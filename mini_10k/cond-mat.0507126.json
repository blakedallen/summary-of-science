Spin-dependent\ntransport in ferromagnetic nanosystems is currently receiving increased attention owing to the expectation\nthat nanoscale size constraints may maximize the potentially useful magnetoresistance effects. In particular, theories have predicted that molecules bridging ferromagnetic electrodes may present pathways for building ultra-small spintronic devices that take advantage\nof weak molecular spin-orbit interaction to maximize\nthe magnetoresistance.1,2,3,4 Recently, experiments have\nbeen reported in which electrons transmitted through insulating octanethiol molecular self-assembled monolayers\n(SAMs) between nickel contacts5 , and through 100nm\norganic molecular films with magnetic electrodes6,7 , retained their spin polarization leading to observed magnetoresistance, proving that individual or groups of organic\nmolecules may potentially be used as building blocks for\nthe ultimate miniaturization of spintronic devices. However, bias dependence and inversion of the magnetoresistance were also reported and were attributed5 to the presence of impurities within the molecular junction. Bias\ndependence of the magnetoresistance has since been predicted in insulating molecular junctions4 , indicating that\nbias-dependent magnetoresistance may be intrinsic to\nmolecular spintronic devices. However, most technological device applications based on magnetoresistance require a relatively bias-independent magnetoresistance for\nstable device operation. In this article, we report predictions of magnetoresistance in ideal molecular spintronic\njunctions where single molecules bridge iron electrodes,\nsystems that until now have received little experimental\nor theoretical attention. We predict strong bias dependence in the positive magnetoresistance regime, but we\nalso predict the magnetoresistance to become negative\nwith increasing applied bias and we show that the magnetoresistance is potentially larger and stable under applied bias in this negative magnetoresistance regime. Our\ncalculations reveal negative magnetoresistance to be an\n\nintrinsic property of some molecular junctions (i.e., unlike the effect reported in Ni/octanethiol/Ni junctions5 ,\nnot dependent on the presence of impurities) and thus\noffer a path to stable operation of devices (such as molecular MRAM) based on molecular spintronics but operating in the negative magnetoresistance regime. Therefore,\nunderstanding the origins of negative magnetoresistance\nis paramount to fundamental studies of spin-dependent\ntransport in molecular junctions and potentially applicable to technological endeavors.\nWe explore theoretically two very different molecular\njunctions: a conducting (conjugated) benzene-dithiolate\n(BDT) molecule and an insulating octane-dithiolate\n(ODT) molecule bridging ferromagnetic Fe nanocontacts.\nThe phenomena that we predict appear in both.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nIn our calculations the system is partitioned into semiinfinite ideal ferromagnetic source and drain leads and an\nextended molecular junction consisting of the molecule\nand clusters of nearby Fe atoms8 ; for BDT this \"extended molecule\" is shown in the inset of Fig.1(a). The\nFe-thiol bonding geometries are estimated with ab initio\nrelaxations.910 The electronic structure of the Fe clusters is described by a tight-binding Hamiltonian and\nnon-orthogonal s, p, d basis. The tight-binding parameters are based on fits to ab initio band structures of\nFe crystals11 and have previously been employed successfully to study magnetic multilayers12 , magnetic13,14\nand non-magnetic15 nanocontacts, and ferromagnetic\nNi molecular junctions1 . For Fe structures with surfaces this model yields spin-resolved surface densities of\nstates and enhanced surface magnetic moments14 similar to those of ab initio surface calculations16 . Thus\nour model incorporates both the bulk and surface magnetic properties of Fe which together influence the spindependent transport through a nanoscale junction of bulk\nFe leads bridged with molecules. Spin flip processes are\nnot considered, consistent with weak spin-orbit interaction in molecules and the high degree of spin polarization retained in spin-dependent observations of molecular junctions.5,6,7 The molecular electronic parameters\n\n\f2\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFig. 1(a) shows the calculated transmission probabilities at zero bias for the BDT molecular junction. The\nspin up \u2192 up (uu) and down \u2192 down (dd) transmission is for parallel magnetization of the two contacts;\nup \u2192 down (ud) is for anti-parallel magnetization. Quite\nsimilar results for the transmissions and currents are obtained if the 5x5 outer Fe layer is deleted from each of\nthe clusters indicating that the clusters and ideal leads\nin our model adequately represent real (macroscopic) Fe\nleads. The molecular HOMO and HOMO-1 give rise\nto the strong transmission 1.5-2eV below the Fermi energy EF = 0eV; the peaks 3-4eV above the Fermi energy are due to the molecular LUMO and LUMO+1.\nThe sharp resonance at 3.1eV results from extremely\nweak hybridization between the Fe leads and the isolated molecule's LUMO which has very little sulfur content. The transmission resonance is present and transmits for all spin configurations.

We adjust this constant to align the Fermi energy\nof the contacts relative to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the BDT molecule, according\nto the difference in ionization energies of the isolated\nstructures estimated with ab initio total energy calculations. For Fe electrodes and the molecules considered here, this agrees well with the difference between\nthe work function of Fe and the HOMO energy of the\nisolated molecule obtained from density functional theory, a method that has been used successfully to align\nthe Fermi energy of gold with the HOMO of BDT.21\nThe potential profile of the nanocontact arising from\nthe bias voltage applied between the two electrodes is\ndifficult to calculate from first principles since it is a\nnon-equilibrium many-body property. However, appropriate heuristic models for the profile can yield accurate results for the current.22 We adopt this approach\nhere, assuming the majority of the applied bias to drop\nover the metal-molecule interface.22,23,2425 Nearly identical current-voltage characteristics emerge if the details of\nthe model potential profile are varied. Thus these details\nare not crucial to our predictions. Our transport calculations are based on Landauer theory26 and LippmannSchwinger and Green's function techniques. We define\n(I\n\u2212Ianti )\n.\nthe junction magnetoresistance as JM R = 1 (Ipar\npar +Ianti )\n2\nIpar (Ianti ) is the current through the junction for parallel (anti-parallel) magnetizations on the Fe electrodes.\n\n2\n\nApplied Bias (V)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (a) Transmission probabilities vs. energy at zero bias for the spin up \u2192 up (uu), down \u2192 down\n(dd), and up \u2192 down (ud) configurations of the BDT molecular junction shown in the inset. Fermi energy = 0eV. (b)\nCurrent vs. voltage for parallel (p) and anti-parallel (a) magnetizations. JMR (j) is also shown.\n\narising from strong hybridization between the molecular sulfur and the Fe d-electron orbitals. In Fig. 1(a)\nthese states give rise to the broad transmission features\nbetween the Fermi energy and the HOMO resonances\nmentioned above. They allow electrons to transmit efficiently through the metal-molecule interface and so give\nrise to moderately strong transmission dominating the\ncurrent in the experimentally accessible moderate bias\nregime. Together with the energetically localized and\nhighly spin-split Fe d bands, these hybrid states give rise\nto strongly spin-dependent transport characteristics.\nAt zero applied bias for parallel magnetization of the\ncontacts, the spin up Fe d orbitals hybridize very strongly\nwith sulfur states on both sides of the molecule as shown\nfor a typical state in Fig. 2(a). This results in the\ndominant uu transmission near (below) the Fermi energy in Fig. 1(a). The spin down d orbitals, occurring\nhigher in energy, hybridize only weakly with molecular sulfur states. For anti-parallel magnetizations [i.e.,\nup(down) \u2192 down(up) transmission], only the source\n(drain) contact hybridizes strongly with the molecular\nend group (Fig. 2(b)), resulting in much weaker ud transmission (anti-parallel magnetization) than the uu transmission in Fig. 1(a). As the hybrid states are not located\nexactly at the Fermi energy they contribute to the current\nat very low bias through their off-resonant tails.\nAn applied bias breaks the symmetry between the\nsource and drain electrodes in the parallel magnetization\nconfiguration. Thus the symmetric zero bias molecular\norbitals (as in Fig. 2(a)) are supplanted by states associated mainly with either the source or drain electrode as\nshown in in Figure 2(c,d) for the uu transmission. The\norbital in Figure 2(c) is shifted upwards in energy and is\nassociated with the source electrode, while that in Fig-\n\n\f3\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(ud 0V)\n\n(uu 0V)\n(d)\n\n(c)\n\n(uu Drain 0.1V)\n\n(uu Source 0.1V)\n\n(e)\n\n(f)\n\n(uu 1.0V)\n\n(ud 1.0V)\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Representative hybridized energy\neigenstates of the entire extended molecule near the Fermi\nenergy are depicted on the BDT molecule and the 2x2 Fe\nplanes on either side. (a) At 0V the uu source and drain electrode d states hybridize with sulfur orbitals on both sides of\nthe molecule forming transmitting states. (b) Only the source\nstrongly hybridizes with the sulfur states in the ud configuration. At 0.1V, uu states in (a) split into a state mainly\non the source (c) that shifts upwards in energy and a state\nmainly on the drain (d) that shifts downwards. (e) At 1.0V\nuu hybridized states on the source and drain have shifted well\napart. (f) Source up hybridized states are shifted into resonance with drain down states in the ud configuration creating\nstates that transmit strongly through the molecule.\n\nure 2(d) is shifted downwards and is associated with the\ndrain. These orbitals can be traced to the zero bias orbital in Figure 2(a) and their energy splitting corresponds\nto the applied bias. Since the energies of these states are\nnot perfectly aligned, simultaneous resonant transmission\nthrough both ends of the molecule is impossible. However, since the states remain close in energy at moderate\nbias, they both contribute coherently to near-resonant\ntransmission via the extended molecule's Green's function in the Lippmann-Schwinger scattering formalism:\nThere is appreciable coherent mixing between their offresonant transmission tails resulting in relatively strong\nuu transmission. The corresponding molecular orbital for\nud transmission resembles that shown for the source electrode in the uu configuration in Figure 2(c), however a\nstate corresponding to the uu drain state is absent. The\nreverse is true for du transmission and since these two\ntransmission processes are mutually incoherent, there is\nno mixing of their off-resonant tails and the current in\nthe case of anti-parallel magnetizations is weaker.\nFig. 1(b) shows the corresponding finite-bias currentvoltage characteristics. At low bias, the current grows\n\nas more hybridized states contribute to the transmission.\nSince the uu transmission dominates, the parallel magnetization current is larger, resulting in a positive magnetoresistance of about 10 percent. At larger applied bias,\nthe applied electrostatic potential breaks the symmetry\nbetween the contacts further and the uu transmission decreases as the hybridized Fe d states associated with the\nsource and drain move apart. However, at high bias in\nthe case of anti-parallel magnetizations, hybridized states\nassociated with down d electron orbitals on the drain\nare shifted into resonance with up d electron states on\nthe source and hybridized transmitting states connecting\nboth sides of the molecule with the electrodes form in the\ncase of up \u2192 down transmission as shown in Fig. 2(f),\nenhancing the transmission. No such resonant effect occurs for du transmission which decreases with increasing\nbias and so the overall effect of the applied bias on the net\ntransmission for anti-parallel magnetization is small. No\nresonant enhancement occurs at increased bias for parallel magnetizations where hybridized states are shifted\napart (Fig. 2(e)) and transmission is reduced. Therefore,\nbecause it selectively depresses transmission for parallel\nmagnetization of the contacts, the bias-induced symmetry breaking results in a crossover with increasing bias\nfrom positive to negative values of the JMR in Fig. 1(b).\nThe wave functions of the hybridized states responsible for transport at moderate bias are located primarily\non the Fe electrodes. Therefore their energy levels are\npinned to the electrodes and shift rigidly with applied\nbias explaining why our moderate bias results are insensitive to the assumed potential profile. If one partitions\nthe entire system into halves associated with either the\nsource or with the drain so that the hybridized states on\nthe source (drain) side of the system are grouped with\nthe source (drain) to form a \"composite\" source (drain)\nelectrode, the negative magnetoresistance argument can\nbe rephrased in the language of conventional solid-state\nmagnetic tunnel junctions: At the bias required to bring\nhybridized down states on the drain into resonance with\nhybridized up states on the source, the spin polarization\nof the composite drain is negative (the current is dominated by down electrons) while that of the composite\nsource remains positive. Therefore, the Julliere27 theory\nof tunneling would predict negative magnetoresistance.\nBecause its mechanism relies on the simultaneous suppression of transmission for parallel magnetizations on\nthe contacts and enhancement of the transmission in\nthe anti-parallel ud transmission channel, this intrinsic\nnegative magnetoresistance requires strongly spin-split\nenergy bands providing a large magnetic moment. No\nsuch negative magnetoresistance has been reported for\ncalculations on molecules bridging ferromagnetic nickel\njunctions1,2,3,4 and our calculations on similar systems\nsuggest that this different behavior may be related to the\nsmaller spin-splitting in Ni: At sufficient bias to induce\nresonant transmission in the ud channel (the required\nbias is relatively small for Ni) much symmetry and overlap remain in the uu transmission channel where energy\n\n\f4\n0.01\n\n(a)\nT(E)\n\n0.008\n0.006\n\ndd\n\nud\n\n0.004\n0.002\nuu\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nE(eV)\n\n-3\n\nI (10 e/h)\n\n(b)\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n\n0.2\n0.1\n\na\n\nj\n\n0\n\np\n\nJMR\n\nlevels are not adequately shifted apart. Therefore the\nmechanism should be less effective in nanosystems based\non nickel2829 .\nFor BDT bridging Fe nanocontacts, the crossover to\nnegative magnetoresistance occurs at relatively low bias,\nnear 0.7V, well within the range of current experimental\ntechniques and therefore the predicted negative magnetoresistance should be accessible to experiment. With\nmagnitude reaching a value of more than 30 percent, the\nnegative magnetoresistance may be more easily observed\nin this system than positive values. Clearly the mechanism is expected to be unique to systems that can both\nsustain a significant potential drop and allow for resonant transmission of d-electrons through the junction,\ni.e., nanosystems. Negative magnetoresistance emerging\nas a result of applied bias has already been observed experimentally in systems where ferromagnetic electrodes\nare separated by thin film tunnel junctions of only a few\nnanometers in width where the junction couples strongly\nto the electrode d states31,32 . Since d-electrons are not\nexpected to contribute to transport in conventional thin\nfilm magnetic tunnel junctions12,33,34,35 , negative magnetoresistance when observed in those devices is attributed\nto impurities.36 However, we predict intrinsic negative\nmagnetoresistance in ideal systems demonstrating that\nbias-dependent and negative magnetoresistance are not\nnecessarily signatures of impurities in molecular nanosystems.\nInterestingly, the region exhibiting the greatest\nbias independence in our magnetoresistance calculations emerges in the negative magnetoresistance regime\n(around 1.7V in Figure 1(b)). Since magnetoresistance\ndevices can in principle exploit magnetoresistance of either sign but require a relatively bias independent magnetoresistance for stable device operation, molecular-Fe\nsystems may be attractive candidates for technological\napplications in devices based on molecular spintronics\n(molecular MRAM) but operated in the negative magnetoresistance regime.\nFor comparison, we have also studied an Fe/BDT/Fe\nmolecular junction having a different geometry where single Fe tip atoms have been added to each of the clusters\nand the molecular sulfur atoms bind directly over them\nat the same heights considered previously. This geometry results in stronger and sharper resonances associated\nwith the hybridized states and therefore the mechanism\nresponsible for negative JMR is even more prominent.\nHere we find the cross-over to negative magnetoresistance\nto occur at a lower bias voltage of 0.25V .\nNext we consider ferromagnetic Fe contacts bridged\nwith an octane-dithiolate (ODT) molecule, shown in Fig.\n3(a) with the zero bias transmission probabilities. As\nODT is an insulator, the strongest transmission features\nnear the Fermi energy are weak resonant features associated with the HOMO, about 1.8eV below the Fermi\nenergy. Other weakly transmitting states appear closer\nto the Fermi energy (about 0.5 eV below) due to hybridization of Fe d and molecular sulfur orbitals.

Notation as in Fig.1.\n\nstates are similar to those predicted in the case of BDT:\nthe up \u2192 up transmission is largest as hybridization occurs at both ends of the molecule allowing for efficient\ntransmission into and out of the metal-molecule interface,\ndecreasing the width of the tunnel gap. The calculated\ncurrent-voltage characteristics are shown in Figure 3(b).\nAt moderate bias, the symmetry between the source and\ndrain electrodes in the parallel magnetization configuration leads to positive magnetoresistance. At higher applied bias, by the same mechanism described for BDT,\nthe magnetoresistance becomes negative, but here the\ncrossover doesn't occur until nearly 1.2V. Again a large\nregion of relative bias stability emerges in the negative\nbias regime (around 1.5V in Figure 3(b)) with possible\nimplications for future molecular spintronic technology.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn conclusion: We have predicted an inverse magnetoresistance phenomenon intrinsic to systems where ferromagnetic Fe electrodes are bridged by two very different molecules (conducting and insulating), and for\ndifferent bonding geometries. We also predict qualitatively similar behavior in Fe junctions bridged by a pair\nof Fe atoms.14 Thus negative magnetoresistance should\nbe available in a variety of molecular junctions under\nappropriate conditions. The value of the bias required\nto induce negative magnetoresistance depends on the\nchemistry of the junction: 0.25-0.7V for Fe/benzenedithiolate/Fe (depending on the bonding geometry), 1.2V\nfor Fe/octane-dithiolate/Fe and higher still14 for Fe contacts bridged by a Fe dimer. These changes in the chemistry make it possible to vary the onset of negative magnetoresistance, the magnitudes of both positive and negative magnetoresistances and the regions of bias indepen-\n\n\f5\ndence important for device applications.\nV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nThis work was supported by NSERC and the Canadian\nInstitute for Advanced Research.\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n13\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nE.

However, ferromagnetism (and the associated JMR) in manganese is limited to very small atomic clusters and does\nnot occur for macroscopic Mn leads.30\nC. Demangeat, J. C. Parlebas, Rep. Prog.
