Trifonov\nInstitute for nuclear research,\n72 Tzarigradsko chaussee, 1784 Sofia, Bulgaria\nNovember 10, 2018\nAbstract\nIt is shown by examples that the position uncertainty on a circle, proposed recently by Kowalski\nand Rembieli\u0144ski [J.

We\nargue that the relevant uncertainties and uncertainty relations (UR's) on a circle are that based on\nthe Gram-Robertson matrix. Several of these generalized UR's are displayed and related criterions\nfor squeezed states are discussed.\n\n1. In the recent paper [1] the problem of relevant uncertainty relation (UR) for the angular\nmomentum and the angle variables of a particle on a circle was discussed and a new UR was proposed.\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302)\nNoting a contradiction in the previously obtained UR [2] the authors defined new quantities \u2206\n2\n \u0303 (J)\n\u02c6 (\u03c6\u0302 = \u03c6, J\u02c6 = \u2212id/d\u03c6) as measures for the uncertainty of the angle \u03c6 and the angular\nand \u2206\nmomentum J and suggest the inequality\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) + \u2206\n \u0303 2 (J)\n\u02c6 \u2265 1.\n\u2206\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302), \u2206\n \u0303 2 (J)\n\u02c6 are defined as [1] (note a change in notation: \u22062 \u2192 \u2206\n \u0303 2)\nThe quantities \u2206\n\u0010\n\u0011\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) = \u2212 1 ln hU 2 i 2 ,\n \u0303 2 (J)\n\u02c6 = 1 ln he\u22122J\u02c6ihe2J\u02c6i ,\n\u2206\n\u2206\n4\n4\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere U = exp(i\u03c6\u0302). The authors of [1] find that for the eigenstates |zi of the operator Z = exp(\u2212J\u02c6 +\n1/2)U , Z|zi = z|zi (the \"genuine coherent states (CS's) for a quantum particle on a circle\" [3])\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) and \u2206\n \u0303 2 (J\u02c6) obey the inequality (1) in any\nboth quantities (2) equal 1/2, and suggest that \u2206\n2\n2 \u02c6\n \u0303\n \u0303\nstate. Henceforth, the quantities \u2206 (\u03c6\u0302) and \u2206 (J) should be referred to as Kowalski-Rembieli\u0144ski\nuncertainties ((K-R) uncertainties), the UR (1) \u2013 as K-R UR and |zi \u2013 as Kowalski-Rembieli\u0144skiPapaloucas CS's (K-R-P CS's).\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) is not consistent with the state\n2. Next we shall demonstrate that the K-R uncertainty \u2206\nlocalization on a circle. For this purpose we compare the \u03c6\u2013probability distributions p\u03c8 (\u03c6) (defined as\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302).\np\u03c8 (\u03c6) = |\u03c8(\u03c6)|2 = |h\u03c6|\u03c8i|2 ) in K-R-P CS's with \u03c6\u2013distributions in certain states with squeezed \u2206\n2\n \u0303\nThe quantity \u2206 (\u03c6\u0302) is called [1] squeezed if it is less that than 1/2. The authors of [1] constructed\na family of such squeezed states |zis as eigenstates of the operator Z(s) = exp(\u2212sJ\u02c6 + s/2)U =\n\u02c6 where s is positive parameter. Here we shall consider \u2206\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302)\u2013squeezed states of the form\nexp(i\u03c6 \u2212 sJ),\n2\nof eigenstates |z, ai of the squared operator Z . These are defined as macroscopic superpositions of\n|zi and | \u2212 zi (Schr\u00f6dinger cat states on a circle),\n|z, ai = N (z, a) (|zi + a |\u2212zi),\n1\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere a is complex parameter, and the normalization constant N (z, a) takes the form\n\u0002\n\u0003\u22121/2\nN (z, a) = 1 + | a|2 + 2hz|\u2212ziRe a\n.\n\n(4)\n\nThe scalar product of two CS's is [1] hz|\u03b7i = \u03b83 ((i/2\u03c0) ln(z \u2217 \u03b7), i/\u03c0), where \u03b83 (x, y) is the Jacobi\ntheta-function. The states |z, a = \u00b11i \u2261 |z; \u00b1i should be called even/odd CS on a circle.\nOn the states |z, ai the quantities hU 2 i, hexp(2J)i, hexp(\u22122J)i in (2) take the form\nh a, z|U 2 |z, ai = N 2 (z, a)(hz|U 2 |zi + | a|2 h\u2212z|U 2 |\u2212zi + ahz|U 2 |\u2212zi + a\u2217 h\u2212z|U 2 |zi),\n\u0001\u0001\nh a, z|e\u00b12J |z, ai = N 2 (z, a) hz|e\u00b12J |zi + | a|2 h\u2212z|e\u00b12J |\u2212zi + 2Re ahz|e\u00b12J |\u2212zi ,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere hz|U 2 |zi, hz|e2J |zi and hz|e\u22122J |zi are given by z/ez \u2217, e/|z|2 and e|z|2 respectively [1]. Substituting (5) and (6) in (2) we obtain explicit formulas for K\u2013R uncertainties in |z, ai.\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302)\u2013squeezing occurs in many superpositions |z, ai,\nFrom formulas (2), (5) and (6) we find that \u2206\nin particular in |z; \u00b1i (see figure 1). In the odd state |1; \u2212i, corresponding to the solid line minimum\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) \u2248 0.33, which is considerably less than the value 1/2 of \u2206\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) in CS's |zi.\nin figure 1, we find \u2206\nOne should expect that the \u03c6-distribution, corresponding to wave functions with squeezed \"position\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) are better localized on the circle than the non-squeezed CS. Unfortunately it is\nuncertainty\" \u2206\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302)\u2013squeezed states from the family {|z, ai}. This inconsistency is demonstrated\nnot the case with \u2206\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302)\u2013squeezed state\nin figure 2 on the example of cat state |1; \u2212i. As one can see from figure 2 the \u2206\n|1; \u2212i is much worse localized than the non-squeezed CS |zi (p(\u03c6)-distributions of |zi with different z\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) is not a proper measure\napproximately coincide up to a translation). Therefore the quantity \u2206\nof the position uncertainty, and the inequality (1) could hardly be qualified as a relevant uncertainty\nrelation on a circle.\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302) and \u2206\n \u0303 2 (J),\n\u02c6 the case of\nLet us note that |z, ai saturate the inequality (1) with unequal \u2206\nz = 1 and real a being demonstrated in figure 1. However the whole range of validity of (1) is not yet\nclarified. Nevertheless it might be interesting to note that in the variety of states on the real line a\n \u0303 2 (x\u0302) + \u2206\n \u0303 2 (p\u0302) \u2265 1, where x\u0302, p\u0302 are position and momentum operators.\nsimilar inequality hold, i.e. \u2206\n\n3. The above remarks naturally raise again the questions about the position and angular momentum uncertainties and the relevant uncertainty relations (UR's) on a circle. In my opinion most\nsuitable UR's for n observables Xi and one state |\u03c8i on a circle are those based on the Gram\u2013Robertson\nmatrix G = {Gij } of the form [4] (i, j = 1, . . . , n; n = 1, 2, . . .)\nGij (\u03c8) = h(Xi \u2212 hXi i)\u03c8|(Xj \u2212 hXj i)\u03c8i.\n\n(7)\n\n~ = X1 , X2 ) for this matrix and its elements\n~ \u03c8) and GXi Xj (\u03c8) (X\nMore informative notations G(X;\nshould also be used.

The senior characteristic UR reads\n~ \u03c8) \u2265 det A(X;\n~ \u03c8) .\ndet S(X;\n\n(9)\n\n2\nIn the simplest case of n = 2 this UR is displayed as S11 S22 \u2212 S12\n\u2265 A212 .

Under these conditions the inequality (9)\nshould not be confused with the K-R quantity \u2206\ntakes the form of Robertson UR for n observables [7, 4, 8], and (10) coincides with the Schr\u00f6dinger\n(or Schr\u00f6dinger\u2013Robertson) UR [9] (for a review on this UR and its minimization states see e.g. [8]).\nThe generalized form of the less precise Heisenberg UR reads g \u2206X1 g \u2206X2 \u2265 |ImG12 |, and it again\nfollows from the more precise one (10). About similar generalization see also [5, 6]. (Please note that\nin some papers, e.g. [10], no distinction is made between Schr\u00f6dinger and Heisenberg UR's, both\nbeing named after Heisenberg).\nThus in the special cases when Xi Xj |\u03c8i are not properly defined one should resort to generalized\nSchr\u00f6dinger UR (10) (for two observables), and to (9) (for several observables). The position and the\nangular momentum observables of a particle on a circle represent such a special case, since \u03c6\u0302h\u03c6|\u03c8i =\n\u03c6h\u03c6|\u03c8i is not 2\u03c0-periodic and J\u02c6 is not Hermitian on such functions. Another special case of interest\nis particle motion on the sphere.\nFigure 3 illustrates the generalized UR (10) in the case of X1 = J\u02c6 and X2 = \u03c6\u0302 and states |z, ai\n~ z, a) are plotted as functions of real a for z = 0.4\n(particle on a circle), where det G(z, a) = det G(X;\n(solid line) and z = 1 (dashed line). In these states the generalized covariance g \u2206\u03c6J = ReGJ\u03c6\nvanishes, also g \u2206\u03c6 = \u2206\u03c6, g \u2206J = \u2206J, so that here we have det G = (\u2206\u03c6)2 (\u2206J)2 \u2212 (ImGJ\u03c6 )2 \u2265 0.\nThe minimal value of det G on figure 3 is different from zero (it is about 0.00017).\n \u0303 2 (J)\n\u02c6 and \u2206\n \u0303 2 (\u03c6\u0302), the variances (\u2206J)2 and (\u2206\u03c6)2 are in good correspondence with the\nUnlike \u2206\nangular momentum and position localization on a circle. For example, \u03c6-distributions for CS's |zi\nwith z = 0.4, 1 practically are the same (see figure 2), and the variances (\u2206\u03c6)2 in these CS are almost\nequal: in |z = 0.4i (\u2206\u03c6)2 = 0.50055, and in |z = 1i (\u2206\u03c6)2 = 0.50064. In the worse localized cat state\n|1; \u2212i (see figure 2) the variance (\u2206\u03c6)2 takes the larger value of 3.813.\nWe have to warn that one has to be careful about the correspondence between \u2206\u03c6\u2013squeezing\nand localization of the wave function h\u03c6|\u03c8i: in view of the identification of points \u03c6 and \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 the\nmeanvalues h\u03c6i, h\u03c62 i should be calculated by integration from \u03c60 \u2212 \u03c0 to \u03c60 + \u03c0, where \u03c60 is the center\nof the wave packet (i.e. \u03c60 is the most probable value of \u03c6). In this way we find that both standard\ndeviations \u2206\u03c6 and \u2206J in K-R-P CS's |zi show very small oscillations around the value of 1/2. So,\nthe family {|zi} consists of almost minimum uncertainty states on the circle.\n\n4. The minimization states (intelligent, or minimum-uncertainty states) of the generalized UR\n(10) for X1 and X2 should be eigenstates of a real or complex combination \u03bcX1 + \u03bdX2 . In the case of\nthe particle on a circle and X1 = J\u02c6 and X2 = \u03c6\u0302 the 2\u03c0\u2013periodicity condition on the wave functions\n\u03c8(\u03c6 + 2\u03c0) = \u03c8(\u03c6) should be imposed (some authors admit exceptions [6]). This restriction rules out\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nall solutions of\n\u221a the eigenvalue equation (\u03bcJ + \u03bd \u03c6\u0302)|\u03c8i = z|\u03c8i, except\n\u221a for the eigenstates \u03c8m (\u03c6) of J,\n\u03c8m (\u03c6) = (1/ 2\u03c0) exp(im\u03c6). For \u03c8m (\u03c6) we have \u2206J = 0, \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0, GJ\u03c6 = 0, so that the equality\nin UR (10) reads 0 = 0. None of the states |z, ai and |zis minimize the inequalities (10), although\nthe deviations in the case of CS's |zi are very small, as it is illustrated in figure 3 at a = 0.\nIn order to define squeezed states on the circle let us recall that for the particle on the real line\nthese states are defined by means of one of the two inequalities (\u2206x)2 < |h[x, p]i|/2 = 1/2, or (\u2206p)2 <\n|h[x, p]i|/2 = 1/2. Since ImG12 (\u03c8) is a generalization of the mean commutator (\u2212i/2)h[X1 , X2 ]i one\ncan define X1 -X2 squeezed states more generally as states, for which\n(g \u2206Xi )2 < |ImG12 (\u03c8)|,\n\ni = 1 or 2.\n\n(11)\n\nThis is a generalization of the well known Eberly-Wodkiewicz criterion for squeezed states. It however\nis a relative criterion, since the \"generalized mean commutator\" |ImG12 (\u03c8)| may take, in general,\nvalues from 0 to \u221e. Another and stronger criterion for squeezed states is suggested by the observation\nthat on the real line (and for the one mode electromagnetic field) 1/2 is the minimal value that two\nvariances (\u2206x)2 and (\u2206p)2 can take simultaneously. Therefore we can define X1 -X2 squeezed states\n3\n\n\fmore generally as states, for which one of the following two inequalities holds,\n(g \u2206Xi )2 < \u220620 ,\n\ni = 1 or 2,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u220620 is the minimal value that the two generalized variances can take simultaneously. For\nincompatible observables \u22060 > 0. It is plausible that 2\u220620 is the lower limit of the sum of two\nvariances,\n(\u2206X1 )2 + (\u2206X2 )2 \u2265 2\u220620 .\n(13)\n\nIf the eigenstates of X1 + iX2 (or X1 \u2212 iX2 ) exist (canonical observables, spin and quasi-spin components e.t.c.), then \u220620 is equal to the minimal value of |ImGJ\u03c6 (\u03c8)| within these eigenstates, and (13)\nis rigorously valid [8]. If eigenstates of X1 \u00b1 iX2 do not exist, the critical quantity \u22060 should be estimated by different methods. The case of X1 = J\u02c6 and X2 = \u03c6\u0302 is such a special case, since 2\u03c0\u2013periodic\neigenfunctions of \u03c6\u0302 \u00b1 iJ\u02c6 do not exist. Numerical considerations suggest that in this case \u220620 \u2248 0.5\n(more precisely \u2248 0.49999), which is the minimal value that (\u2206\u03c6)2 and (\u2206J)2 take simultaneously in\nCS's |zi.\nIt turned out that both criterions (11) and (12) can be satisfied in many states from the families\n{|z, ai} and {|zis }. Squeezing of \u2206\u03c6 in |z, ai is not very strong, while in |zis it can be arbitrarily\nstrong.\nOf course |zi are exact Heisenberg intelligent states for the Hermitian components X, Y of Z.\nHowever neither \u2206X nor \u2206Y is in a satisfactory correspondence with the localization on a circle, as\none can easily check it on the example of cat states |z; \u00b1i.\nIn conclusion we note that the above described scheme can be extended to represent correct\ngeneralized UR's for several observables and (several) mixed states as well [4].\n\nReferences\n[1] Kowalski K. and Rembieli\u0144ski J. 2002, On the uncertainty relations and squeezed states for the\nquantum mechanics on a circle, J.
