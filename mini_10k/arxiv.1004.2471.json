In this article we study Ammann tilings from the perspective of symplectic geometry. Ammann tilings are nonperiodic tilings that are related to quasicrystals with icosahedral symmetry. We associate to each Ammann tiling two explicitly constructed highly\nsingular symplectic spaces and we show that they are diffeomorphic but not symplectomorphic. These spaces inherit from the tiling its very interesting symmetries.\nKey words: symplectic quasifold; nonperiodic tiling; quasilattice\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification: 53D20; 52C23\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOur general aim is to study the connection between symplectic geometry and the nonperiodic\ntilings that are related to the geometry of quasicrystals1 . Considering these tilings from the\nsymplectic viewpoint provides a concrete way of obtaining new examples of highly singular\nsymplectic spaces that are endowed with very rich symmetries. These examples effectively\ncontribute to understanding the theoretical aspects of the geometry of this type of singular\nspaces. Moreover, we expect that symplectic geometry may be used to shed light on the study\nof the tilings.\nWe started this program with the study of two tilings of the plane: Penrose rhombus [2]\nand kite and dart [3] tilings.\nIn this article we focus our attention for the first time on three-dimensional tilings. We\nconsider Ammann tilings, which are the three-dimensional analogues of Penrose rhombus tilings.\nThey were introduced by Ammann in the 70's [10] and turned out to be related to quasicrystals\nwith icosahedral symmetry [6]. As we will see later, the third dimension yields an initially\nunexpected richness and complexity.\nThe main idea underlying the connection between symplectic geometry and tilings is a generalization [8] of the Delzant construction [5], which we use to associate to each tile an explicitly\nconstructed symplectic space. We recall that the Delzant \u0001construction associates a symplectic\n\u2217\ntoric 2n-manifold to each simple convex polytope in Rn , which is rational with respect to\na lattice and satisfies an additional integrality condition. The problem, in the setting of nonperiodic tilings related to quasicrystals, is that either the tiles are not individually rational,\nor they are not simultaneously rational with respect to the same lattice. In the generalized\n1\n\nQuasicrystals are special materials having discrete nonperiodic diffraction patterns that were experimentally\ndiscovered by Shechtman et al. [11] in 1982. They have atomic arrangements with symmetries that are not allowed\nin ordinary crystals. For a comprehensive review of this fascinating subject we refer the reader to the recent book\nby Steurer and Deloudi [12].\n\n\f2\n\nF. Battaglia and E. Prato\n\nconstruction, however, the lattice is replaced by a quasilattice and rationality is replaced by the\nnotion of quasirationality. The resulting space is a 2n-dimensional quasifold, a generalization of\nmanifolds and orbifolds that was first introduced by the second-named author in [8]; the group\nacting is no longer a torus but a quasitorus [8].\nAmmann tilings are made of two kinds of tiles: an oblate rhombohedron and a prolate rhombohedron having same edge lengths. These rhombohedra, although separately rational, are not\nsimultaneously rational with respect to the same lattice. However, the geometry of the tiling ensures that it is possible to choose a quasilattice F having the property that each rhombohedron\nof the tiling is quasirational with respect to F (Proposition 3.1). We then apply the generalized Delzant construction simultaneously to each rhombohedron and we show that there is one\nsymplectic quasifold, Mb , associated to each of the oblate rhombohedra of the tiling and one\nsymplectic quasifold, Mr , associated to each of the prolate rhombohedra (Theorem 4.1). Both\nquasifolds are globally the quotient of a manifold (the product of three 2-spheres) modulo the\naction of a discrete group. There is a unique diffeotype and two symplectotypes associated to\nthe tiling. In fact, we show that Mb and Mr are diffeomorphic but not symplectomorphic, consistently with the fact that the two different types of tiles have different volumes (Theorem 6.1).\nWe remark that quasilattices are the fundamental structure underlying both nonperiodic\ntilings related to quasicrystals and the corresponding symplectic quasifolds. This is particularly\nevident for Ammann tilings, and the related physics of icosahedral quasicrystals. The novelty\nhere, with respect to two-dimensional tilings, is that, in this context, there are actually three\nimportant quasilattices: the quasilattice F above, known as face-centered lattice, the bodycentered lattice, I, and the simple icosahedral lattice, P . These are the only three quasilattices\nthat have icosahedral symmetry [9]. The quasilattice P , up to a suitable rescaling, has the\nproperty of containing all of the vertices of the Ammann tiling. The quasilattices F and 12 I\nare usually thought of in physics as the dual of each other, as they are projections of two 6dimensional lattices that are dual to one another in the standard sense. Consistently, we show\nthat, in our symplectic setting, F is the group quasilattice of the quasitorus D3 = R3 /F and\nthat 12 I can be thought of as its dual, the weight quasilattice (Section 5).\nThe paper is structured as follows: in Section 2 we recall the generalized Delzant construction;\nin Section 3 we introduce the quasilattices F , I and P , and we discuss their connection with\nthe tiling; in Section 4 we construct the symplectic quasifolds Mb and Mr ; in Section 5 we\nstudy their local geometry; finally, in Section 6 we show that they are diffeomorphic but not\nsymplectomorphic.\n\n2\n\nThe generalized Delzant construction\n\nWe now recall from [8] the generalized Delzant construction. For the notion of quasifold, of\nrelated geometrical objects and for a number of examples we refer the reader to the original\narticle [8] and to [3], where some of the definitions were reformulated.\nLet us recall what a simple convex polytope is.\n\u0001\u2217\nDefinition 2.1 (simple polytope). A dimension n convex polytope \u2206 \u2282 Rn is said to be\nsimple if there are exactly n edges stemming from each vertex.\nLet us next define the notion of quasilattice, introduced in [7]:\nDefinition 2.2 (quasilattice). Let E be a real vector space. A quasilattice in E is the Z-span\nof a set of R-spanning vectors, Y1 , . . . , Yd , of E.\nNotice that SpanZ {Y1 , . . . , Yd } is a lattice if and only if it admits a set of generators which is\na basis of E.\n\n\fAmmann Tilings in Symplectic Geometry\nConsider now a dimension n convex polytope \u2206 \u2282 Rn\nelements X1 , . . . , Xd in Rn and \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbd in R such that\n\u2206=\n\nd\n\\\n\b\n\n\u03bc \u2208 Rn\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n3\n\u0001\u2217\n\nhaving d facets.

A convex polytope\nn \u2217\n\u2206\u2282 R\nis said to be quasirational with respect to Q if the vectors X1 , . . . , Xd in (2.1) can\nbe chosen in Q.\n\u0001\u2217\nWe remark that each polytope in Rn is quasirational with respect to some quasilattice Q:\njust take the quasilattice that is generated by the elements X1 , . . . , Xd in (2.1). Notice that\nif X1 , . . . , Xd can be chosen in such a way that they belong to a lattice, then the polytope is\nrational in the usual sense. Before we go on to describing the generalized Delzant construction\nwe recall what a quasitorus is.\n\nDefinition 2.4 (quasitorus). Let Q \u2282 Rn be a quasilattice. We call quasitorus of dimension n\nthe group and quasifold D = Rn /Q.\nFor the definition of Hamiltonian action of a quasitorus on a symplectic quasifold we refer\nthe reader to [8].\nFor the purposes of this article we will restrict our attention to the special case n = 3.\nTheorem\n2.1 (generalized Delzant construction [8]). Let Q be a quasilattice in R3 and let \u2206 \u2282\n\u0001\n3 \u2217\nR\nbe a simple convex polytope that is quasirational with respect to Q. Then there exists a 6dimensional compact connected symplectic quasifold M and an effective Hamiltonian action of\nthe quasitorus D = R3 /Q on M such that the image of the corresponding moment mapping is \u2206.\nProof .

Take now vectors X1 , . . . , Xd \u2208 Q and real numbers \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbd as\nin (2.1). Consider the surjective linear mapping\n\u03c0 : Rd \u2212\u2192 R3\nej 7\u2212\u2192 Xj .\n\n\f4\n\nF. Battaglia and E. Prato\n\nFigure 1. The oblate rhombohedron.\n\nFigure 2. The prolate rhombohedron.\n\nConsider the dimension 3 quasitorus D = R3 /Q. Then the linear mapping \u03c0 induces a quasitorus\nepimorphism \u03a0 : T d \u2212\u2192 D. Define now N to be the kernel of the mapping \u03a0 and choose\nd\nP\n\u03bb=\n\u03bbj e\u2217j . Denote by i the Lie algebra inclusion Lie(N ) \u2192 Rd and notice that \u03a8 = i\u2217 \u25e6 J\nj=1\n\nis a moment mapping for the induced action of N on Cd . Then the quasitorus T d /N acts in\na Hamiltonian fashion on the compact symplectic quasifold M = \u03a8\u22121 (0)/N . If we identify the\nquasitori D and T d /N via the epimorphism \u03a0, we get a Hamiltonian action of the quasitorus D\nwhose moment mapping \u03a6 has image equal to (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 (C\u03bb \u2229 ker i\u2217 ) = (\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 (C\u03bb \u2229 im \u03c0 \u2217 ) =\n(\u03c0 \u2217 )\u22121 (\u03c0 \u2217 (\u2206)) which is exactly \u2206. This action is effective since the level set \u03a8\u22121 (0) contains\npoints of the form z \u2208 Cd , zj 6= 0, j = 1, . . . , d, where the T d -action is free. Notice finally that\ndim M = 2d \u2212 2 dim N = 2d \u2212 2(d \u2212 3) = 6.\n\u0004\n\u0001\n\u2217\nRemark 2.1. If we want to apply this construction to any simple convex polytope in R3 ,\nthen there are two arbitrary choices involved. The first is the choice of a quasilattice Q with\nrespect to which the polytope is quasirational, and the second is the choice of vectors X1 , . . . , Xd\nin Q that are orthogonal to the facets of \u2206 and inward-pointing as in (2.1).\n\n3\n\nAmmann tilings and quasilattices\n\nThe purpose of this section is to introduce three quasilattices P , F and I, that are relevant for\nour construction.\n\u221a\nLet \u03c6 = 1+2 5 be the golden ratio. We will be using extensively the following fundamental\nidentity\n\u03c6=1+\n\n1\n.\n\u03c6\n\n(3.1)\n\nLet \u03c3 be a positive real number and let us consider an Ammann tiling T with fixed edge\nlength \u03c3. Ammann tilings are nonperiodic tilings of three-dimensional space by so-called golden\nrhombohedra; rhombohedra are called golden when their facets are given by golden rhombuses,\nnamely rhombuses with diagonals that are in the ratio of \u03c6. There are two types of such\nrhombohedra which are called oblate and prolate (see Figs. 1 and 2)2 . For a review of Ammann\ntilings we refer the reader to [10, 12].\n\u0001\u2217\nConsider now the vectors in R3\n\u03b11 =\n\u03b14 =\n\n\u221a1 (\u03c6 \u2212 1, 1, 0),\n2\n\u221a1 (1 \u2212 \u03c6, 1, 0),\n2\n\n\u03b12 =\n\u03b15 =\n\n\u221a1 (0, \u03c6 \u2212 1, 1),\n2\n\u221a1 (0, 1 \u2212 \u03c6, 1),\n2\n\n\u03b13 =\n\u03b16 =\n\n\u221a1 (1, 0, \u03c6 \u2212 1),\n2\n\u221a1 (1, 0, 1 \u2212 \u03c6).\n2\n\nThese six vectors and their opposites\npoint to the twelve vertices of an icosahedron that is\nq\n3\u2212\u03c6\ninscribed in the sphere of radius\n2 (see Figs. 3 and 4); they generate a quasilattice P that\nis known in physics as the simple icosahedral lattice [9].\n2\n\nAll pictures were drawn using the ZomeCAD software.\n\n\fAmmann Tilings in Symplectic Geometry\n\nFigure 3.

The icosahedron.\n\nq\n2\nLet \u03b4 =\n3\u2212\u03c6 \u03c3 and consider the two following golden rhombohedra: the oblate rhombohedron \u2206ob , having nonparallel edges \u03b4\u03b14 , \u03b4\u03b15 , \u03b4\u03b16 , and the prolate rhombohedron \u2206or , having\nnonparallel edges \u03b4\u03b11 , \u03b4\u03b12 , \u03b4\u03b13 .\nDenote by AB one edge of the tiling T . From now on we will choose our coordinates so that\nA = O and so that B \u2212 A is parallel to \u03b11 with the same orientation.\nProposition 3.1. Let T be an Ammann tiling with edges of length \u03c3. Each vertex of the tiling\nlies in the quasilattice \u03b4P . Moreover, for each oblate rhombohedron \u2206b in T (respectively prolate\nrhombohedron \u2206r in T ) there is a rigid motion \u03c1, given by the composition of a translation with\na transformation of the icosahedral group, such that \u03c1(\u2206b ) is \u2206ob (respectively \u03c1(\u2206r ) is \u2206or ).\nProof . Consider first the icosahedron with its twenty pairwise parallel facets. To each pair of\nparallel facets there correspond two oblate rhombohedra, one the translate of the other, and two\nprolate rhombohedra, also one the translate of the other. Pick one representative for each such\ncouple. This gives a total of ten oblate rhombohedra and ten prolate rhombohedra. Each of the\nten oblate rhombohedra can be mapped to \u2206ob via a transformation of the icosahedral group,\nand in the same way each of the ten prolate rhombohedra can be mapped to \u2206or .\nNow, let C be a vertex of the tiling that is different from 0 and the above vertex B. We can\njoin B to C with a broken line made of subsequent edges of the tiling. We denote the vertices of\nthe broken line thus obtained by T0 = A, T1 = B, . . . , Tj , . . . , Tm = C. Since the tiles are oblate\nand prolate rhombohedra, each vector Yj = Tj \u2212 Tj\u22121 is one of the vectors \u00b1\u03b1k , k = 1, . . . , 6.\nTherefore we have that C \u2212 A = Tm \u2212 T0 = Ym + * * * + Y1 . This implies that the vertex C\nlies in \u03b4P , that each oblate rhombohedron having C as vertex is the translate of one of the ten\noblate rhombohedra described above and that each prolate rhombohedron having C as vertex is\nthe translate of one of the ten prolate rhombohedra described above. We can therefore conclude\nthat, for each oblate rhombohedron \u2206b having C as vertex, there exists a rigid motion \u03c1, given\nby the composition of a translation with a transformation of the icosahedral group, such that\n\u03c1(\u2206b ) = \u2206ob . The same is true for the prolate rhombohedra.\n\u0004\nWe introduce now a quasilattice F \u2282 R3 with respect to which all of the rhombohedra of\nthe tiling are quasirational (cf. Remark 2.1). This is necessary in order to apply the generalized\nDelzant procedure simultaneously to all of the rhombohedra in the tiling. We take F to be the\nquasilattice that is generated by the six vectors\nU1 =\nU4 =\n\n\u221a1 (1, \u03c6 \u2212 1, \u03c6),\n2\n\u221a1 (\u22121, \u03c6 \u2212 1, \u03c6),\n2\n\nU2 =\nU5 =\n\n\u221a1 (\u03c6, 1, \u03c6 \u2212 1),\n2\n\u221a1 (\u03c6, \u22121, \u03c6 \u2212 1),\n2\n\nU3 =\nU6 =\n\n\u221a1 (\u03c6\n2\n\u221a1 (\u03c6\n2\n\nThe quasilattice F is known in physics as the face-centered lattice [9].\n\n\u2212 1, \u03c6, 1),\n\u2212 1, \u03c6, \u22121).\n\n\f6\n\nF.

It can be easily seen that there are exactly 30 vectors\nin F having the same norm. These\n\u221a thirty vectors point to the vertices of an icosidodecahedron\ninscribed in the sphere of radius 2 (see Figs. 5 and 6).\nRemark 3.1. Proposition 3.1 implies that, for each facet of the Ammann tiling, there is a pair\nof vectors {\u03b1i , \u03b1j } such that the given facet is parallel to the plane \u03a0ij generated by {\u03b1i , \u03b1j }.\nWe have 15 such possible pairs {\u03b1i , \u03b1j }, with i, j = 1, . . . , 6, i 6= j. For each one of them, two\nof the 30 vectors above are orthogonal to the corresponding plane \u03a0ij . This ensures that all of\nthe rhombohedra of the tiling are quasirational with respect to F .\n\u0001\u2217\nAnother quasilattice that will be useful in the sequel is the quasilattice I \u2282 R3 that\nis generated by the vectors {2\u03b11 , 2\u03b12 , 2\u03b13 , 2\u03c6\u03b14 , 2\u03c6\u03b15 , 2\u03c6\u03b16 }. The quasilattice I is known in\nphysics as the body centered lattice [9].\nRemark 3.2. The quasilattices P , F and I are invariant under icosahedral symmetries and are\ndense in their respective ambient spaces. One can show that, if we identify R3 with its dual\nusing the standard inner product, we have the following proper inclusions:\nI \u2282 F \u2282 P \u2282 21 I.\n\n(3.2)\n\nUsing the notation of Conway\u2013Sloane [4], the lattices P , F and\nrespective projections from the following lattices in R6 : Z6 ,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n6\n6\n\uf8f2X\n\uf8fd\nX\nD6 = Span\nnj e j\nnj is even ,\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\nand\nD6\u2217 = Span\n\n\uf8f1\n6\n\uf8f21 X\n\uf8f32\n\nnj ej nj \u2261 nk (mod 2)\n\nj=1\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n,\n\n\uf8fe\n\nthe projection being given by\nR6 \u2212\u2192 R3\nej 7\u2212\u2192 \u03b1j .\nCoherently with (3.2) we have the following proper inclusions:\n2D6\u2217 \u2282 D6 \u2282 Z6 \u2282 D6\u2217 .\n\n1\n2I\n\ncan be obtained as the\n\n\fAmmann Tilings in Symplectic Geometry\n\n7\n\nThe lattice Z6 is self dual, whilst D6 and D6\u2217 are the dual of one another. A notion of duality\nfor the icosahedral quasilattices in dimension 3 is derived from the above relations of duality\nin R6 . This is coherent with the symplectic setup. In fact, we will see that the quasilattice F is\nthe group quasilattice (see Remark 4.1) and that the quasilattice 12 I plays the role of its dual,\nthe weight quasilattice (see Section 5).\n\n4\n\nThe tiling from a symplectic viewpoint\n\nIn this section we perform the Delzant construction to obtain symplectic quasifolds that can be\nassociated to the oblate and prolate rhombohedra of an Ammann tiling having edge length \u03c3.\nLet us consider the quasilattice F that we introduced in Section 3. As we have seen, all of\nthe rhombohedra of our tiling are quasirational with respect to F .\nWe begin by considering the oblate rhombohedron \u2206ob which has one of its vertices at the\norigin and is determined by the three non-parallel vectors \u03b4\u03b14 , \u03b4\u03b15 , \u03b4\u03b16 . This simple polytope\nhas 6 facets. For our construction we choose the 6 vectors given by X1 = U1 , X2 = U2 , X3 = U3 ,\nX4 = \u2212U1 , X5 = \u2212U2 and X6 = \u2212U3 . Then the corresponding coefficients are given by\n\u03b4\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = 0 and \u03bb4 = \u03bb5 = \u03bb6 = \u2212 2\u03c6\n. Take now the surjective linear mapping defined by\n\u03c0 : R6 \u2192 R3\nei 7\u2192 Xi .\nIts kernel, n, is the 3-dimensional subspace of R6 that is spanned by e1 + e4 , e2 + e5 and e3 + e6 .\nIt is the Lie algebra of N = {exp(X) \u2208 T 6 | X \u2208 R6 , \u03c0(X) \u2208 F }. If \u03a8b is the moment mapping\nof the induced N -action, then\n\u0001\u2217\n\u03a8b : C6 \u2212\u2192 R3\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\nz 7\u2212\u2192 |z1 |2 + |z4 |2 \u2212 2\u03c6\n, |z2 |2 + |z5 |2 \u2212 2\u03c6\n, |z3 |2 + |z6 |2 \u2212 2\u03c6\n.\n4\n3\n3\n3\n3\nTherefore\n\u03a8\u22121\nb (0) = Sb \u00d7 Sb \u00d7 Sb , where Sb is the sphere in R centered at the origin with radius\nq\n\u03b4\nb = 2\u03c6\n. In order to compute the group N we need the following linear relations between the\ngenerators of the quasilattice F :\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\nU4\n1 \u2212\u03c6 1\nU1\n\uf8edU5 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed 1\n1 \u2212\u03c6\uf8f8 \uf8edU2 \uf8f8 .\nU6\n\u2212\u03c6 1\n1\nU3\n\nThen a straightforward computation gives that\n\b\nN = exp(X) \u2208 T 6 | X = (r + \u03c6h, s + \u03c6k, t + \u03c6l, r, s, t), r, s, t \u2208 R, h, k, l \u2208 Z .\nWe can think of\nS1 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S1 =\n\n\b\n\nexp(X) \u2208 T 6 | X = (r, s, t, r, s, t), r, s, t \u2208 R\n\nas being naturally embedded in N . The quotient group\n\u0393=\n\nS1\n\nN\n\u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S1\n\nis discrete. In conclusion, the symplectic quotient Mb is given by\n\u03a8\u22121\n(0)\nS 3 \u00d7 Sb3 \u00d7 Sb3\nS 2 \u00d7 Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2\nMb = b\n= b\n= b\n,\nN\nN\n\u0393\n\n(4.1)\n\n\f8\n\nF. Battaglia and E. Prato\n\nwhere Sb2 is the sphere in R3 centered at the origin with radius b. The quasitorus D3 = R3 /F\nacts on Mb in a Hamiltonian fashion, with image of the corresponding moment mapping given\nexactly by the oblate rhombohedron \u2206ob .\nConsider now the prolate rhombohedron \u2206or that has one vertex in the origin and is determined by the three nonparallel vectors \u03b4\u03b11 , \u03b4\u03b12 , \u03b4\u03b13 . We now choose the vectors given by\nX1 = U4 , X2 = U5 , X3 = U6 , X4 = \u2212U4 , X5 = \u2212U5 and X6 = \u2212U6 . Then the corresponding\ncoefficients are given by \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = 0 and \u03bb4 = \u03bb5 = \u03bb6 = \u2212 2\u03b4 . It is immediate to check\nthat we obtain the same Lie algebra n as in the case of the oblate rhombohedron. In order to\nsee what happens to the corresponding group we need here the inverse relations:\n\uf8f6\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8eb\n1 1 \u03c61\nU1\nU4\n\uf8f7\n1\n\uf8edU2 \uf8f8 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed \u03c6 1 1 \uf8f8 U5 \uf8f8 .\nU3\nU6\n1 \u03c61 1\nTo write the relations in this form we used the fundamental identity (3.1). This identity also\nimplies that we obtain the same group N as in the case of the oblate rhombohedron.\nThe moment mapping \u03a8r is given by\n\u0001\u2217\n\u03a8r : C6 \u2212\u2192 R3\n\u0001\nz 7\u2212\u2192 |z1 |2 + |z4 |2 \u2212 2\u03b4 , |z2 |2 + |z5 |2 \u2212 2\u03b4 , |z3 |2 + |z6 |2 \u2212 2\u03b4 .\nTherefore\nMr =\n\n\u03a8\u22121\nS 3 \u00d7 Sr3 \u00d7 Sr3\nS 2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2\nr (0)\n= r\n= r\n,\nN\nN\n\u0393\n\nwhere Sr2 \u2282 R3 and Sr3 \u2282 R4 are the spheres centered at the origin with radius r =\nD3\n\nq\n\n\u03b4\n2.\n\nThe\n\n3\n\nquasifold Mr is acted on by the same quasitorus\n= R /F that we obtained for the oblate\nrhombohedron. This action is Hamiltonian and the image of the corresponding moment mapping\nis exactly the prolate rhombohedron \u2206or .\nRemark 4.1. Let us remark that Mb and Mr are both global quotients and that this defines\ntheir quasifold structures. The quasilattice F can be viewed as the group quasilattice of the\nquasitorus D3 acting on both.\nRemark now that, by Proposition 3.1, each of the oblate and prolate rhombohedra in the\ntiling can be obtained from \u2206ob and \u2206or respectively by a transformation of the icosahedral\ngroup composed with a translation. We can then prove the following\nTheorem 4.1. Consider an Ammann tiling having edge length \u03c3. Then the compact connected\nsymplectic quasifold corresponding to each oblate rhombohedron in the tiling is given by Mb ,\nwhile the compact connected symplectic quasifold corresponding to each prolate rhombohedron is\ngiven by Mr .\nProof . Observe that, for each oblate rhombohedron, there exists a transformation T in the\nicosahedral group that leaves the quasilattice F invariant, that sends the orthogonal vectors\nrelative to the chosen oblate rhombohedron to the orthogonal vectors relative to \u2206ob , and such\nthat the dual transformation T \u2217 sends \u2206ob to a translate of the chosen oblate rhombohedron.\nThe same reasoning applies to the prolate rhombohedra of the tiling. This implies that the\nreduced space corresponding to each oblate rhombohedron of the tiling, with the choice of orthogonal vectors and quasilattice specified above, is exactly Mb . This yields a unique symplectic\nquasifold, Mb , for all the oblate rhombohedra in the tiling. In the same way we prove that we\nobtain a unique symplectic quasifold, Mr , for all the prolate rhombohedra in the tiling.\n\u0004\nThe quasifolds Mb and Mr can also be constructed as complex quotients and are K\u00e4hler [1].\n\n\fAmmann Tilings in Symplectic Geometry\n\n5\n\n9\n\nLocal geometry of the quasifolds Mb and Mr\n\nIn this section we study the equivariant geometry of the quasifolds Mb and Mr in a neighborhood\nof the D3 -fixed points.\nLet us begin by describing an atlas for the quasifold Mb . The charts of this atlas are indexed\nby the vertices of the polytope: in our case we find an atlas given by eight charts, each of which\ncorresponds to a vertex of the oblate rhombohedron. Consider for example the origin: it is given\nby the intersection of the facets whose orthogonal vectors are X1 , X2 and X3 . Let Bb be the\nball in C of radius b, namely\nBb = {z \u2208 C | |z| < b}.\nConsider the following mapping, which gives a slice of \u03a8\u22121\nb (0) transversal to the N -orbits\nt1 \b\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2212\u2192\nz \u2208 \u03a8\u22121\nb (0) | z4 6= 0, z5 6= 0, z6 6= 0\n\u0010\n\u0011\np\np\np\n(z1 , z2 , z3 )\n7\u2212\u2192 z1 , z2 , z3 , b2 \u2212 |z1 |2 , b2 \u2212 |z2 |2 , b2 \u2212 |z3 |2 .\n\nThis induces the homeomorphism\n\u03c4\n\n1\n(Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb )/\u03931 \u2212\u2192\nU1\n\n7\u2212\u2192 [t1 (z)],\n\n[z]\n\nwhere the open subset U1 of Mb is the quotient\n\b\nz \u2208 \u03a8\u22121\nb (0) | z4 6= 0, z5 6= 0, z6 6= 0 /N\nand the discrete group \u03931 is given by \u03931 ' N \u2229 (S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 {1} \u00d7 {1} \u00d7 {1}), hence\n\u03931 = exp {(\u03c6h, \u03c6k, \u03c6l) | h, k, l \u2208 Z} .\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe triple (U1 , \u03c41 , (Bb \u00d7Bb \u00d7Bb )/\u03931 ) is a chart of Mb . Analogously, we can construct seven other\ncharts, corresponding to the remaining vertices of the oblate rhombohedron, each of which is\ncharacterized by a different combination of the variables. One can show that these eight charts\nare compatible and give an atlas of Mb .\nOne can check that the moment map, locally, on the first chart is given by\n\u03c6\u03b16\n\u03c6\u03b14\n\u03c6\u03b15\n|z1 |2 +\n|z2 |2 +\n|z3 |2\nh\u03c6\u03b15 , U1 i\nh\u03c6\u03b16 , U2 i\nh\u03c6\u03b14 , U3 i\n= \u03c6\u03b15 |z1 |2 + \u03c6\u03b16 |z2 |2 + \u03c6\u03b14 |z3 |2 ,\n\n\u03a6([z1 : z2 : z3 ]) =\n\nwhile the isotropy action of D3 on C3 /\u03931 is given by\n\u0001\nD3 , C3 /\u03931\n\u2212\u2192 C3 /\u03931\n\u0001\n([X], (z1 , z2 , z3 )) 7\u2212\u2192 e2\u03c0i\u03c6\u03b15 (X) z1 , e2\u03c0i\u03c6\u03b16 (X) z2 , e2\u03c0i\u03c6\u03b14 (X) z3 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nTo obtain the local expression of the moment mapping on the other seven charts it suffices\nto replace \u03c6\u03b15 , \u03c6\u03b16 , \u03c6\u03b14 in (5.2) with all the possible combinations of \u00b1\u03c6\u03b15 , \u00b1\u03c6\u03b16 , \u00b1\u03c6\u03b14\nrespectively.

In conclusion, the weights of the isotropy\naction of the quasitorus D3 on a neighboorhood of the D3 -fixed points for both Mb and Mr\ngenerate the quasilattice 12 I. Therefore 12 I can be thought of, in this setting, as the weight\nquasilattice of D3 . This is consistent with the fact that 12 I is dual to the group quasilattice F\n(cf. Remark 3.2).\nRemark 5.1. Remark that, since \u03b1i (X), \u03c6\u03b1i (X) lie in Z + \u03c6Z whenever X \u2208 F , and since the\nlocal group in each chart of Mb and Mr is equal to \u03931 , the above actions are well defined.\nRemark 5.2.

We obtain\n\b\n\u0001\n1\n1\n1\nVn \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vn = z \u2208 \u03a8\u22121\nb (0) | z4 6= 0, z5 6= 0, z6 6= 0 / S \u00d7 S \u00d7 S\nand\nU1 = (Vn \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vn )/\u0393.\nWe have the following commutative diagram:\n\b\nt1\n/ z \u2208 \u03a8\u22121 (0) | z4 6= 0, z5 6= 0, z6 6= 0\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb\nb\n\u000f\n\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb\np1\n\n\u000f\n\n(Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb )/\u03931\n\n\u03c4\u03031\n\n\u03c41\n\n\u000f\n/ Vn \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vn\n\u000f\n\n(6.1)\n\npb\n\n/ U1 .\n\nThe mapping \u03c4\u03031 is induced by the diagram and can be written as \u03c4n \u00d7 \u03c4n \u00d7 \u03c4n , with \u03c4n : Bb \u2192 Vn .\nObserve that the mapping\nC \u2212\u2192 Vn\np\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\nw 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c4n bw/ 1 + |w|2\n\n\fAmmann Tilings in Symplectic Geometry\n\n11\n\nis just the stereographic projection from the north pole. We denote by \u03c4s the analogous mapping\n\u03c4s : Bb \u2212\u2192 Vs . The two charts (Bb , \u03c4n , Vn ) and (Bb , \u03c4s , Vs ) give a symplectic atlas of Sb2 , whose\nstandard symplectic structure is induced by the standard symplectic structure on Bb . Analogously, at a local level, the symplectic structure of the quotient Mb is induced by the standard\nsymplectic structure on Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb .\nWe have already seen that the quasifold Mb is a global quotient of a product of three 2-spheres\nby the discrete group \u0393. We remark that the atlas above is the quotient by \u0393 of the atlas of the\nproduct of three spheres, given by the eight triples Vn \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vn , Vn \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vs , Vn \u00d7 Vs \u00d7 Vn ,\nVs \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vn , Vn \u00d7 Vs \u00d7 Vs , Vs \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vs , Vs \u00d7 Vs \u00d7 Vn , Vs \u00d7 Vs \u00d7 Vs .\nWe are now ready to prove Theorem 6.1:\nProof . Let us begin by showing that Mb and Mr are diffeomorphic. Let us denote by pr the\nprojection\nSr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u2192 Mr .\nThe natural \u0393-equivariant diffeomorphism f \u2020 : Sb2 \u00d7Sb2 \u00d7Sb2 \u2192 Sr2 \u00d7Sr2 \u00d7Sr2 induces a homeomorphism f : Mb \u2192 Mr ; in general, a homeomorphism between two global quotients that is induced\nby an equivariant diffeomorphism of the manifolds turns out to be a quasifold diffeomorphism [3,\nDefinition A.2].\nLet us now show that Mb and Mr are not symplectomorphic. Denote by \u03c9b and \u03c9r the\nsymplectic forms of Mb and Mr respectively. Suppose that there is a symplectomorphism\nh : Mb \u2212\u2192 Mr , namely a diffeomorphism h such that h\u2217 (\u03c9r ) = \u03c9b . We prove that this implies that the homeomorphism h : Mb \u2192 Mr lifts to a symplectomorphism h\u0303 : Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2 \u2192\nSr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 , leading thus to a contradiction: such symplectomorphism cannot exists, since\nthe two manifolds have different symplectic volumes. To start with recall from [3, Remark 2.9]\nthat, to each point m \u2208 Mb , one can associate the groups \u0393m and \u0393h(m) . The definition\nof diffeomorphism implies that these two groups are isomorphic. Let nb \u2208 Sb2 be the north\npole and take m0 = pb (nb \u00d7 nb \u00d7 nb ). Then, since \u0393m ' \u0393h(m) , without loss of generality the point h(m0 ) can be taken to be pr (nr \u00d7 nr \u00d7 nr ), where nr \u2208 Sr2 is the north pole.\nConsider the chart U1 that we constructed above. Then, by definition of quasifold diffeomorphism [3, Definition A.23] and [3, Remark A.24], there exists an open subset U \u2282 U1\nsuch that m0 \u2208 U and h \u25e6 \u03c41\u22121 : \u03c41\u22121 (U ) \u2192 h(U ) is a diffeomorphism of the universal covering models induced by \u03c41\u22121 (U ) \u2282 Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb /\u03931 and h(U ) \u2282 Mr respectively. Moreover, by [3, Proposition A.9], any open subset W \u2282 U enjoys the same property. We can\nchoose W0 \u2282 U1 such that W\u03030 = (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (W0 )) is a product of three balls. In particular, W\u03030 is simply connected. Denote now by W\u0303r,0 = (pr )\u22121 (h(W ))); this is an open subset\nof Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 , which is also connected, due to the action of \u0393 on Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 . Denote\n]\nby Wr,0\nits universal covering. Now consider a point z 1 \u2208 Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb such that z11 6= 0,\nz21 6= 0 and z31 6= 0 and let m = (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )(z 1 ). For the sequel it is crucial to remark that,\nbecause of the action of \u03931 given in (5.1), any \u03931 -invariant open subset of Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb that\ncontains the point z 1 , contains also the product of circles {(z1 , z2 , z3 ) \u2208 Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb | |z1 | =\n|z11 |, |z2 | = |z12 |, |z3 | = |z13 |}. Hence, for each point (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )(tz 1 ) with t \u2208 [0, 1], we can find\nan open subset Wt \u2282 U1 , containing that point, such that the homeomorphism \u03c41\u22121 \u25e6 h, restricted to \u03c41\u22121 (Wt ), is a diffeomorphism, and (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (Wt ) is the product of three open\nannuli. We can cover the curve by a finite number of these Wt 's: W0 , W1 , . . . , Ws , with\nWj \u2229 Wj+1 6= \u2205. Notice that (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (Wj \u2229 Wj+1 ), j = 0, . . . , s \u2212 1, is itself a product\nof three open annuli. The subsets W\u0303j = (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (Wj ) and W\u0303r,j = (pr )\u22121 (h(Wj )) are open and\nconnected.\nWe divide the remaining part of the proof in subsequent steps:\n\n\f12\n\nF. Battaglia and E. Prato\n\nStep 1: consider first W0 . Since the isotropy of \u03931 at 0 is the whole \u03931 , we can apply [3,\nLemma 6.2]. We find that W\u0303r,0 is itself simply connected and that the homeomorphism h \u25e6 \u03c41\nlifts to a diffeomorphism h \u03030 : W\u03030 \u2192 W\u0303r,0 .\nStep 2: consider the homeomorphism h1 = h \u25e6 \u03c41 defined on \u03c41\u22121 (W1 ). By construction h1 is\na diffeomorphism of the universal covering models of the induced models. We find the following\ndiagram:\nh]1\n\nW1]\n\u03c01\n\n/ W]\nr,1\n\u03c11\n\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\nW\u03031\n\nW\u0303r,1\n\np1\n\nq1\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03c41\u22121 (W1 )\n\nh1\n\n\u000f\n\n/ h(W1 ).\n\nConsider the restriction of h1 to \u03c41\u22121 (W0 \u2229 W1 ). This restriction admits a lift, given by the\nrestriction of h]1 to (\u03c01 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (\u03c41\u22121 (W0 \u2229 W1 )). Furthermore, by Step 1, the restriction of h1 ad\u22121\nmits another lift, defined on p\u22121\n1 (\u03c41 (W0 \u2229 W1 )), which is the restriction of h\u03030 . Therefore, by [3,\nLemma 6.3], the restriction of \u03c11 \u25e6 h]1 to (\u03c01 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (\u03c41\u22121 (W0 \u2229 W1 )) descends to a diffeomorphism\n\u22121\ndefined on p\u22121\n1 (\u03c41 (W0 \u2229 W1 )).\nStep 3: we consider W0 \u2229W1 \u2282 W1 and we apply [3, Lemma 6.5] to the homeomorphism h\u25e6\u03c41\ndefined on \u03c41\u22121 (W1 ). We deduce that h \u25e6 \u03c41 is a diffeomorphism of the model (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 (W1 )/\u03931\nwith the model induced by h(W1 ) \u2282 Mr .\nStep 4: we apply Step 3 to the other successive intersections. We find that h \u25e6 \u03c41 is a diffeok\n\nk\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\nmorphism of the model (\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 ( \u222a Wi )/\u03931 with the model induced by h( \u222a Wi ) \u2282 Mr .\nRemark now that a slight modification of the above argument applies to any choice of point\nz 1 \u2208 Bb \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 Bb , z 1 6= 0.\nLet \u000f > 0 be arbitrarily small. Consider the product of closed balls B b\u2212\u000f \u00d7 B b\u2212\u000f \u00d7 B b\u2212\u000f .\nThis, by Step 4, can be covered by a finite number of connected open subsets of the kind\nk\n\n(\u03c41 \u25e6 p1 )\u22121 ( \u222a Wi )/\u03931 , whose intersection is a product of three balls centered at the origin.\ni=1\n\nNow [3, Lemma A.3], which guarantees the uniqueness of the lift up to the action of \u0393, implies\nthat the homeomorphism h admits a lift to \u03c4\u03031 (B b\u2212\u000f \u00d7 B b\u2212\u000f \u00d7 B b\u2212\u000f ). This in turn implies that\nh : U1 \u2192 h(U1 ) admits a lift\nh\u03031 : Vn \u00d7 Vn \u00d7 Vn \u2192 p\u22121\nr (h(U1 )).\nWe apply the same argument to the other eight charts. These charts intersect on the dense\nconnected open subset where the action of the quasitorus D3 is free. By the uniqueness of\nthe lift [3, Lemma A.3], we obtain a global lift h\u0303 : Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2 \u2192 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 . Moreover,\nsince diagram (6.1) preserves the symplectic structures, we have that h\u0303 is a symplectomorphism\nbetween Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2 \u00d7 Sb2 to Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 \u00d7 Sr2 , which is impossible.\n\u0004\nIn conclusion, similarly to what happens in dimension two for Penrose rhombus tilings [2],\nthere is a unique quasifold structure that is naturally associated to any Ammann tiling with\nfixed edge length, and two distinct symplectic structures that distinguish the oblate and the\nprolate rhombohedra.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Ron Lifshitz for his help on the theory of quasicrystals.\n\n\fAmmann Tilings in Symplectic Geometry\n\n13\n\nReferences\n[1] Battaglia F., Prato E., Generalized toric varieties for simple nonrational convex polytopes, Int.
