By use of a wave function in phase\nspace both can be treated in the same quantum formalism. The different dynamics of quantum and\nclassical particles resides then only from different evolution equations for the probability distribution. Quantum particles are characterized by a specific choice of observables and time evolution of\nthe probability density. All relations for a quantum particle in a potential, including interference\nand tunneling, can be described in terms of the classical probability distribution. We formulate\nthe concept of zwitters - particles for which the time evolution interpolates between quantum and\nclassical particles. Experiments can test a small parameter which quantifies possible deviations from\nquantum mechanics.\n\nQuantum particles can be described by classical statistics [1]. This may be viewed as a generalization of the\nembedding of quantum statistics in classical statistics [2]\nfor the limit of infinitely many states or observables with\ncontinuous spectrum. On the other hand, the quantum formalism can be used for classical particles by introducing a\nreal classical wave function in phase space [1]. The conceptual unification of quantum and classical particles permits\na continuous interpolation between both ends. Zwitters\nare particles whose behavior is neither completely quantum\nnor completely classical. Experimental tests have to quantify how well quantum mechanics is obeyed by establishing\nbounds on a small parameter for possible deviations.\nFor zwitters the deviations from quantum mechanics are\nnot related to the classical limit. They can occur for typical\nangular momenta or products of energy and time intervals\n\u2206E\u2206t of the order ~. The classical limit of large \u2206E\u2206t/~\nis common to quantum particles, zwitters and classical particles. On the other hand, zwitters may correspond to an\neffective one-particle description of macroscopic objects as\ndroplets of a liquid, as realized in interesting experimental\nsettings [3]. In this case the effective value of ~ can be much\nlarger than the value in quantum mechanics. We concentrate in this note on a description in terms of the probability distribution w(x, p) in phase space. This is the minimal\ncommon ground for a statistical description of both quantum and classical particles. More general settings for a\nunified discussion of quantum and classical particles will\nbe discussed at the end of this note.\nThe description of quantum particles by classical probabilities may at first sight look surprising, since it seems\nto violate several theorems. We argue that both for classical statistics and quantum physics the outcome of several sequential or simultaneous measurements should be\npredicted by conditional correlation functions. Those can\nviolate Bell's inequalities [4], in contrast to classical correlation functions [5]. Actually, classical correlations are not\ndefined for the observables which describe position and momentum for quantum particles - we deal with incomplete\nstatistics [6]. Contradictions with the Kochen-Specker theorem [7] are avoided [2] by the appearance of equivalence\nclasses of classical observables and by probabilistic observ-\n\nables [2], [8]. In the present note the demonstration that\nno inconsistencies arise is simple: we explicitly construct\nall correlation functions for a quantum particle, including\ntheir time evolution, in terms of a classical probability distribution. Quantum particles are distinguished from classical particles by the use of different observables, and by a\ndifferent time evolution of the probability density. For different connections between quantum and classical aspects\nsee refs. [9], [10].\nClassical particles in quantum formalism\nOur starting point is the probability distribution in\nphase space, w(z, p), for a classical particle. It obeys the\nusual rules for classical probabilities\nZ\nw(z, p) = 1.\n(1)\nw(z, p) \u2265 0 ,\nz,p\n\n(We use z = d3 z, p = d3 p/(2\u03c0~)3 .) The expectation\nvalues for arbitrary functions F (z, p) of the classical position z and momentum p obtain as\nZ\nF (z, p)w(z, p).\n(2)\nhF (z, p)i =\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nR\n\nz,p\n\nFor a particle in a potential V (z) the classical time evolution of w obeys the Liouville equation\n\u2202\np \u2202\n\u2202V \u2202\nw = \u2212L\u0302w , L\u0302 =\n\u2212\n.\n\u2202t\nm \u2202z\n\u2202z \u2202p\n\n(3)\n\n(Scalar products between vectors are always assumed.)\nBy modifying the evolution equation and introducing new\ntypes of position and momentum observables we will see\nthat the probability density (1) can describe all aspects of\na quantum particle.\nIt is useful to recast the probabilistic description of a\nparticle into the quantum formalism, which can be used for\nclassical and quantum particles as well as zwitters. An important concept is the real classical wave function \u03c8C (z, p),\nobeying\n2\nw = \u03c8C\n.\n\n(4)\n\n\f2\nThis resembles the Hilbert space formulation \u221a\nof classical\nmechanics by Koopman [11]. However, \u03c8C = s w is here\na real function which is computable from w. The sign function s = \u00b11 is essentially fixed by continuity properties [1].\nThe classical time evolution of \u03c8C follows from a type of\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation equivalent to eq. (3),\n\nIn terms of \u03c1\u0304w the totally symmetrized products of quantum observables obey a relation similar to eq. (2)\nZ\nhF (XQ , PQ )i =\nF (z, p)\u03c1\u0304w (z, p).\n(11)\nz,p\n\nThe order of operators now matters. We postulate that\nthe outcome of measurements of XQ and PQ is related to\nhF (XQ , PQ )i by the standard rule of the quantum formalism. For example, the dispersion of a position measurement\n2\nis \u22062x = hXQ\ni \u2212 hXQ i2 . This postulate can ultimately be\nderived from a \"microphysical ensemble\" where XQ and PQ\nappear as classical observables with definite values for every state [1, 2]. Eq. (9) finds a non-linear expression [1] in\nterms of the probability density w(z, p) and its derivatives\nwith respect to z and p, such that no information beyond\nw(z, p) is needed for the computation of hF (XQ , PQ )i.\nOne can introduce the \"quantum transform\" of the probability density w(z, p) by employing the classical wave function \u03c8C ,\n\nHowever, \u03c1\u0304w can now be negative in certain regions of\nphase space and is therefore no longer a classical probability density. Eq. (11) can also be interpreted as the\nquantum rule for the symmetrized correlation functions of\na quantum particle whose state can be fully characterized\nby a Wigner function [12, 13] \u03c1\u0304w (z, p).\nOne may therefore ask if each possible Wigner function\nfor a quantum particle can be obtained as a quantum transform of a suitable positive definite classical probability distribution in phase space w(z, p). The answer is affirmative.\nIt has been shown by explicit construction [1] that for arbitrary quantum states one can find one or several classical probability distributions w(z, p) such that the quantum\ntransform (10) yields \u03c1\u0304w (z, p). This constitutes an explicit\nconstruction of a classical probability density from which\nthe expectation values for quantum observables (7) can be\ncomputed according to eq. (9), such that they coincide\nwith the ones for a quantum particle (11) in a state given\nby the Wigner transform of the density matrix that can be\nassociated to a classical wave function by eq. (10).\nAt this stage the time evolution of the probability distribution is still given by the Liouville equation for classical\nparticles. It differs from the time evolution of a quantum\nparticle, showing, for example, a different interference pattern in a double slit experiment. Nevertheless, we have now\nat our disposal two sets of observables for possible measurements of position and momentum: There are first the\nclassical observables Xcl and Pcl , with the function w(z, p)\ndetermining expectation values according to eq. (2). Second, for the non-commuting quantum observables XQ and\nPQ the expectation values can be computed in a similar\nfashion (11), but now with the quantum transform \u03c1\u0304w (z, p)\ninstead of w(z, p). It is not clear a priori which set of observables yields a better description of measurements of\nposition and momentum of classical particles. Real measurements of classical particles are typically performed in\nthe classical limit of large \u2206E\u2206t/~ (or similar for some\nother relevant quantity). If ~-effects can be neglected, the\nquantum and classical observables for position and momentum coincide, cf. eq. (7). Concerning their conceptual\nstatus the observables XQ and PQ can be associated with\n\"weak observables\" [14] for which measurement prescriptions have been discussed. Such non-commuting observable structures are fully compatible with a classical time\nevolution equation for the probability density. In order to\nhave the analogy between classical and quantum particles\nas close as possible we will in the following use the quantum\nobservables XQ and PQ also for classical particles. Other\nchoices, including an interpolation between classical and\nquantum observables, are discussed in ref. [1].\n\n\u03c1\u0304w (z, p) =\n(10)\nZ\n\u2032\nr\nr\u2032\ns\nr\n\u2212\nsr\u2032\n\u03c8C (z + , p + s)\u03c8C (z + , p + s\u2032 ) cos\n.\n2\n2\n~\nr,r \u2032 ,s,s\u2032\n\nQuantum evolution\nOur second step modifies the classical time evolution\nof the probability density (3) by a new fundamental non-\n\n\u2202\ni~ \u03c8C = HL \u03c8C ,\n\u2202t\nHL = \u2212i~L\u0302 = \u2212i~\n\n\u2202V \u2202\np \u2202\n+ i~\n.\nm \u2202z\n\u2202z \u2202p\n\n(5)\n\nWe can now employ the usual formalism of quantum mechanics by choosing commuting operators Xcl and Pcl for\nclassical position and momentum.

All predictions for expectation values (11) and their time evolution\nare therefore identical to quantum mechanics. This establishes that quantum particles in an arbitrary potential can\nbe described in terms of a classical probability distribution\nin phase space. For a suitable choice of w at some initial\ntime t0 the time evolution is such that the quantum interference pattern in a double slit experiment arises if the\nmeasurements of the location of the particle correspond to\nthe quantum observable XQ . The probability of Rfinding the\nparticle at the quantum position z is given by p \u03c1\u0304w (z, p),\nwhile for the classical position \u03c1\u0304w is replaced by w. We conclude that for a suitable choice of evolution equation (12)\nand observables (7) a \"classical\" positive definite probability distribution in phase space can describe all aspects of\nthe dynamics of a quantum particle.\nIn particular, pure quantum states are accounted for by\nclassical probability distributions obeying the factorization\nproperty\nZ\n\u2032\neip(r \u2212r)/~\n(15)\nw(z, p) =\nr,r \u2032\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0010\n\u0010\nr\u2032\nr\u0011\nr\u2032\nr\u0011\n\u2217\n\u2217\nz+\n\u03c8Q\nz\u2212\n\u03c8Q z \u2212\n\u03c8Q\n\u03c8Q z +\n.\n2\n2\n2\n2\nHere \u03c8Q (x) is the usual complex Schr\u00f6dinger wave function\nfor the quantum particle, obeying the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ni~\n\n~2\n\u2202\n\u03c8Q (x) = HQ \u03c8Q (x) , HQ = \u2212\n\u2206 + V (x).\n\u2202t\n2m\n\n(16)\n\nFor pure quantum states the classical wave function equals\nthe Wigner-transform of the quantum density matrix\n\u2217\n\u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ) = \u03c8Q (x)\u03c8Q\n(x\u2032 ), i.e. \u03c8C (z, p) = \u03c1\u0304w (z, p).

We may\nchange the basis for the classical wave function by a Fourier\ntransform with respect to p,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nx+y\nip(x\u2212y)/~\n,p ,\n(17)\n\u03c8C\n\u03c8\u0303C (x, y) = e\n2\np\nand introduce the \"classical density matrix\"\n\u2217\n\u03c1C (x, x\u2032 , y, y \u2032 ) = \u03c8\u0303C (x, y)\u03c8\u0303C\n(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ).\n\n(18)\n\nWe observe that the Fourier transforms \u03c8\u0303C and \u03c1C are\nnon longer real. The classical density matrix is defined for\narbitrary classical wave functions \u03c8C (z, p) or probability\ndistributions w(z, p).\nThe quantum density matrix obtains by \"integrating\nout\" the y-coordinate or \"performing a subtrace\"\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c1Q (x, x ) = \u03c1C (x, x\u2032 , y, y).\n(19)\ny\n\nOne may verify [1] that \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ) obeys all the formal criteria for a density matrix in quantum mechanics. The\nWigner transform of the \"coarse grained density matrix\"\n\u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ), with z = (x + x\u2032 )/2,\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c1\u0304w (z, p) = d3 (x \u2212 x\u2032 )e\u2212ip(x\u2212x )/~ \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ),\n(20)\nequals the quantum transform in eq. (10). The coarse\ngrained density matrix \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ) obeys all laws for the\nquantum density matrix if we choose the time evolution\n(13). Insertion of this time evolution in the definition (18),\n(19) yields\ni~\u2202t \u03c1Q = [HQ , \u03c1Q ],\n\n(21)\n\nwith HQ given by eq. (16). This is the quantum time evolution of the density matrix associated to the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation. Eq. (14) for the Wigner transform can be obtained from eq. (21) by a Fourier transform.\nThe density matrix for a pure quantum state obeys the\nusual condition \u03c12Q = \u03c1Q . For this particular case one finds\n\u03c1\u0304w (z, p) = \u03c8C (z, p). (This relation does not hold for mixed\nstates.) For pure states one can compute the quantum wave\nfunction \u03c8Q (x) from the quantum density matrix \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 )\nand therefore from \u03c1\u0304w (z, p). In consequence, both the modulus and the phase of the complex quantum wave function\ncan be computed from the real classical wave function and\nthus from the probability distribution.\nAll the information necessary for the computation of expectation values of quantum observables and their quantum correlations is still available on the coarse grained\nlevel. (In the (x, y)-representation one has XQ = x, PQ =\n\n\f4\n\u2212i~\u2202x .) In contrast, information necessary for the expectation values of classical observables and classical correlations may be lost by the coarse graining - the expectation values (6) cannot be expressed in terms of \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 )\nor \u03c1\u0304w (z, p) alone. An exception are pure quantum states\nfor which the expectation values and correlations for classical observables are uniquely determined by the quantum\ndensity matrix [1].\nZwitters\nThe concept of zwitters arises from the possibility to interpolate between the quantum and classical Hamiltonians\nHW and HL . One of the many possible interpolations considers a time evolution of \u03c8C with zwitter-Hamiltonian H\u03b3\nH\u03b3 = cos2 \u03b3HW + sin2 \u03b3HL .\n\n(22)\n\nThe quantum particle obtains for \u03b3 = 0, while the classical\nparticle is described by the other limit \u03b3 = \u03c0/2. Zwitters obtain for intermediate values of \u03b3. The consistent\ndefinition of zwitters constitutes perhaps the most striking\nevidence that there is no conceptual jump between quantum and classical particles. We have no particular motivation for the specific interpolation (22) - zwitters can be\ndefined in a much wider context by Hamiltonians that neither equal HL nor HW . We stick to the specific form (22)\nonly in order to discuss a concrete example.\nIn a wider perspective, zwitters could be realized by an\neffective one-particle description of macroscopic bodies or\ncollective states. For example, the dynamics of droplets of\na liquid may be described in some approximation by the\ntime evolution of a probability density in phase space that\ndoes not correspond to a classical point particle. Recent\nexperiments [3] point in this direction. Other interesting\ncandidates are collective quantum states as a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate. We will turn back to this issue at the end of\nthis note.\nThe description of a particle is consistent for arbitrary\nvalues of \u03b3. It becomes therefore an experimental issue to\nquantify how well quantum mechanics is obeyed by putting\nlimits on \u03b3. For example, nonzero \u03b3 will modify atomic\nspectra and the interference pattern in a double slit experiment. For single well isolated atoms we expect strong\nbounds on \u03b3. The situation is less obvious if a large number of atoms is described by a single wave function for a\n\"collective particle\", as for the case of a Bose-Einstein condensate. In this case it is conceivable that nonzero \u03b3 can be\nfound for an effective description. We do not expect \u03b3 to be\na universal number. This parameter may rather depend on\nthe given setting for which the notion of an isolated particle\nis realized. Nevertheless, the best experimental bounds on\n\u03b3 can also be interpreted as fundamental tests of quantum\nmechanics by limiting possible deviations in a quantitative\nway.\nEven if the world is described by perfect quantum mechanics, a lack of complete isolation or coherence may be\naccounted for by nonzero \u03b3. The unitary time evolution of\nquantum mechanics is guaranteed only for \u03b3 = 0. In contrast, the evolution of the classical wave function remains\nunitary for arbitrary \u03b3. For \u03b3 6= 0 the coarse graining may\n\nviolate the unitarity of the time evolution of the coarse\ngrained density matrix (19) and account for phenomena\nas decoherence [15], or the opposite syncoherence [2], and\nan increasing or decreasing effective entropy for the coarse\ngrained subsystem.\nIf a fundamental many body theory obeys exact quantum mechanics, the issue of a possible observation of zwitters concerns the amount of information that is necessary\nfor the description of an \"isolated one particle state\". The\nnotion of an isolated one particle state means that no information beyond the probability distribution w(z, p) or the\nassociated classical wave function \u03c8C (z, p) is available and\nneeded for a complete description of the state. (There are\neasy generalizations for particles with internal degrees of\nfreedom.) For quantum particles this information can be\nreduced to the information contained in the quantum density matrix \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ). The generalized Hamiltonian HW\nallows for a consistent evolution equation which does not\nuse information beyond \u03c1Q . If additional information, contained in \u03c8C (z, p) but not in \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ), is available and relevant for the time evolution of the isolated particle, more\ngeneral evolution equations as the one for zwitters become\npossible. In this perspective the issue of zwitters concerns\nthe question what type of isolated one-particle states can be\nrealized in a quantum many body theory. The time evolution of zwitters is unitary if the information in the classical\nwave function \u03c8C (z, p) is available, but no longer unitary\nwith respect to the coarse grained information contained in\n\u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ). In this respect zwitters are distinguished from\nmore general effects of imperfect isolation. While the isolation is not perfect in the quantum sense that information is\nneeded beyond \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ), it is still realized in the classical\nsense that a single particle probability distribution w(z, p)\nis sufficient for the isolated subsystem.\nWe next address characteristic features of zwitters that\ncan be tested by observation. (Cf. the second ref.\n[1] for more details.) For a quantum particle one has\n[HQ , HW ] = 0 such that HQ = PQ2 /2m + V (XQ ) plays the\nrole of a conserved energy, similar to the classical energy\nHcl = Pcl2 /2m+V (Xcl ) which commutes with HL . No such\nconserved energy is available for zwitters for \u03b3 6= 0, \u03c0/2.\n(The generator of time translations is H\u03b3 which vanishes\nfor all static states.) This observation may serve for establishing experimental bounds on \u03b3. Indeed, a typical ground\nstate for a zwitter has no sharp energy but rather a nonzero\nwidth. In turn, eigenstates of the quantum energy HQ are\nnot static since [HQ , H\u03b3 ] 6= 0 (except for harmonic V ). Let\nus assume from now on that position, momentum and energy for zwitters are measured by the quantum observables\nXQ , PQ and HQ , such that the only difference to a quantum particle arises through the modified time evolution for\n\u03b3 6= 0.\nA good candidate for the ground state of a zwitter is\na probability distribution which leads to a static coarse\ngrained density matrix \u03c1Q (x, x\u2032 ). Among these \"coarse\ngrained static states\" we consider the one with lowest hHQ i.\nFor small \u03b3 it is approximately given by a pure quan(\u03b3)\ntum state \u03c80 (x). This wave function is dominated by\nthe quantum ground state \u03c80 , but has small admixtures\n\n\f5\n\u223c sin2 \u03b3 of higher energy eigenstates \u03c8n (HQ \u03c8n = En \u03c8n ).\nWe find a nonzero energy width for the zwitter ground\nstate\n2\n\u2206E = (hHQ\ni \u2212 hHQ i2 )1/2 = f1 sin2 \u03b3|E0 |,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the calculable constant f1 depends on the potential.\n(For a Coulomb potential one has 2 < f1 < 10.) Also the\nmean energy of the ground state increases for \u03b3 > 0\nhHQ i = E0 + \u03b4E (\u03b3) , \u03b4E (\u03b3) = f2 sin2 \u03b3\u2206E.\n\n(24)\n\nHowever, this shift (0.5 \u2264 f2 \u2264 2.5 for a Coulomb potential) is much smaller than the width \u2206E. The nonzero\nwidth \u2206E of the ground state contrasts with the quantum particle. Measurements of \u2206E may therefore determine \u03b3 or yield bounds. As an example, one may extract\n\u2206E < 0.6 * 10\u221220 eV from the relaxation time of nuclear\npolarized 3 He [16], and estimate by comparison with the\nbinding energy |\u03b3| . 3 * 10\u221214 . (A more detailed calculation of the system with a zwitter Hamiltonian would be\nnecessary in order to extract a precise bound.) A particularly interesting situation arises if the first excited quantum\nstate is very close to the quantum ground state such that\n\u2206E and E1 \u2212 E0 are of comparable order.\nFor small \u03b3 we may use in eq. (22) cos2 \u03b3 = 1, sin2 \u03b3 =\n2\n\u03b3 = \u01eb. More general zwitter Hamiltonians for small deviations from quantum mechanics can be obtained by\nH\u01eb = HW + \u01ebH\u2206 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwith H\u2206 involving z, p as well as derivatives \u2202z , \u2202p . For a\nconsistent time evolution of the classical wave function H\u2206\nmust be hermitean and purely imaginary, such that L\u2206 =\n(i/~)H\u2206 adds to the antisymmetric generator of rotations,\nLW + \u01ebL\u2206.\nConceptual issues of quantum mechanics\nHaving derived all features of standard quantum mechanics (for \u03b3 = 0) from a classical probability distribution in phase space, a few thoughts about conceptual issues may be in order. Since all correlation functions for\nthe quantum observables XQ and PQ follow the quantum\nrules, there is no doubt that measurements should yield\nthe values predicted by quantum mechanics if we use the\nsame correspondence between the distribution of measurement values and correlation functions. In a sequence of\ntwo measurements for observables A and B the appropriate conditional correlation function hBAim multiplies first\nthe possible measurement value A\u03b1 with the probability\nw\u03b1 for the states for which the observable A has the value\nA\u03b1 . This is then multiplied with the possible measurement\nvalue B\u03b2 and the conditional probability (w\u03b2 |\u03b1) to find a\nvalue B\u03b2 if A\u03b1 has been found in the first measurement.\nOne finally sums over all \u03b1 and \u03b2\nX\nhBAim =\nA\u03b1 B\u03b2 (w\u03b2 |\u03b1)w\u03b1 .\n(26)\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nWe have advocated that this correlation function is given\nby the anticommutator of the associated quantum operators \u00c2, B\u0302 [2],\nhBAim =\n\n1\nh{\u00c2, B\u0302}i.\n2\n\n(27)\n\nWhile two measurements commute, the order matters for a\ngeneralization to three measurements [2]. The conditional\ncorrelations (26) can violate Bell's inequalities [2]. In contrast, Bell's inequalities would follow if we would replace in\neq. (26) the conditional probability (w\u03b2 |\u03b1)w\u03b1 by the joint\nprobability w\u03b2\u03b1 of finding B\u03b2 and A\u03b1 in a given state of\nthe ensemble. Joint probabilities for XQ and PQ are not\ndefined in terms of w or \u03c1\u0304w , however.\nWe emphasize that we have obtained quantum mechanics from the concept of a classical statistical ensemble, but\nnot from a deterministic theory based on trajectories. Indeed, Newtonian trajectories would lead to the Liouville\nequation and not be compatible with the time evolution\n(12). Our basic setting is probabilistic realism. There is\none reality, but only a probabilistic description is possible\nand meaningful. Physics describes conditional probabilities for sequences of events. In the presence of correlations\na system cannot be divided into independent subsystems the whole is more than the sum of its parts. This also holds\nfor non-local correlations between regions that cannot exchange light signals. Non-local correlations are common in\nstatistical physics, a good example being the anisotropies in\nthe cosmic microwave background. A causal theory only\nrequires that non-local correlations have been generated\nby causal events in the past. No paradoxon arises in the\nEinstein-Rosen-Podolski setting [17] if one limits the discussion to these probabilistic concepts [2]. There is no\ncontradiction to realism and causality if correlations are\naccepted as genuine part of reality.\nA further conceptual point may become apparent if we\nexpress the expectation value of the squared quantum momentum in terms of the probability density\nhPQ2 i = hPcl2 i +\n\n~2\nh(\u2202z ln w)2 i.\n16\n\n(28)\n\nThe second contribution is of statistical nature, similar to\nquantities like the entropy in an equilibrium ensemble. It\ninvolves a phase space integral over (\u2202z w)2 /w and is therefore not linear in w, as opposed to the expectation values of classical observables. In a sense, the second part\nmeasures the \"roughness\" of the distribution in position\n2\nspace. Together with a similar contribution in hXQ\ni for\nthe roughness in momentum space, this is responsible for\nHeisenberg's uncertainty relation.\nWhile an understanding of several important conceptual\nissues of quantum mechanics is possible within our description in terms of a probability density w(z, p) in phase space,\nthis does not hold for all of them. In particular, particlewave duality is not addressed in this limited setting. In\nquantum mechanics \"interval observables\" are defined by\nfunctions\n\u001a\n1 for x \u2208 R\n,\n(29)\nJR (x\u0304) =\n0 otherwise\nwith R some region of space (interval) around x\u0304. The expectation value is simply given by\nZ\nZ\nhJR (x\u0304)i =\n\u03c8 \u2217 (x)JR (x\u0304)\u03c8(x) =\n\u03c8 \u2217 (x)\u03c8(x), (30)\nV\n\nR\n\n\f6\nR\nR\nwhere the integrals V and R are space integrals over the\nwhole volume V or the region R, respectively. Since JR (x\u0304)\n2\nis a projector, JR\n(x\u0304) = JR (x\u0304), its spectrum consists of the\nvalues zero and one. According to the rules of quantum\nmechanics the possible measurement values of such interval observables are only zero or one. This has a simple\ninterpretation: either the particle is present in the region\naround x\u0304, yielding JR (x\u0304) = 1, or it is somewhere else, with\nJR (x\u0304) = 0. This discreteness of particles, together with a\ncontinuous probability distribution describing how likely it\nis to find the particle in the region around x\u0304, constitutes\nthe essence of particle-wave duality.\nNo sign of the discrete particle properties is visible in\nthe description by w(z, p). We can implement the interval\nobservables JR (x\u0304) in our classical statistical setting. Their\nexpectation values will indeed obey the quantum formula\n(30). However, in order to account for the restricted spectrum of possible measurement values zero or one we have to\nassociate JR (x\u0304) with probabilistic observables as discussed\nin ref. [2]. Typically, probabilistic observables arise from a\nclassical statistical ensemble with a larger number of \"substates\", for which part of the information is already integrated out on the level of the one-particle probability\ndistribution w(z, p).\nIn fact, a full description of quantum particles by classical statistics involves two crucial aspects. First, one needs\nto obtain the dynamics of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation from\nan evolution equation of a classical probability density or\nassociated classical wave function. This is achieved in the\npresent note. Second, one needs a formulation in terms of\nclassical states for which the observables can only take the\nvalues allowed by quantum mechanics. In the present note\nthis poses no problem for the continuous observables position and momentum, since they can assume arbitrary real\nvalues. For a realization of the interval observables JR (x\u0304)\none needs, however, to consider some \"underlying level\",\nas sketched, in principle, in the first ref. [1].\nObtaining the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in a classical statistical setting (without implementing the discrete particle\naspects) can be achieved in a wide variety of settings. As a\nsimple example, one can derive the Schr\u00f6dinger equation as\na classical field equation from the Klein-Gordon equation\nin an external electromagnetic field,\n(\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd D\u03bc D\u03bd \u2212 m2 )\u03c6 = 0,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u22020 = \u2202t (we use c = 1), \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd = diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1), and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c61\n0 , \u22121\n\u03c6=\n.\n, D\u03bc \u03c6 = (\u2202\u03bc + eA\u03bc I)\u03c6 , I =\n\u03c62\n1 , 0\n(32)\nFor a simple demonstration that the phases of quantum\nmechanics arise from the presence of a complex structure\nin a real formulation we employ here two real fields \u03c61,2 .\nThe usual complex Klein-Gordon equation obtains for the\ncomplex scalar field \u03c6 = \u03c61 + i\u03c62 . The form of the KleinGordon equation is determined by Lorentz-symmetry and\nthe number of derivatives. It is a classical field equation\nwith the same status as Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. As is well known, the non-relativistic ap-\n\nproximation yields the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a particle with mass M = ~m in a potential V (x) = e~A0 (x).\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger wave function \u03c8(x) is defined as \u03c8(x) =\nexp(\u2212imt)\u03c6(x). One observes the appearance of ~ as pure\nconversion factor for units of mass and charge. The interpretation of quantum mechanics as a classical system in ref.\n[9] corresponds to this picture of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nas a classical field equation.\nOne could build a classical statistical description on the\nclassical\n\u03c6\u0303i (x), with probability distribu\u0002 field variables\n\u0003\ntion w \u03c6\u03031 (~x), \u03c6\u03032 (~x) . The limiting case of a deterministic classical field theory\n\u0002 is realized\u0003 by\u0001 a \"sharp probability distribution\" w \u03c6\u03031 (~x), \u03c6\u03032 (~x) , t . For any time\nt this differs from zero only for one precise field value\n\u03c6\u03031,2 (~x) = \u03c61,2 (~x, t), where the \"classical field\" \u03c61,2 (~x, t)\nobeys the Klein-Gordon equation. However, the field product \u03c8 \u2217 (x)\u03c8(x) is now given by a continuous classical observable. Thus the r.h.s. of the expression for the interval\nobservable (30) can take continuous values, not only zero\nor one as required by quantum mechanics. This holds both\nfor a \"deterministic setting\" of a classical field equation and\nfor the probabilistic generalization. If the fields \u03c8(x) are\nassociated with the classical states, the interval observables\nJR (x) are classical observables in the usual sense that they\nhave a fixed value for every classical state. Since the spectrum of these observables is continuous, it seems hard to\nexplain why the observed values in measurements of such\nobservables should only yield zero or one. Quantum mechanics differs in this important aspect from a classical field\ntheory.\nZwitters from quantum field theory?\nRecently, a quantum field theory for Dirac fermions in an\narbitrary external electromagnetic field has been obtained\nfrom a suitable evolution equation for a classical statistical\nensemble of Ising-spins [18]. For every point on a spacelattice the Ising spins can only take two values, corresponding to occupation numbers or bits with values zero or one.\nThe discrete occupation numbers of a multi-fermion system can also take only the values zero and one. They are\nconnected directly with the Ising spins. For this classical\nstatistical ensemble the interval observables JR (x\u0304) can be\nrealized as classical observables [18]. The discrete values\nof JR (x\u0304) are now directly related to the discrete values of\nthe Ising spins. The configurations of Ising spins are therefore a good candidate for the \"substates\" that could give\nrise to probabilistic observables on the level of a reduced\nprobability distribution for isolated particles.\nThe quantum particle in a potential has been realized\nin this classical statistical Ising-type model. A conserved\nparticle number allows the definition of one-particle states.\nThe associated one-particle wave function obeys the Dirac\nequation in an external electromagnetic field. The nonrelativistic approximation yields the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor a particle in a potential [18]. This classical statistical\nensemble therefore realizes particle-wave duality. The discrete spectrum of particle observables as JR (x\u0304) is linked to\nthe discreteness of the Ising-spins, and the continuous wave\nproperties refer to the continuous probability distribution\nfor the discrete configurations or classical states. (In this\n\n\f7\napproach \u03c8Q (x) is not a classical field that characterizes\nthe states of the classical statistical ensemble or a deterministic classical field theory.) The classical statistical ensemble of Ising-spins fully accounts for a quantum particle\n- both for the dynamics of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and\nthe discrete particle properties.\nOne may ask if zwitters can also be realized in such a\nsetting. Of course, one could modify the fundamental evolution equation for the probability distribution of the Isingtype model. This would yield deviations from quantum\nmechanics. Perhaps even more interesting is the possibility\nof obtaining zwitters within the framework of a quantum\nmany-body system. In this case one maintains the evolution equation proposed in ref. [18] such that all quantum\nproperties for a system of Dirac fermions in electromagnetic\nfields are realized. Within such a setting one may now focus on possible isolated one-particle states. This amounts\nto a coarse graining of the information. Instead of the the\nfull probability distribution for all possible configurations\nof Ising spins, which are equivalent to arbitrary states of\nan arbitrary number of fermions, one concentrates on a\nreduced statistical ensemble where the states only reflect\none-particle properties. The reduced probability distribution associates a probability to every state of the reduced\nensemble. Isolation means that the time evolution of the\nreduced wave function can be expressed in terms of the reduced wave function alone, without invoking other details\nof the wave function for the full system. (The time evolution of an isolated system should be independent of the\n\"environment\".)\nA minimal setting of a reduced ensemble for a single\nparticle involves the position x and a discrete internal\nproperty that can take two values, \u03b3 = 1, 2. The real\nclassical wave function \u03c8(x, \u03b3) contains sufficient information for the construction of a complex wave function,\n\u03c8Q (x) = \u03c8(x, 1) + i\u03c8(x, 2). Such a construction of an\nisolated one-particle state has been given explicitly in ref.\n[18] and describes a quantum particle. For the realization of an isolated zwitter particle or classical particle an\nextended variety of states for the reduced ensemble is necessary. The reduced states are now characterized by (z, p)\nor (x, y), i.e. two position variables for one isolated particle. As compared to the quantum particle this indicates\nsome internal structure, since the classical wave function\n\u03c8\u0303C (x, y) depends not only on the \"center of mass position\"\nz, but also on some relative coordinate x \u2212 y. (The rela\u2217\ntion \u03c8\u0303C\n(x, y) = \u03c8\u0303C (y, x) guarantees that \u03c8\u0303C (x, y) contains\nnot more information than a real function of six variables\n(~x, ~y).) At the present stage is not known if isolated subsystems of this type exist for the classical statistical ensemble\nof Ising-spins. It is remarkable that in the Ising-type classical statistical model it seems much easier to realize an\nisolated quantum particle than an isolated classical particle.\nZwitters as collective \"one-particle states\"\nThe formalism employed in this note could find applications for a wide variety of classical or quantum collective\nsystems. So far we have concentrated on quantum particles or zwitters close to quantum particles. The issue that\n\nthe time evolution of an effective one-particle system may\ncorrespond neither to a quantum nor to a classical particle\nis much more general, however. Let us assume a situation\nwhere the relevant states of a collective many-body system\ncan be characterized by a position type variable z and a\nmomentum type variable p. An example are the center of\nmass coordinate and the momentum of a water droplet.\n(We do not discuss here possible generalizations to effective one-particle states with internal degrees of freedom.)\nWe choose a probabilistic description where the probability\ndistribution w(z, p) or the associated classical wave function \u03c8C (z, p) obtains by integrating over all other properties of the collective system except z and p. In other\nwords, w(z, p) is computed by summing the probabilities\nof all microscopic states of the collective system for which\nthe position and momentum observables have common values z and p. (In certain instances the coarse graining of\ninformation within a classical statistical ensemble yields a\nclassical density matrix \u03c1C (z, p, z \u2032 , p\u2032 ) that does not correspond to a pure state with classical wave function \u03c8C (z, p)\n[2]. Generalization to this case is possible.)\nAn effective \"one-particle state\" is realized if the time\nevolution of \u03c8C (z, p) can be written as\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202t \u03c8C (t) = F \u03c8C (t) .\n(33)\n\nHere we \u0002concentrate\non a causal evolution where the func\u0003\ntional F \u03c8C (t) depends only on the wave function at time\nt. An evolution of this type (33) means that only information about probabilities of the reduced system in the form\nof \u03c8C (z, p; t) is needed for determining \u03c8C at a following\ntime t + dt. (This may often be only a reasonable approximation.) The special case of a linear evolution\n\u2202t \u03c8C (t) = \u2212L\u03c8C (t)\n\n(34)\n\ncovers both the classical and the quantum particle. We\nhave concentrated in this note on this simple case. Any L\ndifferent from the Liouville operator L\u0302 or from LW realizes\na zwitter. (The more general case (33) may be called a\nnon-linear zwitter.)\nThe crucial part in the evolution of such collective systems will be the response to an external potential - only\nthis distinguishes a quantum and a classical particle in eqs.\n(13) and (5). It remains to be seen if an effective evolution generator LW in eq. (12) can be realized in a suitable\nmacroscopic experimental setting. (The value of ~ in eq.\n(12) would be replaced in this case by an effective macroscopic constant.) The remarkable behavior of droplets in\nthe experiments reported in ref. [3] suggests objects similar\nto zwitters.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that not only classical particles but also quantum particles can be described\nby a classical statistical ensemble with a suitable time evolution law. In this note we have concentrated on isolated\none-particle states that are described by a probability distribution or classical wave function in phase space. In this\nsetting the common formalism for classical and quantum\nparticles allows for a continuous interpolation by zwitters.\nOn the one hand, a consistent formulation of a probabilistic theory that is arbitrarily close to quantum mechanics\n\n\f8\nallows for quantitative experimental tests of the validity\nof quantum theory by establishing bounds on a small parameter, rather than yes/no tests between classical and\nquantum. On the other hand, our findings raise the interesting question if isolated \"one-particle states\" with the\ntime evolution of zwitters could be realized within a clas-\n\nsical or quantum many-body theory. Such states could be\ncollective states as droplets of a liquid or a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate.\n\n[1] C. Wetterich, Ann. Phys.
