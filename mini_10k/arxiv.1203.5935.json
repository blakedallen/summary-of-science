[1], rotational and vibrational dynamics of several molecules\n(say, OCS, CO2 , CO, N2 O, HCCCN, etc., represented by M) embedded in bulk He-II and its\nnano-droplets and clusters of the form M:HeN (where N = 1, 2, 3, ... is the number of He atoms)\nhave been extensively investigated. While, in a break through work, Grebenov et.al. [2] found\nthat OCS molecule embedded in 4 He droplets, isolated in the normal phase of liquid 3 He, rotates\nalmost like a free rotor if the droplet has about 60 or more 4 He atoms, systematic experimental\nstudy of M:HeN clusters have demonstrated non-trivial dependence of their rotational constant\nB (or moment of inertia, I) and vibrational frequency shift \u2206\u03bd (of select modes of vibrations)\nwith N which concludes that superfluidity of 4 He atoms has observable impact on B of such\nsmall clusters as well [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. A number of theoretical models, such as, (i) super-molecule\nmodel [8], (ii) two fluid model [2, 9], (iii) quantum hydrodynamic model [10], etc., have been\nused to explain the initial observations. Simulation techniques have also been used, recently,\nto explain the phenomenon but with limited success at quantitative scale [11, 12, 13, 14, 15,\n16, 17, 18]. It is not surprising because all these models associate the phenomenon with the\nsuperfluidity of 4 He atoms which by itself is not clearly understood [19, 20].\nThe conventional microscopic theory (CMT) [19, 20] of a system of interacting bosons (SIB),\nsuch as liquid 4 He, uses single particle basis (SPB) for its description. It considers that particles\noccupy different quantum states of a single particle placed in a box of volume V of the system\nand these states are described by plane waves (uk (r) = A exp (ik.r) where symbols have their\nusual meaning); in other words a single particle represents the basic unit with an assumption\nthat its momentum remains a good quantum number even in the superfluid state of the system.\nThe theory concludes that: (1) the state of liquid 4 He at a temperature (T ) can be identified by\nthe momentum distribution N (p) of its particles where different number of particles Np (T ) have\ndifferent p, and (2) with the onset of superfluid transition, N (p) does not change significantly\nexcept for the existence of a fraction of particles, np=0 (T ) = Np=0 /N having p = 0 in LT phase.\nAccordingly, even the ground state (G-state) of liquid 4 He has different number of atoms in the\nstates of different momenta, viz., Np=0 in p(=h\u0304k) = 0 state and Np6=0 in several states of nonzero momenta, k1 , k2 , k3 , ... ... etc. (expressed in wave number). Based on different estimates\nby a large number of theoretical and experimental studies, Np=0 (p = 0 condensate) is believed\nto fall around 10% [19, 21] leaving Np6=0 (non-condensate) to about 90%. In what follows CMT\nidentifies that p = 0 condensate as the origin of superfluidity and related properties of He-II and\nthe same view point is attributed to the superfluidity exhibited by microscopic systems of 4 He\natoms (viz., droplets and clustes) too. The advances in CMT made over the last several years\n[20] suggest that superfluid phase of liquid 4 He also has (in addition to p = 0 condensate) pair\ncondensate (similar to Copper pair condensation in superconductors) or a composite condensate\n(p = 0 condensate, pair condensate, 3 particle condensate, etc.) as the origin of superfluidity.\nWe note that SPB used in CMT not only complicates the process of finding different aspects of a SIB, e.g., the expectation value of inter-particle interaction which becomes infinitely\nrepulsive for short distances, but also ignores the reality that the states of wave superposition assumed by the particles at low T can not be described by uk (r). It is well known that:\n(i) two particles (say P1 and P2) in the state of their wave superposition are described by\n\u03a8(1, 2) = [uk (r)uk (r) \u00b1 uk (r)uk (r))] which basically represents a pair of particles moving with\nequal and opposite momenta (q, -q) with respect to their CM which moves with momentum\nK in the laboratory frame and (ii) positions (r1 , and r2 ), momenta (k1 and k2 ) and energies\n2\n\n\f(\u000f1 and \u000f2 ) of two particles as separate entities lose their meaning in this state.\nWhile superfluidity undoubtedly has a relation with the experimental observation of the\nrotation of a molecule embedded in a 4 He droplet and the non-trivial N \u2212dependence of B\nof M:4 HeN cluster, it certainly has no relation with p = 0 condensate because, as estblished\nunequivocally by one of us (Jain [22]), p = 0 condensate does not exist in the superfluid phase of\na SIB. Starting with an assumption that the G-state of liquid 4 He has non-zero values of both,\nNp=0 and Np6=0 , as concluded by CMT, Jain [22] finds that: (i) such an N (p) does not represent\na state of minimum possible energy as expected for the G-state of every physical system, (ii) all\nparticles in the true G-state of a SIB have identically equal enegy (\u03b5o = h2 /8md2 with h being\nthe Planck constant, m the mass of a particle and d = (V/N )1/3 ) and corresponding non-zero\nmomentum (qo = \u03c0/d), and (iii) the real form BEC that exists in a SIB is the macroscopic\ncondensation of bosons as (q, -q) pairs in their G-state characterized by q = qo = \u03c0/d and\nK = 0.\nMotivated by all such observations, one of us [23] used more realistic pair of particle basis\nPPB to conclude his non-conventional microscopic theory (NCMT) which emphasizes a pair\nas the basic unit of the system. The theory not only explains different properties of He-II\nat quantitative scale [23, 24, 25] but also reveals that: (i) particles (G-state) of a SIB have\nidentically equal energy (\u03b5o ) and corresponding non-zero q = qo = \u03c0/d which agrees with\na recent study by Jain [23], (ii) they constitute a kind of close packed arrangement of their\nrepresentative wave packets (CPA-WP) of identically equal size \u03bb/2 = h/2p = d, (iii) they are\nallowed to move only coherently in order of their locations, obviously, with no relative motion\nand mutual collision, and (iv) they occupy phase (\u03c6) positions which differ by \u2206\u03c6 = 2n\u03c0 (with\nn = 1,2,3, ...). In addition, the theory finds that all the three characteristics of the G-state are\nretained by the superfluid phase over the entire range of temperature from T = 0 to T\u03bb and\nthe entire system assumes a kind of collective binding for which it behaves like a macroscopic\nmolecule.\nSince 4 He atoms in M:HeN clusters are confined to a space of few \u00c5 size, it is evident that\neach 4 He atom has non-zero energy and corresponding non-zero momentum for the confinement.\nThis undoubtedly proves the absence of p = 0 condensate in these systems and we use these\naspects of Jain's NCMT [23] to frame a model which provides a better account for the typical\nnature of non-trivial dependence of B on N revealed from experimental observations on selected\nM:HeN clusters. In this context it may be mentioned that our intial efforts [26] tried to use\nsome simple thoughts to explain the effect by presuming that: (i) each added atom which takes\nthe cluster from M:HeN to M:HeN +1 can significantly change the positions of other 4 He atoms\nfrom the axis of rotation, and (ii) with N increasing beyond its certain value (depending on\nseveral physico-chemical aspects of M), 4 He atoms start occupying the second position from M\n(e.g. in M(zero)-4 He(first)-4 He(second)) and these atoms interact so weekly with the rotor-part\nof cluster (M and few 4 He atoms, -at first position, which interact directly with M) that they\ndo not follow the rotation of the rotor. In a sense the net potential seen by the rotor part\nof the cluster appears to remain constant with a change in the angular position of the rotor.\nIn other words the rotor (when rotating about its axis) seems to role over a equi-potential\nsurface; else if there are hills and valleys in the surface, the height of hills is much lower than\nthe energy of rotational excitation of the rotor. Although these efforts rendered a satisfying\naccount of the phenomenon, they could not find a clear relation to superfluidity of 4 He atoms\n3\n\n\fand this motivated us in concluding this model which not only associates an important aspect\nof superfluid He-II with the non-trivial dependence of I on N but also clarifies how only few\n4\nHe atoms attached directly to M take part in the rotation and rests do not follow the rotation\neffectively.\nIn what follows from the experimentally observed N dependence of B (represented typically\nby a curve depicted in Fig.(1)), we observe the following:\n(A) B decreases when N is increased from N = N i (the lowest N for which experimental data\nare available) to certain N = N \u2217 that may depend on several factors like the size and symmetry\nof the structure of M, the strength of M-He interaction, etc.\n(B) It remains nearly constant when N is increased beyond N \u2217 only by 1 or 2 or so but increases\nwith further increase in N up to another value, say N1 .\n(C) When N is increased beyond N1 , B is observed to decrease and increase alternately over\ndifferent ranges of N , N1 \u2212 N2 , N2 \u2212 N3 , N3 \u2212 N4 , and N4 \u2212 N5 and so on.\n(D) \u2206\u03bd is observed first to increase linearly for first few 4 He atoms (with N < N \u2217 ) but beyond\nthis point it decreases with nearly a linear dependence on N ; however, the slope of this decrease\nhas different values over the ranges, N \u2217 \u2212 N1 , N1 \u2212 N2 , N2 \u2212 N3 , N3 \u2212 N4 , and so on.\nIt is well known that \u2206\u03bd is a simple consequence of a change in potential V (Q1 , Q2 , ......QS )\n(governing all the S possible vibrational modes of M) with changing N . It could be explained in\nterms of a small change in the related potential constant appearing in the harmonic component\nin the expansion of V (Q1 , Q2 , ......QS ). Although, it is difficult to argue in favour of increase or\ndecrease in the value of potential constant of the chosen vibration, yet, however, a simple logic\nindicates that \u03bd should increase for first few 4 He atoms which occupy position in the closest\nvicinity of M since He-atoms are saturated with the electron charge density for which they\nwould give away a small fraction of their own electron density to M which should strengthen\nthe forces that govern its different modes of vibration and this is corroborated by experimental\nobservation. Although, with 4 He atoms occupying second or third, ... positions counting from\nM (at zero-th position), it is difficult to argue whether \u03bd would increase or decrease with N ,\nhowever, it is clear the effect on \u03bd should decrease with each added atom and this expectation\nagrees with decrease in slope of \u2206\u03bd vs N observed experimentally. In what follows from these\npoints, the change in \u2206\u03bd with N has nothing to do with microscopic superfluidity of the 4 He\natoms in the cluster. Hence, in this paper, we simply concentrate to find the origin of (A), (B)\nand (C) and conclude a general model of the phenomenon.\n1. To a good approximation, the experimental observation of decrease in B (or increase in I)\nfor N i to N \u2217 can be explained by using rigid rotor picture for the cluster since this falls in line\nwith the fact that a 4 He atom interacts more strongly with M than with another 4 He atom,\nthe structure of the cluster M:HeN for N = N i to N = N \u2217 can, therefore, be presumed to have\na rigid rotor structure for the first few rotational excitations of each cluster. We note that N \u2217\ncan be different for different M (depending on its physico-chemical nature), while N i can, in\nprinciple, be as small as 1.\n2. However, the non-trivial dependence of B on N represented by the observations that B\nremains nearly unchanged when N changes by one or two 4 He-atoms beyond N \u2217 and there\n4\n\n\fafter it follows cycles of its increase from N \u2217 + \u2206N to N1 , N2 to N3 , ... and decrease from\nN1 to N2 , N3 to N4 , ... . This unexpected observation, naturally indicates its relation with\nsuperfluidity of 4 He-atoms. Consequently, we try to explain it interms of an important aspect\nof superfluid 4 He exhibited by it ubder the influence of its rotation.\nThe fact, that different atoms on different concentric circles around the axis of a quantum\nvortex in He-II move coherently in order of their locations in a manner that they have no\ndifference in their angular momentum [27] implies that their angular velocity (\u03c9) changes as\nr\u22122 where r is the distance of the atom from the axis of the vortex. This differs from atoms of\na rigid body rotor where all atoms move around the axis of rotation with identically equal \u03c9.\nIn the following we consider the example of a set of 4 He atoms moving on two concentric circles\naround the axis of rotation (as shown in Fig.2A) under the condition of: (i) constant angular\nvelocity and (ii) constant angular momentum. To this effect we evaluate the kinetic energy of\nthe set by using,\n12\n6\nX\nnj\nni 2 2 X\nmr1 \u03c91 +\nmr22 \u03c922 ,\n(1)\nE=\nj 2\ni 2\nwhere we have ni = 1, 2, 3, ...6 and nj = 1, 2, 3, ...12 with indices i and j to identify different\natoms on orbits 1 and 2, respectively. Presuming that the radii of orbits 1 and 2 satisfy\nr2 = 2r1 = 2ro\n\n(2)\n\nand all atoms move as a single rigid body with\n\u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c9o ,\n\n(3)\n\nwe have\ni\ni\n1h\n1\n1h\nor I = 54mro2 .\n(4)\n6mro2 \u03c9o2 + 48mro2 \u03c9o2 =\n54mro2 \u03c9o2 = I\u03c9o2\n2\n2\n2\nSince the condition of constant angular momentum, applied to two atoms moving on different\norbits of radius r1 and r2 (cf., Fig.2B) renders\n\nE=\n\nmr12 \u03c91 = mr22 \u03c92 = C\n\nor \u03c9 \u221d r\u22122 ,\n\n(constant)\n\n(5)\n\nwhich implies that corresponding linear velocity v = r\u03c9 changes as r\u22121 . As expected, this\nagrees with the well known dependence of v on r in a quantum vortex observed in superfluid\n4\nHe [27]. Using Eqn.(5) in Eqn.(1), we get\n\"\n\n1\nr1\nE=\n6mr12 \u03c912 + 12mr22 \u03c912\n2\nr2\n\u0012\n\n\u00134 #\n\n(6)\n\nwhich for the orbits satisfying Eqn.(2) and \u03c91 = \u03c9o renders\ni\n1\n1\n1h\n6mro2 \u03c9o2 + 12mro2 \u03c9o2\n=\n9mro2 \u03c9o2 ;\nwith I = 9mro2 .\n(7)\n2\n4\n2\nEqn.(6) clearly reveals that the contribution to I from an atom at a distance r2 , under the\ncondition of constant angular momentum (Eqn. 5), gets reduced by a significant factor of\n(r1 /r2 )4 (since r1 < r2 ) in comparison to that found under the condition of constant angular\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nE=\n\n5\n\n\fvelocity (Eqn.(4)). As an example, the contribution to I by an atom added to an orbit satisfying\nr2 = 2r1 , Eqn.(2) gets reduced to a value as low as 1/16 (i.e. \u22486.3%) and for the orbit satisfying\nr2 = 3r1 , the said contribution is as low as 1/81 (or \u22481.3%). This speaks of the smallness of\nthe contribution of an added atom to the I of the cluster when it goes to an orbit of higher r\nand evinces that the said atom has a +ve contribution indicating that IN +1 > IN .\nIn what follows the above stated inferences, we can expect a small increase or almost no\nchange in I for each added atom to the cluster with N = N \u2217 . However, it gives no clue for the\nexperimental observations of IN +1 < IN for N > N \u2217 . To this effect our critical thinking reveals\nthat the phenomenon is possible only if the added atom reduces the distance of 4 He atoms (all\nthe N atoms or a few of them) in M:4 HeN cluster from the axis of rotation to an extent that\ncontribution to I by the added single atom is over compensated by the decrease in IN . It is\nalso possible if the added atom transforms the structure of M:4 HeN cluster in a manner that\none atom from first orbit of radius r1 moves to the orbit of radius r2 of the added atom (as\nshown in Fig.2C); in this case the net change \u2206I = IN +1 \u2212 IN becomes\n\u2206I =\n\nr4\n2mr22 14\nr2\n\n\"\n\n\u2212\n\nmr12\n\n=\n\nmr12\n\nr2\n2 12 \u2212 1\nr2\n\n#\n\n(8)\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhich assumes a \u2212ve value for r2 > 2r1 indicating that IN +1 < IN when r2 > 2r1 . Using\nthis possibility for N increasing beyond N \u2217 by 1 atom, we have\n\u2206I = \u22120.5mro2\n\n(9)\n\nby using Eqns.(2) and (8). Presuming further that another atom moves similarly from orbit-1\nto orbit-2 when an added atom to the cluster occupies orbit-2 as shown in Fig.2D, we have\nr2\nr4\n\u2206I = 4mr22 14 \u2212 2mr12 = mr12 4 12 \u2212 2 = \u22121.0mro2\nr2\nr2\n\"\n\n#\n\n(10)\n\nfor orbits satisfying Eqn.(2). Generalizing Eqns.(8) and Eqn.(10), we have\n\"\n\n\u2206I =\n\nmr12\n\nr2\n2nc\n2nc 12 \u2212 nc = mro2\n\u2212 nc\nr2\n\u03b12\n#\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(11)\n\nwhich represents the change in I when nc atoms (above N \u2217 ) added to orbit-2 (making total\nN = N \u2217 + nc ) induce nc \u221a\natoms from orbit-1 to jump to orbit-2. Eqn.(11) reveals that I has no\nchange if \u03b1(= r2 /r1 ) = 2, it decreases by \u2206I = \u22120.5nc mro2 for r2 = 2r1 = 2ro (i.e., \u03b1 = 2)\nand by a maximum of \u2206I = \u2212nc mro2 for r2 >> r1 (= ro ). Such changes in I for nc = 1, 2, 3, ...\nfor different \u03b1 = r2 /r1 are depicted in Fig.3 for their better perception.\nFor a possible situation where no atom jumps from orbit-1 to orbit-2 when (nc + 1)-th atom\nis added to orbit-2, it is evident that the added atom increases I by mro2 /\u03b12 . We have\n2nc\n2 1\n\u2212\nn\n+\nmr\n.\n(12)\nc\no\n\u03b12\n\u03b12\nwhich again means IN +1 > IN provided the added atom makes no change in \u03b1. However, if\nit does and changes in r2 and r1 are such that \u03b1 increases to \u03b1\u2217 = \u03b1 + \u2206\u03b1, then by using\nEqn.(12), we find\n2(2nc + 1)\u2206\u03b1\n\u03b4(\u2206I) = \u2206I(\u03b1\u2217 ) \u2212 \u2206I(\u03b1) = \u2212mro2\n.\n(13)\n\u03b13\n\u2206I = mro2\n\n\u0015\n\n\u0014\n\n6\n\n\fWe note that this \u2212ve change in I can overcompensate the increase in I by mro2 /\u03b12 if\n\u03b1\n\u2206\u03b1 \u2265\n2(2nc + 1)\n\n1\nr2\n=\n2(2nc + 1) r1\n\n!\n\n(14)\n\nwhich is obtained by equating RHS of Eqn.(13) to mro2 /\u03b12 . This indicates that I of the cluster\ncan have continuous decrease with increase in N (possibly from N \u2217 to N1 ) if \u03b1 = r2 /r1 increases\nby an appropriate value of \u2206\u03b1 with each added atom. In other words an agreement between\ntheory and experiment can be seen by using nc , \u03b1, and \u2206\u03b1 as adjustable parameters. Note\nthat increase in \u03b1 is possible both by decrease in r1 and increase in r2 when an atom is added\nto the cluster. However, it appears that desired increase in r2 is more probable than decrease\nin r1 . As revealed by Eqn.(14), decrease in I is possible if \u2206\u03b1/\u03b1 increases by more than 16.6%,\n10% and 7.1%, respectively, in case of nc = 1. 2, and 3. These aspects are depicted in Fig.4\nfor their better understanding.\nSumming up the possible explanation for the phenomenon in the light of our preceding\nanalysis, we may mention that :\n(1) With increasing N from N i to N \u2217 , 4 He atoms in M:4 HeN cluster (for N \u2264 N \u2217 ) seem to have\nreasonably strong binding with M for which the cluster as whole represents a rigid rotor, to a\ngood approximation, and its I increases (or corresponding B decreases) with N in agreement\nwith experiments (cf. Fig.1, for N \u2264 N \u2217 ).\n(2) For nearly no change in IN from IN \u2217 , when N is set to have a value N \u2217 + \u2206N (where \u2206N\nhas only small value such as 1 or 2 or so), it appears that each of the \u2206N atoms go to orbit 2\nfor which \u2206I(= IN \u2217 +1 \u2212 IN \u2217 ) is \u2248 6.3% of the contribution of an atom in orbit 1. Such a small\nincrease can be easily compensated if the contribution to IN \u2217 +1 due to each of the N \u2217 atoms\nin orbit 1 gets reduced by 6.3/N \u2217 % presumably due to small decrease, \u2206r, in the distance of\natoms from the axis of rotation of M:4 HeN \u2217 and this does not demand necessarily a decrease\nin M-4 He bond length; a decrease by \u2206r in the projection of the bond on the plane \u22a5 to the\naxis of rotation would suffice and this can be estimated to fall around 6.3/2N \u2217 % of the said\nprojection which equals to \u2248 0.8% if N \u2217 = 4, or 0.5% if N \u2217 = 6 or \u2248 0.4% if N \u2217 = 8. Such\na small change can easily be expected as a possible effect of an atom added to M:4 HeN \u2217 or\nanother added to M:4 HeN \u2217 +1 ; this naturally explains the said observation.\n(3) For the remaining part of IN vs. N curve (i.e., for N > N \u2217 + \u2206N ) where IN is observed\nto have significant decrease with increase in N , changes in \u03b1 = r2 /r1 along with the jump\nof an atom from orbit 1 to orbit 2 seem to take place when an atom is added to orbit 2.\nDepending on the physico-chemical nature and size of M, the decrease in IN for N changing\nfrom N = N \u2217 + \u2206N to N = N1 can be explained by choosing nc = 1 and 2 ... (in different\nsteps) clubbed with appropriate values of \u03b1 and \u2206\u03b1. This speaks of the sensitivity of the\nchanges in IN on \u03b1 and \u2206\u03b1 as well as \u2206r (change in the said projection of M-4 He bond length).\nThis naturally simplifies the basis our understanding of the observed increase and decrease in\nI (Fig.1) with N . (4) The decrease in B (increase in I) for N increasing from N1 to N2 is\nas per normal expectation. However, each atom added to the cluster in this range contributes\nonly very small fraction of the contribution to I by an atom in orbit 1. Guided by this fact it\nappears that value of \u03b1, \u2206\u03b1 and \u2206r should explain the N \u2212 dependence of IN not only in this\nrange but for all values of N > N1 .\nIdentifying the ranges, 0 \u2212 N1 , N1 \u2212 N2 , N2 \u2212 N3 , etc. (Fig. 1) as cycles of inccrease and\n7\n\n\fdecrease in IN , it appears that M:4 HeN cluster has different shells of 4 He atoms around M and\neach cycle represents the completion of one shell. While 4 He atoms in the first shell have direct\nbond with M, those in second, third, ... shells are separated from M, respectively, by 1, 2, ...\n4\nHe atoms in between. The maximum number of 4 He atoms, in a particular shell increases\nin proportion of R2 (where R is the radius of the shell which changes from one shell to next\nshell in units of the diameter of the sphere which represents the shape and size of 4 He atom;\nhowever it also depends on the shape and size of M. Assuming that M has a shape and size\nof a 4 He atom, a rough estimate reveals that the number of 4 He atoms in first, second and\nthird shells, should be around 6, 18 and 40, respectively. However, it may be emphasized that\nthese numbers agree approximately with experimental values because M may have linear or a\ncomplex structure. Further, it may also be mentioned that it is not the length of M-4 He bond\nwhich changes much with atoms added to the cluster but the projection of this bond on the\nplane \u22a5 to the axis of the rotor which should be considered to explain the changes in IN with\nadded 4 He atoms that we observe through experiments.\nThe experimental observations seem to indicate that the part of M:4 HeN cluster which\nrotates, to a good approximation as a rigid rotor, has fewer than N \u2217 4 He atoms in clusters of\nN >> N \u2217 . This agrees with our suggestion that nc (= 1 or 2, or so) atoms move from orbit\n1 to orbit 2 with increasing N beyond N \u2217 . However, the physics of this possibility is not yet\nvery clear.\nIn the light of the fact that 4 He atoms in superfluid state make a close packed arrangement\nof their wave packets (CPA-WP) supported by a number of experimental observations such as\nthe observation of Stark effect of roton transition seen through microwave absorption [28] and\nthe unequivocal conclusions of a number of theoretical studies [22, 23, 24], the rotor part of\nthe cluster in CPA-WP type arrangement of 4 He atoms may in certain cases experience a kind\nof low energy potential barrier with an axial symmetry of the order n (as shown in Fig.5). A\ntheoretical analysis for such a case [29] reveals that the effective I of the rotor has a lower value\nthat depends on the height and symmetry of Vn (cf., Fig. 5). This renders an additional reason\nfor a small decrease in I.\nAs concluded by Jain's NCMT of a system of interacting bosons such as liquid 4 He [23],\natoms in He-II not only move coherently in order of their locations but also have identically\nequal angular momentum when they move on different concentric paths around the axis of a\nquantum vortex; in fact this theory for the first time answers a question raised by Wilks [27]\nin relation to Feynman's account for the origin of quantized circulation [30]. Wilks has rightly\nargued that Feynman's basis for quantum vortices in He-II is equally valid for He-I but the\nlatter does not show any quantum vortex. Using a basic aspect of quantum vortices observed\nin He-II, we discover a model which has enough potential to explain qualitatively the typical\nnature of experimentally observed N dependence of the rotational constant B of the rotor part\nof the cluster M:HeN . Naturally, the question, how exactly superfluidity is related to the said\ndependence of B is answered with utmost clarity. We hope that this model, when used with\nsimulation techniques on individual cluster, would render results that would agree closely with\nexperiments. This would not only help in improving the model but also for having a clear\nunderstanding of the phenomenon. However, we could not take up this task for the want of\nfacilities of computer simulations at our end.\n\n8\n\n\fReferences\n[1] S. Goyal, D. L. Schutt and G. Scoles, Phys. Rev.
