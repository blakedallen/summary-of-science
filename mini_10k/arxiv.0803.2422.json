Eagles [1] and Leggett [2] were perhaps the first\nto observe that a many-fermion system can display both\nthe BCS and the BEC behavior, and these two regimes\nare connected by a smooth crossover as the strength of\nthe attractive interaction between the fermions is varied.\nThe crossover can be described at least qualitatively well\nby the conventional mean-field approximation provided\none determines the chemical potential self-consistenly by\nfixing the overall particle density.\nHowever, it was only recently that the BCS\u2013BEC\ncrossover could be realized experimentally using ultracold atomic Fermi gases [3, 4, 5, 6], where the strength\nof the interaction can be tuned by external magnetic\nfield and thereby, using the Feshbach resonance, cover\nthe whole range between the BCS and BEC limits. The\ndilute atomic gases represent particularly clean and well\ncontrolled examples of interacting many-body systems.\nIt is believed that they may provide an ideal theoretical\nplayground for development of many-body techniques,\nthat would be later applied to more complicated strongly\ncorrelated systems.\nThe mean-field theory of Eagles and Leggett was for\nthe first time improved by Nozi\u00e8res and Schmitt-Rink\n[7] who included the contribution of the pair fluctuations to the total particle density. In the past decade,\nvarious extensions of the mean-field approximation have\nbeen proposed, including boson\u2013fermion models [8] as\nwell as purely fermionic self-consistent schemes [9, 10].\nAn extensive list of references may be found in the re-\n\n\u2020 On leave from Department of Theoretical Physics, Nuclear Physics\nInstitute ASCR, 25068 \u0158e\u017e, Czech Republic\n\u2217 Electronic address: brauner@ujf.cas.cz\n\nviews [11, 12]. The most recently developed techniques\nare compared in [13]. Simultaneously to the analytic approximation schemes, the interacting Fermi gas is also\nbeing studied using numerical Monte Carlo simulations\n[14, 15].\nIn high-energy physics, the analogy with BCS superconductivity was used long ago by Nambu and JonaLasinio [16, 17] to propose a model for dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Later, Cooper pairing of two\nfermions near their Fermi surface found an application\nin the physics of dense nuclear/quark matter, giving rise\nin particular to the phenomenon of color superconductivity [18, 19]; see [20] for the most recent review. The\ncrossover physics is relevant for these high-energy systems because of the strong-coupling nature of quantum\nchromodynamics. Concretely, the so-called pseudogap\nphase as a precursor to superfluidity of tightly bound\nCooper pairs was investigated in models of chiral symmetry breaking [21, 22, 23, 24] as well as color superconductivity [25]. The structural change of Cooper pairs\nwith increasing coupling strength and the possibility of\ntheir BEC were studied in [26, 27, 28, 29]. The spectrum\nof diquarks in various color-superconducting phases was\ninvestigated by Ebert et al. [30, 31].\nThe actual crossover between the BCS and BEC\nregimes in dense quark matter in dependence on the coupling strength has started to be studied only recently\n[32, 33, 34]. Perhaps the first attempts to go beyond\nthe mean-field approximation have been made in Refs.\n[35, 36, 37]. In particular, Abuki [36] has conducted an\nextensive study of fluctuation effects in the normal phase,\nusing the Gaussian approximation. The goal of this paper is to investigate the spectrum of the bosonic collective\nmodes below the critical temperature. Thereby we construct a framework for description of fluctuation effects\nin the superfluid phase.\nThe plan of the paper is following. In the next section, we derive the general formulas valid for a class\nof models of the Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) type, that\ndescribe (even-parity) spin-zero pairing in relativistic\nfermion matter. The model of Abuki [36], which is a\n\n\f2\nspecial case, is then investigated in detail in the following section. In particular, we study the spectral properties of the bosonic collective modes in the mean-field\napproximation. Possible extensions of the present work\nare discussed in the conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nNJL MODELS OF PAIRING\nA.\n\nModel definition\n\nWe consider the general class of models defined by the\nLagrangian\nL = \u03c8\u0304(i\u2202/ + \u03bc\u03b30 \u2212 m)\u03c8 +\n\nGX T\n(\u03c8 Ta \u03c8)(\u03c8\u0304 T\u0304a \u03c8\u0304 T ), (1)\n4 a\n\nwhere T\u0304a = \u03b30 Ta\u2020 \u03b30 . The spinor \u03c8 denotes a set of\nfermion flavors with common mass m and chemical potential \u03bc, while Ta are matrices that furnish an antisymmetric tensor representation under the symmetry\ntransformations acting on \u03c8. In general, they act on\nboth Dirac and flavor indices of \u03c8. Even though the\nLagrangian (1) covers, in a simplified manner, a number of systems investigated in literature [38], at this\nstage we completely neglect correlations in the fermion\u2013\nantifermion channel that may lead to dynamical breaking\nof the chiral symmetry.\nThis model is analyzed using the standard Hubbard\u2013\nStratonovich transformation. We start with the definition of the Nambu spinor \u03a8 = (\u03c8, \u03c8 C )T [49]. Using the\ncharge conjugate field, \u03c8 C = C \u03c8\u0304 T , the interaction term\n2\nC\n\u22121\nTa .\nmay be rewritten as G\n4 \u03c8\u0304 Pa \u03c8 , where Pa = C\nIt is removed from the Lagrangian by introducing new\nauxiliary scalar fields \u2206a and adding\n\u2206L = \u2212\n\n\u0013 2\n\u0012\n1\nG\n0 0\n\u03a8 .\n\u2206a \u2212 \u03a8\u0304\nPa 0\nG\n2\n\nThe new, semibosonized Lagrangian reads\nLsemi = \u2212\n\n1\n1 \u2217\n\u2206a \u2206a + \u03a8\u0304D\u22121 \u03a8,\nG\n2\n\nThis functional integral, of course, cannot be evaluated\nexactly. Note that the bosonized action Seff includes the\neffect of fermion loops to all orders, due to the presence of\nthe determinant of the inverse fermion propagator D\u22121 .\nIn other words, it contains all Feynman graphs with the\nscalar fields as external lines. It is thus to be interpreted\nas a classical action for the scalars \u2206a , \u2206\u2217a , and the above\nfunctional integral as the generating functional of their\nGreen's functions (at zero source). This can be determined from the quantum effective action associated to\nthe classical action Seff , being the sum of all one-bosonirreducible graphs.\nSince we assume that the leading nonperturbative behavior, which gives rise to the pairing, is borne by the\nfermion loops that have already been resummed to all\norders, the expansion in the number of bosonic loops provides a natural approximation scheme for the calculation\nof the thermodynamic potential. The tree level corresponds to simply setting \u03b2\u03a9MF = Seff : This is the standard mean-field approximation. At one loop, the thermodynamic potential would be given by\n\u03b2\u03a91L = \u03b2\u03a9MF +\n\nD\n\n\u22121\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ni\u2202/ + \u03b30 \u03bc \u2212 m\n\u2206a P\u0304a\n,\n\u2206\u2217a Pa\ni\u2202/ \u2212 \u03b30 \u03bc \u2212 m\n\n(2)\n\nis the fermion propagator in the coordinate space.

Note that in the\nnormal phase, Eq. (4) reduces to the Gaussian approximation adopted by Abuki [36].

(15) in Ref. [36].\nFull information about the spectrum of bosonic collective states may be obtained by investigating the spectral density, \u03c1(\u03c9, p), associated to the matrix correlation\nfunction \u039e, defined by\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\u039e\u22121 (i\u03a9N , p) ab = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03c9 \u03c1ab (\u03c9, p)\n.\n\u03c0 i\u03a9N \u2212 \u03c9\n\nIn general, we would like to use the relation\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c1ab (\u03c9, p) = Im \u039e\u22121 (\u03c9 + i\u03b4, p) ab ,\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nin order to extract the spectral information from the\nimaginary part of the pair correlation function, analytically continued to the real axis. However, this should be\ndone with some care for Eq. (13) holds only when the\nspectral density \u03c1ab (\u03c9, p) defined by Eq. (12) is real.\n\nD.\n\nMean-field analysis\n\nAssuming that in thermodynamic equilibrium the system relaxes to a homogeneous state, the mean-field thermodynamic potential \u03a9MF is given by Eq.

(14) embodies two different\nsets of gap parameters. First, the \u2206a 's, which carry the\nlabel of the Cooper pair representation of the symmetry,\nand represent the order parameters for symmetry breaking. Second, the \u2206r 's, which determine the gaps in the\nfermion excitation spectrum. While the \u2206a 's transform\nas an antisymmetric tensor under the symmetry transformations acting on \u03c8 and may in general be complex,\nthe \u2206r 's are by construction invariants of the symmetry\nand are always real.\nThese two sets of parameters may be relatedPwith the\nhelp of the expression \u2206a \u2206\u2217b Q\u2020a Qb = M M \u2020 = r \u22062r Pr .\nBy taking the trace we find\nN\n\nX\na\n\n|\u2206a |2 =\n\nX\n\n\u22062r .\n\nr\n\nThis clarifies the physical content of the normalization\nfactor N : It counts the number of fermion degrees of\nfreedom participating in the formation of a particular\nCooper pair. Plugging this result back into Eq. (14),\nwe immediately arrive at the standard mean-field gap\n\nequation and the equation for the particle number density\nn,\nX Z d3 k 1 \u2212 2f (E e )\nkr\n\u2206r = \u2206r N G\n,\n(15)\ne\n3\n(2\u03c0)\n2E\nkr\ne=\u00b1\nX X Z d3 k e\u03be e\ne\nk\n[1 \u2212 2f (Ekr\n)] .\n(16)\nn=\n3 Ee\n(2\u03c0)\nkr\nr e=\u00b1\nThe total number density n is fixed by the value of the\nFermi momentum kF , as n = kF3 /(3\u03c0 2 ) times the number\nof fermion flavors.\nE.\n\nRenormalization\n\nThe momentum integral in Eq. (15) (as well as in other\nequations depending explicitly on the coupling) is badly\ndivergent. This can be taken care of by trading the bare\ncoupling G for the physical s-wave scattering length at\nzero temperature and density, or the renormalized coupling GR , defined by [36]\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\nN\nd3 k\n1\n1\n1\n.\n+\n=\u2212\n+\nG\nGR\n2\n(2\u03c0)3 \u01ebk + m \u01ebk \u2212 m\nAs opposed to the case of nonrelativistic fermion matter, the remaining momentum integration is still divergent, but only mildly, logarithmically. In numerical computations, it is regulated with a sharp three-momentum\ncutoff \u039b. All equations of the theory may be rewritten\nin such a way that the cancelation of the leading divergences is manifest. The resulting formulas are useful for\nthe numerical implementation, but otherwise are rather\ncumbersome. Just for illustration, we show here the gap\nequation and the equation for number density,\ne\nX Z d3 k \u0014 m2\n1\n2f (Ekr\n)\n\u2206r = \u2212 \u2206r N GR\n\u2212\n\u2212\n2\ne\n3\n2\n(2\u03c0)\nE\nk \u01ebk\nkr\ne=\u00b1\n\u0015\n2\n2\n1\n\u2206r\n2\u03bc\n+ e \u2212e e\n\u2212e \u2212\ne (E e + \u03be e ) ,\n\u01ebk Ekr\nEkr Ekr (Ekr + Ekr\n)\nkr\nk\n\nn=\n\n\u0014\nd3 k\n\u03beke\ne\n\u22122e\ne f (Ekr )\n3\n(2\u03c0)\nE\nkr\ne=\u00b1\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ne\nEkr\n+ \u03beke\n\u03bc\u22062r\n1 + \u2212e\n.\n+ e \u2212e e\n\u2212e\nEkr Ekr (Ekr + Ekr\n)\nEkr + \u03bek\u2212e\n\nXXZ\nr\n\nThe procedure outlined above is sufficient to renormalize the mean-field thermodynamic potential and its\nderivates, the gap and number equations. On the other\nhand, one must be more careful when calculating the\ncorrelator \u039eab (5), or in general any fermion loop with\nnonzero external momentum. The point is that the momentum assignment for the internal fermion lines is not\ncompletely fixed by momentum conservation in the interaction vertices; it is unique up to a shift of the integration variable. Such a shift, however, is not permitted\n\n\f5\nin an integral with stronger than logarithmic divergence\n[50]. Therefore, we are led to consider the momentum\nassignment to the fermion propagators in Eqs. (6) and\n(7) as a part of the definition of the model. As already\nexplained above, the integrals are then evaluated with a\nsharp cutoff on the three-momentum k.\nLet us finally remark that one might at first sight think\nit would be natural to impose the cutoff directly on the\narguments of the fermion propagators in the loop, i.e.,\non both k and k \u2212 p in Eqs. (6) and (7); this would\nroughly correspond to discretizing the coordinate space.\nNevertheless, this would destroy the expected low-energy\ndynamics of our model, based on the Nambu\u2013Goldstone\n(NG) modes of the spontaneously broken symmetry -\nthe inverse propagator (6) would develop a linearly divergent piece, proportional to |p|.\nIII.\n\nTWO-FLAVOR COLOR\nSUPERCONDUCTOR\n\nNow we apply the general formulas derived in the previous section to the particular model studied by Abuki\n[36]. It describes color superconductivity in quark matter consisting of two quark flavors, which have for simplicity equal masses and chemical potentials. The field\n\u03c8 now carries the index of the fundamental representation of the symmetry group SU(3) \u00d7 SU(2). Since the\n\nweak-coupling studies of quark matter indicate attraction between two quarks in the color-antitriplet channel, we assume that the matrices Qa have the structure\nij\n(Qa )ij\nbc = \u01eb \u01ebabc , where i, j from now on denote the flavor SU(2) indices and a, b, c the color SU(3) ones. The\norder parameter \u2206a thus transforms as an SU(2)-singlet\nand an SU(3)-antitriplet. As usual it is chosen to be\nreal and to point in the third (anti-blue) direction in the\ncolor space. In the following, we write simply \u2206 instead\nof \u22063 ; this will help us distinguish the constant order\nparameter from the fluctuation fields without having to\nintroduce further notation.\nFor this particular symmetry structure and the choice\nof vacuum, we find N = 4 and M M \u2020 = \u22062 diag(1, 1, 0)\nin the color space (in the flavor space, it is simply the\nunit matrix). So in this case, the projectors Pr simply project on the individual colors. The red and green\nquarks, participating in the pairing, are gapped, while\nthe blue quarks remain gapless. As is well known, the\nglobal SU(3) \u00d7 U(1) symmetry of the bosonized action\n(3) is broken by the Cooper pair condensate \u2206 down to\nSU(2) \u00d7 U(1)Q , operating exclusively on \u22061 and \u22062 [51].\nThe unbroken symmetry implies degeneracy between \u22061\nand \u22062 . The pair correlation matrix \u039eab is then diagonal\nand \u039e11 = \u039e22 . Moreover, \u039e11 has only the normal part,\nthanks to the existence of the unbroken U(1)Q charge.\nEvaluating explicitly the color\u2013flavor traces in Eqs. (10)\nand (11), we obtain the expressions\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\nm2 + k * (k \u2212 p)\nd3 k\nef\nef\n1 + ef\n[I23\n(k, k \u2212 p; i\u03a9N ) + I32\n(k, k \u2212 p; i\u03a9N )],\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u01ebk \u01ebk\u2212p\ne,f\n\u0015\nX Z d3 k \u0014\n1\nm2 + k * (k \u2212 p) ef\n\u2206\u2206\u2217\n\u03c733 (i\u03a9N , p) =\n1 + ef\nI12 (k, k \u2212 p; i\u03a9N ),\n+2\nG\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u01ebk \u01ebk\u2212p\ne,f\n\u0015\nX Z d3 k \u0014\nm2 + k * (k \u2212 p) ef\n2\n\u03c7\u2206\u2206\n(i\u03a9\n,\np)\n=\n\u22122\u2206\n1\n+\nef\nJ12 (k, k \u2212 p; i\u03a9N ).\nN\n33\n(2\u03c0)3\n\u01ebk \u01ebk\u2212p\n\n\u2217\n\u03c7\u2206\u2206\n11 (i\u03a9N , p)\n\n1 X\n+\n=\nG\n\nZ\n\ne,f\n\nNote that the quark loop contributing to \u039e33 is symmetric: Both propagators correspond to gapped quarks. On\nthe other hand, the loop in \u039e11 consists of one gapped\nand one ungapped propagator and the general formula\n(10) requires it to be symmetrized.\n\nA.\n\nNambu\u2013Goldstone bosons\n\nSpontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the existence\nof NG bosons, soft fluctuations of the order parameter.\nVacuum expectation value of a color antitriplet breaks\nfive generators of the color SU(3) so that we should expect five NG bosons. However, in our model where the\ncolor symmetry is just global unlike in quantum chromo-\n\ndynamics, the Noether charge corresponding to the GellMann matrix \u03bb8 acquires nonzero density. This implies\nthat there are only three NG bosons, two of which have\nquadratic dispersion law at low momentum, being the\nso-called type-II NG bosons [40, 41, 42]. These couple to\nthe two pairs of generators, (\u03bb4 , \u03bb5 ) and (\u03bb6 , \u03bb7 ), whose\ncommutator contains a \u03bb8 piece and hence has nonzero\ndensity. Therefore, they will be found in the spectrum\nof excitations of \u22061 and \u22062 . The remaining, type-I NG\nboson couples to the spontaneously broken linear combination of \u03bb3 and \u03bb8 and will be found as an excitation of\n\u22063 .\nAt zero temperature, the presence of NG modes in our\nmodel may easily be demonstrated analytically.

This\nmay be done in the standard manner, by expanding the\ncorrelation functions in powers of momentum. Let us\njust remark that at nonzero temperature but still in the\nsuperfluid phase, there are kinematical regions where the\nsharp NG peak in the pair correlation spectrum is obscured by Landau damping - the emission or absorption of the NG boson by a quark. In such regions the\nmomentum expansion of the correlation functions is not\npossible [43].\nHere we concentrate on the doublet of type-II NG\nbosons coupled to \u22061,2 , aiming to investigate the effect of\nthe expected quadratic onset of their dispersion relation.\nAt low\nfrequency and momentum, the inverse propagator\n\u2217\n\u03c7\u2206\u2206\nis\nexpanded as\n11\n\u2217\n\n2\n\u03c7\u2206\u2206\n11 (\u03c9, p) = \u2212a\u03c9 + bp .\n\n(17)\n\nThe coefficients a, b determine the low-momentum dispersion relation of the NG boson by \u03c9(p) = p2 b/a.

These\nare therefore interpreted as massless bound states of one\ngapped and one gapless quark (green and blue, and red\nand blue, respectively).\nThe correlation functions of \u22063 do not go to zero at\nvanishing frequency.

This in turn is proportional to the\ndensity of \u03bb8 as it should, for it is this non-Abelian charge\nwhich, according to general theorems [42, 44] gives rise\nto type-II NG bosons.\nB.\n\nNumerical results\n\nIn this section, we present numerical results that illustrate the general conclusions made above. In order to\nachieve concrete numbers, we use the same set of parameters as Abuki [36] so that our results in the superfluid\nphase can be matched to his for the normal phase. In\nparticular, we choose the Fermi momentum kF = 0.2m\nand a cutoff to regulate the logarithmic-divergent integrals as \u039b = 5m. The renormalized coupling GR is represented in units of the critical coupling Gc , at which the\nmass of the diquark molecule in vacuum goes to zero.\nThis signifies the instability of the vacuum itself with\nrespect to pair formation, and the onset of relativistic\n\n\f7\n2\n\n0.4\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03c111m\n0.2\n0\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n-1\n\nGc / GR\nFIG. 2: Zero-temperature density of quarks of a single paired\n(solid) and unpaired (dashed) color at zero temperature, expressed as a fraction of the fixed total density.

In the\ninset we show the tiny contribution of the particle\u2013particle\ncontinuum at negative frequencies to \u03c133 , which is absent in\n\u03c111 .\n\nPhase diagram\n\nThe dependence of the critical temperature on the\nrenormalized coupling is displayed in Fig. 1. It is instructive to compare this mean-field plot to a similar one\nachieved by Abuki and Nishida [35, 36], who included\nthe effects of Gaussian fluctuations. (To be precise, they\ncombine the mean-field Thouless criterion [45] with the\nequation for particle number that includes the contribution of bosonic quasiparticles.) It is clearly seen that as\nexpected, the mean-field approximation is reliable in the\nBCS regime (negative coupling), while it fails by about\nan order of magnitude on the BEC side. The reason is,\nof course, that the mean-field thermodynamic potential\nincludes only the contribution of the fermions, whereas in\nthe BEC regime the total number density is dominated by\nthe bosons. In the RBEC limit (that is for Gc /GR >\n\u223c 1),\nboth bosons and fermions are excited significantly, and\nthe reliability of the mean-field approximation again improves.\nIn Fig. 2 we show the contributions of the paired and\nunpaired quarks to the total density at zero temperature.\nIn the BCS limit the unpaired blue quarks form a sharp\nFermi sea, while the paired red and green quarks occupy a\nFermi sea, smeared about the Fermi surface at the scale\nof the gap. However, at Gc /GR \u2248 0.08 the chemical\npotential decreases below the fermion mass and the Fermi\nsea can no longer exist. This marks the onset of the BEC\nregime. From this point on, the whole density at zero\ntemperature is provided by the condensate of the bound\ndiquark molecules, made of red and green quarks. The\nblue quarks can only be excited thermally.\n\n2.\n\nBosonic spectrum at zero temperature and momentum\n\nAs already remarked before, the correlation function\n\u039eab is diagonal in the color\u2013flavor space, owing to the\nchoice of the order parameter \u2206 to point in the third direction in the anticolor space. Moreover, since we choose\n\u2206 real, the spectral density \u03c1ab defined by Eq. (12) is\nreal and we can use Eq. (13) to calculate it.\nIn the normal phase, the matrix \u039e is simply proportional to the unit matrix and there is a single spectral\ndensity, which has been calculated at the critical temperature by Abuki [36]. In the superfluid phase, we have\none spectral density for a = b = 1, 2 and a symmetric\n2 \u00d7 2 matrix for a = b = 3. In Fig. 3 we give a sample\nnumerical calculation of the normal parts of these spectral densities for Gc /GR = 0.5.\nSeveral comments are in order here. First, in the normal phase an isolated bound state (corresponding to a\ndiquark or antidiquark molecule) exists only on the BEC\nside of the crossover. In the superfluid phase, the NG\nbound state is present for all values of the coupling, as\nguaranteed by the Goldstone theorem. On the other\nhand, the antiboson pole appears only on the BEC side\nof the crossover, just as in the normal phase. It should\nbe stressed that the positions of the antiboson poles in\n\u03c111 and \u03c133 differ, simply because one of the bosons is\ncomposed of a gapped and an ungapped (anti)quark,\nwhile the other one of two gapped (anti)quarks. Indeed, the pole in \u03c133 occurs at a smaller (negative) \u03c9;\nthe corresponding boson is heavier. Nevertheless, for\n\n\f8\n10\n\ntiny off-diagonal (in the Nambu space) element of the correlation function matrix \u039e then induces mixing between\nthe bound boson and antiboson states, or in other words,\nbreaks the conservation of the baryon number carried\u2217\nby the quarks. Consequently, the spectral density \u03c1\u2206\u2206\n33\ndisplays, besides the expected two-particle continuum at\npositive frequency, also an analogous continuum at negative frequency,\nyet with much smaller spectral weight.\n\u2217\nIn \u03c1\u2206\u2206\n,\nthis\ncontinuum\nis absent due to the existence\n11\nof the conserved charge of the unbroken U(1)Q .\n\n0\n\nMB / m\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n3.\n\n-2\n\n-3\n\n10 0.0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nGc / GR\nFIG. 4: Absolute value of the position of the antiboson pole\nin \u03c111 (lower solid line) and \u03c133 (upper solid line) at zero\ntemperature and momentum. For comparison, we also show\nthe values of 2\u2206 (dashed) and 4\u03bc (dotted).\n\nGc /GR = 0.5 the difference is so small that it cannot\nbe seen in Fig. 3.\nApart from the presence of the isolated antiboson pole\non the BEC side of the crossover (and its absence on\nthe BCS side), the qualitative appearance of the spectrum does not change as the coupling is varied. As noted\nabove, the antiboson pole has different positions in \u03c111\nand \u03c133 . The same, of course, holds for the onset of the\ncontinuum in these spectra. As we proceed from the BCS\nto the BEC to the RBEC regime, the gap in the spectrum of red and green quarks increases, and the difference\nbetween \u03c111 and \u03c133 becomes more pronounced.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the coupling-dependence of the\ntwo antiboson masses. In the BEC regime, they are\nalmost equal and essentially determined by the chemical potential. However, this changes dramatically in the\nRBEC regime. While the pole in \u03c133 appears near the\ntwo-antiparticle continuum, now dominated by the large\nvalue of the gap, the antiboson pole in \u03c111 is still driven\nby the chemical potential. We checked numerically that\nas the temperature is increased, the mass of the antiboson in \u03c133 follows (twice) the value of the gap until\nvery close to the phase transition, where it merges with\nthe mass of the antiboson in \u03c111 . This is in agreement\nwith Ref. [36] where it was shown that in the normal\nphase, both masses (being equal) are determined by the\nchemical potential.\nAnother fact to note is the order-of-magnitude suppression of the anomalous spectral density \u03c1\u2206\u2206\n33 . This\nis due to the fact that, with the exception of the RBEC\nlimit, the gap is much smaller than other scales in the theory such as the Fermi energy or chemical potential. This\n\nBosonic spectrum at nonzero temperature and\nmomentum\n\nAt nonzero temperature and momentum the spectrum becomes more rich. The bound-state peaks acquire\nnonzero (even though tiny) width and the Landau damping appears. Having in mind that the low-energy dynamics of the system in the superfluid phase is dominated\nby the NG bosons, we display in Fig. 5 the positivefrequency parts of the spectral density \u03c111 ; each panel\ncollects the spectra for several values of the momentum.\nThe NG excitations are manifested by isolated peaks below the two-particle continuum. Comparison of spectra\nfor temperatures close to zero and to the phase transition reveals the temperature effects: The overall increase\nof the background due to thermal excitations, and the\nLandau damping, especially strong in the RBEC regime.\nWe can also see how with increasing momentum the NG\nboson peaks get closer to the continuum; at a certain\npoint they will reach the continuum and disappear from\nthe spectrum as isolated poles.\n\n4.\n\nNG boson dispersion relations\n\nIn addition to the full spectra, we also studied the dispersion relations of the NG bosons at zero temperature.\nThese can be extracted from the spectral densities and,\nin case of the type-II NG bosons, compared to the analytical low-momentum prediction from Eq. (17). The\nresult is shown in Fig. 6.\nGeneral consequences of spontaneous symmetry breaking in presence of nonzero charge density [42] require that\nthe dispersion relation of the NG boson in \u03c111 and \u03c133\nis, at low momentum, quadratic and linear, respectively.\nThe scale that defines this low-momentum region is typically set by the symmetry breaking. Above this scale,\nthe NG boson dispersion relation is no longer fixed by\nthe general properties of symmetry breaking, but rather\nis determined by the detailed dynamics of the system under consideration. In some cases, the NG boson may even\ncease to exist at high enough momentum; in our model,\nthis is reflected by its disappearance in the continuum.\nWe display the dispersion relations in a logarithmic\nscale in order to exhibit their power-law behavior.

In all graphs, the dispersion relation of the type-II NG boson in \u03c111 (solid),\nits low-momentum prediction (dotted), as well as the dispersion relation of the type-I NG boson in \u03c133 (dashed) are shown.\nThe hatched-gray and solid-gray regions denote the continuum in \u03c111 and \u03c133 , respectively. The dashed gray line indicates the\nvalue of the gap (BCS, BEC), or the chemical potential (RBEC).\n\nbroken symmetry is indeed defined by the symmetrybreaking scale, i.e., the gap. The only exception is the\nRBEC limit where the predicted quadratic dispersion of\nthe type-II NG boson is observed only below the scale of\nthe chemical potential, which is much smaller than the\ngap. This is because above the chemical potential the\nparticles and antiparticles become nearly degenerate and\n\nall effects of finite density are strongly suppressed.\nIn the BEC regime, we can even distinguish three regions of momentum with physically distinct behavior.\nFirst, at |p| <\n\u223c \u2206, the dispersions of the NG bosons are\ngoverned by the broken symmetry and match the classification into type I and type II.

This is in accord with the Bogolyubov theory\nof nonrelativistic BEC [46]. Finally, for |p| >\n\u223c m we enter\nthe relativistic regime and the dispersions become linear\nagain. (Although it cannot be seen in Fig. 6, the NG\nbosons disappear in the continuum at |p| \u2248 3.6m. So in\na linear scale, this relativistic domain actually covers a\nlarge part of the dispersion relations.)\nLet us also remark that in the BCS regime, the frequency marking the onset of the two-particle continuum\nremains strictly constant for all values of momentum displayed in Fig. 6. The reason is that only in the BCS\nregime has the dispersion of the fermionic quasiparticles\na nontrivial minimum. Consequently, for all momenta |p|\nup to the Fermi momentum, kF , the pair mode may decay into two fermions both lying on their Fermi surfaces.\nSo the continuum sets at \u03c9 = \u2206 in \u03c111 and at \u03c9 = 2\u2206 in\n\u03c133 .\nAnother hint on the range of momentum where the\nuniversal predictions of the broken symmetry apply is\nprovided by the size of the coefficients a, b defined by Eq.\n(17). In Fig. 7 we plot these coefficients against the inverse coupling. Apparently, the coefficient a which gives\nrise to the quadratic onset of the dispersion of the typeII NG boson, is suppressed in both the BCS and RBEC\nregimes. In the BCS limit, this is because the populations of the gapped and ungapped quarks are almost the\nsame and hence the density of the non-Abelian charge\n\u03bb8 goes to zero. In the RBEC limit, the reason is the\nabove-mentioned particle\u2013antiparticle symmetry.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we studied the relativistic BCS\u2013BEC\ncrossover in a class of NJL-type models. Within the\nmean-field approximation, we investigated the superfluid\nphase with particular focus on the collective bosonic excitations. The formalism we developed is general enough to\ncover all possible spin-zero pairing patterns. The calculation of the thermodynamic potential up to one bosonic\nloop splits into a kinematic and an algebraic part. The\nkinematic part is universal and the choice of the pairing\npattern enters only through the values of the gap parameters in the fermionic quasiparticle dispersion relations.\nThe algebraic part bears all necessary information about\nthe pairing pattern and can be done at once by means of\na simple trace.\nDespite the apparent generality of our model Lagrangian (1), two extensions are necessary before the\nmodel can claim phenomenological relevance for relativistic BCS\u2013BEC crossover. First, it would be desirable\nto have different chemical potentials for the individual\nfermion flavors in order to be able to account for external (e.g. magnetic) fields, or for the requirement of\noverall charge neutrality. Second, we should also include\nfermion\u2013antifermion pairing channels so that we can describe the constituent quark masses and the competition\nbetween the chiral and diquark condensates.\nAs a particular application, we described the BCS\u2013\nBEC crossover in the two-flavor color superconductor.\nWe investigated in detail the spectrum of NG bosons.\nTheir low-momentum behavior was checked to comply\nwith the general consequences of spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking at finite charge density. Concretely, the five\nbroken-symmetry generators correspond to one NG boson with a linear dispersion relation, and a doublet of\nNG bosons with a quadratic dispersion relation. This\nagrees with the general counting rules for the NG bosons\nin Lorentz-noninvariant systems [40, 42, 47].\nAt the very end it should be emphasized once again\nthat the mean-field approximation itself is not sufficient\nto describe the crossover accurately. However, the investigation of the spectrum of bosonic collective states that\nwe performed here, is to be understood as a necessary\nfirst step towards its systematic improvement.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author is indebted to H.

Rev.\nD73, 034012 (2006).\n[49] For sake of an easy comparison, we closely follow the\nnotation of Abuki [36]. The only important difference is\nthat we define the Nambu doublet with the charge conjugate spinor \u03c8 C instead of the simple Dirac conjugate\n\u03c8\u0304 T .\n[50] Suppose that we integrate in D dimensions a function\nf (k) with asymptotics f (k) \u223c 1/|k|n as |k| \u2192 \u221e, with\ninteger n. A sharp cutoff restricts the integration domain to a sphere of radius \u039b. Shifting the integration\nvariable by a small vector a is equivalent to changing\nthe integration domain by a thin shell (of size \u223c |a|).\nThe corresponding change of the integral is estimated by\nthe value of the function on the shell times its volume,\ni.e., (1/\u039bn )\u039bD\u22121 |a| = |a|\u039bD\u2212n\u22121 . This will be negligible\n(and the shift thus permitted) provided n \u2265 D.\n[51] The scalar field \u2206a is a singlet of the original flavor SU(2)\nsymmetry so that this is no more a symmetry of the\nbosonized action (3). The flavor quantum number has\nbeen \"integrated out\" together with the quarks.\n\n\f"}
