On\none hand, this theory describes many experimental data with an unprecedented accuracy. On the other hand, the mathematical substantiation of the theory is rather poor.\nAs a consequence, the issue of infinities is probably the most challenging problem in\nstandard formulation of quantum theory. As noted by Weinberg [1], \"Disappointingly\nthis problem appeared with even greater severity in the early days of quantum theory,\nand although greatly ameliorated by subsequent improvements in the theory, it remains\nwith us to the present day\". While in QED and other renormalizable theories infinities\ncan be somehow circumvented, in quantum gravity this is not possible even in lowest\norders of perturbation theory. A recent Weinberg's paper [2] is entitled \"Living with\nInfinities\".\nMathematical problems of quantum theory are discussed in a wide literature. For example, in the well known textbook [3] it is explained in details that\ninteracting quantized fields can be treated only as operatorial distributions and hence\n1\n\n\ftheir product at the same point is not well defined. One of ideas of the string theory is\nthat if a point (a zero-dimensional object) is replaced by a string (a one-dimensional\nobject) then there is a hope that infinities will be less singular.\nThere exists a wide literature aiming to solve the difficulties of the theory\nby replacing the field of complex numbers by quaternions, p-adic numbers or other\nconstructions. For example, a detailed description of a quaternionic theory is given\nin a book [4] and a modern state-of-the-art of the p-adic theory can be found, for\nexample, in Reference [5]. At present it is not clear how to overcome all the difficulties\nbut at least from the point of view of the problem of infinities a natural approach\nis to consider a quantum theory over Galois fields (GFQT). Since any Galois field is\nfinite, the problem of infinities in GFQT does not exist in principle and all operators\nare well defined. The idea of using finite fields in quantum theory has been discussed\nby several authors (see e.g., References [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]). As stated in Reference\n[12], a fundamental theory can be based either on p-adic numbers or finite fields. In\nthat case, a correspondence with standard theory will take place if the number p in\nthe p-adic theory or as a characteristic of a finite field is rather large.\nThe authors of Reference [12] and many other papers argue that fundamental quantum theory cannot be based on mathematics using standard geometrical\nobjects (such as strings, branes, etc.) at Planck distances. We believe it is rather\nobvious that the notions of continuity, differentiability, smooth manifolds etc. are\nbased on our macroscopic experience. For example, the water in the ocean can be\ndescribed by equations of hydrodynamics but we know that this is only an approximation since matter is discrete. Therefore continuous geometry probably does not\ndescribe physics even at distances much greater than the Planck length (also see the\ndiscussion below).\nIn our opinion an approach based on finite fields is very attractive for solving problems in quantum theory as well as for philosophical and aesthetical reasons.\nBelow we describe some arguments in favor of this opinion.\nThe key ingredient of standard mathematics is the notions of infinitely\nsmall and infinitely large numbers. The notion of infinitely small numbers is based\non our everyday experience that any macroscopic object can be divided by two, three\nand even a million parts. But is it possible to divide by two or three the electron\nor neutrino? It is obvious that if elementary particles exist, then division has only a\nlimited meaning. Indeed, consider, for example, the gram-molecule of water having\nthe mass 18 grams. It contains the Avogadro number of molecules 6 * 1023 . We\ncan divide this gram-molecule by ten, million, etc., but when we begin to divide\nby numbers greater than the Avogadro one, the division operation loses its sense.\nThe conclusion is that if we accept the existence of elementary particles, we should\nacknowledge that our experience based on standard mathematics is not universal.\nThe notion of infinitely large numbers is based on the belief that in principle we can operate with any large numbers. In standard mathematics this belief\nis formalized in terms of axioms (accepted without proof) about infinite sets (e.g.,\n2\n\n\fZorn's lemma or Zermelo's axiom of choice). At the same time, in the spirit of quantum theory, there should be no statements accepted without proof since only those\nstatements have physical significance, which can be experimentally verified, at least\nin principle.\nFor example, we cannot verify that a + b = b + a for any numbers a and b.\nSuppose we wish to verify that 100+200=200+100. In the spirit of quantum theory,\nit is insufficient to say that 100+200=300 and 200+100=300. To check these relationships, we should describe an experiment where they can be verified. In particular,\nwe should specify whether we have enough resources to represent the numbers 100,\n200 and 300. We believe the following observation is very important: although standard mathematics is a part of our everyday life, people typically do not realize that\nstandard mathematics is implicitly based on the assumption that one can have any\ndesirable amount of resources.\nA well known example in standard mathematics is that the interval (0, 1)\nhas the same cardinality as (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). Another example is that the function tgx gives\na one-to-one relation between the intervals (\u2212\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) and (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). Therefore one\ncan say that a part has the same number of elements as a whole. One might think\nthat this contradicts common sense but in standard mathematics the above facts\nare not treated as contradicting. Self-consistency of standard mathematics has been\ndiscussed by numerous authors. For example, the famous Goedel's incompleteness\ntheorems are interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and\nconsistent set of axioms for all of mathematics is impossible.\nSuppose now that our Universe is finite and contains only a finite number\nof elementary particles. This implies that the amount of resources cannot be infinite\nand the rules of arithmetic such as a + b = b + a for any numbers a and b, cannot be\nverified in principle. In this case it is natural to assume that there exists a number\np such that all calculations can be performed only modulo p. Note that for any\nsystem with a finite amount of resources, the only way of performing self-consistent\ncalculations is to perform them modulo some number. One might consider a quantum\ntheory over a Galois field with the characteristic p. Since any Galois field is finite,\nthe fact that arithmetic in this field is correct can be verified, at least in principle, by\nusing a finite amount of resources. Note that the proofs of the Goedel incompleteness\ntheorems are based on the fact that standard arithmetic is infinite but in our case no\ninconsistencies arise.\nThe example with division might be an indication that, in the spirit of\nReference [13], the ultimate quantum theory will be based even not on a Galois\nfield but on a finite ring (this observation was pointed out to me by Metod Saniga).\nHowever, in the present paper we will consider a case of Galois fields.\nIf one accepts the idea to replace complex numbers by a Galois field,\nthe problem arises what formulation of standard quantum theory is most convenient\nfor that purpose. A well known historical fact is that originally quantum theory has\nbeen proposed in two formalisms which seemed essentially different: the Schroedinger\n3\n\n\fwave formalism and the Heisenberg operator (matrix) formalism. It has been shown\nlater by Born, von Neumann and others that both formalisms are equivalent and, in\naddition, the path integral formalism has been developed.\nIn the spirit of the wave or path integral approach one might try to replace classical spacetime by a finite lattice which may even not be a field. In that\ncase the problem arises what the natural \"quantum of spacetime\" is and some of\nphysical quantities should necessarily have the field structure. A detailed discussion\ncan be found in Reference [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and references therein. In contrast to\nthese approaches, we propose to generalize the standard operator formulation, where\nquantum systems are described by elements of a projective complex Hilbert spaces\nand physical quantities are represented by self-adjoint operators in such spaces.\nFrom the point of view of quantum theory, any physical quantity can be\ndiscussed only in conjunction with the operator defining this quantity. However, in\ntextbooks on quantum mechanics it is usually not indicated explicitly that the quantity t is a parameter, which has the meaning of time only in the classical limit since\nthere is no operator corresponding to this quantity. The problem of how time should\nbe defined on quantum level is very difficult and is discussed in a vast literature (see\ne.g., References [16, 17, 18] and references therein). Since the 1930's it has been well\nknown [19] that, when quantum mechanics is combined with relativity, there is no\noperator satisfying all the properties of the spatial position operator. In other words,\nthe coordinate cannot be exactly measured even in situations when exact measurement is allowed by the non-relativistic uncertainty principle. In the introductory\nsection of the well-known textbook [20] simple arguments are given that for a particle\nwith mass m, the coordinate cannot be measured with the accuracy better than the\nCompton wave length h\u0304/mc. Hence, the exact measurement is possible only either in\nthe non-relativistic limit (when c \u2192 \u221e) or classical limit (when h\u0304 \u2192 0). From the\npoint of view of quantum theory, one can discuss if the coordinates of particles can be\nmeasured with a sufficient accuracy, while the notion of empty spacetime background\nfully contradicts basic principles of this theory. Indeed, the coordinates of points,\nwhich exist only in our imagination are not measurable and this problem has been\ndiscussed in a wide literature (see e.g., References [16, 17, 18, 21]). In particular, the\nquantity x in the Lagrangian density L(x) is not measurable. Note that Lagrangian\nis only an auxiliary tool for constructing Hilbert spaces and operators and this is all\nwe need to have the maximum possible information in quantum theory. After this\nconstruction has been done, one can safely forget about Lagrangian and concentrate\nhis or her efforts on calculating different observables. As stated in Reference [20],\nlocal quantum fields and Lagrangians are rudimentary notion, which will disappear\nin the ultimate quantum theory. Analogous ideas were the basis of the Heisenberg\nS-matrix program.\nIn view of the above discussion, we define GFQT as a theory where\n\u2022 Quantum states are represented by elements of a linear projective space over a\nGalois field and physical quantities are represented by linear operators in that\n4\n\n\fspace.\nAs noted in Reference [5] and references therein, in the p-adic theory\na problem arises what number fields are preferable and there should be quantum\nfluctuations not only of metrics and geometry but also of the number field. Volovich\n[12] proposed the following number field invariance principle: fundamental physical\nlaws should be invariant under the change of the number field. Analogous questions\ncan be posed in GFQT.\nIt is well known (see, e.g., standard textbooks [22, 23, 24]) that any Galois\nfield can contain only pn elements where p is prime and n is natural. Moreover, the\nnumbers p and n define the Galois field up to isomorphism. It is natural to require\nthat there should exist a correspondence between any new theory and the old one,\ni.e., at some conditions both theories should give close predictions. In particular,\nthere should exist a large number of quantum states for which the probabilistic interpretation is valid. Then, as shown in our papers [25, 26, 27], in agreement with\nReferences [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], the number p should be very large. Hence, we have\nto understand whether there exist deep reasons for choosing a particular value of p\nor it is simply an accident that our Universe has been created with this value. Since\nwe don't know the answer, we accept a simplest version of GFQT, where there exists\nonly one Galois field with the characteristic p, which is a universal constant for our\nUniverse. Then the problem arises what the value of n is. Since there should exist a\ncorrespondence between GFQT and the complex version of standard quantum theory,\na natural idea is to accept that the principal number field in GFQT is the Galois field\nanalog of complex numbers which is constructed below.\nLet Fp = Z/pZ be a residue field modulo p and Fp2 be a set of p2 elements\na+bi where a, b \u2208 Fp and i is a formal element such that i2 = \u22121. The question arises\nwhether Fp2 is a field, i.e., one can define all the arithmetic operations except division\nby zero. The definition of addition, subtraction and multiplication in Fp2 is obvious\nand, by analogy with the field of complex numbers, one could define division as\n1/(a + bi) = a/(a2 + b2 ) \u2212 ib/(a2 + b2 ) if a and b are not equal to zero simultaneously.\nThis definition can be meaningful only if a2 + b2 6= 0 in Fp . If a and b are not\nsimultaneously equal to zero, this condition can obviously be reformulated such that\n\u22121 should not be a square in Fp (or in terminology of number theory it should not be a\nquadratic residue). We will not consider the case p = 2 and then p is necessarily odd.\nThen we have two possibilities: the value of p (mod 4) is either 1 or 3. The well known\nresult of number theory is that -1 is a quadratic residue only in the former case and\na quadratic non-residue in the latter one, which implies that the above construction\nof the field Fp2 is correct only if p = 3 (mod 4).\nThe main idea of establishing the correspondence between GFQT and\nstandard theory is as follows (see References [25, 26, 27] for a detailed discussion).\nThe first step is to notice that the elements of Fp can be written not only as 0, 1, ...p\u22121\nbut also as 0, \u00b11, ..., \u00b1(p \u2212 1)/2. Such elements of Fp are called minimal residues\n[22, 23, 24]. Since the field Fp is cyclic, it is convenient to visually depict its elements\n5\n\n\fby the points of a circumference of the radius p/2\u03c0 on the plane (x, y) such that the\ndistance between neighboring elements of the field is equal to unity and the elements\n0, 1, 2,... are situated on the circumference counterclockwise. At the same time we\ndepict the elements of Z as usual, such that each element z \u2208 Z is depicted by a point\nwith the coordinates (z, 0). In Fig. 1 a part of the circumference near the origin is\ndepicted.\np-5\n\n5\n4\n\np-4\np-3\n\n3\np-2\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\np-1\n-1\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 1: Relation between Fp and the ring of integers.\nLet f be a map from Fp to Z such that f (a) has the same notation in Z\nas its minimal residue in Fp . Then for elements a, b \u2208 Fp such that |f (a)|, |f (b)| \u226a p,\naddition, subtraction and multiplication in Fp and Z are the same, i.e., f (a \u00b1 b) =\nf (a) \u00b1 f (b) and f (ab) = f (a)f (b).\nThe second step is to establish a correspondence between Hilbert spaces\nin standard theory and spaces over a Galois field in GFQT. We first note that the\nHilbert space H contains a big redundancy of elements and we do not need to know\nall of them. Since a set of finite linear combinations of basis elements with rational\ncoefficients is dense in H, with any desired accuracy we can approximate each element\nx\u0303 from H by a finite linear combination x\u0303 = c\u03031 \u1ebd1 + c\u03032 \u1ebd2 + ...c\u0303n \u1ebdn where (c\u03031 , c\u03032 , ...c\u0303n )\nare rational complex numbers. In turn, the set of such elements is redundant too.\nWe can use the fact that Hilbert spaces in quantum theory are projective: \u03c8 and\nc\u03c8 represent the same physical state, which reflects the fact that not the probability\nitself but the relative probabilities of different measurement outcomes have a physical\nmeaning. Therefore we can multiply both parts of the above equality by a common\ndenominator of the numbers (c\u03031 , c\u03032 , ...c\u0303n ). As a result, we can always assume that\nc\u0303j = \u00e3j + ib\u0303j where \u00e3j and b\u0303j are integers.\nConsider now a space over Fp2 and let x = c1 e1 + c2 e2 + ...cn en be a\ndecomposition of a state x over a basis (e1 , e2 ...) in this space. We can formally define\na scalar product (ej , ek ) such that f ((ej , ek )) = (\u1ebdj , \u1ebdk ). Then the correspondence\nbetween the states x and x\u0303 can be defined such that cj = aj + ibj (j = 1, 2...),\nf (aj ) = \u00e3j and f (bj ) = b\u0303j . If the numbers in question are much less than p then the\nstandard description and that based on GFQT give close experimental predictions.\nAt the same time, in GFQT a probabilistic interpretation is not universal and is valid\nonly when the numbers in question are much less than p.\nThe above discussion has a well known historical analogy. For many years\npeople believed that our Earth was flat and infinite, and only after a long period\n6\n\n\fof time they realized that it was finite and had a curvature. It is difficult to notice\nthe curvature when we deal only with distances much less than the radius of the\ncurvature R. Analogously one might think that the set of numbers describing physics\nhas a curvature defined by a very large number p but we do not notice it when we\ndeal only with numbers much less than p.\nSince we treat GFQT as a more general theory than standard one, it is\ndesirable not to postulate that GFQT is based on Fp2 (with p = 3 (mod 4)) because\nstandard theory is based on complex numbers but vice versa, explain the fact that\nstandard theory is based on complex numbers since GFQT is based on Fp2 . Hence,\none should find a motivation for the choice of Fp2 in GFQT. A possible motivation is\ndiscussed in References [27, 28] and in Section 10 of the present paper.\nIn standard approach to symmetries in quantum theory, the symmetry\ngroup is a group of motions of a classical spacetime background. As noted above, in\nquantum theory the spacetime background does not have a physical meaning. So a\nquestion arises whether there exists an alternative for such an approach. As already\nnoted, in standard approach, the spacetime background and Lagrangian are only auxiliary tools for constructing Hilbert spaces and operators. For calculating observables\none needs not representation operators of the symmetry group but representation\noperators of its Lie algebra, e.g., the Hamiltonian. The representation operators of\nthe group are needed only if it is necessary to calculate macroscopic transformations,\ne.g., spacetime transformations. In the approximation when classical time and space\nare good approximate parameters, the Hamiltonian and momentum operators can\nbe interpreted as ones associated with the corresponding translations, but nothing\nguarantees that this interpretation is always valid (e.g., at the very early stage of\nthe Universe). One might think that this observation is not very significant, since\ntypically symmetry groups are Lie groups and for them in many cases there exits a\none-to-one correspondence between representations of the Lie group and its Lie algebra. However, in Galois fields there is no notion of infinitesimal transformations and\nhence there is no notion of Lie group over a Galois field associated with a given Lie\nalgebra over a Galois field.\nEach system is described by a set of independent operators and they somehow commute with each other. By definition, the rules how they commute define a\nLie algebra which is treated as a symmetry algebra. Such a definition of symmetry on\nquantum level is in the spirit of Dirac's paper [29]. We believe that for understanding\nthis Dirac's idea the following example might be useful. If we define how the energy\nshould be measured (e.g., the energy of bound states, kinetic energy etc.), we have a\nfull knowledge about the Hamiltonian of our system. In particular, we know how the\nHamiltonian should commute with other operators. In standard theory the Hamiltonian is also interpreted as an operator responsible for evolution in time, which is\nconsidered as a classical macroscopic parameter. According to principles of quantum\ntheory, self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces represent observables but there is no\nrequirement that parameters defining a family of unitary transformations generated\n7\n\n\fby a self-adjoint operator are eigenvalues of another self-adjoint operator. A well\nknown example from standard quantum mechanics is that if Px is the x component\nof the momentum operator then the family of unitary transformations generated by\nPx is exp(iPx x/h\u0304) where x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) and such parameters can be identified with\nthe spectrum of the position operator. At the same time, the family of unitary transformations generated by the Hamiltonian H is exp(\u2212iHt/h\u0304) where t \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e) and\nthose parameters cannot be identified with a spectrum of a self-adjoint operator on\nthe Hilbert space of our system. In the relativistic case the parameters x can be\nformally identified with the spectrum of the Newton-Wigner position operator [19]\nbut it is well known that this operator does not have all the required properties for\nthe position operator. So, although the operators exp(iPx x/h\u0304) and exp(\u2212iHt/h\u0304) are\nwell defined in standard theory, their physical interpretation as translations in space\nand time is not always valid.\nLet us now discuss how one should define the notion of elementary particles. Although particles are observables and fields are not, in the spirit of quantum\nfield theory (QFT), fields are more fundamental than particles, and a possible definition is as follows [30]: It is simply a particle whose field appears in the Lagrangian.\nIt does not matter if it's stable, unstable, heavy, light-if its field appears in the Lagrangian then it's elementary, otherwise it's composite. Another approach has been\ndeveloped by Wigner in his investigations of unitary irreducible representations (IRs)\nof the Poincare group [31]. In view of this approach, one might postulate that a\nparticle is elementary if the set of its wave functions is the space of a unitary IR of\nthe symmetry group or Lie algebra in the given theory. In standard theory the Lie\nalgebras are usually real and one considers their representations in complex Hilbert\nspaces.\nIn view of the above remarks, and by analogy with standard quantum\ntheory one might define the elementary particle in GFQT as follows. Let A be a Lie\nalgebra over Fp which is treated as a symmetry algebra. A particle is elementary if\nthe set of its states forms an IR of A in F (pn ). Representations of Lie algebras in\nspaces with nonzero characteristic are called modular representations. There exists a\nwell developed theory of such representations. One of the well known results is the\nZassenhaus theorem [32] that any modular IR is finite dimensional. In Section 6 we\npropose another definition of elementary particle.\nAs argued in References [25, 26, 27], standard theories based on de Sitter\n(dS) algebra so(1,4) or anti de Sitter (AdS) algebra so(2,3) can be generalized to\ntheories based on a Galois field while there are problems with the generalization of\nthe theory based on Poincare algebra. The reasons are the following. It is clear\nthat in theories based on Galois fields there can be no dimensional quantities and all\nphysical quantities are discrete. In standard dS or AdS invariant theories all physical\nquantities are dimensionless and discrete in units h\u0304/2 = c = 1 while in Poincare\ninvariant theory the energy and momentum necessarily have a continuous spectrum.\nFrom the formal point of view, the representation operators of the Poincare algebra\n8\n\n\fcan also be chosen dimensionless, e.g., in Planck units. In Poincare invariant theories\nover a Galois field one has to choose a quantum of length. If this quantum is the\nPlanck distance then the quantum of mass will be the Planck mass, which is much\ngreater than the masses of elementary particles.\nThe existing astronomical data (see, e.g., Reference [33, 34]) indicate that\nthe cosmological constant is small and positive. This is an argument in favor of so(1,4)\nvs. so(2,3). On the other hand, in QFT and its generalizations (string theory, Mtheory etc.) a theory based on so(1,4) encounters serious difficulties and the choice of\nso(2,3) is preferable (see e.g., Reference [35]). IRs of the so(2,3) algebra have much in\ncommon with IRs of Poincare algebra. In particular, in IRs of the so(2,3) algebra the\nAdS Hamiltonian is either strictly positive or strictly negative and a supersymmetric generalization is possible. In standard theory, representations of the so(2,3) and\nso(1,4) algebras differ only in a way how Hermiticity conditions are imposed. Since\nin GFQT the notions of probability and Hermiticity are only approximate, modular\nrepresentations of those algebras differ only in a way how we establish a correspondence with standard theory when p is large. For these reasons in the present paper\nfor illustration of what happens when complex numbers are replaced by a Galois field\nwe assume that A is the modular analog of the algebra so(2,3).\nIt is well known [22, 23, 24] that the field Fpn has n \u2212 1 nontrivial automorphisms. Therefore, if n is arbitrary, a formal scalar product and Hermiticity can\nbe defined in different ways. We do not assume from the beginning that n = 2 and\np = 3 (mod 4). Our results do not depend on the explicit choice of the scalar product and z\u0304 is used to denote an element obtained from z \u2208 Fpn by an automorphism\ncompatible with the scalar product in question.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sections 2-4 we construct modular\nIRs describing elementary particles in GFQT, their quantization and physical meaning\nare discussed in Sections 5-9, the spin-statistics theorem is discussed in Section 10 and\na supersymmetric generalization is discussed in Section 11. Although some results\nrequire extensive calculations, they involve only finite sums in Galois fields. For this\nreason all the results can be reproduced even by readers who previously did not have\npractice in calculations with Galois fields. A more detailed description of calculations\ncan be found in Reference [27].\n\n2\n\nModular IRs of the sp(2) Algebra\n\nThe key role in constructing modular IRs of the so(2,3) algebra is played by modular\nIRs of the sp(2) subalgebra. They are described by a set of operators (a\u2032 , a\", h)\nsatisfying the commutation relations\n[h, a\u2032 ] = \u22122a\u2032\n\n[h, a\"] = 2a\" [a\u2032 , a\"] = h\n\n9\n\n(1)\n\n\fThe Casimir operator of the second order for the algebra (1) has the form\nK = h2 \u2212 2h \u2212 4a\"a\u2032 = h2 + 2h \u2212 4a\u2032 a\"\n\n(2)\n\nWe first consider representations with the vector e0 such that\na\u2032 e0 = 0,\n\nhe0 = q0 e0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere q0 \u2208 Fp and f (q0 ) > 0. Recall that we consider the representation in a linear\nspace over Fpk where k is a natural number (see the discussion in Section 1). Denote\nen = (a\")n e0 . Then it follows from Equations (2) and (3), that\nhen = (q0 + 2n)en ,\n\nKen = q0 (q0 \u2212 2)en\n\na\u2032 a\"en = (n + 1)(q0 + n)en\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nOne can consider analogous representations in standard theory. Then q0\nis a positive real number, n = 0, 1, 2, ... and the elements en form a basis of the IR.\nIn this case e0 is a vector with a minimum eigenvalue of the operator h (minimum\nweight) and there are no vectors with the maximum weight. The operator h is positive\ndefinite and bounded below by the quantity q0 . For these reasons the above modular\nIRs can be treated as modular analogs of such standard IRs that h is positive definite.\nAnalogously, one can construct modular IRs starting from the element e\u20320\nsuch that\na\"e\u20320 = 0, he\u20320 = \u2212q0 e\u20320\n(6)\nand the elements e\u2032n can be defined as e\u2032n = (a\u2032 )n e\u20320 . Such modular IRs are analogs of\nstandard IRs where h is negative definite. However, in the modular case Equations\n(3) and (6) define the same IRs. This is clear from the following consideration.\nThe set (e0 , e1 , ...eN ) will be a basis of IR if a\"ei 6= 0 for i < N and\na\"eN = 0. These conditions must be compatible with a\u2032 a\"eN = 0. Therefore, as\nfollows from Equation (5), N is defined by the condition q0 + N = 0 in Fp . As a\nresult, if q0 is one of the numbers 1, ...p \u2212 1 then N = p \u2212 q0 and the dimension of IR\nequals p \u2212 q0 + 1 (in agreement with the Zassenhaus theorem [32]). It is easy to see\nthat eN satisfies Equation (6) and therefore it can be identified with e\u20320 .\nLet us forget for a moment that the eigenvalues of the operator h belong to\nFp and will treat them as integers. Then, as follows from Equation (4), the eigenvalues\nare\nq0 , q0 + 2, ..., 2p \u2212 2 \u2212 q0 , 2p \u2212 q0 .\nTherefore, if f (q0 ) > 0 and f (q0 ) \u226a p, the maximum value of q0 is equal to 2p \u2212 q0 ,\ni.e., it is of order 2p.\n\n10\n\n\f3\n\nModular IRs of the so(2,3) Algebra\n\nStandard IRs of the so(2,3) algebra relevant for describing elementary particles have\nbeen considered by several authors. The description in this section is a combination of\ntwo elegant ones given in Reference [36] for standard IRs and Reference [37] for modular IRs. In standard theory, the commutation relations between the representation\noperators in units h\u0304/2 = c = 1 are given by\n[M ab , M cd ] = \u22122i(g ac M bd + g bd M cd \u2212 g ad M bc \u2212 g bc M ad )\n\n(7)\n\nwhere a, b, c, d take the values 0,1,2,3,5 and the operators M ab are antisymmetric. The\ndiagonal metric tensor has the components g 00 = g 55 = \u2212g 11 = \u2212g 22 = \u2212g 33 = 1.\nIn these units the spin of fermions is odd, and the spin of bosons is even. If s is the\nparticle spin then the corresponding IR of the su(2) algebra has the dimension s + 1.\nNote that our definition of the AdS symmetry on quantum level does\nnot involve the cosmological constant at all. It appears only if one is interested in\ninterpreting results in terms of the AdS spacetime or in the Poincare limit. Since all\nthe operators M ab are dimensionless in units h\u0304/2 = c = 1, the de Sitter invariant\nquantum theories can be formulated only in terms of dimensionless variables. As\nnoted in Section 1, this is a necessary requirement for a theory, which is supposed to\nhave a physical generalization to the case of Galois fields. At the same time, since\nPoincare invariant theories do not have such generalizations, one might expect that\nquantities which are dimensionful in units h\u0304/2 = c = 1 are not fundamental. This is\nin the spirit of Mirmovich's hypothesis [38] that only quantities having the dimension\nof the angular momentum can be fundamental.\nIf a modular IR is considered in a linear space over Fp2 with p = 3 (mod 4)\nthen Equation (7) is also valid. However, as noted in Section 1, we consider modular\nIRs in linear spaces over Fpk where k is arbitrary. In this case it is convenient to work\nwith another set of ten operators. Let (a\u2032j , aj \", hj ) (j = 1, 2) be two independent sets\nof operators satisfying the commutation relations for the sp(2) algebra\n[hj , a\u2032j ] = \u22122a\u2032j\n\n[hj , aj \"] = 2aj \" [a\u2032j , aj \"] = hj\n\n(8)\n\nThe sets are independent in the sense that for different j they mutually commute\nwith each other. We denote additional four operators as b\u2032 , b\", L+ , L\u2212 . The operators\nL3 = h1 \u2212 h2 , L+ , L\u2212 satisfy the commutation relations of the su(2) algebra\n[L3 , L+ ] = 2L+\n\n[L3 , L\u2212 ] = \u22122L\u2212\n\n[L+ , L\u2212 ] = L3\n\n(9)\n\nwhile the other commutation relations are as follows\n[a\u20321 , b\u2032 ] = [a\u20322 , b\u2032 ] = [a1 \", b\"] = [a2 \", b\"] = [a\u20321 , L\u2212 ] = [a1 \", L+ ] = [a\u20322 , L+ ] =\n[a2 \", L\u2212 ] = 0 [hj , b\u2032 ] = \u2212b\u2032 [hj , b\"] = b\" [h1 , L\u00b1 ] = \u00b1L\u00b1 [h2 , L\u00b1 ] = \u2213L\u00b1\n[b\u2032 , b\"] = h1 + h2 [b\u2032 , L\u2212 ] = 2a\u20321 [b\u2032 , L+ ] = 2a\u20322 [b\", L\u2212 ] = \u22122a2 \"\n[b\", L+ ] = \u22122a1 \" [a\u20321 , b\"] = [b\u2032 , a2 \"] = L\u2212 [a\u20322 , b\"] = [b\u2032 , a1 \"] = L+\n[a\u20321 , L+ ] = [a\u20322 , L\u2212 ] = b\u2032 [a2 \", L+ ] = [a1 \", L\u2212 ] = \u2212b\"\n(10)\n11\n\n\fAt first glance these relations might seem rather chaotic but in fact they are very\nnatural in the Weyl basis of the so(2,3) algebra.\nIn spaces over Fp2 with p = 3 (mod 4) the relation between the above sets\nof ten operators is\nM10 = i(a1 \" \u2212 a\u20321 \u2212 a2 \" + a\u20322 ) M15 = a2 \" + a\u20322 \u2212 a1 \" \u2212 a\u20321\nM20 = a1 \" + a2 \" + a\u20321 + a\u20322 M25 = i(a1 \" + a2 \" \u2212 a\u20321 \u2212 a\u20322 )\nM12 = L3 M23 = L+ + L\u2212 M31 = \u2212i(L+ \u2212 L\u2212 )\nM05 = h1 + h2 M35 = b\u2032 + b\" M30 = \u2212i(b\" \u2212 b\u2032 )\n\n(11)\n\nand therefore the sets are equivalent. However, the relations (8-10) are more general\nsince they can be used when the representation space is a space over Fpk with an\narbitrary k.\nWe use the basis in which the operators (hj , Kj ) (j = 1, 2) are diagonal.\nHere Kj is the Casimir operator (2) for algebra (a\u2032j , aj \", hj ). For constructing IRs\nwe need operators relating different representations of the sp(2)\u00d7sp(2) algebra. By\nanalogy with References [36, 37], one of the possible choices is as follows\nA++ = b\"(h1 \u2212 1)(h2 \u2212 1) \u2212 a1 \"L\u2212 (h2 \u2212 1) \u2212 a2 \"L+ (h1 \u2212 1) + a1 \"a2 \"b\u2032\nA+\u2212 = L+ (h1 \u2212 1) \u2212 a1 \"b\u2032 A\u2212+ = L\u2212 (h2 \u2212 1) \u2212 a2 \"b\u2032 A\u2212\u2212 = b\u2032\n\n(12)\n\nWe consider the action of these operators only on the space of minimal sp(2)\u00d7sp(2)\nvectors, i.e., such vectors x that a\u2032j x = 0 for j = 1, 2, and x is the eigenvector of\nthe operators hj . If x is a minimal vector such that hj x = \u03b1j x then A++ x is the\nminimal eigenvector of the operators hj with the eigenvalues \u03b1j + 1, A+\u2212 x - with the\neigenvalues (\u03b11 + 1, \u03b12 \u2212 1), A\u2212+ x - with the eigenvalues (\u03b11 \u2212 1, \u03b12 + 1), and A\u2212\u2212 x\n- with the eigenvalues \u03b1j \u2212 1.\nBy analogy with References [36, 37], we require the existence of the vector\ne0 satisfying the conditions\na\u2032j e0 = b\u2032 e0 = L+ e0 = 0 hj e0 = qj e0\n\n(j = 1, 2)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere qj \u2208 Fp , f (qj ) > 0 for j = 1, 2 and f (q1 \u2212 q2 ) \u2265 0. It is well known (see e.g.,\nReference [27]) that M 05 = h1 + h2 is the AdS analog of the energy operator. As\nfollows from Equations (8) and (10), the operators (a\u20321 , a\u20322 , b\u2032 ) reduce the AdS energy\nby two units. Therefore e0 is an analog the state with the minimum energy which can\nbe called the rest state, and the spin in our units is equal to the maximum value of the\noperator L3 = h1 \u2212 h2 in that state. For these reasons we use s to denote q1 \u2212 q2 and\nm to denote q1 + q2 . In standard classification [36], the massive case is characterized\nby the condition q2 > 1 and the massless one-by the condition q2 = 1. There\nalso exist two exceptional IRs discovered by Dirac [39] (Dirac singletons). They are\ncharacterized by the conditions m = 1, s = 0 and m = 2, s = 1. In this section we\nwill consider the massive case while the singleton and massless cases will be considered\nin the next section.\n12\n\n\fAs follows from the above remarks, the elements\nenk = (A++ )n (A\u2212+ )k e0\n\n(14)\n\nrepresent the minimal sp(2)\u00d7sp(2) vectors with the eigenvalues of the operators h1\nand h2 equal to Q1 (n, k) = q1 + n \u2212 k and Q2 (n, k) = q2 + n + k, respectively. It can\nbe shown by a direct calculation that\nA\u2212\u2212 A++ enk = (n + 1)(m + n \u2212 2)(q1 + n)(q2 + n \u2212 1)enk\n\n(15)\n\nA+\u2212 A\u2212+ enk = (k + 1)(s \u2212 k)(q1 \u2212 k \u2212 2)(q2 + k \u2212 1)enk\n\n(16)\n\nAs follows from these expressions, in the massive case k can assume only\nthe values 0, 1, ...s and in standard theory n = 0, 1, ...\u221e. However, in the modular\ncase n = 0, 1, ...nmax where nmax is the first number for which the r.h.s. of Equations\n(15) becomes zero in Fp . Therefore nmax = p + 2 \u2212 m.\nThe full basis of the representation space can be chosen in the form\ne(n1 n2 nk) = (a1 \")n1 (a2 \")n2 enk\n\n(17)\n\nIn standard theory n1 and n2 can be any natural numbers. However, as follows\nfrom the results of the preceding section, Equation (8) and the properties of the A\noperators,\nn1 = 0, 1, ...N1 (n, k) n2 = 0, 1, ...N2 (n, k)\nN1 (n, k) = p \u2212 q1 \u2212 n + k N2 (n, k) = p \u2212 q2 \u2212 n \u2212 k\n\n(18)\n\nAs a consequence, the representation is finite dimensional in agreement with the\nZassenhaus theorem [32] (moreover, it is finite since any Galois field is finite).\nLet us assume additionally that the representation space is supplied by\na scalar product (see Section 1). The element e0 can always be chosen such that\n(e0 , e0 ) = 1. Suppose that the representation operators satisfy the Hermiticity condi\u2032\n\u2032\ntions L\u2217+ = L\u2212 , aj\u2217 = aj \", b \u2217 = b\" and h\u2217j = hj . Then, as follows from Equation (11),\nin a special case when the representation space is a space over Fp2 with p = 3 (mod 4),\nthe operators M ab are Hermitian as it should be. By using Equations (8-16), one can\nshow by a direct calculation that the elements e(n1 n2 nk) are mutually orthogonal\nwhile the quantity\nNorm(n1 n2 nk) = (e(n1 n2 nk), e(n1 n2 nk))\n\n(19)\n\nNorm(n1 n2 nk) = F (n1 n2 nk)G(nk)\n\n(20)\n\ncan be represented as\n\n13\n\n\fwhere\nF (n1 n2 nk) = n1 !(Q1 (n, k) + n1 \u2212 1)!n2 !(Q2 (n, k) + n2 \u2212 1)!\nG(nk) = {(q2 + k \u2212 2)!n!(m + n \u2212 3)!(q1 + n \u2212 1)!(q2 + n \u2212 2)!k!s!}\n{(q1 \u2212 k \u2212 2)![(q2 \u2212 2)!]3 (q1 \u2212 1)!(m \u2212 3)!(s \u2212 k)!\n[Q1 (n, k) \u2212 1][Q2 (n, k) \u2212 1]}\u22121\n\n(21)\n\nIn standard Poincare and AdS theories there also exist IRs with negative\nenergies. They can be constructed by analogy with positive energy IRs. Instead of\nEquation (13) one can require the existence of the vector e\u20320 such that\naj \"e\u20320 = b\"e\u20320 = L\u2212 e\u20320 = 0 hj e\u20320 = \u2212qj e\u20320\n\n(e\u20320 , e\u20320 ) 6= 0 (j = 1, 2)\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the quantities q1 , q2 are the same as for positive energy IRs. It is obvious\nthat positive and negative energy IRs are fully independent since the spectrum of\nthe operator M 05 for such IRs is positive and negative, respectively. However, the\nmodular analog of a positive energy IR characterized by q1 , q2 in Equation (13), and\nthe modular analog of a negative energy IR characterized by the same values of q1 , q2\nin Equation (22) represent the same modular IR. This is the crucial difference between\nstandard quantum theory and GFQT, and a proof is given below.\nLet e0 be a vector satisfying Equation (13). Denote N1 = p \u2212 q1 and\nN2 = p \u2212 q2 . Our goal is to prove that the vector x = (a1 \")N1 (a2 \")N2 e0 satisfies the\nconditions (22), i.e., x can be identified with e\u20320 .\nAs follows from the definition of N1 , N2 , the vector x is the eigenvector\nof the operators h1 and h2 with the eigenvalues \u2212q1 and \u2212q2 , respectively, and, in\naddition, it satisfies the conditions a1 \"x = a2 \"x = 0. Let us prove that b\"x = 0.\nSince b\" commutes with the aj \", we can write b\"x in the form\nb\"x = (a1 \")N1 (a2 \")N2 b\"e0\n\n(23)\n\nAs follows from Equations (10) and (13), a\u20322 b\"e0 = L+ e0 = 0 and b\"e0 is the eigenvector of the operator h2 with the eigenvalue q2 +1. Therefore, b\"e0 is the minimal vector\nof the sp(2) IR which has the dimension p \u2212 q2 = N2 . Therefore (a2 \")N2 b\"e0 = 0 and\nb\"x = 0.\nThe next stage of the proof is to show that L\u2212 x = 0. As follows from\nEquation (10) and the definition of x,\nL\u2212 x = (a1 \")N1 (a2 \")N2 L\u2212 e0 \u2212 N1 (a1 \")N1 \u22121 (a2 \")N2 b\"e0\n\n(24)\n\nWe have already shown that (a2 \")N2 b\"e0 = 0, and therefore it is sufficient to prove\nthat the first term in the r.h.s. of Equation (24) is equal to zero. As follows from\nEquations (10) and (13), a\u20322 L\u2212 e0 = b\u2032 e0 = 0, and L\u2212 e0 is the eigenvector of the\noperator h2 with the eigenvalue q2 + 1. Therefore (a2 \")N2 L\u2212 e0 = 0 and the proof is\ncompleted.\n14\n\n\fLet us assume for a moment that the eigenvalues of the operators h1 and\nh2 should be treated not as elements of Fp but as integers. Then, as follows from the\nconsideration in the preceding section, if f (qj ) \u226a p (j=1,2) then one modular IR of\nthe so(2,3) algebra corresponds to a standard positive energy IR in the region where\nthe energy is positive and much less than p. At the same time, it corresponds to an\nIR with the negative energy in the region where the AdS energy is close to 4p but\nless than 4p.\n\n4\n\nMassless Particles and Dirac Singletons\n\nThose cases can be considered by analogy with the massive one. The case of Dirac\nsingletons is especially simple. As follows from Equations (15) and (16), if m =\n1, s = 0 then the only possible value of k is k = 0 and the only possible values of n\nare n = 0, 1 while if m = 2, s = 1 then the only possible values of k are k = 0, 1 and\nthe only possible value of n is n = 0. This result does not depend on the value of p\nand therefore it is valid in both, standard theory and GFQT. In this case the only\ndifference between standard and modular cases is that in the former n1 , n2 = 0, 1, ...\u221e\nwhile in the latter the quantities n1 , n2 are in the range defined by Equation (20).\nThe singleton IRs are indeed exceptional since the value of n in them\ndoes not exceed 1 and therefore the impression is that singletons are two-dimensional\nobjects, not three-dimensional ones as usual particles. However, the singleton IRs\nhave been obtained in the so(2,3) theory without reducing the algebra. Dirac has\nentitled his paper [39] \"A Remarkable Representation of the 3 + 2 de Sitter Group\".\nBelow we argue that in GFQT the singleton IRs are even more remarkable than in\nstandard theory.\nIf m = 1, s = 0 then q1 = q2 = 1/2. In GFQT these relations should be\ntreated as q1 = q2 = (p + 1)/2. Analogously, if m = 2, s = 1 then q1 = 3/2, q2 = 1/2\nand in GFQT q1 = (p + 3)/2, q2 = (p + 1)/2. Therefore when the values of n1 and n2\nare small, the values of h1 and h2 are extremely large since they are of order of p/2.\nAs follows from the results of Sections 2 and 3. those values are much less than p\nonly when n1 and n2 are of order p/4. This might be an indication why singletons are\nnot observable: because there is no region when all the quantum numbers are much\nless than p. At the end of this section we will discuss relations between singleton and\nmassless IRs.\nConsider now the massless case. We will follow our derivation in Reference\n[40]. When q2 = 1, it is more convenient to deal not with the A-operators defined in\nEquation (12) but with the B-operators defined as\nB ++ = b\" \u2212 a1 \"L\u2212 (h1 \u2212 1)\u22121 \u2212 a2 \"L+ (h2 \u2212 1)\u22121 + a1 \"a2 \"b\u2032 [(h1 \u2212 1)(h2 \u2212 1)]\u22121\nB +\u2212 = L+ \u2212 a1 \"b\u2032 (h1 \u2212 1)\u22121 B \u2212+ = L\u2212 \u2212 a2 \"b\u2032 (h2 \u2212 1)\u22121 B \u2212\u2212 = b\u2032 (25)\nIf e0 is defined as in Equation (13), then by, analogy with the massive case, we can\n15\n\n\fdefine the vectors enk as\n\nenk = (B ++ )n (B \u2212+ )k e0\n\n(26)\n\nbut a problem arises how to define the action of the operators B ++ and B \u2212+ on e0\nwhich is the eigenvector of the operator h2 with the eigenvalue q2 = 1. A possible way\nto resolve ambiguities 0/0 in matrix elements is to write q2 in the form q2 = 1 + \u01eb and\ntake the limit \u01eb \u2192 0 at the final stage of computations. This confirms a well known\nfact that analytical methods can be very useful in problems involving only integers.\nIt is also possible to justify the results by using only integers (or rather elements of\nthe Galois field in question), but we will not dwell on this .\nBy using the above prescription, we require that\nB ++ e0 = [b\" \u2212 a1 \"L\u2212 (h1 \u2212 1)\u22121 ]e0\n\nB \u2212+ e0 = L\u2212 e0\n\n(27)\n\nif s 6= 0 (and thus h1 6= 1), and\nB ++ e0 = b\"e0\n\nB +\u2212 e0 = B \u2212+ e0 = 0\n\n(28)\n\nif s = 0. One can directly verify that, as follows from Equations (8-10)\nB \u2212+ B ++ (h1 \u2212 1) = B ++ B \u2212+ (h1 \u2212 2) B +\u2212 B ++ (h2 \u2212 1) = B ++ B +\u2212 (h2 \u2212 2)(29)\nand, in addition, as follows from Equation (13)\nB +\u2212 enk = b(n, k)en,k\u22121\n\nB \u2212\u2212 enk = a(n, k)en\u22121,k\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\na(n, k) =\n\nn(n+s\u22121)(n+s)(n\u22121)\n(n+s\u2212k\u22121)(n+k\u22121)\n\nb(n, k) =\n\nk(s+1\u2212k)(k\u22121)\nn+k\u22121\n\n(31)\n\nAs follows from these expressions, the elements enk form a basis in the space of\nminimal sp(2)\u00d7sp(2) vectors, and our next goal is to determine the range of the\nnumbers n and k.\nConsider first the quantity b(0, k) = k(s + 1 \u2212 k) and let kmax be the\nmaximum value of k. For consistency we should require that if kmax 6= 0 then k = kmax\nis the greatest value of k such that b(0, k) 6= 0 for k = 1, ...kmax . We conclude that k\ncan take only the values of 0, 1, ..s.\nLet now nmax (k) be the maximum value of n at a given k. For consistency\nwe should require that if nmax (k) 6= 0 then nmax (k) is the greatest value of n such\nthat a(n, k) 6= 0 for n = 1, ...nmax (k). As follows from Equation (31), a(1, k) = 0 for\nk = 1, ..s \u2212 1 if such values of k exist (i.e., when s \u2265 2), and a(n, k) = n(s + n) if\nk = 0 or k = s. We conclude that at k = 1, ...s \u2212 1, the quantity n can take only\nthe value n = 0 while at k = 0 or k = s, the possible values of n are 0, 1, ...nmax\nwhere nmax = p \u2212 s \u2212 1. Recall that in the preceding section we have obtained\nnmax = p + 2 \u2212 m for the massive case. Since m = 2q2 + s and q2 > 1 in the massive\n16\n\n\fcase, we conclude that the values of nmax in the massive and massless cases are given\nby different formulas.\nAccording to Standard Model, only massless Weyl particles can be fundamental elementary particles in Poincare invariant theory. Therefore a problem arises\nwhether the above results can be treated as analogs of Weyl particles in standard\nand modular versions of AdS invariant theory. Several authors investigated dS and\nAdS analogs of Weyl particles proceeding from covariant equations on the dS and\nAdS spaces, respectively. For example, the authors of Reference [41] have shown that\nWeyl particles arise only when the dS or AdS symmetries are broken to the Lorentz\nsymmetry. The results of Reference [36] and the above results in the modular case\nmake it possible to treat AdS Weyl particles from the point of view of IRs.\nIt is well known that Poincare invariant theory is a special case of AdS\none obtained as follows. We introduce the AdS radius R and define P \u03bc = M \u03bc5 /2R\n(\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3). Then in the approximation when R is very large, the operators M \u03bc5\nare very large but their ratio is finite, we obtain Poincare invariant theory where\nP \u03bc are the four-momentum operators. This procedure is called contraction and for\nthe first time it has been discussed in Reference [42]. Since the mass is the lowest\nvalue of the energy in both, Poincare and AdS invariant theories, the mass m in the\nAdS case and the standard Poincare mass m\u2032 are related as m/2R = m\u2032 . The AdS\nmass is dimensionless while the Poincare mass has the dimension length\u22121 . Since the\nPoincare symmetry is a special case of the AdS one, this fact is in agreement with\nthe observation in Section 1 that dimensionful quantities cannot be fundamental. Let\nlC (m\u2032 ) be the Compton wave length for the particle with the mass m\u2032 . Then one\nmight think that, in view of the relation m = 2R/lC (m\u2032 ), the AdS mass shows how\nmany Compton wave lengths are contained in the interval (0, 2R). However, such\nan interpretation of the AdS mass means that we wish to interpret a fundamental\nquantity m in terms of our experience based on Poincare invariant theory. As already\nnoted, the value of m does not depend on any quantities having the dimension length\nor length\u22121 and it is the Poincare mass which implicitly depends on R. Let us\nassume for estimations that the value of R is 1028 cm. Then even the AdS mass of\nthe electron is of order 1039 and this might be an indication that the electron is not\na true elementary particle. Moreover, the present upper level for the photon mass is\n10\u221218 ev which seems to be an extremely tiny quantity. However, the corresponding\nAdS mass is of order 1015 and so even the mass which is treated as extremely small\nin Poincare invariant theory might be very large in AdS invariant theory.\nSince m = 2q2 + s, the corresponding Poincare mass will be zero when\nR \u2192 \u221e not only when q2 = 1 but when q2 is any finite number. So a question arises\nwhy only the case q2 = 1 is treated as massless. In Poincare invariant theory, Weyl\nparticles are characterized not only by the condition that their mass is zero but also\nby the condition that they have a definite helicity. In standard case the minimum\nvalue of the AdS energy for massless IRs with positive energy is Emin = 2 + s when\nn = 0. In contrast with the situation in Poincare invariant theory, where massless\n17\n\n\fparticles cannot be in the rest state, the massless particles in the AdS theory do have\nrest states and, as shown above, the value of the z projection of the spin in such\nstates can be \u2212s, \u2212s + 2, ...s as usual. However, we have shown that for any value\nof energy greater than Emin , when n 6= 0, the spin state is characterized only by\nhelicity, which can take the values either s when k = 0 or \u2212s when k = s, i.e., we\nhave the same result as in Poincare invariant theory. Note that in contrast with IRs\nof the Poincare and dS algebras, standard IRs describing particles in AdS invariant\ntheory belong to the discrete series of IRs and the energy spectrum in them is discrete:\nE = Emin , Emin +2, ...\u221e. Therefore, strictly speaking, rest states do not have measure\nzero as in Poincare and dS invariant theories. Nevertheless, the probability that the\nenergy is exactly Emin is extremely small and therefore the above results show that\nthe case q2 = 1 indeed describes AdS analogs of Weyl particles.\nBy analogy with the massive case, one can show that the full basis of the\nrepresentation space also can be described by Equation (17) and that one massless\nmodular IR is a modular analog of both, standard massless positive and negative\nenergy IRs. For singleton IRs it is also possible to prove that if a vector e\u20320 is defined\nby the same formulas as in Section 3, it satisfies Equation (22). However, singleton\nIRs obviously cannot be treated as modular analogs of standard positive and negative\nenergy IRs.\nIn Reference [43] entitled \"One Massless Particle Equals Two Dirac Singletons\", it is shown that the tensor product of two singleton IRs is a massless IR.\nThis follows from the following facts. If we take two singleton IRs then the tensor\nproduct of the corresponding vectors e0 (see Equation (13)) satisfies Equation (13)\nand is characterized by q2 = 1, i.e., precisely by the condition defining a massless IR.\nThe value of spin in this IR equals 0 for the tensor product of two singletons with\nm = 1, s = 0, 1 (i.e., 1/2 in standard units) for the tensor product of two singleton\nIRs with m = 1, s = 0 and m = 2, s = 1 and 2 (i.e., 1 in standard units) for the\ntensor product of two singletons with m = 2, s = 1. Therefore the tensor product\nof two singleton IRs indeed contains a massless IR and, as a consequence of a special\nnature of singleton IRs, it does not contain other IRs. This might be an indication\nthat fundamental particles are even not Weyl ones but Dirac singletons. We believe\nthat in GFQT the singleton IRs are even more remarkable than in standard theory for\nthe following reasons. If we accept that Weyl particles are composite states of Dirac\nsingletons then a question arises why Weyl particles are stable and singletons have\nnot been observed yet although in standard theory they are characterized by small\nvalues of all quantum numbers. However, in GFQT at least two singleton quantum\nnumbers are of order p, i.e., extremely large and this might be an explanation why\nthey are not observable in situations where all energies in question are much less than\np. We believe this is an interesting observation that when the values of h1 and h2 are\nof order p/2, their sum is small since it is calculated modulo p. In standard theory,\nif an additive quantity for a two-particle system is not equal to a sum of the corresponding single-particle quantities, it is said that the particles interact. Therefore\n18\n\n\fthe fact that a sum of two values of order p/2 is not of order p but much less than\np can be treated as a very strong interaction although from the formal point of view\nno interaction between the singletons has been introduced.\n\n5\n\nMatrix Elements of Representation Operators\n\nIn what follows, we will discuss the massive case but the same results are valid in the\nsingleton and massless cases. The matrix elements of the operator A are defined as\nX\nA(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 ; n1 n2 nk)e(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\n(32)\nAe(n1 n2 nk) =\nn\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all possible values of (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 ). One can explicitly\ncalculate matrix elements for all the representation operators and the results are as\nfollows.\nh1 e(n1 n2 nk) = [Q1 (n, k) + 2n1 ]e(n1 n2 nk)\nh2 e(n1 n2 nk) = [Q2 (n, k) + 2n2 ]e(n1 n2 nk)\n\n(33)\n\na\u20321 e(n1 n2 nk) = n1 [Q1 (n, k) + n1 \u2212 1]e(n1 \u2212 1, n2 nk)\na1 \"e(n1 n2 nk) = e(n1 + 1, n2 nk)\na\u20322 e(n1 n2 nk) = n2 [Q2 (n, k) + n2 \u2212 1]e(n1 , n2 \u2212 1, nk)\na2 \"e(n1 n2 nk) = e(n1 , n2 + 1, nk)\n\n(34)\n\nb\"e(n1 n2 nk) = {[Q1 (n, k) \u2212 1][Q2 (n, k) \u2212 1]}\u22121\n[k(s + 1 \u2212 k)(q1 \u2212 k \u2212 1)(q2 + k \u2212 2)e(n1 , n2 + 1, n, k \u2212 1) +\nn(m + n \u2212 3)(q1 + n \u2212 1)(q2 + n \u2212 2)e(n1 + 1, n2 + 1, n \u2212 1, k) +\ne(n1 , n2 , n + 1, k) + e(n1 + 1, n2 , n, k + 1)]\n\n(35)\n\nb\u2032 e(n1 n2 nk) = {[Q1 (n, k) \u2212 1][Q2 (n, k) \u2212 1]}\u22121 [n(m + n \u2212 3)\n(q1 + n \u2212 1)(q2 + n \u2212 2)(q1 + n \u2212 k + n1 \u2212 1)(q2 + n + k + n2 \u2212 1)\ne(n1 n2 , n \u2212 1, k) + n2 (q1 + n \u2212 k + n1 \u2212 1)e(n1 , n2 \u2212 1, n, k + 1) +\nn1 (q2 + n + k + n2 \u2212 1)k(s + 1 \u2212 k)(q1 \u2212 k \u2212 1)(q2 + k \u2212 2)\ne(n1 \u2212 1, n2 , n, k \u2212 1) + n1 n2 e(n1 \u2212 1, n2 \u2212 1, n + 1, k)]\n\n(36)\n\nL+ e(n1 n2 nk) = {[Q1 (n, k) \u2212 1][Q2 (n, k) \u2212 1]}\u22121 {(q2 + n + k + n2 \u2212 1)\n[k(s + 1 \u2212 k)(q1 \u2212 k \u2212 1)(q2 + k \u2212 2)e(n1 n2 n, k \u2212 1) +\nn(m + n \u2212 3)(q1 + n \u2212 1)(q2 + n \u2212 2)e(n1 + 1, n2 , n \u2212 1, k)] +\nn2 [e(n1 , n2 \u2212 1, n + 1, k) + e(n1 + 1, n2 \u2212 1, n, k + 1)]}\n\n(37)\n\n19\n\n\fL\u2212 e(n1 n2 nk) = {[Q1 (n, k) \u2212 1][Q2 (n, k) \u2212 1]}\u22121 {n1 [k(s + 1 \u2212 k)\n(q1 \u2212 k \u2212 1)(q2 + k \u2212 2)e(n1 \u2212 1, n2 n, k \u2212 1) + e(n1 \u2212 1, n2 , n + 1, k)]\n+(q1 + n \u2212 k + n1 \u2212 1)[e(n1 n2 n, k + 1) + n(m + n \u2212 3)\n(q1 + n \u2212 1)(q2 + n \u2212 2)e(n1 , n2 + 1, n \u2212 1, k)]}\n\n(38)\n\nWe will always use a convention that e(n1 n2 nk) is a null vector if some of the numbers\n(n1 n2 nk) are not in the range described above.\nThe important difference between standard and modular IRs is that in the\nlatter the trace of each representation operator is equal to zero while in the former this\nis obviously not the case (for example, the energy operator is positive definite for IRs\ndefined by Equation (13) and negative definite for IRs defined by Equation (22)). For\nthe operators (a\u2032j , aj \", L\u00b1 , b\u2032 , b\") the validity of this statement is clear immediately:\nsince they necessarily change one of the quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk), they do not\ncontain nonzero diagonal elements at all. The proof for the diagonal operators h1\nand h2 is as follows. For each IR of the sp(2) algebra with the \"minimal weight\" q0\nand the dimension N + 1, the eigenvalues of the operator h are (q0 , q0 + 2, ...q0 + 2N).\nThe sum of these eigenvalues equals zero in Fp since q0 + N = 0 in Fp (see the\npreceding section). Therefore we conclude that for any representation operator A\nX\nA(n1 n2 nk, n1 n2 nk) = 0\n(39)\nn1 n2 nk\n\nThis property is very important for investigating a new symmetry between particles\nand antiparticles in the GFQT which is discussed in the subsequent section.\n\n6\n\nQuantization and AB Symmetry\n\nLet us first recall how the Fock space is defined in standard theory. Let a(n1 n2 nk) be\nthe operator of particle annihilation in the state described by the vector e(n1 n2 nk).\nThen the adjoint operator a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 has the meaning of particle creation in that\nstate. Since we do not normalize the states e(n1 n2 nk) to one, we require that the\noperators a(n1 n2 nk) and a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 should satisfy either the anticommutation relations\n{a(n1 n2 nk), a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 } = Norm(n1 n2 nk)\u03b4n1 n\u20321 \u03b4n2 n\u20322 \u03b4nn\u2032 \u03b4kk\u2032\n\n(40)\n\nor the commutation relations\n[a(n1 n2 nk), a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 ] = Norm(n1 n2 nk)\u03b4n1 n\u20321 \u03b4n2 n\u20322 \u03b4nn\u2032 \u03b4kk\u2032\n\n(41)\n\nIn standard theory the representation describing a particle and its antiparticle are fully independent and therefore quantization of antiparticles should\nbe described by other operators. If b(n1 n2 nk) and b(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 are operators of the\n20\n\n\fantiparticle annihilation and creation in the state e(n1 n2 nk) then by analogy with\nEquations (40) and (41)\n{b(n1 n2 nk), b(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 } = Norm(n1 n2 nk)\u03b4n1 n\u20321 \u03b4n2 n\u20322 \u03b4nn\u2032 \u03b4kk\u2032\n\n(42)\n\n[b(n1 n2 nk), b(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 ] = Norm(n1 n2 nk)\u03b4n1 n\u20321 \u03b4n2 n\u20322 \u03b4nn\u2032 \u03b4kk\u2032\n\n(43)\n\nfor anticommutation or commutation relations, respectively. In this case it is assumed\nthat in the case of anticommutation relations all the operators (a, a\u2217 ) anticommute\nwith all the operators (b, b\u2217 ) while in the case of commutation relations they commute\nwith each other. It is also assumed that the Fock space contains the vacuum vector\n\u03a60 such that\na(n1 n2 nk)\u03a60 = b(n1 n2 nk)\u03a60 = 0 \u2200 n1 , n2 , n, k\n(44)\nThe Fock space in standard theory can now be defined as a linear combination of all elements obtained by the action of the operators (a\u2217 , b\u2217 ) on the vacuum\nvector, and the problem of second quantization of representation operators can be\nformulated as follows. Let (A1 , A2 ....An ) be representation operators describing IR\nof the AdS algebra. One should replace them by operators acting in the Fock space\nsuch that the commutation relations between their images in the Fock space are the\nsame as for original operators (in other words, we should have a homomorphism of Lie\nalgebras of operators acting in the space of IR and in the Fock space). We can also\nrequire that our map should be compatible with the Hermitian conjugation in both\nspaces. It is easy to verify that a possible solution satisfying all the requirements is\nas follows. Taking into account the fact that the matrix elements satisfy the proper\ncommutation relations, the operators Ai in the quantized form\nP\nAi = Ai (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 , n1 n2 nk)[a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 a(n1 n2 nk) +\nb(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 b(n1 n2 nk)]/Norm(n1 n2 nk)\n(45)\nsatisfy the commutation relations (8-10). We will not use special notations for operators in the Fock space since in each case it will be clear whether the operator in\nquestion acts in the space of IR or in the Fock space.\nA well known problem in standard theory is that the quantization procedure does not define the order of the annihilation and creation operators uniquely.\nFor example, another possible solution is\nP\nAi = \u2213 Ai (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 , n1 n2 nk)[a(n1 n2 nk)a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 +\nb(n1 n2 nk)b(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 ]/Norm(n1 n2 nk)\n(46)\nfor anticommutation and commutation relations, respectively. The solutions (45)\nand (46) are different since the energy operators M 05 in these expressions differ by\nan infinite constant. In standard theory the solution (45) is selected by imposing an\n21\n\n\fadditional requirement that all operators should be written in the normal form where\nannihilation operators precede creation ones. Then the vacuum has zero energy and\nEquation (46) should be rejected. Such a requirement does not follow from the theory.\nIdeally there should be a procedure which correctly defines the order of operators from\nfirst principles.\nIn standard theory there also exist neutral particles. In that case there is\nno need to have two independent sets of operators (a, a\u2217 ) and (b, b\u2217 ), and Equation\n(45) should be written without the (b, b\u2217 ) operators. The problem of neutral particles\nin GFQT is discussed in Section 10.\nWe now proceed to quantization in the modular case. The results of\nSection 3 show that one modular IR corresponds to two standard IRs with the positive\nand negative energies, respectively. This indicates to a possibility that one modular\nIR describes a particle and its antiparticle simultaneously. However, we don't know\nyet what should be treated as a particle and its antiparticle in the modular case.\nWe have a description of an object such that (n1 n2 nk) is the full set of its quantum\nnumbers which take the values described in the preceding section.\nWe now assume that a(n1 n2 nk) in GFQT is the operator describing annihilation of the object with the quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk) regardless of whether\nthe numbers are physical or nonphysical. Analogously a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 describes creation\nof the object with the quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk). If these operators anticommute\nthen they satisfy Equation (40) while if they commute then they satisfy Equation\n(41). Then, by analogy with standard case, the operators\nX\nAi =\nAi (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 , n1 n2 nk)a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 a(n1 n2 nk)/Norm(n1 n2 nk)\n(47)\nsatisfy the commutation relations (8-10). In this expression the sum is taken over all\npossible values of the quantum numbers in the modular case.\nIn the modular case the solution can be taken not only as in Equation (47)\nbut also as\nX\nAi = \u2213\nAi (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 , n1 n2 nk)a(n1 n2 nk)a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 /Norm(n1 n2 nk)\n(48)\nfor the cases of anticommutators and commutators, respectively. However, as follows\nfrom Equations (39-41), the solutions (47) and (48) are the same. Therefore in the\nmodular case there is no need to impose an artificial requirement that all operators\nshould be written in the normal form.\nThe problem with the treatment of the (a, a\u2217 ) operators is as follows.\nWhen the values of (n1 n2 n) are much less than p, the modular IR corresponds to\nstandard positive energy IR and therefore the (a, a\u2217 ) operator can be treated as those\ndescribing the particle annihilation and creation, respectively. However, when the\nAdS energy is negative, the operators a(n1 n2 nk) and a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 become unphysical\nsince they describe annihilation and creation, respectively, in the unphysical region\nof negative energies.\n22\n\n\fLet us recall that at any fixed values of n and k, the quantities n1 and\nn2 can take only the values described in Equation (18) and the eigenvalues of the\noperators h1 and h2 are given by Q1 (n, k) + 2n1 and Q2 (n, k) + 2n2 , respectively. As\nfollows from the results of Section 3, the first IR of the sp(2) algebra has the dimension\nN1 (n, k) + 1 and the second IR has the dimension N2 (n, k) + 1. If n1 = N1 (n, k)\nthen it follows from Equation (18) that the first eigenvalue is equal to \u2212Q1 (n, k)\nin Fp , and if n2 = N2 (n, k) then the second eigenvalue is equal to \u2212Q2 (n, k) in\nFp . We use \u00f11 to denote N1 (n, k) \u2212 n1 and \u00f12 to denote N2 (n, k) \u2212 n2 . Then it\nfollows from Equation (18) that e(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) is the eigenvector of the operator h1 with\nthe eigenvalue \u2212(Q1 (n, k) + 2n1 ) and the eigenvector of the operator h2 with the\neigenvalue \u2212(Q2 (n, k) + 2n2 ).\nStandard theory implicitly involves the idea that creation of the antiparticle with positive energy can be treated as annihilation of the corresponding particle\nwith negative energy and annihilation of the antiparticle with positive energy can be\ntreated as creation of the corresponding particle with negative energy. In GFQT we\ncan implement this idea explicitly. Namely, we can define the operators b(n1 n2 nk) and\nb(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 in such a way that they will replace the (a, a\u2217 ) operators if the quantum\nnumbers are unphysical. In addition, if the values of (n1 n2 n) are much less than p,\nthe operators b(n1 n2 nk) and b(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 should be interpreted as physical operators\ndescribing annihilation and creation of antiparticles, respectively.\nIn GFQT the (b, b\u2217 ) operators cannot be independent of the (a, a\u2217 ) operators since the latter are defined for all possible quantum numbers. Therefore the\n(b, b\u2217 ) operators should be expressed in terms of the (a, a\u2217 ) ones. We can implement\nthe above idea if the operator b(n1 n2 nk) is defined in such a way that it is proportional\nto a(\u00f11 , \u00f12 , n, k)\u2217 and hence b(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 is proportional to a(\u00f11 , \u00f12 , n, k).\nSince Equation (21) should now be considered in Fp , it follows from the\nwell known Wilson theorem (p \u2212 1)! = \u22121 in Fp (see e.g., [22, 23, 24]) that\nF (n1 n2 nk)F (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) = (\u22121)s\n\n(49)\n\nWe now define the b-operators as\na(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 = \u03b7(n1 n2 nk)b(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)/F (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u03b7(n1 n2 nk) is some function. As a consequence,\na(n1 n2 nk) = \u03b7\u0304(n1 n2 nk)b(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\u2217 /F (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\nb(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 = a(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)F (n1 n2 nk)/\u03b7\u0304(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\nb(n1 n2 nk) = a(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\u2217 F (n1 n2 nk)/\u03b7(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\n\n(51)\n\nEquations (50) and (51) define a relation between the sets (a, a\u2217 ) and\n(b, b\u2217 ). Although our motivation was to replace the (a, a\u2217 ) operators by the (b, b\u2217 )\nones only for the nonphysical values of the quantum numbers, we can consider this\n23\n\n\fdefinition for all the values of (n1 n2 nk). The transformation described by Equations\n(50) and (51) can also be treated as a special case of the Bogolubov transformation\ndiscussed in a wide literature on many-body theory (see e.g., Chapter 10 in Reference\n[44] and references therein).\nWe have not discussed yet what exact definition of the physical and nonphysical quantum numbers should be. This problem will be discussed in Section 7.\nHowever, one might accept\nPhysical-nonphysical states assumption: Each set of quantum numbers\n(n1 n2 nk) is either physical or unphysical. If it is physical then the set (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\nis unphysical and vice versa.\nWith this assumption we can conclude from Equations (50) and (51) that\nif some operator a is physical then the corresponding operator b\u2217 is unphysical and\nvice versa while if some operator a\u2217 is physical then the corresponding operator b is\nunphysical and vice versa.\nWe have no ground to think that the set of the (a, a\u2217 ) operators is more\nfundamental than the set of the (b, b\u2217 ) operators and vice versa. Therefore the question arises whether the (b, b\u2217 ) operators satisfy the relations (41) or (42) in the case of\nanticommutation or commutation relations, respectively and whether the operators\nAi (see Equation (47)) have the same form in terms of the (a, a\u2217 ) and (b, b\u2217 ) operators.\nIn other words, if the (a, a\u2217 ) operators in Equation (47) are expressed in terms of the\n(b, b\u2217 ) ones then the problem arises whether\nX\nAi =\nAi (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 , n1 n2 nk)b(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 )\u2217 b(n1 n2 nk)/Norm(n1 n2 nk)\n(52)\nis valid. It is natural to accept the following\nDefinition of the AB symmetry: If the (b, b\u2217 ) operators satisfy Equation\n(42) in the case of anticommutators or Equation (43) in the case of commutators and\nall the representation operators (47) in terms of the (b, b\u2217 ) operators have the form\n(52) then it is said that the AB symmetry is satisfied.\nTo prove the AB symmetry we will first investigate whether Equations\n(42) and (43) follow from Equations (40) and (41), respectively. As follows from\nEquations (49-51), Equation (42) follows from Equation (40) if\n\u03b7(n1 n2 nk)\u03b7\u0304(n1 , n2 , nk) = (\u22121)s\n\n(53)\n\nwhile Equation (43) follows from Equation (41) if\n\u03b7(n1 n2 nk)\u03b7\u0304(n1 , n2 , nk) = (\u22121)s+1\n\n(54)\n\nWe now represent \u03b7(n1 n2 nk) in the form\n\u03b7(n1 n2 nk) = \u03b1f (n1 n2 nk)\n\n(55)\n\nwhere f (n1 n2 nk) should satisfy the condition\nf (n1 n2 nk)f \u0304(n1 , n2 , nk) = 1\n24\n\n(56)\n\n\fThen \u03b1 should be such that\n\u03b1\u1fb1 = \u00b1(\u22121)s\n\n(57)\n\nwhere the plus sign refers to anticommutators and the minus sign to commutators,\nrespectively. If the normal spin-statistics connection is valid, i.e., we have anticommutators for odd values of s and commutators for even ones then the r.h.s. of Equation\n(57) equals -1 while in the opposite case it equals 1. In Section 10, Equation (57) is\ndiscussed in detail and for now we assume that solutions of this relation exist.\nA direct calculation using the explicit expressions (33-38) for the matrix\nelements shows that if \u03b7(n1 n2 nk) is given by Equation (55) and\nf (n1 n2 nk) = (\u22121)n1 +n2 +n\n\n(58)\n\nthen the AB symmetry is valid regardless of whether the normal spin-statistics connection is valid or not (the details of calculations can be found in Reference [27]).\nAs noted in Section 1, elementary particle can be defined either in the\nspirit of QFT or in terms of IRs. We now can give another definition: a particle is\nelementary if its operators (a, a\u2217 ) (or (b, b\u2217 )) are used for describing our system in the\nFock space. A difference between this definition and that in terms of IRs is clear in\nthe case of massless particles: they are described by IRs but are treated as elementary\nor not depending on whether the description in the Fock space involves the (a, a\u2217 )\noperators for the massless particles or singletons.\n\n7\n\nPhysical and Nonphysical States\n\nThe operator a(n1 n2 nk) can be the physical annihilation operator only if it annihilates\nthe vacuum vector \u03a60 . Then if the operators a(n1 n2 nk) and a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 satisfy the\nrelations (40) or (41), the vector a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 \u03a60 has the meaning of the one-particle\nstate. The same can be said about the operators b(n1 n2 nk) and b(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 . For\nthese reasons in standard theory it is required that the vacuum vector should satisfy\nthe conditions (44). Then the elements\n\u03a6+ (n1 n2 nk) = a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 \u03a60\n\n\u03a6\u2212 (n1 n2 nk) = b(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 \u03a60\n\n(59)\n\nhave the meaning of one-particle states for particles and antiparticles, respectively.\nHowever, if one requires the condition (44) in GFQT, then it is obvious\nfrom Equations (50) and Equation (51) that the elements defined by Equation (59) are\nnull vectors. Note that in standard approach the AdS energy is always greater than m\nwhile in GFQT the AdS energy is not positive definite. We can therefore try to modify\nEquation (44) as follows. Suppose that Physical-nonphysical states assumption (see\nSection 6) can be substantiated. Then we can break the set of elements (n1 n2 nk) into\ntwo nonintersecting parts with the same number of elements, S+ and S\u2212 , such that\n\n25\n\n\fif (n1 n2 nk) \u2208 S+ then (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) \u2208 S\u2212 and vice versa. Then, instead of the condition\n(44) we require\na(n1 n2 nk)\u03a60 = b(n1 n2 nk)\u03a60 = 0 \u2200 (n1 , n2 , n, k) \u2208 S+\n\n(60)\n\nIn that case the elements defined by Equation (59) will indeed have the meaning of\none-particle states for (n1 n2 nk) \u2208 S+ .\nIt is clear that if we wish to work with the full set of elements (n1 n2 nk)\nthen, as follows from Equations (50) and (51), the operators (b, b\u2217 ) are redundant and\nwe can work only with the operators (a, a\u2217 ). However, if one works with the both\nsets, (a, a\u2217 ) and (b, b\u2217 ) then such operators can be independent of each other only for\na half of the elements (n1 n2 nk).\nRegardless of how the sets S+ and S\u2212 are defined, the Physical-nonphysical\nstates assumption cannot be consistent if there exist quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk) such\nthat n1 = \u00f11 and n2 = \u00f12 . Indeed, in that case the sets (n1 n2 nk) and (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) are\nthe same what contradicts the assumption that each set (n1 n2 nk) belongs either to\nS+ or S\u2212 .\nSince the replacements n1 \u2192 \u00f11 and n2 \u2192 \u00f12 change the signs of the\neigenvalues of the h1 and h2 operators (see Section 6), the condition that that n1 =\n\u00f11 and n2 = \u00f12 should be valid simultaneously implies that the eigenvalues of the\noperators h1 and h2 should be equal to zero simultaneously. Recall that (see Section\n2) if one considers IR of the sp(2) algebra and treats the eigenvalues of the diagonal\noperator h not as elements of Fp but as integers, then they take the values of q0 , q0 +\n2, ...2p \u2212 q0 \u2212 2, 2p \u2212 q0 . Therefore the eigenvalue is equal to zero in Fp only if it is\nequal to p when considered as an integer. Since m = q1 + q2 and the AdS energy\nis E = h1 + h2 , the above situation can take place only if the energy considered as\nan integer is equal to 2p. It now follows from Equation (11) that the energy can\nbe equal to 2p only if m is even. Since s = q1 \u2212 q2 , we conclude that m can be\neven if and only if s is even. In that case we will necessarily have quantum numbers\n(n1 n2 nk) such that the sets (n1 n2 nk) and (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) are the same and therefore the\nPhysical-nonphysical states assumption is not valid. On the other hand, if s is odd\n(i.e., half-integer in the usual units) then there are no quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk)\nsuch that the sets (n1 n2 nk) and (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) are the same.\nOur conclusion is as follows: If the separation of states should be valid for\nany quantum numbers then the spin s should be necessarily odd. In other words, if the\nnotion of particles and antiparticles is absolute then elementary particles can have\nonly a half-integer spin in the usual units.\nIn view of the above observations it seems natural to implement the\nPhysical-nonphysical states assumption as follows. If the quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk)\nare such that m + 2(n1 + n2 + n) < 2p then the corresponding state is physical and\nbelongs to S+ , otherwise the state is unphysical and belongs to S\u2212 . However, one\ncannot guarantee that there are no other reasonable implementations.\n\n26\n\n\f8\n\nAdS Symmetry Breaking\n\nIn view of the above discussion, our next goal is the following. We should take the\noperators in the form (47) and replace the (a, a\u2217 ) operators by the (b, b\u2217 ) ones only\nif (n1 n2 nk) \u2208 S\u2212 . Then a question arises whether we will obtain the standard result\n(45) where a sum is taken only over values of (n1 n2 nk) \u2208 S+ . The fact that we\nhave proved the AB symmetry does not guarantee that this is the case since the AB\nsymmetry implies that the replacement has been made for all the quantum numbers,\nnot only half of them. However, the derivation of the AB symmetry shows that for\nthe contribution of such quantum numbers that (n1 n2 nk) \u2208 S+ and (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 ) \u2208\nS+ we will indeed have the result (45) up to some constants. This derivation also\nguarantees that if we consider the action of the operators on states described by\nphysical quantum numbers and the result of the action also is a state described by\nphysical quantum numbers then on such states the correct commutation relations\nare satisfied. A problem arises whether they will be satisfied for transitions between\nphysical and nonphysical quantum numbers.\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLet A(a1 ) be the secondly quantized operator corresponding to a1 and\nA(a\"1 ) be the secondly quantized operator corresponding to a\"1 . Consider the action\nof these operators on the state \u03a6 = a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 \u03a60 such that (n1 n2 nk) \u2208 S+ but\n(n1 + 1, n2 nk) \u2208 S\u2212 . As follows from Equations (8) and (33), we should have\n\u2032\n\n[A(a1 ), A(a\"1 )]\u03a6 = [Q1 (n, k) + 2n1 ]\u03a6\n\n(61)\n\nAs follows from Equations (34) and (50), A(a\"1 )\u03a6 = a(n1 + 1, n2 nk)\u2217 \u03a60 . Since (n1 +\n1, n2 nk) \u2208 S\u2212 , we should replace a(n1 + 1, n2 nk)\u2217 by an operator proportional to\nb(\u00f11 \u2212 1, \u00f12 nk) and then, as follows from Equation (44), A(a\"1 )\u03a6 = 0. Now, by using\nEquations (34) and (50), we get\n\u2032\n\n[A(a1 ), A(a\"1 )]\u03a6 = n1 [Q1 (n, k) + n1 \u2212 1]\u03a6\n\n(62)\n\nEquations (61) and (62) are incompatible with each other and we conclude that our\nprocedure breaks the AdS symmetry for transitions between physical and nonphysical\nstates.\nWe conclude that if, by analogy with standard theory, one wishes to interpret modular IRs of the dS algebra in terms of particles and antiparticles then\nthe commutation relations of the dS algebra will be broken. This does not mean\nthat such a possibility contradicts the existing knowledge since they will be broken\nonly at extremely high dS energies of order p. At the same time, a possible point\nof view is that since we started from the symmetry algebra, we should not sacrifice\nsymmetry because we don't know other ways of interpreting IRs. The mathematical\nstructure of IRs indicates that they describe objects characterized by quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk) and breaking this set of quantum numbers into S+ and S\u2212 is only an\napproximation valid at not very high energies. If we accept this point of view then\nthere is no need to require that if quantum numbers (n1 , n2 nk) are physical then the\n27\n\n\fnumbers (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) are unphysical and vice versa. For example, we can exclude such\nquantum numbers that n1 = \u00f11 and n2 = \u00f12 and therefore a description in terms of\nparticles and antiparticles will be valid in the case of even s too.\n\n9\n\nDirac Vacuum Energy Problem\n\nThe Dirac vacuum energy problem is discussed in practically every textbook on QFT.\nIn its simplified form it can be described as follows. Suppose that the energy spectrum\nis discrete and n is the quantum number enumerating the states. Let E(n) be the\nenergy in the state n. Consider the electron-positron field. As a result of quantization\none gets for the energy operator\nX\nE(n)[a(n)\u2217 a(n) \u2212 b(n)b(n)\u2217 ]\n(63)\nE=\nn\n\nwhere a(n) is the operator of electron annihilation in the state n, a(n)\u2217 is the operator\nof electron creation in the state n, b(n) is the operator of positron annihilation in the\nstate n and b(n)\u2217 is the operator of positron creation in the state n. It follows\nfrom this expression that only anticommutation relations are possible since otherwise\nthe energy of positrons will be negative. However, if anticommutation relations are\nassumed, it follows from Equation (63) that\nX\nE={\nE(n)[a(n)\u2217 a(n) + b(n)\u2217 b(n)]} + E0\n(64)\nn\n\nwhere E0 is some infinite negative constant. Its presence was a motivation for developing Dirac's hole theory. In the modern approach it is usually required that the\nvacuum energy should be zero. This can be obtained by assuming that all operators\nshould be written in the normal form. However, this requirement is not quite consistent since the result of quantization is Equation (63) where the positron operators\nare not written in that form (see also the discussion in Section 6).\nConsider now the AdS energy operator M 05 = h1 +h2 in GFQT. As follows\nfrom Equations (33) and (48)\nX\nM 05 =\n[m + 2(n1 + n2 + n)]a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 a(n1 n2 nk)/Norm(n1 n2 nk)\n(65)\nwhere the sum is taken over all possible quantum numbers (n1 n2 nk). As noted in the\npreceding section, one could try to interpret this operator in terms of particles and\nantiparticles by replacing only the nonphysical (a, a\u2217 ) operators by the physical (b, b\u2217 )\nones. Then M 05 will be represented in terms of physical operators only. As noted\nin the preceding section, it is not clear whether such a procedure is physical or not.\nNevertheless it is interesting to see whether the vacuum energy can be calculated in\nGFQT and whether this will shed light on the problem of infinities in standard QFT.\n28\n\n\fAs follows from Equations (49-51) and (55-57)\nP\nM 05 = { S+ [m + 2(n1 + n2 + n)][a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 a(n1 n2 nk) +\nb(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 b(n1 n2 nk)]/Norm(n1 n2 nk)} + Evac\nwhere the vacuum energy is given by\nX\n[m + 2(n1 + n2 + n)]\nEvac = \u2213\n\n(66)\n\n(67)\n\nS+\n\nin the cases when the (b, b\u2217 ) operators anticommute and commute, respectively. Note\nthat in contrast with standard theory, we have represented the result for M 05 in the\nnormal form for both, commutation and anticommutation relations. For definiteness,\nwe will perform calculations for the case when the operators anticommute and the\nvalue of s is odd.\nConsider first the sum in Equation (67) when the values of n and k are\nfixed. It is convenient to distinguish the cases s > 2k and s < 2k. If s > 2k then, as\nfollows from Equation (18), the maximum value of n1 is such that m + 2(n + n1 ) is\nalways less than 2p. For this reason all the values of n1 contribute to the sum, which\ncan be written as\nX\n\np\u2212q1 \u2212n+k\n\nS1 (n, k) = \u2212\n\n[(m + 2n + 2n1 ) + (m + 2n + 2n1 + 2) + ... + (2p \u2212 1)] (68)\n\nn1 =0\n\nA simple calculation shows that the result can be represented as\nS1 (n, k) =\n\np\u22121\nX\n\nX\n\nn+(m\u22123)/2\n\nn21\n\nn1 =1\n\n\u2212\n\nX\n\n(s\u22121)/2\u2212k\n\nn21\n\n\u2212\n\nn1 =1\n\nn21\n\n(69)\n\nn1 =1\n\nwhere the last sum should be taken into account only if (s \u2212 1)/2 \u2212 k \u2265 1.\nThe first sum in this expression equals (p \u2212 1)p(2p \u2212 1)/6 and, since we\nassume that p 6= 2 and p 6= 3, this quantity is zero in Fp . As a result, S1 (n, k) is\nrepresented as a sum of two terms such that the first one depends only on n and\nthe second - only on k. Note also that the second term is absent if s = 1, i.e., for\nparticles with the spin 1/2 in the usual units.\nAnalogously, if s < 2k the result is\nX\n\nn+(m\u22123)/2\n\nS2 (n, k) = \u2212\n\nX\n\nk\u2212(s+1)/2\n\nn22\n\n\u2212\n\nn2 =1\n\nn22\n\n(70)\n\nn2 =1\n\nwhere the second term should be taken into account only if k \u2212 (s + 1)/2 \u2265 1.\nWe now should calculate the sum\nX\n\n(s\u22121)/2\n\nS(n) =\n\nS1 (n, k) +\n\nk=0\n\ns\nX\nk=(s+1)/2\n\n29\n\nS2 (n, k)\n\n(71)\n\n\fand the result is\n)[2(n + m\u22121\n)2 \u2212\nS(n) = \u2212(s + 1)(n + m\u22121\n2\n2\n3(n + m\u22121\n) + 1]/6 \u2212 (s \u2212 1)(s + 1)2 (s + 3)/96\n2\n\n(72)\n\nSince the value of n is in the range [0, nmax ], the final result is\nEvac =\n\nnX\nmax\n\nS(n) = (m \u2212 3)(s \u2212 1)(s + 1)2 (s + 3)/96\n\n(73)\n\nn=0\n\nsince in the massive case nmax = p + 2 \u2212 m.\nOur final conclusion in this section is that if s is odd and the separation of\nstates into physical and nonphysical ones is accomplished as in Section 7 then Evac = 0\nonly if s = 1 ( i.e., s = 1/2 in the usual units). This result shows that since the rules\nof arithmetic in Galois fields are different from that for real numbers, it is possible\nthat quantities which are infinite in standard theory will be zero in GFQT.\n\n10\n\nNeutral Particles and Spin-Statistics Theorem\n\nIn this section we will discuss the relation between the (a, a\u2217 ) and (b, b\u2217 ) operators\nonly for all quantum numbers (i.e., in the spirit of the AB-symmetry) and therefore\nthe results are valid regardless of whether the separation of states into S+ and S\u2212\ncan be justified or not (see the discussion in Section 8).\nThe nonexistence of neutral elementary particles in GFQT is one of the\nmost striking differences between GFQT and standard theory. One could give the\nfollowing definition of neutral particle:\n\u2022 i) it is a particle coinciding with its antiparticle\n\u2022 ii) it is a particle which does not coincide with its antiparticle but they have\nthe same properties\nIn standard theory only i) is meaningful since neutral particles are described by real\n(not complex) fields and this condition is required by Hermiticity. One might think\nthat the definition ii) is only academic since if a particle and its antiparticle have\nthe same properties then they are indistinguishable and can be treated as the same.\nHowever, the cases i) and ii) are essentially different from the operator point of view.\nIn the case i) only the (a, a\u2217 ) operators are sufficient for describing the operators (45)\nin standard theory. This is the reflection of the fact that the real field has the number\nof degrees of freedom twice as less as the complex field. On the other hand, in the\ncase ii) both (a, a\u2217 ) and (b, b\u2217 ) operators are required, i.e., in standard theory such a\nsituation is described by a complex field. Nevertheless, the case ii) seems to be rather\nodd: it implies that there exists a quantum number distinguishing a particle from\n30\n\n\fits antiparticle but this number is not manifested experimentally. We now consider\nwhether the conditions i) or ii) can be implemented in GFQT.\nSince each operator a is proportional to some operator b\u2217 and vice versa\n(see Equations (50) and (51)), it is clear that if the particles described by the operators (a, a\u2217 ) have a nonzero charge then the particles described by the operators\n(b, b\u2217 ) have the opposite charge and the number of operators cannot be reduced.\nHowever, if all possible charges are zero, one could try to implement i) by requiring\nthat each b(n1 n2 nk) should be proportional to a(n1 n2 nk) and then a(n1 n2 nk) will be\nproportional to a(\u00f11 , \u00f12 , nk)\u2217 . In this case the operators (b, b\u2217 ) will not be needed at\nall.\nSuppose, for example, that the operators (a, a\u2217 ) satisfy the commutation\nrelations (41). In that case the operators a(n1 n2 nk) and a(n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 ) should commute\nif the sets (n1 n2 nk) and (n\u20321 n\u20322 n\u2032 k \u2032 ) are not the same. In particular, one should have\n[a(n1 n2 nk), a(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)] = 0 if either n1 6= \u00f11 or n2 6= \u00f12 . On the other hand, if\na(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk) is proportional to a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 , it follows from Equation (41) that the commutator cannot be zero. Analogously one can consider the case of anticommutators.\nThe fact that the number of operators cannot be reduced is also clear from\nthe observation that the (a, a\u2217 ) or (b, b\u2217 ) operators describe an irreducible representation in which the number of states (by definition) cannot be reduced. Our conclusion\nis that in GFQT the definition of neutral particle according to i) is fully unacceptable.\nConsider now whether it is possible to implement the definition ii) in\nGFQT. Recall that we started from the operators (a, a\u2217 ) and defined the operators\n(b, b\u2217 ) by means of Equation (50). Then the latter satisfy the same commutation\nor anticommutation relations as the former and the AB symmetry is valid. Does it\nmean that the particles described by the operators (b, b\u2217 ) are the same as the ones\ndescribed by the operators (a, a\u2217 )? If one starts from the operators (b, b\u2217 ) then, by\nanalogy with Equation (50), the operators (a, a\u2217 ) can be defined as\nb(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 = \u03b7 \u2032(n1 n2 nk)a(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)/F (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\n\n(74)\n\nwhere \u03b7 \u2032 (n1 n2 nk) is some function. By analogy with the consideration in Section 6\none can show that\n\u03b7 \u2032 (n1 n2 nk) = \u03b2(\u22121)n1 +n2 +n \u03b2 \u03b2\u0304 = \u22131\n(75)\nwhere the minus sign refers to the normal spin-statistics connection and the plus to\nthe broken one.\nAs follows from Equations (50), (53-56), (74), (75) and the definition of\nthe quantities \u00f11 and \u00f12 in Section 6, the relation between the quantities \u03b1 and \u03b2 is\n\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 = 1. Therefore, as follows from Equation (75), there exist only two possibilities,\n\u03b2 = \u2213\u03b1, depending on whether the normal spin-statistics connection is valid or not.\nWe conclude that the broken spin-statistics connection implies that \u03b1\u1fb1 = \u03b2 \u03b2\u0304 = 1\nand \u03b2 = \u03b1 while the normal spin-statistics connection implies that \u03b1\u1fb1 = \u03b2 \u03b2\u0304 = \u22121\nand \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b1. Since in the first case there exist solutions such that \u03b1 = \u03b2 (e.g.,\n31\n\n\f\u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1), the particle and its antiparticle can be treated as neutral in the sense\nof the definition ii). Since such a situation is clearly unphysical, one might treat the\nspin-statistics theorem as a requirement excluding neutral particles in the sense ii).\nWe now consider another possible treatment of the spin-statistics theorem, which seems to be much more interesting. In the case of normal spin-statistics\nconnection we have that\n\u03b1\u1fb1 = \u22121\n(76)\nand the problem arises whether solutions of this relation exist. Such a relation is\nobviously impossible in standard theory.\nAs noted in Section 1, \u22121 is a quadratic residue in Fp if p = 1 (mod 4)\nand a quadratic non-residue in Fp if p = 3 (mod 4). For example, \u22121 is a quadratic\nresidue in F5 since 22 = \u22121 (mod 5) but in F7 there is no element a such that\na2 = \u22121 (mod 7). We conclude that if p = 1 (mod 4) then Equation (76) has solutions\nin Fp and in that case the theory can be constructed without any extension of Fp .\nConsider now the case p = 3 (mod 4). Then Equation (76) has no solutions\nin Fp and it is necessary to consider this equation in an extension of Fp (i.e., there is\nno \"real\" version of GFQT). The minimum extension is obviously Fp2 and therefore\nthe problem arises whether Equation (76) has solutions in Fp2 .\nIt is well known [22, 23, 24] that any Galois field without its zero element\nis a cyclic multiplicative group. Let r be a primitive root, i.e., the element such that\nany nonzero element of Fp2 can be represented as r k (k = 1, 2, ..., p2 \u2212 1). It is also\nwell known that the only nontrivial automorphism of Fp2 is \u03b1 \u2192 \u1fb1 = \u03b1p . Therefore\n2\n2\nif \u03b1 = r k then \u03b1\u1fb1 = r (p+1)k . On the other hand, since r (p \u22121) = 1, r (p \u22121)/2 = \u22121.\nTherefore there exists at least a solution with k = (p \u2212 1)/2.\nOur conclusion is that if p = 3 (mod 4) then the spin-statistics theorem\nimplies that the field Fp should necessarily be extended and the minimum possible\nextension is Fp2 . Therefore the spin-statistics theorem can be treated as a requirement\nthat GFQT should be based on Fp2 and standard theory should be based on complex\nnumbers.\nLet us now discuss a different approach to the AB symmetry. A desire to\nhave operators which can be interpreted as those relating separately to particles and\nantiparticles is natural in view of our experience in standard approach. However, one\nmight think that in the spirit of GFQT there is no need to have separate operators for\nparticles and antiparticles since they are different states of the same object. We can\ntherefore reformulate the AB symmetry in terms of only (a, a\u2217 ) operators as follows.\nInstead of Equations (50) and (51), we consider a transformation defined as\na(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 \u2192 \u03b7(n1 n2 nk)a(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)/F (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\na(n1 n2 nk) \u2192 \u03b7\u0304(n1 n2 nk)a(\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\u2217 /F (\u00f11 \u00f12 nk)\n\n(77)\n\nThen the AB symmetry can be formulated as a requirement that physical results\nshould be invariant under this transformation.\n32\n\n\fLet us now apply the AB transformation twice. Then, by analogy with\nthe derivation of Equation (57), we get\na(n1 n2 nk)\u2217 \u2192 \u2213a(n1 n2 nk)\u2217\n\na(n1 n2 nk) \u2192 \u2213a(n1 n2 nk)\n\n(78)\n\nfor the normal and broken spin-statistic connections, respectively. Therefore, as a\nconsequence of the spin-statistics theorem, any particle (with the integer or halfinteger spin) has the AB2 parity equal to \u22121. Therefore in GFQT any interaction\ncan involve only an even number of creation and annihilation operators. In particular,\nthis is additional demonstration of the fact that in GFQT the existence of neutral\nelementary particles is incompatible with the spin-statistics theorem.\n\n11\n\nModular IRs of the osp(1,4) Superalgebra\n\nIf one accepts supersymmetry then the results on modular IRs of the so(2,3) algebra\ncan be generalized by considering modular IRs of the osp(1,4) superalgebra. Representations of the osp(1,4) superalgebra have several interesting distinctions from\nrepresentations of the Poincare superalgebra. For this reason we first briefly mention\nsome well known facts about the latter representations (see e.g Reference [45] for\ndetails).\nRepresentations of the Poincare superalgebra are described by 14 operators. Ten of them are the well known representation operators of the Poincare\nalgebra-four momentum operators and six representation operators of the Lorentz\nalgebra, which satisfy the well known commutation relations. In addition, there\nalso exist four fermionic operators. The anticommutators of the fermionic operators are linear combinations of the momentum operators, and the commutators of\nthe fermionic operators with the Lorentz algebra operators are linear combinations\nof the fermionic operators. In addition, the fermionic operators commute with the\nmomentum operators.\nFrom the formal point of view, representations of the osp(1,4) superalgebra are also described by 14 operators - ten representation operators of the so(2,3)\nalgebra and four fermionic operators. There are three types of relations: the operators\nof the so(2,3) algebra commute with each other as usual (see Section 3), anticommutators of the fermionic operators are linear combinations of the so(2,3) operators and\ncommutators of the latter with the fermionic operators are their linear combinations.\nHowever, in fact representations of the osp(1,4) superalgebra can be described exclusively in terms of the fermionic operators. The matter is as follows. In the general\ncase the anticommutators of four operators form ten independent linear combinations.\nTherefore, ten bosonic operators can be expressed in terms of fermionic ones. This is\nnot the case for the Poincare superalgebra since the Poincare algebra operators are\nobtained from the so(2,3) ones by contraction. One can say that the representations\nof the osp(1,4) superalgebra is an implementation of the idea that supersymmetry is\n33\n\n\fthe extraction of the square root from the usual symmetry (by analogy with the well\nknown treatment of the Dirac equation as a square root from the Klein-Gordon one).\nWe denote the fermionic operators of the osp(1,4) superalgebra as\n\u2217 \u2217\n(d1 , d2 , d1, d2 ) where the \u2217 means the Hermitian conjugation as usual. They should\nsatisfy the following relations. If (A, B, C) are any fermionic operators, [...,...] is used\nto denote a commutator and {..., ...} to denote an anticommutator then\n[A, {B, C}] = F (A, B)C + F (A, C)B\n\n(79)\n\nwhere the form F (A, B) is skew symmetric, F (dj , d\u2217j ) = 1 (j = 1, 2) and the other\nindependent values of F (A, B) are equal to zero. The fact that the representation of\nthe osp(1,4) superalgebra is fully defined by Equation (79) and the properties of the\nform F (., .), shows that osp(1,4) is a special case of the superalgebra.\nWe can now define the so(2,3) generators as follows:\nb\u2032 = {d1 , d2 } b\" = {d\u22171, d\u22172 } L+ = {d2 , d\u22171 } L\u2212 = {d1 , d\u22172 }\na\u2032j = (dj )2 aj \" = (d\u2217j )2 hj = {dj , d\u2217j } (j = 1, 2)\n\n(80)\n\nThen by using Equation (79) and the properties of the form F (., .), one can show by\ndirect calculations that so defined operators satisfy the commutation relations (8-10).\nThis result can be treated as a fact that the operators of the so(2,3) algebra are not\nfundamental, only the fermionic operators are.\nBy analogy with the construction of IRs of the osp(1,4) superalgebra in\nstandard theory [46], we require the existence of the cyclic vector e0 satisfying the\nconditions (compare with Equation (13)):\ndj e0 = L+ e0 = 0 hj e0 = qj e0\n\n(e0 , e0 ) 6= 0 (j = 1, 2)\n\n(81)\n\nThe full representation space can be obtained by successively acting by the fermionic\noperators on e0 and taking all possible linear combinations of such vectors.\nWe use E to denote an arbitrary linear combination of the vectors\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(e0 , d1 e0 , d2 e0 , d\u22172 d\u22171 e0 ). Our next goal is to prove a statement analogous to that in\nReference [46]:\nStatement 1: Any vector from the representation space can be represented\nas a linear combination of the elements O1 O2 ...On E where n = 0, 1, ... and Oi is an\noperator of the so(2,3) algebra.\nThe first step is to prove a simple\nLemma: If D is any fermionic operator then DE is a linear combination\nof elements E and OE where O is an operator of the so(2,3) algebra.\nThe proof is by a straightforward check using Equations (79-81). For\nexample,\nd\u22171 (d\u22172 d\u22171 e0 ) = {d\u22171 , d\u22172 }d\u22171 e0 \u2212 d\u22172 a1 \"e0 = b\"d\u22171 e0 \u2212 a1 \"d\u22172 e0\nTo prove Statement 1 we define the height of a linear combination of the\nelements O1 O2 ...On E as the maximum sum of powers of the fermionic operator in\n34\n\n\fthis element. For example, since every operator of the so(2,3) algebra is composed\nof two fermionic operator, the height of the element O1 O2 ...On E equals 2n + 2 if E\ncontains d\u22172 d\u22171 e0 , equals 2n + 1 if E does not contain d\u22172 d\u22171 e0 but contains either d\u22171 e0\nor d\u22172 e0 and equals 2n if E contains only e0 .\nWe can now prove Statement 1 by induction. The elements with the\nheights 0,1 and 2 obviously have the required form since, as follows from Equation\n(80), d\u22171 d\u22172 e0 = b\"e0 \u2212d\u22172 d\u22171 e0 . Let us assume that Statement 1 is correct for all elements\nwith the heights \u2264 N. Every element with the height N + 1 can be represented as Dx\nwhere x is an element with the height N. If x = O1 O2 ...On E then by using Equation\n(79) we can represent Dx as Dx = O1 O2 ...On DE + y where the height of the element\ny is equal to N \u2212 1. As follows from the induction assumption, y has the required\nform, and, as follows from Lemma, DE is a linear combination of the elements E and\nOE. Therefore Statement 1 is proved.\nAs follows from Equations (79) and (80),\n[dj , hj ] = dj\n\n[d\u2217j , hj ] = \u2212d\u2217j\n\n[dj , hl ] = [d\u2217j , hl ] = 0 (j, l = 1, 2 j 6= l)\n\n(82)\n\nIt follows from these expressions that if x is such that hj x = \u03b1j x (j = 1, 2) then d\u22171 x\nis the eigenvector of the operators hj with the eigenvalues (\u03b11 + 1, \u03b12 ), d\u22172 x - with the\neigenvalues (\u03b11 , \u03b12 + 1), d1 x - with the eigenvalues (\u03b11 \u2212 1, \u03b12 ), and d2 x - with the\neigenvalues \u03b11 , \u03b12 \u2212 1.\nLet us assume that q2 \u2265 1 and q1 \u2265 q2 . We again use m to denote q1 + q2\nand s to denote q1 \u2212 q2 . Statement 1 obviously remains valid if we now assume that\nE contains linear combinations of (e0 , e1 , e2 , e3 ) where\ne1 = d\u22171 e0\n\ne2 = d\u22172 e0 \u2212\n\n1\nL\u2212 e1\ns+1\n\ne3 = (d\u22172 d\u22171 e0 \u2212\n\nq1 \u2212 1\n1\nb\" +\na1 \"L\u2212 )e0 (83)\nm\u22122\nm\u22122\n\nWe assume for simplicity that (e0 , e0 ) = 1. Then it can be shown by direct calculations\nusing Equations (79-81) that\n(e1 , e1 ) = q1\n\n(e2 , e2 ) =\n\ns(q2 \u2212 1)\ns+1\n\n(e3 , e3 ) =\n\nq1 (q2 \u2212 1)(m \u2212 1)\nm\u22122\n\n(84)\n\nAs follows from Equations (79-82), e0 satisfies Equation (13) and e1 satisfies the same condition with q1 replaced by q1 + 1. We see that the representation of\nthe osp(1,4) superalgebra defined by Equation (81) necessarily contains at least two\nIRs of the so(2,3) algebra characterized by the values of the mass and spin (m, s) and\n(m + 1, s + 1), and the cyclic vectors e0 and e1 , respectively.\nAs follows from Equations (79-82), the vectors e2 and e3 satisfy the conditions\nh1 e2 = q1 e2 h2 e2 = (q2 + 1)e2 h1 e3 = (q1 + 1)e3\nh2 e3 = (q2 + 1)e3 a\u20321 ej = a\u20322 ej = b\u2032 ej = L+ ej = 0\n35\n\n(85)\n\n\f(j = 2, 3) and therefore (see Equation (13)) they are candidates for being cyclic\nvectors of IRs of the so(2,3) algebra if their norm is not equal to zero. As follows\nfrom Equation (84), (e2 , e2 ) 6= 0 if s 6= 0 and q2 6= 1. Therefore, if these conditions\nare satisfied, e2 is the cyclic vector of IR of the so(2,3) algebra characterized by the\nvalues of the mass and spin (m + 1, s \u2212 1). Analogously, if q2 6= 1 then e3 is the cyclic\nvector of IR of the so(2,3) algebra characterized by the values of the mass and spin\n(m + 2, s).\nAs already mentioned, our considerations are similar to those in Reference\n[46]. Therefore modular IRs of the osp(1,4) superalgebra can be characterized in the\nsame way as conventional IRs [46, 47]:\n\u2022 If q2 > 1 and s 6= 0 (massive IRs), the osp(1,4) supermultiplets contain four\nIRs of the so(2,3) algebra characterized by the values of the mass and spin\n(m, s), (m + 1, s + 1), (m + 1, s \u2212 1), (m + 2, s).\n\u2022 If q2 > 1 and s = 0 (collapsed massive IRs), the osp(1,4) supermultiplets contain\nthree IRs of the so(2,3) algebra characterized by the values of the mass and spin\n(m, s), (m + 1, s + 1), (m + 2, s).\n\u2022 If q2 = 1 (massless IRs) the osp(1,4) supermultiplets contains two IRs of the\nso(2,3) algebra characterized by the values of the mass and spin (2 + s, s), (3 +\ns, s + 1)\n\u2022 Dirac supermultiplet containing two Dirac singletons (see Section 4).\nThe first three cases have well known analogs of IRs of the super-Poincare\nalgebra (see e.g., Reference [45]) while there is no super-Poincare analog of the Dirac\nsupermultiplet.\nSince the space of IR of the superalgebra osp(1,4) is a direct sum of spaces\nof IRs of the so(2,3) algebra, for modular IRs of the osp(1,4) superalgebra one can\nprove results analogous to those discussed in the preceding sections. In particular,\none modular IR of the osp(1,4) algebra is a modular analog of both standard IRs\nof the osp(1,4) superalgebra with positive and negative energies. This implies that\none modular IR of the osp(1,4) superalgebra contains both, a superparticle and its\nanti-superparticle. It is possible to prove a superanalog of the AB symmetry and\nshow that the AB symmetries of particles in the supermultiplet should satisfy certain\nrelations which impose a restriction on the form of interaction in supersymmetric\ntheory (see Reference [48]). It is also possible to show that a separation of states into\nsuperparticles and anti-superparticles encounters the same problems as in the so(2,3)\ncase. The details of calculations can be found in Reference [48].\n\n36\n\n\f12\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present paper we discuss a quantum theory based on a Galois field (GFQT).\nAs noted in Section 1, GFQT does not contain infinities at all and all operators\nare automatically well defined. In my discussions with physicists, some of them\ncommented this fact as follows. This is an approach where a cutoff (the characteristic\np of the Galois field) is introduced from the beginning and for this reason there is\nnothing strange in the fact that the theory does not have infinities. It has a large\nnumber p instead and this number can be practically treated as infinite.\nHowever, the difference between Galois fields and usual numbers is not\nonly that the former are finite and the latter are infinite. If the set of usual numbers\nis visualized as a straight line from \u2212\u221e to +\u221e then the simplest Galois field can be\nvisualized not as a segment of this line but as a circumference (see Fig. 1 in Section\n1). This reflects the fact that in Galois fields the rules of arithmetic are different and,\nas a result, GFQT has many unusual features which have no analogs in standard\ntheory.\nThe Dirac vacuum energy problem discussed in Section 9 is a good illustration of this point. Indeed, in standard theory the vacuum energy is infinite and,\nif GFQT is treated simply as a theory with a cutoff p, one would expect the vacuum\nenergy to be of order p. However, since the rules of arithmetic in Galois fields are\ndifferent from standard ones, the result of exact (i.e., non-perturbative) calculation\nof the vacuum energy is precisely zero.\nThe original motivation for investigating GFQT was as follows. Let us\ntake standard QED in dS or AdS space, write the Hamiltonian and other operators\nin angular momentum basis and replace standard irreducible representations (IRs) for\nthe electron, positron and photon by corresponding modular IRs. One might treat\nthis motivation as an attempt to substantiate standard momentum regularizations\n(e.g., the Pauli-Villars regularization) at momenta p/R (where R is the radius of the\nUniverse). In other terms this might be treated as introducing fundamental length of\norder R/p. We now discuss reasons explaining why this naive attempt fails.\nThe main result of the present paper is that in GFQT the existence of\nantiparticles follows from the fact that any Galois field is finite. Moreover, the very\nexistence of antiparticles might be an indication that nature is described rather by a\nfinite field or ring than by complex numbers. We believe that this result is not only\nvery important but also extremely simple and beautiful. A mathematical consideration of modular IRs is given in Sections 2-4 while a simple explanation of the above\nresult is as follows.\nIn standard theory a particle is described by a positive energy IR where the\nenergy has the spectrum in the range [mass, \u221e). At the same time, the corresponding\nantiparticle is associated with a negative energy IR where the energy has the spectrum\nin the range (\u2212\u221e, \u2212mass]. Consider now the construction of modular IR for some\nparticle. We again start from the rest state (where energy=mass) and gradually\n37\n\n\fconstruct states with higher and higher energies. However, in such a way we are\nmoving not along a straight line but along the circumference in Figure 1. Then\nsooner or later we will arrive at the point where energy=-mass.\nIn QFT the fact that a particle and its antiparticle have the same masses\nand spins but opposite charges follows from the CPT theorem, which is a consequence\nof locality. A question arises what happens if locality is only an approximation: in\nthat case the equality of masses, spins etc. is exact or approximate? Consider a simple\nmodel when electromagnetic and weak interactions are absent. Then the fact that\nthe proton and the neutron have the same masses and spins has nothing to do with\nlocality; it is only a consequence of the fact that the proton and the neutron belong\nto the same isotopic multiplet. In other words, they are simply different states of the\nsame object - the nucleon. We see, that in GFQT the situation is analogous. The\nfact that a particle and its antiparticle have the same masses and spins but opposite\ncharges has nothing to do with locality or non-locality and is simply a consequence\nof the fact that they are different states of the same object since they belong to the\nsame IR.\nIn standard theory, a particle and its antiparticle are combined together\nby a local covariant equation (e.g., the Dirac equation). We see that in GFQT the\nidea of the Dirac equation is implemented without assuming locality but already at\nthe level of IRs. This automatically explains the existence of antiparticles, shows that\na particle cannot exist by itself without its antiparticle and that a particle and its\nantiparticle are necessarily different states of the same object. In particular, there\nare no elementary particles which in standard theory are called neutral.\nIf a particle is characterized by some additive quantum numbers (e.g.,\nthe electric, baryon or lepton charges) then, as follows from our construction (see\nEquations (50) and (51)), the corresponding antiparticle is characterized by the same\nquantum numbers but with the opposite sign. In standard theory such quantum\nnumbers are conserved because IRs describing a particle and its antiparticle are fully\nindependent. However, since in GFQT a particle and its antiparticle belong to the\nsame IR, the problem arises whether these quantum numbers are exactly conserved.\nLet us discuss this problem in greater details.\nIn quantum theory there is a superselection rule (SSR) prohibiting states\nwhich are superpositions of states with different electric, baryon or lepton charges. In\ngeneral, if states \u03c81 and \u03c82 are such that there are no physical operators A such that\n(\u03c82 , A\u03c81 ) 6= 0 then the SSR says that the state \u03c8 = \u03c81 +\u03c82 is prohibited. The meaning\nof the SSR is now widely discussed (see e.g., Reference [49] and references therein).\nSince the SSR implies that the superposition principle, which is a key principle of\nquantum theory, is not universal, several authors argue that the SSR should not be\npresent in quantum theory. Other authors argue that the SSR is only a dynamical\nprinciple since, as a result of decoherence, the state \u03c8 will quickly disappear and so\nit cannot be observable.\nIn our construction, one IR describes an object characterized by quan38\n\n\ftum numbers (n1 n2 nk) (see Section 3). We have discussed an interpretation that\na half of the numbers are related to a particle and the another half to the corresponding antiparticle. However, since those numbers describe the same IR, there are\noperators mixing the particle and antiparticle states. Therefore the very notions of\nparticle and antiparticles are approximate, the conservation of electric, baryon and\nlepton charges is also approximate and superpositions of particle and antiparticle\nstates are not strictly prohibited. These notions and conservation laws are valid only\nin the approximation when one considers only transformations not mixing particle\nand antiparticle states. In Section 8 we discussed a possibility that one IR can be\nsplit into independent IRs for a particle and its antiparticle. It has been shown that\nsuch a possibility can be implemented but only at the expense of breaking the exact\nAdS symmetry. Since we accept that symmetry is the most important criterion, we\nconclude that the very notions of particle and antiparticles are approximate and the\nelectric, baryon and lepton charges are only approximately conserved quantities. The\nnon-conservation of the baryon and lepton quantum numbers has been already considered in models of Grand Unification but the electric charge has been always believed\nto be a strictly conserved quantum number. The non-conservation of these quantum numbers also completely changes the status of the problem known as \"baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe\" since at early stages of the Universe energies were much\ngreater than now and therefore transitions between particles and antiparticles had a\nmuch greater probability.\nWe have also shown in Section 10 that in GFQT there can be no neutral\nelementary particles. As explained in this section, the spin-statistics theorem can be\ntreated as a requirement that standard quantum theory should be based on complex\nnumbers. This requirement excludes the existence of neutral elementary particles.\nOne might conclude that since in GFQT the photon cannot be elementary, this theory\ncannot be realistic and does not deserve attention. We believe however, that the\nnonexistence of neutral elementary particles in GFQT shows that the photon (and\nthe graviton and the Higgs boson if they exist) should be considered on a deeper\nlevel. In Section 4 we argued that in GFQT a possibility that massless particles are\ncomposite states of Dirac singletons is even more attractive than in standard theory.\nAn important problem is what GFQT can say about supersymmetry.\nThere is no doubt that supersymmetry is a beautiful idea. On the other hand, one\nmight say that there is no reason for nature to have both, elementary fermions and\nelementary bosons since the latter can be constructed from the former. A well know\nhistorical analogy is that the simplest covariant equation is not the Klein-Gordon\nequation for spinless fields but the Dirac and Weyl equations for the spin 1/2 fields\nsince the former is the equation of the second order while the latter are the equations of the first order. In Section 11 we have described results for modular IRs of\nthe osp(1,4) superalgebra and noted that supersymmetry does not impose strong restrictions on the structure of modular IRs. Therefore the problem of supersymmetry\nremains open.\n39\n\n\fConsider now the following very important question. If we accept that the\ncosmological constant \u039b is positive then in the framework of standard theory based on\ncomplex numbers we have to draw a conclusion that the dS algebra so(1,4) is a more\nrelevant symmetry algebra than the Poincare and AdS algebras. Therefore elementary\nparticles should be described by IRs of the so(1,4) algebra rather than IRs of the other\ntwo algebras. As shown in Reference [50], the only possible interpretation of IRs of\nthe so(1,4) algebra is that they describe a particle and its antiparticle simultaneously.\nTherefore the very notions of particles and antiparticles are only approximate and the\nelectric, baryon and lepton charges can be only approximately conserved quantities.\nIn addition, only fermions can be elementary (since in standard theory only \u03b1\u1fb1 = 1\nis possible while Equation (76) is not) and there are no neutral elementary particles.\nIn view of these remarks, a question arises whether the consideration of modular IRs\nof the so(2,3) algebra is compatible with the fact that \u039b > 0. In standard theory a\ndifference between IRs of the so(2,3) and so(1,4) algebras is that an IR of the so(2,3)\nalgebra where the operators M \u03bc5 (\u03bc = 0, 1, 2, 3) are Hermitian can be treated as\nIRs of the so(1,4) algebra where these operators are anti-Hermitian and vice versa.\nAs noted in Section 1, in GFQT a probabilistic interpretation is only approximate.\nTherefore one cannot exclude a possibility that elementary particles can be described\nby modular IRs discussed in this paper while modular representations describing\nsymmetry of macroscopic bodies at cosmological distances are modular analogs of\nstandard representations of the so(1,4) algebra.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to F.
