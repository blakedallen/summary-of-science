A Reynolds decomposition, whereby the\nproperties of the stellar plasma are separated into mean\nand fluctuating components \u03c6 = h\u03c6i + \u03c6\u2032 provides some\nCasey A. Meakin\nW. David Arnett\nSteward Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, 85721,\nUSA\n\ninsight into the problem. Decomposing the kinetic energy equation (formulated by the product of the velocity and the momentum equation) in this way and taking\ntemporal and angular averages (indicated by the operator h*i) results in (Meakin & Arnett 2007b)\n\u2202t h\u03c1EK i + \u2207 * h\u03c1EK u0 i =\n\u2212\u2207 * hFp + FK i + hp\u2032 \u2207 * u\u2032 i + hWb i \u2212 h\u01ebK i\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is the full non-linear governing equation of interest. The primary goal of any stellar turbulence theory is\nto model the terms of this equation, including the rate\nof buoyancy work Wb = \u03c1\u2032 u\u2032 * g, the kinetic energy flux\nFK = u\u2032 EK , the pressure correlation flux Fp = u\u2032 p\u2032 ,\nthe work done by pressure fluctuations p\u2032 \u2207 * u\u2032 , and\nthe rate at which kinetic energy EK , is dissipated \u01ebK .\nDifferential rotation and circulation currents introduce\nadditional sources of turbulence and transport terms.\nIt is standard practice to ignore or grossly approximate most of these terms in stellar evolution calculations. For instance, mixing length theory (MLT) ignores \u01ebK , Fp , FK , and p\u2032 \u2207*u\u2032 and approximates the integral of Wb over a mixing length as the product of local\nproperties of the flow. The time dependence expressed\nby the left hand side of Eq. 1 is also dropped. Though\nstill not widely used, some strides have been made to\ncompensate for these deficiencies through embellished\nMLT type algorithms, most notably to address the issue of time dependence and the non-local nature of turbulence (e.g. Gough 1976; Unno 1981; Eggleton 1983;\nKuhfuss 1986; Deng et al. 2006, and references therein).\nIn order to develop a more realistic physical description of stellar turbulence, which is of central importance to modeling stellar pulsation (e.g. Belkacem et al.\n2006; Samadi et al. 2009), a better understanding of\nthese non-linear terms is needed. A powerful method\nfor gaining insight into this physics is analyzing fully\nnon-linear simulation data. In the following we present\n\n\f2\n\na few select models from a new suite of turbulent stellar\nconvection simulations designed to this end and briefly\ndiscuss the origin of the kinetic energy flux and its relationship to the kinetic energy dissipation and the large\nscale topology of the flow.\n\n2 Simulation Setup\nThe initial conditions used in our reactive hydrodynamic simulations are based on a 23 M\u2299 star model\nwhich has been evolved with the TYCHO stellar evolution code (Arnett et al. 2009b) to an age of \u223c 2 \u00d7 106\nyr, at which point oxygen is burning in a shell that overlies a silicon-sulfur-rich core (Meakin & Arnett 2007b,\n2006). Variations in the driving source are made in\norder to study how this impacts the global characteristics of the flow, and in turn how this affects the transport terms. Three models are presented including two\nin which heating (by nuclear burning) is present and\none in which convection is driven by a cooling region\nnear the top of the convection zone (similar to radiative\nlosses in surface convection zones). The heating and\ncooling profiles are presented in Fig 1. The heated and\ncooled regions (0.44 . r/109 cm . 0.64) are initially\nnearly adiabatic, and thus neutrally buoyant, while the\nsurrounding layers are stably stratified. The fully compressible, reactive Euler equations are solved using the\nPROMPI code (Meakin & Arnett 2007b) which is a\ndescendant of the PROMETHEUS piecewise parabolic\nmethod (PPM) code (Fryxell, M\u00fcller, & Arnett 1989)\nadapted to parallel computing platforms. We work\nwithin the implicit large eddy simulation (ILES) framework to treat the grid-scale dissipation and turbulent stresses (e.g. Boris 2007; Aspden 2007; Benzi et al.\n2008). The sensitivity of our results on resolution are\ntested within limits of computational cost by a series\nof higher resolution runs. A summary of simulation\nproperties is presented in Table 1.\n\nthe simulated regions are not in thermal balance (there\nis either a net heating or cooling) the entropy will\nchange over time and the fluxes and flows within the\nconvection zones adjust to establish an isentropic state\nat each moment. In this situation the rate of entropy\nchange at any one location is equal to that of the mass\naveraged rate over the convection zone, \u1e61 = h\u1e61im , where\nh*im indicates a mass weighted average over the turbulent region. From the first law (\u03b4Q = dU + \u03b4W ) and\nthe fundamental thermodynamic relationship (dU =\nT dS \u2212 \u03b4W )\n\u0010\u01eb + \u01eb\nh\u01ebn + \u01ebK im\ndLC /dm \u0011\nn\nK\n= h\u1e61im =\n\u2212\nT\nT\nhT im\n\n(2)\n\nand the convective luminosity is\n\nLC (m) =\n\nM0 +m\n\nZ\n\nM0\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u01ebn + \u01ebK \u2212 T h\u1e61im dm\u2032\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u01ebn is the local heating or cooling term (see Fig. 1).\nThe convective flux found from this relationship is\ncompared to the simulation data in Fig 2 for all three\nmodels. The good agreement shows that thermal relaxation is not necessary to study turbulent convection but\ncan be incorporated into the analysis. A much more\nimportant effect than this slow thermal relaxation is\nthe luminosity associated with boundary layer mixing\nevents which is as large as \u223c40% of peak in model c1.\nThe kinetic energy dissipation \u01ebK is required to appropriately calculate h\u1e61im and is included in standard\nstellar evolution (i.e., MLT) only implicitly through the\nstructure variable \u2207 = d ln T /d ln P . The distribution\nof \u01ebK throughout a convection zone, however, is intimately related to the resulting kinetic energy flux,\nwhich we discuss next.\n\n4 Kinetic Energy Flux and \u01ebK\n3 Thermal Relaxation\nThe time evolution of the kinetic energy is presented\nin Fig. 1. The convective turnover time \u03c4c = 2L/v is a\nlittle less than \u03c4c \u223c100 s for all of the models studied.\nAfter an initial transient comparable to \u03c4c the models attain a quasi-steady state. The strong damping\npresent in turbulent flow (see e.g. Arnett et al. 2009a)\nensures that this state is reached within \u223c \u03c4c . Time\naverages for analysis are performed over intervals that\nencompass \u223c 2\u03c4c and are summarized in Table 1.\nThe simulated convection is very efficient in all cases\nand deviates only mildly from an isentropic state. Since\n\nIn quasi-steady states where Fp and p\u2032 \u2207 * u\u2032 are not\nimportant the kinetic energy flux (or luminosity) can\nbe found by integrating Eq. 1\n\nLK (m) =\n\nZ\n\nM0 +m\n\nM0\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndr\u2032\n\u2212 \u01ebK dm\u2032\nLC \u2207ad\nHp\n\n(4)\n\nwith dr\u2032 = dm\u2032 /4\u03c0r\u20322 \u03c1.

From Eq. 4 we see that the kinetic\nenergy flux is the residual between buoyancy driving and\nviscous dissipation.\nR\nGlobally, the integrated dissipation \u01ebK dm is constrained by both the thermal state evolution, T \u1e61 (Eq. 2,\n3), and the balance with buoyancy driving (Eq. 4, noting that LK (rtop ) = LK (rbot ) = 0). The radial profile\nof \u01ebK is determined by the topology of the convective\nflow. Arnett et al. (2009a) show that the dissipation is\nwell described by the properties of the isotropic compo2\n3\nnent of turbulence, viso\n\u223c 23 (v\u03b82 + v\u03c62 ) with \u01ebK \u223c viso\n/ld\nwhere ld is the largest scale of motion in the flow and\nv\u03b8 and v\u03c6 are the non-radial velocity fluctuations.\nIn Fig. 3 we present the radial distribution of the kinetic energy from the simulation data. The first panel\nshows the total EK and the second panel shows the\nhorizontal component scaled to an equivalent isotropic\nvalue, EK,iso = 32 EK,H . The increase in EK,H at\nthe boundaries of the convection zones are due to the\nhorizontal deflection of the large scale flow and wave\nmotions excited in stable layers (e.g. Meakin & Arnett\n2006, 2007a) and should be corrected for when identifying EK,iso with the convective turbulence.\nIn Fig. 3 (right) we over plot two approximations to\nEK,iso : one based on a uniform distribution of dissipation and one based on a dissipation that decreases\nlinearly with enclosed mass. The relationship \u01ebK =\n(2EK,iso )3/2 /ld with ld = Hp is used. The absolute scale\nof the dissipation and kinetic energy profiles are provided by the constraint that the global dissipation rate\nmust balance the global rate of buoyancy driving. The\namplitude of the kinetic energy that satisfies this global\nbalance is found by varying it until the boundary conditions on LK are satisfied (i.e., LK = 0 at the boundaries\nof the convection zone). EK,iso \u223c 12 (Fc /\u03c1)2/3 provides\na good first approximation.\nThe kinetic energy fluxes found using this procedure\nare compared to the simulation data in Fig. 4 for the\ntwo assumed dissipation profiles.\n\n5\n\nin a future publication. For now we shall suffice to\nsay that the dissipation can be derived directly from\nthe stellar model by adopting certain constraints on\nthe topology of the convective flow. In particular, a\ntwo component flow model consisting of a background\nisotropic turbulent state and a large scale, plume-like\nflow is a promising approach.\nThe data presented in Figs. 3 and 4 illustrate the\nshortcomings of the commonly used closure relation referred to as the down gradient approximation1 . Most illustrative is the fact that while the EK distributions are\nnearly identical in models h1 and c1 the LK profiles are\nroughly mirror images. The locally defined down gradient approximation flux fails because the properties of\nthe turbulent transport are strongly shaped by global\nconstraints, a feature that is captured by the analysis\npresented in \u00a74.\nAnother consequence of the distribution of kinetic\nenergy within the convection zone is the rate of boundary layer mixing (see Fig. 2), which can significantly\nmodify the stellar structure on evolutionary timescales\n(see \u00a77 in Meakin & Arnett 2007b).\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by NSF Grant 0708871 and\nNASA Grant NNX08AH19G at the University of Arizona.

The\nonly assumption made in our analysis involved the radial profile of the dissipation \u01ebK which we will discuss\n\n1 The\n\ndown gradient approximation is a closure relationship which\nrelates the kinetic energy flux to the gradient of the turbulent\nkinetic energy such that LK \u221d \u2212\u2207EK .\n\n\f6\n\nReferences\nArnett, D., Meakin, C., & Young, P.
