Filtered chain complexes versus holonomy. Filtered chain complexes and their\nassociated spectral sequences and exact triangles are standard tools of Homological Algebra\nthat have found numerous applications in the deep categorification theories of Khovanov,\nKronheimer-Mrowka, Ozsv\u00e1th-Sz\u00e1bo and many others; see [Kho00, KM04, OS04]. For instance the genus of a knot in 3-space can be effectively computed by the Knot Homology of\n[OS04].\nOn the other hand, one has the TQFT invariants of knotted 3-dimensional objects, and a\ngood example to keep in mind is the famous Jones polynomial of a knot; see [Jon87]. There\nare several known and conjectured connections between the (colored) Jones polynomial of\na knot and the geometry and topology of the knot complement. In particular, the colored\nJones polynomial determines the Alexander polynomial ([BNG96, GL11]), and is conjectured\nto determine\n(a) the Volume of the knot ([Kas97, MM01]),\n(b) the A-polynomial of the knot via the AJ-Conjecture ([Gar04]),\n(c) at least two boundary slopes of incompressible surfaces of the knot complement via\nthe Slope Conjecture ([Gar11a]), and\n(d) the invariant trace field of a hyperbolic knot, via the subleading asymptotics to the\nVolume Conjecture ([Gar08, DGLZ09, GZ])\nKnot Homology and TQFT have their own strengths. A major advantage of Knot Homology\nis its functorial nature, which numerical TQFT invariants (such as the Jones polynomial)\nlack. What concept plays the role of functoriality in TQFT? We argue that the notions\nof holonomy and q-holonomy play this role in TQFT. We illustrate this principle with two\nindependent results.\n\u2022 We study the behavior of the A-polynomial and quantum invariants (such as the\nJones or Alexander polynomials) under 1-parameter fillings of a 2-cusped manifold,\nsee Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 below. In the A-polynomial case, it divides a holonomic\nsequence of polynomials in 2-variables, and in the quantum invariant case, it is a\nholonomic sequence of polynomials in one variable.\n\u2022 We prove that the Newton polygon Nn of a holonomic sequence of polynomials is\nquasi-linear; see Theorem 1.3. This complements results of [CW10] and [Gar11a].\nHolonomy (and q-holonomy) was studied extensively by Zeilberger; see [Zei90]. q-holonomic\nsequences of polynomials in one variable appeared in Quantum Topology in [GL05], where\nit was shown that the colored Jones function of a knot and an arbitrary simple Lie algebra\nis q-holonomic; see [GL05, Thm.1].\nHolonomic sequences of multivariable polynomials are easier to analyze, and they appear\nnaturally when one studies geometrically similar families of knots, such as those that arise\nfrom filling of all but one components of a link. This is not difficult to prove, but it is not\nwidely known. Let us recall what is a holonomic sequence following Zeilberger; see [Zei90].\nLet K = Q(x1 , . . . , xr ) denote the field of rational functions in r variables x1 , . . . , xr .\ndef.holo\n\nDefinition 1.1. We say that a sequence of rational functions Rn \u2208 K (defined for all\nintegers n) is recurrent (or, constant coefficient holonomic) if it satisfies a linear recursion\nwith constant coefficients. In other words, there exists a natural number d and ck \u2208 K for\n\n\fTHE NEWTON POLYGON OF A RECURRENCE SEQUENCE AND ITS ROLE IN TQFT\n\n3\n\nk = 0, . . . , d with cd 6= 0 such that for all integers n we have:\n(1)\n\nd\neq.recRR X\n\nck Rn+k = 0\n\nk=0\n\nDepending on the circumstances, one can restrict attention to sequences indexed by the\nnatural (rather than the integer) numbers. Please note that the coefficients of the recursion\n(1) are constant, independent of n. If we allow them to polynomially depend on n, the corresponding sequence is by definition holonomic. Our two applications discussed in Theorems\n1.1 and 1.2 below concern reccurent sequences.\nsub.filling\n\n1.2. The behavior of the A-polynomial under filling. The A-polynomial AM of an\noriented hyperbolic 3-manifold M with one cusp was introduced in [CCG+ 94]. We will\nassume that AM parametrizes a geometric component of the SL(2, C) character variety. AM\nis a 2-variable polynomial which describes the dependence of the eigenvalues of a meridian\nand longitude under any representation of \u03c01 (M) into SL(2, C). The A-polynomial plays a\nkey role in two problems:\n\u2022 the deformation of the hyperbolic structure of M,\n\u2022 the problem of exceptional (i.e., non-hyperbolic) fillings of M.\nKnowledge about the A-polynomial (and often, of its Newton polygon) is translated directly\ninto information of the above problems, and vice-versa. This key property was explained and\nexploited by Culler-Shalen and Gordon-Luecke in [CGLS87, CCG+ 94, Gor09]. Technically,\nthe SL(2, C) character variety of M has several components, and the unique discrete faithful PSL(2, C) representation of the oriented manifold M always lifts to as many SL(2, C)\nrepresentations as the order of the finite group H1 (M, Z/2); see [Cul86]. When M is a complement of a hyperbolic knot in an oriented integer homology sphere, the A-polynomial of\nM is defined to be the SL(2, C) lift of the geometric PSL(2, C) component of M.\nOur first goal is to describe the behavior of the A-polynomial under filling one of the cusps\nof a 2-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold. To state our result, consider an oriented hyperbolic\n3-manifold M which is the complement of a hyperbolic link in a homology 3-sphere. Let\n(\u03bc1 , \u03bb1 ) and (\u03bc2 , \u03bb2 ) denote pairs of meridian-longitude curves along the two cusps C1 and\nC2 of M, and let Mn denote the result of \u22121/n filling on C2 . Let An (m1 , l1 ) denote the\nA-polynomial of Mn with the meridian-longitude pair (\u03bc1 , \u03bb1 ) inherited from M.\nthm.1\n\nTheorem 1.1. For every 3-manifold M as above, there exists a recurrent sequence Rn (m1 , l1 ) \u2208\nQ(m1 , l1 ) such that for all but finitely many integers n, An (m1 , l1 ) divides the numerator of\nRn (m1 , l1 ). In addition, a recursion for Rn can be computed explicitly via elimination, from\nan ideal triangulation of M.\nsub.appqt\n\n1.3. The behavior of Quantum Invariants under filling. In Section 1.2 we showed\nhow holonomic sequences arise in 1-parameter families of character varieties. In this section,\nwe will show how they arise in Quantum Topology. Consider two endomorphisms A, B of\na finite dimensional vector space V over the field Q(q). Let tr(D) denote the trace of an\n\n\f4\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n\nendomorphism D. The next lemma is an elementary application of the Cayley-Hamilton\ntheorem.\nlem.AB\n\nLemma 1.2. With the above assumptions, the sequence tr(AB n ) \u2208 Q(q) is recurrent.\nWe need to recall the relevant Quantum Invariants of links from [Jon87, Jan96, Tur88].\nFix a simple Lie algebra g, a representation V of g, a knot K, and consider the Quantum\ng\nGroup invariant ZV,K\n(q) \u2208 Z[q \u00b11 ]. For instance,\ng\n\u2022 When g = sl2 , and V = C2 is the defining representation, ZV,K\n(q) is the Jones\npolynomial of K.\ng\n\u2022 When g = gl(1|1) and V = C2 , ZV,K\n(q) is the Alexander polynomial of K.\ng\nThe quantum group invariant ZV,K\n(q) can be computed as the trace of an operator associated\nto a braid presentation of K.\nLet L denote a 2-component link in S 3 with one unknotted component C2 , and let Kn\ndenote the knot obtained by \u22121/n filling on C2 . Since S 3 \\ C2 is a solid torus S 1 \u00d7 D 2\nand L is a knot in S 1 \u00d7 D 2 it follows that L is the closure of an (r, r) tangle \u03b1. If \u03b2 is a\nbraid representative of a full positive twist in the braid group of r stands, then it follows\nthat Kn is obtained by the closure of the tangle \u03b1\u03b2 n . If A and B denote the endomorphism\nof V corresponding to \u03b1 and \u03b2 and Q(n) denotes half of the negative of the writhe of \u03b1\u03b2 n\nmultiplied by the quadratic Casimir value of g in V , then we have:\n\nZV,Kn (q) = q \u2212Q(n) tr(AB n )\nNotice that Q(n) is a quadratic function of n, and its presence in the above formula is\nrequired if we insist that Kn is a zero-framed knot. The next theorem follows from the above\ndiscussion, Lemma 1.2 and Theorem 1.3.\nthm.2\n\nTheorem 1.2. Fix a simple Lie algebra g and a representation V of g. With the above\ng\nassumptions, the sequence q Q(n) ZV,K\n(q) \u2208 Q(q) is recurrent.\nn\nsub.newton\n\n1.4. The sequence of Newton polygons of a recurrent sequence of polynomials.\nOften one is interested in the Newton polygon of the A-polynomial; for instance the slopes of\nits sides are boundary slopes of incompressible surfaces as follows by Culler-Shalen theory;\nsee [CS84, CS83]. This is one motivation of our next result. Recall that a quasi-polynomial\nP\np(n) = dj=0 aj (n)nj is a polynomial in one variable n with coefficients aj (n) periodic functions of n. We will call p(n) quasi-linear (resp. quasi-quadratic) if d \u2264 1 (resp., d \u2264 2).\nQuasi-polynomials appear in Enumerative Combinatorics (see [Sta97]), and also in the lattice\npoint counting problems via Ehrhart's theorem [Ehr62]. Quasi-polynomials have appeared\nrecently in the work of Calegari-Walker (see [CW10]) and also in Quantum Topology in\nrelation to the Slope Conjecture; see [Gar11b, Gar11a].\nDefinition 1.3. We say that a sequence Nn of polygons is linear (resp. quasi-linear) if the\ncoordinates of the vertices of Nn are polynomials (resp. quasi-polynomials) of degree at most\none. Likewise, we say that a sequence Nn of polygons is quadratic (resp. quasi-quadratic) if\n\n\fTHE NEWTON POLYGON OF A RECURRENCE SEQUENCE AND ITS ROLE IN TQFT\n\n5\n\nthe coordinates of the vertices of Nn are polynomials (resp. quasi-polynomials) of degree at\nmost two.\nThe next theorem is of independent interest and explains the first part of the title of the\npaper. Its proof follows from first principles of Polyhedral and Tropical Geometry, and the\nLech-Mahler-Skolem theorem of Analytic Number Theory.\nthm.3\n\nTheorem 1.3. Let Nn be sequence of Newton polygons of a holonomic sequence Rn \u2208\n\u00b11\nQ[x\u00b11\n1 , . . . , xr ] \\ {0}. Then, for all but finite many integers n, Nn is quasi-linear.\nThe next corollary of Theorem 1.3 follows from some recent results of Chen-Li-Sam which\ngeneralize the Ehrhart theory; see [CLS10].\ncor.2\n\nCorollary 1.4. Under the hypothesis of Theorem 1.3, the volume and the number of lattice\npoints of Rn is a quasi-polynomial function of n.\nrem.Rnonzero\n\nRemark 1.5. The hypothesis that Rn 6= 0 for all n in Theorem 1.3 is not as strict as it\nseems (and is trivially satisfied in its application to Theorems 1.1 and 1.2). Indeed, the\nSkolem-Mahler-Lech theorem implies that the zero set of any holonomic sequence in a field\nof characteristic zero vanishes on a finite union of full arithmetic progressions minus a finite\nset. See Theorem 3.1 below.\nrem.finite\n\nRemark 1.6. The reader may have noticed that Theorems 1.1 and Theorem 1.3 are valid\nfor all but finitely many integers n. There are two independent sources for this exception.\nIn Theorem 1.1, the exception comes from the Hyperbolic Dehn filling theorem of Thurston\n(see [Thu77] and also [NZ85]), which implies that all but finitely many fillings in one cusp\nof a hyperbolic 3-manifold gives a hyperbolic manifold. The finite set of exceptional fillings\nare the focus of the problem of exceptional Dehn surgery of [CGLS87]. In Theorem 1.3, the\nexceptions come from the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, which states that the zeros of a\nsequence of rational numbers that satisfies a constant coefficient recursion relation are full\nsets of arithmetic progressions, up to a finite exceptional set. Is there a connection between\nexceptional Dehn surgery and the LMS theorem?\nsub.appcv\n\n1.5. Application in character varieties. Theorems 1.1 and 1.3 are general, but in favorable circumstances more is true. Namely, consider a family of knot complements Kn ,\nobtained by \u22121/n filling on a cusp of 2-component hyperbolic link L in S 3 , with linking\nnumber f . Let An (m, l) denote the A-polynomial of Kn with respect to the canonical meridian and longitude (\u03bc, \u03bb) of Kn .\ndef.favor\n\nDefinition 1.7. We say that two component hyperbolic L link in S 3 with linking number\n2\nf is favorable if An (m, lm\u2212f n ) \u2208 Q[m\u00b11 , l\u00b11 ] is holonomic, for all but finitely many values\nof n.\n\n\f6\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n2\n\nThe shift l 7\u2192 lm\u2212f n in the above coefficients is due to the fact that the canonical\nmeridian-longitude pair of Kn differs from the corresponding pair of the unfilled component\nof L due to the nonzero linking number.\nrem.quadshift\n\nRemark 1.8. If Nn is a sequence of Newton polygons in R2 (with coordinates (m, l) which is\nquasi-linear, then the sequence of polygons obtained by applying the transformation (m, l) 7\u2192\n2\n(m, lm\u2212f n ) to Nn is quasi-quadratic. Indeed, there is a finite set I and quasi-linear functions\nsi (n), ti (n) for i \u2208 I such that Nn is the convex hull of (si (n), ti (n)) for i \u2208 I. The monomial\n2\ntransformation (m, l) 7\u2192 (m, lm\u2212f n ) is the linear map (a, b) 7\u2192 (a \u2212 f 2 bn, b) of R2 which\nsends (si (n), ti (n)) to (si (n) \u2212 f 2 ti (n)n, ti (n)). Since si and ti are quasi-linear, it follows that\nsi (n) \u2212 f 2 ti (n)n and ti (n) are quasi-quadratic.\nOur next corollary gives a natural source of sequences of quasi-quadratic polytopes that\ncome from classical topology, i.e., character varieties of knot complements. As discussed in\n[CW10], this class of polytopes is a natural generalization of the sequence nP of scalings of\na fixed rational polytope P .\ncor.3\n\nCorollary 1.9. If a two component link L is favorable, then for all but finitely many n, the\nNewton polygon of An (m, l) is quasi-quadratic.\nFavorable links are more common than one might think. Let us show three favorable links\n\nthe Whitehead link (in the left), the twisted Whitehead link (in the middle) and the pretzel\nlink (in the right). The first two links were shown to be favorable by Hoste-Shanahan (see\n[HS04]) and surgeries gives rise to two families of twist knots. The last link was shown to\nbe favorable in [GM11] and surgeries gives rise to the family of (\u22122, 3, 3 + 2n) pretzel knots.\n1.6. Acknowledgment. The author wishes to thank N. Dunfield, T.T.Q.

Proof of Theorem 1.1\nsec.thm1\n\nFix an oriented hyperbolic 3-manifold M with two cusps C1 and C2 and choice of meridianlongitude (\u03bci , \u03bbi ) on each cusp for i = 1, 2. Let Kn denote the result of \u22121/n filling on C2 .\nWe consider two cases: M has strongly geometrically isolated cusps, or not. For a definition\nof strong geometric isolation, see [NR93] and also [Cal01, CW10]. When M is strongly\n\n\fTHE NEWTON POLYGON OF A RECURRENCE SEQUENCE AND ITS ROLE IN TQFT\n\n7\n\ngeometrically isolated, Dehn filling on one cusp does not change the shape of the other. This\nimplies that An is constant (and therefore, holonomic), for all but finitely many integers n.\nThus, we may assume that M does not have strongly geometrically isolated cusps.\nLet X denote the geometric component of the SL(2, C) character variety of M. The\nhyperbolic Dehn filling theorem of Thurston implies that X is a complex affine surface; see\n[Thu77] and also [NZ85]. So, the field F of rational functions on X has transendence degree\n2. Now X has four known nonconstant rational functions: the eigenvalues of the meridians\nm1 , m2 and the longitudes l1 , l2 around each cusp. So, each triple {m1 , l1 , m2 } and {m1 , l1 , l2 }\nof elements of F is polynomially dependent i.e., satisfies a polynomial equation\n(2)\n\neq.PQ\n\nP (m1 , l1 , m2 ) = 0\n\nQ(m1 , l1 , l2 ) = 0\n\nwhere P (m1 , l1 , m2 ) \u2208 Q(m1 , l1 )[m2 ] and Q(m1 , l1 , l2 ) \u2208 Q(m1 , l1 )[l2 ] are polynomials of\nstrictly positive (by hypothesis) degrees dP and dQ with respect to m2 and l2 . The geometric\ncomponent Xn of the character variety of K is the intersection of X with the Dehn-filling\nequation m2 l2\u2212n = 1 [Thu77]. So, on Xn we have P (m1 , l1 , l2n ) = 0. Let p(m1 , l1 ) and\nd\nq(m1 , l1 ) denote the coefficient of md2P and l2Q in P (m1 , l1 , m2 ) and Q(m1 , l1 , l2 ) respectively.\nLet Rn (m1 , l1 ) \u2208 Q(m1 , l1 ) denote the resultant of P (m1 , l1 , l2n ) and Q(m1 , l1 , l2 ) (both are\nelements of Q(m1 , l1 )[l2 ]) with respect to l2 ; see [Lan02, Sec.IV.8]. It follows that\nY\nRn (m1 , l1 ) = p(m1 , l1 )dQ\nP (m1 , l1 , l2n ) \u2208 Q(m1 , l1 )\nl2 :Q(m1 ,l1 ,l2 )=0\n\nSince Rn (m1 , l1 ) is a Q(m1 , l1 ) linear combination of P (m1 , l1 , l2n ) and Q(m1 , l1 , l2 ) (see\n[Lan02, Sec.IV.8]) and since P (m1 , l1 , l2n ) and Q(m1 , l1 , l2 ) vanish on the irreducible curve\nXn , it follows that An (m1 , l1 ) divides the numerator of Rn (m1 , l1 ). Moreover, by the above\nequation, Rn (m1 , l1 ) is a Q(m1 , l1 )-linear combination of the n-th powers of a finite set of\nelements l2 algebraic over Q(m1 , l1 ). Section 3.3 below implies that Rn satisfies a linear\nrecursion with constant coefficients in Q[m1 , l1 ]. This recursion is valid for all integers n and\nconcludes the proof of Theorem 1.1.\n\u0003\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.3\nsec.thm2\nsub.support\n\n3.1. The support function of a polytope. Let us review some standard facts of Polyhedral Geometry regarding the support function hP of a convex body P in Rr . For a detailed\ndiscussion, see [Sch93, Sec.1.7]. The latter is defined by\nhP : Rr \\ {0} \u2212\u2192 R,\n\nhP (u) = sup{u * x |x \u2208 P }\n\nwhere u * v denotes the standard inner product of two vectors u and v of Rr . Given a unit\nvector u, there is a unique hyperplane with outer normal vector u that touches P , and\nentirely contains P in the left-half space. The value hP (u) of the support function is the\nsigned distance from the origin to the above hyperplane. This is illustrated in the following\n\n\f8\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n\nfigure:\n\nLet us list some useful properties of the support function:\n\u2022 hP uniquely determines the convex body P . This is the famous Minkowski reconstruction theorem.

Generalized power sums and their zeros. Generalized power sums play a key role\nto the LMS theorem. For a detailed discussion, see [vdP89] and also [EvdPSW03].

Observe that the monic polynomial\npolynomial s(x) of smallest possible degree is uniquely determined by (an ).\nThe LMS theorem concerns the zeros of a generalized power sum.\nthm.MLS\n\nTheorem 3.1. [Sko35, Mat02, Lec53] The zero set of a generalized power sum is the union\nof a finite set and a finite set of arithmetic progressions.\nA detailed proof of this important theorem is discussed in [vdP89], for recurrent sequences\nwith values in an arbitrary field of characteristic zero. In the next section we will need a\nslightly stronger form of the LMS theorem. We say that a recurrent sequence (an ) is nondegenerate if the ratio of two distinct roots of (an ) is not a root of unity; see [EvdPSW03,\nSec.1.1.9].\nThe LMS theorem in the case of number fields follows from the following two theorems.\nthm.deg1\n\nTheorem 3.2.

The\nfield E = Q(x) of algebraic functions of x has a valuation v \u2217 (resp. v) given by the minimum\ndegree (resp. maximum degree) with respect to x of a polynomial of x, and then extended\nby additivity to the field of rational functions of x, and further uniquely extended to E, the\nfield of Puiseux series of x; see [Wal78]. Note that if R \u2208 E, then v \u2217 (R) is given by by the\nlowest power of x in the series expansion of R(x) at x = 0. Likewise, v(R) is given by the\nnegative of the lowest power of x in the series expansion of R(1/x) at x = \u221e. For example,\nv \u2217 (x2 + x7 ) = 2,\n\nv(x2 + x7 ) = 7\n\nNow, the general solution of a linear recursion with constant coefficients is of the form\nX\nRn (x) =\nPj (x, n)\u03bbj (x)n\nj\n\nwhere Pj (x, n) \u2208 E[n] is a nonzero polynomial of n of degree mj \u2212 1.

It follows that there exists a natural number M such that for every r\nwith 0 \u2264 r \u2264 M \u2212 1 and every (i, k) \u2208 S, the recurrent sequence ai,k (nM + r) is either zero\nor non-degenerate. It suffices to show that for every r with 0 \u2264 r \u2264 M \u2212 1, v \u2217 (RnM +r (x)) is\na linear function of n, for all but finitely many n.\nIntroduce the well-ordering of S as follows: (i, k) < (i\u2032 , k \u2032 ) if i < i\u2032 or i = i\u2032 and k < k \u2032 .\nSince\nX\neq.RnMk\n(8)\nRnM +r (x) =\nai,k (nM + r)x(nM +r)\u03c9i +k\n(i,k)\u2208S\n\nis nozero for all but finitely many n, it follows that there is a smallest (i, k) \u2208 S such\nthat (ai,k (nM + r)) is not identically zero as a function of n. Since (ai,k (nM + r)) is nondegenerate, Theorem 3.3 implies that {n \u2208 N |ai,k (nM + r) = 0} is a finite set, and for all n\nin its complement, Equation (8) implies that\nv \u2217 (RnM +r (x)) = (nM + r)\u03c9i + k .\nIt follows that the restriction of v \u2217 (Rn (x)) to each arithmetic progression MN + r is a linear\nfunction of n (for all but finitely many n), thus, v \u2217 (Rn (x)) (and likewise, v(Rn (x)) is quasilinear for all but finitely many values of n.\nWe now reduce the general case of Theorem 1.3 to the case of r = 1. Consider a holonomic\n\u00b11\nsequence Rn (x1 , . . . , xr ) \u2208 Q[x\u00b11\n1 , . . . , xr ] nonzero for all but finitely many n, and let Nn\ndenote the Newton polytope of Rn . Fix a general weight vector \u03c9 = (\u03c91 , . . . , \u03c9r ) \u2208 Qr \\ {0},\nand consider the specialization R\u03c9,n (t) = Rn (\u01eb\u03c9 (x)).\nTo state our next lemma, recall the notion of a fan, i.e., a finite collection of rational\npolyhedral cones with vertex at the origin, whose union of their closures covers a fixed\nvector space, and whose interiors are pairwise disjoint; see [Zie95]. Fans are also known as\nconstant coefficient tropical varieties; see [SS09].\nlem.vlambda\n\nLemma 3.1. There exists a fan in Rr such that for every j, the restriction of \u03c9 7\u2192\nv \u2217 (\u03bbj (\u01eb\u03c9 (x)) and \u03c9 7\u2192 v(\u03bbj (\u01eb\u03c9 (x)) to the interior of each maximal cone is a linear function.\nProof. Without loss of generality, we will work with v \u2217 . Write the characteristic polynomial\np(z, x) in terms of its monomials:\nX\np(z, x) =\nc\u03b1,\u03b2 x\u03b1 z \u03b2\n(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2208Zr \u00d7N\n\n\f12\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n\nwhere the sum is finite and c\u03b1,\u03b2 =\n6 0. Let \u03bbj (x) satisfy p(\u03bbj (x), x) = 0. Then, it follows that\nfor each generic \u03c9,\nmin{\u03b1 * \u03c9 + \u03b2v \u2217 (\u01eb\u03c9 (\u03bbj (x)))}\n\u03b1,\u03b2\n\nis achieved at least twice. The result follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nContinuing with the proof of Theorem 1.3, it is easy to see that for generic \u03c9 (for example,\nwhen cd (\u01eb\u03c9 (x)) 6= 0 in Equation (6)), the sequence R\u03c9,n (t) is holonomic, and its Newton\npolygon is given by [\u2212hNn (\u2212\u03c9), hNn (\u03c9)], where hNn is the support function of Nn . This\nfollows from the discussion of Section 3.1. Let \u03c9 lie in the interior of a fixed maximal cone\nof the fan of Lemma 3.1. Lemma 3.1 and the proof of the case of r = 1 implies that for all\nn sufficiently large we have\n(9)\n\neq.homega\n\n\u2212 hNn (\u2212\u03c9) = \u03b4 \u2217 (n) * \u03c9,\n\nhNn (\u03c9) = \u03b4(n) * \u03c9\n\nwhere \u03b4 \u2217 (n) and \u03b4(n) are r-vectors of quasi-linear functions. Of course, \u03b4 \u2217 and \u03b4 depend on\nthe maximal cone of the above fan. Now, fix a large enough n = n0 . Then, Equations (3)\nand (9) imply that for all \u03c9 in the interior of a maximal cone of the fan we have:\nhNn (\u03c9) = \u03b4(n) * \u03c9 = max{\u03c9 * v |v \u2208 VNn }\nBoth are piecewise linear functions of \u03c9 and the one on the right jumps at a hyperplane\nnormal to a facet (i.e., a maximal face) of Nn . It follows that the set of normal vectors of\nthe facets of Nn is a subset of the set of rays of the fan of Lemma 3.1. The latter is a finite\nset independent of n.\nConsequently, Nn is a sequence of polytopes with normal vectors in a fixed finite set, and\nwith h-function that satisfies Equation (9), which is a locally (with respect to \u03c9) quasilinear with respect to n. It follows from the Minknowski recustruction theorem that the\ncoordinates of every vertex of Nn are quasi-linear functions of n, for all but finitely many n.\nThis concludes the proof of Theorem 1.3.\n\u0003\nrem.3\n\nRemark 3.2. The LMS theorem is used in the same way both in the proof of Theorem 1.3,\nand in the proof of [Gar11a, Thm.1]. This is not a coincidence. In fact, a holonomic sequence\nRn (q) \u2208 Q(q) of one variable is also a q-holonomic sequence in the sense of [Zei90, Gar11a],\nsince it satisfies a linear recursion with constant coefficients. The degree of a q-holonomic\nsequence is a quadratic quasi-polynomial (see [Gar11a]), however in the case of constant\ncoefficients the slopes of the corresponding tropical curve are zero, and the degree is a linear\nquasi-polynomial. Thus, the r = 1 case of Theorem 1.3 follows from [Gar11a, Thm.1]. For\ncompleteness, we gave a proof of Theorem 1.3 when r = 1 that avoids the general machinery\nof [Gar11a].\nReferences\n[BNG96]\n[Cal01]\n[CCG+ 94]\n\nDror Bar-Natan and Stavros Garoufalidis, On the Melvin-Morton-Rozansky conjecture, Invent.\nMath. 125 (1996), no. 1, 103\u2013133.\nDanny Calegari, Napoleon in isolation, Proc.
