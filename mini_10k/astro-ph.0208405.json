[4] observed frequency shifts in experiments\nusing high power ultrashort laser pulses; this observation is now common,\nused for analysis and called \"Impulsive Stimulated Raman Scattering\"\n(ISRS)[5, 6, 7]. The theory of ISRS shows that this effect has no intensity\nthreshold [8]. The intensities of the lasers make ISRS non-linear, so that\nthe frequency shifts depend on these intensities; at low intensities, the\neffect becomes linear, so that it is similar to a Doppler effect, except\n\u2217 Laboratoire de physique, Universit de Bourgogne, BP 47870, F-21078 Dijon cedex, France.\nEmail : Jacques.Moret-Bailly@u-bourgogne.fr\n\n1\n\n\ffor a small dispersion. This qualitative difference justifies a new name:\n\"Coherent Raman Effect on time-Incoherent Light\" (CREIL).\nIn the next section, the properties of the CREIL are recalled. In the\nfollowing sections, the influence of each of these properties on the standard\nmodel of quasars is given, solving very simply some problems, in particular\nthe noisy quasars cannot show broad spectral lines.\n\n2 Properties of the \"Coherent Raman Effect on Incoherent Light\" (CREIL).\nAny alternative to the Doppler effect in the vacuum requires a timeincoherence of the light: If, during a certain time, the received frequency\nof a coherent light is lower than the emitted frequency, the number of\ncycles, that is the number of wavelengths between the source and the receiver is increased; as the wavelength is an unit of length, the distance is\nincreased, it is a Doppler effect. Thus, we understand that the length of\nthe pulses of light is critical, the pulses of light must verify the condition\nset by G. L. Lamb when the length of the pulses is a condition for the\nobservation of an optical effect: the \"ultrashort light pulses\", must be\n\"shorter than all relevant time constants\" [9].\nIn an homogeneous gas, two relevant time constants must be longer\nthan the pulses which make the usual incoherent light, that is longer than\nabout 10 nanoseconds:\ni) the collisional time \u03c4 must be longer than 10 ns, for instance \u03c4 =\n100ns. For hydrogen atoms at 10000K, the density of atoms N is N \u2248\n1, 7.1021 atomes/m3 ; for H2 at 100K, N \u2248 2, 4.1022 ; these values are\norders of magnitude because the mean diameter of the atoms depends\non the criterion used to define a collision. This condition allows that all\nmolecules on a wave surface remain in phase and scatter coherent waves\nwhich rebuild wave surfaces identical to the incident wave surfaces: no\nblur of the images.\nii) The period corresponding to the Raman transition must be larger\nthan 10 ns, that is in the radiofrequencies range. As the period of the beats\nof the incident and scattered beams is much longer than the duration of\nthe pulses, the beats do not appear, the incident and scattered beams\ninterfere into a single frequency beam; the frequency shift is proportional\nto the ratio of the amplitudes and to the Raman frequency.\nAlthough the coherent scattering is much more powerful than an incoherent Raman scattering, the previous conditions make CREIL much\nweaker than ISRS which uses dense matter and infrared Raman frequencies; an other source of weakness is that the populations of the levels\ninvolved in the Raman transition are nearly the same because they are\nclose, so that the opposed virtual transitions nearly cancel the shifts that\nthey produce. Thus, it seems impossible to get in the labs long enough\npaths to observe the CREIL while the Universes provides long paths in\nlow pressure gases.\nPrevious papers [10, 11, 12, 13] show that the cosmological redshift\nmay be produced by CREIL if there are, in the average, some active\n\n2\n\n\fmolecules per litre in the intergalactic space; it is a very rough evaluation\nbecause a precise computation would require for each molecule present in\nthe space, the knowledge of a lot of traces of Raman polarisation tensors.\nSuppose that a redshifting gas has absorption lines; the absorption\nby a line occurs from the redshifted frequency to the absolute frequency;\nif the redshift is large, the line is wide and weak. If the gas has many\nabsorption lines, the lines are mixed, they cannot be observed.\nIf ISRS and CREIL were simple Raman effects, the active molecules\nwould be excited, and, without collisions, their de-excitations would be\nslow; ISRS and CREIL are parametric effects which mix the described\nRaman effect with an other which de-excite the molecules and blue-shift\n(an) other beam(s); in ISRS, the other beam is a laser beam, in CREIL,\nits role may be plaid by the thermal radiation which is amplified. In this\nlast case, all frequencies are low, resonant.\n\n3\n\nDistance (age) of the quasars\n\nThe distance and the age of the quasars is deduced from the redshift of\nthe sharp emission or absorption lines, which are the most redshifted lines.\nIt was remarked that the neighbourhood of the most redshifted quasars\ncontains a lot of matter, in particular molecular hydrogen detected by the\n21 cm nuclear spin coupling line. It is reasonable to think that where\nthe pressure is low, the molecular hydrogen is partly ionised by the UV\ninto H+\n2 . This gas cannot be detected by its absorption or emission lines\nbecause it has many relatively weak lines which are shifted during their\nabsorption or emission by the CREIL; if the pressure is high enough to\nproduce collisions which forbid the CREIL, these collisions destroy H+\n2\ntoo quickly to allow its observation.\nThe CREIL distorts the standard scale of distances deduced from the\nredshifts. This scale remains probably good in the intergalactic space,\nbecause there, the redshift is produced by expansion or by the CREIL\nin a nearly homogenous medium; but, where there is much molecular\nhydrogen, in particular in the neighbourhood of the quasars the distances\nmust be strongly reduced.\n\n4\n\nAbsence of broad lines in the loud quasars\n\nSuppose that a quasar has an accretion disk larger, but similar to Saturn's\ndisk, except maybe for an inner part which protects the remainder from\nburning. The friction of the stones on the halo of the quasar charges\nthem, just as the drops of rain are charged in our clouds. While the\nlightnings discharge a volume of our clouds, the discharges of regions of\nthe disk are limited to its plane, so that the electromagnetic field radiated\nby sheet-shaped currents propagate more in the direction of the axis of\nthe disk.\nThe disk is only partly and locally discharged by the lightnings; as the\ndisk is inhomogeneous, the sign of its charges depend on the distance to\nthe quasar; thus, the rotation of the disk produces circular currents which\n\n3\n\n\finduce a magnetic field similar to the field introduced by de Kool and\nBegelman[14]: near the disk, its orientation may change, so that it may\nhave zero values, in particular if the disk has gaps.\nRaman transitions inside a Zeeman structure of the hydrogen atom\nrequire a principal quantum number larger than one, that is the atom\nmust have been excited by a Lyman absorption; then the excited atom is\nactive for CREIL were the magnetic field is not null; for atoms pumped by\na Lyman \u03b1 transition, neglecting the electronic spin, and supposing that\nthe de-exciting Raman component is very strong, the computation of the\nCREIL requires only the trace of a single, simple Raman polarisability\ntensor. If the Lyman lines are redshifted while they are absorbed, they\nappear so wide and weak that they cannot be seen.\nIf a line of sight makes large enough an angle with the axis of the\nquasar, it crosses places where the magnetic field is nearly zero, so that,\nas there is no CREIL in these places, the absorption of the Lyman lines\nis stable in the spectrum and the lines appear. The large width of the\nlines may be a consequence of a low CREIL (by a low magnetic field,\nor collisional decrease), or, as this process is close to the quasar, it may\ndepend slightly on the line of sight. This description of the origin of the\nBAL applies to the BEL.\nThus, the loudness, the presence of broad lines is not a property of\nthe quasars, but depends on the direction of observation: BAL quasars,\nobserved in the direction nearly perpendicular to the axis of the disk,\ncannot radiate much electromagnetic field in this direction so that they\nare \"quiet\".\n\n5\n\nThe Lyman forest\n\nIn the standard model, the Lyman forest corresponds to clouds, that is\nto variations of the density of hydrogen atoms. It may be the result of\nthe absorption in a chemically homogenous medium and a space-variable\nredshifting power of the gas resulting of variations of the magnetic (or\nelectric) field. But how could a space-variable magnetic field be generated\nin the far halo? Maybe by electric instabilities in the plasma, or it could\nbe the magnetic part of an extremely low frequency electromagnetic field\nradiated by the quasar and propagating very slowly in the plasma, more\nprobably by magnetised satellites of the quasar.\nIn one of these hypotheses, the modulation of the absorption which\nstructures the Lyman forest is self-amplifying: Follow the light; if, in a\nregion, the magnetic field is very low, there is no redshift, the Lyman \u03b1 line\nsaturates, so that, in the following region there is no Lyman \u03b1 pumping,\nthus no CREIL even if a magnetic field appears; a high magnetic field is\nnecessary to shift the spectrum by a small number of remaining CREILactive atoms ( hydrogen pumped by other Lyman lines, and other atoms).\nWhen the line is shifted of a fraction of its linewidth, the Lyman \u03b1, the\nCREIL and the redshift become strong, the absorption is spread and seems\nlow in the spectrum; a return to the saturation requires a low magnetic\nfield. This discussion is valid where the forest is saturated, but its results\n\n4\n\n\fremain true elsewhere: only small fluctuations of the field may induce the\nforest.\nTwo effects explain that the density of lines in the high redshift region\nof the forest generally decreases: i) the density of hydrogen being higher\nand its illumination higher, the CREIL is larger, the spectrum is spread,\nso that the decrease is an artefact; ii) in this region, some small satellites\nmay fall into the accretion disk.\nAlong a line of sight, the frequencies are shifted near the magnetic\nsatellites while the Lyman lines are written far from these satellites. When\nan eclipse is observed by a variation of the intensity of the quasar, if small\nvariations of the redshift can be detected, the gap corresponding to the\nsatellite in the Lyman forest may be found. It could help a study of the\nsatellite and the quasar.\n\n6\n\nHigh redshift quasars\n\nThe high redshift quasars appear in regions of the Universe in which clouds\nof molecular hydrogen are detected by the nuclear spin coupling transition\nat 21 cm. They seem dusty too.\nIf the pressure of molecular hydrogen allows a very long collisional\ntime, the UV ionises a part of the hydrogen into H+\n2 which is active in\nCREIL, thus cannot be observed from its absorption or emission spectra.\nThe CREIL increases the redshift of the quasar; it amplifies the thermal\nradiation, possibly up to 100K, so that this thermal radiation may be\nconfused with radiation of hot dust.\nIf a galaxy appears next to a quasar, and has a lower redshift, it may,\nhowever, be further than the quasar. Thus its line of sight may cross the\nneighbourhood of the quasar, so that absorptions of metal lines may have\nthe same origin, appear with the same redshift.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nThis draft intends only to show that taking the Coherent Raman Effect on\ntime-Incoherent Light (CREIL) into account solves very easily, without\nany new physics or new matter, problems which appear in the study of\nthe quasars: - the absence of BAL lines in the loud quasars is deduced\nfrom the hypothesis of a disk similar to Saturn's; - the discrepancies in the\nobserved spectra may be produced by the small dispersion of the CREIL;\n- the quasars are younger than they seem, so that they can contain metals\nmade in old stars.\nThe use of CREIL allows to find several explanations of a particular\nobservation; the present qualitative study must be specified quantitatively\nto choose the best explanation, maybe the standard explanation: for instance the thermal radiation may be partly produced by hot dust, partly\nby CREIL. Having several possible solutions is better than having none !\nThe model of quasars which takes CREIL into account uses only commonly observed types of astrophysical objects and simple regular physics;\n\n5\n\n\fwith much less work, it seems to give interpretations of observations on the\nquasars better than the standard model; it does not require dark matter,\nbut if this matter is necessary for the gravitational stability, it proposes\npartially ionised H2 . Logically, is it acceptable to neglect CREIL a priori?\nThe present demonstration of the necessity to take CREIL into account\nin astrophysics weakens the two main proofs of the big bang, expansion\nand 2.7K radiation.\n\nReferences\n[1] Webb J., V.
