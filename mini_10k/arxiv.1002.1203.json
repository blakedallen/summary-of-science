To the best of our knowledge, this is the only\navailable report in this regard.\nIt was argued in the previous work29 that the reactions of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) with small alcohol\nmolecules at room temperature proceeds via a mechanism of hydrogen abstraction, which\nwas based on the bond dissociation energy (BDE)36-38 and linear free energy37 correlations\n\n-2-\n\n\ftogether with an ab initio calculation performed on the reaction of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) with CH3OH.\nNoteworthy is that the BDE correlation of alcohols given in that work was performed only\nagainst corresponding alkanes.29 Nevertheless, it has been well recognized that an H/D\nisotopomerization based BDE correlation can usually be more straightforward and\nreliable.39-45\nWe present here for the first time a detailed examination of deuterium kinetic isotope\neffect as well as temperature dependence for the reaction of C 2 (a 3\u03a0 u ) + methanol , aiming to\nelucidate its reaction mechanism.

The observed kinetic isotope effects, k1/k2\nand k1/k3, along with their temperature dependences are put in detail.\n\nExperimental\nThe experiment was performed under slow-flow conditions by means of pulsed laser\nphotolysis/laser induced fluorescence technique described in detail elsewhere.26-30 Briefly,\nthe C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) radicals were produced by photolysis of C2Cl4 using the fourth harmonic\n\n-3-\n\n\foutput (266 nm, typical energy ~5.5 mJ/pulse, repetition rate 10 Hz) of a Nd:YAG laser\n(INDI, Spectra Physics). An f = 500 mm lens was used to focus the photolysis laser beam\ninto the center of the stainless steel flow reactor. The probe laser used was a Nd:YAG laser\n(GCR-170, Spectra Physics) pumped dye laser (PrecisionScan, Sirah) whose output energy\nwas chosen to be ~1.5 mJ/pulse. The dye laser beam was set collinear to the photolysis\nlaser beam in a counter-propagating way and its diameter was confined to ~1 mm in order to\neffectively suppress the scattered light.\nThe C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) concentrations were probed by exciting the d 3 \u03a0 g \u2190 a 3\u03a0 u 0-0 transition\nat 516.5 nm11 and detecting the dye laser induced fluorescence (LIF) on the 0-1 vibronic\ntransition band which was isolated with an interference filter at 563.5 nm. The LIF signal\nwas collected by a photomultiplier tube (R928, Hamamatsu) whose output was recorded by a\ndigital oscilloscope (TDS380, Tektronix) and then averaged over 256 laser pulses with a\ncomputerized data acquisition system.\n\nA digital delay generator (DG535, Stanford\n\nResearch) was used to vary the time delay between the photolysis and probe laser pulses.\nTemperatures of the resistively heated flow reactor were controlled over the range 293 \u2212\n673 K by a temperature regulator (AI-708P, Xiamen) and measured by a K-type\nthermocouple probe mounted a few millimeters away from the center of the reactor. The\ncontrolled temperatures were found to be within a \u00b10.5 K precision over the dimensions of\nthe probed volume and the experimental duration.\nIn a typical experiment, three channels of gas flow including premixed C2Cl4/Ar,\nmethanol/Ar, and pure argon gas slowly passed through the reaction cell and were measured\nindependently by three calibrated mass flow controllers (D07-7A/2M, Beijing).\n\n-4-\n\nThe\n\n\fconcentrations of methanol reactants can be calculated by\n\n[methanol] = 9.66 \u00d7 1018\n\np f methanol/Ar xmethanol/Ar\n,\nT\nf total\n\n(5)\n\nwhere [methanol] is the concentration of methanol reactant (in molecules cm-3), p and T are\nthe pressure (Torr) and temperature (K) of the system, fmethanol/Ar and ftotal are the flow rates of\nmethanol/Ar and all gases, respectively, and xmethanol/Ar is the pressure ratio of methanol over\nAr. All the experiment was performed over the temperature range 293 \u2212 673K and at a total\npressure of ~9.5 Torr to maintain a steady flow condition.\nThe C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) radicals generated from the laser photolysis of the precursor C2Cl4\nmolecules are rotationally hot. The Ar buffer gas was included in the reaction mixtures in\norder to cool C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) radicals rotationally and translationally as well as to slow down the\ndiffusion of molecules out of the detection region.18\n\nThe LIF decay of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) was\n\nmeasured after C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) is rotationally cooled to room temperature. Under the above\nexperimental conditions, since the C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) radicals were found to be rotationally cooled to\nroom temperature within a delay time of ~8 \u03bcs between the photolysis and probe laser\npulses,26-30 the kinetic data were collected at times slightly longer than 8 \u03bcs.\nThe chemicals used in the experiment were as follows: C2Cl4 (\u226598.5%, Shanghai),\nmethanol (\u226599.5%, Shanghai), methanol-d (isotopic purity 99.0% at% D, Acros),\nmethanol-d3 (99.5% at% D, Acros), methanol-d4 (99.8% at% D, Aldrich). All samples were\ndegassed by repeated freeze-pump-thaw cycles in liquid nitrogen. Ar (99.999%, Nanjing\ngas) was used without further purification.\n\nResults and discussion\n-5-\n\n\fIn the present study, the UV laser photolysis of C2Cl4 produces C2 radicals in both X1\u03a3 g+\nand a 3\u03a0 u states. Since the singlet and triplet states of C2 are quite close in energy,10\npopulation transfer between the two states through collisions either with the carrier gas (Ar)\nor with the co-reagent methanol molecules can occur via intersystem crossing.18,20,33\nAlthough such a collision-induced quenching process cannot be distinguished from reaction\nin the present work, it can be justified to be negligible compared to reaction based on the\nfollowing considerations.\n\nOn the one hand, an upper limit of rate coefficient for the\n\na 3\u03a0 u \u2192 X1\u03a3 g+ transfer by Ar has been determined to be 3 \u00d7 10-14 cm3 molecule-1 s-1,18 which\n\nis roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that obtained for reactions in this work. On\nthe other hand, as a singlet quencher consisting of light atoms, methanol molecule cannot\ninduce significant intersystem crossing due to the fact that spin conservation rules work\nrather well for light species.18,20\n\nIn addition, C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) was found to be virtually produced\n\nin its vibrational levels up to \u03c5 = 3 (as verified by the LIF excitation spectrum of the C2 Swan\nbands we obtained in the wavelength range 506 \u2013 518 nm). The buffer gas Ar used in this\nexperiment ensures rapid rotational and translational equilibration, however it cannot\nefficiently quench vibrational excitation as He or N2 does.18,20\nto be rather efficient at removing \u03c5 = 1 population.13\n\nIn contrast, CH4 was found\n\nNevertheless, with the exception of\n\nthe C2 + O2 reaction, rate coefficients were demonstrated to be identical using N2 and CH4\nbuffer gases, ruling out any artifacts in the rate data due to filling of \u03c5 = 0 from upper\nlevels.13\n\nAs in this case, although only the disappearance of \u03c5 = 0 was monitored in the\n\npresent work, the vibrationally hot C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) does not complicate the interpretation of the\nmeasured rates.\n\n-6-\n\n\fSimilar to our previous work,26-30 the validity of pseudo-first-order kinetics was ensured\nthroughout all the measurements presented here by keeping the partial pressure of the C2Cl4\nprecursor always much lower than that of the methanol reactants. Under such a condition,\nthe LIF decay of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) at long times (>8 \u03bcs) follows\nI = I 0 exp(\u2212 k ' t ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k\u2032 is the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the total loss of the C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) LIF signal I\ndue to all processes including reactions and diffusion out of the probe region, and t is the\ntime delay between the photolysis and probe lasers.\n\nFig. 1 shows a typical time-resolved\n\nLIF decay profile for the co-reagent species CH3OD with a concentration of 1.42 \u00d7 1015\nmolecules cm-3 at 573 K.\n\nBy varying reactant concentrations we obtained the\n\ncorresponding k\u2032 values through exponential fits using eqn (6).\nAs a result of the pseudo-first-order kinetics, k\u2032 at a certain concentration of methanol\nunder investigation is given by\nk ' = k[methanol] + kn ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k is the bimolecular rate constant for the reaction of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) with methanol, and kn is\nthe loss rate of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) due to the reactions and diffusion in the absence of methanol.\nLinear least-squares fit of k\u2032 versus [methanol] therefore yields the bimolecular rate constant\nk for the reaction of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) with methanol. Fig. 2, as an example, shows plots of k\u2032 as a\nfunction of the concentrations of CH3OH, CD3OH, CH3OD, and CD3OD at 373, 373, 473\nand 473 K, respectively, all of which exhibit excellent linear relationship.\nTable 1 lists the obtained bimolecular rate constants (in the units 10-12 cm3 molecule-1 s-1,\nwithin \u00b12\u03c3 errors) for the reactions of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) with four isotopomers of methanol including\n\n-7-\n\n\fCH3OH (k1), CH3OD (k2), CD3OH (k3), and CD3OD (k4) over the temperature range 293 \u2212\n673 K.\nThe rate constants measured over the temperature range 293 \u2013 673 K for reaction (1),\nk1(T), are plotted in Fig. 3. Also included in Fig. 3, for comparison purposes, are the\npreviously reported data measured at room temperature (shown as the open diamond),29 with\nwhich the present room-temperature measurement is in reasonably good agreement. The fit\nof the temperature dependent k1 data (in the units cm3 molecule-1 s-1) to Arrhenius equation\nof the normal form k1(T) = A exp(-E/RT) yields\nk1(T) = (1.32 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10-11 exp[-(366.80 \u00b1 4.44)/T],\n\n(8)\n\nwhich shows clearly an excellent linear relationship on the semi-logarithm scale.\n\nThe\n\nappearance of a positive temperature dependence (i.e., a positive activation energy as shown\nin eqn (8)) indicates that there exists an energy barrier along the reaction coordinate, which in\nturn implies that a hydrogen abstraction instead of an insertion mechanism most probably\ntakes place in the course of the reaction.20\nIn an attempt to gain more insights into the reaction mechanism, we further examined the\nkinetic isotope effects by replacing CH3OH with deuterated CH3OD, CD3OH, and CD3OD.\nThe rate constants measured over the temperature range 293 \u2013 673 K for reaction (2),\nk2(T), are also plotted in Fig. 3. The Arrhenius fit of k2 data (in the units cm3 molecule-1 s-1)\nreads\nk2(T) = (1.34 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10-11 exp[-(376.86 \u00b1 5.09)/T].\n\n(9)\n\nAs can be readily seen from Fig. 3, k2 exhibits a positive temperature dependence almost\nidentical to that of k1 and k2(T) \u2248 k1(T) at each corresponding temperature, i.e., deuterium\n\n-8-\n\n\fsubstitution at the hydroxyl site has minor effect on the reaction kinetics in the temperature\nrange under investigation.\nFig. 4 plots the rate constants k3(T) measured over the temperature range 293 \u2013 673 K for\nreaction (3) as well as k1(T) for reaction (1) for comparison purposes. The Arrhenius fit of\nk3 data (in the units cm3 molecule-1 s-1) yields\nk3(T) = (1.09 \u00b1 0.02) \u00d7 10-11 exp[-(640.00 \u00b1 7.23)/T],\n\n(10)\n\nwhich gives an activation energy ~74% larger than that of reaction (1). It is apparent from\nFig. 4 that the values of k3(T) are smaller than those of k1(T) at each corresponding\ntemperature and k3(T) varies with temperature more dramatically than k1(T) does, strongly\nindicating that deuterium substitution from the methyl instead of hydroxyl site has\npronounced effect on the reaction kinetics involved.\nNow that the reaction kinetics is found to be overwhelmingly affected by the methyl\nrather than hydroxyl group in methanol, one would expect that the kinetics of the C2( a 3\u03a0 u )\nreaction with the fully deuterated methanol, CD3OD, i.e., reaction (4) may behave quite\nsimilarly to that of reaction (3). Plotted in Fig. 5 are the rate constants measured over the\ntemperature range 293 \u2013 673 K for reaction (4), k4(T). Fitting k4 data (in the units cm3\nmolecule-1 s-1) in the Arrhenius form gives\nk4(T) = (1.12 \u00b1 0.01) \u00d7 10-11 exp[-(666.37 \u00b1 4.63)/T].\n\n(11)\n\nAgain, the positive temperature dependence of k4 appears almost identical to that of k3 which\nis also plotted in Fig. 5, as in the case for the comparison of k2 with k1 (Fig. 3) described\nabove. In addition, k4(T) \u2248 k3(T) at each corresponding temperature. All this further points\nto the fact that deuterium substitution at the hydroxyl site barely affects the reaction kinetics\n\n-9-\n\n\fover the temperature range 293 \u2013 673 K.\nIt is worth noting that although k1 slightly differs from k2 and the same holds for k3 and k4\n(as can be discerned from Fig. 3 and 5, respectively), the sums k1 + k4 and k2 + k3 (compiled\nin Table 2) are found to be equal, for all temperatures between 293 and 673 K, to within an\naverage deviation of ~0.3%, i.e., the four temperature dependences sum to provide internally\nconsistent results. The equality of\nk1 + k4 = k2 + k3\n\n(12)\n\nsuggests that the separation by reactive sites can work well for the reactions (1) \u2013 (4), i.e., the\nfollowing assumptions are rational:45\n\nand\n\nk1 = kCH 3 + kOH ,\n\n(13)\n\nk2 = kCH 3 + kOD ,\n\n(14)\n\nk3 = kCD 3 + kOH ,\n\n(15)\n\nk4 = kCD 3 + kOD ,\n\n(16)\n\nhence k1/k3 can be thought of as reflecting principally kCH 3 / kCD 3 .44\nThe deuterium kinetic isotope effects, k1/k2 and k1/k3, display different temperature\ndependences that are plotted as log(k1/k2) and log(k1/k3) versus 1000/T in Fig. 6 and listed in\nTable 3, from which one can readily detect that k1/k2 keeps constant (~1.00) throughout the\nentire temperature range, whereas k1/k3 falls in a range of 1.8 \u2013 3.1 and exhibits a clear\nnegative temperature dependence with a best-fit expression of the form\nk1/k3(T) = (1.22 \u00b1 0.03) exp[(271.80 \u00b1 11.70)/T].\n\n(17)\n\nSuch a negative temperature dependence is a straightforward outcome of the fact that the\nactivation energy of reaction (1) is smaller than that of reaction (3) [cf. eqn (8) and (10)],\n\n- 10 -\n\n\fwhich can be simply translated to that the C-H bond is more vulnerable to attack by C2( a 3 \u03a0 u )\nthan the C-D bond. This is explicitly correlated with BDE of the C-H and C-D bonds as it\nis well known that the former is smaller than the latter.44\nThe above analyses can be sorted out and summarized as follows: (i) Over the\ntemperature range 293 \u2013 673 K the observed deuterium kinetic isotope effects, k1(T) \u2248 k2(T)\nand k3(T) \u2248 k4(T), indicate conclusively that the hydroxyl group in methanol is an\n\"uninvolved\" reactive site and it, whether being deuterated or not, does not affect the reaction\nkinetics at its neighboring site, namely CH3 or CD3; (ii) The experimental observations of k3,\nk4(T) < k1, k2(T) over the temperature range 293 \u2013 673 K, together with (i), enable us to argue\nthat the rate constants k strongly correlate with BDE of the C-H(D) bonds because deuterium\nsubstitution occurring at the \"involved\" reactive methyl site dramatically slows down the\nreaction of C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) with methanol; (iii) Based on the experimental observations that all the\nrate constants k(T) show a positive temperature dependence, together with (ii), a conclusion\ncan be drawn that a site-specific hydrogen abstraction from the methyl group in methanol\ndoes indeed dominate reactivity over the temperature range under investigation, because if\nthe reaction proceeds by C2( a 3\u03a0 u ) insertion into a C-H bond of the methanol one would\nexpect that the reaction usually exhibits a negative temperature dependence and appears to\nshow no kinetic isotope effect.46-49\n\nConclusion\nWe have presented a first temperature dependence and kinetic isotope effect study on the\nreaction of C2( a 3 \u03a0 u ) with methanol.\n\nThe bimolecular rate constants for a series of\n\n- 11 -\n\n\fmethanol isotopomers have been measured as a function of temperature between 293 and 673\nK. The observed positive temperature dependences as well as deuterium kinetic isotope\neffects permit determination of the reaction mechanism as a site-specific hydrogen\nabstraction from the methyl rather than hydroxyl site.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China\n(Grant Nos. 20673107 and 20873133), the Ministry of Science and Technology of China\n(Grant Nos. 2007CB815203 and 2010CB923302), the Chinese Academy of Sciences\n(KJCX2-YW-N24), and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas\nChinese Scholars, Ministry of Education of China.\n\n- 12 -\n\n\fReferences\n1\n\nA.
