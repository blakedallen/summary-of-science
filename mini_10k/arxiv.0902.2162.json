The principle of the scheme is rather general and can be applied to other problems like\ndetection of entanglement coming from non-i.i.d sources.\n\nIntroduction .- The problem of ,,locality vs nonlocality\" was usually treated under the assumption that the\ninformation source is one which emits signals that are\nindependent from each other. Such sources can be described by a sequence of identical and independently distributed (i.i.d.) random variables. However there may\nexist sources for which the assumption may not work for\npurely physical reasons. The main idea of the paper is\nto propose a simple scheme for detection of nonlocality\nvia Bell inequalities (or detection of quantum entanglement in terms of witnesses) in (in general multipartite)\nsystems which are non i.i.d, but have some type of classical (but not quantum) memory. Let us mention the first\napproach to non i.i.d. sources was proposed in Ref. [1] in\nterms of entropic quantities and then developed for entanglement measures [2] and classical capacities [3] (see\nalso Ref. [4]). Here however we are focused on qualitative\ndetection of quantum properties like nonlocality and entanglement. In particular the nonlocality detection needs\nto be more rigorous. The key notion - in contrary to standard approach to nonlocality - is the program that is independent from Alice and Bob settings (that are chosen\nrandomly) and allow to subselect the substrings of the\n,,truly\" nonlocal (or ,,truly\" entangled ) data. Usually\nwe shall assume that the source has no prior information\nabout Alice and Bob settings choices. We show how this\nassumption can be relaxed in some cases. We discuss the\nresult for bipartite case, however the scheme works also\nfor multipartite versions.\nScenario and the main idea.- In bipartite version the\nscenario we consider involves spatially separated Alice\nand Bob and a source S. The source is not specified, apart\nfrom the assumptions, that for each N it provides Alice\nand Bob a sequence of N objects each of which both of\nthem can measure, and it does not have access to their\nsettings. The task of Alice and Bob is to check if the\nsource can be turned into a one which does not admit an\nLHV model.\nLet us remind that in particular the source need not\nlead to independent and identically distributed random\nvariables, as assumed in usual Bell inequality tests. We\nare rather closer to the new paradigm that has been con-\n\nsidered only recently in [5], where the source can be totally empowered by the eavesdropper Eve. However we\ndo not adopt the idea of symmetrization used there, since\nfor certain patterns of memory the source which is quite\nuseful, would be claimed to be useless, as admitting an\nLHV model. Exemplary source is the one which is 'local' and 'nonlocal' alternately, corresponding to e.g. an\nunstable device.\nThe idea is quite simple. If Alice and Bob observe,\nthat their data do not violate given Bell inequality, they\nare not yet lost. They can try to design a proper program such that after processing of their (classical) data,\nthey will observe the violation. By program we mean\nany algorithm written for any (classical, quantum, hybrid or other) machine that filters some events i.e. instructs which outcomes of measurements should be taken\ninto account, and which to be discarded. By proper, we\nmean that the program is independent from the settings\n(choices of measurements involved in Bell inequality test)\nbut in principle it may depend on some other data like\nsome additional measurement results (as long as they are\nsettings-independent too) or even laboratory conditions,\nweather etc. This aspect is common with the original\nconcept of hidden nonlocality [6, 7]. The later is included in our model as a special case, however in the\npresent analysis we shall focus on programs dependent\non Bell experiment events only, which is still vital since\nwe deal with non i.i.d. sources.\nIn other words, if Alice and Bob have access to a source\nS which appears to be not directly useful, sometimes\nthey can transform it into a useful one. It can be written\nsymbolically as S \u2032 = S+P where P is their program which\n'filters' objects coming from S.\nTo make the work with programs more easy, we first\nallow for Alice and Bob to transform their data into a\nbinary string, which is called g. The more 1's in the\nstring, the more probable it is to violate the Bell inequality. Hence the program P should be chosen such that it\ninstructs about as much of those entries of the string g\nwhich have 1, as it is possible, without being dependent\nfrom the settings in Bell experiment. A substring of g\ntaken in positions indicated by P forms a string called g'.\n\n\f2\nOne may be also interested what happens if the program\nis somewhat correlated with the settings. As we shall\nshow if the string g' is compressible enough, i.e. has low\nKolmogorow complexity, and observed violation on g' is\nhigh enough, we still may exclude LHV in original source.\nIn what follows, the letter in bold such as g will denote\nstrings. The letters with indices such as gi will denote\nparticular values of the i-th entry of the string. A bold\ncapital letter will denote random variable.\nSequence g- the idea of binary G function.- Consider\nan arbitrary linear two-partite Bell inequality, for correlations of local outcomes observed at measurement stations\nof Alice (A) and Bob (B) in the following form which\navoids absolute values:\nX\n\u03b1(x, y, a, b)P (a, b|x, y) \u2264 R.\n(1)\na,b,x,y\n\nHere x and y stand for the measurement settings chosen\nby Alice and Bob respectively, and a and b for the outcomes of their measurements, P (a, b|x, y) represents conditional probabilities and R is the local realistic bound.\nNote that any linear Bell inequality can be brought to the\nabove form written in such a form with \u03b1(x, y, a, b) \u2265 0\nsince each inequality which has some negative \u03b1's can be\nrewritten by substituting probabilities which stand by\nnegative \u03b1's by unity minus the probability of the opposite events. With further notation\n\u03b1(x, y, a, b) = P (x, y)C(x, y, a, b)G(a, b, x, y)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere C(a, b, x, y) is any real, positive function and\nG(a, b, x, y) \u2208 {0, 1} (1) becomes\nXX\nC(a, b, x, y)G(a, b, x, y)P (a, b, x, y) \u2264 R (3)\nx,y a,b\n\nWhen one wants to experimentally find the value of\nthe LHS of (3) one does N runs of the experiment and\napproximates\nPN\n\u03b4a ,a \u03b4bi ,b \u03b4xi ,x \u03b4yi ,y\n(4)\nP (a, b, x, y) \u2248 i=1 i\nN\nwhere variables with index i correspond to the values\nobtained in the i-th run of the experiment. When we\nplug this to (3) we get\nN\nX\ni=1\n\nCi Gi \u2264 RN\n\n(5)\n\nwith abbreviations Ci = C(ai , bi , xi , yi ) and Gi =\nG(ai , bi , xi , yi ). The form (5) is very useful since it is\nclearly seen which run of the experiment raises the value\nof the LHS (the ones with G = 1) so if one would like to\nmake some postselection to increase the LHS one needs\nto choose these runs. The string of N values of G will be\ndenoted as g: g= (G1 , G2 , ..., GN ).\n\nChoosing a substring with nonlocal properties - the\nidea of the d string .- Let us assume that the strings\nc=(C1 , ..., CN ) and g=(G1 , ..., GN ) be such that they do\nnot violate (5) but there exists a subset of indexes i \u2208 I\nsuch that\nX\nCi Gi \u2264 RN \u2032\n(6)\ni\u2208I\n\nis violated, where N \u2032 is the cardinality of the set I. The\nfull description of I can be done with the help of the\nstring d \u2208 {0, 1}N of length N , where [d]i = 1 if i \u2208 I\nand [d]i = 0 if i \u2208\n/ I. In what follows, string will be\nthe output of program P. We will need also notation for\nsubstring of g indicated by d which will be denoted as\ng\u2032 = (Gd(1) , ..., Gd(N \u2032 ) ).\nThe idea of the main result .- From the construction of\ninequality (5) it is clear, that if the source admits LHV\nmodel, then the string g satisfies this inequality. However, if g satisfies the inequality, the source that led to\ng may still violate the LHV model. We will provide now\nsufficient condition for this violation. Namely, the latter\ntakes place if there is a binary string d such that substring g' of g taken at positions imposed by d violates\ninequality (5) and d can be reproduced by a program\nwhich is independent from the settings. Of course, this\nfact should hold repetitively, that is Alice and Bob in\norder to test the source need to repeat the experiment\nk times for sequence of length N . The number k need\nnot be large so that the probability that they can safely\nclaim to see the source without LHV model is close to 1.\nThe programs .- In practice of laboratory, by a program we will mean any sequence of instructions written in\nany language on a personal computer, a hybrid classicalquantum computer, or any other machine. What is only\nimportant is that the program instruct (each N ) how\nto transform an input string g of length N into output\nN \u2032 length string g' formed from the subset of indices 1\nthrough N (one can think about the program as a transition function of a deterministic Turing Machine) [8].\nWe will actually not need its particular form, but can\nconsider it indeed as collection of some functions transforming input into output. Thus, we adopt the following\ndefinition:\nDefinition 1 A program P is a sequence of algorithms\nwith their inputs given by N -bit sequences g and the outputs formed by binary N -bit sequences d.\nA program is independent from a random variable V if\nfor each N the random variable P of its output (induced\nby random variable of an input) is independent from V\ni.e.\n(out)\n\n\u2200w(out) P r(V = v|P = wN\n\n) = P r(V = v).\n\n(7)\n\nN\n\n(out)\n\nwhere wN\nranges the set of outputs of the program P\nof length N respectively.\n\n\f3\nThere are two extreme examples of the programs,\nwhich clarify the idea of this (in)dependence defined\nabove, as describe below.\nA negative Example.- Consider the following program:\n\"for an input containing length-N g string\noutput d = g.\".\nThis program returns the string d\nwhich describes the substring g' with exactly all those\nvalues of g where function G indicates correlations in\nthe experiment. It is therefore highly dependent from its\ninput. Indeed from the output one can reproduce the\nwhole input string g. Such a program is cheating from\nour point of view, as its output can not be taken into\naccount in context of violation of the Bell inequality: a\nproper post-selection can always lead to its 'violation'.\nIn what follows we will first focus on programs which\nare independent from the variable of settings. Let us note\nhowever, that if the input string is not correlated with\nthe settings, the program (if it is short) can not be too\nmuch correlated with the settings. We develop this case\nin the reminder of this paper.\nA positive Example.- For positive case, consider a family of constant programs P which output the same string\nindependently on their inputs. It describes what we shall\ncall the simple program:\n\"for input containing any N-length string d\noutput the fixed binary string d\".\nWe have then the following observation, the proof of\nwhich is obvious:\nObservation 1 Simple program acting on input g is independent from the settings (X,Y).\nTesting procedure and the main result.- Alice and Bob\nwill perform certain testing procedure. If the procedure\npasses the test, the source with a high probability does\nnot admit the LHV model. The parameter \u01eb > 0 will\ncapture accuracy of this test. The procedure will be just\nsampling performed on the blocks of signals taken from\nthe source. A good event will be if a given block of length\nN violates inequality (5) by a constant r \u2265 r0 with r0 > 0\ndescribing the threshold of violation (i.e. one expects\n(R + r0 ) on the LHS of (5)). They will choose randomly\nk out of K blocks. If the amount of good events is satisfactory they accept the source as characterized by the\nprogram P0 , and abort the protocol otherwise. By satisfactory we mean that the rest of untested blocks (not all\nof which need to violate (5)) still violate the inequality\nwhen P0 applied to them.\nFormally, Alice and Bob can proceed few times according to the following procedure:\n1. Produce binary string g of length N .\n2. Choose a program P0 which does not depend on\nsettings (for usual Bell inequalities approach, P0 is just\nan identity permutation)\n3. Check if the output of P0 on g indicates N \u2032 length\nsubstring g' of g that violates inequality (5) by r \u2265 r0 >\n0, and abort otherwise.\n\n4. Take Ntotal = N \u00d7 K more results from the source.\nChoose randomly k blocks of length N each. For each of\nthem perform step 3 and count the 'yes' answers.\n5. If the number kgood of 'yes' answers satisfies:\nR\nkgood\n+ \u01eb,\n\u2265\nk\nR + r0\n\n(8)\n\naccept, and reject otherwise.\nLet us check that the condition given above guarantees\nviolation of the Bell inequalities by the untested blocks\nwhen P0 applied to them. The number Kgood of good\nevents in remaining (untested) part of string of blocks\ncan be estimated by sampling lemma ([11]) as Kgood \u2265\nk\n\u2212 \u01eb)(K \u2212 k). By linearity of (5) we can add K \u2212 k\n( good\nk\nviolation parameters obtained for each block processed\nby P0 . For the K \u2212 k \u2212 Kgood blocks we put the worst\ncase, that there is not only no violation but just LHS of\n(5) is zero. The violation of the untested string is then\nlower bounded by Kgood \u00d7 (R + r0 )N \u2032 . Hence, by the\nabove inequality, we obtain that the total violation of a\nstring of length N \u2032 \u00d7 (K \u2212 k) (the output of K \u2212 k times\nprocessed blocks by P0 ) has the LHS of the inequality\nbounded from below by\n(\n\nkgood\n\u2212 \u01eb)(K \u2212 k)(R + r0 )N \u2032\nk\n\n(9)\n\nTo have violation of (5) for a string of length K \u2212 k, we\nneed the above value to be not less than (K \u2212 k)\u00d7 N \u2032 \u00d7 R\nwhich gives the desired bound (8).\nWhat we aim to show is that we deal here with 'true'\nviolation, i.e. that the program does not create itself the\nviolating data, but rather extracts the violating string.\nWe are ready to provide the main result of this paper.\nTheorem 1 If the source S passes the testing procedure\nthat involves program P0 , the source S which has access\nto program P0 does not admit the LHV model with a high\nprobability.\nProof.- By the very assumption about sources, S is independent from the variable of settings (X, Y ). Since by\npoint 1 of testing procedure P0 is also independent from\nsettings, we can safely claim, that S with access to program P0 is a valid source, where by access we mean, that\nthe output of S is filtered by P0 (only those signals which\nare idicating by string d are passed). It is now sufficient\nto check, that Alice and Bob observe Bell violation from\ntheir block-wise postprocessing. It is easy to see that the\ntesting procedure is independent from settings as well,\nand can be treated as a soubprocedure of P0 . By considerations below its definition (a consequence of points\n3 \u2212 5), we obtain that source S equipped with a program\nP0 (or - equivalently - Alice and Bob with this program,\nhaving access to the source) violates the Bell inequality.\nThe probability that the procedure succeeds approaches\n1 is exponentially fast in the number of \u221atested blocks k\nof in testing procedure providing k \u2208 O( K).\n\n\f4\nSimple example .- An elementary example is a quantum source sending infinite sequence with even (odd)\ntwo-qubit system in maximally entangled |\u03a8+ i (separable (I \u2212 |\u03a8+ ih\u03a8+ |)/3) state. Observer testing standard CHSH inequality will get averages of separable twoqubit Werner state which will obviously obey the inequality. However the following program P: \"take d with\n[d]i = 0 ([d]i = 1) for the index i even (odd)\" will\npass the above testing procedure\nwith maximal violation\n\u221a\nof the inequality (R = 2 2) which immediately the presence of LHV in the source.\nBounds on programs correlated with settings .- Sometimes it may happen that the program P is correlated\nto the variable describing the settings. This problem is\nrelated to the possible restriction on ,,free will\" of the\nobservers which may lead to false violation of LHV, but\nstill nontrivial LHV bounds may be derived (see [10]).\nHere we shall derive the bounds in G-string type Bell inequality for programs P assumed to be correlated with\nsettings. For simplicity we shall consider the Bell-CHSH\nvariant, however the idea naturally extends to any Bell\ninequality for which the rate of the outcomes implying\nG = 1 to all outcomes maximized over all setting choices\nand hidden variables is bounded away from 1.\nAssuming that there is some correlation between hidden variable \u03bb and the settings we get for fixed \u03bb Bell\ninequality component:\n1\nX\n\nx,y=0\n\nP (x, y|\u03bb)P (a \u2295 b = xy|x, y) \u2264 B\n\n(10)\n\nwhere now B \u2208 [ 34 , 1] depending on correlations between\nsettings and \u03bb, but not on\nP the \u03bb itself is to be found. Note\nthat of course here still \u03bb P (x, y|\u03bb) = P (x, y) = 14 since\nthe source has no influence of observers choices. The best\nstrategies (LHV functions) for the source are those which\nmake the sum in LHS of (10) as large as possible. t is\nnot hard to see that the best source strategy to maximize\nLHS of (10) for given four component vector P (x, y|\u03bb) is\nthe one which multiplies by P (a \u2295 b = xy|x, y) = 0 the\nleast component of the vector. This immediately gives\nthe bound\nB = 1 \u2212 r, r = min {P (x, y|\u03bb)}\n(x,y);\u03bb\n\n(11)\n\nNow for given B or - equivalently - r let us estimate the\nmutual information I(\u03bb : XY ) = H(XY ) \u2212 H(XY |\u03bb)\nform below. Clearly H(XY ) = 2 while for fixed r\nH(XY |\u03bb) is maximized by the vector P (xy|\u03bb) with all\nthe components other than r equal to each other:\nH(XY |\u03bb) \u2264 \u2212r log r \u2212 (1 \u2212 r) log\n\n1\u2212r\n= f (r)\n3\n\nwhich gives I(\u03bb : XY ) \u2265 2 \u2212 f (r). It means that if\nthe local realistic bound is B = 1 \u2212 r then the source\nhas at least 2 \u2212 f (r) information about the settings. On\n\nthe other hand, since f is monotonously increasing, if\nthe source has I information about the settings then the\nlocal realistic bound is at most\nB \u2264 1 \u2212 f \u22121 (2 \u2212 I) \u2261 B(I)\n\n(12)\n\nPutting this bound into (10) and averaging it over \u03bb's\ngives the new inequality involving via information I the\ncorrelations between the hidden parameter and the settings:\n1\nX\n\nx,y=0\n\nP (x, y)P (a \u2295 b = xy|x, y) \u2264 B(I)\n\n(13)\n\nwith the critical amount of correlation information the\nsource can have (ie. the one reaching the quantum\n1\n) \u2248 0.046.\nbound) Icrit = 2 \u2212 f (1 \u2212 PQS ) = 2 \u2212 f ( 21 \u2212 2\u221a\n2\nNote that the parameter \u03bb that saturates the latter\nbound can be interpreted as an informational ,,content\"\n(or ,,capacity\") of correlations contained in the source\nthat correspond to quantum behavior. If applied to the\nquantum state \u03a8 it can be regarded as classical hidden\nsimulation of correlation properties of the state with respect to the considered Bell experiment. The role of\nthis parameter (or - more precisely - equivalence class\nof such parameters) and its possible optimization over\nset of more experiments will be considered elsewhere.\nFor the source with fixed I note that any program P\nproducing the string of length N \u2032 modifies the inequality\n(13) leading for large N \u2032 to:\nX\nCi Gi \u2264 B(I)N \u2032\n(14)\ni\u2208I\n\nNow consider the N length binary string d which is binary characteristic function of substring g' of g ie. it has\nzeros on the positions which were rejected by the program\nand ones on those positions which carry those elements of\ng that were chosen to form g'. Suppose that Kolmogorow\ncomplexity of d is M. It is clear that d cannot contain\nmore than M information about the settings. However\nthis is the only information that is ,,moved back\" to the\nsource in the proof of the Theorem 1. Since the settings\nform string of i.i.d., the information the d holds about\neach individual settings follows\nX\nIi \u2264 M\n(15)\ni\u2208I\n\nwhere Ii is the information d holds about the settings\nin i-th round of experiment. The use of the program\nP for the string from local realistic source is equivalent\nto another local realistic source which has this program\nbuilt in. But even though it does not meet the freedom of\nchoice requirement it still leads to local realistic bound:\nX\nX\nCi Gi \u2264\nB(Ii )\n(16)\ni\u2208I\n\ni\u2208I\n\n\f5\nFinally\nis a concave function one\nP note that sinceM B(I)\n\u2032\nhas i\u2208I B(Ii ) \u2264 B( N\n\u2032 )N . giving another inequality\nwhich is of our central interest:\n\u0010\nX\nM \u0011\nCi Gi \u2264 1 \u2212 f \u22121 (2 \u2212 \u2032 ) N \u2032\n(17)\nN\n\nthanks C. Mora and M. Piani for discussion. The work\nwas supported by UE SCALA project and by the LFPPI\nNetwork.\n\nIt is noteworthy that this gives a bound on CHSH regardless of the program P. So there are some procedures\nwhich lead to the bounds that even QM cannot violate.\nOur approach easily gives these bounds.\nConclusions .- We have provided natural method for\nextracting nonlocality properties form the sources that\nare non i.i.d.. If there exists some even long term memory in the source the nonlocality (or entanglement) can\nbe detected even if the standard tests fail. It is interesting\nthat, as we have shown, in the case of nonlocality it is possible to relax the condition about no prior source knowledge about observers settings. Possible trade off between that knowledge and the power to perform communication tasks like communication complexity reduction\nor cryptography is an interesting subject for further research. One can also consider programs with probabilistic algorithms built-in, especially in context of sources\nwith Marcovian memory. These interesting refinements\nof our scheme will be considered elsewhere. Note that\nthe present scheme is quite general and may be applied\nto multipartite sources and Bell inequalities. Its principles may be also used for entanglement detection and its\napplications like distillation and cryptography.\nAcknowledgements .- We thank A. Grudka, W.\nLaskowski and M.
