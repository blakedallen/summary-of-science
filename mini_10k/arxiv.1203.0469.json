We derive the amount of work\nthat can be extracted from such a device in the low temperature limit. Interestingly, we show this\nwork is determined by the information gain of the initial measurement rather than by the number\nand type of particles which constitute the working substance. Our work provides another clear\nconnection between information gain and extractable work in thermodynamical processes.\n\nThe laws of thermodynamics are well known for their\nrobustness, namely the fact that they survived both\nphysics revolutions of the 20th century. Neither quantum physics nor relativity have modified our confidence\nin the fact that the overall energy of a closed system\nshould be conserved, while its entropy tends to the maximum value with time. At low temperatures, however,\nquantum systems obey completely different statistics to\nclassical ones and one could imagine that bosonic and\nfermionic statistics, while not breaking the laws of thermodynamics, might still allow us to obtain more work\nfrom indistinguishable particles than from the same number of distinguishable ones. This has indeed recently been\nreported in [1].\nIn this Letter we show that the performance of a work\ncycle with indistinguishable particle depends on the information one has and is capable of obtaining about\nthem. The type of particles doing the work, be they\nclassical, quantum, distinguishable or indistinguishable,\nis only of secondary importance. Our work clarifies why\nthe basics of thermodynamics are independent of particle statistics, a fact that makes thermodynamical laws\nall the more remarkable. Furthermore, it emphasises that\nthe second law ought to most appropriately be phrased\nin terms of a trade-off between information gained and\nwork done.\nIn this letter we use the concept of the Szilard engine\n(SZE) [2, 3] - a hypothetical device which consists of a\ncylinder, serving as a heat reservoir at temperature T ,\ncontaining a single gas particle. The engine works by\ndividing the cylinder into two halves by an impenetrable barrier and measuring the position of the gas particle. Following the measurement, work can be extracted\nfrom this device by exploiting the pressure created by\nthe particle on the barrier. The amount of work is given\nas kT ln(2) with k being the Boltzmann constant. As\nwas identified by Bennett [4], the validity of the second\nthermodynamical law is saved by the fact that the information about the position of the particle before the\nwork has been done, or, equivalently, about the position\nof the barrier after the work has been done, has to be\nstored somewhere and erased by \"resetting\" the engine,\n\ni.e. removing the barrier and moving it to the middle\nagain.\nA natural extension of the original SZE is to include\nmore particles into the engine. In e.g. [4, 6, 7] it was\nshown that correlations have a positive impact on the\namount of work that can be extracted from the engine,\nquantum correlations having a particularly strong impact. A related important type of multi-particle effect is\nof course particle statistics associated with identical particles. In a recent paper Kim et. al. [1] performed a full\nquantum analysis of a SZE with more than one particle,\nbringing the role of particle statistics into focus.\nIn this Letter we clarify the role of particle statistics in\na quantum SZE by placing a particular emphasis on the\ninitial measurement. We consider the low temperature\nlimit as we are interested in quantum effects and these\nare most strongly manifested in this regime. We show\nthat the extractable work is directly connected with the\nmeasurement performed on the system. Crucially, for\na measurement with M outcomes, the work is bounded\nfrom above by W = kT ln(M ) and reaches this bound\nonly for measurements with equiprobable outcomes. In\nother words, we find that the extractable work is determined by the information gained during the initial\nmeasurement, regardless of whether the working medium\nconsists of distinguishable, bosonic or fermionic particles.\nBy performing a detailed analysis we show that the work\ncosts of the different steps do depend on the working\nmedium but conspire to remove this dependence when\ncombined.\nSzilard Engine.- Consider N particles (bosons,\nfermions or distinguishable particles) placed in a cylinder\nkept at a constant temperature T via the ongoing interaction between the particles and the walls of the cylinder.\nThis interaction is considered to be fast in the sense that\nthe time scale of thermalization is much smaller than any\nother time scale used. In the first part of the Letter we\nwill also assume the energy levels of the particles in the\ncylinder, as well as in its parts after inserting the barrier\n(piston), to be non-degenerate. However this does not\nexclude the energy levels on the respective side of the\npiston having the same energies.\n\n\f2\nThe original quantum SZE is used to extract work from\na temperature reservoir via the following steps:\n1. A piston (modelled by a sufficiently narrow and\nhigh potential barrier) is inserted into the cylinder to\nseparate it into two disconnected regions, preventing any\ntunneling within the relevant time-scales. The work cost\nof this step shall be called W 1.\n2. A measurement is performed to obtain the number\nof particles on one side of the cylinder. This measurement might be full, i.e. providing the exact number of\nparticles (or position in the case of distinguishable particles) or partial. The state of particles in the cylinder,\nafter the wall was inserted and before the measurement\nis performed, is a mixture of possible states obtained via\nthe measurement rather then their coherent superposition. This is due to the fact that interactions with the\nwalls of the cylinder will not only fix the temperature of\nthe gas during the process but also perform a measurement in the number basis in each part of the cylinder,\nonce the barrier is introduced into the cylinder.\n3. Depending on the result of the measurement the\npiston will be allowed to move quasi-statically to a position where the side-ways force acting on the piston will\nbe zero.\n4. The piston is then quasi-statically removed by decreasing the strength of the potential.\nIn the classical case there is no need to invest work into\nthe engine except during the erasure procedure - insertion\nof the piston, its removal as well as the measurement are\nconsidered to be \"for free\". The only stage of extraction\nof energy is the movement of the piston resulting from\nthe unequal pressure on either side. In contrast, in the\nthe quantum case one inevitably has to invest energy to\ncreate the barrier (step 1.); this can however be recovered\nduring the movement and removal of the barrier (steps\n3 and 4). In this picture the stages of movement and\nremoval of the barrier need not anymore be considered\nas independent actions. The extraction of work can be\nequally well done by exploiting the force towards the side\nof the barrier as well as acting on the top of the barrier.\nTherefore throughout the manuscript we will only work\nwith three phases of the engine - insertion, measurement\nand movement/removal phase. The combined work-cost\nof steps 3. and 4. shall be called W 2.\nThese four processes represent a closed cycle up to the\npoint where the result of the measurement in step 2 is still\nstored somewhere. For a full restoration of the original\nsetting one has to erase this information [4].\nLow temperature limit.-In the first part of this\nLetter we will consider the system to be non-degenerate\nand assume the low temperature limit. Here, the quantum effects of the engine are expected to manifest themselves in the strongest way - for high temperatures all\nparticles became essentially distinguishable as each can\nbe labelled by its energy. In what follows we shall denote the energy levels of the particles in the cylinder\n\nwithout the barrier as Ei . We consider the condition\nkT \u226a \u2206E, where \u2206E represents the difference between\nany two energy levels that could be potentially occupied\n- for bosons and distinguishable particles it is just the\ndifference between two lowest energy levels of the system and for fermions \u2206E represents the difference between the Fermi energy and the nearest higher energy\nlevel. Under these assumptions the partition function\nof any system consisting of N bosons or distinguishable\nparticles will be Zb = exp (\u2212N E1 /kT ) with E1 being\nthe lowest energy of the system. For fermions in a nondegenerate system\nthe partition\n\u0010 P\n\u0011 function will have the\nN\nform Zf = exp \u2212 i=1 Ei /kT .\nWe will now calculate the work that can be extracted\nfrom the closed cycle of the SZE. This can be defined as\nB\nW = kT ln Z\nZA with ZB being the partition function of\nthe final state and ZA being the partition function of the\ninitial state.\nInsertion of the barrier.-For bosons there are two\ndistinct possibilities for this step. Let us denote the enl(R)\nergy levels on the left(right) of the barrier as Ei . The\nfirst one corresponds to the case where we do not insert the barrier in the middle of the system E1l > E1r .\nQuantities for this case will be labeled by index n so the\nfinal partition function will be Zbn = exp (\u2212N E1r /kT ) ,\nwhich physically means that all particles condensed in\nthe lower potential well. This will result in a final\nwork W 1nb = N (E1 \u2212 E1r ) . Irrespective of the exact\nform of the potential defining the cylinder one can expect E1r > E1 , as the \"living space\" of the particles\nhas decreased and thus the work performed is negative.\nThe second possibility corresponds to the case when the\nbarrier is introduced in the middle of the system i.e.\nE1l = E1r . In this case quantities will be indexed by d and\nthe precision is expected to be such that E1l \u2212 E1r \u226a kT\nholds. Under such an assumption the partition sum\nwill be Zbd = (N + 1) exp (\u2212N E1r /kT ) and the work\nW 1db = kT ln(N + 1) + W 1nb .\nFor distinguishable particles the situation is quite similar to the above bosonic case. Again there is no limit on\nthe number of particles occupying the lowest energy level.\nThe only difference is for the degenerate case, where the\nparticles can choose their positions without change of the\ntotal energy of the system. Here the number of possible\nconfigurations will be 2N and the partition function will\nbe Zdd = 2N exp (\u2212N E1r /kT ). Here the extractable work\nW 1dd = N (kT ln 2 + E1 \u2212 E1r ), simply corresponding to\nthe case of joining N independent SZEs.\nFor fermions the situation is distinctly different. We\ndefine j as the level for which following equality holds:\nr\nl\nr\nEN\n\u2212j \u2264 Ej \u2264 EN \u2212j+1 .\n\n(1)\n\nFirst let us examine the case where there is sharp inequality on the right hand side\nThe final partition\nfunc\u0011\n\u0010 of\u0010(1).\nPj\nPN \u2212j r \u0011\nl\n/kT\ntion will be Zfn = exp \u2212\nE\n+\nE\ni\ni=1 i\ni=1\n\n\f3\nPN\nand the extractable work will be W 1nf =\ni=1 Ei \u2212\n\u0011\n\u0010P\nPN \u2212j r\nj\nl\ni=1 Ei . In contrast, for equality on\ni=1 Ei +\nthe right hand side of (1) we get a degeneracy\nin the energy levels of the whole system when the\nfermion at the Fermi level can freely choose either\nside of the \u0010cylinder\nbecomes\n\u0011\n\u0010P and thePpartition\u0011 function\nj\nN \u2212j\nl\nr\n/kT\nand\nthe exZfd = 2 exp \u2212\nE\n+\nE\ni\ni=1 i\ni=1\n\ntractable work will be W 1df = kT ln(2)+W 1nf . It is worth\nto mention that in contrast to the bosonic case there\nare potentially many (in the order of N ) possibilities for\nchoosing the position of the barrier to reach the equalized\nposition, but insertion into the middle of the container\nwill cost less work only for N odd.\nMeasurement.- In the second step a measurement\non the system is performed. This is only non-trivial\nif the energy levels of the final system (after inserting the barrier) are degenerate (with partition functions and works labelled by d) as in the other case it\nis just a single-outcome measurement confirming that all\nbosons/distinguishable particles are in the deeper well\n(larger part of the piston) or the fermions are distributed\nwithin the piston in a way expectable by the distribution\nof energy levels.\nIn the non-trivial bosonic case, the full measurement\nwill have N + 1 possible outcomes counting the number of particles on the left hand side. In the fermionic\ncase the measurement will be binary and for distinguishable particles the number of possible outcomes will be\n2N (specifying the position of every single particle).\nMovement and removal of piston.- In the classical case one would extract the work by simply moving the\npiston to its equilibrium position. All extractable work\nwould be extracted within this phase for an infinitely narrow piston. On the other hand, if the piston was removed\nfrom a different position than the equilibrium one, part\nof the potential work would just dissipate due to mixing\nof gases with different pressures. In the quantum case\nthe situation is much more subtle. Here the extraction of\nwork is not straightforward to define physically in connection with possible storages of energy such as excited\nstates of atoms. However, if we stick to the standard\ndefinition of the generalized force as F = \u2202E\n\u2202\u03bb with \u03bb being a parameter of the barrier (e.g. its position during\nthe movement phase or height during the removal phase)\nand accept that any such force can be utilized to perform\nwork, we can calculate the extractable work from the partition functions without making specific assumptions on\nthe process itself.\nFor both bosons and distinguishable particles the initial partition sum of the system is ZbA = exp (\u2212N E1r /kT )\nand final is Zb . Therefore we get as the extractable work\nr\nW 2b = N (E\nE1 ) . For fermions the\npartition\nsum is\n\u0011\n\u00101 \u2212\n\u0010P\nPN \u2212j r \u0011\nj\nl\nA\nand the fiZf = exp \u2212\ni=1 Ei /kT\ni=1 Ei +\nPj\nl\nnal one Zf ; the resulting work is W 2f =\ni=1 Ei +\n\nPN \u2212j\n\nPN\nEir \u2212 i=1 Ei .\nSumming up.-The total work gained (or paid) during the relevant parts of the cycle is then Wb = Wd =\nWf = 0 for non-degenerate cases with trivial measurements. The degenerate cases are much more interesting.\nIn the case of distinguishable particles Wd = N kT ln(2),\ncorresponding to N independent SZEs, for bosons we get\nWb = kT ln(N + 1) and for fermions Wf = kT ln(2).\nAll these results (even for non-degenerate cases) are connected by a unifying formula of the form\ni=1\n\nW = kT ln(M )\n\n(2)\n\nwith M being the number of possible measurement outcomes, each of them occurring with equal probability.\nThe work corresponds to the energy needed to erase a\nmemory able to store the result of the measurement.\nWe note that S. W. Kim et. al. [1] calculate the work\nyield during the removal of the barrier differently. They\nfirstly lower the barrier to the point where tunnelling\nis practically unrestricted. They view any energy that\ncould potentially be extracted here as lost. In the second phase where the barrier is removed and the \"living\nspace\" of the particles is enlarged they do however extract work. With this approach the net energy gained\nfrom the system in the low temperature limit is however\nalways negative if the number of particles N > 2. Work\ncould only be gained if all particles are found on one of\nthe sides of the cylinder, resulting in extractable work in\nthe order of kT with probability diminishing with large\nN . On the other hand, all other measurement results\nwould lead to a loss of energy in the order of \u2206E via\ntunnelling during the removal of the barrier phase.\nCoarse-grained measurements.- One may consider another way of exploiting particle statistics to try\nto violate the second law, by doing a coarse-grained measurement. Let us define a coarse-grained measurement\nwith M outcomes labelled by m (running from 1 to M ),\neach occurring with probability pm . As W 1 does not\ndepend on the measurement it will not change. The partition sum for bosons and distinguishable particles after the measurement with outcome m will have the form\nA\nZm\n= p1m exp (\u2212N E1r /kT ) . After the removal phase the\nB\npartition sum will be Zm\n= exp (\u2212N E1 /kT ) . The extractable work will thus be\nW = \u2212kT\n\nM\nX\n\npm ln (pm ) ,\n\n(3)\n\nm=1\n\nwhich holds also for fermions with M = 2 and p1 =\np2 = 1/2. From this we see that also in this case the\nextractable work does not depend on the actual number\nand type of particles in the system, but only on the measurement and its possible outcomes (taking into account\nthe fact that possible measurements are limited by the\nnumber and type of particles in the system). For a fixed\n\n\f4\nnumber of outcomes M the extractable work is maximized for a measurement with equal probability of each\noutcome and will gain Wmax = kT ln(M ).\nWe note that the result in Eq. (3) can we rewritten as\nW = T S with\nS = \u2212k\n\nM\nX\n\npm ln (pm ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nm=1\n\nbeing the entropy of the measurement outcomes. This\ndefinition exactly corresponds to the definition of Gibbs\nentropy except that here one deals with the probabilities\nof measurement outcomes rather than with the probabilities of microstates. One might view this correspondence\nin the following way: by removing entropy S from the\nsystem by a measurement one is able to extract exactly\nW = T S of work from the system before it turns back to\nits original state. The extracted entropy has to be stored\nsomewhere, or erased, costing exactly the same amount\nof work again [4]. (A net work yield can nevertheless be\nobtained if two reservoirs with different temperatures exist and the erasure is performed whilst in contact with\nthe colder one.)\nFor a measurement of distinguishable particles, where\none only measures the number of particles on each side,\nthe extractable work will be\nWd = \u2212kT\n\nN\nX\n\nm=0\n\n2\u2212N\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\nN\nN\n,\nln 2\u2212N\nm\nm\n\n(5)\n\nwhich is smaller than Wb for bosons, where the same\nmeasurement represents a full measurement of the system (reaching 21 Wb for the limit of large N [8]). This\ncan be explained by the smaller information value of the\nmeasurement outcome (with the same number of possible outcomes N + 1) for distinguishable particles in\ncomparison to bosons - whereas for bosons any result\nis equally probable, for distinguishable particles only the\nresults close to balanced are likely.\nDegeneracy.- Let us briefly discuss the possible degeneracies of energy levels in the system. For bosons and\ndistinguishable particles they only play a role for the lowest energy level. If the degeneracy can be revealed by the\nmeasurement, the system will correspond to an advanced\nSZE with more than one barrier and more complicated\nmeasurement. If the degeneracy cannot be revealed, influence will be exactly cancelled for the extractable work,\nhowever it would increase the work needed to insert the\nbarrier.\nFor fermions, if the Fermi energy level of the system is\ndegenerate, more than one fermion can occupy the same\nenergy. This can increase the number of particles actually performing work in the system up to N . In this\nscenario fermions behave exactly like bosons, condensing into the lowest energy level and performing the same\namount of work as bosons (if the degeneracies cannot be\n\nrevealed by measurement) or distinguishable particles (if\ndegeneracies can be revealed by the measurement).\nSummary and discussion.-We performed a detailed analysis of a Szilard engine in the low temperature\nlimit where the working medium is either distinguishable particles, bosons or fermions. We showed that the\nextractable work is determined by the information gain\nof the measurement performed on the system, regardless of the working medium. We demonstrated in detail\nhow things conspire to remove the dependence on the\nworking medium in that sense. This latter contribution\nis arguably of the same type as Bennett's exorcism of\nMaxwell's daemon [4] in that it shows in what exact way\nthe second law is not violated in this process.\nWe also showed that if a full measurement on the system is performed (which is associated with a different\namount of information gain in the different cases), distinguishable particles exhibit a much larger potential to\ndeliver work (scaling linearly with the number of particles) relative to bosons (where it scales logarithmically).\nFermions can only provide a fixed amount of work independent of the number of particles.\nMoreover we showed that for coarse-grained measurements the extractable work is again determined by the\ninformation gain of the measurement. This clarifies why\nthe same kind of measurement (measuring the number\nof particles on either side of the piston) extracts more\nenergy for bosons than for distinguishable particles.\nIt would be interesting to provide experimental evidence for the results obtained, especially for the possibility to extract work with balanced measurement outcomes. One could think about cold atoms kept at a stable\ntemperature by a (larger amount) of different atoms, as\nsuggested in [1]. Another option would be to use photons\nin micro-cavities as the working media. Here the confinement potential is easily controllable and the barrier could\nconsist just from an inserted mirror.\nAcknowledgements.-We acknowledge support\nfrom the National Research Foundation (Singapore) and\nthe Ministry of Education (Singapore).
