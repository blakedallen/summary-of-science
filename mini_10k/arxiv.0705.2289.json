In this context, the concept of semiclassicality is particularly relevant in order to make it\na physical theory. Applying the semiclassical theory, as the first order quantum corrections to the\nclassical theory, one hopes to get an insight into some of the structures of the full, elusive, theory.\nIn fact, the semiclassical approach provides the framework for some realistic scenarios which may\nexplain some of the features of the present universe [1]. It would even allow us to say something\non quantum gravity without having to build the full consistent theory. This is particularly interesting since experiments like GLAST, AUGER and others, should be able to measure effects due to a\nquantum gravity regime [2]. In the semiclassical theory of gravity a classical metric is coupled to the\nexpectation value of the stress tensor\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u22128\u03c0G < T\u03bc\u03bd > .\n\n(1)\n\nIt was found that this theory gives reliable results when the fluctuations in the stress tensor are not too\nlarge [3]. The semiclassical limit of the quantum gravity has to match the established classical theory\n\u2217\n\nemail: s-jalalzadeh@sbu.ac.ir\n\n1\n\n\ffor consistency. The form of the semiclassical corrections to the Einstein equation is known for many\nimportant cases in the 4D spacetime [4]. In this paper we will study the relation between the quantum\ncorrections to the Einstein equations and Induced Matter Theory (IMT) of Wesson. The physics of\ngravitational interactions in higher dimensional spacetime has received considerable interest in recent\nyears. The possibility that the fundamental Planck mass within a higher dimensional setting may\nbe as low as the electroweak scale [5, 6, 7] has stimulated extensive model building and numerous\ninvestigations aiming at signatures of extra dimensions. Central to these scenarios is that gravity\nlives in higher dimensions, while standard model particles are often confined to the four dimensional\nbrane. Higher dimensional extensions to general relativity were originally started with works of\nKaluza and Klein (KK) with the addition of one extra dimension and subsequently generalized to\nmore extra dimensions by various authors. In KK theory, the components of the 5D metric tensor\nis independent of the extra dimension. In contrast to this model, Wesson suggested the IMT [8]\nwhich differs from KK theory by the fact that it has a noncompact fifth dimension and that the\n5D bulk space is devoid of matter. In this theory the effective 4D matter is a consequence of the\ngeometry of the 5D bulk space which is Ricci-flat while the 4D hypersurface is curved by the 4D\ninduced matter[9]. One of the interesting futures of IMT is that it contains some quantum mechanical\neffects. For example it has been shown that particles and waves are merely different representations\nof the same underlying geometry and may be the same thing viewed in different ways [10]. Also,\nusing 5D IMT, a form of Heisenberg's relation that applies to real and virtual particles has been\nderived by Wesson [11]. We will show that the geometrical fluctuations obtained via IMT may be\nrelated to the quantum mechanical effects. In this paper we focus attention on IMT and proceed to\nderive the semiclassical corrections to the Einstein equation using this theory. In doing so, we will\nbriefly review the geometrical definitions and derive the induced Einstein equation on the perturbed\nbrane through contracting the Gauss-Codazzi equations. In section three, we will consider a FRW\nuniverse as a non-perturbed brane embedded in a 5D flat spacetime and study the Einstein equation\non the perturbed brane. We will show that these equations correspond to the semiclassical Einstein\nequation. It means that the classical fluctuations of the perturbed brane can be interpreted as the\nquantum fluctuations of the matter field.\n\n2\n\nGeometrical setup\n\nConsider the background manifold V 4 isometrically embedded in V5 by a map Y : V 4 \u2192 V5 such that\nGAB Y A,\u03bc Y B,\u03bd = \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\nGAB Y A,\u03bc N B = 0,\n\nGAB N A N B = 1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere GAB (\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd ) is the metric of the bulk (brane) space V5 (V 4 ) in an arbitrary coordinate, {Y A }\n({x\u03bc }) are the bases of the bulk (brane) and N A is a normal unit vector orthogonal to the brane.\nPerturbation of V 4 in a sufficiently small neighborhood of the brane along an arbitrary transverse\ndirection \u03be is given by\nZ A (x\u03bc , \u03b6) = Y A + (L\u03be Y)A ,\n(3)\nwhere L represents the Lie derivative and \u03b6 is a small parameter along N A parameterizing the extra\nnoncompact dimension. By choosing \u03be orthogonal to the brane we ensure gauge independency [12]\nand have perturbations of the embedding along a single orthogonal extra direction N\u0304 , giving the local\ncoordinates of the perturbed brane as\nA \u03bd\nA\nZ,\u03bc\n(x , \u03b6) = Y,\u03bc\n+ \u03b6 N\u0304 A,\u03bc (x\u03bd ),\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fIn a similar manner, one can find that since the vectors N\u0304 A depend only on the local coordinates x\u03bc ,\nthey do not propagate along extra dimension\nN A (x\u03bc ) = N\u0304 A + \u03b6[N\u0304 , N\u0304 ]A = N\u0304 A .\n\n(5)\n\nThe above assumptions lead to the embedding equations of the perturbed geometry\nG\u03bc\u03bd = GAB Z A,\u03bc Z B,\u03bd ,\n\nG\u03bc4 = GAB Z A,\u03bc N B ,\n\nGAB N A N B = G44 .\n\n(6)\n\nIf we set N A = \u03b44A , the metric of the bulk space can be written in the following matrix form (Gaussian\nframe)\n!\ng\u03bc\u03bd 0\nGAB =\n,\n(7)\n0 1\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd is the metric of the perturbed brane\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2\u03b6 K\u0304\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b6 2 \u1e21\u03b1\u03b2 K\u0304\u03bc\u03b1 K\u0304\u03bd\u03b2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nK\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212GAB Y A,\u03bc N B;\u03bd ,\n\n(9)\n\nand\nrepresents the extrinsic curvature of the original brane (second fundamental form). Any fixed \u03b6\nsignifies a new perturbed geometry, enabling us to define an extrinsic curvature similar to the original\none by\nK\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212GAB Z A,\u03bc N B;\u03bd = K\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b6 K\u0304\u03bc\u03b3 K\u0304 \u03b3 \u03bd .\n(10)\nEquations (8) and (10) are important in obtaining the Einstein equation on the perturbed brane\nin our approach and show the relation of original and perturbed branes. In the Induced Matter\napproach, the Einstein equation in the bulk is written in the form\nRAB = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere RAB is the Ricci tensor of the 5D bulk space. To obtain the effective field equations in 4D,\nlet us start by contracting the Gauss-Codazzi equations [13] 1\nA B C D\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 = 2\u01ebK\u03b3[\u03b1 K\u03b2]\u03b4 + RABCD Z,\u03b1\nZ,\u03b2 Z,\u03b3 Z,\u03b4\n\n(12)\n\nA B C D\n2K\u03bc[\u03bd;\u03c1] = RABCD Z,\u03bc\nN Z,\u03bd Z,\u03c1 .\n\n(13)\n\nand\nwhere RABCD and R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 are the Riemann curvature of the bulk and perturbed brane respectively.\nNow by contracting Gauss equations (12), decomposing Riemann tensor of the bulk space into the\nWeyl and Ricci tensors and Ricci scalar and using equation (11), the Einstein equation induced on\nthe perturbed brane becomes\nG\u03bc\u03bd = Q\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bc\u03bd ,\n(14)\nA N B N C Z D is the electric part of the Weyl tensor C\nwhere E\u03bc\u03bd = CABCD Z,\u03bc\nABCD of bulk space. One\n,\u03bd\ncan directly show that Q\u03bc\u03bd is independently a conserved quantity, that is Q\u03bc\u03bd;\u03bc = 0. All of the above\nquantities in equation (14) are obtained on the perturbed brane, since in the spirit of IMT the matter\nfield cannot exactly be confined to the original non perturbed brane. Hence from a 4D point of view,\nthe empty 5D equations look like the Einstein equation with induced matter. The electric part of\n1\n\nEisenhart's convention [13] has been used in defining the Riemann tensor.\n\n3\n\n\fthe Weyl tensor is well known from the brane point of view. It describes a traceless matter, denoted\nby dark radiation or Weyl matter. Since Q\u03bc\u03bd is a conserved quantity, according to the spirit of IMT\n[8], it should be related to the ordinary matter as partly having a geometrical origin\nQ\u03bc\u03bd = \u22128\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(15)\n\nAccording to Wesson's results, the IMT can contain quantum effects [9, 10]. Now, the question\narises as to whether the classical fluctuations of the brane can relate to the quantum fluctuations of\nthe matter field. In other words, can induced field equation (14) describe the semiclassical Einstein\nequation? In the following we focus on deriving the semiclassical corrections to the Einstein equation\nthrough the IMT.\nOne knows that quantum corrections to general relativity are expected to be important in regimes\nwhere the curvature is near the Planck scale (lpl = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221233 cm). In a regime where the curvature\napproaches but always remains less than the Planck length, a semiclassical approximation to the full\ntheory of quantum gravity should be sufficient. It may seem that if the brane perturbations are of\nthe order of the Planck length, equation (14) may relate to the semiclassical description of quantum\ngravity. As we know the effective size of the extra dimension which should be smaller than 0.2 mm\ncan be obtained from\nMp2\nL = 3,\nM\u2217\nprovided M\u2217 > 2 \u00d7 108 GeV [14]. Here Mp and M\u2217 are the Planck mass and the fundamental scale of\nthe energy in the bulk space respectively. On the other hand, the standard model fields are usually\nconfined to the brane within some localization width i.e, the brane width [15, 16]. Similarly, in\nInduced Matter theory, if the induced matter satisfies the restricted energy condition, the particles\nwill be stabilized around the original brane [17]. The size of the fluctuations of the induced matter\ncorresponds with the width of the brane. Since within the ordinary scales of energy we do not see the\ndisappearance of particles, one may assume the fluctuations of the matter field exist only around the\noriginal brane. In other words, if the brane width is d, it means that brane localized particles probe\nthis length scale across the brane and therefor the observer cannot measure the distance on the brane\nto a better accuracy than d. In braneworld models with large extra dimensions, usually the width\nof the brane should be in order of or less than T eV \u22121 . On the other hand, the observational data\nconstrains the brane width to be in order of planck length, see [18] and references therein. Hence, in\nthis paper according to [19] we assume that the size of the fluctuations of the brane (the width of the\nbrane) is in order of Planck length which is much smaller than the effective size of the extra dimension\nL. This assumption may help us to investigate the correct quantum phenomenology in IMT. In the\nfollowing section we proceed to study the Einstein equation on the perturbed bran applying a simple\ngravitational model and derive the semiclassical corrections to the Einstein equation.\n\n3\n\nFRW model with quantum corrections\n\nConsider a FRW universe embedded (as a non perturbed brane) in an 5D flat bulk space so that the\nextra dimension is spacelike. The FRW line element is written as\n#\n\n\"\n\ndr 2\n+ r 2 (d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\nds = \u2212dt + a (t)\n1 \u2212 kr 2\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere k takes the values \u00b11 or 0 and a(t) is the scale factor. Now, we proceed to analyze the Einstein\nequation (14) on the perturbed brane. To do this, we first compute the extrinsic curvature through\n4\n\n\fsolving the Codazzi equations (13) [20]\n1 d b\n,\nK\u030400 = \u2212\n\u0227 dt a\nb\nK\u0304\u03b1\u03b2 = 2 g\u03b1\u03b2 ,\na\n\u0012 \u0013\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 6= 0.\n\n(17)\n\nHere, b is an arbitrary function of t.

Since the solution of (30) is a correction to solution\nof (24) in power of curvature we expect that at late times, when the solution on the original brane\nis nearly flat, these corrections will be flat. At early times, when the curvature is below the Planck\nscale, we expect the corrections to be significant and at very early times, when the original brane\ncurvature is near or above the planck scale, we expect that this approach will break down because\nneglected higher order corrections would dominate.\nAccording to Wesson [19], we assume that the region of the brane fluctuations is in order of Planck\nlength (c = 1, G = 1)\n2\n\u03b6 2 \u223c lpl\n\u223c h\u0304.\n(31)\nNow we can redefine (30) using (23) and (31)\n\u03ba\u03c10 a40 h\u0304 8\u03ba\u039b\u03c10 a40\n\u02272 3k\n+\n\u2212\n\u039b\n\u2212\n+\na2\na2\na4\n3\na4\n\"\n#2\n\"\n#\n\u039b2 2\u03ba\u039b\u03c10 a40 \u03ba2 \u03c120 a80\n\u03ba\u039b\u03c10 a40\n16\n= 0,\n\u22124h\u0304\n+\n+\n\u2212 h\u0304\n3\n3a4\n3a8\n3\n(a4 \u039b + \u03ba\u03c10 a40 )\n3\n\n(32)\n\nwhere \u03ba = 8\u03c0. One may compare equation (32) with the same result which is obtained through the\nsemiclassical approach to Einstein equations in [21].

In a FRW background metric, the (0, 0) component of the Einstein equations with first-order semiclassical quantum\ncorrections is obtained in the form [21]\n(3)\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n\u039b2 2\u03ba\u039b\u03c10 a40 \u03ba2 \u03c120 a80\n\u03ba\u03c10 a40\n8\u03ba\u039b\u03c10 a40\n\u02272 3k\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b1\nh\u0304\n+\n\u03b1\nh\u0304\n+\n= 0.\n3 2 + 2 \u2212\u039b\u2212\n1\n3\na\na\na4\na4\n3\n3a4\n3a8\n\n(36)\n\nComparing (32) and (36) indicates that if we choose the parameter \u03b11 = \u2212 31 and \u03b13 = \u22124 for the\nradiation matter, the result of the both methods are the same up to the last term in (32). This\nterm cannot be obtained using the self-consistent method. This comparison may imply that one can\ninterpret (32) as the Einstein equation with the first order quantum corrections.\nIn 4D, for conformally flat classical background, when the quantum state is constructed from\nthe conformal vacuum (conformally trivial case), the semiclassical corrections to Einstein equation\nare completely determined by local geometry and there is no additional non-local contribution to\nthe stress tensor [4]. Computing the semiclassical Einstein equation with quantum corrections in\na general case is difficult because it includes the state dependent part of the expectation value of\nquantum matter fields. As was indicated we can derive the local corrections to the Einstein equations\nvia IMT with a 5D flat bulk space (E\u03bc\u03bd = 0). Studying a general case in Induced Matter approach\nmay be possible via computing the Weyl tensor E\u03bc\u03bd , that carriers non-local effects onto the brane\n[22]. Hence, one can say the non-local quantum contributions to the stress tensor from the point\nof view of IMT may be related to the non-local effects of bulk space. One simple case is when we\nattempt to obtain the quantum effects in black holes. In this case the quantum effects diverge near\nthe singularity. This allows for the possibility that black holes without singularities might occur in\nnature [22]. On the other hand, it is possible to obtain non-singular black hole solutions in the brane\nworld model by solving the effective field equations for the induced metric on the brane [23]. Hence\nobtaining the quantum corrections via IMT in the case of non vanishing E\u03bc\u03bd is an interesting subject\nworth studying.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have considered a FRW universe embedded in a 5D flat bulk space with a space like extra\ndimension. We have shown that the corrections to Einstein equation through the fluctuations of brane\ncan correspond to the semiclassical quantum corrections to the Einstein equation for the conformally\ntrivial case. Although this correspondence was obtained in a conformally flat background, it may be\ngeneralized to a general case by considering the non-local effects of E\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nacknowledgements\nThe authors thank prof.
