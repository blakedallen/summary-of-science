The \"classic\" Uncertainty Principle is explored as a special case of a more general\noperator framework. The time-bandwidth concentration problem\nis shown as a similar special case. A spatial concentration of radio\nsignals example is provided, and it is shown that an Uncertainty\nPrinciple exists for concentration of single-frequency signals for\nregions in space. We show that the uncertainty is related to the\nvolumes of the spatial regions.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nSignal processing, at its most fundamental level, concerns\nthe extraction of information (signal) from a system under\nvarious constraints. Typically, communication engineers consider the signal as being embedded in noise, and although the\nsignal may have spatial, temporal or bandwidth constraints,\nthey are usually concerned with noise as the limiting factor.\nIn the following work, we will consider a fundamental limit to\nsignal extraction without impediments due to noise. We shall\npose the following question:\nGiven a signal (wavefield) which has energy in one volume\nVA , how well can we constraint that signal to have energy in\nanother volume VB ?\nThis question motivates examination of Uncertainty Principles (UP's). We may regard uncertainty as a basic limit on\nsignal information extraction, without requiring a model for\nnoise \u2013 since any noise can only further hinder our efforts.\nUncertainty Principles have gained great popularity since\nHeisenberg. The famous example is Heisenberg's Uncertainty\nPrinciple: it is impossible to exactly measure the location and\nmomentum of a particle simultaneously. This is a special case\nof a more general framework, which may be applied (via\nvarious Hilbert space techniques) to a range of scenarios.\nIn a communication theory setting, a similar UP has been\nwell known: that a signal cannot be arbitrarily confined in\nboth time and frequency. The reader is directed to [1] for\na discussion. The work of [2\u20134] has formalised this result,\nalthough without explicit reference to the operator theoretic\nnature of the problem1. The time-bandwidth concept of a\ntemporal signal provides us with a great deal of intuition and\nwe shall draw heavily on the classic works.\nThere is a significant distinction between essential dimensionality results such as [1, 6] and uncertainty results [7, 8].\nDimensionality results (eg. 2W T ) may be seen as a counting\nof the number of degrees of freedom a signal (or function) has\nwithin a particular set of constraints \u2013 much like the rank of a\n1 Landau\n\nprovides some work in this regard [5].\n\nmatrix. Uncertainty tells us to what extent a signal will achieve\nall constraints, and how uniquely that solution is specified by\nthe constraints.\nThe remainder of this paper is arranged as follows: In\nSection II we collate classic results in uncertainty and formulate UP's in terms of Operator Theoretic forms. Section III\ndevelops an Uncertainty Principle for communication between\nvolumes with a particular form of operator channel. We\nprovide a free-space example. Conclusions are drawn, and\nproofs are consigned to the appendix.\nII. U NCERTAINTY P RINCIPLES :\n\nA REVIEW\n\nBefore explaining the Uncertainty Principle, we develop\nsome relevant notation.\nA. Notation\nFollowing Selig [7], let H be a Hilbert space with inner\nproduct h*, *i and norm k * k \u2261 h*, *i1/2 . Further, let A be\na linear operator with domain D(A) \u2286 H and range in H.\nWe then define the normalised expectation value, \u03c4A (f ) and\nstandard deviation (uncertainty), \u03c3A (f ) of the operator A with\nrespect to f \u2208 D(A) to be [7]\nhAf, f i\nhf, f i\n\u03c3A (f ) \u2261 k(A \u2212 \u03c4A (f ))f k.\n\u03c4A (f ) \u2261\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nThe adjoint of operator A, A\u2020 is defined using the following\nequation [9]\nhAx, yi = hx, A\u2020 yi \u2200x \u2208 D(A), y \u2208 D(A\u2020 ).\n\n(3)\n\nFurthermore, A is said to be Hermitian or self-adjoint if A =\nA\u2020 . For a self-adjoint operator\nhAx, yi = hx, Ayi \u2200x, y \u2208 D(A).\n\n(4)\n\nAny operator that obeys equation 4 is said to be symmetric.\nGiven two linear operators A and B with domains D(A)\nand D(B) respectively, the commutator is defined as\n[A, B] \u2261 AB \u2212 BA\n\n(5)\n\nand the anti-commutator is defined as\n[A, B]+ \u2261 AB + BA\n\n(6)\n\nwith domains D(AB) \u2229 D(BA) for either one. Operators A\nand B are said to commute with each other if [A, B] = 0.\nOtherwise they are called non-commutative operators.\n\n\fAlso, let L2 [R] be the set of all square integrable functions\ndefined on the real line with norm kf k2 = hf, f i1/2 . Here the\ninner product h*, *i is defined as\nZ \u221e\n(7)\nhf, gi =\nf (t)g(t)dt.\n\nwhenever these integrals exist. Then\n\nConsider kf k22 as the energy of the function f \u2208 L2 [R]. The\nangle between two non-zero functions f and g is defined as\n\nfor any r > 0.\nTheorem 2 gives valuable insight into how localized a\nfunction can be in both time and frequency. If one defines\n\u2206x and \u2206\u03c9 to be the measure of approximate time duration\nand bandwidth of the signal respectively, then Theorem 2 says\nthat the product of time duration and bandwidth of a function\nis bounded from below by \u03c0/2: if the time-spread gets very\nsmall, the frequency-spread must be large and vice-versa.\nThough a good qualitative tool, this is inadequate for the\npurposes of signal processing. Theorem 2 does not answer\nthe question: given a bandlimited function (i.e. f\u02c6(\u03c9) = 0 for\n\u03c9\u2208\n/ [\u2212\u03a9, \u03a9]) how much of the energy of f is 'concentrated'\nin finite duration of time. This would be useful in answering\nthe question: \"given a bandlimited channel, how much of the\ntransmitted signal can a receiver measure over a finite period\nof time?\"\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nR{hf, gi}\n.\nkf k2 kgk2\n\n(8)\n\nf (x)e\u2212i\u03c9x dx\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b8(f, g) = cos\u22121\nWe also define\nf\u02c6(\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nto be the Fourier transform of f (x) whenever this integral\nexists.\nB. Classic Uncertainty Principle\nThe classical uncertainty principle states that the values of\ntwo non-commuting observers such as position and momentum\ncannot be precisely determined in any quantum state. That is,\nthe standard deviation of two non-commuting operators cannot be made arbitrarily small simultaneously. The following\ntheorem is a general statement of this phenomenon.\nTheorem 1 (theorem 3.4,[7]): If A and B are two symmetric operators on a Hilbert space H, then\n1n\n2\nk(A \u2212 a)f k k(B \u2212 b)f k \u2265\n|h[A, B]f, f i|\n2\no1/2\n2\n+ |h[A \u2212 aI, B \u2212 bI]+ f, f i|\n(10)\n\nfor all f \u2208 D(AB) \u2229 D(BA) and all a, b \u2208 R. Equality holds\nprecisely when (A \u2212 a)f and (B \u2212 b)f are scalar multiples of\none another.\nA special case of this theorem bounds the standard deviation\nof two non-commuting operators as explained in the following\ncorollary which we get by substituting a = \u03c3A (f ) and b =\n\u03c3B (f ) in theorem 1.\nCorollary 1.1: If A and B are two symmetric operators on\na Hilbert space H, then\n1p\n\u03c3A (f )\u03c3B (f ) \u2265\n|h[A, B]f, f i|2\n(11)\n2\nfor all f \u2208 D(AB) \u2229 D(BA) and all a, b \u2208 R. Equality holds\nprecisely when (A \u2212 \u03c4A (f ))f and (B \u2212 \u03c4B (f ))f are scalar\nmultiples of one another.\nA special case of this corollary is the following Heisenberg\nUncertainty Principle which states that a function and its\nFourier transform cannot be arbitrarily localised.\nTheorem 2 (theorem 6.1, [7]): Let f \u2208 L2 (R), kf k = 1\nand set\nZ\nZ\n2\nxo = x|f (x)| dx\n\u03c9o = \u03c9|f\u02c6(\u03c9)|2 d\u03c9\nZ\nZ\n\u2206x = (x \u2212 xo )2 |f (x)|2 dx\n\u2206\u03c9 = (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9o )2 |f\u02c6(\u03c9)|2 d\u03c9\n\n\u2206x\u2206\u03c9 \u2265 \u03c0/2,\nwhere equality is attained iff\nf (x) = (r/\u03c0)1/4 ei\u03c9o x e\u2212r(x\u2212xo )\n\n2\n\n/2\n\nC. Uncertainty principle for energy concentrations\nLandau and Pollak [3] proposed that for the purposes of\nsignal processing, a more relevant uncertainty principle should\nuse sharper measures of concentrations in time and frequency\nthan the ones used in Heisenberg's principle [3]. To help\nderive their uncertainty principle [3] define D = {f : f \u2208\nL2 [R], f (t) = 0 \u2200|t| > T /2} to be the class of all time-limited\nfunctions and B = {f : f \u2208 L2 [R], f\u02c6(\u03c9) = 0 \u2200|\u03c9| > \u03a9} to\nbe the class of all band limited functions. Here, f\u02c6(\u03c9) is the\nFourier transform of f (t) as defined in equation 9. Also T ,\nthe time duration and W = \u03a9/2\u03c0, the bandwidth are fixed for\nthe remainder of this paper. It is easy to prove [2] that D and\nB are complete subspaces of L2 [R].\nDefine the projection operators\nB : L2 [R] \u2192 B and D : L2 [R] \u2192 D as follows\n\u001a\nf (t), |t| \u2264 T /2\nDf (t) =\n(12)\n0,\n|t| > T /2\nZ \u03a9\n1\nf\u02c6(\u03c9)ej\u03c9t d\u03c9\n(13)\nBf (t) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03a9\nUsing these operators we can calculate the fraction of\nenergy, \u03b12 of any function f \u2208 L2 [R] in the finite duration of\ntime [\u2212T /2, T /2].\n\u03b12 =\n\nkDf k22\n.\nkf k22\n\n(14)\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate, \u03b2 2 , the fraction of energy of a\nfunction in a finite bandwidth [\u2212\u03a9, \u03a9].\n\u03b22 =\n\nkBf k22\n.\nkf k22\n\n(15)\n\n[3] show that \u03b1 and \u03b2 cannot be arbitrarily large. Specifically,\nthey prove\n\n\fwaves within the receiving volume we will need to consider\nrestrictions of f and f\u02c6 to VT and VR respectively. Let \u03c7V be\nthe characteristic (truncation) operator:\n(\nf (r) r \u2208 V,\n\u03c7V f (r) =\n(17)\n0\notherwise.\n\nB\nD\n\n\u03b8\n\nWe say that a function f is \u01eb-concentrated in volume V in\nsome norm k * k if\nFig. 1. Subspaces B and D, with minimum angle \u03b8. Point of intersection is\n0 vector. Here, B, D \u2282 R3 , below, B, D \u2282 H with dimension \u05d00 .\n\nTheorem 3 (theorem 2, [3]): Let 0 \u2264 \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2264 1. Then there\nexists a function f \u2208 L2 [R], kf k2 = 1 with kDf k2 = \u03b1 and\nkBf k2 = \u03b2 if and only if (\u03b1, \u03b2) 6= (0, 1) or (1, 0) and\np\ncos\u22121 \u03b1 + cos\u22121 \u03b2 \u2265 cos\u22121 \u03bb0\nwhere, \u03bb0 is the largest eigenvalue of the equation\n\n\u03bb\u03c8 = BD\u03c8\nThis theorem constrains the possible values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 because\n\u03bb0 < 1 [2]. So any function cannot have arbitrarily large\nfractions of energy in both a finite-time duration and a finitefrequency bandwidth. We will show in the next section that\nthis theorem is a special case of a more general theorem just\nlike the Heisenberg Principle is a special case of the classical\nuncertainty principle as alluded to by [3]. We show that this\nmore general theory can be used to understand communication\nthrough arbitrary channels.\nIII. C OMMUNICATION\n\nBETWEEN FINITE VOLUMES AND\nTHE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE\n\nThe derivations above are for a function defined on the\nreal line and its Fourier transform, however the principle can\nbe extended to arbitrary transforms defined on Rn . The key\nproperty is that the subspaces B and D form nonzero minimum\nangles. Before deriving these results, we explain the physical\nmodel.\n\nk\u03c7V f k2\n\u2265 1 \u2212 \u01eb2 .\nkf k2\nWith this notation in place we can now look at the set\nof functions D that a receiver can measure and the set of\nfunctions B a transmitter can generate:\nD = {f : f = \u03c7VR g, g \u2208 L2 [R3 ]}\n2\n\n3\n\nB = {f : f = \u0393\u03c7VT g, g \u2208 L [R ]}.\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nIf the spaces D and B are complete, we can define projection\noperators D : L2 [R3 ] \u2192 D = \u03c7VR and B : L2 [R3 ] \u2192 B. Note\nthat B 6= \u0393\u03c7VT . We can also define an angle between these\ntwo subspaces as follows:\n\u03b8(B, D) =\n\ninf\n\n\u03b8(f, g).\n\n(20)\n\nf \u2208B,g\u2208D\nf 6=0,g6=0\n\nB. Uncertainty Principle for arbitrary subspaces\nWe can again think of kf k22 as the energy of a function.\nThen \u03b12 = kDf k22 /kf k22 is the fraction of energy of f in\nthe space of receiver functions and \u03b2 2 = kBf k22 /kf k22 is the\nfraction of the energy of f in the space of transmitter functions.\nWe can now prove the uncertainty principle that constrains the\npossible range of values that \u03b1 and \u03b2 can take provided the\nsubspaces B and D form a non-zero minimum angle.\nTheorem 4: Let subspaces B and D form a non-zero minimum angle \u03b80 then\n\nConsider communication using scalar waves between two\nvolumes VT , VR \u2282 R3 , where R3 is the standard three\ndimensional Euclidian space. Let L2 (V ) be the space of all\nsquare integrable functions defined on volume V \u2282 R3 with\nthe standard inner product. Following [10], assume there are\nsources2 f \u2208 L2 (R3 ) that generate waves f\u02c6 \u2208 L2 (R3 )\ngoverned by some transformation \u0393 : L2 (R3 ) \u2192 L2 (R3 ):\n\ncos\u22121 \u03b1 + cos\u22121 \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b80 .\n(21)\nThis theorem has a very simple physical interpretation. If\nthe space of all the functions that a transmitter can generate\nand the space of all the functions a receiver can receive form a\nnon-zero minimum angle then there exist no functions that can\nhave arbitrarily large fractions of energy in these two spaces of\nfunctions. We can calculate this minimum angle by calculating\nthe norm of the operator kBDk2 and this is the subject of our\nnext theorem.\nTheorem 5: The angle between two complete subspaces B\nand D with projection operators B and D is\n\nf\u02c6 = \u0393f.\n\n\u03b8(B, D) = cos\u22121 kBDk2\n\nA. Physical Problem and Notation\n\n2\n\n(16)\n\n3\n\nHere, L [R ] is the set of all square integrable functions\ndefined on R3 with the standard inner product. If we only\nhave sources in the transmitting volume and can only measure\n2 This is the time independent wave function. The complete time-dependant\nwave function, for exponential time dependence may be written as F (r, t) =\nf (r) exp{i\u03c9t}. However the theory can easily be extended by defining\nvolumes V \u2282 R4 where the fourth coordinate is time.\n\n(22)\n\nC. General Uncertainty principle\nWe prove a slightly modified version of the general uncertainty theorem proved in [11]. In the following L1 [V ], L2 [V ]\n3\nand L\u221e [V ] are spaces\nR of functions definedRon V 2\u2282 R with\nfinite L1 (k * k1 = V | * |), L2 (k * k2 = V | * | ) and L\u221e\n(k * k\u221e = supV | * |) norms.\n\n\fTheorem 6 (Generalized\nSuppose\n\u0393(f ) = f\u02c6\nT 2 3 Uncertainty):\nT \u221e\n1 3\n2 3\n\u02c6\nand f \u2208 L [R ]\nL [R and f \u2208 L [R ]\nL [R3 ] and\nsatisfies\n1) kf k2 = \u03b1kf\u02c6k2\n2) kf\u02c6k\u221e \u2264 \u03b2kf k1 .\nAlso, suppose f is \u01ebT -concentrated to VT in the L1 norm and\nf\u02c6 is \u01ebR -concentrated to VR in the L2 norm. Then,\n|VT ||VR |\u03b12 \u03b2 2 \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01ebT )2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb2R )\nThe theorem has a very simple physical interpretation for\ncommunication between finite volumes. Firstly, by requiring\nkf k2 = \u03b1kf\u02c6k2 , we ensure that the energy of the received\nsignal is proportional to that of the transmitting signal. So \u03b1\ndetermines the attenuation in the signal and we expect it to be\ngreater than 1. Secondly, kf\u02c6k\u221e \u2264 \u03b2kf k1 can be thought of as\na stability condition (i.e. bounded input gives bounded output).\nAs a direct corollary to Theorem 6 we obtain an uncertainty\nprinciple for communicating volumes\nCorollary 6.1 (Volumetric Communication Uncertainty):\nLet the transmitting volume VT be finite, and the conditions\nfor Theorem 6 hold. Then\n|VT ||VR |\u03b12 \u03b2 2 \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb2R )\nSince f must be perfectly concentrated in VT and so \u01ebT = 0.\nie. the maximum fraction of energy that can be inside the\nreceiving volume is bounded from above.\nIV. C ONCLUSIONS\nWe investigated Uncertainty Principles for the transmission\nof waves between volumes, using a generalised version of\nthe classic Heisenberg UP.
