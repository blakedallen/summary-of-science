Introduction\nRadio relics are diffuse radio sources that are\nusually located in cluster outskirts and that\nare characterized by steep radio spectra1 with\n\u03b1 \u2265 1.2. The origin of the relativistic electrons\n- that produce the synchrotron radiation in the\nradio band - in these very extended sources is\nstill not entirely clear. In the past two years,\nthere has been quite a bit of new data on radio relics with the discovery of the relic in the\ngalaxy cluster CIZA J2242.8+5301 being the\nmost prominent. CIZA J2242.8+5301 is a disturbed galaxy cluster located at z = 0.1921\n(Kocevski et al. 2007). The cluster hosts a\nlarge double radio relic system, as well as\nSend offprint requests to: M.Br\u00fcggen\n1\nThe spectrum is defined as S (\u03bd) \u221d \u03bd\u2212\u03b1 .\n\nadditional large-scale diffuse radio emission\n(van Weeren et al. 2010).This recent data has\ngiven support to models that explain relics\nthrough diffusive particle acceleration at shock\nfronts, e.g. (Ensslin et al. 1998; Miniati et al.\n2001). The spectral index (\u03b1) across the bright\nnorthern relic steepens systemically in the direction of the cluster center, across the full\nlength of the narrow relic. This is expected\nfor outwards moving shock waves, with synchrotron and inverse Compton losses behind\nthe shock front. However, there are still quite a\nfew puzzles that surround radio relics, of which\nI will list the most intriguing:\n\u2013 Which processes accelerate electrons so efficiently at relatively low Mach number\n(M \u223c 2 \u2212 4) shocks?\n\n\fBr\u00fcggen: Cluster Outskirts\n\n\u2013 What produces the magnetic fields inside\nrelics? Both the inferred field strengths as\nwell as the observed polarisation of the radio emission need to be explained.\n\u2013 Why do some relics have very sharp edges\nwhile others appear very fuzzy?\n\u2013 Under which conditions do relics form?\nWhen do we see single and when double\nrelics?\n\u2013 Some relics appear to be connected to\ncluster-wide radio halo emission. Is there\na physical connection between the two?\nMany of these questions touch physical\nprocesses that are poorly understood, such as\ndiffusive shock acceleration and magnetogenesis in collisionless shocks, and relate to regions of the cosmos, namely clusters outskirts,\nof which we know very little. Ongoing work\nwith radio interferometers, in particular with\nthe new LOFAR radio telescope is likely to\nbring great advances in these areas.\nIn these proceedings, we are going to\npresent some recent theoretical work that addresses the orientation of magnetic fields in\ncluster outskirts.\n\n2. Simulations of mergers\nIdealised simulations of clusters have\nbeen presented by Roettiger et al. (1993);\nSchindler & Mueller (1993); Pearce et al.\n(1994); Roettiger et al. (1997). Roettiger et al.\n(1993) simulated the head-on collision of\ngalaxy clusters with unequal mass, each of\nthem modelled as King-spheres. They used\nthe ZEUS code with a non-uniform grid and\nthe Hernquist (1987) treecode for the dark\nmatter. The simulations showed a bar of\nX-ray emission perpendicular to the collision\naxis that coincided with a shock of M \u223c 4.\nSchindler & Mueller (1993) used a uniform\ngrid-PPM code + an N-body code to study\nthe head-on collision of galaxy clusters.\nThey observed several shocks that lead to a\nsubstantial enhancement in X-ray luminosity\n(up to a factor of 2). Their simulation did\nnot include cooling. Later on, Burns et al.\n(1994) simulated the collision between the\nComa cluster and the group NGC 4839, using\n\n283\n\nthe ZEUS code with radiative cooling, and\nobtained similar results.\nNone of these works included the baryonic\ncontribution to the gravitational potential.\nPearce et al. (1994) simulated the headon collision between two equal-mass clusters using smoothed-particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) that includes, both, baryons and dark\nmatter. They found that the baryons end up\nin extended constant density cores after the\ncollision, whereas the dark matter does not.\nRoettiger et al. (1997) used a PPM/particlemesh code to simulate the radio relic in A754,\nvarying the impact parameter and mass ratios of the collision. Ricker (1998) presented\nsimulations of off-centre collisions between\nclusters using a PPM code with an isolated\nmultigrid solver for the gravitational potential. They studied how the virialisation time,\nthe structure of the merger and the X-ray\nluminosity enhancement depends on the impact parameter of the collision. They find\nthat the X-ray luminosity increases by a large\nfactor, which strongly depends on the impact parameter, and lasts for about half a\nsound crossing time after the cores interact. Virialisation takes about 5 sound crossing times. Ricker & Sarazin (2001) presented\na parameter study of off-centre collisions between galaxy clusters of two different mass\nratios. Using the Eulerian hydrodynamics/Nbody COSMOS code, they collide hydrostatic\nclusters with a \u03b2 model gas profile. They note\nthat the jumps in X-ray luminosity and temperature have important consequences for cosmological parameters derived from the observations of hot clusters at high redshift.\nRicker & Sarazin (2001) also find that mergers lead to large-scale turbulent motions with\neddy sizes of several hundred kpc and this turbulence is driven by dark matter-driven oscillations in the gravitational potential.\n\n2.1. Method\nThe simulations were performed with the multidimensional adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code FLASH code (Dubey et al.\n2009) version 3.2.\n\n\f284\n\nBr\u00fcggen: Cluster Outskirts\n\nA directionally unsplit staggered mesh algorithm (USM) that solves ideal and non-ideal\nMHD governing equations in multiple dimensions is newly implemented in this latest version of the code. The overall procedure of the\nUSM scheme can be broken up is described in\nthe FLASH manual and in Lee (2006) and Lee\nand Deane (2007).\nWe model the ICM as ideal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The density follows a \u03b2 profile\n\nand extract random values of its amplitude A\nand phase \u03c6. A is randomly extracted from\na Rayleigh distribution (in order to obtain a\nGaussian distribution for the real magnetic\nfield components, as frequently observed),\nwhile \u03c6 varies randomly from 0 to 2\u03c0. All three\ncomponents of magnetic field were treated independently which ensures that the final distribution of B(r) has random phase.\nThe magnetic field components in the\nFourier space are then obtained by:\n\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c10 [1 + (r/r0 )2 ]\u22123\u03b2/2 ,\n\nB\u0303(k) = ik \u00d7 \u00c3(k).\n\n\u221225\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 0.3, \u03c10 = 10 g/cm and r0 = 70\nkpc are parameters.\nThe temperature profile is taken to be\nT (r) = (T 0 +ar) [1\u2212(1+exp(\u2212(r\u2212rb )/b))\u22121 ], (2)\nwhere the parameters have been chosen to be\nT 0 = 3 \u00d7 107 K, a = \u22125.6 K/pc, b = 10 kpc and\nrb = 27 kpc.\nThe gravitational potential follows from\nthe assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium.\n!\n1 d\u03c1 dT\nkB\nd\u03c6\n(3)\nT\n=\n+\ndr\n\u03bcmH\n\u03c1 dr\ndr\nWe move the centre of the gravitational potential of cluster 1 on a trajectory around the\nfixed potential of cluster 2 and thus ignore all\ninteractions between dark matter.\nFurthermore, the hydrogen number density\nwas assumed to be related to the electron number density as nH = ne /1.2. We did not include\nthe effects of radiative cooling or star formation, as these are not very relevant for the spatial and temporal time scales considered here.\nWe set up an initially tangled magnetic\nfield that follows the thermal component according to:\n!\u03b7\nne (r)\n(4)\nhBi(r) = hB0 i\nn0\nwhere hB0 i is the mean magnetic field strength\nat the cluster center and n0 is the number density at the cluster centre.\nSimulations start considering a power\nspectrum for the vector potential A in the\nFourier domain:\n|Ak |2 \u221d k\u2212\u03b6\n\n(6)\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\nThe field components Bi in the real space\nare then derived using a 3D Fast Fourier\nTransform. The resulting magnetic field has the\nfollowing properties:\n1)\n\u2207 * B = 0,\n2) the magnetic field energy density associated\nwith each component Bk is:\n|Bk |2 = Cn2 k\u2212n ,\nn = \u03b6 \u2212 2, where Cn2 is the power spectrum\nnormalization,\n3)Bi has a Gaussian distribution, with hBi i = 0,\n\u03c3Bi = hB2i i,\n4) B has a Maxwellian distribution.\nFor n = 11/3, the above prescription would\ngive a Kolmogorov distribution of magnetic\nfields.\nOne can define \u039b = 2\u03c0\nk as the physical scale\nof the magnetic field fluctuations in the real\nspace. Thus in order to determine the magnetic\nfield power spectrum in the cluster, we have to\ndetermine three parameters: \u039bmin , \u039bmax and n.\nThere are several indications that the\nmagnetic field intensity decreases going from\nthe center to the periphery of a cluster. This\nis expected by magneto-hydrodynamical\nsimulations (see e.g. Dolag et al. 2008) and\nby spatial correlations found in some clusters\nbetween thermal and non-thermal energy\ndensities (Govoni et al. 2001).\n\n\fBr\u00fcggen: Cluster Outskirts\n\nFig. 1. Initial conditions: slices of logarithmic\ngas densities, magnetic fields, plasma \u03b2 and\npressure.\n\n3. Results\nHere we only have space to show a small part\nof our results. For further results we refer to\nan upcoming publication (Br\u00fcggen, Lee, van\nWeeren, R\u00f6ttgering in prep.). In Fig. 1 we show\nour initial conditions and in Fig. 2 we show\nslices of the gas density and magnetic field vectors in a head-on collision of two galaxy clusters at various times. These are quite representative of many of our simulations. Our main\nfindings can be summarised as follows:\n\u2013 Initially the magnetic fields become filamentary in wake of galaxy clusters as result\nof stretching.\n\u2013 As the clusters approach each other: enhancement of density, temperature and\nmagnetic field in the midplane magnetic\nfield is perpendicular to the shock axis\n\u2013 After centre-passage: shock waves run diametrically out of the cluster. Magnetic field\nis perpendicular to shock front.\n\u2013 Cluster gas dynamics gets dominated by\nlarge-scale flows and large eddies that\nshape the morphology of the cluster-wide\nfield. Along the merger axis, the flow is\nlargely directed outwards (away from the\ngravitational centres) along the axis. This\n\n285\n\nFig. 2. Slices of logarithmic gas densities (in\na zoomed region) with magnetic field vectors\nsuperimposed for an equal-mass head-on collision.\nresults in magnetic fields that are perpendicular to the outgoing merger shock\nwaves.\n\u2013 As the magnetic fields observed in the giant\nradio relic in CIZA J2242.8+530 lie within\nthe shock plane, these magnetic fields are\ndifficult to explain by a mere amplification\nof ambient magnetic fields.\nThese findings are consistent with what\nhas been found in MHD simulations by\n(Ruszkowski et al. 2010). They have performed full cosmological simulations of\ngalaxy cluster formation that simultaneously\ninclude magnetic fields, radiative cooling and\nanisotropic thermal conduction. The motivation behind this work was that in isolated and\nidealized cluster models, the magnetothermal\ninstability (MTI) tends to reorient the magnetic fields radially whenever the temperature gradient points in the direction opposite\nto gravitational acceleration. Using cosmological simulations of the Santa Barbara cluster\nRuszkowski. et al. (2010) have detected a radial bias in the velocity and magnetic fields.\nHowever, it was found that such radial bias\nis caused by the accretion of gas and substructure and not by MTI-driven field rear-\n\n\f286\n\nBr\u00fcggen: Cluster Outskirts\n\nrangements. The anisotropy effect is potentially detectable via radio polarization measurements with LOFAR and Square Kilometer\nArray and future X-ray spectroscopic studies with the International X-ray Observatory.\nFurthermore it was demonstrated that radiative\ncooling boosts the amplification of the magnetic field by about two orders of magnitude\nbeyond what is expected in the non-radiative\ncases. This effect is caused by the compression of the gas and frozen-in magnetic field\nas it accumulates in the cluster center. At z =\n0 the field is amplified by a factor of about\n106 compared to the uniform magnetic field\nevolved due to the universal expansion alone.\nInterestingly, the runs that include both radiative cooling and anisotropic thermal conduction exhibit stronger magnetic field amplification than purely radiative runs, especially at\nthe off-center locations. In these runs, shallow temperature gradients away from the cluster center make the ICM neutrally buoyant.\nThus, the ICM is more easily mixed in these regions and the winding up of the frozen-in magnetic field is more efficient resulting in stronger\nmagnetic field amplification.\nAcknowledgements.
