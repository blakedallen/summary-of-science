The main result of this paper is the theorem stating that every convex set\u2013\nvalued function F : I 7\u2192 c(Y ), where I \u2282 R is an interval and Y is locally convex space,\npossesses an affine selection. In the case if Y = R and the values of F are closed real\nintervals we can replace the assumption of convexity of F by the more general condition.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nK. Nikodem and Sz. Wasowicz\n \u0328\nhave proved (cf. [4, theorem 1]) that if the functions\nf, g : I 7\u2192 R, where I \u2282 R is an interval, fulfil for every x, y \u2208 I, t \u2208 [0, 1] the following\ncondition\n\u0001\nf tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2264 tg(x) + (1 \u2212 t)g(y),\n\u0001\ng tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2265 tf (x) + (1 \u2212 t)f (y),\nthen there exists an affine function h : I \u2192 R such that f \u2264 h \u2264 g on I. The simple\nconsequence of this fact is Theorem 1 which we prove at the beginning of this paper. Next\nwe prove that every convex set\u2013valued function F : I \u2192 c(Y ), where Y is a locally convex\nspace and c(Y ) is the family of all compact non\u2013empty subsets of Y , possesses an affine\nselection. In the case Y = Rn , n \u2208 N, we also present a direct inductive proof of this\ntheorem.\nNotation. By I we will denote any fixed real interval. If X is a topological vector space\nthen we admit the following notation:\nn(X) = { A \u2282 X : A 6= \u2205 }\nc(X) = { A \u2208 n(X) : A is a compact set }\ncc(X) = { A \u2208 c(X) : A is a convex set }.\nThe term set\u2013valued function will be abbreviated in the form s.v. function.\nIf X, Y are vector spaces and D \u2282 X is a convex set then we say that a s.v. function\nF : D \u2192 n(Y ) is\n(a) convex, if for every x, y \u2208 D, t \u2208 [0, 1]\n\u0001\ntF (x) + (1 \u2212 t)F (y) \u2282 F tx + (1 \u2212 t)y ;\n(b) concave, if for every x, y \u2208 D, t \u2208 [0, 1]\n\u0001\nF tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2282 tF (x) + (1 \u2212 t)F (y).\n\nA function f : D \u2192 Y is called the selection of the s.v. function F : D \u2192 n(Y ) iff\nf (x) \u2208 F (x) for every x \u2208 D.\nDate: 1993.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

R ESULTS\nLet us start with the translation of the theorem mentioned in the Introduction into the s.v.\nfunctions language (cf. [1, Remark 14]).\nTheorem 1. A s.v. function F : I \u2192 cc(R) possesses an affine selection iff for every\nx, y \u2208 I, t \u2208 [0, 1] the following condition holds\n\u0001\n(1)\nF tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2229 [tF (x) + (1 \u2212 t)F (y)] 6= \u2205.\nBefore we start the proof let us observe that (1) is the weakest condition guaranteeing\nthe existence of an affine selection for the s.v. function F .\nProof of Theorem 1. If there exists an affine selection f : I \u2192 R of the s.v. function F\nthen the condition (1) is obvious.\nLet us assume that the condition (1) holds for every x, y \u2208 I, t \u2208 [0, 1]. Let\nf (x) := inf F (x),\n\ng(x) := sup F (x),\n\nx \u2208 I.\n\nThen\n(2)\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF (x) = f (x), g(x) ,\n\nx\u2208I\n\nWe will show that f, g : I\u0001 \u2192\u0002R fulfil the condition \u0003(1) for any fixed x, y \u2208 I, t \u2208 [0, 1].\nLet z \u2208 F tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2229 tF (x) + (1 \u2212 t)F (y) . There exist z1 \u2208 F (x), z2 \u2208 F (y)\nsuch that z = tz1 + (1 \u2212 t)z2 . Using the definitions of f and g we get\n\u0001\nf tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2264 z = tz1 + (1 \u2212 t)z2 \u2264 tg(x) + (1 \u2212 t)g(y),\n\u0001\ng tx + (1 \u2212 t)y \u2265 z = tz1 + (1 \u2212 t)z2 \u2265 tf (x) + (1 \u2212 t)f (y).\nThen there exists an affine function h : I \u2192 R such that\n\n(3)\n\nf (x) \u2264 h(x) \u2264 g(x),\n\nx\u2208I\n\n(cf. [4, Theorem 1]). Conditions (2), (3) imply that h(x) \u2208 F (x), x \u2208 I, which completes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 2. It is well known that if a s.v. function F : I \u2192 cc(R) is convex (or concave)\nthen F has an affine selection. Applying the above theorem we get the new proof of this\nfact.\nRemark 3. The assumption of compactness of the sets F (x), x \u2208 I in Theorem 1 is\nessential. Consider two s.v. functions F : R \u2192 n(R) and G : (\u22121, 1) \u2192 n(R) defined by\nthe formulas\nF (x) = [x2 , +\u221e),\n2\n\nG(x) = (x , 1),\n\nx \u2208 R,\nx \u2208 (\u22121, 1).\n\nIt is easy to see that F and G are convex, but they do not have any affine selection.\nRemark 4. It is known (cf. [2, Remark 1], [4, Remark 2]) that a s.v. function F : D \u2192\ncc(R), where D \u2282 R2 is a convex set, need not possess any affine selection although F\nfulfils (1). We can also find the example of the s.v. function F : I \u2192 cc(R2 ) which\nfulfils (1) and does not have any affine selection. So, Theorem 1 can not be generalized\nboth for s.v. functions defined on the convex subset of the plane and for s.v. functions\nF : I \u2192 cc(R2 ). Below we present an example which is due to E. Sadowska from\nBielsko\u2013Bia\u0142a.\n\n\fON AFFINE SELECTIONS OF SET\u2013VALUED FUNCTIONS\n\n3\n\nLet I = [0, 4] (only in this remark) and F : I \u2192 cc(R2 ) be defined as follows\nF (0) = [\u22124, 4] \u00d7 {1},\nF (1) = {\u22121} \u00d7 [\u22124, 4],\nF (2) = [\u22124, 4] \u00d7 {\u22121},\nF (3) = {1} \u00d7 [\u22124, 4],\nF (4) = { (x, x) : x \u2208 [\u22124, 4] },\nF (x) = [\u22124, 4] \u00d7 [\u22124, 4] for all x \u2208 I \\ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}.\nOne can prove that F fulfils (1). We will show that F does not possess any affine selection.\nAn easy computation shows that the straight line\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2x = 1\u2212\u03be\ny = \u22121 \u2212 \u03be , \u03be \u2208 R\nl :\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3z =\u03be\nis the only line which intersects four segments F (0), F (1), F (2) and F (3). But l does not\nintersect the segment F (4). So the s.v. function F has not any affine selection.\nIt is well known that every continuous function f : I \u2192 I has a fixed point (if I is the\nclosed interval). On the second hand, every affine function f : I \u2192 I is continuous. So, as\na consequence of Theorem 1 we obtain the following\nCorollary 5. If the interval I is closed then every s.v. function F : I \u2192 cc(I) fulfilling (1)\nhas a fixed point (i.e. there exists a point x \u2208 I such that x \u2208 F (x)).\nNow we shall prove the main theorem of this paper. We present two proofs. One of them\nis an application of K. Nikodem's results (cf. [2]) and it requires the Axiom of Choice. The\nsecond one is direct and inductive but it works for finite\u2013dimensional spaces Rn .\nTheorem 6. Let Y be a locally convex topological vector space. Every convex s.v. function\nF : I \u2192 c(Y ) possesses an affine selection f : I \u2192 Y .\nProof. Let F : I \u2192 c(Y ) be a convex s.v. function. Then, in particular, F is a midconvex s.v. function (it fulfils the condition of convexity with t = 1/2), and so F possesses\nf (x)+f (y)\na Jensen selection f : I \u2192 Y i.e. f ( x+y\n, x, y \u2208 I (cf. [2, Lemma 2]).\n2 )=\n2\nSince F is continuous on Int I as a convex s.v. function defined on a subset of R (cf.\n[3, Theorem 3.7]), also f is continuous (cf. [3, Theorem 4.3] with K = {0}, G = F and\nF = f ). Thus f as a continuous Jensen function is an affine function, which completes the\nproof.\n\u0003\nIn the above proof we have used K. Nikodem's results which require the Lemma of\nKuratowski\u2013Zorn and some versions of the Theorem of Hahn\u2013Banach. Below we give an\ninductive proof in the case Y = Rn , n \u2208 N.\nSecond proof (for Y = Rn ). Before we start an induction on n let us notice that if F is\nconvex then the values of F are convex sets.\nIf n = 1 then our theorem follows directly from Remark 2. Assume that every convex\ns.v. function G : I \u2192 c(Rn ) has an affine selection g : I \u2192 Rn . Let F : I \u2192 c(Rn+1 ) be\na convex s.v. function. For any x \u2208 I we put\n\b\nG(x) := y \u2208 Rn : \u2203z\u2208R (y, z) \u2208 F (x)\n\n\f4\n\nSZYMON WASOWICZ\n \u0328\n\nIt is easy to verify that G(x) is a compact and non\u2013empty subset of Rn , i.e. G : I \u2192 c(Rn ).\nWe will check that G is a convex s.v. function. Fix any x1 , x2 \u2208 I, t \u2208 [0, 1]. Let\ny \u2208 tG(x1 )+(1\u2212t)G(x2 ). There exist yi \u2208 G(xi ), i = 1, 2, such that y = ty1 +(1\u2212t)y2 .\nSo there exist zi \u2208 R, i = 1, 2, such that (yi , zi ) \u2208 F (xi ), i = 1, 2. Let z = tz1 +(1\u2212t)z2 .\nSince F is convex we get\n(y, z) = t(y1 , z1 ) + (1 \u2212 t)(y2 , z2 )\n\u2208 tF (x1 ) + (1 \u2212 t)F (x2 ) \u2282 F (tx1 + (1 \u2212 t)x2 ).\nSo we obtain y \u2208 G(tx1 + (1 \u2212 t)x2 ).\nLet g : I \u2192 Rn be an affine selection of G. Let us define\n\b\n\u0001\nH(x) := z \u2208 R : g(x), z \u2208 F (x) ,\n\nx \u2208 I.\n\nObviously, H(x) is a compact and convex subset of R. From the fact that g(x) \u2208 G(x)\nwe get that H(x) 6= \u2205, x \u2208 I. So H : I \u2192 cc(R). It is not difficult to check that H is a\nconvex s.v. function.\n\u0001\nLet h : I \u2192 R be an affine selection of H. By putting f (x) := g(x), h(x) , x \u2208 I, we\nobtain an affine selection of the s.v. function F , which completes the proof.\n\u0003\nRemark 7. The above proof was obtained as a result of investigations if s.v. functions\nF : I \u2192 cc(Rn ) fulfilling the condition (1) possess an affine selection. First the author\nhoped that the method of decreasing of the dimension will give an effect in this case. But\nthe example in Remark 4 gave the negative answer of the mentioned problem. However in\nthe case of convex s.v. functions this direct method gives the simple way of constructing\nthe affine selections.\nRemark 8. It is known that convex s.v. functions F : D \u2192 cc(R), where D is a convex\nsubset of Rn , n \u2265 2, need not possess any affine selection (cf. [2, Remark 1]). However, if\nD is a convex cone with base in a real linear space, then every convex s.v. function defined\non D with compact values in a real locally convex space has an affine selection. It was\nobtained recently by A. Smajdor and W. Smajdor [5].\nRemark 9. It is known that the convex s.v. function F : I \u2192 c(Y ), where Y is a topological vector space are continuous. An application of our results gives another proof of this\nfact in the case when Y = Rn . Using Theorem 6 (for Y = Rn ) we obtain the existence of\nan affine selection f of F . Since f is affine and f : I \u2192 Rn , it must be continuous. Then\nF has a continuous selection, so F must be continuous on I (cf. [3, Theorem 3.3]).\nR EFERENCES\n1.
