Here we report acoustic band gap and localization in a 2D\nsystem of air-cylinders in water. Exact numerical calculations reveal the\nunexpected result that localization is relatively independent of the precise location\nor organization of the scatterers. Localization occurs within a finite region of\nfrequencies, coincident with the complete band gap predicted by a conventional\nband structure calculation for a periodic lattice of scatterers. Inside the gap or\nlocalization regime, a previously uninvestigated stable collective behavior of the\ncylinders appears.\nMultiple scattering of waves is responsible for a wide range of fascinating\nphenomena1,2. This includes twinkling light in the evening sky, modulation of ambient\nsound at the ocean surfaces3, and acoustic scintillation of turbulence4. On smaller scales,\nphenomena such as random lasers5 and electron transport in impure solids6 are also\nexplained by multiple scattering. Under appropriate conditions, multiple scattering leads\nto photonic or acoustic band gaps in classical wave propagation in periodic structures7,8,\nand to the unusual phenomenon of wave localization, a concept introduced by\n\n1\n\n\fAnderson9 to explain the conductor-insulator transition induced by disorders in\nelectronic systems.\nIn periodic structures, the wave dispersion bands are well understood in the\nrealm of Bloch's theorem and have been observed for optical systems7 and acoustic\nsystems8. In random scattering media, however, a peculiar phenomenon of wave\nlocalization may occur. In disordered solids, electron localization is common10. Random\nunderwater topography can give rise to water wave localization11. Localization effects\nhave also been reported for microwaves12,13, for light14, and for acoustic waves15,16,17,18\nin disordered media. Here we report acoustic localization in the strongly scattering 2D\nrandom arrays of air-cylinders in water, with comparison to the complete acoustic band\ngap of the corresponding regular arrays. We show that acoustic localization can be\nachieved in a range of frequencies, coincident with the complete band gap. Within the\nband gap or localized region, the system exhibits an interesting coherent behavior. A\nnew method is proposed to investigate the phase transition between localized and\nextended states. The approach enables to isolate the localization effect from that due to\nresidual absorption.\nMultiple scattering of waves is established by an infinite recursive pattern of\nrescattering between scatterers. In terms of wave field u , The energy flow in the system\nis calculated from J ~ Re[u ( \u2212 1)\u2207u ]. Writing u = u ei\u03b8 , the flow becomes\nJ ~ u \u2207\u03b8 , a Meissner equation. Obviously, the energy will be localized when phase\n2\n\n\u03b8 is a constant and u \u2260 0 . This simple perception will guide our following discussion.\nThe system is constructed by placing N uniform air-cylinders of radius a in\nwater perpendicular to the x \u2212 y plane to form either a square lattice with lattice constant\nd\n\nor a random array. Experimentally, the air-cylinders can be gas enclosures shelled by\n\na thin insignificant elastic layer, like the Albunex\uf6da bubbles used in echocardiography19.\nA unit acoustic pulsating line source transmitting monochromatic waves is placed at the\n\n2\n\n\fcenter of the array. Due to the large contrast in acoustic impedance between air and\nwater, the air-cylinders are strong acoustic scatterers. The scattered wave from each\ncylinder is a response to the total wave incident upon it. The total incident wave is\ncomposed of the direct contribution from the source and the multiply scattered waves\nfrom each of the other cylinders. The response function of a single cylinder is readily\ncomputed by a modal-series expansion in cylindrical coordinates, in the form of the\npartial wave solution, by invoking the usual boundary conditions that the pressure and\nthe radial velocity be continuous across the cylinder surface. Unlike the 3D bubble case,\nabsorption caused by thermal exchange and viscosity is unimportant20 and is not\nincluded in the model. Strong single cylinder scattering occurs for ka ranging from\nroughly 0.0005 to 0.5 with a resonant peak at ka \u2248 0.006 . Here k is the wavenumber and\na\n\nthe cylinder radius. In this range of ka , to which our attention is restricted, the radial\n\npulsating vibration of the cylinders provides the main contribution to the scattering.\nMultiple scattering in such a system can be calculated exactly, using a self-consistent\nmethod21 and a matrix inversion scheme18.\nEach cylinder acts as an effective secondary pulsating line source. The scattered\nwave from the i -th cylinder can be written as Ai H0(1) ( k | r - ri |) , where H0(1) is the zero-th\norder Hankel function of the first kind and ri denotes the position of the cylinder. The\ncomplex coefficients Ai represent the effective source strength, and are computed\nincorporating all orders of multiple scattering. The total wave at any space point is the\nsum of the direct wave from the transmitting source and the scattered wave from all the\ncylinders.\nWe express Ai as Ai exp( j\u03b8i ) , with j = \u2212 1 and i = 1,2 ,..., N . The modulus\nAi represents the strength and \u03b8i the oscillation phase of the i -th scatterer relative to\nthe actual source. A unit vector u i , hereafter termed the phase vector, is associated with\neach phase \u03b8i , and these vectors are represented on a phase diagram in the x \u2212 y plane.\n\n3\n\n\fThe starting point of each phase vector is positioned at the center of its corresponding\ncylinder and oriented at an angle with respect to the positive x -axis equal to the phase:\nu i = cos\u03b8i e x + sin \u03b8i e y . Numerical experiments are carried out to study the behavior of the\n\nphases of the cylinders and the spatial distribution of the acoustic energy. The fraction\nof area occupied by the cylinders per unit area \u03b2 is set to 10\u22123 , and the total number of\nscatterers N is at least 200. The lattice parameter d , or the average distance between\nneighboring cylinders in the random case, is calculated as d ~ (\u03c0 / \u03b2 ) 1 / 2 a .\nFigure 1 presents the far field transmitted intensity as a fraction of what it would\nin the absence of scatterers. It is plotted as a function of frequency in terms of the\ndimensionless parameter ka for an ordered square lattice, and for a random array of the\nscatterers. Inside a finite frequency range, transmission is significantly inhibited for\nboth cases; this inhibition indicates that waves cannot escape, rather they are trapped in\nthe vicinity of the source. Interestingly, the presence and qualitative features of the\nlocalization regime are not changed between the ordered and random configurations.\nThe main effect of the added disorder is to smooth out the upper edge of the localized\nregime. We have observed that increasing or decreasing \u03b2, which decreases or increases\nthe nearest-neighbor separation, causes this edge to move upwards or downwards\nrespectively. It is likely then that the smoothing effect observed in the random\nconfiguration is due to the introduction of a distribution in nearest neighbor separations.\nWe can compare the transmission inhibition behavior, in the ordered case, with a\nconventional band structure calculation. The band structure is shown in Figure 2. We\nobserve the presence of a complete acoustic band gap between ka = 0.007 and 0.03,\nwhich matches with the transmission inhibition regime indicated in Figure 1. In this\nregion, the system has no propagation modes in any direction. It is also observed that if\n\n\u03b2 is reduced, the gap narrows.\n\n4\n\n\fWe further explore how the system behaves for frequencies below, within and\nabove the gap and localization regimes, in connection to the phase vectors. Figures 3\nand 4 show respectively the resulting phase vectors and the energy distribution for three\nfrequencies for both regular and random arrays.\nFor frequencies below the gap or localization regime, there is no obvious\nordering for the phase vectors u i , nor for the energy distribution. The case of\nka = 0.0048 is representative; the phase vectors point to various directions, and no\n\nenergy localization appears. In the ordered case, this behavior is due to boundary\neffects. In effect, as the wave is not localized, it can travel through the array and is\nreflected by the cylinders near the asymmetric border; all cylinders experience the effect\nthrough strong multiple scattering. In the random arrays, not only does the boundary\nplay a role, but the random placement of cylinders also contributes to the random phase\nand energy distribution.\nAs the frequency increases into the localized or gap regime, an ordering among\nthe phase vectors indeed becomes evident. This is shown for ka = 0.01 for both random\nand ordered arrays. Amazingly, all cylinders oscillate completely in phase, but exactly\nout of phase with the transmitting source. Such collective behavior allows for efficient\ncancellation of incoming waves. Both the regular and random cases clearly show that\nenergy is trapped or localized near the source, decaying exponentially with distance\nfrom it. The localization length, defined as the inverse of the decay rate in the random\ncase, increases steadily as ka increases through the localized regime, causing the\ntransmission in Figure 1 to increase towards the upper regime edge. At ka = 0.01, the\nlocalization length is about 30a . The exponential energy decay occurs for frequencies\nwithin the complete band gap of the corresponding ordered case. The wave localization\nis independent of the outer boundary and always appears for sufficiently large \u03b2 and\nN.\n\nSuch localization and phase behavior is related to the particular scattering properties\n\n5\n\n\fof the air-cylinders. In the context of field theory22, the global collective phenomenon\nimplies a symmetry breaking and appearance of a certain kind of Goldstone mode.\nWhen the frequency is increased beyond the upper gap or localized regime edge,\nthe in-phase ordering disappears. Meanwhile, the wave becomes extended again. This is\nillustrated by the case of ka = 0.035 . Although the cylinders do not oscillate in phase,\nthere is a periodic pattern in the phase vectors for the regular case: the cylinders at equal\ndistance from the source have the same phase vectors. This is explained by weak\nmultiple scattering. When multiple scattering is weak, the cylinders are mainly driven\nby the direct incident wave from the source; therefore the phase \u03b8i of the i -th cylinder\napproximates k ri plus a constant phase from the response function of the cylinder. The\npattern reflects the periodic arrangement of the cylinders, and the energy distribution\nhas a matching periodicity.\nWe emphasize that the localization features in the random array case are not due\nto the finite size or boundaries of the scatterer arrays. When the sample size is increased\nwhile the cylinder concentration is kept constant, inside the localization regime the\nexponential energy decay continues at an unchanged rate, while the wave remains nonlocalized for frequencies outside the localization range. Moreover, the cylinder\nscattering strength is actually stronger at ka = 0.005 than it is at ka = 0.01 . If the\nbehavior of the system were continuous from ka = 0.01 to 0.005, according to theories\nwe would expect the stronger scattering strength at ka = 0.005 to result in a stronger\nlocalization. This does not occur. In effect, the phase diagrams in Figure 4 clearly\nindicate that the states at ka = 0.005 , ka = 0.01 and ka = 0.035 belong to different\nphase states of the system.\nWe have demonstrated a new localization phase transition in acoustic\npropagation in the 2D random distribution of uniform air cylinders and their connection\nto the complete band gaps in the corresponding lattice arrangements, and we suggest\n\n6\n\n\fthat such a transition is related to the collective behavior of the scatterers. These results\nare special, in that they apply to the particular case of isotropic resonant scatterers, and\nalso surprising, in that they are insensitive to details of the spacing of the scatterers.\nAlthough these properties may not hold in general, the fact that they do for resonant aircylinders makes these scatterers ideal for theoretical and experimental localization\nstudies.\n\n1.

Acoustic bands for a square lattice of air-cylinders in water. The\nfrequency is expressed in terms of non-dimensional ka . The complete band gap\nlies between the two horizontal dotted lines.\nFigure 2. Acoustic transmission vs. frequency ( ka ) for three sample sizes. The\nresults are normalized such that the transmission equals unity when no\nscatterers are present.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 3: Left column: Phase diagrams for the two-dimensional phase vectors\nu i lying on the x \u2212 y plane. Right column: Spatial distribution of acoustic energy\n\n(arbitrary scale). Here the x and y axes give the cylindrical positions in units of\nthe cylinder radius a . The z -axis of the energy distribution plots gives the\nenergy density in log scale relative to what it would be for an unscattered\nsource in empty space. Plotting the relative energy density in this way removes\nuninteresting geometric spreading.\nFigure 4: The phase diagram and energy distribution for the case of a random\narray of air-cylinders in water.
