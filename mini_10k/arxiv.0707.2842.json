The\nworkspace topology is defined by the number of cusps and nodes\nthat appear on these singular curves.

Most\nindustrial regional structures have the same kinematic\narchitecture, namely, a vertical revolute joint followed by two\nparallel joints, like the Puma. Such manipulators are always\nnoncuspidal (i.e. must meet a singularity to change their\nposture) and they have four inverse kinematic solutions (IKS)\nfor all points in their workspace (assuming unlimited joints).\nThis paper focuses on alternative manipulator designs, namely,\npositioning 3R manipulators with orthogonal joint axes\n(orthogonal manipulators). Orthogonal manipulators may have\ndifferent global kinematic properties according to their link\nlengths and joint offsets. They may be cuspidal, that is, they\ncan change their posture without meeting a singularity [1, 2]. In\n1998, ABB-Robotics launched the IRB 6400C, a 6R\nmanipulator to be used in the car industry and designed to\nminimize the swept volume. The only difference with the Puma\nwas the permutation of the first two link axes, resulting in a\nmanipulator with all its joint axes orthogonal, and cuspidal.\nCommercialization of the IRB 6400C was finally stopped one\nyear later. Exact reason is beyond the knowledge of the authors\nbut the cuspidal behavior is likeable to have disappointed the\nend users. Cuspidal robots were unknown before 1988 [3],\nwhen a list of conditions for a manipulator to be noncuspidal\nwas provided [4, 5]. This list includes simplifying geometric\nconditions like parallel and intersecting joint axes [4] but also\nnonintuitive conditions [5]. A general necessary and sufficient\ncondition for a 3-DOF manipulator to be cuspidal was\nThis work was supported in part by C.N.R.S. MathStic program \"Cuspidal\nrobots and triple roots\".\n\nestablished in [6], namely, the existence of at least one point in\nthe workspace where the inverse kinematics admits three equal\nsolutions. The word \"cuspidal manipulator\" was defined in\naccordance to this condition because a point with three equal\nIKS forms a cusp in a cross section of the workspace [4, 7].\nThe categorization of all generic 3R manipulators was\nestablished in [8] based on the homotopy class of the singular\ncurves in the joint space. [9] proposed a procedure to take into\naccount the cuspidality property in the design process of new\nmanipulators. More recently, [10] applied efficient algebraic\ntools to the classification of 3R orthogonal manipulators with\nno offset on their last joint. Five surfaces were found to divide\nthe parameters space into 105 cells where the manipulators\nhave the same number of cusps in their workspace. The\nequations of these five surfaces were derived as polynomials in\nthe DH-parameters using Groebner Bases. A kinematic\ninterpretation of this theoretical work was conducted in [11] :\nthe authors analyzed general kinematic properties of one\nrepresentative manipulator in each cell. Only five different\ncases were found to exist. However, the classification in [11]\ndid not provide the equations of the separating surfaces in the\nparameters space for the five cells associated with the five\ncases found. On the other hand, [11] did not take into account\nthe occurrence of nodes, which play an important role for\nanalyzing the number of IKS in the workspace.\nThe purpose of this work is to classify a family of 3R\npositining manipulators according to the topology of their\nworkspace, which is defined by the number of cusps and nodes\nthat appear on the singular curves. The design parameters space\nis shown to be divided into nine domains of distinct workspace\ntopologies, in which all manipulators have similar global\nkinematic properties. This study is of interest for the design of\nnew manipulators.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Next section\npresents the manipulators under study and recalls some\npreliminary results. The classification is established in section\nIII. Section IV synthesizes the results and section V concludes\nthis paper.\nII.\n\nPRELIMINARIES\n\nA. Manipulators under study\nThe manipulators studied in this paper are orthogonal with\ntheir last joint offset equal to zero. The remaining lengths\nparameters are referred to as d2, d3, d4, and r2 while the angle\nparameters \u03b12 and \u03b13 are set to \u201390\u00b0 and 90\u00b0, respectively. The\n\n\fthree joint variables are referred to as \u03b81, \u03b82 and \u03b83,\nrespectively. They will be assumed unlimited in this study.\nFigure 1 shows the kinematic architecture of the manipulators\nunder study in the zero configuration. The position of the endtip (or wrist center) is defined by the three Cartesian\ncoordinates x, y and z of the operation point P with respect to a\nreference frame (O, x, y, z) attached to the manipulator base as\nshown in Fig. 1.\nz\n\ny\nO\n\n\u03b82\nr2\n\nd2\n\n\u03b81\n\nx\n\n\u03b83\n\nd3\nd4\n\n.\nP\n\nIf d3\u2264d4, the operation point can meet the second joint axis\nwhenever \u03b83=\u00b1arccos(-d3/d4) and two horizontal lines appear,\nwhich may intersect S1 and S2 depending on d2, d3, d4 and r2\n[12]. The number of aspect depends on these intersections.\nNote that if d3<d4, no additional curve appears in the workspace\ncross-section but only two points where the operation point\nmeets the second joint axis and the manipulator has an infinite\nnumber of IKS. Fig. 3 shows the singularity curves when d2=1,\nd3=3, d4=4 and r2=2. The singular line defined by \u03b83=+arccos(d3/d4) maps onto one singular point in the workspace crosssection, which is located at the self-intersection of the internal\nsingular boundary. The remaining singular line \u03b83=\u2013arccos(d3/d4) maps onto an isolated singular point in the workspace.\nThe workspace topology of this manipulator features two cusps\nand three nodes, two regions with two IKS and two regions\nwith four IKS. In the following section, the complete\nclassification is established.\n\nFigure 1. Orthogonal manipulators under study.\n\nB. Singularities and aspects\nThe determinant of the Jacobian matrix of the orthogonal\nmanipulators under study is\ndet(J) = (d3 + c3d4)(s3d2 + c2(s3d3 \u2013 c3r2))\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ci=cos(\u03b8i) and si=sin(\u03b8i). A singularity occurs when\ndet(J)=0. Since the singularities are independent of \u03b81, the\ncontour plot of det(J)=0 can be displayed in\n\u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8 2 < \u03c0 , \u2212 \u03c0 \u2264 \u03b8 3 < \u03c0 where they form a set of curves. If\nd3>d4, the first factor of det(J) cannot vanish and the\nsingularities form two distinct curves S1 and S2 in the joint\nspace [12]. S1 and S2 divide the joint space into two singularityfree open sets A1 and A2 called aspects [1]. The singularities\ncan be also displayed in the Cartesian space [13, 14]. Thanks to\ntheir symmetry about the first joint axis, a 2-dimensional\nrepresentation in a half cross-section of the workspace is\nsufficient. The singularities form two disjoint sets of curves in\nthe workspace. These two sets define the internal boundary\nWS1 and the external boundary WS2, respectively, with\nWS1=f(S1) and WS2=f(S2). Fig. 2 (left) shows the singularity\ncurves when d2=1, d3=2,\nd4=1.5 and r2=1. For this\nmanipulator, the internal boundary WS1 has four cusp points. It\ndivides the workspace into one region with two IKS (the outer\nregion) and one region with four IKS (the inner region).\n\n4\n\n2\n\nFigure 2. Singularity curves in joint space (left) and workspace (right,\nnumber of IKS in each region is indicated).\n\nFigure 3.\n\nSingularity curves when d3<d4. The two horizontal singular lines\nmaps onto isolated singular points in the workspace.\n\nIII. WORKSPACES CLASSIFICATION\nA. Classification criteria\nThe classification is conducted on the basis of the topology\nof the singular curves in the workspace, which we characterize\nby (i) the number of cusps and (ii) the number of nodes or\nintersecting points. A cusp (resp. a node) is associated with one\npoint with three equal IKS (resp. with two pairs of equal IKS).\nThese singular points are interesting features for characterizing\nthe workspace shape and the accessibility in the workspace.\nB. Number of cusps\nFor now on and without loss of generality, d2 is set to 1.\nThus, we need handle only three parameters d3, d4 and r2.\nEfficient computational algebraic tools were used in [10] to\nprovide the equations of five separating surfaces, which were\nshown to divide the parameter space into 105 cells. But [11]\nshowed that only 5 cells should exist, which means that one or\nmore surfaces among the five ones found in [10] are not\nrelevant. However, [11] did not try to find which surfaces are\nreally separating. To derive the equations of the true separating\nsurfaces, we need to investigate the transitions between the five\ncases. First, let us recall the five different cases found in [11].\nThe first case is a binary manipulator (i.e. it has only two IKS)\nwith no cusp and a hole (Fig. 4). The remaining four cases are\nquaternary manipulators (i.e. with four IKS). The second case\nis a manipulator with four cusps on the internal boundary. Fig.\n5 shows a manipulator of this case with a hole and two nodes.\nNote that the manipulator shown in Fig. 2 is another instance of\n\n\fcase 2, although it has no node and no hole (see section C).\nTransition between case 1 and case 2 is a manipulator having a\npair of points with four equal IKS, where two nodes and one\ncusp coincide [15].\n\nd4 =\n\nd3\n\u22c5A\n1 + d3\n\n(4)\n\nwhere A is given by (3).\nThe fourth case is a manipulator with four cusps. Unlike case 2,\nthe cusps are not located on the same boundary (Fig. 7).\n\nFigure 4. Manipulator of case 1.\n\nFigure 7. Manipulator of case 4.\n\nTransition between case 3 and case 4 is characterized by a\nmanipulator for which the singular line given by \u03b83=\u2013arccos(d3/d4) is tangent to the singularity curve S2 [15]. Expressing this\ncondition yields the equation of the separating surface\nFigure 5. Manipulator of case 2.\n\nDeriving the condition for the inverse kinematic polynomial\nto have four equal roots yields the equation of the separating\nsurface [15]\n\nd4 =\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(d3 + r2 )2 \u2212 d3 + r2 \u239e\n1\u239b 2\n2\n\u239f\n\u239c d3 + r2 \u2212\n2\u239d\nAB\n\u23a0\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\nA = ( d 3 + 1)2 + r2 and B = ( d 3 \u2212 1)2 + r2 .\n2\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe third case is a manipulator with only two cusps on the\ninternal boundary, which looks like a fish with one tail (Fig. 6).\nAs shown in next section, an intermediate state exists between\nthe manipulator shown in Fig. 5 and the one depicted in Fig. 6.\nThis intermediate state is a variant of case 2 with two nodes and\nno hole (the upper and lower segments of the internal boundary\ncross, forming a '2-tail fish', see Fig. 11).\n\nd3\n(5)\n\u22c5 B and d 3 > 1\nd3 \u2212 1\nwhere B is given by (3). As shown in next section, an\nintermediate state exists between the manipulator shown in Fig.\n6 and the one depicted in Fig. 7. This intermediate state is a\nvariant of case 3, which features two additional nodes that\nresult from the intersection of the two workspace boundaries\n(like in Fig. 3).\nd4 =\n\nLast case is a manipulator with no cusp. Unlike case 1, the\ninternal boundary does not bound a hole but a region with 4\nIKS. The two isolated singular points inside the inner region\nare associated with the two singularity lines.\n\nFigure 8. Manipulator of case 5.\n\nTransition between case 4 and case 5 is characterized by a\nmanipulator for which the singular line given by \u03b83=+arccos(d3/d4) is tangent to the singularity curve S1 [15]. Expressing this\ncondition yields the equation of the separating surface\nFigure 6. Manipulator of case 3.\n\nAs shown in [15], transition between case 2 and case 3 is\ncharacterized by a manipulator for which the singular line\ngiven by \u03b83=\u2013arccos(-d3/d4) is tangent to the singularity curve\nS1. Expressing this condition yields the equation of the\nseparating surface\n\nd3\n(6)\n\u22c5 B and d 3 < 1\n1 \u2212 d3\nWe have provided the equations of four surfaces that divide\nthe parameters space into five domains where the number of\ncusps is constant. Fig. 9 shows the plots of these surfaces in a\nsection (d3, d4) of the parameter space for r2=1. Domains 1, 2,\n3, 4 and 5 are associated with manipulators of case 1, 2, 3, 4\nand 5, respectively. C1, C2, C3 and C4 are the right hand side of\nd4 =\n\n\fsurface.\n\n(2), (4), (5) and (6), respectively.\n\nC. Number of nodes\nIn this section, we investigate each domain according to the\nnumber of nodes in the workspace.\n1) Domain 1\nSince all manipulators in this domain are binary, they\ncannot have any node in their workspace. Thus, all\nmanipulators in domain 1 have the same workspace topology,\nnamely, 0 node, 0 cusp and a hole inside their workspace. This\nworkspace topology is referred to as WT1.\n\nFigure 9. Plots of the four separating surfaces in a section (d3, d4) of the\nparameter space for r2=1.\n\nIt is interesting to see the correspondence between the\nequations found with pure algebraic reasoning in [10] and those\nprovided in this paper.

Transition\nbetween these two workspace topologies is one such that the\ntwo lateral segments of the internal boundary meet tangentially\n(Fig. 10).\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n6\n\n(9)\n\n+ d 4 r2 + 2d 4 r2 = 0\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\nd3 r2 + d 3 \u2212 2d 3 + d 3 \u2212 d 4 + 2d3 d 4 \u2212 d 3 d 4 = 0\n\n(10)\n\nd 3 r2 + d 3 + 2d 3 + d 3 \u2212 d 4 \u2212 2d 3 d 4 \u2212 d 3 d 4 = 0\n\n(11)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nEquation (9) is a second-degree polynomial in d42.

The first branch is the\nseparating surface d4=C1 between domains 1 and 2.\n\nEquation (10) is a second-degree polynomial in d4. By\nsolving this quadratics for d4 and assuming strictly positive\nvalues for d4 and r2, (10) can be rewritten as\n\nFigure 10.

Also, the nodes do not bound a hole like in Fig. 5\nbut a region with four IKS (Fig. 10).\n\nd3\nd\n\u22c5 B and d 3 > 1) or ( d 4 = 3 \u22c5 B and d 3 < 1)\nd3 \u2212 1\n1 \u2212 d3\nwhere B is defined in (3).

Workspace topology WT4.\n\nTransition between WT3 and WT4 is a workspace topology\n\n\fsuch that the upper and lower segments of the internal\nboundary meet tangentially (Fig. 12).\n\nNo subcase exist in this domain [15]. Such topologies are\nreferred to as WT7.\nIV. RESULTS SYNTHESIS\nA. Parameter space partition\nTaking into account the nodes in the classification results in\na new partition of the parameter space, as shown in Fig. 15,\nwhere E1, E2 and E3 are the right hand side of (12), (13) and\n(14), respectively. Figure 15 depicts a section (d3, d4) of the\nparameter space for r2=1.\n\nFigure 12. Transition between WT3 and WT4.\n\nAs shown in [15], this transition is the occurrence of the\nadditional singularity d3 + c3d4 = 0, that is\n7\n\nd4=d3\n\n(13)\n\n3) Domains 3 and 5\nThe internal boundary has either 2 cusp (domain 3) or 0\ncusp (domain 5). This boundary is either fully inside the\nexternal boundary (like in Figs 6 and 8), or it can cross the\nexternal boundary, yielding two nodes as in Fig. 3 and 13.\nThus, domain 3 (resp. domain 5) contains two distinct\nworkspace topologies, which we call WT5 (1 node) and WT6\n(resp. WT8 and WT9).\n\nFigure 15. Parameter space partition according to the number of cusps and\nnodes (in a section r2=1).\n\nPlots of the separating surfaces in sections for different\nvalues of r2 are shown in Fig. 16.\n\nTransition between WT5 and WT6 and transition between\nWT8 and WT9 are such that the internal boundary meets the\nexternal boundary tangentially (Fig. 14).\n\nWT9\n\nWT7\n\nWT9\n\nFigure 13.

Separating surfaces for different values of r2.\n\nThe areas associated with WT1, WT2, WT7 and WT9 decrease\nwhen r2 increases. The area associated with WT4 is very tiny,\nespecially for small values of r2. This means that few\nmanipulators have a topology of the WT4 type.\n\n\fclassification tree shows that a 3R orthogonal manipulator has\neither 2 aspects (if d3>d4), or it is quaternary and has no hole in\nits workspace (if d3<d4). The second level shows that (i) a 3R\northogonal manipulator with 2 aspects is either quaternary with\n4 cusps (if d4>C1), or binary with no cusp, no node and a hole\n(if d4<C1) and (ii) a 3R orthogonal quaternary manipulator may\nhave 4 cusps and 6 aspects (if d4>C3 or d4<C2), or 2 cusps and\n5 aspects (if C2<d4<C3 and d4<C4), or 0 cusp and 4 aspects (if\nd4>C4).\n\nB. Classification tree\nA multi-level classification of the 3R orthogonal\nmanipulators under study can be established by the\nclassification tree shown in Fig. 17. For more legibility, only\nthe generic cases are reported on this tree (i.e. manipulators on\nthe separating surfaces of the parameter space are not reported).\nThe root of the tree is the set of all manipulators under study\nand each leave is the set of manipulators with a completely\nspecified workspace topology.

Classification tree.\n\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nA family of 3R manipulators was classified according to the\ntopology of the workspace, which was defined as the number\nof cusps and nodes. The design parameters space was shown to\nbe divided into nine domains of distinct workspace topologies.\nEach separating surface was given as an explicit expression in\nthe DH-parameters. Further work will investigate each domain\naccording to various interesting design criteria.\nREFERENCES\n[1] C.V. Parenti and C.
