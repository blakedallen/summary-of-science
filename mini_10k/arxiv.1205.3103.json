The clusters span redshifts 0.28 < z < 0.43 and\nhave masses M500 > 2 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M , and three of the five clusters were discovered by the SPT\nsurvey. We observed the clusters in the g 0 r0 i0 passbands with the Megacam imager on the Magellan\nClay 6.5m telescope. We measure a mean ratio of weak lensing (WL) aperture masses to inferred\naperture masses from the SZ data, both within an aperture of R500,SZ derived from the SZ mass, of\n1.04 \u00b1 0.18. We measure a mean ratio of spherical WL masses evaluated at R500,SZ to spherical SZ\nmasses of 1.07 \u00b1 0.18, and a mean ratio of spherical WL masses evaluated at R500,WL to spherical\nSZ masses of 1.10 \u00b1 0.24. We explore potential sources of systematic error in the mass comparisons\nand conclude that all are subdominant to the statistical uncertainty, with dominant terms being\ncluster concentration uncertainty and N -body simulation calibration bias.

W. High et al.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe abundance of galaxy clusters as a function of mass\nand redshift is sensitive to dark energy and other cosmological parameters through the growth function of largescale structure (LSS) and the cosmological volume element (e.g., Wang & Steinhardt 1998; Haiman et al. 2001;\nHolder et al. 2001; Weller & Battye 2003). As emphasized by the Dark Energy Task Force (Albrecht et al.\n2006), the abundance of clusters provides constraints on\ndark energy that are complementary to those of distanceredshift relations, such as standard candles and rulers\nincluding Type Ia supernovae (SNe) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). Recent results using this method\nhave shown that cluster surveys can significantly improve\nthe best current constraints on cosmological parameters,\nparticularly the dark energy equation of state (Vikhlinin\net al. 2009b; Mantz et al. 2010b; Rozo et al. 2010; Benson\net al. 2011; Reichardt et al. 2012).\nThe Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich (SZ) effect offers a novel way\nto search for high-redshift, massive clusters, which are\nparticularly useful for constraining cosmology (e.g., Carlstrom et al. 2002). The SZ effect is the inverse Compton\nscattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons by the hot electrons in the intracluster medium. SZ\nobservables are nearly redshift independent, and moreover, are expected from simulations and observations to\ntrace total cluster mass with low intrinsic scatter (e.g.,\nKravtsov et al. 2006; Benson et al. 2011). To extract constraints on cosmological parameters, the cluster redshifts\nmust be measured with optical and infrared follow-up\nobservations and the cluster masses must be estimated\nusing accurately calibrated proxies.\nThe South Pole Telescope (SPT; Carlstrom et al. 2011)\nis a millimeter-wavelength telescope that recently completed a 2500 deg2 SZ cluster survey. A catalog from\nthe first 720 deg2 of the survey has been released that\nincludes 224 cluster candidates, 158 of which have confirmed optical or infrared galaxy cluster counterparts\nwith redshifts as high as z = 1.37, a median redshift\nof 0.55, and a median mass of M500 \u2248 2.3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M\n(Reichardt et al. 2012, hereafter R12). Using the 100\ncluster candidates at z > 0.3 above the SPT 95%-purity\nthreshold, the SPT cluster data have been combined with\nCMB+BAO+H0 +SNe data to provide constraints on the\ndark energy equation of state of w = \u22121.010 \u00b1 0.058, a\nfactor of 1.3 improvement over the constraints without\nthe cluster abundance data. However, this improvement\nwas limited by the \u223c 10% uncertainty in the SPT cluster\nmass calibration.\nThe method to determine the masses of clusters in\nthe SPT survey is described in detail by Benson et al.\nCleveland, OH 44106\n29 Physics Department, University of Minnesota, 116 Church\nStreet S.E., Minneapolis, MN 55455\n30 Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Dr., Baltimore, MD 21218\n31 Liberal Arts Department, School of the Art Institute of\nChicago, 112 S Michigan Ave, Chicago, IL 60603\n32 Department of Physics, Yale University, P.O. Box 208210,\nNew Haven, CT 06520-8120\n33 Argelander-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie, Universit\u00e4t Bonn, Auf\ndem H\u00fcgel 71, 53121, Bonn, Germany\n34 Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, Department of\nPhysics, University of California, and Lawrence Berkeley National\nLabs, Berkeley, CA 94720\n\n(2011, hereafter B11). In brief, the mass estimates are\ncomputed from the SPT SZ data, and are calibrated to\nscale with total mass using a combination of X-ray observations and cluster simulations. For a subset of the\nSPT survey cluster sample, X-ray observations have been\nobtained to measure YX , the product of the X-ray derived gas mass and core-excised temperature. This is\nused in combination with a YX -mass relation that is calibrated at low-redshift (z < 0.3) using X-ray derived hydrostatic mass estimates of relaxed clusters (Vikhlinin\net al. 2009a). The calibration of the YX \u2013mass relation\nis expected to be accurate to 10% based on simulations\n(Nagai et al. 2007), and has been empirically verified to\nhave this level of accuracy using weak lensing (WL) observations of the same clusters (Hoekstra 2007).\nWL here refers to the subtle tangential shearing of\nextended sources behind cluster halos, at projected distances well outside the Einstein radius (for a review, see\nBartelmann & Schneider 2001). Gravitational lensing\nis sensitive to total projected mass and has the benefit\nof being insensitive to the dynamical state of the lens:\nthe observables are independent of whether the cluster\ngas or galaxies are in hydrostatic equilibrium. WL mass\nestimates have been used to test the accuracy of X-ray\nmass estimates (e.g., Hoekstra 2007; Mahdavi et al. 2008;\nZhang et al. 2008); however, these works have not explicitly cross-checked the YX -mass calibration of Vikhlinin\net al. (2009a), and have used clusters predominantly at\nlow redshift (z < 0.3) that are outside the SPT survey\nregion.\nAs the first steps toward a WL-based calibration of the\nSPT cluster sample, we have observed five clusters from\nthe SPT survey with the Magellan Clay-Megacam CCD\nimager. The five clusters span redshifts 0.28 < z < 0.43\nand were selected from the SPT catalog of R12 from a\nsubset of clusters with existing or scheduled observations\nby either the Chandra or XMM-Newton X-ray spacetelescopes. From this SZ\u2013plus\u2013X-ray sample, we randomly selected five clusters that were observable during\nawarded telescope time and which were at 0.3 . z . 0.5.\nThe X-ray analyses for these clusters are in progress. We\nhave also obtained multi-object spectroscopy of cluster\nmembers for precise redshift measurements of four of the\nclusters.\nThe primary goal of this paper is to provide the first\ndirect comparison of the SZ and X-ray derived mass estimates of R12 to WL mass measurements. We employ aperture masses, which are largely insensitive to the\nproperties of cluster cores, and have been shown in previous works to scale well with other, low-scatter mass\nobservables (e.g., Hoekstra 2007; Mahdavi et al. 2008).\nWe also use spherical masses by fitting the WL shear\ndata to analytic profiles.\nMagnitudes are in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) AB system unless otherwise noted. We adopt\na flat \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9M = 0.27 and H0 =\n70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Komatsu et al. 2011). Masses M\u2206 are\ndefined at radius R\u2206 , where the mean interior density is\n\u2206 times the critical density of the universe at the cluster's\nepoch, \u03c1crit (z) = 3H 2 (z)/8\u03c0G, and H(z) is the Hubble\nparameter.\n2. THE CLUSTER SAMPLE\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\nIn this section, we provide an overview of the larger\nsample of clusters from which we selected targets for WL\nfollow-up. We briefly discuss SZ detection with SPT, the\nSZ cluster center determination, and SZ mass estimation.\nWe then discuss the cluster spectroscopic redshift measurements of four of the five systems selected for WL observations. Table 1 summarizes these basic cluster data.\n2.1. SZ Cluster Detection\nThe clusters were selected from the R12 SPT cluster\nsurvey catalog. That work contains details of the sample, the SPT data from which it was extracted, and the\ncluster extraction process. In summary, \u223c720 deg2 of\nsky were surveyed by the SPT in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons to a depth such that the median mass\nof a cluster detected is M500 \u2248 2.3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M . Cluster candidates are extracted from the data using a multifrequency matched filter (Melin et al. 2006). Twelve\ndifferent matched filters are used spanning a range of\nangular scales for the assumed cluster profile, and the\ncluster candidates are ranked by the maximum detection\nsignificance across all filter scales, defined as \u03be. All candidates with \u03be \u2265 4.5 are included in the catalog, with\n\u03be also used as the primary observable to determine the\ncluster mass. SZ significance maps for the five clusters\ndiscussed in this work are shown in the Appendix.\nWe use the SZ detection positions as the cluster centers in the baseline WL analysis, although we explore\nthe effect of using other positions as well. The statistical\nuncertainty in SZ-determined positions is a function of\nthe cluster size, the SPT beam size (FWHM = 1.0 6 and\n1.0 19 at 95GHz and 150GHz respectively), and the significance of detection. In the limit that clusters are point\nsources in the SPT data, the rms positional uncertainty\nis \u223c \u03b8FWHM /\u03be, where \u03b8FWHM is the beam width (Ivison etpal. 2007). For resolved clusters, the uncertainty\n2\nis \u223c \u03b8FWHM\n+ (k\u03b8c )2 /\u03be, where \u03b8c is the cluster core\nsize, and k is a factor of order unity Story et al. (2011);\nSong et al. (2012). For clusters such as those described\nin this work (with \u03be \u223c 8 and z \u223c 0.4), this uncertainty\nis estimated to be 1000 \u20131500 .\n2.2. SZ Mass Estimates\nIn this work, we use the mass estimates from R12. The\nSPT mass calibration and method to estimate cluster\nmasses from the SZ and X-ray data is described in detail in B11 and R12. In summary, a probability density\nfunction of each cluster's mass estimate was calculated at\neach point in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that\nvaried both the cluster scaling relations and cosmological\nparameters assuming a \u039bCDM cosmology and using the\nCMB+BAO+SNe+SPTCL data, where SPTCL denotes\nthe added cluster data set. In effect, this step is calculating the posterior probability given the measurement uncertainties and the expected distribution of galaxy cluster\nmasses for that specific cosmology and scaling relation.\nThe resulting masses are SZ plus X-ray posterior mass\nestimates where applicable; even for clusters without Xray data, the mass normalization from clusters with Xray data affects the SZ scaling relation parameters explored by the chain. The probability density functions\nfor different points in the chain are combined to obtain a\nmass estimate that has been fully marginalized over all\n\n3\n\ncosmological and scaling relation parameters. The final\nproducts are labeled M500,SZ here.\nThe uncertainty on M500,SZ is dominated by a \u223c 15%\nintrinsic scatter in the SZ-mass scaling relation, a \u223c 10%\nuncertainty due to the finite detection significance of the\ncluster in the SZ maps, and a \u223c 10% systematic uncertainty associated with the normalization of the SZ\u2013mass\nscaling relation. Together, these and other sources of uncertainty yield a \u223c 20% uncertainty on M500,SZ for each\ncluster.\n2.3. Spectroscopic Redshifts\nWe have targeted four of the clusters for multi-object\nspectroscopy observations, the details of which will appear in J. Ruel et al. (in preparation). In summary, we\nused GISMO (Gladders Image Slicing Multi-slit Option)\non IMACS (Inamori Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph; Dressler et al. 2003; Osip et al. 2008) at the\nMagellan Baade 6.5 m telescope in 2010 September and\nOctober. These observations used the f /4 camera, the\nz1 430 \u2212 675 filter, and the 300 lines mm\u22121 grating. Conditions were photometric and the seeing varied between\n0.00 5 and 0.00 9. Reduction of the raw spectra was done with\nthe COSMOS package35 (Carnegie Observatories System\nfor Multi-Object Spectroscopy); redshifts were measured\nby cross-correlation with the \"fabtemp97\" template in\nRVSAO (Radial Velocity Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory package, Kurtz & Mink 1998) and checked\nfor agreement with visually-identified features. Outliers\nwere rejected by iterative clipping at 3\u03c3. The redshift of\neach cluster was calculated using the robust biweight estimator (Beers et al. 1990) and the confidence interval by\nbootstrap resampling. These results are given in Table\n1.\nThe redshift of SPT-CL J2030-5638 is photometrically\nderived from the red sequence of cluster galaxies, the\ndetails of which are described by Song et al. (2012) and\nR12.\n3. WEAK LENSING DATA\n\nIn this section we describe the acquisition, reduction,\nand calibration of the images and photometry from which\nweak lensing masses are measured.\n3.1. Observations\nWe imaged through g 0 , r0 , and i0 passbands using\nMegacam on the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las\nCampanas Observatory, Chile (McLeod et al. 1998).\nMegacam was previously commissioned on the Multiple\nMirror Telescope, where it was used to study weak lensing by galaxy clusters in the northern hemisphere (Israel\net al. 2010, 2011). Megacam consists of a 9 \u00d7 4 CCD\narray producing a 250 \u00d7 250 field-of-view. We operated\nread-out in 2 \u00d7 2 binning mode for an effective pixel scale\nof 0.00 16. The r0 -band images are used for shape measurements (Section 4), and the added g 0 and i0 bands are used\nin concert with deep photometric-redshift catalogs from\nexternal surveys to prune and characterize the source\npopulation using magnitude and color information (Section 4.2).\nObservations of SPT-CL J0516-5430 occurred at the\nend of the nights of 2010 October 6 and 7.

(1989) where it was designated as AS0520. The\nspectroscopic redshift was measured to be zl = 0.2950 (Leccardi & Molendi\n2008).\nb Not known prior to R12.\nc A number of structures have been identified near this cluster by other authors.\nSee Section 7.2, R12, and Song et al. (2012) for discussions.\n\n1760 s of exposure time was obtained in the r0 -band using a 2 \u00d7 2 square dither pattern of 600 on a side, plus the\nsame 2 \u00d7 2 pattern executed about 2500 north and 5600\nwest, for a total of eight individual exposures of 220 s\neach. The two star guiders, situated on opposite sides\nof the Megacam focal plane, were simultaneously operational for every r0 -band exposure, which resulted in\nuniform and stable point-spread function (PSF) FWHM\npatterns across the entire field, as monitored upon readout during observation. Twelve hundred seconds of total\nexposure time was obtained in the g 0 -band, and 3600 s\nin the i0 -band, each with dithers that covered the chip\ngaps. Conditions were clear and stable with good seeing.\nThe rest of the clusters were observed over 3 secondhalf nights on 2011 May 31\u2013June 2. For each cluster, a\ntotal of 1800 s of exposure time was obtained in the r0 band using a three-point diagonal linear dither pattern\nthat covered the chip gaps. In the g 0 band, we obtained\n1200 s of exposures with the same three-point dither pattern, and in i0 we integrated for 2400 s using a five-point\ndiagonal linear dither pattern. Conditions in this run\nwere intermittently cloudy, resulting in approximately\n50% unsuitable time. Seeing was sub-arcsecond in the\nr0 -band for these four clusters.\nFor all five clusters, special care was taken to observe\nin the r0 -band in stable, good seeing conditions under the\nclearest available skies. We executed the dither patterns\nin immediate succession and monitored the seeing. The\nresult was . 15% variation in r0 -band seeing in all dithers\nfor any given cluster. Because of this and the uniform\nPSF pattern afforded by Clay and Megacam (Section 4),\nwe coadd images without homogenizing to a common\nPSF in any way.\n3.2. Image Reductions\n\nThe images are reduced at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) Telescope Data Center using the SAO Megacam reduction pipeline. The pipeline\n\nuses publicly available utilities from IRAF, SExtractor\n(Bertin & Arnouts 1996), and Swarp programs36 (Bertin\net al. 2002), as well as in-house routines.\nBasic CCD processing includes overscan correction,\ntrimming, and bad pixel removal. Cosmic rays are removed using L.A.Cosmic (van Dokkum 2001). Flat-field\nimages for each filter were generated from sets of twilight sky observations, taken during clear dawn or dusk\ntwilight, and then applied to the data.\nTo correct for any scattered light remaining after flatfielding, an illumination correction is also performed.\nThe illumination correction image for a given filter is\nmade by using 12 exposures from a dithered pattern designed to expose the same stars over the full span of the\nfocal plane. Where these data are not photometric, i.e.,\nthere is too much scatter in the residuals of the dithered\nexposures, we instead use just one exposure of the SDSS\nStripe 82 field and match to the catalog of Ivezi\u0107 et al.\n(2007).\nA fringe correction is performed for the i0 filter. We\nmake fringe-frames by combining large numbers of i0\nscience-field exposures.\nIn the final step, two passes are made of the world coordinate system (WCS). The first pass fits star positions\nto a reference catalog, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey\n(2MASS, Skrutskie et al. 2006) catalog. Once that is successfully done, the second pass computes the WCS relative to a source catalog made from a target exposure.\nAll exposures of the same target are fit relative to the\nsame reference, regardless of the filter used. Generally\nfor this study, the stars used in the final WCS solutions\nnumber in the two- to three-thousands, which provides\nastrometry accurate typically to 0.00 02 rms.\nThe final product of the SAO Megacam reduction\npipeline is the multi-extension file for each exposure. We\n36 SExtractor and Swarp are hosted at http://www.astromatic.\nnet/.\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\n\n5\n\nrun Swarp to mosaic and coadd exposures for each target and filter, weighting by the relative zeropoints of each\nframe.\n3.3. Photometry\n\nSExtractor is used to find sources in the images and\nperform photometry. We operate SExtractor in dualimage mode, with the r0 -band image serving as the detection image. In this mode, objects are detected in the\nr0 -band image while photometry is done in the g 0 , r0 ,\nor i0 -band image, and these final catalogs are joined to\nproduce a catalog of colors and magnitudes in the instrumental system. We use MAG_AUTO photometry. The\ncolors of stars and galaxies are then calibrated using Stellar Locus Regression (SLR, High et al. 2009). SLR calibrates colors by fitting the instrumental stellar locus to\nthat of \u223c 105 stars in the SDSS. Cross matching with the\n2MASS allows us to solve for the zeropoints of individual bands as well to produce calibrated magnitudes. The\nresulting photometry is effectively dereddened, as this is\nan inherent feature of the method, so we do not apply\nany additional Galactic extinction corrections.\nTransforming Clay-Megacam photometry to the SDSS\nsystem with SLR requires estimating color terms. We\nuse gri-band photometry of SPT-CL J0516-5430 on the\nSDSS photometric system, acquired with IMACS on\nMagellan Baade, operated in f /2 imaging mode. These\nIMACS data are used in the analysis of High et al. (2010),\nand are described in detail in that work. We cross-match\npoint sources with the IMACS catalogs, obtaining the\ncolor transformations\ngCMC \u2212 gSDSS = Cg + 0.100(g \u2212 i)SDSS\nrCMC \u2212 rSDSS = Cr \u2212 0.022(g \u2212 i)SDSS\niCMC \u2212 iSDSS = Ci \u2212 0.025(g \u2212 i)SDSS ,\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere zeropoints C are nuisance parameters left free in\nthe fit in addition to the slopes, and CMC denotes ClayMegacam37 . These measurements are illustrated in Figure 1. We chose the multiplier g \u2212 i because it gives\nmaximal leverage on the color-term measurement over\nthe full range of stellar temperatures, and thus over the\ncatalog's color space.\nThe systematic uncertainty of the color calibration is\nestimated at 0.01 mag to 0.03 mag in g \u2212 r and r \u2212 i,\nlikely dominated by the non-uniformity of Galactic extinction, flat-fielding, and details of the photometry (see\nHigh et al. 2009). Magnitude calibrations are uncertain\nat \u223c 0.05 mag in all bands, dominated by the overall accuracy of the 2MASS point-source catalog. These levels\nof uncertainty are sufficient for our purposes.\nTable 2 lists the basic imaging information for the five\nclusters. Depths are estimated from the median magnitude of sources whose signal-to-noise ratio is 5. Seeing is\nestimated in the WL band, r0 .\nWe test the effect of photometric zeropoint errors on\nthe final WL-SZ mass ratios. Systematic errors in photometry enter into the mass analysis through the estimation of the critical surface density for each cluster (Section 4.2). We estimate this quantity using publicly available photometric redshift catalogs of external fields, to\n37 We emphasize that g\n0\nCMC \u2261 g and gSDSS \u2261 g in this work,\nand so forth for the other bands.\n\nFig. 1.- Clay-Megacam color-term measurement.

We test the effect of photometric error, \u03b4i , by cutting the standard photo-z catalogs\nat iCFHT > 24 \u2212 \u03b4i and repeating the full analysis. The\n\n\f6\n\nF. W. High et al.\n\nlevel of photometric accuracy estimated here (5%) causes\nchanges in the WL-SZ mass ratios at the sub-percent\nlevel, which is significantly subdominant to the statistical uncertainty and the largest systematic uncertainties.\n4. CREATING SHEAR CATALOGS\n\nIn this section, we summarize the standard theoretical framework on which WL mass measurements rest,\nincluding the two primary quantities that must be estimated from data: the critical surface density and the\nreduced shear.\n4.1. Tangential Shear\nWeak gravitational lensing of extended sources by\nspherically symmetric mass overdensities induces a mean\nshear in a direction oriented tangentially to the center of\nmass. Tangential shear, \u03b3+ , is calculated from the Cartesian components of shear, (\u03b31 , \u03b32 ), as\n\n\u03b3+ = \u2212\u03b31 cos(2\u03c6) \u2212 \u03b32 sin(2\u03c6)\n\n(4)\n\n(see for example Mellier 1999, Section 2, for an overview\nof WL shear). Indices i \u2208 {1, 2} correspond to horizontal\nand vertical image coordinates. Here, \u03b31 is the component along the horizontal axis (position angle \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 )\nand \u03b32 is the shear at position angle \u03c6 = 45\u25e6 . Cross\nshear is calculated as\n\u03b3\u00d7 = \u2212\u03b31 sin(2\u03c6) + \u03b32 cos(2\u03c6);\n\n(5)\n\n\u25e6\n\nthis is the shear component oriented at 45 with respect\nto \u03b3+ . The azimuthally averaged cross shear h\u03b3\u00d7 i as\na function of radius provides a diagnostic for residual\nsystematics, because no astrophysical effects, including\nlensing, produce such a signal. As a consequence, a nonzero h\u03b3\u00d7 i indicates the presence of some types of residual\nsystematic error, though we note that this is not an exhaustive test.\nThe mean tangential shear as a function of radial distance in the plane of the sky at the cluster redshift, R,\ndepends on the projected surface density, \u03a3(R), as\nh\u03b3+ i(R) =\n\nh\u03a3i(< R) \u2212 \u03a3(R)\n\u03a3crit\n\n(6)\n\n(Miralda-Escude 1995). This depends on the critical surface density,\nc2 1\n\u03a3crit =\n,\n(7)\n4\u03c0G Dl \u03b2\nwhere c is the speed of light, G is the gravitational constant, and \u03b2 \u2261 Dls /Ds is the lensing efficiency. Quantities D are angular-diameter distances, and l indicates\nthe lens (the cluster) while s indicates sources.\nThe observable quantity is not the shear but the reduced shear, g, which relates to the shear as\n\u03b3 = (1 \u2212 \u03ba)g\n\n(8)\n\nvia the convergence, \u03ba = \u03a3/\u03a3crit . Estimating true shear\ntherefore requires estimating convergence, which we perform in radial bins, as discussed in Section 5.1.\nThe two key quantities in measuring mass from WL\ndata are thus the critical surface density and the reduced\nshear. We describe these two steps in the following sections.\n\n4.2. Cluster-galaxy Decontamination and Critical\n\nSurface Density Estimation\nCalculating WL masses requires estimating the critical surface density (Equation (7)), which is a geometric quantity containing ratios of angular diameter distances between the observer, the lens, and sources. This\nrequires redshift information for the lens and sources.\nThree bands are not sufficient for estimating source\nredshifts in the Clay-Megacam data themselves, so we\nrely on photometric redshift catalogs of other, nonoverlapping surveys that have integrated to equal or\ngreater depths, under the assumption that the mean underlying galaxy population is the same everywhere in the\nsky. The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) Deep field catalogs are sufficient for this\npurpose (Coupon et al. 2009). For the \u03a3crit estimate from\nthe photo-z catalog to accurately reflect the population\nin the Clay-Megacam images on average, cluster galaxies\nmust be removed from the Clay-Megacam catalogs.\nWe remove cluster galaxies from the shear catalogs using the same CFHTLS catalogs as a guide. We first\nplot the density of galaxies at 19 < iCFHT < 25 in the\nCFHTLS-Deep catalogs in (g \u2212r, r \u2212i) color\u2013color space.\nGalaxies with photometric redshifts of |zphot \u2212zl | < 0.05,\ni.e., near the cluster redshift, are considered contaminants or \"non-sources\", and all other galaxies are considered \"sources\". The densities of these two populations\nare shown in Figure 2. We then define a simple polygon\nthat encloses the majority of the non-source galaxies.\nBecause the clusters are at different redshifts, the location and shape of this polygon is a function of zl\nin general. Rather than defining five different polygons, we only define two: one that excises cluster galaxies for 0.28 < zl < 0.35 (two clusters), and one for\n0.35 < zl < 0.43 (three clusters). Figure 3 shows the\nphotometric redshift distribution after removing galaxies within the high-zl polygon. We test the contamination after cuts by using these polygons to remove galaxies from the CFHTLS-Deep catalogs, and measuring the\nfraction of galaxies with photometric redshifts satisfying\n|zphot \u2212 zl | < 0.05. Under this test, the fraction of contaminants is < 0.1% for all cluster redshifts considered\nhere.\nAfter transforming the Clay-Megacam catalogs to the\nCFHT-Megacam photometric system using color terms\n(Regnault et al. 2009), we apply the same magnitude\nand color cuts to the Clay-Megacam catalogs. The radial\ndistribution of catalog galaxies before and after the color\ncuts is shown in Figure 4 for a representative cluster.\nThis procedure removes most of the radially decreasing\ntrend of galaxy densities such that the final galaxy surface density is uncorrelated with radius. This constitutes\nsome empirical evidence that the procedure is removing\ncluster galaxies. Some residual surface density trend with\nradius may be expected due to WL magnification (e.g.\nBartelmann & Schneider 2001). We measure the slope of\nd log N/dm of selected sources to be \u223c 0.4 in our data,\nso the effect would be small.\nWe estimate h\u03b2i and h\u03b2 2 i from the photo-z distribution in the CFHTLS-Deep catalogs after these selections\nare made (Figure 3). The \u03b2 distribution is expected to\nvary between fields, both in the CFHTLS Deep fields\nand the SPT cluster fields, due to finite galaxy counts\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\n\n7\n\nFig. 2.- Color\u2013color distribution of 19 < iCFHT < 25 galaxies in the CFHTLS-Deep photometric redshift catalog.

The gray polygon delineates source/non-source\nregions. The yellow circle shows the typical color of a luminous red galaxy at the cluster redshift (Lopes 2007). The remaining panels show\none-dimensional histograms of projections of these colors. These panels illustrate that one-dimensional color cuts are a less efficient way of\nremoving contaminant galaxies.\n\nand cosmic variance. We estimate the uncertainty this\ninduces in the mean mass ratio results by repeating the\nentire analysis using each CFHTLS Deep field individually, and averaging the results. The uncertainties on\nresulting WL to SZ mass ratios are < 2%, a level that is\nsubdominant to the overall statistical uncertainties and\nother systematics. We adopt the mean values of h\u03b2i and\nh\u03b2 2 i over the four CFHTLS Deep fields in the baseline\nanalysis. These are reported in Table 3.\nWe perform consistency checks on the WL mass analysis by modifying this photometric selection procedure\nin two ways. First, we test defining color\u2013color polygons that remove the vast majority of objects at zphot <\nzl + 0.1, i.e., both near and in front of the cluster. This\nsignificantly widens the area covered by the polygon, and\nthe effect is that a large number of galaxies that are\n\nin fact behind the cluster are eliminated as well. This\nroughly halves ngal and does not change h\u03b2i estimates\nsignificantly. The WL-SZ ratios are consistent with unity\nand with the baseline result under this test.\nSecond, we test using limits of iCFHT = 24.5 and 24,\nwhich are brighter than our baseline limit of iCFHT = 25.\nThe effect is to probe a brighter mean population of\ngalaxies in the catalogs, which causes h\u03b2i and ngal to\nboth take smaller values. This increases the statistical\nuncertainty of the WL masses, but restricts the catalogs\nto magnitude regimes in which the CFHTLS-Deep photometric redshift catalogs have been explicitly tested and\nverified (Coupon et al. 2009). The resulting WL-SZ aperture mass ratios in both cases are statistically consistent\nwith the baseline result, and with unity.\n\n\f8\n\nF. W.

To estimate reduced\nshear in the r0 -band images we employ the method of\nKaiser, Squires, & Broadhurst (1995, hereafter KSB)\nand Luppino & Kaiser (1997), with the modifications\nof Hoekstra et al. (1998). This method bases shear measurements on Gaussian-weighted second-order image moments,\nZ\n\nIij =\n\nd2 ~xxi xj W (~x)f (~x),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere W is the Gaussian function, f is the object image,\nand the origin of the coordinate system has been iteratively determined from the first-order moment using the\nsame weight. Variables xi (i \u2208 {1, 2}) indicate vertical\nand horizontal image coordinates. The polarization is a\nspin 2 pseudo-vector e\u03b1 (\u03b1 \u2208 {1, 2}), where\ne1 =\n\nI11 \u2212 I22\nI11 + I22\n\nand e2 =\n\n2I12\n.\nI11 + I22\n\n(10)\n\nFig. 4.- Radial distribution of galaxies in the Clay-Megacam\ncatalog of cluster SPT-CL J2022-6323, before and after making the\ncolor cuts described in Section 4.2. These data are representative\nof all clusters. The color cuts reduce the clustering signal such\nthat the final catalog used in the weak lensing analysis is roughly\nflat. WL masses are computed outside the shaded region, from \u03b81\n(vertical dashed line) to \u03b82 = 120 .\n\nThe magnitude of the polarization is e = (e21 + e22 )1/2 .\nThe resulting polarizations must be corrected for the\neffects of the anisotropic smearing by the PSF. To this\nend, we fit fourth order polynomials to the stellar Piish\nand Piism (the diagonal entries of the shear- and smearpolarizability tensors, see KSB) and remove outliers. To\nthe surviving objects we fit a fourth order polynomial to\nboth e1 and e2 . We do this for a range of weight functions, which is necessary for computing the pre-seeing\nshear polarizability P \u03b3 (see Hoekstra et al. 1998). The\nrms of the residuals for each polarization component after the fourth order fit are < 0.005 for all clusters. These\nare small compared to the magnitude of signals we are\nseeking, which are about 0.01 to 0.1. While residuals\nof this size can in principle lead to large shear bias for\nany given faint galaxy locally, we expect this effect to\nbe zero on average in the radial bins because the spatial\nresidual pattern is consistent with noise. A representative example PSF polarization plot is shown in Figure\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\n5. This model is used to correct for PSF anisotropy using the procedure described in the original works (KSB;\nHoekstra et al. 1998).\nThe next step is to account for the seeing, which lowers\nthe observed shear signal. This is done by rescaling the\npolarizations to their \"true\" values by P \u03b3 (Luppino &\nKaiser 1997; Hoekstra et al. 1998). The measurements\nof P \u03b3 for individual galaxies are too noisy, and instead\nwe bin the measurements in galaxy size and use this to\ncompute the value as a function of size. The reduced\nshear g is then estimated as\ngi = ei /P \u03b3 .\n\n(11)\n\nThis implementation of the KSB shear analysis pipeline\nis described in more detail in previous works (Hoekstra\net al. 1998, 2000). It was subject to blind tests by the\nShear Testing Program (Heymans et al. 2006; Massey\net al. 2007), wherein it achieved accuracy at the 0.02\u03b3\nlevel under low PSF anisotropies, such as Clay-Megacam\nexhibits. This level of bias induces mass errors that are\nsubdominant to the statistical and systematic uncertainties.\n5. WEAK-LENSING MASS MEASUREMENT\n\nIn this section we discuss how we estimate mass from\nthe shear catalogs. We employ two types of WL mass\nestimators, both of which make use of the same, azimuthally averaged shear profiles. We test the accuracy\nof our algorithms using ray-traced N -body simulations,\nand we also describe the WL convergence field reconstruction procedure.\n5.1. Shear Profiles and Corrections\n\nWe compute binned shear profiles using a weighted average in each radial bin. The weight for each galaxy is\nw=\n\n1\nP\u03b32\n=\n,\n\u03c3g2\n\u03c3\u03b32 P \u03b3 2 + h\u2206e2 i\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03b3 is the scatter in shear due to the intrinsic ellipticity of the galaxies (set to 0.3; see for example Leauthaud et al. 2007) and h\u2206e2 i is the error estimate for the\npolarization (Hoekstra et al. 2000). The weighted mean\nfor i \u2208 {+, \u00d7} is then\nP\nn wn \u03b3i,n\nh\u03b3i i = P\n,\n(13)\nn wn\nand errors on the mean, \u03c3h\u03b3i i , are computed via\n1\n2\n\u03c3h\u03b3\nii\n\n=\n\nX\n\nwn .\n\n(14)\n\nn\n\nTwo corrections are applied to the binned shear data.\nThe first correction accounts for a known error in the\nbinned shear data due to the averaging operation. Seitz\n& Schneider (1997) show that estimating the critical surface density of each cluster using the mean of the \u03b2 distribution in redshift catalogs induces an error in the observed reduced-shear, which can be corrected to first order using\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nhgobs i\nh\u03b2 i\n=1+\n\u2212\n1\n\u03ba.\n(15)\nhgtrue i\nh\u03b2i2\n\n9\n\nWe adopt the model for \u03ba described below to make this\ncorrection.\nThe second correction is to transform the reduced shear\ng to shear \u03b3 by estimating the \u03ba in each bin. We accomplish this by jointly fitting for the shear and the convergence profiles to those predicted by Navarro, Frenk, &\nWhite (1997, hereafter NFW) density profiles assuming\nDuffy et al. (2008, hereafter D08) concentration\u2013mass\u2013\nredshift scaling, wherein the SZ-derived mass is used as\nthe input. The NFW family of density profiles take the\nform\n\u03b4c \u03c1crit\n\u03c1(r) =\n,\n(16)\n(rc/r200 )(1 + rc/r200 )2\nwhere r is the three-dimensional radial distance, r200 is\nthe radius at which the mean NFW overdensity is 200\ntimes \u03c1crit at the cluster redshift, c is concentration, and\n\u03b4c =\n\n200\nc2\n.\n3 ln(1 + c) \u2212 c/(1 + c)\n\n(17)\n\nThis fitting procedure results in estimates of the \u03b3 profile under the assumption of D08 concentrations, and it\nalso yields the convergence profile used to perform the\nredshift distribution correction in Equation 15 as well as\ntotal spherical masses in our main results.\nObserved shear profiles, after all of these corrections\nare applied, are presented in the Appendix. The cross\nshear is consistent with zero, as expected for a signal\nthat is not appreciably contaminated by systematics.\n5.2. Aperture Masses\n\nOne of the advantages of the tangential shear is that\nit can be used to directly constrain the projected mass\nwithin an aperture. Aperture masses are integrals\nover the shear data multiplied by a filter (see Fahlman\net al. 1994; Schneider 1996). These aperture masses are\nparameter-free in the sense that the observable quantity\ngives cylindrical mass constraints without reference to\nanalytic density profiles. If the filter is compensated,\nthey are also insensitive to the mass-sheet degeneracy.\nThe classical \u03b6-statistic for circular apertures, which uses\na particular choice of filter, is38\n\u03b6(\u03b81 ) = h\u03bai<\u03b81 \u2212 h\u03bai\u03b81 <\u03b8<\u03b82\nZ \u03b82\nh\u03b3+ i(\u03b8)\n2\nd\u03b8\n=\n2\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03b81 /\u03b82 \u03b81\n\u03b8\n\n(18)\n\n(Fahlman et al. 1994; Kaiser 1995). The aperture mass\nis then\nMap (\u03b81 ) = \u03c0(\u03b81 Dl )2 \u03a3crit \u03b6(\u03b81 ).\n(19)\nThe square of the measurement uncertainty of the aperture mass statistic takes an analytic form,\n\u00132 Z \u03b82\n\u0012\n2\n\u03c3h\u03b3\n2\n+i\n2\n\u03c3stat\n(\u03b81 ) =\nd\u03b8\n,\n(20)\n1 \u2212 \u03b812 /\u03b822\n\u03b82\n\u03b81\nwhere \u03c3h\u03b3+ i is given in Equation (14). In addition\nto the measurement uncertainty, LSS along the line of\nsight contributes a random uncertainty to the WL aperture masses, which we add to the formal statistical WL\n38 This \u03b6 statistic is in general a function of two angles, \u03b8 and\n1\n\u03b82 , but we fix \u03b82 for all analyses and so have simplified the notation.\n\n\f10\n\nF.

Residuals between the data\nand the model are < 0.005 rms for all clusters.\n\nmass uncertainties in quadrature using the prescription\nof Hoekstra et al. (2011). LSS uncertainties are 15% to\n20% for these clusters.\nWe fix \u03b82 to 120 for all analyses, which is roughly the\nmaximum radius of the Megacam imaging. We set \u03b81 to\nR500,SZ /Dl .\nAperture masses provide lower limits on total cylindrical masses within \u03b81 . In the limit of \u03b82 \u2192 \u221e, the aperture mass converges to true integrated cylindrical mass\nwithin \u03b81 , but real data extend to finite radius, so \u03b82 must\nbe finite. Direct comparisons of the observed aperture\nmass to other spherical or cylindrical mass-observables\ntherefore requires care.\n5.3. Spherical- to Aperture-mass Transformations\nSome extra computation makes direct comparisons between aperture masses and spherical masses possible.\nThis is accomplished by assuming an analytic threedimensional profile consistent with a given spherical mass\nestimate, projecting it to two dimensions, calculating the\nshear assuming some \u03a3crit , and then computing the aperture mass statistic given this predicted shear.\nTo illustrate this procedure concretely, say we are\ngiven some spherical mass estimate, M\u2206,obs , derived\nfrom another observable such as the SZ effect. We\nwish to compare this to the WL aperture mass at\nthe same radius, Map,WL (R\u2206,obs ), where R\u2206,obs =\n[3M\u2206,obs /(\u22064\u03c0\u03c1crit (zl ))]1/3 . We first assume a threedimensional NFW profile, with total spherical mass\nwithin R\u2206,obs equal to M\u2206,obs , and concentration c taken\nfrom the mean of clusters of these masses and redshifts\naccording to the D08 c\u2013M \u2013z scaling relation. The corresponding two-dimensional projection of this profile and\npredicted shear take an analytic form (Wright & Brainerd 2000). We use the same \u03a3crit as used in the WL\nanalysis. Then, from this shear we compute \u03b6, again\nusing the same filter as used on the WL data. Specifically, the outer radius, \u03b82 = 120 , has been set by the\nsize of the Megacam imaging footprint, and the inner ra-\n\ndius is \u03b81 = R\u2206,obs /Dl . The result, Map,obs (R\u2206,obs ),\nis the aperture-equivalent mass of M\u2206,obs , which was\ndetermined by some other method or observable. It is\nthe direct analog of the WL aperture mass measured at\nthe same radius, Map,WL (R\u2206,obs ), such that the ratio of\nthe WL to this aperture-equivalent quantity is unity in\nthe absence of other systematic errors. We perform this\ntransformation on SZ mass estimates to test for statistical consistency with the WL aperture masses.\nWe propagate spherical mass uncertainties to aperture mass equivalent by computing the aperture mass\nof M\u2206,obs \u00b1 \u03c3M numerically using the same procedure. As illustration, aperture mass uncertainties are\n\u223c (0.54, 0.67, 0.81) times the values of their spherical\nNFW counterparts for c = (1, 3, 10) at these clusters'\ntypical R500 radii.\n5.4. Calibration Tests with Mock Catalogs\n\nA number of recent works have shown using N -body\nsimulations that WL derived mass estimates are biased\nat roughly the \u22125% to \u221210% level (Becker & Kravtsov\n2011; Bah\u00e9 et al. 2012; Rasia et al. 2012). We perform similar calibration tests of the WL mass statistics presented in our work using mock shear catalogs of\n220 deg2 of sky. The catalogs are drawn from an N -body\ndark matter simulation of a standard \u039bCDM universe.\nThe dark matter halos are populated with galaxies using\nADDGALS such that they reproduce known luminosity, color, and clustering relations (Wechsler 2004, R. H.\nWechsler et al., in preparation). Shears are assigned to\neach galaxy by raytracing through the N -body simulation39 .\nWe compute the masses of 280 N -body halos at redshifts 0.25 < z < 0.45 with masses M200 \u2265 1014 h\u22121\n70 M .\nTo reflect the choices we have made in analyzing the\nClay-Megacam data, we only use shear profiles between\n39 The simulated shear catalogs were kindly made available to\nuse by R.

Becker.\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\nR500 and 120 , where R500 is extrapolated using the D08\nconcentration\u2013mass\u2013redshift scaling relation with M200\ndetermined from the N -body halo finder as the input. In\norder to minimize statistical uncertainty in these tests,\nwe use perfect knowledge of the shear field at the galaxy\nlocations (i.e., we do not include intrinsic shape noise)\nas well as perfect source redshifts, and we select source\ngalaxies as those at |z \u2212 zl | > 0.05. The resulting bias\nbetween measured masses and appropriately transformed\nN -body masses, averaged over the sample, ranges from\n\u22126% to \u221213%, consistent in magnitude and sign with\nthe previous works. These tests carry a statistical uncertainty of about 2%. The precise bias values are reported\nin Section 6.2. We do not apply these bias corrections to\nany mass estimates presented in this work.\n5.5. Convergence Field Reconstruction\n\nWe reconstruct the convergence field in two dimensions\nusing the method of Kaiser & Squires (1993). The purpose is to test the impact of using the peak of the reconstructed \u03ba field as the cluster center when computing\nshear profiles. The convergence is estimated up to a constant as a sum over galaxies n,\n1 X\n\u03ba(~x0 ) = \u2212\n\u03c7\u03b1 (~xn \u2212 ~x0 )2e\u03b1 /P \u03b3 ,\n(21)\nngal \u03c0 n\nwhere ngal is the mean surface density of source galaxies\nand \u03c7\u03b1 = {x2 \u2212 y 2 , 2xy}/\u03b84 and \u03b8 = (x2 + y 2 )1/2 . The\nconstant is set such that the mean convergence across\nthe full field is zero. The wide field-of-view of the observations allows us to avoid artifacts from this method\nwhich have caused problems in the past.\nWe pixelate the convergence maps at 0.0 4 pixel\u22121 . The\nerrors per pixel\np are independent, and are computed\nas \u03c3pix \u2248 \u03c3\u03ba / ngal 0.0 42 , where \u03c3\u03ba \u223c \u03c3\u03b3 \u223c 0.3 and\nngal is measured from the data and assigned units of\narcmin\u22122 . We then smooth the map with a Gaussian\nof size \u03c3smooth = 30 . The peak in the smoothed convergence field, max(\u03ba), is identified as the maximum\nvalue across the entire smoothed map. The signalto-noise ratio p\nin the smoothed peak value is S/N =\nmax(\u03ba)/(\u03c3pix / 2\u03c0\u03c3smooth /0.0 4). The uncertainty on\nthe peak position\u221a is then FWHMsmooth /(S/N ), where\nFWHMsmooth = 8 ln 2 \u03c3smooth . This is equal to \u223c 4500\nfor all five clusters. Using the convergence field peaks as\nthe cluster centers gives a mean ratio of WL-SZ masses\nthat is consistent with unity and with the baseline result\nto within the statistical uncertainty.\n6. RESULTS\n\nWe report WL-derived masses, then test the overall\naccuracy of the SZ mass determination of R12 by measuring the mean ratio of equivalent WL and SZ mass\nestimators. In the baseline analysis we\n\u2022 select source galaxies at 19 < iCFHT < 25 with\ncolors exterior to the polygon shown in Section 4.2,\n\u2022 use concentrations of D08, and\n\u2022 use SZ centroid as the cluster centers.\n\n11\n\nWe then alter various steps in the analysis in order to\ntest the robustness of the result, as well as to estimate\nthe magnitude of various potential sources of error. Shear\nprofiles and aperture mass profiles are presented in the\nAppendix, in addition to optical, SZ, and convergence\nmaps.\n6.1. Masses and Mass Ratios\n\nIn this section we use three different methods for estimating mass from these data. In all cases, we only use\nshear data at R500,SZ /Dl < \u03b8 < 120 .\nIn the first method, we measure aperture masses with\n\u03b81 = R500,SZ /Dl and \u03b82 = 120 . Following the procedure\noutlined in Section 5.3, we derive the equivalent estimator from the SZ masses by assigning an NFW profile consistent with M500,SZ , computing the predicted shear for\nsuch a profile, and then calculating the aperture mass\nfrom the predicted profile over the same radii. These\nmasses are inherently projected, two-dimensional quantities. We plot the results in the top panel of Figure\n6.\nIn the second method, we estimate the spherical\nmass by fitting NFW profiles to binned shear data\nat R500,SZ /Dl < \u03b8 < 120 and computing the total\nmass of the best fit profile at R500,SZ . We label this\nMNFW,WL (R500,SZ ). The results are to be compared to\nM500,SZ directly. Because of the use of a radius from an\nexternal source, the radius at which the mass is quoted\nis not the radius where \u2206 = 500 (the overdensity factor\nwith respect to the cosmological critical density) in the\nbest-fit NFW model. These masses are plotted in the\nbottom panel of Figure 6.\nAnd in the third method, we use the same best-fit\nprofiles above to estimate the spherical mass within the\nradius where \u2206 = 500 as determined from the best-fit\nmodel itself, i.e., M500,WL . This is also to be compared\nto M500,SZ directly. These masses are plotted in Figure\n7.\nThe expectation of the ratio of WL to SZ masses is\nunity for all of these methods in the absence of systematic errors from, for example, the concentration and\ncluster centering assumptions. We note that we use a\nconcentration\u2013mass\u2013redshift scaling relation in all ratio\ntests: for the aperture mass comparison, it is only used\nto transform the SZ-derived mass to an aperture mass\nequivalent, whereas for both spherical mass comparisons\nit is only used in the WL shear profile fit.\nThe mass results and derived quantities are reported\nin Table 4.\nThe mean ratios of the three WL to SZ mass statistics are summarized in Table 5. In all cases we report\nweighted mean values, where, for each cluster n, weights\n1/\u03c3n2 are a combination of the WL aperture mass statistical uncertainty (including the estimated LSS contribution, which is between 15% and 20% for these clusters)\nand the total SZ mass uncertainties from R12 propagated\nto the derived quantity when necessary.\nP The uncertainty\non the mean is computed via 1/\u03c3 2 = n 1/\u03c3n2 .\nWe note that this method does not take into account\nany correlated uncertainty between clusters. The SZ\nmass estimates from R12 have been marginalized over\ncosmological and scaling relation parameters, and this\nresults in a \u223c 10% systematic uncertainty that is highly\ncorrelated between clusters. We have checked for the ef-\n\n\f12\n\nF. W. High et al.\n\nFig. 6.- Top: weak-lensing aperture masses vs. inferred aperture masses from Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich effect data. The one-to-one line is\nalso shown. Bottom: spherical WL masses vs spherical SZ masses. The WL masses are determined by fitting NFW profiles to weak lensing\nshear data at R500,SZ /Dl < \u03b8 < 120 and evaluating the resulting NFW mass profile at R500,SZ .\n\nfect of these correlations. Briefly, we adopt a Gaussian\nlikelihood for both the SZ and WL mass statistics and introduce nuisance parameters representing the true mass\nof each cluster. We introduce an additional free parameter representing an overall scaling of the SZ mass estimates. We then explore the resulting likelihood surface\nusing an MCMC. If we use a diagonal covariance matrix\nwith the uncertainties given in Table 4, we recover the\nnominal mean ratios of WL to SZ mass statistics of Table 5 at the maximum likelihood points in the chains. If\n\nwe use the covariance matrix for the five clusters as estimated from the R12 cosmological chains, we find that the\nincrease in the uncertainty on the mean ratios is small\n(\u223c 10% of the baseline ratio uncertainty values) when\ncompared to when we set these correlations to zero. As\ndiscussed in Section 6.2, WL systematic uncertainties are\nestimated to be significantly smaller than the statistical\ncomponents, so we only use a diagonal WL covariance\nmatrix. Thus, we ignore the correlated component to\nthe SZ and WL cluster mass estimate uncertainties for\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\n\n13\n\nTABLE 4\nCluster mass results\nCluster Name\nSPT-CL\nSPT-CL\nSPT-CL\nSPT-CL\nSPT-CL\n\nR500,SZ\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n\nMap,WL (R500,SZ )\n(1014 h\u22121 M )\n\nMap,SZ (R500,SZ )\n(1014 h\u22121 M )\n\nMNFW,WL (R500,SZ )\n(1014 h\u22121 M )\n\nM500,WL\n(1014 h\u22121 M )\n\nM500,SZ\n(1014 h\u22121 M )\n\n0.84\n0.69\n0.64\n0.77\n0.77\n\n4.70 \u00b1 1.49\n3.03 \u00b1 1.64\n2.62 \u00b1 1.43\n6.62 \u00b1 1.66\n5.21 \u00b1 1.88\n\n5.31 \u00b1 0.60\n3.42 \u00b1 0.41\n2.87 \u00b1 0.39\n3.99 \u00b1 0.47\n4.99 \u00b1 0.52\n\n4.43 \u00b1 1.16\n3.08 \u00b1 1.12\n1.93 \u00b1 0.82\n5.75 \u00b1 1.43\n4.37 \u00b1 1.29\n\n4.35 \u00b1 1.57\n3.27 \u00b1 1.64\n1.77 \u00b1 1.15\n7.71 \u00b1 2.23\n4.57 \u00b1 1.87\n\n4.60 \u00b1 0.90\n2.75 \u00b1 0.60\n2.28 \u00b1 0.57\n3.40 \u00b1 0.70\n4.03 \u00b1 0.78\n\nJ0516-5430\nJ2022-6323\nJ2030-5638\nJ2032-5627\nJ2135-5726\n\nNote. - Results from the WL measurements, as well SZ data and derived quantities.

We do\nnot estimate intrinsic scatter because this requires an\nestimate of the level of correlation in intrinsic scatter\nbetween the WL and SZ mass-observables. Estimating\nthese quantities is beyond the scope of this work (see\nSection 7.1 for further discussion).\nWe have performed additional consistency tests by using brighter iCFHT magnitude limits, and by adopting\nmore conservative color cuts. The brighter magnitude\nlimits are meant to probe the CFHTLS-Deep catalogs at\nmagnitudes where the photo-z accuracy has been explicitly verified and stated (Coupon et al. 2009). Results of\nthese tests are also reported in Table 5. For all tests we\nhave performed, mean ratios are statistically consistent\nwith unity and with the baseline result to within 1\u03c3.\n6.2. Systematic Error Analysis\nWe have explored various potential sources of systematic error, as discussed throughout the text, and we report the effects on the mean WL-SZ mass ratios in Table\n6 for the dominant or most interesting cases. Changes in\nmean ratios are quoted relative to the baseline results of\nthe aperture mass and spherical mass comparisons (Ta-\n\nble 5).\nOur first tests are to measure the effect that the assumed concentration scaling relation has on the mean\nratios. Our baseline analysis uses that of D08, which\ngives 3.0 \u2264 c \u2264 3.2 for these five clusters. The work\nof Macci\u00f2 et al. (2008) give 4.2 \u2264 c \u2264 4.5 and Neto\net al. (2007) give 3.8 \u2264 c \u2264 4.1. Prada et al. (2011) find\nconcentration values higher than these other works, with\n50th percentile values of c \u2248 5.0 and 90th percentile values of c \u2248 7.1. The latter represents the most extreme\nconcentrations we might expect for this sample, while the\nD08 gives the lowest expected values. This range of concentrations change the aperture mass ratios by 2% to 6%.\nSpherical mass ratios using NFW fits to WL data evaluated at R500,SZ change by 3% to 9%, and those evaluated\nat R500,WL change by 4% to 11%. This level of uncertainty is less than our statistical uncertainty on the mass\nratio for the five clusters, but it is the dominant source\nof systematic uncertainty in this work.\nWhile we use the SZ positions as the cluster centers\nin the baseline analyses, we also test using two other\ndefinitions of the cluster center: (1) the BCG and (2)\nthe peak in the WL-reconstructed \u03ba field.

The WL\nmasses are determined by fitting NFW profiles to weak lensing\nshear data at R500,SZ /Dl < \u03b8 < 120 and evaluating the resulting NFW mass profile at R500,WL as determined from the best-fit\nprofile itself.\n\ncally . 3000 from the SZ centroid, with the exception\nof SPT-CL J2032-5627, which is nearly 20 away. Mean\nratio results using the BCG as the cluster center are in\nnear perfect agreement with those using the SZ positions.\nHowever, adoption of the \u03ba peak location as the cluster\ncenter reduces the mean ratios of aperture masses and\nspherical masses by significantly greater amounts. The \u03ba\npeak locations have statistical uncertainties of \u223c 3000 to\n6000 , which are the largest uncertainties of the three center choices we have considered. While the mean ratios\n\nusing \u03ba peak locations are statistically consistent with\nunity and with the baseline results, this represents the\nlargest deviation from the baseline. This is probably because of noise in centering due to the large statistical\nuncertainties in determining convergence field peak locations; indeed, the universal reduction in the ratio values\nusing these centers provides some evidence that the convergence peaks are poorer estimators of cluster centers\nthan the SZ and BCG positions given the data, as centering errors suppress shear profiles, particularly in the\ninner regions (George et al. 2012).\nTests using N -body simulations (Section 5.4) result in\nthe calibration bias levels reported in Table 6. The statistical uncertainties of these calibration bias estimates\nare each 2%. We have not applied these bias corrections\nto any individual mass estimates nor to any mean mass\nratio statistics presented in this work. We note that such\nbias corrections increase tension with the mean mass ratio expectation of unity by up to 1\u03c3 at most.\nThe effects of other known sources of systematic uncertainty are smaller than those of concentration. The\nshear measurement method is estimated to be accurate\nto 0.02\u03b3 in shear (Section 4), which translates to \u2264 2% in\nthe mean aperture mass ratio and \u2264 3% in mean spherical mass ratios.\nThe source redshift distribution inferred from the four\ndifferent CFHTLS Deep fields (Section 4.2) is expected\nto vary due to finite galaxy counts and cosmic variance.\nThe source redshift distribution in the SPT cluster fields\nwe have observed is also expected to vary across fields in\nthe same way. We estimate the uncertainty this induces\nin the mean ratio results by repeating the entire analysis\nusing each CFHTLS Deep field individually and averaging the results. Under the assumption of randomness,\nthe mean aperture mass ratio carries an uncertainty from\nfinite galaxy counts and cosmic variance of \u00b11.1%, while\nthe mean spherical mass ratios are affected at \u00b11.0%\n(using R500,SZ ) and \u00b11.6% (using R500,WL ). This uncertainty can in principle be reduced further by using\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\nstandard photo-z catalogs of additional, disparate fields,\nor by measuring photo-z's directly in the SPT cluster\nfields, but this is not necessary given the data, as it is\nsignificantly subdominant to other uncertainties.\nBias and uncertainty from assumed cosmological parameters are also subdominant. We have assumed cosmological parameter values that are slightly different\nfrom the results of R12 (combining the 100 high purity\nSPT detected clusters with the CMB+BAO+H0 +SNe\ndata).\nTo estimate the bias and scatter this induces, we have tested marginalizing the WL to SZ\nmass ratios over the R12 \u039bCDM chains that combine\nCMB+BAO+H0 +SNe+SPTCL data. The results are\nthat both the bias and statistical uncertainty due to\ncosmology are sub-percent in the mass ratio statistics,\nand are therefore significantly below those expected from\nother sources of potential error.\nIn summary, no potential sources of systematic error\nthat we have explored contributes at or above the level of\nstatistical accuracy for this sample of clusters, suggesting\nthey are all subdominant. Uncertainty in the assumed\nNFW profile concentration and calibration biases from\ntests using N -body simulations are likely the dominant\nsystematic uncertainties.\n7. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we discuss the level and possible origin\nof scatter in WL and SZ mass statistics, as well as individual cluster systems that exhibit interesting features\nin the data.\n7.1. The Effects of Choice of Radius on Mass Ratios\n\nWe have tested three methods of comparing WL- and\nSZ-derived masses, and find that WL mass statistics evaluated at a fixed radius of R500,SZ exhibit less total scatter\nthan spherical WL masses evaluated at R500,WL (Table\n5). This is primarily because R500,WL , effectively determined from the best-fit profiles to the WL data, has\na greater uncertainty than R500,SZ . Fixing the radius to\nsome externally specified value that has greater precision\nhas the benefit of reducing this source of uncertainty.\nOn the other hand, masses measured at externally\nspecified radii that are themselves determined from a\nmass proxy (such as R500,SZ ) must suffer from correlated\nscatter in addition to any that is intrinsic between the observables. For illustration, if the M500,SZ estimate of R12\nis 20% larger than the true M500 , then the R500,SZ estimate scatters up by 7%, and as a result, the WL aperture\nmass and NFW mass evaluated at R500,SZ also scatter up\nby some amount, under the assumption of monotonically\nincreasing mass profiles. This means that scatter in SZderived masses induces additional, positively correlated\nscatter between WL and SZ masses due to the use of\nR500,SZ , in addition to any intrinsic correlation.\nThis motivates fixing the radius to some value in arcminutes or in Mpc, or more generally to a value derived from any data that are minimally correlated with\nthe mass-observables or have negligible uncertainty. We\nhave tested measuring aperture masses setting \u03b81 =\n0.8h\u22121 Mpc/Dl and \u03b82 = 120 for all clusters, where the\ninner radius is roughly equal to the median R500,SZ\nfor the ensemble. The equivalent statistic for the SZderived mass is also computed. The weighted mean ratio\nresult is hMap,WL (0.8h\u22121 Mpc)/Map,SZ (0.8h\u22121 Mpc)i =\n\n15\n\n1.02 \u00b1 0.18, with total scatter of 35%. Compared to the\nbaseline spherical mass ratio with 34% scatter in Table 5,\nthis increased scatter could be consistent with a \u223c 10%\ncorrelated scatter induced by estimating both the WL\nand SZ spherical masses at R500,SZ .\nWe have also tested fitting NFW profiles to shear\ndata at 0.8h\u22121 Mpc/Dl < \u03b8 < 120 , and evaluating the total mass at 0.8h\u22121 Mpc.\nTo compute the equivalent SZ mass statistic, we evaluate the NFW profile that is consistent with M500,SZ\nalso at 0.8h\u22121 Mpc.\nThe weighted mean result\nis hMNFW,WL (0.8h\u22121 Mpc)/MNFW,SZ (0.8h\u22121 Mpc)i =\n1.12 \u00b1 0.19, with total scatter of 36%. The spherical\nmass ratio result at R500,SZ in Table 5 exhibits 15% less\ntotal scatter (in quadrature), which again may be due in\npart to the added correlation induced by using R500,SZ .\nThis preliminary analysis is suggestive that minimum\nvariance mass comparisons may be achievable by fixing\nthe radius of analysis in Mpc, or some other quantity\nthat has negligible uncertainty or is uncorrelated with\nmass. We note that these choice of radii would have\nnon-trivial complications for cluster cosmological analyses, which usually compare the measured cluster abundance to predictions where cluster masses are typically\ndefined as M\u2206 . However, a rigorous comparison of different mass measures and identification of minimum variance estimators requires quantifying correlations in scatter. We leave this to future work.\n7.2. Disturbed Systems and Line-of-sight Structure\n\nThe primary goal of this work is to provide cosmologically unbiased tests of the scaling of the SZ observable\nwith total mass. As described in Section 5.4, we have\nperformed calibration tests on mock catalogs based on\nray-traced N -body simulations for all halos above a given\nmass, as identified by the N -body cluster finder, without regard to whether the halos have undergone recent\nmerger activity or contain significant structures along the\nline of sight. This approximately mimics the SZ selection,\nwhich is roughly uniform in mass at z & 0.3. The verification exercise indicates no signs of bias to \u223c 2% for both\nthe aperture mass and spherical mass ratio tests, under the simple assumptions adopted in that verification\nstudy. Similarly, we must include any SPT-detected clusters that may exhibit merger activity or contain known\nstructures in the line of sight, as cutting them out risks\nintroducing additional bias in the mean mass ratio tests.\nNonetheless, identifying disturbed systems and significant line of sight structures is of some interest. For example, we note that the inner regions of the shear profiles\n(< R500,SZ ) of SPT-CL J0516-5430 and SPT-CL J20325627 show disagreement with the NFW profiles fitted at\nR500,SZ /Dl < \u03b8 < 120 , and these two cluster systems also\nshow the greatest disagreement between SZ significance\ncentroid, BCG, and \u03ba peak locations. We explore possible explanations here; however, ultimately we conduct\nWL tests in this work in the same way we have tested\nour procedure in N -body simulations, and we therefore\ndo not alter the WL-SZ mass comparison methodology\nbased on the results of these explorations.\n7.2.1. SPT-CL J0516-5430\n\nAndersson et al. (2011) note that SPT-CL J0516-5430\nexhibits north\u2013south elongation in X-ray data obtained\n\n\f16\n\nF. W. High et al.\n\nwith Chandra. Zhang et al. (2008) also note ellipticity\nin XMM-Newton X-ray data for this cluster. Both the\ndistribution of red cluster-galaxies and the convergencemap morphology show north\u2013south elongation as well,\nin rough agreement with the X-ray emission structure\nand SPT SZ significance map. In addition, the convergence peak disagrees with the SZ significance centroid\nand the BCG locations at about 3\u03c3. This suggests that\nthis cluster is unrelaxed. It has been shown that coreexcised X-ray mass-observables are nearly universal for\nrelaxed and unrelaxed clusters (e.g., Mantz et al. 2010a;\nVikhlinin et al. 2009a). The SPT SZ observable is similarly insensitive to the details of the core gas activity, so\nthe SZ-derived mass should not be greatly affected. We\nnote that the WL- and SZ-derived masses are in excellent\nagreement, which may be due to our use of shear profile\ndata only outside the cluster core.\nMcInnes et al. (2009) measured the WL mass of SPTCL J0516-5430 using data from the Blanco Cosmology\nSurvey. The measured masses agree at the \u223c 1\u03c3 level\nafter analytically accounting for the different concentration values used, as well as for the different overdensity\ndefinitions.\n7.2.2. SPT-CL J2032-5627\n\nThe data of the SPT-CL J2032-5627 field show a number of interesting features. First, the two brightest cluster galaxies (both with spectroscopic redshifts consistent\nwith 0.28) have relatively large offsets from the SZ centroid at \u223c 10 each, are of similar luminosity, and are\nalso consistent with two peaks seen in the WL convergence map (see Appendix A), which suggests possible\nmerging activity. Second, the shear profile is suppressed\nwithin R500,SZ , similar to SPT-CL J0516-5430. And\nthird, there is evidence in the literature for a structure\nin the foreground of the higher redshift, spectroscopically confirmed SZ cluster. In this section we explore\nthe possible implications of a foreground interloper and\na plane-of-sky merger on the data.\nThe evidence for a foreground cluster or group is\nstrong. As discussed in detail in Song et al. (2012),\nSPT-CL J2032-5627 is listed by R12 as having an SZ\nlocation that is consistent with the optically identified\ncluster A3685 (location 11500 \u00b1 15000 from the SPT SZ\nposition) and the X-ray detected cluster RXC J2032.15627 (location 8700 from the SPT SZ position). A3685\nis assigned z = 0.062 from just one galaxy (Fetisova\n1981; Struble & Rood 1999), but it is more likely to be\nz = 0.14 because five galaxies near its location are identified at this redshift in the spectroscopic galaxy catalog\nof Guzzo et al. (2009). While RXC J2032.1-5627 is identified at z = 0.14 from the Guzzo et al. (2009) catalog,\nthat catalog also contains six galaxies consistent with the\nredshift we identify for SPT-CL J2032-5627, which is derived from 31 galaxies from our own observations. Song\net al. (2012) conclude that both the X-ray and the SZ\nsignals are likely predominantly arising from a massive\nz = 0.28 cluster, but there is also a cluster at z = 0.14\n(possibly the object identified originally as A3685) spatially consistent with the SZ detection.\nWe explore the possible effects of a foreground interloper and a plane-of-sky merger on the SZ data\nby simulating halos using analytic profiles of Arnaud\net al. (2010), and on the WL data by simulating NFW\n\nhalos. In our first set of simulations, we model an\nM200 = 1014 h\u22121 M (M500 = 0.75 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M ) cluster\nat z = 0.14 and an M500 = 4.30 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M cluster at z = 0.28. The chosen mass of the interloper\nis motivated by the designation of Richness Class 0 to\nA3685 by Abell et al. (1989), which indicates identification of 30\u201349 clustered galaxies and is the smallest\npossible richness on that scale. The velocity dispersion of the five galaxies at this redshift in the Guzzo\net al. (2009) catalog (470\u00b1190km s\u22121 ) suggests a mass of\n14 \u22121\nM200 = (0.8+1.4\nM using the scaling relation\n\u22120.6 ) \u00d7 10 h\nof Evrard et al. (2008), which is also consistent. To reflect\nthe spatial offset of the convergence peaks seen in the\ndata, we separate the cluster centers by \u223c 40 by centering the clusters at the two \u03ba peak locations. We confirm\nfrom these simulations that a foreground object would\nboost WL masses by roughly 50%, while the SZ observable would be boosted by only . 2%. This configuration\nalso reproduces the double peak in the convergence field\nand the suppression of the shear profiles within R500 .\nThe SZ centroid in this case would be centered on the\ngas of the more massive system, which is inconsistent\nwith our data. To reproduce the WL-SZ mass ratios we\nsee in the data, the foreground cluster would have to\nbe M200 = 3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M (M500 = 2.2 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M ),\nwhich is different from the dynamical mass at 1.8\u03c3; however, taking the data together, this larger mass is no more\nor less favored than the central dynamical mass value, as\nthe WL and dynamical masses and the convergence peak\nlocations carry large uncertainties.\nIn our second set of simulations, we model a planeof-sky merger by placing at z = 0.28 two M200 =\n3 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M (M500 = 2.2 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M ) clusters at\nthe \u03ba peak locations, which roughly reproduces a single\nM500 = 4.30 \u00d7 1014 h\u22121 M cluster if naively summed.\nThis configuration also reproduces the double peak in\nthe convergence field and the suppression of the shear\nprofiles within R500 . However, the mass estimates in\nthis case agree well with the SZ derived mass, in contrast to the foreground contaminant simulation and the\nreal data. We would expect the SZ centroid to fall in\nbetween the two merging clusters of similar mass, which\nis consistent with the data.\nIn summary, we cannot fully differentiate between the\ntwo scenarios of a foreground cluster or a merger, or\nquantify their exact effect on the WL and SZ mass estimates, though both scenarios could explain the suppressed shear profile within R500,SZ . The spectroscopic\ndata show strong evidence for a lower mass interloping\ncluster at z = 0.14, which could lead to large WL-SZ\nmass ratios as seen in the data; however, there is significant uncertainty on the interloper's mass making this\ninterpretation inconclusive. The merging scenario would\nbe more consistent with the observed offset in the WL\npeaks from the SZ data and their coincidence with the\nBCGs at z = 0.28, but a merger alone would not explain\nthe large WL-SZ mass ratio. Therefore, the data may be\npointing to a combination of a plane-of-sky merger and a\nforeground interloper. In this section we have quantified\nthe impact of either scenario on the WL and SZ mass\nestimates. Regardless, either scenario does not impact\nthe goal of this work, which is to provide an unbiased\ntest of the accuracy of the masses of an ensemble of SZ-\n\n\fWeak Lensing Measurements of Five SPT Clusters\nselected clusters. We therefore do not treat this cluster\ndifferently from the others in the mean ratio tests.\n7.3. Other Works Comparing WL and SZ-derived\n\nMasses\nAMI Consortium: Hurley-Walker et al. (2012) measured the mass of galaxy clusters with WL data from the\nCFHT and SZ data from the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager (AMI). The four clusters for which both WL and SZ\nmasses were successfully estimated exhibited a weightedmean ratio of WL-to-SZ masses of 0.86 \u00b1 0.14, with total\nscatter of 14%. While this agrees with unity and with\nour baseline results at . 1\u03c3, such a direct comparison\nbetween their work and ours is not straightforward given\nthe different overdensity used (\u2206 = 200), their use of a\njoint Bayesian analysis of the two data sets, and other\ndifferences in analysis techniques.\nPlanck Collaboration: Aghanim et al. (2012) showed\nthat the amplitude of SZ signal derived from Planck\ndata versus WL masses derived from Local Cluster Substructure Survey data obtained with the Subaru telescope disagrees at > 1\u03c3 with results calibrated to X-ray\ndata assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, but in the opposite sense than that predicted by non-thermal pressure\nsupport. That work proposes that systematic errors in\nthe WL analysis could give rise to the discrepancy seen,\nand that further, careful study of systematics is needed\nto determine whether the difference is astrophysical in\norigin. The discrepancy is also seen in the scaling relation result of Marrone et al. (2012), which used the same\nWL data but used SZ data from the SZ Array (SZA).\n8. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have observed five galaxy clusters with the Megacam camera on the 6.5m Magellan Clay telescope, with\nthe goal of measuring total masses with weak gravitational lensing and empirically testing the accuracy of the\nSZ and X-ray\u2013based mass estimates of Reichardt et al.\n(2012, R12). Shear is estimated in deep r0 -band data,\nand additional g 0 - and i0 -band data are used to calibrate\nphotometry using the stellar color\u2013color locus, as well as\nto remove cluster galaxies using color cuts. The source\nredshift distribution is estimated from CFHTLS-Deep\nphotometric redshift catalogs (which do not overlap our\nfields) under the same photometric selections.\nWe adopt three measures of total mass derivable from\nWL data: aperture masses, which are inherently twodimensional quantities; spherical masses derived from\nNFW fits to shear data and evaluated at R500,SZ determined from the SZ data; and the same NFW fits evaluated at R500,WL as determined from the best-fit profiles themselves. In all cases, only shear profiles from\nR500,SZ to 120 are used. To make one-to-one comparisons with the WL derived aperture masses, we compute the aperture mass equivalent statistic of M500,SZ ,\nwhich requires the assignment of an NFW profile using\nconcentration\u2013mass\u2013redshift scaling relations from the\nliterature. For the spherical mass comparison, a c\u2013M \u2013z\nrelation is also adopted to fit models to the shear profiles, and the resulting WL mass is compared directly to\nM500,SZ . Calibration tests are performed on mock catalogs based on ray-traced N -body simulations. These\nshow evidence for bias at levels consistent with a number of previous works, under the assumption of perfect\n\n17\n\nknowledge of cluster centers, galaxy redshifts, and galaxy\nshears. Under all methods, the mean ratio of WL to SZ\nmasses is consistent with expectation of unity to within\nthe statistical uncertainty: the mean aperture mass ratio is 1.04 \u00b1 0.18, the mean spherical mass ratio using\nR500,SZ is 1.07 \u00b1 0.18, and the mean spherical mass ratio\nusing R500,WL is 1.10 \u00b1 0.24. Consistency checks are performed, wherein we make more conservative selections on\nboth the Clay-Megacam and CFHTLS-Deep photometric\ncatalogs, and resulting mean ratios remain statistically\nconsistent with unity and with the baseline results in all\ncases.\nPossible sources of systematic error are explored. The\ndominant sources are most likely the assumption about\nconcentration and calibration to N -body simulations.\nDifferent concentration scaling relations change mean\naperture mass ratios by 2% to 6%, and a few percent\nmore in the mean NFW mass ratios, depending on the\nrelation adopted. Reducing this source of error will be\nkey to unbiased and precise mass constraints, and this\nrequires obtaining knowledge of the concentration of the\ncluster population that SPT detects. The bias levels with\nrespect to N -body simulations is consistent with levels\nseen in other works, at \u22126% to \u221213%.\nThe assumed cluster center is another potential source\nof uncertainty. We show that using the BCG position give nearly exact agreement with baseline results\nin which the SZ position is used. While using the reconstructed convergence field peak gives the greatest deviations from the baseline result, this is probably because\nof noise in centering due to the large statistical uncertainties in determining convergence field peak locations.\nOther sources of systematic error, including shear bias,\nassumed cosmological parameters, and statistical uncertainty on the source redshift distribution, are subdominant to these.\nFor two of the five cluster systems in this work, we\nidentify signs of possible merging activity and structures\nin the line-of-sight. We discuss these systems and simulate the effects of the proposed contaminants. The simulations show that both plane-of-sky merging activity\nand line-of-sight structures can induce multiple peaks in\nthe convergence field and suppress shear profiles within\nR500,SZ , but have different effects on the WL derived\nmasses. The tests are not conclusive about the actual\nphysical configuration of the clusters. The goal of this\nwork is to provide as unbiased a test of the accuracy of\nthe R12 mass estimates of SZ-selected clusters as possible, so we do not treat these clusters differently in our\nanalysis.\nIn conclusion, we find statistical consistency between\nmasses derived from WL data and those derived from\nSZ and X-ray data at the \u223c 20% level. This represents\nfirst steps toward improved galaxy cluster mass estimates\nin the SPT survey. Improving the calibration of massobservables is critical for exploiting the full statistical\npower of the SPT 2500 deg2 survey data set in cosmological cluster abundance studies.\nFacilities: Magellan:Baade (IMACS), Magellan:Clay\n(Megacam),\nWe thank M.

The SZ images\nsubtend 200 on a side. The mapping between color and SZ significance \u03be spans the full range of SZ pixel values in\nthe region of sky shown. The negative lobes are due to the filtering of the time-ordered data and the maps. Black\ncontours correspond to the \u03ba reconstructed from the WL shear catalogs and denote values spaced by \u2206\u03ba = 1/30. The\ndiamond symbols indicate the peak of the reconstructed \u03ba maps over the full field. Contours are dashed where values\nare negative, and solid where values are positive. The white X symbols indicate the centroid from the SZ significance\nmap.\nThe right panels of these figures show the Clay-Megacam images. A false-color composite is presented, with irg\nmapped to the RGB channels, respectively. The same \u03ba contours from the left panels are shown in cyan. White contours\ncorrespond to the SZ significance data from the left panels, spaced at significance values of (\u22128, \u22124, \u22122, 0, 2, 4, 8). The\nhorizontal white lines enclose the BCG of each cluster.\nShear and aperture mass profiles are shown in Figures 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17. The shaded region denotes radii interior\nto R500,SZ . The left panels show the binned shear data with best-fit NFW profiles assuming concentrations of D08.\nThese models are fit at radii \u03b81 < \u03b8 < \u03b82 , where \u03b81 corresponds to R500,SZ .The right panels show the aperture mass\nprofiles within circular apertures of radius \u03b81 . For all data, \u03b82 has been fixed to 120 . The cyan shaded region denotes\nthe \u00b11\u03c3stat excursion in the aperture mass at a given \u03b81 . Cluster masses inferred from SZ data are shown as data\npoints with error bars. These masses have been projected assuming spherically symmetric, three dimensional NFW\nprofiles with D08 concentrations, and then filtered using the same kernel as the WL aperture mass statistic at the\ngiven \u03b81 .\n\n\f20\n\nF.
