Introduction\nn\n\nLet C be the Hilbert space (of column vectors) with the inner product hx1 , x2 i =\nand let Mn be the algebra of complex n \u00d7 n matrices. If X, Y \u2208 Mn then\ntheir inner product is defined by hX1 , X2 i = tr(X1\u2020 X2 ). Let su(n) denote the Lie\nalgebra of SU(n), it consists of all traceless skew-hermitian matrices in Mn .\nThe quantum system that we consider is bipartite. Both parties are qubits, C2 .\nIt will be convenient to identify C4 with the tensor product H = C2 \u2297C C2 , and\nM4 with M2 \u2297C M2 . For X1 , X2 , Y1 , Y2 \u2208 M2 , the inner product of X1 \u2297 Y1 and\nX2 \u2297 Y2 is given by\nx\u20201 x2\n\nhX1 \u2297 Y1 , X2 \u2297 Y2 i = hX1 , X2 i * hY1 , Y2 i.\nIt follows that (X \u2297 Y )\u2020 = X \u2020 \u2297 Y \u2020 and, in particular, the tensor product of\nhermitian matrices is again a hermitian matrix.\nThe space of hermitian matrices H4 \u2286 M4 is the direct sum of the 1D real space\nspanned by the identity matrix, I4 , and the space H4,0 = isu(4). The space H4,0\nis the direct sum of three real subspaces: V1 = H2,0 \u2297 I2 , V2 = I2 \u2297 H2,0 , and\nV3 = H2,0 \u2297 H2,0 . Any mixed state, \u03c1, of our quantum system can be written\nuniquely as the sum of four components;\n1\nI4 + X \u2297 I2 + I2 \u2297 Y + Z,\n4\nwhere X, Y \u2208 H2,0 and Z \u2208 V3 .\nDenote by G the group of local unitary transformations, SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2), where\nwe ignore the overall phase factor. Note that G acts on M4 in the usual manner:\n(g, Z) \u2192 gZg \u2020 and stabilizes the real subspaces H4 and H4,0 . Moreover, each of\nthe subspaces V1 , V2 , V3 is a simple G-module.\n(1.1)\n\n\u03c1=\n\nThe author was supported in part by the NSERC Grant A-5285.\n1\n\n\fD.\u017d. \u2013\nD OKOVI\u0106\n\n2\n\nLet P denote the algebra of real valued polynomial functions on H4,0 and P G\nthe subalgebra of G-invariant functions. Note that P G inherits the Z-gradation\nfrom P. The homogeneous polynomials of P G may be used to construct measures\nof entanglement of our quantum system.\nThe knowledge of P G is important because of the following well known fact:\nTwo states, say \u03c11 and \u03c12 , belong to different G-orbits iff there exists f \u2208 P G such\nthat f (\u03c11 ) 6= f (\u03c12 ). If this holds true for a subalgebra A \u2286 P G , then we say that\nA is complete.\nThe Poincar\u00e9 series (also known as the Hilbert series) of P G was computed by\nM. Grassl et al. [4, Section VI]. We have\nP (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ndim(PdG )z d ,\n\nd=0\n\nPdG\n\nwhere\nis the space of homogeneous polynomial G-invariants of degree d. This\nPoincar\u00e9 series is a rational function of the variable z:\n(1.2)\n\nP (z) =\n\n1 \u2212 z 2 \u2212 z 3 + 2 z 4 + 2 z 5 + 2 z 6 \u2212 z 7 \u2212 z 8 + z 10\n9\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\n(1 \u2212 z) (1 + z) (1 + z 2 ) (1 + z + z 2 )\n\n.\n\nWe remark that in [4] the formula contains an extra factor 1 \u2212 z in the denominator\nbecause the authors work with the space H4 instead of H4,0 .\nThe Taylor expansion begins with\nP (z) =\n\n1 + 3 z 2 + 2 z 3 + 10 z 4 + 7 z 5 + 29 z 6 + 25 z 7 + 73 z 8 + 74 z 9 + 172 z 10\n+187 z 11 + 381 z 12 + 431 z 13 + 785 z 14 + 920 z 15 + 1539 z 16 + 1827 z 17\n+2878 z 18 + 3441 z 19 + 5151 z 20 + 6185 z 21 + 8887 z 22 + 10666 z 23 + * * *\n\nSubsequently, Y. Makhlin [8] gave a simple construction of 18 invariants which\ngenerate a complete subalgebra of P G . This subalgebra is proper and he gives\ntwo additional invariants. However, it is still not established whether this enlarged\nsubalgebra is in fact the whole algebra P G . (According to M. Grassl [3] this can\nbe proved by using the relations for the invariant tensors of SU(2).)\nAs a complement to the two papers just mentioned, we compute in Section 2 the\nZ3 -graded Poincar\u00e9 series of P G . This multigraded series carries more information\nabout the invariants than the simply graded one.\nLet us recall that a mixed state is called separable if it can be represented as a\nconvex combination of product states, and otherwise it is called entangled. Denote\nby M the set of all states and by S the set of all separable states. It is well known\nthat these two sets are compact and convex, and have nonempty interior. By \u2202M\nresp. \u2202S we denote the boundary of M and S, respectively.\nIn Section 3 we show that there is a natural way of decomposing the boundary \u2202S\ninto two pieces. Each of these pieces is a portion of a real algebraic hypersurface\nin the ambient affine space. In particular, it follows from our results that the\nintersection of \u2202S with the relative interior of M is a smooth manifold.\n2. The multigraded Poincar\u00e9 series\nThe direct decomposition H4,0 = V1 \u2295V2 \u2295V3 induces a Z3 -gradation on P which\nis preserved by the action of G. If the space of homogeneous invariants of degrees\nd1 , d2 , d3 (with respect to the coordinates of the three subspaces) has dimension\n\n\fMULTIGRADED POINCAR\u00c9 SERIES FOR TWO QUBITS\n\n3\n\nc, then this fact is recorded in the Taylor expansion of the multigraded Poincar\u00e9\nseries by the term ctd11 td22 td33 .\nTheorem 2.1. The multigraded Poincar\u00e9 series P (t1 , t2 , t3 ) of the algebra P G of\nlocal unitary polynomial invariants of mixed states of two qubits is the rational\nfunction, whose numerator N (t1 , t2 , t3 ) and denominator D(t1 , t2 , t3 ) are given by:\nN\n\nD\n\n=\n\n1 \u2212 t1 t3 2 \u2212 t2 t3 2 + t1 t2 t3 2 + t1 t2 t3 3 + t1 2 t2 t3 3 + t1 t2 2 t3 3 + t1 2 t3 4 + t1 t2 t3 4\n\n=\n\n+t2 2 t3 4 \u2212 t1 3 t2 t3 5 \u2212 t1 2 t2 2 t3 5 \u2212 t1 t2 3 t3 5 \u2212 t1 2 t2 t3 6 \u2212 t1 t2 2 t3 6\n\u2212t1 2 t2 2 t3 6 \u2212 t1 2 t2 2 t3 7 + t1 3 t2 2 t3 7 + t1 2 t2 3 t3 7 \u2212 t1 3 t2 3 t3 9 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 t1 2 1 \u2212 t2 2 1 \u2212 t3 2 (1 \u2212 t1 t2 t3 ) 1 \u2212 t1 t3 2 1 \u2212 t2 t3 2 1 \u2212 t3 3\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1 \u2212 t1 2 t3 2 1 \u2212 t2 2 t3 2 1 \u2212 t3 4 .\n\nThe theorem is proved by using the well-known Molien\u2013Weyl formula.

(1.2), i.e., we have P (z, z, z) = P (z).\nBy expanding P (t1 , t2 , t3 ) in the Taylor series, we find that\nP\n\n= 1 + t1 2 + t2 2 + t3 2 + t3 3 + t1 t2 t3 + 2 t3 4 + 2 t2 2 t3 2 + t2 4 + t1 t2 t3 2\n+2 t1 2 t3 2 + t1 2 t2 2 + t1 4 + t3 5 + t2 2 t3 3 + 2 t1 t2 t3 3 + t1 t2 3 t3 + t1 2 t3 3\n+t1 3 t2 t3 + 3 t3 6 + 4 t2 2 t3 4 + 2 t2 4 t3 2 + t2 6 + 2 t1 t2 t3 4 + t1 t2 2 t3 3 + t1 t2 3 t3 2\n+4 t1 2 t3 4 + t1 2 t2 t3 3 + 4 t1 2 t2 2 t3 2 + t1 2 t2 4 + t1 3 t2 t3 2 + 2 t1 4 t3 2\n+t1 4 t2 2 + t1 6 + * * *\n\nTo make the connection with the notation in Makhlin's paper, we may assume\nthat the components of his vectors s and p are the linear coordinates on V1 and\nV2 , respectively, and the nine entries \u03b2ij of his matrix \u03b2\u0302 are the coordinates on\n\n\fD.\u017d. \u2013\nD OKOVI\u0106\n\n4\n\nV3 . Then it is easy to check that his list of invariants agrees with the information\nprovided by the coefficients in the above Taylor expansion. For instance, the cubic\nterms in the above expansion are t33 and t1 t2 t3 . They correspond to Makhlin's\ninvariants I1 and I12 , respectively.\n3. The boundary of the set of separable states\nUsing Makhlin's notation, we write the components X, Y, Z in Eq.

We shall need only 9 of\nthem:\nI1 = det \u03b2\u0302,\nI4 = s2 ,\n\nI2 = tr(\u03b2\u0302 T \u03b2\u0302),\n\nI5 = [s\u03b2\u0302]2 ,\n\nI12 = s\u03b2\u0302p,\n\nI3 = tr(\u03b2\u0302 T \u03b2\u0302)2 ,\n\nI7 = p2 ,\n\nI8 = [\u03b2\u0302p]2 ,\n\nI14 = eijk elmn si pl \u03b2jm \u03b2kn ,\n\nwhere eijk is the Levi\u2013Civita symbol.\nIn a recent paper [1] Augusiak et al. have shown that S is exactly the set of\nall states \u03c1 satisfying the inequality det \u03c1\u0393 \u2265 0, where \u0393 is the operator of partial\ntransposition, say with respect to the second party. Denote by D the real algebraic\nhypersurface in the affine space (1/4)I4 + H4,0 given by the equation det \u03c1 = 0. Its\nimage under \u0393, which we denote by D\u0393 , is defined by the equation det \u03c1\u0393 = 0.\nLet us recall that \u2202M consists of all \u03c1 \u2265 0 (with tr\u03c1 = 1) having at least one\nzero eigenvalue, and so \u2202M \u2286 D. This inclusion is in fact proper, i.e., \u2202M is only\na small portion of the entire hypersurface D. By the Peres\u2013Horodecki criterion [6]\nwe know that S = M \u2229 M\u0393 . Hence, \u2202S is the union of two pieces:\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2202S = D \u2229 M\u0393 \u222a D\u0393 \u2229 M .\nThe first of these pieces has been mentioned in the paper [13] of Verstraete et al.\nThe polynomial function det \u03c1\u0393 is an invariant of G. We have found the following\nexpression for it in terms of the above Makhlin's invariants:\ndet \u03c1\u0393\n\n=\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 (4I2 + I4 + I7 ) + (4I1 + I12 ) +\n(32I3 \u2212 16I5\n256 32\n2\n16\n\u0001\n2\n2\n2\n\u221216I8 \u2212 16I14 \u2212 16I2 + I4 + I7 + 8I2 I4 + 8I2 I7 \u2212 2I4 I7 .\n\nThere are many papers devoted to the study of the geometry of the sets M and\nS, e.g. [5, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14]. It may be of interest to study the boundary \u2202S and\nthe determinantal hypersurface D in more detail. Let us say that a point \u03c10 \u2208 D is\nsmooth if the gradient \u2207 det \u03c1 does not vanish at \u03c10 , and otherwise it is a singular\npoint of D.\nThe next proposition is valid for any n-dimensional complex Hilbert space H. In\nthis more general setting both D and D\u0393 are hypersurfaces in the real affine space\n(1/n)In + Hn,0 .\n\n\fMULTIGRADED POINCAR\u00c9 SERIES FOR TWO QUBITS\n\n5\n\nProposition 3.1. A point \u03c10 \u2208 D is a singular point of the hypersurface D if and\nonly if \u03c10 has at least two zero eigenvalues.\nProof. Let us arrange the eigenvalues of \u03c10 in increasing order\n\u03bb1 \u2264 \u03bb2 \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03bbn = 1 \u2212\n\nn\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bbk\n\nk=1\n\nand observe that we must have \u03bbn > 0. Since the unitary group U(n) preserves D\nand maps singular points to singular points, we may assume that \u03c10 is in fact the\ndiagonal matrix\n\u03c10 = diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn\u22121 , 1 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03bbn\u22121 ).\nFor an arbitrary \u03c1, the determinant expansion has the form\ndet \u03c1 = \u03c111 \u03c122 * * * \u03c1n\u22121,n\u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03c111 \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03c1n\u22121,n\u22121 ) + P,\nwhere each term of the polynomial P is at least quadratic in the off diagonal entries\nof \u03c1. Hence in evaluating the gradient of det \u03c1 at the point \u03c10 the polynomial P\nmakes no contribution at all, and it suffices to use just the first term of the above\nexpansion, which is written explicitly. We deduce that \u03c10 is a singular point if and\nonly if the following equations hold:\n\u2202 det \u03c1\n(\u03c10 ) = \u03bb1 \u03bb2 * * * \u03bb\u0302k * * * \u03bbn\u22121 (\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bbk ) = 0, 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 1\n\u2202\u03c1kk\nwhere the hat means that \u03bbk should be omitted. It is easy to see that these equations\nare satisfied if and only if at least two of the eigenvalues are 0.\n\u0003\nNote that if n = 2 then it is impossible for both eigenvalues to be 0, which means\nthat in this special case the hypersurface D is smooth. Indeed, we have \u2202M = D,\nD is a shere, and M the corresponding solid 3-dimensional ball.\nThe following corollary follows immediately from the proposition.\nCorollary 3.2. A point \u03c10 \u2208 D\u0393 is a singular point of D\u0393 if and only if \u03c1\u03930 has at\nleast two zero eigenvalues.\nLet us return now to the case of two qubits. In that case we shall prove that the\npiece D\u0393 \u2229 M0 , where M0 denotes the relative interior of M, contains no singular\npoints of the hypersurface D\u0393 , i.e., for each \u03c1 \u2208 D\u0393 \u2229 M0 , the operator \u03c1\u0393 has\nexactly one zero eigenvalue.\nTheorem 3.3. The piece of the hypersurface D\u0393 contained in the (relative) interior\nof M is smooth.\nProof. Assume that a point \u03c10 \u2208 D\u0393 \u2229 M0 is a singular point of D\u0393 . Then \u03c1\u03930 is a\nsingular point of D and so it has at least two zero eigenvalues. We shall now apply\nan argument of Sanpera et al. [11]. By their Theorem 2, the zero eigenspace of \u03c1\u03930\ncontains a product vector |e, f i, and obviously we have\nhe, f |\u03c1\u03930 |e, f i = 0.\nBut this expression is equivalent to\nhe, f \u2217 |\u03c10 |e, f \u2217 i = 0,\nwhich is impossible since \u03c10 \u2208 M0 , and so \u03c10 > 0. This contradiction proves the\ntheorem.\n\u0003\n\n\f6\n\nD.\u017d. \u2013\nD OKOVI\u0106\n\nThe following corollary is obvious.\nCorollary 3.4. The piece of the hypersurface D contained in the (relative) interior\nof M\u0393 is smooth.\nReferences\n[1] R. Augusiak, P. Horodecki, and M.
