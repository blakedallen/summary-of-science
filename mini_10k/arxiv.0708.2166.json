Introduction\nThe \"unseen\" component of the universe (which dominates\nits mass), is a long-standing issue in modern cosmology\nsince the need for dark matter was originally pointed out\nby Zwicky (1933). In a typical cluster of galaxies only 2%\nof the total mass is in the form of galaxies, 10-15% is in\nthe form of hot X-ray emitting gas and the remainder is\ndark matter. Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is an\nalternative theory that can be used to model different observations without assuming the existence of dark matter\n(Milgrom 1983). However, MOND cannot account for all\nthe properties of clusters, where the presence of dark matter remains unavoidable (Gerbal et al. 1992, Pointecouteau\n& Silk 2006).\nThe existence of dark matter can be confirmed by the\ndiscovery of a system in which the observed baryons and the\ninferred dark matter are spatially segregated. One type of\nobject where this separation occurs in is merging galaxy\nclusters. During the collision of two clusters, the galaxies are effectively collisionless particles, while the plasma\nclouds are highly collisional and therefore are slowed by\nram pressure. If dark matter particles are also collisionless,\nas is widely assumed, any dark matter present in the system would be located near the galaxies. One such merging\ncluster system is 1E0657-558 (z=0.296), the so-called bullet cluster. The cluster 1E0657-558 has two primary galaxy\nconcentrations separated by 0.72 Mpc on the sky, a less\nmassive (T=6 keV) western subcluster and a more massive (T=14 keV) eastern main cluster (Markevitch et al.\n2002). Both concentrations have associated X-ray emitting\nSend offprint requests\nprokhoro@iap.fr\n\nto:\n\nD.A.\n\nProkhorov\n\ne-mail:\n\nplasma offset from the galaxies toward the center of the\nsystem (Clowe et al. 2006).\nShock waves driven in the intergalactic medium during the merging of galaxy clusters have been observed in\nX-ray imaging and spectroscopy. Chandra observations of\n1E0657-558 have revealed a bow shock propagating in front\nof a bullet-like gas cloud moving away from the core of\nthe main cluster. Based on the gas density jump across\nthe shock front, Markevitch et al. (2002) derived a Mach\nnumber of the shock \u223c3. The inferred shock velocity of\n\u223c4700 km s\u22121 has been commonly interpreted as the velocity of the \"bullet\" subcluster itself (Markevitch et al. 2002;\nHayashi & White 2006; Markevitch 2006, among others).\nNumerical simulations have very recently been run by\nseveral teams and succeed quite well in reproducing the\nmain properties of the bullet cluster, both qualitatively\nand quantitatively. For example, Milosavljevic et al. (2007)\nconclude that the halo collision velocity need not be the\nsame as the intergalactic gas shock velocity; their simulation finds that the velocity of the CDM halo is \u223c 16% lower\nthan that of the shocks. Springel & Farrar (2007) derived\na shock speed of about 4500 km s\u22121 but a subcluster velocity of only 2600 km s\u22121 in the rest frame of the system,\nso the shock wave propagates faster than the dark matter\nclump. Randall et al. (2007) combine numerical simulations\nwith results derived from X-ray, strong and weak lensing,\nand optical observations to place an upper limit on the\nself-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass\n\u03c3/m, which rules out most of the range previously invoked\nto explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations. Bradac et\nal. (2006) have reconstructed the mass distribution of this\ncluster both from weak and strong lensing data, based on\n\n\f2\n\nD.A. Prokhorov & F. Durret: An approximate theory for subcluster propagation\n\nmulti band high resolution HST ACS images. They confirmed that the total mass in this cluster does not trace\nthe baryonic mass, as already found by Clowe et al. (2004,\n2006).\nFor the description of the X-ray substructure propagation, we are going to use the \"piston in a tube\" model,\ndescribed in Sect. 2. In accordance with this model, an additional retarding force acts on the X-ray substructure. The\nanalysis of substructure propagation is considered in Sect.\n3 for various cluster parameters.\nSeveral estimates from the X-ray observations indicate that\naround 30% of all rich clusters exhibit substructure on a\nscale of 1 Mpc (Forman & Jones 1994). The number of\nrich clusters with substructure is a measure of the fraction\nof galaxy clusters that have recently accreted a significant\nfraction of their mass (Richstone et al. 1992), which can be\nused to determine \u03a9M .\nThe dynamical time of the substructure is derived from the\napproach of Gunn & Gott (1972) in Sect. 4. Unless evaluations of the incidence of X-ray substructures are overestimated or substructure lasts significantly longer than a\ngravitational free-fall time in clusters, the value of the fractional density \u03a9M is larger than 0.5. The retarding force\nhas an effect on the X-ray substructure motion and the\nduration of the merger can be longer than a gravitational\nfree-fall time because of this force.\nWe also apply the \"piston in a tube\" model to the cluster Abell 1763, where the X-ray gas substructure does not\nseem to have gone beyond the main cluster center. A new\nmethod to predict the position of the dark matter halo in\nclusters, where the observed baryons and the inferred dark\nmatter are spatially segregated, is proposed.\n\nVelocity\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFig. 1.

The pressure in front of the substructure\n(region 2)\n\n2. The \"piston in a tube\" model\nThe discovery of a galaxy cluster in which the observed\nX-ray plasma and the inferred dark matter are spatially\nsegregated requires the existence of a retarding force acting on the X-ray substructure. The observed shock front\n(in 1E0657-558) moving ahead of the X-ray clump shows\nsupersonic motion of the gas.\nWe develop a simple 1-D \"piston in a tube\" model to\nderive the analytical expression for the retarding force. The\nretarding force acting on the X-ray clump (piston) in this\nmodel arises because the pressure of the compressed gas\nahead of the piston is higher than the pressure of the rarefied gas behind the piston. Different regions of the flow are\nessential for this model: 1) the region of calm gas ahead of\nthe piston, 2) the region of shocked gas, 3) the region of\nrarefied gas, and 4) the region of calm gas behind the rarefied gas. The piston is situated at the boundary of regions\n2, 3 and moves towards region 1. The shock is situated at\nthe boundary of regions 1, 2.\nIn regions of calm gas, 1 and 4, the velocity of the gas\nequals 0, the pressure is that of the ambient medium. In\nregion 2 (post-shock region), the velocity of the gas equals\nthe piston velocity U, the pressure is higher than the initial\none. In region 3, the rarefaction wave arises; the velocity\nof the gas depends on the distance from the piston and\nthe value of the pressure is smaller than the initial one.\nQualitative sketches of the gas velocity and pressure profiles\nin different regions are plotted in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nFollowing Landau & Lifshitz (1959) we calculate the pressure in front of the substructure (region 2). The shock wave\narises in front of the substructure (which acts as a piston) because the substructure has a velocity higher than\nthe sound velocity in the main cluster. At first the position of the shock coincides with the position of the piston.\nLater the shock wave outdistances the piston and a region\nof shocked gas appears between the shock and the substructure. The gas pressure in front of the shock wave (region 1)\nequals the initial pressure p1 and its velocity equals zero.\nThe gas in the region between the shock and the substructure (region 2) has the substructure velocity. The difference between the velocities of regions 1 and 2 equals the\nsubstructure velocity U.\nThe conditions on the shock (continuity of matter flux,\nmomentum flux, energy flux) can be written as:\n\u03c11 v1 = \u03c12 v2 \u2261 j\n\u03c11 v12\n\n(1)\n\u03c12 v22\n\np1 +\n= p2 +\n(2)\n2\n2\nv1\nv\n+ w1 = 2 + w2\n(3)\n2\n2\nwhere v is the gas velocity in the reference frame of the\nshock, \u03c1 is the gas density, p is the pressure, and w is the\nspecific enthalpy.\nFrom the first equation we find the difference of the velocities:\nj\nj\n\u2212\n= j * (V1 \u2212 V2 )\n(4)\nv1 \u2212 v2 =\n\u03c11\n\u03c12\n\n\fD.A.

The self-similarity solution of the flow is described\nin Landau & Lifshitz (1959), this solution depends on the\nsingle parameter \u03be = x/t, where x is a distance, t is a time\nparameter.

Let us assume that two clusters are\ncompletely virialized structures with masses M1 and M2\n(M2 \u226a M1 , e.g., the cluster 1E0657-558). To approximate\nthe merger velocity of the system, we use the assumption\n(Berrington & Dermer 2003) that the cluster of mass M2 is\na point mass. The main cluster accretes another cluster that\nfalls from a turnaround radius Rta of the system, where the\ntwo subclusters are supposed to have zero relative velocity.\nThe exact value of the turnaround radius does not strongly\naffect the collision velocity as long as it is large and the\ninfall velocity approaches free-fall from infinity. Using the\nenergy conservation law, one can find the velocity of the\nsubcluster with mass M2 at the virial radius Rvir1 of the\nmassive cluster, which has the mass M1 :\n\nFrom Eqs.

Solution taking the tidal force into account\nIt is necessary to consider the influence of the substructure dark matter halo motion on the X-ray substructure\nmotion. The assumption that the small cluster (the dark\nmatter halo and the gas substructure) is a point mass is\nnot acceptable because of the infinite gravitational energy\nat the initial time. It is a reasonable approximation to calculate the tidal force by assuming a NFW profile for the\ndark matter substructure halo. The tidal force acting on the\nsubcluster dark halo is much smaller than the gravitational\nforce between the two dark halos, because the tidal force is\nproportional to the mass of the X-ray gas of the subcluster.\nConsequently the dark matter substructure motion y(\u03c4 ) is\ndescribed by Eq. (48). However, we must include the tidal\nforce in Eq. (47) for the motion of the X-ray substructure\nby analogy with Eq. (46).\n2\nRvir1\n3 |z \u2212 y|\n\u03b4c \u03c1cr \u03a9M Rs2\n\u00d7\nc2s\n(y \u2212 z)3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121 !\n|z \u2212 y|\n|z \u2212 y|\n|z \u2212 y|\nln 1 +\n\u2212\n1+\nRs2\nRs2\nRs2\n\nFtidal = 4\u03c0Mgas2\n\n(53)\n\nwhere z is the position of the X-ray subcluster relative to\nthe main cluster center in the case where the tidal force is\ntaken into account.\n3.5.

The cluster exhibits a prominent bow shock with\na Mach number M = 3.0 \u00b1 0.4. The distance observed between the two centers, corresponding to the X-ray and darkmatter components of the smaller subcluster, is around 200\nkpc, and the distance between the centers of the darkmatter substructures is around 1 Mpc.\nWe approximate the shape of the X-ray subcluster with\na cylinder (radius R=79 kpc and length L=120 kpc). For\nthe first set of parameters, the position of the X-ray substructure is derived from generalized Eq. (47) taking the\ntidal force given in Eq.

The Mach\nnumber of the shock M1 = 3 is found by solving the\nquadratic Eq. (55).\nNumerical hydrodynamical simulations of the bullet\ncluster 1E0657-558 (Springel & Farrar 2007; Milosavljevic\net al. 2007) reached a very similar conclusion to ours: the\nhalo collision velocity need not be the same as the intergalactic gas shock velocity, and while the kinematics of the\nshock are sensitive to the details of the cluster structure, the\ninstantaneous shock velocity can exceed the relative velocity of CDM halos. 2D numerical simulations provide much\nmore precise results than our approximate theory, because\nwe made several simplifying assumptions (e.g., the problem\nis 1-D), and for accurate description of merging clusters\nnumerical simulations are very useful. On the other hand,\nnumerical simulations provide information for very specific\nsets of parameters. One immediate question is what are the\nkey controlling parameters and might they affect the results? For example, using different simulation parameters\nMilosavljevic et al. (2007) and Springel & Farrar (2007)\nfind that the velocities of the CDM halos are respectively\n\u223c16% and \u223c40% lower than that of the shock. Milosavljevic\net al. (2007) strongly emphasize that the shock kinematics\nand morphology are extraordinarily sensitive to the parameters of the simulations. The advantage of our approximative theory is that it has a single characteristic parameter\n\u03bb/\u03c90 , which completely determines the X-ray substructure\nmotion.\nThe similar results of Milosavljevic et al. (2007) and\nSpringel & Farrar (2007), i.e., that the shock velocity is\nhigher than the dark halo velocity, are expected for merging\nclusters, where the characteristic parameter \u03bb/\u03c90 is much\nsmaller than 1. The influence of the retarding force in these\nsystems is negligible and the velocity of the shock is higher\nthan those of the X-ray substructure and the dark halo,\n\n\fD.A. Prokhorov & F.

Position of the dark matter substructure halo\n(kpc) vs dimensionless time tRvir1 /cs for Abell 1763.\nIn order to check this point, we analyzed an optical image of Abell 1763 in the R band taken with the LFC camera\non the Palomar telescope and kindly provided by D. Fadda\n\n\f8\n\nD.A. Prokhorov & F. Durret: An approximate theory for subcluster propagation\n\nand A. Biviano. The SExtractor software was applied to\nthe image, and stars were discarded on the basis of a plot\nof effective radius as a function of magnitude, leading to\na catalogue of galaxies. From a magnitude histogram, the\ngalaxy catalogue was estimated to be complete up to R\n\u223c24. We therefore truncated the catalogue at this magnitude to avoid effects due to incompleteness.\nGalaxies from this catalogue were then counted in\nsquares of 140\u00d7140 kpc2 centered on the cluster center. The numbers of galaxies in each square were found\nto be between 24 and 52, with the lowest number in\nthe NW region, where our model predicts an overabundance of galaxies. The contamination by background galaxies is estimated to be 9 galaxies in each square, as derived from the AAO model by Bland-Hawthorn & Ellis\n(http://www.aao.gov.au/astro/GalaxyCount/).\nThere is therefore no galaxy excess 200 kpc NW of the\ncluster center, indicating that the X-ray gas of the subcluster must have stopped while the galaxies have had time to\ntravel further out. Hence, a direct correspondence between\nthe hottest region in Abell 1763 and the post-shock region\nis not correct. Abell 1763 is therefore a structure in which\nthe observed baryons of the subcluster and the galaxy concentration are spatially segregated; a full analysis of the optical image will be done elsewhere and is beyond the scope\nof this paper.\nDark matter annihilation in the halos of galaxy clusters\nhas relevant astrophysical implications (e.g., Colafrancesco\n2006). In fact, if dark matter is constituted by weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), their annihilation can\nproduce direct observable signals. However, the spatial and\nspectral intensities of the astrophysical signals coming from\n\u03c7\u03c7 annihilation are expected to be confused with, or even\novercome by, other astrophysical signals originating from\nthe intracluster gas and/or from the relativistic plasmas\npresent in the cluster atmospheres, especially when all these\ncomponents are co-spatially distributed with the DM component. An ideal system to detect a DM annihilation signal\nwould therefore be a cluster with a clear spatial separation\nbetween the various matter components (Colafrancesco et\nal. 2007).\n\n4. Evaluation of the incidence of substructures\nClusters of galaxies form by the mergers of smaller clusters and groups. The presence of substructure in clusters of\ngalaxies can be used to estimate the cosmological density\nparameter \u03a9M .\nX-ray data allow the quantification of substructures because cluster mergers compress and heat the intracluster\ngas, and this can be measured as distortions of the spatial\ndistribution of X-ray surface brightness and temperature\n(Forman & Jones 1994; Jones & Forman 1999). An alternative method at optical wavelengths to study substructures\nis based on the distribution of cluster galaxies. However, the\noptical method requires a large number of galaxies (Dutta\n1995), at least a few hundred, and is more susceptible to\ncontamination from foreground and background objects.\nX-ray studies of cluster substructure use a number\nof different statistics (see Buote 2002 for a review).\nSeveral studies have used the ellipticity (Gomez et al.\n1997; Kolokotronis et al. 2001; Melott et al. 2001; Plionis\n2002), while other studies measured centroid (or centerof-mass) variations (Mohr et al. 1995; Gomez et al. 1997;\n\nKolokotronis et al. 2001). Another method developed by\nBuote & Tsai (1995) is the power ratio method, which is\nconstructed from the moments of the X-ray surface brightness.\nRichstone et al. (1992) performed the first theoretical study of the relationship of substructure to cosmology.\nThey assumed that any substructure is wiped out in a cluster crossing time and calculated the fraction of clusters in\nthe spherical growth approximation that formed within the\nlast crossing time as a function of \u03a9M and \u039b. This fraction primarily depends on \u03a9M , and they estimated that\n\u03a9M > 0.5 based on estimates of the frequency of substructure in low-redshift clusters from X-ray images.\nThe approach proposed by Richstone et al. (1992) to\ndetermine \u03a9M suffers several limitations. In their semianalytical calculations they avoided the issue of the power\nspectrum by concentrating on clusters having the same total mass. The collapse time of a 1015 MJ spherical density perturbation was defined to be the dividing point between clusters that do and do not possess substructure. The\nrelationship between the collapse time of a spherical density perturbation and subclustering, though qualitatively\nreasonable, is ambiguous. Consequently, they predict an\nambiguous \"frequency of substructure\" rather than a welldefined quantitative measure of cluster morphology.\nA more recent semi-analytical approach was developed\nby Buote (1998). He assumed that the amount of substructure depends on the amount of mass accreted by a cluster over a relaxation timescale and relates the fractional\naccreted mass to the power ratios. Although these semianalytical methods give an indication of the expected evolution of cluster substructure and its dependence on cosmological parameters, perhaps the best method to constrain\ncosmological models is through the comparison to cluster\nsimulations.\nEvrard et al. (1993) employed N-body/3D gas dynamic\nsimulations of the formation of galaxy clusters and demonstrated the existence of a morphology-cosmology connection for X-ray clusters. Confirming the analytical expectations of Richstone et al. (1992), they showed that cluster\nevolution is sensitive to the cosmological model in which\nthe clusters form. Numerical simulations show that both\nthe centroid shift and the power ratios are capable of distinguishing cosmological models (Evrard et al. 1993; Buote\n& Xu 1997; Valdarnini et al. 1999; Suwa et al. 2003). Buote\n& Xu (1997) find that the power ratios of their ROSAT\nclusters indicate an \u03a9M < 1 universe. Valdarnini et al.\n(1999) find that the \u039bCDM model is inconsistent with the\ndata. However, they used \u03c38 = 1.1, which is fairly high and\nmay cause the disagreement between the \u039bCDM model and\nthe data. Suwa et al. (2003) find that the center shifts and\npower ratios of both surface brightness and projected mass\ndensity are able to discriminate between the cosmological\nmodels at z=0.\nWe uses the value of \u03a9M = 0.268 \u00b1 0.018, which was\nobtained from the WMAP three year observations (Spergel\net al. 2007), to find the dynamical time of the substructure, which is higher than the gravitational free-fall time.\nA plausible reason for this disagreement is that the fraction\nof clusters with X-ray substructures exceed the number of\nclusters that have collapsed during the last gravitational\nfree-fall time due to the retarding force acting on the X-ray\nsubstructure.\n\n\fD.A.

The analytical study of the X-ray substructure motion is proposed in this article. The retarding force must\nbe taken into account to obtain a correct solution. One of\nthe most obvious manifestations of its importance is the\nspatial segregation of the stellar component and the X-ray\nsubstructure in the galaxy cluster 1E0657-558. The behavior of the X-ray substructure depends on the characteristic\nparameter (see Fig. 4) in the \"piston in a tube\" model.\nWhen the characteristic parameter is smaller than 1, the\nX-ray substructure can pass through the main cluster core\n(e.g. 1E0657-558). We also examine the case when the characteristic parameter is higher than 1 and the effect of the\nretarding force is crucial (e.g. Abell 1763). The shock velocity in front of the X-ray substructure is calculated. The\nmethod for predicting the position of the dark matter halo\nin clusters, where the observed baryons and the inferred\ndark matter are spatially segregated, is considered.\nRichstone et al. (1992) used the dynamical time of\nthe substructure to constrain \u03a9M , but their constraint\n\u03a9M > 0.5 does not correspond to the current data. A possible reason for this is that substructure lasts significantly\nlonger than a crossing-time in clusters. The retarding force\ninfluences the substructure dynamical time, which is then\nhigher than the crossing-time. Consequently, an accurate\ndescription of substructure propagation is a requisite to estimate \u03a9M .\nAcknowledgements. The authors thank the referee for useful comments, and G.B. Lima Neto and M.
