INTRODUCTION\n\nThe polars (or AM Her stars) possess the strongest\nmagnetic fields (B \u223c 10 \u2212 200MG) amongst Cataclysmic\nVariables (CVs). In these systems, the plasma transferred from the secondary does not form an accretion\ndisc, but instead the gas is threaded onto the field lines\nand accretes at the poles on the white dwarf (WD) surface. In the simplest picture, a strong shock develops\nin the accretion column, above the surface, as the flow\ntransitions from its high (approximately free-fall) velocity to a subsonic flow that can settle on the WD. The\npost-shock flow is a strong source of hard X-rays, mostly\nemitted as a thermal Bremsstrahlung continuum (with\nkTBr = 10 \u2212 50keV), although line emission can also be\nimportant. Further cooling occurs via cyclotron emission\nin the optical/IR, but is typically an order of magnitude\nsmaller. Half of the hard X-ray photons will be incident\non the WD photosphere, heating it, so that it is a source\nof soft blackbody emission (with kTBB = 20 \u2212 40keV).\n1 Some of the results presented here were obtained with the\nMMT Observatory, a facility operated jointly by The University of\nArizona and the Smithsonian Institution.\n2 Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and with the Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m telescope,\nwhich are owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC)\n3 Department of Astronomy, University of Washington, Box\n351580, Seattle, WA 98195, USA\n4 XMM-Newton Science Operations Centre, ESA/Vilspa, 28080,\nMadrid, Spain\n5 US Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station, P.O.

However, observations of polars\nfound in some cases (but not all) a large discrepancy\nwith LBB /LBr >\n\u223c 5 (see Ramsay et al. 1994, and references therein), which was termed the \"soft X-ray excess.\"\nThe explanation appears to lie in the details of the accretion flow, it is both inhomogeneous, consisting of high\nand lower density regions, and likely blobby. The former\nleads to a hard X-ray deficiency, since the bulk of this\nemission arises from the highest density region, which\nmay involve a small fraction of the total flow. The latter\nleads to enhanced blackbody. In addition to the irradiation heating of the WD photosphere, if the flow is blobby\nthe longest/most dense blobs of material are able to penetrate deeply, before being shocked, and hence the energy\nreleased is thermalized before emission. Lastly, at the\nvery lowest specific accretion rates the flow degenerates\ninto a bombardment solution (Kuijpers & Pringle 1982),\nwhere there are no accretion shocks and the heating of\nthe WD photosphere is also sufficiently weak that we expect no X-ray emission. For a review of the various accretion regimes see Wickramasinghe & Ferrario (2000).\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is in its fourth\nyear of a multi-color photometric imaging and spectroscopic survey, which will eventually cover \u223c25%\nof the celestial sphere (Abazajian et al. 2003, 2004a,b;\nFukugita et al. 1996; Gunn et al. 1998; Hogg et al. 2001;\nLupton et al. 1999, 2001; Pier et al. 2003; Smith et al.\n2002; Stoughton et al. 2002; York et al. 2000). Given\nan imaging limit of g = 23.3 , SDSS is uncovering an\nunprecedented number of faint, low-accretion rate CVs\namongst the > 150 new systems discovered to date (see\nSzkody et al. 2002, 2003, 2004b). Indeed, this is the very\npopulation that is expected to dominate CVs, but due\n\n\f2\n\nHomer et al.\nTABLE 1\nObservation Summary\nSDSS J\n0729\n\n0752\n\n1700\n\nUT Date\n2002 Jan 07\n2002 Oct 31\n2002 Oct 31\n2003\n2003\n2004\n2002\n2002\n2002\n\nSep 22\nNov 01\nFeb 16\nOct 31\nOct 31\nOct 31\n\u2013Nov 01\n\n2003 Nov 01\n2003 Aug 11\n2003\n2003\n2003\n2003\n\nJul 02\nAug 08\nAug 09\nAug 10\n\nObs\nNOFS\nAPO: DIS\nXMM-Newton:\nXMM-Newton:\nXMM-Newton:\nSO: SPOL\nMMT: SPOL\nSO: SPOL\nNOFS\nAPO: DIS\nXMM-Newton:\nXMM-Newton:\nXMM-Newton:\nMMT: SPOL\nXMM-Newton:\nXMM-Newton:\nXMM-Newton:\nNOFS\nMRO\nMRO\nMRO\n\nEPIC-pn\nEPIC-MOS1/2\nOM\n\nEPIC-pn\nEPIC-MOS1/2\nOM\nEPIC-pn\nEPIC-MOS1/2\nOM\n\nUT Time\n05:06\n10:40\n20:39\n20:16\n20:25\n\n\u2013 10:49\n\u2013 11:10\n\u2013 22:16\n\u2013 22:21\n\u2013 22:26\n***\n***\n***\n08:33 \u2013 13:03\n11:22 \u2013 11:37\n23:40 \u2013 01:17\n23:18 \u2013 01:22\n23:27 \u2013 01:28\n***\n16:57 \u2013 19:29\n16:34 \u2013 17:07\n17:53 \u2013 19:34\n03:42 \u2013 10:48\n05:09 \u2013 11:38\n04:44 \u2013 11:11\n04:44 \u2013 10:57\n\nApprox.

Here we report followup XMM-Newton X-ray and optical observations of\nthree additional sources, SDSS J072910.68+365838.3,\n075240.45+362823.2, 170053.30+400357.6 (hereafter\nSDSS J0729, 0752, 1700 for brevity), identified from\ntheir initial SDSS spectra as probable polars. Our\nobservations delineate the accretion regimes via measurement of their hard versus soft X-ray fluxes, and\nconfirm the polar nature of the first two. We note that\nfollow-up spectro-polarimetry of SDSS J1700 reported\nin Szkody et al. (2003) has already confirmed its polar\nnature.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nFor each XMM-Newton observation data are obtained with all detectors. However, for our targets\nthere were never sufficient counts to render the dispersed spectra from the Reflection Grating Spectrograph\n(den Herder et al. 2001) of any use; even for the case\nof SDSS J0752, our brightest target, the continuum is\nbarely detected and no emission lines stand out. Optical Monitor (OM, Mason et al. 2001) data were successfully obtained for only SDSS J0729 and SDSS J0752.\nHowever, in the UVW2 ultraviolet filter (required to\navoid field brightness limits) SDSS J0752 was not detected; data were obtained for SDSS J0729 using the\nB filter. Low-resolution spectra were available from the\nEPIC camera; two MOS detectors (Turner et al. 2001)\n+ the pn (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001), where the pn has roughly\ntwice the effective area of each of the MOS. The UT\n\ntimes, length of total observation and CCD livetime are\nlisted in Table 1. These data were reduced according\nto the guidelines from the main XMM-Newton website\n(Vilspa9 ) and also from the US GOF ABC guide10 , using calibration files current to 2004 March 23 and the\nSAS v6.0. Given the calibration updates since pipeline\nprocessing, as a precaution we used SAS-tools to produce\nnew event list files from the Observation Data Files. To\ncheck on variations in the non-X-ray background we created lightcurves for each entire detector in the 10\u201315 keV\nrange, and where appropriate created new GTIs to exclude intervals of higher background. We also screened\nthese event lists using the standard canned expressions\nand we restricted energies to the 0.1\u201310 keV range. For\nthe two MOS detectors, we used a 320 pixel radius circular aperture size (enclosing \u223c 70% of the energy, chosen to maximize S/N), with a source-free background\nannulus surrounding the source; event pattern\u2264 12 selection was also applied. For the pn, we extracted source\ndata within a 360 pix (again encircled energy\u223c 70%)\nand background data from adjacent rectangular regions\nat similar detector Y locations to the target. As advised,\na conservative choice of event selection, pattern = 0, was\nadopted.\nWe fit simple blackbody (BB) + thermal\nBremsstrahlung (Br) (or MEKAL11 to include line\nemission) models to the various spectra to obtain estimates of the relative contributions of soft (<\n\u223c 0.6 keV)\nand hard (>\n0.6\nkeV)\ncomponents.\nGiven\nthe lack of\n\u223c\ncounts from SDSS J0729 and the need to time-resolve\nthe data from SDSS J0752, we chose to use Cash\nstatistics (Cash 1979), which work better for the case\n9 Available from http://xmm.vilspa.esa.es/external/xmm sw cal/\nsas.shtml\n10 http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/xmm/abc/abc.html\n11\nSee http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/xanadu/xspec/\nmanual/node39.html\n\n\fPolars from the SDSS\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- Low-resolution spectra of SDSS J0729 and SDSS J0752. Both show strong He II\u03bb4686, which is characteristic of actively\naccreting polars. However, the emission lines of SDSS J0729 are narrower than those of SDSS J0752 and lack any indication of structure.\n\u22121\nThis indicates that the accretion rate of SDSS J0729 was low at this time. The flux scale is in units of flux density 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 \u00c5 .\n\nof few counts per bin. For SDSS J1700 the background\nwas a significant contribution (30\u201340%), hence we opted\nto use background subtracted spectra and \u03c72 statistics\nfor fitting. In no cases were we able to reliably constrain\nthe absorbing columns. Hence, by default we adopted\nthe value for the position on the sky given by the\nHEASARC tool nH, based on dust maps. All our targets\nare at high Galactic latitude, leading to values NH \u223c\nfew\u00d71020 cm\u22122 typical of the values measured in most\npolars. However, we do caution that our adopted values\ncould be overestimates since these targets are likely\nwithin a few hundred parsecs of the Sun, and nH gives\nthe column to the edge of the Galaxy.\nLastly, in our fitting we used two sets of energy ranges\n(specifically the lower energy cut-offs), since the reliability of the calibrations at the lowest energies is still\nunclear. The large range (LR) set included energies\n>0.15keV for pn and >0.2keV for MOS, potentially useful for constraining any soft blackbody component. The\nrestricted range (RR) had more conservative cut-off limits of E > 0.3keV (pn) and >0.5 keV (MOS).\nWe extracted light curves for both source and background with SAS task evselect, using the same extraction regions as the spectra, but a less conservative\npattern\u2264 4 for the pn events. Using FTOOLS12 tasks\nwe subtracted the scaled background and converted the\n12\n\nhttp://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/\n\ntime stamps from JD(TT) to HJD(TT)13\nContemporaneous optical spectra for SDSS J0729 and\nSDSS J0752 were obtained on 2002 October 31 using\nthe double-imaging spectrograph (DIS) on the 3.5m telescope at Apache Point Observatory (APO). These were\nreduced and flux-calibrated within IRAF14 . In addition,\ndifferential photometry was obtained for SDSS J0729 (in\n2002 January), and SDSS J0752 (contemporaneously),\nwith the US Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS)\n1m telescope; see Table 1 for details. These data were\ntaken with no filter to give maximum signal-to-nose, but\nan approximate zeropoint for Johnson V was made possible through calibration of the field from all-sky photometry including Landolt standards observed at NOFS.\nHence, the lightcurves are labeled V magnitudes, but\nactually show broad, white light results.

However, we note that\nSDSS J0752 was in a low state during its only observation\non 2003 November 01.\nSDSS J1700 was also observed by the NOFS 1m on\n2003 July 2, and then, close to the XMM-Newton observations, by the 0.76m telescope at Manastash Ridge Observatory (MRO) on 2003 August 8\u201310. Time-resolutions\n\u223c200s were achieved on all nights using no filter, apart\nfrom the final MRO night which used a B filter. Details\nof the observations are listed in Table 1. Differential magnitudes were determined relative to at least three local\nstandard stars in the field.\n3. RESULTS\n\nFrom our contemporaneous optical spectra and/or\nlightcurves we are able to confirm that each of the targets were in their normal active accretion states at the\ntimes of the XMM-Newton X-ray observations. The lowresolution spectra of SDSS J0729 and SDSS J0752 show\nthe characteristic He II\u03bb4686 (Fig. 1), and are in general\nvery similar to their SDSS spectra. The NOFS photometry of SDSS J0752 also gave a consistent V = 18 \u2212 19.\nLikewise SDSS J1700 was observed at B = 19.33 \u00b1 0.03,\n\n3.1. SDSS J0729\nIn the optical, repeatable variability is apparent, with\ntwo full cycles covered. From a PDM analysis we derive\na period of 2.5 \u00b1 0.1 hr. Though of very low S/N, the\nV light curve from the simultaneous OM observations\nshows consistent morphology. In Figure 2 we show the\nfolded lightcurve and also the XMM-Newton lightcurve\nfor an equivalent time interval. The complex optical morphology is reminiscent of that seen in AM Her on occasion (see e.g. Mazeh et al. 1986). G\u00e4nsicke et al. (2001)\nhave recently developed a quantitative model for the B\nand V lightcurves of AM Her. The accretion column,\nresponsible for the optical cyclotron emission, is always\nvisible, with the primary minimum occurring when the\nline-of sight is along the accretion funnel, and the secondary minimum due to partial self-eclipse by the WD\nand/or cyclotron beaming effects.\nThe X-ray flux in SDSS J0729 is undetectable for fully\n0.4 in phase, then brightens significant, possibly for only\n\u223c0.2. This is very similar to the X-ray flare behaviour\nseen in a low state of UZ For (Pandel & C\u00f3rdova 2002),\nsuggesting that the accretion rate is sufficiently low (consistent with the optical spectrum) that any X-ray emitting region is too cool to fall within the XMM-Newton\npassband most of the time. However, given our incomplete phase coverage it is also possible that we are simply\nseeing the X-ray emitting part of the column coming out\nof self-eclipse by the WD. Since the X-ray emitting region is typically smaller and closer to the WD surface\nthan the cyclotron, a much longer X-ray self-eclipse is\ncertainly plausible.\nThe spectrum from this high X-ray flux interval is also\nquite unusual. We fit a Br + BB model to the restricted\nrange; we constrained the temperatures to 30 keV and\n40 eV respectively, as typical values for polars (Warner\n1995). The result indicated that the data do not require\nany soft blackbody component (see Table 2). However,\nas seen in Figure 3, the residuals to the bremsstrahlung\nin the pn data show evidence for a broad line emission\n\n\fPolars from the SDSS\n\n5\n\nfeature at 0.57 keV. In the inset we show a fit to the\nline (with a linear scale). Given the low S/N, the significance of this feature remains questionable. We did\ncheck whether it was an artifact of binning, by trying\nbinning with 4 to 7 counts per bin instead, but it appeared consistently. A line at this energy could be due\nto strong O VII emission; we note that a number of strong\nO VI lines are present in the spectra of AM Her in the\nextreme UV (Mauche & Raymond 1998).\n3.2. SDSS J0752\nSimilar to SDSS J0729, the optical light curve of\nSDSS J0752 exhibits a large amplitude variation, with\na prominent minimum, and additional flux reductions\n\u223c0.3 later in phase (Fig. 4). The PDM analysis reveals\na period of 2.74 \u00b1 0.05 hrs. Although the ephemeris is\nnot well-constrained, the optical observation took place\nonly five cycles prior to the X-ray and we can phase the\nlatter to within 0.1 cycles. We therefore tentatively identify the X-ray and optical minima present at close to our\n\u03c6 = 0.0 as due to self-eclipses. In X-rays there appears\nto be a short interval of complete occultation, but unfortunately, the eclipse is right at the start of the MOS\nexposure. In the broad band optical curve, the eclipse is\nonly partial as expected for the less localized cyclotron\nand other optical emission sites.\nThe optical flux dips at \u03c6 \u223c 0.3, again considering the\nAM Her case, could well be due to the observer looking\ndown along the accretion funnel at this interval. Moreover, immediately following the X-ray eclipse there is\na distinct hump before the source settles into a fairly\nsteady flux level; though we note that a QPO on a 700s\ntimescale appears towards the end of the observation.\nLight curves constructed for soft (0.1\u20130.6 keV) and hard\n(0.6\u20138 keV) bands, provide further insight. The hump\nis much more striking in the soft band, with the flux returning to a low (but non-zero) level for the remainder\nof the observation, whereas the hard band appears to\ncome out of eclipse and remain at a constant high level\nthereafter.\nWe also extracted phase resolved spectra to examine\nthe changes in greater detail (see Table 2). For the interval after the hump (HJD> 2452579.495), we fit a basic\nBr + BB model (Fig. 6) and found that in this system,\nthe BB component is very significant; with an F-test\ngiving probabilities > 99.99% for either the LR or RR\n(though the parameters are naturally better constrained\nfor the former). Indeed, the BB contributes half of the\nunabsorbed flux in the 0.01\u201310.0 keV range, though we\ncaution that the exact fraction is model dependent and\ncould be a factor of 2 different.\nDuring the hump, we were restricted to the MOS data\nalone, and chose to fix kTBr at the value found previously\nin the combined MOS + pn after-hump dataset. The fit\nyielded kTBB = 65 eV in both cases; hence, the change\nin the BB flux is not due to a change in temperature, but\nrather to differing normalizations. This suggests that as\nSDSS J0752 emerges from eclipse, we can see the BB\nemission region fully before it is once again obscured,\nmost likely by the accretion column; consistent with our\nmodel for the optical lightcurve.\n3.3. SDSS J1700\n\nFig. 4.- Optical and X-ray lightcurves of SDSS J0752. Top:\nOrbital phase-folded V band lightcurve. Bottom: 100s binned\nlightcurves from EPIC-MOS (left) and pn (right). The total energy\nband and a soft and hard bands are shown; note that the egress\nfrom the probable eclipse is much more gradual at > 0.6 keV, and\nthe post-eclipse hump is most prominent in the soft. Approximate\nphase is shown on the top axes; the solid bar represents the uncertainty on T0 at this time. Note HJD(UT)=HJD(TT)\u201364.184 s at\nthis epoch.\n\nIn Figure 7 we present the four nights of optical data,\nwith the best fit sinusoid over-plotted. The morphology\nof the orbital modulation is indeed close to sinusoidal,\nalthough as illustrated in the phase folded and binned\nplots (Fig. 8), the exact shape changes subtly from night\nto night. Comparison to the 2001 August lightcurves\npresented in Szkody et al. (2003) shows more conspicuous differences, at that time the shape comprised broad\nmaxima and narrow minima, in contrast to the 2003 morphology. To derive an ephemeris, we first used a modified discrete Fourier transform, the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (Scargle 1982), to determine the approximate\nbest period. This was then refined by cycle counting\n(O \u2212 C method), and finally by fitting a sinusoid model\nto the entire dataset, yielding:\nHJD(TT)max = 2452859.0103(3) + 0.08080175(8) \u00d7 n\nwhere HJD(TT)max is the time of maximum light, and\nthe parenthetical values indicate the estimated 1\u03c3 uncertainties in the final digits. With this precision we are\neasily able to phase the X-ray lightcurve (Fig. 9).\nUnfortunately, during this XMM-Newton observation,\nthere were technical problems, hence although we are\nable to accumulate data from all the small intervals of\nCCD livetime, the MOS data were completely unusable\n\n\f6\n\nHomer et al.\nPost\u2212eclipse Hump\n\nAfter Hump\n\nkT (Br)= 11.4 keV (fixed)\nkT (BB)= 65 eV\n\nkT (Br)= 11.4 keV\nkT (BB)= 65 eV\n\nFlux ratio BB: Br\n1.3:1.0\n\nFlux ratio BB: Br\n1.0:1.0\n\nFig. 5.- Unfolded EPIC-MOS photon spectra of SDSS J0752.

The best fit blackbody and bremsstrahlung\nmodel is over-plotted and residuals are shown below.\n\nfor timing and only parts of the pn could be used to reliably construct a light curve. However, given the limited\ncoverage it does seem that the X-ray flux is modulated\nin anti-phase to the optical.\nThere are at least two alternate explanations for the Xray and optical lightcurves. In the first, like SDSS J0729\nand SDSS J0752 a single accretion pole is visible in\nSDSS J1700. The optical modulation is then a result\nof our viewing of the cyclotron emission, with the mini-\n\nmum occurring when we view down the accretion funnel.\nAs narrower cyclotron beaming occurs at shorter wavelengths we then obtain the broader minimum in the B\nband (see Bonnet-Bidaud et al. 1985). In contrast, the\nX-ray emission reaches a maximum when the normal to\nthe accretion spot is close to our line-of-sight. The second model invokes two visible accretion poles, and as\nis the case during the \"reversed\" state of AM Her, the\noptical emission is dominated by one, and the X-ray by\nthe other. The X-ray/optical minima are then due to\ntotal/partial self-eclipses respectively. Only longer contemporaneous observations of SDSS J1700 will be able\nto resolve this issue.\nAs a consequence of the limited live time, the X-ray\nspectrum is of low S/N. We fitted a variety of models\nto the RR and LR (see Table 2). In no case was a soft\nBB component (fixed at 40 eV) required. For the Br we\nfound a very poorly constrained temperature of 8+9\n\u22123 keV.\nA single temperature MEKAL fit the data equally as\nwell, but with a slightly better constrained kT = 7+5\n\u22122 keV\n(see Fig. 10). In summary, the spectrum of SDSS J1700\nis typical of a polar, with a plasma T \u223c 10 keV, but no\nadditional soft component is required.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe XMM-Newton and optical observations presented\nhere provide useful constraints on the accretion characteristics of SDSS J0729, SDSS J0752 and SDSS J1700.\nIn terms of accretion geometries, we find SDSS J0729\nis likely a single pole accretor, exhibiting a complex optical lightcurve due to the combined effects of cyclotron\nbeaming and partial occultation of the emitting region.\nThe X-ray variation, consisting of a single high flux in-\n\n\fPolars from the SDSS\n\nFig. 7.- Differential photometry of SDSS J1700 from NOFS\nand MRO during 2003 July\u2013August.

In any\ncase, the X-ray spectrum at this time is most unusual,\nbeing well-modeled by the usual hard bremsstrahlung,\nbut also requiring a strong emission line at 0.57 keV.\nThis line is probably due to O VII emission, and it is interesting to note that similar strong emission lines (of\nO VI) are seen in the extreme UV spectra of AM Her\n(Mauche & Raymond 1998).\nThe data on SDSS J0752 also appear to be consistent\nwith a single pole accretor. Both the X-ray and optical\nlightcurves show self-eclipses by the WD. In the optical\nat \u03c6 \u223c 0.3 there are additional dips in the flux, possibly due to cyclotron beaming and/or obscuration effects. In the soft X-ray, the eclipse is followed by a short\nrise in flux, then a long interval at a lower level perhaps due to obscuration by the accretion column itself.\nThis is the brightest source in X-rays, and we are able\nto constrain both the BB and Br components fairly well.\nWe find a typical kTBr = 11 keV, but a somewhat high\nkTBB = 65 eV, though the latter may relate to the remaining low energy calibration uncertainties of the EPIC\ninstruments. Bearing this, and the uncertainty in the\nabsorbing column which we could not constrain, in mind\nwe can derive a value for the soft/hard X-ray energy bal-\n\n7\n\nFig. 8.- The data from Figure 7 phase folded and binned\naccording the best fit ephemeris.

Taking into account the geometrical effects, the Xray scattering albedo of the WD photosphere, aX = 0.3\n(Williams et al. 1987), but not the cyclotron term (typically negligible compared to the Br) we find LBB /LBr \u2248\n(\u03c0fBB (1 \u2212 ax )d2 )/(2\u03c0fBr (1 + ax )d2 ) = 0.35 \u2212 0.5. This is\nwell-within the range found in a recent survey of polars\nby Ramsay & Cropper (2004), and in agreement with the\nbasic picture of X-ray emission from radial accretion.\nFor SDSS J1700 the lightcurves allow two alternate\nmodels, either a single or two pole accretor, and both\nare able to explain the anti-phasing of the X-ray and optical modulations.

Using 0.15\u201310 keV for pn and 0.2\u201310 keV for MOS to make most\nof low-energy response. RR= Restricted Range. More conservative lower energy limits\nimposed: 0.3\u201310 keV for pn and 0.5\u201310 keV for MOS.\nb For SDSS J0729 and SDSS J0752 where the fitting utilized Cash statistics, the goodness\nof fit is found via a Monte Carlo method. Sampling each parameter randomly within its\nallowed distribution >\n\u223c 1000 spectra were simulated, and a fit performed. The percentage\nrefers to the incidence of fits with lower C-statistic values than that of the fit to the data.\nA good fit should have a value around 50%. For SDSS J1700 the reduced \u03c72 is quoted.\nc Unabsorbed flux in the 0.01\u201310 keV range, in units of 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , including the\ncorrection for the 70% encircled energy fraction.\nd (f) indicates that the parameter was frozen at this value.\ne For a single-component Bremsstrahlung model the percentage was 100%, clearly indicating the need for the blackbody.\n\n\f"}
