Suitably normalized, Re \u03a9 is a calibrated\nform whose calibrated submanifolds are called special Lagrangian (SL) submanifolds;\nsee Harvey and Lawson [22]. SL submanifolds are thus a very natural class of\nvolume-minimizing submanifolds in Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds. SL submanifolds also\nappear in string theory as \"supersymmetric cycles\" and play a fundamental role in\nthe Strominger\u2013Yau\u2013Zaslow approach to mirror symmetry [48]. In SYZ-related work\nand also in other problems in special Lagrangian geometry, singular SL objects play a\nfundamental role. This has motivated a considerable amount of recent work devoted to\nsingular SL submanifolds [9, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 39].\nSo far, the most fruitful approach to understanding singular SL objects has been to\nfocus on special types of singularities. For example, one might study ruled SL 3\u2013folds,\nU(1)\u2013invariant SL 3\u2013folds, or SL 3\u2013folds with isolated conical singularities. In\nPublished: 21 October 2006\n\nDOI: 10.2140/gt.2006.10.1453\n\n\f1454\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nparticular, a special Lagrangian n\u2013fold with isolated conical singularities is a singular\nSL n\u2013fold with an isolated set of singular points each of which is modelled on a SL\ncone in Cn . We call such a singular SL n\u2013fold a special Lagrangian conifold. In a\nseries of five papers, Joyce developed the basic foundations of a theory of compact SL\nconifolds in (almost) Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds [29].\nIn particular, Joyce studied the desingularization theory of SL conifolds. The desingularization theory has both local and global aspects; since the global aspects are described\nin detail in [29], it remains to understand the local smoothing question. More concretely,\ngiven a SL cone C in Cn we would like to understand all asymptotically conical SL\n(ACSL) n\u2013folds in Cn which at infinity approach the given cone C. We call this the\nACSL smoothing problem.\nThe main aim of this paper is to study the ACSL smoothing problem and various closely\nrelated questions. To begin with we prove a number of nonsmoothing results. For\nexample, we exhibit an explicit SL cone C in C6 whose link is a 5\u2013manifold which is\nnot nullcobordant. Hence C is an isolated SL singularity which for topological reasons\ncannot admit any smoothing whatsoever.\nWe then show that there are infinitely many explicit SL cones which admit no ACSL\nsmoothings (with rate \u03bb \u2264 0 \u2013 see equation (2\u20135) for the precise definition). On the other\nhand, infinitely many of these SL cones have links which are nullcobordant. Therefore\nthere is no differential-topological obstruction to smoothing these singularities; in fact,\nour obstruction to ACSL smoothings arises from analytic constraints implicit in the SL\ncondition.\nGiven such an SL cone C, it is natural to ask whether C admits Lagrangian rather than\nspecial Lagrangian smoothings. In fact, since any SL submanifold has zero Maslov\nclass, the natural weakening of the SL smoothing question to the Lagrangian category is\nto ask whether C admits Maslov-zero Lagrangian smoothings. Therefore the main focus\nof the paper is on the Lagrangian-topological aspects of these smoothing questions,\nviewed as a preliminary step toward a better understanding of the existence/nonexistence\nof ACSL smoothings and SL desingularizations of SL conifolds.\nMore specifically, in this paper we address questions such as the following:\n(1) Let C be a SL cone in Cn . Does there exist a smooth complete oriented immersed\nLagrangian submanifold Y which coincides with C outside the sphere S2n\u22121 ?\nWhat can we say about the topology of Y ? Can we find such a Y with zero\nMaslov class?\n(2) Let X be a SL conifold in an (almost) Calabi\u2013Yau manifold. Does there exist a\nMaslov-zero Lagrangian submanifold Y which coincides with X away from a\nneighbourhood of its singularities?\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1455\n\nWe think of these two questions as soft analogues of the SL desingularization problem.\nNotice, in particular, that in questions (1) and (2) the smoothings coincide with the\noriginal singular object outside a compact set. Real analyticity would prevent this from\nhappening in the SL case: for example, a complete ACSL smoothing of a SL n\u2013cone C\nwill never coincide with C in an open set (or even intersect it along a (n\u22121)\u2013dimensional\nsubmanifold). We can take this behaviour into account by prescribing other types of\nasymptotics on the \"ends\" of Y . Hence one could also ask the following as a soft\nanalogue of the existence question for ACSL smoothings.\n(3) Let C be a SL cone in Cn with link \u03a3. Suppose we are given a Maslov-zero\nLagrangian conical end, ie a Maslov-zero Lagrangian immersion f of \u03a3 \u00d7 [1, \u221e)\nwhich is asymptotic to C at infinity. What Maslov-zero Lagrangian \"fillings\" of\nthe conical end f exist?\nAll these Lagrangian smoothing problems can be viewed as particular cases of a certain\nboundary value problem for Lagrangian submanifolds which we call the Prescribed\nBoundary Problem and study in Section 4. The Prescribed Boundary Problem is related\nto but different from the notion of Lagrangian cobordism groups introduced by Arnold\n[1] and studied in greater depth by Audin [3, 4].\nAt least in the category of immersed Lagrangian submanifolds it turns out that the\nPrescribed Boundary Problem is a soft problem, in the sense that it obeys an h\u2013principle;\nusing the relative version of the Gromov\u2013Lees h\u2013principle for Lagrangian immersions\nwe reduce the solvability of the Prescribed Boundary Problem to the problem of\nextending a certain map from the boundary of a manifold with boundary to its interior.\nThis converts the solvability question into a problem in homotopy theory, which we use\nobstruction theory to study.\nWe show that in general there are obstructions to solving the Prescribed Boundary\nProblem and therefore obstructions to smoothing our Lagrangian singularities. To\nillustrate this we give explicit examples of initial data for which the Prescribed\nBoundary Problem has no solutions. Moreover, in low dimensions we can identify\nthe obstructions very concretely and in particular identify situations in which all the\nobstructions vanish. An easy corollary of this is that any SL conifold in dimensions\n2 or 3 admits infinitely many topologically distinct oriented Maslov-zero Lagrangian\ndesingularizations (Theorem 6.7 and Corollary 6.11). In particular, any SL cone in C2\nand C3 admits infinitely many topologically distinct oriented Maslov-zero smoothings\n(Corollary 6.9).\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows:\nIn Section 2 we prove various nonsmoothability results for special Lagrangian singularities. Section 2.1 serves as an introduction to smoothing problems for isolated\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1456\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nconical singularities of minimal varieties, recalling known smoothing results for volumeminimizing hypersurfaces. Section 2.2, Section 2.3 and Section 2.4 recall basic\ndefinitions and facts about Lagrangian/special Lagrangian geometry, special Lagrangian\ncones and asymptotically conical special Lagrangian n\u2013folds respectively. In Section 2.5\nwe prove a first nonsmoothability result, Theorem 2.2. After recalling some basic\nresults about G\u2013invariant SL n\u2013folds in Section 2.6, in Section 2.7 we prove a further\nnonsmoothability result, Theorem 2.11.\nIn Section 3.1\u2013Section 3.3 we recall the Gromov\u2013Lees h\u2013principle for Lagrangian\nimmersions of closed manifolds [17, 38], focusing on how it reduces an a priori\ngeometric question to a topological one. Section 3.4 discusses the Maslov class of a\nLagrangian immersion in Cn and uses the Lagrangian h\u2013principle to prove a Maslovclass realizability result, Proposition 3.19. Section 3.5 gives examples to demonstrate\nhow the h\u2013principle provides an effective tool to prove both existence and nonexistence\nresults for Lagrangian immersions. The material of this section is well-known but\nis included both as an introduction to the h\u2013principle for h\u2013principle novices and to\nestablish notation, terminology and some results that are needed in Section 4. Those\nalready comfortable with the Lagrangian h\u2013principle are advised to skim this section\nand proceed to Section 4.\nIn Section 4.1\u2013Section 4.2 we describe the Lagrangian Cobordism Problem, some\nobstructions to solving it and a refinement of it which we call the Prescribed Boundary\nProblem. Both problems are boundary value problems for Lagrangian immersions\nin Cn of compact manifolds with boundary. In Section 4.3 we show how to use\na relative version of the h\u2013principle for Lagrangian immersions (Theorem 4.6) to\nanalyze the solvability of the Prescribed Boundary Problem. As a result we reduce the\nsolvability of the Prescribed Boundary Problem to a problem in algebraic topology (see\nLemma 4.11); namely, does a certain map with values in GL(n, C) extend continuously\nfrom the boundary to the interior? In Section 4.4 we recall a standard obstruction\ntheory framework for analyzing extension problems and apply it to the case-at-hand.\nWe pay particular attention to cases in which either all obstructions vanish or where\nthe obstructions can be described particularly concretely. For example, in less than 6\ncomplex dimensions there are exactly two obstructions to extending the map in question;\nin Theorem 4.16 we write down these obstructions explicitly. One obstruction is closely\nrelated to the Maslov class of the initial data; moreover in dimensions 2 and 3 the other\nobstruction vanishes. This allows us to prove particularly nice results for Maslov-zero\ninitial data in these dimensions.\nIn Section 5.1\u2013Section 5.3 we apply the results of Section 4 to study the solvability of\nthe Prescribed Boundary Problem in complex dimensions 5 and less, taking care to\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1457\n\nshow how our Assumptions A\u2013C can be satisfied. The main results are Theorem 5.4,\nTheorem 5.8 and Theorem 5.12.\nIn Section 6 we return to the soft Lagrangian desingularization problems and address\nQuestions (1)\u2013(3) of Section 1 using the results of Section 5. We introduce a class of\nsingular oriented Lagrangian submanifolds called oriented Lagrangian submanifolds\nwith exact isolated singularities. This class includes the SL conifolds studied by\nJoyce in the series of papers summarized in [29]. In Theorem 6.7 we add the Maslovzero assumption and apply our results from Section 5 to prove desingularization and\nsmoothing results for Lagrangian submanifolds of this type in C2 and C3 . Section 6.2\nextends these results to almost Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds, while Section 6.3 addresses\nQuestion (3) above.\nIn Appendix A we compare the work of this paper to existing work in the Lagrangian\nand special Lagrangian literature.\nThe authors would like to thank IHES, Georgia Tech and Imperial College for their\nhospitality. TP would like to thank NSF and MH would like to thank EPSRC for\nsupporting their research. The authors would also like to thank Rick Schoen for\nsuggesting the problem, Yasha Eliashberg for some h\u2013principle assistance and Dominic\nJoyce for suggesting improvements to an earlier version of the paper.\n\n2\n\nNonsmoothable special Lagrangian singularities\n\nThe singularities of area-minimizing surfaces and codimension 1 volume-minimizing\nobjects are by now fairly well-understood. In higher dimension/codimension, examples\nshow that a far wider range of singular behaviour is possible and as a consequence\nmany codimension one results fail in higher codimension. However, for special types\nof volume-minimizing objects, particularly calibrated submanifolds (or currents), one\nmight still hope that some codimension one features survive. In the case of smoothability\nof special Lagrangian singularities, however, we will see shortly that such optimism\nwould be misplaced.\n\n2.1\n\nSmoothability of isolated conical singularities of minimal varieties\n\nLet C be a minimal hypercone in Rn with Sing(C) = (0). Then the link of the cone,\n\u03a3 = C \u2229 Sn\u22121 , is an embedded smooth compact (n \u2212 2)\u2013dimensional minimal manifold\nof Sn\u22121 . It follows from the Maximum Principle that \u03a3 must be connected. Since \u03a3 is\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1458\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nan embedded hypersurface of Sn\u22121 and the tangent bundle of Sn\u22121 is stably trivial, it\nfollows that the tangent bundle of \u03a3 is also stably trivial. This implies that the link of\nany minimal hypercone is nullcobordant (see Section 2.5) and therefore admits some\n(topological) smoothing.\nIn fact, Hardt and Simon proved the following smoothing result for volume-minimizing\nhypercones:\nTheorem 2.1 [21, Theorem 2.1] Let C be a minimizing hypercone C in Rn with\nSing(C) = (0) and as above let \u03a3 denote the link of the cone. Let E denote one of\nthe two components of Rn \\ C. Then E contains a unique oriented embedded real\nanalytic nonsingular volume-minimizing hypersurface S with empty boundary such\nthat dist(S, 0) = 1. The hypersurface S has the following additional properties:\n(i) For any v \u2208 E, the ray {\u03bbv : \u03bb > 0} intersects S in a unique point, and the\nintersection is transverse.\n(ii) (Up to orientation) any oriented minimizing hypersurface contained in E coincides\nwith some dilation of S.\n(iii) S is asymptotically conical in the sense that there exists some T > 0 and some\ncompact subset K \u2282 S so that S \\ K is diffeomorphic to (T, \u221e) \u00d7 \u03a3 and so\nthat outside K , S is graphical over the cone C for some C2 graphing function\nv (which satisfies some decay conditions at infinity \u2013 see Hardt and Simon [21,\npage 106 equation 1.9] for details).\nMoving to higher codimension, in the spirit of the previous paragraphs it is natural\nto ask whether calibrated cones have canonical desingularizations analogous to those\nof minimizing hypercones. In particular, for special Lagrangian cones Rick Schoen\noriginally posed this question to the authors at the IPAM Workshop on Lagrangian\nsubmanifolds; the authors would therefore like to thank him for suggesting this problem.\nUnfortunately, it is not true that SL cones admit canonical SL smoothings; we give\nexamples below to show that there are SL cones which admit no SL smoothings\nwhatsoever.\nTo proceed further first we recall some basic definitions from Lagrangian and special\nLagrangian geometry.\n\n2.2\n\nCalibrations and special Lagrangian geometry in Cn\n\nLet (M, g) be a Riemannian manifold. Let V be an oriented tangent p\u2013plane on M ,\nie a p\u2013dimensional oriented vector subspace of some tangent plane Tx M to M . The\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1459\n\nSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\nrestriction of the Riemannian metric to V , g|V , is a Euclidean metric on V which\ntogether with the orientation on V determines a natural p\u2013form on V , the volume form\nvolV . A closed p\u2013form \u03c6 on M is a calibration [22] on M if for every oriented tangent\np\u2013plane V on M we have \u03c6|V \u2264 volV . Let L be an oriented submanifold of M with\ndimension p. L is a \u03c6\u2013calibrated submanifold if \u03c6|Tx L = volTx L for all x \u2208 L.\nThere is a natural extension of this definition to singular calibrated submanifolds using\nthe language of Geometric Measure Theory and rectifiable currents [22, Section II.1].\nThe key property of calibrated submanifolds (even singular ones) is that they are\nhomologically volume minimizing [22, Theorem II.4.2]. In particular, any calibrated\nsubmanifold is automatically minimal, ie has vanishing mean curvature.\nLet z1 = x1 + iy1 , . . . , zn = xn + iyn be standard complex coordinates on Cn equipped\nwith the Euclidean metric. Let\nn\nn\nn\n\u0011\nX\n1\u0010 X\niX\ndxj \u2227dyj = d\u03bb, where \u03bb =\ndzj \u2227dz\u0304j =\nxi dyi \u2212yi dxi ,\n(2\u20131) \u03c9 =\n2\n2\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nbe the standard symplectic 2\u2013form on Cn . Recall that an immersion i : Ln \u2192 R2n\nof an n\u2013manifold L is Lagrangian if i\u2217 \u03c9 = 0 or, equivalently, if the natural complex\nstructure J on R2n = Cn induces an isomorphism between TL and the normal bundle\nNL.\nDefine a complex n\u2013form \u03a9 on Cn by\n(2\u20132)\n\n\u03a9 = dz1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dzn .\n\nThen Re \u03a9 and Im \u03a9 are real n\u2013forms on Cn . Re \u03a9 is a calibration on Cn whose\ncalibrated submanifolds we call special Lagrangian submanifolds of Cn , or SL n\u2013folds\nfor short. There is a natural extension of special Lagrangian geometry to any Calabi\u2013Yau\nmanifold M by replacing \u03a9 with the natural parallel holomorphic (n, 0)\u2013form on M .\nMore generally, let f : L \u2192 Cn be a Lagrangian immersion of the oriented n\u2013manifold\nL, and \u03a9 be the holomorphic (n, 0)\u2013form defined in (2\u20132). Then f \u2217 \u03a9 is a complex\nn\u2013form on L satisfying |f \u2217 \u03a9| = 1 [22, page 89]. Hence we may write\n(2\u20133)\n\nf \u2217 \u03a9 = ei\u03b8 volL\n\non L,\n\nfor some phase function ei\u03b8 : L \u2192 S1 . We call ei\u03b8 the phase of the oriented Lagrangian\nimmersion f . L is a SL n\u2013fold in Cn if and only if the phase function ei\u03b8 \u2261 1. Reversing\nthe orientation of L changes the sign of the phase function ei\u03b8 . The differential d\u03b8 is a\nwell-defined closed 1\u2013form on L satisfying [22, page 96]\n(2\u20134)\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\nd\u03b8 = \u03b9H \u03c9,\n\n\f1460\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nwhere H is the mean curvature vector of L. The cohomology class [d\u03b8] \u2208 H 1 (L, R) is\nclosely related to the Maslov class of the Lagrangian immersion defined in Section 3.4.\nIn particular, (2\u20134) implies that a connected component of L is minimal if and only if\nthe phase function ei\u03b8 is constant. ei\u03b8 \u2261 1 is equivalent to L being special Lagrangian;\nif ei\u03b8 \u2261 ei\u03b80 for some constant \u03b80 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) we will call L, \u03b80 \u2013special Lagrangian or\n\u03b80 -SL for short. \u03b80 -SL n\u2013folds are calibrated submanifolds with respect to the real part\nof the rotated holomorphic (n, 0)\u2013form, \u03a9\u03b80 = e\u2212i\u03b80 \u03a9.\n\n2.3\n\nSpecial Legendrian submanifolds and special Lagrangian cones\n\nFor any compact oriented embedded (but not necessarily connected) submanifold\n\u03a3 \u2282 S2n\u22121 (1) \u2282 Cn define the cone on \u03a3,\nC(\u03a3) = {tx : t \u2208 R\u22650 , x \u2208 \u03a3}.\nA cone C in Cn (that is a subset invariant under dilations) is regular if there exists\n\u03a3 as above so that C = C(\u03a3), in which case we call \u03a3 the link of the cone C.\nC0 (\u03a3) := C(\u03a3) \u2212 {0} is an embedded smooth submanifold, but C(\u03a3) has an isolated\nsingularity at 0 unless \u03a3 is a totally geodesic sphere.\nLet r denote the radial coordinate on Cn and let X be the Liouville vector field\nn\n1 \u2202\n1X \u2202\n\u2202\nX= r\n=\nxj\n+ yj\n.\n2 \u2202r\n2\n\u2202xj\n\u2202yj\nj=1\n\nThe unit sphere S2n\u22121 inherits a natural contact form\n\u03b3 = \u03b9X \u03c9|S2n\u22121 =\n\nn\nX\nj=1\n\nxj dyj \u2212 yj dxj\n\nS2n\u22121\n\nfrom its embedding in Cn . A regular cone C in Cn is Lagrangian if and only if its link\n\u03a3 is Legendrian. We call a submanifold \u03a3 of S2n\u22121 special Legendrian if the cone\nover \u03a3, C0 (\u03a3) is special Lagrangian in Cn .\n\n2.4\n\nAsymptotically conical SL n\u2013folds and ACSL smoothings\n\nRoughly speaking, an asymptotically conical special Lagrangian n\u2013fold L (ACSL)\nin Cn is a nonsingular SL n\u2013fold which tends to a regular SL cone C at infinity.\nIn particular, if L is an ACSL submanifold then limt\u21920+ tL = C for some SL cone\nC. Hence ACSL submanifolds give rise to local models for how nonsingular SL\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1461\n\nsubmanifolds can develop isolated singularities modelled on the cone C. Conversely,\nas in [29], one can use ACSL submanifolds to desingularize SL conifolds.\nMore precisely, we say that a closed, nonsingular SL submanifold L of Cn is asymptotically conical (AC) with decay rate \u03bb < 2 and cone C if for some compact subset\nK \u2282 L and some T > 0, there is a diffeomorphism \u03c6 : \u03a3 \u00d7 (T, \u221e) \u2192 L \\ K such that\n(2\u20135)\n\n|\u2207k (\u03c6 \u2212 i)| = O(r\u03bb\u22121\u2212k ) as r \u2192 \u221e for k = 0, 1,\n\nwhere i(r, \u03c3) = r\u03c3 and \u2207 and | * | are defined using the cone metric g0 on C.\nGiven a regular SL cone C in Cn an important question is: does C admit an ACSL\nsubmanifold L asymptotic to the given SL cone C? We call this the asymptotically\nconical special Lagrangian smoothing problem for the SL cone C or for short the ACSL\nsmoothing problem.\nFrom the point of view of the global smoothing theory developed by Joyce in [29] it is\nnatural to ask whether C admits an ACSL smoothing with decay rate \u03bb \u2264 0. We call\nthis the ACSL smoothing problem with decay.\nWe will see shortly that neither version of the ACSL smoothing problem is always\nsolvable.\n\n2.5\n\nNonsmoothable SL singularities I\n\nSuppose that C is a SL cone with link \u03a3 for which the ACSL smoothing problem\nis solvable. Then clearly the smooth oriented manifold \u03a3 bounds a compact smooth\noriented manifold M . In other words, \u03a3 is oriented cobordant to the empty set. This is\na special case of the oriented version of the Cobordism Problem solved by Wall [50],\nfollowing the pioneering work of Thom in the unoriented case [49].\nWall determined the structure of the oriented cobordism ring \u03a9\u2217 = (\u03a90 , \u03a91 , \u03a92 , . . .)\n[50]. He showed that the oriented cobordism groups \u03a9n are trivial for n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 7\nand are nonzero in all other dimensions (see [41, page 203] for a table of \u03a9n up to\nn = 11). Hence for n \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 6, 7} any oriented n\u2013manifold \u03a3 bounds an oriented\n(n + 1)\u2013manifold L.\nMore generally, Wall [50, page 306] proved that [\u03a3] = 0 in the oriented cobordism ring\nif and only if all the Pontrjagin and Stiefel\u2013Whitney numbers of \u03a3 vanish (see Milnor\nand Stasheff [41, Chapters 4 and 16] for a definition of these characteristic numbers).\nFor instance it follows from (3\u20133) that CP2 does not bound any oriented 5\u2013manifold.\nOn the other hand, if all the Pontrjagin and Stiefel\u2013Whitney classes of T\u03a3 are zero\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1462\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nthen of course so are the Pontrjagin and Stiefel\u2013Whitney numbers. Hence every stably\nparallelizable manifold bounds.\nThus if we can find a SL cone C whose link \u03a3 is not nullcobordant then for purely\ntopological reasons neither version of the ACSL smoothing problem for C is solvable.\nWe will give such an example below and hence see that there is no obvious SL analogue\nof the Hardt\u2013Simon desingularization theorem for minimizing hypercones.\nTheorem 2.2 Let A denote an n \u00d7 n complex matrix. Define a map \u03c6 from SU(n) to\nSym(n, C), the symmetric n \u00d7 n complex matrices, by\n1\nA 7\u2192 \u221a AAT .\nn\nb on the quotient SU(n)/SO(n). The induced map\nThen \u03c6 passes to a well-defined map \u03c6\nb : SU(n)/SO(n) \u2192 Sym(n, C) gives a special Legendrian embedding of the quotient\n\u03c6\n\u03a3 = SU(n)/SO(n) into the unit sphere of Sym(n, C) (and hence the cone over \u03a3 is\nspecial Lagrangian).\nFor n = 3, \u03a3 = SU(3)/SO(3) does not bound any compact 6\u2013manifold and in particular\nthe ACSL smoothing problem with cone C = C(\u03a3) has no solutions.\nProof The fact that the above embedding is special Lagrangian was proven by Cheng\n[11, Theorem 1.2]. Audin showed that the Stiefel\u2013Whitney number w2 w3 (T\u03a3) = 1 6= 0\nfor n = 3 [5, page 191]. Since \u03a3 has a nonzero Stiefel\u2013Whitney number it does not\nbound any smooth 6\u2013manifold.\nRemark 2.3 In fact, Ohnita [43, Theorem 2.2] has recently studied the stability index\nof these (very symmetric) SL cones. He showed that the SL cone over SU(3)/SO(3) is\nstrictly stable in the sense of [23, 29]. Hence this SL cone would be a good candidate\nfor a \"common singularity type\". On the other hand what we have just said shows that\nthere can be no SL smoothings of X .\nNext we exhibit infinitely many SL cones for which there is no solution to the ACSL\nsmoothing problem with decay. These nonsmoothing results will also show that there are\nobstructions to the solvability of the ACSL smoothing problem beyond the cobordism\nclass of the link of the cone.\nFirst we need some auxiliary results on SL n\u2013folds with symmetry and moment maps.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n2.6\n\n1463\n\nG\u2013invariant SL submanifolds\n\nIn symplectic geometry continuous group actions which preserve \u03c9 are often induced\nby a collection of functions, the moment map of the action. We describe the situation in\nCn , where the situation is particularly simple.\nLet (M, J, g, \u03c9) be a K\u00e4hler manifold, and let G be a Lie group acting smoothly on\nM preserving both J and g (and hence \u03c9 ). This induces a linear map \u03c6 from the\nLie algebra g of G to the vector fields on M . Given x \u2208 g, let v = \u03c6(x) denote the\ncorresponding vector field on M . Since Lv \u03c9 = 0, it follows from Cartan's formula that\n\u03b9v \u03c9 is a closed 1\u2013form on M . If H 1 (M, R) = 0 then there exists a smooth function \u03bcx\non M , unique up to a constant, such that d\u03bcx = \u03b9v \u03c9 . \u03bcx is called a moment map for x,\nor a Hamiltonian function for the Hamiltonian vector field v. We can attempt to collect\nall these functions \u03bcx , x \u2208 g, together to make a moment map for the whole action. A\nsmooth map \u03bc : M \u2192 g\u2217 is called a moment map for the action of G on M if\n(i) \u03b9\u03c6(x) \u03c9 = hx, d\u03bci for all x \u2208 g\u2217 where h, i is the natural pairing of g and g\u2217 ;\n(ii) \u03bc : M \u2192 g\u2217 is equivariant with respect to the G\u2013action on M and the coadjoint\nG\u2013action on g\u2217 .\nIn general there are obstructions to a symplectic G\u2013action admitting a moment map.\nThe subsets \u03bc\u22121 (c) are the level sets of the moment map. The centre Z(g\u2217 ) is the\nsubspace of g\u2217 fixed by the coadjoint action of G. Property (ii) of \u03bc implies that a level\nset \u03bc\u22121 (c) is G\u2013invariant if and only if c \u2208 Z(g\u2217 ).\nWhen a moment map for a symplectic group action does exist, it is a very useful tool\nfor studying G\u2013invariant isotropic submanifolds of (M, \u03c9). Using property (i) above it\nis easy to see that any G\u2013invariant isotropic submanifold of (M, \u03c9) must be contained\nin some level set \u03bc\u22121 (c) of the moment map. Using property (ii) one can check that\nc \u2208 Z(g\u2217 ). Hence we have the useful fact that: any G\u2013invariant isotropic submanifold\nof (M, \u03c9) is contained in the level set \u03bc\u22121 (c) for some c \u2208 Z(g\u2217 ).\nThe group of automorphisms of Cn preserving g, \u03c9 and \u03a9 is SU(n) n Cn , where Cn\nacts by translations. Since Cn is simply connected, each element x in the Lie algebra\nsu(n) n Cn has a moment map \u03bcx : Cn \u2192 R. More concretely, we can describe these\nfunctions as follows: a function is said to be a harmonic Hermitian quadratic if it is of\nthe form\nn\nn\nX\nX\n(2\u20136)\nf =c+\n(bi zi + b\u0304i z\u0304i ) +\naij zi z\u0304j\ni=1\n\ni,j=1\n\nPn\n\nfor some c \u2208 R, bi , aij \u2208 C with aij = \u0101ji and i=1 aii = 0. A harmonic Hermitian\nquadratic with c = 0, aij = 0 for all i and j corresponds to the moment map of a\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1464\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\ntranslation. A harmonic Hermitian quadratic\n\u221a with c = 0, bi = 0 for all i corresponds\nto the moment map of the element A = \u22121 (aij ) \u2208 su(n). Moreover, these functions\nsatisfy conditions (i) and (ii) above, and thus give rise to a moment map for the whole\ngroup action.\nSince this group action also preserves the condition to be special Lagrangian, the\nrestriction to special Lagrangian submanifolds of the moment map of any su(n) n Cn\nvector field enjoys some special properties.\nLemma 2.4 (Joyce [32, Lemma 3.4] and Fu [14, Theorem 3.2]) Let \u03bc : Cn \u2192 R\nbe a moment map for a vector field x in su(n) n Cn . Then the restriction of \u03bc to any\nspecial Lagrangian n\u2013fold in Cn is a harmonic function on L with respect to the metric\ninduced on L by Cn .\nConversely, a function f on Cn is harmonic on every SL n\u2013fold in Cn if and only if\n(2\u20137)\n\nd(\u03b9Xf Im(\u03a9)) = 0\n\nwhere Xf = \u2212J\u2207f is the Hamiltonian vector field associated with f . For n \u2265 3, f\nsatisfies (2\u20137) if and only if f is a harmonic Hermitian quadratic.\nIn other words, any special Lagrangian n\u2013fold L in Cn automatically has certain\ndistinguished harmonic functions. We can use Lemma 2.4 together with the Maximum\nPrinciple to conclude that a compact special Lagrangian submanifold with boundary\ninherits all the symmetries of the boundary.\nProposition 2.5 (Haskins [23, Proposition 3.6]) Let Ln be a compact connected\nspecial Lagrangian submanifold of Cn with boundary \u03a3. Let G be the identity\ncomponent of the subgroup of SU(n) n Cn which preserves \u03a3. Then G admits a\nmoment map \u03bc : Cn \u2192 g\u2217 , both \u03a3 and L are contained in \u03bc\u22121 (c) for some c \u2208 Z(g\u2217 )\nand G also preserves L.\nHere is an asymptotically conical analogue of this result:\nProposition 2.6 (Haskins [23, Propostion B.1]) Let L be an ACSL submanifold L\nwith rate \u03bb and regular special Lagrangian cone C. Let G be the identity component of\nthe subgroup of SU(n) preserving C. Then\n(i) G admits a moment map \u03bc and C \u2282 \u03bc\u22121 (0);\n(ii) if \u03bb < 0, then L \u2282 \u03bc\u22121 (0) and G also preserves L;\n(iii) if \u03bb = 0 and L has one end, then L \u2282 \u03bc\u22121 (c) for some c \u2208 Z(g\u2217 ) and G\npreserves L.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1465\n\nThe following lemma shows that associated to any SL cone C there is a natural\n1\u2013parameter family of ACSL submanifolds Lt , asymptotic with rate \u03bb = 2 \u2212 n to\nthe union of the two SL cones C \u222a ei\u03c0/n C. Hence there always exist natural \"twoended\" desingularizations of any SL cone C. It may be useful to emphasize that this\nconstruction does not provide a solution to the ACSL smoothing problem for C, unless\nC is (ei\u03c0/n )\u2013invariant. Notice that this lemma is compatible with the fact that the\ndisjoint union of any oriented manifold \u03a3 together with \u2212\u03a3 is always nullcobordant.\nLemma 2.7 [23, Lemma B.3] Let C be any regular SL cone in Cn with link \u03a3.

Moreover, Lt\nhas the same symmetry group as C.\n\n2.7\n\nNonsmoothable SL singularities II\n\nProposition 2.6 and Lemma 2.7 show that any ACSL smoothing (with appropriate\ndecay) of a G\u2013invariant SL cone C is also G\u2013invariant, and that C has a canonical\n1\u2013parameter family of G\u2013invariant two-ended ACSL smoothings. For certain group\nactions G we will see that the only G\u2013invariant SLG n\u2013folds are the SL cones C\nthemselves and their canonical two-ended ACSL smoothings. Hence we will be able to\nprove that certain G\u2013invariant SL cones C admit no (one-ended) ACSL smoothings\n(with decay).\nThe following three infinite families of very symmetric SL cones have been studied\npreviously by a number of authors [10, 11, 42, 43].\nExample 2.8 For n \u2265 3, let gl(n, C) denote the space of all n \u00d7 n complex matrices\nequipped with the hermitian inner product hhA, Bii := Tr AB\u2217 , and let SU(n) act on\ngl(n, C) by (A, B) 7\u2192 AB.

Then the ACSL smoothing problem with decay is not solvable for\nthe cone C.\nProof For Example 2.8\u2013Example 2.10, Castro\u2013Urbano [10, Section 2] proved that the\nonly G\u2013invariant SL submanifolds (with the group G and its action as described in the\nexamples) are the cones themselves and their canonical two-ended ACSL smoothings.\nHowever, by Proposition 2.6(iii) any ACSL smoothing of C with decay rate \u03bb \u2264 0\nis also G\u2013invariant. Hence no such ACSL smoothing of C with decay rate \u03bb \u2264 0\nexists.\nHere is a way to think about why we should expect a result like Theorem 2.11 to hold.\nIn the examples above, the common feature is that we have a low cohomogeneity action\nof the nonabelian group G for which Z(g\u2217 ) = (0). Let \u03bc denote the associated moment\nmap. Then we know that all G\u2013invariant Lagrangian submanifolds are contained in\n\u03bc\u22121 (0). Thus there are rather few G\u2013invariant Lagrangian submanifolds for these\ngroups G.\nIf C is a G\u2013invariant SL cone and G has cohomogeneity one (as do the above examples)\nthen any ACSL smoothing with decay will also be G\u2013invariant with cohomogeneity\none. Thus to obtain (one-ended) ACSL smoothings of C it is necessary that there be\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1467\n\n\u03c9 \u2013isotropic orbits of G whose dimension is neither maximal (corresponding to the link\nof the cone) nor minimal (when the orbit is just the origin of Cn ). If isotropic orbits\ncannot collapse in this intermediate way then there is no way to obtain G\u2013invariant\none-ended ACSL n\u2013folds. For instance, in Example 2.8 it is easy to see that SU(n) acts\nfreely on \u03bc\u22121 (0), except at the origin. Hence all the G\u2013orbits in \u03bc\u22121 (0) except the\norigin are diffeomorphic to SU(n), and thus there are no \"intermediate\" isotropic orbits.\nHowever, if instead G is abelian, then any level set of the corresponding moment map\n\u03bc is G\u2013invariant, and not just the zero level set \u03bc\u22121 (0). Thus in the abelian case\nthere are many more G\u2013invariant Lagrangian submanifolds and many more isotropic\nG\u2013orbits. In particular, if G is the maximal abelian subgroup Tn\u22121 \u2282 SU(n) acting\nin the obvious way on Cn , then there are \"intermediate\" isotropic G\u2013orbits. As a\nresult the Tn\u22121 \u2013invariant SL cone C over the Legendrian Clifford torus T n\u22121 does\nadmit one-ended ACSL smoothings. In fact, one can classify all the one-ended ACSL\nsmoothings with decay of the Legendrian Clifford torus Tn\u22121 \u2282 S2n\u22121 this way; see\n[29, Section 10] for a detailed description of the n = 3 case.\nOne can use the same idea for other group actions G. Provided G is \"large enough\"\nthen we can expect to classify all G\u2013invariant SL n\u2013folds and hence to classify all\nACSL smoothings with decay of any such G\u2013invariant SL cone.\nIn Example 2.8 the link of the SL cone is diffeomorphic to SU(n). Since any Lie group\nis parallelizable, all its Pontrjagin and Stiefel\u2013Whitney classes vanish and hence it is\nnullcobordant. Hence we have infinitely many SL cones where there is no differentialtopological obstruction to smoothing the singularity, but which nevertheless admit no\nACSL smoothing (with decay).\nIn this case a natural weaker question to ask is: do the nullcobordant special Legendrian\nlinks \u03a3 above admit Lagrangian or Maslov-zero Lagrangian smoothings? We will see\nthat we can answer the immersed version of this question using a relative version of\nthe Gromov\u2013Lees h\u2013principle for Lagrangian immersions. We will see that in general\nthere are obstructions to Lagrangian smoothing that are of an algebro-topological nature\nwhich go beyond the cobordism type of the link.\nIn order to describe these obstructions we need to review the h\u2013principle for Lagrangian\nimmersions, beginning with the version for closed manifolds. Although much of\nthis material is well-known to symplectic topologists, we expect that many readers\nwhose background is in minimal submanifolds or special Lagrangian geometry will be\nunfamiliar with it.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1468\n\n3\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nThe h\u2013principle for Lagrangian immersions\nof closed manifolds\n\nLet Ln be a compact connected (not necessarily orientable) manifold without boundary.\nA natural question in symplectic geometry is:\nWhen does L admit a Lagrangian immersion into R2n ?\nGromov and Lees showed that Lagrangian immersions of closed manifolds satisfy the\nso-called h\u2013principle, where h stands for homotopy. The idea is that for a Lagrangian\nimmersion to exist certain conditions of an algebro-topological nature must be satisfied,\nand saying that the h\u2013principle holds for Lagrangian immersions means that these\nnecessary topological conditions are in fact sufficient.\nHence the previous, apparently geometric question about the existence of Lagrangian\nimmersions reduces to a topological problem which in many cases can be solved.\n\n3.1\n\nThe h\u2013principle for immersions of closed manifolds\n\nWe begin with a description of the h\u2013principle for immersions of a closed manifold, ie\nfor the moment we drop the Lagrangian condition. Let V and W be smooth manifolds of\ndimension n and q respectively. Suppose that n \u2264 q and that there exists an immersion\nf : V \u2192 W . Then the differential df : TV \u2192 TW is a smooth bundle map (ie a smooth\nmap which fibrewise is linear) which is injective on each fibre. This motivates the\nfollowing definition:\nDefinition 3.1 A monomorphism F : TV \u2192 TW is a smooth bundle morphism which\nis fibrewise injective. We will usually denote by f = bs(F) the underlying \"base map\"\nV \u2192 W . Notice that f is a smooth map, but it need not be an immersion.\nEliashberg and Mishachev [13] call such a monomorphism a formal solution of the\nimmersion problem. Clearly, the existence of a monomorphism F : TV \u2192 TW (a\nformal solution) is a necessary condition for the existence of an immersion f : V \u2192 W\n(a genuine solution). A monomorphism of the form F = df is also sometimes called\nholonomic. One says that a differential relation R (eg the immersion relation) satisfies\nthe h\u2013principle if every formal solution of R (a monomorphism TV \u2192 TW in our case)\nis homotopic in the space of formal solutions to a genuine solution of R (an immersion\nV \u2192 W ). Hirsch [27] extending work of Smale [46] proved that the h\u2013principle\nholds for the differential relation associated with immersions of a closed n\u2013manifold\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1469\n\nV into a q\u2013manifold W provided q > n. In the case where V is an n\u2013manifold and\nW = Rq we know from the results of Whitney [52] that any smooth n\u2013manifold (n > 1)\ncan be immersed in Rq for any q \u2265 2n \u2212 1. In particular, this gives a very indirect\nargument that we must always be able to construct a monomorphism from TV to TRq ,\nfor q \u2265 2n \u2212 1 whatever the n\u2013manifold V . Perhaps more importantly it shows that\nthe Smale\u2013Hirsch h\u2013principle is (in the case of immersions into Euclidean space) of\ngreatest interest in the case of relatively low codimension.\n\n3.2\n\nThe h\u2013principle for Lagrangian immersions\n\nTo understand the statement of the h\u2013principle for Lagrangian immersions first we\nhave to understand what the appropriate notion of a formal solution to the Lagrangian\nimmersion problem is.\nSuppose as in the previous section that V and W are smooth manifolds of dimension\nn and q respectively and that q > n. Any monomorphism F : TV \u2192 TW induces a\nnatural map GF : V \u2192 Grn (W), where Grn (W) denotes the Grassmannian bundle of\nn\u2013planes in W . In particular, for any immersion f : V \u2192 W we have an associated\n(tangential) Gauss map written Gdf . If (W, \u03c9) is a symplectic manifold then one\ncan define a number of natural subbundles of the Grassmannian n\u2013plane bundles. In\nparticular, if q = 2n we can define the subset Grlag (W) of all Lagrangian n\u2013planes in\n(W, \u03c9). Clearly, if f : V n \u2192 (W 2n , \u03c9) is a Lagrangian immersion then the image of\nthe associated (tangential) Gauss map Gdf is contained in the subbundle Grlag (W) of\nGrn (W).\n+\nSimilarly, one can also define a subbundle Gr+\nlag (W) \u2282 Grn (W) corresponding to\nthe set of all oriented Lagrangian planes inside the set of all oriented n\u2013planes. If\nf : V n \u2192 (W 2n , \u03c9) is a Lagrangian immersion of an oriented manifold V then the\nassociated Gauss map Gdf is contained in Gr+\nlag (W). Similarly, if (W, J) is an almostcomplex manifold then there are other natural subbundles of the Grassmannian n\u2013plane\nbundles. For instance, a linear subspace S of a complex vector space (W, J) is totally\nreal if JS \u2229 S = (0). Hence, in an almost complex manifold (W 2n , J) there is a\nsubbundle Grreal (W) \u2282 Grn (W) such that any totally real immersion f : V n \u2192 (W 2n , J)\nhas tangential (Gauss) map Gdf contained in Grreal (W). If J and \u03c9 are compatible then\nGrlag (W) \u2282 Grreal (W), so that any Lagrangian immersion is totally real. The converse\nis false. There is also an oriented version of this totally real Grassmannian bundle.\n\nDefinition 3.2 Let V be a smooth (not necessarily orientable) n\u2013manifold and let (W, \u03c9)\nbe a symplectic 2n\u2013manifold. A Lagrangian monomorphism F is a monomorphism\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1470\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nF : TV \u2192 TW such that GF(V) \u2282 Grlag (W). Similarly, one can define a totally real\nmonomorphism in an almost-complex manifold (W, J) by replacing Grlag (W) with\nGrreal (W).\nA Lagrangian monomorphism is the correct notion of a formal solution of the Lagrangian\nimmersion problem. For the case of Lagrangian immersions of closed manifolds into\n(R2n , \u03c9) with its standard symplectic structure the following version of the h\u2013principle,\ndue to Gromov [17] and Lees [38], holds.\nTheorem 3.3 (Lagrangian h\u2013principle for closed manifolds) Let L be a smooth\nclosed n\u2013manifold. Suppose there is a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n .\nThen there exists a family of Lagrangian monomorphisms Ft : [0, 1] \u00d7 TL \u2192 TR2n\nsuch that F0 = F and F1 is holonomic; ie F1 = def . In particular, the base map\nbs(F1 ) = ef : L \u2192 Cn is a Lagrangian immersion. Furthermore, ef is exact.\nRemark 3.4 (Exactness of the resulting Lagrangian immersion) Let f : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n\nbe an immersion of a manifold \u03a3k , of dimension k \u2264 n. Recall that f is said to be\nan exact immersion if theR1\u2013form f \u2217 \u03bb is exact, ie f \u2217 \u03bb = dz, for some z \u2208 C\u221e (\u03a3, R).\nEquivalently f is exact if \u03b3 f \u2217 \u03bb = 0 for all closed curves \u03b3 in \u03a3. Since \u03c9 = d\u03bb, any\nexact immersion is automatically \u03c9 \u2013isotropic.\nIf f is \u03c9 \u2013isotropic, f \u2217 \u03bb is a closed 1\u2013form on \u03a3 and the class [f \u2217 \u03bb] \u2208 H 1 (L; R) is\ncalled the symplectic area class of the isotropic immersion f . The isotropic immersion\nf is exact if and only if the symplectic area class of f vanishes. Hence any Lagrangian\nimmersion of a simply connected manifold is exact. Also, any Lagrangian submanifold\nis \"locally exact\" near any smooth point, because any closed 1\u2013form is locally exact. In\nSection 6 we will see that this is also true near certain types of isolated singularities.\nThere is an important reformulation of the condition that an immersion f : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n be\nexact; f is exact if and only if it can be lifted to an immersion in R2n+1 which is isotropic\nwith respect to its standard contact structure \u03b1 = dz \u2212 \u03bb. In particular, (up to constants)\nthere is a one-to-one correspondence between exact Lagrangian immersions in (R2n , \u03c9)\nand Legendrian immersions in (R2n+1 , \u03b1). The proof of Theorem 3.3 rests on the fact\nthat any Lagrangian monomorphism into R2n lifts to a Legendrian monomorphism into\nR2n+1 ; one can then apply the corresponding result for Legendrian monomorphisms;\nsee [13, Section 16.1.3]. Hence the previous observation explains why the Lagrangian\nimmersion that we obtain from the h\u2013principle in Theorem 3.3 must be exact.\nRecall that two Lagrangian immersions are said to be regularly homotopic if there\nexists a homotopy through Lagrangian immersions. We will also need the following\nparametric version of the Lagrangian h\u2013principle (also due to Gromov and Lees).\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1471\n\nTheorem 3.5 (Parametric Lagrangian h\u2013principle) Let f0 , f1 : L \u2192 R2n be Lagrangian immersions. If the monomorphisms F0 := df0 and F1 := df1 are homotopic\nthrough Lagrangian monomorphisms, then they are also homotopic through holonomic\nLagrangian monomorphisms; ie f0 and f1 are regularly homotopic.\nRemark 3.6 Notice that if f0 , f1 are exact, a proof of Theorem 3.5 can be obtained\nalong the same lines as before: we can lift the curve of Lagrangian monomorphisms\nFs into R2n+1 and get a curve of Legendrian monomorphisms which are holonomic\nfor s = 0 and s = 1. The parametric Legendrian h\u2013principle now yields a curve\nof holonomic Legendrian monomorphisms which coincide with the given ones for\ns = 0 and s = 1; this curve projects back down to R2n yielding the desired curve of\nholonomic Lagrangian monomorphisms.\nIf f0 and/or f1 are not exact, the proof is more complicated. One first needs to prove\nthe equivalent of Theorem 3.3 for general exact ambient spaces (N, \u03c9 = d\u03b1). Then\none proves an analogue of Theorem 3.5 for exact f0 , f1 : L \u2192 N and s\u2013dependent\n1\u2013forms \u03b1s (this time we lift the given data into N \u00d7 R endowed with the appropriate\ns\u2013dependent contact structure). It turns out, using the parametric h\u2013principle for\nimmersions, that the problem of Theorem 3.5 is equivalent to the following.\nLet N 2n be a rank n vector bundle over L, endowed with a curve of exact symplectic\nforms \u03c9s = d\u03bbs for s \u2208 [0, 1]. Let i : L \u2192 N be the zero section and \u03c0 : N \u2192 L be\nthe projection. Assume we are given a curve of monomorphisms Fs : TL \u2192 TN such\nthat Fs is Lagrangian with respect to \u03c9s and F0 = F1 = di. Then Fs can be homotoped,\nrel s = 0 and s = 1, to a curve of holonomic Lagrangian monomorphisms.\nes\nThe proof of this last claim is rather simple. Let us choose a curve of closed 1\u2013forms \u03bb\n\u2217\nes . Notice that\nwhich coincide with \u03c0 (\u03bbs |i(L) ) when s = 0 and s = 1. Let \u03b1s := \u03bbs \u2212 \u03bb\nd\u03b1s = \u03c9s so the symplectic structure has not changed and the Fs are still Lagrangian.\nHowever F0 = di and F1 = di are now exact with respect to the 1\u2013forms \u03b1s , so we\ncan apply the simpler parametric h\u2013principle seen above.\nRemark 3.7 (Regular homotopies vs Hamiltonian isotopies) Suppose f : Ln \u2192 R2n\nis a nonexact Lagrangian immersion. Since df is a Lagrangian monomorphism, we can\nfirst apply Theorem 3.3 to find an exact immersion ef ; we can then apply Theorem 3.5\nto prove that f is regularly homotopic to ef . There is however a finer classification of\nLagrangian immersions than that given by the regular homotopy classes, namely the\nclassification up to Hamiltonian isotopy. The condition that a Lagrangian immersion\nbe exact or nonexact is invariant under Hamiltonian isotopy. This shows that using\nthe h\u2013principle to perturb a given Lagrangian submanifold will typically change the\nHamiltonian isotopy class of that submanifold.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1472\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nRemark 3.8 (Lagrangian and totally real embeddings) It is natural to ask whether\nthe h\u2013principle also holds for Lagrangian embeddings and not just immersions. By\nWhitney's hard embedding theorem any smooth n\u2013manifold L admits an embedding\ninto R2n . There is, however, a simple topological obstruction to a closed n\u2013manifold\nadmitting a Lagrangian embedding in R2n which we now describe.\nSuppose that Ln admits a Lagrangian embedding into R2n . The self-intersection number\nof any compact submanifold Ln of R2n is zero since we may use translations to disjoin\nL from itself. Since L is embedded we can identify a neighbourhood of L \u2282 R2n\nwith a neighbourhood of L inside its normal bundle NL; thus the Euler number of\nthe normal bundle of L is also zero. Since the Lagrangian condition allows us to\nidentify NL with TL, this proves that the Euler number of the tangent bundle of L, ie\nthe Euler characteristic of L, must also be zero. This shows, for example, that the only\norientable surface which could admit a Lagrangian embedding into R4 is the torus T 2 ,\nand the product S1 \u00d7 S1 \u2282 C \u00d7 C gives such a Lagrangian embedding. Notice that we\ncannot conclude anything from this Euler characteristic information about Lagrangian\nembeddings of closed orientable 3\u2013manifolds in R6 , and in particular of S3 .\nIn fact, Gromov proved that Lagrangian embeddings do not satisfy the h\u2013principle,\nas an application of his theory of J \u2013holomorphic curves in symplectic manifolds\n[16]. In particular, he proved that there are no exact Lagrangian embeddings of closed\nn\u2013manifolds in (R2n , \u03c9). For example, there is no Lagrangian embedding of S3 in R6 .\nThis also shows that if we apply Theorem 3.3 to perturb a (nonexact) embedded\nLagrangian submanifold, the resulting exact Lagrangian submanifold will typically only\nbe immersed. On the other hand, there are totally real embeddings of S3 in R6 . In\nfact both totally real immersions and totally real embeddings satisfy versions of the\nh\u2013principle (see Gromov [17] or Eliashberg and Mishachev [13, Section 19.3.1, Section\n19.4.5]).\n\n3.3\n\nExistence and classification of Lagrangian immersions\n\nAs we have just seen, the h\u2013principle reduces questions about the existence of Lagrangian\nimmersions to questions about the existence of Lagrangian monomorphisms. In this\nsection we show that it suffices to prove the existence of totally real monomorphisms;\nthis last problem has a straightforward solution which leads to a classification of\nLagrangian immersions in terms of topological data.\nSince TR2n = R2n \u00d7 R2n , we can think of any monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n as\nthe data (f , \u03c6), where f : L \u2192 R2n is the underlying base map and \u03c6 : TL \u2192 R2n is a\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1473\n\nfibrewise injective homomorphism. In what follows we will often use \u03c6 to pull back\nthe standard metric g on R2n , obtaining a metric \u03c6\u2217 g on TL.\nLet us start by showing that totally real monomorphisms are closely related to the\ncomplexified tangent bundle TLC ; as usual, we will say that TLC is trivial if there exists\na complex vector bundle isomorphism (a complex trivialization) TLC ' L \u00d7 Cn . Any\nmap \u03c6 as above has a natural complexification \u03c6C : TLC \u2192 R2n , defined by\n\u03c6C (v + iw) := \u03c6(v) + J\u03c6(w)\nwhere J is the standard complex structure on R2n .\nLemma 3.9 There is a one-to-one correspondence between totally real injections\nTL \u2192 R2n and trivializations of TLC .\nProof Let \u03c6 : TL \u2192 R2n be a fibrewise linear map. We will first show that \u03c6 is totally\nreal if and only if \u03c6C : TLC \u2192 R2n is a complex isomorphism (with respect to J ).\nSince \u03c6C is a complex linear map between complex spaces of the same dimension, it\nsuffices to show surjectivity of \u03c6C . But \u03c6C is surjective at p \u2208 L if and only if the two\nreal n\u2013planes \u03c6(Tp L) and J\u03c6(Tp L) in R2n intersect transversally, ie if and only if \u03c6\nis a totally real monomorphism. Hence any totally real injection naturally induces a\ncomplex trivialization of TLC .\nConversely, any complex trivialization \u03c6C : TLC \u2192 L \u00d7 Cn determines a unique totally\nreal injection \u03c6 : TL \u2192 Cn defined by \u03c6 := \u03c6C \u25e6 i where i : TL \u2192 TLC denotes the\nnatural (totally real) inclusion of TL in TLC .\nLemma 3.9 indicates the existence of a distinguished subset of trivializations of TLC :\nthe ones obtained by complexifying Lagrangian injections TL \u2192 Cn . In Lemma 3.15\nwe will refer to these as the Lagrangian trivializations of TLC .\nEven though Lagrangian monomorphisms form a proper subset of the set of all totally\nreal monomorphisms (analogously, the Lagrangian trivializations are a proper subset of\nthe set of all trivializations of TLC ), Corollary 3.12 below will show that the difference\nbetween these two categories disappears when one works in terms of homotopy classes.\nThis is a direct consequence of the following result.\nLemma 3.10 (Polar decomposition) There exists a strong deformation retraction\n\u03c1 : GL(n, C) \u00d7 I \u2192 GL(n, C) onto U(n) which is equivariant with respect to U(n)\u2013\nmultiplication on the left or the right; ie\n\u03c1t (AM) = A\u03c1t (M), \u03c1t (MA) = \u03c1t (M)A, for all A \u2208 U(n), M \u2208 GL(n, C), t \u2208 [0, 1].\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1474\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nProof The standard polar decomposition theorem proves\nof a unique\n\u221a the existence\n+\n\u2217\ndecomposition M = PU with U \u2208 U(n) and P = MM \u2208 P , where P +\ndenotes the set of positive self-adjoint matrices. Note if P \u2208 P + then the matrix\nPt := t Id + (1 \u2212 t)P \u2208 P + . Let us define \u03c1t (M) := Pt U . Clearly \u03c10 (M) = M and\n\u03c11 (M) = U , so \u03c1t is a strong retraction as claimed. Now suppose that A is in U(n).\nThe equivariance of \u03c1t with respect to the right action of U(n) is easy to see. To show\ne , where P\ne := APA\u22121\nthe left-equivariance, notice that AM = APU = APA\u22121 AU = PAU\nis positive self-adjoint and AU \u2208 U(n).

For completeness,\nwe provide here the details.\nLet F = (f , \u03c6). For any p \u2208 L, let {vi }ni=1 be an orthonormal basis of Tp L (with\nrespect to the pullback metric on L induced by F ). Let M = M(p) denote the matrix\nexpressing the homomorphism \u03c6C : Tp LC \u2192 Cn in terms of the basis {vi } of Tp LC and\nthe standard basis of Cn . Since F is totally real, M \u2208 GL(n, C). Define Mt := \u03c1t (M)\nwhere \u03c1 is the retraction defined in the Lemma 3.10. Mt gives a homotopy through\nGL(n, C) matrixes between M and the matrix L := \u03c11 (M) \u2208 U(n). We now define\n\u03c6t : Tp L \u2192 Cn to be the homomorphism corresponding to the matrix Mt , and hence\nobtain a one-parameter family of monomorphisms Ft := (f , \u03c6t ). Since Mt \u2208 GL(n, C)\ne := F1 is\nand L \u2208 U(n), Ft (for t \u2208 [0, 1)) are totally real monomorphisms and F\na Lagrangian monomorphism (furthermore, the pullback metrics induced by F, F1\ncoincide). Notice that if we begin with a different orthonormal basis {w1 , . . . , wn }\nthen wi = vj aji for some A = (aij ) \u2208 O(n); now \u03c6 gives rise to the matrix MA and\nhence, by the right-equivariance of \u03c1, \u03c61 corresponds to LA. Hence the construction is\ne is well-defined. Since all this also\nindependent of the choice of basis of Tp L, so that F\nworks parametrically, it also proves the second statement.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1475\n\nRemark 3.13 The same methods apply to show that polar decomposition induces a\nnatural retraction from Grreal (R2n ) to Grlag (R2n ). Using the U(n)\u2013invariance of polar\ndecomposition mentioned in Lemma 3.10 these results can be extended to totally real\nmonomorphisms from TL into any symplectic ambient manifold (W, \u03c9) endowed with\na compatible almost-complex structure J and metric g. The proof is as above: we\nchoose an orthonormal basis vi for Tp L and a unitary basis ei for Tf (p) W and reduce\nthe question to matrices, then prove that the result is independent of the choice of both\nsets of bases using the left and right equivariance of polar decomposition.\nHence we have the following result:\nCorollary 3.14 Let L be a closed smooth (not necessarily orientable) n\u2013manifold.\nThen the following conditions are equivalent.\n(1) L admits a Lagrangian immersion f : L \u2192 R2n .\n(2) TLC is trivial.\n(3) L admits a totally real monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n .\n(4) L admits a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n .\nFurthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the homotopy classes of the\nabove objects.\nProof Notice that there is an obvious map from the set I of regular homotopy\nclasses of Lagrangian immersions to the set M of homotopy classes of Lagrangian\nmonomorphisms, namely,\nI \u2192 M, [f ] 7\u2192 [df ].\nTheorem 3.3 shows that this map is surjective; this also proves the equivalence between\nstatements (1) and (4). Theorem 3.5 shows that this map is injective. Corollary 3.12\nproves the equivalence of (3) and (4) and of their homotopy classes. To prove the\nequivalence between (2) and (3), let (f , \u03c6) be a totally real monomorphism. Lemma 3.9\nthen proves that \u03c6 defines a complex trivialization of TLC . Conversely, given \u03c6 we\ncan use any smooth map f : L \u2192 R2n (eg a constant map) to obtain a totally real\nmonomorphism (f , \u03c6). Since R2n is topologically trivial all such f are homotopic, so\nthe correspondence between homotopy classes is simple.\nCorollary 3.14 part (2) thus completely solves the \"Lagrangian immersion in R2n\nproblem\" for closed manifolds in terms of a topological condition on L. There is one\nlast thing we can do, which is to classify these homotopy classes. This is based on the\nfollowing simple fact.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1476\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nLemma 3.15 Any given trivialization \u03c60 of TLC induces a bijective correspondence\nbetween the set of all trivializations of TLC and the set of all maps L \u2192 GL(n, C).\nTwo trivializations are homotopic if and only if the corresponding maps are homotopic.\nFurthermore we have the following:\n(1) Let h and g denote the standard Hermitian and Riemannian metrics on Cn . Then\nthe above correspondence, restricted to the set of maps L \u2192 U(n), yields the\nset of all other trivializations whose pullback Hermitian metric \u03c6\u2217 h on TLC\ncoincides with \u03c6\u22170 h.\n(2) Now assume \u03c60 is a Lagrangian trivialization of TLC (as defined above). Then\nthe above correspondence, restricted to the set of maps L \u2192 U(n), yields the set\nof all other Lagrangian trivializations whose pullback Riemannian metric \u03c6\u2217 g\non TL coincides with \u03c6\u22170 g.\nProof For i = 0, 1 let \u03c6i : TLC \u2192 L \u00d7 Cn be complex trivializations of TLC . Then\nn\nn\n\u03c61 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n0 : L \u00d7 C \u2192 L \u00d7 C is a fibrewise complex isomorphism, or equivalently,\nn\na map from L into Aut(C ). We identify Aut(Cn ) with GL(n, C) by choosing the\nstandard basis e1 , . . . , en of Cn . We write the map L \u2192 GL(n, C) determined by \u03c60\nand \u03c61 (and the choice of our standard basis for Cn ) as M\u03c61 ,\u03c60 . Hence if we choose a\nreference trivialization \u03c60 of TLC , then any other trivialization \u03c6 of TLC determines a\nmap L \u2192 GL(n, C), namely M\u03c6,\u03c60 . Conversely, a map M : L \u2192 GL(n, C) determines\na fibrewise complex-linear automorphism A(M) of L \u00d7 Cn , and hence another complex\nM\ntrivialization of TLC , denoted \u03c6M\n0 and given by \u03c60 := A(M) \u25e6 \u03c60 .\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\nNow let vi := \u03c6\u22121\n0 ei . Notice that \u03c6 h = \u03c60 h if and only if \u03c6 h(vi , vj ) = \u03c60 h(vi , vj ).\n\u2217\nHowever, the left hand side of this last expression is (\u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n0 ) h(ei , ej ) while the right\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhand side is h(ei , ej ), so we conclude that \u03c6 h = \u03c60 h if and only if \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n0 is unitary,\nie M\u03c6,\u03c60 \u2208 U(n). This proves (1). Now recall that h = g + i\u03c9 , so if \u03c60 is Lagrangian\nthen \u03c6\u22170 h = \u03c6\u22170 g. In this case \u03c6\u2217 h = \u03c6\u22170 h if and only if \u03c6\u2217 h = \u03c6\u22170 g; in particular this\nimplies that \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 = 0, ie that \u03c6(TL) is Lagrangian in Cn , and that \u03c6\u2217 g = \u03c6\u22170 g. This\nproves (2).\n\nWe can now classify the homotopy classes of Lagrangian immersions as follows (cf [5,\npage 274]).\nProposition 3.16 Given a Lagrangian immersion L \u2192 Cn , the set of regular homotopy\nclasses of all Lagrangian immersions L \u2192 Cn (or of homotopy classes of Lagrangian\nmonomorphisms) is in bijective correspondence with the set [L; U(n)] of homotopy\nclasses of maps from L into U(n) (or equivalently into GL(n, C)).\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1477\n\nProof Corollary 3.14 allows us to rephrase the statement in terms of Lagrangian\nmonomorphisms; the proof of Corollary 3.14 shows that all base maps are homotopic,\nallowing us to further reduce to Lagrangian trivializations of TLC . We can now prove the\nstatement as follows. The given Lagrangian immersion defines a reference Lagrangian\ntrivialization \u03c60 and a pullback metric \u03c6\u22170 g on TL. Choose another Lagrangian\ntrivialization \u03c6; for any point p \u2208 L, let \u03c0p denote the image Lagrangian plane in\nCn , with the metric induced from g. Then \u03c6(p) : Tp L \u2192 \u03c0p is an isomorphism, and\nby the real polar decomposition lemma (see Remark 3.11) it can be homotoped to an\ne (as in Corollary 3.12) without changing the image plane \u03c0p . Since \u03c6\ne has\nisometry \u03c6\nC\ne still defines a Lagrangian trivialization of TL ; thus part (2) of\nthe same image \u03c0p , \u03c6\ne corresponds to a map L \u2192 U(n).\nLemma 3.15 shows that \u03c6\n\n3.4\n\nGauss maps and the Maslov class\n\nTo simplify the discussion, in this section we will assume that L is oriented; at the end\nof the section we will add a few comments on the nonorientable case.\n2n\n2n which has fibre\nSince R2n is contractible, Gr+\nlag (R ) is a trivial bundle over R\nU(n)/SO(n). Hence given any Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n the\ntangential Gauss map GF gives us a map\n\nGF : L \u2192 U(n)/SO(n).\nMore explicitly, fix x \u2208 L and consider the homomorphism Fx : Tx L \u2192 Cn . We can\nuse any positive orthonormal basis {vi }ni=1 (with respect to the pullback metric) of\nTx L and the standard basis of Cn to represent Fx via a matrix in U(n). This matrix\ndepends on the choice of {vi } but its equivalence class in U(n)/SO(n) does not; this is\nthe Gauss map GF(x). Composition with the complex determinant yields an associated\ndeterminant map\ndetC \u25e6 GF : L \u2192 S1 .\nThis construction induces a well-defined map \u03bc on the set of homotopy classes M of\nLagrangian monomorphisms, which we call the Maslov map \u03bc : M \u2192 [L; S1 ] and is\ngiven by\n\u03bcF := [detC \u25e6 GF].\nWhen the Lagrangian monomorphism F arises from an oriented Lagrangian immersion\nthen the determinant map defined above coincides with the Lagrangian phase function\nei\u03b8 defined in Section 2.2.\nWe now recall some well-known facts about homotopy classes of maps to S1 . Since S1\nis an abelian Lie group the homotopy classes of maps into S1 inherit the structure of an\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1478\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nabelian group. We will let d\u03b8 denote the standard harmonic 1\u2013form on S1 , normalized\nso that [d\u03b8] is the generator of H 1 (S1 , Z) ' Z.\nLemma 3.17 For any CW complex K the map [K; S1 ] \u2192 H 1 (K, Z) induced by\nf 7\u2192 f \u2217 [d\u03b8]\nis an isomorphism of abelian groups. Also, there is an isomorphism between H 1 (K,Z)\nand Hom(\u03c01 (K), Z). In particular, a map f : K \u2192 S1 is homotopic to a constant if and\nonly if f |\u03b3 is homotopic to a constant, for all closed loops \u03b3 \u2282 K .\nProof If K is any CW complex and Y is an Eilenberg\u2013Mac Lane space of type\nK(\u03c0, n), there is a natural isomorphism between the homotopy classes of maps [K; Y]\nand H n (K; \u03c0) [7, Theorem VII.12.1]. The first part now follows since S1 is an\nEilenberg\u2013Mac Lane space K(Z, 1). From the Universal Coefficient Theorem we have\nH 1 (K, Z) ' Hom(H1 (K), Z) + Ext(H0 (K), Z) [7, page 282]. Since H0 (K) is always\nfree, we have H 1 (K, Z) ' Hom(H1 (K), Z) ' Hom(\u03c01 (K), Z) since Z is abelian.\nUsing Lemma 3.17 we can identify \u03bcF with the element (detC \u25e6 GF)\u2217 [d\u03b8] \u2208 H 1 (L, Z);\nthis is the Maslov class of F . Furthermore, \u03bcF is equivalent to a homomorphism\nmF : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 Z. Given a loop \u03b3 : S1 \u2192 L, mF ([\u03b3]) \u2208 Z simply calculates the degree\nof the map detC \u25e6 GF \u25e6 \u03b3 : S1 \u2192 S1 ; we call this integer the Maslov index of the curve\n\u03b3 . Notice that according to Corollary 3.14 we can always represent \u03bcF by a Lagrangian\nimmersion f in the same homotopy class; we will then use the notation \u03bcf . We now\nwant to describe a second way to compute \u03bcF , along the lines of Proposition 3.16. Let\nus fix a Lagrangian monomorphism F0 = (f0 , \u03c60 ). As explained in Proposition 3.16,\nany other Lagrangian monomorphism F = (f , \u03c6) can be homotoped so that f = f0 (see\nthe proof of Corollary 3.14) and the induced pullback metrics \u03c6\u2217 g, \u03c6\u22170 g on TL coincide,\nso F will correspond to a map MF,F0 : L \u2192 U(n).\nLemma 3.18 In the situation just described, \u03bcF = [detC MF,F0 ] * \u03bcF0 , where * denotes\ngroup multiplication in the abelian group [L; S1 ]. In particular, if F0 has zero Maslov\nclass then \u03bcF = [detC MF,F0 ].\nProof Let F0 = (f , \u03c60 ) and F = (f , \u03c6). Fix p \u2208 L; let {vi }ni=1 be an orthonormal\nbasis of Tp L with respect to \u03c6\u22170 g. Let M(\u03c60 ), M(\u03c6) be the matrices expressing \u03c6C\n0 and\n\u03c6C with respect to the basis {vi } of Tp LC and the standard basis of Cn . Notice that\n\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6C . Thus det \u25e6 GF = det M(\u03c6) = det M\n\u03c6C = \u03c6C \u25e6 (\u03c6C\nC\nC\nC F,F0 * (detC \u25e6 GF0 ) so\n0)\n0\n\u03bcF = [detC MF,F0 ] * \u03bcF0 .\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1479\n\nProposition 3.19 Let L be a closed orientable n\u2013manifold L with TLC trivial, and let\n\u03bc be an arbitrary element of H 1 (L, Z).\n(1) L admits a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TCn with \u03bcF = \u03bc.\n(2) L admits an exact Lagrangian immersion f : L \u2192 R2n with \u03bcf = \u03bc.\nProof Since TLC is trivial there exists at least one Lagrangian monomorphism\nF0 : TL \u2192 TR2n which we can fix as our reference monomorphism. As in Lemma 3.15,\nall other such monomorphisms are determined (up to homotopy) by maps from L to\nU(n) and the corresponding Maslov classes can be calculated as in Lemma 3.18. The\ninclusion S1 ,\u2192 U(n), given by\nei\u03b8 7\u2192 diag (ei\u03b8 , 1, . . . , 1)\nshows that any map L \u2192 S1 is the determinant of some map L \u2192 U(n); in other words,\nthe map\n[L, U(n)] \u2192 [L, S1 ] ' H 1 (L, Z)\ninduced by detC is surjective. Thus for any \u03bc \u2208 H 1 (L, Z) we can find M : L \u2192 U(n)\nsuch that \u03bc = [detC M] * \u03bcF0 . Let F be the Lagrangian monomorphism determined by\nF0 and M . It follows from Lemma 3.18 that \u03bcF = \u03bc as required.\nThe second statement is a direct consequence of the Lagrangian h\u2013principle.\nIt follows from Proposition 3.19 that in the orientable case there are no extra obstructions\nto finding Maslov-zero monomorphisms (or immersions).\nIt is an interesting issue how one can use information on the Gauss map to study a\ngiven Lagrangian monomorphism. To investigate this, let us introduce a new way of\nthinking about Lagrangian trivializations. Let \u03c6 : TLC \u2192 L \u00d7 Cn be a Lagrangian\ntrivialization. Let SO(L) denote the bundle of positive orthonormal frames on L induced\nby the pullback metric. Recall that SO(L) is a SO(n)\u2013principal fibre bundle over L with\nrespect to the right action of SO(n) defined as follows: if (v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2208 SO(L) and\nA \u2208 SO(n), then (v1 , . . . , vn ) * A := (w1 , . . . , wn ) where wi := vj aji . We will denote by\np : SO(L) \u2192 L the obvious projection.\nThere is a natural map\n\u03a6 : SO(L) \u2192 U(n),\n\n(v1 , . . . , vn ) \u2208 p\u22121 (x) 7\u2192 \u03a6(v1 , . . . , vn )\n\nwhere \u03a6(v1 , . . . , vn ) is the matrix which represents \u03c6x with respect to the basis\n(v1 , . . . , vn ) and the standard basis of Cn . This map is SO(n)\u2013equivariant with respect\nto the action of SO(n) on U(n) determined by right multiplication. Denote the natural\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1480\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nprojection by q : U(n) \u2192 U(n)/SO(n). Notice that the Gauss map satisfies the relation\np \u25e6 G\u03c6 = \u03a6 \u25e6 q. In other words, \u03a6 is a map between the principal fibre bundles\nSO(L) and U(n) which covers the corresponding Gauss map on the base spaces L and\nU(n)/SO(n).\nMore generally, any Lagrangian trivialization inducing the same metric defines an\nequivariant map SO(L) \u2192 U(n). Furthermore, it is clear that this procedure defines a\none-to-one correspondence between all such trivializations and all such maps. This correspondence respects homotopy classes in the following sense: two such trivializations\nare homotopic if and only if the corresponding maps are homotopic.\nNotice that a given map L \u2192 U(n)/SO(n) is a Gauss map if and only if it admits a lift\nto an equivariant map SO(L) \u2192 U(n). It follows from the general theory of principal\nfibre bundles that the existence of such lifts is a homotopically invariant property: if\ng : L \u2192 U(n)/SO(n) is a Gauss map, ie g = G\u03c6, and g is homotopic to g0 then g0\nis the Gauss map of some \u03c60 and the corresponding \u03a6, \u03a60 are themselves homotopic\nthrough equivariant maps SO(L) \u2192 U(n). We can use this as follows.\nDefinition 3.20 Let GrSL (Cn ) denote the Grassmannian of special Lagrangian planes\n2n\nin Cn ; it is a trivial subbundle of Gr+\nlag (R ), with fibre SU(n)/SO(n). A Lagrangian\nmonomorphism F is special Lagrangian if its Gauss map takes values in GrSL (Cn ).\nSL monomorphisms are the obvious formal analogue of SL immersions.\nProposition 3.21 Let L be an oriented manifold. Then any Maslov-zero monomorphism F is homotopic through Lagrangian monomorphisms to an SL monomorphism\nF0 .\nProof Write F = (f , \u03c6) and let \u03a6 denote the corresponding equivariant map from\nSO(L) to U(n) (with respect to the induced metric). Recall that U(n) ' S1 \u00d7 SU(n)\nand that U(n)/SO(n) ' S1 \u00d7 SU(n)/SO(n). Thinking of G\u03c6 as a map from L to\nS1 \u00d7SU(n)/SO(n), we see that F is Maslov-zero if and only if G\u03c6 is homotopic to a map\ng0 : L \u2192 SU(n)/SO(n). By the homotopic invariance of the lifting property, g0 is the\nGauss map of some \u03a60 homotopic to \u03a6. By construction, \u03a60 is a map SO(L) \u2192 SU(n);\nthe corresponding monomorphism F 0 = (f , \u03c60 ) is a SL monomorphism homotopic to\nF.\nFrom the viewpoint of SL geometry, this proposition justifies our interest in Maslov-zero\nmonomorphisms and immersions. It also shows that there are no extra obstructions\nto finding SL monomorphisms. However there do exist strong obstructions to finding\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1481\n\nSL immersions. For example, since Cn contains no closed minimal submanifolds,\nunder our assumptions (L compact) there cannot exist SL immersions f : L \u2192 Cn . In\nparticular this shows that SL monomorphisms do not satisfy an h\u2013principle.\nWe conclude this section with a few comments on the nonorientable case. The\nnonoriented Lagrangian Grassmannian has fibre U(n)/O(n), so to get a well-defined\ndeterminant map it is necessary to replace detC with det2C . Unoriented analogues of the\nMaslov map, the Maslov class and the Maslov index of a curve can then be defined as\nbefore. The following lemma shows that if the unoriented Maslov data of a Lagrangian\nmonomorphism F : TLC \u2192 Cn satisfies certain conditions then in fact L must be\norientable.\nLemma 3.22 Suppose that L (not assumed to be orientable) admits a Lagrangian\nmonomorphism F : TLC \u2192 Cn such that the (unoriented) Maslov index\nmF (\u03b3) := deg(det2C \u25e6 GF \u25e6 \u03b3)\nof every loop \u03b3 in L is even. Then L is orientable.\nProof Consider the two-to-one covering map p : U(n)/SO(n) \u2192 U(n)/O(n) obtained\nby forgetting the orientation of an oriented Lagrangian n\u2013plane in R2n . One can show\nthat p\u2217 (\u03c01 (U(n)/SO(n)) is an index two subgroup of \u03c01 (U(n)/O(n)) isomorphic to\n2Z \u2282 Z. By standard covering space theory the map GF : L \u2192 U(n)/O(n) lifts to the\ntwo-fold cover U(n)/SO(n) if and only if GF\u2217 \u03c01 (L) \u2286 p\u2217 \u03c01 (U(n)/SO(n)). But this is\nequivalent to the fact that the Maslov index of every loop in L is even. Hence GF lifts\nto a map GF + : L \u2192 U(n)/SO(n), and this gives an orientation of each tangent space\nof L as needed.\nAn immediate corollary of the previous Lemma is the following:\nCorollary 3.23 Suppose L admits a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TLC \u2192 Cn such\nthat det2C GF : L \u2192 S1 is homotopic to a constant. Then L is orientable, and the\ncorresponding oriented Gauss map is Maslov-zero.\nThe above shows that Proposition 3.19 cannot hold for closed nonorientable manifolds\nL; in particular, 0 \u2208 H 1 (L, Z) cannot be realized as a Maslov class of any nonorientable\nmanifold. The analogous result, which can be proved via the same methods, is as\nfollows.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1482\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nProposition 3.24 Let L be a closed, nonorientable manifold. Assume TLC is trivial,\nso that there exists a Lagrangian monomorphism F with (unoriented) Maslov class\n\u03bcF \u2208 H 1 (L, Z). Then any other Lagrangian monomorphism from L has Maslov class\nin the set 2H 1 (L, Z) + \u03bcF \u2282 H 1 (L, Z), and any such cohomology class can be realized\nthis way.\n\n3.5\n\nExamples\n\nWe conclude this section by using Corollary 3.14 to give examples of manifolds which\ndo and do not admit Lagrangian immersions into R2n .\n3.5.1\n\nLow-dimensional cases\n\nFor n \u2264 3, one can use the previous results to give a very good description of which\nclosed n\u2013manifolds admit Lagrangian immersions into Cn and to describe the regular\nhomotopy classes of Lagrangian immersions.\nn = 1 In this case L = S1 and any immersion of L into C is Lagrangian. Let us fix\none immersion f0 : S1 \u2192 C. As explained in Lemma 3.15, any other immersion f\nnow defines an element in [S1 ; U(1)] = \u03c01 (U(1)) = Z, ie an integer. Notice that the\nGauss maps take values in the Grassmannian U(1)/SO(1) ' S1 and that detC = Id.\nChoosing f0 to have zero-Maslov class is equivalent to making Gdf0 homotopically\ntrivial; for example, we could choose f0 to be a \"figure eight curve\" inside C. With\nsuch a choice of f0 the above integer is the turning number of f in C. Hence the\nclassification of regular homotopy classes of Lagrangian immersions of S1 in C given\nby Proposition 3.16 reduces to Whitney's classification of immersions of S1 in R2\naccording to their turning number.\nn = 2 Let L be a closed surface, not necessarily orientable. In this case one can show\nthat the complexified tangent bundle TLC is trivial if and only if the Euler characteristic\n\u03c7(L) is even [5, page 274]. Hence by Corollary 3.14 every orientable surface admits\nLagrangian immersions in C2 , while if L is the connected sum of k copies of RP2 then\nit admits Lagrangian immersions into C2 if and only if k is even. For example, RP2\nhas no Lagrangian immersions into C2 , while the Klein bottle K does.\nIn the oriented case, let us now fix one such immersion. Recall from the proof of\nProposition 3.19 that the map [L; U(2)] \u2192 [L; S1 ] induced by detC is surjective. Since\nthe map detC : U(n) \u2192 S1 induces isomorphisms on \u03c01 and \u03c02 , it follows using\ntechniques similar to those of Section 4.4 that in dimension 2 this map is also injective\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1483\n\n[7, Corollary VII.11.13]. Hence the map M 7\u2192 (detC M)\u2217 [d\u03b8] induces a bijection\nfrom [L; U(2)] to H 1 (L, Z). In other words, for any closed oriented surface we can\nstrengthen Proposition 3.19 as follows: the regular homotopy class of the immersion f\nis completely determined by \u03bc.\nn = 3 We shall assume that L is a closed orientable 3\u2013manifold. In this case,\nit is a theorem originally stated by Stiefel that L is parallelizable [41, page 148].\nComplexification gives an obvious complex parallelization of L. Hence any closed\norientable 3\u2013manifold admits exact Lagrangian immersions into C3 . In the special\ncase where L = S3 then the regular homotopy classes of Lagrangian immersions are in\none-to-one correspondence with \u03c03 (U(3)) = Z. In particular, unlike the case of curves\nand surfaces, the Maslov class of a Lagrangian immersion f of L3 no longer determines\nits regular homotopy class. However, one can prove that there is a bijection between\n[L; U(3)] and H 1 (L, Z)\u00d7H 3 (L, Z) [2, Proposition 1].\nOn the other hand, it is easy to find nonorientable closed 3\u2013manifolds which do not\nadmit Lagrangian immersions; RP2 \u00d7 S1 is probably the simplest example.\n\n3.5.2\n\nManifolds with trivial or stably trivial tangent bundles\n\nIn the previous example we saw that if there exists a trivialization of TL then complexification gives an obvious trivialization of TLC . Hence any closed parallelizable\nn\u2013manifold admits Lagrangian immersions into Cn . In particular any compact Lie\ngroup admits Lagrangian immersions into Cn and so do the spheres and real projective\nspaces in dimensions 1, 3 and 7 (which are well-known to be the only parallelizable\nspheres or projective spaces). More generally, one can show that if TL is only stably\nparallelizable (ie the direct sum of TL with some trivial bundle is itself trivial) then TLC\nis still trivial [5, page 273]. As we have already mentioned, any embedded hypersurface\nin Rn+1 has this property. This gives an alternative proof that any compact orientable\nsurface admits Lagrangian immersions into R4 . It also proves that Sn admits Lagrangian\nimmersions into R2n for any n (on the other hand we will see that for most n, RPn\ndoes not admit Lagrangian immersions). Furthermore, the regular homotopy classes of\nLagrangian immersions are in one-to-one correspondence with [Sn , U(n)] = \u03c0n (U(n)),\nwhich equals 0 or Z depending on whether n is even or odd respectively.\nThere are many more stably parallelizable manifolds than parallelizable manifolds. For\nexample, the class of stably parallelizable manifolds is closed under taking products\nand connected sums [35, page 187] and also contains all manifolds which are homotopy\nspheres [35, page 191].\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1484\n\n3.5.3\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nNonexistence of Lagrangian immersions via characteristic classes\n\nOne can sometimes give simple proofs of Lagrangian nonimmersion results by characteristic class arguments. Below we give representative examples of this type of argument\nusing the Stiefel\u2013Whitney and Pontrjagin classes of TL.\nGiven any real vector bundle Er \u2192 L over any closed manifold Ln , one can define\nStiefel\u2013Whitney classes wi (E) \u2208 H i (L; Z/2), with w0 (E) = 1 [41, Section 4]. w(E) :=\nw0 (E) + * * * + wr (E) is called the total Stiefel\u2013Whitney class of the bundle. Recall that\nw(E) has the following fundamental properties: w(E \u2295 F) = w(E) * w(F) and, if E is\ntrivial, then w(E) = 1. The total Stiefel\u2013Whitney class of TRPn is well-known to be\nw(RPn ) = (1 + a)n+1 ,\n\n(3\u20131)\n\nwhere a denotes the nonzero element of H 1 (RPn , Z/2) which under cup product\ngenerates the full Z/2 cohomology ring of RPn [41, Theorem 4.5]. As unoriented real\nvector bundles TLC ' TL \u2295 TL. Hence if TLC is trivial, then w(TL)2 = 1. Using\n(3\u20131) it is straightforward to show that w(RPn )2 = 1 if and only if n + 1 is a power of\n2. Hence there are no Lagrangian immersions of RPn in Cn unless n = 2k \u2212 1 for\nsome k \u2208 Z. For k = 1, 2, 3 we already saw in Section 3.5.2 that such Lagrangian\nimmersions do exist.\nThe Pontrjagin classes of a real vector bundle Er \u2192 L may be obtained from the Chern\nclasses of its complexification E \u2297R C. The standard definition of the i\u2013th Pontrjagin\nclass is pi (E) := (\u22121)i c2i (E \u2297 C) \u2208 H 4i (L, Z) [41, page 174]. The total Pontrjagin\nclass p(E) is defined to be\n(3\u20132)\n\np(E) = 1 + p1 (E) + . . . + p[n/2] (E) \u2208 H \u2217 (L).\n\nThe class p(E) equals the total Chern class of E \u2297 C, ignoring the odd Chern classes\nc2i+1 (E \u2297 C) which vanish in de Rham cohomology and are order 2 in the integral\ncohomology (Bott and Tu give a different definition of p(E) which does not ignore\nthese odd Chern classes [6, page 289]). If the complex vector bundle E \u2297 C is trivial,\nthen from the basic properties of Chern classes we have p(E) = 1. In particular, if L\nadmits a Lagrangian immersion in R2n then TLC is trivial and hence p(TL) = 1. For\ninstance, the total Pontrjagin class of CPn is well-known [41, page 177] to be\n(3\u20133)\n\np(CPn ) = (1 + a2 )n+1 = 1 + (n + 1)a2 + . . .\n\nwhere a \u2208 H 2 (CPn ; Z) generates H \u2217 (CPn ; Z) under cup product. In particular,\np(CPn ) 6= 1 for n > 1, and hence admits no Lagrangian immersions in C2n . For an\noriented 4\u2013manifold M there is only one nontrivial Pontrjagin class p1 (M) \u2208 H 4 (M, Z)\nand hence only one Pontrjagin number p1 [M] := hp1 (TM), [M]i \u2208 Z. If \u03a3d is\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1485\n\na nonsingular algebraic hypersurface of degree d > 0 in CP3 , then a standard\ncharacteristic class computation (see Donaldson and Kronheimer [12, Section 1.1.7])\nshows that the Pontrjagin number of \u03a3d is given by\np1 [\u03a3d ] = (4 \u2212 d2 )d.\n\n(3\u20134)\n\nIn particular, \u03a3d does not admit Lagrangian immersions into C4 unless d = 2, in\nwhich case \u03a32 ' S2 \u00d7 S2 which is stably parallelizable and hence admits a Lagrangian\nimmersion.\n\n4\n\nPrescribed Boundary Problem\n\nWe now turn to Lagrangian immersions of compact manifolds with boundary. Specifically, we will prescribe an immersion along the boundary \u03a3n\u22121 and try to find a\n\"Lagrangian filling\" of this data. In Section 4.2 we will describe this \"Prescribed\nBoundary Problem\" more precisely. In Section 4.1 we begin with a preliminary, related\nquestion. Throughout this section, our focus will be on the orientable case.\n\n4.1\n\nPreliminary considerations\n\nLet \u03a3n\u22121 be a compact oriented (not necessarily connected) manifold without boundary,\nand i : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n be an immersion. Consider the following question.\nLagrangian Cobordism Problem Does there exist a compact oriented n\u2013manifold\nL bounding \u03a3 and a Lagrangian immersion f : L \u2192 R2n extending i : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n ?\nOur main interest is actually in a stronger version of this question, which we call\nthe Prescribed Boundary Problem. Our goal now is thus not to solve the Lagrangian\nCobordism Problem, but simply to highlight some of the restrictions that it imposes on\n\u03a3 and i.\nTopological restrictions The first question is whether \u03a3 bounds any compact oriented\nsmooth manifold L. As we have already discussed in Section 2.5 this is equivalent to\nthe vanishing of all the Pontrjagin and Stiefel\u2013Whitney numbers of \u03a3.\nThe second topological issue is that L must admit Lagrangian immersions. As in\nSection 3, it is easy to prove that this implies that TLC must be trivial. The existence of\nsuch an L is an additional constraint on \u03a3.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1486\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nGeometric restrictions Suppose that we have overcome the topological restrictions\ndescribed above, ie \u03a3 bounds some compact n\u2013manifold L with TLC trivial. If there\nexists a Lagrangian immersion f : Ln \u2192 R2n which extends i : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n then i must\nbe isotropic, ie i\u2217 \u03c9 = 0. Thus, from now on we assume that i is an isotropic immersion.\n\nA second necessary condition on i comes from cohomological considerations. First\nconsider the following:\nExample 4.1 For dimensional reasons, any immersion i : S1 \u2192 R4 is isotropic.\nAssume i admits an oriented Lagrangian extension f : L \u2192 R4 . Then by Stokes'\nTheorem,\nZ\nZ\nZ\ni\u2217 \u03bb =\n\nf \u2217\u03bb =\n\nS1\n\nS1\n\nf \u2217 \u03c9 = 0,\n\nL\n\nso i is exact. For instance, this shows the isotropic immersion i : S1 \u2192 C2 given by\ni(ei\u03b8 ) = (ei\u03b8 , 0)\ndoes not admit any oriented Lagrangian filling.\nMore generally, suppose i admits an oriented Lagrangian extension f : L \u2192 R2n . Then,\nfor any\nR closed curve \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3 which is homologically trivial in L, Stokes' Theorem shows\nthat \u03b3 \u03bb = 0. Another way of saying this is as follows. If \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3 is homologically\ntrivial in L, there exists \u03b1 \u2208 H2 (L, \u03a3) such that \u2202\u03b1 = \u03b3 . On the other hand, since i is\nisotropic any extension f defines an element [f \u2217 \u03c9] in the relative de Rham cohomology\nH 2 (L, \u03a3). If f is Lagrangian then [f \u2217 \u03c9] = 0. By duality this occurs if and only if\nhf \u2217 \u03c9, \u03b1i = 0 for all \u03b1 \u2208 H2 (L, \u03a3). Now, using the particular \u03b1 defined above, we see\nthat\nZ\nZ\n\u03bb=\nf \u2217 \u03c9 = hf \u2217 \u03c9, \u03b1i = 0.\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b1\n\nThis condition is not automatic from the fact that i is an isotropic immersion.\nHowever\nR if we assume that the immersion i is not merely isotropic but exact, then we\nhave \u03b3 \u03bb = 0 for any closed curve \u03b3 in \u03a3. Example 4.1 shows that when n = 2 (and\n\u03a3 is connected) exactness is actually a necessary condition. Moreover, we will see\nthat (as in the closed case) Lagrangian submanifolds with boundary produced using\nthe relative version of the Lagrangian h\u2013principle are automatically exact and hence\nso are their boundaries. Thus, if we want to make use of the relative h\u2013principle then\nthe exactness of \u03a3 is a necessary assumption and not a mere convenience. Finally,\nwhen we come to apply our results on the Prescribed Boundary Problem to Lagrangian\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1487\n\ndesingularization problems we will find that the local geometry near the singular points\noften forces \u03a3 to be exact and not just isotropic.\nHence from now on we make the following assumptions about \u03a3.\nAssumptions about \u03a3\nA. \u03a3 bounds a compact oriented manifold L.\nB. TLC is trivial.\nC. The immersion i : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n is exact.\n\n4.2\n\nLagrangian thickenings and the Prescribed Boundary Problem\n\nIn Section 6 we investigate the existence of Lagrangian smoothings of a singular\nLagrangian object with only isolated singular points. We attempt to find our Lagrangian\nsmoothings by removing a small neighbourhood U of a singular point and gluing in a\nsmooth Lagrangian immersion of some compact manifold L with boundary \u03a3 := \u2202U .\nTo ensure smoothness of the new submanifold along the boundary \u2202U we need to\nmodify the Lagrangian Cobordism Problem by assigning as initial data, instead of just\n\u03a3, a neighbourhood of \u03a3 to be \"filled\" by L.\nFollowing [13, 17] let us introduce the notation Op \u03a3 to denote some open neighbourhood\nof \u03a3 \u2282 L, which can be varied as appropriate by restriction to a smaller neighbourhood\nof \u03a3. In our applications we will usually choose Op \u03a3 to be topologically [0, \u000f) \u00d7 \u03a3.\nDefinition 4.2 Let Ln be a compact connected oriented manifold with oriented boundary\n\u03a3, such that TLC is trivial. Let f : Op \u03a3 \u2192 R2n be an exact Lagrangian immersion of an\nopen neighbourhood of \u03a3 \u2282 L into R2n . We say that the triple (\u03a3, L, f ) is (exact) initial\ndata for the Prescribed Boundary Problem. A solution to the Prescribed Boundary\nProblem with initial data (\u03a3, L, f ) is any exact Lagrangian immersion bf : L \u2192 R2n\nwhich agrees with f on some (possibly smaller) open neighbourhood of \u03a3.\nRemark 4.3 As in Remark 3.7, it will follow from (the parametric version of)\nTheorem 4.6 below that any Lagrangian immersion bf : L \u2192 Cn which agrees with the\ninitial data (\u03a3, L, f ) on some neighbourhood of \u03a3 is regularly homotopic to an exact\nLagrangian immersion with the same initial data. For this reason there is no loss of\ngenerality in incorporating exactness directly into the definition of \"solution\".\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1488\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nAny solution of the Prescribed Boundary Problem yields a solution of the Lagrangian\nCobordism Problem, defined by setting i = f |\u03a3 . The prescription of a neighbourhood\nof \u03a3 adds however an important cohomological constraint to the problem, as follows.\nAssume for simplicity that Op \u03a3 ' [0, \u000f) \u00d7 \u03a3. Notice that the initial data (let us call\nit a \"Lagrangian thickening\" of i) determines a Maslov class \u03bcf \u2208 [\u03a3 \u00d7 [0, \u000f), S1 ] '\n[\u03a3, S1 ] ' H 1 (\u03a3, Z) defined, as before, via the corresponding Gauss map Gdf . Now\nsuppose that (L, bf ) is a solution to the induced Lagrangian Cobordism Problem. If (L, bf )\nalso solves the Prescribed Boundary Problem, then in particular the Maslov classes \u03bcf\nand \u03bcbf must satisfy\ni\u2217 \u03bcbf = \u03bcf ,\nwhere i\u2217 : H 1 (L, Z) \u2192 H 1 (\u03a3, Z) is the map induced by the inclusion \u03a3 \u00d7 [0, \u000f) \u2282 L.\nHence, the choice of initial data f with a different Maslov class \u03bcf will impose a\ndifferent condition on \u03bcbf but will not change the induced Lagrangian Cobordism\nProblem.\nIn particular, we see that if a solution to the Prescribed Boundary Problem does exist\nthen \u03bcf must belong to the image of i\u2217 . Thus for example if \u03bcf 6= 0 and H 1 (L, Z) = 0,\nthe Prescribed Boundary Problem will not admit solutions even though by hypothesis\nthe Lagrangian Cobordism Problem does (eg we could use \u03a3 = S1 and L = D2 ).\nThe above argument supposes that the same \u03a3 can support many different Lagrangian\nthickenings, with different Maslov classes. One can think of several different constructions to show that this is indeed true. Two of the simplest are outlined in the examples\nbelow. Notice that since Lagrangian thickenings have the same topology as \u03a3, they are\nexact if and only if \u03a3 is.\nExample 4.4 If the isotropic immersion i : \u03a3n\u22121 \u2192 R2n is not just smooth but real\nanalytic, we can produce Lagrangian thickenings of i as follows. Let L := (\u2212\u000f, \u000f) \u00d7 \u03a3.\nThen, for \u000f sufficiently small, and any ei\u03b8 \u2208 S1 , an application of Cartan\u2013K\u00e4hler theory\nproves that there exists a unique \u03b8 \u2013special Lagrangian immersion of L extending i [22,\nTheorem III.5.5].\nExample 4.5 Suppose i is actually a Lagrangian immersion of \u03a3 into Cn\u22121 so that it\ndefines a Maslov class \u03bci \u2208 [\u03a3, S1 ]. Let f be a Lagrangian thickening of i in Cn and\n\u03bcf \u2208 [\u03a3, S1 ] be its Maslov class. For example, if f : \u03a3 \u00d7 [0, \u000f) \u2192 Cn is the \"cylindrical\nthickening\" of i given by\n(x, t) 7\u2192 (i(x), t)\nthen \u03bcf = \u03bci . On the other hand, if i is real analytic then Example 4.4 shows how to\nbuild Maslov-zero thickenings of i. This shows that the same i may admit Lagrangian\nthickenings with different Maslov classes.\n\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n4.3\n\n1489\n\nThe Prescribed Boundary Problem and the relative h\u2013principle\n\nOur main tool to solve the Prescribed Boundary Problem described in Definition 4.2\nwill again be the Gromov\u2013Lees h\u2013principle, but this time in its relative form.\nTheorem 4.6 (Lagrangian h\u2013principle, relative version, Eliashberg and Mishachev\n[13, Section 6.2.C, Section 16.3.1]) Suppose \u03a3 = \u2202L and that there exists a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n which is holonomic over an open neighbourhood Op \u03a3 of \u03a3 \u2282 L; ie F = (f , \u03c6), where \u03c6 satisfies \u03c6|Op \u03a3 = df |Op \u03a3 . Assume\nfurthermore that f |Op \u03a3 is exact. Then there exists a family of Lagrangian monomorphisms Ft : [0, 1] \u00d7 TL \u2192 TR2n such that F0 = F , Ft |Op \u03a3 = F0 |Op \u03a3 and F1 is\nholonomic; ie F1 = def . In particular, the base map bs(F1 ) = ef : L \u2192 R2n is a\nLagrangian immersion with the prescribed boundary data f |Op \u03a3 . Furthermore, ef is\nexact.\nRemark 4.7 Theorem 4.6 still holds without assuming orientability of \u03a3 or L.\nRemark 4.8 As in the closed case, the proof of the relative h\u2013principle for Lagrangian\nimmersions relies on lifting the Lagrangian monomorphism to a Legendrian one in\nR2n+1 and applying the relative h\u2013principle for Legendrian immersions; again this\nexplains why the resulting Lagrangian immersion is exact. However, in order to apply\nthe Legendrian h\u2013principle we need this lift to be holonomic on Op \u03a3 : this explains\nthe extra assumption in the statement.\nTheorem 4.6 shows that to solve the Prescribed Boundary Problem with exact initial\ndata, the only obstruction one needs to overcome is the construction of a Lagrangian\nmonomorphism with the prescribed initial data. The triviality condition on TLC is not\nsufficient to guarantee that such monomorphisms exist: the boundary data imposes an\nadditional constraint, which we formalize as follows.\nDefinition 4.9 Let (\u03a3, L, f ) be initial data for the Prescribed Boundary Problem. A\ntrivialization TLC \u2192 L \u00d7 Cn is compatible with the initial data if it extends the\ntrivialization of T(Op \u03a3)C induced by df C .\nThe theory now proceeds exactly as in Section 3. In particular, the following statement\ncan be proved using those same methods.\nCorollary 4.10 Let (\u03a3, L, f ) be exact initial data for the Prescribed Boundary Problem.\nThen the following conditions are equivalent.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1490\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\n(1) The Prescribed Boundary Problem with initial data (\u03a3, L, f ) admits a solution.\n(2) TLC admits a compatible trivialization.\n(3) L admits a totally real monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n which extends df .\n(4) L admits a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TR2n which extends df .\nFurthermore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the homotopy classes of the\nabove objects. In particular, if a solution to the Prescribed Boundary Problem exists,\nit induces a bijective correspondence between the set of all compatible trivializations\nof TLC and the set of all maps L \u2192 GL(n, C) which map a neighbourhood of \u03a3 to\nthe identity matrix. Two trivializations are homotopic if and only if the corresponding\nmaps are homotopic.\nThe theory is not yet completely satisfactory: we would still like a constructive procedure\nto verify the existence of compatible trivializations. To this end, let (\u03a3, L, f ) be initial\ndata for the Prescribed Boundary Problem. Notice that since R2n is contractible there is\nno obstruction to extending f to a smooth map bf : L \u2192 R2n ; we can thus fix one such\nextension bf and use it as the base map for all our monomorphisms.\nLet us now fix a reference trivialization F0 = (bf , \u03c60 ) of TLC (not necessarily compatible\nwith the initial data). As seen in Lemma 3.15 this choice determines a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between all other trivializations of TLC and maps L \u2192 GL(n, C).\nIn particular, df C determines a map Mdf C ,F0 : Op \u03a3 \u2192 GL(n, C). The proof of the\nfollowing result is a direct consequence of Definition 4.9.\nLemma 4.11 (Existence of compatible trivializations) There exists a trivialization\ncompatible with the initial data (\u03a3, L, f ) if and only if the map M := Mdf C ,F0 from\nOp \u03a3 to GL(n, C) determined by df C and by the choice of reference trivialization F0\nb : L \u2192 GL(n, C).\ncan be extended to a map M\nRemark 4.12 The existence of a compatible trivialization should be independent of\nany choices made in the construction of the matrix-valued map M ; in particular if we\nchange the reference trivialization we will obtain a different map M 0 , and M should be\nextensible if and only if M 0 is. Notice that the change of trivialization will be described\nby a matrix-valued map defined on the whole L; using this it is simple to see that the\nabove indeed holds.\nIn other words, the fact that TLC is trivial allows us to translate the Prescribed Boundary\nProblem into an extension problem for maps into GL(n, C). In Section 4.4 we will\ndescribe a standard obstruction theory framework for dealing with such extension\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1491\n\nproblems using algebraic topology, following the treatments in Bredon [7] and Hatcher\n[26]. In the meantime we extend the definitions and results of Section 3.4 to manifolds\nwith boundary.\nGiven a manifold with boundary L and a Lagrangian monomorphism F : TL \u2192 TCn , we\ndefine its Gauss map GF : L \u2192 U(n)/SO(n) and determinant map detC \u25e6GF : L \u2192 S1\nexactly as before. This allows us to continue to use the same definition also for\nthe Maslov map \u03bc : M \u2192 [L, S1 ] ' H 1 (L, Z), where again M denotes the set of\nhomotopy classes of Lagrangian monomorphisms.\nLemma 4.13 Let L be a compact oriented n\u2013manifold with boundary. Suppose TLC\nis trivial and fix a reference Lagrangian monomorphism F0 . Then, for any other\nLagrangian monomorphism F (homotoped so that the corresponding matrix map MF,F0\ntakes values in U(n)), \u03bcF = [detC MF,F0 ] * \u03bcF0 . In particular, if F0 has zero Maslov\nclass then \u03bcF = [detC MF,F0 ].\nFurthermore, let \u03bc be an arbitrary element of H 1 (L, Z). Then L admits a Lagrangian\nmonomorphism F : TL \u2192 TCn with \u03bcF = \u03bc. Finally, any Maslov-zero Lagrangian\nmonomorphism can be homotoped to a SL monomorphism.\nProof The proofs are exactly the same as those of Lemma 3.18, Proposition 3.19 and\nProposition 3.21.\nNotice that the second part of Proposition 3.19 does not extend so easily because the\nh\u2013principle for manifolds with boundary requires additional assumptions about the\nmonomorphism near the boundary. Fortunately the above Lemma will be sufficient for\nour purposes.\nExample 4.14 Concerning the nonorientable case, suppose for example that L is the\nM\u00f6bius strip. Recall that L is a subset of the Klein bottle K , which from Section 3.5\nhas TK C trivial; thus TLC is trivial. The analogue of Proposition 3.24 for nonorientable\nmanifolds with boundary shows that the set of unoriented Maslov classes of L must\nbe either 2Z or 2Z + 1 inside H 1 (L, Z) ' Z. However, since L is nonorientable, 0\ncannot be a Maslov class so the subset realized by Maslov classes is 2Z + 1 \u2282 Z.\n\n4.4\n\nThe Extension Problem and obstruction theory\n\nLet (\u03a3, L, f ) be initial data for the Prescribed Boundary Problem. By Lemma 4.11 the\nexistence of a trivialization compatible with the initial data (in the sense of Definition 4.9)\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1492\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nis equivalent to the extensibility to L of a map M : Op \u03a3 \u2192 GL(n, C). In this section\nfirst we recall a standard approach to the abstract extension problem for continuous\nmaps of topological spaces. Then we apply these results to prove various existence and\nnonexistence results for compatible trivializations.\nLet A be a subspace of the topological space X and let M : A \u2192 Y be a continuous\nmap. The Extension Problem asks:\nb : X \u2192 Y?\nExtension Problem When can M be extended to a continuous map M\nIt is not always possible to give a continuous extension of M . For example, take\n(X, A) = (Dn+1 , Sn ) and Y = Sn . Then M extends to Dn+1 if and only if the class\n[M] = 0 \u2208 \u03c0n (Sn ) \u2261 Z. In particular, M : Sn \u2192 Sn extends to Dn+1 if and only\nif deg(M) = 0. Thus there is a homotopy-theoretic obstruction to extending M . If\nwe keep (X, A) = (Dn , Sn\u22121 ) and use Y = GL(n, C), then this is simplest case of\ninterest in Lemma 4.11. Once again M : Sn\u22121 \u2192 GL(n, C) extends to Dn if and only\nif [M] = 0 \u2208 \u03c0n\u22121 (GL(n, C)). In particular, if n is odd then this homotopy group\nvanishes (see below) and hence from Corollary 4.10 and Lemma 4.11 we obtain:\nCorollary 4.15 If n is odd, then the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable for any\ninitial data of the form (Dn , Sn\u22121 , f ).\nOn the other hand, if n is even, then \u03c0n\u22121 (GL(n, C)) = Z. For the case n = 2, we will\nshow in the next section that the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable if and only if\nthe Maslov class of the initial data (D2 , S1 , f ) is zero; see Theorem 5.4 for this result in a\nslightly more general context. This is again a homotopy-theoretic obstruction to solving\nthe Prescribed Boundary Problem. Furthermore, since Sn\u22121 is simply connected for\nn \u2265 3, we see that these obstructions will be sensitive to more than the Maslov class of\nthe initial data.\nNote For the remainder of this section a map between two topological spaces means a\ncontinuous map even if we do not say so explicitly.\nNow we would like to understand the Extension Problem for more general pairs (X,A).\nIn the simple extension problems considered above the extensibility of M depended\nonly on the homotopy class of M . It is natural to ask if this is always the case.\nAn equivalent reformulation of this question is: given two homotopic maps M0 and\nb 0 : X \u2192 Y of M0 , is there always an extension\nM1 from A to Y and an extension M\nb 1 : X \u2192 Y of M1 which is homotopic to M\nb 0 ?

However, under\nrather mild assumptions on (X, A) we get the much stronger conclusion that (X, A)\nsatisfies the homotopy extension property with respect to any space Y [7, VII.1.1]. For\nexample, if (X, A) is a CW-pair, ie A is a subcomplex of a CW-complex X , then the\nhomotopy extension property holds for any space Y and hence the Extension Problem\nis a homotopy-theoretic one [7, Corollary VII.1.4].\nIf, in addition, the space Y is path-connected and simple (that is, \u03c01 (Y, y0 ) acts trivially\non \u03c0n (Y, y0 ) for all y0 \u2208 Y and n \u2265 1) then one can use a Postnikov decomposition of\nY [7, page 501] to solve the Extension Problem as follows:\nTheorem 4.16 (Extension/Obstruction Theorem [7, page 507]) Let (X, A) be a CWpair and Y be path-connected and simple and let M : A \u2192 Y be a (continuous) map.\nThen there exists a sequence of obstructions\nn+1\ncn+1\n(X, A; \u03c0n (Y)),\nM \u2208H\n\nn \u2265 1,\n\n(where cn+1\nM is defined only when all the previous obstructions vanish and depends on\nthe previous liftings made) such that there is a solution of the Extension Problem for\nM if and only if there is a complete sequence of obstructions cn+1\nall of which are\nM\nb 1 and M\nb 2 are two different extensions of M then there exists a\nzero.

It is a classical result of J H C Whitehead [51] (see also\nMilnor and Stasheff [41, page 240]) that a smooth compact manifold with boundary\ncan be triangulated as a simplicial complex with the boundary as a subcomplex. In\nparticular, (L, \u2202L) is a CW-pair. Furthermore, the space Y will be a connected Lie group,\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1494\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nin which case Y is known to be simple [47, pages 88\u201389], and hence Theorem 4.16\napplies. For the application of obstruction theory to Lemma 4.11 and the construction\nof compatible trivializations we are interested in the case where Y = GL(n, C); the\nretraction GL(n, C) \u2192 U(n) allows us, from now on, to concentrate on the case\nY = U(n).\nFor our applications of Theorem 4.16 we are only interested in \u03c0i (U(n)) for i \u2264 n.\nThese fall within the \"stable range\" where [(i + 2)/2] \u2264 n and hence by Bott Periodicity\nare equal to 0 when n is even and Z when n is odd [7, pages 467\u20138]. Hence we have\nthe following immediate corollary of Theorem 4.16:\nCorollary 4.17 A map M : \u03a3n\u22121 \u2192 U(n) extends to L if and only there is a sequence\nof [n/2] obstructions\n2i\nc2i\nM \u2208 H (L, \u03a3; Z)\n\nfor i \u2208 {1, . . . , [n/2]}\n\nwhich all vanish (where c2i\nM is defined only when all the previous obstructions vanish\nb 1 and M\nb 2 are two\nand depends on the previous extensions made) .

There are two advantages of splitting\nthe problem into these separate extension problems. The first advantage is that it shows\nthat the higher obstructions cocycles c2i\nM (i > 1) for a map into U(n) can be studied\nindependently of the first obstruction cocycle c2M . The second advantage is that it will\nallow us in Corollary 4.25 to identify the first obstruction cocycle c2M in a very concrete\nmanner. The splitting of the U(n) extension problem is achieved as follows:\nGiven U \u2208 U(n) define a map \u03c0S1 : U(n) \u2192 S1 by \u03c0S1 (U) = detC U and a map\n\u03c0SU(n) : U(n) \u2192 SU(n) by \u03c0SU(n) (U) = diag(\u03c0S1 (U) , 1, . . . , 1)\u22121 U . Since any U in\nU(n) may be written uniquely as a product U = diag(\u03c0S1 (U), 1, . . . , 1) * \u03c0SU(n) (M),\nwe see that U(n) is diffeomorphic to S1 \u00d7 SU(n). In particular, any map M from any\ntopological space X into U(n) induces two composition maps MS1 := \u03c0S1 \u25e6 M and\nMSU(n) := \u03c0SU(n) \u25e6 M from X into S1 and SU(n) respectively. Conversely any pair\nof maps from X into S1 and SU(n) determines a unique map from X into U(n). In\nb : L \u2192 U(n) if and only if the maps\nparticular, a map M : \u03a3 \u2192 U(n) extends to M\n1\nMS1 : \u03a3 \u2192 S and MSU(n) : \u03a3 \u2192 SU(n) both extend to L.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1495\n\nRemark 4.18 Using the observation above it follows that for any CW-complex K the\nhomotopy classes of maps [K; U(n)] can be identified (as a set but not necessarily as a\ngroup) with [K; S1 ] \u00d7 [K; SU(n)] ' H 1 (K, Z) \u00d7 [K; SU(n)] (using Lemma 3.17 for the\nfinal identification).\nWe must now apply the Theorem 4.16 to maps with target SU(n) or S1 and compare\nthe results obtained to those of Corollary 4.17, where the target is U(n). In particular,\nwe want to see how the [n/2] obstructions which occur in the U(n) case split into two\nparts according to the decomposition of the map into its S1 and SU(n) parts.\nSince U(n) ' S1 \u00d7 SU(n) as manifolds (but not as Lie groups), \u03c0i (U(n)) = \u03c0i (SU(n))\nfor i \u2265 2. We also have \u03c01 (SU(n)) = 0. Therefore, given a map M : \u03a3 \u2192 SU(n),\n2i\nby Theorem 4.16 there is a sequence of [n/2] \u2212 1 obstructions c2i\nM \u2208 H (L, \u03a3; Z)\nb : L \u2192 SU(n). In particular, the first\nfor i \u2208 {2, . . . , [n/2]} to extending M to M\nobstruction to extending a map M into U(n) disappears if instead M maps into SU(n).\nIn particular, if n = 2 or n = 3 then there are no obstructions to extending M . In other\nwords, we have the following extension result for maps into SU(2) or SU(3).\nCorollary 4.19 Let L be a compact smooth n\u2013manifold with boundary \u03a3 and let\nb : L \u2192 SU(n).\nM : \u03a3 \u2192 SU(n) be any map. Then for n = 2, 3, M extends to a map M\nFurthermore, the homotopy classes of maps L \u2192 SU(n) rel \u03a3 which equal M on \u03a3 are\nin one-to-one correspondence with 0 and Z for n = 2 and n = 3 respectively.\nRemark 4.20 Corollary 4.19 is already sufficient for a proof of Corollary 5.6 (see the\nsecond method of proof given there) and Corollary 5.9, and (via Remark 5.7) for the\napplications of Section 6.\nThe difference between the extensibility of maps M : \u03a3 \u2192 U(n) and MSU : \u03a3 \u2192 SU(n)\nwill be captured by the extensibility of the map MS1 : \u03a3 \u2192 S1 . Since S1 has trivial\nhomotopy groups for i > 1, given a map M : \u03a3 \u2192 S1 then Theorem 4.16 gives us\nprecisely one obstruction cocycle c2M \u2208 H 2 (L, \u03a3; Z) to extending it to L.\nHence as expected in total we have the same number of obstruction cocycles (namely\n[n/2] of them) which measure the nonextensibility for a map into U(n) or for a pair of\nmaps into SU(n) and S1 ; one of these cocycles encodes the extensibility of the map\ninto S1 , while the remaining [n/2] \u2212 1 encode the extensibility of the map into SU(n).\nTo proceed further we need to understand better the obstruction cocycles. For the\nconstruction of these cocycles ci+1\nM in the general case we refer the reader to Bredon [7,\nVII.13]. However, in the case that the only possible nonzero obstruction is the so-called\nprimary one it is simple to describe this obstruction. This will allow us to understand\nvery concretely the obstruction to extending a map into S1 .\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1496\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nTheorem 4.21 [7, Corollary VII.13.13] Let (X, A) be a CW-pair and Y be simple\nand (k \u2212 1)\u2013connected.

Then M\nof the cohomology sequence of any pair (X, A).\nThe following elementary lemma about \u03b4 \u2217 is useful for applications of Theorem 4.21.\nLemma 4.23 Let L be a compact connected n\u2013manifold M with boundary \u2202L = \u03a3.\nThe map \u03b4 \u2217 : H n\u22121 (\u2202L; G) \u2192 H n (L, \u2202L; G) is surjective for any coefficient group G.\nIf additionally, L is orientable and \u2202L is connected, then \u03b4 \u2217 is an isomorphism.\nProof Any compact n\u2013manifold with nonempty boundary has the homotopy type of\na CW complex of dimension at most n \u2212 1 [35, page 170]. In particular, H n (L) = 0\nfor any coefficient group G. Surjectivity of \u03b4 \u2217 : H n\u22121 (\u2202L) \u2192 H n (L, \u2202L) now follows\nimmediately from the exactness of the cohomology sequence of the pair (L, \u2202L). If\nL is orientable, then we may use Poincar\u00e9\u2013Lefschetz duality [7, page 357] to identify\nker \u03b4 \u2217 with ker i\u2217 , where i\u2217 : H0 (\u2202L) \u2192 H0 (L) is the map induced by the inclusion\ni : \u2202L \u2192 L. If \u2202L is connected then i\u2217 is an isomorphism and hence so is \u03b4 \u2217 .\nRemark 4.24 If L is orientable but \u03a3 is disconnected with k \u2265 2 components, then\n\u03b4 \u2217 : H n\u22121 (\u03a3) \u2192 H n (L, \u03a3) fails to be an isomorphism (since H n (L, \u03a3; G) = G while\nH n\u22121 (\u03a3; G) ' H0 (\u03a3; G) = Gk ).\nIt remains to use Theorem 4.21 to study the obstructions to extending maps into S1 and\nSU(n). We begin with maps into S1 .\nCorollary 4.25 Let L be a compact connected smooth n\u2013manifold with boundary \u03a3\nand i : \u03a3 \u2192 L denote the natural inclusion map.

Moreover, in this case\nb which is homotopic to a constant map from L, and the possible\nthere is an extension M\nhomotopy classes of different extensions of M are parameterized by H 1 (L, \u03a3; Z).\nConversely, if either\n(i) L is an orientable surface with connected boundary \u03a3, or\n(ii) H 1 (L; Z) = 0,\nthen M extends to L if and only if M is homotopic to a constant.\nProof Since S1 is 0\u2013connected and its higher homotopy groups \u03c0i for i \u2265 2 all vanish\nthen M extends if and only if the map \u03b4 \u2217 M \u2217 : H 1 (S1 ; Z) \u2192 H 2 (L, \u03a3; Z) is zero by\nTheorem 4.21. Since H 1 (S1 ; Z) = Z and is generated by [d\u03b8], this is true if and only if\n\u03b4 \u2217 M \u2217 [d\u03b8] = 0. But by the exactness of the long exact sequence in cohomology of the\npair (L, \u03a3), M \u2217 [d\u03b8] \u2208 ker \u03b4 \u2217 if and only if M \u2217 [d\u03b8] \u2208 Im i\u2217 . Clearly, if H 1 (L, Z) = (0)\nthen M \u2217 [d\u03b8] \u2208 Im i\u2217 if and only if M \u2217 [d\u03b8] = 0, which by Lemma 3.17 is equivalent\nto M being homotopic to a constant. In case (i), it follows from Lemma 4.23 that\n\u03b4 \u2217 : H 1 (\u03a3; Z) \u2192 H 2 (L, \u03a3; Z) is an isomorphism. Hence \u03b4 \u2217 M \u2217 = 0 if and only if\nM \u2217 [d\u03b8] = 0, as in case (ii). If M is homotopic to a constant then since the pair (L, \u03a3)\nsatisfies the homotopy extension property for any space Y then there is an extension\nb : L \u2192 S1 which is homotopic to a constant map. The statement about the different\nM\nhomotopy classes of extensions follows from the second part of Theorem 4.16 since the\nonly nonzero obstruction space H i (L, \u03a3, \u03c0i (S1 )) occurs when i = 1.\nRemark 4.26 It is interesting to check what Corollary 4.25 says in the nonorientable\ncase. For example, suppose L is the M\u00f6bius strip with boundary \u03a3 = S1 . Then\nH 1 (L, Z) ' Z ' H 1 (\u03a3, Z) and i\u2217 is the map n 7\u2192 2n, so it has image 2Z \u2282 H 1 (\u03a3, Z).\nThus a map M : \u03a3 \u2192 S1 extends to L if and only if M \u2217 [d\u03b8] \u2208 2Z. From Example 4.14,\nthe image under i\u2217 of the possible Maslov classes of L \u2282 C2 is the set 4Z+2 \u2282 H 1 (\u03a3, Z).\nOn the other hand, the standard immersion of \u03a3 in C has Maslov class 2 \u2208 H 1 (\u03a3, Z)\n(when calculated via det2C ); this is also the Maslov class of any exact perturbation of this\nimmersion, and of the corresponding \"cylindrical thickening\" f in C2 (see Example 4.5).\nOne could use these facts as a basis for proving that the Prescribed Boundary Problem\ndetermined by this (\u03a3, L, f ) is solvable. The solution is actually known explicitly [3].\nSimilarly, if we apply Theorem 4.21 with Y = SU(n) then we obtain the following\nextension of Corollary 4.19.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1498\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nCorollary 4.27 Let L be a compact connected smooth n\u2013manifold with boundary \u03a3\nand i : \u03a3 \u2192 L denote the natural inclusion map.

If n = 4, L is\norientable and \u03a3 is connected, then by Lemma 4.23 \u03b4 \u2217 : H 3 (\u03a3; Z) \u2192 H 4 (L; \u03a3, Z) is\nan isomorphism. Hence \u03b4 \u2217 M \u2217 = 0 if and only if M \u2217 \u0398 = 0.

Using the retraction GL(n, C) \u2192 U(n), M is homotopic\nto a map which takes values in U(n); we will continue to denote this map M . Let MS1\nand MSU(n) denote the associated maps into S1 and SU(n) respectively.

The idea of the proof is now of course to apply the previous\nobstruction theory results to the maps MS1 and MSU(n) . Notice however that, as\nrequired in Lemma 4.11, we want to extend not only the values of these maps on \u03a3\nbut also on a neighbourhood of \u03a3. Furthermore we want the extension to be smooth.\nTo achieve this, let us choose a (closed, sufficiently small) tubular neighbourhood\nN ' \u03a3 \u00d7 [0, \u000f] \u2286 Op \u03a3; let \u03a3\u000f denote the \"inner boundary\" \u03a3 \u00d7 {\u000f} \u2282 N . We can\napply the obstruction theory results to MS1 and MSU(n) restricted to \u03a3\u000f , obtaining\n\u2217\nobstructions MS\u22171 [d\u03b8] and MSU(n)\n\u0398.\nNote To be precise, these cocycles live in H 1 (\u03a3\u000f , Z) and H 3 (\u03a3\u000f , Z) but we can identify\nthese with H 1 (\u03a3, Z) and H 3 (\u03a3, Z), respectively.\nConditions (i) and (ii) now follow from Corollary 4.25 and Corollary 4.27. When the\nconditions are satisfied we obtain continuous extensions defined on the complement\nL \\ N of the tubular neighbourhood; together with the given values of MS1 and MSU(n) on\nN , we now have continuous extensions defined on the whole of L. Standard perturbation\nresults show that we can assume that these extensions are smooth.\nIt remains only to show that MS\u22171 [d\u03b8] can be identified with the Maslov class of the\nLagrangian map f : Op \u03a3 \u2192 Cn . By considering a sufficiently small neighbourhood of\n\u03a3, we can assume that Op \u03a3 is contractible onto N . The homotopy invariance of \u03bcf\nthen allows us to restrict f to N . Recall from Lemma 4.13 that, since F0 is Maslov-zero,\n\u03bcf is the homotopy class of detC M : N \u2192 S1 . The claim then follows from the fact\nthat detC M = MS1 and the identifications [N, S1 ] ' [\u03a3, S1 ] ' H 1 (\u03a3, Z) (where the\nlast isomorphism is via pullback of [d\u03b8]; see Lemma 3.17).\n\n5\n\nThe Prescribed Boundary Problem in low dimensions\n\nCorollary 4.10 showed that solving the Prescribed Boundary Problem is equivalent to\nfinding a compatible trivialization, which by Lemma 4.11 is equivalent to solving a\ncertain extension problem. Theorem 4.28 shows that in low dimensions the obstructions\nto solving this extension problem can be written down explicitly. We will now examine\nthese cases one by one.\nNote To simplify the exposition, throughout this section we will assume that Op \u03a3\nis a tubular neighbourhood of \u03a3 \u2282 L so that O' \u03a3 ' \u03a3 \u00d7 [0, \u000f). As in the proof of\nTheorem 4.28, we will use this to identify \u03bcf \u2208 H 1 (Op \u03a3, Z) with the corresponding\nelement in H 1 (\u03a3, Z).\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1500\n\n5.1\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nThe Prescribed Boundary Problem in R4\n\nSuppose we are given an immersion i : \u03a3 \u2192 R4 where \u03a3 is a finite union of oriented\ncircles.

If \u03a3 is connected then \u03a3 = \u2202L for\nany orientable surface L with connected boundary; if \u03a3 is not connected, the claim now\nfollows via oriented connect sums. Furthermore, (unlike the case of closed surfaces)\nany orientable surface with nonempty boundary is parallelizable. (A proof of this fact\ncan be seen as follows: any n\u2013manifold with nonempty boundary has the homotopy\ntype of a CW complex of dimension at most n \u2212 1. Since any orientable surface with\nboundary can be embedded in R3 it is stably parallelizable. But any stably trivial bundle\nof rank k > d is actually trivial over any space homotopy equivalent to a CW complex\nof dimension at most d [35, Corollary IX.1.5]. Hence the tangent bundle of L is trivial.)\nThus assumptions A and B are both satisfied.\nFor dimensional reasons i is always isotropic. In general however it will not satisfy the\nexactness condition C, so we must make this additional assumption on i. Example 4.1\nshows that if \u03a3 is connected then exactness of \u03a3 is in fact a necessary condition for the\nexistence of a smooth Lagrangian extension f : L \u2192 R4 .\nBefore applying the obstruction theory results to this set-up, we begin by making the\nfollowing simple observation.\nLemma 5.1 Let \u03b3 be the boundary of an immersed oriented Lagrangian surface\nf : L \u2192 R4 and suppose that \u03b3 is connected. Then the Maslov index of \u03b3 , \u03bcf ([\u03b3]),\nmust be zero.\nProof This is immediate since \u03bcf ([\u03b3]) depends only on the homology class of the loop\n\u03b3.\nRemark 5.2 It follows from Lemma 5.1 that any connected separating curve in a\nclosed oriented Lagrangian surface has zero Maslov index.\nLemma 5.1 shows that when \u03a3 is connected a smooth oriented solution to the Prescribed\nBoundary Problem exists only if the initial data (\u03b3, L2 , f ) is Maslov-zero. One can give\nconcrete examples of exact initial data which are not Maslov zero as follows.\nExample 5.3 Given any pair of relatively prime positive integers p, q define a curve\n\u03b3 \u2282 S3 by\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1\n\u03b3p,q (\u03b8) := \u221a\nqeip\u03b8 , i pe\u2212iq\u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0].\np+q\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1501\n\nEach curve \u03b3p,q is a Legendrian curve in S3 , and hence is exact. Since \u03b3p,q is Legendrian\nthe cone over \u03b3p,q , denoted Cp,q is Lagrangian. It is not difficult to show that the\nMaslov index of the curve \u03b3p,q in the Lagrangian cone Cp,q is p \u2212 q [45, Remark 4.4].\n(The cones Cp,q were studied by Schoen\u2013Wolfson and are important because up to\nunitary transformations they account for all the Hamiltonian stationary cones in C2 .)\nNow take \u03b3 to be \u03b3p,q and take the Lagrangian thickening of \u03b3p,q to be a truncation of\nthe cone over \u03b3 , eg we could take f : \u03b3 \u00d7 [0, 1) \u2192 R4 to be f (\u03b8, t) = (1 + t)\u03b3p,q (\u03b8)).\nThen for any oriented filling L the exact initial data (\u03a3, L2 , f ) has nonzero Maslov class\nprovided p 6= q, and hence there is no smooth solution to the Lagrangian Prescribed\nBoundary Problem with such initial data.\nThe main result of this section, Theorem 5.4, provides a converse to Lemma 5.1. The\nreader may also like to compare Lemma 5.1 with the following result of Schoen\u2013Wolfson:\ngiven any exact smooth Jordan curve \u03b3 in R4 and m \u2208 Z, there exists a piecewise\nsmooth Lagrangian disk D bounding \u03b3 so that \u03b3 has Maslov index equal to m [45,\nProposition 4.1].\nWe now state the main result of this section.\nTheorem 5.4 Let L be a connected oriented surface with boundary \u03a3 and suppose\n(\u03a3, L, f ) is exact initial data in the sense of Definition 4.2.\n(1) If \u03a3 is connected then the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable if and only\nif f has zero Maslov class, ie \u03bcf = 0.\n(2) In general, the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable if and only if\n\u03bcf \u2208 Im(i\u2217 : H 1 (L, Z) \u2192 H 1 (\u03a3, Z)).\nFurthermore, if \u03bcf = 0 then one can always find a solution with zero Maslov\nclass.\nProof Part (2) is a direct consequence of Theorem 4.28; in dimension 2 the second\ncondition there is vacuous, ie the matrix-valued map MSU(2) corresponding to df C is\nalways extensible (see also Corollary 4.19). The existence of a Maslov-zero solution\nfollows from the fact that if \u03bcf is zero then the map MS1 is homotopic to a constant\nmap by Lemma 3.17. Corollary 4.25 then shows that this map admits a homotopically\nconstant extension.\nPart (1) now follows from case (i) of Corollary 4.25.\n\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1502\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nExample 5.5 Let L be any closed n\u2013manifold with TLC trivial. By Proposition 3.19,\ngiven any \u03bc \u2208 H 1 (L, Z), there exists an exact Lagrangian immersion f : L \u2192 Cn with\n\u03bcf = \u03bc. Hence if H 1 (L, Z) 6= 0, then we have Maslov nonzero exact Lagrangian\nimmersions of L.\nLet f : L \u2192 Cn be any exact Lagrangian immersion with nonzero Maslov class. The\nimmersion C(f ) : L \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2282 Cn \u00d7 C defined by C(f )(p, t) = (f (p), t) defines an\nexact Lagrangian \"generalized cylinder\" in Cn+1 and gives a solution to the Prescribed\nBoundary Problem determined by the data C(f ) : L \u00d7 [0, \u000f) \u222a L \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u000f, 1] \u2192 Cn+1 . It\nis clear that this initial data has \u03bcC(f ) 6= 0, and thus shows that part (1) of Theorem 5.4\nis false if we do not assume that \u03a3 is connected.\nAn immediate corollary of Theorem 5.4 is the following result:\nCorollary 5.6 Let (\u03a3, L2 , f ) be exact SL initial data. Then the Prescribed Boundary\nProblem admits a Maslov-zero solution.\nIn particular, let \u03a3 be an exact real-analytic curve of R4 (eg any real-analytic Legendrian\ncurve in S3 ). Choose any oriented surface L bounding \u03a3. Then for any \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0)\nthere exists an exact Lagrangian immersion f\u03b8 : L \u2192 R4 with zero Maslov class which\ncoincides in a neighbourhood of \u03a3 with the \u03b8 -SL extension of \u03a3.\nProof If f is SL it is Maslov-zero, so we can apply the last statement of Theorem 5.4.\nThe statement regarding real analytic curves is based on Example 4.4.\nFor applications in Section 6 it will be useful to give a second proof of the previous\nresult.\nSecond proof of Corollary 5.6 According to Lemma 4.13, in Theorem 4.28 we can\nchoose the reference trivialization to be SL. If we start off with SL initial data, the map\nMS1 in Theorem 4.28 will have constant value 1, so we can extend it to a map on L with\nconstant value 1. Corollary 4.19 shows that there is no obstruction to extending MSU(2) .\nb extending df ; in particular F\nb is Maslov-zero. We\nWe thus obtain a SL monomorphism F\nb\ncan homotope F using the h\u2013principle to prove the existence of an exact Maslov-zero\nLagrangian extension.\nRemark 5.7 More generally, the idea in the second proof of Corollary 5.6 can also be\nused to prove part of Theorem 5.4 without relying on the full set of results presented in\nSection 4.4. Assume the initial data f is (exact and) Maslov-zero. Choose a reference\nSL trivialization \u03c60 of TLC . Again using Lemma 4.13, it is possible to homotope\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1503\n\ndf C to a SL monomorphism of Op \u03a3 which, via matrices and Corollary 4.19, admits\nan extension to L. By the homotopy property of extensions, this means that df C is\nextensible to a Lagrangian monomorphism of L. Applying the h\u2013principle to this\nmonomorphism allows us to conclude that the Prescribed Boundary Problem admits a\nMaslov-zero solution for such initial data. Clearly, this works also for n = 3.\n\n5.2\n\nThe Prescribed Boundary Problem in R6\n\nLet \u03a3 be any compact oriented surface not necessarily connected. If \u03a3 is connected\nwith genus g then it admits one obvious \"topological filling\" L3 , namely, the standard\ngenus g handlebody. One can then construct more complicated fillings of \u03a3 using\nthe standard topological surgeries. Using oriented connect sums one can show that \u03a3\nadmits (connected) fillings even if it is disconnected. Recall also that any compact\norientable 3\u2013manifold L is parallelizable. Finally, Example 5.10 below shows that any\ncompact oriented surface \u03a3 admits exact immersions i into R6 . Hence Assumptions\nA\u2013C can be satisfied for any compact orientable surface \u03a3.\nWe now apply our obstruction theory results to this case; once again, the second\nobstruction identified in Theorem 4.28 vanishes for dimensional reasons so the results\n(and proofs) are largely analogous to those obtained in dimension 2.\nTheorem 5.8 Let L be a connected oriented 3\u2013manifold with boundary \u03a3 and let\n(\u03a3, L, f ) be exact initial data in the sense of Definition 4.2. Then the Prescribed\nBoundary Problem is solvable if and only if \u03bcf \u2208 Im(i\u2217 : H 1 (L, Z) \u2192 H 1 (\u03a3, Z)).\nFurthermore, if \u03bcf = 0 then one can always find a solution with zero Maslov class.\nAs in the previous subsection, this result has an immediate corollary:\nCorollary 5.9 Let (\u03a3, L3 , f ) be exact SL initial data. Then the Prescribed Boundary\nProblem admits a Maslov-zero solution ef : L \u2192 R6 .\nIn particular, let \u03a3 be a real-analytic exact surface in R6 (eg any real-analytic Legendrian\nsubmanifold of S5 ). Choose any oriented 3\u2013manifold L bounding \u03a3. Then for any\n\u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) there exists an exact Lagrangian immersion f\u03b8 : L \u2192 R6 with zero Maslov\nclass which coincides in a neighbourhood of \u03a3 with the \u03b8 -SL extension of \u03a3.\nExample 5.10 Since the standard contact structure on S5 with one point removed is\ncontactomorphic to the standard contact structure on R5 [15], a closed surface \u03a3 admits\nLegendrian immersions into S5 if and only if it admits a Legendrian immersion into R5\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1504\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nwith its standard contact structure. Hence by previous remarks \u03a3 admits Legendrian\nimmersions into S5 if and only if it admits exact Lagrangian immersions into R4 . But\nwe saw in Section 3.5.1 that any compact orientable surface \u03a3 admits such immersions.\nThus, it is possible to find an exact immersion of \u03a3 in R6 for any orientable surface \u03a3.\nAnother special case for Theorem 5.8 occurs when H 1 (L, Z) = 0: in this case the\ncondition on \u03bcf simplifies to \u03bcf = 0. However, for n \u2265 3 there are constraints on the\ntopological complexity of any L which bounds \u03a3.\nLemma 5.11 Let L be a smooth oriented (2i+1)\u2013dimensional manifold with connected\nboundary \u03a3. Then dim H i (L, R) \u2265 12 bi (\u03a3).\nThe proof of Lemma 5.11 follows from Poincar\u00e9\u2013Lefschetz duality for compact\norientable manifolds with boundary; see eg Bredon [7, page 360]. In particular, when L\nis 3\u2013dimensional the special case H 1 (L, Z) = 0 can occur only if \u03a3 = S2 .\n\n5.3\n\nThe prescribed boundary problem in R8 and R10\n\nWe saw in Section 4, that when n equals 4 or 5, not every compact oriented n\u2013manifold\n\u03a3 admits an oriented filling L. Furthermore, even if \u03a3 bounds it is not clear that the\nbounding manifold L will have TLC trivial or that exact immersions of \u03a3 in R2n exist.\nRather than try to analyze further conditions on \u03a3 under which Assumptions A\u2013C can\nbe verified we shall simply assume we are given exact initial data (\u03a3, L, f ). Then we\ncan apply Theorem 4.28 to obtain the following results.\nTheorem 5.12 Let L be a connected oriented n\u2013manifold with boundary \u03a3 and let\n(\u03a3, L, f ) be exact initial data in the sense of Definition 4.2.\n(1) If n = 4 and \u03a3 is connected then the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable\nif and only if the following two conditions hold:\n\u03bcf \u2208 Im(i\u2217 : H 1 (L, Z) \u2192 H 1 (\u03a3, Z));\n\u2217\nMSU\n\u0398 = 0.\n\n(2) In general, if n = 4 or n = 5 then the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable\nif and only if the following two conditions hold:\n\u03bcf \u2208 Im(i\u2217 : H 1 (L, Z) \u2192 H 1 (\u03a3, Z));\n\u2217\nMSU\n\u0398 \u2208 Im(i\u2217 : H 3 (L, Z) \u2192 H 3 (\u03a3, Z)).\n\nIf the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable and moreover \u03bcf = 0, then one\ncan always find a solution with zero Maslov class.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1505\n\nProof The proof is similar to that of Theorem 5.4; when \u03a3 is connected and n = 4\nwe can prove the stronger condition using Corollary 4.27.\nOnce again, it is clearly useful to know if \u03a3 admits simply connected fillings. Using\nSurgery Theory one can prove the following simplification result for the fundamental\ngroup.\nTheorem 5.13 [40] Let X be any oriented compact manifold (with or without\nboundary) of dimension n with n \u2265 4. Then there exists a simply connected oriented\nmanifold X 0 (obtained by a finite sequence of surgeries of type (1, n\u22122)) with \u2202X = \u2202X 0 .\nIn particular, if L is an oriented n\u2013manifold which bounds \u03a3 and n \u2265 4 then there is a\nsimply connected manifold L0 which bounds \u03a3.\nThe basic point of the proof of Theorem 5.13 is that any nontrivial loop in \u03c01 (X) can be\nrepresented by an embedded S1 which has a trivial normal bundle. Then by performing\nsurgery on these embedded loops one can systematically kill the fundamental group of\nX . In order to try to simplify the higher-dimensional homotopy or homology groups\none needs to find higher-dimensional embedded spheres with trivial normal bundles\nrepresenting elements of these groups. Hence with further assumptions about the\nbounding manifold L one can use Surgery Theory to simplify its higher homotopy\ngroups; see Kosinski [35] for results in this direction.\n\n6\n\nLagrangian desingularizations\n\nWe now apply the results of Section 5 to answer the three questions posed in the\nIntroduction to this paper.\n\n6.1\n\nLagrangian submanifolds with exact isolated singularities in Cn\n\nDefinition 6.1 Let X be a connected topological space with a finite number of points\n{x1 , . . . , xm } such that the (not necessarily connected) space\nX 0 := X \\ {x1 , . . . , xm }\nis an oriented smooth n\u2013manifold. We say that X is an oriented manifold with isolated\nsingularities if, in addition, each xi has a connected open neighbourhood Ui such that\nUi \\ {xi } ' (0, 1) \u00d7 \u03a3i , for some compact (not necessarily connected) (n \u2212 1)-manifold\n\u03a3i , and so that Ui \u2229 Uj = \u2205, if i 6= j.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1506\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nLet X be an oriented n\u2013manifold with isolated singularities. We say that f : X \u2192 R2n\nis an oriented Lagrangian submanifold with isolated singularities if f is continuous and\nf |X 0 is a Lagrangian immersion.\nWe say that X has exact singularities if each restriction f |Ui is exact. This \"local\nexactness\" condition is satisfied automatically near any smooth point of X . We say that\nX is exact or that it has zero Maslov class if this is true for X 0 .\nExample 6.2 Let X be any oriented Lagrangian cone in R2n with an isolated singularity\nat the origin, and let \u03a3 denote the intersection of X with S2n\u22121 . \u03a3 is an oriented\nLegendrian submanifold of S2n\u22121 which is not a totally geodesic sphere. The origin is\nthen an isolated singular point of X which has a neighbourhood in X whose boundary\nis diffeomorphic to \u03a3; X 0 has the same number of connected components as \u03a3.\nWe now give two ways to see that any Lagrangian cone X is exact. Since \u03a3 is Legendrian\nand the standard contact form \u03b1 on S2n\u22121 is just the restriction of \u03bb to S2n\u22121 it follows\nimmediately that \u03a3 and hence X is exact. Alternatively, given any closed curve \u03b3 \u2282 X\nand r \u2208 R+ , we can \"slide\" \u03b3 to the curve r * \u03b3 . As r \u2192 0 the length of r * \u03b3 goes to\n0. Hence, by Stokes' Theorem,\nZ\nZ\n\u03bb=\n\u03bb \u2192 0 as r \u2192 0.\n\u03b3\n\nSince\n\nR\n\u03b3\n\nr*\u03b3\n\n\u03bb is however independent of r, it must be zero.\n\nExample 6.3 Let X be a smooth oriented n\u2013manifold and f : X \u2192 R2n be a continuous\nmap which is a Lagrangian immersion except at a finite number of points {x1 , . . . , xm }.\nThen f defines a Lagrangian submanifold with isolated singularities. In this example\nthe singularities arise from f rather than from X , so each \u03a3i is diffeomorphic to Sn\u22121 .\nIt is important to find conditions on f ensuring that its singularities are exact. This can\nbe done fairly easily, as shown by the following example.\nExample 6.4 Suppose f : X \u2192 Cn is a Lagrangian submanifold with isolated singularities {x1 , . . . , xm }. Let g denote the pullback metric on Ui \\ {xi } ' (0, 1) \u00d7 \u03a3i . Let\nr denote the variable on (0, 1) and p any point on \u03a3i .\nSuppose that g is a \"O(r\u03b2 )\u2013approximation\" of a metric g0 = dr2 + r2\u03b1 gi , for some\n\u03b1, \u03b2 > 0 and some smooth metric gi on the cross-section \u03a3i . More precisely, we ask\nthat g = g0 + h, for some symmetric tensor h = h(r, p) whose norm (calculated with\nrespect to g0 ) is bounded by some r\u03b2 . Then the singularities of f are locally exact. The\nproof is similar to that given for Lagrangian cones in Example 6.2, but we now use\nclosed curves \u03b3 \u2282 \u03a3i . The condition on the metric ensures that the length of the curves\nr * \u03b3 tends to zero as r \u2192 0.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1507\n\nIn particular, if X is a SL n\u2013fold with isolated conical singularities in the sense of Joyce\n[31, Definition 3.6] then X is an oriented Lagrangian submanifold with exact isolated\nsingularities in the sense of Definition 6.1.\nDefinition 6.5 Let f : X \u2192 R2n be a Lagrangian submanifold with isolated singularities x1 , . . . , xm , and mutually disjoint connected neighbourhoods U1 , . . . , Um of\nthese singular points as in Definition 6.1. Let Y be a smooth oriented n\u2013manifold\n(not necessarily connected) and let V1 , . . . , Vm be mutually disjoint (not necessarily\nS\nSm\nconnected) open subsets of Y so that Y \\ m\ni=1 Vi is diffeomorphic to X \\ j=1 Uj . We\ncall a Lagrangian immersion bf : Y \u2192 R2n an oriented Lagrangian desingularization of\nS\nSm\nX if bf = f on the sets Y \\ m\ni=1 Vi = X \\ j=1 Uj .\nRemark 6.6 As a very simple example we can consider the connected 2\u2013dimensional\nsingular space X with one singular point x1 , formed by taking a 2\u2013sphere and identifying\ntwo distinct points. Then there is a neighbourhood U1 of x1 that has two boundary\ncomponents each diffeomorphic to S1 . If we take V1 to be the disjoint union of two\ndiscs bounded by these two circles, then the resulting manifold Y will be diffeomorphic\nto S2 . If instead we take V1 to be a cylinder bounding these two circles, the resulting\nmanifold will be a 2\u2013torus.\nMore generally, even though we start with a connected space X , when we remove the\nsingular points the resulting nonsingular manifold X 0 will in general be disconnected.\nThe manifold Y may take different components of X 0 and reconnect them into fewer\ncomponents, but not necessarily into one component only. In particular, different\ncomponents of the deleted neighbourhood of one singular point Ui \\ {xi } can end up in\ndifferent connected components of Y .\nGiven a Lagrangian submanifold X with isolated singularities, it is natural to ask\nif it admits any Lagrangian desingularization Y . Furthermore, if desingularizations\ndo exist then we would like to know what topology Y can have, and whether the\ndesingularization process preserves extra properties such as exactness or zero Maslov\nclass. In the oriented case we can now prove the following results.\nTheorem 6.7 For n = 2 or n = 3, let f : X \u2192 Cn be an oriented Maslov-zero\nLagrangian submanifold with exact isolated singularities {x1 , . . . , xm } in the sense of\nDefinition 6.1. Then X admits oriented Lagrangian desingularizations in the sense of\nDefinition 6.5 with arbitrarily complicated topology.\nFurthermore, let Ui be a connected neighbourhood of xi with smooth (not necessarily\nconnected) oriented boundary \u03a3i . If either\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1508\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\n(i) each \u03a3i is connected, or\n(ii) X is SL,\nthen X also admits Maslov-zero oriented desingularizations with arbitrarily complicated topology. Finally, if each \u03a3i is connected and X is also exact, then all these\ndesingularizations are exact.\nProof Recall from Definition 6.1 that Ui \\ {xi } ' (0, 1) \u00d7 \u03a3i . Choose any oriented\nfilling Li of \u03a3i . By assumption X is locally exact, so we can apply the results of\nSection 5 to f restricted to Op \u03a3i ' \u03a3i \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u000f, 1]; this proves that the Prescribed\nBoundary Problem defined by the initial data (\u03a3i , Li , f ) admits an exact Maslov-zero\nsolution bfi . Iterating this construction near each singular point produces an oriented\nLagrangian desingularization bf : Y \u2192 Cn of X in the sense of Definition 6.1. Y is\nsmooth because we chose, as initial data, an open neighbourhood of \u03a3i rather than\n\u03a3i itself. The topology of Y is \"arbitrarily complicated\" in the sense already seen in\nSection 5: we are allowed to perform any number of topological surgeries on each Li\nso as to increase its topological complexity.\nSuppose now that each \u03a3i is connected. Let \u03b3 be a closed curve in Y . Since each \u03a3i is\nconnected, we can homologically split \u03b3 into the sum of r closed curves \u03b3k such that\nS\neach \u03b3k is completely contained either in X \\ m\nj=1 Uj or in some Lk . Then, since on\neach of these sets bf is Maslov-zero,\n\u03bcbf ([\u03b3]) =\n\nr\nX\n\n\u03bcbf ([\u03b3k ]) = 0.\n\nk=1\n\nHence Y is Maslov-zero. The same method proves the corresponding statement for\nexact desingularizations.\nSuppose instead that X is SL. The second proof of Corollary 5.6 (which works also\nfor n = 3) shows that we can extend the initial data df on each Op \u03a3i to a SL\nmonomorphism Fbi defined on Li . The corresponding Lagrangian immersion of Li ,\nobtained via the h\u2013principle, is clearly Maslov-zero but has the additional virtue of\nbeing SL on Op \u03a3i . Let us now choose any closed curve \u03b3 in Y . Let G(\u03b3) denote the\ncorresponding curve of tangent planes, defined as G(\u03b3)(t) := T\u03b3(t) Y . This is a closed\ncurve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian bundle Grlag (R2n ). According to Lemma 3.17,\nto show that Y has zero Maslov class it is equivalent to show that for any such \u03b3 the\ncorresponding curve detC \u25e6G(\u03b3) is homotopically trivial in S1 .\nS\nIf \u03b3 is completely contained in X \\ m\nj=1 Uj , then G(\u03b3) is by hypothesis a curve of SL\nplanes so detC \u25e6G(\u03b3) \u2261 1; in particular, it is homotopically trivial. The same is true\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1509\n\nif \u03b3 is completely contained in some Li . Finally, assume \u03b3 enters some Li at a point\npi \u2208 \u03a3i ; it is then forced to exit at a point qi \u2208 \u03a3i . Consider the portion of \u03b3 contained\nin Li . The h\u2013principle gives us a homotopy between the distribution of SL planes\nbi and the tangent planes of Li . Restricting this\ndetermined by the SL monomorphism F\nhomotopy to the corresponding portion of G(\u03b3), shows that our curve can be homotoped\nrel {pi , qi } to a curve of SL planes. We can repeat this procedure for each Li ; the\nremaining portion of G(\u03b3) is already special Lagrangian. This proves that also in this\ncase detC \u25e6G(\u03b3) is homotopically trivial.\nRemark 6.8 Our desingularization method starts with a Maslov-zero X and replaces a\nneighbourhood of each singular point with a Maslov-zero Li . We should not expect any\nsuch desingularization to be Maslov-zero. After all, this procedure is purely local and\nany Lagrangian submanifold is locally Maslov-zero, though not necessarily globally so.\nThe same is true for the exactness condition.\nCorollary 6.9 Let X be a SL cone in C3 . Then X admits connected oriented exact\nMaslov-zero desingularizations of arbitrarily complicated topology.\n\nProof Recall from Example 6.2 or Example 6.4 that X is exact. Let \u03a3 denote the (not\nnecessarily connected) link of X , ie the intersection of X with the sphere S5 \u2282 C3 .\nChoose any connected filling L of \u03a3; then the methods of Theorem 6.7 prove the\nexistence of a Maslov-zero Lagrangian desingularization Y . Since any curve in Y is\nhomotopic to a curve in L and L is exact by construction, then Y is exact even if \u03a3 is\nnot connected.\nExample 6.10 The result of Corollary 6.9 also holds for n = 2, but in this case it\nis well-known that SL desingularizations can be found explicitly as follows. Any\n2\u2013dimensional minimal cone (and in particular any SL cone) is the union of 2\u2013planes.\nThe \"hyperk\u00e4hler rotation\" trick shows that a submanifold of R4 is SL if and only if it is a\ncomplex submanifold with respect to one particular (nonstandard) complex structure on\nR4 . Accordingly, the i\u2013th plane \u03c0i can be described by some complex linear equation\nQ\nai1 z1 + ai2 z2 = 0, so our cone will be given by the equation ni=1 (ai1 z1 + ai2 z2 ) = 0.\nQn\nFor any nonzero \u000f \u2208 C the set i=1 (ai1 z1 + ai2 z2 ) = \u000f describes a smooth complex\nsurface in R4 . Notice that these surfaces do not coincide with the original cone outside\na compact set, but do become asymptotic to the cone at infinity. In this sense, these\nsurfaces are SL desingularizations of the original SL cone.\n\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1510\n\n6.2\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nDesingularization of Lagrangian singularities in almost Calabi\u2013Yau\nmanifolds\n\nThe goal of this section is to extend the results of Section 6.1 to more general ambient\nmanifolds. Let (M 2n , \u03c9) be a smooth symplectic manifold. By Darboux's Theorem M\nis locally symplectomorphic to R2n ; notice that Definition 6.1 relies on purely local\nproperties of f and X , so it is simple to extend this definition so that it includes the\nnotion of Lagrangian submanifolds f : X \u2192 M with isolated singularities. Unless M is\nexact, ie \u03c9 = d\u03bb for some 1\u2013form \u03bb, it is not possible to define a global exactness\ncondition for X (unless X happens to be contained inside one Darboux chart). However,\nit still makes sense to discuss whether X is locally exact near each of its singular points.\nThe generalization of the Maslov class to Lagrangian submanifolds of general symplectic\nmanifolds is more complicated but is well-known. For completeness we describe this\ngeneralization briefly and indicate the simplifications which occur when the symplectic\nmanifold is an almost Calabi\u2013Yau manifold.\nLet Ln be an oriented Lagrangian submanifold of (M, \u03c9). As in Section 3 denote by\nGr+\nlag (M) the oriented Lagrangian Grassmannian bundle of M . The main issue is that in\ngeneral Gr+\nlag (M) is now a nontrivial U(n)/SO(n) fibre bundle over M .\nLet us fix a compatible almost complex structure J on M and let g be the metric\ndefined by \u03c9 and J . Let \u03b3\nb : (D2 , \u2202D) \u2192 (M, L) be a disk in M with boundary\n\u03b3 := \u03b3\nb(\u2202D) \u2282 L. Since D is contractible there exists a complex volume form \u03a9\ndefined on a neighbourhood of D in M . Any choice of \u03a9 defines an evaluation map\n\u2217\n\u03a9 : Gr+\nlag (M)|D \u2192 C ,\n\ndefined as follows. Let {ei }ni=1 be a g\u2013orthonormal basis for Tp L. Since Tp L is\nLagrangian {ei }ni=1 is a basis for the complex vector space (Tp M, J). In particular,\n{ei }ni=1 is linearly independent over C and hence defines an element e1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 en =\n6 0\nn,0\n\u2217\nin \u039b (Tp M, J). Hence we obtain a map from Tp L to C by evaluating \u03a9 on this\nnonzero n\u2013vector. It is easy to check that this map does not depend on the choice of the\northonormal basis of Tp L.\nThe Gauss map associates to \u03b3 a loop G(\u03b3) of Lagrangian tangent spaces defined by\nG(\u03b3)(t) := T|\u03b3(t) L; we can thus define the Maslov index \u03bcL (b\n\u03b3 ) of \u03b3\nb to be the degree of\nthe map\n\u03a9\n1\n: G(\u03b3) \u2282 Gr+\nlag (M) \u2192 S .\n|\u03a9|\nThis number is independent of the choice of J and \u03a9: this follows from the contractibility\nof D and of the space of compatible almost complex structures. For the same reason it\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1511\n\ndepends only on the relative homotopy class of \u03b3\nb ; we have thus defined a map on the\nrelative homotopy group\n\u03bcL : \u03c02 (M, L) \u2192 Z.\nLet us now assume that (M, \u03c9, g, J) is a K\u00e4hler manifold with trivial canonical\nbundle KM and fix a global never-vanishing holomorphic section \u03a9 of KM . In the\nspecial Lagrangian literature the data (M, \u03c9, g, J, \u03a9) often goes under the name almost\nCalabi\u2013Yau manifold; the manifold is Calabi\u2013Yau if \u03a9 is covariantly constant and\nsatisfies a normalization condition. Almost Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds provide a particularly\nconvenient framework for discussing Maslov indices, because the disk D is no longer\nneeded to guarantee the existence of the complex volume form in a neighbourhood of a\nloop \u03b3 \u2282 L. Hence the Maslov index can be thought of as a map\n\u03bcL : \u03c01 (L) \u2192 Z.\nAlternatively, we could proceed as in Section 3.4 using \u03a9/|\u03a9| instead of detC to define\na Maslov class \u03bcL \u2208 H 1 (L; Z). Once again, homotopy considerations show that the\nMaslov class is locally independent of the particular \u03a9, J used in this construction.\nIn particular, suppose we are given a Lagrangian submanifold of M with isolated\nsingularities. Then, in a Darboux neighbourhood of a singularity, it is Maslov-zero\naccording to the definition just given if and only if it is Maslov-zero with respect to\ndetC , ie according to the definition of Section 3.4.\nWe say that a Lagrangian submanifold L of an almost Calabi\u2013Yau manifold is special\nLagrangian if\nIm \u03a9|L = 0 and Re \u03a9|L > 0.\nEquivalently, notice that the data (\u03c9, g, J, \u03a9) defines a SU(n) principal fibre bundle over\nM , given by the set of all (g, J)\u2013unitary frames {e1 , . . . , en } such that \u03a9(e1 , . . . , en ) \u2208\nR+ ; L is special Lagrangian if, for each p \u2208 L, we can find an orthonormal basis\n{e1 , . . . , en } of Tp L which, as a unitary frame of Tp M , belongs to this fibre bundle.\nAny SL submanifold is automatically oriented by the volume form Re(\u03a9)|L , and clearly\nhas zero Maslov class.\nThe above considerations show that in Darboux coordinates any SL submanifold X\nwith isolated singularities is locally Maslov-zero in the sense of Section 3.4. As seen in\nExample 6.4, it is easy to use either the ambient metric g or the local metric induced by\nDarboux coordinates to find conditions ensuring that X is locally exact. Finally, the\nC0 \u2013dense version of the h\u2013principle [13, Section 6.2.D] proves that the methods used\nin the previous Sections are completely local; in other words the desingularizations\nthat we build there, near any singular point xi \u2208 X , can be made to live in any small\nneighbourhood of xi . In particular, the construction can take place completely inside\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1512\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nany Darboux coordinate chart. Our methods thus apply verbatim, proving the following\nresult.\nCorollary 6.11 Let M be an almost Calabi\u2013Yau manifold of dimension 2 or 3. Let\nX \u2282 M be a SL submanifold with isolated exact singularities. Then X admits oriented\nLagrangian desingularizations with zero Maslov class and arbitrarily complicated\ntopology.\n\n6.3\n\nSoft asymptotically conical smoothings of SL cones\n\nFinally, in this section we address the third question posed in the Introduction to this\npaper. We begin with the following definition, adapted from Joyce [31, Definition 7.1].\nDefinition 6.12 Let Cn be a regular oriented cone in Cn with oriented (not necessarily\nconnected) link \u03a3n\u22121 . Let i : \u03a3 \u00d7 (0, \u221e) \u2192 Cn denote the corresponding immersion.\nWe say that an immersion f : \u03a3 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u000f, \u221e) \u2192 Cn is an asymptotically conical (AC)\nend with decay \u03bb and cone C if\n|\u2207k (f \u2212 i)| = O(r\u03bb\u22121\u2212k ) as r \u2192 \u221e for k = 0, 1.\nHere, \u2207 and | * | are defined using the natural metric g0 on C and we assume \u03bb < 2.\nNow suppose both i and f are Lagrangian. Even though i is automatically exact, in\ngeneral there is no reason for f to be exact. However, it is simple to find additional\nassumptions ensuring that f is also exact. One such assumption was described by Joyce\n[31, Proposition 7.3]: if \u03bb < 0 then f is exact. Notice also that, under this assumption,\nif C is Maslov-zero then this will be true also for f because the two manifolds are\nC1 \u2013asymptotically close at infinity. Another possible assumption is as follows. Suppose\n\u03c8 is a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of Cn and that f := \u03c8 \u25e6 i (where we restrict i to\n\u03a3 \u00d7 [1 \u2212 \u000f, \u221e) and assume that \u03c8 decays appropriately at infinity (so as to ensure the\nAC condition on f ). Then f is exact and it is Maslov-zero if and only if C is.\nSuppose now that C is SL and that \u03a3 satisfies Assumptions A\u2013C; as we have already\nremarked, these assumptions can be satisfied in low dimensions via any compact oriented\nchoice of filling L. We can then try to solve the Prescribed Boundary Problem for\nthe exact initial data (\u03a3, L, f ) where now f is restricted to \u03a3 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 \u000f, 1]. Since C is\nMaslov-zero, under either of the above assumptions f will be Maslov-zero also. We can\nthus conclude that in dimensions 2 and 3 the Prescribed Boundary Problem is solvable.\nThe resulting submanifold Y still has the AC ends given by f , and Y is thus an exact\nMaslov-zero Lagrangian submanifold asymptotic to the SL cone C.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\nA\n\n1513\n\nComparisons with other results in the literature\n\nThe goal of this Appendix is to fit our results into a broader context by describing some\nsimilarities, differences and relationships with other constructions in the Lagrangian\nand SL literature.\n\nA.1\n\nLagrangian cobordism groups\n\nArnold [1] defined various types of Lagrangian and Legendrian cobordism groups. In\n[3, 4], Audin provides a detailed study of the oriented and nonoriented exact Lagrangian\ncobordism groups.\nThe abstract set-up is by now standard for cobordism-type theories: given a specific\ncategory of geometric objects, one defines an equivalence relationship such that, under\ndisjoint union, the equivalence classes inherit a group structure. Following Thom, one\nthen looks for an algebraic formulation of these groups in terms of homotopy groups of\ncertain universal classifying spaces. The calculation of these homotopy groups is often\npossible but relies on rather sophisticated methods in homotopy theory.\nIn Audin's case, the geometric objects in question are pairs (L, f ) where L is a closed\n(not necessarily connected) smooth manifold with TLC trivial and f : L \u2192 Cn is\nan exact Lagrangian immersion. Two such pairs (L0 , f0 ) and (L1 , f1 ) are considered\nequivalent if\n(1) L0 , L1 are cobordant in the usual sense; ie there exists a manifold Y such that\n\u2202Y = L0 \u222a L1 (in the oriented category, we also require that the orientations be\ncompatible in the sense that \u2202Y = \u2212L0 \u222a L1 ;\n(2) Y has TY C trivial and admits an exact Lagrangian immersion F : Y \u2192 Cn+1\nwhich, on the boundary, restricts to the isotropic immersions (f0 , 0, 0) and\n(f1 , 1, 0);\n(3) let n denote the inward unit conormal of Li \u2282 Y . Then, using the standard\nnotation for complex variables zj = xj + iyj , we require that dF(n) = \u2202xn+1\nalong L0 and dF(n) = \u2212\u2202xn+1 along L1 .\nThe third condition should be thought of as a transversality condition which implies\na canonical form for F near the boundary similar to our \"cylindrical thickenings\" in\nExample 4.5. A more thorough discussion of these groups can be found in [4, page 21].\n[4] provides an algebraic reformulation of these Lagrangian cobordism groups (both\noriented and nonoriented) in terms of a Thom-type set-up. Using this reformulation\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1514\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nAudin computes the oriented cobordism groups in dimensions up to 10, often identifying\nexplicit generators. Along the way, Audin defines and studies the Maslov-zero analogues\nof these groups (\"SL cobordism groups\") as a tool to compute the full oriented cobordism\ngroups [4, page XII]. In the unoriented case matters simplify considerably: if L0 and L1\nare cobordant as smooth unoriented manifolds and both admit Lagrangian immersions\nf0 , f1 in Cn , then (L0 , f0 ) and (L1 , f1 ) are exact Lagrangian cobordant [3, Corollary 2.2]\nAudin's results apply to the Lagrangian Cobordism Problem stated in Section 4.1 as\nfollows. Using the notation of that section, suppose that the exact isotropic immersion\ni : \u03a3 \u2192 R2n is in fact an exact Lagrangian immersion into R2n\u22122 . If the pair (\u03a3, i) is\nzero in the exact Lagrangian cobordism group then our Lagrangian Cobordism Problem\nwith boundary data (\u03a3, i) is solvable. A priori, this does not allow us to prescribe\nthe topology of the filling L nor the data of the Lagrangian thickening. A deeper\nunderstanding of the relationship between the Lagrangian cobordism groups and our\nPrescribed Boundary Problem requires many of the tools described in Section 3 and\nSection 4.\nWe expect that the more direct methods used in this paper and the explicit results of\nSection 5 and Section 6 are closer to the needs of differential geometers interested in\nSL singularities.\n\nA.2\n\nLagrangian surgeries\n\nThe fillings and desingularizations obtained in Section 5 and Section 6 are in general only\nimmersed, not embedded. Moreover, as already mentioned in Remark 3.8, Lagrangian\nembeddings of a fixed manifold L do not satisfy any type of h\u2013principle. However,\na generic Lagrangian immersion of L will contain only isolated transverse double\npoints and there exists a standard Lagrangian surgery procedure which replaces a\nneighborhood of any such self-intersection with an embedded Lagrangian 1\u2013handle\n[44]. If the number of double points is finite, an iteration of this procedure will thus\ne Clearly, this procedure changes the\ngenerate an embedded Lagrangian submanifold L.\ne have different cohomology groups in dimensions 1 and n \u2212 1.\ntopology of L: L and L\nIt will thus affect the Maslov class of L and usually also its orientability. However,\ne is orientable\nwhen n is odd-dimensional one can always choose this surgery so that L\nprovided L is. Thus, for example, in the n = 3 case the only problem introduced by\nthese surgeries concerns the Maslov class. However it is not clear how to deal with\nthis issue. In particular, it is not clear if it is possible to apply the Lagrangian surgery\nprocedure to the immersed Maslov-zero desingularizations obtained in Section 6 and\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1515\n\nSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\nget embedded Maslov-zero desingularizations. It seems very likely that there would be\nfurther topological obstructions to being able to do this.\nPolterovich's surgery procedure relies on the existence of an explicit Lagrangian model\nfor desingularizing the union of any two Lagrangian planes. It is precisely the lack\nof analogous models for other types of singularities, such as most Lagrangian cones,\nthat motivates our use of nonexplicit h\u2013principle techniques to prove the existence of\n(immersed) desingularizations.\n\nA.3\n\nFu's SL moment conditions\n\nIt is well-known that in a Calabi\u2013Yau manifold (M, \u03a9, g, J, \u03c9), an orientable submanifold\nL is SL (with the correct choice of orientation) if and only if \u03c9 and \u03b2 := Im \u03a9 restrict\nto zero on L. Thus if a compact Lagrangian submanifold Ln (with or without\nR boundary)\nis SL, or is even only homologous to a SL, it must satisfy the condition L \u03b2 = 0.\nOne can immediately derive other constraints that any SL submanifold of a Calabi\u2013Yau\nmanifold must satisfy by considering the differential ideal I generated by \u03c9 and \u03b2 . Let\n\u03a9(M) denote the algebra of real differential forms on M . Recall that a differential ideal\non a smooth manifold M is an ideal I of \u03a9(M) which is also d \u2013closed; in other words,\nI is a differential ideal if \u03b1 \u2208 I and \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a9(M) implies that \u03b1 \u2227 \u03b2 \u2208 I and d\u03b1 \u2208 I .\nUsing the standard properties of forms under pullback and exterior differentiation we\nsee that if f is a SL-immersion, then f \u2217 \u03c3 = 0 for any \u03c3 \u2208R I(\u03c9, \u03b2), the differential\nideal generated by \u03c9 and \u03b2 . In particular, if L is SL then L \u03b1 = 0 for any \u03b1 \u2208 I n ,\nwhere I n is the degree n part of I .\nFu [14] used these constraints to determine necessary conditions for a compact orientable\n(n \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional isotropic submanifold \u03a3 \u2282 Cn to bound a SL n\u2013fold. In many\nways this is the SL analogue of the Lagrangian Cobordism Problem, so we now briefly\nsummarize Fu's construction. For notational simplicity we will write \u03a9k for \u03a9k (M).\nConsider the following complex:\nd\n\nd\n\nd\n\n(\u03a90 , I 0 ) \u2192 . . . \u2192 (\u03a9k\u22121 , I k\u22121 ) \u2192 (\u03a9k , I k ) \u2192 * * * \u2192 (\u03a9m , I m ).\nLet Hk denote the corresponding (relative) cohomology groups. That is, we define\nZ k := {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a9k : d\u03b1 \u2208 I k+1 }\n\nand\n\nB k := d\u03a9k\u22121 + I k ,\n\nand then Hk is defined as the quotient space Hk := Z k /B k . Using the facts thatR \u03a3 is\nisotropic and that elements \u03b3 of I n\u22121 are of the form \u03b3 = \u03c9 \u2227 \u03b3 0 , it follows that \u03a3 [\u03b1]\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1516\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nis well-defined for all [\u03b1] \u2208 Hn\u22121 . If \u03a3 admits a smooth SL filling, then \u03a3 satisfies\nthe SL moment conditions\nZ\n[\u03b1] = 0, for all [\u03b1] \u2208 Hn\u22121 .\n\u03a3\n\nIn fact, even if \u03a3 is only the boundary of a (possibly singular) n\u2013dimensional SLrectifiable current then \u03a3 still satisfies these moments conditions. Furthermore, if \u03a3\nadmits a (possibly singular) SL filling, then any Lagrangian filling L of \u03a3 must satisfy\nthe condition\nZ\nd[\u03b1] = 0, for any [\u03b1] \u2208 Hn\u22121 .\nL\n\nHence the SL moment conditions are not sensitive enough to detect the difference\nbetween the existence of a smooth SL filling and a singular one. For example, the SL\nmoment conditions will be satisfied even if \u03a3 can only be filled by a singular SL cone.\nIn this sense Fu's moment conditions are strictly weaker than what one would need to\nsolve the \"smooth SL Cobordism Problem\". Furthermore, using an explicit description\nof the SL moment conditions in Cn (see below), Fu showed that there are isotropic\nmanifolds \u03a3 which satisfy all the SL moment conditions and yet do not bound any SL\nrectifiable current. This shows that the SL moment conditions are not sufficient for the\n\"singular SL Cobordism Problem\" either.\nWhen M = Cn , Fu was able to express the SL moment conditions very explicitly.\nIn particular he showed that the space Hn\u22121 is isomorphic to the space of functions\nf satisfying the condition LXf \u03b2 = 0, where L denotes Lie differentiation and Xf is\nthe Hamiltonian vector field generated by f . He then determined all such functions\nexplicitly; for n \u2265 3 they are exactly the hermitian harmonic quadratics defined\nfollowing Lemma 2.4 and arising from the Hamiltonian action of SU(n) n Cn on Cn .\nHence the SL moment conditions amount to exactly n(n + 2) independent conditions\non any compact orientable isotropic (n \u2212 1)\u2013manifold \u03a3 \u2282 Cn .\n\nA.4\n\nJoyce's SL gluing results\n\nIn the papers [33, 34] Joyce presents a series of results on the desingularization\nof certain kinds of singular SL submanifolds, which we have called SL conifolds.\nMore specifically, these papers deal with a compact SL n\u2013fold X in M with isolated\nsingularities x1 , . . . , xm (as in our Definition 6.1), satisfying two additional constraints.\nFirst, he assumes that each singularity xi is modelled metrically (in a precise sense)\non a regular SL cone Ci \u2282 Cn . Second, he assumes that there exists a smooth SL\nsubmanifold Li \u2282 Cn which is asymptotic (again, in a precise sense) to the cone Ci . He\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fSL singularities and the Lagrangian prescribed boundary problem\n\n1517\n\nthen proves that, under certain conditions, it is possible to remove a neighbourhood of\neach singular point xi in X and glue in a copy of Li so that, after a global perturbation,\nthe resulting submanifold Y is SL in M .\nThe simplest case in which Joyce obtains desingularization results is presented in [33,\nTheorem 6.13]. The first step in his process is to produce a Lagrangian gluing of each\nLi to X as follows. Let \u03a3i denote the link of the SL cone Ci . The use of Lagrangian\nneighbourhoods allows him to work inside the cotangent bundle T \u2217 (\u03a3i \u00d7 (0, \u221e)),\nendowed with its standard symplectic structure. More precisely, the gluing happens\ninside a small region of this bundle, T \u2217 (\u03a3i \u00d7 [t\u03c4 , 2t\u03c4 ]) (depending on parameters t, \u03c4 ).\nThere, the relevant regions of Li and X appear as the graphs of closed 1\u2013forms \u03c7i\nand \u03b7i respectively. Producing the required Lagrangian gluing reduces to proving\nthat there exists a closed 1\u2013form which interpolates between \u03c7i \u2208 T \u2217 (\u03a3i \u00d7 {t\u03c4 }) and\n\u03b7i \u2208 T \u2217 (\u03a3i \u00d7 {2t\u03c4 }). There is an obvious obstruction to doing this: the cone-like form\nof the metric on X close to each singular point xi implies (as in our Example 6.4) that \u03b7i\nis exact, so such an interpolation exists if and only if \u03c7i is also exact. The exactness of\n\u03c7i is an additional condition on Li which is encoded in Joyce's cohomological invariant\nY(Li ) (see [31, Definition 7.2]). Thus the Lagrangian gluing procedure just described is\npossible if and only if Y(Li ) = 0.\nThere are some strong similarities between the Lagrangian gluing procedure outlined\nabove and the methods we use, eg in Corollary 6.11. First of all, both are completely\nlocal in the sense that they perturb the original X only in a neighborhood of the\nsingularity, leaving the rest untouched. Second, in both cases (and for the same reasons)\nthe singularities are locally exact. The main difference is of course that Joyce relies on\nan a priori smoothing Li of Ci while we create our own smoothings using h\u2013principle\ntechniques. Thus in our case the role played by exactness is different from in Joyce's\nwork; in our setting it is a necessary condition for applying the h\u2013principle.\nThere are SL smoothings L of SL cones C which do not satisfy Y(L) = 0 [30, Example\n6.8]. For desingularizations based on these models, Joyce provides a second type of\nLagrangian gluing process which perturbs X globally. Again, the gluing is possible\nonly if a certain cohomological compatibility holds between the appropriate regions of\nLi and X .\nIt may also be useful to point out that the reason why Joyce is not concerned with\nMaslov-class type problems is that, by being careful in the Lagrangian gluing process,\nthe Lagrangian submanifolds he produces this way are almost SL (in a precise sense).\nThus they are automatically Maslov-zero. In conclusion, it is the whole set-up Joyce\nbegins with that allows him not to worry about the kind of topological questions we\naddress here, and instead concentrate on the analytic aspects of the SL condition.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1518\n\nMark Haskins and Tommaso Pacini\n\nRemark A.1 Joyce also has results for a SL analogue of the Lagrangian surgery\nprocedure explained in this Appendix, Section A.2. Once again, the starting point for\nthis is provided by explicit local models due to Lawlor. These models furnish local SL\ndesingularizations of certain pairs of SL planes, satisfying an angle condition. Again\none has no Maslov class problems because one can create an almost SL smoothing which\ntherefore has zero Maslov class. Joyce shows that any connected SL submanifold with\ntransverse self-intersection points modelled by such pairs of planes can be desingularized,\nleading to an embedded SL submanifold. The angle condition is always verified in\nthe n = 3 case. Joyce also provides results for a \"SL connect sum\" of smooth SL\nsubmanifolds which intersect one another transversely. Related results were obtained\nby A Butscher, Y I Lee and D Lee [8, 37, 36].\n\nReferences\n[1] V I Arnold, Lagrange and Legendre cobordisms I, Funktsional.
