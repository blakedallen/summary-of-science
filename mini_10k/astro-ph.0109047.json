Alcaniz2\nDepartamento de F\u0131\u0301sica, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte,\nC.P. 1641, 59072-970, Natal, Brasil\nABSTRACT\nWe investigate observational constraints on the cosmic equation of state from\nmeasurements of angular size for a large sample of milliarcsecond compact radiosources. The results are based on a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)\ntype models driven by non-relativistic matter plus a smooth dark energy component parametrized by its equation of state px = \u03c9\u03c1x (\u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 < 0). The allowed\nintervals for \u03c9 and \u03a9m are heavily dependent on the value of the mean projected\nlinear size l. For l \u2243 20h\u22121 \u2212 30h\u22121 pc, we find \u03a9m \u2264 0.62, \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.2 and\n\u03a9m \u2264 0.17, \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.65 (68% c.l.), respectively. As a general result, this analysis\nshows that if one minimizes \u03c72 for the parameters l, \u03a9m and \u03c9, the conventional\nflat \u039bCDM model (\u03c9 = \u22121) with \u03a9m = 0.2 and l = 22.6h\u22121 pc is the best fit for\nthese angular size data.\nSubject headings: cosmology: theory \u2013 dark matter \u2013 distance scale\nA large number of recent observational evidences strongly suggest that we live in a flat,\naccelerating Universe composed by \u223c 1/3 of matter (barionic + dark) and \u223c 2/3 of an exotic\ncomponent with large negative pressure, usually named dark energy or \"quintessence\". The\nbasic set of experiments includes: observations from SNe Ia (Perlmutter et al. 1998; 1999;\nRiess et al. 1998), CMB anisotropies (de Bernardis et al. 2000), large scale structure (Bahcall 2000), age estimates of globular clusters (Carretta et al. 2000; Krauss 2000; Rengel et al.\n20001) and old high redshift galaxies (OHRG's) (Dunlop 1996; Krauss 1997; Alcaniz & Lima\n1999; Alcaniz & Lima 2001). It is now believed that such results provide the remaining piece\nof information connecting the inflationary flatness prediction (\u03a9T = 1) with astronomical\n1\n\nlimajas@dfte.ufrn.br\n\n2\n\nalcaniz@dfte.ufrn.br\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nobservations, and, perhaps more important from a theoretical viewpoint, they have stimulated the current interest for more general models containing an extra component describing\nthis unknown dark energy, and simultaneously accounting for the present accelerated stage\nof the Universe.\nThe absence of a convincing evidence concerning the nature of this dark component\ngave origin to an intense debate and mainly to many theoretical speculations in the last few\nyears. Some possible candidates for \"quintessence\" are: a vacuum decaying energy density,\nor a time varying \u039b-term (Ozer & Taha 1987; Freese 1987; Carvalho et al 1992, Lima and\nMaia 1994), a relic scalar field (Peebles & Ratra 1988; Frieman et al 1995; Caldwell et al\n1998; Saini et al 2000) or still an extra component, the so-called \"X-matter\", which is simply\ncharacterized by an equation of state px = \u03c9\u03c1x , where \u03c9 \u2265 \u22121 (Turner & White 1997; Chiba\net al 1997) and includes, as a particular case, models with a cosmological constant (\u039bCDM)\n(Peebles 1984). For \"X-matter\" models, several results suggest \u03a9x \u2243 0.7 and \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.6.\nFor example, studies from gravitational lensing + SNe Ia provide \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.7 at 68% c.l.\n(Waga & Miceli 1999; see also Dev et al. 2001). Limits from age estimates of old galaxies\nat high redshifts require \u03c9 < \u22120.27 for \u03a9m \u2243 0.3 (Lima & Alcaniz 2000a). In addition,\nconstraints from large scale structure (LSS) and cosmic microwave background anisotropies\n(CMB) complemented by the SN Ia data, require 0.6 \u2264 \u03a9x \u2264 0.7 and \u03c9 < \u22120.6 (95% c.l.)\nfor a flat universe (Garnavich et al 1998; Perlmutter et al 1999; Efstathiou 1999), while for\nuniverses with arbitrary spatial curvature these data provide \u03c9 < \u22120.4 (Efstathiou 1999).\nOn the other hand, although carefully investigated in many of their theoretical and observational aspects, an overview on the literature shows that a quantitative analysis on the\ninfluence of a \"quintessence\" component (\u03c9 = px /\u03c1x ) in some kinematic tests like angular\nsize-redshift relation still remains to be analysed. Recently, Lima & Alcaniz (2000b) studied\nsome qualitative aspects of this test in the context of such models, with particular emphasis\nfor the critical redshift zm at which the angular size takes its minimal value. As a general\nconclusion, it was shown that this critical redshift cannot discriminate between world models since different scenarios can provide similar values of zm (see also Krauss & Schramm\n1993). This situation is not improved even if evolutionary effects are taken into account. In\nparticular, for the observationally favoured open universe (\u03a9m = 0.3) we found zm = 1.89,\na value that can also be obtained for quintessence models having 0.85 \u2264 \u03a9x \u2264 0.93 and\n\u22121 \u2264 \u03c9x \u2264 \u22120.5. Qualitatively, it was also argued that if the predicted zm is combinated\nwith other tests, some interesting cosmological constraints can be obtained.\nIn this letter, we focus our attention on a more quantitative analysis. We consider the\n\u03b8 \u2212 z data of compact radio sources recently updated and extended by Gurvits et al. (1999)\nto constrain the cosmic equation of state. We show that a good agreement between theory\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nand observation is possible if \u03a9m \u2264 0.62, \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.2 and \u03a9m \u2264 0.17, \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.65 (68% c.l.)\nfor values of the mean projected linear size between l \u2243 20h\u22121 \u2212 30h\u22121 pc, respectively. In\nparticular we find that a conventional cosmological constant model (\u03c9 = \u22121) with \u03a9m = 0.2\nand l = 22.64h\u22121 pc is the best fit model for these data with \u03c72 = 4.51 for 9 degrees of\nfreedom.\nFor spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic cosmologies driven by nonrelativistic matter plus an exotic component with equation of state, px = \u03c9\u03c1x , the Einstein field equations\ntake the following form:\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u1e58 2\nRo 3\nRo 3(1+\u03c9)\n2\n( ) = Ho \u03a9m ( ) + \u03a9x ( )\n,\n(1)\nR\nR\nR\n\u0015\n\u0014\nR\u0308\n1 2\nRo 3\nRo 3(1+\u03c9)\n,\n(2)\n= \u2212 Ho \u03a9m ( ) + (3\u03c9 + 1)\u03a9x ( )\nR\n2\nR\nR\nwhere an overdot denotes derivative with respect to time, Ho = 100hKms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 is the\npresent value of the Hubble parameter, and \u03a9m and \u03a9x are the present day matter and\nquintessence density parameters. As one may check from (1) and (2), the case \u03c9 = \u22121\ncorresponds effectively to a cosmological constant.\nIn such a background, the angular size-redshift relation for a rod of intrinsic length l\ncan be written as (Sandage 1988)\n\u03b8(z) =\n\nD(1 + z)\n\u03be(z)\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nIn the above expression D is the angular-size scale expressed in milliarcseconds (marcs)\nD=\n\n100lh\n,\nc\n\n(4)\n\nwhere l is measured in parsecs (for compact radio-sources), and the dimensionless coordinate\n\u03be is given by (Lima & Alcaniz 2000b)\nZ 1\ndx\n(5)\n\u03be(z) =\n1 .\n(1+z)\u22121 x [\u03a9m x\u22121 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m )x\u2212(1+3\u03c9) ] 2\nThe above equations imply that for given values of l, \u03a9m and \u03c9, the predicted value of\n\u03b8(z) is completely determined. Two points, however, should be stressed before discussing\nthe resulting diagrams. First of all, the determination of \u03a9m and \u03c9 are strongly dependent\non the adopted value of l. In this case, instead of assuming a especific value for the mean\nprojected linear size, we have worked on the interval l \u2243 20h\u22121 \u2212 30h\u22121 pc, i.e., l \u223c O(40)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\npc for h = 0.65, or equivalently, D = 1.4 \u2212 2.0 marcs. Second, following Kellermann (1993),\nwe assume that possible evolutionary effects can be removed out from this sample because\ncompact radio jets are (i) typically less than a hundred parsecs in extent, and, therefore,\ntheir morphology and kinematics do not depend considerably on the intergalactic medium\nand (ii) they have typical ages of some tens of years, i.e., they are very young compared to\nthe age of the Universe.\nIn our analysis we consider the angular size data for milliarcsecond radio-sources recently\ncompiled by Gurvits et al. (1999). This data set, originally composed by 330 sources\ndistributed over a wide range of redshifts (0.011 \u2264 z \u2264 4.72), was reduced to 145 sources\nwith spectral index \u22120.38 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 0.18 and total luminosity Lh2 \u2265 1026 W/Hz in order\nto minimize any possible dependence of angular size on spectral index and/or linear size on\nluminosity. This new sample was distributed into 12 bins with 12-13 sources per bin (see Fig.\n1). In order to determine the cosmological parameters \u03a9m and \u03c9, we use a \u03c72 minimization\nneglecting the unphysical region \u03a9m < 0,\n2\n\n\u03c7 (l, \u03a9m , \u03c9) =\n\n12\nX\n[\u03b8(zi , l, \u03a9m , \u03c9) \u2212 \u03b8oi ]2\ni=1\n\n\u03c3i2\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03b8(zi , l, \u03a9m , \u03c9) is given by Eqs. (3) and (5) and \u03b8oi is the observed values of the angular\nsize with errors \u03c3i of the ith bin in the sample.\nFigure 1 displays the binned data of the median angular size plotted against redshift.\nThe curves represent flat quintessence models with \u03a9m = 0.3 and some selected values of\n\u03c9. As discussed in Lima & Alcaniz (2000b), the standard open model (thick line) may be\ninterpreted as an intermediary case between \u039bCDM (\u03c9 = \u22121) and quintessence models with\n\u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.5. In Fig. 2 we show contours of constant likelihood (95% and 68%) in the plane\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9m for the interval l \u2243 20h\u22121 \u2212 30h\u22121 pc. For l = 20.58h\u22121 pc (D = 1.4 marcs), the best\nfit occurs for \u03a9m = 0.26 and \u03c9 = \u22120.86. As can be seen there, this assumption provides\n\u03a9m \u2264 0.48 and \u03c9 = \u22120.3 at 1\u03c3. In the subsequent panels of the same figure similar analyses\nare displayed for l \u2243 22.05h\u22121 pc (D = 1.5 marcs), l \u2243 23.53h\u22121 pc (D = 1.6 marcs) and\nl \u2243 29.41h\u22121 pc (D = 2.0 marcs), respectively. As should be physically expected, the limits\nare now much more restrictive than in the previous case because for the same values of \u03b8oi\nit is needed larger \u03be(z) (for larger l) and, therefore, smaller values of \u03c9. For l \u2243 29.41h\u22121\npc, we find \u03a9m = 0.04 and \u03c9 = \u22121 as the best fit model. For intermediate values of l,\nnamely, l = 22.0h\u22121 pc (D = 1.5 marcs) and l = 23.5h\u22121 pc (D = 1.6 marcs), we have\n\u03a9m = 0.22, \u03c9 = \u22120.98 and \u03a9m = 0.16 and \u03c9 = \u22121, respectively. In particular, for smaller\nvalues of l, e.g., l \u2243 14.70h\u22121 pc (D = 1.0 marcs) we find \u03a9m = 0.36, \u03c9 = \u22120.04. As\na general result (independent of the choice of l), if we minimize \u03c72 for l, \u03a9m and \u03c9, we\nobtain l = 22.64h\u22121 pc (D = 1.54 marcs), \u03a9m = 0.2 and \u03c9 = \u22121 with \u03c72 = 4.51 for 9\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ndegrees of freedom (see Table 1). It is worth notice that our results are rather different\nfrom those presented by Jackson & Dodgson (1996) based on the original Kellermann's data\n(Kellermann 1993). They argued that the Kellermann's compilation favours open and highly\ndecelerating models with negative cosmological constant. Later on, they considered a bigger\nsample of 256 sources selected from the compilation of Gurvits (1994) and concluded that the\nstandard flat CDM model is ruled out at 98.5% confidence level whereas low-density models\nwith a cosmological constant of either sign are favoured (Jackson & Dodgson 1997). More\nrecently, Vishwakarma (2001) used the updated data of Gurvits et al. (1999) to compare\nvarying and constant \u039bCDM models. He concluded that flat \u039bCDM models with \u03a9m = 0.2\nare favoured.\nAt this point it is also interesting to compare our results with some recent determinations of \u03c9 derived from independent methods. Recently, Garnavich et al. (1998) using the\nSNe Ia data from the High-Z Supernova Search Team found \u03c9 < \u22120.55 (95% c.l.) for flat\nmodels whatever the value of \u03a9m whereas for arbitrary geometry they obtained \u03c9 < \u22120.6\n(95% c.l.). As commented there, these values are inconsistent with an unknown component\nlike topological defects (domain walls, string, and textures) for which \u03c9 = \u2212 n3 , being n the\ndimension of the defect. The results by Garnavich et al. (1998) agree with the constraints\nobtained from a wide variety of different phenomena (Wang et al. 1999), using the \"concordance cosmic\" method. Their combined maximum likelihood analysis suggests \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.6,\nwhich is less stringent than the upper limits derived here for values of l \u2265 20h\u22121 pc. More\nrecently, Balbi et al. (2001) investigated CMB anisotropies in quintessence models by using the MAXIMA-1 and BOOMERANG-98 published bandpowers in combination with the\nCOBE/DMR results (see also Corasaniti & Copeland 2001). Their analysis sugests \u03a9x > 0.7\nand \u22121 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.5 whereas Jain et al (2001) found, by using image separation distribution\nfunction of lensed quasars, \u22120.75 \u2264 \u03c9 \u2264 \u22120.42, for the observed range of \u03a9m \u223c 0.2 \u2212 0.4\n(Dekel et al. 1997). These and other recents results are summarized in Table 2.\nLet us now discuss briefly these angular size constraints whether the adopted X-matter\nmodel is replaced by a scalar field motivated cosmology, as for instance, that one proposed by\nPeebles and Ratra (1988). These models are defined by power law potentials, V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c6\u2212\u03b1 ,\nin such a way that the parameter of the effective equation of state (w\u03c6 = p\u03c6 /\u03c1\u03c6 ) may become\nconstant at late times (or for a given era). In this case, as shown elsewhere (Lima & Alcaniz\n2000c), the dimensionless quantity \u03be defining the angular size reads\nZ 1\ndx\n\u03be(z) =\n(7)\n4\u2212\u03b1 1 .\n(1+z)\u22121 x[\u03a9m x\u22121 + (1 \u2212 \u03a9m )x 2+\u03b1 ] 2\nComparing the above expression with (5) we see that if \u03c9 = \u22122/(2 + \u03b1) this class of models\nmay reproduce faithfully the X-matter constraints based on the angular size observations\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\npresented here. However, as happens with the Supernovae type Ia data (Podariu & Ratra\n2000), the two sets of confidence contours may differ significantly if one goes beyond the\ntime independent equation of state approximation. Naturally, a similar behavior is expected\nif generic scalar field potentials are considered.\nFinally, we stress that measurements of angular size from distant sources provide an\nimportant test for world models. However, in order to improve the results a statistical\nstudy describing the intrinsic lenght distribution of the sources seems to be of fundamental importance. On the other hand, in the absence of such analysis but living in the era\nof precision cosmology, one may argue that reasonable values for astrophysical quantities\n(like the characteristic linear size l) can be infered from the best cosmological model. As\nobserved by Gurvits (1994), such an estimative could be useful for any kind of study envolving physical parameters of active galactic nuclei (AGN). In principle, by knowing l and\nassuming a physical model for AGN, a new method to estimate the Hubble parameter could\nbe established.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to L. I.
