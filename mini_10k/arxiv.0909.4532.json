Introduction\nThe problem of formulating supersymmetric theories on lattices has a long history going back\nto the earliest days of lattice gauge theory. However, after initial efforts failed to produce useful\nsupersymmetric lattice actions the topic languished for many years. Indeed a folklore developed\nthat supersymmetry and the lattice were mutually incompatible. However, recently, the problem\nhas been re-examined using new tools and ideas such as topological twisting, orbifold projection\nand deconstruction and a class of lattice models have been constructed which maintain one or more\nsupersymmetries exactly at non-zero lattice spacing.\nWhile in low dimensions there are many continuum supersymmetric theories that can be\ndiscretized this way, in four dimensions there appears to a unique solution to the constraints \u2013\nN = 4 super Yang-Mills. The availability of a supersymmetric lattice construction for this theory\nis clearly very exciting from the point of view of exploring the connection between gauge theories\nand string/gravitational theories. But even without this connection to string theory it is clearly of\ngreat importance to be able to give a non-perturbative formulation of a supersymmetric theory via\na lattice path integral in the same way that one can formally define QCD as a limit of lattice QCD\nas the lattice spacing goes to zero and the box size to infinity. From a practical point of view one\ncan also hope that some of the technology of lattice field theory such as strong coupling expansions\nand Monte Carlo simulation can be brought to bear on such supersymmetric theories.\nIn this talk I will outline some of the key ingredients that go into these constructions, the kinds\nof applications that have been considered so far and highlight the remaining difficulties.\nFirst, let me explain why discretization of supersymmetric theories resisted solution for so\nlong. The central problem is that naive discretizations of continuum supersymmetric theories break\nsupersymmetry completely and radiative effects lead to a profusion of relevant supersymmetry\nbreaking counterterms in the renormalized lattice action. The coefficients to these counterterms\nmust then be carefully fine tuned as the lattice spacing is sent to zero in order to arrive at a supersymmetric theory in the continuum limit. In most cases this is both unnatural and practically\nimpossible \u2013 particularly if the theory contains scalar fields. Of course, one might have expected\nproblems \u2013 the supersymmetry algebra is an extension of the Poincar\u00e9 algebra which is explicitly\nbroken on the lattice. Specifically, there are no infinitesimal translation generators on a discrete\nspacetime so that the algebra {Q, Q} = \u03b3\u03bc p\u03bc is already broken at the classical level. Equivalently it\nis a straightforward exercise to show that a naive supersymmetry variation of a naively discretized\nsupersymmetric theory fails to yield zero as a consequence of the failure of the Leibniz rule when\napplied to lattice difference operators1 .\nIn the last five years or so this problem has been revisited using new theoretical tools and\nideas and a set of lattice models have been constructed which retain exactly some of the continuum\nsupersymmetry at non-zero lattice spacing. The basic idea is to maintain a particular subalgebra\nof the full supersymmetry algebra in the lattice theory. The hope is that this exact symmetry\nwill constrain the effective lattice action and protect the theory from dangerous susy violating\ncounterterms.\n1 Significant\n\nwork has gone into generalizing the Leibniz rule to finite difference operators in the context of noncommutative models using the techniques of Hopf algebras see [1, 2, 3]. This approach will not be discussed in this\ntalk\n\n2\n\n\fSimon Catterall\n\nSupersymmetric lattices\n\nTwo approaches have been pursued to produce such supersymmetric actions; one based on\nideas drawn from the field of topological field theory [7, 8, 9, 10] and another pioneered by David B.\nKaplan and collaborators using ideas of orbifolding and deconstruction [4, 5, 6]. Remarkably these\ntwo seemingly independent approaches lead to the same lattice theories \u2013 see [11, 12, 13, 14] and\nthe recent reviews [15, 16]. This convergence of two seemingly completely different approaches\nleads one to suspect that the final lattice theories may represent essentially unique solutions to the\nsimultaneous requirements of locality, gauge invariance and at least one exact supersymmetry. We\nwill only have time to discuss the approach via topological twisting in this talk.\n\n2. Topological twisting\nPerhaps the simplest way to understand how this subalgebra emerges is to reformulate the\ntarget theory in terms of \"twisted fields\". The basic idea of twisting goes back to Witten in his\nseminal paper on topological field theory [17] but actually had been anticipated in earlier work on\nstaggered fermions [18]. In our context the idea is decompose the fields of the theory in terms of\nrepresentations not of the original (Euclidean) rotational symmetry SOrot (D) but a twisted rotational\nsymmetry which is the diagonal subgroup of this symmetry and an SOR (D) subgroup of the Rsymmetry of the theory.\nSO(D)0 = diag(SOLorentz (D) \u00d7 SOR (D))\n(2.1)\nTo be explicit consider the case where the total number of supersymmetries is Q = 2D . In this case\nI can treat the supercharges of the twisted theory as a 2D/2 \u00d7 2D/2 matrix q. This matrix can be\nexpanded on products of gamma matrices\nq = QI + Q\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc + Q\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3\u03bc \u03b3n u + . . .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe 2D antisymmetric tensor components that arise in this basis are the twisted supercharges and\nsatisfy a corresponding supersymmetry algebra following from the original algebra\nQ2 = 0\n{Q, Q\u03bc } = p\u03bc\n***\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\nThe presence of the nilpotent scalar supercharge Q is most important; it is the algebra of this\ncharge that we can hope to translate to the lattice. The second piece of the algebra expresses the\nfact that the momentum is the Q-variation of something which makes plausible the statement that\nthe energy-momentum tensor and hence the entire action can be written in Q-exact form2 . Notice\nthat an action written in such a Q-exact form is trivially invariant under the scalar supersymmetry\nprovided the latter remains nilpotent under discretization.\nThe rewriting of the supercharges in terms of twisted variables can be repeated for the fermions\nof the theory and yields a set of antisymmetric tensors (\u03b7, \u03c8\u03bc , \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd , . . .) which for the case of Q = 2D\nmatches the number of components of a real K\u00e4hler-Dirac field. This repackaging of the fermions\n2 Actually\n\nin the case of N = 4 there is an additional Q-closed term needed\n\n3\n\n\fSimon Catterall\n\nSupersymmetric lattices\n\nof the theory into a K\u00e4hler-Dirac field is at the heart of how the discrete theory avoids fermion\ndoubling as was shown by Becher, Joos and Rabin in the early days of lattice gauge theory [19, 20].\nIt is important to recognize that the transformation to twisted variables corresponds to a simple\nchange of variables in flat space \u2013 one more suitable to discretization. A true topological field\ntheory only results when the scalar charge is treated as a true BRST charge and attention is restricted\nto states annihilated by this charge. In the language of the supersymmetric parent theory such a\nrestriction corresponds to a projection to the vacua of the theory. It is not employed in these lattice\nconstructions.\n\n3. An example: 2D super Yang-Mills\nThis theory satisfies our requirements for supersymmetric latticization; its R-symmetry possesses an SO(2) subgroup corresponding to rotations of the its two degenerate Majorana fermions\ninto each other. Explicitly the theory can be written in twisted form as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n1\nS = 2 Q Tr \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b7[D \u03bc , D\u03bc ] \u2212 \u03b7d\n(3.1)\ng\n2\nThe degrees of freedom are just the twisted fermions (\u03b7, \u03c8\u03bc , \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd ) previously described and a complex gauge field A\u03bc . The latter is built from the usual gauge field and the two scalars present in the\nuntwisted theory A\u03bc = A\u03bc + iB\u03bc with corresponding complexified field strength F\u03bc\u03bd .\nNotice that the original scalar fields transform as vectors under the original R-symmetry and\nhence become vectors under the twisted rotation group while the gauge fields are singlets under\nthe R-symmetry and so remain vectors under twisted rotations. This structure makes possible the\nappearance of a complex gauge field in the twisted theory. Notice though,that the theory is only\ninvariant under the usual U(N) gauge symmetry and not its complexified cousin.\nThe nilpotent transformations associated with Q are given explicitly by\nQ A\u03bc = \u03c8\u03bc\nQ \u03c8\u03bc = 0\nQA\u03bc = 0\nQ \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212F \u03bc\u03bd\nQ\u03b7 = d\nQd = 0\nPerforming the Q-variation and integrating out the auxiliary field d yields\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\n1\n2\nS = 2 Tr \u2212F \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd + [D \u03bc , D\u03bc ] \u2212 \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd D[\u03bc \u03c8 \u03bd] \u2212 \u03b7D \u03bc \u03c8\u03bc\ng\n2\n\n(3.2)\n\nTo untwist the theory and verify that indeed in flat space it just corresponds to the usual theory\none can do a further integration by parts to produce\nS=\n\n1\ng2\n\nZ\n\n2\nTr \u2212F\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 2B\u03bc D\u03bd D\u03bd B\u03bc \u2212 [B\u03bc , B\u03bd ]2 + LF\n\n4\n\n\u0001\n\n(3.3)\n\n\fSimon Catterall\n\nSupersymmetric lattices\n\nwhere F\u03bc\u03bd is the usual Yang-Mills term. It is now clear that the imaginary parts of the gauge fields\nB\u03bc can now be given an interpretation as scalar fields in this parameterization. Similarly one can\nbuild spinors out of the twisted fermions and write the action in the manifestly Dirac form\n!\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u2212D \u2212 iB D + iB\n\u03c8\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\nLF = \u03c712 \u03b72\n(3.4)\nD1 \u2212 iB1 D2 \u2212 iB2\n\u03c82\n\n4. Discretization\nThe prescription for discretization is somewhat natural. (Complex) gauge fields are represented as complexified Wilson gauge links U\u03bc (x) = eA\n\u03bc (x) living on links of a lattice which for the\nmoment we can think of as hypercubic. These transform in the usual way under U(N) lattice gauge\ntransformations\nU\u03bc (x) \u2192 G(x)U\u03bc (x)G\u2020 (x)\n(4.1)\nSupersymmetric invariance then implies that \u03c8\u03bc (x) live on the same links and transform identically.\nThe scalar fermion \u03b7(x) is clearly most naturally associated with a site and transforms accordingly\n\u03b7(x) \u2192 G(x)\u03b7(x)G\u2020 (x)\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe field \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd is slightly more difficult. Naturally as a 2-form it should be associated with a plaquette. In practice we introduce diagonal links running through the center of the plaquette and choose\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd to lie with opposite orientation along those diagonal links. This choice of orientation will be\nnecessary to ensure gauge invariance.\n\nTo complete the discretization we need to describe how continuum derivatives are to be replaced by difference operators. A natural technology for accomplishing this in the case of adjoint\nfields was developed many years ago and yields expressions for the derivative operator applied to\narbitrary lattice p-forms [21]. In the case discussed here we need just two derivatives given by the\nexpressions\n(+)\n\nD\u03bc f\u03bd = U\u03bc (x) f\u03bd (x + \u03bc) \u2212 f\u03bd (x)U\u03bc (x + \u03bd)\n\n(4.3)\n\n(\u2212)\n\nD \u03bc f \u03bc = f \u03bc (x)U \u03bc (x) \u2212 U \u03bc (x \u2212 \u03bc) f \u03bc (x \u2212 \u03bc)\n\n(4.4)\n(+)\n\nThe lattice field strength is then given by the gauged forward difference F\u03bc\u03bd = D\u03bc U\u03bd and is\nautomatically antisymmetric in its indices. Furthermore it transforms like a lattice 2-form and\nyields a gauge invariant loop on the lattice when contracted with \u03c7\u03bc\u03bd . Similarly the covariant\nbackward difference appearing in D \u03bc U\u03bc transforms as a 0-form or site field and hence can be\ncontracted with the site field \u03b7.\n5\n\n\fSimon Catterall\n\nSupersymmetric lattices\n\nThis use of forward and backward difference operators guarantees that the solutions of the\ntheory map one-to-one with the solutions of the continuum theory and hence fermion doubling\nproblems are evaded. Indeed, by introducing a lattice with half the lattice spacing one can map this\nK\u00e4hler-Dirac fermion action into the action for staggered fermions. Notice that, unlike the case of\nQCD, there is no rooting problem in this supersymmetric construction since the additional fermion\ndegeneracy is already required by the continuum theory.\n\n5. Twisted N = 4 super Yang-Mills\nIn four dimensions the constraint that the target theory possess 16 supercharges singles out a\nsingle theory for which this construction can be undertaken \u2013 N = 4 SYM.\nThe continuum twist of N = 4 that is the starting point of the twisted lattice construction was\nfirst written down by Marcus in 1995 [22] although it now plays a important role in the GeometricLanglands program and is hence sometimes called the GL-twist [23]. This four dimensional twisted\ntheory is most compactly expressed as the dimensional reduction of a five dimensional theory in\nwhich the ten (one gauge field and six scalars) bosonic fields are realized as the components of a\ncomplexified five dimensional gauge field while the 16 twisted fermions naturally span one of the\ntwo K\u00e4hler-Dirac fields needed in five dimensions. Remarkably, the action of this theory contains a\nQ-exact piece of precisely the same form as the two dimensional theory given in eqn. 3.1 provided\none extends the field labels to run now from one to five. In addition the Marcus twist requires a\nnew Q-closed term which was not possible in the two dimensional theory.\nZ\n1\nSclosed = \u2212\n(5.1)\nTr \u03b5mnpqr \u03c7qr D p \u03c7mn\n8\nThe supersymmetric invariance of this term then relies on the Bianchi identity \u03b5mnpqrD p Fqr = 0.\nThe lattice that emerges from examining the moduli space of the lattice theory is called A\u22174\nand is constructed from the set of five basis vectors va pointing out from the center of a four\ndimensional equilateral simplex out to its vertices together with their inverses \u2212va . It is the four\ndimensional analog of the 3D bcc lattice. Complexified Wilson gauge link variables Ua are placed\non these links together with their Q-superpartners \u03c8a . Another 10 fermions are associated with the\ndiagonal links va + vb with a > b. Finally, the exact scalar supersymmetry implies the existence of a\nsingle fermion for every lattice site. The lattice action corresponds to a discretization of the Marcus\ntwist on this A\u22174 lattice and can be represented as a set of traced closed bosonic and fermionic loops.\nIt is invariant under the exact Q scalar susy, lattice gauge transformations and a global permutation\nsymmetry S5 and can be proven free of fermion doubling problems as discussed before.\nWhile the supersymmetric invariance of the Q-exact term is manifest in the lattice theory it is\nnot clear how to discretize the continuum Q-closed term. Remarkably, it is possible to discretize\neqn. 5.1 in such a way that it is indeed exactly invariant under the twisted supersymmetry! The\ndiscrete gauge invariant form is given by\n1\n(\u2212)\nSclosed = \u2212 \u2211 Tr \u03b5mnpqr \u03c7qr (x + \u03bcm + \u03bcn + \u03bc p )D p \u03c7mn (x + \u03bc p )\n(5.2)\n8 x\nand can be seen to be supersymmetric since the lattice field strength satisfies an exact Bianchi\nidentity of the form\n(+)\n\u03b5mnpqr D p Fqr = 0\n(5.3)\n6\n\n\fSimon Catterall\n\nSupersymmetric lattices\n\n6. Prospects\nOne of the key issues that still remains to be explored is the question of how much residual fine\ntuning will be required to achieve a continuum limit in which full supersymmetry is restored. This\nis controlled by the flows in all relevant operators which could be induced in the effective action\nas a result of quantum corrections. We have used the exact lattice symmetries together with power\ncounting to enumerate the possible set of such lattice operators.\nOnly three terms appear and two of these correspond to renormalizations of kinetic terms\nalready present in the bare lattice action. There is one additional term of the form\n\u03b7U\u03bc U \u03bc\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhich leads to supersymmetric mass terms for the fermions and scalars.\nThe question of the restoration of full supersymmetry then rests on whether the ratios of the coefficients to these operators flow away from their classical values as the lattice spacing is decreased.\nA one loop calculation is in progress which should shed light on this issue.\nBeyond this issue it would be very interesting to use Monte Carlo simulation to test the aspects\nof the AdS/CFT conjecture. Parallel code has been developed to study N = 4 super Yang-Mills.\nAt finite temperature this theory and its dimensional reductions should be dual to a variety of black\nhole solution in supergravity. We hope to report on the results of these soon. One would hope\nthat the results of such simulations could be useful in the quest to understand how aspects of the\nquantum geometry can be understood in terms of the dual gauge theory.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
