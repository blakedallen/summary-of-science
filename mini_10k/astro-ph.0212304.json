Until fairly recently, the paucity of X-ray data from\nthese objects was notable, but now sensitive hard-band missions such as Chandra and XMM-Newton are\nroutinely detecting broad absorption line quasars. The X-ray regime offers qualitatively new information for\nthe understanding of these objects, and these new results must be taken into account in theoretical modeling\nof quasar winds.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nRecent studies of the strong correlations between black hole masses and the properties of their hosts'\ngalactic bulges (e.g., Ferrarese and Merritt, 2000; Gebhardt et al., 2000) demonstrate clearly the intimate\ninterrelation between the growth of black holes and their host galaxies. This connection implies a physical\nmechanism for regulating the coeval development of these structures. During the bulk of their accretion\nphases, supermassive black holes apparently reveal themselves as luminous quasars (e.g., Yu and Tremaine,\n2002), and thus quasar winds are likely to provide a primary source of feedback. These winds are directly\nobserved in the population of Broad Absorption Line (BAL) quasars, \u223c 10% of the quasar population\nthat exhibit deep, broad absorption lines from high-ionization UV resonance transitions. Such blueshifted\nabsorption features are understood to arise along lines of sight which pass through radiatively driven winds\nwith terminal velocities reaching 0.1\u20130.3c. These energetic outflows are important components of quasar\nenvironments; mass ejection is apparently fundamentally linked to active mass accretion. X-rays, generated\nin the innermost region surrounding accreting black holes, travel through the nuclear environments to the\nobserver. X-ray studies of BAL quasars thus offer a privileged view through the wind.\nThe challenge of accelerating gas to the high velocities observed in BAL quasars led Murray et al. (1995)\nto a picture similar to that presented in Figure 1. In this model, at radii starting at \u223c 1016 cm for a\n108 M\u2299 black hole, radiation and gas pressure lift material from the disk photosphere where it is struck by\nlight from the inner accretion disk and corona. The wind, initially co-rotating with the disk, is accelerated\nradially by the momentum of UV line photons; the material launched from the innermost radii reaches the\nhighest terminal velocities. In order to launch the wind at such small distances, a thick layer of \"shielding\"\ngas, highly ionized plasma with NH = 1022 \u20131024 cm\u22122 , was introduced to protect the wind from becoming\ncompletely ionized by soft X-rays. In the subsequent hydrodynamical modeling of line-driven quasar winds\nby Proga, Stone, and Kallman (2000), this layer of shielding gas arose naturally from the simulations. This\nscenario produces several predictions for X-ray observations of BAL quasars:\n\n\f2\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\nBAL Wind\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000 Shielding\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\nGas\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\nAccretion Disk\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n\n111111\n000000\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n000000\n111111\n\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n00000000000000\n11111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n000000000000000\n111111111111111\n\nFig. 1. Diagram of a possible geometry for the nucleus of a BAL quasar based on the Murray et al. (1995)\nmodel. The patterned gray circle represents the X-ray emitting region surrounding the black hole. The region of\nhighly ionized plasma marked \"Shielding Gas\" was postulated to shield the BAL wind (with a scale of light days)\nfrom soft X-ray and extreme UV radiation. These photons would otherwise strip the gas in the wind of electrons,\nthus preventing it from being radiatively driven by UV line pressure.\n\u2022 BAL quasars should have intrinsic X-ray continuum shapes (with \u0393 = 2.0 \u00b1 0.3; e.g., George et al.,\n2000) and spectral energy distributions typical of radio-quiet quasars.\n1\n\u2022 All BAL quasars should be X-ray weak, i.e., have values of \u03b1ox <\n\u223c \u22122.0, as a result of large column\ndensities of absorbing gas. Furthermore, with data of sufficient quality, the spectra will show the\nsignatures of absorption by highly ionized gas.\n\u2022 A correlation between the minimum absorption velocity and \u03b1ox is likely to arise due to effects of\norientation. For example, a line of sight close to the accretion disk will pass through more X-ray\nabsorbing gas, and the minimum observed UV absorption velocity will be close to zero as the gas\noutflow is primarily transverse to the line of sight.\nThe sample of BAL quasars observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton is steadily growing, and the current\nX-ray data are now of sufficient quality to investigate these predictions directly. In this paper, we summarize the insights offered from both exploratory and spectroscopic X-ray surveys of BAL quasars to the\nunderstanding of quasar winds.\nRESULTS FROM EXPLORATORY SURVEYS\nGiven the extreme faintness of BAL quasars in the soft X-ray regime (e.g., Kopko et al., 1994; Green and\nMathur, 1996), obtaining detailed spectroscopic information requires a significant commitment of observatory time. In this situation, only a small fraction of the population will have data of spectroscopic quality,\nand there is a legitimate danger that the conclusions drawn from such limited, potentially biased samples\nwill not be representative of the population as a whole. Pursuing an alternate strategy of exploratory observations enables much larger numbers of BAL quasars to be observed with the goal of measuring X-ray flux,\nhardness ratio, and \u03b1ox for each object. The low background and excellent spatial resolution of Chandra\n\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the\nallow short, exploratory observations of 5\u20137 ks to reach sensitive flux limits of <\n\u223c 10\n0.5\u20138.0 keV band (Green et al., 2001; Gallagher et al., 2002a).\nWe are in the process of compiling the largest exploratory survey to date, with a well-defined sample of\nBAL quasars drawn from the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS; Foltz et al., 1989; Hewett et al., 1995).\nThis sample of z > 1.352 BAL quasars is comprised of 22 objects with publicly available rest-frame UV\nspectroscopy from Weymann et al. (1991). To date, 15 of the 20 objects observed have been detected, and\nthe remainder have tight upper limits on both X-ray flux and \u03b1ox (Gallagher et al., 2002a, in prep.).\nThough the BAL quasars in our sample are indeed weak in X-rays with a median value of \u03b1ox = \u22122.2\n(see Figure 2), they are generally detectable with the current generation of X-ray observatories. For those\n1\n\nThe quantity \u03b1ox measures the relative flux densities at rest-frame 2 keV and 2500 \u00c5. For reference, a sample of low-redshift\nradio-quiet quasars without known absorption has \u03b1ox = \u22121.56 \u00b1 0.14 (Brandt et al., 2001); more negative values of \u03b1ox indicate\na quasar is X-ray weak relative to its UV power.\n2\nAt z > 1.35 blueshifted C iv absorption, the definitive BAL quasar signature, enters the observed LBQS wavelength range.\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 2. Histogram of the \u03b1ox values from the\nLBQS BAL quasar exploratory survey. The\nsolid line is the entire sample, while the dotted line is the sample of LoBAL quasars. The\narrows indicate upper limits. For comparison, the dashed gray line represents the lowredshift Palomar-Green sample of unabsorbed\nradio-quiet quasars from Brandt et al. (2000).\n\nobjects that are detected, a measurement of the hardness ratio3 indicates what fraction of the full-band (0.5\u2013\n8.0 keV) counts are coming from hard band (2\u20138 keV) X-rays. Absorbed quasar spectra will have larger\nvalues of the hardness ratio as the cross-section for photoelectric absorption in the X-ray band decreases\nrapidly with increasing energy. The trend of increasing hardness ratio with decreasing \u03b1ox illustrated in\nFigure 3 is therefore consistent with the understanding that X-ray faintness arises from intrinsic absorption.\nWhile this result is not new, it supports the idea that \u03b1ox can be used in a rough sense to indicate the extent\nof absorption. Following this premise, \u03b1ox might be expected to correlate with UV absorption properties\nsuch as C iv absorption-line equivalent width, as demonstrated by Brandt et al. (2000) for their sample\nof Palomar-Green quasars. To complement Brandt et al. (2000) we are probing the extreme end of this\nparameter space with the BAL quasars. In this regime, there are no apparent correlations between \u03b1ox and\nseveral absorption-line properties for the BAL quasars , most significantly the minimum velocity of C iv\nabsorption shown in Figure 3.\nFurthermore, the large column densities of absorbing gas implied by values of \u03b1ox <\n\u223c \u2212 2.0 coupled with\nthe blue UV continua of the majority of our sample imply that the X-ray absorbing gas contains little dust,\nat least as we know it. This is consistent with the X-ray absorber being located within the dust sublimation\nradius. Alternatively, the bulk of the X-ray absorption may lie interior to the UV emission region, though\nthis implies even smaller radii for the absorption.\nWe also confirm the result of Green et al. (2001) that the BAL quasars with broad Mg ii absorption, the\nLoBAL quasars, are notably X-ray weaker than those with only high-ionization BALs. In fact, only one of\nthe LoBAL quasars in our sample was actually detected (see Figure 2). Given that LoBAL quasars generally\nhave reddened optical and UV continua, it is unclear whether the extreme X-ray absorption that they suffer\nis occuring on the small scales inferred for the high-ionization BAL quasars. However, X-ray variability of\nthe LoBAL quasar Mrk 231 suggests that a substantial X-ray absorber is located within \u223c 1015 cm of the\nX-ray continuum source (Gallagher et al., 2002c).\nRESULTS FROM X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY\nThough exploratory surveys are essential for determining the general X-ray properties of the population\nas a whole, spectroscopic investigations are also required to obtain more detailed information on the X-ray\ncontinuum shape and absorption properties. Gallagher et al. (2002b) gathered together 8 spectroscopicquality observations to investigate general trends from these data. In general, they found that the underlying\nX-ray continua are consistent with normal radio-quiet quasars, with significant, complex absorption. Possible\nsources of the observed complexity (illustrated in Figure 4) include partial covering of the X-ray continuum,\nionized gas, and velocity structure similar to that seen in the UV regime. Furthermore, normalizing the\npower-law continua above 5 keV to correct for absorption resulted in typical radio-quiet quasar values of\n\u03b1ox . All of these results are consistent with the Murray et al. (1995) picture.\nHowever, some unexpected results have also arisen. Among the most interesting is the observation of\n3\n\nThe hardness ratio is defined as HR = (h \u2212 s)/f where h = 2\u20138 keV counts, s = 0.5\u20132.0 keV counts, and f = 0.5\u20138.0 keV\ncounts.\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 3. Left panel: Hardness ratio versus \u03b1ox . The trend of increasing hardness ratio with decreasing \u03b1ox is\nconsistent with absorption as the primary cause of X-ray weakness in BAL quasars. Right panel: Minimum\nvelocity of C iv absorption versus \u03b1ox . Contrary to expectations from the shielding gas models (\u00a75, Murray et al.,\n1995), there is no apparent correlation between these parameters.\n\nFig. 4. Observed-frame ACIS-S3 spectrum\nof PG 1115+080. This spectrum has been\nfit with a power-law model above rest-frame\n5 keV which has then been extrapolated back\nto lower energies. The significant negative\nresiduals below \u223c 1.2 keV indicate strong absorption, and the structure rules out simple\nabsorption by neutral gas. While the nature of this complex absorber is not wellconstrained, it is consistent with a high ionization parameter.\n\ntwo absorption lines in the spectrum of APM 08279+5255, apparently from highly ionized Fe outflowing\nwith speeds of \u223c 0.2 and \u223c 0.4c (Chartas et al., 2002). In radiatively driven flows, such high terminal\nvelocities occur in gas launched at much smaller radii than the UV BAL wind, which has terminal velocities\nof \u223c 12, 000 km s\u22121 . In addition, when compared with an XMM-Newton observation of this object taken\n\u223c 12 rest-frame days later (Hasinger et al., 2002), there is a clear indication of variability in the absorber\nproperties. APM 08279+5255 is not unique; similar absorption lines have also been seen in PG 1115+080\n(Chartas et al., in prep.). These results are challenging for models in which the X-ray and UV absorption\narise in the same medium and are predicted to have the same velocity structure (e.g., Elvis, 2000). Significant\niron emission has also been observed in some objects including H 1413+117 (Oshima et al., 2001; Gallagher\net al., 2002b).\nIn another unanticipated result, the formerly X-ray brightest BAL quasar PG 2112+059 (Gallagher et al.,\n2001) exhibited significant variability between the ASCA observation of Oct 1999 and the Chandra observation of Sep 2002. In the most recent Chandra data, the power-law continuum normalization dropped by\na factor of a few while the measured column density of the absorber increased significantly. Notably, concurrent HST STIS data of the C iv absorption line showed no large changes from earlier UV observations.\nFor PG 2112+059 at least, evidence for distinct X-ray and UV absorbers is mounting.\n\n\f5\nIMPLICATIONS FOR THEORETICAL MODELS OF QUASAR OUTFLOWS\nIn general, X-ray studies are providing support for the family of radiatively driven wind models. BAL quasars\nare generally X-ray weak with values of \u03b1ox indicating a significant reduction in observed X-ray flux relative\nto the UV continuum. When sufficient data are available, the intrinsic X-ray power, corrected for absorption,\nis typical of normal radio-quiet quasars. The complexity in the X-ray absorbers is consistent with highly\nionized gas as predicted for the shielding gas; however the ionization state cannot be constrained given the\ncurrent data quality.\nThough the wind models have had some success, the lack of any apparent correlation between the UV\nabsorption-line and X-ray properties is contrary to the model predictions. While certainly X-ray and UV\nabsorption are found together in the same objects, the connection between the two is not straightforward.\nThis is perhaps not unexpected given the complexity of the UV BALs and potential quasar-to-quasar\nvariations in wind properties. The assertion of Elvis (2000) that the UV and X-ray absorption arise from\nthe same medium is not easily reconciled with the lack of connection between X-ray and UV variability\nseen in PG 2112+059 and the mismatch in X-ray and UV absorption properties seen in APM 08279+5255.\nIn addition, the large-velocity outflows seen in APM 08279+5255, which imply a much smaller launching\nradius that for the BAL gas, do not fit within the Elvis (2000) picture with a narrow range of launching\nradii for the outflow.\nOne of the problems for theoretical wind models with small launching radii is the lack of variability in\nvelocity structure in the UV absorption lines on observed-frame timescales of years (e.g., de Kool, 1997).\nHowever, the most comprehensive absorption-line variability investigation to date, the 3 yr study of Barlow\n(1993), was not long enough for a conclusive test; the hydrodynamic wind models of Proga et al. (2000)\ngenerated instabilities on rest-frame timescales of \u223c 3 yr. With longer time baselines, velocity increases have\nbeen seen for at least one object (Vilkoviskij and Irwin, 2001), and an extended study is certainly warranted\nto investigate this issue further. If the bulk of the X-ray absorbing gas is on smaller scales than the BAL\ngas, it is also possible that X-ray absorption variability on shorter timescales may regularly occur, as seen\nfor PG 2112+059 and APM 08279+5255. To make accurate predictions for such events, the hydrodynamic\nmodels may need to be extended to smaller radii (< 1015 cm) with higher resolution, and also more explicitly\ninclude the effects of Compton pressure. For highly ionized gas, this will dominate the radiation force (D.\nChelouche, priv. comm.). Additional items for an X-ray observer's wish list from theoretical modeling are\nspecific predictions for the strength and profiles of Fe emission and absorption lines.\nAn outstanding issue for future investigations concerns the velocity of the X-ray absorbing gas in most\nBAL quasars; is it stalled, outflowing, or inflowing? Proga et al. (2000) claimed that highly ionized gas should\nbe inflowing or stalled, but the evidence from APM 08279+5255 and PG 1115+080 suggests otherwise. An\nX-ray gratings observation of a BAL quasar offers the potential for a qualitative advance in this field. The\nimproved resolution of gratings data, from \u2206v \u223c 20, 000 km s\u22121 for CCD data to < 1300 km s\u22121 , would\nenable a more penetrating and subtle investigation into the connection between UV and X-ray absorption.\nIn particular, significant constraints could be placed on the velocity, column density, and ionization state of\nthe X-ray absorbing gas. These values can then provide information on the location of the X-ray absorber\nand the mass-outflow rate, parameters of fundamental physical importance.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Sera Markov, Bev Wills, and Doron Chelouche for helpful discussions.
