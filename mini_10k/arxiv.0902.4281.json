The density and temperature dependence of these correlation functions is analyzed in order\nto describe the structure of the dense fluid helium at extreme conditions.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the interiors of solar and extrasolar1 giant planets, light elements such as hydrogen and helium are exposed\nto extreme temperature (\u223c10000K) and pressure (10 \u2013 1000 GPa) conditions. Shock wave measurements2 are the\npreferred experimental technique to reach such conditions in the laboratory. Lasers3 , magnetic fields4 , and explosives5\nhave recently been used to generate shock waves that reached megabar pressures. The challenge of these experiments\nis first to reach such extreme conditions and secondly to characterize the properties of the material with sufficient\naccuracy so that planetary interior model actually can be improved. Single shock experiments yield the highest\naccuracy to the equation of state (EOS). However those can rarely reach densities much higher than 4 times the\nstarting density, which means a large part of giant planet interiors cannot be probed directly6,7 .\nThe limitation in density has recently been addressed by combining static compression in a diamond anvil cell with\ndynamic shock compression3 . The experiments by Eggert et al. reached pressures of 200 GPa in helium, which is a\nsignificant increase compared to the gas gun experiments by Nellis et al.8 from 1984 that had reached 16 GPa on the\nprincipal Hugoniot.\nThe properties of dense helium have also be the subject of a series of recent theoretical investigations with firstprinciples simulation techniques. In9 , helium was predicted to reach 5.24-fold compression in shock experiments.\nThe compression ratio is larger than 4 because of electronic excitations that occur in the fluid at high temperature.\nKietzmann et al.10 studied the rise in electrical conductivity using the Kubo-Greenwood formula and compared with\nresults of shock-wave experiments by Ternovoi et al.11 . Kowalski et al.12 studied dense helium in order to characterize\nthe atmosphere of white dwarfs. The paper went beyond the generalized gradient approximation by considering\nhybrid functionals. Stixrude and Jeanloz13 studied the band gap closure in the dense fluid helium over a wide range of\ndensities including conditions of giant planet interiors. Two recent studies of Jupiter's interior14,15 , to very different\nextent, relied on a helium EOS derived the DFT-MD.\nThe insulator-to-metal transition in solid helium at high pressure was the subject of a recent quantum Monte Carlo\nstudy16 that showed that standard density functional methods underestimate the band gap by 4 eV, which means the\nmetallization pressure is underestimated by 40%.\nIn this article, path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) and density functional molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations\nare combined to study pair correlation functions in fluid helium over a large density and temperature interval. This\npaper expands upon an earlier work17 that demonstrated that DFT-MD results at lower temperatures and PIMC\ndata at higher temperatures can be combined into one coherent EOS table. Ref.17 also provide a free energy fit,\ncomputed adiabats and the electronic density of states. The EOS was compared with different semi-analytical free\nenergy models18,19,20 .\nII.\n\nMETHODS\n\nPath integral Monte Carlo21 is the most appropriate and efficient first-principles simulation techniques for quantum\nsystem with thermal excitations. Electrons and nuclei are treated equally as paths, although the zero-point motion of\nthe nuclei as well as exchange effects are negligible for the temperatures under consideration. The Coulomb interaction\nbetween electrons and nuclei is introduced using pair density matrices that we derived using the eigenstates of the\ntwo-body Coulomb problem22 . The periodic images were treated using an optimized Ewald break-up23 that we applied\nto the pair action24 . The explicit treatment of electrons as paths leads to the fermion sign problem, which requires\none to introduce the only uncontrolled approximation in this method, the fixed node approximation25,26 . We use the\nnodes from the free-particle density matrix and from a variational density matrix27 .

The vertical lines show isochores for the following rs parameters: 2.4, 2.2, 2.0, 1.86, 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, and\n1.0.\n\ncorrelation effects are included in PIMC, which for example leads an exact treatment of the isolated helium atom.\nWe performed PIMC simulations with 32 and 57 atoms. Additional details are given in reference17 .\nThe DFT-MD simulations were performed with either the CPMD code28 using local Troullier-Martins normconserving pseudopotentials29 or with the Vienna ab initio simulation package30 using the projector augmented-wave\nmethod31 . The nuclei were propagated using Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics with forces derived from either\nthe electronic ground state or by including thermally excited electronic states when needed. Exchange-correlation\neffects were described by the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation32. The electronic wavefunctions were expanded in a plane-wave basis with energy cut-off of 30-50 Hartrees. Most simulations were performed\nwith N =64 using \u0393 point sampling of the Brillioun zone.\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nFigure 1 shows the pressure-temperature-density conditions where PIMC and DFT-MD simulations have been\npreformed. The density will be discussed in terms of the Wigner-Seitz radius, rs , that is defined by V /Ne = 43 \u03c0(rs a0 )3 .\nThere is a substantial difference in the slopes of the isochores in figure 1. At low temperature and high density, the\nisochores are nearly vertical because the dominant contribution to the pressure is provided by degenerate electrons.\nIt takes a significant increase in temperature before thermal excitations of the electrons add in a noticible way to the\npressure and for isochores to bend over to high pressures. At lower densities, the biggest contribution comes from the\nionic motion, and one finds the typical pressure-temperature relation of a dense, but not degenerate fluid.\nFigure 2 shows the nuclear pair correlation function, g(r), derived from DFT-MD simulations,\n*\n+\nX\nV\n\u03b4(r \u2212 (ri \u2212 rj ))\n(1)\ng(r) =\nN (N \u2212 1)\ni6=j\n*\n+\nX\nV\n\u03b4(r \u2212 |ri \u2212 rj |) ,\n(2)\ng(r) =\n4\u03c0r2 N (N \u2212 1)\ni6=j\n\nThe sum includes all pairs of N particles in volume V = L3 .

For the right figure, only results for rs =1.0, 1.25, 1.5, and 2.2 are shown for\nclarity.\n\nFigure 2 shows a gradual decrease in the g(r) oscillations with decreasing density. Such oscillations are the typical\nsignature of the structure liquid or a solid. At high density, the g(r) functions of both phases are more structured\nbecause the motion of the particles is more confined. The g(r) functions are often fairly insensitive to the melting\ntransition. The structure factor S(k) and the diffusion constant are more reliable measures to identify melting in\na simulation. However, that does not address the problem of superheating and supercooling that occurs in many\nsimulations and also in nature. For an accurate determination of the melting temperature one needs to perform free\nenergy calculations or perfrom simulations with liquid and solid in coexistence.\nFigure 3 compares the nuclear pair correlation functions at two temperature of 10 000 and 60 000 K. The increase in\ntemperature leads to stronger collisions, which means the onset of the g(r) is shifted to lower distances compared to\n1000 K. The motion of particles is less confined and, consequently, the peak height in the g(r) is reduced substationally.\nAt 60 000 K, the g(r) shows only a small peak at the highest density, which then disappears altogether with decreasing\ndensity.\n\n\f4\n1.2\n\n1.2\n6\n\nT=125000K\n\nT=10 K\n\n1\n\n1\n\nrS=1.0\nrS=2.4\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nrS=1\n\n0.8\n\ngn\u2212n(r) [aB]\n\ngn\u2212n(r) [aB]\n\n0.8\n\nrS=2.4\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nr [aB]\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n6\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\nr [aB]\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 4: Nuclear pair correlation functions computed with PIMC are shown for 125 000 (left) and 106 K (right) are shown for\nthe following rs values: 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, and 2.4.\n2\n6\n\nT=125000K\n\nT=10 K\nne*gn\u2212e(r) [aB]\n\nne*gn\u2212e(r) [aB]\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\nr [aB]\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\nr [aB]\n\n2\n\nFIG. 5: Electron-nucleus pair correlation functions, gn\u2212e (r), are shown for 125 000 (left) and 106 K (right) for the following rs\nvalues: 1.0 (top line), 1.25, 1.5, 1.75 (only for 106 K) 2.0, and 2.4 (lowest line). The gn\u2212e (r) function has been multilied by the\nvolume density of electrons so that the area under the curves is related to the fraction of bound electrons.\n\nFigure 4 shows the nuclear pair correlation function derived with PIMC for 125 000 and 106 K. The expected trend\ncontinues; with increasing temperature and decreasing density the fluid becomes less structured. At an extreme\ntemperature of 106 K, one can hardly find any positive correlation in the motion of the nuclei for the whole density\nrange under consideration.\nFigure 5 shows the correlation functions between nuclei and electrons. The gn\u2212e (r) functions were multiplied by the\nelectronic density, Ne /V , so that integral under the curve is related the number of electrons within a certain distance\nfrom a nucleus. This provides a qualitative estimate for the fraction of bound electrons. A quantititive estimate is\ndifficult to give because unbound electrons in Rydberg scattering states also make contributions to gn\u2212e (r) at small\nr. Furthermore, there is no straightforward way to tell to which nucleus a particular electron is bound. The long tail\nin the gn\u2212e (r) includes unbound electrons as well as contribution from electrons bound to other nuclei nearby. In\nprinciple, the fraction of bound electrons can be determined from the natural orbitals of the reduced single particle\ndensity matrix33 , but no practical method that is compatible with many-body simulations has been advanced. At\nvery low density, however, approaches that fit g(r) have worked reasonably well34 .\nAt 125 000 K, the electron-nucleus pair correlation functions in figure 5 show a relatively weak dependence on density.\nThe presence of the peak at small r suggests that a fraction of the electrons are still bound at this temperature. At\n106 K, the density dependence of the gn\u2212e (r) is much stronger.

The dashed lines on the right repeat correlation functions\nfor electrons with opposite spins from figure 6 for rs = 1.0 and 2.4.\n\nin the motion of electrons and nuclei, which indicates the nuclei are almost fully ionized and most electrons are free.\nAt higher densities, the motion of the electrons is more confined, which leads to an increased positive correlation with\nthe nuclei.\nThe pair correlation function of the electrons with opposite spin in figure 6 shows a qualitatively different behavior\nat low and high temperature. Since they have different spins, the Pauli exclusion principle does not apply and only\nCoulomb repulsion keeps these pairs of particles apart. However, at 125 000 K, one observe a significant positive\ncorrelation, because two electrons with opposite spins are bound in a helium atom. So the peak in this ge\u2212e (r)\nconfirms the existance of bound electrons. The peak height decreases significantly with increasing density, which\nsuggests that degeneracy in the electron gas increases and the number of bound states decreases accordingly. The\nslope of the isochores in figure 1 underlines the importance of the degeneracy at 125 000 K.\nAt 106 K the behavior of the pair correlation function of the electrons with opposite spin is very different. The\nelectrons are mostly unbound and are not degenerate. Coulomb repulsion leads to a negative correlation that much\nweaker than the Pauli exclusion for electron with parallel spin to be discussed next. With increasing density, the\nCoulomb repulsion has less of an effect, which means the value of g(r = 0) increases.\nFigure 7 shows the pair correlation function of the electrons with parallel spins. The negative correlation at small\nr is known as exchange-correlation hole. The effect of the Pauli exclusion is short-ranged, which can be understood\n\n\f6\nfrom the graph at 106 K. At approximately r = 1.3 a0 , the correlation functions of electrons with parallel and opposite\nspin converge, which marks the point where Pauli exclusion is no longer relevant.\nThe density dependence of the g(r) of electrons with parallel spins at 125 000 K is more difficult to interpret because\nof the presence of bound states. At rs = 1, one finds a small positive correlation, which can only be explained with\na positive correlation in the nuclei g(r) (figure 4) and the presence of bound electrons. Furthermore, one expects the\nsize of the exchange-correlation hole would increase with decreasing density, which explains the difference between\nrs = 1 and 1.75. However, if the density is decreased further the size of the exchange-correlation hole shrinks slightly.\nSince there are more bound electrons present at rs = 2.4, the collision of the nuclei brings the electron closer together\nthan they would be otherwise, which explains observed behavior.\nIn conclusion, the structure of a very simple fluid, helium, has been discussed at extreme pressure and density\nconditions. The observed trends are general and have relevance to other light elements are conditions of planetary\ninteriors.\nAcknowledgments\n\nA part of the reported first-principles simulations were performed at NERSC and at NCSA.\nReferences\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n\n31\n32\n33\n34\n\nA.
