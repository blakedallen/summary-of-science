It is shown to restrict to the full subcategory Gray-Gpd\nof Gray-groupoids. This is used to provide a functorial and model-theoretic proof of the unpublished\ntheorem of Joyal and Tierney that Gray-groupoids model homotopy 3-types. The model structure\non Gray-Cat is conjectured to be Quillen equivalent to a model structure on the category Tricat of\ntricategories and strict homomorphisms of tricategories.\n\nMuch of the recent development of higher category theory has been inspired and guided by the idea that\nhigher groupoids should classify homotopy types. This is sometimes called the \"homotopy hypothesis\". A\nhigher groupoid is a higher category in which morphisms at all dimensions are invertible in a suitable sense;\nhere, that will mean that they are strictly invertible, so that the composite of a morphism with its inverse\nis literally equal to an identity morphism. The goal of this paper is to describe certain precise relationships\nbetween higher categories and homotopy types, in low dimensions, using the machinery of model categories\nand Quillen equivalences.\nExperience so far suggests that for each dimension n there should be a model category which captures\nwhat it is to \"do\" n-dimensional category theory, and that this should restrict to a model category on\nn-dimensional groupoids which provide a model for homotopy n-types.\nThe case n = 1 is well-understood. The category Cat of (small) categories and functors has a model\nstructure [10] for which the weak equivalences are the equivalences of categories, and the fibrations are\nthe functors with the isomorphism-lifting property. (The word fibration will always be used in the modelcategorical sense; we shall not need to discuss categorical fibrations.) This model structure on Cat is\nsometimes given the epithet \"folklore\", but I prefer to call it the categorical model structure, since it corresponds to what it is to do category theory. In category theory one regards two categories as being the\nsame when they are equivalent (and then uses the equivalence to identify them). Furthermore the fibrations\nfor the model structure arise naturally as the morphisms with the property that pulling back along them\nsends equivalences to equivalences; there is also an analogous characterizations of the cofibrations [9]. This\nmodel structure on Cat restricts to the full subcategory Gpd of Cat consisting of the groupoids. The\nnerve functor N : Gpd \u2192 SSet is the right adjoint part of a Quillen functor, and this allows us to regard groupoids as models for homotopy 1-types; this is made more precise in Section 6, where we see that\nN : Gpd \u2192 SSet is actually a Quillen equivalence when we replace the usual model structure on SSet with\na localized version, which kills all homotopy information in dimension greater than 1. Thus groupoids are\nseen as the \"intersection of category theory and homotopy theory\". 1\n\u2217 The\n\nsupport of the Australian Research Council and DETYA is gratefully acknowledged.\nshall not have cause to consider the other well-known model structure on Cat, due to Thomason [19] - this is in fact\nQuillen equivalent to that of SSet, and so using this would give a rather different \"intersection\". But while this Thomason\n1 We\n\n1\n\n\fSimilarly, when we turn to the case n = 2, the category 2-Cat of (strict) 2-categories and (strict)\n2-functors has a model structure [12, 13], for which the weak equivalences are the biequivalences, and the\nfibrations are 2-functors allowing liftings of both 1-cells which are equivalences and 2-cells which are invertible.\nOnce again, these biequivalences capture exactly the usual notion of \"sameness\" for 2-categories, and the\nfibrations can be characterized in terms of pulling back of biequivalences. The model structure restricts to\nthe full subcategory 2-Gpd of 2-Cat consisting of the 2-groupoids: these are the 2-categories in which all\n1-cells and 2-cells are (strictly) invertible. The resulting model structure on 2-Gpd was introduced in [17],\nprior to [12]. Once again there is a nerve functor N : 2-Gpd \u2192 SSet which is the right adjoint part of a\nQuillen functor, and is in fact a Quillen equivalence for a localized model structure on SSet, obtained by\nkilling homotopy information in dimension greater than 2; once again, this last aspect is described in more\ndetail in Section 6.\nThe category 2-Cat uses strict notions both for objects (2-categories) and morphisms (2-functors). One\nmight question whether this is really suitable, given that in practice many 2-dimensional structures are\nnot strict. The reason for using 2-functors is that they are much better behaved than the more general\npseudofunctors, and that the more general ones are in any case encoded via the model structure. This is\nthe typical situation: use well-behaved gadgets as models, then use the model structure to get at the more\ngeneral notions. As far as the objects go, the standard notion of weak 2-category is called a bicategory, and\nthe category Bicat of bicategories and strict homomorphisms of these also has a model structure [13], which\nis Quillen equivalent to that on 2-Cat. This fact includes the result [15] that every bicategory is biequivalent\nto a strict one.\nWhen we come to the case n = 3, the general notion of weak 3-category is called a tricategory, and this\ntime it is not the case that every tricategory is suitably equivalent (\"triequivalent\") to a strict one, however\nevery tricategory is triequivalent to an intermediate structure called a Gray-category [4]. One of the main\nresults proved below is that there is a model structure on the category Gray-Cat of Gray-categories for which\nthe weak equivalences are the triequivalences. A Gray-groupoid is a Gray-category in which all 1-cells, 2-cells,\nand 3-cells have strict inverses. We shall also see that the model structure on Gray-Cat restricts to give one\non the full subcategory Gray-Gpd of Gray-groupoids. There is a nerve functor N : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet,\ndefined in [1], which turns out to be the right adjoint part of a Quillen adjunction, and as in the previous\ncases this becomes a Quillen equivalence when we localize SSet by killing homotopies; this time those in\ndimension greater than 3.\nThis provides a model-theoretic and functorial formulation of the unpublished but widely advertised result\nof Joyal and Tierney that Gray-groupoids model homotopy 3-types. The possibility of such a formulation was\nsuggested by Berger in [1]. In [1, Theorem 3.3], Berger considered the nerve functor N : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet\nand its left adjoint \u03a03 , and asserted that the model structure on SSet could be transported across this\nadjunction to give a model structure on Gray-Gpd, and then show that the adjunction would induce an\nequivalence at the homotopy level between Gray-groupoids and simplicial 3-types. He did not, however, give\na proof that the model structure actually transports. Once one knows that the structure transports, the fact\nthat there is a Quillen adjunction is immediate, while the fact that is a Quillen equivalence, and so induces\nan equivalence of homotopy categories, essentially amounts to [1, Proposition 3.2].\nI take a different approach, constructing the model structure on Gray-Gpd from that on Gray-Cat,\nrather than transporting it from SSet. The existence of the model structure is then more or less immediate,\nbut one must show that the nerve is part of a Quillen adjunction - this contrasts with the approach of\n[1], where the work to be done is in constructing the model structure itself. The arguments given here to\nshow that the nerve is part of a Quillen adjunction can in fact be used to complete the proof in [1] of the\nexistence of the model structure. In either approach one then must do some work (essentially the same) to\nget a Quillen equivalence: the key step is [1, Proposition 3.2].\nIt turns out, after the fact, that the two model structures on Gray-Gpd actually agree: see Corollary 5.5.\nUnlike the case n = 2, we do not yet have a model structure on the category of tricategories, but there is\nevery reason believe that such a structure exists, and that it will be Quillen equivalent to our model structure\nmodel structure is important in homotopy theory, it seems to correspond to another use of categories than category theory\nitself.\n\n2\n\n\fon Gray-Cat: we describe what is known in Section 7.\nWe now give a brief outline of the paper. Section 1 recalls some background material on enriched\ncategories, on model categories, on 2-categories, and on Gray-categories. Section 2 describes the model\nstructure, while Section 3 gives an alternative characterization of the fibrations, and Section 4 proves the\nremaining model category axioms. In Section 5, we look at the restricted model structure for Gray-groupoids,\nand its behaviour with respect to the nerve functor for Gray-groupoids. Section 6 shows how this relationship\ncan be described using Bousfield localizations of the model category of simplicial sets. Section 7 describes\nbriefly what is known about tricategories, and conjectures what else might be true. The last two sections\nconcern the cofibrations for the model structure on Gray-Cat and in particular the cofibrant objects:\nSection 8 contains some preliminary material on computads, and Section 9 a characterization of cofibrations\nof Gray-categories and of cofibrant Gray-categories.\nI first proved the existence of the model structure on Gray-Cat in January 2007. Since then, the paper\nhas evolved in various ways, thanks in part to helpful conversations with a number of people. I received\nmany helpful suggestions from Clemens Berger; among other things, when I explained to Clemens the model\nstructure, he suggested that it might be possible to characterize the fibrations in the way given below, in\nterms of P\u2217 and \u03c0\u2217 . John Harper suggested the particular form that the localizations in Section 6 might\ntake. I am grateful to both of them, and also to Michael Batanin and Richard Garner, for enlightening\ndiscussions on other aspects of the paper.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nBackground\nEnriched categories\n\nFor a monoidal category V = (V , \u2297, I), we write V -Cat for the category of V -categories and V -functors;\nthis can be made into a 2-category with the V -natural transformations as 2-cells, but we shall not need to\ndo so. The most important case will be where V is the category 2-Cat of 2-categories and 2-functors, and\n\u2297 is what is called the Gray tensor product; then the V -categories are precisely the Gray-categories of the\nintroduction. When V is the cartesian closed category Cat, a V -category is a 2-category. If A and B are\nobjects of a V -category A , we write A (A, B) for the corresponding hom-object in V .\nFor monoidal categories V = (V , \u2297, I) and W = (W , \u2297, I) , a monoidal functor P : V \u2192 W consists\nof a functor P between the underlying categories, equipped with natural coherent morphisms P X \u2297 P Y \u2192\nP (X \u2297 Y ) and I \u2192 P I. Such a monoidal functor induces a 2-functor P\u2217 : V -Cat \u2192 W -Cat sending\na V -category A to the W -category P\u2217 A with the same objects as A , but with W -valued homs given\nby (P\u2217 A )(A, B) = P (A (A, B)). In particular, for any monoidal category V the representable functor\nV (I, \u2212) : V \u2192 Set arising from the unit I is monoidal, and so induces a 2-functor V -Cat \u2192 Cat sending\na V -category A to its underlying ordinary category A0 .\nIf V is a monoidal category, a V -category A is said to have a property \"locally\" if each hom-object\nA (A, B) has the property (as an object of V ). Similarly a V -functor F : A \u2192 B has a property if each\nF : A (A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) has the property (as a morphism of V ). So for example, one might call a\nV -functor F : A \u2192 B \"locally an isomorphism\" if each F : A (A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) is an isomorphism in\nV ; more commonly, however, such an F is called fully faithful.\nA V -functor F : A \u2192 B is an equivalence if there exists a V -functor G : B \u2192 A with GF \u223c\n= 1 and\nFG \u223c\n= 1. This is the case if and only if F is fully faithful (in the sense of the previous paragraph) and\nessentially surjective on objects (for each B \u2208 B there is an A \u2208 A with B \u223c\n= F A in B). Note that an\nisomorphism B \u223c\n= F A in B is the same thing as an isomorphism in the underlying ordinary category B0 of\nB.\n\n1.2\n\nMonoidal model categories\n\nA monoidal model category [8] is a category that has both a symmetric monoidal closed structure and a\nmodel structure, satisfying some compatibility conditions: the \"pushout product\" axiom should hold, as\n\n3\n\n\fshould a condition on the tensor unit; the latter condition is automatic if, as in our examples, the unit is\ncofibrant.\nAll that is really needed in this paper is that if V is a monoidal model category, then the homotopy\ncategory hoV of V inherits a derived monoidal structure for which the canonical functor P : V \u2192 hoV\nis strong monoidal. We shall also write \u03c0 : V \u2192 Set for the composite of P with the monoidal functor\nhoV (I, \u2212) : hoV \u2192 Set given by homming out of the unit. This also induces a functor \u03c0\u2217 : V -Cat \u2192 Cat.\n\n1.3\n\n2-categories\n\nIn this section we recall a few basic ideas about 2-categories. Adjunctions can be defined in any 2-category,\nwith the usual notion of adjunction being the case of the 2-category Cat. An adjunction in a 2-category\nK consists of morphisms f : A \u2192 B and g : B \u2192 A with 2-cells \u03b7 : 1 \u2192 gf and \u01eb : gf \u2192 1 satisfying the\ntriangle equations.\nSuch an adjunction is called an adjoint equivalence when the unit \u03b7 and counit \u01eb are both invertible.\nOccasionally I may allow myself to say that a morphism f \"is an adjoint equivalence\"; this always means\nthat some definite choice of g, \u03b7, and \u01eb has been made.\nOn the other hand, a morphism f is an equivalence when there exists a morphism g with gf \u223c\n= 1 and\n\u223c\nf g = 1. As is well-known (see [12] for example), if f is an equivalence and \u03b7 : 1 \u223c\n= gf is an isomorphism,\nthen there is exactly one choice of \u01eb for which the one (either) triangle equation holds; then the other will\nalso hold, and we shall have an adjoint equivalence. (Similarly given \u01eb there is exactly one way to choose \u03b7.)\nThe category 2-Cat is locally finitely presentable, by [11], and so small object arguments work smoothly.\nWe shall consider 2-Cat with the model structure of [12]. The corresponding homotopy category has\n2-categories as objects, and pseudonatural equivalence classes of pseudofunctors as morphisms. A weak\nequivalence in 2-Cat is (a 2-functor which is) a biequivalence F : A \u2192 B: this means that F is locally\nan equivalence, so that each F : A (A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) is an equivalence; and furthermore that F is\nbiessentially surjective, so that each object X \u2208 B is equivalent to one of the form F A for some A \u2208 A .\n\n1.4\n\nGray-categories\n\nWe shall primarily be interested in the case where V is the category 2-Cat, equipped with the model\nstructure of [12] and the symmetric monoidal closed structure given by the Gray tensor product [5]; this\nmonoidal category is often called Gray, to distinguish it from the monoidal category with the cartesian\nproduct as tensor product.\nA 3-category is a category enriched in 2-Cat with the cartesian product; a Gray-category is a category\nenriched in 2-Cat with the Gray tensor product. The difference between Gray-categories and 3-categories\nis that while given 2-cells\ng\n\nf\n\nA\n\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f &\n\u0013\u03b18B\n\nf\u2032\n\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f\n\u0013\n\ng\u2032\n\n\u03b2\n\n&\n8C\n\nin a 3-category, the composites \u03b2f \u2032 .g\u03b1 and g \u2032 \u03b1.\u03b2f agree, in a Gray-category they need not; rather, there\nis a specified isomorphism which we call simply \u03b2\u03b1 or \u03b2\u03b1 . These are sometimes called the pseudonaturality\nisomorphisms.\nA morphism f : A \u2192 B in a Gray-category A is called a biequivalence in A if there is a morphism\ng : B \u2192 A with gf \u2243 1 and f g \u2243 1. For any Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B we have F g.F f = F (gf ) \u2243 F 1 = 1\nand F f.F g \u2243 1, and so F f is also a biequivalence.\nThen hoGray is the category of 2-categories and equivalence classes of pseudofunctors, while \u03c0 : Gray \u2192\nSet sends a 2-category A to the set of equivalence classes of objects of A (in other words objects A and\nB are equivalent exactly when they are equivalent in the 2-category A ). We shall write Gray-Cat for\nthe category of Gray-categories and Gray-functors (the 2-cells will have little explicit role). The category\n2-Cat is locally finitely presentable, thus so by [11] is Gray-Cat. This means that small object arguments\nwork smoothly in Gray-Cat (all objects are small).\n\n4\n\n\fWe shall frequently use the functors P\u2217 : Gray-Cat \u2192 ho Gray-Cat and \u03c0\u2217 : Gray-Cat \u2192 Cat.\n\n2\n\nThe model structure on Gray-Cat\n\nWe define a Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B to be a weak equivalence if it induces an equivalence P\u2217 F : P\u2217 A \u2192 P\u2217 B\nof hoGray-categories. We shall spell out more explicitly what this means in the following paragraphs, but\nit is immediate from this definition that these weak equivalences are closed under retracts and satisfy the\n2-out-of-3 property, since equivalences of enriched categories have these closure properties.\nTo say that P\u2217 F is an equivalence is to say that it is fully faithful and essentially surjective on objects.\nBeing fully faithful means that each P\u2217 F : P\u2217 A(A, B) \u2192 P\u2217 B(F A, F B) is invertible in hoGray; in other\nwords, each P F : P (A(A, B)) \u2192 P (B(F A, F B)) is invertible in hoGray; but this is just to say that each\nF : A(A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) is a weak equivalence in Gray; in other words, a biequivalence.\nOn the other hand P\u2217 F is essentially surjective when for every B \u2208 B there is an A \u2208 A with an\nisomorphism B \u223c\n= F A in P\u2217 B. But isomorphisms in P\u2217 B are just isomorphisms in the underlying ordinary\ncategory \u03c0\u2217 B of P\u2217 B, so this is just saying that \u03c0\u2217 F : \u03c0\u2217 A \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 B is essentially surjective on objects.\nWe can also make this still more explicit. The category \u03c0\u2217 B has the same objects as B, but a morphism\nin \u03c0\u2217 B from B to C is an equivalence class of pseudofunctors 1 \u2192 B(B, C). So such a morphism can be\nrepresented by a morphism f : B \u2192 C in B, but two such f, g : B \u2192 C represent the same morphism in\n(ho\u2217 B)0 if and only if they are equivalent. So objects B and C of ho\u2217 B are isomorphic if and only if there\nexist f : B \u2192 C and g : C \u2192 B with equivalences gf \u2243 1 and f g \u2243 1; that is, if and only if they are\nbiequivalent in B. And this means that the weak equivalences in Gray-Cat are precisely the triequivalences\nof Gray-categories.\nWe define a Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B to be a fibration if it induces fibrations F : A(A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B)\nin V between the hom-objects, for all A, B \u2208 A, and if moreover the functor \u03c0\u2217 F : \u03c0\u2217 A \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 B is a fibration\nin Cat (an isofibration). This means that for every object A \u2208 A and every isomorphism f : B \u223c\n= F A in\n\u03c0\u2217 B, there is an object A\u2032 \u2208 A with F A\u2032 = B and an isomorphism f \u2032 : A\u2032 \u223c\n= A in \u03c0\u2217 A with F f \u2032 = f (in\n\u03c0\u2217 B).\nOf course a Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B is a trivial fibration if it is weak equivalence and a fibration;\nthis means that each F : A(A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) is a weak equivalence and a fibration - that is, a trivial\nfibration in 2-Cat, and that each \u03c0\u2217 F : \u03c0\u2217 A \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 B is essentially surjective on objects and an isofibration.\nThis certainly implies that \u03c0\u2217 F is surjective on objects; but \u03c0\u2217 does not affect the objects, and so F itself\nis surjective on objects. We can now prove:\nProposition 2.1 A Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B is a trivial fibration if and only if it is surjective on objects\nand is locally a trivial fibration in 2-Cat.\nProof: We have already seen the \"only if\" part. For the converse, suppose that F is surjective on objects\nand a trivial fibration on the homs. Then certainly it is a weak equivalence, and is a fibration on the homs.\nIt remains to show that \u03c0\u2217 F is an isofibration. But since F is a weak equivalence on the homs, \u03c0\u2217 F is\nfully faithful; since it is also surjective on objects, it is a trivial fibration in Cat, and so in particular an\nisofibration.\n\u0003\nWe define the cofibrations to be the Gray-functors with the left lifting property with respect to the\ntrivial fibrations. For a 2-category X we define 2X to be the Gray-category with two objects 0 and 1,\nwith 2X (0, 0) = 2X (1, 1) = 1, 2X (0, 1) = X, and 2X (1, 0) = 0. This is clearly functorial in X, and for any\nGray-category A, there is a bijection between Gray-functors 2X \u2192 A and pairs of objects A, B \u2192 A along\nwith a 2-functor X \u2192 A(A, B). We may now take as generating cofibrations the 2j : 2X \u2192 2Y for each\ngenerating cofibration j : X \u2192 Y in 2-Cat, and the unique Gray-functor 0 \u2192 1; and the cofibrations and\ntrivial fibrations from a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system with respect to these generating\ncofibrations.\nWe shall prove the following theorem:\n\n5\n\n\fTheorem 2.2 This choice of cofibrations, fibrations, and weak equivalences makes Gray-Cat into a (combinatorial) model category.\nThe key step is to show that fibrations can be defined via a right lifting property. We shall do this in the\nnext section. Given that, the remainder of the proof is largely formal.\nRemark 2.3 For any monoidal model category V we could define a V -functor F : A \u2192 B to be a weak\nequivalence if P\u2217 F : P\u2217 A \u2192 P\u2217 B is an equivalence of hoV -categories, and to be a fibration if F it is locally a\nfibration in V and \u03c0\u2217 F : \u03c0\u2217 A \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 B is a fibration in Cat. Then the trivial fibrations would be precisely the\nV -functors which are surjective on objects and locally a trivial fibration in V , and the cofibrations could be\ndefined to be the morphisms with the left lifting property with respect to the trivial fibrations. In order to\nprove the model category axioms, however, we shall use various properties of the monoidal model category\nV = Gray.\n\n3\n\nFibrations of Gray-categories and adjoint biequivalences in Graycategories\n\nRecall that a Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B is a fibration if it satisfies the following two conditions:\n(i) The 2-functor F : A(A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) is a fibration in 2-Cat for all objects A, B \u2208 A\n(ii) For each A \u2208 A and each isomorphism f : B \u223c\n= F A in \u03c0\u2217 B, there is an A\u2032 \u2208 A with F A\u2032 = B and an\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u223c\nisomorphism f : A = A in \u03c0\u2217 A with F f = f .\nThe first condition clearly amounts to the fact that F has the right lifting property with respect to the\nGray-functors 2j : 2X \u2192 2Y for each generating trivial cofibration j : X \u2192 Y of 2-Cat. The second\ncondition is not, as it stands, a right lifting property of F , since it involves \u03c0\u2217 A and \u03c0\u2217 B. We shall show how\nto replace condition (ii) with a condition (ii*) which is a right lifting property, and which, in the presence of\n(i), is equivalent to (ii).\nRecall that a morphism f : A \u2192 B in a Gray-category B is a biequivalence if there exist a g : B \u2192 A\nwith 1 \u2243 gf and f g \u2243 1. We define, following [20], an adjoint biequivalence in B to consist of f : A \u2192 B and\ng : B \u2192 A, equipped with adjoint equivalences \u03b7 : 1 \u2243 gf and \u01eb : f g \u2243 1, and isomorphisms S : \u01ebf.f \u03b7 \u223c\n=1\nand T : 1 \u223c\n= g\u01eb.\u03b7g for which the pasting composites\n1\n? gf DD \u0004\nDD ~\u0006 \u0004\u0004T\u0004f\n\u03b7\nDD\n\u03b7gf DD\n\"\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f\n\u03b7\u03b7\ngf\ngf\n1>\n\u0013\n<\n>>\nz\ngf \u03b7 zz\n>>\nz\n>\n\u03b7 >>\nzz ::::gS\n\u0019!\n\u001f\nzz\n1\ngf\n\n/ fg\n>>\nz<\nz\n>> \u01eb\nz\nz\n>>\nzf g\u01eb\n::::f T\nz\n>>\nz\n!\n\u0019\nz\n\u001f\n\u001f\n\u001f\nf \u03b7g\n\u001f \u001f \u01eb\u01eb\n/ f gf g\n\u0013\n?1\nD\nDD \u01ebf g\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n\u0004\n~\u0006 Sg\nDD\nDD\n\u01eb\nD\"\n1\n/ fg\n1\n\ng\u01ebf\n\n/ gf\n>\n\nfg\n\nare identities. One might call these last conditions the tetrahedron equations. Clearly f and g are then\nbiequivalences. Note that we have simply said that \u03b7 : 1 \u2243 gf and \u01eb : f g \u2243 1 are adjoint equivalences,\nbut that this must be understood to mean that we have chosen all the remaining structure of an adjoint\nequivalence (e.g. a morphism \u03b7 \u2217 : gf \u2192 1 and invertible 2-cells \u03b7 \u2217 \u03b7 \u223c\n= 1 satisfying the triangle\n= 1 and \u03b7\u03b7 \u2217 \u223c\nequations).\nWe shall show that every biequivalence can be made into an adjoint biequivalence. More precisely:\nProposition 3.1 Let f : A \u2192 B be a biequivalence.\n\n6\n\n\f(i) If g : B \u2192 A, and \u01eb : f g \u2243 1 is an equivalence, then there exists an equivalence \u03b7 : 1 \u2243 gf and an\nisomorphism S : \u01ebf.f \u03b7 \u223c\n= 1.\n(ii) If g : B \u2192 A, if \u03b7 : 1 \u2243 gf and \u01eb : f g \u2243 1 are equivalences, and if S : \u01ebf.f \u03b7 \u223c\n= 1 is an isomorphism,\nthen there exists a unique isomorphism T : g\u01eb.\u03b7g \u223c\n= 1 satisfying the first tetrahedron equation.\n(iii) If g : B \u2192 A, if \u03b7 : 1 \u2243 gf and \u01eb : f g \u2243 1 are equivalences, if S : \u01ebf.f \u03b7 \u223c\n= 1 are\n= 1 and T : g\u01eb.\u03b7g \u223c\nisomorphisms, and if the first tetrahedron equation holds then so does the second.\nProof: (i) The 2-functor A(A, f ) : A(A, A) \u2192 A(A, B) is a biequivalence, and so locally an equivalence; in\nparticular the induced functor\nA(A, A)(1, gf )\n\nA(A,f )\n\n/ A(A, B)(f, f gf )\n\nis an equivalence and so\nA(A, A)(1, gf )\n\n/ A(A, B)(f, f gf )A(f,\u01ebf ) / A(A, B)(f, f )\n\nA(A,f )\n\nis an equivalence, since \u01eb is one. So by essential surjectivity, there is an \u03b7 : 1 \u2192 gf whose image \u01ebf.f \u03b7 is\nisomorphic to the identity on f , say by S : \u01ebf.f \u03b7 \u223c\n= 1. It remains to check that \u03b7 is an equivalence. Now\n\u01eb is an equivalence, so \u01ebf is an equivalence, so f \u03b7 is an equivalence; but f is a biequivalence, and thus \u03b7 is\nindeed an equivalence.\n(ii) The 2-functor A(B, f ) : A(B, A) \u2192 A(B, B) is a biequivalence, and so locally an equivalence; in\nparticular the induced functor\nA(B, A)(g, g)\n\nA(B,f )\n\n/ A(B, B)(f g, f g)\n\nis an equivalence and so\nA(B, A)(g, g)\n\nA(B,f )\n\n/ A(B, B)(f g, 1)\n/ A(B, B)(f g, f g)A(B,B)(f g,\u01eb)\n\n(1)\n\nis an equivalence.

Similarly, given (g , \u01eb ) in place of (g, \u01eb), there is a suitable equivalence g \u2243 g . In\nsummary, the \"space of ways of making f into an adjoint biequivalence\" is contractible. We shall not need\nthis fact, and so do not bother to formulate it precisely.\nWe are almost ready to give our condition (ii*). First we record the following easy result:\nLemma 3.3 Let P : E \u2192 B be a fibration in 2-Cat, and f : D \u2192 E an equivalence in E . If \u03b2 : g \u223c\n= Pf\nis an invertible 2-cell, and g is part of an adjoint equivalence (g : P D \u2192 P E, g \u2217 : P E \u2192 P D, \u03b7 : 1 \u223c\n=\ng \u2217 g, \u01eb : gg \u2217 \u223c\n= 1), then for any invertible lifting \u03b2 : g \u223c\n= f of \u03b2, we can make g into an adjoint equivalence\n(g, g\u2217 , \u03b7 \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 ) over (g, g \u2217 , \u03b7, \u01eb).\nProof: First make the equivalence f into an adjoint equivalence (f, f1 , \u03b71 , \u01eb1 ). Then (P f, P f1 , P \u03b71 , P \u01eb1 ) is\nan adjoint equivalence in B. The isomorphism \u03b2 : g \u223c\n= P f1\n= P f determines a unique isomorphism \u03b2 \u2217 : g \u2217 \u223c\nmaking the diagram\n\u03b7\n/ g\u2217g\n1\ng\u2217 \u03b2\n\nP \u03b71\n\n\u000f\n/ g \u2217 .P f\n\n\u000f\n\nP f1 .P f\n\nP (\u03b2 \u2217 )\u22121 .P f\n\ncommute. Lift \u03b2 \u2217 : g \u2217 \u223c\n= f1 over \u03b2 \u2217 . Let \u03b7 \u2032 : 1 \u2192 g\u2217 g be the isomorphism\n= P f1 to an isomorphism \u03b2 \u2217 : g \u2217 \u223c\n1\n\n\u03b71\n\n/ f1 f\n\n\u03b2\u2217\n\n\u22121\n\n.f\n\n/ g \u2217 .f\n\ng\u2217 .\u03b2\n\n\u22121\n\n/ g\u2217 .g\n\nand now observe that P \u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7 by the defining property of \u03b2 \u2217 .\nNow g is isomorphic to the equivalence f , and so is itself an equivalence. We have an isomorphism\n\u03b7\u2032 : 1 \u223c\n= 1 for which (g, g \u2217 , \u03b7 \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 ) is an adjoint\n= g \u2217 g, and so there is a unique isomorphism \u01eb\u2032 : gg \u2217 \u223c\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2217\n\u2217\nequivalence in E. But then (P g, P g , P \u03b7 , P \u01eb ) and (g, g , \u03b7, \u01eb) are both adjoint equivalences in B, with\nP g = g, P g \u2217 = g \u2217 , and P \u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7; so finally P \u01eb\u2032 = \u01eb, since the unit of an adjunction determines the counit.\n\u0003\nOur condition (ii*) is now that F : A \u2192 B has the adjoint-biequivalence-lifting property: given E \u2208 E,\nB \u2208 B, f : B \u2192 F E and g : F E \u2192 B along with \u03b7, \u01eb, S, and T giving an adjoint biequivalence in B, there\nexist D \u2208 E and f \u2032 : D \u2192 E, g \u2032 : E \u2192 D, \u03b7 \u2032 : 1 \u2192 g \u2032 f \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 : f \u2032 g \u2032 \u2192 1, S \u2032 : \u01eb\u2032 f \u2032 .f \u2032 \u03b7 \u2032 , T \u2032 : 1 \u2192 g \u2032 \u01eb\u2032 .\u03b7 \u2032 g \u2032 forming\nan adjoint biequivalence in E, with F f \u2032 = f , F g \u2032 = g, F \u03b7 \u2032 = \u03b7, F \u01eb\u2032 = \u01eb, F S \u2032 = S, and F T \u2032 = T .\nAny Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B which is a fibration on the homs and has the adjoint-biequivalence-lifting\nproperty is certainly a fibration: for given A \u2208 A and an isomorphism B \u223c\n= F A in \u03c0\u2217 B, we can represent the\nisomorphism by a biequivalence f : B \u2192 F A in B, and then extend this to an adjoint biequivalence (involving\ng, \u03b7, \u01eb, and so on), which by assumption can be lifted to an adjoint biequivalence involving f \u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 A\nand other data, lying above the original adjoint biequivalence. In particular f \u2032 represents an isomorphism\nA\u2032 \u223c\n= A in \u03c0\u2217 A lying over the original isomorphism B \u223c\n= F A in \u03c0\u2217 B. The harder part is:\nProposition 3.4 Every fibration satisfies the adjoint-biequivalence-lifting property.\nProof: Let P : E \u2192 B be a fibration. Let E, B, f , g, \u03b7, \u01eb, S, and T be an adjoint biequivalence as\nabove. Then f determines an isomorphism B \u223c\n= F E in \u03c0\u2217 B, which can be lifted to an isomorphism D \u223c\n=E\nin \u03c0\u2217 E, and this isomorphism can be represented by a biequivalence f0 : D \u2192 E in E, with P D = B and\nP f0 equivalent in B(B, P E) to f . Since P : E(D, E) \u2192 B(B, P E) is a fibration in 2-Cat, we can lift the\nequivalence P f0 \u2243 f to an equivalence f0 \u2243 f \u2032 , so that P f \u2032 = f ; also f \u2032 is equivalent to the biequivalence f0\n\n9\n\n\fso is itself a biequivalence. Thus we have lifted the biequivalence f : B \u2192 P E to a biequivalence f \u2032 : D \u2192 E;\nwe must now lift the remaining components of the adjoint biequivalence.\nBy Proposition 3.1, we can make f \u2032 into an adjoint biequivalence in E via (g1 : E \u2192 D, \u03b71 , \u01eb1 , S1 , T1 ),\nand now its image (f, P g1 , P \u03b71 , P \u01eb1 , P S1 , P T1 ) under P is an adjoint biequivalence in B. But (f, g, \u03b7, \u01eb, S, T )\nis also an adjoint biequivalence, so the composite\ng\n\nP \u03b71 .g\n\nP g1 .\u01eb\n\n/ P g1 .f.g\n\n/ P g1\n\nis (part of) an adjoint equivalence, and so can be lifted to an adjoint equivalence \u03b1 : g \u2032 \u2192 g1 in E(D, E),\nwhich in turn gives an adjoint equivalence\nf \u2032\u03b1\n\nf \u2032g\u2032\n\n\u01eb1\n\n/ f \u2032 g1\n\n/1\n\nlying over the top leg of\nP f \u2032 .P g \u2032 UU\nUUUU\nUUPUfU\u2032 .P \u03b1\nUUUU\nUUUU\nUU*\n/ f.P g1\n/\nf.P g1 .f.g\nfg\n\u2032\nf.P g1 .\u01eb\n\nf.P \u03b7 .g\n\nP \u01eb.f g\nP\u0002 T \u2032 .g\n1\n\nP \u01eb1\n\n\u0001\n\u000f\n\n1 fg\n\n\u000f\n/1\n\n\u01eb\n\nin which the unnamed 2-cell is a pseudonaturality isomorphism.

For the adjoint\nbiequivalence lifting property, note that the structure of adjoint biequivalence can be described in terms of\nobjects, 1-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells of A satisfying certain equations; thus since Gray-Cat is locally finitely\npresentable, there is a \"universal adjoint biequivalence\": a Gray-category E, with the property that adjoint\nbiequivalences in A are in natural bijection with Gray-functors from E to A. There are two objects of E;\nthe adjoint-biequivalence-lifting property is exactly the right lifting property with respect to one (either) of\nthe Gray-functors 1 \u2192 E. By the small object argument we conclude:\nProposition 3.6 There is a cofibrantly generated weak factorization system on Gray-Cat whose right part\nis the fibrations. (The left part is what we call the trivial cofibrations.)\nRemark 3.7 Since all objects in 2-Cat are fibrant, and since there are no non-trivial biequivalences in the\nterminal Gray-category, it is clear that all objects in Gray-Cat are also fibrant.\n\n4\n\nProof of the model structure\n\nIt remains to show that the trivial cofibrations are precisely those cofibrations which are also weak equivalences. Since every trivial fibration is a fibration, certainly every trivial cofibration is a cofibration. We shall\nshow that every trivial cofibration is a weak equivalence, and then use a standard argument to show that\nalso every weak equivalence which is a cofibration is a trivial cofibration.\nThe key step in this proof is the existence of path objects:\nProposition 4.1 Path objects exist in Gray-Cat: for every Gray-category B there exists a Gray-category\nPB and a factorization\n(PP\u2032 )\nD /\n/ B\u00d7B\nB\nPB\nof the diagonal into a weak equivalence followed by a fibration.\n\n11\n\n\fProof: Define a Gray-category PB as follows:\n\u2022 an object is a biequivalence a : A \u2192 A\u2032 in B\n\u2022 a 1-cell from a : A \u2192 A\u2032 to b : B \u2192 B \u2032 consists of 1-cells f : A \u2192 B and f \u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 B \u2032 in B, and an\nequivalence \u03c6 : bf \u2243 f \u2032 a\n\u2022 a 2-cell from (f, f \u2032 , \u03c6) to (g, g \u2032 , \u03c8) consists of 2-cells \u03be : f \u2192 g and \u03be \u2032 : f \u2032 \u2192 g \u2032 equipped with an\ninvertible 3-cell \u039e between\n\nf\n\na\n\nA\n\u03be\n_\n__\n_ +3\n\u0019 \u0005\nB\n\ng\n\nb\n\n/ A\u2032\n__\u03c8__ +3\n{\n/ B\u2032\n\nA\ng\u2032\n\nf\n\n__\u03c6\n\n__ +3\n$\nB\n\na\n\n/ A\u2032\n\u2032\n_\u03be__ +3\nf\u2032 _\n\u0018 \u0006\n/ B\u2032\nb\n\ng\u2032\n\n\u2022 a 3-cell from (\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u039e) to (\u03b6, \u03b6 \u2032 , Z) is a pair of 3-cells M : \u03be \u2192 \u03b6 and M \u2032 : \u03be \u2032 \u2192 \u03b6 \u2032 satisfying the evident\ncompatibility condition.\nThis is made into a Gray-category in the obvious way. One now checks that\n\u2022 a 1-cell (f, f \u2032 , \u03c6) in PB is a biequivalence if and only if f and f \u2032 are biequivalences in B\n\u2022 a 2-cell (\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u039e) in PB is an equivalence if and only if \u03be and \u03be \u2032 are equivalences in B\n\u2022 a 3-cell (M, M \u2032 ) in PB is invertible if and only if M and M \u2032 are so in B.\nThere are evident projections P, P \u2032 : PB \u2192 B which are Gray-functors, and the diagonal \u2206 : B \u2192 B \u00d7 B\nfactorizes as\n(PP\u2032 )\nD /\n/ B\u00d7B\nB\nPB\nIt follows easily\u0001 from the characterization of biequivalences, equivalences, and isomorphisms in PB given\nabove, that PP\u2032 is a fibration. It is also straightforward to check that D is a weak equivalence.\n\u0003\nWe now complete the proof of the theorem using a standard argument. We are to show that the trivial\ncofibrations are precisely the cofibrations which are weak equivalences.\nSuppose first that F is a trivial cofibration; we have already observed that F is a cofibration, so we must\nshow that it is also a weak equivalence. Since A (like any object) is fibrant, there exists a map G : B \u2192 A\nwith GF = 1.\n\u0001\nNow F is a trivial cofibration and PP\u2032 a fibration, so there is a lifting H as in\nA\n\nF\n\nD\n\n/B\nH\n\nF\n\n\u000f\nB\n\n(F1G)\n\n/6 PB\n(PP\u2032 )\n\u000f\n/ B \u00d7 B.\n\nSince D is a weak equivalence and P D = P \u2032 D = 1, both P and P \u2032 are weak equivalences. Since P H = 1 and\nP is a weak equivalence, H is a weak equivalence. Since P \u2032 H = F G and P \u2032 and H are weak equivalences,\nF G is a weak equivalence.\nFinally F is a retract of F G, since GF = 1, and so F is indeed a weak equivalence. This proves that\nevery trivial cofibration is a weak equivalence and a cofibration; we now turn to the converse.\nIf F is both a weak equivalence and a cofibration, factorize it as F = QJ, where J is a trivial cofibration\nand Q a fibration. Now F and J are weak equivalences, so Q is a weak equivalence, and hence a trivial\nfibration. But now since F is a cofibration, and factorizes through Q by J, it is a retract of J and hence is\nitself a trivial cofibration.\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 2.2.\n\u0003\n\n12\n\n\f5\n\nGray-groupoids\n\nIn this section we restrict from general Gray-categories to Gray-groupoids: these are Gray-categories in\nwhich all l-cells, 2-cells, and 3-cells are (strictly) invertible. The Gray-groupoids form a full subcategory\nGray-Gpd of Gray-Cat. Since the structure of of Gray-category and that of Gray-groupoid are both\nessentially algebraic, and the inclusion is given by forgetting some of this algebraic structure, it has a left\nadjoint, and so the full subcategory is reflective. We shall show that the model structure on Gray-Cat\nrestricts to Gray-Gpd.\nGray-groupoids were called algebraic homotopy 3-types in [4], and we shall see that they do indeed provide\na model for homotopy 3-types - this is due originally to Joyal and Tierney, in unpublished but widely\nadvertised work; here, we shall give a functorial and model-theoretic proof. The relationship between Graygroupoids and homotopy 3-types has also been studied in [1] and [14]; see the introduction for comments\nabout the relationship with [1].\nTheorem 5.1 There is a combinatorial model structure on Gray-Gpd for which a morphism is a fibration\nor weak equivalence if and only if it is one in Gray-Cat.\nProof: The cofibrations are then morphisms with the left lifting property with respect to the trivial\nfibrations, and the trivial cofibrations are the morphisms with the left lifting property with respect to the\nfibrations. The existence of the weak factorization systems is immediate. Once again every trivial cofibration\nis a cofibration; we have to show that a cofibration is trivial if and only if it is a weak equivalence. This will\nfollow exactly as before provided that we can construct path objects in Gray-Gpd; and this will certainly\nbe the case if our path object PB (in Gray-Cat) is a Gray-groupoid whenever B is one.\nSuppose then that B is a Gray-groupoid, and consider the Gray-category PB. A 3-cell (between specified\n2-cells) consists of a pair (M, M \u2032 ) of 3-cells in B satisfying a compatibility condition. Since B is a Graygroupoid, both M and M \u2032 are invertible, and so the 3-cell (M, M \u2032 ) in PB is invertible. A 2-cell, between\nspecified 1-cells (f, \u03c6) : a \u2192 b and (f \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 : a \u2192 b), consists of 2-cells \u03be : f \u2192 g and \u03be \u2032 : f \u2032 \u2192 g \u2032 in B\nequipped with an invertible 3-cell \u039e. Since B is a Gray-groupoid, \u03be and \u03be \u2032 have inverses \u03be \u22121 and \u03be \u2032\u22121 ,\nand these become an inverse to (\u03be, \u03be \u2032 , \u039e) when equipped with the 3-cell \u03be \u2032\u22121 a.\u039e\u22121 .b\u03be \u22121 : \u03c6.b\u03be \u22121 \u223c\n= \u03be \u2032\u22121 a.\u03c8.\nThus all 2-cells in PB are invertible. It remains to show that every 1-cell in PB is invertible. A 1-cell from\na : A \u2192 A\u2032 to b : B \u2192 B \u2032 consists of 1-cells f : A \u2192 B and f \u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 B \u2032 in B, equipped with an equivalence\n\u03c6 : bf \u2243 f \u2032 a. But since B is a Gray-groupoid, f and f \u2032 have inverses f \u22121 and f \u2032\u22121 , and \u03c6 is not just an\nequivalence but an isomorphism; and now f \u22121 and f \u2032\u22121 become an inverse for (f, f \u2032 , \u03c6) when equipped with\n\u0003\nthe 2-cell f \u2032\u22121 .\u03c6\u22121 .f \u22121 : af \u22121 = f \u2032\u22121 f \u2032 af \u22121 \u223c\n= f \u2032\u22121 bf f \u22121 = f \u2032\u22121 b.\nIn this restricted version, the description of fibrations becomes simpler. A Gray-functor P : E \u2192 B\nbetween Gray-groupoids is a fibration when the following conditions hold:\n\u2022 for every E \u2208 E and every 1-cell f : B \u2192 P E in B there is a lifting f \u2032 : D \u2192 E in E\n\u2022 for every f : D \u2192 E in E and every 2-cell \u03b2 : b \u2192 P f in B there is a lifting \u03b3 : d \u2192 f in E\n\u2022 for every 2-cell \u03b1 : f \u2192 g : D \u2192 E in E and every 3-cell M : \u03b2 \u2192 P \u03b1 in B there is a lifting M \u2032 : \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b1\nin E\nA Gray-functor F : E \u2192 B between Gray-groupoids is a weak equivalence when the following conditions\nhold:\n\u2022 for every B \u2208 B there is an E \u2208 E and a morphism f : B \u2192 F E\n\u2022 for all D, E \u2208 E and every b : F D \u2192 F E in B there is a morphism f : D \u2192 E in E and a 2-cell\n\u03b2 : b \u2192 P f in B\n\u2022 for all \u03b1, \u03b2 : f \u2192 g : D \u2192 E in E and every 3-cell Y : P \u03b1 \u2192 P \u03b2 in B there is a 3-cell X : \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 with\nPX = Y .\n\n13\n\n\fIn [1], an adjunction between Gray-groupoids and simplicial sets was described, with the right adjoint\nN : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet giving the nerve of a Gray-groupoid; we shall write \u03a03 for the left adjoint.\nProposition 5.2 The nerve functor N : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations, and\nso is the right adjoint part of a Quillen adjunction.\nProof: Suppose first that F : A \u2192 B is a trivial fibration in Gray-Gpd. We must show that N F : N A \u2192\nN B is a trivial fibration of simplicial sets; in other words, that it has the right lifting property with respect\nto the inclusion \u2202\u2206[n] \u2192 \u2206[n] for all n. For n = 0 this is the fact that F is surjective on objects and for\nn = 1 it is the fact that F is full on 1-cells. For n = 2 it says that for any 1-cells f : A \u2192 B, g : B \u2192 C and\nh : A \u2192 C in A, and any 2-cell \u03b2 : F g.F f \u2192 F h in B, there is a 2-cell \u03b1 : gf \u2192 h in A with F \u03b1 = \u03b2; this\nholds since F is full on 2-cells (F is locally full). For n = 3 it becomes a little more complicated. Consider\n2-cells in A as in the diagram\nf12\n/\nAC 1\nA\n\u0007\nqq8 2777\n\u03b1012\nq\n\u0007\nq\n\u0013q\n77 f\n\u0007\nf01 \u0007\u0007\n77 23\nqqq \u03b1023\nq\n\u0007\nq\n\u0013\n77\nq\n\u0007\nf\n02\nq\n\u0007 q\n7\u001b\n\u0007\u0007qqq\n/ 3\nA\nA0\n\nf12\n/ 27\nAC 1 MM\nA\n\u0007\nM\n\u03b1123 77\nM\n\u0007\nM\n7\nM\u0013 MM\n\u0007\nf01 \u0007\u0007\nMMM 777f23\n\u03b1013\n\u0007\n\u0013\nMMM 77\nf13\n\u0007\u0007\nMM7& \u001b\n\u0007\u0007\n/ 3\nA\nA0\n\nf03\n\nf03\n\nwhere the left composite may be written as \u03b1023 .f23 \u03b1012 and the right composite as \u03b1013 .\u03b1123 f01 . Apply F\nto each side, and suppose that we have a 3-cell Y : F (\u03b1023 .f23 \u03b1012 ) \u2192 F (\u03b1013 .\u03b1123 f01 ) between the resulting\n2-cells in B. The case n = 3 amounts to the fact that there is a 3-cell X : \u03b1023 .f23 \u03b1012 \u2192 \u03b1013 .\u03b1123 f01 in A\nwith F X = Y ; this is true since F : A \u2192 B is full on 3-cells (locally locally full). For n > 3, an n-simplex\nin the nerve of a Gray-groupoid does not involve further data, it just amounts to the assertion that two\npasting composites (with the same 2-cells as domain and codomain) of 3-cells are equal. Since F is faithful\non 3-cells (locally locally faithful), such assertions can be lifted from B to A, and so all remaining conditions\nhold. This proves that N F is a trivial fibration.\nSuppose now that F : A \u2192 B is a fibration in Gray-Gpd. We must show that N F : N A \u2192 N B is a\nfibration of simplicial sets (a Kan fibration); in other words, that it has the left lifting property with respect\nto the horns \u039br [n] \u2192 \u2206[n].\nFor n = 1, this says that given A \u2208 A and a 1-cell f : B \u2192 F A in B there is a 1-cell f \u2032 : A\u2032 \u2192 A with\nF A\u2032 = B and F f \u2032 = f , as well as a corresponding statement involving 1-cells F A \u2192 B. This first is part of\nour characterization of fibrations; the second an easy consequence of it, given that every 1-cell is invertible.\nFor n = 2 and r = 1, this says that given f : A \u2192 B and g : B \u2192 C in A and a 2-cell \u03b2 : F g.F f \u2192 k in\nB there is a 1-cell h : A \u2192 C with F h = k and a 2-cell \u03b1 : gf \u2192 h with F \u03b1 = \u03b2. This is once again part of\nour characterization of fibrations in Gray-Gpd.\nFor n = 2 and r = 0 we start with 1-cells g : A \u2192 B and u : A \u2192 C in A, and a 1-cell v : F B \u2192 F C and\n2-cell \u03b3 : v.F f \u2192 F u in B, as in the solid parts of the diagram below.\nB\nC\n\u0007\u0007\n\u0007\ng \u0007\u0007\n\u03b4 \u0013\n\u0007\u0007\n\u0007\n\u0007\n\u0007\nA\nu\n\nw\n\n7\u2192\n/\u001b\nC\n\nFC B7\n\u0007\u0007 777\n\u0007\n77v\nF g \u0007\u0007\n\u03b3\n77\n\u0013\n\u0007\u0007\n77\n\u0007\n\u0007\u0007\n/ \u001bC\nFA\nF\nFu\n\nWe must construct a 1-cell w : B \u2192 C in A with F w = v and a 2-cell \u03b4 : wg \u2192 u with F \u03b4 = \u03b3. Let\nf = u\u22121 and k = v \u22121 . Then v 1 .v.F g.F f = F g.F f and v \u22121 .F u.F f = k.F u.F u\u22121 = k, and so the 2-cell\nv \u22121 .\u03b3.F f goes from F g.F f to k. By the previous paragraph there is a 2-cell \u03b1 : gf \u2192 h in A with F h = k\nand F \u03b1 = v \u22121 .\u03b3.F f . Let w = h\u22121 and \u03b4 = w\u03b1u : wgf u \u2192 whu. Then wgf u = wgu\u22121 u = wg and\nwhu = h\u22121 hu = u, and so \u03b4 is indeed a 2-cell from wg to u. Also F w = F h\u22121 = (F h)\u22121 = k \u22121 = v, while\nF \u03b4 = F w.F \u03b1.F u = F w.v \u22121 .\u03b3.F f.F u = F h\u22121 .k.\u03b3.F u\u22121 .F u = \u03b3, and so the condition does hold. The case\nn = r = 2 is similar.\n\n14\n\n\fFor n = 3, we start with objects A0 , A1 , A2 , and A3 of A, with 1-cells fij : Ai \u2192 Aj for 0 \u2264 i < j \u2264 3.\nFor 0 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 3 with r \u2208 {i, j, k} we have a 2-cell \u03b1ijk : fjk fij \u2192 fik in A. For the choice of\n0 \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 3 with r \u2208\n/ {i, j, k} there is a 2-cell \u03b2ijk : F (fjk fij ) \u2192 F fik in B, and finally a 3-cell Y .\nbetween the two pasting composites.\nWe treat the case r = 1 in detail. The \"missing 2-cell\" is \u03b1023 : f23 f02 \u2192 f03 . Since \u03b1012 is an equivalence,\nwe can find a 2-cell \u03b1\u2032023 : f23 f02 \u2192 f03 and a 3-cell X \u2032 : \u03b1\u2032023 .f23 \u03b1012 \u2192 \u03b1013 .\u03b1123 f01 . Applying F gives\na 3-cell F X \u2032 : F \u03b1\u2032023 .F (f23 \u03b1012 ) \u2192 F \u03b1013 .F (\u03b1123 f01 ), but we also have a 3-cell Y : \u03b2023 .F (f23 \u03b1012 ) \u2192\nF \u03b1013 .F (\u03b1123 f01 ), and now there is a unique 3-cell Z : \u03b2023 \u2192 F \u03b1\u2032023 which pastes onto F X \u2032 to give Y . We\ncan lift this to a 3-cell W : \u03b1023 \u2192 \u03b1\u2032023 with F \u03b1023 = \u03b2023 and F W = Z. Finally pasting W onto X \u2032 gives\na 3-cell X : \u03b1023 .f23 \u03b1012 \u2192 \u03b1013 .\u03b1123 f01 over Y .\nThe case r = 2 is similar to that of r = 1.

Similarly the case r = 3\ncan be reduced to r = 2 by taking inverses.\nSince we are dealing with nerves of Gray-groupoids, all horns have unique fillers for n \u2265 4, and so the\ncondition is automatic.\n\u0003\n\nBy Ken Brown's lemma [8, Lemma 1.1.12], N takes all weak equivalences between fibrant objects to weak\nequivalences; but all objects of Gray-Gpd are fibrant, and so in fact N also preserves weak equivalences. By\na similar argument, using the fact that all objects of SSet are cofibrant, \u03a03 also preserves weak equivalences.\nWe record this as\nProposition 5.3 Both the nerve functor N : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet and its left adjoint \u03a03 : SSet \u2192\nGray-Gpd preserve weak equivalences.\n\u0003\nQuillen adjunctions induce derived adjunctions between the homotopy categories. Since \u03a03 preserves\nweak equivalences and all objects of SSet are cofibrant, the simplicial sets X for which the unit of the\nderived adjunction is invertible are precisely those for which the unit X \u2192 N \u03a03 X of the Quillen adjunction\nis a weak equivalence. Berger showed in [1, Proposition 3.2] that for a simplicial set X, the unit X \u2192 N \u03a03 X\nis a weak equivalence if and only if X is a 3-type.\nSimilarly, since N preserves weak equivalences and all objects of Gray-Gpd are fibrant, the Graygroupoids A for which the counit of the derived adjunction is invertible are precisely those for which the\ncounit \u03a03 N A \u2192 A is a weak equivalence. Once we have shown that this holds for all Gray-groupoids,\nthen we shall have constructed an equivalence between the homotopy categories of Gray-groupoids and the\nhomotopy category of simplicial 3-types.\nTheorem 5.4 The Quillen adjunction between Gray-Gpd and SSet induces an equivalence between the\nhomotopy categories of algebraic homotopy 3-types and simplicial homotopy 3-types.\nProof: We need to show that the counit map E : \u03a03 N A \u2192 A is a triequivalence of Gray-categories. An\nobject of \u03a03 N A is a 0-simplex of N A; that is, an object of A. Thus \u03a03 N A and A have the same objects,\nand the counit map E : \u03a03 N A \u2192 A is the identity on objects.\nThe 1-cells of \u03a03 N A are freely generated by the non-degenerate 1-simplices of N A together with formal\ninverses; that is, by the non-identity 1-cells of A together with formal inverses. We write a typical such 1-cell\nas f or [fn ] . . . [f1 ], where the fi are 1-cells in A or their formal inverses. Any non-identity 1-cell in A can\n\n15\n\n\fbe realized as the composite of such a word of length 1 (or 0 in the case of an identity), and so the counit\nE : \u03a03 N A \u2192 A is surjective (and full) on 1-cells.\nThe 2-cells of \u03a03 N A are obtained by freely adjoining an invertible 2-cell [f2 ][f1 ] \u2192 [f ] for each 2-cell\n\u03c6 : f2 f1 \u2192 f which is \"non-degenerate\" in the sense that no more than one of f1 , f2 , and \u03c6 are identities.\nNow a general 1-cell in \u03a03 N A is a word [fn ] . . . [f2 ][f1 ] in the 1-cells of A and their formal inverses. But\nin fact any such 1-cell is isomorphic in \u03a03 N A to an identity or to a word consisting of a single 1-cell in A.\nTo see this, first observe that if f : A \u2192 B is any 1-cell in A, then it has an inverse, say g, and now the\nequations gf = 1 and f g = 1 can be seen 2-simplices, and so force g to be isomorphic to the formal inverse\nf \u22121 . So any word [fn ] . . . [f2 ][f1 ] is isomorphic to one not involving any formal inverses. But now the word\n[f2 ][f1 ] is isomorphic to the actual composite [f2 f1 ], and by an easy induction any longer word is likewise\nisomorphic to an arrow in A.\nWe now turn to the fullness on 2-cells of E : \u03a03 N A \u2192 A. It suffices to show fullness on 2-cells [f ] \u2192 [g],\nwhere f and g are 1-cells in A. Any 2-cell \u03c6 : [f ] \u2192 [g] in A can be regarded as a 2-cell \u03c6 : [f ][1] = [f ] \u2192 [g],\nand so we do indeed have fullness on 2-cells.\nThe 3-cells of \u03a03 N A are once again obtained by adjoining invertible 3-cells\nf12\n/8 27\nAC 1\nqA\n77\n\u0007\nq\n\u03b1012\nq\n\u0007\n\u0013 qq\n77 f\n\u0007\nq\nf01 \u0007\u0007\nq\n77 23\nq\n\u03b1023\nq\n\u0007\nq\n\u0013\n77\n\u0007 qqq f02\n\u0007\n7\u001b\n\u0007\u0007qqq\n/ 3\nA\nA0\n\n\u223c\n=\n\nf03\n\nf12\n/ 27\nAC 1 MM\nA\n7\n\u0007\nM\n\u03b1\n123 7\nM\n\u0007\nMM\u0013 M\n7\n\u0007\nf01 \u0007\u0007\nM\nMMM 777f23\n\u03b1013\n\u0007\n\u0013\nMMM 77\nf13\n\u0007\u0007\nMM7& \u001b\n\u0007\u0007\n/ 3\nA\nA0\nf03\n\nbetween the formal composites on either side of the diagram, for each 3-cell in A between the actual composites.

(We have not mentioned here the fact that there will generally already be some 3-cells - the pseudonaturality isomorphisms whose presence is forced whenever there are 2-cells whose horizontal composite is\nnot fully determined.)\n\u03b1\nConsider a pair of 2-cells \u03b1, \u03b2 : f \u2192 g in \u03a03 N A. We wish to show that E : \u03a03 N A \u2192 A is fully faithful\non 3-cells from \u03b1 to \u03b2. We have already seen that f and g can be replaced by isomorphic 1-cells [f ] and\n[g] coming from A. The fully faithfulness on 3-cells will not be affected by whiskering by the isomorphisms\n[f ] \u223c\n= f and [g] \u223c\n= g, so we may as well suppose that \u03b1, \u03b2 : [f ] \u2192 [g]. Furthermore, we can inductively build\nup isomorphisms [\u03b1] \u223c\n= \u03b2 in \u03a03 N A, where \u03b1, \u03b2 : f \u2192 g are now 2-cells in A.

This gives fullness on 3-cells of E.\nSuppose that X : [\u03b1] \u2192 [\u03b2] is any 3-cell in \u03a03 N A. Then X can be built up as a formal composite of\n3-cells in A; this involves whiskering by 2-cells or 1-cells, and vertical composition of 3-cells. We can always\nuse the previous arguments to restrict to the case where these 3-cells have domain and codomain 2-cells\ncoming from A (in other words, of the from [\u03b3] or [\u03b4] for 2-cells \u03b3 or \u03b4 in A).\nIf X itself has the form [Y ] for some 3-cell Y : \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2 in A, then clearly X = EX = E[Y ] = Y , and so\nX = [Y ] = [EX]. We now prove inductively that X = [EX] for any X : [\u03b1] \u2192 [\u03b2]. Any such X has the\nform [Xn ] . . . [X1 ]; for simplicity we give only the case X = [X2 ][X1 ]; the general inductive step is essentially\n\n16\n\n\fthe same, but the notation becomes more complicated. Write Y = X2 X1 , and write \u03b3 for the domain of X2\nand codomain of X1 . Then we are to prove that X = [Y ].\nThere is a 4-simplex\nO\no|o||o||A OOOO\no\no\n|\nO\no\nA |||||||\nkkA44\nk\nk\nkk\n||\n44 f\n||||| kkkkkk \u03b1\n44\n|\n|\n\u0013\nk\n|\nk\n4\u001a\n|k|||k|kk\n/\nA\nB\ng\nnn\nn\nA\nn\nAA\nnn\nAA\nooAOOOOO\no\no\nAA\nO\noo\nAA\nkA4\nA\nk\nk\nAAX1\n44\nkk\nk\nk\nAA\n44f\nkkk\n\u03b1\nk\nAA\nk\n4\n\u0013\nk\nk\n4\u001a\nk\nAA\nkkk\nAA\n/\nA\nB\ng\nAA\noo|o||AOBBOBO OOO\nBB\noo|o|||||\nBB A4\nA ||||\nB 4\n|\n\u03b3\n|\n|\n|\ng BBB44 f\n|\n\u0013\n|\n|\nBB44\n|||\nB4! \u001a\n|||||\n/B\nA\ng\n}\n}}\n}\n}}\n}}\n}\n}}\n}} X2\n}\n}}\n}}\n}\n}~ }\n\nY\n\nA\n\n\u000f\nOO O\no\nA\no\no\nOOO\no\no\no\nASSSSS\nA44\nSSS f\n44 f\nS\nSSS\nSSS 444\n\u0013\u03b2\nSSS \u001a\n) /B\ng\nPPP\nPPP\n\nA\n\noooAOBBOBOOO\nBB O\noSoo\nB A\nA SSSS\nf4\nSSS f BBBB444 f\nS\nS\nSSS BB44\n\u0013\u03b2\nSSS BB4\nSS)/! \u001a\nB\ng\n\nin N A, and so in \u03a03 N A there is a relation [X2 ][X1 ] = [Y ], which is just to say X = [EX].\nThis now proves the faithfulness on 3-cells.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 5.5 The model structure on Gray-Gpd is obtained by transporting along the nerve functor\nN : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet the model structure on SSet.\nProof: We know that N preserves weak equivalences, fibrations, and trivial fibrations; in other words that\nif a Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B is a weak equivalence, fibration, or trivial fibration, then so is N F . It remains\nto show the converse of each of these three statements; in fact, it will suffice to do two of the three.\nSuppose first that N F is a weak equivalence in SSet. Then \u03a03 N F is a weak equivalence in Gray-Gpd;\nbut E : \u03a03 N A \u2192 A and E : \u03a03 N B \u2192 B are weak equivalences, then so is F .\nNow suppose that N F is a trivial fibration in SSet. Then certainly it has the right lifting property with\nrespect to the inclusion \u2202\u22060 \u2192 \u22060 ; and so by adjointness F has the right lifting property with respect to\n\u03a03 \u2202\u22060 \u2192 \u03a03 \u22060 ; but this is just the unique map from the initial Gray-groupoid to the terminal one, so the\nright lifting property says that F is surjective on objects.\nSimilarly, N F has the right lifting property with respect to \u2202\u22061 \u2192 \u22061 , and so F is full on 1-cells.\nFullness on 2-cells and 3-cells is slightly more complicated, since Gray-categories have a globular rather\n\n17\n\n\fthan a simplicial structure. We can build a simplicial model \"22 \" of a parallel pair\n$\n\n\u2022\n\n:\u2022\n\nby taking the coproduct \u22061 + \u22061 and identifying the boundaries. Similarly we can build a simplicial model\n\"22 \" of a (globular) 2-cell\n\u2022\n\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f\n\u0013\n\n$\n\n:\u2022\n\nby collapsing one of the faces of a 2-simplex. The inclusion 22 \u2192 22 is a monomorphism, so its image under\n\u03a03 is a cofibration; it follows that F is full on 2-cells.\nFullness on 3-cells is once again proved by a constructing simplicial model of a parallel pair of 2-cells,\nand a simplicial model of a 3-cell, and observing that the inclusion is a monomorphism.\nFinally, faithfulness on 3-cells can be interpreted as \"fullness on 4-cells\": think of a Gray-category as some\nsort of 4-dimensional category in which there are no non-identity 4-cells; then equality of 3-cells becomes\nthe existence of a (necessarily trivial) 4-cell between them. Let f, g : A \u2192 B be 1-cells in A, with 2-cells\n\u03b1, \u03b2 : f \u2192 g and 3-cells M, M \u2032 : \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b2. We need to show that F M = F M \u2032 implies that M = M \u2032 ; in other\nwords that any 4-cell F M \u2192 F M \u2032 is in the image under F of a 4-cell M \u2192 M \u2032 . This can once again be\nexpressed simplicially.\n\u0003\n\n6\n\nLocalizations of SSet\n\nIn this section we describe the relationship between n-groupoids and homotopy n-types (for small n) in\nterms of Bousfield localizations [7] of SSet. For each n, let gn be the inclusion \u2202\u2206n+2 \u2192 \u2206n+2 . The\nlocalizations we consider will be with respect to these maps gn . (Once could also use the image of the\ninclusion S n+1 \u2192 Dn+2 in Top under the singular functor Top \u2192 SSet as gn .)\nWe start by recalling the well-understood situation for n = 1. The nerve functor N : Gpd \u2192 SSet for\ngroupoids has a left adjoint \u03a01 : SSet \u2192 Gpd sending a simplicial set to its fundamental groupoid [2]. The\nnerve functor preserves fibrations and trivial fibrations, so is a right Quillen functor. The left adjoint \u03a01\ntherefore preserves all cofibrations and trivial cofibrations. But since all objects of SSet are cofibrant, and\nall objects of Gpd are fibrant, in fact both functors preserve weak equivalences. The fundamental groupoid\n\u03a01 (X) of a simplicial set agrees with the ordinary fundamental groupoid \u03a01 |X| of the geometric realization\nof X.\nNow the nerve functor is fully faithful, so the counit \u03a01 N \u2192 1 is invertible, and so \u03a01 can be thought\nof as a reflection onto a full subcategory. The unit is not invertible, and \u03a01 does destroy information:\nin particular, it destroys all homotopical information in dimension greater than 1. More precisely, for a\nmorphism f : X \u2192 Y of simplicial sets, the induced functor \u03a01 (f ) : \u03a01 (X) \u2192 \u03a01 (Y ) is an equivalence\nif and only if f induces a bijection \u03c00 f : \u03c00 X \u2192 \u03c00 Y between the sets of connected components, and an\nisomorphism \u03c01 f : \u03c01 (X, x) \u2192 \u03c01 (Y, f x) of fundamental groups for all choices of basepoint x \u2208 X.\nRecall that g1 is the inclusion \u2202\u22063 \u2192 \u22063 . Let P1 SSet be the Bousfield localization of SSet with respect\nto the map g1 . The weak equivalences are precisely the morphisms f : X \u2192 Y of simplicial sets for which\n\u03a01 (f ) : \u03a01 (X) \u2192 \u03a01 (Y ) is an equivalence, and the cofibrations are the usual cofibrations of simplicial sets\n(the monomorphisms). Thus the Quillen adjunction between Gpd and SSet passes to a Quillen adjunction\nbetween Gpd and P1 SSet, which is now a Quillen equivalence.\nNext we turn to the case n = 2. Once again there is a nerve functor N : 2-Gpd \u2192 SSet. This nerve\nof a 2-groupoid is a special case of Street's nerve of a bicategory. As observed in [17], this nerve functor\nN : 2-Gpd \u2192 SSet is the right adjoint part of a Quillen adjunction. We shall write \u03a02 for the left adjoint,\ncalled W in [17]. Once again N and \u03a02 both preserve weak equivalences; a simplicial map f : X \u2192 Y\ninduces a weak equivalence of 2-groupoids if and only if it induces a bijection \u03c00 (f ) : \u03c00 (X) \u2192 \u03c00 (Y ) of sets,\n\n18\n\n\fand isomorphisms \u03c01 (f ) : \u03c01 (X, x) \u2192 \u03c01 (Y, f x) and \u03c02 (f ) : \u03c02 (X, x) \u2192 \u03c02 (Y, y) of groups for all basepoints\nx \u2208 X.\nLet P2 SSet be the Bousfield localization of SSet with respect to the map g2 . This has the same\ncofibrations as SSet, and f : X \u2192 Y is a weak equivalence in P2 SSet if and only if \u03a02 (f ) : \u03a02 (X) \u2192 \u03a02 (Y )\nis one in 2-Gpd. The Quillen adjunction \u03a02 \u22a3 N : 2-Gpd \u2192 SSet passes to a Quillen equivalence between\n2-Gpd and P2 SSet.\nFinally, we turn to the case n = 3. We saw in the previous section that the nerve functor N :\nGray-Gpd \u2192 SSet of [1] is the right adjoint part of a Quillen adjunction; we write \u03a03 for the left adjoint\npart. Once again N and \u03a03 both preserve weak equivalences; a simplicial map f : X \u2192 Y induces a weak\nequivalence of Gray-groupoids if and only if it induces a bijection \u03c00 (f ) : \u03c00 (X) \u2192 \u03c00 (Y ) of sets, and\nisomorphisms \u03c0n (f ) : \u03c0n (X, x) \u2192 \u03c0n (Y, f x) of groups for all basepoints x \u2208 X, and all n \u2208 {1, 2, 3}.\nLet P3 SSet be the Bousfield localization of SSet with respect to the map g3 . This has the same\ncofibrations as SSet, and f : X \u2192 Y is a weak equivalence in P3 SSet if and only if \u03a03 (f ) : \u03a03 (X) \u2192 \u03a03 (Y )\nis one in Gray-Gpd. The Quillen adjunction \u03a03 \u22a3 N : Gray-Gpd \u2192 SSet passes to a Quillen equivalence\nbetween Gray-Gpd and P3 SSet.\n\n7\n\nTricategories\n\nWe conjecture that the model structure on Gray-Cat can be extended to the context of tricategories. To\ndo this, one should use a \"fully algebraic\" definition of tricategories, such as that of Gurski [6], so that the\ncategory Tricat of tricategories and strict morphisms of tricategories is locally presentable, and contains\nGray-Cat as a full reflective subcategory.\nThe definitions of weak equivalence and fibration still make perfectly good sense in the context of tricategories; indeed the notion of triequivalence (our weak equivalences) was first defined in that context [4].\nChoosing these weak equivalences and fibrations determines a model structure uniquely if one exists. We\nconjecture that it does. The inclusion of Gray-Cat into Tricat preserves fibrations and weak equivalences,\nand so would be the right adjoint part of a Quillen adjunction.\nWe conjecture further that this Quillen adjunction is in fact a Quillen equivalence. Since the inclusion\nI : Gray-Cat \u2192 Tricat is fully faithful, the counit LI \u2192 1 of the adjunction is invertible. Since all objects\nof Gray-Cat are fibrant, the unit of the derived adjunction will also be invertible; so it would remain only\nto show that the counit of the derived adjunction is invertible. This will be the case provided that the counit\nT \u2192 ILT is a weak equivalence for every cofibrant tricategory T, and Michael Makkai has announced [16]\nthat he has proved this to be the case.\nOn the other hand, we could consider strict 3-categories. The category 3-Cat of 3-categories and 3functors is a full reflective subcategory of Gray-Cat. The model structure on Gray-Cat lifts across the\nadjunction to give a model structure on 3-Cat for which a 3-functor is a weak equivalence or a fibration\nif and only if the corresponding Gray-functor is one. One simply applies the reflection into Gray-Cat to\neach of the generating cofibrations and generating trivial cofibrations (in fact this is only needed for one\ngenerating trivial cofibration; the other generating trivial cofibrations and the generating cofibrations are\nalready in 3-Cat) and then observes that for a 3-category B, the path object PB in Gray-Cat constructed\nabove is in fact a 3-category.\nThe inclusion of 3-Cat in Gray-Cat together with its left adjoint are then a Quillen adjunction, by construction, but they will not be a Quillen equivalence, essentially because not every 3-category is triequivalent\nto a 3-category [4].\n\n8\n\nComputads and sesquicategories\n\nWe have given explicit descriptions of the fibrations and weak equivalences, but so far the cofibrations have\nbeen defined only via a left lifting property. In the following section we investigate the cofibrations of\n\n19\n\n\fGray-Cat, and in particular, the cofibrant objects. First, however, we develop some necessary material on\nsesquicategories [18].\nFirst, recall that the functor U : 2-Cat \u2192 Cat which forgets the 2-cells of a 2-category has both a left\nadjoint D, which adds identity 2-cells to a category, and a right adjoint C, which adds a single (invertible)\n2-cell between each parallel pair of 1-cells. Both D and C are fully faithful, so the unit 1 \u2192 U D of the\nadjunction D \u22a3 U and the counit U C \u2192 1 of the adjunction U \u22a3 C are invertible.\nWe shall regard the category 2-Cat as monoidal via the Gray tensor product, and Cat as monoidal via\nthe \"funny\" tensor product \u0003. Recall, for example from [18], that \u0003 is part of a monoidal closed structure\nin which the internal hom [A, B] has as objects the functors from A to B and as morphisms from f to g, the\nset of all obA-indexed families of morphisms f a \u2192 ga, with no naturality condition imposed.\nThis determines the funny tensor product; it can be described more explicitly as follows: its objects are\npairs (a, b) of objects of A and B, while its morphisms are freely generated by morphisms of the form (\u03b1, 1b )\nand (1a , \u03b2), where \u03b1 : a \u2192 a\u2032 is a morphism in A and \u03b2 : b \u2192 b\u2032 a morphism in B; subject to relations which\nstate that (a, \u2212) and (\u2212, b) are functors. Another way to say this is A\u0003B = U (CA \u2297 CB) = U (DA \u2297 DB);\nand in fact both U and C are strong monoidal functors, while D is only opmonoidal.\nNow a category enriched in 2-Cat (with respect to the Gray tensor product) is of course a Gray-category,\nwhile a category enriched in Cat (with respect to the funny tensor product) is called a sesquicategory. Since\nthe adjunction U \u22a3 C is monoidal, we obtain an adjunction U\u2217 \u22a3 C\u2217 between Gray-Cat and SesquiCat,\nwhere U\u2217 discards the 3-cells, and C\u2217 adjoins a single (invertible) 3-cell between each parallel pair of 2-cells.\nSince D is not monoidal it does not induce a 2-functor D\u2217 , but there is nonetheless a left adjoint L to U\u2217 ,\nwhich adjoins only identity 2-cells and pseudonaturality isomorphisms. Note that the counits LU\u2217 A \u2192 A\nof the adjunction L \u22a3 U\u2217 are all bijective on objects, 1-cells, and 2-cells; they only change the 3-cells.\nWe shall also need a notion of free sesquicategory on a computad. Recall, for example from [18], that a\ncomputad consists of following structure: first of all a directed graph d, c : G1 \u2192 G0 , on which we form the\nfree category C; then a second directed graph d, c : G2 \u2192 C1 , whose vertices are the 1-cells of C; finally we\nrequire that the \"globular relations\" dd = dc and cd = cc hold, so that elements of G2 (called 2-cells) can be\nwritten as the diagram below on the left where f, g : x \u2192 y are 1-cells in C or in expanded from as in the\ndiagram on the right\n...\n?\n>>\n>> fn\nf1\n>>\nf\n>\u001f\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f\n\u001f\u001f \u001f\u001f $\n\u03b1\nx>\nx \u0013\u03b1:y\n\u0013\n?y\n>>\n>>\ng\ng1 >>\ngm\n>\u001f\n...\nin which the ellipses denote an unspecified number of further composites (the picture on the right appears\nto suggest that n \u2265 2, but in fact n could be 0 or 1). A morphism from such a computad G to a computad\nH consists of a graph morphism f from d, c : G1 \u2192 G0 to d, c : H1 \u2192 H0 , consisting of f0 : G0 \u2192 H0 and\nf1 : G1 \u2192 H1 compatible with the source and target maps; equipped with a map f2 : G2 \u2192 H2 satisfying\nthe evident compatibility condition.\nThese form a category Cmptd which, as observed by Schanuel, is in fact a presheaf category. There is a\nforgetful functor V : SesquiCat \u2192 Cmptd which sends a sesquicategory A to the computad whose 0-cells\nand 1-cells are the 0-cells and 1-cells of A , and whose 2-cells between the paths fn . . . f2 f1 \u2192 gm . . . g2 g1 are\nthe 2-cells between their composites in A .\nThis forgetful functor V has a left adjoint H \u22a3 V , which can be constructed as follows. An object of HG\nis an element of G0 . A 1-cell of HG is a path in the 1-cells of G. A \"basic 2-cell\", is an expression of the\nform l\u03b1r, where l : w \u2192 x and r : y \u2192 z are 1-cells in HG, and \u03b1 : f \u2192 g : x \u2192 y is an element of G2 . Such\na basic 2-cell has a source 1-cell lf r and target 1-cell lgr. A 2-cell of HG is a path in the basic 2-cells.\nWe shall call a sesquicategory free, if it is (isomorphic to) one of the form HG for a computad G. In [12,\nLemma 4.7] it was proved that any retract of a free category is free. We use this fact to prove an analogue\nfor sesquicategories.\n\n20\n\n\fProposition 8.1 A retract of a free sesquicategory is free.\nProof: Let G be a computad, HG the free sesquicategory on G, and let I : A \u2192 HG be a sesquifunctor\nwith a retract R : HG \u2192 A . Certainly the underlying category of HG is free, and the underlying category\nof A is a retract of it, so the underlying category of A is also free.\nAs well as the underlying category of a sesquicategory, there is also the category obtained by discarding\nthe objects: it has arrows of the sesquicategory as objects, 2-cells of the sesquicategory as arrows, and vertical\ncomposition in the sesquicategory as composition. This clearly induces a functor W : SesquiCat \u2192 Cat.\nIf A is a retract of HG then W A is a retract of W HG; but W HG is the free category on all whiskerings\nof 2-cells in HG, so W A is also free.\nIt remains to show that the generating arrows of W A are freely generated under whiskering in A by\nsome subset. Say that a 2-cell \u03b1 : f \u2192 g in A is indecomposable if it is indecomposable as an arrow of W A :\nthese indecomposable 2-cells are the generating arrows of W A . Say that such an indecomposable 2-cell is\ntotally indecomposable if moreover it cannot be written as a whiskering \u03b1 = g\u03b2f unless f and g are both\nidentities. We need to show that every indecomposable 2-cell can be written uniquely as a whiskering of a\ntotally indecomposable 2-cell.\nLet \u03b1 : f \u2192 g be any 2-cell in A , and consider its image I\u03b1 : If \u2192 Ig in HG. We can write I\u03b1\nuniquely as a composite \u03b2n . . . \u03b21 of indecomposables; and each of these can in turn be written uniquely as\na whiskering \u03b2i = ri \u03b3i li with \u03b3i totally indecomposable. Since the underlying category of HG is free, each\nri and each li has a well-defined length; write \u03c0(\u03b1) for the sum of all these lengths.\nIf there is an indecomposable 2-cell \u03b1\u2032 : f \u2032 \u2192 g \u2032 : x\u2032 \u2192 y \u2032 which is not the whiskering of any totally\nindecomposable 2-cell, then there is one with \u03c0(\u03b1\u2032 ) minimal. Then certainly \u03b1\u2032 is not totally indecomposable,\nso we can write it as a whiskering \u03b1\u2032 = r\u03b1l, where \u03b1 : f \u2192 g : x \u2192 y, and r and l are not both\nidentities. Decompose I\u03b1 as above: I\u03b1 = \u03b2n . . . \u03b21 where \u03b2i = ri \u03b3i li . But now the decomposition of I\u03b1\u2032 is\n(r\u03b2n l) . . . (r\u03b21 l), with r\u03b2i l = rri \u03b2i li l; and so \u03c0(\u03b1) < \u03c0(\u03b1\u2032 ) contradicting the minimality of \u03c0(\u03b1\u2032 ).\nThis proves that every indecomposable 2-cell is the whiskering of some totally indecomposable 2-cell. It\nremains to show the uniqueness. Suppose then that \u03b1 : f \u2192 g : x \u2192 y and \u03b1\u2032 : f \u2032 \u2192 g \u2032 : x\u2032 \u2192 y \u2032 are totally\nindecomposable 2-cells in A , and that r\u03b1l = r\u2032 \u03b1\u2032 l\u2032 for some 1-cells r : y \u2192 z, r\u2032 : y \u2032 \u2192 z, l : w \u2192 x, and\nl\u2032 : w \u2192 x\u2032 .\nWrite I\u03b1 = \u03b2n . . . \u03b21 and \u03b2i = ri \u03b3i li where each \u03b3i is totally indecomposable in HG; and similarly\nI\u03b1\u2032 = \u03b2n\u2032 \u2032 . . . \u03b21\u2032 and \u03b2i\u2032 = ri\u2032 \u03b3i\u2032 l\u2032i . Now Ir.I\u03b1.Il = I(r)rn \u03b3n ln I(l) . . . I(r)r1 \u03b31 l1 I(l) and Ir\u2032 .I\u03b1\u2032 .Il\u2032 =\nI(r\u2032 )rn\u2032 \u2032 \u03b3n\u2032 \u2032 l\u2032n\u2032 I(l\u2032 ) . . . I(r\u2032 )r1\u2032 \u03b31\u2032 l\u20321 I(l\u2032 ) are both decompositions into totally indecomposables of the same 2cell in HG, and so must agree. Thus n = n\u2032 and \u03b3i = \u03b3i\u2032 for each i, while also I(r)ri = I(r\u2032 )ri\u2032 and\nli I(l) = l\u2032i I(l\u2032 ) for each i.\nSince I(r)ri = I(r\u2032 )ri\u2032 , either there is a 1-cell s such that I(r) = I(r\u2032 )s and sri = ri\u2032 , or there is a 1-cell\ns such that I(r\u2032 ) = I(r)s and sri\u2032 = ri . Without loss of generality we take the former. Applying R we get\nr\u2032 = rR(s), and now\n\u03b1\u2032 = RI\u03b1\u2032\n= R(\u03b2n\u2032 ) . . . R(\u03b21\u2032 )\n= R(rn\u2032 \u03b3n l\u2032n ) . . . R(r1\u2032 \u03b31\u2032 l\u20321 )\n= R(srn \u03b3n l\u2032n ) . . . R(sr1 \u03b31 l\u20321 )\n\u0001\n= Rs. R(rn \u03b3n l\u2032n ) . . . R(r1 \u03b31 l\u20321 )\nbut \u03b1\u2032 was assumed totally indecomposable, and so Rs must be an identity, r = r\u2032 .\nA similar argument shows that l = l\u2032 . Now\nIr.I\u03b1.Il = Ir\u2032 .I\u03b1\u2032 .Il\u2032\nin HG, with r = r\u2032 and l = l\u2032 , and so I\u03b1 = I\u03b1\u2032 since HG is free, and finally \u03b1 = \u03b1\u2032 .\n\n21\n\n\u0003\n\n\f9\n\nCofibrations\n\nThe first step of our analysis of cofibrations in Gray-Cat is to reduce the problem to one about sesquicategories. To this end, we define a sesquifunctor F : A \u2192 B to be a surjection if it is surjective on objects\nand on each hom F : A (A, B) \u2192 B(F A, F B) it is a surjective equivalence (a trivial fibration in Cat).\nWe also define a sesquicategory C to be projective if the function SesquiCat(C , F ) : SesquiCat(C , A ) \u2192\nSesquiCat(C , B) is surjective for all surjective sesquifunctor F : A \u2192 B.\nThe next result is a direct analogue of [12, Lemma 4.1].\nProposition 9.1 A Gray-functor F : A \u2192 B is a cofibration if and only if its underlying sesquifunctor\nU\u2217 F : U\u2217 A \u2192 U\u2217 B has the left lifting property with respect to surjective sesquifunctors. In particular, a\nGray-category A is cofibrant if and only its underlying sesquicategory U\u2217 A is projective (with respect to the\nsurjective sesquifunctors).\nProof: If P : C \u2192 D is a surjective sesquifunctor then C\u2217 P : C\u2217 C \u2192 C\u2217 D is a trivial fibration of Graycategories. If F is a cofibration then it will have the left lifting property with respect to C\u2217 P , and so U\u2217 F\nwill have the left lifting property with respect to P .\nThis proves one direction; for the other, suppose that U\u2217 F does have the left lifting property with respect\nto surjective sesquifunctors. This time, let P : C \u2192 D be a trivial fibration of Gray-categories. Then U\u2217 P\nis clearly surjective, and so U\u2217 F has the left lifting property with respect to U\u2217 P ; but this now means\nthat LU\u2217 F has the left lifting property with respect to P . If now X and Y are Gray-functors satisfying\nP X = Y F we have the following diagram of Gray-functors\nLU\u2217 A\n\nI\n\nLU\u2217 F\n\n/A\n\nX\n\nP\n\nF\n\n\u000f\n\nLU\u2217 B\n\nJ\n\n\u000f\n/B\n\n/C\n\nY\n\n\u000f\n/D\n\nin which I and J denote the canonical inclusions (components of the counit of L \u22a3 U\u2217 ). Since LU\u2217 F\nhas the left lifting property with respect to P , there is a Gray-functor Z : LU\u2217 B \u2192 C whose composite\nwith LU\u2217 F is XI and whose composite with P is Y J. Now J is bijective on objects, 1-cells, and 2-cells;\nwhile P is locally locally fully faithful (bijective on 3-cells with given domains and codomains), and so\nthere is a unique induced W : B \u2192 C with P W = Y and W J = Z. Finally P W F = Y F = P X and\nW F I = W J.LU\u2217 F = Z.LU\u2217 F = XI, while I is bijective on objects, 1-cells, and 2-cells, and P is locally\nlocally fully faithful, and so W F = X. Thus X provides the desired fill-in satisfying W F = X and P W = Y .\n\u0003\nFor a sesquicategory A , the counit HV A \u2192 A is bijective on objects, and surjective on 1-cells. Given\n1-cells f, g : x \u2192 y (paths in the 1-cells of A ), a 2-cell in A between their composites is included in HV A\nas one of the generating 2-cells. Thus the counit E : HV A \u2192 A is also full on 2-cells and we have:\nProposition 9.2 For each sesquicategory A , the counit map HV A \u2192 A is a surjective sesquifunctor. \u0003\nWe now find ourselves in the typical situation where projectives are the retracts of frees.\nProposition 9.3 For a sesquicategory A the following are equivalent:\n(i) A is projective;\n(ii) there is a sesquifunctor J : A \u2192 HV A with EJ = 1;\n(iii) A is a retract of a free sesquicategory HG on some computad G.\n(iv) A is free;\n\n22\n\n\fProof: The implication (i) \u21d2 (ii) follows immediately from the fact that E is a surjection of sesquicategories; the implication (ii) \u21d2 (iii) is trivial, and the implication (iii) \u21d2 (iv) is Proposition 8.1. For the\nimplication (iv) \u21d2 (i) we must show that any free sesquicategory HG is projective. But to say that HG is\nprojective with respect to a surjective sesquifunctor P : A \u2192 B is equivalent to saying that G is projective\nwith respect to the underlying computad morphism V P : V A \u2192 V B. But for a surjective sesquifunctor\nP : A \u2192 B, clearly V P : V A \u2192 V B has a section, and so any object G will be projective with respect to\nV P.\n\u0003\nCorollary 9.4 A Gray-category is cofibrant if and only if its underlying sesquicategory is free on a computad.\n\u0003\nWe can now give a very explicit description of a cofibrant replacement functor. For a Gray-category\nA, first forget the 3-cells, to obtain a sesquicategory U\u2217 A, then form the free sesquicategory HV U\u2217 A on\nits underlying computad, and then the free Gray-category LHV U\u2217 A on that. This has a canonical Grayfunctor E \u2032 : LHV U\u2217 A \u2192 A to the original Gray-category; in fact this is the counit at A of an adjunction\nbetween Gray-categories and computads. This Gray-functor E \u2032 is bijective on objects, surjective on 1-cells,\nand full on 2-cells. Factorize it as\ni\n/ QA q / A\nLHV U\u2217 A\nwhere i is bijective on objects, 1-cells, and 2-cells, and q is fully faithful on 3-cells. Clearly this defines a\nfunctor Q : Gray-Cat \u2192 Gray-Cat and a natural transformation q : Q \u2192 1.\nSince i is bijective on objects, 1-cells, and 2-cells, and the underlying sesquicategory of LHV U\u2217 A is just\nthe free sesquicategory HV U\u2217 A; the underlying sesquicategory of QA is also just HV U\u2217 A, so QA is indeed\na cofibrant Gray-category. Furthermore, since E \u2032 is bijective on objects, surjective on 1-cells, and full on\n2-cells, so is q; since q is also fully faithful on 3-cells, it is in fact a trivial fibration of Gray-categories.\nBut in fact we can do a bit better: Q is actually a comonad, so we can obtain a category of \"weak\"\nmorphisms of Gray-categories by taking the Kleisli category. This turns out to be a special case of a general\nconstruction due to Garner [3].\nWe already have the counit q : Q \u2192 1; next we build the comultiplication d : Q \u2192 Q2 . To do this,\nwrite W : Gray-Cat \u2192 Cmptd for the composite of U\u2217 : Gray-Cat \u2192 SesquiCat and V : SesquiCat \u2192\nCmptd, and K for the left adjoint HV ; with unit \u03b7 : 1 \u2192 V K and counit \u01eb : KV \u2192 1. Observe that the\nexterior of\nF U AI\nr\nII\nF \u03b7UA rrr\nII1\nr\nII\nr\nr\nII\nr\nr\n$\nyr\n/ FUA\nFUFUA\n\u01ebF UA\nF UiA\n\niA\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n/ QA\nF U QAK\n;\nKK\nvv\nKK\nvv\nKK\nv\nvv\niQA KK\n%\nvv qQA\nQQA\n\u01ebQA\n\ncommutes, and that iA is bijective on objects, 1-cells, and 2-cells, while qQA is fully faithful on 3-cells. Thus\n\n23\n\n\fthere is a unique Gray-functor d : QA \u2192 Q2 A making the diagram\niA\n\n/ QA\n\u000f\u000f\nF \u03b7UA\n\u000f\u000f \u000f\n\u000f\n\u000f\nFUFUA\n\u000f\u000f \u000f\n\u000f\ndA \u000f\u000f\nF UiA\n1\n\u000f\n\u000f\n\u000f\u000f \u000f\nF U QA \u000f\n\u000f\n\u000f\u000f \u000f\niQA\n\u000f \u0007\u000f\u000f\n\u000f\n2\nQ A qQA / QA\nFUA\n\ncommute. These dA are the components of a natural transformation d : Q \u2192 Q2 ; naturality of d is inherited\nfrom that of \u03b7, \u01eb, i, and q. One of the counit laws qQ.d = 1 holds by definition of d. We prove the other law\nQq.d = 1, by checking that the composite of each side with i agrees (so that Qq.d and 1 agree on objects,\n1-cells, and 2-cells), and that the composite of each side with q agrees (so that the two sides agree on 3-cells).\nThe calculations are:\nq.Qq.d = q.qQ.d\n= q.1\nQq.d.i = Qq.iQ.F U i.F \u03b7U\n= i.F uq.F U i.F \u03b7U\n= i.F U \u01eb.F \u03b7U\n=i\n= 1.i\nand so Qq.d = 1. We prove the coassociative law Qd.d = dQ.d using the same technique:\nqQ2 .Qd.d = d.qQ.d\n=d\n= qQ2 .dQ.d\nQd.d.i = Qd.iQ.F U i.F \u03b7U\n= iQ2 .F U d.F U i.F \u03b7U\n= iQ2 .F U iQ.F U F U i.F U F \u03b7U.F \u03b7U\n= iQ2 .F U iQ.F \u03b7U Q.F U i.F \u03b7U\n= dQ.iQ.F U i.F \u03b7U\n= dQ.d.i\nand so Qd.d = dQ.d.\nWe have now proved:\nTheorem 9.5 There is a comonad (Q, q, d) on Gray-Cat for which qA : QA \u2192 A is a cofibrant replacement\nof A for every Gray-category A.\nAs mentioned above, this comonad can be obtained using the results of [3], which provide a general\ntechnique for defining weak morphisms of higher categories via Kleisli categories for comonads.\n\n24\n\n\fReferences\n[1] Clemens Berger.
