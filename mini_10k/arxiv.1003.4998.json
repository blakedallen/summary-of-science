INTRODUCTION\n\nUltracompact (UC) H ii regions have radii R < 0.1 pc\nand high radio surface brightness (Churchwell 2002).\nThey have a characteristic distribution of morphologies\n(Wood & Churchwell 1989; Kurtz et al. 1994), and usually are found associated with one another and with\ncompact H ii regions (e.g. Welch et al. 1987; Gaume &\nClaussen 1990; Mehringer et al. 1993; Kim & Koo 2001).\nTheir spectral energy distributions (SEDs) can reflect a\ntransition from optically thin to optically thick emission,\nbut often show an anomalous intermediate wavelength\ndependence (Franco et al. 2000; Lizano 2008). Recent\nradio continuum observations have suggested that ultracompact H ii regions can contract, change in shape, or expand anisotropically over intervals of as little as \u223c 10 yr\n(Franco-Hern\u00e1ndez & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez 2004; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al.\n2007; Galv\u00e1n-Madrid et al. 2008).\nThe observed brightness and size of UC H ii regions\nrequire that they be ionized by massive stars of spectral\ntype earlier than B3. If the regions were to expand at\nthe sound speed of ionized gas, ci \u223c 10 km/s, they would\nhave lifetimes of roughly 104 yr. Less than 1% of an OB\nstar's lifetime of a few million years should therefore be\nthomas.peters@ita.uni-heidelberg.de\n1 Zentrum f\u00fcr Astronomie der Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg, Institut\nf\u00fcr Theoretische Astrophysik, Albert-Ueberle-Str. 2, D-69120\nHeidelberg, Germany\n2 Fellow of the Landesstiftung Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\n3 Department of Astrophysics, American Museum of Natural\nHistory, 79th Street at Central Park West, New York, New York\n10024-5192, USA\n4 Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology,\nStanford University, Menlo Park, CA 94025, U.S.A.\n5 Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie, K\u00f6nigstuhl 17, D69117 Heidelberg, Germany\n\nspent within such a region, so the same fraction of OB\nstars should now lie within them. However, surveys find\nnumbers in our Galaxy consistent with over 10% of OB\nstars being surrounded by them (Wood & Churchwell\n1989; De Pree et al. 2005), or equivalently, lifetimes of\n\u223c 105 yr if this model is correct.\nA number of explanations have been proposed for this\nlifetime problem, including confinement in cloud cores\nby thermal pressure (De Pree et al. 1995; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura\n& Franco 1996) or turbulent pressure (Xie et al. 1996),\nram pressure confinement by infall (Yorke 1986; Hollenbach et al. 1994) or bow shocks (Van Buren et al. 1990;\nMac Low et al. 1991a; Arthur & Hoare 2006), champagne\nflows (Bodenheimer et al. 1979; Garc\u0131\u0301a-Segura & Franco\n1996; Arthur & Hoare 2006), disk evaporation (Hollenbach et al. 1994), and mass-loaded stellar winds (Dyson\net al. 1995; Redman et al. 1996; Williams et al. 1996;\nLizano et al. 1996), but most have been argued to have\nmajor flaws (Mac Low et al. 2007).\nWe have modeled accretion on to an ionizing source\nusing three-dimensional simulations (Peters et al. 2010,\nhereafter Paper I). These calculations suggest that accretion can indeed explain the lifetime problem, but in an\nunexpected way. Keto (2002, 2007) has argued that ultracompact and hypercompact H ii regions are simply the\nionized portion of an accretion flow. However, massive\nstars require accretion at rates exceeding 10\u22124 M yr\u22121\n(Beuther et al. 2002; Beltr\u00e1n et al. 2006) to reach their\nfinal masses before exhausting their nuclear fuel (Keto\n& Wood 2006). The result is gravitational instability\nduring collapse, leading to the formation of dense gas filaments in the rotating, collapsing flow, along with dozens\nof accompanying stars (Paper I). The strongest sources\nof ionizing radiation orbit through the dense filaments\n\n\f2\nrepeatedly, accreting mass efficiently when they do. The\nfilaments absorb the ionizing radiation locally, though,\nwhen this happens, shielding the rest of the H ii region\nfor long enough for it to recombine. As a result, the size\nof the observed H ii region remains independent of the\nage of the ionizing star until the surrounding secondary\nstar formation cuts off accretion on to the primary and\na compact H ii region begins to grow around it.\nIn this paper we consider in more detail than in Paper I whether our models of ionization interacting with a\ngravitationally unstable accretion flow can reproduce the\nobservations of ultracompact H ii regions summarized at\nthe beginning of this section. We show how H ii regions fluctuate in size as their central stars pass through\ndensity fluctuations, and demonstrate that our models\nqualitatively reproduce all morphologies observed for ultracompact H ii regions, even giving general quantitative\nagreement with the distribution of different morphologies observed by Wood & Churchwell (1989) and Kurtz\net al. (1994). Our models also offer a natural explanation\nfor the observed clustering of ultracompact H ii regions.\nWe further demonstrate that they reproduce observed\nSEDs, and provide natural explanations for the anomalous SEDs observed for some ultracompact H ii regions\n(Lizano 2008; Beuther et al. 2004; Keto et al. 2008).\nIn Sect. 2 we describe our methods for modeling ultracompact H ii regions and simulating observations, while\nin Sect. 3 we describe the results of our work relevant for\nthis paper. Finally, in Sect. 4 we draw conclusions.\n2.1. Simulations\nWe present three-dimensional, gas dynamic, simulations with radiation feedback from ionizing and nonionizing radiation. We use the FLASH adaptive-mesh\ncode (Fryxell et al. 2000), modified to include a hybridcharacteristics raytracing method (Rijkhorst et al. 2006)\nto solve the radiative transfer problem. The protostars\nare modeled by sink particles (Federrath et al. 2010) that\nare coupled to the radiation module via a protostellar\nmodel (Paper I).\nWe simulate the collapse of a massive core with a mass\nof 1000 M . The core has constant density within the\nsphere with r < 0.5 pc, while further out the density falls\noff as r\u22123/2 . The gas temperature is initially T = 30 K.\nThe core begins in solid body rotation with a ratio of\nrotational to gravitational energy \u03b2 = 0.05.\nWe use an adaptive mesh with a cell size at the highest\nrefinement level of 98 AU. Sink particles are inserted at\na cut-off density of \u03c1crit = 7 \u00d7 10\u221216 g cm\u22123 and accrete\nall gas above \u03c1crit within an accretion radius of rsink =\n590 AU if it is gravitationally bound to the particle.\nWe analyze two simulations. In the first simulation\n(run A), we only follow the evolution of a single star and\nsuppress the formation of any secondary stars. We do\nthis by introducing a dynamical temperature floor\n\nG\u03bc\n\u03c1(n\u2206x)2\n\u03c0kB\n\n2.2. Generation of Free-Free Emission Maps\n\nRadio continuum emission from H ii regions around\nmassive stars at wavelengths \u03bb \u2265 0.3 cm (\u03bd \u2264 1011 Hz) is\npredominantly caused by free-free emission from ionized\nhydrogen (Gordon & Sorochenko 2002). Since scattering\ncan be neglected for this problem (Kraus 1966; Gordon &\nSorochenko 2002), the equation of radiative transfer can\nbe readily integrated. First, we calculate the free-free\nabsorption coefficient of atomic hydrogen\n\u0010 n\n\u00112 \u0012 T \u0013\u22121.35 \u0010 \u03bd \u0011\u22122.1\ne\ne\n\u03b1\u03bd = 0.212\ncm\u22121 ,\n1 cm\u22123\n1K\n1 Hz\n(2)\nwith number density of free electrons ne , electron temperature Te and frequency \u03bd. Since the electrons thermalize quickly (Dyson & Williams 1980), we can take\nthe gas temperature T = Te . Given the absorption coefficient, the optical depth at distance r from the edge of\nthe domain is then\nZ r\n\u03c4\u03bd =\n\u03b1\u03bd ds.\n(3)\n0\n\n2. NUMERICAL METHOD\n\nTmin =\n\nset n \u2265 4 to prevent artificial fragmentation (Truelove\net al. 1997). In the second simulation (run B), we do not\napply the temperature floor, instead allowing the formation of secondary sink particles.\nMore details on the simulation method as well as a detailed description of the simulation results can be found\nin Paper I.\n\n(1)\n\nwith Newton's constant G, mean molecular weight \u03bc,\nBoltzmann's constant kB , local gas density \u03c1, and cell\nsize \u2206x. This temperature floor guarantees that the\nJeans length is always resolved with n cells. We must\n\nThe radiative transfer equation in the Rayleigh-Jeans\nlimit then leads to the brightness temperature\nZ \u03c4\u03bd\n0\nT (\u03c4\u03bd ) = e\u2212\u03c4\u03bd\ne\u03c4\u03bd T (\u03c4\u03bd0 ) d\u03c4\u03bd0 .\n(4)\n0\n\nThe resulting map of brightness temperatures can be\nconverted to flux densities with the solid angle subtended\nby the beam \u03a9S of the telescope via\n2kB T\n\u03a9S .\n(5)\n\u03bb2\nFollowing the algorithm described in Mac Low et al.\n(1991b), we convolve the resulting image with the beam\nwidth and add some noise according to the telescope\nparameters. The parameters for the Very Large Array\n(VLA)6 are given in Table 1, and the parameters for the\nAtacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)7 are given in\nTable 2. We model the synthetic observation using an\neffective Gaussian beam rather than doing a full-fledged\nsimulation of aperture synthesis.\nF\u03bb =\n\n2.3.

First, to compute the dust temperature selfconsistently, using the standard Monte Carlo method of\nBjorkman & Wood (2001), combined with Lucy's method\nof treating optically thin regions (Lucy 1999). Second, to\ncompute the images of the free-free and dust continuum\nemission by using it as a volume-rendering ray-tracer\ntool. RADMC-3D is the successor of the RADMC code\n(Dullemond & Dominik 2004) which has been used in\nnumerous papers.\nRADMC-3D has been tested against the earlier 2D\nversion of RADMC for various 1D and 2D test cases.\nA detailed discussion of RADMC-3D will be published\nseparately, but since this is the first scientific use of\nthe code, we show the results of a simple test case\nhere. It involves a simple 1D spherically symmetric envelope around a star. The density of the envelope is\n\u03c1dust (r) = \u03c10 (r/1AU)\u22122 , where \u03c10 takes the values 10\u221215\ng cm\u22123 for test case 1 and 10\u221214 g cm\u22123 for test case\n2. The inner radius lies at 5 AU, the outer radius at\n100 AU. The star has solar parameters, but we treat the\nstellar spectrum as a blackbody of T = 5780 K. For the\nopacity we use silicate dust spheres of 0.1 \u03bcm, using optical constants of olivine from the Jena database9 , but\nwe artificially set the scattering opacity to zero in order\nto be able to compare our results to the results from a\nsimple 1D variable eddington factor dust radiative transfer code called TRANSPHERE10 . With RADMC-3D we\nnow compute the dust temperature using the Monte\nCarlo method. We do this in two ways. First, we use\na spherical 1D grid, similar to what we use for TRAN9\n\nhttp://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Laboratory/Database/jpdoc/\nhttp://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/dullemon/radtrans/\n\n10\n\nSPHERE. Secondly, we use a 3D Cartesian AMR-refined\ngrid, where the refinement is done with the criterion that\nthe cells with centers having radii r > 5 AU from the star\nshould have a size \u2206x \u2265 0.2r. This is a relatively coarse\nresolution, meant to test the effect of low resolution on\nthe results. The outcome of this comparison is displayed\nin Figure 1, showing the excellent agreement between the\ntemperature profiles.\n3. RESULTS\n\nOur simulations follow the gravitational collapse of the\ninitial massive clump and lead to the formation of highmass stars. The collapse leads to the formation of a\nmassive rotationally flattened structure, which is gravitationally unstable and fragments. Only a single star is\nallowed to form in run A. It accretes 72M in 145 kyr.\nIn run B, three high-mass stars with M \u2265 10M form\nwithin 70 kyr, and become the dominant source of ionizing radiation within the star cluster. The interaction\nof the ionizing radiation with the infalling accretion flow\nleads to multiple effects observable in both spatial and\nspectral diagnostics.\n3.1. Time Evolution\n\nThe most striking property of the resulting H ii regions\nis their extremely high variability in time and shape. In\nthe online material of Paper I we presented movies of radio continuum maps from different viewpoints. The radio maps were generated for VLA parameters at a wavelength of \u03bb = 2 cm, using a beam with full width at half\nmaximum of 0.00 14 and a noise level of 10\u22123 Jy. The assumed distance was 2.65 kpc. All the movies show the\ncontinuous build-up and destruction of UC H ii regions.\nThe timescale for changes of more than 5000 AU in size\ncan be as short as 100 yr.\nThis flickering is caused by the accretion flow in which\nthe sources are embedded. When the protostar passes\n\n\f4\n400\n\nRADMC-3D: 1D spherical\nTRANSPHERE\nRADMC-3D: 3D AMR\n\nT (K)\n\n300\n200\n100\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n400\n\n60\n80\nR (AU)\n\n100\n\n120\n\nRADMC-3D: 1D spherical\nTRANSPHERE\nRADMC-3D: 3D AMR\n\n300\nT (K)\n\n40\n\n200\n100\n0\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n80\nR (AU)\n\n100\n\n120\n\nFig. 1.- Temperature profiles for two different core densities,\n\u03c10 = 10\u221215 g cm\u22123 (left), \u03c10 = 10\u221214 g cm\u22123 (right), as generated by TRANSPHERE, RADMC-3D on a spherical 1D grid, and\nRADMC-3D on a 3D AMR grid. All profiles agree with each other.\n\nthrough dense, gravitationally unstable filaments in the\naccretion flow, they absorb its ionizing radiation, so\nthat the gas above the filament recombines and cools\ndown. Since the gravitational instabilities cause the accretion flow to be chaotic, the interplay between the radiation feedback and the infalling material results in highly\nstochastic ionization and recombination processes in the\nsurrounding gas.\nThis effect is demonstrated in Figure 2. It shows\ndramatic changes in the H ii region around the most\nmassive star in run B. Between t = 0.6592 Myr and\nt = 0.6595 Myr (within 300 yr), a region with a diameter\nof \u223c 6000 AU suddenly recombines. Changes like this not\nonly affect the physical size of the H ii region, but they\ncan also alter their morphology. From t = 0.6668 Myr\nto t = 0.6671 Myr (again within 300 yr), the morphology of the UC H ii region surrounding the most massive protostar changes from shell-like to core-halo because of a large-scale recombination event that clears\nthe rim of the shell. The shielding by the filaments also\ncontrols how ionizing radiation can escape perpendicular to the disk. For example, this reverses the cometary\nH ii region around the star between t = 0.6524 Myr and\nt = 0.6534 Myr (within 1000 yr). The three examples\ngiven in Figure 2 indicate that the morphology of ultracompact H ii regions around accreting massive protostars\ndepends sensitively on accretion events close to the protostar.\nThe flickering observed in the simulations also resolves\n\nthe long-standing lifetime problem for UC H ii regions\n(Wood & Churchwell 1989). Since UC H ii regions are\nnot freely expanding bubbles of gas that monotonically\nincrease in size, their diameter does not depend on their\nage. An extreme version of the discrepancy between protostellar mass and size of the H ii region occurs in run\nA, where the 70M protostar has almost no visible H ii\nregion. It is totally quenched by the strong accretion\nflow.\nWhile the source in run A never stops accreting, the\nmost massive stars in run B finally stop growing when the\ngas reservoir around them is fully exploited. As the density surrounding the most massive star then drops, the\nhot, ionized gas can finally expand monotonicially, eventually overrunning the second most massive star as well.\nOnce there is no more high-density gas in its neighborhood, the flickering around the most massive star stops.\nThe ionized gas continues to expand, forming a compact\nH ii region with larger size and fainter emission than the\npreceding ultracompact phase. We stress that it is not\nthe ionizing radiation that stops the accretion flow by\ndriving away the surrounding gas, rather it is the subsiding accretion flow that allows the ionized gas to expand.\nWe call this process fragmentation-induced starvation, a\nmore detailed discussion of which we presented in Paper\nI.\n3.2. Morphology\nThe extended H ii regions found in the simulations display a large amount of substructure. Equation (2) shows\nthat the emission from free-free transitions scales with\nthe square of the number density of free electrons, ne .\nThis explains the emission peak close to the protostar,\nwhere very dense gas in the accretion flow gets partially\nionized. However, not all emission peaks are associated\nwith stars.\nFigure 3 shows some examples. The upper left panel\n(a1 ) shows an H ii region with a shell-like structure. The\nshell clearly exhibits a peak on its rim that is several\n1000 AU away from any nearby star. The shell is created\nby dense shocks running through the H ii region, which\nare replenished by material from the accretion flow. The\nemission of this dense gas is what creates the shell. Another example is shown in the lower left panel (a2 ) of\nFigure 3. It shows a dense blob of gas that is externally\nirradiated by a massive star and creates a peak that appears to indicate the position of a second star. Obviously,\npeaks in emission maps are not an ideal guide to the coordinates of stars.\nThe aforementioned shocks contribute largely to the\nemission seen in the maps. The middle panels (b1 ) and\n(b2 ) in Figure 3 show an edge-on view of the rotationally flattened structure of the star cluster. The upper\npanel (b1 ) shows that the most massive star has created\na cometary H ii region. The lower panel (b2 ) displays\nthe same region 200 yr later. The ionizing radiation has\nblown away gas from the accretion flow close to the protostar. This shock runs away from the star and creates\na filament of strong emission across the H ii region. The\nright-hand plots (c1 ) and (c2 ) in Figure 3 show the same\nregion face-on. From this viewing angle, the shock shows\nup as shell-like structure. This demonstrates that the\nshell does not trace the edge where the ionizing radiation hits the accretion disk, but rather shocks generated\n\n\f5\n\n0.6595 Myr\n19.727 M\u2299\n\n(a1 ) 0.6668 Myr\nface-on\n20.204 M\u2299\n\n(a2 ) 0.6671 Myr\n+300 yr 20.253 M\u2299\n\n(b1 ) 0.6524 Myr\nface-on\n18.046 M\u2299\n\n(b2 ) 0.6534 Myr\n+300 yr 18.304 M\u2299\n\nbox size 0.122 pc\n\n(c1 )\nedge-on\n\n(c2 )\n+1000 yr\n\n40.00\n\nemission at 2 cm in mJy/beam\n\n0.6592 Myr\n19.692 M\u2299\n\n30.00\n\n20.00\n\n10.00\n\n0.00\n\nFig. 2.- Changes in the H ii region around the most massive protostar in run B. The images in the lower panels show the H ii region at\na slightly later time than the images in the upper panels. The left-hand panels (a1 ) and (a2 ) show the recombination of ionized gas with a\ndiameter of \u223c 6000 AU within 300 yr. The midway panels (b1 ) and (b2 ) demonstrate how the morphology of the H ii region changes from\nshell-like to core-halo in 300 yr. The right-hand panels (c1 ) and (c2 ) present the reversal of a cometary H ii region in 1000 yr. The box size\ndisplayed is 0.122 pc. Black dots and circles indicate the position of all protostars with their accretion radii in the image. The mass of the\ncentral protostar is indicated in the images. All maps are simulated VLA observations at 2 cm with an assumed distance to the star cluster\nof 2.65 kpc.\n\nfrom inflowing gas. The shell-like structures around accreting protostars can be interpreted as indirect evidence\nfor the accretion process.\nThe origin of the shell morphology changes when accretion ceases. Figure 4 shows the late-stage evolution of the\nstar cluster. The most massive star has stopped accreting, allowing its H ii region to begin to expand quickly\ninto the ambient gas. The left-hand plots and show the\nexpanding H ii region face-on in the upper panel (a1 )\nand edge-on in the lower panel (a2 ). Here, the strong\nshell-like emission clearly comes from the dense gas in\nthe rotationally flattened structure around the protostar\nrather than from a shock launched by the protostar.\nWhile the accretion onto the most massive star has\nstopped and cannot directly affect the structure of the\ngrowing H ii region any more, it can still be influenced by\nother stars that interact with the gas. Two such events\noccur in run B and are shown in Figure 4. The middle\npanels (b1 ) and (b2 ) show a time sequence of a 7.8M\nstar approaching the rim of the shell. Its ionizing radiation is strong enough to create sufficient thermal pressure\nto blow away the rim of the shell from its direct neighborhood. The right-hand panels (b3 ) and (b4 ) show the\nsame star 8200 yr later, when it has already entered the\ncompact H ii region. Now its ionizing radiation can freely\nexpand. The gravitational attraction of the star is strong\nenough to pull along a dense stream of gas. This stream\nallows the star to grow in mass although it has entered\nthe H ii region filled with underdense gas. This suggests\nthat deformed shells could be indicative of stars inside\nlarge-scale H ii regions.\n\n3.3. Dependence of Morphologies on Viewing Angles\n\nThe simulation data presented here offer the unique\nopportunity to look at the same H ii region from different viewing angles. We have already seen that the\nobserved morphology depends crucially on the position\nof the observer. We investigate this observation in detail\nfor some H ii regions appearing in run B.\nFigure 5 displays an H ii region around the most massive star in run B. The first panel (a1 ) shows the region face-on, and the successive panels show the region\nrotated around an axis in the plane of the rotationally\nflattened structure by 18\u25e6 increments until a rotation of\n90\u25e6 is reached. Hence, the last panel (a6 ) shows the region edge-on. This sequence of images demonstrates that\na region with a shell-like morphology from one viewing\nangle can have a cometary morphology from a different\nviewing angle.\nThe transition angle at which the shell-like morphology turns into a cometary morphology is about 72\u25e6 in\nthis particular case. The online material for this article\ncontains a movie of the volume-rendered (logarithmic)\nabsorption coefficient of this region along with the corresponding synthetic VLA image as the line of sight is\nrotating, illustrating the complex structure of the ionized gas in the H ii region, and how it determines the\nmorphology, depending on the viewing angle.\nBecause the ultracompact H ii region shape is asymmetric, we get a different result if we perform the rotation around a different axis. Figure 6 starts with the last\nframe (a6 ) of Figure 5 and successively rotates the region by 90\u25e6 around the polar axis.

The left-hand panels (a1 ) and (a2 ) give two examples of\nemission peaks that are not directly related to stars. This calls into question the usual understanding that coordinates of stars should be\ndirectly related to emission peaks. The middle panels (b1 ) and (b2 ) show an edge-on view of the star cluster with a cometary H ii region\naround the most massive star. Within 200 yr, a shock is launched at the protostar, runs through the H ii region and creates a filamentary\nstructure. The right-hand panels (c1 ) and (c2 ) show the situation face-on. Here, the shock looks like a shell expanding from the protostar.\nThis indicates that the appearance of H ii regions is closely related to accretion events close to the protostar. Black dots and circles indicate\nthe position of all protostars with their accretion radii in the image. The mass of the central protostar is indicated in the images. All maps\nare simulated VLA observations at 2 cm with an assumed distance to the star cluster of 2.65 kpc.\n\nview is edge-on for all times. At an angle around 36\u25e6 ,\nthe cometary region develops strong shell-like structures.\nWe already know that these filaments have their origin in\ngas blown away by the protostar. This region is of shelllike type since it is bounded by a dense filament. This\nmeans that shell-like regions can occur both at face-on\nand at edge-on view. In principle, the same holds true\nfor cometary regions. They can also be observed face-on\nwhen the ionizing radiation is shielded anisotropically.\nWe have repeated the same exercise for different H ii\nregions and find that the transition angle between shelllike and cometary morphologies shows no systematic behavior. Figure 7 shows two more rotations from faceon to edge-on. We show only the first and last images as well as the transition angle. The upper panels\n(a1 ) to (a3 ) show the transformation of a shell-like morphology into a cometary morphology at t = 0.6864 Myr,\nthe lower panels (b1 ) to (b3 ) show a similar transition\nat t = 0.6925 Myr. The central star has a mass of\n22.532M and 23.025M , respectively. The transition\nangle is about 36\u25e6 in the former and 54\u25e6 in the latter\ncase. They depend on the details of the structure. A\nuniversal angle above which transition occurs does not\nexist.\n3.4. Morphology Statistics\n3.4.1. Types\n\nMorphologies of UC H ii regions were classified by\nWood & Churchwell (1989) and Kurtz et al. (1994) as\nshell, cometary, core-halo, spherical, irregular and unresolved. De Pree et al. (2005) abandoned the core-halo\n\nmorphology and introduced a new bipolar category for\nelongated H ii regions. They argued for abandoning the\ncore-halo type because most H ii regions are surrounded\nby faint emission, which produces a halo around any H ii\nregion. Though this may be true, we find it useful to keep\nthis morphological type for regions with a pronounced\ncentral peak and a fainter envelope. The presence of a\npronounced envelope clearly distinguishes this morphology from the spherical type, which we also find.\nIn addition, we do not require shell-like regions to be\nvoid of central peaks. Although the larger, late-time\nshells do indeed not have central peaks, the UC H ii\nregions associated with accreting protostars do have central peaks because they ionize their own accretion flow.\nIn fact, observations with high sensitivity and resolution\ndo find centrally peaked shells that were previously classified as spherical (Carral et al. 2002). We predict that\nmore regions of this type will be found as observations\nwith better resolution and sensitivity also become available for more distant massive star forming regions.\nFigure 8 demonstrates the importance of resolution\nand sensitivity in identifying the correct morphology.\nThe figure shows synthetic maps of the same shell-like\nH ii region for VLA parameters at 2 cm, placed at different distances to the observer. The shell disappears\nbetween 6 and 10 kpc, where both the spatial resolution\nand the noise level make it impossible to distinguish between parts of the H ii region and pure noise. On the\nother hand, the number of centrally peaked shells seen in\nour simulations might be reduced by including additional\nfeedback processes like line-driven stellar winds or mag-\n\n\f7\n\n0.7197 Myr\n23.391 M\u2299\n\n(a1 ) 0.7293 Myr\nface-on\n7.808 M\u2299\n\n(a2 ) 0.7342 Myr\nedge-on 7.832 M\u2299\n\n(b1 ) 0.7424 Myr\n8.025 M\u2299\n\n(b2 ) 0.7448 Myr\n+4900 yr 8.056 M\u2299\n\n(b3 )\n+8200 yr\n\n(b4 )\n+2400 yr\n\n40.00\n\nemission at 2 cm in mJy/beam\n\n0.7197 Myr\n23.391 M\u2299\n\n30.00\n\n20.00\n\n10.00\n\n0.00\n\nbox size 0.122 pc\n\nFig. 4.- Compact H ii region created by the most massive protostar in run B. The left-hand panels show this region face-on in the\nupper panel (a1 ) and edge-on in the lower panel (a2 ). The emission in the shell has its origin in the rotationally flattened structure around\nthe protostar and not in a shock running through the H ii region. The middle and right-hand panels (b1 ) to (b4 ) show a time sequence\nof a second star interacting with the dense gas that bounds the region. In the middle panels (b1 ) and (b2 ), this star blows away a dense\nfilament by its own ionizing radiation. The right-hand panels (b3 ) and (b4 ) demonstrate what happens when it enters the low density\nregion. Its gravitational field pulls a dense stream of gas behind it. Broken-up shells could thus be a helpful observational signature to\nlocate stars inside H ii regions. Black dots and circles indicate the position of all protostars with their accretion radii in the image. The\nmass of the central protostar is indicated in the images.

All maps are simulated VLA observations at 2 cm with an assumed distance to the\nstar cluster of 2.65 kpc.\n\n\f9\nnetically driven outflows, which might be able to create a\ncavity around the protostar. If these processes would be\nstrong enough to thin out the dense accretion flow sufficiently to remove the peaks remains an open question.\nThe new bipolar type is not well defined. De Pree\net al. (2005) gave only one example for this new category, where the bipolar shape is not very distinctive.\nChurchwell (2002) required an hourglass shape for the\nbipolar morphology, which is not present in their example. Although we do find morphologies that look bipolar\nin the simulations, there are only very few of them, and\ntheir features are not very pronounced. The small number of bipolar regions is in agreement with observations\n(Churchwell 2002; De Pree et al. 2005). All of the bipolar regions could equally well fall into one of the other\nclasses, which is why we do not take this category into\naccount.\nThe sensitive dependence on viewing angle and the\nhigh time variability of the H ii region caused by the accretion flow is sufficient to produce morphologies of any\ndescribed type in a single simulation. Figure 9 shows\nmaps from run A with only one ionizing source. The\ndisplayed shell-like and core-halo morpholgies are faceon views, whereas the cometary H ii region is viewed\nedge-on. As discussed above, the same morphologies can\nequally well be obtained at different viewing angles. It\nis apparent that the size of the H ii region does not scale\nwith the mass of the protostar. On the contrary, the irregular region corresponds to the largest protostar, but\nit is among the smallest H ii regions.\n3.4.2. Comparison to Observations\n\nFor comparison with the observational surveys by\nWood & Churchwell (1989) and Kurtz et al. (1994), we\nperform a census of morphologies in run A and run B.\nWe select 25 snapshots from each simulation and view\neach one from 20 randomly chosen angles. This gives a\ntotal of 500 images per simulation. The different viewing\nangles take into account the fact that because of the axisymmetric geometry of the initial conditions, some morphologies preferentially occur at different orientations.\nFor example, shell-like morphologies are found mostly\nface-on, and cometary morphologies edge-on. The set\nof different viewing angles, uniformly distributed on the\nunit sphere around the center of the computational domain, avoids statistical biases by this effect. By the same\ntoken, the distribution of morphologies also changes with\ntime. Since many stars in run B reach a mass of 10 M\nby the end of the simulation, the later times contain more\nspherical and unresolved H ii regions than the beginning\nof the simulation. Since we do not know the geometry and the evolutionary stage of the UC H ii regions\nin the surveys, we assume randomly distributed orientations and ages and thus average over different viewing\nangles and simulation snapshots to get a representative\nsample. We note that this somewhat overstates the contribution from later stages in our simulations, since with\na standard IMF there are probably far more star forming events that terminate with the formation of low-mass\nOB stars than higher-mass ones. To achieve consistency\nwith the observational analysis techniques we use contour\nplots to identify the morphological classes and follow the\ndefinitions given in Wood & Churchwell (1989).\nTo guarantee that the viewing angles are distributed\n\nTABLE 3\nPercentage Frequency Distribution of Morphologies\nType\nWC89 K94 Run A Run B\nSpherical/Unresolved\n43\n55\n19\n60 \u00b1 5\nCometary\n20\n16\n7\n10 \u00b1 5\nCore-halo\n16\n9\n15\n4\u00b12\nShell-like\n4\n1\n3\n5\u00b11\nIrregular\n17\n19\n57\n21 \u00b1 5\nNote. - Percentage relative frequencies of UC H ii region morphologies in surveys and simulations. The table shows the morphology statistics of UC H ii regions in the surveys of Wood &\nChurchwell (1989) (WC89) and Kurtz et al. (1994) (K94) as well\nas from a random evolutionary sample from run A and run B of\n500 images for each simulation. For run B, the mean value and\nstandard deviation of the relative frequencies from independent\nevaluations by the first four co-authors are given. The statistics\nfor run A, in which only one massive star forms, disagree with the\nobservations.\n\nevenly on the sphere, we use a rejection method to calculate the random angles (Press et al. 1986). We start with\nthree random numbers x, y, z with a uniform distribution p\non the interval [\u22121, 1]. We then calculate the radius\nr = x2 + y 2 + z 2 and drop all points with r > 1. The\nremaining points are projected onto the sphere, X = x/r,\nY = y/r and Z = z/r. The Cartesian coordinates\n(X, Y, Z) of the point on the unit sphere are then converted into spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6), resulting in the\ndesired distribution of viewing angles.\nThe results of our statistical analysis are presented in\nTable 3. The numbers from run B are taken from evaluations performed independently by the first four authors,\nso that we can give mean values and standard deviations\nfor the relative frequencies. The standard deviations remained small in absolute terms, never exceeding five percentage points, although some are large in relative terms,\nparticularly for the rarer types.\nGiven the variation amongst the observational surveys,\nthe results from the multiple sink simulation run B are\nquite consistent with the observational numbers. In particular, we find that roughly half of the sample represents spherical or unresolved UC H ii regions, in agreement with the classical lifetime problem. Conversely, the\nresults show that the relative numbers of spherical and\nunresolved H ii regions in run A disagree by more than\n20 percentage points with the observational findings.\nThis result clearly disagrees with theoretical models in\nwhich massive stars form alone. Since the protostar in\nrun A grows very quickly, it cannot generate such a large\nnumber of strongly confined H ii regions. Instead, lots\nof irregular H ii regions form. The only way to get a\nlarge number of spherical and unresolved H ii regions is\nthe formation of a stellar cluster. This again shows that\nrun B is a much more realistic model for massive star\nformation.\n3.5. Emission and Optical Depth\n\nIt is interesting to study the appearance of H ii regions\nat different wavelengths. Since the optical depth of the\nfree-free radiation calculated from the simulation data\nis exactly known, we can investigate how morphological\nfeatures of H ii regions depend on the optical depth. As\nan example, we examine in detail the H ii region from the\nupper panels (a1 ) to (a3 ) of Figure 7 at t = 0.6864 Myr\naround a 22.532M star in run B.\n\n\f10\n\n10.0 kpc\n\n(a1 ) 4.0 kpc\n\n(a4 ) 12.0 kpc\n\n(a2 ) 6.0 kpc\n\n(a5 ) 15.0 kpc\n\n(a3 )\n\n(a6 )\n\n40.00\n\nemission at 2 cm in mJy/beam\n\n2.65 kpc\n\n30.00\n\n20.00\n\n10.00\n\n0.00\n\nbox size 0.122 pc\n\nFig. 8.- Shell-like H ii region of run B with a central peak placed at different distances to the observer.

All morphologies found\nin surveys are present, depending on the simulation time and the viewing angle. The lower right panel demonstrates the problem with the\nbipolar category. The region is clearly elongated, but it also shows a shell-like structure. Since elongation alone seems to be insufficient to\ndefine a category on its own, we do not consider bipolar regions as a separate category. All maps are simulated VLA observations at 2 cm\nwith an assumed distance to the star cluster of 2.65 kpc.\n\n\f11\nFigure 10 shows synthetic VLA observations for wavelengths from 20 cm to 0.7 cm assuming a distance of\n2.65 kpc (see Tab. 1). The beam width decreases with\nwavelength, so that the H ii region is increasingly better resolved. The corresponding images of optical depth\nare shown in Figure 11. In agreement with the expected\nbehavior evident from Equation (2), the optical depth\ndecreases with decreasing wavelength. The broad peak\nat 20 cm appears not only because of the large beam, but\nalso because the whole H ii region is optically thick. At\n6 cm, only the right-hand side of the H ii region is optically thick, as is clearly visible in the VLA observation.\nAt 3.6 cm, only a small region around the protostar and\nin an arc-like feature is optically thick, which leads to a\nshell-like H ii region. The VLA maps at 3.6 and 2 cm\nlook similar, but at the smaller wavelength the shell is\nnot optically thick anymore. The one-to-one correspondence between emission features and optically thick regions breaks at 2 cm. For 1.3 and 0.7 cm, the optically\nthick region around the protostar disappears. The shell\nis still visible at these wavelengths.\n3.6. Millimeter and Submillimeter Maps\nAt millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths one generally expects to observe dust emission along with the\nfree-free emission. This is not the case for the rather low\nmass core in the model presented here. Since the total\ninitial gas mass in our model is only 1000 M , there is\nless than 10 M of dust in the whole domain during the\nsimulation, under the assumption of a canonical gas-todust ratio of 100. This is not enough to produce any\nobservable emission, because the free-free radiation is\nmuch stronger. Hence, the simulated ALMA maps of\nthis model show only free-free emission, but not dust.\nWe can estimate the maximum flux due to dust emission as follows. Let Mdust be the total dust mass, d the\ndistance to the source, \u03ba\u03bd the dust opacity and B\u03bd (T )\nthe black-body spectrum for the temperature T . Then\nthe total flux from all dust is approximately\n1\nF\u03bd = 2 Mdust \u03ba\u03bd B\u03bd (T ).\n(6)\nd\nTo arrive at an estimate for the upper limit of F\u03bd , we\nset d = 2.65 kpc, Mdust = 10 M , T = 1000 K and\n\u03ba\u03bd = 8 \u00d7 10\u22122 cm2 g\u22121 at \u03bd = 187 GHz (\u03bb = 1.6 mm).\nThis yields F\u03bd \u2248 25.5 Jy or, assuming an UC H ii region with 0.03 pc diameter, 1.8 mJy/beam for an effective beam width of 0.018 arcsec. This is only a factor\nof 4 larger than the noise level for a 10 min integration time of this ALMA band (see Table 2), which is\n0.41 mJy. Though this calculation demonstrates that the\nsmall amount of dust in our simulation would already be\nvery faint when free-free emission was absent, what really\nmakes the dust emission invisible is its weakness compared to free-free emission (see also Section 3.7), which\nis independent of the telescope sensitivity.\nWe caution, however, that the above calculation assumes a homogeneous distribution of dust across the H ii\nregion. This treatment neglects dust emission from an\naccretion disk around the massive star, which we cannot\nresolve in our simulation and may produce significant\ndust emission. In our numerical example, ALMA would\nbe able to resolve these disks, if they exist, and detect\ntheir dust emission. A similar argument holds for disks\n\naround low-mass stars that are being exposed to ionizing\nradiation from a neighboring high-mass star, which may\nlife long enough to be observed (Hollenbach et al. 1994;\nRichling & Yorke 1998). This caveat also applies to the\nspectral energy distributions in the submillimeter regime\n(see Section 3.7).\nWe demonstrate the absence of dust emission in Figure 12 with the H ii region shown in Figure 10. The\nbright shell that was visible at VLA wavelengths completely disappears as the wavelength gets shorter. Instead, bright spots directly at the location of the massive\nstars appear. This emission is caused by partially ionized, dense gas of the accretion flow around these massive\nstars. None of the images shows any appreciable dust\nemission.\n3.7. Spectral Energy Distributions\nA useful diagnostic of UC H ii regions is their integrated SED. For a medium at constant temperature, the\nintegral in Equation (4) for the brightness temperature\nleads to\nT (\u03c4\u03bd ) = T (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c4\u03bd ).\n(7)\n\nIn the frequency regime where the emission is dominated\nby free-free, Equations (2) and (5) show that the flux\nF\u03bd of a homogeneous source typically grows as \u03bd 2 in the\noptically thick regime (small frequencies) and falls off\nlike \u03bd \u22120.1 in the optically thin regime (large frequencies).\nFor typical emission measures of EM = 108 pc cm\u22126 , the\ntransition frequency for which \u03c4 = 1 is \u03bdt \u2248 5.3 GHz.\nThis turnover frequency depends only weakly on the\nemission measure, \u03bdt \u221d EM0.48 .\nHowever, many observed SEDs of H ii regions do not\nbehave in this simple manner but show anomalous scaling\nexponents (Lizano 2008). In particular, there are SEDs\nthat grow linearly with \u03bd over a frequency interval that\ncan be as large as the whole VLA range (see Table 1).\nSuch anomalous scaling exponents can be reproduced by\nH ii region models with ionized gradients (Panagia &\nFelli 1975; Olnon 1975; Franco et al. 2000; Avalos et al.\n2006; Keto et al. 2008), hierarchical clumps (Ignace &\nChurchwell 2004) and additional dust emission (Rudolph\net al. 1990; Pratap et al. 1992; Beuther et al. 2004; Keto\net al. 2008).\nThe data from our numerical simulations is certainly\nmore realistic than the simple ionized gradient or hierarchical clump models. Therefore it is reassuring that\nwe can reproduce the typical shapes of observed SEDs.\nWe show two examples in Figure 13. The left-hand SED\nshows the full coverage from VLA over ALMA to IRAS\nfrequencies for the H ii region of Figures 10 and 12. The\nSEDs show the typical shape of those reported in Wood\n& Churchwell (1989). As already noted above, the freefree radiation is by far dominant up to ALMA frequencies. For IRAS frequencies, however, dust emission is the\ndominant process. The right-hand SED shows another\nexample that more nicely illustrates the typical scaling\nbehavior expected for the free-free emission. The dotted\nlines grow \u221d \u03bd 2 , the dashed lines fall off \u221d \u03bd \u22120.1 .\nOne example of an SED with an anomalous scaling\n\u221d \u03bd 1 (solid line) is shown in Figure 14. The result can\nbe a combined effect of density gradients in the ionized\ngas as well as shadowing by clumps, just as in the simpler analytical models.

The agreement of the freefree emission with the expected power laws is different for the two\nregions. Dust emission is visible only in the IRAS range. Missing\ncrosses representing dust emission are below the flux range shown\nin the image. The assumed distance for both SEDs is 2.65 kpc.\n\nduce anomalous exponents, and in fact in our particular\nmodel, the dust emission is so low that it is unable to\nproduce such gradients. Hence, our simulations reproduce both the general shape of H ii regions SEDs as well\nas the observed anomalous scaling behavior entirely with\nthe computed distribution of ionized gas.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented synthetic continuum observations\nof the H ii regions formed in our collapse simulations\nof massive star formation described in Paper I. We find\nthat the H ii regions are highly variable in size and shape\nas long as the massive star continues accreting. Dense\nfilaments in the gravitationally unstable accretion flow\nirregularly shield ionizing radiation from the central star.\nThis shielding effect leads to a large-scale (\u223c 5000 AU)\nflickering of the H ii regions on timescales as short as\n\u223c 100 yr. As long as the flickering continues, there is no\ndirect relation between the age of the star and the size of\nthe H ii region. This result appears able to resolve the\nUC H ii lifetime problem.\nFurthermore, we have identified the structures inside\nthe H ii regions that produce the continuum emission.\nWe find that emission peaks are not necesarily related\nto the positions of stars. Instead, strong emission is produced by partially ionized gas from the accretion flow\nthat enters the H ii region. These filaments can be ion-\n\nized and blown away by thermal pressure. Since the continuum emission is determined solely by the structure of\nthe flow field around the massive star, the appearance of\nthe H ii region depends strongly on the angle from which\nit is viewed. For example, we find that the same H ii region can be classified as shell-like or cometary, depending\non the position of the observer.\nWe have evaluated the distribution of apparent H ii region morphologies. The multiple sink simulation run B\nreproduces the observed relative frequencies reported\nfrom surveys, including the high fraction of spherical or\nunresolved regions. The single sink simulation run A,\nhowever, fails to reproduce the morphology statistics.\nThis is because the single star grows so quickly that it\nis statistically unable to produce a significant fraction\nof the smallest H ii regions. The formation of a whole\nstellar cluster is necessary to get the relative frequencies\nof the smallest H ii regions right. This analysis provides\nstrong evidence against models of massive star formation\nwhere all or most high-mass stars form in isolation.\nIn addition to the H ii region morphologies, we can also\nreproduce the different SEDs characteristic of UC H ii regions. We find that our initial gas mass of 1000 M is\ntoo small to produce observable dust emission at VLA\nor ALMA wavelengths. Nevertheless, ultracompact H ii\nregions at different times and places in our models show\nSEDs with both regular transitions from optically thick\nto optically thin spectral slopes as well as anomalous\nscaling with a spectral slope around unity. These slopes\nare entirely produced by inhomogeneities in the density\nstructure, with no contribution from dust. However,\nfollow-up simulations with more massive initial clumps\nwill be required to completely pin down the role of dust\nin observed SEDs.\nWe thank Roberto Galv\u00e1n-Madrid for helpful comments and stimulating discussions.
