INTRODUCTION\n\nThe statistical mechanics of systems with long-range interactions is currently a topic\nof active research [1]. Systems with long-range interactions are numerous in nature:\nself-gravitating systems, two-dimensional vortices, non-neutral plasmas, metallic clusters,\ndipoles, fracture etc... These systems exhibit similar features such as negative specific heats,\ninequivalence of statistical ensembles, phase transitions and self-organization. Since they\nare non-extensive and non-additive, the construction of an appropriate thermodynamics is\na challenging problem. Among all the previous examples, self-gravitating systems and 2D\nvortices play a special role because they both interact via an unshielded Newtonian potential\n(in dimensions D = 3 or D = 2) and possess a rather similar mathematical structure [2].\nIt has been recently argued that the classical Boltzmann entropy may not be correct\nfor systems with long-range interactions and that Tsallis entropies, also called q-entropies,\nshould be used instead [3]. In the context of 2D turbulence, Boghosian [4] has interpreted\na result of plasma physics [5] in terms of Tsallis generalized thermodynamics. In the astrophysical context, Plastino & Plastino [6] have noted that the maximization of Tsallis\nentropies leads to stellar polytropes, thereby avoiding the infinite mass problem associated\nwith isothermal systems obtained by maximizing the Boltzmann entropy. However, the\narguments advocated to justify Tsallis entropies in the context of 2D turbulence and stellar dynamics are usually unclear and misleading and were criticized in our previous papers\n[7\u20139]. In particular, we have argued that Tsallis entropies are particular H-functions (not\ntrue entropies) [10] whose maximization at fixed mass and energy determines (nonlinearly)\ndynamically stable stationary solutions of the 2D Euler or Vlasov-Poisson systems [11,12].\nThe H-functions can be useful in describing the metaequilibrium states resulting from incomplete violent relaxation [13]. In this context, the aforementioned maximization problem is\na condition of dynamical stability, not a condition of thermodynamical stability. Therefore,\nTsallis entropies have not a fundamental justification for stellar systems and 2D turbulence.\nThey form just a one-parameter family of H-functions that leads to simple models (stellar\npolytropes and polytropic vortices). Tsallis distributions can provide, however, a convenient fit of the metaequilibrium state in case of incomplete relaxation. In that context, the\nparameter q, which can vary in space, measures the importance of mixing [9].\nOn the other hand, it has been shown that Tsallis generalized thermodynamics could\nbe useful to interpret anomalous diffusion in complex systems and that the q-entropies are\nconnected to nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations [14]. In fact, Tsallis entropies are just a\nparticular class of a much larger class of functionals\nthat we shall call generalized entropies.\nR\nThese functionals are defined as S = \u2212 C(f )d3 rd3 v where C(f ) is a convex function\nof the distribution function. Many important properties obtained with Tsallis q-entropies\n(nonlinear Fokker-Planck equations, generalized H-theorem, Legendre transforms,...) remain valid for these more general functionals. Tsallis entropies give a special importance\nto power-laws. Power-laws are indeed important in physics (in relation, among other, with\nmultifractality [3]) but they are not the most general distributions. Generalized entropies\narise naturally when the diffusion coefficient is an arbitrary function D(f ) of the distribution\nfunction. When the diffusion is counter-balanced by a friction or a drift, they play the role\nof Lyapunov functionals and satisfy a H-theorem \u1e60 \u2265 0. In this context, Tsallis entropies\ncorrespond to a power-law dependance of the diffusion coefficient D(f ) \u223c f q\u22121 and the\n2\n\n\fq-parameter in Tsallis formalism is related to the exponent of anomalous diffusion.\nIn the first part of the paper, we develop a generalized thermodynamical formalism for\na large class of entropy functionals encompassing Boltzmann, Fermi and Tsallis entropies.\nThis formalism can have applications in different domains of physics (or biology, economy,\nmathematics,...) with different interpretations. In Sec. II A, we introduce generalized\nentropies that extend those introduced by Tsallis and co-workers. In Sec. II B, we establish\nthe conditions of generalized thermodynamical stablity in microcanonical and canonical\nensembles and discuss the possible inequivalence of statistical ensembles when the caloric\ncurve presents turning points or bifurcations. In Secs. II C and II D, we introduce generalized\nkinetic equations (Fokker-Planck, Landau) that conserve mass and energy and increase a\ngeneralized entropy functional instead of the Boltzmann entropy. In Sec. III, we study the\ngeneralized Smoluchowski-Poisson system and mention possible applications to bacterial\npopulations (chemotaxis).\nIn the second part of the paper (Sec. IV), we discuss the statistical mechanics of Hamiltonian systems with long-range interactions focusing on stellar systems and 2D point vortices (or inviscid continuous vorticity fields). We consider the collisionless regime when the\nN \u2192 +\u221e limit is taken before the t \u2192 +\u221e limit (Vlasov limit). Due to mean-field effects\nand long-range interactions, the system undergoes a violent relaxation (Sec. IV A). The\nresulting metaequilibrium state is a stationary solution of the Vlasov (or Euler) equation on\nthe coarse-grained scale. Its nonlinear dynamical stability can be settled via a thermodynamical analogy (Sec. IV B). Generalized entropies (also called H-functions) arise due to the\nexistence of fine-grained constraints (Casimirs), non-ergodicity and non-ideal effects (forcing,\ndissipation,...). We propose a novel relaxation equation (Sec. IV C) that can serve either\nas a small-scale parametrization of 2D turbulence (Sec. IV E) or as a powerful numerical\nalgorithm to compute arbitrary nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solutions of the\n2D Euler-Poisson system (Sec. IV D). We propose the idea of a classification of generalized\nentropies in \"classes of equivalence\" with the heuristic argument that entropies of the same\nclass should lead to similar results (Sec. IV F).\nII. GENERALIZED THERMODYNAMICS AND FOKKER-PLANCK\nEQUATIONS\nA. Generalized entropies\n\nLet us consider a system of N particles in interaction and denote by f (r, v, t) their\ndistribution function defined such that f d3 rd3 v gives the total mass of particles with position\nr and velocity v at time t. Let F(r, t) = \u2212\u2207\u03a6 be the force (by unit of mass) experienced\nR\nby a particle. We assume that theR potential \u03a6(r, t) is related to the density \u03c1(r, t) = f d3 v\nby a relation of the form \u03a6(r) = \u03c1(r\u2032 )u(r \u2212 r\u2032 )d3 r\u2032 where u(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) is an arbitrary binary\npotential. For example, if u(r \u2212 r\u2032 ) = \u2212G/|r \u2212 r\u2032 |, \u03a6 is solution of the Poisson equation\n\u2206\u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1.\n\n(1)\n\nWe assume that the system is isolated so that it conserves mass\nM=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1 d3 r,\n3\n\n(2)\n\n\fand energy\nE=\n\nZ\n\n1 2 3 3\n1\nf v d rd v +\n2\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6 d3 r = K + W,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere K is the kinetic energy and W the potential energy. The conservation of angular\nR\nR\nmomentum L = f (r \u00d7 v)d3 rd3v and linear impulse P = f vd3 rd3v can be easily incorporated in the formalism. The following\nresults remain valid if \u03a6 = \u03a6ext (r) is a fixed external\nR\n3\npotential, in which case W = \u03c1\u03a6ext d r.\nWe introduce a generalized entropy of the form\nS=\u2212\n\nZ\n\nC(f )d3 rd3 v,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C(f ) is a convex function, i.e. C \u2032\u2032 (f ) > 0. We are interested by the distribution function f which maximizes the generalized entropy (4) at fixed mass and energy. Introducing\nappropriate Lagrange multipliers and writing the variational principle in the form\n\u03b4S \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4E \u2212 \u03b1\u03b4M = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwe find that the critical points of entropy at fixed mass and energy are given by\nC \u2032 (f ) = \u2212\u03b2\u01eb \u2212 \u03b1,\n\n(6)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u01eb = v2 + \u03a6 is the energy of a particle by unit of mass. The Lagrange multipliers \u03b2 and\n\u03b1 are the generalized inverse temperature and the generalized chemical potential. Equation\n(6) can be written equivalently as\nf = F (\u03b2\u01eb + \u03b1),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere F (x) = (C \u2032 )\u22121 (\u2212x). From the identity\nf \u2032 (\u01eb) = \u2212\u03b2/C \u2032\u2032 (f ),\n\n(8)\n\nresulting from Eq. (6), f (\u01eb) is a monotonically decreasing function of energy if \u03b2 > 0. The\nconservation of angular momentum can be easily included in the variational principle (5)\nby introducing an appropriate Lagrange multiplier \u03a9. Equation (6) remains valid provided\nthat \u01eb is replaced by the Jacobi energy \u01ebJ = \u01eb \u2212 \u03a9 * (r \u00d7 v) = 21 (v \u2212 \u03a9 \u00d7 r)2 + \u03a6ef f where\n\u03a6ef f = \u03a6 \u2212 12 (\u03a9 \u00d7 r)2 is the effective potential accounting for inertial forces.\nAmong all functionals of the form (4), some have been discussed in detail in the literature.\nThe most famous functional is the Boltzmann entropy\nSB [f ] = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nf ln f d3 rd3 v.\n\n(9)\n\nIt leads to the isothermal (or Boltzmann) distribution\nf = Ae\u2212\u03b2\u01eb .\nClosely related to the Boltzmann entropy is the Fermi-Dirac entropy\n4\n\n(10)\n\n\fSF.D.

Recently, there was a considerable interest for functionals of\nthe form\nSq [f ] = \u2212\n\n1 Z q\n(f \u2212 f )d3 rd3 v,\nq\u22121\n\n(13)\n\nwhere q is a real number. Such entropies introduced by Tsallis [3] are called q-entropies.\nThey lead to \"polytropic\" distributions of the form\n3\n\nf = A(\u03bb \u2212 \u01eb)n\u2212 2 ,\n\n(14)\n\n1\n\nwith A = [(q \u2212 1)\u03b2/q] q\u22121 and \u03bb = [1 \u2212 (q \u2212 1)\u03b1]/(q \u2212 1)\u03b2. The index n of the polytrope\nis related to the parameter q by the relation n = 3/2 + 1/(q \u2212 1). Isothermal distribution\nfunctions are recovered in the limit q \u2192 1 (i.e. n \u2192 +\u221e).\nIn any system with f = f (\u01eb), one may define a local energy dependant excitation temperature by the relation\nd ln f\n1\n=\u2212\n.\nT (\u01eb)\nd\u01eb\n\n(15)\n\nFor the isothermal distribution (10), T (\u01eb) coincides with the thermodynamic temperature\nT = 1/\u03b2. For the polytropic distribution (14), T (\u01eb) = (q \u2212 1)(\u03bb \u2212 \u01eb). This excitation\ntemperature has a constant gradient dT /d\u01eb = q \u2212 1 related to Tsallis q-parameter (or\nequivalently to the index n of the polytrope). The other parameter \u03bb is related to the value\nof energy where the temperature reaches zero.\nB. Generalized thermodynamical stability\n\nIn the preceding section, we have just determined critical points of the generalized entropy\n(4) by cancelling its first order variations with appropriate constraints. We now turn to the\nthermodynamical stability of the solutions (in the generalized sense). We must select maxima\nof S[f ] at fixed mass and energy. The condition that f is a maximum of S at fixed mass and\nenergy is equivalent to the condition that \u03b4 2 J \u2261 \u03b4 2 S \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4 2 E is negative for all perturbations\nthat conserve mass and energy to first order. This condition can be written\n\u03b42J = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(\u03b4f )2 3 3\n1\nd rd v \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03b4\u03a6d3 r \u2264 0,\n2\n2\n\u2200 \u03b4f | \u03b4E = \u03b4M = 0.\nZ\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (f )\n\n5\n\n(16)\n\n\fSo far, we have implicitly worked in the microcanonical ensemble in which the energy is\nfixed. However, it may be of interest to study in parallel the canonical ensemble in which\nthe temperature T = 1/\u03b2 is fixed instead of the energy. In that case, the appropriate\nthermodynamical potential is the free energy F = E \u2212 T S that we write for convenience in\nthe form of Massieu function\nJ = S \u2212 \u03b2E.\n\n(17)\n\n\u03b4J = \u2212E\u03b4\u03b2 + \u03b1\u03b4M.\n\n(18)\n\nAccording to Eq. (5), we have\n\nTherefore, the equilibrium state in the canonical ensemble is a maximum of J at fixed mass\nand temperature. If we just cancel the first order variations of J, this again yields the\nrelation (6). The condition of thermodynamical stability in the canonical ensemble requires\nthat f is a maximum of J at fixed mass and temperature. This is equivalent to the condition\nthat \u03b4 2 J is negative for all perturbations that conserve mass. This can be written\n\u03b42J = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (f )\n\n(\u03b4f )2 3 3\n1 Z\nd rd v \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03b4\u03a6d3 r \u2264 0,\n2\n2\n\u2200 \u03b4f | \u03b4M = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nWe note that canonical stability implies microcanonical stability but the converse is wrong\nin general. Indeed, if inequality (19) is satisfied for all perturbations that conserve mass, it\nis a fortiori satisfied for perturbations that conserve mass and energy. Since the converse is\nwrong, this implies that we can \"miss\" some relevant solutions by working in the canonical\nensemble instead of the microcanonical one.\nFor self-gravitating systems described by the Boltzmann entropy (9), it is well-known\nthat the statistical ensembles are non-equivalent [15,2,9]. Indeed, an isothermal distribution\n(10) can be stable in the microcanonical ensemble (maximum of SB at fixed M and E) but\nunstable in the canonical ensemble (minimum or saddle point of JB at fixed M and T ).\nIn fact, the inequivalence of statistical ensembles for systems with long-range interactions\nis not limited to self-gravitating systems nor to the Boltzmann entropy (9). It occurs for\nmany other physical systems and for various functionals of the form (4). There will be\ninequivalence of statistical ensembles when the caloric curve \u03b2(E) presents turning points\nleading to regions of negative specific heats, or said differently, when the entropy S(E) has a\nconvex dip [16,17]. The stability of the solutions can be decided by using the turning point\ncriterion of Katz [18] which extends the theory of Poincar\u00e9 on linear series of equilibria. It\nis found that a change of stability in the series of equilibria occurs in the microcanonical\nensemble when the energy is extremum and in the canonical ensemble when the temperature\nis extremum. Stability is lost or gained depending on whether the series of equilibria turns\nclockwise or anti-clockwise at that critical point. A change of stability along a series of\nequilibria can also occur at a branching point [18,19], where the solutions bifurcate. A\ngeneral classification of phase transitions for systems with long-range interactions has been\nproposed recently by Bouchet & Barr\u00e9 [20].\n\n6\n\n\fC. Generalized Kramers equation\n\nWe shall now introduce a generalized Fokker-Planck equation, consistent with the thermodynamical framework developed previously, by using a Maximum Entropy Production\nPrinciple [21]. To apply the MEPP, we first write the relaxation equation for the distribution function in the form\n\u2202f\n\u2202Jf\n+ U6 * \u22076 f = \u2212\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202v\n\n(20)\n\nwhere U6 = (v, F) is a generalized velocity field in the six-dimensional phase space {r, v},\n\u22076 = (\u2202/\u2202r, \u2202/\u2202v) is a generalized gradient and Jf is the diffusion current to be determined.\nThe form of Eq. (20) ensures the conservation of mass provided that Jf decreases sufficiently\nrapidly for large |v|. From Eqs. (3), (4) and (20), it is easy to put the time variations of\nenergy and entropy in the form\n\u0116 =\n\n\u1e60 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nJf * vd3 rd3 v,\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (f )Jf *\n\n(21)\n\n\u2202f 3 3\nd rd v,\n\u2202v\n\n(22)\n\nwhere we have used straightforward integrations by parts. Following the MEPP, we shall\nnow determine the optimal current Jf which maximizes the rate of entropy production (22)\nwhile satisfying the conservation of energy \u0116 = 0. For this problem to have a solution, we\nshall also impose a limitation on the current |Jf |, characterized by a bound C(r, v, t) which\nexists but is not known, so that\nJf2\n\u2264 C(r, v, t).\n2f\n\n(23)\n\nIt can be shown by a convexity argument that reaching the bound (23) is always favorable\nfor increasing \u1e60, so that this constraint can be replaced by an equality. The variational\nproblem can then be solved by introducing at each time t Lagrange multipliers \u03b2 and 1/D\nfor the two constraints. The condition\n\u03b4 \u1e60 \u2212 \u03b2(t)\u03b4 \u0116 \u2212\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 Jf2 3 3\nd rd v = 0,\n\u03b4\nD 2f\n\nZ\n\n(24)\n\nyields an optimal current of the form\n\u2202f\n+ \u03b2(t)f v .\nJf = \u2212D f C (f )\n\u2202v\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(25)\n\nThe time evolution of the Lagrange multiplier \u03b2(t) is determined by the conservation of\nenergy \u0116 = 0, introducing Eq. (25) in the constraint (21). This yields\n\u2202f\nDf C \u2032\u2032 (f ) \u2202v\n* vd3rd3 v\nR\n\u03b2(t) = \u2212\n.\nDf v 2 d3 rd3 v\n\nR\n\n7\n\n(26)\n\n\fNote that the optimal current (25) can be written Jf = Df \u2202\u03b1/\u2202v where\n\u03b1(r, v, t) \u2261 \u2212C \u2032 (f ) \u2212 \u03b2\u01eb,\n\n(27)\n\nis a generalized potential which is uniform at equilibrium according to Eq. (6). Therefore,\nthe MEPP is just a variational formulation of the linear thermodynamics of Onsager.\nIntroducing the optimal current (25) in Eq. (20), we obtain the generalized FokkerPlanck equation\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202\nD f C \u2032\u2032 (f )\n+ U6 * \u22076 f =\n+ \u03b2(t)f v\n\u2202t\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n.\n\n(28)\n\nMorphologically, Eq. (28) extends the usual Kramers equation introduced in the context of\ncolloidal suspensions [22] and collisional stellar dynamics [23]. The first term is a generalized\ndiffusion (depending on the distribution function) and the second term is a friction. The\nfunction \u03b2(t) can be considered as a time dependant inverse temperature evolving with time\nso as to conserve energy (microcanonical formulation). The friction coefficient \u03be = D\u03b2\nsatisfies a generalized Einstein relation. Note that D is not determined by the MEPP since\nit is related to the unknown bound C(r, v, t) in Eq. (23). We can use this indetermination\nto write Eq. (28) in the alternative form\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202\n\u03b2(t)\nD\u2032\n+ U6 * \u22076 f =\n+ \u2032\u2032 v\n\u2202t\n\u2202v\n\u2202v C (f )\n\u0014\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(29)\n\nwhich will have the same general properties as Eq. (28). This equation involves an ordinary\ndiffusion and a nonlinear friction. Equation (29) can be deduced from Eq. (28) by the\nsubstitution D \u2032 = Df C \u2032\u2032 (f ). One of these two forms will be prefered depending on the\nsituation contemplated. Note that D or D \u2032 can depend on r, v, t without altering the general\nproperties of the equations.\nIt is straightforward to check that Eq. (28) with the constraint (26) satisfies a H-theorem\nfor the generalized entropy (4). From Eqs. (22) and (25), we can write\n\u1e60 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u2202f\nJf\n* f C \u2032\u2032 (f )\n+ \u03b2(t)f v d3 rd3 v + \u03b2(t)\nf\n\u2202v\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nZ\n\nJf * vd3 rd3 v.\n\n(30)\n\nThe last quantity vanishes due to the conservation of energy (21). Therefore,\n\u1e60 =\n\nZ\n\nJf2 3 3\nd rd v,\nDf\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is positive provided that D > 0. Now, at equilibrium \u1e60 = 0, hence Jf = 0, so that\naccording to Eq. (25),\n\u2202C \u2032 (f )\n+ \u03b2v = 0.\n\u2202v\n\n(32)\n\nIntegrating with respect to v, we get\nC \u2032 (f ) = \u2212\u03b2\n\nv2\n+ A(r).\n2\n8\n\n(33)\n\n\fThe cancellation of the advective term U6 * \u22076 in Eq. (28) combined with Eq. (33) implies\nthat f = f (\u01eb) and \u2207A = \u2212\u03b2\u2207\u03a6. Therefore, A(r) = \u2212\u03b2\u03a6(r) \u2212 \u03b1 and we recover Eq. (6)\nwith \u03b2 = limt\u2192+\u221e \u03b2(t). Therefore, a stationary solution of Eq. (28) extremizes the entropy\nat fixed energy and mass. In addition, only maxima of S at fixed M and E are linearly\nstable with respect to the generalized Fokker-Planck equation (28). Indeed, considering the\nlinear stability of a stationary solution of Eqs. (28) and (26), we can derive the general\nrelation (see Appendix A)\n2\u03bb\u03b4 2 J = \u03b4 2 \u1e60 \u2265 0,\n\n(34)\n\nconnecting the growth rate \u03bb of the perturbation \u03b4f \u223c e\u03bbt to the second order variations\nof the free energy J = S \u2212 \u03b2E and the second order variations of the rate of entropy\nproduction \u03b4 2 \u1e60 \u2265 0. Since the product \u03bb\u03b4 2 J is positive, we conclude that a stationary\nsolution of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation (28) is linearly stable (\u03bb < 0) if and only\nif it is an entropy maximum at fixed mass and energy (see Sec. II B). This aesthetic formula\nshows the equivalence between dynamical and thermodynamical stability for our generalized\nFokker-Planck equations. Therefore, they only select maxima of S, not minima or saddle\npoints.\nA relaxation equation appropriate to the canonical situation can be obtained by maximizing J \u0307 = \u1e60 \u2212 \u03b2 \u0116 with the constraint (23). The variational principle\n\u03b4 J \u0307 \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 Jf2 3 3\nd rd v = 0,\n\u03b4\nD 2f\n\n(35)\n\nagain yields an optimal current of the form (25) but with constant \u03b2.

(21), (22) and (25), we find that the free energy J increases monotonically\nuntil an equilibrium state of the form (6) is reached. In the canonical ensemble, we can show\nthat 2\u03bb\u03b4 2 J = \u03b4 2 J \u0307 \u2265 0 and conclude that a stationary solution of the generalized FokkerPlanck equation (28) with constant \u03b2 is linearly stable if and only if it is a maximum of free\nenergy at fixed mass and temperature (see Sec. II B).\nWe can also use the MEPP to construct a more general relaxation equation. Assuming\nthat the diffusion current in Eq. (20) depends on v and r and repeating the same steps as\nbefore, we get\n\u2202f\n+ U6 * \u22076 f = \u22076 D f C \u2032\u2032 (f )\u22076 f + \u03b2(t)f U6\u22a5\n\u2202t\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(37)\n\nwith\n\u03b2(t) = \u2212\n\nR\n\nDf C \u2032\u2032 (f )\u22076 f U6\u22a5 d3 rd3 v\nR\n,\nDf (U6\u22a5 )2 d3 rd3 v\n\n(38)\n\nwhere U6\u22a5 = (\u2212F, v). The generalized velocity U6 in phase space is very similar to the\nvelocity field of a two-dimensional incompressible fluid (see Sec. IV A). We note in particular\n2\nthat U6\u22a5 = \u22076 \u01eb, where \u01eb = v2 + \u03a6 plays the role of a generalized streamfunction.\n9\n\n\fTo conclude this section, it can be of interest to discuss some special cases explicitly. For\nthe Boltzmann entropy (9), C \u2032\u2032 (f ) = 1/f and Eq. (28) has the form of an ordinary Kramers\nequation\n\u2202f\n\u2202\n\u2202f\nD\n+ U6 * \u22076 f =\n+ \u03b2f v\n\u2202t\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nFor the Fermi-Dirac entropy (11), C \u2032\u2032 (f ) = 1/f (\u03b70 \u2212 f ). In order to avoid the divergence of\nthe term f C \u2032\u2032 (f ) as f \u2192 \u03b70 , it is appropriate to consider the alternative form (29) of the\ngeneralized Kramers equation. This yields\n\u2202f\n\u2202f\n\u2202\nD\u2032\n+ U6 * \u22076 f =\n+ \u03b2f (\u03b70 \u2212 f )v\n\u2202t\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\n\u0014\n\n\u001a\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\nwhich has been initially proposed in [21]. Finally, for the Tsallis entropy (13), C \u2032\u2032 (f ) = qf q\u22122\nand Eq. (28) has the form of a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation\n\u2202f q\n\u2202\n\u2202f\nD\n+ U6 * \u22076 f =\n+ \u03b2f v\n\u2202t\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nThis equation has been studied in detail recently in relation with Tsallis entropy and anomalous diffusion [14]. The underlying mechanism giving rise to anomalous diffusion may differ\ndepending on the physical system: L\u00e9vy walkers, porous media, vortex dipoles in 2D turbulence, etc... In such systems, the diffusion coefficient \u223c f q\u22121 is a power-law of the distribution\nfunction and the phase space has a fractal or multifractal structure (the exponent q is related to the fractal dimension). In fact, the nice properties of Eq. (41), in particular the\nH-theorem, go beyond the form of entropy considered by Tsallis and remain valid for all\nconvex function C(f ) even if the results are not always explicit. In the context of anomalous\ndiffusion, Eq. (28) can be obtained from a Langevin equation of the form\ndv\n= F \u2212 \u03bev +\ndt\n\ns\n\nC(f ) \u2032\nR(t),\n2Df\nf\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(42)\n\nwhere R(t) is a white noise. Since the function in front of R(t) depends on (r, v), the last\nterm in Eq. (42) is a multiplicative noise. When C(f ) is a power law, Eq. (42) reduces to\nthe stochastic equations studied by Borland [24].\nD. Generalized Landau equation\n\nWe shall now introduce another relaxation equation tending to a state of maximum\ngeneralized entropy at fixed mass and energy.

Contrary to the nonlinear Kramers equation\n(41), it seems that Eq. (48) has never been introduced previously. We shall study its\nproperties more specifically in a future work [27]. A connexion between the (generalized)\nLandau equation and the (generalized) Kramers equation can be found in a thermal bath\napproximation. In this context, f = f (v, t) describes a test particle and f \u2032 = f (v\u2032 , t)\ndescribes the field particles. If we replace f \u2032 in Eq. (43) by its equilibrium value (6), then\nEq. (43) becomes equivalent to the generalized Kramers equation (28) and the diffusion\ncoefficient can be calculated [27].\nIII. THE GENERALIZED SMOLUCHOWSKI-POISSON SYSTEM\nA. The high friction limit\n\nThe Kramers-Poisson system (39)-(1) is relatively complicated because it has to be solved\nin a six-dimensional phase space. However, it is well-known in Brownian theory [22] that,\nin the high friction limit \u03be \u2192 +\u221e (or equivalently for large times t \u226b \u03be \u22121 ), the velocity\ndistribution function becomes close to the Maxwellian distribution and the evolution of the\nspatial density \u03c1(r, t) is governed by the Smoluchowski equation\n\u2202\u03c1\n1\n= \u2207 (T \u2207\u03c1 + \u03c1\u2207\u03a6) .\n\u2202t\n\u03be\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n11\n\n(49)\n\n\fThe Smoluchowski-Poisson system has been studied in [28,29]. It models the dynamics of\nself-gravitating Brownian particles and the chemotactic aggregation of bacterial populations.\nWe now proceed in deriving a generalized Smoluchowski equation by taking the high\nfriction limit of the generalized Kramers equation. We shall assume that \u03b2 is constant\n(canonical situation). Integrating Eq. (28) over velocity, we get the continuity equation\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207(\u03c1u) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(50)\n\nwhere u = (1/\u03c1) f vd3v is the local velocity. Multiplying Eq. (28) by v and integrating\nover velocity, we get the momentum equation\nR\n\nZ\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202f\n\u2202\n(\u03c1ui ) +\n(\u03c1ui uj ) +\nPij + \u03c1\n= \u2212 D f C \u2032\u2032 (f )\n+ \u03b2f vi d3 v,\n\u2202t\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n\u2202vi\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(51)\n\nwhere Pij = f wi wj d3 v\nis the stress tensor and w = v \u2212 u the relative velocity. Introducing\nRf\nthe notation \u03c6(f ) =\nxC \u2032\u2032 (x)dx, the first term in the collision term can be rewritten\n\u2202\u03c6(f )/\u2202v and, since it is a gradient of a function, it vanishes by integration. We are left\ntherefore with\nR\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\u03a6\n\u2202\n(\u03c1ui uj ) +\nPij + \u03c1\n= \u2212D\u03b2\u03c1ui .\n(\u03c1ui ) +\n\u2202t\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xj\n\u2202xi\n\n(52)\n\nWe shall close this hierarchy of equations with the Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium\n(LTE) condition\nC \u2032 (f ) = \u2212\u03b2\n\n\u0012\n\nw2\n+ \u03bb(r, t) ,\n2\n\u0013\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03bb(r, t) depends only on position and time. This distribution function maximizes the\nlocal density of free energy at fixed density \u03c1 and velocity u. The Lagrange multiplier \u03bb is\nrelated to the spatial density \u03c1(r, t) through the relation\n\u03c1=\n\nZ\n\nf d3 v.\n\n(54)\n\nFurthermore, since the velocity distribution in Eq. (53) is isotropic, we have Pij = p\u03b4ij\nwhere p(r, t) is the local pressure\n1\np=\n3\n\nZ\n\nf w 2 d3 v,\n\n(55)\n\ndetermined by Eq. (53). From these two relations, we find that the fluid is barotropic in\nthe sense that p(r, t) = p[\u03c1(r, t)] where the function p[ ] is completely specified by C(f ). We\nhave thus obtained what might be called the damped Euler-Jeans equations\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ \u2207(\u03c1u) = 0,\n\u2202t\n\n(56)\n\ndu\n= \u2212\u2207p \u2212 \u03c1\u2207\u03a6 \u2212 \u03be\u03c1u,\ndt\n\n(57)\n\n12\n\n\fwhere d/dt = \u2202/\u2202t + u * \u2207 is the material derivative. These equations were first proposed in\n[21]. In the high friction limit, these equations can be simplified further since, to first order\nin \u03be \u22121 , we have\n1\n\u03c1u = \u2212 (\u2207p + \u03c1\u2207\u03a6),\n(58)\n\u03be\nwhich is obtained from Eq. (57) by neglecting the advective term. Note that the high friction\nlimit is consistent with the Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium (53). Indeed, in the high\nfriction limit \u03be = D\u03b2 \u2192 +\u221e, the term in bracket in Eq. (28) must vanish so that the\ndistribution function satisfies (53) in good approximation with u = O(\u03be \u22121). Inserting the\nrelation (58) in the continuity equation (56), we get a generalized form of the Smoluchowski\nequation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\u03c1\n1\n= \u2207 (\u2207p + \u03c1\u2207\u03a6) ,\n(59)\n\u2202t\n\u03be\ninitially proposed in [21]. The aesthetic form of this equation, in which the pressure p replaces\nnaturally the usual term \u03c1T in the familiar Smoluchowski equation, suggests by itself the\nconsistency of the generalized thermodynamical formalism. The condition of stationarity in\nEq. (59) corresponds to an equilibrium between the pressure force \u2212\u2207p and the mean-field\nforce \u2212\u03c1\u2207\u03a6. This is equivalent to Eq. (6). Indeed, using Eqs. (54), (55) and (6), one has\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n3\n\nZ\n\nf\n\n\u2202v 3\n1\nd v=\u2212\n\u2202v\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u2202f\n1\n* vd3 v = \u03b2\n\u2202v\n3\n\nZ\n\nv2 3\nd v,\nC \u2032\u2032 (f )\n\n1 \u2202f 2 3\nv2 3\n1\nv d v = \u2212 \u03b2\u2207\u03a6 *\nd v,\n3 \u2202r\n3\nC \u2032\u2032 (f )\nso that we obtain the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium\n\u2207p =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u2207p = \u2212\u03c1\u2207\u03a6.\n\n(60)\n(61)\n\n(62)\n\nFinally, we can show that the generalized Smoluchowski-Poisson system (59) satisfies a form\nof Virial theorem\n1 dI\n\u03be\n= 2K + W \u2212 3pb V,\n(63)\n2 dt\nR\nwhere I = \u03c1r 2 d3 r is the moment of inertia and pb the pressure on the box (assumed\nuniform). The proof is the same as that given in Appendix D of Ref. [29].\nTo conclude this section, we can consider particular forms of the generalized Smoluchowski equation. For the Boltzmann entropy (9), Eqs. (53), (54) and (55) lead to the\nisothermal equation of state p = \u03c1T and to the usual form (49) of the Smoluchowski equation. The case of the Fermi-Dirac entropy (11) has been treated in [21]. For the Tsallis\nentropy (13), Eqs. (53), (54) and (55) lead to the polytropic equation of state p = K\u03c1\u03b3 with\n\u03b3 = 1 + 1/n and Eq. (59) becomes the nonlinear Smoluchowski equation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\u03c1\n1\n= \u2207 (K\u2207\u03c1\u03b3 + \u03c1\u2207\u03a6) .\n(64)\n\u2202t\n\u03be\nThe nonlinear Smoluchowski-Poisson system has been studied in detail in Ref. [30]. It\ndescribes self-gravitating Langevin particles experiencing anomalous diffusion. It is likely\nthat anomalous diffusion occurs also in biological systems so that nonlinear Smoluchowski\nequations can find applications in the context of chemotaxis.\n13\n\n\fB. The Lyapunov functional\n\nIn Sec. II C, it was indicated that the Lyapunov functional associated with the generalized Kramers equation (28) with a fixed inverse temperature \u03b2 is the free energy J = S \u2212\u03b2E\nwith the generalized entropy (4). Therefore, the Lyapunov functional associated with the\ngeneralized Smoluchowski equation (59) will coincide with the simplified form of J obtained\nby using the Local Thermodynamical Equilibrium condition (53), with u = 0, to express\nJ[f ] as a functional of \u03c1. Using Eq. (55), the energy (3) can be written\n3Z\n1Z\npd3 r +\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r.\n2\n2\n\nE=\n\n(65)\n\nOn the other hand, it is shown in [9] that when f is given by Eq. (53), the entropy (4) can\nbe rewritten as\nZ\n5 Z\nS = \u03b2 pd3 r + \u03b2 \u03bb\u03c1d3 r.\n2\n\n(66)\n\nTherefore, the free energy reads\nJ =\u03b2\n\nZ\n\n3\n\npd r + \u03b2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u03bb\u03c1d r \u2212 \u03b2\n2\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r.\n\n(67)\n\nIt is shown furthermore in [9] that Eq. (67) can be put in the equivalent form\nJ = \u2212\u03b2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\n\n0\n\np(\u03c1\u2032 ) \u2032 3\n1\nd\u03c1\nd\nr\n\u2212\n\u03b2\n\u03c1\u20322\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r + C.\n\n(68)\n\nThis is the Lyapunov functional of the generalized Smoluchowski-Poisson system. Indeed, a\nstraightforward calculation yields\nJ \u0307 = \u03b2\n\nZ\n\n1\n(\u2207p + \u03c1\u2207\u03a6)2 d3 r \u2265 0.\n\u03be\u03c1\n\n(69)\n\nLet us consider particular cases. For the Boltzmann entropy (9), p = \u03c1T , and\nJ =\u2212\n\nZ\n\n1\n\u03c1 ln \u03c1d r \u2212 \u03b2\n2\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r.\n\n(70)\n\nStrictly speaking, 0\u03c1 p(\u03c1\u2032 )/\u03c1 2 d\u03c1\u2032 diverges logarithmically as \u03c1\u2032 \u2192 0. This means that the\ngeneral formula (68) is only marginally correct for an isothermal equation of state. However,\nassuming a Boltzmann distribution (10) since the begining (see [9]), we can check that\nEq. (70) is indeed the right formula. Finally, for the Tsallis entropy (13), p = K\u03c1\u03b3 with\n\u03b3 = 1 + 1/n, so that\nR\n\n\u2032\n\nJ = \u2212\u03b2n\n\nZ\n\n1\npd3 r \u2212 \u03b2\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r + Cn ,\n\n(71)\n\nwhere the constant can depend on n. Assuming a Tsallis distribution (14) since the begining\n(see [9]), we find that the free energy reads\n14\n\n\fJ =\u2212\n\n1\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n1\n(\u03b2K\u03c1\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c1)d3 r \u2212 \u03b2\n2\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r.\n\n(72)\n\nThis expression is consistent with Eq. (71) and it reduces to Eq. (70) in the limit n \u2192 +\u221e.\nHowever, it is more convenient to write the free energy in the form\n\u03b2K\nJ =\u2212\n\u03b3\u22121\n\nZ\n\n1\n(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1)d r \u2212 \u03b2\n2\n\u03b3\n\n3\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1\u03a6d3 r,\n\n(73)\n\nwhich is also consistent with Eqs. (71) and (70). Under this form, we can say that the high\nfriction limit of a q-Tsallis free energy in phase space is a \u03b3-Tsallis free energy in configuration\nspace with \u03b3 = (5q \u2212 3)/(3q \u2212 1). We note also that \u2212J/\u03b2 can be written \"E \u2212 KS\" which\nis similar to a free energy with K playing the role of a \"polytropic temperature\" (see [8]).\nIt is not clear whether this formal result bears more physical content than is apparent at\nfirst sights.\nThe generalized Smoluchowski equation (59) can also be written in the form\n\u2202\u03c1\n1\n= \u2207 (p\u2032 (\u03c1)\u2207\u03c1 + \u03c1\u2207\u03a6) .\n\u2202t\n\u03be\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(74)\n\nIf we introduce a convex function C(\u03c1) through the relation\n\u03c1C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c1) = \u03b2p\u2032 (\u03c1),\n\n(75)\n\nwe have equivalently\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2207 D(\u03c1C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c1)\u2207\u03c1 + \u03b2\u03c1\u2207\u03a6) ,\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(76)\n\nwhere we have defined D = 1/\u03b2\u03be.

The stationary solution of the\ngeneralized Smoluchowski equation (76) is given by\nC \u2032 (\u03c1) = \u2212\u03b2\u03a6 \u2212 \u03b1.\n\n(79)\n\nIt can be obtained by maximizing the free energy (78) at fixed mass and temperature.\nSimilarly, the generalized Smoluchowski equation (76) can be obtained by maximizing the\nrate of free energy production J \u0307 at fixed mass and temperature (see Sec. IV C).\nThe case of Boltzmann and Tsallis entropies in configuration space\nhas been discussed\nR\npreviously. The Fermi-Dirac entropy in configuration space S[\u03c1] = \u2212 {\u03c1 ln \u03c1+(\u03c10 \u2212\u03c1) ln(\u03c10 \u2212\n\u03c1)}d3 r leads to an equation of state p(\u03c1) = \u2212T ln(1 \u2212 \u03c1/\u03c10 ). For T \u2192 +\u221e, p = \u03c1T and for\n15\n\n\fT \u2192 0, \u03c1 is a step function with \u03c1 \u223c \u03c10 in the core and \u03c1 = 0 outside. The corresponding\ngeneralized Smoluchowski equation can be written\n\u2202\u03c1\n= \u2207 D \u2032 (\u2207\u03c1 + \u03b2\u03c1(\u03c10 \u2212 \u03c1)\u2207\u03a6) .\n\u2202t\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(80)\n\nComing back to the general case and expliciting the relation between \u03a6 and \u03c1, we can\nrewrite Eq.

The general study of this\nequation appears to be of considerable interest in view of its different potential applications.\nThis project has been initiated by [28\u201330] in particular cases.\nC. Generalized stability analysis\n\nThe equivalence between dynamical and thermodynamical stability for the generalized\nSmoluchowski equation (59) is proved in Appendix A. In fact, we can go further and reduce\nthe stability problem to an eigenvalue equation as was done in the special case of isothermal\nand polytropic distributions [28,30]. Let \u03c1 and \u03a6 refer to a stationary solution of Eq. (59)\nand consider a small perturbation \u03b4\u03c1 that conserves mass. We restrict ourselves to spherically\nsymmetric perturbations (non spherically symmetric perturbations do not induce instability\nfor non-rotating bodies). Writing \u03b4\u03c1 \u223c e\u03bbt and expanding Eq.

We have also found\na similar eigenvalue equation by analyzing the stability of barotropic stars with respect to\nthe Euler-Jeans equations [31,8,9]. These eigenvalue equations have been solved analytically\n(or by using simple graphical constructions) for an isothermal and a polytropic equation of\nstate in [31,8,9,29,30]. It is found that the case of marginal stability (\u03bb = 0) coincides with\nthe point of minimum generalized temperature 1/\u03b2 as predicted by classical turning point\narguments in the canonical ensemble [18]. The structure of the perturbation profile that\ntriggers the instability (in particular the number of nodes) has also been determined in our\nprevious papers. The present analysis shows that the structure of the mathematical problem\nremains the same for a general equation of state p = p(\u03c1) even if the solutions cannot be\nobtained analytically.\nIV. APPLICATION TO STELLAR DYNAMICS AND 2D TURBULENCE\nA. Violent relaxation and metaequilibrium state\n\nWe consider a two-dimensional incompressible and inviscid flow evolving in a plane perpendicular to the direction z. Let u = \u2212z \u00d7 \u2207\u03c8 denote the velocity field satisfying the\nincompressibility condition \u2207 * u = 0. The streamfunction \u03c8 is related to the vorticity\n\u03c9z = \u2207 \u00d7 u by the Poisson\nequation \u2206\u03c8 = \u2212\u03c9. More generally, we can consider a relation\nR\nof the form \u03c8(r) = g(r \u2212 r\u2032 )\u03c9(r\u2032 )d2 r\u2032 like, e.g., in the quasi-geostrophic model [32]. We\nassume that the dynamics is governed by the 2D Euler equation\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u\u2207\u03c9 = 0.\n\u2202t\n\n(95)\n\nThis equation describes the inviscid evolution of continuous vorticity flows. It also describes\nthe mean-field evolution of N \u226b 1 point vortices before discrete correlations have developed\n(Vlasov limit) [33,2]. The 2D Euler equation conserves the circulation\n\u0393=\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9d2 r,\n\n(96)\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\u03c8d2r,\n\n(97)\n\nthe energy\nE=\n\nand the vorticity momentsR (equivalent to the Casimirs) \u0393n = \u03c9 n d2 r. It also conserves\nthe\nR\n2 2\n2\nangular momentum L = \u03c9r d r in a circular domain and the impulse P = \u03c9yd r in a\nchannel (or in an infinite domain).\nWhen coupled to the Poisson equation, the 2D Euler equation develops very complex\nfilaments as a result of a mixing process. In this sense, the fine-grained vorticity \u03c9(r, t) never\nR\n\n18\n\n\fconverges towards a stationary solution. However, if we introduce a coarse-graining procedure, the coarse-grained vorticity \u03c9(r, t) rapidly relaxes towards a metaequilibrium state.\nThis is called violent relaxation, chaotic mixing or inviscid relaxation. This \"collisionless\nrelaxation\" is common to all Hamiltonian systems with long range interactions (stellar systems, point vortices, non-neutral plasmas, HMF model,...). It physically differs from the\n\"collisional relaxation\" (or viscous decay) which takes place for much longer times (often\nirrelevant). This implies that the order of the limits t \u2192 +\u221e and N \u2192 +\u221e (or \u03bd \u2192 0) is\nnot interchangeable [2].\nThere has been some attempts to describe the metaequilibrium state in terms of statistical mechanics [13,34\u201336]. In the context of 2D hydrodynamics, the statistical metaequilibrium state maximizes the mixing entropy\nS[\u03c1] = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1 ln \u03c1 d2 rd\u03c3,\n\n(98)\n\nwhile conserving circulation, energy and all the Casimirs. The mixing entropy is the Boltzmann entropy for \u03c1(r, \u03c3), the density probability of finding the value \u03c9 = \u03c3 in r. The most\nprobable distribution is the Gibbs state\n\u03c1(r, \u03c3) =\n\n1\n\u03c7(\u03c3)e\u2212(\u03b2\u03c8+\u03b1)\u03c3 ,\nZ(r)\n\n(99)\n\nwhere\n\u03c7(\u03c3) \u2261 exp(\u2212 n>1 \u03b1n \u03c3 n ) accounts for the conservation of the fragile moments \u0393n>1 =\nR\nn\n\u03c1\u03c3 d\u03c3d2 r and \u03b1, \u03b2 are the usual Lagrange multipliers for \u0393 and E (robust integrals) [9].\nR\nThe \"partition\nfunction\" Z = \u03c7(\u03c3)e\u2212(\u03b2\u03c8+\u03b1)\u03c3 d\u03c3 is determined byR the local normalization\nR\ncondition \u03c1d\u03c3 = 1. The equilibrium coarse-grained vorticity \u03c9 \u2261 \u03c1\u03c3d\u03c3 can be expressed\nas\nP\n\n\u03c9=\u2212\n\n1 \u2202 ln Z\n= F (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1) = f (\u03c8).\n\u03b2 \u2202\u03c8\n\n(100)\n\nSince \u2207\u03c9 = f \u2032 (\u03c8)\u2207\u03c8 and u = \u2212z \u00d7 \u2207\u03c8, this is a stationary solution of the 2D Euler\nequation. Taking the derivative of Eq. (100), it is easy to show that [37]:\n\u2032\n\n\u03c9 (\u03c8) = \u2212\u03b2\u03c92 ,\n\n\u03c92 \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03c1(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c9)2 d\u03c3 > 0,\n\n(101)\n\nwhere \u03c92 is the centered local enstrophy. We note that the relation \u03c9 = f (\u03c8) is always\nmonotonic, increasing at negative temperatures and decreasing at positive temperatures.\nTherefore, the coarse-grained vorticity \u03c9 extremizes a H-function [10]:\nS=\u2212\n\nZ\n\nC(\u03c9)d2r,\n\n(102)\n\nat fixed circulation and energy, where C(\u03c9) is a convex function, i.e. C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) > 0. Indeed,\nintroducing appropriate Lagrange multipliers and writing the variational principle in the\nform\n\u03b4S \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4E \u2212 \u03b1\u03b4\u0393 = 0,\nwe find that the critical points of entropy at fixed circulation and energy are given by\n19\n\n(103)\n\n\fC \u2032 (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03b2\u03c8 \u2212 \u03b1.\n\n(104)\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum and impulse can be easily included in the variational\nprinciple (103) by introducing appropriate Lagrange multipliers \u03a9 and U. Equation (104)\nremains valid provided that \u03c8 is replaced by the relative streamfunction \u03c8 \u2032 = \u03c8 + \u03a92 r 2 \u2212 Uy.\nEquation (104) can be written equivalently as\n\u03c9 = F (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1),\n\n(105)\n\nwhere F (x) = (C \u2032 )\u22121 (\u2212x). From the identity\n\u03c9 \u2032(\u03c8) = \u2212\u03b2/C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\n\n(106)\n\nresulting from Eq. (104), \u03c9(\u03c8) is monotonically decreasing if \u03b2 > 0 and monotonically increasing if \u03b2 < 0. Therefore, for any Gibbs state of the form (100), there exists a H-function\nof the form (102) that the coarse-grained vorticity \u03c9 maximizes (at fixed \u0393, E). It can be\nshown furthermore that \u03c9 maximizes this functional. We note that C(\u03c9) is a non-universal\nfunction which depends on the initial conditions. In general, S[\u03c9] is not the ordinary BoltzR\nmann entropy SB [\u03c9] = \u2212 \u03c9 ln \u03c9d2 r due to fine-grained constraints (Casimirs) that modify\nthe form of entropy that we would naively expect. In the two-levels approximation {\u03c30 , 0}\nof the statistical theory, S[\u03c9] is the Fermi-Dirac entropy\nSF.D.

IV F (from now on, we drop the bar on \u03c9 except in case of ambiguity).\nB. Dynamical stability and thermodynamical analogy\n\nUnfortunately, the statistical theory of violent relaxation is not very predictive because\nthe initial conditions are not known in practice and the Casimirs cannot be determined from\nthe coarse-grained field once the vorticity has mixed (since \u03c9 n 6= \u03c9 n ) [38]. In addition, the\nhigh order moments of \u03c9 are altered by non-ideal effects (viscosity, forcing,...) so that their\nstrict conservation is abusive [39,12]. Finally, the relaxation is in general incomplete so that\n20\n\n\fthe ergodic hypothesis which sustains the statistical theory is not fulfilled everywhere [40,7].\nOne aspect of incomplete violent relaxation is that the metaequilibrium structures (vortices,\ngalaxies,...) are more confined than predicted by statistical mechanics.\nThe only thing that we know for sure is that the metaequilibrium state reached by the\nsystem is a dynamically stable stationary solution of the 2D Euler-Poisson systems (on a\ncoarse-grained scale). Ellis and collaborators [12] have shown that a strong (nonlinear)\ncondition of dynamical stability is that \u03c9 maximizes a H-function at fixed circulation and\nenergy. This condition of dynamical stability can be written\n\u03b42J = \u2212\n\nZ\n\n(\u03b4\u03c9)2 2\n1\nd r \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4\u03c9\u03b4\u03c8d2 r \u2264 0,\n2\n2\n\u2200 \u03b4\u03c9 | \u03b4E = \u03b4\u0393 = 0.\nZ\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\n\n(111)\n\nThis is similar to a condition of microcanonical stability in thermodynamics. It is therefore\nrelevant to develop a thermodynamical analogy and use the same vocabulary as in thermodynamics to analyze the dynamical stability of 2D flows. In this analogy, S[\u03c9] can be called\na generalized entropy, \u03b2 a generalized inverse temperature,... In addition, we can introduce\na Legendre transform J = S \u2212 \u03b2E which is similar to a free energy in thermodynamics. The\ncondition that \u03c9 is a maximum of J at fixed temperature and circulation can be written\n2\n\n\u03b4 J =\u2212\n\nZ\n\n1\n(\u03b4\u03c9)2 2\nd r \u2212 \u03b2 \u03b4\u03c9\u03b4\u03c8d2 r \u2264 0,\nC (\u03c9)\n2\n2\n\u2200 \u03b4\u03c9 | \u03b4\u0393 = 0.\nZ\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\n(112)\n\nThis is similar to a condition of canonical stability in thermodynamics. The criteria (111)\nand (112) are not equivalent if the \"caloric curve\" \u03b2(E) presents turning points or bifurcations [41,12]. This corresponds to a situation of ensemble inequivalence in thermodynamics.\nSince canonical stability implies microcanonical stability (but not the converse), the stability\ncriterion (111) is stronger than (112). This has important implications in geophysical and\njovian fluid dynamics [12,42].\nThe H-function S[\u03c9] maximized by the system at metaequilibrium is non-universal. It\ndepends on the initial conditions and on the strength of mixing. The Tsallis entropy\n1\nSq [\u03c9] = \u2212\nq\u22121\n\nZ\n\n(\u03c9 q \u2212 \u03c9)d2r,\n\n(113)\n\nis a particular H-function that sometimes occurs in 2D hydrodynamics [4]. However, this\nis essentially fortuitous, as discussed in [7]. In addition, in this context, Tsallis functional\nis not a true entropy. Its maximization at fixed circulation and energy is a condition of\n(nonlinear) dynamical stability not a condition of thermodynamical stability. It leads to a\nparticular class of stable stationary solutions of the 2D Euler equation characterized by\n\u03c9 = A(\u03bb \u2212 \u03c8)n ,\n1\n\n(114)\n\nwith A = [(q \u2212 1)\u03b2/q] q\u22121 and \u03bb = [1 \u2212 (q \u2212 1)\u03b1]/(q \u2212 1)\u03b2. We shall call this class of vortices\npolytropic vortices by analogy with stellar polytropes [26]. The index n of the polytrope is\nrelated to the parameter q by the relation n = 1/(q \u2212 1). Isothermal vortices are recovered\n21\n\n\fin the limit q \u2192 1 (i.e. n \u2192 +\u221e). For q = 2, i.e. n = 1, the relationship between \u03c9 and \u03c8\nis linear [4].\nTo conclude this section, we note that dynamical stability results similar to (111) and\n(112) have been obtained for the Vlasov-Poisson system [11,9]. Therefore, the generalized\nthermodynamical formalism developed in Sec. II can be used to study the (nonlinear)\ndynamical stability of collisionless stellar systems in astrophysics and other systems with\nlong-range interactions described by the Vlasov equation.\nC. Relaxation equations for 2D flows\n\nAccording to the previous discussion, an important problem in 2D hydrodynamics is\nto construct particular stationary solutions of the 2D Euler equation with strong stability\nproperties. We shall consider solutions that maximize a H-function S[\u03c9] at fixed circulation\n\u0393 and energy E [12]. The explicit construction of such solutions is non-trivial. Expoiting\nthe thermodynamical analogy discussed previously and using the MEPP, we can obtain\nrelaxation equations (similar to Fokker-Planck equations) that can be used as numerical\nalgorithms to construct arbitrary stable stationary solutions of the 2D Euler equation. To\napply the MEPP, we write the relaxation equation in the form\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2212\u2207 * J\u03c9 ,\n\u2202t\n\n(115)\n\nwhere the diffusion current J\u03c9 has to be determined. The form of Eq. (115) ensures the\nconservation of circulation provided that J\u03c9 * n = 0 on the domain boundary (with normal\nvector n). From Eqs. (97), (102) and (115), it is easy to put the time variations of energy\nand entropy in the form\n\u0116 =\n\n\u1e60 = \u2212\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nJ\u03c9 * \u2207\u03c8d2 r,\n\n(116)\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)J\u03c9 * \u2207\u03c9d2r,\n\n(117)\n\nwhere we have used straightforward integrations by parts. Following the MEPP, we now\ndetermine the optimal current J\u03c9 which maximizes the rate of entropy production (117)\nwhile satisfying the conservation of energy \u0116 = 0 and the constraint\nJ\u03c92 \u2264 C(r, t).\n\n(118)\n\nThis maximization problem leads to the optimal current\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nJ\u03c9 = \u2212D \u03c9C (\u03c9)\u2207\u03c9 + \u03b2(t)\u03c9\u2207\u03c8 .\n\n(119)\n\nThe time evolution of the Lagrange multiplier \u03b2(t) is determined by introducing Eq. (119)\nin the energy constraint (116), using \u0116 = 0. This yields\nD\u03c9C \u2032\u2032(\u03c9)\u2207\u03c9 * \u2207\u03c8d2 r\nR\n.\n\u03b2(t) = \u2212\nD\u03c9(\u2207\u03c8)2d2 r\nR\n\n22\n\n(120)\n\n\fIntroducing the optimal current (119) in Eq. (115), we obtain a relaxation equation of the\nform\n\u001a \u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2207 D \u03c9C \u2032\u2032(\u03c9)\u2207\u03c9 + \u03b2(t)\u03c9\u2207\u03c8 .\n(121)\n\u2202t\nThe first term is a generalized diffusion and the second term is a drift. The function \u03b2(t) can\nbe considered as a time dependant inverse temperature (possibly negative). It evolves with\ntime so as to conserve the total energy E (microcanonical description). The drift coefficient\n\u03be = D\u03b2 is a generalized Einstein relation. We shall use Eq. (121) when \u03c9 \u2265 0. When \u03c9 can\nbe positive and negative, we shall prefer the alternative form\n\u001a \u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u03b2(t)\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2207 D \u2032 \u2207\u03c9 + \u2032\u2032\n\u2207\u03c8 ,\n(122)\n\u2202t\nC (\u03c9)\nEquation (122) is obtained from Eq. (121) by setting D \u2032 = D\u03c9C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9). It is straightforward\nto check that Eq. (121) with the constraint (120) satisfies a H-theorem for the generalized\nentropy (102). Indeed, Eq. (117), (116) and (119) lead to\nJ\u03c92 2\nd r,\n(123)\nD\u03c9\nwhere we have used \u0116 = 0. If \u03c9 \u2265 0, then Eq. (123) is positive provided that D \u2265 0. If we\nuse the alternative equation (122), we have D\u03c9 = D \u2032 /C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) so that Eq. (123) is positive\nwhatever the sign of \u03c9 provided that D \u2032 \u2265 0. At equilibrium \u1e60 = 0, hence J\u03c9 = 0, which is\nequivalent to\n\u1e60 =\n\nIntegrating, we get\n\nZ\n\n\u2207C \u2032 (\u03c9) + \u03b2\u2207\u03c8 = 0.\n\n(124)\n\nC \u2032 (\u03c9) = \u2212\u03b2\u03c8 \u2212 \u03b1.\n\n(125)\n\nwhich returns Eq. (104) with \u03b2 = limt\u2192+\u221e \u03b2(t). Therefore, as expected, a stationary\nsolution of Eq. (121) extremizes the generalized entropy (102) at fixed energy and circulation.\nIn addition, it is shown in Appendix B that the relation (34) remains valid so that only\nmaxima of S at fixed E and \u0393 are selected by the relaxation equation. The relaxation\nequation appropriate to the canonical situation is obtained by maximizing J \u0307 = \u1e60 \u2212 \u03b2 \u0116 with\nthe constraint (118). This leads again to an optimal current of the form (119) but with\nconstant \u03b2. In addition, Eqs. (123) and (34) remain valid with J in place of S. Hence, the\nfree energy J increases monotonically until a state of maximum free energy is reached.\nTo conclude this section, we shall discuss particular cases.

A physical numerical algorithm\n\nDue to the thermodynamical analogy, the relaxation equations proposed in Sec. IV C can\nprovide a powerful numerical algorithm to compute arbitrary dynamically stable stationary\nsolutions of the 2D Euler equation. Since we are only interested by the stationary solution,\nwe can forget the advective term in Eq. (122) and fix D to an arbitrary positive constant.\nWe propose therefore the physical numerical algorithm\n\u2202\u03c9\n\u03b2(t)\n= \u2207 D \u2207\u03c9 + \u2032\u2032\n\u2207\u03c8\n\u2202t\nC (\u03c9)\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(129)\n\nD\u2207\u03c9\u2207\u03c8d2r\n\u03b2(t) = \u2212 R (\u2207\u03c8)2\n.\nD C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) d2 r\nR\n\n(130)\n\nThese equations satisfy the conservation of circulation and energy (robust integrals) and\nincrease the generalized entropy (102) until the system has reached a maximum of S at\nfixed \u0393 and E. We have seen indeed that a minimum or a saddle point of S[\u03c9] are linearly\nunstable via Eqs. (129)-(130). Note that specifying C(\u03c9) does not directly determine the\nequilibrium state because many bifurcations can occur in parameter space (\u0393, E). There can\nalso exist local entropy maxima (similar to metastable states in thermodynamics) leading to\na complicated notion of basin of attraction (see [28] in a related context). These equations\ncould be used to study dynamical stability problems on a new angle [12]. Indeed, if a\nstationary solution of Eq. (129) is stable at fixed inverse temperature \u03b2 or at fixed energy\nE, then it is nonlinearly stable with respect to the 2D Euler equation. On the other hand,\nif a stationary solution of Eq. (129) is stable at fixed energy E (variable \u03b2(t)) but not at\nfixed inverse temperature \u03b2, then it violates Arnold's sufficient conditions of stability (see\nAppendix C) but is, however, dynamically stable with respect to the 2D Euler equation.\nThe relaxation equations proposed in Sec. II could be used similarly as numerical algorithms\nto construct nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solutions of the Vlasov equation.\nE. A simplified parametrization of 2D turbulence\n\nThe generalized Fokker-Planck equations derived in Sec. IV C can also provide a simplified parametrization of 2D turbulence. The thermodynamical parametrization proposed by\nRobert & Sommeria [43] can be written\n\u2202\u03c1\n+ u * \u2207\u03c1 = \u2207 D \u2207\u03c1 + \u03b2(t)\u03c1(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c1)\u2207\u03c8\n\u2202t\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(131)\n\nwhere \u03c1(r, \u03c3, t) denotes the density probability of finding the vorticity level \u03c3 in r at time t.\nEquation (131) incorporates a turbulent viscosity D and an additional term interpreted as a\nsystematic drift [44]. The drift is due to the inhomogeneity of the medium and is supported\nby arguments of kinetic theory in simplified models (point vortices, quasilinear approximation,...) [44,33,45]. Usual parametrizations including a single turbulent viscosity correspond\nto the infinite temperature limit (\u03b2 = 0) of the thermodynamical parametrization. Equation\n24\n\n\f(131) increases the mixing entropy S[\u03c1] while conserving the energy and all the Casimirs.\nFor t \u2192 +\u221e, the solution converges to the Gibbs state (99).\nThe equations of Robert & Sommeria [43] are complicated because they take into account\nthe conservation of all the Casimirs. This clearly leads to practical difficulties. This also\nleads to physical difficulties because the strict conservation of all the Casimirs is abusive as\ndiscussed in IV C. We could try to simplify the problem by writing a hierarchy of equations\nfor the moments of \u03c1. The first equation of this hierarchy is\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2207 D \u2207\u03c9 + \u03b2(t)\u03c92 \u2207\u03c8\n\u2202t\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(132)\n\nwhere \u03c92 is the local centered enstrophy defined in Eq. (101). However, we are now led\nto a difficult closure problem. Kazantsev et al. [46] have proposed to close the hierarchy of\nequations by a Gaussian approximation. This leads to an equilibrium state corresponding to\na minimum enstrophy state. Although this state may be relevant in some particular oceanic\nproblems (Fofonoff flows), this is not expected to be general.\nIn this paper, we propose to close the hierarchy of moment equations by a relation of\nthe form\n\u03c92 =\n\n1\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\n\n,\n\n(133)\n\nwhich can be deduced from Eqs. (101) and (106). This relation is valid at statistical\nequilibrium but we shall use it out of equilibrium as a convenient approximation. In a sense,\nthis supposes that the Lagrange multipliers \u03b1n associated to the fragile constraints \u0393n>1 in\nthe Gibbs state (99) can be treated canonically [12]. Substituting Eq. (133) in Eq. (132)\nwe obtain the simplified parametrization\n\u03b2(t)\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2207 D \u2207\u03c9 + \u2032\u2032\n\u2207\u03c8\n\u2202t\nC (\u03c9)\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\nD\u2207\u03c9\u2207\u03c8d2r\n,\n\u03b2(t) = \u2212 R (\u2207\u03c8)2\nD C \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) d2 r\nR\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(134)\n\n(135)\n\nwhich coincides with Eqs. (122) and (120). The function C(\u03c9) is a non-universal function\nwhich encapsulates the complexity of the fine-grained dynamics and which depends on the\nsituation contemplated (ocean dynamics, jovian atmosphere, decaying 2D turbulence...).\nFor a given physical situation, we propose to select a form of C(\u03c9) a priori and compute\nthe corresponding equilibrium state. Then, we can check a posteriori whether it was a good\nchoice by comparing the result with the information that we have on the system. This is\nsimilar to the notion of prior vorticity distribution proposed in [12]. Of course, this approach\nis essentially phenomenological and explanatory but it allows to deal with complex situations\nwhich were previously inaccessible.\nTo obtain an operational sub-grid scale parametrization of 2D turbulence, it remains for\none to specify the value of the diffusion coefficient. Heuristic arguments [47,21] or more\n1/2\nformal kinetic theory [45] suggest that D = K\u01eb2 \u03c92 where K is a constant of order unity\nand \u01eb is the scale of unresolved fluctuations. This formula is a relatively direct consequence\n25\n\n\fof the general Taylor expression of the turbulent viscosity [48] and it proved to be relevant\nin oceanic modelling [46]. Furthermore, it has been shown in previous works [47,21] that the\nspatial dependance of the diffusion coefficient is important to take into account the problem\nof incomplete relaxation and the formation of self-confined vortices [49]. With the closure\nrelation (133), the diffusion coefficient can be expressed in terms of \u03c9 as\nK\u01eb2\nD=q\n.\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9)\n\n(136)\n\nThe same simplifications could be introduced in the parametrization of the gravitational\nVlasov-Poisson proposed in [21].\nF. Classification of generalized entropies\n\nOur parametrization involves a free function C(\u03c9). This indetermination is intrinsic to\nthe problem of 2D turbulence and not really a flaw of our approach: there is no universal entropy S[\u03c9]. In order to reduce this indetermination, we shall argue that generalized\nentropies can be regrouped in \"classes of equivalence\" with the underlying idea that functionals of the same class will produce similar results. Then, for a given physical situation,\nit will be possible to pick a form of C(\u03c9) in the corresponding class of equivalence and use\nit in the parametrization (134)-(136).\nWe shall now present typical forms of \"generalized entropies\" S[\u03c9] that appeared in the\nliterature. Specifically, we shall prescribe analytical forms of the vorticity distribution \u03c7(\u03c3)\nin the Gibbs state (99) and compute the corresponding C(\u03c9). These analytical expressions\ncan be considered as prototypical examples of more realistic distributions. Consider first\nthe case where the fine-grained vorticity takes only two values \u03c30 and \u03c31 > \u03c30 so that\n\u03c7(\u03c3) = \u03c70 \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c30 ) + \u03c71 \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c31 ). In that case, \u03c9(\u03c8) is the distribution\n\u03c9 = \u03c30 +\n\n\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c30\n,\n1 + e(\u03c31 \u2212\u03c30 )(\u03b2\u03c8+\u03b1)\n\n(137)\n\nwhich can also be written as a tanh,\n\u03c30 + \u03c31 \u03c31 \u2212 \u03c30\n\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c30\n\u03c9=\n\u2212\ntanh\n(\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1) .\n2\n2\n2\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(138)\n\nFor this distribution, \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c31 , \u03c30 when \u2212\u03b2\u03c8 \u2192 +\u221e, \u2212\u221e. Using Eq. (104), we get\nC(\u03c9) = p ln p + (1 \u2212 p) ln(1 \u2212 p),\n\n\u03c9 = p\u03c31 + (1 \u2212 p)\u03c30 .\n\n(139)\n\nThis implies\nC \u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c30\n1\nln\n,\n\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c30\n\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c9\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n1\n.\n(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c30 )(\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c9)\n\n(140)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (140) in the general parametrization (134), we obtain\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2207 D \u2207\u03c9 + \u03b2(t)(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c30 )(\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c9)\u2207\u03c8\n\u2202t\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n26\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(141)\n\n\fwith a diffusion coefficient\nq\n\nD = K\u01eb2 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c30 )(\u03c31 \u2212 \u03c9).\n\n(142)\n\nThese equations coincide with the two-levels approximation of the thermodynamical\nparametrization (131). This two-levels approximation has been used in relation with shear\nlayer instability [40], vortex merging [43] and in a model of Jupiter's great red spot [50].\nTurkington [38] has considered the distribution \u03c7(\u03c3) = \u03c7 for \u03c30 \u2264 \u03c3 \u2264 \u03c31 and \u03c7(\u03c3) = 0\notherwise. The choice \u03b1n = 0 for n > 1 in Eq. (99) amounts to maximizing the entropy\n(98) at fixed energy and circulation, neglecting the higher order vorticity moments. If we\nassume for simplicity that \u03c30 = \u2212\u03bb and \u03c31 = +\u03bb then \u03c9(\u03c8) is the Langevin function\n1\nL(x) = coth(x) \u2212 .\nx\n\n\u03c9 = \u03bbL[\u2212\u03bb(\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)],\n\n(143)\n\nIt does not seem possible to write down the function C(\u03c9) explicitly. However, the relationship (143) is qualitatively similar to (138) so we argue that the Langevin-type model falls in\nthe same \"class of equivalence\" as the Fermi-Dirac-type model (i.e., they will produce the\nsame type of equilibrium states and bifurcations).\nConsider now a situation in which the fine-grained vorticity can take three values \u03c31 , \u03c32\nand 0 so that \u03c7(\u03c3) = \u03b4(\u03c3) + \u03c71 \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c31 ) + \u03c72 \u03b4(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c32 ). Consider furthermore the dilute limit\nof the statistical theory in which Z \u2243 1. In that case, the probability of the non-zero levels\nis given by pi = Ai exp[\u2212(\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)\u03c3i ] and \u03c9 = p1 \u03c31 + p2 \u03c32 . This dilute limit corresponds\nto the point vortex model [51]. If we assume furthermore, for simplicity, that \u03c30 = \u2212\u03bb and\n\u03c31 = +\u03bb we get the sinh-Poisson relation\n\u03c9 = \u22122A\u03bb sinh(\u03bb(\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)).\n\n(144)\n\nFor this distribution, \u03c9 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e as \u2212\u03b2\u03c8 \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. The sinh-relationship is observed in the\nlate stages of 2D turbulence when the initial condition is a random vorticity field [52]. This\nis because the vortices that form at intermediate times are very intense and isolated as in\na point vortex gas. Note that the statistical approach based on the conservation of all the\nCasimirs does not work in that case because of viscous effects [39]. Using Eq. (104), we find\nthat\n1\n\u03c9\n.\nsinh\u22121\n\u03bb\n2A\u03bb\n\n(145)\n\n1\u221a 2 2\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u2212\nsinh\u22121\n4A \u03bb + \u03c9 2 ,\n\u03bb\n2A\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n(146)\n\n1\n1\n\u221a\n.\n2\n\u03bb 4A \u03bb2 + \u03c9 2\n\n(147)\n\n\u0012\n\nC \u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n\u0013\n\nThen,\nC(\u03c9) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nand\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\nTherefore, in the case of 2D decaying turbulence with random initial conditions, the\nparametrization (134) that we propose is\n27\n\n\f\u221a\n\u2202\u03c9\n+ u * \u2207\u03c9 = \u2207 D \u2207\u03c9 + \u03b2(t)\u03bb 4A2 \u03bb2 + \u03c9 2 \u2207\u03c8\n\u2202t\n\u001a\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\u001b\n\n,\n\n(148)\n\nwith a diffusion coefficient\n\u221a\nD = K\u01eb2 \u03bb(4A2 \u03bb2 + \u03c9 2 )1/4 .\n\n(149)\n\nIf we assumes a Poissonian weight factor \u03c7(\u03c3) = exp(\u2212|\u03c3|/q) in Eq. (99), we get\n\u03c9=\u2212\n\n2q 2 (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)\n.\n1 \u2212 q 2 (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)2\n\n(150)\n\nPasmanter [53] has noted that this relationship yields results similar to those obtained with\nthe sinh-relationship, so they fall in the same \"class of equivalence\".\n2\nIf we now assume that the local distribution of vorticity is Gaussian so that \u03c7(\u03c3) = e\u2212\u03b12 \u03c3\nin Eq. (99), then the \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c8 relationship is linear [35] and can be written\n\u03c9 = \u2212\u03a92 (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1),\n\n(151)\n\nwhere \u03a92 = \u03c92 is a constant equal to the centered variance of the vorticity distribution.\nSuch a linear relationship sometimes occurs in geophysics [54]. The choice \u03b1n = 0 for n > 2\nis equivalent to maximizing the entropy (98) at fixed energy, circulation and enstrophy\n(neglecting the higher order moments). The function C(\u03c9) is\nC(\u03c9) =\n\n1 2\n\u03c9 ,\n2\u03a92\n\n(152)\n\nso that the generalized entropy S[\u03c9] is proportional to minus the (coarse-grained) enstrophy\nR\n\u03932 = \u03c9 2 d2 r. Therefore, Eq. (151) can also be obtained by minimizing the enstrophy at\nfixed energy and circulation [55]. A linear \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c8 relationship is also obtained in the strong\nmixing limit of the statistical theory providing an inviscid justification of the minimum\nenstrophy principle [56].\nAnother choice of probability distribution has been proposed by Ellis et al. [12] in a\nmodel of jovian atmosphere where the skewness is expected to play a crucial role. They\nrelate \u03c7(\u03c3) in the general formula (99) to the gamma density z a\u22121 e\u2212z (z \u2264 0) and find that\n\u03c9=\n\n\u2212\u03a92 (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)\n,\n1 + \u03bb\u03a92 (\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1)\n\n(153)\n\n1/2\n\nwhere \u03a92 is equal to the variance of \u03c7(\u03c3) and 2\u03bb\u03a92 is equal to the skewness of \u03c7(\u03c3).\nFor this relationship, \u03c9 \u2192 \u2212\u221e as \u2212(\u03b2\u03c8 + \u03b1) \u2192 1/\u03bb\u03a92 and \u03c9 \u2192 \u22121/\u03bb as \u2212\u03b2\u03c8 \u2192 +\u221e.\nTherefore, the gamma model (153) is somewhat intermediate between the tanh model (138)\nand the sinh model (144). Using Eq. (104), we find that the corresponding generalized\nentropy is\n1\n1\n\u03c9 \u2212 ln(1 + \u03bb\u03c9) .\nC(\u03c9) =\n\u03bb\u03a92\n\u03bb\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nThis yields\n28\n\n(154)\n\n\fC \u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n\u03c9\n,\n\u03a92 (1 + \u03bb\u03c9)\n\nC \u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) =\n\n1\n.\n\u03a92 (1 + \u03bb\u03c9)2\n\n(155)\n\nFor \u03bb \u2192 0, we recover the gaussian model (151) as a special case of the gamma model.

[46] in a barotropic ocean model.\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we have introduced a new class of relaxation equations associated with a\ngeneralized thermodynamical framework. The Fokker-Planck and nonlinear Fokker-Planck\nequations corresponding to Boltzmann and Tsallis entropies are recovered as a special case.\nThe potential applications of this new class of relaxation equations is considerable and concerns various domains of physics such as stellar dynamics, 2D turbulence, plasma physics,\nchemotaxis, porous media etc... For example, these equations can serve as numerical algorithms to compute arbitrary nonlinearly dynamically stable stationary solutions of VlasovPoisson or 2D Euler-Poisson systems. Physical applications of these equations and numerical\nsimulations will be presented in future works.\nWe have also clarified the concept of generalized thermodynamics introduced by Tsallis [3] and applied to self-gravitating systems and two-dimensional vortices by Plastino &\nPlastino [6] and Boghosian [4]. If we consider a collection of stars or point vortices and\ntake the long time limit (t \u2192 +\u221e at fixed N \u226b 1), the statistical equilibrium state resulting from a R\"collisional\" evolution is correctly\ndescribed by the ordinary Boltzmann entropy\nR\n3\n3\nSB [f ] = \u2212 f ln f d rd v or SB [\u03c9] = \u2212 \u03c9 ln \u03c9d2r but the thermodynamic limit is unusual\n(and does not correspond to N, V \u2192 +\u221e with N/V fixed) [2]. In the case of stellar systems,\nthere is no true equilibrium state but this corresponds to important physical processes (evaporation, gravothermal catastrophe) not to a breakup of thermodynamics [9]. The kinetic\ntheory of stars and point vortices is extremely complicated due to the long-range nature of\nthe interactions. Kinetic equations can be derived rigorously by using projection operator\ntechnics but they are non-Markovian and integro-differential [57,33]. The H-theorem for\nthe Boltzmann entropy cannot be proved without further approximations. In addition, the\ndiffusion coefficient depends on position, velocity and time and this can lead to a confinement of the structure in physical or phase space. These complicated effects (space and time\ndelocalizations) can induce, for intermediate collisional times, a deviation with respect to\nan ideal statistical evolution. However, the infinite time limit should be described by the\nBoltzmann distribution.\nOn the other hand, for times t \u226a trelax and N \u2192 +\u221e, a collection of stars or point\nvortices (or continuous vorticity flows) can achieve a metaequilibrium state as a result of a\n29\n\n\f\"collisionless\" (or inviscid) violent relaxation. Note that the domain of validity of the collisionless regime is huge for such systems since the collisional relaxation time trelax \u223c lnNN tD is\nmuch larger\nthan the dynamical time RtD [2]. The correct entropy is the Boltzmann entropy\nR\nS[\u03c1] = \u2212 \u03c1 ln \u03c1d\u03b7d3 rd3 v or S[\u03c1] = \u2212 \u03c1 ln \u03c1d\u03c3d2 r for \u03c1, the local distribution of phase levels or vorticity levels. The statistical metaequilibrium state is obtained by maximizing the\nBoltzmann entropy S[\u03c1] while conserving energy, circulation and an infinite class of invariants called the Casimirs. Alternatively, the coarse-grained distribution function or coarseR\ngrained vorticity\ncan\nalso\nbe\nobtained\nby\nmaximizing\na\nH-function\nS[f\n]\n=\n\u2212\nC(f )d3 rd3 v or\nR\nS[\u03c9] = \u2212 C(\u03c9)d2 r, where C is a convex function, while conserving only mass (circulation)\nand energy (robust constraints). This functional depends on the initial conditions and is\ntherefore non-universal. In this context, \"generalized entropies\" arise due to the presence\nof fine-grained constraints (Casimirs) that modify the macroscopic form of entropy that\nwe would naively expect. This is a particularity of continuous Hamiltonian systems and\nthis makes the equilibrium state difficult (if not impossible) to predict. A classification of\ngeneralized entropies in classes of equivalence can however be attempted.\nFurthermore, it can happen that the mixing process during the collisionless relaxation is\nnot sufficient to justify the ergodic hypothesis which sustains the statistical theory. In that\ncase, the metaequilibrium state results from an incomplete violent relaxation. One possibility\nto take into account incomplete mixing and non-ergodicity is to introduce additional kinetic\nconstraints in the statistical approach. This can be done by using relaxation equations\nwith a variable diffusivity related to the local fluctuations of the vorticity or distribution\nfunction [47,21]. Accordingly, the physical picture that emerges is the following: during\nviolent relaxation, the system has the tendency to reach the most mixed state described by\nthe Gibbs distribution. However, as it approaches equilibrium, the mixing becomes less and\nless efficient and the system settles on a stationary state which is not the most mixed state.\nThen, the evolution is stopped until other effects (collisions, viscosity,...) come into play.\nThe state resulting from an incomplete violent relaxation is a (nonlinearly) dynamically\nstable stationary solution of the Vlasov or 2D Euler equation on the coarse-grained scale. A\nstrong condition of stability is that it maximizes a H-function at fixed mass (circulation) and\nenergy [11,12]. Since this condition of nonlinear dynamical stability is similar to a condition\nof thermodynamical stability, we can use a thermodynamical analogy to study the dynamical\nstability of stellar systems and 2D vortices. In this analogy, the H-function can be regarded\nas a generalized entropy. The H-function maximized by the system at metaequilibrium\ndepends on the initial conditions, on the efficiency of mixing and on non-ideal effects. Tsallis\nentropy is just a particular H-function leading to polytropic distributions. It can sometimes\nprovide a good fit of the metaequilibrium state in case of incomplete relaxation [4] but this\nis not general [7]. Most galaxies and 2D vortices are not described by Tsallis polytropic\ndistribution. A better model is a composite model with an isothermal core where mixing is\nefficient (q = 1) and a polytropic halo (q 6= 1) where relaxation is incomplete [9].\nIn conclusion, generalized entropies arise when hidden constraints are in action: Casimir\ninvariants, kinetic constraints preventing mixing, forcing and dissipation, geometrical structure of phase space (fractality) etc... We can either work with the Boltzmann entropy and\ntry to take into account these additional constraints or keep only the usual constraints (mass\nand energy) and change the form of entropy. The second possibility, while leading to some\nindeterminations, is often more convenient.\n30\n\n\fACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nI thank F. Bouchet, J. Sommeria and C.
