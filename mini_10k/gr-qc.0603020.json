In contrast to the original Kaluza-Klein theories of extra dimensions, the recent incarnations\nof extra dimensional theories allow the extra dimensions to be large and even infinite in size (in the original KaluzaKlein theories the extra dimensions were curled up or compactified to the experimentally unobservable small size\nof the Planck length: 10\u221233 cm). These new extra dimensional theories have opened up new avenues to explaining\nsome of the open questions in particle physics (the hierarchy problem, nature of the electro-weak symmetry breaking,\nexplanation of the family structure) and astrophysics (the nature of dark matter, the nature of dark energy) [1] - [3].\nIn addition they predict new experimentally measurable phenomenon in high precision gravity experiments, particle\naccelerators, and in astronomical observations.\nMost of the brane world models use infinitely thin branes with delta-like localization of matter. However these\nmodels are generally regarded as an approximation since any fundamental underlying theory, such as quantum gravity\nor string theory, must contain a fundamental length beyond which a classical space-time description is impossible. It\nis therefore necessary to justify the infinitely thin brane approximation as a well-defined limit of a smooth structure\n\u2013 a thick brane \u2013 obtainable as a solution to coupled gravitational and matter field equations. One early example of\na thick brane comes from the 5 dimensional model considered in [4] where one had a topologically non-trivial field\nconfiguration for the scalar field.\nIn Ref. [5], the picture is presented that our universe is a dynamically localized 3-brane in a higher dimensional\nspace (\"brane world\" ). As an example, the dynamics of the Nielsen-Olesen vortex type in six dimensional spacetime\nis adopted to localize our space-time within a 3-brane. At low energies, everything is trapped in the 3-brane, and the\nEinstein gravity is induced through the fluctuations of the 3-brane.\nIt is therefore of great interest to formulate some general requirements on the brane world design leading to the\nappearance of stable, thick branes having a well-defined zero thickness limit and able to trap ordinary matter. Taking\na physically reasonable stress-energy tensor it was shown that in 6 dimensions [6] and also higher extra dimensions\n[7] one can trap all the Standard Model fields using gravity alone.\nIn Ref's [8] thick brane world models are studied as Z2 -symmetric domain walls supported by a scalar field with\nan arbitrary potential V (\u03c6) in 5D general relativity and it was shown that in the framework of 5D gravity, a globally\nregular thick brane always has an anti-de Sitter asymptotic and is only possible if the scalar field potential V (\u03c6) has\nan alternating sign.\nIn Ref's [9] - [14] some properties of brane models was investigated: localization of gravity, graviton ground state,\nstability and so on.\nIn Ref. [15] a comparative analysis of localization of 4D gravity on a non Z2 -symmetric scalar thick brane in both\n5-dimensional Riemannian space time and pure geometric Weyl integrable manifold is presented.\nMultidimensional space-times with large extra dimensions turned out to be very useful when addressing several\nproblems of the recent non\u2013supersymmetric string model realization of the Standard Model at low energy with no\nextra massless matter fields [16].\nIn Ref. [17] it is shown that two interacting non-gravitating scalar fields with a non-trivial potential may have a\nregular spherically symmetric solution. This solution shows that one can avoid the Derrick's theorem [18] forbidding\nthe existence of regular static solution in the spacetime with the dimension greater 2 for scalar fields if the potential\n\n\u2217\n\nSenior Associate of the Abdus Salam ICTP\naddress: dzhun@krsu.edu.kg\n\n\u2020 Electronic\n\n\f2\nhas a local minimum besides global one. This result allows us to assume that the inclusion of gravitation may not\ndestroy the regularity of similar solutions in 5D spacetime. In Ref. [19] one example of spherically symmetric solution\nwith a gravitating scalar field is given but in contrast with the solution that will be presented here the potential of\nthe scalar field in Ref. [19] is negative.\nThe goal of this investigation is to show that there exists a new kind of thick brane solutions that is different with\nthick brane solutions found in Ref's [20] [21]. We will show that the asymptotical behavior of one scalar field allow\nus to offer trapping of Maxwell electrodynamics and spinor fields on the brane. Especially it is necessary to note that\nthe consideration of two scalar fields allow us to obtain the regular thick brane solution with the potential bounded\nfrom below.\nII.\n\nINITIAL EQUATIONS\n\nWe consider 5D gravity + two interacting fields. The key for the existence of a regular solution here is that the\nscalar fields potential have to have local and global minima, and at the infinity the scalar fields tend to a local but\nnot to global minimum.\nThe 5D metric is\nds2 = a(y)\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 dy 2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3; y is the 5th coordinate; \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = {+1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121} is the 4D Minkowski metric.

We consider the case when the\nfunctions \u03c6, \u03c7 are \u03c6(y), \u03c7(y).

For m1 < m\u22171,i the function \u03c7i (y) \u2192 +\u221e and for m1 > m\u22171,i\nthe function \u03c7i (y) \u2192 \u2212\u221e (here the index i is the approximation number). One can say that in this case we solve a\nnon-linear eiqenvalue problem: \u03c7\u2217i (y) is the eigenstate and m\u22171,i is the eigenvalue on this Step.\nStep 2. On the second step we solve Eq. (13) using zero approximation a0 (y) for the function a(y) and the\nfirst approximation \u03c7\u22171 (y) for the function \u03c7(y) from the Step 1. For m2 < m\u22172,1 the function \u03c61 (y) \u2192 +\u221e and for\nm2 > m\u22172,1 the function \u03c61 (y) \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Again we have a non-linear eiqenvalue problem for the function \u03c61 (y) and\nm\u22172,1 .\nStep 3. On the third step we repeat the first two steps that to have the good convergent sequence \u03c6\u2217i (y), \u03c7\u2217i (y).\nPractically we have made three approximations.\nStep 4. On the next step we solve Eq. (11) which gives us the function a1 (y).\nStep 5. On this step we repeat Steps 1-4 necessary number of times that to have the necessary accuracy of definition\nof the functions a\u2217 (y), \u03c6\u2217 (y), \u03c7\u2217 (y).\nAfter Step 5 we have the solution presented on Fig. 1. These numerical calculations give us the eigenvalues\nm\u22171 \u2248 2.122645756, m\u22172 \u2248 1.3721439906788 and eigenstates a\u2217 (y), \u03c6\u2217 (y), \u03c7\u2217 (y).

(28) as follows:\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nD\u03bd F\u0303 B\u03bd + D5 F\u0303 B5 = \u00c3B (xD ) \u03b1\u03c62 \u2212 m2 .\n\n(29)\n\nWe will use the gauge \u00c35 = 0 and search for a solution of (29) in the form:\nD\u03bd F\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\nD5 F\u0303\n\nB5\n\nB\n\n(30)\nD\n\n\u0002\n\n2\n\n= \u00c3 (x ) \u03b1\u03c6 \u2212 m\n\n2\n\n\u0003\n\n(31)\n\n\f5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n0\n\nchi\n\nphi\n\n\u22122\n\nFIG. 3: The profile of the potential V (\u03c6, \u03c7).\n\nFor the solution we will use the following ansatz\n\u00c3B (xD ) = AB (x\u03bc )f (y),\n\n(32)\n\nwhere AB (x\u03bc ) is the 4D electromagnatic potential function only on 4D coordinates. Then from Eq's (30) (31) we will\nhave\nD\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1 d\na\u2032 \u2032\n4 df\n\u2032\u2032\na\n= f \u03b1\u03c62 \u2212 m2\nf +4 f = 4\na\na dy\ndy\n\n(33)\n(34)\n\nwhere the first equation is the usual 4D Maxwell equations on the brane. The solution of the second equation on\nthe background of the thick brane is presented in Fig.4. Here it is necessary to note that again the regular solution\nf (y) exists for an exceptional value of the parameter m only. It is easy to see from Eq. (34): this equation is exactly\nSchrodinger equation with the potential \u03b1\u03c62 (which is a hole). Eq. (34) has a regular solution describing a particle\nin a hole for an exceptional value of m that is an eigenvalue of the Schrodinger equation (34).\nAs one can see, the EM field is trapped on the 4D brane. In this case the electromagnetic fields in the bulk are\n\u00c3(xB ) = A(x\u03bc )f (y)\n\n(35)\n\nwhere f (y) is the exponentially decreasing function.\nLet us consider further the question about trapping of fermion fields on the brane. In the simplest case such a\npossibility was pointed out in Ref. [23] at consideration of the brane model as the model of domain wall. In this work\nthe model of one real scalar field \u03c6 with two degenerated minima was introduced for description of the domain wall\nin 5D spacetime. In this case existing kink solution has its asymptotes in these minima with constant values of the\nfield \u03c6. In our case similar situation occurs: two scalar fields \u03c6, \u03c7 create the system with two local minima, and the\nsolutions tend asymptotically to one of these minima where the field \u03c7 tends to zero and \u03c6 to the constant values as\nin the case from Ref. [23].\nIt allows us to investigate trapping of fermions on the brane for our case by analogy with Ref. [23]. The curved\nspace 5D gamma matrices are\n1\n\u0393\u03bc = \u221a \u03b3 \u03bc ,\na\n\n\u0393r = \u2212i\u03b3 5 ,\n\n(36)\n\n\f6\n\n1,0\n\n0,8\n\n0,6\n\n0,4\n\n0,2\n\n0,0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: The function f (r) with \u03b1 = 2 and m \u2248 1.6256513943551\n\nwhere \u03b3 \u03bc and \u03b3 5 are the usual Dirac matrices in 4D theory\n\u0013\u001b\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u001a\u0012\n0 ~\u03c3\n0 I\n\u03bc\n,\n,\n\u03b3 =\n\u2212~\u03c3 0\nI 0\n\n5\n\n\u03b3 =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u22121 0\n0 1\n\n\u0013\n\n(37)\n\nwhere \u03c3 i are usual Pauli matrices in flat spacetime. Then using the action for interacting scalar \u03c6 and fermion \u03a8\nfields we have\nZ\n\u0001\nS\u03a8 = d4 x dr i\u03a8\u0393A DA \u03a8 \u2212 h\u03c6\u03a8\u03a8\n(38)\nhere \u03c6 is the scalar field from the Lagrangian (2) and h is a constant. The Dirac equation can be written in the form\ni\u0393A DA \u03a8 \u2212 h\u03c6(y)\u03a8 = 0.\n\n(39)\n\nHere DA = \u2202A + \u03a5A , where pseudo-connection \u03a5A can be defined as follows [24]\n\u03a5A =\n\n\u0011\n1 N \u0010\nM\u0304\n\u2212\n\u2202\ne\neM\u0304 \u2202A eM\u0304\nN\nN\nA ,\n2\n\nM\u0304 N\u0304\nA\nAB\nwhere the vielbein eM\u0304\n= eA\neB \u03b7 M\u0304 N\u0304 . For our\nA is defined via gAB = eA eB \u03b7M\u0304 N\u0304 , and the inverse vielbein eM\u0304 via g\nM\u0304 N\u0304\n\u2032\ncase \u03a5A = (0, 0, 0, 0, a /a).\nLet us consider ansatz\n\n\u03a8(xB ) = \u03c8(x\u03bc )\u03a80 (y)\n\n(40)\n\nIf we are interested in localization of zero modes, then, as it was shown in Ref. [25], there are the solutions of Eq.\n(39) with 4D mass m = 0. For the zero mode \u03b3 \u03bc D\u03bc \u03c8 = 0, and the Dirac equation (39) turns out in the equation:\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\u2032\n\u03b3 5 \u2202r +\n\u03a80 = h\u03c6(y)\u03a80 ,\n(41)\na\nwhere \u2032 means the derivative with respect to r. Eq. (41) with account of (40) has the following solution:\n\u0012 \u2032\n\u0014 Z r\n\u0013\u0015\na\n\u03a8 = exp \u2212\ndr\u2032\n+ h\u03c6(r\u2032 ) \u03c8(x\u03bc ),\na\n0\n\n(42)\n\nwhere \u03c8(x\u03bc ) is the usual solution of 4D Weyl equation, and the condition \u03b35 \u03a80 = \u2212\u03a80 is taken into account. As\nit was shown in Section III, the sum (a\u2032 /a + h\u03c6) tends asymptotically to some constant. So the zero mode (42) is\nlocalized near r = 0, i.e. on the brane, and decreases exponentially at large r: \u03a80 \u221d exp (\u2212m5 |y|).\n\n\f7\nLet us note that one can include the function \u03c7 in Eq's (27) and (38) by the following way:\n\u0001\nchange\nchange\n\u03b1\u03c62 \u00c3B \u00c3B \u2212\u2192 \u03b1 \u03c62 + \u03c72 \u00c3B \u00c3B and h\u03c6\u03a8\u03a8 \u2212\u2192 h (\u03c6 + \u03c7) \u03a8\u03a8 but it does not matter because the asymptotical\nr\u2192\u221e\nr\u2192\u221e\nbehavior of the function \u03c6 \u2212\u2192 m1 is important only (as \u03c7 \u2212\u2192 0).\nLet us note that we do not consider trapping of scalar fields on this brane. The reason is very simple: we have\nshown exactly that two scalar fields with Lagrangian (2) are confined on the brane. The situation is even better:\nthese scalar fields create the brane ! It is necessary note that in the process of numerical calculation we have obtained\na domain wall solution without gravity, i.e. two scalar fields can create the solution with the planar symmetry and\nswitching on the gravity does not destroy this solution.\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow we would like to list the essential specialities of the presented solution:\n1. The existence of the solution crucially depends on the number of interacting scalar fields (n > 1) and the presence\nof the non-trivial potential V (\u03c6, \u03c7) which has local and global minima. At the infinity the scalar fields tend to\nlocal minimum and the potential has alternating sign when r \u2208 [0, \u221e] that to the existence of the presented\nsolution. The numerical investigation shows that in the presence of one scalar field the similar solution does not\nexist.\n2. The advantage of the presented solution is that the asymptotical behavior (22) of the scalar field \u03c6 allow us to\nobtain trapping of electromagnetic and spinor fields on the brane.\n3. Let us note that the thick brane solution presented here differs from the thick brane solutions presented in Ref's\n[20] and [21] that:\n(a) thick brane solution from Ref. [20] is obtained for the scalar field with the potential unbounded from below\nthat in contrast with our potential (3) which is bounded from below.\n(b) in Ref. [21] the thick brane solution is obtained for scalar fields having non-trivial asymptotical topological\nstructure in contrast with our solution.\n4. The solution is topologically trivial. It means that at the infinity two scalar fields do not form a hedgehog\nconfiguration in contrast with the thick brane solutions presented in Ref. [21].\n5. The quantity V (\u03c6(\u221e), \u03c7(\u221e)) can be considered as a 5D cosmological constant \u039b.\n6. In Ref. [17] it is shown that after some simplification and assumtions the SU(3) gauge Lagrangian can be\nreduced to the Lagrangian (2) describing interacting scalar fields \u03c6 and \u03c7. This remark allows us to assume\nthat a real thick brane can be formed by a 5D gauge condensate which is described by interacting scalar fields.\n7. According to the previous item (6) the 5D mechanism of trapping the matter on a thick brane may be similar\nto the confinement mechanism in 4D quantum chromodynamics. In this case trapping of the corresponding\nquantum gauge fields on the thick brane is non-perturbative and can not be investigated using Feynman diagram\ntechnique.\n8. If the thick brane is formed with the help of a gauge condensate then the problem of the stability of the thick\nbrane becomes very non-trivial. It occurs because a non-static condensate has to be described in much more\ncomplicated manner than static condensate in Ref. [17]. It is connected to that fact that the change in time of\nquantum object is connected not only to the change of this quantity but also to the change of a wave function\nas well.\n9. From the mathematical point of view the presented solution is an eigenstate for a nonlinear eigenvalue problem.\n\n[1] N. Arkani-Hamed, S. Dimopoulos and G. Dvali, Phys. Lett. B 429, 263 (1998);\nI.
