Although an unambiguous detection has not been\ndeclared with present-generation instruments, next-generation Earth-based interferometers\nand pulsar-timing experiments, as well as the LISA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna)\nmission [7] are expected to achieve this goal.\nLISA, jointly proposed to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nand the European Space Agency (ESA), is expected to be flown sometimes in the next\ndecade. Its goal is to detect and study gravitational waves (GW) in the millihertz frequency\nband. It will use coherent laser beams exchanged between three identical spacecraft forming\na giant (almost) equilateral triangle of side 5 \u00d7 106 kilometers. By monitoring the relative\nfrequency changes of the light beams exchanged between the spacecraft, it will extract the\ninformation about the gravitational waves it will observe at unprecedented sensitivities [7].\nThe astrophysical sources that LISA is expected to observe within its operational frequency\nband (10\u22124 \u2212 1 Hz) will be very large in number, including galactic and extra-galactic\ncoalescing binary systems containing white dwarfs and neutron stars, extra-galactic supermassive black-hole coalescing binaries, and a stochastic gravitational wave background from\nthe early universe [8, 9].\nThe first unambiguous detection of a gravitational wave signal, whether performed on\nthe ground or in space, will also allow us to test Einstein's general theory of relativity (GR)\nby measuring the polarization components of the detected signals [10, 11]. Among all the\nproposed relativistic metric theories of gravity [12], GR is the most restrictive, allowing for\nonly two of possible six different polarizations [13]. By asserting that the spin-2 (\"tensor\")\npolarizations are the only polarization components observed, we would make a powerful\nproof of the validity of Einstein's theory of relativity, while a clear observation of some other\npolarization modes would disqualify it. Corroboration of polarization measurements with\n\n2\n\n\festimates of the propagation speed of the observed gravitational wave signal will provide\nfurther insight into the nature of the observed radiation and result into the determination\nof the mass of the graviton. It should be emphasized, however, that a propagation-speed\nmeasurement alone consistent with a value equal to the speed of light, would not automatically rule-out other relativistic metric theories of gravity. This is because waves with helicity\ns = 0 can also propagate at light-speed [14]. Gravitational waves with scalar polarization\nare predicted by the most common generalizations of GR such as scalar-tensor theories.\nBesides the classical example of Brans-Dicke theory [15], scalar-tensor theories result in the\nlow-energy limit of string theory (see, e.g., [16]). Modifications of the Einstein-Hilbert action, which consider generic functions of the Ricci scalar in the Lagrangian (f(R) theories),\nalso predict \"scalar\" gravitational waves [17]. Vector modes, on the other hand, can appear\nin the so-called \"quadratic gravity\" formulations [17], and in the context of theories in which\nthe graviton has a finite mass such as the Visser theory [18].\nLISA will not be able to distinguish the propagation speeds of scalar (helicity s = 0)\nand vector (helicity s = \u00b11) polarizations from the speed of light (a result following, as we\nshall see below, from a combination of the existing stringent upper limits on the mass of\nthe graviton [19\u201321] and the LISA observational bandwidth). However, it should be able\nto assess the polarizations of the observed gravitational wave signals. Since the accuracy\nby which LISA will distinguish one polarization from another will depend on their signalto-noise ratios [22], in this paper we estimate the LISA sensitivities to scalar- and vectorpolarized wave.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section (II) we derive the one-way Doppler response\nto a gravitational wave signal characterized by six polarizations (2 \"tensor\" (helicity s = \u00b12),\n2 \"vector\" (helicity s = \u00b11), and 2 \"scalar\" (helicity s = 0)). Since the resulting expression\nis equal in form to the one previously derived by Estabrook and Wahlquist [23] for tensor\nwaves (i.e. for waves predicted by General Relativity), we conclude that the responses of the\nvarious time-delay interferometric (TDI) combinations are also identical in form to those\npreviously derived within the framework of GR [24]. Although the derivation of the response\nfunction of a Michelson interferometer to non-tensor polarization modes has been considered\nin previous publications [10, 25], the expression presented there was correct in the so called\n\"long-wavelength-limit\", i.e. when the wavelength of the GW is much larger than the size of\nthe detector. Since LISA will be sensitive, over most of its observational frequency band, to\n3\n\n\fGWs of wavelength shorter than its linear size, we have derived the expressions of the LISA\nTDI responses to vector- and scalar- waves that are valid for any wavelength. In Section\n(III) we then compute the LISA sensitivities to vector and scalar waves. We find that (i)\nat frequencies larger then the inverse of the one-way light time (\u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22122 Hz) LISA is\nten-times more sensitive to scalar-longitudinal and vector signals than to tensor and scalartransverse waves, while (ii) it is equally sensitive to tensor and vector waves, and somewhat\nless sensitive to scalar signals in the low part of its frequency band. Although both these\nresults might seem surprising at first, we show that they are consequence of the physical and\ngeometrical properties of the vector and scalar waves and how they affect the frequency of\nthe light beams exchanged by the three LISA spacecraft. Finally in Section (IV) we present\na summary of the paper and our concluding remarks. Throughout the paper we will be\nusing natural units ( c = G = h = 1) except where mentioned otherwise.\n\nII.\n\nDERIVATION OF THE ONE-WAY DOPPLER RESPONSE\n\nIn what follows we present the derivation of the \"one-way\" Doppler response to a gravitational wave signal predicted by the most general relativistic metric theory of gravity [13].\nAlthough the result has already appeared in the literature [26], our derivation results into an\nexpression that is compact and identical in form to that first obtained by Wahlquist [27] in\nthe case of plane gravitational waves predicted by GR. This of course simplifies significantly\nthe derivation of the LISA TDI responses as they turn out to be equal in form to those\ngiven in [24]. As in [23, 27], our derivation is general and does not rely on any assumptions\nabout the size of the wavelength of the radiation relative to the size of the detector.\nLet us consider a space-time with the following metric\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + (\u03b4ij + hij (vt \u2212 z))dxi dxj , |hij | << 1,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the usual sum convention over repeated indices is assumed, Latin indices go from\n1 to 3, and a plane- gravitational wave has been assumed, without loss of generality, to\npropagate along an arbitrary +z direction. In Eq. (1) we have allowed the wave to travel\nat a finite speed (group velocity) v < 1 to account for a possible non-zero mass of the\ngraviton. Working in the context of GR, it is well know that hij has two degrees of freedom\nrepresenting gravitational waves (GWs) with helicity s = \u00b12, and v = 1. On the other\n4\n\n\fhand, alternative relativistic metric theories of gravity allow for GWs with up to six degrees\nof freedom [13]. Therefore, in the most general case, hij can be represented in terms of six\ncomponents (with corresponding six metric amplitudes) in the following form [13]\nhij (vt \u2212 z) =\n\n6\nX\n\n(r)\n\n\u000fij h(r) (vt \u2212 z) ,\n\n(2)\n\nr=1\n(r)\n\nwhere \u000fij are the six polarization tensors associated with the six waveforms of the gravitational wave signal. If we introduce a set of Cartesian orthogonal coordinates (x, y, z)\nassociated with the wave, in which (x, y) are in the plane of the wave and z is along the\ndirection of propagation of the wave and orthogonal to the (x, y) plane, the above six polarization tensors assume the following matricial form [13]\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0 1\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \u0002 \u0003\n\u0002 (1) \u0003\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u000f ij = \uf8ec 0 0 0 \uf8f7 \u000f(2) ij = \uf8ec 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n1 0 0\n0 0 1\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \u0002 \u0003\n\uf8ec\n\u0002 (3) \u0003\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 (4)\n\uf8ec\n\u000f ij = \uf8ec 0 0 1 \uf8f7 \u000f ij = \uf8ec 0 \u22121 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n0 0 0\n0 1 0\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(3)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \u0002 \u0003\n\uf8f7\n\u0002 (5) \u0003\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 (6)\n\uf8f7\n\u000f ij = \uf8ec 1 0 0 \uf8f7 \u000f ij = \uf8ec 0 1 0 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f8\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\nFrom the above expressions it is easy to verify that the tensors \u000f(a) , a = 1, ...., 6 are linearly\nindependent and form an orthogonal basis. In our notation we have labeled 4 and 5 the\nusual + and \u00d7 polarizations respectively (the tensor polarization waveforms). The vector\npolarizations (s = \u00b11) were labeled as 2 and 3, and finally the two scalar modes (s = 0)\nhave been denoted with the labels 1 (for the longitudinal scalar polarization) and 6 (for the\ntransversal scalar mode).\nFollowing [23, 28] we may notice that the space-time described by the metric of Eq. (1)\nallows for the following three Killing vectors\n\u03c1\nK(1)\n= \u03b4x\u03c1 ,\n\n\u03c1\nK(2)\n= \u03b4y\u03c1 ,\n\n5\n\n\u03c1\nK(3)\n= \u03b4z\u03c1 +\n\n\u03b4t\u03c1\n.\nv\n\n(4)\n\n\fGenerally speaking, in the weak field regime of a generic metric theory of gravity, GWs can\ntravel with v \u2264 1. In that case the linearized field equations are Klein-Gordon-type, and the\nresulting group velocity is determined by the mass of the graviton, m. Remembering that\n\u221a\nv = \u2202\u03c9/\u2202k, and that the dispersion relation is equal to k = \u03c9 2 \u2212 m2 , we find the following\nexpression for v in terms of m and \u03c9\nr\nv(\u03c9) =\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0010 m \u00112\n\u03c9\n\n.\n\n(5)\n\nSince the operational frequency band of LISA will be within the range (10\u22124 \u2212 1 Hz), by\nassuming presently known upper-limits for the mass of the graviton from Eq. (5) we obtain\nthe resulting values for the group velocity of these waves. After restoring physical units and\ntaking m < 10\u221259 g (the most stringent constraint to date obtained by requiring the derived\ndynamical properties of a galactic disk to be consistent with observations [21]), at 10\u22124 Hz\nwe find a value for the group velocity v whose fractional difference, \u2206v , from the speed of\nlight is equal to: \u2206v = |v \u2212 c|/c ' 10\u221215 . A less stringent value for the mass of the graviton\nequal to m < 7.68\u00d710\u221255 g (obtained from solar-system dynamics observations [19]), results\ninto a \u2206v ' 10\u22128 . These considerations imply that, no matter whether we are conservative\nor not in our assumption about a likely upper limit for the graviton mass, LISA will not\nbe able to resolve the propagation speeds of the different polarization components of the\ndetected GWs by resolving the time-separations of their imprints in the TDI combinations\n[24]. For this reason, from now on, we will assume v = 1 in natural units, and rewrite the\n\u03c1\nthird Killing vector K(3) as K(3)\n= \u03b4z\u03c1 + \u03b4t\u03c1 .\n\nLet us now consider the unit vector n\u0302 along the Doppler link and oriented from spacecraft\n1 to 2 (see Fig. 1). If we denote with (\u03b8, \u03c6) the usual polar angles, n\u0302 assumes the following\nfamiliar form\nn\u03c1 = sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 \u03b4x\u03c1 + sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6 \u03b4y\u03c1 + cos \u03b8 \u03b4z\u03c1 .\n\n(6)\n\nSince the most general Killing vector of our metric can be written as a linear combination\nof the three Killing vectors above\nK \u03c1 = a1 \u03b4x\u03c1 + a2 \u03b4y\u03c1 + a3 (\u03b4z\u03c1 + \u03b4t\u03c1 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith a1 , a2 , a3 constants, by comparing Eq. (6) and Eq. (7) we note that by taking\n(a1 , a2 , a3 ) = C n\u0302, Eq. (7) becomes\nK \u03c1 = C[n\u03c1 + k\u0302 * n\u0302 \u03b4t\u03c1 ] ,\n6\n\n(8)\n\n\fz\nk\u0302\n\n2\n0\n\nn\u0302\nL\n\n1\n\ny\n\n0\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: A laser beam of nominal frequency \u03bd0 is transmitted from spacecraft 1 to spacecraft 2 and\nsimultaneously another beam from spacecraft 2 is transmitted back to 1. The gravitational wave\ntrain propagates along the z direction, and the two polar angles (\u03b8, \u03c6) describe the direction of\npropagation of the laser beams relative to the wave. See text for a complete description.\n\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant, and k\u0302 is the unit vector along the direction of propagation\nof the wave (see Figure 1).\nIf we now consider the 4-momentum of a photon transmitted by spacecraft 1, its analytic\nexpression can be written in terms of the metric perturbation at spacecraft 1 in the following\nway [23, 28]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nt\n\u03be\nP\u03c1 = \u03bd0 \u2212\u03b4\u03c1 + n\u03c1 + h\u03c1\u03be n\n,\n2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere it is easy to see that the condition P\u03c1 P \u03c1 = 0 is fulfilled to first order in the metric\nperturbation hij . Since P\u03c1 K \u03c1 = constant along the photon world line [23, 28], we obtain\nthe following relationship between the frequency of the photon emitted at spacecraft 1, \u03bd0 ,\n\n7\n\n\fand that received at spacecraft 2, \u03bd 0\nP\u03c1 K \u03c1 = P\u03c10 K 0\u03c1 ,\n(10)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 0 0\u03be\n1\n\u03c1\n\u03be\n\u03c1\n0\nt\n0\nt\n\u03bd0 \u2212\u03b4\u03c1 + n\u03c1 + h\u03c1\u03be n (n + k\u0302 * n\u0302\u03b4t ) = \u03bd \u2212\u03b4\u03c1 + n\u03c1 + h\u03c1\u03be n (n0\u03c1 + k\u0302 * n\u03020 \u03b4t\u03c1 ) . (11)\n2\n2\n0\u03c1\n\u03c1\n\u03c1\nIf we now rewrite n = n + \u03b4n , we may notice that, to first order in hij , n\u03c1 \u03b4n\u03c1 = 0 because\nn0\u03c1 n\u03c1 = n\u03c1 n\u03c1 = 1. This result, together with Eq.(11) above, allows us to derive the following\nexpression for the ratio of the two frequencies \u03bd 0 and \u03bd0\n1 \u2212 k\u0302 * n\u0302 + 21 n\u03c1 h\u03c1\u03be n\u03be\n\u03bd0\n=\n.\n\u03bd0\n1 \u2212 k\u0302 * n\u0302 + 21 n\u03c1 h0\u03c1\u03be n\u03be\n\n(12)\n\nFinally, expanding the right-hand-side of the last equation to first order in h\u03c1\u03be we get the\nresulting expression for the one-way Doppler response, y\ny = (1 + k\u0302 * n\u0302) (\u03a8 \u2212 \u03a80 )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere y(t) \u2261 (\u03bd 0 (t) \u2212 \u03bd0 )/\u03bd0 , and \u03a8(t) is equal to\n\u03a8(t) \u2261\n\nni hij (t) nj\n2[1 \u2212 (k\u0302 * n\u0302)2 ]\n\n(14)\n\nBy explicitly showing the time dependence of the various terms, y(t) can be rewritten in the\nfollowing form [24]\nh\n\ni\ny(t) = (1 + k\u0302 * n\u0302) \u03a8(t \u2212 L) \u2212 \u03a8(t \u2212 k\u0302 * n\u0302L)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere L is the separation between the two spacecraft. Note that, in order to obtain the\nabove expression, we have only assumed the time-components of the metric perturbation,\nh\u03c1t to be equal to zero [13].\nThe expression for the one-way Doppler response measured on board spacecraft 1 at time\nt can be obtained from Eq. (15) by changing n\u0302 \u2192 \u2212n\u0302, and further delaying the waveforms\nby k\u0302 * n\u0302 L. The resulting one-way Doppler response, y 0 (t), is equal to\nh\ni\ny 0 (t) = (1 \u2212 k\u0302 * n\u0302) \u03a8(t \u2212 (1 + k\u0302 * n\u0302)L) \u2212 \u03a8(t)\n\n(16)\n\nSince the above expressions of the one-way Doppler responses are identical in form to\nthose valid for tensor waves [27], it follows that the various TDI combinations of the LISA\nsix inter-spacecraft one-way Doppler measurements will also be identical in form to those\nderived in [24]. For these reasons they will not be given here, and we refer the reader to\n[24, 29, 30] for more details.\n8\n\n\fIII.\n\nLISA SENSITIVITIES\n\nIn this section we will compute the LISA TDI sensitivities to vector and scalar waves.\nAlthough the LISA sensitivities to tensor waves have already been presented in an earlier\npublication [31], for sake of comparison we will include them in the sensitivity plots presented\nin this section. We will specialize our calculations to the equilateral-triangle configuration:\narmlength 1 = armlength 2 = armlength 3 = L (L ' 16.7 light seconds) since the LISA\narm lengths will differ by at most a few percent, and any corrections to our results will be\nto this level of accuracy [24, 30, 31].\nThe LISA sensitivity to tensor GWs has been traditionally taken to be equal to (on\naverage over the sky and polarization states) the strength of a sinusoidal GW required to\nachieve a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in a one-year integration time, as a function of Fourier\nfrequency. Although in the case of vector waves the average over the polarization states can\nbe performed by implementing the same procedure described in [24, 31] for tensor waves,\nin general this can not be done for scalar waves. This is because the two scalar fields are\nmutually orthogonal (and independent), as one is purely longitudinal and the other purely\ntransverse to the direction of propagation of the wave.\nIn order to compute the LISA sensitivities we will use the following expressions for the\npower spectra of the noises affecting the X, \u03b1, \u03b6, E, P , and U combinations [31] (see Figure\n(2))\n\nSX (f ) = [8 sin2 (4\u03c0f L) + 32 sin2 (2\u03c0f L)]Sypm (f ) + 16 sin2 (2\u03c0f L) Syop (f )\n\n(17)\n\nS\u03b1 (f ) = [8 sin2 (3\u03c0f L) + 16 sin2 (\u03c0f L)]Sypm (f ) + 6 Syop (f )\n\n(18)\n\nS\u03b6 (f ) = 24 sin2 (\u03c0f L) Sypm (f ) + 6 Syop (f )\n\n(19)\n\nSE (f ) = [32 sin2 (\u03c0f L) + 8 sin2 (2\u03c0f L)]Sypm (f ) + [8 sin2 (\u03c0f L)\n+ 8 sin2 (2\u03c0f L)] Syop (f )\n\n(20)\n\nSP (f ) = [8 sin2 (2\u03c0f L) + 32 sin2 (\u03c0f L)]Sypm (f ) + [8 sin2 (2\u03c0f L)\n+ 8 sin2 (\u03c0f L)] Syop (f )\n\n(21)\n\nSU (f ) = [16 sin2 (\u03c0f L) + 8 sin2 (2\u03c0f L) + 16 sin2 (3\u03c0f L)]Sypm (f )\n+ [4 sin2 (\u03c0f L) + 8 sin2 (2\u03c0f L) + 4 sin2 (3\u03c0f L)] Syop (f ) ,\n\n9\n\n(22)\n\n\f\u221235\n\n10\n\n\u221236\n\n10\n\n\u221237\n\nNoise Power Spectra ( Hz\u22121)\n\n10\n\n\u221238\n\n10\n\n\u221239\n\n10\n\n\u221240\n\n10\n\nX\n\u221241\n\n10\n\nU\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u221242\n\n10\n\nE and P\n\n\u221243\n\n10\n\n\u03b6\n\u221244\n\n10\n\n\u22124\n\n10\n\n\u22123\n\n10\n\n\u22122\n\n10\nf(Hz)\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFIG. 2: Noise spectra in the X, \u03b1, \u03b6, E, P , and U time-delay interferometric combinations\naccounting for the nominal proof-mass and optical path noises. The varying depths of the minima\nin the high-frequency ranges of X, E, and P is an artifact of numerically calculating these functions\nat discrete frequencies\n\nwhere Sypm (f ) = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221248 [f /1Hz]\u22122 Hz\u22121 is the spectrum of the relative frequency\nfluctuations due to each proof mass, and Syop (f ) = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u221237 [f /1Hz]2 Hz\u22121 is the spectrum\nof optical path (mainly shot and beam pointing) noise. Both these noises can be regarded\nas the main limiting noise sources for LISA [7, 31].\nGravitational wave sensitivity is the wave amplitude required to achieve a given signal-tonoise ratio. We calculate it in the conventional way, requiring a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in a\np\none year integration time: 5 Sk (f ) B/(root-mean-squared gravitational wave response for\ndata combination k), where k is X, \u03b1, \u03b6, E, P , U , and Sk is the total noise power spectrum\nfor TDI combination k. The bandwidth, B, was taken to be equal to one cycle/year (i.e.\n3.17 \u00d7 10\u22128 Hz).\nWe have assumed the vector-waves to be elliptically polarized and monochromatic, with\ntheir wave functions, (h(2) , h(3) ), written in terms of a nominal wave amplitude, H, and the\n\n10\n\n\ftwo Poincar\u00e9 parameters, (\u03a6, \u0393), in the following way\nh(2) (t) = H sin(\u0393) sin(\u03c9t + \u03a6) ,\n\n(23)\n\nh(3) (t) = H cos(\u0393) sin(\u03c9t) .\n\n(24)\n\nFor scalar signals instead, the two wave functions, (h(1) , h(6) ), have been treated as independent and we calculated the TDI sensitivities to each of these two polarizations. For both\nvector and scalar signals we averaged over source direction by assuming uniform distribution\nof the sources over the celestial sphere; in the case of vector signals we also averaged over\nelliptical polarization states uniformly distributed on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere for each source\ndirection. The averaging was done via Monte Carlo integration with 4000 source position/polarization state pairs per Fourier frequency bin and 7000 Fourier bins across the\nLISA (10\u22124 \u2212 1) Hz band [24, 31].\nFigure (3) shows the root-mean-squared (r.m.s.) responses of the TDI combinations (a)\nX (unequal-arm Michelson), (b) \u03b1 (Sagnac), (c) \u03b6 (symmetrized Sagnac), (d) E (monitor),\n(e) P (beacon), and (f) U (relay) to tensor (already derived in [24] and shown here for\ncomparison), vector and scalar gravitational waves. In the high-part of the LISA frequency\nband we may notice that the r.m.s. responses to vector and scalar-longitudinal waves are\nsignificantly larger than those to tensor and scalar-transverse signals. In particular, the\nscalar-longitudinal r.m.s. response grows with the frequency at a much faster rate than the\nothers.\nIn order to physically understand this effect, let us compare a one-way Doppler response\n(that measured on board spacecraft 1, for instance) to a \"pulse\" tensor wave against that due\nto a scalar-longitudinal pulse wave. A tensor signal propagating orthogonally to the light\nbeam (direction for which the one-way Doppler response can reach its maximum magnitude\nin this case) will only interact with the light for the brief instance its wavefront crosses the\nlight beam. On the other hand, if a scalar-longitudinal wave propagates along the direction\nbetween the two spacecraft (over which the Doppler response will achieve its maximum in\nthis case) the frequency of the light will be affected by the gravitational wave for the entire\ntime L it takes the wave to propagate from one spacecraft to the other, resulting into an\namplification of the frequency shift when the wavelength of the wave is shorter than the\ninter-spacecraft distance, L. The above considerations become apparent by considering in\nboth cases the one-way Doppler response y 0 in the Fourier domain. For a tensor signal, the\n11\n\n\fmodulus-squared of the Fourier transform of Eq. (16) with k\u0302 * n\u0302 \u2192 0 becomes equal to\n|ye0 (f )k\u0302*n\u0302\u21920 |2 = sin2 (\u03c0f L) |e\nh(f )|2 ,\n\n(25)\n\nwith e\nh\u2261e\nh(4) cos(2\u03c6) + e\nh(5) sin(2\u03c6). In the case of a scalar-longitudinal signal instead, it is\neasy to show that, in the limit of k\u0302 * n\u0302 \u2192 \u22121 the modulus-squared of the Fourier transform\nof Eq. (16) becomes equal to\n|ye0 (f )k\u0302*n\u0302\u2192\u22121 |2 = (\u03c0f L)2 |e\nh(1) (f )|2 .\n\n(26)\n\nFrom the above two expressions we may conclude that, at frequencies larger than the inverse\nof the one-way-light-time and for tensor and scalar-longitudinal waves of comparable amplitudes, the maximum one-way Doppler response to a scalar-longitudinal signal will be larger\nthan the corresponding maximum response to a tensor wave by roughly a factor of \u03c0f L.\nThis example implies that the r.m.s. of the TDI responses to scalar-longitudinal signals will\nbe larger than those to tensor waves in the high-frequency region of the LISA band. Similar\nconsiderations can be made for understanding the differences between the r.m.s. responses\nto tensor and vector waves.\nIn the low-frequency limit (for f < 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 Hz) the tensor and vector r.m.s. responses\ncoincide, while those for the two scalars also coincide with each other but are smaller by\na factor of about 2 than those for tensor and vector waves. This is because the two scalar\nwaves, being mutually orthogonal, have been treated as independent rather than elliptically\npolarized like the vector and tensor waves.\nIn Figure (4) we then plot the corresponding sensitivities of the TDI combinations to the\ntensor, vector and the two scalar polarization components. The characteristic behavior of\nthe r.m.s. responses to scalar-longitudinal and vector signals shown in figure (3) folds into\nthe plots presented here. At high-frequencies the sensitivity to scalar-longitudinal waves is\nsignificantly better than that to tensor, vector, and scalar-transverse waves. At 1 Hz, for\ninstance, the sensitivity of scalar-longitudinal signals is about a factor of f L ' 17 better\nthan that to tensor waves, while it is only a factor of 3 better than the sensitivity to vector\nsignals.\nAnother interesting feature noticeable in Figure (4) is the lack of sensitivity of the Sagnac\ncombinations (b) \u03b1 and (c) \u03b6 to scalar-transverse waves at frequencies equal to integermultiples of the inverse of the one-way-light-time.
