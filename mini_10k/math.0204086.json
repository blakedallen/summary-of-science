A problem of Tur\u00e1n\nThe following question is attributed to Tur\u00e1n:\n(Tur\u00e1n) Let \u03a9 be a convex\ndomain in Rd which is symmetric with respect to 0.\nR\nWhat is the maximum of f for all f supported in \u03a9 which are positive definite (their\nFourier Transform is nonnegative) and have f (0) = 1?\nSee [1, 3, 11] for the history of the problem.\nDefinition 1 (Tur\u00e1n domains)\nR\nA symmetric convex domain \u03a9 is called a Tur\u00e1n domain if the maximum of f over all positive definite\nfunctions supported in \u03a9 and with f (0) = 1, is achieved by the function\nf=\n\n2d\n\u03c7 1 \u2217 \u03c7 1 \u03a9.\n2\n|\u03a9| 2 \u03a9\n\n(1)\n\n\u2217\nThe second author was supported in part by the Hungarian National Foundation for Scientific Research, Grant\n# T034531 and T 032872.\n\n1\n\n\fOtherwise it is called a non-Tur\u00e1n domain.\nThe function f in the above definition is clearly a legitimate function, as its Fourier Transform\n(FT) is\n2\n2d\nfb =\n\u03c7d\n1\n\u03a9\n|\u03a9| 2\nand f (0) = 1. The integral of f in this case is 2\u2212d |\u03a9|.\nNon-Tur\u00e1n domains are not known to exist.\nWe cite the recent papers by Arestov and Berdysheva [1] and by Gorbachev [3]. In [1] it is\nproved that the regular hexagon in the plane is a Tur\u00e1n domain and in [3] that the Euclidean ball\nin d-dimensional space is also one. We find it very likely that there are no non-Tur\u00e1n domains.\nRemark. This problem is only interesting for symmetric domains as the support of any positive\ndefinite function is always a symmetric set. The convexity assumption on the domain also cannot\nbe removed if the function f in (1) is to be supported in \u03a9.\n\n\u00a71. A problem of Fuglede\nOur interest in this problem of Tur\u00e1n arose in connection with a conjecture of Fuglede which\nwe now describe.\nDefinition 2 (Translational tiles)\nA measurable set \u03a9 \u2286 Rd is a translational tile if there exists a set \u039b \u2286 Rd such that almost all\n(Lebesgue) points in Rd belong to exactly one of the translates\n\u03a9 + \u03bb,\n\n\u03bb \u2208 \u039b.\n\nWe denote this condition by \u03a9 + \u039b = Rd .\nIf f \u2208 L1 (Rd ) is nonnegative we say that f tiles with \u039b at level l if\nX\nf (x \u2212 \u03bb) = l, a.e. x.\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nWe denote this latter condition by f + \u039b = lRd .\nIn any tiling the translation set has some properties of density, which hold uniformly in space.\nDefinition 3 (Uniform density)\nA multiset \u039b \u2286 Rd has (uniform) density \u03c1 if\nlim\n\nR\u2192\u221e\n\n#(\u039b \u2229 BR (x))\n\u2192\u03c1\n|BR (x)|\n\nuniformly in x \u2208 Rd . We write \u03c1 = dens \u039b.\nWe say that \u039b has (uniformly) bounded density if the fraction above is bounded by a constant \u03c1 uniformly\nfor x \u2208 R and R > 1. We say then that \u039b has density (uniformly) bounded by \u03c1.\n2\n\n\fRemark. It is not hard to prove (see for example [7], Lemma 2.3, where it is proved in dimension\none \u2013 the proof\nextends verbatim to higher dimension) that in any tiling f + \u039b = lRd the set \u039b has\nR\ndensity l/ f .\nLet \u03a9 be a measurable subset of Rd and \u039b be a discrete subset of Rd . We write\ne\u03bb (x) = exp 2\u03c0ih\u03bb, xi,\n\n(x \u2208 Rd ),\n\nE\u039b = {e\u03bb : \u03bb \u2208 \u039b} \u2282 L2 (\u03a9).\nThe inner product and norm on L2 (\u03a9) are\nZ\nZ\n2\nf g, and kf k\u03a9 =\n|f |2 .\nhf, gi\u03a9 =\n\u03a9\n\n\u03a9\n\nDefinition 4 (Spectrum of a domain, spectral pairs)\nThe pair (\u03a9, \u039b) is called a spectral pair if E\u039b is an orthogonal basis for L2 (\u03a9). A set \u03a9 will be called\nspectral if there is \u039b \u2282 Rd such that (\u03a9, \u039b) is a spectral pair. The set \u039b is then called a spectrum of \u03a9.\nExample: If Qd = (\u22121/2, 1/2)d is the cube of unit volume in Rd then (Qd , Zd ) is a spectral pair,\nas is well known by the ordinary L2 theory of multiple Fourier series.\nThe following conjecture is still unresolved, in all dimensions and both directions.\nConjecture 1 (Fuglede [2]) Let \u03a9 \u2282 Rd be a bounded open set. Then \u03a9 is spectral if and only if\nthere exists L \u2282 Rd such that \u03a9 + L = Rd is a tiling.\nNote that in Fuglede's Conjecture no relation is claimed between the translation set L and the\nspectrum \u039b. This Conjecture is still open for all dimensions. However (see [2, 8]), the lattice case\nof this conjecture is easy to show. In the following result the dual lattice \u039b\u2217 of a lattice \u039b is defined\nas usual by\nn\no\n\u039b\u2217 = x \u2208 Rd : \u2200\u03bb \u2208 \u039b hx, \u03bbi \u2208 Z .\nTheorem A (Fuglede [2]) The bounded, open domain \u03a9 admits translational tilings by a lattice \u039b\nif and only if E\u039b\u2217 is an orthogonal basis for L2 (\u03a9).\n\n\u00a72. Connecting the problems of Tur\u00e1n and Fuglede\nOur main result is the following.\nTheorem 1 Let \u03a9 \u2286 Rd be a symmetric convex domain. If \u03a9 is spectral, then it has to be a Tur\u00e1n\ndomain as well.\nIt follows that convex spectral domains are Tur\u00e1n domains. Indeed, convex spectral domains\nare necessarily symmetric according to the result in [8], and so the above Theorem 1 applies.\nCorollary 1 Suppose the symmetric convex domain \u03a9 \u2286 Rd is a translational tile. Then it is a\nTur\u00e1n domain.\n3\n\n\fProof of Corollary 1. We start with the following result which claims that every convex tile is also\na lattice tile.\nTheorem B (Venkov [13] and McMullen [12]) Suppose that a convex body K tiles space by\ntranslation. Then it is necessarily a symmetric polytope and there is a lattice L such that\nK + L = Rd .\nA complete characterization of the tiling polytopes is also among the conclusions of the VenkovMcMullen Theorem but we do not need it here and choose not to give the full statement as it would\nrequire some more definitions.\nSo, if a convex domain is a tile, it is also a lattice tile, hence spectral by Theorem A, and as\nsuch it is Tur\u00e1n, by Theorem 1.\n\u2737\nRemark. If one wants to avoid using the Venkov-McMullen theorem in the proof of Corollary 1 one\nshould enhance the assumption of Corollary 1 to state that \u03a9 is a lattice tile.\nThe result of [1] about the hexagon being a Tur\u00e1n domain is thus a special case of our Corollary\n1, but not the result in [3] about the ball being Tur\u00e1n. The ball [4], and essentially every smooth\nconvex body [5], is known not to be spectral, in accordance with Conjecture 1.\nFuglede's Conjecture for convex domains is still open except for dimension d = 2, in which case\nit was answered in the affirmative recently, see [6]. Thus our Theorem 1 conceivably (though not\nvery likely) applies to a wider class of convex domains than just convex tiles, dealt with in Corollary\n1.\nProof of Theorem 1. The proof of our main theorem relies on Fourier theoretic characterizations of\ntranslational tiling [8]. Without loss of generality let us assume from now on that \u03a9 has volume 1.\nLet \u03a9 have spectrum \u039b \u2286 Rd . This is equivalent to the following (see [8])\nX\n|\u03c7\nc\u03a9 |2 (x \u2212 \u03bb) = 1, for a.e. x \u2208 Rd .\n\n(2)\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u039b\n\nThat is, |\u03c7\nc\u03a9 |2 tiles Rd with translation set \u039b at level 1, i.e. |\u03c7\nc\u03a9 |2 + \u039b = Rd . It follows (see the\nRemark after Definition 3) that dens \u039b = 1/|\u03a9| = 1.\n\nd\nFor any\nP given \u039b \u2282 R with bounded density (see Definition 3) we denote by \u03b4\u039b the (infinite)\nmeasure \u03bb\u2208\u039b \u03b4\u03bb . This is a tempered distribution, as the total mass in a ball of radius R grows\npolynomially with R, and therefore we can speak of its FT.\n\nWe shall use the following result from [8].\nLemma 1 (Kolountzakis [8]) Suppose that f \u2265 0 is not identically 0, that f \u2208 L1 (Rd ), fb \u2265 0\nhas compact support and \u039b \u2282 Rd . If f + \u039b is a tiling then\nn\no\nd\nb\nsupp \u03b4c\n(3)\n\u039b \u2286 x \u2208 R : f (x) = 0 \u222a {0}.\nWhen applied to our case, f = |\u03c7\nc\u03a9 |2 and fb = \u03c7\u03a9 \u2217 \u03c7\u03a9 , and it follows that\nc\nc\nsupp \u03b4c\n\u039b \u2286 {0} \u222a (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9) = {0} \u222a (2\u03a9) .\n\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\fThe necessary support condition (3) in Lemma 1 cannot by itself guarantee that f tiles with\n\u039b. The reason is that a tempered distribution, such as \u03b4c\n\u039b , which is supported in the zero-set of a\nfunction, is not necessarily killed when multiplied by that function. One has to know some extra\ninformation about the order of the distribution (\"what order derivatives it involves\") versus the\ndegree of vanishing of the function on the support of the distribution1 .\nIn the following partial converse to Lemma 1 (see [8]), this problem is solved as the separation\nof the supports guarantees infinite order of vanishing of f .\nLemma 2 (Kolountzakis [8]) Suppose that g \u2208 L1 (Rd ), and that \u039b \u2282 Rd has uniformly bounded\ndensity. Suppose also that O \u2282 Rd is open, that2\nZ\ng(0) = g 6= 0,\nb\n(5)\n\nand that for some \u03b4 > 0\n\nsupp \u03b4c\ng = 0}.\n\u039b \\ {0} \u2286 O and O + B\u03b4 (0) \u2286 {b\n\n(6)\n\nThen g + \u039b is a tiling at level gb(0) * \u03b4c\n\u039b ({0}).\n\nThe conlusion of Lemma 2 demands some explanation. Conditions (5) and (6) imply that in\na neighborhood of 0 the tempered distribution \u03b4c\ng is\n\u039b is supported at 0 only. That's because b\ncontinuous and, since gb(0) 6= 0, it does not vanish in some neighborhood of 0. It then follows that,\nnear 0, \u03b4c\n\u039b is not only a tempered distribution but a measure, that is, it is just a point mass at 0\n(see [7], Theorem 5.1, Step 1, for the proof in dimension 1, which works in any dimension). For\nthis reason it makes sense to write \u03b4c\n\u039b ({0}) for that point mass.\n\nFrom Lemma 3 below, it follows that the value of this constant is precisely the density of \u039b, if\nsuch a density exists.\n\nLemma 3 (Kolountzakis [9])\nP\nSuppose that \u039b \u2208 Rd is a multiset with density \u03c1, \u03b4\u039b = \u03bb\u2208\u039b \u03b4\u03bb , and that \u03b4c\n\u039b is a measure in a\nc\nneighborhood of 0. Then \u03b4\u039b ({0}) = \u03c1.\nConclusion of Proof of Theorem 1. If \u03a9 is of non-Tur\u00e1n\ntype, then there exists a positive definite\nR\n\u2212d\nfunction F supported in \u03a9 with F (0) = 1 and F > 2 .\nNow define\n\n\u0013\n1+\u01eb\nx ,\n2\nR\nb > 1. It follows that supp G\nb \u2286 (1 \u2212 \u03b8)2\u03a9, for\nwhere \u01eb > 0 is to be taken so small that we have G\nb is also positive definite.\nsome \u03b8 > 0.

First let us observe the following simple\nfact.\nLemma 4 Let 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2. Then for any bounded convex domain \u03a9 with 0 \u2208 \u03a9 we have\ndist{\u03b1\u03a9, (\u03b2\u03a9)c } = r(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1), where r := dist{0, \u03a9c } = max{\u03c1 : B\u03c1 \u2286 \u03a9} is the inradius of \u03a9.\nThus we have dist {O, (1 \u2212 \u03b8)2\u03a9} = \u03b8r by the above Lemma, hence for any \u03b4 < \u03b8r we have\nc\nO + B\u03b4 \u2282 ((1 \u2212 \u03b8)2\u03a9)c . On\n\u0011 hand, dist {(2 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03a9, (2\u03a9) } = \u03b8r > 0 again by the above\n\u0010 the other\n\nLemma and thus (2\u03a9)c \u2282 (2 \u2212 \u03b8)\u03a9\n\nc\n\n= O.\n\nc\nThat is, by (4), supp \u03b4c\n\u039b \\ {0} \u2286 (2\u03a9) \u2282 O. With these the condition (6) is seen to be fulfilled\nb = 0} \u2287 ((1 \u2212 \u03b8)2\u03a9)c since supp G\nb \u2286 (1 \u2212 \u03b8)2\u03a9.\nby g = G, as {b\ng = 0} = {G\n\nb\nb Thus\nNote that (5) is also satisfied here as gb(0) = G(0)\n= F (0) = 1 by the definition of G.\nTheorem 5 can be applied and we find that G tiles Rd with translation set \u039b at level b\ng(0)\u03b4c\n\u039b {(0)} =\nb\nb\nG(0)dens \u039b by Theorem 6. Here G(0) = 1 and also dens \u039b = 1 in view of the considerations\nR next\nb > 1,\nto formula (2). Thus the level of tiling by G and \u039b is found to be 1. However, G(0) = G\nd\nhence the continuous nonnegative function G can not tile R at level 1. This contradiction proves\nthat there is no function F with the given properties as supposed at the outset. That is, \u03a9 is a\nTur\u00e1n domain.\n\u2737\n1\n\nAn important special case is when one knows the distribution to be a measure, as is the case when \u039b is either\na lattice or fully periodic. In that case any vanishing of the function will do and the implication in Lemma 1 can\nessentially be reversed.\n2\nCondition (5) was mistakenly ommitted from [8]. This does not affect the validity of what's proved in [8] as the\ncondition (5) is easily seen to hold in the specific application.\n\n6\n\n\f\u00a73. Another proof that the ball is a Tur\u00e1n domain.\nHere we give a new proof, rather different from that in [3], that the ball is a Tur\u00e1n domain. Let\nB denote the unit ball in Rd . To say that the ball is Tur\u00e1n is to prove the inequality\nZ\nf \u2264 2\u2212d |B|f (0)\n(7)\nfor every positive definite f supported in B. By an easy approximation argument it is enough to\nprove (7) under the extra assumption that f is smooth. Noticing further that both sides of the\ninequality are linear functionals of f invariant under rotation, we can assume that f is radial by\nexamining the spherical average of f\nZ\nf (T x) dT\n\nthe integral being over T \u2208 On , the group of all orthogonal transformations equipped with Haar\nmeasure.\nThe key ingredient in the proof is the following result.\nTheorem C (Rudin [10])\nSuppose f is a radial smooth positive definite function with support in the ball B. Then f can be\nwritten as a uniformly convergent series\nf=\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=1\n\nfk \u2217 fek ,\n\n(fek (x) = fk (\u2212x)),\n\n(8)\n\nwith fk being smooth and supported in the half ball (1/2)B.\nNotice that for any integrable function g with support in the compact set K we have for f = g\u2217e\ng\nZ\n\nf\n\n=\n\u2264\n\u2264\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ng\n|g|2 |K|\n\n(Cauchy-Schwartz)\n\n|g|2 * 2\u2212d |K \u2212 K|\n\n(Brunn-Minkowski)\n\n= f (0) * 2\u2212d |K \u2212 K|.\nTaking K = (1/2)B we obtain for every fk in (8):\nZ\nfk \u2217 fek \u2264 2\u2212d |B|(fk \u2217 fek )(0).\n\nSumming the series we have (7) for f .\n\u2737\nBibliography\n\n7\n\n\f[1] V.V.
