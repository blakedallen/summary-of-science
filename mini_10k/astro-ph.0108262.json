We discuss the radio properties of this source and\ncompare them to those of other Type II radio supernovae.\nSubject headings: galaxies: individual (M 101) - galaxies: general - stars:\nsupernovae - stars: supernovae: individual (SN 1970G) - radio continuum:\nstars\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSN 1970G, a Type II supernova (SN) in M101 (Lovas 1970; Kirshner et al. 1973), was\nthe first SN to be detected in the radio (Gottesman et al. 1972; Allen et al. 1976). It then\nfaded from view (Weiler et al. 1986) until it was recovered again in 1990 (Cowan, Goss &\nSramek 1991; hereafter referred to as CGS). SN 1970G is one of a very rare group of SNe\nthat have been recovered in the radio more than a decade following maximum optical light\nand is now - 31 years after outburst - the longest monitored such object.\nIntermediate-age radio supernovae (RSNe) have been defined as having ages from\n\u223c 10\u2013100 years old (Cowan & Branch 1985), spanning the period well after the optical\nemission fades (usually about 2 years) and before the turn-on of radio emission from\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe supernova remnant (SNR). Chevalier (1984) proposes that synchrotron radiation\nis produced in the region of interaction between the ejected supernova shell and the\ncircumstellar shell that originated from the prior mass loss of the progenitor star. In such\nmodels the radio emission drops as the expanding shock wave propagates outward through\nthe surrounding and decreasingly dense circumstellar material (CSM). Radio emission from\nSNRs is normally observed long after the supernova phase. Such factors as the density of\nthe local interstellar medium affect the turn-on time in models such as those of Cowsik &\nSarkar (1984) based upon the Gull (1973) piston model. These models typically suggest a\nminimum of 100 years for the formation and brightening of an SNR. The intermediate-age\ntime period is, therefore, critical in understanding the later stages of stellar evolution.\nIn particular, the circumstellar mass-loss rate for the supernova progenitors is a crucial\ncomponent in the initiation and duration of radio emission in models, such as those of\nChevalier (1984).\nTo study this transition period from SN to SNR, we and others have attempted to detect\nradio emission from intermediate-age SNe. While there have been a number of unsuccessful\nsearches, a few supernovae have been detected in the radio more than a decade after\nexplosion [SNe 1923A, 1950B & 1957D in M83 (Cowan & Branch 1985; Cowan et al. 1994;\nEck et al. 1998), SN 1961V in NGC 1058 (Cowan et al. 1988; Stockdale et al. 2001), SN\n1968D in NGC 6946 (Hyman et al. 1995), and SN 1978K in NGC 1313 (Ryder et al. 1993)].\nOne of the motivations for these studies has been that individual decades-old supernovae,\nsuch as SN 1970G, can undergo abrupt and rapid changes in flux densities on a timescale\nof only a few years. Such variability was seen in the radio emission from SN 1980K, which\nabruptly dropped after ten years of slow decline (Weiler et al. 1992; Montes et al. 1998).\nAlso the radio luminosity from SN 1979C, after declining steadily for years, has flattened\nand become relatively constant, perhaps as a result of the supernova shock wave hitting a\ndenser region of the CSM (Montes et al. 2000). Observations also indicate that SN 1957D,\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nafter being relatively constant (\u223c 3 mJy), suddenly (in two years) faded below (< 1 mJy)\nthe level of an associated H II region (Cowan et al. 1994).\nIn this paper, we report new radio observations of SN 1970G, its current flux density\nand spectral index, and examine how its radio emission has varied during the time it has\nbeen monitored.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Results\n\nThe new Very Large Array3 (VLA) data on SN 1970G were taken from six observing\nruns. In the first three, SN 1970G was observed for 4.5 total hours on 4 and 6 November and\n3 December 2000, at 20 cm (1.425 GHz) using the VLA's most extended (A) configuration,\nwith a maximum baseline of 34 km. During the second group of observing runs, SN 1970G\nwas observed on 10 January 2001 with the VLA in its A configuration and on 5 and 21\nFebruary 2001 with VLA in its BnA configuration (maximum baseline of 24 km) at 6cm\n(4.860 GHz) for a total of 6.5 hours. These observations were done using the standard VLA\ncontinuum mode, obtaining a total of 100 MHz bandwidth in each of the two orthogonal\ncircular polarizations. The phase calibrator was J1400+621 and 3C286 was used to set the\nflux density scale. In all observations the pointing center was 14h 03m 00s and +54\u25e6 14\u2032 33\u2032\u2032\n(J2000), and flux densities for 3C286 were taken from Perley, Butler, & Zijlstra (2001).\nData were Fourier transformed and deconvolved using the CLEAN algorithm as\nimplemented in the AIPS routine IMAGR, with the Brigg's robustness parameter of 0,\nwhich minimizes the point-spread function while maximizing sensitivity. The 20 cm and\n6 cm observations of the region from 1990 were also re-analyzed using the same data\n3\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foun-\n\ndation operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nreduction procedures and inputs as were used on the current data. The re-calculated results\nare presented in Table 1.\nThe 6 cm observations were combined using the AIPS routine DBCON, and a final\n6 cm image was produced. The AIPS routine CONVL was used to correct for differences in\nthe beam size and shape since they were taken in different array configurations. The 6 cm\nconvolved beam size was set to be 1.\u2032\u2032 20 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 20.\nThe peak flux density and position for SN 1970G were estimated in three ways using\nthe AIPS routines IMFIT, JMFIT, and SLICE. SLICE produces a series of one dimensional\nplots of flux densities vs. position at constant right ascension and then at constant\ndeclination. The SLICE plots were examined for baseline offsets owing to the nearby H II\nregion, NGC 5455 [centered \u2243 5 sec from SN 1970G]. The results from the SLICE analysis\nare given in Table 1; the results from all three analysis methods agree to within the errors\nshown.\nThe position measured for SN 1970G, from the new images and the re-analysis of\nthe 20 cm observations taken in 1990, is 14h 03m 00.s 88 \u00b1 0.s 01 and +54\u25e6 14\u2032 33.\u2032\u2032 1 \u00b1 0.\u2032\u2032 2.\nUncertainties in the peak intensities are reported as the rms noise from the observations.\nAt 20 cm, the beam size is 1.\u2032\u2032 42 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 21, p.a. = \u221239.18\u25e6 , and the rms noise is 0.015 mJy\nbeam\u22121 . At 6 cm, the beam size is 1.\u2032\u2032 20 \u00d7 1.\u2032\u2032 20, p.a. = 0.00\u25e6, and the rms noise is 0.020\nmJy beam\u22121 . The results of our analyses are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nWe have detected a radio source at the position of SN 1970G at 20 cm and 6 cm,\ncoincident, within the error limits, with the CGS position. Our measured flux density at\n20 cm indicates a reduction in the 20 cm flux density of only 11% from 1990 to 2000 (see\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nTable 1). And, extrapolating from the 3.5 and 20 cm measurements reported by CGS, the 6\ncm flux density in 1990 would have been 0.11 mJy, which is virtually identical to the current\nvalue of 0.12 \u00b1 0.020 mJy (see Table 1). The CGS observations indicated that the flux\ndensity of SN 1970G had dropped between 1974 and 1990 with a power-law index (S \u221d t\u03b2 )\nof \u03b2 = \u22121.95 \u00b1 0.17 at 20 cm. Assuming the CGS power-law decline and spectral index\nfrom 1990, we would expect a much lower 6cm flux density, \u2243 0.050 mJy, and 20 cm flux\ndensity, \u2243 0.090 mJy than we now measure. The radio light-curve for SN 1970G between\n1990 and 2000 has flattened considerably and (based upon the 20 cm flux densities) the\npower-law index is now \u03b2 = \u22120.28 \u00b1 0.13. We illustrate this dramatic change in slope in the\nradio evolution of SN 1970G in Figure 2; where we show the radio light curves of several\nintermediate-age SNe along with a few SNRs, plotting the time since supernova explosion\nversus the luminosity at 20 cm (i.e. the monochromatic luminosity).\nAs indicated in Table 1 (and shown in Figure 1), our new observations indicate that\nSN 1970G is still a (marginally) non-thermal radio source. The current spectral index, \u03b1,\nof \u22120.24 \u00b1 0.20 has flattened from the value of \u22120.56 \u00b1 0.11 reported in 1990 by CGS,\nalthough the error bars are rather large. We might expect a possible flattening of the\nradio spectrum as the emission from SN 1970G continues to fade. Such was the case for\nSN 1957D, in M83, which had a very similar spectra index, \u22120.23 \u00b1 0.04, at a comparable\nage to SN 1970G (Cowan & Branch 1985). The thermal spectral index reported by Cowan\net al. (1994) for SN 1957D is actually due to the associated H II region that is now brighter\nthan the faded supernova. However, there has been no optical detection of an associated\nH II region coincident with SN 1970G, and thus it should be possible to continue to follow\nthe time evolution of the flux density and the spectral index for this supernova for many\nyears.\nThe current and previous values of the spectral index, luminosity, and decay index for\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nSN 1970G are within a range of values reported for other intermediate-age RSNe at similar\nages and wavelengths (See Table 1, Figure 2, and Stockdale et al. 2001). It is clear, for\nexample, from Figure 2 that the radio luminosity of SN 1970G at an age of \u2243 30 years is very\nclose to that of the Type II SNe 1950B and 1957D, in M83, SN1968D, in NGC 6946, and\nSN 1961V, in NGC 1058, at the same stage in their evolution (Cowan et al. 1994; Hyman\net al. 1995; Stockdale et al. 2001). This correlation in luminosity also lends credence to the\nidentification of SNe 1950B and 1961V as Type II SNe. In particular, there has been some\nuncertainty in the optical position of SN 1950B that prevented a conclusive identification\nof the supernovae with the radio source (Cowan & Branch 1985; Cowan et al. 1994). In the\ncase of SN 1961V, recent optical observations have caused some debate whether it was a\nsupernova event or a luminous blue variable (LBV) (Goodrich et al. 1989). On the other\nhand, recent radio observations of SNe 1961V strongly suggest a supernova interpretation\nfor this event (Stockdale et al. 2001).\nThe evolution of the radio flux density of SN 1970G is consistent with the current\nmodels for radio emission from SNe, which predict a general decline in radio luminosity\nwith age and declining density of CSM. Figure 2 illustrates that trend for a number of\nintermediate-age RSNe, with a general flattening of the radio light curve 10-40 years after\nthe supernova event. While SNe 1970G, 1961V, and 1950B are decaying at different rates,\nwe note that all of their radio light curves are noticeably flatter than that of SN 1957D at\nsimilar epochs. The differences in the behavior of the individual SNe (e.g. the rates at which\ntheir radio luminosities fade) could therefore be explained in terms of the density of the\nmaterial encountered by the supernova shock. Thus, for example, the shocks associated with\nsome RSNe (e.g. SNe 1979C, 1970G, and 1961V) might be traveling through considerably\ndenser CSM than other similarly-aged RSNe (e.g., SNe 1980K and 1957D). Consistent with\nthis interpretation is the very rapid decline and disappearance of the radio emissions of\nType Ib RSNe, e.g. SNe 1983N and 1984L, which presumably have lower density CSM than\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nType II SNe (Weiler et al. 1986; Sramek et al. 1984; Panagia et al. 1986).\nOne scenario which might explain this increased density of CSM around some Type II\nRSNe could be that the progenitors underwent large-scale eruptions, akin to LBVs, prior to\nthe supernova event. The mass loss rates during an LBV eruption can be 10-100\u00d7 larger\nthan the typical supergiant mass-loss rate (Humphreys & Davidson 1994). The exact epoch\nat which this may have occurred depends on the ejection velocities of the CSM during\nthese events, the rate of expansion of the supernova shock, and the density of the CSM.\nUnfortunately RSNe are too under-sampled to make any definitive statements as to the\nexact nature of such a possible outburst or mass loss. Clearly, additional radio monitoring\nof SN 1970G, and other RSNe, will be important in understanding the continuing evolution\nand nature of these relatively rare objects.\n\nWe would like to thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments that helped\nus to improve this Letter.
