Math. Dept., Universitetsparken 5,\nDK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. E-mail grubb@math.ku.dk\nAbstract. Spectral boundary conditions for Laplace-type operators on a compact manifold\nX with boundary are partly Dirichlet, partly (oblique) Neumann conditions, where the partitioning is provided by a pseudodifferential projection; they have an interest in string and\nbrane theory. Relying on pseudodifferential methods, we give sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of the associated resolvent and heat operator, and show asymptotic expansions of\ntheir traces in powers and power-log terms, allowing a smearing function \u03c6. The leading\nlog-coefficient is identified as a non-commutative residue, which vanishes when \u03c6 = 1.\nThe study has new consequences for well-posed (spectral) boundary problems for firstorder, Dirac-like elliptic operators (generalizing the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer problem). It is\nfound e.g. that the zeta function is always regular at zero. In the selfadjoint case, there is a\nstability of the zeta function value and the eta function regularity at zero, under perturbations\nof the boundary projection of order \u2212 dim X.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\nSpectral boundary conditions (involving a pseudodifferential projection \u03a0 on the boundary) were first employed by Atiyah, Patodi and Singer [APS75] in their seminal work on\nDirac operators D on manifolds X with boundary, introducing the eta-invariant of the\ntangential part of D as an extremely interesting new geometric object. For such a Dirac\nrealization D\u03a0 , the operator D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 (the square D\u03a0 2 in the selfadjoint case) is a Laplace\noperator with a boundary condition of the form\n(0.1)\n\n\u03a0\u03b30 u = 0,\n\n(I \u2212 \u03a0)(\u03b31 u + B\u03b30 u) = 0;\n\n\u2202 j\n) u|\u2202X , and B denotes a first-order operator on \u2202X (in the case derived\nhere \u03b3j u = ( \u2202n\nfrom D\u03a0 it is the tangential part of D). In this work we present a new analysis of Laplacetype operators with boundary conditions (0.1), under quite general choices of \u03a0 and B,\nshowing existence of heat trace expansions and meromorphic zeta functions, and analyzing\nthe leading logarithmic and nonlocal terms. The methods developed here moreover lead\nto new results on the corresponding questions for Dirac operator problems.\nIn a physics context, spectral boundary conditions are used in studies of axial anomalies\n(see e.g. Hortacsu, Rothe and Schroer [HRS80], Ninomiya and Tan [NT85], Niemi and\nSemenoff [NS86], Forgacs, O'Raifertaigh and Wipf [FOW87], see also Eguchi, Gilkey and\n1 To\n\nappear in Comm. Math. Phys.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nHanson [EGH80]), in quantum cosmology (see e.g. D'Eath and Esposito [EE91]), and in\nthe theory of the Aharonov-Bohm effect (see e.g. Beneventano, De Francia and Santangelo\n[BFS99]). For a long time, applications of spectral boundary conditions were limited to\nfields of half-integer spin whose dynamics are governed by first-order operators of Dirac\ntype. It is natural (and even required by supersymmetry arguments) to extend this scheme\nto integer spin fields, and, therefore, to operators of Laplace type. Indeed, a first step in this\ndirection has been taken in Vassilevich [V01], [V02], where spectral boundary conditions\nare formulated for bosonic strings to describe some collective states of open strings and\nDirichlet branes.\nLocal cases of (0.1), where \u03a0 is a projection morphism and B is a differential operator,\nhave been treated earlier (see e.g. Avramidi and Esposito [AE99] and its references); such\ncases have a mathematical foundation in Greiner [Gre71], Grubb [G74], Gilkey and Smith\n[GiS83], whereas the general global case is a new subject.\nEstablishing heat trace asymptotics is very important in quantum field theory since\nthey are related to ultra violet divergences and quantum anomalies (see e.g. the surveys of\nAvramidi [A02] and Fursaev [F02]). A vanishing of the leading logarithmic term means that\nthe standard definition of a functional determinant through the zeta function derivative\nat 0 is applicable, and the road is open to renormalization of the effective action.\nOverview of the contents: The problems for Laplace-type operators P are considered in\nSections 1\u20134. In Section 2 we give sufficient conditions for the existence of the resolvent\n(PT \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 in an angular region, with an explicit formula (Th. 2.10), and we use this to\nshow asymptotic expansions of traces Tr(F (PT \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m ) (for sufficiently large m) in powers\nand log-powers of \u03bb (Th. 2.13); here F is an arbitrary differential operator. In Section 3 we\nshow corresponding expansions of the heat trace Tr(F e\u2212tPT ) in powers and log-powers of t\n(Cor. 3.1), and establish meromorphic extensions of zeta functions \u03b6(F, PT , s) = Tr(F PT\u2212s )\nwith simple and double real poles in s. (These constructions do not need a differential\noperator square root of P as discussed in [V01].)\nThe leading logarithmic term and nonlocal term are analyzed in Section 4 when F\nis a morphism or a first-order operator. This is done by determining which part of the\nresolvent actually contributes to these values (Th. 4.1). It follows that the log-coefficient\nidentifies with a certain non-commutative residue, vanishing e.g. when F = I (Th. 4.2,\n4.5). Then the zeta function is regular at 0, and the value at zero can be set in relation to\nan eta-invariant associated with \u03a0 (Th. 4.9, Def. 4.10). Special results are also obtained\nwhen F is a first-order operator and certain symmetry properties hold.\nIn Section 5 we draw some conclusions for operators D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 defined from a Dirac-type\noperator D (of the form \u03c3(\u2202xn + A + perturb.) near \u2202X with A selfadjoint elliptic on \u2202X)\ntogether with a pseudodifferential orthogonal projection \u03a0 on \u2202X defining the boundary condition \u03a0\u03b30 u = 0. Atiyah, Patodi and Singer [APS75] considered such problems\nwith \u03a0 equal to the nonnegative eigenprojection \u03a0\u2265 (A), and increasingly general choices\nhave been treated through the years: Douglas and Wojciechowski [DW91], M\u00fcller [M94],\nDai and Freed [DF94], Grubb and Seeley [GS95], [GS96] gave results on perturbations\n\u03a0\u2265 (A) + S by finite rank operators S; [W99] allowed smoothing operators S. Br\u00fcning\nand Lesch [BL99] introduced a special class of other projections \u03a0(\u03b8), and [G99], [G01\u2032 ]\nincluded all projections satisfying the well-posedness condition of Seeley [S69\u2032\u2032 ].\nThe methods of the present study lead to new results both for zeta and eta functions.\n\u2217\n\u2217\nThe zeta function \u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , s) = Tr((D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 )\u2212s ) is shown to be regular at s = 0 for any\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n3\n\nwell-posed \u03a0 such that the principal parts of \u03a0 and A2 commute (Cor. 5.3). This was\nknown previously for perturbations of \u03a0\u2265 (A) and \u03a0(\u03b8) of order \u2212 dim X (cf. [G01\u2032 ]); the\nnew result includes in particular the perturbations of \u03a0\u2265 (A) and \u03a0(\u03b8) of order \u22121. The\n\u2217\nvalue \u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0) is determined from \u03a0 and ker D\u03a0 modulo local terms (Cor. 5.4).\nRestricting the attention to cases with selfadjointness at \u2202X, assuming\n(0.2)\n\n\u03c3 2 = \u2212I,\n\n\u03c3A = \u2212A\u03c3,\n\n\u03a0 = \u2212\u03c3\u03a0\u22a5 \u03c3,\ns+1\n\n\u2217\nwe get new results for the eta function \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s) = Tr(D(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 )\u2212 2 ): It has at most a\nsimple pole at s = 0 for general well-posed \u03a0 (Cor. 5.8); this includes perturbations of\n\u03a0\u2265 (A) and \u03a0(\u03b8) of order \u22121, where it was previously known for order \u2212 dim X in the\nselfadjoint product case. Moreover, the residue at s = 0 is locally determined, and stable\nunder perturbations of \u03a0 of order \u2264 \u2212 dim X (Th. 5.9). In particular, in the selfadjoint\nproduct case, the vanishing of the simple pole, shown for special cases in [DW91], [M94],\n[W99], [BL99], is stable under perturbations of order \u2212 dim X. (For the last result, see\nalso Lei [L02].) There are similar stability results for the value of zeta at 0 (Th. 5.7).\n\nThe author is grateful to D. Vassilevich, R. Mazzeo, P. Gilkey, R. Melrose, E.

Boundary conditions with projections.\nConsider a second-order strongly elliptic differential operator P acting on the sections\nof an N -dimensional C \u221e vector bundle E over a compact C \u221e n-dimensional manifold X\nwith boundary X \u2032 = \u2202X.\nX is provided with a volume element and E with a hermitian metric defining a Hilbert\nspace structure on the sections, L2 (E). We denote E|X \u2032 = E \u2032 . A neighborhood of X \u2032\nin X has the form Xc = X \u2032 \u00d7 [0, c[ (the points denoted x = (x\u2032 , xn )), and there E is\nisomorphic to the pull-back of E \u2032 . On Xc , there is a smooth volume element v(x)dx\u2032 dxn ,\nand v(x\u2032 , 0)dx\u2032 is the volume element on X \u2032 (defining L2 (E \u2032 )).\nWe assume that P is principally selfadjoint, i.e., P \u2212 P \u2217 is of order \u2264 1. Moreover, to\nhave simple ingredients to work with, we assume that P is of the following form near X \u2032 :\nAssumption 1.1. On Xc , P has the form\n(1.1)\n\nP = \u2212\u2202x2n + P \u2032 + xn P2 + P1 ,\n\nwhere P \u2032 is an elliptic selfadjoint nonnegative second-order differential operator in E \u2032\n(independent of xn ) and the Pj are differential operators of order j in E|Xc .\nLet \u03a01 be a classical pseudodifferential operator (\u03c8do) in E \u2032 of order 0 with \u03a021 = \u03a01 ,\ni.e., a projection operator, and denote the complementing projection by \u03a02 :\n(1.2)\n\n\u03a02 = I \u2212 \u03a01 .\n\nLet B be a first-order differential or pseudodifferential operator in E \u2032 . Then we consider\nthe boundary condition for P :\n(1.3)\n\n\u03a01 \u03b30 u = 0,\n\n\u03a02 (\u03b31 u + B\u03b30 u) = 0,\n\n\f4\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nwhere the notation \u03b3j u = (\u2202xj n u)|X \u2032 is used. In short, T u = 0, where\n(1.4)\n\nT = {\u03a01 \u03b30 , \u03a02 (\u03b31 + B\u03b30 )}.\n\nWe shall study the resolvent and the heat operator defined from P under this boundary\ncondition, when suitable parameter-ellipticity conditions are satisfied. More precisely, with\nH s (E) denoting the Sobolev space of order s (with norm kuks ), we define the realization\nPT in L2 (E) determined by the boundary condition (1.3) as the operator acting like P\nand with domain\nD(PT ) = {u \u2208 H 2 (E) | T u = 0};\nthen we want to construct the resolvent (PT \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 and the heat operator e\u2212tPT and\nanalyze their trace properties. In particular, we want to show a heat trace expansion\n(1.5)\n\nTr e\u2212tPT \u223c\n\nX\n\n\u2212n\u2264k<0\n\nk\n\nak t 2 +\n\nX\n\nk\u22650\n\n\u0001 k\n\u2212a\u2032k log t + a\u2032\u2032k t 2 .\n\nSuch expansions are known to hold for normal differential boundary conditions (Seeley\n[S69], [S69\u2032 ], Greiner [Gre71]) without the logarithmic terms, and for pseudo-normal \u03c8do\nboundary conditions [G99], but the condition (1.3) is in general not of these types.\nExample 1.2. Assumption 1.1 holds if P = D\u2217 D for an operator type including Dirac\noperators, namely a first-order elliptic differential operator D from E to another N dimensional bundle E1 over X such that\n(1.6)\n\nD = \u03c3(\u2202xn + A1 ) with A1 = A + xn A11 + A10 on Xc ,\n\nas considered in numerous works, originating in Atiyah, Patodi and Singer [APS75]; here\n\u03c3 is a unitary morphism from E \u2032 to E1\u2032 , A is a selfadjoint first-order elliptic operator in\nE \u2032 independent of xn , and the A1j are xn -dependent differential operators in E \u2032 of order\nj. Then we can take P \u2032 = A2 . However, for the study in the following one does not need\nto have a differential operator \"square root\" of P \u2032 . (And, if P is derived from (1.6) near\nX \u2032 , the factorization need not extend to all of X.) See Vassilevich [V01] for a discussion\nof how one can find such D when P is a Laplacian.\nWhen P = D\u2217 D, one can for example take as \u03a01 the orthogonal projection \u03a0\u2265 (A) onto\nthe nonnegative eigenspace of A and let B = A1 |xn =0 , also denoted A1 (0). Then PT equals\n\u2217\nD\u2265\nD\u2265 , where D\u2265 is the realization of D under the boundary condition \u03a0\u2265 (A)\u03b30 u = 0,\nand (1.5) is known from [GS95] (also with certain finite rank perturbations of \u03a0\u2265 (A)).\nBoundary conditions (1.3) with such choices of \u03a01 are often called spectral boundary conditions.\nThe paper [G99] allows much more general realizations D\u03a01 of D, where \u03a0\u2265 (A) is\nreplaced by a \u03c8do projection \u03a01 that is \"well-posed\" with respect to D. Well-posedness\n(introduced by Seeley [S69\u2032\u2032 ]) means that the principal symbol \u03c010 at each (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) \u2208 S \u2217 (X \u2032 )\nmaps N+ (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) bijectively onto the range of \u03c010 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) in CN , where N+ (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) is the space\nof boundary values of null-solutions:\nN+ (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) = { z(0) \u2208 CN | d0 (x\u2032 , 0, \u03be \u2032 , Dxn )z(xn ) = 0, z \u2208 L2 (R+ )N },\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n5\n\nd0 denoting the principal symbol of D. As shown in [S69\u2032\u2032 ], the closed-range operator\ndefining the boundary condition may always be taken to be a projection; it may even be\ntaken orthogonal. When \u03a01 is orthogonal, then (D\u03a01 )\u2217 D\u03a01 = PT with B = A1 (0) in\n(1.3)\u2013(1.4), and (1.5) holds. (Further details in Section 5.)\nIn [V01], Vassilevich points to the need for considering other choices of B - and not\njust B = 0 but moreover cases unrelated to A1 and having complex coefficients, where PT\nis not selfadjoint. He inquires about heat kernel results for such cases, and that is precisely\nwhat we want to develop here.\nThe conditions in (1.3) can be defined without reference to a factorization as in Example\n1.2; \u03a01 can be a general pseudodifferential projection in E \u2032 unrelated to P \u2032 .\nFor the case where \u03a01 is a local projection (a projection morphism in E \u2032 ranging in a\nsubbundle F0 ), the question of heat trace expansions is covered by Greiner [Gre71], see\nalso [G74], [G96].\nSince P is strongly elliptic, it satisfies the G\u00e5rding inequality, so we can assume (possibly\nafter addition of a constant) that\n(1.7)\n\nRe(P u, u) \u2265 c0 kuk21 , for u \u2208 C0\u221e (X \u25e6 ),\n\nwith c0 > 0. Then the Dirichlet realization PD (the realization of P in L2 (E) with domain\nD(PD ) = {u \u2208 H 2 (E) | \u03b30 u = 0}) is invertible. We shall use the following notation for\nregions in C:\n(1.8)\n\n\u0393\u03b8 = { \u03bc \u2208 C \\ {0} | | arg \u03bc| < \u03b8 },\n\n\u0393 = \u0393 \u03c02 ,\n\n\u0393\u03b8,r = { \u03bc \u2208 \u0393\u03b8 | |\u03bc| > r }.\n\nSince the principal symbol of P is positive selfadjoint, the spectrum of PD is for any \u03b4 > 0\ncontained in a set\n(1.9)\n\n\u03a3\u03b4,R = \u0393\u03b4 \u222a {|\u03bb| \u2264 R(\u03b4)}\n\nfor some R = R(\u03b4), in addition to being contained in {Re \u03bb > 0}.\nWe denote (PD \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 = RD (\u03bb), the resolvent of the Dirichlet problem, i.e. the solution\noperator for the semi-homogeneous problem\n(1.10)\n\n(P \u2212 \u03bb)u = f in X,\n\n\u03b30 u = 0 on X \u2032 ;\n\nRD maps H s (E) continuously into H s+2 (E) for s > \u2212 32 , when \u03bb \u2208\n/ \u03a3\u03b4,R .

Resolvent constructions.\nOur way to construct the heat operator for PT goes via the resolvent, which is particularly well suited to calculations in the pseudodifferential\nframework, since the spectral\n\u221a\nparameter \u03bb (or, rather, the square root \u03bc = \u2212\u03bb ) enters to some extent like a cotangent\nvariable. In the following, we shall freely use the notation and results of Grubb and Seeley\n[GS95], Grubb [G01]. To save space, we do not repeat many details here but refer to these\npapers or to the perhaps simpler resum\u00e9 of the needed parts of the calculus in [G02, Sect.\n2]. Let us just recall the definition of the symbol space S m,d,s (Rn\u22121 \u00d7Rn\u22121 , \u039b) (denoted\nS m,d,s (\u039b) for short), where \u039b is a sector of C \\ {0} and m, d, s \u2208 Z:\nA C \u221e function p(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) lies in S m,0,0 (Rn\u22121\u00d7Rn\u22121 , \u039b) when, for every closed subsector\n\u039b\u2032 ,\nj\np(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , 1/z) \u2208 S m+j (Rn\u22121 \u00d7Rn\u22121 ) uniformly for |z| \u2264 1, 1/z \u2208 \u039b\u2032 ;\n\u2202|z|\nhere S k (Rn\u22121 \u00d7Rn\u22121 ) is the usual symbol space of functions q(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) with\n|\u2202x\u03b2\u2032 \u2202\u03be\u03b1\u2032 q(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 )| \u2264 C\u03b1,\u03b2 h\u03be \u2032 ik\u2212|\u03b1|\n1\n\nfor all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Nn\u22121 ; we write hxi = (1 + |x|2 ) 2 and N = {0, 1, 2, . . . }. Moreover,\nS m,d,s (Rn\u22121 \u00d7Rn\u22121 , \u039b) = \u03bcd (|\u03bc|2 + |\u03be \u2032 |2 )s/2 S m,0,0 (Rn\u22121 \u00d7Rn\u22121 , \u039b).\nIn the applications, we often need p and its derivatives to be holomorphic in \u03bc \u2208 \u039b\u25e6 for\n|\u03bc| + |\u03be \u2032 | \u2265 \u03b5 > 0; such symbols will just be said to be holomorphic (in \u03bc).\nThe space denoted S m,d (\u039b) in [GS95] is the space of holomorphic symbols in S m,d,0 (\u039b).\nThe third upper index s was added in [G01] for convenience; one has in view of [GS95,\nLemma 1.13] that\n(2.1)\n\nS m,d,s (\u039b) \u2282 S m+s,d,0 (\u039b) \u2229 S m,d+s,0 (\u039b) for s \u2264 0,\n\nS m,d,s (\u039b) \u2282 S m+s,d,0 (\u039b) + S m,d+s,0 (\u039b) for s \u2265 0,\n\nand the s-index saves us from keeping track of a lot of sums and intersections.\nThe \u03c8do with symbol p(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) is defined by the usual formula:\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nei(x \u2212y )*\u03be p(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc)v(y \u2032 ) dy \u2032 d\u2013\u03be \u2032 ,\nOP (p) : v(x ) 7\u2192\nR2(n\u22121)\n\nwhere d\u2013\u03be \u2032 stands for (2\u03c0)1\u2212n d\u03be \u2032 ; the analogous definition on Rn is indicated by OP. \u03a8do's\nin bundles over manifolds are defined by use of local trivializations.\nmoreover have expansions in homogeneous terms, p \u223c\nP The symbols, we consider,\nm\u2212j,d,s\n(\u039b), homogeneous in (\u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) of degree m \u2212 j + d + s.\nj\u2208N pm\u2212j with pm\u2212j \u2208 S\nIn the general, so-called weakly polyhomogeneous case, the homogeneity takes place for\n|\u03be \u2032 | \u2265 1, but if it extends to |\u03be \u2032 | + |\u03bc| \u2265 1 (in such a way that the symbol behaves as a standard classical symbol in the non-parametrized calculus with an extra cotangent variable |\u03bc|\nentering on a par with \u03be \u2032 in the estimates), the symbol is called strongly polyhomogeneous.\nThe composition rules for these spaces are straightforward: When pi \u2208 S mi ,di ,si (\u039b) for\ni = 1, 2, then p1 p2 and p1 \u25e6 p2 \u2208 S m1 +m2 ,d1 +d2 ,s1 +s2 (\u039b); the latter is the symbol of the\ncomposed operator OP\u2032 (p1 ) OP\u2032 (p2 ), satisfying\nX (\u2212i)|\u03b1|\n\u03b1\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u03b1\n\u2032 \u2032\n(2.2)\n(p1 \u25e6 p2 )(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) \u223c\n\u03b1! \u2202\u03be\u2032 p1 (x , \u03be , \u03bc)\u2202x\u2032 p2 (x , \u03be , \u03bc).\n\u03b1\u2208Nn\u22121\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n7\n\nBefore discussing the construction of the resolvent, we shall introduce some auxiliary\n1\npseudodifferential operators on X \u2032 . When \u03bb \u2208 C \\ R+ , we write \u03bc = (\u2212\u03bb) 2 , defined such\nthat \u03bc \u2208 \u0393 (cf. (1.8)).\nDefinition 2.1. The operator A(\u03bb) is defined for \u03bb \u2208 C \\ R+ by\n1\n\nA(\u03bb) = (P \u2032 \u2212 \u03bb) 2 ;\nit is a \u03c8do in E \u2032 of order 1.\n1\n\nAs a function of \u03bc = (\u2212\u03bb) 2 \u2208 \u0393, A is a strongly polyhomogeneous \u03c8do with symbol in\n0,0,1\nS\n(\u0393)N\u00d7N in local trivializations, its principal symbol being equal to\n(2.3)\n\n0\n\n1\n\na0 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) = (p\u2032 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) + \u03bc2 ) 2 .\n\nThis follows essentially from Seeley [S69], since p\u2032 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 )+e2i\u03b8 t2 is a classical elliptic symbol\nof order 2 with respect to the cotangent variables (\u03be \u2032 , t). Moreover, A(\u2212\u03bc2 ) is invertible for\n\u03bc \u2208 \u0393, and parameter-elliptic (as defined in [G96]), and A\u22121 has symbol in S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393)N\u00d7N\n1\n0\nin local trivializations, with principal part (a0 )\u22121 = (p\u2032 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) + \u03bc2 )\u2212 2 . The symbols are\nholomorphic in \u03bc. We observe furthermore that since \u2202\u03bbr A = cr A1\u22122r , \u2202\u03bbr A has symbol in\nS 0,0,1\u22122r (\u0393)N\u00d7N for r \u2208 N.\nThe indication by an upper index N\u00d7N means that the symbols are N\u00d7N -matrix valued.\nThe statement \"has symbol in S m,d,s (\u0393)N\u00d7N in local trivializations\" will be written briefly\nas: \"\u2208 OP\u2032 S m,d,s (\u0393)\".\nIn the case considered in Example 1.2, A(\u03bb) is the operator called A\u03bb in [GS96] and\n[G02], A\u03bc in [GS95], and A(0) = |A|.\nDefinition 2.2. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator ADN is defined for \u03bb \u2208\n/ \u03a3\u03b4,R by:\n(2.4)\n\nADN (\u03bb) = \u03b31 KD (\u03bb);\n\ncf. (1.11) ff.\nThe operator ADN is a \u03c8do of order 1 for each \u03bb; this is a well-known fact in the calculus\nof pseudodifferential boundary problems (cf. Boutet de Monvel [BM71], Grubb [G96]). We\nobserve moreover:\nLemma 2.3. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator ADN (\u03bb) is a strongly polyhomogeneous\n\u03c8do in E \u2032 of order 1, which is principally equal to \u2212A(\u03bb), i.e.,\n(2.5)\n\nADN (\u03bb) = \u2212A(\u03bb) + A\u2032DN (\u03bb),\n\nwhere ADN (\u2212\u03bc2 ) \u2208 OP\u2032 S 0,0,1 (\u0393) and A\u2032DN (\u2212\u03bc2 ) \u2208 OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 (\u0393), with holomorphic symbols.\nProof. Clearly, ADN (\u2212\u03bc2 ) is strongly polyhomogeneous of order 1, in the terminology of\n[GS95], [G01], since its symbol can be found from the corresponding calculation in the case\nwhere \u03bc = ei\u03b8 t is replaced by ei\u03b8 \u2202xn+1 . Then its symbol is in S 0,0,1 (\u0393)N\u00d7N . Formula (2.5)\nis derived from the fact that the principal part of P + \u03bc2 at xn = 0 equals the principal\npart of \u2212\u2202x2n + P \u2032 + \u03bc2 . For the latter operator considered on X \u2032 \u00d7 R+ , the Poisson\n\n\f8\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\noperator solving the semi-homogeneous Dirichlet problem as in (1.11) is the mapping\n\u03c6(x\u2032 ) 7\u2192 z(x\u2032 , xn ) = e\u2212xn A(\u03bb) \u03c6 (as in [G02, Prop. 2.11] with A2 replaced by P \u2032 ); application\nof \u2202xn followed by restriction to xn = 0 gives the mapping \u03c6 7\u2192 \u2212A(\u03bb)\u03c6. Then ADN (\u03bb)\nand \u2212A(\u03bb) are principally equal, so their difference A\u2032DN is strongly polyhomogeneous of\norder 0, hence has symbol in S 0,0,0 (\u0393)N\u00d7N . \u0003\nIn particular, ADN (\u2212\u03bc2 ) is parameter-elliptic, hence invertible for large enough \u03bc, the\ninverse having symbol in S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393)N\u00d7N (see Proposition 2.8 below). Note that \u2202\u03bbr ADN (\u03bb)\nis strongly polyhomogeneous of degree 1 \u2212 2r, hence lies in OP\u2032 S 0,0,1\u22122r (\u0393).\nIn our construction of the resolvent below, we need to be able to commute ADN and \u03a01\nwith an error having symbol in S 0,0,0 . For this we introduce\nAssumption 2.4. The principal symbols of \u03a01 and P \u2032 commute.\nThis holds of course if \u03a01 commutes with P \u2032 (as in Example 1.2 with P \u2032 = A2 , \u03a01 = \u03a0\u2265\nor \u03a0< ); it holds for general choices of \u03a01 if P \u2032 has scalar principal symbol.\nProposition 2.5. Under Assumption 2.4, [ADN , \u03a01 ] = ADN \u03a01 \u2212 \u03a01 ADN and [A, \u03a01 ] =\nA\u03a01 \u2212 \u03a01 A are in OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 (\u0393), with holomorphic symbols. Moreover, for any r \u2265 0, the\nr'th \u03bb-derivatives are in OP\u2032 S 0,0,\u22122r (\u0393).\nProof. The main effort lies in the treatment of the case r = 0. Note first that since A\u2032DN\nand \u03a01 are in OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 , so is their commutator [A\u2032DN , \u03a01 ], so in view of (2.5), what we\nhave to show is that [A, \u03a01 ] is in OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 . Denote P \u2032 +\u03bc2 = P , with symbol p\u2032 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 )+\u03bc2\nin local coordinates. The powers of P are defined for low values of s by\nZ\ns\ni\n\u033as (P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 d\u033a,\nP = 2\u03c0\nC\n\nwhere C is a curve in C \\ R\u2212 encircling the spectrum of P ; we let it begin with a ray\nwith angle \u03b4 and end with a ray with angle \u2212\u03b4, for some \u03b4 \u2208 ]0, \u03c02 [ . (The location of\n1\n(r + \u03bc2 ) 2 when r \u2208 R+ is discussed in Remark 2.11 below.) Then since [(P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 , \u03a01 ] =\n(P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 [\u03a01 , P \u2032 ](P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 ,\nZ\ns\ni\n\u033as (P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 [\u03a01 , P \u2032 ](P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 d\u033a.\n[P , \u03a01 ] = 2\u03c0\nC\n\nHere, by the commutativity of the principal symbols, [\u03a01 , P \u2032 ] = M is a first-order \u03c8do\n(independent of \u033a and \u03bc). The integral makes good sense for s < 1 (converges in the norm\n1\n\nof operators from H 1 (E \u2032 ) to L2 (E \u2032 )), so we can write, since P 2 = A,\nZ\n1\ni\n(2.6)\n[A, \u03a01 ] = 2\u03c0\n\u033a 2 (P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 M (P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 d\u033a.\nC\n\nThe symbol of [A, \u03a01 ] in a local coordinate system can be found (modulo smoothing terms)\nfrom this formula. It is represented by a series of terms obtained from (2.6) by insertion\nof the symbol expansions of the involved operators (P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 and M and applications of\nthe composition rule (2.2). We have that the symbol of (P \u2212 \u033a)\u22121 is an (N \u00d7 N )-matrix\n1\nr(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc, \u033a) whose entries rij are series of strongly homogeneous functions of (\u03be \u2032 , \u03bc, \u033a 2 ),\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n9\n\nwhereas the symbol m(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) of M is a matrix whose elements mij are series of functions\nhomogeneous in \u03be \u2032 outside a neighborhhod of 0. The composition will give rise to integrals\nof products\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2202x\u03b3\u2032 ,\u03be\u2032 rij \u2202x\u03b3\u2032 ,\u03be\u2032 mjk \u2202x\u03b3\u2032 ,\u03be\u2032 rkl ;\nthere are finitely many contributions to each degree of homogeneity. The important thing\nis that in each homogeneous contribution, we can take the factor coming from mjk outside\nthe integral sign, since it does not depend on \u033a (nor on \u03bc). What is left is a completely\nhomogeneous integrand, which after integration gives a strongly homogeneous function\nof (\u03be \u2032 , \u03bc). The factors coming from m are of degree \u2264 1, hence lie in S 1,0,0 , and the\ncontributions from the integration are of degree \u2264 \u22121, hence lie in S 0,0,\u22121 (moreover,\n\u03be \u2032 -differentiation of order \u03b1 lowers the former to S 1\u2212|\u03b1|,0,0 and the latter to S 0,0,\u22121\u2212|\u03b1| ).\nThe full contributions are then in S 1,0,0 * S 0,0,\u22121 \u2282 S 0,0,0 , and can be collected in a series\nof terms of falling degrees. Thus [A, \u03a01 ] has a symbol series in S 0,0,0 .\nThere is still the question of whether the remainder R, the difference between the\noperator defined from (P \u2212\u033a)\u22121 M (P \u2212\u033a)\u22121 and an operator S defined from a superposition\nof the homogeneous terms, also has the right kind of symbol. It takes a certain effort to\nprove this. We know \u00e0 priori, since A has symbol in S 0,0,1 and \u03a01 has symbol in S 0,0,0 ,\nthat [A, \u03a01 ] has symbol in S 0,0,1 \u2282 S 1,0,0 + S 0,1,0 . The remainder R will be of order \u2212\u221e\nin this class, hence have symbol in S \u2212\u221e,1,0 , and we have to show that this can be reduced\nto S \u2212\u221e,0,0 .\nRecall that an operator R with symbol in S \u2212\u221e,1,0 has a kernel expansion\nX\nK(R)(x\u2032 , y \u2032 , \u03bc) \u223c\nKj (x\u2032 , y \u2032 )\u03bc1\u2212j ,\nj\u22650\n\nP\nwith K(R) \u2212 j<J Kj \u03bc1\u2212j = O(h\u03bci1\u2212J ) for all J, where the Kj (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) are C \u221e kernels,\nby [GS95, Prop. 1.21]. With R0 denoting the operator\nwith kernel K0 , we can write\nP\n\u2032\n\u2032\nR = \u03bcR0 + R where R has the kernel expansion j\u22651 Kj \u03bc1\u2212j , hence symbol in S \u2212\u221e,0,0 ,\nso we are through if we show that R0 = 0.\nLet \u03bc run on the ray R+ , and let \u03b5 \u2208 ]0, 21 [ .

We have that [A, \u03a01 ] = S + \u03bcR0 + R\u2032 , where S + R\u2032 is bounded in L2 uniformly in\n\u2212\u03b5\n\u03bc for \u03bc \u2265 1, hence P (S + R\u2032 ) is \u00e0 fortiori so.

The problem of constructing the resolvent will be\ntransformed by some auxiliary constructions:\nFirst, we can extend P to a strongly elliptic principally selfadjoint differential operator\ne\ne in which X is smoothly imbedded, modifying\nP on an n-dimensional compact manifold X\nthe definition of R(\u03b4) in (1.9) such that also the spectrum of Pe is contained in \u03a3\u03b4,R . Assume\nin the following that \u03bb \u2208\n/ \u03a3\u03b4,R . Let Q(\u03bb) be the inverse of Pe \u2212 \u03bb and let Q+ = r + Qe+ be\ne to X, e+ is extension by zero on X\ne \\ X). It\nits truncation to X (r + is restriction from X\nis well-known that RD (\u03bb) and KD (\u03bb) (cf.

One could also carry out the whole\ncalculation for C \u221e sections while keeping track of the orders of the involved operators.\nWe now make a reduction of (2.15) using ADN . When z \u2208 H 2 (E) with (P \u2212 \u03bb)z = 0, z\n3\nis in 1-1 correspondence with \u03b30 z running through the space H 2 (E \u2032 ):\n(2.16)\n\nz = KD \u03b30 z,\n\nin view of the unique solvability of the Dirichlet problem. Denote \u03b30 z = \u03c6; then we can\nreplace \u03b30 z by \u03c6 in (2.15). Moreover, \u03b31 z = ADN \u03c6. So, with z = KD \u03c6 (assuring the\nvalidity of the first line in (2.15)), we arrive at the problem for \u03c6:\n\u03a01 \u03c6 = 0,\n\n(2.17)\n\n\u03a02 (ADN + B)\u03c6 = \u03c8.\n1\n\n1\n\nSince the mapping \u03b31 : D(PD ) \u2192 H 2 (E \u2032 ) is surjective, \u03b31 v runs through all of H 2 (E \u2032 )\nwhen f runs through L2 (E). So the reduced problem (2.17) must be solved for all \u03c8 \u2208\n1\n\u03a02 (H 2 (E \u2032 )). When f is given in L2 (E) and v and \u03c8 are defined by (2.14), then, if\n3\n\u03c6 \u2208 H 2 (E \u2032 ) solves (2.17) and we set z = KD \u03c6, u = v + z, we find that u \u2208 H 2 (E) solves\n(2.12).\nLemma 2.6. For \u03bb \u2208\n/ \u03a3\u03b4,R , define\n(2.18)\n\nS(\u03bb) = ADN + [ADN , \u03a01 ] + \u03a02 B\u03a02 ,\nS \u2032 (\u03bb) = ADN \u2212 [ADN , \u03a01 ].\n3\n\n1\n\nWhen \u03c8 runs through \u03a02 H 2 (E \u2032 ), the problem (2.17) is uniquely solvable with \u03c6 \u2208 H 2 (E \u2032 )\n3\n1\nfor those \u03bb for which S(\u03bb) and S \u2032 (\u03bb) are invertible from H 2 (E \u2032 ) to H 2 (E \u2032 ). When this\nholds, the solution is\n(2.19)\n\n\u03c6 = S(\u03bb)\u22121 \u03c8.\n\nUniqueness of solution holds when merely S(\u03bb) is injective.\n\n\f12\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nProof. Assume first that \u03c6 is a solution of (2.17). By the first equation, \u03c6 = \u03a02 \u03c6, so we\ncan rewrite the second equation as:\n(2.20)\n\nADN \u03a02 \u03c6 + [\u03a02 , ADN ]\u03c6 + \u03a02 B\u03a02 \u03c6 = \u03c8.\n\nNow we compose the first equation of (2.17) with ADN and add it to (2.20); this gives that\n\u03c6 satisfies\n(ADN + [\u03a02 , ADN ] + \u03a02 B\u03a02 )\u03c6 = \u03c8.\nSince [\u03a02 , ADN ] = [ADN , \u03a01 ], the operator in the left-hand side equals S(\u03bb) defined in\n(2.18), so \u03c6 satisfies\n(2.21)\n\nS(\u03bb)\u03c6 = \u03c8.\n\nWhen S(\u03bb) is injective, there is at most one solution \u03c6 of (2.21), hence of (2.17); when\nS(\u03bb) is bijective, the only possibility is that it equals S(\u03bb)\u22121 \u03c8.\nNow assume that also S \u2032 (\u03bb) is invertible, and, for a given \u03c8 with \u03a01 \u03c8 = 0, define \u03c6\nby (2.19). Then of course (2.21) holds, and we shall show that \u03c6 solves (2.17). Since\n\u03a01 \u03a02 = 0 and \u03a021 = \u03a01 , an application of \u03a01 to (2.21) gives:\n0 = \u03a01 S\u03c6 = \u03a01 (ADN \u03c6 + [ADN , \u03a01 ]\u03c6 + \u03a02 B\u03a02 \u03c6)\n(2.22)\n\n= \u03a01 ADN \u03c6 + \u03a01 ADN \u03a01 \u03c6 \u2212 \u03a021 ADN \u03c6 = \u03a01 ADN \u03a01 \u03c6\n\n= (ADN \u2212 [ADN , \u03a01 ])\u03a01 \u03c6 = S \u2032 (\u03bb)\u03a01 \u03c6.\n\nIt follows that \u03a01 \u03c6 = 0, so \u03c6 satisfies the first equation in (2.17). The second equation is\nthen retrieved from this and (2.21): Since \u03a02 \u03c6 = \u03c6,\n(2.23)\n\n\u03c8 = (ADN + [ADN , \u03a01 ] + \u03a02 B\u03a02 )\u03c6\n= ADN \u03a02 \u03c6 + [\u03a02 , ADN ]\u03c6 + \u03a02 B\u03c6 = \u03a02 (ADN + B)\u03c6. \u0003\n\nWhen Assumption 2.4 holds, the commutator terms in (2.18) have symbol in S 0,0,0 .\nThen we will show that S \u2032 (\u03bb) can be inverted for large |\u03bb| within the weakly polyhomogeneous calculus, and that the same holds for S(\u03bb) when the following assumption is\nsatisfied:\nAssumption 2.7. There is a \u03b8 \u2208 ]0, \u03c02 ] such that, with bh (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) and \u03c0ih (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) denoting\nthe strictly homogeneous principal symbols of B and the \u03a0i ,\n(2.24)\n\na0 \u2212 \u03c02h bh \u03c02h is invertible for \u03be \u2032 \u2208 Rn , \u03bc \u2208 \u0393\u03b8 \u222a {0} with (\u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) 6= (0, 0).\n\nThis will allow construction of a resolvent family for large \u03bb with | arg(\u2212\u03bb)| < 2\u03b8. If,\nmoreover, \u03b8 > \u03c04 , we can also construct a heat operator family. Note that when B is a\ndifferential operator, its symbol is a polynomial, so bh equals the usual principal symbol\nb0 . For \u03a02 , the strictly homogeneous principal symbol \u03c02h is in general not continuous at\n\u03be \u2032 = 0, but when it is multiplied by bh , which is O(|\u03be \u2032 |), we get a continuous function at\n\u03be \u2032 = 0 (taking the value 0 there).\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n13\n\nProposition 2.8.

For each r \u2208 N, \u2202\u03bbr map\nthem into operators in OP\u2032 S 0,0,\u22121\u22122r (\u0393\u03b8 ).\nProof. Let us go directly to the proof of (ii), the statements in (i) are proved by easier\nvariants. We have on one hand that S(\u2212\u03bc2 ) is composed of operators of the type considered\nin [G96], with the \u03bc-dependent factors of regularity \u221e and the \u03a0i of regularity 0, B of\nregularity \u221e resp. 1 if it is a differential resp. pseudodifferential operator. Removing the\ncommutator term [ADN , \u03a01 ] from (2.20) for a moment, we have an operator\n(2.25)\n\nS \u2032\u2032 (\u2212\u03bc2 ) = ADN + \u03a02 B\u03a02 = \u2212A + A\u2032DN + \u03a02 B\u03a02 ,\n\nwhich is of regularity 1 (since \u03a02 B\u03a02 is so), so that the invertibility of the strictly homogeneous principal symbol \u2212a0 + \u03c02h bh \u03c02h assures parameter-ellipticity in the sense of [G96],\ncf. Prop. 2.1.12 there. Then S \u2032\u2032 (\u2212\u03bc2 ) is invertible for \u03bc \u2208 \u0393\u03b8\u2032 ,r with a sufficiently large r,\nthe inverse being continuous from H s,\u03bc (E) to H s+1,\u03bc (E) for s \u2208 R, by [G96, Th. 3.2.11].\nSince the commutator term has L2 -norm bounded in \u03bc by Proposition 2.5, we find by a\nNeumann series argument that S(\u2212\u03bc2 ) itself is invertible for large r with an inverse that\nis bounded from L2 (E) to H 1,\u03bc (E).\nNow A\u22121 S is likewise invertible for the considered \u03bc, and lies in OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 (\u0393\u03b8 ) since\nA\u22121 lies in OP\u2032 S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393). Then the \"spectral invariance theorem\" [G99, Th. 6.5], applied to A\u22121 S, shows that its inverse S \u22121 A belongs to our weakly polyhomogeneous calculus and lies in OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 (\u0393\u03b8 ).

It should be noted that the proof of Lemma 2.6 only shows the necessity\nof unique solvability of (2.21) for \u03c8 in the range of \u03a02 , so that Assumption 2.7 (assuring\nsolvability for general \u03c8) may seem too strong.

Here we shall use the terminology of weakly polyhomogeneous pseudodifferential boundary operators worked out in [G01] (the relevant parts\nsummed up in [G02, Sect. 2]), extending the calculus of Boutet de Monvel [BM71]. One\ncan get quite far with linear combinations of compositions of elementary operators as in\n[GS95], [G99], but when the expressions get increasingly complicated, it seem advantageous to use the systematic calculus. We shall here just recall the basic definitions in the\nn\ncase where X, X \u2032 are replaced by R+ , Rn\u22121 .\nOne considers Poisson operators K (mapping functions on Rn+ to functions on Rn\u22121 ),\ntrace operators T of class 0 (mapping functions on Rn\u22121 to functions on Rn+ ) and singular\nGreen operators G of class 0 (mapping functions on Rn+ to functions on Rn+ ), of the form\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nei(x \u2212y )*\u03be k\u0303(x\u2032 , xn , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc)v(y \u2032 ) dy \u2032 d\u2013\u03be \u2032 ,\nK = OPK(k\u0303) : v(x ) 7\u2192\n2(n\u22121)\nZ R\nZ \u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nT = OPT(t\u0303) : u(x) 7\u2192\nei(x \u2212y )*\u03be t\u0303(x\u2032 , xn , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc)u(y \u2032 , xn ) dxn dy \u2032 d\u2013\u03be \u2032 ,\n(2.26)\n2(n\u22121)\nZR\nZ0 \u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nei(x \u2212y )*\u03be g\u0303(x\u2032 , xn , yn , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc)u(y) dyd\u2013\u03be \u2032.\nG = OPG(g\u0303) : u(x) 7\u2192\nR2(n\u22121)\n\n0\n\nNote that the usual \u03c8do definition is used with respect to the x\u2032 -variable. In fact, we can\nview OPK, OPT and OPG as OPKn OP\u2032 , OPTn OP\u2032 resp. OPGn OP\u2032 , where OPKn etc.\nstand for the application of (2.26) with respect to xn -variables alone.\nThe functions k\u0303, t\u0303 and g\u0303 are called the symbol-kernels of K, T , resp. G. There is also\na \"complex formulation\", where e.g. the symbol-kernel k\u0303(x\u2032 , xn , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) is replaced by the\nsymbol k(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 , \u03ben , \u03bc) = Fxn \u2192\u03ben k\u0303, and F\u03be\u22121\nis included in the definition of the operator\nn \u2192xn\n(F denotes Fourier transformation).\nWe say that k\u0303 \u2208 S m,d,s (\u039b, S+ ), resp. g\u0303 \u2208 S m,d,s (\u039b, S++ ), when\n(2.27)\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nj\n(z d \u03ba\u2212s\u22121 hz\u03be \u2032 il\u2212l uln \u2202ul n k\u0303(x\u2032 , |z|un , \u03be \u2032 , 1/z))| \u2264 Ch\u03be \u2032 im+j , resp.\nsup |\u2202|z|\n\nun \u2208R+\n\nsup\nun ,vn \u2208R+\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nj\n(z d \u03ba\u2212s\u22122 hz\u03be \u2032 il\u2212l +k\u2212k uln \u2202ul n vnk \u2202vkn g\u0303(x\u2032 , |z|un , |z|vn , \u03be \u2032 , 1/z))| \u2264 Ch\u03be \u2032 im+j ,\n|\u2202|z|\n\nfor all indices, uniformly for |z| \u2264 1, z1 in closed subsectors of \u039b, with similar estimates for\n1\n1\nthe derivatives \u2202\u03be\u03b1\u2032 \u2202x\u03b2\u2032 with m replaced by m\u2212|\u03b1|.

The motivation for the scaling\nxn = |z|un is explained in [G01], where complete and satisfactory composition rules are\nworked out. The operators are defined on X, X \u2032 by standard localization methods.\nWe recall one further operation, that of taking the normal trace trn : When G is a\nsingular Green operator as above, the normal trace trn G is the \u03c8do on Rn\u22121 with symbol\nZ \u221e\n\u2032 \u2032\n(2.28)\n(trn g\u0303)(x , \u03be , \u03bc) =\ng\u0303(x\u2032 , xn , xn , \u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) dxn\n0\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n15\n\n\u2248\n\n(called g in [G96]). Here the symbol map trn acts as follows:\n(2.29)\n\ntrn : S m,d,s\u22121 (\u039b, S++ ) \u2192 S m,d,s (\u039b).\n\nFor operators of trace class,\n(2.30)\n\nTrRn+ G = TrRn\u22121 (trn G)\n\nR\u221e\n(if G has the kernel K(x, y, \u03bc) then trn G has the kernel 0 K(x\u2032 , xn , y \u2032 , xn , \u03bc) dxn), and\nthere is a similar rule for the operators carried over to the manifold situation, when the\nsymbol-kernel of G is supported in Xc and the volume element on Xc is taken of the form\nv(x\u2032 )dx\u2032 dxn :\n(2.31)\n\nTrX G = TrX \u2032 (trn G).\n\nOne has that G \u2212 \u03c7G\u03c7 is smoothing and O(|\u03bc|\u2212M ) for \u03bc \u2192 \u221e in closed subsectors of \u039b,\nall M , when \u03c7 \u2208 C0\u221e ( ] \u2212 c, c[ ) and is 1 near xn = 0 (cf. e.g. [G01, Lemma 7.1]). Thus in\nthe trace expansion calculations for singular Green operators on X, we can replace G by\n\u03c7G\u03c7 and use (2.31) to reduce to a calculation for a \u03c8do on X \u2032 ; here [GS95, Th. 2.1] can\nbe applied.\nWe shall express the fact that \"the symbol-kernel is in S m,d,s (\u0393\u03b8 , S+ )N\u00d7N resp.\nm,d,s\nS\n(\u0393\u03b8 , S++ )N\u00d7N in local trivializations\" more briefly by saying that the operator lies\nin OPK S m,d,s (\u0393\u03b8 , S+ ), OPT S m,d,s (\u0393\u03b8 , S+ ) resp. OPG S m,d,s (\u0393\u03b8 , S++ ).\nThe symbol-kernels we consider,\nmoreover have expansions in appropriately quasiP\nhomogeneous terms, e.g., g\u0303 \u223c j\u2208N g\u0303m\u2212j with g\u0303m\u2212j \u2208 S m\u2212j,d,s (\u0393\u03b8 , S++ ). There is the\nsame distinction between weakly polyhomogeneous symbol-kernels (with homogeneity for\n|\u03be \u2032 | \u2265 1) and strongly polyhomogeneous symbol-kernels (with homogeneity for |\u03be \u2032 |+|\u03bc| \u2265 1,\netc.) as for \u03c8do symbols.\nThe following elementary examples are basic in our calculations:\n(1) KD (\u2212\u03bc2 ) is a strongly polyhomogeneous Poisson operator in OPK S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393, S+ ).\n(2) \u03b30 Q(\u2212\u03bc2 )+ and \u03b31 Q(\u2212\u03bc2 )+ are strongly polyhomogeneous trace operators of class\n0 in OPT S 0,0,\u22122 (\u0393, S+ ) resp. OPT S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393, S+ ).\nAs mentioned in the proof of Lemma 2.3, KD is principally the same as the operator\nKA : v 7\u2192 e\u2212xn A v, for xn \u2208 Xc (cf. [G02, Prop. 2.11]). We also have (by [G02, (1.17), (4.14)]\nwith A2 replaced by P \u2032 ) that \u03b30 Q+ and \u03b31 Q+ act principally, for functions supported in\nXc , like the operators 12 A\u22121 TA resp. 12 TA , where\nZ \u221e\n(2.32)\nTA u =\ne\u2212xn A u(x\u2032 , xn ) dxn .\n0\n\nSimple examples of singular Green operators are KD \u03b30 Q+ (whose negtive is the singular\nGreen part of RD , cf. (2.13)) and KD \u03b31 Q+ ; they are strongly polyhomogeneous and belong\nto OPG S 0,0,\u22123 (\u0393, S++ ) resp. OPG S 0,0,\u22122 (\u0393, S++ ). 2KD \u03b31 Q+ is (on Xc ) principally equal\nto GA , which acts as follows:\nZ \u221e\n(2.33)\nGA u =\ne\u2212(xn +yn )A u(x\u2032 , yn ) dyn .\n0\n\nFor the latter, trn is easy to determine by functional calculus:\nZ \u221e\n(2.34)\ntrn GA =\ne\u22122xn A dxn = (2A)\u22121 ;\n0\n\nthis kind of calculation plays a role in our analysis of trace coefficients in Section 4.\n\n\f16\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nTheorem 2.10. Let Assumptions 1.1, 2.4 and 2.7 hold. Then for each \u03b8 \u2032 \u2208 ]0, \u03b8[ there is\nan r = r(\u03b8 \u2032 ) \u2265 0 such that for \u03bc \u2208 \u0393\u03b8\u2032 ,r , PT + \u03bc2 = PT \u2212 \u03bb is a bijection from D(PT ) to\nL2 (E) with inverse (PT \u2212 \u03bb)\u22121 = RT (\u03bb) of the form\n(2.35)\n\nRT (\u03bb) = Q(\u03bb)+ + G(\u03bb),\nG(\u03bb) = \u2212KD (\u03bb)\u03b30 Q(\u03bb)+ + KD (\u03bb)[S0 (\u03bb)\u03b30 + S1 (\u03bb)\u03b31 ]Q(\u03bb)+ ;\n\nhere S0 and S1 (given in (2.36) below) are weakly polyhomogeneous \u03c8do's in E \u2032 lying in\nOP\u2032 S 0,0,0 (\u0393\u03b8 ) resp. OP\u2032 S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393\u03b8 ), and hence G is a singular Green operator of class 0\nin OPG S 0,0,\u22123 (\u0393\u03b8 , S++ ).\nProof. For a \u03b8 \u2032 \u2208 ]0, \u03b8[ , take r = r(\u03b8 \u2032 ) such that ADN is well-defined and the operators\nS(\u03bb) and S \u2032 (\u03bb) are invertible for \u03bb = \u2212\u03bc2 , \u03bc \u2208 \u0393\u03b8\u2032 ,r . Then (2.17) is solved uniquely by\n(2.19), and it remains to draw the conclusions for the original problem (2.12). In view of\n(2.13), (2.14) and (2.19), the solution is:\nu = v + z = RD f + KD \u03c6\n= RD f \u2212 KD S \u22121 \u03a02 \u03b31 RD f\n\n= Q+ f \u2212 KD \u03b30 Q+ f \u2212 KD S \u22121 \u03a02 \u03b31 Q+ f + KD S \u22121 \u03a02 ADN \u03b30 Q+ f.\nThis shows (2.35) with\n(2.36)\n\nS0 = S \u22121 \u03a02 ADN ,\n\nS1 = \u2212S \u22121 \u03a02 ;\n\nthey lie in OP\u2032 S 0,0,0 (\u0393\u03b8 ) resp. OP\u2032 S 0,0,\u22121 (\u0393\u03b8 ) by the rules of calculus. The statement on\nG now follows from the information given before the theorem on KD , \u03b30 Q+ and \u03b31 Q+ ,\nand the composition rules. \u0003\nRemark 2.11.

When \u03bc runs\n1\nthrough \u0393\u03b8,\u00b1 \u222a {0}, then (a21 + \u03bc2 ) 2 runs through a convex subset Va1 ,\u00b1 of \u0393\u03b8,\u00b1 lying to\nthe right of a curve Ca1 ,\u00b1 passing through a1 on the real axis.\n1\nSince aj \u2265 a1 for j \u2265 1, we also have that (a2j + \u03bc2 ) 2 lies in Va1 ,\u00b1 when \u03bc \u2208 \u0393\u03b8,\u00b1 \u222a {0}.\nWe denote Va1 ,+ \u222a Va1 ,\u2212 = Va1 .

(i) is the special case of (ii) where m\u2032 = 0, so we can treat them at the same\ntime.

By Corollary 2.12 and the composition\n\u2032\n\u2032\nrules it lies in OPG S 0,0,m \u22122m\u22121 (\u0393\u03b8 ) in general, and in OPG S m ,0,\u22122m\u22121 (\u0393\u03b8 ) if F is\ntangential. With a cut-off function \u03c7 as after (2.31), we have that Tr(F G(m) \u2212 \u03c7F G(m) \u03c7)\nis O(|\u03bc|\u2212M ) for \u03bc \u2192 \u221e in closed subsectors of \u0393\u03b8 , all M ; this difference does not contribute\nto the trace expansion, so it suffices to treat \u03c7F G(m) \u03c7. This operator can be considered\n0\n= X \u2032 \u00d7 R+ , with the same symbol-kernel estimates as\nas a singular Green operator on X+\nindicated above.

It is an important point in that theorem that one gets\na sum of two expansions\n(2.46)\n\nX\nj\u22650\n\ncj \u03bcM0 \u2212j +\n\nX\n\n(c\u2032k log \u03bc + c\u2032\u2032k )\u03bcM1 \u2212k ,\n\nk\u22650\n\nwhere M0 equals the dimension (here n \u2212 1) plus the order of the operator (here m\u2032 \u2212 2m),\nand M1 equals the lowest d-index associated with the operator. The coefficients cj and\nc\u2032k are local (each stems from a specific homogeneous term in the symbol), whereas the c\u2032\u2032k\nare global in the sense that they depend on the full structure. So in the application to\n\u2032\nS, the first series begins with a term c\u03bcn\u22121+m \u22122m , and the second series begins with a\n\u2032\nterm (c\u2032 log \u03bc + c\u2032\u2032 )\u03bcm \u22122m for general F , (c\u2032 log \u03bc + c\u2032\u2032 )\u03bc\u22122m for tangential F . Adding the\n1\nexpansions and inserting \u03bc = (\u2212\u03bb) 2 , we find the expansion (2.35) ff. after an adjustment\nof the indexation. \u0003\nRemark 2.14. One has in particular that when all the occurring operators are strongly\npolyhomogeneous, there is only the first expansion in (2.46), no logarithmic or global\nterms.

(The passage from the \u03bb-framework to the t-framework is essentially an\n\n\f20\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\ninverse Laplace transformation; here products are turned into convolutions, as is usual for\nsuch integral transforms.)\nAs shown e.g. in [GS96] (or see Sect. 2 of [G97]), the transition formula likewise applies to\nthe trace expansions, carrying the expansions in Theorem 2.13 over to heat trace expansions\nwith logarithms.

As noted in Theorem 2.13, the part \u03c6(Qm )+ of \u03c6RTm contributes only a local power\nexpansion, and \u03c6G(m) contributes the same expansion as \u03c7\u03c6G(m) \u03c7, so it suffices to study\nTrX \u2032 trn (\u03c7\u03c6G(m) \u03c7), where we can use (4.1). Here the strongly polyhomogeneous part S1\ngives an expansion with purely local power terms (as in (2.47) with k \u2265 1 \u2212 n and m\u2032 = 0),\nand the term S2 with symbol in S 1,0,\u22121\u22122m (\u0393\u03b8 ) \u2282 S \u22122m,0,0 (\u0393\u03b8 ) \u2229 S 1,\u22121\u22122m,0 (\u0393\u03b8 ) gives\nan expansion as in (2.46) with M0 = n \u2212 2m and M1 = \u22121 \u2212 2m. So the non-local and\n1\nlog-contributions from S1 + S2 begin with a term (c\u2032 log(\u2212\u03bb) + c\u2032\u2032 )(\u2212\u03bb)\u2212 2 \u2212m , implying\n(4.9).\nThe identification of c\u20320 (\u03c6) with 21 times the noncommutative residue res( 12 \u03c6\u03a02 ) refers to\nthe work of Wodzicski [W84], [W84\u2032 ], where it was shown that for a classical integer-order\n\u03c8do C in E \u2032 , the following formula:\nZ Z\n\u2212s\n(4.11)\nres(C) = ord Q Ress=0 Tr(CQ ) =\n(trE \u2032 c(x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ))1\u2212n d\u03c3(\u03be \u2032 )\nX\u2032\n\n|\u03be\u2032 |=1\n\ncan be given a sense (the trace Tr is defined as a meromorphic extension from large Re s\nto s \u2208 C, Q is an auxiliary invertible elliptic \u03c8do of positive order, trE \u2032 is the fiber trace,\nand subscript 1 \u2212 n indicates the term of degree 1 \u2212 n = \u2212 dim X \u2032 in the symbol); the\nfunctional res vanishes on commutators.\nIf P \u2032 is invertible, the last equality sign in (4.10) follows directly by taking Q = P \u2032 .

The local contributions at a certain\nindex k come from the homogeneous symbol terms with the degree that matches the index.\n(m)\nSince \u03c6RTm = \u03c6Qm\nis of order \u22122m, local contributions at k = 0 (in (4.9))\n+ + \u03c6G\ncome from terms of homogeneity degree \u22122m \u2212 n in (\u03be, \u03bc) in the symbol of \u03c6Qm and\nterms of homogeneity degree \u22122m \u2212 n + 1 in (\u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) in the symbol of trn \u03c6G(m) , in local\ntrivializations.\n(m)\nis of order \u22122m + 1, local contributions at k = 0 (in\nSince D1 RTm = D1 Qm\n+ + D1 G\n(4.15)) come from terms of homogeneity degree \u22122m + 1 \u2212 n in (\u03be, \u03bc) in the symbol of\nD1 Qm and terms of homogeneity degree \u22122m\u2212n+2 in (\u03be \u2032 , \u03bc) in the symbol of trn D1 G(m) ,\nin local trivializations.\nThese contributions can be traced back to the symbols of \u03c6 and P , resp. \u03c8, P and D1\nat xn = 0, and the xn -derivatives up to order n at xn = 0 of the symbol of P (resp. P and\nD1 ), together with the first n homogeneous terms (down to order 1 \u2212 n) in the symbol of\n\u03a02 (or \u03a01 ).\nIn many cases one can show that the first log-coefficient vanishes and get some information on the nonlocal content of the coefficient behind it.\nWe first observe:\nTheorem 4.5. We always have that a\u20320 (I) = 0. Moreover, a\u20320 (\u03c6) = 0 if \u03c6\u03a02 is a projection, and a\u20320 (D1 ) = 0 if \u03c8\u03a02 is a projection.\nProof. This follows from the fact, observed already by Wodzicki in [W84], [W84\u2032 ], that\nwhen \u03a0 is a \u03c8do projection, then res(\u03a0) = 0. The three statements in the theorem follow\nby applying this to the formulas shown above:\na\u20320 (I) = c\u20320 (I) =\n(4.20)\n\na\u20320 (\u03c6) = c\u20320 (\u03c6) =\n\n1\nres(\u03a02 ),\n4\n1\nres(\u03c6\u03a02 ),\n4\n\na\u20320 (D1 ) = d\u20320 (\u03c8) = \u03b1 res(\u03c8\u03a02 );\nthey give 0 when the operator to which res is applied is a projection.\n\n\u0003\n\nOther systematic results can be obtained when \u03a01 is a spectral projection or a suitable\nperturbation of such an operator.\nDefinition 4.6. A pseudodifferential orthogonal projection \u03a0 in L2 (E \u2032 ) will be said to be\na spectral projection associated with C, when C is a selfadjoint first-order elliptic classical\n\u03c8do in E \u2032 and \u03a0 satisfies\n(4.21)\n\n\u03a0 = \u03a0> (C) + \u03a0V0\u2032 ,\n\nwhere \u03a0> (C) is the orthogonal projection onto the positive eigenpace of C and \u03a0V0\u2032 is\nthe orthogonal projection onto a subspace V0\u2032 of V0 (C) (the nullspace of C). We denote\nV0 (C) \u2296 V0\u2032 = V0\u2032\u2032 .\nIt is shown below in Proposition 4.8 that for any orthogonal \u03c8do projection \u03a0 there\nexists an invertible C such that \u03a0 = \u03a0> (C).\nA particular result is the following:\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n27\n\nTheorem 4.7. Let\n(4.22)\n\n\u03a01 = \u03a0> (C) + S,\n\nwhere C is a selfadjoint elliptic differential operator of order 1 and S is a \u03c8do of order\n\u2264 \u2212n. If n is odd, then res(\u03c6\u03a02 ) and res(\u03c8\u03a02 ) are zero and hence \u00e3\u20320 (\u03c6) and \u00e3\u20320 (D1 ) in\n(4.9), (4.15) are zero.\nProof. We have that \u03c6\u03a02 = \u03c6\u03a0\u2264 (C) \u2212 \u03c6S, where\n(4.23)\n\n\u03a0\u2264 (C) =\n\n|C|\u2212C\n2|C \u2032 |\n\n+ \u03a00 (C) = 21 (I \u2212\n\nC\n|C \u2032 |\n\n+ \u03a00 (C)), with C \u2032 = C + \u03a00 (C).\n\nHere 21 \u03c6, \u03c6\u03a00 and \u03c6S have residue 0, since they have no 1 \u2212 n-degree term in the symbol.\nThe symbol of |CC\u2032 | has even-odd parity (the terms of even degree of homogeneity order\nare odd in \u03be \u2032 and vice versa; more on such symbols e.g. in [G02, Sect. 5]), and so does\nthe symbol composed with \u03c6. Thus, when the interior dimension n is odd, the term of\norder 1 \u2212 n in the symbol is odd in \u03be \u2032 , so the integration with respect to \u03be \u2032 in (4.11) gives\nzero. \u0003\nBefore considering the more delicate results on the term a\u2032\u20320 , we include some words\nabout \u03c8do projections.\nProposition 4.8.\n(i) When \u03a0 is a \u03c8do projection in L2 (E \u2032 ), then\n\u03a0ort = \u03a0\u03a0\u2217 [\u03a0\u03a0\u2217 + (I \u2212 \u03a0\u2217 )(I \u2212 \u03a0)]\u22121\n\n(4.24)\n\nis an orthogonal \u03c8do projection with the same range. Moreover,\n(4.25)\n\nR = \u03a0 + (I \u2212 \u03a0ort )(I \u2212 \u03a0)\n\nis an invertible elliptic zero-order \u03c8do (with inverse \u03a0ort + (I \u2212 \u03a0)(I \u2212 \u03a0ort )) such that\n\u03a0ort = R\u03a0R\u22121 .\n\n(4.26)\n\n(ii) Let \u03a0 be an orthogonal \u03c8do projection in L2 (E \u2032 ). There exists a selfadjoint invertible\nelliptic \u03c8do C of order 1 in E \u2032 such that \u03a0 = \u03a0> (C).\nProof. (i). The formula (4.24) is known from Birman and Solomyak [BS82], details of\nverification can also be found in Booss-Bavnbek and Wojciechowski [BW93, Lemma 12.8].\nThe statements on R are easily checked.\n(ii). If the principal symbol \u03c0 0 equals the identity or 0, we are in a trivial case, so let\nus assume that \u03c0 0 6= I and 0; then \u03a0 and \u03a0\u22a5 both have infinite dimensional range. Let\nC1 be a selfadjoint positive first-order elliptic \u03c8do with scalar principal symbol c01 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 )\n(e.g. = |\u03be \u2032 |). Let\nC \u2032 = \u03a0C1 \u03a0 \u2212 \u03a0\u22a5 C1 \u03a0\u22a5 .\nC \u2032 is a \u03c8do of order 1 with principal symbol\n0\n\nc\u2032 = \u03c0 0 c01 \u03c0 0 \u2212 (I \u2212 \u03c0 0 )c01 (I \u2212 \u03c0 0 ) = (2\u03c0 0 \u2212 I)c01 ,\n\n\f28\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nwhich is invertible since 2\u03c0 0 \u2212 I and c01 are so. Clearly, C \u2032 is selfadjoint, and \u03a0C1 \u03a0 \u2265 0,\n\u03a0\u22a5 C1 \u03a0\u22a5 \u2265 0 in view of the positivity of C1 . Moreover, \u03a0 commutes with C \u2032 .\nSince C \u2032 is selfadjoint elliptic, it has a spectral decomposition in smooth orthogonal\nfinite dimensional eigenspaces Vk with mutually distinct eigenvalues \u03bbk , k \u2208 Z, such that\n\u03bbk < 0 for k < 0, \u03bbk > 0 for k > 0, \u03bb0 = 0 (V0 may be 0). The positive resp. negative\neigenspace of C \u2032 is V> = \u2295k>0 Vk resp. V< = \u2295k<0 Vk . The eigenspaces are invariant under\n\u03a0: For uk \u2208 Vk ,\nC \u2032 \u03a0uk = \u03a0C \u2032 uk = \u03a0\u03bbk uk = \u03bbk \u03a0uk ;\nhence \u03a0uk \u2208 Vk . Now if uk \u2208 Vk \\ {0} with k < 0, then \u03a0uk must be zero, for otherwise\n(C \u2032 \u03a0uk , \u03a0uk ) = \u03bbk k\u03a0uk k2 < 0,\nin contrast with\n(C \u2032 \u03a0uk , \u03a0uk ) = (\u03a0C1 \u03a0\u03a0uk , \u03a0uk ) = (C1 \u03a0uk , \u03a0uk ) \u2265 ck\u03a0uk k2 > 0;\nhere c > 0 is the lower bound of C1 . Thus V< \u2282 R(\u03a0\u22a5 ). Similarly, V> \u2282 R(\u03a0).\nFinally, let \u03a00+ be the orthogonal projection onto \u03a0V0 , let \u03a00\u2212 be the orthogonal\nprojection onto \u03a0\u22a5 V0 (note that V0 = \u03a0V0 \u2295 \u03a0\u22a5 V0 since \u03a0V0 \u2282 V0 ), and set\nC = C \u2032 + \u03a00+ \u2212 \u03a00\u2212 ;\nit is injective. Then V> (C) = V> (C \u2032 ) \u2295 \u03a0V0 \u2282 R(\u03a0) and V< (C) = V< (C \u2032 ) \u2295 \u03a0\u22a5 V0 \u2282\nR(\u03a0\u22a5 ), so since they are complementing subspaces, they equal R(\u03a0) resp. R(\u03a0\u22a5 ), and C\nis as asserted. \u0003\nParts of the above proof details are given in Br\u00fcning and Lesch [BL99, Lemma 2.6].\nThey can be used to show the fact that res(\u03a0) = 0 for any \u03c8do projection, that we used\nabove in Theorem 4.5. In fact, with the notation of the proposition, we have since res\nvanishes on commutators,\n(4.27)\n\nres(\u03a0) = res(R\u22121 \u03a0ort R) = res(\u03a0ort ) = res(\u03a0> (C)) =\n=\n\n1\n2\n\nres(C|C|\u22121 ) =\n\n1\n2\n\nRess=0 Tr(C|C|\n\n1\n2\n\u2212s\u22121\n\nres(I + C|C|\u22121 )\n\n)=\n\n1\n2\n\nRess=0 \u03b7(C, s) = 0,\n\nwhere the last equality follows from the vanishing of the eta residue of C shown by Atiyah,\nPatodi and Singer [APS76] (odd dimensions) and Gilkey [Gi81]. (The relation between the\nvanishing of the noncommutative residue on projections, and the vanishing of eta residues,\nenters also in [W84].)\nTheorem 4.9. Let \u03a01 be an orthogonal pseudodifferential projection, and let C be a firstorder selfadjoint elliptic \u03c8do such that \u03a01 = \u03a0> (C) + \u03a0V0\u2032 as in Definition 4.6.

Then in view of Green's formula:\n(5.1)\n\n(Du, v)X \u2212 (u, D\u2217 v)X = \u2212(\u03c3\u03b30 u, \u03b30 v)X \u2032 , for u \u2208 C \u221e (E1 ), v \u2208 C \u221e (E2 ),\n\nthe adjoint (D\u03a0 )\u2217 is the realization of D\u2217 (of the form (\u2212\u2202xn + A + xn A21 + A20 )\u03c3 \u2217 on Xc )\ndefined by the boundary condition \u03a0\u22a5 \u03c3 \u2217 \u03b30 v = 0 (associated with the well-posed projection\n\u03a0\u2032 = \u03c3\u03a0\u22a5 \u03c3 \u2217 for D\u2217 ). It follows that D\u2217 D is of the form (1.1) with P \u2032 = A2 , and that\nD\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 is the realization of D\u2217 D defined by the boundary condition\n(5.2)\n\n\u03a0\u03b30 u = 0,\n\n\u03a0\u22a5 (\u03b31 u + A1 (0)\u03b30 u) = 0.\n\nThus D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 is of the type PT considered in Sections 1\u20134, with P = D\u2217 D, P \u2032 = A2 ,\n\u03a01 = \u03a0 and B = A1 (0). Note that the symbol considered in Assumption 2.7 is here\n(5.3)\n\n1\n\n((a0 )2 + \u03bc2 ) 2 \u2212 (I \u2212 \u03c0 h )a0 (I \u2212 \u03c0 h ).\n\nWhen the principal symbols of \u03a0 and A2 commute, Assumption 2.7 is essentially equivalent with well-posedness. More precisely, we have:\nLemma 5.1. Let \u03a0 be an orthogonal \u03c8do projection in L2 (E1\u2032 ) and let PT be the realization\nof D\u2217 D under the boundary condition (5.2), and assume that the principal symbols of \u03a0\nand A2 commute.\n1\u25e6 When \u03a0 is well-posed for D, then Assumption 2.7 holds for {P, T } with \u03b8 = \u03c02 .\n2\u25e6 If Assumption 2.7 holds for {P, T } with some \u03b8 > 0 and \u03c0 0 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 ) has rank N/2,\nthen \u03a0 is well-posed for D.\nProof. 1\u25e6 . Fix x\u2032 , |\u03be \u2032 | \u2265 1, and consider the model realization d0\u03c0 0 (defined for the ordinary\ndifferential operator d0 = \u03c3(x\u2032 )(\u2202xn + a0 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 )) in L2 (R+ , CN ) by the boundary condition\n\u03c0 0 (x\u2032 , \u03be \u2032 )u(0) = 0), and the model realization p0t0 (defined similarly from principal symbols). The well-posedness assures that d0\u03c0 0 is injective, hence p0t0 = (d0\u03c0 0 )\u2217 d0\u03c0 0 is selfadjoint\npositive, as an unbounded operator in L2 (R+ , CN ). It follows that p0t0 \u2212 \u03bb is bijective from\nits domain to L2 (R+ , CN ), for all \u03bb \u2208 C \\ R+ . Using that \u03c0 0 commutes with (a0 )2 , we\ncan carry out the calculations in the proof of Lemma 2.6 for the model problem (without\ncommutation error terms), which allows us to conclude that the equation in CN :\n(5.4)\n\n1\n\n[((a0 )2 \u2212 \u03bb) 2 \u2212 (I \u2212 \u03c0 0 )a0 (I \u2212 \u03c0 0 )]\u03c6 = \u03c8,\n\nis uniquely solvable for \u03c8 \u2208 R(I \u2212 \u03c0 0 ). Moreover, the calculations in Remark 2.9 on the\nmodel level extend the solvability of (5.4) to all \u03c8 \u2208 CN . The invertibility property extends\nreadily to the strictly homogeneous symbols for \u03be \u2032 6= 0, it is obvious for \u03be \u2032 = 0 with \u03bb 6= 0.\n2\u25e6 . Assumption 2.7 gives for \u03bc = 0, |\u03be \u2032 | \u2265 1, that p0t0 = (d0\u03c0 0 )\u2217 d0\u03c0 0 is bijective. This\nimplies injectiveness of d0\u03c0 0 , i.e., injective ellipticity of {d0 , \u03c0 0 \u03b30 }. Then well-posedness\nholds exactly when \u03c0 0 has rank N/2. (One may consult [G99, p. 55].)\n\n\f32\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nExample 5.2. When \u03a0 is taken as \u03a0\u2265 + S with S of order \u22121 (cf. Example 1.2), \u03c0 0\ncommutes with a0 itself, and we see directly that Assumption 2.7 holds simply because\n\u2212(I \u2212 \u03c0 h )a0 (I \u2212 \u03c0 h ) \u2265 0. - For the projections \u03a0(\u03b8) = P (\u03b8) introduced by Br\u00fcning and\nLesch in [BL99], Assumption 2.7 is also directly verifiable, since the conditions of [BL99]\nassure that \u2212(I \u2212 \u03c0 h )a0 (I \u2212 \u03c0 h ) \u2212 c|a0 | \u2265 0 for some c > \u22121. Here \u03a0(\u03b8) commutes with\nA2 . Again, perturbations of order \u22121 are allowed.\n\nThus the results of Section 2\u20134 apply to D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 with \u0393\u03b8 = \u0393. So there are expansions\n(2.43), (3.4) and (3.9) for\nTr(\u03c6(D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m ),\n\nTr(\u03c6e\u2212tD\u03a0\n\n\u2217\n\nD\u03a0\n\n),\n\nand \u0393(s) Tr(\u03c6(D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 )\u2212s ) = \u0393(s)\u03b6(\u03c6, D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 , s),\nand, with the choice F = \u033aD (\u033a a morphism from E2 to E1 ), there are expansions as in\n(2.35), (3.5) and (3.11)\u2013(3.12) for\nTr(\u033aD(D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m ),\n\nTr(\u033aDe\u2212tD\u03a0\n\n\u2217\n\u2212\nand \u0393( s+1\n2 ) Tr(\u033aD(D\u03a0 D\u03a0 )\n\n\u2217\n\nD\u03a0\n\ns+1\n2\n\n),\n\n\u0393(s) Tr(\u033aD(D\u03a0 \u2217 D\u03a0 )\u2212s ),\n\n) = \u0393( s+1\n2 )\u03b7(\u033a, D\u03a0 , s).\n\nSuch expansions were shown in [G99] by a different procedure where D was regarded as\npart of a first-order system of the double size.\nWe get new results by drawing some consequences for the coefficients at k = 0 from\nSection 4.\nBefore doing this, let us also briefly look at D\u03a0 D\u03a0 \u2217 . It is easily checked that \u03c3 \u2217 DD\u2217 \u03c3\nis of the form (1.1), and that \u03c3 \u2217 D\u03a0 D\u03a0 \u2217 \u03c3 is the realization of it with boundary condition\n(5.5)\n\n\u03a0\u22a5 \u03b30 u = 0,\n\n\u03a0(\u03b31 u \u2212 (A + A20 (0))\u03b30 u) = 0.\n\nIn the consideration of trace formulas for D\u03a0 D\u03a0 \u2217 , a composition to the left with \u03c3 and to\nthe right with \u03c3 \u2217 leaves the formulas corresponding to (2.43), (3.4) and (3.9) unchanged\nif \u03c6 = I.\nTheorems 4.5 and 4.7 imply immediately:\n\u2217\nCorollary 5.3. Let PT = D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , where D is as in Example 1.2, \u03a0 is well-posed for D,\nand the principal symbols of \u03a0 and A2 commute.\n(i) For the expansions (2.43), (3.4), (3.9), related to the zeta function,\n\n(5.6)\n\n\u00e3\u20320 (I) = a\u20320 (I) = 0.\n\nMoreover,\n(5.7)\n\n\u00e3\u20320 (\u03c6) = a\u20320 (\u03c6) =\n\n1\n4\n\nres(\u03c6\u03a0\u22a5 );\n\nit is zero in the following cases (a) and (b):\n(a) \u03c6\u03a0\u22a5 is a projection,\n(b) n is odd and \u03a0\u22a5 = \u03a0> (C) + S for some first-order selfadjoint elliptic differential\noperator C of order 1, S of order \u2212n.\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n33\n\n(ii) For the expansions (2.35), (3.5), (3.11)\u2013(3.12) with F = \u033aD, related to the eta function,\n(5.8)\n\n\u00e3\u20320 (\u033aD) = a\u20320 (\u033aD) = \u03b1 res(\u033a\u03c3\u03a0\u22a5 );\n\nit is zero if \u033a\u03c3\u03a0\u22a5 is a projection, or if (b) holds.\n\u2217\nNote that (5.6) means that the zeta function of D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 is regular at zero. Since the\nhypotheses assuring this (once D is taken of the form (1.6)), are entirely concerned with\nprincipal symbols, we have in particular: The regularity of the zeta function at s = 0 is\npreserved under perturbations of \u03a0 of order \u22121. When [\u03c0 0 , (a0 )2 ] = 0, this is a far better\nresult than that of [G01\u2032 ], where it was shown for perturbations of order \u2212n.\nWe also have from Theorem 4.9 and the following considerations:\n\nCorollary 5.4. Assumptions as in Corollary 5.3. Let \u03a0 be a spectral projection as in\nDefinition 4.6, with the notation introduced there and in Definition 4.10. Then in the\nexpansions (2.43), (3.4), (3.9),\n(5.9)\n(5.10)\n\na\u2032\u20320 (I) = \u2212 14 \u03b7C,V0\u2032 + local contributions,\n\n\u2217\n\u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0) = \u2212 14 \u03b7C,V0\u2032 \u2212 dim V0 (D\u03a0 ) + local contributions.\n\n\u2217\nThere is a similar result for D\u03a0 D\u03a0\n; here \u03a0 is replaced by \u03a0\u22a5 = \u03a0> (\u2212C) + \u03a0V0\u2032\u2032 in view\n\u2217\nof the remarks above on D\u03a0 D\u03a0\n. So in this case, Theorem 4.9 gives:\n\n(5.11)\n\n\u2217\na\u2032\u20320 (I)(D\u03a0 D\u03a0\n) = \u2212 14 (\u2212\u03b7(C, 0) + dim V0\u2032\u2032 \u2212 dim V0\u2032 ) + local contributions\n\n= 14 \u03b7C,V0\u2032 + local contributions,\n\nObserve moreover that since\n(5.12)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nindex D\u03a0 = Tr e\u2212tD\u03a0 D\u03a0 \u2212 Tr e\u2212tD\u03a0 D\u03a0 = a\u2032\u20320 (I)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 ) \u2212 a\u2032\u20320 (I)(D\u03a0 D\u03a0\n),\n\nwe find:\nCorollary 5.5. In the situation of Corollary 5.4,\n(5.13)\n\nindex D\u03a0 = \u2212 12 \u03b7C,V0\u2032 + local contributions.\n\nFor the case where \u03a0 = \u03a0\u2265 (A) (cf. (4.34)), (5.13) is known from [APS75], and (5.9)\nis known from [G92]; for \u03a0 = \u03a0> (A) + \u03a0V0\u2032 in the product case, cf. [GS96, Cor. 3.7].\nWe believe that it is an interesting new result that for rather general projections, the\nnon-locality depends only on the projection, not the interior operator, in this sense.\nNow we turn to cases with selfadjointness properties. We are here both interested in\ntruly selfadjoint product cases and in nonproduct cases where D is principally selfadjoint\nat X \u2032 . Along with D we consider the operator of product type D0 defined by\n(5.14)\n\nD0 = \u03c3(\u2202xn + A) on Xc , so that D = D0 + \u03c3(xn A11 + A10 ).\n\n\f34\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nIn addition to the requirements that \u03c3 be unitary and A be selfadjoint, we now assume\nthat E1 = E2 and that D0 is formally selfadjoint on Xc when this is provided with the\n\"product\" volume element v(x\u2032 , 0)dx\u2032 dxn ; this means that\n(5.15)\n\n\u03c3 2 = \u2212I,\n\n\u03c3A = \u2212A\u03c3.\n\nD0 can always be extended to an elliptic operator on X (e.g. by use of D); let us denote\nthe extension D0 also. If the extension is selfadjoint, we call this a selfadjoint product case.\nWhen \u03a0 is an orthogonal projection in L2 (E1\u2032 ) = L2 (E2\u2032 ), it is well-posed for D if and\nonly if it is so for D0 . For D0 in selfadjoint product cases, some choices of \u03a0 will lead to\nselfadjoint realizations D0,\u03a0 , namely (in view of (5.1)) those for which\n(5.16)\n\n\u03a0 = \u2212\u03c3\u03a0\u22a5 \u03c3.\n\nThe properties (5.15) and (5.16) imply (4.37) with P \u2032 = A2 , \u03a01 = \u03a0, so we can apply\n\u2217\n2\nTheorem 4.11 to D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 (and D0,\u03a0\n).\nAs pointed out in the appendix A.1 of Douglas and Wojciechowski [DW91], it follows\nfrom Ch. 17 (by Palais and Seeley) of Palais [P65] that when (5.15) holds and n is odd,\nthere exists a subspace L of V0 (A) such that \u03c3L \u22a5 L and V0 (A) = L \u2295 \u03c3L. M\u00fcller showed\nin [M94] (cf. (1.5)ff. and Prop. 4.26 there) that such L can be found in any dimension.\nDenoting the orthogonal projection onto L by \u03a0L , we have that\n(5.17)\n\n\u03a0+ = \u03a0> (A) + \u03a0L\n\nsatisfies (5.16). The projections \u03a0(\u03b8) introduced by Br\u00fcning and Lesch [BL99] likewise\nsatisfy (5.16).\nWe here conclude from Theorem 4.11:\nCorollary 5.6. In addition to the assumptions of Corollary 5.3, assume that E1 = E2\n\u2217\nand that (5.15), (5.16) hold. Then in (2.43), (3.4), (3.9) for PT = D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (I) (= a\u2032\u20320 (I))\n\u2217\nis locally determined. Equivalently, the value of \u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , s) at zero satisfies:\n(5.18)\n\n\u2217\n\u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0) = \u2212 dim V0 (D\u03a0 ) + local contributions.\n\nWe use this to show for the zeta function:\nTheorem 5.7. In addition to the hypotheses of Corollary 5.6, assume that\n(5.19)\n\n\u03a0 = \u03a0 + S,\n\nwhere \u03a0 is a fixed well-posed projection satisfying (5.16) and S is of order \u2264 \u2212n. (\u03a0 can\nin particular be taken as \u03a0+ in (5.17) or \u03a0(\u03b8) from [BL99].)\nThen the \u00e3\u2032\u20320 -terms (and a\u2032\u20320 -terms) in (2.43), (3.4), (3.9) for D\u03a0 and D\u03a0 are the same,\n(5.20)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nD\u03a0 ),\n\u00e3\u2032\u20320 (I)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 ) = \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (I)(D\u03a0\n\nso\n(5.21)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0) + dim V0 (D\u03a0 ) = \u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0) + dim V0 (D\u03a0 ),\n\n\fSPECTRAL BOUNDARY CONDITIONS\n\n35\n\nand in particular,\n(5.22)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0) = \u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0)\n\n(mod Z).\n\nProof. We shall combine the fact that \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (I) is locally determined with order considerations.\nLet\n(5.23)\n\n\u2217\nD\u03a0 \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m ,\nRTm = (D\u03a0\n\n\u2217\nRTm = (D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m .\n\nNote that they have the same pseudodifferential part (D\u2217 D \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m\n+ , so their difference\nm\nm\n\u2032\nRT \u2212 RT is a singular Green operator. It is shown in [G01 , proof of Th. 1] that when S\nis of order \u2212n, the \u03c8do trn (RTm \u2212 RTm ) on X \u2032 has symbol in S \u2212m\u2212n,\u2212m,0 \u2229 S \u2212n,\u22122m,0 . The\ntotal order is \u2212n \u2212 2m, so the highest degree of the homogeneous terms in the symbol is\n\u2212n \u2212 2m. As noted in Remark 4.4, the local contribution to the terms with index k = 0 in\nthe trace expansion of this difference comes from homogeneous terms of degree 1 \u2212 n \u2212 2m\n(recall that dim X \u2032 = n \u2212 1), so since the terms consist purely of local contributions, they\nmust vanish. This shows (5.20), and the other consequences are immediate. \u0003\n\u2217\nIn a language frequently used in this connection, the statement means that \u03b6(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , 0)+\ndim V0 (D\u03a0 ) is constant on the Grassmannian of \u03c8do projections satisfying (5.16) and\ndiffering from \u03a0 by a term of order \u2264 \u2212 dim X.\nWhen D equals D0 in a selfadjoint product case, Wojciechowski shows a result like\nthis in [W99, Sect. 3] for perturbations of \u03a0+ of order \u2212\u221e, assuming that D0,\u03a0+ and\nD0,\u03a0 are invertible. The non-invertible case is treated by Y. Lee in the appendix of\n2\n[PW02]; he shows moreover that \u03b6(D0,\u03a0\n, 0) + dim V0 (D0,\u03a0+ ) = 0, so we conclude that\n+\n2\n\u03b6(D0,\u03a0 , 0) + dim V0 (D0,\u03a0 ) = 0 when \u03a0 = \u03a0+ + S.\n\u2217\nWe can also discuss the eta function \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s) = Tr(D(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 )\u2212\nmorphically as in (3.12). First we conclude from Theorem 4.11:\n\ns+1\n2\n\n), extended mero-\n\nCorollary 5.8. Assumptions of Corollary 5.6. In (2.35), (3.5), (3.11)\u2013(3.12) for PT =\n\u2217\nD\u03a0\nD\u03a0 , D1 = D, one has that \u00e3\u20320 (D) = a\u20320 (D) = 0, and \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D) (= a\u2032\u20320 (D)) is locally\ndetermined.\nIn other words, the double pole of \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s) at 0 vanishes and the residue at 0 is locally\ndetermined.\n(It may be observed that when (5.15) holds, the entries in the second line of (4.38)\n1\nvanish identically, since TrX \u2032 (\u03c3\u2202\u03bbm\u22121 (P \u2032 \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212 2 ) = 0.)\nIt is remarkable here that the hypotheses, besides (5.15)\u2013(5.16), only contain requirements on principal symbols (the well-posedness of \u03a0 for D and the commutativity of the\nprincipal symbols of \u03a0 and A2 ). So the result implies in particular that the vanishing\nof the double pole of the eta function is invariant under perturbations of \u03a0 of order \u22121\n(respecting (5.16)). Earlier results have dealt with perturbations of order \u2212\u221e [W99] or\norder \u2212n [G01\u2032 ].\nNow consider the simple pole of \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s) at 0. Here we can generalize the result of\nWojciechowski [W99] on the regularity of the eta function after a perturbation of order\n\u2212\u221e, to perturbations of order \u2212n of general \u03a0:\n\n\f36\n\nGERD GRUBB\n\nTheorem 5.9. Assumptions of Theorem 5.7.\n\u2217\nD\u03a0\nIn (2.35), (3.5), (3.11)\u2013(3.12) with D1 = D, the \u00e3\u2032\u20320 -terms (and a\u2032\u20320 -terms) for D\u03a0\n\u2217\nand D\u03a0 D\u03a0 are the same:\n(5.24)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 ) = \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 );\n\nin other words, Ress=0 \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s) = Ress=0 \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s).\n\u2217\nD\u03a0 ) = 0 (this holds for \u03a0+ and for certain \u03a0(\u03b8) if D equals\nIn particular, if \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D)(D\u03a0\n\u2217\nD0 in a selfadjoint product case), then \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 ) = 0, i.e., the eta function \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s)\nis regular at 0.\nProof. As in the proof of Theorem 5.7, we combine the fact that \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D) is locally determined\nwith order considerations. Consider DRTm and DRTm , cf. (5.23). Since they have the same\nm\nm\npseudodifferential part D(D\u2217 D \u2212 \u03bb)\u2212m\n+ , their difference DRT \u2212 DRT is a singular Green\noperator. It is shown in [G01\u2032 , proof of Th. 1] that when S is of order \u2212n, the \u03c8do\ntrn (DRTm \u2212 DRTm ) on X \u2032 has symbol in S \u2212m\u2212n,1\u2212m,0 \u2229 S \u2212n,1\u22122m,0 . The total order is\n1 \u2212 n \u2212 2m, so the highest degree of the homogeneous terms in the symbol is 1 \u2212 n \u2212 2m.\nNow the local contribution to the terms with index k = 0 in the trace expansion of this\ndifference comes from homogeneous terms of degree 2 \u2212 n \u2212 2m (cf. Remark 4.4), so since\nthe terms contain only local contributions, they must vanish. This shows (5.24).\n\u2217\n\u2217\nIn particular, \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 ) vanishes if \u00e3\u2032\u20320 (D)(D\u03a0\nD\u03a0 ) does so; then the eta function\nfor D\u03a0 is regular at 0. The eta regularity for the case \u03a0 = \u03a0+ , D equal to D0 and\nselfadjoint on X with product volume element on Xc , was shown in [DW91] under the\nassumptions n odd and D compatible; this was extended to general n and not necessarily\ncompatible D in M\u00fcller [M94]. It was shown for certain \u03a0(\u03b8) in [BL99, Th. 3.12]. \u0003\nIn a frequently used terminology, the theorem shows that the residue of the eta function\nis constant on the Grassmannian of \u03c8do projections satisfying (5.16) and differing from \u03a0\nby a term of order \u2264 \u2212 dim X. We do not expect that the order can be lifted further in\ngeneral.\nThe result on the regularity of the eta function at s = 0 for (\u2212n)-order perturbations\nof the product case with \u03a0 = \u03a0+ has been obtained independently by Yue Lei [L02] at\nthe same time as our result, by another analysis based on heat operator formulas.\nThe above results on the vanishing of the eta residue are concerned with situations\nwhere D equals D0 in a selfadjoint product case. However, the fact from Corollary 5.8 that\nRess=0 \u03b7(D\u03a0 , s) is locally determined also in suitable non-product cases, should facilitate\nthe calculation of the residue then. For example, if D = D0 + xn+1\nA31 on Xc with a firstn\norder tangential differential operator A31 , and the volume element satisfies \u2202xj n v(x\u2032 , 0) = 0\nfor 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n, then by [G02, proof of Th. 3.11], the local terms with index k \u2264 0 in the\ndifference between the resolvent powers are determined entirely from the interior operators\nD and D0 . Then when n is even, the contributions to k = 0 vanish simply because of odd\nparity in \u03be; this gives examples where the eta function is regular at 0 in a non-product\nsituation.\nReferences\n[APS75] M.
