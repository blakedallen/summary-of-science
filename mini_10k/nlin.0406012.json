Earlier, we have described new phenomena in\nthis model in one spatial dimension, not found in analogous systems without taxis: reflecting and\nself-splitting waves. Here we identify new phenomena in two spatial dimensions: unusual patterns\nof meander of spirals, partial reflection of waves, swelling wavetips, attachment of free wave ends\nto wave backs, and as a result, a novel mechanism of self-supporting complicated spatio-temporal\nactivity, unknown in reaction-diffusion population models.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTo describe spatio-temporal dynamics of populations one needs, apart from local interaction of\npopulations, to invoke some mechanism of spatial interaction, e.g spread of individuals in space. Often\nthis is done in terms of diffusion, which is a macroscopic way of describing random, non-directed\nmovement of individuals. This makes a population dynamics model a reaction-diffusion system, and\npattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems is well researched. However, living organisms do not\nnecessarily move randomly, and often show some directed movement in response to exogeneous factors,\na behaviour usually described as taxis. Macroscopic representation of taxis yields equations different\nfrom reaction-diffusion systems, and pattern formation in such models has been studied much less.\nOur aim is to elucidate some new pattern formation mechanisms specific to this type of model.\nIn our previous work [1, 2], we have described new phenomenon observed numerically in a reaction-diffusion-taxis\nmodel, with excitable predator-prey local kinetics [3]. In addition to or instead of diffusion, we introduced taxis of\neach species on the other's gradient: predators pursuing prey and prey escaping the predators. We chose excitable\nrather than more traditional limit-cycle predator-prey dynamics, as it is methodologically easier to deal with solitary\npopulation waves than with wavetrains, and identified some new features that are typical in our excitable pursuitevasion model, but unknown or very rare in reaction-diffusion models of similar systems. These include ability of\npropagating waves to penetrate through each other or reflect from impermeable boundaries (rather than simply\nannihilate, as is typical for reaction-diffusion waves), split and emit backward waves.\nThis was done in models with one spatial dimension. In most ecological applications, however, two spatial dimensions\nare be more realistic. In reaction-diffusion systems it is well known that two-dimensional models can demonstrate a\nmuch wider variety of nontrivial solutions than one-dimensional. Thus, in the present paper, we describe phenomenology observed in two-dimensional simulations of our pursuit-evasion excitable predator-prey model. As far as we are\naware, this is the first study of this sort, so rather than giving an exhaustive description, we have identified phenomena\nthat are qualitatively different from what is observed in two-dimensional reaction-diffusion excitable systems.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe consider a two-dimensional version of the model, studied earlier in [1, 2]:\n\u2202P\n= f (P, Z) + D\u22072 P + h\u2212 \u2207 (P \u2207Z) ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202Z\n= g(P, Z) + D\u22072 Z \u2212 h+ \u2207 (Z\u2207P ) ,\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere P (x, y, t) and Z(x, y, t) are biomass densities of the prey and predator populations, h\u2212 is the coefficient determining the taxis of prey down the gradient of predators (evasion), h+ is the coefficient determining the taxis of\npredators up the gradient of prey (pursuit), D is their diffusion coefficient, assumed equal for simplicity, and f and g\nare \"kinetic\" terms, describing local interaction of the species with each other. We assume that this local interaction\ntakes the Truscott-Brindley [3] form,\nf (P, Z) = \u03b2P (1 \u2212 P ) \u2212 ZP 2 /(P 2 + \u03bd 2 ),\ng(P, Z) = \u03b3ZP 2 /(P 2 + \u03bd 2 ) \u2212 wZ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich describes excitable kinetics. Equations (1,2) are solved numerically with the following parameter values: \u03bd =\n0.07, \u03b2 = 1, w = 0.004. Parameters \u03b3 and D have been used in two fixed combinations, (A) \u03b3 = 0.01, D = 0.04, and\n(B) \u03b3 = 0.016, D = 0. Parameters h\u2212 , h+ varied between simulations. From one-dimensional simulations, described\nin [2], we know that in (A), purely reaction diffusion waves without taxis terms (h\u2212 = h+ = 0) are possible, where as\nin (B), such waves are not possible.\nAll two dimensional simulations were performed in a rectangular domain (x, y) \u2208 [0, Lx ] \u00d7 [0, Ly ], with no-flux\nboundary conditions,\n\u2202(P, Z)\n\u2202x\n\n=\nx=0,Lx\n\n\u2202(P, Z)\n\u2202y\n\n= 0.\ny=0,Ly\n\nIn figures representing the results of the simulations, we designate the domain size as Lx \u00d7 Ly , choice of \u03b3, D combination as (A) or (B), the values of taxis coefficients as (h\u2212 , h+ ), and where the panels are presented with a regular\ntime interval, it is given as \u2206t.\nIII.\n\nPURSUIT-EVASION WAVES IN ONE DIMENSION\nA.\n\nMechanism of propagation\n\nIt is useful to first recapitulate the one-dimensional results, and we start with propagation of solitary waves.\nFigure 1 shows typical profiles of steadily propagating waves in a reaction-diffusion system and in a reaction-taxis\nsystem, and schematically illustrates various mechanism involved. In the reaction-diffusion wave (panel a), the density\nof predators changes only slightly through the front. The propagation of the wave front is mostly due to interaction\nbetween diffusion and nonlinear local dynamics of the prey: influx of prey due to the diffusion triggers the prey-escape\nmechanism, when the prey multiply faster than the predators and therefore grow unchecked until reaching the carrying\ncapacity of the habitat. Between the front and the back of the wave the prey and predators are in quasi-equilibrium,\nthe predators slowly consuming the prey and growing themselves. On the back, the concentration of the predators is\nso large that the high concentration of prey is no longer sustainable, and their dynamics are such that the transition\nto their low state is sudden, and is therefore also influenced by their diffusion, as at the front. The sequence of\nevents in the reaction-taxis wave is entirely different (panel b). The advancing front of prey attracts the predators\nin the retrograde direction. This leaves space relatively free of predators, which triggers the prey-escape mechanism.\nAnother mechanism, driving the prey forward, is evasion, i.e. their taxis away from the predators. This feedback loop\nof prey evading predators and predators pursuing prey leads to spatial oscillations of both (similar to the way the\nfeedback loop of prey benefiting predators and predators harming prey tends to produce their temporal oscillations).\nThe similarity with reaction-diffusion waves is that the front peaks when the prey reach their high quasi-equilibrium.\nThe difference, apart from oscillatory character of the taxis front, is that the density of predators does not remain\nnearly constant during the front, but instead shows a marked tip followed by a rise, due to predators first moving\nback towards advancing prey, and then stopping that movement when the gradient of prey is over. The events on the\nwaveback are also quite different. There we observe an advancing wave of predators pursuing prey, and the receding\nwave of prey escaping predators. This recession of prey is enhanced also by the fact that they are consumed by\npursuing predators. Thus the position of the back is not directly related to the time taken by predators to grow\nto a certain concentration or to consume a certain numbers of prey, but rather, by time and space needed for the\npursuit-evasion dynamics to form the back structure. As a result, the duration of the taxis wave is much shorter than\nthat of the diffusion wave.\nB.\n\nMechanism of reflection\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the process of reflection of the taxis wave from an impermeable boundary. When the front of\nthe wave arrives at the boundary, the system there switches to the high-prey state, close to the carrying capacity\n\n\f3\nof the habitat, i.e. the maximal stationary density of prey if predators are absent, which in our model is P = 1\n(t = t0 + 200). This is similar to what happens in a reaction-diffusion wave, and in both cases is mainly due to the\nnonlinear dynamics of the prey population. The difference comes when the back of the excitation wave approaches the\nboundary (t = t0 + 200 . . . t0 + 400), because in the taxis wave, unlike the diffusion wave, the back of the wave profile\nis formed by prey evading the peak of predators following them, rather than by consumption of prey by predators.\nAs a result, in the taxis wave, the density of predators at the back of the wave is insufficient to reduce prey density to\na low level during the time that the tail actually lasts. Thus, when the evading prey are stopped by the impermeable\nboundary, the predators catching up with them do not consume them all. Instead, a substantial density of prey\nsurvives (t = t0 + 400). Those prey that survive after the maximum of the predator density has passed them escape\nin the retrograde direction (t = t0 + 600), and if their number is large enough, initiate a new backward propagating\nwave (t = t0 + 800).\nThus we see that the mechanism of reflection of taxis waves is entirely different from known mechanisms of reflection\nof reaction-diffusion waves, e.g. positive overlap of oscillatory tails of the colliding waves discussed in [4], which required\na very close proximity of the local dynamics to the Hopf bifurcation. In that case the reflection property was restricted\nto a narrow region in the parameter space. With the present mechanism the reflection is rather robust, both in terms\nof local dynamics, and of taxis and diffusion coefficients [2].\nIV.\n\nSPIRAL WAVES\n\nAmongst the most ubiquitous, dramatic and intensively studied phenomena observed in 2D reaction-diffusion excitable systems are re-entrant excitation waves, commonly known as spiral waves [5]. They are observed in a variety\nof experimental systems, and in an even greater variety of mathematical models, that includes spatially extended\nmathematical models of predator-prey interaction of the reaction-diffusion type [6]. Their significance stems from the\nfact that they can occur in an event of a wave break in a propagating excitation for whatever reason, and thus serve\nas a specific route spatio-temporal chaos. Thus, we have started to study details of reaction-diffusion-taxis waves in\n2D through the effect that the taxis terms have on the spiral waves.\nA.\n\nVery small taxis can destabilize spirals\n\nFigure 3 shows a typical rigidly rotating spiral wave solution, observed in the purely reaction-diffusion model. From\nthe behaviour of 1D solutions[2, 2], qualitatively new behaviour in 2D based on 1D phenomenology (e.g. reflection\nfrom the boundaries) is expected when the taxis terms are large enough in comparison with coefficient D (= 0.04\nin our simulations). The relevant values are of the order of 1, which corresponds to comparable fluxes generated by\nthe diffusion and the taxis terms, at the values of the variables at around the stable equilibrium. Comparison of\nfluxes gives a reasonable way to compare the relative significance of taxis and diffusion terms, as h\u00b1 are coefficients\nof nonlinear terms and have different dimensionality from that of D.\nFigure 4 shows the behaviour of the reaction-diffusion-taxis spiral wave at values of the taxis coefficients much\nsmaller than those at which reflection happens. Already these small taxis terms change the behaviour of the spiral\nvery significantly, as, with the same local kinetics as the stationary spiral of fig. 3, it now meanders wildly. This kind\nof non-stationary behaviour of spiral waves is not unknown in excitable media, where the transition from steady to\nmeandering rotation is usually associated with change of the parameters of the reaction; here we see such a transition\nfor the same reaction parameters but with the spatial terms altered.\nAs the taxis coefficients increase, their effect on the spiral wave dynamics increases further. Figure 5 shows that\nthe spiral wave meander becomes so extended that the spiral soon drifts out of the medium and annihilates at the\nboundary. This happens at taxis coefficients that are still much smaller than those needed for quasi-soliton behaviour.\nB.\n\nPeculiar behaviour of the tip: waltzing spiral\n\nAs the 1D studies have shown, if taxis terms are present, waves can propagate without any diffusion. Figure 6 shows\na strikingly different behaviour of a spiral wave in such a system in 2D. Apparently, the tip of the spiral periodically\nswitches between two meta-stable states, in one of which it curls up as in a typical spiral wave in a strongly excitable\nreaction-diffusion system, and in the other it propagates along a straight line orthogonally to the front of the wave,\nas happens in an excitable system on the verge of excitability. This results in a \"slow waltz\" trajectory, when the\nspiral makes 5/4 of a turn, then moves along a straight line, then makes another 5/4 of a turn, and so on. In total,\nthe spiral makes exactly five turns per each round of, and in the same direction as the meander trajectory.\n\n\f4\nThe ratio 1 : 5 is not unique, as spiral waves in reaction diffusion systems can demonstrate a continuous spectrum\nof these ratios as kinetic parameters change [7, 8]. It fits well with theoretical considerations based on symmetry\nconsiderations [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], except that an exact four-fold symmetry should, from the viewpoint of that theory,\nbe non-typical. Apparently in our case its appearance should be attributed to a resonance with the slight anisotropy of\nthe numerical discretization. The mechanism of the meander appears more exotic, in which the tip trajectory consists\nof alternating pieces of very small and large curvature, where the high-curvature pieces form more than one full turn\nof the spiral wave. As far as we are aware this kind of spiral wave meander has not been seen in reaction-diffusion\nsystems.\nV.\n\nALTERNATIVE BEHAVIOUR OF THE WAVE TIPS\n\nIn reaction-diffusion excitable systems, if an excitation wave is broken, its tip will either grow (\"germinate\"),\nprotrude and curl up into a spiral wave, if the medium is \"strongly excitable\", or it may shrink and retract, if it is\n\"weakly excitable\". Figure 7 shows an example of a reaction-taxis excitable system, where neither takes place. The\ntip of a broken wave protrudes, but does not curl up into a spiral; instead new characteristic phenomena are observed.\nA.\n\nWavetip swelling\n\nSee fig. 7, t = 40 . . . 60. The consequence of the wavebreak protruding may be seen as \"swelling\" of the tip, as it\ngoes through a \"blobbing\" stage, when an initially small oval-shape region of medium is excited, which subsequently\ngrows and reforms into circular expanding wave stage. A phenomenological interpretation of this swelling phenomenon\nfollows from the empirical observation that it usually happens when the evasion coefficient is large compared to the\npursuit coefficient. Thus the prey near the wavebreak have the capacity to escape from the predators sideways. A\nsubpopulation of prey then finds itself in a region relatively free from predators. In this predator-free zone prey start\nmultiplying intensively and form a circular expanding region. As there is no chasing wave of predators inside this\ncircular region, the high-prey state ends only when the predators multiply to large densities, taking much longer than\nin a standard reaction-taxis propagating wave where the end of the prey wave is determined by the chasing wave of\npredators. So the swollen tip can grow to form a large patch of prey, before turning into an annular shape wave, when\nthe back-structure of the taxis wave is formed. Subsequently, the predator wave catches up with the prey and the\ncircular expanding region develops into a annulus-shaped expanding wave.\nB.\n\nSelf-attachment\n\nSee fig. 7, t = 60 . . . 240. After the tip swelling phase, no wavebreak can be identified based on the distribution of\nthe prey population. Nevertheless, a wavebreak, or tip, can be formally defined, e.g. as an intersection of suitable\nisolines of the prey and predator populations, as illustrated on fig. 8. For topological reasons, such a tip cannot\ndisappear, but has to move continuously until reaching the medium boundary or annihilating with another tip of the\nopposite chirality. Such a \"tip\" is found near where the circular wave, newly born from the swollen tip, touches the\nback of the mother wave. Now the whole old+new wave can be seen as a single wave, a free end of which is attached\nsomewhere to its own back. This could not happen in a reaction-diffusion medium, because of the refractory period\nbehind an excitation wave. In terms of the present population dynamics system, the refractory period is characterised\nby such high density of predators that triggering a prey-escape mechanism is not feasible. The difference with taxis\nexcitation waves is that they are not characterised by significant difference in the predators' density before and after\nthe wave. To put it briefly, the prey wave finishes not just when all prey are consumed by predators, but rather when\nthose that are not consumed have escaped forward. Similarly, the predators' wave finishes not when all predators\ndie out because of starvation, but rather when all predators have moved forward in the pursuit of prey. Thus the\nequilibrium concentration of predators and prey behind the wave establishes rather quickly and due to a mechanism\nquite different from reaction-diffusion waves. As a result, there is little or no \"refractory tail\" behind a taxis wave,\nand this makes the self-attachment of a wave's tip to its own back possible.\nThe structure of the attachment site is illustrated in more detail on fig. 8. The high prey regions of the mother wave\nand the circular wave are connected, whereas their high predator regions are disjoint, or, more precisely, connected\nby an isthmus of much smaller concentration of predators than elsewhere, because the predators at the junction have\nbeen attracted backwards by the circular wave. Note that the attached wave tip has to move considerably faster than\na plane solitary wave, as it participates simultaneously in the movement of the mother wave, and the circular wave,\nwhich moves at an angle to the mother wave. One more reason for such faster movement is the unusual nonlinear\n\n\f5\ndispersion relationship for taxis waves, where speed increases as period decreses. This property is illustrated on fig. 9,\nwhich shows velocity of waves propagating on a one-dimensional interval with periodic boundary conditions. Initially\na wave was started on an interval of a large length L. This length then was decreased in small steps, after each of\nwhich sufficient time was allowed for the circulating wave to approach its stationary velocity v(L), which was then\nrecorded, and the next decrease of L was made. To circumvent the interpretation difficulty related to the difference\nof spatial scales in diffusion and taxis terms, we plot not the absolute velocity, but the velocity relative to the velocity\nof a solitary wave, v(\u221e). For the same reason, the horizontal coordinate on fig. 9 is not the spatial period of waves\nL, but their temporal period T calculated as L/v(L).\nAnother way to view the mechanism of the attachment of the free end is through kinetics of the prey, which multiply\nmore efficiently because of the gap in the predators' population at the site of the junction; the wave grows in the gap\nrather than propagates into it (in fact, of course, prey growth is an essential component of the wave propagation, so\nboth explanations are valid).\nVI.\n\nPARTIAL REFLECTION\n\nAs we have already mentioned, at appropriate taxis coefficients, one-dimensional waves can reflect from the boundaries and penetrate through each other. In two dimensions, there are new aspects characterising impact of the waves\nwith boundaries and each other, not available in one dimension: the curvature of the waves at the moment of impact,\nand angle of incidence. In reaction-diffusion systems, the the wave propagation velocity is known to depend on the\ncurvature of the wave. We have found that in our reaction-taxis model, the curvature, or angle of incidence, or both,\naffect the result of the impact, i.e. whether the wave will be reflected from the medium boundary or another wave, or\nwill annihilate at it. A representative example is shown on fig. 10. A circular wave was initiated at an asymmetrically\nlocated site within a rectangular region, so its distances to all four boundaries were different. The result is that the\nwave has mostly annihilated at the northern and western boundaries (except small parts of the wave at the further\nends of those boundaries), which the wave reached first while having a higher curvature. Then the wave has mostly\nreflected from the southern and eastern boundaries, which it reached later while having a lower curvature. The waves\nreflected from the eastern and southern boundaries partly annihilate on impact, namely, where their collision is more\nhead-on. Meanwhile, where their collision is more slantwise, the waves penetrate each other. One more factor that\ncan affect the outcome of the collision, is the \"age\" of the propagating wave. This is related to delicate asymptotic\nproperties of the taxis waves which will be considered in more detail elsewhere[14]. For the present paper, the important observation is that a colliding wave may either annihilate or penetrate/reflect in the same medium, depending\non the local details of the collision. Therefore, the outcome of collision may be different for different parts of the same\ncolliding wave, which means that the wave will be broken.\nVII.\n\nSELF-SUPPORTING ACTIVITY\n\nWe have identified two specifically two-dimensional phenomena that can happen to pursuit-evasion waves: partial\nreflection/penetration, and tip swelling. These two phenomena can work together to generate a self-supporting spatiotemporal activity. The typical sequence of events is: partially reflected/penetrated waves are broken, i.e. have free\nends. Unlike waves in reaction-diffusion systems, these free ends do not curl up into spirals, but swell and produce\ncircular waves with the free end eventually attached to the back of its mother wave. These waves interact with each\nother and with medium boundaries, where some of them are partially penetrated/reflected, i.e. broken, which leads\nto new swollen tips, and so this sequence of events repeats. We have, as a result, a spatio-temporal \"chaos\". The\nmechanism described is different from that known before in reaction-diffusion excitable systems, or indeed in any other\nnonlinear spatially distributed systems. Examples of such self-supporting activities at different values of parameters\nare shown on the series of figures, 11\u201315. We present a broad collection of simulations, to show that this mechanism\nis not restricted to a narrow region of parameters but is rather typical. In figs. 11, 14 and 15 initial conditions were in\nthe form of a single spot that produced initially a circular wave, while in figs. 12 and 13 initial conditions were in the\nform of an artificially broken plane wave, which in a reaction-diffusion system would generate a spiral wave. Figure 14\nis for kinetics A, which supports waves, particularly spiral waves in a reaction-diffusion system without taxis, whereas\nthe rest of this set are for kinetics B, with various combinations of taxis coefficients, which does not support either\nspiral or any other type of waves without taxis. Kinetics A of fig. 14 shows strong waves, with relatively thick stripes\nof prey and very large swollen tips, whereas kinetics B in fig. 15 produces relatively thin waves with rather modest\nswollen tip (their traces can be noticed e.g. at the t = 620 panel). The self-supporting activity can last long, but not\nnecessarily for ever, as there is always a possibility that all waves will annihilate on collisions so that activity survives,\nas happens in fig. 15. Obviously the probability of that is higher in a smaller system. For instance, in fig. 15, the\n\n\f6\nsquare symmetry of the problem means that the effective size of the system is eight time smaller than the area of the\nsquare.\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have demonstrated that two-dimensional excitable reaction-diffusion-taxis systems can exhibit new properties,\nunavailable in one-dimensional systems of the same kind, and different from two-dimensional purely reaction-diffusion\nsystems with the same kinetics. Even relatively small taxis terms can make spiral waves very unstable in conditions\nwhere they would be stable without such terms. If the taxis (pursuit/evasion) terms are large enough, compared to\ndiffusion, to cause quasi-soliton behaviour in 1D, then the 2D behaviour is entirely different and is no longer dominated\nby processes of spiral waves generation and births, as is typical for reaction-diffusion systems. Instead, a new type of\nself-supporting activity takes place, which is mediated by three qualitatively new types of events,\n\u2022 Partial reflection of waves from boundaries, or their partial penetration through each other, which produces\nbroken waves, and\n\u2022 \"Swollen tips\", i.e. circular wave sources, produced by free ends of broken waves.\n\u2022 Attachment of free ends of broken waves to the wavebacks.\nThe first of these phenomena is due to sensitive dependence of quasi-soliton behaviour on the circumstances of collision.\nThe second is due to the increased possibility of the sideward escape of prey from the head of the propagating taxis\nwave near the wave break, when their mobility is higher than that of the predators. The third is due to short supply\nof predators at the site of attachment, which allows prey to multiply quicker to seal the gap. All three phenomena\nare related to the peculiar feature of the reaction-taxis waves, the virtual absence of the refractory tail, which is a\nprominent feature of reaction-diffusion excitation waves.\nThe value of this study is twofold. First, this illustrates the importance of taking into account of directed movement of species in modelling spatially distributed interacting populations, as this can produce completely different\nphenomena from those that occur in reaction-diffusion systems. Second, this is interesting in a broader nonlinear\nscience context, as an example of a new type of nonlinear dissipative waves, with some properties similar to those\nknown before, and some completely new.\nAs we noted earlier, quasi-soliton behaviour can be observed in some reaction-diffusion excitable systems if its\nkinetics are close to a Hopf bifurcation[4]. In two spatial dimensions, such systems also demonstrate unusual types of\nbehaviour, such as converging, concave spirals [15, 16, 17], but again in very limited regions of parameter space.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported in part by EPSRC grant GR/S08664/01 (UK) and RFBR grant 03-01-00673 (Russia).\n\n[1] M.A. Tsyganov, J.
