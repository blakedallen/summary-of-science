Free neutrons are released by\nthe reaction 13 C(\u03b1,n)16 O - or 22 Ne(\u03b1,n)25 Mg in more\nmassive AGB stars (> 3.5 M\u2299 ) - in the intershell region between the H- and He-burning shells. Fe-peak\nnuclei experience a series of n-captures interspersed\nwith \u03b2-decays to transform into isotopes of heavier elements. The enriched material is transported to the\n\nNebular spectroscopy uniquely reveals information\nabout n-capture nucleosynthesis that cannot be obtained from stellar spectra. For example, the lightest n-capture elements (Z = 30\u201336) and noble gases\nare not well-studied in their sites of synthesis, due\nto the difficulty in detecting these species in evolved\nstars or supernova remnants (e.g., Wallerstein et al.\n1995). In contrast, these elements are readily detected\nin PNe. Spectroscopy of PNe also enables investigations of s-process nucleosynthesis in intermediate-mass\nstars (M = 3.5\u20138 M\u2299 ). These stars are obscured\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nby dusty, optically thick circumstellar envelopes during the AGB and post-AGB phases (Habing 1996;\nVan Winckel 2003) that preclude optical or UV spectroscopy. Hence, little is known about their contribution to s-process nuclei in the Universe (Travaglio et al.\n2004). These stars produce Type I PNe (characterized\nby He and N enrichments; Peimbert 1978) in which\nn-capture elements can be detected.\nThe low cosmic abundances of n-capture elements\n(Asplund et al. 2005) prevented their identification in\nnebular spectra until P\u00e9quignot & Baluteau (1994, hereafter PB94) discovered emission lines of Se, Br, Kr, Xe,\nand possibly other trans-iron elements in the optical\nspectrum of the PN NGC 7027. Many of these identifications were later confirmed with higher resolution\nspectroscopy performed by Zhang et al. (2005) and\nSharpee et al. (2007). PB94's analysis led Dinerstein\n(2001) to identify two anonymous emission lines in the\nK band spectra of PNe as fine-structure transitions of\n[Se IV] and [Kr III]. Shortly thereafter, Sterling et al.\n(2002) identified Ge III \u03bb1088.46 in absorption in the\nUV spectra of four PNe, and found that these objects\nexhibit Ge enrichments indicative of s-process nucleosynthesis in their progenitor stars. Together, these\nstudies determined abundances of n-capture elements\nin only 11 PNe, too small a sample to characterize\ns-process enrichments in PNe as a population.\nSterling & Dinerstein (2008, hereafter SD08) performed the first large-scale survey of n-capture elements in PNe by detecting the near-infrared emission\nlines [Kr III] 2.199 and/or [Se IV] 2.287 \u03bcm in 81\nof 120 Galactic PNe. To correct for the abundances\nof unobserved Se and Kr ions, analytical ionization\ncorrection factors (ICFs) were derived from a large\ngrid of photoionization models (Sterling et al. 2007).\nWe derived Se and Kr abundances (or upper limits)\nin each object, increasing the number of PNe with\nknown n-capture element abundances by nearly an order of magnitude. Se and Kr were found to be enriched by a factor of two or more in \u223c45% of the observed PNe, indicating efficient s-process nucleosynthesis and convective dredge-up in their progenitor\nstars. Both exhibit a positive correlation with the\nC/O ratio, as has been found for other n-capture elements in AGB (Smith & Lambert 1990) and postAGB stars (Van Winckel 2003). Type I PNe, which\nhave intermediate-mass progenitors, display little or no\nenrichment of Se and Kr compared to other PN subclasses. These trends have been shown to be consistent\nwith theoretical predictions (Karakas et al. 2009).\nThe K band Se and Kr lines were recently detected\nin three nearby extragalactic PNe by Dinerstein et al.\n(2009), providing insight to the nucleosynthesis of these\nelements in low-metallicity environments for the first\ntime. The PN Hen 2-436 in the Sagittarius dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy exhibits large enrichments of Se and\nKr (Figure 1), comparable to the most highly enriched\nGalactic PNe observed by SD08, while two PNe observed in the Magellanic Clouds do not appear to be\nenriched.\nThe Se and Kr abundances derived in these studies are typically accurate to within a factor of two or\nthree, based on the error analyses of Sterling et al.\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nFigure 1: K band spectrum of the PN Hen 2-436 in\nthe Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, measured\nwith the GNIRS spectrograph on Gemini South\n(from Dinerstein et al. 2009). Both [Kr III] 2.199\nand [Se IV] 2.287 \u03bcm were detected, and are identified in the figure.\n\n(2007) and SD08, and similar uncertainties can be expected for other n-capture elements observed in ionized nebulae. These uncertainties stem from (1) the\ndetection of only one ion each of Se and Kr, which\ncan lead to large and uncertain ICFs; and (2) the\npoorly known atomic data that controls the ionization balance of these elements, which precludes the\nderivation of accurate ICFs. We present initial results\nfrom a multi-disciplinary investigation, comprised of\nnew optical observations and atomic data determinations, designed to address these sources of uncertainty\nand enable much more accurate abundance analyses of\nn-capture elements in ionized nebulae.\n\n2\n\nOptical Observations\n\nOptical spectroscopy provides access to transitions from\nseveral ions of Br, Kr, Rb, Xe, and (when combined\nwith near-infrared data) Se. Detecting multiple ions of\nthese elements reduces the magnitude and importance\nof uncertainties in their ICFs, and hence in the derived\nelemental abundances. Moreover, Xe is a \"heavy-s\"\nelement that lies near the s-process peak at Ba. The\nabundance of Xe relative to those of lighter n-capture\nelements can be used to determine the neutron exposure (i.e., the time-averaged neutron flux) experienced by Fe-peak nuclei during s-process nucleosynthesis. At a given metallicity, the neutron exposure controls the element-by-element distribution of s-process\nenrichments (Busso et al. 1999, 2001).\nThe robust identification of optical n-capture element lines in nebular spectra requires high spectral\nresolution in order to distinguish them from nearby\ntransitions of more abundant elements and/or telluric\nfeatures. We are conducting optical observations of sprocess enriched Galactic PNe selected from the nearinfrared sample of SD08, using the 2D Coud\u00e9 cross-\n\n\fwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\n3\n\nFigure 2: Selected Kr and Xe emission lines detected in the PN J 900 (top panels), and Br and Rb lines\nin NGC 6644 (lower left panels) and NGC 3242 (lower right panels). Telluric emission lines have not\nbeen removed, and appear as narrow features within some of the panels. Note that wavelengths are not\ncorrected for systemic nebular velocities.\n\ndispersed echelle spectrometer (Tull et al. 1995) on\nthe 2.7-m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald\nObservatory. Using two grating tilt settings and a\n1.8\"-wide slit, this instrument provides nearly complete spectral coverage in the wavelength range 3 700\u2013\n10 400 \u00c5, at a resolution R = 36 700 (sufficiently large\nto resolve many n-capture element lines from potential\nblends).\nTo date, we have completed optical observations\nof approximately 17 PNe. These objects display rich\nspectra, with \u223c100 emission lines in the sparsest spectrum to over 400 lines in NGC 3242. Kr emission has\nbeen detected in all but one of these objects, and several exhibit lines from multiple Kr ions. At least one\nXe emission line has been detected in about half of\nthese PNe, and Se, Br, and Rb lines have been tentatively identified in 3-4 objects each. Figure 2 displays\nselected Kr, Xe, Br, and Rb emission lines in targets\nfrom our sample.\n\n3\n\nAtomic Data Calculations\n\nAbundance determinations of n-capture elements in\nionized nebulae are affected by uncertainties in the\natomic data governing the ionization balance of these\nspecies - in particular, photoionization (PI) crosssections and rate coefficients for radiative recombination (RR), dielectronic recombination (DR), and charge\n\ntransfer (CT). These data are needed to derive accurate ICFs to correct for the abundances of unobserved ions. Atomic data uncertainties can lead to\nSe and Kr abundance uncertainties of a factor of two\n(Sterling et al. 2007), and similar uncertainties can be\nexpected for other n-capture elements.\nWith the atomic structure code AUTOSTRUCTURE (Badnell 1986), we are computing PI crosssections and RR and DR rate coefficients for the first\nfive ions of Se, Kr, and Xe, the three most widely detected n-capture elements in PNe (P\u00e9quignot & Baluteau\n1994; Sharpee et al. 2007, SD08). This code can be\nused to efficiently compute multi-configuration distorted\nwave PI cross-sections and radiative and autoionization rates. Relativistic effects are accounted for via\nthe Breit-Pauli formalism and semi-relativistic radial\nfunctions.\nWe are computing the electronic structure of each\nion using multiple configurations within the intermediate coupling scheme. These configuration expansions\nare utilized to compute PI cross-sections out of the\nvalence shells, which are resolved in both initial and\nfinal state and can be combined to determine the total cross-section of each ion. In Figure 3, we show\nthe computed Xe3+ PI cross-section near the ground\nstate threshold region, plotted against the experimental measurements of Bizau et al. (2006). RR is related\nto the non-resonant portion of the PI cross-sections,\nand can be computed from the principal of detailed\n\n\f4\n\nPublications of the Astronomical Society of Australia\n\nSe\n2\n\n2\n\n4\n\nD\n\nP\n\n20\n\nS\n\n1\n\nD\n\nCross section (Mb)\n\n+\n\n1\n\nS\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n1\n\n1\n\nD\n\n0\n\nFigure 3: The calculated Xe3+ PI cross-section\n(solid line), using a 5 configuration expansion for\nXe3+ and 6 configurations for Xe4+ .

However, these\nuncertainties can be alleviated with our experimental\nPI cross-section measurements (\u00a74).\nFor each of these processes, we are estimating the\nuncertainties in our computations in order to evaluate\ntheir effect on elemental abundance derivations (\u00a75).\nFor example, uncertainties in the PI cross-sections and\nRR rate coefficients can be estimated by altering the\nconfiguration expansions utilized for the initial and\ntarget ions. DR uncertainties are estimated by shifting\nthe continuum level relative to the near-threshold energy levels, thereby varying the energies and number\nof autoionizing channels available for DR.\n\n4\n\nExperimental Photoionization\nCross-Section Measurements\n\nTo benchmark our atomic data calculations, we are\nperforming experimental absolute PI cross-section measurements of Se, Kr, and Xe ions. These data constrain both our PI and DR calculations, since PI resonances near the ionization threshold correspond to\nlow-temperature DR resonances. Measuring the energies of these resonances allows us to normalize the\nunknown energies of autoionization resonances in our\nDR calculations.\nThese measurements are being conducted at the\nAdvanced Light Source (ALS) synchrotron radiation\nfacility at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, with the ion-photon merged beams endstation on\nBeamline 10.0.1.2 (Covington et al. 2002; Aguilar et al.\n2003). In these measurements, a beam of atomic ions\n\nCross section (Mb)\n\nn=6\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n1\n\nS\n\nn=4\n\n0\n18\n\n1\n\nD\n\nn=7\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\nFigure 4: Top panel: The Se+ photoionization\ncross-section measured at the ALS (Sterling et al.\n2009).

EUV and soft X-ray photons are produced\nby electrons accelerated to 1.9 GeV that pass through\nan undulator located in a straight section of the storage\nring lattice. At the beamline, the photon beam energy\nand resolution are controlled by a spherical-grating\nmonochromator with three interchangeable gratings and\nadjustable slits. Atomic ions are produced in an electroncyclotron resonance source, and accelerated by a potential (typically 6 keV). The desired charge state is\nselected with an analyzing magnet, and the ion beam\nis merged with the counter-propagating photon beam.\nPhotoions are produced along the merged beam path,\n\n\f5\n\nwww.publish.csiro.au/journals/pasa\n\n(Norrington & Grant 1987; Wijesundera et al. 1991)\nin order to identify resonance features and to disentangle the contributions of the ground and metastable\nstates (e.g., Figure 6). A parallel version of the DARC\nsuite of codes has been developed by Ballance & Griffin\n(2006), and was recently modified to efficiently compute numerous bound-free dipole matrix elements, distributed over an equivalent number of processors to\nenable photoionization calculations to be carried out\nat a high degree of accuracy (Ballance et al. 2008).\n\n8\n7\n\n3+\n\nSe\n\n4+\n\n+ hv ---> Se\n\n-\n\n+ e\n\nCross section (Mb)\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n0\n42\n\n44\n\n46\n\n48\n\n50\n\n52\n\n54\n\n56\n\nPhoton energy (eV)\n\nFigure 5: The Se3+ photoionization cross-section\nmeasured at the ALS. Circles with error bars represent absolute measurements performed at discrete photon energies.\n\nand are directed to a detector by a demerging magnet.\nThis apparatus has two operational modes: spectroscopy and absolute mode. For spectroscopy, photoion yields produced along the entire merged path\nare recorded in arbitrary units as a function of photon energy. To place these yields in physical units\n(absolute mode), a potential is placed on a cylindrical \"interaction region,\" which has a precisely defined\nlength. This potential energy-tags all photoions produced within the interaction region, and the demerging magnet setting is altered so that only the energytagged ions are detected. By determining the overlap\nof the photon and ion beams in the interaction region,\nabsolute PI cross-sections can be measured at discrete\nenergies. These measurements are used to normalize\nthe photoion yields onto an absolute scale.\nWe have measured absolute PI cross-sections near\nthe ionization thresholds of Se+ (Sterling et al. 2009,\nFigure 4), Se2+ , Se3+ (Figure 5), Xe2+ , and the photoion yield of Xe+ . PI cross-sections of Kr ions have already been measured (Lu et al. 2006a,b; Lu 2006), as\nhave those of more highly charged Xe ions (Bizau et al.\n2006). Unfortunately, the Se4+ PI cross-section cannot be measured with this apparatus due to an Auger\nresonance effect (also seen in the isoelectronic Kr6+ ).\nThe analysis of these measurements is complicated\nby the presence of meta-stable states in the primary\nion beam, which may contribute to the measured crosssections along with ground state ions. It is necessary to measure the PI cross-sections at energies below\nthe ground state threshold (i.e., down to those of the\nmetastable states) in order to estimate the fractional\ncontent of these states in the ion beam.\nThe measured cross-sections are interpreted with\nthe aid of the fully relativistic R-matrix code DARC1\n1 http://www.am.qub.ac.uk/DARC\n\nImplementation\n\nThe new atomic data will be incorporated into the\natomic database of the photoionization code Cloudy\n(Ferland et al. 1998). Following the methodology of\nSterling et al. (2007), we will compute a grid of models to determine analytical ICFs for Se, Kr, and Xe.\nIn addition, we will use Cloudy to test the effects that\nour estimated atomic data uncertainties have on the\nderived elemental abundances. This quantitative analysis will clarify the ionic systems and atomic processes\nthat require further attention in future investigations.\nThe ICFs will be applied to our optical (\u00a72) and nearinfrared spectra (SD08) to derive accurate n-capture\nelement abundances in PNe, in order to study the details of s-process nucleosynthesis and convective mixing in PN progenitor stars. Combined, our optical observations and atomic data determinations will allow\nus to determine n-capture element abundances and sprocess enrichment factors in ionized nebulae with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe gratefully acknowledge J.
