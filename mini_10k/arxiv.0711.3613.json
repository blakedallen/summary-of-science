Astrophysical applications probe the equation\nof state at the extremes of isospin and temperature: The mass of a neutron\nstar depends mainly on the equation of state of neutron matter up to densities\n\u03c1 \u223c 4\u03c10 [5], where \u03c10 = 0.16 fm\u22123 is the saturation density of symmetric\nnuclear matter, while supernova explosions are most sensitive to the properties\nof nucleonic matter at subnuclear densities and MeV temperatures [3]. For\nmany regimes of interest, the equation of state has to be extrapolated from\nthe conditions reached with existing and upcoming experimental facilities.\nTherefore, reliable theoretical input is needed. In this paper, we present a\nstudy of neutron matter at finite temperature, as part of a program to improve\nthe nuclear equation of state input for astrophysics.\nEmail addresses: tolos@fias.uni-frankfurt.de (L.

First, there is a strong short-range repulsion, which\nleads to bound states of the \"flipped\" potential \u03bbVNN for small, negative \u03bb.\nThis implies that \u03bb = 1 is far outside the radius of convergence. Consequently,\nat least the summation of particle-particle ladder diagrams is required [6]. Second, the tensor force, which is singular at short distances, requires iteration in\nthe triplet channels [7,8]. Finally, there are physical bound and nearly-bound\nstates in the S-waves, which render the perturbative Born series divergent. Recently, it was shown that the first two sources of nonperturbative behavior depend on the choice of NN interaction, and can be removed by evolving nuclear\nforces to low-momentum interactions Vlow k [9,10,11,12] with cutoffs around\n2 fm\u22121 [13,14]. An important additional advantage is that the corresponding\nleading-order three-nucleon (3N) interactions from chiral effective field theory\n(EFT) become perturbative in light nuclei for cutoffs \u039b . 2 fm\u22121 [15].\nAt sufficient density (\u03c1 & 0.01\u03c10 [16] in nuclear matter), Pauli blocking eliminates the shallow bound states, and thus the particle-particle channel becomes perturbative [13]. Consequently, the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation\nis a good starting point for low-momentum NN and 3N interactions, and perturbation theory (in the sense of a loop expansion) around the HF energy\nbecomes tractable. The perturbative character is due to a combination of\nPauli blocking and an appreciable effective range (see also Ref. [17]). The 3N\ninteraction is essential for nuclear matter saturation [13], while the contributions to the potential energy remain compatible with EFT power-counting\nestimates. Furthermore, the equation of state becomes significantly less cutoff dependent with the inclusion of the dominant second-order contributions.\nIn this paper, we extend the investigation of Ref. [13] to neutron matter at\nsubsaturation densities, \u03c1 < \u03c10 , and generalize the perturbative approach to\nfinite temperature.\nBased on the work of Kohn, Luttinger and Ward [18,19], at finite temperature\nthe loop expansion around the HF free energy can be realized by the perturbative expansion of the free energy. In this paper, we include the first-order\nNN and 3N contributions, as well as anomalous and normal second-order diagrams with NN interactions. We defer 3N contributions beyond the HF level\nand higher-order corrections to future work. The pressure, entropy and energy\nare calculated using standard thermodynamic relations. Since low-momentum\ninteractions are energy independent, the Matsubara sums can be carried out\nanalytically.\nLow-momentum interactions Vlow k and the corresponding 3N forces are defined\nby sharp or smooth regulators with a variable momentum cutoff \u039b. Varying\nthe cutoff is a powerful tool to estimate the theoretical errors due to neglected\nhigher-order many-body interactions and to assess the completeness of the\ncalculations. We use the cutoff dependence to provide simple error estimates,\n2\n\n\fand find that the cutoff dependence is reduced significantly, when second-order\ncontributions are included. The possibility of estimating theoretical errors is\nan important step towards reliable extrapolations to astrophysical conditions.\nFinally, we compare our results to the virial equation of state [20,21] and to\nvariational calculations [22]. The low-density behavior is in good agreement\nwith the virial equation of state. Our results for the energy per particle (see\nFig. 5) highlight the importance of a correct finite-temperature treatment of\nsecond and higher-order correlations.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the perturbative\nexpansion at finite temperature and give the expressions for the evaluated\ndiagrams. Our results for the free energy, pressure, entropy and energy are\npresented in Sect. 3. We conclude and give an outlook in Sect. 4.\n\n2\n\nLoop expansion at finite temperature\n\nWe consider the perturbative expansion of the grand-canonical potential,\n\u03a9(\u03bc, T, V ) = \u2212\u03b2 ln Z(\u03bc, T, V ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Z(\u03bc, T, V ) denotes the partition function of the interacting Fermi system, \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03b2 = 1/T the inverse temperature and V\nthe volume. We include the first-order NN and 3N contributions, \u03a91,NN and\n\u03a91,3N , as well as the second-order anomalous and normal contributions with\nNN interactions, \u03a92,a and \u03a92,n . The grand-canonical potential is then given by\n\u03a9 = \u03a90 + \u03a91 + \u03a92 + . . .\n= \u03a90 + (\u03a91,NN + \u03a91,3N ) + (\u03a92,a + \u03a92,n ) + . . . ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere terms of the same order are enclosed in brackets, and \u03a90 is the grandcanonical potential of the non-interacting system,\nZ\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03a90\ndk k 2\ndk\n\u2212\u03b2(\u01ebk \u2212\u03bc)\n=\n\u22122\n= \u22122 T\nln\n1\n+\ne\nnk .\nV\n(2\u03c0)3\n(2\u03c0)3 3m\n\n(3)\n\nHere, \u01ebk = k 2 /(2m) is the free single-particle energy, with m the nucleon mass,\nand nk = 1/[e\u03b2(\u01ebk \u2212\u03bc) +1] is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function. The different\ncontributions are depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 1.\nThe loop expansion around the HF energy is realized by the perturbative\nexpansion of the free energy F (N, T, V ), which is obtained by a Legendre\ntransformation of the grand-canonical potential with respect to the chemical\npotential,\nF (N, T, V ) = \u03a9(\u03bc, T, V ) + \u03bc N .\n(4)\n3\n\n\fk2\nk1\n\nk\n(0)\n\nk2\n\nk3\n\nk1\n\nk2\n\nk3\n\nk3 k4\n\nk2\n\nk1\n\n(1, 3N)\n\n(1, NN)\n\nk1\n\n(2, a)\n\n(2, n)\n\nFig. 1.

The wiggly and double-wiggly lines denote antisymmetrized low-momentum NN and 3N interactions, respectively.\n\nThe mean particle number N \u2261 hNi is given by\nN(\u03bc, T, V ) = \u2212\n\n\u2202\u03a9\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n=\u2212\nT,V\n\n\u2202\u03a90\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n\u2212\nT,V\n\n\u2202\u03a91\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n\u2212\nT,V\n\n\u2202\u03a92\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n\u2212 ... .\n\n(5)\n\nT,V\n\nIn order to invert Eq. (5) for the chemical potential \u03bc(N, T, V ), we follow the\ntreatment of Kohn and Luttinger [18] and expand \u03bc to the same order\n\u03bc = \u03bc0 + \u03bc1 + \u03bc2 + . . . ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the particle number is counted as order zero. The lowest order term \u03bc0\nis the chemical potential of a non-interacting system with the same density\n\u03c1 = N/V as the interacting system.\nExpanding each term on the right-hand side of Eq. (5) around \u03bc = \u03bc0 and\nsolving for the chemical potential order by order leads to\nN =\u2212\n\n\u2202\u03a90\n\u2202\u03bc\n\nand \u03bc1 = \u2212\n\u03bc0\n\n\u2202\u03a91 /\u2202\u03bc\n\u2202 2 \u03a90 /\u2202\u03bc2\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\n\u03bc0\n\nand correspondingly for the free energy\nF = \u03a90 (\u03bc0 ) + (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 )\n\n\u2202\u03a90\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n+\n\u03bc0\n\n1 2 \u2202 2 \u03a90\n\u03bc\n2 1 \u2202\u03bc2\n\n+ \u03a91 (\u03bc0 ) + \u03bc1\n\u03bc0\n\n\u2202\u03a91\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n+ \u03bc0 N + (\u03bc1 + \u03bc2 )N + . . . .\n\n+ \u03a92 (\u03bc0 )\n\u03bc0\n\n(8)\n\nUsing Eq. (7), we find\nF (N) = F0 (N) + \u03a91 (\u03bc0 ) + \u03a92 (\u03bc0 ) \u2212\n\n1 (\u2202\u03a91 /\u2202\u03bc)2\n2 \u2202 2 \u03a90 /\u2202\u03bc2\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n\u03bc0\n\nwhere F0 (N) = \u03a90 (\u03bc0 ) + \u03bc0 N is the free energy of the non-interacting system. Since we neglect the contribution of 3N interactions in second-order diagrams, we consistently keep only the first-order NN part \u03a91,NN in the term\n4\n\n\f(\u2202\u03a91 /\u2202\u03bc)2 |\u03bc0 . Consequently, we have\n\uf8ee\n\n1 (\u2202\u03a91,NN /\u2202\u03bc)2\nF (N) = F0 (N) + \u03a91 (\u03bc0 ) + \u03a92,n (\u03bc0 ) + \uf8f0\u03a92,a (\u03bc0 ) \u2212\n2 \u2202 2 \u03a90 /\u2202\u03bc2\n\n\u03bc0\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n. (10)\n\nAccording to the Kohn-Luttinger-Ward theorem [18,19], the term in the square\nbrackets vanishes at T = 0 for isotropic, normal Fermi systems, since the\nanomalous diagram cancels against the contribution induced in \u03a91,NN by the\nshift of the chemical potential. Thus, the above expansion ensures that the\nT \u2192 0 limit is correctly reproduced.\nIn the T \u2192 0 limit \u03bc0 = \u01ebF = kF2 /(2m), where kF is the Fermi momentum, and\nthe ground state energy of the interacting system is given by F \u2192 E = E0 +\n\u03a91 (\u01ebF ) + \u03a92,n (\u01ebF ) + . . .. For a momentum-independent contact interaction, the\nsquare bracket in Eq. (10) vanishes at all temperatures, since in this case the\nHF self-energy is momentum independent. Consequently, the thermodynamic\npotential derived from the free energy Eq. (10) corresponds exactly to the\nloop expansion around the HF energy. For finite-range interactions, the HF\nself-energy is momentum dependent, and the cancellation is exact only in the\nzero-temperature limit. At finite temperature, the momentum dependence of\nthe HF self-energy is therefore treated perturbatively.\nThe pressure, entropy and energy follow from the free energy using standard\nthermodynamic relations.

Note that the\n5\n\n\fmomentum-conserving delta function is not included in the NN matrix elements.\nIn neutron matter, the effect of 3N interactions is expected to be smaller\nthan in symmetric matter, since the Pauli principle prevents three neutrons\nfrom interacting in a relative S-state. In the evaluation of the first-order 3N\ndiagram, (1,3N) in Fig. 1, we follow Ref. [13].

As\ndiscussed in Ref. [15], we use the ci constants extracted by the Nijmegen group\nin a partial wave analysis with chiral 2\u03c0-exchange [23]: c1 = \u22120.76 GeV\u22121 and\nc3 = \u22124.78 GeV\u22121 , where the dominant contribution is due to c3 . The lowenergy constants ci are within errors consistent with the determination from\n\u03c0N data [24], but at present c3 has a large theoretical uncertainty \u2248 25%,\nwhich is not included in our error bands (see however Fig. 6). For the 3N\ncontribution, we have the regulator [15]\n\"\n\np2 + 3q 2 /4\nfR (p, q) = exp \u2212\n\u039b2\n\n!4 #\n\n(15)\n\nwhere p and q are Jacobi momenta. Based on the nuclear matter results of\nRef. [13], we expect that the c3 term is repulsive and the dominant part of the\n3N contribution, and that the c1 term is small.\n\n2.2 Second-order anomalous and normal diagrams\nThe second-order anomalous contribution, (2,a) in Fig. 1, is given by\n\u03a92,a\n1\n=\u2212\nV\n2T\n\n3\nY\n\ni=1\n\nTr\u03c3i\n\nZ\n\ndki\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n!\n\nnk1 nk2 (1 \u2212 nk2 ) nk3\n\n\u00d7 h12 | Vlow k (1 \u2212 P12 ) | 12ih23 | Vlow k (1 \u2212 P12 ) | 23i .\n\n(16)\n\nWe note that in the HF approximation, all tadpole self-energy insertions,\nincluding the anomalous diagram (2,a), are included in the HF mean-field.\n6\n\n\fHence, in a loop expansion around the HF solution, the first anomalous\ndiagrams are of fourth order and involve two second-order self-energy insertions in place of the tadpoles in diagram (2,a). As discussed above, the\npresent approach is equivalent to a loop expansion around the HF energy for\na momentum-independent contact interaction. It follows that the contribution from the square bracket in Eq. (10) is small, although the anomalous\ndiagram (2,a) is significant. The reasons are: First, at zero temperature the\nsquare bracket vanishes, and therefore the contribution is small at low temperatures, and second, at finite temperature it is non zero only due to the\nweak momentum dependence of the HF self-energy in neutron matter.\nThe second-order normal diagram, (2,n) in Fig. 1, reads\n\n\u03a92,n\n1\n=\u2212\nV\n8\n\u00d7\n\n4\nY\n\ni=1\n\nTr\u03c3i\n\nZ\n\ndki\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n!\n\n(2\u03c0)3 \u03b4(k1 + k2 \u2212 k3 \u2212 k4 )\n\nnk1 nk2 (1 \u2212 nk3 )(1 \u2212 nk4 ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 nk1 )(1 \u2212 nk2 ) nk3 nk4\n\u01ebk3 + \u01ebk4 \u2212 \u01ebk1 \u2212 \u01ebk2\n2\n\n\u00d7 h12 | Vlow k (1 \u2212 P12 ) | 34i .\n\n(17)\n\nExpanding in partial waves and performing the spin traces, we find\n\nX\n\nhk SMS | Vlow k (1 \u2212 P12 ) | k\u2032 SMS\u2032 i\n\n2\n\nS,MS ,MS\u2032\n\n=\n\nX\n\nPL (cos \u03b8k,k\u2032 )\n\nL\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nJ, l, l\u2032 , S J,\ne el, e\nl\u2032\n\nee\u2032 e\n\n\u2032\n\ne e\u2032\n\n(4\u03c0)2 i(l\u2212l +l\u2212l )\n\u0010\n\nJ l lS\n\u2032\n\u2032\nJ l lS\nl+S+1\n\u00d7 hk | Vlow\nk | k ihk | Vlow k | ki 1 \u2212 (\u22121)\n\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\nq\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\ne\n\n1 \u2212 (\u22121)l+S+1\ne\n\n\u0011\n\n(2l + 1)(2l\u2032 + 1)(2le + 1)(2le\u2032 + 1) (2J + 1)(2Je + 1) (\u22121)l+l +L\n\nl 0 le\u2032 0 | L 0\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\nl\n\n\u2032\n\n0 el 0 | L 0\n\n(\n\u0011\n\nl S J\n\nJe L le\u2032\n\n)(\n\nJ S l\u2032\n\nle L Je\n\n)\n\n,\n\n\u2032\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03b8k,k\u2032 is the angle between relative momenta k = (k1 \u2212 k2 )/2 and k\u2032 =\n(k3 \u2212 k4 )/2.

The virial\ncurve ends where the fugacity z = e\u03bc/T = 0.5.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nWe compute the different contributions to the free energy using the adaptive\nMonte Carlo integration routine Vegas [25]. Our results 1 for the free energy\nper particle are shown in Fig. 2 for temperatures T = 3 MeV, 6 MeV and\n10 MeV, where the low-momentum interaction Vlow k is obtained from the Argonne v18 potential [27] for a cutoff \u039b = 2.1 fm\u22121 . The cutoff dependence of\nthe free energy can be used to provide lower limits for the theoretical uncertainty in the calculation, since the result should be cutoff independent when\nall relevant contributions are included. For the T = 6 MeV results, we provide\nerror estimates by varying the cutoff over the range \u039b = 1.9 fm\u22121 (lower curve)\nto \u039b = 2.5 fm\u22121 (upper curve). The cutoff dependence of the T = 3 MeV and\n10 MeV results here and in the following is of similar size. As expected, the\nerror grows with increasing density. Moreover, we observe that the equation\nof state becomes significantly less cutoff dependent with the inclusion of the\nsecond-order NN contributions.\nIn Fig. 2, we also compare our results for the free energy to the modelindependent virial equation of state [21] and to the variational calculations\n1\n\nWe take the opportunity to correct an error in Ref.

The virial expansion provides a benchmark for low densities\nand high temperatures, where the interparticle separation is large compared\nto the thermal wavelength. We find a very good agreement with the virial free\nenergy. Including second-order NN contributions to the HF free energy brings\nour results closer to the FP calculations, but this trend is opposite for other\nthermodynamic potentials, see for instance the entropy in Fig. 4.\nThe FP results are based on zero-temperature Fermi-hypernetted-chain correlation functions, with the effective mass as a finite-temperature variational\nparameter [28]. We note that the density of states at the Fermi surface is\nunderestimated in variational calculations of this type, since the energy dependence of the self energy is properly accounted for only when correlation\ndiagrams are included [29]. In a variational scheme this can be achieved in\ncorrelated basis perturbation theory [30,31]. This effect is in part included in\nthe induced interaction, which in neutron matter leads to an enhancement of\nthe effective mass by \u2248 10% (see the RG results for the Fermi liquid parameter F1 /3 = m\u2217 /m \u2212 1 in Fig. 6 of Ref. [32]). The enhancement of the effective\nmass near the Fermi surface is reflected in an increase of the entropy and the\nspecific heat over the variational result at low temperatures [31] (see below).\nThe pressure P and the entropy per particle S/N are shown in Figs. 3 and 4.\nAs for the free energy, we find a very good agreement with the virial equation\nof state at low densities, and the inclusion of second-order contributions significantly decreases the cutoff dependence.

For higher densities, we find a larger\npressure and entropy. We emphasize that the results are based on different\nHamiltonians, and therefore the comparison has to be taken with care. However, the dominant source for the difference in the entropy is likely due to differences in the effective masses, since the entropy density of a low-temperature\nFermi liquid is proportional to the effective mass, s = m\u2217 kF T /3 [33].

[35].\n\nthe Fermi surface and consequently also the entropy at low temperatures.\nOur results for the energy per particle are presented in Fig. 5. As for the\nfree energy, we observe additional binding and a significantly reduced cutoff dependence at second order. In contrast to the variational calculation of\nFP [22], the low-density behavior at second order is in good agreement with\nthe virial equation of state [21]. This highlights the importance of a correct\nfinite-temperature treatment of second and higher-order contributions. Note\nthat the error in the virial equation of state (due to the neglected third virial\ncoefficient) increases with density. This error is not shown in Fig. 5, but will be\ndiscussed in future work on understanding the transition from the perturbative\nto the virial approach.\nA comparison of our low-temperature results to the T = 0 energy per particle\nprovides an independent check of our calculations and of the generalized loop\nexpansion. In Fig. 6 we show the energy per particle for T = 1.5 MeV for a\ncutoff \u039b = 2.1 fm\u22121 and the corresponding T = 0 equation of state. The latter\nextends the HF results for neutron matter of Refs. [32,34] to include 3N forces\nand (normal) second-order NN contributions using an angle-averaged Pauli\nblocking operator (see Ref. [13] for details). Except at low densities, where\nE/N \u2192 3/2T , we find that the T = 1.5 MeV energy closely follows the zero\ntemperature results.\n11\n\n\fIn Fig. 6 we provide an error band for the T = 0 equation of state based\non the cutoff variation. The width of this band is of the same size as for\nT = 6 MeV in Fig. 5. At this level of 3N interactions (leading chiral EFT 3N\nin HF), only the 2\u03c0-exchange part with low-energy constants ci contribute,\nand therefore there are no adjustable 3N parameters. Since the ci constants\nare cutoff independent, their uncertainties are not fully captured by the cutoff\nvariation, and we therefore directly assess how the presently large uncertainties\nin ci propagate to theoretical uncertainties in the neutron matter equation of\nstate at this level. The resulting error estimate in Fig. 6 is based on c1 =\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22120.9+0.2\nand c3 = \u22124.7+1.2\nfrom Ref. [24]. It is clear that at\n\u22120.5 GeV\n\u22121.0 GeV\npresent the theoretical uncertainties in 3N interactions overwhelm the error\ndue to an approximate many-body treatment for these densities.\nWe can also compare the T = 0 energy per particle at low densities to the\nthe model-independent di-fermion EFT results [17] based directly on the large\nneutron-neutron scattering length and effective range. Our results are consistent with the di-fermion EFT energy per particle within errors. Finally, the\nresults of Akmal et al. [35] (based on the Argonne v18 and Urbana IX potential)\nlie within our error band as well (including the ci uncertainties). The Urbana\n\u22121\n[36],\nIX 3N interaction corresponds to the \u2206 contribution, c\u2206\n3 = \u22123.83 GeV\nand therefore results in less repulsion (with weaker c3 ). These results show\nthat, at present, understanding 3N interactions is a frontier for nuclear matter at the extremes.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThis work is part of a program to improve the nuclear equation of state for\nastrophysics. One of the central objectives is to quantify the theoretical uncertainties in the microscopic nuclear physics input, and to explore the impact\non supernovae and neutron stars, for example, through predictions of neutron\nstar masses and radii.\nIn this first study of neutron matter, we have computed the equation of\nstate at subsaturation densities and temperatures T 6 10 MeV based on lowmomentum NN and 3N interactions. We have generalized the perturbative\napproach [13] to finite temperature, where the free energy is obtained from a\nloop expansion around the HF energy and the momentum dependence of the\nself-energy is treated perturbatively. Our results include first-order NN and 3N\ncontributions, as well as anomalous and normal second-order diagrams with\nNN interactions. The pressure, entropy and energy were then calculated using\nstandard thermodynamic relations. While the HF energy is sizable (and nonperturbative for finite nuclei), the finite-temperature loop expansion around\nthe HF energy seems to be tractable. This is due to a combination of Pauli\n12\n\n\fblocking [13] and an appreciable effective range [17].\nThe virial expansion provides a model-independent equation of state for nuclear matter at low density and high temperature [20,21], and our perturbative\nresults meet this benchmark. This is very promising, since it will enable us to\nmatch the virial equation of state to microscopic calculations based on NN and\n3N interactions at higher densities. The comparison of our results to the virial\nenergy per particle highlights the importance of a correct finite-temperature\ntreatment of second and higher-order correlations, which are included only\nin an average sense in the variational calculations of Ref. [22]. The correct\ntreatment of thermally-excited low-lying states leads to an enhancement of\nthe effective mass at the Fermi surface and consequently to an increase in the\nentropy, as shown in Fig. 4.\nWe have provided simple estimates for the theoretical error by varying the\ncutoff in low-momentum interactions. This is a powerful tool to assess theoretical errors due to neglected higher-order many-body forces and due to an\napproximate many-body treatment. We found that the equation of state becomes significantly less cutoff dependent with the inclusion of second-order\ncontributions, and that the cutoff dependence is small for \u03c1 . 0.1 fm\u22123 . We\nnote that the errors of the free energy are correlated between different temperatures and grow with increasing density. The first observation implies a\nrelatively small error in the entropy (obtained by a temperature derivative),\nand consequently similar errors for the energy per particle. The second observation explains the relatively large error band for the pressure (obtained from\na density derivative). Finally, we have shown that the uncertainties due to\nthe long-range parts of 3N interactions, the ci constants, are substantial and\noverwhelm the error bands from the cutoff variation at this level. We conclude\nthat understanding 3N forces is a frontier in microscopic calculations of the\nnuclear equation of state, and furthermore that the possibility of estimating\ntheoretical uncertainties is an important step towards reliable extrapolations\nto astrophysical conditions.\nFuture work will include systematic studies of the range of validity, quantifying\nan expansion parameter for the loop expansion, calculations for asymmetric\nmatter, improving the uncertainties at higher densities, how they propagate\nto astrophysical observables, and understanding the transition to the virial\nexpansion.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Scott Bogner, Dick Furnstahl and Chuck Horowitz for useful discussions.
