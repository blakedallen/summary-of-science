Introduction\nRecently a new field of electronics called spin electronics or just spintronics has been\nrapidly developing. In comparison with conventional electronics the most obvious\nadvantage the spintronics offers is a possibility of controlling current flowing through\nmesoscopic or nanoscopic systems with magnetic field, by making use of the spin degree\nof freedom of electron. The well-known example illustrating this, is the famous giant\nmagnetoresistance (GMR) effect, initially discovered in all-metal multilayers [1], and\nnext also in all-semiconductor tunnel junctions [2], and molecular systems [3]. Here\nthe main interest will be focused on a very peculiar class of the latter - namely carbon\nnanotubes (CNT) [4]. The GMR effect can only be observed when some parts of a\ncircuit (usually electrodes) are ferromagnetic, then magnetic field polarizes them making\nthereby the electrical transport spin-dependent (see e.g [5, 6] for excellent state-of-theart reviews). Quite interesting quantum effects do also appear in non-magnetic systems\nin the presence of external magnetic field. The carbon nanotube are quite exceptional in\nthis context, as they may undergo magnetic field-induced major changes in their energy\nband structure, resulting even in turning a metallic CNT into a semiconductor or vice\nversa. This phenomenon, predicted theoretically [7, 9], has been recently confirmed\nexperimentally, so it is clear now that axial magnetic field, if strong enough, may\nlead to successive opening and closing of an energy gap between the conduction and\nvalence bands. Some of these phenomena occurring in CNTs, e.g the Aharonov-Bohm\n(AB) effect, as well as conductance oscillations in perpendicular magnetic field due to\nthe Landau-like quantization will be also addressed in the sequel. It is noteworthy\nthat very much like the GMR effect, believed to have practical applications in CNTbased spintronic devices, also the AB effect in nanotubes might be used to construct\nmagneto-optical or magneto-electrical switches. One of the objectives of this study is to\nelucidate the importance of size effects directly related to miniaturization problems and\nthe possibility of using tiny CNTs as elements of functional devices and interconnects in\nnanoelectronics. Ultra short CNTs, with comparable circumferences and lengths, have\nnot yet been experimentally studied as far as their transport properties are concerned,\nin spite of the fact that some other ultra short molecular systems, including fullerene,\nwere successfully electrically contacted and measured ([10], [11]). The shortest carbon\nnanotube segments operated with so far have been about 20 nm long [12]. Such segments\nmay be created with an AFM tip in a double-buckle nanotube form.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2 the computational method based on a\ntight-binding model is shortly outlined. Sec. 3 is devoted to the GMR effect, whereas\nin the subsequent section (Sec. 4) the effect of magnetic field on electrical transport is\ndiscussed. Finally main results of the paper are summarized.\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n3\n\n2. Methodology and Modelling\nWe use a tight-binding model for non-interacting \u03c0-electrons within nanotubes and selectrons in each of the two metal-electrodes. In the case of ferromagnetic electrodes\nthe s-electron spin-split band is supposed to mimic d bands of real transition metals.\nThe total Hamiltonian reads\nH=\n\nX\n\ni,j,\u03c3\n\nti,j |i, \u03c3i h\u03c3, j| +\n\nX\ni,\u03c3\n\n\u01ebi,\u03c3 |i, \u03c3i h\u03c3, i| ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere i and j run over the whole device (i.e the CNT itself and the electrodes), \u03c3\nis the spin index, and ti,j and \u01ebi,\u03c3 stand for the hopping integrals and the on-site\npotentials, respectively. This is an independent-electron model, applicable in the case\nof high-transparency contacts, and a relatively long mean free-path, i.e. when electrical\ntransport can be regarded as quasi-ballistic ([13] - [16]).\nCarbon nanotubes have been simulated by means of codes based on those of Ref. [9]\n(see Appendix therein). The model electrodes are fcc(1,1,1) leads infinite in all the 3\ndirections contacted to CNTs via a constriction composed of 2 finite atomic planes\nof each electrode. So the whole system (device) considered here is end-contacted, in\ncontrast to other wide-spread geometries, like those of side-contact- and embeddedcontact-schemes. The device has been relaxed in order to find energetically favorable\npositions of interface atoms. The interface metal atoms have been modelled by spheres\ndM =2.51 \u00c5 in diameter (this figure roughly fits to the most common metal electrodes).\nCarbon atoms in turn, have been represented by smaller spheres with diameter equal\nto dC = 1.421 \u00c5. Using simple geometrical arguments it is assumed that interface CNT\natoms tend to be as close as possible to their neighboring metal atoms (big spheres).\nSo the Lennard-Jones potential (any other would also work) is simply (\u03c3/r)12 \u2212 (\u03c3/r)6\nwith a parameter \u03c3 = (dM + dC )/2 and an irrelevant pre-factor set to 1. Hereafter,\nthe CNT together with the aforementioned extra atomic planes will be referred to as\nthe extended molecule. The way the on-site (\u01ebi ) potentials are determined is as follows.\nFirst the \u01ebi -s are set equal to those of separated components of the device, i.e. for\nCNTs \u01ebi = 0 (charge neutrality point), and for electrodes \u2013 to a certain nonzero-value\nchosen so as to give a required number of electrons per atom. In the ferromagnetic case\nspin-dependent on-site potentials must additionally give a required magnetic moment\nper atom. This has been implemented by making a rigid band (Stoner) splitting in the\nmetal electrodes. The on-site potentials referring to intrinsically non-magnetic carbon\natoms have not been split. Of course when the electrodes are magnetic (Sec. 3), selfconsistent calculations result in inducing slight magnetic moments at interface carbon\natoms. In the present model calculations an average number of electrons per metal\natom is equal to n=1 and its spin polarization, defined as P = 100(n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 )/(n\u2191 + n\u2193 ),\nquals 50%. Second, an extra self-consistent potential has been added to diagonal matrix\nelements of the Hamiltonian referring to the extended molecule. At the first step of the\nself-consistency loop a self-consistent potential is set 0, whereas during the next steps\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n4\n\nit is modified so as to give no global charge excess on the extended molecule, with the\ntotal charge given by the trace of the density matrix n\u0302 (Eq. 3, see below). This simple\nprocedure makes it possible to line up the CNT and metal electron energy bands, and fix\nthe position of the Fermi level, in particular. As an example, Fig. 1 shows the number\nof electrons per atom in a device composed of infinitely large electrodes (in the x, y, z\ndirections, not shown) end-contacted via finite two-plane necks (A, B) to a (24, 24)-CNT\n(region C). Figure 1 is a 1-d visualization of a 3-d system with atoms aligned as in a\nchain, so atoms labelled with consecutive numbers are usually not nearest neighbors.\nAbrupt charge changes visible in this figure in the A and B regions are due to edge atoms\nwith reduced neighborhood, which do not contribute effectively to electron scattering.\nIt is instructive to note that our simple model gives a qualitatively correct physical\npicture with strong oscillations in the number of electrons per atom in the vicinity of\nthe interface which next get weakened and die down. It should be however made clear\nthat a more direct way to align the Fermi levels, while dealing with real electrodes,\nwould consist in taking into account work functions (WF) of involved materials (carbon\nvs. metal). In fact the work function of a CNT is usually supposed to be roughly\nequal to that of the graphite i.e. 4.5 eV (as a matter of fact it is however chirality-\n\n0.60\n\nIDOS\n\n0.55\n\n0.50\n\n0.45\n\n0.40\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\n0.35\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\n# atom\n\nFigure 1.

The former typically results in transferring charge from the CNT\nto the electrode, whereas the latter \u2013 the other way round. As it follows from Fig. 1,\nthe model under consideration here mimics the former case, with a noticeable electron\ndeficit at the CNT interface.\nThe Green function of the extended molecule (GC ), as well as the density matrix\n(n\u0302) and the conductance per spin (G) are defined in a standard way as\nGC = (E \u2212 HC \u2212 \u03a3L \u2212 \u03a3R )\u22121 ,\n\n(2)\n\n1\nn\u0302 =\n2\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nG=\n\nZ\n\ndE GC (fL \u0393L + fR \u0393R ) GC \u2020 ,\n\no\ne2 n\nTr \u0393L GC \u0393R GC \u2020 ,\nh\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the respective subscripts C, L and R refer to the extended molecule (central\npart) and the left and right electrodes. In contrast to rather common wide-band\ntype approximations, the present method is based on self-energies (\u03a3 matrices) which\nare energy-dependent and have been expressed in terms of recursively computed\nsurface Green functions g(E) of infinite leads (electrodes) as well as the extendedmolecule/electrode coupling matrices V :\n\u03a3\u03b1 = V g\u03b1 V \u2020 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe other quantities in Eq. (3) are the line-width (or broadening) matrices \u0393\u03b1 =\ni(\u03a3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03a3\u2020\u03b1 ) and the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions f\u03b1 , with \u03b1 = L, R.\n3. Giant magnetoresistance in ferromagnetically contacted carbon\nnanotubes\nSince the pioneering paper on the GMR effect in CNT-based devices was published\n[4], there has been a lot of interest in electrical transport through ferromagnetically\ncontacted nanotubes. It is now clear that the spin diffusion length in nanotubes is\nquite long, and often exceeds a separation length between source and drain electrodes,\nwhich is routinely made as short as a few hundred nm nowadays. This means that the\nCNT may be quite attractive for spintronic application either as interconnects or active\nelements. So far most of GMR experiments on CNTs have been performed on relatively\nhigh resistive devices [4, 20, 21], corresponding to the tunnelling regime with resistance\n(R) of the order of M\u03a9. Notably, quite recently the Basel group [22, 23] succeeded in\nfabricating devices whose resistance was substantially decreased down to the order of\nquantum resistance (h/e2 = 26.8 k\u03a9). It is well-known from independent studies of\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n6\n\nthe Stanford [24] and Basel [25] groups that Pd makes excellent contacts with CNTs.\nThe above-mentioned new highly transparent ferromagnetic contacts do also contain\npalladium (Pd0.3 Ni0.7 alloy). In what follows, we calculate the giant magnetoresistance,\ndefined (in a \"pessimistic way\") as\nGMR = (G\u2191,\u2191 \u2212 G\u2191,\u2193 )/G\u2191,\u2191 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the arrows denote the aligned and anti-aligned magnetizations of the metal\nelectrodes, with G defined by Eq. 4. A system under consideration is an (8,8)SWCNT both disorder-free and disordered. The Anderson type disorder is introduced\nby randomizing carbon on-site potentials and letting them vary in an interval [-W/2,\nW/2], where the disorder parameter W is set to 0.2t. This simple approach is intended\nto test whether or not in the case of GMR, a multiwall CNT can effectively be treated as\nequivalent to just its outer shall subjected to some perturbation from the inner shells.\nThis hypothesis is generally believed to be acceptable by both theorists [26, 27] and\nexperimentalists [28, 29]. Figure 2 shows how the GMR effect gets modified under\nthe influence of Anderson-disorder. The obvious observations are that disorder destroys\nperiodicity of GMR and decreases its absolute value from roughly 20% ([17],[18]) down to\na few per cent simultaneously reducing tendency of GMR to become negative. All these\nfeatures are in accord with experimental data on GMR in multiwall carbon nanotubes\n(MWCNTs) with transparent ferromagnetic contacts [22, 23]. The most notable effect\nof the disorder is removing of the characteristic energy scale (\u2206E) in the conductance\n\ndisordered\ndisorder free\n\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n\nGMR\n\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n-0.05\n-0.10\n-0.15\n-0.20\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nE\n\nFigure 2.

The latter is computed from the\ndisorder-averaged conductances (over 100 random configurations), standard-deviation\nerror bars are also shown. The presented energy range is close to the charge neutrality\npoint (E=0), with the hopping integral chosen as the energy unit (|t|=2.7 eV).\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n7\n\nspectrum. In the quasi-ballistic regime \u2206E is related with energy-level spacings, and\nscales inversely proportional to the CNT length (see e.g. [30]). For less transparent\ncontacts \u2206E must be completed with a charging energy, i.e. the so-called addition\nenergy is to replace the \u2206E parameter. The double-peak structure visible in Fig. 2\n(dotted curve) results from lifting of the spin degeneracy by the ferromagnetic electrodes.\nThe splitting effect is however too subtle to be visible in the presence of disorder (solid\ncurve).\n4. Nanotubes in parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields\nAs regards a parallel (axial) field configuration, it was predicted theoretically that\nmagnetic field can drastically change electronic band structure of carbon nanotubes\n[7, 9]. This may lead to opening of the energy gap in an initially metallic CNT\nand turn it into a semiconducting one. The same applies to a semiconducting CNT,\nwhich may reveal a more and more reduced gap with increasing magnetic field, and\neventually become metallic. Recently, two important experimental papers have been\npublished, that fully confirm aforementioned scenarios. The first one [31] visualizes in\na direct way magnetic flux modulation of the energy gap in high-diameter MWCNTs,\nwith an outer radius of about 15 nm which makes it possible to get the magnetic\nflux quantum \u03a60 = h/e at accessible fields of B \u223c 6T. The AB effect can also be\ndetected in much thinner single-wall carbon nanotubes, typically a few nm in diameter,\nalthough in this case obviously just a small part of the AB phase comes into play,\nnevertheless it is detectable by means of magneto-optical techniques under pulsed\nmagnetic fields [32]. In this section we generalize the hitherto existing theoretical\nstudies restricted to free CNTs, by taking into account the presence of electrodes and\nthereby on the one hand, the accompanying charge transfer, and on the other hand\n- the energy level broadening which becomes quite crucial for ultra short CNTs with\ntransparent contacts. Incidentally, the charge transfer problem is seldom addressed in\ntheoretical papers devoted to magnetoresistance problems, as it requires integration\nover all occupied states and makes calculations extremely computer-time consuming\nand expensive. Therefore theoreticians often skip the charge transfer issue and restrict\nthemselves only to conductance calculations, which may be carried out just at the Fermi\nenergy (or within a narrow \"transport energy window\"). The present studies go beyond\nthis limitation.\nWe use the well-known Peierls substitution [9]\nt \u2212\u2192 t exp[i2\u03c0\u03c6/\u03a60 ].\n\n(7)\n\nThe factor \u03c6 is defined in terms of a magnetic flux \u03a6 = B\u03c0( C2\u03c0h )2 penetrating a cross\u221a\nsection of the (m,n) CNT with perimeter Ch = a n2 + m2 + mn, where B stands for a\nuniform static magnetic field and the graphene lattice constant a = 2.49\u00c5 is a length\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n8\n\nunit of the theory\n\u2206x\n\u03a6,\nparallel field\nCh\n\"\n#\n(8)\n\u03c6 = \u0012 \u00132\n\uf8f4\n2\u03c0x\n2\u03c0(x + \u2206x)\nCh B\u2206y\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ncos\n, perpendicular field.\n\u2212 cos\n\uf8f3\n2\u03c0\n\u2206x\nCh\nCh\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nCircumferential and axial coordinates of carbon atoms are x, x + \u2206x, and y, y + \u2206y,\nrespectively. It is noteworthy that within the present approach magnetic field enters\nnot only off-diagonal block-elements of the Hamiltonian (via the Peierls substitution)\nbut also the diagonal ones through the Zeeman splitting, \u00b1 21 g\u03bcB B. The relevance of\nthe Zeeman splitting in the AB effect is often underestimated, but theoretical results of\n[33] as well as measurements presented in [31] show that it can lead to fairly pronounced\neffects. In fact the Zeeman splitting is taken into account here not only within the CNT\nbut also in metal leads, since in the case of small-size devices there is no way to apply\nmagnetic field locally without interfering the electrodes. The Peierls substitution has not\nhowever been applied to contacts. The reason is that it could be hardly implemented in\nthe present recursive calculation scheme of infinite electrodes. Fundamentally different\ngeometries of the SWCNTs and contacts, as well as strong screening effects within the\n(metal) contacts justify additionally this approximation.

In fact the same\neffect occurs for a much smaller EF -shift provided the energy-level widths, originating\nfrom a strong CNT-electrode coupling are broad enough (Inset (b)).\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n9\n\nBohm oscillations in selected (n,n)-SWCNTs contacted to the model paramagnetic\nfcc-(1,1,1) electrodes. It is shown that conductance is a quasi-periodic function of \u03a6\nwith a period equal to \u03a60 . Remarkably, in general the conductance does not drop to\nzero at \u03a6 = \u03a60 /2. This might have been due to the fact that there is some charge\ntransfer in the system which locates the Fermi energy beyond a magnetic field-induced\nenergy gap (see the inset a). In fact however it results from the calculations that the\naccompanying energy shift is by far smaller than half the magnetic field-induced energygap. To understand the situation it must be realized that in devices with transparent\ncontacts energy levels are quite broad. A zero-field energy level spacing \u03b4E is strongly\n\u221a\ndependent on nanotube axial length (L). In the ballistic regime \u03b4E = \u03c0 3 |t| a/(2L)\nand the energy level broadening also scales as 1/L [30]. Thus for small-size nanotubes\nstudied in this section with L \u223c 20a \u2013 40a, the energy-level width turns out to be\ncomparable with the energy-gap \u2206E. These two energy scales are close to each other\nbecause of comparable magnitudes of the perimeter (sampled with the axial field) and\nthe length. So a crucial role should be ascribe to the interplay between the energy-level\nbroadening effect and the magnetic field-induced energy gap whose maximum value is\nproportional to the inverse nanotube radius. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 3 the AB\neffect is very strongly dependent on the nanotube perimeter as far as the collapse of\nmetal-semiconductor switching ability is concerned.

The comparison of the panels shows clearly\nthat energy levels are considerably broadened in electrically contacted nanotubes.\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n10\n\ncircumference-to-length ratio close to unity. This is clearly visible for the SWCNTs with\nn=16 (perimeter Ch =7nm), which still have a considerable conductance at \u03a6/\u03a60 =0.5\nfor L=5 nm (middle curve), but not for L=10 nm (dashed curve). It implies that if\nassumptions of the present theory were fulfilled then, e.g. a (150,150) CNT would lose\nits magneto-electrical switching efficiency for a length below ca 65 nm.\nIf the CNTs in question are nominally semiconducting zigzag-type ones, then again\na quasi-period of the conduction oscillations is \u03a60 , but depending on the degree of\ndoping, the nanotube perimeter (which determines the number of sub-bands and the\n\u221a\nmaximum energy-gap, 2\u2206E = 2\u03c0 |t| /( 3 n)) as well as the length (responsible for\nthe number of energy levels within a sub-band), one gets 2- and 3-peak conductance\ncurves. In principle, the peak positions might be explained in terms of the AjikiAndo theory [7] and the aforementioned arguments about the interplay between the\ndoping, the energy gap-width and the energy-level broadening. It results from Fig. 4\nthat deviations from the AA theory are large for short-length CNTs, and they manifest\nthemselves by broadening of conductance peaks and disappearance of a conductance gap\nat \u03a6/\u03a60 = 0.5. Incidentally a noticeable asymmetry in the conductance peak-widths\nin Fig. 4 results from the Zeeman splitting which increases with the magnetic field.

Same as Fig. 4 but for a (28,0)-SWCNT. The lower panel represents a\npossible interpretation of the upper one within the AA theory. In fact however the\nFermi energy is always very close to E=0, but the energy level widths are of the order\nof \u2206E/2 for ultra short devices (cf Inset (b) in Fig. 3).\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n11\n\nin the bottom panels of Figs. 4 and 5. The slanting lines over there represent the lowest\nenergy level evolution as a function of magnetic flux (no Zeeman splitting is shown for\nclarity). Ideally the CNTs remain semiconducting except at the crossing points, where\nthe energy gap gets closed. Indeed some traces of such a behavior are really displayed by\nthese two figures. However the EF -shift, as depicted in Fig. 5 (bottom horizontal line)\nis unrealistically large and inconsistent with the numerical results. As a matter of fact\nthe actual EF -shift is by more than one order of magnitude smaller than that (about 20\ntimes), nevertheless the energy gaps get closed due to exceptionally broad energy levelwidths occurring in these small-size devices having perimeters comparable with a length.\nActually the AA theory in its conventional version applies to perfect, infinite CNTs of\narbitrary chirality. It is however restricted to a low energy region in the energy spectrum\n(\"light-cone\" approximation) and disregards external contacts and any possible charging\neffects. Nevertheless our results show that there are reminiscences of major AA features\neven under more complicated conditions than those originally assumed. It is interesting\nto note that the conductance spectra are spin-dependent due to the Zeeman splitting\n(up-triangles and down-triangles in Fig. 5) for high enough \u03a6 (\u223c \u03a60 /6). This suggests\nthat in the quasi-ballistic regime a spin polarization of the current flowing through the\nCNT appears to be controllable by the magnetic field strength.\nTurning now to the perpendicular field, we focused our attention on the armchair\nSWCNTs (5 nm long) and the (28,0)-zigzag one which have been studied above for\nthe axial geometry. Figure 6 shows magnetic field - conductance dependence of these\nnanotubes.\nRemarkable features of the plot are that the conductances reveal oscillations with a\ndecreasing amplitude and asymptotically approach the upper theoretical limit of 4e2 /h\nat huge fields. These features can be accounted for by the factqthat energy bands get\nnarrower and narrower as B increases (magnetic length lm = \u03a60 /(2\u03c0B) decreases),\nand eventually form Landau-like levels, with a decreasing but always finite width.\nIt was shown in [34, 35] that interface conditions as well as charges in a nanotube\nlength can bring an armchair nanotube to or out of the so-called on-resonance state\nwith a conductance peak at the Fermi level (nota bene the off-resonance state has a\nconductance dip at EF ). Experimentally such a tuning is realized more conveniently\nby means of a gate voltage. As regards the magnetic field, it spoils the on-resonance\nconductance and improves the off-resonance one. It was verified that indeed, there\nis such a competition responsible for the behavior of the magneto-conductance curves\ndepicted in Fig. 6 for n=m=16 and 24, respectively. The first peak is due to promoting\nthe Zeeman-split \u2193-spin electron conductance from the off-resonance type at B=0 to the\non-resonance type at the first peak position, and roughly the opposite process in the\ncase of \u2191-spin electrons (see the inset). It turns out that the former process prevails\nleading to a slightly negative magnetoresistance (positive magnetoconductance). For\nn=8 in turn, initially the spin-dependent conductances give compensating contributions,\nresulting in nearly constant net conductance (up to 0.01). It should be stressed that the\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n12\n\n2 .0\n\n1 .5\n\n4 .0\n\n1 .0\n0\n\n0 .0 1\n\n3 .5\n\n2 .5\n\nG\n\n2\n\n[e /h ]\n\n3 .0\n\n2 .0\n\n(m ,n)- S W C N T\n\n(8 ,8 )\n\n1 .5\n\n(1 6 ,1 6 )\n\n1 .0\n\n(2 4 ,2 4 )\n(2 8 ,0 )\n\n0 .5\n0 .0 0\n\n0 .0 1\n\n0 .0 2\n\n0 .0 3\n\n0 .0 4\n\n0 .0 5\n\nB [t]\n\nFigure 6. Magnetoconductance of (m,n)-SWCNTs at a perpendicular magnetic field.\nNote that quasi-periods of the curves scale inversely proportional with the CNT\ndiameter, and G tends to 4e2 /h. The inset shows spin-dependent contributions to\nthe total conductance for m=n=24 (G \u2193 - dotted line, G \u2191 - solid line).\n\ndescribed magnetoresistance mechanism develops within the quasi-ballistic regime in\nimpurity-free systems. The effects described above are weaker and of another field-scale\nthan the well-known interference phenomena, i.e. weak-localization (WL) and universal\nquantum fluctuations (UCF) [28, 29], and obviously the physics standing behind them\nis completely different. Experimentally the WL contribution can be identified on the\nbasis of its temperature-dependence, and the UCF one may be effectively suppressed\nupon gate voltage-averaging of the conductance [29]. So in the case of the simultaneous\npresence of the interference phenomena and the ballistic magnetoresistance described\nabove, the latter seems separable from the former ones.\nAnother point which needs commenting on is related with the fact that the present\ncalculations are restricted to thin nanotubes (with diameters up to 33 \u00c5). In the\nparallel field the AB oscillations have a well-defined periodicity (\u03a60 ) independently of the\nthickness, so the present findings could be applicable in a rather straightforward way to\nthick MWCNTs. In particular, the Aharonov-Bohm smearing, at the circumference-tolength ratio close to unity, shown here to be the inherent property of SWCNTs, should\nbe detectable e.g. in a (150, 150) CNT system (most probably even in the Coulombblockade regime, see [31]) upon improving contact transparency and introduction of two\nbuckles ca 20 nm away from each other.\nThe situation is more cumbersome for the perpendicular geometry, where, as seen\nin Fig. 6, the G(B) curves depend critically on the thicknesses involved, and there\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n13\n\nis no way to make a pseudo-universal plot (replacing \u03bcB B by a magnetic strength\nparameter \u03bd = R/lm with a radius R = Ch /(2\u03c0) does not help at all). However it\nresults from Fig. 6 that the first magnetoresistance peak roughly appears within the\ninterval 1 < \u03bd < 2, i.e. whenever the lowest Landau level emerges. So it is reasonable\nto anticipate that this trend will also be present in the case of thick CNTs if the\naforemention conditions (ballisticity and transparency) are fulfilled. So the expected\ncritical magnetic field at which magnetoresistance changes its sign would be, e.g. 6 - 12\nT for a (150,150)-CNT with a diameter \u223c 200\u00c5. Another argument in support to the\nsuggestion that magneto-conductance in perpendicular magnetic fields is directly related\nwith the Landau quantization is a finding that asymptotically for large B, conductance\nis no longer chirality-dependent and its behavior is totally determined by a nanotube\ndiameter. For instance the (16,16)-SWCNT curve of Fig. 6 closely resembles that for\na (28,0)-SWCNT (dashed curve) with practically the same diameter, for strong enough\n\u03bcB B. This means that magnetic field localizes electron wave-functions making thereby\ncircumferential boundary conditions irrelevant (cf [8]).\n5. Summary and conclusions\nIn this study the attention has been focused on a quasi-ballistic spin-dependent transport\nthrough carbon nanotubes contacted to two external electrodes. Unlike some other\nauthors, we use neither seamless electrodes (made also of CNTs) nor the so-called\nwide-band approximation. Moreover, while studying magnetic-field dependence of the\nconductance we have included the Zeeman splitting not only in the CNT alone but\nalso in the electrodes. So we have been in a position to take into account possible\ncharge transfer and spin-polarization effects, and estimate their combined impact on\nthe ballistic magnetoconductance.\nThe relevance of the spin-degree of freedom is demonstrated by taking into account\nthe following cases: (i) CNT sandwiched between ferromagnetic contacts, and (ii)\nnanotubes of various thickness, length and chirality placed in external magnetic field\noriented either parallel or perpendicular to the tube axis. In the former, it was shown\nthat the GMR effect in single-wall disorder-free CNTs may be quite large, exceeding 20%\nor so. The GMR is a quasi-periodic function of energy (controllable with a gate voltage)\nwith a period related to a characteristic energy-scale for the problem at hand, namely\nthe inter energy-level distance in the ballistic regime (and by analogy the addition energy\nin the Coulomb blockade case). Interestingly, as a function of energy the GMR may be\nboth positive and negative (inverse GMR) with roughly the same absolute value. Upon\nintroducing disorder, the situation substantially changes. Not only the amplitude of\nGMR decreases down to several percent but also its oscillations become aperiodic and\nthe inverse GMR is in practice no longer present, at least in the vicinity of the charge\nneutrality point. Once such features have been recently established experimentally on\nMWCNT with transparent ferromagnetic contacts, it seems that single-wall CNTs with\n\n\fTheoretical studies of spin-dependent electrical transport through carbon nanotbes\n\n14\n\ndisorder may really mimic behavior of multiwall CNTs. Putting it in other words, the\npresent results give credit to the wide spread view that MWCNT transport properties\ncan be regarded just as due to its outermost shell disturbed electrostatically by inner\nshells (assuming that the latter are out of contact to the leads).\nAs regards the influence of a magnetic field, it has been shown here that interface\nconditions, responsible for energy level widths and the charge transfer, modify the\nmagnetoconductance spectra for parallel orientation without changing the period of the\nAharonov-Bohm oscillations. In particular, if the charge transfer shifted EF happens to\ntouch the closest energy-gap edge (considerably broadened by the strong coupling to the\nelectrodes) then the conductance of armchair CNTs remains finite even at \u03a6 = \u03a60 /2.\nFor the same reason nominally semiconducting CNTs may have suppressed but finite\nconductance at \u03a6 = 0 and \u03a60 . Moreover the conductance reveals two- and three-peak\nstructures which have been interpreted here as being reminiscent features of the AjikiAndo theory when either a large energy-level broadening or a high doping come into\nplay. It is noteworthy that SWCNTs lose their ability to serve as magneto-electrical\nswitches when their length-to-perimeter ratio approaches unity.\nThe magnetoconductance spectra of CNTs at a perpendicular field, in turn, reveal\npronounced oscillations having a pseudo-period which scales with a CNT radius. It\nhas been found that in the (quasi) ballistic regime the magnetoresistance changes its\nsign at fields related to the onset of the first Landau level. A clear dying down of\nmagnetoconduction oscillations at the charge neutrality point (of the extended molecule)\nwith the increasing magnetic field is due to narrowing of the lowest Landau level-width.\nAcknowledgments\nI thank the EU grant CARDEQ under contract IST-021285-2, and the Pozna\u0144\nSupercomputing and Networking Center for the computing time.\nReferences\n[1] Baibich M N, Broto J M, Fert A, Nguyen Van Dau F, Petroff F, Eitenne P, Creuzet G, Friederich\nA and Chazelas J 1988 Phys.
