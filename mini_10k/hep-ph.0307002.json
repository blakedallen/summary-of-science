Particularly I will discuss how supergravity effects lift the flat\ndirection potential and leads to interesting cosmological consequences.\n\n1\n\nSupergravity & cosmology\n\nLike particle physics cosmology also confronts hierarchical scales; e.g. Planck\nscale Mp = 2.436 \u00d7 1018 GeV, and big bang nucleosynthesis scale TBBN \u223c\n1 MeV, and uncertainties. Unfortunately there is no direct evidence of thermal history of the Universe beyond T \u223c 1 MeV. Though there are indirect\nevidences which when tied up with particle physics makes a strong case that\nthermal history could go way beyond the nucleosynthesis scale to the grand\nunification scale T \u2264 \u03b12 Mp \u223c 1016 GeV, where \u03b1 \u223c 10\u22122 is the gauge coupling constant. Note that beyond the grand unification scale it might be hard\nto keep the Universe in a thermal equilibrium due to lack of understanding of\ninteractions and strong dynamics which could prevail. In this respect supergravity (SUGRA) 1 plays an important role in constraining thermal history\nof the early Universe, see 2 .\nThe superpartner of graviton is a spin 3/2 gravitino with helicity states\n\u00b13/2, \u00b1 1/2. The latter one is mainly the goldstino mode which is eaten by\nthe super-Higgs mechanism 3 when supersymmetry is spontaneously broken.\nTypically N = 1 supersymmetry (SUSY) is broken in a hidden sector by some\nnon-perturbative dynamics, e.g. gaugino condensation 1 . SUSY breaking is\nthen mediated via gravitational (or possibly other) couplings to the observable sector in such a way that sfermions and gauginos get masses of order\nelectroweak scale 4,1 . In addition, the gravitino also gets a mass, which in\nthe simplest gravity mediated models is of order O(100) GeV.\nAlthough gravitino interactions with matter are suppressed by the Planck\nmass, they can be generated in great abundances very close to the Planck\nscale 5 . Inflation would dilute their number density, but during reheating\nthey would be regenerated though scattering of gauge and gaugino quanta,\nwith adverse consequences 6 . Thermal regeneration of gravitino abundance\nis harmless for BBN (gravitino decay products can enhance the abundance of\nD +3 He due to photo fission of 4 He), provided the reheat temperature of the\nUniverse is Trh \u2264 (107 \u2212 1010 ) GeV, for a range of gravitino mass 100 GeV \u2264\nm3/2 \u2264 10 TeV 7,8 . Gravitinos could also be produced by non-perturbative\nprocesses during inflaton oscillations 9 . Note that expanding Universe breaks\nsupersymmetry and normally the scale is set by the Hubble expansion, which\n1\n\n\fcould be larger than the hidden sector supersymmetry breaking.\nIt is this early Universe supersymmetry breaking scale plays interesting\nrole. SUGRA plays a very important role in higher dimensions motivated by\nsuperstring theory. In this respect cosmological evolution of dilaton and moduli is an important issue which has to be dealt separately. However recently\ndynamics of dilaton and moduli has been addressed in presence of Ramond\nRamond fluxes 10 . Inflationary scenarios 11 have also been proposed where\nN = 1, 11 dimensional SUGRA model is squashed on a seven sphere. The resulting potentials turn out\nof multi-field exponential\nP to be some combination\nP\npotentials of type c1 exp \u03b1i \u03c6i + c2 exp \u03b2i \u03c8i + ...\nIn this talk we will not concentrate on finding inflationary solutions, but\nwe will describe the dynamics of the flat directions within minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM). Flat directions is a property of any SUSY\ntheory and here we will argue how interesting cosmology arises when we take\ninto account of SUGRA effects.\n2\n\nStatus of outstanding issues in cosmology\n\nBefore we discuss flat directions let us give a brief overview of the present status of cosmological issues. The recent W-MAP data has provided the precision\nmeasurement of cosmological parameters, e.g. Hubble expansion, fluctuations\nin the temperature, perturbation spectrum and its slope, running spectral index, etc 12 , all suggest that perhaps an era of inflation might have occurred.\nDespite these observational successes, inflaton sector is still eluding. There\nare many plausible models which can provide more or less correct features\nbut none of them are well motivated from particle physics. The main reason\nis that inflaton is always treated as a SM gauge singlet. This leads to a wild\nspeculation of inflaton coupling to the SM fields and the scale of inflation\nranging from 1013 \u2264 H \u2264 103 GeV. Extremely low scale inflation model is\npossible to construct if the string scale is as low as TeV, e.g., 13 , for a TeV\nscale inflation number of e-foldings required for galaxy formation is as low as\n43.\nBaryogenesis is an indirect evidence of cosmology and particle physics\nbeyond the Higgs scale, because baryon asymmetry of order one part in 1010\nis sought for the synthesis of light elements at T \u223c 1 MeV. Within SM it\nis possible to satisfy all three criteria for baryogenesis, e.g. baryon number\nviolating processes (due to accidental B + L violation arising from the SM\nsphalerons), C and CP violation, and out of equilibrium condition. Inspite\nof all the necessary ingredients within SM baryogenesis is ruled out because\nthere is not enough strong first order phase transition (success of baryogenesis\nrequires Higgs mass to be mH \u2264 72 GeV 14 , which is already ruled out by the\nLEP data, see 15 ). Within MSSM there is a slim hope because the parameter\nspace for Higgs is 110 GeV \u2264 mH \u2264 115 GeV, and the lightest stop to be\n2\n\n\flighter than the top quark mass 105 GeV \u2264 mt\u0303R \u2264 165 GeV 16 .\nThere are other baryogenesis schemes such as thermal leptogenesis in\nmodels where right handed neutrino mass appears naturally 17 , or nonthermal leptogenesis 18 . However thermal leptogenesis within SO(10) requires generally large reheat temperature Trh \u2265 1010 , which is generically\nconsidered to be tight given the gravitino overproduction constraints. One\nmight resort for non-thermal leptogenesis scenarios, but unfortunately they\nbear the uncertainties of reheat temperature of the Universe. Though they\ncould be tested from CMB experiments 19 . In this respect MSSM flat directions can act as a savior 21,22 , because a generic flat direction carries global\nU (1) baryon and/or lepton number which can be broken due to soft A-terms,\nwhich we will discuss briefly, for details see 2 .\nOther important issues are the cold dark matter generation which comprise 30% of the total energy density, and the cosmological constant which\nhas the largest share of 70% at the present moment. The cold dark matter\nis well served by supersymmetric candidate neutralino (We have had many\ntalks on this issue in this conference, see 20 ). The cosmological constant is a\nreal issue for which we have NO understanding. The major problem is why\nthe cosmological constant is so small, and why it is dominating now. There\nare some resolution of the smallness and why now for cosmological constant\nin terms of non-perturbative \u03b8-vacuum, see 23 .\n3\n\nA brief review of MSSM flat directions\n\nAt the level of renormalizable terms, SUSY field theories generically have\ninfinitely degenerate vacua. This is a consequence of SUSY and gauge symmetries (and discrete symmetries such as R-parity) of the Lagrangian. Therefore, in general there are a number of directions in the space of scalar fields,\ncollectively called the moduli space, where the scalar potential is identically\nzero. In low energy SUSY theories such classical degeneracy is accidental and\nis protected from perturbative quantum corrections by a non-renormalization\ntheorem 24 . In principle the degeneracies could be lifted by non-perturbative\neffects. However such effects are likely to be suppressed exponentially and\nthus unimportant because all the couplings of low energy theories are typically weak even at relatively large vevs. Therefore in a SUSY limit when\nMp \u2192 \u221e, the potential for the flat direction always vanishes.\nHowever there is an effective potential for the flat direction arises as a\nresult of SUSY breaking terms and higher dimensional operators in the superpotential. In this sense MSSM flat directions are only approximately flat\nat vevs larger than the SUSY breaking scale.\nThe SUSY scalar potential V is the sum of the F- and D-terms and reads\nX\n\u2202WMSSM\n1X 2 a a\n, Da = \u03c6i \u2020 T a \u03c6i . (1)\nga D D , Fi \u2261\n|Fi |2 +\nV =\n2\n\u2202\u03c6\ni\na\ni\n3\n\n\fHere we have assumed that \u03c6i transforms under a gauge group G with the\ngenerators of the Lie algebra given by T a .\nAn example of a D-and F-flat direction is provided by LHu .\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1\n0\n\u03c6\nHu = \u221a\n, L= \u221a\n,\n(2)\n\u03c6\n2\n2 0\nWe can denote \u03c6 as a complex field parameterizing the flat direction, or the\norder parameter, or the AD field. All the other fields are set to zero. In terms\nof the composite gauge invariant operators, we would write Xm = LHu (m =\n2).\n\u2217\nFrom Eq. 2 one clearly obtains FH\n= \u03bbu Q\u016b + \u03bcHd = FL\u2217 = \u03bbd Hd \u0113 \u2261 0\nu\n\u2217\nfor all \u03c6. However there exists a non-zero F-component given by FH\n= \u03bcHu .\nd\nSince \u03bc can not be much larger than the electroweak scale MW \u223c O(1) TeV,\nthis contribution is of the same order as the soft supersymmetry breaking\nmasses, which are going to lift the degeneracy. Therefore, following 22 , one\nmay nevertheless consider LHu to correspond to a F-flat direction.\na\nThe relevant D-terms read DSU(2)\n= Hu\u2020 \u03c43 Hu +L\u2020 \u03c43 L = 12 |\u03c6|2 \u2212 21 |\u03c6|2 \u2261 0.\nTherefore LHu direction is also D-flat. All the MSSM flat directions are listed\nin 25 following 26 .\n4\n\nLifting flat directions\n\nVacuum degeneracy along a flat direction can be broken in two ways: by\nsupersymmetry breaking, or by higher order non-renormalizable operators\nappearing in the effective low energy theory.\nA particular class of non-renormalizable interaction terms induced by the\ninflaton arise for a K\u00e4hler potential which has a form 27,22,28 , and which\ngenerates terms like\nZ\n\u03c1I\n1\n(3)\nK = d4 \u03b8 2 (I \u2020 I)(\u03c6\u2020 \u03c6) , L = 2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 = 3HI2 \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6 ,\nMP\nMP\nR\nwhere I is the inflaton whose energy density \u03c1 \u2248 h d4 \u03b8I \u2020 Ii dominates during\ninflation, and \u03c6 is the flat direction. In the above HI is the Hubble parameter\nduring inflation. In addition, there are also inflaton-induced supergravity\ncorrections to the flat direction. By inspecting N = 1 supergravity potential,\none finds the following terms like\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c6\nFI\u2217 FI\nV (\u03c6) = H 2 MP2 f\nH2 .\n(4)\n, m2\u03c6 = 2 +\nMP\nVF (I) + VD (I)\nwhere f is some function, and the effective mass for inflaton is written for a\nminimal choice of flat direction K\u00e4hler potential K(\u03c6\u2020 , \u03c6) = \u03c6\u2020 \u03c6.\nIn purely D-term inflation 29 there is no Hubble induced mass correction\nto the flat direction during inflation because FI = 0. However, when D-term\ninflation ends, the energy density stored in the D-term is converted to an\n4\n\n\fF-term and to kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus again a mass term m2\u03c6 =\n\u00b1O(1)H 2 appears naturally, however the overall sign is undetermined 30 . For\n\nnon-flat K\u00e4hler potential such as in no-scale models K \u223c ln(z + z \u2217 + \u03c6\u2020i \u03c6),\nwhere z belongs to supersymmetry breaking sector, and \u03c6i belongs to the\nmatter sector, and both are measured in terms of reduced Planck mass (for a\nreview, see 31 the mass term for the flat direction in presence of inflationary\npotential turns out to be m2\u03c6 \u223c 10\u22122 HI2 27,32.\nBesides supergravity correction the flat directions can be lifted by the\nnon-renormalizable contributions such as 22\nh\nh\n|\u03bb|2\n\u03c6d , W = d\u22123 \u03c8\u03c6d\u22121 , and V (\u03c6) = 2d\u22126 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03c6)d\u22121 . (5)\nd\u22123\ndM\nM\nM\nwhere the dimensionality of the effective scalar operator is d, and h is a coupling constant which could be complex with |h| \u223c O(1). Here M is some\nlarge mass, typically of the order of the Planck mass or the string scale (in\nthe heterotic case M \u223c MGUT ).\nVacuum degeneracy will also be lifted by supersymmetry breaking. It is\ninduced by the soft terms, which in the simplest case read\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03bbA\u03c6d\n2\n2\n+ h.c. ,\n(6)\nV (\u03c6) = m0 |\u03c6| +\ndM d\u22123\nW =\n\nwhere SUSY breaking mass m0 and A are typically of the order of the gravitino\nmass m3/2 . An additional soft source for SUSY breaking are the gaugino\nmasses mg . The A-term in Eq. (6) violates the U (1) carried by the flat\ndirection and thus provides the necessary source for B \u2212 L violation in AD\nbaryogenesis. In general, the coupling \u03bb is complex and has an associated\nphase \u03b8\u03bb . Writing \u03c6 = |\u03c6| exp(i\u03b8), one obtains a potential proportional to\ncos(\u03b8\u03bb + n\u03b8) in the angular direction. This has n discrete minima for the\nphase of \u03c6, at each of which U (1) is broken.\n5\n5.1\n\nThe potential for flat direction\nF -term inflation\n\nLet us collect all the terms which contribute to the flat direction potential,\nwhich in the case of F-term inflation can be written as 22\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c6d\n2\n2\nV (\u03c6) = \u2212CI HI2 |\u03c6| + a\u03bbd H\n+\nh.c.\n+ m2\u03c6 |\u03c6|\ndM d\u22123\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|\u03c6|2d\u22122\n\u03c6d\n+\nh.c.\n+ |\u03bb|2 2d\u22126 .\n(7)\n+ A\u03c6 \u03bbd\nd\u22123\ndM\nM\nThe first and the third terms are the Hubble-induced and low-energy soft mass\nterms, respectively, while the second and the fourth terms are the Hubbleinduced and low-energy A terms. The last term is the contribution from the\n5\n\n\fnon-renormalizable superpotential. The coefficients |CI |, a, \u03bbd \u223c O(1), and\nthe coupling \u03bb \u2248 1/(d \u2212 1)!. Note that low-energy A\u03c6 term is dimensionful.\nNote here the importance of the relative sign of the coefficient CI . At large\nfield values the first term dictates the dynamics of the AD field. If CI < 0 , the\nabsolute minimum of the potential is \u03c6 = 0 and during inflation the AD field\nwill settle down to the bottom of the potential roughly in one Hubble time.\nIn such a case the AD field will not have any interesting classical dynamics.\nIts presence will nevertheless be felt because of quantum fluctuations. These\nwill be chi-squared in nature since then the classical energy density of the AD\nfield would be due to its own fluctuations.\nIf CI \u226a 1, the AD field takes some time to reach the bottom of the\npotential, and if it has a non-zero amplitude after the end of inflation, its\ndynamics is non-trivial.\nThe most interesting scenario occurs when CI > 0. In this case the\nabsolute value of the AD field settles during inflation to the minimum given\nby\n|\u03c6| \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\nCI\nHI M d\u22123\n(d \u2212 1)\u03bbd\n\n\u00131/d\u22122\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nHere we have ignored the potential term \u221d a; if CI > 0, the a-term will not\nchange the vev qualitatively. On the other hand, even for CI < 0 the potential\nEq. (7) will have a minimum with a non vanishing vev if |a|2 > 4(d \u2212 1)CI .\nHowever the origin will also be a minimum in this case. The dynamics then\ndepends on which minimum the AD field will choose during inflation.\nThe a-term in Eq. (7) violates the global U (1) symmetry carried by \u03c6. If\n|a| is O(1), the phase \u03b8 of h\u03c6i is related to the phase of a through n\u03b8 + \u03b8a = \u03c0;\notherwise \u03b8 will take some random value, which will generally be of O(1). This\nis the initial CP -violation which is required for baryogenesis/leptogenesis. In\npractice, the superpotential term lifting the flat direction is also the B and\nCP violating operator responsible for AD baryogenesis, inducing a baryon\nasymmetry in the coherently oscillating \u03c6 condensate.\n5.2\n\nD-term inflation\n\nIn D-term inflation one does not get the Hubble induced mass correction to\nthe flat direction so that CI = 0. Also the Hubble induced a-term is absent.\nHowever the Hubble induced mass correction eventually dominates once Dterm induced inflation comes to an end. The potential for a generic flat\ndirection during D-term inflation is given by\nV (\u03c6) =\n\n2\nm2\u03c6 |\u03c6|\n\n\u0012\n+ A\u03c6 \u03bbd\n\n\u0013\n2d\u22122\n\u03c6d\n2 |\u03c6|\n+\nh.c.\n+\n|\u03bb|\n,\ndM d\u22123\nM 2d\u22126\n6\n\n(9)\n\n\fand after the end of inflation the flat direction potential is given by 30\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2d\u22122\n\u0001 2\n\u03c6d\n2\n2\n2 |\u03c6|\nV (\u03c6) = m\u03c6 \u2212 CH |\u03c6| + A\u03c6 \u03bbd\n+\nh.c.\n+\n|\u03bb|\n,\n(10)\ndM d\u22123\nM 2d\u22126\n\nwhere C \u223c O(1). For C positive, the flat\np direction settles down to one of its\nminima given by Eq. (8) provided \u03c6 \u2265 m\u03c6 M/\u03bb, otherwise\n\u00131/d\u22122\n\u0012\n2C\nH(t)2 M d\u22123\n,\n(11)\n|\u03c6| \u2243\n\u03bbd A\u03bb (d \u2212 1)\n\nNote that in this case that the A-term is also responsible for B and/or L, and\nCP violation. Another generic point to remember is that in R-parity conserving models the B and/or L violating operators must have even dimensions,\nso that d = 4 yields the minimal operator for AD baryogenesis.\n6\n\nVarious applications of MSSM flat directions in cosmology\n\nHere we briefly recall important application of MSSM flat directions in the\nearly Universe, and then in the subsequent subsection we will concentrate on\nhow MSSM flat directions can generate observed density fluctuations in the\nUniverse.\n(1) Can MSSM flat directions lead to inflation ?\nAt sufficiently large vevs the non-renormalizable potential \u03bb2 |\u03c6|2d\u22122 /M 2d\u22126\ndominates over all the contributions, provided there is Hubble induced correction. Nevertheless the vev of the flat direction never exceeds Mp required\nfor a successful inflation in this case. However one might expect assisted inflation 11 with the help of 300 flat directions within MSSM. Though the yield\nof number of e-foldings is much less than 55, required to make the Universe\nflat and homogeneous.\n(2) Can MSSM flat direction gives rise to density perturbations ?\nFor D-term inflation MSSM flat directions evolve in the non-renormalizable\npotential and feel the quantum fluctuations \u03b4\u03c6 \u223c HI /2\u03c0, This is a good news\nbecause now we may be able to generate the observed density perturbations\nfrom the MSSM flat direction, instead from the inflaton sector whose potential\nwe may never be able to construct with full confidence. Besides the MSSM flat\ndirection potential is more constrained than some unknown inflaton sectors 33 .\n(3) Can MSSM flat direction gives rise to baryogenesis ?\nYes, the flat direction carries global U(1) charge. For LHu it is B \u2212 L. Note\nthat global U (1) is broken only by the A-terms. This provides an ideal condition for CP violation (dynamically), which leads to helical motion on the field\nspace. As a flat direction rotates, it generates the asymmetry. The final leptonic asymmetry is created when LHu direction completely evaporates. One\nmust take into account of thermal corrections: \u221d T 2 |\u03c6|2 and T 4 ln(|\u03c62 /M 2 |).\nOne can further make connection with the light neutrino masses and leptogenesis from the sliding vev of LHu flat direction. It turns out that the lightest\n7\n\n\fleft handed neutrino mass to be very small around 10\u22128 eV 34 . Recent analysis shows that it is possible to obtain the right baryon asymmetry of order\none part in 1010 .\n(4) Do MSSM flat directions run ?\nOne has to consider the running of the soft terms for the MSSM flat directions,\ne.g. m2\u03c6 |\u03c6|2 term. Running of the MSSM flat direction during inflation has\nbeen considered in Ref. 35 . It was concluded that LH flat direction is a likely\nu\n\ncandidate whose mass2 running remain positive during inflation irrespective\nof the sign of CI . Post-inflationary running can give rise to interesting effects\ndepending on low energy supersymmetry breaking schemes, e.g. gravity, or\ngauge mediation. The potentials for both gravity and gauge mediation can\nbe written, respectively as 36,37,38\n!\n\u0012\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0013\n2\n2(d\u22121)\nd\n\u03bb\n|\u03a6|\nA\n\u03bb\u03a6\n|\u03a6|\n\u03bb\n|\u03a6|2 +\n+ h.c.\n+\nU (\u03a6) = m2\u03c6 1 + K log\n2(d\u22123)\nM2\ndMPd\u22123\nMP\n!\n!\n\u03bb2 |\u03a6|2(d\u22121)\nA\u03bb \u03bb\u03a6d\n|\u03a6|2\n4\n+ h.c. .\n(12)\n+\nU (\u03a6) = m\u03c6 log 1 + 2 +\n2(d\u22123)\nm\u03c6\ndMPd\u22123\nMP\nwhere m\u03c6 \u2248 100 GeV for gravity mediated SUSY breaking, while m\u03c6 \u223c\n1\u2212100 TeV in the case of gauge mediation. K is a parameter which depends on\nthe flat direction, and the logarithmic contribution parameterizes the running\nof the flat direction potential with M = (MPd\u22123 m3/2 /|\u03bb|)(1/d\u22122) . In the gravity\nmediated case |A\u03bb | < dm3/2 , for gauge mediation |A\u03bb | \u2264 (10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22127 )m\u03c6 ,\nfor d = 4, 6 39 . For the squark directions the value of K tends to become\nnegative and this has interesting consequences 40 .\n(5) What is the fate of the flat direction ?\nThe post inflationary running of the MSSM flat direction plays an important\nrole. The flat direction starts oscillating at the SUSY breaking scale under\nthe influence of potentials Eqs. (12) depending on whether SUSY is broken\nvia gravity mediation or gauge mediation. For a negative values of |K| < 0,\nthe leading potential term in gravity mediation case is \u223c |\u03c6|2\u22122K shallower\nthan the \u03c62 . The oscillations in such a potential on average gives rise to a\nnegative pressure which fragments the flat direction 40 . The linear fluctuations grow non-linearly and form non-topological solitons, known as B-balls.\nThe B-balls carry baryon number \u223c 1017 \u2212 1018 36,37 , and release them via\nsurface evaporation, which takes place usually after the electro-weak scale.\nFor every baryon number there are 3 LSP (which is bino in the case of minimal SUGRA). Therefore MSSM flat direction is the only mechanism which\ncan connect baryon number and cold dark matter abundance within an order\nof magnitude. It turns out that binos are over produced and therefore not\nhailed as a good candidate for CDM. However it opens the door for Higgsino\nand/or Wino to be the right candidate 41 . The Q-balls are also formed in\ngauge mediation, though in this case mass per unit charge of a Q ball can be\n8\n\n\fless than the nucleon mass 42 (for numerical simulation see 43 ). Therefore\nrendering such Q balls absolutely stable under surface evaporation. These\nQ-balls act as a potential candidate for CDM with Q \u2265 1012 . Various indirect\nsearches for dark matter experiment put constraints on the charge of stable\nQ balls, which is right now Q \u2265 1022 44 .\nThe above mentioned applications exhibit how rich MSSM flat directions\nare for the early Universe cosmology. This is the most economical approach\nin obtaining a meaningful early Universe in conjunction with supersymmetry.\nIn the remaining talk I will concentrate upon very new development on how\nMSSM flat directions can help generating scale invariant adiabatic density\nfluctuations.\n7\n\nMagic without Magic: generating adiabatic fluctuations\n\nAt the time of last scattering surface the perturbations in photons, baryons\nand CDM can be characterized by an overall curvature perturbation R, and\na relative isocurvature component S in the different matter components\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4\u03c1\n\u03b4\u03c1i\n\u03b4\u03c1\u03b3\nR = H , S = 3H\n.\n(13)\n\u2212\n\u03c1\u0307\n\u03c1\u0307\n\u03c1\u0307i\nIn a pure adiabatic case S = 0. But in general R and S could be correlated. An important point to realize that entropy perturbations seed adiabatic\nperturbations on large scales. This is the key for MSSM flat directions to succeed as a candidate for generating scale invariant fluctuations. The question\narises if there are roughly 300 flat directions present during the inflationary\nepoch then what do they do?. As explained earlier inflaton sector need not\ntake the burden of explaining the density fluctuations. There could be MSSM\nflat directions pioneering this role of generating perturbations. There are two\npopular schemes which I briefly sketch in this talk.\n(1) Curvaton scenario:\nQuantum fluctuations of the MSSM flat direction during inflation give rise\nto isocurvature perturbations. To comply with CMB measurements, these\nperturbations have to be converted into adiabatic ones 45,46,47 . Such a conversion takes place when the contribution of the curvaton energy density \u03c1\u03c6\nto the total energy density in the universe grows, i.e., with the increase of\nr=\n\n3\u03c1\u03c6\n.\n4\u03c1\u03b3 + 3\u03c1\u03c6\n\n(14)\n\nHere \u03c1\u03b3 is the energy in the radiation bath from inflaton decay (a hidden\nsector inflaton reheats into hidden sector relativistic degrees of freedom). NonGaussianity of the produced adiabatic perturbations requires the MSSM flat\ndirection to contribute more than 1% to the energy density of the universe at\nthe time of decay, that is rdec > 0.01 45,46,12 . Flat directions which are lifted\n9\n\n\fonly by d = 7, 9 are appropriate for this scenario 33 (see Eq. (9) for D-term\ninflation).\n(2) Fluctuating inflaton coupling:\nIn a supersymmetric context the inflaton can decay into MSSM degrees of\nfreedom via vev dependent couplings\nqc\nh\nq\n(15)\nW \u220b \u03bbh I H\u0304H + I qq + I qc qc + I qqc ,\nM\nM\nM\nwhere I is the inflaton, H and H\u0304 are the two Higgs doublets, and q and qc are\n(s)quarks and (s)lepton superfields and their anti-particles. M is the cut-off\nscale. Fluctuations in \u03b4\u03c1\u03b3 /\u03c1\u03b3 = \u2212(2/3)\u03b4\u0393/\u0393 48,49,19 . The factor 2/3 appears\ndue to red-shift of the modes during the decay of the inflaton whose energy\nstill dominates. The inflaton decay rate is \u0393 = 1/(4\u03c0)mI \u03bb2 . The decay rate\nfluctuates if either \u03bb or mI is a function of a fluctuating light field.\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(\n\u03c6\n\u03bb0 1 + M\n+ ... ,\ndirect decay.\n(16)\n\u03bb=\n\u03c6\nindirect decay.\n\u03bb0 M ,\nIn the MSSM example, the \"direct\" decay mode corresponds into inflaton\ndecay into Higgs fields, whereas the \"indirect\" decay mode corresponds to\ndecay into quarks and anti-squarks. The fluctuation in the decay rate for\nthese cases is\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4 2 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\ndirect decay.\n\u03b4\u0393 \uf8f2 M\n,\nindirect decay.\n2 \u03b4\u03c6\n=\n(17)\n\u03c6\n\uf8f4\n\u0393\n\uf8f3 \u03b4\u03c6 ,\nfluctuating\nmass.\n\u03c6\nAgain fluctuations in MSSM flat direction generates isocurvature fluctuations\nwhich is then transferred to adiabatic fluctuations of the relativistic species\nat the time of reheating 48,50 .\n\n8\n\nConclusion\n\nMSSM along with SUGRA plays multi-faceted role in the early Universe. If\nSUSY is the answer for the desert between the electroweak and the Planck\nscale, then MSSM flat directions certainly provide an unique set up where\nquestions ranging from density fluctuations to baryon asymmetry and cold\ndark matter generation can be addressed in a most economical way. This is\na great triumph for SUSY and SUGRA that it can not only tame particle\nphysics domain but can also conquer cosmology.\nReferences\n1. H. P. Nilles, Phys. Rept. 110, 1 (1984).\n2. K.
