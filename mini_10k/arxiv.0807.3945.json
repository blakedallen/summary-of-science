Introduction\nDouble wells, either symmetric or asymmetric appear on solving for electron-tunneling\nproblems and/or classical transitions from one phonon-coupled electronic state to another\nstate, in particular those pertaining to reaction rates [1]. Although certain approximations have\nbeen applied to obtaining energy eigenvalues, such as the quasiclassical (QCA) and adiabatic\n(AA) approximations, no exact solutions have been available. Nevertheless, the double-well\nmethod has been found fruitful for calculating the rate of a chemical reaction [2]. Some time\nago, Keung, Kovacs and Sukhatme [3] obtained convincing results which dealt with\nsymmetric double wells followed by a subsequent work by Gangopadhyaya, Panigrahi and\nSukhatme et al. [4] on the asymmetric double wells, both from the viewpoint of susy quantum\nmechanics. There are several conceivable types, such as bottom-depth asymmetry (bda) and\nbottom-curvature asymmetry (bca). It is a matter of common belief that susy provides a\npowerful circumventing method for solving Schr\u00f6dinger's equation in cases where the direct\napproach is less productive [5]. The calculated eigenvalue differences (tunneling splittings,\nzero-point reaction heats, etc.) between the component potentials of an asymmetric double\nwell have been found comparable with those obtained by QCA, as well as with the numerical\nsolution of Schr\u00f6dinger's double-well equation (two site problem).\nIt is to be pointed out that while symmetric double wells in two-site problems apply to\nprocesses such as impurity dipole reorientation or polaron motion, asymmetric double valleys\naccount for the rate of chemical reactions [1].\nNevertheless, no comparison has been made with AA which is often used in symmetric and\nasymmetric situations as the main approach most often involving first or second-order\nperturbation a la Rayleigh-Schr\u00f6dinger. In turn, this paper is aimed at providing the missing\ninformation in order to see how it compares with the susy method which involves perturbative\napproaches too, albeit based on a different (logarithmic) method [4].\n2. Susy approach to isolated double wells\n\n\fTo begin with, we outline the basic premises of susy quantum mechanics (susy-qm) which\nmay not be outright familiar for most of the readers. Susy-qm is intended to describing\nsuperpartners and in order to obtain solutions for one of the pair components one has to take\nan operator square root of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation of a pair. This is being done in the\nfollowing way using operator techniques: If V\u2212(x) is the relevant potential of the problem,\nthen susy allows one to construct a \"partner potential\" V+(x) with eigenvalues in 1-to-1\ncorrespondence with the excited-state eigenvalues of V\u2212(x), that is, E\u2212n = E+n-1 for any integer\nn. It does not include n=0, the V\u2212(x) ground state, which has no paired correspondent on\nV+(x). The situation is typical for an asymmetric double well where the right-hand deeper\ncomponent has one bound state below all the bound states on the left-hand shallower\ncomponent.\nIt is customary to describe V\u2212(x) in terms of its ground-state wave function. We assume that\nthe wave function is known and that its corresponding eigenvalue is vanishing (h=2m=1):\nH\u2212 \u03c80(x) \u2261 [\u2212d2/dx2 + V\u2212(x)] \u03c80(x) = 0\n\n(1)\n\nIn terms of the ground state H\u2212 is also represented as:\nH\u2212 = \u2212d2/dx2 + (\u03c80\u2032\u2032/\u03c80 )\n\n(2)\n\nWe introduce two operators: A = d/dx \u2212 (\u03c80\u2032/\u03c80 ), A\u2020 = \u2212 d/dx \u2212 (\u03c80'/\u03c80 ) to obtain H\u2212 \u2261 A\u2020A.\nAnother semidefinite Hermitian operator is defined as\nH+ \u2261 AA\u2020 = \u2212 d2/dx2 + V+(x)\n\n(3)\n\nV+(x) = V\u2212(x) \u2013 2 d/dx (\u03c80'/\u03c80 ) = \u2212 V\u2212(x) + 2 (\u03c80\u2032/\u03c80 )2\n\n(4)\n\nAt this stage, we introduce the superpotential\nW(x) = \u2212 (\u03c80'/\u03c80 )\n\n(5)\n\nby means of which A and A\u2020 are given by\nA = d/dx + W(x), A\u2020 = \u2212 d/dx + W(x)\n\n(6)\n\nwhile\nV\u00b1(x) = W(x)2 \u00b1 W'(x)\n\n(7)\n\nand the commutator [A,A\u2020] = 2W'(x).\nShowing explicitly the E\u2212n = E+n-1 correspondence, H+(A\u03c8n(\u2212)) = AA\u2020 (A\u03c8n(\u2212)) = A(A\u2020A\u03c8n(\u2212))\n= AH\u2212(\u03c8n(\u2212) ) = E\u2212n (A\u03c8n(\u2212)).\nWe further reproduce what has been obtained [3] by the susy equations for the symmetric case\nusing the ground-state trial wave function\n\n\f\u03c80(x) = exp(-[x+x0]2) + exp(-[x-x0]2):\n\n(8)\n\nW(x) = 2[x \u2013 x0tanh(2xx0)]\n\n(9)\n\nV\u00b1(x) = 4[x \u2013 x0tanh(2xx0)]2 \u00b1 2[1 \u2013 2x02sech2(2xx0)]\n\n(10)\n\nfor the super- and partner- potentials, respectively. The potentials V\u2212(x), V+(x), and W(x) for\nsymmetric wells as they occur in supersymmetry problems are shown in Figures 1(a) and (b).\nFinally we reproduce the results on supersymmetry potentials of asymmetric wells (a \u2260 1), as\nfollows:\nW(x) = {\u22122a(x-x0)exp(-a[x-x0]2)+2(x+x0)exp(-[x+x0]2}/{exp(-[x+x0]2) +exp(-a[x-x0]2)}(11)\nV\u00b1(x) = W(x)2 \u00b1 W'(x)\n\n(12)\n\nHere a is the asymmetry parameter a = 1 for symmetric wells, a < 1 for asymmetric ones. The\nsuperpotentials W(x) for both symmetries (a=1 and a=0.4) are compared in Figure 2. The\nform of the trial double-well eigenstate for the bca supersymmetry problem is:\n\u03c80(x) = exp(\u2212a[x\u2212x0]2) + exp(\u2212[x+x0]2).\n\n(13)\n\nSusypotentials W (solid), V- (dotted)\n\n\u03be0=2.5\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n-3,0\n\n-2,5\n\n-2,0\n\n-1,5\n\n-1,0\n\n-0,5\n\n0,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,0\n\n1,5\n\n2,0\n\n2,5\n\n3,0\n\nCoordinate \u03be\n\nFigure 1(a): Partner potential V\u2212(\u03be) and superpotential W(\u03be) in susy quantum mechanics, as\ncalculated for isolated symmetric double wells using the equations in Section 2.

Adiabatic approximation\n3.1. Symmetric wells pertaining to off-center polarons\nWe proceed to considering a specific example of phonon-coupled species to which most of\nour arguments apply rigorously: the off-center or vibronic polarons in solids.\nOff-center displacements often appear in crystals as electronic charge carriers couple to\ncentrosymmetric configurations which results in the breaking of their inversion symmetry.\nPairs of lower-symmetry conformations appear, each pair producing two equal in magnitude\nand opposite in sign electric dipoles. These twin conformations are equivalent physically and\ntunneling transitions between them smear out the overall dipole thus restoring on the average\nthe original inversion symmetry. Yet, the species are still polarizable in an electric field as is\nan s-wave atom. Consequently, nearby entities may be expected to pair via the analogue of the\natomic Van der Waals forces in which the polarizability should incorporate the vibronic effect\nleading to the off-center instability. In this way off-center defects in crystals are expected to\nbind to each other to form dimers or larger aggregates \u2013 precursors to new phase formation. In\nthe adiabatic approximation the above physics is described by double-well potentials which\naccounts for the overall importance ascribed in Section 2 to double-well processes.\nThroughout this study we assume that the driving force of an off-center instability is the band\npseudo-Jahn-Teller effect [6-8]. Accordingly we consider the following Hamiltonian:\nH = \u03a3i,\u03b2 Ei\u03b2 ai\u03b2\u2020 ai\u03b2 + \u03a3i 1\u20442 Ki qi2 + \u03a3 i Gi qi (ai1\u2020 ai2 + ai2\u2020 ai1) + TN\n\n(14)\n\nHere subscript \"i\" runs over the on-center sites hosting the vibronic polarons, while \"\u03b2\" labels\ntwo nearly degenerate opposite parity electron bands (\u03b2=1,2). qi, Ki, and Gi are the\n\n\fcoordinates, spring and coupling constants, respectively, of the mixing (odd) vibrational\nmode, ai\u03b2\u2020 , etc. are electron ladder operators. TN is the lattice kinetic energy operator.\nTo adiabatic approximation the electronic subproblem in (12) is dealt with by neglecting TN\nand regarding the nuclear coordinates qi as c-number parameters. After solving for the\nelectronic subproblem, the obtained (adiabatic) electronic energy EL(qi) is regarded as\nvibronic energy for dealing with the nuclear subproblem setting Hvib = TN + EL(qi). This\nprogram is to be implemented in greater detail below.\nUsing the adiabatic Hamiltonian HAD = H \u2013 TN we solve Schrodinger's equation HAD\u03c8 = E\u03c8\nby a superposition of one-particle electronic states in either electron band: \u03c8 = \u03a3i\u03b2 ci\u03b2 ai\u03b2\u2020 |0\u3009.\nA corresponding secular equation obtains for E whose roots are:\nEU/L (qi) = 1\u20442 Kiqi2 \u00b1 1\u20442 \u221a [4Gi2 qi2 + (Ei2 \u2013 Ei1)2]\n\n(15)\n\nTo adiabatic approximation equation (15) describes a dual-branch vibronic potential energy of\nthe electron-coupled oscillator at i-site. The lower branch EL(q) is a double-well potential with\ntwo symmetric minima at \u00b1 q0 given by (site index dropped) q0 = \u221a [(G/K)2 \u2013 (Egu/2G)2]\nwhere Egu = |E2 \u2013 E1| is the energy gap between the two narrow electronic bands (even and\nodd, mixed by the PJT active odd-parity vibration. Using (15) the vibronic Hamiltonian reads:\nHvibL = \u2013 (h2/2m)(d2/dq2) + EL(q)\n\n(16)\n\nfor the lower branch and a corresponding one for the upper branch:\nHvibU = \u2013 (h2/2m)(d2/dq2) + EU(q)\n\n(17)\n\nThe appearance of a dual-branch vibronic potential energy surface (15) is, perhaps, the most\nspecific feature of the adiabatic approximation. The existence of the upper branch EU(q) is\noften disregarded less than correctly in studies of the double-well potential EL(q).\nTo first order we solve the pertinent Schrodinger equation by means of the linear combination\n\u03c7(q) = A\u03c7g(q-q0) + B\u03c7g(q+q0) \u221d Aexp(\u03be\u2212\u03be0)2 + Bexp(\u03be+\u03be0)2\n\n(18)\n\nwhere \u03c7g(q) is the ground-state wave function of a harmonic oscillator centered at q = 0:\n\u03c7g(q) = (K/\u03c0h\u03c9)1/4 exp(-[K/2h\u03c9]q2)\n\n(19)\n\nwhile h = h/2\u03c0. Also \u03be = \u221a(K/h\u03c9)q is a dimensionless lattice coordinate to appear throughout.\nInserting into Hvib\u03c7(q) = Evib\u03c7(q) two eigenvalues are obtained\nEvib U/L = (1 \u2013 S2)-1 {HRR \u00b1 (-HRL) \u00b1 S[HRR \u00b1 (-HRL)]}\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\nS = exp(\u2212\u03be02) with \u03be02 = (K/h\u03c9)q02 = (2EJT/h\u03c9)(1 \u2013 (Egu/4EJT)2)\n\n(21)\n\nis the overlap integral between the two lateral harmonic-oscillator wave functions.\n\n\fThe remaining matrix elements in (20) are\nHRR = (1\u20442 h\u03c9) (1 + \u03be02 \u2212 I1)\nHRL = (1\u20442 h\u03c9)S(1 \u2212 \u03be02 \u2212 I )\n\n(22)\n\nin which I and I1 are the following integrals:\nI = \u03c0\u22121/2 -\u221e \u222b +\u221e \u221a [(8EJT/h\u03c9)\u03be2 + (Egu/h\u03c9)2] exp(-\u03be2) d\u03be\nI1 = \u03c0\u22121/2 -\u221e \u222b +\u221e \u221a [(8EJT/h\u03c9)(\u03be+\u03be0)2 + (Egu/h\u03c9)2] exp(-\u03be2) d\u03be\n\n(23)\n\nUsing (22) the ground-state tunneling splitting is:\n\u2206E = EvibU \u2013 EvibL = 2(1 \u2013 S2)\u22121(SHRR \u2013 HRL) = [sinh(\u03be02)]\u22121 (HRR \u2013 S\u22121HRL) (24)\nBy means of the steepest-descent method, which works at 4EJT \u00bb Egu (small polaron), we\nobtain I ~ Egu/h\u03c9, I1 ~ 4EJT/h\u03c9 and since \u03be02 ~ 2EJT/h\u03c9, we finally get for small polarons\n\u2206E = [2sinh(\u03be02)]\u22121 Egu(1 \u2013 Egu/4EJT) ~ Egu exp(\u22122EJT/h\u03c9)\n\n(25)\n\nAt the other extreme (large polaron) 4EJT \u2265 Egu, conventional wisdom for large polarons leads\nto the tunneling splitting being given by the undressed electron bandgap: \u2206E ~ Egu. Here and\nabove EJT = G2/2K is the Jahn-Teller or coupling energy. For small polarons, EJT is about the\nheight of the interwell barrier.\nA comparison with familiar small polaron (Holstein) formulae is impending. Vibronic\nintraband mixing effects can also be considered based on a Hamiltonian similar to (14). The\nanalysis leads to a tunneling splitting as above with Egu standing for the bandwidth. At large\ncoupling strengths (or small bandwidths) equation (25) obtains where \u2206\u0395 is the itinerant\npolaron bandwidth.\nIn this respect it is worth noting that while the susy analysis leads to partner potentials of the\nforms (10)-(13), the adiabatic approach to the dual-branch vibronic potential energy leads to\nvery different forms (15). This is apparently due to the choice of a ground-state trial wave\nfunction, even though the ground state of (14) is described by a wave function (18) similar to\n(10). This comes to show that more has to be done to elucidate the ground-state properties of\nthe system described by equations (15).\n3.2. Solving for the susy problem of vibronic potential energy\nGiven the doubts in the consistency of the trial wave function (13) to solving for the adiabatic\nproblem, then one should regard (7) as a differential equation for the superpotential W(\u03be):\nW'(\u03be) = W(\u03be)2 \u2212 EU/L(\u03be)\n\n(26)\n\nThis is a Riccati equation [11] which should give the superpotential W(\u03be) and then from\nV+(\u03be) = W(\u03be)2 + W'(\u03be)\n\n(27)\n\n\fthe partner potential V+(\u03be) too. We see the partner potentials V\u00b1(\u03be) to be closely interrelated.\nThe differential equation (26) can be converted into a second-order linear equation by means\nof the substitution\nU(\u03be) = exp(\u2212\u222b W(\u03be)d\u03be)\n\n(28)\n\nyielding a vibronic Schr\u00f6dinger equation with zero eigenvalue\nU(\u03be)'' \u2212 EU/L(\u03be)U(\u03be) = 0\n\n(29)\n\nNow from U(\u03be) \u221d exp(-[x-x0]2) and equation (29) we get W(\u03be) \u221d 2[x \u2013 x0] which underlines\nthe elastic force character of the superpotential in the particular problem.\nThe adiabatic potentials EU/L(\u03be) are each composed of anharmonic parabolas at renormalized\nbottom curvatures preserving the oscillator mass. EU(\u03be) is a normal parabola centered at \u03be0 = 0\nat renormalized frequency \u03c9Uren = \u03c9bare(1 + 4EJT/Egu). In contrast, EL(\u03be) is a double well\nparabola with a central barrier at \u03be = 0 and lateral valleys bottoming at \u00b1\u03be0 (cf. (21) where \u03be0\n= \u221a{(2EJT/h\u03c9)[1 \u2013 (Egu/4EJT)2]} at (Egu/4EJT) \u00ab1 (small-polaron condition) with renormalized\nbottom frequencies \u03c9Lren = \u03c9bare \u221a[1 \u2013 (Egu/4EJT)2]. This gives two trial harmonic oscillator\nwave functions: \u03c7Lgren(\u03be) = \u03c7Lgren(\u03be-\u03be0) + \u03c7Lgren(\u03be+\u03be0) for EL(\u03be) and \u03c7Ugren(\u03be) for EU. Although\nthe above representation of ELren(\u03be) and EUren(\u03be) is only approximate, it will be good for\nprocesses not too high above the barrier top. For example, it will hold good for the ground\nstates of the adiabatic vibronic potentials. See Figure 4 for graphic representations.\n\n\f2\n\nK=1.5eV/A ,G=3eV/A,Egu=.75eV,D=9eV\n25\n20\n\nSuperpotential W (a.u.)\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n-25\n-20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nCoordinate \u03be\n\nFigure 4: The symmetric (solid) and bda asymmetric (dashed) adiabatic potentials, as\ncalculated using the equations of Section 3. Note that the lower and upper branches always\nappear in pairs, unlike isolated double wells appearing in previous Figures. In particular, the\ndouble wells on lower branches are formed by virtue of the electron-vibrational mode\ncoupling which creates two (a)symmetric valleys. The asymmetry arises as a modeindependent dipolar mixing energy is added to the interaction Hamiltonian as explained in\nSection 3.3.\n\n3.3. Asymmetric wells\nWe consider a few Hamiltonians in which electrostatic monopoles couple to a quantized field\nof off-center polarons. These are based on the original symmetric Hamiltonian (14) which\nmay be made asymmetric by introducing a coupling term or different curvatures for the leftand right- hand valleys. In another example the vibronic tunneling splitting is widened.\nHowever, this type conserves the original symmetry of Hamiltonian. Another one\nincorporates an electrostatic dipole coupling term D = \u2212 2p\u03b1\u03b2\u2022F in (14) so as to introduce\ndifferent depths for the double-well potential valleys:\nHM = \u03a3i\u03b2 E\u03b2 a\u03b2\u2020 ai\u03b2 + \u03a3i 1\u20442 Kq2 \u00b1 \u03a3 (Gq + 1\u20442D)(a1\u2020 a2 + a2\u2020 a1) + TN\nIts bda adiabatic potential is\n\n(30)\n\n\fEU/L (q) = 1\u20442 Kq2 \u00b1 1\u20442 \u221a [(2Gq + D)2 + (Egu)2]\n\n(31)\n\nEquations (15) and (31) represent examples of symmetric and asymmetric double wells of the\nvibronic problem. The vibronic potentials should be analyzed by adiabatic approximation and\nsusy qm.\n4. Comments\nConsidering an asymmetric double well composed of two valleys separated by an interwell\nbarrier, as in Figure 3, we stress that in the absence of an interwell coupling interaction\nthrough tunneling there is a 1-1-correspondence between the levels on the individual wells,\nexcept for the ground-state level on the deeper component which remains unpaired. The\ndifference between the ground state levels on the deeper and shallower components is\nregarded as reaction heat Q at 0 K. As the tunneling coupling is \"switched on\", the\nindividual levels split into pairs of tunneling components which are common for the\nindividual valleys. Again, the deep level on the asymmetric well is unpaired since there are no\ntunneling transitions to the shallow component starting from that deep level. For this reason,\nthe deep level does not change to first order unlike all the remaining levels and it is easy to\npredict that the position of the deep level will be one phonon quantum energy below the first\nexcited level on the deeper component: Q = nh\u03c9, usually for n = 1. Under these conditions,\nthe deep level will be unpaired in a susy pattern, while a 1-1- correspondence will be\nestablished between the tunneling levels. Now, the difference between the ground state split\nlevels on the two wells will have very little to do with the tunneling splitting, in either\nsymmetric and asymmetric double wells which is often mistaken in literature. The correct\ndefinition for a ground state tunneling splitting will be the difference between the first excited\nlevel and the ground state level in a symmetric double well, or between the second excited\nlevel and the first excited level above the deeper level on the asymmetric double well.\nComparing the present Figures 1 (a) and (b) with the graphic material on display in Reference\n[3], we see a general correspondence except for the abrupt central dip splitting the interwell\npeak in Figure 1 (a). This makes the potentials V-(\u03be) and V+(\u03be) similar though not akin to each\nother. The central dip feature in Fihure 1 (a) though missing in Reference [3] is remindful of\nearlier analytic work pointing to artifacts in the adiabatic approximation [12]. Indeed, through\ncarefully defining and removing the electronic nonadiabaticity operator, the author has\nobserved a central surge on top of the interwell maximum in the double well potential of a\nphonon coupled two level system. Our observation is of a surge-like dip on top of that same\npotential. One is tempting to check whether the two opposite-sign surges do not compensate\neach other under adiabatic conditions.\nFinally, we conclude that there is more interesting work ahead to elucidate the supersymmetric and adiabatic features of vibronic potentials in chemical physics.\nReferences\n[1] S.G.
