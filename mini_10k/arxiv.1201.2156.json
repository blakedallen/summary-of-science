In G\u00f6tz et al. [2007] a stochastic model for the fiber lay-down process,\ni.e. for the generation of a fiber web on a conveyor belt has been presented. Taking into account the fiber motion\nunder the influence of turbulence, the process can be described by a system of stochastic differential equations.\nWe shall focus on a very simple situation, which does not take into account the movement of the belt, and gives\nrise to a Fokker-Planck equation. Some numerical results will also be considered at the end of this paper.\nAn important criterion for the quality of the web and the resulting nonwoven material is how the solution\nconverges to equilibrium. In particular, the speed of convergence to the stationary solution is important. The\nfaster this convergence is, the more uniform the produced textile will be. From a technological point of view,\nprocess parameters should be adjusted such that the speed of convergence to equilibrium is optimal.\nThe trend to equilibrium for solutions of kinetic equations has been investigated in many papers using\nentropy methods; see for example Desvillettes and Villani [2001], Villani [2009]. A simplified approach has been\nsuggested in Dolbeault et al. [2011, 2009]. This trend to equilibrium for the Fokker-Planck equation for fiber\nlay-down under consideration in this paper has already been investigated using Dirichlet forms and operator\nsemi-group techniques in Grothaus and Klar [2008]; an ergodic theorem and explicit rates of convergence have\nbeen established. In the present paper we prove the convergence at an exponential rate towards a unique\nstationary state in a weighted L2 norm by adapting the method developed in Dolbeault et al. [2011, 2009] to\nthe setting of non-moving belts.\n2\n\nThe model and main results\n\nIn the melt-spinning process of nonwoven textiles, hundreds of individual endless fibers obtained by the\ncontinuous extrusion through nozzles of a melted polymer are stretched and entangled by highly turbulent\nair flows to finally form a web on a conveyor belt (see G\u00f6tz et al. [2007] for more details). We describe the\nmotion of an individual fiber, neglecting interactions with the others.\n\u2217 Correspondence\n\nto: Jean Dolbeault: Ceremade (UMR CNRS 7534), Universit\u00e9 Paris-Dauphine, Place de Lattre de Tassigny,\nF-75775 Paris C\u00e9dex 16, France.

SCHMEISER\n\nAn arclength parametrization of the laid down fiber in a coordinate system following the conveyor belt\nis given by x0 (t) \u2208 R2 , t \u2265 0. The tangent vector is denoted by dx0 (t)/dt = \u03c4 (\u03b1(t)) with \u03c4 (\u03b1) = (cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1),\n\u03b1 \u2208 S 1 = R/2\u03c0 Z. Since the lay-down process is assumed to happen at the constant normalized speed 1 (equal\nto the spinning speed), x0 (t) can also be interpreted as the position of the lay-down point at time t. If the\nconveyor belt moves with velocity \u03ba e1 , the history of the lay-down point in the laboratory frame (as opposed\nto the conveyor belt frame) is given by x(t) = x0 (t) + t \u03ba e1 , i.e.,\ndx\n= \u03c4 (\u03b1) + \u03ba e1 .\ndt\n\n(1)\n\nIt is a natural restriction that the speed of the conveyor belt cannot exceed the lay-down speed: 0 \u2264 \u03ba \u2264 1, since\notherwise a stationary lay-down point would be impossible. The lay-down process can now be determined by\nprescribing the dynamics of the angle \u03b1(t), decribed as a stochastic process. It is driven by a deterministic force\ntrying to move the lay-down point towards the equilibrium position x = 0 and by a Brownian motion modeling\nthe effect of the turbulent air flow:\nd\u03b1 = \u2212 \u03c4 \u22a5 (\u03b1) * \u2207V (x) dt + A dW ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere W denotes a one-dimensional Wiener process, A > 0 measures its strength relative to the deterministic\nforcing,\n\u03c4 \u22a5 = d\u03c4 /d\u03b1 = (\u2212 sin \u03b1, cos \u03b1), and V (x) is a potential such that e\u2212V is integrable with the normalisation\nR\n\u2212V\ne dx = 1 and \u2207V (0) = 0.\nR2\nThe system (1)\u2013(2) defines a stochastic process on R2 \u00d7 S 1 . The corresponding probability density f (t, x, \u03b1)\nsatisfies the Fokker-Planck equation\n\u2202t f + (\u03c4 + \u03ba e1 ) * \u2207x f \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 (\u03c4 \u22a5 * \u2207x V f + D \u2202\u03b1 f ) = 0 ,\n(with the diffusivity D = A2 /2) which will be the object of our study. The analysis of the long time behaviour\nis considerably simplified in the case of a nonmoving conveyor belt:\n\u03ba = 0.\nWe shall assume that this assumption holds true from now on. In this case the Fokker-Planck equation is written\nas an abstract ODE\n\u2202t f + Tf = D Lf ,\n(3)\nwith Tf = \u03c4 * \u2207x f \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 (\u03c4 \u22a5 * \u2207x V f ) and Lf = \u2202\u03b12 f .\nIt is easily seen that F (x, \u03b1) = e\u2212V (x) is an equilibrium solution of (3), lying in the intersection of the null\nspaces of T and L: TF = LF = 0.\nA convenient functional analytic setting is introduced by the scalar product\nZ\ndx d\u03bd(\u03b1)\nd\u03b1\nhf, gi :=\nf g d\u03bc , d\u03bc(x, \u03b1) :=\n, d\u03bd(\u03b1) :=\n,\nF (x, \u03b1)\n2\u03c0\nR2 \u00d7S 1\nand by the associated norm kf k2 = hf, f i. On the space L2 (R2 \u00d7 S 1 , d\u03bc), the operator T is skew symmetric,\nand the operator L is symmetric and negative semi-definite. Thus, we have\nd kf \u2212 F k2\n= D hLf, f i = \u2212D k\u2202\u03b1 f k2 .\ndt\n2\n\n(4)\n\nThis identity reveals the main difficulty in proving convergence to equilibrium. The decay to equilibrium seems\nto stop, as soon as f is in the null space of L consisting of all \u03b1-independent distributions. On the other hand,\nthe decay equation (4) does not make use of the action of the operator T and, in particular, of the fact that the\nequilibrium F is the unique probability density in N (T) \u2229 N (L). Any \u03b1-independent distribution function f is\nindeed unstable under the action of T, unless f = F . Hence, convergence to the equilibrium can be expected\nand will be proven to be exponential. This is a so-called hypocoercivity result as defined in Villani [2009]. A\nrecently developed approach Dolbeault et al. [2011, 2009] for proving hypocoercivity in the abstract setting (3)\nwill be applied with a special emphasis on the behaviour of the decay rate as D \u2192 0 and D \u2192 \u221e. It requires\nassumptions on the potential V , which have already been used in Dolbeault et al. [2011]:\n2,\u221e\n(H1) Regularity: V \u2208RWloc\n(R2 ).\n\u2212V\n(H2) Normalization: R2 e dx = 1.\n\n\fHYPOCOERCIVITY AND A FOKKER-PLANCK EQUATION FOR FIBER LAY-DOWN\n\n3\n\n(H3) Spectral gap condition: there exists a positive constant \u039b such that\nZ\nZ\n2 \u2212V\nu2 e\u2212V dx\n|\u2207x u| e dx \u2265 \u039b\nR2\n\nR2\n\nfor any u \u2208 H 1 (e\u2212V dx) such that R2 u e\u2212V dx = 0.\n(H4) Pointwise condition: there exists\n\u0001 c1 > 0 such that\n|\u22072x V (x)| \u2264 c1 1 + |\u2207x V (x)| for any x \u2208 R2 .\n\nR\n\nRoughly speaking, (H2) and (H3) require a sufficiently strong growth of V (x) as |x| \u2192 \u221e, whereas (H4) puts a\nlimitation on the growth behavior. This leaves room, however, for a large class of confining potentials including\nV (x) = (1 + |x|2 )\u03b2 , \u03b2 \u2265 1/2.\nIn Dolbeault et al. [2011], the additional pointwise condition \u2206x V (x) \u2264 \u03b82 |\u2207x V (x)|2 + c0 with c0 > 0 and\n\u221a\n\u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1) has\nis, however, a consequence of (H4) by \u2206x V (x) \u2264 2 |\u22072x V (x)| and the Young\n\u221a been required. This\ninequality 2 c1 |\u2207x V | \u2264 |\u2207x V |2 /4 + 2 c21 , with \u03b8 = 1/2 and c0 = c1 + 2 c21 .\nTheorem 1. Let f0 \u2208 L2 (R2 \u00d7 S 1 , d\u03bc) and let (H1)\u2013(H4) hold. Then, for every \u03b7 > 0, the solution of (3) subject\nto the initial condition f (t = 0) = f0 satisfies\nkf (t) \u2212 F k \u2264 (1 + \u03b7) kf0 \u2212 F k e\u2212\u03bbt\n\nwith\n\n\u03bb=\n\n\u03b7\nC1 D\n,\n1 + \u03b7 1 + C2 D2\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are two positive constants which depend only on the potential V .\nAs a consequence, we have\n\u03bb = O(D)\n\nas D \u2192 0\n\nand \u03bb = O(D\u22121 )\n\nas D \u2192 \u221e .\n\nBoth results are sharp, as can be seen from the toy problem in Dolbeault et al. [2011]. As D \u2192 0, dissipation\nis provided by the O(D) right hand side of (3), which dominates \u03bb. On the other hand, the dynamics for large\nD can be described by a macroscopic limit: see Bonilla et al. [2007/08]. When D \u2192 \u221e, the correct time scale is\nt = O(D) and corresponds to a parabolic scaling, and therefore \u03bb = O(D\u22121 ) had to be expected.\nHowever our method is not sharp in the sense that we cannot expect to obtain the optimal coefficients in\nthe limiting cases above. Again this can be seen from the toy problem in Dolbeault et al. [2011], where the\nspectral gap can be explicitly computed.\n3\n3.1\n\nProof of Theorem 1\nThe modified entropy\n\nWe introduce the deviation g := f \u2212 F , satisfying (3) subject to g(t = 0) = f0 \u2212 F . Following Dolbeault et al.\n[2011], we denote the orthogonal projection to N (L) by\nZ\n\u03a0g := \u03c1g =\ng d\u03bd .\nS1\n\nNote that\n\nR\nR2\n\n\u03c1g dx = 0 holds. In the following, we shall also need\nT\u03a0g = \u03c4 * (\u2207x \u03c1g + \u03c1g \u2207x V ) = \u03c4 * e\u2212V \u2207x (eV \u03c1g ) ,\n\n(5)\n\n\u03a0T\u03a0 = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith the consequence\nwhich is essential for the applicability of the method of Dolbeault et al. [2011]. It implies that the macroscopic\nlimit (corresponding to D \u2192 \u221e) in (3) is diffusive: see Bonilla et al. [2007/08].\nWith the help of the operator\n\u0001\u22121\n(T\u03a0)\u2217\nA = 1 + (T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0\nand an appropriately chosen \u03b5 > 0, the modified entropy functional is defined by\nH[g] :=\n\n1\nkgk2 + \u03b5 hAg, gi .\n2\n\n\f4\n\nJ. DOLBEAULT, A. KLAR, C. MOUHOT, AND C.

More precisely we have:\n1+\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\nkgk2 \u2264 H[g] \u2264\nkgk2 .\n2\n2\nA straightforward computation gives\nd\nH[g] = \u2212D[g] ,\ndt\n\n(7)\n\nD[g] = \u2212D hLg, gi + \u03b5 hAT\u03a0g, gi + \u03b5 hAT(1 \u2212 \u03a0)g, gi \u2212 \u03b5 hTAg, gi \u2212 \u03b5 D hALg, gi .\n\n(8)\n\nwith the entropy dissipation functional\n\n3.2\n\nMicroscopic and macroscopic coercivity\n\nThe first term on the right hand side of (8) has already been computed in (4). With d\u03bd = d\u03b1/(2\u03c0), the Poincar\u00e9\ninequality on S 1 ,\nZ\nZ\n\u00012\nR\n2\n|\u2202\u03b1 g| d\u03bd \u2265\ng \u2212 S 1 g d\u03bd d\u03bd\nS1\n\nS1\n\nimplies the microscopic coercivity property\n\u2212 hLg, gi \u2265 k(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk2 .\n\n(9)\n\nThe operator AT\u03a0 = (1 + (T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0)\u22121 (T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0 shares its spectral decomposition with (T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0. For the latter\nwe have, using (5)\nZ\n1\n2\ne\u2212V |\u2207x ug | dx d\u03bd ,\nh(T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0g, gi = kT\u03a0gk2 =\n2 R2 \u00d7S 1\nwith ug = eV \u03c1g . The spectral gap condition (H3) implies the macroscopic coercivity property\nh(T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0g, gi \u2265\n\n\u039b\nk\u03c1g k2 ,\n2\n\nleading to\nhAT\u03a0g, gi \u2265\n\n\u039b\nk\u03a0gk2 .\n2+\u039b\n\n(10)\n\nBy (9) and (10), the sum of the first two terms in the entropy dissipation (8) is coercive. This will also be\nsufficient for controlling the remaining three terms, if the operators AT, TA, and AL are bounded, for \u03b5 > 0,\nsmall enough.\n3.3\n\nBoundedness of auxiliary operators\n\nBy [Dolbeault et al., 2011, Lemma 1], we know that\nkTAgk \u2264 k(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk .\n\n(11)\n\nThe computation\n(T\u03a0)\u2217 Lg = \u2212\u03a0TLg = \u2212\u2207x * \u03a0(\u03c4 \u2202\u03b12 g) = \u2207x * \u03a0(\u03c4 g) = \u2212(T\u03a0)\u2217 g\nshows that AL = \u2212A and, thus,\nkALgk \u2264\n\n1\nk(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk .\n2\n\n(12)\n\nThe most elaborate part of the analysis is to prove the boundedness of AT. Following the approach of Dolbeault\net al. [2011], we consider its adjoint\n(AT)\u2217 = \u2212T2 \u03a0 1 + (T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0\n\n\u0001\u22121\n\n.\n\n\fHYPOCOERCIVITY AND A FOKKER-PLANCK EQUATION FOR FIBER LAY-DOWN\n\n5\n\n\u0001\u22121\nFor a given g \u2208 L2 (R2 \u00d7 S 1 , d\u03bc), we introduce h = 1 + (T\u03a0)\u2217 T\u03a0\ng which, after solving for g and applying \u03a0,\nbecomes\n1\n\u03c1g = \u03c1h \u2212 \u03a0T2 \u03c1h = e\u2212V uh \u2212 \u2207x * (e\u2212V \u2207x uh )\n(13)\n2\nwith uh = eV \u03c1h . A straightforward computation gives\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(AT)\u2217 g = \u2212T2 \u03c1h = e\u2212V (\u03c4 * \u2207x )2 uh \u2212 (\u03c4 \u22a5 * \u2207x V ) (\u03c4 \u22a5 * \u2207x uh )\nand, as a consequence,\nk(AT)\u2217 gk \u2264 \u2207\u22972\nx uh\n\nL2 (R2 ,e\u2212V dx)\n\n+ k|\u2207x V | |\u2207x uh |kL2 (R2 ,e\u2212V dx) .\n\nTherefore, in order to prove the boundedness of (AT)\u2217 (and, thus, of AT), we need to prove the boundedness of the\nright hand side in terms of k\u03c1g k for the solution uh of the elliptic equation (13). This L2 \u2192 H 2 (with weight e\u2212V )\nelliptic regularity result has been derived in Dolbeault et al. [2011] under the assumptions (H1)\u2013(H4) (see\nProposition 5 for the first term and Lemma 8 for the second). Collecting these results gives k(AT)\u2217 gk \u2264 CV kgk\nand therefore\nkAT(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk \u2264 CV k(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk ,\n(14)\nwhere CV depends only on the potential.\n3.4\n\nHypocoercivity\n\nInserting estimates (9)\u2013(12) and (14) in (8) gives\nD[g] \u2265 D k(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk2 +\n\u2265\n\nD \u2212 \u03b5 CV + 1\n\n\u2265\n\nD \u2212 \u03b5 CV + 1\n\n2\n\u03b5\u039b\nD\n2+\u039b k\u03a0gk \u2212 \u03b5 CV + 1 + 2 k(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk kgk\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b5\u039b\n+D\nk(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk2 + 2+\u039b\nk\u03a0gk2 \u2212 \u03b5 CV + 1 + D\n2\n2 k(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk k\u03a0gk\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n1\n\u039b\n+D\n1 + 2\u03b4\nk(1 \u2212 \u03a0)gk2 + \u03b5 2+\u039b\n\u2212 2\u03b4 CV + 1 + D\nk\u03a0gk2 ,\n2\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n(15)\n\nfor an arbitrary \u03b4 > 0. This shows already that coercivity can be achieved by first choosing \u03b4 and then \u03b5, both\nsmall enough. With the choice\n\u039b\n\u03b4=\n,\n(2 + \u039b) (CV + 1 + D/2)\nthe coefficients on the right hand side of (15) can be written as D \u2212 \u03b5 r(D) and \u03b5 s with\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u039b\n1\n2\u039b + (2 + \u039b) CV + 1 + D\nCV + 1 + D\n, s :=\n.\nr(D) :=\n2\n2\n2\u039b\n2 (2 + \u039b)\nThen the optimal choice of \u03b5, considering the form of the coefficients, would be\nD\n\u03b5(D) :=\n.\nr(D) + s\n1+\u03b5\nHowever, we also have to guarantee \u03b5 < 1 for the definiteness of H[g] and actually, even stronger, 1\u2212\u03b5\n\u2264 (1 + \u03b7)2\n\u03b7\nwill be needed below, which can be guaranteed by the requirement \u03b5 \u2264 1+\u03b7 . Moreover the two conditions are\nequivalent at first order for \u03b7 > 0, small. These considerations lead to the choice\n\b\n\u03b7 \u03b5(D)\n, with \u03b5max = max 1, max \u03b5(D) ,\n\u03b5=\nD>0\n1 + \u03b7 \u03b5max\n\nwhich is finite because of \u03b5(0) = \u03b5(\u221e) = 0. With this choice,\n\u03b7\n2 C1 D\n=: 2 \u03bb ,\n1 + \u03b7 1 + C2 D 2\nwith appropriately chosen constants C1 , C2 > 0, depending only on \u039b and CV and, thus, only on the potential V .\nThe estimate\n4\u03bb\nH[g] > 2 \u03bb H[g]\nD[g] \u2265 2 \u03bb kgk2 \u2265\n1+\u03b5\nfollows. Using this in (7) and the Gronwall lemma imply\nD \u2212 \u03b5 r(D) \u2265 \u03b5 s \u2265\n\nH[f (t) \u2212 F ] \u2264 H[f0 \u2212 F ] e\u22122\u03bbt .\nFinally we obtain for the norm\n2\n2\nH[f (t) \u2212 F ] \u2264\nH[f0 \u2212 F ] e\u22122\u03bbt\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1\u2212\u03b5\n1+\u03b5\n\u2264\nkf0 \u2212 F k2 e\u22122\u03bbt \u2264 (1 + \u03b7)2 kf0 \u2212 F k2 e\u22122\u03bbt ,\n1\u2212\u03b5\nwhich completes the proof of Theorem 1.\nkf (t) \u2212 F k2\n\n\u2264\n\n\f6\n\nJ.

We use a classical Monte-Carlo method with an Euler-Maruyama discretization scheme\nfor all computations. A numerical investigation of the equations using a semi-Lagrangian method can be found\nin Klar et al. [2009].\nThe exponential decay of the L2 -difference to the stationary solution is observed in Figure 1. In Figure 2 the\ndecay rates \u03bb have been obtained from the above simulations for various values of A using a least square fit. The\nrate given by Theorem 1, i.e. \u03bb \u223c 1 +CC1 2DD2 , D = A2 /2, fits qualitatively very well the curve obtained in Figure 2\nwhen A is away from 0. In particular, values of A with an optimal rate of convergence can be determined from\nthe numerical as well as the analytical results.\n4.2\n\nPerspectives\n\n1. Models where stationary solutions are not known explicitly. The model considered in this paper can be\nextended in different directions, for instance by taking into account the movement of the belt, or by\nmodels where fibers have smoother trajectories than the ones considered in this paper, see Herty et al.\n[2009], Bonilla et al. [2007/08]. In these cases the stationary solutions are not always known explicitly. The\napplication of the entropy method presented above is then an open problem.\n2. 3-D models. To model fluid flow through a fiber web, the model has to be extended to three dimensional\nsituations, see Klar et al. [2012]. For such a model exponential convergence to equilibrium, at least for the\ncase \u03ba = 0, can be proven with the same methods as in this paper.\nAcknowledgements.
