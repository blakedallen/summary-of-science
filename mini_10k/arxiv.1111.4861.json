A set of different instruments run simultaneously for a number of nights variable between 10 and 20\nnights with the aim to quantify different parameters characterizing the optical turbulence (the seeing \u03b5, the isoplanatic\nangle \u03b80 , the wavefront coherence time \u03c40 , the spatial coherence outer scale L0 , the vertical profile of the spatial coherence outer scale L0 (h),....). The instruments employed were:\na DIMM (Differential Image Motion Monitor), a GSM (Generalized Seeing Monitor), a MASS (Multi Aperture Scintillation Sensor), a LuSci (Lunar Scintillometer), a MOSP\n(Monitor of Outer Scale Profiler) and a Generalized Scidar (GS). Some of these instruments (the DIMM and GSM)\n\n?\n\nE-mail: masciadri@arcetri.astro.it\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\nprovide integrated values of the turbulence energy (\u03b5, \u03b80 ,\n\u03c40 , etc.) developed above the ground up to 20-25 km. Some\nof the instruments (the GS, the MASS, LuSci) are vertical\n2\nprofilers of the turbulent energy (CN\nprofiles) or other astroclimatic parameter such as the spatial coherence outer scale\n(MOSP). One of the main goals of the PAR2007 site testing\ncampaign was the inter-comparison of measurements that\nis a crucial passage not only for the characterization of a\nsite, but, even more, for a characterization of the accuracy,\nuncertainty and dispersion of each instrument with respect\nto others. Dali Ali et al. (2010) presented a summary of\nthe analysis of all the measurements retrieved from all these\ninstruments from 17 December up to 26 December 2007.\nThe GS is a vertical profiler based on an optical remote\nsensing technique that is able to reconstruct the turbulence\ndistribution developed on the whole atmosphere from the\nground up to 20-25 km.

Binary stars observed during the PAR2007 site testing campaign (20 nights) extracted from the Bright Stars Catalogue. In\nthe first column the name of the star, in the second and third columns the right ascension and the declination, in the fourth column the\nmagnitude of the primary star, in the fifth column the difference in magnitude between the primary and secondary star of each binary,\nin the last column the angular separation.\n\npends on the binary separation, the wavelength and the geometrical optical set-up as:\n\u2206H(h) =\n\n0.78 *\n\np\n\n\u03bb|h \u2212 hgs |\n\u03b8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere h is the height from the ground, hgs is the conjugated height under-ground (see Section 2) and \u03b8 is the\nbinary separation. Considering the typical values of the binaries used for the GS, we can say that the GS vertical\nresolution is typically of the order of 1 km. The GS is, at\npresent, one of the most useful and reliable instrument for a\ndeep and detailed characterization of the optical turbulence\nand its spatial distribution in the atmosphere because, with\n2\nprofiles and the wind speed1 profiles, it is possible to\nthe CN\nretrieve basically all the key parameters characterizing the\noptical turbulence for astronomical applications. The principle of the GS is solid, simple and many GS instruments\nhave been developed in the last decade by different teams\nin the world. However, the GS is not a practical instrument\nfor long terms and systematic monitoring of the turbulence\nand its distribution above an astronomical site because it requires a telescope with a pupil size of at least 1 m. For this\napplication it is preferable to use automatic monitors such\nas the MASS, for example. The latter has a lower resolution\n(\u2206h \u223c h/2) even if, recently, solutions to increase the resolution in the troposphere have been proposed - (Kornilov &\nKornilov 2011).\nThe necessity to recalibrate the GS measurements of the\nPAR2007 campaign appeared urgent after the recent studies (Johnston et al. (2002) and Avila et al. (2009)) that put\n2\nin evidence an error in the procedure for retrieving the CN\nprofiles in the standard GS technique (in the post-processing\nphase) that could induce an overestimate of the turbulence.\nThe error is perfectly described analytically therefore measurements can be corrected in a post-processing phase. In\n\n1\n\nThe wind speed can in principle be retrieved from the GS that\nhas been applied with this goal in many studies (Avila et al.\n(2001), Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2006), Avila et al. (2006), Egner et\nal. (2007), Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2009), Masciadri et al. (2010)).\nHowever, it is worth noting that it has been proved (Masciadri\n& Garfias (2001), Hagelin et al. (2010)) that, wind speed profiles from meso-scale models can supply equivalent reliable estimates of this parameter with the advantage of a larger spatial\nand temporal cover. For a systematic turbulence monitoring this\nis a preferable solution.\n\nthis paper we summarize the results obtained after the recalibration of the data-set. A statistical analysis as well as\nan analysis on each single night and for each instant along\nall the nights is performed so to have an absolute unbiased\nreference for the GS measurements.\nIn Section 2 we describe the main principle of the GS\ntechnique, where the error of the GS technique has been\nidentified and how to correct it. Effects of the errors in2\nprofiles are discussed in Section\nduced on the vertical CN\n3.1. Effects of errors induced on the total seeing as well as\nthe boundary and free atmosphere contributions are treated\nin Section 3.2. In Section 3.3 we treat the effects of errors\ninduced on the isoplanatic angle. Besides, in Section 3 a\nstatistic of the median values of total seeing, boundary and\nfree atmosphere seeing as well as isoplanatic angle obtained\nafter re-calibration are provided. A brief discussion is presented in Section 4. In Section 5 the conclusions of this study\nare presented.\n\n2\n\nTHE INSTRUMENT AND THE\nRE-CALIBRATION\n\nThe SCIDAR technique (Scintillation Detection and Ranging) has been originally proposed by Vernin & Azouit (1983)\nand Rocca et al. (1974) to measure the vertical optical turbulence distribution (the refractive index structure constant\n2\nCN\nprofiles) in the troposphere. The technique relies on the\nanalysis of the scintillation images generated by binary stars\non the pupil plane of a telescope. The standard SCIDAR\ntechnique (called Classic Scidar) is insensitive to the turbulence near the ground. This fact represented in the past\nan important limitation for monitoring turbulence for astronomical applications because it is known that most of\nthe turbulence develops in the low part of the atmosphere.\nTo overcome this limitation (Fuchs et al (1994), Fuchs et\nal. (1998)) proposed a generalized version of the SCIDAR\n(called Generalized SCIDAR - GS) in which the detector is\nvirtually conjugated below the ground at a distance hgs permitting to extend the measurements range to the whole atmosphere (from the ground up to \u223c 20-25 km). GS measurements have been later done by several authors above different astronomical sites using instruments developed by several different teams (Avila et al. (1997), Avila et al. (1998),\nAvila et al. (2004), Kluckers et al. (1998), Mc Kenna et al.\n(2003), Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2006), Egner et al. (2007), Egc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fRe-calibrated Generalized-Scidar measurements at Cerro Paranal\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Left: pupil of the Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) of the VLT at Cerro Paranal: D=1.8 m, e=0.07. Right: autocorrelation of the\ntelescope pupil shown on the left panel.\n\nner & Masciadri (2007), Fuensalida et al. (2008), Masciadri\net al. (2010), Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2011), Garcia-Lorenzo\net al. (2011b), Avila et al. (2011)).\nThe GS PAR2007 measurements were taken from an\nAuxiliary Telescope (AT) of the VLTI with CUTE-Scidar\nIII instrument, which has been developed by the Instituto\nde Astrofsica de Canarias (IAC) team (V\u00e1zquez-Rami\u00f3 et\nal., 2008) to be used at the Paranal Observatory within the\nEuropean project ELT design study. This instrument is an\nimproved version of others previously developed by the same\ngroup for Roque de los Muchachos and Teide Observatories, which has been used since 2002 to extensively monitor\nthe optical turbulence at both observatories (Fuensalida et\nal., 2004, Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2011), Garcia-Lorenzo et\n2\nproal. (2011b)). CUTE-Scidar III instrument provides CN\nfiles in real time without dome and mirror seeing components. The binary stars specifications observed during the\nPAR2007 site testing campaign are listed in Table 1. Considering the combinations of values of \u03b8 and hgs used in\nthe observations, we calculated that, using Eq.3, the typical\nvertical resolution \u2206H at h=0 is within 400-1000 m. The\n\u2206H(h) increases as Eq.3.\nThe GS is based on the observation of binaries having\nan angular separation typically of \u223c 3-10 arcsec, magnitude\n\u2264 5-6 mag and a \u2206m \u223c 1 mag. When two plane wavefronts\ncoming from a binary and propagating through the atmosphere meet a turbulent layer located at a height h from the\nground, they produce, on the detector plan, optically placed\nbelow the ground at a few kilometers (hgs ), two scintillation\nmaps characterized by typical shadows appearing in couple\nat a distance d. Such a distance is geometrically related to\nthe position of the turbulent layer as d = \u03b8(h+hgs ). The\ncalculation of the auto-covariance (AC) of the scintillation\nmap, normalized by the average of the intensity of the scintillation maps, produce the so called 'triplet'. The central\npeak is located in the centre of the AC frame; the lateral\npeaks are located at a symmetric distance d from the centre. The amplitude of the lateral peaks is proportional to the\nstrength of the turbulence of the layer located at the height\nh weighted by the scintillation that such a layer produces\non the detector. In a multi-layers atmosphere, different turbulent layers (i) produce triplets with lateral peaks located\nat different distances di from the centre of the AC frame.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n2\nprofiles are obtained inverting the normalized funcThe CN\ntion just described called Friedholm equation that describes\nseveral triplets.\nIn 2002, Johnston et al. put in evidence an error in the\ncalculation of the normalization of the AC frames and they\n2\nprofiles for h\nstudied the effects of this error on the CN\n= 0.

For each binary star (i.e. for a fixed\nangular separation \u03b8 and magnitude ratio \u2206m) the relative error is calculated for different values of the conjugated\nheight under the ground (hgs ) (full, dashed and pointed\nlines). Panels in Fig.2 include all the combinations of the\nset of parameters from which the error \u03b6 depends on. Typically 3 or 4 binary stars are observed in each night and the\nposition of the conjugated plane has been changed sometime\nduring the nights. As a consequence, in each night we have\nthe sequence of a few of the \u03b6(h) shown in Fig.2. We observe\nin Fig.2 that \u03b6 assumes a value of the order of 10% for h\n\n=0 in almost all of the cases but it increases monotonically\nwith the height reaching also values of the order of 40-60%\nin some cases above 15 km (BS1563). It is however worth\nnoting that this happens for a small percentage of cases (see\nnumbers in parenthesis in the panels of Fig.2). Indeed, if\n2\nwe look at the average CN\nprofiles obtained in each night\nbefore and after the re-calibration (Annex A), we note that\n2\nthe vertical distribution (shape of the CN\n) remains substantially the same for each height and the difference between\n2\nthe original and the corrected CN\nprofiles appears small.\nThis fact indicates that it is important to consider always\nboth elements to appreciate the impact of the \u03b6(h) error on\nGS measurements. Looking at Fig.A, we note that the shape\n2\nof the CN\nprofile is always characterized by a principal peak\nnear the ground with most of the turbulent contribution.\nHowever, in the free atmosphere, we observe very different\nspatial distributions of the turbulence in each night and it\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fRe-calibrated Generalized-Scidar measurements at Cerro Paranal\n\n5\n\nFigure 4.

This tells\nus that in the free atmosphere there is a large variability of\nthe position of the layers in each night.

Empty\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\ntemporal windows correspond to an interruption of acquisition on the same binary star in some cases or to the change\nof the binary star in some other cases. Looking at Fig.B and\nFig.C (Section 3.2) it is possible to identify the instants in\nwhich the binaries have been changed and it is possible to\ndiscriminate between the two cases. In case the binary star\nis changed, this means that the parameters from which the\nrelative error \u03b6(h) depends on are changed and therefore the\nvalue of the relative error changes sharply its value. We note\nthat, most frequently, each night is characterized by a few\nlayers (a sort of background structure) that are present during the whole night. Sometime it happens however, that a\nparticular layer appears or disappears at a precise time during the night, for example on 10/11/2007 at 12 km at around\n04:15 UT; on 17/12/2007 at 13 km at around 06:00 UT; on\n19/12/2007 at 4 km at around 05:00 UT; on 20/12/2007 at\n2 km at around 06:00 UT. Depending on the height and the\nintensity of each turbulent layers these events can induce\nmore or less rapid and important changes of the integrated\nastro-climatic parameters. For example, the disappearing of\na layer at 15 km can frequently produce, a weak decreasing of the total seeing (at this height the turbulent layers\nare in general much weaker than near the ground) but an\nimportant increase of the isoplanatic angle that is particularly sensitive to even small turbulence changes in the high\natmosphere.\n2\nFigure 3 shows the median CN\nprofile obtained with\nthe re-calibrated data-set associated to all the 20 nights of\nthe PAR2007 campaign.

Similar equations have been built for the relative error for \u03b5BL and \u03b5F A\nreplacing the extremes of the integrals with the ranges: [01000m] and [1000m,20km]. Looking at Fig.C, we see that, in\nall cases, the relative error of the boundary layer is relatively\nmodest, most of time of the order of 5-9%. The relative error\nof the free atmosphere seeing is slightly greater but always\nsmaller than 15%. It is greater than 10% only in 5 occasions\n(16/11/2007, 17/11/2007, 14/12/2007, 16/12/2007) and for\na partial part of the night. We note that, for the boundary layer contribution, the relative error is almost constant\nand it changes its values basically when the binary star is\nchanged. On the other side, the relative errors of the free\natmosphere fluctuate in time (sometimes in a not negligible way but always more than in the boundary layer where\nthe relative error remains basically constant in each segment associated to each observed binary). Why ? It is true\nthat the absolute error (Eq.2) increases with the height but\nthis means that the relative errors at each instant and the\nsuccessive one are both larger in the high part of the atmosphere than in the low part of the atmosphere. Therefore\nthe fact that we note a systematic and more evident variation of the relative error in successive instants in the free\natmosphere and not in the boundary layer can not be related to this reason. This is highly probably due to the fact\n2\nthat the CN\nin the free atmosphere is, in absolute terms, a\n2\ncouple of order of magnitude smaller than the CN\nnear the\nground. As a consequence, when we calculate the relative\nerror in the free atmosphere, we find that small variations\n2\nin the CN\nare associated to larger difference between the\nrelative error at an instant t0 and the successive one. In\nother words, the variation of the numerator of Eq.4 at two\nsuccessive instants is much more smaller than the denominator in the case of the boundary layer than in the case\nof the free atmosphere. Figure 4 shows the relative errors\nfor the total seeing, the seeing in the boundary layer and\nin the free atmosphere as a function of the corresponding\nvalues of seeing for all the nights of the PAR2007 site testing campaign. It is evident that no correlation exist between\n\nFigure 6.

The numbers in the panels are the median values calculated before (bold style line) and after (thin style line) the\nre-calibration.\n\nthe relative error and the corresponding value of the seeing.\nThis means that it is not possible to retrieve any relation\nbetween the value of the relative error of the seeing and\nthe value of the seeing. However, it is possible to note that\nthe fluctuations of the relative errors in the free atmosphere\nare larger than in the boundary layer and the distribution\nof the relative errors of the seeing assumes a sort of 'cloud\nshape'. Figure 5 shows the re-calibrated averaged values of\nthe seeing calculated in each nights versus the original averaged values. As expected, a systematic decreasing of the\nestimated turbulence in the re-calibrated data is evident. At\nthe same time, we observe that the difference on the mean\nvalues (before and after the re-calibration) is very small if\ncompared to the standard deviation of each estimate. The\ngreater is the seeing, the greater is the absolute difference\nbetween the average seeing before and after re-calibration.\nFigure 6 shows the cumulative distribution of the total seeing, seeing in the boundary layer and in the free atmosphere\nbefore and after the re-calibration. The corresponding median values reported in Fig.6 tell us that the absolute errors\nfor the median values of the seeing are: \u2206\u03b5BL =0.05 arcsec, \u2206\u03b5F A =0.04 arcsec, \u2206\u03b5T OT =0.06 arcsec. In Annex E is\nshown the temporal evolution of the seeing (total, boundary\nlayer and free atmosphere for each night.\nIt is worth noting (Fig.7) that the relative error of the\ntotal energy J (measured in m1/3 ) defined as:\n20km\n\nZ\nJ=\n\n2\nCN\n(h)dh\n\n(7)\n\n0\n\nis higher than that of the seeing and it can reach 20%\nin the free atmosphere, as well as in the total atmosphere.\nWe distinguished between J and seeing because, in some\napplications, it can be preferable to treat the total energy\ninstead of the seeing. J is indeed linear with respect to addition while seeing is not.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\n\fRe-calibrated Generalized-Scidar measurements at Cerro Paranal\n\n7\n\nFigure 7.

Relative error versus isoplanatic angle (left) and cumulative distribution of the isoplanatic angle (\u03b80 ) before (bold style line)\nand after (thin style line) the re-calibration of the data (right).\n\n3.3\n\nIsoplanatic angle\n\nIn Annex D is reported the temporal evolution of the relative\nerror of the iso-planatic angle (\u03b80 ) for all the 20 nights of\nthe PAR2007 campaign. \u03b80 is defined as:\n\n\uf8eb hup\n\uf8f6\u22123/5\nZ\n2\n\u03b80 = 0.057 * \u03bb6/5 \uf8ed\nh5/3 CN\n(h)dh\uf8f8\n\n(8)\n\n0\n\nwhere hup corresponds to the top of the atmosphere (more\nfrequently to the end of vertical profile). We observe that the\nfeatures of the temporal evolution of the \u03b80 relative error are\nsimilar to those of the free atmosphere seeing. This is not\nsurprising because the isoplanatic angle is particularly sensitive to the turbulence in the high part of the atmosphere\ndue to the presence of the factor h5/3 in the integral. The\n\u03b80 relative error is never larger than 18% with the exception\nof a few minutes on 17/11/2007 in which the error was of\nthe order of 18%. Figure 8-left shows the \u03b80 relative error\nversus the corresponding value of \u03b80 related to all the 20\nnights of the PAR2007 site testing campaign. Also in this\ncase, as well as for the seeing, no correlation between the\ntwo quantities is observed. Figure 8-right shows the cumulative distribution of the iso-planatic angle before and after\nre-calibration. As expected, the median value of the distribution increases after the re-calibration (from 1.74 arcsec\nto 1.87 arcsec) because the total turbulence decreases. We\nhighlight that \u03b80 in Fig.8 is calculated using hup =20 km\n(i.e. 20 km from the ground). Previous studies in the litc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201310\n\nerature (Avila et al. (2004), Masciadri et al. (2004), Egner\net al. (2007), Masciadri et al. (2010), Hagelin et al. (2011),\nGarcia-Lorenzo et al. (2011), Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2011b))\nperformed the calculation of \u03b80 with a value of hup between\n20 and 22 km from the ground. To estimate the effect of the\nvalue of hup on \u03b80 and to evaluate potential differences due\nthis element, we calculated the integral using hup =22 km.\nWe find, respectively, 1.73 arcsec and 1.87 arcsec. We conclude, therefore, that the median value of \u03b80 remains the\nsame (1.87 arcsec) within one hundredth of arcsec in these\ndata-set. In Annex F is shown the temporal evolution of the\nisoplanatic angle for each night.\n\n4\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFrom a qualitative point of view we can say that, as shown\nin Avila & Cuevas (2009), the greater is the distance of the\nconjugated plane under ground (hgs ), the greater is \u03b6(h);\nthe greater is the binary separation \u03b8, the greater is \u03b6(h);\nthe greater is \u2206m, the greater is \u03b6(h); the smaller is the\npupil size D, the greater is \u03b6(h); the greater is the ratio between the central obscuration and the pupil size e=D\u2217 /D,\nthe greater is \u03b6(h) near the ground. What about the quantitative effects ? We put in the context our results with respect\nto others recently published.\nMasciadri et al. (2010), treating a sample of measurements related to 43 nights done above Mt. Graham (VATT\ntelescope - D=1.83 m), proved that GS measurements obtained with a pupil size D \u2265 1.83 m and a binary separation\n\n\f8\n\nE. Masciadri et al.\n\n\u03b8 \u2264 8 arcsec are affected by this error for less than a few\nhundredths of an arcsec (0.04 arcsec corresponding to a relative error of \u223c 5% for the total seeing) with an average\n2\nCN\nprofile reproducing the same spatial distribution of the\nun-corrected profile.\nSimilar results have been obtained by Avila et al. (2011)\ntreating measurements done above the San Pedro M\u00e1rtir\nObservatory (D =1.5 m and D=2.1 m) in which it has been\nestimated a typical relative error of 4.2% (an absolute error\nof \u223c 0.04 arcsec on the total seeing). Modest errors therefore\neven if, in that case, a binary with \u03b8 = 14.4 arcsec (\u03b6 Uma)\nwas selected among the targets. The modest relative error\nis due to the fact that the percentage of time of observation\nof \u03b6 Uma was relatively low (14.4 %).\nResults of this paper for measurements done at Cerro\nParanal with a pupil size D=1.8 m are coherent and similar\nto the previous ones. A relative error for the total seeing of\n5.6% (absolute error equal to 0.06 arcsec) and a relative error\nof the isoplanatic angle of 6.9% (absolute error equal to 0.13\narcsec) are calculated. In just one case a binary separation\nlarger than 10 arcsec has been used (BS1563 - \u03b8=12.3 arcsec\n- percentage of observation is 7%).\nSome larger errors have been observed in the study performed at Roque de los Muchachos Observatories on Canary\nIslands (Garcia-Lorenzo et al. (2011b)) because a set of different geometric parameters (wider binary separation and\ndeeper conjugation heights of the detector plane) have been\nused in combination with a smaller telescope pupil size. In\nthe study of Roque de los Muchachos (D=1 m), five binaries\nwith angular separation wider than 10 arcsec (for a percentage of time equal to 3.39%) have been selected. The absolute\nerror of the median values of the total seeing is of the order\nof 0.12-0.15 arcsec and that of \u03b8 of the order of 0.34-0.92\narcsec (for observations at high and low vertical resolution).\nWe conclude that, considering the relative small percentage\nof observations with wide binaries, the element that mostly\naffected the overestimate of the turbulence in the study done\nat Roque de los Muchachos was the small size of the pupil\nof the telescope (D=1 m) and a deep conjugation heights of\nthe detector plane. However, looking at Fig.5 (Avila et al.\n(2009)), we observe that, from a quantitive point of view,\nthe impact of the telescope pupil size is much more important than the conjugation heights of the detector plane. The\nsize of the telescope seems therefore to be the most critical\nparameter in the error of the normalization of the average\nof the scintillation map in the GS measurements published\nso far. To contain the relative error it is suggested to keep\nthe value of the conjugated height under ground hgs at 2 or\n3 kilometers maximum and to use a telescope with a pupil\nsize of at least 1.5 m. The binary separation affected less\nthe statistical results published so far because the number\nof measurements obtained with wide binaries was relatively\nsmall.\n\n2\ntion of the optical turbulence (CN\nprofiles) indicates relative\nerrors that can achieve order of 40-60% (Fig.2) in some part\nof the atmosphere and in some narrow temporal windows.\nHowever, when we calculate the relative errors of the integrated counterparts, the relative error reach a maximum\nvalue of 13% for the correspondent total seeing \u03b5T OT and\n15% for the free atmosphere. The absolute errors are much\n2\nsmaller, particularly if one considers the CN\naverage on a\n2\nwhole night. The shape of the average of the CN\nprofiles\nbefore and after re-calibration is basically the same. For\nwhat concerns the integrated astroclimatic parameters, from\na statistical point of view, we find a relative error of the median value of the total seeing equal to 5.6%, for the seeing\nin the boundary layer equal to 5.6% and for the seeing in\nthe free atmosphere seeing equal to 9%. These values correspond to absolute errors respectively equal to 0.06 arcsec,\n0.05 arcsec and 0.04 arcsec. The absolute errors provided\nby the boundary layer and the free atmosphere contributions are statistically comparable even if the relative error\nincreases with the height. The relative error of the turbulent energy J is slightly larger. It can reach a maximum\nof 21% in the total atmosphere and 23% in the free atmosphere. The relative errors for the isoplanatic angle are never\nlarger than 18%. The absolute error of the median value of\n\u03b80 is 0.13 arcsec. The re-calibration of the GS data-set performed in this paper suggests a revision of results obtained\nin (Dali Ali et al. 2010) on the cross-comparison between\noptical turbulence measurements obtained with different instruments during the PAR2007 campaign. A few of us are,\nat present, deeply involved in a cross-checking of such a measurements with predictions performed with an atmospherical non-hydrostatic numerical model and a forthcoming paper will be dedicated to this topic.\nResults of this paper, joint with results found on previous papers on the same topic, indicate that, if a GS is\nused with a pupil size D \u2265 1.8 m and an angular separation\nsmaller than 10 arcsec (preferably with a value of the conjugated plane not deeper than \u223c 3 km underground), the\nabsolute errors can be considered negligible (of the order of\na few hundredth of arcseconds) from a statistical point of\nview.\nIf D < 1.8 m and/or the angular separation is greater\nthan 10 arcsec, the re-calibration is highly suggested, in particular if one is interested on some specific temporal windows. We remember that it has been proved (Masciadri et\nal. 2010) that the GS-HVR technique Egner & Masciadri\n(2007) to be applied in first kilometer from the ground is\nnot sensible to the error of the normalization of the autocorrelation. This solution can therefore be selected to investigate the turbulence at high vertical resolution near the\nground (first kilometer) without necessity to re-calibrate the\nmeasurements.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n5\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper a re-calibration of the whole data-set of measurements performed with the Generalized Scidar (CUTEScidar) at Cerro Paranal on November/December 2007\n(PAR2007 site testing campaign) for 20 nights is performed.\nThe statistical analysis of the spatial and temporal distribu-\n\nThis study is funded by the ESO contract number E-SOWESO-245-0933 (MOSE Project - PI: E.
