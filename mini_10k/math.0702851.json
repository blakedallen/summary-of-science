Tresser\n[4] made a startling discovery concerning certain rigidity properties in onedimensional dynamics. While analysing the transition between simple and\n\"chaotic\" dynamical behavior in \"typical\" one-parameter families of unimodal\nmaps \u2013 such as the quadratic family x 7\u2192 \u03bbx(1 \u2212 x) \u2013 they recorded the\nparameter values \u03bbn at which successive period-doubling bifurcations occurred\nin the family and found a remarkable universal scaling law, namely\n\u03bbn \u2212 \u03bbn\u22121\n\u2192 4.669 . . . .\n\u03bbn+1 \u2212 \u03bbn\nThey also found universal scalings within the geometry of the post-critical set\nof the limiting map corresponding to the parameter \u03bb\u221e = lim \u03bbn (cf. the work\nof E. Vul, Ya. Sinai and K. Khanin [29]). In an attempt to explain these\nphenomena, they introduced a certain nonlinear operator acting on the space\nof unimodal maps \u2013 the so-called period doubling operator. They conjectured\nthat the period-doubling operator has a unique fixed point which is hyperbolic\nwith a one-dimensional unstable direction. They also conjectured that the\nuniversal constants they found in their experiments are the eigenvalues of the\nderivative of the operator at the fixed point.\nA few years later (1982) this conjecture was confirmed by O. Lanford\n[18] through a computer assisted proof. Working in a cleverly defined Banach\nspace of real analytic maps and using rigorous numerical analysis on the computer, Lanford established at once the existence and hyperbolicity of the fixed\npoint of the period-doubling operator. Subsequent work by M. Campanino and\nH. Epstein [2] (also Campanino et al. [3] and Epstein [9]) established the existence (but neither uniqueness nor hyperbolicity) of the fixed point without\nessential help from the computer.\nIt was soon realized by Lanford and others that the period-doubling operator was just a restriction of another operator acting on the space of unimodal maps \u2013 the renormalization operator \u2013 whose dynamical behavior is\nmuch richer. The hopes were high that the iterates of this operator would\nreveal the small scale geometric properties of the critical orbits of many interesting one-dimensional systems. Hence, the initial conjecture was generalized\nto the following.\nRenormalization Conjecture. The limit set of the renormalization\noperator in the space of maps of bounded combinatorial type is a hyperbolic\nCantor set where the operator acts as the full shift in a finite number of symbols.\n(For a precise formulation of what is meant by bounded combinatorial\ntype, see \u00a72.2 below.)\n\n\f734\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nIn the path towards a proof of this conjecture, several new ideas were\ndeveloped in the last 20 years by a number of mathematicians, especially\nD. Sullivan, C. McMullen and M. Lyubich. Among the deepest in Dynamical Systems, these ideas have the complex dynamics of quadratic-like maps\n(in the sense of Douady and Hubbard [6]) as a common thread. Sullivan proved\nin [28] that all limits of renormalization are quadratic-like maps with a definite\nmodulus. Then, constructing certain Teichm\u00fcller spaces from quadratic-like\nmaps and using a substitute of Schwarz's lemma in these spaces, Sullivan established the existence of horseshoe-like limit sets for renormalization. Later,\nusing a different approach based on Mostow rigidity, McMullen [23] gave another proof of this result and went further by showing that the convergence\n(in the C 0 sense) towards the limit set is exponential.\nThe final breakthrough came with the work of Lyubich [20]. He endowed\nthe space of germs of quadratic-like maps (modulo affine conjugacies) with a\nvery subtle complex structure, showing that the renormalization operator is\ncomplex-analytic with respect to such a structure. In Lyubich's space, the\nstable sets of maps in the limit set of renormalization coincide with the very\nhybrid classes of such maps, and inherit a natural structure making them (complex codimension one) analytic submanifolds. Combining McMullen's rigidity\nof towers with Schwarz's lemma in Banach spaces, Lyubich proved exponential\ncontraction along such stable leaves. To obtain expansion in the transversal\ndirections to such leaves at points of the limit set, Lyubich argued by contradiction: if expansion fails, then one can find a map in the limit set whose orbit\nunder renormalization is slowly shadowed by another orbit (the small orbits\ntheorem, page 323 of [20]). This however contradicts another theorem of his,\nnamely the combinatorial rigidity theorem of [21]. It follows that the limit set\nis indeed hyperbolic in the space of germs. Based on this result of Lyubich and\nusing the real and complex bounds given by Sullivan, we prove in Theorem 2.4\nthat the attractor (for bounded combinatorics) is hyperbolic in a Banach space\nof real analytic maps.\nIn the present paper, we give the last step in the proof of the above renormalization conjecture in the (much larger) space of C r smooth unimodal maps\nwith r sufficiently large. The very formulation of the conjecture in this setting\nrequires some care, because the renormalization operator is not differentiable\nin C r . For the correct formulation, see Theorem 2.5 below. To prove the\nconjecture, we combine Theorem 2.4 with some nonlinear functional analysis\ninspired by the work of A. Davie [5]. In that work, Davie constructs the stable\nmanifold of the fixed point of the period doubling operator in the space of\nC 2+\u03b5 maps \"by hand\", showing it to be a C 1 codimension-one submanifold of\nthe ambient space, even though the operator is not differentiable. To do this,\nhe first extends the hyperbolic splitting of the derivative at the fixed point\nfrom Lanford's Banach space of real-analytic maps to the larger space of C 2+\u03b5\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n735\n\nmaps (to which the derivative extends as a bounded linear operator). This\ngives him an extended codimension-one stable subspace in C 2+\u03b5 to work with,\nand he views the local stable set in C 2+\u03b5 as the graph of a function over the\nextended stable subspace. In attempting to prove that such function is C 1 ,\nhe goes around the inherent loss of differentiability of renormalization by first\nnoting that the local unstable manifold coming from Lanford's theorem is still\nthere (and is still smooth in C 2+\u03b5 ) and then showing that there is afterall a\ncontraction in C 2+\u03b5 towards that unstable manifold, whose elements are analytic maps. Thus, the loss of differentiability is somehow compensated by\nthe contraction towards the unstable manifold. Davie's crucial estimates show\nthat the renormalization operator in C 2+\u03b5 is sufficiently well-approximated by\nthe extension of its derivative in Lanford's space to a bounded linear operator\nin C 2+\u03b5 .\nOur approach is based on the idea that whatever Davie can do with\nLanford's Banach space relative to the fixed point, we can do with the\nBanach space obtained in Theorem 2.4 relative to the whole limit set. There is\none fundamental difference, however. The linear and nonlinear estimates carried out by Davie rely on the special fact that the period-doubling fixed point\nis concave. This allows him to prove his main theorems in C 2+\u03b5 for all \u03b5 > 0.\nBy contrast, we cannot \u2013 and do not \u2013 rely on any such convexity assumptions.\nWe derive our estimates (in \u00a75 and \u00a78) directly from the geometric properties\nof the postcritical set of maps in the limit set (these properties \u2013 proved in \u00a75.2\n\u2013 are a consequence of the real a priori bounds). As a result, our local stable\nmanifold theorem in C r requires r \u2265 2 + \u03b1 with \u03b1 close to one.\nWe go beyond the conjecture in at least three respects. First, we show that\nthe local stable manifolds form a C 0 lamination whose holonomy is C 1+\u03b2 for\nsome \u03b2 > 0. In particular, every smooth curve which is transversal to such a\nlamination intersects it at a set of constant Hausdorff dimension less than one.\nSecond, we prove that the global stable sets are C 1 (immersed) codimensionone submanifolds in C r provided r \u2265 3 + \u03b1 with \u03b1 close to one (we globalize\nthe local stable manifolds via the implicit function theorem, hence the further\nloss of one degree of differentiability). Third, we prove that in an open and\ndense set of C k one-parameter families of C r unimodal maps (for any k \u2265 2),\neach family intersects the global stable lamination transversally at a Cantor\nset of parameters and the small-scale geometry of this intersection is the same\nfor all nearby families. In particular, its Hausdorff dimension is strictly smaller\nthan one.\nIn the path towards these results, we have made an attempt to abstract\nout the more general features of the renormalization operator in the form of\na few properties or \"axioms\" \u2013 the notion of a robust operator introduced in\nSection 6. We prove a general local stable manifold theorem for robust operators there. It is our hope that this might be useful in other renormalization\nproblems, for example in the case of critical circle maps (see [7] and [8]).\n\n\f736\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nAcknowledgement.

Here r can be either a\nnonnegative real number, say r = k + \u03b1 with k \u2208 N and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1, in which\ncase C r (I) is the space of C k functions whose kth derivative is \u03b1-H\u00f6lder, or else\nr = k + Lip, in which case C r (I) means the space of C k functions whose kth\nderivative is Lipschitz (so whenever we say that r is not an integer, we include\nthe Lipschitz cases). Let us denote by Ar the space Cer (I) consisting of all C r\nfunctions on I which are even and vanish at the origin, in other words\nAr = {v \u2208 C r (I) : v is even and v(0) = 0} .\nThen Ar is a closed linear subspace of C r (I) and therefore also a Banach space\nunder the C r norm. Now, for each r \u2265 2, define\nUr \u2282 1 + Ar \u2282 C r (I)\nto be the set of all maps f : I \u2192 I of the form f (x) = 1 + v(x), where v \u2208 Ar\nsatisfies v \u2032\u2032 (0) < 0, which are unimodal. Then Ur is a Banach manifold; indeed\nit is an open subset of the affine space 1 + Ar . Note that for all f \u2208 Ur the\ntangent space Tf Ur is naturally identified with Ar . The elements of Ur are\ncalled C r unimodal maps with a quadratic critical point.\n2.1.2. The Banach spaces Br . We define Br to be the space of functions\nv : I \u2192 R of the form v = \u03c6 \u25e6 q where q(x) = x2 and \u03c6 \u2208 C r ([0, 1]) vanishes\nat the origin. The norm of v in this space is given by the C r norm of \u03c6. This\nmakes Br into a Banach space. Note that for each s \u2264 r the inclusion map\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n737\n\nj : Br \u2192 As is linear and continuous (hence C 1 ). Now, for each r \u2265 1, let\nVr \u2282 1 + Br\nbe the open subset of the affine space 1 + Br consisting of those f = \u03c6 \u25e6 q such\nthat \u03c6([0, 1]) \u2286 (\u22121, 1], \u03c6(0) = 1 and \u03c6\u2032 (x) < 0 for all 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Just as\nbefore, Vr is a Banach manifold. Note that each f \u2208 Vr is a unimodal map\nbelonging to Ur when r \u2265 2. Moreover, the inclusion of Vr in Ur is strict (for\neach r \u2265 2).\n2.2. The renormalization operator. A map f \u2208 Ur is said to be renormalizable if there exist p = p(f ) > 1 and \u03bb = \u03bb(f ) = f p (0) such that f p|[\u2212|\u03bb|, |\u03bb|]\nis unimodal and maps [\u2212|\u03bb|, |\u03bb|] into itself. In this case, with the smallest\npossible value of p, the map Rf : [\u22121, 1] \u2192 [\u22121, 1] given by\n1 p\nf (\u03bbx)\n\u03bb\nis called the first renormalization of f . We have Rf \u2208 Ur . The intervals\nf j ([\u2212|\u03bb|, |\u03bb|]), for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 p \u2212 1, are pairwise disjoint and their relative order\ninside [\u22121, 1] determines a unimodal permutation \u03b8 of {0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1}. The\nset of all unimodal permutations is denoted P. The set of f \u2208 Ur that are\nrenormalizable with the same unimodal permutation \u03b8 \u2208 P is a connected\nsubset of Ur denoted Ur\u03b8 . Hence we have an operator\n[\n(2.2.2)\nR:\nUr\u03b8 \u2192 Ur ,\n(2.2.1)\n\nRf (x) =\n\n\u03b8\u2208P\n\nthe so-called renormalization operator.\nNow let us fix a finite subset \u0398 \u2286 P. Given an infinite sequence of\nunimodal permutations \u03b80 , \u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8n , * * * \u2208 \u0398, write\nUr\u03b80 ,\u03b81 ,*** ,\u03b8n ,*** = Ur\u03b80 \u2229 R\u22121 Ur\u03b81 \u2229 * * * \u2229 R\u2212n Ur\u03b8n \u2229 * * * ,\n\nand define\nr\nD\u0398\n=\n\n[\n\nUr\u03b80 ,\u03b81 ,*** ,\u03b8n ,*** .\n\n(\u03b80 ,\u03b81 ,*** ,\u03b8n ,*** )\u2208\u0398N\nr are infinitely renormalizable maps with (bounded) combinaThe maps in D\u0398\nr ) \u2286 D r ; in fact,\ntorics belonging to \u0398.

Hence, taking Vr\u03b8 = Ur\u03b8 \u2229 Vr , the restriction of the renormalization\noperator\n[\n(2.2.4)\nR:\nVr\u03b8 \u2192 Vr\n\u03b8\u2208P\n\nis well-defined.\n\n\f738\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\n2.3. The limit sets of renormalization. In [28], Sullivan established the existence of horseshoe-like invariant sets for the renormalization operator, showing that they all consist of real analytic maps of a special kind, namely, restrictions to [\u22121, 1] of quadratic-like maps in the sense of Douady-Hubbard.\nWe remind the reader that a quadratic-like map f : V \u2192 W is a holomorphic\nmap with the property that V and W are topological disks with V compactly\ncontained in W , and f is a proper, degree two branched covering map with a\ncontinuous extension to the boundary of V . The conformal modulus of f is\nthe modulus of the annulus W \\ V .\nWe are interested only in quadratic-like maps that commute with complex\nconjugation, for which V is symmetric about the real axis. Consider the real\nBanach space H0 (V ) of holomorphic functions which commute with complex\nconjugation and are continuous up to the boundary of V , with the C 0 norm.\nLet AV \u2282 H0 (V ) be the closed linear subspace of functions of the form \u03c6 = \u03c6\u25e6q,\nwhere q(z) = z 2 and \u03c6 : q(V ) \u2192 C is holomorphic with \u03c6(0) = 0. Also, let\nUV be the set of functions of the form f = 1 + \u03c6, where \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 q \u2208 AV and\n\u03c6 is univalent on some neighborhood of [\u22121, 1] contained in V , such that the\nrestriction of f to [\u22121, 1] is unimodal. Then UV is an open subset of the affine\nspace 1 + AV , which is linearly isomorphic to AV via the translation by 1,\nand we shall regard UV as an open subset of AV itself via this identification.\nFor each a > 0, let us denote by \u03a9a the set of points in the complex plane\nwhose distance from the interval [\u22121, 1] is smaller than a. We may now state\nSullivan's theorem as follows.\nTheorem 2.1. Let \u0398 \u2286 P be a nonempty finite set. Then there exist\n\u03c9 and \u03bc > 0 with the following\na > 0, a compact subset K = K\u0398 \u2286 A\u03a9a \u2229 D\u0398\nproperties.\n(i) Each f \u2208 K has a quadratic-like extension with conformal modulus bounded from below by \u03bc.\n(ii) R(K) \u2286 K, and the restriction of R to K is a homeomorphism which\nis topologically conjugate to the two-sided shift \u03c3 : \u0398Z \u2192 \u0398Z : in other\nwords, there exists a homeomorphism H : K \u2192 \u0398Z such that the diagram\nR\n\nK \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nHy\n\nK\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\nyH\n\n\u0398Z \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 \u0398Z\n\ncommutes.\n\n\u03c3\n\nr \u2229 Vr , with r \u2265 2, there exists f \u2208 K with the property that\n(iii) For all g \u2208 D\u0398\nn\nn\n||R (g) \u2212 R (f )||C 0 (I) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nFor a detailed exposition of this theorem, see Chapter VI of [26].\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n739\n\nLater, in [23], C. McMullen established the exponential convergence of\nrenormalization for bounded combinatorics (using rigidity of towers). His theorem forms the basis for the contracting part of Lyubich's hyperbolicity theorem\nin [20].\nTheorem 2.2. If f and g are infinitely renormalizable quadratic-like maps\nwith the same bounded combinatorial type in \u0398 \u2282 P , and with conformal moduli\ngreater than or equal to \u03bc, then\nkRn f \u2212 Rn gkC 0 (I) \u2264 C\u03bbn\nfor all n \u2265 0 where C = C(\u03bc, \u0398) > 0 and 0 < \u03bb = \u03bb(\u0398) < 1.\nThe above result was extended by Lyubich to all combinatorics. In particular it follows, in the case of bounded combinatorics, that the exponent \u03bb\nand the constant C in Theorem 2 do not depend on \u0398. The conclusion of the\nabove theorem can also be improved in bounded combinatorics: for r \u2265 3; the\nexponential convergence holds in the C r topology if the maps are in Vr (see\n[24] and [25]).\nIn [20], Lyubich considered the space of quadratic-like germs modulo affine\nconjugacies in which the limit set K is naturally embedded. This space is a\nmanifold modeled on a complex topological vector space (arising as a direct\nlimit of Banach spaces of holomorphic maps). In this setting, Lyubich established in [8] the full hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator. With the\nhelp of Sullivan's real and complex bounds and Lyubich's theorem we prove\nthe hyperbolicity of some iterate of the renormalization operator acting on a\nspace A\u03a9a for some a > 0 (see Theorem 2.4 in \u00a72.5). Then we extend Davie's\nanalysis for the Feigenbaum fixed point to the context of bounded combinatorics to conclude that the hyperbolic picture also holds true in the much larger\nspace Ur (see Theorem 2.5 in \u00a72.5).\n2.4. Hyperbolic basic sets. We need to introduce the well-known concept\nof hyperbolic basic set for nonlinear operators acting on Banach spaces. Let\nus consider a Banach space A, and an open subset O \u2286 A.\nDefinition 2.1. Let T : O \u2192 A be a smooth nonlinear operator. A hyperbolic basic set of T is a compact subset K \u2282 O with the following properties.\n(i) K is T -invariant and T |K is a topologically transitive homeomorphism\nwhose periodic points are dense.\n(ii) If y \u2208 O and all T -iterates of y are defined, then T n (y) converges to K.\nL u\n(iii) There exist a continuous, DT -invariant splitting A = Exs\nEx , for\nx \u2208 K, and uniform constants C > 0 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1 such that\nkDT n (x) vk \u2264 C\u03b8 nkvk\n\n\f740\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nfor all v \u2208 Exs , as well as\nkDT n (x) vk \u2265 C\u03b8 \u2212nkvk\n\n(2.4.1)\nfor all v \u2208 Exu .\n\n(iv) The dimension of Exu is finite and constant.\nThe following notions are also standard. Let A(x, \u03b5) be the ball in A with\ncenter x and radius \u03b5. The local stable manifold W\u03b5s (x) of T at x consists of\nall points y \u2208 A(x, \u03b5) such that, for all n > 0, we have T n (y) \u2208 A(T n (x), \u03b5)\nand\nkT n (y) \u2212 T n (x)k \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e .\nThe local unstable manifold W\u03b5u (x) of T at x consists of all points y \u2208 A(x, \u03b5)\nsuch that, when y0 = y, for all n \u2265 1 there exists yn \u2208 A(T \u2212n (x), \u03b5) such that\nyn\u22121 = T (yn ) and\nkT \u2212n (x) \u2212 yn k \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e .\nFinally the global stable set of T at x is defined as\nW s (x) = {y \u2208 O : kT n (y) \u2212 T n (x)k \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e} .\nThe question arises as to whether these sets have smooth manifold structures.\nWe have the following general result.\nTheorem 2.3. If K is a hyperbolic basic set of a C 1 operator T : O \u2192 A\nthen\n(i) the local stable (resp. unstable) set at x \u2208 K is a C 1 Banach submanifold\nof A which is tangent to Exs (resp. Exu ) at x.\n(ii) If y \u2208 W s (x) then\nkT n (x) \u2212 T n (y)k \u2264 C\u03b8 n kx \u2212 yk .\nMoreover, T (W\u03b5u (x)) \u2287 W\u03b5u (T (x)), the restriction of T to W\u03b5u (x) is oneto-one and for all y \u2208 W\u03b5u (x),\nT \u2212n (x) \u2212 T \u2212n (y) \u2264 C\u03b8 n kx \u2212 yk .\n(iii) If y \u2208 A(x, \u03b5) is such that T i (y) \u2208 A(T i (x), \u03b5) for i \u2264 n then\ndist (T n (y), W\u03b5u (T n (x))) \u2264 C\u03b8 n , as well as dist (y, W\u03b5s (x)) \u2264 C\u03b8 n .\n(iv) The family of local stable manifolds (and also the family of local unstable\nmanifolds) form a C 0 lamination: the tangent spaces to the leaves vary\ncontinuously.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n741\n\nWe do not prove this theorem here since we will not use it, but instead\nmake the following comments. Using the arguments of Hirsch-Pugh in [14], we\ncan prove that the local unstable set is a smooth manifold. The local stable\nset is also a smooth manifold, but a different proof is needed: one can use the\nideas of Irwin in [16]. See also Theorem 2.1 on page 375 of [27]. In both cases\nthe smoothness can be improved to C k if the operator T is C k .\nFor invertible operators the global stable set is also a smooth submanifold.\nIn the noninvertible situation, this is not always true. However, we will prove\nin \u00a79.1 that this is the case for the renormalization operator acting on Vr ,\nprovided r \u2265 3 + \u03b1 and \u03b1 > 0 is close to one.\n2.5. Hyperbolicity of renormalization. In the present paper we prove three\nmain theorems. The first main theorem shows that there exists a real Banach\nspace of analytic maps, containing the topological limit set K of renormalization, on which the renormalization operator R acts as a real-analytic operator\nand has K as a hyperbolic basic set. More precisely, we have the following\nresult.\nTheorem 2.4 (Hyperbolicity in a real Banach space). There exist a > 0,\nan open set O \u2282 A = A\u03a9a containing K = K\u0398 and a positive integer N with the\nfollowing property. There exists a real analytic operator T : O \u2192 A having K\nas a hyperbolic basic set with codimension-one stable manifolds at each point,\nsuch that T (f )|[\u22121, 1] = RN (f |[\u22121, 1]), for all f \u2208 O, is the N th iterate of the\nrenormalization operator.\nThe proof of this theorem, presented in \u00a73 (see Theorem 3.9), combines\nLyubich's hyperbolicity results with Sullivan's real and complex bounds.\nThe second main theorem establishes the \"hyperbolicity\" of renormalization in Ur . As we have mentioned before, the renormalization operator is not\nsmooth in Ur , so the definition of hyperbolicity of an invariant set does not\neven make sense. However, the hyperbolic picture holds in this situation. More\nprecisely, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 2.5 (Hyperbolic Picture in Ur ). If r \u2265 2 + \u03b1, where \u03b1 > 0 is\nclose to one, then statements (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 2.3 hold true\nfor the renormalization operator acting on Ur . Furthermore,\n(i) the local unstable manifolds are real analytic curves;\n(ii) the local stable manifolds are of class C 1 , and together they form a continuous lamination whose holonomy is C 1+\u03b2 for some \u03b2 > 0.\nThe main difficulty behind the proof of this theorem is the fact that the\noperator T is not Fr\u00e9chet differentiable in C r (in fact it is only continuous in\n\n\f742\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\na dense subset of Ur ). However, as we shall see in \u00a78.2, it is a C 1 mapping\nfrom its domain in Ur into Us if s < r \u2212 1 (even for s = r \u2212 1 if r is an\ninteger). Hence its tangent map defines a continuous map L : K \u00d7 Ar \u2192 K \u00d7 As\nby L(g, v) = (T (g), DT (g)(v)) = (T (g), Lg (v)). The bounded linear mappings\nLg : Ar \u2192 As extend to bounded linear operators Lg : At \u2192 At for all 0 \u2264 t \u2264 r.\nAlthough Lg is not the derivative of T at g in C r , it is nevertheless a sufficiently\ngood linear approximation to T near g (see the properties of Definition 6.1,\nchecked in \u00a78).\nCorollary 2.6 (Hyperbolic Picture in Vr ). If r \u2265 2 + \u03b1, where \u03b1 > 0\nis close to one, then statements (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 2.3 hold true\nfor the renormalization operator acting on Vr . Furthermore,\n(i) the local unstable manifolds are real analytic curves;\n(ii) the local stable manifolds are of class C 1 , and together they form a continuous lamination whose holonomy is C 1+\u03b2 for some \u03b2 > 0.\nFor the proofs of Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6, see Section 8.\nBy an argument using the implicit function theorem and the results in\n[24], which a priori are valid only in Vr , we shall prove in Section 9 our third\nmain theorem, which we state as follows.\nTheorem 2.7. If r \u2265 3+\u03b1, where \u03b1 > 0 is close to one, then the following\nassertions hold true for the renormalization operator acting in Vr :\n(i) The global stable sets are C 1 immersed submanifolds.\n(ii) For each integer 2 \u2264 k \u2264 r, there exists an open dense set of C k oneparameter families of maps in Vr all of whose elements intersect the\nglobal stable lamination of (T, K\u0398 ) transversally.\n(iii) In each such family, the set of parameters where the intersections occur\nis a Cantor set which is locally C 1+\u03b2 diffeomorphic to the corresponding\nCantor set of the quadratic family. In particular, its Hausdorff dimension\nis a universal number depending only on \u0398 which lies strictly between zero\nand one if \u0398 has more than one element.\nIt is worth emphasizing that when a generic family (in the sense of the\nabove corollary) intersects the stable lamination at a point, then any neighborhood of this point in parameter space contains a renormalization window\nthat is mapped under a suitable power of the renormalization operator onto a\nfull transversal family.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n743\n\n3. Hyperbolicity in a Banach space of real analytic maps\nIn this section we give a proof of Theorem 2.4. Using the real and complex\nbounds given by Sullivan in [28], we prove in \u00a73.1 that there is an iterate of the\nrenormalization operator which extends as a real analytic map T to an open set\nO\u03a9a of the Banach space A\u03a9a consisting of real analytic maps whose domain\nis an a-neighborhood of the interval [\u22121, 1], for a suitable a > 0. The maps\ng \u2208 K have unique extensions belonging to O\u03a9a . In \u00a73.2, using Lemmas 4.16\nand 4.17 in Lyubich's paper [20], we show that the hybrid conjugacy classes\nof the maps g \u2208 K form a continuous lamination of codimension one real\nanalytic manifolds. Then in \u00a73.4 we construct a skew-product renormalization\noperator that satisfies properties (W1) to (W4) on page 395 of [20] in the\nreal-analytic case (restated in \u00a73.5). By Theorems 8.2 and 8.8 in [20] the\nskew-product renormalization operator will have fiberwise stable and unstable\nleaves (as defined in \u00a73.3). The local stable leaf at g \u2208 K is a relatively\nopen set of the hybrid conjugacy class of g. Then using the skew-product\nrenormalization operator, we prove in \u00a73.5 that K is a basic set for the real\nanalytic renormalization operator T : O\u03a9a \u2192 A\u03a9a .\n3.1. Real analyticity of the renormalization operator. Using Sullivan's real\nand complex bounds in [28], we will show that there exists a > 0 such that\nsome iterate T : O\u03a9a \u2192 A\u03a9a of the renormalization operator is a (well-defined)\nreal analytic operator with a compact derivative.\nFor each f \u2208 K, let If \u2286 [\u22121, 1] be the postcritical set of f (the Cantor\nattractor of f ).

Recall that Og,N = \u039bg (Ug,N ). By\na continuity argument, there is \u03b4g > 0 such that for every f \u2208 A\u03a9\u03b1 (g, \u03b4g ),\nthe restriction f |[\u22121, 1] is N -times renormalizable, f j (\u039bf (Ug,N )) \u2282 \u03a9\u03b1/2 for\nevery 0 \u2264 j \u2264 p = p(N, f ), and moreover f p : \u039bf (Ug,N ) \u2192 f p (\u039bf (Ug,N )) is a\nquadratic-like map with conformal modulus greater than \u03bc/2.

The Beltrami differential \u03bch of h is given by \u03bch = \u2202h/\u2202h. A\nquasiconformal map h is K quasiconformal if K \u2265 (1 + ||\u03bch ||\u221e )/(1 \u2212 ||\u03bch ||\u221e ).\nTwo quadratic-like maps f and g are hybrid conjugate if there is a quasiconformal conjugacy h between f and g with the property that \u2202h(z) = 0 for\nalmost every z \u2208 Kf . Let us denote by H(f ) the hybrid conjugacy class of f .\nBy a slight abuse of notation, we will denote by K \u2229 AV (g, \u03b4) the set of\nmaps f \u2208 AV (g, \u03b4) with the property that f |[\u22121, 1] belongs to K.\nIn the proof of the following theorem, we will need to work with the complexification of AV . Let AV,C be the complex Banach space of all holomorphic\nmaps f : V \u2192 C with a continuous extension to the boundary of V . Let\nAV,C (f, \u03b4) be the open ball in AV,C centered in f and with radius \u03b4 > 0. Let\nC : AV,C \u2192 AV,C be the conjugation operator given by C(f ) = c \u25e6 f \u25e6 c, where\nc(z) = z \u2208 C. We note that f \u2208 AV if and only if f \u2208 AV,C and C(f ) = f .\nTheorem 3.3. For every g \u2208 K, there exists a symmetric neighborhood V\u0302g\nof the reals such that g has a quadratic-like extension to V\u0302g (also denoted by g),\nV\u0302g contains a definite neighborhood of Kg and for every neighborhood V \u2282 V\u0302g\nsymmetric with respect to R and with the property that g|V is a quadratic-like\nmap, there is \u03b4g,V > 0 such that for all f \u2208 K \u2229 AV (g, \u03b4g,V ),\nHV (f ) = H(f ) \u2229 AV (g, \u03b4g,V )\nare codimension-one, real-analytic leaves varying continuously with f .\nProof. By Lemmas 4.16 and 4.17 on page 354 of Lyubich's paper [20],\nwe obtain that for all f \u2208 K \u2229 AV,C (g, \u03b4g,V ), HV,C (f ) = H(f ) \u2229 AV,C (g, \u03b4g,V )\nare codimension-one complex analytic leaves varying continuously with f . If\nf \u2208 AV (g, \u03b4g,V ) then the hybrid conjugacy class of f in AV,C (g, \u03b4g,V ) is invariant\nunder the conjugation operator C. Hence, the tangent space Tf HV,C (f ) at\nf to its hybrid conjugacy class is invariant under the conjugation operator\nC, and there is a one-dimensional transversal Ef to Tf HV,C (f ) which is also\ninvariant under the conjugation operator C. Locally HV,C (f ) is a graph of\nG : Z \u2282 Tf HV,C (f ) \u2192 Ef with the property that if h = v + G(v) then C(h) =\nC(v) + G(C(v)). Thus, locally HV (f ) is also the graph of G|Z \u2229 AV (g, \u03b4g,V ),\nand so it is a codimension-one, real-analytic leaf. Since the complex-analytic\nleaves HV,C (f ) vary continuously with f , we deduce that the real-analytic\nleaves HV (f ) also vary continuously with f .\n\n\f747\n\nGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n3.3. Hyperbolic skew-products. Before going further, we pause for a moment to introduce the elementary concept of hyperbolic skew product in an\nabstract setting. Let K be a compact metric space and assume that K is totally disconnected. Let F be a finite collection of (real) Banach spaces, say\nF = {A1 , A2 , . . . , AN }, and assume we have a locally constant map \u03c6 : K \u2192 F.\nWe write Ax = \u03c6(x) \u2208 F, for all x \u2208 K. Let E = \u222ax\u2208K {x} \u00d7 Ax . We endow\nE with a topology as follows. If Ki = \u03c6\u22121 (Ai ), then Ki is an open and closed\nset in K, for each i = 1, 2, . . . , N . Note that E is the disjoint union of Ki \u00d7 Ai ,\ni = 1, 2, . . . , N . Hence endow each factor Ki \u00d7 Ai with the product topology\nand then E with the union topology. It is clear that E is metrizable also. The\nnatural projection E \u2192 K is open and continuous. We shall assume that there\nexists a continuous injection Ki \u2192 Ai for each i, and will accordingly identify\neach x \u2208 Ki with its image in Ai .\nNow suppose T : K \u2192 K is a homeomorphism (in the case we are interested, T is transitive), and also that for each x \u2208 K we have a real-analytic\nmap Sx : Ax (x, \u03b4) \u2192 AT (x) , where Ax (x, \u03b4) = {x + v \u2208 Ax : kvkAx < \u03b4}. We\ndefine a skew-product operator S : E(\u03b4) \u2192 E over T , where\nE(\u03b4) = {(x, y) : x \u2208 K, y \u2208 Ax , ky \u2212 xkAx < \u03b4} ,\nby S(x, y) = (T (x), Sx (y)).\nDefinition 3.2. We say that S is fiberwise hyperbolic if there exists a conL u\ntinuous splitting Ax = Exs\nEx with dim Exu = 1 which is invariant in the\nsense that DSx (Exs ) \u2286 ETs (x) and DSx (Exu ) \u2286 ETu (x) , satisfying for all v s \u2208 Exs\nand all v u \u2208 Exu the inequalities\n\u0001\nD ST n\u22121 (x) \u25e6 . . .

The fiberwise local stable manifold W\u03b2s (x) of S at x consists\nof all points y \u2208 Ax (x, \u03b2) such that for all n \u2265 1, we have ST n\u22121 (x) \u25e6* * *\u25e6Sx (y) \u2208\nAT n (x) (T n (x), \u03b2) and\nST n\u22121 (x) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 Sx (y) \u2212 ST n\u22121 (x) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 Sx (x)\n\nAT n (x)\n\n\u2264 C\u03b8 n\n\nwhere C > 0 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1 are uniform constants on x \u2208 K.

Skew-product renormalization operator. Our goal in this section is to\nbuild a skew-product renormalization operator that will play a central role in\nthe proof that K is a basic set for T : O\u03a9a \u2192 A\u03a9a , for a suitable a > 0. Our\n\n\f748\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nskew-product is constructed so as to satisfy properties (W1) to (W4) on page\n395 of [20] in the real analytic case \u2013 restated in \u00a73.5 \u2013 and therefore will have\nfiberwise stable and unstable manifolds, as we will explain in that section.\nUsing Theorem 3.1 and (3.1.3), we know that for every 0 < \u03b1 < b, K injects\ncontinuously into A\u03a9\u03b1 . Hence for f, g \u2208 K we define distK (f, g) = kf \u2212 gkA\u03a9\u03b1 .\nWe also denote by K(g, \u03b5) the ball of radius \u03b5 centered at g in this metric. The\nmetric is compatible with the natural topology of K, independently of which\n\u03b1 we take.\nLemma 3.4. The filled-in Julia set Kg varies continuously in the\nHausdorff metric with respect to g \u2208 K.\nProof. We need to show that for every \u03b5 > 0 there exists \u03b4 > 0 such\nthat if distK (f, g) < \u03b4 then (a) Kg \u2282 \u03a9\u03b5 (Kf ) and (b) Kf \u2282 \u03a9\u03b5 (Kg ). Let U =\nUR\u2212N0 (g),N0 \u2282 C be the symmetric neighborhood of [\u22121, 1] given by Lemma\n3.2. Since the operator TR\u2212N0 (g),N0 is continuous, every f \u2208 K sufficiently close\nto g in A\u03a9\u03b5 is quadratic-like on U (f = TR\u2212N0 (g),N0 (T \u22121 (f )) : U \u2192 C ) and is\nalso close to g in AU .\nTo prove (a), cover Kg by finitely many disks D(zi (g), \u03b5/2), i = 1, 2, . . . , m,\nwhere each zi (g) is an expanding periodic point of g. For f sufficiently close\nto g, the corresponding periodic points zi (f ) \u2208 D(zi (g), \u03b5/2). Hence each\nz \u2208 Kg is at distance at most \u03b5 from some zi (f ), which proves (a).\nTo prove (b), let n > 0 be so large that W = g\u2212n (U ) \u2282 \u03a9\u03b5 (Kg ). Since f\nis close to g and W \u2286 U is symmetric f : W \u2192 f (W ) is quadratic-like also,\nwhence Kf \u2282 W \u2282 \u03a9\u03b5 (Kg ) and so (b) is proved.\nLemma 3.5. Let g \u2208 K and let V \u2282 C be a symmetric neighborhood of\n[\u22121, 1] which is compactly contained in \u03a9b/2 (Kg ), where b is given by (3.1.3).\nThen for all \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small K \u2229 AV (g, \u03b5) is an open subset of K.\nProof. Take 0 < \u03b1 < b sufficiently small such that \u03a9\u03b1 is compactly\ncontained in V . By Theorem 3.1 and (3.1.3), every f \u2208 K is well-defined on\n\u03a9b (Kf ). Since by Lemma 3.4 the map f 7\u2192 Kf is continuous in the Hausdorff\nmetric, there exists \u03b50 > 0 such that if f \u2208 K is such that distK (f, g) < \u03b50\nthen \u03a9b/2 (Kg ) \u2282 \u03a9b (Kf ). Since V \u2282 \u03a9b/2 (Kg ), it follows that f is well-defined\non V , that is, f \u2208 AV . Hence there is a well-defined injection K(g, \u03b50 ) \u2192 AV .\nSuch injection is continuous. Indeed, for f \u2208 K(g, \u03b50 ), the C 0 norm of f in\n\u03a9b/2 (Kg ) is uniformly bounded, while kf kA\u03a9\u03b1 varies continuously with f . Since\n\u03a9\u03b1 \u2282 V \u2282 V \u2282 \u03a9b/2 (Kg ), we deduce from Hadamard's three circles theorem\n(see Lemma 11.5 on page 415 of [20]) that kf kAV varies continuously with f\nalso. Therefore the map K(g, \u03b50 ) \u2192 AV is continuous as asserted. Now let\nf \u2208 K \u2229 AV (g, \u03b50 ). Since the inclusion AV \u2192 A\u03a9\u03b1 has Lipschitz constant one,\nwe have that f \u2208 K(g, \u03b50 ). Hence, by continuity of the map K(g, \u03b50 ) \u2192 AV ,\n\n\f749\n\nGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\nthere exists \u03b51 > 0 such that K(f, \u03b51 ) \u2286 K \u2229 AV (g, \u03b50 ), which shows that this\nlast set is open in K. This completes the proof.\nLemma 3.6. Let b > 0 be as defined in (3.1.3) and \u03b40 > 0 as in Lemma\n3.2. There exist \u03bd > 0, 0 < \u03b4 < \u03b40 , a finite set V of symmetric neighborhoods\nof [\u22121, 1] and a locally constant map K \u220b g 7\u2192 Vg \u2208 V with the following\nproperties:\n(i) The neighborhood Vg is compactly contained in \u03a9b/2 (Kg );\n(ii) Every f \u2208 AVg (g, \u03b4) is a quadratic-like map with conformal modulus\nlarger than \u03bd;\n(iii) If f \u2208 K \u2229 AVg (g, \u03b4) then H(f ) \u2229 AVg (g, \u03b4) is a codimension-one, realanalytic submanifold varying continuously with f .\nProof. For every g \u2208 K, let Ug \u2282 C be a symmetric neighborood of [\u22121, 1]\nwhere g is quadratic-like, and take ng > 0 so large that Vg\u2032 = g\u2212ng (Ug ) \u2282\n\u03a9b/3 (Kg ) and Vg\u2032 \u2286 V\u0302g , where V\u0302g is as given in Theorem 3.3.\nLet \u03b4g > 0 be so small that each f \u2208 AVg\u2032 (g, \u03b4g ) is quadratic-like in Vg\u2032 with\nconformal modulus greater than \u03bdg > 0 and also so that Theorem 3.3 holds\ntrue (for Vg\u2032 and \u03b4g ). By Lemma 3.4, making \u03b4g smaller if necessary, we see\nthat Vg\u2032 = g\u2212ng (Ug ) \u2282 \u03a9b/2 (Kf ) for all f \u2208 K \u2229 AVg\u2032 (g, \u03b4g ).\nBy Lemma 3.5, each set K\u2229AVg\u2032 (g, \u03b4g /2) is open in K. Since K is compact,\nthere exists a finite set {gi : i = 1, . . . , l} such that\nK\u2282\n\nl\n[\n\nAVg\u2032i (gi , \u03b4gi /2) .\n\ni=1\n\nThus we can set\n\b\nV = Vg\u2032i : i = 1, . . . , l , \u03b4 = min {\u03b4gi /2}\ni=1,...,l\n\nand\n\n\u03bd = min {\u03bdgi } .\ni=1,...,l\n\nTherefore, since K is totally disconnected, there exists a locally constant map\nK \u220b g 7\u2192 Vg \u2208 V so that properties (i), (ii) and (iii) are satisfied.\nWe are now in a position to define the skew-product renormalization operator. This is accomplished in our next lemma.

The proof is similar to the proof of Lemma 3.2 (ii).\n3.5. Hyperbolicity of the renormalization operator. The purpose of this section is to show that K is a hyperbolic basic set for the operator T : O\u03a9a \u2192 A\u03a9a .\nThis will follow from the fact (Lemma 3.8 below) that the skew-product renormalization operator has fiberwise real analytic stable manifolds and fiberwise\none dimensional real analytic unstable manifolds.\nWe start by noting that our skew-product operator satisfies the conditions\nW1\u2013W4 on page 395 of Lyubich [20] in the real analytic case. Namely, we have\nW1. The conformal modulus of each g \u2208 K is larger than a uniform constant\n\u03bc > 0.\nW2. There exists \u03b7 > 0 such that if distK (f, g) < \u03b7 for some f, g \u2208 K, then\nAVf = AVg .\nW3. There exists \u03b4 > 0 such that Sg (AVg (g, \u03b4)) \u2286 AVT (g) .\nW4. The vertical fibers Zg (consisting of those normalized symmetric\nquadratic-like germs whose external class is the same as that of g) sit\nlocally in AVg for each g \u2208 K.\nCondition W1 is satisfied because of the complex bounds (Theorem 3.1).\nCondition W2 follows from Lemma 3.6. Condition W3 holds by the construction of Sg in Lemma 3.7. Condition W4 is a consequence of Lemma 3.6 (iii).\nNow we have the following result.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n751\n\nLemma 3.8. The skew-product renormalization operator S : E(\u03b4) \u2192 E\ndefined in Lemma 3.7 is fiberwise hyperbolic. Moreover\n(i) The local stable set W\u03b4s (g) of S at g is a codimension-one submanifold of\nAVg which is relatively open in H(g) \u2229 AVg (g, \u03b4), and W\u03b4s (g) is tangent to\nEgs at g.\n(ii) The local unstable set W\u03b4u (g) \u2282 AVg of S at g is a one-dimensional,\nreal-analytic manifold, and {g} \u00d7 W\u03b4u (g) varies continuously with g \u2208 A\nin E.\nProof. Since the operator S satisfies Lyubich's conditions W1\u2013W4 stated\nabove, part (i) follows from Theorem 8.2 on page 392 of [20] and Theorem 3.3,\nand part (ii) follows from Theorem 8.8 on page 398 of Lyubich's paper [20].\nTheorem 3.9. Let T : O\u03a9a \u2192 A\u03a9a be the real analytic operator defined\nin Lemma 3.7. Then there is a continuous, DT -invariant splitting A\u03a9a =\nL\nEgs Egu , for g \u2208 K, such that if v u \u2208 Egu and v s \u2208 Egs then\n(3.5.1)\n\nkDT n (g)v u kA\u03a9a \u2265 C \u22121 \u03b8 \u2212n kv u kA\u03a9a ,\n\n(3.5.2)\n\nkDT n (g)v s kA\u03a9a \u2264 C\u03b8 n kv s kA\u03a9a ,\n\nwhere C > 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1 are uniform constants on g.\nProof. Since for every g \u2208 K the map kg : AVg \u2192 A\u03a9a is linear and\ninjective, it follows from Lemma 3.8 (ii) that Zgu = kg (W\u03b4u (g)) is a real-analytic,\none-dimensional manifold varying continuously with g. Let wg be the unitary\nvector tangent to W\u03b4u (g) at g. Then vg = kg (wg ) is a vector tangent to Zgu at\ng and also varies continuously with g. Since kg and kT (g) are linear maps we\nsee from (3.4.1) that if \u03bbg is such that DSg (g)wg = \u03bbg wT (g) then DT (g)vg =\n\u03bbg vT (g) . Thus a natural candidate for Egu is the one-dimensional linear subspace\ngenerated by vg . In particular, (3.5.1) is satisfied.\nLet us find the natural candidate for Egs . We have that DTg (g)vg = wT (g)\nand by hypothesis wT (g) is transversal to the tangent space of W\u03b4s (T (g)). Thus,\nby the implicit function theorem Zgs = Tg\u22121 (W\u03b4s (T g)) is a codimension-one\nmanifold transversal to Zgu . Taking Egs equal to the tangent space of Zgs , we\nL u\nobtain that Egs\nEg = A\u03a9a . By (3.4.1), we have that a neighborhood of\nT (g) intersected with ZTu (g) is contained in T (Zgu ) and a neighborhood of T (g)\nintersected with T (Zgs ) is contained in ZTs (g) , which implies that the splitting\nL\nEgs Egu is invariant under DT . From assertion (i) in Lemma 3.8, we obtain\nL u\nthat Egs varies continuously with g and so the splitting Egs\nEg also varies\ncontinuously with g.\nFinally, let M > 0 be such that kDTg (g)kA\u03a9a \u2264 M and note that kkg kA\u03a9a \u2264 1\nfor all g \u2208 K. For all v s \u2208 Egs with unit norm, let us = DTg (g)v s \u2208 AVT (g) . By\n\n\f752\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nLemma 3.8 (i) and (3.4.1) there exists C1 > 1 and 0 < \u03b8 < 1 such that\nkDT n (g)v s kA\u03a9a = kkT n (g) \u25e6 DST n\u22121 (g) (T n\u22121 (g)) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 DST (g) (T (g))us kA\u03a9a\n\u2264 kDST n\u22121 (g) (T n\u22121 (g)) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 DST (g) (T (g))us kAVT n (g)\n\u2264 C1 M \u03b8 n\u22121 ,\nwhich shows that (3.5.2) is satisfied. This completes the proof.\nWith the above results, we have therefore established Theorem 2.4, to the\neffect that a suitable power of the renormalization operator is indeed hyperbolic\nin a suitable (real) Banach space of real analytic mappings. From now on, we\nshall concentrate on the problem of extending such hyperbolicity to larger\nambient spaces of smooth mappings. Our journey will take us far into the\nwilderness of nonlinear functional analysis.\n4. Extending invariant splittings\nIn this section we prove a certain result from functional analysis (Theorem\n4.1 below) that is absolutely crucial for the stable manifold theorem that we\nshall prove later. This result deals with the notion of compatibility presented\nbelow and is a strong generalization of a key idea of Davie in [5]. In Section 5,\nwe shall use the results presented here to show that the invariant splitting for\nthe renormalization operator T in A\u03a9a of Section 3 extends to an invariant\nsplitting for the action of T in the larger spaces Ar of C r maps.\n4.1. Compatibility. We are interested in the answer to the following question. Given a smooth operator T : O \u2192 A having a hyperbolic basic set K,\nand given a larger ambient space B \u2287 A to which T extends (not necessarily\nsmoothly), under which conditions does K have a hyperbolic structure in B?\nTo give a precise meaning to this question (and then answer it!) we introduce\nthe following notion.\nWe have a natural continuous map L : K \u2192 L(A, A) given by\nK \u220b x 7\u2192 Lx : A \u2192 A\nLx (v) = DT (x) v .\nWe will also assume that for every x \u2208 K, Exu is a one-dimensional subspace\nand that we can chose a unit vector ux \u2208 Exu varying continuously with x\nso that Lx (ux ) = \u03b4x * uT (x) with \u03b4x > 0. In the case of the renormalization\noperator there is a natural choice for the vectors ux : choose the unit vector\npointing in the direction of increasing topological entropy.\n(n)\nFor every x \u2208 K, we denote DT n (x) = LT n\u22121 (x) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 Lx by Lx and\n(n)\n\n\u03b4T n\u22121 (x) * * * \u03b4x by \u03b4x .

Let \u03b8 < \u03c1 < \u03bb where \u03b8 is the contraction exponent of the\nhyperbolic basic set K of the operator T and \u03bb is as in (4.1.1).

As we know from Theorem 2.4, K is a hyperbolic basic set\nof the renormalization operator T = RN : O \u2192 A. In Section 5 (see Theorem\n5.1), we will show that the pair (Ar , A0 ) is \u03c1-compatible for r sufficiently close\nto 2 and 1-compatible for r > 2 noninteger.\nLet \u03c0xu : A \u2192 Exu and \u03c0xs : A \u2192 Exs be the canonical projections.

Extending the invariant splitting for renormalization\nOur aim in this section is to show that the invariant splitting on the\nlimit set K of the operator T given by Theorem 2.4, which is an iterate of\nthe renormalization operator, can be extended to an invariant splitting of the\nsame operator acting in the space of C r unimodal maps. Given the abstract\nresults of the previous section, namely Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.2, all we\nhave to do is find the appropriate compatible spaces and the corresponding\ncompatibility constants. More precisely, we shall prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.1. Let T and K be as above, and let \u03bb be the expansion constant satisfying (4.1.1).\n(i) For all \u03b1 > 0 the pair of spaces (A2+\u03b1 , A0 ) is 1-compatible with (T, K).\n(ii) For all 1 < \u03c1 < \u03bb there exists \u03b1 > 0 sufficiently small such that\n(A2\u2212\u03b1 , A0 ) is \u03c1-compatible with (T, K).\nThe path towards the proof of this theorem (presented in \u00a75.3) leads us\nto perform what amounts to a spectral analysis of the formal derivative of\nthe renormalization operator, which in turn calls for certain estimates on the\ngeometry of the post-critical set of each map in the limit set of renormalization.\nWe have the following explicit formula for the derivative Lf = DT (f ) of T at\nf \u2208 K:\np\u22121\n1 X\nDT (f )v =\nDf j (f p\u2212j (\u03bbf x))v(f p\u2212j\u22121 (\u03bbf x))\n\u03bbf\nj=0\n\np\u22121\n\nX\n1\nDf j (f p\u2212j (0))v(f p\u2212j\u22121 (0)) ,\n+ [x(T f )\u2032 (x) \u2212 T f (x)]\n\u03bbf\nj=0\n\nwhere as before \u03bbf = f p (0) for some positive integer p = p(f, N ). We observe\nthat the operator Lf extends naturally to each of the spaces A\u03b3 for \u03b3 \u2265 0.\n\n\f758\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nProperties A1, A2 and A3 of Definition 4.1 are easily verified in our\nsetting. Property A4 follows from a general result of H\u00f6lder spaces that can\nbe proved via smoothing operators. Hence, the heart of the matter is verifying\nproperty A5. This is where the geometric scaling properties of the invariant\nCantor set of a map in K become important \u2013 see \u00a75.2. We follow Davie's\n(m)\nobservation that Lf is a special sort of operator \u2013 what we call an L-operator\n\u2013 which is amenable to analysis. The verification of the fifth property (with\n(B, C) = (A\u03b3 , A0 )) \u2013 presented in \u00a75.3 \u2013 consists in controlling the norm of a\n(m)\n(m)\ncertain positive linear operator Lf,\u03b3 : A0 \u2192 A0 associated to Lf (see Lemma\n5.3). Using the bounded distortion properties of f \u2208 K and the geometry of\nthe invariant set of f , we show that the exponential growth rate of the C 0\n(m)\nnorm of Lf,\u03b3 is bounded by some \u03bc < \u03bb if \u03b3 = 2 \u2212 \u03b1 with \u03b1 > 0 small enough\nand is bounded by some \u03bc < 1 if \u03b3 = 2 + \u03b1 with \u03b1 > 0.\n5.1.

Bounded geometry. Our aim in this section is to prove two crucial\npropositions concerning the geometry of the invariant Cantor set of an infinitely\nrenormalizable map in the limit set of renormalization. They are important\nnot only in the proof of Theorem 5.1, but also in the proof (presented in \u00a78)\nthat the renormalization operator is robust (in the sense of \u00a76).\nWe recall our notation. For each f \u2208 K, let If \u2286 I be the closure of the\npostcritical set of f (the Cantor attractor of f ). For each k \u2265 0, we can write\n1\nRk f (x) =\n* f pk (\u03bbk x)\n\u03bbk\nQk\u22121\nQk\u22121\ni\ni\nwhere pk =\ni=0 p(R f ) and \u03bbk =\ni=0 \u03bb(R f ). Recall that the renormalization intervals \u22060,k = [\u2212|\u03bbk |, |\u03bbk |] \u2282 [\u22121, 1], and \u2206i,k = f i (\u22060,k ) for\ni = 0, 1, . . . , pk \u2212 1. The collection Ck = {\u22060,k , . . . , \u2206pk \u22121,k } consists of pairS\nS\nwise disjoint intervals. Moreover, {\u2206 : \u2206 \u2208 Ck+1 } \u2286 {\u2206 : \u2206 \u2208 Ck } for all\nk \u2265 0 and we have\n\u221e p[\nk \u22121\n\\\n\u2206i,k .\nIf =\nk=0 i=0\n\nIn our first proposition, f is a normalized, symmetric quadratic unimodal\nmap, infinitely renormalizable, sufficiently smooth (say C 2 ) for Sullivan's real\nbounds to be true for f . But there are no restrictions on the combinatorics.\nWe shall use the general fact, due to Guckenheimer [12], that among those\nrenormalization intervals at the kth level the one that contains the critical\npoint of f (namely, \u22060,k ) is the largest (up to multiplication by a constant).\nThis can be seen as follows. First suppose that f is also S-unimodal. If\nn > 0 is such that f n (x) belongs to the interval with endpoints \u2212x, x but\nf j (x) does not, for all 1 \u2264 j < n, then |Df n (x)| > 1 \u2013 this uses the fact\nthat f has negative Schwarzian. From this it follows that if J \u2282 [\u22121, 1] is\nan interval that does not contain the critical point, whose iterates f j (J) are\npairwise disjoint for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 n, such that f n (J) lies in the convex-hull of J\nunion its symmetric while the previous iterates f j (J), 1 \u2264 j < n, do not, then\n|f n (J)| > |J|. Hence, if f is renormalizable, symmetric and S-unimodal then\nat each renormalization level the interval that contains the critical point is the\nlargest. If we drop the negative Schwarzian hypothesis, the same is true up to a\nmultiplicative constant. This is because every sufficiently deep renormalization\nof f already has negative Schwarzian derivative.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n761\n\nProposition 5.5.

Using that \u2206i,k has space around itself we see that for all i 6= 0 and all\nx \u2208 \u2206i,k we have di,k \u2264 |x| \u2264 Kdi,k , where K > 1 is a constant that depends\nonly on the real bounds.

Fixing\nf \u2208 K and considering the Banach space A given by Theorem 2.4, we recall\nthat the Fr\u00e9chet derivative Lf = DT (f ) : A \u2192 A is given by formula (5.0.1).\nIt is clear from that formula that Lf extends to a bounded linear operator\nL\u0302f : A0 \u2192 A0 , and moreover L\u0302f (As ) \u2286 As for all s \u2265 0 (because f is analytic).\nWe want to verify the compatibility properties of Definition 4.1 for the\nspaces B = As and C = A0 when s is close to (but different from) 2. Properties\nA1 and A2 are clearly satisfied, while A3 follows from Lemma 8.13. Property\nA4 is a consequence of the following simple fact about H\u00f6lder spaces (see [15]).\nLemma 5.9. There exists \u2206 > 1 such that A\u2229As(\u2206) is C 0 -dense in As (1).\nProof. By Theorem A.10 on page 43 of [15], there exist a family St , t > 0,\nof smoothing operators preserving even functions and C \u2265 1 such that, for\nall v \u2208 As (1), we have kSt vkC s \u2264 C and kv \u2212 St vkC 0 \u2264 Cts . By the StoneWeierstrass theorem, for all small 0 < \u03b5 < C there is a polynomial wt with\nreal coefficients and vanishing at zero such that kwt \u2212 St vkC s < \u03b5. Now let\nvt (x) = 21 (wt (x) + wt (\u2212x)), so that vt \u2208 A and we still have kvt \u2212 St vkC s < \u03b5.\nThen kvt kC s < kSt (v)kC s + \u03b5 < 2C on one hand, while kvt \u2212 vkC 0 < \u03b5 + Cts on\nthe other hand. For t small enough, this gives kvt \u2212vkC 0 < 2\u03b5 with vt \u2208 As (2C).\n\nHence all that remains is to check that property A5 is satisfied. By Lemma\n(m)\n5.3, this will be the case provided we can control the C 0 norms of L\u0302f,s . We\nshall prove this now, with the help of Propositions 5.5 and 5.8.\n(m)\nRecall that for each m \u2265 1 the operator L\u0302f is an L-operator and its\n(m)\n\nassociated positive, bounded linear operator L\u0302f,s : A0 \u2192 A0 is given by\n(5.3.1)\npk \u22121\n1 X\n(m)\n|Df j (f pk \u2212j (\u03bbk x))||\u03bbk Df pk \u2212j\u22121 (\u03bbk x)|s v(f pk \u2212j\u22121 (\u03bbk x)) ,\nL\u0302f,s (v) =\n\u03bbk\nj=0\n\n\f764\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nwhere k = mN (recall that T = RN ).

This ends the proof\nof Theorem 5.1.\n6. The local stable manifold theorem\nIn this section we isolate those features of the renormalization operator\nthat are essential for the promotion of \"hyperbolicity\" from the Banach space\nA of Theorem 2.4 to the space Ur . This leads us to the definition of a robust\noperator (see \u00a76.1). Such definition is necessarily rather technical, since it\nhas to account for the fact that the renormalization operator is not Fr\u00e9chet\ndifferentiable in Ur . In particular a robust operator acts simultaneously on\nfour different Banach spaces (corresponding in the case of renormalization to\nthe space A given by Theorem 2.4, Ar , As and A0 , where r > 1 + s and s is\nclose to 2), and satisfies several properties. The major goal of this section is\nto prove a local stable manifold theorem for robust operators.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n765\n\n6.1. Robust operators. Before moving on to a precise definition of a robust\noperator, we give the following informal description. A robust operator acts on\nfour Banach spaces A \u2282 B \u2282 C \u2282 D. In the smaller space A it acts smoothly\nand has a hyperbolic basic set K. The pairs of spaces (B, D) and (C, D) are\ncompatible with (T, K), and in particular the invariant hyperbolic splitting\nfor K in A extends to an invariant hyperbolic splitting for K in B. Viewed\nas a map from B into C, a robust operator is C 1 . It also satisfies a uniform\nGateaux differentiability condition in C for points and directions in B. Finally,\nas an operator in B, it is reasonably well-approximated by the extension of\nits derivative at a point of K in A to a bounded linear operator in B. It will\ntake us considerable effort (see \u00a78) to verify that the renormalization operator\nindeed satisfies all these conditions.\nLet T : O \u2192 A be a C 2 operator having a compact hyperbolic basic set\nK with the property that the unstable subspace of the DT -invariant splitting\nof the tangent space at each point of K is one-dimensional. By standard\ninvariant manifold theory (see [14]), we know that for all g \u2208 K the local\nunstable manifold W u (g) of T at g exists and is C 2 . In particular, we can find\na C 2 parametrization\nt 7\u2192 ug (t) \u2208 W u (g) \u2286 A\nvarying continuously with g such that ug = u\u2032g (0) is a unit vector. We define\na C 2 function t 7\u2192 \u03b4\u0302g (t) by\nT (ug (t)) = uT (g) (\u03b4\u0302g (t)) .\nThis function also varies continuously with g and \u03b4\u0302g (t) = \u03b4g t + O(t2 ) for some\n\u03b4g > 0. Recall that by hyperbolicity of K, there exist C0 > 0 and \u03bb > 1 such\nthat for every g \u2208 K and every m \u2265 1,\n(6.1.1)\n\n\u03b4T m\u22121 (g) * * * \u03b4g > C0 \u03bbm .\n\nDefinition 6.1. Let A \u2286 B \u2286 C \u2286 D be Banach spaces, where each inclusion is a compact linear operator. Let OA \u2286 A and OB \u2286 B be open sets in\ntheir respective spaces such that OA \u2286 OB . Let K \u2282 OA be a hyperbolic basic\nset of a C 2 operator T : OA \u2192 A. We say that T is robust with respect to\n(B, C, D) if it has an extension to an operator T : OB \u2192 B that satisfies the\nfollowing conditions.\nB1. The pair (B, D) is 1-compatible with T , while the pair (C, D) is\n\u03c1C -compatible with (T, K) for some \u03c1C < \u03bb (where \u03bb is as in (6.1.1)).\n(m)\n\nB2. For each m > 0, the interior OB of the set {f \u2208 OB : T i (f ) \u2208 OB ,\n(m)\n\u2200i < m} contains K, and T m : OB \u2192 C is C 1 and its derivative is\n\n\f766\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nuniformly continuous in some neighbourhood of K. Furthermore, for all\n(m)\nf \u2208 A \u2229 OB the linear map\nDT m (f ) : B \u2192 C\nextends to a continuous linear operator Lm : D \u2192 D that satisfies\nLm (X ) \u2286 X , for X = B, C.\nB3. For every m there exists Cm,1 > 1 with the property that for each g \u2208 K\nthere is an open set Vg \u2286 OB containing g such that for all f \u2208 Vg ,\nkDT m (f )ug \u2212 DT m (g)ug kC \u2264 Cm,1 kf \u2212 gkB .\nB4. There exist C1 > 1 and \u03c1 > 1 with the property that for each g \u2208 K\nthere is an open set Vg \u2286 OB containing g such that for all f1 , f2 \u2208 Vg ,\nkT (f1 ) \u2212 T (f2 ) \u2212 DT (f2 )(f1 \u2212 f2 )kC \u2264 C1 kf1 \u2212 f2 k\u03c1C .\nB5. For all m > 0, there exists Cm,2 > 0, and there exists \u03bdm > 0 such that\nfor all g \u2208 K and for all f \u2208 B with kf \u2212 gkB < \u03bdm ,\nkDT m (f ) \u2212 DT m (g)kC \u2264 Cm,2 \u03bbm .\nMoreover, there exists m0 > 0 such that for all m > m0 , Cm,2 < C0 /8\n(where C0 and \u03bb are as in (6.1.1)).\nB6. For all m > 0, there exists Cm,3 > 0 such that for all g \u2208 K, for all f \u2208 A\nwith kf \u2212 gkA < \u03bdm and for all v \u2208 B with kvkB < \u03bdm ,\nkT m (f + v) \u2212 T m (f ) \u2212 DT m (g)vkB \u2264 Cm,3 kvkB .\nMoreover, there exists m0 > 0 such that for all m > m0 , Cm,3 < 1/4.\nExample 6.1. As one might expect, the main example of a robust operator is provided by renormalization. We know from Theorem 2.4 that the\nrenormalization operator T = RN : O \u2192 A is hyperbolic over K. We also\nknow that this renormalization operator is well-defined as a map from an open\nset of U\u03b3 containing K into U\u03b3 \u2282 1 + A\u03b3 \u223c\n= A\u03b3 for all \u03b3 \u2265 2. We will show in\nSection 8 that T is robust with respect to the spaces A = A, B = Ar , C = As\nand D = A0 whenever s < 2 is close to 2 and r > s + 1 is not an integer.\n6.2. Stable manifolds for robust operators. We can now formulate a general\nlocal stable manifold theorem for robust operators.\nTheorem 6.1. Let T : OA \u2192 A be a C k with k \u2265 2 (or real analytic)\nhyperbolic operator over K \u2282 OA , and be robust with respect to (B, C, D). Then\nconditions (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Theorem 2.3 hold true for the operator T\nacting on B. The local unstable manifolds are C k with k \u2265 2 (or real analytic)\ncurves, and the local stable manifolds are of class C 1 and form a C 0 lamination.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n767\n\nThe proof of this theorem will occupy the rest of Section 6. In the end,\nthe theorem will follow by putting together Corollary 4.2, Proposition 6.13 and\nTheorem 6.15.\n6.3. Uniform bounds. Before proceeding we prove the following simple\nbounds that we will use quite often.\nLemma 6.2. There exist \u03bc0 > 0 and 1 < \u03bb < M such that for all g \u2208 K\nand all t \u2208 R with |t| < \u03bc0 , ug (t) and \u03b4\u0302g (t) are well-defined and\n(i) M \u22121 \u03bbn < \u03b4T n\u22121 (g) * * * \u03b4g < M n and \u03b4\u0302g (t) < M |t|;\n(ii) M \u22121 < kug kB < M and M \u22121 < kug kC < M ;\n(iii) M \u22121 < k\u03c3g kB < M and M \u22121 < k\u03c3g kC < M ;\n(iv) M \u22121 |t| < kug (t) \u2212 gkC < M |t| and M \u22121 |t| < kug (t) \u2212 gkB < M |t|;\n(v) |\u03c3g (ug (t) \u2212 g)| > 12 |t|.\nProof. (i) By Definition 2.1 and (6.1.1), there exist 1 < \u03bb < M1 such that\nfor all g \u2208 K and all n \u2265 1 we have M1\u22121 \u03bbn < \u03b4T n\u22121 (g) * * * \u03b4g < M1n and also\n\u03b4\u0302g (t) < M1 |t| for all |t| \u2264 \u03bc1 (where \u03bc1 > 0 is a uniform constant).\n(ii) For X equal to B and C, we have that g 7\u2192 ug as a map K \u2192 X is\ncontinuous and does not vanish. Hence, by compactness of K there is M2 > 1\nsuch that M2\u22121 < kug kX < M2 .\n(iii) Since \u03c3g (ug ) = 1 and by property B1 in Definition 6.1, the functional \u03c3g extends continuously to X and there is M3 > 1 such that M3\u22121 <\nk\u03c3g kX < M3 .\n(iv) Since t \u2192 ug (t) as a map R \u2192 X is C 1 and varies continuously with\ng \u2208 K, there is M4 > 0 and \u03bc2 > 0 such that kug (t) \u2212 ug (s)kX \u2264 M4 |t \u2212 s| for\nall g \u2208 K and all t, s with |t| < \u03bc2 and |s| < \u03bc2 . Moreover, since\nd\nug (t)\ndt\n\n= ug 6= 0\nt=0\n\nthere exists M5 > 0 and \u03bc3 > 0 such that |t \u2212 s| \u2264 M5 kug (t) \u2212 ug (s)kX for\nall g \u2208 K and all |t| < \u03bc3 . Hence (iv) follows by taking s = 0 and noting that\nug (0) = g.\n(v) This follows from (iv) and the fact that \u03c3g (ug ) = 1.\n6.4. Contraction towards the unstable manifolds. The one-dimensional\nunstable manifolds of T in A are embedded in B, and remain invariant. The\nfirst important estimate given by the following lemma shows that in B the operator T contracts towards such manifolds. Therefore, if T is to have unstable\n\n\f768\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nmanifolds in B, these have to coincide with unstable manifolds in A. In what\nfollows, we fix g \u2208 K and for simplicity of notation we write\n\u03c3i = \u03c3T i (g) , ui = uT i (g) , ui = uT i (g) ,\nand\n\u03b4im =\n\nm\u22121\nY\n\n\u03b4T j (g) , \u03b4\u0302im = \u03b4\u0302T m\u22121 (g) \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03b4\u0302T i (g) .\n\nj=i\n\nSet \u03bc0 > 0 as in Lemma 6.2.\nLemma 6.3. For every m > 0 there exist 0 < \u03b7m < \u03bc0 and Bm > 0 such\nthat for every g \u2208 K and every v \u2208 B with kvkB < \u03b7m and t \u2208 R with |t| < \u03b7m ,\n(m)\n\u03b4\u03020m (t + \u03c30 (v)) < \u03bc0 , u0 (t) + v \u2208 OB and\n\u0010\n\u0011\nT m (u0 (t) + v) \u2212 um \u03b4\u03020m (t + \u03c30 (v))\n< Bm kvkB .\nB\n\nFurthermore, there is m1 > m0 (where m0 is as in B6) such that for all\nm > m1 , Bm < 1/2.\n\nProof. We prove the second inequality only. The first is proven in the\nsame way. By property B6 in Definition 6.1, there is m0 > 0 such that for all\nm > m0 , all v with kvkB < \u03bdm , and all t \u2208 R with |t| < \u03bdm ,\n1\nkvkB .\n4\nBy property B1 in Definition 6.1, (B, D) is 1-compatible with (T, K). Hence,\nby Corollary 4.2, there exists m1 > m0 such that for all m > m1 we have\n\n(6.4.1)\n\nkT m (u0 (t) + v) \u2212 T m (u0 (t)) \u2212 DT m (g)vkB \u2264\n\n1\nkDT m (g)v \u2212 \u03b40m \u03c30 (v)um kB \u2264 kvkB .\n8\nPutting (6.4.1) and (6.4.2) together we get\n(6.4.2)\n\n(6.4.3)\n\n3\nkT m (u0 (t) + v) \u2212 T m (u0 (t)) \u2212 \u03b40m \u03c30 (v)um kB \u2264 kvkB .\n8\n\nNow, we know that T m (u0 (t)) = um (\u03b4\u03020m (t)) and t \u2192 um \u25e6 \u03b4\u03020m (t) is C 2 . Hence,\num \u25e6 \u03b4\u03020m (t + \u03c30 (v)) \u2212 um \u25e6 \u03b4\u03020m (t) \u2212 \u03b40m \u03c30 (v)um kB\n(6.4.4)\n\n\u0001\n\u2264 c1 (\u03c30 (v))2 + |t|\u03c30 (v)\n\u2264 c2 (kvkB + |t|) kvkB .\n\nTherefore, choosing \u03b7m < \u03bdm so small that C2 \u03b7m < 1/16 and putting 6.4.3\nand 6.4.4 together, we see that if |t| < \u03b7m and kvkB < \u03b7m then\nT m (u0 (t) + v) \u2212 um \u25e6 \u03b4\u03020m (t + \u03c30 (v))\nas desired.\n\nB\n\n1\n\u2264 kvkB\n2\n\n\f769\n\nGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\nLemma 6.4.

Local stable sets.

This is done in\nLemma 6.5 below (see also Remark 6.1).\nFrom now on in this section, we let m1 and \u03b50 > \u03b51 > \u03b52 > \u03b5 be as in\nLemma 6.4. For all sufficiently small 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b52 and for all f \u2208 B(g, \u03b5), we let\nk0 = k0 (g, f ) and tk = tk (g, f ) for k = 0, . . . , k0 be as in Lemma 6.4. We write\nB(g, \u03b5) = V\u03b5\u2212 (g) \u222a V\u03b50 (g) \u222a V\u03b5+ (g) where\nV\u03b5\u2212 (g) = {f \u2208 B(g, \u03b5) : \u2212\u03b50 < tk0 (g, f ) < \u2212\u03b51 } ,\nV\u03b5+ (g) = {f \u2208 B(g, \u03b5) : \u03b51 < tk0 (g, f ) < \u03b50 } ,\n\u0001\nV\u03b50 (g) = B(g, \u03b5) \\ V\u03b5\u2212 (g) \u222a V\u03b5+ (g) .\n\n\f772\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nLemma 6.5. There exist an integer m and a positive constant C2 with the\nfollowing properties. For all \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small and for all g \u2208 K, the sets\nV\u03b5\u2212 (g) and V\u03b5+ (g) are open subsets of B(g, \u03b5) (and so V\u03b50 (g) is relatively closed\nin B(g, \u03b5)), and for all f \u2208 V\u03b50 (g)\nT j (f ) \u2212 T j (g)\n\n(6.5.1)\n\nB\n\n\u2264 \u03b5C2 2\u2212j/m .\n\nFurthermore, the local stable set W\u03b5s (g) is a relatively open subset of V\u03b50 (g) and\n(6.5.2) \b\nW\u03b5s (g) = f \u2208 V\u03b50 (g) : T j (f ) \u2212 T j (g) B < \u03b5, for all 0 \u2264 j \u2264 m log C2 / log 2 .\nProof. The first assertion is a consequence of the definitions of V\u03b5\u2212 (g) and\nand Lemma 6.4. It follows from property (i) of Lemma 6.4 that\n\nV\u03b5+ (g)\n\nV\u03b50 (g) = {f \u2208 B(g, \u03b5) : |tk (g, f )| < \u03b51 , for all k \u2265 0} .\nIt also follows from property (ii) of Lemma 6.4 that if f \u2208 B(g, \u03b5) and |tk0 (g, f )|\n\u2265 \u03b51 then T k0 m f \u2212 T k0 m g B > \u03b5 where k0 = k0 (g, f ). This shows that\nW\u03b5s (g) \u2282 V\u03b50 (g), and therefore (6.5.1) implies (6.5.2). Furthermore, W\u03b5s (g) is a\nrelatively open subset of V\u03b50 (g).\nIt remains to show that if f \u2208 V\u03b50 (g) then (6.5.1) holds. Set 1 < \u03bb < M as\nin Lemma 6.2. Since \u03b2 > 2, by Lemma 6.2, there is m large enough such that\n(k+1)m\n\u2265 M \u22121 \u03bbm > \u03b2 > 2 for every k \u2265 0. By Lemma 6.4, for all k \u2265 0, we\n\u03b4km\nknow that tk = tk (g, f ) and vk = vk (g, f ) are well-defined, and satisfy |tk | < \u03b51\n(k+1)m\n(k+1)m\n(tk + \u03c3km (vk )). Since \u03b4km\nand kvk kB \u2264 \u03b52\u2212k . Furthermore, tk+1 = \u03b4\u0302km\nis C 2 and k\u03c3km kB < M (see Lemma 6.2), there is c0 > 1 so that\n(k+1)m\n\ntk+1 \u2212 \u03b4km\n\n(k+1)m\n\ntk \u2264 \u03b4\u0302km\n\n(k+1)m\n\n(k+1)m\n\n(tk ) \u2212 \u03b4km\n\u0001\n\u2264 c0 kvk kB + |tk |2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2264 c0 \u03b52\u2212k + |tk |2 .\n+ \u03b4\u0302km\n\nHence (6.5.3) gives\n\n(k+1)m\n\n(tk + \u03c3km (vk )) \u2212 \u03b4\u0302km\n\n(tk )\n\ntk\n\n|tk | \u2264 \u03b5c0 \u03b2 \u22121 2\u2212k + \u03b2 \u22121 |tk+1 | + c0 \u03b2 \u22121 |tk |2 .\nTaking \u03b5 (in Lemma 6.4) so small that c0 \u03b2 \u22121 \u03b5 < 1/2, we get\n\u0001\n(6.5.3)\n|tk | \u2264 2 |tk | \u2212 c0 \u03b2 \u22121 |tk |2 \u2264 \u03b52c0 \u03b2 \u22121 2\u2212k + 2\u03b2 \u22121 |tk+1 | ,\n\nfor all k \u2265 0. Since 2\u03b2 \u22121 < 1, using induction in (6.5.3) and the\n\u0001 fact that tk\n\u2212k\n\u22121\n\u22121\nis bounded, we get |tk | \u2264 \u03b5c1 2 with c1 = 2c0 \u03b2 / 1 \u2212 2\u03b2\nfor all k \u2265 0.\nNow this estimate together with Lemma 6.2 gives\nkukm (tk ) \u2212 T km (g)kB \u2264 M |tk | \u2264 \u03b5c1 M 2\u2212k .\n\n\f773\n\nGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\nHence, using Lemma 6.4 again, we get\nT km (f ) \u2212 T km (g)\n\nB\n\n\u2264 kvk kB + ukm (tk ) \u2212 T km (g)\n\u2212k\n\n\u2264 \u03b52\n\n\u2212k\n\n+ \u03b5c1 M 2\n\n\u2212k\n\n= \u03b5c2 2\n\nB\n\n.\n\nTherefore, by (iv) in Lemma 6.4, for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , m \u2212 1},\nT km+i (f ) \u2212 T km+i (g)\n\nB\n\n\u2264 M0 T km (f ) \u2212 T km (g)\n\nB\n\n\u2264 \u03b5c3 2\u2212k ,\n\nwhich ends the proof.\nRemark 6.1.

Our next goal is to show that V\u03b50 (g) is a C 1 manifold\nprovided \u03b5 is sufficiently small. The first step towards this goal is to find the\nnatural candidate for the tangent space at every point f \u2208 V\u03b50 (g). This will\nbe accomplished in Lemma 6.7 below. The proof will require the following\nelementary bootstrapping result.\nLemma 6.6.

We may assume that c0 \u2265 1. Let n0 > 0 be such that c0 n0 /2n0 <\n1/2, and set b = max1\u2264j\u2264n0 {|aj |}. Then we see by induction from (6.6.1) that\n|an | \u2264 b for all n \u2265 1, and so\n1\nnbc0\n|an+1 | \u2264 |an | + n\n4\n2 \u0012 \u0013\n3 n\n1\n.\n\u2264 |an | + bc0\n4\n4\nP\nBy induction, this yields |an | \u2264 (2bc0 )( 34 )n for all n \u2265 1.

There exist an integer m, constants C3 , C4 > 0 and \u03b5 > 0\nsmall enough with the following properties. For every g \u2208 K and for every\nf \u2208 V\u03b50 (g) there exists a linear functional \u03b8f,g \u2208 C \u2217 with norm bounded from\nabove by C3 and with the property that\n(6.6.2)\n\nDT j (f )v \u2212 \u03b40j \u03b8f,g (v)uj\n\nC\n\n\u2264 C4 \u03b40j 2\u2212j/m kvkC ,\n\nfor all v \u2208 C and all j \u2265 1.

The hyperplane ker(\u03b8f ) is the\nnatural candidate to be the tangent space of V\u03b50 (f ) at f since it corresponds\nto all vectors which expand under DT j (f ) by a factor less than \u03b40j .\nProof of Lemma 6.7.

The main estimates. Besides aiming at proving that the local stable\nset is a C 1 manifold, we want to show that the local hyperbolicity picture holds\n(in B) near K.

Hence, \u03be\u02c6g is a C 1 map.\nLet us check that \u03be\u02c6g varies continuously with g in the C 1 sense and, more\nprecisely, that the map K \u2229 B(g0 , \u03b10 ) \u2192 C 1 (Eg0 ,\u03b11 , R) given by g 7\u2192 \u03be\u0302g is\ncontinuous.

Smooth holonomies\nIn the previous section we proved that a robust operator T has C 1 local\nstable manifolds through each point of its hyperbolic basic set K, and that such\nmanifolds form a C 0 lamination (near each point of K). A natural question\nthat may be asked at this point is this: how smooth is the holonomy of this\nlamination? To answer this question we shall assume that there exists a homeomorphism H : \u0398Z \u2192 K of a finite-type shift space onto K which conjugates\nthe two-sided full shift \u03c3 : \u0398Z \u2192 K to our robust operator T restricted to K.\nUnder this topological assumption, and an additional geometric assumption\nconcerning the unstable manifolds of points in the attractor \u2013both of which\nare satisfied by the renormalization operator\u2013 we shall prove below that the\nholonomies of the local stable laminations are C 1+\u03b8 for some \u03b8 > 0.\n7.1.

Let Ck (g) be the set of all these intervals\n\u2206...,\u03b8k (g).\nDefinition 7.1. We say that the local unstable manifolds W\u03b5u0 (g) have\ngeometry bounded by \u03b1 > 0 if for every g \u2208 K, Kg has geometry bounded\nby \u03b1 > 0 with respect to the collection (Ck (g))k\u22650 (in the sense of \u00a73).\nNow suppose in addition that the operator T is robust with respect to the\nBanach spaces (B, C, D). By Theorem 6.1, the local stable manifolds of T in B\nform a C 0 lamination Let F : [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] \u2192 B(g, \u03b5) be a C 2 curve transversal to\nthe stable lamination. Let KF be the set of all values r \u2208 [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] such that\n[\nW\u03b5s0 (g0 ) .\nfr = F (r) \u2208\ng0 \u2208K\u2229W\u03b5u0 (g0 )\n\nThe holonomy map \u03c6F : F (KF ) \u2192 W\u03b5u0 (g) associates to each fr the point\n\u03c6F (fr ) such that fr \u2208 W\u03b5s0 (\u03c6F (fr )). In local coordinates, the holonomy map\n\u03c6F is given by \u03c8F : KF \u2192 Kg where \u03c8F (t) = ug \u25e6 \u03c6F \u25e6 F \u22121 and KF , Kg \u2282 R.\nThe C 2 curve F : [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] \u2192 B(g, \u03b5) is an ordered transversal to the stable\nfoliation if F is transversal to the stable foliation, \u03c6F : F (KF ) \u2192 W\u03b5u0 (g)\nextends to F ([\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ]) as a homeomorphism \u03c6\u0302F over its image such that\n\u03c6F (F (KF )) = \u03c6\u0302F (F (KF )) \u2229 K.\nWe note that, by Remark 6.2 and by Theorem 6.15, there is \u03b51 < \u03b50\nsmall enough such that a C 2 transversal to W\u03b5s1 (g) in a point f is an ordered\ntransversal to the stable foliation in a small neighborhood of f .\nTheorem 7.1. Let K \u2282 OA be a hyperbolic basic set of a C 2 operator\nT : OA \u2192 A which is robust with respect to (B, C, D). Suppose that there exits\n\u03b50 > 0 such that the local unstable manifolds W\u03b5u0 (g) of g \u2208 K have bounded\ngeometry. There exists 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b50 with the property that for every C 2 ordered\ntransversal F : [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] \u2192 B(g, \u03b5) to the stable foliation in B, the holonomy\n\u03c6F : F (KF ) \u2192 W\u03b5u0 (g) has a C 1+\u03b8 diffeomorphic extension to F ([\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ]) for\nsome \u03b8 > 0.\nExample 7.1. As we know from Theorem 2.4, the renormalization operator T = RN : OA \u2192 A is hyperbolic over K. As we shall see in Theorem\n\n\f792\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\n8.1, T is robust with respect to (Ar , As , A0 ) provided s > s0 with s0 sufficiently close to 2 and r > s + 1 is not an integer. By Theorem 2.1, there is a\ntwo-sided full shift topologically conjugated to T |K. By Lemmas 9.3 and 9.6\nrespectively on pages 403 and 405 of Lyubich's paper [20], there is \u03b1 > 0 such\nthat the local unstable manifolds W\u03b5u0 (g) have geometry bounded by \u03b1. Hence\nthe renormalization operator T satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 7.1.\nIn what follows, the notation A = O(B) means that \u03bc\u22121\n1 B \u2264 A \u2264 \u03bc1 B\nand the notation A = B(1 \u00b1 O(C)) means that B(1 \u2212 \u03bc2 C) \u2264 A \u2264 B(1 + \u03bc2 C)\nfor some constants \u03bc1 > 1 and \u03bc2 > 0.\nThe proof of Theorem 7.1 will be a consequence of the following lemmas.\nLemma 7.2. For every C 2 curve F : [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] \u2192 B(g, \u03b5) transversal to\nthe stable foliation and for all r, t \u2208 [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] such that r < t,\nkft \u2212 fr kX = O(|t \u2212 r|) ,\n\n(7.1.1)\n\n|\u03b8fr (ft \u2212 fr )| = O(|t \u2212 r|) ,\nand for all s, r, t \u2208 [\u2212\u03bc0 , \u03bc0 ] such that s < r < t,\n|t \u2212 r|\nkft \u2212 fr kX\n=\n(7.1.2)\n(1 \u00b1 O(|t \u2212 s|)) ,\nkfs \u2212 fr kX |s \u2212 r|\nk\u03b8fr (ft \u2212 fr )kX\n|t \u2212 r|\n=\n(1 \u00b1 O(|t \u2212 s|)) ,\nk\u03b8fr (fs \u2212 fr )kX |s \u2212 r|\nwhere X \u2208 {B, C, D}.\nProof.

Since F is C 2 ,\nft \u2212 fr = (t \u2212 r)ur \u00b1 O(|t \u2212 r|2 ),\n\u03b8fr (ft \u2212 fr ) = (t \u2212 r)\u03b8fr (ur ) \u00b1 O(|t \u2212 r|2 ) ,\nand so (7.1.1) follows.

The renormalization operator is robust\nFrom the very beginning, our main goal is to show that the renormalization operator is \"hyperbolic\" in Ur , provided r is sufficiently large. More\nprecisely, we want to establish Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6. We have already\nat our disposal an abstract theorem (Theorem 6.1) showing that any robust\noperator is indeed \"hyperbolic\". Hence, our work has been essentially reduced\nto showing that the renormalization operator T , or any one of its powers, is\nrobust (see Theorem 8.1 below). The proofs of Theorem 2.5 and Corollary 2.6\nwill be given in \u00a78.6.\nWe emphasize the important role played by the geometric estimates of \u00a75.2\nin the verification of properties B5 and B6 of a robust operator (Definition\n6.1) for an iterate of the renormalization operator (see \u00a78.4). Properties B2,\nB3, and B4 are relatively straightforward consequences of the properties of\nthe composition operator studied in \u00a78.1 and are proved in \u00a78.2 and \u00a78.3 .\nIn this section, we shall prove the following result (see \u00a78.5).\nTheorem 8.1. Let T : O \u2192 A be the renormalization operator given by\nTheorem 2.4. If s > s0 with s0 < 2 sufficiently close to 2 and r > s + 1 not an\ninteger, then T is a robust operator with respect to (Ar , As , A0 ).\nWe shall present in the sequel complete proofs of all the estimates that are\nnecessary for establishing the above result, carefully checking all the properties\nof robustness along the way.\nIn our estimates we will often concern ourselves with a power T m of T .\nFor each m \u2265 1, let Om \u2286 O be the (open) set of those f 's which are mN\ntimes renormalizable. Then T m is well-defined in Om and we can write\n1\n* f p \u25e6 \u039bf ,\nT m (f ) =\n\u03bbf\nwhere p = p(f, mN ), \u03bbf = f p (0), and \u039bf : x 7\u2192 \u03bbf x is the linear scaling. Note\nthat p (and hence \u03bbf and \u039bf ) depends on m, but if m is held fixed then p\nis a locally constant function of f \u2208 Om . To keep track of the dependence of\nconstants on m, we shall denote by K those constants that may depend on m,\nand by c those that are independent of m.\nLikewise, we define Orm to be an open set in Ur containing K, all of whose\nelements are mN times renormalizable, so that T m = RmN : Orm \u2192 Ur is\nwell-defined.\n8.1. A closer look at composition. From a differentiable viewpoint, composition is a notoriously ill-behaved operation. Such bad behavior is the source\nof most technical difficulties arising in this work. Fortunately, some positive\nresults lie at hand. For example, it is well-known that if r is a positive integer then composition, viewed as an operator from C r \u00d7 C r\u22121 into C r\u22121 , is\n\n\f798\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\na C 1 map (see [11]). We shall need not only this result but also a less wellknown generalization of it for H\u00f6lder spaces: if r \u2212 1 > s \u2265 1 are real numbers\nthen composition, as an operator from C r \u00d7 C s into C s , is a C 1 map (we can\nsay a little bit more \u2013 see Proposition 8.7 below). For related results on the\nsmoothness of composition, see [19].\nBefore we can prove this fact, some auxiliary results are in order. In what\nfollows, our definition of the C r norm of \u03c6 \u2208 C r (I) is this: for r = k + \u03b1 with\nk \u2208 N and 0 \u2264 \u03b1 < 1 we write\nk\u03c6kC r = max{k\u03c6k0 , k\u03c6\u2032 k0 , . . . , k\u03c6(k) k0 ; k\u03c6(k) k\u03b1 } .\nFor r = k + Lip we define k\u03c6kC r as above with \u03b1 = 1. This norm is\nequivalent to the one introduced earlier in 5.1, and has the advantage that\nk\u03c6kC r = max{k\u03c6kC 0 , k\u03c6\u2032 kC r\u22121 } whenever r \u2265 1. This allows us to prove\ncertain estimates by induction on k, which will be very useful later.\nLemma 8.2.

For every polynomial P of degree d in n variables x1 , x2 , . . . , xn over R, define \u03bd(P ) as the sum of the absolute values of the\ncoefficients of P . This is a well-known valuation in the ring R[x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ],\nbut all that really matters to us is that \u03bd(P +Q) \u2264 \u03bd(P )+\u03bd(Q) (sub-additivity),\nand that \u03bd(\u2202xi P ) \u2264 d\u03bd(P ).\nLemma 8.3.

The desired result\nfor part (i) then follows by induction. Part (ii) is a corollary of part (i), and\nby a computation (8.1.10) follows from (8.1.9).\nProposition 8.9. Let r, s, t be real numbers with 2 \u2264 s+1 < r and t \u2265 0.\nLet U : C t (I, I) \u2192 C s (I, I) be a C 1 operator. Then for each \u03c6 \u2208 C r (I) and\neach \u03c8 \u2208 C t (I, I) there exists a function \u03c3\u03c8 : R+ \u2192 R+ with \u03c3\u03c8 (h)/h \u2192 0 as\nh \u2192 0, varying continuously with \u03c8, such that for all v \u2208 C t (I) with \u03c8 + v \u2208\nC t (I, I),\n(8.1.11)\n\n\u03c6 \u25e6 U (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 \u03c6 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) * DU (\u03c8)v\n\nCs\n\n\u2264 \u03c3\u03c8 (kvkC t ) .\n\nProof. As before, we denote by K1 , K2 , . . . positive constants that depend\nonly on k\u03c8kC t . We have that\n\u03c6 \u25e6 U (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 \u03c6 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) * DU (\u03c8)v = A + B\nwhere\nA = \u03c6 \u25e6 U (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 \u03c6 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) * (U (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 U (\u03c8)) ,\nB = \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6 U (\u03c8) * (U (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 U (\u03c8) \u2212 DU (\u03c8)v) .\nSince U is C 1 , there exists a continuous function \u03bd\u03c8 : R+ \u2192 R+ with \u03bd\u03c8 (h)/h\n\u2192 0 as h \u2192 0, varying continuously with \u03c8, such that\nkU (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 U (\u03c8) \u2212 DU (\u03c8)vkC s \u2264 \u03bd\u03c8 (kvkC t ) .\nHence, applying Proposition 8.6 with f = \u03c6 and g = U (\u03c8) and v replaced by\nU (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 U (\u03c8), we get\n\nand\n\nkAkC s \u2264 K2 k\u03c6kC r (kU (\u03c8 + v) \u2212 U (\u03c8)kC s )1+\u03b8\n\u0011\n\u0010\n,\n\u2264 K3 k\u03c6kC r kDU (\u03c8)k1+\u03b8 kvk1+\u03b8\nt\nC\nkBkC s \u2264 K4 k\u03c6kC r \u03bd\u03c8 (kvkC t ) ,\n\nwhere K3 = K3 (kU (\u03c8)kC s , kDU (\u03c8)k, \u03bd\u03c8 ) and K4 = K2 (kU (\u03c8)kC s ).

Let r, s, t be real numbers with r \u2212 1 > s > 1 and\n0 \u2264 t \u2264 r, and let U : C t (I, I) \u2192 C s (I, I) be a C 1 operator. For each positive\ninteger n the operator Vn : C r (I, I) \u2192 C s (I) given by Vn (f ) = (f m )\u2032 \u25e6 U (f ) is\ndifferentiable at every g \u2208 C r+1 (I, I) \u2286 C r (I, I), and as a map from C r+1 (I, I)\ninto L(C r (I), C s (I)), the derivative operator g 7\u2192 DVn (g) is continuous.\nProof. First note that by the chain rule,\nVn (f ) =\n\nn\u22121\nY\nj=0\n\n\u0010\n\u0011 n\u22121\nY\nf \u2032 \u25e6 Uj (f ) .\nf \u2032 \u25e6 f (j) \u25e6 U (f ) =\nj=0\n\nThis reduces the problem to the case n = 1. We claim that the linear operator\nL(v) = v \u2032 \u25e6 U (g) + g \u2032\u2032 \u25e6 U (g) * DU (g)v\nis the derivative of V1 at g \u2208 C r+1 (I, I). Indeed, we have\nV1 (g + v) \u2212 V1 (g) \u2212 L(v) = A + B ,\nwhere\nA = g\u2032 \u25e6 U (g + v) \u2212 g \u2032 \u25e6 U (g) \u2212 g \u2032\u2032 \u25e6 U (g) * DU (g)v ,\nB = v \u2032 \u25e6 U (g + v) \u2212 v \u2032 \u25e6 U (g) .\nBy Proposition 8.9 applied to \u03c6 = g \u2032 and \u03c8 = g, there exists K1 = K1 (kgkC r+1 )\nsuch that\nkAkC s \u2264 K1 \u03c3\u03c8 (kvkC r ) ,\nwhere \u03c3\u03c8 : R+ \u2192 R+ is a continuous function varying continuously with \u03c8 such\nthat \u03c3\u03c8 (h)/h \u2192 0 as h \u2192 0. On the other hand, by part (i) of Proposition 8.4\nand since U is C 1 , we have\nkBkC s \u2264 K2 kvkC r kU (g + v) \u2212 U (g)k\u03b5C s\n\u2264 K3 (kvkC r )1+\u03b5 ,\nwhere 0 < \u03b5 = min{1 \u2212 {s}, r \u2212 s} < 1, K2 = K2 (kU (g)kC s ) and K3 =\nK3 (kU (g)kC s , kDU (g)k, \u03c3\u03c8 (kvkC r )). Combining these inequalities, we deduce\nthat V1 is differentiable at g and DV1 (g) = L as claimed. It is clear from the\nexpression defining it that L varies continuously with g \u2208 C r+1 (I, I).\n8.2. Checking properties B2 and B3. We now proceed to verify that the\noperator T satisfies properties B2 and B3 of robustness. They will follow\nrespectively from Lemmas 8.12 and 8.13. First it is necessary to analyze the\nbehavior of the linear scaling used in such operators. Let us fix a positive\ninteger p and for each f \u2208 C r (I, I) let \u039bf be the linear map x 7\u2192 \u03bbf x, where\n\u03bbf = f p (0).\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n807\n\nLemma 8.11. For r > 2, the maps \u039b : C r (I, I) \u2192 L(R, R) given by\n\u039b(f ) = \u039bf and \u03bb : C r (I, I) \u2192 R given by \u03bb(f ) = \u03bbf are both C 1+\u03b8 for some\n0 < \u03b8 = \u03b8(r, s) < 1. In particular, there is K = K(p, kf kC r ) > 0 such that for\nall v \u2208 C r (I) with kvkC r \u2264 1 and f + v \u2208 C r (I, I),\nk\u03bb(f + v) \u2212 \u03bb(f ) \u2212 D\u03bb(f )vkC r \u2264 Kkvk1+\u03b8\nCr .\n\n(8.2.1)\n\nThe above inequality also holds when \u03bb is replaced by \u039b.\nProof. Choosing 1 < s < r \u2212 1, we see that \u03bb = E \u25e6 Qp where Qp :\nC r (I, I) \u2192 C s (I, I) is the operator Qp (f ) = f p , which is C 1+\u03b8 for some 0 <\n\u03b8 = \u03b8(r, s) < 1, and E : C s (I, I) \u2192 R is the evaluation map E(g) = g(0),\nwhich is linear. Therefore, by Corollary 8.8, \u03bb is C 1+\u03b8 and (8.2.1) follows from\n(8.1.10) and the linearity of E. The proof for \u039b is entirely analogous.\nWe will also need to use the operators Un : C r (I, I) \u2192 C s (I) given by\nUn (f ) = f n \u25e6 \u039bf for all n \u2265 0.\nProperty B2 for the operator T is a consequence of the following lemma\n(the first assertion in B2 is actually a consequence of Lemma 8.14 below).\nLemma 8.12. For 2 < s + 1 < r and for each n \u2265 0, the operator Un :\nC r (I, I) \u2192 C s (I) is C 1+\u03b8 for some 0 < \u03b8 = \u03b8(r, s) < 1. In particular, T m :\nOrm \u2192 Us is also a C 1+\u03b8 operator.\nProof. This follows at once from Lemma 8.11 and Corollary 8.8 applied\nto U = \u039b.\nThe following lemma is all we need to verify property B3 for the operator T . In this case g is a map in the limit set K of T , hence analytic, and\nv = ug is a tangent vector to the unstable manifold of g, which is analytic as\nwell.\nLemma 8.13. For 2 < s + 1 < r, the map Orm \u2192 Us given by f 7\u2192\nis differentiable at f = g \u2208 K. Furthermore, for every m \u2265 1\nthere exist Cm > 1 and \u03bdm > 0 such that for each g \u2208 K and f \u2208 Orm with\nkf \u2212 gkC r < \u03bdm and all v \u2208 Ar with kvkC r = 1,\nDT m (f )v\n\nkDT m (f )v \u2212 DT m (g)vkC s \u2264 Cm kf \u2212 gkC r .\n\n(8.2.2)\n\nProof. Let E : C s (I, I) \u2192 R be the evaluation map E(g) = g(0), which is\nlinear. Recall that the derivative of T m is given by the expression\n(8.2.3) DT m (f )v =\n\np\u22121\n1 X j \u2032\n(f ) \u25e6 Up\u2212j (f ) * v \u25e6 Up\u2212j\u22121 (f )\n\u03bbf\nj=0\n\n+\n\np\u22121\nX\n\u0001\n1\nE (f j )\u2032 \u25e6 Up\u2212j (f ) * E (v \u25e6 Up\u2212j\u22121 (f )) ,\n[id * (T m f )\u2032 \u2212 T m f ]\n\u03bbf\nj=0\n\n\f808\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nwhere \u03bbf = E \u25e6 f p and id : R \u2192 R is the identity map. Each term of the\nfirst summation in (8.2.3) is differentiable at f = g. To see this apply Lemma\n8.12 and Corollary 8.10 to each of the operators f 7\u2192 (f j )\u2032 \u25e6 Up\u2212j (f ) as well as\nProposition 8.6 to each of the operators f 7\u2192 v \u25e6 Up\u2212j (f ). On the other hand,\neach term of the second summation in (8.2.3) equals the corresponding term\nin the first summation post-composed with the evaluation map E (which is\nlinear), and is therefore differentiable at f = g. The analysis of the expression\nin square brackets in (8.2.3) is similar. By Lemma 8.11 and Corollary 8.10, the\noperator f 7\u2192 T m (f )\u2032 = (f p )\u2032 \u25e6 \u039bf is differentiable at f = g, and the operator\nf 7\u2192 T m (f ) = \u03bbf * f p \u25e6 \u039bf is also differentiable at f = g by Lemma 8.11\nand Corollary 8.8. From this fact and compactness of K the inequality (8.2.2)\nfollows.\n8.3. Checking property B4. The fifth property is verified in Lemma 8.16\nbelow. First we will need to prove the following two lemmas about the operators Ui : C t+1+\u03b5 (I, I) \u2192 C t (I) with t \u2265 1. Recall that Ui (f ) = f i \u25e6 \u039bf .\nLemma 8.14. For every f \u2208 C t+1+\u03b5 (I, I) and all v \u2208 C t (I) with small\nnorm and such that f + v \u2208 C t (I, I),\nkUi (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f )kC t \u2264 KkvkC t\nfor all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p where K = K (p, kf kC t+1+\u03b5 ).\nProof. Note that\nUi+1 (f + v) \u2212 Ui+1 (f ) = f \u25e6 Ui (f + v) \u2212 f \u25e6 Ui (f ) + v \u25e6 Ui (f + v) .\nBy Proposition 8.6, there is K1 = K1 (p, kf kC t+1+\u03b5 ) such that\nkUi+1 (f + v) \u2212 Ui+1 (f )kC t \u2264 K1 kUi (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f )kC t + kv \u25e6 Ui (f + v)kC t .\nThe required estimate now follows by induction, because U0 is C 1 .\nLemma 8.15. For every f \u2208 C t+1+\u03b5 (I, I) and all v \u2208 C t+1+\u03b5 (I) with\nsmall norm and such that f + v \u2208 C t+1+\u03b5 (I, I),\nkUi (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f ) \u2212 DUi (f )vkC t \u2264 Kkvk1+\u03b8\nCt ,\nfor all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p, for some 0 < \u03b8 = \u03b8(t, \u03b5) < 1 and K = K(p, kf kC t ) > 0.\nProof. In this proof we denote by K1 , K2 , . . . the positive constants depending only on m and kUi (f )kC t+1+\u03b5 . Again we use induction; the case i = 0\nfollows from the differentiability of the scaling f \u2192 \u039bf and inequality (8.2.1).\nWe have\nUi+1 (f + v) \u2212 Ui+1 (f ) \u2212 DUi+1 (f )v = A + B + C\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n809\n\nwhere\nA = f \u25e6 Ui (f + v) \u2212 f \u25e6 Ui (f ) \u2212 f \u2032 \u25e6 Ui (f ) * (Ui (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f )) ,\nB = f \u2032 \u25e6 Ui (f ) * (Ui (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f ) \u2212 DUi (f )v) ,\nC = v \u25e6 Ui (f + v) \u2212 v \u25e6 Ui (f ) .\nBy Proposition 8.6,\nkAkC t \u2264 K1 kUi (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f )k1+\u03b5\nCt .\nUsing Lemma 8.14, we get\nkAkC t\u22121 \u2264 K2 kvk1+\u03b5\nCt .\nOn the other hand, since v is C t+1+\u03b5/2 , we know again from Proposition 8.6\nthat\nkCkC t \u2264 K3 kvkC t+1+\u03b5/2 kUi (f + v) \u2212 Ui (f )kC t \u2264 K4 kvkC r+1+\u03b5/2 kvkC t .\nSince v has bounded C t+1+\u03b5 norm, by an interpolation of norms, we have\nkvkC t+1+\u03b5/2 \u2264 K5 kvk\u03b8C1t for some \u03b81 > 0. Therefore, taking \u03b8 = min{\u03b5, \u03b81 } we\nget\nkCkC t \u2264 K6 kvk1+\u03b8\nCt .\nThis allows the induction as desired.\nProperty B4 for the operator T is a direct consequence of the following\nlemma.\nLemma 8.16. For every f \u2208 Os+1+\u03b5 and all v \u2208 As+1+\u03b5 with small norm\nsuch that f + v \u2208 Os+1+\u03b5 ,\nkT (f + v) \u2212 T (f ) \u2212 DT (f )(v)kC s \u2264 Kkvk1+\u03c4\nCs ,\nfor some 0 < \u03c4 = \u03c4 (s, \u03b5) < 1 and K(p, kf kC s+1+\u03b5 ) > 0.\nProof. In this proof we denote by K1 , K2 , . . . the positive constants depending only on m and kUi (f )kC s . Start, observing that since T (f ) = \u03bb\u22121\nf\n* Up (f ),\nT (f + v) \u2212 T (f ) \u2212 DT (f )v = A + B + C\nwhere\nA = \u03bb\u22121\nf * (Up (f + v) \u2212 Up (f ) \u2212 DUp (f )v) ,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\n\u22121\nB = \u03bb\u22121\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n\u2212\nD\u03bb\n(v)\n* Up (f + v) ,\nf +v\nf\nf\nC = D\u03bb\u22121\nf (v) * (Up (f + v) \u2212 Up (f )) .\n\nApplying Lemma 8.15 with t = s we get\n1+\u03b81\n,\nkAkC s = K1 kvkC\ns\n\n\f810\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nfor some 0 < \u03b81 = \u03b81 (s, \u03b5) < 1.

Checking properties B5 and B6. We now move on to the task of\nproving that the operator T = RN of Theorem 2.4 satisfies properties B5 and\nB6 in the definition of robustness. Unlike the previous ones, the verification\nof these (last) two properties depends upon the geometry of the post-critical\nsets of maps near in A to the limit set K of T . The estimates performed here\nare the most delicate, and involve the results of \u00a75.2.\nRecall that T m is well-defined on an open set Om in the Banach space\nA = A\u03a9a (see \u00a73), which contains K. We shall denote the renormalization\nintervals \u22060,mN , \u22061,mN , . . . , \u2206p,mN simply by \u2206i = \u2206i,mN (this shortened\nnotation should cause no harm, because N is fixed since Theorem 2.4, and m\nwill be fixed in the particular estimates involving these intervals).\nWe can write the derivative of T m in the following form\nm\n\nDT (f )v = A(f )\n\np\u22121\nX\n\nBj (f ) * Cj (f ) + A(f ) * D(f )\n\np\u22121\nX\n\nE \u25e6 Bj (f ) * E \u25e6 Cj (f )\n\nj=0\n\nj=0\n\nwhere E is the evaluation map and\nA(f ) = (\u03bbf )\u22121 ,\nCj (f ) = v \u25e6 Up\u2212j\u22121 (f ) ,\n\nBj (f ) = f j\n\n\u0001\u2032\n\n\u25e6 Up\u2212j (f ) ,\n\nD(f ) = id * (f p )\u2032 \u25e6 U0 (f ) \u2212 \u03bbf * Up (f ) .\n\nTo carry out our estimates for T m , we shall use the operators Ui : f 7\u2192\n\u25e6 \u039bf (i \u2265 0). Note that U0 (f ) = \u039bf , hence U0 is C 1 in whichever space\nC r (I, I) we work in, because the scaling f 7\u2192 \u039bf is C 1 by Lemma 8.11.\nFirst we need some estimates for Ui .

This lemma follows from Lemma 8.14.\nNext, we show an essential result to prove that the renormalization operator satisfies properties B5 and B6.

Proof of Theorem 8.1. All the pieces of the puzzle may now be\nput together. We want to check the robustness of T relative to the spaces\nA = A, B = Ar , C = As and D = A0 . By Theorem 5.1, the pair (A\u03b3 , A0 )\nis \u03c1\u03b3 -compatible with (T, K) and \u03c1\u03b3 < \u03bb for \u03b3 sufficiently close to 2 and is\n1-compatible for \u03b3 > 2. Hence property B1 is satisfied because s > s0 with\ns0 < 2 close to 2 and r > s + 1 > 2. Since r > s + 1, we know from Lemma 8.12\nthat T satisfies property B2. It also satisfies property B3 by Lemma 8.13, and\nproperty B4 by Lemma 8.16. Finally, T satisfies property B5 by Theorem 8.20,\nand property B6 by Theorem 8.21. Therefore the renormalization operator T\nis indeed robust with respect to (Ar , As , A0 ).\n8.6. Proof of the hyperbolic picture. Having established that the renormalization operator T is robust, we are now ready to show that the hyperbolic\npicture holds true for T acting on each of the spaces Ur and Vr .\n8.6.1. Proof of Theorem 2.5. We divide the proof of Theorem 2.5 into two\ncases: (i) r is not an integer (including the Lipschitz case r = k + Lip), and\n(ii) r = k is an integer.\nProof of case (i). Putting together Theorem 6.1 with Theorem 8.1 we\ndeduce all the assertions of Theorem 2.5 except the fact that the holonomies\nare C 1+\u03b2 for some \u03b2 > 0. This last fact follows if we combine Theorem 7.1\nwith Example 7.1.\n\n\f816\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nProof of case (ii). To prove this case, let us consider the Banach space\nNote that the natural inclusion i : Ak \u2192 Ak\u22121+Lip is an isometric\nembedding. Indeed, for all v \u2208 Ak we have kvkC k = kvkB , by the mean-value\ntheorem. Applying case (i) to Ak\u22121+Lip , we see that for every g \u2208 K the\nlocal stable set W\u03b5s,k\u22121+Lip (g) is a codimension-one C 1 Banach submanifold of\nAk\u22121+Lip . In fact, there exists a C 1 function \u03a6 : O0 \u2192 R, where O0 \u2286 Ak\u22121+Lip\nis an open set containing g, such that 0 \u2208 R is a regular value for \u03a6, with\nAk\u22121+Lip .\n\n\u03a6\u22121 (0) = O0 \u2229 W\u03b5s,k\u22121+Lip(g)\nand such that D\u03a6(g)ug 6= 0. Let O1 = i\u22121 (O0 ) \u2286 Ak . Then O1 is open and\n\u03a6 \u25e6 i : O1 \u2192 R is C 1 . Since ug \u2208 Ak and D(\u03a6 \u25e6 i)(g)ug = D\u03a6(g)ug 6= 0, it\nfollows that 0 \u2208 R is a regular value for \u03a6 \u25e6 i at g. Hence, by the implicit\nfunction theorem,\nO1 \u2229 W\u03b5s,k (g) = O1 \u2229 W\u03b5s,k\u22121+Lip(g) = O1 \u2229 (\u03a6 \u25e6 i)\u22121 (0) ,\nis a C 1 , codimension-one Banach submanifold of Ak . Since by case (i) the\nlocal stable manifolds in Ak\u22121+Lip form a continuous lamination, we deduce\nthat the same is true for the local stable manifolds in Ak , because i is an\nisometric embedding. Finally, if F is a C 2 ordered transversal (in the sense of\n\u00a77) to the stable lamination in Uk , then i \u25e6 F is a C 2 ordered transversal to\nthe stable lamination in Ak\u22121+Lip , and therefore by case (i) its holonomy in\nUk\u22121+Lip is C 1+\u03b8 for some \u03b8 > 0. But then it follows that the holonomy of the\ntransversal F in Uk is C 1+\u03b8 also.\n8.6.2. Proof of Corollary 2.6. A similar argument to the one used in the\nproof of Theorem 2.5 can be used here. The map i is replaced throughout by\nthe inclusion j : Br \u2192 Ar , which is a bounded linear operator (see \u00a72.1). Hence\nthe pre-images by j of the local stable leaves in Ur are C 1 manifolds and form\na C 0 lamination in Vr . Using [24] (see Remark 9.1 below), we see that the\nleaves of such a lamination contain the local stable sets of each g \u2208 K in Vr .\n9. Global stable manifolds and one-parameter families\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 2.7. The first part will follow from\nTheorem 9.1 and the second part will follow from Theorem 9.2.\n9.1. The global stable manifolds of renormalization. In this section we\nconstruct the global stable manifolds of the renormalization operator T in Vr ,\nfor all r sufficiently large.\nLet g be an element of the (bounded-type) invariant set K of T . Recall\nthat the global stable set W s,r (g) of g \u2208 Vr is given by\nW s,r (g) = {f \u2208 Vr : kT n (f ) \u2212 T n (g)kC r \u2192 0 when n \u2192 \u221e} .\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n817\n\nFrom Corollary 2.6, we know that the convergence is exponential, and the\nexponential rate of convergence is independent of f and g, provided r \u2265 2 + \u03b1\nwith 0 < \u03b1 < 1 close to one.\nTheorem 9.1. For every r \u2265 3 + \u03b1 with \u03b1 < 1 sufficiently close to 1, and\nevery g \u2208 K, the global stable set W s,r (g) is an immersed, codimension one C 1\nBanach submanifold of Vr .\nRemark 9.1. By [24], if the invariant set K of the renormalization operator\nis of bounded type then for every r \u2265 3 and every g \u2208 K we have that W s,r (g)\ncoincides with the set of all maps f \u2208 Vr with the same combinatorial type\nof g.\nProof. We already know that the local stable sets are C 1 submanifolds.\nThe idea is to pull-back such a manifold structure by T using the implicit\nfunction theorem. More precisely, by Corollary 2.6 there exist \u03b5, \u03b2 > 0 so small\nthat W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (g) is a codimension one C 1 Banach submanifold of Vr\u22121\u2212\u03b2 , for\nall g \u2208 K. We may assume that \u03b5 > 0 is so small that the vector ug is\ntransversal to the local stable set W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (g) at each one of its points.\nNow fix g \u2208 K and let f \u2208 W s,r (g). There exists N = N (f ) > 0 so large\nthat\nT N (f ) \u2208 W\u03b5s,r (T N (g)) \u2282 W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (T N (g)) .\nSince v = uT N (g) is transversal at T N (f ) to W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (T N (g)), There exist a\nsmall open set O0 \u2282 Vr\u22121\u2212\u03b2 containing T N (f ) and a C 1 function \u03a6 : O0 \u2192 R\nsuch that \u03a6\u22121 (0) = W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (T N (g)) \u2282 O0 for which 0 \u2208 R is a regular\nvalue and D\u03a6(T N (f ))v 6= 0. The operator T N is C 1 as a map from Vr into\nVr\u22121\u2212\u03b2 . Let O1 \u2282 Vr be an open set containing f such that T N (O1 ) \u2282 O0 .\nWe want to show that 0 \u2208 R is a regular value for \u03a6 \u25e6 T N : O1 \u2192 R. Defining\nFt = T N (f ) + tv (for |t| small), we get a C 1 family {Ft } of maps in Vr which is\ntransversal to W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (T N (g)) at F0 = T N (f ). Now, we have the following\nclaim.\nClaim. There exists a C 1 family {ft } with ft \u2208 Vr such that for all small\nt we have T N (ft ) = Ft .\nLet us assume this claim for a moment. Setting\nw=\n\nd\ndt\n\nft ,\nt=0\n\nwe obtain that\nD(\u03a6 \u25e6 T N )(f )w = D\u03a6(F0 )v 6= 0 .\nTherefore, \u03a6 \u25e6 T N is a C 1 local submersion at f . By the implicit function\ntheorem (\u03a6 \u25e6 T N )\u22121 (0) is a codimension one, C 1 Banach submanifold of O1\n\n\f818\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\n(or Vr ). Furthermore, if h \u2208 (\u03a6 \u25e6 T N )\u22121 (0) then T N (h) \u2208 W\u03b5s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (T N (g)),\nand so h belongs to the global stable set W s,r\u22121\u2212\u03b2 (g). Using [24] (see Remark\n9.1), we deduce that h belongs in fact to W s,r (g). This proves that W s,r (g) is\nan immersed C 1 manifold as asserted.\nIt remains to prove the claim. We first note that Ft = ht \u25e6 F0 where each\nht \u2208 C r (I, I) is a C r diffeomorphism of I = [\u22121, 1]. Since T N (f ) = F0 , there\nexist p > 0 and closed, pairwise disjoint intervals 0 \u2208 \u22060 , \u22061 , . . . , \u2206p\u22121 \u2286 I\nwith f (\u2206i ) \u2286 \u2206i+1 for 0 \u2264 i < p \u2212 1 and f (\u2206p\u22121 ) \u2286 \u22060 , such that\np\nF0 = T N (f ) = \u039b\u22121\nf \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u039bf ,\n\nwhere \u039bf : I \u2192 \u22060 is the map x 7\u2192 f p (0)x. Let ht : \u22060 \u2192 \u22060 be the C r\nr\ndiffeomorphism given by ht = \u039bf \u25e6 ht \u25e6 \u039b\u22121\nf . Consider a C extension of ht to\na diffeomorphism Ht : I \u2192 I with the property that Ht |\u2206i is the identity for\nall i 6= 0. Then let ft \u2208 Vr be the map ft = Ht \u25e6 f . Note that fti (0) = f i (0)\nfor all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 p, that ft is N -times renormalizable (under T ) and that\np\nT N (ft ) = \u039b\u22121\nf \u25e6 ft \u25e6 \u039bf\n\n= \u039b\u22121\nf \u25e6 (Ht \u25e6 f ) |\u2206p\u22121 \u25e6 (Ht \u25e6 f ) |\u2206p\u22122 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 (Ht \u25e6 f ) |\u22060 \u25e6 \u039bf\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22121\n\u22121\np\np\n= \u039b\u22121\nf \u25e6 ht \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u039bf = \u039bf \u25e6 \u039bf \u25e6 ht \u25e6 \u039bf \u25e6 f \u25e6 \u039bf\n= ht \u25e6 F0 = Ft ,\n\nwhich proves the claim.\n9.2. One-parameter families. A one-parameter family of maps is a map\n\u03c8 : [0, 1] \u00d7 I \u2192 I (where I = [\u22121, 1] is the phase space) such that \u03c8t = \u03c8(t, *)\nbelongs to Vr for all t \u2208 [0, 1]. If \u03c8 is a C k map, then we say that \u03c8 is a C k\nfamily (of C r unimodal maps). We often identify the family \u03c8 with the curve\n{\u03c8t }0\u2264t\u22641 of unimodal maps in Vr . We shall denote by U F k the space of all\nC k families with the C k topology (U F k is a subset of C k ([0, 1] \u00d7 I)).\nWe say that two families are C 1+ equivalent if there exists a diffeomorphism from one into the other which sends each infinitely renormalizable map\n(with a fixed bounded combinatorial type) to a map with the same combinatorics. We are now in a position to state the result we have in mind.\nTheorem 9.2. Let r \u2265 3 + \u03b1 with \u03b1 > 0 close to 1, and let 2 \u2264 k \u2264 r.\nThere exists an open and dense subset O \u2286 U F k of one-parameter C k families\nof C r unimodal maps having the following properties:\n(i) Every family \u03c8 \u2208 O intersects the global stable lamination Ls of renormalization transversally.\n(ii) For every \u03c8 \u2208 O, there exist 0 = t0 < t1 < * * * < tn = 1 such that for each\ni = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 the sub-arc {\u03c8t : ti \u2264 t \u2264 ti+1 } is C 1+\u03b2 diffeomorphic,\nvia a holonomy-preserving diffeomorphism, to a corresponding sub-arc in\nthe quadratic family. Here \u03b2 > 0 is as given in Corollary 2.6.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n819\n\nThe proof will require a few lemmas. The first lemma says that every C k\nfamily can be approximated (in the C k sense) by a real analytic family.\nLemma 9.3. If \u03c8 \u2208 U F k , then for each \u03b5 > 0 there exists a real analytic\nfamily f \u2208 U F \u03c9 such that k\u03c8 \u2212 f kC k ([0,1]\u00d7I) < \u03b5.\nProof. Write each \u03c8t \u2208 Vr as ht \u25e6 q, where q(x) = x2 and ht is a diffeomorphism, and consider the C k map h : [0, 1] \u00d7 I \u2192 I given by h(t, x) = ht (x),\na C k family of C r diffeomorphisms. To approximate h by a real analytic\nfamily of diffeomorphisms, consider the convolution of h with the heat kernel\n2\n2\nk(t, x, \u03b5) = e\u2212(t +x )/4\u03b5 for \u03b5 > 0 sufficiently small (see [1]).\nGiven this \"denseness\" result, the idea will be to show that arbitrarily close\nto an f as in Lemma 9.3 we can find a C k family which is also transversal to the\nglobal stable lamination Ls of renormalization, by some kind of perturbation\nargument, to eliminate possible tangencies between {ft } and Ls .\nWe will reduce our problem to the following general result about laminations with complex analytic leaves, whose elegant proof is due to Douady.\nLemma 9.4. Let L \u2286 C2 be a C 0 lamination whose leaves are complex\none-manifolds, and let F : D \u2192 C be a holomorphic function whose graph is\ntangent of finite order at (0, F (0)) to a leaf L0 \u2208 L. Then the tangency is\nisolated: there exists a neighborhood of (0, F (0)) in C2 on which every other\nintersection of the graph of F with the leaves of L is a transversal intersection.\nProof. Using a suitable chart, we may assume that the leaf L0 is the\nhorizontal plane w = 0 in C2 , and that the other leaves of L in that chart are\nthe graphs of holomorphic functions \u03c6\u03bc : D \u2192 C (with \u03c6\u03bc (0) = \u03bc \u2208 D, where\nD \u2286 C is some open disk around zero, and \u03c60 \u2261 0).\nSince L is a C 0 lamination, \u03c6\u03bc converges to 0 uniformly in D as \u03bc tends\nto 0. Hence, for |\u03bc| small enough, we have \u03c6\u03bc (D) \u2282 D. Moreover, \u03c6\u03bc (z) 6= 0\nfor all z \u2208 D (leaves cannot intersect), so in fact \u03c6\u03bc (D) \u2282 D\u2217 .\nNow, we have F (0) = F \u2032 (0) = * * * = F (k\u22121) (0) = 0 6= F (k) (0), for some\nk \u2265 2. Composing the chart with a bi-holomorphic map if necessary, we may\ntherefore assume that F (z) = z k .\nLet us fix \u03bc \u2208 D \\ {0} and suppose that z0 \u2208 D is such that \u03c6\u03bc (z0 ) =\nF (z0 ). We assume that |z0 | < 1/2 (taking |\u03bc| small enough). To show that\nthis intersection between \u03c6\u03bc and F is transversal, it suffices to show that\n\u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) 6= F \u2032 (z0 ). But, by Schwarz's Lemma, the derivative \u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) measured\nwith respect to the Poincar\u00e9 metrics of domain D and range D\u2217 must be less\nthan or equal to 1, that is to say\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) 1 \u2212 |z0 |2\n\u0011 \u22641.\n\u0010\n\u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) P =\n|\u03c6\u03bc (z0 )| log |\u03c6\u03bc (z0 )|\u22121\n\n\f820\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\nThus,\n\u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) \u2264\nOn the other hand,\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n4\nk|z0 |k log |z0 |\u22121 .\n3\n\nF \u2032 (z0 ) = k|z0 |k\u22121 .\nThis shows that \u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) / |F \u2032 (z0 )| converges to 0 as \u03bc tends to 0, whence\n\u03c6\u2032\u03bc (z0 ) 6= F \u2032 (z0 ) for all sufficiently small |\u03bc|. Therefore (0, F (0)) is an isolated\ntangency as claimed.\nWe may now state and prove the result on laminations with real analytic\nleaves which is needed for the proof of Theorem 9.2.\nLemma 9.5. Let F \u2286 [a, b] \u00d7 R be a C 0 foliation whose leaves are the\ngraphs of real analytic functions \u03c6\u03bc : [a, b] \u2192 R with, say, \u03c6\u03bc (a) = \u03bc \u2208 [0, 1].\nLet L \u2286 F be a sub-lamination which is transversally totally disconnected (i.e.\nK0 = {\u03bc \u2208 [0, 1] : gr(\u03c6\u03bc ) \u2286 L} is a totally disconnected set). If F : [a, b] \u2192 R\nis a real analytic function whose graph is not a leaf, then\n(i) gr(F ) is tangent to F at only finitely many points;\n(ii) for all \u03b5 > 0 and all k \u2265 0, there exists a real analytic G : [a, b] \u2192 R such\nthat kF \u2212 GkC k < \u03b5 and all tangencies of gr(G) with F belong to F \\ L;\nin particular, gr(G) is transversal to L.\nProof. (i) Complexifying F (i.e. the leaves \u03c6\u03bc ) as well as F , we put\nourselves in the situation of Lemma 9.4. All tangencies are therefore isolated,\nand since [a, b] is compact, there are only finitely many such, say at xi \u2208 [a, b],\ni = 1, 2, . . . , n.\n(ii) Let di be the order of tangency of F with F at (xi , F (xi )). Then for\nevery real analytic G sufficiently close to F in the C k topology with k large (k \u2265\nPn\nof tangencies of gr(G) with F \u2013 not counting\ni=1 di will do), the number n(G)\nP\nmultiplicies \u2013 is bounded by ni=1 di . Hence we can find G0 : [a, b] \u2192 R real\nanalytic with kF \u2212 G0 kC k < \u03b5/2 such that n(G0 ) is maximal. All tangencies of\nG0 with F must be first-order tangencies (di = 1). Indeed, if, say, d1 > 1, then\nadding a suitable polynomial with small C k norm to G0 , vanishing of very high\norder at x2 , x3 , . . . , xn(G0 ) , we could unfold the tangency at x1 to produce a\nnew real analytic G with n(G) > n(G0 ). Now we may consider Gt : [a, b] \u2192 R\ngiven by Gt (x) = G0 (x) + t for |t| < \u03b5/2. Since first-order tangencies are\npersistent, each tangency (xi , G0 (xi )) of G0 with F generates a continuous,\nnonconstant path (xi (t), Gt (xi (t))) \u2208 gr(\u03c6\u03bci (t) ) of (first-order) tangencies of\nGt with F. Each function t 7\u2192 \u03bci (t), i = 1, 2, . . . , n(G0 ), is continuous and\nnonconstant. Since K0 is totally disconnected, there exists t (with |t| < \u03b5/2)\nsuch that \u03bci (t) \u2208 [0, 1] \\ K0 for all i. Therefore, all tangencies of Gt with F\nfall in F \\ L, whence Gt is transversal to L.\n\n\fGLOBAL HYPERBOLICITY OF RENORMALIZATION\n\n821\n\nProof of Theorem 9.2. Both properties (i) and (ii) are easily seen to be\nopen, hence we concentrate on proving that they are dense. Let \u03b5 > 0.\nTake any family \u03c8 \u2208 U F k . By Lemma 9.3, there exists a real analytic\nfamily f \u2208 U F \u03c9 whose C k distance from \u03c8 is less than \u03b5/2. The corresponding\ncurve {ft } in Vr may fail to be transversal to the global stable lamination Ls , so\nlet us show how to perturb it locally to get a transversal family. Let t0 \u2208 [0, 1]\nbe such that ft0 \u2208 Ls (and {ft } is tangent to Ls at ft0 ). Since ft0 is infinitely\nrenormalizable and real analytic, there exists N > 0 such that RN (ft0 ) \u2208 A\u03a9a\n(where a > 0 is the constant in Theorem 2.4). Let J \u2286 [0, 1] be an interval\ncontaining t0 such that RN (ft ) is well-defined and belongs to A\u03a9a for all t \u2208 J.\nWe restrict our attention to the sub-family {ft }t\u2208J from now on.\nFirst we embed {ft }t\u2208J in a two-parameter family in the following way.\nNote that each ft belongs to A\u03a9\u03b1 for some (fixed) \u03b1 > 0. As a map from (an\nopen subset of) A\u03a9\u03b1 into A\u03a9a , RN is a real analytic operator.\nClaim.\nThere exist analytic vectors v \u2208 A\u03a9\u03b1 and w \u2208 A\u03a9a with the\nproperty that DRN (ft0 )v = w and w is transversal to Lsa = Ls \u2229 A\u03a9a at\nRN (ft0 ) \u2208 Lsa .\nTo see this, take any w0 \u2208 A\u03a9a transversal to the (co-dimension one)\nlamination Lsa at RN (ft0 ). The same construction used in the proof of Theorem\n9.1 yields a C \u221e vector v0 at ft0 such that DRN (ft0 )v0 = w0 . Now approximate\nv0 by an analytic vector v \u2208 A\u03a9\u03b1 (in the C m sense for m \u2265 r). Then w =\nDRN (f0 )v will still be transversal to Lsa . Shrinking J if necessary, we may\nin fact assume that DRN (ft )v is transversal to Lsa for all t \u2208 J. Hence, we\nconsider the two-parameter family of maps ft,s \u2208 A\u03a9\u03b1 given by ft,s = ft + sv\nwith t \u2208 J and |s| \u2264 \u03b4 with \u03b4 small. Now,\nW = {ft,s : t \u2208 J, s \u2208 [\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4]} \u223c\n= J \u00d7 [\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4] \u2286 R2 ,\nand RN |W : W \u2192 A\u03a9a is an injective, real analytic map. Recall now that in\nA\u03a9a we have a C 0 foliation F with real analytic leaves (coming from hybrid\nclasses, cf. \u00a73) and that Lsa \u2286 F is the sub-lamination corresponding to the\nstable leaves of renormalization, which is transversally totally disconnected.\nTaking FW = R\u2212N (F) \u2286 W and LsW = R\u2212N (Lsa ) \u2286 W and noting that\nDRN (ft,s )v = w is transversal to Lsa for all t \u2208 J, s \u2208 [\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4] (making \u03b4 smaller\nif necessary) we deduce that FW is a C 0 foliation (in W ) by real analytic curves,\nand LsW \u2286 FW is a sub-lamination. Therefore we can apply Lemma 9.5 to this\nsituation (with F = FW and L = LsW ), obtaining a new analytic curve {gt }t\u2208J\nwith kft \u2212 gt kC k < \u03b5/2, transversal to LsW in W , and such that {RN (gt )} is\ntransversal to Lsa at RN (gt0 ). Since by Corollary 2.6 the holonomy of Lsa is\nC 1+\u03b2 for some \u03b2 > 0 (and the quadratic family is transversal to Lsa ) we deduce\nthat {gt } satisfies properties (a) and (b) of the statement. This completes the\nproof.\n\n\f822\n\nEDSON DE FARIA, WELINGTON DE MELO, AND ALBERTO PINTO\n\n10.
