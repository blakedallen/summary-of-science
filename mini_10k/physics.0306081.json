A reasonably complete damping model must use nonlinear terms in addition to the\ncommon linear viscous expression. In some cases a nonlinear substitute for assumed linear damping may\nbe more appropriate. Even for exceptional cases where all nonlinearity may be ignored, it is shown that\nviscous dissipation involves subtleties that can lead to huge errors when ignored.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n(Note: the use of the adjective, 'linear', in the title of this article -- is to be viewed only in the\nfollowing context -- for all cases considered, the amplitude of pendulum motion is small enough for\nreasonable validity of the approximation sin \u03b8 = \u03b8 .)\nPreface\nBecause of the complexities of friction, most models of oscillator damping concentrate on a single\nprocess. For harmonic motion at small amplitudes within a fluid, the simplest energy loss is viscous loss\nthat is proportional to the velocity. For an oscillating sphere, it is tempting to treat this friction as simply\nthe steady flow expression involving the viscosity of the fluid and the radius of the sphere (Stokes law).\nWe will see that such an approximation results in huge errors. Not only must one account for 'history\neffects' because of the repetitive motion, but estimates of the damping generally require a full nonlinear fit\nto decay records. The 'least' additional friction that must be included is that which depends on the square of\nthe velocity.\nThe 20th century began to reveal the importance of damping friction that is internal to the\nstructure of an oscillator. Just as the pendulum was an important instrument for the study of fluid (external)\nfriction, it is also vital to the study of internal friction. In studies of the pendulum, it has been common to\nrestrict one's attention to damping that derives only from the fluid. Or if the pendulum were envisaged as\nswinging in a vacuum -- to ignore any processes other than those localized at the axis; which is typically\neither a knife-edge or a flex-pivot. Both of these approaches are naive; it will be seen in the experiments\nthat follow, that a pendulum is generally influenced by mechanisms of both solid and fluid type, neither of\nwhich can be properly viewed as completely linear.\nBackground\nBefore the developments of deterministic chaos, there seemed to be an obsession with the\nharmonic (linear) oscillator.\nOur understanding of more realistic macroscopic vibrations improved\ndramatically with enlightenment concerning the importance of elastic nonlinearity.\nWhile the\ndevelopments of this period focused on elastic nonlinearity, there was little concern for a different type of\nnonlinearity that begs for more study--damping that is other than the classic examples which have been\nknown either for decades or centuries.\nEarly experiments demonstrated clearly that the linear approximations of common damping theory\nwere useless, when applied to certain classic motions. These include (i) moving in a fluid at higher\nReynolds number, where a term that is quadratic in the velocity must be added to the viscous friction\nnormally employed, and (ii) oscillations that involve sliding or rolling surfaces, where Coulomb's nonlinear\nfriction must be used; which considers only the algebraic sign of the velocity. More recently, there have\nbeen considerations for (iii) the specialized (human-adjustable) types of nonlinear 'damping' that derive\nfrom feedback, as in the van der Pol oscillator. We will later in this paper demonstrate how both of the\nnonlinear forms of fluid and Coulomb damping are frequently present in a single free-decay of a pendulum\n(along with exponential damping). Nonlinear fluid damping is most important early in the decay, and\nCoulomb damping is most important late in the decay. On the other hand, exponential damping is most\nimportant in the middle of the decay.\nBy swinging a pendulum in water, we will also show that the common linear viscous theory is\nsubject to serious misinterpration--by assuming that the damping coefficient is a constant independent of\n\n\ffluid density and the frequency of oscillation. Highlighting of this issue is in large measure possible\nbecause of another element of the study, which is described in the paragraphs which follow.\nThe present work is largely concerned with a very important, but mostly unknown, ubiquitous\nform of nonlinear damping. Following the example of those who were the first to note and to label it as\nuniversal [1], the present paper will formally refer to this damping as the 'universal internal friction of\nsolids'. Without the adjective 'universal', this label is analogous for solids to that which was employed for\nfluids by the person who was first to properly describe it [2]. What we call viscous or fluid friction, Sir\nStokes called 'internal friction of fluids'; moreover, what we call 'viscosity', he referred to as the 'index of\nfriction'. Why his preferences were lost to history is a curiosity unknown to this author.\nFor those engineers who discovered long ago that nature refuses to let them ignore it, the internal\nfriction of solids has been called 'hysteretic\" [3]. It has even found a prominent place in a part of 'big\nscience', where it is called 'structural damping' [4]. The last reference is to those whose passion is to\ndirectly observe gravitational waves with an interferometer. At LIGO, VIRGO, GEO600, and TAMA-mirrors hang from pendulum supports--and if it were possible, hysteretic damping would be eliminated\nfrom them; so that thermal noise of their detector would be significantly reduced.\nStudies by the present author have also uncovered (at relatively low-energies of a pendulum)\nfeatures of hysteretic-related damping that manifest themselves through discontinuous jumps [5]. These\nare reminiscent of the Portevin LeChatelier effect, which is likely related to the better known (at least to old\nphysicists) Barkhausen effect. The damping in this regime is more properly labeled 'complex' than simply\n'nonlinear'. For systems that dwell in the 'low and slow' (small energy, long period) world of a pendulum,\nmesoanelastic complexity can be the basis for bizarre behavior [6].\nDebate continues as to whether hysteretic damping is really linear or nonlinear (since much\nadditional study is needed for a definitive proof). Engineers have usually chosen to include hysteretic\ndamping in their models by way of an artificial 'equivalent viscous' form. Nevertheless, because the\ndamping can be understood in terms of secondary creep of the pendulum structure [7]; hysteretic damping\nis most naturally cast in nonlinear form [8]. The same nonlinear mathematical form that is well-suited to its\ndescription, will be seen to naturally accommodate, in a single equation, the other commonly encountered\ntypes of oscillator damping.\nA factor in the linear/nonlinear controversy involves the shape of the decay curve--being\nexponential for hysteretic damping, the same as viscous damping. It should be noted, however, and as will\nbe discussed in detail later; there is a significant difference in the frequency dependence of damping that is\nexternal (viscous), as opposed to internal to the oscillator (hysteretic). Moreover, it will be seen that the\nfrequency dependence of linear fluid damping is significantly different from common assumptions. For a\npendulum swinging in water, the Q variation with frequency was found to depart radically from what is\nusually assumed. Perhaps a similar result is true for motion in air, but this would be more difficult to\ndemonstrate.\nIn the experimental results which follow, a heuristic 'universal' model of nonlinear damping will\nbe presented. Output generated by a single one of its pieces shows the characteristics of exponential\n'hysteretic' damping . Likewise, other individual pieces generate each of the other common forms of\ndamping: (i) exponential linear, (ii) amplitude-dependent (nonlinear fluid), and (iii) Coulomb. For this\nreason, and especially because it readily accommodates the important universal form of damping in solids\n(hysteretic), the model is itself described as universal. Because of its significant similarity to Coulomb\ndamping, it is also frequently referred to as a 'modified Coulomb' model.\nCompound Pendulum Experiment\nA compound pendulum was studied in free-decay. It is a pendulum supported by small, lowfriction, precision ball-bearings that define the axis of rotation; and which were chosen to insure a\ndetectable, though minimal amount of Coulomb friction. It was essential to this study that the frequency\nof oscillation be variable; this was accomplished by adding to the usual lower mass, a position-adjustable\nmass located above the axis.\nAt all times during the decay, position of the pendulum was determined with a highly linear and\nsensitive detector, which provides a measurement that is virtually noninvasive, over a large dynamic range.\nUse of the caveat, 'virtual', here draws attention to the fact that a perfect measurement is impossible. As\ndiscussed later in this article (damping redshift), even 'classical' measurements (in addition to well known\nquantum cases) are not always immune to difficulty. There is at least one example from classical physics\nwhere an attempted meaningful measurement is met instead with a signifcant (state altering) disturbance to\n\n\fthe system which is the object of the study. It occurs when one tries to accurately measure electrical\npotentials on a set of small capacitors. Anyone who has tried to do so will quickly acquire admiration for\nMichael Faraday.\nIn the present studies, although amplitude of motion was small, relative to restoration nonlinearity;\nit was nevertheless large enough for nonlinear viscous damping to be visually evident in the early portions\nof many records. A typical free-decay record would thus show apparent evidence for (i) non-viscous (high\nReynolds number) fluid friction in the early-part, (ii) exponential decline in the mid-part, and (iii) Coulomb\ndecay in the end-part of the decay.\nThe importance of a given type of damping will be shown to depend on both (i) frequency of\noscillation, and (ii) time in the free-decay at a given frequency. At higher frequencies, where viscous\nfriction is more important, it was discovered that the textbook form of viscous damping can lead to\nmeaningless conclusions. Huge errors result when one assumes the damping coefficient is a constant.\nRather (as known to some engineers), it was found that the damping coefficient depends significantly on\nthe density of the fluid as well as its viscosity (and also the frequency of oscillation). The dependence on\ndensity and frequency of oscillation, as well as viscosity, is a consequence of harmonic disturbance to the\nfluid by the oscillating pendulum. The simple Stokes law form of viscous drag (to which the proper\nfriction term reduces in the limit of zero frequency) applies only to steady flow.\nThe study also shows that hysteretic damping is the dominant source of dissipation at low\nfrequencies of oscillation, because of structural anelasticity. Whereas this was already known by the author\nto be true for the case of a pendulum swinging in air, the same result was found for motion in water. It is\ndoubtful that most would anticipate this surprising result.\nData Processing\nOutput from the sensor of the pendulum was converted from analog to digital form and stored in\nthe computer for analysis. In every trial, decay of the motion was viewed until such time as noise was of\ncomparable size to the signal. It was found that working with signals of abbreviated duration can result in\nserious misinterpretation. Such errors of judgment are no doubt a factor in many false conclusions that\nappear to characterize the world of damping science.\nOutput from the sensor was used to compare turning-point (pendulum amplitude) data against\ncorresponding model generated numbers produced with a computer. In the process of refining the method,\nthe following conclusion was reached. Just as a full decay record is essential, as noted above; so also, a\nproper interpretation of the decay requires a full-nonlinear fit to the data. The importance of a full-fit is\nillustrated in the following confession by the author. Yielding to a temptation that is probably\ncommonplace, he tried to estimate the viscous component of damping by restricting attention to the 'tail' of\nthe decay record. To focus on a portion of the record seemed reasonable, since the early and obvious\ninfluence of quadratic-in-the-velocity fluid friction has by then apparently 'died away'. It was not realized\nuntil later, following proper treatment -- that 'fits to the tail' are highly sensitive to one's choice of 'initial'\ncondition. Because the starting value of such a tail-fit is ill-defined, the results led to unrealistic\nconclusions, which at the time seemed quite reasonable.\nPrerequisites\nThis study could only be realized because of three high-technology experimental components : (i)\nan inexpensive, yet powerful personal computer, (ii) an adequate, yet still user-friendly analog-to-digital\n(A/D) converter with powerful software support, and (iii) a recently developed, superior sensor technology.\nThe large number of sample points necessary for proper evaluation of a decay record makes the\ncomputer indispensible. It is easy to see why Stokes' appeal (in 1850) for more 'decrement of the arc'\nmeasurements in support of his theoretical analyses --probably lacked for enthusiastic volunteers.\nPractically speaking, the absence of any one of the elements mentioned above would have caused the\npresent study to be impossible.\n\nFLUID FRICTION THEORY\nIn his seminal 1850 paper [2], Sir George Gabriel Stokes introduced his now famous law of\nviscous damping. Among other firsts, the theory of Stokes showed why raindrops in clouds are able to\npersist--since the force of the air acting on a drop depends on the radius of the small water sphere, rather\nthan on its surface area. His insight corrected an error in the 'common theory' which had prevailed to that\n\n\fpoint in time. It is noteworthy that this foundational work centered on one of the oldest instruments of\nexperimental science, the pendulum.\nDiscussed in nearly every textbook of physics, the simple form of Stokes law of friction force f is\nwritten\n\nf = 6\u03c0\u03b7 a v\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich involves the radius a of the sphere, moving at constant speed v, in an incompressible fluid of\nviscosity \u03b7 . Curiously, Stokes coined an alternative expression-- 'index of friction'--why it is obscure in\nthe history of physics is surprising and unknown to the author.\nFew recognize that the steady flow expression (Eq. 1) is inadequate when the sphere executes\nharmonic motion. For the harmonic cases of present interest, a 'history term' must be added to Eq. 1 to\nyield\n\nf harmonic = 6\u03c0\u03b7 a (1 + CH\n\na\n)v ,\n\u03b4\n\n\u03b4 =\n\n2\u03b7\n,\n\u03c9\u03c1\n\n( CH \u2192 1 as v \u2192 0)\n\n(2)\n\nThus, in addition to the viscosity, the harmonic viscous friction force involves the 'penetration depth' \u03b4;\nwhich itself depends on the angular frequency \u03c9 of oscillation, and the density \u03c1 of the fluid [9]. Through\ncomparisons of theory and experiment, a validation of Eq. 2 is later provided. Probably as a surprise to\nmost, it will be shown that commonly encountered cases yield a \u03b4 that is smaller than a by roughly an\norder of magnitude. In other words, viscous harmonic friction can be much greater than steady flow\nviscous friction ! When this is the case, the retarding force is proportional to the area of the sphere rather\nthan being proportional to its radius.\n\nEQUATIONS OF MOTION\nTraditional Damped Harmonic Oscillator\nThe simplest equation to approximate the free-decay of most oscillators is the following famous\nexpression:\n\n&x& +\n\n\u03c9\nx& + \u03c9 2 x = 0\nQ\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the damping term has been written in 'canonical' form by means of the quality factor Q. For systems\nwith fairly small damping, Q is defined as 2\u03c0E/|\u2206\u0395|, where E is the energy of oscillation and \u2206\u0395 is the\nenergy lost per cycle because of dissipation. More commonly, the dissipation is expressed in terms of a\ndamping coefficient \u03b2, where\n\n2 \u03b2 x& =\n\n\u03c9\nx& .\nQ\n\n(4)\n\nAlthough the damping coefficient is oftentimes called a damping 'constant', it will be later shown, using Eq.\n2, that this coefficient involves the density of the fluid and the frequency of oscillation.\nUsing the period T = 2\u03c0 /\u03c9, the logarithmic decrement of the motion is given by\n\n\u03b4 = \u03b2T =\n\n\u03c0\n.\nQ\n\nHighly touted, but irrelevant Damping redshift\n\n(5)\n\n\fIn textbooks, a subscript 0 is usually associated with \u03c9 in Eq. 3, because of the damping 'redshift'\ninherent to its mathematical solution. For the present (and possibly every) situation, the subscript is\ndeemed unnecesary for the reasons that follow.\nTo his knowledge, the author alone has seriously treated the difficulty of measuring the damping\nshift, which is conveniently expressed in terms of the Q as\n\n\u2206\u03c9\n1\n=\u2212 2\n\u03c9\n8Q\n\n.\n\n(6)\n\nThe effect does not even exist to begin with, in the case of hysteretic damping (discussed later), and it is\ntoo small to permit experimental validation--except, perhaps, through the employment of Herculean efforts.\nConsider, for example, the smallest Q encountered in the present experiments, having the value of about\n10. According to Eq. 6, the magnitude of the expected shift, in this largest of all the cases studied, is only\n0.125 %. Such a small change in frequency for a short-duration signal is difficult to measure by either of\ntwo methods that were attempted by the author with students, using the experiment that is next described.\nIn lieu of a pendulum, where control of the damping parameter is difficult, an RLC oscillator in\nfree-decay was studied, using fixed L and C, and a variable resistance R. Individual decay records were\ncaptured with a Tektronix digital oscilloscope and then exported to Microsoft Excel for detailed analysis.\nThe experiment yielded the following conclusions.\n(i) Use of spectral measurement techniques (involving the fast Fourier transform, or FFT) do not\nwork for reason of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As resistance is increased to enlarge the effect,\n'lifetime' shortening of the waveform becomes a serious detriment; i.e., concomitant linewidth broadening\ndisallows the shift to be resolved.\n(ii) Use of computer fits to the data prove no better, for reason of noise associated with bandwidth\nfeatures of the oscilloscope. Reducing the lifetime of the signal requires an increase in the bandwidth of\nthe recording instrument, lest the signal become distorted. The concomitant increase in Johnson noise\nbecomes detrimental to this measurement. This limitation became evident in the noise-reduced quality of\nresiduals-- difference between data and a theory-generated best-fit to the data.\n\nThe Pendulum--where Linear Approximations are insufficient\nEq. 3 is attractive because of its simplicity; it is especially simple as here presented, where\nattention to the inconsequential damping redshift has been omitted. Because it is a linear equation, it\ncannot be used to describe a host of increasingly important phenomena, some of which can be studied\nmeaningfully with the pendulum [10]. The present work demonstrates that nonlinearity is important not\nonly to pendulum restoration, but also to pendulum damping. Whereas pendulum damping of nonlinear\nviscous type is fairly well known, other important nonlinear types are not.\nLarge -amplitude Pendulum\nThe driven, rigid simple pendulum with linear damping has become an archetype of chaos [11].\nThe equation of motion for its angular displacement \u03b8, when driven by an external torque \u03c4d at frequency\n\u03c9d is\n\nI\u03b8&& +\n\n\u03c9I &\n\u03b8 + Mg\u2206 sin \u03b8 = \u03c4 d sin \u03c9 d t\nQ\n\n,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere I is the moment of inertia, and \u2206 is the distance of the center of mass from the axis. The restoration\nis seen to be nonlinear, because of the sine term. It is necessary for chaos. The damping term is linear,\nbeing proportional to the angular velocity. For the case of Mercer's online chaotic pendulum, this is a\nreasonable approximation, because most of its damping derives from eddy currents of an aluminum disc\nthat is connected to the pendulum, and which moves between magnets.\nSmall-Amplitude Pendulum in Free-decay\n\n\fUnlike pendulum motion-past-vertical, which is necessary for chaos; all present experiments involved\namplitudes sufficiently small that sin \u03b8 may be replaced by \u03b8 in Eq. 7. (We will see that the elastic\nnonlinearity remains observable (using residuals) for motion at some of these lower levels; but its\nmagnitude is not consequential, as compared to damping nonlinearity.) Additionally, the pendulum was\nstudied in free-decay, so that \u03c4 d of Eq. 7 is zero, and the equation in turn reduces to the equivalent of Eq. 3.\nHeuristic Universal form of Pendulum (Mechanical Oscillator) Damping\nWhat has been discovered through present and previous experiments by the author, is that Eq. 3 is\nrarely an adequate description of pendulum motion, even at amplitudes where concerns for isochronism is\nnot an issue. To correct the observed deficiencies, the following nonlinear equation was developed.\nThrough a large number of tests, involving various types of pendula with differing dissipation\ntypes, the efficacy of the following equation has been demonstrated (c.f., reference 8). Later in this\ndocument, the usefulness of Eq. 8 for deciphering experimental observations will be further illustrated with\nsome examples.\n\n&x& + [\n\n\u03c0\u03c9 2 \u03c0\u03c9\n\u03c0\n\u03c9\n(\u03c9 2 x + x& 2 )] sgn( x& ) +\nx& + \u03c9 2 x = 0\n+\n\u03c9 2 x + x& 2 +\n4Qc 0 4Qh\n4 y0 Q f 0\nQv\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nOf the four damping terms in Eq. 8, the last one is traditional (linear) viscous, and the three inside\nthe brackets are nonlinear because of the signum (sgn) function which operates on the velocity.\nRespectively, from left to right, the bracketed terms model friction of the type that is: (i) Coulomb, (ii)\nhysteretic, and (iii) amplitude dependent (or 'fluidic'). As presented, both the hysteretic damping and the\namplitude dependent damping can be justifiably labeled with the generic term, 'modified Coulomb'\ndamping. They may be thought of as a friction force where the 'coefficient' is energy dependent, as\nopposed to being the kinetic constant used to treat contacting surfaces where there is relative, sliding\nmotion.\nIt is important to note that only hysteretic damping and viscous damping are characterized by a\nconstant Q. Also, in the case of amplitude-dependent damping of Eq. 8-- although it may be called\n'fluidic', because of similarity to nonlinear fluid damping; the terminology can be misleading. Fluid\nviscosity has no physical basis for those cases where the dissipation involves the rearrangement of\ncrystalline defects in the structure of the solid.\nIt is also worthy of note that each of the bracketed parts can be written as a force per unit mass, in\nterms of the energy as\n\u03bb\n\nf\n\u03c0\u03c9\n\uf8eb 2E \uf8f6\n=c\uf8ec\n=\n[ v]\n2 \uf8f7\nm\n4Q\n\uf8ed m\u03c9 \uf8f8\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nwhere c is a constant. For Coulomb damping \u03bb = 0, for hysteretic damping \u03bb = 1/2, and for fluidic\ndamping \u03bb = 1. Some yet-to-be discovered damping type may take advantage of an altogether different\nvalue of \u03bb.\nIt is also seen from Eq. 9 that the friction can be expressed in terms of a square wave velocity, [v],\nwhich corresponds to the fundamental component of a Fourier series expansion of the oscillator's actual\nvelocity. (For a square wave +h, the amplitude of the fundamental is +(4/\u03c0)h.) We thus see that all\ndamping which involves harmonic oscillation, when expressed in canonical form, is of the form f =\nm\u03c9v/Q. The simplicity of this result is probably why viscous damping has been viewed by so many as\n'inviolate'. One must exercise care, however, because only for the case of hysteretic and viscous damping\nis Q constant. If we designate the amplitude of the motion by y, and indicate initial values with the\nsubscript 0; then for amplitude-dependent damping Qf = Qf 0(y0/y). For Coulomb damping Qc = Qc 0(y/ y0).\nThus the Q of hysteretic damping increases with time, whereas the Q of Coulomb damping decreases wtih\ntime.\n\n\fThe net Q of the oscillator, when all damping types are simultaneously active, is expressible in the\nform\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n+\n+\nQ Qc (t ) Qh Q f (t ) Qv\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nThis equivalence to the manner in which capacitors in series combine should not be surprising; the smallest\nQ of the system is most important to the energy loss.\nThe primary difference between hysteretic and viscous damping involves their frequency\ndependence. It is not difficult to show from Eq. 8, that for hysteretic damping\n\nQh \u221d \u03c9 2\n\n(hysteretic)\n\n( 10 )\n\nIt is popularly and erroneously believed that the Q of viscous damping is always proportional to the first\npower of the frequency. This would be true if the damping coefficient were constant, which it is not. In\nthe water-damping results which follow, it was found that the exponent was different according to which\nconfiguration of the pendulum was used\n\nQv \u221d \u03c9\n\nx\n\n, x \u2248 - 5.6 , high freq.\n, x \u2248 0.50 , low freq.\n\n(linear viscous)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nThe low frequency configuration used a pair of weights on the pendulum rod--one above, as well as below\nthe axis of the pendulum; whereas the low-frequency configuration used only the lower weight.\nEq. 11 illustrates a confusion factor associated with the common method for specifying internal\nfriction; i.e., as 1/Q. The quality factor of an oscillator formally has meaning only as it is presently\ndefined. The Q involves more than just the 'loss tangent' associated with stress-strain hysteresis; its\nfrequency variation also involves restoration properties of the oscillator. Although many experimenters\nchoose to designate their measured loss tangent by 1/Q, the practice is misleading. The resulting confusion\nfor hysteretic damping of a pendulum is discussed in detail in [12].\nThe functional form of Eq. 10 is especially significant to two modern experiments: (i) torsion\npendulum measurements of Newton's universal gravitational constant, G [c.f., 13], and (ii) LIGO's search\nfor gravitational waves, in which a given mirror of the interferometer is supported as a high Q pendulum.\nIn [4] one reads the following statement: \"The quality factor (Q) of the IP is compatible with structural\ndamping. Q is proportional to the square of the pendulum frequency\".\n\nBasis for Curve Fits\nFor purpose of computer generated curves to compare theory with experiment, it is necessary to\nobtain a mathematical representation, consistent with Eq. 8, for the turning points of the pendulum. Such\nan expression is generated from the time dependence of pendulum energy [8]:\n\nE& = \u2212(c1 + c2 E + c3 E ) E\n\n,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere each of the C 's is a constant. Both hysteretic and viscous damping.are accommodated by the\nconstant C2 . Any non-zero Coulomb damping is represented by C1 , and C3 is for any amplitudedependent damping that might be present ( high Reynolds number cases, or some types of internal friction\nin solids ). Superposition of the energy parts is used in writing Eq. 12, even though nonlinear mathematics\ndoes not in general permit it.\nEq. 12 provides the first order differential equation for the turning points (corresponding to\nmaximum displacement = amplitude y), by recognizing that energy is proportional to y2. Thus, Eq. 12\nyields\n\n\u2212 y& = ay 2 + by + c\n\n,\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhere the three constants a, b, and c are various mixtures of the constants of Eq. 12.. The choice of\nsymbols a, b, and c allows convenient association with the well-known positive root of the quadratic\nequation of algebra. Thus the solution to Eq. 13 is obtained from integral tables in terms of r =\n\nb 2 \u2212 4ac as\n\ny=\n\nb( p \u2212 1) + r ( p + 1)\n,\n2a (1 \u2212 p )\n\np =\n\n2ay0 + b \u2212 r \u2212 r t\ne\n,\n2ay0 + b + r\n\n(14)\n\nwhere it is required that r be real ( thus c < b2/4a ). Although an alternative solution could be written for\ncases of large Coulomb damping (determined by c), Eq. 14 is the appropriate solution for present purposes.\nAmplitude-dependent damping is contained in the constant a, and hysteretic and/or viscous (linear)\ndamping are contained in b.\n\nQuality Factor\nOnce the parameters a, b, and c of the decay have been estimated, using the method described\nlater, the Q of the oscillator (time dependent for non-zero a and c) is calculated from the frequency f using\n\nQ=\n\n\u03c0 f\nc\n( ay + b + )\ny\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nEXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS\nThe pendulum used in these studies is pictured in Fig. 1. As noted earlier, bearings were purposely\nselected, instead of a knife edge for the pendulum axis, to provide minimal Coulomb friction, in addition to\nother types of damping normally active in the pendulum. The pair of ball-bearings (System Management\nAssociates, Inc, Box 957, Palo Alto 94302, part No. 628) are located in the arms of a y-shaped plastic\nhousing that is mounted with a bolt to the gear-moveable platform (via the knurled knob), which rides on\nthe support post of square cross-section. (For present experiments, this geared degree of freedom was not\nneeded).\n\n\fFigure 1. Compound pendulum showing five different masses that could be used in a variety of\nconfigurations.\nIn addition to the dark-colored ping-pong ball and the cue-ball resting on the floor, three other masses are\npresent in the picture, mounted on the rod. At the bottom of the rod is a nearly spherical lead mass which\ncan be attached and detached with a screw. At the top is a detachable light-weight, large-diameter hollow\nmetal ball; and between this pair is a lead weight (711 g) whose position can be changed by means of its\nwing-nut clamp. Not all the objects shown in the figure were used in the data presently described.\nThe hollow rod which holds the masses was once a lightweight aluminum alloy arrow, whose total\nmass with additional components is now 44.4 g, and whose length is 77 cm. The fletching and end-nocking\nplastic pieces were cut away from the arrow, and it was squeezed flat using a vise, in a central region about\n10 cm long, except for a small section at the geometric center. At this center, a through-hole was drilled to\naccommodate the small brass pin, whose ends are located (operationally) in the inner race of the ball\nbearings. After assembly, this pin was glued in place to the rod.\nA semicircular piece of single-sided printed circuit board was also epoxied to the flatted portion of\nthe rod to serve as the moving electrode of the sensor. To strengthen the hollow rod at the transition\nbetween its circular and flat regions, epoxy was added. To insure an equipotential throughout the moving\nelectrode that comprises PCB and flatted section of the arrow, paint was scraped from the arrow and silver\npaint was added to insure electrical contact between the arrow and the copper of the board.\n\n\fSensor\nThe photograph of the pendulum in Fig. 2 is a closeup which focuses on the symmetric\ndifferential capacitive (SDC) sensor and its electronics support [14].\n\nFigure 2. Closeup of the sensor and its support electronics.\nClearly visible in Fig. 2 is one of the pair of static electrodes of the sensor, which are positioned\non opposite sides of the rotating electrode. These are not the full circle type that would permit angle\nmeasurement of + \u03c0/2; since the plastic part which holds the pair of ball-bearings disallows motion larger\nthan about +0.7 rad.\n\n\fOn the side of the post opposite the sheet copper electrodes, and supported by a single small screw\nat its upper left, is the circuit board (dim. 4.5 cm x 9 cm) on which are installed electronic components used\nby the sensor. These include a quad-opamp and NE5521N integrated circuit chips. The banana plugs\nthrough which electrical power is supplied to the board from a power supply (not shown) are visible in Fig.\n1.\nSeen also with the sensor in Fig. 2 is a Dataq DI154-RS analog-to-digital converter. Being limited\nto 12-bit resolution, this converter was replaced for present experiments with a 16-bit unit (not shown,\nDataq's DI-700) that operates through the USB of the computer.\nAlso not shown in the figures is the tall nylon shroud that was used to shield the instrument from\nair currents when operating at long periods, where the sensitivity is great. This shroud was fabricated from\ntwo barrels, one of which had both ends removed using a skil-saw. The 2nd, half-length barrel sits on top\nof the open-end cylinder; which itself surrounds the pendulum, which during operation, sat on a sturdy\nlaboratory table.\n\nSensor Calibration Results\nSensor linearity is a requirement of great importance for work of present type. Shown in Fig. 3\nare the results of calibration (small displacement data), which clearly demonstrate that the requirement was\nmet for the range considered by the figure. Although the sensor was crudely constructed, its linearity was\nfound to be excellent over the full range of displacements considered in the study. The precision data of\nFig. 3 were obtained with a digital vernier caliper. Although it was not possible to calibrate the sensor with\nthis great a precision at angles beyond those of the figure, the indicated 3.85 V/rad is stated with confidence\nfor all data taken.\n\nFigure 3. Sample calibration results for the capacitive sensor. The detector's response was determined\nto be constant at 3.85 V/rad over + 0.6 rad (larger than the range of the figure by an order of magnitude).\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nBenchmark of Internal Friction -- Low Frequency Motion in Air\nEven Stokes recognized that internal friction of the pendulum could not be ignored, and he talks\nabout the matter in his 1850 paper [2]. For the simple pendulum, internal friction will not be as significant\nas for a compound pendulum like the present instrument. An attempt to 'benchmark' the hysteretic\ncomponent is important for the identification of damping types (similar, in principle, to determining\nbackground in nuclear experiments).\nNumerous investigations by the author and by others have shown that internal friction of\nhysteretic type is the dominant source of dissipation in any long-period mechanical oscillator. A seminal\n\n\fpaper might have prevented this important fact from having to be rediscovered--had the 1927 work of\nKimball and Lovell become better known [1]. The frequency dependence of pendulum Q for hysteretic\ndamping (noted in Eq. 10 ) is consistent with the 1927 discovery.\nKimball and Lovell used neither a pendulum nor any other type of oscillator for their work; rather\nthey devised a clever technique which measured the transverse deflection of a rod. When hysteresis due to\nanelasticity is present, a rotating rod will experience, in addition to the primary deflection which results\nfrom an end-applied bending force--an additional deflection that is transverse to the first. In showing that\nthe resulting transverse deflection was independent of the rate of rotation (and thus frequency), they were\nfirst to determine that the internal friction of solids is functionally different from the internal friction of\nfluids. Stokes was the first to properly describe the internal friction of fluids 77 years earlier. Kimball and\nLovell chose to label the damping they had discovered as 'universal' to solids, and their claim has been\nsubstantiated by recent experiments. Perhaps this choice caused them to be perceived by their peers as\narrogant, so that the paper was poorly received. Whatever the cause, their work did not receive the\nprominence that it deserves, until the 1990's.\nShown in Fig. 4 are the present benchmark results, which are seen to be in agreement with\nhysteretic (internal friction) damping theory, as evidenced by the straight line of Q versus the square of the\nfrequency. As noted earlier, one is not forced to assume a nonlinear damping model, to obtain agreement\nof the type provided by the figure. An equivalent viscous damping model would also suffice, where one\nartifically divides the usual viscous damping coefficient by \u03c9. To do so is questionable, however; since its\nphysical basis is unjustified. By contrast, the proper frequency dependence is automatic with Eq. 8.\n\nFigure 4. Illustration of hysteretic damping of the pendulum, for oscillation at low-frequency in air.\nFor the data of Fig. 4, the pendulum was swung with two masses--the pair shown mounted on the\npendulum in Fig. 1, but with the large hollow sphere removed. The highest frequency included in the\nfigure corresponds to a period of approximately 2 s. This is a shorter period than would normally still\ncorrespond so strongly to internal friction damping--except that here the pendulum rod is relatively weak\nfor the size of weights employed (and thus deflects significantly). If the rod were more rigid, viscous\ndamping would already have shown its presence, once the period had been adjusted downward from 15 s\ntoward 2 s.\nEven a simple rod pendulum, constructed of malleable metal, can also be configured to exhibit\ndamping of the Fig. 4 type, as shown in reference 10. Deviations from the smooth decay curves of the\npresent study are also possible, when working with a ductile metal. Similar bizarre behavior is encountered\nwhen one studies pendulum motion at very small amplitudes, in the realm of mesoanelastic complexity [5].\n\n\fOscillation in Water\nFor these experiments, a wooden sphere (dia 3.79 cm, mass 35.8 g with screw) was attached to the\nbottom of the pendulum rod with a 10-32 screw that had been reduced in a lathe to a small diameter for the\nportion that moves in water. A rectangular plastic container (11 cm x 23 cm x 5 cm) was placed and filled\nwith enough water for the sphere to remain completely submerged in its motion along the direction of the\nlong axis of the container. Physical constraints disallowed the path of the motion to be centered with\nrespect to the 11 cm dimension; rather the sphere was offset by 1.5 cm.\nThe bottom lead sphere pictured in Fig. 1 had been replaced for these measurements with another\nlead weight (993 g) that could be clamped (like the upper lead weight) at any position on the rod below the\naxis. This change was made so that a smooth progression in frequency, from low to high, could be\naccomplished by adjusting both weights.\nEstimating the influence of theViscous Damping Coefficient \u03b4\nTo estimate the damping coefficient \u03b4, Equations 2 and 3 were first combined (after rewriting in\nthe form appropriate to a pendulum). This gives the following equation for the Q of oscillation, as\ndetermined solely by linear viscous damping. (We will later discuss the manner in which the viscous part\ncan be extracted from a full nonlinear fit to the data.)\n\nQv =\n\nI\u03c9\na\n6\u03c0 \u03b7 a (1 + ) L2\n\u03b4\n\n, \u03b4 =\n\n2\u03b7\n\u03c9\u03c1\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nHere L = 45.2 cm (distance from axis to center of sphere of radius a = 1.90 cm), and I is the moment of\ninertia. Governed by the position of the weights on the rod (same being true of the center of mass); there is\na unique moment for each of the fifteen frequencies that were considered in the water study. The value of I\nfor a given \u03c9 was determined by both (i) direct computation using measured distances for the known\nweight masses, and (ii) indirect theoretical estimation, accounting for water influence on frequency through\nthe effects of 'buoyancy' and 'added mass' [9]. Reasonable self-consistency was found for the two methods.\nFig. 5 shows the importance to the calculation of buoyancy and added mass, whose influence on frequency\nis large because of the large density of water.\n\n\fFigure 5. Theoretical estimate for the influence on pendulum frequency (period lengthening) due to\nbuoyancy and added mass of the water.\nThe dramatic importance of the history term a/\u03b4 of Eq. 16 is illustrated in Fig. 6. To assume simple Stokes\nlaw viscous damping (which applies only at zero frequency) is to underestimate the damping by 1000 to\n3000 %.\n\nFigure 6. Theoretical estimates for the viscous damping limit for pendulum motion in water, with and\nwithout correction. The curves of Log Q (base 10) are for the two frequency branches considered in the\nstudy.\nDecay Records\n\n\fOf the fifteen decay records of the water study, a typical one is provided in Fig. 7; where the\ndisplayed ordinate is in terms of sensor output voltage. With the sensor calibration constant of 3.85 V/rad,\nit is recognized that the initial amplitude of the motion for this decay was 68 mrad.\n\nFigure 7. Typical free-decay record showing the influence of nonlinear damping.\nThe figure was generated by 'copy and paste' from Excel to Paint, after the nonlinear curve fit had been\nmanaged in Excel. The A/D converter data had been originally stored in Dataq's software package,\nwindaq32.exe. From there it was saved in spreadsheet (*.csv) format for export to the Excel spreadsheet.\nSpreadsheet generation of the fit was accomplished by 'eyeball' optimization, through trial and\nerror adjustment of the three parameters a, b and c. This proved user friendly and powerful for Pentium II\nand later computers, only because of the 'autofill' function. By changing a number at the last row (bottom)\nof entries, and autofilling upward to the top, the effect of any change can be immediately assessed at the\ninstant the graph is refreshed on the monitor. The process slows down with larger data sets, but some of\nthe present cases involved 32K voltage values; which is the maximum file size for graphing in Excel.\n[Caution: autofilling downward can experience a 'sensitive dependence on initial conditions'--the\ngeneration of blank rows at a rate which approaches infinity! ]\n\nEstimating the Viscous (linear) contribution to the Damping\nIn Fig. 8 we see the dissipation history of the decay record of Fig. 7.\n\n\fFigure 8. Illustration of Fig. 7's time-dependent dissipation, due to nonlinear damping.\nThe influence of the nonlinear damping (through parameters a and c) is readily evident in Fig. 8. In the\nearly part of the decay, loss is greater than exponential (due to non-zero a), causing the Q to increase from\nbelow 40 toward the maximum of about 120. If there were no Coulomb damping (bearings that support the\npendulum), the Q would limit at the value of 136 (obtained by setting c = 0 in the spreadsheet algorithm).\nThe method just described is the only dependable means known to the author for estimating the\nexponential (constant Q) contribution to the damping. As was noted earlier, attempts to 'fit to the tail' of\nthe decay are fraught with subtle difficulties of non-reproducibility, even if there were not an obvious and\nultimate Coulomb fall-off, as in the present case.\nIt should be noted that the limiting Q (136) is not necessarily viscous-only damping, since\nhysteretic damping also gives an exponential (constant Q) decay. To compare present results with Eq. 16,\nrequires a correction to the raw data, due to its internal friction (hysteretic) component. The hysteretic\ncomponent had been determined earlier; i.e., Q hys = 3940 f 2 (refer to Fig. 4). Thus,\n\n1\nQv , exp\n\n=\n\n1\nQmeas\n\n\u2212\n\n1\nQhys\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nUsing Eq. 17, we thus adjust the measured Q upward to yield our estimate for the viscous Q at the\nfrequency of 0.516 Hz ; i.e., 156. From Eq. 16, for the moment of inertia appropriate to 0.516 Hz ( I = .099\nkg m2 ), we obtain a value that is 13 % larger, at 176. This is evidently a systematic error of unknown\norigin (using for the viscosity of water 1.0016 mPa s and for the density 1000.0 kg/m3) , since most of the\n15 measurement results are smaller by roughly this amount.\nShown in Fig. 9 are the comparions with theory for all 15 cases. Here, rather than correcting the\nmeasurements upward to compare with theory, we have instead elected, in Fig. 9, to correct Eq. 16\ndownward to compare directly to the experimental values.\n\n\fFigure 9. Comparison of theory against experiment. The solid curves of theory were generated by\ncombining with Eq. 16 the Hysteretic influence detailed in the data of Fig. 4.\nIn generating the experimental data of Fig. 9, only the exponential (limiting) Q's were considered.\nFollowing nonlinear curve fits to each of the decay records, this limit was obtained by setting parameters\nand c of the fit to zero (in Eq. 15 ). The limit corresponds to a combination of low-level (linear) viscous\ndamping and hysteretic (internal friction) damping. The latter is more important in the low-frequency\nbranch of Fig. 9.\nTo ignore the hysteretic damping in the lower branch of Fig. 9 is to overestimate the Q\nsubstantially, as seen in Fig. 10.\n\n\fFigure 10. Illustration of large errors that result from ignoring hysteretic damping of the pendulum at\nlower frequencies (red curves).\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe present work, plus the independent investigation of others, provides strong evidence for a\nbroadly important form of internal friction damping that has been ignored for decades following the earliest\nscientific evidence for its existence. Failure for its recognition probably derives from the fact that its most\ncommon embodiment is cause for exponential decay, just like linear viscous damping. Yet in the\ncelebrated work of George Gabriel Stokes, written in the mid-nineteenth century, there are tell-tale\nindicators of its presence. Most important is the little-known 1927 paper which made claims for this\nuniversal form of damping in solids, that is not consistent with the physics of fluid friction. In spite of\nthese strong early indicators, only since the 1990's has this universal form of damping been seriously\nstudied.\nThe methods of pedagogical physics appear to have been a factor in our oversight. From their\ntextbooks, students are led to believe that external-to-the-oscillator (viscous) friction is the most important\n(if not only) mechanism responsible for energy loss of an oscillator. To make matters worse, the textbook\ntreatment of damping is not even adequate to the treatment of harmonic fluid friction. There is undue\nattention to what may be a non-measurable attribute of the theory provided; and students can be easily led\nto believe that the viscous damping coefficient is a constant, involving only the viscosity of the fluid.\nAlthough many cases of damping can be adequately described by a coefficient multiplying the velocity, it\nis not permissible to treat this coefficient as being independent of either (i) the frequency, or (ii) the density\nof the fluid in which the oscillation occurs.\nDeterministic chaos took on meaning, only after our obsession with linear elasticity was\nabandoned; so likewise, it is felt that additional important discoveries await the elimination of our\nobsession with linear damping.\nREFERENCES\n(1) A.
