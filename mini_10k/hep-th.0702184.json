One of them is the dynamical nature of dark energy, often parameterized by its equation of state p = w\u03c1. This\nshall be refered to as the inverse cosmological constant problem, in the sense that there\nare data to be explained by a theoretical construct. A pure cosmological constant corresponds to w = \u22121. This aspect is mainly cosmological, and progress on it can hopefully be\nmade by refining the observational data, which nowadays seem to strongly favor \u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.7\ncorresponding to a mass scale\nMDE \u223c 10\u221212 GeV\n\n(1)\n\nand w \u223c \u22121 [13].\nEven if a dynamical component such as quintessence is discovered that explains fully\nthe acceleration of the Universe, other problems remain. For example, it would still not be\nunderstood why the vacuum energy due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in quantum\nfield theory does not produce a much larger cosmological constant. This shall be designated\nas the direct cosmological constant problem, in the sense that it refers to an unfulfilled\ntheoretical prediction.\nA drastic possibility is that the way spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in quantum\nphysics is not understood at all. It has been suggested, in particular by R.L. Jaffe [10], that\neven the experimental confirmation of the Casimir energy [11] should not be considered as\na proof of the existence of (zero point) vacuum energy in quantum field theory. This seems\nto be an extreme viewpoint. A clear experimental signal of vacuum energy as well of the\nstrength of its gravitational coupling would be most welcome.\nAs a matter of fact, even allegedly uncontroversial breakings contribute to the problem.\nFor instance, chiral symmetry breaking due to the quark condensate yields a contribution\nof the order of \u039bQCD , which is eleven orders of magnitude\n1\n\n1\n\nabove the purported range of\n\nThose figures get multiplied by a factor four if the energy density is the quantity to be compared.\n\n2\n\n\fobserved values for the cosmological constant.\nTurning again to the general aspects of the direct problem, the status is as follows.\nIn order to not strongly disagree with observations, there are essentially two possibilities:\neither there is a cancellation in such a way that the low energy vacuum energy is very\nsmall (in natural units) or else there is a modification of gravity such that vacuum energy\ndoes not gravitate (or gravitates less than ordinary matter). This viewpoint has been\nadvocated, for example, in [3], but the theories proposed there are badly non-local. Still\n(as has also been hinted at by those authors) there is an intriguing relationship between\ntheir approach and unimodular theories in general which has not been fully elucidated yet.\nThe purpose of the present work is to explore in some detail a setting in which the\nrelative weight of the vacuum energy with respect to the kinetic energy can be tuned at\nwill, and indeed in an extreme case the vacuum energy does not weigh at all. This will be\ndone in a local theory that is a minor modification of General Relativity (GR), in the sense\nthat the gauge group is not the full set of general coordinate transformations (GC) (which\nwill be interpreted in the active sense as diffeomorphisns spanning the group Diff(M)), but\nrather those that enjoy unit jacobian. These particular transformations have been called\nunimodular transformations, and in a preceding paper the name transverse diffeomorphisms\n(TDiffs) spanning a subgroup TDiff(M) has been used. Please refer to [1] where other\nrelevant references can also be found. To be specific, transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiffs)\nin a spacetime manifold whose points are described in a particular coordinate chart by\nx\u03bc (P ), \u03bc = 0, 1, . . . , n \u2212 1 are those diffeomorphisms\nx\u03bc \u2192 y \u03bc\nsuch that the determinant of the jacobian matrix equals unity:\n\u0012 \u03bc\u0013\n\u2202y\n=1\nD(y, x) \u2261 det\n\u2202x\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nIn the linearized approximation, the Diff is expressed through a vector field;\ny \u03bc = x\u03bc + \u03be \u03bc (x)\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fand the above mentioned condition is equivalent to\n\u2202\u03b1 \u03be \u03b1 = 0\n\n(5)\n\nThis is the reason of the qualifier transverse applied to them. Usually tensor densities of\nweight w are defined in such a way that they get an extra factor of the jacobian to the\npower w in the tensorial transformation law. For example, a scalar density transforms as\na one-dimensional representation of Diff(M), namely:\n\u03c6\u2032w (y) = (D(y, x))w \u03c6(x)\n\n(6)\n\nWhenever there is a metric (in the usual sense, a rank two tensor and not a tensor density),\nthe determinant g \u2261 det g\u03bc\u03bd behaves as a scalar density of weight w = \u22122.\nThis means that as long as we assume that TDiff is the basic symmetry of Nature, we\ndo not distinguish tensor densities among themselves. In particular, given a certain scalar\nfield, \u03c6(x), all dressed fields f (g)\u03c6(x) also behave as scalars under TDiff.\nVector fields inducing TDiffs can then be represented as\n\u03be \u03b1 = \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc2 ...\u03bcn \u2202\u03bc2 \u03a9\u03bc3 ...\u03bcn = \u01eb\u03b1\u03bc2 ...\u03bcn \u2207\u03bc2 \u03a9\u03bc3 ...\u03bcn\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03bc1 \u03bc2 ...\u03bcn is the contravariant Levi-Civita tensor, and \u03a9\u03bc3 ...\u03bcn is completely antisymmetric i.e., they are the components of a (n \u2212 3)-form.\n\n2\n\nSome simple models\n\nWe shall study a particular class of theories which enjoy TDiff (as opposed to full Diff)\ninvariance. As explained before, we can dress the gravitational and the matter sectors with\ndifferent functions of the determinant of the metric, namely:\nS\u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n(wi )\nd x \u2212 2 f (g)R + fm (g)Lm (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6i , g)\n2\u03ba\nn\n\n4\n\n(8)\n\n\fIn this formula, \u03ba2 \u2261 8\u03c0Gn , Gn being the n-dimensional Newton's constant. \u03c6i (i = 1 . . . N)\nrepresent matter fields, which enjoy arbitrary weights wi on top of their own transformation\nproperties under the group Diff(M). The determinant of the metric, g, is counted as a\nmatter field with w = \u22122 for those purposes.\nThe simplest instance posits Lm as a full scalar, which will be assumed by simplicity\nnot to depend on derivatives of the metric (so that all matter fields are minimally coupled).\nMore general terms involving \u2202\u03bc g are not included for the time being since they introduce\nadditional unnecessary complications. That is, the Lagrangian to be considered in the\npresent paper is:\nS\u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nd x \u2212 2 f (g)R + fm (g)Lm (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6i )\n2\u03ba\nn\n\n(9)\n\n(with all weights wi = 0).\nIt should be remarked from the start than this action principle is non fully covariant;\nif it is assumed valid in a certain reference systen (RS), in general coordinates reads:\nS=\n\nZ\n\n1\nd x\nC(x)\nn\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u2212 2 f (g(x)C(x)2 )R(x) + fm (g(x)C(x)2 )Lm (g\u03bc\u03bd (x), \u03c6i (x))\n2\u03ba\n\n\u0013\n\n(10)\n\nwhere C(x) \u2261 D(x, x\u0304) is the determinant of the jacobian matrix with respect to some\nprivileged original coordinates denoted here by x\u0304. The field C(x) can also be viewed as\nthe determinant of the four vector fields A\u03bc(\u1fb1) , constructed from the derivatives of the\ncoordinate functions with respect to the fiducial functions x\u0304\u03bc (x). As long as the field C(x)\nis kept in the lagragian, formal Diff invariance is ensured by the chain property\nC(y) \u2261 det\n\n\u2202y\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n= det det\n= D(y, x)C(x)\n\u2202 x\u0304\n\u2202x\n\u2202 x\u0304\n\n(11)\n\ni.e., the composite field\ng(x)C(x)2\n\n(12)\n\nis a gauge invariant construct under the gauge group Diff(M). This type of field is sometimes\n[9] called a compensator field. A notorious exaple is the Stueckelberg field which renders\n\n5\n\n\fgauge invariant massive electrodynamics. The original theory can always be recovered in\nthe analogous of the unitary gauge\nC(x) = 1\n\n2.1\n\n(13)\n\nThe source of gravity\n\nThere are several energy momentum tensors of interest in this case. Actually, they are\nin general not true tensors under GC; only densities. The true energy-momentum tensor\n(that is, the source of the gravitational equations), is\nZ\n\u03b4\n\u03b4Sm\ndn xfm Lm\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03bc\u03bd \u2261 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b4g\n\u03b4g\n\n(14)\n\nIn order to study its conservation law, let us perform a TDiff (cf.

This last solution implies fm \u223c\n\n(50)\np\n|g|,\n\nas one should expect because it corresponds to Diff invariance and the compensator is just\n\nlooking for it. If we do not want to impose Diff invariance from the very beginning, we are\nforced to impose the constraint\nLm = 0\n\n(51)\n\nThe meaning of this is that in this sector, the TDiff energy-momentum tensor is a consistent\nsource of Einstein's equations: the constraint ensures the integrability condition (48) to\nhold, although it is somewhat stricter than necessary (see (29)). In any case, from this\nmore elegant point of view, conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in the sense of\n(48) is just a consequence of compensator dynamics.\nSimilar results are obtained when the model is generalized by allowing matter fields\n\u03c6(w) to become scalar densities of weight w and considering Diff invariant Lagrangians\nSm =\n\nZ\n\ndn x\n\n\u0001\n1\nfm g(x)C(x)2 Lm (\u03c6(w) C(x)\u2212w )\nC(x)\n\n(52)\n\nThe EM for the compensator now takes the form\n1\n1 \u2202fm\n1\n\u03b4Lm\n\u03b4Sm\n= \u2212 2 fm Lm +\nLm +\nfm\n=0\n\u03b4C(x)\nC\nC \u2202C\nC\n\u03b4C\n\n(53)\n\nBut given the functional dependence of Lm on the combination \u03c6(w) C(x)\u2212w it is easy to\nconvince oneself that\n\u03b4Lm\n\u03b4Lm\n\u221d (w)\n\u03b4C\n\u03b4\u03c6\n\n(54)\n\nTherefore, (50) is recovered under the assumption that the scalar field verifies its EM.\n\n12\n\n\f4\n\nTDiff Friedmann models\n\n4.1\n\nWeight one\n\nLet us study in detail the extreme case in which the matter Lagrangian does not couple to\nthe determinant of the metric. This means fm = 1 in our previous notation.\nLat us stress that we do not expect these models to be realistic. In practice fm \u223c fg .\nOur aim in this paragraph is a sort of existence proof; i.e., to show that it is possible to\nbuild theoretically consistent models in the unimodular framework in which the potential\nenergy does not weigh at all, and consequently, models that solve the direct cosmological\nconstant problem.\nThe simplest example is again a minimally coupled scalar field:\n1\nLm = g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\n2\n\n(55)\n\nwhere V (\u03c6) is a polynomial representing the potential energy, and which does not contribute to the gravitational EM (this is the main motivation for assuming fm = 1). This\npoint is so important that it is worth emphasizing: not all energy is a source of the gravitational field in TDiff theories, but only the kinetic part of it.\nThe preceding paragraph would be exactly true were it not for the compensators.\nActually, all energy interacts with the gravitational field through compensator exchange.\nThis point shall be hopefully clarified in the sequel.\nIn the final section of this paper we will introduce a framework which allows in principle\nan experimental test of this hypothesis and, in general, of the strength of the coupling of\nthe potential energy to the gravitational field.\nThe energy-momentum tensor reads:\n1\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202\u03bd \u03c6\n2\n\n(56)\n\nThis means that it is not only the constant piece, but rather the full potential energy\n13\n\n\fdensity that does not generate gravitational field. The matter EM are:\n\u2202\u03bc (g \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03c6) + V \u2032 (\u03c6) = 0\n\n(57)\n\nPlus the EM for the compensator, which is again\nLm = 0\n\n(58)\n\nThis equation is the one that feeds back the potential energy into the gravitational equations, although in a very unusual way.\n\n4.2\n\nFriedmann\n\nIn order to get an idea of the simplest cosmological consequences of the TDiff viewpoint,\nit would be convenient to assume a (spatially) flat Friedmann metric:\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 R(t)2 \u03b4ij dxi dxj \u2261 dt2 \u2212 R(t)2 dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2\n\n\u0001\n\n(59)\n\nThis particular form of the metric is written however in the so called synchronous gauge\ng00 = 1\ng0i = 0\n\n(60)\n\n(defining what is known as Robertson-Walker5 coordinates) which is not accessible in\ngeneral using TDiffs only, since we have now less gauge freedom than in General Relativity\nbecause of the transversality condition, or equivalently we have already partially fixed the\ngauge by choosing C(x) = 1.\nThe simplest form of a metric that can be reached with TDiff is\nds2 = a(t)dt2 \u2212 R(t)2 \u03b4ij dxi dxj \u2261 a(t)dt2 \u2212 R(t)2 dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2\n5\n\n\u0001\n\n(61)\n\nThe use of a specific set of Robertson-Walker coordinates is not as innocent as it seems, and physics\n\ndoes depend on this choice to a certain extent in the present framework.\n\n14\n\n\fThe corresponding Einstein tensor is\n\u1e582\n\u2261 3H(t)2\nR2\n\u0227\u1e58R \u2212 2aR\u0308R \u2212 a\u1e582\n=\n\u03b4ij\na2\n\nG00 = 3\nGij\n\n(62)\n\nSo the spacelike sector of Einstein's equations then imply that\n\u2202i \u03c6 = 0\n\n(63)\n\nand the gravitational equations take the simple form (using the compensator EM)\n\u03ba2\n2a1/2 \u03ba2\n2\n\u03c6\u0307\n=\nV (\u03c6)\na1/2 R3\nR3\n3aH 2 + 2a\u1e22 \u2212 \u0227H = 0\n3H 2 =\n\n(64)\n\nSince we have now an additional constraint imposed by the EM of the compensator, or\nin other language by the conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, it is interesting to\ncheck the compatibility of the whole system of equations. The usual counting of degrees of\nfreedom in GR is as follows. In four dimensions the metric has 10 independent components,\n4 of which can be gauge fixed. Then one has 6 variables for 10 Einstein's equations, but\nagain using the Bianchi identities it is certain that four of them are combination of the\nothers, so finally one is left with 6 equations for 6 variables.\nWhen we consider a TDiff model such as the one above, the freedom to fix the gauge is\nsmaller so that we have to determine 7 components of the metric. The Bianchi identities are\nnevertheless satisfied and then there are 6 Einstein's equations. The consistency is saved\nfinally by the EM of the compensator that provides the 7th equation for the 7 variables. Let\nus prove this assertion in the particular model considered, i.e., the scalar Lagrangian (55)\nwith the metric (61). Conservation of the energy-momentum tensor forces the Lagrangian\nto be a constant, so differentiating (55) with respect to time\n!\n1 d \u03c6\u03072\n\u2212 V \u2032 (\u03c6)\u03c6\u0307 = 0\n2 dt a\n15\n\n(65)\n\n\fUsing the EM of the scalar to eliminate the potential, after some straightforward algebra\nwe get the condition (supposing \u03c6\u0307 6= 0)\n\u03c6\u0308\n3 \u0227\n=\n4a\n\u03c6\u0307\n\n(66)\n\nOn the other hand, the first of the Einstein's equations in (64) implies\n\u03c6\u0308\n\u1e22 3 \u1e58 1 \u0227\n+\n+\n=\nH 2R 4a\n\u03c6\u0307\n\n(67)\n\nFinally, equating these last two expressions allows us to derive the second Einstein's equation in (64). We conclude that the system of equations must be compatible and the three\nfunctions (\u03c6(t), a(t), R(t)) can be determined. This same consistency is not found if we\nchoose a(t) \u2261 1 from the beginning6 , except in the particular case in which the potential\nis a constant, and this will be related with the impossibility to get exponential expansion,\nas we will see.\nIt is easy to find the explicit solution in the absence of potential. If the matter Lagrangian is fixed to be a constant Lm = L (the freedom to fix the constant is lost when the\nEM for the compensator is used so that L = 0), then the component of the metric a = a0\nis also constant and the scale factor goes as\nH0\nH(t) =\n1 + 23 H0 t\nwhere R03 =\n\n\u0013 32\n\u0012\n3\nR(t) = R0 1 + H0 t\n2\n\n=\u21d2\n\n(68)\n\n1/2\n\n2a0 \u03ba2 L\n.\n3H02\n\nThe time evolution of the scalar is linear and given by\n\u03c6(t) = \u03c60 \u00b1\n\np\n2La0 t\n\n(69)\n\nOnce we choose to impose the constraint L = 0 the only solution if the potential vanishes\nis a constant field with null Hubble constant, but a remains undetermined.\n6\n\nThe inconsistency is between conservation of the energy-momentum tensor, or compensator's EM, and\n\nthe scalar EM.\n\n16\n\n\f4.3\n\nThe GR template\n\nThese equations ought to be contrasted with the standard GR ones, where the synchronous\ngauge a = 1 is fully accessible.

Namely, they enjoy symmetry\nunder unimodular transformations , that is, diffeomorphisms with unit determinant of the\njacobian matrix. They generate a group, that is called TDiff(M).\nIn some simplified TDiff cosmological models it has been found that exponential expanding solutions are inconsistent. This seems to alleviate the direct problem of the cosmological constant.\nThe main reason however why those solutions are physically interesting is that they\nallow to tune, in a precise sense, the relative weight of the kinetic and potential energy.\nThere are models in particular, in which the potential energy (and a fortiori the vacuum\nenergy) does not couple to the gravitational field, so that it appears that it does not\nweight at all.7 This provides a framework to test the gravity/potential energy coupling,\nwhich violates the equivalence principle inasmuch as it is different from the gravity/ kinetic\nenergy coupling (cf. Damour's contribution in [6]). Experiments are difficult but perhaps\nnot impossible (weighing the Casimir energy?).\nThe vacuum gravitational equations for the TDiff models studied in this paper are\nexactly the same as the GR ones, so that all solar systems tests are also fulfilled. There\n7\n\nModulo some subtleties discussed in the main text, namely compensator exchange.\n\n20\n\n\fmight be some subtle points with the derivation of the binary pulsar tests [14] worth a\ndetailed study.\nLet us finally discuss if this framework could alter the results of an E\u00f6tv\u00f6s type experiment. If a WKB expansion is performed [2] in the EM for the scalar field\ni\n\n\u03c6 = e\u01eb\n\nP\n\n\u01eb n \u03c6n\n\n(90)\n\nthen, to dominant order (1/\u01eb2 ), and defining k\u03bc \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u03c60 , the mass shell condition\nk 2 = m2\n\n(91)\n\nis recovered, as well as the geodesic equation in the form\nk \u03b1 \u2207\u03b1 k \u03b2 = 0\n\n(92)\n\nAll this is quite similar to the GR template. The subtle differences in the coupling to the\ngravitational field in the scalar EM do not appear to this order in the WKB expansion.\nThe physical meaning of this result is that unimodular cosmology predicts exactly the\nsame results as GR for free falling of test bodies (to which refer current experiments on\nthe equivalence principle).\nNevertheless, it has been claimed in [4] that the huge body of data on the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment for different substances puts constraints (barring accidental cancellations) on the\npossible violations of the equivalence principle on the potential energy (less than 10\u221210 ) and\nthe kinetic energy separately (less than 10\u22127 ). This then puts corresponding constraints\non the ratio\n\nfm\n.\nfg\n\nHypothetical positive results could be interpreted in the framework of our\n\nformalism.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are indebted to Diego Blas, Jaume Garriga, Bel\u00e9n Gavela Eduard Mass\u00f3 and Enric\nVerdaguer for illuminating discussions.
