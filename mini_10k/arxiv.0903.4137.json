Stewart\n\nAbstract. Let G := G2 (K) be a simple algebraic group of type G2 defined over\nan algebraically closed field K of characteristic p > 0. Let \u03c3 denote a standard\nFrobenius automorphism of G such that G\u03c3 \u223c\n= G2 (q) with q \u2265 4. In this paper we\nfind all reductive subgroups of G and quasi-simple subgroups of G\u03c3 in the defining\ncharacteristic. Our results extend the complete reducibility results of [13, Thm 1].\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecall that G2 has maximal rank subgroups of type A1 \u00c31 and A2 (also \u00c32\ngenerated by all short root groups of G when p = 3). When p = 2 we define\nZ1 to be the subgroup of type A1 obtained from the embedding\nA1 (K) \u2192 A1 (K) \u25e6 A1 (K) \u2264 G;\n\nx 7\u2192 (x, x).\n\nAlso when p = 2, we define Z2 to be the subgroup of type A1 obtained from\nthe embedding\nA1 (K) \u2192 A2 (K) \u2264 G\nwhere A1 \u223c\n= P SL2 (K) embeds in A2 by its action on the three-dimensional\nspace Sym2 V for V the standard module for SL2 (K). It is shown later\nthat these subgroups are contained in the long root parabolic of G, that is,\nP = hB, x\u2212r (t) : t \u2208 Ki where r is the long simple root associated with the\nchoice of Borel subgroup B.\nLet L\u0304, (resp. L\u0303) denote the standard Levi subgroup of the standard long root\n(resp. short root) parabolic subgroup of G containing the Borel subgroup\nB. Let L\u03040 (resp L\u03030 ) denote the subgroup of L\u0304 (resp L\u0303) generated by the\nunipotent elements. Observe that L\u03040 \u223c\n= A1 .\n= L\u03030 \u223c\n1\n\n\fThe main theorem is:\nTheorem 1. Let X \u223c\n= A1 (K) be a subgroup of a parabolic subgroup in G =\nG2 (K).\nIf p > 2 then X is conjugate to precisely one of L\u03040 and L\u03030 .\nIf p = 2 then X is conjugate to precisely one of L\u03040 , L\u03030 , Z1 and Z2 .\nRecall Serre's notion of G-complete reducibility [17]. A subgroup is said to\nbe G-completely reducible or G-cr if, whenever it is a subgroup of a parabolic\nsubgroup of G, it is contained in a Levi subgroup of that parabolic subgroup.\nCorollary 2. All connected reductive subgroups of G are G-cr unless p = 2,\nin which case there are precisely two classes of non G-cr subgroups.\nThis extends the result [13, Thm 1] which states that all subgroups of G are\nG-cr provided p > 3.\nCorollary 3. Let X denote a closed, connected semisimple subgroup of G.\nThen up to conjugacy, (X, p, V7 \u2193 X) is precisely one entry in the following\ntable where V7 \u2193 X denotes the restriction of the seven-dimensional Weyl\nmodule WG (\u03bb1 ) to X.\nX\np\nV7 \u2193 X\nA2\nany\n10 \u2295 01 \u2295 0\n\u00c32\np=3\n11\nA1 \u00c31\nany\n1 \u2297 1\u0303 \u2295 0 \u2297 W\u0303 (2)\nL\u03040\nany\n1 \u2295 1 \u2295 03\nL\u03030\nany\n1 \u2295 1 \u2295 W (2)\nZ1\np=2\nT (2) \u2295 W (2)\nZ2\np=2\nW (2) \u2295 W (2)\u2217 \u2295 0\ns\ns\n(pr )\n(ps )\n(pr )\nA1 \u0592\u2192 A1 \u00c31 ; x 7\u2192 (x , x ) r 6= s any (1\n\u2297 1(p ) ) \u2295 W (2)(p )\nA1 \u0592\u2192 A2 , irred\np>2\n2\u22952\u22950\nA1 , max\np\u22657\n6\nThe subgroup denoted \u00c32 exists only when p = 3 and is generated by the\nshort root subgroups of G. (The above table appears not to contain the\n2\n\n\firreducible A1 \u2264 \u00c32 . It is shown later that this subgroup is conjugate to the\nsubgroup A1 \u0592\u2192 A1 \u00c31 where r = 1, s = 0.)\nSome remarks on notation. In the above table and elsewhere we refer to an\nirreducible module by its high weight \u03bb. When X is of type A1 , \u03bb is given as\nan integer; by a module ab for a group of type A2 we mean the irreducible\nmodule with high weight a\u03bb1 + b\u03bb2 where \u03bbi is the fundamental dominant\nr\nweight corresponding to the simple root \u03b1i . By V (p ) we mean the Frobenius\nr\ntwist of the module V induced by the Frobenius morphism x 7\u2192 x(p ) . The\nnotation \u03bc1 |\u03bc2 | . . . |\u03bcn indicates a module with the same composition factors\nas the module \u03bc1 \u2295 \u03bc2 \u2295 * * * \u2295 \u03bcn . The notation \u03bc1 /\u03bc2 / . . . /\u03bcn indicates an\nindecomposable module with composition factors of high weights \u03bci for some\ndominant weights \u03bci and is given in the order in which the factors occur so\nthat there is a submodule \u03bci / . . . /\u03bcn and a quotient \u03bc1 / . . . /\u03bci\u22121 . By W (2)\nwe denote the Weyl module for A1 of high weight 2; when p > 2 this is\nirreducible and when p = 2 it is indecomposable of type 1(2) /0. Lastly when\np = 2 we denote by T (2) the four-dimensional tilting module for A1 which is\nindecomposable of type 0/1(2) /0.\nNow let \u03c3 denote a standard Frobenius automorphism of G such that G\u03c3 =\nG2 (q) with q \u2265 4. We use the proof of Theorem 1 and its corollaries to\nprove a result about the quasi-simple subgroups of Lie type of G\u03c3 in the\ndefining characteristic. (A quasi-simple group of Lie type is a perfect central\nextension of a simple group of Lie type.)\nTheorem 2. Let X(q0 ) \u2264 G\u03c3 where X(q0 ) is a quasi-simple group of Lie\ntype over Fq0 , a field of the same characteristic as Fq . Then there exists a \u03c3stable simple algebraic subgroup X\u0304 of G of the same type as X(q0 ) containing\nX(q0 ).\nRemark 1.1. Using [16, 5.1], it follows that X(q0 ) is unique up to conjugacy\nin X\u0304\u03c3 . Since Corollary 3 determines X\u0304, it follows that we have found, up\nto G\u03c3 -conjugacy, all quasi-simple subgroups of Lie type of G\u03c3 with the same\ndefining characteristic as G.\nRemark 1.2. The only non-simple semisimple subgroups of G\u03c3 are of the\nform SL2 (q1 ) \u25e6 SL2 (q2 ) with q1 , q2 \u2265 4, since any such group must have rank\n2. Since we have found all the quasi-simple groups using the above theorem,\nwe have also found all semisimple subgroups of Lie type of G\u03c3 in the defining\ncharacteristic. (A semisimple subgroup of Lie type, H is a subgroup such\n3\n\n\fthat H \u2032 = H and H/Z(H) is a direct product of simple subgroups of Lie\ntype.)\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nLet X \u223c\n= A1 (K) with |K| \u2265 4 finite or K algebraically closed of characteristic p > 0. Let V := VX (\u03bb) denote an irreducible rational KX-module\nof high weight \u03bb. To prove Theorem 1 we require some information about\nH 1 (X, V ), the first cohomology group of X with coefficients in V . We recall\nthat H 1 (X, V ) is a K-vector space and is in bijection with the V -conjugacy\nclasses of closed complements to V in the semidirect product XV . Recall\nalso the standard fact that H 1 (X, V ) \u223c\n= Ext1X (K, V ) (see [9, p50]).\nLemma 2.1. Ext1X (K, VX (\u03bb)) is non-zero if and only if \u03bb is a Frobenius\ntwist of the module (p \u2212 2) \u2297 1(p) . When it is non-zero it is one-dimensional\nunless |K| = 9 and VX (\u03bb) = 1 \u2297 1(3) where it is two-dimensional.\nProof. This follows from setting \u03bc = 0 in [2, 4.5] with the small correction\ngiven in [15, 1.2].\nRecall that a parabolic subgroup P has a decomposition as a semidirect\nproduct LQ of a Levi subgroup L with unipotent radical Q. We employ the\nabove result to investigate complements to Q in P . The next result shows\nhow Q admits a filtration by KL-modules. We recall the notions of height,\nshape and level of a root from [1]. Take a root system \u03a6 for G(K) with fixed\nbase of simple roots \u03a0. Let J \u2282 \u03a0 be a subset of the simple roots and define\nthe parabolic subgroup PJ by PJ = hB, x\u2212\u03b1 (t) : \u03b1 \u2208 Ji. LetP\n\u03a6J = ZJ \u2229 \u03a6.\nFix a P\nroot \u03b2 \u2208 \u03a6+ \u2212 \u03a6J . We write \u03b2 = \u03b2J + \u03b2J\u2032 where \u03b2J = \u03b1i \u2208J ci \u03b1i and\n\u03b2J\u2032 = \u03b1i \u2208\u03a0\u2212J di \u03b1i . Define\nX\nX\nheight(\u03b2) =\nci +\ndi\nshape(\u03b2) = \u03b2J\u2032\nX\nlevel(\u03b2) =\ndi .\n\nNow define Q(i) := hx\u03b2 (t) : t \u2208 K, level(\u03b2) \u2265 ii and define VS = hx\u03b2 (t) : t \u2208\nK, shape(\u03b2) = Si.\n4\n\n\fLemma 2.2. Let G(K) be a split Chevalley group. For each i \u2265 1, Q(i)/Q(i+\n1)\nQ has the structure of a KL-module with decomposition Q(i)/Q(i + 1) =\nVS , the product over all shapes S of level i. Furthermore, each VS is a\nKL-module with highest weight \u03b2 where \u03b2 is the unique root of maximal\nheight and shape S.\nProof. This is the main result of [1], noting the Remark 1 at the end of the\npaper which gives the result even in the case G(K) is special.\nThroughout the paper we will need the restrictions V7 \u2193 X of the sevendimensional Weyl module V7 := WG2 (\u03bb1 ) to various subgroups X of G =\nG2 (K). We calculate these now.\nLemma 2.3. The entries in the table following Corollary 3 have the restrictions V7 \u2193 X as stated.\nProof. The restriction V7 \u2193 X for the maximal A1 when p \u2265 7 is well known\nand is listed in [19, Main Theorem].\nConsider G2 embedded in D4 as the fixed points of the triality automorphism.\nWe consider the restriction of the natural 8-dimensional module V8 for D4 .\nRecall that V8 \u2193 G2 = 0/V7 . For p = 2, V7 becomes reducible and V8 \u2193 G2 =\n0/V6 /0.\nRecall that L\u03040 , L\u03030 are the simple, connected subgroups of the long and short\nLevi subgroups respectively. We first consider V7 \u2193 L\u03040 , L\u03030 and A1 \u00c31 .\n\nWe can see that A1 \u00c31 \u2264 A41 \u2264 D4 . It is clear that the A41 subsystem in D4\nis realised as A1 \u2297 A1 \u22a5 A1 \u2297 A1 \u223c\n= SO4 \u22a5 SO4. Take the long A1 to be\nthe first of the four and the short \u00c31 to be embedded diagonally in the other\nthree.\nNow it follows that we have V8 \u2193 L\u03030 = 02 \u2297 1 \u22a5 1 \u2297 1 = 1 \u2295 1 \u22a5 T (2) for\np = 2 and 1 \u2295 1 \u22a5 2 \u2295 0 for p > 2. This gives V7 \u2193 L\u03030 = 1 \u2295 1 \u22a5 W (2) for\np = 2 and V7 \u2193 L\u03030 = 1 \u2295 1 \u22a5 2 for p > 2.\nWe also have V8 \u2193 L\u03040 = 1 \u2297 02 \u22a5 02 \u2297 02 = 1 \u2295 1 \u22a5 04 . Hence V7 \u2193 L0 =\n1 \u2295 1 \u22a5 03 . It follows also that V7 \u2193 A1 \u00c31 = 1 \u2297 1\u0303 \u2295 0 \u2297 W\u0303 (2).\nNext we establish V7 \u2193 A2 . As the A2 is a subsystem subgroup of G2 , it is\nin a subsystem of the D4 . It is therefore contained in an A3 . We can see\n5\n\n\feasily that \u03bb1 for D4 restricts to A3 as \u03bb1 \u2295 \u03bb3 = \u03bb1 \u2295 \u03bb\u22171 (see e.g. [4, 13.3.4]).\nSince A2 sits inside A3 such that the natural module for A3 restricts to A2\nas \u03bb1 \u2295 0 we see that V7 \u2193 A2 = \u03bb1 \u2295 \u03bb\u22171 \u2295 0.\nUsing this we can restrict to the irreducible A1 \u2264 A2 for p > 2, and to\nZ2 \u2264 A2 , when p = 2. In this case the natural module for A2 , \u03bb1 \u2193 A1 = 2\nfor p > 2 and \u03bb1 \u2193 Z2 = W (2). Hence V7 \u2193 A1 = 2 \u2295 2 \u2295 0 and V7 \u2193 Z2 =\nW (2) \u2295 W (2)\u2217 \u2295 0.\nNow we compute V7 \u2193 X for X := A1 \u0592\u2192 A1 \u00c31 twisted by pr on the first\nfactor and ps on the second. Using the decomposition above, we read off\nr\ns\ns\nV7 \u2193 X = 1(p ) \u2297 1(p ) \u2295 2(p ) . For s = r = 0 when p = 2, this gives\nV7 \u2193 Z1 = T (2) \u2295 2/0.\nLastly let X = \u00c32 (p = 3). One checks that a base of simple roots {\u03b21 , \u03b22 }\nfor G is expressed in terms of the roots of D4 as { 13 (\u03b11 + \u03b13 + \u03b14 ), \u03b12 }. On\nthese two elements, the weight \u03bb1 for D4 has \u03bb1 (\u03b21 ) = 1 and \u03bb1 (\u03b22 ) = 1\nimplying V8 \u2193 \u00c32 has composition factors 11|00 so that V7 \u2193 \u00c32 = 11.\n\n3\n\nComplements in parabolics: proof of Theorem 1\n\nLet G = G2 (K) with K algebraically closed of characteristic p and let X \u223c\n=\nA1 (K) be a subgroup of G contained in a parabolic subgroup P = LQ of G.\nThen X is a complement to Q in L0 Q, where L0 denotes the simple subgroup\nof L generated by the unipotent elements. In the cases we are considering\nL0 = L\u2032 . Recall the notation L\u03040 and L\u03030 denoting the cases where L0 is a\nlong root A1 and short root A1 respectively.\nLemma 3.1. If X is not conjugate to L0 , then p = 2 and X is contained in\nthe long root parabolic subgroup of G.\nProof. Using 2.2, for the short root parabolic one calculates that there are\ntwo levels in Q and they have the structure of KL0 modules with high weights\n0 and 3 respectively. For p > 3 they are restricted and thus irreducible. For\np = 3 they are the modules 0 and 1(3) /1; for p = 2 they are 0 and 1(2) \u2297 1.\n\n6\n\n\fFor the long parabolic one calculates that there are three levels with high\nweights 1, 0, and 1 respectively. These are restricted and irreducible for all\ncharacteristics.\nAs L\u03040 (resp. L\u03030 ) has some odd weights on the modules in Q, it is simply\nconnected and hence admits a morphism \u03c6 to X. Composing this with the\nprojection \u03c0 to the Levi factor, we have the morphism \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6 : L0 \u2192 L0 . It\nfollows that \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c6 is an isogeny. We may assume that this is the standard\nFrobenius morphism corresponding to x 7\u2192 x(q) , say. This has the effect of\ntwisting the modules found for L\u03040 or L\u03030 above. Comparing these weights with\n2.1, we see that none of the modules admitting a non-trivial H 1 is present\nunless p = 2, q is non-trivial, and X is in the long parabolic, a complement\nto Q in L\u03040 Q.\nFrom this point we assume that p = 2, X \u2264 P the long root parabolic, a\ncomplement to Q in L\u03040 Q and X is not conjugate to L\u03040 . As H 1 (X, 1(q) ) is\n1-dimensional for all q > 1 we may assume that q = 2, observing that we\ncan obtain any other complement to Q by applying a Frobenius map to an\nappropriate complement we get for q = 2.\nSome notation is necessary for the next part of the paper. Recall the notation from [4] which uses xr (t) to refer to the root element with parameter t\ncorresponding to the root r. Since we are working entirely within G, we will\nuse xi (t) for i \u2208 {\u00b11, . . . \u00b1 6}. If we write (a, b) for a\u03b11 + b\u03b12 with \u03b11 the\nshort fundamental root and \u03b12 the long fundamental root of G, then\n[x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 , x5 , x6 ] = [x(1,0) , x(0,1) , x(1,1) , x(2,1) , x(3,1) , x(3,2) ]\nUnder this notation and that of Lemma 2.2\nQ = Q(1) = hxi (t) : i \u2208 {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}i\nQ(2) = hxi (t) : i \u2208 {4, 5, 6}i\nQ(3) = hxi (t) : i \u2208 {5, 6}i.\nWe see then that Q/Q(2), Q(2)/Q(3) and Q(3) are modules for X of high\nweights 2, 0 and 2, respectively.\nLemma 3.2. Let k, l \u2208 K. The groups Xk,l generated by\nx+ (t) = x2 (t2 )x3 (kt)x6 (k 3 t + lt) and\nx\u2212 (t) = x\u22122 (t2 )x1 (kt)x5 (lt)\n7\n\n\ffor all t \u2208 K are closed complements to Q in L\u03040 Q.\nProof. We certainly have Xk,l Q = L\u03040 Q as L\u03040 Q is generated by {xi (t)} for\ni \u2208 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, \u22122}. It remains to show that Xk,l is isomorphic to A1 (K),\nand it follows that Xk,l \u2229 Q = {1} as required.\nTo show this we will check the generators and relations given in [4, 12.1.1 &\nRk. p198], leaving us to show the following three statements hold:\n(i) x\u00b1 (t1 )x\u00b1 (t2 ) = x\u00b1 (t1 + t2 ),\n(ii) h+ (t)h+ (u) = h+ (tu) and\n(iii) n+ (t)x+ (t1 )n+ (t)\u22121 = x\u2212 (\u2212t\u22122 t1 ),\nfor all t1 , t2 \u2208 K and t, u \u2208 K \u00d7 where n+ (t) = x+ (t)x\u2212 (\u2212t\u22121 )x+ (t) and\nh+ (t) = n+ (t)n+ (\u22121). We will abbreviate n\u03b1i (t) to ni (t), similarly for h\u03b1i (t).\nUsing the commutator relations for G2 given in [4, 5.2.2] we show that these\nrelations hold.\nWrite\n\n\u0014\n\ni\nt\n\n\u0015\n\n:= xi (t).\n\nFirstly, item (i) is easily checked: no positive linear combination of roots \u03b12 ,\n\u03b13 and \u03b16 is a root except for the roots themselves, so\n\u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015 \u0014\n\u0014\n6\n3\n2\n,\nand\n,\nk 3 t + lt\nkt\nt2\nall commute with each other. The same argument follows for x\u2212 (t).\nFor (ii), we first calculate n+ (t). So we must simplify\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n3\n6\n2\n5\n1\n3\n6\n\u22122\n2\nkt\nk 3 t + lt\nt2\nlt\u22121\nkt\u22121\nkt\nk 3 t + lt\nt\u22122\nt2\nWe will move all \u00b1\u03b12 root elements to the left. The result of this calculation\nis\n\u0015\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n4\n2\n\u22122\n2\n= n2 (t2 )x4 (k 2 ).\nn+ (t) =\nk2\nt2\nt\u22122\nt2\n8\n\n\fNow it is easy to write down h+ (t). Since\n\u03b14 \u00b1 \u03b12 are not roots we have\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n4\n2\n\u22122\n2\nh+ (t) =\nk\nt2\nt\u22122\nt2\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0014\n2\n2\n\u22122\n2\n=\n2\n\u22122\n2\n1\nt\nt\nt\n\nx\u00b12 (t) commute with x4 (u) as\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\u0014 \u0015\n4\n2\n\u22122\nk\n1\n1\n\u0015\u0014 \u0015\n2\n\u22122\n1\n1\n2\n1\n\n\u0015\u0014\n\n= n2 (t2 )n2 (1)\n= h2 (t2 ).\nIt is then immediate that (ii) follows, since it holds for h2 (t). Part (iii) is\nsimilar.\nNotice that X0,0 = L\u03040 and so X is not conjugate to X0,0 by our standing\nassumption. The next two lemmas are necessary to show that the groups\nXk,l exhaust all closed complements to Q in L\u03040 Q.\nLemma 3.3. The groups Xk,0Q(2) are distinct up to Q/Q(2)-conjugacy in\nXQ/Q(2) and so form a space isomorphic to H 1 (XQ(2)/Q(2), Q/Q(2)).\nProof. Xk,0 Q(2)/Q(2) is generated by root groups x+,k (t) = x2 (t2 )x3 (kt)Q(2)\nand x\u2212,k (t) = x\u22122 (t2 )x1 (kt)Q(2). Take a fixed, arbitrary element of Q/Q(2),\ng := x1 (c1 )x3 (c2 )Q(2). Conjugating x+,k (t) by g we get\nx+,k (t)g = x2 (t2 )x3 (c1 t2 + kt)Q(2)\nand accordingly for x\u2212,k (t)g . Suppose these generate Xk\u2032 ,0 Q(2)/Q(2). Then\nwe have an automorphism of Xk\u2032 ,0 Q(2)/Q(2) \u223c\n= P SL2 (K) extending the map\ng\nx+,k\u2032 (t) \u2192 x+,k (t) \u2192 x+,k (t) . This is an inner automorphism. So we must\nhave both root groups x+,k\u2032 (t) and x+,k (t)g conjugate, say\nx+,k\u2032 (t)hQ(2) = (x2 (t2 )x3 (k \u2032 t)Q(2))hQ(2) = x2 (t2 )x3 (c1 t2 + kt)Q(2) = x+,k (t)g\nfor some hQ(2) \u2208 Xk\u2032 ,0 Q(2)/Q(2). In particular they are conjugate modulo\nQ in Xk\u2032 ,0 Q/Q by hQ. Then since x+,k\u2032 (t)Q = x+,k (t)g Q = x2 (t2 )Q, hQ\nmust centralise x2 (t2 )Q in Xk\u2032 ,0 Q/Q. It follows that\nhQ = x2 (u1)Q\n9\n\n(\u2217)\n\n\ffor some u1 \u2208 K.\nNow, using the canonical form of [4, 8.4.4] any element h of Xk,0Q(2)/Q(2)\nis uniquely expressible as either\nh = x+,k\u2032 (v1 )h2 (v2 )Q(2) or\nh = x+,k\u2032 (v1 )h2 (v2 )n2 x+,k\u2032 (v3 )Q(2)\nwhere n2 is a representative of the non-identity element of the Weyl group\nof Xk\u2032 ,0 Q(2)/Q(2). In the latter case, observe that modulo Q we have h =\nx2 (u21 )h2 (u2 )n2 x2 (u23 )Q which does not centralise x2 (t2 ) as it is not of the\n(unique) form (*) \u2013 a contradiction. In the former case, observe that v2 = 1\nby (*) and so hQ(2) centralises x+,k\u2032 (t). So c1 t2 + kt = k \u2032 t for all t \u2208 K. As\nthere are at least four elements t \u2208 K this is impossible unless c1 = 0 and\nk = k\u2032.\nLastly, to see that these complements form a space isomorphic to the space\nH 1 (XQ(2)/Q(2), Q/Q(2)), observe that Xk,0Q(2) is the closed complement\ncorresponding to a rational cocycle \u03b3k , and we can define an addition \u03b3k +\n\u03b3k\u2032 = \u03b3k+k\u2032 which is evidently well-defined on equivalence classes making the\ncollection into a one-dimensional vector space as required.\nLemma 3.4. The group Xk,l is not conjugate to Xk,l\u2032 by Q(3) for l 6= l\u2032 .\nThus for a fixed k, the groups Xk,l form a space isomorphic to H 1 (X, Q(3)).\nProof. The proof is similar to that of the previous lemma.\nProposition 3.5. X is Q-conjugate to Xk,l for some k, l \u2208 K, k, l not both\n0.\nProof. Firstly, observe that XQ(2)/Q(2) must also be a complement to\nQ/Q(2) in XQ/Q(2). As Q/Q(2) is a module for X of high weight 2,\nH 1 (X, Q/Q(2)) = K and XQ/Q(2) admits a one-dimensional collection of\ncomplements to Q/Q(2). By 3.3 these are represented by Xk,0Q(2). Replace\nX by a Q-conjugate to have XQ(2) = Xk,0 Q(2).\nNow observe XQ(3)/Q(3) is a complement to Q(2)/Q(3) in Xk,0 Q(2)/Q(3).\nAs Q(2)/Q(3) is a trivial module for X, we have H 1 (X, Q(2)/Q(3)) = 0 and\nwe may replace X by a Q-conjugate to have XQ(3) = Xk,0Q(3).\n\n10\n\n\fFinally, observe that X is a complement to Q(3) in Xk,0Q(3). As Q(3) is a\nmodule for X of high weight 2, H 1 (X, Q(3)) = K and Xk,0Q(3) admits a onedimensional collection of complements to Q(3). By 3.4 these are represented\nby Xk,l . Thus we may replace X by a Q-conjugate to have X = Xk,l .\nNow, if k = l = 0 then visibly Xk,l \u2264 L\u03040 which we had earlier assumed was\nnot the case.\nLemma 3.6. The group Xk,l is P -conjugate to one of X1,0 or X0,1 .\nProof. If k 6= 0, we can conjugate the generators of Xk,l by the fixed element\nx4 (l/k) by repeated use of Chevalley's commutator formula to get that\nx4 (l/k)Xk,l x4 (l/k)\u22121 = Xk,0 .\nFor instance,\nx4 (l/k)x+ (t)x4 (l/k)\u22121 = x4 (l/k)x2 (t2 )x3 (kt)x6 (k 3 t + lt)x4 (l/k)\n= x2 (t2 )x3 (kt)x6 (lt)x6 (k 3 t + lt)\n= x2 (t2 )x3 (kt)x6 (k 3 t),\nand the analogous calculation holds for the negative root group. Similarly\nwe calculate that\nh4 (k)\u22121 Xk,0h4 (k) = X1,0 .\nIf k = 0, and l 6= 0, again a calculation on the generators shows\nh4 (c)\u22121 X0,l h4 (c) = X0,1 ,\nwhere c is any cube root of l.\nLemma 3.7. The groups X1,0 and X0,1 are conjugate to Z1 and Z2 respectively. The subgroups Z1 , Z2 and L\u03040 are pairwise non-conjugate in G.\nProof. The construction of Z2 as a subgroup of A2 acting on the symmetric\nsquare representation allows us to calculate its root groups in terms of those\nof A2 . As the A2 is a subsystem of G it is easy to write these generators in\nterms of the root groups of G. Choosing the embeddings appropriately, one\nsees that X0,1 has precisely the same generators, hence is conjugate to Z2 .\n\n11\n\n\fNext, for p = 2, the module V7 = W (\u03bb1 ) for G is reducible and has a\ntrivial submodule, so V7 = V6 /0 with G \u2264 Sp(V6 ). From the restriction\nV6 \u2193 Z1 = W (2) \u2295 W (2)\u2217 in 2.3 we see that Z1 stabilises a 1-space of V6 .\nSince the stabliser of a 1-space is parabolic, and G acts transitively on all\nsuch by [12, Thm B], it follows that Z1 is in a parabolic subgroup of G. Since\nit has a different restriction to L\u03030 it follows that from 3.1 that it is in the\nlong parabolic of G.\nNow examine all the restrictions V7 \u2193 Z1 , Z2 and L\u03040 given by 2.3. One\nsees that they are all distinct. It follows that they are all distinct up to\nG-conjugacy. It now follows from 3.1 that X1,0 is in a long parabolic, not\nconjugate to Z2 or L\u03040 and so must be conjugate to Z1 .\nIn conclusion we have established that a complement X to Q in L\u03040 Q must\nbe conjugate to precisely one of the subgroups Z1 , Z2 or L\u03040 . Together with\n3.1, this completes the proof of Theorem 1, and Corollary 2.\n\n4\n\nClassification of semisimple subgroups of\nG2: proof of Corollary 3\n\nIn the proof of Corollary 3 we need the classification of maximal subgroups\nof the algebraic group G = G2 (K), from [14].\nLemma 4.1. Let M be a maximal closed connected subgroup of G. Then M\nis one of the following:\n(i) a maximal parabolic subgroup;\n(ii) a subsystem subgroup of maximal rank;\n(iii) A1 with p \u2265 7.\nProof of Corollary 3:\nFirstly, a semisimple subgroup in a parabolic of G2 must be of type A1 and\nwe have determined these by Theorem 1. Secondly, the subsystem subgroups\nof G2 are well known and can be determined using the algorithm of Borel-de\n12\n\n\fSiebenthal. They are A2 , A1 \u00c31 and \u00c32 (p = 3) where the \u00c32 is generated by\nthe short roots of G2 .\nSubgroups of maximal rank are unique up to conjugacy so to verify Corollary\n3 it remains to check that we have listed all subgroups of type A1 in subsystem\nsubgroups in the table. If X \u223c\n= A1 is a subgroup of A2 or \u00c32 it must be\nirreducible or else it is in a parabolic; we have listed these in the table in\nCorollary 3. If X \u2264 A1 \u00c31 , let the projection to the first (resp. second) factor\nr\ns\nbe an isogeny induced by a Frobenius morphism x \u2192 x(p ) (resp. x \u2192 x(p ) ).\nWe note some identifications amongst these subgroups:\nWhen p 6= 2 and r = s (without loss of generality r = s = 0), V7 \u2193 X =\n2 \u2295 2 \u2295 0 which is the same as V7 \u2193 Y where Y := A1 \u0592\u2192 A2 where Y acts\nirreducibly on the natural module for A2 . Indeed these are conjugate since\nG acts transitively on non-singular 1-spaces (see [12, Thm B]). When p = 2\nwe get the subgroup Z1 . When r = s + 1 and p = 3, we have V7 \u2193 X is a\ntwist of V7 \u2193 Y where Y is similarly irreducible in \u00c32 , and we have actually\nX conjugate to Y up to twists: the long word in the Weyl group w0 induces\na graph automorphism on \u00c32 and it is easy to see that we can arrange the\nembedding Y \u2264 \u00c32 such that Y \u2264 CG (w0 ). Now CG (w0 ) = A1 \u00c31 as there is\nonly one class of involutions in G when p 6= 2 by [7, p288]. The restriction\nV7 \u2193 X, Y then gives the identification required.\nFinally one can see that all other subgroups listed in the table of Corollary\n3 are pairwise non-conjugate as the restrictions of V7 in the table are all\ndistinct.\nThis proves Corollary 3.\n\n5\n\nQuasi-simple subgroups of G\u03c3 = G2(q): proof\nof Theorem 2\n\nLet X(q0 ) be a finite quasi-simple subgroup of G\u03c3 = G(q), defined over a\nfield of the same characteristic as G, where q, q0 \u2265 4. We classify all such\nX(q0 ). For this we use the classification of maximal subgroups of G\u03c3 . The\nfollowing table is obtained from [10, 1.3A] for p > 2 and [5] for p = 2.\nLemma 5.1. Let M be a maximal subgroup of G\u03c3 = G2 (q) where q = pn \u2265 4.\n13\n\n\fThen M is conjugate to one of the following groups.\n\nID\nGroup\nStructure\nRemarks\n(i)\nPa\n[q 5 ] : GL2 (q)\nparabolic\n(ii)\nPb\n[q 5 ] : GL2 (q)\nparabolic\n(iii)\nCG (s2 ) SL2 (q) \u25e6 SL2 (q).(q \u2212 1, 2)\ninvolution centraliser\n(iv)\nI\n23 .L3 (2)\nq = p, odd\n(v)\nK+\nSL3 (q) : 2\nlong\n(vi)\nK+\u2032\nSL3 (q) : 2\np = 3, short\n(vii)\nK\u2212\nSU3 (q) : 2\nlong\n\u2032\n(viii)\nK\u2212\nSU3 (q) : 2\np = 3, short\n(ix)\nCG (\u03c6)\nG2 (q1 )\nq = q1\u03b1 , \u03b1 a prime\n2\n(x)\nCG (\u03c6)\nG2 (q)\np = 3, n odd\n(xi) P GL2 (q)\np \u2265 7, q \u2265 11\n(xii)\nL2 (8)\nonly if p \u2265 5\n\u221a\n(xiii)\nL2 (13)\np 6= 13, GF (q) = GF (p)[ 13]\nor q = 4\n(xiv)\nG2 (2)\nq=p\u22655\n(xv)\nJ1\nq = 11\n(xvi)\nJ2\nq = 4.\nProof of Theorem 2:\nIf X(q0 ) has rank 2 then it is 2 G2 (q0 ), G2 (q0 ) or A2 (q0 ) and one can see that\nX(q0 ) \u2264 M where M has ID (v)-(x) of the same type as X(q0 ): it is obvious\nfor X(q0 ) of rank 2, M cannot be as in cases (i)-(iv) and (xi); for cases (xii)(xvi) one checks the appropriate pages in the Atlas [6]. Such subgroups are\nunique up to G\u03c3 -conjugacy by [16, 5.1]. Therefore we have X(q0 ) \u2264 X\u0304 a\n\u03c3-stable subgroup of G of the same type.\nWe now consider the case where X(q0 ) has rank 1. Here X(q0 ) \u223c\n= A1 (q0 ). We\nshow that each of these is contained in a \u03c3-stable connected subgroup of type\nA1 \u2264 G. Let X(q0 ) \u2264 M, a maximal subgroup of G\u03c3 . Firstly, if M is case (i)\nor (ii), X(q0 ) \u2264 Pa or Pb and we can use the proof of Theorem 1 to show that\nX(q0 ) is conjugate to a subgroup of a Levi or, when p = 2, to a subgroup\nof one of the \u03c3-stable subgroups Xk,l \u223c\n= A1 defined above: 2.1 implies the\n1\ngroups H (X, V ) are still the same for all q and V being considered, 2.2 still\n\n14\n\n\fapplies for finite groups, and so 3.5 goes through to show that X(q0 ) \u2264 Xk,l ,\na \u03c3-stable subgroup of G as required.\nIf M is as in case (iii), X(q0 ) is embedded in SL2 (q) \u25e6 SL2 (q), twisted by\npr on the first factor and ps on the second. We may assume pr , ps < q.\nSince \u03c3 commutes with the twists on each factor, we have X(q0 ) \u2264 A1 where\nr\ns\nA1 \u0592\u2192 A1 \u00c31 ; x 7\u2192 (x(p ) , xp ) and is clearly \u03c3-stable.\n\nIf X(q0 ) \u2264 M where M has ID (iv) then X(q0 ) = L2 (7) \u223c\n= L3 (2). Checking\n3\n[6, p60] one sees that the subgroup 2 .L3 (2) is a non-split extension with\nnormal subgroup 23 so does not contain a subgroup of type L3 (2).\nWe cannot have X(q0 ) \u2264 M if M has ID (xii) or (xiii) as these do not contain\nsubgroups of type A1 (q0 ), which is easily seen using [6, p6 and p8]\n\nIf M has ID (xi), an A1 (q0 ) = L2 (q0 ) in the P GL2 (q) above is unique up to\nconjugacy and thus in the \u03c3-stable maximal A1 .\nLemma 5.2. Let M have ID (xiv) or (xv). Then X(q0 ) = L2 (7) or L2 (11)\nresp. and it is conjugate to the subgroup L2 (7) \u2264 P GL2 (7) or L2 (11) \u2264\nP GL2 (11) resp. with ID (xi) in the above list.\nProof. Pages 36 and 60 respectively of the Atlas substantiate the fact that\nwe must have X(q0 ) = L2 (7) or L2 (11) (rather than L2 (72 ) or L2 (112 ) for\nexample). Examining the 7-dimensional Brauer characters in the Modular\nAtlas [8] of L2 (7) \u2264 G2 (2) and L2 (7) \u2264 P GL2 (7) one sees that they are irreducible and therefore conjugate in GL7 (7). Similarly, the Brauer characters\nof L2 (11) \u2264 J1 and L2 (11) \u2264 P GL2 (11) in G2 (11) are the same irreducible\nrepresentation and therefore conjugate in GL7 (11). The result [10, 1.5.11]\nthen implies that they are conjugate in G(q0 ). Thus in each case, the subgroup X(q0 ) is in the \u03c3-stable maximal A1 of G.\nLemma 5.3. Let M have ID (v)-(viii). If X(q0 ) is a subgroup of SL3 (q)\nor SU3 (q) and is distinct from those already considered, then q0 is odd and\nX(q0 ) is irreducible on the standard modules in each case. Moreover, each is\ncontained in a \u03c3-stable subgroup of \u01001 \u2264 G.\nProof. The action of A1 (q0 ) on the standard module V for SL3 (q) or SU3 (q)\nmust be irreducible or else it is in a parabolic and already considered. It\nfollows that q0 is odd.\n15\n\n\fThe fact that A1 (q0 ) is irreducible gives the restriction of the three-dimensional\nstandard module as a high weight 2. Thus it is unique up to conjugacy in\nGL3 (q) (or GU3 (q)) by [11, 2.10.4(iii)]. Hence it is contained in a \u03c3-stable\n\u01001 \u2264 A2 .\nLemma 5.4. Let M have ID (xvi). Then X(q0 ) = L2 (4) and X(q0 ) is\ncontained in a subsystem subgroup and is thus already considered.\nProof. Checking the maximal subgroups of J2 in the Atlas, one establishes\nthat A1 (q0 ) = L2 (4) \u223c\n= A5 . A simple Magma [3] calculation in G2 (4) shows\nall of these lie within subsystem subgroups.\nObserve finally that if X(q0 ) \u2264 M for M with ID (ix) or (x) then X(q0 ) is in\nG2 (q0 ) or 2 G2 (q0 ). It is thus in one of its maximal subgroups and has already\nbeen considered, completing the proof of Theorem 2 and this paper.\nAcknowledgements.
