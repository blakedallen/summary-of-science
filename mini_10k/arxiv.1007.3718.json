Introduction\nStellar clusters are among the most universallyuseful entities studied by modern day astronomers.\nHaving a set of singly-aged, same-distance stars\nin an identifiable cluster provides stellar and\ngalactic astronomers with powerful diagnostic\ntools to interpret our universe. Of particular interest is the ability to use the ages and masses\nof constituent stellar clusters to track the star formation history and chemical evolution of a galaxy,\nthe mass function of stellar clusters and their lifetime within differing galaxies (e.g. Lamers et al.\n2005; Piatti et al. 2009; Larsen 2009; Mora et al.\n\n2009; Chandar et al. 2010a). However, such\nmeasures require deriving the ages and masses\nof stellar clusters when the constituent stars\nwithin those clusters are not individually resolved.\nWith distant stellar clusters, one has only the integrated properties to work from, typically in either broad band photometry or integrated spectroscopy, to estimate ages (e.g. Searle et al.\n1980; van den Bergh 1981). In such cases, we\nrely on sophisticated models of these star systems to derive the cluster properties (age, mass,\nchemistry) based on their observed, bulk properties. For this reason there exists a long history\nof effort interpreting integrated cluster proper-\n\n\f2\n\nBogdan Popescu and M.M. Hanson 2010\n\nties through the use of these sophisticated models (e.g. Girardi et al. 1995; Bruzual & Charlot\n2003; Cervi\u00f1o & Valls-Gabaud 2009; Buzzoni\n1989; Chiosi 1989; Bruzual 2002; Bruzual 2010;\nCervi\u00f1o & Luridiana 2004; Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana\n2006; Fagiolini et al. 2007; Lan\u00e7on & Mouhcine\n2000; Lan\u00e7on & Fouesneau 2009; Fouesneau & Lan\u00e7on\n2009; Fouesneau & Lan\u00e7on 2010; Brocato et al.\n1999; Brocato et al. 2000; Cantiello et al. 2003;\nRaimondo et al. 2005; Raimondo 2009; Santos et al.\n2006; Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2004; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pezlira et al.\n2005; Gonz\u00e1lez-L\u00f3pezlira et al. 2010; Ma\u00edz Apell\u00e1niz\n2009; Pessev et al. 2009; Popescu & Hanson\n2010b).\nQuite recently, we presented our own independent effort to provide models for interpreting\nintegrated stellar cluster photometry. Our model,\nMASSCLEAN (MASSive CLuster Evolution and\nANalysis1 \u2013 Popescu & Hanson 2009), is rather\nunique in its design compared to other stellar\ncluster models and provides additional insight\nto interpreting presently available data on stellar clusters. In this paper we first present in\n\u00a72 our recently expanded data-set of 70 million Monte Carlo models, MASSCLEANcolors\n(Popescu & Hanson 2010a). This database of\nmodels shows the stochastic and non-Gaussian\nbehavior of integrated stellar cluster colors and\nmagnitudes as a function of cluster mass and\nage. This, our first, newly completed, extended\ndatabase of models, was selected to match the\nmass, age and metallicity range expected in the\nstellar clusters of the Large Magellanic Cloud\n(LMC). In \u00a73, we demonstrate the utility of this\nextensive database. When used with a statistical inference code we have designed within\nMASSCLEAN called, MASSCLEANage, we use\nthe database to work backwards from the integrated magnitudes and colors of real LMC clusters, to derive their stellar ages and masses. We\nalso discuss our new age results as compared to\nprevious age determinations based on the same\nphotometric data, to provide initial tests on the\ncluster results obtained using MASSCLEANage.\nFinal discussion of our results and conclusions\nare found in \u00a74.\n\n1 http://www.physics.uc.edu/~popescu/massclean/\n\nMASSCLEAN package is freely available unde GNU General\nPublic License\n\n2. The MASSCLEANcolors Database \u2013 Now\nOver 70 Million Monte Carlo Simulations\nWe have computed the integrated colors and\nmagnitudes as a function of mass and age for\na simple stellar cluster. Our results \u2013 the newest\nversion of the MASSCLEANcolors database (Popescu & Hanson\n2010a) \u2013 are based on over 70 million Monte\nCarlo simulations using Padova 2008 (Marigo et al.\n2008) and Geneva (Lejeune & Schaerer 2001)\nisochrones, and for two metalicities, Z = 0.019\n(solar) and Z = .008 (LMC). The simulation were\ndone using Kroupa IMF (Kroupa 2002) with 0.1\nM\u2299 and 120 M\u2299 mass limits. The age range\nof [6.6, 9.5] in log(age/yr) was chosen (similar\nto Popescu & Hanson 2009; Popescu & Hanson\n2010a) to accomodate both Padova and Geneva\nmodels. The mass range is 200-100, 000 M\u2299 . An\naverage of 5000 clusters were simulated for each\nmass and age.\nIn this work we will look closely at a subset of\nthe MASSCLEANcolors database. We present integrated magnitudes and colors (MV , (U \u2212 B)0 ,\n(B \u2212 V )0 ) representing 50 million Monte Carlo\nsimulations using Padova 2008 stellar evolutionary models alone and for the single metallicity,\nZ = .008 ([Fe/H]=-0.6), selected to match the bulk\nproperties of the LMC over most of the past few\nbillion years (Piatti et al. 2009).\n2.1.\n\nThe Distribution of Integrated Colors\nand Magnitudes as a Function of Mass\nand Age\n\nIn Popescu & Hanson 2010a, we analysed the\ninfluence of the stochastic fluctuations in the\nmass function of stellar clusters on their integrated colors as a function of cluster mass. Using\n13 mass intervals ranging from 500\u2013100,000 M\u2299 ,\nwe showed the mean value of the distribution of\nintegrated colors varies with mass. We further\nshowed that the dispersion of integrated colors,\nmeasured by 1\u03c3 (standard deviation), increases\nas the value of the cluster mass decreases. In\nthis new work we will present not just the sigma\nrange and mean, but the full distribution of integrated colors and magnitudes. We are also using\na much larger number of Monte Carlo simulations\nand cluster mass values in the 200\u2013100,000 M\u2299\ninterval. This allows us to look closely at where\n\n\fMASSCLEANage \u2013 Stellar Cluster Ages from Integrated Colors \u2013\n\nthe distribution of real cluster properties lie in the\ncritical color-age and color-color diagrams.\nThe distribution of integrated MV magnitudes\nas a function of mass and age is presented in the\nupper panel of Figure 1. The corresponding mass\nvalues are color-coded and presented in the bottom panel. Sixty-five (65) different mass intervals\nhave been explored in the MASSCLEANcolors\ndatabase as part of this demonstration. All 65\nmass intervals are plotted on top of each other,\nmaking it difficult to see the individual distributions. However, to first order, higher mass clusters have higher absolute magnitudes, MV .\nIn Figures 2 and 3 we present the distribution\nof (B \u2212 V )0 and (U \u2212 B)0 integrated colors as a\nfunction of mass and age. The mass values are\nrepresented by the same colors as shown in the\nbottom panel of Figure 1. The variation of integrated colors computed in the infinite mass limit\n(106 M\u2299 in our simulations) and consistent with\nstandard simple stellar population (SSP) models\nbased on Padova 2008 (Marigo et al. 2008), is\nrepresented by the solid white line in both figures.\nAs was shown in Popescu & Hanson 2010a, the\ndispersion in integrated colors grows larger for\nlower mass clusters, both in the blue and red side.\nAs the cluster mass increases, the dispersion decreases and the integrated colors approach the\ninfinite mass limit shown in white. While it is valuable to see the range of masses over-layed in a\nsingle plot, it is difficult to see the exact shape of\nthe color distributions underlying each mass interval.\n2.2.\n\nThe Shape of the Distribution of Integrated Colors and Magnitudes\n\nWe have selected a few single values of mass\nfor independent plots in Figures 4\u20136. The distribution of integrated MV magnitudes is presented in Figure 4, for clusters mass of 200,\n1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 M\u2299 ,\nrespectively. The colors are the same as the\nones used in Figure 1. What is also given in\na black line is the mean value of the distribution of integrated MV magnitudes for that mass\n(Popescu & Hanson 2010a). Several very critical\neffects are immediately apparent. The distribution (range) of observed integrated magnitudes\nfor low mass clusters gets very large with lower\n\n3\n\nmass clusters. This was already presented in\nPopescu & Hanson 2010a. However, the shape\nof that dispersion was not presented like we have\ndone here. Here we see in Fig. 4, particularly\nwith 200 and 1,000 solar mass clusters, the distribution becomes bimodal for the lowest mass\nclusters, especially for young ages (log t \u2264 8.0).\nA cluster with no more than 200 solar masses\ncan, at times, have an absolute magnitude typical\nof a cluster 25 \u2212 100 times more massive and at\nthe same age. Even if one can derive an accurate age for their cluster, one can not rely on the\nabsolute magnitude alone to derive mass unambiguously.\nIn Figures 5 and 6 we present the distribution\nof integrated colors (B \u2212 V )0 and (U \u2212 B)0 as\na function of age for the same select values of\ncluster mass, 200, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000,\nand 50,000 M\u2299 , respectively. The integrated colors as a function of age, computed in the infinite\nmass limit (106 M\u2299 in our simulations) is represented by the solid black line. Here the structure\nin the values observed start out closely aligned\nwith the classical SSP codes predictions (infinite mass limit) for the high mass clusters, but\nquickly fans out to a rather broad distribution below 10,000 M\u2299 . When one gets below 1,000 M\u2299 ,\nthe color range is extreme, both in the red and\nblue colors predicted by our models. Moreover,\nthe distribution shows a clear bimodal distribution\n(Popescu & Hanson 2010a; Lan\u00e7on & Mouhcine\n2002; Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana 2004; Fagiolini et al.\n2007). In Popescu & Hanson 2010a, we discussed the increased dispersion in colors as the\ncluster mass decreased, though we did not investigate masses as low as shown here. However,\neven clusters with masses of 1,000 to as much as\n5,000 M\u2299 show an extraordinary range in colors,\naway from the predicted SSP single expectation\nvalue with age.\n2.3.\n\nThe Distribution of Integrated Colors in\nthe Color-Color Diagram\n\nAll the data from Figures 2 and 3 are again presented in Figure 7 as a (U \u2212 B)0 vs. (B \u2212 V )0\ncolor-color diagram.

Models were generated with\n65 different masses and evolved following Padova 2008 evolutionary models. Higher mass clusters are plotted over\npreceded lower mass clusters. This figure gives the (partially correct) impression that MV monotonically increases with\ncluster mass for all ages.\n\n\fMASSCLEANage \u2013 Stellar Cluster Ages from Integrated Colors \u2013\n\n5\n\nFig. 2.- The results from the same 50 million Monte Carlo simulations as shown in Figure 1 and using the same\ncolor coding to represent cluster mass. The range of (B \u2212 V )0 colors, as a function of mass and age is given. Again,\nhigher mass clusters are plotted over preceded lower mass clusters, so covers the real distribution of expected colors\nas a function of mass and age. A white line which lies at the color center, represents the color dependence with age\ncomputed in the infinite mass limit (106 M\u2299 in our simulations). This figure gives the (correct) impression that the range\nof cluster colors observed as a function of age, is greatly increased for lower mass clusters.\n\n\f6\n\nBogdan Popescu and M.M. Hanson 2010\n\nFig. 3.- The same as Figure 2, only this figure shows (U \u2212 B)0 colors as a function of mass and age.\n\n\fMASSCLEANage \u2013 Stellar Cluster Ages from Integrated Colors \u2013\n\n7\n\nFig. 4.- Beginning in the upper left panel, the black line shows the mean value of the distribution of integrated MV\ncolors for a 50,000 M\u2299 cluster. The red points are MASSCLEAN, Monte Carlo derived observed magnitudes for a\n50,000 M\u2299 cluster, as a function of age. Over one million models are used to derive the red points in this figure. The\ndistribution seen about the mean value is relatively small. In the next panel to the right, is given the magnitudes, as\na function of age, for Monte Carlo derived cluster with mass, 25,000 M\u2299 . The black line is the mean value of the\ndistribution of integrated MV colors for a 25,000 M\u2299 cluster. In the following 4 subfigures, we provide lower and lower\nmass simulated clusters, 10,000 (upper right), then 5,000 (lower left), 1,000 (lower center) and finally 200 M\u2299 (lower\nright), all the while showing the mean value of the distribution of integrated MV colors for the corresponding clusters\nmass. For clusters with masses of only a few thousand solar mass, the observed range becomes extremely large, and\ncan even mimic clusters of lower or even considerably higher total mass.\n\n\f8\n\nBogdan Popescu and M.M. Hanson 2010\n\nFig. 5.- Like with Figure 4, we have selected six mass examples (50,000, 25,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1000, and 200 M\u2299 )\nto show the observed distribution of (B \u2212 V )0 colors as a function of age, compared to the infinite mass limit (in the\nblack line, the same for all six plots). For the higher mass clusters, 50,000 and 25,000 M\u2299 , the range of colors is small\nand stays reasonably close to the values computed in the infinite mass limit. However, in the remaining panels one\nsees that the observed values from our simulations can demonstrate rather extreme colors, bluer, but more so very red\ncolors at times, for increasingly lower mass clusters.\n\nFig. 6.- This is the same as for Figure 5, only here we show the variation with mass and age of (U \u2212 B)0 colors, as\nderived through Monte Carlo simulations using MASSCLEAN.\n\n\fMASSCLEANage \u2013 Stellar Cluster Ages from Integrated Colors \u2013\n\nmasses given are color-coded similarly to Figure\n1. Provided the mass of the cluster is greater than\n50,000 M\u2299 (in the pink), the predicted properties\nof our Monte Carlo generated clusters stays reasonably close to the integrated colors computed\nin the infinite mass limit. For clusters with masses\nless than 10,000 M\u2299 (the dark green just beyond\nthe yellow), the range of possible colors becomes\nquite large, overlapping heavily with many different aged clusters and causing enormous degeneracy problems.\nThe classical method for cluster age determination using integrated colors is based mainly on\nthe (U \u2212 B)0 vs. (B \u2212 V )0 color-color diagram.\nThe large dispersion presented in Figure 7 shows\nthe limitation of this method when only the infinite mass limit is used. To better view what is\nhappening in the complex Figure 7, we show another view of this data in Figure 8. Here, we apply an entirely new color scheme to represent our\nMonte Carlo simulations. In Figure 8 we plot the\ncolor-color diagram for 5 ages (log(age/yr)= 7.00,\n7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00) and all values of mass between 200\u2013100,000 M\u2299 . Clusters of all masses\nare shown now color coded based on age. Combining this with what we have learned from Figure\n7, Figure 8 shows us that even very young low\nmass clusters can mimic the UBV colors of more\nmassive old clusters. The extreme tail of colors\nbelongs solely to intermediate and low mass clusters. It is easy to see that very young clusters\n(log(age/yr)= 7.00, 7.50) could be mistaken for\n1 billion years old (log(age/yr)= 9.00) clusters,\nbased on the single SSP relationship in a classical UBV diagram.\nThe (U \u2212 B)0 versus (B \u2212 V )0 color-color diagram is a very important tool in age determination of stellar clusters. The high level of dispersion\nshown in Figures 7 and 8 demonstrates the limitations of this method when only the infinite mass\nlimit is used. The degeneracy seems to be so extreme, one might think all is lost. But in fact, the\npurpose of our extensive database was not just\nto show the range and degeneracy of the colors\nwith age and mass (and here we have only limited ourselves to a single IMF, chemistry and evolutionary model), but to see if by producing such\na database, we might provide a reasonable grid\nof properties from which to work back and derive\ncluster ages and masses.\n\n2.4.\n\n9\n\nMass and Age Are Degenerate Quantities in UBV Colors\n\nFigures 1 through 8 demonstrate the very difficult condition one faces in deriving unique ages\nof stellar clusters when mass is not given full consideration. In creating the MASSCLEANcolors\ndatabase, we have created a distribution function of observed photometric properties with age\nand mass. Our figures demonstrate just the\nUBV bands, however, our MASSCLEANcolors\ndatabase includes all photometric bands presently\nincluded in the Padova 2008 model release: UBVRIJHK. While our figures seem to indicate there\nis little to match on, in fact, when simultaneously\nsolving all three unique values of UBV (U \u2212 B,\nB \u2212 V and MV ) , there will be optimized, or most\nlikely solutions when one searches in both age\nand mass grid space. If additional photometric\nbands are available for a cluster, this can be further used to constrain the cluster properties. The\nmodule which will provide such a search we call\nMASSCLEANage.\n3. Age Determination for Stellar Clusters \u2013\nMASSCLEANage\nThe newest addition to the MASSCLEAN package\n(Popescu & Hanson 2009) is MASSCLEANage2 ,\na program which uses the MASSCLEANcolors\ndatabase (Popescu & Hanson 2010a) to determine the ages of stellar clusters.\nOur program, MASSCLEANage, is based on a\nmethod analogous to \u03c72 minimization3 . Based\non the observational data, integrated magnitude\nand integrated colors, it searches for the minimum hyper-radius in the integrated magnitude, integrated colors, age, and mass hyperspace. This\nwork specifically is based on a MV , (U \u2212 B)0 ,\n(B \u2212 V )0 , age, and mass hyperspace due to the\navailability of integrated U BV colors and magnitudes from Hunter et al. 2003, but the code can\nprovide results based on more colors. The most\n2 As\n\npart\nof\nthe\nMASSCLEAN\npackage,\nMASSCLEANage\nis\nopen\nsource\nand\nfreely\navailable\nunder\nGNU\nGeneral\nPublic\nLicense\nat:\nhttp://www.physics.uc.edu/~popescu/massclean/\n3 \u03c72 minimization provides reliable results in the case of Gaussian distribution, so it did not apply to low and medium mass\nclusters.\n\n\f10\n\nBogdan Popescu and M.M. Hanson 2010\n\nFig. 7.- The result of 50 million Monte Carlo simulations, color coded by mass as described in Figure 1. Here we see\nthe full range of color-color magnitudes predicted as a function of mass. Clusters more massive than 50,000 M\u2299 (in the\npink) typically adhere closely to the predicted values for the single solution Padova-based SSP predictions, computed\nin the infinite mass limit. However, clusters with masses below 10,000 M\u2299 (the dark green just beyond the yellow) can\nshow extreme color ranges.\n\n\fMASSCLEANage \u2013 Stellar Cluster Ages from Integrated Colors \u2013\n\nprobable values for age and mass are reported,\nalong with a list of other possible matches. The\nnumber of possible matches could be selected\nby the user or could be automatically computed\nbased on the photometric errors. The results\ncould be used to generate the confidence levels\nfor age and mass (as presented in Tables 1 and 2\nand Figure 9), or to generate the age-mass probability distributions (as presented in Figure 10).\nBy including additional bands (e.g. (V \u2212 K)0 )\nthe accuracy in the age and mass determination\nwould increase, and could minimize the degeneracies. In order to do it, a much larger version\nof the database is required, since the range of\nstochastic fluctuations is much larger in (V \u2212 K)0\n(Popescu & Hanson 2010a).\n3.1.\n\nAge and Mass Determination for LMC\nClusters\n\nAs a first demonstration of the MASSCLEANage\ncode, we compare our values of ages for 7 clusters with both spectroscopic ages (Santos et al.\n2006) and photometric ages (Hunter et al. 2003).\nOur results are computed using the previously dereddened values of MV , (U \u2212 B)0 , and (B \u2212 V )0\nfrom the Hunter et al. 2003 catalog. The data is\npresented in Table 1. The integrated photometry and age from Hunter et al. 2003 is presented\nin the columns 2\u20135, and the spectroscopic ages\nfrom Santos et al. 2006 is presented in the column 6. The MASSCLEANage results are presented in the columns 7\u20139. The same data is\nalso presented in Figure 9 (a), (b). The integrated\n(U \u2212 B)0 and (B \u2212 V )0 colors are presented in\nFigure 8 as pink squares.\nThe ages computed using MASSCLEANage\nare in good agreement with the spectroscopic\nages from Santos et al. 2006. One object in Figure 9 still lies significantly away from the predicted\nage, as derived by Santos et al. 2006, even using\nMASSCLEANage. We investigated a few of the\nsources in this diagram by looking closely at the\nminimization solutions found within the MASSCLEANage hyperspace. Absolutely every mass\nand age range available was specifically calculated against the observed UBV colors. This\noutput was used to create the likelihood plots\nshown in Figure 10. These banana-shaped diagrams demonstrate the very strong degeneracy\n\n11\n\nin UBV colors between age and mass. Here\nwe see that for NGC 1894, which represents the\nmost significantly desperate point found in Figure 9 (b), our best solution for the age does not\nmatch that derived by Santos et al. 2006 via integrated spectroscopy, but agrees with the age from\nHunter et al. 2003. If the older Santos et al. 2006\nage is correct, then this cluster is fairly massive\n(\u2265 15,000 M\u2299 based on Figure 10).\n3.2.\n\nFurther Tests of the MASSCLEANage\nProgram\n\nRegrettably, the Santos et al. 2006 study has\nonly a small overlap with the Hunter et al. 2003\ncatalog of clusters, a consistent, high quality UBV\ndataset with SSP derived ages. But we wish\nto provide a further test of the MASSCLEANage\npackage. The Hunter et al. 2003 study includes\nover 900 LMC clusters, but only a fraction of those\nclusters are good examples. By this we mean,\ntheir location in the color-color diagram allows\nthem to be more clearly aged using SSP models.\nWe selected a subset of 30 clusters, which\ncover a wide range of (U \u2212 B)0 and (B \u2212 V )0 colors, but are also located close to the infinite mass\nlimit (see the yellow triangles in Figure 8). The selected clusters are given in Table 2. Due to their\nlocations in the color-color diagram, the age determination based on the classical \u03c72 minimization methods and infinite mass limit is expected\nto be relatively accurate (e.g. Lan\u00e7on & Mouhcine\n2000; Popescu & Hanson 2010a). As shown in\nFigure 11, our MASSCLEANage results are in\ngood agreement with the ages from Hunter et al.\n2003 based on SSP model fits. However, we\ncan also derive the mass, and this is presented\nin column 8 of the Table 2. New values for age\nand mass for all the clusters with U BV colors in\nthe Hunter et al. 2003 catalog and derived using\nMASSCLEANage will be presented in a subsequent paper (Popescu et al. 2010, in preparation).\n4. Discussion & Conclusions\nThat there would be degeneracies in the UBV\ncolor-color diagrams affecting the derivation of\nage as shown in Figures 7 and 8, was previously recognized by many (e.g. Bruzual & Charlot\n\n\f12\n\nBogdan Popescu and M.M. Hanson 2010\n\nFig. 8.- Monte Carlo cluster simulations colored by age for log(age/yr) = 7.00, 7.50, 8.00, 8.50, 9.00. Here we show\nthat young clusters of low mass can be found to reside in the region that the infinite mass limit predict for old stellar\nclusters. For a comparison with the observational data, the clusters from Hunter et al. 2003 catalog are displayed as\nblack dots. The clusters with photometric ages from Santos et al. 2006 (also presented in Table 1) are highlighted with\npink squares. All the clusters presented in Table 2 are highlighted with yellow triangles.\n\n\f13\n\nMASSCLEANage \u2013 Stellar Cluster Ages from Integrated Colors \u2013\n\nTABLE 1\nR ESULTS\nIntegrated Photometrya\nName\n1\nNGC 1804\nNGC 1839\nSL 237\nNGC 1870\nNGC 1894\nNGC 1913\nNGC 1943\n\nMV\n(mag)\n2\n\u22126.493\n\u22127.087\n\u22126.951\n\u22127.493\n\u22127.956\n\u22127.547\n\u22127.255\n\na\n\nHunter et al. 2003\n\nb\n\nSantos et al. 2006\n\nSpectroscopyb\n\nMASSCLEAN\n\n(U \u2212 B)0\n(mag)\n3\n\n(B \u2212 V )0\n(mag)\n4\n\nAge\n(M yr)\n5\n\nAge\n(M yr)\n6\n\nAge\n(M yr)\n7\n\nAge\n(log)\n8\n\nMass\n(M\u2299 )\n9\n\n\u22120.523\n\u22120.347\n\u22120.494\n\u22120.423\n\u22120.550\n\u22120.493\n\u22120.359\n\n\u22120.103\n0.002\n0.156\n0.082\n0.192\n0.257\n0.137\n\n19.1 \u00b1 7.21\n16.2 \u00b1 7.16\n15.2 \u00b1 7.02\n15.8 \u00b1 7.54\n15.0 \u00b1 8.02\n14.6 \u00b1 7.72\n15.5 \u00b1 7.31\n\n60 \u00b1 20\n90 \u00b1 30\n40 \u00b1 20\n60 \u00b1 30\n100 \u00b1 30\n40 \u00b1 20\n140 \u00b1 60\n\n+15.16\n29.51\u221211.73\n+18.76\n72.44\u221232.63\n+10.07\n38.90\u221213.78\n+23.96\n43.65\u22128.98\n+14.59\n20.89\u22121.40\n+11.55\n33.11\u22129.12\n+7.66\n79.43\u221231.57\n\n7.47+0.18\n\u22120.22\n7.86+0.10\n\u22120.26\n7.59+0.10\n\u22120.19\n7.64+0.19\n\u22120.10\n7.32+0.23\n\u22120.03\n7.52+0.13\n\u22120.14\n7.90+0.04\n\u22120.22\n\n2, 000+2,000\n\u22121,300\n8, 000+2,000\n\u22124,000\n5, 000+1,000\n\u22123,000\n8, 000+4,000\n\u22122,000\n7, 000+5,000\n\u22121,000\n7, 000+2,000\n\u22122,000\n10, 000+1,000\n\u22124,000\n\n2003; Cervi\u00f1o & Valls-Gabaud 2009; Buzzoni\nThe MASSCLEANcolors database is suffi1989; Chiosi 1989; Bruzual 2002; Bruzual 2010;\nciently populated now so it can be used to work\nCervi\u00f1o & Luridiana 2004; Cervi\u00f1o & Luridiana\nback and derive mass and age for moderate and\n2006; Fagiolini et al. 2007; Lan\u00e7on & Mouhcine\nlower mass clusters in the LMC with a known\n2000; Lan\u00e7on & Fouesneau 2009; Fouesneau & Lan\u00e7on (correctable) extinction.
