In practice, these events will be decomposed into a number of smaller in magnitude, but still large too,\nseismic events located at normally different seismogenic areas.\nKey words: seismic potential, accelerated deformation, earthquake magnitude, seismic energy.\n\n1. Introduction.\nGenerally, the term \"seismic hazard\" of a region refers to a quantity \" H\" which depends on the expected seismic motion\nintensity of that region. The seismic hazard is usually expressed in terms of ground acceleration, ground velocity, ground\ndislocation or as macroseismic intensity (Papazachos et al. 1989).\nSuch a typical seismic hazard map for the Greek territory was compiled by Papazachos et al. (1989) which is presented in\nthe following figure (1) at left. The entire Greek territory has been divided into four different zones, scaling from (I) to (IV),\nwith the (I) scale being the one with the lowest value of seismic hazard.\nLater on, after the occurrence of some large EQs in Greece, the seismic hazard map of 1989 was modified by OASP\n(2004) and the new seismic hazard map consists of three zones only. That map is presented in the middle of figure (1).\nThe seismic hazard of an area mainly depends upon its seismicity. Therefore, the variability of the seismicity of an area,\nat some time scale, suggests variable seismic hazard. The latter indicates the necessity of a more frequent seismic hazard\nmap compilation or the use of the so called \"seismic potential map\" (Thanassoulas et al. 2003, Thanassoulas 2007). What\nis presented in the seismic potential map is the spatial distribution of the seismic energy (in terms of Ms) stored in the\nanalyzed area. Consequently, what is presented is the maximum expected magnitude of an earthquake, at any place of the\nmap, when it occurs. In figure (1) at right, is presented the seismic potential map of Greece calculated for the year 2000.\n\nFig. 1. Left: Map of ground acceleration ( Papazachos 1989). Middle: its recent revision (OASP, 2004) and Right: seismic\npotential map for the year 2000 (Thanassoulas et al. 2003, Thanassoulas 2007).\nThe seismic potential map was compiled with a calculated earthquake lower magnitude threshold of Ms = 6.0 R and was\ncompared to the corresponding followed up seismicity. It was found that decreased in size extent seismically charged\n\n1\n\n\fareas (brown colored areas) were followed by decreased large (Ms>6.0R) seismicity. Moreover, an increase of the stored\nseismic energy corresponding to only a half (0.5R) of a unit of the Richter scale, which resulted in to a wider colored area,\ncorresponded to a large increase of the large earthquake seismicity, which coincided quite well to the suggested by the\nseismic potential map seismic energy charged areas (Thanassoulas 2008, 2008a, 2008b).\nIn this work we calculated the seismic potential maps of Greece for the years 2005 and 2010 (end of 2009) and compare\nthem to the seismicity that took place in the period of time from the year 2000 until start of the year 2010.\n\n2. Map compilation and analysis.\nThe earthquake data, which we used for this work, were downloaded from the web site of the National Observatory of\nAthens. The earthquake catalog which covers the period 1901 to 2009 was used for the compilation of both seismic\npotential maps. The processing of the data was performed by using the methodology which was presented by\nThanassoulas et al. (2001, 2003) and Thanassoulas (2007, 2008b).\nIn the following figure (2) the compiled maps are presented.\n\nFig. 2. Calculated seismic potential maps of Greece for the years 2005 (left) and 2010 (right). Colored areas indicate the\nmaximum EQ magnitude (in Ms) expected at each case (see corresponding color bar).\n\nAt a first glance, there is no significant difference between these two maps. However, a closer inspection indicates that\nthe 2010 map suggests a rather larger degree of seismic energy charge. This is more evident if only the range of\n7.0R>Ms>6.5R is being considered. In order to evaluate the compiled maps, these will be compared to the seismicity of the\nfollowing 5 years period with various seismic magnitude minimum thresholds and for different seismic potential lower\nthresholds. At the background of each map, simultaneously, are presented, as gray thick lines, the deep lithospheric\nfracture zones deduced by the analysis of the corresponding gravity field (Thanassoulas 1998, 2007).\nFor each map a (P) value will be calculated which indicates the percentage (Pin / Ptot) of the total number Pin of the\nEQs that did occur in the indicated seismically charged zones over the Ptot of the total number of large EQs that took\nplace all over the Greek territory.\nP = Pin / Ptot.\n(1)\nThat is\nFollowing in figure (3, 4, 5) is analyzed the seismic potential map of year 2005.\n\nSeismicity lower threshold = 6.0R.\n\nP = 13 / 13 = 1.0 or 100%\n\nP = 12 / 13 = .923 or 92.3%\n\n2\n\n\fP = 7 / 13 = 0.538 or 53.8%\n\nP = 1 / 13 = .077 or 7.7%\n\nFig. 3.

Obviously\nsuch a comparison can be utilized by any interested researcher in the future after the year 2015. In the mean time we can\ncompare the specific map of 2010 to the large seismicity which took place during the past ten (10) years.

(2003) and Thanassoulas (2007, 2008b), regarding the seismic potential of\nthe Greek territory, it was shown that the latter changes quite fast within a five years period of time. Consequently, the\nseismic hazard map of Greece, calculated for any time, is valid only for a rather short time period. Therefore, it is\nsuggested to use, instead of the traditional seismologically compiled seismic hazard map, the seismic potential map, that\nis a more direct way to evaluate the seismic hazard of a study area.\nAt this point it is worth to recall the large (Ms>6.0R) seismicity that followed, the next five years period of time (20012005), after the seismic potential map was calculated for the year 2000 and to compare it with the one of 2005 and its\nsubsequent large seismicity of the next five years (2005 \u2013 2009). This is demonstrated in the following figure (9).\n\n6\n\n\fMap of year 2000 (EQs of 2000 \u2013 2005)\n\nMap of Year 2005 (EQs of 2005 \u2013 2009)\n\nP = 4 / 7 = 0.57 or 57%\nP = 6 / 7 = 0.86 or 86%\n\nP = 12 / 13 = .923 or 92.3%\n\nFig. 9. Comparison of the seismic potential maps of 2000 (left) and 2005 (right) with the large (Ms>6.0R) seismicity that took\nplace during the periods 2000 \u2013 2005 and 2005 \u2013 2009 (end). The second (lower line) P value of 2000 map is obtained\nafter accepting the double seismic event at eastern Greece as of a marginal hit.\nWhat is very interesting in figure (9) is the fact that an increase for 0.5R of the observed seismic potential from 2000 to\n2005 resulted into triggering almost double the number of large EQs (from 7 to 13) within the next five years period while\nthe hit rate (EQs in the predefined areas) remained at a high level (57.0% - 92.3% ).\nA different example of such a change in the seismic potential is presented by comparing the seismic potential map of\nGreece compiled for the year 2000 to the one compiled for the year 2010. The latter is presented in the following figure (10).\n\nFig. 10. Comparison of the seismic potential map of Greece compiled for the year 2000 (left) and the year 2010 (right).\nEQs of Ms>=6.8R for 1901 \u2013 2009 are shown in blue circles.\n\nIt is made clear that within 10 years period of time a rather large increase of the seismic potential occurred. This had as\nan effect the occurrence of 20 large EQs (Ms > 6.0R) for the same time period. The seismic potential levels of 7.0R > Ms >\n6.5R exhibit the largest seismicity effect. The corresponding hit rate (EQs within the specified seismic potential area) of the\noccurred large EQs ranges from 53.8% to 100% which we consider as quite satisfactory.\nA more general comparison is made of the seismic potential maps compiled for the years 2000 and 2010 (fig. 10) to the\nlarge (Ms>6.8R) seismicity of the period 1901 \u2013 2009. It is clearly shown that the majority of the large seismicity takes place\nin the dark-brown and red colored seismic potential areas (Ms>7.0R) while at the same time highly seismic potential\ncharged areas are prescribed quite well by clusters of large EQs (fig. 10 right).\nThe observed seismic potential charge difference, between the map of year 2000 to the map of year 2010, suggests that\nthe Greek territory, during these last 10 years, is being charged continuously which in turn indicates that the observed in\nthe recent years large seismicity has not come yet to an end.\n\n7\n\n\fA more remarkable feature of the seismic potential maps of 2005 and 2010 is their cyclic character. It is clearly shown\nthat the seismic potential decreases drastically in the centre of the Aegean plate (white colored area). A comparison of a\nlower level seismicity of Ms = 4.5R, for the entire period of 1901 to 2009, to the seismic potential map of 2010 results into a\nvery good agreement. The latter is shown in the following figure (11).\n\nFig. 11. Comparison of the seismic potential map of\nGreece compiled for the year 2010 to the corresponding\nseismicity (blue circles) of Ms = 4.5R for the time period\nof 1901 to 2009.\n\nThe case of the Kythira EQ (Ms = 6.4R, January 2006) is a very good example of the use of the seismic potential maps.\nThe seismic potential map of year 2005, with a minimum threshold of 7.5R shown in figure (12), indicated three \"red\"\nnarrow zones in the entire Greek territory. The first one is located at north, at the Greek \u2013 Bulgarian frontiers and the other\ntwo are located at the southern part of Greece. The one located at the left is the Kythira area. The blue circle indicates the\nseismologically calculated epicenter of the same EQ. Therefore, if this map had been calculated at the right time (end of\n2005) it could be possible to have been warned about the seismic status of this seismogenic region in Greece.\n\nFig. 12. Narrow areas of Greek territory (red color)\ncharged (at 2005) with seismic energy capable to\ngenerate an EQ of Ms>7.5R. The Kythira EQ coincides\nto the southern left one of them.\n\nIt is important to point out that the Kythira seismogenic area is still highly charged (Thanassoulas, 2007) and capable to\ngenerate large EQs in the future. The very same charged condition is suggested by the seismic potential map of figure (12).\nBy comparing the seismic potential maps generated for the period of 1975 \u2013 2000 to the similar maps compiled for the\nyears 2005 and 2010 it is identified an observable increase of the seismic potential of the entire Greek territory. Therefore,\nwe will consider the entire Greek territory as a single seismogenic unit region and will analyze it in terms of accelerated\ndeformation. The method to be used is the one of the lithospheric seismic energy flow model postulated by Thanassoulas\n(2007, 2008a).\nThe cumulative seismic energy release in the entire Greek territory is presented as a function of time (one month\nsampling interval) in figure (13)\n\n8\n\n\fFig. 13. Calculated cumulative seismic\nenergy release in the entire Greek\nterritory for the time period of 1901 to\n2009.\n\nFrom the previous graph it is possible to calculate the maximum expected magnitude of a future large EQ by choosing\nthe appropriate \"normal seismic energy release\" function and its time of occurrence. The term \"normal seismic energy\nrelease\" means the one according to which no \"lock\" state exists in the seismogenic region and all the seismic energy\nrelease, theoretically, takes place through, a continuous in time, large number of small magnitude seismicity. Following\nare presented four different scenarios for the calculation of the maximum expected magnitude.\n\nModel \u2013 3. Ms = 8.0R\n\nModel \u2013 4. Ms = 8.3R\n\nFig. 14. Four different scenarios (models-1, 2, 3, 4) are presented for the calculation of the maximum expected magnitude\n(in Ms) of a large EQ in the Greek territory.\nAlthough different features of the cumulative seismic energy release graph have been used, at different periods of time,\nthe result is more or less the same. The expected maximum magnitude ranges from Ms = 7.99R to Ms = 8.43R with an\naverage value of Ms = 8.18R. In practice, these \"virtual\" events will be decomposed into a number of smaller, but still\nlarge, seismic events which will take place, generally, at different seismogenic areas.\nFurther more we observe, from figure (13), that the Greek territory, since 1975, has entered a rather long \"quiescence\"\nperiod which has turn into an accelerated one after 1986. This is shown in the following figure (15) being a magnified part\nof figure (13).\n\n9\n\n\fFig. 15. Accelerated deformation observed for the\nperiod of 1986 to 2009.\n\nA sixth order polynomial (fig. 16) has been fitted to the data of figure (15) for the following reasons. The first one is to\nmake clearer the increase of the cumulative seismic energy release and the second is to utilize the analytical determination\nof the gradient (fig. 17) in time of the cumulative seismic energy release so that the accelerated deformation becomes more\nevident.\n\nth\n\nFig. 16. 6 order polynomial fitted on the data of\nthe cumulative seismic energy release for the\nperiod from 1986 to 2010.\n\nFig. 17. Analytical time gradient of figure (16). It is\nclear that a considerable increase of the\naccelerated deformation has started since 2004 and\nis still increasing.\n\nSimilar cases, calculated for specific seismogenic areas in the past, which have been presented by Thanassoulas (2007),\nwere followed by large EQs just after the calculated gradient achieved, as a graph, its sharper rise. For this case, and for\nthe entire Greek territory, it is estimated that some rather large EQ is quite possible to take place within the next 1 \u2013 3\nyears.\nIn conclusion, the seismic potential maps, which were calculated for the years 2005 and 2010, provided us with valuable\ninformation about the seismic status of the Greek territory, the specific seismogenic highly charged areas where large EQs\ndo often occur and moreover inform us on what is possible to expect as maximum seismic activity in the entire Greek\nterritory in the next years to come.\n\n4.
