Turbulence is an outstanding and intricate example, which can be described as an\noriented stationary flow of energy or particles between\ndifferent scales. This idea of an energy cascade goes\nback to the work of Richardson in the context of atmospheric science [1]. Kolmogorov, in his 1941 mathematical discussion of turbulence in an incompressible\nfluid, added the concept of universality and scaling [2].\nMore recently, turbulence has been studied in the context\nof the inflationary early universe as well as of strongly\ncorrelated matter produced in heavy-ion collisions [3\u2013\n7].Dynamical critical phenomena, i.e., fixed points of\nthe evolution away from thermal equilibrium have been\nproposed. They potentially affect the equilibration process by forcing the evolution to critically slow down before final thermalization. New scaling laws were found\nby analysing non-perturbative Kadanoff-Baym dynamic\nequations [4, 5]. Analogous predictions for a nonrelativistic Bose gas were given in [6], proposing strong matterwave turbulence in the regime of long-range excitations.\nSuperfluid turbulence, also referred to as quantum turbulence (QT) has been the subject of extensive studies\nin the context of helium [9]. In contrast to eddies in classical fluids vorticity in a superfluid is quantized [10, 11],\nand the creation and annihilation processes of quantized\nvortices are distinctly different [9]. The observation of\na Kolmogorov 5/3-law [2] in experiments with superfluid\nhelium, cf. [12] for a review, received much attention [13\u2013\n19]. In particular, the role of the normal-fluid as compared to the superfluid component in the turbulent flow\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: t.gasenzer@uni-heidelberg.de\n\nis under debate [9]. In the context of the kinetics of condensation and the development of long-range order in a\ndilute Bose gas, the role of turbulence in the superfluid\nand its acoustic excitations was discussed in Refs. [20, 21],\nsee also [22] for a recent review. A possible observation of\nQT in ultracold atomic gases presently poses an exciting\ntask for experiments [23, 24].\nA satisfactory ab-initio mathematical description of\nboth quantum and classical turbulence is inherently difficult due to the generically strong correlations building\nup within the system. Analytical results are known, however, in regimes where kinetic theory applies: In a dilute,\ndegenerate Bose gas the normal-fluid component can vary\nat the expense or gain of the superfluid part. As a consequence, the gas is compressible and so-called weak waveturbulence phenomena can occur. For these, scaling laws\ncan be derived by analysing kinetic equations [25].\nRecent developments presented in Refs. [4\u20136, 8] allow\nto set up a unifying description of scaling, both in the ultraviolet quantum-Boltzmann kinetic regime and in the\ninfrared (IR) regime of long wavelengths where perturbative approximations break down. In the IR regime, new\nscaling laws were found [4] by analysing non-perturbative\nKadanoff-Baym dynamic equations with respect to nonthermal stationary solutions.\nHere, we study QT in two and three dimensional dilute\nBose gases by means of simulations in the classical-wave\nlimit of the underlying quantum field theory. We\ncompare the scaling exponents of the single-particle momentum distribution and their analytical predictions [6].\nWhile we find excellent agreement, our results provide\nan interpretation of the dynamical fixed points proposed\nin Refs. [4, 6] for the case of an ultracold Bose gas: The\nappearance of nonperturbative infrared scaling reflects\nthe presence of independent vortices. Moreover, the\npower spectra of underlying compressible excitations\nsuggest an understanding in terms of acoustic turbulence\n[25] on the top of the vorticity-bearing quasicondensate.\n\n\f2\n\nScaling laws: Analytical Predictions. Based on the concept of universality, the turbulent single-particle spectrum n(k) is assumed to scale as\nn(sk) = s\u2212\u03b6 n(k),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is some positive real number. This scaling law\nis compatible with a more general scaling behaviour assumed for the full two-point correlation function of the\nbosonic quantum field as discussed in Ref. [6].\nTo determine the positive exponent \u03b6 in the infrared,\nwhere n(k) \u223c |k|\u2212\u03b6 is large, an approach beyond kinetic weak-wave-turbulence theory has been used. This\nis based on analysing fixed points of Kadanoff-Baym dynamic equations derived from the two-particle irreducible\n(2PI) effective action or \u03a6-functional [26]. While in the\nregime of large wave numbers the approach goes over\ninto the kinetic description of weak wave turbulence,\nan effectively renormalised many-body T -matrix modifies the scaling law in the IR. This is a consequence of\nthe resummation of a particular class of Feynman diagrams contributing to the 2PI effective action [4, 6], a\nformulation substantially beyond the low-order perturbative expansion used for the kinetic quantum Boltzmann\nequation. Physically, the renormalised T -matrix implies\na reduction of the effective interaction strength in the\nIR regime of strongly occupied modes [4]. As a consequence, single-particle occupation numbers rise, towards\nsmaller wave numbers, in a steeper way than in the weakturbulence regime. The IR scaling exponent for constant\nradial quasiparticle flow in d dimensions was predicted in\nRef. [6] as\nIR\n\u03b6 = \u03b6Q\n= d + 2.\n\n(2)\n\nSemiclassical field simulations. A dilute superfluid\nBose gas can be described, in the classical-wave limit,\nby the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u22072\n2\n\u0131\u2202t \u03c8(x, t) = \u2212\n(3)\n+ g|\u03c8(x, t)| \u03c8(x, t).\n2m\n(In our units ~ = 1). m is the boson mass, and g quantifies the interaction strength. We consider a gas in a\nbox of size Ld , d = 2, 3, with periodic boundary conditions. Diluteness implies that a \u226a l, the interparticle\nspacing l = n\u22121/d being determined by the mean density\nn = N/Ld . The initial values for the real and imaginary\nparts of the field \u03c8(k, 0) were randomly chosen from a\nGaussian distribution with width 1/2, centred around\np\nn(k, 0) exp{i\u03c6(k, 0)}, where n(k, t) = h\u03c8 \u2020 (k, t)\u03c8(k, t)i\nis the occupation number at time t and \u03c6(k, 0) is a\nrandom phase angle. Correlation functions, including\nn(k, t), were obtained by averaging over many trajectories. We have simulated the time evolution on a grid with\nside length L = Ns as , lattice spacing as in d = 2, 3. To\ninduce transport from small to large wave numbers, only\na few modes near k = 0 were chosen to be occupied at the\n\nFIG. 1: Phase angle \u03c6(x, t) (color scale) at four times during\na single run of the simulations in d = 2.

Such an initial state can\nbe prepared, e.g., by Bragg scattering of photons from\na Bose-Einstein condensate. During the evolution to a\nnew equilibrium state, energy is transported to modes\nwith higher wave number, and, given appropriate interaction strength, one observes quasistationary momentum\ndistributions to develop prior to final thermalisation.\nDuring the intermediate stage of the equilibration\nquantised vortices appear.\nTo exhibit the vortical\nflow\nwe\nuse\nthe\nMadelung\nrepresentation\n\u03c8(x, t) =\np\nn(x, t) exp{i\u03c6(x, t)} of the field in terms of the density n(x, t) and a phase angle \u03c6(x, t). This allows to express the particle current j = i(\u03c8 \u2217 \u2207\u03c8\u2212\u03c8\u2207\u03c8 \u2217 )/2 = nv in\nterms of the velocity field v = \u2207\u03c6. In Fig. 1 we show the\nphase angle \u03c6(x, t) during a single run in d = 2 dimensions, while in Fig. 2 the evolution in d = 3 is illustrated\nby the near-zero-density points. Many singly quantized\nvortex-antivortex pairs (vortex rings) are formed once the\ninitial coherent wave has developed to form shock-wavelike fronts. During the later evolution, the pairs mutually\nannihilate at a substantially decreasing rate. After the\nlast pair has vanished the gas thermalises. In d = 3, decreasingly tangled vortex lines are observed during the\nnear-stationary evolution. The initial conditions lead to\na dense chaotic tangle, as studied also in Refs. [21, 22].\nPower-law behaviour is found in the momentum distributions of particles and energy as we discuss in the\nfollowing. Fig. 3R shows the distribution of occupation\nnumbers n(k) = d\u03a9d n(k) over the radial momentum\nk = |k|, for the four snapshots of the two-dimensional\n\n\f3\n\nsystem depicted in Fig. 1, on a double-logarithmic scale.\n(d\u03a9d denotes the angular differential.) During the initial evolution the mode occupations gradually spread to\nlarger wave numbers. As soon as vortex-antivortex pairs\nappear, a power-law regime n(k) = k \u2212\u03b6 is observed. During the final stage of the vortex-bearing phase two distinct power laws develop which are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical prediction of Ref. [6].\nWhile in the ultraviolet the exponent \u03b6 UV = d = 2 exhibits weak wave turbulence, in the infrared the exponent\nconfirms the result \u03b6 = d + 2 = 4, see Eq. (2), corroborating results for a relativistic model in [4]. Note that in\nd = 2, the weak-turbulence exponent \u03b6 UV = 2 is identical to that in thermal equilibrium in the Rayleigh-Jeans\nregime, n(k) \u223c T /\u03c9 \u223c T /k 2 [25]. The momentum distributions during this final phase are shown again, for\nd = 2 and d = 3, in Figs. 4 and 5 (filled black circles), respectively, confirming the analytical prediction\nof Eq. (2) also for d = 3. The scaling n(k) \u223c k \u22122 in\nthe ultraviolet reflects that the corresponding modes are\nalready thermalised. We remark that, for weaker interaction strengths, the weak-wave-turbulence scaling with\n\u03b6 UV = d = 3 is also seen, at intermediate times.\nTo understand these findings in the context of QT\nwe analyse kinetic-energy spectra\nas in [13]. The toR\ntal kinetic energy Ekin = dd x h|\u2207\u03c8(x, t)|2 i/2 can be\nE\u221a\nkin = Ev + Eq , into a 'classical' part Ev =\nRsplit,\ndd x h|R nv|2 i/2 and a 'quantum-pressure' component\n\u221a\nEq = dd x h|\u2207 n|2 i/2.

[13]\nthe regularised velocity wv is furthermore decomposed\ninto 'incompressible' (divergence free) and 'compressible'\n(solenoidal) parts, wv = wi + wc , with \u2207 * wi = 0, \u2207 \u00d7\nwc = 0, to distinguish vortical superfluid and rotationless\n\n\f4\n10\n\n[1] L.

In the cases we consider, the resulting spectra ni (k), nc (k), and nq (k) add\nup to the single-particle spectrum n(k) discussed before.\nThe components and their sum are shown seperately, for\nd = 2 and d = 3, in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. Red circles denote ni , filled blue squares show the dependence\nof nc , and open grey squares that of nq . Qualitatively,\nthe results are the same for d = 2 and d = 3. Excitations with large wave numbers are thermally distributed.\nIn this regime, the spectrum n(k) \u223c k \u22122 is dominated\nby the compressible and quantum-pressure components.\nFor smaller wave numbers the scaling changes to n(k) \u223c\nk \u2212d\u22122 , being dominated by the velocity wv . Moreover,\nwe find that it is this decomposition into ni and nc which,\nfor intermediate wave numbers, allows the incompressible\npart of the energy to develop a Kolmogorov-like scaling\n\u223c k \u22125/3\u2212d\u22121 above the scale kl \u223c 2\u03c0/l determined by the\nmean distance l between vortex cores. While the scaling\nof the sum of these components is predicted by the fieldtheoretic analysis in Ref. [6], a rising compressible part\nallows the incompressible contribution to deviate from\nthe IR power law and to develop the observed scaling.\nTowards the IR limit, the compressible part becomes too\n\nweak such that the scaling of ni goes over to \u03b6 = d + 2.\nOne can show that the analytically predicted infrared\npower law n(k) \u223c k \u22124 in d = 2 is consistent with a finite\ndensity of independent vortices and antivortices. The IR\nscaling \u223c k \u2212d\u22121 of the compressible (blue) component\nsuggests an interpretation in terms of acoustic turbulence\n[20, 22, 25]. Our results show that this component survives for a limited period beyond the time when all vortical excitations have mutually annihilated. The observed\nscaling corroborates the numerical findings of Ref. [27],\nwhereby we refrain from sharing the interpretation of the\npower law.\nIn summary, our results show a distinct power-law behaviour k \u2212\u03b6 of the single-particle momentum spectrum\nn(k) as well as of different components of the kineticenergy distribution over the radial wave number k. Scaling exponents \u03b6 of n(k) corroborate the analytical predictions of Ref. [6]. Our findings suggest that local field expectation values and short- to intermediate-range coherence, including topological excitations, are at the basis of\nthe infrared power laws predicted within nonperturbative\ndynamical field theory [4\u20136, 8]. For the chosen generic\ninitial conditions, excitations on the top of this classical\nfield background support an interpretation in terms of\nacoustic wave turbulence. The connection of these phenomena with ab-initio dynamical field theoretic methods\npoints a way to unified analytical studies of turbulence.\nMoreover, it provides hints of how the proposed dynamical critical phenomena in relativistic systems [4, 5, 8] can\nbe realized in nature.\nExperimental studies of universal phenomena in\nnonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold atoms have great\npotential since universal effects do not depend significantly on initial conditions and details of the system.\nThe study of turbulence in ultracold gases may have great\nimpact on many other fields of physics. Prominent examples are strongly correlated nuclear matter produced\nin heavy-ion collisions and early-universe cosmology.\nAcknowledgements. T. G. and D. S. thank J. Berges\nand C.
