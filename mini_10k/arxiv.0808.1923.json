However, already abelian gerbes turned out to be interesting: Brylinski introduced the notion\nof a connection on an abelian gerbe, and showed that these represent classes in a certain differential\ncohomology theory, namely Deligne cohomology [Bry93]. Deligne cohomology in degree two has before\nbeen related to two-dimensional conformal field theory by Gaw\u0229dzki [Gaw88]. This relation is established by means of the surface holonomy of a connection on an abelian gerbe, which provides a term\nin the action functional of the field theory.\nSurface holonomy of connections on abelian gerbes is today well understood; see [Wal10, FNSW08]\nfor reviews. While definitions of connections on non-abelian gerbes have appeared [BM05, ACJ05], it\nremained unclear what the surface holonomy of these connections is supposed to be, how it is defined,\nand how it can be used.\nIn the present article we propose a general and systematic approach to connections on non-abelian\ngerbes, including notions of parallel transport and surface holonomy. Our approach is general in the\nsense that it works for gerbes whose band is an arbitrary Lie 2-groupoid, and whose fibres are modelled\nby an arbitrary 2-category. Our approach is systematic in the sense that it is solely based on axioms\nfor parallel transport along surfaces, formulated in terms of gluing laws and smoothness conditions.\nThe whole theory of connections on non-abelian gerbes is then derived as a consequence.\nIn order to illustrate how this axiomatic formulation works we shall briefly review a corresponding\nformulation in a more familiar setting, namely the one of connections on fibre bundles; see [SW09].\nIt shows that for a Lie group G the category of principal G-bundles with connection over a smooth\nmanifold X is equivalent to a category consisting of functors\nF : P1 (X)\n\n/ G-Tor.\n\n(1.1)\n\nThese functors are defined on the path groupoid P1 (X) of the manifold X; its objects are the points\nof X, and its morphisms are (certain classes of) paths in X. The functors (1.1) take values in the\ncategory of G-torsors, i.e. smooth manifolds with a free and transitive G-action.\nThe correspondence between principal G-bundles with connection and functors (1.1) is established\nby letting the functor F assign to points the fibres of a given bundle, and to paths the corresponding\nparallel transport maps. The gluing laws of parallel transport are precisely the axioms of a functor.\nThe smoothness conditions of parallel transport are more involved; they can be encoded in the functors\n(1.1) by requiring smooth descend data with respect to an open cover of X. Functors (1.1) with smooth\ndescend data are called transport functors with G-structure \u2013 they constitute an axiomatic formulation\nof the parallel transport of connections in G-bundles.\nIn Sections 2 and 3 of the present article we generalize this axiomatic formulation to connections on\ngerbes. Our formulation does not use any existing concept of a gerbe with connection - such concepts\nare an output of our approach. It is based on 2-functors defined on the path 2-groupoid P2 (X) of X,\nwith values in some \"target\" 2-category T ,\nF : P2 (X)\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n/ T.\n\n(1.2)\n\n\fIn Section 2.1 we review the path 2-groupoid: it is like the path groupoid but with additional 2morphisms, which are essentially fixed-end homotopies between paths.\nFor example, if T is the 2-category of algebras (over some fixed field), bimodules, and intertwiners,\na 2-functor (1.2) provides for each point x \u2208 X an algebra F (x), which is supposed to be the fibre\nof the gerbe at the point x. Further, it provides for each path \u03b3 from x to y a F (x)-F (y)-bimodule\nF (\u03b3), which is supposed to be the parallel transport of the connection on that gerbe along the curve\nparameterized by \u03b3. Finally, it provides for each homotopy \u03a3 between paths \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 an intertwiner\n/ F (\u03b3 \u2032 ),\n\nF (\u03a3) : F (\u03b3)\n\nwhich is supposed to be the parallel transport of the connection on that gerbe along the surface\nparameterized by \u03a3. The axioms of the 2-functor (1.2) describe how these parallel transport structures\nare compatible with the composition of paths and gluing of homotopies. These axioms and all other\n2-categorical structure we use can be looked up in [SW, Appendix A].\nApart from the evident generalization from functors to 2-functors, more work has to be invested into\nthe generalization of the smoothness conditions. Imposing smoothness conditions relies on a notion of\nlocal triviality for 2-functors defined on path 2-groupoids. A 2-functor\nF : P2 (X)\n\n/ T\n\n/ T , with\nis considered to be trivializable, if it factors through a prescribed 2-functor i : Gr\nGr a strict Lie 2-groupoid. The Lie 2-groupoid Gr plays the role of the \"typical fibre\", and the 2functor i indicates how the typical fibre is realized in the target 2-category T . A local trivialization\nof the 2-functor F is a cover of X by open sets U\u03b1 , a collection of locally defined \"trivial\" 2-functors\n/ Gr and of equivalences\ntriv\u03b1 : P2 (U\u03b1 )\nt\u03b1 : F |U\u03b1\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n/ i \u25e6 triv\u03b1\n\nbetween 2-functors defined on U\u03b1 . Local trivializations lead to descend data, generalizing the transition\nfunctions of a bundle. The descent data of a 2-functor with a local trivialization consists of the 2functors triv\u03b1 , of transformations\ng\u03b1\u03b2 : i \u25e6 triv\u03b1\n\n/ i \u25e6 triv\u03b2\n\nbetween 2-functors over U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 , and of higher coherence data that we shall ignore for the purposes\nof this introduction. The theory of local trivializations and descent data for 2-functors is developed in\nour paper [SW] and reviewed in Section 2.2.\nThe smoothness conditions we want to formulate are imposed with respect to descent data; they\nare the content of Section 3. First of all, we require that the 2-functors triv\u03b1 are smooth. This makes\nsense since they take values in the Lie 2-groupoid Gr. For certain Lie 2-groupoids, a theory developed\nin our paper [SW11] identifies the smooth functors triv\u03b1 with certain 2-forms B\u03b1 on U\u03b1 - the curving\nof the gerbe connection. In order to treat the transformations g\u03b1\u03b2 , we apply an observation in abstract\n2-category theory: the transformations g\u03b1\u03b2 can be regarded as a collection of functors\nF (g\u03b1\u03b2 ) : P1 (U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 )\n\n/ \u039bT ,\n\nfor \u039bT a certain category of diagrams in T . The smoothness condition that we impose for the transformation g\u03b1\u03b2 is that the functors F (g\u03b1\u03b2 ) are transport functors. According to the before-mentioned\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fcorrespondence between transport functors and fibre bundles with connection, we thus obtain a smooth\nfibre bundle F (g\u03b1\u03b2 ) with connection over two-fold overlaps U\u03b1 \u2229 U\u03b2 - a significant feature of a gerbe.\nSummarizing this overview, our axiomatic formulation of connections on gerbes consists of transport\n/ T that are locally trivializable with respect to a typical fibre\n2-functors: 2-functors F : P2 (X)\n/ T , and have smooth descent data.\ni : Gr\nIn Section 4 of this article we test our axiomatic formulation by choosing examples of target 2/ T . In these examples the Lie 2-groupoids are \"deloopings\" of\ncategories T and 2-functors i : Gr\nstrict Lie 2-groups, Gr = BG; these Lie 2-groups G play the same role for gerbes as Lie groups for\nprincipal bundles. We find the following results:\n(i) For a general Lie 2-group G and the identity 2-functor\ni = idBG : BG\n\n/ BG\n\nwe prove (Theorem 4.1.6) that there is a bijection\nh0 TransBG (X, BG) \u223c\n= \u0124 2 (X, G)\nbetween isomorphism classes of transport 2-functors and the degree two differential non-abelian\ncohomology of X with coefficients in G. These cohomology groups have been explored in [BM05]\nand [BS07]; they are an extension of Giraud's non-abelian cohomology by differential form data.\nUpon setting G = BS 1 it reduces to Deligne cohomology.\n/ S 1 -Tor to the monoidal category of S 1 (ii) The Lie 2-group BS 1 has a monoidal functor BS 1\ntorsors, by sending the single objects of BS 1 to S 1 considered as a torsor over itself. Delooping\nyields a 2-functor\n/ B(S 1 -Tor).\ni : BBS 1\nWe prove (Theorem 4.2.1) that there is an equivalence of 2-categories\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\nS\n-bundle\ngerbes\nwith\n1\n\u223c\nTransBBS 1 (X, B(S -Tor)) =\n.\nconnection over X\nBundle gerbes have been introduced by Murray [Mur96]. The equivalence arises by realizing\nthat the transport functor F (g\u03b1\u03b2 ) in the descent data corresponds in the present situation to an\nS 1 -bundle with connection.\n(iii) Let H be a Lie group and let AUT(H) be the automorphism 2-group of H. It has a monoidal\n/ H-BiTor to the monoidal category of H-bitorsors. Delooping yields a\nfunctor AUT(H)\n2-functor\n/ B(H-BiTor).\ni : BAUT(H)\nWe prove (Theorem 4.3.1) that there is an equivalence of 2-categories\n\u001a\n\u001b\nNon-abelian H-bundle gerbes\n.\nTransBAUT(H) (X, B(H-BiTor)) \u223c\n=\nwith connection over X\nNon-abelian bundle gerbes are a generalization of S 1 -bundle gerbes introduced in [ACJ05], and\nthe above equivalence arises by proving that the transport functor F (g\u03b1\u03b2 ) corresponds in the\npresent situation to a \"principal H-bibundle with twisted connection\".\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fThe relations (i) to (iii) show that all these existing concepts of gerbes with connection fit into our\naxiomatic formulation.\nApart from these relations to existing gerbes with connection, transport 2-functors are able to\ndetermine systematically new concepts in cases when only the target 2-category T and the 2-group G\nare given. We demonstrate this in Section 4.4 with the examples of connections on vector 2-bundles,\nstring 2-bundles, and principal 2-bundles.\nFinally, we discuss in Section 5 the notion of parallel transport along surfaces, which is manifestly\nincluded in the concept of a transport 2-functor. We introduce a notion of surface holonomy for\ntransport 2-functors, defined for closed oriented surfaces with a marking, i.e. a certain presentation\nof its fundamental group. It is obtained by evaluating the transport 2-functor on a homotopy that\nrealizes the single relation in this presentation.\nThe existing notion of surface holonomy for abelian gerbes takes values in S 1 [Gaw88, Mur96],\nwhile our notion of surface holonomy takes values in the 2-morphisms of the target 2-category T . In\norder to compare the two notions, we propose a \"reduction\" procedure which can be applied in the\n/ T , where G is a Lie 2-group.\ncase that typical fibre of the transport 2-functor is of the form i : BG\nThe first part of this procedure is the definition of an abelian group Gred which can be formed for\nany Lie 2-group G (Definition 5.2.2). Heuristically, it generalizes the abelianization of an ordinary Lie\ngroup. As the second part of the reduction procedure, we show (Proposition 5.2.5) that the surface\nholonomy of every transport 2-functor with BG-structure can consistently be reduced to a function\nwith values in Gred .\nOur main results in Section 5 concern this reduced surface holonomy of transport 2-functors with\nBG-structure. We prove in Theorem 5.3.2 a rigidity result for reduced surface holonomy, namely that\nit depends only on the isomorphism class of the transport 2-functor, and only on the equivalence\nclass of the marking. The isomorphism invariance allows us to transfer the reduced surface holonomy\nfrom transport 2-functors through the equivalences (i), (ii), and (iii) described above. In particular,\nwe equip non-abelian G-gerbes with a well-defined notion of a Gred -valued surface holonomy; such a\nconcept was not known before.\nFinally, we show that our new concept of reduced surface holonomy is compatible with the existing\nnotion of S 1 -valued surface holonomy of abelian gerbes. Namely, in the case G = BS 1 we find for\nthe reduction (BS 1 )red = S 1 , so that both concepts take values in the same set. We prove then in\nProposition 5.3.3 that the two concepts indeed coincide. Thus, our new notion of (reduced) surface\nholonomy consistently extends the existing notion from abelian to non-abelian gerbes.\nAcknowledgements.

The purpose of this section is to make the present paper selfcontained; we collect and review the most important definitions and results from the previous papers.\n\n2.1\n\nThe Path 2-Groupoid of a Smooth Manifold\n\nThe basic idea of the path 2-groupoid is very simple: for a smooth manifold X, it is a strict 2-category\nwhose objects are the points of X, whose 1-morphisms are smooth paths in X, and whose 2-morphisms\nare smooth homotopies between these paths. We recall some definitions from [SW09, SW11].\n/ X with \u03b3(0) = x and\n/ y is a smooth map \u03b3 : [0, 1]\nFor points x, y \u2208 X, a path \u03b3 : x\n/\n/ z should again\n\u03b3(1) = y. Since the composition \u03b32 \u25e6 \u03b31 of two paths \u03b31 : x\ny and \u03b32 : y\nbe a smooth map we require sitting instants for all paths: a number 0 < \u01eb < 12 with \u03b3(t) = \u03b3(0) for\n0 \u2264 t < \u01eb and \u03b3(t) = \u03b3(1) for 1 \u2212 \u01eb < t \u2264 1. The set of these paths is denoted by P X. In order to\nmake the composition associative and to make paths invertible, we consider the following equivalence\n/ y are called thin homotopy equivalent if there exists a smooth\nrelation on P X: two paths \u03b3, \u03b3 \u2032 : x\n2\n/\nmap h : [0, 1]\nX such that\n(1) h is a homotopy from \u03b3 to \u03b3 \u2032 through paths x\n\n/ y and has sitting instants at \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 .\n\n(2) the differential of h has at most rank 1.\nThe set of equivalence classes is denoted by P 1 X. We remark that any path \u03b3 is thin homotopy\nequivalent to any orientation-preserving reparameterization of \u03b3. The composition of paths induces a\nwell-defined associative composition on P 1 X for which the constant paths idx are identities and the\nreversed paths \u03b3 \u22121 are inverses; see [SW09, Section 2.1] for more details.\nA homotopy h between two paths \u03b30 and \u03b31 like above but without condition (2) on the rank of its\n+3 \u03b31 . These bigons form the 2-morphisms\ndifferential is called a bigon in X and denoted by \u03a3 : \u03b30\nof the path 2-groupoid of X. We denote the set of bigons in X by BX. Bigons can be composed in\n+3 \u03b33 we have a vertical composition\n+3 \u03b32 and \u03a3\u2032 : \u03b32\ntwo natural ways.

We denote the set of equivalence classes by B 2 X.\nThe two compositions \u25e6 and \u2022 between bigons induce a well-defined composition on B 2 X. The path\n2-groupoid P2 (X) is the 2-category whose set of objects is X, whose set of 1-morphisms is P 1 X and\nwhose set of 2-morphisms is B 2 X. The path 2-groupoid is strict and all 1-morphisms are strictly\ninvertible. We refer the reader to [SW11, Section 2.1] for a detailed discussion.\nIn this article we describe connections on gerbes by transport 2-functors \u2013 certain (not necessarily\nstrict) 2-functors\n/ T,\nF : P2 (X)\nfor some 2-category T , the target 2-category. We note that 2-functors can be pulled back along smooth\n/ X: such a map induces a strict 2-functor f\u2217 : P2 (M )\n/ P2 (X), and we write\nmaps f : M\nf \u2217 F := F \u25e6 f\u2217 .\nIf we drop condition (3) from the definition of thin homotopy equivalence between bigons we\nwould still get a strict 2-groupoid, which we denote by \u03a02 (X) and which we call the fundamental\n/ \u03a02 (X). We say that a 2-functor\n2-groupoid of X. The projection defines a strict 2-functor P2 (X)\n/ \u03a02 (M ). We show in Section\n/ T is flat if it factors through the 2-functor P2 (M )\nF : P2 (M )\n3.4 that this abstract notion of flatness is equivalent to the vanishing of a certain curvature 3-form.\n\n2.2\n\nLocal Trivializations and Descent Data\n\nLet T be a 2-category. A key feature of a transport 2-functor is that it is locally trivializable. Local\n/ T are defined with respect to three attributes:\ntrivializations of a 2-functor F : P2 (M )\n1. A strict 2-groupoid Gr, the structure 2-groupoid . In Section 2.3 we will require that Gr is a Lie\n2-groupoid, and formulate smoothness conditions with respect to its smooth structure.\n2.

An example is an open cover U = {U\u03b1 } of M , for which the disjoint union of all open sets U\u03b1\ntogether with the projection to M is a surjective submersion. In this example, the k-fold fibre product\nis the disjoint union of the k-fold intersections of the open sets U\u03b1 .\nDefinition 2.2.1.

According to the\nconventions we fixed there, it includes a weak inverse t\u0304 together with modifications\nit : t\u0304 \u25e6 t\n\n+3 id\u03c0\u2217 F\n\nand\n\njt : idtrivi\n\n+3 t \u25e6 t\u0304\n\n(2.2.1)\n\nsatisfying the so-called zigzag identities.\nIn the following we use the abbreviation trivi := i \u25e6 triv, and we write Triv2\u03c0 (i) for the 2-category\n/ T with \u03c0-local i-trivializations (together with all pseudonatural transof 2-functors F : P2 (M )\nformations and all modifications). Next we come to the definition of a 2-category Des2\u03c0 (i) of descent\n/ T.\n/ M and a structure 2-groupoid i : Gr\ndata with respect to a surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\nDefinition 2.2.2.

To compare the difference between triv\u03b1 and triv\u03b2 on a\nare strict 2-functors triv\u03b1 : P2 (U\u03b1 )\n/ (triv\u03b2 )i .

In\nthe present situation, however, these equalities have been replaced by modifications: the first one by\n+3 g\u03b1\u03b3 .\n+3 g\u03b1\u03b1 and the second one by a modification f\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 : g\u03b2\u03b3 \u25e6 g\u03b1\u03b2\na modification \u03c8\u03b1 : id(triv\u03b1 )i\nNext we describe how to extract a descend object from a local trivialization of a 2-functor following\n/ T be a 2-functor with a \u03c0-local i-trivialization (triv, t). Using\n[SW, Section 2.3].

We\n+3 \u2206\u2217 g.\nobtain \u2206\u2217 g = t \u25e6 t\u0304, so that the definition \u03c8 := jt yields the invertible modification \u03c8 : idtrivi\nSimilarly, one defines with it the invertible modification f . The quadruple (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) obtained like\nthis is a descend object in the sense of Definition 2.2.2; see [SW, Lemma 2.3.1].\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fNext suppose (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) and (triv\u2032 , g \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 ) are descent objects. A descent 1-morphism\n/ (triv\u2032 , g \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 ) is a pair (h, \u01eb) consisting of a pseudonatural transformation\n(triv, g, \u03c8, f )\nh : trivi\n\n/ triv\u2032i\n\nand an invertible modification\n\u01eb : \u03c02\u2217 h \u25e6 g\n\n+3 g \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u2217 h\n1\n\nsatisfying two natural coherence conditions; see [SW, Definition 2.2.2]. Finally, we suppose that\n(h1 , \u01eb1 ) and (h2 , \u01eb2 ) are descent 1-morphisms from a descent object (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) to another descent\n+3 (h2 , \u01eb2 ) is a modification\nobject (triv\u2032 , g \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 ).

In concrete examples of the target 2-category T these structures have natural interpretations\nin terms of smooth maps and differential forms, as we show in Section 4. The extraction of a descent\nobject from a local trivialization outlined above extends to a 2-functor\nEx\u03c0 : Triv2\u03c0 (i)\n\n/ Des2\u03c0 (i),\n\n(2.2.2)\n\nwhich we have described in [SW, Section 2.3].\n/ M , we have shown in\nIn order to avoid the dependence to the fixed surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\n2\n2\n[SW, Section 4.2] that the two 2-categories Triv\u03c0 (i) and Des\u03c0 (i) form a direct system for refinements\nof surjective submersions over M . The corresponding direct limits are 2-categories\nTriv2 (i)M := lim\nTriv2\u03c0 (i)\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nand\n\nDes2 (i)M := lim\nDes2\u03c0 (i).\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nFor instance, an object in the direct limit is a pair of a surjective submersion \u03c0 and an object in the\ncorresponding 2-category Triv2\u03c0 (i) or Des2\u03c0 (i). 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms are defined over common\nrefinements. The 2-functor Ex\u03c0 from (2.2.2) induces an equivalence\nTriv2 (i)M \u223c\n= Des2 (i)M\nbetween these two direct limit 2-categories [SW, Proposition 4.2.1].\nFinally, we want to get rid of the chosen trivializations that are attached to the objects of Triv2 (i)M .\nWe denote by Functi (P2 (M ), T ) the 2-category of locally i-trivializable 2-functors, i.e. 2-functors which\nadmit a \u03c0-local i-trivialization, for some surjective submersion \u03c0. We have shown [SW, Theorem 4.3.1]:\nTheorem 2.2.3. There is an equivalence\nFuncti (P2 (M ), T ) \u223c\n= Des2 (i)M\nbetween 2-categories of locally i-trivializable 2-functors and their descend data.\nIn Section 3 we select a sub-2-category of Des2 (i)M consisting of smooth descend data. The corresponding sub-2-category of Functi (P2 (M ), T ) is the one we are aiming at \u2013 the 2-category of transport\n2-functors.\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\f2.3\n\nSmooth 2-Functors\n\nThis section and the forthcoming Section 2.4 prepare two tools we need in Section 3.1 in order to\nspecify the sub-2-category of smooth descend data. The first tool is the concept of smooth 2-functors.\nThe general idea behind \"smooth functors\" is to consider them internal to smooth manifolds. That\nis, the sets of objects and morphisms of the involved categories are smooth manifolds, and a smooth\nfunctor consists of a smooth map between the objects and a smooth map between the morphisms.\nCategories internal to smooth manifolds are called Lie categories, internal groupoids are called Lie\ngroupoids. The same idea applies to 2-functors between 2 -categories.\nIn the context of the present paper, we want to consider smooth 2-functors defined on the path\n2-groupoid P2 (X) of a smooth manifold X, respectively. However, P2 (X) is not internal to smooth\nmanifolds, not even infinite-dimensional ones. Instead, we consider it internal to a larger category\nof generalized manifolds, so-called diffeological spaces [Sou81]. Diffeological spaces and diffeological\nmaps form a category D\u221e that enlarges the category C \u221e of smooth manifolds by means of a full and\n/ D\u221e . For an introduction to diffeological spaces we refer the reader to [BH11]\nfaithful functor C \u221e\nor [SW09, Appendix A.2].\nDiffeological spaces admit many constructions that are not possible in the category of smooth\nmanifolds. We need three of them. Firstly, if X and Y are diffeological spaces, the set D\u221e (X, Y )\nof smooth maps from X to Y is again a diffeological space. In particular, the set of smooth maps\nbetween smooth manifolds is a diffeological space. Secondly, every subset of a diffeological space is\na diffeological space. Thirdly, the quotient of every diffeological space by any equivalence relation is\na diffeological space. These constructions are relevant because they show that the set P 1 X of thin\nhomotopy classes of paths in X as well as the set B 2 X of thin homotopy classes of bigons in X are\ndiffeological spaces. We conclude that the path 2-groupoid P2 (X) of a smooth manifold X is internal\nto diffeological spaces, and we have a corresponding 2-category Funct\u221e (P2 (X), S) of smooth 2-functors\nwith values in some Lie 2-category S.\n\n2.4\n\nTransport Functors\n\nThe second tool we need for Section 3 is the concept of a transport functor. Transport functors are\nan axiomatic formulation of connections in fibre bundles \u2013 they are the one-dimensional analogue of\ntransport 2-functors, the axiomatic formulation of connections on non-abelian gerbes we are aiming at\nin the present article. We have introduced and discussed transport functors in [SW09].\nFrom a general perspective, the definition of a \"transport n-functor\" is supposed to rely on a\nrecursive principle in the sense that it uses transport (n \u2212 1)-functors. This is one reason to recall\nthe definition of a transport functor. The other reason is to highlight the analogy between the two\ndefinitions, which might be helpful to notice:\n(a) Instead of the path 2-groupoid P2 (X), we are looking at the path groupoid P1 (X), obtained by\njust taking objects and 1-morphisms of P2 (X). A transport functor is a certain functor\nF : P1 (X)\n\n/ T,\n\nfor some target category T : it assigns objects in T \u2013 the \"fibres\" \u2013 to the points of X, and\nmorphisms in T \u2013 the \"parallel transport maps\" \u2013 to paths in X.\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\f(b) In order to say which functors are transport functors we need a Lie groupoid Gr and a functor\n/ X, a functor\n/ T . A local i-trivialization of F is a surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\ni : Gr\n/\nGr, and a natural equivalence\ntriv : P1 (Y )\nP1 (Y )\n\n\u03c0\u2217\n\ntt t\n\u000f v~ tttttt\nGr\n\ntriv\n\n/ P1 (X)\nt\nttttt\nF\n\n\u000f\n/ T.\n\ni\n\n(c) Associated to a local trivialization is a descent object : it is a pair (triv, g) consisting of the functor\n/ Gr and of a natural equivalence\ntriv : P1 (Y )\ng : \u03c01\u2217 trivi\n\n/ \u03c02\u2217 trivi\n\nsatisfying a cocycle condition.\nThe final step in the definition of a transport functor is the characterization of smooth descent data.\n(d) A descent object (triv, g) is called smooth, if the functor\n/ Gr\n\ntriv : P1 (X)\n\nis smooth, i.e. internal to diffeological spaces, and if the components map\ng : Y [2]\n\n/ Mor(T )\n\nof the natural equivalence g is the composition of a smooth map g\u0303 : Y [2]\n/ T.\ni : Gr\n\n/ Mor(Gr) with\n\nIn view of the analogy between (a) - (c) and Sections 2.1 and 2.2, (d) is the analogue of the forthcoming\nSection 3.1. Summarizing, we have:\nDefinition 2.4.1 ([SW09, Definition 3.6]). A transport functor on X with values in T and with\nGr-structure is a locally i-trivializable functor\nF : P1 (X)\n\n/ T\n\nwith smooth descent data.\nTransport functors form a category which we denote by Trans1Gr (X, T ). The main result of our\npaper [SW09] is that transport functors are an axiomatic formulation of connection on fibre bundles.\nIn order to illustrate that, and since we need this result later several times, we provide the following\nexample. let G be a Lie group, and let Bun\u2207\nG (X) be the category of principal G-bundles with connection\nover X. Further, we denote by BG the Lie groupoid with one object and morphisms G, by G-Tor the\n/ G-Tor the functor that sends the single object of BG to G,\ncategory of G-torsors, and by i : BG\nregarded as a G-torsor over itself. Then, we have:\nTheorem 2.4.2 ([SW09, Theorem 5.8]).\nBun\u2207\nG (X)\n\nLet X be a smooth manifold. The assignment\n/ Trans1BG (X, G-Tor) : (P, \u03c9) \u2724 / FP,\u03c9\n\ndefined by\nFP,\u03c9 (x) := Px\n\nand\n\nFP,\u03c9 (\u03b3) := \u03c4\u03b3 ,\n\nwhere x \u2208 X, \u03b3 \u2208 P X, and \u03c4\u03b3 is the parallel transport of \u03c9 along \u03b3, establishes a surjective equivalence\nof categories.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\f3\n\nTransport 2-Functors\n\nIn this section we introduce the central definition of this paper: transport 2-functors. For this purpose,\nwe define in Section 3.1 a 2-category of smooth descent data, based on the notions of smooth 2functors and transport functors. In Section 3.2 we define transport 2-functors as those 2-functors that\ncorrespond to smooth descent data under the equivalence of Theorem 2.2.3. Section 3.3 describes some\nbasic properties of transport 2-functors, and in Section 3.4 we construct an explicit example.\n\n3.1\n\nSmooth Descent Data\n\nIn this section we select a sub-2-category Des2\u03c0 (i)\u221e of smooth descent data in the 2-category Des2\u03c0 (i)\nof descent data described in Section 2.2. If (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) is a descent object, we demand that the strict\n/ Gr has to be smooth in the sense of Section 2.3, i.e. internal to diffeological\n2-functor triv : P2 (Y )\nspaces. Imposing smoothness conditions for the pseudonatural transformation g and the modifications\n\u03c8 and f is more subtle since they do not take values in the Lie 2-category Gr but in the 2-category T\nwhich is not assumed to be a Lie 2-category.\nBriefly, we proceed in the following two steps. We explain first how the pseudonatural transformation\n/ \u03c02\u2217 trivi\ng : \u03c01\u2217 trivi\ncan be viewed as a certain functor F (g) defined on P1 (Y [2] ). Secondly, we impose the condition that\nF (g) is a transport functor. A little motivation might be the observation that F (g) corresponds then\n(at least in some cases, by Theorem 2.4.2) to a principal bundle with connection over Y [2] \u2013 one of the\nwell-known ingredients of a (bundle) gerbe, see Sections 4.2 and 4.3.\nLet us first explain in general how a pseudonatural transformation between two 2-functors can\nbe viewed as a functor. We consider 2-functors F and G between 2-categories S and T . Since a\n/ G assigns 1-morphisms in T to objects in S and 2-morphisms\npseudonatural transformation \u03c1 : F\nin T to 1-morphisms in S, the general idea is to construct a category S0,1 consisting of objects and\n1-morphisms of S and a category \u039bT consisting of 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms of T such that \u03c1\nyields a functor\n/ \u039bT .\nF (\u03c1) : S0,1\nWe assume that S is strict, so that forgetting its 2-morphisms produces a well-defined category S0,1 .\nThe construction of the category \u039bT is more involved.\nIf T is strict, the objects of \u039bT are the 1-morphisms of T . A morphism between objects\n/ Yg is a pair of 1-morphisms x : Xf\n/ Xg and y : Yf\n/ Yg\n/ Yf and g : Xg\nf : Xf\nand a 2-morphism\nx /\nXf\nXg\n5\n5\n5\n55 g\n\u03c65\nf\n(3.1.1)\n5555\n5\n5\n\u000f\n\u000f z\u0002\n/ Yg .\nYf\ny\nThis gives indeed a category \u039bT , whose composition is defined by putting the diagrams (3.1.1) next\n/ T induces a functor \u039bf : \u039bT \u2032\n/ \u039bT . For a\nto each other. Clearly, any strict 2-functor f : T \u2032\nmore detailed discussion of these constructions we refer the reader to Section 4.2 of [SW11].\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f/ G be a pseudonatural transformation between two strict 2-functors from S\nNow let \u03c1 : F\nto T . Sending an object X in S to the 1-morphism \u03c1(X) and sending a 1-morphism f in S to the\n2-morphism \u03c1(X) now yields a functor\n/ \u039bT .\n\nF (\u03c1) : S0,1\n\nIt respects the composition due to axiom (T1) for \u03c1 and the identities due to [SW, Lemma A.7].\n3+ \u03c12 defines a natural transformation F (A) : F (\u03c11 )\n+3 F (\u03c12 ),\nMoreover, a modification A : \u03c11\nso that the result is a functor\nF : Hom(F, G)\n\n/ Funct(S0,1 , \u039bT )\n\n(3.1.2)\n\nbetween the category of pseudonatural transformations between F and G and the category of functors\nfrom S0,1 to \u039bT , for S and T strict 2-categories and F and G strict 2-functors.\nIn case that the 2-category T is not strict, the construction of \u039bT suffers from the fact that the\ncomposition is not longer associative. The situation becomes treatable if one requires the objects Xf , Yf\nand Xg , Yg and the 1-morphisms x and y in (3.1.1) to be contained the image of a strict 2-category\n/ T .

Here, c is the compositor of the 2-functor i.\nof the composition is restored by axiom (F3) on the compositor of the 2-functor i. We omit a more\n/ T \u2032,\nformal definition and refer the reader to Figure 1 for an illustration. For any 2-functor f : T\na functor\n/ \u039bF \u25e6i T \u2032\n\u039bF : \u039bi T\nis induced by applying f to all involved objects, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms. We may now consider\nstrict 2-functors F and G from S to T str . Then, the functor (3.1.2) generalizes straightforwardly to a\nfunctor\n/ Funct(S0,1 , \u039bi T )\nF : Hom(i \u25e6 F, i \u25e6 G)\nbetween the category of pseudonatural transformations between i \u25e6 F and i \u25e6 G and the category of\nfunctors from S0,1 to \u039bi T . The following lemma follows directly from the definitions.\nLemma 3.1.1. The functor F has the following properties:\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\f(i) It is natural with respect to strict 2-functors f : S \u2032\n\n/ S in the sense that the diagram\n\nF\n\nHom(i \u25e6 F, i \u25e6 G)\n\n/ Funct(S0,1 , \u039bi T )\nf\u2217\n\nf\u2217\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\nHom(i \u25e6 F \u25e6 f, i \u25e6 G \u25e6 f )\n\nF\n\n\u2032\n/ Funct(S0,1\n, \u039bi T )\n\nis strictly commutative.\n(ii) It preserves the composition of pseudonatural transformations in the sense that if\n/ T str are three strict 2-functors, the diagram\nF, G, H : S\nHom(i\u25e6G, i\u25e6H) \u00d7Hom(i\u25e6F, i\u25e6G)\n\nF \u00d7F\n\n/ Funct(S0,1 , \u039bi T ) \u00d7Funct(S0,1 , \u039bi T )\n\n\u25e6\n\n\u2297\n\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\nHom(i \u25e6 H, i \u25e6 F )\n\n/ Funct(S0,1 , \u039bi T )\n\nF\n\nis commutative.\nIn Lemma 3.1.1 (ii) the symbol \u2297 has the following meaning. The composition of morphisms in\n\u039bi T was defined by putting the diagrams (3.1.1) next to each other as shown in Figure 1. But one can\nalso put the diagrams of appropriate morphisms on top of each other, provided that the arrow on the\nbottom of the upper one coincides with the arrow on the top of the lower one. This is indeed the case\nfor the morphisms in the image of composable pseudonatural transformations under F \u00d7 F , so that\nthe diagram in (ii) makes sense. In a more formal context, the tensor product \u2297 can be discussed in\nthe formalism of weak double categories, but we will not stress this point.\nIn the following discussion the strict 2-category S is the path 2-groupoid of some smooth manifold,\nS = P2 (X). Notice that S0,1 = P1 (X) is then the path groupoid of X. The 2-category T is the target\n2-category, and the strict 2-category T str is the Lie 2-groupoid Gr.\nLet (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) be a descent object in the descent 2-category Des2\u03c0 (i). The pseudonatural trans/ \u03c02\u2217 trivi induces a functor\nformation g : \u03c01\u2217 trivi\nF (g) : P1 (Y [2] )\n\n/ \u039bi T .\n\nIn order to impose the condition that F (g) is a transport functor, we will use the functor\n\u039bi : \u039bGr\n\n/ \u039bi T\n\nas its structure Lie groupoid. Further, the modification \u03c8 : idtrivi\n(i) a natural transformation\n+3 \u2206\u2217 F (g).\nF (\u03c8) : F (idtrivi )\n\n/ \u2206\u2217 g induces via Lemma 3.1.1\n\nFinally, the modification f induces via Lemma 3.1.1 (i) and (ii) a natural transformation\n\u2217\n\u2217\nF (f ) : \u03c023\nF (g) \u2297 \u03c012\nF (g)\n\n+3 \u03c0 \u2217 F (g).\n13\n\nDefinition 3.1.2. A descent object (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) is called smooth if the following conditions are satisfied:\n(i) the 2-functor triv : P2 (Y )\n\n/ Gr is smooth.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f(ii) the functor F (g) is a transport functor with \u039bGr-structure.\n(iii) the natural transformations F (\u03c8) and F (f ) are morphisms between transport functors.\nIn the same way we qualify smooth descent 1-morphisms and descent 2-morphisms. A descent\n1-morphism\n/ (triv\u2032 , g \u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 )\n(h, \u01eb) : (triv, g, \u03c8, f )\nis converted into a functor\n/ \u039bi T\n\nF (h) : P1 (Y )\nand a natural transformation\nF (\u01eb) : \u03c02\u2217 F (h) \u2297 F (g)\n\n+3 F (g \u2032 ) \u2297 \u03c01\u2217 F (h).\n\nWe say that (h, \u01eb) is smooth, if F (h) is a transport functor with \u039bGr-structure and F (\u01eb) is a 1+3 (h\u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 ) is converted into a\nmorphism between transport functors. A descent 2-morphism E : (h, \u01eb)\nnatural transformation\n+3 F (h\u2032 ),\nF (E) : F (h)\nand we say that E is smooth, if F (E) is a 1-morphism between transport functors. We claim two\nobvious properties of smooth descent data:\n(i) Compositions of smooth descent 1-morphisms and smooth descent 2-morphisms are again smooth,\nso that smooth descent data forms a sub-2-category of Des2\u03c0 (i), which we denote by Des2\u03c0 (i)\u221e .\n(ii) Pullbacks of smooth descend objects, 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms along refinements of surjective submersions are again smooth, so that the direct limit\nDes2 (i)\u221e\nDes2\u03c0 (i)\u221e\nM := lim\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nis a well-defined sub-2-category of Des2 (i)M .\nIn Section 4 we show that the 2-category Des2 (i)\u221e\nM of smooth descent data becomes nice and familiar\n/ T.\nupon choosing concrete examples for the structure 2-groupoid i : Gr\n\n3.2\n\nTransport 2-Functors\n\nNow we come to the central definition of this paper.\nDefinition 3.2.1. Let M be a smooth manifold, Gr be a strict Lie 2-groupoid, T be a 2-category and\n/ T be a 2-functor. A transport 2-functor on M with values in T and with Gr-structure is a\ni : Gr\n2-functor\n/ T\ntra : P2 (M )\nsuch that there exists a surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\ndescent object Ex\u03c0 (tra, triv, t) is smooth.\n\n/ M and a \u03c0-local i-trivialization (triv, t) whose\n\nA 1-morphism between transport 2-functors tra and tra\u2032 is a pseudonatural transformation\n/ tra\u2032 such that there exists a surjective submersion \u03c0 together with \u03c0-local i-trivializations\nA : tra\nof tra and tra\u2032 for which the descent 1-morphism Ex\u03c0 (A) is smooth. 2-morphisms are defined in the\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\f/ T with Gr-structure, 1-morphisms, and 2-morphisms\nsame way. Transport 2-functors tra : P2 (M )\nform a sub-2-category of the 2-category of locally i-trivializable 2-functor Functi (P2 (M ), T ), and we\ndenote this sub-2-category by Trans2Gr (M, T ). We emphasize that being a transport 2-functor is a\nproperty, not additional structure. In particular, no surjective submersion or open cover is contained\nin the structure of a transport 2-functor: they are manifestly globally defined objects.\nWe want to establish an equivalence between transport 2-functors and their smooth descent data.\nIn order to achieve this equivalence we have to make a slight assumption on the 2-functor i. We call a\n/ T full and faithful , if it induces an equivalence on Hom-categories. In particular,\n2-functor i : Gr\ni is full and faithful if it is an equivalence of 2-categories, which is in fact true in all examples we are\ngoing to discuss.\n/ T be a full and faithful 2-functor.\nTheorem 3.2.2. Let M be a smooth manifold, and let i : Gr\nThen, the equivalence of Theorem 2.2.3 restricts to an equivalence\nTrans2Gr (M, T ) \u223c\n= Des2 (i)\u221e\nM\nbetween transport 2-functors and their smooth descent data.\nTheorem 3.2.2 is proved by the following two lemmata. As an intermediate step we introduce \u2013\nfor a surjective submersion \u03c0 \u2013 the sub-2-category Triv2\u03c0 (i)\u221e of Triv2\u03c0 (i) as the preimage of Des2\u03c0 (i)\u221e\nunder the 2-functor Ex\u03c0 .\nLemma 3.2.3. The 2-functor Ex\u03c0 restricts to an equivalence of 2-categories\nTriv2\u03c0 (i)\u221e \u223c\n= Des2\u03c0 (i)\u221e .\nProof. It is clear that Ex\u03c0 restricts properly. Recall from [SW, Section 3] that inverse to Ex\u03c0 is\na \"reconstruction\" 2-functor Rec\u03c0 . In order to prove that the image of the restriction of Rec\u03c0 is\ncontained in Triv2\u03c0 (i)\u221e we have to check that Ex\u03c0 \u25e6 Rec\u03c0 restricts to an endo-2-functor of Des2\u03c0 (i)\u221e .\nIn the proof of [SW, Lemma 4.1.2] we have explicitly computed this 2-functor, and by inspection of\nthe corresponding expressions one recognizes its image as smooth descent data.\nThe second part of the proof is to show that the components of two pseudonatural equivalences\n/ id and \u03b7 : id\n/ Rec\u03c0 \u25e6 Ex\u03c0 that establish the equivalence of [SW, Proposition\n\u03c1 : Ex\u03c0 \u25e6 Rec\u03c0\n4.1.1] are in Des2\u03c0 (i)\u221e and Triv2\u03c0 (i)\u221e , respectively. For the transformation \u03c1, this is again by inspection\nof the formulae in the proof of [SW, Lemma 4.1.2]. For the transformation \u03b7, we suppose F is a 2functor with a \u03c0-local i-trivialization (t, triv) with smooth descent data (triv, g, \u03c8, f ). We have to\nprove that the descent 1-morphism Ex\u03c0 (\u03b7(F, t, triv)) is smooth. Indeed, according to the definition of\n\u03b7 given in the proof of [SW, Lemma 4.1.3] it is given by the pseudonatural transformation g and a\nmodification composed from the modifications f and \u03c8. The descent object is by assumption smooth,\nand so is \u03b7(F ). The same argument shows that the component \u03b7(A) of a pseudonatural transformation\n/ F \u2032 with smooth descent data is smooth.\nA:F\n\u0003\nNext we go to the direct limit\nTriv2 (i)\u221e\nTriv2\u03c0 (i)\u221e .\nM := lim\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nThe equivalence of Lemma 3.2.3 induces an equivalence\nEx : Triv2 (i)\u221e\nM\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n/ Des2 (i)\u221e\n\u03c0\n\n\f2\nin the direct limit. Next we show that the 2-categories Triv2 (i)\u221e\nM and TransGr (M, T ) are equivalent.\nWe have an evident 2-functor\n\nv \u221e : Triv2 (i)\u221e\nM\n\n/ Trans2 (X, T )\nGr\n\ninduced by forgetting the chosen trivialization.\nLemma 3.2.4. Under the assumption that the 2-functor i is full and faithful, the 2-functor v \u221e is an\nequivalence of 2-categories.\nProof. It is clear that an inverse functor w\u221e takes a given transport 2-functor and picks some\n/ M . It follows immediately that\nsmooth local trivialization for some surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\n\u221e\n\u221e\nv \u25e6 w = id. It remains to construct a pseudonatural equivalence id \u223c\n= w\u221e \u25e6 v \u221e , i.e. a 1-isomorphism\n/ (tra, \u03c0 \u2032 , triv\u2032 , t\u2032 )\n\nA : (tra, \u03c0, triv, t)\n\nin Triv2 (i)\u221e\nM , where the original \u03c0-local trivialization (triv, t) has been forgotten and replaced by a\nnew \u03c0 \u2032 -local trivialization (triv\u2032 , t\u2032 ). But since the 1-morphisms in Triv2 (i)\u221e\nM are just pseudonatural\ntransformation between the 2-functors ignoring the trivializations, we only have to prove that the\nidentity pseudonatural transformation\nA := idtra : tra\n\n/ tra\n\nof a transport 2-functor tra has smooth descent data (h, \u01eb) with respect to any two trivializations\n(\u03c0, triv, t) and (\u03c0 \u2032 , triv\u2032 , t\u2032 ).\n/ Y \u00d7M Y \u2032 of the common refinement of the\nThe first step is to choose a refinement \u03b6 : Z\nto surjective submersions.

In Section 4 we will identify smooth descent data\nwith various models of gerbes with connections. Under this identifications, Theorem 3.2.2 describes\nthe relation between these gerbes with connections and their parallel transport.\n\n3.3\n\nSome Features of Transport 2-Functors\n\nIn this section we provide several features of transport 2-functors.\n3.3.1\n\nOperations on Transport 2-Functors\n\nIt is straightforward to see that transport 2-functors allow a list of natural operations.\n/ N be a smooth map. The pullback f \u2217 tra of any transport 2-functor\n(i) Pullbacks: Let f : M\non N is a transport 2-functor on M .\n/ T be a monoidal structure on a 2-category T .

Then, tra is also a transport 2-functor with Gr\u2032 -structure,\nsince for any local i-trivialization (triv, t) of tra we have a local i\u2032 -trivialization (F \u25e6 triv, t).\n3.3.2\n\nStructure Lie 2-Groups\n\nWe describe some examples of Lie 2-groupoids and outline the role of the corresponding transport\n2-functors. First we recall the following generalization of a Lie group.\nDefinition 3.3.1. A Lie 2-group is a strict monoidal Lie category (G, \u22a0, I) together with a smooth\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\ffunctor inv : G\n\n/ G such that\n\nX \u22a0 inv(X) = I = inv(X) \u22a0 X\n\nand\n\nf \u22a0 inv(f ) = idI = inv(f ) \u22a0 f\n\nfor all objects X and all morphisms f in G.\nThe strict monoidal category (G, \u22a0, I) defines a strict 2-category BG with a single object [SW,\nExample A.2]. The additional functor inv assures that BG is a strict 2-groupoid . All our examples in\nSection 4 discuss transport 2-functors with BG-structure, for G a Lie 2-group.\nLie 2-groups can be obtained from the following structure.\nDefinition 3.3.2. A smooth crossed module is a quadruple (G, H, t, \u03b1) of Lie groups G and H, of a\n/ H by Lie group\n/ G, and of a smooth left action \u03b1 : G \u00d7 H\nLie group homomorphism t : H\nhomomorphisms such that\na) t(\u03b1(g, h)) = gt(h)g \u22121 for all g \u2208 G and h \u2208 H.\nb) \u03b1(t(h), x) = hxh\u22121 for all h, x \u2208 H.\nThe construction of a Lie 2-group G = G(G, H, t, \u03b1) from a given smooth crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1)\ncan be found in the Appendix of [SW11]. We shall explicitly describe the corresponding Lie 2-groupoid\nBG. It has one object denoted \u2217 . A 1-morphism is a group element g \u2208 G, the identity 1-morphism\nis the neutral element, and the composition of 1-morphisms is the multiplication, g2 \u25e6 g1 := g2 g1 . The\n2-morphisms are pairs (g, h) \u2208 G \u00d7 H, considered as 2-morphisms\ng\n\n\u2217\n\nh\n\n\u001b\nC\u2217\n\n\u0013\n\ng\u2032\n\nwith g \u2032 := t(h)g.

A smooth crossed module is defined by G = {1} and H := A.\nThis fixes the maps to t(a) := 1 and \u03b1(1, a) := a. Notice that axiom b) is satisfied because A is\nabelian. The associated Lie 2-group is denoted by BA. Transport 2-functors with BBA-structure\nplay the role of abelian gerbes with connection; see Section 4.2.\n(ii) Let G be a Lie group. A smooth crossed module is defined by H := G, t = id and \u03b1(g, h) := ghg \u22121 .\nThe associated Lie 2-group is denoted by EG. This notation is devoted to the fact that the\ngeometric realization of the nerve of the category EG yields the universal G-bundle EG. Transport\n2-functors with BEG-structure arise as the curvature of transport functors; see Section 3.4.\n(iii) Let H be a connected Lie group, so that the group of Lie group automorphisms of H is again a\nLie group G := Aut(H). The definitions t(h)(x) := hxh\u22121 and \u03b1(\u03c6, h) := \u03c6(h) yield a smooth\ncrossed module whose associated Lie 2-group is denoted by AUT(H), it is called the automorphism\n2-group of H. Transport 2-functors with BAUT(H)-structure play the role non-abelian gerbes\nwith connection; see Section 4.3.\n(iv) Let\n/N\n\n1\n\nt\n\n/H\n\np\n\n/G\n\n/1\n\nbe an exact sequence of Lie groups, not necessarily central. There is a canonical action \u03b1 of H\non N defined by requiring\nt(\u03b1(h, n)) = ht(n)h\u22121 .\nThis defines a smooth crossed module, whose associated Lie 2-group we denote by N. Transport\n2-functors with BN-structure correspond to (non-abelian) lifting gerbes. They generalize the\nabelian lifting gerbes [Bry93, Mur96] for central extensions to arbitrary short exact sequences of\nLie groups.\n3.3.3\n\nTransgression to Loop Spaces\n\nTransport 2-functors on a smooth manifold M induce interesting structure on the loop space LM .\nThis comes from the fact that there is a canonical smooth functor\nl : P1 (LM )\n\n/ \u039bP2 (M )\n\nexpressing that a point in LM is just a particular path in M , and that a path in LM is just a particular\n/ T is a transport 2-functor, then the composition\nbigon in M [SW11, Section 4.2].

If g : \u03c01\u2217 trivi\ntural transformation in the smooth descent object Ex\u03c0 (tra, t, triv), and g\u0303 is the natural transformation\nin the descent object Ex\u03c0 (Ttra , t\u0303, l\u2217 \u039btriv) associated to the above trivialization, we find g\u0303 = l\u2217 \u039bg.\nSince F (g) is a transport 2-functor with \u039bGr-structure, it has smooth Wilson lines [SW09]: for a\n/ \u03c02\u2217 l\u2217 \u039btriv with\nfixed point \u03b1 \u2208 Y [2] there exists a smooth natural transformation g \u2032 : \u03c01\u2217 l\u2217 \u039btriv\ng = i(g \u2032 ). This shows that g\u0303 factors through a smooth natural transformation l\u2217 \u039bg \u2032 , so that Ttra is a\ntransport functor.\n\u0003\nHaving in mind that transport functors correspond to fibre bundles with connection, Proposition\n3.3.4 shows that transport 2-functors on a manifold M naturally induce fibre bundles with connection\non the loop space \u03a9M . In general, these are so-called groupoid bundles [MM03, SW09], whose structure\ngroupoid is \u039bGr. However, in the abelian case, i.e. Gr = BBA for an abelian Lie group A, we have\n\u039bGr \u223c\n= BA (see Lemma 4.2.3 below), so that the transgression Ttra is \u2013 via Theorem 2.4.2 \u2013 a principal\nA-bundle with connection over \u03a9M . This fits well into Brylinski's picture of transgression [Bry93].\n3.3.4\n\nCurving and Curvature\n\n/ T is a transport 2-functor with BG-structure, for G some Lie 2-group coming\nSuppose tra : P2 (M )\nfrom a smooth crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1). Since such 2-functors are supposed to describe (non-abelian)\ngerbes with connection, we want to identify a 3-form curvature. Just as for (non-abelian) principal\nbundles, this curvature is only locally defined.\nFirst we need the following fact: if g and h denote the Lie algebras of the Lie groups G and H,\nrespectively, there is a bijection\n\u001a\n\u001b \u001a\n\u001b\nSmooth 2-functors\nPairs (A, B) \u2208 \u03a91 (X, g) \u00d7 \u03a92 (X, h)\n\u223c\n,\n(3.3.1)\n=\nF : P2 (X) \u2192 BG\nsatisfying t\u2217 (B) = dA + [A \u2227 A]\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\f/ g is the differential of t.

The next proposition\nP2 (M )\nshows that this notion of flatness is equivalent to the vanishing of the curvature.\n/ T is injective on 2-morphisms. A transProposition 3.3.6.

We proceed in two parts. (a): curv(tra) vanishes if and only if triv is a flat 2-functor, and\n(b): tra is flat if and only if triv is flat. The claim (a) follows from Lemma A.11 in [SW11]. To see\n+3 \u03b3 \u2032 in Y which are smoothly homotopic so that\n+3 \u03b3 \u2032 and \u03a32 : \u03b3\n(b) consider two bigons \u03a31 : \u03b3\nthey define the same element in \u03a02 (Y ). Suppose tra is flat and let \u03a3 := \u03a3\u22121\n2 \u2022 \u03a31 . Axiom (T2) for the\ntrivialization t is then\nt(y) \u25e6 \u03c0 \u2217 tra(\u03b3)\n\nt(\u03b3)\n\nidt(y) \u25e6\u03c0 \u2217 tra(\u03a3)\n\n\u0013\nt(y) \u25e6 \u03c0 \u2217 tra(\u03b3)\n\n+3 trivi (\u03b3) \u25e6 t(x)\ntrivi (\u03a3)\u25e6idt(x)\n\nt(\u03b3)\n\n\u0013\n+3 trivi (\u03b3) \u25e6 t(x)\n\nand since \u03c0 \u2217 tra(\u03a3) = id by assumption it follows that trivi (\u03a3) = id, i.e. triv is flat. Conversely,\nassume that triv is flat. The latter diagram shows that tra is then flat on all bigons in the image of\n/ M be a smooth homotopy between two bigons \u03a31 and\n\u03c0\u2217 . This is actually enough: let h : [0, 1]3\n\u03a32 which are not in the image of \u03c0\u2217 . Like explained in Appendix A.3 of [SW11] the cube [0, 1]3 can be\ndecomposed into small cubes such that h restricts to smooth homotopies between small bigons that\nbound these cubes. The decomposition can be chosen so small that each of these bigons is contained\nin the image of \u03c0\u2217 , so that tra assigns the same value to the source and the target bigon of each small\ncube. By 2-functorality of tra, this infers tra(\u03a31 ) = tra(\u03a32 ).\n\u0003\n\n3.4\n\nCurvature 2-Functors\n\nIn this section we provide a class of examples of transport 2-functors coming from transport functors,\ni.e. fibre bundle with connections. If P is a principal G-bundle with connection \u03c9 over M , one can\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\f/ y by an automorphism of Py ,\n\ncompare the parallel transport maps along two paths \u03b31 , \u03b32 : x\nnamely the holonomy around the loop \u03b32 \u25e6 \u03b31\u22121 ,\n\u03c4\u03b32 = Hol\u03c9 (\u03b32 \u25e6 \u03b31\u22121 ) \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b31 .\n\n+3 \u03b32 , this holonomy is related\nIf the paths \u03b31 and \u03b32 are the source and the target of a bigon \u03a3 : \u03b31\nto the curvature of \u2207. So, a principal G-bundle with connection does not only assign fibres Px to\npoints x \u2208 M and parallel transport maps \u03c4\u03b3 to paths, it also assigns a curvature-related quantity to\nbigons \u03a3.\nUnder the equivalence between principal G-bundles with connection and transport functors on X\nwith BG-structure (Theorem 2.4.2), the principal bundle (P, \u03c9) corresponds to the transport functor\n/ G-Tor\n\ntraP : P1 (M )\n\nthat assigns the fibres Px to points x \u2208 M and the parallel transport maps \u03c4\u03b3 to paths \u03b3.

Now we are in the position to introduce our\n\nTheorem 3.4.1. The curvature 2-functor K(tra) is a transport 2-functor with BEG-structure.\nProof. We construct a local trivialization of K(tra) starting with a local trivialization (triv, t) of\n/ BEG be the\n/ M . Let dtriv : P2 (Y )\ntra with respect to some surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\nderivative 2-functor associated to triv [SW11]: on objects and 1-morphisms it is given by triv, and it\n+3 \u03b32 in Y to the unique 2-morphism in BEG between the images of \u03b31 and\nsends every bigon \u03a3 : \u03b31\n\u03b32 under triv.

Its component at a point a \u2208 Y is the 1-morphism\n/ i(\u2217)\n\nK(t)(a) := t(a) : tra(\u03c0(a))\n\n/ b is the unique 2-morphism in Tb. Notice that since t is\nin T . Its component t(\u03b3) at a path \u03b3 : a\na natural transformation, we have a commutative diagram\ntra(\u03c0(a))\n\ntra(\u03c0(\u03b3))\n\nt(a)\n\n\u000f\ni(\u2217)\n\n/ tra(\u03c0(b))\nt(b)\n\ntrivi (\u03b3)\n\n\u000f\n/ i(\u2217)\n\nmeaning that t(\u03b3) = id. This defines the pseudonatural transformation t as required.\nNow we assume that the descent data (triv, gt ) associated to the local trivialization (triv, t) is\nsmooth, and show that then also the descent object (dtriv, gK(t) , \u03c8, f ) is smooth. As observed in\n[SW11], the derivative 2-functor dtriv is smooth if and only if triv is smooth. To extract the remaining\ndescent data according to the procedure described in Section 2.2. It turns out that the only non-trivial\ndescent datum is the pseudonatural transformation\ngK(t) : \u03c01\u2217 dtrivK(i)\n\n/ \u03c0 \u2217 dtrivK(i) .\n2\n\nIts component at a point \u03b1 \u2208 Y [2] is given by gK(t) (\u03b1) := gt (\u03b1), and its component at some path\n/ \u03b1\u2032 is the identity.\n\u0398:\u03b1\nThe last step is to show that\nF (gK(t) ) : P1 (Y [2] )\n\n/ \u039bK(i) Tb\n\nis a transport functor with \u039bBEG-structure. To do so we have to find a local trivialization with smooth\ndescent data. This is here particulary simple: the functor F (gK(t) ) is globally trivial in the sense that\nit factors through the functor\n/ \u039bK(i) Tb.\n\u039bK(i) : \u039bBEG\n\nTo see this we use the smoothness condition on the natural transformation gt , namely that it factors\nthrough a smooth natural transformation g\u0303t . We obtain a smooth pseudonatural transformation\n/ \u03c02\u2217 dtriv such that gK(t) = K(i)(g\u0303K(t) ). This finally gives us\ng\u0303K(t) : \u03c01\u2217 dtriv\nF (gK(t) ) = \u039bK(i) \u25e6 F (g\u0303K(t) )\n\nmeaning that F (gK(t) ) is a transport functor with \u039bBEG-structure.\n\n\u0003\n\nSince the value of the curvature 2-functor K(tra) on bigons does not depend on the bigon itself\nbut only on its source and target path, we have the following.\nProposition 3.4.2. The curvature 2-functor K(tra) of any transport functor is flat.\nThis proposition gains a very nice interpretation when we relate the curvature of a connection \u03c9 in\n/ M to the curvature 2-functor K(traP ) associated to the corresponding\na principal G-bundle p : P\ntransport functor traP . First we show:\n/ G-Tor\n\\ has a canonical smooth p-local\nLemma 3.4.3. The curvature 2-functor K(traP ) : P2 (M )\ntrivialization (p, t, triv). The classical curvature curv(\u03c9) \u2208 \u03a92 (P, g) is the 2-curving of K(traP ) with\nrespect to the trivialization (p, t, triv).\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fProof. As described in detail in [SW09, Section 5.1], traP admits local trivializations with respect to\n/ M and with smooth descent data (triv\u2032 , g) such that the connection\nthe surjective submersion p : P\n/ BG under\n1-form \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a91 (P, g) of the bundle P corresponds to the smooth functor triv\u2032 : P1 (P )\n\u2032\nthe bijection of [SW09, Proposition 4.7]. Then, by [SW11, Lemma 3.5], the 2-form B associated to\ndtriv\u2032 under the bijection (3.3.1), which is by Definition 3.3.5 (i) the 2-curving of K(traP ), is given by\nB \u2032 = d\u03c9 + [\u03c9 \u2227 \u03c9].\nThe latter is by definition the curvature of the connection \u03c9.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe announced interpretation of Proposition 3.4.2 now is as follows: using Lemma 3.4.3 one can\ncalculate the curvature curv(K(traP )) of the curvature 2-functor of traP . The calculation involves the\nsecond Bianchi identity for the connection \u03c9 on the principal G-bundle P , and the result is\ncurv(K(traP )) = 0,\nwhich is according to Proposition 3.3.6 an independent proof of Proposition 3.4.2. In other words,\nProposition 3.4.2 is equivalent to the second Bianchi identity for connections on fibre bundles.\n\n4\n\nTransport 2-Functors are Non-Abelian Gerbes\n\nIn this section we show that transport 2-functors reproduce \u2013 systematically, by choosing appropriate\ntarget 2-categories and structure 2-groups \u2013 four known concepts of gerbes with connections: Deligne\ncocycles and Breen-Messing cocycles (Section 4.1), abelian bundle gerbes (Section 4.2), and nonabelian bundle gerbes (Section 4.3). In Section 4.4 we establish a further relation between transport\n2-functors and 2-vector bundles with connection. Conversely, all these structures are examples of\ntransport 2-functors.\n\n4.1\n\nDifferential Non-Abelian Cohomology\n\n/ T with structure Lie\nIn this section we set up a classifying theory for transport 2-functors P2 (M )\n/\nT , for G a Lie 2-group coming from a smooth crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1), T an\n2-groupoid i : BG\narbitrary 2-category, and i an equivalence of categories. The latter condition together with Theorem\n3.2.2 implies that we have equivalences\n2\n2\n\u221e\n\u223c\nTrans2BG (M, T ) \u223c\n= Des (i)\u221e\nM = Des (idBG )M\n\n(4.1.1)\n\nof 2-categories.\nOur strategy is to translate the structure of the 2-category Des2 (idBG )\u221e\nM into an equivalent 2category of \"non-abelian differential cocycles\" made up of smooth functions and differential forms,\nwith respect to open covers of M . Isomorphism classes of non-abelian differential cocycles form a set\nwhich we define as the non-abelian differential cohomology of M ; it classifies transport 2-functors on\nM with BG-structure up to isomorphism.\n4.1.1\n\nSmooth Functors and Differential Forms\n\nFor the translation of the 2-category Des2 (idBG )\u221e\nM into smooth functions and differential forms we recall\n\u221e\na general result about the 2-category Funct (P2 (X), BG) of smooth 2-functors, smooth pseudonatural\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\ftransformations, and smooth modifications defined on a smooth manifold X, with values in the Lie\n2-groupoid BG.

By [SW09, Corollary 3.13] transport functors over contractible manifolds are naturally equivalent to smooth functors. This applies to the transport functors F (g) contained in a descent object\n(triv, g, \u03c8, f ), and to the transport functor F (h) contained in a descent 1-morphism (h, \u01eb). Such\nnatural equivalences induce a descent 1-morphism (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) \u223c\n= (triv, g\u221e , \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 ) and a descent 2morphism (h, \u01eb) \u223c\n= (h\u221e , \u01eb\u2032 ) with g\u221e and h\u221e smooth. Since the embedding of smooth functors into\ntransport functors is full, all the modifications \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 , \u01eb\u2032 are then automatically smooth.

In particular, if G = BA for an abelian Lie group\nA, then fiji = 1.\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fProof. Suppose ((A, B), (g, \u03c6), \u03c8, f ) is a differential G-cocycle with respect to {Vi }. It is easy to see\nthat one can always pass to a1-isomorphic cocycle with \u03c8i = 1, gii = 1, and fiij = fijj = 1. In order to\nachieve the remaining condition for fiji , we choose a total order on the index set I of the open cover,\nand look at smooth maps\n(\n1\ni\u2264j\n\u01ebij :=\nfiji i > j\ndefined on Vi \u2229 Vj . Then we define yet another differential G-cocycle ((A\u2032 , B \u2032 ), (g \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ), \u03c8 \u2032 , f \u2032 ) via\nequations (4.1.14) to (4.1.19), and it is straightforward to see that this one has the claimed form. \u0003\n\n4.1.4\n\nNon-abelian Differential Cohomology\n\nThe 2-categories Z\u03c02 (G)\u221e of degree two differential G-cocycles form a direct system for surjective\nsubmersions over M , and so do the sets h0 (Z\u03c02 (G)\u221e ) of isomorphism classes of objects.\nDefinition 4.1.5. The direct limit\n\u0124 2 (M, G) := lim\nh0 (Z\u03c02 (G)\u221e )\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nis called the degree two differential non-abelian cohomology of M with values in G.\nThe terminology \"non-abelian differential cohomology\" is motivated by the following observation.\nIf one drops all differential forms from the local data described in Section 4.1.3, and only keeps the\nsmooth functions, the corresponding limit coincides with the non-abelian cohomology H 2 (M, G), as\nit appears for instance in [Gir71, Bre94, Bar04, Woc11]. Thus, Definition 4.1.5 extends ordinary\nnon-abelian cohomology by differential form data.\nWe remark that by Lemma 4.1.4 and the fact that every surjective submersion can be refined by\nan open cover, one can define non-abelian differential cohomology by only using cocycles that are\nnormalized in the sense of Lemma 4.1.4.\nSince every surjective submersion can be refined to a two-contractible one (for example, by a good\nopen cover), it also suffices to take the limit over the two-contractible surjective submersions. Then,\nProposition 4.1.3 and Theorem 3.2.2 imply via (4.1.1) the following classification result.\n/ T be an equivalence of 2-categories.\nTheorem 4.1.6. Let G be a Lie 2-group, and let i : BG\nThen, there is a bijection\nh0 Trans2Gr (M, T ) \u223c\n= \u0124 2 (M, G).\nIn other words, transport 2-functors on M with BG-structure are classified up to isomorphism by the\nnon-abelian differential cohomology of M with values in G.\nLet us specify two particular examples of differential non-abelian cohomology which have appeared\nbefore in the literature:\n1. The Lie 2-group G = BS 1 . We leave it as an easy exercise to the reader to check that our\ndifferential non-abelian cohomology is precisely degree two Deligne cohomology,\n\u0124 2 (M, BS 1 ) = H 2 (M, D(2)).\nDeligne cohomology [Bry93] is a well-known local description of abelian gerbes with connection.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\f2. The Lie 2-group G = AUT(H) for H some ordinary Lie group H. We also leave it to the reader\nto check that our differential cocycles are precisely the local description of connections in nonabelian gerbes given by Breen and Messing [BM05] (see Remark 4.1.7 below). Thus, we have an\nequality\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2 Equivalence classes of local data \uf8fd\n\u0124 2 (M, AUT(H)) =\n.\nof Breen-Messing H-gerbes\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\nwith connection over M\n\nSummarizing, the theory of transport 2-functors covers both Deligne cocycles and Breen-Messing\ncocycles.\nRemark 4.1.7. We remark that condition (4.1.10) between the 1-curving A and the 2-curving B of a\ndifferential G-cocycle is present neither in Breen-Messing gerbes [BM05] nor in the non-abelian bundle\ngerbes of [ACJ05], which we discuss in Section 4.3. Breen and Messing call the local 2-form\nt\u2217 (Bi ) \u2212 dAi \u2212 [Ai \u2227 Ai ]\nwhich is here zero by (4.1.10), the fake curvature of the gerbe. In this terminology, transport 2-functors\nonly cover Breen-Messing gerbes with vanishing fake curvature.\nThe crucial point is here that unlike transport 2-functors, neither Breen-Messing gerbes nor nonabelian bundle gerbes have concepts of holonomy or parallel transport. And indeed, equation (4.1.10)\ncomes from an important consistency condition on this parallel transport, namely from the targetsource matching condition for the transport 2-functor, which makes it possible to decompose parallel\ntransport into pieces. So we understand equation (4.1.10) as an integrability condition which is necessarily for a consistent parallel transport. In other words, vanishing fake curvature is not specifying a\nsubclass of connections, it is a necessary condition every connection has to satisfy.\n\n4.2\n\nAbelian Bundle Gerbes with Connection\n\nIn this section we consider the target 2-category T = B(S 1 -Tor), the monoidal category of S 1 -torsors\nviewed as a 2-category with a single object [SW, Example A.2]. Associated to this 2-category is the\n2-functor\n/ B(S 1 -Tor)\niS 1 : BBS 1\nthat sends the single 1-morphism of BBS 1 to the circle, viewed as an S 1 -torsor over itself. The main\nresult of this section is:\nTheorem 4.2.1. There is an equivalence\nTransBBS 1 (M, B(S 1 -Tor)) \u223c\n= BGrb\u2207 (M )\nbetween the 2-category of transport 2-functors on M with values in B(S 1 -Tor) and with BBS 1 -structure,\nand the 2-category of bundle gerbes with connection over M .\nLet us first recall the definition of bundle gerbes following [Mur96, MS00, Ste00, Wal07].

Second, there is a canonical equivalence of\ncategories\n\u039biS1 B(S 1 -Tor) \u223c\n(4.2.3)\n= S 1 -Tor.\nThis comes from the fact that an object is in both categories an S 1 -torsor.

It is straightforward to see that (4.2.3) is even a monoidal equivalence. Then, the claim is\nproved by Theorem 2.4.2.\n\u0003\nNow, via Lemma 4.2.3 the transport functor F (g) is a principal S 1 -bundle L with connection \u03c9\nover Y [2] .

Namely, if A\u03b1 is the 1-form corresponding to the smooth functor triv\nA\u03b1 = \u03c6\u03b1\n\nand\n\ndA\u03b1 = curv(\u03c9).\n\nThis shows the claim.\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2217\nIn order to complete the construction of the bundle gerbe, we note that the modification f : \u03c023\ng\u25e6\n\u2217\n+3 \u03c0 g induces an isomorphism\n13\n\n\u2217\n\u03c012\ng\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\nF (f ) : \u03c023\nF (g) \u2297 \u03c012\nF (g)\n\n\u2217\n/ \u03c013\nF (g)\n\nof transport functors; again by Lemma 4.2.3 this defines an isomorphism\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03bc : \u03c012\nL \u2297 \u03c023\nL\n\n/ \u03c0\u2217 L\n13\n\nof circle bundles with connection, which is the last ingredient of the bundle gerbe. The coherence\naxiom of [SW, Definition 2.2.1] implies the associativity condition on \u03bc. This shows that (B, L, \u2207, \u03bc)\nis a bundle gerbe with connection. The descent datum \u03c8 has been forgotten by this construction.\nUsing Lemma 4.2.3 in the same way as just demonstrated it is easy to assign bundle gerbe 1morphisms to descent 1-morphisms and bundle gerbe 2-morphisms to descent 2-morphisms. Here the\ncoherence conditions of [SW, Definitions 2.2.2 and 2.2.3] translate into the commutative diagrams\n(4.2.1) and (4.2.2). The composition for 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms of bundle gerbes (which we\nhave not carried out above) is precisely reproduced by the composition laws of the descent 2-category\nDes2\u03c0 (iS 1 )\u221e . This defines the 2-functor of Proposition 4.2.2.\nIt is evident that this 2-functor is an equivalence of 2-categories, since all manipulations we have\nmade are equivalences according to Lemma 4.2.3 and Theorem 4.1.1. It remains to remark that the\ndescent datum \u03c8 can be reproduced in a canonical way from a given bundle gerbe using the existence\nof dual circle bundles, see Lemma 1 in [Wal07]. This finishes the proof of Proposition 4.2.2.\nIt is clear that the equivalence of Proposition 4.2.2 is compatible with the refinement of surjective\nsubmersions, so that it given an equivalence in the direct limits:\n\u2207\n\u223c\nDes2 (iS 1 )\u221e\nM = BGrb (M ).\n\nWith Theorem 3.2.2 this proves Theorem 4.2.1.\n\n4.3\n\nNon-Abelian Bundle Gerbes with Connection\n\nIn this section we generalize the equivalence of the previous section to so-called non-abelian bundle\ngerbes, as defined in [ACJ05]. The difference between abelian and non-abelian bundle gerbes can\nroughly be summarized as follows:\n1. The Lie group S 1 is replaced by some connected Lie group H.\n2. Principal S 1 -bundles are replaced by principal H-bibundles, bundles with commuting left and\nright principal H-action. Morphisms between H-bibundles are bi-equivariant bundle morphisms.\n3. Connections on S 1 -bundles are replaced by so-called twisted connections on bibundles.\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\fNon-abelian H-bundle gerbes with connection over M form a 2-category which we denote by\nH-BGrb\u2207 (M ); some details are reviewed below. There is a sub-2-category H-BGrb\u2207ff (M ) of fake-flat\nnon-abelian H-bundle gerbes, related to Remark 4.1.7.\nOn the side of transport 2-functors, we write H-BiTor for the category whose objects are smooth\nmanifolds with commuting, free and transitive, smooth left and right H-actions, and whose morphisms\nare smooth bi-equivariant maps. Using the product over H this is naturally a (non-strict) monoidal\ncategory, and we write B(H-BiTor) for the corresponding one-object (non-strict) 2-category. Let\nAUT(H) be the Lie 2-group associated to H via Example 3.3.3 (iii). A 2-functor\n/ B(H-BiTor)\n\ni : BAUT(H)\n\n(4.3.1)\n\nis defined as follows. It sends a 1-morphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(H) to the H-bitorsor \u03c6 H which is the group H\non which an element h acts from the right by multiplication and from the left by multiplication with\n\u03c6(h). The compositors of i are given by the canonical identifications\ncg1 ,g2 : g1 H \u00d7H\n\ng2 H\n\n/\n\ng2 g1 H,\n\nand the unitor is the identity. The 2-functor i further sends a 2-morphism h : \u03c61\nbi-equivariant map\n/ \u03c62 H : x \u2724 / hx.\n\u03c61 H\n\n+3 \u03c62 to the\n\nWhile the bi-equivariance with respect to the right action is obvious, the one with respect to the left\naction follows from the condition \u03c62 (x) = h\u03c61 (x)h\u22121 we have for the 2-morphisms in AUT(H) for all\nx \u2208 H.\nThe main result of this section is:\nTheorem 4.3.1. There is a canonical injective map\nh0 (H-BGrb\u2207ff (M ))\n\n/ h0 (Trans2BAUT(H) (M, B(H-BiTor)))\n\nfrom isomorphism classes of fake-flat non-abelian H-bundle gerbes to transport 2-functors with values\nin B(H-BiTor) and BAUT(H)-structure.\nThat we do not achieve a bijection or an equivalence of 2-categories is due to the fact that the\ncategory of bibundles with twisted connections \u2013 as defined in [ACJ05] \u2013 oversees a class of morphisms,\nwhich in principle should be allowed and arise naturally from the theory of transport functors.\nAnyway, Theorem 4.3.1 provides non-trivial examples of transport 2-functors. The injective map\nof Theorem 4.3.1 is constructed as\nH-BGrb\u2207ff (M )\n\n2\n/ Des2 (i)\u221e \u223c\nM = TransBAUT(H) (M, B(H-BiTor)),\n\nwhere the first 2-functor is constructed in Proposition 4.3.8 and the equivalence is the one of Theorem\n3.2.2. We first review necessary material.\n4.3.1\n\nTwisted Connections on Bibundles\n\nLet P be a principal H-bibundle over X. We denote the left and right actions by an element h \u2208 H\non P by lh and rh , respectively. Measuring the difference between the left and the right action in the\nsense of lh (p) = rg(h) (p) furnishes a smooth map\ng:P\n\n/ Aut(H).\n\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n(4.3.2)\n\n\fIn the following we denote by aut(H) the Lie algebra of Aut(H). Further, we denote by t :\n/ H the evaluation.\n/ Aut(H) the assignment of inner automorphisms and by \u03b1 : Aut(H) \u00d7 H\nH\n/ X be a principal H-bibundle, and let A \u2208 \u03a91 (X, aut(H))\nDefinition 4.3.2 ([ACJ05]).

For A = 0 an A-twisted connection on P is the same as an ordinary connection on P\nregarded as a right principal bundle.\n/ X be a principal\nLemma 4.3.4 ([ACJ05]). Let A \u2208 \u03a91 (X, aut(H)) be a 1-form and let p : P\nH-bibundle. For any A-twisted connection \u03c6 on P there exists a unique 1-form A\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a91 (X, aut(H))\nsatisfying\np\u2217 A\u03c6 = Adg (p\u2217 A) \u2212 g \u2217 \u03b8\u0304 \u2212 t\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6,\nwhere g is the map from (4.3.2).\nA twisted connection in a principal bibundle P gives rise to parallel transport maps\n\u03c4\u03b3 : Px\n\n/ Py\n\n/ y. It is obtained in the same\nbetween the fibres of P over points x, y associated to any path \u03b3 : x\nway as in an ordinary principal bundle but using equation (4.3.3) instead of the usual one. As a result\nof the twist, the maps \u03c4\u03b3 are not bi-equivariant; they satisfy\n\u03c4\u03b3 (lF\u03c6 (\u03b3)(h) (p)) = lh\u22121 (\u03c4\u03b3 (p))\n\nand\n\n\u03c4\u03b3 (rh (p)) = rF (\u03b3)\u22121 (h\u22121 ) \u03c4\u03b3 (p)\n\n(4.3.4)\n\n/ Aut(H) are the parallel transport maps associated to the 1-forms A and A\u03c6 ;\nwhere F, F\u03c6 : P X\nsee [SW09, Proposition 4.7]. These complicated relations have a very easy interpretation, as we will\nsee in the next section.\nFinally, an A-twisted connection \u03c6 on a principal H-bundle P has a curvature: this is the 2-form\ncurv(\u03c6) := d\u03c6 + [\u03c6 \u2227 \u03c6] + \u03b1\u2217 (A \u2227 \u03c6) \u2208 \u03a92 (P, h).\nFor two principal H-bibundles P and P \u2032 over X one can fibrewise take the tensor product of P\nand P \u2032 yielding a new principal H-bibundle P \u00d7H P over X. If the two bibundles are equipped with\ntwisted connections, the bibundle P \u00d7H P \u2032 inherits a twisted connection only if the two twists satisfy an\nappropriate matching condition. Suppose the principal H-bibundle P is equipped with an A-twisted\nconnection \u03c6, and P \u2032 is equipped with an A\u2032 -twisted connection \u03c6\u2032 , and suppose that the matching\ncondition\nA\u2032\u03c6\u2032 = A\n(4.3.5)\n\n\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n\fis satisfied. Then, the tensor product bibundle P \u00d7H P \u2032 carries an A\u2032 -twisted connection \u03c6tot \u2208 \u03a91 (P \u00d7H\nP, h) characterized uniquely by the condition that\npr\u2217 \u03c6tot = (g \u25e6 p\u2032 )\u2217 \u25e6 p\u2217 \u03c6 + p\u2032\u2217 \u03c6\u2032 ,\n/ P \u00d7H P \u2032 is the projection to the tensor product and p and p\u2032 are the projections\nwhere pr : P \u00d7X P \u2032\nto the two factors. This tensor product, defined only between appropriate pairs of bibundles with\ntwisted connections, turns Bibun\u2207\nH (X) into a \"monoidoidal\" category.\nA better point of view is to see it as a 2-category: the objects are the twists, i.e. 1-forms\n/ A\u2032 is a principal H-bibundle P with A\u2032 -twisted connection \u03c6\nA \u2208 \u03a91 (X, aut(H)), a 1-morphism A\n+3 (P \u2032 , \u03c6\u2032 ) is just a morphism of principal H-bibundles\nsuch that A\u2032\u03c6\u2032 = A, and a 2-morphism (P, \u03c6)\n\u2032\nthat respects the A -twisted connections.\n4.3.2\n\nTransport Functors for Bibundles with Twisted Connections\n\nWe are now going to relate the category Bibun\u2207\nH (X) of principal H-bibundles with twisted connections\nover X to a category of transport functors. Using the terminology of Section 3.1, we have:\nProposition 4.3.5. There is a surjective and faithful functor\n/ Trans1\u039bBAUT(H) (X, \u039bi B(H-BiTor)).\n\nBibun\u2207\nH (X)\n\nProof. Given a principal H-bibundle P with A-twisted connection, we define the associated transport\nfunctor by\ni(\u2217)\ntraP\n\n:\n\nx\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u2724\n\n/y\n\n/\n\ni(F (\u03b3))\n\n\u03c4\n\nPx\n\n/ i(\u2217)\n2\n2\n2\n22\n2222\n\u221212\n\n2\u03b3\n2222\n\u000f x 222\ni(\u2217)\n\ni(F\u03c6 (\u03b3))\n\nPy\n\n\u000f\n/ i(\u2217).\n\n/ Aut(H) are the maps defined by A and A\u03c6 that we have already used in\nHere F, F\u03c6 : P X\nthe previous section. The definition contains the claim that the parallel transport map \u03c4\u03b3 gives a\nbi-equivariant map\n/ F (\u03b3) H \u00d7H Px ;\n\u03c4\u03b3\u22121 : Py \u00d7H F (\u03b3) H\n\u03c6\nit is indeed easy to check that this is precisely the meaning of equations (4.3.4). A morphism\n/ P \u2032 between bibundles with A-twisted connections induces a natural transformation\nf : P\n/ traP \u2032 between the associated functors, whose component at a point x is the bi\u03b7f : traP\n+3 P \u2032 . This is a particular morphism in \u039bi B(H-BiTor) for which the\nequivariant map fx : Px\nx\nhorizontal 1-morphisms are identities. Here it becomes clear that the assignments\n(P, \u03c6) \u2724\n\n/ traP\n\nand\n\nf \u2724\n\n/ \u03b7f\n\ndefine a functor which is faithful but not full.\nIt remains to check that the functor traP is a transport 2-functor. We leave it as an exercise for\nthe reader to construct a local trivialization (t, triv) of traP with smooth descent data. Hint: use an\nordinary local trivialization of the bibundle P and follow the proof of Proposition 5.2 in [SW09]. \u0003\n\n\u2013 39 \u2013\n\n\fBoth categories in Proposition 4.3.5 have the feature that they have tensor products between\nappropriate objects. Concerning the bibundles with twisted connections, we have described this in\nterms of the matching condition (4.3.5) on the twists. Concerning the category of transport functors,\nthis tensor product is inherited from the one on \u039bi B(H-BiTor), which has been discussed in Section\n3.1.\nLemma 4.3.6. The matching condition (4.3.5) corresponds to the required condition for tensor products in \u039bi B(H-BiTor) under the functor of Proposition 4.3.5. Moreover, the functor respects tensor\nproducts whenever they are well-defined.\nProof. Suppose that the matching condition A\u2032\u03c6\u2032 = A holds, so that principal H-bibundles P and\nP \u2032 with connections \u03c6 and \u03c6 have a tensor product. It follows that the map F\u03c6\u2032 which labels the\nhorizontal 1-morphisms at the bottom of the images of traP \u2032 is equal to the map F which labels the\nones at the top of the images of traP ; this is the required condition for the existence of the tensor\nproduct traP \u2032 \u2297 traP . That the tensor products are respected follows from the definition of the twisted\nconnection \u03c6tot on the tensor product bibundle.\n\u0003\nAn alternative formulation of Lemma 4.3.6 would be that the functor of Proposition 4.3.5 respects\nthe \"monoidoidal structures\", or, that it is a double functor between (weak) double categories.\n4.3.3\n\nNon-Abelian Bundle Gerbes as Transport 2-Functors\n\nLet \u03c0 : Y\n\n/ M be a surjective submersion. We recall:\n\nDefinition 4.3.7 ([ACJ05]). A non-abelian H-bundle gerbe with connection with respect to \u03c0 is a\n/ Y [2] with\n2-form B \u2208 \u03a92 (Y, h), a 1-form A \u2208 \u03a91 (Y, aut(H)), a principal H-bibundle p : P\nA-twisted connection \u03c6 such that\ncurv(\u03c6) = (\u03c01 \u25e6 p)\u2217 B \u2212 (\u03b1g )\u2217 \u25e6 (\u03c02 \u25e6 p)\u2217 B,\n\n(4.3.6)\n\nand an associative morphism\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03bc : \u03c023\nP \u00d7H \u03c012\nP\n\n\u2217\n/ \u03c013\nP\n\nof bibundles over Y [3] that respects the twisted connections.\n/ H is the evaluation. The definitions\nIn (4.3.6), g is the smooth map (4.3.2) and \u03b1 : Aut(H)\u00d7H\nof 1-morphisms and 2-morphisms generalize in a straightforward way the definitions from the abelian\ncase. This defines the 2-category H-BGrb\u2207 (\u03c0). The 2-category H-BGrb\u2207 (M ) of non-abelian Hbundle gerbes over M is defined as the direct limit,\nH-BGrb\u2207 (M ) := lim\nH-BGrb\u2207 (\u03c0).\n\u2192\n\u2212\n\u03c0\n\nWe remark:\n(i) A non-abelian S 1 -bundle gerbe is not the same as an abelian S 1 -bundle gerbe: for the nonabelian bundle gerbes also the automorphisms are important, and Aut(S 1 ) \u223c\n= Z2 . For transport\n2-functors this is even more obvious: the Lie 2-groups BS 1 and AUT(S 1 ) are not equivalent.\n(ii) The non-abelian bundle gerbes of Definition 4.3.7 are a priori not \"fake-flat\", i.e. the relation\nt\u2217 (B) = dA + [A \u2227 A]\n\u2013 40 \u2013\n\n\fmay not be satisfied, see Remark 4.1.7. We denote the sub-2-categories of fake-flat non-abelian\nH-bundle gerbes by H-BGrb\u2207ff (\u2212).\nProposition 4.3.8. For every surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\nH-BGrb\u2207ff (\u03c0)\n\n/ M , there is a 2-functor\n\n/ Des2 (i)\u221e .\n\u03c0\n\nwhich is surjective and faithful on Hom-categories. In particular, it induces an injective map on\nisomorphism classes of objects.\nProof. All relations concerning the bimodules are analogous to those in the abelian case, upon\ngeneralizing Lemma 4.2.3 to Proposition 4.3.5 and Lemma 4.3.6. Relation (4.3.6) for the 2-form B can\nbe proved in the same way as Lemma 4.2.4, but now using the full version of equation (4.1.4). The\ncomments concerning the descent datum \u03c8 also remain valid.\n\u0003\nIn the direct limit, the 2-functors of Proposition 4.3.8 induce a 2-functor\nH-BGrb\u2207ff (M )\n\n/ Des2 (i)\u221e .\nM\n\n(4.3.7)\n\nSince the direct limit respects the operation of forming isomorphism classes of objects, and on the level\nof sets a direct limit of injective maps is injective, the 2-functor (4.3.7) induces an injective map on\nisomorphism classes of objects. This completes the proof of Theorem 4.3.1.\n\n4.4\n\n2-Bundles with Connections\n\nApart from the equivalence between transport functors and principal G-bundles with connection (Theorem 2.4.2), our paper [SW09] also contains an analogous equivalence for vector bundles with connection.\nIt has an immediate generalization to 2-vector bundles with many applications, on which we shall give\na brief outlook.\nSuppose 2Vect is some 2-category of 2-vector spaces. Given a 2-group G, a representation of G on\nsuch a 2-vector space is a 2-functor\n/ 2Vect.\n\u03c1 : BG\nA 2-vector bundle with connection and structure 2-group G is nothing but a transport 2-functor\n/ 2Vect with BG-structure. Important classes of 2-vector bundles are line 2-bundles\ntra : P2 (X)\nand string bundles.\n4.4.1\n\nModels for 2-Vector Spaces\n\nDepending on the precise application there is some flexibility in what one may want to understand\nunder a 2-vector space. Usually 2-vector spaces are abelian module categories over a given monoidal\ncategory. For k a field, two important classes of examples are the following. First, let b\nk be the discrete\nmonoidal category over k. Then, 2Vect is 2-category of module categories over b\nk. This is equivalent\nto the 2-category of categories internal to k-vector spaces. These Baez-Crans 2-vector spaces [BC04]\nare appropriate for the discussion of Lie 2-algebras.\nThe second model for 2Vect is the 2-category of module categories over the monoidal category\nVect(k) of k-vector spaces,\n2Vect := Vect(k)-Mod.\n\u2013 41 \u2013\n\n\fIn its totality this is rather unwieldy, but it contains two important sub-2-categories: the 2-category\nKV(k) of Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector spaces [KV94] and the 2-category Bimod(k), whose objects\nare k-algebras, whose 1-morphisms are bimodules over these algebras and whose 2-morphisms are\nbimodule homomorphisms [Shu08]. Indeed, there is an inclusion 2-functor\n\u001f\u007f /\nVect(k)-Mod\n\u03b9 : Bimod(k)\nthat sends a k-algebra A to the category A-Mod of ordinary (say, right) A-modules. This is a module\ncategory over Vect(k) by tensoring a right module from the left by a vector space. A 1-morphism, an\nA-B-bimodule N , is sent to the functor that tensores a right A-module from the right by N , yielding a\nright B-module. A bimodule morphism induces evidently a natural transformation of these functors.\nIf one restricts the 2-functor \u03b9 to the full sub-2-category formed by those algebras that are direct\nsums A = k \u2295n of the ground field algebra, the 2-vector spaces in the image of \u03b9 are of the form Vect(k)n ,\ni.e. tuples of vector spaces. The 1-morphisms in the image are (m \u00d7 n)-matrices whose entries are\nk-vector spaces. These form the 2-category of Kapranov-Voevodsky 2-vector spaces [KV94].\n4.4.2\n\nThe canonical Representation of a 2-Group\n\nEvery automorphism 2-group AUT(H) of a Lie group H has a canonical representation on 2-vector\nspaces, namely\nA /\n\u03b9\n/ Vect(k)-Mod,\n(4.4.1)\nBAUT(H)\nBimod(k)\nwhere the 2-functor A is defined similar as the one we have used for the non-abelian bundle gerbes in\n(4.3.1). It sends the single object to k regarded as a k-algebra, it sends a 1-morphism \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(H) to\n+3 ch \u25e6 \u03c6 to\nthe bimodule \u03c6 k in the notation of Section 4.3.2, and it sends a 2-morphism (\u03c6, h) : \u03c6\nthe multiplication with h from the left.\nNow let G be any smooth Lie 2-group corresponding to a smooth crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1). We\nhave a canonical 2-functor\ng\n\nBG\n\n/ BAUT(H)\n\n\u2217\n\n:\n\nh\n\n\u03b1g\n\n\u001b \u2724\nC\u2217\n\n/ \u2217\n\n\u0013\n\nh\n\n\u001b\nC\u2217\n\n(4.4.2)\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1g\u2032\n\ng\u2032\n\nwhose composition with (4.4.1) gives a representation of G, that we call the canonical k-representation.\nExample 4.4.1. A very simple but useful example is the canonical C-representation of BC \u00d7 . In this\ncase the composition (4.4.1) is the 2-functor\n\u2212 \u2297C\n\nid\n\n\u03c1\n\n:\n\nBBC \u00d7\n\n/ Vect(C)-Mod\n\n:\n\n\u2217\n\nz\n\n\u001b \u2724\nC\u2217\n\n/ Vect(C)\n\n\u0013\n\nid\n\n\u2212*z\n\n\u0013\n\n$\nVect(C)\n:\n\n\u2212 \u2297C\n\nfor all z \u2208 C \u00d7 . Notice that Vect(C) is the canonical 1-dimensional 2-vector space over C in the same\nsense in that C is the canonical 1-dimensional complex 1-vector space. Therefore, transport 2-functors\ntra : P2 (M )\n\n/ Vect(C)-Mod\n\n\u2013 42 \u2013\n\n\fwith BBC \u00d7 -structure deserve to be addressed as line 2-bundles with connection. Two remarks:\n1. Going through the discussion of abelian bundle gerbes with connection in Section 4.2 it is easy to\nsee that line 2-bundles with connection are equivalent to bundle gerbes with connection defined\nvia line bundles instead of circle bundles.\n2. The fibre tra(x) of a line 2-bundle tra at a point x is an algebra which is Morita equivalent to the\nground field C. These are exactly the finite rank operators on a separable Hilbert space. Thus,\nline 2-bundles with connection are a form of bundles of finite rank operators with connection,\nthis is the point of view taken in [BCM+ 02].\n/ Bimod(k) we have used above can be deformed to a 2-functor\nThe 2-functor A : BAUT(H)\n/ Vect(k) of H. It sends the object of BAUT(H) to\nA using an ordinary representation \u03c1 : BH\n\u03c1\nthe algebra A (\u2217) which is the vector space generated from all the linear maps \u03c1(h). A 1-morphism\n\u03c6 \u2208 Aut(H) is again sent to the bimodule \u03c6 A\u03c1 (\u2217), and the 2-morphisms as before to left multiplications.\nThe original 2-functor is reproduced by A = Atrivk from the trivial representation of H on k.\n\u03c1\n\nExample 4.4.2. For G a compact simple and simply-connected Lie group, we consider the level k\ncentral extension Hk := \u03a9\u0302k G of the group of based loops in G. For a positive energy representation\n/ Vect(k) the algebra A\u03c1 (\u2217) turns out to be a von Neumann-algebra while the bimodules\n\u03c1 : B \u03a9\u0302k G\n\u03c1\n\u03c6 A (\u2217) are Hilbert bimodules. In this infinite-dimensional case we have to make the composition of\n1-morphisms more precise: here we take not the algebraic tensor product of these Hilbert bimodules\nbut the Connes fusion tensor product [ST04]. Connes fusion product still respects the composition: for\nA a von Neumann algebra and \u03c6 A the bimodule structure on it induced from twisting the left action\nby an algebra automorphism \u03c6, we have\n\u03c6A\n\n\u2297 \u03c6\u2032 A \u2243 \u03c6\u2032 \u25e6\u03c6 A\n\nunder the Connes fusion tensor product. Now let G = Stringk (G) be the string 2-group defined from\n/ P0 G of Fr\u00e9chet Lie groups [BCSS07]. Together with the projection\nthe crossed module \u03a9\u0302k G\n2-functor (4.4.2) we obtain an induced representation\n/ BimodCF (k)\n\ni : BStringk (G)\nThe fibres of a transport 2-functor\ntra : P2 (M )\n\n/ BimodCF (k)\n\n(4.4.3)\n\nwith BStringk (G)-structure are hence von Neumann algebras, and its parallel transport along a path is\na Hilbert bimodule for these fibres. In conjunction with the result [BS09, BBK12] that Stringk (G)-2bundles have the same classification as ordinary fibre bundles whose structure group is the topological\nString group, this says that transport 2-functors (4.4.3) have to be addressed as String 2-bundles with\nconnection, see [ST04].\n4.4.3\n\nTwisted Vector Bundles\n\nVector bundles over M twisted by a class \u03be \u2208 H 3 (M, Z) are the same thing as gerbe modules for\na bundle gerbe G whose Dixmier-Douady class is \u03be [BCM+ 02]. These modules are in turn nothing\nelse but certain (generalized) 1-morphisms in the 2-category of bundle gerbes BGrb(M ) [Wal07]. The\n\u2013 43 \u2013\n\n\fsame is true for connections on twisted vector bundles. More precisely, a twisted vector bundle with\nconnection is the same as a 1-morphism\n/ I\u03c1\n\nE :G\n\nfrom the bundle gerbe G with connection to the trivial bundle gerbe I equipped with the connection\n2-form \u03c1 \u2208 \u03a92 (M ).\nNow let\ntra : P2 (M )\n\n/ Vect(C)-Mod\n\nbe a transport 2-functor which plays the role of the bundle gerbe G, but we allow an arbitrary structure\n/ Vect(C)-Mod. Let tra\u221e : P2 (M )\n/ BG be a\n2-group G and any representation \u03c1 : BG\nsmooth 2-functor which plays the role of the trivial bundle gerbe. We shall now consider transport\ntransformations\n/ tra\u221e\nA : tra\n\u03c1 .\n/ M be a surjective submersion for which tra admits a local trivialization with smooth\nLet \u03c0 : Y\ndescent data (triv, g, \u03c8, f ). The descent data of tra\u221e is of course (\u03c0 \u2217 tra\u221e , id, id, id). Now the transport\ntransformation A has the following descent data: the first part is a pseudonatural transformation\n/ \u039b\u03c1 (Vect(C)-Mod) is a transport\n/ \u03c0 \u2217 tra\u221e whose associated functor F (h) : P1 (Y )\nh : triv\n\u2217\n+3 id\u25e6\u03c01\u2217 h whose associated\nfunctor with \u039bBG-structure.

The transport functor\n/ \u039b\u03c1 (Vect(C)-Mod)\n\nF (h) : P1 (Y )\n\ntogether with the natural transformation F (\u01eb) is the general version of a vector bundle with connection\ntwisted by a transport 2-functor tra. According to Sections 4.1 and 4.3, the twists can thus be BreenMessing gerbes or non-abelian bundle gerbes with connection.\nDepending on the choice of the representation \u03c1, our twisted vector bundles can be translated into\nmore familiar language. Let us demonstrate this in the case of Example 4.4.1, in which the twist is a\nline 2-bundle with connection, i.e. a transport 2-functor\ntra : P2 (M )\n\n/ Vect(C)-Mod\n\nwith BBC \u00d7 -structure. In order to obtain the usual twisted vector bundles, we restrict the target\n2-category to BVect(C), the monoidal category of complex vector spaces considered as a 2-category.\nThe following Lie category Gl is appropriate: its objects are the natural numbers N, and it has only\nmorphisms between equal numbers, namely all matrices Gln (C). The composition is the product of\n\u2013 44 \u2013\n\n\fmatrices. The Lie category Gl is strictly monoidal: the tensor product of two objects m, n \u2208 N is\nthe product nm \u2208 N, and the one of two matrices A \u2208 Gl(m) and B \u2208 Gl(n) is the ordinary tensor\nproduct A \u2297 B \u2208 Gl(m \u00d7 n). In fact, Gl carries a second monoidal structure coming from the sum of\nnatural numbers and the direct sum of matrices, so that Gl is actually a bipermutative category, see\nExample 3.1 of [BDR04].\n\u007f\n/ Gl, which induces another inclusion\nNotice that we have a canonical inclusion functor \u03b9 : BC \u00d7 \u001f\n\u03b9\u2217 : Trans2BBC \u00d7 (M, BVect(C))\n\n/ Trans2BGl (M, BVect(C))\n\nof line 2-bundles with connection into more general vector 2-bundles with connection. Here we have\nused the representation\n/ BVect\n\u03c1 : BGl\nobtained as a generalization of Example 4.4.1 from C \u00d7 = Gl1 (C) to Gln (C) for all n \u2208 N. The\ncomposition \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03b9 reproduces the representation of Example 4.4.1.\nUsing the above inclusion, the given transport 2-functor tra induces a transport 2-functor \u03b9\u2217 \u25e6 tra :\n/ BVect(C) with BGl-structure, and one can study transport transformations\nP2 (M )\nA : tra\n\n/ tra\u221e\n\u03c1\n\nin that greater 2-category Trans2BGl (M, BVect(C)). Along the lines of the general procedure described\nabove, we have transport functors F (g) and F (h) coming from the descent data of tra and A, respectively. In the present particular situation, the first one takes values in the category \u039b\u03c1\u25e6\u03b9 BVect1 (C)\nwhose objects are one-dimensional complex vector spaces and whose morphisms from V to W are\n/ C \u2297 V . Similar to Lemma 4.2.3, this category is equivalent to\ninvertible linear maps f : W \u2297 C\nthe category Vect1 (C) of one dimensional complex vector spaces itself. Thus, the transport functor\nF (g) with BC \u00d7 -structure is a complex line bundle L with connection over Y [2] . The second transport\nfunctor, F (h), takes values in the category \u039b\u03c1\u25e6\u03b9 BVect(C). This category is equivalent to the category\nVect(C) itself. It has \u039b\u03b9 BGl-structure, which is equivalent to Gl. Thus, F (h) is a transport functor\nwith values in Vect(C) and Gl-structure. It thus corresponds to a finite rank vector bundle E over Y\nwith connection.\nSince all identifications we have made so far a functorial, the morphisms F (f ) and F (\u01eb) of transport\nfunctors induce morphisms of vector bundles that preserve the connections, namely an associative\nmorphism\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n/ \u03c013\n\u03bc : \u03c023\nL \u2297 \u03c012\nL\nL\nof line bundles over Y [2] , and a morphism\n\u033a : \u03c02\u2217 E \u2297 L\n\n/ \u03c0\u2217 E\n1\n\nof vector bundles over Y which satisfies a compatibility condition corresponding to (4.4.4). This\nreproduces the definition of a twisted vector bundle with connection [BCM+ 02]. We remark that\nthe 2-form \u03c1 that corresponds to the smooth 2-functor tra\u221e\n\u03c1 which was the target of the transport\ntransformation A we have considered, is related to the curvature of the connection on the vector bundle\nE: it requires that\ncurv(E) = In * (curv(L) \u2212 \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c1),\nwhere In is the identity matrix and n is the rank of E. This condition can be derived similar to Lemma\n4.2.4.\n\u2013 45 \u2013\n\n\f5\n\nSurface Holonomy\n\nFrom the viewpoint of a transport 2-functor, parallel transport and holonomy are basically evaluation\n/ T be a transport 2-functor with BG-structure on M . Its\non paths or bigons. Let tra : P2 (M )\nfibres over points x, y \u2208 M are objects tra(x) and tra(y) in T , and we say that its parallel transport\n/ y is given by the 1-morphism\nalong a path \u03b3 : x\ntra(\u03b3) : tra(x)\nin T , and its parallel transport along a bigon \u03a3 : \u03b3\ntra(\u03a3) : tra(\u03b3)\n\n/ tra(y)\n+3 \u03b3 \u2032 is given by the 2-morphism\n+3 tra(\u03b3 \u2032 )\n\nin T . The rules how parallel transport behaves under the composition of paths and bigons are precisely\n/ y and\nthe axioms of the 2-functor tra; see [SW, Definition A.5]. We give some examples. If \u03b31 : x\n/\n\u03b32 : y\nz are composable paths, the separate parallel transports along the two paths are related to\nthe one along their composition by the compositor\nc\u03b31 ,\u03b32 : tra(\u03b32 ) \u25e6 tra(\u03b31 )\n\n+3 tra(\u03b32 \u25e6 \u03b31 )\n\nof the 2-functor tra. If idx is the constant path at x, the parallel transport along idx is related to the\nidentity at the fibre tra(x) by the unitor\nux : tra(idx )\n\n+3 idtra(x) .\n\nThe parallel transports along vertically composable bigons \u03a3 : \u03b31\n\n+3 \u03b32 and \u03a3\u2032 : \u03b32\n\n+3 \u03b33 obey\n\ntra(\u03a3\u2032 \u2022 \u03a3) = tra(\u03a3\u2032 ) \u2022 tra(\u03a3).\nIn the following we focus on certain bigons that parameterize surfaces; the parallel transport along\nthese bigons will be called the holonomy of the transport 2-functor tra.\n\n5.1\n\nMarkings and Fundamental Bigons\n\nSurface holonomy of gerbes has so far only be studied in the abelian case, i.e. for gerbes with structure\n2-group G = BS 1 ; see e.g. [Mur96]. It is understood that an abelian gerbe with connection over M\n/ M defined on closed oriented\nprovides an S 1 -valued surface holonomy for smooth maps \u03c6 : S\nsurfaces S. Various extensions have been studied for oriented surfaces with boundary [CJM02, GR02],\nclosed unoriented (in particular unorientable) surfaces [SSW07], and unoriented surfaces with boundary\n[GSW11].\nLet us try to explain why the step from abelian to non-abelian surface holonomy is so difficult,\nby looking at the analogous but easier situation of ordinary holonomy of a connection on a principal\nbundle P over M . In the abelian case, say with structure group S 1 , holonomy is defined for closed\noriented curves in M . Passing to a non-abelian structure group G, we have two possibilities. The first\nis to choose additional structure on the closed oriented curve, namely a point x \u2208 M , in which case the\nholonomy is a well-defined automorphism of the fibre Px of the bundle P over the point x. The second\npossibility is to project the value of the holonomy into an appropriate quotient, for example along the\n/ Gred into the set Gred of conjugacy classes of G. This quotient is designed such\nmap Aut(Px )\n\n\u2013 46 \u2013\n\n\fthat a different choice of x yields the same element in Gred , and so P has a well-defined Gred -valued\nholonomy for closed oriented curves.\nChoosing a point in a closed oriented curve means to represent it as a path (up to thin homotopy).\n/ M\nThe objective of this section is to describe how to represent a closed oriented surface \u03c6 : S\nas a bigon in M . It will be convenient to adapt the following standard terminology from the theory\nof Riemann surfaces to our setting. Suppose S is a closed oriented surface of genus g. A marking of\ng\n/ x such\n/ x and \u03b2i : x\nS is a point x \u2208 S together with a set M = {\u03b1i , \u03b2i }i=1 of paths \u03b1i : x\nthat the homotopy classes [\u03b1i ] and [\u03b2i ] of the paths form a presentation of the fundamental group of\nS based at x with the relation that [\u03c4M ] = 1, where\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03c4M := \u03b2g\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121\ng \u25e6 \u03b2g \u25e6 \u03b1g \u25e6 . . . \u25e6 \u03b21 \u25e6 \u03b11 \u25e6 \u03b21 \u25e6 \u03b11 .\n\nIn other words,\n\u03c01 (S, x) = h[\u03b1i ], [\u03b2i ] | [\u03c4M ] = 1i .\nNext we formulate - in the language of bigons - the statement that the path \u03c4M can be collapsed\nto the point x in such a way that the collapsing homotopy parameterizes the surface S. The challenge\nis that such a homotopy cannot simultaneously be a bigon and a good parameterization. We propose\nthe following notion.\nDefinition 5.1.1. A fundamental bigon with respect to the marking (x, M) is a bigon \u03a3 : \u03c4M\nsuch that there exist:\n(a) a polygon P \u2286 R2 and a surjective smooth map \u03c0 : P\nto the interior of P and preserves the orientations.\n\n+3 idx\n\n/ S that is an embedding when restricted\n\n/ P that restricts to a diffeomorphism between the\n(b) a surjective continuous map k : [0, 1]2\ninteriors and preserves the orientations, such that there exists a vertex v0 of P with v0 = k(s, 0) =\nk(s, 1) = k(1, t) for all 0 \u2264 s, t \u2264 1.\n/ S with h0 = \u03c0 and h1 \u25e6 k = \u03a3, such that for each edge e of P the\n(c) a smooth map h : [0, 1] \u00d7 P\nrestriction h|[0,1] \u00d7e has rank one, and h(\u2212, v) = x for each vertex v.\nIn this definition the polygon P serves as the standard parameter domain of the surface, and the\n/ S is such a parameterization. The map k : [0, 1]2\n/ P is responsible for the transition\nmap \u03c0 : P\nbetween the standard parameter domain P and the parameter domain [0, 1]2 for bigons. The map h\nensures that the fundamental bigon \u03a3 is homotopic to the \"bigonized\" standard parameterization,\n\u03c0 \u25e6 k. The various conditions on k and h ensure that the homotopy h \u25e6 k is constantly equal to x\nover the boundary parts of [0, 1]2 that are parameterized by (s, 0), (s, 1), and (1, t), and ensure that it\nrestricts to a thin homotopy between the path (\u03c0 \u25e6 k)(0, \u2212) and \u03c4M over the remaining boundary part\n(0, t).\nA marking will be called good , if it admits a fundamental bigon. The following three lemmata\nelaborate some properties of good markings and fundamental bigons.\nLemma 5.1.2. Every closed oriented surface S has a good marking.\nProof. It is well-known that every surface S of positive genus g > 0 has a \"fundamental polygon\"\n/ S that has all required properties. It can be\nP \u2286 C with 4g edges, together with a map \u03c0 : P\n\n\u2013 47 \u2013\n\n\farranged such that all vertices go to a single point x \u2208 S, and - if the 4g edges are parameterized by\n/ P in counter-clockwise order starting at a vertex v0 - then\nA1 , B1 , A\u20321 , B1\u2032 , A2 , ... : [0, 1]\n\u03c0(Ai (1 \u2212 t)) = \u03c0(A\u2032i (t))\n\nand\n\n\u03c0(Bi (1 \u2212 t)) = \u03c0(Bi\u2032 (t)).\n\n(5.1.1)\n\nLet D \u2286 C denote the disc centered at \u22121 \u2208 C. It is obvious that P and D are homeomorphic. The\nhomeomorphism can be arranged such that (i) it preserves orientations, (ii) it is a smooth embedding\nwhen restricted to the complement of the vertices of P, and (iii) the vertices map to points equidistantly\ndistributed over the boundary of D, with v0 at 0 \u2208 C. We define\nk \u2032 : [0, 1]2\n\n/ D : (s, t) \u2724\n\n/ (1 \u2212 s)(e2\u03c0it \u2212 1).\n\nUnder the homeomorphism between P and D, this gives the map k with all required properties.\n/ S is chosen such that h1 : P\n/ S is constantly equal to x in\nThe map h : [0, 1] \u00d7 P\nneighborhoods of all vertices, and such that (5.1.1) remains true with h1 instead of \u03c0. Then we define\n\u03a3 := h1 \u25e6 k\nThis is smooth because h1 is locally constant at all points where k is not smooth. We consider for\n/ [0, 1] : t \u2724 / k+t that squeezes the interval into the k-th of 4g\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 4g \u2212 1 the map pk : [0, 1]\n4g\nmany pieces. Then, we define for i = 1, .., g\n\u03b1i := \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a3(0, \u2212) \u25e6 p4i\u22124\n\nand\n\n\u03b2i := \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03a3(0, \u2212) \u25e6 p4i\u22123 ,\n\nwhich give smooth maps with sitting instants, each going from x to x, Thus, (x, M) with M := {\u03b1i , \u03b2i }\n+3 idx .\nis a marking, and (5.1.1) imply that \u03a3 is a bigon \u03a3 : \u03c4M\nThe case of genus g = 0 can be treated in a similar way using the disc D1 with one marked point;\nthis is left as an exercise.\n\u0003\nThe main idea behind the definition of a fundamental bigon is that the integral of a 2-form \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (S)\nover S can be computed over a fundamental bigon.\nLemma 5.1.3. Suppose S is a closed oriented surface with a good marking (x, M). Let \u03a3 be a fundamental bigon with respect to (x, M). Then,\nZ\nZ\n\u03c9=\n\u03a3\u2217 \u03c9\nS\n\n[0,1]2\n\nfor all 2-forms \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a92 (S).\nProof. We choose the structure (P, k, \u03c0, h) of Definition 5.1.1. Then,\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03a3 \u03c9=\nh1 \u03c9 =\nh1 \u03c9 =\n\u03c0 \u03c9=\n\u03c9=\nS\n\nP\n\nP\n\nint(P)\n\n(0,1)2\n\n\u03a3\u2217 \u03c9.\n\n[0,1]2\n\nThe second equality holds because the homotopy h between h0 = \u03c0 and h1 has rank one on the\nboundary. The other equalities hold immediately due to the assumptions on all the involved maps. \u0003\nFinally, we show that the choice of a fundamental bigon is essentially unique.\n+3 idx\nLemma 5.1.4. Let S be a closed oriented surface and (x, M) be a marking. Suppose \u03a3 : \u03c4M\n+3 idx are two fundamental bigons with respect to the marking (x, M). Then, \u03a3 and \u03a3\u2032\nand \u03a3\u2032 : \u03c4M\nare thin homotopy equivalent in the sense of Section 2.1.\n\u2013 48 \u2013\n\n\fProof. We choose for both fundamental bigons the structures (P, k, \u03c0, h) and (P \u2032 , k \u2032 , \u03c0 \u2032 , h\u2032 ) of Definition 5.1.1. We can assume that P = P \u2032 , since any two polygons are diffeomorphic, and such\ndiffeomorphism can be absorbed into \u03c0 \u2032 and k \u2032 . We can assume that P is convex; in that case it is\neasy to see that k and k \u2032 are homotopic, with the homotopy fixing the three boundary components\nthat map to v0 , and restricting to a homotopy with values in \u2202P over the forth boundary component.\nThe homotopies h and h\u2032 restrict on the boundary to thin homotopies \u03c0|\u2202P \u2243 \u03c4M and \u03c0 \u2032 |\u2202P \u2243 \u03c4M .\nBy a version of Alexander's trick, we obtain a smooth homotopy \u03c0 \u2243 \u03c0 \u2032 that fixes all vertices and has\nrank one over the edges. Then we have chains of homotopies\n\u03a3 \u2243 h1 \u25e6 k \u2243 h0 \u25e6 k \u2243 \u03c0 \u25e6 k \u2243 \u03c0 \u25e6 k \u2032 \u2243 \u03c0 \u2032 \u25e6 k \u2032 \u2243 h\u20320 \u25e6 k \u2032 \u2243 h\u20321 \u25e6 k \u2032 \u2243 \u03a3\u2032\nwhich are all smooth and have rank one restricted over the boundary. By dimensional reasons, this\nhomotopy can at most have rank two everywhere. This means that it is a thin homotopy between \u03a3\nand \u03a3\u2032 .\n\u0003\nNext we come to the definition of surface holonomy. Since the generic transport 2-functor is not\nstrict, we have to deal with the difference between the 1-morphism tra(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c4M ) and the 1-morphism\ntra\u03c6,M :=\n\ng\nY\n\n\u22121\ntra(\u03b1i ) \u25e6 tra(\u03b2i ) \u25e6 tra(\u03b1\u22121\ni ) \u25e6 tra(\u03b2i ),\n\ni=1\n\nfor which we may agree for an arbitrary convention how to put parentheses in case T has a non-trivial\nassociator. The relation between these two 1-morphisms is given by a 2-morphism\nc\u03c6,tra : tra\u03c6,M\n\n+3 tra(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c4M )\n\nmade up from the compositors of tra in a unique way, due to the coherence axiom for compositors\n(this is axiom (F3) in [SW, Appendix A]).\n/ T be a transport 2-functor. Suppose S is a closed oriented\nDefinition 5.1.5. Let tra : P2 (M )\n/ M . Let \u03a3 be a fundamental\nsurface equipped with a good marking (x, M) and a smooth map \u03c6 : S\nbigon for (x, M). The 2-morphism\nHoltra (\u03c6, x, M) := tra(\u03c6\u2217 \u03a3) \u2022 c\u03c6,tra : tra\u03c6,M\n\n+3 tra(id\u03c6(x) )\n\nin T is called the surface holonomy of tra.\nNote that the surface holonomy is independent of the choice of the fundamental bigon due to\nLemma 5.1.4. On the other hand, the surface holonomy does depend on the choice of the marking\n(x, M). Even worse, it is not invariant under isomorphisms between transport 2-functors. It is the\npurpose of the following discussion to improve these dependence issues.\n\n5.2\n\nReduced Surface Holonomy\n\nWe consider a Lie 2-group G defined from a smooth crossed module (G, H, t, \u03b1), and restrict our\nattention to transport 2-functors\n/ T\ntra : P2 (M )\nwith BG-structure. Our goal is to replace the 2-functor tra by another 2-functor which takes values\nin a certain quotient of G where surface holonomy becomes more rigid. In order to construct this\n\u2013 49 \u2013\n\n\fquotient, we write [G, H] \u2286 H for the subgroup of H that is generated by all elements of the form\nh\u22121 \u03b1(g, h), for h \u2208 H and g \u2208 G. The following lemma follows from the axioms of a crossed module;\nsee Definition 3.3.2).\nLemma 5.2.1. The subgroup [G, H] is normal in H and contains the commutator subgroup,\n[H, H] \u2702 [G, H] \u2702 H.\nWe come to the following important definition.\nDefinition 5.2.2. Let G be a Lie 2-group. Then, the group Gred := H/[G, H] is called the reduction\nof G.\nBy Lemma 5.2.1, the reduction Gred is a subgroup of the abelianization H/[H, H] and hence abelian.\nNote that the projection to the quotient yields a strict 2-functor\nRed : BG\n\n/ BBGred .\n\nExample 5.2.3. Let us look at examples for Lie 2-groups G:\n(a) In the case of the 2-group BA for A an ordinary abelian Lie group, [1, A] is the trivial group, and\n(BA)red = A.\n(b) Let G be a Lie group and let EG the associated 2-group of inner automorphisms, see Section 3.\nSince \u03b1 here is the conjugation action of G on itself, [G, G] is indeed the commutator subgroup.\nThus (EG)red is an abelian Lie group, the abelianization of G.\n(c) Let H be a connected Lie group and let AUT(H) be its automorphism 2-group, with G = Aut(H).\nIn this case [H, H] = [G, H] if and only if all automorphisms of H are inner. For H = S 1 with\nAut(S 1 ) = Z2 we get [Z2 , S 1 ] = S 1 , so that AUT(S 1 )red = 1.\n/ T be a transport 2-functor with BG-structure. The following definition\nLet tra : P2 (M )\nintroduces the replacement for tra that we want to consider.\nDefinition 5.2.4. A reduction of tra is a transport 2-functor trared : P2 (M )\nsuch that the following two conditions are satisfied:\n\n/ BG with BG-structure\n\n(i) There exists a pseudonatural equivalence i \u25e6 trared \u223c\n= tra.\n(ii) The 2-functor Red \u25e6 trared is normalized in the sense of [SW, Appendix A].\nIn the following proposition we prove an existence and uniqueness result for reductions.\n/ T is an equivalence of categories, then every transport 2-functor\nProposition 5.2.5. If i : BG\nwith i-structure admits a reduction. Moreover, two reductions of the same transport 2-functor are\npseudonaturally equivalent.\n/ T is an equivalence of 2-categories we can choose an inverse 2-functor\nProof. Since i : BG\n/ BG, so that tra\u2032 := j \u25e6 tra : P2 (M )\n/ BG is a transport 2-functor with BG-structure;\nj :T\nsee Section 3.3.1. Since j is inverse to i it is clear that i \u25e6 tra\u2032 \u223c\n= tra. The 2-functor tra\u2032 is the first\napproximation of the reduction whose existence we want to prove.\n\u2013 50 \u2013\n\n\f/ M the following strictly commutative diagram\n\nWe consider for any surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\nof 2-categories and 2-functors:\nZ\u03c02 (G)\u221e\n\nP\n\nRed\u25e6\u2212\n\n/ Des2\u03c0 (idBG )\u221e\n\n/ Des2\u03c0 (Red)\u221e\nRec\n\nRec\n\n\u000f\n\nTrans2BG (M, BG)\n\nRed\u25e6\u2212\n\n\u000f\n/ Trans2BG (M, BBGred ).\n\n/ M can be chosen such that Rec\u25e6P is essentially\nBy Theorem 4.1.6 the surjective submersion \u03c0 : Y\nsurjective, i.e. we can chose a degree two differential G-cocycle \u03be \u2032 \u2208 Z\u03c02 (G)\u221e such that Rec(P(\u03be)) \u223c\n=\ntra\u2032 . After a refinement of the surjective submersion to an open cover, Lemma 4.1.4 allows us to assume\nthat \u03be \u2032 is isomorphic to another cocycle \u03be \u2032\u2032 = ((A, B), (g, \u03c6), \u03c8, f ) with \u03c8i = 1, gii = 1, fiij = fijj = 1\n\u22121\nand fiji = yij\n\u03b1(xij , yij ) for all i \u2208 I and elements xij \u2208 G, yij \u2208 H. Let tra\u2032\u2032 := Rec(P(\u03be \u2032\u2032 )); we will\nprove that this is the reduction we a looking for.\nCondition (i) for reductions is satisfied because tra\u2032\u2032 = Rec(P(\u03be \u2032\u2032 )) \u223c\n= tra\u2032 . In order\n= Rec(P(\u03be \u2032 )) \u223c\n\u2032\u2032\nto show that the second condition is satisfied, we claim that the object Red \u25e6 P(\u03be ) in Des2\u03c0 (Red)\u221e\nis normalized in the sense of [SW, Definition 2.2.1]. Then, by [SW, Lemma 3.3.4], the reconstructed\ntransport 2-functor is normalized. By commutativity of the diagram, this 2-functor is Red \u25e6 tra\u2032\u2032 .\nIn order to prove that claim, we first remark that (triv, g, \u03c8, f ) := P(\u03be \u2032\u2032 ) is \"almost\" normalized.\nIndeed, the conditions gii = 1 and \u03c8i = 1 imply under the 2-functor P that idtrivi = \u2206\u2217 g and\n\u03c8 = id\u2206\u2217 g . The remaining conditions g \u25e6 \u2206\u221721 g = id\u03c01\u2217 trivi and \u2206\u2217121 f = id\u2206\u221711 g are not satisfied.\n\u22121\nHowever, since fiji = yij\n\u03b1(xij , yij ), after composing with Red we do have Red(fiji ) = 1; and hence\nsatisfy the remaining conditions for a normalized descent object.\nFinally, the claim that the reduction is unique up to pseudonatural equivalence follows immediately\nfrom the assumption that i is an equivalence.\n\u0003\n/ T with BGIn the following we will always replace a given transport 2-functor tra : P2 (M )\n/ BG, and consider the reduced surface holonomy\nstructure by a reduction trared : P2 (M )\nRHoltra (\u03c6, x, M) := HolRed\u25e6trared (\u03c6, x, M) \u2208 Gred .\nThe following lemma shows that the reduced surface holonomy is well-defined.\nLemma 5.2.6. The reduced surface holonomy is independent of the choice of the reduction trared .\nProof.\nSuppose we have two choices, whose compositions with Red we denote by\n/ BBGred . Since t1 and t2 are normalized we have RHolti (\u03c6, x, M) = ti (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a3) \u2022 c\u03c6,ti\nt1 , t2 : P2 (M )\nfor i = 1, 2.\n/ t2 . In the\nBy Lemma 5.2.5 t1 and t2 are related by a pseudonatural equivalence \u03b7 : t1\nfollowing we use that the target 2-category BBGred of t1 and t2 is strict, and both horizontal and\nvertical composition of 2-morphisms is just multiplication in the group Gred . Since this group is\nabelian, it follows that an arbitrary composition of 2-morphisms is just the product of their values, in\nany order.\nUnder these preliminaries, axiom (T2) for \u03b7 applied to the 2-morphism \u03c6\u2217 \u03a3 becomes the identity\n\u03b7(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c4M ) * t2 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a3) = t1 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a3) * \u03b7(id\u03c6(x) ).\n\n(5.2.1)\n\nAxiom (T1) for \u03b7 applied to the 1-morphism \u03c6\u2217 \u03c4M becomes\n\u03b7(\u03c6\u2217 \u03c4M ) * c\u03c6,t1 = c\u03c6,t2 *\n\ng\nY\n\n\u22121\n\u03b7(\u03b1i )\u03b7(\u03b2i )\u03b7(\u03b1\u22121\ni )\u03b7(\u03b2i ).\n\ni=1\n\n\u2013 51 \u2013\n\n(5.2.2)\n\n\fWe are allowed to permute the factors on the right hand side. Since t1 and t2 are normalized, we have\nby [SW, Lemma A.7 (ii)] that \u03b7(id\u03c6(x) ) = 1 and \u03b7(\u03b1i )\u03b7(\u03b1\u22121\ni ) = 1. Now combining (5.2.1) with (5.2.2)\n\u0003\nyields t1 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a3) \u2022 c\u03c6,t1 = t2 (\u03c6\u2217 \u03a3) \u2022 c\u03c6,t2 , which is the equality between the surface holonomies.\n\n5.3\n\nProperties of Reduced Surface Holonomy\n\nThe reduced surface holonomy has nice properties that we will reveal in the following. First we treat\nthe dependence of the reduced surface holonomy on the marking.\nWe arrange the set of markings of S into equivalence classes, as it is common in the theory of\nRiemann surfaces. Two markings (x, M) and (x\u2032 , M\u2032 ), with M = {\u03b1i , \u03b2i } and M\u2032 = {\u03b1\u2032i , \u03b2i\u2032 }, are\n+3 \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b1\u2032 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 and \u2206\u2032 :\n/ x\u2032 and bigons \u2206i : \u03b1i\ncalled equivalent , if there exists a path \u03b3 : x\ni\ni\n\u2032\n\u22121\n+3 \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b2 \u25e6 \u03b3 .\n\u03b2i\ni\nLemma 5.3.1. Let (x, M) and (x\u2032 , M\u2032 ) be equivalent good markings. Then,\nRHoltra (\u03c6, x, M) = RHoltra (\u03c6, x\u2032 , M\u2032 ).\nProof. Each equivalence between markings splits into a sequence of steps, in which a step is either\n/ y, or changing one of the paths via a\nconjugation of all paths in the marking by a path \u03b3 : x\nbigon. Thus it suffices to prove the invariance of the reduced surface holonomy under each of these\n/ BG be a reduction of tra, and let t := Red \u25e6 trared .\nsteps. Let trared : P2 (M )\n+3 idx be a fundamental bigon\nIn the first part of the proof we look at a conjugation. Let \u03a3 : \u03c4M\n\u2032\nfor a marking (x, M). Denote by (x , M\u03b3 ) the marking obtained by conjugating all paths with \u03b3. We\nhave \u03c4M\u03b3 = \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03c4M \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 , and \u03a3\u03b3 := id\u03b3 \u25e6 \u03a3 \u25e6 id\u03b3 \u22121 is a fundamental bigon for (x\u2032 , M\u03b3 ). We have the\n+3 t(\u03c4M\u03b3 ), so\n+3 t(\u03c4M ) and c\u03c6,t\ntwo paths t\u03c6,M and t\u03c6,M\u03b3 and the compositors c\u03c6,t : t\u03c6,M\n\u03b3 : t\u03c6,M\u03b3\nthat\nHolt (\u03c6, x, M) = t(\u03a3) * c\u03c6,t and Holt (\u03c6, x\u2032 , M\u2032 ) = t(\u03a3\u03b3 ) * c\u03c6,t\n\u03b3 .\nHere, and in the following we will suppress writing \u03c6\u2217 when we apply t to paths or bigons in S.\n+3 t(\u03b3) \u25e6 t\u03c6,M \u25e6 t(\u03b3)\u22121 , and another unique\nThere is a unique compositor 2-morphism c : t\u03c6,M\u03b3\n+3 t(\u03b3) \u25e6 t(\u03c4M ) \u25e6 t(\u03b3)\u22121 .

The subdiagram on the left commutes because of the coherence of compositors enforced by axiom (F3). In order to see that the subdiagram on the right commutes we note that\nc\u2032 = c\u03c4M\u03b3 \u25e6\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03b3 * c\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03c4M\u03b3 . Axiom (F2) applied to the 2-morphisms id, \u03a3\u03b3 and id gives the commutativity with c\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03b3 * c\u03b3 \u22121 ,id on the right hand side of the diagram. But the latter expression is equal to\n1 for the normalized 2-functor t.\nNext we compute c. We note the compositor between t(\u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b1 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 ) and t(\u03b3) \u25e6 t(\u03b1) \u25e6 t(\u03b3 \u22121 ) is\nc\u03b1\u25e6\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03b3 *c\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03b1 , while the one between t(\u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b1\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b3 \u22121 ) and t(\u03b3)\u25e6 t(\u03b1\u22121 )\u25e6 t(\u03b3 \u22121 ) is c\u03b1\u22121 \u25e6\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03b3 *c\u03b3 \u22121 ,\u03b1\u22121 .\nThese two compositors are actually inverse to each other; this follows from axiom (F3) for compositors\n\n\u2013 52 \u2013\n\n\fand the fact that t is normalized. Also note that t(\u03b3) \u25e6 t(\u03b3 \u22121 ) = id; again since t is normalized. Thus,\nwe see that c = 1. All together, we see that Holt (\u03c6, x, M) = Holt (\u03c6, x\u2032 , M\u2032 ).\ng\nIn the second part of the proof we look at a change of one of the paths via a bigon. If M = {\u03b1i , \u03b2i }i=1\n\u2032\nis a marking, we look at another marking M consisting of the same paths except for an index i0 where\n+3 \u03b1\u22121 be\n+3 \u03b1i0 .

Indeed, the rectangular part commutes due to axiom (F2) for the 2-functor t, and\nthe triangular part commutes by definition of \u03a3\u2032 . It remains to notice that t\u2206 = 1 \u2208 Gred , since\nthe contributions of \u2206 and \u2206# cancel. Then, the diagram implies the coincidence of the surface\nholonomies.\n\u0003\nWe summarize our results about the surface holonomy of non-abelian gerbes in the following theorem, which constitutes the main result of this section.\n/ T be an equivalence of\nTheorem 5.3.2.

After Lemma 5.3.1 it only remains to prove that the reduced surface holonomy only depends\non the isomorphism class of tra. Indeed, if tra \u223c\n= tra\u2032 is an isomorphism we can choose the same\nreduction for both.\n\u0003\nIn Section 4 we have collected various equivalences between transport 2-functors and concrete\nmodels of gerbes with connections. These equivalences were mostly established by zigzags of canonically\ndefined 2-functors. On the level of isomorphism classes, such zigzags give a well-defined bijection. Since\nthe reduced surface holonomy is invariant under isomorphisms, these bijections convey the concept of\nreduced surface holonomy to a well-defined, isomorphism-invariant concept for each of these concrete\nmodels:\n(i) The bijection\n\u0124 2 (M, G) \u223c\n= h0 Trans2Gr (M, T )\n\u2013 53 \u2013\n\n\fof Theorem 4.1.6 between the non-abelian differential cohomology and transport 2-functors equips\nnon-abelian cohomology with a well-defined, isomorphism-invariant concept of surface holonomy.\nIn particular, it equips degree two Deligne cocycles and (fake-flat) Breen-Messing cocycles with a\nwell-defined, isomorphism-invariant concept of surface holonomy. We show below in Proposition\n5.3.3 in the case of Deligne cocycles it reproduces the existing concept of surface holonomy.

Such a concept was\npreviously unknown; it is one of the main results of this article.\nNow we prove that the reduced surface holonomy of Theorem 5.3.2 reduces in the case G = BS 1\nto the established notion of surface holonomy for connections on BS 1 -gerbes. Let us first recall that\nestablished notion.\nIt can be given for an element \u03be \u2208 \u0124 2 (M, BS 1 ) of the (abelian) differential cohomology group\nwhich classifies BS 1 -gerbes.

By commutativity of the\ndiagram, we find an isomorphism\nF \u223c\n(5.3.2)\n= \u03c6\u2217 trared\nbetween transport 2-functors.\nIf now \u03a3 is a fundamental bigon for the marking (x, M), then we have on one side\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 Z\n\u0012 Z\n(5.3.1)\nLemma 5.1.3\nB\nAbHol\u03be (\u03c6) := exp \u2212 B\n=\nexp \u2212\n= F (\u03a3) = HolF (id, x, M),\n\u03a3\n\nS\n\nwhere the last equality is Definition 5.1.5 combined with the fact that F is a strict 2-functor (with\ntrivial compositors). Lemma 5.2.6 applied to the equivalence (5.3.2) shows that\nHolF (id, x, M) = Hol\u03c6\u2217 trared (id, x, M).\nWe have on the other side\nHol\u03c6\u2217 trared (id, x, M) = Holtrared (\u03c6, x, M) = RHoltra (\u03c6, x, M),\nthis shows the claimed coincidence.\n\n\u0003\n\nFinally, let us comment on the dependence of the reduced surface holonomy on the equivalence\nclass of a marking. Let S be a closed oriented surface, and let (x, M) and (x\u2032 , M\u2032 ) two markings. A\nstandard result from the theory of Riemann surfaces is:\n(i) There exists an orientation-preserving diffeomorphism f : S\n\n/ S such that (x\u2032 , M\u2032 ) = f (x, M),\n\n(ii) The diffeomorphism f is homotopic to the identity map idS if and only if (x, M) and (x\u2032 , M\u2032 ) are\nequivalent.\nThe quotient of the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms modulo those homotopic to the\nidentity is the mapping class group of S, denoted M(S). Thus, M(S) acts on the reduced surface\n/ M . Currently we do not know what this action is; in particular, we\nholonomies of a surface \u03c6 : S\ndo not know if it is trivial or not.\n\u2013 55 \u2013\n\n\fReferences\n[ACJ05]\n\nP. Aschieri, L.
