We also discuss possible applications to particle phenomenology\nand, via a 2-D analogue, to string theory.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction and formulation of the problem\n\nOur knowledge about non-supersymmetric Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in four dimensions\n(4D) is still quite incomplete. Suffices it to say that not a single nontrivial example is known which\nwould be solvable to the same extent as, say, the 2D Ising model. However, we do not doubt that\nCFTs must be ubiquitous. For example, non-supersymmetric gauge theories with Nc colors and\nNf flavors are widely believed to have \"conformal windows\" in which the theory has a conformal\nfixed point in the IR, with evidence from large Nc analysis [1], supersymmetric analogues [2], and\nlattice simulations [3]. Since these fixed points are typically strongly coupled, we do not have\nmuch control over them. In this situation particularly important are general, model-independent\nproperties.\nOne example of such a property is the famous unitarity bound [4] on the dimension \u2206 of a\nspin l conformal primary operator O\u2206,l :1\n\u2206 \u2265 1 (l = 0) ,\n\u2206 \u2265 l + 2 (l \u2265 1) .\n\n(1.1)\n\nThese bounds are derived by imposing that the two point function hOOi have a positive spectral\ndensity.\nAs is well known, 3-point functions in CFT are fixed by conformal symmetry up to a few arbitrary constants (Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients). The next nontrivial constraint\nthus appears at the 4-point function level, and is known as the conformal bootstrap equation. It\nsays that OPE applied in direct and crossed channel should give the same result (see Fig. 1).\nThe bootstrap equation goes back to the early days of CFT [5]. However, until recently, not\nmuch useful general information has been extracted from it2 . All spins and dimensions can apriori\nenter the bootstrap on equal footing, and this seems to lead to unsurmountable difficulties.\n\u03a6\n\n\u03a6\nO\n\n\u00e2\n\n= \u00da\nO\n\nO\n\n\u03a6\n\n\u03a6\n\nFigure 1: The conformal bootstrap equation. The thick red line denotes a conformal\nblock, summing up exchanges of a primary operator O and all its descendants.\n\nRecently, however, tangible progress in the analysis of bootstrap equations was achieved in\n[7]. Namely, it was found that, in unitary theories, the functions entering the bootstrap equations\n1\n\nHere we quote only the case of symmetric traceless tensor operators.\nExcept in 2D, in theories with finitely many primary fields and in the Liouville theory [6]. We will comment\non the 2D case in Sections 4.1 and 5 below.\n2\n\n1\n\n\fallowed\n(no positivity property)\n\nexcluded\n(positivity property exists)\n\nf HdL\n\nDmin\n\nFigure 2: The bound f (d) is the smallest \u2206min for which a positivity property exists.\n\n(conformal blocks) satisfy certain positivity properties which lead to general necessary conditions\nfor the existence of solutions.\nThe concrete problem considered in [7], and which we will continue to discuss here, was as\nfollows. In an arbitrary unitary CFT a Hermitean scalar primary \u03c6d of dimension d was singled\nout. The conformal bootstrap equation for its 4-point function h\u03c6d \u03c6d \u03c6d \u03c6d i was studied under the\nsole assumption that all scalars in the OPE \u03c6d \u00d7 \u03c6d have dimension above a certain number, call\nit \u2206min :\n\u03c6d \u00d7 \u03c6d = 1 + (Scalars of dimension \u2265 \u2206min ) + (Higher spins) .\n(1.2)\nIt was shown that the conformal bootstrap does not allow for a solution unless\n\u2206min \u2264 f (d) ,\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere f (d) is a certain continuous function, computed numerically. We stress that this conclusion\nwas reached without making any assumptions about dimensions or spins of other operators appearing in the OPE, beyond those implied by the unitarity bounds. Nor any assumptions about\nthe OPE coefficients were made (apart from their reality, which is again implied by unitarity).\nIn other words, in any unitary 4D CFT, the OPE of any scalar primary \u03c6d must contain at\nleast one scalar field O\u2206 with dimension not larger than f (d).\nIncidentally, the function f (d) was found to satisfy f (1) = 2, which is quite natural since d = 1\ncorresponds to the free field whose OPE contains the operator :\u03c62 : of dimension 2.\nWhat makes the result like (1.3) possible? The basic reason is that, in any theory, crossing\nsymmetry relation of Fig. 1 cannot be satisfied term by term, but only by cancellations among\nvarious terms. The guaranteed presence of the unit operator in the OPE (1.2) creates a certain\n\"crossing symmetry deficit\", which has to be balanced by other fields. The idea is to show that\nthis cannot happen unless at least one scalar of sufficiently low dimension is present.\nTechnically, the method of [7] consists of 3 steps (see Section 3 for a detailed review):\n1. We Taylor-expand the conformal bootstrap equation near the \"self-dual point\" configuration\nhaving equal conformal cross-ratios u = v. The expansion is truncated to a certain finite\norder N .\n2. We systematically search for positivity properties satisfied by linear combinations of Taylor\ncoefficients of the conformal blocks, for fields appearing in the RHS of the OPE (1.2). A\nfound positivity property implies that the \"crossing symmetry deficit\" cannot be balanced\nand rules out a CFT with a given d and \u2206min .\n2\n\n\f3. For fixed d, the bound f (d) is then computed as the point separating those \u2206min for which\na positivity property exists, from those ones for which it does not (Fig. 2).\nThe nature of the method is such that increasing N can make the bound only stronger.The\noptimal bound should in principle be recoverable in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. In practice the value of\nN is determined by the available computer resources and algorithmic efficiency. The best bound\nfound in [7], plotted in Fig. 3, corresponds to N = 6.\n\nf #d$, f ! f6\n\n4.0\n3.5\n3.0\n2.5\n2.0\nd!!\u03a6\"\n1.00 1.05 1.10 1.15 1.20 1.25 1.30 1.35\n\u221a\nFigure 3: The bound f6 (d) ' 2 + 1.79 d \u2212 1 + 2.9(d \u2212 1), 1 \u2264 d \u2264 1.35, corresponding\nto N = 6, reproduced from [7].\nThe purpose of this paper is to present an improvement of the bound (1.3) obtained by using\nthe method of [7] with larger values of N , up to N = 18. The new results are interesting in two\nways. First, pure numerical improvement turns out to be significant. Second, N = 18 happens\nto be large enough so that we start observing saturation of the bound. So we believe our current\nresults are close to the optimal ones achievable with this method.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the conformal bootstrap equations.\nIn Section 3 we review the connection of the bound (1.3).with positivity properties satisfied by the\nconformal block expansion coefficients. In Section 4 we present and discuss our results. We also\nmention accompanying results which we obtain for an analogous problem in 2D. In Section 5 we\npropose several future applications and extensions of our method, with emphasis on connections\nto phenomenology and string theory. In Section 6 we summarize and conclude. In Appendix A\nwe collect some details about our numerical algorithms. In Appendix B we include the tables on\nwhich plots in Section 4 are based.\n\n2\n\nReview of conformal bootstrap\n\nWe will review the conformal bootstrap equation in its simplest form-as applied to the 4-point\nfunction of identical scalars h\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i.

An (yn )i\nprovided that |x| < |yi |, i.e. \u03c6(x) is closer to the origin than any other local field insertion (see\nFig. 4). This assumption can be justified by using radial quantization ([8], Sect. 2.9), and checked\nexplicitly in free field theory. For rigorous mathematical results about OPE convergence see [9].\n3\n\nThe field is called primary if it transforms homogeneously under the 4D conformal group.\nIf there are several primaries with the same \u2206, l, they have to be all included in this sum with independent\ncoefficients.\n4\n\n4\n\n\fY\n\nx4 \u00ae \u00a5\nx2\n\nz\n-0.5\n\n0.5\n\nx1\n\nx3\n\nX\n\nFigure 5: The auxiliary z coordinate.

This representation\nis obtained by using the OPE in the 12 and 34 channels. The conformal blocks g\u2206,l (u, v) sum up\nthe contributions of the primary O\u2206,l and all its descendants. Their explicit expressions were\nfound by Dolan and Osborn [10]:\ng\u2206,l (u, v) =\n\n(\u2212)l z z\u0304\n[ k\u2206+l (z)k\u2206\u2212l\u22122 (z\u0304) \u2212 (z \u2194 z\u0304)] ,\n2l z \u2212 z\u0304\n\nk\u03b2 (x) \u2261 x\u03b2/2 2 F1 (\u03b2/2, \u03b2/2, \u03b2; x) ,\nu = z z\u0304,\n\n(2.4)\n\nv = (1 \u2212 z)(1 \u2212 z\u0304) .\n\nNotice the judicious introduction of the auxiliary variables z and z\u0304. When the theory is formulated in the Euclidean space, these variables are complex-conjugates of each other. To understand\ntheir meaning, it is convenient to use the conformal group freedom to send x4 \u2192 \u221e and to put\nthe other three points in a plane, as in Fig. 5. Then it's easy to show that\nz=\n\n1\n+ X + iY,\n2\n\nz\u0304 = z \u2217 ,\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere (X, Y ) are the coordinates of x2 in the plane, chosen so that X = Y = 0 corresponds to x2\nhalfway between x1 and x3 . This \"self-dual\" configuration, for which u = v, will play an important\nrole below. We can see that the z variable is a natural extension of the usual complex coordinate\nof the 2D CFT to the 4D case.\nAccording to the above discussion, the OPE is expected to converge for |z| < 1. Conformal\nblock decomposition is a partial resummation of the OPE and thus also converges at least in this\n5\n\n\frange. In fact, below we will only use convergence around the self-dual point z = 1/2. However,\nconformal blocks, as given by (2.4), are regular (real-analytic) in a larger region, namely in the\nz-plane with the (1, +\u221e) cut along the real axis (see Fig. 5). The conformal block decomposition\nis thus expected to converge in this larger region. One can check that this indeed happens in the\nfree scalar theory.\nOne can intuitively understand the reason for this extended region of regularity. The condition\nfor the OPE convergence, as stated above, does not treat the points x and 0 symmetrically. On\nthe other hand, the conformal blocks are completely symmetric in x1 \u2194 x2 and so must be\nthe condition for their regularity. The appropriate condition is as follows: the conformal block\ndecomposition in the 12-34 channel is regular and convergent if there is a sphere separating the\npoints x1,2 from the points x3,4 . For the configuration of Fig. 5, such a sphere exists as long as x2\nis away from the cut.\n\n2.2\n\nConformal bootstrap and the sum rule\n\nThe 4-point function in (2.2) must be symmetric under the interchange of any two xi , and its\nconformal block decomposition (2.3) has to respect this symmetry. The symmetry with respect to\nx1 \u2194 x2 or x3 \u2194 x4 is already built in, since only even spins are exchanged [10]. On the contrary,\nthe symmetry with respect to x1 \u2194 x3 gives a condition\nv d g(u, v) = ud g(v, u) ,\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhich is not automatically satisfied for g(u, v) given by (2.3). This nontrivial constraint on dimensions, spins, and OPE coefficients of all operators appearing in the OPE \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6 is known as the\nconformal bootstrap equation. Physically it means that OPE applied in 12-34 and 14-23 channels\nshould give the same result (Fig. 1).\nIn the z-plane of Section 2.1, the LHS of (2.6) has a cut along (1, +\u221e), while the RHS has a\ncut along (\u2212\u221e, 0). Thus, if (2.6) is satisfied, the cuts have to cancel, and the resulting g(u, v) is\nreal analytic everywhere except for z = 0, 1.\nIn [7], we found it useful to rewrite (2.6) by separating the unit operator contribution, which\ngives\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\nud \u2212 v d =\np\u2206,l v d g\u2206,l (u, v) \u2212 ud g\u2206,l (v, u) .\n(2.7)\nThe LHS of this equation is the \"crossing symmetry deficit\" created by the presence of the unit\noperator in the OPE. This deficit has to be balanced by contributions of the other fields in the\nRHS.\nIn practice it is convenient to normalize (2.7) by dividing both sides by ud \u2212 v d . The resulting\nsum rule takes the form:\nX\n1=\np\u2206,l Fd,\u2206,l (X, Y ) ,\nFd,\u2206,l (X, Y ) \u2261\n\nv d g\u2206,l (u, v) \u2212 ud g\u2206,l (v, u)\n.\nud \u2212 v d\n6\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fThe \"F-functions\" Fd,\u2206,l are real and regular in the full z-plane cut along (\u2212\u221e, 0) \u222a (1, +\u221e). In\nparticular, the 0/0 behavior at the self-dual point z = 1/2 is regular.\nAll F-functions vanish near the points z = 0 and z = 1. Thus the sum rule can never be satisfied\nnear these points if only finitely many terms are present in the RHS. The OPEs containing finitely\nmany primaries are ruled out.\n\n3\n\nPositivity argument\n\nThe main idea of [7] was very simple, and can be described as follows. Suppose that for a given\nspectrum of operator dimensions and spins {\u2206, l} the sum rule (2.8), viewed as an equation for\nthe coefficients p\u2206,l \u2265 0, has no solution. Then of course such a spectrum would be ruled out.\nAny concrete realization of this idea needs a practical criterium to show that there is no\nsolution. For a prototypical example of such a criterium, imagine that a certain derivative, e.g.\n\u2202X (see (2.5)), when applied to every Fd,\u2206,l and evaluated at a certain point, is strictly positive\n(\"positivity property\"). Since the same derivative applied to the LHS of (2.8) gives identically\nzero, a solution where all coefficients p\u2206,l are non-negative would clearly be impossible. We refer\nto this simple reasoning as the \"positivity argument\".\nOne can imagine more general criteria using different differential operators, and applying them\nat different points. In [7], we found it convenient to apply differential operators precisely at the\nself-dual point z = 1/2, X = Y = 0. One can show that the F-functions are even with respect to\nthis point both in the X and Y directions:\nF (X, Y ) = F (X, \u2212Y ) = F (\u2212X, Y ).\nThus, all odd-order derivatives vanish, and a sufficiently general differential operator (\"linear\nfunctional\") takes the form:\nX\nm n\n\u039b[F ] =\n\u03bbm,n \u2202X\n\u2202Y F |X=Y =0 ,\n(3.1)\nm,n even\n2\u2264m+n\u2264N\n\nwhere N is some fixed finite number, and \u03bbm,n are fixed real coefficients.5 Notice the exclusion of\nthe constant term m = n = 0, in order to have \u039b[1] = 0.\nAssume that for certain fixed d and \u2206min , we manage to find a linear functional of this form\nsuch that (\"positivity property\")\n\u039b[Fd,\u2206,l ] \u2265 0 for all \u2206 \u2265 \u2206min (l = 0)\nand for all \u2206 \u2265 l + 2 (l = 2, 4, 6 . . .) .\n5\n\n(3.2)\n\nIn [7], we analytically continued to the Minkowski space by Wick-rotating Y \u2192 iT. In this picture z and z\u0304\nare both real and independent, and conformal blocks are real regular functions in the region 0 < z, z\u0304 < 1. For our\npurposes Minkowski and Euclidean pictures are exactly equivalent. In particular, derivatives of F-functions in Y\nand T are trivially proportional to each other.\n\n7\n\n\fMoreover, assume that all but a finite number of these inequalities are actually strict: \u039b[F ] > 0.\nThen the sum rule cannot be satisfied, and such a spectrum, corresponding to a putative OPE\n(1.2), is ruled out.\nThe proof uses the above \"positivity argument\". Since \u039b[1] = 0, the positivity property\nimplies that only those primaries for which \u039b[F ] = 0 would be allowed to appear in the RHS of\nthe sum rule with nonzero coefficients. By assumption, there are at most a finite number of such\nprimaries. However, as noted in Section 2.2, finitely many terms can never satisfy the sum rule\nglobally, because of the behavior near z = 0, 1. Q.E.D.\nWhile the above formal reasoning is quite sufficient to understand our results, in [7] the sum\nrule was also given an alternative interpretation in terms of convex geometry. In this more visual picture, linear combinations of F-functions with arbitrary positive coefficients form a convex\ncone in the space of two-variable functions. One can consider the full function space or its finitedimensional subspace corresponding to Taylor-expanding up to order N. Positivity property (3.2)\nmeans that there is a hyperplane separating the function 1 from the convex cone. Thus it implies that the sum rule cannot be satisfied. The converse is \"almost true\", modulo questions of\nconvergence.\nClearly, the language of linear functionals provides an equivalent, dual formulation of the\nproblem. This formulation is also especially convenient from the point of view of checking our\nresults independently. It's not so important how we find the functionals. As long as we publish\nthe functional coefficients \u03bbm,n , anyone can verify that the inequalities (3.2) are satisfied.\n\n4\n\nResults, discussion, and 2D analogue\n\nAs discussed in Section 1, we are interested in computing an upper bound (1.3) for the dimension\n\u2206min of the leading scalar in the OPE \u03c6d \u00d7 \u03c6d , universal for all unitary 4D CFTs. In [7], we have\ncomputed such a bound in the interval 1 \u2264 d \u2264 1.3, using the sum rule of Section 2.2 truncated\nto the N = 6 derivative order. That bound is reproduced in Fig. 3.\nWe now present the results of our latest study, obtained for larger values of N . These results6\nare plotted in Fig 6 as a collection of curves fN (d), N = 6 . . . 18, where the index N denotes the\nnumber of derivatives used to obtain the bound. The bound naturally gets stronger as N increases\n(see below), and thus the lowest curve f18 (d) is the strongest bound to date. In the considered\ninterval 1 \u2264 d \u2264 1.7 this bound is well approximated (within 0.5%) by\nf18 (d) ' 2 + 0.7\u03b3 1/2 + 2.1\u03b3 + 0.43\u03b3 3/2 ,\n\n\u03b3 = d \u2212 1.\n\n(4.1)\n\nTo obtain the bounds of Fig. 6, we used the positivity argument from [7], as reviewed in Section\n3. Namely, for points lying on the curves \u2206min = fN (d) we are able to find a linear functional of\nthe form (3.1) satisfying the positivity property (3.2).7 The numerical procedure that we use to\nfind these \"positive functionals\" is described in some detail in Appendix A.\n6\n7\n\nSee Appendix B for the same results in tabular form.\nThus actually the bound is strict: \u2206min < fN (d), except at d = 1.\n\n8\n\n\f5.5\n5.0\n\n.18\n\nDmin\n\n4.5\n\ndL,\nf NH\n\n4.0\n\n6..\nN=\n\n3.5\n\n?\nf \u00a5HdL\n\n3.0\n\nd\n\nD min=2\n\n2.5\n2.0\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.5\n\n1.6\n\n1.7\n\nd\n\nFigure 6: Our main results. The solid curves are the bounds fN (d), N = 6 . . . 18.\nThe bounds get stronger as N increases, thus N = 6 is the weakest bound (highest\ncurve), and N = 18 is the current best bound (lowest curve). The shaded region is\nthus excluded. The dashed curve f\u221e (d) is an approximation to the best possible bound,\nobtained by extrapolating N \u2192 \u221e.

The shaded region is excluded.\n\n9\n\n\fSeveral comments are in order here.\n1. We have actually computed the bound only for a discrete number of d values, shown as points\nin Fig. 6. The tables of these computed values are given in Appendix B. Behavior for d \u2192 1\ncan be better appreciated from the logarithmic-scale plot in Fig. 7.\nWe do not see any significant indication which could suggest that the curves fN (d) do\nnot interpolate smoothly in between the computed points. Small irregularities in the slope\nare however visible at several points in Figs. 6,7. These irregularities are understood; they\noriginate from the necessity to discretize the infinite system of inequalities (3.2), see Appendix\nA for a discussion. In our computations the discretization step was chosen so that these\nirregularities are typically much smaller than the improvement of the bound that one gets\nfor N \u2192 N + 2.\n2. For each N the bound fN (d) is near-optimal, in the sense that no positive functional involving\nderivatives up to order N exists for\n\u2206min \u2212 2 < (1 \u2212 \u03b5)[fN (d) \u2212 2].\nWe estimate \u03b5 ' 1% from the analysis of residuals in the fit of fN (d) by a smooth curve like\nin (4.1).\nOn the other hand, by increasing N we are allowing more general functionals, and thus\nthe bound fN (d) can and does get stronger. This is intuitively clear since for larger N the\nTaylor-expanded sum rule includes more and more constraints.\nCompared to the results of [7], the bound on the anomalous dimension \u2206min \u22122 is improved\nby \u223c 30 \u00f7 50% in the range 1 \u2264 d \u2264 1.7 that we explored.\n3. We have pushed our analysis to such large values of N in the hope of seeing that the bound\nsaturates as N \u2192 \u221e. Indeed, we do observe signs of convergence in Figs. 6,7, especially at\nd & 1.1. In fact, we have observed that the bounds fN (d) starting from N = 8 follow rather\nclosely the asymptotic behavior\nfN (d) ' f\u221e (d) +\n\nc(d)\n,\nN2\n\n(1 \u2264 d \u2264 1.7).\n\nAn approximation to the optimal bound f\u221e (d) can thus be found by performing for each d\na fit to this formula. This approximation is shown by a dashed line in Fig. 6. From this\nrough analysis we conclude that the optimal bound on the anomalous dimension \u2206min \u2212 2 is\nprobably within \u223c 10% from our current bound.\n4. We have fN (d) \u2192 2 continuously as d \u2192 1. The point d = 1, \u2206min = 2 corresponds to the\nfree scalar theory.\nWe don't know of any unitary CFTs that saturate our bound at d > 1, see the discussion\nin Section 6 of [7]. We know however a family of unitary 4D CFTs in which \u2206min = 2d and\nwhich are consistent with our bound (the red dotted line in Fig. 6). This \"generalized free\nscalar\" theory is defined for a fixed d by specifying the 2-point function\nh\u03c6(x)\u03c6(0)i = |x|\u22122d ,\n10\n\n\fand defining all other correlators of \u03c6 via Wick's theorem. This simple procedure gives a\nwell-defined CFT, unitary as long as d \u2265 1, which can be described by a nonlocal action\nZ\nS \u221d d4 x \u03c6(\u2202 2 )d \u03c6 .\nThe full operator content of this theory can be recovered by studying the OPE \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6. In\nparticular, the leading scalar in this OPE has dimension 2d.8\n\n4.1\n\n2D analogue\n\nAlthough our main interest is in the 4D CFTs, our methods allow a parallel treatment of the 2D\ncase. The main characteristics of the 2D situation were described in Section 6.1 of [7], here will\nbriefly review them.\n1. At present we can only take advantage of the finite-dimensional SL(2, C) symmetry and not\nof the full Virasoro algebra of the 2D CFTs. In particular, our results are independent of the\n2D central charge c.\n2. The unitarity bounds for SL(2, C) primaries9 in 2D have the form\n\u2206 \u2265 l,\n\nl = 0, 1, 2 . . . ,\n\nwhere l is the Lorentz spin.\n3. The SL(2, C) conformal blocks in 2D are known explicitly [10]:\ng\u2206,l (u, v) =\n\n(\u2212)l\n[ f\u2206+l (z)f\u2206\u2212l (z\u0304) + (z \u2194 z\u0304)] .\n2l\n\n(4.2)\n\nUsing the unitarity bounds, the known conformal blocks, and the sum rule (2.8), valid in\nany dimension, we can try to answer the same question as in 4D. Namely, for a SL(2, C) scalar\nprimary \u03c6 of dimension d, what is an upper bound on the dimension \u2206min of the first scalar\noperator appearing in the OPE \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6? I.e. we want a 2D analogue of the bound (1.3). Since the\nfree scalar is dimensionless in 2D, the region of interest is d > 0.\nFig. 8 summarizes our current knowledge of this bound:10\n\u2022 The dotted line is the old N = 2 bound presented in [7]. The solid line is the N = 12\nimproved bound obtained by us.11 . An numerical fit to this bound is given by:\n\u001a\nd . 0.122 ,\n4.3d + 8d2 \u2212 87d3 + 2300d4 ,\n(2D)\nf12 (d) '\n0.64 + 2.87d,\nd & 0.122 .\n8\n\nThis theory can also be realized holographically by considering a free scalar field of a particular d-dependent\nmass in the AdS geometry and taking the limit in which 5D gravity is decoupled. We are grateful to Kyriakos\nPapadodimas for discussions about the generalized free scalar CFT.\n9\nKnown as quasi-primaries in 2D CFT literature.\n10\nSee Appendix B for the results in tabular form.\n11\nWe are grateful to Erik Tonni for providing us with the large \u2206, l asymptotics of the 2D conformal block\nexpansion coefficients, necessary to obtain this bound.\n\n11\n\n\fClearly, the improvement compared to [7] is significant.\nIt is interesting to note that in 2D we have observed a much faster convergence for increasing N than in 4D. In fact, already with N = 6 it is possible to obtain a bound rather close\nto the one shown in Fig. 8, although with a slightly rounded \"knee\". We have also computed\nseveral points for N = 16 and haven't seen much improvement.\n\u2022 The dashed line and scattered crosses correspond to various OPEs realized in explicit examples of exactly solvable unitary 2D CFTs (minimal models and the free scalar theory), see\n[7]. They all respect our bound.\n\n2.0\nH2 DL Hd L \u0089 \u0089\nf 12 \u0089 \u0089\n\u0089\n\n1.5\nDmin\n\n\u0089\n\n>3L\nm\nH\n\u03a8,\u03a8\n\u00892\n\n1.0\n\nH2 D\nf2\n\nL\n\nHdL\n\n0.5\n\n+\n\nIsing\ne\n\nFre\n\n0.0\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35\nd\nFigure 8: See the text for an explanation. The red cross denotes the position of the\nIsing model, the black crosses marked \u03c8, \u03c8 2 correspond to the OPEs realized in the\nhigher minimal models, as in Fig. 15 of [7]. The shaded region is excluded.\n\nIt is instructive to compare this plot with its 4D counterpart, Fig. 6. While we do not know of\nany CFTs saturating the 4D bound, the 2D unitary minimal models M(m, m + 1), m = 3, 4, . . .,\ncontain the OPEs\n\u03c8 \u00d7 \u03c8 = 1 + \u03c82 + . . . ,\n\n\u2206\u03c8 =\n\n3\n1\n\u2212\n,\n2 2(m + 1)\n\n\u2206\u03c82 = 2 \u2212\n\n4\n,\nm+1\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhich come quite close to saturating the 2D bound.\nMore precisely, our 2D bound starts at (0, 0) tangentially to the line \u2206 = 4d realized in the\nfree scalar theory, then grows monotonically and passes remarkably closely above the Ising model\npoint (\u2206\u03c3 , \u2206\u03b5 ) = (1/8, 1). After a \"knee\" at the Ising point, the bound continues to grow linearly,\npassing in the vicinity of the higher minimal model points (4.3).\n\n12\n\n\fIt is curious to note that if we did not know beforehand about the Ising model, we could have\nconjectured its field dimensions and the basic OPE \u03c3 \u00d7 \u03c3 = 1 + \u03b5 based on the singular behavior\nof the 2D bound at d = 1/8.\nOn the other hand, nothing special happens with the 2D bound at the higher minimal model\npoints, it just interpolates linearly in between12 . Most likely, this does not mean that there exist\nother unitary CFTs with intermediate operator dimensions. Rather, this behavior suggests that\nthe single conformal bootstrap equation used to derive the bound is not powerful enough to fully\nconstrain a CFT.\nIn comparison, it is a bit unfortunate that the 4D bound does not exhibit any singular points\nwhich would immediately stand out as CFT candidates. Nevertheless, if we assume that the shape\nof the 4D bound is a result of an interpolation between existing CFTs (as it is the case in 2D),\nwe may conjecture that the upward convex behavior of the functions fN (d) in Fig. 6 is due to the\npresence of a family of points satisfying the sum rule that can correspond to exact CFTs. This\nobservation, though speculative, shows how the presented method can provide a guideline in the\nstudy of 4D CFTs.\n\n5\n\nFuture research directions\n\nThe results of this paper and of [7] open up many interesting research directions, which we would\nlike to list here.\nFirst, there are several important problems in 4D Conformal Field Theory which can be analyzed by our method and its simple modifications. For example:\n1. One should be able to derive a generalization of our bounds in the situation when the CFT\nhas a global symmetry, and we are interested in the lowest dimension singlet appearing in\nthe OPE. This is going to have phenomenological implications by constraining the so-called\nconformal technicolor scenarios of ElectroWeak Symmetry Breaking [11]. This connection\nwas extensively discussed in [7].\n2. One should be able to derive model-independent bounds on the size of OPE coefficients. This\nis going to be relevant for discussions of 'unparticle self-interactions' [12], in the context of\nunparticle physics scenarios [13].\nSecond, the method can also be used in 2D Conformal Field Theory, as was already demonstrated in Section 4.1. The main interest here lies in potential applications to string theory. We\nwill now briefly describe two such applications.\nPhysical states of (super)string theory are in 1-1 correspondence with Virasoro primary operators of a 2D CFT living on the string worldsheet. The mass of a string state (in string units) is\n12\n\nThe straight line fitting the bound would cross the dashed Free theory line just above d = 0.5, which is the\naccumulation point of the minimal models M(m, m + 1). For larger values of d we expect that the bound modifies\nits slope and eventually asymptotes to the Free line.\n\n13\n\n\frelated to the corresponding primary operator dimension \u2206 via\nm2 = \u2206 \u2212 2 .\nWe are considering closed string theory for concreteness. When strings propagate in flat space,\nthe CFT is solvable and the full spectrum of operator dimensions is known. Realistic string\nconstructions require compactifications of extra dimensions. In some examples, such as toroidal\ncompactifications, the CFT is still solvable. In others, such as superstring compactifications on\na generic Calabi-Yau three-fold, the CFT cannot be solved exactly. All what is generally known\nis the spectrum of the massless states, which can be obtained in the supergravity approximation.\nOf course we expect the massive string states to be always present, but just how heavy can\nthey be? We know from the experience with toroidal compactifications that it is impossible to\ncompletely decouple the massive states: as the compactification radius R \u2192 0, the Kaluza-Klein\nstates become more massive, but the winding modes come down. Clearly, massive string states\nare crucial for the consistency of the theory. What exactly are they doing? A partial answer may\nbe that without their presence, 4-point functions of the massless state vertex operators would not\nbe crossing-symmetric. If this intuition is right, it could be used to obtain model-independent\nbounds on the lightest massive states in string compactifications, generalizing the well-known\nbounds valid for toroidal compactifications. A similar in spirit general prediction of string gravity,\nalthough in a different context and by using different methods, was obtained recently in [14].\nWhen working towards results of this kind, it may be necessary to generalize our methods so\nthat the information about the 2D CFT central charge, which is fixed in string theory, can be\ntaken into account. In practice, one needs an efficient method to evaluate the full Virasoro conformal blocks. While no closed-form expression as simple as Eq. (4.2) is known, Zamolodchikov's\nexpansion (see [6]) can probably be applied.\nFinally, as mentioned above in the 4D context, it should be possible to derive model-independent\nbounds on the OPE coefficients. Such results must be accessible via a simple modification of our\nmethod, in particular the full Virasoro conformal blocks are not needed here. One can then apply\nsuch bounds to the dimension 2 operators corresponding to the massless string states (in an arbitrary compactification). Via the usual dictionary, this would then translate into general bounds\non the tree-level coupling constants in the low-energy string effective actions.\n\n6\n\nSummary\n\nPrime principles of Conformal Field Theory, such as unitarity, OPE, and conformal block decomposition, imply the existence of an upper bound f (d) on the dimension \u2206min of the leading scalar\noperator in the OPE \u03c6 \u00d7 \u03c6, which depends only on \u03c6's dimension d.\nMoreover, there is an efficient method which allows numerical determination of f (d) with\narbitrary desired accuracy. The method is based on the sum rule, a function-space identity\nsatisfied by the conformal block decomposition of the 4-point function h\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6i, which follows from\nthe crossing symmetry constraints. In practical application of the method the sum rule is Taylorexpanded: replaced by finitely many equations for the derivatives up to a certain order N . The\n14\n\n\fbound f (d) improves monotonically as more and more derivatives are included. In [7], where the\nabove paradigm was first developed, we numerically computed the bound for N = 6.\nThe present paper extended the study of [7] to higher N. The goals were to improve the bound,\nand perhaps to approach the best-possible bound in case a convergence of the bound is observed.\nOur analysis went up to N = 18, see Fig. 6, and we have achieved both goals. First, in the\nrange 1 \u2264 d \u2264 1.7 that we explored, the bound on the anomalous dimension \u2206min \u2212 2 is improved\nby 30 \u00f7 50% compared to the results of [7]. Second, we do observe signs of convergence of the\nbound. We believe that our current results are close (within \u223c 10%) to the best ones achievable\nwith this method.\nThe results of this paper and of [7] suggest several interesting research directions, connected\nwith phenomenology and, via the 2D analogue of our method, with string theory (see Section 5).\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to J.

We will\nfirst describe the general procedure and how it can implemented in a computer code, and then\nmention possible algorithmic improvements and shortcuts that we found useful in our analysis.\nGiven the complexity of the functions Fd,\u2206,l , the search for a positive functional is too hard a\ntask to be attacked analytically. As already mentioned, we reduce the complexity of the problem\nby looking for a functional which is a linear combination of derivatives up to a given order N .\nThe derivative are taken w.r.t. the selfdual point X = Y = 0, since the sum rule is expected to\nconverge fastest around this point and, in addition, the functions Fd,\u2206,l (X, Y ) are even in both\narguments. The choice of the functional (3.1) simplifies our task enormously since we can now\nwork in a finite dimensional space, and the only information concerning Fd,\u2206,l that we need are\ntheir derivatives up to a certain order. Put another way, the F-functions are now considered as\n15\n\n\felements not of a function space but of a finite-dimensional vector space Rs , s = N (N + 6)/8.\nThe sum rule (2.8) in this picture represents a constraints on these vectors that, in any CFT,\nmust sum to zero. This interpretation is discussed in details in [7]. Here we adopt an equivalent\npoint of view in terms of the dual space of linear functionals defined on Rs since we find this\nprospective closer to the method used to obtain numerically \u039b[F ].\nLet us fix the notation. We define the s-dimensional vector of Taylor coefficients:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n(m,n)\nF\n| m, n even, 2 \u2264 m + n \u2264 N ,\nF0 [d, \u03b4, l] \u2261\nm!n! d,\u2206,l\n(m,n)\n\nm n\nFd,\u2206,l \u2261 \u2202X\n\u2202Y Fd,\u2206,l |X=Y =0 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\n\u03b4 \u2261 \u2206 \u2212 l \u2212 2,\n\nand the same vector normalized to the unit length:\nF[d, \u03b4, l] \u2261\n\nF0\n,\nkF0 k\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere the norm kF0 k is the usual Euclidean length of the vector F0 .\nWe form the vector F0 out of the Taylor coefficients of the function Fd,\u2206,,l rather then of\nits derivatives, because this way all elements turn out to have approximately the same order of\nmagnitude, which is preferable in the subsequent numerical computation. The definition of the\nnormalized vector F serves the same purpose. Indeed, as explained in the following, our numerical\nanalysis consist in finding a solution of a system of linear inequalities where the coefficient are\ngiven by the elements of F[d, \u03b4, l]. The solution is more accurate and easier to extract if all the\ncoefficient are of the same order of magnitude. Since the existence of the functional \u039b is not\naffected by these rescalings, we opted for the definition (A.1), (A.2).\nAccording to the positivity property we look for a functional which is strictly positive on all\nbut finitely many vectors F[d, \u03b4, l]. Let us fix the dimension d of the scalar \u03c6d . Then each pair\n\u2206 , l identifies the semi-space of (Rs )\u2217 of the functionals positive-definite on the vectors F[d, \u03b4, l];\nlet us call this open sets Ud,\u2206,l . With this notation the positivity property (3.2) can be restated\nin the following way: If for fixed d and \u2206min\n\\\nUd,\u2206,l 6= \u2205 ,\n(A.3)\n\u2206\u2265\u2206min , l=0\n\u2206\u2265l+2, l=2,4,...\n\nthen the sum rule cannot be satisfied. The issue is thus to be able to check whether the intersection\n(A.3) is non-empty, and to compute the smallest \u2206min for which this is the case.\nClearly it is not possible nor needed to check all the values of \u2206 as required by the condition\n(A.3). We can indeed consider only a finite number of them and check if they admit the existence\nof a functional or not. This can be achieved with a double simplification. First, we consider values\nof \u2206 and l only up to a given maximum value (\"truncation\"), and secondly, we discretize the kept\nrange of \u2206 (\"discretization\"). The truncation does not produce a loss of information since we\ntake into account the large \u2206 and l contributions using the asymptotic expressions computed in\nAppendix D of [7]. The discretization step requires special care, see below.\n16\n\n\fWe used Mathematica 7 to perform the computations. The algorithm to extract the smallest\nvalue of \u2206min proceeds in several steps:\n1. Setting up an efficient procedure to compute vectors F[d, \u03b4, l].\n2. Selection of the l's and \u03b4's to be used in checking the positivity property (A.3). For concreteness we report here the range of l, \u03b4 that we were including:13\n2 \u2264 l \u2264 lmax = 50 :\n0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 200 ,\nl=0:\n\u03b4min \u2261 \u2206min \u2212 2 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 200.\n\n(A.4)\n\nFor each l the range of \u03b4 was discretized, and a discrete set of points was chosen, called \u0393l\nbelow. The derivatives of the F-functions approach zero as \u03b4 \u2192 \u221e and reach the asymptotic\nbehavior for sufficiently large values. We take a finer discretization where the function are\nsignificantly varying while we can allow to increase the step in the asymptotic region. More\ndetails are given below.\n3. Reduction to a Linear Programming problem. With only a finite number of equations to\ncheck, the determination of the intersection of the Ud,\u2206,l becomes a standard problem of\nLinear Programming which can be solved in finite amount of time. Hence we look for a\nsolution of the linear system of inequalities\nX\n\u03bb\u0303m,n Fm,n \u2265 0 ,\n(A.5)\n\u039b[F[d, \u03b4, l]] \u2261\n\u03b4 \u2208 \u0393l ,\n\nl = 0 . . . lmax .\n\nClearly, the coefficients \u03bb\u0303m,n are related to those appearing in (3.1) by a trivial rescaling\ndepending on m, n:\n\u03bb\u0303m,n = m!n!\u03bbm,n\nFurther, the asymptotic behavior of the F-functions (see below) tells us that for large \u03b4 the\ninequality is dominated by the (N, 0) derivative\n(N,0)\n\n\u039b[Fd,\u2206,l ] \u2212\u2192 \u03bb\u0303N,0 Fd,\u2206,l\n\n(\u03b4 \u001d l \u001d 1),\n\n(A.6)\n\nhence \u03bb\u0303N,0 needs to be positive. By an overall rescaling of \u039b we can always achieve\n\u03bb\u0303N,0 = 1 ,\n\n(A.7)\n\nwhich we choose as a normalization condition.\n4. Extraction of the smallest \u2206min for which a positive functional exists. We begin by selecting\ntwo points \u03b4min = \u03b41 and \u03b4min = \u03b42 > \u03b41 (see (A.4)) such that we know a priori that in the first\ncase a positive functional does not exists, while in the second case it does14 . Starting from\n13\n\nIn some cases 2 < l < 200 was needed to obtain a functional which would later pass the positivity check on\nthe non-included values of l, see below.\n14\nWe can choose these points blindly as \u03b41 = 0, \u03b42 \u001d 1, however prior experience can suggest a choice closer to\nthe final \u03b4min\n\n17\n\n\fthese values we apply the bisection method to determine the critical \u03b4min up to the desired\nprecision: we test if a functional exists for \u03b4min = (\u03b42 + \u03b41 )/2 and we increase or decrease the\nextremes of the interval [\u03b41 , \u03b42 ] depending on the outcome. The procedure we follow is such\nthat in the end the critical \u03b4min is contained in an interval of relative width 10\u22123 , i.e. we\nterminate if \u03b42 \u2212 \u03b41 \u2264 10\u22123 \u03b41 . The plots and the tables presented in this work correspond to\nthe upper end \u03b42 of the final interval, i.e. to the the end for which we have found a functional.\nLet us now come back to the point 1. Although computation of the derivatives can be carried on\nby brute force Taylor-expanding the F-functions, we can save time decomposing the computation\nin various blocks. From equation (2.8) we see the rather simple dependence on the parameter d,\nwhich translates in a polynomial dependence once the function is Taylor-expanded in X and Y .\nWe therefore separately computed the dependence on d once and for all as a matrix M (d)mn|ij . To\ncompute Taylor coefficients of F-functions, this matrix is contracted with two vectors containing\none-dimensional Taylor coefficients of the function k\u03b2 (x), see (2.4). The latter derivatives are\npre-computed for several values of \u03b2 with a fine step and stored. For definiteness we report the\ninterval we used:\n0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 102\nstep: 10\u22123 .\n(A.8)\nFor larger \u03b2 we made use of the analytic expression of the asymptotics instead of computing the\nderivatives numerically (see below).\nFinally let us discuss the choice of the discretization and the truncation in \u2206 and l. This step\nis of fundamental importance in order to reduce the time needed to perform the computation.\nIn Appendix D of [7] it is shown that for large values of \u03b4 and l the functions Fd,\u2206,l approach\nan asymptotic behavior. We have checked that outside the range of values (A.4) we can safely use\nthe approximate expression\n\u221a\n(l + \u03b4)m+1 ln+1\n(m,n)\n,\nFd,\u2206,l \u223c const.(2 2)m+n+2\n(m + 1)(n + 1)\nFor large l, \u03b4 the vector F[d, \u03b4, l] is dominated by the components where m+n assumes the highest\nallowed value N . Hence we can take into account this large l, \u03b4 behavior imposing additional\nconstraints:\n(\n(cos \u03b8+sin \u03b8)m+1 cos \u03b8n+1\n\u03b4\nif m + n = N\n(m+1)(n+1)\n\u039b[F\u03b8 ] \u2265 0 ,\nF\u03b8 =\n,\ntan \u03b8 \u2261 ,\nl\n0\notherwise\nwhere we have dropped irrelevant positive constants not depending on m , n.\nNow comes the discretization: in the range of values (A.4), as well as in the interval \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2],\nwe can allow to take only a discrete, finite number of points. For \u03b8 we take a fixed small step.\nHowever, for \u03b4 we try to concentrate the points in the region where the unit vector F[d, \u03b4, l] is\nsignificantly varying. A measure of this is given by the norm of its derivative w.r.t. \u03b4:15\nN =\n15\n\n\u2202\nF[d, \u03b4, l] .\n\u2202\u03b4\n\nIn practice the derivative \u2202/\u2202\u03b4 is evaluated by using the finite-difference approximation.\n\n18\n\n\fWe discretize by taking the spacing between two consecutive values of \u03b4 equal c/N , where c is a\nsmall fixed number (c = 0.02\u00f70.05 was typically taken in our work). Clearly when the unit vector\nis slowly varying the discretization step is large, while it is refined where it is changing rapidly,\nand where presumably more information is encoded. Typically we get about a hundred \u03b4 values\nfor each l, but only a few dozen of those above \u03b4 > 50.\nThe sets \u0393l , one for each l, of values of \u03b4 obtained in this way are the ones referred to at\npoint 2 above. In constructing the linear system that we use at point 3 we consider additional\nintermediate points between two subsequent \u03b4's. In order to understand why we do this, let us\nassume that we have found a functional \u039b which is positive for all the values of \u03b4 contained in \u0393l .\nSince we considered a discrete set of values, it may and actually does happen that for intermediate\nvalues of \u03b4 (which were not included in \u0393l ) the functional becomes slightly negative. In [7] this\nissue was solved looking for solution of the form \u039b[Fd,\u2206,l ] > \u03b5, so that for intermediate values this\ncondition could be violated but the positivity was safe. In the current work we found it more\nconvenient to build the linear system in the following way:\n\u2022 for each \u03b4 \u2208 \u0393l = {\u03b41 , ...., \u03b4i , \u03b4i+1 , ....} we evaluate the vector F[d, \u03b4, l].\n\u2022 for any two consecutive points \u03b4i , \u03b4i+1 , we consider the first-order Taylor expansion of the\nvector F[d, \u03b4, l] around \u03b4 = \u03b4i and evaluate it at half-spacing between \u03b4i and \u03b4i+1 :15\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4i+1 \u2212 \u03b4i \u2202\nF[d, \u03b4i , l]\n(A.9)\nF1/2 [d, \u03b4i , l] \u2261 F[d, \u03b4i , l] +\n2\n\u2202\u03b4\nand we add the constraints \u039b[F1/2 ] \u2265 0 to the linear system (A.5).\nThese additional constraints become important to keep the functional positive near the \u03b4's for\nwhich the inequalities \u039b[F] \u2265 0 are close to saturation, while they are redundant away from those\npoints. Indeed, assume that for some \u03b4i and \u03b4i+1 the functional is exactly vanishing. Then at the\nintermediate point the functional would be strictly negative, which is not allowed. However, in\nthe presence of the additional constraint \u039b[F1/2 ] \u2265 0 this cannot happen, since \u039b[F] is generically\na convex function of \u03b4 near the minimum. See Figure 9 for an illustration. Thus we can be certain\nthat the found functional will be positive also for those \u03b4 which were not included into \u0393l .\nThis certainty has a price. Namely, the opposite side of the coin is that the added F1/2\nconstraints are somewhat stronger than needed, and the bigger the discretization parameter c,\nthe bigger the difference. As a result, the found critical value of \u2206min will be somewhat above\nthe optimal critical value, corresponding to c \u2192 0. This observation explains why the curves\nin Figs. 6,7 have small irregularities in the slope. These irregularities could be decreased by\ndecreasing the value of c.\nSeveral comments concerning the numerical accuracy are in order. The components of the\nvector F[d, \u03b4, l] have been computed using standard double-precision arithmetic (16 digits). As a\nconsequence all the numerical results must be rounded to this precision. In particular, quantities\nsmaller that 10\u221216 are considered zero.\nIn addition, the built-in Mathematica 7 function LinearProgramming, which we used, has\nan undocumented Tolerance parameter. Most of the computations were done with Tolerance\n19\n\n\fL@F @d,\u2206,lDD\n\nL@F @d,\u2206,lDD\n\n\u2206i\n\n\u2206i+1\nnot included\n\n\u2206\n\u2206i\n\nincluded\n\u2206i+1\n\n\u2206\n\nFigure 9: Imposing the positivity of the functional on a discrete set of points, it could\nhappens that the intermediate points don't satisfy \u039b[F[d, \u03b4, l]] \u2265 0 (on the left). However\nadding the constraint \u039b[F1/2 [d, \u03b4i , l]] \u2265 0, see (A.9), we can be sure that the functional\nis positive on all the neglected points (on the right).\n\nequal 10\u22126 (default value). However for N = 16 and N = 18, and for d < 1.1, we found that\nLinearProgramming terminates prematurely, concluding that no positive linear functional exists,\neven for some values of \u03b4min for which a positive functional for smaller N was in fact found. The\nproblem disappeared once we set Tolerance to a lower value (10\u221212 ). In our opinion, Tolerance is\nprobably the so-called pivot tolerance, the minimal absolute value of a number in the pivot column\nof the Simplex Method to be considered nonzero. Recall that a nonzero (actually negative) pivot\nelement is necessary in each step of the Simplex Method [15]. This interpretation explains why\nthe above problem could occur, and why it could be overcome by lowering Tolerance.\nAs described above, our numerical procedure has been designed to be robust with respect to\nthe effects of truncation and discretization. In addition, for each d, we have tested the last found\nfunctional (i.e. for \u03b4min at the upper end \u03b42 of the final interval [\u03b41 , \u03b42 ]) on the much bigger set of\n\u03b4, l:\n2 \u2264 l \u2264 500 , 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 500 , step = 0.1 ,\nl = 0 , \u03b4min \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 500 , step = 0.1 ,\n\n(A.10)\n\nand found that indeed \u039b[F] \u2265 0, within the declared 10\u221216 accuracy.\nFinally, we have checked that in all cases the found functionals \u039b are such that the inequality\n\u039b[F] \u2265 0 is in fact strict: \u039b[F] > 0, for all but finitely many values of \u03b4 and l. Thus they satisfy\nthe requirements stated in Section 3.\n\nB\n\nTables\n\nTable 1 contains the sequence of 4D bounds fN (d), N = 6 . . . 18, for a discrete set of points in the\n(2D)\ninterval 1 < d \u2264 1.7.
