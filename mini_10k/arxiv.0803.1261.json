Using\nanalogies between genes on chromosomes and one-dimensional gases, we\nconstructed a statistical null model. We have used this to estimate typical upstream and downstream regulatory sequence sizes in various species.\nDeviations from this model reveal bi-directional transcriptional regulatory\nregions in S. cerevisiae and bi-directional terminators in E. coli.\n\n1\n\nProbability distributions of intergenic distances\n\nThe probability distributions of intergenic distances are shaped by stochastic processes,\nsuch as insertions, deletions, inversions and duplications, and by natural selection. Although the former tends to randomize the distribution, the latter introduces biases if there\nare functional reasons for genes to be spaced in a particular way [1]. Here we compare\ndata of both Escherichia coli and different fungal species to a statistical mechanics model\nto study which features can be explained by random processes only, and which require an\nexplanation in terms of functionality.\n\n2\n\nThe Constant-Force model\n\nThe Constant-Force (CF) model is based on two observations (see Fig. 1). First, open\nreading frames (ORFs) usually do not overlap, even if their density is high. For example,\nif the genes of Saccharomyces cervisiae (budding yeast) were randomly distributed, 78%\nof the ORFs would overlap with another ORF, whereas in reality, only 9% do.\nSecond, ORFs are rarely very close together (e.g. see Fig. 2a for S. cerevisiae).

This model assumes that a 5'-UTR, a basal promoter\nand a cis-regulatory region are present upstream of every ORF. We call this the upstream\ncontrol region (UCR), and assume it has a fixed size \u03c0 . Downstream of each ORF, the 3'UTR and possibly a transcriptional terminator and RNA processing signals are present, to\nwhich we jointly refer as the downstream control region (DCR), assumed to have length \u03c4 .\nThe figure shows that ORFs neighboring on the DNA can have three mutual orientations:\ndivergent (D), tandem (T) or convergent (C). This also leads to three kinds of intergenic\nregions: D regions contain two UCRs, while T regions contain one UCR and one DCR,\nand C regions have two DCRs. In S. cerevisiae, the frequencies of D, T and C regions are\n26.3%, 48.3% and 25.4% respectively, which is close to the random proportions 1:2:1. This\nholds for most fungi. In E. coli, T regions are more frequent due to the organization of its\ngenes in operons (17.5%, 66.7% and 15,7%).\n\n2\n\n\f0.01\n\n0.004\n\n0.012\n\nExponential fit\nAll\n\n0.001\n\nExponential fit\nAll\n\n0.001\n\nprobability\n\n0.003\n\n0.002\n\n1e-05\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\na\n\n800\n\n1000 1200 1400\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nb\n\n1400\n\nData Convergent\nCF Model Convergent\nData Tandem\nCF Model Tandem\n\n0.003\n\n0.002\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nConvergent\nDivergent\nTandem\nExp. fit\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\nData Divergent\nCF Model Divergent\n\n0.003\n\n0.002\n\n0.001\n\nc\n\n200\n\n0.004\n\nConvergent\nDivergent\nTandem\n\n0.001\n\nprobability\n\n0.0001\n\n0.008\n\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nd\n\n1400\n\ndistance (bp)\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\n\ndistance (bp)\n\nFigure 2: Probability distributions of intergenic distances in S. cerevisiae and E. coli.\n(a) Probability distributions of intergenic regions in S. cerevisiae. The distributions of\ndistances between convergent (C), divergent (D) and tandem (T) gene pairs. C intergenic\nregions are, on average, shorter than T regions; the D regions are longest. Note also that\nthe divergent distribution has a bimodal shape, with a peak at n \u2248 275 bp and one at\nn \u2248 500 bp. Inset: the distribution of all intergenic regions is exponential for distances\nlarger than 300 bp (scale parameter: 335 bp), but has a \"dip\" at shorter distances. This\ndip, we argue, is a footprint of UCRs and DCRs. (b) As panel (a), but for E. coli. The\nT distribution in the main plot is exponential, except for an accumulation in the first\nbin. This accumulation is the result of intergenic regions inside operons, which are not\nseparated by control regions and therefore can be arbitrarily close together [2]. The C\ndistribution is also exponential, except for a peak at 20\u201360 bp, where S. cerevisiae has a\ndip instead. We predict that this peak is the result of bi-directional terminator sequences.\nThe inset again shows that the distribution of all intergenic regions is largely exponential\n(scale parameter: 145 bp ). (c) Simultaneous fit of the Constant Force (CF) model to the\nC and T distributions of S. cerevisiae. The model fits the data surprisingly well. (d) The\nD distribution of S. cerevisiae and the expected distribution according to the CF model.\nClearly, the bi-modal shape of the data is not consistent with the CF model. We predict\nthat the set of divergent intergenic regions in S. cerevisiae consists of two subpopulations:\nthose containing two independent cis-regulatory regions, responsible for the second peak,\nand those containing one bi-directional cis-regulatory region.\n3\n\n\fof the ORFs, which we call upstream and downstream control regions (UCRs and DCRs).\nUCRs include basal promoters, cis-regulatory regions and 5' untranslated regions (UTRs);\nDCRs consist of 3'-UTRs, transcriptional terminators and RNA-processing signals. If\nORFs approach each other closely, these regions need either to overlap or to be very short,\nwhich makes such configurations less likely. To test this, we divide the intergenic regions\ninto three subsets, called tandem (T), convergent (C) and divergent (D). (See Fig. 1.)\nIntergenic regions in subset T should contain one DCR and one UCR, whereas C and D\nintergenic regions contain two DCRs and two UCRs respectively. As UCR sequences are\ngenerally longer than DCRs, we expect that D regions are on average longer than T regions\nand C regions are shortest, which is indeed the case (see Fig. 2a and supplementary Fig.\n3).\nThese observations inspire the following model. We assume that all ORF configurations\nare equally probable, except for the following constraints: (i) ORFs do not overlap; (ii)\nUCRs and DCRs can overlap with each other or with ORFs, but every overlapping base\npair (bp) in a particular configuration makes this configuration a factor q less probable.\nFor simplicity, we assume that in a given organism all UCRs and DCRs have a fixed length,\n\u03c0 and \u03c4 respectively.\nThis model is equivalent to a one-dimensional system of hard particles with a finiteranged, repulsive, constant-force interaction. Tandem, convergent and divergent ORF pairs\ninteract at a range \u03c0 + \u03c4 , 2\u03c4 and 2\u03c0 , respectively. This mapping enables us to use the\nformalism of statistical physics to compute the probability distributions corresponding to\nthis model analytically (see the supplementary material).\n\n3\n\nThe CF model fits the C and T distribution of S. cerevisiae\n\nThe CF model fits the distributions of S. cerevisiae convergent and tandem intergenic\ndistances remarkably well (see Fig. 2c). The fit parameters are \u03c4 = 61 bp for DCRs and\n\u03c0 = 196 bp for UCRs. These numbers provide a course estimate of the space required for\nthe transcriptional and translational regulatory signals and RNA processing in S. cerevisiae.\nOur UCR length prediction of 196 bp is in excellent agreement with the distribution\nof transcription-factor-binding sites near S. cerevisiae start codons, which has its peak\nat 100-200bp from the start codon [3]. Our DCR prediction of 61 bp is supported by\nbioinformatics analyses of S. cerevisiae 3'-RNA processing signals, which show that the\nmajority of these sequences is within 20\u201390 bp of the stop codon [4]. However, Graber et\nal. predict longer 3'-UTRs [5] and recent experiments show that the median of 3'-UTRs\nlengths is \u2248 91 bp [6], which suggests that our DCR estimate is on the low side. (In\nthe supplementary material, we show that more refined models can provide quantitative\nagreement).\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nTypical UCR and DCR sizes for other fungi\nName of organism\nS. cerevisiae\nC. glabrata\nK. lactis\nD. hansenii\n\nUCR length/bp\n196 \u00b1 4\n296 \u00b1 4\n295 \u00b1 5\n141 \u00b1 4\n\nDCR length/bp\n61 \u00b1 1\n66 \u00b1 2\n38 \u00b1 2\n28 \u00b1 2\n\nq\n0.985 \u00b1 0.001\n0.983 \u00b1 0.001\n0.987 \u00b1 0.001\n0.976 \u00b1 0.001\n\nTable 1: Estimates for the UCR and DCR sizes for various fungal species. The errors\ngiven in the table are the uncertainties of the fit parameters and as such should not be\ninterpreted as variances of these quantities in the genome.\nWe repeated this approach to estimate the UCR and DCR lengths for three additional\nfungi using only the ORF coordinates as input. (See Table 1 and Fig. 4 in the supplementary material). We found that UCRs are consistently longer than DCRs. The UCR\nand DCR lengths seem to vary independently of each other, and no dependence on gene\ndensity is apparent. Recently, it has been shown that the distribution of rigid DNA in\ncis-regulatory regions of fungi correlates with the position of transcription-factor-binding\nsites [7]. Our estimates for the UCR lengths correlate well with the position of rigid DNA\nin these fungi.\n\n5\n\nS. cerevisiae contains many bi-directional UCRs\n\nWe now turn to the spacing of divergent pairs in budding yeast. Interestingly, the corresponding distribution has a bimodal shape (see Fig. 2d) that is even more pronounced in\nother fungi (Fig. 3 in the supplementary material). The first, narrow peak is centered on\nbp; the second peak is broader and is maximal around bp. This shape is not consistent\nwith the CF model.\nApparently, many divergent intergenic regions are very short: 29% are < 300 bp.\nBecause few (10%, 280 out of 2801) tandem intergenic regions, containing only one UCR,\nare < 200 bp, it seems unlikely that two independent UCRs could fit in divergent intergenic\nregions with a length of the order of 275 bp. Hence we propose that the set of divergent\ngene pairs is composed of two sub-populations.\nThe first population, corresponding to the second peak, consists of pairs of genes that\nare regulated independently. The other sub-population consists of gene pairs that share a\nbi-directional cis-regulatory region, that is, a regulatory region containing elements such as\ntranscription factor binding sites that regulate the expression of both flanking genes. Such\na coupling could force genes to preserve their proximity, thus causing the deviation from\nthe CF model. While bi-directional cis-regulatory regions are ubiquitous in E. coli [1],\nonly a few bi-directional UCRs have been reported in S. cerevisiae [8, 9, 10, 11]. Based on\n\n5\n\n\fFig. 2d, we predict that about 30% (426 out of 1471) of the divergent pairs are regulated\nby a shared cis-regulatory region. (We list the best candidates in the Supplement.)\nIf this is true, then one would expect co-expressed divergent pairs to be overrepresented\nin the first peak rather than the second. This is indeed the case for positively correlated\npairs ( p < 0.002; see Supplement, section D.1). Negatively correlated pairs are typically\nnot in the first peak. This contrasts with bi-directional UCRs in bacteria, in which dual\nregulators often act as a repressor for one of the genes and as an activator for the other,\nresulting in anti-correlated expression patterns.\nWe also used Gene Ontology (GO) annotations [12] to test whether the divergent neighbors in the first peak are more often functionally related than those in the second peak.\nAdopting the method of reference [13] to quantify the similarity between GO terms, we\nindeed found this to be the case (p < 9 \u00d7 10\u22124 for biological process, p < 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 for\ncellular component; see Supplement, section D.2).\n\n6\n\nE. coli has many bi-directional terminators\n\nAs mentioned above, bi-directional promoters are well-characterized in E. coli. We now\nshow that the distribution of convergent gene pairs in E. coli provides evidence for bidirectional transcriptional terminators, which are much less well described.\nIn accordance with the CF model, the C distribution has an exponential signature (see\nFig. 2b). Convergent intergenic regions are expected to contain two DCRs. Given the\ntypical size of Rho-independent terminators ( \u2248 40 bp) the CF model predicts a dip at\nshort distances ( < 80 bp). Instead, there is a significant excess of intergenic regions of size\n20 to 60 bp (p = 10\u221213 ; see Supplement, section D.3). It is unlikely that two terminators\nwould fit into such short intergenic regions.\nRho-independent terminator sequences function by stem-loop formation of the RNA\ntranscript, and hence are largely palindromic. As the complementary strand of a palindromic sequence is a palindrome too, some terminators can function bi-directionally. Indeed, a few bi-directional terminators have been identified experimentally [14]. Moreover,\nLesnik et al. used an algorithm called RNAMotif to identify putative terminators and predicted that many of them could function bi-directionally [2]. Given that most terminators\nin E. coli start within 60 bp downstream of their ORF [2], genes sharing a bi-directional\nterminator should usually be close together; this suggests that the peak in the distribution\nat short distances is caused by bi-directional terminators.\nTo explain the data, at least 86 bi-directional terminators should be present; this would\nimply that as many as 23% of the operons use a bi-directional terminator (see Supplement,\nsection D.3).\nWe tested this, using the data of Lesnik et al.1 . Indeed, putative terminators that\nRNAMotif classifies as bi-directional have a tendency to occur in short, convergent inter1\n\nAlthough no statistical test is presented, a similar conclusion is reached in ref. [15]\n\n6\n\n\fgenic regions, corroborating our hypothesis (p < 0.0003, see Supplement, sections D.4 and\nD.5) [16].\n\n7\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nThe largest limitation of the current model is the assumption that the UCRs and DCRs\nhave fixed sizes. Especially in higher eukaryotes, UCR and DCR lengths often have a high\nvariance; in these cases, it is necessary to include this in the model. In the Supplement we\nshow that this can be done and how more realistic potentials can be chosen.\nThat being said, the simple CF model describes many universal characteristics of the\ngene spacing. It not only quantitatively describes the exponential decay at large distances,\nbut also the repulsion at short distances due to UCRs and DCRs in prokaryotes and\neukaryotes alike. In E. coli and fungi, this repulsion provides information about the typical\nlength of UCRs and DCRs using only the ORFs coordinates as input. The model can also\nserve as a null model for the spacing of genes: deviations from it lead to meaningful\npredictions about the presence of operons, bi-directional promoters or terminators.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Andre Boorsma and Harmen Bussemaker for providing the yeast expression data.\nThis work is part of the research program of the \"Stichting voor Fundamenteel Onderzoek\nder Materie (FOM)\", which is financially supported by the \"Nederlandse organisatie voor\nWetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)\".\n\n7\n\n\fSupplementary Text\nA\n\nThe Constant Force Model\n\nIn this section we provide additional information about the Constant-Force (CF) model.\n\nA.1\n\nAssumptions\n\nAs we explained in the main text, the CF model is based on three assumptions. First, we\nassume that ORFs cannot overlap. Second, in a given organism, upstream control regions\n(UCRs) and downstream control regions (DCRs) have a fixed size (\u03c0 and \u03c4 respectively).\nThird, we assume that these control regions can overlap with each other and with nearby\nORFs, but that such overlaps are not likely. More precisely, we assume that whenever a\nbase pair from such a region overlaps with another functional region, be it an ORF, a UCR\nor a DCR, it makes that particular configuration a factor q less probable. For simplicity,\nwe make no distinction between the different kinds of overlap.\nA useful analogy can be drawn with a physical system. The proposed model is formally\nequivalent to a one-dimensional system of hard particles with finite-ranged repulsive interactions. The interaction determined by our assumptions is an interaction with a constant\nforce. The range of the interaction depends on the mutual orientation of the neighboring\ngenes. Divergent gene pairs are separated by two UCRs and therefore start interacting\nat a distance 2\u03c0; convergent pairs have two DCRs in their intergenic region and therefore\nhave an interaction range of 2\u03c4 , and intergenic regions between tandem pairs contain one\nDCR and one UCR (interaction range \u03c0 + \u03c4 ). This analogy allows us to use the formalism\nof statistical physics to compute the probability distribution of the intergenic distances for\nthis model analytically; the complete derivation follows below.\n\nA.2\n\nDerivation of the distance distributions:\nCF interaction with fixed range\n\nIn the CF model described above, the interaction range of the particles depends on their\nmutual orientation (convergent, divergent or tandem). We first derive the distance distribution for a slightly simpler system, in which the interaction range does not depend on the\norientation.\nWe consider a one-dimensional space (representing the chromosome) of length L0 containing N \u2212 1 particles (representing ORFs). We choose to describe the system in the\nmicro-canonical ensemble, with fixed total energy E. The state of the system can be described by a vector ~n = (n1 , n2 , . . . , nN ),\nPwhere ni is the length of the ith inter-particle\nspace. The sum of these numbers, L \u2261 i ni , is the total free space in the system. The\nvalue of L is fixed and L \u001d 1. As the particles occupy part of the total space, L < L0 .\n\n8\n\n\fFor now we assume that the particles interact with a finite-ranged CF potential U (n),\ndefined as:\n\u001a\nU (n)\n\u000f(r \u2212 n) (n < r)\n=\n(1)\n0\n(n \u2265 r),\nkT\nwhere r is the range of the interaction, and \u000f is the energy associated with an overlap of\none base pair (in units of kT ); it is related to q as \u000f = \u2212 ln(q).\nIn order to compute the probability distribution of intergenic distances, we divide the\nsystem into two subsystems. Subsystem 1 (S1) is a particular, but arbitrary, inter-particle\nspace x, while subsystem 2 (S2) is the rest of the system. We will compute the probability\ndistribution P (nx ) of the length nx of space x. We define the multiplicity function of\nsubsystem S2, called \u03a92 (L2 , E2 ), as the number of states accessible for S2 given the available\nfree length for S2, L2 , and the available energy for S2, E2 . Note that L2 = L \u2212 nx and\nE2 = E \u2212 E1 = E \u2212 U (nx ). Then the probability that inter-particle space x has length nx\nis proportional to the number of states that are accessible to the rest of the system, S2,\ngiven that x has length nx :\nP (nx ) \u221d \u03a92 (L \u2212 nx , E \u2212 U (nx )) .\n\n(2)\n\nBy definition, the entropy \u03c32 (L2 , E2 ) of S2 is the logarithm of \u03a92 (L2 , E2 ). Therefore,\nP (nx ) \u221d e\u03c32 (L\u2212nx ,E\u2212U (nx )) .\n\n(3)\n\nAssuming that nx is small compared to L and that U (nx ) is small compared to E, we can\nnow expand the entropy as follows:\n\u03c32 (L \u2212 nx , E \u2212 U (nx )) =\n\n\u03c32 (L, E)\n(4)\n\u2202\u03c32 (L, E)\n\u2212 nx\n\u2202L\n\u2202\u03c32 (L, E)\n\u2212 U (nx )\n\u2202E\n+ ...\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u2202\u03c32\n2\nNote that by the standard Maxwell relations, \u2202\u03c3\n=\n1/kT\nand\n\u2202E L\n\u2202L E = p/kT , where\nT and p are the temperature and the pressure of the system. If N is large, the higher order\nterms are negligible.\nNow we can combine the expansion in equation 4 with equation 3 and obtain:\nP (nx ) \u221d e\u2212(nx p+U (nx ))/kT .\n\n(5)\n\nWe can calculate this in full using the definition of the potential in equation 1, arriving at:\n\u001a\nc e\u2212nx (\u03bb\u2212\u000f) (nx < r)\nP (nx ) =\n(6)\nc e\u2212nx \u03bb+\u000fr (nx \u2265 r).\n9\n\n\fp\nHere \u03bb is defined as \u03bb \u2261 kT\n. As we picked inter-particle space x arbitrarily, this probability\ndistribution holds for all inter-particle spaces. The number c is a normalization constant.\nGiven r and \u000f, the value of \u03bb is fixed if we impose the mean inter-particle distance:\nZ\nnx P (nx )dnx = L/N.\n(7)\n\nNote that, beyond the interaction range, the distribution is exponentially decreasing.\nWithin the interaction range, the distribution is also exponential, but the sign of the\nexponent depends on the size of \u000f: if the repulsion is strong (\u000f > \u03bb), the exponent becomes\npositive in the interaction range. We also note that if either the range r or the repulsion \u000f\nis set to zero, the distance distribution simply becomes a single exponential. The resulting\nmodel is known as a Tonks gas [17].\n\nA.3\n\nCF interactions with different ranges\n\nIn the previous subsection we discussed a CF model in which each particle interacts with\nits neighbors according to one fixed interaction range. In the relevant case, however,\nthe interaction range depends on the mutual orientation of the particles. The interaction\npotentials for convergent (C), tandem (T) and divergent (D) pairs can be written as follows:\n\u001a\nUC (n)\n\u000f(2\u03c4 \u2212 n) if n \u2264 2\u03c4 ,\n=\n0\nif n > 2\u03c4 ,\nkT\n\u001a\nUT (n)\n\u000f(\u03c4 + \u03c0 \u2212 n) if n \u2264 \u03c4 + \u03c0,\n(8)\n=\n0\nif n > \u03c4 + \u03c0,\nkT\n\u001a\nUD (n)\n\u000f(2\u03c0 \u2212 n) if n \u2264 2\u03c0,\n=\n0\nif n > 2\u03c0.\nkT\nIt is rather straightforward to adjust the calculations in the previous section to this case.\nWe again divide the system in two parts, S1 and S2, in which S1 consists of one\ninter-particle region called x, and S2 is the rest of the system. The derivation in the\nprevious section applies without alteration up to equation 5, irrespective of the orientation\ncorresponding to x (that is: D, T or C). Only in the step from equation 5 to equation 6, the\ndifference in the potentials for D, T and C becomes relevant. As a result, the distributions\nfor the D, C and T intergenic regions all have the form of equation 6, except for a different\nrange r, and a different normalization factor c:\n\u001a\nc1 e\u2212n(\u03bb\u2212\u000f) if 0 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u03c4 ,\nPC (n) =\nc1 e\u2212n\u03bb+2\u03c4 \u000f if n > 2\u03c4 ,\n\u001a\nc2 e\u2212n(\u03bb\u2212\u000f)\nif 0 \u2264 n \u2264 \u03c4 + \u03c0,\nPT (n) =\nc2 e\u2212n\u03bb+(\u03c4 +\u03c0)\u000f if n > \u03c4 + \u03c0,\n\u001a\nc3 e\u2212n(\u03bb\u2212\u000f) if 0 \u2264 n \u2264 2\u03c0,\nPD (n) =\n(9)\nc3 e\u2212n\u03bb+2\u03c0\u000f if n > 2\u03c0.\n10\n\n\fHere the prefactors c1 , c2 and c3 are defined as\nc1 =\nc2 =\nc3 =\n\n\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 \u000f)\n,\n\u03bb \u2212 e2\u03c4 (\u000f\u2212\u03bb) \u000f\n\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 \u000f)\n,\n\u03bb \u2212 e(\u03c4 +\u03c0)(\u000f\u2212\u03bb) \u000f\n\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 \u000f)\n.\n\u03bb \u2212 e2\u03c0(\u000f\u2212\u03bb) \u000f\n\n(10)\n\nWe note that the CF model has four parameters: \u03bb, \u03c4 , \u03c0, and \u000f. However, if we impose\nthe average length of the intergenic regions, this again leads to a constraint that eliminates\none of the parameters. As the total system is a mixture of D, C and T intergenic regions\nin proportions fD : fC : fT (in most genomes roughly 1:1:2), this constraint becomes:\nZ\nfD PD (n) + fC PC (n) + fT PT (n)\nn\ndn = L/N.\n(11)\nfD + fC + fT\nWe used Monte Carlo simulations to check the validity of these equations and found excellent agreement.\n\nB\n\nMore detailed models\n\nThe CF model is purposely oversimplified. Such simplified models, with few parameters,\nprovide insight into the essential ingredients of the mechanisms studied. At the same time\nthe simplicity of the CF model leads to certain artifacts. Here we show that such artifacts\ncan be alleviated by more detailed models. Below we discuss how one can allow for varying\nUCR and DCR lengths, and how alternative interaction potentials can be chosen, with\ndistance-dependent forces.\n\nB.1\n\nPolydisperse UCRs and DCRs\n\nThe distributions of the CF model have a sharp peak; this is an artifact of our assumption\nthat all UCRs and all DCRs have the same length. We can extend the model to describe\nsystems with varying UCR and DCR lengths.\nIf UCR and DCR lengths vary, then this results in a varying interaction range r. In\ngeneral, due to differences in the UCR and DCR lengths, the interaction range obeys\nprobability distributions pC (r), pD (r) and pT (r) for the convergent, divergent and tandem\nintergenic regions respectively. Then at a given pressure \u03bb the distributions of intergenic\ndistances are given by\nZ \u221e\nPC (n) =\npC (r)P (n|\u03bb, r)dr,\n(12)\n0\n\n11\n\n\fZ\n\n\u221e\n\nPD (n) =\n\npD (r)P (n|\u03bb, r)dr,\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\npT (r)P (n|\u03bb, r)dr.\n\nPT (n) =\n0\n\nHere P (n|\u03bb, r) is the probability distribution for the length n of an intergenic region, given\nthe interaction range r and the pressure \u03bb; it depends on the the form of the interaction\npotential. For instance, if the potential is that of the CF model (equation 1), then P (n|\u03bb, r)\nis given by equation 6. Note that we retrieve the original CF model if we insert pC (r) =\n\u03b4(r \u2212 2\u03c4 ), pD (r) = \u03b4(r \u2212 2\u03c0) and pT (r) = \u03b4(r \u2212 (\u03c4 + \u03c0)) in the above integrals.\nIn the case of S. cerevisiae some studies [6, 4, 5, 18] suggest that the distribution of\n3'-UTRs is log-normal. We therefore assume that pC (r) is the distribution of the sum of\ntwo numbers drawn independently from a log-normal distribution. A sum of log-normally\ndistributed random variables can be approximated reasonably by another log-normal distribution. We therefore assume that pC (r) is log-normal as well (with parameters \u03bc and\n\u03c3). The corresponding fit to the histogram of convergent intergenic distances in S. cerevisiae is better than the fit of the CF model and does not show the artifactual sharp peak\n(see Fig. 3). Nevertheless, the mean of the best-fitting log-normal distribution (\u03bc = 4.61,\n2\n\u03c3 = 0.405, mean = e\u03bc+\u03c3 /2 = 109) is rather close to the estimate resulting from the CF\nmodel. (2\u03c4 = 122). Below we show that a better agreement with experiment can be\nobtained if we allow for an alternative interaction potential.\nModel with lognormal DCR length distribution\n\nModel with parabolic potential\n\n0.0035\n\n0.0035\n\nprobability\n\n0.003\n\n0.003\n\nData\nFit\n\n0.0025\n\nData\nFit\n\n0.0025\n\n0.002\n\n0.002\n\n0.0015\n\n0.0015\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0005\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\ndistance (bp)\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\ndistance (bp)\n\nFigure 3: Fits of two more detailed models to the length distribution of convergent intergenic regions in S. cerevisiae. The fact that both models allow for nearly perfect fits\nshows that one needs additional, independent information to distinguish between the various compatible models. Left: CF model with log-normally distributed DCR lengths. Fit\nparameters for the log-normal distribution: \u03bc = 4.61, \u03c3 = 0.405, \u03bb = 5.25, \u000f = 4.70 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nRight: Log-normally distributed DCR lengths and parabolic potential. Fit parameters:\n\u03bc = 5.01, \u03c3 = 0.314, \u03bb = 4.95 \u00d7 10\u22123 , U0 = 4.11.\n\n12\n\n\fB.2\n\nAlternative potentials\n\nIn the CF model, we used the simple potential defined in equation 1. This potential was\nconvenient because of its simplicity (only one parameter) and its straightforward interpretation. It is, however, possible to generalize our approach to alternative potentials.\nEquation 5 holds for any finite-ranged potential U (n); this means that equations 5 and 12\ncan be used to compute the ORF spacing for arbitrary finite-range potentials.\n\nB.3\n\nYeast DCRs\n\nIn the main text, we mentioned that the CF model predictions for the DCR length are\non the low side. Not much is known about termination sequences in S. cerevisiae, but\nmost of the poly-adenylation signals seem to occur within 70 bp from the stop codon\n[4]. Estimates for the median 3' UTR length in S. cerevisiae range from 80 to about 100\nbp[6, 5]. This shows that, although the CF model does predict the qualitative features of\nthe distributions in Yeast, such as the exponential tail of the distribution, in order to get\naccurate quantitative agreement with the DCR lengths found in recent experiments, the\nassumptions of the CF model are too crude. Using the above techniques, we can refine the\nmodel and get better agreement.\nFirst, recent studies suggest that the 3'-UTRs in Yeast can be approximated by a lognormal distribution; we therefore now choose pC (r) to be log-normal (with parameters \u03bc\nand \u03c3). Second, recent experiments strongly suggest that many 3'-UTRs are long and\nthat they often overlap considerably [6, 18]; nevertheless, the ORFs hardly ever get closer\ntogether than 120 bp. This suggests a model in which the force is not constant; instead,\nthe repulsion seems to be high at short distances, but low at longer distances. One way to\nmodel this is to use the following quadratic potential instead of equation 1:\n\u001a\nU (n)\nU0 (1 \u2212 nr )2 (n < r)\n=\n(13)\n0\n(n \u2265 r).\nkT\nThe fit of this model (with \u03bc, \u03c3, U0 and \u03bb as parameters, but a given mean distance) to\nthe convergent data is excellent (see Fig. 3); also, the resulting log-normal distribution for\n2\npC (r) has a mean e\u03bc+\u03c3 /2 = 160, which leads to a mean DCR length of about 80 bps. This\nis good agreement with the experimental results.\nIn the study of Van Helden et al [4], poly-adenylation signals were found at about 35\nbp and 55 bp downstream of the stop codon of ORFs. It is tempting to speculate that\nthese sequences are responsible for the strong repulsion starting at a distance of about 120\nbp in convergent intergenic regions.\n\nB.4\n\nHigher eukaryotes\n\nIn Fig. 4 and S5 the intergenic distance distributions for various different organisms are\nshown. Strikingly, the simple CF model can very well describe the qualitative features of all\n13\n\n\fthese model organisms, such as the exponential tail of the distributions and the dependence\nof the distributions on orientation.\nIn complex, multicellular eukaryotes, control regions typically are very long and exhibit\na high variance( see e.g. [19]). As the lengths and variances increase, the assumptions of\nthe constant force model become less justified. Above we have shown that the CF model\ncan be extended to incorporate alternative potentials and polydisperse interaction ranges.\nThis allows us to produce excellent fits to the data for all organisms. Nevertheless, when\nit comes to predicting the length distributions of UCRs and DCRs for higher organisms,\nthe results depend too sensitively on the choice of the potential to produce meaningful\npredictions. Therefore we refrain from using the fit parameters for D. melanogaster, A.\nthaliana, C. elegans and P. falciparum as predictions for the DCR and UCR lengths\n\nC\n\nSupplementary figures S1 and S2 and fitting procedure\n\nFig. 4 shows the distributions of intergenic distances for four different fungi and four additional eukaryotes, broken down into three different subsets (convergent, tandem, divergent).\nThe C and T distributions are also displayed in Fig. 5 in log-linear scale, combined with\nfits of the CF model. In case of the fungi, we used these fits to estimate UCR and DCR\nsizes in these species. The fit parameters are given in Table 1 in the main text.\nWe used the maximum likelihood method to fit our model to the data and to determine\nthe errors in the fit parameters. For a given set of observed intergenic distances ( {nC } and\n{nT } for convergent and tandem pairs, respectively), Bayes' rule states that the likelihood\nof a set of fit parameters obeys\nP (\u03c0, \u03c4, \u03bb, \u000f |{nC }, {nT }) =\n\n(14)\n\nP ( {nC }, {nT }| \u03c0, \u03c4, \u03bb, \u000f)\n\nP (\u03c0, \u03c4, \u03bb, \u000f)\n.\nP ({nC }, {nT })\n\nHere P (\u03c0, \u03c4, \u03bb, \u000f) is the prior probability distribution, which we take to be uniform.

To avoid possible influences of rare outliers,\nwe only used values of n that fall in the domain that is plotted Fig. 5.

We use the standard deviation of this Gaussian as the error in the maximum\nlikelihood parameter values.\nIn the main text, we discussed the values of \u03c4 and \u03c0, but not of q. The probability that\ntwo randomly chosen base pairs are the same and could therefore overlap is 14 . The fact\nthat q is much higher than 41 shows that \"overlap\" is much easier than expected based on\nthis argument. This could reflect the density of functional elements, but also the flexibility\nof functional sequences, and the fact that regulatory regions are not mono-disperse.\n\nD\n\nStatistical tests\n\nIn this section we describe the statistical tests that are mentioned in the main text.\n\n15\n\n\fS.cerevisiae\n\nC.glabrata\n\n0.004\n\n0.003\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.003\n\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.0025\n0.002\n\n0.002\n\n0.0015\n0.001\n\n0.001\n0.0005\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\nK.lactis\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nD.hansenii\n\n0.0035\n\n0.005\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.003\n0.0025\n\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.004\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.0015\n\n0.002\n\n0.001\n0.001\n\n0.0005\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\nC.elegans\n\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\nA.thaliana\n\n0.0012\n\n0.001\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.001\n0.0008\n\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.0008\n0.0006\n\n0.0006\n0.0004\n\n0.0004\n\n0.0002\n\n0.0002\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\nD.melanogaster\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\nP.falciparum\n\n0.0008\n\n0.0015\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.0006\n\nData Convergent\nData Tandem\nData Divergent\n\n0.0012\n0.0009\n\n0.0004\n0.0006\n0.0002\n\n0.0003\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\nFigure 4: Distributions of intergenic distances, broken down into three different subsets\n(convergent, tandem, divergent pairs), for four fungi and four additional eukaryotes.

The figure shows that pairs with a high\ncorrelations coefficient are more likely to be close together than the ones with low correlation coefficients. This fact supports the hypothesis that the pairs in the first peak have a\nshared, bidirectional cis-regulatory region.\n\nD.1\n\nCo-expressed divergent pairs in S. cerevisiae are closer together\nthan expected\n\nIn the main text, we state that co-expressed divergent gene pairs in S. cerevisiae have a\ntendency to have short intergenic regions. We tested this hypothesis as follows.\nWe used the expression data compiled by Dr. Andre Boorsma and Prof. Harmen\nJ. Bussemaker to compute, for each neighboring pair of genes, the Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient of their expression in about 900 experiments (see references [20, 21, 22, 23, 24,\n25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] for the original publications). These\ncoefficients were usually low (< 0.3). We then split the set of divergent pairs into two\nsubsets: those with a low correlation coefficient (< 0.3), called set 1, and those with a high\none (\u2265 0.3), called set 2. Next, we used a rank sum test to check whether the intergenic\nregions in set 2 are indeed shorter than expected at random.\nThe rank sum test was performed as follows. We first ranked the intergenic regions\naccording to their length. Then, we computed the sum of the ranks of the intergenic regions\nin set 2; we call it R. Next, we randomized the ranks in the data set 107 times, each time\ncomputing the rank sum of set 2 in the randomized data. Finally, we counted the number\nof times R was smaller or equal to the rank sums obtained from the randomized data. The\nresults show that the ORF pairs with a high correlation coefficient are significantly closer\ntogether than the ones with a low one (p < 0.002).\nWe checked that the observed signal is not due to paralogous gene pairs by excluding\nthem from the set and repeating the test; this did not change the result. As a control experiment, we tested whether the same signal is also present in the set of tandem neighbors.\n\n18\n\n\fThis is not the case (rank sum test: p = 0.56). We note, however, that a similar signal was\npresent in the set of convergent pairs (p < 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 ); we have no satisfactory explanation\nfor this fact.\nThe mean intergenic distance in set 1 is 721 bp; in set 2, it is 558 bp. The difference in\nthe distance distributions of both sets is visually apparent (see Fig. 6).\n\nD.2\n\nDivergent genes in S. cerevisiae are more likely to be associated\nwith the same process or component if they are close together\n\nWe studied whether there is an association between intergenic distance and functional\nsimilarity in divergent gene pairs in S. cerevisiae. In order to do this, we need to be able to\nquantify the functional similarity between two given genes. For this purpose we used the\nGO annotations of the GO Consortium (version 5.463 of Aug. 22 2007, see reference [12])\nand the information-theoretic measure for semantic similarity proposed by Resnik [13].\nThe Gene Ontology is a hierarchical vocabulary of terms that can be assigned to genes.\nIt falls apart into three independent taxonomies, each defined to describe one aspect of\ngenes: the biological process they are involved in, the molecular function they perform and\nthe cellular component they are active in.\nThe semantic similarity measure of Resnik provides, for each pair of GO terms a and b,\na similarity score s(a, b). If, for a given aspect \u03b1 (biological process, molecular function or\ncellular component), gene A has been assigned GO terms a1 . . . an , and gene B has been\nassigned term b1 . . . bm , then we define the similarity between genes A and B on this aspect\nas:\nS(A, B, \u03b1) = max s(ai , bj ).\n(19)\ni,j\n\nThus we can compute similarity values for each gene pair and for each aspect of the GO\nontology.\nIf a certain gene did not have any assignment for some aspect, then the similarity score\nwith any other gene was considered undefined on this aspect, and the gene was excluded\nfrom the analysis corresponding to this aspect.\nWe performed the following statistical tests. First, we divided the data set in two\nsubsets, set 1 and set 2. The first set consisted of all divergent pairs that were in the\n\"first\" peak and set 2 contained all divergent neighbors that were further apart. As the\nbordering value we chose d = 2\u03c0 = 375, since intergenic regions that are longer than that\nvalue can easily accommodate two independent promoters. We applied a Wilcoxon-MannWhitney rank-sum test to challenge the null hypothesis that the similarity scores of the\npairs in set 1 and set 2 are drawn from the same distribution. We repeated this test for\neach aspect of the GO. The test results are p = 8.8 \u00d7 10\u22124 , p = 0.06 and p = 4.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 for\nbiological process, molecular function and cellular component respectively. We also ran a\nSpearman rank correlation test on the data, which resulted in the values p = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 ,\np = 0.24 and p = 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n19\n\n\fWe conclude that the similarity scores belonging to the aspects biological process and\ncellular component are associated with intergenic distance. We do not, however, find a\nsignificant association between molecular function and intergenic distance. This is not very\nsurprising, as proteins with a similar molecular function (e.g. \"DNA binding\" proteins),\ncan act in very different processes and cellular components, so that there is no clear a priori\nreason to co-regulate them using a shared UCR.\nWe repeated this analysis for the convergent and tandem gene pairs. For the convergent\npairs, none of the statistics were significant. However, the tandem pairs showed a similar\npattern as the divergent ones; the Spearman rank correlation test resulted in p = 4.6 \u00d7\n10\u22125 , p = 0.41 and p = 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22125 for biological process, molecular function and cellular\ncomponent respectively.\nAt this point, it is illustrative to point at one interesting example in Yeast: the BIO3,\nBIO4 and BIO5 cluster [39]. All genes in this cluster are involved in the biotin biosynthesis\npathway. BIO3 and BIO4 are transcribed in a divergent orientation from a short intergenic\nregion of length 222 bp (which falls into the first peak in the length distribution of divergent\nintergenic regions) and are tightly co-expressed. The orthologs of BIO3 and BIO4 in E. coli\nare BioA and BioB; these genes are closely spaced divergent neighbors as well (87 bp), and\nare simultaneously repressed by BirA binding to their shared UCR. Phalip et al. already\nspeculate that a similar mechanism is at work in S. cerevisiae [39], but the mechanism of\nco-expression of these genes has not been studied in detail. BIO4 and BIO5 are tandem\nneighbors, and are only 55 bp apart, Clearly, this cluster has many of the features that we\nsee in our statistical analysis. We therefore suggest that detailed experimental work on the\nregulation of the BIO cluster might illuminate some important mechanisms that shape the\ndistribution of genes over the S. cerevisiae chromosome.\n\nD.3\n\nGreater than expected number of convergent intergenic regions with\nlength 20-60 bp in E. coli\n\nHere we show that the number of convergent intergenic regions with a length in the range\n20-60 bp, is significantly larger than expected in E. coli.\nIn the calculation below, we estimate the significance of the peak in a very conservative\nway. We take the best-fitting exponential probability distribution as our null distribution\n(the fit is shown in Fig. 1b in the main text; its scale factor equals 145 bp). This way,\nwe underestimate the statistical significance of the peak as we ignore the fact that the CF\nmodel actually predicts a dip in the distribution at the place of the peak.\nGiven the exponential null distribution, the fraction of the sample that is expected in\nthe domain 20-60 bp is 0.21. Since the total number of convergent pairs is 543, the number\nof pairs in this domain is a random variable X that is distributed binomially with p = 0.21\nand N = 543. The observed number of pairs in this domain in E. coli is 198; the probability\nfor this to happen given the null distribution is P (x \u2265 198; p = 0.21, n = 543) < 10\u221213 .\nBased on the numbers above we should have expected 0.21 \u00d7 543 = 114 pairs in the\n20\n\n\fdomain 20-60 bp. The actual observed number is 198; this means that we need about 86 bidirectional terminators to explain the data. If we assume that E. coli has 750 operons, we\nestimate that at least 2\u00d786\n750 \u00d7 100% = 23% of the operons is terminated by a bi-directional\nterminator.\n\nD.4\n\nIn E. coli, putative terminators in C regions are more often bidirectional than those in T regions\n\nHere we show that the fraction of putative terminators that is classified as bi-directional\nby RNAMotif software [2], is larger in C regions than in T regions.\nThe statistical test was performed as follows. Our null hypothesis is that the terminators in the C region are a random sample from the total set of terminators in C or T regions.\nIn total, the C and T regions together contain 1198 putative terminators, of which 222 are\nclassified as bi-directional by RNAMotif. The C regions contain 378 putative terminators,\nof which 104 are bi-directional according to RNAMotif. If the 378 are chosen at random\nfrom the total set of 1198 terminators, then the number of terminators in the sample that\nare classified as bi-directional is a hypergeometric random variable. The probability to observe at least 104 bi-directional terminators in a random sample of 378 terminators, taken\nfrom a set of 1198 terminators containing 222 bi-directional ones, equals 1 \u00d7 10\u22127 .\n\nD.5\n\nPutative bi-directional terminators in C regions tend to occur in\nshort regions\n\nThe fraction of the putative terminators in convergent intergenic regions that could be bidirectional (according to the RNAMotif algorithm) is significantly larger in short intergenic\nregions (< 100bp) than in long ones. We used the same statistical test as in the previous\nsubsection. In total, the C regions contain 378 putative terminators; of these, 104 are\nclassified as bi-directional. The short convergent intergenic regions contain 158 putative\nterminators, of which 62 are bi-directional according to RNAMotif. The probability to\nobserve at least 62 bi-directional terminators in a random sample of 158 terminators, taken\nfrom a set of 378 terminators containing 104 bi-directional ones, is 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\nD.6\n\nConvergent operons that are close together are not more often functionally related\n\nWe tested whether the convergent operons that are close together (< 70bp) are more likely\nto be active in the same biological process or cellular component than ones that are further\napart. For this we used the GO annotations from the GOA Database [40](version date:\nSeptember 9. 2007). The same method was used as in section D.2, except that we now had\nto perform the analysis on the level of operons rather than genes. In order to compute the\nsimilarity between two operons, we compared the GO assignments for each gene in the first\noperon with each gene in second; the maximum of these scores was used as a similarity\n21\n\n\fmeasure for the operons. We did not find a significant signal for any of the aspects of\nthe Gene Ontology ( molecular function: p = 0.20; biological process: p = 0.25; cellular\ncomponent: p = 0.27).\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
