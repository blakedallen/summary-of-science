Examples include abelian\nvarieties, their universal vector extensions (in characteristic 0 only) and\ncertain semi-abelian varieties. The main motivation to study quasiabelian varieties is the fact that the classification of group schemes\nover fields is essentially reduced to the classification of quasi-abelian\nvarieties and of affine group schemes. In fact one has (Theorem 2.1):\nTheorem 0.1. (Structure of algebraic groups) Every connected\nsmooth k-scheme in groups G decomposes as\nG \u2243 (G \u00d7 A)/H\n1\n\n\f2\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nwhere G is an affine connected group without finite quotients, A is a\nquasi-abelian variety and H is an affine commutative group k-scheme\nsatisfying:\n- H is contained in the center of G.\n- Aaff \u2282 H \u2282 A and H/Aaff is finite, with Aaff = affine part of A.\n- H is submerged in G \u00d7 A through the diagonal morphism.\nThis decomposition is unique up to isomorphisms of G and A.\nThis theorem is essentially contained in the work of Rosenlicht [Ro56]\nover an algebraically closed field. One can extend it to arbitrary fields\nusing the results of [BLR90]. We include a proof in order to be selfcontained.\nThis result reduces the classification of algebraic groups to the classification of affine groups and quasi-abelian varieties and motivates the\naim of this paper: the structure and classification of quasi-abelian varieties. A second motivation comes from the problem of classification\nof homogeneous varieties. This problem is essentially fulfilled in the\nproper case (see [Sa03]). The next step is to deal with the anti-affine\ncase (anti-affine means that the variety has only constant global functions). This case seems accessible because these varieties are rigid (as\nwe show in Theorem 1.7). It is convenient to study first the case of\ngroups. Firstly, because they are a particular case of homogenous variety. Secondly, because this study should be useful to understand the\nstructure of the automorphism group of these varieties (notice that in\nthe proper case this group is almost classifying).\nDespite its interest, the study of quasi-abelian varieties is limited in\nthe literature; they only appear implicitly in work of Rosenlicht and\nSerre (see [Ro58, Ro61, Se58a]). In Analytic Geometry there exists a\nnotion of quasi-abelian variety (see [AK01]) which is stronger than the\nalgebraic one. This means an algebraic variety over C such that, as an\nanalytic variety, has no non constant global functions. Clearly these\nvarieties are quasi-abelian in the algebraic sense, but the converse is\nnot true. For example, the universal vectorial extensions of abelian\nvarieties are quasi-abelian in the algebraic sense but they have non\nconstant analytical global functions because they are Stein.\nHere we obtain the structure of quasi abelian varieties and we reduce\ntheir classification to that of abelian varieties.\nWith respect to the structure of quasi-abelian varieties one first notices that Chevalley's theorem implies that a quasi-abelian variety is a\nprincipal bundle over an abelian variety A with affine, commutative and\nconnected structural group G. We shall prove that the classification of\nquasi-abelian varieties as groups is equivalent to their classification as\nprincipal bundles. That is, two quasi-abelian varieties are isomorphic\n(as group schemes) if and only if they are isomorphic as principal bundles over isomorphic abelian varieties with isomorphic structural groups\n(see Theorem 3.4 and Corollary 3.5). This will be a consequence of the\n\n\fPRINCIPAL BUNDLES AND QUASI-ABELIAN VARIETIES\n\n3\n\nrigidity of quasi-abelian varieties. In this direction, we shall give a\ngeneral rigidity theorem for anti-affine schemes, which, as mentioned\nabove, has its interest in the classification of anti-affine homogeneous\nvarieties.\nNext we deal with the classification of principal bundles over an antiaffine scheme Y with affine and commutative structural group G. We\nshall always assume that a principal bundle has a rational point (see\nRemark 3.1). Let us denote Prin(G, Y ) the set of isomorphism classes of\nprincipal G-bundles over Y and Prin(G, Y )ant the set of isomorphism\nclasses of anti-affine principal G-bundles over Y . If Y is an abelian\nvariety, let us denote Prin(G, Y )st\nant the set of isomorphism classes of\nanti-affine principal G-bundles over Y which are stable under translations on Y (see Definition 3.3). Theorem 3.4 says that the quotient of\nPrin(G, Y )st\nant by the automorphism group of G \u00d7 Y coincides with the\nset of isomorphism classes of quasi-abelian varieties with affine part\nisomorphic to G and abelian part isomorphic to Y .\nThe key point for our classification of principal bundles will be its\nrelation with the Cartier dual of G and the Picard scheme of Y , that we\nexplain now. Let \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y be a principal G-bundle. Each character \u03c7\nof G determines an invertible subsheaf L\u03c7 of \u03c0\u2217 OP , namely the subsheaf\nof functions of P over which G acts by that character; hence, the\nprincipal G-bundle \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y defines a morphism of functors of groups\nGD \u2192 Pic(Y ), where GD is the Cartier dual (functor) of G. We shall\nprove that this morphism classifies the bundle (see Theorem 4.10 for\nthe precise statement). Once Prin(G, Y ) is determined, we deal with\nPrin(G, Y )ant and Prin(G, Y )st\nant (see Theorems 4.14, 4.15 and 4.17).\nFrom here, making use of the knowledge of GD for either a unipotent\nor a multiplicative type G and the structure of Pic(Y ), we shall obtain a full description of Prin(G, Y ), Prin(G, Y )ant and Prin(G, Y )st\nant\n(see Theorems 4.18, 4.24, 4.25 and 4.27). In particular, we obtain\nthe known classification theorems of principal bundles over an abelian\nvariety whose structural group is either a vector space or the multiplicative group (see [MM74, Se59, Ro58]). This \"Cartier-perspective\" will\nbe also very useful for the classification of anti-affine homogenous varieties, since it is not difficult to prove that these varieties are principal\nbundles over proper homogeneous varieties.\nFrom this perspective we obtain our main result (Theorem 4.28) that\nclassifies quasi-abelian varieties over an arbitrary field k:\nTheorem 0.2. Let us denote ks the separable closure of k. Then to\ngive a quasi-abelian variety A over k with affine part G and abelian\npart Y is equivalent to give the following data:\n(1) A sublattice \u039b \u2282 Pic0 (Yks ), stable under the action of the Galois\ngroup G(ks /k).\n(2) A linear subspace V \u2282 H 1 (Y, OY ),\n\n\f4\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nsuch that \u039b \u2243 X(Gks ) and V \u2243 Addit(G), where Addit(G) is the\nvector space of additive functions of G and X(Gks ) is the group of\ncharacters of Gks . These data are given up to group automorphisms of\nY.\nThis classification was obtained in [Sa01], with similar techniques,\nwhen k is an algebraically closed field. It has also been proved independently by M. Brion (see [Br, Thm. 2.7]).\nAs a consequence of the classification theorem we obtain that every quasi-abelian variety over a field of positive characteristic is semiabelian. One also obtains that, over an arbitrary base field, the affine\npart of a quasi-abelian variety is smooth.\nAcknowledgements. We wish to thank M. Brion for his patient and\nenlightening attention to this paper. His valuable remarks have allowed\nthis paper to reach its final form.\nNotation and conventions. Throughout this article, k is a field with\nseparable closure ks and algebraic closure k\u0304.\nBy a scheme, we mean a scheme of finite type over k, unless otherwise\nspecified; a point of a scheme will always mean a valued point. Morphisms of schemes are understood to be k-morphisms, and products\nare taken over k. A variety is a separated and geometrically integral\nscheme. A functor is always a functor from the category of k-schemes\n(or k-algebras) to the category of sets. The functor of points of a\nscheme X is still denoted by X.\nAs in [Br] we say that a scheme X is anti-affine if OX (X) = k.\nWe shall use a boldface type to denote functors like Aut, Pic, Hom,\netc (functor of automorphisms, Picard functor, functor of homomorphisms, etc) and for the schemes representing them (when they exist).\nWe shall use a non boldface type like Aut, Pic, Hom, etc for the sets\nof automorphisms, Picard group, homomorphisms, etc.\nBy an algebraic group we mean a smooth group scheme G, possibly non-connected. An abelian variety is a connected and complete\nalgebraic group. For these, we refer to [Mu70], and to [Bo91] for affine\nalgebraic groups. For any group scheme G, a G-scheme means a scheme\nendowed with an action of G on it. A group G is of multiplicative type\nif Gk is diagonalizable. A torus is a smooth group of multiplicative\ntype.\nFor any group G, X(G) denotes the group of characters of G, i.e.,\nX(G) = Homgroups (G, Gm ).\nIt is well known that any commutative affine group G has a unique\nmultiplicative type subgroup K such that G/K = U is unipotent. We\nsay that K (resp. U) is the multiplicative type part of G (resp. the\nunipotent part of G). It is not true in general that G = U \u00d7 K, but it\nholds when k is perfect.\n\n\fPRINCIPAL BUNDLES AND QUASI-ABELIAN VARIETIES\n\n5\n\nFor any connected group scheme G we denote by Gaff the smallest\nnormal connected affine subgroup such that the quotient G/Gaff is an\nabelian variety. We shall call Gaff (resp. G/Gaff ) the affine part of G\n(resp. the abelian part of G). The existence of Gaff is due to Chevalley\nin the setting of algebraic groups over algebraically closed fields; in this\ncase Gaff is an algebraic group as well, see [Ro56, Ch60]. Chevalley's\ntheorem easily implies the existence of Gaff for any connected group\nscheme G, see [Ra70, Lem. IX.2.7] or [BLR90, Thm. 9.2.1]. If G is an\nalgebraic group and k is perfect, then Gaff is also an algebraic group. If\nk is not perfect, then Gaff is connected but it might be non smooth. We\ndo not know if Gaff can be non-reduced. In any case, it is immediate\nthat Gaff is quasi-reduced. By this we mean\nDefinition 0.3. We say that a group scheme G is quasi-reduced if\nfor any subgroup H \u2282 G such that Hred = Gred one has H = G. If\nG is connected, this is equivalent to say that G does not admit finite\nquotients.\nRemark 0.4. Let G be a group of multiplicative type. Then, for\n*n\nany n \u2208 N, the multiplication G \u2192 G is an isogeny. Moreover, if\nn = |Gk /(Gk )red |, then nG is smooth and connected. Hence nG coincides with the reduced and connected component at the origin of G. In\nconclusion, if G is a connected and quasi-reduced group of multiplicative type, then it is a torus.\n1. Quasi-abelian part of a group scheme. Basic properties\nof quasi-abelian varieties: Rigidity\nIn this section we establish known results about quasi-abelian varieties and we generalize the rigidity theorem of proper varieties to\nanti-affine schemes.\nThe following results, stated without proof, can be found in [DG70,\nSec. III.3.8].\nTheorem 1.1. If G is a quasi-abelian variety then it is smooth and\nconnected.\nIf G is a group scheme, then A = H 0 (G, OG ) is a Hopf k-algebra and\none has a natural morphism of groups:\n\u03c0aff : G \u2192 Aff(G)\nwhere Aff(G) = Spec A.\nThis affine group Aff(G) is called the affinization group of G and it\nsatisfies trivially the universal property:\nHomgroups (G, H) = Homgroups (Aff(G), H)\nfor any affine group H.\n\n\f6\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nDefinition 1.2. For each group scheme G we denote Gqa = ker \u03c0aff\nand we call it the quasi-abelian part of G. One has G/Gqa = Aff(G).\nProposition 1.3. The quasi-abelian part of G is a quasi-abelian variety.\nTheorem 1.4. Let G be a quasi-abelian variety and H a connected\ngroup. If f : G \u2192 H is a morphism of schemes such that f (e) = e,\nthen\n(1) f is a morphism of groups,\n(2) f takes values in the center of H,\n(3) f takes values in Hqa .\nTheorem 1.5. If G is a quasi-abelian variety then its group structure is\nunique (once the neutral point is fixed) and it is commutative. Moreover\nif G is a subgroup of a group H, then it is contained in the center of\nH.\nThe latter two theorems can be easily obtained from the rigidity\ntheorem for anti-affine schemes that we shall next prove. It generalizes\nthe rigidity theorem of abelian varieties and it shows that rigidity is\nnot as much a consequence of properness but of anti-affinity.\nLemma 1.6. Let X be an anti-affine scheme and Y an affine scheme.\nAny morphism of schemes X \u2192 Y is constant (i.e., it factors through\na morphism Spec k \u2192 Y ).\nProof. Obvious.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 1.7. (Rigidity of anti-affine schemes) Let X, Y and Z\nbe schemes, X anti-affine with some rational point, Y connected and\nZ separated. Let\nf : X \u00d7 Y \u2212\u2192 Z\nbe a morphism. If there exist a closed point y0 \u2208 Y such that f|X\u00d7{y0 }\nis a constant morphism, then f factors\nX \u00d7Y\np2\n\nf\n\n/Z\n;\nww\nw\nw\nw\nww g\n\u000f www\n\nY\n\nwhere p2 is the second projection.\nProof. We shall fix a rational point x0 \u2208 X. Let us define g : Y \u2192 Z\nas g(y) = f (x0 , y). We claim that f = g \u25e6 p2 .\n(a) Assume that Z is an affine scheme, Z = Spec A. Then f is\nconstant on X, because to give a morphism X \u00d7 Y \u2192 Z is equivalent\nto give a morphism of k-algebras A \u2192 H 0 (X \u00d7Y, OX\u00d7Y ) = H 0 (Y, OY ),\ni.e., a morphism Y \u2192 Z.\n\n\fPRINCIPAL BUNDLES AND QUASI-ABELIAN VARIETIES\n\n7\n\n(b) If the morphism f0 : (X \u00d7 Y )top \u2192 Ztop , between the underlying\ntopological spaces, factors through g0 : Ytop \u2192 Ztop (i.e. f0 = g0 \u25e6(p2 )0 ),\nthen f factors. Indeed, for each affine open subscheme U \u2282 Z, let\nV = g0\u22121 (U). One has f0\u22121 (U) = X \u00d7 V . Then f maps X \u00d7 V into U\nand the morphism\nf : X \u00d7 V \u2192 U factors through g : V \u2192\n(a)).\nS\nSU (by\n\u22121\nSo if Z = i Ui is an affine open covering, then X \u00d7 Y = i f (Ui ) is\nan open covering and f factors over each f \u22121 (Ui ).\n(c) We can assume that Y is irreducible. Indeed, let Y = Y0 \u222a* * *\u222aYn\nbe a decomposition on irreducible components such that y0 \u2208 Y0 . Let\nYi be another component meeting Y0 . If the claim holds when Y is an\nirreducible scheme, then f is constant along fibers over Y0 . So, f is\nconstant along fibers over Y0 \u2229 Yi , and then along fibers over Y0 \u222a Yi .\nBy recurrence, f is constant along fibers over the whole Y .\nNow let T \u2282 X \u00d7 Y be the sub-scheme of points t such that f (t) =\n(g \u25e6 p2 )(t). Since Z is separated, T is a closed sub-scheme.\n(d) T contains a open neighborhood of X \u00d7 {y0 }. Indeed, let O\nbe the local ring of Y at y0 , m its maximal ideal and let us denote\nXn = X \u00d7 Spec O/mn \u2282 X \u00d7 Y . It is clear that f (Xn ) is a finite\nsubscheme of Z (supported on z0 ). Then f (Xn ) is an affine scheme\nand, by (a), f |X factors through Spec O/mn , i.e. it is equal to g \u25e6 p2 .\nn\nT\nHence T \u2283 Xn for all n. Since n mn = 0, we conclude that T contains\na neighborhood of X \u00d7 {y0 } in X \u00d7 Y .\nNow, since Y is irreducible, each irreducible component of X \u00d7 Y\nmaps surjectively on Y . So, all of them cut X \u00d7{y0 }. By (d) T contains\na non empty open subset of each one. Since T is closed, it contains\nall irreducible components of X \u00d7 Y . So Ttop = (X \u00d7 Y )top and we\nconclude by (b).\n\u0003\n2. Structure of algebraic groups\nWe give a structure theorem for algebraic groups that sums up results\nof Chevalley, Rosenlicht, Demazure-Gabriel and [BLR90].\nTheorem 2.1. (Structure of algebraic groups) Every connected\nalgebraic group G decomposes as\nG \u2243 (G \u00d7 A)/H\nwhere G is an affine connected quasi-reduced group (see definiton 0.3),\nA is a quasi-abelian variety and H is an affine commutative group\nscheme satisfying:\n- H \u2282 Z(G).\n- Aaff \u2282 H \u2282 A and H/Aaff is finite.\n- H is submerged in G \u00d7 A through the diagonal morphism.\nThis decomposition is unique up to isomorphisms of G and A.\nProof. If we denote G = Gaff , A = Gqa , H = Gaff \u2229 Gqa , then one has\nthe desired decomposition. Indeed: the quotient of G by Gaff * Gqa\n\n\f8\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nis trivial because it is a quotient of the abelian variety G/Gaff and a\ngroup quotient of the affine group G/Gqa and so it is an abelian variety\nand an affine group. Hence G = Gaff * Gqa . Moreover A/H \u0592\u2192 G/Gaff\nis abelian and so Aaff \u2282 H and H/Aaff \u2282 A/Aaff is closed and affine\n(because H \u2282 Gaff is affine) and then it is finite.\nConversely, if G \u2243 (G \u00d7 A)/H as in the theorem hypothesis, then G\nand A are normal connected subgroups of G, H = G \u2229 A, G is affine\nquasi-reduced and A is a quasi-abelian variety. Moreover G/G \u2243 A/H\nis an abelian variety (because A/H is a quotient of A/Aaff , an abelian\nvariety) and G/A is affine because it is a quotient of G. Hence G =\nGaff , A = Gqa and then H = Gaff \u2229 Gqa .\n\u0003\nThis theorem says that the classification of algebraic groups is essentially reduced to the classification of affine groups and quasi-abelian\nvarieties.\nWe can refine this result when the base field is perfect in the following\nway (see also [Br], sections 3.2 and 3.3, for related results):\nProposition 2.2. Let G be a connected algebraic group over a perfect\ne a\nfield k. Then there exists a reduced, connected and affine group G,\nquasi-abelian variety A and an isogeny\ne \u00d7 A)/U \u2192 G\n\u03c6 : (G\nsuch that \u03c6 |Ge and \u03c6 |A are injective morphisms, where U is the unipoe \u00d7 A is the diagonal morphism induced\ntent part of Aaff and U \u2192 G\ne\ne and\nby an immersion U \u0592\u2192 Z(G). Moreover, with these conditions, G\ne is a quasiA are unique up to isomorphisms. In fact A \u2243 Gqa and G\ncomplement of the multiplicative part of Aaff in Gaff .\n\nProof. Let us take A = Gqa and let us denote by S the multiplicative\npart of Aaff . By Theorem 2.1 it suffices to show that S has a quasicomplement in Gaff . This is well known if Gaff is reductive. For the\ngeneral case, let G\u2032 be a quasi-complement of S in Gaff /Ru , where Ru\nis the unipotent radical of Gaff . If \u03c0 : Gaff \u2192 Gaff /Ru is the quotient\ne = \u03c0 \u22121 (G\u2032 ) is a quasi-complement of S in Gaff .\nmap, then G\ne and A is not difficult.\nThe uniqueness of G\n\u0003\n3. Quasi-abelian varieties as principal bundles\n\nAs we have seen, a quasi-abelian variety A is a commutative group\n(Theorem 1.5). Moreover there exists a connected and affine subgroup\nG \u2282 A such that the quotient A/G exists and it is an abelian variety\n(Chevalley's structure theorem). Therefore a quasi-abelian variety may\nbe thought of as an extension of an abelian variety by an affine commutative group, or as a principal bundle on an abelian variety with affine\nand commutative structural group. Recall that a principal bundle over\na scheme Y with structural group G is a G-scheme P together with\n\n\fPRINCIPAL BUNDLES AND QUASI-ABELIAN VARIETIES\n\n9\n\na morphism of G-schemes P \u2192 Y (where G acts trivially on Y ) such\nthat the natural map\nG \u00d7 P \u2192 P \u00d7Y P\n(g, p) 7\u2192 (g * p, p)\nis an isomorphism. For short, we say that P \u2192 Y is a principal Gbundle.\nRemark 3.1 (Extra hypothesis). We shall always assume that a principal G-bundle P over Y has a rational point, since this is the case\nwhen P is a quasi-abelian variety. As we shall see, this implies (in\nour hypothesis, i.e., G a commutative affine group and Y an anti-affine\nscheme with some rational point) that a principal G-bundle over Y is\nlocally split: there exists a Zariski open covering Ui of Y such that\nP|Ui = Ui \u00d7 G. This is why we have used the terminology of principal\nbundles (which is more common in differential geometry) instead of\ntorsors.\nA morphism f : P \u2192 P \u2032 of principal G-bundles over Y is a morphism\nof G-schemes over Y .\nWe denote by Prin(G, Y ) the set of isomorphism classes of principal\nG-bundles over Y and by Prin(G, Y )ant the set of isomorphism classes\nof anti-affine principal G-bundles over Y . If Y is an abelian variety,\nwe shall denote by Prin(G, Y )st\nant the set of isomorphism classes of antiaffine principal G-bundles over Y which are stable under translations\non Y (see Definition 3.3).\nIt is clear that Autgroups (G) and Autschemes (Y ) act on Prin(G, Y ),\nPrin(G, Y )ant and Prin(G, Y )st\nant .\nWe say that two quasi-abelian varieties are isomorphic if they are\nisomorphic as group schemes. Two isomorphic quasi-abelian varieties\nhave isomorphic affine parts and isomorphic abelian parts. We shall\ndenote by Quasiabel(G, Y ) the set of isomorphism classes of quasiabelian varieties whose affine part is isomorphic to G and whose abelian\npart is isomorphic to Y . The aim of this section is to prove that\nPrin(G, Y )st\nant / Autgroups (G \u00d7 Y ) = Quasiabel(G, Y )\nThe key point is to show that if P is an anti-affine principal G-bundle\nover an abelian variety Y and it is stable under translations on Y ,\nthen P admits a (essentially unique) group structure such that P is a\nquasi-abelian variety with affine part G and abelian part Y . This will\nbe done in Theorem 3.4.\nLemma 3.2. Let G be a commutative group scheme and \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y\na principal G-bundle. Let us denote AutG\nY (P ) the functor of automorphisms of principal G-bundles of P . One has\nAutG\nY (P ) = Homschemes (Y, G)\nIn particular, if G is affine and Y is anti-affine, then AutG\nY (P ) = G.\n\n\f10\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nProof. Since G is commutative, it is clear that AutG\u2212schemes(G) = G\nand then AutG\u2212schemes(Z) = G for every G-scheme Z on which G acts\nfree and transitively. Then one has a morphism\nAutG\nY (P ) \u2192 Homk\u2212schemes (Y, G)\n\u03c4 7\u2192 f\u03c4\nwhere f\u03c4 (y) is the automorphism of G induced by \u03c4 in the fiber of\nthe (valued) point y. Conversely, given f : Y \u2192 G, one has a Gautomorphism \u03c4f : P \u2192 P , \u03c4f (p) = f (p) * p. We conclude immediately.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.3. Let Y be a group scheme and G an affine commutative\ngroup. A principal G-bundle \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y is said to be stable under\ntranslations on Y if for each point y : Z \u2192 Y there exists a faithfully flat\nbase change Z \u2032 \u2192 Z and a morphism of G-schemes \u03c6y : P \u00d7Z \u2032 \u2192 P \u00d7Z \u2032\nsuch that the diagram:\n\u03c6y\n\nP \u00d7 Z \u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 P \u00d7 Z \u2032\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c0y\n\u03c0y\n\u03c4y\n\nY \u00d7 Z \u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Y \u00d7 Z \u2032\nis commutative, where \u03c4y is the translation by y.\nMore briefly, a principal G-bundle P \u2192 Y is stable under translations on Y if any translation on Y extends (up to a faithfully flat base\nchange) to an automorphism of G-schemes of P .\nFor example, if A is a quasi-abelian variety with affine part G and\nabelian part Y , then A is a principal G-bundle over Y and it is obviously stable under translations on Y . We now see that the converse\nalso holds.\nTheorem 3.4. Let Y be an abelian variety, G an affine commutative\ngroup scheme and \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y a principal G-bundle. Then P \u2192 Y is\nstable under translations on Y if and only if P admits a group structure\nsuch that:\n(i) \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y is a morphism of groups,\n(ii) the kernel of \u03c0 is isomorphic to G as a G-scheme, and\n(iii) the translations by points of P commute with the action of G.\nMoreover, this group structure is unique (once the neutral point on\nthe fiber of 0 \u2208 Y is fixed), and it is commutative. If in addition P is\nanti-affine, then it is a quasi-abelian variety.\nProof. Assume that P has a group structure satisfying (i)-(iii). First\nnotice that P is commutative; indeed, let G0 , P0 be the connected\ncomponents through the origin of G, P , respectively. It is clear that\nG * P0 = P and then it is enough to prove that P0 is commutative. So,\nreplacing P, G by P0 , G0 , we can suppose that P is connected. On the\n\n\fPRINCIPAL BUNDLES AND QUASI-ABELIAN VARIETIES\n\n11\n\none hand the quotient of P by its quasi-abelian part is affine and then\nthe quotient by its center subgroup is also affine; on the other hand this\nquotient is a quotient of P/G = Y (because G is in the center of P )\nand then it is proper. Hence the quotient of P by its center is trivial\nand P is commutative. Now let us see that \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y is stable under\ntranslations on Y , i.e., each translation on Y lifts to an automorphism\nof G-schemes on P (after a faithfully flat base change). Indeed, since\nP \u2192 Y is a faithfully flat morphism, each point y of Y has some point\nin its fiber by \u03c0 (after a faithfully flat base change). So it is enough to\ndefine on P the translation morphism by any point of this fibre.\nAssume now that P is stable under translations on Y . Let AutY (P/Y )\nbe the functor AutY (P/Y )(Z) = {automorphisms \u03c6 : PZ \u2192 PZ of Gschemes which descend to a translation on YZ }. One has an exact\nsequence of functors of groups:\np\n\n0 \u2192 G \u2192 AutY (P/Y ) \u2192 Y \u2212\u2192 0\nwhere p is the morphism that maps each automorphism \u03c6 to the induced translation on Y . The surjectivity of p (for the faithfully flat\ntopology) is due to the hypothesis, i.e., \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y being stable under translations, and the kernel of p is G by Lemma 3.2. AutY (P/Y )\nacts freely on P . Moreover this action is transitive: indeed, given two\npoints p1 , p2 of P there exists a translation on Y transforming \u03c0(p1 ) on\n\u03c0(p2 ), so we can assume that \u03c0(p1 ) = \u03c0(p2 ). One concludes the transitivity because G acts transitively on the fibres of \u03c0. Now let us fix a\nrational point e \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (0). Transforming e by AutY (P/Y ) we obtain\nthat AutY (P/Y ) \u2243 P and so P has a group structure satisfying the\nrequired conditions.\nUniqueness: the translations on P define a group immersion P \u0592\u2192\nAutY (P/Y ), whose composition with the isomorphism AutY (P/Y ) \u2243\nP is the identity. So the group structure of P is the one induced by\nthe isomorphism AutY (P/Y ) \u2243 P .\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.5. Two quasi-abelian varieties are isomorphic (as groups)\nif and only if their affine parts and their abelian parts are respectively\nisomorphic and they are isomorphic as principal bundles. In other\nwords, one has a bijection\nPrin(G, Y )st\nant / Autgroups (G \u00d7 Y ) = Quasiabel(G, Y )\nRemark 3.6. As we have seen in the proof of Theorem 3.4, the existence and the uniqueness of the group structure of a principal G-bundle\nover a group Y only needs that Homschemes(Y, G) = G; that is, it only\nneeds that any morphism of schemes Y \u2192 G is constant. Hence Theorem 3.4 can be extended to different cases. For example, for the calculation of the extensions of unipotent groups (smooth and connected but\npossibly non commutative) by multiplicative type groups. In particular, this would reduce the classification of affine abelian groups (over\n\n\f12\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nan arbitrary field) to the classification of unipotent groups and of their\nprincipal bundles with multiplicative type structural group.\n4. Cartier Dual and classification of principal bundles\nIn this section we obtain the classification of principal G-bundles over\nan anti-affine scheme Y , with G an affine commutative group scheme.\nIt generalizes well known results about the subject in the particular\ncases when the structural group G is either a torus or a vector space\n(see [MM74, Se59, Ro58]). Moreover this result allows us to see that\nthe differences between these cases (torus and vector space) come only\nfrom the different structure of the respective Cartier dual groups (local\nand discrete, respectively)\n4.1. i-component of linear representations. Let G = Spec A be\nan affine group k-scheme. Let us denote\nI = set of finite sub-coalgebras of A.\nFor each i \u2208 I, Ai denotes the sub-coalgebra indexed by i.\nIt is well known that A = lim Ai . Then A\u2217 = lim A\u2217i is a profinite\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2190\u2212\n\nalgebra. If E is a G-module (i.e., a linear representation of G) then\nit is an A\u2217 -module. Moreover, if we denote Ei = HomA\u2217 \u2212mod (A\u2217i , E),\nthen Ei is an A\u2217i -module (acting on A\u2217i by the right) and E = lim Ei as\n\u2212\u2192\nA\u2217 -modules. Conversely, if E is an A\u2217 -module such that E = lim Ei ,\n\u2212\u2192\n\nthen E is a G-module.

One has a morphism of G-schemes\n\u03c0\u03c6 : P \u03c6 \u2192 Y (G acts trivially on Y ). Let us see that P \u03c6 \u2192 Y is a\nprincipal G-bundle. First of all, it is easy to see that the construction of P \u03c6 is stable under base change. That is, let f : Y \u2032 \u2192 Y be\na morphism of schemes (and assume that Y \u2032 has a rational point p\u20320\nin the fiber of p0 ) and let \u03c6\u2032 : GD \u2192 Pic(Y \u2032 ) be the morphism of\nfunctors obtained by the composition of \u03c6 with the natural morphism\n\u2032\nf \u2217 : Pic(Y ) \u2192 Pic(Y \u2032 ) induced by f . Let B\u03c6 the associated OY \u2032 -G\u2032\n\u2032\nalgebra and P \u03c6 = Spec B\u03c6 \u2192 Y \u2032 the associated G-scheme over Y \u2032 .\nThen one has a natural isomorphism of G-schemes over Y \u2032\n\u2032\n\nP \u03c6 = P \u03c6 \u00d7Y Y \u2032\nConsider now the particular case Y \u2032 = P \u03c6 . It is easy to see that in this\ncase \u03c6\u2032 (\u03c7i ) is the trivial invertible sheaf on Y \u2032 \u00d7Spec A\u2217i . It follows that\n\u2032\n\u2032\nB\u03c6 is the trivial OY \u2032 -G-algebra, i.e., P \u03c6 = Y \u2032 \u00d7 G. In other words\nP \u03c6 \u00d7Y P \u03c6 = P \u03c6 \u00d7 G\nso P \u03c6 \u2192 Y is a principal G-bundle.\nIt remains to prove that the assignations \u03c0 7\u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 and \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c0\u03c6 are\ninverse to each other.\nLet \u03c6 : GD \u2192 Pic(Y ) be a morphism of functors and \u03c0\u03c6 : P \u03c6 \u2192 Y\nthe associated principal G-bundle. Let us see that the morphism of\nfunctors associated to \u03c0\u03c6 coincides with \u03c6. By Remark 4.4 (1), it\n\n\fPRINCIPAL BUNDLES AND QUASI-ABELIAN VARIETIES\n\n17\n\nsuffices to see that both coincide on \u03c7i . That is, one has to prove that\n\u03c6(\u03c7i ) is the \u03c7i -component of B\u03c6 . Recall that B\u03c6 = lim B(i) , where\n\u2192\n\nB(i) = L\u03c7i \u2297A\u2217i Ai and L\u03c7i is the invertible sheaf representing \u03c6(\u03c7i ).\nAssume that one has proved that B(i) is the i-component of B\u03c6 . Then,\n(i)\nby Remark 4.7, B\u03c7\u03c6i = B\u03c7i = (L\u03c7i \u2297A\u2217i Ai )\u03c7i = L\u03c7i (see Example 4.6\nfor the last equality) and we are done. So let us prove that the icomponent of B\u03c6 coincides with B(i) . Indeed, locally on Y (for the\nZariski topology), one has L\u03c7j \u2243 OY \u2297 A\u2217j and then, if i \u2264 j, one\nk\n\nhas B(j) \u2243 OY \u2297 Aj and then (B(j) )i = B(i) . Taking direct limit one\nk\n\nconcludes.\nNow let \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y be a principal G-bundle and \u03c6\u03c0 : GD \u2192 Pic(Y )\nthe associated morphism of functors. We have to prove that B\u03c6\u03c0 is\ncanonically isomorphic to \u03c0\u2217 OP (as OY -G-algebras). Let us denote\nB = \u03c0\u2217 OP . By definition B\u03c6\u03c0 = lim (L\u03c7i \u2297A\u2217i Ai ), where L\u03c7i is the\n\u2192\n\ninvertible sheaf corresponding to \u03c6\u03c0 (\u03c7i ), i.e., L\u03c7i = B\u03c7i . Since one has\na canonical isomorphism of OY -G-modules Bi = B\u03c7i \u2297\u2217 Ai (see Lemma\nAi\n\n\u03c6\u03c0\n\n4.11 below) one concludes that B is canonically isomorphic to B as an\nOY -G-module. From the uniqueness of the construction of the algebra\nstructure of B\u03c6\u03c0 it is not difficult to see that this isomorphism is in fact\nan isomorphism of algebras. We are finished.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.11. Let \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y be a principal G-bundle and B = \u03c0\u2217 OP .\nOne has a canonical isomorphism of OY -G-modules\nBi = B\u03c7i \u2297\u2217 Ai\nAi\n\nProof. By lemma 4.8 one has B\u03c7i = HomA\u2217i (Ai , Bi ). Hence there is a\nnatural evaluation morphism:\nB\u03c7i \u2297\u2217 Ai = HomA\u2217i (Ai , Bi ) \u2297\u2217 Ai \u2192 Bi\nAi\n\nAi\n\nLet us see that it is an isomorphism. After localizing (for the flat\ntopology) we can assume that Y = Spec k and P = G and then B = A\nand Bi = Ai . In this situation one concludes because HomA\u2217i (Ai , Ai ) =\nHomA\u2217i (A\u2217i , A\u2217i ) = A\u2217i .\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.12. Under the same hypothesis, every principal G-bundle\nP \u2192 Y is locally split, i.e., there exists an open covering Ui of Y such\nthat P|Ui \u2243 G \u00d7 Ui .\nProof. There exists a \"big enough\" index j such that GD is generated by\nZj (as a group). Let Ui be an open covering of Y trivializing L\u03c7j , i.e.,\n\u03c7\nL|Uji\u00d7Zj \u2243 OUi \u00d7Zj . Then the composition GD \u2192 Pic(Y ) \u2192 Pic(Ui )\nis trivial. This yields that B|Ui is the trivial OUi -G-algebra; that is,\nP|Ui \u2243 Ui \u00d7 G.\n\u0003\n\n\f18\n\nCARLOS SANCHO DE SALAS AND FERNANDO SANCHO DE SALAS\n\nRemark 4.13. In the following theorems we shall make use of the\nfollowing elementary fact: Let \u03c7 be a C-valued character of G, i.e.,\n\u03c7 \u2208 GD (C). Let i be an index such that \u03c7 corresponds to a morphism\nf\u03c7 : Spec C \u2192 Zi . The induced morphism GD (Zi ) \u2192 GD (C) maps the\nuniversal i-character \u03c7i onto \u03c7. If \u03c6 : GD \u2192 Pic(Y ) is a morphism of\nfunctors and L\u03c4 denotes the invertible sheaf representing \u03c6(\u03c4 ) one has\n(1 \u00d7 f\u03c7 )\u2217 L\u03c7i = L\u03c7\nwhere 1 \u00d7 f\u03c7 : Y \u00d7 Spec C \u2192 Y \u00d7 Zi is the morphism induced by f\u03c7 .\nTheorem 4.14.

Moreover, if U\nis the unipotent part of G, then Addit(G) = Addit(U).\nTheorem 4.21. Assume char(k) > 0 and let \u03c0 : P \u2192 Y be an antiaffine principal G-bundle with dimk H 1 (Y, OY ) < \u221e. Then the unipotent part U of G is finite. In particular, if G is quasi-reduced (definition\n0.3) and connected, then G is a torus.\nProof. By Theorem 4.15, \u03c6\u03c0 : GD \u0592\u2192 Pic(Y ) is injective. Hence\nTe (GD ) \u2192 Te (Pic(Y )) = H 1 (Y, OY )\nis also injective.

General case. Let G be the affine part of a quasi-abelian variety\nA. By Theorem 4.21, if char(k) > 0, then G is a torus.

So one has:\nProposition 4.26. If A is a quasi-abelian variety, then its affine part\nAaff is smooth and it splits as a product U \u00d7 K, with U a unipotent\ngroup and K of multiplicative type.\nSo we assume henceforth that G splits as a product G = U \u00d7 K, with\nU a unipotent group and K of multiplicative type.
