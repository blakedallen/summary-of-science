Introduction\nThis paper seeks to take the methods used in [4] to show the uniqueness of locally\nsymmetric Brownian motion on the Sierpinski carpet and apply them to Brownian\nmotion on Laakso spaces, simplifying them where the geometry of Laakso spaces\nallow. These spaces were originally defined by Laakso in [13], given an alternate\nconstruction in [15, 16] based on [2], and the Laplacian analyzed in [15, 16].\nIn Section 2 the family of Laakso spaces is defined and the local symmetries\ndefined. Then Section in 3 the probabilistic arguments needed to prove the Elliptic\nHarnack Inequality (EHI) for harmonic functions on Laakso spaces are proven concluding with the proof of the EHI. From the EHI heat kernel estimates are proven\nin Section 4. Section 5 contains Theorem 5.2, the main result of this paper, that\nlocal symmetry invariant Dirichlet forms are equal up to scalar multiple. Finally\nin Section 6 the existence of a local symmetry invariant Dirichlet form is shown by\ntaking the Dirichlet form analyzed in [16] which is then shown to be invariant. The\noutline of this argument, and indeed many of the proofs are based on those in [4]\nin which the same result was shown for generalized Sierpinski carpets.\nAcknowledgments: The author thanks Alexander Teplyaev, Jun Kigami and\nNaotaka Kajino for their helpful suggestions.\n1.1. Generalities of Dirichlet Forms. Let (X, m, d) be a metric measure space.\nWe denote a regular Dirichlet form on L2 (X, m) by (E, F ). By this we mean that\nE is a bilinear, closed, symmetric form with the Markov property with domain\nF \u2282 L2 (X, m) such that C0 (X) \u2282 F densely and F \u2229 C0 (X) \u2282 C0 (X) densely in\nthe respective topologies.\nDate: November 1, 2018.\nResearch supported in part by the NSF grant DMS-0505622.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nBENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\nThe semi-group of operators Tt on L2 (X, m) associated to E is the semi-group\nwhose strong derivative at zero is the same self-adjoint operator as the generator\nof E. If A is the non-positive self-adjoint operator that is the derivative of Tt then\nwe have\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand\nTt (u) = etA (u),\n(1.1)\nE(u, v) = h \u2212Au, \u2212Av)i\nfor all u \u2208 F . There is a large literature on Dirichlet forms and specifically their\nconnection with self-adjoint operators resolvents, semi-groups of operators, and\nHunt processes. The standard reference used in this paper is [9].\nDefinition 1.1. Assume that m(X) < \u221e. Let (E, F ) be a regular Dirichlet form.\n(1) The form E is local if for any u, v \u2208 F with disjoint compact support\nE(u, v) = 0.\n(2) The form E is conservative if the associated semi-group satisfies Tt 1 = 1 a.e.\nfor all t > 0.\n(3) The form E is irreducible if the only set of positive measure which is invariant under Tt is X.\nThe following type of linear combination is going to be of reoccuring interest\nthroughout the paper. Specifically in Theorems 5.1 and 5.2 where it is shown that\na particular family of Dirichlet forms closed under this type of linear combination\nis one-dimensional.\nTheorem 1.1 ( [4]). Suppose that (A, F ) and (B, F ) are local, regular, conservative, irreducible Dirichlet forms on L2 (F, m) and that\n(1.2)\n\nA(u, u) \u2264 B(u, u)\n\nfor all u \u2208 F . For any \u03b4 > 0, set E = (1 + \u03b4)B \u2212 A. Then (E, F ) is a local, regular,\nconservative, irreducible Dirichlet form on L2 (F, m).\nComment on proof: All of the properties except the conservativity and irreducibility follow immediately from the definitions. That E is conservative follows\nfrom A and B being conservative and the compactness of L. The argument for\nirreducibility is found in the proof of Theorem 2.1 in [4].\n2. Laakso Spaces\nLaakso spaces were introduced in [13] in order to exhibit metric measure spaces of\nevery Hausdorff dimension greater than one that all support a Poincar\u00e9 inequality.\nBecause of the existence of an entire family of spaces it is possible to speak of those\nproperties which hold for all Laakso spaces and those properties which depend on\nthe member of the family that is under consideration. For example the metric\non the Cantor sets used in the construction will depend on the desired Hausdorff\ndimension while the essentially one dimensional behavior of the Laplacian that will\nbe defined in Section 6 does not. To be able to define Laakso spaces we first give\ndefinitions for several objects. We then prove a few properties of Laakso spaces.\n2.1. Construction of Laakso Spaces. Let K be a Cantor set with its elements\ndenoted by infinite sequences of 0's and 1's. For an integer j \u2265 2 and a sequence\nji \u2208 {j, j + 1} define\n\u001a \u001bdN \u22121\nN\nY\ni\nji\nLN =\n.\n(2.1)\ndN =\nd\nn i=1\nj=1\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF LOCALLY SYMMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION ON LAAKSO SPACES\n\n3\n\nShortly dN will be used in relation to the diameter of the cells to be defined below\nwhile LN will indicate where identifications will be made.\nDefinition 2.1. We set notation for three functions on Cantor sets.\n\u2022 Let Tn act on elements of a Cantor set by transposing the n'th digit in the\ninfinite sequence representation. The operator Tn can be extended to products of Cantor set K k by letting Tn operate on each copy of K separately.\n\u2022 Let \u03c3 : K \u2192 K be the shift function mapping so that for S \u2208 S1 \u03c3(S) = K.\n\u2022 Let \u03c8a : K \u2192 K be the contraction map sending K to the subset of elements\nstarting with the word a.\nDefinition 2.2. Set \u223cn to be an equivalence relation on I \u00d7 K k by identifying\npoints (x, w), (x, Tn w) \u2208 I \u00d7 K k for x \u2208 Ln \\ Ln\u22121 . Denote by \u223c the union of the\nequivalence relations, \u223cn . Then \u223c is again an equivalence relation because the sets\nLn \\ Ln\u22121 are disjoint over n. A Laakso space is defined as L = I \u00d7 K k / \u223c. Denote\nthe map I \u00d7 K k 7\u2192 I \u00d7 K k / \u223c= L by \u03b9, it is called the wormhole map.\nThe data determining a Laakso space are {ji } and k. In [6, 15] the spectral\nproperties of a Laplacian are given explicitly using only this data.\nProposition 2.1. Any Laakso space is metrizable with a geodesic metric. Relative\nto the geodesic metric the Hausdorff dimension of L is\n(2.2)\n\nlog(2lk dl )\nl\u2192\u221e log(d\u22121 )\nl\n\nQ = dimH (L) = lim\n\nwhenever this limit exists. If K is given a Bernoulli measure and and I the Lebesgue\nmeasure, then L inherits a measure from I \u00d7 K k . The inherited measure and the\nHausdorff measure relative to the geodesic metric are equivalent.\nProof. The first assertion is in [13]. The second claim follows from [11] by noting\nthat any single-valued branch of \u03b9\u22121 (L) is a lacunary self-similar set as a subset of\nR1+k with the pull-back metric and contraction factor ji\u22121 at each level. A lacunary\nself-similar set is one where the contraction ratios at each level have a geometric\nmean even if they are not periodic. The formula is an immediate consequence of\nTheorem 2 in [11]. If {U } is an open cover of a branch of \u03b9\u22121 (L) then {(1 + \u03b4)U } is\nan open cover of \u03b9\u22121 (L) for all \u03b4 > 0. So \u03b9\u22121 (L)has the same Hausdorff dimension as\nany of the branches. In this context \u03b9 is a 1\u2212bi-Lipschitz map from \u03b9\u22121 (L) \u2192 L. \u0003\nTo denote the distance between two points x, y \u2208 L we will use the notation\n|x \u2212 y| even though there is no additive group structure on L.\nMany of the proofs in this paper follow closely the arguments in [3, 4]. The\nuniqueness result on locally symmetric Brownian motions on Laakso spaces have\nbeen shown to hold for generalized Sierpinski carpets in [4]. Many of the proofs used\nthe specific geometry of generalized Sierpinski carpets to estimate the probability\nof processes hitting particular sets. These estimates were concerned with two types\nof trajectories: corner moves and slide moves. The corner move was the cause of\nmost of the technical difficulties. Laakso spaces can be thought of as having slide\nmoves, where a process moves from one piece of the boundary to another, adjacent\npiece of the boundary of a cell. In Section 3 these moves will be mentioned again\nin describing which arguments carry over from the previous literature.\n\n\f4\n\nBENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\n2.2. Symmetries of Laakso Spaces. We will define a folding map that will be\nused to describe the symmetries of the Dirichlet forms on Laakso spaces. Before\nwe define the folding map we first need a cell structure.\nN \u22121\nDefinition 2.3. Let LN = {xn }dn=1\nto be the wormhole locations for all depths\nless than or equal to N as in the Definition 2.2 listed in increasing order. Let\nKj , for j = 1, * * * , 2N k , be the depth N cells of K k . Then a depth N cell of L is\nS = \u03b9([xi , xi+1 ] \u00d7 Kj ). The set of all such N -cells is called SN .\n\nDefinition 2.4. For n \u2265 0 let S \u2208 Sn then \u03b9\u22121 (S) = [xi , xi+1 ] \u00d7 Ka . Then taking\n\u03c60 (x) = max{0, min{x, 1 \u2212 x}}extended periodically to all of R [4, Definition 2.12]\ndefine \u03c6S : [0, 1] \u2192 [xi , xi+1 ] by \u03c6S (z) = xi d\u22121\nn \u03c60 (dn (x\u2212xi )). Define KS : K \u2192 Ka\nby KS = \u03c8a \u25e6 \u03c3 n . Let \u03c6S be defined by\n(2.3)\n\n\u03c6S = \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c6S , KS ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121 .\n\nLemma 2.1.\n(1) For every n \u2265 0 and S, S \u2032 \u2208 Sn \u03c6S : S \u2032 \u2192 S is an isometry.\n(2) For every n \u2265 0 and S1 , S2 \u2208 Sn \u03c6S1 \u25e6 \u03c6S2 = \u03c6S1 .\n(3) For every n \u2265 0 and x, y \u2208 L. If there exists S1 \u2208 Sn such that \u03c6S1 (x) =\n\u03c6S1 (y), then \u03c6S (x) = \u03c6S (y) for every S \u2208 Sn .\n(4) For every n \u2265 0 let S \u2208 Sn and S \u2032 \u2208 Sn+1 . If x, y \u2208 L and \u03c6S (x) = \u03c6S (y)\nthen \u03c6S \u2032 (x) = \u03c6S \u2032 (y).\nProof.\n(1) Let S \u2208 Sn and \u03b9\u22121 (S) = [a, b] \u00d7 Ka where |a| = n. Then KS (Ka ) = Ka\nand if [a, b] is the n\u2212cell used to define \u03c60 ,\u03c60 ([a, b]) = id([a, b]) = [a, b].\nThen \u03b9 \u25e6 (id, id) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121 (S) = S, since \u03b9 \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121 = id. If S \u2032 6= S then \u03c6S (S \u2032 ) =\n\u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c60 , KS ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121 (S \u2032 ) = \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c60 , KS )([c, d] \u00d7 Kb ), where |b| = n, which\nequals \u03b9([a, b] \u00d7 Ka ) = S. Because (\u03c60 , KS ) is an isometry on I \u00d7 K k the\ncomposition is also an isometry.\n(2)\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03c6S1 \u25e6 \u03c6S1 = \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c6S1 , KS1 ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121 \u25e6 \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c6S2 , KS2 ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n(2.6)\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n\n= \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c6S1 , KS1 ) \u25e6 (\u03c6S2 , KS2 ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121\n\n= \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c6S1 \u25e6 \u03c6S2 , KS1 \u25e6 KS2 ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121\n\n= \u03b9 \u25e6 (\u03c6S1 , KS1 ) \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121\n= \u03c6S1\n\n(3) Let x, f \u2208 L, and S1 \u2208 Sn such that \u03c6S1 (x) = \u03c6S1 (y) and S2 \u2208 Sn . Then\n\u03c6S2 (\u03c6S1 (x)) = \u03c6S2 (\u03c6S1 (y)) implies by part b that \u03c6S2 (x) = \u03c6S2 (y) for all\nS2 \u2208 Sn .\n(4) Let S \u2208 Sn , S \u2032 \u2208 Sn+1 , and x, y \u2208 L such that \u03c6S (x) = \u03c6S (y). Then we\nare done if \u03c6S \u2032 \u25e6 \u03c6S = \u03c6S \u2032 . However both \u03c60 and KS have this property\nand the conjugation by \u03b9 does not disturb it.\n\u0003\nFor fixed S \u2208 Sn we define restriction and unfolding operators.

It is worth noting that mL is not genreally (mL ) . This is only true\nwhen ji is a constant sequence. Let (E, F ) be a local, regular Dirichlet form on\nL2 (L, \u03bc).

Let E be a local regular Dirichlet form on L, Tt the semigroup,\nand US RS f \u2208 F whenever S \u2208 Sn and f \u2208 F .

This is Proposition 2.21 in [4], the proof is the same as well in light of\nDefinition 2.5 above corresponding to Definition 2.15 in [4].

Theorem 1.1 gives that for any A, B \u2208 C with common domain and A \u2264 B\nthat E = (1 + \u03b4)B \u2212 A is a local, conservative, irreducible, regular Dirichlet form\nfor all \u03b4 > 0. To see that E is also invariant all that is necessary is to write out\nthe conditions in Definition 2.5 as applying to (1 + \u03b4)B \u2212 A and check that the\nconditions hold. Also E is non-zero as long as \u03b4 > 0.\n\u0003\nThis type of combination is only valid for Dirichlet forms with the same domain\nand the possibility of having different domains appear for elements of C has not yet\nbeen excluded.\n3. Processes on Laakso Spaces\nThe main goal of this paper is to establish heat kernel estimates for operators in\nC. Following the arguments of [4] we use a probabalistic approach to arrive at an\nelliptic Harnack inequality.\nLet (Xt ; t \u2265 0) be the diffusion associated with a Dirchlet form that is L-invariant\n(Definition 2.5) on L with laws Pz for z \u2208 L.\n3.1. The Reflected Process. We condense many of the results from [4] which\ndescribe the properties of the reflected processes, any skipped details can be found\nthere.\nDefinition 3.1. Let Xt be a diffiusion on L that is associated to a L\u2212invariant\nDirichlet form. Then for any choice S \u2208 Sn of cells along with its folding function,\n\u03c6S we define the reflected process in S by\nZtS = Zt = \u03c6S (Xt ).\n\n(3.1)\n\nWhere the superscript S in ZtS is omitted when no confusion can occur.\nTheorem 3.1. Let S \u2208 Sn . Then Z is a \u03bcS \u2212symmetric Markov process with\nDirichlet form (E S , F S ), and semi-group TtZ f = Rs Tt US f . Write P\u0303y for the laws\nof Z; these are defined for y \u2208 S \\ N2Z , where N2Z is a properly exceptional set for\nZ. There exists a properly exceptional set N2 for X such that for any Borel set\nA \u2208 L,\n(3.2)\n\nfor x \u2208 L \\ N2 .\n\nP\u0303\u03c6S (x) (Z \u2212 t \u2208 A) = Px (Xt \u2208 \u03c6\u22121\nS (A))\n\nProof. To ease notation we drop the subscript S from \u03c6S . Our first claim is the\nexistence of the properly exceptional N2 set for X such that\n\n(3.3)\n\nPx (Xt \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (A)) = Tt 1\u03c6\u22121 (A) (x) = Tt 1\u03c6\u22121 (A) (y) = Px (Xt \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (A))\n\nfor all Borel A, x, y \u2208 L \\ N2 such that \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(y). It is only necessary to\nprove this relation on a countable base (Am ) of the Borel \u03c3\u2212field. Note that\n1\u03c6\u22121 (Am ) = US 1Am so the claim reduces to showing that\n(3.4)\n\nTt US 1Am (x) = Tt US 1Am (y)\n\nfor x, y \u2208 L \\ N2 and \u03c6(x) = \u03c6(y). But US 1Am is invariant under \u0398 and by\nProposition 2.2 we have\n(3.5)\n\n\u0398Tt US f = Tt \u0398US f = Tt US f q.e.\n\nThus there is\nS a properly exceptional set N2,m such that (3.4) holds off of N2,m .\nTake N2 = m N2,m and N2Z = \u03c6(N2 ). Theorem 10.13 of [8] shows that Z is a\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF LOCALLY SYMMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION ON LAAKSO SPACES\n\n7\n\nMarkov process and that the semi-groups are related by TtZ f = RS Tt (US f ). Then\nthe last statement of the theorem to show is the symmetry of the process.\nThe proof of symmetry relies on two facts and a calculation. First is (3.4).\nThe second is that US RS Tt US f = Tt US f . The calculation is to write out both\n\u2212n\nhTt TS f, US gi and use\nhTtZ f, giS and hf, TtZ giS , using the definition of TtZ , as mL\nZ\nthe symmetry of Tt to show symmetry of Tt . Identifying the Dirichlet form follows\nby using TtZ to approximate E Z and comparing to the definition of E S .\n\u0003\nLemma 3.1. Let S, S \u2032 \u2208 Sn , and \u03a6 be an isometry from S to S \u2032 . Then for some\nproperly exceptional set N if x \u2208 S \\ N ,\n(3.6)\n\nPx (\u03a6(Z) \u2208 *) = P\u03a6(x) (Z \u2208 *).\n\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3.1, the definition of L\u2212invariance, and the\nequivalence of processes which have the same Dirichlet forms upto sets of capacity\nzero.\n\u0003\nDefinition 3.2. For Borel D \u2282 L let\n(3.7)\n\nED = {x \u2208 L : Px (\u03c4D = \u221e) = 0}.\n\nWhere \u03c4D is the exit time of D.\nDefinition 3.3. It will be useful to have a notion of \"half-face\" available. Let S\nbe a cell in L. Then it is of the form \u03b9(Ka \u00d7 [x1 , x2 ]) where a is a word of length n\nand x1 , x2 are adjacent in Ln \u222a {0, 1}. Then each subset of L of the following form\nis called a half-face:\n(3.8)\n\nAi,k = {q \u2208 L : \u03b9(xi , w) = q, w \u2208 Kak , k \u2208 {0, 1}k }.\n\nLemma 3.2. Let A0 , A1 be two half-faces of a cell S \u2208 Sn and S\u2217 the union of the\nelements of Sn that contain A0 . Set \u03c4 = \u03c4S\u2217 . There exists a constant q1 > 0 such\ndepending only on L such that if x \u2208 A0 \u2229 ES\u2217 and T0 \u2264 \u03c4 is a finite (FtZ ) stopping\ntime, then\n(3.9)\n\nPx (XT0 \u2208 S|FTZ0 ) \u2265 q1 .\n\nMoreover exists q0 > 0 such that\n(3.10)\n\nPx (TAX1 \u2264 \u03c4 ) \u2265 q0 q1 .\n\nProof. Because X is a diffusion and T0 \u2264 \u03c4 we have that XT0 \u2208 S\u2217 . From the\ngeometry of L, S\u2217 contains only 2k cells so q1 = 2\u2212k which is only dependent on L.\nLet z\u00b1 \u2208 Ln+1 be then adjacent elements to the xi in the definition of the halfface A0 . Then almost any path of Xt starting in ES\u2217 will hit either \u03b9(z\u2212 , K k ) or\n\u03b9(z+ , K k ) where K is the product of Cantor sets in the definition of L. It has\nalready been shown that with proability q1 this hit occurs in S \u2282 S\u2217 . In this case\nthere are 2k+1 neighboring half-faces of level n + 1, one of which comprises A1 . By\nthe symmetry of the process X the probability that the next one of these half-faces\n1\nhit is equal. Hence q0 \u2265 2k+1\n.\n\u0003\n3.2. Coupling. Coupling two locally invariant processes will provide a key step\nin proving the elliptic Harnack inequality. We state the following result used to\nproduce coupled processes in a manner that respects the local symmetry of the\nLaakso spaces.\n\n\f8\n\nBENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\nLemma 3.3 ( [4]). Let (\u03a9, F , P) be a probability space. Let X and Z be random\nvariables taking values in separable metric spaces E1 and E2 , respectively, each\nfurnished with the Borel \u03c3\u2212field. Then there exists F : E2 \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2192 E1 that is\njointly measurable such that if U is a random variable whose distribution is uniform\non [0, 1] which is independent of Z and X\u0303 = F (Z, U ), then (X, Z) and (X\u0303, Z) have\nthe same law.\nLemma 3.4. Let x1 , x2 \u2208 L where xi \u2208 Si \u2208 Sn , and let \u03a6 = \u03c6S1 |S2 . Then there\nexists a probability space (\u03a9, F , P) carrying processes Xi , i = 1, 2 and Z with the\nfollowing properties.\n(1) Each Xi is an E\u2212diffusion started at xi .\n(2) Z = \u03c6S2 (X2 ) = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6S1 (X1 ).\n(3) X1 and X2 are conditionally independent given Z.\nProof. Let Y1 , Y2 be diffusions corresponding to the Dirichlet form E that are equal\nin law and started at x1 , x2 respectively. Set Zi = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6Si (Yi ) for i = 1, 2. The\nDirichlet form for \u03c6Si (Y ) is E Si and the Zi have the same starting point they\nalso are equal in law. Then Lemma 3.3 can be used to find functions Fi such that\n(Fi (Zi , U, Zi ) are equal in law to (Yi , Zi ) for i = 1, 2, if U is an independent uniform\nrandom variable on [0, 1].\nOn a probability space supporting a process Z with the same law as the Zi and\ntwo independent random variables U1 , U2 independent of Z which are uniform on\n[0, 1] will be Xi = Fi (Z, Ui ), i = 1, 2 that will satisfy the three properties in the\nstatement of this lemma.\nSince the Xi is equal in law to Fi (Zi , Ui ), which are equal in law to Yi , i = 1, 2,\nthis establishes (1). Similarly (Xi , Z) are equal in law to (F (Zi , Ui ), Zi ), which are\nequal in law to (Yi , Zi ). Because Zi = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6Si (Yi ) it follows from the equality in\nlaw that Z = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6S1 (Y1 ) = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03c6S2 (Y2 ). This is (b).\nAs Xi = Fi (Z, Ui ) for i = 1, 2 and Z, U1 , and U2 are independent, (3) is immediate.\n\u0003\nGiven a pair of E\u2212diffusions X1 (t) and X2 (t) define the coupling time\nTC (X1 , X2 ) = inf{t \u2265 0 : X1 (t) = X2 (t)}.\n\n(3.11)\n\nThe coupling time of two diffusions is simply the first time they take a common\nvalue and then evolve together from that value.\nTheorem 3.2. Let r > 0, \u01eb > 0, and r\u2032 = r/(j + 1)2 . There exist constants q and\n\u03b4, depending only on L such that the following hold:\n(1) Supose x1 , x2 \u2208 L with |x1 \u2212 x2 | < r\u2032 and x1 \u223cm x2 for m \u2265 1. There exist\nE\u2212diffusions Xi (t), i = 1, 2, with Xi (0) = xi , such that with\n\u03c4i = inf{t \u2265 0 : Xi (t) 6\u2208 B(xi , r)},\n\n(3.12)\nWe have\n(3.13)\n\nP(TC (X1 , X2 ) < \u03c41 \u2227 \u03c42 ) > q.\n\n(2) If in addition |x1 \u2212 x2 | < \u03b4r and x1 \u223cm x2 for some m \u2265 1 then\n(3.14)\n\nP(TC (X1 , X2 ) < \u03c41 \u2227 \u03c42 ) > 1 \u2212 \u01eb.\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF LOCALLY SYMMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION ON LAAKSO SPACES\n\n9\n\nProof. This proof follows from Lemmas 3.2 and 3.4 as in Theorem 3.25 in [3] since\nthe cell structure of a Laakso space behaves similarly to the cell structure of a\ngeneralized Sierpinski carpet without the so called \"corner moves.\" In this theorem,\nthe constant q depends only k and j, that is only on the Laakso space and not on\nm.\n\u0003\n3.3. Elliptic Harnack Inequality. Let D be a relatively open subset of L and\nD\u2032 a relatively open subset of D. Let Xt be a Markov process and \u03c4D\u2032 be the\nstopping time of Xt leaving D\u2032 . If h(X\u03c4D\u2032 ) is a martingale under Px for quasi\nevery x \u2208 D\u2032 then h is probabilistically harmonic with respect to Xt . With this\nnotion of a harmonic function we can state the elliptic Harnack inequality which is\na statement about the behavior of harmonic functions.\nDefinition 3.4. The process X satisfies the elliptic Harnack inequality (EHI)\nif there exists a constant c1 such that the following holds: for any ball B(x, R),\nwhenever u is a non-negative harmonic function on B(x, R) then there is a quasicontinuous modification, \u0169, of u that satisfies\n(3.15)\n\nsup\nB(x,R/2)\n\n\u0169 \u2264 c1\n\ninf\n\nB(x,R/2)\n\n\u0169.\n\nWe need a few intermediate results before we can prove that the EHI is satisfied\nby these invariant processes.\nLemma 3.5. Let E \u2208 C, r \u2208 (0, 1), and h be bounded and harmonic in B =\nB(x0 , r). Then there exists \u03b8 > 0 such that\n\u0013\u03b8 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|x \u2212 y|\nsup |h| ,\nx, y \u2208 B(x0 , r/2), x \u223cm y.\n(3.16) |h(x) \u2212 h(y)| \u2264 C\nr\nB\nProof. This follows from Theorem 3.2 by the same argument as Theorem 4.2 in\n[3].\n\u0003\nProposition 3.1. Let E \u2208 C and h be bounded and harmonic in B(x0 , r). Then\nthere exists a set N of E\u2212capacity 0 such that\n\u0013\u03b8 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n|x \u2212 y|\nsup |h| ,\nx, y \u2208 B(x0 , r/2) \\ N\n(3.17)\n|h(x) \u2212 h(y)| \u2264 C\nr\nB\nProof. The proof of Proposition 4.20 in [4] carries over to this situation unchanged.\n\u0003\nLemma 3.6. Let E \u2208 C. Then there exist constants \u03ba, 0 < C1 depending only on\nL such that if 0 < r < 1, x \u2208 L, y \u2208 B(x, C1 r) then for all 0 < \u03b4 < C1 ,\n(3.18)\n\nPy (TB(x,\u03b4r) < \u03c4B(z,r) ) > \u03b4 \u03ba .\n\nProof. This follows from the cell structure by the same argument as Corollary 3.24\nin [3]. Again the only difference is that Laakso spaces only have slide moves and no\ncorner moves. The constant \u03ba measures the difference in \"depth\" of B(x, \u03b4r) and\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nB(z, r). That is if r is between d\u22121\nm and dm+1 while \u03b4r is between dm+4 and dm+5 ,\nthen \u03ba = 3. Also C1 < 1/2.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nBENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\nTheorem 3.3. The Markov processes associated to the Dirichlet forms in C satisfy\nthe elliptic Harnack inequality. That is for any z \u2208 L and h non-negative and\nharmonic on B(z, r) that a quasi-continuous modification h\u0303 satisfies\n(3.19)\n\nh\u0303(x) \u2264 ch\u0303(y),\n\nx, y \u2208 B(z, r/2) \\ N\n\nfor some constant c that depends only on L and E-capacity zero set N .\nProof. By looking at h + \u01eb and then letting \u01eb \u2193 0, we may assume that h is bounded\nbelow by a positive constant in B(z, r). Multiplying by a constant, we may assume\nthat inf B(z,r/2) h = 1. By Proposition 3.1 we have that h is bounded, positive, and\nquasi-continuous in B(z, r/2) so it is it's own quasi-continuous modification.\nBy Lemma 3.6 we have for x, y \u2208 B(z, C1 r) that\n(3.20)\n\nPy (TB(x,\u03b4r) < \u03c4B(z,r) ) > \u03b4 \u03ba .\n\nFor some \u03b4 \u2208 (0, C1 ). Which gives the estimate of the minimum of h on\n(3.21)\n\n1 = h(y) \u2265 Ey [h(X(TB(x,\u03b4r) )); TB(x,\u03b4r) < \u03c4B(z,r) ] \u2265 \u03b4 \u03ba inf\n\nB(x,\u03b4r)\n\nh\n\nso that\n(3.22)\n\ninf\n\nB(x,\u03b4r)\n\nh \u2264 \u03b4 \u2212\u03ba\n\nx \u2208 B(z, \u03b4r).\n\nWe then follow the argument in the proof of Theorem 4.3 in [4] to to control the\noscillation of harmonic functions using the H\u00f6lder continuity from above in terms\nof a power of \u03b4 that depends only on L.\n\u0003\n4. Heat Kernel Estimates\nWhile waiting for [10] to appear as a preprint the authors of [4] wrote a set\nof supplementary notes [5]. In the these notes conditions equivalent to two-sided\nGaussian estimates on a heat kernel are given. More detailed accounts are of course\nto be found in [10]. In [4] one set of equivalent conditions are used, but we shall\nuse the second. We define the conditions in the theorem before stating the theorem\nitself.\nDefinition 4.1. A metric measure space (X, d, \u03bc) has the volume doubling (VD)\nproperty if there exists a constant C1 such that\n(4.1)\n\n\u03bc(B(x, 2R)) \u2264 C1 \u03bc(B(x, R)\n\n\u2200x \u2208 X, 0 \u2264 R \u2264 1.\n\nWhere B(x, R) is the metric ball of radius R centered at x.\nWe will have need of a function with two useful properties time doubling and fast\ntime growth.

Given x0 \u2208 L and\nR < 2dist(x0 , \u2202L) then exists a maximal N \u2265 0 such that there exists an N \u2212cell\ncontaining x0 and entirely contained in B(x0 , R) called S1 . Then Xt starting at x0\na.s. leaves this cell through its boundary, so\n(4.8)\n\nEx0 [\u03c4B(x0 ,R) ] \u2265 Ex0 [\u03c4S1 ].\n\nHowever Ex0 [\u03c4S1 ] is equal to the exit time to \u03c0(Xt ) where \u03c0 is the projection of S1\nonto a line interval with length equal to the diameter of S1 . Similarly there is a\nminimal M such that a M -cell, S2 , containing B(x0 , R) where the analogous upper\nbound can be formulated. Note that diam(S2 ) \u2264 (j + 1)S1 so that the lengths of\nthese two cells is comparable.\nThis reduces the problem to exit time estimates on intervals of the real line.\nSince the Dirichlet forms in C are local, regular, conservative, and symmetric so\nare their projections onto the real line. If the results of [4] are applied the the\ngeneralized Sierpinski carpet that is [0, 1]2 the heat kernel bounds are Gaussian. By\nTheorem 4.1 exit time estimates on the square are controled by r2 . If the processes\nassociated with locally symmetric Dirichlet forms are projected onto [0, 1] we have\nthe same class of processes as are obtained from projecting the processes associated\nto elements of C to [0, 1]. Thus the exit times are controled by H(r) = r2 .\n\u0003\n\n\f12\n\nBENJAMIN STEINHURST\n\nDefinition 4.5.

Let X, d, \u03bc, (E, F )) be a metric measure Dirichlet space with d a\ngeodesic metric and (E, F ) conservative. Let H(r) be a time scaling function with\nconstants C1 ...C7 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 . Then the following statements are all equivalent.\n(1) The space X satisfies volume doubling, elliptic Harnack inequality, and\nRES(H).\n(2) The space X satisfies volume doubling, elliptic Harnack inequality, and exit\ntime estimates (E(H)).\n(3) The space X satisfies HK(H, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , c0 ).\nThis is Theorem 1.3 in [5] and a major result of [10]. In [4] the 1 \u21d2 3 is used\ninstead because the resistance estimates had been well studied in previous work by\nthese authors and others, [1,14]. The proofs of these implications are effective, that\nis from the information in Theorem 4.1.2 the constants \u03b21 , \u03b22 , and c0 as well as the\nfunction H could be given explicitly.\nTheorem 4.2. On any given Laakso space, the Laplacians associated to the Dirichlet forms in C all satisfy HK(H, 2, 2, c0), where c0 depends only on L.\nProof. We using Theorem 4.1 to reduce this proof to checking three conditions,\nvolume doubling, elliptic Harnack inequality and exit time estimates. Volume doubling is a consequence of the Q\u2212Ahlfors regularity of Laakso spaces as given in [13].\nThe elliptic Harnack inequality was shown in Theorem 3.3. The exit time estimates\nwere shown in Lemma 4.1.\n\u0003\nFollowing [12, Theorem 4.1] the domain of an arbitrary E \u2208 C is characterized\nas a Besov-Lipschitz space.

Uniqueness of Brownian Motion\nFollowing on Theorem 4.3 where it was shown that the elements of C have a\ncommon domain the following definition of the Hilbert projective metric is welldefined. Then Theorem 5.1 shows that in the projective metric C is a bounded set.\nFinally Theorem 5.2 shows that C must them be a one dimensional vector space.\nDefinition 5.1.

Minimal Generalized Upper Gradient Laplacian\nIn [13] the existence of minimal generalized upper gradients is used to show that\nthere is a weak (1, 1)\u2212Poincar\u00e9 inequality on Laakso spaces. Cheeger, in [7] had\nalready shown how minimal generalized upper gradients can be used in a version\nof Sobolev theory as replacements for derivatives. Here we use them to exhibit an\nL\u2212invariant Dirichlet form constructed in [16] and shown to be L\u2212invariant in this\npaper.\nThis Laplacian and its spectrum were analyzed in [6, 15]. In those papers the\nspectrum was computed along with the dimension of each eigenspace. The Hausdorff, walk, and spectral dimensions were computed for every Laakso space with\nk = 1 in [6].\nDefinition 6.1. In a metric measure space, (X, d, \u03bc), a generalized upper gradient\nof a continuous function f \u2208 C(X) is a function pf taking values in [0, \u221e] with the\nfollowing property:\nZ\npf dm\n(6.1)\n|f (x) \u2212 f (y)| \u2264\n\u03b3\n\nWhere x, y \u2208 X and \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 X is any rectifiable path from x to y, and dm\nis the measure induced on the image of \u03b3 by the arc length parameterization of \u03b3.\nSuch a function pf exists for any f \u2208 C(X) because pf = \u221e is a generalized upper\ngradient for every continuous function.\nA minimal generalized upper gradient (MGUG) is a generalized upper gradient\nthat is \u03bc\u2212almost everywhere less than or equal to all other generalized upper gradients.\nMany of the basic properties of minimal generalized upper gradients, including\nthe fact that the space of square integrable functions with square integrable minimal\ngeneralized upper gradients and is a closable space is shown in [7]. The following\nproposition is one of the main resultes of [16].\nProposition 6.1. There exists a local, regular Dirichlet form, (EM , FM ), such that\nfor f \u2208 FM\nZ\n(6.2)\nEM (f, f ) =\np2f d\u03bc.\nL\n\nThis Dirichlet form will be refered to as the MGUG Dirichlet form when it needs\nto be distinguished.\nLemma 6.1. The Dirichlet form (EM , FM ) is in C (see Definition 2.5).\nProof. We first describing a dense subset of FM on which invariance can be checked\nand then we claim by density that EM is L\u2212invariant on its entire domain. Denote\nby Dn those functions on L that are continuous, for given w \u2208 Lk are piecewise\n\n\fUNIQUENESS OF LOCALLY SYMMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION ON LAAKSO SPACES 15\n\ndifferentiable on the line segment \u03b9(I \u00d7 w), and for given x \u2208 I is constant on each\nn\u2032 th level cell of \u03b9(x \u00d7 K k ) \u2243 K k . In [16] it is shown that\n(6.3)\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nn=0\n\nDn = FM .\n\nFix an S \u2208 Sn and f \u2208 Dm , then RS f is a function on the cell S and then\nwhen US is applied to unfold RS f to the entire space we get that it is continuous,\npiecewise differentiable on each \u03b9(I \u00d7 w) for all w \u2208 K k , and constant on mth level\ncells of \u03b9(x \u00d7 K k ) for all x \u2208 I if m > n and constant on nth level cells if n \u2265 m.\nThis means that US RS f \u2208 Dm . Since both RS and US have operator norm less\nthan one and have domains containing all of FM they are continuous operators on\nFM so the invariance extends to all of FM . This is part 1 of Definition 2.5.\nWe next check part 2 of Definition 2.5. Let S1 , S2 \u2208 Sn for some n \u2265 0 and\n\u03a6\u0303 = \u03b9 \u25e6 \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03b9\u22121 and isometry mapping S1 onto S2 . If f \u2208 F S2 the we claim that\npf \u25e6\u03a6\u0303 = pf \u25e6 \u03a6\u0303. Given this claim and the definition of EM as the integral of p2f we\nthen have\n(6.4)\n\nS1\nS2\nEM\n(f, f ).\n(f \u25e6 \u03a6\u0303, f \u25e6 \u03a6\u0303) = Em\n\nWe check the claim on Dm for arbitrary m \u2265 0, the claim extending to all of\nFM by density. On Dm we can view f \u25e6 \u03b9 as a piece-wise differentiable function\nin the I coordinate and piecewise constant in the K k coordinate. Since \u03a6 is an\nisometry of R1+k that maps \u03b9\u22121 (S1 ) onto \u03b9\u22121 (S2 ) it must either be a composition\nof reflections and translations. In the case of \u03a6 being a translation then the claim\nholds because differentiation commutes with translation. In the case of \u03a6 being\na reflection differentiation is anti-commutative, but since the minimal generalized\nupper gradient is pf = \u2202f\n\u2202x the claim holds. Then in the case of composition of\ntranslation and reflection the claim holds.\nPart 3 of Definition 2.5 holds because EM is given by an integral with respect to\na measure that givens no mass to the intersection of cells.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] M.
