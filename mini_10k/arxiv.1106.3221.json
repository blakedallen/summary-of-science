We give a short and direct proof of a remarkable identity that arises in the enumeration of labeled trees with respect to\ntheir indegree sequence, where all edges are oriented from the vertex with lower label towards the vertex with higher label. This\nsolves a problem posed by Shin and Zeng in a recent article. We\nalso provide a generalization of this identity that translates to a\nformula for the number of rooted spanning forests with given indegree sequence.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn a recent paper [5], Shin and Zeng consider the enumeration of\nlabeled trees with respect to their indegree sequence, where each edge\nis oriented towards the vertex whose label is higher. This is called\nthe local orientation of a labeled tree in [5], as opposed to the global\norientation of a rooted labeled tree, in which all edges are oriented\ntowards the root.\nIn both settings, one can define the indegree sequence \u03bb = 1e1 2e2 . . .\n(here, ei is the number of vertices of indegree i) of a rooted tree on\nn labeled vertices, which is always a partition of n \u2212 1. A classical\nrefinement (see for example [6, Corollary 5.3.5]) of Cayley's formula for\nthe number of labeled trees states that the number of rooted labeled\ntrees with fixed root r and global indegree sequence \u03bb is given by\n(n \u2212 1)!2\n,\ne0 !(0!)e0 e1 !(1!)e1 e2 !(2!)e2 . . .\n\n(1)\n\nwhere e0 = n \u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 * * * . Since the relationship between trees\nand maps will also be important in our present context, it is worthwhile pointing out that (1) can be obtained in a very elegant way by\nconsidering functional digraphs, see Section 5.3 of [6] for details.\nShin and Zeng now gave a bijective proof that (1) is also the number\nof labeled trees with local indegree sequence of type \u03bb, a result that\nwas previously conjectured by Cotterill [1] in the context of algebraic\ngeometry and also proved by Du and Yin [2].\nOn the other hand, one has a generating function for labeled trees\nby their local indegree (see [4, Eq. (8)] and also [3, Theorem 4]): let Tn\nbe the set of all labeled trees with labels 1, 2, . . . , n, and let indegT (i)\nbe the local indegree of i in T . Then\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSTEPHAN WAGNER\n\nn\nXY\n\nindegT (i)\n\n= Pn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) = xn\n\nxi\n\nT \u2208Tn i=1\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\n(jxj + xj+1 + * * * + xn ).\n\nj=2\n\nCombining this with (1), one obtains a curious algebraic identity:\nby the type of a monomial xa = xa11 xa22 * * * xann , we mean the partition\n\u03bb = 1e1 2e2 * * * of the monomial's total degree in which ei is the number\nof exponents i in the monomial. Let now \u03bb = 1e1 2e2 * * * be any fixed\npartition of n \u2212 1, and write e0 = n \u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 * * * . Then\nX\n(n \u2212 1)!2\n[xa ]Pn (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) =\n,\n(2)\ne0\ne1\ne2\ne\n0 !(0!) e1 !(1!) e2 !(2!) * * *\na\ntype x =\u03bb\n\nas was pointed out by Shin and Zeng in the aforementioned paper.\nThey asked for a direct proof of this identity, which will be given here.\nIndeed, we prove a slightly more general identity:\n\nTheorem 1. f \u03bb = 1e1 2e2 * * * is any partition of n \u2212 k + 1 and e0 =\nn \u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 * * * , then\nn\nX\nY\nn!(n \u2212 k + 1)!\na\n[x ] (jxj + xj+1 + * * * + xn ) =\n.\ne\ne0 !(0!) 0 e1 !(1!)e1 e2 !(2!)e2 * * *\ntype xa =\u03bb\nj=k\nNote that identity (2) is the special case k = 2 of this theorem.\n2. Proof of the main theorem\nWe use the standard notation [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let us interpret\nthe left hand side in terms of maps from [k..n] = [n] \\ [k \u2212 1] = {k, k +\n1, . . . , n} to itself, with the additional requirement that f (r) \u2265 r for\nall r. Let the set of all such maps be F k,n . Multiply the product out\nto get\nn\nn\nY\nX\nY\n|f \u22121 (j)|\n(jxj + xj+1 + * * * + xn ) =\nxj\n,\nC(f )\nf \u2208F k,n\n\nj=k\n\nj=k\n\nQ\n\nwhere C(f ) = j\u2208Fix f j is the product over all fixed points of f . We\ncan eliminate this coefficient by noting that any map f \u2208 F k,n can\nbe obtained from a map g : [k..n] \u2192 [n] by the rule f (r) = \u03a6g(r) =\nmax(g(r), r), and it is easy to see that each f is obtained from precisely\nC(f ) different maps g. Hence the product can also be written as\nn\nY\n(jxj + xj+1 + * * * + xn ) =\nj=k\n\nX\n\nn\nY\n\n|(\u03a6g)\u22121 (j)|\n\nxj\n\n.\n\ng:[k..n]\u2192[n] j=k\n\nAny map h whose domain is [k..n] induces a set partition on [k..n]\nwhose blocks are precisely the different preimages. Let the type of a\nset partition be the number partition whose elements are the block\n\n\fLABELED TREES, MAPS, AND AN ALGEBRAIC IDENTITY\n\n3\n\nsizes. We have to determine the number of maps g : [k..n] \u2192 [n] such\nthat \u03a6g induces a set partition of type \u03bb.\nIn fact, we can obtain even more: let A = (A1 , A2 , . . . , Am ) be any\nset partition of [k..n] whose type is \u03bb (it follows that m = e1 + e2 +\n* * * = n \u2212 e0 ). Let ai be the largest element of Ai , and assume that\nn = a1 > a2 > * * * > am .\nNow suppose that \u03a6g induces the set partition A. There is only one\npossibility for the value of \u03a6g(A1 ), namely n, hence g(r) = n for all r \u2208\nA1 \\ {n}, but there are n different choices for g(n) = g(a1 ). Likewise,\nthere are n \u2212 a2 choices for \u03a6g(A2) (namely a2 , a2 + 1, . . . , n \u2212 1), but\nif \u03a6g(A2 ) = a2 , one has a2 choices for g(a2 ), so that one has n \u2212 1\npossibilities altogether. Then there are n \u2212 a3 \u2212 1 choices for \u03a6g(A2 ),\nbut a3 choices for g(a3) if \u03a6g(A3 ) = a3 and thus a total of n\u22122 choices,\netc.\nIf follows that the number of possible maps g for which \u03a6g induces\na fixed set partition (A1 , A2 , . . . , Am ) is always\nn(n \u2212 1) * * * (n \u2212 m + 1) =\n\nn!\nn!\n=\n.\n(n \u2212 m)!\ne0 !\n\nFurthermore, there are precisely\n(n \u2212 k + 1)!\ne1 !(1!)e1 e2 !(2!)e2 * * *\nset partitions of [k..n] whose type is \u03bb, which completes the proof.\nBearing in mind that the number of rooted forests with r given roots\non [n] is precisely rnn\u2212r\u22121 , it is natural to ask whether the more general\nidentity has an interpretation for forests. This turns out to be the case:\nlet Tr,n be the set of all rooted labeled forests with labels 1, 2, . . . , n and\nroots 1, 2, . . . , r. We consider the local orientation on these forests.\nAgain by [4, Eq. (8)], one has\nn\nX Y\n\nT \u2208Tr,n i=1\n\nindeg (i)\nxi T\n\n= rxn\n\nn\u22121\nY\n\n(jxj + xj+1 + * * * + xn ).\n\nj=r+1\n\nHence we have the following generalization of the result of Du and\nYin:\nTheorem 2. The number of rooted labeled forests with labels 1, 2, . . . , n\nand roots 1, 2, . . . , r whose type with respect to the local orientation\n(defined in analogy to the type of a labeled tree) is a given partition\n\u03bb = 1e1 2e2 * * * of n \u2212 r is given by\nr(n \u2212 1)!(n \u2212 r)!\n,\ne0 !(0!)e0 e1 !(1!)e1 e2 !(2!)e2 * * *\nwhere again e0 = n \u2212 e1 \u2212 e2 \u2212 * * * .\n\n\f4\n\nSTEPHAN WAGNER\n\nNote that an analogous result holds for the global orientation as well\n(see [6, Corollary 5.3.5]). It is quite probable that the arguments of Du\nand Yin [2] and Shin and Zeng [5] for trees carry over to the case of\nforests as well.\nLet us finally point out a reformulation of Theorem 1 in terms of\nsymmetric functions. Note that the type of a monomial remains unchanged if the variables are permuted. If we consider the symmetrized\npolynomial\nn\n1 XY\n(jx\u03c3(j) + x\u03c3(j+1) + * * * + x\u03c3(n) ),\nn! \u03c3\u2208S j=k\nn\n\nthen all monomials of the same type \u03bb have to have the same coefficient,\nwhich is\n,\nn!\n(n \u2212 k + 1)!\nn!(n \u2212 k + 1)!\n.=\ne\ne\ne\n0\n1\n2\ne0 !(0!) e1 !(1!) e2 !(2!) * * * e0 !e1 !e2 ! * * *\n(1!)e1 (2!)e2 * * *\n\n(dividing by the number of monomials of type \u03bb). This means, however,\nthat\nn\n1 XY\n(jx\u03c3(j) +x\u03c3(j+1) +* * *+x\u03c3(n) ) = (x1 +x2 +* * *+xn )n\u2212k+1. (3)\nn! \u03c3\u2208S j=k\nn\n\nIt might be interesting to study more general expressions of the form\n!\nl\nn\n1 XY X\naij x\u03c3(j)\nn! \u03c3\u2208S i=1 j=1\nn\n\nand see under which conditions the sum simplifies as in (3) (and whether\nthere are any combinatorial interpretations, if this is the case).\nReferences\n\n[1] E.
