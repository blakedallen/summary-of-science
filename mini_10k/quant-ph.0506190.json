The two most common\n\u221a\nexamples of 3-qubit entangled states are the |GHZi = 1/ 2 (|HHHi + |V V V i) [2] and\n\u221a\n|Wi = 1/ 3 (|HV V i + |V HV i + |V V Hi) [3, 4], where |Hi and |V i represent horizontallyand vertically- polarized photon states.\n\nAn important characteristic of 3-particle GHZ\n\nstates is that loss of any one of the qubits leaves the other two in a mixed state with only\nclassical correlations.\n\nIt is well-known that if two qubits are maximally entangled, then\n\nneither can be entangled to a third; the W state is the 3-qubit state in which each pair of\nqubits have the same and maximum amount of bipartite entanglement. This feature makes\nthe entanglement of the W state maximally symmetrically robust against loss of any single\nqubit. It has been shown that the states |GHZi and |Wi represent two distinct classes of\n3-qubit entanglement that cannot be interconverted under any local operations and classical\ncommunication (LOCC)[4, 5]. Experimental realizations of GHZ states and more recently\nW states have been performed in optical and trapped ion experiments [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nWhile conversion of a GHZ state to an exact W state is not possible via LOCC, a\nspecific scheme based on partial quantum measurement (positive operator valued measures\nor POVMs) and classical communication can, however, convert a GHZ state to an arbitrarily\ngood approximation to a W state with a tradeoff between the fidelity of the final state and\nthe probability of success. In any real experiment, where there is inevitable noise in state\nproduction and measurement, arbitrarily good approximations are indistinguishable from\ndirectly-prepared W states. In the present work, we first discuss a POVM scheme, inspired\nby the procrustean method [11], for converting the 3-qubit state |GHZi into an approximate\n|Wi. Then we generalize the scheme to convert between N-qubit analogues of the GHZ and\nW states. Finally, we experimentally apply the POVM scheme to a 3-photon GHZ state\nand characterize the change from the input to the output using quantum state tomography\n[12].\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nIn the diagonal basis, where |Di = 1/ 2 (|Hi + |V i) and |Ai = 1/ 2 (|Hi \u2212 |V i), we\n\ncan rewrite |GHZi = 1/2 (|DDDi + |DAAi + |ADAi + |AADi).\n\nIt is apparent in this\n\nbasis that |GHZi is a superposition of an unwanted term, |DDDi , and a W-state. We\n2\n\n\fdefine a local POVM with elements \u03b51 = |Ai hA| + a2 |Di hD| and \u03b52 = (1 \u2212 a2 ) |Di hD|,\nwhere a is a real number between 0 (perfect measurement) and 1 (no measurement). This\nPOVM is applied to each photon in the state and if all of the parties find element \u03b51 , then\nh\ni\n\u221a\nthe new state is |\u03c8i = N a3 /2 |DDDi + a 3/2 |W\u2032 i ,with the normalization constant,\n\u221a\n\u221a\nN = 2/ a6 + 3a2 . The state |W\u2032 i = 1/ 3 (|DAAi + |ADAi + |AADi) is simply related to\n|Wi by three single-qubit rotations.\n\nIt is clear from this state, that the unwanted term\n\n|DDDi is reduced relative to the term |W\u2032 i. It is also clear that one achieves a pure |W\u2032 i\nonly in the limit as a \u2192 0 where the probability of success also goes to zero. Nevertheless,\n\nthe fidelity of this state with the desired |W\u2032 i is FW\u2032 = |h\u03c8|W\u2032 i|2 = 3/(a4 + 3), which\nrapidly rises from 3/4 to 1 as a decreases, i.e., as the strength of the measurement increases.\nConversely, the fidelity with the GHZ state FGHZ = |h\u03c8|GHZi|2 = (a4 + 6a2 + 9)/(4a4 + 12)\ndrops from 1 to 3/4 as a decreases.\n\nOur method can be generalized to convert an N-qubit GHZ state, |N+i , where |N\u00b1i =\n\u0011\n\u221a \u0010\n1/ 2 |Hi\u2297N \u00b1 |V i\u2297N , into an arbitrarily good approximation to the N-qubit W state\n\u221a\n\u2032\n|WN\ni = 1/ N (|DA...Ai + |AD...Ai + ... + |AA...Di) [13]. We use the fact that the GHZ\nstates |N\u00b1i satisfy the following relation:\n1\n|N\u00b1i = \u221a [|(N-M) +i |M\u00b1i + |(N-M) \u2212i |M\u2213i] ,\n2\nwhere M < N.\n\n(1)\n\nNotice that this factorization preserves the evenness or oddness in the\n\nnumber of negative signs. Through repeated application of these two rules, one can factor\n|N+i in terms of only single-qubit states |Di \u2261 |1+i and |Ai \u2261 |1\u2212i. This reexpresses the\n\nGHZ state as an equally weighted superposition of all 2N \u22121 terms with an even number of\n\n|Ais. When N is odd, the GHZ state can be directly rewritten as,\n\u0015\n\u0014\u221a\nq\n1\n\u2032\nN\n\u22121\n\u2212 N |\u03c6i ,\nN |WN i + 2\n|N+i = \u221a\n2N \u22121\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the state |\u03c6i is a superposition of all those terms containing an odd number and at\nleast 3 |Dis. When N is even, application of a local transformation |Di \u2192 |Ai , |Ai \u2192 |Di\nto any qubit allows the GHZ state to be written in the form of Eq. 2. Applying the same\nlocal POVM as in the 3-qubit case on each of the N qubits, and given that each POVM\nreturns element \u03b51 the unwanted amplitudes by at least a factor of a3 while reducing the\ndesired amplitude by only a single factor of a. In general, the fidelity of the resultant state\n\n3\n\n\f\u2032\nby this prescription with |WN\ni is given by\nN\nFW\n\u2032 =\n\n2a2 N\n(1 + a2 )N \u2212 (1 \u2212 a2 )N\n\nregardless of whether N is even or odd.\nThe details on our experimental method for creating 3-photon GHZ states can be found in\n[14]. Ultraviolet laser pulses from a frequency-doubled Ti:Sapphire laser make two passes\nthrough a type-II phase-matched \u03b2-barium borate (BBO) crystal aligned, with walk-off\nE\n\ncompensation to produce 2-photon pairs each in the Bell state \u03c6+ [15]. These 2 independent photon pairs can be further entangled when combined at the polarizing beamsplitter\n(PBS1) and the four photons take four separate outputs A and B. Recall that a PBS\nworks by reflecting horizontally-polarized light |Hi and transmitting vertically-polarized\nlight |V i.\n\nThus, two photons that were incident from different sides can only pass into\n\ndifferent output modes when their polarizations were both |Hi or both |V i. In this sense,\nthe PBS acts as a quantum parity check [16].\n\nGiven that the parity check succeeds on\n\nthe two photons from the independent pairs, our state is transformed from the product\nE\nE\n\u221a\nto the 4-photon GHZ state |4+i = 1/ 2 (|HHHHiAB14 + |V V V V iAB14 )\n\u03c6+\nstate \u03c6+\n12\n\n34\n\nWe project photon 4 onto the state |Di and when this projection succeeds leaves\n\u221a\n|GHZi = 1/ 2 (|HHHiAB1 + |V V V iAB1 ).\n\n[8].\n\nA tomographically complete set of measurements for a 3-photon polarization state requires 64 polarization measurements.\n\nWe use the 64 combinations of the single-photon\n\nprojections |Hi , |V i , |Di , and |Ri on each of the 3 photons. These projections are implemented using a quarter-wave plate and polarizer for each of photons A and B, and a\nhalf- or quarter-wave plate and PBS2 for photon 1.\n\nSuccessful projections are signalled\n\nby four-photon coincidence measurements, 3 photons for the state and 1 trigger photon,\nusing single-photon counting APDs and coincidence logic. The most-likely physical density\nmatrix for our 3-qubits is extracted using maximum-likelihood reconstruction [17, 18].\nWe begin with the GHZ state that was characterized previously via 3-photon quantum\nstate tomography [14]. We rewrite the density matrix in the |D/Ai basis; this gives the\ndensity matrix shown in Fig. 2b (real part) and 2c (imaginary part). A comparison to the\nideal GHZ written in the same basis is shown in Fig. 2a (real part only, the imaginary part\nis all zero). The colour plots display the absolute value of each element and show that the\ntwo matrices have the same structure.\n4\n\n\fOur POVM was implemented using three partial polarizers.\n\nInstead of orienting the\n\npolarizers in the |D/Ai basis, we rotated the polarization of each photon by 45\u25e6 using halfwave plates. These rotations were accomplished by using the existing half-wave plate in\nmode 1, and by adding two additional half-wave plates in modes A and B. These extra\nrotations allowed the partial polarizers to operate in the |H/V i basis, and therefore our\nPOVM also operates in the |H/V i basis. Each polarizer comprised of two uncoated glass\nmicroscope slides such that the angle of incidence for the input light was at 56\u25e6 , near Brewster's angle (Figure 1). The configuration of the plates are such that the beam experienced\nminimal additional transverse shift and maintained high coupling efficiency into single-mode\nfibres.\n\nSuch partial polarizers have been used to study hidden nonlocality and entangle-\n\nment concentration of maximally-entangled mixed states [19]. We placed each such element\nso that vertically-polarized light was P -polarized and horizontally-polarized light was Spolarized; we measured 88% transmission for the vertically-polarized light and 33% for the\nhorizontally-polarized light. The transmission of the vertical light is thus only 38% of that\nfor the horizontal and we can can describe the experiment using the POVM elements \u03b51 and\n\u03b52 with a2 \u2248 38%. With this attenuation value, and beginning with the ideal GHZ state,\nthe fidelity of the state with the ideal W state given 3 POVM outcomes \u03b51 is expected to\nincrease from 75% to 95%.\nWe used the same 64 tomographic measurement settings for the W state as for the GHZ\nstate. Data for each setting was accumulated for 1800 seconds and yielded a maximum of\n120 four-fold coincidence counts (for the |V V V i projection).\n\nTo account for laser power\n\ndrift, which was small but not insignificant, we divided the four-folds by the square of the\nsingles at the trigger detector. Background four-folds from a two-fold coincidence count and\nan uncorrelated accidental were estimated for each measurement setting and subtracted from\nthe measured coincidences. Using the maximum likelihood reconstruction, our most likely\ndensity matrix is shown in Fig. 3b (real part) and 3c (imaginary part). The ideal W state\ndensity matrix consists of only 9 real elements \u2013 3 diagonals of 1/3 height corresponding to\n|HV V i, |V HV i, and |V V Hi and 6 maximal positive coherences between them. It is clear\nfrom the data that the dominant elements in the density matrix are those same 9 elements.\nIn Fig. 3a., we show the effect of the POVM with our experimentally measured attenuation\non the ideal GHZ state. The diagonal elements are attenuated much more strongly, by a2 ,\nwhile the coherences remain maximal and are thus reduced only by a. Note that one specific\n5\n\n\funwanted term contained in the diagonal element for |V V V i is much more significant after\nthe application of the POVM; this noise contribution, in the ideal case, is untouched by the\nPOVM, and in the real case, least reduced.\nWe characterize the changes in our states using fidelity. The fidelity of a density matrix,\n\u03c1, with a pure quantum state, |\u03c8i, is given by F = h\u03c8| \u03c1 |\u03c8i.\n\nWe calculate this fidelity\n\nwith a general GHZ (W) state, |GHZG i (|WG i), which is related to |GHZi (|Wi) by 3 local\nunitary rotations.\n\nThe initial state has a fidelity of FGHZG = (79.4 \u00b1 1.6) % and FWG =\n\n(60.5 \u00b1 1.9) % as compared with the ideal 100% and 75%. After successful application of\nthree local POVMs, FGHZG = (59.8 \u00b1 2.5) % and FWG = (68.4 \u00b1 2.4) %.\n\nUncertainties\n\nin quantities extracted from these density matrices were calculated using a Monte Carlo\nroutine and assumed Poissonian errors. A theoretical calculation based on our measured\ninitial state and measured a has yields a final state with FWG = 75%. Thus much of the\ndifference with the expected fidelity in the ideal case is a result of the quality of the initial\nstate. Nevertheless, the overlap with a W state has been significantly improved while the\noverlap with a GHZ state has been strongly reduced.\nWe have described a method for converting N-qubit GHZ states to arbitrarily good approximations to N-qubit W states based on generalized quantum measurements (POVMs).\nWe have implemented this scheme for the 3-qubit case and characterized the input and output states using multiphoton quantum state tomography.\n\nWe have quantitatively shown\n\nthat the transformation induced by the partial polarizers results in a decrease in the overlap of the state with a GHZ state while increasing the overlap with the desired W state.\nMultiparticle entanglement is essential to the success of quantum information processing.\nThe theory and experimental work presented here extends our abilities to manipulate and\nunderstand the relationship between different types of complex entangled states.\nThe authors thank Antonio A\u0107in, \u010caslav Brukner, Klaus Hornberger, Morgan Mitchell,\nand Andrew White for valuable discussions.

A double-pass pulsed parametric down-conversion\ncrystal (BBO) is used to create two pairs of polarization-entangled photons both\nE\n\nin the state \u03c6+ .\n\nExtra crystals (COMP) compensate for walkoff effects.\n\nA\n\npolarizing beamsplitter (PBS) performs a parity check on two of the photons,\none from each pair; given that the parity check succeeds, signalled by the two\nphotons taking different output modes, the emerging photons are in a four photon GHZ state. Projection of photon 4 onto the state |Di leaves the remaining\n3 photons in the desired 3-photon GHZ state.\n\nEach photon in the GHZ state\n\nwas rotated locally \u2013 photons A and B were rotated using additional half-wave\nplates (HWP) and photon 1 was rotated using the existing half-wave plate,\nrotating the polarization only 45\u25e6 instead of 90\u25e6 .\nis performed using 3 partial polarizers (PP).\n\nOur 3-qubit local POVM\n\nEach partial polarizer consists\n\nof two microscope slides (MS) mounted such that the light is incident at 56\u25e6 ,\nBrewster's angle for n = 1.5. This configuration had a measured transmission of\n88% for p-polarization and 33% for s-polarization.\n\nEach POVM was oriented\n\nto reduce the horizontal component of the light relative to the vertical component. The three-photon polarization measurements for tomography were taken\nusing quarter-wave plates (QWP) and rotatable polarizers (POL) for photons A\nand B, and a half- or quarter-wave plate and a fixed polarizer (actually a second\nPBS) for photon A before photon-counting detectors (DET and TRIG). A fixed\nQWP is mode A was used to compensate birefringence in the PBS.\nFigure 2. Density matrix of an ideal and experimentally measured 3-photon\nGHZ state.\n\nThe reconstructed density matrix of an a) ideal GHZ state (real\n\npart only) and our measured GHZ state, real part b) & imaginary part c), from\nreference [14]. The state is displayed in the D/A-basis, where D =\nand A =\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n\u221a1\n2\n\n(|Hi + |V i)\n\n(|Hi \u2212 |V i) are defined as in the text. The false colour plots display\n\nthe absolute value of each component of the matrices and are meant to show the\nstructure of the matrix - namely that our GHZ state is characterized in this basis\nby 4 diagonal elements of equal height with maximal positive coherences. The\nexperimentally measured density matrix has a fidelity of 77% with the ideal\n8\n\n\fGHZ state and 79% with any state related to the ideal GHZ state via local\nunitary transformations.\nFigure 3. Density matrix of approximate W output state after the POVM\nprocedure. The reconstructed density matrix of our output state, b) real part\n& c) imaginary part, after the three local POVM operations. The application\nof the POVMs have suppressed several of the matrix components such that the\nfinal state contains only 9 major elements. These are the same 9 elements for\nthe ideal W state.\n\nThe operation has increased the fidelity of our state with\n\na W state from 61% to 68% while at the same time reducing the fidelity of\nour state with a GHZ state from 79% to 60%. For comparison, we show a) the\naction of the POVM operation on the ideal GHZ state. Although this state still\ncontains large coherences with the HHH component, this state has 95% fidelity\nwith the W state.\n\n9\n\n\f\f\f\f"}
