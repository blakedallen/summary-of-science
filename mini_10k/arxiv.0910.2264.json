Introduction\nThe fact that the \u03c4 is the only lepton massive enough to decay into hadrons makes it an excellent tool to study QCD, both perturbative and non-perturbative, using the precise hadronic \u03c4 -decay\ndata provided by ALEPH [1]. The determination of the QCD coupling \u03b1s (M\u03c4 ) [2 \u2013 6], which becomes the most precise determination of \u03b1s (MZ ) after QCD running, is an excellent example. In\nthis particular case the non-perturbative contributions are strongly suppressed, but in other analyses the non-perturbative effects are sizable and then one can extract important phenomenological\nhadronic matrix elements and other non-perturbative QCD quantities. Thanks to the fact that the\nspectral function of the \u03c4 decay can be separated experimentally in its vector and axial-vector\ncontributions, we can study their difference that is specially interesting because it vanishes in perturbative QCD (in the chiral limit) and therefore it is a purely non-perturbative quantity.\nThe \u03c4 -decay measurement of this V \u2212 A spectral function has been used to perform [7 \u2013 9]\nphenomenological tests of the so-called Weinberg sum rules (WSRs) [10], to compute the electromagnetic mass difference of the pions [8], and to determine several QCD vacuum condensates\n[11, 12] relevant for the computation of \u03b5K\u2032 /\u03b5K [13]. The common idea under these studies is the\nuse of the analyticity properties of the different two-point correlation functions appearing in the\ndynamical description of the \u03c4 hadronic width. As it is well known, analyticity allows us to relate\ndifferent regions of the q2 -complex plane. Roughly speaking, one can relate in this way regions\nwhere we are able to compute analytically, either with Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7 PT) or with\nthe short-distance Operator Product Expansion (OPE), with regions where we are not able to compute (except perhaps in the lattice) but that are experimentally accessible. This connection can be\nused either to predict observables that we are not able to calculate \"directly\" or, in the other way\naround, to extract the value of QCD parameters that are not fixed theoretically.\nUsing \u03c7 PT [14 \u2013 16], the hadronic \u03c4 -decay data can also be related to order parameters of the\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking (S\u03c7 SB) of QCD. \u03c7 PT is the effective field theory of QCD\nat very low energies that describes the physics of the S\u03c7 SB Nambu-Goldstone bosons through an\nexpansion in external momenta and quark masses, with coefficients that are order parameters of\nS\u03c7 SB. At lowest order (LO), i.e. O(p2 ), all low-energy observables are described in terms of\nthe pion decay constant f\u03c0 \u2243 92.4 MeV and the light quark condensate. At O(p4 ), the SU(3)\n\u03c7 PT Lagrangian contains 12 low-energy constants (LECs), Li=1,***,10 and H1,2 [16], whereas at\nW\nO(p6 ) we have 94 (23) additional parameters Ci=1,***,94 (Ci=1,***,23\n) in the even (odd) intrinsic parity\nsector [18]. These LECs are not fixed by symmetry requirements alone and have to be determined\nphenomenologically or using non-perturbative techniques. Values for the Li couplings have been\nobtained in the past with an acceptable accuracy (a recent compilation can be found in ref. [19]),\nbut much less well determined are the O(p6 ) couplings Ci .\nThere has been a lot of recent activity to determine the chiral LECs analytically, using as much\nas possible QCD information [20 \u2013 29], and from lattice simulations [40 \u2013 43]. This strong effort\nis motivated by the precision required in present phenomenological applications, which makes\nnecessary to include corrections of O(p6 ) where the huge number of unknown couplings is the\nmajor source of theoretical uncertainty.\nHere we explain how the determination of some of these LECs can be improved significantly\nusing the most recent experimental data on hadronic \u03c4 decays [1]. In particular we will obtain the\n2\n\n\fChiral low-energy constants from tau data\n\nMart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso\n\nmost accurate results for the \u03c7 PT couplings L9 , L10 and C87 or equivalently, in the SU (2) \u03c7 PT\nlanguage, l 5 , l 6 and c50 [30]. Previous work on L10 using \u03c4 -decay data can be found in refs. [8, 9,\n11, 31]. Our analysis is the first one which includes the known two-loop \u03c7 PT contributions and,\ntherefore, provides also the SU(3) (SU(2)) O(p6 ) couplings C87 (c50 ).\nWe will first introduce the sum rule relations that we will use, then we will show our results and\nfinally we will compare them with other recent analytic results and hadronic \u03c4 -data determinations.\n\n2.

The analytic behaviour of this correlator is shown\nin Fig.1, together with the complex circuit that we will use to apply Cauchy's theorem. As we\nare interested in relating the \u03c7 PT domain (very low energies) with the \u03c4 data, we multiply this\ncorrelator by a weight function of the form 1/sn with n > 0. In this way we generate a residue at\ns = 0. Taking into account the OPE associated with our correlator at large momenta and working\nwith the cases n = 1, 2, one gets the following sum rules (see ref. [30] for a careful derivation):\n\neff\n16C87\n\nZ \u221e\nds 1\n\n2 f\u03c02\n+ \u03a0(0) ,\nm2\u03c0\nsth s \u03c0\nZ \u221e\n2 f\u03c02\nd\u03a0\nds 1\nIm\n\u03a0(s)\n=\n+\n\u2261\n(0) ,\n2\n4\nm\u03c0\nds\nsth s \u03c0\n\n\u2212 8 Leff\n10 \u2261\n\nIm \u03a0(s) =\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the integrations start at the threshold sth = 4m2\u03c0 . These two relations represent the starting\neff\npoint of our work and define the effective parameters Leff\n10 and C87 . Their interest stems from the\nfact that the l.h.s. can be extracted from the data (see Section 3), while the r.h.s. can be rigourously\ncalculated within \u03c7 PT in terms of the LECs that we want to determine (see Section 4).\n3\n\n\fChiral low-energy constants from tau data\n\nMart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso\n\n3.

For clarity, we do not include the error bands\nassociated with the modified weights.\n\nWe use the recent ALEPH data on hadronic \u03c4 decays [1], that provide the most precise measurement of the V \u2212 A spectral function. In the integrals of equations (2.2) and (2.3) we are forced\nto cut the integration at a finite value s0 , neglecting in this way the rest of the integral from s0 to\ninfinity. The superconvergence properties of \u03a0(s) at large momenta imply a tiny contribution from\nthe neglected range of integration, provided s0 is large enough. Nevertheless, this generates a theoretical error called quark-hadron duality violation (DV)1 . From the s0 -sensitivity of the effective\nparameters one can assess the size of this error.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the value of Leff\n10 obtained for different values of s0 (solid lines), with the\none-sigma experimental error band, and we can see a quite stable result at s0 &2 GeV2 . The weight\nfunction 1/s decreases the impact of the high-energy region, minimising the DV. The resulting\nintegral is then much better behaved than the corresponding sum rules with sn (n \u2265 0) weights.\nThere are some possible strategies to estimate the value of Leff\n10 and his error. One is to give\nthe predictions fixing s0 at the so-called \"duality points\", two points where the first and second\n\u22123\nWSRs [10] happen to be satisfied. In this way we get Leff\n10 = \u2212(6.50 \u00b1 0.13) * 10 , where the\nuncertainty covers the values obtained at the two \"duality points\". If we assume that the integral\n(2.2) oscillates around his asymptotic value with decreasing oscillations and we perform an average\n\u22123\nbetween the maxima and minima of the oscillations we get Leff\n10 = \u2212(6.5 \u00b1 0.2) * 10 . Another\nway of estimating the DV uses appropriate oscillating functions defined in [33] which mimic the\nreal quark-hadron oscillations above the data. These functions are defined such that they match\nthe data at \u223c 3 GeV2 , go to zero with decreasing oscillations and satisfy the two WSRs. We\n\u22123\nfind in this way Leff\n10 = \u2212(6.50 \u00b1 0.12) * 10 , where the error spans the range generated by the\ndifferent functions used. These estimates are in good agreement with each other and give us a first\ndetermination, but the most precise way to evaluate the error can be obtained taking advantage\nof the WSRs to construct modified sum rules with weight factors w(s) proportional to (1 \u2212 s/s0 ),\nin order to suppress numerically the role of the suspect region around s \u223c s0 [3]. Fig. 2 shows\nthe results obtained with w1 (s) \u2261 (1\u2212s/s0 ) /s (dashed line) and w2 (s) \u2261 (1\u2212s/s0 )2 /s (dot-dashed\nline). These weights give rise to very stable results over a quite wide range of s0 values. One gets\nbut equivalent perspective, we are assuming that the OPE is a good approximation for \u03a0(s) at any\n|s|=s0 , what is not expected to happen near the real axis, and that produces the DV.\n1 From a different\n\n4\n\n\fChiral low-energy constants from tau data\n\nMart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso\n\n\u22123 using w (s) and Leff = \u2212(6.45 \u00b1 0.06) * 10\u22123 using w (s).

[32] to calculate in \u03c7 PT the r.h.s. of equations (2.2) and (2.3), we get\nr\n4\n6\n6\n6\n\u2212 8 Leff\n10 = \u2212 8 L10 (\u03bc ) + G1L (\u03bc ) + G0L (\u03bc ) + G1L (\u03bc ) + G2L (\u03bc ) ,\neff\n16 C87\n\n=\n\n4\nH1L\n+\n\n6\n6\nr\n(\u03bc ) + H2L\n(\u03bc )\n16 C87\n(\u03bc ) + H1L\n\n,\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\nm\nm\nwhere the functions Gm\nnL (\u03bc ), HnL (\u03bc ) are corrections of order p generated at the n-loop level, which\nexplicit analytic form [30] is omitted for simplicity.\nWorking at O(p4 ), the determination of the chiral coupling L10 is straightforward. One gets\n\nLr10 (\u03bc = M\u03c1 ) = \u2212(5.22 \u00b1 0.06) * 10\u22123 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nAt order p6 , the numerical relation is more involved because the small corrections G60L,1L (\u03bc )\ncontain some LECs that represent the main source of uncertainty for Lr10 . It is useful to classify the O(p6 ) contributions through their ordering within the 1/NC expansion. The tree-level\nterm G60L (\u03bc ) contains the only O(p6 ) correction in the large\u2013NC limit, 4m\u03c02 (Cr61 \u2212Cr12 \u2212Cr80 );\nthis correction is numerically small because of the m2\u03c0 suppression and can be estimated with a\nmoderate accuracy [25, 26, 32, 34, 35]. At NLO G60L (\u03bc ) contributes with a term of the form\nr \u2212C r \u2212C r ). In the absence of information about these LECs we will adopt the conservam2K (C62\n13\n81\nr \u2212C r \u2212C r | \u2264 |C r \u2212C r \u2212C r |/3, which generates the uncertainty that will dominate\ntive range |C62\n13\n81\n61\n12\n80\nour final error on Lr10 . Also at this order in 1/NC there is the one-loop correction G61L (\u03bc ), that is\nproportional to Lr9 which is better known [36]. Calculating the 1/NC2 suppressed two-loop function\nG62L (\u03bc ) and taking all these contributions into account we finally get the wanted O(p6 ) result:\nLr10 (M\u03c1 ) = \u2212(4.06 \u00b1 0.04Leff \u00b1 0.39LECs ) * 10\u22123 = \u2212(4.06 \u00b1 0.39) * 10\u22123 ,\n10\n\nwhere the error has been split into its two main components.\n5\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fChiral low-energy constants from tau data\n\nMart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso\n\nA recent reanalysis of the decay \u03c0 + \u2192 e+ \u03bd\u03b3 [35], using new experimental data, has provided\nquite accurate values for the combination L9 + L10 , both at order p4 and p6 , that combined with our\nresults for Lr10 (M\u03c1 ) give us\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 (6.54 \u00b1 0.15) * 10\u22123\n[O(p4 )],\nr\n(4.5)\nL9 (M\u03c1 ) =\n\uf8f3 (5.50 \u00b1 0.40) * 10\u22123\n[O(p6 )].\nr (where the only LEC involved is Lr ) we get\nRepeating the process we have done for Lr10 with C87\n9\nr\nC87\n(M\u03c1 ) = (4.89 \u00b1 0.19) * 10\u22123 GeV\u22122 .\n\n(4.6)\n\n5. SU(2) \u03c7 PT\nUp to now, we have discussed the LECs of the usual SU(3) \u03c7 PT (\u03c7 PT3 ). It turns useful to consider also the effective low-energy theory with only two flavours of light quarks (\u03c7 PT2 ). In some\ncases, this allows to perform high-accuracy phenomenological determinations of the corresponding\nLECs at NLO. Moreover, recent lattice simulations [43, 42] with two dynamical quarks are already\nable to obtain the SU(2) LECs with sufficient accuracy and this is an important check for them.\nIn SU(2) \u03c7 PT, there are ten LECs, li=1,..7 and h1,2,3 , at O(p4 ) (NLO) [15]. Using the O(p6 )\nrelation between l5r (\u03bc ) and Lr10 (\u03bc ), recently obtained in ref. [37], we get\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 13.30 \u00b1 0.11\n[O(p4 )],\n(5.1)\nl5 =\n\uf8f3 12.24 \u00b1 0.21\n[O(p6 )].\nAnalogously to the SU (3) case, the combination l 6 \u2212 l 5 has been determined from the analysis of\n\u03c0 \u2192 l \u03bd\u03b3 [44]. In combination with our determinations for l 5 this gives us2\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 15.80 \u00b1 0.29\n[O(p4 )],\n(5.2)\nl6 =\n\uf8f3 15.22 \u00b1 0.39\n[O(p6 )].\n\nr\nC87\n\nMaking use of the recent results obtained in reference [37] we can also rewrite our result for\nin the \u03c7 PT2 language, getting in this way the first determination of cr50\ncr50 (M\u03c1 ) = (4.95 \u00b1 0.19) * 10\u22123 GeV\u22122 .\n\n(5.3)\n\n6. Summary and comparison with previous estimates\nTables 1 and 2 summarize our determinations of chiral LECs at O(p6 ) and O(p4 ), respectively.\nThey have been obtained through a sum rule analysis that only uses general properties of QCD and\nthe measured V \u2212A spectral function [1], and taking into account the results of refs. [35, 44].\nOur determination of Lr10 (l 5 ) is the first one extracted from \u03c4 -decay data at O(p6 ). We can\nmake an indirect and interesting check comparing our O(p6 ) result for Lr9 (l 6 ) with the value\n2 Actually, at order\n\ncombination L9 + L10\n\np4 , the most precise value of the combination l 6 \u2212 l 5 is obtained if we calculate it from the SU(3)\nof ref. [35]. In this way we have obtained a prediction for l 6 that supersedes that of ref. [30].\n\n6\n\n\fChiral low-energy constants from tau data\n\nMart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso\n\n\u03c7 PT2\nl 5 = 12.24 \u00b1 0.21\nl 6 = 15.22 \u00b1 0.39\nr\nc50 = (4.95 \u00b1 0.19) * 10\u22123 GeV\u22122\n\n\u03c7 PT3\nr\nL10 (M\u03c1 ) = \u2212(4.06 \u00b1 0.39) * 10\u22123\nLr9 (M\u03c1 ) = (5.50 \u00b1 0.40) * 10\u22123\nr (M ) = (4.89 \u00b1 0.19) * 10\u22123 GeV\u22122\nC87\n\u03c1\n\nTable 1: Results for the \u03c7 PT LECs obtained at O(p6 ).\n\n\u03c7 PT2\nl 5 = 13.30 \u00b1 0.11\nl 6 = 15.80 \u00b1 0.29\n\n\u03c7 PT3\nr\nL10 (M\u03c1 ) = \u2212(5.22 \u00b1 0.06) * 10\u22123\nLr9 (M\u03c1 ) = (6.54 \u00b1 0.15) * 10\u22123\n\nTable 2: Results for the \u03c7 PT LECs obtained at O(p4 ).\n\nLr9 (M\u03c1 ) = (5.93 \u00b1 0.43) * 10\u22123 (l 6 = 16.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 0.7) obtained from the charge radius of the\npion [36] ([45]). The agreement is very good and the improvement in the numerical value of l 6 is\nremarkable.\nAt order p4 we do have a previous estimate of Lr10 from \u03c4 data [8] that found Lr10 (M\u03c1 ) =\n\u2212(5.13 \u00b1 0.19) * 10\u22123 , through a simultaneous fit of this parameter and the OPE corrections of\ndimensions six and eight to several spectral moments of the hadronic distribution. This determination is in good agreement with our O(p4 ) result. Our quoted uncertainty has an smaller experimental contribution and includes a better assessment of the theoretical uncertainties. We can\nalso perform an indirect check through the comparison of our O(p4 ) result for Lr9 with the value\nLr9 (M\u03c1 ) = (6.9 \u00b1 0.7) * 10\u22123 obtained from the charge radius of the pion [19]. We see again a very\ngood agreement and a clear improvement in the precision.\nIf we shift now from phenomenology to theory, we can compare our results with those obtained\nr (M )\nfrom analytical approaches and lattice simulations. Our determinations of Lr10 (M\u03c1 ) and C87\n\u03c1\nagree within errors with the large\u2013NC estimates based on lowest-meson dominance [21, 24, 32, 38],\nL10 \u2248 \u22123 f\u03c02 /(8MV2 ) \u2248 \u22125.4 * 10\u22123 and C87 \u2248 7 f\u03c02 /(32MV4 ) \u2248 5.3 * 10\u22123 GeV\u22122 , and with the result of ref. [28] for C87 , based on Pad\u00e9 approximants. These predictions however are unable\nto fix the scale dependence which is of higher-order in 1/NC . More recently the resonance chiral theory Lagrangian [24, 39] has been used to analyse the correlator \u03a0(s) at NLO order in the\n1/NC expansion. Matching the effective field theory description with the short-distance QCD behaviour, both LECs are determined, keeping full control of the \u03bc -dependence. The predicted values\nr (M ) = (3.6 \u00b1 1.3) * 10\u22123 GeV\u22122 [29] are in perfect agreeLr10 (M\u03c1 ) = \u2212(4.4 \u00b1 0.9) * 10\u22123 and C87\n\u03c1\nment with our results, although less precise.\nThe most recent lattice calculations find the following results (order p4 ):\n(\n\u2212(5.2 \u00b1 0.5) * 10\u22123\n[40] ,\nLr10 (M\u03c1 ) =\n\u22123\n\u2212(5.7 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b1 0.7) * 10\n[41] ,\n(\n14.9 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b1 0.7\n[42] ,\nl6 =\n(6.1)\n11.9 \u00b1 0.7 \u00b1 1.0\n[43] .\nThey are in good agreement with our determinations (although still far from the phenomenological\nprecision), but for the last one that is slightly smaller. As discussed in ref. [43], this is partly due to\n7\n\n\fChiral low-energy constants from tau data\n\nMart\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez-Alonso\n\nthe deviation of the lattice determination of the pion decay constant from the \u03c7 PT one.\nTherefore we can conclude that the different analytical approaches and the various lattice\ncalculations agree very well with our precise phenomenological values.\n\nAcknowledgements\nM.
