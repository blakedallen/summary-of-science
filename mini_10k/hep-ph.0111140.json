The f2 is described by a symmetric real tensor\nfield f\u03bc\u03bd with perturbative mass M . Its chiral invariant\ninteraction to pions at lowest order in derivatives is [4]\n\nChiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT) [1,2] is a powerful tool to describe low energy hadronic interactions.\nChPT is based on the identification of pions, kaons\nand the eta as the Goldstone Bosons associated to the\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of QCD (pseudoGoldstone bosons indeed, since the three lightest have a\nsmall mass). The ChPT Lagrangian is then built as a\nderivative and mass expansion over the symmetry breaking scale 4\u03c0F \u2243 1.2GeV, compatible with the symmetry\nconstraints. The calculations are renormalizable order by\norder and depend on just a finite set of parameters at each\norder, which can be determined from a few experiments\nand then used to obtain predictions for other processes.\nThese parameters contain information on heavier states\nnot included explicitly in the Lagrangian [1,3,4].\nIn this work, and within the context of SU (2) ChPT\n(the u and d quark sector), we first study the contribution from the I = 0, J = 2 lightest resonance to the\nchiral parameters, using a resonant model that describes\nwell the data on that channel. Next, we study how, by\nmeans of unitarization methods, it is possible to generate\na resonance from the ChPT expansion in the I = 0, J = 2\nchannel. Although these techniques, and particularly the\nInverse Amplitude Method, have been extensively applied in the literature, obtaining remarkable descriptions\nof meson-meson scattering, they had never been applied\nto this channel. The reasons were that the lowest chiral\norder vanishes, so that the formalism has to be generalized, and that the first contribution to the imaginary part\nof the amplitude appears at three loops, where there are\nno calculations available.

Therefore a\npossible phenomenological approach to this channel is\na model where a J = 2, I = 0 resonance is introduced\nexplicitly in a chiral invariant way. In a first approximation we will neglect the kaons since their branching ratio\nfrom the f2 (1270) is about 5%.

Nevertheless, the f2 contributions are comparable to those of\nscalar resonances [3,4]. At O(p6 ), \u03c0\u03c0 scattering can be\nparametrized with six constants bi [8].

Let us now see\nhow we can also generate a resonance from ChPT.\n\nF 2g2\n\u2243 \u22126.8 \u00d7 10\u22126 ,\nMf4\n\nThe Inverse Amplitude Method for channels with\nvanishing lowest order\n\nwhereas that of the \u03c1 is\n\nWithin ChPT the amplitude is an expansion\n\nF 2f 2\n1\n\u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\u2206b5 = \u2206b6 =\n3\n4M\u03c14\n\naChP T (s) = a2 (s) + a4 (s) + a6 (s) + a8 (s) + ...\n\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere ak (s) stands for the O(pk ) contribution, or more\nprecisely, the O(1/F k ) term. For s > 4M\u03c02 , aChP T only\nsatisfies unitarity, eq(3), in a perturbative sense:\nIm a2 = 0,\nIm a4 = a2 \u03c3a2 ,\n\nIm a6 = a2 \u03c3a\u22174 + a4 \u03c3a2 ,\nIm a8 = a2 \u03c3a\u22176 + a6 \u03c3a2 + a4 \u03c3a\u22174 ,\n\nHowever, the IAM has not been derived or applied\nwhen a2 = 0. In what follows, we will present a generalization of the IAM equation and its derivation for the\ncase when a2 = 0. In particular we will apply the method\nto the I = 0, J = 2 channel. In this case it is possible\nto write a dispersion relation for the chiral expansion up\nto O(p8 ) (with five subtractions to ensure convergence).\nAs discussed before, the first non-vanishing contribution\nto Im a on the right cut comes from a8 , eq.(7). Thus the\nright cut contribution to this dispersion relation is\nZ\n(s \u2212 s0 )5 \u221e a4 (s\u2032 )\u03c3(s\u2032 )a4 (s\u2032 )ds\u2032\na8R (s) =\n\u2032\n5 \u2032\n\u03c0\n4M\u03c02 (s \u2212 s0 ) (s \u2212 s \u2212 i\u01eb)\n\n(5)\n...\n\nIn the elastic region, all the contributions to Im aChP T\ncome from the two pion loop function J(s). Indeed, by\nanalyzing the different Feynman diagrams contributing\nto eq.(4) it is possible to write a4 = a2 J a2 + a4L , where\na4L contains the polynomial and the left cut contribution\nto a4 but is real when s > 4M\u03c02 . This is due to the fact\nthat we can only get the imaginary part from one loop\n(one J(s)) with two vertices of O(p2 ) (the two a2 factors),\nand the rest has to be real if s > 4M\u03c02 . Similarly\na6 = a2 Ja2 Ja2 + 2a4L Ja2 + a6L ,\na8 = a2 Ja2 Ja2 Ja2 + 3a4L Ja2 Ja2\n+2a6L Ja2 + a4L Ja4L + a8L ,\n\nwhere we have used the second relation in eq.(7) and s0 is\na subtraction point. This strongly suggest the use of the\nauxiliary function G \u2261 a24 a\u22121 , since Im G = \u2212Im a8 on\nthe right cut. Writing another dispersion relation (with\nfive subtractions) for G, its right cut contribution will\nbe precisely \u2212a8R . Neglecting the possible pole contribution and evaluating the left cut and the polynomial\ncontributions perturbatively it is not hard to find\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the akL include the corresponding left cut and\npolynomial contributions, are renormalization scale independent and real on the right cut. Note that Im J(s) =\n\u03c3(s) for s > 4M\u03c02 so that eqs.(5) follow immediately.\nA case of special interest for this work occurs when\na2 = 0. Then a4L = a4 and Im a4 = 0 in the physical\nregion. The same happens with a6 . Thus the first right\ncut contribution comes from a8 , which satisfies\na8 = a4 Ja4 + a8L ,\n\nIm a8 = a4 \u03c3a4 ,\n\n\u2200s > 4M\u03c02 ,\n\nG \u2243 a4 \u2212 a6 \u2212 a8 +\n\na26\n, \u21d2 \u00e3 =\na4\n1\u2212\n\na4\na6\na4\n\n\u2212\n\na8\na4\n\n+\n\na26\na24\n\n(8)\n\nThis is the generalized expression for the IAM, which is\nexactly unitary and has the correct low energy expansion\nrequired by ChPT, i.e., eq.(4) with a2 = 0.\nAlternatively, the unitarized amplitude above could be\nderived by considering the [2, 2] Pad\u00e9 approximant of the\nchiral expansion in 1/F 2 , namely\n\n(7)\n\nActually, this occurs for I = 0, J = 2 where the chiral\nexpansion starts at O(p4 ), i.e., a = a4 + a6 + a8 + ...\nIn order to improve the unitary behavior of the chiral expansion one of the most widely used techniques is\nthe Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM). Its name is due to\nthe fact that a\u22121\nIJ has the same analytic structure as aIJ\n(apart from eventual new poles coming from the amplitude zeros). In particular, it should also have a right cut\non s > 4M\u03c02 , where Im a\u22121 = \u2212\u03c3 due to eq.(3).\nThe IAM can be derived with the help of an auxiliary\nfunction G \u2261 a22 a\u22121 which satisfies a dispersion relation\nwith exactly the same right cut contribution as a2 \u2212 a4 ,\nsince a2 is real and Im a\u22121 = \u2212\u03c3. Indeed, if the left cut\ncontribution and the polynomial part of G are evaluated\nperturbatively we arrive to G \u2243 a2 \u2212 a4 . Hence we find a\nunitarized amplitude \u00e3 = a22 /(a2 \u2212a4 ). The details of this\nderivation can be found in [9]. Let us simply recall that\nthis simple formula has been applied to the \u03c0\u03c0 and \u03c0K\nelastic scattering [9], and it generates the \u03c3, \u03c1 and K \u2217\nresonances from the corresponding O(p4 ) amplitudes. A\nsimilar equation in matrix form, although without a justification from dispersion theory, has also been applied\nwithin a coupled channel formalism, describing successfully all the meson-meson interactions below 1200 MeV\nand generating seven light resonances [10]. In addition,\nthis method has also been generalized both to O(p6 ) calculations for the lowest spin channels where a2 6= 0 [9,11].\n\na[2,2] =\n\na2 a4 \u2212 a22 a6 + a34 \u2212 2a2 a4 a6 + a22 a8\na24 \u2212 a2 a6 + a2 a8 \u2212 a4 a6 + a26 \u2212 a4 a8\n\nand then setting a2 = 0\nResults and conclusion\n\nIn what follows we are going to confront eq.(8) with the\nI = 0, J = 2 scattering data. However, at present there is\nno calculation of a8 available, and probably it will remain\nunavailable for a long time. However from eq.(6) we see\nthat only a8L is unknown.\n\u221a Since we will be interested\non the resonant region, s \u2243 1200MeV, we can expect\nthat the left cut logarithmic contribution will be small.\nConcerning the polynomial, we also expect the dominant\nterm to be a8L \u223c c s4 , since any other polynomial term\nwill be suppressed by powers of M\u03c02 /s. Since ChPT is\nan expansion in powers of momenta over 4\u03c0F we get a\ncrude estimate of c \u2243 (1/4\u03c0F )8 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u221225 MeV\u22128 .\nThus, in Fig.1 (dashed line) we compare the I = 0, J =\n2 phase shift data with the results of applying eq.(8) to\nthe ChPT amplitude with the parameters listed as set I\nin Table I. It is possible to get a remarkable description\nof the experiment, but it is not so good when comparing\nwith the values given in the literature, listed in column\n3\n\n\f2\n\n10 b1\n102 b2\n103 b3\n103 b4\n104 b5\n104 b6\n\nO(p6 ) ChPT [8]\n-9.2 ... -8.6\n8.0 ... 8.9\n-4.3 ... -2.6\n4.8 ... 7.1\n-0.4 ... 2.3\n0.7 ... 1.5\n\nO(p6 ) IAM [11]\n\u22127.7 \u00b1 1.3\n7.3 \u00b1 0.7\n\u22121.8 \u00b1 1.6\n4.8 \u00b1 0.1\n1.3 \u00b1 0.2\n0.2 \u00b1 0.2\n\nset I\n-3\n4\n3.8\n7\n8.7\n1.6\n\nset II\n-6.6\n6.4\n-3.6\n6.7\n4.0\n1.5\n\nTABLE I. Estimates of the O(p6 ) parameters are given\nin column two. In the third column we give values that,\nwith the IAM up to O(p6 ), fit very well \u03c0\u03c0 scattering in the\n(I, J) = (0, 0), (1, 1) and (2, 0) channels. Set I with eq.(8) describes remarkably well the I = 0, J = 2 data, but only agrees\nin the order of magnitude with previous values. Set II agrees\nbetter with [11], but yields a narrower resonance (see Fig.1),\ndue to other coupled states not present in our approach.\n\nFIG. 1. Experimental data ( [12] squares,[13] circles, [14]\ntriangles) on the , I = 0, J = 2 \u03c0\u03c0 scattering phase shift and\nthe results of our unitarized chiral resonance model (continuous line), of eq.(8) with the parameters in set I (dashed line),\nand with those in set II (dotted line)\n\nparticular, is applicable to channels with vanishing lowest order. When applied to the I = 0, J = 2 channel,\nthe IAM is able to generate a resonant behavior from the\nchiral expansion, in agreement with the data, taking into\naccount that we are only considering the two pion state.\nThis is an illustration of the power of this unitarization\nmethod which still gives qualitative results even close to\nits applicability limits.\n\ntwo and three of the same table. Nevertheless, our parameters have the correct order of magnitude. Let us\nalso remark that there are just six free parameters up to\nO(p6 ), with rather large uncertainties. However, such an\naccurate description of the data is somewhat unrealistic.\nThe reason is that in our approach we are only taking\ninto account the \u03c0\u03c0 state, whereas the actual f2 resonance has 8% and 7% branching ratios to four pions and\ntwo kaons, respectively. Just with pions, we should expect to get a 15% narrower resonance. We show in Fig.1,\nas a dotted line, the result of applying eq.(8) with set II\nin Table I. These parameters are compatible with those\ngiven in the literature, and from Fig.1, we see that, actually, they yield a narrower resonance, consistently with\nour expectations. The introduction of the K K\u0304 or the 4\u03c0\ncoupled states is beyond the scope of this work.\nThe final consistency check is the value of the c parameter. As a matter of fact we have found many sets\nof parameters yielding results either like the dashed or\nthe dotted lines in Fig.1. For all of them, c \u2243 10\u221225 to\n10\u221224 MeV\u22128 , in good agreement with our expectations.\nThe consistency of the whole picture is more remarkable\ntaking into account the experimental errors, not given in\nthe original references, but that could be roughly estimated by comparing the difference on the data points in\nthe overlapping region of different experiments (see Fig.1\nbetween 1000 and 1200 MeV).\nIn summary, in this work we have studied a chiral\nmodel with a I = 0, J = 2 resonance which describes\nthe \u03c0\u03c0 scattering data on that channel. We have then\ncalculated the resonance contributions to the chiral parameters that govern \u03c0\u03c0 scattering at one and two loops,\nfinding that, as expected, they are subdominant with respect to those of vector mesons (that is vector meson\ndominance), but comparable with the contributions from\nscalar resonances. We have also given a generalization of\nthe Inverse Amplitude Method to higher orders, which, in\n\nAcknowledgments.\n\nWork supported from the Spanish CICYT projects\nFPA2000-0956, PB98-0782 and BFM2000-1326.\n[1] S.
