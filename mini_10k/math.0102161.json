Here X := HD\n([0, \u03c0]) stands for\nthe set of functions that satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions and\nwhose derivatives are in L2 ([0, \u03c0]). For generic nonlinearities f , C = \u222aCk\ndecomposes into manifolds of codimension 1 in X. If f \u2032\u2032 < 0 or f \u2032\u2032 > 0, the\nset Cj is shown to be non-empty if, and only if, \u2212j 2 (the j-th eigenvalue\nof u\u2032\u2032 ) is in the range of f \u2032 . The critical components Ck are (topological)\nhyperplanes.\n\nLet \u03a9 \u2282 Rn be a bounded, smooth domain, f \u2208 C k (R), k \u2265 2, and g : \u03a9 \u2192 R\nbe two given functions. Since the pioneering work of Ambrosetti-Prodi ([1]), the\nnonlinear problem\n\u2212\u2206u + f (u) = g,\n\nu|\u2202\u03a9 = 0,\n\nhas been studied by various methods of nonlinear analysis in the case\n\u03c3(\u2212\u2206) \u2229 f \u2032 (R) 6= \u2205.\n(\u03c3(\u2212\u2206) stands for the spectrum of \u2212\u2206).\nIn this paper we deal with the one dimensional version of this problem,\nnamely\n\u2212u\u2032\u2032 + f (u) = g(t),\n\nu(0) = u(\u03c0) = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nThere exists an extensive literature concerning this problem (see, for example,\n[4], [8], and references therein). Usually one obtains a priori estimates on the\nnonlinearity, which result in bounds on the number of solutions of (1).\nDespite the success of the different methods used in this problem, they do\nnot give insight into the nature of the change in the number of solutions of\n\u2217 Supported\n\nin part by CNPq-Brazil, FINEP and FAPERJ.\n\n1\n\n\f(1), which was one of the major features of the work of Ambrosetti and Prodi,\nas well as subsequent work of Berger and Podolak ([2]). There is a certain\nreappraisal in recent years ([3], [7],[8]) of the Ambrosetti-Prodi method. This\npaper, whose approach is also geometric, may be seen as a portion of a larger\nproject, inspired by some techniques and methods also present in [6]. For a\nfirst order differential equation, these authors characterized the critical set C,\nthen studied of the stratification of C by different Morin singularities and finally\nconsidered the geometry of the image of the critical set.\nHere we address only the first part of this project: for convex or concave\nnonlinearities, we characterize the critical set C of the Sturm-Liouville operator\nF : X\nu\n\n\u2192\nY\n7\u2192 \u2212u\u2032\u2032 + f (u),\n\n2\ndefined in the Sobolev space X := HD\n([0, \u03c0]) of functions that satisfy the Dirichlet boundary conditions and whose second derivatives are in Y := L2 ([0, \u03c0]).\nThe results also hold for different pairs of spaces without difficulty.\nOur main result may be synthesized as follows\n\nTheorem A: Suppose that the nonlinearity f satisfies f \u2032\u2032 > 0 or f \u2032\u2032 < 0.\nThen the critical set C of the operator F decomposes into connected components Cj , associated to the free eigenvalues {12 , 22 , . . . } belonging to the range\nof \u2212f \u2032 . Each Ck is a (topological) hyperplane, which admits a simple explicit\nparametrization by functions of average zero.\nIf 1 is the only square integer in the range of \u2212f \u2032 , Theorem A is part of\nthe proof of the original Ambrosetti-Prodi Theorem. If f \u2032 crosses only the first\nm square integers, the result was obtained by Ruf ([8],Proposition 9), by using\ndifferent techniques. In a forthcoming paper, Burghelea, Saldanha and Tomei\nprove that, for arbitrary generic nonlinearities, the components of the critical\nset are still topological hyperplanes parametrized by square integers in the range\nof \u2212f \u2032 . The arguments do not have the same expliciteness than those presented\nin this paper, and depend strongly on special properties of infinite dimensional\ntopology.\nIn a sense, this paper is a nonlinear version of oscillation theory: as the\nfunction u varies in X, consider the argument of a nonzero solution of the\nlinearized equation \u2212v \u2032\u2032 + f \u2032 (u)v = 0, v(0) = 0 at t = \u03c0. It turns out that this\nargument has monotonicity properties similar to those of the usual argument\nof a Sturm-Liouville solution when the potential varies so that it is increased\npointwise.\nWe are not concerned, in this paper, with the study of the image of the\ncritical sets Ck . In the n-dimensional case, for f \u2032\u2032 > 0 or f \u2032\u2032 < 0, the image\nof F (C1 ) is studied in [3]. For arbitrary interactions between f \u2032 and \u03c3(\u2206), the\nimage N := F (C1 ) turns out to be a codimension 1 manifold, which is globally\nparametrized by the functions of average zero. For functions g on one side of N\nthere is no solution u \u2208 X for the equation F (u) = g, while on the other side\nthere is at least one solution. This result was obtained by Berger-Podolak ([2])\nin the original Ambrosetti-Prodi context, i.e., when C = C1 .\nWhen f \u2032 interacts with the j first eigenvalues of the free Laplacian, the\nclassification of the singularities in Ck is still an open problem, even in the one\n2\n\n\fdimensional case. It is well known that C1 consists only of fold points. Also,\nhigher singularities do appear in Ck , k = 2, . . . , j, but the Morin type of the\nsingularities which may occur is unknown (see [8]).\n\n1\n\nStatements and proofs\n\nA simple computation obtains the derivative of F at u,\nDF (u) : X\nw\n\n\u2192\nY\n7\n\u2192\n\u2212w\u2032\u2032 + f \u2032 (u)w.\n\nThe characterization of the critical points of F is then a consequence of Fredholm\ntheory applied to Sturm-Liouville operators. Thus, u \u2208 C if, and only if, the\nkernel of DF (u) is non-trivial. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, the spectrum\nis simple. Define v(u)(t) as the solution of the linearized equation\n\u2212[v(u)]\u2032\u2032 (t) + f \u2032 (u(t))v(u)(t) = 0,\n\nv(u)(0) = 0, [v(u)]\u2032 (0) = 1.\n\n(2)\n\nThe simplicity of the spectrum of DF (u) guarantees that, if v(u)(\u03c0) = 0, then\nker DF (u) is spanned by v(u)(t). Following Pr\u00fcfer ([5]), let W : X \u00d7 [0, \u03c0] \u2192 R\nbe the continuously defined argument of the planar vector ([v(u)]\u2032 (t), v(u)(t)),\nwith W (u)(0) = 0. It follows that u \u2208 C, the critical set, if, and only if,\nW (u)(\u03c0) = k\u03c0, k \u2208 N\u2217 := {1, 2, 3, . . . }. We define, for all \u03b8 \u2208 R, the level sets\nM\u03b8 := {u \u2208 X; W (u)(\u03c0) = \u03b8}.\nThe critical set then decomposes into\nCk := Mk\u03c0 = {u \u2208 X; W (u)(\u03c0) = k\u03c0, k \u2208 N\u2217 }.\n\nTheorem B: Let f \u2208 C r (R), r \u2265 2 be a function such that f \u2032\u2032 (0) 6= 0. Then\nM\u03b8 (in particular, each Ck ) is either empty or a C r -manifold of codimension 1\nin X. If, however, f \u2032\u2032 (0) = 0 and the two conditions below hold,\n(a) the root 0 of f \u2032\u2032 is isolated,\n(b) f \u2032 (0) 6= \u2212j 2 , j \u2208 N\u2217 ,\nthen the same conclusion is valid for the critical sets Ck .\nProof. We calculate DW (u)(\u03c0). Differentiation produces\nDW (u)(\u03c0) * \u03c6 =\n\n[v(u)]\u2032 (\u03c0).[Dv(u) * \u03c6](\u03c0) \u2212 v(u)(\u03c0).[Dv(u) * \u03c6]\u2032 (\u03c0)\n.\n{v(u)(\u03c0)}2 + {[v(u)]\u2032 (\u03c0)}2\n\nIn order to obtain [Dv(u) * \u03c6](\u03c0) and [Dv(u) * \u03c6]\u2032 (\u03c0), we differentiate problem\n2\n(2) with respect to u: for all \u03c6 \u2208 XD\n,\n\u0001\n\u2212D [v(u)]\u2032\u2032 * \u03c6 + [f \u2032\u2032 (u).\u03c6].v(u) + f \u2032 (u).(Dv(u) * \u03c6) = 0\n(Dv(u) * \u03c6)(0) = 0, [Dv(u) * \u03c6]\u2032 (0) = 0,\n\n3\n\n\fDenoting \u03bc = \u03bc(u, \u03c6) = Dv(u) * \u03c6 \u2208 X 2 , we are thus led to the initial value\nproblem\n\u2212\u03bc\u2032\u2032 + f \u2032 (u).\u03bc = \u2212[f \u2032\u2032 (u).\u03c6].v(u)\n\u03bc(0) = 0, \u03bc\u2032 (0) = 0,\nwhich can be solved by variation of constants. The expressions we want to\ncalculate are evaluations of \u03bc and \u03bc\u2032 at \u03c0. We find\nZ \u03c0\n\u22121\nDW (u)(\u03c0) * \u03c6 =\nf \u2032\u2032 (u(r)).\u03c6(r).[v(u)(r)]2 dr.\n{v(u)(\u03c0)}2 + {[v(u)]\u2032 (\u03c0)}2 0\nThus DW (u)(\u03c0) \u2261 0 if, and only if, f \u2032\u2032 (u) \u2261 0, which may happen only if\n2\nf \u2032\u2032 (0) = 0. So, if f \u2032\u2032 (0) 6= 0, there exists \u03c6 \u2208 XD\nsuch that DW (u)(\u03c0) * \u03c6 6= 0\nand the result now follows from the Implicit Function Theorem.\nSuppose now f \u2032\u2032 (0) = 0. Since 0 is an isolated root of f \u2032\u2032 and we must have\n\u2032\u2032\nf (u(t)) \u2261 0, it follows that u \u2261 0. But, in this case, denoting c = f \u2032 (0), we see\nthat v = v(u) solves\n\u2212v \u2032\u2032 + cv = 0,\n\nv(0) = 0,\n\nv \u2032 (0) = 1\n\nand v(u)(\u03c0) 6= 0 if and only if c 6= \u2212j 2 . Again, Ck is a manifold.\n\n\u2737\n\nLet us now consider the Ambrosetti-Prodi context f \u2032\u2032 > 0 or f \u2032\u2032 < 0. Let\np(t) \u2208 X be any strictly positive function in (0, \u03c0) and V be the space spanned\nby p(t). Decompose X = H \u2295 V in L2 \u2212orthogonal terms.\nTheorem C: If f \u2032\u2032 > 0 or f \u2032\u2032 < 0, then, for j \u2208 N\u2217 , Cj =\n6 \u2205 if and only if\n\u2212j 2 belongs to the interior of the image of f \u2032 . Also, if M\u03b8 6= \u2205 (in particular,\nCk = Mk\u03c0 6= \u2205), then the projection\n\u03a0 : X = H \u2295 V \u2192 H.\nis a diffeomorphism from M\u03b8 to H.\nProof. For each \u03bb \u2208 R and h \u2208 H fixed, we consider the straight line\nlh,p = h + \u03bbp \u2208 X. We will show that lh,p always intercepts each manifold M\u03b8\nonce and transversally. Uniqueness and transversality follows from\nZ \u03c0\n\u22121\nf \u2032\u2032 (u(r))p(r)[v(u)(r)]2 dr 6= 0.\nDW (u)(\u03c0) * p =\n{v(u)(\u03c0)}2 + {[v(u)]\u2032 (\u03c0)}2 0\nSmoothness (and local smooth invertibility, for a fixed \u03b8) in h, in turn, follows\nby setting u = h + \u03bbp in the formula above.\nSuppose that f \u2032\u2032 < 0: in this case, \u2212f \u2032 is increasing, \u2212f \u2032 (\u2212\u221e) = a and\n\u2032\n\u2212f (\u221e) = b. Here a, b \u2208 [\u2212\u221e, \u221e]. Clearly, the range (a, b) of \u2212f \u2032 is an\nopen set. From standard oscillation theory, the solutions of the three problems\nbelow (with initial position and velocity at 0 equal respectively to 0 and 1) have\nincreasing arguments,\nva\u2032\u2032 + ava = 0 v\u03bb\u2032\u2032 \u2212 f \u2032 (h + \u03bbp)v\u03bb = 0 vb\u2032\u2032 + bvb = 0.\nWe will see that the asymptotics of the argument at both ends of lh,p will be\ngiven by the argument of the solutions of the leftmost and rightmost problems.\n4\n\n\fFor a fixed value of the parameter \u03c9, let v\u03c9 be the solution of the problem\nv \u2032\u2032 + \u03c9v = 0,\n\nv(0) = 0, v \u2032 (0) = 1.\n\nWe denote\nW1 = W1 (\u03c9, t) = W (v\u03c9 )(t)\n\nand W2 = W2 (\u03bb, t) = W (h + \u03bbp)(t).\n\nIt follows immediately that\nlim W1 (\u03c9, \u03c0) = 0\n\n\u03c9\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nand\n\nlim W1 (\u03c9, \u03c0) = \u221e.\n\n\u03c9\u2192\u221e\n\nWe first study the behavior of W2 (\u03bb, t) when \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. Fix \u03c9 \u2208 R. It is easy\nto prove (see [5]) that the argument function satisfies the differential equation\n[W (u)(t)]\u2032 = cos2 W (u)(t) \u2212 f \u2032 (u(t))sin2 W (u)(t).\nThen\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n(W1 \u2212 W2 ) = [\u03c9 +f (h + \u03bbp)] sin W2 +\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\ncos2 W1 \u2212cos2 W2\n(W1 \u2212W2 ).\nW1 \u2212 W2\n\nThus U \u2032 + gU = H, for U := W1 \u2212 W2 , H =: [\u03c9 + f \u2032 (h + \u03bbp))] sin2 W2 and\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\ncos W1 \u2212 cos2 W2\n.\ng := \u2212\nW1 \u2212 W2\nSince g is continuousR and uniformly bounded in \u03bb, we can define the integrating\nt\nfactor G(t) = exp( 0 g(s)ds). Multiplication by this factor and integration\nproduces\nZ \u03c0\nexp(G(\u03c0))U (\u03c0) =\nexp(G(t))H(t)dt.\n(3)\n0\n\nIf b < \u221e, we choose \u03c9 = b and have H(t) > 0, yielding W1 (b) > W2 (\u03bb) for all\n\u03bb. The estimate\nZ \u03c0\n\u0001\nexp(G(t))H(t)dt \u2264 M k sin2 W2 kL2 kb \u2212 (\u2212f \u2032 (h + \u03bbp))kL2 ,\n0\n\nwhere M := maxt\u2208[0,\u03c0] exp(G(t)), shows that U (\u03c0) \u2192 0 when \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. This\nshows that W2 (\u03bb, \u03c0) converges increasingly to W1 (b, \u03c0), for \u03bb \u2192 \u221e, if b < \u221e. If\nb = \u221e, we have \u2212f \u2032 (h + \u03bbp) \u2212 \u03c9 > 0 in the interval (\u03b4, \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b4) if \u03bb is big enough.\nDefining r(t) := sin2 W2 exp(G(t)), we obtain\nZ \u03c0\u2212\u03b4\n[\u2212f \u2032 (h + \u03bbp) \u2212 \u03c9]r(t)dt < 0\nexp(G(\u03c0))(U (\u03c0)) \u2264 2M \u03b4\u03c9 \u2212\n\u03b4\n\nwhen \u03bb \u2192 \u221e. Consequently, the integral in (3) is negative, if \u03bb is sufficiently\nbig. We conclude that W2 (\u03bb, \u03c0) > W1 (\u03c9, \u03c0). Since lim\u03c9\u2192\u221e W1 (\u03c9, \u03c0) = \u221e, and\nwe again have that W2 (\u03bb, \u03c0) increases to W1 (b, \u03c0) = \u221e.\nIn a similar fashion, we obtain that W2 (\u03bb, \u03c0) converges decreasingly to\nW1 (a, \u03c0), when \u03bb \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Thus, the line lh,p intersects the same manifolds\nM\u03b8 irrespective of h: the values of \u03b8 for which lh, p trespasses M\u03b8 lie strictly\nbetween a and b. The case f \u2032\u2032 > 0 is similar.\n\u2737\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A. Ambrosetti and G. Prodi: On the inversion of some differentiable mappings with singularities between Banach spaces, Ann.
