Introduction\nLattice calculations of light-quark quantities such as quark masses, the kaon bag parameter,\nand semi-leptonic form-factors play a crucial role in extracting the fundamental parameters of the\nStandard Model and in constraining new physics beyond it. More complicated quantities such as\nnon-leptonic kaon decays are very sensitive to new physics, but are more difficult to calculate using\nlattice QCD. Nonetheless, great progress has been made on this front in just the last year.\nAlmost all of the more straightforward quantities mentioned above have been calculated by\na number of different groups, and there is excellent agreement between them when we restrict\nourselves to calculations for which a complete systematic error budget has been provided. Furthermore, for almost all of the quantities considered here there is more than one result with precision\ncomparable to the highest quoted precision for that quantity, so that this agreement is a nontrivial and important test of lattice methods. This is true of all the light quark masses, including the\nstrange quark mass, where it appears that the discrepancies of the past have now been largely\nresolved. (See, e.g. Ref. [1] for a compilation of older quark mass results.)\nIn this talk I cover light quark masses (u, d, and s), the K \u2192 \u03c0 l\u03bd form factor and the determination of |Vus |, the kaon bag parameter BK , kaon bag parameters relevant for beyond the\nStandard Model physics, and K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements. There are fully documented results from\nmore than one group for most of these; when this is the case world averages are presented. The\naverages presented here is work done in collaboration with Enrico Lunghi and Ruth Van de Water, where we update and extend to new quantities the averages presented in reference [2]. The\nlatest averages (including quantities outside the scope of this review) can be found on our website\nwww.latticeaverages.org. After reviewing the procedure we adopted for the averages presented in\nthis talk, I present status updates of the various quantities in turn, including the new averages.\nRelated reviews presented at this conference include a review of the light pseudoscalar decay\nconstants by Christian H\u00f6lbling [3], and a review of the impact on phenomenology of many of the\nabove quantities by Chris Sachrajda [4].\n\n2. Lattice averages\nOur main criteria for including a result in the world averages quoted here is that the calculation\ninclude a complete error budget, including all sources of systematic error, and also that the work be\ndocumented in either a publication or proceedings. Thus, we do not include numbers that appear\nonly in the slides of a conference talk. For the most part, we restrict ourselves to including only\nN f = 2 + 1 flavor lattice results in the averages because N f = 0 and 2 flavor calculations typically\ndo not quote an error due to quenching, as this is notoriously difficult to estimate reliably. Since we\nonly include results where estimates of all relevant systematic errors have been made, we exclude\nmost of the N f = 2 flavor results from the averages, though I show the most recent state-of-the-art\ntwo flavor calculations in the comparison plots. We make an exception in the averages for the\nN f = 2 calculation of the K \u2192 \u03c0 l\u03bd form factor at zero-recoil, f+ (0), since chiral perturbation\ntheory power counting can give a reasonable estimate for the size of the effect of quenching the\nstrange quark for this quantity, and this error was included as part of a complete systematic error\nbudget by the ETM Collaboration in ref [5].\n2\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nThere is an additional small systematic error in all of the N f = 2 + 1 flavor lattice results due to\nthe neglect of the dynamical charm quark from the simulations. This error is typically not included\nin current error budgets, though the effect is believed to be small. Because the charm quark is\nrelatively heavy compared to \u039bQCD , the size of the effects due to neglecting the charm quark in\nthe sea can be estimated using heavy-quark effective theory (HQET). The leading corrections are\nof order \u03b1s [\u039b/(2mc )], where the two is a combinatoric factor appearing generically in HQET.\nUsing reasonable estimates for these quantities (e.g., \u03b1s = 0.33, \u039b = 500 MeV, mc = 1.2 GeV)\nsuggests that the size of charm loop effects is around 1%, although this effect is likely to be further\nsuppressed in SU (3)-breaking ratios such as fK / f\u03c0 . Simulations with N f = 2 + 1 + 1 flavors are\nunderway by the ETM Collaboration [6] and the MILC Collaboration [7] to address this issue.\nNote that this HQET power counting estimate cannot be applied to the strange quark, and that the\neffects due to quenching the strange quark are more difficult to quantify without a direct comparison\nbetween N f = 2 and 2 + 1 flavor simulations. Such a direct comparison is possible, since the ETM\nCollaboration has now calculated many quantities using N f = 2 flavors with all systematic errors\nunder control except that due to quenching the strange quark. Good agreement is found with 2+1\nflavor calculations at the quoted level of precision, suggesting that the effect of quenching the\nstrange quark is small. Nonetheless, the precision on the 2 + 1 flavor averages is typically better\nthan that of the 2 flavor calculations and is of the size where one might expect dynamical strange\nquark effects to become visible. Thus, to be consistent with our criteria of including only results\nwith estimates of all the relevant systematic errors, we do not include N f = 2 flavor calculations\nin our averages, expect for the special case of f+ (0), as mentioned above and discussed further in\nSection V.\nIn order to avoid underestimating the errors in the averages, we need to take into account\ncorrelations between the different calculations. Although the full correlation matrices between\nthe different calculations do not exist and would be difficult to construct, we can still account for\ncorrelations using the following conservative assumptions: when calculations use the same gauge\nfield ensembles for the same quantity, we assume the statistical errors are 100% correlated. When\na systematic error is at all correlated between different calculations, we assume the correlation in\nthis error between calculations is 100%. This treatment of systematic correlations is conservative\nin that it will lead to somewhat of an overestimate of the total error in the average, but we feel it is\na reasonable assumption given the information available. Finally, we also adopt the Particle Data\nGroup (PDG) prescription for combining several measurements whose spread is wider than what\none would expect given the quoted errors. The error on such an average is rescaled by the square\nroot of the minimum of the \u03c7 2 / per degree of freedom [8].\nA snapshot of the simulation parameters is presented in Table 1 to give a sense of the range of\nlattice actions, lattice spacings, and light pion masses being used in the most recent results. For the\nstaggered simulations, I have quoted the root-mean-square pion mass for the minimum pion mass\nin the sea, while for the valence sector I have quoted the taste-goldstone pion mass as the minimum\npion mass. This gives a sense of how light the valence and sea pion masses are compared to other\nsimulations and is based on a more detailed look at staggered chiral perturbation theory formulas\n[17, 18, 59] for the quantities considered in this review that were computed using staggered quarks.\nFor simulations performed with domain wall valence quarks on a staggered sea, I again quote the\nroot-mean-square pion mass for the minimum pion mass in the sea, while for the valence sector\n3\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nTable 1: Snapshot of parameter values being used in numerical simulations reviewed in this talk.

This table reflects the\nparameters used in ongoing simulations, not necessarily the parameters appearing in the averages\nfor all quantities presented below.\n\n3. Quark masses\nThe quark masses are fundamental parameters of the Standard Model, but due to confinement\ndo not appear as free particles in nature. One must tune the lattice quark masses so that one\nreproduces the experimentally known hadron spectrum, with three experimental inputs needed to\ndetermine three quark masses (and a fourth experimental input to fix the scale). The bare lattice\nquark masses are then known in the regularization scheme defined by the lattice action of any\nparticular calculation, but to compare to results using other lattice actions or to be used as input\nin continuum calculations, must be converted to a standard continuum regularization scheme like\nMS. The matching factors needed to convert to the MS scheme are short distance parameters, and\ncan be computed perturbatively. Direct perturbative matching between a lattice scheme and the MS\nscheme is a technical challenge, especially at two-loop order or beyond. The convergence of lattice\nperturbation theory is typically poor unless tadpole-improvement and a renormalized coupling are\nused [20]. The convergence also tends to be better behaved when improved actions with fat gauge\nlinks are used [21], but this increases the difficulty of going to higher order, and few results beyond\none-loop are known. Non-pertubative matching to a regularization independent continuum scheme\ncan be performed [22], and then the matching to MS can be done in continuum perturbation theory,\nwhere it is easier to go to higher orders. It is also possible to renormalize the masses completely\nnon-perturbatively using the Schr\u00f6dinger functional scheme [23, 24].\nThe latest results for the strange quark mass and for the averaged up and down quark mass\nmud are shown in Figure 1. The notation in these and all subsequent average plots is as follows: for\nquantities that have been presented with full error budgets in a paper or proceedings, the data point\n4\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nMILC '09\nHPQCD '10\nRBC/KEK/Nagoya '10\nRBC/UKQCD '10\nBMW '10\nALV '09\nPACS-CS '10\nMILC '10\nETMC '10 (2 flavor)\n\nMILC '09\nHPQCD '10\nRBC/KEK/Nagoya '10\nRBC/UKQCD '10\nBMW '10\nALV '09\nMILC '10\nPACS-CS '10\nETMC '10 (2 flavor)\n\n80\n\n90\n\nms\n\n100\nMS(2 GeV)\n\n110\n\n120\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\nmud\n\n(MeV)\n\nMS(2 GeV)\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\n\n(MeV)\n\nFigure 1: Left panel: The strange quark mass mMS\ns (2GeV) from many groups, including the world average.\nSee the text for further details on color coding, etc. Right panel: The results for the average of the u and\nd quark masses mMS\nud (2GeV) from many groups with world average.

Quantities that are not included in the average\nare shown in red. This can be because the quantity has not yet been fully documented, or because\npotentially significant systematic errors have not yet been estimated. If the situation is the later, the\nquantity is distinguished by a dashed line in the error bar. A slight exception to this rule is that two\nflavor results are displayed without a dashed line, to emphasize that all errors except that due to\nquenching the strange quark have been included in the error estimate, but they are not included in\nthe averages in most cases as discussed above and are labeled explicitly.\nThe agreement between the different results for quark masses is striking, especially given\nthe long history of disagreement between various ms determinations. The only noticeable outlier\nin Figure 1 is the PACS-CS result [31], though this result does not yet include a full systematic\nerror budget by the admission of the authors, so that the significance of the difference cannot\nyet be assessed. The PACS-CS result uses a fully non-perturbative renormalization of Zm from\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger functional method, and values of the quark masses down to the physical masses.\nThese simulations still involve rather small volumes (m\u03c0 L \u223c 2) and there is so far only a single\nlattice spacing. The quoted systematic errors include statistical errors, a systematic error due to\nreweighting to the physical quark masses, and a complete systematic error for Zm . The error budget\ndoes not yet include errors due to discretization effects and finite volume effects, but calculations\nto address the remaining systematic errors are in progress [33].\nA few results in the quark mass determinations stand out due to their especially small errors.\nThe quark mass determinations of HPQCD use a novel method and have the smallest quoted errors [16]. The HPQCD Collaboration make use of their determination of the charm quark mass\nusing current-current correlators [26, 34], and the ratio of charm to strange quark masses [16] using a highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action [35] to simulate a relativistic charm quark\n5\n\n5.5\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nmc /ms\n\n14\n13\n12\n11\n0.000\n\n0.005\n\n0.010\n0.015\na2 (in fm2 )\n\n0.020\n\nFigure 2: Continuum extrapolation of ratio mc /ms from HPQCD [16].\n\nso that the charm and strange quark can be treated in the same formulation. The ratio mc /ms ,\nwhich receives no renormalization if both quarks are simulated in the same relativistic formalism,\nallows HPQCD to propagate their precise charm quark mass determination [26] (using the HISQ\nformalism and four-loop continuum perturbation theory [36]) down to the light quark masses. The\ncontinuum extrapolation of this quantity from HPQCD is shown in Fig. 2. The mc /ms ratio has also\nbeen calculated by the ETM Collaboration using two dynamical flavors [32], and it is in good agreement with the result of HPQCD. The BMW Collaboration uses smeared clover quarks down to the\nphysical light quark masses and the Rome-Southampton non-perturbative renormalization (NPR)\nmethod [22] and several lattice spacings down to \u223c 0.05 fm to control the perturbative matching [28]. The RBC/UKQCD Collaborations use domain wall quarks and the Rome-Southampton\nNPR method, but they match to a non-exceptional momentum scheme [11, 37], reducing the contamination from infrared effects and significantly reducing the size of the perturbative corrections\ncompared to schemes that involve exceptional momenta.\nAlthough the average of the u and d quark masses can be obtained in a fairly straightforward\nway from lattice simulations, the difference between the u and d quark masses requires an understanding of electromagnetic effects. These have been incorporated into lattice calculations using\ndifferent approaches. The MILC results for mu and md use the differences between the masses of\ncharged and neutral pions and kaons, along with continuum estimates of the violation of Dashen's\ntheorem to estimate the difference between the u and d quark masses [38]. HPQCD makes use of\nthe MILC values of the ratios between the u and d quark masses, thus using the same input for\nelectromagnetic contributions as MILC. RBC/KEK/Nagoya include (quenched) QED explicitly in\nthe lattice calculations, thus bypassing the need for continuum information on electromagnetic effects [27]. They make use of two volumes to study finite volume effects, and they use SU (2) heavy\nkaon chiral perturbation theory [39] to perform the chiral extrapolation, including electromagnetic\neffects. BMW obtain information on the electromagnetic corrections from dispersive studies of\n\u03b7 \u2192 3\u03c0 decays [14]. Again, the agreement is impressive, as can be seen in Figure 3, and the errors\non the world averages presented here for the u and d quark masses are at the 5% and 2% level,\nrespectively. Note that the u quark mass is over 20\u03c3 from zero, so that the vanishing of this mass\nappears to be ruled out as a solution to the strong CP problem [40, 41, 43, 42].\n6\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nMILC '09\nHPQCD '10\nRBC/KEK/Nagoya '10\nBMW '10\n\nMILC '09\nHPQCD '10\nRBC/KEK/Nagoya '10\nBMW '10\n1.5\n\n2\n\n3\n\n2.5\nMS(2 GeV)\n\nmu\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n4.5\n\n5\nMS(2 GeV)\n\nmd\n\n(MeV)\n\n6\n\n5.5\n\n(MeV)\n\nFigure 3: Left panel: The u quark mass mMS\nu (2GeV) from different groups, including the world average.\n(2GeV)\nfrom different groups with world average.

As noted above, these ratios are\ninteresting to examine because the renormalization factor needed to quote the quark masses in a\ncommon scheme cancels. For ms /mud there is, once again, impressive agreement between the various determinations, in particular those of MILC [25], HPQCD [16], and BMW [28], where the\ntotal errors from each group are at the sub-percent level. This precision agreement is noteworthy in\npart because it is not possible to get much guidance from experiment on the value of this ratio, unlike say the light hadron spectrum or pion and kaon decay constants, and no other non-perturbative\nmethods quote errors that are competitive with the precision of the lattice results. Leading order\nchiral perturbation theory (\u03c7 PT) predicts a value around 26.0 [44], but it is difficult to improve this\nresult systematically to the same precision using \u03c7 PT because of uncertainties in the low energy\nconstants appearing at higher order in the chiral expansion.\n\n4.

The non-perturbative information is encoded in the form\nfactor f+ (0), and once this is known from lattice QCD, a value for Vus can be determined. The\nvalue of f+ (0) is already rather well constrained by SU (3) chiral perturbation theory, an expansion\nin powers of m2K /(8\u03c0 2 f\u03c02 ) [46]. One can write f+ (0) = 1+ f2 + f4 + ..., where the first term is equal\nto one due to current conservation in the SU (3) limit. The correction f2 does not contain any new\nunknown low energy constants, as required by the Ademollo-Gatto theorem [47], and is predicted\nin terms of pion and kaon masses and the pion decay constant to be f2 = \u22120.0226. We need to\nknow f4 , if we are to do better, but this requires the determination of new higher order unknown\nlow energy constants. The value for f4 was estimated by Leutwyler and Roos in 1984 [48] using a\nquark model; they obtained f4 = \u22120.016(8), which gives f+ (0) = 0.961(8).\nThere are only two lattice calculations of f+ (0) that have complete systematic error budgets,\n8\n\n0.8\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\none from ETMC from 2009 [5] and a more recent update in 2010 [49] of an older calculation from\nRBC/UKQCD [50], with the average shown in Figure 5. As mentioned in Section 2, we include the\nETMC result in our world average even though it is with N f = 2 flavors because there is a credible\nestimate of the systematic error due to quenching the strange quark. The ETMC result has already\nbeen reviewed by Vittorio Lubicz [53] in his lattice review talk from last year, but it is worth\nrecalling the treatment of the error due to quenching the strange quark for f+ (0). In the chiral\neffective theory the N f dependence can be incorporated; this modifies the chiral logarithms and\nchanges the low energy constants from their N f = 3 to N f = 2 values. Although it is straightforward\nto use the known chiral logarithm expressions to adjust for unphysical quenching effects, the N f\ndependence of the low energy constants is not known. For f+ (0) the effect of using N f = 2 sea\nquarks can be corrected for in the f2 term exactly, since there are no new low energy constants\nappearing to this order, and the strange sea quark dependence is a known expression involving\nchiral logarithms. The f4 term requires the knowledge of new low energy constants, and these\nwill take their N f = 2 values in the ETMC calculation. The remaining error in f+ (0) due to the\ndifference between f4 in the N f = 2 and 3 flavor theories is estimated by looking at the difference\nbetween f4 in the N f = 2 and N f = 0 calculations. The full difference between f4 in the 2 flavor\ntheory and the 0 flavor (completely quenched) theory is taken as the error due to quenching the\nstrange quark for this quantity [5].\nThe RBC/UKQCD result for f+ (0) [49] is an update of their previous result [50] from 2007.\nThis new calculation improves upon the previous one by using twisted boundary conditions [51, 52]\nto remove the need to interpolate in q2 to get the form factor at zero-recoil. They also apply a\ndifferent choice of chiral extrapolation, where analytic next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) terms\nthat do not obey the Ademollo-Gatto theorem are included. Such terms are possible if f\u03c0 is used\nin the NLO expression instead of f0 , the decay constant in the SU (3) limit. This is because when\nreordering the series to use f\u03c0 in the NLO expression, analytic terms that do not respect the mass\ninterchange symmetry can appear at NNLO. RBC/UKQCD quote f+ (0) = 0.9599(34)(+31\n\u221243 )(14),\nwhere the first error is statistical, the second is due to the chiral extrapolation, and the third is an\nestimate of discretization errors [49].\nThere were progress updates for f+ (0) from the FNAL/MILC Collaborations using staggered\nquarks [54] and from the JLQCD Collaboration using overlap quarks [55]. The FNAL/MILC\ncalculation is using the method developed by HPQCD for D \u2192 Kl\u03bd [56] to get a result for f+ (0)\nusing\nf+ (0) = f0 (0) =\n\nms \u2212 mq\nh\u03c0 |S|Kiq2 =0\nm2K \u2212 m\u03c02\n\n(4.3)\n\nso that no renormalization is required. This avoids the use of non-local vector currents and does not\nrequire multiple three-point correlators to form various double ratios. Twisted boundary conditions\nare used to calculate f0 at the q2 = 0 point. The disadvantage of this method is that one cannot\nobtain f0 (q2 ) for q2 6= 0, but this is still sufficient to determine |Vus |, since the shape dependence of\nthe form factor is usually taken from experiment.\nThe JLQCD calculation was done at a single lattice spacing and a somewhat small (1.7 fm)\nvolume. The q2 dependence was modeled using various functional forms to interpolate to q2 =\n9\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\n0.6\n0.59\n\nAnalytic ansatz\n\n0.59\n0.58\n0.57\n\nBK (MS, 2 GeV)\n\nBK(MS, 2GeV)\n\n0.58\n\n0.57\n\n0.56\n3\n\n32 data (analytic)\n3\n\n0.55\n\n24 data (analytic)\n3\n\n32 data (ChPT)\n\n0.56\n0.55\n0.54\n0.53\n0.52\n\nNPR sys err.\n\n0.51\n\n3\n\n24 data (ChPT)\nLO analytic\nNLO SU(2) ChPT\n\n0.54\n\n0.53\n\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.02\n\n0.5\n0.49\n0.48\n\n0.025\n\nml (GeV)\n\nRI/MOM\n\n(\u03b3\u03bc,q/)\n\n(\u03b3\u03bc,\u03b3\u03bc)\n\n(q/,q/)\n\n(q/,\u03b3\u03bc)\n\nScheme\n\nFigure 6: Left panel: Extrapolation in light quark mass for BK from RBC/UKQCD [58].

Kaon mixing\nThe constraint on the unitarity triangle coming from kaon mixing can be expressed as\n|\u03b5K | = C\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b5 BK A2 \u03b7 {\u2212\u03b71 S0 (xc )(1 \u2212 \u03bb 2 /2) + \u03b73 S0 (xc , xt ) + \u03b72 S0 (xt )A2 \u03bb 2 (1 \u2212 \u03c1 )},\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere C\u03b5 is a collection of experimentally determined parameters, \u03ba\u03b5 represents long-distance\ncontributions and a correction due to the fact that the quantity \u03c6\u03b5 6= 45 degrees [57], BK is the kaon\nbag parameter, the \u03b7i S0 are perturbative coefficients, and \u03bb , A, \u03c1 , \u03b7 are CKM matrix elements in\nWolfenstein parameterization. The experimental determination of |\u03b5K | leads to a constraint on the\nunitarity triangle in the shape of a hyperbolic band in the \u03c1 -\u03b7 plane. The main non-perturbative\ninput needed from the lattice to implement this constraint on the CKM unitarity triangle is the kaon\nbag parameter BK .\nThere have been three recent updates on this quantity: from the RBC/UKQCD Collaborations\n[58], from the SBW Collaboration [59], and from ETMC [60]. The RBC/UKQCD Collaborations\nhave updated their eariler result [61] using domain-wall quarks with a number of improvements,\nincluding a second lattice spacing to allow a continuum limit to be taken, and the use of various nonperturbative renormalization schemes with non-exceptional momentum to perform the matching to\nthe continuum [62]. The RBC/UKQCD results have also modified their approach to the chiral\nextrapolation. For their central value, they average the result using SU (2) heavy-kaon \u03c7 PT to\nperform the extrapolation in light quark mass and the result using a simple linear extrapolation.\nThis approach was motivated by the absence of detectable curvature in their data, and the tendency\nof their SU (2) fit to undershoot f\u03c0 . Figure 6 shows the light-quark mass extrapolation for BK for\n10\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nboth the linear and the SU (2) fits. RBC/UKQCD used multiple RI-SMOM schemes with nonexceptional momenta to determine the matching factor for BK . Figure 6 shows the comparison of\nresults between the various RI-SMOM schemes, as well as results from the RI/MOM scheme. The\nsystematic error associated with the NPR matching is also shown in Fig 6. The final result quoted\nfor B\u0302K is 0.749(7)(21)(3)(15), where the errors are statistical, chiral extrapolation, finite volume,\nand renormalization [58].\nThe SBW Collaboration has adopted a mixed-action approach, using HYP-smeared staggered\nquarks [63] on the MILC asqtad ensembles, with four lattice spacings down to 0.045 fm [59, 64].\nThe matching is done to one-loop order in lattice perturbation theory [65]. The chiral and continuum extrapolation is done using SU (2) staggered chiral perturbation theory [66]. The SU (2) formulation has much simpler expressions than the SU (3) case, where many new parameters specific\nto the staggered formalism enter [18]. SBW quote as their main result a value B\u0302K = 0.724(12)(43),\nwhere the errors are statistical and the sum of systematic errors in quadrature [59]. The dominant error is currently due to the one-loop perturbative matching. Non-perturbative matching is in\nprogress.\nThe ETM Collaboration has a result for BK using a mixed action [67] with three lattice spacings down to 0.07 fm [60]. The valence action is Osterwalder-Seiler [68] and the sea sector is that\nof the ETMC N f = 2 twisted mass ensembles [9]. They quote a value of B\u0302K = 0.733(29)(16),\nwhere the first error contains statistical, chiral extrapolation/fit, and matching errors, while the second contains an error due to different assumptions of O(a2 p2 ) dependence in the RI-MOM scheme\nmatching factor [60]. A calculation by ETMC using 2+1+1 flavors is in progress.\nThe world average for B\u0302K is shown in Fig. 7. All of the results are in good agreement, which\nis impressive given the different discretizations and methods employed in the various calculations.\nThe effect of quenching the strange quark appears to be rather small, as we can see by comparing\nthe ETMC result with that of the 2+1 flavor average.\nThe ETM Collaboration has presented the first preliminary unquenched (two-flavor) results\nfor four-quark operators that contribute to kaon mixing in the presence of new physics [71]. The\neffective Hamiltonian relevant for beyond the Standard Model physics contains several new fourquark operators, in addition to the one associated with BK . Only four new matrix elements are\nrequired, however, since for the new operators only the parity-even parts are needed because the\nstrong interaction conserves parity.\nThe bag parameters associated with the new operators are defined by [71]\n8\n0\nhK |O1 (\u03bc )|K 0 i = BK (\u03bc ) m2K fK2 ,\n3\nm2K fK\nhK |Oi (\u03bc )|K i = Ci Bi (\u03bc )\nms ( \u03bc ) + md ( \u03bc )\n0\n\n\u0014\n\n0\n\n(5.2)\n\u00152\n\n,\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere Ci = {\u22125/3, 1/3, 2, 2/3}, i = 2, ..., 5, when we take the basis of operators used in Ref. [71].\nThe matrix element of O1 is just the Standard Model contribution to kaon mixing. Note that the\nother operators do not vanish in the chiral limit.\nThe ETMC calculation includes three lattice spacings, fairly light pion masses (down to \u223c 280\nMeV) and non-perturbative renormalization using the RI-MOM scheme. They find that the chiral\n11\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nHPQCD/UKQCD '06\nALV '09\nSBW '10\nRBC/UKQCD '10\nETM '10 (2 flavor)\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.65\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.85\n\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n^\nB\nK\nFigure 7: Results for B\u0302K including the world average.

K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\nLattice calculations of non-leptonic K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 decays are challenging because of the two-hadron\nfinal state, but they are important for phenomenology. Lattice calculations of K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix\nelements have the potential to give us a first principles determination of the decades old \u2206I =\n1/2 rule, and would finally allow us to use the experimental measurement of \u03b5 \u2032 /\u03b5 as a precision\nconstraint on the Standard Model [72].

The smallness of the parameter \u03c9 = Re(A2 )/Re(A0 ) \u2248 0.05 is a manifestation of the\n\u2206I = 1/2 rule.\n12\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nK \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements are difficult to calculate on the lattice because the Maiani-Testa nogo theorem [73] tells us that we cannot extract physical matrix elements from Euclidean correlation\nfunctions with multi-hadronic final states. Due to the restriction of working in Euclidean time, the\nmost straightforward lattice implementation of calculating K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements only works\nif the final state pions are at rest, or at some other set of unphysical kinematics. Two general\nstrategies have emerged for getting around this problem. One strategy is to construct K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\nmatrix elements indirectly using the low energy constants (LEC's) of chiral perturbation theory as\ndetermined from simpler lattice matrix elements such as K \u2192 0 and K \u2192 \u03c0 [74]. It was shown in\nRefs. [75, 76, 77, 78] that all LEC's through next-to-leading order could be obtained from relatively\nsimple lattice quantities. However, this method has the disadvantage that the convergence of SU (3)\nchiral perturbation theory at the physical kaon mass is slow, and it is not clear whether K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0\nmatrix elements can be computed in this way to a useful precision [79, 80].\nA method for calculating K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements directly at physical kinematics was introduced by Lellouch and L\u00fcscher [81]. The Lellouch-L\u00fcscher method exploits the finite lattice\nvolume to obtain the matrix elements directly by tuning the volume so that the first excited state\nof the two pion state matches the kaon mass. The direct method is straightforward to implement,\nthough it is computationally demanding because it requires large lattice volumes (\u223c 6 fm) and physical light quark masses. Improvements to the method have been introduced so that the non-zero\nmomentum pion state becomes the ground state and smaller volumes can be used [82, 83, 84, 85].\nThe RBC/UKQCD Collaborations have made significant progress using the direct method, with\npreliminary results at nearly the physical quark masses and physical kinematics for the \u2206I = 3/2\ndecay channel [86]; this is discussed below.\nA technique for improving upon the indirect method was presented by the author and Van de\nWater, where we exploited the fact that one can simulate K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements with the pions\nproduced at rest [80]. If one takes the pion mass to be 1/2mK , this amplitude can be computed\ndirectly, since it is not forbidden by the Maiani-Testa theorem, a fact known for quite some time\nphys\nphys\n[87]. Thus, we tune the light quark masses such that mK = mK and m\u03c0 = mK /2. One can then\ncorrect for the unphysical kinematics using fixed order SU (3) \u03c7 PT, where the low energy constants\ncan be obtained from simpler quantities, like K \u2192 \u03c0 . Because the kaon is tuned to its physical\nvalue, the terms involving kaons (etas) are correct (nearly correct) to all orders in the SU (3) chiral\nexpansion. Thus the 10-30% precision of NLO SU (3) \u03c7 PT now appears in a small correction\nfactor, rather than the entire amplitude. This can be tested for known quantities like fK and f\u03c0 ,\nresults of which are shown in Fig. 8. These plots illustrate the fact that the NLO corrections to\nf\u03c0 are below 10% for this method, and the corrections to fK are below 5%. Also, the one-loop\ncorrections account for most of the difference between the 2m\u03c0 = mK values and the accepted\nvalues.\nThe value for Re(A2 ) at physical kinematics from JL and Van de Water is calculated similarly,\nwhere the value at the 2m\u03c0 = mK point is corrected using the leading order \u03c7 PT expression,\nh\u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 |O(27,1),(3/2) |K 0 iLO =\n\n4iB0 f0 2\n(mK \u2212 m\u03c02 ),\n3\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere f0 and B0 are the pion decay constant and BK in the SU (3) chiral limits, respectively.

This corresponds to a spatial box size of around 4.5 fm. The lightest unitary\npion mass is 180 MeV, and a lighter valence pion with mass around 140 MeV is used for the central value. The main errors contributing to the RBC/UKQCD calculation of Re(A2 ) are given in\nTable 4. The largest error is the estimate of scaling violations due to the use of somewhat coarse\nlattices at a single lattice spacing and the fact that K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements scale as the lattice\nspacing cubed. The RBC/UKQCD result for Im(A2 ) is expected to have a similar error once the\nnonperturbative renormalization is completed.\nThe calculation of the \u2206I = 1/2 rule is more difficult for a number of reasons. One is the\npresence of power divergent contributions arising from mixing with lower dimensional operators.\nThis problem has been addressed by the use of chiral fermions, where the operator subtraction\nis straightforward [89, 90]. Another problem is the presence of enhanced finite-volume effects\nthat afflict the calculation when the light valence quark masses are not the same as in the sea\n[91, 92]. This was an especially serious problem for quenched attempts to calculate \u2206I = 1/2 kaon\nmatrix elements [93], but is under control when sea quarks of the correct mass are included in the\n15\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\nd\ns\nK0\n\n\u03c0+\n\nK0\ns\n\nd\n\nu\nu\n\nd\n\n\u03c0+\nu\n\n\u03c0\u2212\nd\n\nt0\n\nt0 + Nt\n\nt0\n\nt0 + Nt\n\n(a)\nK0\n\ns\n\n(b)\nd\n\nK0\ns\n\n\u03c0+\n\n\u03c0\u2212\nt0\n\nd\n\nt0 + Nt\n\n\u03c0+\n\nd\nu\n\nq\n\nu\n\nq\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\nd\n\n\u03c0\u2212\n\nd\nt0\n\nt0 + Nt\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 10: Quark flow diagrams for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 in the \u2206I = 1/2 channel.\n\ncalculation. Another difficulty is the appearance of disconnected quark flow diagrams, leading to\nthe need for very high statistics. The contractions at the level of quark flow are shown in Fig. 10 for\nthe \u2206I = 1/2 channel. The red circle is the insertion of the four-quark operator. Additional diagrams\nwith a quark current insertion are not shown, but are needed to perform the power divergent operator\nsubtraction. Figure 10(d) shows the disconnected diagram that is problematic due to the need\nfor high statistics. This problem will likely be solved by more computing and better inversion\nalgorithms.\nResults for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 correlation functions in the \u2206I = 1/2 channel from RBC/UKQCD were\npresented by Qi Liu [94], and they are shown in Fig. 11. These correlators were obtained from 2+1\nflavor domain wall ensembles with Iwasaki gauge action generated by RBC/UKQCD with volume\n163 \u00d7 32 and Ls = 16, with pion masses around 420 MeV. Propagator inversions were performed on\neach time slice for 400 configurations. The operator Q2 gives the dominant contribution to Re(A0 )\nat renormalization scales typical of lattice calculations, while Q6 gives the dominant contribution to\nIm(A0 ). The blue (open) circles show the contribution to the correlator from the diagrams (a), (b),\nand (c) in Fig. 10, while the red (filled) circles include all four diagrams, including the disconnected\ndiagram Fig. 10(d). The comparison between open and closed circles in Fig. 11 shows the large\nstatistical errors introduced by the disconnected diagram. Table 5 also illustrates this point with\nentries for Re(A0 ) and Im(A0 ) with and without the disconnected diagram. The error on Re(A0 )\nis about 25%, while the error on Im(A0 ) indicates that more statistics are needed to be sure of\na signal. It was reported at the conference by Liu that for non-zero momentum the \u2206I = 1/2\ncorrelators barely had a signal, even without the disconnected diagrams. Again, improvements are\nexpected by going to larger lattices, as well as bigger machines and better inversion algorithms.\nFinally, I observe that the indirect method for K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 discussed above is not likely to match\nthe precision possible with the direct method in the \u2206I = 3/2 channel, but could be useful for the\n\u2206I = 1/2 channel, given the significant amount of computing needed to reach non-zero momentum\nat the physical kinematics in this channel.\n16\n\n\fLight quark physics\n\nJack Laiho\n\n2e+09\n\n2e+10\n\nQ'2\nQ2\n\n1.5e+09\n\nQ'6\nQ6\n\n1.5e+10\n\n1e+09\n\n1e+10\n\n5e+08\n\n5e+09\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-5e+08\n\n-5e+09\n\n-1e+09\n\n-1e+10\n\n-1.5e+09\n\n-1.5e+10\n\n-2e+09\n\n-2e+10\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFigure 11: Left panel: K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements at zero momentum for Q2 with and without disconnected\ndiagrams from RBC/UKQCD [94].

Errors are statistical only.\n\n7. Summary and Outlook\nResults for the simplest quantities in light quark physics are now in impressive agreement.\nTo take one example, many groups now have results for quark masses using dynamical ensembles, multiple lattice spacings, and improved techniques for computing the renormalization factor,\nand there is agreement at the few percent level, with systematic errors under control. This is an\nimportant achievement for the lattice. Other quantities that are important for flavor physics show\nsimilarly impressive agreement, and it has become clear that averages are necessary to maximize\nthe impact of these lattice results on constraining new physics. I have reviewed the approach to\naveraging that my collaborators E. Lunghi and R. Van de Water and I have adopted [2], and I have\npresented our updated averages for many quantities involving light quarks. More difficult quantities like K \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 matrix elements in the \u2206I = 3/2 channel are now within reach, and preliminary\nresults with errors at the 10 \u2212 20% have been presented [86, 80]. The \u2206I = 1/2 channel is more\ndifficult but may be attainable in the next few years.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI wish to thank the organizers of \"Lattice 2010\" for an excellent conference.
