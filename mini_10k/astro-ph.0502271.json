Koo6\n1 Smith College, Northampton, MA, USA 01060 2 Amherst College 3 University of Wisconsin\n4 Universidad Complutense de Madrid 5 University of Florida 6 UCO/Lick Observatory\n\nAbstract\n\n1.\n\nTo make direct comparisons in the rest-far-ultraviolet between LBGs at z \u223c 3\nand more local star-forming galaxies, we use HST/STIS to image a set of 12\nnearby (z < 0.05) H II galaxies in the FUV and a set of 14 luminous compact\nblue galaxies (LCBGs) at moderate redshift (z \u223c 0.5) in the NUV, corresponding to the rest-FUV. We then subject both sets of galaxy images and those of\nLBGs at z \u223c 3 to the same morphological and structural analysis. We find many\nqualitative and quantitative similarities between the rest-FUV characteristics of\ndistant LBGs and of the more nearby starburst samples, including general morphologies, sizes, asymmetries, and concentrations. Along with some kinematic\nsimilarities, this implies that nearby H II galaxies and LCBGs may be reasonable local analogs of distant Lyman break galaxies.\n\nLyman break galaxies\n\nLyman break galaxies (LBGs) at redshifts z \u223c 3 are the current gold standard for star-forming galaxies in the early universe, at least rest-UV and optically selected ones. Many of their properties are revealed by deep multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys (e.g., presentations at this conference by Bremmer, Erb, Huang, Mehlert, Papovich, Sawicki, and others).\nThese include small sizes r1/2 < 4 kpc, high luminosities L \u223c L\u2217, significant\nclustering, and diverse morphologies. LBGs are also copiously star-forming,\neasily qualifying as starbursts according to the star formation intensity (SFR\nper unit mass or gas mass) definition advocated by Tim Heckman at this conference (e.g., Meurer et al. 1997).\nSignificant questions remaining about the nature of LBGs include their masses,\ntheir mass assembly histories, their fate, and their environments, including any\ndark matter. Comparison to local galaxies with similar properties may help\n\n\f2\nilluminate some or all of those issues, since nearby systems can generally be\nstudied in much greater detail.\n\n2.\n\nCompact starbursts at z < 1 in the Rest-UV\n\nWe face two problems in attempting to draw parallels between distant LBGs\nand nearby starbursts: (1) LBGs are best seen in the optical, corresponding at\nz = 3 to the rest-UV; and (2) it is not obvious which kind or kinds of local\nsystems are the best proxies.\nTwo classes of galaxy at z < 1 seem especially promising as nearby cousins\nof LBGs: H IIgalaxies at z \u223c 0 and luminous compact blue galaxies (LCBGs)\nat 0.4 < z < 1. Both classes show, in the optical, the small sizes, high luminosities, diverse morphologies, and copious star formation that also characterize LBGs. To push the comparison further, we have obtained rest-UV images\nwith the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph onboard Hubble Space Telescope (HST/STIS) of 12 H II galaxies and 14 LCBGs. The samples are drawn\nfrom the UCM survey (Perez-Gonzalez et al. 2001) and the Kitt Peak Galaxy\nRedshift Survey (Munn 1997), respectively. Many have also been imaged with\nHST/WFPC2 and/or NICMOS and/or studied spectroscopically at Keck and\nArecibo (e.g. Pisano et al. 2001).\n\n3.\n\nRest-UV Morphologies\n\nThe HST/STIS UV images of the 26 low- and intermediate-redshift starburst\ngalaxies in our sample are shown in Fig. 1. It is immediately obvious that the\nrest-UV morphologies represent a diverse panoply, rather than a uniform class.\nMultiple knots, tails, and extended emission \u2013 almost all invisible at groundbased resolution in the optical \u2013 are the rule rather than the exception.\nWe attempted to quantify the UV morphologies of our nearby and intermediate compact starbursts using the CAS (compactness, asymmetry, and clumpiness) methodology of Conselice et al. (2003). The measured asymmetry is\nvery sensitive to the exact radius at which it is measured; we tried both halflight radii and Petrosian radii. Fig. 2 shows the distribution of asymmetries\nA(rP ). We find that the mean A(rP ) of our two samples is roughly consistent\nwith that of LBGs measured in the HDF by Conselice et al. (2003), although\nthe formal measurement uncertainties are very large.\n\n4.\n\nSimulating LBGs at z = 3\n\nWhat would the H II galaxies and LCBGs look like if placed at redshift z =\n3? We simulated that view by resampling our HST/STIS images and adding\nnoise to reproduce the Hubble Deep Field sensitivity. The H II galaxies are too\nfaint to detect, but the LCBGs, which are more luminous, are all easily detected\n\n\fAre there local analogs of Lyman break galaxies?\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Left: Mosaic of HST/STIS-FUV images (\u03bbc = 1590A) of 12 H II galaxies from\nthe UCM survey. Redshifts are labelled for each galaxy. Each image is 6\u2032\u2032.5 on a side, corrsponding to 2.5 kpc at z = 0.02. Right: Mosaic of HST/STIS-NUV images (\u03bbc = 2320A) of 9 of\nthe 14 LCBGs. Each image is 3\u2032\u2032.75 on a side, corresponding to 22.5 kpc at z = 0.5. Note the\nsmall sizes and disturbed, varied rest-UV morphologies of both samples, reminiscent of LBGs\nat higher redshift.\n\nFigure 2. Distribution of asymmetries measured at Petrosian radius for both the H II galaxy\n(FUV) and LCBG (NUV) samples. The mean is roughly consistent with that of LBGs measured\nin the HDF by Conselice et al. (2003).\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 3. LCBGs shown at their true redshift (left panel of each pair) and simulated view as\nthey would appear at redshift z = 3 observed in the HDF. All sources would be easily detected\nat z = 3, although faint, low-surface brightness emission is lost to noise.\n\n(Fig. 3). Despite the loss of low-surface brightness features, the similarities to\nthe appearances of real LBGs are striking.\nWe conclude that H II galaxy and LCBG morphologies, like their sizes,\ncolors, and star-formation rates and intensities, are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to those of LBGs. They are therefore reasonable local testbeds\nfor further comparative study of LBGs, including constraints on mass.\nOur future plans include applying other morphological measures such as the\nGini coefficient (Lotz et al. 2004) and combining these STIS UV images with\nWFPC2 and NICMOS images in hand to constrain stellar populations, dust\ncontent, and merger scenarios.\n\nReferences\nConselice, C.J., Bershady, M.A., Dickinson, M. & Papovich, C. 2003, ApJ, 136, 1183\nKoo, D.C., Guzman, R.
