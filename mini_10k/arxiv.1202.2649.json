They are predicted to\nemerge as excitations in several solid-state systems, such as\ngenuine two-dimensional (2D) p-wave superconductors [5],\nor induced via superconducting proximity effects in topological insulators [4, 6, 7] or one-dimensional (1D) wires [8\u2013\n12] as boundary zero modes. They obey non-Abelian statistics, both in 2D [13] and 1D [14], allowing for implementation of certain (nonuniversal) gate operations required in\nquantum-computational schemes via braiding of the Majorana\nfermions. Moreover, due to their highly nonlocal character,\nthe qubits built out of Majorana fermions are insensitive to\nlocal parity-conserving perturbations, thus making them potentially robust against physical noise errors [2, 15, 16].\nThe existence of Majorana states, however, has been shown\nnot only for static systems, but also for driven systems, as\nzero modes in the so-called Floquet Hamiltonians [17\u201319], or\neven, more recently, in dissipative systems [20]. These proposals are based on the idea that driven systems can have\ndifferent topology from their static parents, albeit these are\nnot actual ground states. The ground-state perspective can,\nhowever, be used even for the driven models, if instead of a\nclassical driving one considers the driving as having its own\nquantum dynamics, such as in a high-Q electromagnetic cavity. In particular, 1D microwave cavities have been proven extremely successful in reaching the so-called strong-coupling\nregime between photons and different types of qubits [21\u201329],\nwith very large Q factors and a high degree of control. Moreover, strong coupling between atomic gases (e.g., in a BoseEinstein condensate) and optical cavities have been achieved\nwith a high degree of coherence [30]. In this paper, we combine cavity QED with Majorana physics in a 1D lattice model.\nWe analyze the spectrum of a p-wave lattice superconductor\n(Kitaev chain) coupled to a microwave cavity and examine the\ntopology of the combined system. The spectrum is studied using Dicke-like Hamiltonian, in both the off- and on-resonant\nregimes.\nThe model.-In Fig. 1, we show a schematic of the system under consideration: a Kitaev chain inserted in a 1D microwave cavity.

The hopping parameter t and the chemical potential \u03bc\ncan be modified by the (quantum) cavity electric field \u00ca(x),\nengendering a physical coupling between electrons and photons. The associated wavelength is assumed to be much larger\nthan the 1D chain, so that the electric field has no spatial dependence along the latter.\nThe total Hamiltonian of the system, H = H1D + Hint + Hph ,\nconsists of\nH1D = \u2212\n\nN\u22121 \u0010\nX\n\nN\nX\n\u0011\ntc\u2020j+1 c j + \u2206c\u2020j+1 c\u2020j + H.c. \u2212 \u03bc\nc\u2020j c j ,\n\nj=1\n\nHint\n\nj=1\n\n\uf8eb N\n\uf8f6\nN\nX\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec X\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u0010\n\u0011\n\u2020\n\u2020 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed\u03b2\nc j+1 c j + H.c. + \u03b1\nc j c j \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 a\u2020 + a ,\nj=1\n\n(1)\n\nj=1\n\nand Hph = \u03c9 a\u2020 a, where t is the hopping parameter, \u2206 is the\np-wave pairing potential, \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03b1 is the\nelectron-photon coupling that shifts the chemical potential,\nand \u03b2 accounts for changes in the tunneling Hamiltonian in\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b32j = i(c j \u2212 c\u2020j ), in terms of Majorana operators, (\u03b3ij )\u2020 = \u03b3ij ,\nwith i = 1, 2, we can write the 1D wire Hamiltonian simP\n1\n2\n2 1\nply as H1D = \u2212it N\u22121\nj=1 \u03b3 j \u03b3 j+1 , with \u03b31 and \u03b3N dropping out\nentirely.

Using periodic boundary\nconditions allows us to\u221a switch to the reciprocal space using\nP\nP\nc j = k ck exp (\u2212ik j)/ N to write H1D = k HBdG (k), where\nHBdG (k) = \u2212 (t cos k + \u03bc) \u03c4zk \u2212 t sin k \u03c4kx\n\n(2)\n\nis the Bogoliubov-De Gennes Hamiltonian (restoring a finite \u03bc), and the pseudospin \u03c4k = (\u03c4kx , \u03c4yk , \u03c4zk ), expressed\nin terms of the Pauli matrices, acts on the particle-hole\nbasis (ck , c\u2020\u2212k ).\nOne can diagonalize this Hamiltonian\n\u2020\ne\nHBdG (k) = U (k)HBdG (k)U(k) by U(k) = exp (i\u03b8k \u03c4kx ), which\np\neBdG = \u000fk \u03c4z , with \u000fk =\ngives H\nt2 + \u03bc2 + 2t\u03bc cos k and\nk\n\u03b8k = arctan [t sin k/(t cos k + \u03bc)]/2.

While the hopping change in electric field appears naturally, the modification of the chemical\npotential is unambiguous only in the presence of a superconducting reservoir and is associated with supercurrents flowing\nfrom and into the nanowire on a time scale determined by the\nstrength of the associated Josephson coupling. We are thus\ntacitly assuming that such Josephson oscillations are much\nfaster than the relevant dynamics in the cavity, so that the effective pairing \u2206 is essentially anchored at a constant value.\nFor simplicity, we also assume that \u2206 is unaffected by the\nphoton field. a (a\u2020 ) stands for the photon creation (annihilation) operator and \u03c9 is the frequency of the corresponding\nphoton mode (setting ~ = 1 throughout). The electric field inside the cavity\np (correspondng to its fundamental harmonic) is\n\u00ca(x) = \u00eay \u03c9/Ld2 c sin (\u03c0z/L)(a\u2020 + a) [23], with L being the\ncavity length, d is the distance between the center conductor\nand the ground conductors (see Fig. 1), and c is the capacitance per unit length. Note that the maximum of the electric\nfield is at z = L/2, where we suppose to position the wire.\nIsolated wire.-We begin by recapping some of the known\nresults on the Majorana physics in 1D p-wave superconductors. To keep the ideas transparent (but without loss of generality), we assume in this section real t = \u2206 > 0 and\n\u03bc = 0.

The dimensionless functions \u0393(x) (inset) and \u03932 (x) as a function of x \u2261 |\u03bc|/t. There is a strong signature of the transition point\nx = 1 (i.e., |\u03bc| = t) in \u03932 , which becomes singular.\n\nCavity-coupled wire.-The combined system Hamiltonian\ncan be mapped to the well-known Dicke model, namely a set\nof spins interacting with the same photonic mode. We start\nwith the bulk system, later focusing on a finite wire. In the\ncontinuum limit, we can write the interaction Hamiltonian as\nP\nHint = \u03b1 k \u03b4k (a\u2020 + a)\u03c4zk , with \u03b4k = 1 + (\u03b2/\u03b1) cos k, which resembles the interaction Hamiltonian between a photonic mode\nand a collection of spins: the Dicke model. To analyze the\neffect of this term on the spectrum, we consider both the highfrequency (\u03c9 \u001d t + |\u03bc|, i.e., much larger than the quasiparticle\nband width) and the resonant (|t \u2212 |\u03bc|| < \u03c9 < t + |\u03bc|) regimes.\nOff-resonant coupling.-For a large cavity detuning, \u03c9 \u001d\nt + |\u03bc|, all the transitions are off-diagonal, and we can employ\nsecond-order perturbation theory using the Schrieffer-Wolff\nformalism. This means diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in a\ndecoupled basis of the wire-cavity system via a unitary transe = exp (S )H exp (\u2212S ) = H + [S , H] + O(S 2 ),\nformation, H\n\u2020\nwith S = \u2212S being an anti-Hermitian operator. We leave the\ndetails for the Supplementary Material (SM) and only mention\nthat, although in this situation the photon field cannot easily\nchange the topology of the system, one can utilize the coupling to measure the topological phase of the system[32] as\nwell as the transition point. This is encoded in the cavity frequency shift \u03b4\u03c9 = 4Nt(\u03b1/\u03c9)2 \u0393(\u03bc/t) with\nZ \u03c0\n1\n1 X 2\ndk\u03b42k sin kh\u03c4kx i , (4)\n\u0393(\u03bc/t) '\n\u03b4k sin kh\u03c4kx i \u2248\nN k\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u03c0\nwhere h. . .i means averaging over the (mean-field) ground\nstate of the 1D system. The \u221a\nperturbative treatment is justified\nfor finite-size chains with \u03b1 N \u001c \u03c9. Moreover, we note that\nbesides the frequency shift, the cavity leads to a shift of the\neffective chemical potential, which is small in the perturbative\nregime (see SM). In Fig. 2, we plot \u0393(x) and \u03932 (x) \u2261 \u22022 \u0393/\u2202x2\nas a function of the chemical potential \u03bc. We see that while\n\u0393(x) varies smoothly, \u03932 (x) becomes singular at the topolog-\n\n\f3\n\nThe first term here accounts for a cavity-induced shift of the\nchemical potential, while the flip-flop coupling in the second\nterm leads to only a small mean-field chemical-potential shift\nin the ground state, similarly to the previous section (see SM).\nWith this effective interaction, it is possible to switch between\ntopologically trivial and nontrivial states by changing the photon number (which is conserved). For example, neglecting\nthe second term in Eq. (5), the first term leads to a shift in\nthe chemical potential, \u03bc \u2192 \u03bceff = \u03bc \u2212 (g2 /\u03c9)(nph + 1/2),\nwith nph \u2261 ha\u2020 ai (assuming henceforth that \u03bc > 0). If the\nsystem is in the nontopological phase in the absence of the\n2\ncavity coupling (i.e., \u03bc > t), for nph > n(c)\nph = (\u03bc \u2212 t)(\u03c9/g )\nthe effective chemical potential satisfies \u03bceff < t, thus the\nsystem crosses over to the topological phase (we neglected\nthe 1/2 part since typically this transition would happen for\nnph \u001d 1). This shows the attractiveness of such a modified\nHamiltonian, which is a quantized analogue of the one proposed in Ref. [34]. This type of Hamiltonian can, however,\nbe physically implemented only if the coupling to the cavity\nleads to changes of the pairing field.\nResonant coupling.-In the resonant regime, it is possible to change the system topology at the single-particle level\nof Eq. (1) depending on the cavity state. To see this, we\nfirst simplify Hamiltonian (1) by neglecting the \"counterrotating\" terms that are off-resonant. Leaving the details of\nthe derivation for the SM, we show here only the final result\n[in the rotated particle-hole basis as described below Eq. (2)]:\nP\n\u2206Hint = k \u03b1kx (\u03c4+k a + a\u2020 \u03c4\u2212k ), where \u03b1kx = \u03b1\u03b4k sin (2\u03b8k ). This\nclosely resembles the original Dicke Hamiltonian [35]. However, note that both the single-pseudospin splittings as well\n\n1.5\n\na)\n\n0\n\nEn (k)\n\n0.75\n\ufffd(k)\n\nical transition point, the divergence being logarithmic in nature, i.e., \u03932 (1 \u00b1 \u000f) \u221d log |\u000f|. The corresponding detection\nmethod for the transition would thus provide an optical alternative to the more conventional transport-based proposals\nsuch as that of Ref. [33].\nIn order to experimentally resolve the frequency shift, the\ncondition \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9 \u001d Q\u22121 must be met, with Q being the quality factor of the cavity. If we assume microwave\n\u221a cavities with\nQ \u223c 106 [22], and taking t/\u03c9 \u223c 10\u22121 and \u03b1 N/\u03c9 \u223c 10\u22122 ,\nwe get \u03b4\u03c9/\u03c9 \u223c 10\u22125 \u001d Q\u22121 . Note that even if the coupling\nparameter \u03b1 to the individual bonds turns out to be small, by\nassuming a large enough chain (i.e., large\n\u221a N) one can drastically enhance the effective coupling \u03b1 N to reach the strong\ncoupling regime. Moreover, since the cavity is highly detuned from any transitions in the wire, no additional relaxation\nmechanism are introduced by this coupling.\nAs an extension of our original model, Eq. (1), we may conP\nsider an alternative interaction Hamiltonian, Hint = g k (\u03c4+k a+\na\u2020 \u03c4\u2212k ), where \u03c4\u00b1k = (\u03c4kx \u00b1 i\u03c4yk )/2, which does directly affect the\ntopology of the system. Note that we do not suppose here a\nrotating-wave approximation (see below).

Left: single-particle spectrum \u000f(k) for zero photons in the\ncavity (or in the absence of the cavity). Right: single-particle spectrum in the presence of the cavity coupling, En (k), for differerent\nnumber n of photons in the cavity. For the plots we used: \u03bc = 0.3,\n\u03b1 = 0.1, \u03b2 = 0, and \u03c9 = 0.9, all in units of t. Note that these\nparameters put us in the resonant regime.\n\nas the couplings are k dependent (as opposed to the model\nin the previous section). For each individual k, the Hamiltonian reduces to the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian, which is\nblock-diagonal, with each block being a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix. Each of\nthese blocks is associated with a given value of the conserved\nquantity Ck = \u03c4zk + a\u2020 a, so that the 2 \u00d7 2 block acts in the\nsubspace {|\u2191k i \u2297 |ni, |\u2193k i \u2297 |n + 1i}. This results in an effective two-band Hamiltonian, which we can write in terms of a\npseudospin s = (s x , sy , sz ) (Pauli matrices) as follows:\n\u221a x\nn\u03b1k\n1\nsx ,\n(6)\nHn (k) = (\u000fk \u2212 \u03c9)sz +\n2\n2\nq\ngiving the spectrum En (k) = \u00b1 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u000fk )2 + n(\u03b1kx )2 /2. Note\nthat we neglected a constant shift \u2206En = (n + 1/2)\u03c9 of the\ntwo bands for a given Ck = n. For each block labelled by\nn, the spectrum has a band gap given by \u221athe strength of the\npseudospin-photon interaction \u03b1kx times n. This dramatically alters the initial spectrum \u000fk , as n increases, which is\ndepicted in Fig. 3.\nThe single-particle picture described above is intimately\nrelated to the recent developments on the topology in\nperiodically-driven systems [17\u201319]. This connection is made\nconcrete by considering the classical limit of a cavity prepared in a coherent state with n \u001d 1. Neglecting the\nphoton-number fluctuation,\nthe single-electron spectrum then\nq\n\u221a\nbecomes E\u00b1 (k) = \u00b1 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u000fk )2 + \u03a92k /2, with \u03a9k \u2261 hni\u03b1kx\nbeing the classical Rabi frequency and hni the average number of photons. The bulk topology can be correspondingly\ncharacterized by Eq. (3), with \u03b8k = arctan [\u03a9k /(\u03c9 \u2212 \u000fk )]/2.\nWe find P = 1 for t \u2212 |\u03bc| < \u03c9 < t + |\u03bc|, and zero otherwise.\nThus the topology of the electron system can be modified due\nto the interaction with the cavity.\nThe preceding results were found within a single-particle\npicture, which in fact loses its precise meaning in the manybody Dicke-model regime we are actually dealing with.\nNamely, all the pseudospins simultaneously interact with the\nsame cavity mode, and the exact many-body spectrum involves all of them. In order to simplify further progress, we\nnotice that the interacting Hamiltonian admits a conserved\n\n\f4\n\nk\n\nwhere the coefficients a and bk 's are found by solving the\nSchrodinger equation H|\u03c81tot i = E1 |\u03c81tot i[36]. The simplest\ncase is when \u03bc = 0, so that \u000fk \u2261 t, and the ground-state\nenergy\np\nis found to be E1 = \u2212(N \u2212 1)t + \u03c9/2 \u2212 N\u03931 + (t \u2212 \u03c9/2)2 ,\nP\nwith \u03931 = k (\u03b1kx )2 /N. (For a finite \u03bc , 0, the result is more\ncomplicated, albeit similar in nature.) This means the groundstate energy is lowered at resonance compared\nto the non\u221a\ninteracting situation by the amount \u221d N. If the number of\npseudospins N (or the strength of coupling \u03931 ) exceeds a critical value, the absolute ground state thus becomes populated\nwith photons. For example, in the homogeneous coupling described above E1 = E0 for \u03931 = \u03c92 /N at resonance. Although this transition is not innately topological, it can switch\nthe topology of the system. Thus, at the critical coupling, the\nsystem switches to a different ground state populated by photons, and the topology, which is related to the appearance of\nend modes, must be appropriately reexamined. To that end,\nhowever, we need to calculate the total many-body energy in\na finite system, which is beyond the single-particle bulk reasoning.\nFinite system.-The Majorana states are actually boundary\nmodes, even though their existence can be inferred from the\nbulk spectrum. We use the discrete lattice model to numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian in the zero- and one-photon\nregimes, in order to explicitly identify zero modes. We have\npreviously noted the existence of Majorana end modes of a\nfree chain for \u03bc = 0. That result is extended to \u03bc , 0, afe =\nter finding an orthogonal transformation M such that H\nPN\nP pr r 1D\np\nT\n1 2\nMH1D M = i m=1 \u000fme\n\u03b3me\n\u03b3m , with e\n\u03b3m =\nj sm j \u03b3 j (here,\nj, m = 1, . . . , N; p, r = 1, 2), smprj (t, \u03bc) being the elements of\nthe real orthogonal 2N \u00d7 2N matrix M [1]. We can write also\nN\ne1D = Pm=1\nH\n\u000fm (e\nc\u2020me\ncm \u2212 1/2), with e\nc\u2020m = (e\n\u03b3m1 + ie\n\u03b3m2 )/2, and\nthe eigenenergies \u000fn define the spectrum of the chain which\ncontain the zero modes for |\u03bc| < t.\nFocusing on the topological regime, we now analyze the\nevolution of the many-body zero mode as the first photon is\nstarting to populate the cavity. We assume the cavity frequency to satisfy (t \u2212 |\u03bc|) < \u03c9 < 2(t \u2212 |\u03bc|), which allows\nfor the resonant transitions only from the Majorana states to\n\n100\n\u03bc = 0.01\n\n\u2206Egap\n\n0.3\n\n-3\n\n\u2206Emaj\n\nP\nglobal quantity C = k \u03c4zk + a\u2020 a. The simplest situation\nis when there are no photons in the cavity and C = \u2212N/2\nreaches its lowest possible value. The combined eigenstate of\nthe system is just the product state |\u03c80tot i = |\u21d3i \u2297 |0i where\nP\n|\u21d3i \u2261 |\u2193 . . . \u2193i, and the energy E0 = \u2212 k \u000fk . For a finite\nnumber of photons in the cavity the problem becomes progressively more involved, and reasonably simple results can\nonly be found for n = 0, 1, 2, as well as for n \u001d 1 (mean\nfield), with n = C + N/2.\nWe next wish to analyze the many-body ground state (at a\nfixed-n subspace) when the cavity is populated with photons.\nWe focus only on the n = 1 case, as this already contains much\nof the relevant physics. In this case, the wave function can be\nexpanded as\nX\n|\u03c81tot i = a|\u21d3i \u2297 |1i +\nbk |\u21d3; \u2191k i \u2297 |0i ,\n(7)\n\n10\n\n\u03bc = 0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03bc = 0.3\n\n0.1\n4\n\n10-6\n\n8\n\n12\n\n16\n\n20\n\nC=0\nC=1\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n3\n\n6\n\n9\n\n12\n\n15\n\n18\n\n21\n\nN\nFIG. 4. Main: The energy splitting of the two lowest-energy states,\n\u2206Emaj , for zero (C = 0) and one excitation (C = 1), as a function of\nthe number of sites N.

Note that the parity of the\nsystem, p \u2261 \u03b311 . . . \u03b32N , is conserved, i.e., [p, H] = 0, which\nmeans this is a good quantum number even in the presence of\nthe cavity. The cavity may thus affect the splitting between the\nparities, but not mix different parities. The interaction Hamilcm ) instead\ntonian can be written in terms of the operators e\nc\u2020m (e\nof \u03c4k 's which, in the rotating-wave approximation, becomes\nP\nHint = m,mF Am f (e\ncF ,e\nc\u2020F )e\nc\u2020m a + H.c., with Am the effective\n\u2020\ncoupling and f (e\ncF ,e\ncF ) being a linear function in e\ncF ,e\nc\u2020F . As in\nthe pseudospin model, here too we can use the number of exP \u2020\ncitations C \u2261 n e\ncm + a\u2020 a as a conserved quantity for each\ncme\nparity p to find the spectrum and, as an example, we calculate\nthe energy of the system for C = 1. The corresponding eigenvalues for the two parities are found from solving the eigenvalue problem similarly to Eq. (7), which boils down (see SM\nfor details) to solving the equation\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u000f+(\u2212) \u2212\n\n0\n\u000ftot\n\n\u0011\n\n+\n\nX\nm,r,r0 ,p,p0\n\n0\n\n(\u22121)r+r (p ) S mrr S mpp\n= 0,\n0\n\u000f+(\u2212) + \u000ftot\n\u2212 2\u000fm\n0\n\n\u0010\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(8)\n\n0\nwhere \u000f\u00b1 stand for the energy of the states of parity \u00b1; \u000ftot\n=\nP\n0\n0\nrr0\nr+r0 P\n1r 2r0\n1r0 2r\nj \u000fm ; r, r , p, p = 1, 2; and S m = \u03b1i\nj (s jm s j0 \u2212 s j0 s jm )\nsetting \u03b2 = 0. The splitting between the lowest-energy\nstates of different parities in the subspace C = 1 is denoted\ngs\ngs\nby \u2206Emaj = |\u000f+ \u2212 \u000f\u2212 |, while the gap to the continuum by\ngs\ngs(es)\n\u2206Egap = min (\u000f\u00b1es ) \u2212 max (\u000f\u00b1 ), with \u000f\u00b1\nbeing the groundstate (excited-state) energies. Note that such a definition can\nbe generalized for any C \u2265 1, but not for C = 0.\nFigure 4 shows the energy splitting between the lowest energy states, \u2206Emaj , for C = 0 and C = 1, as well as the\nsplitting (gap) between these two states and the continuum,\n\u2206Egap for C = 1. We see that in both cases the splitting between the two states scales exponentially with the number of\n\n\f5\nsites, although slower for C = 1. Interestingly, the energy\ngap \u2206Egap saturates at a value \u221d \u03b1 for large N. Physically,\nthe resonant interaction brings the Majorana modes into the\ncontinuum spanned by the C = 1 states, but as this interaction increases, precisely one state per parity is pushed below\nthe continuum and span a well-defined two-dimensional degenerate subspace. These degenerate modes are highly entangled electron-photon states, which we call Majorana\u221apolaritons. Note that there is no Dicke-like enhancement N\u03b1 of\n\u2206Egap for large N (see E1 below Eq. (7)), since it is exactly\ncanceled by the overlap of\u221athe Majorana states with the continuum, which scales as 1/ N. Nevertheless, for large enough\n\u03b1, the Majorana polaritons are well defined.\nSummary.-To conclude, we analyzed the spectrum of a 1D\nKitaev chain coupled to a microwave cavity in both off- and\non-resonant regimes. An off-resonant cavity can serve as a\nmeasuring device for the topological transitions, while in the\nresonant regime the topology can be changed depending on\nthe photon number. We show that at the (mean-field) singleparticle level the spectrum maps to that of classically-driven\n(Floquet) topological insulators. In the many-body picture, we\nfind that the spectrum can exhibit a degenerate ground state\neven for a finite number of photons (despite strong hybridization of the original Majoranas with the continuum). These\nstates are entangled electron-photon composites interpreted as\nMajorana polaritons. Our model can be relevant for Ising spin\nchains [37], one-dimensional nanowires with strong SOI in\nthe presence of an s-wave superconductor [8], as well as in\nthe context of cold-atom physics [19].\nThis work was supported by the NSF under Grant No.\nDMR-0840965, the Alfred P.

We will focus on the coupling via the chemical potential since the other type of coupling (via\n\n\f6\nthe modification of t) turns out to be a straightforward extension. The BdG+cavity Hamiltonian in the k space reads H =\nHBdG + Hint + Hph :\nX\nX\nHBdG =\nnk * \u03c4k , Hint =\n\u03b1k \u03c4zk (a\u2020 + a) , Hph = \u03c9 a\u2020 a ,\n(9)\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere nk = (\u2212t sin k, 0, \u2212(t cos k + \u03bc)) and \u03b1k = \u03b1 + \u03b2 cos k. t > 0 is the hopping parameter, \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u03c9 is the\nintrinsic cavity frequency, and \u03b1 (\u03b2) are is wire-cavity coupling strengths via modification of the chemical potential (hopping\nparameter). We consider the off-resonant regime, \u03c9 \u001d t+|\u03bc|, and assume the frequency to be large enough for the interaction term\nto be treated perturbatively. The precise condition for the applicability of the perturbation theory will be discussed below. We\nuse the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to derive the second-order corrections.

We identify two distinct contributions: the purely electronic first term\nthat introduces many-body effects and the second term (dependent on the photon number) that renormalizes the p-wave pairing\nstrength. Note that the off-diagonal terms \u221d \u03b12k [(a\u2020 )2 +a2 ] were dropped here, since their subsequent Schrieffer-Wolff elimination\nwould produce higher-order terms that are outside of our scope.\nMEAN-FIELD SOLUTION FOR FREQUENCY SHIFT\n\nIn the MT, we argued that the second term in the Hamiltonian, Eq. (15), leads to a shift in the cavity frequency that can be\nmeasured, allowing to identify the transition point as well as the phase the 1D Kitaev chain is in. The corresponding expression\n\n\f7\nfor the frequency shift is\n\u03b4\u03c9 =\n\n4t X 2\n\u03b1 sin k \u03c4kx .\n\u03c92 k k\n\n(16)\n\nPerforming then the substitution \u03c4kx \u2192 h\u03c4kx i, which neglects electronic fluctuations, we obtain a frequency shift h\u03b4\u03c9i (that is\nindependent of the photon number if neglect the small backaction of this coupling on the electronic system). However, we did\nnot explicitly evaluate the average h\u03c4kx i, and, moreover, did not discuss how the first term in Eq. (15) was accounted for. Note\nthat the first term is \u221d 1/\u03c9, while the second \u221d 1/\u03c92 , i.e., much smaller in the high-frequency regime of interest. The first term,\nX \u03b1k \u03b1k0\n0\n\u2206Hint\n=\n\u03c4zk \u03c4zk0 ,\n(17)\n\u03c9\n0\nk,k\nis also special in that it leads to interaction effects. Let us first consider it separately. In a mean-field approximation, the\nmany-body effects are eliminated by the substitution:\n\u03c4zk \u03c4zk0 ' h\u03c4zk i\u03c4zk0 + \u03c4zk h\u03c4zk0 i \u2212 h\u03c4zk ih\u03c4zk0 i .\n\n(18)\n\nWe assume, furthermore, that \u03b1k \u2261 \u03b1 (i.e., there are no tunneling effects). This mean-field interaction can thus be accounted for\nby a chemical potential shift, namely \u03bc \u2192 \u03bceff = \u03bc \u2212 A with\nA=\n\n2\u03b12 X z\nh\u03c4 i ,\n\u03c9 k k\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the average h. . .i is taken self-consistently over the renormalized states. Neglecting the frequency-shift term \u221d 1/\u03c92 in\nEq. (15) (which could also be treated exactly if necessary), we can write the renormalized BdG Hamiltonian as follows:\nXh\ni\neff\n(t cos k + \u03bceff )\u03c4zk + t sin k\u03c4kx ,\n(20)\nHBdG\n=\u2212\nk\n\nwhose eigenenergies are \u000fkeff\nread:\n\nq\n= t2 + \u03bc2eff + 2t\u03bceff cos k. The expectation values for \u03c4kx,y in the ground state of this Hamiltonian\nh\u03c4kx i =\n\nt sin k\nt cos k + \u03bceff\n, h\u03c4zk i =\n,\n\u000fkeff\n\u000fkeff\n\n(21)\n\nwhich, in turn, enter in the self-consistent equation for A:\nZ\n2\u03b12 X t cos k + \u03bc \u2212 A\n\u03b12 N \u03c0 t cos k + \u03bc \u2212 A\n\u2192 A\u2212\n.\n0= A\u2212\ndk\n\u03c9 k\n\u03c0\u03c9 \u2212\u03c0\n\u000fkeff\n\u000fkeff\n\n(22)\n\nHere, we transformed the sum into an integral, supposing a large number of sites, N \u001d 1. In Fig. 5, we plot this A as a function\nof the chemical potential for several values of the dimensionless wire-cavity coupling parameter g \u2261 \u03b12 N/\u03c9t. We see that\nA follows a linear dependence for |\u03bc| \u001c t and it saturates for |\u03bc| \u001d t to values that are different depending on the coupling\nparameter g. Actually, we can obtain analytical results for A in the two limiting cases. For small |\u03bc| \u001c t, the asymptotic form is\nA = r\u03bc with the slope:\nr=\n\ng\n1+g\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03bceff = (1 \u2212 r)\u03bc =\n\n\u03bc\n,\n1+g\n\n(23)\n\nwhich means the function A can be as large as \u03bc for large N, but not exceed it. In this case, the cavity reduces the chemical potential keeping the system in the topological phase, i.e., it stabilizes it by shifting the transition point. In the opposite\n(nontopological) case, |\u03bc| \u001d t, the function r becomes instead:\n!\n!\nt2\ng\nt2\nr=\n2\u2212 2\n\u2192 \u03bceff = \u03bc \u2212 g 2 \u2212 2 .\n(24)\n\u03bc\n2\u03bc\n2\u03bc\n\u221a\nFor the perturbation theory to be internally consistent, we need to assume \u03c9 \u001d \u03b1 N, which makes\n\u221a the second term in\n\u221a Eq. (15)\nsmall compared to the hopping in HBdG . Concerning the first term in Eq. (15), it is of order (\u03b1 N/\u03c9)2 \u03c9 \u001c \u03c9 if \u03b1 N \u001c \u03c9,\n\n\f8\n\n2\n\ng\ng\ng\ng\n\nA/t\n\n1.5\n\n= 0.1\n= 0.3\n= 0.5\n=1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03bc/t\n\n6\n\n8\n\nFIG. 5. The cavity-induced chemical potential shift A as a function of the bare chemical potential \u03bc (in units of t) for different values of the\neffective coupling strength g = \u03b12 N/t\u03c9.\n\nwhich can, nevertheless, be still comparable or even larger than t and/or |\u03bc|. A more stringent condition, g \u001c 1, would assure\nthat \u2206Hint causes only small shifts in the electronic spectral properties. We can finally express the frequency shift \u03b4\u03c9 using the\nself-consistent wave functions to find:\nZ\nsin2 k\n2t2 g \u03c0\nt sin2 k\n4t2 \u03b12 X\n=\ndk\n,\n(25)\nh\u03b4\u03c9i =\nq\nq\n\u03c0\u03c9 \u2212\u03c0\n\u03c92 k\nt2 + \u03bc2eff + 2t\u03bceff cos k\nt2 + \u03bc2eff + 2t\u03bceff cos k\nwhich reduces to the expression used in the MT. As can be seen from Fig. 5, for g \u001c 1, we can approximate \u03bceff \u2248 \u03bc. In the\nMT, we wrote h\u03b4\u03c9i = 4Nt(\u03b1/\u03c9)2 \u0393(\u03bc/t) and plotted both \u0393(x) and \u03932 (x) \u2261 \u22022 \u0393/\u2202x2 . While the general expression for \u0393(x) is\ntoo lengthy to be showed here, there are limiting cases when this becomes very simple. We will thus provide the expressions for\n\u0393(x) and \u03932 (x) for the regimes x \u001c 1, x ' 1, and x \u001d 1. For \u0393(x), we obtain:\n!\n\uf8f1\nx2\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n\u2212\n, for x \u001c 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n2\n8\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 2\n\u0393(x) = \uf8f4\n(26)\n(3 \u2212 x) , for x ' 1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n3\u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n,\nfor x \u001d 1\n2x\nwhich implies that h\u03b4\u03c9i\u03bc=0 = 2tN(\u03b1/\u03c9)2 (maximum), and it scales as h\u03b4\u03c9i \u223c 1/\u03bc for \u03bc \u001d t. This means that h\u03b4\u03c9i is just a\nfraction of the hopping parameter t. Note also that the function \u0393(x) is continuos at x = 1, so there is no jump in the frequency\nshift. On the other hand, the limiting expressions for \u03932 (x) read:\n!\n\uf8f1\n3 2\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u2212 1 + x , for x \u001c 1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n8\n4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 1\n\u03932 (x) = \uf8f4\n(27)\nlog |x \u2212 1| , for x ' 1 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n,\nfor x \u001d 1\nx3\nwhich diverges logarithmicaly as x \u2192 1.\nROTATING-WAVE APPROXIMATION FOR FINITE-CHAIN SPECTRUM\n\nIn this section, we derive the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) Hamiltonian for a finite chain, as well as the resulting\neigenenergy equation for C = 1 [Eq.

Sketch of the energy-level structure for the one-excitation regime (C = 1). The Majorana states in the absence of cavity (left) for parity\n+ (red) and \u2212 (blue) are brought into the continuum via the interaction with the cavity. As \u03b1 is increased, precisely one state for each parity\nis pushed below the continuum to form new Majoranas, now highly-entangled electron-photon states that can be called Majorana polaritons.\nHere, \u03bc is the chemical potential, \u2206g stands for the initial gap from the zero mode to the continuum (in the absence of cavity), and \u03c9 is the\ncavity frequency.\n\nWe can now put everything together to find the equations for the energy:\nX\nX\nX\nX\n0\n0\n0\nj\nj\n(\u22121) p+p S mpp bm\nS pp\n\u000fm (1 \u2212 2\u03b4 j,m ) ,\n\u000fa0 = (\u03c9 \u2212\n\u000fm )a0 +\n1 , \u000fb1 = a0\nj \u2212 b1\n\u000fa1 = (\u03c9 \u2212\n\nm\n\nm,p,p0\n\nX\n\nX\n\nm\n\n\u000fm )a1 +\n\nm,p,p0\n\np,p0\n\n(\u22121)\n\np\u22121\n\n0\nS mpp bm\n0\n\n,\n\n\u000fb0j\n\n= a1\n\nX\np,p0\n\n(\u22121)\n\nm\np0 \u22121\n\nS\n\npp0\nj\n\n\u2212 b0j\n\nX\n\n\u000fm (1 \u2212 2\u03b4 j,m ) ,\n\n(44)\n\nm\n\nm\nwhere it is evident that we are getting two decoupled sets of equations for each parity: (a0 , {bm\n1 }) and (a1 , {b0 }). One can easily\nobtain from these relations the eigenenergy equations:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n0 0\n0\nX \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 X X\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n(\u22121)r+p (r ) S mrr S mpp\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\u03c9 \u2212 \u000f+(\u2212) \u2212\n\uf8f7\nP\n\u000f j \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 +\n= 0,\n(45)\n\uf8ed\n\u000f\n+ m0 \u000fm0 (1 \u2212 2\u03b4mm0 )\nm,r,r0 p,p0 +(\u2212)\nj\n\nfor the parity p = +(\u2212), which are quoted in the MT. Besides the spectrum \u000f we can also extract the set of coefficients\n(a0(1) , {bm\n1(0) }) (together with the normalization condition), which quantify the amount of photon-electron entanglement in the\nsystem. In the MT, we argued that the spectrum obtained by solving the Eq. (45) yields one state for each parity emerging below\nthe continuum of C = 1 states for sufficiently large coupling strenght \u03b1, which are degenerate (i.e., exponentially small splitting\nin the number of sites N). These states, which we called Majorana polaritons, are shown schematically in Fig. 6. While for\nvanishingly small \u03b1 the initially isolated Majoranas get mixed with the C = 1 continuum of states, as \u03b1 is increased further, new\nMajoranas reemerge, with well-defined parity and energy.\n\n\f"}
