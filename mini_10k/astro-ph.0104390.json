VAN DER S WALUW 1 , Y. W U 2\n\narXiv:astro-ph/0104390v2 1 Jun 2001\n\nDraft version October 22, 2018\n\nABSTRACT\nWe propose a method to infer the initial spin period of pulsars residing in composite supernova remnants.\nSuch a remnant consists of both a plerionic and a shell type component, corresponding respectively to the pulsar\nwind nebula driven by the spindown luminosity of the central pulsar, and the blastwave bounding the supernova\nremnant. Theoretical investigations including hydrodynamical simulations have shown that at late times (\u223c 1,000\n- 10,000 years), a simple scaling law connects the radius of the supernova shell to the radius of the plerion. The\nenergy content of the plerion and the total mechanical energy of the supernova remnant enter into this scaling law.\nOne can use this scaling law to estimate the initial spin period of pulsars residing in composite remnants. We\ndiscuss potential pitfalls of this method, including the effect of a small remnant age and of strong radiative losses\nin the plerion.\nSubject headings: hydrodynamics-(ISM:) supernova remnants-(stars:) pulsars: general\nite supernova remnant (SNR) includes both a plerionic (filledcentered) component (Weiler & Panagia 1978) and a shell component. The first corresponds to the pulsar wind nebula (PWN),\nwhile the latter corresponds to the blastwave of the supernova\nremnant (SNR) propagating through the interstellar medium\n(ISM). They are observationally distinguished by a different\nspectral power-law index at radio frequencies. The dynamics\nof such a composite system has been extensively studied, e.g.\nReynolds & Chevalier (1984); Chevalier & Fransson (1992).\nRecently, van der Swaluw et al. (2001) presented hydrodynamical simulations and analytical arguments which explicitly\nrelate the radius of the PWN to that of the SNR. These authors\nfind that the two radii are roughly proportional some time after the initial explosion, with the proportionality constant determined by the ratio of the pulsar spin-down energy and the total\nmechanical energy of the supernova event. This relation forms\nthe theoretical basis for the current paper. In this article, we\nfollow van der Swaluw et al. (2001) in restricting ourselves to\nspherically symmetric systems.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nIs a typical neutron star born spinning close to break-up\n(P0 \u223c 0.8 ms, Haensel et al. 1995). The answer to this question reveals much about the angular momentum evolution of\nneutron star progenitors (Heger et al. 2000), as well as about\nthe processes that occur during the supernova explosion (Spruit\n& Phinney 1998, Lai & Goldreich 2000). If the initial spin-rate\nis close to the break-up rate, the nascent neutron star may undergo a Rossby-wave instability (Lindblom, Owen & Morsink\n1998) and emit gravitational radiation. Moreover, a rapidly rotating neutron star can obtain a substantial kick velocity through\nthe electromagnetic rocket effect (Harrison & Tademaru 1975).\nThis can provide a natural explanation for the apparent alignment between the spin axis and pulsar proper motion (Lai et\nal. 2001) in the Crab (Caraveo & Mignani 1999) and Vela pulsar (Pavlov et al. 2000).\nA number of studies have been dedicated to the determination of initial spin-rates. Those few young pulsars which have\nmeasured braking indices and estimated ages seem to possess\ninitial spin periods from 19 ms (Crab, Lyne et al. 1993) to 63 ms\n(PSR B1509-58, Kaspi et al. 1994).3 Since only rapidly rotating\npulsars have measurable braking indicies, these values may not\nbe representative for the general population. For these, Phinney & Blandford (1981) and Vivekanand & Narayan (1981)\nhave developed the pulsar-current analysis. Unfortunately,\nthis method is subject to small-number statistics (Lorimer et\nal. 1993). Analysis based on pulsar luminosity functions (Emmering & Chevalier 1989, Narayan 1987) raised the possibility\nof 'injection': the majority of the pulsars may be born with periods as slow as several hundred milliseconds. This hypothesis is\ncorroborated by the apparent paucity of plerions around neutron\nstars (Srinivasan et al. 1984). A plerion derives energy from the\nrotational energy of the central pulsar. The overall conclusion\nfrom pulsar studies seems to favour a slow initial spin rate.\nIn this article, we propose a new method for inferring the\ninitial spin-rates of some neutron stars \u2013 the small population\nthat reside within composite supernova remnants. A compos-\n\n2. EVOLUTION OF A PWN IN A SNR\n\nAs a pulsar spins down, its rotational energy is largely deposited into the surrounding medium, driving a relativistic pulsar wind into the tenuous bubble of stellar debris left behind by\nthe supernova blastwave. We approximate the spin-down luminosity of the pulsar wind by that of a rotating magnetic dipole:\n\u00012\nL(t) = L0 / 1 + t/\u03c4 .\n(1)\n\nThe total spin-down energy is Esd = L0 \u03c4 . We neglect the dynamical influence of the pulsar wind on the SNR, assuming that\nEsd is well below the total mechanical energy of the supernova\nexplosion, E0 \u223c 1051 erg.\nThe evolution of a PWN inside a SNR can be divided into\ntwo stages (Reynolds & Chevalier 1984; Chevalier & Fransson 1992). In the first stage, the PWN expands supersonically\nwithin the bubble blown out by the SNR. The second stage\ncommences at t \u2261 tST when the PWN encounters the reverse\nshock of the SNR. The reverse shock heats the interior of the\n\n1 E.vanderswaluw@astro.uu.nl,\n\nAstronomical Institute, Utrecht University, P.O.

In this stage the expansion of the PWN is regulated by\nthe expansion of the SNR, which is described by a self-similar\nSedov-Taylor solution. In the following we summarize some\nrelevant results from Chevalier & Fransson (1992) and van der\nSwaluw et al. (2001).\n2.1. Analytical Relations\nWe focus on the subsonic expansion stage of the PWN which\noccurs when the SNR has relaxed to the Sedov solution. We\nassume that the pulsar wind has deposited most of its energy\ninto the PWN (t \u226b \u03c4 ). We find that the radius of the PWN\n(Rpwn ) scales roughly linearly with the radius of the SNR (Rsnr ).\nThis scaling arises from the condition of pressure equillibrium\nbetween the PWN interior and the interior of the SNR. We approximate the pressure which confines the PWN by the central\npressure of the SNR, using the Sedov solution (Sedov 1958),\nPsnr \u2243 0.074E0/R3snr ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere E0 is the total mechanical energy of the SNR. Inside the\nPWN, pressure\n\u221a is quickly equilibrated due to the high sound\nspeed \u223c c/ 3 of the relativistic fluid. The interior pressure is\nrelated to the energy content of the PWN, E\u2217 , by\nPpwn \u2243\n\n3(\u03b3 \u2212 1) E\u2217\n,\n4\u03c0 R3pwn\n\n1/3\n\nunity. The second parameter is defined as \u03b73 (t) = C\u0304\u03b72 \u2264 C\u0304.\nThe maximum value of \u03b73 = C\u0304 is used when we determine the\ninitial spin periods of pulsars driving composite remnants.\nThe derivation leading up to equation (5) is invalid during\nthe earlier supersonic evolution. We retain equation (5) with\nthe sole purpose of defining \u03b73 during these stages. We proceed to demonstrate the behaviour of \u03b73 throughout the PWN\nevolution with results from hydrodynamical simulations.\n\n2.2. Hydrodynamical Simulations\nVan der Swaluw et al. (2001) have presented hydrodynamical simulations of a pulsar wind nebula inside a supernova\nremnant. In these simulations, the gasdynamical equations are\nintegrated in a spherically symmetric configuration, using the\nVersatile Advection Code (VAC) developed by G\u00e1bor T\u00f3th at\nthe Astronomical Institute Utrecht (T\u00f3th and Odstr\u010dil 1996).\nLacking the possibility of treating a relativistic fluid, the pulsar wind has been implemented as a cold non-relativistic wind\n(\u03b3 = 5/3) with a terminal velocity equal to the speed of light,\nv\u221e = [2L(t)/\u1e40pw(t)]1/2 \u2243 c, where \u1e40pw (t) is the mass ejection\nrate into the pulsar wind bubble, and L(t) is the pulsar spindown luminosity as given by equation (1).\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the adiabatic index. Let Epwn be the total amount\nof energy injected into the PWN by the central pulsar. Part of\nthis energy is used to perform work on the surrounding medium\nas the PWN expands. Despite some compression of the PWN\nby the reverse shock around t = tST , E\u2217 falls below Epwn (see\nFig. 9 of van der Swaluw et al. (2001)). We therefore write\nE\u2217 = \u03b72 Epwn with \u03b72 < 1 decreasing over time. Imposing pressure equilibrium, we find\nRpwn = C\u0304 E\u2217 /E0\n\n\u00011/3\n\nRsnr ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere C\u0304 \u2243 1.02 for a relativistic fluid (\u03b3 = 4/3) and C\u0304 \u2243 1.29\nfor a non-relativistic fluid (\u03b3 = 5/3).\nIn the absence of radiative losses, the subsonic expansion of\n\u03b3\nthe PWN is adiabatic, PpwnVpwn\n= constant, where Vpwn \u221d R3pwn\nis the volume of the PWN. Combining this relation with equation (3), we find that E\u2217 falls off with time as t \u22123/10 for a relativistic fluid. This yields an expansion law for the radius of the\nPWN, Rpwn \u221d t 3/10 , whereas the radius of the SNR scales as in\na Sedov solution (Rsnr \u221d t 2/5 ). So, roughly, Rpwn \u221d Rsnr .\nWe introduce two additional dimensionless parameters, \u03b71\nand \u03b73 , and rewrite equation (4) into a form that can be more\neasily compared with simulations,\nRpwn (t) = \u03b73 (t) \u03b71 Esd /E0\n\n\u00011/3\n\nRsnr (t).\n\n(5)\n\nThe parameter \u03b71 is a constant and relates the total energy input\ninto the PWN, Epwn , to the total spin-down energy of the pulsar,\nEsd as Epwn = \u03b71 Esd . This takes into account possible radiative\nlosses in the PWN, and other inefficiencies in the conversion of\nthe spin-down energy into mechanical energy. For instance, a\nfraction of the neutron star spin-down energy may escape directly from the pulsar as high energy radiation. We set \u03b71 = 1\nin this article, but discuss the case when it is much less than\n\nF IG . 1.- Results of numerical simulation showing the time evolution of the\npulsar wind nebula. Plotted here are its radius (in units of parsec, thin continued line) and the dimensionless parameter \u03b73 (thick line). The latter is disected\ninto three parts: a supersonic expansion stage when the PWN is bounded by a\nshock (dotted section), in unsteady transition when undergoing reverberation\nwith the supernova reverse shock (dashed section), and subsonic expansion\n(solid section). The parameters adopted in this simulation is: maximum spindown luminosity L0 = 5 \u00d7 1038 ergs/s, spin-down time \u03c4 = 600 yrs, supernova\nexplosion energy of E0 = 1051 ergs and ISM density of 10\u221224 g/cm3 . We find\ntST \u223c 103 yrs in this case. Note that \u03b73 is not physical in the early expansion\nstages but is only formally defined by equation (5). For details, see van der\nSwaluw et al. (2001).\n\nFigure 1 presents relevant results from one of these simulations. The numerical parameters adopted in this simulation\nare listed in the caption. Taking different parameters will not\nqualitatively change the overall behaviour of the system, but\nit will affect the early (supersonic) evolution and the moment\nwhen subsonic expansion commences (tST ). For example, tST\nis larger if the supernova explosion is more energetic, if the supernova ejecta mass is larger, or if the interstellar medium den\u22121/2 5/6 \u22121/3\nsity is smaller (tST \u221d E0 Mej \u03c1ism , e.g. McKee & Truelove\n(1995)). Since this is a non-relativistic simulation (\u03b3 = 5/3), we\nexpect \u03b73 \u2264 C\u0304 = 1.29 in the subsonic expansion stage. This is\nindeed observed. Therefore in the following investigation we\nassume a maximum value for \u03b73 of 1.02, as is appropriate for\nthe subsonic expansion stage of a PWN in a SNR with \u03b3 = 4/3.\n\n\fInferring neutron star initial spin periods\n3. INFERRING INITIAL SPIN RATES\n\nWriting the spin-down energy as Esd = (\u03a920 \u2212 \u03a9t2 )I/2, we obtain the following expression for the pulsar's initial spin period,\n\u0012\n\u00133 \u0012 \u00132 !\u22121/2\n2\u03c0\n2E0 Rpwn\n+\n,\n(6)\nP0 = 2\u03c0\n\u03b71 I \u03b73 Rsnr\nPt\nwhere the spin-periods are P0 \u2261 2\u03c0/\u03a90 , Pt \u2261 2\u03c0/\u03a9t and I is the\nmoment of inertia of the neutron star. The radius of a PWN relative to its associated SNR shell can be used to infer the initial\nspin-period of the pulsar, assuming \u03b71 , \u03b73 , E0 and \u03a9t are known\nor can be estimated.\n\nF IG . 2.- Initial spin periods inferred from the ratio Rpwn /Rsnr using equation (6). When assuming no radiative loss (\u03b71 = 1), we obtain solutions as\ndepicted by the family of solid lines, with different lines applicable for different current spin periods, Pt . The family of dashed lines are for \u03b71 = 0.05. Filled\nand open triangles represent systems listed in Table 1 for \u03b71 = 1 and \u03b71 = 0.05,\nrespectively. When P0 \u2264 4 ms, the initial rotational energy of the puslar exceeds the total mechanical energy in the SNR itself. Equation (6) fails and the\nSNR may be blown away by the PWN. None of the systems we examined lies\nclose to this limit.\n\nThe radius of PWN should be taken from radio measurements. Synchrotron-radiating electrons in PWN have a typical\nlife-time (Rybicki & Lightman 1979):\n\u03c41/2 =\n\n6\u03c0me c\n\u22123/2 \u22121/2\n\u223c 105 BmG \u03bdMHz yrs,\n\u03c3T B2 \u0393\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c3T is the Thomson cross-section, \u0393 is the electron\nLorentz factor, \u03bd is the typical synchrotron frequency scaled\nat the radio wavelength, and B is the magnetic field strength\nscaled by a value appropriate for plerions. Such a long life-time\nimplies that radio observations 'see' electrons that were accelerated during the early energetic stage when the pulsar deposits\nmost of its rotational energy into the pulsar wind. They therefore delineates the true spatial extent of the plerion. In contrast,\nX-ray electrons loose their energy quickly. The X-ray plerion\nis produced by electrons recently accelerated near the pulsar, so\none ecpects the plerion to be smaller in X-rays.\nWe have collected from the literature 13 composite supernova remnants. We list the relevant properties of these systems in Table 1. The relative sizes of the plerions are taken\nfrom radio observations, with the exception of G11.2 \u2212 0.3 and\nG320.4 \u2212 1.2 (marked by asterisks), where only X-ray plerions\nhave been observed. We apply equation (6) to determine the initial spin period for these systems, adopting \u03b71 = 1.0, \u03b73 = 1.02,\n4 G11.2 \u2212 0.3\n\n3\n\nE0 = 1.0 \u00d7 1051 erg, I = 1.4 \u00d7 1045 g cm2 (the value for Crab),\nand Pt = 2\u03c0/\u03a9t = \u221e in cases where it is unknown. The same\nresults appear in Figure 2 as filled triangles. By taking the maximum value for \u03b73 we probably under-estimate the initial spin\nrate, but likely by no more than a factor of 2 judging from Figure 1. In the same table we also list the initial spin periods (P0\u2032 )\nderived for 4 pulsars using braking index measurements.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have demonstrated a new method for inferring initial spin\nrates of pulsars residing in composite supernova remnants. This\nmethod uses the ratio of the plerion radius and the radius of the\nsupernova shell, so we dub it as the 'radius method'. Given that\ntypical plerions and supernova remnants are expected to live for\n103 \u2212 104 years, we expect that future observations will increase\nthe population to which the radius method can be applied.\nThis method does not require a knowledge of parameters like\nthe density and magnetic field strength of the ISM, or the distance and age of the SNR. However, for the method to apply,\nthe observed PWN has to be in the subsonic stage of its evolution. If this is not the case, the method systematically overestimates the initial spin rate (see below). Uncertainties in E0 ,\n\u03b73 and \u03a9t introduce errors of order unity, as will a deviation\nfrom pure spherical symmetry. A more important uncertainty\nof this new method concerns the influence of synchrotron radiative losses in the plerion, as parametrized by \u03b71 . We tend\nto under-estimate the initial spin-rate by ignoring these losses\n(setting \u03b71 = 1). We will illustrate the effect of these uncertainties by considering the 4 systems in Table 1, which have known\ncentral pulsars, and independent estimates for their initial periods based on measurements of the pulsar breaking index.4\nAmong these systems, Vela is the oldest and should have entered the subsonic expansion stage. Its associated pulsar being\ndisplaced from the center of the plerion also testifies in favor of\nan old age. Adopting \u03b73 = 1.02 and other parameters as stated,\nthe radius method yields an initial spin-down energy for Vela\nthat is a factor of 2 above that inferred by Lyne et al. (1996)\nfrom pulsar braking index measurement. This is surprising as\nwe have ignored radiative loss. We suggest three possibilities\nthat will reconcile the two methods: (1) the supernova explosion is half as energetic as assumed here, (2) the pulsar is 15\nkyr old, and (3) the braking index is as high as 2.4 (Lyne et\nal. 1996 reported 1.4). The first option will raise P0 to 52 ms\nwhile the latter two will reduce P0\u2032 to 41 ms.\nThe remaining two systems, G11.2 \u2212 0.3 and G320.4 \u2212 1.2,\nare young (\u223c 1.5 kyr). Their plerions could still be in supersonic expansion during which the value of \u03b73 (defined formally\nthrough equation (5) in the supersonic stage) can be higher than\n1.02, the theoretical maximum during the subsonic expansion\nstage (Fig. 1 and \u00a72 of van der Swaluw et al. 2001). For example, taking \u03b73 = 2 we find P0 = 63 ms for G11.2 \u2212 0.3. A similar\ncorrection may have to be applied to G29.7 \u2212 0.3 (Kes 75).\nIn contrast to the systems discussed above, SNR 0540 \u2212 69.3\nis the only case in which the spin-down energy is significantly\nunder-estimated for our choice of parameters. The plerion in\nSNR 0540 \u2212 69.3 is too small if the pulsar was indeed born with\nan initial spin of 39 ms. Manchester et al. (1993) have argued\nthat the radiative loss in this system has reduced the total energy\nstored in the plerionic magnetic field and relativistic electrons\nto a mere 4% of the integrated spin-down luminosity of the pulsar. Taking \u03b71 = 0.04 we recover a 39 ms initial period, with a\n\ndoes not have a braking index measurement. But its inferred initial spin depends little on this index due to its small age.\n\n\f4\n\nvan der Swaluw & Wu\nSupernova\nDesignation\nG0.9 + 0.1\nG16.7 + 0.1\nG29.7 \u2212 0.3\nG34.7 \u2212 0.4\nG293.8 + 0.6\nG322.5 \u2212 0.1\nG326.3 \u2212 1.8\nG327.1 \u2212 1.1\nG351.2 + 0.1\nG263.9 \u2212 3.3\nG11.2 \u2212 0.3\u2217\nG320.4 \u2212 1.2\u2217\nSNR0540 \u2212 69.3\n\nPlerion\nRpwn /Rsnr\n0.25(Helfand & Becker 1987)\n0.25(Helfand et al. 1989)\n0.16(Becker & Helfand 1984)\n0.07(Frail et al. 1996)\n0.25(Whiteoak & Green 1996)\n0.27(Whiteoak 1992)\n0.28(Kassim et al. 1993)\n0.25(Sun et al. 1999)\n0.05(Becker & Helfand 1988)\n0.24(Milne 1980)\n0.15(Vasisht et al. 1996)\n0.17(Seward et al. 1983)\n0.08(Manchester et al. 1993)\n\nP0 (in msec)\n43\n43\n82\n197\n43\n39\n37\n43\n484\n41\n53\n69\n49\n\nPulsar\nPt (in msec)\nP0\u2032 (in msec)\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n325[PSR 1846-0258]\n\u2013\n267[PSR 1853+01]\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n89[Vela]\n52(Lyne et al. 1996)\n65\n63(Torii et al. 1999)\n150[PSR B1509-58]\n63(Kaspi et al. 1994)\n50.3[PSR 0540-69]\n39(Deeter et al. 1999)\n\nage\n(kyr)\n\u2013\n\u2013\n0.7\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n11.3\n1.6\n1.5\n0.8\n\nTABLE 1\nL IST OF\n\nCOMPOSITE REMNANTS : P0 IS THE INITIAL SPIN PERIOD FROM THE RADIUS METHOD , Pt IS THE CURRENT SPIN PERIOD OF\n\u2032\nSYSTEMS WITH IDENTIFIED PULSARSQ AND P0 IS THE CALCULATED INITIAL SPIN PERIOD BY USING THE BRAKING INDEX .\n\nvalue of \u03b73 = 1.3. This value of \u03b73 is reasonable because SNR\n0540 \u2212 69.3 is only 760 years old. None of the other 3 systems discussed here requires strong synchrotron losses in the\nplerion, which makes SNR 0540 \u2212 69.3 unique. Among the 4\npulsars, PSR 0540 \u2212 69 is not outstanding either in its surface\nmagnetic field strength or in its spin-down rate. It is likely born\nthe fastest, though not by a large margin.\nAlong the same line, Atoyan (1999) have argued that in Crab,\nstrong synchrotron losses in its past can account for the observed flat spectra of the radio electrons in the plerion. If this\napplies to all PWNe, it would significantly change our inferred\ninitial spin rates. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 for a strong synchrotron loss of \u03b71 = 0.05.\nAlthough the effect of radiative losses on the reliability of our\nresults remain unclear, we briefly explore the implications of\nthese results. Our sample (table 1) is likely biased towards fast\n\nspinners, which produce plerions that are easier to detect. Even\nso, all pulsars in our sample seem to be born spinning much\nbelow the break-up rate. Moreover, their initial spin-periods do\nnot cluster around \u223c 5 \u2212 10 ms, a signature of rapid spin-down\nby the gravitationally radiating Rossby-waves which occur immediately after the supernova collapse (Andersson et al. 2000,\nWu et al. 2001). The long initial periods we find imply an effective angular momentum coupling between the core and envelope of neutron star progenitors until late into their evolution.\nThe scattering in the initial periods could either reflect a different decoupling time in different stars, or a stochastic process\nthat gives rise to the final angular momentum in the neutron\nstar, such as an off-centered kick during the collapse (Spruit &\nPhinney 1998).\nWe acknowledge discussions with Bram Achterberg, Armen\nAtoyan and an anonymous referee.\n\nREFERENCES\nAndersson, N., Jones, D.
