Here we report on the dependence of the\ntunneling quasiparticle charge, as determined via highly sensitive shot noise measurements, on\nthe measurement conditions, in the odd denominators states \u03bd=1/3 and \u03bd=7/3 and in the even\ndenominator state \u03bd=5/2. In particular, for very weak backscattering probability and sufficiently\nsmall excitation energies (temperature and applied voltage), tunneling charges across a\nconstriction were found to be significantly higher than the theoretically predicted fundamental\nquasiparticle charges.\n\n1\n\n\fOdd denominator fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) states [1, 2], whose quasiparticles are\nexpected to possess fractional statistics, have been already the focus of extensive studies [3].\nHowever, more recently, particular attention was devoted to the even denominator fractional\nstate \u03bd=5/2 [4], which is conjectured to be described by a Pfaffian wavefunction [5-7], mainly\ndue to the expectation that its quasiparticles carry a charge e/4 and obey non-abelian statistics [5,\n8-10]. As such, these quasiparticles may be useful for topological quantum computation [11-13].\nAn important step in the experimental study of the FQHE states is the determination of the\nquasiparticle charge. While the fundamental quasiparticle charge in the bulk for a fractional\nstate is expected to be unique, the charge that tunnels between two counter propagating edgeschannels might depend on the measurement conditions. Here we study the uniqueness of the\ntunneling charge, and search for conditions under which it is equal to the expected fundamental\nquasiparticle charge.\n\nMost charge measurements detect charges that tunnel either across a narrow constriction, via\nshot noise measurements [14-18], conductance measurements [19] and interference [20, 21], or\ncharges that tunnel into localized states in the bulk [22], which, in all cases, are not guaranteed to\nbe equal to the fundamental quasiparticle charge in the bulk. Moreover, the excitation energy\n(applied voltage and temperature) is also expected to affect the tunneling charge. However,\nsince charges that tunnel between edges can only be integer multiples of the fundamental charge,\nthe smallest measured charge sets an upper bound for the fundamental charge. For example, a\nmeasurement in the \u03bd=5/2 state of a charge e/4 rules out e/2 fundamental charges in this state.\nWe present here measurement results of low frequency shot noise generated by partitioning.\nThis work was motivated by our attempt to improve the accuracy of our previous measurements\n\n2\n\n\fand tighten the data points with more sensitive measurements, thus allowing us to determine the\ncharge in a previously inaccessible low energy and very weak backscattering regimes \u2013 where\nshot noise is excessively small. Our new measurements revealed an interesting dependence of\nthe conductance and the tunneling charge on the energy and the transmission probability. The\nuniversality of these results was tested in a few fractional states, v=1/3, v=7/3, and v=5/2, where\nin all cases the conductance behaved in a highly characteristic way and the tunneling charge was\nfound to be unexpectedly large in the very low energy and weak backscattering limits.\n\nMeasurements in the 2nd Landau level (v=5/2, v=7/3) were conducted on four different samples,\nwhich were fabricated on two different GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. The first (second)\nheterostructure, on which samples #1, #2 and #3 (sample #4) were fabricated, embedded a 2DEG\nconfined in a 30nm wide quantum well (described by Umansky et al. [23]) with an areal electron\ndensity 2.9\u00d71011cm-2 (3.2\u00d71011cm-2) and a low temperature mobility of 29\u00d7106cm2/V-s\n(30.5\u00d7106cm2/V-s) - both measured in the dark. Hall measurement, taken in the ungated area of\nsample #1, is shown in Fig. 1a. Five significant fractional states, v=11/5, 7/3, 5/2, 8/3, & 14/5,\nare prominent (with Rxx~0 for v=5/2). Current was restricted by mesa etching, with the narrowest\npart being 5\u03bcm wide (see Fig. 1b). A metallic (15nm PdAu / 15nm Au) split-gate was deposited\nin the narrow part of the mesa; with split-gate separations 1\u03bcm, 1.2\u03bcm and 1.4\u03bcm. Studies in the\n1st Landau level (v=1/3) were carried on sample #5, fabricated on a heterostructure embedding a\n2DEG with an areal electron density 1.1\u00d71011cm-2 and low temperature (dark) mobility\n2\u00d7106cm2/V-s, with split-gate separation of 350nm.\n\nBackscattering of edge channels was\n\nachieved by applying negative voltage to the split-gate with respect to the 2DEG. Note that\nrelatively small gate voltages were needed, which in general only partly depleted the 2DEG\n\n3\n\n\funder the gate (e.g., the gate voltage range used for bulk filling factor v=5/2 in sample #1 was\nVg=-0.08V....-1.115V, while the full depletion voltage was -1.55V); however, the measured shot\nnoise was universally found to depend on the transmission probability and not on the actual\nshape of the partitioning barrier (see for example Refs. [16-18, 24]).\n\nDetermination of charge from shot noise measurements was done via a rather simple analysis\nthat has proven to be successful in determining the tunnelling quasiparticle charges in a variety\nof filling factors [14, 16-18, 24, 25]. The correctness of the analysis was validated in these\nearlier works by verifying the theoretically expected fundamental quasiparticle charge at\nsufficiently high temperatures, when the behavior is 'single-particle-like' and the conductance is\nlinear. Charges e/3, e/5, e/7, e/4 were measured at v=1/3, 2/5, 3/7, 5/2 respectively, and an\nelectron charge was measured in the integer regime. As will be discussed below, more advanced\napproaches, which rely on modeling the edge channel as a chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) [26, 27],\nwere found not to be applicable for our configuration.\n\nOur analysis assumed stochastic\n\npartitioning of shot-noise-free current carried by independent charged particles, emanating from\na reservoir at finite temperature T. The partitioning leads to a binomial distribution of the\npartitioned particles [14-18, 28-31]. For multiple channel transport, partitioning the ith channel,\nwhich flows along the boundary between filling factors \u03bdi and \u03bdi-1, leads to finite temperature low\nfrequency spectral density of the current shot noise, Si(Vsd,\u03c9~0,T), with the partitioned\nquasiparticle charge e* [29, 30]:\n\uf8ee\ne\u2217V\n2k T \uf8f9\nS i (Vsd , 0)T = 2e*Vsd \u2206gi t\u03bd i \u2212\u03bd i \u22121 (1 \u2212 t\u03bd i \u2212\u03bd i \u22121 ) \uf8efcoth( sd ) \u2212 \u2217 B \uf8fa + 4k BTg ,\n2 k BT\ne Vsd \uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\n4\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere Vsd is the applied DC excitation voltage, \u2206gi=gi-gi-1, with g j = \u03bd j e2 / h , t\u03bd i \u2212\u03bd i \u22121 =\n\ng \u2212 gi \u22121\n\u2206 gi\n\nis the transmission probability of the ith channel, and g the two-terminal (Hall) conductance. In\norder to determine \u2206gi and t\u03bd i \u2212\u03bd i\u22121 , the next-lower-lying-state i-1, which traverses freely through\nthe partitioning constriction, must be identified. Note that when channels 1 to i-1 traverse with\nunity probability, while the ith channel is fully reflected, the two-terminal conductance, which is\nquantized at gi \u22121 = \u03bd i \u22121e2 / h , is mostly current independent and the traversing current is shotnoise-free (see [18] for more details).\n\nPinching the constriction to fully reflect the ith channel, being it v=5/2 or v=7/3, the next-lowerlying state was identified in al cases to be \u03bd=2. For v=1/3 the lower-lying state is vacuum.\nFocusing on the dependence of the transmission coefficient on the excitation voltage, a\nrepeatable behavior was observed. At high transmissions of the constriction (at small negative\nvoltage on the split-gate), the differential conductance had a 'mound-like' dependence on the\nexcitation voltage (a maximum at zero excitation voltage), while at low transmissions the\nconductance exhibited a 'valley-like' dependence (a minimum at zero excitation voltage). Such\nbehavior was universally observed in the past, for all filling factors (integer or fractional) [18, 24,\n32], being a characteristic of an induced scattering potential by a finite size potential formed, as\nan example, by the split-gate (with complete or partial depletion under the gate). Such nonlinear behavior, and in particular the 'mound-like' dependence of the conductance, is not\nexpected by a theory that models the edge channel by a CLL with a point-like scatterer - since it\ndisregards realistic effects such as the spatial size of the scatterer and the dependence of the\nscatterer potential height on the applied excitation voltage.\n\n5\n\nHence, available theoretical\n\n\fpredictions for the shot noise are also not applicable for the analysis of our experiments [24, 26,\n27]. We would like to stress that a charge e was always observed in the integer regime by\nemploying Eq. 1. This was independent if the conductance was 'mound-like' or 'valley-like'.\n\nShot noise and transmission were measured as function of the excitation voltage Vsd and splitgate voltage Vg, for bulk filling factors v=5/2, v=7/3 and v=1/3; with tunnelling charge deduced\nfrom Eq. 1. In the weak and strong backscattering regimes, in all three filling factors, both g and\nSi(Vsd,0) exhibited two distinct regions in the excitation voltage at ~10mK. At low excitation\nvoltage a 'non linear characteristic' with voltage dependent g, was obtained, accompanied with a\nlarge slope in Si(Vsd,0), which corresponds to a large charge. At higher excitation voltage a\nrather 'linear characteristic' and a significantly lower charge were obtained (see for example\nFigs. 1c & 1d, measured at bulk filling factor v=5/2).\n\nFocusing on the range of low excitation voltage an interesting dependence of the deduced\ntunnelling charge on the average transmission probability was found.\n\nAt v=5/2, at high -\n\n'mound-like' - transmission (t~0.9), the tunneling (backscattered) charge was substantially\nhigher than the theoretically predicted fundamental quasiparticle charge e*=e/4 (Fig. 1c & 2a).\nAt intermediate values of the transmission probability (t~0.4-0.9), with the conductance almost\nindependent of excitation voltage, the tunnelling charge was very close to e*=e/4 (Fig. 2b). At\nlower - 'valley-like' - transmission, the tunnelling charge increased towards e*=e (Fig. 2c).\nWhile the latter result is expected, since the filling factor within the constriction approaches v=2,\nthus enabling only tunneling of electrons, the high transmission results were not expected.\nFigure 2d summaries the tunnelling charge evolution as function of the average transmission\n\n6\n\n\ft5/2\u22122 , as measured with four different samples, in the low excitation voltage regime. A\n\nsimilar dependence of the tunnelling charge was also obtained at bulk filling factor v=7/3, as\nmeasured with sample #1. Two examples are shown in Figs. 3a & 3b (the somewhat higher\nexcitation voltage was due to the very small excitation current \u2013 only 1/7 of the total current carried by the 7/3 channel). The evolution of the tunnelling charge as function of t7/3\u22122 shown\nin Fig. 3c, resembling that for v=5/2, with e*~e/3 obtained only at intermediate transmissions where the transmission is nearly independent of excitation voltage.\n\nFor the v=1/3 state, we present only two examples of noise measurements, performed in the high\nrange of the transmission t1/3 with 'mound-like' and flat dependence (sample #5). A bimodal\ntunnelling charge is observed in Fig. 4a for a 'mound-like' transmission, with e*=e in the small\nexcitation voltage range and e*~e/3 at higher excitation voltages. At a somewhat lower, but a\nrather voltage independent transmission, the tunnelling charge fits well e*=e/3 over a wide range\nof excitation voltage (Fig. 4b). In the range of lower transmission (t1/3<0.3, not shown here),\nwhich had been already explored by Griffiths et al. [25], the backscattered charge approached e as expected for quasiparticles traversing a rather opaque barrier.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the shot noise for high transmission at bulk filling factor v=5/2 is\nshown in Fig. 5. The mixing chamber was heated (via a resistor) in the range 10-85mK, with the\nelectron temperature monitored via the thermal noise, S(0)T=4kBTg. With an open constriction,\nthe longitudinal resistance increased weakly with temperature, however the backscattering\nthrough the bulk was less than 0.1% even at 85mK. This backscattered current was shot noise\nfree, and thus was subtracted from the impinging excitation current. Since the shot noise was\n\n7\n\n\fsubstantially lower at the elevated temperatures, the range of the excitation voltage was extended\nVsd=0-50\u03bcV. As evident from Figs. 5a & 5b the differential transmission coefficient was fairly\nconstant with the excitation voltage and the quasiparticle charge diminished. The tunnelling\ncharge approached e*=e/4 as the temperature reached ~75mK and saturated thereafter (Fig. 5c).\n\nOur shot noise measurements demonstrate that the tunnelling charge through a narrow\nconstriction - that serves to partition the incoming current - is not unique and depends on the\nspecific details of the tunneling barrier and the energetics. In our experiments the low energy\ncharge (yet with eV>>kBT) presented a rather complex evolution moving between two extreme\nvalues. A smaller value - being close to the theoretically expected fundamental charge \u2013 is\nmeasured at intermediate backscattering probabilities (or at higher excitation voltage or\ntemperature), in which the transmission is either constant or exhibits a weak \"valley-like\"\nbehavior. A larger charge, approaching e, for extremely weak backscattering and measured in\nthe limit of low excitation voltage and temperature. Here the transmission is found to exhibit a\n\"mound-like\" behavior \u2013 in contradiction to the CLL prediction. The enhancement of the charge\ncan be attributed to backscattering of a mixture of integer multiples of the fundamental charge\n('bunching'). This assumption is strengthened by the observation of the lower measured charge\nat higher excitation voltage or temperature, which can be attributed to the dissemination of the\nhigher charge into individual fundamental charges. This hypothesis finds support from the\nexpectation that in states belonging to the Jain's series, namely, \u03bd=p/(2np+1), with n and p\nintegers, and in the presence of multiple edge channels, weak backscattering of bunched\nquasiparticles dominates at low temperatures [33, 34] (although the fractions v=5/2, v=7/3 and\nv=1/3 were not addressed). A similar larger charge is also measured when the backscattering of\n\n8\n\n\fthe relevant edge channel is strong. However, bunching in this limit is theoretically expected\n[28]. Our findings are not only theoretically intriguing but have implications on a variety of\nproposed experiments, such as proposed interference experiments designed to test the statistical\nnature of quasiparticles [35-38], as they rely on weak backscattering of quasiparticles.

Excitation DC current is driven via the\nsource S, provided by a DC voltage V and a large resistor in series. The AC voltage v is used to\nmeasure the two-terminal differential conductance. Drain voltage fluctuations (at D) is filtered\nwith a LC resonant circuit, tuned to 910 kHz, amplified by a cooled preamplifier (A) attached to\nthe 4.2K stage. The split-gate, controlled by voltage Vg, was tuned for the desired transmission\nprobability. (c), (d) Measurements of shot noise and the corresponding different transmission\nt5/2-2 at T=12mK, for a large range of excitation voltage.\n\nFigure 2: Measurements at \u03bd=5/2 state of the transmission probability and the shot noise in the\nsmall Vsd range, measured at T~10mK. (a) - (c) Spectral density for a few transmissions and the\npredicted spectral density for different partitioned quasiparticle charges (using Eq. 1). (d) The\nevolution of quasiparticle charge as a function of the average transmission probability t5/2\u2212 2\n\n,\n\nmeasured on four different samples.\n\nFigure 3: Transmission coefficients and spectral density at \u03bd=7/3 state. (a), (b) The measured\nspectral density at two different transmission coefficients, and the predicted spectral density for\ndifferent quasiparticle charges (using Eq. 1). (c) Backscattered charge as a function of the\naverage transmission t7/3\u2212 2 at \u03bd=7/3 and T=12mK.\n\n11\n\n\fFigure 4: Transmission coefficient and spectral density at \u03bd=1/3 state. (a), (b) One-side spectral\ndensity at \u03bd=1/3 and T=10mK. The expected spectral density for charge e*=e and e*=e/3 is\nplotted (solid lines using Eq. 2) on top of the data. The 'mound-like' behavior of the transmission\nis associated with the enhanced partitioned charge in the low impinging current range and a\nsmaller charge, close to e*=e/3, in the high current range. A 'flat' transmission coefficient, as in\n(b) results in e*=e/3 in the full range of the excitation voltage (or impinging current).\n\nFigure 5: The dependence of the backscattered charge on temperature measured at weak\nbackscattering in the \u03bd=5/2 state. Two examples of the measured data: (a) at T=46mK with\ne*~0.5e, and (b) at T=76mK with e*~e/4. (c) Evolution of the backscattered charge as a function\nof temperature. At temperatures higher than ~40mK a significant reduction of the charge is\nobserved.\n\n12\n\n\fb\n\na\nT=12mK\n\n(a)\n\n10\n8\n\nR\n\nxx\n\n(k\u03a9)\n\n0.3\n0.1\n\n\u03bd=3\n\nS\n\n\u03bd=5/2\n\u03bd=2\n\u03bd=8/3\n\u03bd=7/3\n\u03bd=14/5\n\u03bd=11/5\n4.5\n5\n5.5\nmagnetic field, B (T)\n\n2\nVg\n\n1GW\n\n1MW\n\nV\n\nv\n\nA\nL\n\nC\n\n6\n\nd 1\n5/2-2\n\nc 1\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nt\n\nt\n\n5/2-2\n\n5 mm\n\nsplit gate\n\n0\n\n0\n\n8\n\nspectral density\nSi x 10-30 (A2/Hz)\n\nSi x 10-30 (A2/Hz)\n\n0\nspectral density\n\nVg\n\n1\n\nR\n\nxy\n\n(k\u03a9)\n\n12\n\n6\ne*=0.8 e\n\n4\n*\n\n2 e =0.15e\n0\n-100 -50\n0\n50\n100\nexcitation voltage, V (\u03bcV)\n\n30\n\ne*=0.625 e\n\n20\ne*=0.16e\n\n10\n0\n-100 -50\n0\n50\n-100\nexcitation voltage, V (\u03bcV)\n\nsd\n\nsd\n\nFigure 1\n\n13\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n(b)\n\n0.5\n\n(c)\n\n0.5\n\nt\n\n5/2-2\n\n(a)\n\nspectral density\nSi x 10-30 (A2/Hz)\n\n0\n4\n\n0\ne*=0.8 e\n\ne =0.29e\ne*=0.5 e\n\n10\n\ne*=0.25 e\n\n3\n\n0\n15\n\n*\n\ne*=0.73 e\n\n10\n\n2\n\n5\n\n1\n-20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nexcitation voltage, V\n\nsd\n\ne*=0.25 e\n\n20 -20 -10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n(\u03bcV)\n\n1.2\nquasiparticle charge, e* (e)\n\n(d) T~10mK\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n\nsample 1\nsample 2\nsample 3\nsample 4\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\naverage transmission, \u3008t\n\n\u3009\n5/2-2\n\nFigure 2\n\n14\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n\f7/3-2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nt\n\n1\n\nspectral density\nSi x 10-30 (A2/Hz)\n\n0\n10\n\n(a)\n\nT=10mK\n\n0\n15\n\n(b)\n\nT=10mK\ne*=0.66 e\n\ne*=0.68e\n\ne*=0.4e\n\n10\n5\n5\n0\n\n0\n\ne*=0.33 e\n\n-30 -15 0\n\n15 30\n-30 -15 0\nexcitation voltage, V (\u03bcV)\n\n15 30\n\nsd\n\n1\nquasiparticle charge, e* (e)\n\n(c) T~10mK\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\naverage transmission, \u3008t\n\n0.8\n\n\u3009\n7/3-2\n\nFigure 3\n\n15\n\n1\n\n\f1/3\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nspectral density\n\nSi x 10-30 (A2/Hz)\n\nt\n\n1\n\n0\n8\n\n(a)\n\nT~10mK\n\n0\n\nT~10mK\n\n(b)\n\n6\n*\n\n6 e =e\n4\n\n4\ne*=e/3\n\n2\n0\n0\n\n10\n\ne*=e/3\n\n2\n\n0\n20 30\n40 0\n10 20\nexcitation voltage, V (\u03bcV)\nsd\n\nFigure 4\n\n16\n\n30\n\n40\n\n\f5/2-2\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nt\n\n1\n\nspectral density\ni\n-30\n2\nS x 10 (A /Hz)\n\n0\n10\n\n(b) T=76mK\n\n(a) T=46mK\n\n0\n\ne*=0.75e\n\n6\n\n*\n\ne =0.5e\n\ne*=0.25 e\ne*=0.5e\n\n4\n\n5\n\n2\n0\ne*=0.25e\n\n-50\n\n0\n\n50\n\n0\n-50\n\n-0\n\nexcitation voltage, Vsd (\u03bcV)\n\n50\n\n1.2\nquasiparticle charge e* (e)\n\n(c)\n\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\n80\nelectron temperature, T (mK)\n\nFigure 5\n\n17\n\n100\n\n\f"}
