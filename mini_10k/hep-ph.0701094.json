Introduction\n\nThe Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a remarkably successful theory. It provides a complete description of physics at currently accessible energy, and its predictions have\nbeen confirmed to high accuracy by the high energy experiments. However, the mechanism of\nelectroweak symmetry breaking(EWSB) remains unknown. Furthermore, in the SM, the Higgs\nmass receives quadratically divergent quantum corrections which have to be cancelled by some\nnew physics(NP) to avoid fine-tuning. The SM Higgs sector is therefore an effective theory\nbelow some cut-off scale \u039b. To avoid fine-tuning of Higgs mass, one would require the NP\nscale \u039b to be \u223c TeV. Various NP models were proposed at the TeV scale, which can cancel\nthe quadratic divergences of the SM Higgs. Recently, a new theory, dubbed the little Higgs\ntheory[1], has drawn a lot of interests as a new candidate for solution of the problems mentioned\nabove.\nSo far, a number of specific little Higgs models [2, 3, 4, 5] have been proposed. The generic\nstructure of these models is that a global symmetry is broken at the scale f which is around a\nTeV. At the scale f there are new gauge bosons, scalars, fermions responsible for canceling the\none loop quadratic divergences to the Higgs mass from the SM particles. The new particles\npredicted by the little Higgs models will emerge characteristic signatures at the present or\nfuture high energy collider experiments[6]. Furthermore, among the various little Higgs models,\nthe most economical and phenomenologically viable model is the littlest Higgs model[5] which\nrealizes the little Higgs idea and has all essential features of the little Higgs models. Such model\nconsists of a nonlinear \u03c3 model with a global SU(5) symmetry which is broken down to SO(5)\nby a vacuum expectation value (vev) of order f \u223c \u039bs /4\u03c0 \u223c TeV. At the same time, the gauge\n\nsubgroup [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 is broken to its diagonal subgroup SU(2) \u00d7 U(1), identified as the\n\nSM electroweak gauge group. This breaking scenario gives rise to four massive gauge bosons\n(BH , ZH , WH\u00b1 ). Thus, studying the possible signatures of the new gauge bosons and their\ncontribution to some processes at high-energy colliders is a good method to test the littlest\nHiggs model and furthermore to probe the EWSB mechanism. However, in the littlest Higgs\nmodel, the masses of these new heavy gauge bosons are in the range of a few TeV, except for\nthe mass of BH in the range of hundreds GeV. In fact, the gauge boson BH is the lightest new\nparticle in the littlest Higgs model so that it should be the first signal at future experiments\n\n2\n\n\fand would play the most important role in probing the littlest Higgs model.\nIt is well known that the LHC can directly probe the possible NP beyond the SM up\nto a few TeV. If the new particles or interactions will be directly discovered at the future\nhadron collider experiments, the linear e+ e\u2212 collider(LC) will then play a crucial role in the\ndetailed and thorough study of these new phenomena and in the reconstruction of the underlying\nfundamental theories. In addition e+ e\u2212 physics, the future LC provides a unique opportunity\nto study \u03b3\u03b3 and e\u03b3 interactions at high energy and luminosity comparable to those in e+ e\u2212\ncollisions[7]. High energy photons for \u03b3\u03b3, e\u03b3 collisions(Photon Collider) can be obtained using\nCompton backscattering of laster light off the high energy electrons. Such possibilities will\nbe realized at the International Linear Collider(ILC), with the center of mass(c.m.) energy\n\u221a\ns=300 GeV-1.5 TeV and the yearly luminosity 500 f b\u22121 [8]. The physics potential of the\nPhoton Collider is very rich and complements the physics program of the e+ e\u2212 mode. The\nPhoton Collider will considerably contribute to the detailed understanding of new phenomena,\nand in some scenarios it is the best instrument for the discovery of elements of NP. In particular,\nthe e\u2212 \u03b3 collision can produce particles which are kinematically not accessible at e+ e\u2212 collisions\nat the same collider[7, 9]. Moreover, the high energy photon polarization can vary relatively\neasily, which is advantageous for experiments. All the virtues of the Photon Collider will provide\nus with a good chance to pursue NP particles, specially the lightest new gauge boson BH which\nshould be kinematically accessible at the planned ILC. Some BH production processes have been\nstudied at the Photon Collider[10, 11]. In the reference[10], we have studied a process of the BH\nproduction associated with W boson pair via photon-photon collision, i.e., \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 W + W \u2212 BH .\nSuch process would offer a good chance to probe the BH signal and to study the triple and\nquartic gauge couplings involving BH and the SM gauge bosons which shed important light on\nthe symmetry breaking features of the littlest Higgs model. Via e\u03b3 collision, a single heavy new\ngauge boson in the littlest Higgs model can also be produced at the TeV energy colliders[11].\nWe find that there exist another important BH production processes via e\u03b3 collision at the ILC,\ni.e., e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH and e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZBH . In this paper, we study the possibility of detecting the\nBH via these processes and complement the probe of the littlest Higgs model.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we briefly review the littlest Higgs model.\nThe Sec. III presents the calculations of the production cross sections of the processes. The\nnumerical results and conclusions will be shown in Sec. IV.\n\n3\n\n\fII. The littlest Higgs model\n\nIn this section we describe the main idea of littlest Higgs model[5] and the detailed review\nof this model can be found in refrence[6]. Furthermore, the phenomenology of this model was\nalso discussed in great detail in precision tests and low energy measurements[12, 13, 14, 15].\nThe littlest Higgs model embeds the electroweak sector of the SM in an SU(5)/SO(5) nonlinear sigma model. The breaking of the global SU(5) symmetry to an SO(5) subgroup at the\nscale \u039bs \u223c 4\u03c0f by a vev of order f, results in 14 Goldstone bosons, which are denoted by \u03a0a (x).\nWe can conveniently parameterize the Goldstone bosons by the non-linear sigma model field\n\u03a3(x) = ei\u03a0/f \u03a30 ei\u03a0\n\nT /f\n\nP14\n\nwhere f is decay constant, and \u03a0(x) =\n\na=1\n\n= e2i\u03a0/f \u03a30 ,\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a0a (x)X a . The sum runs over the 14 broken\n\nSU(5) generators X a and here we have used the relation X a \u03a30 = \u03a30 X aT , obeyed by the broken\ngenerators, in the last step.\nThe leading order dimension-two term in the non-linear sigma model can be written for the\nscalar sector as\nL\u03a3 =\n\nf2\nT r|D\u03bc \u03a3|2 ,\n8\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the covariant derivative is\nD\u03bc \u03a3 = \u2202\u03bc \u03a3 \u2212 i\n\n2\nX\n\nT\nT\n[gj (W\u03bcj \u03a3 + \u03a3W\u03bcj\n) + gj\u2032 (B\u03bcj \u03a3 + \u03a3B\u03bcj\n)].\n\n(3)\n\nj=1\n\nW\u03bcj , B\u03bcj are the SU(2)j and U(1)j gauge fields, respectively and gj , gj\u2032 are the corresponding\ncoupling constants.\nFurthermore, the vev breaks the gauge subgroup [SU(2) \u00d7 U(1)]2 of the SU(5) down to\nthe diagonal group SU(2) \u00d7 U(1), identified as the SM electroweak group. So four of fourteen\nGoldstone bosons are eaten to give mass to four particular linear combinations of the gauge\nfields\nW = sW1 + cW2 ,\nB = s\u2032 B1 + c\u2032 B2 ,\n\nW \u2032 = \u2212cW1 + sW2 ,\n\n(4)\n\nB \u2032 = \u2212c\u2032 B1 + s\u2032 B2 ,\n\nwith the mixing angle\ng2\ns \u2261 sin\u03c8 = q\n,\ng12 + g22\n\ng1\nc \u2261 cos\u03c8 = q\n,\ng12 + g22\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fg\u2032\n,\ns\u2032 \u2261 sin\u03c8 \u2032 = q 2\ng1\u20322 + g2\u20322\n\ng\u2032\nc\u2032 \u2261 cos\u03c8 \u2032 = q 1\n.\ng1\u20322 + g2\u20322\n\nThese couplings can be related to the SM couplings (g, g \u2032) by\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n,\n2\ng2\ng1 g22\n\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n.\n\u20322\ng \u20322\ng1\ng2\u20322\n\n(6)\n\nAt the scale f , the SM gauge bosons W and B remain massless while the heavy gauge bosons\nacquire masses of order f\nmW \u2032 =\nThe presence of\n\n\u221a\n\ng\nf,\n2sc\n\ng\u2032\nmB\u2032 = \u221a \u2032 \u2032 f\n2 5s c\n\n(7)\n\n5 in the denominator of mB\u2032 leads to a relatively light new neutral gauge\n\nboson.\nThe Higgs boson at tree level remains massless as a Goldtone boson, but its mass is radiatively generated because any nonlinearly realized symmetry is broken by the gauge, Yukawa,\nand self-interactions of the Higgs field. The little Higgs model introduces a collective symmetry breaking: Only when multiple gauge symmetries are broken is the Higgs mass radiatively\ngenerated; the loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass occur at least at the two-loop level.\nThe one-loop quadratic divergence induced by the SM particles is canceled by that induced by\nthe new particles due to the exactly opposite couplings. For example, at leading order in 1/f ,\nthe couplings of H field to the gauge bosons following from Eq.(2) are given as\n1\na\nH(g1 g2 W1\u03bca W2\u03bc\n+ g1\u2032 g2\u2032 B1\u03bc B2\u03bc )H + + ...\n4\n1\nH[g 2 (W\u03bca W \u03bca \u2212 W\u03bc\u2032a W \u2032\u03bca ) \u2212 g \u20322 (B\u03bc B \u03bc \u2212 B\u03bc\u2032 B \u2032\u03bc )]H + + ... .\n=\n4\n\nL =\n\n(8)\n\nIt is to be compared with SUSY models where the cancellation occurs due to the different spin\nstatistics between the SM particle and its superparter.\nIn order to cancel the severe quadratic divergence from the top quark loop, another topquark-like fermion is also required. In addition, this new fermion is naturally expected to\nbe heavy with mass of order f. As a minimal extension, a vectorlike fermion pair t\u0303 and t\u0303\u2032c\nwith the SM quantum numbers (3, 1)Yi and (3\u0304, 1)\u2212Yi are introduced. With \u03c7i = (b3 , t3 , t\u0303) and\nantisymmetric tensors \u01ebijk and \u01ebxy , the coupling of the SM top quark to the pseudo-Goldstone\nbosons and the heavy vector pair in the littlest Higgs model is chosen to be\n1\n\u03bb1 f \u01ebijk \u01ebxy \u03c7i \u03a3jx \u03a3ky u\u2032c3 + \u03bb2 f t\u0303t \u0303\u2032c + h.c.\n2\n\u221a\ni\n= \u2212i\u03bb1 ( 2h0 t3 + if t\u0303 \u2212 h0 h0\u2217 t\u0303)u\u2032c3 + h.c. + ... .\nf\n\nL =\n\n5\n\n(9)\n\n\fAs it is shown in the above equation, the quadratic divergence from the top quark is canceled by\nthat from the new heavy top-quark-like fermion. In addition, the cancellation is stable against\nradiative corrections.\nThe EWSB is induced by the remaining Goldstone bosons H and \u03c6. Through radiative\ncorrections, the gauge, the Yukawa, and self-interactions of the Higgs field generate a Higgs\npotential which triggers the EWSB. Now the SM W and Z bosons acquire masses of order v,\nand small (of order v 2 /f 2 ) mixing between the heavy gauge bosons and the SM gauge bosons\nW and Z occurs. The masses of the SM gauge bosons W and Z and their couplings to the SM\nparticles are modified from those in the SM at the order of v 2 /f 2 . In the following, we denote\nthe mass eigenstates of SM gauge fields by WL\u00b1 , ZL and AL and the new heavy gauge bosons\nby WH\u00b1 , ZH and BH .

Global fits to the\nexperimental data put rather severe constrains on the f > 4 TeV at 95% C.L. [17]. However,\ntheir analyses are based on a simple assumption that the SM fermions are charged only under\nU(1)1 . If the SM fermions are charged under U(1)1 \u00d7 U(1)2 , the bounds become relaxed. The\nscale parameter f = 1 \u223c 2 TeV is allowed for the mixing parameters c and c\u2032 in the range of\n0 \u223c 0.5 and 0.62 \u223c 0.73, respectively[18].\nIII.

The U(1) hypercharge of electron,\n\nye , can be fixed by requiring that the U(1) charge assignments is anomaly free, i.e., ye = 35 .\nThis is only one example among several alternatives for the U(1) charge choice[12].\nWith the above couplings, BH can be produced associated with a \u03b3 or Z boson via e\u2212 \u03b3 collision. At the tree-level, the relevant Feynman diagrams for the processes e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH , e\u2212 ZBH\nin the littlest model are shown in Figs.1(a-f).

The numerical results and conclusions\n\nTo obtain numerical results, we take MZ = 91.187 GeV, v = 246 GeV, s2W = 0.23. The\nelectromagnetic fine structure constant \u03b1e at certain energy scale is calculated from the simple\nQED one-loop evolution formula with the boundary value \u03b1e = 1/137.04 [21]. There are four\n\u221a\nfree parameters in our numerical estimations, i.e., f, c, c\u2032 , s. Here, we take the parameter\nspace (f = 1 \u223c 2 TeV, c = 0 \u2212 0.5, c\u2032 = 0.62 \u2212 0.73) which is consistent with the electroweak\nprecision data.

The cross sections mainly\ndepend on the mixing parameter c\u2032 . So in Fig.2 we plot the cross sections as a function of\n\u221a\nthe parameter c\u2032 , taking s = 0.8 TeV and f=1 TeV(2 TeV) as the examples. From Fig.2,\none can see that the cross sections drop sharply to zero when c\u2032 equals\n\nq\n\n2/5. This is because\n\nthe coupling of the gauge boson BH to the electron pair become decoupled with c\u2032 =\nWhen c\u2032 is over\n\nq\n\nq\n\n2/5.\n\n2/5, the cross sections increase with c\u2032 and the cross section of the process\n\ne\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH can reach the level of tens fb even a hundred fb. But the cross section of the\nprocess e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZBH is much smaller than that of e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH and its maximum can only\nreach the level of 1 fb. So the process e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH should have advantage in probing BH .\nOn the other hand, comparing the results for f=1 TeV with those for f=2 TeV, we find that\nthe cross sections decrease slightly with f increasing.

Considering the c.m. energy at\nthe ILC and the kinetic limit, we present the numerical results for energies ranging from 0.5 to\n1.5 TeV. The results show that the cross section of e\u2212 \u03b3BH production slightly decreases with\n\u221a\n\u221a\ns and the cross section of e\u2212 ZBH production is more insensitive to s.\nThe yearly luminosity of the ILC can reach 500f b\u22121 . So we can conclude that the sufficient\ntypical BH events can be produced via e\u03b3 collision, specially via the process e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH .\nBut to detect BH , one also needs to study the decay modes of BH which has been done in\nreference[12]. The decay width of a particle affects how and to what extent it is experimentally\ndetectable, since production of particles with very large decay widths may be difficult to distinguish from background processes. For BH , the parameter spaces where the large decay width\nwould occur are beyond current search limits in any case. So if BH would be produced it can\nbe detected via the measurement of the peak in the invariant mass distribution of its decaying\n11\n\n\fparticles. On the other hand, for the process e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH , the backgrounds are likely to be\nmore larger in the collision direction because it is difficult to distinguish the final state e\u2212 \u03b3\nfrom the injecting e\u2212 \u03b3. But the backgrounds can be significantly depressed if the detection is\ntaken in the direction of deviating the collision.\nIn the following, we focus on discussing how to detect BH via its decay modes. The main\ndecay modes of BH are e+ e\u2212 + \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 + \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 , dd \u0304 + ss\u0304, u\u016b + cc\u0304, ZH, W + W \u2212 . The decay\nbranching ratios of these modes have been studied in reference[12] which are strongly dependent\non the U(1) charge assignments of the SM fermions. In general, the heavy gauge bosons are\nlikely to be discovered via their decays modes to leptons. For BH , the most interesting decay\nmodes should be e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 . This is because such leptons can be easily identified and the\nnumber of e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 background events with such a high invariant mass is very small. So,\nthe measurement of the peak in the invariant mass distribution of e+ e\u2212 , \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 can provide\na unique way to probe BH . For the signal e\u2212 \u03b3e+ e\u2212 (\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), the main SM background arises\n\u221a\nfrom e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3Z with Z \u2192 e+ e\u2212 (\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ). The cross section is a few pb with s =0.5 \u223c\n\n1.5 TeV [22]. For the signal e\u2212 Ze+ e\u2212 (\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 ), the most serious SM backgrounds come from\nthe processes e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZZ, e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZH and their cross sections can reach about 10 fb, a\n\u221a\nfew fb, respectively, in the energy range s = 0.5 \u223c 1.5 TeV[23]. But one can very easily\n\ndistinguish BH from Z via their significantly different e+ e\u2212 (\u03bc\u03bc) invariant mass distribution.\n\nThe backgrounds of e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZH with H decaying to lepton pair or light quark pair are very\nsmall because the decay branching ratios of these H decay modes are depressed by the small\nmasses of leptons and light quarks. On the other hand, we can also distinguish BH from H via\ntheir different invariant mass distribution of final particles because BH is much heavier than\nH. As we know, in a narrow region around c\u2032 = 0.63, the decay branching ratios of BH \u2192 l+ l\u2212\napproach zero due to the decoupling of BH with lepton pair. In this case, the main decay\nmodes of BH are BH \u2192 W + W \u2212 , ZH. The decay mode Z \u2192 W + W \u2212 is of course kinematically\n\nforbidden in the SM but H \u2192 W + W \u2212 is the dominant decay mode with Higgs mass above\n135 GeV(one or both of W is off-shell for Higgs mass below 2MW ). So the background for the\nsignal e\u2212 ZW + W \u2212 might be serious and it is hard to detect the BH via e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZBH with\nBH \u2192 W + W \u2212 . However, the process e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH does not suffer such large background\n\nproblem which would be another advantage of e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH . For BH \u2192 ZH, the main\nfinal states are l+ l\u2212 bb\u0304. In this case, two b-jets can be reconstructed to the Higgs mass and\n\n12\n\n\fa l+ l\u2212 can be reconstructed to the Z mass and the background is very clean. Furthermore,\nthe decay mode ZH involves the off-diagonal coupling HZBH and the factor cot2\u03c8 \u2032 in the\ncoupling HZBH is a unique feature of the littlest Higgs model. It should also be mentioned\nthat experimental precision measurement of such off-diagonal coupling is more easier than that\nof diagonal coupling. So, the decay mode ZH would not only provide a better way to probe\nBH but also provide a robust test of the littlest Higgs model.\nIn conclusion, the realization of e\u03b3 or \u03b3\u03b3 collision at the planed ILC with high energy\nand luminosity will provide more chances to probe the new particles predicted by the new\nphysics beyond the SM. In this paper, we study the new gauge boson BH production processes\nvia e\u03b3 collision, i.e., e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH , e\u2212 ZBH . The study shows that the cross section of\ne\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 ZBH can reach the level of less than one fb in most parameter spaces while the cross\nsection of the process e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH can reach the level of tens fb and even hundreds of fb in\nmost parameter spaces allowed by the electroweak precision data. We can predict that there\nare enough BH signals can be produced via these processes, specially via e\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH at\nthe planned ILC. Because the new gauge boson BH can be easily distinguished from the SM Z\nand H, the signal would be typical and the background would be very clean. So, the processes\ne\u2212 \u03b3 \u2192 e\u2212 \u03b3BH , e\u2212 ZBH will provide a good chance to probe BH and test the littlest Higgs\nmodel.\n\n13\n\n\fReferences\n[1] For a recent review see: M.
