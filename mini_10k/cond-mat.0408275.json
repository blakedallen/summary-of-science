INTRODUCTION\nIn the past several years, there has been a revival of interest in studying high\ndielectric constant materials because of their potential applications in a variety of\ndevices, such as static and dynamic random access memories. Recently, a\nbody-centered cubic perovskite-related CaCu3Ti4O12 (CCTO) compound was reported\nto posses an extraordinarily high static dielectric constant at room temperature with\n\u03b5r\u2248 105,1-9 which is practically frequency independent between DC and 106 Hz for the\ntemperature range between 100K and 600K. However, the dielectric constant displays\na 1000-fold reduction below 100 K without any detectable change of structural phase\ntransition, as demonstrated by neutron powder diffraction2 and high resolution X-ray\ndiffraction.3 Moreover, as demanded by miniaturization of microelectronic devices,\nthin-film form of this materials has been prepared by several groups,10-14 which\npromote not only high expectation of device applications but also challenge for better\nunderstanding of their rich physical phenomena.\nAlthough there are many reports on the CCTO, the origin of its high dielectric\nconstant is still not well understood. Several intrinsic physical interpretations have\nbeen given, examples include a relaxor-like slowing down of dipolar fluctuations in\nnanosize domains,1 and highly polarizable relaxation modes.3 However, without the\nchange of crystal structure, the above mentioned effects have been questioned and\nsome extrinsic effects have been put forth,15 such as point or line defects16 or Schottky\nbarriers at the interface between sample and the electrodes.8 M. A. Subramanian et\nal.2,9 demonstrated that the single crystal of CCTO was highly twinned, and the twin\nboundaries might then be acting in a manner to create a barrier layer capacitance,\nthereby enhancing the dielectric constants. Such explanations were also proposed in\nthe epitaxial CCTO thin films on oxide substrates.9-11 D. C. Sinclair et al.4,17 pointed\nout that, with the help of impedance spectroscopy, the insulating grain boundaries on\nCCTO ceramics separated semiconducting grains and they suggested that the high\ndielectric constant phenomenon was an extrinsic effect that was due to the barrier\nlayer capacitors (BLC) effects.18 However, as pointed by the authors, the origin of the\nsemiconductivity in the grains is still to be established. In addition, there have been\n2\n\n\ffew reports on the detailed mechanism behind the characteristics of high dielectric\nconstant in polycrystalline CCTO films.\nIn a recent work, we reported the successful deposition of CCTO thin films with\nhigh dielectric constant on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si substrates by pulsed laser deposition\n(PLD),12 and it was found that the dielectric properties of the CCTO films were very\nsensitive to the post-annealing atmosphere and temperature.19 However, it is not clear\nwhy the post-annealing can result in such a dramatically change of the dielectric\nproperties. In this study, impedance spectroscopy (IS), which is a flexible\nexperimental technique to obtain information about the electrical microstructure of\nmaterials,20,21 was applied to measure the electrical parameters of the as-deposited and\npost-annealed polycrystalline CCTO films. The simple resistor-capacitor (RC)\nequivalent circuit and the modified constant phase element (CPE) circuit were used to\ninterpret the experiment results. Our results provide direct evidence leading to the\nconclusion that the origin of the high dielectric constant in the polycrystalline CCTO\nthin films is due to the BLC mechanism. More importantly, the origin of the\nsemiconductivity in the grains is demonstrated to be due to their oxygen-loss, while\nthe insulating nature of grain boundaries is due to their oxygen-stoichiometry.\n\nII. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE\nThe CCTO thin films of 480 nm in thickness were grown on Pt/Ti/SiO2/Si\nsubstrates by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) using a stoichiometry ceramic target. As\nreported elsewhere,12 the CCTO thin films show the polycrystalline nature and have\npreferential orientation in (220). The film surface is crack-free and smooth, and is\ncomposed of uniformly distributed rectangular shaped grains. To measure the\ndielectric properties, the Pt top electrode with diameter of 0.25 mm were deposited by\nsputtering through a shadow mask, forming parallel-plate capacitors with bottom\nelectrode. After deposition of the top electrodes, the films were given different\npost-annealing treatments in a tube furnace as described in Table I. The dielectric\nproperties and IS measurements were carried out at room temperature after each\npost-annealing using a HP4294A impedance analyzer at 100 mV over the frequency\n3\n\n\frange of 40 Hz to 10 MHz.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISSCUSIONS\nFigure 1 shows the variations of the dielectric constant and dielectric loss as a\nfunction of frequency for films annealed in N2 and O2 atmospheres at different\ntemperature for 8 h. The as-deposited capacitors show good dielectric properties,\nwhere the dielectric constant and dielectric loss values at 100 kHz were approximately\n2300 and 0.085, respectively, which are comparable with those obtained in the\nepitaxial CCTO films grown on oxides substrate.11 The dielectric behavior of the\nPt/CCTO/Pt capacitors was very sensitive to the post-annealing atmosphere and\ntemperature. Films annealed at 200 oC in nitrogen and oxygen showed no significant\nchanges in the dielectric properties. However, capacitors with nitrogen post-annealed\nat 400 oC presented strong dielectric relaxation at low frequencies (102 Hz-104 Hz),\nwhile the subsequent oxygen post-annealing diminished the low frequency dielectric\nrelaxation effect. When the capacitors were again post-annealed in nitrogen at 550 oC,\nthe phenomenon of a larger dielectric relaxation was once more observed, while the\noxygen atmosphere annealing reduced the relaxation but caused a steady fall in the\ndielectric constant.\nFig. 2 shows typical impedance spectra for the as-deposited and annealed CCTO\nthin films corresponding to Fig.1. The as-deposited CCTO thin films contain a large\narc (hollow curves) with nonzero intercept at high frequencies in impedance complex\nplane plots, which suggests that the CCTO thin films is electrical inhomogeneous.\nThe impedance data could be modeled using an equivalent circuit based on two\nparallel (resistor R, and capacitor C) elements connected in series. Similar to the bulk\nceramic case,4,17 the nonzero intercept indicates the presence of an arc for frequency\nhigher than the maximum frequency measured (107 Hz), which is assigned as the\ncontribution from grain interior, while the large semicircular arc at low frequencies is\noriginated from the grain boundaries. The resistances of the grains and grain\nboundaries can be estimated from the intersects of the curves with the real part of the\nimpedance Z' axis as 20 \u03a9 [inset of Fig. 2 (a)] and 44 k\u03a9 [ Fig. 2 (a)], which\n4\n\n\fcorresponds to the resistivities of 204 \u03a9 cm and 450 k\u03a9 cm, respectively. It can be\nnoted that the values of resistivity are very close to those of the CCTO ceramic.4 Thus,\nthe room temperature IS data indicate that the polycrystalline CCTO thin films consist\nof insulating grain boundaries with semiconducting grains, and therefore, the high\ndielectric constant can be ascribed to the BLC mechanism.\nThe Z*- plots for the CCTO thin films annealed at different stages show that the\nresistances of the grains and grain boundaries are very sensitive to the annealing\natmosphere and temperature. When the films were annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at\n200 oC, the resistance of the grains remained constant, while the resistance of the\ngrain boundaries decreased from 44 k\u03a9 to 14 k\u03a9. When the films were subsequently\nannealed in oxygen atmosphere at 200 oC, no obvious change was observed in the\nresistance of the grains, but the resistance of the grain boundaries increased. Similar\nbehavior was also found in higher annealing temperatures, the resistance of the grain\nboundaries decreased in nitrogen atmosphere, will regain the resistence when the\nfilms were again post-annealing in oxygen atmosphere. Moreover, when the films\nwere annealed in oxygen atmosphere at 400 oC, the resistance of the grains increased\nto 125 \u03a9 and could be restored as before when the films subsequently annealed at 550\no\n\nC in nitrogen. Most important, when the films were annealed at 550 oC in oxygen, we\n\nfound that the impendence data for the CCTO thin films only took the form of a single\narc with the resistance value of 660 k\u03a9. At high frequencies (close to 10 MHz) the arc\nintersects with the Z\" axis at a non-zero value. We assume that this arc was originated\nfrom the grain components, which could be checked by the fitting results discussed\nbelow. In addition, several points of the arc at low frequencies was observed, this was\nattributed to the grain boundaries.\nObviously, the resistances of the grains and grain boundaries of the CCTO films\nwere tuned by changing annealing atmosphere and temperature. Under oxygen-absent\n(nitrogen) annealing atmosphere, the resistance of the grain boundaries decreases\neven at an annealing temperature of 200 oC, and this decrease of the resistance was\nenhanced when the annealing temperature increases. While the resistance of the grains\nkeeps almost the same at about 25 \u03a9, irrelevant to the annealing temperature, as\n5\n\n\fshown in the insert figures of Fig.2(b), 2(d) and 2(e), respectively. However, under\noxygen annealing atmosphere, the reverse happened. First, the resistance of the grain\nboundaries was restored and even increased with the increase of annealing\ntemperature. Second, the resistance of the grains also increased significantly after\npost-annealed in oxygen atmosphere.\nThe CCTO films crystalize at 720 oC, which is well above the present annealing\ntemperatures. From XRD and SEM reasults, we found no structural changes for the\nsamples experienced all the above post-annealing processes. Thus, the resistence\nvariations was not from crystalline structural change. On the other hand, it is a well\nknown fact that when the peroviskite oxide are subject to reduced oxygen atmosphere\nannealing, such as in nitrogen gas, oxygen vacancies are produced by the following\nprocess in some oxygen-stoichimetric region:\nOo(Oxygen ion at its normal site)\n\nVo++(Oxygen vacancy) + 2e- + 1/2O2 (1)\n\nThis process can be reversed only after the samples with oxygen vacancies are\nannealed in oxygen atmosphere at proper temperatures. In the current study, when the\nfilm was annealed in nitrogen atmosphere, resistence decreases were only found in the\ngrain boundaries, indicating that oxygen vacacies only formed in the grain boundaries\nbut not inside the grains. This point demonstrated that the grain boundaries are\noriginally close to oxygen-stoichimetric.\nWhen the film annealed in oxygen atmosphere, the resistance of the grain\nboundaries restored or even increased. In addition, the resistence of grains also\nincreased. This informs us that, when the films are post-annealed in oxygen\natmosphere, the reverse reaction of Eq. (1) happened, and the oxygen vacancies in\nboth grain boundaries and grains are compensated. Thus, in the grains, which were\nalready oxygen deficient with semiconducting nature, the reaction of Eq. (1) is\ndifficult to happen in reducing atmosphere. However, the reverse process of Eq.(1) is\neasy to happen when annealed in oxygen atmosphere. This leads to their resistance\ninert to the post-annealing in reducing atmosphere, and sensitive to the post-annealing\nin oxygen atmosphere. Here we note that in ordinary perovskite oxide polycrystalline\nfilms, such as BST films, the grains and grain boundaries are originally both\n6\n\n\foxygen-stoichimetric and insulating. When post-annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at\nproper temperatures, oxygen vacancies will be generated in both, resulting in the\nincrease of the dielectric constant in the low-frequency region. Subsequent annealing\nin oxygen atmosphere will compensate these oxygen vacancies, causing the\ndisappearance of the low-frequency dielectric dispersion22,23 Thus, the decrease of the\ndielectric constant to a value lower than the original one can not occur. However, for\nthe present CCTO polycrystalline films, the grains are originally deficient. In the last\nstep of post-annealing in Table 1, not only the oxygen vacancies in the grain\nboundaries but also those in the grains were compensated, leading to the increase of\nthe resistances of the grains and grain boundaries. Thus, the original semiconducting\ngrains become partially insulating, resulting the increase of the effective thickness of\nthe grain boundaries. Hence, the dielectric constant can be decreased even below the\noriginal value.\nTo analyze the details of the impedance response of the CCTO thin films, we\nmay assign a model equivalent circuit. Conventionally, the simplest equivalent circuit\nis a series network of three parallel RC elements, which has been applied successfully\nin the CCTO ceramics, 4,17 as shown in Fig. 3(a). Each RC element represents one of\nthe responses of grain, grain boundary and electrode interface, and will give rise to a\nsemicircular arc in the impedance Z*\n\nplot. The grain and grain boundary responses\n\ncan be identified by the magnitude of C associated with each arc, which are typically\nof the order of pF and nF, respectively. 21 It is not necessary to include an impedance\nelement representing the electrodes when the contact resistance is small, as in the\npresent experiment. For such a circuit, the complex impedance of each arc is given\nby:\nZ* =\n\nR\nR\n=\n(1 + j\u03c9 RC ) (1 + j\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c4 = RC , is the relaxation time constant of the RC element and \u03c9 is the angular\nfrequency. In the complex impedance plane plot, the frequency at which the\nsemicircular arc maximum occurs is determined by the relaxation time constant \u03c4 ,\nand can be described by:\n7\n\n\f\u03c9max = \u03c4 \u22121 = ( RC )\n\n\u22121\n\n(3)\n\nUsing Eqs. (2) and (3), the elements of the equivalent RC circuit can be extracted\nform Z* plots, and the fitting results of the CCTO thin films was summarized in Table\nII. The curve in Fig. 2 is drawn according to the fitting results.\nBecause we used ideal resistors and capacitors in the RC equivalent circuit, each\nsemicircle in the Z* plots should be perfect with its center on the real axis of the\ncomplex plane, just like the behavior of the as-deposited CCTO thin films. However,\nas shown in Fig. 2 (d-g), the experiment arc at high annealing temperatures could not\nyield a perfect semicircle, but a depressed one with its center below the real, which\nindicates that the electrical response of grain boundaries or grains in the annealed\nCCTO thin films exhibit a kind of distributing impedance response. The distributing\nfactor in the equivalent circuit should be taken into account. In order to obtain better\nfitting, constant phase element (CPE) is introduced to replace the capacitor in the RC\ncircuit as shown in Fig. 3(b). It is known that the impedance of CPE can be described\nas:20\n\n1\nZ CPE = ( ) \u00d7 ( j\u03c9 ) \u2212 n\nA\n\n(4)\n\nWhere \u03c9 is the angular frequency, A and n are constants and 0 \u2264 n \u2264 1 . The CPE\ndescribes an ideal capacitor with C = A for n = 1 and an ideal resistor with\nR = 1 A for n = 0 . Thus, Eq. (2) can be modified as:\n\nZ* =\n\n(\n\nR\n\n1 + ( j\u03c9 ) RA\nn\n\n=\n\n) (\n\nR\n\n1 + ( j\u03c9\u03c4 )\n\nn\n\n(5)\n\n)\n\nwhere \u03c4 n = RA , and Eq. (3) can be expressed as:\n\n\u03c9max = \u03c4 \u22121 = ( RA )\n\n\u22121 n\n\n(6)\n\nUsing the above equations, the equivalent circuit elements can be fitted from the\n\nZ* plots. The triangle dots in Fig. 2 are the fitting result by using CPE model, and the\nfitting parameters are listed in Table II. It can be seen that the fitted impedance curves\nare in better agreement with experiment data than those using the RC model. Such\nphenomenon was also found in another BLC material: Li and Ti doped NiO.24,25\n8\n\n\fThe fitting results also support our explanation about the variation of the\ndielectric properties. The distributed electrical response is always associated with the\ndistribution of relaxation times, and this distribution is a result of the distributed\nelements caused by the presence of electrical inhomogeneities in the samples.20 In the\npresent work, the as-deposited CCTO thin films consists two types of electrical\ncomponents: grains and the grain boundaries. From Table II and Fig. 2, we can find\nthat both RC model and CPE model can fit the IS data very well for the as-deposited\nCCTO thin films. The CPE model with a value for n = 0.99 is actually the RC model,\nwhich indicates that the components of grains and grain boundaries in the\nas-deposited CCTO thin films are nearly electrical homogeneous. Similar results were\nalso found in the CCTO thin films annealed at 200 oC in oxygen or nitrogen\natmosphere. However, at higher annealing temperatures, distributed impedance\nresponse in grain boundaries or grains becomes evident. Obviously, when the film\nwas post-annealed at higher temperature, the reaction (1) and its reverse process is\neasy to happen. In addition, we propose that, in some regions of the film, such as the\ninterface of the grains and grain boundaries, the rate of the reaction (1) is different\nfrom the others, which leads to the electrical properties of these regions being\ndifferent one from the other. This can generate electrical inhomogeneities in the\ncomponents of the sample. So the RC model could not describe the experiment data\nwhile the CPE model is more suitable for the post-annealed polycrystalline CCTO\nthin films. Moreover, we also found that when the films are annealed in oxygen\natmosphere at 550 oC, the capacitance of the observed semicircle is in the order of pF,\nwhich is the value close to that of the grains, confirming our assumption that the large\narc in Fig. 2(g) was originated from the grain components.\n\nV. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn\n\nsummary,\n\nPolycrystalline\n\nCCTO\n\nthin\n\nfilms\n\nwere\n\nfabricated\n\non\n\nPt/Ti/SiO2/Si(100) substrates by PLD. Using IS technique, the electrical\nmicrostructures of the as-deposited and post-annealed polycrystalline CCTO thin\nfilms were studied. Our study demonstrated that the as-deposited polycrystalline\n9\n\n\fCCTO film consists of insulating grain boundaries with semiconducting grains,\nindicating that the high-dielectric-constant is attributed to the BLC effects. A\ntraditional RC model does not give a good fit to the experimental data at high\nannealing temperatures. A modified model, which the capacitor in the RC circuit\nreplaced by a constant phase element, was then used to fit the IS data and excellent\nagreement between the calculated and measured curves was obtained. Moreover, it\nwas found that when the films are annealed in different post-annealing atmosphere\nand temperature, the electric properties of the grains and the grain boundaries are\ndifferent, which means that the dielectric properties of the CCTO thin films can be\ntuned through different annealing processes. Our results also provided additional\nevidence for the nature of the semiconductivity grains and insulating grain\nboundaries.\n\nVI.
