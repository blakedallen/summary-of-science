Underlying Event and MinBias Studies\nThe existence of Monte Carlo models that simulate accurately QCD hard-scattering events\nis essential for all new physics searches at hadron-hadron colliders. To achieve a given accuracy\none should be able not only to have a good model of the hard scattering part of the process, but\nalso of the beam-beam remnants (BBR) and the multiple parton interactions (MPI), an unavoidable background to most collider observables. For Drell-Yan production, the final state includes a\nlepton-antilepton pair, and there is no colored final state radiation, thus providing a clean way to\nstudy the underlying event (UE). The methodology of the presented study is similar to previous\nCDF UE studies [1], by considering toward, away, and transverse regions defined by the azimuthal\nangle \u2206\u03c6 relative to the direction of the leading jet in the event, or the direction of the lepton-pair\nin Drell-Yan production (\u2206\u03c6 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6 jet1 /pair ). We study charged particles with pT >0.5 GeV/c and\n| \u03b7 |<1 in the above-mentioned regions. For high-pT jet production we require that the leading\njet in the event, reconstructed with the MidPoint algorithm, have | \u03b7 jet |<2. For Drell-Yan production we require the invariant mass of the lepton-pair to be in the mass region of the Z-boson,\n70< M pair <110 GeV/c2 , with | \u03b7 pair |<6. The underlying event observables are found to be reasonably flat with the increasing lepton pair transverse momentum in the transverse and toward regions,\nbut distributions go up in the away region to balance lepton pairs. In Fig. 1(a) and (b), we plot two\n\nFigure 1: The underlying event observables in Drell-Yan production.\n\nobservables corresponding to the underlying event: the charged particle number density and the\ncharged transverse momentum sum density in the transverse region, compared with PYTHIA Tune\nA and AW [2]-[3], HERWIG [4] without MPI and a previous results of CDF analysis of underlying\nevents with the leading jet. There is very good agreement with PYTHIA tune AW MC predictions,\nwhile HERWIG produces much less activity. The comparison with leading jet underlying event\nresults shows close agreement, which indicates the universality of underlying event modeling. The\nbehavior of the average charged-particle pT versus charged-particle multiplicity is also important.\nThe rate of change of pT versus charged multiplicity is a measure of the amount of hard versus\nsoft processes contributing, and it is sensitive to the modeling of the multiple-parton interactions.\nPYTHIA Tune A and Tune AW do a good job in describing the data on < pT > versus multiplicity\nfor minbias and Drell-Yan events. The behavior of < pT > versus multiplicity is remarkably similar for minbias events and Drell-Yan events, suggesting that MPI are playing an important role in\nboth these processes. Models with MPI predict that the underlying event will become much more\n2\n\n\fSoft QCD Results from CDF\n\nChristina Mesropian\n\nactive at the LHC. A lot can be learned by comparing the Tevatron results with early measurements\nat the LHC, to improve modeling of the underlying event for future precision measurements.\n1.1 Hyperons\nWe also report a set of measurements of inclusive invariant pT differential cross sections of\n\u039b0 , \u039b\u03040 , \u039e\u00b1 , and \u03a9\u00b1 hyperons reconstructed in the central region with | \u03b7 |<1 and pT <10GeV /c.\nEvents were collected with a minimum-bias trigger. As pT increases, the slopes of the differential\ncross sections remain similar, which could indicate universality of particle production in pT . The\nproduction ratios \u039e\u2212 /\u039b0 and \u03a9\u2212 /\u039b0 were also studied as a function of pT and are fairly constant\nin the high pT region.\n\n2. Diffractive results\nThe CDF collaboration contributed extensively [5]-[13] to significant progress in understanding diffraction by studying a wide variety of diffractive processes at three different center-of-mass\nenergies: 630 GeV, 1800 GeV, Run I of Tevatron, and 1960 GeV - Run II. Some important results include the observation of QCD factorization breakdown in hard single diffractive processes,\ndiscovery of large rapidity gaps between two jets, study of diffractive structure function in double\npomeron exchange dijet events. Diffractive W/Z production is an important process for probing the quark content of the pomeron, since to leading order, the W/Z is produced through a\nquark, while gluon associated production is suppressed by a factor of \u03b1S and can be identified\nby an additional jet. CDF studied diffractive W production in Run I [6] by using the rapidity\ngap signature of diffractive events. In Run II, we select events with \"intact leading antiproton\"\nsignature, where p\u0304 is detected in the Roman Pot Spectrometers (RPS). The RPS allows very precise measurement of the fractional momentum loss of p\u0304 (\u03be ), eliminating the problem of gap survival probability. The novel feature of the analysis, the determination of the full kinematics of\nthe W \u2192 l \u03bd decay, is made possible by obtaining the neutrino ET \u03bd from the missing ET , E/T ,\nE/\nand \u03b7\u03bd from the formula \u03be RPS \u2212 \u03be cal = \u221aTs e\u2212\u03b7\u03bd , where \u03be RPS is the true \u03be measured in RPS and\n\u221a\n\u03be cal = \u2211i(towers) (ETi / s)exp(\u2212\u03b7 i ). The fractions of diffractive W and Z events are measured to be\n[0.97 \u00b1 0.05(stat.) \u00b1 0.11(syst.)]% and [0.85 \u00b1 0.20(stat.) \u00b1 0.11(syst.)]% for the kinematic range\n0.03< \u03be <0.10 and | t |<1 GeV/c. The measured diffractive W fraction is consistent with the Run\nI CDF result when corrected for the \u03be and t range.\n2.1 Central Exclusive production\nThe exclusive dijet production was first studied by CDF in Run I data and a limit of \u03c3excl <3.7\nnb (95% CL) was placed [14]. This study was continued in Run II when the observation of the\nexclusive dijet production was reported [15]. The exclusive signal is extracted using the dijet mass\nfraction method: the ratio R j j \u2261 M j j /MX of the dijet mass M j j to the total mass MX of the final\nstate is formed and used to discriminate between the signal of exclusive dijets, defined as R j j >0.8,\nand the background of inclusive double pomeron exchange dijets, expected to have a continuous\ndistribution concentrated at lower R j j values. The measured cross sections [15] are consistent with\npredictions by Khoze et al. [16].\n3\n\n\fSoft QCD Results from CDF\n\nChristina Mesropian\n\nAnother process which is closely related to exclusive Higgs production is exclusive diphoton\nproduction p p\u0304 \u2192 p\u03b3\u03b3 p\u0304. CDF has performed a search for exclusive \u03b3\u03b3 using a 0.5 fb\u22121 data sample\nobtained with a trigger requiring the presence of two electromagnetic (EM) towers and forward\ngaps in both forward directions. Three candidate events were found, by requiring all calorimeters\nto be empty, and no tracks to be associated with two EM trigger towers. Two of these events are\nlikely to be \u03b3\u03b3 , and the third is more likely to be \u03c0 0 \u03c0 0 . A limit was placed on exclusive diphoton\nproduction of 410 fb at 95% CL [17]. The prediction [18] is compatible with this limit. CDF plans\nto update this measurement with additional available data.\nCDF II also studied dimuon production, when the event signature requires two oppositely\ncharged central muons, and either no other particles (large forward rapidity gaps), or one additional\nphoton detected. Within the kinematic region | \u03b7 (\u03bc ) |<0.6 and M\u03bc \u03bc \u2208 [3.0, 4.0] GeV/c2 , there are\n402 events with no EM shower, see the M\u03bc \u03bc spectrum in Fig. 2(left).\nThe J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 (2S) are prominent, together with a continuum. By requiring one EM shower\nwith ETEM >80 MeV in addition to the requirement mentioned above, we are able to measure\n\u03c7c0 production. Allowing EM tower causes a large increase (+ 66 events) in the J psi peak and\nminor change (+1 event) in the \u03c8 (2S) peak. After correcting for background, efficiencies, and the\nbranching fraction, we obtain a cross section for exclusive \u03c7c0 production of 75\u00b110(stat)\u00b110(syst)\nnb [19], which is compatible with the theoretical predictions [20]-[21].\n2.2 Double Diffractive processes\nDouble diffractive (DD) dissociation is the process in which two colliding hadrons dissociate\ninto clusters of particles (jets in case of hard DD dissociation) producing events with a large nonexponentially suppressed central pseudo-rapidity gap.\ndRgap\n\u00d7 Nbins (2.2<\u2206\u03b7<6.6)\nd\u2206\u03b7\n\nGap Fraction in events with a CCAL gap\n\nCDF II Preliminary\n\nMinBias\n\n1\n\njet1,2\n\n> 2GeV\n\njet1,2\n\n> 4GeV\n\nMPp\u2022MPp Jets, ET\n\nR gap\u2261 N gap /N all\n\nMPp\u2022MPp Jets, ET\n\n3.5<| \u03b7jet1,2 |<5.1\n\n10-1\nCCAL gap\nrequired\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n\u2206\u03b7=\u03b7max-\u03b7min\n\nFigure 2: (left) Mass M\u03bc \u03bc distribution of 402 exclusive events, with no EM shower, (histogram) together\nwith a fit to two Gaussians for the J/\u03c8 and \u03c8 (2S), and a QED continuum.
