Introduction\nEffective field theory (EFT) approach, which shed new light on the methodology of\nnuclear physics, was used to reformulate the parity-violating (PV) nucleon-nucleon\n(N N ) interaction recently,1 and the potential has been applied to a few two-nucleon\nproblems.2,3 The PV two-pion-exchange (TPE) contribution to physical observables\nturned out to be non-negligible, but was not so significant as the TPE in the strong\nN N interaction. On the other hand, a PV N N contact term parametrized by a\nlow-energy constant (LEC), which is presumed to subsume the heavy degrees of\nfreedom and higher-order corrections, is comparable to the PV TPE contribution.\n1\n\n\fJanuary 11, 2019 0:58 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\nhyun \u0307071113\n\nC. H. Hyun et al.\n\nMore importantly, the LEC term (the contact term) is highly singular at short\ndistances and depends critically on the regularization methods and renormalization\nschemes. With the lack of experimental data to determine the LEC value, it is not\nfeasible to sharpen the theoretical prediction furthermore.\nAs a partial resolution to the uncertainty associated with the LEC term, we\nconsider the covariant formulation of the PV TPE potential, which was already\ncarried out in 1970's.4,5,6 Compared to the TPE and LEC terms in EFT, the\ncovariant formalism gives a potential which is finite and has no unknown constant.\nMoreover, it is less singular at short distances than that from EFT, and contains\nmore higher-order 1/M contributions. In this work we focus on comparing the TPE\npotential from the covariant formalism with that from EFT. By calculating a PV\nasymmetry in ~np \u2192 d\u03b3 with these potentials, we estimate the correction from the\nhigher-order terms embedded in the covariant potential. The analysis will provide\nan indirect estimation of the correction due to the LEC term in EFT.\n2. Formalism\nThe PV TPE potential contains various spin and isospin components. Keeping the\nspin and isospin operators only relevant for the asymmetry A\u03b3 in ~np \u2192 d\u03b3, we get\nthe following expression :\n~\nnp\nVTPE\n(~r) = i(~\u03c41 \u00d7 ~\u03c42 )z (~\u03c31 + ~\u03c32 ) * [~\np, v56 (r)] + (\u03c41z \u2212 \u03c42z ) (~\u03c31 + ~\u03c32 ) * {~p, v75 (r)} .

The component v56\ngiven by Eq. (5) is almost the same as the corresponding\n3\nTPE term in EFT, except for the factor gA\nof the first term in the square bracket,\n2\nwhich is gA in EFT. The discrepancy is explained in Ref. 7, and it is concluded that\nthe leading 1/M term extracted from the covariant form is in principle equivalent\nto the TPE term obtained from EFT. In the next section, we present numerical\nresults for the potentials and their application.\n3.

The factor a\u03b3\ndepends on both strong and weak dynamics. In order to reduce the uncertainty from\nthe strong interaction, we employ the Argonne v18 potential to obtain the parityconserving part of the wave function. Numerical results for a\u03b3 are summarized in\nTable 1. The covariant contributions from v56 and v75 are summed to cancel strongly,\n0.0093 \u2212 0.0040 = 0.0053, which is much smaller than the one-pion-exchange (OPE)\ncov\n, which contains infinite orders of\none, \u22120.1120. Comparing the contribution of v56\nLM\n3\n1/M , with v56 , which is proportional to 1/M , the higher-order 1/M corrections\nare non-negligible, but less significant than the leading 1/M contribution.\nIn summary, the behavior of the potential at short distances and the PV asymmetry in ~np \u2192 d\u03b3 show that the uncertainty due to the corrections from the degrees\nof freedom integrated out of the model is still significant, and it requires further\ninvestigation. However, the TPE and higher-order contributions to A\u03b3 , in either\ncovariant or EFT form, gives a correction about 10 % at most. Recent calculations\nof the \u2206(1232) resonance contribution to the PV potential in EFT show that the\npresent result of A\u03b3 is not much affected by the \u2206 contribution.8 To the extent\ninvestigated so far, A\u03b3 is dominated by the PV OPE potential with an uncertainty\nof about 10% at most. The precise measurement of A\u03b3 will thus provide a unique\nopportunity to determine the value of h1\u03c0 .\nAcknowledgments\nWork of CHH was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant funded by\nthe Korean Government (MOEHRD, Basic Research Promotion Fund) (KRF-2007313-C00178).
