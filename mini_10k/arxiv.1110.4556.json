Analysis of the electronic states reveals that the gap\nis related to shell closings of the metallic electrons in a tetrahedrally distorted effective potential.\nPACS numbers: 61.46.Bc, 36.40.Cg, 31.15.E-\n\nGold is a magic element that constantly brings us surprises. The relativistic effect has been demonstrated\nto be a dominating factor that distinguishes gold from\nthe same-group elements such as copper and silver1 .\nMany intriguing structures and properties are found\nfor nanometer-sized gold clusters. One example is the\ntransition from a two-dimensional structure to a threedimensional one around a size of 10 atoms2,3 . Another\nis the unique catalytic activity of nanometer-sized gold\nclusters4 .\nAmong all gold nanoclusters, Au20 is probably the\nmost famous one5 . It has a simple tetrahedral symmetry with every gold atom on the surface. The tetrahedral symmetry is very stable and is the ground state\nboth in charged and neutral clusters6 . The symmetry\nis still retained if one atom is removed to form Au19 6\nand is proposed to be present in chemically synthesized\nAu20 (PPh3 )8 clusters7 .\nIt is common for gold clusters that the frontier orbitals around Fermi energy are derived from Au(6s)\natomic orbitals and form delocalized states distributed\nover the whole cluster8 . Very similar to the stability\nof noble gas atoms in the periodic system of elements,\na closed electronic shell built up from these delocalized\nstates improves the energetics and gives more chemical stability, i.e. reduced reactivity9 . This effect also\nleads to enhanced stability for specific sizes in protected\ngold clusters10,11 . Spherical shell closings are especially\nprominent as these are known to lead to large gaps between highest occupied (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied\nmolecular orbitals (LUMO), the signature of chemical\nstability.\nIn the case of deformations of the background potential, the Jahn-Teller effect can lead to stabilizations\nwhere spherical shell closings are not available9. A special case here is octupole deformations, where in particular tetrahedral deformations produce large gaps12 .\nThe appearance of tetrahedral deformations is proposed in nuclear physics13 where the delocalized particle\npicture in an effective background potential had originated before it was adopted in cluster physics. While the\nexperimental observation of the tetrahedral deformation\nin nuclei seems to be under debate14,15 , the importance\n\nof tetrahedral symmetry in cluster physics in the case of\nAu20 is beyond question16 .\nMagic tetrahedral metal clusters were proposed in\nthe jellium model12 .\nIn particular, in the essentially parameter-free ultimate jellium model, where the\nsmeared out nuclear density exactly follows the electronic\ndensity, the 40 electron ground state shows a tetrahedral\ndeformation17 . In spherical symmetry the electrons' angular momentum is conserved and the relative energies\nof different angular momentum shells (and also the gaps\nbetween them) depend on the effective radial potential.\nThere is a large gap for a harmonic radial potential at 40\nelectrons. This gap decreases when the potential becomes\nmore box like, however9. Here a tetrahedral deformation\ncan open the gap again. To our knowledge, tetrahedral\nmetal clusters larger than the rather trivial case of four\natoms have been observed only in the example of Au20 .\nIn this Letter, we show from density functional theorybased global minimization that the larger Au40 has a\ntwisted trigonal pyramid structure of quasi-tetrahedral\nsymmetry, the first case of a metal cluster of tetrahedral\nshape beyond Au20 .\nAlthough gold clusters with 20 atoms or less have been\nextensively studied, we know relatively little of the structures of larger gold clusters. Au clusters with 30 to 60\natoms would be the key to understanding the transition\nfrom the molecular behavior of a small cluster to the\nmetallic bulk. The clusters Au32 18,19 and Au34 20 have\nbeen proposed to have a core-shell structure, instead of\nbeing hollow or planar. More recently, the global minima\nof Au28 to Au35 were explored in comparison with experimental photoelectron spectra21 . The authors found that\nthe global minima are amorphous in nature with an Au4\ntetrahedron core and a much bigger outer-shell for AuN\nwith N > 32. Using an empirical potential for global\nminimum search followed by density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations, Garz\u00f3n et al. found that the most\nstable structure of Au38 is of Cs symmetry with an Au5\ncore22,23 . This structure was found to be slightly lower\nin energy than the high-symmetry truncated octahedron\n(by about 0.3 to 0.6 eV, depending on the choice of DFT\nfunctional22,23 ). Both the Cs and octahedral structures\nare metallic (that is, their HOMOs are not completely\n\n\f2\nfilled). Using a strategy similar to Garz\u00f3n et al.'s, Tran\nand Johnston found a structure for Au40 with a distorted\ntruncated octahedron24 .\n\nFIG. 1. Energy landscape of a DFT-based basin-hopping\nsearch for the global minimum of Au38 , started with the octahedral structure.\n\nPuzzled by the metallic nature of Au38 of the state-ofthe-art models and expecting a high-symmetry structure\nfor Au40 , we set out to find the global minima of Au38\nand Au40 , hypothesizing that Au40 's structure will build\nupon that of Au38 . Instead of using the empirical potentials to search for global minima before DFT optimization, as previously done for Au38 and Au40 , we use DFT\ngeometry optimization at the GGA-PBE level25 directly\nin our basin-hopping global-minimum search26 . This approach has been quite powerful for exploring the energy\nlandscape of nanoclusters27,28 . What distinguishes our\nwork from previous DFT-based basin-hopping search for\nthe similar-sized gold clusters is that we run the basinhopping procedure for much more steps (over 1000) to\nexplore the energy landscape.\nFig. 1 shows our DFT-based basin-hopping search for\nthe global minimum of Au38 , started with the highly symmetric octahedral structure. One can see that the octahedral structure (Fig. 1a) was transformed into much less\nsymmetric configurations of lower energy. The energy\nlowering is quite substantial, more than 2 eV, instead of\nthe 0.3 to 0.6 eV lowering found by Garz\u00f3n et al. for\ntheir Cs model22,23 . After a local minimum with one\nadatom sticking out (Fig. 1b), we found two putative\nglobal minima (Fig. 1c and 1d) which are almost degenerate in energy (within 30 meV). The two structures have\na similar construction: an Au4 core and an Au32 shell,\nwith two Au adatoms sticking out; but one with C1 symmetry (Fig. 1c), the other with C2 symmetry (Fig. 1d).\nWhat is unique about the two structures is that they\nboth have a sizable HOMO-LUMO gap, indicating their\n\nmolecule-like stability in the gas phase. The C1 structure\nhas a gap of 0.66 eV and the C2 structure 0.84 eV, unlike the metallic nature of the octahedral structure and\nGarz\u00f3n et al.'s Cs model22,23 . Hence we confirmed that\nthe nanometer-sized Au38 still behaves as a molecule.\n\nFIG. 2. Energy landscape of a DFT-based basin-hopping\nsearch for the global minimum of Au40 .\n\nFIG. 3. The global minimum for Au40 featuring a twisted\npyramid with a missing corner: (a) top view, the missing\ncorner is at the top of the figure; (b) side view, the Au4 tetrahedral core is highlighted in red.\n\nThe two Au38 minima are also interesting in that they\nhave two adatoms on the Au4 @Au32 core shell. This\nconstruction shares some similarity with the Au35 structure where one adatom is on the Au4 @Au30 core shell21 .\nWhat Au38 's structure suggested to us is that Au40 's\nstructure can build upon the Au4 @Au32 core-shell framework but with four adatoms placed in tetrahedral symmetry. This idea led us to propose an initial guess for\nAu40 (Fig. 2a) with two more adatoms manually added\nto one of the Au38 's two candidate structures (Fig. 1c).\nStarted with this initial guess, we performed DFT-based\nbasin-hopping search for over 1000 steps. Interestingly,\ntwisted pyramid structures evolved out. The first one\nevolved out is a twisted trigonal pyramid with a missing\ncorner (Fig. 2b and Fig. 3); the core is still an Au4 tetrahedron (Fig. 3b); overall, the cluster has C1 symmetry.\nThe second one evolved out is a twisted trigonal pyramid\nwith a missing core atom (Fig. 2c and Fig. 4); this struc-\n\n\f3\nture has C3 symmetry, with an Au3 triangle core (Fig.\n4b). The C3 symmetry can also be clearly seen from the\nbase of the pyramid (Fig. 4c). The top three layers of\nthe pyramid share the same substructure as the famous\ntetrahedral Au20 . Both Au40 structures are chiral as was\nfirst proposed for Au34 20 .\n\n5 \u00014 \u0002 3\nb) Au40 C1 6s\n\n\u00056\n\n\u00065\n\n\u00074\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4. An isomer of Au40 featuring a twisted pyramid with\nC3 symmetry: (a) top view; (b) side view, showing the Au3\ntriangle core; (c) bottom view, showing the base of the pyramid.\n\nTo gain a deeper insight into the consequences of\nthe tetrahedral symmetry we now discuss the electronic\nstructure and energetics of the two Au40 isomers. We\nfound that the C1 isomer is the most stable among all\nthe configurations explored; it has a HOMO-LUMO gap\nof 0.69 eV. The C3 isomer is only 0.15 eV higher in energy\nand has an even larger gap of 0.85 eV. So both isomers\nare stable molecules in nature, given these rather large\ngaps in clusters of this size. Moreover, we found that\nif one manually moves the apex atom of the C1 isomer\nto the missing corner (Fig. 3a), the resultant structure\nis only slightly higher in energy (by 0.07 eV), indicating\nthe robustness of Au40 's tetrahedral shape despite the\nmultiple isomers close in energy.\nThe large HOMO-LUMO gaps of Au40 are related to\ntetrahedral symmetry. In perfectly spherical clusters one\nfinds each DFT Kohn-Sham orbital to be in an unique\nangular momentum eigenstate relative to the cluster's\ncenter of mass. Due to the deformation of the nuclear\nbackground away from spherical symmetry these states\nare not clean anymore. A tetrahedral deformation as\npresent here can be described by an effective potential of\nthe form12,29\n\u0002\n\u0003\nV (r) = V (r) 1 + \u03b132 (T3,+2 \u2212 T3,\u22122) )\n(1)\nwhere r = |r|, the T3,\u00b12 are spherical tensor operators\nand \u03b132 is a constant describing the degree of the deformation. The exact form of the T3,\u00b12 is not important\nfor our purpose; one only has to note that these operators couple angular momentum eigenstates with angular\nmomentum projections that differ by \u00b12 exclusively.\nWith these considerations we analyze the electronic\nstructure of the tetrahedral gold clusters in Fig. 530 .\nWe project the DFT Kohn-Sham orbitals onto spherical angular momentum eigenstates relative to the cluster center of mass to extract their delocalized nature10 .\nThe usual nomenclature characterizing the states' angular momentum is similar to atomic physics S, P, D, . . . ,\n\nI\nH\nG\n\na) Au20 6s\n\n3\n\n\u000e2\n\n\b3\n\n\u00032\n\n\u00041\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nc) Au40 C1\n\n1 Au C 0\nd)\n40 3\n\n\u000f1\n\n0\n\nenergy [eV]\n\n3F\n\nD\nP\n\n1\n\n2 S\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\nFIG. 5. (Color online) The density of states relative to Fermi\nenergy projected on angular momentum eigenfunctions relative to the clusters center of mass. In a, b) only the Au(6s)\nelectrons are treated as valence electrons, whereas in c, d) also\nthe Au(5d) electrons are allowed to rearrange.\n\nwhere capital letters distinguish from atom centered angular momenta. The principle quantum number n gives\nthe energetic ordering which is connected to the (n \u2212 1)\nnumber of radial nodes of the corresponding eigenfunctions. In spherical clusters one would expect the delocalized states to fill 1S2 1P6 1D10 2S2 orbitals for 20 electrons\nand additionally the 1F14 2P6 orbitals for 40 electrons.\nTo obtain a clean picture of delocalized states we first\nfix all the electrons except the Au(6s) electrons in a frozen\ncore approximation. The projected density of states\n(PDOS) for Au20 obtained in this way is presented in\nFig. 5a. The states of lowest energy are the delocalized\n1S and three 1P states, similar as in the spherical case.\nThis is understandable as the magnetic quantum number\nof these states is 0, \u00b11 and hence these could only couple to higher angular momentum states far away in energy through the T3,\u00b12 operators in eq. (1). Then there\nfollows a block of 4 states with mixed S/P/D/F symmetry due to the T3,\u00b12 coupling, immediately followed\nby two states of pure D symmetry that form the Au20\nHOMO. After the substantial gap of 2.06 eV, the Au20\nLUMO consists of 3 states with S/P/G symmetry and is\nfollowed by a block of 3+2 states of dominant F symmetry. After these there is another large gap. This analysis\nclearly shows how sparse the delocalized electronic states\nare distributed under tetrahedral deformations and that\nthe electronic system can make gain from closing shells\nin the corresponding symmetry.\nAnalyzing the Au40 states in the same way leads to a\nvery comparable picture as shown in Fig. 5b. The relative gaps between the blocks of states gets smaller due\nto the larger size of the cluster, but the symmetry of the\nstates is similar. In this cluster the rather large HOMOLUMO gap is between the F/P symmetry dominated oc-\n\n\f4\ncupied states and the G symmetry dominated unoccupied\nstates. Including Au(5d) states as valence electrons into\nthe calculation does not change the picture of the frontier\norbitals around the Fermi energy as shown in Fig. 5c and\nd. A comparison with the C3 isomer that has a clearer\ntetrahedral structure indicates that in terms of symmetry\nthe HOMO of the C1 isomer belongs rather to the LUMO\nblock of states with dominant P/G symmetry. As a consequence the gap of the C3 isomer is even larger than that\nof the C1 isomer. Finally we have analyzed the deformation of the s-valence electron density as it was done for\nthe near tetrahedral shape of Na40 31 . While we obtain\nfor the largest distortion parameter S3 = 0.04 for Na40 32\nin agreement with ref. 31, S3 = 0.26, 0.33 for the C1 , C3\nisomers of Au40 respectively, accounting for the much\nlarger tetrahedral distortion present in the gold clusters.\nIn summary, we found Au40 to be a magic cluster with\na quasi-tetrahedral symmetry.

This cluster is a manifestation of\nthe enhanced stability due to the tetrahedral symmetry,\npredicted both in nuclear structure and by the jellium\nmodel. Analysis of the delocalized electrons in Au40 confirms the shell-closing picture by the tetrahedral symmetry, similar to that of Au20 . The delocalized 6s electrons\nand the complex energy landscape for clusters such as\nAu40 cannot be accurately described by empirical potentials, thereby making DFT-based global-minimum search\na necessity.\nThis work was supported by the Division of Chemical\nSciences, Geosciences, and Biosciences, Office of Basic\nEnergy Sciences, U.S. Department of Energy.

Calculations using a\nhigher level meta-GGA approximation36 yield similar results.\nA Python script was used to interface the basinhopping algorithm37 and the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package38,39 for planewave DFT calculations with the\nscalar-relativistic projector-augmented wave (PAW) potential for Au which allows use of a low cutoff energy of\n172.5 eV. The neutral cluster was placed in the center of\na 1.8 \u00d7 1.8 \u00d7 1.8 nm3 box. At each step, a full geometry optimization was performed, and the final energy was\ncompared with the previous one for a Metroplis sampling\n\n\f5\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\nwith a temperature of 7500 K. Then, all Cartesian coordinates were displaced by a random number in [-1,1] times\nthe step size of 0.07 nm. After about 1000 steps which\ntakes 256 parallel cores on a Cray XE6 supercomputer 67\nhours to finish, the chosen candidate structures were then\nfinely relaxed with a molecular quantumn chemistry code,\nTurbomole40 with the def2-TZVP basis sets.\nD.
