Possible applications can\nbe found in metallurgy, ceramics and semiconductor doping. For example, quenching is used to construct ceramic\nmaterial with a high mechanical stability [1], to design\nresistance devices for integrated circuits [2], and to improve the optoelectronic properties of semiconductors [3].\nTemperature quenching techniques are most efficient if\nthey are performed suddenly, i.e. if the system temperature changes on a time scale that is much shorter than a\ntime upon which a typical particle motion is performed.\nWhile this can be realized in computer simulations, see\ne.g. [4, 5, 6], it is practically impossible to be achieved\nfor molecular systems where the quench is performed by\na coupling to an external heat bath. There, it takes\nsome time until the prescribed temperature is realized\nin the sample. However, as we shall show in this Letter,\nan ultra-fast quenching is possible for colloidal particles\nwhich move much slower and are highly susceptible to\nexternal fields.\nIf a suspension of superparamagnetic particles is used,\nan external magnetic field induces magnetic dipoles in the\nparticles which gives rise to dipolar interactions between\nthem [7]. In equilibrium, temperature and magnetic field\nstrength determine the dimensionless coupling strength\nbetween the particles such that temperature is strictly\nequivalent to the inverse square of the magnetic field\nstrength [8, 9]. Therefore a sudden increase of the external magnetic field corresponds to an ultra-fast quench\ntowards lower temperature. It is important to note that\nthe increase of the external magnetic field occurs on a\ntime scale of a few ms much smaller than a couple of\nseconds typically needed by a colloidal particle to diffuse\nover its own size. Thereby - unlike molecular systems colloidal systems can be exposed to ultra-fast temperature quenches.\nIn this Letter, we exploit this idea of quasi in-\n\nstantaneous quenching for a binary suspension of twodimensional superparamagnetic colloidal particles confined to a planar water-air interface. At high temperatures - or equivalently at low external magnetic field\nstrengths - the system is weakly correlated. After an\nabrupt increase of the external magnetic field, the response of the system and the early stage relaxation towards its new state is monitored by real-space imaging. For the prescribed composition of the mixture, the\nequilibrium state is a crystalline lattice with alternating stripes of pure triangles of the majority component\nand mixed squares [10]. This complicated stable crystal\nis not reached on the time scale explored but the system reveals structural heterogeneities corresponding to\nlocal metastable patches of crystalline order. These crystalline zones are forming on different time scales which\nalso gives rise to nonmonotonic behaviour in time for\nstructural correlation peaks of the small particles. The\nreal-space experiments are in agreement with our Brownian dynamics computer simulations. Our results can be\nused to steer the microstructure of composite materials\nupon quenching and reveal the interplay between vitrification and crystal nucleation [11].\nThe experimental system consists of a suspension of\ntwo kinds of spherical super-paramagnetic colloidal particles denoted by A and B. Those particles are characterized by different diameters (dA = 4.5 \u03bcm, dB =\n2.8 \u03bcm) and magnetic susceptibilities (\u03c7A = 6.2 \u00d7\n10\u221211 Am2 /T, \u03c7B = 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221212 Am2 /T). The relative\ncomposition X = NB /(NA + NB ) of B particles is fixed\nat 40%. Due to their high mass density, the particles are\nconfined by gravity to a flat water-air interface formed\nby a pending water drop. The droplet is suspended by\nsurface tension in a top sealed cylindrical hole (6 mm diameter, 1 mm depth) on a glass plate. The system can\nbe considered as ideally two dimensional since the thermally activated \"out of plane\" motion of the particles is\nof the order of a few tens of nanometer. A coil produces a\n~ perpendicular to the water-air interface\nmagnetic field H\n\n\f~ with i = A, B)\ninducing a magnetic moment (m\n~ i = \u03c7i H\nin each particle which leads to a repulsive dipole-dipole\npair interaction of the form\nuij (r) =\n\n\u03bc0\n\u03c7i \u03c7j H 2 /r3\n4\u03c0\n\n(i, j = A, B).\n\n(1)\n\nFor this inverse power potential, at fixed composition X\nand susceptibility ratio \u03c7B /\u03c7A , all static quantities depend solely [12] on a dimensionless interaction strength\n(or coupling constant)\n\u0393=\n\n\u03bc0 \u03c72A H 2\n4\u03c0 kB T a3\n\nfraction of particles\n\n2\n0.2\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n(b)\n\n0.1\n\nsquare\n\ntriangular\n\n0-10 0 10 20 30 40\n0\n50 60 70 80 90 -10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n\nt/\u03c4\n\nt/\u03c4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere kB T is the thermal energy at room temperature\n\u221a\nand a = 1/ \u03c1A the average interparticle separation between A particles. The partial A particle density is set\nto \u03c1A = 1.97 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u03bcm\u22122 so that a \u2243 22.5\u03bcm. The pair\ninteraction is directly controlled over a wide range via the\nmagnetic field. Making use of video microscopy, trajectories of all particles in the field of view can be recorded\nover several days providing the whole phase space information. The quench was realized upon suddenly rising\nthe coupling \u0393 from 1 to 71 at time t = 0 by increasing\nthe magnetic field. The time scale of the quench is only\nlimited by the electronics of power supply and was measured to be 5 ms. This is much faster than the typical\nBrownian time \u03c4 = d2A /DA needed for an A particle to\ndiffuse over its own distance with DA = 0.11\u03bcm2 /s being the short-time diffusion constant for A particles. The\ntime \u03c4 is measured to be 50 s. Hence the quench can be\nconsidered to be ultra-fast. In a unquenched system clear\ndeviations of purely diffusive behavior appear already at\n\u0393 = 30. For \u0393 = 71 a well pronounced plateau between\nt/\u03c4 = 2 and t/\u03c4 = 200 is observed in the mean square\ndisplacement with an inflection point at t/\u03c4 = 40 [7].\nHence the quench can be considered to be ultra-fast and\ndeep into the supercooled stage.\nIn parallel, we perform nonequilibrium Brownian dynamics (BD) computer simulations [13] of our experimental system described above. We employ point-like dipoles\nthat interact following Eq. (1) with \u03c7B /\u03c7A = 10% and\nX = 40% in accordance to the experimental parameters.\nKnowing that the diffusion constant scales with the inverse of the radius of a particle, DB was chosen such that\nDB /DA = dA /dB . NA = 400 A particles and NB = 267\nB particles were placed in a square box with periodic\nboundary conditions applied in the two directions. A\nfinite time step \u03b4t = 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 \u03c4 was used. The early\nstage of the system response to the ultra-fast quench has\nbeen observed both in real-space experiments and BD\ncomputer simulations and was characterized by various\ntime-dependent correlations. Our first aim is to identify the dynamical formation of local crystallites after\nthe quench and detect building blocks of the underlying equilibrium crystal. The latter consists of alternating stripes of pure A triangles and intersecting squares\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Fraction of B particles belonging to a crystalline\nsquare surrounding (see inset) and (b) fraction of A particles\nbelonging to a crystalline triangular surrounding (see inset)\nversus reduced time t/\u03c4 for an ultrafast quench from \u0393 = 1 to\n\u0393 = 71. The lines are experimental data while the symbols (\u2217)\nare data from BD simulations. Two experimental snapshots\nfor a time t/\u03c4 = 0.6 just after the quench (left configuration)\nand a later time t/\u03c4 = 60 (right configuration) are shown.\nBig particles are shown in blue if they belong to a triangular\nsurrounding and in red if the belong to a square surrounding.\nAll other big particles are shown in white color.

Therefore we have used criteria to define A particles which have a pure triangular\nsurrounding of other A particles, i.e. which are close to\na cut-out of a pure triangular A crystal, and, likewise,\nwe have identified A and B particles which form locally\nan equimolar square lattice S(AB)[14]. The corresponding two structure elements are shown as insets in Figure\n1. In detail, we associate a triangular surrounding to\nan A particle if the following two criteria are fulfilled\nsimultaneously\n[9]: 1) The 6-fold bond order paramep\nP6\nter p6 = \u03a8\u22176 \u03a86 (where \u03a86 = 16 N N exp (i6\u03b8N N ) with\n\u03b8N N denoting the angles of the six nearest neighbour\nbonds relative to a fixed reference) is larger than 0.94. 2)\nP\nThe relative bond length deviation b6 = 61 6N N |lN Nl\u0304 \u2212l\u0304|\nwhere  \u0304l is the average length of the six bond lengths lN N\nis smaller than 0.04. This double condition selects local\nconfigurations close to those of a perfect triangular lattice where p6 is unity and b6 vanishes. Likewise we define\na square surrounding around a B particle by the criteria:\n\n\f3\n\nAfter a relaxation time of t = 10\u03c4 , we have further\ncalculated the mean-square displacements for particles\nwhich are crystalline (i.e colored in blue, red, green) and\nnon-crystalline particles during a time of 60\u03c4 , see Figure\n1. In both experiment and simulation, for both particles\nspecies the mean-square displacement of the uncolored\nparticles is twice as large as that of the colored ones.\nThis gives clear evidence for a correlation between local\nslow dynamics and local crystallinity.\nBy simulation we have finally explored a different\ndepth and rate of the quench (see Fig. 1). While a \"steepest descent\" quench leads to a faster growth of crystalline\n\ngAA\ngAB\n\nExperimental snapshots before and after the instantaneous quench are shown in Figure 1 with color-coded\nparticles indicating the locations of A and B particles\nwhich belong to local triangular and square clusters. If\nan A particle has a triangular surrounding all seven A\nparticles including the central one with its full surrounding are shown in blue. Conversely, if a B particle has a\nsquare surrounding it is colored in green and its four A\nneighbours are colored in red. All particles which belong\nboth to the blue and red class are shown in pink. From\nthe snapshots of Fig. 1, it is evident that the crystalline\nclusters form locally and grow as a function of time. Preferentially triangular structures form in an area depleted\nfrom B particles while square structures nucleate around\n\"seeds\" which possess a structure close to an underlying square. The resulting crystalline patches are then\nfluctuating with a life-time of about 30\u03c4 . The fraction\nof A particles with a triangular and of B particles with\na square surrounding are shown as a function of time\nin Figure 1 a) and b), respectively. On the time scale\nconsidered in this plot one finds an increase from almost\nzero before the quench to 12 percent for the triangular\nA particles and the square B particles. The time scales\nupon which triangular and square structures are formed\nare different by a factor of about 2. The triangular structure is forming more rapidly than the square one. This\nfollows from the fact that an AB square structure requires more fine-tuning of structural correlations of both\nspecies than a triangular one which can directly emerge\nin regions depleted from small particles. The number\nof pink A particles which belong to both triangular and\nsquare surroundings is growing on a time scale slightly\nlonger than that for the square structure to a fraction of\nonly 1-2 percent far away from the equilibrium structure\nwhere the fraction of pink particles is 2/3. Last but not\nleast, within the statistical error, there is agreement between the experimental data and our nonequilibrium BD\ncomputer simulations.\n\npatches and to an almost doubled crystalline fraction of\nparticles, a linear increase of \u0393 within a time window of\n30\u03c4 delays their formation accordingly.\n\ngBB\n\np\n1) The 4-fold bond order parameter p4 = \u03a8\u22174 \u03a84 (where\nP\n\u03a84 = 14 4N N exp (i4\u03b8N N ) with \u03b8N N denoting the bond\nangles of the four nearest neighbour AB bonds) is larger\nthan 0.92. 2) The corresponding relative AB bond length\ndeviation b4 is smaller than 0.05.\n\n(c)\n(b)\nBD\nBD\nBD\n5 (a)\nEXP\nEXP\nEXP\n4\n3\nt/\u03c4=1\nt/\u03c4=0\nt/\u03c4=80\n2\n1\n0\n(d)\n(e)\n(f)\n5\n4\n3\nt/\u03c4=1\nt/\u03c4=0\nt/\u03c4=80\n2\n1\n0\n(g)\n(i)\n(h)\n5\n4\n3\nt/\u03c4=1\nt/\u03c4=0\nt/\u03c4=80\n2\n1\n0\n0 1 2 3 40 1 2 3 40 1 2 3 4\n\nr/a\n\nr/a\n\nr/a\n\nFIG. 2: Partial pair distribution functions gAA (r),gAB (r) and\ngBB (r) of A- and B-particles versus reduced distance r/a at\nthree different reduced times (a),(d),(g) t/\u03c4 = 0; (b),(e),(h)\nt/\u03c4 = 1; (c),(f),(i) t/\u03c4 = 80.

First of all, there\nis again agreement between simulation and experiment\nWhile the correlations in the starting configurations before the quench are weak, they are quickly increasing as a\nfunction of time towards a strongly correlated glass. An\naveraged square order can be extracted from \u221a\nthe growth\nof an intermediate peak in gAA (r) at r = 2a. This\npeak grows much slower than the first peak amplitude.\nThe growth of the first peak amplitude in gAA (r) and\ngAB (r) are monotonic in time, whereas there is a nonmonotonicity in that of gBB (r). This is clearly visible\nin Figure 3 where the dynamical evolution of the amplitudes of all three partial pair distribution function is\nshown. With in the statistical accuracy, the peaks of\ngAA (r) and gAB (r) grow on the same time scale in a\nmonotonic way, while the peak of gBB (r) overshoots its\nfinal equilibrium limit, both in experiment and simulation. [22]. We explain this striking effect by a two-stage\nrelaxation process of the small particles which are first\nexcluded from the triangular crystallites regions of the\nbig ones. Concomitantly they show a strong correlation\nsince they are compressed until the total system relaxes\nback to a state where the small particle optimize their\ncorrelations in the network dictated by the big ones.\nThe energetic optimization to the final state is shown\nin Figure 4 revealing agreement between experiment and\nsimulation within the statistical inaccuracies.

(a)\nBrownian dynamics data, (b) experiments.\n\nhuge jump in the potential energy per particle immediately after the quench which then relaxes quickly towards\na transient state. Then, on a second time scale, we find\na slower relaxation process accompanied by a structural\nordering as can be seen in the corresponding experimental snapshots right before and after the instantaneous\nquench (see inset of fig. 4).\n\ngood agreement with Brownian dynamics computer simulations.\nOur real-space characterization allows to identify the\npathways of relaxation into a quenched glassy phase. As\nthe quench is ultra-fast, the dynamical pathways are not\nblurred by an additional time-scale from the quench history. The built-up and the fluctuations of local crystallites after the quench can be directly followed. Therefore our analysis can help in a more fundamental way to\nunderstand the interplay between vitrification and crystallization [11]. In fact, the structural heterogeneities\ndetected here give a considerable weight to concomitant\ndynamical heterogeneities [15, 16] and therefore represent\na relevant contribution to the dynamically heterogeneity\nof glasses [17, 18]. Finally, our results may also be useful\nto identify pathways of defect annealing in the crystalline\nphase [19, 20, 21].\nAcknowledgments: We thank Patrick Dillmann for\nhelpful discussions.

Brownian dynamics\nsimulation data are shown in red, experimental data in green.\nFor a better comparison the jump after the quench is truncated (see the cut in the y-axis). The inset is an expanded\nview. Corresponding experimental snapshots are shown before the quench at t/\u03c4 = 0\u2212 on the left side and after the\nquench at t/\u03c4 = 80 on the right side. Big particles are shown\nin white while small particles are presented as yellow spheres.\n\nIn conclusion, we have realized an ultra-fast quench in\ntwo-dimensional colloidal mixtures from a weakly interacting to a strongly interacting situation by a sudden increase of an external magnetic field which controls the interparticle repulsion. The system spontaneously relaxes\nby exhibiting structural inhomogeneities which reflect the\nunderlying stable crystal and correlate with slower regions in the dynamics.
