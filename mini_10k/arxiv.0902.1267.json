A\ncanonical basis, in other words, an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors for F will simplify the computation\nof the DFT. The main difficulty to get such a canonical basis is that F is an operator of order 4, and it\nhas four distinct eigenvalues \u00b11, \u00b1i with large multiplicity if the dimension N > 4. The multiplicity of\nthese eigenvalues depends on the value of n modulo 4, and was solved in [13], although it was later shown\nto have been equivalent to a problem solved by Gauss in [5].

This approach introduces the Weil representation [17] of the finite symplectic group Sp = SL2 (Fp ) (will be precisely\ndefined in Section 2) as the fundamental object of underlying harmonic analysis in the finite setting.\nMore precisely, a centralizer subgroup of the DFT operator F in U (H) (see definition in Section 2) is\neffectively described by using the Weil representation, which in this setting is a unitary representation\n\u03c1 : SL2 (Fp ) \u2192 U (H) and the DFT is proportional to a single operator \u03c1(w) where w \u2208 SL2 (Fp ).\nThe centralizer subgroup of w is Tw which is a maximal algebraic torus (i.e., maximal commutative\nsubgroup) in SL2 (Fp ). Then F commutes with \u03c1(Tw ), and they share the same eigenvectors.\nBy the above approach, a canonical basis \u03a6p of eigenvectors of the DFT and the transition matrix\n\u0398p from the standard basis to \u03a6p (discrete oscillator transform) for p \u2261 1 (mod 4) were described by\nan algorithm in [9]. However, this algorithm has heavy computation cost, and the analytical formulas\nof eigenvectors of the Fourier matrix F were unknown.\nThe vectors associated to the tori share many nice properties (see [6] [7] [8] for recent applications)\nand a simple analytical formula for the vectors associated to split tori was given in [16]. Based on [9] and\n[16], in this paper, an analytical formula of the canonical basis of the DFT for the case of p \u2261 1 (mod\n4) is given in Theorem 3, and their respective corresponding eigenvalues are determined in Theorem\n4. Then the discrete oscillator transform \u0398p introduced in [9] can be obtained in a straightforward\nmanner.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the definitions of the one\ndimensional finite Heisenberg and Weil representations and the approach studying the eigenvectors of\nthe DFT exhibited in [9]. Then in Section 3, we give an analytical formula of the canonical basis of the\nDFT, and determine their respective corresponding eigenvalues.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nFirst, we introduce some basic concepts and notations which are frequently used in this paper.\n- For a given prime p, let \u03b8 and \u03b7 denote the (p \u2212 1)th and pth primitive roots of unity in complex\nfield respectively, i.e.,\n\u03b8 = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0i\np\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nand \u03b7 = exp\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0i\np\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n- We denote Fp as the finite field with p elements, and F\u2217p = Fp \\{0} as the multiplicative group of\nFp with a generator a. Then for every element b \u2208 F\u2217p , there exist i with 0 6 i 6 p \u2212 2, such that\n2\n\n\fb = ai . In other words, i = loga b.\n- SL2 (Fp ) is the 2-dimensional special linear group over Fp consisting of all the 2 \u00d7 2 matrices\n!\na b\nsuch that ad \u2212 bc = 1 where a, b, c, d \u2208 Fp .\nc d\n- Let H = C(Fp ) which is the p-dimensional Hilbert space containing all the function from Fp to C\nwith the standard inner product, and U (H) be the group of unitary operators on H.\n- A unitary representation of a group G on the Hilbert space H is a homomorphism \u03c1 : G \u2192 U (H)\nwhich satisfies \u03c1(g * h) = \u03c1(g) * \u03c1(h) for \u2200g, h \u2208 G. Specially, if G is an Abelian group, its\nrepresentation \u03c1 can be decomposed into a direct sum of 1-dimensional representation (character).\n\n2.1\n\nThe Heisenberg Representation\n\nLet (V, \u03c9) be a two-dimensional symplectic vector space over the finite field Fp . For \u2200(ti , wi ) \u2208 V =\nFp \u00d7 Fp (i = 1, 2), the symplectic form \u03c9 is given by\n\u03c9((t1 , w1 ), (t2 , w2 )) = t1 w2 \u2212 t2 w1 .\nConsidering V as an Abelian group, it admits a non-trivial central extension called the Heisenberg group\nH. The group H can be presented as H = V \u00d7 Fp with the multiplication given by\n(t1 , w1 , z1 ) * (t2 , w2 , z2 ) = (t1 + t2 , w1 + w2 , z1 + z2 + 2\u22121 \u03c9((t1 , w1 ), (t2 , w2 ))).\nIt is easy to verify the center of H is Z = Z(H) = {g \u2208 H : gH = Hg} = {(0, 0, z) : z \u2208 Fp }.\nFor a given non-trivial one dimensional representation \u03c6 of the center Z, the Heisenberg group H\nadmits a unique irreducible representation of H.\nTheorem 1 (Stone-Von Neuman) Up to isomorphism, there exists a unique irreducible unitary representation \u03c0 : H \u2192 U (H) with central character \u03c6, that is, \u03c0|Z = \u03c6 * IdH .\nThe representation \u03c0 which appears in the above theorem is called the Heisenberg representation. In\nthis paper, we take one dimensional representation of Z as \u03c6((0, 0, z)) = \u03b7 z . Then the unique irreducible\nunitary representation \u03c0 corresponding to \u03c6 has the following formula\n\u03c0(t, w, z)[\u03c6](i) = \u03b7 2\n\n\u22121\n\nfor \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 H, (t, w, z) \u2208 H.\n\n3\n\ntw+z+wi\n\n\u03c6(i + t)\n\n(1)\n\n\f2.2\n\nThe Weil Representation\n\nThe symplectic group Sp = Sp(V, \u03c9), which is isomorphic to SL2 (Fp ), acts by automorphism of H\n!\na b\nthrough its action on the V -coordinate, i.e., for \u2200(t, w, z) \u2208 H and a matrix g =\n\u2208 SL2 (Fp ),\nc d\nthe action g on (t, w, z) is defined as\ng * (t, w, z) = (at + bw, ct + dw, z).\n\n(2)\n\nLet GL(H) be the p\u2212dimensional general linear group over C, and P GL(H) be the projective general\nlinear group where P GL(H) = GL(H)/C\u2217 . Due to Weil [17], a projective unitary representation\n\u03c1e : SL2 (Fp ) \u2192 P GL(H) is constructed as follows. Considering the Heisenberg representation \u03c0 :\n\nH \u2192 U (H) and \u2200g \u2208 SL2 (Fp ), a new representation is define as: \u03c0 g : H \u2192 U (H) by \u03c0 g (h) = \u03c0(g(h)).\n\nBecause both \u03c0 and \u03c0 g have the same central character \u03c6, they are isomorphic by Theorem 1. By Schur's\nLemma [14], HomH (\u03c0,\u03c0 g )\u223c\n= C\u2217 , so there exist a projective representation \u03c1e : SL2 (Fp ) \u2192 P GL(H). This\nprojective representation \u03c1e is characterized by the formula:\n\n\u03c1e(g)\u03c0(h)e\n\u03c1(g \u22121 ) = \u03c0(g(h))\n\n(3)\n\nfor every g \u2208 SL2 (Fp ) and h \u2208 H. A more delicate statement is that there exists a unique lifting of \u03c1e\ninto a unitary representation.\n\nTheorem 2 The projective Weil representation uniquely lifts to a unitary representation\n\u03c1 : SL2 (Fp ) \u2192 U (H)\nthat satisfies equation (3).\nThe existence of \u03c1 follows from the fact [3] that any projective representation of SL2 (Fp ) can be\nlifted to an honest representation, while the uniqueness of \u03c1 follows from the fact [9] that the group\nSL2 (Fp ) has no non-trivial characters when p 6= 3.\nNote that SL2 (Fp ) can be generated by ga =\n\na\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\u22121\n\n!\n\n, gb =\n\n1 0\nb\n\n1\n\n!\n\n, and w =\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u22121 0\n\n!\n\nwhere a \u2208 F\u2217p , b \u2208 Fp . The formulae of their respective Weil representations for ga , gb and w are given\nin [7] as follows\n\u03c1(ga )[\u03c6](i) = \u03c3(a)\u03c6(a\u22121 i)\n\u03c1(gb )[\u03c6](i) = \u03b7 \u22122\n\n\u22121\n\nbi2\n\n\u03c6(i)\n\n1 X ji\n\u03b7 \u03c6(i)\n\u03c1(w)[\u03c6](j) = \u221a\np\ni\u2208Fp\n\n4\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\fwhere \u03c3 : F\u2217p \u2192 {\u00b11} is the Legendre character, i.e., \u03c3(a) = a\n\np\u22121\n2\n\nin Fp .\n\nObviously, \u03c1(w) = F which is the DFT, and we denote \u03c1(ga ) = Sa , \u03c1(gb ) = Nb for convenience.

Maximal Algebraic Tori and Tw\nA maximal algebraic torus [2] in SL2 (Fp ) is a maximal commutative subgroup which becomes\ndiagonalizable over the original field or quadratic extension of the field. There are two classes of tori in\nSL2 (Fp ). The first class, called split tori, consists of those tori which are diagonalizable over Fp , while\nthe second class, called non-split tori, consists of those tori which are not diagonalizable over Fp , but\nbecome diagonalizable over the quadratic extension Fp2 .\nTw = {g : gw = wg, g \u2208 SL2 (Fp )} is the centralizer group of w in SL2 (Fp ). It is easy to verify\nTw =\n\n(\n\na\n\n\u2212b\n\nb\n\na\n\n!\n\n2\n\n2\n\n: a + b = 1, a, b \u2208 Fp\n\n)\n\n.\n\nIf p \u2261 1 (mod 4), then Tw is a split torus and conjugates to the standard diagonal torus\nA=\n\n(\n\na\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\u22121\n5\n\n!\n\n:a\u2208\n\nF\u2217p\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\n\fSo Tw is a cyclic subgroup of SL2 (Fp ) with order p \u2212 1. If p \u2261 3 (mod 4), Tw is a non-split torus which\nis a cyclic subgroup of SL2 (Fp ) with order p + 1.\nB. Decomposition of Weil representation Associated with Tw\nBecause Tw is a cyclic group, restricting the Weil representation to Tw : \u03c1|Tw : Tw \u2192 U (H), we obtain\na 1-dimensional subrepresentation decomposition of \u03c1|Tw corresponding to an orthogonal decomposition\nof H(see [14] for basics of group representation theory). In other words,\n\u03c1|Tw =\n\nM\n\n\u03c7\n\n\u03c7\u2208\u039bTw\n\nand H =\n\nM\n\n\u03c7\u2208\u039bTw\n\nH\u03c7\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u039bTw is a collection of all the 1-dimensional subrepresentation (character) \u03c7 : Tw \u2192 C in the\ndecomposition of Weil representation restricted to Tw .\nIf p \u2261 1 (mod 4), \u03c7 is the character given by \u03c7 : Zp\u22121 \u2192 C. We have dimH\u03c7 = 1 unless \u03c7 = \u03c3\nwhere \u03c3 is the Legendre character of T , and dimH\u03c3 = 2. If p \u2261 3 (mod 4), \u03c7 is the character given by\n\u03c7 : Zp+1 \u2192 C. There is only one character which does not appear in the decomposition. For the other\np characters \u03c7 which appear in the decomposition, we have dimH\u03c7 = 1.\nChoosing a generator t \u2208 Tw , the character is generated by the eigenvalue \u03c7(t) of the linear operator\n\u03c1(t), and the character space H\u03c7 naturally corresponds to the eigenspace of \u03c7(t). Because the eigenvalues\nof \u03c1(t) are almost different, it is easier to find a basis of orthogonal eigenvectors of \u03c1(t) than of the\nDFT. Since \u03c1(t) commutes with the DFT, the eigenvectors of \u03c1(t) are also the eigenvectors of the DFT.\nThus, we obtain a canonical basis of the DFT.\n\n3\n\nA Canonical Basis of the DFT\n\nIf p \u2261 1 (mod 4), Tw is a torus conjugating to the standard diagonal torus A =\nso t, which is a generator of Tw , conjugates to ga =\n\na\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\u22121\n\n!\n\n(\n\na\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\u22121\n\n!\n\n:a\u2208\n\nF\u2217p\n\n)\n\n,\n\nwhere a is a generator of F\u2217p , i.e., there\n\nexist s \u2208 SL2 (Fp ), such that t = sga s\u22121 and \u03c1(t) = \u03c1(s)\u03c1(ga )\u03c1(s\u22121 ). Thus, the eigenvectors of \u03c1(t) can\nbe determined by \u03c1(s) and the eigenvectors of \u03c1(ga ). In the following, we first present the results, then\ntheir proofs follow.\n\nLemma 1 Let ga =\n\na\n\n0\n\n0\n\na\u22121\n\n!\n\nwhere a is a generator of F\u2217p , then {\u03c8x = {\u03c8x (i)}06i<p : 0 6 x < p}\n\n6\n\n\fwhere\n\n\u03c80 (i) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1, f or i = 0\n\n\uf8f3 0, f or i 6= 0\n\nand \u03c8x (i) =\n\n\uf8f1 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nf or i = 0\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u221a 1 \u03b8x loga i , f or i 6= 0\np\u22121\n\nf or 0 < x < p\n\nis an orthonormal basis of H and a collection of the eigenvectors of \u03c1(ga ).\nLemma 2 Let s =\n\n1\n\n2\u22121 ak\n\nak\n\n2\u22121\n\n!\n\nwhere k =\n\np\u22121\n4 ,\n\nthen t = sga s\u22121 is a generator of Tw .\n\nThus \u03a6p = {\u03c6x : \u03c6x = \u03c1(s)\u03c8x , 0 6 x < p} is a canonical basis of \u03c1(t) = \u03c1(sga s\u22121 ) and the DFT.\nMore explicitly,\nTheorem 3 Let\n\n\u03c6x (i) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n1 \u22121 k 2\n\u221a \u03b72 a i ,\np\n\nf or x = 0\n\np\u22121\n\uf8f4\nX\nk\n2\n\u22121 k 2\n\uf8f4\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\np\n\u03b8x loga j \u03b7 a (j\u2212i) \u22122 a i , f or 0 < x < p.\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 p(p \u2212 1)\nj=1\n\nThen \u03a6p = {\u03c6x = {\u03c6x (i)}06i<p : 0 6 x < p} is an orthonormal basis of H and a collection of the\neigenvectors of the DFT.\nTheorem 4 \u03c6x (0 6 x < p) is the eigenvector of the DFT corresponding to the eigenvalue (\u2212i)x where\n\u221a\ni = \u22121, i.e.,\nF \u03c6x = (\u2212i)x \u03c6x .\n\nNow we prove the above lemmas and theorems. Considering {\u03b4i : i \u2208 Fp } which is the orthonormal\nbasis of Hilbert space H = C(Fp ), where \u03b4i is defined as \u03b4i (j) = \u03b4ij for \u2200i, j \u2208 Fp , every vector\nP\n\u03c6 = {\u03c6(i)} can be written as the form \u03c6 = i\u2208Fp \u03c6(i)\u03b4i . Recall that SL2 (Fp ) can be generated by\n!\n!\n!\na\n0\n1 0\n0 1\nga =\n, gb =\nand w =\nwhere a \u2208 F\u2217p and b \u2208 Fp .

From (11), we have\n\u03c1(ga )\u03b4i = \u03c3(a)\u03b4ai = \u2212\u03b4ai .\nLet V1 = V (\u03b41 ), V2 = V (\u03b42 , \u03b43 , * * * , \u03b4p\u22121 ), then it is obvious that H = V1\n\nL\n\nV2 , < V1 , V2 >= 0, and\n\n\u03c1(ga )(Vi ) = Vi for i = 1, 2. It is easy to see that \u03c1(ga )|V1 = \u2212Id, so \u03b40 is a eigenvector of \u03c1(ga )\ncorresponding to the eigenvalue \u22121. The eigenfunction of \u03c1(ga )|V2 is (xp\u22121 \u2212 1), so the eigenvalues\nPp\u22121 ( p\u22121 \u2212j) log i\na \u03b4\n2\nof \u03c1(ga )|V2 are \u03b80 , \u03b81 , \u03b82 , * * * , \u03b8p\u22122 which are different. We assert that\ni is the\ni=1 \u03b8\n\neigenvector associated to the eigenvalue \u03b8j (0 6 j 6 p \u2212 2), and it can be verified as follows\np\u22121\nX p\u22121\n\u03b8( 2 \u2212j) loga i \u03b4i ) =\n\u03c1(ga )(\ni=1\n\n=\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n\u2212\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8(\n\np\u22121\n2 \u2212j) loga\n\n\u03b8(\n\np\u22121\n\u22121\ni)\n2 \u2212j) loga (a\n\ni\n\n\u03b4ai\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b4i\n\ni=1\n\np\u22121\n2\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b8(\n\np\u22121\n2 \u2212j)(loga\n\ni\u22121)\n\n\u03b4i\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\n\u03b8\n\np\u22121\n2\n\n\u03b8j\u2212\n\np\u22121\n2\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b8(\n\np\u22121\n2 \u2212j) loga\n\ni\n\n\u03b4i\n\ni=1\n\n=\n\n\u03b8\n\nj\n\np\u22121\nX\n\n\u03b8(\n\np\u22121\n2 \u2212j) loga\n\ni\n\n\u03b4i .\n\ni=1\n\nLet x =\n\nq\u22121\n2\n\n\u2212 j.
