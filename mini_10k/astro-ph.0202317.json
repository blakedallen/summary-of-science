Introduction\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that galaxies are dynamic\necosystems. Especially important in shaping the structure\nand evolution of galaxies are high-energy activities that\ncan generate high-velocity and high-temperature gas. We\nhave been carrying out a systematic observing program\nto gain various perspectives of high-energy phenomena\n\nthe GC region of the Milky Way may play an important\nrole in supplying the hot gas (Wang 1997; Almy et al.\n2000; Sofue 2000).\nWhile the massive black hole at the dynamic center\nof our Galaxy is not particularly active at present (e.g.,\nBaganoff et al. 2001), enhanced X-ray emission has been\nobserved in the surrounding region (e.g., Koyama et al.\n1996; Wang et al. 2002). The presence of various spectral\nlines (e.g., 6.7-keV Fe XXV K\u03b1), as detected by ASCA,\nhas been taken as an indication for large amounts of very\nhot diffuse gas (\u223c 108 K; Koyama et al. 1996). Such hot\ngas cannot be confined by the gravity of the region and is\nlikely to escape.\n\nProc.

ROSAT all sky survey map of the inner region of\nthe Galaxy in the \u223c 1.5 keV band (Snowden et al. 1997).\nThe box in the middle marks the region covered by ROSAT\npointed observations (Fig. 2).\nFigure 2. A close-up of the central region of the Galaxy. The\nmosaic is constructed with ROSAT PSPC observations (Sidoli\net al. 2001) in the highest energy band (1.5\u20132.4 keV; Snowden\net al. 1997). The central rectangular box oriented along the\nGalactic plane outlines the field mapped out by our Chandra\nsurvey (Fig. 3).\n\nThe outflow of the hot gas from the GC region may be\nresponsible for much of the diffuse soft X-ray background,\nparticularly in the inner field of the Galaxy. Fig. 1 shows a\nlarge-scale hollow-cone-shaped soft X-ray feature on each\nside of the Galactic plane. This distinct morphology resembles those seen in nearby galaxies with active nuclear\nstar formation and suggests a hot gas outflow from the GC\nregion of the Milky Way. A close-up of the region, as presented in Fig. 2, further shows a bright soft X-ray plume\nthat apparently connects to the southern large-scale Xray feature, >\n\u223c 300 pc away from the Galactic plane at\nthe distance of the GC (Fig. 1). The exact morphology of\nthis plume is uncertain, because of the differential X-ray\nabsorption across the field. A comparison of the ROSAT\nPSPC and IRAS 100 micron images suggests that the\ndeficit of the soft X-ray emission between the plume and\nthe circumnuclear region is most likely due to X-ray shadowing by foreground interstellar dusty gas. There might\nalso be outflows from other adjacent massive star forming regions. But the plume just below the GC is the most\nprominent and coherent vertical diffuse soft X-ray feature\nobserved, and it may represent the hot gas outflow from\nthe GC region to the southern halo of the Galaxy.\n3. Chandra Survey of the Galactic Center\nWe have carried out a Chandra survey of the Galactic\nridge around the GC (Fig. 3; Wang et al. 2002). This\nsurvey consists of 30 separate observations, which were\nall taken in July 2001. A mosaic of these observations,\nincluding only the data from the ACIS-I, covers a field\nof \u223c 0.8\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 . The survey data provide an invaluable\ndatabase for studying the interplay between stars, gas,\ndust, gravity, and magnetic fields in the unique environment of the center region.\n3.1. Discrete sources and Features\nOur preliminary analysis of the survey data, together with\nthree deeper archival observations, has led a detection of\nabout 1000 discrete sources (Wang et al. 2002). Less than\n20 of these sources are previously known objects, most\nof which are bright X-ray binaries. The newly-detected\n\nsources must represent a combination of various populations, including background AGNs and foreground stars\nas well as X-ray binaries (CVs, accreting neutron star and\nblack hole systems) and massive stars in the GC region,\nalthough their relative populations in the field are still\nvery much uncertain.\nThe number of the detected X-ray sources in our field\nseems to be much higher than that expected from a measurement of the source density in a relatively blank region\nof the Galactic plane (Ebisawa et al. 2001). But, we are\nyet to quantify this source excess, taking into consideration such position-dependent parameters as the detection\nthreshold, the line-of-sight X-ray absorption, and the local\ndiffuse X-ray background level. The X-ray absorption, for\nexample, clearly varies across the field, affecting the surface brightness distribution, particularly in the 1\u20133 keV\nenergy band. The majority of the detected sources are in\nthe energy range of 2\u201310 keV within a luminosity range of\n1032 \u2212 1035 ergs s\u22121 at the distance of the GC.\n\nFigure 4. Comparison of accumulated source (lower) and\ndiffuse X-ray emission (upper) spectra for the central enhancement above the surrounding background (see text).\nFig. 4 compares the accumulated X-ray spectra of source\nand diffuse components in the central region. These two\nspectra are extracted from an ellipse (with the major and\nminor axis equal to 50\u2032 and 12\u2032 ), centered on the Sgr A\u2217\nand oriented along the Galactic plane. Regions around\nthe two brightest sources (1E 1740.7-2942 and 1E 1743.12843) are excluded to minimize the spectral pile-up problem. A diffuse background, obtained in the outer field and\nnormalized in both exposure and area, is subtracted from\nthe two spectra. However, the X-ray surface brightness\ndistribution varies strongly across the field, especially in\nthe region close to Sgr A. Therefore, the above simple subtraction may still leave a considerable diffuse X-ray contribution (e.g., line emission) to the discrete source spectrum\nin Fig. 4.\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 3. Chandra ACIS-I intensity map of the Galactic central ridge. This map, constructed in the 1\u20138 keV range,\nis adaptively smoothed with a signal-to-noise ratio of \u223c 3 and is plotted logarithmically to emphasize low surface\nbrightness emission. The saw-shaped boundaries of the map, plotted in Galactic coordinates, results from a specific roll\nangle of the observations.\nFigure 5. Galactic center region across the spectrum: red: radio 90 cm (VLA; LaRosa et al. 2001); green: mid-infrared\n(MSX; Price et al. 2001); blue: X-ray (1\u20138 keV; Fig. 3)\nThe total count rate from the detected discrete sources\nis comparable to that of the diffuse emission. But excluding the two brightest sources, the source contribution is only \u223c 20% of the diffuse emission from the central enhancement. Including the subtracted X-ray background radiation, which is still uncertain, this fraction\nwould be smaller. No known source population with Lx <\n1032 ergs s\u22121 could explain the diffuse hard X-ray emission as observed.\nOur ongoing study of the X-ray spatial, spectral, and\ntiming properties as well as counterparts in other wavelength bands will help us to constrain the nature of individual sources. Here I describe two examples of interesting\nX-ray sources and features that we have been studying.\n\nthe positions of bright near-infrared stars, which typically\nhave strong stellar winds (e.g., Cotera et al. 1996). Alternatively, the X-ray sources may represent emission peaks\nof the so-called cluster wind formed from the thermalization of colliding winds from a collection of individual stars\n(Raga et al. 2001).\nBut the diffuse X-ray emission from the vicinity of the\ncluster clearly has a different origin. The X-ray spectrum\nof the emission shows a strong 6.4-keV line with an equivalent width of \u223c 1 keV (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2002). We find\nthat this K\u03b1 emission of neutral to moderately-ionized\nirons is spatially correlated with a dense molecular cloud\nobserved in the region. Therefore, the diffuse X-ray emission may primarily represent the scattered X-ray radiation\nfrom the cluster.\n\n3.1.1. Arches cluster and its vicinity\n3.1.2. Nonthermal Radio Filament\n\nFigure 6. ACIS-I 1\u20137 keV intensity contours overlaid on the HST NICMOS 1.6 micro image of the\nArches cluster (Figer et al. 1999). The contours are\nat 26, 32, 44, 68, 120, 220, 420, 820, and 1620\n\u00d710\u22123 counts s\u22121 arcmin\u22122 .\n\nThe Arches cluster is the most compact massive star\ncluster known in our Galaxy. The cluster was covered by\none of our survey observations in a position that is significantly closer to the telescope axis than the Chandra\nCycle 1 image presented by Yusef-Zadeh et al. (2002). We\nfind that the X-ray emission from the cluster consists of\nat least three discrete sources (Fig. 6); the apparently extended northern source, for example, may contain multiple point-like components and/or a substantial amount\nof enhanced diffuse emission in the vicinity. The spectra\nof these sources show the prominent K\u03b1 emission lines of\nhighly-ionized ions such as S XV, Ar XVII, Ca XIX and Fe\nXXV and are characterized by a two-temperature thermal\nplasma model of kT \u223c 1 and 6 keV. Each source has an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of \u223c 1035 ergs s\u22121 in the 0.2\u2013\n10 keV band. Portegies Zwart et al. (2001) have argued\nthat such high-luminosity X-ray sources may still represent colliding wind binaries of extremely massive stars.\nHowever, the centroids of the X-ray sources don't match\n\nFigure 7. X-ray contours overlaid on a 4.5 GHz radio continuum image of NTF G359.54+0.18 (Yusef-Zadeh 1997).\nThe brightest point-like X-ray source in the field matches\nwell spatially with a radio source.\n\nOne of the most unique high-energy phenomena observed in the GC region is the presence of numerous nonthermal filaments (NTFs) of radio emission (Fig. 5). While\nthe origin of these filaments remains largely unknown,\nfinding an X-ray counterpart can provide important constraints on the particle energetics. We show in Fig. 7 a\nconvincing association of an X-ray \"thread\" with NTF\nG359.54+0.18. This X-ray thread is about 1\u2032 long and has\na width that is not adequately resolved on scales of \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 .\nInterestingly, the X-ray emission is associated with the\nbrightest of the two nearly parallel radio filaments and\nappears to have a flat spectrum, consistent with a nonthermal nature of the thread.\n3.2. Large-scale diffuse X-ray emission\nThe high spatial resolution of the Chandra observations\nenables us, for the first time, to measure the diffuse Xray component in the GC region with little contamination\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 8. Diffuse X-ray emission across the X-ray spectrum: Red - 1\u20133 keV; Green - 3\u20135 keV; Blue - 5\u20138 keV.\nSource regions are replaced with interpolated values from surrounding regions. The resultant artifacts are apparent in\nregions around the two brightest sources 1E 1740.7-2942 and 1E 1743.1-2843. The images are adaptively smoothed\nwith a Gaussian function to achieve a local count-to-noise ratio of \u223c 8; much of the small-scale fluctuations is due to\nthe Poisson noise.\nfrom discrete sources (Fig. 8). The presence of prominent\nline emission from ions such as S XV, Ar XVII, and Ca\nXIX (Fig. 4) in the diffuse X-ray spectrum indicates the\npresence\nof gas at temperatures of \u223c 107 K. The intensity image\nin the 1\u20133 keV band (Fig. 8), for example, is dominated\nby the line emission (Fig. 4), which traces the diffuse hot\ngas component. The emission is greatly enhanced in the\nrecent star forming region close to Sgr A and the Radio Arc, where heating sources are abundant. The fast\nstellar winds from the three known young massive clusters alone (Galactic center, Arches, and Quintuplet; Figer\net al. 1999), for example, account for a mechanical energy\ndeposit of order 1039 ergs s\u22121 , comparable to that from\nthe central cluster of the 30 Doradus nebula in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (Wang 1999). The detectable lifetime of\nsuch clusters against the background star density is only\na few megayears because of the strong gravitational tidal\nfield in the GC region (Portegies Zwart et al. 2002). Therefore, the region may contain a lot of massive stars, which\nwill end their life as supernovae, heating the ISM.\n\nFigure 9. 6.4-keV line intensity contours overlaid on the\nHCN J = 1 \u2192 0 emission (Jackson et al. 1996) from the\ncentral region of the Galaxy. The X-ray image is adaptively\nsmoothed with a signal-to-noise ratio of \u223c 3, after discrete\nsources with count rates greater than 10\u22123 counts s\u22121 have\nbeen excised. A continuum contribution, estimated in the\n4\u20136 keV and 7\u20139 keV bands, is subtracted.\nHowever, the overall spectrum of the diffuse X-ray\nemission (Fig. 4) appears substantially harder than expected for the thermal component alone. In fact, Fig. 8\nshows that the observed X-rays in different energy bands\noften arise in different regions, indicating different origins.\nThe prominent 6.4-keV line emission, for example, is probably not related directly to the thermal component. Part\nof the line emission is likely due to the fluorescent radiation from discrete sources, as in the case of the Arches cluster. Alternatively, the emission may be produced by the\nfilling of K-shell vacancies produced by low-energy cosmic\nrays (Valinia et al. 2000). For both scenarios, one might\nexpect a good correlation between the 6.4-keV emission\nand dense molecular gas tracers. However, such a correlation appears only globally, not on scales smaller than a\nfew arcminutes (e.g., Fig. 9). This may indicate that the\n\n6.4-keV emission is strongly influenced by local sources of\nhard X-ray radiation and/or low-energy cosmic rays.\nFurthermore, we find that the emission distribution in\nthe 4\u20136 keV band, where no prominent emission line is\npresent, is substantially different from those of the above\ntwo emission lines, although differences in X-ray absorption are yet to be carefully considered. Most likely, the 4\u20136\nkeV band emission represents a combination of the thermal hot gas, scattered discrete source emission, and radiation from additional processes such as bremsstrahlung of\nnonthermal cosmic-ray electrons. The lack of enhanced Xray emission from some of the most prominent nonthermal\nradio filaments and mid-infrared features indicates that\nthe inverse Compton scattering of the cosmic microwave\nbackground or the interstellar infrared radiation is not a\nsignificant contributor to the observed diffuse X-ray emission.\nVarious radio studies have shown a global vertical configuration of inter-cloud magnetic fields, which extend to\nat least a few hundreds of pc away from the Galactic plane\n(e.g., LaRosa et al. 2000 and references therein). This configuration could result from vertical outflows of magnetized materials from the circumnuclear region (e.g., Wang\net al. 2001). Indeed, the diffuse X-ray emission appears\nto extend beyond our surveyed field (Fig. 8). The outflow\nof the hot plasma and relativistic particles from the GC\nregion may also be responsible for larger scale diffuse radio and soft X-ray features seen in the inner region of the\nGalaxy (Wang 1997; Almy et al. 2000; Sofue 2000).\n\nFigure 10. NGC 4631 as seen edge-on from the Chandra\nACIS-S in the 0.3\u20131.5 keV band (shown in blue and purple\ncolor) and Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (orange), tracing\nmassive stars in the galaxy.\n\nFigure 11. Central region of NGC 4631 in the Chandra\nACIS-S 0.3\u20130.9 keV band (shown in blue and purple\ncolor), compared with a Hubble WFPC-2 H\u03b1 image (orange).\n\n\f5\n\n4. Nearby Edge-on Galaxies\nThe best way to study the global galactic disk/halo interaction is to observe nearby edge-on galaxies. We have observed with the Chandra ACIS-S three nearby edge-on Scd\ngalaxies as listed in Table 1. These galaxies, which show\nonly little sign of nuclear starbursts, may be considered\nsimilar to our Galaxy in terms of morphology. Since they\nlie in directions of the sky with exceptionally low Galactic foreground absorption, they represent ideal cases to\nstudy their soft X-ray emission properties. Furthermore,\nwhile NGC 4631 is strongly interacting with a companion,\nNGC3556 is an isolated galaxy. The star forming rate in\nNGC 4244 is extremely low. The Chandra observations\nallow for comparison of the relative importance of galaxygalaxy interaction and internal galactic activity in generating extraplanar hot gas.\n\nFigure 12. Optical image with overlaid radio continuum\ncontours of NGC 3556 (King & Irwin 1997).\nWe find only marginal evidence for diffuse X-ray emission in either the disk or the halo of NGC 4244. Both\nNGC 4631 and NGC 3556 show substantial diffuse soft\nX-ray emission beyond stellar disks (Wang et al. 2001;\nFigs. 10\u201311; Figs. 12\u201313). These observations provide the\nfirst unambiguous evidence for galactic coronae around\ngalaxies that are similar to our Milky Way. The coronae\nmorphologically resemble the radio halos of the galaxies\n(e.g., Fig. 13; Wang et al. 1995; Wang et al. 2001). One\nscenario for this radio-X-ray connection is that hot gas\noutflows are accompanied by magnetic field and cosmic\nrays and are confined ultimately by magnetic field at large\ngalactic radius (Wang et al. 1995).\n\nFigure 13. NGC 3556 across the Chandra ACIS-S spectrum: Red - 0.3\u20131.5 keV; Green - 1.5\u20133 keV; Blue -\n3\u20137 keV. The radio contours are the same as in the previous figure.\ncomparison with our deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging (Fig. 11; Wang et al. 2001).\nExpanding large-scale shell-like HI structures have also\nbeen found in both NGC4631 and NGC 3556 (Rand &\nvan der Hulst 1993; King & Irwin 1997). These shells are\nvery energetic; each requires an energy input equivalent\n4\nto >\n\u223c 10 SNe. Their nature is still a mystery. The two\nshells found in NGC 4631 are apparently associated with\nmassive star forming regions, as traced by HII regions.\nThus, the energy may be provided by numerous SNe and\nstellar winds from massive stars. Indeed, we find that two\nX-ray emission peaks spatially coincide with the shells.\nThe peak associated with the eastern shell is extended\nand may represent hot gas within the shell. The X-ray\nemission from the western peak is, however, dominated\nby a bright point-like source, presumably an X-ray binary. Thus, high spatial resolution X-ray observations are\nessential for determining the nature of giant HI shells.\n\nFigure 14. Chandra ACIS-S image of NGC 4244 in the\n0.3\u20131.5 keV band. The contours outline the morphology of\nthe optical disk of the galaxy. The straight lines outline the\nboundaries of the X-ray data coverage.\nWe find that the two partial HI shells (the so-called\neastern and western features) identified by King & Irwin\n(1997) are not associated with any enhanced X-ray features. Therefore, these shells are probably not blown-out\nsuperbubbles produced by massive OB associations.\n\nTable 1.

Summary\nWhile our analysis of the Chandra observations described\nabove is still ongoing, I summarize some of the preliminary\nresults as follows:\n\u2013 We have obtained the first arcsecond-resolution X-ray\npanorama of the GC region, which allows for direct\ncomparison with similar maps in radio and infrared.\n\u2013 We have detected about 1,000 discrete X-ray sources in\nthe GC region. A substantial fraction of these sources\nare likely to be Galactic (e.g., massive stars and X-ray\nbinaries).\n\u2013 We find that the diffuse X-ray emission dominates over\nthe contribution from faint discrete sources. The spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission indicates the presence of large amounts of hot gas with temperatures of\n\u223c 107 K. This hot gas originates in recent massive star\n\n\f6\n\nforming regions and possibly in the central black hole\nitself. There is evidence that the hot gas is escaping\nthe regions into the Galactic halo. The outflow of the\nhot gas may be responsible for large-scale soft X-ray\nenhancements observed in the inner field of the Galaxy.\n\u2013 The fluorescence and reflection of the radiation from\ndiscrete sources may be important in explaining the\noverall hard spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission.\nOne example is the X-ray emission from the surrounding region of the Arches cluster. The filling of K-shell\nvacancies produced by non-relativistic cosmic-rays may\nalso be important in producing Fe K-shell vacancies.\n\u2013 We have detected a giant corona around the edge-on\ndisk galaxy NGC 4631 and a substantial diffuse extraplanar X-ray component in NGC 3556. The diffuse Xray morphology of these galaxies resembles their radio\nhalos, indicating a close connection between outflows\nof hot gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields from the\ngalactic disks.\n\u2013 The extraplanar diffuse X-ray-emitting gas evidently\noriginates in star forming regions. In particular, enhanced X-ray emission is apparently enclosed by numerous H\u03b1-emitting loops blistered out from the central disk of NGC 4631.\nReferences\nAlmy, R. C., McCammon, D.
