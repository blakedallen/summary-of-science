UBV or SDSS) or intermediate-band (uvby) photometric systems, especially when the stars can cover a range of metallicities\nand reddenings. However, simple spectroscopic observational and data reduction\ntechniques can yield accurate values for log g through comparison of the Balmer\njumps of low-resolution spectra with recent grids of synthetic flux spectra.\nSubject headings: techniques: spectroscopic - stars: atmospheres - stars: fundamental parameters (temperatures, gravities) -stars: late-type - stars: Population II\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe abundance analyses of the oldest stars in the galaxy are of great importance to\nunderstand which elements were created during the life and death of the first generation of\nstars and how the fraction of heavy elements built up through the evolution of subsequent\ngenerations of stars. The effective temperature is the most important stellar atmosphere\nparameter to assign in the determination of abundances, but for those elements only represented by lines of the neutral species, it is necessary to establish the electron pressure or the\neffective gravity of the star. This is because hotter than about 4500K most of the heavy elements are once ionised and significant corrections are required to determine the total element\nabundances from the neutral species. Theoretical isochrones for a range of metallicities and\nages are readily available (Pietrinferni et al. 2006; VandenBerg 2000; Salasnich et al. 2000)\nand the normal log (L/L\u2299 ) versus log Te relations can be readily transformed to log g versus\nTe (log g = 4log Te - log(L/L\u2299 ) - 10.608).\nFig. 1 shows a typical halo isochone for age 12 Gyr. For old stars (age > 10 Gyr), the\nshape of the isochrone changes little as the main-sequence turn-off (TO) moves to cooler\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Isochrone from Pietrinferni et al. (2006) for 12 Gyrs.\ntemperatures with older age. As can be seen from the figure, for a given temperature, there\nare normally only three different possible values for log g for a halo star, depending on\nwhether the star is on the main-sequence (MS), on the subgiant/giant branch (SGB) or on\nthe horizontal branch (HB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB). Cooler than about 5500K it\nis generally quite easy to choose between a MS (log g = 5), a GB (log g = 3.5) and a HB\nstar (log g = 2.5) but near the MS turnoff the gravity differences are quite small and more\ndifficult to discern.\nThe Balmer discontinuity is an obvious feature to measure in the spectra of late-type\nhalo stars in order to determine log g. Blueward of 3636\u00c5 the continuous opacity is mainly\nH-, whereas redward it is H- plus HI. As log g (and log Pe ) decreases, the H- opacity decreases\nand the size of the Balmer discontinuity increases. But as the HI opacity decreases steeply\nwith decreasing temperature, the Balmer jump becomes less sensitive to changes in log g.\nAlthough low dispersion spectra are regularly taken of halo stars in order to measure\nthe HK lines of CaII and the H\u03b4 line for metallicity and temperature estimates, little or\nno effort is put into measuring the Balmer discontinuity. I think that there are three main\nreasons for this. Firstly, as the Balmer discontinuity is near the confluence of the hydrogen\nlines the continuum is changing rapidly and it seems impossible to uniquivocally extrapolate\na curved line that fits the continuum from the 4100\u00c5 to 4800\u00c5 region where the continuum\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nis well defined. Secondly, the sensitivity of most spectrographs and CCDs decreases rapidly\nbelow 3900\u00c5 leading many people to think there is little point in observing below 3600\u00c5.\nAnd finally, many think that it may be possible to overcome these difficulties only if a full\nrelative-absolute spectrophotometric calibration is undertaken and this seems like too much\neffort for uncertain return.\nThis paper aims to show how, with a minimal amount of extra effort at both the telescope\nand with the data reduction, the Balmer jump can be readily measured and compared with\nsimilar data from the detailed grid of synthetic spectra provided by Munari et al. (2005).\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nTechniques\n\nAtmospheric dispersion\n\nWhen doing ground-based spectroscopy in the UV/blue it is highly desirable that the\neffect of atmospheric dispersion is minimised either by using an atmospheric dispersion corrector (Filippenko 1982) or by rotating the spectrograph slit so that it is parallel to the\natmospheric dispersion. Otherwise, at large zenith distances, if the guider is centering the\ngreen or red image, a significant proportion of the UV/blue light will miss the slit. But, as\nthe Balmer jump is measured at one wavelength, it is not absolutely essential to measure the\nsame proportion of light at all wavelengths. However, although a reasonable discontinuity\nmay be measured under these circumstances, any possibility of measuring a temperature\nsensitive slope or color such as B-V is lost. If an atmospheric dispersion corrector is unavailable, spectra should be taken with the slit tracking the parallactic angle or the star should\nbe acquired in that mode and then observed with the position angle fixed to use an offset\nguide star in an alt-az telescope.\n\n2.2.\n\nDivision by black-body spectrum\n\nBessell (1999) discusses the advantages of observing smooth spectrum stars as part of\nany observing program. After the raw spectra have been extracted, the first step is to divide\nall spectra by the normalised spectrum of a star with a near-black-body energy distribution.\nThere are several near-continuous bright white dwarfs well suited for such division.\nThese are EG131 and L745-46a which are accessible in opposite seasons together with vMa2\nand two carbon-rich white dwarfs LHS 43 (Bessell 1999) and LHS 4043 (Dufour et al 2005).\nIt is necessary to remove the weak C2 bands from the carbon WDs and the CaII HK and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nMgI lines from L745-46a and vMa2, or fit a line through the continuum before division.\nGreenstein & Liebert (1990) and Bergeron et al. (2001) discuss the spectra of these stars\nwhile Koester & Wolff (2000) and Dufour et al (2005) discuss the theoretical fluxes of some\nof the stars.\nThere are two main reasons for dividing by a normalised near-BB spectrum. Firstly,\nin the red it removes most of the atmospheric (telluric) absorption lines and secondly, for\nboth blue and red spectra it removes most of the instrumental response due to vignetting,\ngrating blaze, filters, mirrors and CCD response. The net effect of this division is to provide\nspectra in which the continuum level changes slowly and smoothly with wavelength that in\nturn means the corrections (with wavelength) to place the fluxes on a relative absolute flux\nscale can be well fitted with a smooth low order polynomial or spline.\n\n2.3.\n\nLinearisation of the continuum\n\nAn unanticipated dividend of the division by a warm near-BB spectrum was the fact\nthat the continuum levels of FGK stars above and below the Balmer jump were transformed\nfrom curves into almost straight lines. This enables the continua to be extrapolated with\nconfidence to 3636\u00c5 and the Balmer jump measured accurately and consistently.\nDivision by EG131, black-body temperature about 11800K, straightens the continuum\nin stars with temperatures from 7500K to 5000K. Division by the cooler L745-46a (\u2248 8600K)\nleaves some residual curvature for spectra hotter than 6500K but is good for cooler stars.\nThe two carbon-rich white dwarfs LHS43 and LHS4043 have intermediate black-body temperatures to EG131 and L745-46a; vMa2 is cooler.\nFig. 2 shows examples of raw extracted blue spectra obtained with the Double Beam\nSpectrograph (DBS) on the ANU 2.3m telescope. The data has not been flat fielded. From\nthe top, are the white dwarf LHS43 and the halo stars G64-12 (sdF0; 6500K/4.0/-3.4), HD\n84937 (sdF5; 6200K/4.0/-2.3), G24-3 (sdF8; 5900K/4.2/-1.7), CD -38 245 (4800K/1.5/-4.1).\nThe bracketed quantities are the approximate stellar parameters of the stars. The spectra\nare offset by 0.2 divisions for clarity.\nFig. 3 shows the same raw spectra divided by the spectrum of EG131. The weak carbon\nbands in LHS43 and the Balmer jumps in the halo stars are much more obvious and easier\nto measure in the divided spectra.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 2.- Raw extracted blue 2.3m spectra. See text for details\n3.\n\nTheoretical fluxes- model synthetic spectra\n\nLine-blanketed fluxes are available for the ATLAS9 and MARCS grid of model atmospheres. The Munari et al. (2005) ATLAS9 synthetic spectra at 1\u00c5 resolution are particularly useful. The MARCS sampled photospheric fluxes, available on their website (http://marcs.astro.uu.se/\nare provided with a warning that they are not likely to give a good representation of the\nintegrated fluxes in a limited wavelength region. But they look adequate for the lowest\nmetallicities.\nFig. 4 shows Munari synthetic flambda spectra for an abundance of [Fe/H] = -2.5,\ntemperature 5750K and three different effective gravities. The spectra have been smoothed\nto 3\u00c5 resolution the same as the DBS data. The Balmer discontinuity at 3636\u00c5 can be seen,\nbut the slope of the continuum redward of this limit makes it difficult to measure it.\nThe synthetic spectra can also divided by a 11800K blackbody to measure the theoretical Balmer jumps more reliably. Fig. 5 are the same 5750K spectra divided by a 11800K\nblack-body. Fig. 6 to 10 show similarly divided Munari synthetic spectra for several more\ntemperatures and sets of gravities appropriate for main-sequence, giant-branch and horizontal or asymptotic giant branch stars. For each temperature plot, the divided spectra have\nbeen normalized at 5300\u00c5 and are plotted with equal offsets for better visibility. One can\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Same stars as in Fig.2 but divided by EG131.\ndraw straight lines through the continua on the various figures to see how linear the continua\nof the divided observed and synthetic spectra are and how well defined the Balmer jumps\nare, even when they are small.\n\n4.\n\nBalmer jump measurements\n4.1.\n\nTheoretical spectra\n\nThe model spectra were wavelength scrunched and then smoothed to approximate the\nobserved medium resolution spectra. The Munari spectra were smoothed to 5\u00c5 resolution,\nthe MARCS fluxes to 6\u00c5 resolution. All model spectra were divided by a 11800 black-body,\nplotted up and the Balmer jumps measured by hand as for the observed spectra. The size of\nthe Balmer jump in magnitudes are given in Table 1 and Table 2. The depth of the H\u03b4 line\nwas also measured as it is a good temperature indicator, but for comparison with observations\nit is necessary to carefully match the resolution whereas the Balmer jump measurement is\nnot as sensitive to the resolution.

There is good general agreement for the two grids, except for the coolest and strongest\nline spectra where as noted above, the MARCS sampled photospheric fluxes are not likely to give a\ngood representation of the integrated flux in a limited wavelength region. Full spectrum synthesis\nis needed for the MARCS models to properly compare them. However, both sets of theoretical\nspectra show that for temperatures above 5500K the Balmer jump can readily distinguish main\nsequence and subgiant branch stars, while for temperatures at around 5000K and 5250K, only\ngravities below log g=3.0 can be distinquished from log g=4.5 main sequence stars. Cooler than\n5000K the Balmer jump is virtually impossible to measure except in the most extreme metal-poor\nstars.\nThe model spectra show that the measured Balmer jump increases as the metallicity increases\ndue probably to the greater strength of metal-line blanketing in the UV than in the blue.\n\n4.2.\n\nObservations\n\nThere are several excellent spectral libraries that can be used for Balmer jump measurements\nand comparison with the models.

The stars whose Mv values differ significantly from their Balmer jumps are marked\nin Fig 12. The theoretical values for the Munari [Fe/H]=-1.5 and -2.5 spectra are also shown for\nlog g = 3.5, 4.0 and 4.5 and temperatures Te =6500K, 6250K, 6000K, 5750K, 5500K and 5250K.\nThe Balmer jumps from the synthetic spectra are in good agreement with the observed loci of\nmetal-poor stars. Precise derivation of the gravities of individual stars involves knowledge of the\nmetallicity and temperature (and the reddening if fluxes are used), which is beyond the scope of\nthis paper.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nDividing extracted raw spectra by the spectrum of a warm near-blackbody object such as\nEG131, L745-46a, LHS43 or LHS4043 results in spectra whose continua above and below the\nBalmer discontinuity are close to straight lines thus making it easy to measure the size of the\nBalmer jump accurately.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nThe recommendation is to observe a warm near-black-body star at least once a run for each\ngrating setting used then divide all extracted raw spectra by a template made from the normalised\nextracted blackbody spectrum by removing any obvious lines or bands it may have or fitting the\ncontinuum. In order to accurately measure the theoretical Balmer jumps from synthetic spectra\nsuch as those of Munari et al. (2005), it is also important to divide the synthetic spectra by the\nnormalised theoretical blackbody spectrum of similar black-body temperature to the template star\nused.\nHaving followed these recommendations and measured the Balmer jump, the effective gravity\ncan be derived from the model spectra. If the effective temperature of the FGK star is known to\nwithin 100K the Balmer jump will yield an effective gravity to about 0.2 dex for the hotter stars and\n0.5 dex for the cooler stars, sufficient precision to determine whether the star is a main-sequence,\ngiant branch or horizontal/asymptotic giant branch star.\nBest spectrophotometric results are achieved if an atmospheric dispersion corrector is used or\nif the spectrograph is rotated to put the parallactic angle along the slit. This is not essential to\nmeasure the monochromatic Balmer jump but it does ensure that the spectra can be accurately\ncalibrated onto a relative absolute flux scale and that other temperature sensitive colors can be\nderived.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nI am grateful to Dr Lajos Balazs, Director of Konkoly Observatory and Dr Katalin Olah for\ntheir hospitality during the writing of this paper.
