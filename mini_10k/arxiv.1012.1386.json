For Reeb vector fields on closed 3-manifolds, cylindrical contact\nhomology is used to show that the existence of a set of closed Reeb orbit with\ncertain knotting/linking properties implies the existence of other Reeb orbits\nwith other knotting/linking properties relative to the original set. We work\nout a few examples on the 3-sphere to illustrate the theory, and describe an\napplication to closed geodesics on S 2 (a version of a result of Angenent in\n[Ang05]).\n\n1. Introduction\nLet V be a closed 3-manifold with a contact form \u03bb and associated Reeb vector\nfield X\u03bb . In this article we will be concerned with the following question about\nclosed orbits:\nGeneral Question: If one has a Reeb vector field with a known\nset of closed Reeb orbits L, can one deduce the existence of other\nclosed Reeb orbits from knowledge about L?\nLet us call an affirmative answer to such a question an implied existence result.\nWe will see that in some instances one can obtain an affirmative answer to\nthis question. These results agree with affirmative answers to analogous questions\nfor certain similar conservative systems in low dimensions studied in e.g. [Ang05,\nGVV03, GVVW], but the present methods differ significantly. Specifically, to exhibit implied existence we study cylindrical contact homology on the complement\nof L for non-degenerate contact forms \u03bb imposing as few conditions on the orbit set\nas we can manage. We will show in detail one approach to such a theory inspired by\nthe intersection theory of [Sie08] for the necessary compactness arguments1.1. We\nuse established techniques [CH08a, Bou02] to compute this homology in some cases,\nand use these computations as a tool to affirmatively answer the above question in\ncertain cases.\n1.1. A version of cylindrical contact homology on Reeb orbit complements. In this paper we denote by V a 3-dimensional manifold. A one-form \u03bb on\nV is called a contact form if \u03bb\u2227d\u03bb is everywhere non-zero. Such a one-form uniquely\ndetermines its Reeb vector field X\u03bb by the equations \u03bb(X\u03bb ) \u2261 1, d\u03bb(X\u03bb , *) \u2261 0. It\nalso determines a distribution \u03be = ker \u03bb, which is a contact structure, and two\nforms \u03bb\u00b1 induce the same contact structure if and only if \u03bb+ = f * \u03bb\u2212 for some\nnowhere vanishing function. The Conley-Zehnder index of a closed orbit for this\nvector field is a measure of the rotation of the flow around the closed orbit - see\n1.1It has been pointed out to the author that other approaches are possible e.g. using convexity\nfor compactness arguments, see e.g. [CGHH10].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nProposition 2.4 for one characterization of the Conley-Zehnder index. The ConleyZehnder index usually depends on a choice of trivializations, but in many cases we\nwill consider, e.g. the tight 3-sphere, there is a global trivialization which is used\nto define Conley-Zehnder indices independently of choices.\n1.1.1. The hypotheses (E) and (P LC). We introduce two types of technical hypotheses below, which are not mutually exclusive. They simplify the construction\nof contact homology on V \\L which we use to deduce implied existence. We will\ngive some examples of forms on the 3-sphere later which we hope will help to clarify\nthese hypotheses.\nWe will consider pairs (\u03bb, L) in which \u03bb is a non-degenerate contact form on V\nand L is a link composed of closed orbits of the Reeb vector field of \u03bb. Sometimes it\nmay be convenient to refer to the subset of closed Reeb orbits with image contained\nin L; we will abuse language and denote this subset of closed Reeb orbits by L\nagain1.2.\nFollowing standard terminology1.3, an orbit is elliptic if the eigenvalues of its\nlinearized Poincar\u00e9 return map (a linear symplectic map on \u03be) are non-real.\nDefinition 1.1. We will say (\u03bb, L) satisfies the \"ellipticity\" condition (abbreviated\nby (E)) if\n\u2022 each orbit in L is non-degenerate elliptic (including multiple covers)\n\u2022 each contractible Reeb orbit y not in L \"links\" with L in the sense that for\nany disc with boundary y, L intersects the interior of the disc.\nWe shall see these hypotheses force the compactness of moduli of holomorphic\ncylinders in V \\L necessary to define cylindrical contact homology. Before we continue, let us note a very simple example:\nExample 1.2. Consider R4 = R2 \u00d7 R2 with the usual polar coordinates (ri , \u03b8i )\n(i = 1, 2) on each R2 factor of R4 and let E be the ellipsoid determined by the\nequation\nr2\nr12\n+ 2 =1\na\nb\nwhere a, b are positive constants. The one form\n\u03bb0 =\n\n2\nX\n1\ni=1\n\n2\n\nri2 d\u03b8i\n\nrestricted to E defines a contact form which we denote \u03bb. If the ratio a/b is\nirrational, then there are precisely two geometrically distinct closed Reeb orbits,\nP 0 = S \u2229 C \u00d7 {0}, Q0 = S \u2229 {0} \u00d7 C. They are both non-degenerate and elliptic\nwith Conley-Zehnder indices\n\u0016 \u0012\n\u0013\u0017\nj \u0010\na \u0011k\nb\n0k\n0k\nCZ(P ) = 2 k 1 +\n+ 1,\nCZ(Q ) = 2 k 1 +\n+1\nb\na\n\nSince the linking numbers `(P 0k , Q0 ) = k, `(P 0 , Q0k ) = k, the pairs (\u03bb, P 0 ), (\u03bb, Q0 ),\n(\u03bb, P 0 t Q0 ) all satisfy (E).\n\n1.2i.e. L refers to both a closed embedded submanifold which is tangent to the Reeb vector\nfield X, as well as the set of solutions x : R/(T * Z) \u2192 V, \u1e8b = X(x) modulo reparametrization with\nimage contained in L (this includes multiple covers of components of L).\n1.3\ne.g. [KH95]; see also Proposition 2.4 for another characterization of elliptic.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n3\n\nFirst component of L\nThe loop \"a\"\n\nL\n\na\n\nSecond component of L\n\n(1) The homotopy class of a is a proper link class for (2) Here a does not represent\nthe two component link L above.\na proper link class for L.\n\nFigure 1.1. Example and counter-example of proper link classes\nin Definition 1.3.\nSee Example 6.1 in section 6 for a more interesting class of examples.\nThere is another way to control compactness of holomorphic cylinders. Again\nassume L is a link of closed orbits for \u03bb, and let [a] be the homotopy class of a loop\na in the complement.\nDefinition 1.3. We say that (\u03bb, L, [a]) satisfies the \"proper link class\" condition\n(P LC) if\n\u2022 for any connected component x \u2282 L, no representative \u03b3 \u2208 [a] can be\nhomotoped to x inside V \\L i.e. there is no homotopy I : [0, 1] \u00d7 S 1 \u2192 V\n(with I(0, *) = \u03b3 and I(1, *) = x) such that I([0, 1) \u00d7 S 1 ) \u2282 V \\L. We will\ncall such a [a] a proper link class for L.\n\u2022 for every disc F with boundary \u2202F = y a closed (non-constant, but possibly\nmultiply covered) Reeb orbit (possibly in L), there is a component x of L\nthat intersects the interior of F .\nSee Figure 1(1) for an example, and Figure 1(2) for a counter-example.\nThe class [a] is meant to be analogous to a proper braid class studied in [GVV03,\nGVVW]. Both conditions (E) and (P LC) contain a \"no contractible orbits\" hypothesis. Such a hypothesis is necessary to preclude \"bubbling\", which is an obstruction to defining cylindrical contact homology in general [EGH00]1.4. We point\nto Examples 6.1, 6.2 below for concrete examples of orbits and (Morse-Bott) contact\nforms on the tight S 3 satisfying conditions (E) and (P LC) respectively.\n1.1.2. An invariant, contact homology. We define a relation on pairs (\u03bb, L) as\nabove. Suppose we have two such pairs (\u03bb\u00b1 , L\u00b1 ). We write (\u03bb+ , L+ ) \u223c (\u03bb\u2212 , L\u2212 )\nif ker(\u03bb+ ) = ker(\u03bb\u2212 ) and L+ = L\u2212 . We say (\u03bb+ , L) \u2265 (\u03bb\u2212 , L) if they are related\nby \u223c and the Conley-Zehnder indices of the orbits in L (including multiple covers)\nare always greater or equal when considered as orbits for \u03bb+ than when considered as orbits for \u03bb\u2212 . If (\u03bb0 , L) \u2265 (\u03bb1 , L) and (\u03bb1 , L) \u2265 (\u03bb0 , L) then we write\n(\u03bb0 , L) \u2261 (\u03bb1 , L).\nIn Section 4 we associate with a pair (\u03bb, L) satisfying (E) and the homotopy\nclass [a] of a loop a, or with a triple (\u03bb, L, [a]) satisfying (P LC), an invariant\n1.4The necessary hypotheses can actually be weakened with greater care. We remark that the\n\"no contractible orbits\" hypothesis in (P LC) is more restrictive.\n\n\f4\n\nAL MOMIN\n[a]\n\nCCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel L). It is invariant in the sense that it depends only on the equivalence class \u2261 in case (\u03bb, L) satisfy (E) (that is, it depends on the Conley-Zehnder\nindices of the elliptic orbits in L), and in the case (P LC) it depends only on equiv[a]\nalence classes of \u223c (i.e. only on the contact structure \u03be). CCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel L) will be\nan isomorphism class of graded vector spaces, so it makes sense to say whether or\nnot it is zero.\nIt follows easily from the constructions of the invariants in Section 4 that:\nTheorem 1.4. Given a homotopy class [a], if the pair (\u03bb, L) satisfies (E) or the\n[a]\ntriple (\u03bb, L, [a]) satisfies (P LC), and CCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel L) 6= 0, then there is a closed\nReeb orbit in the homotopy class [a].\n1.2. A general implied existence result. The non-degeneracy assumption on\nthe form \u03bb in Theorem 1.4, and the implicit assumptions about contractible orbits are unfortunate, but can be weakened considerably by stretching-the-neck and\ncompactness arguments given in Section 5.\nTheorem 1.5. Suppose \u03bb is a contact form with a closed orbit set L. Suppose\neither\n\u2022 L is non-degenerate and elliptic, or\n\u2022 (1) L is such that every disc F with boundary \u2202F \u2282 L and [\u2202F ] 6= 0 \u2208\nH1 (L) has an interior intersection with L, and\n(2) [a] is a proper link class relative to L.\n[a]\n\nIf [a] is simple and CCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel L) 6= 0, then there is a closed Reeb orbit in the\nhomotopy class [a].\nTo clarify a possible point of confusion in the statement of Theorem 1.5, when\n[a]\nwe say CCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel L) 6= 0 we mean that there is a \u03bb0 \u2261 \u03bb resp. \u03bb0 \u223c \u03bb satisfying\n[a]\n(E) resp. (P LC) for which CCH\u2217 can be computed and is non-zero.\nWhen [a] is a proper link class, this theorem requires no non-degeneracy hypotheses whatsoever on \u03bb, and in the ellipticity case requires only non-degeneracy\nof the orbits in L. For a concrete example where this is applicable see Example 6.2,\nand Section 6.4.\n1.3. Some applications in S 3 . The results here are corollaries of Theorem 1.5 in\nSection 1.2 and the examples and computations of Section 6.\nOne application is the existence of analogs of \"(p, q)-type orbits\" if a certain pair\nof closed Reeb orbits exists and satisfy a \"non-resonance\" condition (namely the\npair violates the \"resonance\" condition introduced in [BCE07] when the differential\nof cylindrical contact homology in the tight S 3 vanishes). In the following statement\n`(*, *) denotes the linking number of two knots in S 3 .\nCorollary 1.6. Let \u03bb be a tight contact form on the 3-sphere. Suppose that there\nis a pair of periodic orbits L1 , L2 such that L1 t L2 is the Hopf link with self-linking\n01.5. Suppose L1 and L2 (and all multiple covers) are non-degenerate elliptic, and\n1.5By Theorem 4.1 in [EHM], all such links are transversely isotopic. The pair H t H of\n1\n2\nExample 6.1 is one such example.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n5\n\nlet \u03b81 , \u03b82 be the unique irrational numbers satisfying\nCZ(Lk1 ) = 2 bk (1 + \u03b81 )c + 1, for all k \u2265 1\n\nCZ(Lk2 ) = 2 bk (1 + 1/\u03b82 )c + 1, for all k \u2265 1\n\nThen\n(1) If \u03b81 , \u03b82 > 0 and \u03b81 6= \u03b82 , then for each relatively prime pair (p, q) such that\nq\n\u2208 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) t (\u03b82 , \u03b81 )\np\nthere is a simple closed Reeb orbit P(p,q) such that `(P(p,q) , L1 ) = q and\n`(P(p,q) , L2 ) = p.\n(2) If \u03b81 < 0 < \u03b82 (if \u03b82 < 0 < \u03b81 ), relabel the orbits so that this is the case),\nthen for each relatively prime pair (p, q) such that\nq\np > 0, and \u2208 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 )\np\nthere is a simple closed Reeb orbit P(p,q) such that `(P(p,q) , L1 ) = q and\n`(P(p,q) , L2 ) = p.\n(3) If \u03b81 , \u03b82 < 0, then for each relatively prime pair (p, q) such that\np > 0 and\n\nq\np\n1\n\u2208 (\u03b81 , 1]; or q > 0 and \u2208 ( , 1]\np\nq\n\u03b82\n\nthere is a simple closed Reeb orbit P(p,q) such that `(P(p,q) , L1 ) = q and\n`(P(p,q) , L2 ) = p.\nRemark 1.7. There are no hidden hypotheses on the contact form being either\ndynamically convex or non-degenerate (except in the explicit hypotheses on the\norbits L1 , L2 ). There are other approaches to prove such a result using the surface of\nsection constructed by [HWZ98], [HS10] and applying the result of [Fra92]; however,\nthe construction of these surfaces of section require additional hypotheses, so it is\nnot clear that they always exist. The result above applies even when there may be\nno such surface of section.\nProof. By Theorem 4.1 in [EHM], there is a transverse isotopy from L1 t L2 to the\nlink H1 t H2 in Example 6.1, which extends to an ambient contact isotopy, and\ntherefore a contactomorphism taking L1 t L2 to H1 t H2 . By applying the given\ncontactomorphism we can assume (\u03bb, L1 t L2 ) \u2261 (\u03bb0 , H1 t H2 ) with (\u03bb0 , H1 t H2 )\nfrom Example 6.1. It follows immediately from Theorem 1.5 (each component is\nelliptic by hypothesis) and the computation in Example 6.1.\n\u0003\nIt is interesting to interpret this result in the case the contact form is obtained\nfrom a metric on S 2 . Angenent [Ang05] proved that if one has a simple, closed\ngeodesic for a C 2,\u03bc -Riemannian metric on S 2 , then whenever Poincar\u00e9's inverse\nrotation number \u03c1 6= 1, for every p/q \u2208 (\u03c1, 1) \u222a (1, \u03c1) there is a geodesic \u03b3p,q\nwith the flat-knot type of a (p, q)-satellite geodesic. The following Corollary is a\nversion of this result with stronger hypotheses on the rotation number and weaker\nconclusions about the resulting geodesics, but allowing the metric to be reversible\nFinsler. It is a direct consequence of Corollary 1.6 applied to the geodesic flow of\na reversible Finsler metric on S 2 which will be proved in Section 6.2\n\n\f6\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nCorollary 1.8. Let F be a reversible Finsler metric on S 2 . Suppose \u03b3 is a simple,\nclosed geodesic with irrational inverse rotation number \u03c1 6= 1. Then for every pair\nof relatively prime integers p, q such that\np+q\np+q\nor\n\u2208 (\u03c1, 1] \u222a [1, \u03c1)\n2q\n2p\nthere is a geodesic \u03b3p,q with the following topological property. If \u03b3, \u03b3 denote the\nlifted double covers of the geodesic to S 3 (traversed \"forwards\" and \"backwards\"),\nthen \u03b3p,q has linking number p with \u03b3 and q with \u03b3. In particular, the geodesics are\ngeometrically distinguished (up to a double-count by traversing \u03b3p,q oppositely).\nCorollaries 1.6 and 1.8 will be improved to cover the degenerate and hyperbolic\ncases as well in collaboration with Umberto Hryniewicz and Pedro Salom\u00e3o [HMSa].\nWe give other examples by considering fibered knots or links in the 3-sphere, in\nwhich conclusions can be drawn without non-degeneracy hypotheses1.6. One class\nof examples is obtained as follows. Let us say that a knot B in the tight 3-sphere\nis a tight fibered hyperbolic knot if the following conditions hold:\n(1) (fibered) The knot B is the binding of an open book decomposition of S 3\n(2) (tight) The contact structure supported by the open book is the tight contact structure on S 3\n(3) (hyperbolic) The monodromy map h of the associated open book decomposition is pseudo-Anosov\n(4) The map h\u2217 \u2212 I : H 1 (S; R) \u2192 H 1 (S; R) (where S is a page of the open\nbook) is invertible\nWe remark that the fourth condition actually follows automatically from the\nfirst; it will be a convenient fact (see section 6.5 where we also explain why this\nfollows). We make some further brief remarks about this class of knots in section\n6.5. For now we merely note that there are infinitely many examples, such as the\nFintushel-Stern knot which is the Pretzel knot (\u22122, 3, 7). For tight fibered hyperbolic\nknots in S 3 (see Section 6.5):\nCorollary 1.9. Suppose \u03bb is a tight contact form on S 3 . If its Reeb vector field\nhas a closed orbit which is a tight fibered hyperbolic knot realizing the ThurstonBennequin bound as a transverse knot, then there are infinitely many geometrically\ndistinct closed Reeb orbits and the number of such orbits of period at most T is\nbounded below by an exponential function of T .\nThe required calculation is essentially due to Colin-Honda [CH08a], but turns\nout simpler because one does not need to consider holomorphic curves that intersect\nthe binding.\nRemark 1.10. Again, there are no hidden non-degeneracy hypotheses, and it applies to all tight contact forms (not only dynamically convex ones). Theorem 1.5\nallows one to draw conclusions about free homotopy classes which must contain\nclosed Reeb orbits.\nFinally, cylindrical contact homology is usually thought to be only applicable\nto tight contact structures. However, after removing a certain orbit set, it may\n1.6In Corollary 6.3 we will also give another example, related to the example used in the\nprevious Corollary, which does not assume non-degeneracy of the orbit set L. We postpone the\nstatement to section 6 where it will be easier to describe the link L.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n7\n\nbe possible to apply cylindrical contact homology on the complement of the orbit\nset. For example, we can take the figure eight knot in the 3-sphere, which satisfies\nproperties 1, 3, 4 in the definition of fibered hyperbolic supporting knots, but not\nproperty 2 (that is, it is fibered and hyperbolic, but does not support the tight\ncontact structure). Hence it supports an over-twisted contact structure; Theorem\n1.5 still applies from which one can deduce the following:\nCorollary 1.11. Let \u03bb be a contact form for the (over-twisted) contact structure\non S 3 supported by the open book decomposition with binding the figure eight knot,\npage diffeomorphic to a once-punctured torus, and monodromy map given by the\nmatrix transformation\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 1\n1 1\n\nSuppose \u03bb has a closed Reeb orbit transversely isotopic to the binding. Then the\nnumber of geometrically distinct periodic orbits of action at most N grows at least\nexponentially in N .\n\nWe note that in the above one can describe homotopy classes that must contain\na closed orbit.\nWe will go over the details of this particular example in Section 6. An analogous\nresult will hold for any (non-tight) fibered hyperbolic knot in S 3 , examples of which\nare plentiful [CL].\n1.4. Further comments, outline, and acknowledgements.\n1.4.1. Comments. It is possible to study the cylindrical contact homology of stable\nHamiltonian structures on complements of elliptic Reeb orbits (or in proper link\nclasses) in general. For example, the mapping tori of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms\nof surfaces fits in this category. In this case there are clearly no contractible Reeb\norbits, and bubbling of spheres is not difficult to rule out in most cases. The portion\nof the loops space corresponding to the first return map are all simple homotopy\nclasses and thus CCH\u2217 is well-defined and coincides with Floer homology. This\nparticular case has been carried out explicitly (at least in the case the surface is a\ndisc) and is called \"braid Floer homology\" in [GVVW].\n1.4.2. Outline. In section 2 we recall the geometric and analytic set-up. Section 3\ndescribes an intersection theory of pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectizations\n[Sie09] and derives some compactness results from this intersection theory. In section 4 we describe the chain complexes, maps and homotopies. In section 5, we\ndescribe how to draw conclusions when the contact form might be degenerate or\nthere may be contractible (in V \\L) closed Reeb orbits. In section 6 some explicit\nexamples on the 3-sphere are worked out in detail.\n1.4.3. Acknowledgments.

Review of geometric and analytic set-up\n2.1. Symplectizations. Let (V, \u03be) be a co-oriented contact manifold. Then there\nis a symplectic manifold associated with it, W\u03be =\u03be\n \u0307 \u22a5 \\0 (the annihilator of \u03be in T \u2217 V\nminus the zero section) which is a sub-bundle and symplectic submanifold of T \u2217 V\nwith respect to the exterior derivative of the Liouville form, d\u03b8can . The symplectic\nmanifold (W\u03be , \u03c9\u03be = d\u03b8can |W\u03be ) is called the symplectization of (V, \u03be). Because \u03be is\nco-oriented there are two components, W\u03be,\u00b1 . We will consider only the component\nW\u03be,+ and when we write W\u03be we mean this component only. There is a natural R\naction (a, \u03bb) 7\u2192 a \u2217 \u03bb = ea * \u03bb given by scalar multiplication in the fibers, and a\nnatural projection to V by restricting the projection T \u2217 V \u2192 V to W\u03be .\nAny positively co-oriented contact form \u03bb for \u03be defines a global section of W\u03be\nwhich gives an identification\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bb0\n0\n0\n\u223c\n\u03c8\u03bb : W\u03be = R \u00d7 V,\n\u03bb 7\u2192 a = ln , x = \u03c0(\u03bb )\n\u03bb\n(where \u03c0 denotes the restriction to W\u03be of the projection T \u2217 V \u2192 V ) in which the\nsymplectic form for W\u03be is d(ea * \u03bb).\nGiven such a \u03bb we denote by X the Reeb vector field, defined by\nX\u00ac\u03bb \u2261 1,\n\nX\u00acd\u03bb \u2261 0\n\nWe will later assume that \u03bb is non-degenerate, a generic condition meaning that\nno closed periodic orbit has a Floquet multiplier equal to 1; for the moment this is\nnot necessary. Given a contact form \u03bb, we define a splitting of T W\u03be :\nT\u03bb0 (x) W\u03be = R * \u2202a \u2295 R * d(\u03c8\u03bb\u22121 )\u03c8(\u03bb0 ) (0, X) \u2295 d(\u03c8\u03bb\u22121 )\u03c8(\u03bb0 ) (0 \u00d7 \u03be)\nb \u2295 \u03beb\n=: R * \u2202a \u2295 R * X\n\nb and \u03be for \u03beb2.1.\nWe might abuse notation and use X to denote X\n\n2.1.1. Almost-complex structures. Given a contact form \u03bb for \u03be, consider the symplectic vector bundle (\u03be, d\u03bb) over V and let J (\u03be) be the set of d\u03bb-compatible almostcomplex structures. This defines a set of almost-complex structures on \u03beb via\nb 0 ) = (d\u03c8 \u22121 )\u03c8(\u03bb ) |\u03be \u25e6 J \u25e6 (d\u03c8\u03bb )\u03bb | b\nJ(\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u03be\n\nFinally this extends to all of T\u03bb0 W\u03be by\nb\n\u2202a 7\u2192 X\n\nb 7\u2192 \u2212\u2202a\nX\n\nWe denote the set of almost-complex structures on T W\u03be that arise in this way\nJ (\u03bb); we can identify this with J (\u03be). The almost-complex structures in J (\u03bb) are\ncalled cylindrical almost-complex structures.\n2.1.2. Cylindrical ends. To compare contact homology between different choices of\n\u03bb, one studies the symplectization and almost-complex structure with cylindrical\nends. We define an order relation on the fibers of \u03c0 : W\u03be \u2192 V as follows: given\n\u03bb0 , \u03bb1 \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (x), we say \u03bb0 \u227a \u03bb1 (resp. \u03bb0 \u0016 \u03bb1 ) if \u03bb1 /\u03bb0 > 1 (resp. \u03bb1 /\u03bb0 \u2265 1).\nGiven two contact forms \u03bb0 , \u03bb1 for \u03be, we write \u03bb0 \u227a \u03bb1 if \u03bb0 (x) \u227a \u03bb1 (x) on each\nfiber, or equivalently when we write \u03bb1 = r\u03bb0 we have r > 1 pointwise. If \u03bb\u2212 \u227a \u03bb+ ,\nthen we set\nW (\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ ) = {\u03bb \u2208 W\u03be |\u03bb\u2212 (\u03c0(\u03bb)) \u0016 \u03bb \u0016 \u03bb+ (\u03c0(\u03bb))}\n2.1The subspaces R * X\nb and \u03beb both depend on the choice of \u03bb.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n9\n\nThis is an exact symplectic cobordism between (V, \u03bb\u2212 ), (V, \u03bb+ ).

For J \u2208 J (Jb+ , Jb\u2212 ) the\nalmost-complex manifold (W, J) is said to have cylindrical ends W \u00b1 .\nIt is also necessary to consider families of almost-complex structures; we will\ndenote by J\u03c4 (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ ) the space of smooth paths [0, 1] \u2192 J (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ ), \u03c4 7\u2192 J\u03c4 .\n\n2.1.3.

A J-holomorphic map on a punctured\nRiemann surface (\u03a3, j, \u0393) is a map U : \u03a3\\\u0393 \u2192 W\u03be that satisfies the CauchyRiemann equation\nDU + J * DU * j = 0\nWe only consider solutions of this equation having finite energy; for the definition\nof finite energy J-holomorphic curves we refer to [BEH+ 03].\nA crucial example for cylindrical almost-complex structure J are the trivial cylinders over a periodic Reeb orbit x of some period T : it is a solution of the form\n(for (s, t) \u2208 R \u00d7 S 1 ) \u03c8\u03bb \u25e6 U (s, t) = (T s + a0 , x(T * t)). If a contact form is (MorseBott) non-degenerate2.3, then at any (non-removeable) puncture a finite energy\nJ-holomorphic map is asymptotic to a half-trivial cylinder over a closed Reeb orbit\nin one of the ends W \u00b1 , see [HWZ95] or [BEH+ 03]. A puncture is called positive\n(resp. negative) if it is asymptotic to the positive (resp. negative) half of a trivial\ncylinder in W + (resp. W \u2212 ). We will say that a finite energy holomorphic map\nis positively (resp. negatively) asymptotic to a Reeb orbit x if there is a positive\n(resp. negative) puncture z (perhaps already specified) at which U is asymptotic\nto a half-trivial cylinder over x in W + (resp. W \u2212 ).\nWhen the contact form is (Morse-Bott) non-degenerate, then the asymptotic\nconvergence to the trivial half-cylinder mentioned above is exponential in nature\nand one has an asymptotic formula [HWZ96, Sie08]. If one looks at the space\nof maps asymptotic to fixed closed Reeb orbits with a given rate of exponential\nconvergence, then there is a Fredholm theory for the Cauchy-Riemann operator\n[Dra04, Wen10].\nOne more crucial property of finite-energy holomorphic curves is the compactness theory of [BEH+ 03]. In section 8 of [BEH+ 03], a notion of a k\u2212 |1|k+ level\nholomorphic building and convergence of a sequence of holomorphic maps to that\nbuilding is given. We refer to that paper for the definitions. Theorem 10.3 of\n[BEH+ 03] extends to the case where W has cylindrical ends as well, so that the\nspace of JR -holomorphic maps can be compactified for sequences with R \u2191 \u221e. The\ncompactification consists of a holomorphic building in (W \u2212 (\u03bb0 ), J10 ) t (W \u2212 (\u03bb0 ), J20 )\nc0 (\u03bb0 ) holomorphic building, all of which glue together to W \u2212 (\u03bb0 )\ntogether with a J\n+\nW (\u03bb0 ) = W\u03be .

Suppose \u03bb\u00b1 are two contact\nforms for \u03be satisfying \u03bb\u2212 \u227a \u03bb+ and that L \u2282 V is a link that is tangent to the Reeb\nvector fields for both. With the projection \u03c0 : W\u03be \u2192 V consider ZL = \u03c0 \u22121 (L);\nwhich is a union of embedded cylinders. We have\nLemma 2.2. ZL is an embedded symplectic submanifold of (W\u03be , \u03c9\u03be ).\nb\nProof. ZL is embedded, and each component of ZL is J(\u03bb)-holomorphic\nfor any \u03bb\nwith kernel \u03be and Reeb vector field tangent to L, and any J \u2208 J (\u03be). By hypothesis\nb\non L there exist such \u03bb. Since each J(\u03bb)\nis \u03c9\u03be -compatible, we see ZL must be\nsymplectic.\n\u0003\nLemma 2.3. The subset J (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ : ZL ) of J (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ ) such that T ZL is J invariant\nis non-empty and contractible.\n\nThe proof of this fact is standard after the observations that (1) ZL is an embedded symplectic manifold, and (2) that regardless of Jb\u00b1 (\u03bb\u00b1 ), ZL is J holomorphic in W \u00b1 . One considers the space of metrics for which, along ZL , T ZL and\n(T ZL )\u03c9 (the symplectic complement) are orthogonal and then mimics the usual\nproof that the space of almost-complex structures is non-empty and contractible\n(e.g. [HZ94]). We therefore omit the details. Denote the space of smooth paths\n\n\f12\n\nAL MOMIN\n\n[0, 1] \u2192 J (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ : ZL ) by J\u03c4 (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ : ZL ). Notice that if J1 \u2208 J (Jb\u2212 , Jb0 : ZL ) and\nJ2 \u2208 J (Jb0 , Jb+ : ZL ) then for each JR \u2208 J (J1 , J2 ) the set \u03c0 \u22121 (L) is JR -holomorphic\nas well.\n2.2. Review of some facts about Conley-Zehnder Indices. Let x be a closed\nReeb orbit, x be the simple Reeb orbit with the same image as x, and \u03a6 be a\ntrivialization \u03a6 : S 1 \u00d7 C \u2192 x\u2217 \u03be. We denote by CZ\u03a6 (x) the Conley-Zehnder index\nof x with respect to the trivialization obtained from \u03a6 by the obvious degree mx\ncovering of S 1 \u00d7 C (where mx is the covering number of x over x), unless it is\nspecified that \u03a6 is a trivialization of x\u2217 \u03be itself (in which case we will compute with\nrespect to \u03a6). If the trivialization is clear in a given context we drop the subscript\n\u03a6 from CZ\u03a6 .\nOne very useful fact about the Conley-Zehnder index is that it grows almostlinearly for Reeb orbits in dimension 3 (see e.g. [HWZ03] Theorem 8.3, or [Hut02])\nin the following precise sense.\nProposition 2.4. Let \u03b3 be a periodic orbit of minimal period T , and \u03a8 a trivialization of the contact structure over that orbit. The Conley-Zehnder index CZ\u03a8 (\u03b3 k )\nis monotone in k. Moreover, one has the following characterization of the index of\nits coverings \u03b3 k :\n\u2022 If \u03b3 is elliptic, there exists a unique \u03b8 so that the complex eigenvalues of\n\u03a6T are e\u00b12\u03c0i\u03b8 , and for all covering numbers k, CZ\u03a8 (\u03b3 k ) = 2bk * \u03b8c + 1.\n\u2022 If \u03b3 is hyperbolic then there exists an integer n so that CZ\u03a8 (\u03b3 k ) is k * n.\nAnother very useful fact is a relationship between the Conley-Zehnder index and\nthe winding of eigensections of the asymptotic operator associated to the orbit x.\nDefinition 2.5. Let P be a simple, closed Reeb orbit, and k \u2265 1 be an integer.\n\u2212\nWe define \u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) to be the winding number of the eigensection associated to the\nlargest negative eigenvalue of the asymptotic operator of (P, k) (the k-fold covering\n+\nof P ) with respect to \u03a6, and \u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) to be the winding associated to the least\npositive eigenvalue (see [Sie09]).\nIt is proved in [HWZ95] that the the eigenvalues can be ordered (with multiplicity) so that the winding of the corresponding eigensections is non-decreasing and\nincreases by 1 every second eigenvalue, and that the Conley-Zehnder index is given\nby\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nCZ\u03a6 (P, k) = \u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) + \u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) = 2\u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) + p(P, k)\nwhere p(P, k) is the parity of the Conley-Zehnder index and is equal to either 0 or\n1 depending on whether the winding numbers of the 'extremal' positive/negative\neigenvalues agree or disagree:\nIn particular, the Conley-Zehnder index is odd if and only if the winding of the\neigensections associated with the eigenvalues nearest zero differ. This is important\nbecause it implies by the asymptotic formulas of e.g. [HWZ96, Sie08] that at\nodd index orbits that the holomorphic curves necessarily wind around the orbit\ndifferently (depending on whether they approach positively or negatively).\n\u2212\nUsing Proposition 2.4 we see easily that \u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) is given by bk\u03b8c if P is elliptic,\n+\nk*n\nand b 2 c if it is hyperbolic (even or odd), and \u03b1\u03a6\n(P, k) is given by dk\u03b8e if P is\nk*n\nelliptic, and d 2 e if it is hyperbolic.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n13\n\n2.3. Transversality for cylinders. In this section we assume that \u03bb is a nondegenerate contact form on V . We will consider J-holomorphic cylinders in the\nsymplectization and transversality of the Cauchy-Riemann operator for these cylinders. Here J = Jb will be a cylindrical almost-complex structure. The constructions of the chain complexes in Section 4 requires the Cauchy-Riemann operator\nto be transverse on enough moduli spaces. In particular we will prove the following transversality Theorem. In order to state it, we recall first that a Reeb orbit is\ncalled SFT-good if it is not an even cover of another orbit with odd Conley-Zehnder\nindex.\nTheorem 2.6. By [Dra04] there is a residual subset Jgen (\u03bb) of J (\u03bb) such that\nfor all somewhere injective J-holomorphic curves the Cauchy-Riemann operator is\ntransverse for J \u2208 Jgen (\u03bb). Let J \u2208 Jgen (\u03bb):\n(1) At a J-holomorphic cylinder U of index Ind(U ) \u2264 1, the Cauchy-Riemann\noperator is transverse at U . In particular the only index \u2264 0 cylinders are\ntrivial cylinders.\n(2) At a J-holomorphic cylinder U of index Ind(U ) = 2, and such that both\nasymptotic orbits are SFT-good, the Cauchy-Riemann operator is transverse\nat U .\n\nTherefore the corresponding moduli spaces (modulo the free smooth R-action) consist of isolated points (index 0 or 1 case) or of isolated intervals or circles (index 2\ncase).\n2.3.1. Some Inequalities. Let \u03c0 denote the projection of T V to the contact structure ker(\u03bb). Given a finite energy surface U = (a, u)2.4, the section \u03c0 \u25e6 T u of\n\u03a90,1 (T \u03a3, u\u2217 \u03be) is quite useful. It is proved in [HWZ95] that either it vanishes identically or it has isolated zeros. We let wind\u03c0 (U) denote the oriented count of zeros\nof this section, which is proved in [HWZ95] to be non-negative. Also, we will use\nthe following topological quantities:\n\u2022 Denote by \u0393 the set of punctures of the map U and by \u0393\u00b1 the subsets of positive and negative punctures. Also, #\u0393even denotes the number of punctures\nasymptotic to orbits of even Conley-Zehnder index, and #\u0393odd denotes the\nnumber of punctures asymptotic to orbits of odd Conley-Zehnder index.\n\u2022\nX\nX\n(2.1)\nCZ(U ) =\nCZ(z + ) \u2212\nCZ(z \u2212 )\nz + \u2208\u0393+\n\nz \u2212 \u2208\u0393\u2212\n\n(this requires a choice of trivialization of U \u2217 \u03be, but is independent of that\nchoice).\n\u2022 Ind(U ) = CZ(U ) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03a3) + #\u0393, and 2cN (U ) = Ind(U ) \u2212 \u03c7(\u03a3) + #\u0393even\n\nWe will use the following theorem, proved in [HWZ95], to show that certain curves\nare immersed in order to apply the automatic transversality Theorem 2.8.\nTheorem 2.7.

Review of some results about transversality. The Fredholm theory here was\ndeveloped in [Dra04]. There the author defines a Banach manifold\nBg1,p;d (x1 , . . . , xk ; y1 , . . . , yl ),\n1,p\nwhere p > 2, of Wloc\nmaps from a surface of genus g with k 'positive' punctures\nand l 'negative' punctures into R \u00d7 V which converge exponentially with weight d\nin W 1,p to the periodic orbits x1 , . . . , xk at positive punctures and to y1 , . . . , yl at\nnegative punctures. We will really only need the cases g = 0, k = 1, l = 1. Given\nthis structure we have a section\n\n\u2202 J (U ) = dU + J \u25e6 dU \u25e6 j\n\ndefined over B into a smooth bundle E over B with fibers\nE=\n\n[\n\nU \u2208B\n\n{U } \u00d7 Lp,\u03b4 (\u03a90,1 (T \u03a3\u0307 \u2297C U \u2217 T W ))\n\nAt a zero of this section, U , we define FU to be the projection of D\u2202 J (U ) to the\nvertical part TU E \u223c\n= TU B \u2295 EU . It is then proved in [Dra04] that FU is a Fredholm\noperator. We say the Cauchy-Riemann operator is transverse or regular at U (or\nU is a transverse solution, etc.) if FU is a surjective operator, and that a subset of\nsolutions is transverse if each element is a transverse solution. Its index (computed\nin [Dra04]) gives the dimension of parameterized (j, J)-holomorphic maps near U\nwhen U is transverse. The dimension of the moduli space (allowing j to vary and\ndividing by automorphisms\nof the domain)\nis then given by the topological quantity\n\u0010\n\u0011\ndim(R\u00d7V )\n\u2212 3 (\u03c7\u03a3 \u2212 #\u0393)\n2\ndim(R\u00d7V)\nearlier since\n= 2.\n2\n\nInd(U ) = CZ(U ) +\n\nwhich coincides with the definition\n\nof Ind(U) given\nWe cite a special case of Theorem 0.1 in [Wen10] (valid for dim(R \u00d7 V) = 4):\n\nTheorem 2.8. [Wen10] Suppose that U is an immersed finite energy surface. Letting g denote the genus of the domain of U , the linearized operator is surjective\nif\nInd(U) \u2265 2g + #\u0393even \u2212 1.\nWe also need results for somewhere-injective curves. Following the notation\nof [Dra04], define the set M = M(x1 , . . . , xn ; y1 . . . , yn ) the set (C, J) of pairs\nconsisting of non-parametrized curves C and compatible almost-complex structures\nJ \u2208 J (where J = J (\u03bb) or J (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ )) for which C is J-holomorphic (for some\nparametrization) positively asymptotic to the Reeb orbits xi and negatively to the\nyj . In case J = J (\u03bb) one quotients by the free R-action on solutions as well. We\nhave the following from [Dra04] (Theorem 1.8 and its Corollary) which holds in any\ndimension:\nTheorem 2.9. The set M carries a structure of a separable Banach manifold. The\nprojection map \u03b7 : M \u2192 J , \u03b7(C, J) = J, is a Fredholm map with Fredholm index\nInd(C) = Ind(U ), where U : (S, j)\\\u0393 \u2192 R \u00d7 V parametrizes C.\nFor regular values J of \u03b7, MJ = \u03b7 \u22121 (J) is a smooth, finite dimensional manifold\nwhose dimension agrees with the above index Ind(C). By the Sard-Smale theorem,\nthe set of regular values is a residual set. Consequently there is a residual set\nJgen \u2282 J of compatible almost-complex structures such that for every J \u2208 Jgen\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n15\n\nif U : S\\\u0393 \u2192 R \u00d7 V is a somewhere injective finite energy surface for J, then\nInd(U) \u2265 1 provided \u03c0 \u25e6 T u does not vanish identically.\n\nTheorem 2.9 can be proved if J = J (Jb\u2212 (\u03bb\u2212 ), Jb+ (\u03bb+ ) : Z) as well because any\nsomewhere injective curve for such a J will have a point of injectivity in W \\(W + \u222a\nW \u2212 \u222a Z) with the exceptions of (1) components of Z, and (2) holomorphic curves\nb + ) contained entirely in a cylindrical end W \u00b1 . We will not be concerned\nfor J(\u03bb\nabout transversality of such curves anyway and therefore they can be safely ignored.\nThis observation will be needed in section 4.\n2.3.3. Proof of Theorem 2.6. Theorem 2.6 is a direct consequence of\nProposition 2.10. There is a residual subset Jgen of d\u03bb-compatible almost-complex\nstructures on \u03be such that:\n(1) At any somewhere injective finite energy solution, the Cauchy-Riemann\noperator is transverse, by [Dra04].\n(2) For any compatible J (not necessarily in Jgen ), if U \u2208 MJ (x; y) is of index\n1, then the linearization of the Cauchy-Riemann operator is surjective at\nU.\n(3) Let J be any compatible almost-complex structure, and suppose U is a Jholomorphic finite-energy cylinder. Then its index is at least 0.\n(4) For J \u2208 Jgen , if U \u2208 MJ (x; y) is an index 2 cylinder, and both asymptotic\norbits are SFT-good, then the linearization of the Cauchy-Riemann operator\nis surjective at U .\n(5) For J \u2208 Jgen , all index zero holomorphic cylinders are trivial cylinders. The\nlinearized Cauchy-Riemann operator is surjective at any trivial cylinder.\nThis is in fact what we will prove.\nProof. To begin the proof, take Jgen to be as in Theorem 2.9.\n(1) The first item is an assertion in Theorem 2.9.\n(2) The map U is an immersion if wind\u03c0 (U) = 0. For finite energy cylinders of\nindex 1, Theorem 2.7 implies 0 \u2264 wind\u03c0 (U) \u2264 1 \u2212 2(2) + 1 + 2(1) = 0 (since there\nmust be one odd puncture and one even puncture). Thus, finite energy cylinders\nof index 1 are always immersed. We have g = 0 and #\u0393even = 1 (since the index\ndifference is 1, there is one even and one odd puncture), so by Theorem 2.8 the\nlinearized Cauchy-Riemann operator is surjective.\n(3) This was already observed in [HWZ95]; we include the short proof. \u03c0 \u25e6 T u\nvanishes identically on a cylinder if and only if the cylinder is a trivial cylinder.\nIf a non-trivial finite energy cylinder has index less than 0, then by Theorem 2.7\n0 \u2264 2wind\u03c0 (U) < 0 \u2212 4 + #\u0393odd + 2#\u0393even \u2264 0, which is impossible.\nTo prove (4) we will need the following lemma.\nLemma 2.11. Suppose U is a cylinder of index 2 with asymptotic limits x, y. If x\nand y have even Conley-Zehnder index and are SFT-good, then U is simply covered.\nProof. Let k be the covering number of U , so that U = U 0 \u25e6 \u03c4k where U is a simple\ncurve and \u03c4k is the degree k holomorphic cover of R \u00d7 S 1 . Choose a trivialization\n\u03a60 for U 0\u2217 \u03be, which induces trivializations \u03a6 of \u03be over U , x and y. We then have\nCZ\u03a6 (x) \u2212 CZ\u03a6 (y) = 2 by the index formula. Let CZ\u03a6 (x) = 2l + 2, so CZ\u03a6 (y) = 2l.\nLetting x0 and y 0 denote the asymptotic limits of U 0 , so that x, y are k-covers of\nx0 , y 0 , by Proposition 2.4 we have k|2l +2, and k|2l, from which it follows that k = 2\n\n\f16\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nor 1. Suppose k = 2. Then CZ\u03a60 (x0 ) = l + 1, CZ\u03a60 (y 0 ) = l. Therefore, one of these\nhas odd Conley-Zehnder index, so either x or y is a 'bad' orbit. Since both orbits\nare assumed SFT-good, k = 1.\n\u0003\n(4) The parity of the Conley-Zehnder indices are either both even or both odd. If\nthey are both even, then by Lemma 2.11 all curves in the index 2 component of the\nmoduli space are simple. Transversality of the index 2 component of the moduli\nspace for J \u2208 Jgen follows from Theorem 2.9.\nIn the case of an index-2 cylinder with odd asymptotic orbits, we observe\n0 \u2264 wind\u03c0 (U) \u2264 2 \u2212 2(2) + 2(1) + 2(0) = 0\n\nInd(U) = 2 \u2265 2g + #\u0393even \u2212 1 = 2(0) + 0 \u2212 1\nso automatic transversality applies by Theorem 2.7 and Theorem 2.8, in particular\nfor any J chosen for the case of even, SFT-good orbits.\n(5) Choose any J \u2208 Jgen . For simply covered index 0 cylinders, the inequality\nof Corollary 2.9 implies \u03c0 \u25e6 T u vanishes identically, which implies the cylinder is\ntrivial. If a cylinder is multiply covered of index 0, the underlying simple cylinder\nhas index 0 - by the monotone growth of the index of a cylinder under covering.\nHence, it is a cover of a trivial cylinder so is trivial itself. Transversality is proved\nas in [Sch95].\n\u0003\n3. Intersections and compactness\n3.1. Intersections. We recall the intersection theory described in [Sie09].\nDefinition 3.1.

A cylindrical Hamiltonian structure on W is the data\n(\u03a6, V, H) where \u03a6 : W \u2192 R \u00d7 V is a diffeomorphism and H is a stable Hamiltonian\nstructure on V .

Considering the oriented blow-up\n\u03a3 [BEH+ 03], because U is asymptotically cylindrical it extends over \u03a3 to define a\nmap U : \u03a3 \u2192 W , with the property that if B is a boundary component of \u03a3, then\nU |B is a closed Reeb orbit in \u2202W . Let us consider the subclass C 0 (W , H+ , H\u2212 )\nof those U \u2208 C 0 (\u03a3, W ) such that for each boundary component B of \u03a3, U |B is a\nclosed Reeb orbit in (\u2202 \u00b1 W \u223c\n= V \u00b1 , H\u00b1 ). By standard arguments the intersection\nnumber extends to the class C 0 (W , H+ , H\u2212 ) and is homotopy invariant within that\nclass.\nIn particular, the above discussion extends the intersection number to holomorphic buildings: a building (U ) defines a map (U ) \u2208 C 0 (W , H+ , H\u2212 ), which we use\nto set\n[(U )] \u2217 [(V )] =\n \u0307 [(U )] \u2217 [(V )]\nOnce the intersection number is extended this way, it is clear that\nLemma 3.10.

Let int(U, V) be the sum of all local intersections,\nwhich is non-negative by e.g. [McD91, MW95].\nTheorem 3.11 ([Sie09] Theorem 4.4). Suppose U, V are asymptotically cylindrical pseudoholomorphic maps in an almost-complex cobordism with cylindrical ends,\nwith no common components.

We use MJ (x; y1 , . . . , yk )\nto denote the moduli space of finite energy J-holomorphic spheres with one positive asymptotic orbit x and perhaps several negative asymptotic orbits y1 , . . . yk\n(modulo reparametrizations of the domain). Usually we are interested in moduli\nspace of cylinders with one positive and one negative end, MJ (x; y). If it is clear\nb\nwe may drop the subscript.

Suppose Z is a finite energy surface with all asymptotic orbits elliptic\n(e.g. ZL = \u03c0 \u22121 (L) under condition (E)), and [U ] \u2208 MJ (x; y1 , . . . , yn ) is such that\nno component has image contained in a component of Z. Then [U ] \u2208 MJ (x; y, * * * :\nZ) if and only if U and Z never intersect and are never asymptotic to covers of the\nsame asymptotic orbit with the same sign (in the case Z = ZL this is the same as\n0\nsaying x, y \u2208\n/ D\u00b1\nand U never intersects Z).\nProof. If U intersects Z, by positivity of intersections U * Z > 0, and since all other\nterms are non-negative [U ] \u2217 [Z] > 0. Since the asymptotic orbits of Z are elliptic,\nif U, Z share a common asymptotic orbit we would have \u2206(U, Z) > 0. Therefore in\neither case [U ] \u2217 [Z] > 0 by Theorem 3.11. If [U ] \u2217 [Z] = 0 both of these terms must\nbe zero so the converse holds as well.\n\u0003\n3.2. Compactness.

This is because if the second alternative to Lemma 3.16\nholds for (U1k ), the inequality implies [(U1k ] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 1/2. If the first holds, then\nsome level of (U1k ) is asymptotic to L: Lemma 3.16 asserts both that level will have\nstrictly positive intersection, and that each level has non-negative intersection, so\nby level-wise additivity [(U1k )]\u2217[Z] \u2265 1/2 again. It follows that whether or not (U1k )\nhas positive asymptotic orbit in L, the inequality [(U )] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 1/2 holds. Therefore\nthe first alternative to Lemma 3.16 must apply to (U )2 .\nSince the first alternative to Lemma 3.16 holds for (U )2 , [(U )2 ]\u2217[Z] \u2265 0. Lemma\n3.16 implies that for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1, [(U1i )] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 1/2 and that [(U1k )] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 0.\nk\nTherefore 0 = [(U )] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 k\u22121\n2 , and therefore k = 1 i.e (U )1 = (U1 ). Lemma 3.16\nimplies that [(U )1 ] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 0. Since [(U )2 ] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 0, it must be that [(U )2 ] \u2217 [Z] =\n[(U )1 ] \u2217 [Z] = 0. Lemma 3.16 therefore asserts that (U )2 has no planar components\nand is never asymptotic to an orbit in L - because k = 1 it must be that every level\nof (U )2 is a single cylinder. Since [(U )1 ] \u2217 [Z] = 0 and #\u0393\u2212\nfree ((U )1 , L) = 0 (this is\ndefined in Lemma 3.16), the second alternative of Lemma 3.16 cannot hold, so the\nfirst alternative to Lemma 3.16 must apply. It implies that (U )1 also has no planar\ncomponents and is never asymptotic to an orbit in L. Therefore, every level U i for\n(U ) is a cylinder and [U i ] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 0 - it follows by level-wise additivity [U i ] \u2217 [Z] = 0\nfor all levels i, in particular U i \u2208 MJ 0 (a, b : Z).\n\u0003\nIn case (\u03bb+ , L) \u2265 (\u03bb0 , L) \u2265 (\u03bb\u2212 , L) do not necessarily satisfy condition (E) (but\nare each such that L is elliptic), it will be useful in the proof of Theorem 1.5 to\nnote the following.

The proof is similar to the proof of Proposition 3.18. First, by continuity of\nthe intersection number [(U )] \u2217 [Zl ] = 0. Let (U1i ) be the connected components of\n(U )1 . Then\nX\n0 = [(U )] \u2217 [ZL ] = [(U )2 ] \u2217 [ZL ] +\n[(U1i )] \u2217 [ZL ]\n\nLet k be the number of negative punctures of (U )2 , and l = #\u0393\u2212\nfree ((U )2 , L) \u2264\nk \u2212 1 (recall from earlier that this is the number of free negative punctures of (U )2\nasymptotic to a cover of L).

Condition (P LC) prevents bubbling off as follows. Let Uk be a convergent\nsubsequence with limit building (U ). Denote the connected components by U i\n(vertices of the bubble tree) indexed by i \u2208 I. Let S be the underlying nodal\ndomain of the building with components S i corresponding to the U i . By properties\nCHCE2, CHCE3 of SFT-convergence3.3 there are maps \u03c6ik : S i \u2192 R \u00d7 S 1 from S i to\n\u221e\nthe domain of Uk such that Uk \u25e6 \u03c6ik |S i converges to U i in Cloc\n(up to a translation\ni\nin cylindrical levels). Suppose U is a plane for some i. Then by Lemma 3.15 and\ncondition (P LC) [U i ] \u2217 [Z] \u2265 1. It follows that Uk \u25e6 \u03c6ik |S i * Z 6= 0, because Uk \u25e6 \u03c6ik |S i\n\u221e\nconverges to U i in Cloc\nand positivity of intersections implies that all maps C 0 -near\ni\nU intersect Z as well. Therefore int(Uk , Z) 6= 0 and so [Uk ] \u2217 [Z] > 0 contrary to\n\n3.3 These properties are analogs of properties C2, C3 introduced earlier when considering the\ncompactness theorem for cylindrical ends (without splitting along a contact-type hypersurface) we refer to Section 8 of [BEH+ 03] for the precise statements.\n\n\f28\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nthe hypothesis [Uk ] \u2208 M(x+ ; x\u2212 : Z). This shows that the bubble tree is linear\ni.e. all components are cylinders.\nSince x \u2208\n/ L, it is easy to see as follows that no asymptotic orbit between levels\nis in L or not in [a]. If not, there would be a first level U i with positive asymptotic\norbit x0 \u2208 [a] and negative asymptotic orbit y 0 either in L or not in [a]. But \u03c0V \u25e6 U i\nprovides a homotopy between x0 and y 0 , so by condition (P LC) there must be an\n\u221e\n-convergence property\ninterior intersection with L in either case. But then the Cloc\nof SFT convergence cited in the previous paragraph implies by the same argument\nused above that for large k, int(Uk , Z) > 0, which violates Theorem 3.11 since\nUk , ZL have non-identical images and [Uk ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0. After establishing this fact\nabout the asymptotic limits, no U i can have identical image with Z and the same\n\u221e\nCloc\n-convergence argument shows that int(U i , Z) = 0 for each level. The formula\nof Theorem 3.11 shows [U i ] \u2217 [Z] = 0. So [U i ] \u2208 MJ 0 (x0 ; y 0 : Z) and x0 , y 0 \u2208 [a]. \u0003\nRemark 3.21. The same proof goes for the limit of a sequence of such Jk -holomorphic cylinders where the Jk converge in C \u221e to a J \u2208 J (Jb+ , Jb\u2212 : Z); in particular we get a similar statement when considering M{Jl } (1; 1 : Z).\nA similar result holds for a sequence of JR \u2208 J (J1 , J2 ). In the following, suppose\n\u03bb+ \u001f \u03bb0 \u001f \u03bb\u2212 , that (\u03bb+,0,\u2212 , L, [a]) each satisfy (P LC), and that JRk \u2208 J (J1 , J2 )\nwith Rk \u2191 \u221e (where J1 \u2208 J (Jb\u2212 , Jb0 : Z), J2 \u2208 J (Jb0 , Jb+ : Z)).\nProposition 3.22. If (U ) is a SFT-limit of a sequence Uk \u2208 MJRk (x; y : Z) with\nRk \u2191 \u221e and [x] = [y] = [a], then each level U i represents a cylinder [U i ] \u2208 MJ (b; c :\nZ) where [b] = [c] = [a] and J \u2208 {Jb+ (\u03bb+ ), J2 , Jb0 (\u03bb0 ), J1 , Jb\u2212 (\u03bb\u2212 )}.\n\nProof. The proof is similar to the previous proposition. Properties C2, C3 of SFTconvergence and condition (P LC) prohibit the bubbling of planes as in the above\nproof, so each level U i is connected and cylindrical. Similarly, the arguments in the\nsecond paragraph of the proof of Proposition 3.20 prevent any level from intersecting\nZL , prevent any level from being asymptotic to any component of L, and force any\nasymptotic orbit x between levels to be in the homotopy class [a]. So the SFT-limit\nmust have the form stated.\n\u0003\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 1.5, we will require a more general fact. Suppose that\nL satisfies the linking condition of Theorem 1.5, namely:\nL is such that every disc F with boundary \u2202F \u2282 L and [\u2202F ] 6= 0 \u2208\nH1 (L) has an interior intersection with L\nand that [a] is a proper link class for L (Definition 1.3). Suppose only that \u03bb+ , \u03bb0 , \u03bb\u2212\nare each non-degenerate and such that L is closed under the Reeb flows. Then\nProposition 3.23. Consider a sequence Uk of cylinders in MJRk (x; y : Z), with\nRk \u2191 \u221e and [x] = [y] = [a]. Then any SFT-limit (U ) = (U )1 (U )2 is such that\n[(U )1 ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0, [(U )2 ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0, and each component U i of the limit satisfies the\nfollowing properties:\n\u2022 No asymptotic limit of U i is an orbit in L\n\u2022 \u03c0V \u25e6 U i has no interior intersections with L\nIn particular, the compactified images \u03c0V \u25e6 (U ) \u2282 V \\L.\nProof. The assertion that for each component U i that \u03c0V \u25e6 U i has no interior inter\u221e\nsections with L is argued using the Cloc\nconvergence properties of SFT-convergence\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n29\n\nin a familiar way. By properties CHCE2, CHCE33.4 of SFT-convergence there are\nmaps \u03c6ik : S i \u2192 R \u00d7 S 1 from S i = the domain of U i to the domain of Uk such\n\u221e\nthat Uk \u25e6 \u03c6ik |S i converges to U i in Cloc\n(up to a translation in cylindrical levels).\ni\nSince U intersects ZL positively, it follows that Uk must intersect ZL for all k large\nenough, but this contradicts [Uk ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0. So we conclude U i has no interior\nintersections with ZL .\nThe assertion that no asymptotic orbit of any component U i is in L (equivalently, no edge in the bubble tree represents an orbit in L) is argued as follows.\nSuppose some edge E in the bubble tree represents an orbit in L. Suppose first\nthat the portion of the holomorphic building corresponding to the subtree below\nthis edge is planar. Choose an edge E 0 in this subtree such that no edge lower on\nthe bubble tree lies in L (this is possible because the tree is planar so there are\nno free negative asymptotic orbits, thus every edge has a vertex below it). Let\n(P ) be the holomorphic building corresponding to the subtree below this edge E 0 .\nThen \u03c0V \u25e6 (P ) has an interior intersection with L, which must correspond to an\ninterior intersection of one of its components (since no asymptotic orbit is in L),\ncontradicting the first assertion which we have already proved.\nOtherwise, the portion below E has one free negative puncture. E is therefore\non the unique path from the free positive puncture to the free negative puncture.\nWithout loss of generality, suppose E is the highest edge along this path (i.e. closest\nto the positive free puncture). Let (X) be the tree obtained by removing from\nthe original bubble tree the portion below this edge E (by hypothesis E is not\nthe positive free puncture so this is non-empty). By the previous step, any free\nnegative puncture for (X) bounds a planar building (P ) such that each component\nsatisfies the conclusions of this proposition. Hence, its compactified image satisfies\n\u03c0V \u25e6 (P ) \u2282 V \\L. It will now follow that the interior of \u03c0V \u25e6 (X) \u2282 V \\L, since no\nedge of (X) represents an orbit in L (except E) and we have already shown that\nno component of (U ) has an interior intersection with ZL . However, the negative\nasymptotic orbit of (X) is in L (since by hypothesis E represents an orbit in L), and\n\u03c0V \u25e6 (X) realizes a homotopy between this orbit in L and the positive asymptotic\norbit x \u2208 [a] through V \\L. But this contradicts the hypothesis that [a] is a proper\nlink class, by definition. Therefore no such edge E can exist, which finally proves\nthat no asymptotic orbit of any component U i is in L as claimed.\n\u0003\n4. Cylindrical Contact Homology of Complements\nThe two crucial requirements for the definition of contact homology are compactness and regularity of the moduli spaces. Proposition 3.17, 3.20, 3.18, 3.22 supply\nthe required compactness for the spaces MJ (x; y : Z). In the cylindrical case,\nTheorem 2.6 provides the required transversality for the moduli spaces (to prove\n\u2202 2 = 0), but in the non-cylindrical case these arguments do not apply and we need\nto make some hypotheses. When considering non-cylindrical almost-complex structures, we will consider only simple homotopy classes of loops in V \\L. Then following well-known arguments as in e.g. [FHS95, Dra04, Bou06, EKP06], for each fixed\nchoice of cylindrical ends Jb\u00b1 there is a residual subset4.1 Jgen = Jgen (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ : Z)\nof admissible almost-complex structures for which the Cauchy-Riemann operator\n3.4See footnote 3.3.\n4.1One should specify a Banach space of perturbations; the procedure is now standard so we\n\nrefer to [FHS95, Dra04, EKP06]. The key point is that each holomorphic cylinder with a positive\n\n\f30\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nwill be regular for all J-holomorphic cylinders connecting loops in simple classes\n[a] if J \u2208 Jgen . Similarly, there are generic paths of almost-complex structures\nJ\u03c4,gen = J\u03c4,gen (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ : Z).\n\n4.1. Boundary Maps; Chain maps and homotopies. With the properties\nof intersections from Section 3.1, we can describe our cylindrical contact chain\ncomplex on V \\L in detail and show that it has the required properties. The proofs\nof Propositions 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 stated below are postponed to the end of the section.\nSuppose (\u03bb, L) satisfies (E), or that (\u03bb, L, [a]) satisfies (P LC), and choose J \u2208\nJgen (\u03bb). Let Z = ZL be the cylinders over L (Z = \u03c0V\u22121 (L)). Let G denote the\nset of SFT-good Reeb orbits, and G 0 denote G\\L. Let I be an ideal in ker(c1 (\u03be))\nwhere c1 (\u03be) : H2 (V ; Z) \u2192 Z is the first Chern class of \u03be, and\nbe the ring\nP let[AR\nR = Q[H2 (V ; Z)/I]. We will denote elements of R as sums\nqi e i ] , where qi \u2208\nQ, {Ai } \u2282 H2 (V ; Z) is a finite set and [Ai ] denotes its image in the quotient\nH2 (V ; Z)/I. Consider the R-module CC\u2217 (\u03bb rel L) freely generated by elements qx\n(one for each x \u2208 G 0 ). When considering (P LC) we only consider orbits in the\n[a]\nhomotopy class [a] and denote it by CC\u2217 (\u03bb rel L) instead. Grade the module\nas in [EGH00]. Recall from [EGH00] that this also determines a homology class\nA \u2208 H2 (V ; Z) for each asymptotically cylindrical curve U , and we denote by MA\nJ\nthe moduli space of solutions representing the class A.\nDefine a degree \u22121 map \u2202L = \u2202L (J) on the generators of CC\u2217 (\u03bb rel L) (resp.\n[a]\nCC\u2217 (\u03bb rel L)) by summing over index 1 solutions (and extend linearly):\nX\n\nnA\nxy =\n\n[U ]\u2208MA\nJ (x;y:Z)\n\n(4.1)\n\nnxy =\n\nX\n\nA\u2208H2 (V ;Z)\n\n\u2202L qx =\n\nX\n\nmx *\n\n\u000f([U ])\ncov([U])\n\n[A]\nnA\n\u2208R\nxy e\n\nnxy qy\n\ny\u2208G 0\n\nHere mx denotes the covering number of the orbit x, and cov(U) denotes the covering number of the map U . The sign \u000f[U ] = \u00b11 is determined by comparing a\nchoice of coherent orientation [BM04] with the canonical orientation given by the\nfree R-action (it is well-defined since both asymptotic orbits are SFT-good). Since\nthe moduli spaces we consider are open/closed subsets of the moduli space for\n(V, J), a coherent orientation chosen in the usual way will restrict to one for our\nmoduli spaces and it does not require further comment (see [BM04] or [EGH00] for\ndetails). Though we suppressed it in the notation, it is an essential ingredient in\nthe above definition. This sum will always be finite by compactness (Proposition\n3.17, or 3.20) and transversality (Theorem 2.6).\nProposition 4.1. Under the above hypotheses \u2202L2 = 0. Denote the chain complex\n[a]\n(CC\u2217 (\u03bb rel L), \u2202L (J)) by CC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L) (or CC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L) for (P LC)).\nand negative puncture which is not a cover of a cylinder in Z has a point of injectivity outside\nW+ \u222a W\u2212 \u222a Z where we are free to infinitesimally perturb the almost-complex structure.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n31\n\nUnder hypothesis (E), the complex splits according to homotopy classes of loops\nin V \\L:\nM\n[a]\nCC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L) =\nCC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L)\n[a]\u2208\u03c00 (\u03a9V )\n\nWe remark that this is the usual definition of the cylindrical contact homology\nchain complex for the pair (\u03bb|V \\L , J|V \\L ) on V \\L.\n4.1.1. Chain maps.

We will denote their boundary maps \u2202L (J\u00b1 ) when it is\nneeded to clarify. Also, we use G 0 (\u03bb\u00b1 ) to denote the set of SFT-good Reeb orbits\nnot in L.\nChoose and fix a J \u2208 Jgen (Jb\u2212 , Jb+ : Z).

The proofs of Proposition 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 are standard in contact homology\n(see [EGH00] sections 1.9.1, 1.9.2); the only parts that need to be verified are that\nthe moduli spaces have the correct boundary structure, which is done as follows:\n\u2022 Each proof involves the count of two level holomorphic buildings of cylinders, each in M(1; 1 : ZL ). For example, in the proof \u2202 2 = 0, one counts\npairs of index 1 cylinders in MJ (1; 1 : ZL ) which can be concatenated,\nU1 U2 . By level-wise additivity (Proposition 3.8), this configuration also\nhas intersection number 0 with ZL .\n\u2022 After choosing asymptotic markers, the pair can be glued, and by SFTcontinuity of the intersection number (Lemma 3.10), the glued cylinders\nmust be in M(1; 1 : ZL ).\n\u2022 By index additivity and transversality, the glued solutions belong to a connected component of the moduli space diffeomorphic to an interval (after\nquotienting the free R-action in the R-invariant case). By homotopy invariance of the intersection number it is a subset of M(1; 1 : ZL ).\n\u2022 At the other end of the interval, there is an SFT-limit. The compactness\nPropositions 3.17 and 3.20 show that the limit is necessarily a broken trajectory with each cylinder in M(1; 1 : ZL ) again; transversality implies\n4.3Again, everything must be oriented appropriately, the details of which we omit. Also,\nby \"index 0\" we refer to the total Fredholm index including the parameter \u03bc: this means that\nInd(\u03bc, U) = Ind(U) + 1, so we mean that Ind(U) = \u22121.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n33\n\nthere are only two levels and determines the index of both cylinders, so it\nrepresents an object corresponding to another term in the algebraic identity.\n\u2022 Comparison of the orientations shows that the terms representing opposite\nends of the moduli space cancel, proving the required algebraic identity\n(Proposition 4.1, 4.2, or 4.3).\nIn the cylindrical case the required transversality for non-simple curves is guaranteed by Theorem 2.6, so \u2202L2 = 0 even in non-simple homotopy classes [a].\nIt is clear that all maps preserve the class [a]; else, some curve in the count (say\n[U ]) is such that \u03c0V \u25e6 U intersects L, but then [U ] \u2217 [Z] > 0 because int(U, Z) 6= 0\n(see Theorem 3.11), contradicting [U ] \u2208 MJ (1; 1 : Z).\n\u0003\n4.2. Consequences of chain maps/homotopies. The following proposition implies Theorem 1.4 as an obvious corollary; most of it follows already from Propositions 4.1, 4.2, 4.3:\nProposition 4.4. Given (\u03bb+ , L) \u2265 (\u03bb\u2212 , L) both satisfying (E), and a simple class\n[a] of loops in V \\L: for each generic J \u2208 Jgen (\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ : ZL ) there is a chain map\n[a]\n\n[a]\n\n[a]\n\n\u03a6\u2212+ (J) : CC\u2217 (\u03bb+ , J+ rel L) \u2192 CC\u2217 (\u03bb\u2212 , J\u2212 rel L)\n[a]\n\n[a]\n\nMoreover, given two such chain maps \u03a6\u2212+ (J1 ), \u03a6\u2212+ (J2 ) and a generic homotopy\nJ\u03c4 \u2208 J\u03c4,gen (\u03bb\u2212 , \u03bb+ : ZL ), there is a chain homotopy operator K(J\u03c4 ) i.e.\n[a]\n\n[a]\n\n\u03a6\u2212+ (J1 ) \u2212 \u03a6\u2212+ (J2 ) = K(J\u03c4 ) \u25e6 \u2202+ + K(J\u03c4 ) \u25e6 \u2202\u2212\n\nTherefore, there are natural maps in homology\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[a]\n[a]\n[a]\n\u03a6\u2212+ : CCH\u2217 (\u03bb+ , J+ rel L) \u2192 CCH\u2217 (\u03bb\u2212 , J\u2212 rel L)\n\u2217\n\nwhich furthermore satisfy\n\n[a]\n\n[a]\n\n[a]\n\n(\u03a6\u22120 )\u2217 \u25e6 (\u03a60+ )\u2217 = (\u03a6\u2212+ )\u2217\n\nIf (\u03bb\u2212 , L) \u2261 (\u03bb+ , L) then this map is an isomorphism.\nSimilarly, if (\u03bb+ , L, [a]) \u223c (\u03bb\u2212 , L, [a]) both satisfy (P LC) and [a] is simple then\n[a]\nfor each generic J as above there is a chain map \u03a6\u2212+ (J), and given two such\nmaps and a generic homotopy between them J\u03c4 there is a chain homotopy K(J\u03c4 )\nsatisfying the above identity, so there are natural maps\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[a]\n[a]\n[a]\n\u03a6\u2212+ : CCH\u2217 (\u03bb+ , J+ rel L) \u2192 CCH\u2217 (\u03bb\u2212 , J\u2212 rel L)\n\u2217\n\nwhich obey the above composition law and are also isomorphisms.\n\nProof. The proof of Proposition 4.4 is complete once the composition law is verified\nand we prove that the chain maps give isomorphisms. The composition law is verified by a gluing/compactness argument, and we only need to check that we have\ncompactness under stretching and enough transversality; the required compactness\nis guaranteed by Propositions 3.18, 3.22, and the required transversality is guaranteed by choosing J1 , J2 \u2208 Jgen and considering only simple homotopy classes\nof loops. Once the composition law is verified, one considers the compositions\n(\u03a6\u2212+ (J1 ) \u25e6 \u03a6+\u2212 (J2 ))\u2217 \u223c\n= (\u03a6\u2212\u2212 )\u2217 , and (\u03a6+\u2212 (J2 ) \u25e6 \u03a6\u2212+ (J1 ))\u2217 \u223c\n= (\u03a6++ )\u2217 (under\ncondition (E), both compositions can only be made if (\u03bb+ , L) \u2261 (\u03bb\u2212 , L), hence\nthe hypothesis in Proposition 4.4). Using a cylindrical almost-complex structure\nwe find that (\u03a6\u00b1\u00b1 )\u2217 is the identity map. This proves the maps (\u03a6\u00b1\u2213 )\u2217 are both\ninjective and surjective and therefore isomorphisms.\n\u0003\n\n\f34\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nRemark 4.5. We would like to point out that the condition \"[a] is simple\" can\nbe relaxed to the condition \"[a] is such that, for one of \u03bb\u00b1 , all closed Reeb orbits\nin [a] are simple\". First, the chain complexes are defined even for [a] not simple.\nThen the condition that one of \u03bb\u00b1 has only simple closed orbits in [a] guarantees\nthat holomorphic cylinders in a cobordism used to define the chain maps above\nare somewhere injective [HWZ96, Sie08] (hence also have an open set of somewhere injective points), and therefore chain maps/homotopies can be constructed\nfor almost-complex structures in Jgen just as above. The conclusion of Proposition\n4.4 holds even if the contact form at the opposite end of the cobordism has multiply\ncovered Reeb orbits in [a]. We will use this observation in Section 6.\n4.3. Action filtration. As in Morse theory, the chain complexes can be filtered\n[a],\u2264N\n[a]\nby action. We consider the subspace RCC\u2217\n(\u03bb, J rel L) of CC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L) generated by orbits with action A(x) = x \u03bb \u2264 N . By Stokes' theorem, the differential\ndecreases the action. For A \u2264 B (one may take B = \u221e as well here) there are\nnatural chain maps\n[a],\u2264A\n\n\u03b9B,A : CC\u2217\n\n[a],\u2264B\n\n(\u03bb, J rel L) \u2192 CC\u2217\n\n(\u03bb, J rel L),\n\nqx 7\u2192 qx\n\nand clearly \u03b9C,B \u25e6 \u03b9B,A = \u03b9C,A . The morphisms \u03a6 and homotopies K respect the\n[a]\n[a]\nfiltration: specifically, given \u03a610 : CC\u2217 (\u03bb0 , J0 rel L) \u2192 CC\u2217 (\u03bb1 , J1 rel L)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[a],\u2264A\n[a],\u2264A\n\u03a610 CC\u2217\n(\u03bb0 , J0 rel L) \u2282 CC\u2217\n(\u03bb1 , J1 rel L)\n\nagain by Stokes' theorem, and any two such maps (defined by different choices of\nJ) are chain homotopic.\n[a],\u2264N\nIn fact, in order to construct CC\u2217\n(\u03bb, J rel L) with N < \u221e one only requires\nthat \u03bb satisfies (E) up to action N . This means that the assertion (E) (resp. (P LC))\nabout contractible in V \\L Reeb orbits holds for orbits with action less than or equal\n[a]\nto N . Then even though CC\u2217 (\u03bb rel L) may not be defined, for every A < N one\ncan define the chain complexes\n[a],\u2264A\n\nCC\u2217\n\n(\u03bb, J rel L)\n\nas above, and they are filtered by the action in the same way. This follows exactly\nas the construction of the above chain complexes. The proofs of compactness are\ncarried out as straightforward extensions of Propositions 3.17, 3.18, 3.20, 3.22, using\nthe fact that any contractible (in V \\L) Reeb orbit has action greater than N to\nrule out bubbling for moduli spaces of holomorphic cylinders. The Fredholm theory\nremains the same. We will use these filtered chain complexes later.\n5. Forms with degeneracies\nIt is possible to obtain existence results which include cases where the form \u03bb may\nbe degenerate or have closed orbits which are contractible in V \\L, namely Theorem\n1.5. The strategy is to take a sequence of small perturbations of a degenerate form\nto sufficiently non-degenerate approximating forms and deduce the existence of\nclosed Reeb orbit for the approximating forms by a stretching argument. Then,\nusing the action filtration to bound the action of the orbits found this the way\n(which provides C 1 -bounds), the Arzela-Ascoli theorem is used to find the desired\nReeb orbit for the original degenerate form.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n35\n\nWe will also briefly justify the use of the Morse-Bott complex (when \u03bb satisfies\n[a]\n(P LC) or (E) but is Morse-Bott non-degenerate) to compute CCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel L) for\nL 6= \u2205\n5.1. Perturbing degenerate contact forms. The following Lemma is based on\nthe proof in [CH08a] Lemma 7.1 (pages 36-37) of the fact that non-degeneracy is\ndense.\nLemma 5.1. Suppose (\u03bb, L) is such that L consists of non-degenerate closed Reeb\norbits for \u03bb (including multiple covers). Given any N > 0, there is a sequence\n\u03bbn = fn * \u03bb \u2192 \u03bb (i.e. fn \u2192 1 in C \u221e (V ; R)) such that (\u03bbn , L) \u2261 (\u03bb, L) and such\nthat all periodic orbits of the Reeb vector field for \u03bbn of action at most N are\nnon-degenerate.\nProof. Around each Reeb orbit x of action at most N choose neighborhoods x \u2282\nUx \u2282 Vx \u2282 V satisfying\n(1) For all such x, Vx \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 D2 (2), and in these coordinates Ux \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 D2 (1)\n2\n(2) The Reeb vector field X\u03bb is transverse to the pages {t} \u00d7 D (2) of Vx\n(3) For all t \u2208 S 1 , any orbit starting at a point {t} \u00d7 D2 (1) (i.e. starting at a\npoint in Ux ) stays inside Vx for at least time N + 1, and thus at least until\nthe first return to {t} \u00d7 D2 (2) which occurs before N + \u000f\nIf x \u2208\n/ L is an orbit of action at most N , then we choose Vx so that, in addition,\nVx \u2229 L = \u2205. Moreover, select the neighborhoods VLi around the components Li\nof L such that the VLi are mutually disjoint and contain no other orbits of period\nat most N in VLi (other than iterates of Li ). This is possible because the Li and\ncovers are assumed non-degenerate.\nBy the Arzel\u00e0-Ascoli theorem, the set \u0393N of periodic orbits of action at most N\nis compact. By the compactness of the orbit set, it is not difficult to see that the\nimage of these orbits in V (also denoted \u0393N ) may be covered by finitely many of\nthe above sets Ui , i.e. \u0393N \u2282 U1 \u222a * * * \u222a Uk . Order them so that U1 , . . . , Um are the\nneighborhoods of the form ULi \u2282 VLi for components Li of L among {U1 , . . . , Uk }.\nWe modify \u03bb on V1 , . . . , Vk so that there are no degenerate orbits of period\nat most N in these Vi by the method of [CH08a] Lemma 7.1. Choose any of the\nneighborhood pairs (Ui , Vi ). Let U be any neighborhood of \u03bb. The proof in [CH08a]\nshows how one can find a form \u03bb0 \u2208 U such that\n(1) \u03bb0 differs from \u03bb only on a compact subset of Vi ,\n(2) any \u03bb0 orbit that originates in Ui of action at most N remains in Vi for time\nN + 1 \u2212 \u000f,\n(3) all closed orbits of period at most N contained in Ui are non-degenerate,\n(4) there are no closed orbits of action at most N originating in the complement\nSk\nV \\ j=1 Uj (for \u03bb0n sufficiently near \u03bb); therefore all closed orbits are still\nSk\ncontained in j=1 Uj .\n\nProceeding one neighborhood pair at a time, one finds a form \u03bbi \u2208 U such that\nSk\nSi\nj=1 Uj still covers all the closed Reeb orbits, but all closed Reeb orbits in\nj=1 Uj\nare non-degenerate (the above procedure shows how to make all Reeb orbits in\nSk\nUi non-degenerate without introducing new ones in V \\ j=1 Uj , and by choosing\nthe perturbation small enough all Reeb orbits contained in Uj for j \u2264 i remain\nnon-degenerate). The form \u03bbk will be the desired form.\n\n\f36\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nHowever, we have to take care about the perturbations so that they satisfy\nthe conclusions stated above. By hypothesis all periodic orbits originating in\nU1 , . . . , Um of period at most N are non-degenerate, by the choice of the VLi and\nthe choice of the ordering. In this case, in the above process we do not need to\nperturb the form for the first m steps, i.e. we can take \u03bbm = \u03bb. In subsequent\nSi\nsteps, the new perturbations \u03bbi , i > m differ from \u03bbm only on j=m+1 Vj , which is\ndisjoint from L by choice; in particular there is a neighborhood N containing L on\nwhich \u03bbi |N = \u03bb|N . Therefore in the end (\u03bbk , L) \u2261 (\u03bb, L).\nTo summarize, for any neighborhood U of \u03bb, there is a \u03bb0 such that\n(1) \u03bb0 has only non-degenerate periodic orbits of period at most N contained\nin U1 \u222a * * * \u222a Uk .\nSk\n(2) \u03bb0 has no periodic orbits of period at most N which enter V \\ i=1 Ui .\n0\n0\n(3) There is a neighborhood N of L such that \u03bb |N = \u03bb|N , thus (\u03bb , L) \u2261 (\u03bb, L)\n\nThe desired sequence is obtained by choosing a countable neighborhood basis Un\nat \u03bb and choosing \u03bbn \u2208 Un as above.\n\u0003\nLet [(\u03bb, L)] denote the subset of the set of (positive) contact forms \u03bc for \u03be (which\nwe will denote \u039b(\u03be)) such that (\u03bc, L) \u2261 (\u03bb, L), equipped with the C \u221e topology as a\nsubspace of \u039b(\u03be). It is a closed subset of \u039b(\u03be) so its topology can be obtained from\na complete metric space structure on it. Let us denote by \u039bgen (\u03be) the set of nondegenerate contact forms - as is well-known this is the intersection of a countable\nset of open dense sets (a G\u03b4 ), and therefore dense in \u039bgen (\u03be). Then in fact\nLemma 5.2. Suppose \u03bb is such that all orbits in L are non-degenerate. The set\n[(\u03bb, L)]gen := {\u03bc|\u03bc \u2208 [(\u03bb, L)], \u03bc \u2208 \u039bgen (\u03be)}\nis the intersection of a countable collection of open, dense sets (in [(\u03bb, L)]) and\ntherefore also dense.\ng\nProof. Let G\nN denote the subset of \u039b(\u03be) for which all periodic orbits of action \u2264 N\ng\nare non-degenerate, and GN = G\nN \u2229 [(\u03bb, L)]. The argument of [CH08a] Lemma\ng\n7.1 shows that GN is open in \u039b(\u03be), and therefore GN is also open in the subspace\n[(\u03bb, L)]. In the previous Lemma it was shown that GN is dense in [(\u03bb, L)]. The\nconclusion follows from the observation that\n[(\u03bb, L)]gen =\n\n\u221e\n\\\n\nGN\n\nN =1\n\nis a G\u03b4 .\n\n\u0003\n\nFinally, we note the following\nLemma 5.3. If \u03bb is a contact form and L is a closed link for the Reeb vector field,\nthen in any C \u221e -neighborhood U of \u03bb there is a \u03bb0 such that (\u03bb0 , L) \u223c (\u03bb, L) and\neach component of L (including multiple covers) is non-degenerate for \u03bb0 .\nThis can be achieved by an arbitrarily small perturbation to the 2-jet of \u03bb along\nL (leaving the 1-jet unperturbed so L is still tangent to the Reeb vector field).\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n37\n\n5.2. The proof of the implied existence Theorem 1.5. We prove Theorem\n1.5:\nProof. Let \u03bb0 be any form such that L is closed for the Reeb vector field and\nelliptic non-degenerate. Suppose (\u03bb, L) \u2261 (\u03bb0 , L) is non-degenerate and satisfies\n(E), and by rescaling if necessary that \u03bb0 \u227a \u03bb. Choose a constant c such that\nalso c\u03bb \u227a \u03bb0 . Choose J \u2208 Jgen (\u03bb), J 0 \u2208 Jgen (\u03bb0 ), and J1 \u2208 Jgen (J, J 0 : ZL ),\nJ0 \u2208 Jgen (J 0 , J : ZL ) (to be specific J0 is equal to J on W \u2212 (c\u03bb)). Then we have\nthe path JR , R \u2265 0 of almost-complex structures in the symplectization splitting\nalong \u03bb0 to (W\u03be , J0 ) (W\u03be , J1 ).\nClaim: for each R sufficiently large there is a JR -holomorphic cylinder U such\nthat [U ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0 with positive asymptotic orbit having \u03bb-action at most N and\nasymptotic limits in [a]. To see why this is so, we may find a sequence Jn \u2192 JR\nwith each Jn \u2208 Jgen (since Jgen is Baire), and each such defines a morphism\n\u03a6(Jn ) : CC [a],\u2264N (\u03bb, J rel L) \u2192 CC [a],\u2264N (c * \u03bb, J rel L)\nSuch a chain map is chain homotopic to the morphism obtained from a cylindrical\nb which can be identified with inclusion\nalmost-complex structure J,\n\u03b9N/c,N : CC [a],\u2264N (\u03bb, J rel L) \u2192 CC [a],\u2264N (c * \u03bb, J rel L) \u223c\n= CC [a],\u2264N/c (\u03bb, J rel L)\nqx 7\u2192 qx\n\nso \u03a6(Jn ) is non-zero if the homology is non-zero. Let q be a \u2202J -closed element\n[a]\nof CC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L) generated by orbits of action \u2264 N such that [q] 6= 0 when\n[a]\nconsidered as an element of CCH\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L). Since \u03a6(Jn ) is chain homotopic to\nthe identity and q is closed but not exact, it is easy to deduce that \u03a6(Jn )(q) 6= 0,\nso there must be a Jn finite energy holomorphic cylinder Un with [Un ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0\nand positive asymptotic orbit of action at most N . Taking a SFT-limit as n \u2192 \u221e,\nby Proposition 3.17 (and using the fact that (\u03bb, L), (c\u03bb, L) satisfy (E)) we obtain\na JR -holomorphic cylindrical building, which has a component UR which is a JR holomorphic cylinder with [UR ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0, positive asymptotic orbit of action at\nmost N , and asymptotic limits in [a] as claimed.\nSince R was arbitrary, we make take a sequence of JRn finite energy cylinders, Un , with Rn \u2191 \u221e, each with positive asymptotic orbit of action at most\nN , [Un ] \u2217 [ZL ] = 0, and both asymptotic limits in [a]. To continue, first suppose\nthat \u03bb0 is non-degenerate up to action N . Then by SFT-compactness we obtain\na limit holomorphic building (U ) = (U )0 (U )1 in (W\u03be , J0 ) (W\u03be , J1 ). Proposition 3.19 asserts that the compactified image \u03c0V \u25e6 (U ) \u2282 V \\L. The image is a\npiecewise-smooth cylinder with one boundary component equal to x and the other\nboundary component equal to y. Suppose (U )1 has k free negative punctures. Let\n(U )10 , . . . , (U )k\u22121\nbe the planar components of (U )0 . Consider now the connected\n0\nsub-building\n\u0001\n(X) = (U )10 + . . . (U )k\u22121\n(U )1\n0\n\nwith one free negative puncture which is a negative asymptotic orbit for (U )1 , and\ntherefore a closed Reeb orbit for \u03bb0 , say z. The compactified image \u03c0V \u25e6 (X) is\na compact cylinder with boundary components x and z and image \u2282 V \\L, and\ntherefore [z] = [x] = [a]. Thus z is the desired closed \u03bb0 -Reeb orbit in [a] with\naction at most N (since action is non-increasing as one descends levels).\n\n\f38\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nTo conclude in the case \u03bb0 is degenerate, select \u03bb0n \u2192 \u03bb0 in C \u221e with (\u03bb0n , L) \u2261\n(\u03bb , L) such that \u03bb0n is non-degenerate up to action N by Lemma 5.2. For each n\nsufficiently large we obtain a closed \u03bb0n -Reeb orbit xn as above (since eventually\n\u03bb0n \u227a \u03bb). Applying the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, we obtain a closed \u03bb0 -Reeb orbit x as\na C \u221e limit of the xn . x cannot be a l-fold cover of a component of L for any l \u2265 1,\nbecause if it were then one could show that 1 is an eigenvalue for the corresponding\nlinearized lth-return map of the Reeb flow, contradicting the hypothesis that each\ncover of L is elliptic non-degenerate. It follows easily that [x] = [a], since xn \u2192 x in\nC \u221e , any loop C 0 -close enough to x is in the same homotopy class as x, and every\nxn \u2208 [a]. The orbit x also has action at most N .\nIf instead L satisfies the linking condition of the Theorem and [a] is a proper\nlink class for L, select any (\u03bb0 , L, [a]) satisfying (P LC). Assuming first \u03bb is nondegenerate, repeat the above argument using Proposition 3.23 instead. To pass\nto the degenerate case, use Lemmas 5.3, 5.2 to similarly find approximating nondegenerate Reeb vector fields and a sequence of orbits xn \u2208 [a] with xn \u2192 x with\nx a closed \u03bb Reeb orbit. It is clear that x cannot be a cover of a component of L\nsince no sequence of loops in [a] can converge to a cover of a component of L: this\nis because [a] is a proper link class relative to L.\n\u0003\n0\n\n5.3. A brief justification of Morse-Bott computations. Suppose that \u03bb satisfies (E) and is Morse-Bott non-degenerate (a similar argument will work if \u03bb\nsatisfies (P LC) instead). Choose a Morse function on the Reeb orbit sets of \u03bb.\n[a]\nThe Morse-Bott chain complex CC\u2217 (\u03bb, J rel L) is generated by critical points of\nthe Morse function chosen on the orbit sets, removing the generators corresponding\nto Reeb orbits with image in L. The differential counts generalized holomorphic\ncylinders (holomorphic cylinders between orbit sets with cascades along the gradient flow lines of the Morse function, described in detail in [Bou02]) of index 1 which\nneither intersect nor are asymptotic to L.\nUsing the perturbation of Lemma 2.3 of [Bou02] one finds, given any N > 0\nand C \u221e -neighborhood of \u03bb, a form \u03bbN (which in fact only differs from \u03bb on an\narbitrarily small tubular neighborhood the orbits sets of action at most N + 1) such\nthat\n\u2022 \u03bbN is in the C \u221e -neighborhood chosen\n\u2022 All closed orbits that have period at most N + 1 correspond to critical\npoints of a Morse function on the orbit sets of \u03bb and are non-degenerate.\n\u2022 There are no contractible (in V \\L) Reeb orbits of period at most N (because a sequence of such orbits for a sequence of forms converging to \u03bb\nwould produce a contractible in V \\L Reeb orbit for \u03bb of action at most N\nby Arzela-Ascoli, contradicting hypotheses)\nSuch forms can be given explicitly in terms of the Morse functions on the orbit\nset in [Bou02]. Given such a \u03bbN , one may construct the cylindrical chain complex\n(for generic JN and Morse functions)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n[a],\u2264N\nCC\u2217\n(\u03bbN ), \u2202(\u03bbN , JN )\nFor any fixed N , choosing a sequence of such \u03bbn \u2192 \u03bb (with corresponding Jn \u2192 J),\nthe work of [Bou02] guarantees that for large n the cylindrical contact chain complex\ngenerated by orbits of action at most N is canonically identified with the Morse-Bott\ncomplex for (\u03bb, J) generated by the orbit sets of action at most N , so this portion of\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n39\n\nthe homology can be canonically identified. It is not difficult to see that a sequence\nUn of Jn -holomorphic cylinders with Un \u2217 ZL = 0 will converge to a generalized\nholomorphic cylinder of the type used to construct the differential above. Similarly,\nif any sequence converges to such a generalized holomorphic cylinder, it is easy to\nsee that lim Un \u2217 ZL = 0.

Examples in S 3\nWe will use two approaches to computing contact homology on some orbit complements in S 3 . The first is to use an integrable model for which the dynamics\nare known precisely, usually because of some symmetry, and compute using the\nsymmetry to make deductions about holomorphic curves as well. The Morse-Bott\ntechnique introduced in [Bou02] is a particularly useful tool when computing using\nsuch an approach. The second technique is to use open book decompositions (an approach used in [CH08a] to compute contact homology for a large class of examples).\nIn this section we will give sample computations using both approaches.\nSince H2 (S 3 ; Z) = 0 we can use Q as the coefficient ring for all chain complexes,\nand a global trivialization of the contact structure is used to compute all ConleyZehnder indices (and thus to grade the chain complexes) for the tight contact\nstructure.\n6.1. Computations with Morse-Bott contact forms. First, consider the \"irrational ellipsoids\" (Example 1.2).

Given such a \u03b3, we define the surface S = S\u03b3 as (where ri , \u03b8i ,\ni = 1, 2, are polar coordinates in each R2 factor of R4 = R2 \u00d7 R2 ):\nS = S\u03b3 = {(r1 , \u03b81 , r2 , \u03b82 ) \u2208 R4 |(r12 , r22 ) \u2208 \u03b3}\n\nwith the contact form \u03bb0 = \u03bb0 |S . Alternately, it can be viewed as the contact form\nf 2 * \u03bb0 on S 3 = {r12 + r22 = 1}, where f : S 3 \u2192 (0, \u221e) satisfies f (z) * z \u2208 S\u03b3 . There\nare closed orbits H1 = S 3 \u2229 C \u00d7 {0} and H2 = S 3 \u2229 {0} \u00d7 C.\nThe closed orbits H1 and H2 have Conley-Zehnder indices\nCZ(H1k ) = 2bk(1 + \u03b81 )c + 1,\n\nCZ(H2k ) = 2bk(1 + 1/\u03b82 )c + 1\n\nIt is not difficult to convince oneself that, once given real numbers \u03b81 , \u03b82 , such\na curve \u03b3 can be constructed. If \u03b81 = \u03b82 > 0 are irrational, if one took \u03b3 to be a\nstraight line then S would be the irrational ellipsoid (though, strictly speaking, it\nviolates the hypothesis that y 0 /x0 be strictly monotone).\nFirst we will show that S is a smooth, star-shaped hypersurface with respect to\nthe origin in R4 . Let H(x, y) be any smooth function such that H \u25e6 \u03b3 \u2261 1 and\n\u2207H 6= 0 along \u03b3. Then S is realized as the set H(r12 , r22 ) = 1 (at least in some\nneighborhood of S). We compute\nr1 \u2202r1 + r2 \u2202r2 \u00acd(H(r12 , r22 ))\n\n= r1 \u2202r1 + r2 \u2202r2 \u00ac2r1 (\u2202x H)(r12 , r22 )dr1 + 2r2 (\u2202y H)(r12 , r22 )dr2\n\u0001\n= 2 r12 (\u2202x H) + r22 (\u2202y H)\n\nHowever, since dH \u25e6\u03b3 0 \u2261 0 we mush have that \u2207H(\u03b3(t)) is proportional to j *\u03b3 0 (t) =\n(y 0 (t), \u2212x0 (t)) (since this vector is perpendicular to (x0 , y 0 )) and therefore, using\nx(t) = r12 , y(t) = r22 , the previous line is proportional to\n2(x(y 0 ) + y(\u2212x0 )) = 2(x * y 0 \u2212 y * x0 ) > 0\n\nThe proportionality constant is nowhere zero, so we see that the original quantity\nis nowhere vanishing and we can conclude that dH 6= 0 and hence S is a smooth\nhypersurface in R4 . The radial vector field r1 \u2202r1 + r2 \u2202r2 is transverse to S and\ntherefore S is star-shaped with respect to the origin. Since the radial vector field\nis Liouville, the hypersurface is of contact type.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n41\n\nr22\n\nr22\n\nSlope = \u03b82\n\nSlope =\n\n\"\n\nr12 \u2212\n\n\"\n\n#2\n\nr12 \u2212 \u221a 1\n\n\u03b82\n\n\u221a1 2\n1+\u03b82\n\nSlope (\u03b3 0)\u22a5\n\n1+\u03b822\n\n#2\n\nSlope (\u03b3 0)\u22a5\n\n\"\n\n1+\u03b812\n\n#2\n\n=1\n\nr22\n\"\n\nSlope =\n\nr22\n\nSlope = \u03b82\n\n=1\n\n+ r22 + \u221a \u03b81\n\n#2\n\nSlope= \u03b81 r12\n\n\"\n\n+ r22 \u2212\n\n\u221a \u03b81 2\n1+\u03b81\n\nSlope= \u03b81\n\nr12\n\nr12 \u2212 \u221a 1\n1+\u03b822\n\n\u03b82\n\n#2\n\"\n\n+ r22 + \u221a \u03b81\n\nr12 + \u221a 1\n\n\"\n\n1+\u03b822\n\n#2\n\nSlope (\u03b3 0)\u22a5\n\n\"\n\n=1\n\n+ r22 + \u221a \u03b81\n\n1+\u03b812\n\n#2\n\nSlope (\u03b3 0)\u22a5\n\nr12\n\n1+\u03b812\n\n=1\n\nSlope= \u03b81\n\n#2\n\nr12\n\nSlope= \u03b81\n\nFigure 6.1.

In particular,\nwe find for each t such that\n(y 0 (t), \u2212x0 (t)) = C * (p, q),\n\nC>0\n\nis rational a torus foliated by closed Reeb orbits. The signs of p, q will be determined by the direction of the vector \u03b3 0 (t). The condition that x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is strictly\nmonotone implies that this torus is Morse-Bott, so we have a Morse-Bott flow on S.\nWe shall see that closed orbits in different tori represent different homotopy classes\nof loops in S 3 \\(H1 t H2 ) (which is homotopy equivalent to T 2 ). In the following,\nlet us denote the homotopy class of loops [a] such that for l \u2208 [a] `(l, H2 ) = p and\n`(l, H1 ) = q by [a] = (p, q) \u2208 Z2 : this classifies the set of homotopy classes of loops\nin S\\(H1 t H2 ).\nLet us more explicitly describe the set of closed characteristics in S. First, the\nknots H1 , H2 corresponding respectively to the sets r2 = 0, r1 = 0 are closed\nReeb orbits on S.

Note that the first and third arcs may be empty. We analyze the\nReeb orbits belonging to points on each arc separately.\nOn the first arc: y 0 (t) > 0, x0 (t) > 0, so the ratio \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is negative and\nincreases until t1 where x0 (t1 ) = 0.\nThen for those t for which \u2212x0 /y 0 is rational and equal to (\u2212q)/p in least terms\n(with p, q > 0), the leaves of the foliation form closed Reeb orbits which link p\ntimes with H2 and \u2212q times with H1 , i.e. it is in the homotopy class (p, \u2212q).\nThis arc is non-empty if and only if \u03b81 < 0. In this case, since \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is\ninitially \u03b81 , and strictly increases. Thus, we find, for each relatively prime positive\npair of integers (p, q) such that\nCZ(H1k ) = 2bk(1 \u2212\n\n\u03b81 < (\u2212q)/p < 0\na unique torus (corresponding to that t(p,\u2212q) for which \u2212x0 (t(p,\u2212q) )/y 0 (t(p,\u2212q) ) =\n(\u2212q)/p) foliated by Reeb orbits in the homotopy class (p, \u2212q).\nOn the second arc: y 0 (t) > 0, x0 (t) < 0, so the ratio y 0 (t)/x0 (t) is negative and\nstrictly increasing until t2 . Either t2 = 1, or, t2 < 1 and y 0 (t2 ) = 0.\nThen, for those t for which \u2212x0 /y 0 is rational and equal to q/p in least terms\n(with p, q > 0, the leaves of the foliation form closed Reeb orbits which link p times\nwith H2 and q times with H1 , i.e. it is in the homotopy class (p, q).\nThis arc is always non-empty. Let us consider the case \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is increasing,\nfirst. If \u03b81 > 0, then \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is initially \u03b81 ; else, it is initially zero. If \u03b82 > 0,\nthen t2 = 1 and \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) tends towards \u03b82 as t \u2192 1\u2212 . Else, t2 < 1 and\n\u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is unbounded.\nThus, we find, for each relatively prime positive pair of integers (p, q) such that\n\u001a\n\u03b82 , if \u03b82 > 0\nmax{0, \u03b81 } < q/p <\n\u221e, if \u03b82 < 0\na unique torus (corresponding to the point \u03b3(t(p,q) ) where \u2212x0 (t(p,q) )/y 0 (t(p,q) ) =\nq/p) foliated by Reeb orbits in the homotopy class (p, q).\nThere is also the possibility that \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) is decreasing, which happens if and\nonly if 0 < \u03b82 < \u03b81 . In this case, we find for each\n\u03b82 =\n\n\u2212x0 (0)\n\u2212x0 (1)\n< q/p = \u2212x0 (t(p,q )/y 0 (t(p,q ) < 0\n= \u03b81\n0\ny (1)\ny (0)\n\nthe torus (r12 , r22 ) = \u03b3(t(p,q) ) foliated by orbits in the homotopy class (p, q).\nOn the third arc: both x0 (t) and y 0 (t) are negative, and y 0 (t)/x0 (t) increases\nstrictly until t = 1.\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n43\n\nFor those t for which \u2212x0 /y 0 is rational and equal to q/(\u2212p) in least terms (with\np, q > 0, the leaves of the foliation form closed Reeb orbits which link \u2212p times\nwith H2 and q times with H1 , i.e. it is in the homotopy class (\u2212p, q).\nThis arc is non-empty if and only if \u03b82 < 0. In this case, \u2212x0 (t)/y 0 (t) tends to\n\u2212\u221e as t \u2192 t+\n2 , and strictly increases to the limiting value \u03b82 as t \u2192 1.

If t1 6= 0, then x0 (t1 ) = 0 and y 0 (t1 ) > 0\nso there will be a torus of closed orbits at \u03b3(t1 ) representing the homotopy class\n(1, 0) (i.e. linking once with H2 and zero times with H1 ). If t2 6= 1, then x0 (t2 ) < 0\nand y 0 (t2 ) = 0 so there will be a torus of closed orbits at \u03b3(t2 ) representing the\nhomotopy class (0, 1) (i.e. linking 0 times with H2 and once with H1 ).\nThus, we can classify the closed characteristics on S as follows:\n(1) If 0 < \u03b81 , \u03b82 then for\nq\n\u2208 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ) t (\u03b82 , \u03b81 )\np\nthere is a torus of closed orbits with each closed orbit representing the\nhomotopy class (p, q);\n(2) If \u03b81 < 0 < \u03b82 , then for each fraction (written in least terms)\nq\n\u2208 (\u03b81 , \u03b82 )\np\n(taking q < 0 when this fraction is negative) there is a torus of simple closed\norbits with each closed orbit representing the homotopy class (p, q);\n(3) If \u03b82 < 0 < \u03b81 , then for each fraction (written in least terms)\np\n1 1\n\u2208( , )\nq\n\u03b82 \u03b81\n(taking p < 0 when this fraction is negative) there is a torus of simple closed\norbits with each closed orbit representing the homotopy class (p, q);\n(4) If \u03b81 , \u03b82 < 0, then for p, q non-negative and relatively prime such that\n\u2212q\n\u2208 (\u03b81 , 0),\np\n\nq\n\u2208 [0, +\u221e],\np\n\nq\n\u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u03b82 )\n\u2212p\n\n(where we consider 1/0 = +\u221e), there is a torus of simple closed orbits with\neach closed orbit representing the homotopy class (p, \u2212q), (p, q) or (\u2212p, q)\n(respectively).\n(5) In each case above, these are all the closed orbits i.e. there are no other\nclosed orbits (besides the closed orbits H1 , H2 ).\n(The reader may have noticed that case (3) above is superfluous, since by interchanging the roles of H1 , H2 it can be realized by case (2).)

Applying the contactomorphism we can assume without loss of generality\nthat (\u03bb, L0 ) \u223c (\u03bb0 , T ) from Example 6.2. Then this follows from Theorem 1.5 and\nthe computation in Example 6.2, since the homotopy class [a] of K (which has the\nhomotopy type of the leafs of the foliation of T(p00 ,q00 ) by the Reeb vector field in\nthat example) is simple and a proper link class relative to T1 t T2 . The hypotheses\nq 00 6= q 0 , p 6= p00 imply that that the linking numbers `(T1 , [a]) 6= `(T1 , T2 ) and\n`(T2 , [a]) 6= `(T2 , T1 ) which ensures that [a] is a proper link class, though [a] might\nbe a proper knot class even if these inequalities are not satisfied.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.4. Similarly, one can consider the cases where at least one of \u03b81 , \u03b82 is\nnegative and obtain an analogous result for certain cases where p, p0 , q, q 0 may be\nnegative.\nIt is also true that (\u03bb0 , T, [Hi ]) satisfies (P LC) for the knots H1 , H2 in Example\n6.1 (the components of the Hopf link) if p0 6= 1 and q 6= 1.

The linearized flow along a closed Reeb orbit z(t) can be\ncomputed with the following result (see e.g. [HP08]). Let \u03c6t denote the Reeb flow.\nLet x0 X2 (z(0)) + y0 X3 (z(0)) be in \u03bez(0) . Let x(t), y(t) solve\nd\u03c6t (z(0)) = x(t)X2 (z(t)) + y(t)X3 (z(t)),\n\nx(0) = x0 , y(0) = y0\n\nThen x(t), y(t) solves the linear system\n\u001a\n\u1e8b = \u2212K(\u03c0 \u25e6 z(t))y\n\u1e8f =\nx\nwhere K : S 2 \u2192 R is determined by the Finsler structure and agrees with the\ncurvature in the Riemannian case.\nPoincar\u00e9's rotation number of a geodesic \u03b3 can be described as [Ang05]\ny2n\n1/\u03c1 = lim\nn\u2192\u221e nL\nwhere yk is the k th positive zero of y(t) which solves\ny 00 + K(\u03b3(t)) * y = 0\nand L is the length of the geodesic. This limit can also be described by\n\u03c1 = lim\n\nN \u2192\u221e\n\nL #{zeros of y \u2208 [0, N ]}\n2\nN\n\nLet z be the closed Reeb orbit which double covers \u03b3, such that z has period T .\nWe will now compare the Conley-Zehnder indices CZ(z k ) to the inverse rotation\nnumber \u03c1. The Conley-Zehnder index of z k satisfies (see, for example, the Appendix\nof [HWZ03])\n|CZ(z k ) \u2212 2\u2206| < 2\n\nIn the above, 2\u03c0\u2206 is the change in argument of the vector (x(t), y(t)) over the paths\ndomain [0, kT ], where (x, y) satisfies the linearized equation associated to z above.\nHowever, if (x, y) solves this equation, then y solves the equation (recall G denotes\nthe double cover)\ny 00 + K(G \u25e6 z(t))y = 0\nMoreover, if there are k zeros of y, then k \u2212 1 < 2\u2206 < k + 1. This claim is a\nconsequence of the following observations. First, we notice that all crossings of the\nx-axis are transverse: this is because if y = 0 and y 0 = 0 then y \u2261 0 by uniqueness\nof solutions. Second, at any crossing, by the differential equation we see that if\ny 0 > 0 then x > 0, and if y 0 < 0 then x < 0; thus each zero contributes a transverse\ncounterclockwise crossing of the path (x(t), y(t)) against the x-axis. So |2\u2206\u2212k| < 1;\nhence (for any k):\n|CZ(z|[0,kT ] ) \u2212 #{zeros of y \u2208 [0, kT ]}| < 3\nSince z has period T , z k has period kT .

One\nsees by explicitly computing its preimage in S 3 that z is an unknotted, self-linking\nnumber \u22121 transverse knot in S 3 (it will be, if \u03b3 is chosen correctly, S 3 \u2229 C \u00d7 {0}).\nSimilarly, the second Reeb orbit w corresponding to \u03b3 is also an unknotted, selflinking number \u22121 transverse knot. Together, the pair forms a Hopf link of selflinking number 0 (if \u03b3 is chosen correctly it will be ({0} \u00d7 C \u222a C \u00d7 {0}) \u2229 S 3 ).\nSince \u03c1 is irrational, z and w are elliptic and Corollary 1.6 applies.

Open book decompositions. Contact forms supporting an open book provide a vast class of examples. Let (\u03c0, B) be an open book decomposition for\n(V, \u03be). This means that B is a transverse link in V (the binding), \u03c0 : V \\B \u2192 S 1\nis a fibration, and every component B 0 \u2282 B has a neighborhood U such that\n\u03c0|U \\B 0 \u223c\n= S 1 \u00d7 \u1e0a2 has the form (t, (r, \u03b8)) 7\u2192 \u03b8 (where (r, \u03b8) are polar coordinates\non the punctured disc). The open book supports a contact structure \u03be if there is a\ncontact form \u03bb (called a supporting contact form) with ker(\u03bb) = \u03be such that\n\u2022 B is a closed for the Reeb vector field\n\u2022 The form d\u03bb is symplectic on the pages \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b8), i.e. d\u03bb|\u03c0\u22121 (\u03b8) > 0, \u2200\u03b8 \u2208 S 1 .\nIn particular, the Reeb vector field is transverse to the pages, so there are no\ncontractible orbits in V \\B. It turns out that every contact structure is supported\nby some open book (in fact, infinitely many [Gir02]).\nWe first check an elementary topological fact:\nLemma 6.6. The binding B satisfies the second condition of Theorem 1.5, namely\nEvery disc F with \u2202F \u2282 B and [\u2202F ] 6= 0 \u2208 H1 (B) intersects B in\nthe interior.\nexcept when the page is a disc.\nProof. Let F be any smoothly map D2 \u2192 V with \u2202F \u2282 B. Suppose that F \u22121 (B) \u2282\n\u2202D2 . Consider the covering map\n\u03c0 : R \u00d7 int(S) \u2192 R \u00d7 int(S)/((t, x) \u223c (t \u2212 1, h(x)) \u223c\n= V \\B\n\ncoming from the open book decomposition. For any r < 1 we may lift F |D2 (r)\nto a map G : D2 (r) \u2192 R \u00d7 int(S), uniquely determined if we choose once and\nfix G(0) \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 {F (0)}. Thus we can in fact define G : int(D2 ) \u2192 R \u00d7 int(S).\nWe may homotopy G to G0 : int(D2 ) \u2192 {0} \u00d7 int(S) \u223c\n= int(S) by scaling the\nR-coordinate. Let N (B) be the tubular neighborhood of B such that N (B)\\B \u223c\n=\nS 1 \u00d7 int(N (\u2202S)) where N ((\u2202S) is a collar neighborhood of \u2202S chosen small enough\nso that the monodromy h|N (\u2202S) is the identity, so we have an inclusion map \u03b9 :\nS 1 \u00d7 int(N (\u2202S)) \u2192 N (B) and F |\u2202D2 (r) = \u03b9 \u25e6 \u03c0 \u25e6 G|\u2202D2 (r) (where r is taken large\nenough so that F |\u2202D2 (r) \u2282 B). Applying the H1 -functor and using the fact that G0\nis homotopic to G and [F |\u2202D2 (r) ] = [F |\u2202D2 ] 6= 0 \u2208 H1 (N (B)) \u223c\n= H1 (B) we have\n0\n\u223c\n(\u03b9 \u25e6 \u03c0)\u2217 [G |\u2202D2 (r) ] = [F |\u2202D2 (r) ] 6= 0 \u2208 H1 (N (B)) = H1 (B)\nFrom this it is easy to conclude that [G0 |\u2202D2 (r) ] = k * [\u2202S] \u2208 H1 (N (\u2202S)) for some\nk 6= 0, and therefore is homotopic to a k-fold cover of \u2202S with k 6= 0; hence G0 |\u2202D2 (r)\n\n\f50\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nis homotopic to k * \u2202S in S. However, G0 |\u2202D2 (r) is null-homotopic in S, while the\nk-fold cover of \u2202S is not if k 6= 0 (unless the page S is a disc). This contradiction\nshows that we cannot have F \u22121 (B) \u2282 \u2202D2 , so F intersects B in the interior.\n\u0003\nExample 6.7. Open Book Decompositions Suppose B supports an open book decomposition (other than the open book decomposition with the disc as the page).\nThen (\u03bb, B, [a]) satisfies (P LC) for any simple proper link class [a] (relative to B):\nany disc bounding a contractible Reeb orbit either links non-trivially with the binding (since the Reeb vector field is transverse to the pages), or is asymptotic to a\ncomponent of the binding (in which case by Lemma 6.6 it has an interior intersection with the binding), and by hypothesis [a] is a proper link class. If the page is\nnot the disc or the annulus, there should be many such [a].\nIf the binding is elliptic non-degenerate then it satisfies (E) as well.\n[a]\n\nIt follows, for simple proper link classes [a] (relative to B), that CCH\u2217 (\u03be rel B)\nis well-defined (where \u03be is the contact structure supported by the open book). In\nparticular, Theorem 1.5 can be applied to any proper link class [a] for the binding\nB.\nIn [CH08a], the authors achieve the much more difficult task of computing the\ncylindrical contact homology of the manifold (V, \u03be) when it is defined. For V \\B the\nsituation is considerably simpler. First, cylindrical contact homology of the complement will always defined (at least for simple homotopy classes), and independent\nof the equivalence classes [\u03bb] of \u2261 in proper link classes relative to B. Second,\nwe only need to count a small subset of the holomorphic cylinders and can ignore\nholomorphic planes (since they will all intersect the binding), so the computation\nis almost always far easier. Since one can read off computations from [CH08a], we\nwill content ourselves to go through a particular example in some detail to illustrate\nthe approach concretely.\nRecall that the Nielsen fixed point classes of h are the equivalence classes of\nfixed points under the equivalence relation \u223c, where x \u223c y if there is a path \u03b3\nfrom x to y such that \u03b3 is homotopic to h(\u03b3) rel endpoints. A fixed point for\nh (or more generally a periodic point) determines a loop in the mapping torus.\nIt is a well-known fact that different Nielsen equivalence classes of fixed points\ndetermine different free homotopy classes of loops in the mapping torus. More\ngenerally, two loops in the mapping torus arising from two k-periodic orbits of h\nare freely homotopic if and only if there are points on the corresponding orbits\nwhich are hk -equivalent (in this case we will call the orbits Nielsen equivalent as\nwell). Hence, to Nielsen equivalence classes we may assign a unique homotopy class\n[a] in V \\B \u223c\n=h.e. \u03a3(S, h).\n6.4. A concrete example on the figure-eight.\n6.4.1.

We can assume\n2\n1\nthat the form \u03b2 has the form ( r2 \u2212 2\u03c0\n)d\u03b8 in D2 (\u000f).\n1\nLet z be the S coordinate of the mapping torus, so that the contact form dt + \u03b2\nin these coordinates is\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nr\n1\n\u03bb = dz +\n\u2212\nd\u03b8\n2\n2\u03c0\n6.3Note that h\u2217 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 is always closed because h\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03c9.\n\n\f52\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nTo construct the open book, this is identified with a neighborhood of the boundary\nof S 1 \u00d7 D2 (\u000f/2) with coordinates (s, \u03c6, t) \u2208 D2 (\u000f/2) \u00d7 S 1 by\ns = r,\n\n\u03c6 = z,\n\nin which the form is\n\u03bb = d\u03c6 +\n\n\u0012\n\nt = \u2212\u03b8\n\n1\ns2\n\u2212\n2\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0013\n\ndt\n\nand the pages are \u03c6 = const.\nWe will now extend this form to the interior of D2 (\u000f/2) \u00d7 S 1 using a well-known\nargument [TW75]. The contact form will be\nf (s2 )d\u03c6 + g(s2 )dt \u21d2 X\u03bb =\n\nf 0 (s2 )g(s2 )\n\n\u0001\n1\nf 0 (s2 )\u2202t \u2212 g 0 (s2 )\u2202\u03c6\n2\n0\n2\n\u2212 f (s )g (s )\n\nwhere the functions f, g have the following properties (and T > 0 is a parameter):\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n1\nf (s2 ) = 1 and g(s2 ) = 2\u03c0\n\u2212 s2 /2 for s \u2265 \u000f/2\n2\n2\n2\nf (s ) = s and g(s ) = 1\u2212T s2 for s \u2264 \u03b4 for some \u03b4 > 0 as small as required\nf 0 g \u2212 f g0 > 0\ng 0 < 0: This ensures that the Reeb vector field is everywhere positively\ntransverse to the pages \u03c6 = const and is the reason we need to assume\nT > 0. Moreover, then there is some constant c = c\u000f,T \u2265 0 such that\n\u2212g 0 (s) \u2265 c > 0. This bounds the first return time of the Reeb flow to a\npage \u03c6 = const near the binding B by the constant 2\u03c0/c.\n\nThe explicit construction of such functions is straightforward but slightly tedious,\nso we will omit it. We remark as in [TW75] that it is equivalent to drawing a smooth\n1\ncurve in R2 to the point (1, 2\u03c0\n) from the point (0, 1) with respective velocities at\nthese points (1, \u2212T ), and (0, \u22121), such that the position vector is never collinear\nwith the velocity vector (and, by the fourth condition, the velocity vector must\npoint downward at all times as well).\nWe see that the binding has Conley-Zehnder index equal to\nCZ(B k ) = 2bkT c + 1\nwith respect to the framing given by the angular coordinate \u03c6 (i.e. with respect to\nthe vectors \u2202r ((r, 0), t), \u2202r ((r, \u03c0/2), t) at the point (0, 0, t) \u2208 B). Therefore we will\nselect T irrational so that B is elliptic non-degenerate. As constructed, it has an\nopen neighborhood such that no periodic orbit enters the neighborhood. The Reeb\nflow thus constructed is degenerate, but after a small perturbation can be made\nnon-degenerate without altering the dynamics too much.\nThe pages form a surface of section with bounded return time. Moreover, there\nis a page S \u223c\n= T 2 \\0 such that the restriction to a subsurface S 0 \u223c\n= T 2 \\D2 (\u000f/2) of\nthe first return map is the map h\u0303\u000f , and to a further subsurface S\u000f \u223c\n= T 2 \\D2 (\u000f) we\nhave h\u0303\u000f |S\u000f = h|S\u000f .\nGiven \u000f > 0 sufficiently small to perform the above construction, let \u03bb\u000f be such\na contact form.\nLemma 6.10. For each k \u2265 1, there is a \u000fk such that if \u000f < \u000fk then for each\nnon-trivial Nielsen fixed point class there is a unique non-degenerate closed Reeb\norbit for \u03bb\u000f in the corresponding homotopy class [a] in S 3 \\B \u223c\n= \u03a3(T 2 \\0, h).\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n53\n\nProof. The fixed point set of hk for each k is a finite set of points. Therefore, there\nis a disc D containing the puncture 0 which contains no fixed points of hl for l \u2264 k.\nChoose an even smaller disc 0 \u2208 D0 such that\n!\nk\n[\nl\n2\nh (T \\D) \u2229 D0 = \u2205\nl=1\n\nThen if D2 (\u000f) \u2282 D0 then the periodic points of period at most k of h\u0303\u000f and h on\nT 2 \\D are the same.\nWe may also choose 0 \u2208 D00 \u2282 D0 such that hl (D00 ) \u2282 D0 for 1 \u2264 l \u2264 k. Select\n\u000fk so that D2 (\u000fk ) \u2282 D00 . Then, if \u000f < \u000fk , all l-periodic orbits of h\u0303\u000f contained in\nD must enter D00 , and are therefore in fact contained in D0 . So we only have to\nexamine the cases x\u0303 \u2208 D0 and \u1ef9 \u2208 T 2 \\D.\nLet h\u000f : R2 \u2192 R2 lift h\u0303\u000f in the sense that \u03c0 \u25e6 h\u000f = \u03c0 \u25e6 h \u0303\u000f (for \u03c0 : R2 \u2192 T 2 the\nuniversal cover), which is uniquely determined by demanding h\u000f (0) = 0. Let x\u0303 be\na l-periodic point in D0 and \u1ef9 a l-periodic point in T 2 \\D, and \u03b3\u0303 a path between\nthese two points, with lifts x, y, \u03b3 respectively such that \u03b3(0) = x, \u03b3(1) = y and x is\ncontained in the preimage of D0 containing the origin in R2 . It is easy to see that\nthe orbit hi\u000f (x) remains in this component for all i and therefore hk\u000f (x) = x. On\nthe other hand, hl\u000f (y) = hl (y) 6= y. After these observations it is straightforward\nto deduce that x\u0303, \u1ef9 are not Nielsen equivalent for h\u0303l\u000f : a homotopy rel endpoints\nbetween \u03b3\u0303 and h \u0303l\u000f \u25e6 \u03b3\u0303 would lift to one between \u03b3 and hl\u000f \u25e6 \u03b3 rel endpoints, but the\nendpoints of these two paths do not even coincide so there can be no such homotopy\nin the first place. Thus, \u1ef9, x\u0303 lie in different equivalence classes.\nOne can show that the loops corresponding to l-periodic points x and y are\nhomotopic in the mapping torus if and only if there are iterates h\u0303i\u000f (x), h\u0303j\u000f (y) which\nare h\u0303l\u000f -equivalent. Since x is the only h\u0303l\u000f fixed point in its h\u0303l\u000f -equivalence class\n(which follows by checking directly that the fixed points of the matrix map hl\nlie in different equivalence classes) this shows that the corresponding orbit is the\nunique closed Reeb orbit in this homotopy class. It will be hyperbolic and therefore\nnon-degenerate.\n\u0003\nTherefore, if [a] is the homotopy class of a fixed point of h, the triple (\u03bb, B, [a])\nsatisfies (P LC) (and (\u03bb, B) satisfies (E) as well), though \u03bb may not be nondegenerate. Therefore we will need to perturb, and the following Lemma asserts\nthat small non-degenerate perturbations retain important properties:\nLemma 6.11. (Approximation lemma) In any C \u221e neighborhood of \u03bb\u000f , there is a\nnon-degenerate contact form \u03bb0\u000f with the following properties:\n\u2022 Let \u03c6t denote the Reeb flow. There are constants c, C and a page S of the\nopen book decomposition such that for any x \u2208 S, there is a least 0 < t\nsuch that \u03c6t (x) \u2208 S and c < t < C. In particular, every closed orbit has\nnon-trivial linking number with B.\n\u2022 For each Nielsen fixed point class [a] such that `([a], B) \u2264 k, if \u000f < \u000fk then\nthere is a unique non-degenerate closed Reeb orbit for \u03bb0\u000f in [a].\nProof. By Lemma 6.10 the (degenerate) contact form \u03bb\u000f has the following properties:\n\n\f54\n\nAL MOMIN\n\n\u2022 Let \u03c6t denote the Reeb flow. There are constants c, C and a page S of the\nopen book decomposition such that for any x \u2208 S, there is a first t > 0\nsuch that \u03c6t (x) \u2208 S and c0 < t < C 0 .\n\u2022 For each Nielsen fixed point class [a] such that `([a], B) \u2264 k, if \u000f < \u000fk then\nthere is a unique non-degenerate closed Reeb orbit for \u03bb0\u000f in [a].\nBy Lemma 5.2, in any C \u221e -neighborhood of \u03bb\u000f , we can find a non-degenerate contact\nform \u03bb0\u000f such that (\u03bb0\u000f , B) \u2261 (\u03bb\u000f , B). In particular, if \u03bb0\u000f is chosen close enough, the\npage S will still be a surface of section for \u03bb0\u000f because of the Conley-Zehnder index\nin a neighborhood of the binding, and because \u03bb\u000f has bounded return time on\nthe (compact) complement of this neighborhood in S if \u03bb0\u000f is chosen close enough.\nTherefore there are c, C such that if x \u2208 S then for some c < t < C (in fact, the\nfirst such t > 0) we have \u03c6t (x) \u2208 S.\nThe second assertion can be deduced from the \u03bb0\u000f non-degeneracy of the orbits\nwhich correspond to fixed points of the unperturbed map h.\n\u0003\nThe following proposition follows immediately:\nProposition 6.12. Let [a] denote a homotopy class in S 3 \\B corresponding to a\nsimple Nielsen fixed point class. Then there is an \u000f such that for the contact form\n\u03bb0\u000f in Lemma 6.11 we have (\u03bb0\u000f , B, [a]) is non-degenerate, satisfies (P LC) and for\nJ 0 \u2208 Jgen\n[a]\nCCH\u2217 (\u03bb0\u000f , J 0 rel B) \u223c\n=Q\n[a]\n\nIt follows that (see the following Remark 6.13) CCH\u2217 is defined and\n[a]\n\nCCH\u2217 (\u03be rel B) \u223c\n=Q\nRemark 6.13. While the closed orbit above is assumed simple, it is conceivable that\nthe homotopy class [a] it is in is not (i.e. contain multiply covered loops). However,\n[a]\nRemark 4.5 explains why CCH\u2217 ([\u03bb] rel B) is still well-defined. Thus the chain\nmaps/homotopies with the representative \u03bb0\u000f make sense if \u000f is sufficiently small\n[a]\nand computes CCH\u2217 (\u03bc, J rel B) for (\u03bc, B) \u223c (\u03bb0\u000f , B).\nLet us denote by \u03beo the (over-twisted) contact structure supported by this open\nbook. One may apply Theorem 1.5 to deduce, given any contact form for \u03beo with\na closed Reeb orbit transversely isotopic to B, information about the homotopy\nclasses of Reeb orbits in S 3 \\B. However, arguing a little more carefully we can\nalso deduce the following growth rate of periodic orbits in the action (which proves\nCorollary 1.11):\nProposition 6.14. Suppose \u03bc is a contact form for \u03beo , and its Reeb vector field\nhas a closed periodic orbit transversely isotopic to the binding B. Then\n\u2022 the number of geometrically distinct closed Reeb orbits of period at most N\ngrows at least exponentially in N , and\n\u2022 the number of closed orbits x such that `(x, B) \u2264 k grows exponentially in\nk.\nProof. Choose any \u03bb0 = \u03bb0\u000f as in Lemma 6.11, so that (\u03bb0 , B, [a]) satisfies (P LC)\nfor each homotopy class [a] corresponding to a non-trivial Nielsen fixed point class\nfor h. Lemma 6.11 asserts that there is a surface of section S such that each point\nx \u2208 S has first return time t in bounded by t < C for a constant C independent of\nx. In particular, for each closed Reeb orbit we have a bound T (x) < C *`(x, B). The\n\n\fCONTACT HOMOLOGY OF ORBIT COMPLEMENTS AND IMPLIED EXISTENCE\n\n55\n\nnumber of simple non-trivial Nielsen fixed point classes of hk is bounded below by\nAebk for positive constants A, b. These fixed point classes satisfy 1 \u2264 `([a], B) \u2264 k\nand therefore T < C * k. Therefore, the number of closed Reeb orbits of action at\nmost Ck is at least Aebk . By scaling b = b/C we have the number of closed Reeb\norbits of action at most k is at least Aebk .\nLet \u03bc be a contact form on S 3 with kernel \u03beo with an orbit transversely isotopic\nto B, and if necessary pull-back by a contact isotopy to arrange that this orbit\nin fact coincides with B. First suppose that \u03bc \u227a \u03bb0 . Arguing as in the proof\nof Theorem 1.5, for each non-trivial simple Nielsen fixed point class [a] such that\n`([a], B) \u2264 k we obtain a \u03bc orbit in the same homotopy class with period bounded\nby its \u03bb0 period which is itself bounded by C * k. Therefore we have an exponential\nlower bound on the number of geometrically distinct periodic orbits of period at\nleast N for \u03bc as well. Any \u03bc can be rescaled so that d\u03bc \u227a \u03bb0 , and one establishes\nlower bounds similarly (replacing b with d * b).\n\u0003\n6.5. Fibered hyperbolic knots. The arguments in the above example can be\nreplaced by any open book with one boundary component and pseudo-Anosov\nmonodromy map which is Reeb-realizable. In most examples one must smooth\nthe prong singularities of the pseudo-Anosov map, a procedure we will not discuss\n(one way to smooth the singularity is discussed in [CC09], section 3.2). Because\n\u03c6\u2217 \u2212 I is invertible (as we observed in the introduction), we can apply Lemma 6.9\ncited above to realize the (smoothed) pseudo-Anosov map by a Reeb vector field,\ncontinuing the contact form over the binding as in the last section. The reader\nshould note that the argument that the number of non-trivial Nielsen fixed point\nclasses grows exponentially is generally more complicated. Moreover, there may be\nseveral non-degenerate fixed points in certain Nielsen equivalence classes, but an\nappeal to Euler characteristics can be used if needed to show that the homology is\nnon-trivial in non-trivial classes. For details we refer to [CH08a], Section 11.1.\nConsider now specifically a tight fibered hyperbolic knot realizing the Thurston\nBennequin bound in the tight S 3 . By [Hed08], tight fibered knots realizing the\nThurston-Bennequin bound are determined by the topological knot type up to\ntransverse isotopy, so we may assume without loss of generality that such a knot\nis in fact the binding of an open book decomposition supporting the tight S 3 with\n(pseudo-Anosov) monodromy map \u03c6. By definition, the open book supports the\ntight contact structure, so the kernel of the constructed contact form (which supports this open book) is the tight contact structure on S 3 (up to isotopy). Thus\nCorollary 1.9 is proved in a similar manner as Corollary 1.11/Proposition 6.14 by\nconsidering the pseudo-Anosov monodromy map \u03c6 in place of the matrix map h.\nWe include some general remarks about tight fibered hyperbolic knots. First,\nthere are approaches to decide whether or not a given knot is fibered ([Gab86],\n[Ni07]). Second, a knot forms the binding of an open book decomposition for the\ntight S 3 if and only if it has a transverse representative which realizes the ThurstonBennequin bound (2g \u22121 where g is the three-genus) in the tight S 3 [Hed08]. Third,\na sufficient (and necessary) condition for the monodromy map to be pseudo-Anosov\nis that the knot is a hyperbolic knot [Thu98]. Finally, to see that the first property\nin the definition implies the fourth property as we claimed in the introduction,\nevaluating the Alexander polynomial \u2206(t) = det(t * I \u2212 h\u2217 ) at t = 1 shows that\nh\u2217 \u2212 I is invertible since \u2206(1) = \u00b11 for any knot.\n\n\f56\n\nAL MOMIN\n\nMatt Hedden pointed out to the author that there is an abundance of knots\nsatisfying all these properties including, for example, the Fintushel-Stern knot (see\nFigure 6.2, 12n0242 ), also known as the Pretzel knot (\u22122, 3, 7). An easy way to see\nthat there are infinitely many examples is to notice that one can positively stabilize\nmany times to make the genus g of the page arbitrarily large, thus increasing the\nself-linking number of the binding (it will be 2g \u2212 1) which distinguishes the knots.\nPositive stabilization does not change the manifold or contact structure, so 1, 2\ncontinue to hold. It is shown in e.g. [CH08b] that if one positively stabilizes an open\nbook appropriately enough times that the monodromy can be made pseudo-Anosov\n(thus will satisfy 3), so this infinite family will possess infinitely many tight fibered\nhyperbolic representatives. Using the search form in [CL] and the observations\nabove, the 35 tight fibered hyperbolic knots with crossing number at most 12 were\nfound and are listed in Figure 6.2 (by knot diagram and Alexander-Briggs notation)\n\nReferences\n[Ang05]\n\nSigurd B.
