NGC 4441 is a candidate for a merger between a spiral and an elliptical galaxy (S+E merger), because it shows typical tidal\nstructures such as an optical tail and two shells. With a far-infrared luminosity of \u223c 5 * 109 L\u2299 this galaxy belongs to the class of\nmoderate luminosity mergers, in which the merging process induces (if at all) only a moderate starburst.\nAims. The study of the atomic gas content allows us to investigate the merger history and the impact on the star formation. In particular,\nit is not clear from simulations whether an S+E merger leads to a gas concentration in the nucleus, resulting in a starburst, or whether\nthe gas is spread out and therefore too diffuse for new star forming regions.\nMethods. We used the Westerbork Radio Synthesis Telescope to observe the properties of the H i. By using this interferometer, we\nare able to study the large-scale H i distribution and kinematics with high spatial and velocity resolution.\nResults. We found two H i tails extending out to more than 40 kpc. In a central disc, the gas shows a fairly regular rotation pattern\nindicating that the gas started to settle after the merger. The total H i mass adds up to 1.5 * 109 M\u2299 . By comparing the high resolution\nH i maps with deep optical images, differences between the stellar and gaseous tidal features are apparent, which indicates an S+E\nmerger origin.\nKey words. galaxies: interactions \u2013 galaxies: starburst \u2013 galaxies: individual: NGC 4441 \u2013 radio lines: galaxies\n\n1. Introduction\nExtreme mergers between two large disc galaxies, leading to a\nsuper\u2013starburst and to ULIRGs (Sanders & Mirabel 1996) have\nbeen at the focus of research, but those galaxies are rare. Small\nspirals and ellipticals dominate the galaxy population in many\nenvironments, but mergers between them, so-called S+E mergers, have been poorly studied so far. Models of S+E mergers are in strong disagreement concerning the prediction of enhanced star formation induced by the merger. Weil & Hernquist\n(1993) used a smoothed particle hydrodynamics approach (SPH)\nto model the gas. With this fluid description, the stellar and\ngaseous components are quickly segregated. While the stars\nform features like shells, the gas congregates in the centre of\nthe remnant galaxy, leading to a strong gas concentration and\nthus resulting in a starburst, similar to ULIRGs. Simulations by\nKojima & Noguchi (1997) however predict a dispersion of the\ngas clouds which might not lead to a starburst at all, because the\ndensity of the gas is too low to collapse and form new stars. They\nmodel the gas component as a system of inelastic cloud particles\ndissipating kinetic energy in mutual collisions. If the timescale\nfor cloud-cloud collisions is relatively long, the cloud system behaves like a collisionless system, thus like the stellar component.\nTherefore, the gas and stellar distribution are similar. While the\ncontrast of the structures is somewhat higher for the stellar component, both show shell\u2013like features, as were also found for the\nstars in the models of Weil & Hernquist (1993).\nSend offprint requests to: manthey@astron.nl\n\nSimulations by Naab & Burkert (2000), Naab & Burkert (2001),\nKhochfar & Burkert (2003) and Naab et al. (2006) revealed the\nimportance of S+E mergers for the formation of bright ellipticals. As Khochfar & Burkert (2003) claim, these aspects are,\nhowever, poorly studied so far, and detailed observational investigations are needed besides more numerical simulations to better understand the process of those mergers.\nOne 'prototypical' S+E merger candidate is NGC 4194, the\nMedusa. In the optical we see a diffuse tail going to the north and\non the opposite side 2 shells are visible, as predicted by models.\nMolecular gas is found in a continuous distribution out to 4.7 kpc\nfrom the centre, i.e much more spread out than in the case\nof a ULIRG (Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister 2000; Aalto et al. 2001).\nHowever, this galaxy is clearly undergoing an intense starburst\nphase, albeit not as strong as in ULIRGs (Weistrop et al. 2004).\nHere we present high resolution interferometric H i data of another S+E merger candidate, NGC 4441. This galaxy is morphologically very similar to the Medusa. It possesses one optical tidal tail and two bluish shells on the opposite side, which\nare, however, brighter, i.e. more evolved, than the shells in the\nMedusa. The main body has an elliptical shape (Bergvall 1981)\nwith a small dust layer through the centre on the minor axis.\nBased on spectroscopic data Bergvall (1981) claims that this\ngalaxy is a merger where most of the gas has been already used\nfor star formation, which means only little ongoing star formation. However, there must have been a period of enhanced star\nformation, since the stellar population is younger than that of a\nnormal elliptical galaxy (Bergvall 1981).

Here we\nuse the optical image to compare the stellar and gaseous distribution. For further analysis of the optical data, we refer to\nManthey et al. (2008c).\n\n3. Data Reduction\nTable 2.

We refer to the analysis\nof optical long-slit spectra for metalicity estimations, but these\ndata are presented in detail in Manthey et al. (2008c).\nIn Table 1 general information on NGC 4441 is given. In Section\n2 we give basic information about the observations obtained, in\nSection 3 we describe the data reduction for the interferometric\ndata. Results are presented in Section 4, including derived properties like the H i gas mass and the star formation rate based on\nthe 20 cm continuum flux. In Section 5 we discuss the observations with particular emphasis on models of mergers between\nEllipticals and Spirals and we compare NGC 4441 with the S+E\nmerger prototype NGC 4194 (the Medusa). Finally, in Section 6\nwe summarise the observations and results.\n\n2. Observations\n2.1. WSRT\n\nThe H i observations with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio\nTelescope (WSRT) were carried out in February 2003. Table 2\nsummarises the most important observing parameters. We observed NGC 4441 in one 12 h run in the maxi\u2013short array configuration. This is best suitable for observations of an extended\nsource within a single 12 hours track. The quality of the data\nis good, no interference problems occurred. For bandpass and\nflux calibration, the calibrator 3C48 was observed before the\nobservations. Note that no secondary phase calibrator was observed. Instead, phase calibration at the WSRT is usually done\nusing self-calibration. The chosen setup with a total bandwidth\nof 20 MHz (corresponding to \u223c4000 km s\u22121 ) and a velocity resolution of 4 km s\u22121 channel\u22121 was capable to detect both narrow\nfeatures in velocity space and a broad total velocity range due to\ntidal disruption. With the chosen setup, two polarisations were\nobserved, with 1024 channels available for each of them.\n\nThe H i data were reduced using MIRIAD1 with some additional tasks written by T. Oosterloo which are specific to the\nWesterbork interferometer2. After inspecting and, where necessary, flagging the calibrators, the WSRT data have to be calibrated first for changes in the system temperature. Since no secondary calibrator was observed, after flux and bandpass calibration a continuum image was created to perform self-calibration\non continuum sources within the field. To achieve a proper calibration, it is necessary to deeply CLEAN the continuum image. In an iterative process, first a mask was created which\nincluded only real emission to define the CLEANing components. Second, the image was CLEANed using the mask and\nsubsequently a new, deeper mask could be generated for a better CLEANing. Once the image was finally CLEANed, selfcalibration was performed, and the loop started again with creating a mask, CLEANing and self-calibration. The data quality was high enough that only 3 iterations were necessary for\na proper calibration. The results were then applied to the target galaxy. After continuum subtraction, a datacube was created\nto which we applied Hanning smoothing, leading to a velocity resolution of 8 km s\u22121 . The datacube was convolved with a\nGaussian of roughly double the size of the original beam. With\nthis smoothed image a mask was created including real emission only. This was checked for all channels using the KARMA\nmovie option (Gooch 1996). This mask was used for CLEANing\nas described above for the self-calibration process of the continuum. This CLEANing procedure was repeated 3 times until no\nsignificant sidelobes were visible. Integrated intensity and velocity maps were created using the MOMENT task in MIRIAD.\nFinally, primary beam correction was applied to the integrated\nintensity maps. We created maps which were naturally weighted,\nthus providing the highest sensitivity, as well as maps with a robust weighting of 0.5 to reach a higher spatial resolution. We\nreached an rms of 0.4 mJy beam\u22121 in the naturally weighted\nmap and and rms of 0.5 mJy beam\u22121 in the robustly weighted\nmap. Here we present only the robust map with the higher spatial resolution, because the naturally weighted maps, although\nmore sensitive, do not show any additional significant flux contribution compared to the robust map.\n\n4.

Both tails have a similar extent: the northern tail out to\n48 kpc, the southern tail out to 42 kpc from the nucleus and both\nform a relatively symmetric structure. The H i tails are clumpy,\nincluding the tip of both tails. Two large clumps are found, both\n\u223c 17 kpc from the centre (marked as NC and SC in Fig. 1).\nFrom the kinematics there are no indications that these clumps\nare or will be separate gravitationally bound entities like those\nsimulated by Duc & Bournaud (2007).\nIt is noticeable that the symmetry in the H i distribution is not\nseen in the optical morphology. Here, there is a tail to the north\nwhich coincides nicely in position and extension with the large\nnorthern H i clump. In the southern direction, however, we see\na misalignment of the H i tail and the optical tidal features. Two\nshells are visible in the optical southwest of the main body.\nThere is almost no overlap of the more western, outer shell with\nthe H i tail. The tip of the inner shell corresponds to the southern\nH i clump. Three optical knots are found at that position, of\nwhich at least two do not look point-like, i.e., are probably not\nforeground stars. They might be star forming knots, probably\ntoo close to the galaxy to survive as tidal dwarf galaxies, but can\nalso be background galaxies, because our deep R-band image\nshows a background galaxy cluster. However, no H i is detected\nat higher velocities within our band, which may of course miss\ndistant galaxies. Unfortunately, the distance of the background\ncluster is not known.\nThe gas in the tails shows only little dispersion in general\n(< 15 km s\u22121 ). The dispersion increases slightly in regions of\ngradients in the atomic gas distribution, e.g., around clumps.\n\nFig. 3. R-band image (taken with the CAHA 2.2 m telescope) of\nthe central region.

Even though drawing an ellipse is approximate, it is\nnot arbitrary here. Based on the elliptical shape of the velocity\nfield shown in Fig. 5 it is clear the the disc is seen relatively\nedge-on, thus the uncertainty of the inclination does not affect\nthe mass calculation significantly.\nWe measured an axis ratio of \u223c 1/3, equivalent to an inclination of \u223c 70\u25e6 . An error of \u00b120\u25e6 leads to an uncertainty of a factor\nof 2 in mass and thus gives at least an indication of the mass\nrange. Note, that the minor axis is however not perpendicular to\nthe major axis, which is a hint for non-radial motions like infall\nor outflow that could be triggered by the merger. One possible\nexplanation would be an elongated gravitational potential, e.g.,\na bar or spiral arms, which forces the gas to move on ellipsoidal\norbits. The resolution is, however, not sufficient to investigate\nthis in more detail. Furthermore, the minor axis corresponds to\nthe thin dust lane seen in the central region (see Fig. 3).\nIn Fig. 6 we present the position-velocity-diagram (pv-diagram)\nthrough the major axis of the H i disc (position angle (pa) =\n325\u25e6 ). It shows a broad velocity range which is expected for\na highly inclined disc. In the centre there is a gap because of\nthe local minimum in the H i distribution. A second velocity\ncomponent at high velocities appears in the inner part, which\ndemonstrates the complexity of the velocity distribution in this\nmerger remnant.\nWith an inclination of \u223c 70\u25e6 and a maximum H i rotation\n\nFig. 6.

The continuum source in NGC 4441 is\nbarely resolved and concentrated on the nucleus of the galaxy.\nWe fitted a Gaussian to the continuum source using the MIRIAD\ntask IMFIT and derived a deconvolved source size of less than\n1 kpc. The derived centre coordinates corresponds to the optical\ncoordinates. To estimate the star formation rate (SFR) from the\n20-cm radio continuum flux density we use\nSFR (M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 0.14 D2 F20 cm\ntaken from Condon (1992) and Haarsma et al. (2000), where D\nis the distance in Mpc and F20 cm is the 20-cm radio continuum\nflux density in Jy. In Table 5 the results for NGC 4441 are given.\nTable 5 also gives the SFR estimated from the FIR luminosity:\nSFR (M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 0.17 LFIR\nfollowing Kennicutt (1998), with LFIR in units of 109 L\u2299 . The\nIRAS 60 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm flux densities were taken from Moshir\n(1990). The SFR of 1\u20132 M\u2299 yr\u22121 calculated with both methods\nis low for a merger and normal for typical spirals.\nWe also calculated the logarithmic ratio of FIR to radio flux, the\nso-called q parameter (Helou et al. 1985):\n12\n\nq = log F(FIR)/(3.75*10\nF(1.4 GHz)\n\nHz)\n\nNote, that the continuum flux at 1.4 GHz, F(1.4 GHz)\nin this formula, is in units of W m2 Hz\u22121 =\n1026 Jy. The FIR flux, F(FIR), is a combination of the\n60 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm flux densities, as used for determining\nLFIR : F(FIR) = 1.26 * 10\u221214 * (2.58 * F(60 \u03bcm) + F(100 \u03bcm)).\nTo calculate q, F(FIR) is normalised by the mean frequency of\n60 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm, which is 3.75 * 1012 Hz. Helou et al. (1985)\nderived a mean value for q of 2.3. Although this parameter was\ndetermined for disc galaxies only (but independent of their star\nformation activity), NGC 4441 (q = 2.4) conforms to this value.\n\nFor an understanding of the whole merger process of galaxies\nresulting in a remnant like NGC 4441, it is necessary to know\nthe progenitors. Of course it is difficult, if not impossible, to get\na unique answer to that question from a completely merged remnant. However, there are some indications from our observations\nwhich at least narrow the parameter space.\nSince we found a large amount of gas in NGC 4441, at least one\nspiral galaxy must be involved in the merger process. In the following, we discuss the possibility of a spiral+spiral (S+S) and\nspiral+elliptical (S+E) merger.\nSpiral+elliptical merger?\n\nThere are several arguments that support an S+E merger origin:\nNo strongly enhanced star formation: Typically, S+S merger\nremnants which show strong tidal features comparable to what\nis seen in NGC 4441, host a region of a (fading) starburst, e.g.,\nHibbard & van Gorkom (1996). By looking at the FIR luminosity, the 20 cm continuum emission and the optical spectra\n(Manthey et al. 2005), however we do not find any indication\nfor a strong starburst, neither ongoing nor in the recent history,\nin NGC 4441. Therefore, less gas is probably involved in this\nmerger event, which is naturally the case when one progenitor\nis an elliptical.\nIt has to be mentioned, however, that the strength of an induced\nstarburst not only depends on the available amount of gas\nbut also on the internal structure of the progenitor galaxies.\nIn particular, the presence of a bulge in a progenitor spiral\ngalaxy will stabilise the gas disc against the formation of a\nbar during the merger (Mihos 1999a). That bar would be a\npowerful mechanism to support infall of gas into the central\nregion leading to a strong starburst (Mihos & Hernquist 1994).\nIn S+S merger simulations gas dissipates energy and thus\nloses angular momentum when it becomes shocked along\na bar (Barnes & Hernquist 1991, 1996; Mihos & Hernquist\n1996; Barnes 1999). This leads to rapid gas inflows and a\nconcentration of gas in the centre of the remnant, resulting in a\nstarburst.\nNevertheless, the simulations for S+S with bulges, i.e., no\nmerger-induced bars, never show such a low star formation rate\nas in the case of NGC 4441.\nOf course, it is necessary to investigate in numerical simulations\nhow bar formation and a present bulge influences the gas\nin a S+E merger scenario, in particular when the galaxies\nare completely merged. Due to the spheroidal shape of the\nelliptical which is similar to a bulge, bar formation is likely not\nimportant and therefore no strong gas inflows occur. Since the\nmajor and minor axes of NGC 4441 are not perpendicular, this\n\n\f6\n\nE. Manthey et al.: The H i content of the advanced merger NGC 4441\n\nmight indicate the presence of a small oval distortion which is,\nhowever, not strong enough to trigger enhanced star formation.\nTheoretical models: Various numerical simulations showed\nthat optical shells in combination with tidal tails are typical\nfor S+E merger remnants (Quinn 1984; Dupraz & Combes\n1986; Hernquist & Quinn 1988; Kojima & Noguchi 1997;\nCombes & Charmandaris 1999). These shells are created by\nphase wrapping of the disc in the potential well of the elliptical\ngalaxy (Quinn 1984). They occur in the advanced merger stage\n\u223c 4 \u2212 5 * 108 yr after the impact and last for more than 1 Gyr\n(Quinn 1984; Kojima & Noguchi 1997).\nThe simulated gas distribution strongly depends on the model\nused for the ISM. It has been noted by Combes & Charmandaris\n(1999) and Charmandaris & Combes (2000) that the often used\nsmoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) approach might not\nalways be appropriate. Instead, these authors account for the\nclumpy structure of the ISM by simulating the behaviour of\nindividual gas clouds rather than a continuous fluid. They found\na largely spread gas distribution, often forming gaseous tails as\nwe see in NGC 4441. Therefore, these models do not predict a\nstrong starburst phase, because the gas becomes too dispersed.\nThis agrees with our observations, but stands in contrast to\nS+S merger scenarios (e.g., Barnes & Hernquist 1991; Mihos\n1999b).\nStellar component similar as the Medusa: The similarity of\nthe optical morphologies of NGC 4441 and NGC 4194, the\nprototypical S+E merger remnant, has been mentioned in the\nintroduction, reflecting a possible analogue merger origin.\nBesides the obvious features like the stellar shells and tidal tails,\nboth galaxies host a dust lane.\nIn NGC 4441, the minor axis of the fairly regularly rotating\nH i disc corresponds to a faint central dust lane (Fig. 3). It is\ninteresting to note that also the Medusa exhibits a minor axis\ndust lane. Although this may further strengthen the notion of\na a similar origin, the dust lane of the Medusa is more prominent and longer (it curves into the optical tail). Furthermore,\nthat dust lane is associated with a double spectral feature\n(Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister 2000). Such extra features are not seen\nin NGC 4441. This may be a result of its more evolved state,\nbecause a large fraction of the ISM has been consumed in star\nformation.\nH i vs. optical morphology: In NGC 4441 we see striking differences between the stellar and gaseous distribution. In particular\nthe two optical shells stand in contrast to the two symmetric H i\ntails.\nIn S+S merger remnants, however, the optical and H i morphology are generally similar (Hibbard & van Gorkom 1996), because both the stellar and gaseous tidal features are formed from\nthe two discs which are merging. Hibbard et al. (2000) found\nsome examples in which the optical and the gaseous tails are\ndisplaced or where some regions are lacking gas, while the overall morphologies are still similar. The authors described several\nscenarios for these discrepancies between the stellar and gaseous\ntidal morphology and claim that mainly superwinds are responsible for the differences found. These superwinds are driven by\nthe central starburst occuring in S+S merger remnants and sweep\naway the gas in the direction of the wind.\nTheir findings differ, however, in two ways from NGC 4441.\nFirst, NGC 4441 does not host an ongoing strong starburst, neither did it in the recent history. Therefore, the existence of a\nsuperwind is unlikely. Second, we see not only an offset of the\n\ngaseous and stellar tidal features, but also a completely different morphology. This cannot be explained by a possible superwind alone. Other possible explanations given by Hibbard et al.\n(2000), like dust-obscuration and photoionisation, can only explain local differences and not large-scale discrepancies, as\npointed out by the authors. Photoionisation might explain why\nthere is only little gas found in the outer optical shell. In that\ncase we expect to find a large amount of ionised gas which can\nbe detected in e.g. H\u03b1 emission. This will be done in a further\ninvestigation.\nSpiral+Spiral merger?\n\nThere is one striking difference between NGC 4441 and S+E\nmerger simulations as well as the prototype NGC 4194:\nTwo symmetric H i tails: The discussion of the merger origin\nof N GC 4441 is complicated by the finding of two symmetric H i tails. This is typical for a merger between two\ndisc galaxies, when each disc forms one tail during the encounter (e.g., Toomre & Toomre 1972; Hernquist & Barnes\n1994; Mihos & Hernquist 1996). Neither the simulations\nby Weil & Hernquist (1993) nor Kojima & Noguchi (1997)\nshow the appearance of two tails in an S+E merger scenario.\nFurthermore, our H i data of the prototypical S+E merger\nNGC 4194 show only one gaseous tail in that galaxy, in accordance to the S+E merger simulations (Manthey et al. 2008b)\nObservations of the interacting S+E galaxy system Arp 140\n(an early stage of an S+E merger where both galaxies are\nstill clearly separated) done by Cullen et al. (2007) showed as\nwell one H i tail only. Furthermore, they found an H i bridge\nbetween the interacting galaxies formed by disc material\nwhich streams towards the elliptical galaxy (Toomre & Toomre\n1972). This bridge will likely be destroyed once the galaxies\nfinally merge, as in the case of bridges found in S+S mergers\n(Toomre & Toomre 1972; Hibbard 1995).\nIn recent deep observations of early-type galaxies Morganti et al.\n(2006) found a significant amount of H i in a large fraction of\nthose galaxies. The data reveal a variety of structures, including extended discs. However, the peak column density is with\nN(H i) \u2264 1020 cm\u22122 lower than what we found in NGC 4441\n(N(H i) = 1.1 * 1021 cm\u22122 ), so no star formation occurs in\nthe regular early-type galaxies of the Morganti et al. (2006)\nsample. However, considering the likely S+E merger origin of\nNGC 4441, it is possible that the elliptical progenitor possessed\nsuch a gas disc, which would explain why NGC 4441 has two\nH i tidal tails and otherwise resembles an S+E merger remnant.\nThe low column density H i disc around ellipticals might also\nexplain why the star formation in NGC 4441 is not as enhanced\nby the merger as in 'normal' disc\u2013disc mergers.\n5.2. The formation of the central H i disc\n\nClearly, NGC 4441 is in an advanced merger stage, because\neven the progenitor nuclei are completely merged in addition to\nthe pronounced stellar tidal features. In this stage a stable gas\ndisc can already have formed, as shown by Barnes (2002). In\nunequal-mass mergers the disc formation is more impressive\n(Barnes 2001), which again supports that NGC 4441 is at least\nnot an advanced remnant of a merger between two large disc\ngalaxies.\nThe fairly regular rotation pattern in the central HI disc indicates\n\n\fE. Manthey et al.: The H i content of the advanced merger NGC 4441\n\nthat the merger event has happened several hundred million\nyears ago (e.g., Mihos 1999a). The gas in this advanced merger\nhas already started to settle down, but without reaching an\nequilibrium state yet. The lack of H i in the centre (Figs. 1, 6)\nmight be caused by an efficient transformation of atomic to\nmolecular gas. This is supported by our CO detection within the\ncentral 22\u2032\u2032 (Manthey et al. 2008a).\nThe velocity gradient of the central disc connects to that of the\ntwo tidal tails, even though perturbations are clearly present.\nThat means that the material in the tails and the central disc\nshare the same sense of rotation. This indicates that a large\namount of angular momentum still remains in the gas of the\ntidal tails. A merger geometry in which the angular momentum\ndoes not cancel out much seems therefore likely, e.g., a prograde\nmerger with parallel rotation spins of the galaxies. Independent\nof the presence of an H i disc in the elliptical progenitor, a\nprograde merger is likely in which the rotation of the spiral and\nthe movement of the spiral towards the elliptical are aligned.\nThe amount of conserved angular momentum in the gas also\ndepends on other factors, e.g., the presence of a bar formed\nduring the interaction in which the gas loses angular momentum\nby shocks (see above).\nIf no strong shocks occur, the gas retains much of its angular\nmomentum, which prevents the gas from falling toward the\ncentral region on short timescales. Instead, a gaseous disc will\nbe formed. The remaining gas in the tidal tails will finally\nreturn to the main body and will lead to the growth of the\npresent H i disc. This behaviour is modelled by e.g., Barnes\n(2002) and is observed in other merger remnants like NGC 7252\n(Hibbard et al. 1994; Hibbard & Mihos 1995) and NGC 4038/39\n(Hibbard et al. 2001).\n\n5.3. The star forming region\n\nNGC 4441 has a moderate ongoing star formation rate of\n1 \u2212 2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . However, there are indications based on optical\nspectroscopy that there has been a period of enhanced star\nformation \u223c 1 Gyr ago (Bergvall 1981; Manthey et al. 2005).\nThe extent of the star-forming region can be investigated\nusing the continuum data. The deconvolved size of the 20 cm\ncontinuum source was determined as <1 kpc (Table 5). The\nemission comes likely from ongoing star formation only, since\nthe q value agrees with the FIR-to-20 cm continuum ratio\ntypical for star formation, and based on optical spectroscopy\nthere are no hints for another origin, e.g. an AGN (Bergvall\n1981). Manthey et al. (2008a) found molecular gas extended\nout to \u223c4 kpc in NGC 4441. Thus, the region of ongoing star\nformation is embedded in the reservoir of raw material for\nstar formation, namely the molecular gas extent, but does not\ncover its full extent. Compared to the Medusa, where the region\nof ongoing star formation is extended on a scale of \u223c 2 kpc\n(e.g., Armus et al. 1990) and much more intense (S FRopt \u223c\n30 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ), the star forming activity seems to be shrunk in\nintensity and maybe also in spatial extent. The question arises,\nwhy the starburst in NGC 4441 has already faded, while the\nMedusa is still intensely forming stars. Aalto & H\u00fcttemeister\n(2000) estimate that the burst in the Medusa will continue only\nfor \u223c 40 * 106 years, under the assumption that the current\nstar formation rate will not change dramatically. If the star\nformation rate depends mainly on the duration of the burst\nand decreases with ongoing burst age, the phase of intense star\nformation in a merger event, which NGC 4441 and the Medusa\n\n7\n\nboth underwent, might be very short, and the Medusa will fade\nsoon as well.\nFurthermore, it has become clear by simulations of S+S mergers that the starburst intensity in mergers of unequal masses\nstrongly depends on the structure of the progenitors (e.g., the\npresence of a bulge) and the geometry of the merger event\n(orbits, spin orientation of the galaxies etc.) (Cox et al. 2007).\nEven though no detailed simulations exist to investigate this\nphenomenon in the case of S+E mergers, it is likely that these\nfactors play a similar important role in S+E mergers. Therefore,\n(unequal-mass) S+E mergers are expected to show a much\nlarger scatter in starburst strength even if they are in the same\nmerger stage.\n\n6. Summary\n1. We observed the moderate luminosity merger NGC 4441\nwith the Westerbork radio interferometer and found a complex, extended H i structure affected by tidal forces. The total\nH i mass adds up to 1.46 * 109 M\u2299 .\n2. We detected two H i tails. Both tails have a similar extent\nout to 4\u2032 (42 kpc, southern tail) and 4.6\u2032 (48 kpc, northern tail)\naway from the centre and they emerge from opposite sides\nof the main galactic body.\n3. The northern H i arm follows the optical tail closely, however\nthe H i is more extended and shifted to the east. In contrast,\nthe southern H i arm is not aligned with the shell structure\nfound in the optical, but touches only the inner optical shell,\nwhereas in the outer shell no neutral gas is found.\n4. The velocity field shows a fairly regular rotation pattern in\nthe inner region, associated with the optical main body. The\noverall velocity gradient is continued in the tidal tails. The\nsouthern tail has a generally lower velocity as the system, the\nvelocity of the northern tail is larger than the central velocity.\n5. From the 20 cm continuum flux we calculated the star formation rate as 2.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . From the FIR fluxes we get a\nSFR of 1.0 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The resulting ratio q is 2.4, which is in\ngood agreement with the typical q value in the literature. We\ndetermined a continuum source size of less than 1 kpc.\n6. Because of the large differences in the stellar and gaseous\ndistribution, it is unlikely that NGC 4441 is a merger between two large disc galaxies. If differences are found in\nthose mergers, they are on much smaller scales and can be\nbest explained by superwinds (see Hibbard et al. 2000). In\nNGC 4441, no such strong galactic winds are expected, because the galaxy is in a phase of moderate star formation. A\nmerger between two ellipticals can be also excluded, because\nwe found a large amount of atomic and molecular gas and\nsigns of a past strong star formation activity. This properties\nare not expected in E+E mergers. Thus, it is most likely, that\nNGC 4441 is the remnant of an S+E merger.\nAcknowledgements.
