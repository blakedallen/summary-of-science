At temperature above the transition\ntemperature Tc to the superconducting state, when the\nsystem is still metallic, pairs of electrons are formed for\na limited time. These superconduting fluctuations affect\nboth transport and thermodynamic properties.\nIn bulk superconductors Tc can be reduced or even\ncompletely suppressed by various phase-breaking mechanisms, for example by applying a magnetic field or introducing magnetic impurities. A special situation occurs\nfor superconducting rings and cylinders threaded by a\nmagnetic flux \u03c6. Tc is periodically reduced as a function\nof \u03c6, a phenomenon known as Little-Parks oscillations [2].\nThe period of the oscillations is equal to 1 as a function\nof the reduced flux \u03c6 = \u03c6/\u03c60 , where the superconducting\nflux quantum is \u03c60 = 2\u03c0~c/2e = \u03c0/e [3], see Fig. 1.\nThe magnitude of the maximal reduction in Tc is sizedependent. As we see in Fig. 1, mean field (MF) theory\npredicts that for small rings or cylinders with r \u2261 R/\u03be <\n0.6 the transition temperature is equal to zero in a finite\ninterval close to half-integer flux, giving rise to a fluxtuned quantum phase transition, see also Eq. (8) below.\nIn this Letter we show that the pair fluctuations give a\nlarge contribution to the persistent current (PC) I even\nat fluxes for which Tc is reduced to zero and the system\nhas a finite resistance.\nRecent experiments added significantly to our understanding of fluctuation phenomena in superconductors\nwith doubly-connected geometry. Strong Little-Parks oscillations in the region where \u03be > R, where Tc is reduced to zero, have been observed in a transport measurement on superconducting cylinders [4]. Koshnick et\nal. [5] measured the PC in small superconducting rings\nin the regime where R > \u03be, for the smallest rings under\nstudy Tc was reduced by \u2248 6%. In this Letter we discuss\nthe PC both in the regime of moderate Tc suppression for\nr = R/\u03be & 1 as well as the strong Little-Parks oscillations\nfor r < 0.6. Before presenting details of our approach,\nwe summarize the main results of our analysis.\n\nT\nTc\n\n1\n0.8\n\nr= 21\nr=1\n\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n\u03c6c\n0,25\n\n1\u2212\u03c6c\n0,5\n\n0,75\n\n1\n\n1,25\n\n1,5\n\n1,75\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\n\nFIG. 1: Mean field (MF) phase diagram. Tc\u03c6 separates the\nmetallic (high T ) and the superconducting (low T ) phase\nas a function of the flux \u03c6 = \u03c6/\u03c60 through the ring. For\nsufficiently small rings with effective radius r = R/\u03be < 0.6\nMF theory predicts a full reduction of Tc for fluxes between\n\u03c6c \u2248 0.83r and 1 \u2212 \u03c6c near \u03c6 = 1/2. The transition line\nreflects the condition L\u22121\n00 = 0, cf Eq. (8).\n\nI. Regime with r = R/\u03be < 0.6: For r < 0.6 the mean\nfield Tc vanishes and one would naively expect a small\nnormal state PC. We find, however, that close to the critical mean field line (see Fig. 1) there is a parametrically\nlarge enhancement of the PC due to quantum fluctuations that decays only slowly away from that line. The\nmagnitude for the normal PC is IN \u223c \u03c610 RD2 log1 g , where\ng is the dimensionless ring conductance [6, 7]. Our calculations show that the PC due to pair fluctuations near\nthe critical flux \u03c6c is parametrically larger and at low T\ngiven by\n\u0013\n\u0012\nTc 1 \u03be\n1\nIFL \u2248 \u2212\n,\n(1)\nlog\n\u03c60 \u03c6c R\n\u2206\u03c6\nwhere \u2206\u03c6 \u2261 (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6c )/\u03c6c measures the distance to the\ncritical flux \u03c6c . When increasing T the PC initially grows\nbefore going through a maximum at finite T , where it\ncan considerably exceed the result of Eq. (1) [see Fig. 3].\nSince r\u22121 = \u03be/R is a number of order 1 and RD2 = \u03c08 Tr2c\nfor a weakly disordered superconductor, we find an enhancement factor of log(g) log(1/\u2206\u03c6).\nOur results are obtained for the case when the flux\n\n\f2\nacts as a pair breaking mechanism. Other pair breaking mechanisms, e.g. magnetic impurities or a magnetic\nfield penetrating the ring itself will lead to similar results. They cause a reduction of Tc to zero, the pair\nfluctuations, however, lead to a parametric enhancement\nof the PC in the normal state. Ref. [8] suggests that a\nsimilar mechanism due to magnetic impurities is related\nto the unexpectedly large PC in noble metal rings [9, 10].\nA metallic state with small but finite resistance was\nobserved experimentally in superconducting cylinders [4,\n11] with \u03c6 \u2248 1/2. Further theoretical and experimental\nstudies will be needed in order to clarify the relation to\nour findings, where a large PC is caused by pair fluctuations that are unable to condense.\nII. Regime with r > 1: The case r > 1 is suitable\nfor the description of the experiments on persistent currents by Koshnick et al. [5]. Previously the experiment\nhas been interpreted using a one-dimensional GinzburgLandau theory to describe the order parameter fluctuations [12]. Following these lines one has to resort to\nnumerical methods [13] in order to describe the critical\nregion close to Tc , where fluctuations proliferate.\nOur key observation is that part of the rings in the\nexperiment allow for a description using a suitable generalization [14] of the 0d Ginzburg-Landau theory. Indeed, following an expansion of the order parameter field\n\u03c8(\u03b8) in terms of angular momentum modes \u03c8n , a simple\n\u221a\nphysical picture arises in the limit g \u226b r. Two of the\nmodes compete with each other close to half-integer flux,\nwhile at the same time both of them strongly fluctuate\nin the critical regime close to Tc .\nFormally, the competition arises due to the quartic\nterm in the GL functional that induces an interaction\nbetween the modes [15] and reveals itself in the experiment mostly in the \"slope\" of the PC, the susceptibility\n\u2202I\n\u03c7 = \u2212 \u2202\u03c6\n. With this insight \u03c7 can be calculated analytically even in the critical fluctuation regime.\nAs an example, denoting the susceptibility at Tc and\nzero flux by \u03c70 and at Tc,\u03c6=1/2 by \u03c71/2 , we find\n\u221a\n\u03c71/2 /\u03c70 \u2248 \u22122.7 g/r.\n\n(2)\n\nExperimentally, a strong enhancement of the magnetic\nsusceptibility near \u03c6 = 1/2 compared to \u03c6 \u2248 0 was observed and Eq. (2) demonstrates that it is controlled by\n\u221a\nthe parameter g/r. If it is large, the current will rapidly\nchange sign as a function of the flux at half-integer flux,\nleading to a saw-tooth like shape of i\u03c6 . The full T dependence of \u03c7\u03c6=1/2 is given in Eq. (7). For the smallest\n\u221a\nrings in Ref. 5, 16, g \u2248 33r.\nClassical GL functional - After presenting the main\nresults in Eqs. (1) and (2) we now give more details of\nour approach starting with the description of rings with\nonly a moderate suppression of Tc (i.e. r & 1).\nWhen the superconducting coherence length \u03be(T ) and\nthe magnetic penetration depth \u03bb(T ) are much larger\n\nthan the ring thickness, the system is well described by\na one-dimensional order parameter field \u03c8 [17]. The\npartition function can be written as a weighted averageR over configurations of the order parameter \u03c8,\nZ = D\u03c8 exp[\u2212F /TP\n]. Introducing angular momentum\nin\u03b8\n, where V is the volume\nmodes as \u03c8(\u03b8) = \u221a1V\nn \u03c8n e\nof the ring, the free energy functional takes the form\nF=\n\nX\nn\n\nan\u03c6 |\u03c8n |2 +\n\nb X\n\u2217\n\u03b4n+k,l+m \u03c8n \u03c8m\n\u03c8k \u03c8l\u2217 . (3)\n2V\nnmkl\n\nHere we wrote an\u03c6 = \u03b1Tc \u03b5n\u03c6 , where \u03b5n\u03c6 = [T \u2212 Tn\u03c6 /Tc\nis the reduced temperature and Tn\u03c6 = Tc [1\u2212(n\u2212\u03c6)2 /r2 ]\nis determined by the sign change of the coefficient an (\u03c6)\nand can thus loosely be interpreted as the transition temperature of mode \u03c8n [18]. The mean field transition occurs at Tc\u03c6 that is equal to the maximal Tn for given\n\u03c6, i.e. at the point where the first mode becomes superconducting when lowering the temperature (cf. Fig.\n1). The 0d Ginzburg parameter Gi = (2b/\u03b12 Tc V )1/2 is\nan estimate for the width of the critical regime in the\n\u221a\nvariable \u03b5n . The parameter g/r \u2248 1/5r2 Gi has been\nused when stating our results. Its relevance is now easily\nunderstood. 1/r2 is a measure for the typical spacing between the transition temperatures Tn for different modes,\nsince (T0 \u2212 T1 )/Tc = (1 \u2212 2\u03c6)/r2 . This spacing should\nbe compared to the typical width of the non-Gaussian\nfluctuation region, Gi. If it is large, a theory including\nonly one or two angular momentum modes is applicable.\nPersistent current - The persistent current I is found\nfrom the free energy F = \u2212T ln Z by differentiation I =\n\u2212\u2202F/\u2202\u03c6. The normalized current is given by\ni = I/(Tc /\u03c60 ) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n2\u03b1\n(n \u2212 \u03c6) |\u03c8n |2 .\n2\nr\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\n(4)\n\nThe averaging is performed with respect to the functional\nF in Eq. (3). i\u03c6 is periodic in the flux \u03c6 with period one.\nSince it is also an odd function of the flux, it vanishes\nwhen the flux takes integer or half-integer values.\nCase \u03c6 \u2248 0 : The most important contribution in\nthe regime of non-Gaussian fluctuations close to integer fluxes comes from the angular momentum mode\n\u03c8n with the highest transition temperature Tn\u03c6 . One\nmay then approximate Eq. (3) by a single-mode and\nb\n|\u03c8n |4 [19]. This is\ncalculate with Fn = an |\u03c8n |2 + 2V\nthe 0d limit of the GL functional [20] where the functional integral becomes a conventional integral. Indeed,\nperforming\nthe integral in polar coordinates, one finds\n\u221a\nZ = \u03c0\u03b1Gi\u03c0 exp(x2n ) erfc(xn ), where xn = \u03b5n /Gi [21]. Using now Eq. (4) with one mode only we find\nin = 4\u039b(n \u2212 \u03c6)f (xn ) for \u03c6 \u2248 n.\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nexp(\u2212x2 )\n\u2212x\nHere \u039b \u2261 1/r2 Gi \u2248 5 g/r and f (x) = \u221a\n\u03c0erfc(x)\n[21]. We note in passing the high degree of universality\n\n\f3\nimplied by this result: All PC measurements will fall on\nthe same curve, if the PC \u2013 measured in suitable units\ni = I/(Tc /\u03c60 ) \u2013 and the reduced temperature \u03b5\u03c6 = (T \u2212\n\u221a\nTc\u03c6 )/Tc are scaled as i \u2192 i \u221arg , \u01eb\u03c6 \u2192 \u01eb\u03c6 r g. The scaling\nfunction f was given above. This relation is a valuable\nguide in characterizing different rings in experiments.\nFar above Tc one obtains as a limiting case the Gaussian result for a single mode in \u2248 2(n\u2212\u03c6)/r2 \u03b5n\u03c6 , that can\nalso be obtained directly by neglecting the quartic term\nin the GL functional. It is known, however, that as soon\nas temperatures are too high, \u03b5n \u226b 1/r2 , it is important\nto sum the contribution of all modes [22]. Far below Tc\none recovers the mean field result iMF \u2261 r2\u22124\nGi2 \u03b5n\u03c6 (n\u2212\u03c6)\nfor the PC in the superconducting regime. An alternative route to finding the mean field result would be to\nminimize the full single mode functional, which leads to\nthe condition |\u03c8n |2 = \u2212an V /b and then to use Eq. (4).\nThe PC in in Eq. (5) interpolates smoothly between the\nGaussian and the mean field result.\nCase \u03c6 \u2248 1/2: A very interesting situation occurs at\nhalf integer values of \u03c6. The transition temperatures for\ntwo modes become equal, their coupling becomes crucial\n(\u03c6 \u2248 1/2 for definiteness), and we approximate [14]\n\u0011\nX\nb \u0010\nai |\u03c8i |2 +\n|\u03c80 |4 + |\u03c81 |4 + 4|\u03c80 |2 |\u03c81 |2 .(6)\nF=\n2Vol\ni=0,1\nCalculation of the PC in the presence of the coupling requires a generalization of the approach used for the single\nmode case [14, 23]. In Fig. 2 we display the PC i2 as calculated from Eq. (6) for three different temperatures,\nTc 21 < T < Tc , T = Tc 21 and T < Tc 21 . We compare it\nto the MF result as well as to i20 obtained by neglecting\nthe coupling |\u03c80 |2 |\u03c81 |2 in Eq. (6).\nAbove Tc\u03c6 (\u03b5 = \u22120.05 in Fig. 2), in the region where\nthe mean field result vanishes near half-integer flux, the\nPC is purely fluctuational. We deduce from Fig. (2) that\nthe coupling of the modes is crucial for \u03c7(1/2), but not\nfor the overall shape when T > Tc 12 . However, just below\nTc 21 (\u03b5 = \u22120.11 in Fig. 2) the coupling is essential. The\nmean field result is not applicable as it gives an infinitely\nsharp jump in the PC at half-integer flux. The result\nwithout coupling of the modes, i20 , gives a finite slope,\nbut it is far from the full current i2 that includes the mode\ncoupling. The coupling drives the current i2 towards the\nmean field approximation iMF which includes only one\nmode. This occurs because for a repulsive coupling the\ndominant mode suppresses the subdominant one. Indeed,\nif mode n = 0 is dominant then the coupling adds a mass\n2\nterm 2b/V \u03c802 |\u03c81 | to mode n = 1 and reduces its Tc .\nSusceptibility - We will now discuss in more detail\nthe slope at half-integer flux, which is most sensitive to\nthe coupling between the modes below, and to the nonGaussian fluctuations close to Tc . Differentiating the expression [23] for i2 we obtain\n\u03c7\u03c6=1/2 = \u03c7/(Tc /\u03c620 ) = 4\u039b g1 (x) \u2212 4\u039b2 g2 (x) , (7)\n\n\u03b5\nx = Gi\n+ 41 \u039b [24].

(7). Then one obtains \u03c71/2 = \u2212 4\u039b2 g2 (x).\nFor the susceptibility close to integer flux one easily obtains \u03c70 = 4\u039bf (x0 ) from Eq. (5). Comparing to the\nexpression for \u03c71/2 , we find Eq. (2).\nThis is the strong enhancement of \u03c71/2 compared to\n\u03c70 observed in the experiment [5]. Comparison with the\nnumerical calculation of Ref.

Inset: MF phase\ndiagram, superconducting region in grey.\n\nQuantum critical regime - So far we have discussed the\nlimit r = R/\u03be > 1, where the suppression of Tc is small\nand a finite temperature phase transition occurs. We will\nnow discuss the case where r = R/\u03be < 0.6 and Tc is reduced to zero at a critical flux \u03c6c near \u03c6 = 1/2, see Fig.1.\nNear the quantum critical point (QCP) it is no longer\nlegitimate to use the classical GL functional, in which\nonly the static component of the order parameter field\nis considered. Instead, all Matsubara frequencies should\nbe taken into account in the imaginary time formalism.\nThe full fluctuation propagator is given by:\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014\nT\n1\n1 \u03b1n + |\u03a9k |/2\n\u22121\n(\u03bdL)nk = ln\n\u2212\u03c8\n, (8)\n+\u03c8\n+\nTc\n2\n2\u03c0T\n2\nwhere \u03b1n (\u03c6) = 21 RD2 (n \u2212 \u03c6)2 and \u03a9k = 2\u03c0kT are\nbosonic Matsubara frequencies [26, 27]. Following the\nstandard approach, we first find the critical line \u03c6(T )\n\n\f4\nin the temperature-flux plane by equating L\u22121\n00 = 0.\nFor the QCP\nat\nT\n=\n0\none\nobtains\nthe\ncritical\nflux\n\u221a\n\u03c6c = \u03c0r/(2 2\u03b3E ), \u03b3E \u2248 1.78 [3]. Due to the fluxperiodicity of the phase diagram, the QCP can only be\nobserved\n\u221a in the ring geometry if \u03c6c < 1/2 which implies\nr < 2\u03b3E /\u03c0 \u2248 0.6. Notice that this critical value of\nr = R/\u03be is 20% larger than a naive application of the\nquadratic approximation valid for r \u226b 1 would suggest.\nRestricting ourselves to the interval \u03c6 \u2208 (0, 0.5) we\nfind that near the QCP it is sufficient to consider the\nn = 0 mode. In the Gaussian regime we obtain (cf.\nFig 1) the following\nto the PC\nP fluctuation contribution\u22121\niG = \u2212 Tc2\u03bd\u03c6\nL\n[28].\nExpanding\nL\nin small\nT\n0\nk 0k\n\u03c62 (T )\n\u2206\u03b1 = [\u03b10 (\u03c6) \u2212 \u03b1(\u03c6(T ))]/\u03b10 (\u03c6c ) we find with logarith\u03c6\u2192\u03c6c\n2 1\nh(\u2206\u03b1, t),\nmic accuracy iG = \u2212 \u03c016\u03c6\n2 r 2 h(\u2206\u03b1, t) \u2212\u2192 \u2212 \u03b3\nE \u03c6c\ns\n1\n\u2206\u03b1\nh(\u2206\u03b1, t) = ln \u2206\u03b1 + 2s \u2212 \u03c8(1 + s), s = 2\u03b3E t and t = T /Tc.\nA few remarks are in order concerning this result.\nThe second term in the expression for h is the classical \u03a9 = 0 contribution to the sum. The upper cutoff for the frequency summation has been chosen as\n\u03a9 = 2\u03b10 (\u03c6(T )) [29]. The function h has the asymptotic\nform h \u2248 \u03b3E t/\u2206\u03b1 + ln(1/2\u03b3E t) for \u2206\u03b1 \u226a t \u226a 1 and\nh \u2248 ln 1/\u2206\u03b1 for t \u226a \u2206\u03b1 \u226a 1. It is important that \u2206\u03b1 is\nT -dependent and in order to reveal the full T -dependence\nof iG one should first find the transition line \u03b10 (\u03c6(T )).\nh(T ) is displayed in Fig. 3. The maximum of h at finite\nT is a result of two competing mechanisms. As T grows\nfrom zero, thermal fluctuations become stronger. At the\nsame time the distance to the critical line becomes larger\nfor fixed \u03c6, which eventually leads to a decrease of iG .\n25\n\n\u2206\u03b10 = 0.001\n\nh\n\nt=1\n\n20\nt=0\n\n0\n\n15\n10\n\n\u03c6c\n\n\u03c6 1\n\n0.005\n0.01\n\n5\n\n0.05\n0\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\nt\n\n0.1\n\nFIG. 3: The function h that determines the PC close to the\nQCP, iG \u2248 \u2212 \u03b32E \u03c61c h, as a function of t = T /Tc for given\n\u2206\u03b10 \u2248 2(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6c )/\u03c6c . \u03c6c = 2r\u221a\u03c02\u03b3 is the critical flux at\nE\nT = 0 and \u03b3E \u2248 1.78. h is defined in the text.

For larger rings\n\nas studied in recent experiments we obtained detailed\nanalytical predictions for the strong fluctuation region.\nWe thank E. Altman, H. Bary-Soroker, A. I. Buzdin,\nA. M.
