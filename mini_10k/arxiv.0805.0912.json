The\ncoating thickness is thus governed by the operating parameters\n(speeds and loading), mechanical properties of the solids and\nthe mechanical properties of the fluid. The general features of\nroll coating operations involving a deformable roll have been\ndescribed by Coyle [115].\nTABLE I\nMaterial properties\nviscosity\n\nRelaxation time\n\n0.0013\n\n0.15\n\n0.01\n\nCoating with 0.6% of\ninhibitors\n\n8.91\n\n0.3\n\n0.01\n\nCoating with 1% of\ninhibitors\n\n15.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.01\n\nMaterial properties\nCoating color\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLast few years, researchers have used the lubrication theory as\nwell as Navier Stokes equations (CFD models) to investigate\nreverse roll coating flows [1-7]. For the lubrication theory, the\nmain hypothesis is that inertia effects are minimal and therefore\nneglected. The flow can be represented by dP/dx = \u03bc\n( 2 x/ y2) [1].\nGreener and Middleman [1], using both vanishing pressure and\npressure gradient as boundary conditions, predicted the coating\nthickness on the transfer roll for a relatively narrow range of\nmetering rod to transfer roll speed, although the flow rate\ndeviated from the predictions of the model due to some\nrecirculation upstream from the nip.\nCoyle et al. [3] showed that the metered nip flow deviates from\nthe lubrication theory predictions at high speed ratios and\ncapillary numbers. The dynamic wetting line moves towards\nthe nip center, the nip length shrinks, and the film thickness\n\n\u00a9EDA Publishing/DTIP 2008\n\nFig. 1. mesh computational mesh generation .\n\nFig. 2. the velocity contour in the micro-nip\n\nII.\nA.\n\nNUMERICAL ANALYSIS\n\nSimulation\n\nOur interest is in studying the coating-visco-elastic flow in\nMicro- nip.

Since\nthe liquid is visco-elastic, therefore, our interest was to find\nout the best visco-elastic model fit the experimental data.\nHere we present a quantitative fitting of KBKZ model to the\nexperimental data of coating color without inhibitor and\ncoating colors with 0.6% and 1%. The data show that the\nsolution is shear thinning at low shear rate. The curve fitting\nshows that the KBKZ is the best model can fit the\nexperimental data. Where KBKZ model is an integral\nviscoelastic model. The KBKZ model provides additional\naccuracy by including a damping function in its constitutive\nequations. The KBKZ model can calculate the extra stress\ntensor. The flow phenomena observed with non-Newtonian\nfluids cannot be predicted by the classical Navier-Stokes\nequation. Non-Newtonian behavior has many facets. One of\nthem is the shear rate dependence of the shear viscosity.\nTherefore, we need to propose a model to describe the flow\nbehavior of non-Newtonian fluid. The CFD package\nPOLYFLOW 3.92 (FLUENT COMPANY) is used to solve\nNavier-Stokes equations and the proposed model. This CFD\npackage uses the finite element method. It enables the use of\ndifferent discretization schemes and solution algorithms,\ntogether with various types of boundary conditions. As part\nof the same package, (a preprocessor) Gambit is used to\ndraw the geometry and generate the required grid for the\nsolver. An unstructured grid with triangle elements is used as\nshown in Figure 1. The upper and lower walls were divided\ninto non-uniformly spaced elements using pave meshing\nscheme with a ratio 0.1. The steady shear viscosity for\ncoating colors depends on the concentration of added\ninhibitors. The viscous and elastic moduli of coating colors\nincrease with increasing concentration of inhibitors, which is\nrelated to strong interaction between the particles.\nSince the viscosity is increasing with increasing the\nyellowing inhibitor, the viscosity of the coating liquid with\n1% inhibitor was 0.7 pa.s, the viscosity of coating liquid\nwith 0.6% inhibitor was 0.3 pa.s and the viscosity of coating\nliquid without inhibitor was 0.15 pa.s. the relaxation time\nwas 0.01.\nB.\n\n9-11 April 2008\nexpressed by:\n(4)\n(5)\n\nand\n\nIn Equation (1), i is the index of the relaxation mode and \u03b8\nis a scalar parameter that controls the ratio of the normalstress differences:\n(6)\nand H is the damping function.\nThe\nPapanastasiou-Scriven-Macosko\ncomputes H from\n\nmodel\n\n(7)\nwhere \u03b1 is a material parameter that primarily influences the\nshear-thinning behavior.
