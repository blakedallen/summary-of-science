RNA can have\nautocatalytic properties, which led to the idea of an\nearly \"RNA world\" (Gilbert 1986, Joyce 1991) where\nnaked RNA molecules could have catalyzed the polymerization of other RNA molecules. But since the\nRNA molecule consists of right-handed sugars, chirality selection must have occurred at an even earlier\nstage.\nTwo possibilities are commonly discussed. Either\nchirality was imposed by physical factors such as\nmagnetic fields, polarized light from a nearby pulsar, or even the tiny energetic preference due to the\nparity-breaking electroweak interaction. In such a\nscenario, homochirality may well have been a prerequisite for the origin of life, allowing for example for\nthe assembly of structurally more stable polymers.\nThe difficulty here is that such mechanisms would\nhardly explain the complete homochirality observed\nin living matter. The other possibility is that homochirality was a consequence of life, and that the\npresently prevailing handedness was selected spontaneously during the assembly of the first polymers. As\nshown in the early paper by Frank (1953), such a process requires the production of left and right handed\nmolecules to be mutually antagonistic. He devised\npairs of ordinary differential equations demonstrating\nhow this could possibly be described mathematically.\nThe latter scenario is the one we consider also\nin the present paper. Significant progress has been\nmade since Frank's early paper. In particular, the\n\nThe emergence and spreading of chirality on the early\nEarth is considered by studying a set of reactiondiffusion equations based on a polymerization model.\nIt is found that effective mixing of the early oceans is\nnecessary to reach the present homochiral state.

Key\nWords: Homochirality \u2013 Origin of life \u2013 Exobiology.\n\nIntroduction\nThe question of the origin of life is closely connected\nwith the question of how handedness (chirality) of\nliving organisms came about (Avetisov et al. 1991).\nThe sugars produced in plants via photosynthesis, for\nexample via the rather innocently looking reaction\n6 CO2 + 6 H2 O \u2192 C6 H12 O6 + 6 O2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nare all right-handed and rotate the polarization\nplane of polarized light in a right-handed sense, i.e.\nthe sugar is said to be dextrorotatory. This preferred handedness is remarkable because the difference in binding energy between right-handed and lefthanded (levorotatory) sugars is extremely tiny (relative energy difference: 10\u221217 ). Once dead, the preferred handedness gradually disappears until there\nare equally many right and left handed molecules.\nThis process, which speeds up with increasing temperature, is called racemization and can even be used\nas an approximate dating method (Hare & Mitterer\n1967, Bada et al. 1970). For a simpler and closely\nrelated reaction that displays a similar behavior we\n1\n\n\flonger grow. As discussed in the introduction, this\nrule is motivated by the experiments of Joyce et al.\n(1984) and others.\nThe monomers are initially generated from a substrate S according to\n\norigin of the mutually antagonistic behavior has been\nidentified to be the so-called enantiomeric crossinhibition, a process that spoils further polymerization once a monomer of opposite handedness has been\nattached to an already existing polymer. The evidence for the occurrence of this process is entirely\nexperimental and goes back to the early work of\nJoyce et al. (1984), who found that in non-enzymatic\ntemplate-directed polymerization of RNA strands,\nonly a homochiral supply of mononucleotides that are\ncomplementary to the template can polymerize to a\ntypical length of 20 nucleotides. Even a small amount\nof mononucleotides of opposite chirality prevents the\nformation of longer polymers, as is seen in high performance color chromatograms. Similar experiments\nhave subsequently also been carried out by Schmidt\net al. (1997) and Kozlov et al. (1998), for example.\nIn the following we describe in more detail how this\nprocess can be modeled.\n\nk C\n\nS C\u2212\u2192R R1 ,\n\nIn the polymerization model of Sandars (2003)\nlarge polymers are generated by joining successive\nmonomers into long chains. Monomers can be both\nleft, L1 , and right, R1 , handed, and longer chains\nare formed according to the following set of reaction\nequations:\n2kS\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nLn+1 ,\n\n(2)\n\nLn + R1\n\n2kI\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nLn R1 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nLn+1 R1 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nR1 Ln R1 ,\n\n(5)\n\nL1 + Ln R1\nR1 + Ln R1\n\nkS\nkI\n\n(6)\n\nwhere kC is proportional to the regeneration rate of\nmonomers, and CR and CL determine the enzymatic\nenhancement of right and left handed monomers.\nThe dependence of CL,R on the existing amount of\npolymer chains is essential to chirality selection as\nthen an existing excess of either chirality can be amplified. The exact form of P\nC is not crucial and here\nwe follow the choice CA = n An , A = L, R (Brandenburg et al. 2005, hereafter referred to as BAHN).\nFor alternative prescriptions of CA we refer to the papers by Sandars (2003) and Wattis & Coveney (2005).\nThe substrate itself is being replenished by a constant\nsource term Q.\nThe polymerization process is represented pictorially in Fig. 1, where one can see how monomers begin to grow into longer chains and can then be contaminated by a monomer of opposing chirality. The\ncrossed out chains represent polymers that can no\nlonger grow.\nThe feedback mechanism built into the polymerization model leads to an unstable system that, depending on the fidelity f of the enzymatic reactions, when\nperturbed from the initial racemic state can reach a\nhomochiral state. The prescription for CA discussed\nabove assumes f = 1. If f < 1, there is some 'crosstalk' between L and R where f determines the relative mixing between the two chiralities.\nThe chirality of a particular state is conveniently\nparameterized by a parameter called the enantiomeric excess:\n\nThe polymerization model\n\nLn + L1\n\nk C\n\nC L\nL1 ,\nS \u2212\u2192\n\nwhere kS and kI are the reaction coefficients for\nmonomers to a polymer of the same or of the opposite handedness, respectively. For all four equations\nwe also have the complementary reactions obtained\nby exchanging L \u21c0\n\u21bd R. Note that chains are 'spoiled'\nif a monomer of opposite chirality is attached to the\nend of a longer chain, in which case the chain can\nonly grow at the other end. This is in essence what\nis meant by enantiomeric cross-inhibition. As a results, polymers such as R1 L2 R1 and L1 R1 can no\n\n\u03b7\u2261\n\nER \u2212 EL\n,\nER + EL\n\n(7)\n\nP\nwhere EA =\nn An with A = L, R. For f larger\nthan a critical value (see BAHN for details), the\nracemic state (\u03b7 = 0) is unstable with respect to small\nperturbations. Only for f = 1, the end state is fully\nhomochiral (\u03b7 = \u00b11).\n2\n\n\fFigure 2: Different ways of reaching a homochiral\nstate from an initial racemic state\nFigure 1: Polymerization process. In addition to a\nnumber of monomers, L and R, there are several isotactic dimers, LL and RR, as well as longer polymers.\nSemi-spoiled polymers such as LLLLR and LRRR\ncan still polymerize on the unspoiled end. Polymers\nsuch as LR and RLLR are dead and cannot polymerize further.\n\nThis question is not restricted to the model considered here and needs to be addressed in all models\nwhere chirality is selected locally by a random process.\nThe critical ingredients necessary to answer these\nquestions are the presence of different relevant time\nscales. If the appearance of a homochiral region is\na rare process, say with a period of \u03c4life , and the\nglobal homochiralization time scale, \u03c4global , is short\ncompared to that, i.e. \u03c4global \u226a \u03c4life , then one would\nnot expect coexisting regions of different chirality.\nIn other words, if the emergence of life is a rare\nevent, then life forms with different handedness did\nnot probably coexist. This is the case modeled by\nFrank (1953) and many others after him. In the other\nextreme case, homochiral regions appear frequently\ncompared to the speed at which they can dominate\nthe early Earth, leading to coexisting regions of opposite chirality (see Fig. 2). Even though here we\nare mainly concerned with chirality, such arguments\ncan be applied more generally to the emergence and\nspreading of life as well. For a discussion of the possibility of finding a second sample of life on Earth see\nthe recent paper by Davies & Lineweaver (2005).\nThe spreading of chirality and coexistence of regions of different chirality was studied in Brandenburg and Multam\u00e4ki (2004), hereafter referred to\nas BM. There a reduced polymerization model with\nspatial extent was considered analytically and by\nnumerical simulations. The importance of spatial\nextent has already been emphasized by Saito and\n\nHomochiralization in space\nThe homochiralization process considered here and,\nindeed, in much of the theoretical literature on the\nsubject (e.g., Frank 1953, Wei-Min 1982, Goldanskii\nand Kuzmin 1989, Avetisov & Goldanskii 1993, Sandars 2003, Saito and Hyuga 2004a) has been uniform\nin space. Relaxing this restriction can, in principle,\nlead to completely new chirality selection mechanisms\nthat have no analogue in models without spatial extend. An example is the mechanism identified by\nToxvaerd (2004) using molecular dynamics simulations. In the present work we simply extend the\nhomochiralization process discussed in the previous\nsection to allow for the interaction with neighboring\nregions through diffusion and/or advection (such as\nocean currents). We begin with a state that is homochiral everywhere, but that there are minute imbalances in space, i.e. infinitesimally small perturbations. These perturbations grow locally, leading to\npatches with enantiomeric excess of either handedness. It is then natural to ask how a localized homochiral state spreads to a racemic surroundings and,\nmoreover, can regions of different chirality coexist?\n3\n\n\fHyuga (2004b) who generalized the model of Saito\nand Hyuga (2004a) by using a Monte-Carlo method\nas it is used in percolation studies.\nThe behavior of the reduced model can be understood qualitatively: an initial racemic mixture with\nsmall local perturbations quickly relaxes locally to\nregions of different chirality. Hence, in this work the\nemergence of life was considered to be a frequent and\nrapid event. The oppositely handed regions then begin to spread spatially into any possibly remaining\nracemic regions by front propagation until they come\nin contact with a region of opposite chirality. In 1 + 1\ndimensions (one space and one time dimension) there\nis no further evolution and one can view the process\nas spontaneous symmetry breaking leading to stable, non-propagating domain walls. In more than one\nspatial dimension, the homochiralization process progresses further. If no advection is present, only diffusion can drive the homochiralization process. Analytical arguments can be utilized to show that a bubble\nsurrounded by a region of opposite chirality tends\nto shrink. Since the equations are local, the local\ncurvature of the front is the deciding property in determining which way a front will move. An example\nof this process is shown in Fig. 3, where we show a\n2 + 1 dimensional box with regions of different chirality. The initial state in the simulation was a racemic\nstate with small fluctuations so that one quickly arrives at a state where there are many left and right\nhanded regions in the box. Here we show the evolution of these homochiral regions. From the figure it\nis easy to see that the curvature of the interface indeed determines the evolution of a region: e.g. small\nbubbles shrink and later disappear.\nAgain, time scales play a crucial role in the global\nhomochiralization process. Using microphysically\nmotivated values, we find that the local relaxation to\na homochiral state is rapid compared to that of the\npropagation of fronts into racemic surroundings. In\nturn, this is a much faster process than the final stage\nin global homochiralization when the regions of different chirality slowly disappear as described above.\nUsing values of molecular diffusion, one actually finds\nthat this time scale on Earth is much too long to explain the observed homochiral final state.\nIn order to study the process further, we have also\n\nFigure 3: The spreading of homochiral regions in 2+1\ndimensions. The dark (light) regions correspond to\nleft (right) handed regions. Time is given in global\ndiffusion times, \u03c4turb = L2 /\u03ba. (Adapted from BM.)\n\nconsidered the effects of advection on homochiralization. An example in 2 + 1 dimensions is shown in\nFig. 4. The mixing process is now greatly enhanced\nand one finds that the global homochiral state is\nreached much more rapidly. The actual time scale\ndepends strongly on the strength of the flow, e.g. for\nroot mean square flow of 1 cm/s, the time scale of\nglobal homochiralization is of the order of 30 years.\nIt is then clear that if the model considered in BM\ncaptures the relevant features of chirality selection on\nthe early Earth, the effective mixing of early oceans\nis vital. As the mixing is affected by many factors\nsuch as the existence of continents and salinity of sea\nwater, it is not difficult to speculate that in some secluded parts of the early oceans, life forms of different\nchirality could have coexisted.\nSo far we have considered the spreading in two horizontal directions, which is relevant to the Earth's surface where the vertical dynamics may be eliminated\nby vertical averaging. However, BM also considered\nthree-dimensional models and found that the speed of\n4\n\n\fFigure 5: The spreading of homochiral regions in 3 + 1 dimensions.

(Adapted from BM.)\n(0.08...0.15)urmsl, where urms is the root mean square\nvelocity of the turbulence and l is the typical length\nscale of the turbulent eddies. It should be emphasized, however, that such a description of turbulent\n5\n\n\fcommon, \u03c4ext \u226a (\u03c4life , \u03c4global ), and so any emergent\nlife will quickly be wiped out \u2013 at least locally. Again,\nif \u03c4global \u226a \u03c4life , it is unlikely that life will re-emerge\nspontaneously in the affected areas, and these areas\nwill more likely be re-populated by the spreading of\nthe homochiral regions surrounding the now racemic\narea. Thus, in this case homochirality is preserved.\nOn the other hand, if \u03c4life \u226a \u03c4global , the possibility of\nmass extinctions allows for new life forms to emerge\nwhich, in turn, may prolong the time during which\nlife forms of opposite chirality can have coexisted.\nIt is not immediately obvious how mass extinctions should be modeled within the framework of the\nBAHN model. It seems plausible that a mass extinction due to an impact, for example, can be modeled\nby removing all existing polymers. The re-emergence\nof life depends on the source term Q of the substrate\nand on the kC parameter that controls the rate at\nwhich new monomers are created from the substrate.\nBy locally suppressing Q or kC as a consequence of\nthe mass extinction, one can model the reduced habitability by slowing down the generation either of the\nsubstrate or of new monomers from the source. Alternatively, one could decrease the polymerization efficiency by decreasing kS and kI on the grounds that\nthese parameters are likely to depend on external factors such as temperature, salinity, and acidity.\nAllowing for the additional dependencies discussed\nabove introduces certainly a lot of additional uncertainties, but it also removes some of the sensitivity to\ninitial conditions. If the conditions for chirality (or\nlife) are not satisfied everywhere, the spreading of\nchirality will stop and mass extinctions can eradicate\nthe emergent life forms. Hence, there are various approaches to modeling the emergence of life and mass\nextinctions in the BAHN model. Either one can deplete the source of the substrate, or one can diminish\nthe conversion rates for monomer formation and/or\nfor polymerization, in which case the substrate might\nstill be present everywhere.\nClearly, these considerations are relevant in a more\nrealistic model and, furthermore, can bring interesting new dynamics into the system. As such they are\nworth considering in more detail and future work will\nhopefully bring us answers to these questions. Detailed numerical models of this process may elucidate\n\nmixing is rather rudimentary and ignores, for example, the fact that the shape of left and right handed\ndomains is quite different with and without turbulence: it is more round in the case of molecular diffusion and more elongated in the turbulent case. The\nlatter is a feature of the turbulence to mix fields by\nstretching and folding. A snapshot of a fully threedimensional simulation1 showing the concentration of\nleft handed building blocks is presented in Fig. 5.\n\nEmergence and spreading of life\non the early Earth\nWe have made a number of underlying assumptions\nin studying the spreading of homochiral domains on\nthe early Earth. Firstly, we have assumed that the\ninitial state is globally racemic. This implies that the\nconditions were life could have emerged are uniform\nand favorable everywhere and, furthermore, that a\nhomochiral region can spread and fill the whole domain. Secondly, we have assumed that the emergence\nof life is a common event and that it is possible everywhere on earth, and that there are no mass extinctions. These assumptions may not necessarily be\nrealistic, and one should consider what new effects\ncan possibly arise from relaxing these assumptions.\nConsidering the possibility of mass extinctions and\nthat the emergence of life can be a rare event, it is\nclear that a new time scale, \u03c4ext , is inserted into the\nprocess. Assuming that mass extinctions are local\nevents (i.e. not all life is destroyed in which case the\nprocess can start again), the relative lengths of the\ndifferent time scales determine the qualitative dynamics of the system. If \u03c4global \u226a \u03c4life \u226a \u03c4ext , life\nappears somewhere and takes over the whole system\nbefore life of opposite chirality can emerge. Any later\nmass extinction events will be insignificant as the\ndominant chirality will quickly win over the achiral\nregion. If \u03c4life \u226a \u03c4global \u226a \u03c4ext , we have the situation considered earlier in this paper, where regions of\ndifferent chirality compete.
