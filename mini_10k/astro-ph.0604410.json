Intellectual honesty, however, tells\nus that a better fit may then not signal evidence for the\ntheory, but merely unfair advantage over its competitors.\nConfronted with two theories fitting the data equally well\nwe'd prefer the simpler one, the theory containing fewer\nparameters or based on a less complicated model.\nSuch considerations form the basis of Occam's razor,\nbut a quantitative formulation is notoriously hard to\ncome by. It's clear that the real \"evidence\" should combine the naive goodness of fit with a penalty function\nmeasuring the complexity of the theory. But several distinct rationales for doing this may be found in the literature, notably the Akaike [1] and Bayesian [2] information\ncriteria (AIC and BIC) and the Turing machine based\ncriterion proposed by one of us [3]. Simplicity, it seems,\nis in the eye of the beholder.\nFurthermore, subjective double standards seep into\nthe analysis, and the rigors of penalization are often\nreserved to results one doesn't like. For example, the\nCMB community has resisted applying Occam's razor to\ninflationary parameters (see [4, 5, 6] for notable exceptions) and to some power spectrum features [9, 10]; but\nwith reference to anomalies unpalatable to just about\neveryone (such as the \"axis of evil\" effect, the embarrassing statistical anisotropy exhibited on the largest angular scales [11, 12, 13]), the strictest penalization is enforced [15]. (The criterion employed therein to scrutinize\nthe axis of evil effect is loosely the AIC.)\nWe applaud this type of application of Occam's razor,\nbut we believe it should be employed impartially. The\npurpose of the present paper is to examine some of the\nproposed Occam razors, and to apply them democratically to both \"likable\" and \"undesirable\" features in the\nlarge-angle CMB anisotropy. We examine the WMAP\ndata [15, 16, 17], in its first and third year releases, and\nin various renditions dealing differently with the galactic\n\nplane. We focus on claims for departures from scale invariance and for reionization (Section II), the evidence for\na low quadrupole and a low l power cut-off (Section III),\nand the strength of the detection of the so called axis of\nevil effect (Section IV).\nII.\n\nBRANDS OF OCCAM'S RAZOR\n\nWe first review some well-known criteria for evidence,\nadopting a notation similar to that of [3]. Let L be the\nlikelihood and k the number of parameters of the model.\nThey will be tuned so as to maximize the likelihood or,\nequivalently, minimize the information I. The information in the data given the theory is defined as minus the\nlogarithm of the likelihood. But in fact we want to minimize the information in the data and the theory together,\nthat is:\nI(D, T ) = I(D|T ) + I(T )\n\n(1)\n\nso that I(T ) is the penalty referred to above.\nAccording to some authorities, strong evidence for a\ntheory over a \"base model\" requires an improvement in\nI(D, T ) by at least 3 (see [7, 8]). The title of \"decisive evidence\" is not normally bestowed unless the improvement\nexceeds 5.\nAll the razors we will wield fit into the above scheme,\nbut they differ in how they define I(T ). According to the\nAkaike information criterion (AIC) the information in a\ntheory is simply its number of parameters, so that\nIA (D, T ) = \u2212 ln L + k.\n\n(2)\n\nThis is obtained by an approximate minimization of the\nKullback-Liebler information entropy.\nRather different is the the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), based on the penalty\nk\nln N\n(3)\n2\nwhere N is the number of data points being fit. It results\nfrom an approximation to the true Bayesian evidence,\nIB (T ) =\n\n\f2\ngiving the model a uniform prior. The full Bayesian evidence, where one integrates the likelihood over the full\nset of parameters, has also been considered.\nThe criterion developed in [3] interprets I(T ) entropically and algorithmically. It estimates the information in\na theory T in terms of the number of bits of \"memory\"\nrequired to store the parameters. From this point of view,\na theory's complexity depends not only on how many parameters it contains, but also on the precision with which\nthey are stored. The resulting penalty term I(T ) is not\nsimply a function of N and k but depends on the details\nof the theory. Typically it includes a term equal to (3) as\nwell as other terms that ensure that a theory with more\nparameters than data points will never be judged a good\nfit. The advantage this approach has over AIC and BIC\nis that it never has to appeal to the asymptotic approximation N \u226b 1. It's disadvantage is that it is harder\nto apply since I(T ) is not a simple universal function of\nN and k. In the spirit of the abbreviations \"AIC\" and\n\"BIC\" we will refer to this third razor as \"HIC\" or simply \"H\", since the differential goodness of fit is denoted\nby H in [3].\nThe various criteria do not always agree, even qualitatively. Take the statements that WMAP displays strong\nevidence for reionization and a spectrum of density fluctuation that is not scale invariant [15]. Both assertions\nrely on an improvement to the fit \u2206I(D|T ) \u2248 \u2206\u03c72 /2 =\n\u22124 (see Table 3 in [15]) and for both, this costs an extra\nparameter. Using AIC we get \u2206I(D, T ) = \u22123 pointing\ntoward a detection. But N is between 1500 and 3100, so\nln N is around 8. Using BIC this implies \u2206I(D, T ) \u2248 0,\nmost definitely not a detection. We have not worked out\nthe HIC value of I, but we would expect it to resemble BIC more than AIC, leading again to the verdict of\n\"no detection\". Of course one cannot drop both departures from scale invariance and reionization and there\nare strong astrophysical reasons for preferring reionization to a tilted spectrum. Therefore based on WMAP it\nseems prudent to say that there is no strong evidence for\nnS 6= 1.\nIII.\n\nIS THE QUADRUPOLE UNDERPOWERED?\n\nMuch attention has been paid to the low power observed in the lowest multipoles (l = 2 in particular), but\nhow strong is the evidence when shaved with Occam's\nrazor? This is essentially a problem of variance estimation. Given a sample and an externally inferred variance\n2\n2\n\u03c3E\n, when is it worth revising \u03c3E\nin the light of the sam2\nple? Here \u03c3E is obtained by appealing to a theory of the\nwhole spectrum, dependent only on a small number of\nparameters (e.g. \u03a9 and \u03a9\u039b ). These are fixed primarily\nby the higher multipoles (the Doppler peaks), so as far\n2\nis external.\nas the low multipoles are concerned \u03c3E\n2\nThe \"null hypothesis\" H0 is that \u03c3E is correct, and the\nobserved low power a fluke. Since the costs of estimating\n2\nare borne elsewhere, I(T ) = 0 and I(D, T ) = I(D|T ).\n\u03c3E\n\nThe catch is that the fit to the data is far from perfect.\nIntroducing the \"observed variance\" of the sample,\n1 X 2\n\u03c3S2 =\nxi\n(4)\nN\nwe have\n\u0015\n\u0014\nN\n\u03c3S2\n2\nI(D, T ) = \u2212 ln P (D|T ) =\nln \u03c3E + 2\n2\n\u03c3E\n\n(5)\n\nfar from its minimum.\nThe alternative hypothesis H1 is that the power is in2\ndeed low and that \u03c3E\nshould be replaced by an internal\nestimate, \u03c3I2 , obtained using the sample and bearing its\ncosts. The procedure for applying HIC can be adapted\nfrom [3] and goes as follows (the only novelty is that here\nthe average is known). Firstly, we minimize I(D|T ), with\nsolution \u03c3I2 = \u03c3S2 . This cannot be stored to infinite accuracy, so we expand around the minimum:\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0003\nN\u0002\n\u2206\u03c3\n2\nI(D|\u03c3S , \u2206\u03c3) =\nln \u03c3S + 1 + N\n.\n(6)\n2\n\u03c3S\nAveraging over a uniform distribution in \u2206\u03c3 \u2208\n(\u2212\u03b4\u03c3/2, \u03b4\u03c3/2) gives h\u2206\u03c3 2 i = \u03b4\u03c3 2 /12, so that:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0003 N \u03b4\u03c3 2\nN\u0002\n2\nln \u03c3s + 1 +\n.\n(7)\nI(D|\u03c3S , \u03b4\u03c3) =\n2\n12 \u03c3S\nThe storage penalty, on the other hand, is\nI(T ) = \u2212 ln\n\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03c3S\n\nso I(D, T ) is minimized for optimal accuracy:\nr\n6\n\u03c3S .\n\u03b4\u03c3 =\nN\nThus the information in the data and H1 is\nr\nN\n6\n1\n2\nI(D, T ) = [ln \u03c3S + 1] + \u2212 ln\n2\n2\nN\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nThe evidence H against the null hypothesis H0 is the difference between its information and that in H1 (positive\nH favors H1).

Generalization for many independent parameters is straightforward.\nIn Table I we examine the evidence for a low\nquadrupole. We consider the first year data as in [17]\n(ILC1) and in [18] (TOH), as well as the third year release [16], both the debiased internal linear combination\nmap (DILC) and the MLE estimate (WMAP3). Clearly\nunder Occam's razor we can never claim a significant\ndetection, whatever the dataset. Adding the octupole\nand other low l does little to improve the situation. Visual inspection of the plots in [16] shows that many of\nthese low l \"anomalies\" have disappeared in the three\nyear data. But they were never significant, as the analysis of the first year data presented in Table II shows.\nNaturally Hf improves as more and more multipoles are\nconsidered, but these bring in new parameters and so\nthe associated \"detections\" are erased under the weight\nof Occam's razor. This table refers to first year TOH; in\nother datasets/renditions the evidence is even lower. By\nbringing more ls into the analysis the evidence decreases\nfurther.\nNone of this will surprise several authors [18, 19, 20,\n21, 22]; yet, to drive the point home we stress that the\nevidence for a low quadrupole \u2013 bad as it is \u2013 is still\nstronger than the evidence for a non scale invariant spectrum under the BIC. Also the message has yet to fully filter to enthusiastic theorists (e.g. [9]). For example claims\nhave been made [24] that DGP gravity [23] fits better the\nlow l spectrum. While it might be true that the theory\nachieves a better fit without introducing new parameters\n(and therefore doesn't fall prey of further penalties) the\nfact remains that it corrects a misfit that is not significant\nto begin with.\nIV.\n\nTABLE II: Evidence (or lack thereof) for low power at small\nl using the most sympathetic dataset (TOH).\n\nTHE AXIS OF EVIL\n\nMany paths lead to the axis of evil.

There is nothing anomalous with the planarity of l = 2 and l = 3, taken on their\nown. It's the fact that the planarity occurs in roughly the\nsame direction (and with roughly the same suppression ratio\n\u01eb) for both multipoles that substantiates the anomaly.\nData\n\nls\n2\nTOH\n3\n2-3\n2\nWMAP3 3\n2-3\n\n(b\n58\n62\n61\n70\n62\n64\n\nl)\n-103\n-121\n-113\n-127\n-122\n-123\n\n\u01eb\n.030\n.025\n.032\n.036\n.035\n.038\n\nHf\n3.09\n5.06\n7.48\n2.84\n4.29\n6.89\n\nH AIC\n0.09\n2.06\n4.48\n-0.16\n1.29\n3.89\n\nH BIC\n0.68\n2.14\n3.76\n0.43\n1.37\n3.16\n\npreference statistics [13] are examples. Here we focus\non the planarity of l = 2, 3, that is, the fact that in the\nframe pointing to (b, l) \u2248 (60, \u2212100) in Galactic coordinates, the power is concentrated in the m = \u00b1l modes.\nHow seriously should we take this?\nThe more abstract estimation problem is: when is it\njustified splitting the alm sample into sub-samples with\ndifferent variances? This is a variation on the calculation\nin the previous section with a subtlety: the result is frame\ndependent. Consider a sample with N elements and sample variance \u03c3S2 (the 2l + 1 modes of a multipole), and\ntwo sub-samples with N1 and N2 elements and sample\n2\n2\nvariance \u03c3S1\nand \u03c3S2\n(the planar modes m = \u00b1l, and all\nthe others). The difference in I(D|T ) between the null\nhypothesis (don't split the sample) and the alternative\nhypothesis (split) is\nHf = ln\n\n\u03c3SN\nN1 N2\n\u03c3S1 \u03c3S2\n\n(15)\n\n2\n2\nwhere N = N1 + N2 and N \u03c3S2 = N1 \u03c3S1\n+ N2 \u03c3S2\n. This\ndepends only on the suppression ratio\n\n\u01eb=\n\n2\n\u03c3S2\n2\n\u03c3S1\n\n(16)\n\nand therefore one can consider the issue of planarity even\nif the evidence for an internal \u03c3S2 is small or nonexistent.\nThe value of \u01eb depends on the z-axis coordinates (b, l),\nwhich should be chosen to maximize Hf . In the process\nwe add two more parameters to the Occam's razor bill.\nThis is the procedure adopted for analyzing each multipole independently and in Table III we present results\n\n\f4\nfor two datasets: TOH and the WMAP three year data.\nWe find that Hf is around 3 for l = 2 and 5 for l = 3,\nat the cost of introducing 3 parameters (the axis and the\nratio of power \u01eb) for each multipole. Using AIC this degrades Hf to a H around 0 and 2, respectively. Results\nfor the BIC are reported in the same table. As in previous studies [11, 13] we find no serious evidence for an\nanomaly if each multipole is taken on its own. Given a\nrandom, statistically isotropic multipole there is always\na frame in which most of the power is concentrated in a\nsingle m; that this m equals l is not unlikely for small l.\nWhat turns the axis of evil into a menace is that the\nmaximal Hf for l = 2 and l = 3 is reached with roughly\nthe same parameters (see values in Table III). Thus if we\ntake a single axis and \u01eb chosen so as to maximize the total\nHT f = HQf + HOf , we obtain a HT f only slightly worse\nthan the sum of the separate optimal HQf and HOf ;\nthe parameter cost, however, is halved. Our results are\ndescribed in Table III. The search for the joint axis was\ndone numerically, and we see that the result is heavily\nweighed by the octupole. The common \u01eb was found via\nthe method of Lagrange multipliers, i.e. by maximizing\n2\n2\n2\n2\nHT f = HQf + HOf \u2212 \u03bb[\u03c3Q1\n\u03c3O2\n\u2212 \u03c3O1\n\u03c3Q2\n]\n\n(17)\n\nwith solution:\n2\n\u03c3SQi\n1 \u00b1 A/2\n2\n\u03c3SOi\n=\n1 \u2213 A/2\n\n2\n\u03c3Qi\n=\n2\n\u03c3Oi\n\nwhere i = 1, 2 indexes the sub-samples and A is the solution of a quadratic equation expressing \u01ebO = \u01ebQ (an equation that only depends on the sample ratio \u01ebSO /\u01ebSQ .)\nAs shown in Table III our evidence for an anomaly is\nalways above H = 3, i.e. \"strong evidence\". One may\ntherefore wonder where is the discrepancy with the analysis in [15]? In that work the axis of evil was modeled as\na modulation by an underlying large-scale function, and\na model was found with Hf = 4 (a chi-squared improvement of 8) at a cost of 8 parameters. Using either AIC\nor BIC the value of H is therefore negligible. However,\nhere we exhibited a model improving the fit by about\nHf = 7 at a cost of 3 parameters. This (phenomenological) model is simply based on a diagonal covariant matrix\nfor l = 2, 3 of the form:\nh|alm |2 i(n) = cl (\u03b4l|m| + \u01eb(1 \u2212 \u03b4l|m| ))\n\n(18)\n\nHence the poor evidence reported in [15] is not a deficiency of the axis of evil effect or the data, but merely\na shortcoming of the proposed model itself. One can always find a model for any anomaly containing a number\nof parameters so large as to drive H down to a small\nvalue. But the issue is: what is the value of H for the\nbest model of that anomaly, the model with the optimal\ntrade off between fit and number of parameters? We have\ngone a fair way toward answering this question.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we subjected to some of Occam's razors three patterns that people have claimed to see in\nthe CMB data: departures from scale invariance, a low\nquadrupole, and the anisotropy that has come to be\nknown as the \"axis of evil\". Specifically, we considered\nthe razors that we called AIC, BIC and HIC. All three\nagreed to discount the claim for a low quadrupole, while\nin contrast, the two that we brought to bear on the axis\nof evil both suggested that it should be taken seriously.\nOnly in relation to scale-invariance was there disagreement, with AIC tending to accept the claim and BIC\ndefinitely rejecting it. (We did not consult HIC in connection with the first and third effects, but we plan to do\nso in a later version of this preprint.)\nIt is somewhat embarrassing that Occam razors can\ndisagree, but a glance at equations (2) and (3) reveals\nthat\n\u221a this is inevitable, since the penalty terms N and\nln N are very different when the number of data points\nN is \u226b 1. By comparing these two expressions, one\nsees that BIC will be more lenient than AIC when N is\nsmall, but much tougher when N is big (the crossover\ncoming around N = 7). For HIC, it is harder to make\na blanket statement, but experience has shown that it\ntends to agree more closely with BIC, probably since each\nrelies, in its own way, on a version of Bayes' rule.\nIn the case of the claimed departure from scaleinvariance, we would thus expect HIC to agree with BIC\nin favoring a negative verdict, which at the very least\nshould be added as a word of caution to the conclusions reported in [15]. By way of comparison, it's worth\npointing out that, even if we accept the more favorable\nvalue of H coming from AIC, the evidence for scale noninvariance is no better than that for the \"axis of evil\".\nWhen all razors agree on a lack of evidence, as is the\ncase with the underpowered quadrupole, one should definitely not lose sleep over the anomaly, and we hope keen\ntheorists will divert their creativity elsewhere.\nBut even when different razors agree on an anomaly \u2013\nsuch as the axis of evil \u2013 one should not trust the result\nblindly. The issue of systematics remains of paramount\nimportance, as shown by the significant differences in\nH obtained from the various datasets and methodologies used to deal with the galactic foregrounds. And\none should bear in mind that even the most enthusiastic \"Ockhamist\" would be unlikely to claim for his or\nher favorite razor a freedom from ambiguity[26] better\nthan \u2206H = \u00b10.3 or so. In addition it's probably fair\nto say that the trouble of rewriting cosmology textbooks\ndeserves in itself a penalty factor. This is hard to evaluate but it may translate into the requirement of a higher\nlevel of evidence than \"strong\", at the phenomenological\nlevel. Perhaps the ever improving polarization maps will\nhave a say on the matter and tilt the scales. This issue\nis currently being very actively investigated.\nAcknowledgments We'd like to thank Carlo Contaldi, Olivier Dor\u00e9 and Kate Land for discussion and\n\n\f5\ncomments.
