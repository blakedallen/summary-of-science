Invoking the Kirkwood superposition approximation yields a nonlinear integral equation for the pair correlation function1,2 . Interest in\nstudying the analytic and numerical properties of the resulting Yvon-Born-Green and/or\nKirkwood equation began with Kirkwood and coworkers3\u20136 , and continues to the present\nday7 . Of particular interest is whether the closed equation provides an essentially correct\ndescription of the fluid phase, and whether a (possible) change in the analytic character\nof the solutions signals a change from the fluid phase to a solid phase. It is to the latter\nquestion that the methods of the present contribution are directed.\nOne approach to explore analytically the possibility of a phase transition from the fluid\nphase to the solid phase is to mobilize the theory of nonlinear integral equations, focusing\non theorems which establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and\nuniqueness of solutions, and bifurcation points8\u201312 . An alternative approach is to introduce\na moment expansion by means of which the YBG equation can be cast into a nonlinear\ndifferential equation which may be used to analyze long-range correlations13,14 . The present\ncontribution is centered on a new method of studying the asymptotic decay of correlations,\nfirst introduced in Ref. 15 for the hard sphere fluid.\nIn this paper, we focus on the hard disk fluid. The method leads to the prediction\nof a structural transition in both the hard sphere and hard disk fluids, and no transition\nin the hard rod system (as must be the case). We shall show that the values of packing\nfractions at which the predicted transitions occur are in agreement with estimates derived\nfrom numerical solution of the Kirkwood equation6 and recent Monte Carlo simulations16 .\n\nII.\n\nTHE SECOND EQUILIBRIUM HIERARCHY EQUATION FOR HARD\n\nDISKS\nWe consider a gas of hard disks of diameter \u03c3 at thermal equilirium with constant number\ndensity n and temperature T .\nLet n2 (r12 ) denote the number density of pairs of particles situated at distance r12 =\n|r1 \u2212 r2 |. Using the fact that n2 (r12 ) = 0 for r12 < \u03c3 we introduce a dimensionless function\n2\n\n\fy2 (r12 ) defined by\nn2 (r12 ) = n2 \u03b8(r12 \u2212 \u03c3)y2 (r12 )\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8 is a unit step function.\nWe assume that n2 (r12 ) \u2192 n2 when r12 \u2192 \u221e. The two-particle dimensionless correlation\nfunction h2 (r12 ) is then defined by the cluster decomposition y2 (r12 ) = 1 + h2 (r12 ), so that\nn2 (r12 )\n= \u03b8(r12 \u2212 \u03c3)[1 + h2 (r12 )]\nn2\n\n(2)\n\nh2 (r12 ) is thus supposed to satisfy the asymptotic condition\nlim h2 (r12 ) = 0\n\nr12 \u2192\u221e\n\n(3)\n\nThe second equilibrium Yvon-Born-Green (YBG) hierarchy equation establishes an exact relation between n2 (r12 ) and the reduced three-particle number density n3 (r1 , r2, r3 ).\nIntroducing the excluded volume factor we write the three-particle density as\nn3 (r1 , r2 , r3 ) = \u03b8(r12 \u2212 \u03c3)\u03b8(r13 \u2212 \u03c3)\u03b8(r23 \u2212 \u03c3)n3 y3 (r12 , r13 , r23 )\n\n(4)\n\nThe function n3 depends only on the distances rij = |rij | = |ri \u2212 rj |, and is a symmetric\nfunction of the three variables r12 , r13 , r23 . In the case of hard disks y2 is related to y3 through\nthe second YBG hierarchy equation (see Appendix A)\nd\ny2 (r) = n\u03c3\ndr\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3\u0302(r\u0302 * \u03c3\u0302)\u03b8(|r \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c3\u0302| \u2212 \u03c3)y3 (r, \u03c3, |r \u2212 \u03c3 \u03c3\u0302|)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302 and r\u0302 are unit vectors |\u03c3\u0302| = |r\u0302| = 1.

As\nit is seen, the decay of H(x) becomes slower as the surface fraction is increased, and a\npronounced peak structure appears.\n\nIV.\n\nLINEARIZATION OF KIRKWOOD'S EQUATION: THE RING\n\nAPPROXIMATION\nBefore continuing the analysis based on equation (18) let us make a comment on the relationship between the superposition approximation and the ring approximation, well known\nfrom the kinetic theory (see15 and references given therein).\nOriginally, the ring approximation was applied to the study of long wavelength hydrodynamic phenomena, and was defined by neglecting in the second equation of the dynamical\nBBGKY hierarchy all contributions from the three-particle correlations. The three-particle\n6\n\n\fcorrelation function h3 is defined by the cluster decomposition of the density y3\ny3 (r12 , r13 , r23 ) = 1 + h2 (r12 ) + h2 (r13 ) + h2 (r23 ) + h3 (r12 , r13 , r23 )\n\n(22)\n\nNeglecting h3 is thus equivalent to the approximation\ny3 (r12 , r13 , r23 ) \u2243 1 + h2 (r12 ) + h2 (r13 ) + h2 (r23 )\n\n(23)\n\nIt is important here to note that while rejecting in the cluster decomposition (22) threeparticle correlations we nevertheless retain in the hierarchy equation the full excluded volume\nfactor represented by the product of unit step-functions (see definition (4)). In fact, this\nfactor represents the exact lowest order term in the density expansion of the three-particle\nnumber density, and is of fundamental importance for the correct description of hard disks\nat low densities.\nComparing (23) with the superposition formula\ny3 (r12 , r13 , r23 ) \u2243 [1 + h2 (r12 )][1 + h2 (r13 )][1 + h2 (r23 )]\n\n(24)\n\nwe see that the ring approximation corresponds exactly to the linearization of the Kirkwood\ntheory in h2 .\nThe linearized form of equation (12) reads\n(\nr\n\u0010 x \u00112\nd\n2\n[1 + H(1) + H(x)]\nH(x) = n\u03c3 \u22122\u03b8(2 \u2212 x) 1 \u2212\ndx\n2\n+\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\n0\n\np\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b8(x \u2212 2 cos \u03c6)H( x2 + 1 \u2212 2x cos \u03c6)\n\n(25)\n\n\u001b\n\nIn order to derive an integral equation for H(x) we proceed as before by integrating (25)\nover the spatial interval (x, \u221e). The result reads\nH(x) = 2n\u03c3 2 [J \u2217 (x) + J \u2217\u2217 (x)]\nwhere\nJ \u2217 (x) = \u03b8(2 \u2212 x)\n\n(\"\n\nx\n\u2212\n2\n\nr\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0010 x \u00112\n2\n\n#\n)\nZ 2 r\n\u0010 z \u00112\nx\n[1 + H(1)] +\ndz 1 \u2212\n+ arccos\nH(z)]\n2\n2\nx\n(26)\n\nand\n1\nJ (x) = \u2212\n2\n\u2217\u2217\n\nZ\n\nx\n\n\u221e\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\np\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u03b8(z \u2212 2 cos \u03c6)H( z 2 + 1 \u2212 2z cos \u03c6) = I \u2217\u2217 (x)\n7\n\n\f(see equation (16)).

Equation (28) can again be solved numerically by\niterations, and is expected to yield relevant results in the low density regime.\nThe comparison of the results obtained with the full Kirkwood approximation and its\nlinearization is presented in Fig. 2. Defining the surface fraction \u03be as\n\u03c32\n\u03be = n\u03c0\n4\n\n(29)\n\nwe plot here the compressibility factor Z(\u03be), given by\nZ(\u03be) =\n\n\u03c0\np\n= 1 + n\u03c3 2 (1 + H(1)) = 1 + 2\u03be(1 + H(1)),\nnkT\n2\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the contact value H(1) is also a function of \u03be.

Compressibility factor Z versus the surface fraction \u03be for the full Kirkwood approximation\n(circles), the ring approximation (squares), and the scaled particle theory (Eq. (31), dashed line)\n\nIn order to determine the behavior of H(x) at large distances, it seems natural to follow\nthe moment analysis presented in Refs. 13 and 14. The calculation would proceed as follows.\nFor x > 2, the Kirkwod equation (12) can be conveniently written as\nZ\nd\n2\nln[1 + H(x)] = n\u03c3 [1 + H(1)] d\u03c3\u0302(x\u0302 * \u03c3\u0302)H(|x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302|)\ndx\n\n(32)\n\nWhen x \u226b 1, the power series expansion of H(|x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302|) around the point |x| = x yields\nnonzero contributions only from terms involving odd powers of cos \u03c6 = (x\u0302 * \u03c3\u0302). The calculation up to the third derivative of H yields the expansion\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u2032\n2\n[ln[1 + H(x)] = n\u03c3 [1 + H(1)]\ncos \u03c6{\u2212 cos \u03c6 H \u2032(x)\n0\n\n1\n\u2212 [cos \u03c6 \u2212 (cos \u03c6)3 ]\n2\n\n\u0012\n\nH \u2032 (x)\nx\n\n\u0013\u2032\n\n1\n\u2212 (cos \u03c6)3 H \u2032\u2032\u2032 (x) + ...}\n6\n\nwhere \u2032 denotes the derivative with respect to x.\nUsing the boundary condition limx\u2192\u221e H(x) = 0 together with the equalities\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd\u03c6(cos \u03c6) = \u03c0,\n0\n\n0\n\n9\n\n2\u03c0\n\n3\nd\u03c6(cos \u03c6)4 = \u03c0,\n4\n\n(33)\n\n\fand adopting for large distances the asymptotic formula\nln[1 + H(x)] \u223c H(x)\nwe find a linear differential equation of the form\n1\nH \u2032\u2032 (x) + H \u2032(x) + \u03b12 H = 0\nx\n\n(34)\n\nwhere\n\u03b12 = 8(1 +\n\nn\u03c0\u03c3 2 [1\n\n1\n)>0\n+ H(1)]\n\nBut (34) is the equation for the Bessel function J0 (\u03b1x). The solution of (34) is thus an\n\u221a\noscillating function whose amplitude decays as 1/ x .\nUnfortunately, the above result is in disagreement with numerical predictions of exponentially damped oscillations. Use of the moment expansion as developed in Ref. 13 leads\nto erroneous results. Clearly one has to take into account the whole infinite series in the\nexpansion of H(|x \u2212 \u03c3\u0302|) to get reliable predictions. We have thus to give up this kind of\nexpansion, and look for a different approach.\nIn broad outline, the failure of the moment expansion developed in Refs. 13 and 14 to\ndescribe the structural transition in the hard disk fluid can be traced to the nature of the\ngoverning intermolecular potential. The studies13,14 deal with the description of correlations\nin the vicinity of the liquid-vapor critical point, where attractive forces play a dominant role.\nUsing the moment expansion, one recovers at large distances the classical Ornstein-Zernike\nformula. The present study deals with the fusion transition, where short-range, repulsive\nforces play the critical role. The new method introduced here (see Sec. V B) effectively\naccounts for the difference in the potential governing these two transitions and, anticipating\nour later results, leads to an analytic prediction of the packing fraction at which a structural\ntransition occurs in the hard disk (and hard sphere) fluid.\n\nB.\n\nPrediction of a structural transition\nLet us consider again the region x > 2 where the equation (32) holds. As limx\u2192\u221e H(x) =\n\n0, we can replace in (32) the function ln[1 + H(x)] by H(x), and consider the equation\nZ 2\u03c0\np\nA\nd\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6 H( x2 \u2212 2x cos \u03c6 + 1)\nH(x) =\n(35)\ndx\n2\u03c0 0\n10\n\n\fwhere\nA = 2\u03c0n\u03c3 2 [1 + H(1)]\nWe then use the expansion\np\n\nx2 \u2212 2x cos \u03c6 + 1 = x \u2212 cos \u03c6 +\n\nsin \u03c62\n+ ...\n2x\n\n(36)\n\nto arrive at the equation\nd\nA\nH(x) =\ndx\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0\n\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6 H(x \u2212 cos \u03c6),\n\n(37)\n\nvalid for x \u226b 1.\nIn order to determine the large x behavior of correlations we have thus to analyze the\nsolution of (37). We notice that all derivatives of H(x) satisfy the same equation. It is thus\nnatural to consider H(x) as a linear combination of exponential modes exp(\u03bax), where \u03ba is\na complex number. The function exp(\u03bax) satisfies (37) provided \u03ba solves the equation\nA\n\u03ba=\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n0\n\nd\u03c6 cos \u03c6 exp(\u2212\u03ba cos \u03c6) = \u2212AI1 (\u03ba)\n\n(38)\n\nwhere I1 (\u03ba) is a modified Bessel function. The physically acceptable solutions \u03ba = a + ib are\nthose with negative real part a < 0 which assures exponential damping of oscillations. The\nfirst root (with the smallest absolute value of a), corresponding to the slowest decay of the\ncorrelation function is shown in Fig. 3. The values of \u03ba(\u03be) predicted with the use of Eq. (38)\nare in good agreement with the decay of the amplitude of H(x) determined by the iterative\nsolution of integral equation (19). Plotting the absolute value of H(x) on a logarithmic plot,\n\u2032\n\nand fitting it by the single mode \u03b1e\u03ba x , we obtain values of \u03ba\u2032 which are slightly below those\nobtained by solving Eq. (38). For example, for \u03be = 0.3 we get \u03ba\u2032 \u2248 \u22122.1 (cf. Fig. 4), whereas\nthe corresponding value of \u03ba for that surface fraction is \u03ba \u2248 \u22122.02. Similarly, for \u03be = 0.55\nwe get respectively \u03ba\u2032 \u2248 \u22120.8 and \u03ba \u2248 \u22120.7. The fact that the values of \u03ba\u2032 remain slightly\nbelow those of \u03ba can be understood by noting that \u03ba corresponds to the slowest decaying\nmode, whereas in the numerical data on H(x) we also see nonzero contributions from other,\nfaster decaying modes.\nAn interesting feature of the \u03ba(\u03be) dependence presented in Fig. 3 is the fact that the\nroot becomes purely imaginary at A = A\u2217 \u2248 15.1. This point can be made more precise\nby analyzing when the equation (38) acquires a purely imaginary solution \u03ba = ib.

We\nhave studied this question numerically. Accurate estimation of the precise value of \u03be \u2217 corresponding to A\u2217 is difficult because as we approach \u03be \u2217 the iteration procedure demands an\nincreasingly larger number of iterations to converge to a solution with the required accuracy.

In this way, we obtain\nthe estimate of \u03be \u2217 \u2248 0.622.\nLet us close this section with a comment on the ring approximation. In order to find the\nasymptotic behavior of correlations satisfying equation (28) it is sufficient to consider the\nlinearized version of equation (35). But this is equivalent to the replacement of the factor\nA = 2\u03c0n\u03c3 2 [1 + H(1)] by 2\u03c0n\u03c3 2 = 8\u03be.

When x > 2, we find\nH \u2032 (x) = n\u03c3[H(x \u2212 1) \u2212 H(x)][H(1) + 1]\n\n(48)\n\nApplying the same method as that used for hard disks we look for exponential modes exp(\u03bax)\nsolving (48). The complex frequency \u03ba satisfies the equation\n\u03ba = n\u03c3[H(1) + 1](e\u2212\u03ba \u2212 1) = \u03b6(e\u2212\u03ba \u2212 1)\n\n(49)\n\nIt turns out that all solutions of equation (49) can be expressed in terms of the multivalued\nLambert W function. Indeed, the special function W (z) is defined on the complex plane by\nthe equation\nz = W (z) exp[W (z)]\n\n(50)\n\n(\u03ba + \u03b6) exp(\u03ba + \u03b6) = \u03b6 exp \u03b6\n\n(51)\n\nBut (49) can be rewritten as\n\n15\n\n\f\u039a\n0\n\nns\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u00022\n\n\u00024\n\n\u00026\n\n\u00028\nFIG. 6. The real part of \u03bam = \u2212\u03b6 + Wm (\u03b6 exp \u03b6), m=1,. . . ,5 (top to bottom) as a function of\nn\u03c3 = \u03b6/(1 + \u03b6).\n\nIt follows that\n\u03ba = \u2212\u03b6 + W (\u03b6 exp \u03b6)\n\n(52)\n\nThe principal branch of Lambert function, W0 (z), obeys W0 (xex ) = x for real x, thus \u03ba = 0\nfor that branch. However, other branches, Wm (z) with m > 0, give values of \u03bam with a\nnegative real part, corresponding to the decay of the the correlation function. The first five\nsolutions, \u03bam (\u03b6), m = 1, . . . , 5, are presented in Fig. 6 as functions of n\u03c3 = \u03b6/(1 + \u03b6) (modes\nwith larger m decay faster).\nThe negative real part of \u03bam , m > 0 is different from zero for any accessible density, and\nvanishes only at close packing where n\u03c3 = 1. There are thus no purely imaginary solutions\n\u03ba = ib of equation (49). This confirms the correctness of the method, showing the absence\nof any structural transition in one dimension over the whole range of densities below close\npacking.\nAs illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8, the correlation function H(x) rapidly approaches the\nasymptotic form given by the slowest decaying mode, Ae\u03ba1 x . Note that not only the exponential decay rate but also the oscillation period of the function agree with that given\nby Ae\u03ba1 x starting from x \u2248 3\u03c3.

For a system of hard disks, the\nfirst numerical evidence was provided by Alder and coworkers21,22 . The data reported in\nRef. 21 showed that the hard disk freezing transition occurred at a density smaller than\n\u221a\nthe density of closest packing [corresponding to an area fraction of \u03be0 = \u03c0/ 12 = 0.90690],\nand suggested that the liquid to solid transition was first order. The most recent Monte\nCarlo simulations (on a system of 4 * 106 disks) of Mak16 suggest that melting consists of\na continuous transition from the ordered solid to an intermediate (hexatic) phase23\u201327 at a\n\npacking fraction \u03b7 = 0.723, and either a very weak first-order or a continuous transition\nfrom the intermediate phase to the fluid phase at a packing fraction \u03b7 = 0.699.\nFrom the analysis and numerical evidence presented in Section 4.B, we have calculated\nthe area fraction \u03be at which a structural change in the hard disk fluid can take place, viz.,\n17\n\n\fH\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n10-4\n10-5\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nx\n\nFIG. 8. The absolute value of H(x) \u2212 1 for hard rod fluid (solid) at n\u03c3 = 0.8 and the exponential\nasymptote H(x) = AeRe(\u03ba)x\n\n\u03be \u2217 \u223c 0.622. Converting this area fraction to a packing fraction gives \u03b7 \u2217 = \u03be \u2217 /\u03be0 \u223c 0.718.\nWhen compared to the estimate reported by Mak for the transition from the ordered solid\nphase to a dense fluid phase, \u03b7 \u223c 0.723, one finds the two values are in substantial agreement.\nAlso of interest is our prediction of a structural transition in a system of hard spheres. As\nnoted in Section 4.C, Kirkwood, Maum and Alder6 found that for values of \u03bb \u2265 34.8, no\nsolutions of the YBG and Kirkwood integral equations exist for which, in their notation,\nx2 [g(x) \u2212 1] is integrable. We find that the value of \u03bb beyond which exponential damping\nbecomes impossible is \u03bb = 34.81. Hence, the results for hard spheres appear to be in exact\nagreement. When we consider a system of hard rods, the analytic method developed here\nconfirms the absence of any structural transition in d=1 for the entire range of densities\nbelow close packing (a result which was already known to Rayleigh28 and Korteweg29 ).\nOur prediction of a structural phase transition is based on the analysis of an integral\nequation whose derivation assumed sufficiently fast decay of correlations. If a phase becomes\nordered and correlations do not decay, the integral equation to which our method was applied\ndoes not hold. This can preclude the possibility of studying a region where a new equilibrium\nphase may be formed. In particular, the identification of a region intermediate between\nmelting and freezing (see following paragraph) and the characterization of an ordered (solid)\n18\n\n\fphase is certainly beyond the scope of our approach. To study these questions within the\nKirkwood superposition approximation, one must go back to the original YBG hierarchy\nequation (Kirkwood's closure does not assume the rapid decay of correlations).\nTo develop this point further, there are three structural aspects of the hard disk transition\nthat are not captured by the method developed in this paper. First, we find no evidence for\nthe existence of an intermediate, or hexatic, phase predicted by the Kosterlitz, Thouless,\nHalperin, Nelson and Young (KTHNY) theory of d=2 melting23\u201327 , and supported by Mak's\nMonte Carlo simulations. Second, we find no evidence for the development of a shoulder on\nthe second maximum of disk radial distribution function in the vicinity of the freezing transition (\u03b7 = 0.686), reported by Truskett et al.30 based on molecular dynamics simulations,\nand later correlated with structural rearrangements occurring at increasing disk density31\u201334 .\nThirdly, we cannot confirm the existence of regions of five-fold coordination in the dense\nfluid phase, first predicted by Bernal35\u201337 based on his ball and spoke model of a random\nassembly of hard-core particles, although it has been conjectured that the hexatic phase\nmight be correlated with randomly dispersed regions of 5-, 6-, and 7-member disk clusters\nforming percolated tessellations that span the d=2 space38 .\nThe larger point, however, relates to the original Kirkwood prediction, viz. that a system\nof particles interacting via purely repulsive forces, here hard disks but also hard spheres,\ncan undergo a phase transition. Although not widely accepted at first, following the work\nof Onsager on the isotropic-nematic transition in a d=3 dimensional system of thin hard\nrods39 , there developed a gradual realization that a phase transition can be entropy driven.\nAs elaborated by Frenkel40 , in hard-core systems the entropy in the ordered phase is actually\nlarger than the fluid phase; quoting directly, \"the entropy decreases because the density is no\nlonger uniform in orientation or position, but the entropy increases because the free-volume\nper particle is larger in the ordered than in the disordered phase.\" The present contribution\nprovides further evidence for the essential correctness of Kirkwood's insight.\n\nAppendix A: Derivation of Eq.(5) from the BBGKY hierarchy\nConsider a gas of hard disks of mass m and diameter \u03c3. We denote by j \u2261 (rj , vj ),\nj = 1, 2, ... the one-particle state in which a disk has position rj and velocity vj .
