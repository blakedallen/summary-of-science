It is thus of utmost theoretical importance to understand how one can\ngo from a one dimensional situation to a more conventional high (typically three) dimensional one by coupling\none dimensional systems, allowing particles to jump from\nchain to chain. This question is far from being elucidated\ndespite several theoretical attempts4,5,6,7,8,9 . For commensurate one dimensional system another phenomenon\nappears: such systems are Mott insulators. This leads to\na direct competition between interactions and hopping.\nThe insulating behavior of the one dimensional system\ntends to kill the interchain hopping and thus to confine\nthe electrons on individual chains. Conversely, a large\ninterchain hopping destroys the one-dimensional character and thus weakens the Mott transition considerably,\nturning the system into a metal. This competition between the Mott transition and interchain hopping has in\naddition to its theoretical importance, implications for\norganic compounds10,11,12,13 that are three dimensional\nstacks of quarter filled chains14 .\nUnfortunately studying an infinite number of coupled\nchains is extremely difficult, so to understand such phenomenon it is interesting to investigate simpler systems\nwith a finite number of coupled chains. Such systems are\nthe so-called ladders15 . They present the advantage to\nallow a careful study of the effects of hopping by being\ntractable by powerful analytical16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23 and\nnumerical techniques24,25,26,27,28 . For commensurate ladders with spin, the relevance of interchain hopping was\nstudied by renormalization group techniques29,30,31 . Depending on the ratio between the single chain Mott gap\nand the interchain hopping (suitably renormalized by the\ninteractions) a very different flow of the single particle\nhopping was observed, reminiscent of the confinementdeconfinement transition expected for the infinite number\n\nof chains, even if in the ladder there is no real transition\nbut a simple crossover32. In addition, interchain hopping\nwas shown to drastically modify the critical properties of\nthe Mott transition33,34,35 compared to the one of a single\nchain. Despite these studies on commensurate ladders a\ndetailed description of the phase diagram and of the nature of the Mott transition is still lacking.\nIn the present paper we investigate these issues on a\nladder of spinless fermions. Spinless fermions exhibit extremely interesting behavior since a single chain needs\na finite repulsive interaction before turning into a Mott\ninsulator, contrarily to the spinful chain for which any\nrepulsive interaction freezes the charge leaving only the\nspin degrees of freedom. One could thus naively think to\nbe able to go from an insulating phase, dominated by the\nsingle chain gap, to a metallic phase even for repulsive\ninteractions. In fact, quite interestingly, for the spinless\nladder the Mott transition is pushed in the vicinity of\nthe non-interacting point, invalidating this naive picture.\nQuite fortunately the fact that the Mott transition is now\nin the vicinity of the non interacting point allows to study\nit using standard renormalization group technique, and\nextract the complete properties of the transition.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section II we\nintroduce the model for the two leg spinless ladder. In\nsection III we study this model using the renormalization group technique. We show that the Mott transition\noccurs now for arbitrary repulsive interactions and compute the various physical parameters (charge gap, Luttinger liquid parameters) both analytically and by a numerical integration of the RG equations. We analyse the\nphase diagram in section IV. We show that in the ladder the confinement-deconfinement is in fact a crossover.\nWe also investigate the properties of the slightly doped\nladder and point out the differences that exist compared\nto a doped single chain. Conclusions can be found in\nsection V. Finally some technical details can be found in\nthe appendix.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe start from spinless electrons on a two leg ladder,\ndescribed by the Hamiltonian\nX\nX \u2020\nni,\u03b1 ni+1,\u03b1\n(ci,\u03b1 ci+1,\u03b1 + h.c.) + V\nH = \u2212t\ni,\u03b1\n\ni,\u03b1\n\n\u2212t\u22a5\n\nX\n\n(c\u2020i,1 ci,2\n\n+ h.c.)\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, 2 is the chain index. t and t\u22a5 are respectively the intra and interchain hopping, and V the repulsion between nearest neighbors particles.\nTo analyze the long distance properties of this model it\nis convenient to use the boson representation of fermions\noperators1,2,3 , valid in one dimension. Two basis are possible: (i) one can start in the original chain basis and\nbosonize each chain; (ii) one can use the bonding and\nantibonding basis. Each basis has advantages and drawbacks and we will need both to tackle the Mott transition\nin the ladder, so we give both boson representations below.\nA\n\nChain basis\n\nWe refer the reader to the literature for the boson mapping and recall here only the main steps to fix the notations. Taking a linearized energy dispersion at the Fermi\nlevel, we use the following expressions for right and left\nmoving fermions1 .\n\u03b7R,L \u2212i(\u00b1\u03c6\u2212\u03b8) \u00b1ikF x\n\u03a8R,L = \u221a\ne\ne\n2\u03c0a\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c6 and \u03a0 are canonically conjugate operators and \u03a0 =\n1\n\u03c0 \u2202x \u03b8. \u2207\u03c6 and \u2207\u03b8 give respectively the long wavelength\nfluctuations of the density and current. We note \u03b7R,L\nKlein factors which one must introduce to reproduce the\nanticommutation properties of several fermion species8 .\na is a short distance cutoff of the order of the lattice spacing. With these operators the single chain Hamiltonian\ntakes the form:\nH = H0 + Hint + Hu\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\nvF\nH0 =\ndx (\u03c0\u03a0)2 + (\u2202x \u03c6)2\n2\u03c0\nZ\nHint = g dx(\u2202x \u03c6)2\nZ\ndx\nHu = \u22122gu\ncos(4\u03c6)\n(2\u03c0a)2\n\n(3)\n\nThe parameters of the Hamiltonian are the renormalized\nfermi velocity u, the Luttinger K parameter and the nonuniversal umklapp coupling constant. For small V these\nparameters can be perturbatively computed:\nuK = vF\nu\n2\n= vF + aV (1 \u2212 cos(2kF a))\nK\n\u03c0\ngu = aV\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\n(7)\n\nHowever the description (3) is much more general and is\nvalid even at large coupling provided the proper renormalized coupling constant are used. In fact in the following we will not assume such relations for the coupling\nconstants and take gu as a free parameter (the parameters may be tuned at will with for example a second\nnearest-neighbor interaction).\nUsing the bosonized expression (3) for the single chain,\nwe can write the two uncoupled chains in (1) as\nZ\nHint = g dx((\u2202x \u03c6s )2 + (\u2202x \u03c6a )2 )\n(8)\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndx\nHu = \u22124gu\ncos( 8\u03c6a ) cos( 8\u03c6s )\n2\n(2\u03c0a)\nwhere we define\n1\n\u03c6s = \u221a (\u03c61 + \u03c62 )\n2\n1\n\u03c6a = \u221a (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )\n2\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nThe interchain hopping in (1) reads in this basis\n\u2212 t\u22a5\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\ncos 2\u03c6a cos 2\u03b8a\n\u03c0a\n\n(11)\n\nThis basis has the advantage to treat very simply the\numklapp term, but has the drawback not to reproduce\neasily the band picture of free fermions.\n\nB\n\nwhere vF and g are respectively the bare Fermi velocity\nand the interaction. They are given by\nvF = 2ta sin(kF a)\n(1 \u2212 cos(2kF a))aV\ng=\n\u03c02\n\nThe umklapp part, Hu , only appears in this form at halffilling10 (i.e. when 4kF a = 2\u03c0) and is responsible for the\nMott transition of a single chain. The interaction g can\nbe absorbed in the quadratic part to give the Luttinger\nHamiltonian\nZ\ni\nh\nu\n1\n(6)\ndx uK(\u03c0\u03a0)2 + (\u2202x \u03c6)2\nH=\n2\u03c0\nK\n\nTwo band basis\n\nAnother basis is the bonding-antibonding band basis.\nWe first diagonalize the kinetic energy in (1) with\n1\nci,0 = \u221a (ci,1 + ci,2 )\n2\n1\nci,\u03c0 = \u221a (ci,1 \u2212 ci,2 )\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\n\f3\nand the corresponding boson fields. In this basis the\ninterchain hopping is diagonal:\nX \u2020\n(ci,0 ci,0 \u2212 c\u2020i,\u03c0 ci,\u03c0 )\n(14)\n\u2212 t\u22a5\ni\n\nhowever the interaction term is less simple to formulate.\nRather than to use the bonding and antibonding boson\nfields it is again convenient to introduce the symmetric\nand antisymmetric\ncombination that\n\u221a\n\u221a we denote now \u03c6\u03c1 =\n(\u03c60 +\u03c6\u03c0 )/ 2 and \u03c6\u03c3 = (\u03c60 \u2212\u03c6\u03c0 )/ 2 to distinguish them\nfrom the ones in the chain basis. This leads to the simple\nbosonized expression:\n\u221a Z\nt\u22a5 2\n\u2212\ndx\u2202x \u03c6\u03c3\n(15)\n\u03c0\nThe change of basis for the interaction term can be most\neasily performed using the transformation formulas for\nthe total charge current .\n\u2212 1/\u03c0\u2202x \u03c6s = \u22121/\u03c0\u2202x\u03c6\u03c1\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\ncos 2\u03c6\u03c3 cos 2\u03b8\u03c3\n\u22121/\u03c0\u2202x \u03c6a =\n\u03c0a\n\n(16)\n\nSince the interaction terms are quadratic in currents\nwe also need an operator product expansion to extract\nthe most relevant operators.\ncos n\u03c62 =\n\n1\nn2 a2\n(1 \u2212\n(\u2202x \u03c6)2 + cos 2n\u03c6)\n2\n2\n\nIII.\n\nLet us now analyse the Mott transition. The single\nchain needs a finite strength interaction in order to become an insulator. Indeed, as can be seen from (3), for a\nsingle chain the umklapp term has a dimension 2 \u2212 4K.\nIt thus opens a gap in the charge sector and leads to a\nMott insulating phase for K < 1/2 and a metallic (Luttinger liquid) phase for K > 1/2. For the t-V model this\ncorresponds to V = 2t. In the ladder the presence of interchain hopping dramatically modifies this. As we will\nshow, the ladder is an insulator for infinitesimal repulsive\ninteractions. This can be easily seen by looking in the\nchain basis at the operators generated\n\u221a\n\u221a by t\u22a5 . Obviously\nt\u22a5 will generate terms such as cos( 8\u03c6a ) and cos( 8\u03b8a ).\nNote that these terms only contain the antisymmetric\nfield.\u221aHowever when combined\u221a\nwith the umklapp (8) the\ncos( 8\u03c6a ) will generate a cos( 8\u03c6s ). This term has the\ndimension 2 \u2212 2Ks , and in contrast with the single chain\numklapp, is relevant for Ks < 1 leading to a gap in the\nsymmetric sector and hence to a Mott insulating phase.\nThe perpendicular hopping thus reinforces the insulating\ncharacter of the system.\nTo go beyond this simple argument let us now investigate the full RG flow using a two scale analysis of the\nrelevant operators in the Hamiltonian.\n\nA\n\n(17)\n\nThe expression for the anti-symmetric current is however misleading since it does not include Klein factors\nrequired to identify bosonic exponents to anticommuting\nfermions8 . To obtain the exponential terms it is necessary to read the bosonized expression on the transformed\nfour fermion operators36 .

In that case single chain umklapp operator (3) is irrelevant. The gap in this regime\nthus results from the competition of the initial decrease\nof the umklapp constant in the flow and its subsequent\ngrowth after t\u22a5 has blocked the transverse fluctuations.\nTo investigate the gap let us write the full RG equations, which include the umklapp term. Near the noninteracting point, if t\u22a5 is small the flow is given by\ndgu\ndl\ndgs\ndl\ndga\ndl\ndgf\ndl\ndKa\ndl\ndKs\ndl\ndt\u22a5\ndl\n\n= (2 \u2212 2Ka \u2212 2Ks )gu\n= (2 \u2212 2Ks )gs +\n\n1\ngu ga\n\u03c0\n\n= (2 \u2212 2Ka )ga + \u03c0(K \u22121 \u2212 K)(t\u22a5 a)2 +\n\n1\ngu gs\n\u03c0\n\n= (2 \u2212 2/Ka )gf + \u03c0(K \u22121 \u2212 K)(t\u22a5 a)2\n1\n(g 2 \u2212 ga2 \u2212 2gu2 )\n2\u03c0 2 f\n\u22121 2\n(g + 2gu2 )\n=\n2\u03c0 2 s\n1\n= (2 \u2212 (Ka + 1/Ka ))t\u22a5\n2\n=\n\n(21)\n\nwhere we have set g/u \u2192 g (u = 1) to keep the notations simple. For gu = 0 these equations reduce to the\n\n\f4\nones obtained in Ref. 17. We have introduced couplings\nwhich are generated during the flow, though they are not\npresent in the bare hamiltonian:\nZ\nZ\n\u221a\n\u221a\ndx\ndx\ncos 8\u03c6a \u2212 2gf\ncos 8\u03b8a\n\u03b4H = 2ga\n2\n2\n(2\u03c0a)\n(2\u03c0a)\nZ\n\u221a\ndx\n+2gs\ncos 8\u03c6s\n(22)\n(2\u03c0a)2\nThese new couplings are ga which is a density-density\ninteraction between the two chains and gs which is the\numklapp part of this interaction. The coupling gf transfers a pair of fermion from one chain to the other and\ncorresponds to a Josephson coupling between the two\nchains.\nFor a finite value of the renormalised t\u22a5 that depends\non the initial fermi velocity and interactions, one can neglect the interaction terms that couple the two bands in a\nnon-resonant way. Hence we can use the above flow equations up to a lengthscale l1 where t\u22a5 reaches this finite\nvalue, t\u22a5 \u223c O(1). Above the scale l1 , it is more convenient to switch to the two band basis in order to study\nthe flow. By\u221adefinition of l1 we discard any term that\ncontains cos 8\u03c6\u03c3 , since such terms transfer momentum\namong the bands. Above l1 the flow becomes\ndK\u03c3\n1\n1\n(g\u03c32 + gu2 )\n=\n2\ndl\n2\u03c0\n2\ndg\u03c3\n\u22121\n= (2 \u2212 2K\u03c3 )g\u03c3\ndl\n\n(23)\n\ndgu\n= (2 \u2212 2K\u03c1 \u2212 2K\u03c3\u22121 )gu\ndl\n\u221a\nIn the \u03c3\u2212sector the remaining cos 8\u03b8\u03c3 term opens a\ngap.\u221a We note l\u03c3 the scale when the coupling term\ncos 8\u03b8\u03c3 has flowed to a value of order one, and the\ngap amplitude is evaluated as \u2206\u03c3 = te\u2212l\u03c3 . Above the\nscale l\u03c3 the umklapp operator\n\u221a becomes relevant since it\nis reduced to a simple cos 8\u03c6\u03c1 .\ndgu\n= (2 \u2212 2K\u03c1 )gu\ndl\n\n(24)\n\nThese equations describe completely the Mott transition\nin the ladder system. An analytical solution can be given\nboth in the limit of very small interchain hopping and for\nlarge interachain hopping but in the limit of very small\ninteractions. A numerical integration of the equations\nallows to obtain the gap for arbitrary initial parameters.\n1\n\nt\u22a5 \u2192 0\n\nSince the umklapp is irrelevant for a single chain, one\ncan replace the flow, when t\u22a5 is the smallest scale in the\nproblem, by\ndgu\n= (2 \u2212 4K \u2217 )gu\ndl\ndt\u22a5\n1\n= (2 \u2212 (K \u2217 + 1/K \u2217))t\u22a5\ndl\n2\n\nwhere K \u2217 is the renormalized Luttinger parameter for a\nsingle chain. For the t \u2212 V model K \u2217 can be obtained\nexactly37,38 . When t\u22a5 \u223c O(1) we switch to the second\nset of flow equations (23). We do not know the precise\nrenormalization of the umklapp constant between l1 and\nl\u03c3 . But since l\u03c3 \u2212 l1 does not depend on t\u22a5 , this gives\na simple multiplicative constant. Above l\u03c3 we use (24).\nIntegration of the RG equations yields:\ngu (l1 ) = gu (0)e(2\u22124K\n\n\u2217\n\n)l1\n\ngu (l\u03c3 ) = gu (l1 )e\u03b2(l\u03c3 \u2212l1 )\ngu (l\u03c1 ) = gu (l\u03c3 )e(2\u22122K\n\n\u2217\n\n)(l\u03c1 \u2212l\u03c3 )\n\n(26)\n\nWe have used \u03b2 as a constant that takes into account the\nvariation of K\u03c3 between l1 and l\u03c3 as it flows to zero. This\ndoes not change the t\u22a5 dependence. Collecting the intermediate results, we can give an asymptotic dependence\nof the total charge gap on t\u22a5 :\nK\u2217\n1\n1\u2212K \u2217 2\u2212 1 (K \u2217 +1/K \u2217 )\n2\n\n\u2206\u03c1 \u221d t\u22a5\n\n(27)\n\nWhile deriving this result we have neglected terms generated to second order by t\u22a5 , such as ga ,gf and gs . In\nthe appendix A we show that including those terms do\nnot affect the dependence of \u2206\u03c1 on t\u22a5 .\n2\n\nV \u2192 0, large t\u22a5\n\nAnother interesting limit is when t\u22a5 is comparable to t.\nNote that we always remain in the limit where t\u22a5 < t in\norder to keep four points at the Fermi level, otherwise the\nproblem would be the trivial one of a single filled band\nof fermions. In that case the initial flow does not exist\nand we start directly with (23). The umklapp operator\nhas an initial dimension of 2 \u2212 4K and thus initially decreases\u221ain the flow. However combined with the operator\ng\u03c3 cos 8\u03b8\u03c3 it generates from second order\n\u221a in the interaction expansion a term of the form g\u03c1 cos 8\u03c6\u03c1 . This new\noperator is relevant, its scaling dimension being 2 \u2212 2K\u03c1 .\nThe flow equation of this operator reads:\ndg\u03c1\n1\n= (2 \u2212 2K\u03c1 )g\u03c1 +\ngu g\u03c3\ndl\n2\u03c0\n\n(28)\n\nUsing the flow equations at large t\u22a5 (23), we have\ngu (l) \u2248 V e\u2212(2\u2212V )l and g\u03c3 (l) = V + O(V 2 l2 ) , these expressions are valid at the beginning of the flow and we\nhave taken into account only the leading dependence on\nV. This leads to an approximate expression for g\u03c1 , using\nthe fact that for small interactions 2 \u2212 2K\u03c1 \u221d V :\ng\u03c1 (l) =\n\nV 2 2V l\n(e t\u03c0 \u2212 e\u22122l )\n2\n\n(29)\n\nThe coupling g\u03c1 starts at zero and is driven by gu which\nis decreasing rapidly. We may now determine the scale\nl\u2217 where g\u03c1 becomes larger than gu . Using (29) one gets:\n(25)\n\n\u2217\nV 2 V l\u2217\ne\n= V e\u2212(2\u2212V )l\n2\n\n(30)\n\n\f5\n\n1\n\nt\u22a5\n\nK=0.6\nt\u22a5/t=0.1\n\nt\u22a5\ninsulator\n\nK\n\nt\u22a5\u21920\n\nV\u21920\n\n0.5\n\nmetal\n\n\u22061ch> t\u22a5\n\n1\n\ngu /\u03c0u\n\nK*\n0\n\nwhich yields l\u2217 \u221d ln V1 . We note that at this scale g\u03c3\nhas hardly changed at all, which validates the expression\nfor g\u03c1 . Indeed g\u03c3 reaches a value of order one at l\u03c3 \u221d V1\nwhich for asymptotically small interactions is much larger\nthan l\u2217 . The charge gap is dominated by g\u03c1 and we may\nsafely drop the original umklapp operator which gives\nonly subdominant contributions. The gap in the total\ncharge sector is given by the scale where g\u03c1 reaches a\nvalue of order one.

To go beyond the asymptotics either\nat small t\u22a5 or at the transition V \u2192 0, one needs to\nnumerically integrate the flow (21,23,24). One example\nof such a flow is shown on Figure 2.

For K < 1/2 and small\nt\u22a5 , t\u22a5 renormalizes to zero as was shown in section III B,\nwhereas for large t\u22a5 (or for 1/2 < K < 1 where the single\nchain gap is absent) t\u22a5 renormalizes to large values. One\nthus seems to have a confinement-deconfinement transition, similar to the one expected for an infinite number\nof chains, induced by the competition between t\u22a5 and\nthe single chain Mott gap \u22061ch .

For small t\u22a5 the model is conveniently studied in\nthe chain basis, using the flow (21). Because the field \u03c61,2\norders, the single particle hopping between the chains is\nirrelevant (for small t\u22a5 ). The only remaining relevant\ncoupling is thus the generated interchain density-density\ninteraction ga . This coupling opens a gap in the antisymmetric sector and orders \u03c6a . The physics is quite clear:\nin the absence of interchain coupling each chain has a\ncharge density wave ground state that is double degenerate. In the presence of t\u22a5 , particles still cannot hop from\nchain to chain because of the Mott gap in each chain,\nbut the virtual hops tend to lock the two CDW relative\nto each other. This is shown on Figure 4. The Mott gap\nis thus essentially here the single chain gap. The gap as\na function of K obtained by numerical integration of the\nflow is shown in Figure 5.\nIV.\n\n\u2206\u03c1 /t\n\nFIG. 4: Degenerate ground states for two uncoupled\nchains, (a) and (b).

For K < 1/2 the Mott gap is essentially\nthe single chain gap, whereas it is strongly t\u22a5 dependent\nfor 1/2 < K < 1.\nwhere teff\n\u22a5 is the renormalized interchain hopping. We\nthus have to determine here whether we have two different insulating phases. This can be done by looking\nat the fields that order in each case. In the \"confined\"\nphase we showed in section III B that both \u03c6s and \u03c6a\nacquire mean values. In the \"deconfined\" phase, as was\nshown in section III A, \u03b8\u03c3 and \u03c6\u03c1 orders. The physical\nobservable corresponding to an out of phase charge density wave takes the following form with the two different\nset of boson operators:\nz\nJ2k\n= \u03c81\u2020 \u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82\u2020 \u03c82\n(33)\nf\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22122\n=\nsin 2\u03c6s sin 2\u03c6a\n\u03c0a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22122\n=\nsin 2\u03c6\u03c1 sin 2\u03b8\u03c3\n\u03c0a\nIt is\u221a easy to see from\n(33) that the conditions\n\u221a\n8\u03c6\u03c1 i = \u22121 on the one hand and\nhcos \u221a8\u03b8\u03c3 i = \u22121, hcos \u221a\nhcos 8\u03c6a i = \u22121, hcos 8\u03c6s i = \u22121 on the other both\nz\ngive a non zero value to hJ2k\ni. Thus the two \"phases\"\nf\nhave the same ordered fields (written in a different basis) and there is no transition but a simple crossover.\nThe out of phase charge density waves ground state that\narises naturally from the K < 1/2 picture and is shown\nin Figure 4 stays valid even in the other limit.\n\n\f7\nTABLE I: Luttinger liquid parameters at the Mott\ntransition, when varying the strength of the interaction\n(Mott-U) and when varying the doping (Mott-\u03b4).\nParameter\n\u2217\nKMott\u2212U\n\u2217\nKMott\u2212\u03b4\n\n1chain\n1/2\n1/4\n\nB\n\nLadder\n1\n1/2\n\nDoped ladder\n\nLet us now determine the phase diagram of the ladder\nsystem away from half filling.

The dashed line shows the metal-insulator\n(commensurate-incommensurate) transition for a single\nchain (beginning at finite interaction V = 2t), the continuous line corresponds to the spinless fermionic ladder.\nK \u2217 is the universal value of the luttinger liquid parameter\nat the transition.\n\n(36)\n\nfor the single chain. Using the known generic solution\nof such Mott systems10 we can see that in the ladder\nthe doping will destroy the Mott phase when \u03bc = \u2206.\nThe properties at the transition are the generic properties of the Mott transition in one dimension when varying\nthe doping (Mott-\u03b4), namely: (i) a dynamical exponent\nz = 2; (ii) a divergent compressibility on the metallic\nside. The luttinger liquid exponent is universal and is\nK \u2217 = 1/2. This values is quite different from the one\nof a single chain. The differences are recalled in Table I.\nThe difference in K \u2217 should be observable in numerical\ncalculations such as exact diagonalization and dmrg. It\nmight be a more clear signature of the difference between\nthe ladder and the single chain that the gap itself specially for K < 1/2.\nThese different values of K \u2217 correspond to two different kinds of elementary excitations. For the gapped single spinless chain the elementary excitations are domain\nwalls separating charge density waves with a different\nphase, the equivalent of the excitations called spinons\nin the spin\u22121/2 Heisenberg model. In a path-integral\npicture these corresponds to configurations where the\nfield \u03c6 is step-like with for instance \u03c6(\u2212\u221e, t) = 0 and\n\u03c6(+\u221e, t) = \u03c0/2. However such a configuration on one\nchain with a nearly constant configuration on the\u221asecond chain has an infinite cost when there is a cos 8\u03c6\u03c1\nterm in the model, no matter how small the coupling\nconstant. Therefore the low-energy excitations allowed\nfor two coupled chains are kinks (two domain walls confined in the same region). This behavior is reminiscent of\n\nthe double-sine-Gordon model that appears for a spontaneously dimerized frustrated spin\u22121/2 chain (nextnearest-neighbor exchange) with an infinitesimal bond\nalternation perturbation37 .\nA summary of the phase diagram is shown on Figure 6.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have investigated in this paper commensurate ladders of spinless fermions. We have shown that contrarily\nto the single chain, that needs a finite repulsion to become a Mott insulator, a two leg ladder turns insulating\nfor arbitrary small repulsion between the fermions. The\ninterchain hopping thus paradoxically reinforces the insulating behavior of the system. We have computed the\ncharge gap as a function of the Luttinger exponent K of\na single chain. For values of K for which the single chain\nsystem would be metallic (1/2 < K < 1) the charge gap\nvanishes as a power law of the interchain hopping t\u22a5 for\nsmall t\u22a5 , and faster than the standard BKT behavior,\nusually characterizing metal insulator transitions in one\ndimension, when the interactions tend to zero. The interchain hopping also affects the universal properties of the\ntransition that occur upon doping the system. Indeed for\nvery small doping the Luttinger liquid parameter takes\nthe universal value K \u2217 = 1/2 instead of K \u2217 = 1/4 for a\nsingle chain (when a Mott gap is present). This difference in Luttinger liquid parameters should be accessible\nin numerical simulations such as exact-diagonalization or\ndmrg.\n\n\f8\nGiven the fact that when a Mott gap is well established in a single chain the interchain hopping scales to\nzero, whereas it scales to large values otherwise, it was\nimportant to know whether there was a confinementdeconfinement transition. We have shown that there is\nin the spinless ladder only a crossover and that the two\nseemingly different insulating phases (large Mott gap on\na single chain and small t\u22a5 and large t\u22a5 and small (or\nzero) single chain Mott gap) are in fact of the same nature.\nThis leaves open how this cross-over should evolve for\nan increasing number of coupled chains to give back the\nconfinement-deconfinement transition expected for an infinite number of chains.\n\nRecalling that the flow between l1 and l\u03c3 does not change\nthe asymptotic dependence on t\u22a5 and that gu (l1 ) and\ng\u03c1 (l1 ) are proportional we recover by following the flow\nof the coupling g\u03c1 the behavior explained in the text.\nREFERENCES\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\u00a7\n\u2217\u2217\n1\n2\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nT.G. and P.D. would like to thank D.

Contracting ga with gu gives\u221aa contribution\nto the renormalization of the term gs cos 8\u03c6s (noticing\nthat \u03c6\u03c1 = \u03c6s , we switch to the notation g\u03c1 instead of\ngs ). This term is initially not present in the hamiltonian.\nHowever it is generated and relevant for any repulsive\ninteraction. One must thus make sure that this term does\nnot grow so fast as to open the gap before the original\numklapp term. If it were the case this would change the\nexpression for the charge gap compared to the one given\nin the text.\nTo determine the growth of this coupling, we have to\ndetermine ga (l). Naively the scaling dimension of ga is\n2 \u2212 2K, however it is generated by t2\u22a5 , term of dimension\n4 \u2212 (K + 1/K). Comparing the two rates shows that\nthe source term dominates. Integration then shows that\nga (l) \u221d t2\u22a5 (l). We may now repeat the same analysis\nfor g\u03c1 , indeed its scaling dimension is 2 \u2212 2K but it is\nactually driven by gu (l)ga (l), term of dimension 6 \u2212 5K \u2212\n1/K, dominant in the regime considered here (K > 1/2).\nConsequently one has g\u03c1 (l) \u221d gu (l)ga (l). Thus at the\nscale l1 , where t\u22a5 is of order one, one has g\u03c1 (l1 ) \u2248 gu (l1 ).\nTo complete\nthe argument\u221awe note \u221a\nthat the couplings\n\u221a\ng\u03c1 (l) cos 8\u03c6\u03c1 and gu (l) cos 8\u03c6\u03c1 cos 8\u03b8\u03c3 are above l1\nbasically the same operator. Indeed in the \u03c3\u2212sector\ng\u03c3\n\u221a\n6 0.\nhas flowed to strong coupling above l\u03c3 , hcos 8\u03b8\u03c3 i =\n\n10\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\nElectronic address: donohue@lps.u-psud.fr\nElectronic address:\ntsuchiiz@edu2.phys.nagoyau.ac.jp\nElectronic address: giam@lps.u-psud.fr\nElectronic address: e43428a@nucc.cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nH.
