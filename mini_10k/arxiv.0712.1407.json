The density of localized states in the sufficiently\nhigh and/or wide graphene barrier exhibits a number of singularities at certain values of the energy.\nSuch singularities provide quantum oscillations of both the transport (e.g., conductivity) and thermodynamic properties of graphene - when increasing the barrier height and/or width, similarly\nto the well-known Shubnikov-de-Haas (SdH) oscillations of conductivity in pure metals. However,\nhere the SdH-like oscillations are driven by an electric field instead of the usual magnetically-driven\nSdH-oscillations.\nPACS numbers: 73.22.-f,\n\nThe Shubnikov-de-Haas effect, i.e., the oscillations of\nthe magneto-resistance of metals when increasing an external magnetic field, was one of the first macroscopic\nmanifestations of the quantum-mechanical nature of matter. The key to understanding this remarkable phenomenon was pointed out by Landau and Onsager and\nit is described in many textbooks on solid state physics\n(see, e.g., Ref. 1). Namely, electrons in the conduction\nband of a metal in a strong magnetic field behave like\nsimple harmonic oscillators. The resulting energy spectrum is made up of equidistant Landau levels separated\nby the cyclotron energy. The density of electron states\nhas singularities at the Landau levels. When the magnetic field is changed, the positions of the Landau levels\nmove and pass periodically through the Fermi energy.\nAs a result, the population of electrons at the Fermi surface also oscillates and, in turn, leads to quantum oscillations of the transport and thermodynamic properties of\na metal. The quantum oscillations also manifest themselves in the thermoconductivity, magnetization, sound\nattenuation, magnetostriction, and other quantities.\nThese quantum oscillations are pronounced in conductors with a long mean free path of charge carriers.\nThis can occur in pure metals, semimetals, and narrow\nband-gap semiconductors at low temperatures, as well\nas in graphene, a one-atom-thick sheet of carbon. The\nShubnikov-de-Haas oscillations of the magneto-resistivity\nwere observed in graphene [2, 3] soon after its discovery [4]. Due to the monolayer honeycomb-lattice struc-\n\nture of graphene, its electrons obey a massless Dirac-like\nequation (see, e.g., Refs. 5, 6). This is responsible for\nthe unusual properties of graphene. In particular, the\nLandau levels in graphene are not equidistant and these\ninfluence the period of the Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations [7, 8]. Graphene has another striking property: it\nhas unusual relativistic effects which are counterintuitive\nfor electrons with speeds much slower than the speed of\nlight [9]. For example, it has been recently shown [5] that\ngraphene could be used for experimentally testing the\nso-called Klein paradox [10]. This quantum-mechanical\neffect of relativistic particles penetrating through high\nand wide potential barriers can be illustrated with massless Dirac fermions in graphene with a potential barrier\ncontrolled by an applied voltage. A high potential energy\nbarrier in graphene, as was shown in Ref. 11, can also act\nas an unusual electron lens, due to the negative refraction\nof electron waves at the edge of the barrier, in analogy\nto the negative refraction of 3D [12] and 2D [13, 14] electromagnetic waves.\nOur goal here is to show that, due to the Dirac-like\nHamiltonian of graphene with a potential energy barrier,\nquantum oscillations similar to the Shubnikov-de-Haas\neffect can be observed without an applied magnetic field.\nBelow we prove that the density of electron states in a\ngraphene sheet with a potential barrier should display\nquantum oscillations if the strength of the barrier (i.e.,\nthe product V0 D of the barrier's height V0 and width\nD) exceeds some threshold value. In these oscillations,\n\n\f2\n-V0/2\n\nV0/2\n\nElectrons in monolayer graphene obey the Dirac-like\nequation,\n\u2202\u03c8\n, \u0124 = \u2212i~ vF \u03c3 * \u2207 + V (x)\n(2)\n\u2202t\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity and \u03c3 = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y ) are Pauli\nmatrices. We seek stationary spinor solutions of the form,\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n\u03c8 = \u03c8(x) exp \u2212 Et + iqy ,\n(3)\n~\n\u0124\u03c8 = i~\n\nwith energy E and momentum ~q along the barrier. We\nfocus on the states with\n|q| > |\u01eb| \u2261 |E|/~vF .\n\n(4)\n\nV0/2\n\nx/D\n\n+\n\n+\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n|\u03c81| + |\u03c82|\n\nthe barrier strength V0 D, that can be controlled by a gate\nvoltage, plays the same role as the external magnetic field\nin the Shubnikov-de-Haas effect.\nThe quantum oscillations predicted here originate from\na new type of electron states in graphene. Contrary\nto non-relativistic quantum mechanics, where localized\nstates can only exist inside quantum wells, we find that\nthe electron states in graphene can be localized within\nthe barrier. We show that the energy E(qy ) of the localized states (versus the wave vector component qy along\nthe barrier) becomes non-monotonic if V0 D > \u03c0~vF\n(vF is the Fermi velocity). This produces singularities of the density of electron states for energies where\ndE/dqy = 0. When the magnitude and/or width of the\nbarrier changes, the locations of the singularities move\nand periodically cross the Fermi level, generating quantum oscillations of both thermodynamic and transport\nproperties, e.g., of the conductance in the y-direction\n(along the barrier).\nElectron states localized in a barrier.- The tunnelling\nof relativistic particles through a finite-width potential\nbarrier has recently been studied in Refs. 5, 15, 16. Here\nwe consider another type of electron waves that propagate strictly along the barrier and damp away from it.\nOur analysis shows that a step-like barrier (i.e., a single edge of an infinitely-wide barrier) does not support\nsuch electron waves, which would be an analog to surface electromagnetic waves (plasmon-polaritons) at the\ninterface between two different media. Therefore, even\nthough the potential barrier in graphene could act as an\nelectron lens [11], it cannot provide the perfect lensing\n(i.e., subwavelength image reconstruction) that is possible for Veselago's lens in optics [17]. However, as we\nshow in this section, the electron waves in graphene can\nbe localized inside a finite-width potential barrier.\nWe consider electron states in graphene with a potential barrier located in a single-layer graphene occupying\nthe xy-plane (see Fig. 1). For simplicity, we assume that\nthe barrier V (x) has sharp edges,\n\u001a\n0,\n|x| > D/2,\nV (x) =\n(1)\nV0 ,\n|x| < D/2.\n\ny\n\n0\n-1.0\n\n-0.5\n\nx/D\n\n0.5\n\n0\n1.0\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) (Top) Geometry of the problem.

Equating the\ndeterminant of this set to zero, we obtain a dispersion\nrelation for the localizes electron states,\ntan(qx D) = \u2212\n\nkx qx\n.\n(V/D \u2212 \u01eb)\u01eb + q 2\n\n(7)\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the behavior of the probability distribution W (x) for a localized state. Note that W (x) is an\neven function with continuous derivative W \u2032 (x), in spite\nof the fact that each one of the functions |\u03c81 |2 and |\u03c81 |2\nare not even (the chirality of the Dirac spinors) and both\nhave discontinuous derivatives at the points x = \u00b1D/2.\nNote that similar localized states can also be observed\nin a 2D electron gas when a voltage is applied to produce\na potential well. For electrons with a quadratic dispersion\nlaw, this spectrum is En = yn2 + 4Q2 \u2212 V, where E =\nmD2 E/2~2 , V = mD2 V0 /2~2 , Q = qD, m is the electron\nmass. Here yn is the nth root of the equation y tan(y) =\n\n\f3\n(V \u2212 y 2 )1/2 for even states, and y cot(y) = \u2212(V \u2212 y 2 )1/2\nfor odd states.\nThe spectrum Eq. (7) of localized states in graphene\nis shown by the solid black curves in Fig. 2, for dimensionless variables Q = qD and E = \u01ebD. This spectrum\nconsists of an infinite number of branches En (Q). Each\nof these branches starts from the lines E = \u00b1|Q| (red\nsolid straight lines in Fig. 1b) at E = V/2 \u2212 \u03c0 2 n2 /2V\nand tends asymptotically to the lines E = V \u00b1 Q (dashed\nred lines). Moreover, a particular branch of the spectrum\nstarts at the point (Q = 0, E = 0) and also tends to the\nline E = V \u2212 Q, when increasing Q.\n\nthe graphene edges were recently reported [20, 21, 22].\nContrary to these examples, the electron states studied\nhere are localized within the barrier and also these are\ntunable, i.e., the energy levels can be shifted by changing\nthe barrier strength (e.g., via tuning a gate voltage).\nDensity of localized electron states.- To calculate the\ndensity N (E) of\nPelectron states, we use the general formula N (E) = \u03b1 \u03b4(E \u2212 E\u03b1 ), where \u03b1 labels the quantum state and \u03b4(x) is Dirac's\ndelta-function.

The localized electron states exhibit two types\nof peculiarities. First, increasing E, the jumps or steps\n(each one of magnitude 2D/Lx) in N (E)/N0 occur at the\npoints E = V/2 \u2212 \u03c0 2 n2 /2V, where new branches of the\nspectrum arise or disappear. More importantly, singularities are observed when E = Enmax , where |dEn /dQ|\u22121\nin Eq. (9) diverges.\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Electron spectrum in graphene obtained for V = 1 (inset) and V = 9 (main panel). The sea\nof delocalized states (continuum spectrum) is marked by the\nlight-purple regions. The branches of the spectrum for localized states are shown by solid black curves between the\nstraight solid and dashed red lines. There are no states in the\nforbidden (white) regions.\n\nThe behavior of different branches of the spectrum\ndepends on the barrier strength V. If V < \u03c0/2, all\nbranches satisfy E < 0 (see inset in Fig. 2). Localized\nstates with positive energies appear only for V > \u03c0/2.\nWhen V increases, new branches in the spectrum with\npositive energies appear. When V is within the interval\n(n + 1/2)\u03c0 < V < (n + 3/2)\u03c0, the number of branches\nwith E > 0 is (n + 1), n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . We emphasize that each of the branches with positive energy has\na maximum Enmax at a certain wave number Q = Qmax\nn .\nNear these points, the group velocity of localized electron waves tends to zero. This effect is similar to the\nstop-light phenomenon [18] found in various media, including superconductors [19].\nNote that defect-induced localized electron states in\ngraphene and the enhancement of conductivity due to an\nincrease of the electron density of states localized near\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Dimensionless density of electron states\nN (E )/N0 in graphene with a potential barrier, for D/Lx = 0.5\nand V = 16.\n\nThe locations of the singularities shift when changing\nthe barrier strength V.

For example, the conductance\nof graphene along the barrier qualitatively mimics the\nquantum oscillations of the density of electron states.\nFigure 4 shows the quantum oscillations of the density of electron states in e-type graphene (with a positive\nFermi energy). For p-type graphene, with EF < 0, quantum oscillations of the density of states at the Fermi level\ncan also be observed, if the (now opposite-bias) applied\nvoltage forms a potential well instead of a barrier. Indeed,\nthe Dirac equation (2) is invariant with respect to the\ntransformation: E \u2192 \u2212E, V \u2192 \u2212V, x \u2192 \u2212x, y \u2192 \u2212y.\nIn conclusion, we predict an unusual type of electron\nstates in graphene localized within a potential barrier.\nFor barriers with sufficiently high magnitude and width,\nthe density of localized states has singularities. This feature of localized states can result in quantum oscillations\nof the thermodynamic and transport properties (e.g., the\nconductance along the barrier) of graphene when changing the barrier strength (e.g., by varying a gate voltage).\n\n[1] C.
