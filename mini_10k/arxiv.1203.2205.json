I NTRODUCTION\nIn magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the signal of interest \u03c1 represents the magnetization induced by resonance\nin the imaged tissues. In the standard setting, data acquired in MRI provide complete Fourier, or k-space, measurements of this signal \u03c1. Accelerating the acquisition process, or equivalently increasing the achievable resolution for\na fixed acquisition time, is of major interest for MRI applications. Recent approaches based on compressed sensing\nseek to reconstruct the signal from incomplete k-space information, hence defining an ill-posed inverse problem.\nThe ill-posed inverse problem is regularized by the introduction of sparsity priors, acknowledging the fact that many\nMRI signals are sparse in well-chosen bases; i.e., that their expansion contains only a small number of non-zero\ncoefficients. Such compressed sensing techniques have been developed for static and dynamic imaging [1]\u2013[5],\nThis work is supported in part by the Center for Biomedical Imaging (CIBM) of the Geneva and Lausanne Universities, EPFL, and the\nLeenaards and Louis-Jeantet foundations, in part by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) under grant PP00P2-123438, and also by\nthe EPFL-Merck Serono Alliance award.\nG.

Several algorithms have\nalso been proposed to reconstruct MRI signals from under-sampled k-space measurements (see, e.g., [12]\u2013[14]).\nIn the framework of compressed sensing, signals are usually measured through random matrices to ensure that\nany sparse signal can be recovered with overwhelming probability. The common approach in MRI consists in also\nexploiting the fact that the energy of MRI signals is usually concentrated at low spatial frequencies. Therefore a\nvariable density k-space random sampling where the under-sampling ratio increases at high frequencies is usually\nused [1]. This method, heuristic in nature, was shown to be very effective in enhancing the signal reconstruction\nquality when random distributions optimizing the associated point spread function are used. Other approaches that\noptimize the acquisition procedure have also been proposed: k-space sampling optimization by Bayesian inference\n[15]; random k-space convolution with Toeplitz matrices [16]\u2013[18]; encoding by projection onto random waveforms\nwith Gaussian distributions [19].\nIn the present work, we propose the use of a spread spectrum technique to accelerate single coil MRI acquisition\nin the framework of compressed sensing. We study this method, coined spread spectrum MRI or simply s2 MRI,\ntheoretically, numerically via simulations, and empirically via real acquisitions. The essence of our strategy consists\nof pre-modulating the image by a linear chirp, which results from the application of quadratic phase profiles, and then\nperforming random k-space under-sampling. Images are then reconstructed with non-linear algorithms promoting\nsignal sparsity. The enhancement of the signal reconstruction quality is linked to a decrease of coherence of the\nmeasurement system [20], [21]. In MRI, this type of modulation is known as phase scrambling. It can be obtained\nby using dedicated coils or by modifying radio frequency (RF) pulses. It has been used for various purposes, such\nas improving dynamic range [22], [23], or reducing aliasing artifacts [24], [25], but never in a compressed sensing\nperspective.\nLet us acknowledge that this spread spectrum technique was initially introduced by some of the authors for\ncompressive sampling of pulse trains in [26]. Its transfer to a setting encompassing analog signals and modulations\nwas studied in the context of radio interferometry [21], [27], [28]. The effectiveness of the method for MRI was\nbriefly discussed in [29]\u2013[31].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we explain the principle of the spread spectrum technique\nin a simplified analog setting. In Section III, we formulate the inverse problem for image reconstruction from\nunder-sampled k-space measurements in the presence of chirp modulation and compare the s2 MRI technique to the\nvariable density sampling method on the basis of numerical simulations of MR acquisitions of a brain image. In\nSection IV, we describe our implementation of the chirp modulation (on a 7T scanner) and show the effectiveness\nof s2 MRI using numerical simulations in this precise setting and real acquisitions of phantom and in vivo data.\nFinally, we conclude and discuss potential evolutions of the technique in Section V.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f3\n\nII. S PREAD SPECTRUM PRINCIPLE\nA. Compressed sensing\nThe essence of the recent theory of compressed sensing is the merging of data acquisition and compression [32]\u2013\n[39]. Beyond MRI, it is well-known that a large variety of natural signals are sparse or compressible in multi-scale\nbases, such as wavelet bases. In the compressed sensing theory, signals are usually expressed as N -dimensional\nvectors: \u03c1 \u2208 CN . By definition, a signal is sparse in some orthonormal basis \u03a8 \u2208 CN \u00d7N , called a sparsity basis,\nif its expansion contains only a small number K \u001c N of non-zero coefficients. More generally it is compressible\nif its expansion contains only a small number of significant coefficients. The decomposition of \u03c1 in \u03a8 is denoted\n\u03b1 \u2208 CN , and it satisfies\n\u03c1 = \u03a8\u03b1.\n\n(1)\n\nThe theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that a small number M \u001c N of linear and non-adaptative\nmeasurements \u03bd \u2208 CM suffices for an accurate and stable reconstruction of the signal \u03c1. These measurements may,\nfor example, be obtained by projection onto M randomly selected basis vectors of an orthonormal basis \u03a6 \u2208 CN \u00d7N ,\ncalled a sensing basis. This selection process can be modeled by a multiplication with a rectangular binary matrix\nM \u2208 RM \u00d7N that contains only one non-zero value on each line, at the index of the basis vector to be selected.\nTo model a non-perfect sensing process, these measurements are assumed to be contaminated by independent and\nidentically distributed noise n \u2208 CM . The measurement model thus satisfies\n\u03bd = \u0398\u03b1 + n, with \u0398 = M\u03a6? \u03a8 \u2208 RM \u00d7N ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the matrix \u0398 identifies the measurement matrix as seen from the sparsity basis (*? denotes the conjugate\ntranspose operation).\nTo reconstruct the signal \u03c1 from the measurements \u03bd, the compressed sensing framework proposes, among\nother approaches, to solve the Basis Pursuit (BP) minimization problem [32]\u2013[39]. This problem regularizes the\noriginally ill-posed inverse problem related to (2) with an explicit sparsity or compressibility prior on the signal.\nIn the presence of noise, the BP problem is the minimization of the `1 norm1 of \u03b1 under a constraint on the `2\nnorm2 of the residual noise n\u0304 = \u03bd \u2212 \u0398\u1fb1:\n\u03b1\u2217 = arg min ||\u1fb1||1 subject to ||\u03bd \u2212 \u0398\u1fb1||2 \u2264 \u000f.\n\u1fb1\u2208CN\n\n(3)\n\nThe corresponding reconstructed signal is \u03c1\u2217 = \u03a8\u03b1\u2217 .\nIn this setting, the compressed sensing theory shows that if the number of measurements satisfies\nM \u2265 DN K\u03bc2 (\u03a6? , \u03a8) ln4 N,\n\n(4)\n\nfor a universal constant D, then \u03b1 is recovered accurately by solving the BP problem (3) [39]. In relation (4),\n\u03bc (\u03a6? , \u03a8) is the mutual coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases.

A signal \u03c1 (top left panel) is modulated\nby a linear chirp (top right panel). In k-space, the modulation\n1\n\namounts to the convolution of the Fourier transform of the signal (middle left panel) with that of the chirp (middle right panel). The spectrum\nof the resulting signal (bottom panel) spreads out in k-space.\n\nin absolute value, between the sparsity basis vectors \u03c6i , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , and sensing bases vectors \u03c8i0 , 1 \u2264 i0 \u2264 N\n[36], [39]:\nN \u22121/2 \u2264 \u03bc (\u03a6? , \u03a8) =\n\nmax |\u03c6i * \u03c8i0 | \u2264 1.\n\n1\u2264i,i0 \u2264N\n\n(5)\n\nThe mutual coherence \u03bc (\u03a6? , \u03a8) plays a crucial role in relation (4). Indeed, the number of measurements M \u2217\nneeded to reconstruct K-sparse signals increases quadratically with its value: M \u2217 \u221d \u03bc2 (\u03a6? , \u03a8). In the worst case\nwhere \u03bc (\u03a6? , \u03a8) = 1, M \u2217 is of the order of the signal dimension N and under-sampling is impossible. However,\nwhen the mutual coherence is at its minimum, N \u22121/2 , M \u2217 is reduced to the order of the sparsity level K. This result\ncan intuitively be explained with a simple consideration on the spread of the energy of the sparsity basis vectors in\nthe measurement domain \u03a6. In an incoherent orthonormal system, the absolute value of the scalar product between\nthe sensing basis vector \u03c6i and the sparsity basis vector \u03c8i0 is small for all pairs of indices 1 \u2264 i, i0 \u2264 N . As\nk\u03a6? \u03c8i0 k2 = k\u03c8i0 k2 , the energy of the sparsity basis vector \u03c8i0 spreads equally over the sensing basis vectors \u03c6i .\nConsequently, whatever index i is selected to perform a measurement, one always gets information concerning all\nthe sparsity basis vectors describing the original signal. The number of measurements needed for accurate recovery\nthus decreases.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f5\n\nTABLE I\nVALUES OF Nc \u03bc2c AT DIFFERENT CHIRP RATES w\u0304\nNc \u03bc2c\n\nDirac\n\nHaar\n\nFourier\n\nw\u0304 = 0\n\n1.00\n\n256\n\n256\n\nw\u0304 = 0.1\n\n2.27\n\n43.5\n\n15.5\n\nw\u0304 = 0.3\n\n2.97\n\n25.9\n\n6.11\n\nw\u0304 = 0.5\n\n3.29\n\n22.4\n\n4.17\n\nB. Spread spectrum and coherence reduction\nThe above considerations suggest that to reduce to the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery of\nMRI signals, one can try to modify the MRI acquisition procedure in such a way that the energy of the sparsity basis\nvectors spreads all over the k-space. Following this idea, the s2 MRI technique introduces a linear chirp modulation\nof the signal of interest before random selection of k-space coefficients (see Fig. 1). Indeed, this modulation\nconserves the energy of the input signal and corresponds to a convolution that generically spreads the spectrum.\nTo study theoretically the proposed acquisition scheme, we consider a simplified analog setting where the onedimensional signal of interest is denoted by a complex-valued function \u03c1(x) of the position x \u2208 R. This signal is\nlimited on a finite field of view L. For the sake of simplicity of the following theoretical result only, we assume\nthat the energy of this signal beyond the spatial frequency B is negligible3 . We thus sample this signal on a discrete\nuniform grid of N = 2LB points and represent the resulting discrete signal by a vector \u03c1 \u2208 CN . The vector \u03c1 is\nassumed to be K-sparse in an orthonormal basis \u03a8 \u2208 CN \u00d7N . We also consider a one-dimensional linear chirp, with\n2\n\nchirp rate w \u2208 R, that reads as a complex-valued function c(x) = ei\u03c0wx . On the field of view L, this linear chirp is\napproximately band limited at its maximum instantaneous frequency |w|L/2. This band limit can be parametrized\nin terms of a discrete chirp rate w\u0304 = wL2 /N and thus |w|L/2 = |w\u0304|B.\nIn this setting, the s2 MRI measurement model is given by equation (2) with\n\u03a6? = F? CU \u2208 CNc \u00d7N .\n\n(6)\n\nIn the above equation, the matrix U represents an up-sampling operator needed to avoid aliasing of the modulated\nsignal due to a lack of sampling resolution in a digital description of the originally analog problem. Indeed, the\nconvolution in Fourier space induced by the analog chirp modulation implies that the band limit of the modulated\nsignal is the sum of the individual band limits of the original signal and of the chirp c. Therefore, an up-sampled\ngrid with at least Nc = (1 + |w\u0304|)N points needs to be considered and the modulated signal is correctly obtained by\napplying the chirp modulation on the signal after up-sampling on the Nc points grid. The up-sampling operator U,\nimplemented in Fourier space by zero padding, is thus of size CNc \u00d7N and satisfies U\u2217 U = I \u2208 CN \u00d7N . The matrix\nC \u2208 CNc \u00d7Nc is the diagonal matrix implementing the chirp modulation on the up-sampled grid and the matrix\n3 In\n\nsection III, we will introduce a setting that properly takes into account the fact that, in general, MRI signals are not band limited.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f6\n\n1\n\nBP0\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\nBP0.5\n\n0.8\n\nBP0.1\n\n0.8\n\nBP0.3\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nBP0.5\n\nBP0\n\n60\n\n100\n\n140\n\nM\n\n180\n\n220\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nBP0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nBP0.5\n\n0.7\n\nBP0.1\n\n0.6\n\nBP0.3\n\nBP0.1\nBP0\n\n0.1\n\n60\n\n100\n\n140\n\nM\n\n180\n\n220\n\n0\n\n60\n\n100\n\n140\n\nM\n\n180\n\n220\n\n1\n\nFig. 2.\n\nProbability of recovery of the signal \u03c1 as a function of the number of measurements M for w\u0304 = 0 (dotted black curve), w\u0304 = 0.1\n\n(continuous blue curve), w\u0304 = 0.3 (continuous red curve), w\u0304 = 0.5 (continuous black curve), and three sparsity bases: the Dirac basis (left);\nthe Haar wavelet basis (middle); the Fourier basis (right).\n\nF = {fi }1\u2264i\u2264Nc stands for the discrete Fourier basis on the same grid.\nThe s2 MRI sensing matrix \u03a6 is not orthogonal because of the presence of the matrix U.

This result shows that the number of measurements M needed to reconstruct K-sparse signals is\nproportional to the product Nc \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) rather than to \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) only. The s2 MRI technique is efficient only\nif this product decreases with the chirp rate w\u0304. In other words, the number of measurements needed for accurate\nrecovery of sparse signals decreases only for sparsity basis \u03a8 for which the mutual coherence \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) decreases\nfaster than Nc increases.\nC. Illustration\nWe illustrate here the effect of the chirp modulation on the number of measurements needed for accurate recovery\nof K-sparse signals.\nWe consider a 1-dimensional complex signal \u03c1 of size N = 256 corresponding to one line of an MRI brain\nimage. This signal is decomposed into three different sparsity bases \u03a8 and hard-thresholded at a fixed sparsity\nK = 25. The sparsity bases considered are the Dirac basis, the Haar wavelet basis and the Fourier basis. This\nsignal is then probed according to relation (2) with \u03a6? = F? CU and w\u0304 \u2208 {0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5}, and reconstructed from\ndifferent numbers of measurements M by solving the BP problem (3). Each time, the probability of recovery4 of\nthe signal is computed over 1000 simulations. In this experiment, no noise is added to the measurements y, and\nthe indices i of the selected Fourier basis vectors fi are chosen uniformly at random from {0, . . . , Nc \u2212 1}.\nThe BP reconstructions in the presence of chirp modulation with chirp rate w\u0304 are denoted by BPw\u0304. For each\nsparsity basis and chirp rate considered, the curves of the probability of recovery as a function of the number of\n4 Perfect\n\nrecovery is considered to occur if the `2 -norm between the original signal \u03c1 and the reconstructed signal \u03c1? satisfies: k\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1? k2 \u2264\n\n10\u22123 k\u03c1k2\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f7\n\nmeasurements M are reported in Fig. 2. The corresponding values of the product Nc \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) are reported in\nTable I.\nFor the Dirac basis, the number of measurements needed to reach a probability of recovery of 1 slightly increases\nwith the chirp rate, as suggested by the values of Nc \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) in Table I and relation (7). On the contrary, for\nthe Haar and Fourier bases, the values of Nc \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) in the table predict a drastic improvement of the results\nwith an increase of the chirp rate. This prediction is confirmed by the results presented in Fig. 2. Note that for the\nHaar and Fourier bases, the value of the product Nc \u03bc2c (\u03a6? , \u03a8) decreases much less between w\u0304 = 0.3 and w\u0304 = 0.5\nthan between w\u0304 = 0.1 and w\u0304 = 0.3, suggesting a smaller improvement in the number of measurements needed\nfor accurate recovery. This is also in line with the curves of the probability of recovery in Fig. 2. In summary, as\npredicted by the theory, the effect of the s2 MRI technique depends on the sparsity basis. Note that the decrease of\nthe performance for the Dirac basis (optimally incoherent only at w\u0304 = 0) is negligible compared to the improvement\nobtained for the two other bases. Note also that MRI signals are usually sparse in wavelet bases [1]. The results\nobtained with the Haar wavelet basis therefore suggest strong efficiency of the technique in MRI.\nOne can wonder if the proposed encoding scheme can result in shift-variant reconstruction quality. Indeed, the\nphase variation at the center of the chirp is less rapid than at the limit of the field of view. Let us consider the\ncase of a signal sparse in the Haar wavelet basis. This signal can, roughly, be separated in large scale and fine\nscale sparsity basis vectors. The region where the chirp is oscillating slowly is limited to a small part of the field\nof view. Consequently, large scale sparsity basis vectors are necessarily affected by the chirp modulation as they\nhave a wide support in signal space. The energy of these basis vectors is thus spread in k-space thus improving the\nreconstruction quality of the low scale structures of the signal. On the other hand, the fine scale sparsity basis vectors\nat the center of the field of view remains not significantly modulated. However, these vectors are already incoherent\nwith the Fourier basis as their energy naturally spreads out in k-space. The fine scale structure of the signal are\nwell recovered in absence and presence of chirp modulation. In summary, almost no shift-variant reconstruction\nquality is to be expected.\nLet us acknowledge that the idea of convolving the k-space to optimize the acquisition procedure in the context\nof compressed sensing can also be found in [16]\u2013[18]. In these works, the k-space is convolved by a random\nToeplitz matrices. We should also note that the spread spectrum technique can be related to the random convolution\napproach where the signal is convolved by a random sequence and under-sampled in real space [40]. In our case,\nconvolution and under-sampling occur in k-space. Finally, let us mention that in a discrete setting, i.e., in the\nabsence of band limit extension, replacing the linear chirp modulation by a random modulation leads to a universal\nencoding strategy, i.e., the reconstruction quality does not depend on the sparsity basis [20]. The s2 MRI technique\ntries to emulate this universal encoding strategy. A universal compressed sensing strategy might as well be obtained\nby projecting the signal \u03c1 onto random waveforms with Gaussian distributions [34], [35]. In the context of MRI,\nan encoding strategy based on this sensing scheme was recently proposed in [19].\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f8\n\n1\nFig. 3. Original brain image at 1 mm of resolution.

Dark and light regions respectively indicate low and high intensities.\n\nIII. S PREAD SPECTRUM MRI ( S2 MRI)\nA. Quadratic phase profiles\nThe spread spectrum principle was explained in the previous section in a simplified analog framework. Here, we\nmove to a setting encompassing realistic analog MR signals which are limited in field of view and are consequently\nnot band limited.\nStandard MR measurements take the form of k-space coefficients, with k = (kx , ky , kz ), of the original threedimensional image probed representing the tissue magnetization as a function of the position inside a given field\nof view. This image is complex-valued due to magnetic field inhomogeneities [41]. We consequently denote it\nby a complex-valued function \u03c1(x) of the position x \u2208 R3 , with components (x, y, z) in image space. (x, y)\nconventionally corresponds to the phase encoding directions, and z corresponds to the readout direction. The field\nof view is L = Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz . We also consider quadratic phase profiles represented by a linear chirp in the phase\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f9\n\nencoding directions\nc (x) = ei\u03c0(wx x\n\n2\n\n+wy y 2 )\n\n,\n\n(8)\n\nwith chirp rate (wx , wy ) \u2208 R2 . This linear chirp is characterized by an instantaneous frequency (wx x, wy y) at\nposition x. On the finite field of view L, it is therefore approximately a band-limited function with approximate\nband-limits (|wx |Lx /2, |wy |Ly /2) in the phase encoding directions.\nIn this setting, MR measurements at spatial frequency k \u2208 R3 take the general form\nZ\n\u03bd (k) =\n\u03c1 (x) c (x) e\u22122i\u03c0k*x d3 x.\n\n(9)\n\nR3\n\nIn other words, the measurement \u03bd corresponds to the coefficient at spatial frequency k of a signal obtained\nas the product of the original image \u03c1(x) with the linear chirp modulation c(x). In the absence of modulation\n(wx = wy = 0), the measurements simply reduce to standard k-space measurements. In the presence of quadratic\nphase profiles, the modulation amounts to the convolution of the Fourier transform of the chirp with that of the\noriginal image.\nB. Under-sampling in k-space and the inverse problem\nLet us assume that we want to probe the signal \u03c1 at a resolution corresponding to a band-limit B = (Bx , By , Bz ).\nNote that it does not imply that the signal is band-limited and some energy may remain beyond B. At this\nresolution, the signal of interest is discretized on a discrete uniform grid of N = Nx \u00d7 Ny \u00d7 Nz spatial frequencies\nki \u2208 R3 , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N , in k-space, with Nx = 2Lx Bx , Ny = 2Ly By , and Nz = 2Lz Bz . In real space, this\ndiscretized signal may equivalently be described by its coefficients on a discrete uniform grid of N points xi\nwith 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N . On this discrete grid, the linear chirp can be parametrized in terms of discrete chirp rates\n\u0001\n(w\u0304x , w\u0304y ) = wx L2x /Nx , wy L2y /Ny , thus exhibiting approximate band-limits (|w\u0304x |Bx , |w\u0304y |By , 0) on the finite field\nof view L.\nWe assume that the spatial frequencies probed span the k-space up to the band-limits B. We also assume that\nthese frequencies belong to the discrete grid of points ki , so that we can avoid any re-gridding operation [41]. Due\nto the linear chirp modulation, the measurements can contain significant energy from k-space coefficients beyond\nthe band-limits B. Considering the estimated band-limits of the linear chirp, we choose to reconstruct the original\nsignal \u03c1 on a high resolution grid of Nc = Nx (1 + |w\u0304x |) \u00d7 Ny (1 + |w\u0304y |) \u00d7 Nz points in order to prevent any aliasing\nin the reconstruction algorithm from these high spatial frequencies. The sampled signal on this high resolution grid\nis denoted by a vector \u03c1 \u2208 CNc . The reconstructed signal is subsequently down-sampled at the desired resolution\nby keeping only its spatial frequencies belonging to the previously defined grid of size N .\nThe k-space coverage provided by the M spatial frequencies probed kb , with 1 \u2264 b \u2264 M , can be represented by\na binary mask in k-space, equal to 1 for each spatial frequency probed and 0 otherwise. The measurements may\nbe denoted by a vector of M k-space coefficients \u03bd = {\u03bd(kb )}1\u2264b\u2264M \u2208 CM , possibly affected by noise, which\nis denoted by the vector n = {nb }1\u2264b\u2264M \u2208 CM . In this setting, we consider an incomplete k-space coverage\n(M < N ), in order to accelerate the acquisition time in comparison with a complete k-space coverage.

This form of under-sampling can directly be\nexpressed in terms of an acceleration of the acquisition. Thus, the s2 MRI measurement model satisfies\n\u03bd = MF? CU\u03c1 + n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the matrix MF? CU \u2208 CM \u00d7Nc encodes the complete linear relation between the signal and the measurements.\nThe rectangular matrix U \u2208 CNu \u00d7Nc represents an up-sampling operation, implemented in k-space space by zero\npadding. This operation is needed to avoid any aliasing of the modulated signal due to a lack of sampling resolution\nin a discrete description of the originally continuous problem. The modulated signal is correctly obtained by applying\nthe chirp modulation to the signal after up-sampling on the grid of Nu = Nx (1 + 2|w\u0304x |) \u00d7 Ny (1 + 2|w\u0304y |) \u00d7 Nz\npoints by zero padding in the kx and ky directions. The matrix C \u2208 CNu \u00d7Nu is the diagonal matrix implementing\nthe chirp modulation on the up-sampled grid. The unitary matrix F \u2208 CNu \u00d7Nu stands for the discrete Fourier basis\non this high resolution grid. The matrix M \u2208 RM \u00d7Nu is the rectangular binary matrix implementing the mask. It\ncontains only one non-zero value on each line, at the index of the k-space coefficient corresponding to each of the\nspatial frequencies probed.\nRegarding the reconstruction of the signal \u03c1, (10) represents the measurement constraint. We take a statistical point\nof view and consider independent Gaussian noise on each measurement. Considering a candidate reconstruction \u03c1\u0304,\nthe residual noise reads as n\u0304 = \u03bd \u2212 MF? CU\u03c1\u0304. The noise level estimator, defined as twice the negative logarithm\nof the likelihood associated with \u03c1\u0304, reads as\n\u03c72 (\u03c1\u0304, \u03bd) =\n\nM\nX\n|n\u0304b |2\n,\n[\u03c3 (nb ) ]2\nb=1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the symbol | * | stands for the complex norm and \u03c3 (nb ) for the standard deviation of each of the real and\nimaginary parts of the noise component nb . This noise level estimator follows a chi-square distribution with 2M\ndegrees of freedom. Typically, this estimator should be minimized by a good candidate for the reconstruction. As\nexplained in [33], the measurement constraint on the reconstruction may be defined as a bound \u03c72 (\u03c1\u0304, \u03bd) \u2264 \u000f2 , with\n\u000f2 corresponding to some large percentile of the chi-square distribution. In the remainder of the paper, we choose\nthe 99th percentile.\nC. Variable density sampling\nAs discussed in [1], the method selecting the spatial frequencies kb , with 1 \u2264 b \u2264 M , is critical to achieve\ngood reconstruction. Their approach is based on the use of a variable density sampling method. The distributions,\nwhich are empirically identified to provide optimized reconstructions, are defined by a power law decaying function\nf (k) = (1 \u2212 |k|/|km |)p + \u03b2 for some power p > 0 and real constant \u03b2 \u2208 [\u22121, 1] (|k|2 = kx2 + ky2 and km is\nthe highest spatial frequency of the k-space domain to probe). In the present work, the spatial frequencies kb are\nselected using the method5 of [1]: the values f (ki ) are first thresholded to restrict them to the interval [0, 1]; N\n5 Toolbox\n\navailable at http://www.stanford.edu/\u223cmlustig/SparseMRI.html\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f12\n\nindependent binary random variables \u03b4 (ki ) taking value 1 with probability f (ki ) are then generated; and finally\nthe mask M selecting the k-space coefficients for which \u03b4 (ki ) = 1 is created.\nLet us highlight the importance of the value \u03b2 on the actual shape of the variable density profile. For a fixed\npower p, this constant is computed beforehand in order to ensure that the number of measurements is, on average,\nequal to its target value M . Given a fixed number M of measurements, we denote pM the value of p for which\n\u03b2 = 0. For a small value of p (p < pM ), one would intuitively predict that the measurements spread all over the\nk-space domain with the density of points higher at the center of k-space. In fact, for p < pM , one has \u03b2 < 0 and\na whole k-space region at high frequency remains unprobed. On the contrary, we have \u03b2 > 0 for p > pM and the\nk-space is probed with a non-zero probability at the edges. Consequently, p = pM is the first power that ensures\nthat the entire k-space domain is probed with a non-zero probability. Also note that for p > pM , the center of the\nk-space is fully sampled, as \u03b2 > 0, and that the size of the fully sampled region increases when p increases.\nIn practice, the choice of the power p of the variable density profile is difficult and should be adapted with the\nnumber of measurements in order to obtain the best reconstruction qualities. In the absence of chirp modulation, we\nperformed reconstructions for several values of p and noticed that p = pM leads to the best performance6 . In the\npresence of a linear chirp modulation, the power spectrum of the original signal is spread and flattened. However,\nin the range of the chirp rates studied, the power spectrum of the modulated signal remains peaked at the origin\n(Fig. 3). We therefore also apply a variable density sampling and choose the power p to be pM . Empirically, this\nvalue also leads to the best reconstruction qualities. Note that choosing p = pM seems reasonable, as, given the\nspread of the information in the phase encoding directions, one wants to distribute the measurements over the entire\nsampling region of size B and also limit the size of the fully sampled region at the k-space center.\nLet us acknowledge that recent theoretical results obtained in [42] support the choice of such profiles in MRI.\nD. Numerical simulations\n1) Simulation protocol: To test the proposed technique, a real brain image is acquired on a 7T short bore, actively\nshielded, MR scanner (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The subjects provided written informed consent prior to the\nimaging session, according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee. The parameters of the acquisition are\nas follows: Lx \u00d7 Ly \u00d7 Lz = 224 \u00d7 168 \u00d7 208 mm3 with a resolution of 0.5 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 4 mm3 . The matrix size is thus\nNx \u00d7 Ny \u00d7 Nz = 448 \u00d7 336 \u00d7 52. The standard clinical MPRAGE sequence is used with echo time TE = 3.53 ms,\ninversion time TI = 1.3 s, repetition time TR = 3.5 s, and bandwidth BW = 200 Hz. Note that, for the sake of\nsimplicity, we restrict our analyses to one two-dimensional z-slice of the original three-dimensional acquisition with\nan under-sampling in both phase encoding directions kx and ky . Also note that the image used is complex-valued.\nIn order to model an analog acquisition scheme, the original image at a resolution of 0.5 mm is used to compute\nthe measurements but the reconstruction is performed at a resolution of 1 mm. The reconstructed images are\ncompared to the image obtained with a full acquisition at 1 mm of resolution (Fig. 3).\n6 In\n\npractice, pM is determined by an iterative process. Starting from p = 0, we increase its value by 0.5 until we obtain \u03b2 \u2265 0 for the\n\nnumber of measurements considered.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f13\n\nThe parameters of our analyses are as follows. Firstly, acquisitions are considered for various numbers M of\ncomplex measurements corresponding to coverages of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50 percent of N . Secondly, instrumental\nnoise is also added to the measurements as independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise. The\ncorresponding standard deviation \u03c3 is identical for all the frequencies probed and we consider values of input snr7\nof 2j , with 1 \u2264 j \u2264 6. Thirdly, the chirp modulation studied has the same chirp rate w\u0304 in both phase encoding\ndirections, i.e., w\u0304 = w\u0304x = w\u0304y , with values in the range [0, 0.5]. Fourthly, the signals are reconstructed by solving\nthe BP problem where the Total Variation (TV) norm of the signal \u03c1 is substituted for the `1 norm8 . This problem\nis solved thanks the Douglas Rachford algorithm [44], [45]. Note that the TV norm in combination with wavelet\nsparsity basis is, for example, used for reconstructing MRI signals from under-sampled k-space in [1], [6], or [14].\nFor our problem, we tested several multiscale representations such as Daubechies wavelets, steerable wavelets,\nor curvelets, but the best reconstructions were obtained with the TV norm. Finally, for each value of M and\ninput snr considered, 30 simulations are generated with independent noise and mask realizations, and the relative\nreconstruction errors k\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1? k2 /k\u03c1k2 are computed for the variable density sampling and s2 MRI techniques. For\neach value of M and input snr, the discrete chirp rate w\u0304opt that gives the smallest relative error on average over\nthe 30 simulations is recorded9 .\n2) Simulation results: The magnitudes of the reconstructed images obtained with the s2 MRI and the variable\ndensity sampling techniques for an acceleration factor of 5 and an input snr of 32 are presented in Fig. 4, along\nwith the corresponding error images (magnitudes of the complex-valued differences between the original image and\nreconstructed images). The relative errors of the reconstructions as functions of the input snr for the six coverages\nconsidered and for both methods are reported in Fig. 5.\nFor acceleration factors larger than 2, the s2 MRI technique with w\u0304 = 0.3 provides better reconstruction than the\nvariable density sampling technique with an improvement up to 0.05 of the relative error. Indeed, the relative error\nis, on average, lower in the presence of the chirp modulation. The corresponding standard deviations are also much\nsmaller, indicating that the s2 MRI technique is more stable10 . At an acceleration factor of 2, the variable density\nsampling technique gives slightly better reconstructions than the s2 MRI technique with w\u0304 = 0.3. However, with\nw\u0304 = w\u0304opt = 0.1, the s2 MRI technique provides relative errors similar to those obtained with the variable density\nsampling technique. These results suggest to reduce the chirp rate as the number of measurements increases. This\nis coherent with the fact that modulation is not needed in the limit of no under-sampling.\n7 The\n\nsnr is defined as the ratio between the mean value of the complex magnitude of the original signal and the standard deviation of the\n\nnoise \u03c3.\n8 The\n\nTV norm of a signal is defined as the `1 norm of the magnitude of its gradient [32], [43]. Note that the recovery condition (7) does\n\nnot hold with this norm. However, one can notice that the TV norm of a signal \u03c1 is very similar to the `1 norm of its decomposition in the\nHaar wavelet basis. In the light of the preliminary results of Section II-C, one can thus hope to obtain an improvement of the reconstruction\nquality in presence of chirp modulation.\n9 s MRI\n2\n\ntoolbox available at http://lts2www.epfl.ch/people/gilles.\n\n10 Some\n\nleftover variability for the variable density sampling technique might still be removed by increasing the number of simulations.\n\nHowever, this would not modify the results and comparison with s2 MRI.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f14\n\nWhen comparing the magnitudes of reconstructed images in Fig. 4, differences between both methods do not\nappear obvious. However, one can notice that fine details are recovered better with the s2 MRI technique: the vessel\n(white spot) indicated by a blue arrow appears in the s2 MRI reconstruction, but not in the variable density sampling\nreconstruction. The error images bring more information, and one can notice that the errors are smaller in the\npresence of chirp modulation. In particular, the low scale structures, rendered incoherent with the chirp modulation,\nare better recovered.\nIV. S2 MRI IMPLEMENTATION AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nA. Implementation\nThe s2 MRI technique is tested on the 7T scanner described in Section III-D with 3D acquisitions of a phantom\nand a human brain. For the brain experiment, the subjects provided written informed consent prior to the imaging\nsession, according to the guidelines of the local ethics committee.\nThe chirp modulation is implemented through the use of a second order shim coil x2 \u2212y 2 . In our implementation,\nthe chirp rate varies linearly with the readout time t (or equivalently kz ) and is proportional to the intensity of the\nquadratic magnetic field \u03ba: w(t) = wx (t) = \u2212wy (t) = \u03b3\u03bat/\u03c0, where \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic factor. The maximum\nchirp rate wmax is reached at t = TE + \u2206t/2, the mean chirp rate wmean at t = TE, and the minimum chirp rate\nwmin at t = TE \u2212 \u2206t/2 (\u2206t is the readout duration). This chirp modulation can be introduced in the measurement\nmodel by modifying (10) as follows:\n\u03bd = MF?xy CF?z U\u03c1 + n.\n\n(12)\n\nIn the above equation, F?z \u2208 CNu \u00d7Nu and F?xy \u2208 CNu \u00d7Nu implement the Fourier transform along the z-direction\nand the xy-directions, respectively. The matrix C \u2208 CNu \u00d7Nu implements the chirp modulation. Signals are thus\nreconstructed on a grid of Nc = Nx (1 + |w\u0304xmax |) \u00d7 Ny (1 + |w\u0304ymax |) \u00d7 Nz points, and Nu = Nx (1 + 2|w\u0304xmax |) \u00d7\nNy (1 + 2|w\u0304ymax |) \u00d7 Nz .\nThis modulation can be decomposed as a quadratic phase modulation in the (x, y) planes with chirp rate wmean ,\ncombined with a linear phase modulation in kz . This linear phase modulation produces shifts of the original signal\nby an amount proportional to \u03ba(x2 \u2212 y 2 ) along the z direction. The chirp modulation used is thus not ideal, as it\ncreates distortions of the original object and complicates the measurement matrix. However, the energy of sparsity\nbasis vectors is still spread by the main chirp modulation with chirp rate wmean , and the previous conclusions\nbased on theory and simulations should still hold. This will be confirmed by the numerical experiments of Section\nIV-B. Note also that the reconstructed images are free of any distortion as the complete effect of the modulation\nis modeled in (12). Let us remark that these distortions might be avoided with the use of RF pulses or dedicated\ncoils applied only during phase encoding.\nAs in Section III-D, the s2 MRI technique is compared to the variable density sampling method with p = pM .\nFull acquisitions (M/N = 1) are performed both in the absence and in the presence of the chirp modulation. The\nnumber of phase encodings (kx , ky ) is then reduced retrospectively by applying a mask on the complete data.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f15\n\n.3\n\n.3\n\n0.25\n\n25\n\n25\n\n0.2\n\n.2\n\n.2\n\n0.15\n\n15\n\n15\n\nRelative error\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n10\n\nsnr\n\n20\n\n30 .1 0\n\n10\n\nsnr\n\n20\n\n30\n\n.1\n\n0\n\n10\n\nsnr\n\n20\n\n30\n\n1\n\nFig. 6.\n\nRelative reconstruction errors as functions of the input snr for the variable density sampling technique (dashed blue curve) and the\n\ns2 MRI technique (dot-dashed red curve) with varying chirp modulation. From left to right and top to bottom, the panels show the curves for\ncoverages of 15, 25, 50 percent of N respectively. All curves represent the mean relative error over 5 simulations, and the vertical lines represent\nthe error at 1 standard deviation.\n\nThe noise level is evaluated directly on the under-sampled data available for reconstruction. For each (kx , ky )\npair measured, all the frequencies kz are probed so that the signal is available as a function of z. The level of the\nnoise is estimated on probed pairs (kx , ky ) at positions z that do not contain any signal. This noise level is identical\nin the presence and absence of chirp modulation.\nB. Numerical validation\nIn this section, we perform simulations using the acquisition scheme described above to confirm that, even though\nthe implementation of the chirp modulation is not ideal, the reconstruction quality is still enhanced with the s2 MRI\ntechnique.\nFor this numerical experiment, a brain volume was acquired using the standard clinical MPRAGE sequence on\na field of view of Lx = 243 mm, Ly = 176 mm and Lz = 256 mm, with a resolution of 1 mm in each direction\n(Nx = 243, Ny = 176, Nz = 256). The echo time is TE = 4.59 ms, the inversion time TI = 1.5 s, the repetition\ntime TR = 3.5 s, the bandwidth BW = 250 Hz. As in Section III-D, in order to model an analog acquisition\nscheme, the original image at a resolution of 1 mm is used to compute the measurements, but the reconstruction\nis performed at a resolution of 2 mm. The reconstructed images are compared to the image obtained with a full\nacquisition at 2 mm of resolution.\nThe parameters of our experiment are as follows. Firstly, acquisitions are considered for various numbers M of\ncomplex measurements corresponding to coverages of 15, 25, 50 percent of N . Secondly, instrumental noise is also\nadded to the measurements as independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian noise. The corresponding\nstandard deviation \u03c3 is identical for all the frequencies probed and we consider values of input snr of 2j , with\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 6. Thirdly, the simulated chirp modulation has a chirp rate varying linearly with kz : |w\u0304x | \u2208 [0.12, 0.30]\nand |w\u0304y | \u2208 [0.09, 0.22]. These values for the discrete chirp rate correspond to those used during the real experiment\nperformed hereafter at 1 mm of resolution. However, relatively to the band-limit at 2 mm of resolution, the spectrum\nis naturally more spread than relatively to the band-limit at 1mm of resolution. Therefore, for a reconstruction at\n2 mm of resolution, the spectrum does not need to be spread as much as for a reconstruction at 1 mm of resolution.\nWe thus divided the values of the chirp rate by 2 in both dimensions. Fourthly, the signals are reconstructed by\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f16\n\nVariable density sampling\n\ns2 MRI\n\nFig. 7.

Finally, for each value\nof M and input snr considered, 5 simulations are generated with independent noise and mask realizations, and the\nrelative reconstruction errors are computed for the variable density sampling and s2 MRI techniques.\nThe relative errors of the reconstructions as functions of the input snr for the three coverages considered and\nfor both methods are reported in Fig. 6. The magnitudes of a reconstructed axial slice obtained with the s2 MRI\nand the variable density sampling techniques for an acceleration factor of 5 and an input snr of 32 are presented\nin Fig. 7, along with the corresponding error images. Conclusions of Section III-D still hold with this acquisition\nscheme. The relative error of reconstruction is lower in the presence of the chirp for the three coverage considered.\nWhen comparing the error images in Fig. 7, one can once more notice that the errors are smaller with the s2 MRI\ntechnique.\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f17\n\nC. Experiments\nFor the phantom experiment, a gradient echo sequence is used on a field of view of Lx = Ly = Lz = 192 mm in\nthe three directions with a resolution of 1 mm (Nx = Ny = Nz = 192). The echo time is TE = 6 ms, the repetition\ntime TR = 10 ms, the bandwidth BW = 400 Hz, and the quadratic magnetic field intensity \u03ba = 3000 \u03bcT/m2 . The\ndiscrete chirp rates satisfy |w\u0304x | = |w\u0304y | \u2208 [0.23, 0.36].\nFor the brain experiment, the standard clinical MPRAGE sequence is used on a field of view of Lx = 243 mm,\nLy = 176 mm and Lz = 256 mm, with a resolution of 1 mm in each direction (Nx = 243, Ny = 176, Nz = 256).\nThe echo time is TE = 4.59 ms, the inversion time TI = 1.5 s, the repetition time TR = 3.5 s, the bandwidth\nBW = 250 Hz, and the quadratic magnetic field intensity \u03ba = 4500 \u03bcT/m2 . The discrete chirp rates satisfy\n|w\u0304x | \u2208 [0.25, 0.61] and |w\u0304y | \u2208 [0.18, 0.44].\nSlices of the 3D reconstructions obtained with the s2 MRI technique for 15, 25, 50 and 100 percent of phase\nencodings are presented in Fig. 8 for the phantom and brain acquisitions. The images obtained by inverse Fourier\ntransform of the fully sampled k-space (after correction of the distortions due to the small shifts in the z direction)\nare also presented. Fig. 9 provides a comparison of the reconstructed images obtained with the s2 MRI and the\nvariable density sampling techniques. In the aim of providing further insight on how each method preserves image\nresolution or, in other words, captures shape and magnitude of high frequency features, we also provide onedimensional spatial profiles in Fig. 10. The white lines in Fig. 9 indicate the location of these profiles.\nFirstly, as one would expect, the visual reconstruction quality improves when the number of phase encodings M\nincreases. In the limit of a coverage of 100 percent, we cannot identify any loss of details between the reconstructed\nimages and the ones obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Moreover, the reconstructed image contains much less\nnoise than the image obtained by inverse Fourier transform. Indeed, at a coverage of 100 percent, the problem (3)\nis essentially reduced to a denoising problem.\nSecondly, as in Section III-D, the differences between both methods do not appear at first glance when comparing\nonly the magnitudes of reconstructed images in Fig. 9. Unfortunately here, the ground truth image is not accessible,\nso the corresponding error images cannot be displayed. However, a thorough visual inspection reveals that, for\nacceleration factors larger than 2, some fine details are better recovered by our approach. On the phantom reconstructions for acceleration factors of 6.7 and 4 (coverages of 15 and 25 percent, respectively), the separation between\nthe two biggest circles is more visible. The shapes of the circles are also more curved. On the brain reconstructions\nfor an acceleration factor of 6.7, the vessels at the center of image are still visible with our method but not with\nthe variable density sampling technique. The cerebral cortex also appears sharper. For an acceleration factor of 2,\nthe thin layer separating the two hemispheres of the brain remains more visible with the s2 MRI technique.\nThirdly, the reconstructed spatial profiles of the phantom presented in Fig. 10 show that the shape and magnitude\nof high frequency features are, more often, slightly better recovered with the s2 MRI technique for acceleration\nfactors larger than 4 (blue and red arrows indicate features better reconstructed with s2 MRI and variable density\nsampling respectively). This improvement is much more significant on the brain data (see arrows), and holds for\n\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f18\n\n25%\n\n50%\n\n100%\n\nInverse F.T.\n\ns2 MRI - Sagittal\n\ns2 MRI - Coronal\n\ns2 MRI - Axial\n\ns2 MRI - Sagittal\n\ns2 MRI - Coronal\n\ns2 MRI - Axial\n\n15%\n\nMarch8.13, 2012\nDRAFT\nFig.\nPhantom and brain reconstructions from real experimental data with\nthe\n1 the s2 MRI technique.

For the brain images, some differences remain due to\nsmall movements of the subject between both acquisitions. Let us remark that no fitting of the chirp parameters\n(center and rates) was performed to improve on the theoretical values. This highlights sufficient stability of the\ntechnique relative to parameter approximations.\nV. C ONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION\nWe presented a spread spectrum technique (s2 MRI) designed to accelerate MR acquisitions by compressed\nsensing. It consists of pre-modulating the original image by a linear chirp, which results from the application of\nquadratic phase profiles, and then performing random k-space under-sampling. Non-linear algorithms promoting\nsignal sparsity are then used for image reconstruction.\nIn the context of compressed sensing theory, the effectiveness of the technique is supported by a decrease of\ncoherence between the sensing and sparsity bases due to the pre-modulation. Simulations in a simplified analog\nsetting confirm that the enhancement of the image reconstruction quality is linked to the evolution of the mutual\ncoherence. The s2 MRI technique was compared with the state-of-the-art variable density sampling using realistic\nnumerical simulations and real acquisitions. Simulation results shows that the s2 MRI technique performs slightly\nbetter than the variable density sampling technique in terms of relative reconstruction error for acceleration factors\nlarger than 2. The chirp modulation was also implemented on a 7T scanner with the use of a second order\nshim coil. Simulations of this implementation confirms again the slight superiority of s2 MRI. Visual inspection\nof reconstructions obtained from real acquisition of phantom and in vivo data also shows that this first (non-ideal)\nimplementation provides slightly better reconstruction qualities than the variable density sampling method. The\ns2 MRI technique thus outperforms the variable density sampling technique in terms of all the criteria used for\nevaluation.\nRegarding future evolutions of the s2 MRI technique, an implementation of the linear chirp modulation with the\nuse of RF pulses or dedicated coils could simplify the measurement scheme by applying the chirp modulation only\nduring phase encoding in order to avoid object distortions, and, in turn, further enhance the reconstruction quality.\nMoreover, fitting the effective chirp center and rates on the basis of the data could improve the measurement model\nand result in better reconstructions.\nLet us also emphasize the potential interest of the s2 MRI technique from an enhanced resolution perspective\nas, in the presence of the chirp modulation, the original image is reconstructed at a high resolution in order to\navoid any aliasing problems. One can indeed consider reaching a higher spatial resolution for a fixed acquisition\ntime without probing higher spatial frequencies in practice, which would require stronger gradient coils. In this\ncontext, any regularization approach adding a sparsity prior can help to synthesize spatial frequency information\nhigher than that contained in the data. But the chirp modulation implies that high spatial frequency information is\nactually probed at lower frequencies. For illustration, Fig. 11 shows a reconstructed (x, y) slice for a coverage of\nMarch 13, 2012\n\nDRAFT\n\n\f22\n\nEnhanced resolution\n\nFig. 11.\n\nStandard resolution\n\n1 in the presence of chirp modulation on a high resolution grid of size\nAxial (x, y) reconstructed slice for a coverage of 100 percent\n\nNc = 393 \u00d7 255 (right panel) and after dowsampling on the original grid of size N = 243 \u00d7 176.\n\n100 percent on a high resolution grid Nc = 393 \u00d7 255 as well as the image obtained after downsampling on the\ngrid N = 243 \u00d7 176. One can notice that the high resolution image provides sharper details with fewer aliasing\nartifacts. In particular, the vessels are better resolved.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank David Shuman for his helpful suggestions to improve the writing quality of the paper, as well as the\nreviewers for their very useful comments.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] M.
