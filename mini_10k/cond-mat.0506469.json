Suitable generalization of continuum descriptions of the latter allows us to describe\ntheoretically for the first time the main nonlinear features of ripple dynamics by IBS, namely,\nwavelength coarsening and non-uniform translation velocity, that agree with similar results in experiments and discrete models. These properties are seen to be the anisotropic counterparts of\nin-plane ordering and (interrupted) pattern coarsening in IBS experiments on rotating substrates\nand at normal incidence.\nPACS numbers: 79.20.Rf, 68.35.Ct, 81.16.Rf, 05.45.-a\n\nEver since their earliest observation [1], the production of ripples on the surfaces of amorphous targets subject to ion-beam sputtering (IBS) at intermediate energies, has been fascinating due to the\nsimilarities with macroscopic ripples, like those produced underwater [2], or on the surface of aeolian sand dunes [3]. Beyond the morphological resemblance, IBS ripples share many other properties with e.g. aeolian ripples, such as wavelength\ncoarsening and pattern translation with time [4, 5].\nRemarkably, while typical wavelengths of the latter are above 1 cm, the periodicity of IBS ripples\nis in the 100 nm range [6], these patterns having\ngained increased interest recently for applications in\nNanotechnology, ranging from optoelectronic to catalytic [7]. IBS ripples are produced on a wide class\nof substrates, from amorphous or amorphizable (silica, Si, GaAs, InP) to metallic targets (Cu, Au, Ag)\n[6]. In view moreover of their implied loss of in-plane\nsymmetry, IBS ripples provide interesting instances\nof systems hosting a competition between pattern\nforming and disordering mechanisms [8].\nA successful description of the main features of\nIBS ripples was provided by Bradley and Harper\n(BH) [9], based on Sigmund's linear cascade approximation of sputtering processes in amorphous\nor polycrystalline targets [10]. The linear equation\nderived by BH describes satisfactorily some properties of IBS ripples, such as their alignment with the\nion beam as a function of the incidence angle to target normal \u03b8 [wave vector parallel (perpendicular) to\nthe projection of the ion beam for \u03b8 < \u03b8c (\u03b8 > \u03b8c ),\nfor some threshold \u03b8c ]. Other features, such as ripple\nstabilization or wavelength dependence with ion energy or flux, required non-linear extensions of BH's\napproach [11, 12], leading to an anisotropic gener-\n\nalization of the well known Kuramoto-Sivashinsky\n(KS) equation [8, 11]. However, a notable limitation\nof the anisotropic KS (AKS) equation is its inability to predict ripples that coarsen with time, contradicting observations in many experiments and/or\ndiscrete models of IBS (see [5, 13] and Refs. therein).\nIn this Letter, we introduce a \"hydrodynamic\"\nmodel [3, 14, 15] for IBS ripple production at offnormal incidence. Time scale separation between\nmicroscopic processes (collision cascades, surface diffusion) and pattern evolution allows us to derive an\nimproved equation for the surface height. The new\nnon-linear terms appearing allow for ripple coarsening and pattern translation with non-uniform velocity, as seen in experiments and discrete models.\nOur theory has both the AKS equation [11] and the\nnormal incidence hydrodynamic theory [15, 16] as\nparticular limits, and enables analysis of the important case of rotating substrates [17]. In addition, our\nmodel may be important also to the context of ripples on aeolian sand dunes, where the standard 1D\napproximation requires validation, fully anisotropic\n2D models being scarce [3], as incidentally occurs in\nmany other contexts within Pattern Formation [18].\nDuring IBS of amorphous or semiconductor substrates, in which the ions amorphize the subsurface\nlayer, incident ions lose their energy through random collision cascades in the bulk [10]. Near-surface\natoms receiving enough energy and momentum to\nbreak their bonds are in principle sputtered away, although they may join the current of surface adatoms\nthat are available to other relaxation mechanisms,\nsuch as surface diffusion, before incorporating back\nto the solid bulk. Within the so-called \"hydrodynamic\" approach to aeolian sand dunes [3] and ionsputtered surfaces [14, 15], we consider two coupled\n\n\f2\nfields, namely, the thickness of the mobile surface\nadatoms layer, R(x, t), (related with the density of\nmobile adatoms through the atomic volume) and the\nheight of the bombarded surface above a reference\nplane, h(x, t). Their time evolution is provided by\n\u2202t R = (1 \u2212 \u03c6)\u0393ex \u2212 \u0393ad + D\u22072 R,\n\n(1)\n\n\u2202t h = \u2212\u0393ex + \u0393ad ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u0393ex and \u0393ad are, respectively, rates of atom\nexcavation from and addition to the immobile bulk,\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6) = \u03c6\u0304 measures the fraction of eroded atoms\nthat become mobile, and the third term in Eq. (1)\ndescribes motion of mobile atoms along the surface\nas due to isotropic thermal diffusion (D being a constant for amorphous materials). Even if all eroded\natoms are sputtered away (\u03c6 = 1), we assume a nonzero average fraction of mobile atoms, Req .\nUnder the assumption that nucleation events are\nmore likely in surface protrusions, in analogy to the\nGibbs-Thompson relation we have\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0393ad = \u03b30 R(1 + \u03b32x \u2202x2 h + \u03b32y \u2202y2 h) \u2212 Req , (3)\nwhere \u03b30 is the mean nucleation rate for a flat surface\n(on the xy plane) and \u03b32x , \u03b32y \u2265 0 describe variation\nof the nucleation rate with surface curvatures. Note\nthat, in (3), the full thickness of the mobile adatoms\nlayer is affected by the shape of the surface.\nThe rate at which material is sputtered from the\nbulk depends on the angle of incidence, ion and substrate species, ion flux, energy, and many other experimental parameters. If the beam direction is in\nthe xz plane, we have, following [11, 15]\n+ \u03b12y \u2202y2 h\n\u0393ex = \u03b10 1 + \u03b11x \u2202x h +\n\u0003\n+\u03b13x (\u2202x h)2 +\u03b13y (\u2202y h)2 \u2212(\u2202x h)(\u03b14x \u2202x2 h+\u03b14y \u2202y2 h) ,\n\u0002\n\n\u03b12x \u2202x2 h\n\n(4)\n\nwhere parameters reflect the dependence of \u0393ex on\nthe local shape of the surface [19], as described by\nmore microscopic derivations such as BH or generalizations thereof [11, 20]. Analogous, but not equal,\ngeometrical couplings to the driving occur in aeolian sand dunes [3], or in growth onto amorphous\nsubstrates [21]. Note the loss of reflection symmetry\nin the x direction, but not in the y direction. For\na planar surface, atoms are sputtered from the bulk\nin a typical time of order \u03b1\u22121\n0 .\nThe main difference between former models [9, 11,\n12] and our present model, Eqs. (1)-(4), is that, in\nthe latter, eroded material is allowed to redeposit\nlocally, and there is an implicit viscous flow [22] in\nthe amorphized layer through the evolution of R.\nThese additional mechanisms are seen below to induce richer pattern dynamics than in [9, 11, 12].\n\nThe linearized Eqs. (1)-(4) have solutions Rl =\nR\u0302l eik*x+\u03c9k t , hl = \u0125l eik*x+\u03c9k t , with a dispersion relation, \u03c9k , given in the long wavelength limit by [19]\nRe(\u03c9k ) = \u01eb\u03c6\u03b30 (\u03b12x kx2 + \u03b12y ky2 ) \u2212 \u01eb2 \u03c6\u03c6\u0304\u03b30 \u03b121x kx2\n\u2212Req D(kx2 + ky2 )(\u03b32x kx2 + \u03b32y ky2 ) + O(\u01ebk 4 ), (5)\nIm(\u03c9k ) = \u2212\u01eb\u03c6\u03b30 \u03b11x kx + O(k 3 ),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u01eb \u2261 \u03b10 /\u03b30 is a dimensionless parameter; the\nerosion rate being much smaller than the nucleation\nrate, \u01eb \u226a 1 for typical experiments. Eq. (6) is a simple consequence of the asymmetry in the x direction,\ninduced by the incoming flux.\nThe surface morphology is dominated by the periodic pattern with wave vector kmax making Eq. (5)\na positive maximum. It can be shown [19] that kmax\nis oriented along the x\u0302 or \u0177 directions, as observed\nexperimentally [6]. Close to the instability threshold, before nonlinear terms are no longer negligible,\nmax\none has kx,y\n\u223c \u01eb1/2 . Substituting this into Eqs. (5)\nand (6) provides us with estimations of the typical\ntime and length scales of the pattern, that we employ to rescale X = \u01eb1/2 x, Y = \u01eb1/2 y, T2 = \u01eb2 t and\nT1 = \u01eb3/2 t, and perform a multiple scale expansion\nof Eqs. (1), (2), in which R can be adiabatically eliminated.

(7) generalizes the AKS type equations obtained\n[9, 11, 12] within BH approach to IBS. While sharing the same reflection properties in the x and y\ndirections and most of the terms on the rhs, both\nequations differ crucially by the presence here of the\n(2)\n\u03bbij nonlinearities. Moreover, in the absence of rede(1)\n\n(2)\n\nposition (\u03c6 = 1), \u03bbi and \u03bbij have the same signs,\nmaking Eq. (7) nonlinearly unstable, as in the BH\ncase [15, 24, 25]. Note, the linear dispersion relation of (7) matches Eqs. (5) and (6) above. Under normal incidence, parameters are isotropic and\n\u03b11x = \u03b14x = \u03b14y = 0, Eq. (7) reducing to that obtained in [15, 24], and in [21]. As a final remark,\nlet us quote the form of Eq. (7) for sample rotation around the z axis during bombardment (see e.g.\n[17, 26]). Dynamics of h are given by a different\n\n\f3\nisotropic limit of Eq. (7), namely,\n2\n(2) 2\n2\n\u2202t h = \u2212\u03bdr \u22072 h \u2212 Kr \u22074 h + \u03bb(1)\nr (\u2207h) + \u03bbr \u2207 (\u2207h)\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\u0003\n+ \u03bb(3)\n(8)\nr \u2207 * (\u2207 h)\u2207h ;\n\n(1)\n(1)\n\u03bdr = (\u03bdx + \u03bdy )/2, \u03bb(1)\nr = (\u03bbx + \u03bby )/2,\n1 X (2)\n1 X (2)\n\u03bb(2)\n\u03bbi,j , \u03bb(3)\n\u03bb \u03b4i,j \u2212 \u03bb(2)\nr =\nr =\nr ,\n4 i,j=x,y\n2 i,j=x,y i,j\n\nKr = (3Kx,x + 3Ky,y + Kx,y + Ky,x )/8,\nwith parameters (susbscript \"r\" denotes \"rotating\").\nTo the best of our knowledge, Eq. (7) is new, and\nindeed has a rich parameter space. Numerical integration (not shown) within linear regime retrieves\nall features of the ripple structure as predicted by\nthe BH theory, i.e., dependence of the ripple wavelength with linear terms, and ripple orientation as\na function of \u03b8. Entering the nonlinear regime, and\nas occurs in the AKS equation and its generaliza(1)\ntions [11, 12], nonlinearities \u03bbi lead to saturation\nof the pattern with constant wavelength and amplitude. In absence of these terms, the ripple wavelength grows indefinitely as l(t) \u223c tn with n = 1/2\n[27, 28] until a single ripple remains in a finite simulation domain. As an anisotropic generalization of\nthe ordering process observed for normal incidence\n[15, 16], pattern coarsening requires the presence\n(2)\nof \u03bbi,j , whose magnitude and mathematically correct sign [25] are due to describing redeposition by\nmeans of the additional field R. When the values of\n(1)\nthese coefficients increase relative to \u03bbi , coarsening stops later, and the amplitude and wavelength\nof the pattern also increase. The coarsening exponent n will take an effective value that will be larger\nthe later coarsening stops, and may depend on simulation parameter values. For instance, we show in\nFig. 1 snapshots of a numerical integration of Eq. (7)\n(2)\nfor relatively large \u03bbi,j . The apparent coarsening is\nquantified in the plot of l(t) shown in Fig. 2(a), compatible (after transient effects analogous to those in\n[27]) with n = 0.19. Note the saturation of ripple\nwavelength at long times, together with saturation\nin amplitude, as shown in the plot of the surface\nroughness (rms width) W (t) in Fig. 2(b). These results are similar to those obtained experimentally\nfor IBS of Si in [4]. For a different experiment on Si,\nprecise measurements of the coarsening exponent [5]\nyield n = 0.50(4), no saturation having been observed in this system, as we would expect. Here,\nthe dispersion velocity of the pattern was also measured, finding that it decays with ripple wavelength\nor, equivalently, with time. We have also observed\nthe same trend in the dispersion velocity of the ripples shown in Fig. 1. Experiments also exist, e.g.\nfor IBS of Si, in which ripple coarsening is absent or\n\nFIG. 1: Numerical integration of Eq.

Ripple coarsening has\nbeen also observed in a Monte Carlo model of IBS\n[13], in which rules implement Sigmund's theory. To\nour purpose, the main conclusion of this study is\nthe correlation between an increasing l(t) and nonuniform dispersion velocity, and on the parameterdependent values of the coarsening exponent. Let us\nnote that, on the experimental side, values of n show\na large scatter in the literature (see Refs. in [6, 13]).\nAdditional non-linear effects can be described by Eq.\n(7). A first one is production of grooves (as opposed\nto ripples), due to the loss of up-down symmetry induced by quadratic nonlinearities. Indeed, by chang(1)\ning the sign of \u03bbi , grooves replace ripples, see Fig.\n1(d); this calls for systematic experimental exploration. A second effect is related with cancellation\nmodes (CM), known in the AKS equation [12, 30]\nand other models of IBS [14, 15, 24]. These are lin-\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 3: Numerical integration of Eq.

While for equations like the\none considered in [15, 21] CM affect well-posedness,\nanisotropic systems [12, 30] may remain better defined in the presence of CM. In our case, if reflection\nsymmetry breaking terms are neglected in Eq. (7)\nand BH parameters are used, the same CM occur as\nin the AKS equation. Additional CM ensue between\n(2)\n(1)\nthe \u03bbi and \u03bbi,j terms for appropriate relative signs\n[21, 25]. We have verified numerically that the full\nEq. (7) breaks down for the latter CM, but can support AKS-type CM. That these solutions are physically realizable or are artifacts of the small slope\napproximation made, remains to be assessed. Useful information on this issue might come from field\nexperiments in aeolian sand dunes.\nIn closing, we mention IBS of metals as an immediate experimental domain to which the above\nresults may be relevant [6], albeit differing in the\ndegree of universality. There, however, the correct\nextension of BH theory is not yet clear, nor is its\nimportance relative to anisotropic surface diffusion.\nWe have taken preliminar steps in this context [20],\nand expect to make progress in this direction soon.\nWe thank L.
