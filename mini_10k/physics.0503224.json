Based on the first-principles calculations of GdN, we observe that there is\na transformation in conduction properties associated with the volume increase: first from halfmetallic to semi-metallic, then ultimately to semiconducting. We show that applying stress can\nalter the carrier concentration as well as mobility of the holes and electrons in the majority spin\nchannel. In addition, we found that the exchange parameters depend strongly on lattice constant,\nthus the Curie temperature of this system can be enhanced by applying stress or doping impurities.\nPACS numbers: 75.10.-b, 71.27.+a, 71.70.Gm\n\n1\n\n\fElectronic and transport properties of the rare-earth nitrides have long been a challenge\nto investigators: the nitrides are difficult to fabricate into single phase crystals and the\nexperimental picture of their electronic structures is far from clear. Although most rareearth nitrides have shown to be semi-metallic, there are still uncertainties about GdN. Based\non the direct resistivity measurements, Xiao et al. concluded that GdN is an insulator [1].\nNevertheless, the values they obtained for the resistivity do not rule out the possibility of\na semi-metallic state. Furthermore, there is no clear-cut picture emerging from a series of\nstudies by Kaldis and co-authors in 70's and 80's [2, 3, 4]. They pointed out that the specific\nresistivity decreased with increasing temperature, which suggests that the GdN system is\nsemiconducting [2], while their later experiments on better quality samples showed a very\nlarge carrier concentration of 1.9 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22123 , which is more characteristic of a semi-metal\n[3]. Even though the optical absorption edge for GdN is about 1 eV [4], which is similar\nto other rare-earth nitrides, at issue is the position of the chemical potential relative to the\nband edges in both the spin majority and spin minority band structures.\nAn appealing property of GdN is that it is ferromagnetic with a large gap at the Fermi\nenergy in the minority spin states, according to the electronic structure calculations based\non the local density approximation (LDA) [5, 6, 7]. At the same time GdN is semi-metallic\nin majority spin states with electron and hole pockets at the Fermi surface [6]. This latter\nproperty has led to some interest in GdN as a possible candidate for spin-dependent transport\ndevices [8], exploiting the spin filter, giant magnetoresistance or tunneling magnetoresistance\neffects.\nAn accurate description of the electronic structure of rare-earth compounds is a very\nchallenging problem because of their unfilled 4f shells [9]. Calculations based on local spin\ndensity approximation (LSDA) are well known to underestimate the band gap in semiconductors. Thus LSDA and similar computational methods may not be able to correctly\ndescribe whether a highly correlated system, like GdN, is semi-metallic or semiconducting\nat the equilibrium volume [6]. Nonetheless, if we are interested in the trend of how the electronic and magnetic properties vary with the change of volume, we can obtain a reasonable\npicture for GdN from LSDA with additional Hubbard correlation terms describing on-site\nelectron-electron repulsion associated with the 4f narrow bands (LSDA+U approach) [10].\nActually, due to the fact that the f states of this system are exactly half occupied, there is\nno orbital moment and the anisotropic and multipole effects are minimal. As a result, GdN\n2\n\n\fis the ideal material to study the magnetic exchange interactions in rare-earth nitrides [11].\nIn this letter, we show that applying stress can influence significantly the electronic and\nmagnetic properties of GdN. Using the first-principles approaches, we demonstrate that the\nsystem exhibits nominal \"half-metallic\" band structure at the equilibrium lattice constant,\nand then semi-metallic and/or semiconducting character develops with increasing lattice\nconstant. We note that the magnetic properties are also extremely sensitive to the volume\nvariations, i.e., the exchange interactions are at first ferromagnetic, then the calculated\nmagnitudes of exchange parameters reduce substantially with increasing volume, suggesting\nthat the Curie temperature is reduced with an increase in lattice constant.\nThe first-principles band structure approach applied in this work is the full-potential\nlinear-augmented-plane-wave plus local-orbital method [12]. In the total energy calculations,\nthe factor RM T Kmax is chosen to be 8. We found that using as large as 4000 k-points in\nthe Brillouin zone was necessary to obtain the energy convergence up to 0.1 meV. Following\nthe previous work [13], we used a Hubbard U = 6.7 eV and an exchange J = 0.7 eV for Gd\ncompounds in the LSDA+U scheme [10]. The calculated density of states (DOS) of GdN\nagrees well with photoemission data of nitrogen covered Gd(0001) surfaces [14], as shown\nin Fig. 1. Given that both experiment and theory share the similar lattice structures, this\nsuggests that our computational approach correctly represents the electronic structure of\nGdN.\nWhen we studied the band structure, we found that, for the theoretical lattice constant\na = 4.92 \u00c5 [Fig. 2(a)], our LSDA+U calculations show that there exist a hole pocket at \u0393\npoint and an electron pocket at X point. Strong hybridization between Gd 5d and N 2p spin\nmajority states is clearly shown around the X point, while there is no such hybridization\nfor spin minority states, indicating GdN to be half-metallic, with a gap about 0.6 eV in the\nspin minority channel. As we increase the lattice constant, this system gradually develops\nsemi-metallic features in the majority states: e.g., the d \u2212 p hybridization around X point\ndisappears and the Fermi level down shifts to the top of the hole section at \u0393 point [Fig.\n2(b)]. With further increase of volume the system eventually becomes semiconducting [Fig.\n2(c)]. The exact volume at which metal-semimetal or semimetal-semiconductor transitions\noccurs might not be precisely determined from LSDA-based calculations. However, the trend\nis clear and the predicted transitions could be observed experimentally.\nWe note that volume expansion or applied strain can be used to control the carrier density\n3\n\n\fas well as to some degree the mobility of the carriers, as can be seen from the band dispersion\ncurves near the Fermi energy, in Fig. 2. At larger volumes the electron (hole) pockets become\nsubstantially shallower, meaning that the bottom (top) of the band approaches the Fermi\nenergy and the area of the Fermi surface decreases. This is quite clear, for example, when\ncomparing the hole pockets around \u0393 point in Fig. 2(a) and (b), especially those Fermi-level\ncrossing points. As a result, the density of states at the Fermi energy reduces by about 50%\nwhen lattice parameter is increased by only 5%. And the decrease of dEk /dk (tangent to the\nband dispersion) at Fermi level can also be seen from Fig. 2, indicating that the mobility of\nthe holes decreases with the increase of the cell volume.\nFurthermore, as also can be seen from Fig. 2, the indirect band gap of GdN can be\nmodified by hydrostatic pressure. Based on the prediction of electron-hole-liquid theory\n[15], a first-order semiconductor to semimetal transition starts to take place as the indirect\nband gap decreases with decreasing lattice constant. Thus it is conceivable that with proper\ncontrol of the indirect gap via external pressure, it is possible to explore the ground state of\nthis correlated electron-hole liquid, and tune experimentally the semimetal phase transition.\nWe have also explored the modifications of the band structure and electronic properties\ndue to the biaxial strain, which can be produced by epitaxially growing the film on the\nsubstrate with a different lattice constant. When the lattice parameter of the substrate is\ndifferent from that of equilibrium GdN, the lattice mismatch can produce strain. In such\ncases, the lattice symmetry of GdN becomes tetragonal with c/a ratio less than 1 (larger\nsubstrate lattice constant, tensile strain) or larger than 1 (smaller substrate lattice constant,\ncompressive strain). We performed total energy calculation on the Poisson ratio \u03bd for GdN\nby applying the biaxial strain in ab plane and observing the variation of c, then by comparing\nthe biaxial strain given as\n2\u03bd\n\u2206c/c0\n=\u2212\n,\n\u2206a/a0\n1\u2212\u03bd\nwe deduced a \u03bd = 0.2, which is small compared to metals but similar to the known value of\nTiN. We found that the trend of band structure change, due to the biaxial strain, remains\nqualitatively the same as that caused by volume strain, which is expected because of the small\nPoisson ratio. The unit cell volume of GdN increases due to biaxial tensile stress, hence the\nmodification of the band structure near the Fermi energy is similar to that observed during\nvolume expansion. This may imply that the tensile stress tends to force the system to be\nless metallic and decreases the density of states near Fermi surface. When applying the\n4\n\n\fcompressive strain, the system tends to become more metallic. Based on our calculations,\nthe minority spin shows considerable reduction in the band gap with bands cross over Fermi\nenergy with in-plane compressive strain of 3% and then the system is no longer half-metallic.\nWe also found that the change in electronic structure with the applied stress significantly\naffects the magnetic properties of GdN, particularly, the exchange interactions. We analyzed\nthe exchange interactions using Heisenberg Hamiltonian:\nH=\u2212\n\nX\n\nJn\n\nn\n\nX\n\n~i * S\n~j ,\nS\n\ni>j\n\nwhere Jn are exchange parameters and n is the index of the nearest-neighbor shell. In these\ncalculations, we limited our considerations to the third nearest neighbor interactions, i.e., n\nruns from 1 to 3. The exchange parameters used in the model Hamiltonian, are obtained\nfrom the first-principles band structure calculations. To do this, we carried out total energy\ncalculations on four different magnetic ordering configurations of the fcc structure. One is\nferromagnetic (FM) ordering, and the other three are anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) orderings,\nas have been described in Ref. [16] and here for convenience are called AFM I, II and III,\nrespectively. According to the model Hamiltonian, the total exchange energies per magnetic\nlattice site of the four magnetic orderings can be explicitly expressed as:\nEF M = E0 + 6J1 + 3J2 + 12J3 ,\nEAF MI = E0 \u2212 2J1 + 3J2 \u2212 4J3 ,\nEAF MII = E0 \u2212 3J2 ,\nEAF MIII = E0 \u2212 2J1 + J2 + 4J3 ,\nwhere E0 is the reference energy. Based on these equations and the results obtained from the\ntotal energy calculations, those J parameters can be deduced accordingly. Due to the fact\nthat the energy differences between these ordering states are generally very small, extreme\ncare is needed in the calculations. Hence, comparisons are only made between FM and AFM\nenergies calculated on the same structure and with the same computational parameters, to\navoid any error caused by the different symmetries or shapes.\nOur LSDA+U calculation gives the correct ground state for GdN, i.e., FM ordering. The\nJn values are, nonetheless, quite small, which is expected from the low transition temperature. In addition, we found that these exchange parameters of GdN depend strongly on the\n5\n\n\flattice constant (Fig. 3). When the lattice constant is increasing, the FM J1 decreases and\nJ2 even changes sign, namely from FM to AFM, while J3 keeps almost the same. Thus the\nFM transition temperature Tc , which is proportional to the sum of neighboring exchange\nenergies 12J1 + 6J2 + 24J3 according the mean-field theory, is sensitive to the change of\nlattice constants.\nIt is well known that the oscillatory Rudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type interaction\nvaries sensitively with the density of charge carriers. Thus, based on the above observations,\nwe can see that the enhancement of the exchange interactions between neighboring magnetic\nsites, when the lattice constant decreases, is caused by the increase of the number of free\ncharge carriers as the GdN system becomes more metallic. Actually, the strong lattice constants dependence of the J parameters of GdN is a manifestation of strong lattice constants\ndependence of its electronic structure, which lies between the metal and insulator phase.\nFurthermore, the trend of J2 with the increase of the volume implies the strengthening of\nan AFM superexchange interaction when the system becomes less metallic. This can be\nunderstood as a competition between the superexchange and indirect carrier mediated exchange interactions. Usually the former is roughly proportional to t2 /U, where t is the band\nenergy or hopping integral, and does not change too strongly when the lattice parameter\nincreases. Whereas the later, as we already discussed, would decrease with the increase of\nthe lattice constant. Hence this reduction causes an overall increase in the antiferromagnetic\ncoupling between second-nearest-neighbor Gd sites. Therefore we can see that the magnetic\nproperties of Gd nitride are strongly related to their electronic properties. Based on these\nfindings, we expect that GdN, in which a strong AFM and FM competition exists, could\nbe AFM [4] or even more complicated structure such as spin-glass [17] when experiencing\ndifferent stress.\nMonte Carlo (MC) simulations, based on the model Heisenberg Hamiltonian with ab initio\nderived exchange parameters are used to obtain the Curie temperature. Same method has\nbeen applied successfully in the study of complex permanent magnetic materials [18]. The\nlattice studied in our MC simulation is a 10a \u00d7 10a \u00d7 10a fcc cell (4000 spins) with periodic\nboundary conditions, where a is the lattice constant. At theoretical lattice parameter (a =\n4.92 \u00c5) we find the Curie temperature to be about 38 K, agreed reasonably well with the\nexperimentally observed 58 K. This agreement is quite impressive, considering the strong\ncorrelated nature of this system. One possible reason for the underestimate of Tc may arise\n6\n\n\ffrom neglecting the correlated hopping processes in one-electron picture, which are higher\norder processes proposed by Kasuya and Li to explain of ferromagnetic exchange in GdN\n[19]. In addition, we found that the energy levels of 4f states are crucial in determining the\naccurate exchange parameters. Our calculation on equilibrium structure of GdN, based on\nthe present U parameter, gives the unoccupied 4f states 5 eV above EF and occupied 4 f\nstates 6 eV below, which is in good qualitative agreement with the experimental situation\n[20], providing support for the validity of our studies of the magnetic properties of GdN.\nOrdinarily, we would expect the ferromagnetic ground state to provide a stabilizing role\nto the spin-dependent electric conduction. Thus to enhance the Curie temperature of GdN\nto practical range is quite important. As we already mentioned above, one possible way\nis to apply stress. Moreover, doping impurities can also be an alternative: it was reported\nthat by adding few percent of magnetic ions such as Mn, the Tc of GaN or ZnO well exceeds\nroom temperature range [21], hence we believe this is a promising remedy for concern that\nthe Curie temperature of GdN is on the low side.\nIn summary, we have found that there is a large lattice constant dependence of the electronic and magnetic properties in the spin dependent band structure of GdN. This material,\nwith half-metallic gap about 0.6 eV, exhibits a ferromagnetic ground state, rendering it\nan attractive candidate for spintronic devices. Hence we appeal strongly for experimental\nefforts to study this interesting compound and validate our claim.\nThe authors acknowledge helpful discussions with A.G. Petukhov.

The new photoemission features that are not attributable to the Gd(0001) substrate\ncompare well with the calculated DOS for GdN. Features with strong N 2p weight are indicated.\nBinding energies for experiment are shifted to higher binding energies as expected with a final state\nspectroscopy of a correlated electron system, but the shift is roughly uniform for key features of\nthe photoemission spectra (taken for both s and p polarized light).\nFIG. 2: Band structure of GdN in the vicinity of the Fermi energy for three volumes: (a) at the\ncalculated equilibrium lattice parameter a = 4.92 \u00c5, (b) at the lattice parameter increased by 5%\n(a = 5.16 \u00c5), (c) at the lattice parameter increased by 14% (a = 5.63 \u00c5). Solid and dotted lines\nrepresent spin majority and spin minority states, respectively. The change of conducting properties\nare indicated by the change of energy difference between the top (bottom) of the hole (electron)\npockets and the Fermi energy.\n\nFIG. 3: Exchange parameters of GdN plotted as function of the lattice constant; notice the strong\nvolume dependence of J1 and J2 .\n\n9\n\n\f"}
