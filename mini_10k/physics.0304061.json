Because the paleomagnetic sampling was done in few hours during the resupply of the French scientific base Martin du Viviers by the Marion Dufresne vessel,\nwe could collected only 29 samples from 4 lava flows. The directional results corroborate\nthe findings by Watkins & Nougier (1973) : normal polarity is found for two units and\nan intermediate direction, with associated Virtual Geomagnetic Poles (VGPs) close to\nthe equator, for the other two units. A notable result is that these volcanic rocks are\nwell suited for absolute paleointensity determinations. Fifty percent of the samples yields\nreliable intensity values with high quality factors. An original element of this study is\nthat we made use of the thermomagnetic criterion PTRM-tail test of Shcherbakova et\n\n\f2\n\nCarvallo et al.\nal. (2000) to help in the interpretation of the paleointensity measurements. Doing thus,\nonly the high temperature intervals, beyond 400\u25e6 C, were retained to obtain the most\nreliable estimate of the strength of the ancient magnetic field. However, not applying the\nPTRM-tail test does not change the flow-mean values significantly because the samples\nwe selected by conventional criteria for estimating the paleointensity carry only a small\nproportion of their remanence below 400\u25e6 C. The normal units yield Virtual Dipole Moments (VDM) of 6.2 and 7.7 (1022 Am2 ) and the excursional units yield values of 3.7 and\n3.4 (1022 Am2 ).

This implies that paleomagnetic field variations derived from such records\ncan be interpreted as transitional fields. Recently, Gubbins (1999) proposed a physical explanation to this hypothesis. According to Gubbins excursions may occur when two reversals of\nopposite sense follow one another in the liquid outer core, which has timescales of about 500\nyr, within such a short time interval that the field does not have enough time to reverse its\npolarity in the solid inner core, which occurs by diffusion with typical timescales of 3 Kyr. In\nother words, he considers that the longer dynamical timescales of the solid inner core delay\n\u22c6 Now at Geophysics, Department of Physics, University of Toronto, Canada\n\u2020 Corresponding author.

This physical distinction between successful and unsuccessful\nreversals agrees with both the duration of excursions, estimated at a few thousands years,\nand with their number of about ten observed within the Brunhes period (from 780 Kyr to\npresent time) (Langereis et al., 1997). To validate such models one must know the exact\nduration of excursions and the frequency of their occurrences between two consecutive full\nreversals. However even for the Brunhes period, we are not yet able to precisely describe the\nexcursion succession and their individual characteristics. Some excursions are not clearly\nestablished, the global occurrence of some others is questioned (Langereis et al., 1997).\nFor example, the Mono Lake excursion (\u2248 28 ka) is observed only in sediments from\nthe western North America (Liddicoat & Coe, 1979; Levi & Karlin, 1989; Liddicoat, 1992;\nLiddicoat, 1996) and from Arctic Sea (Nowaczyk & Antonow, 1997) and thus may only reflect a strong regional secular variation feature. To date only 6 excursions within the Brunhes\nperiod seem well established, accurately dated and appear to occur globally. This is the case\nfor Laschamp (40-45 Ka), Blake (110-120 Ka), Jamaica/Pringle Falls (218 \u00b110 ka), Calabrian Ridge 1 (315-325 ka) and 2 (515-525 ka) and Emperor/Big Lost (560-570 ka) (see\ne.g. Langereis et al. (1997) and reference therein for a review). Nevertheless it is not yet\ncompletely ascertained whether global excursions are synchronous all over the globe or start\nat some locations before spreading over the entire core surface. The answer to this question\nis of importance for both geodynamo models and correlations of high resolution sedimentary\nsequences. Furthermore, the available data set is somewhat incomplete: most of the excursions have been mainly described from recordings in sediments which are less reliable than\nvolcanic rocks in term of paleodirection, particularly when the field intensity is low, which\nis a common characteristic of the Brunhes excursions (Guyodo & Valet, 1999). It is however\nnot surprising that the volcanic recordings are rare, since due to the sporadic character of the\nvolcanic extrusion rate and the short duration assumed for excursions, the probability that a\nlava flow occurs during an excursion is very small. As a consequence, few studies have been\ncarried out on absolute paleointensities during Brunhes excursions (Roperch et al., 1988;\n\n\f4\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\nChauvin et al., 1989; Levi et al., 1990; Quidelleur et al., 1999; Schnepp & Hradetzky, 1994;\nZhu et al., 2000).\nIn this context, we decided to reexamine a geomagnetic excursion supposed to belong to\nthe Brunhes period and previously described by Watkins & Nougier (1973) in lava flows from\nAmsterdam Island (southeastern Indian Ocean). This event has never been radiometrically\ndated. Our objectives were first to complete the paleomagnetic record with paleointensity\ndeterminations and to identify this geomagnetic event by radiometric dating. We also wanted\nto check the presence of excursional directions. In this paper we report directional results\nand high quality paleointensity determinations for four lava flows from Amsterdam Island.\nTheses results combined with\n\n40\n\nAr/39 Ar isotopic ages provide more concrete evidence for\n\nthe occurrence of a geomagnetic excursion recorded in Amsterdam lava during the late\nPleistocene which may corresponds either to Mono Lake or Laschamp.\n\n2\n\nGEOLOGICAL SETTING AND PALEOMAGNETIC SAMPLING\n\nAmsterdam Island stands where a mantle plume is interacting with a migrating mid-ocean\nridge (Small, 1995). Amsterdam/Saint-Paul plateau was built within the past 4 Ma since the\nSouth East Indian Ridge (SEIR) passed over the Amstardam/Saint-Paul hotspot (Royer & Schlich, 1988).\nCurrently, Amsterdam Island (37.5\u25e6S, 77.3\u25e6E) is located 50 km southwest of the SEIR,\nwhich is migrating to the northeast away from the plume. Lying on the nearly stationary Antarctic plate, it has been suggested that the Amsterdam/Saint-Paul plateau is still\nforming (Graham et al., 1999) and that volcanic risk still exists at Amsterdam and Saint\nPaul Islands (Johnson et al., 2000). Thus located in the immediate vicinity of a mid-ocean\nridge, lava from Amsterdam has mainly tholeiitic geochemical composition, ranging from\nolivine tholeiite to plagioclase basalt. From a structural point of view, this volcanic island\ncorresponds to a double strato-volcano (Gunn et al., 1971). The first cycle of activity is represented by a volcano centered on the southern part of the island, where Mount du Fernand\nand Le Pinion correspond to remnants of a volcanic caldera (Fig. 1). The west flank of this\nearly volcano collapsed along two main faults oriented NW-SE and NE-SW, respectively,\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n\n5\n\ncreating about 800 m vertical offset and an unreachable escarpment that exposes a multitude\nof thin lava flows. The second cycle of activity built the Mount de la Dives volcano, which is\na simple almost symmetrical volcanic cone rising to 881 m above sea level. This episode represents a displacement of the eruptive center of 2 km toward the east-northeast. The caldera\non top of this young cone preserves evidence of a lava lake filled by several episodes of lava\neffusion which overspilled as voluminous, pahoehoe lava flows. The flanks of this volcano\nhave regular slopes, 7 to 13\u25e6 , and are not dissected by erosion. Marine erosion has formed a\ncliff 25-50 m high at sea level around the island which makes access from the sea difficult.\nAlthough radiometric ages were not available before the present study, the nearly-pristine\nmorphology leaves no doubt that this volcanic activity is recent. Some parasitic cinder cones\nexist on the lower flanks of Mount de la Dives volcano. The youngest one is supposed to be\nformed during the last century.\nThe paleomagnetic samples were taken in few hours during the resupply of the permanent\nscientific station by the Marion-Dufresne vessel. Because of the limited schedule, we decided\nto confine the sampling to the northwestern coast where Watkins & Nougier (1973) studied\nsix lava flows in a restricted area. Four of these flows provided excursional directions. We\ngrouped Watkins & Nougier's (1973) flows 17 and 18, because of their confusing boundary\ngeometries, into a single unit (am1). Probably they constitute a compound lava flow corresponding to a single volcanic eruption. Their flow 19, herein called am2, is located several\nmeters above and corresponds undoubtly to a different volcanic eruption. Unfortunately, we\nwere not able to reach Watkins & Nougier's (1973) flows 13, 14, and 15, because of the\npresence in this sector of numerous fur seals which made the access dangerous. Instead, we\nsampled two previously-unstudied flows (am3 and am4; Fig. 1). Seven cores from each of\nflows am1-2-4 and eight from flow am3 were drilled using a gasoline-powered portable drill\nand were oriented with respect to geographic north by means of both solar sightings and\nmagnetic compass plus a clinometer. Based on stratigraphic relationships, all four sampled\nvolcanic units belong to the youngest flows of the Mount de la Dives volcano. On the basis\n\n\f6\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\nof field observations, flow am4 is certainly younger than the other three. We have, on the\nother hand, no way to decipher the age relations between flows am1-2 and flow am3.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nPALEODIRECTION DETERMINATIONS\nExperimental procedure\n\nFor the analysis of remanence direction, we first treated a pilot sample from each flow using\na detailed experimental procedure involving up to 13 alternating fields (AF) cleaning steps\nin order to check the possible presence of unstable components of remanence. Because of the\nsimple behavior of remanence upon cleaning (Fig. 2), we used only 4 or 5 AF steps for the\nremaining samples. Measurements of remanent magnetization were carried out with a JR-5A\nspinner magnetometer and the AF treatments, with a laboratory built AF demagnetizer in\nwhich the sample is stationary and subjected to peak fields up to 140 mT. The analysis of the\ndemagnetization diagrams is straightforward for all the samples but one, sample 693 from\nflows am3 was contaminated by a significant parasitic magnetization of unknown origin. We\ndetermined the Characteristic Remanent Magnetization (ChRM) by means of the principal\ncomponent analysis using the Maximum Angular Deviation (MAD) (Kirschvink, 1980) as a\nmeasure of the inherent scatter in directions. In order to check if the principal component\nis a robust estimate of the sample ChRM, we compared this direction with the fitting line\nconstrained through the origin. When the angle between these two directions exceeds the\nMAD (Audunsson & Levi, 1997) we concluded that the principal component is statistically\ndifferent from the ChRM, and thus that the ChRM is not perfectly isolated. This method led\nto the rejection of only one sample (693) from further analysis, considering that no ChRM\ncould be successfully determined for this sample. We averaged the directions thus obtained\nby flow, and calculated the statistical parameters assuming a fisherian distribution (Table 1).\nThe ChRM directions are well clustered in each flow with rather small values of the 95 %\nconfidence cone about the mean direction (\u03b195 ), all \u2264 5\u25e6 .\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n3.2\n\n7\n\nPaleodirection results\n\nThe directional results obtained for flows am1 and am2 corroborate exactly the finding by\nWatkins & Nougier (1973): an intermediate polarity with associated Virtual Geomagnetic\nPoles (VGPs) close to the equator is found. This result is not surprising insofar as the\nremanence of the lava from Amsterdam is not contaminated by significant spurious components. This was not the case, for example, in a recent study on the volcanic sequence from\nPossession Island (Camps et al., 2001), where the authors concluded that the intermediate\ndirections initially described by Watkins et al. (1972) correspond to reversed directions which\nhad been incompletely cleaned of their present-day field viscous overprint. Here, we believe\nthat the previously published data for Amsterdam Island (Watkins & Nougier, 1973), which\nwere not resampled in the present study are, equally reliable.\n\nBecause flows am1 and am2 yield two similar directions and because they are in a\nsingle sequence on a small cliff, one can ask whether the time elapsed between these two\nflows is long enough to consider them separately. To try to reply briefly, we performed the\nbootstrap test for a common mean (Tauxe, 1998). Because the 95 % bound interval for\nthe Cartesian Y and Z coordinates calculated for these two directions do not overlap each\nother (Fig. 3), we concluded that these directions are statistically different and thus can\nbe analyzed individually. Flows am3 and am4 give normal directions. They can be used to\ncomplete Watkins & Nougier's (1973) dataset in order to estimate the amplitude of secular\nvariation from the Indian Ocean for the Brunhes period.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nPALEOINTENSITY DETERMINATIONS\nExperimental procedure\n\nPaleointensity determinations were carried out using the classical Thellier and Thellier\n(1959) method. The samples are heated two times at each temperature step, in the presence\nof a field positive for the first heating and negative for the second heating. Partial thermore-\n\n\f8\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\nmanent magnetization (pTRM) checks were performed every two steps in order to detect\nmagnetic changes during heating. We used a laboratory field of 30 \u03bcT aligned along the\ncore z axis. All heatings and coolings were done in a vacuum better than 10\u22124 mbar with\nthe intention of reducing mineralogical changes during heatings, which are usually due to\noxidation. Samples were heated in 14 steps between 150 and 580 \u25e6 C, by 50\u25e6 C between 150\nand 500 \u25e6 C, then 20\u25e6 C steps between 500 and 540\u25e6 C, and finally 10\u25e6 C steps between 540\nand 580\u25e6C. Each heating-cooling step required about 10 hours. Because paleointensity measurements require time-consuming procedures, it is important to detect unsuitable samples\nbefore carrying out the full experiments.\n\n4.2\n\nSample selection and rock magnetism properties\n\nVolcanic rocks used for absolute paleointensity determinations must satisfy the following\nconditions :\n(i) The natural remanent magnetization (NRM) of samples must consist of a single component close to the mean characteristic remanence direction of the flow. In addition, the viscosity index (Thellier & Thellier, 1944) must be small enough to obtain reliable data during\nthe heating demagnetization steps at low temperatures. We found that all the samples have\nmagnetic viscosity coefficients smaller than 4%; therefore no samples were eliminated on this\nbasis, except sample 693 which shows a strong secondary component of magnetization.\n(ii) The magnetic properties of the samples must be thermally stable. To check it, we\nperformed continuous low-field magnetic susceptibility measurements under vacuum (better than 10\u22122 mbar) as a function of temperature (Fig. 4) for the 28 remaining samples.\nThe device used for this experiment is a Bartington susceptibility meter MS2 equipped\nwith a furnace in which the heating and cooling rates remain constant at 7\u25e6 /mn. Seven\nsamples having irreversible thermomagnetic curves were rejected for the final selection of\npaleointensity results. Mean Curie temperatures (Pr\u00e9vot et al., 1983) vary between 450 and\n570\u25e6 C (Table 2). These values also indicate that the magnetic carriers are mainly Ti-poor\ntitanomagnetite (x < 0.2) (Dunlop & \u00d6zdemir, 1997).\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n\n9\n\n(iii) The remanence carriers must be single domain (SD) or pseudo-single domain (PSD)\ngrains. It is widely accepted that multi domain (MD) grains give erroneous results because\nof the inequality of their blocking and unblocking temperatures and the influence of the\nthermal prehistory on pTRM intensity (Vinogradov & Markov, 1989). In order to determine\nthe domain structure, we measured the hysteresis parameters using an alternative gradient\nforce magnetometer at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. According to the\ncriteria defined by Day et al. (1977) all the hysteresis parameters are in the PSD part of the\nplot (Fig. 5 and Table 2). However, a mixture of SD and MD grains could give the same\nresult. Most samples are characterized by a very high median destructive field (Table 2)\nwhich is a further evidence of the presence of SD-PSD grains.\n\n4.3\n\nPreliminary selection of paleointensity data\n\nThe parameters used as criteria for a preliminary data selection are defined as follows, based\non selection criteria commonly used for paleointensity experiments.\n(i) The number N of successive points on the linear segments chosen to calculate the\npaleointensity must be at least 4.\n(ii) The fraction of NRM destroyed on this segment must be greater than 1/3.\n(iii) The MAD calculated with the principal component calculated in the temperature\ninterval used for paleointensity estimate must be less than 15\u25e6 and the angle \u03b1 between the\nvector average and this principal component also less than 15\u25e6 (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000).\n(iv) The pTRM checks have to be positive, i.e. the deviation of pTRM quantified by\nthe difference ratio (Selkin & Tauxe, 2000), which corresponds to the maximum difference\nbetween repeat pTRM steps normalized by the length of the selected NRM-pTRM segment,\nhas to be less than 10% before and within the linear segment. Failure of a pTRM check is an\nindication of irreversible magnetic and/or chemical changes in the ferromagnetic minerals\nduring the laboratory heating.\n\n\f10\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\n4.4\n\nPTRM-tail test\n\nIn order to give us some indication about the domain states as a function of the temperature, we performed the pTRM-tail test that was first introduced by Bol'shakov &\nShcherbakova (1979) and modified later by Shcherbakova et al. (2000). The principle of\nthis test is as follows: if a sample is given a pTRM on an interval [T1 , T2 ] (T1 > T2 ),\nthen is heated up to T1 and cooled down in zero-field, the pTRM will be completely demagnetized only if the remanence carrier is single-domain. For pseudo-single-domain or\nmulti-domain material, the pTRM will be completely demagnetized only after heating\nto a temperature higher than T1 , this temperature reaching all the way to TC for MD\ngrains (Bol'shakov & Shcherbakova, 1979). Note that this test can only be applied to samples that do not alter chemically during heating. As discussed later, the Amsterdam samples\nare unusually stable, permitting wide application of this test.\nThe pTRM-tail test was carried out using a thermal vibrating magnetometer which\nallows the measurement of the magnetic remanence and the induced magnetization of a\nrock sample. The dimensions of the sample are 11 mm height and 10 mm diameter. The\nstatic residual field in the heating zone is less than 20 nT. It is possible to apply a direct field\non the sample by sending a constant current to an inner coil placed between the detection\ncoils and the heater. The two detection coils are connected in opposition. The sample is\nalternatively translated from the center of the first detection coil to the center of the other\ndetection coil with a frequency of 13.7 Hz with 25.4 mm amplitude. The heater is powered\nwith an alternating pulse width modulated current at a frequency of 3740 Hz. The output\nsignal is directly applied to the current input of the lock-in amplifier Stanford Research\nSR830. After signal acquisition and calibration, we measure the magnetization moment\nversus temperature with a precision of 2 \u00d7 10\u22128 Am2 (with a time constant of 300 mS).\nPTRM acquisitions were performed in air on sister samples (i.e., adjoining samples from\nthe same paleomagnetic core), using a 100 \u03bcT field, in four different temperature intervals:\n[300\u25e6 C, Troom ], [400\u25e6 C, 300\u25e6 C], [500\u25e6 C, 400\u25e6C] and [550\u25e6 C, 500\u25e6 C]. PTRMs were imparted\n\"from above\": the samples were first demagnetized by heating them in zero field to TC ,\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n\n11\n\nthen a 100 \u03bcT is applied during the cooling down between the temperatures T1 and T2 ,\nand pTRM(T1 ,T2 ) was measured at room temperature. Samples were subsequently heated\nagain to T1 , cooled down in zero field, and the tail of pTRM(T1 ,T2 ) measured at room\ntemperature. Fig. 6 illustrates the succession of pTRM acquisitions and demagnetizations.\nWe calculated the parameter A defined by\nA(T1 , T2 ) =\n\ntail[pTRM(T1 , T2 )]\n100%\npTRM(T1 , T2 )\n\n(1)\n\nas the relative intensity measured at room temperature of the pTRM tail remaining after\nheating to T1 . According to the criteria defined by Shcherbakova et al. (2000), A(T1 , T2 ) < 4%\ncorresponds to SD, 4% < A(T1 , T2 ) < 15% to PSD and A(T1 , T2 )>15% to MD. Table 2\nshows the values of A(T1 , T2 ) for the four temperature intervals used on the 17 remaining\nsamples. All the samples have an MD response for pTRM's imparted in the intervals [300\u25e6 C,\nTr ] and [400\u25e6 C, 300\u25e6 C]. However they all have a PSD response (except sample 669 which\nhas an MD response) for the pTRM given in the interval [500\u25e6 C, 400\u25e6 C], and PSD or SD\nresponse for a pTRM given in the interval [550\u25e6 C, 500\u25e6 C]. Fig. 7 illustrates typical MD\nand SD thermomagnetic behavior. Guided by these results we did not include any point on\nthe Arai plot acquired before 400\u25e6 C (500\u25e6C for sample 669) to calculate the paleointensity\nestimates.\n\n4.5\n\nPaleointensity results\n\nResults are plotted as NRM lost as a function of pTRM gained on an Arai graph (Nagata et al., 1963).\nExamples of typical good samples are shown on Fig. 8 with associated orthogonal vector diagrams. Fourteen samples fulfilled all the criteria defined above and were then considered as\nyielding reliable results (Table 3). Most results have high quality factor (q) values (between\n15 and 70) and the success rate of 50%, calculated on the whole collection, is very high and\nsomewhat unusual for natural rocks.\nAveraging four acceptable results, the flow am1 (excursional unit) gives a paleointensity of 24.6 \u03bcT and a Virtual Dipole Moment (VDM) of 3.7\u00d71022 Am2 (Table 3). The flow\nam2 (excursional unit) gives an average paleointensity (using two results) of 24.0 \u03bcT, corre-\n\n\f12\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\nsponding to a VDM of 3.4\u00d71022 Am2 . The two normal flows (am3 and am4) give averages\nof 32.8\u03bcT (using 5 values) and 46.9\u03bcT (using 3 values), yielding VDM's of 6.2\u00d71022 Am2\nand 7.7\u00d71022 Am2 , respectively.\n\n40\n\n5\n5.1\n\nAr /\n\n39\n\nAr AGE DETERMINATIONS\n\nAnalytical procedure\n\nFor each sample, 300 mg of whole rock fragments were carefully hand-picked under a binocular microscope from crushed 0.5 mm thick rock slabs. The samples were wrapped in Cu\nfoil to form small packets as small as possible (11x11 mm.). These packets were stacked up\nto form a pile within which packets of flux monitors were inserted every 5 to 10 samples,\naccording to the size of the samples. The stack, put in an irradiation can, was irradiated,\nwith a Cd shield, for 1 hr at the McMaster University reactor (Hamilton, Canada) with\na total flux of 1.3 x 1017 n.cm\u22122 . The irradiation standard was the Fish-Canyon sanidine\n(28.02 Ma; Renne et al. (1998)).\nThe sample arrangement allows monitoring of the flux gradient with a precision as low\nas \u00b10.2 %. The step-heating experiment procedure was described in details by Ruffet et\nal. (1991). The mass spectrometer consists of a 120 M.A.S.S.E. R tube, a B\u00e4ur Signer R\nsource and an SEV 217 R electron-multiplier (total gain: 5\u00d71012 ) whereas the all metal\nextraction and purification lines include two SAES GP50W getters with St101 R zirconiumaluminium alloy operating at 400\u25e6 C and a -95\u25e6 C cold trap. Samples were incrementally\nheated in a molybdenum crucible using a double vacuum high frequency furnace. The extraction segment of the line was pumped 3 minutes between each step.\nIsotopic measurements are corrected for K and Ca isotopic interferences and mass discrimination. All errors are quoted at the 1\u03c3 level and do not include the errors on the\n40\n\nAr\u2217 /39 ArK ratio and age of the monitor. The error in the\n\nincluded in the isochron age error bars calculation.\n\n40\n\nAr\u2217 /39 ArK ratio of monitor is\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n5.2\n\n40\n\n13\n\nAr\u2217 /39 ArK results\n\nThe very low K- and rather high Ca-contents of the analyzed samples and their very young\napparent age were unfavorable parameters to produce high quality analyses and to obtain\nunambiguous results. The classical calculation method using an 40 Ar/36 Ar atmospheric ratio\nmeasured on an air aliquot resulted in zero apparent ages for successive degassing steps,\nprobably as a result of an inadequate procedure for determining this ratio. The very high\nratio of the measured atmospheric to the radiogenic\n\n40\n\nAr favors use of isochron calculation\n\n(correlation method: 36 Ar/40 Ar versus 39 Ar\u2217 /40 ArK ; e.g. Turner (1971); Roddick et al. (1980);\nHanes et al. (1985)). This method does not require \"a priori\" knowledge of the measured\n40\n\nAr/36 Ar atmospheric ratio. Two argon components can be identified using this calculation\n\nmethod: the first one, related to the atmosphere, is usually weakly linked to the mineral;\nthe other one, supplied by radioactive decay of\n\n40\n\nAr, is trapped in minerals structures. The\n\naim of degassing by steps is to separate, at least partly, these two components, which allows\na mixing line to be defined, the isochron. In whole rock analysis, a meaningful isochron\nmust be calculated on a degassing segment which corresponds to the degassing of a specific\nmineral phase.\nAll analyzed samples display rather constant CaO/K2 O calculated ratios in the intermediate temperature range, around 11 (CaO/K2 O =\n\n37\n\nArCa /39 ArK \u00d72.179; Deckart et\n\nal. (1997)), which suggest degassing of a homogeneous phase, probably plagioclase as observed in thin sections. Very young calculated isochron ages (Fig. 9), concordant at the 2 \u03c3\nlevel, are obtained from the corresponding degassing steps (Table 4). They suggest that the\ntwo sampled lava flows with intermediate directions could be as young as 20-25 ka and the\nlava flow (am3) with the normal direction slightly older at ca 45 ka.\n\n\f14\n6\n\nCarvallo et al.\nDISCUSSION\n\n6.1\n\nReliability of paleointensity estimates\n\nThe determination of absolute paleointensity by the Thellier method imposes many constraints on rock magnetic properties which are often not respected in natural rocks. The\nfailure rate is usually around 70-90% (Perrin, 1998). We obtained results of very good technical quality for 50% of the samples in this study. Nevertheless a recent study carried out\non historical lava flows from Mount Etna showed that samples which fulfilled all the reliability criteria imposed by the authors could yield a paleointensity exceeding the real field\npaleomagnitude by as much as 25% (Calvo et al., 2002). It should never be forgotten that\nmeasurements of paleointensity are only estimates. Therefore we wish to discuss further the\nreliability of the paleointensity measurements performed in the present study.\nFirst, we can make sure that the part of NRM used must be a TRM. We compared continuous thermal demagnetization curves of NRM and artificial (total) TRM of sister samples\nmeasured using the thermal vibrating magnetometer. The artificial TRM was imparted in\nthe direction of the NRM. Samples have to be drilled in the direction of the NRM; therefore\nwe did this test only for 3 samples because we did not have enough material. A result is\nshown in Fig. 10. The remarkable similarity between the thermal demagnetization of the\nNRM and of the artificial TRM suggests that the NRM is a TRM and confirms the thermal\nstability of Amsterdam lava.\nThermal stability can be further tested independently by comparing the laboratory\nKoenigsberger ratios before and after heating. The ratio before heating is calculated according to the formula:\nQL =\n\nMnrm\n,\nka .Ha\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Mnrm is the natural remanent magnetization, ka is the bulk magnetic susceptibility\nmeasured before paleointensity experiments and Ha is the ancient field obtained from the\npaleointensity experiments. The ratio after heating is defined by:\nQ\u2032L =\n\nMtrm\n,\nkb .Hlab\n\n(3)\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n\n15\n\nwhere Mtrm is the total TRM obtained by extrapolation of the data corresponding to the\nhighest temperatures on the Arai plot, kb is the bulk magnetic susceptibility obtained after\nheating and Hlab is the laboratory field. We observed that the two Koenigsberger ratios\nhave similar values for the samples that gave reliable paleointensity results (Table 5). This\nsuggests that these samples are thermally stable.\nThe hysteresis parameters (Fig. 5 and Table 2) show that all the samples have a behavior\ncharacteristic of PSD grains. In natural samples, this is usually interpreted as the indication\nof a mixture of SD-PSD and MD grains. We found that one of the advantages of performing the pTRM-tail-test over measuring hysteresis parameters is to allow us to discriminate\nbetween MD, PSD and SD thermomagnetic behavior. This test qualifies directly the TRM\nbehavior, contrary to the hysteresis curves which make tests on remanent or induced magnetizations of isothermal origin. Moreover, it seems that measurement of hysteresis parameters\nas a function of temperature sometimes does not allow detection of changes in domain structure with heating (Carvallo & Dunlop, 2001). We note in Fig. 5 that the accepted samples\n(black dots) generally have higher Mrs/Ms than the rejected samples (white dots). Thus, on\naverage the better samples for paleointensity are a little smaller in effective magnetic grain\nsize.\n\n6.2\n\npTRM-tail-test : A new tool for paleointensity experiments ?\n\nThe main methodological originality of the present study is the use of pTRM-tail tests to select the most suitable portion of the NRM-TRM diagrams. Many authors (e.g., Shcherbakova\net al. (2000)) have suggested that recognizing the multidomain component in the paleointensity experiment is critical for the exactitude of the final result. The presence of multidomain\ngrains will invalidate the Thellier method if the unblocking temperature does not equal\nthe blocking temperature any more. Using the part of the Arai plot derived from multidomain behavior can thus lead to large errors in the paleointensity measurement. For example,\nShcherbakov & Shcherbakova (2001) showed that, if one were to ignore the continuous\ncurvature and fit a line to low temperature data points of synthetic, purely MD samples,\n\n\f16\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\none could overestimate the true value by as much as 60%. For the majority of the samples that we tested, the relative tails A(T1 , T2 ) are very large when pTRM is imparted\nat low-temperatures (300\u25e6 C-Troom and 400\u25e6 C-300\u25e6 C), but become smaller and smaller for\nhigher temperature intervals Table 2, which led us to reject all points acquired below 400\u25e6 C\nin calculating the paleointensities. Shcherbakova et al. (2000) as well as Shcherbakov &\nShcherbakova (2001) also observed a diminution of the pTRM tail with increasing temperature intervals, using both natural and synthetic samples.\nIn our case, this behavior could be explained in several ways.\n(i) Our natural samples are composed of a mixture of grains having different sizes. It is\npossible that the MD part of the remanence carriers have lower Curie temperature, whereas\nPSD and SD grains carry the high-temperature remanence (Dunlop & \u00d6zdemir, 2001). A\nsimplified explanation of what is observed with the variations of A parameters is that mainly\nMD grains are magnetized when they are given a low temperature pTRM (< 400\u25e6 C), yielding high A values. For high temperature pTRMs (> 400\u25e6 C), mainly PSD/SD grains are\nmagnetized and give very small tails. Another indication of the presence of MD material\ncan be extracted from the pTRM acquisition curve: when the field is switched off during\nthe cooling, the magnetic moment drops because of the presence of induced magnetization\nwhich is more important for MD than SD grains. For example, the pTRM (500\u25e6 C,400\u25e6 C)\nacquired by sample 680 has a large tail (60%), and the magnetic moment drops of about\n50% when the field is switched off at 400\u25e6 C (Fig. 7). But for sample 675, which has a tail for\nthe pTRM(550\u25e6 C, 500\u25e6 C) of only 2.2%, the drop when the field is switched off is also much\nsmaller (about 10% of the remanence acquired at this temperature). This is a general trend\nobserved for the ensemble of the pTRM acquisitions-demagnetizations (Fig. 11), although a\nmore precise correlation is difficult to establish.\n(ii) Alternatively, one could argue that for the samples having high Curie points, the high\nvalues of the low temperature pTRM tails might be only due to the fact that the pTRMs\nacquired in these intervals are actually very low. The difference between the magnetic moment measured after acquisition of a small pTRM and the magnetic moment measured after\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n\n17\n\nits demagnetization might then not be significant of any physical process but only reflect an\nartifact created by the accuracy of the measurement. However, the ranges of magnetization\nmeasured are in most cases well above the sensitivity of the vibrating magnetometer, so we\ncan be quite confident that the measured values of A in Table 2 are physically meaningful.\nFrom a practical point of view, the pTRM-tail test was not critical for these Amsterdam\nbasalt samples. Before knowing the A(T1 ,T2 ) values, we selected samples and temperature\nsteps for estimating paleointensity from our Thellier data using conventional criteria \u2013i.e.,\nessentially items i-iv described above in section 4.3. The flow-mean values thus obtained do\nnot differ significantly from those obtained by adding further data selection according to the\npTRM-tail test. In retrospect, this is not unexpected because, the selected samples have 57\nto 91% (on average 81%) of their TRM remaining after thermal demagnetization to 400\u25e6 C.\nThus, the pTRM tails of the low-temperature points are too small to have an appreciable\neffect on the slope of the best-fit lines of the Arai diagrams, that is, on the paleointensity\nestimate. More difficult to understand is the low-temperature slope of sample 680 which\nhave more than 30% of its remanence below 400\u25e6 C. Its multidomain-size pTRM tails would\nlead one to expect slope corresponding to large overestimated of paleointensity, but actually\nthat for 680 is too low by 33%. At this time we have no explanation for the departure of\nthis sample from the behavior expected for multidomain grains (Dunlop & \u00d6zdemir, 2001;\nShcherbakov & Shcherbakova, 2001).\n\n6.3\n\nImplication for the excursional field characteristics\n\nStudies carried out on absolute paleointensity during the Brunhes period show generally a\ndecrease of the VDM value when the colatitude of the VGP increases. This trend is illustrated in Fig. 12a in which we gathered Brunhes VDMs from the paleointensity database\nPINT2000 using as the unique selection criteria the Thellier paleointensity method. The\nVDM obtained in the present study, showing approximately a ratio of 2 between the normal\nand the excursional field, fit well in this general tendency. In Fig. 12b, we have randomly\ngenerated 500 VDMs from the statistical model of Camps & Pr\u00e9vot (1996) for fluctuations\n\n\f18\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\nin the geomagnetic field, using the model parameters proposed for the Icelandic data set.\nIn this model, the local field vector is the sum of two independent sets of vectors: a normally distributed axial dipole component plus an isotropic set of vectors with a Maxwellian\ndistribution that simulates secular variation. It is worth pointing out that the trend in the\nexperimental VDMs for the Brunhes period is very well reproduced in this statistical model.\nWe do note that this simulation also predicts some outliers data \u2013 high VDMs corresponding to excursional VGPs \u2013 as it sometimes observed in the Brunhes experimental data set\n(Fig. 12a) and as has been also recently reported for a mid Miocene excursion recorded in\nCanary Island lavas (Leonhardt et al., 2000).\nAbnormal VGPs from the Amsterdam excursion tend to group over the Caribbean Sea\n(Fig. 13). The question of whether this cluster represents a long-lived transitional state of\nthe field or is an artifact due to a rapid extrusion of successive lavas must be addressed.\nFirst, Watkins & Nougier (1973) concluded from geological field observations that Amsterdam excursion seems to correspond to two successive departures of the VGPs from the\npresent geographic pole which recorded very similar VGP locations. They argued that one\nof the excursional flow (their flow 24) belongs to the old volcanic episode whereas all the\nother excursional flows (their flows 13,17-19), although they yield a similar abnormal direction, are part of a more recent volcanic phase. We know from experience that stratigraphic\ncorrelations are often speculative in volcanic area, hence we find their argument quite weak.\nHowever we have no reason to rule out their conclusion since we did not carry out a field analysis. Next, we note that one of the excursional VGP from the Laschamp event (Fig. 13b)\nhas also a location within the Amsterdam cluster. Finally, we point out that Camps et\nal. (2001) have described a Plio-Pleistocene normal-transitional-normal excursion recorded\nin lava flows from Possession Island, a volcanic island located in the southern India ocean\n2300 km southwestward from Amsterdam. Interestingly, this excursion is characterized by a\nclustering of transitional VGPs also located in the vicinity of the Caribbean Sea (Fig. 13c).\nAlthough this excursion is not radiometrically dated, we are certain from geological considerations that it is older than the Amsterdam excursion . Thus, the transitional field of at\n\n\fMono Lake or Laschamp geomagnetic event\n\n19\n\nleast two distinct excursions would have revisited the same VGP location. These observations suggest that the Amsterdam excursional cluster may represents a recurring preferred\nlocation for transitional VGPs like that was previously proposed (Hoffman, 1992).\nAt present, the Ar/Ar isotopic ages suggest that the Amsterdam excursion corresponds\nto a late Pleistocene excursion. During this period, two geomagnetic events are described in\nthe literature. It concerns the Mono Lake excursion, documented in several lacustrine sedimentary sections from the western USA, which is dated to \u224828 14 C ka (Liddicoat, 1992), and\nthe Laschamp excursion, described for the first time in lava flows from La chaine des Puys,\nMassif Central France, and dated to \u2248 42 ka (see Kent et al. (2002) for a review). If evidences\nfor the Laschamp excursion are found in numerous deep-sea sediment records, this is not the\ncase for the Mono Lake which is only described jointly with Laschamp from high deposition\nrate sediments in the North Atlantic (Nowaczyk & Antonow, 1997; Laj et al., 2000). At the\npresent time, the existence of two geomagnetic excursions in the late Pleistocene is directly\nquestioned by Kent et al. (2002). Using new 14 C dates on carbonates and 40 Ar/39 Ar sanidine\ndates on ash layers, they concluded that Mono Lake excursion at Wilson Creek should be\nregarded as a record of the Laschamp excursion. Unfortunately, the large error bars associated with ours ages estimate for the Amsterdam excursion do not allow to bring insight\ninto this debate. We point out here that our preferred hypothesis, taking into account the\nage of 26\u00b115 and 18\u00b19 ka obtained for Amsterdam excursional flows, is to correlate this\nexcursion with a geomagnetic event younger than 30 Ka which could correspond to Mono\nLake if we consider the former age estimate of 28 Ka (Liddicoat, 1992). This conclusion\nrequires however a further confirmation with a more accurate age control, but if it is true,\nAmsterdam excursion would represent firm evidence for a global occurrence of Mono Lake\nexcursion. Finally, it is interesting to point out that the original record of Mono Lake excursion at Wilson Creek (Liddicoat & Coe, 1979) shows, as the Amsterdam excursion seems to\ndo, two successive excursional loops (Fig. 13a).\n\n\f20\n7\n\nCarvallo et al.\nCONCLUSIONS\n(i) We have identified an excursion of the geomagnetic field in the late Pleistocene recorded\n\nin volcanic rocks from Amsterdam Island, Indian Ocean. Good quality alternating field\ndemagnetization results show that two flows have excursional polarities with VGP latitudes\nof 15.2\u25e6 and 21.2\u25e6, and two flows have normal polarities (VGP latitudes are 85.5\u25e6 and 77.4\u25e6).\n(ii)\n\n40\n\nAr/39 Ar dating did not enable us to precisely specify which excursion we identified.\n\nMono Lake is the most likely, but the large error bars in the final dates do not exclude the\npossibility for theses rocks to have recorded the Laschamp excursion. Indeed, some authors\nbelieve the two excursions are the same (Kent et al., 2002)\n(iii) High-quality paleointensity determinations show low VDM values for the excursional\nflows (3.7\u00d71022 Am2 and 3.4\u00d71022 Am2 ), whereas normal flows have VDMs close to the\npresent-day VDM (6.2\u00d71022 Am2 and 7.7\u00d71022 Am2 ). These low values are in agreement\nwith other VDMs determinations during excursions in the Brunhes period and corroborates\nthe fact that the VDM decreases when the colatitude of VGP increases.\n(iv) For the first time, pTRM-tail-tests from above were used as a selection criteria for the\npaleointensity determinations. We found that most of our samples exhibit a tail characteristic\nof MD material for pTRMs given at low temperature and SD-like for high-temperature\npTRMs. Therefore we rejected measurements acquired at low-temperature (> 400\u25e6 C) for\nthe best-fit on the Arai plots.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to the \"Institut Polaire Paul Emile Victor\" for providing all transport\nfacilities and for the support of this project.

(1983). The confidence intervals for the Curie temperatures indicate the temperature\nrange in which the KT curve correspond to a straight line. MDF is the Median Destructive\nalternating Field in mT; Mrs /Ms and Hcr /Hc are the hysteresis parameters; A values are\nthe relative intensities measured at room temperature of the pTRM tail expressed in\npercent A(T1 , T2 ) = tail[pTRM(T1 , T2 )]/pTRM(T1 , T2 ). B values shown in parentheses\ncorrespond to the percent of the total pTRM (e.g.,\n\nP\n\ni pTRMi )\n\neach pTRM(T1 ,T2 )\n\nrepresents; intensities are measured at room temperature. nd means not determined. Note\nthat sample 674 broke itself before the acquisition of the pTRM(550-500) was completed.\nThus, we were not able to calculate B values for this sample.\n\n\f40\n\nCarvallo et al.\n\nTable 3.
