De Freitas\n\nEver since the operator product expansion formalism was applied to the analysis of deep inelastic scattering (DIS), there has been a lot of interest in the calculation of massive operator matrix\nelements at higher order in perturbation theory. Heavy flavor corrections to DIS structure functions\nare very important at small values of the Bjorken variable x (where they contribute on the level\nof 20\u201340%), and can be calculated in the limit Q2 \u226b m2 as a convolution of the corresponding\nmassive operator matrix elements and the light flavor Wilson coefficients [2]. Here Q2 denotes the\nvirtuality of the gauge boson exchanged in DIS and m is the mass of the heavy quark.\nThe scaling violations of the heavy flavor part in the structure functions F2,L (x, Q2 ) are very\ndifferent from those of the light flavor contributions, and their knowledge is very important for\nprecision measurements of \u039bQCD and the extraction of light parton densities. A semi-analytic\ncalculation of the heavy flavor contributions was done in Ref. [3] at next-to-leading order for the\nfull kinematic range, and a fast numerical implementation in Mellin space was given in [4]. Full\nanalytic results in the asymptotic region Q2 \u226b m2 for the structure function F2QQ\u0304 (x, Q2 ) at O(\u03b1s2 )\nwere derived in Ref. [2], and recently recalculated in [5]. In the same kinematic region, FLQQ\u0304 (x, Q2 )\nwas obtained at O(\u03b1s3 ) in Ref. [6].\nThe O(\u03b1s3 ) massive operator matrix elements are required in both cases and all but\nO((m2 /Q2 )k ), k > 1 contributions are found. In this approximation, the structure function F2 (x, Q2 )\nturns out to be very well described for Q2 > 20GeV2 , while for FL (x, Q2 ) this approximation only\nholds at large scales Q2 > 1000 GeV2 .\nMore recently, there has been considerable progress in the calculation of the O(\u03b1s3 ) heavy\nflavor contributions to the Wilson coefficients of the structure function F2 (x, Q2 ) and the massive\ngluonic operator matrix elements. First, in Ref. [7] the O(\u03b1s2 \u03b5 ) corrections to these matrix elements were given. These corrections are required to perform the corresponding renormalization\nprocedure at O(\u03b1s3 ). Later, the calculation of these contributions for a number of fixed moments\nN = 2...10(12, 14) at O(\u03b1s3 ) has also been achieved in [8], and O(\u03b1s3 n f ) contributions were given\nin Ref. [9]. O(\u03b1s2 ) and O(\u03b1s3 ) heavy flavor contributions to transversity have also been obtained in\n[10].\nOn the other hand, massive operator matrix elements, and in particular those with a massive\nexternal fermion line, can also be applied to a different kind of problem, namely, the calculation of\ninitial state QED corrections of scattering processes, such as e+ e\u2212 annihilation into a virtual gauge\nboson, using the renormalization group technique. A wealth of information about the Standard\nModel has been obtained in the past from electron\u2013positron colliding beam experiments at different\nfacilities around the world. In the future, projects like ILC [11] and CLIC [12] are planned to put\nthe Standard Model to even more decisive tests and to reveal new physics [13]. In this context\nhigh-luminosity machines which operate at a narrow energy regime as DAFNE [14] and GIGA-Z\n[11, 13] at the Z-peak will offer much higher precision on rare processes.\nThe QED initial state radiation causes large corrections for various differential and integral\nscattering cross sections, depending on the sensitivity of the sub\u2013system cross section with respect\nto kinematic rescaling of variables and has to be known at sufficient precision. Both for e+ e\u2212\nannihilation at resonance peaks and the wings of resonances at very high luminosities, the knowledge of the O(\u03b1 2 ) corrections is mandatory to cope with the experimental precision. While the\nO(\u03b1 ) corrections are known for a large amount of reactions, the corrections beyond the universal\n2\n\n\fTwo-loop massive fermionic OME's in QED\n\nA. De Freitas\n\ncontributions O((\u03b1 L)k ), 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5, see [15, 16], to higher orders, were only calculated once at\ntwo-loop order in Ref. [1]. Besides the logarithmic orders O(\u03b1 2 L2 , \u03b1 2 L) with L = ln(s/m2e ) and\nme the electron mass, the constant terms O(\u03b1 2 ) are of interest.\nThe renormalization group technique allows to decompose the scattering cross section \u03c3 (e+ e\u2212\n\u2192 V ), V = \u03b3 \u2217 , Z \u2217 into massive operator matrix elements and massless Wilson coefficients. The\nfermion mass effects are contained in the former, while the sub-system hard scattering cross sections are calculated for massless particles. The corresponding massless Wilson coefficients are\nknown from the literature [17, 18] for the Drell-Yan process. In [1] this method was used to derive\nall terms up to O(\u03b1 2 L) in addition to the direct calculation.\nThe differential scattering cross section can be written in the limit s \u226b m2e as a sum of three\ncontributions [1]:\nd \u03c3eI+ e\u2212 d \u03c3eII+ e\u2212 d \u03c3eIII\nd \u03c3e+ e\u2212\n+ e\u2212\n=\n+\n+\n,\n(1)\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nds\nds\nds\nds\u2032\nwhere the labels I, II and III refer to the flavor non-singlet terms with a single fermion line, those\nwith an additional closed fermion line, and the pure-singlet terms, respectively.

Here we present the missing ingredient needed to\ncomplete the decomposition of the scattering cross section according to Eqs. (4\u20136), namely, the\nO(\u03b1 2 ) massive operator matrix elements.

We need the\ninclusion of some counterterm diagrams in the case of process I. The electron mass is renormalized\non-shell, p2 = m2e , with p the momentum of the external fermion, which means that no collinear\nsingularities will appear.\nThe wave function renormalization was performed using the Z-factors coming from the fermion\nself-energy, see Fig. 1. Since we have a massive fermion in the external legs, the coupling constant\nwas first obtained in the MOM-scheme, after which we transform to the MS scheme using\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nme\n4\nMOM\nMS\nMS 2\nMS 3\na\n= a + ln\na\n+O a\n.\n(8)\n3\n\u03bc2\n\nWe perform the calculation in D = 4 + \u03b5 dimensions.

As it was mentioned before,\nin order to renormalize the corresponding OMEs for this process, we need to include also the\ncounterterm diagrams shown in Fig. 3, where the black stars represent the counterterm vertices in\nQED. The diagrams are calculated using the standard Feynman rules for the operator insertions, and\nprojecting the resulting numerators in the integrands with the factor (6 p + m)/4, after which we take\nthe trace. The program FORM [21] was used to decompose the diagrams as a linear combination\nof integrals with different powers of propagators, which arise after canceling as many terms as\npossible in the numerator against the propagators. The most complicated integrals appearing in\nthe expressions are those where all five propagators are present. These can be computed using\nintegration by parts identities to express them in terms of 4-propagator integrals. The resulting\nintegrals were checked by several means, including their representation in terms of Mellin-Barnes\nintegrals, cf. [19].\nThe constant contributions to process I in Eq.

(15)\n3\nOur calculations show explicitly that the operator matrix elements satisfy the relations given\nin Eqs. (9\u201311) for the pole terms, which automatically guarantees that the decomposition given in\nEqs. (4\u20136) holds for the logarithmic terms, as found in Ref. [1]. Furthermore, we have verified\nthat the first moment of the operator matrix elements vanishes, including the constant terms given\nin Eqs. (13-15), so they obey fermion number conservation as they should. This provides a highly\nnon-trivial check of our results. However, when we assemble the final result for the constant terms\nin Eqs. (4\u20136) by including the massless Wilson coefficients, we observe that, although many of\nterms appearing in Ref. [1] appear in our results, a few structural terms, such as terms proportional\nto 1/(1 \u2212 x)3 and ln(x)/(1 \u2212 x)4 , also appear, which were not present in the result given in [1].\nThis result appears in contrast to the case of massless external fermions and boson lines, where the\ncorresponding cross sections have been shown to factorize, including the constant terms, as can\nbe seen in Refs. [2, 3, 5, 6, 23]. The issue requires further investigation in order to elucidate the\nreasons for this.\n\nReferences\n[1] F. A. Berends, W. L. van Neerven and G. J. H. Burgers, Nucl. Phys.
