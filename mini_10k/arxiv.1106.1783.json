The famous\nmathematicians Friedrichs (1955) and Segel (1966) said that an asymptotic\ndescription is not only a suitable instrument for the mathematical analysis\nof nature but that it also has an additional deeper intrinsic meaning, and\nthat the asymptotic approach is more than just a mathematical technique;\nit plays a rather fundamental role in science. And here it appears that\nthe many existing asymptotic methods comprise a set of approaches that\nin some way belong rather to art than to science. Kruskal (1963) even introduced special term \"asymptotology\" and defined it as the \"art of dealing\nwith applied mathematical systems in limiting cases\". Here it should be\nnoted that he called for a formalization of the accumulated experience to\nconvert the art of asymptotology into a science of asymptotology.\nAsymptotic methods for solving mechanical and physical problems have\nbeen developed by many authors. We can mentioned the excellent monographs by Hinch (1991), Kevorkian and Cole (1996), Miller (2006), Nayfeh\n(1981, 2000), van Dyke (1975a,b), Verhulst (2005), and many others. The\nmain feature of the present book can be formulated as follows: it deals\nwith new trends and applications of asymptotic approaches in the fields\n\n2\n\n\fof Nonlinear Mechanics and Mechanics of Solids. It illuminates the developments in the field of asymptotic mathematics from different viewpoints,\nreflecting the field's multidisciplinary nature. The choice of topics reflects\nthe authors' own research experience and participation in applications. The\nauthors have paid special attention to examples and discussions of results,\nand have tried to avoid burying the central ideas in formalism, notations,\nand technical details.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSome Nonstandard Perturbation Procedures\nChoice of Small Parameters\n\nThe choice of the asymptotic method and the introduction of small dimensionless parameters in the system is very often the most significant and\ninformal part of the analytical study of physical problems. This should\nhelp the experience and intuition, analysis of the physical nature of the\nproblem, experimental and numerical results. It often dictated by physical\nconsiderations, is clearly shown as dimensionless and scaling. However, it is\nsometimes advantageous to use is not obvious, and perhaps even strange at\nfirst glance, the initial approximation. To illustrate this, consider a simple\nexample (Bender et al., 1998): algebraic equation\nx5 + x = 1.\n\n(1)\n\nWe seek the real root of Eq. (1), the exact value of which can be determined\nnumerically: x = 0.75487767 . . . . A small parameter \u03b5 is not included\nexplicitly in Eq. (1). Consider the various possibilities of introducing a\nparameter \u03b5 in Eq. (1).\n1. We introduce a small parameter \u03b5 with a nonlinear term of Eq. (1)\n\u03b5x5 + x = 1,\n\n(2)\n\nand present x as a series of \u03b5\nx = a0 + a1 \u03b5 + a2 \u03b5 2 + . . . .\n\n(3)\n\nSubstituting the series (3) into Eq. (2) and equating terms of equal\npowers, we obtain\na0 = 1, a1 = \u22121,\na6 = 23751.\n\na2 = 5,\n\na3 = \u221235,\n\n3\n\na4 = 285,\n\na5 = \u22122530,\n\n\fThese values can be obtained by a closed expression for the coefficients an :\n(\u22121)n (5n)!\nan =\n.\nn!(4n + 1)!\n4\n\nThe radius R of convergence of the series (3) is R = 545 = 0.08192.\nConsequently, for \u03b5 = 1 series (3) diverges very fast, so the sum of\nthe first six terms is 21476. The situation can be corrected by the\nmethod of Pad\u00e9 approximants (see Sect. 2). Constructing a Pad\u00e9\napproximant with three terms in the numerator and denominator and\ncalculating it with \u03b5 = 1, we obtain the value of the root x = 0.76369\n(the deviation from the exact value is 1.2%).\n2. We now introduce a small parameter \u03b5 near the linear term of Eq. (1)\nx5 + \u03b5x = 1.\n\n(4)\n\nPresenting the solution of Eq. (4) in the form\nx(\u03b5) = b0 + b1 \u03b5 + b2 \u03b52 + . . . ,\n\n(5)\n\nwe have, after applying the standard procedure of perturbation method\nb0 = 1, b1 = \u22121,\n21\n78\nb6 = 78125\n.\n15625 ,\n\n1\n,\nb2 = \u22121 25\n\n1\na3 = \u22121 125\n,\n\nb4 = 0,\n\nb5 =\n\nAnd in this case we can construct a general expression for the coefficients with:\n\u0393 [(4n \u2212 1)/5]\n,\nbn = \u2212\n5\u0393 [(4 \u2212 n)/5] n!\n\nand determine the radius of convergence of the series (4): R =\n= 1, 64938 . . . . The value of x(1), taking into account the first\nsix terms of the series (5), deviates from the exact by 0.07%.\n3. We introduce the \"small parameter\" \u03b4 in the exponent\n5\n\n4(4/5)\n\nx1+\u03b4 + x = 1,\n\n(6)\n\nx = c0 + c1 \u03b4 + c2 \u03b4 2 + . . . .\n\n(7)\n\nand represent x in the form\n\nIn addition, we use the expansion:\nx1+\u03b4 = x(1 + \u03b4 ln |x| + . . . ).\n\n4\n\n\fCoefficients of the series (7) are determined easily:\nc0 = 0.5,\n\nc1 = 0.25 ln 2,\n\nc2 = \u22120.125 ln 2,\n\n....\n\nThe radius of convergence is one in this case, and calculate when it\nshould be \u03b4 = 4. Using Pad\u00e9 approximants with three terms in the numerator and denominator, if \u03b5 = 1, we find x = 0.75448 that only deviates from the exact by 0.05% result. Calculating ci for i = 0, 1, . . . , 12\nand constructing Pad\u00e9 approximant with six terms in the numerator and denominator, we find x = 0.75487654 (0.00015% error). The\nmethod is called \"the method of small delta\" (see Sect. 2.3).\n4. We now assume the exponent as a large parameter. Consider the\nequation\nxn + x = 1.\n(8)\nAssuming n \u2192 \u221e (a method of large \u03b4, see Sect. 2.4), we represent\nthe desired solution in the form\n\u00151/n\n\u0014\n1\n(1 + x1 + x2 + . . . )\nx=\n,\n(9)\nn\nwhere 1 > x1 > x2 > . . . ..\nSubstituting the ansatz (9) in Eq. (8) and taking into account that\n\n1\n1\nln n + . . . , x1/n = 1 + ln(1 + x1 + x2 + . . . ) + . . . ,\nn\nn\none obtains in order of increasing accuracy of the formula\n\u00131/n\n\u0012\nln n\n,\n(10)\nx \u2248\nn\nn1/n = 1 +\n\nx\n\n\u2248\n\n\u0012\n\nln n \u2212 ln ln n\nn\n\n\u00131/n\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n... .\nFor n = 2 formula (10)\n\u221a gives x = 0.58871; the error compared to the\nexact solution (0.5( 5 \u2212 1) \u2248 0.618034) is 4.7%. When n = 5, we\nobtain x = 0.79715 from Eq. (10) (from the numerical solution one\nobtains x = 75488; error 4.4%). For n = 5, Eq. (11) gives x = 0.74318\n(error 1.5%). Thus, even the first terms of the large \u03b4 asymptotics give\nexcellent results.\nHence, in this case the method of large delta provides already a\ngood accuracy at low orders of perturbation method. Approximation\n(10), (11) give an example of nonpower asymptotics.\n\n5\n\n\f2.2\n\nHomotopy Perturbation Method\n\nIn recent years the so-called homotopy perturbation method was popular (Liao, 2004) (term \"method of artificial small parameters\" is also used).\nIts essence is as follows. In the equations or boundary conditions a parameter \u03b5 is introduced so that for \u03b5 = 0 one obtains a BVP which admits\na simple solution, and for \u03b5 = 1 one obtains the governing BVP. Then\nthe perturbation method to \u03b5 is apllied and in the resulting solution was\nadopted. Of course, it is not new and was already used by Giacaglia (1972,\nchapt. I.6) Liapunov (1893) and Poincar\u00e9 (1993). The novelty (and, in\nmy opinion, successful) is the title, emphasizing the continuous transition\nfrom the initial value \u03b5 = 0 to the value of \u03b5 = 1 (homotopy deformation). Let us analyse an example of homotopy perturbation parameter\nmethod using Andrianov and Danishevs'kyy (2002). A special feature of\nnonlinear systems with distributed parameters is the possibility of internal\nresonance between modes. That is why in many cases the neglection of\nhigher modes can lead to significant errors. The following describes the\nasymptotic method of solving problems of nonlinear vibrations of systems\nwith distributed parameters, allowing approximately to take into account\nall modes. The oscillations of a square membrane on a nonlinear elastic\nfoundation can be written as:\n\u22022w \u22022w \u22022w\n+\n\u2212 2 \u2212 cw \u2212 \u03b5w3 = 0,\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202t\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the dimensionless small parameter (\u03b5 \u226a 1).\nThe BCs are as follows:\nw|x=0,L = w|y=0,L = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nThe desired periodic solution must satisfy the periodicity conditions\nw(t) = w(t + T ),\n\n(14)\n\nwhere T = 2\u03c0\n\u03c9 is the period, and \u03a9 is the natural frequency of oscillation. We\nseek the natural frequencies corresponding to these forms of fundamental\nvibration frequencies at which the linear case (\u03b5 = 0) is realized by one\nhalf-wave in each direction x and y.

System (23) can be solved by reduction. However, a sufficiently large number of retention equations beging to\n\n7\n\n\fshow significant computational difficulties. In addition, this approach does\nnot take into account the influence of higher oscillation modes. Therefore,\nfurther we use the homotopy perturbation method.\nOn the right side of each (m, n)-th equation of system (23) we introduce\nthe parameter \u03bc to those members of Ai,j Ak,l Ap,s , for which the following\ncondition is valid: (i > m) \u222a (k > m) \u222a (p > m) \u222a (j > n) \u222a (l > n) \u222a (s > n).\nThus, for \u03bc = 0 system (23) takes the \"triangular\" appearance, and for\n\u03bc = 1 it returns to its original form. Next, we seek a solution in the form\nof expansions:\n\u03c91\nAm,n\n\n= \u03c9 (0) + \u03bc\u03c9 (1) + \u03bc2 \u03c9 (2) + . . . ,\n(1)\n2 (2)\n= A(0)\nm,n + \u03bcAm,n + \u03bc Am,n + . . . ,\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nwhere m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , (m, n) 6= (1, 1).\nWe put \u03bc = 1. This approach allows us to keep any number of equations\nin system (23). Below we limit ourselves the first two terms in the expansions\n(24), (25). We analyze the solutions and note that in this problem the\nparameter c plays the role of the bifurcation parameter. In general, for\nc 6= 0, c \u223c 1 , the system (23) admits the following solution:\nAi,j ,\n\u03c91 =\n\ni, j = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n27 A2m,n \u03c90\n,\n128 \u03c9m,n2\n\n(i, j) 6= (m, n),\n\nm, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\nAmplitude-frequency response is given by:\n\u03a9m,n = \u03c9m,n + 0.2109375\n\nA2m,n\n\u03b5 + ....\n\u03c9m,n\n\nOf particular interest is the case when the linear component of the restoring force is zero (c = 0) and the phenomenon of internal resonance between\nthe modes of oscillations occurs. Solving system (23) by the described\nmethod, we find\nAm,n = 0, m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , (m, n) 6= (1, 1), (m, n) 6= (2i \u2212 1, 2i \u2212 1),\ni = 1, 2, 3 . . . , A3,3 = \u22124.5662 * 10\u22123 A1,1 , A5,5 = 2.1139 * 10\u22125 A1,1 , . . . ,\n\u03c91 = 0.211048A21,1/\u03c90 .\nIf the oscillations are excited by the mode (1, 1) all odd modes (3, 3), (5, 5)\netc. are also realized. However, if the oscillations are excited by one of the\nhigher modes, the result of redistribution of energy modes appear at lower\norders until the fundamental tone (1, 1).\n\n8\n\n\f2.3\n\nMethod of Small Delta\n\nBender et al. (1998) proposed an effective method of small \u03b4, which we\nexplain by examples. Let us construct a periodic solution of the following\nCauchy problem\nxtt + x3 = 0,\n(26)\nx(0) = 1,\n\n(27)\n\nxt (0) = 0.\n\nWe introduce a homotopy parameter \u03b4 in Eq.

Then\nx2\u03b4 = 1 + \u03b4 ln x2 + 0.5\u03b4 2 ln x2\nWe suppose the solution of Eq.

After substituting ansatzes (29)-(31) into Eq. (28) and splitting\nit with respect to \u03b4, we obtain the following recurrent sequence of Cauchy\nproblems:\nx0\u03c4 \u03c4 + x0 = 0,\n(32)\nx0 (0) = 1,\n\nx2\u03c4 \u03c4\n\nx0\u03c4 (0) = 0;\n\n(33)\n\nx1\u03c4 \u03c4 + x1 = \u2212x0 ln(x20 ) \u2212 \u03b11 x0\u03c4 \u03c4 ,\n\n(34)\n\nx1 (0) = x1\u03c4 = 0;\n\u00012\n+ x2 = \u2212x1 ln(x21 ) \u2212 2x1 \u2212 x0 ln(x20 ) \u2212 \u03b12 x0\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b11 x1\u03c4 \u03c4 ;\n\n(35)\n\nx1 (0) = x1\u03c4 = 0;\n....\n\n9\n\n(36)\n(37)\n\n\fA Cauchy problem of the zero approximation (32), (33) has the solution .\nx0 = cos \u03c4.\nIn a first approximation, one obtains\nx1\u03c4 \u03c4 + x1 = \u2212 cos \u03c4 ln(cos2 \u03c4 ) + \u03b11 cos \u03c4 \u2261 L0 .\nThe condition of the absence of the secular terms in the solution of this\nequation can be written as follows:\nZ\u03c0/2\nL0 cos t dt = 0,\n0\n\nwhich is determined by the constant \u03b11 = 1 \u2212 2 ln 2. The expression for the\noscillation period can be written as\nT = 2\u03c0[1 + \u03b4(ln 2 \u2212 0.5)].\nFor \u03b4 = 1, we have T = 6.8070, while the exact value is T = 7.4164\n(the error of approximate solutions is 8.2%). The solution of the Cauchy\nproblems of the next approximation (36),(37) gives the value of the period,\nit practically coincides with the exact one (T = 7.4111).\nWe now consider the wave equation\n(38)\n\nutt = uxx ,\nwith nonlinear BCs:\nu(0, t) =\n\n0,\n\n(39)\n\n3\n\n0.\n\n(40)\n\nux (1, t) + u(1, t) + u (1, t) =\n\nWe introduce the parameter \u03b4 in Eq.

Comparison of exact and approximate solutions.\nThus, the first approximation of the asymptotics for n \u2192 \u221e already\ngives quite acceptable accuracy for practical purposes, even for not very\nlarge values of n. Note that the expression (72) gives an approximation\nof incomplete beta function (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965, Sect.6) from\nn = 1 (sinus function) to n = \u221e (linear function).\n\n15\n\n\f2.5\n\nApplication of Distributions\n\nAsymptotic methods are based, generally speaking, on the use of Taylor\nseries. In this connection the question arises: what to do with the functions\nof the form exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x), which cannot be expanded in a Taylor series in\n\u03b5 \u2192 0, using smooth functions (Peierls, 1979). The way out lies in the\ntransition to the following distribution (Estrada and Kanwal, 2002):\n\u221e\nX\n\nH(x) exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x) =\n\n(\u22121)n \u03b5n+1 \u03b4 (n) (x),\n\n(75)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere \u03b4(x) is the Dirac delta function, representing the derivative of the\nHeavisyde function H(x) in the theory of distribution; \u03b4 (n) (x), n = 1, 2, . . .\nare the derivatives of the delta function.\nWe show how formal the formula (75) can be obtained. Applying the\nLaplace transform to function exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x), one obtains:\nZ\u221e\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x) dx =\n\n\u03b5\n.\n\u03b5p + 1\n\n0\n\nExpanding the r.h.s. of this equation in a Maclaurin series of \u03b5, and then\ncalculating inverse transform term by term, one obtains expansion (75).\nThus, we again use the Taylor series, but now in the dual space.\nHere is another interesting feature of the approach using distributions:\na singular perturbated problem can be regarded as a regular perturbated\none (Estrada and Kanwal, 2002). Suppose, for example,\n\u03b5y \u2032 + y = 0\n\nx > 0,\n\ny = 1 at x = 0.\n\nThis is singular perturbated problem: for \u03b5 = 0 one obtains a smooth\nsolution y = 0, which does not satisfy the given initial condition. However,\none can seek a solution in the form of a nonsmooth function. Namely,\nassuming z(x) = H(x)y(x), one obtains\n\u03b5z \u2032 = \u2212z + \u03b5\u03b4(x).\n\n(76)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (76) is sought in the form of expansions\nz=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nzn \u03b5n .\n\nn=0\n\nAs a result, one obtains\nz0 = 0,\n\nz1 = \u03b4(x),\n\nzn+1 = (\u22121)n \u03b4 (n) ,\n\n16\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(77)\n\n\fNote that the expressions (77) can go to the smooth functions. To do this,\nit is possible to apply the Laplace transform, then the Pad\u00e9 approximants\nin the dual spase and then to calculate inverse Laplace transform.\nWe show other application of the asymptotic method using distribution.\nConsider the equation of the membrane, reinforced with fibers of the small,\nbut finite width \u03b5. The governing PDE is:\n[1 + 2\u03b5\u03a60 (y)]uxx + uyy = 0,\nwhere \u03a60 (y) =\n\n\u221e\nP\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n(78)\n\n[H(y + kb \u2212 \u03b5) + H(y \u2212 kb + \u03b5)].\n\nLet us expand the function \u03a60 (y) in a series of \u03b5. Applying the two-sided\nLaplace transform (van der Pol and Bremmer, 1987), one obtains:\n\n\u03a6\u0304(p, \u03b5) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\ne\u2212p|y| \u03a6(y, \u03b5) dy\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nExpanding the function \u03a6\u0304(p, \u03b5) in a series of \u03b5 and performing the inverse\nLaplace transform, we obtain\n\u03a60 (y) = 2\u03b5\u03a6(y) + 2\u03b5\n\nX\n\n\u03b5n \u03a6(n) (y),\n\n(79)\n\nk=1,3,5,...\n\nwhere \u03a6(y) =\n\n\u221e\nP\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b4(y \u2212 kb).\n\nNow let us consider the solution of the Eq. (78) in the form\nu = u0 + \u03b5u1 + \u03b52 u2 + . . . .\n\n(80)\n\nSubstituting ansatzes (79), (80) into Eq. (78) and splitting the resulting\nequation with respect to \u03b5, we arrive at the recursive sequence of BVPs\n[1 + 2\u03b5\u03a6(y)] u0xx + u0yy\n\n=\n\n0,\n\n[1 + 2\u03b5\u03a6(y)] u1xx + u1yy\n\n= \u2212\u03b5u0xx\u03a6y (y),\n...\n\n(81)\n(82)\n\nThus, in the zero approximation, we obtain the problem with one-dimensional\nfibers (81), the influence of the width of the filaments is taken into account\n\n17\n\n\fin the following approximations (82).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nSummation of Asymptotic Series\nAnalysis of Power Series\n\nWe suppose that one obtains the following series as a result of an asymptotic study:\n\u221e\nX\nf (\u03b5) \u223c\nCn \u03b5n for \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n(83)\nn=0\n\nAs it is known, the radius of convergence \u03b50 of series (83) is determined by\nthe distance to the nearest singularity of the function f (\u03b5) on the complex\nplane and can be found using the Cauchy-Hadamard formula:\n1\n1/n\n.\n= lim |Cn |\n\u03b50 n\u2192\u221e\nIf the nearest singularity lies on the positive real axis, then the coefficients\nCn have the usually one and the same algebraic sign, for example,\n1\n\u223c 1 + \u03b5 + \u03b52 + \u03b53 + . . . .\n1\u2212\u03b5\n\nIf the nearest singularity is located on the negative axis, the algebraic signs\nof the coefficients Cn are usually alternated, for example,\n1\n\u223c 1 \u2212 \u03b5 + \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 + . . . .\n1+\u03b5\nThe pattern of signs is usually set pretty quickly. If there are several features\nof the same radius, that could happen to a real function with complex\nsingularities necessarily occurring in complex conjugate pairs, then the rule\nof alternation of signs may be more complex, such as\n1+\u03b5\n\u223c 1 + \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 + \u03b54 + \u03b55 \u2212 \u03b56 \u2212 \u03b57 . . . .\n1 + \u03b52\nHere we have a pattern of signs ++\u2212\u2212. To define \u03b50 may it is useful to apply\nthe so-called Domb-Sykes plot (Hinch, 1991; van Dyke, 1974, 1975a,b).

The Domb-Sykes plot for f (\u03b5) = \u03b5(1 + \u03b5)(1 + 2\u03b5)\u22121/2 .\nIf \u03b50 or \u03b1 are known from physical considerations, they can be used\nfor the construction of the Domb-Sykes plot. If several singularities have\nthe same convergence radius, so that the signs of the coefficients oscillate,\n1/2\nyou can try to construct a dependence on the value (Cn /Cn\u22121 ) . If the\nradius of convergence tends to infinity and Cn /Cn\u22121 \u223c k/n, then the analyzed function has a factor exp(k\u03b5), when Cn /Cn\u22121 \u223c k/n1/p it has a factor\nexp(\u03b5p ). If the radius of convergence tends to zero, then the analyzed function has an essential singularity and asymptotic expansion diverge. If the\ncoefficients behave like Cn\u22121 /Cn \u223c 1/(kn) then we can write Cn \u223c Ck n n!,\nwhere C is a constant.\n\n19\n\n\fKnowledge of the singular solutions can eliminate them from the perturbation series and thus significantly improve its convergence. We describe\nsome techniques for removing singularities. If the singularity lies on the\npositive real axis, then it often means that the function f (\u03b5) is multivalued\nand that there is a maximum attainable point \u03b5 = \u03b50 . Then the inverse of\nthe original function \u03b5 = \u03b5(f ) can be single valued. For example, consider\nthe function\n1\n3\n5 7\nf (\u03b5) = arcsin \u03b5 = \u03b5 + \u03b53 + \u03b55 +\n\u03b5 + ...,\n6\n40\n112\n\n(85)\n\nthe inverse of this function is\n1\n1\n1 7\n\u03b5 \u223c f \u2212 f 3 + 20f 5 \u2212\nf + ... .\n6\n1\n5040\n\n(86)\n\nNumerical results are shown in Figure 2, where the solid line denotes the\nfunction arcsin \u03b5, the dotted and dashed line shows the n-term expansions\n(85) and k-terms expansions (86) for different numbers of terms.

An example of taking the root.\nIn addition, knowing the singularity, one can construct a new function\nfM (\u03b5) (multiplicative extraction rule)\nf (\u03b5) = (\u03b50 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b1 fM (\u03b5),\nor fA (\u03b5) (additive extraction rule)\nf (\u03b5) = A(\u03b50 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03b1 fA (\u03b5).\nThe functions fM (\u03b5) and fA (\u03b5) should not contain singularities at \u03b50 .\nIn many cases, one can effectively use the conformal transformation of the\n\n21\n\n\fseries, a fairly complete catalog of which is given in (Kublanovskaya., 1953).\nIn particular, it sometimes turns out to be a successful Euler transformation\n(Bellman, 1964; van Dyke, 1975a,b), based on the introduction of a new\nvariable\n\u03b5\n.\n(89)\n\u03b5\u0303 =\n1 \u2212 \u03b5/\u03b50\nP\nRecast the function f in terms of \u03b5\u0303 , f \u223c\ndn \u03b5\u0303n , has the singularity\npushed out at the point \u03b5\u0303 = \u221e.

It is only\n\n22\n\n\fnecessary to be able to retrieve it, and some of the ways to do this is to construct a Pad\u00e9 approximant\" (Vinogradov et al., 1987). Pad\u00e9 approximants\n(PA) allow us to implement among the most salient natural transformation\nof power series in a fractional rational function. Let us define a PA following\nBaker and Graves-Morris (1996).

(93),(94) are called Pad\u00e9 equations. In the case\nwhere the system (94) is solvable, one can obtain the Pad\u00e9 coefficients of\nthe numerator and denominator of the PA. Functions f[n/m] (\u03b5) at different\nvalues of n and m form a set, which is usually written in the form of a table,\ncalled the Pad\u00e9 table (Table 3):\nThe terms of the first row of the Pad\u00e9 table correspond to the finite sums\nof the Maclaurin series.

Pad\u00e9 table.\nmost common practice. Note that the Pad\u00e9 table can have gaps for those\nindices n, m, for which the PA does not exist. We note some properties of\nthe PA (Apresyan, 1979; Baker and Graves-Morris, 1996; Suetin, 2002):\n1. If the PA at the chosen m and n exists, then it is unique.\n2. If the PA sequence converges to some function, the roots of its denominator tend to the poles of the function. This allows for a sufficiently\nlarge number of terms to determine the pole, and then perform an\nanalytical continuation.\n3. The PA has meromorphic continuation of a given power series functions.\n4. The PA on the inverse function is treated the PA function inverse\nitself. This property is called duality and more exactly formulated as\nfollows. Let\nq(\u03b5) = f \u22121 (\u03b5) and f (0) 6= 0,\n\n\u22121\nthen q[n/m] (\u03b5) = f[n/m]\n(\u03b5), (96)\n\nprovided that one of these approximations there.\n5. Diagonal PA are invariant under fractional linear transformations of\nthe argument. Suppose that the function is given by their expansion\n(91). Consider the linear fractional transformation that preserves the\na\u03b5\norigin W = 1+b\u03b5\n, and the function q(W ) = f (\u03b5). Then q[n/n] , provided that one of these approximations exist. In particular, the diagonal PA is invariant concerning Euler transformation (89).\n6. Diagonal PA are invariant under fractional linear transformations of\nfunctions. Let us analyse a function (91). Let\nq(\u03b5) =\n\na + bf (\u03b5)\n.\nc + df (\u03b5)\n\nIf c + df (\u03b5) 6= 0, then\nq[n/n] (\u03b5) =\n\n24\n\na + bf[n/n] (\u03b5)\n,\nc + df[n/n] (\u03b5)\n\n\fprovided that there is f[n/n] (\u03b5). Because of this property infinite values\nof PA can be considered on a par with the end.\n7. The PA can get the upper and lower bounds for f[n/n] (\u03b5). For the\ndiagonal PA one has the estimate\nf[n/n\u22121] (\u03b5) \u2264 f[n/n] (\u03b5) \u2264 f[n/n+1] (\u03b5).\n\n(97)\n\nTypically, this estimate is valid for the function itself, i.e. f[n/n] (\u03b5)\nin Eq. (97) can be replaced by f (\u03b5) .\n8. Diagonal and close to them a sequence of PA often possess the property of autocorrection (Litvinov, 1994, 2003). It consists of the following. To determine the coefficients of the numerator and denominator\nof PA have to solve systems of linear algebraic equations. This is\nan ill-posed procedure, so the coefficients of PA can be determined\nwith large errors. However, these errors are in a certain sense of selfconsistency, the PA can approximate the searching function with a\nhigher accucary. This is a radical difference between the PA and the\nTaylor series.\nAutocorrection property is verified for a number of special functions. At\nthe same time, even for elliptic functions the so-called Froissart doublets\nphenomenon arises, consisting of closely spaced zeros and poles to each\nother (but different and obviously irreducible) in the PA. This phenomenon\nis not of numerical nature, but due to the nature of the elliptic function\n(Suetin, 2002). Thus, in general, having no information about the location\nof the poles of the PA, but relying solely on the PA (computed exactly as\nyou wish), we can not say that you have found a good approximation for\nthe approximated function.\nTo overcome these defects several methods are suggested, in particular,\nthe smoothing method (Beckermann and Kaliaguine, 1997). Its essence is\nthat instead of the usual-term diagonal PA for complex functions f[n/n] (\u03b5) =\npn (\u03b5)/qn (\u03b5) the following expression is used\nf[n/n] (\u03b5) =\n\nqn (\u03b5)pn (\u03b5) + qn\u22121 (\u03b5)pn\u22121 (\u03b5)\nqn (\u03b5)qn (\u03b5) + qn\u22121 (\u03b5)qn\u22121 (\u03b5)\n\nHere f denotes complex conjugation of f .\nNow consider the question: in what sense can the available mathematical results on the convergence of the PA facilitate the solution of practical\nproblems? Gonchar's theorem (Gonchar, 1986) states: if none of the diagonal PA f[n/n] (\u03b5) has poles in the circle of radius R, then the sequence\nf[n/n] (\u03b5) is uniformly convergent in the circle to the original function f (\u03b5).\nMoreover, the absence of poles of the sequence of the f[n/n] (\u03b5) in a circle\n\n25\n\n\fof radius R must be original and confirm convergence of the Taylor series\nin the circle. Since for the diagonal PA invariant under fractional linear\n\u03b5\nmaps we have \u03b5 \u2192 a\u03b5+b\n, the theorem is true for any open circle containing the point of decomposition, and for any area, which is the union of\nthese circles. A significant drawback in practice is the need to check all\ndiagonal PA. For example, the following theorem holds (Vyatchin, 1982):\nSuppose the sequence of diagonal Pad\u00e9 approximants of the function w(\u03b5),\nwhich is holomorphic in the unit disc and has no poles outside this circle.\nThen this sequence converges uniformly to w(\u03b5) in the disc |z| < r0 , where\n0.583R < r0 < 0.584R.\nHow can we use these results? Suppose that there are a few terms of the\nperturbation series and someone wants to estimate its radius of convergence\nR. Consider the interval [0, \u03b50 ], where the truncated perturbation series and\nthe diagonal PA of the maximal possible order differ by no more than 5%\n(adopted in the engineering accuracy of the calculations). If none of the\nprevious diagonal PA does not have poles in a circle of radius \u03b50 , then it is\na high level of confidence to assert that R \u2265 \u03b50 .\nThe procedure of constructing the PA is much less labor intensive than\nthe construction of higher approximations of the perturbation theory. The\nPA is not limited to power series, but to the series of orthogonal polynomials. PA is locally the best rational approximation of a given power series.\nThey are constructed directly on its odds and allow the efficient analytic\ncontinuation of the series outside its circle of convergence, and their poles\nin a certain sense localize the singular points (including the poles and their\nmultiplicities) of the continuation function at the corresponding region of\nconvergence and on its boundary. This PA fundamentally different from\nrational approximations to (fully or partially) fixed poles, including those\nfrom the polynomial approximation, in which case all the poles are fixed\nin one, infinity, the point. Currently, the PA method is one of the most\npromising non-linear methods of summation of power series and the localization of its singular points. Including the reason why the theory of the\nPA turned into a completely independent section of approximation theory,\nand these approximations have found a variety of applications both directly\nin the theory of rational approximations, and in perturbation theory. Thus,\nthe main advantages of PA compared with the Taylor series as follows:\n1. Typically, the rate of convergence of rational approximations greatly\nexceeds the rate of convergence of polynomial approximation. For example, the function e\u03b5 in the circle of convergence approximated by\nrational polynomials Pn (\u03b5)/Qn (\u03b5) in 4n times better than an algebraic\npolynomial of degree 2n. More tangible it is property for functions\nof limited smoothness. Thus, the function |\u03b5| on the interval [\u22121, 1]\n\n26\n\n\fcan not be approximated by algebraic polynomials, so that the order of approximation was better than 1/n, where n is \u221athe \u0001degree of\npolynomial. PA gives the rate of convergence \u223c exp \u2212 2n .\n2. Typically, the radius of convergence of rational approximation is a\nlarge compared with power series. Thus, for the function arctan(x)\nTaylor polynomials converge only if |\u03b5| \u2264 1, and AP - everywhere in\nC \\ ((\u2212i\u221e, \u2212i] \u222a [i, i\u221e)).\n3. PA can establish the position of singularities of the function.\nSimilarly, the PA method is a method of continued fractions (Jones and Thron,\n1980). There are several types of continued fractions. The regular Cfraction has the form of an infinite sequence, in which N -th term can be\nwritten as follows\nfN (\u03b5) = a +\n\nc0\n.\nc1 \u03b5\n1+\nc2 \u03b5\n1+\n1+\n..\n.\ncN +1 \u03b5\n1 + cN \u03b5\n\n(98)\n\nThe coefficients ci are obtained after the decomposition of expression\n(98) in a Maclaurin series and then equating the coefficients of equal powers\nof \u03b5. When a = 0 one obtains the fraction of Stieltjes or S-fraction. For the\nfunction of Stieltjes\nZ\u221e\nexp(\u2212t)\ndt,\nS(\u03b5) =\n1 + \u03b5t\n0\n\nthe coefficients of expansion (98) have the form: a = 0, c0 = 1, c2n\u22121 =\nc2n = n, n \u2265 1.\nDescription of the so-called J-, T-, P-, R-, g-fractions, algorithms for\ntheir construction and the range of applicability are described in detail in\nJones and Thron (1980).\nContinued fractions are a special case of continuous functional approximation (Bender and Orszag, 1978). This is the sequence in which the\n(n + 1)-th term cn (\u03b5) has the form n-th iteration of a function F (\u03b5). For\nthe Taylor series one obtains F (\u03b5) = 1 + \u03b5, for the continuous fraction\n1\nF (\u03b5) = 1+\u03b5\n. If F (\u03b5) = exp(\u03b5) one obtains a continuous exponential approximation\ncn (\u03b5) = a0 exp {a1 \u03b5 exp [a2 \u03b5 . . . exp (an \u03b5)]} ,\n\n27\n\n\ffor F (\u03b5) =\n\n\u221a\n\n1+\u03b5\n\ncn (\u03b5) = a0\n\ns\n\n1 + a1 \u03b5\n\nr\n\nq\n\u221a\n1 + a2 \u03b5 1 + . . . an\u22121 \u03b5 1 + an \u03b5,\n\nfor F (\u03b5) = ln 1 + \u03b5\ncn (\u03b5) = a0 ln {a1 \u03b5 ln [a2 \u03b5 . . . ln (an \u03b5)]} .\nIn some cases, such approximations can converge significantly faster than\npower series.\nAs an example, we note the solution of the transcendental equation\nx = \u03b5 ln x\nfor large values (Argatov, 2004, \u00a73.4.9)) \u03bb:\nx0 = \u03b5 ln \u03b5;\n\n4\n4.1\n\nx1 = \u03b5 ln(\u03b5 ln \u03b5);\n\nx2 = \u03b5 ln[\u03b5 ln(\u03b5 ln \u03b5)]; . . . .\n\nSome Applications of Pad\u00e9 Approximants\nAccelerating Convergence of Iterative Processes\n\nThe efficiency of PA or other methods of summation depends largely on\nthe availability of higher approximations of the asymptotic process. Sometimes they can be obtained by using computer algorithms (Miller, 2006),\nbut in general it remains an open question. Iterative methods are significantly easier to implement. As a result of an iterative procedure a sequence\nof Sn is obtained. Suppose that it converges and has the limit value. We\nintroduce the parameter a obtained by the ratio\nSn+1 \u2212 Sn\n.\nn\u2192\u221e Sn \u2212 S\n\na = lim\n\nIt's called superlinear convergence, if a = 0, a linear for a < 1 and\nlogarithmic at a = 1. The biggest issues are, of course, logarithmically\nconvergent sequences - alas, widespread practice. Very often linearly convergent sequences are also a problem. Therefore, it is often necessary to\nimprove the convergence. One method of improving the convergence is to\nmove to a new sequence Tn with the aid of a transformation so that\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nT n \u2212 Sn\n= 0.\nSn \u2212 S\n\n28\n\n\fIn such cases we say that the sequence Tn converges faster than sequence\nSn . There are linear and nonlinear methods to improve convergence. Linear\nmethods are described by formulas\nTn =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nani Si , n = 0, 1, 2, . . .\n\n0\n\nwhere the coefficients ani do not depend on the terms of the sequence Sn\nconstant.\nSince linear methods improve the convergence of a restricted class of\nsequences, currently nonlinear methods the most popular ones. Among\nthem thr Aitken method (Baker and Graves-Morris, 1996) stands out for\nits easiness, which described by the formula\nT n = Sn \u2212\n\n(Sn+1 \u2212 Sn ) (Sn \u2212 Sn\u22121 )\n,\nSn+1 \u2212 2Sn + Sn\u22121\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(99)\n\nThe Aitken method accelerates the convergence of all linear and many\nof logarithmically convergent sequences. It is very easy to calculate, and\nin some cases it can be applied iteratively. A natural generalization of the\nAitken transformation is the Shanks transformation (Shanks, 1955)\n(1)\n\nTpsh\n\n=\n\nDkp\n\n(1)\n\nDkp\n\n(100)\n\n,\n\nwhere\n(1)\nDkp\n\n(2)\nDkp\n\n=\n\nSp\u2212k\n\u2206Sp\u2212k\n...\n\u2206Sp\u22121\n\nSp\u2212k+1\n\u2206Sp\u2212k+1\n...\n\u2206Sp\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\nSp\n\u2206Sp\n...\n\u2206Sp+k\u22121\n\n,\n\n=\n\n1\n\u2206Sp\u2212k\n...\n\u2206Sp\u22121\n\n1\n\u2206Sp\u2212k+1\n...\n\u2206Sp\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n1\n\u2206Sp\n...\n\u2206Sp+k\u22121\n\n,\n\n\u2206Sk = Sk+1 \u2212 Sk\nEq. (100) is called the Shanks transformation of the order k of the\nsequences to the sequence Sk . For k = 1 one obtains the Aitken transform\n(99). Shanks method requires the calculation of determinants, which is not\n\n29\n\n\falways easy. One can use also Wynn algorithm, which described by the\nformulas:\n(n)\n\nT\u22121 = 0,\n\n(n)\n\nT0\n\n= Sn ,\n\n(n)\n\n(n+1)\n\nTk+1 = Tk+1\n\n+\n\n1\n(n+1)\nTk\n\n(n)\n\n\u2212 Tk\n\n(101)\n\n.\n\nThe Wynn algorithm is related to the transformation of Shanks (100) in the\nfollowing way:\n(n)\n\n(sh)\n\nT2k = Tk\n\n(Sn ),\n\n(n)\n\nT2k+1 =\n\n1\n(sh)\nTk\n\n(\u2206Sn ).\n\nThe Wynn algorithm is a quadratic convergent method for solving systems of nonlinear equations (Baker and Graves-Morris, 1996). There are\nmany other techniques for accelerating of sequences' convergence. One can\nuse them consistently, for example, to convert the original sequence into a\nlinearly convergent one, and then apply the method of Aitken. One can also\nuse different methods to improve convergence, at each stage by comparing\nthe obtained results (Brezinski, 2000). All the described methods have a\nclose relationship with the PA. The Aitken method corresponds to the PA\n[n/1] , the Shanks method to the PA [p/k], for the method of Wynn one\n(n)\nobtains T2k = [n + k/k].\n4.2\n\nRemoving Singularities and Reducing the Gibbs Effect\n\nConsider the problem of uniform plane flow of an incompressible inviscid\nfluid pasting a thin elliptic airfoil (|x| \u2264 1, |y| \u2264 \u03b5, \u03b5 \u226a 1). The expression\nfor the relative velocity q* of the flow is such (van Dyke, 1975b, \u00a74.4):\n\u221a\n(1 + \u03b5) 1 \u2212 x2\nq\n\u2217\n=p\n,\n(102)\nq =\nV\n1 \u2212 x2 (1 + \u03b52 )\n\nwhere V is the free-stream speed.\nThe splitting of the r.h.s. of Eq. (102) in a series of \u03b5 can be expressed\nas:\n1 3 x2\nx2\n1\n\u2212\n+ ... .\n(103)\n\u03b5\nq \u2217 (x, \u03b5) = 1 + \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b52\n2 1 \u2212 x2\n2 1 \u2212 x2\nThis expression diverges at x = 1. No wonder it is not: the expansion\n(103) is obtained as a result of the limiting process lim q(x, \u03b5), x > 1, and\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nto get the value of q(1, \u03b5), it is necessary to perform the limit as lim q(x, \u03b5)\nx\u21921\n\nfor \u03b5 > 0. Divergence of series (103) when x = 1 indicates that the limit\nprocesses cannot be interchanged. Now let us apply PA to the r.h.s. of Eq.\n\n30\n\n\f(103) and then pass to the limit x \u2192 1. After trying various options, we\nconclude that the best result is given by the PA\nq \u2217 (x, \u03b5) =\n\n(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 + \u03b5)\n.\n1 \u2212 x2\n\n(104)\n\nNumerical results for \u03b5 = 0.5 are shown in Figure 5, where the dashed\nline denotes the solution (103), curves 1 and 2 the exact solution (104)\nand the PA (104). It is seen that the use of PA significantly improves the\naccuracy of the approximate solution.\n\nFigure 5. Removing singularities by the PA.\nPA can be also successfully applied for the suppression of the Gibbs phenomenon (Beckermann et al., 2008; Brezinski, 2000; Driscoll and Fornberg,\n2001; Nemeth and Paris, 1985) . Consider, for example, the function sign x:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u22121, \u2212\u03c0 < x < 0,\nsign x =\n\uf8f3\n1,\n0 < x < \u03c0.\nIts Fourier series expansion has the form\nsign x =\n\n\u221e\n4 X sin(2j + 1)x\n\u03c0 j=0\n2j + 1\n\n31\n\n(105)\n\n\fDirect summation of series (105) leads to the Gibbs effect in the neighborhood of x = 0, while the defect of convergence reaches 18%, i.e. instead\nof 1 one obtains the value of 1.1789797 . . . . Diagonal PA for series (105)\ncan be written as follows:\n\nsign x[N/N ] =\n\nN \u22121/2\nP\n\nq2j+1 sin ((2j + 1)x)\n\nj=0\n\n1+\n\nN/2\nP\n\n(106)\ns2j cos(2jx)\n\nj=0\n\nwhere\nq2j+1\n\n=\n\n#\n\"\n[N/2]\nP\ns2i\n1\n4\n,\n+\n(2j + 1)\n2\n2\n\u03c0\n(2j + 1)2\ni=1 (2j + 1) \u2212 (2i)\n\ns2i\n\n=\n\n2(\u22121)i\n\n(N !)4 (2N + 2i)!(2N \u2212 2i)!\n.\n(N \u2212 1)!(N + 1)!(N \u2212 2i)!(N + 2i)![(2N )!]2\n\nNumerical studies show that the Gibbs effect for PA (106) does not\nexceed 2% (Nemeth and Paris, 1985).\n4.3\n\nLocalized Solutions\n\nWe consider the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u22072 (x, y) \u2212 u(x, y) + u3 (x, y) = 0.\n\n(107)\n\nWe seek the real, localized axisymmetric solutions of the Eq. (107). In polar\ncoordinates (\u03be, \u03b8) we construct a solution \u03c6(\u03be) which does not depend on \u03b8.\nAs a result, we obtain the BVP\n1\n\u03c6\u2032\u2032 (\u03be) + \u03c6\u2032 (\u03be) \u2212 \u03c6(\u03be) + \u03c63 (\u03be)\n\u03be\n\u03c6(x)\nlim \u03c6(\u03be)\n\u03be\u2192\u221e\n\n= 0,\n\n(108)\n\n= 0,\n= 0.\n\n(109)\n(110)\n\nBVP (108)-(110) can be regarded as an eigenvalue problem, and the role\nof an eigenvalue is an unknown quantity A = \u03c6(0). This problem plays an\nimportant role in nonlinear optics, quantum field theory, the theory of magnetic media. As shown in (Molotkov and Vakulenko, 1988, p.12-16), BVP\n(108)-(110) has a countable set of \"eigenvalues\" An , the solution \u03c6(\u03be, An )\nhas exactly n zeros, and the solution \u03c6(\u03be, A0 ) has no zeros and decreases\n\n32\n\n\fmonotonically on \u03be. That is the last solution, which is most interesting\nfrom the standpoint of physical applications, and we will concentrate on\nobtaining it.\nThe problem of computing the decaying solutions of BVP (108)-(110)\nis identical to the problem of computing homoclinic orbits in the 3D phase\nspace for the nonlinear oscillator, or equivalently, for computing the initial\nconditions for these orbits.\nSince the sought solutions are expected to be analytical functions of \u03be,\nthey can be expressed in Maclaurin series about \u03be = 0:\n\u03c6(\u03be) = A0 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nC2j \u03be 2j .\n\n(111)\n\nj=1\n\nSubstituting ansatz (111) into Eq. (108), producing a splitting of the\npowers of the \u03be and solving the relevant equations, one obtains (Emachi et al.,\n1997):\nC2 = 0.25A0 (1 \u2212 A20 ); C4 = 0.25C2 C\u0303;\n1\n(C\u0303C6 \u2212 6A0 C2 C4 \u2212 C23 );\n64\n\nC6 =\n\nC4\n3A20 C\u0303 2\n\u2212\n;\n6\n16\n\nC8 =\n\nC10 = \u22120.01(C\u0303C8 + 6A0 C2 C6 + 3A0 C42 + 3C22 C4 );\nC12 = \u2212\n\n1\n(\u2212C\u0303C10 + 6A0 C2 C8 + 6A0 C4 C6 + 3C2 c24 ),\n144\n\nwhere C\u0303 = 1 \u2212 3A20 .\nThen we construct PA for the truncated series (111)\nA0 +\n\nN\nP\n\na2j \u03be 2j\n\nj=0\n\n\u03c6(\u03be) =\n1+\n\nN\nP\n\n(112)\n\nb2j \u03be 2k\n\nk=1\n\nAll coefficients in Eq. (112) can be parameterized in terms of A0 , a2j =\na2j (A0 ), b2j = b2j (A0 ) and the PA becomes a one-parameter family of\nanalytical approximations of the searching solution. Then we compute the\nvalue of A0 for which PA (112) decays to zero as \u03be tends to infinity. It gives\nus condition\na2j (A0 ) = 0, b2j (A0 ) 6= 0,\n(113)\n\nOne can compute the PA (112) , then imposed the condition (113) and\nobtained the following convergent values of A0 for varying orders 2N :\n\n33\n\n\fN\nA0\n\n1\n\u221a\n\u00b1 3\n\n2\n\u00b12.20701\n\n3\n\u00b12.21121\n\n4\n\u00b12.21200\n\nThe numerical solution gives A0 \u2248 \u00b12.206208, the difference between\nnumerical and analytical solutions for N = 4 is 0.26%.\n4.4\n\nHermite-Pad\u00e9 Approximations and Bifurcation Problem\n\nPA can successfully work with functions having poles. However, it often\nbecomes necessary to explore functions with branch points, and construct\nall their branches. In that case, one can use Hermite-Pad\u00e9 approximations\n(Drazin and Tourigny, 1996). Suppose it comes to a function with the expansion\n\u221e\nX\nf (\u03b5) =\nu n \u03b5n ,\n(114)\nn=1\n\nand we managed to find the first few coefficients of this series\nfN (\u03b5) =\n\nN\nX\n\nu n \u03b5n .\n\nn=1\n\nIf it is known that this function has a branch point, we can try to transform\nthe original series (114) in an implicit function\nF (\u03b5, f ) = 0,\nand determine all required branches of it.\nFor this purpose we construct a polynomial Fp (\u03b5, f ) of degree p \u2265 2\nFp (\u03b5, f ) =\n\np X\nm\nX\n\nCm\u2212k,k \u03b5m\u2212k f k .\n\nm=1 k=0\n\nIt was assumed C0.1 = 1, and the remaining coefficients must be determined from the condition\nFp (\u03b5, fN (\u03b5)) = O(\u03b5N +1 ) at \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n\n(115)\n\nPolynomial Fp contains 0.5(p2 + 3p \u2212 2) unknowns, the condition (115)\nyields N linear algebraic equations, therefore, should N = 0.5(p2 + 3p \u2212 2).\nOnce the polynomial Fp is found, one can easily find p branches of the\nsolution from the equation\nFp = 0.\n\n34\n\n\fFor the analysis of bifurcations of these solutions one can use Newton's\npolygon (Vainberg and Trenogin, 1974). If a priori information about the\nsearching function is known, it can be taken into account for constructing\nthe polynomial Fp .\n4.5\n\nEstimates of Effective Characteristics of Composite Materials\n\nWe consider a macroscopically isotropic 2D composite material consisting of a matrix with inclusions. The aim is to determine the effective conductivity q from the known matrix (q1 ) and inclusions (q2 ) conductivities\nand the volume fraction (\u03c6).

(125) have the form (120).\n4.7\n\nRational interpolation\n\nHere we follow (Floater and Hormann, 2007). A simple way to approximate a function is to choose a sequence of points\na = x0 < x1 < x2 * * * < xn = b,\nand to construct the interpolating polynomial pn (x)\npn (xi ) = f (xi ),\n\ni = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n.\n\nHowever, as is well-known pn (x) may not be a good approximation to f ,\nand for large n \u226b 1 it can exhibit wild oscillations. If we are free to choose\nthe distribution of the interpolation points xi , one remedy is to cluster them\nnear the end-points of the interval [a, b], for example using various kinds of\nChebyshev points.\nSowe have to make do with them, and then we need to look for other\nkinds of interpolants. A very popular alternative nowadays is to use splines\n(piecewise polynomials), which have become a standard tool for many kinds\nof interpolation and approximation algorithms, and for geometric modeling.\nHowever, it has been known for a long time that the use of rational functions\ncan also lead to much better approximations than ordinary polynomials. In\nfact, both, polynomial and rational interpolation, can exhibit exponential\nconvergence when approximating analytic functions. In \"classical\" rational\ninterpolation, one chooses some M and N such that M + N = n and fits\n\n37\n\n\fa rational function of the form pqM\nto the values f (xi ), where pM and qN\nN\nare polynomials of degrees M and N respectively. If n is even, it is typical\nto set M + N = n2 , and some authors have reported excellent results. The\nmain drawback, though, is that there is no control over the occurrence of\npoles in the interval of interpolation.\nBerrut and Mittelmann (1997) suggested that it might be possible to\navoid poles by using rational functions of higher degree. They considered\nalgorithms which fit rational functions whose numerator and denominator\ndegrees can both be as high as n. This is a convenient class of rational interpolants because every such interpolant can be written in so-called barycentric form\nn\nP\n\u03bbi\nf (xi )\nx \u2212 xi\nr(x) = i=0\nn\nP\n\u03bbi\nf (xi )\nx\n\u2212\nxi\ni=0\nfor some real values \u03bbi . Thus it suffices to choose the weights \u03bbi in order\nto specify r, and the idea is to search for weights which give interpolants r\nthat have no poles and preferably good approximation properties. Various\napproach is described in Floater and Hormann (2007), in particular, one\ncan choose \u03bbi = (\u22121)i , i = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n.\n\n4.8\n\nSome Other Applications\n\nPA is widely used for the construction of solitons and other localized\nsolutions of nonlinear problems, even in connection with the appeared term\n\"padeon\" (Lambert and Musette, 1984, 1986). As a simple model, we consider the nonlinear BVP\ny \u2032\u2032 \u2212 y + 2y 3 = 0,\n\ny(0) = 1,\n\ny(\u221e) = 0,\n\n(126)\n(127)\n\nthat has an exact localized solution\ny = cosh\u22121 (x)\nQuasilinear asymptotics give a solution in the following form:\n\u0001\ny = Ce\u2212x 1 \u2212 0.25C 2 e\u22122x + 0.0625C 4e\u22124x + . . . , C = const.\n\n(128)\n\n(129)\n\nIt is easy to verify that with reconstructing the truncated series (129) in the\nPA and to determine the constant C from the BCs (127) and we arrive at\nthe exact solution (128).\n\n38\n\n\fIt is also interesting to use the PA to the problems with the phenomenon\nof \"blow-up\", when the solution goes to infinity at a finite value of the\nargument. For example, the Cauchy problem\ndx\n= \u03b1x + \u03b5x2 ,\ndt\n\nx(0) = 1,\n\n0 < \u03b5 \u226a \u03b1 \u226a 1,\n\n(130)\n\nhas the exact solution\nx(t) =\n\n\u03b1 exp(\u03b1t)\n,\n\u03b1 + \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 exp(\u03b1t)\n\n(131)\n\nwhich tends to infinity for t \u2192 ln[(\u03b1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5].\nRegular asymptotic expansion\nx(t) \u223c exp(\u03b1t) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\u22121 exp(\u03b1t)[1 \u2212 exp(\u03b1t)] + . . .\ncan not describe this phenomenon, but the use of the PA gives the exact\nsolution (131).\nPA allows to expand the scope of the known approximate methods. For\nexample, in the method of harmonic balance the representation of the solution of a rational function of the type\n\nx(t) =\n\nN\nP\n\nn=0\n\n{An cos[(2n + 1)\u03c9t] + Bn sin[(2n + 1)\u03c9t]}\n\n1+\n\nN\nP\n\nn=0\n\n{Cm cos(2m\u03c9t) + Dm sin(2m\u03c9t)}\n\nsubstantially increases the accuracy of approximation (Handy, 1985; Mickens,\n1986). PA can be used effectively to solve ill-posed problems. This could include reconstruction of functions in the presence of noise (Gilewicz and Pindor,\n1997, 1999), various problems of dehomogenization (i.e., determining the\ncomponents of a composite material on its homogenized characteristics)\n(Cherkaev and Ou, 2008), etc. We must also mention 2D PA (Vavilov et al.,\n2002).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nMatching of Limiting Asymptotic Expansions\nMethod of Asymptotically Equivalent Functions for Inversion of Laplace Transform\n\nThis method was originally proposed by Slepian and Yakovlev for the\ntreatment of integral transformations. Here is a description of this method,\n\n39\n\n\ffollowing Slepyan and Yakovlev (1980). Suppose that the Laplace transform\nof a function of a real variable f (t) is:\nF (s) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\nf (t)e\u2212st ds.\n\n0\n\nTo obtain an approximate expression for the inverse transform, it is\nnecessary to clarify the behavior of the transform the vicinity of the points\ns = 0 and s = \u221e and determine the nature and location of its singular\npoints are on the exact boundary of the regularity or near it. Then the\ntransform F (s) replaced by the function F0 (s), allowing the exact inversion\nand satisfying the following conditions:\n1. Functions F0 (s) and F (s) are asymptotically equivalent at s \u2192 \u221e and\ns \u2192 0, i.e.\nF0 (s) \u223c F (s)\n\nat s \u2192 0\n\nand s \u2192 \u221e.\n\n2. Singular points of the functions F0 (s) and F (s), located on the exact\nboundary of the regularity, coincide.\nThe free parameters of the function F0 (s) are chosen in such a way that\nthey satisfy the conditions of the approximate approximation of F (s) in the\nsense of minimum relative error for all real values s \u2265 0:\n\u001a\n\u001b\nF0 (s, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1k )\nmin max\n\u22121 .\n(132)\nF (s)\nCondition (132) is achieved by variation of free the parameters \u03b1i . Often\nthe implementation of equalities\nZ\u221e\n\nF0 (s) ds =\n\n0\n\nZ\u221e\n\nF (s) ds\n\n0\n\nor F0\u2032 \u223c F0\u2032 at s \u2192 0 leads to a rather precise fulfillment of the requirements\n(132). Constructed in such a way the function is called asymptotically\nequivalent function (AEF).\nHere is an example of constructing AEF. Find the inverse transform if the\nLaplace transform is the modified Bessel function (Abramowitz and Stegun,\n1965, Sect.9):\nK0 (s) = \u2212 ln(s/2)I0 (s) +\n\n40\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\ns2k\n\u03a8(k + 1)\n22k (k!)2\n\n(133)\n\n\fwhere \u03a8(z) is the psi (digamma) function (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965,\nSect.6).\nFor pure imaginary values of the argument s(s = iy; 0 < |y| < \u221e)\nfunction K0 (s) has no singular points. Consequently, we can restrict the\nstudy of its behavior for s \u2192 0 and s \u2192 \u221e. The corresponding asymptotic\nexpressions are (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965, Sect.9):\nh s\ni\nK0 (s) = \u2212 ln + \u03b3 + O(s),\ns \u2192 0,\n2\n(134)\nr\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n1\n\u03c0 \u2212s\n, s \u2192 \u221e,\ne\n1+O\nK0 (s) =\n2s\ns\nwhere \u03b3 is the Euler's constant (\u03b3 = 1, 781 . . . ) (note the typo in the first\nformula (134) in Slepyan and Yakovlev (1980)).\nThe analyzed Laplace transform has a branch point of the logarithmic\ntype, branch point of an algebraic type, and an essential singularity. These\nsingular points need to be stored in the structure of the zero approximation.\nThe most simple way to obtain such a structure, combining two asymptotic\nrepresentations (134) so that they are mutually do not distort each other\nand contain free parameters, which could be disposed of in the future. As\na result, we arrive at the zero approximation\nr\n\u0014\n\u0015\ns+\u03b1\n\u03c0\n1\n\u2212s\n\u221a\nln\nF0 (s) = e\n,\n(135)\n+\ns\n2 s+\u03b2\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the free parameters.\nIt is easy to see that expression (135) has the correct asymptotic behavior s \u2192 \u221e. The free parameters are determined from the condition of\ncoincidence of the asymptotics of the functions K0 (s) and F0 (s) for s \u2192 0\nand the equality of integrals\nZ\u221e\n0\n\nF0 (s) ds =\n\nZ\u221e\n\nK0 (s) ds.\n\n0\n\nAs a result of calculations one obtains a system of transcendental equations\nr\n\u03c0\n= ln 2 \u2212 \u03b3;\nln \u03b1 +\n2\u03b2\n\u221a \u0001\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03c0\nln \u03b1 \u2212 e\u03b1 Ei(\u2212\u03b1) + \u03b3 + \u221a e\u03b2 1 \u2212 erf 2\n2\n\n41\n\n=\n\n\u03c0\n,\n2\n\n\fwhere Ei(. . . ) is the the sine integral (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965, Sect.5),\nerf(. . . ) is the the error function (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1965, Sect.7)\n(note typo in these formulas in Slepyan and Yakovlev (1980)).\nSolving the prescription system numerically, one finds \u03b1 = 0.3192, \u03b2 =\n0.9927.\nThen the approximate inverse transform can be written as follows:\nf0 (t) =\n\n(\n\n1 \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03b1(t \u2212 1)] exp[\u2212\u03b2(t \u2212 1)]\n+ p\nt\u22121\n2(t \u2212 1)\n\n)\n\nH(t \u2212 1).\n\n(136)\n\nThe exact expression for the function f (t) is:\n\n1\nH(t \u2212 1)\nf (t) = \u221a\n2\nt \u22121\n\n(137)\n\nComparison of exact (137) (solid line) and approximate (136) (dotted line\nwith circles) inversions is shown in Figure 7. As it can be seen, a satisfactory\nresult is obtained even in the zero approximation. Analogously, one can\n\nFigure 7.

The\nmost difficult in terms of the asymptotic approach is the intermediate case\nof \u03b5 \u223c 1. In this domain numerical methods typically work well, however, if\nthe task is to investigate the solution depending on the parameter \u03b5, then it\nis inconvenient to use different solutions in different areas. Construction of\na unified solution on the basis of limiting asymptotics is not a trivial task,\nwhich can be summarized as follows: we know the behavior of functions in\nzones I and III (Figure 8), we need to construct it in the zone II. For this\npurpose one can use a two-point Pad\u00e9 approximants (TPPA). We give the\ndefinition following Baker and Graves-Morris (1996).

Exact and approximate Laplace transform inversion.\n\n5.3\n\nOther Methods of AEFs Constructiong\n\nUnfortunately, the situations where both asymptotic limits have the form\nof power expansions are rarely encountered in practice, so we have to resort\nto other methods of AEFs constructing. Consider, for example, the BVP\n\u03b5yxx \u2212 xy = \u03b5y,\n\ny(0) = 1,\n\ny(\u221e) = 0, \u03b5\n\n\u226a 1.\n\n(145)\n\nSolution for small values of x can be written as follows:\n1\ny = 1 \u2212 a\u03be + \u03be 3 + O(\u03be 4 )\n6\n\n(146)\n\n1\n\nwhere \u03be = x\u03b5\u2212 3 , a is the arbitrary constant.\nThe solution for large values of x is constructed using the WKB method\n(Nayfeh, 2000)\ny = b\u03be\n\n\u2212 41\n\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0001\n5 \u22123\n2 3\n\u22123\n1\u2212 \u03be 2 +O \u03be\nexp \u2212 \u03be 2\n3\n48\n\n(147)\n\nwhere b is an arbitrary constant.\nNow we match these asymptotics. Because of the exponential in Eq.\n(147) using TPPA in the original form is not possible. Therefore, we construct AEF, based on the following considerations: for large values of the\nvariable \u03be exponent from Eq. (147) is taken into account in its original\nform, and for small values of the variable \u03be it is expanded in a Maclaurin\n\n46\n\n\fseries. Constructed in this way AEF has the form\n2 3\n2 5\n32\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2212 a\u03be + \u03be 2 \u2212 \u03be 2 + a\u03be 4\n2 3\n3\n3\n5\n2\nya =\nexp \u2212 \u03be\n32 a 17\n3\n\u03be4\n1+\n5 b\n\n(148)\n\nThe coefficients a and b in Eq. (148) still remain uncertain. For calculation\nof these constants one can use some integral relations, for example, obtained\nfrom Eq. (148) by multiplying them with the weighting functions 1, x, x2 , . . .\nand further integration over the interval [0, \u221e). In the end, such values of\nthe constants are found:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\u0393\n9\u0393\n3\n3\n\u0012 \u0013 , b=\n\u221a\n(149)\na=\n2\n2 \u03c0\n\u0393\n3\nNumerical calculations show that the formula (148) with constants (149)\napproximates the desired solution in the whole interval [0, \u221e) with an error\nnot exceeding 1.5%.\nWhen choosing the constants one can use other methods, then a lot\ndepends on the skill of the researcher. Of course, it is necessary to ensure\nthe correct qualitative behavior of AEFs, avoiding, for example, do not\ncorrespond to the problem of zeros of the denominator. To do this, one\ncan vary the number of terms in the asymptotics and the numerator and\ndenominator constructed uniformly suitable solutions. In general form the\nmethod of rational AEF can be described as follows (Martin and Baker,\n1991). Let us assume that function f (z) has the following asymptotics:\nf (z) = F (z) at z \u2192 \u221e,\nand\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nci z i\n\ni=0\n\nat z \u2192 0.\n\n(150)\n\n(151)\n\nThen the AEF can be produced from the Eqs. (152), (153) as follows:\n\nf (z) \u2248\n\nm\nP\n\ni=0\nn\nP\n\n\u03b1i (z)z i\n\u03b2i (z)z i\n\nat z \u2192 0.\n\n(152)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere \u03b1i , \u03b2i are considered not as constants but as some functions of z.\nFunctions \u03b1i (z) and \u03b2i (z) are chosen in such a way that:\n\n47\n\n\f1. the expansion of AEF (152) in powers of z for z \u2192 0 matches the\nperturbation expansion (151);\n2. the asymptotic behavior of AEF (152) for z \u2192 \u221e coincides with the\nfunction F (z) (150).\nIn the construction of AEFs a priori qualitative information is very important. For example, if from any considerations it is known that the unknown function is close to the power, you can use the method of Sommerfeld\n(Kashin et al., 1989).

Let us emphasize, that the composite equations, due to van Dyke (1975b), can be\nobtained in result of synthesis of the limiting cases. The principal idea of\nthe method of the composite equations can be formulated in the following\nway (van Dyke, 1975b, p.195):\n1. Identify the terms in the differential equations whose neglect in the\nstraightforward approximation is responsible for the nonuniformity.\n2. Approximate those terms insofar as possible while retaining their essential character in the region of nonuniformity.\nLet's dwell on the terminology. Here we use the term \"asymptotically\nequivalent function\". Other terms (\"reduced method of matched asymptotic\nexpansions\" (Kashin et al., 1989), \"quasifractional approximants\" (Chalbaud and Martin,\n1992), \"mimic function\" (Gaunt and Guttman, 1974, p.181\u2013243) also used.\n5.4\n\nExample: Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\n\nFor the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (60) with boundary conditions (61) previously we obtained a solution for the exponent, little different from the two\n\n48\n\n\f(68).

Here we consider three types of\nspace arrangement of spheres, namely, the simple cubic (SC), body centered\ncubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC) arrays. The constants ai for\nthese arrays are given in Table 6.\nSC array\nBCC array\nFCC array\n\na1\n1.305\n0.129\n0.0753\n\na2\n0.231\n\u22120.413\n0.697\n\na3\n0.405\n0.764\n\u221207.41\n\na4\n0.0723\n0.257\n0.0420\n\na5\n0.153\n0.0113\n0.0231\n\na6\n0.0105\n0.00562\n9.14 * 10\u22127\n\nTable 6. The constants a1 , . . . , a6 in Eq. (157).\nIn the case of perfectly conducting large spheres (c \u2192 cmax , where cmax\nis the maximum volume fraction for a sphere) the problem can be solved\nby means of a reasonable physical assumption that the heat flux occurs\nentirely in the region where spheres are in a near contact. Thus, the effective\nconductivity is determined in the asymptotic form for the flux between two\nspheres, which is logarithmically singular in the width of a gap, justifying\nthe assumption (McPhedran and Milton, 1981):\nhki = \u2212M1 ln \u03c7 \u2212 M2 + O(\u03c7\u22121 ),\n\u0010\n\n(158)\n\n\u0011 31\n\nc\nis the dimensionless width of a gap between the\nwhere \u03c7 = 1 \u2212 cmax\nneighboring spheres, \u03c7 \u2192 0 for c \u2192 cm , M1 = 0.5cmax p, p is the number of\ncontact points at the surface of a sphere; M2 is a constant, depending on\nthe type of space arrangement of spheres. The values of M1 , M2 and cmax\nfor the three types of cubic arrays are given in Table 7.\nOn the basis of limiting solutions (157) and (158) we develop the AEF\nvalid for all values of the volume fraction of inclusions c \u2208 [0, cmax ]:\nm+1\n\nP1 (c) + P2 c 3 + P3 ln \u03c7\nhki =\n,\nQ(c)\n\n(159)\n\nHere the functions P1 (c), Q(c) and the constants P2 , P3 are determined as\nfollows:\n\n50\n\n\fSC array\nBCC array\nFCC array\n\nM1\n\u03c0/2\n\u221a\n3\u03c0/2\n\u221a\n0 2\u03c0\n\nM2\n0.7\n2.4\n7.1\n\ncmax\n\u221a\u03c0/6\n\u221a3\u03c0/8\n2\u03c0/6\n\nTable 7.

Let us illustrate this dependence in the case of\nSC array. We calculated hki for different values of m and n. In the Figure\n10 our analytical results are compared with experimental measurements\nfrom Meredith and Tobias (1960) (black dots). Details of these data can be\nfound in McPhedran and McKenzie (1978). Finally, we restrict m = 19 and\nn = 2 for all types of arrays, as they provide a satisfactory agreement with\nnumerical datas and a rather simple analytical form of the AEF (159).\nNumerical results for the BCC and the FCC arrays are displayed in\nFigures 11 and 12 respectively. For BBC array the obtained AEF (159)\n\u03b1j = \u2212\n\n52\n\n\fis compared with the experimental results from McKenzie and McPhedran\n(1977) and McKenzie et al. (1978). For FCC array the experimental data\nare not available, therefore we are comparing with the numerical results\nobtained by McKenzie et al. (1978) using the Rayleigh method. The agreement between the analytical solution (159) and the numerical results is quite\nsatisfactory.\n\nBibliography\nM. Abramowitz and I. A. Stegun.

Andrianov* , H. Topol*\n*\n\nInstitute of General Mechanics, RWTH Aachen University, D-52062 Aachen ,\nGermany\nAbstract In this lectures various methods which give a possibility\nto extend an area of applicability of perturbation series and hence to\nomit their local character are analysed. While applying asymptotic\nmethods as a rule the following situation appears: the existence of\nasymptotics for \u03b5 \u2192 0 implies an existence of the asymptotics for\n\u03b5 \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, the idea to construct one function valid for the\nwhole parameter interval for \u03b5 is very attractive. The construction\nof asymptotically equivalent functions possessing a known asymptotic behaviour for \u03b5 \u2192 0 and \u03b5 \u2192 \u221e will be discussed. Using\nsummation and interpolation procedures we focus on continuous\nmodels derived from a discrete micro-structure.

The famous mathematicians ? and ? said that an asymptotic description is not\nonly a suitable instrument for the mathematical analysis of nature but that\nit also has an additional deeper intrinsic meaning, and that the asymptotic\napproach is more than just a mathematical technique; it plays a rather\nfundamental role in science. And here it appears that the many existing\nasymptotic methods comprise a set of approaches that in some way belong\nrather to art than to science. ? even introduced special term \"asymptotology\" and defined it as the \"art of dealing with applied mathematical systems\nin limiting cases\". Here it should be noted that he called for a formalization\nof the accumulated experience to convert the art of asymptotology into a\nscience of asymptotology.\nAsymptotic methods for solving mechanical and physical problems have\nbeen developed by many authors. We can mentioned the excellent monographs by ?, ?, ?, ??, ??, ?, and many others. The main feature of the\npresent book can be formulated as follows: it deals with new trends and\napplications of asymptotic approaches in the fields of Nonlinear Mechanics and Mechanics of Solids. It illuminates the developments in the field of\nasymptotic mathematics from different viewpoints, reflecting the field's multidisciplinary nature. The choice of topics reflects the authors' own research\n\n2\n\n\fexperience and participation in applications. The authors have paid special\nattention to examples and discussions of results, and have tried to avoid\nburying the central ideas in formalism, notations, and technical details.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nSome Nonstandard Perturbation Procedures\nChoice of Small Parameters\n\nThe choice of the asymptotic method and the introduction of small dimensionless parameters in the system is very often the most significant and\ninformal part of the analytical study of physical problems. This should\nhelp the experience and intuition, analysis of the physical nature of the\nproblem, experimental and numerical results. It often dictated by physical\nconsiderations, is clearly shown as dimensionless and scaling. However, it is\nsometimes advantageous to use is not obvious, and perhaps even strange at\nfirst glance, the initial approximation. To illustrate this, consider a simple\nexample (?): algebraic equation\nx5 + x = 1.\n\n(1)\n\nWe seek the real root of Eq. (1), the exact value of which can be determined\nnumerically: x = 0.75487767 . . . . A small parameter \u03b5 is not included\nexplicitly in Eq. (1). Consider the various possibilities of introducing a\nparameter \u03b5 in Eq. (1).\n1. We introduce a small parameter \u03b5 with a nonlinear term of Eq. (1)\n\u03b5x5 + x = 1,\n\n(2)\n\nand present x as a series of \u03b5\nx = a0 + a1 \u03b5 + a2 \u03b5 2 + . . . .\n\n(3)\n\nSubstituting the series (3) into Eq. (2) and equating terms of equal\npowers, we obtain\na0 = 1, a1 = \u22121,\na6 = 23751.\n\na2 = 5,\n\na3 = \u221235,\n\na4 = 285,\n\na5 = \u22122530,\n\nThese values can be obtained by a closed expression for the coefficients an :\n(\u22121)n (5n)!\nan =\n.\nn!(4n + 1)!\n4\n\nThe radius R of convergence of the series (3) is R = 545 = 0.08192.\nConsequently, for \u03b5 = 1 series (3) diverges very fast, so the sum of\n\n3\n\n\fthe first six terms is 21476. The situation can be corrected by the\nmethod of Pad\u00e9 approximants (see Sect. 2). Constructing a Pad\u00e9\napproximant with three terms in the numerator and denominator and\ncalculating it with \u03b5 = 1, we obtain the value of the root x = 0.76369\n(the deviation from the exact value is 1.2%).\n2. We now introduce a small parameter \u03b5 near the linear term of Eq. (1)\nx5 + \u03b5x = 1.\n\n(4)\n\nPresenting the solution of Eq. (4) in the form\nx(\u03b5) = b0 + b1 \u03b5 + b2 \u03b52 + . . . ,\n\n(5)\n\nwe have, after applying the standard procedure of perturbation method\nb0 = 1, b1 = \u22121,\n78\n21\nb6 = 78125\n.\n15625 ,\n\n1\nb2 = \u22121 25\n,\n\n1\na3 = \u22121 125\n,\n\nb4 = 0,\n\nb5 =\n\nAnd in this case we can construct a general expression for the coefficients with:\n\u0393 [(4n \u2212 1)/5]\n,\nbn = \u2212\n5\u0393 [(4 \u2212 n)/5] n!\n\nand determine the radius of convergence of the series (4): R =\n= 1, 64938 . . . . The value of x(1), taking into account the first\nsix terms of the series (5), deviates from the exact by 0.07%.\n3. We introduce the \"small parameter\" \u03b4 in the exponent\n5\n\n4(4/5)\n\nx1+\u03b4 + x = 1,\n\n(6)\n\nx = c0 + c1 \u03b4 + c2 \u03b4 2 + . . . .\n\n(7)\n\nand represent x in the form\n\nIn addition, we use the expansion:\nx1+\u03b4 = x(1 + \u03b4 ln |x| + . . . ).\nCoefficients of the series (7) are determined easily:\nc0 = 0.5,\n\nc1 = 0.25 ln 2,\n\nc2 = \u22120.125 ln 2,\n\n....\n\nThe radius of convergence is one in this case, and calculate when it\nshould be \u03b4 = 4. Using Pad\u00e9 approximants with three terms in the numerator and denominator, if \u03b5 = 1, we find x = 0.75448 that only deviates from the exact by 0.05% result. Calculating ci for i = 0, 1, . . . , 12\n\n4\n\n\fand constructing Pad\u00e9 approximant with six terms in the numerator and denominator, we find x = 0.75487654 (0.00015% error). The\nmethod is called \"the method of small delta\" (see Sect. 2.3).\n4. We now assume the exponent as a large parameter. Consider the\nequation\nxn + x = 1.\n(8)\nAssuming n \u2192 \u221e (a method of large \u03b4, see Sect. 2.4), we represent\nthe desired solution in the form\n\u0014\n\u00151/n\n1\nx=\n(1 + x1 + x2 + . . . )\n,\n(9)\nn\nwhere 1 > x1 > x2 > . . . ..\nSubstituting the ansatz (9) in Eq. (8) and taking into account that\nn1/n = 1 +\n\n1\nln n + . . . ,\nn\n\nx1/n = 1 +\n\n1\nln(1 + x1 + x2 + . . . ) + . . . ,\nn\n\none obtains in order of increasing accuracy of the formula\nx\n\nx\n\n\u00131/n\n\n\u2248\n\n\u0012\n\nln n\nn\n\n\u2248\n\n\u0012\n\nln n \u2212 ln ln n\nn\n\n(10)\n\n,\n\u00131/n\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n... .\nFor n = 2 formula (10)\n\u221a gives x = 0.58871; the error compared to the\nexact solution (0.5( 5 \u2212 1) \u2248 0.618034) is 4.7%. When n = 5, we\nobtain x = 0.79715 from Eq. (10) (from the numerical solution one\nobtains x = 75488; error 4.4%). For n = 5, Eq. (11) gives x = 0.74318\n(error 1.5%). Thus, even the first terms of the large \u03b4 asymptotics give\nexcellent results.\nHence, in this case the method of large delta provides already a\ngood accuracy at low orders of perturbation method. Approximation\n(10), (11) give an example of nonpower asymptotics.\n2.2\n\nHomotopy Perturbation Method\n\nIn recent years the so-called homotopy perturbation method was popular (?) (term \"method of artificial small parameters\" is also used). Its\nessence is as follows. In the equations or boundary conditions a parameter\n\n5\n\n\f\u03b5 is introduced so that for \u03b5 = 0 one obtains a BVP which admits a simple\nsolution, and for \u03b5 = 1 one obtains the governing BVP. Then the perturbation method to \u03b5 is apllied and in the resulting solution was adopted.\nOf course, it is not new and was already used by ?, chapt. I.6 ? and ?.\nThe novelty (and, in my opinion, successful) is the title, emphasizing the\ncontinuous transition from the initial value \u03b5 = 0 to the value of \u03b5 = 1 (homotopy deformation). Let us analyse an example of homotopy perturbation\nparameter method using ?. A special feature of nonlinear systems with distributed parameters is the possibility of internal resonance between modes.\nThat is why in many cases the neglection of higher modes can lead to significant errors. The following describes the asymptotic method of solving\nproblems of nonlinear vibrations of systems with distributed parameters,\nallowing approximately to take into account all modes. The oscillations of\na square membrane on a nonlinear elastic foundation can be written as:\n\u22022w \u22022w \u22022w\n+\n\u2212 2 \u2212 cw \u2212 \u03b5w3 = 0,\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202t\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the dimensionless small parameter (\u03b5 \u226a 1).\nThe BCs are as follows:\n(13)\n\nw|x=0,L = w|y=0,L = 0.\n\nThe desired periodic solution must satisfy the periodicity conditions\n(14)\n\nw(t) = w(t + T ),\n\nwhere T = 2\u03c0\n\u03c9 is the period, and \u03a9 is the natural frequency of oscillation. We\nseek the natural frequencies corresponding to these forms of fundamental\nvibration frequencies at which the linear case (\u03b5 = 0) is realized by one\nhalf-wave in each direction x and y. We introduce the transformation of\ntime:\n\u03c4 = \u03c9t.\n(15)\nThe solution is sought in the form of expansions\nw = w0 + \u03b5w1 + \u03b52 w2 + . . . ,\n\n(16)\n\n2\n\n(17)\n\n\u03c9 = \u03c90 + \u03b5\u03c91 + \u03b5 \u03c92 + . . . .\n\nSubstituting ansatzes (16), (17) into Eqs. (12) - (14) and equating terms of\nequal powers , we obtain a recurrent sequence of linear BVPs:\n\u2202 2 w0\n\u2202 2 w0\n\u2202 2 w0\n+\n\u2212 \u03c902\n\u2212 cw0\n2\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\u2202 2 w1\n\u2202 2 w1\n\u2202 2 w1\n+\n\u2212 \u03c912\n\u2212 cw1\n2\n2\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\n6\n\n=\n\n0,\n\n=\n\n2\u03c90 \u03c91\n\n...\n\n(18)\n\u2202 2 w0\n+ w03 ,\n\u2202\u03c4 2\n\n(19)\n\n\fThe BCs (13) and periodicity conditions (14) take the form for i =\n1, 2, . . . :\nwi |x=0,L = wi |y=0,L = 0,\n(20)\n(21)\n\nwi (\u03c4 ) = wi (\u03c4 + 2\u03c0).\n\nThe solution of Eq. (18) is as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e X\n\u221e\n\u0010 \u03c0m \u0011\n\u0010 \u03c0n \u0011\nX\n\u03c9m,n\nw0,0 =\nAm,n sin\n\u03c4 sin\nx sin\ny ,\n(22)\n\u03c90\nL\nL\nm=1 m=1\nq\n2\n2\nwhere \u03c9m,n =\n\u03c0 2 (m L+n ) + c, m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . and A1,1 is the\namplitude of the fundamental tone of vibrations; Am,n , m, n = 1, 2, 3 . . . ,\n(m, n) 6= (1, 1) is the amplitude of the subsequent modes; \u03c9m,n are the\nnatural frequencies of the linear system, \u03c90 = \u03c91,1 .\nThe next approximation is a result of solving the BVP (19)-(21). To prevent the appearance of secular terms in the r.h.s. of Eq. (19) the coefficients\nof the terms of the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0010 \u03c0m \u0011\n\u0010 \u03c0n \u0011\n\u03c9m,n\n\u03c4 sin\nx sin\ny , m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . .\nsin\n\u03c90\nL\nL\n\nshould be equated to zero.\nThese conditions lead to an infinite system of nonlinear algebraic equations:\n\u221e X\n\u221e X\n\u221e X\n\u221e X\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n2Am,n \u03c91\n2\n(ijklps)\n(\u03c9m,n ) =\nCm,n\nAi,j Ak,l Ap,s ,\n(23)\n\u03b22 \u03c9 0\np=1 s=1\ni=1 j=1\nk=1 l=1\n\nwhere m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\nCoefficients are found by substituting ansatz (22) into the r.h.s. of Eqs.\n(19) and the relevant simplifications. System (23) can be solved by reduction. However, a sufficiently large number of retention equations beging to\nshow significant computational difficulties. In addition, this approach does\nnot take into account the influence of higher oscillation modes. Therefore,\nfurther we use the homotopy perturbation method.\nOn the right side of each (m, n)-th equation of system (23) we introduce\nthe parameter \u03bc to those members of Ai,j Ak,l Ap,s , for which the following\ncondition is valid: (i > m) \u222a (k > m) \u222a (p > m) \u222a (j > n) \u222a (l > n) \u222a (s > n).\nThus, for \u03bc = 0 system (23) takes the \"triangular\" appearance, and for\n\u03bc = 1 it returns to its original form. Next, we seek a solution in the form\nof expansions:\n\u03c91\nAm,n\n\n=\n\n\u03c9 (0) + \u03bc\u03c9 (1) + \u03bc2 \u03c9 (2) + . . . ,\n\n(24)\n\n=\n\nA(0)\nm,n\n\n(25)\n\n+\n\n\u03bcA(1)\nm,n\n\n7\n\n+\u03bc\n\n2\n\nA(2)\nm,n\n\n+ ...,\n\n\fwhere m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , (m, n) 6= (1, 1).\nWe put \u03bc = 1. This approach allows us to keep any number of equations\nin system (23). Below we limit ourselves the first two terms in the expansions\n(24), (25). We analyze the solutions and note that in this problem the\nparameter c plays the role of the bifurcation parameter. In general, for\nc 6= 0, c \u223c 1 , the system (23) admits the following solution:\nAi,j ,\n\u03c91 =\n\ni, j = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,\n27 A2m,n \u03c90\n,\n128 \u03c9m,n2\n\n(i, j) 6= (m, n),\n\nm, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .\n\nAmplitude-frequency response is given by:\n\u03a9m,n = \u03c9m,n + 0.2109375\n\nA2m,n\n\u03b5 + ....\n\u03c9m,n\n\nOf particular interest is the case when the linear component of the restoring force is zero (c = 0) and the phenomenon of internal resonance between\nthe modes of oscillations occurs. Solving system (23) by the described\nmethod, we find\nAm,n = 0, m, n = 1, 2, 3, . . . , (m, n) 6= (1, 1), (m, n) 6= (2i \u2212 1, 2i \u2212 1),\ni = 1, 2, 3 . . . , A3,3 = \u22124.5662 * 10\u22123 A1,1 , A5,5 = 2.1139 * 10\u22125 A1,1 , . . . ,\n\u03c91 = 0.211048A21,1/\u03c90 .\nIf the oscillations are excited by the mode (1, 1) all odd modes (3, 3), (5, 5)\netc. are also realized. However, if the oscillations are excited by one of the\nhigher modes, the result of redistribution of energy modes appear at lower\norders until the fundamental tone (1, 1).\n2.3\n\nMethod of Small Delta\n\n? proposed an effective method of small \u03b4, which we explain by examples.\nLet us construct a periodic solution of the following Cauchy problem\nxtt + x3 = 0,\nx(0) = 1,\n\nxt (0) = 0.\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\nWe introduce a homotopy parameter \u03b4 in Eq. (26), thus:\nxtt + x1+2\u03b4 = 0.\n\n(28)\n\nAt the final expression one should put \u03b4 = 1, but in the process of solving\none must suppose \u03b4 \u226a 1. Then\n\u00012\n(29)\nx2\u03b4 = 1 + \u03b4 ln x2 + 0.5\u03b4 2 ln x2 + . . . .\n\n8\n\n\fWe suppose the solution of Eq. (26) in the form\nx=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03b4 k xk ,\n\n(30)\n\nk=0\n\nand carry out the change of independent variable\nt=\n\n\u03c4\n,\n\u03c9\n\n(31)\n\nwhere \u03c9 2 = 1 + \u03b11 \u03b4 + \u03b12 \u03b4 2 + . . . .\nThe constants \u03b1i (i = 1, 2, . . . ) are determined in the problem solving\nprocess. After substituting ansatzes (29)-(31) into Eq. (28) and splitting\nit with respect to \u03b4, we obtain the following recurrent sequence of Cauchy\nproblems:\nx0\u03c4 \u03c4 + x0 = 0,\n(32)\nx0 (0) = 1,\nx1\u03c4 \u03c4 + x1 =\n\nx2\u03c4 \u03c4 + x2 =\n\n\u2212x1 ln(x21 )\n\nx0\u03c4 (0) = 0;\n\n\u2212x0 ln(x20 )\n\n\u2212 \u03b11 x0\u03c4 \u03c4 ,\n\nx1 (0) = x1\u03c4 = 0;\n\u00012\n\u2212 2x1 \u2212 x0 ln(x20 ) \u2212 \u03b12 x0\u03c4 \u03c4 \u2212 \u03b11 x1\u03c4 \u03c4 ;\nx1 (0) = x1\u03c4 = 0;\n\n(33)\n(34)\n(35)\n(36)\n(37)\n\n....\nA Cauchy problem of the zero approximation (32), (33) has the solution .\nx0 = cos \u03c4.\nIn a first approximation, one obtains\nx1\u03c4 \u03c4 + x1 = \u2212 cos \u03c4 ln(cos2 \u03c4 ) + \u03b11 cos \u03c4 \u2261 L0 .\nThe condition of the absence of the secular terms in the solution of this\nequation can be written as follows:\nZ\u03c0/2\nL0 cos t dt = 0,\n0\n\nwhich is determined by the constant \u03b11 = 1 \u2212 2 ln 2. The expression for the\noscillation period can be written as\nT = 2\u03c0[1 + \u03b4(ln 2 \u2212 0.5)].\n\n9\n\n\fFor \u03b4 = 1, we have T = 6.8070, while the exact value is T = 7.4164\n(the error of approximate solutions is 8.2%). The solution of the Cauchy\nproblems of the next approximation (36),(37) gives the value of the period,\nit practically coincides with the exact one (T = 7.4111).\nWe now consider the wave equation\n(38)\n\nutt = uxx ,\nwith nonlinear BCs:\nu(0, t) =\nux (1, t) + u(1, t) + u3 (1, t) =\n\n0,\n0.\n\n(39)\n(40)\n\nWe introduce the parameter \u03b4 in Eq.

At n = 1 one obtains the exact values\nx = sin t, T = 2\u03c0 , for n \u2192 \u221e one obtains T \u2192 4. Expanding the r.h.s. of\nthe Eq. (72) in a series of t and restricting it to the first term, we obtain\nnonsmooth solution (?). We estimate the error of the solution (73). For\nthis we use the expression\nZ\u03c0/2\nsin\u22121+\u03bb d\u03b8 = 0.5\u03bbB(0.5\u03bb, 0.5) \u2261 A1 ,\n\u03bb\n0\n\n14\n\n(74)\n\n\fwhere B(. . . , . . . ) is the beta function (?, Sect.6). The approximate value of\nthe integral on the l.h.s. of Eq. (72) is calculated as follows: A2 = (\u03c0/2)\u03bb\n.

Comparison of exact and approximate solutions.\nThus, the first approximation of the asymptotics for n \u2192 \u221e already\ngives quite acceptable accuracy for practical purposes, even for not very\nlarge values of n. Note that the expression (72) gives an approximation of\nincomplete beta function (?, Sect.6) from n = 1 (sinus function) to n = \u221e\n(linear function).\n2.5\n\nApplication of Distributions\n\nAsymptotic methods are based, generally speaking, on the use of Taylor\nseries. In this connection the question arises: what to do with the functions\nof the form exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x), which cannot be expanded in a Taylor series in\n\u03b5 \u2192 0, using smooth functions (?). The way out lies in the transition to\nthe following distribution (?):\nH(x) exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(\u22121)n \u03b5n+1 \u03b4 (n) (x),\n\n(75)\n\nn=0\n\nwhere \u03b4(x) is the Dirac delta function, representing the derivative of the\nHeavisyde function H(x) in the theory of distribution; \u03b4 (n) (x), n = 1, 2, . . .\nare the derivatives of the delta function.\nWe show how formal the formula (75) can be obtained. Applying the\nLaplace transform to function exp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x), one obtains:\nZ\u221e\n\nexp(\u2212\u03b5\u22121 x) dx =\n\n\u03b5\n.\n\u03b5p + 1\n\n0\n\nExpanding the r.h.s. of this equation in a Maclaurin series of \u03b5, and then\ncalculating inverse transform term by term, one obtains expansion (75).\nThus, we again use the Taylor series, but now in the dual space.\n\n15\n\n\fHere is another interesting feature of the approach using distributions:\na singular perturbated problem can be regarded as a regular perturbated\none (?). Suppose, for example,\n\u03b5y \u2032 + y = 0\n\ny = 1 at x = 0.\n\nx > 0,\n\nThis is singular perturbated problem: for \u03b5 = 0 one obtains a smooth\nsolution y = 0, which does not satisfy the given initial condition. However,\none can seek a solution in the form of a nonsmooth function. Namely,\nassuming z(x) = H(x)y(x), one obtains\n\u03b5z \u2032 = \u2212z + \u03b5\u03b4(x).\n\n(76)\n\nThe solution of Eq. (76) is sought in the form of expansions\nz=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nzn \u03b5n .\n\nn=0\n\nAs a result, one obtains\nz0 = 0,\n\nz1 = \u03b4(x),\n\nzn+1 = (\u22121)n \u03b4 (n) ,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(77)\n\nNote that the expressions (77) can go to the smooth functions. To do this,\nit is possible to apply the Laplace transform, then the Pad\u00e9 approximants\nin the dual spase and then to calculate inverse Laplace transform.\nWe show other application of the asymptotic method using distribution.\nConsider the equation of the membrane, reinforced with fibers of the small,\nbut finite width \u03b5. The governing PDE is:\n[1 + 2\u03b5\u03a60 (y)]uxx + uyy = 0,\nwhere \u03a60 (y) =\n\n\u221e\nP\n\n(78)\n\n[H(y + kb \u2212 \u03b5) + H(y \u2212 kb + \u03b5)].\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\nLet us expand the function \u03a60 (y) in a series of \u03b5. Applying the two-sided\nLaplace transform (?), one obtains:\n\u03a6\u0304(p, \u03b5) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\ne\u2212p|y| \u03a6(y, \u03b5) dy\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nExpanding the function \u03a6\u0304(p, \u03b5) in a series of \u03b5 and performing the inverse\nLaplace transform, we obtain\nX\n\u03a60 (y) = 2\u03b5\u03a6(y) + 2\u03b5\n\u03b5n \u03a6(n) (y),\n(79)\nk=1,3,5,...\n\n16\n\n\fwhere \u03a6(y) =\n\n\u221e\nP\n\nk=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03b4(y \u2212 kb).\n\nNow let us consider the solution of the Eq. (78) in the form\nu = u0 + \u03b5u1 + \u03b52 u2 + . . . .\n\n(80)\n\nSubstituting ansatzes (79), (80) into Eq. (78) and splitting the resulting\nequation with respect to \u03b5, we arrive at the recursive sequence of BVPs\n[1 + 2\u03b5\u03a6(y)] u0xx + u0yy\n[1 + 2\u03b5\u03a6(y)] u1xx + u1yy\n\n=\n=\n...\n\n0,\n\u2212\u03b5u0xx\u03a6y (y),\n\n(81)\n(82)\n\nThus, in the zero approximation, we obtain the problem with one-dimensional\nfibers (81), the influence of the width of the filaments is taken into account\nin the following approximations (82).\n\n3\n3.1\n\nSummation of Asymptotic Series\nAnalysis of Power Series\n\nWe suppose that one obtains the following series as a result of an asymptotic study:\n\u221e\nX\nf (\u03b5) \u223c\nCn \u03b5n for \u03b5 \u2192 0.\n(83)\nn=0\n\nAs it is known, the radius of convergence \u03b50 of series (83) is determined by\nthe distance to the nearest singularity of the function f (\u03b5) on the complex\nplane and can be found using the Cauchy-Hadamard formula:\n1\n= lim |Cn |1/n .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\u03b50\nIf the nearest singularity lies on the positive real axis, then the coefficients\nCn have the usually one and the same algebraic sign, for example,\n1\n\u223c 1 + \u03b5 + \u03b52 + \u03b53 + . . . .\n1\u2212\u03b5\nIf the nearest singularity is located on the negative axis, the algebraic signs\nof the coefficients Cn are usually alternated, for example,\n1\n\u223c 1 \u2212 \u03b5 + \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 + . . . .\n1+\u03b5\n\n17\n\n\fThe pattern of signs is usually set pretty quickly. If there are several features\nof the same radius, that could happen to a real function with complex\nsingularities necessarily occurring in complex conjugate pairs, then the rule\nof alternation of signs may be more complex, such as\n1+\u03b5\n\u223c 1 + \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b52 \u2212 \u03b53 + \u03b54 + \u03b55 \u2212 \u03b56 \u2212 \u03b57 . . . .\n1 + \u03b52\nHere we have a pattern of signs + + \u2212\u2212. To define \u03b50 may it is useful to\napply the so-called Domb-Sykes plot (????).

If several singularities have\nthe same convergence radius, so that the signs of the coefficients oscillate,\n1/2\nyou can try to construct a dependence on the value (Cn /Cn\u22121 ) . If the\nradius of convergence tends to infinity and Cn /Cn\u22121 \u223c k/n, then the analyzed function has a factor exp(k\u03b5), when Cn /Cn\u22121 \u223c k/n1/p it has a factor\nexp(\u03b5p ).

Pad\u00e9 approximants (PA) allow us to\nimplement among the most salient natural transformation of power series\nin a fractional rational function. Let us define a PA following ?.

(93),(94) are called Pad\u00e9 equations. In the case\nwhere the system (94) is solvable, one can obtain the Pad\u00e9 coefficients of\nthe numerator and denominator of the PA. Functions f[n/m] (\u03b5) at different\nvalues of n and m form a set, which is usually written in the form of a table,\ncalled the Pad\u00e9 table (Table 3):\n\u274d\u274d\nn\n0\n\u274d\u274d\nm\n\u274d\n0\nf[0/0] (\u03b5)\n1\nf[0/1] (\u03b5)\n2\nf[0/2] (\u03b5)\n...\n...\n\n1\n\n2\n\n...\n\nf[1/0] (\u03b5)\nf[1/1] (\u03b5)\nf[1/2] (\u03b5)\n...\n\nf[2/0] (\u03b5)\nf[2/1] (\u03b5)\nf[2/2] (\u03b5)\n...\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\nTable 3. Pad\u00e9 table.\nThe terms of the first row of the Pad\u00e9 table correspond to the finite sums\nof the Maclaurin series. In case of n = m one obtains the diagonal PA, the\nmost common practice. Note that the Pad\u00e9 table can have gaps for those\nindices n, m, for which the PA does not exist. We note some properties of\nthe PA (???):\n1. If the PA at the chosen m and n exists, then it is unique.\n2. If the PA sequence converges to some function, the roots of its denominator tend to the poles of the function. This allows for a sufficiently\nlarge number of terms to determine the pole, and then perform an\nanalytical continuation.\n3. The PA has meromorphic continuation of a given power series functions.\n4. The PA on the inverse function is treated the PA function inverse\nitself. This property is called duality and more exactly formulated as\nfollows. Let\nq(\u03b5) = f \u22121 (\u03b5)\n\nand f (0) 6= 0,\n\n23\n\nthen\n\n\u22121\nq[n/m] (\u03b5) = f[n/m]\n(\u03b5), (96)\n\n\fprovided that one of these approximations there.\n5. Diagonal PA are invariant under fractional linear transformations of\nthe argument. Suppose that the function is given by their expansion\n(91). Consider the linear fractional transformation that preserves the\na\u03b5\norigin W = 1+b\u03b5\n, and the function q(W ) = f (\u03b5). Then q[n/n] , provided that one of these approximations exist. In particular, the diagonal PA is invariant concerning Euler transformation (89).\n6. Diagonal PA are invariant under fractional linear transformations of\nfunctions. Let us analyse a function (91). Let\nq(\u03b5) =\n\na + bf (\u03b5)\n.\nc + df (\u03b5)\n\nIf c + df (\u03b5) 6= 0, then\nq[n/n] (\u03b5) =\n\na + bf[n/n] (\u03b5)\n,\nc + df[n/n] (\u03b5)\n\nprovided that there is f[n/n] (\u03b5). Because of this property infinite values\nof PA can be considered on a par with the end.\n7. The PA can get the upper and lower bounds for f[n/n] (\u03b5). For the\ndiagonal PA one has the estimate\nf[n/n\u22121] (\u03b5) \u2264 f[n/n] (\u03b5) \u2264 f[n/n+1] (\u03b5).\n\n(97)\n\nTypically, this estimate is valid for the function itself, i.e. f[n/n] (\u03b5)\nin Eq. (97) can be replaced by f (\u03b5) .\n8. Diagonal and close to them a sequence of PA often possess the property of autocorrection (??). It consists of the following. To determine\nthe coefficients of the numerator and denominator of PA have to solve\nsystems of linear algebraic equations. This is an ill-posed procedure,\nso the coefficients of PA can be determined with large errors. However, these errors are in a certain sense of self-consistency, the PA can\napproximate the searching function with a higher accucary. This is a\nradical difference between the PA and the Taylor series.\nAutocorrection property is verified for a number of special functions. At\nthe same time, even for elliptic functions the so-called Froissart doublets\nphenomenon arises, consisting of closely spaced zeros and poles to each\nother (but different and obviously irreducible) in the PA. This phenomenon\nis not of numerical nature, but due to the nature of the elliptic function (?).\nThus, in general, having no information about the location of the poles of\nthe PA, but relying solely on the PA (computed exactly as you wish), we\n\n24\n\n\fcan not say that you have found a good approximation for the approximated\nfunction.\nTo overcome these defects several methods are suggested, in particular,\nthe smoothing method (?). Its essence is that instead of the usual-term\ndiagonal PA for complex functions f[n/n] (\u03b5) = pn (\u03b5)/qn (\u03b5) the following\nexpression is used\nf[n/n] (\u03b5) =\n\nqn (\u03b5)pn (\u03b5) + qn\u22121 (\u03b5)pn\u22121 (\u03b5)\nqn (\u03b5)qn (\u03b5) + qn\u22121 (\u03b5)qn\u22121 (\u03b5)\n\nHere f denotes complex conjugation of f .\nNow consider the question: in what sense can the available mathematical results on the convergence of the PA facilitate the solution of practical\nproblems? Gonchar's theorem (Gonchar, 1986) states: if none of the diagonal PA f[n/n] (\u03b5) has poles in the circle of radius R, then the sequence\nf[n/n] (\u03b5) is uniformly convergent in the circle to the original function f (\u03b5).\nMoreover, the absence of poles of the sequence of the f[n/n] (\u03b5) in a circle of\nradius R must be original and confirm convergence of the Taylor series in\nthe circle. Since for the diagonal PA invariant under fractional linear maps\n\u03b5\nwe have \u03b5 \u2192 a\u03b5+b\n, the theorem is true for any open circle containing the\npoint of decomposition, and for any area, which is the union of these circles.\nA significant drawback in practice is the need to check all diagonal PA. For\nexample, the following theorem holds (?): Suppose the sequence of diagonal Pad\u00e9 approximants of the function w(\u03b5), which is holomorphic in the\nunit disc and has no poles outside this circle. Then this sequence converges\nuniformly to w(\u03b5) in the disc |z| < r0 , where 0.583R < r0 < 0.584R.\nHow can we use these results? Suppose that there are a few terms of the\nperturbation series and someone wants to estimate its radius of convergence\nR. Consider the interval [0, \u03b50 ], where the truncated perturbation series and\nthe diagonal PA of the maximal possible order differ by no more than 5%\n(adopted in the engineering accuracy of the calculations). If none of the\nprevious diagonal PA does not have poles in a circle of radius \u03b50 , then it is\na high level of confidence to assert that R \u2265 \u03b50 .\nThe procedure of constructing the PA is much less labor intensive than\nthe construction of higher approximations of the perturbation theory. The\nPA is not limited to power series, but to the series of orthogonal polynomials. PA is locally the best rational approximation of a given power series.\nThey are constructed directly on its odds and allow the efficient analytic\ncontinuation of the series outside its circle of convergence, and their poles\nin a certain sense localize the singular points (including the poles and their\nmultiplicities) of the continuation function at the corresponding region of\nconvergence and on its boundary. This PA fundamentally different from\n\n25\n\n\frational approximations to (fully or partially) fixed poles, including those\nfrom the polynomial approximation, in which case all the poles are fixed\nin one, infinity, the point. Currently, the PA method is one of the most\npromising non-linear methods of summation of power series and the localization of its singular points. Including the reason why the theory of the\nPA turned into a completely independent section of approximation theory,\nand these approximations have found a variety of applications both directly\nin the theory of rational approximations, and in perturbation theory. Thus,\nthe main advantages of PA compared with the Taylor series as follows:\n1. Typically, the rate of convergence of rational approximations greatly\nexceeds the rate of convergence of polynomial approximation. For example, the function e\u03b5 in the circle of convergence approximated by\nrational polynomials Pn (\u03b5)/Qn (\u03b5) in 4n times better than an algebraic\npolynomial of degree 2n. More tangible it is property for functions\nof limited smoothness. Thus, the function |\u03b5| on the interval [\u22121, 1]\ncan not be approximated by algebraic polynomials, so that the order of approximation was better than 1/n, where n is \u221a\nthe \u0001degree of\npolynomial. PA gives the rate of convergence \u223c exp \u2212 2n .\n2. Typically, the radius of convergence of rational approximation is a\nlarge compared with power series. Thus, for the function arctan(x)\nTaylor polynomials converge only if |\u03b5| \u2264 1, and AP - everywhere in\nC \\ ((\u2212i\u221e, \u2212i] \u222a [i, i\u221e)).\n3. PA can establish the position of singularities of the function.\nSimilarly, the PA method is a method of continued fractions (?). There are\nseveral types of continued fractions. The regular C-fraction has the form of\nan infinite sequence, in which N -th term can be written as follows\nfN (\u03b5) = a +\n\nc0\n.\nc1 \u03b5\n1+\nc2 \u03b5\n1+\n1+\n..\n.\ncN +1 \u03b5\n1 + cN \u03b5\n\n(98)\n\nThe coefficients ci are obtained after the decomposition of expression\n(98) in a Maclaurin series and then equating the coefficients of equal powers\nof \u03b5. When a = 0 one obtains the fraction of Stieltjes or S-fraction. For the\nfunction of Stieltjes\nZ\u221e\nexp(\u2212t)\nS(\u03b5) =\ndt,\n1 + \u03b5t\n0\n\n26\n\n\fthe coefficients of expansion (98) have the form: a = 0, c0 = 1, c2n\u22121 =\nc2n = n, n \u2265 1.\nDescription of the so-called J-, T-, P-, R-, g-fractions, algorithms for\ntheir construction and the range of applicability are described in detail in\n?.\nContinued fractions are a special case of continuous functional approximation (?). This is the sequence in which the (n + 1)-th term cn (\u03b5) has the\nform n-th iteration of a function F (\u03b5). For the Taylor series one obtains\n1\n. If F (\u03b5) = exp(\u03b5) one\nF (\u03b5) = 1 + \u03b5, for the continuous fraction F (\u03b5) = 1+\u03b5\nobtains a continuous exponential approximation\ncn (\u03b5) = a0 exp {a1 \u03b5 exp [a2 \u03b5 . . . exp (an \u03b5)]} ,\n\u221a\nfor F (\u03b5) = 1 + \u03b5\ns\nr\nq\n\u221a\ncn (\u03b5) = a0 1 + a1 \u03b5 1 + a2 \u03b5 1 + . . . an\u22121 \u03b5 1 + an \u03b5,\n\nfor F (\u03b5) = ln 1 + \u03b5\n\ncn (\u03b5) = a0 ln {a1 \u03b5 ln [a2 \u03b5 . . . ln (an \u03b5)]} .\n\nIn some cases, such approximations can converge significantly faster than\npower series.\nAs an example, we note the solution of the transcendental equation\nx = \u03b5 ln x\nfor large values (?, \u00a73.4.9)) \u03bb:\nx0 = \u03b5 ln \u03b5;\n\n4\n4.1\n\nx1 = \u03b5 ln(\u03b5 ln \u03b5);\n\nx2 = \u03b5 ln[\u03b5 ln(\u03b5 ln \u03b5)]; . . . .\n\nSome Applications of Pad\u00e9 Approximants\nAccelerating Convergence of Iterative Processes\n\nThe efficiency of PA or other methods of summation depends largely on\nthe availability of higher approximations of the asymptotic process. Sometimes they can be obtained by using computer algorithms (?), but in general\nit remains an open question. Iterative methods are significantly easier to\nimplement. As a result of an iterative procedure a sequence of Sn is obtained. Suppose that it converges and has the limit value.

The biggest issues are, of course, logarithmically\nconvergent sequences - alas, widespread practice. Very often linearly convergent sequences are also a problem. Therefore, it is often necessary to\nimprove the convergence. One method of improving the convergence is to\nmove to a new sequence Tn with the aid of a transformation so that\n\nlim\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nT n \u2212 Sn\n= 0.\nSn \u2212 S\n\nIn such cases we say that the sequence Tn converges faster than sequence\nSn .

There are many other techniques for accelerating of sequences' convergence. One can use them consistently, for\nexample, to convert the original sequence into a linearly convergent one,\nand then apply the method of Aitken. One can also use different methods\nto improve convergence, at each stage by comparing the obtained results\n(?). All the described methods have a close relationship with the PA. The\nAitken method corresponds to the PA [n/1] , the Shanks method to the PA\n(n)\n[p/k], for the method of Wynn one obtains T2k = [n + k/k].\n4.2\n\nRemoving Singularities and Reducing the Gibbs Effect\n\nConsider the problem of uniform plane flow of an incompressible inviscid\nfluid pasting a thin elliptic airfoil (|x| \u2264 1, |y| \u2264 \u03b5, \u03b5 \u226a 1).

A simple way to approximate a function is to choose\na sequence of points\na = x0 < x1 < x2 * * * < xn = b,\n\n36\n\n\fand to construct the interpolating polynomial pn (x)\npn (xi ) = f (xi ),\n\ni = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n.\n\nHowever, as is well-known pn (x) may not be a good approximation to f ,\nand for large n \u226b 1 it can exhibit wild oscillations. If we are free to choose\nthe distribution of the interpolation points xi , one remedy is to cluster them\nnear the end-points of the interval [a, b], for example using various kinds of\nChebyshev points.\nSowe have to make do with them, and then we need to look for other\nkinds of interpolants. A very popular alternative nowadays is to use splines\n(piecewise polynomials), which have become a standard tool for many kinds\nof interpolation and approximation algorithms, and for geometric modeling.\nHowever, it has been known for a long time that the use of rational functions\ncan also lead to much better approximations than ordinary polynomials. In\nfact, both, polynomial and rational interpolation, can exhibit exponential\nconvergence when approximating analytic functions. In \"classical\" rational\ninterpolation, one chooses some M and N such that M + N = n and fits\nto the values f (xi ), where pM and qN\na rational function of the form pqM\nN\nare polynomials of degrees M and N respectively. If n is even, it is typical\nto set M + N = n2 , and some authors have reported excellent results. The\nmain drawback, though, is that there is no control over the occurrence of\npoles in the interval of interpolation.\n? suggested that it might be possible to avoid poles by using rational\nfunctions of higher degree. They considered algorithms which fit rational\nfunctions whose numerator and denominator degrees can both be as high\nas n. This is a convenient class of rational interpolants because every such\ninterpolant can be written in so-called barycentric form\nn\nP\n\u03bbi\nf (xi )\ni=0 x \u2212 xi\nr(x) = n\nP \u03bbi\nf (xi )\ni=0 x \u2212 xi\nfor some real values \u03bbi . Thus it suffices to choose the weights \u03bbi in order\nto specify r, and the idea is to search for weights which give interpolants r\nthat have no poles and preferably good approximation properties. Various\napproach is described in ?, in particular, one can choose \u03bbi = (\u22121)i , i =\n0, 1, 2, . . . , n.\n4.8\n\nSome Other Applications\n\nPA is widely used for the construction of solitons and other localized\nsolutions of nonlinear problems, even in connection with the appeared term\n\n37\n\n\f\"padeon\" (??). As a simple model, we consider the nonlinear BVP\ny \u2032\u2032 \u2212 y + 2y 3 = 0,\ny(0) = 1, y(\u221e) = 0,\n\n(126)\n(127)\n\nthat has an exact localized solution\ny = cosh\u22121 (x)\n\n(128)\n\nQuasilinear asymptotics give a solution in the following form:\n\u0001\ny = Ce\u2212x 1 \u2212 0.25C 2 e\u22122x + 0.0625C 4e\u22124x + . . . , C = const.\n\n(129)\n\nIt is easy to verify that with reconstructing the truncated series (129) in the\nPA and to determine the constant C from the BCs (127) and we arrive at\nthe exact solution (128).\nIt is also interesting to use the PA to the problems with the phenomenon\nof \"blow-up\", when the solution goes to infinity at a finite value of the\nargument. For example, the Cauchy problem\ndx\n= \u03b1x + \u03b5x2 ,\ndt\n\nx(0) = 1,\n\n0 < \u03b5 \u226a \u03b1 \u226a 1,\n\n(130)\n\nhas the exact solution\nx(t) =\n\n\u03b1 exp(\u03b1t)\n,\n\u03b1 + \u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 exp(\u03b1t)\n\n(131)\n\nwhich tends to infinity for t \u2192 ln[(\u03b1 + \u03b5)/\u03b5].\nRegular asymptotic expansion\nx(t) \u223c exp(\u03b1t) \u2212 \u03b5\u03b1\u22121 exp(\u03b1t)[1 \u2212 exp(\u03b1t)] + . . .\ncan not describe this phenomenon, but the use of the PA gives the exact\nsolution (131).\nPA allows to expand the scope of the known approximate methods.

PA can be used\neffectively to solve ill-posed problems. This could include reconstruction\nof functions in the presence of noise (??), various problems of dehomogenization (i.e., determining the components of a composite material on its\nhomogenized characteristics) (?), etc. We must also mention 2D PA (?).\n\n5\n5.1\n\nMatching of Limiting Asymptotic Expansions\nMethod of Asymptotically Equivalent Functions for Inversion of Laplace Transform\n\nThis method was originally proposed by Slepian and Yakovlev for the\ntreatment of integral transformations. Here is a description of this method,\nfollowing ?. Suppose that the Laplace transform of a function of a real\nvariable f (t) is:\nZ\u221e\nF (s) = f (t)e\u2212st ds.\n0\n\nTo obtain an approximate expression for the inverse transform, it is\nnecessary to clarify the behavior of the transform the vicinity of the points\ns = 0 and s = \u221e and determine the nature and location of its singular\npoints are on the exact boundary of the regularity or near it. Then the\ntransform F (s) replaced by the function F0 (s), allowing the exact inversion\nand satisfying the following conditions:\n1. Functions F0 (s) and F (s) are asymptotically equivalent at s \u2192 \u221e and\ns \u2192 0, i.e.\nF0 (s) \u223c F (s) at s \u2192 0 and s \u2192 \u221e.\n2. Singular points of the functions F0 (s) and F (s), located on the exact\nboundary of the regularity, coincide.\nThe free parameters of the function F0 (s) are chosen in such a way that\nthey satisfy the conditions of the approximate approximation of F (s) in the\nsense of minimum relative error for all real values s \u2265 0:\n\u001b\n\u001a\nF0 (s, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1k )\n\u22121 .\n(132)\nmin max\nF (s)\nCondition (132) is achieved by variation of free the parameters \u03b1i . Often\nthe implementation of equalities\nZ\u221e\n\nF0 (s) ds =\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n0\n\n39\n\nF (s) ds\n\n\for F0\u2032 \u223c F0\u2032 at s \u2192 0 leads to a rather precise fulfillment of the requirements\n(132). Constructed in such a way the function is called asymptotically\nequivalent function (AEF).\nHere is an example of constructing AEF. Find the inverse transform if\nthe Laplace transform is the modified Bessel function (?, Sect.9):\nK0 (s) = \u2212 ln(s/2)I0 (s) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=0\n\ns2k\n\u03a8(k + 1)\n22k (k!)2\n\n(133)\n\nwhere \u03a8(z) is the psi (digamma) function (?, Sect.6).\nFor pure imaginary values of the argument s(s = iy; 0 < |y| < \u221e)\nfunction K0 (s) has no singular points. Consequently, we can restrict the\nstudy of its behavior for s \u2192 0 and s \u2192 \u221e. The corresponding asymptotic\nexpressions are (?, Sect.9):\nh s\ni\nK0 (s) = \u2212 ln + \u03b3 + O(s),\ns \u2192 0,\n2\n(134)\nr\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u0015\n\u03c0 \u2212s\n1\nK0 (s) =\n, s \u2192 \u221e,\ne\n1+O\n2s\ns\nwhere \u03b3 is the Euler's constant (\u03b3 = 1, 781 . . . ) (note the typo in the first\nformula (134) in ?).\nThe analyzed Laplace transform has a branch point of the logarithmic\ntype, branch point of an algebraic type, and an essential singularity. These\nsingular points need to be stored in the structure of the zero approximation.\nThe most simple way to obtain such a structure, combining two asymptotic\nrepresentations (134) so that they are mutually do not distort each other\nand contain free parameters, which could be disposed of in the future.

Analogously, one can\nconstruct AEFs for inverse sine and cosine Fourier transforms, Hankel and\nother integral transforms.\n5.2\n\nTwo-point Pad\u00e9 Approximants\n\nThe analysis of numerous examples confirms: usually implemented a sort\nof \"complementarity principle\": if for \u03b5 \u2192 0 one can construct a physically\nmeaningful asymptotics, there is a nontrivial asymptotics and \u03b5 \u2192 \u221e. The\nmost difficult in terms of the asymptotic approach is the intermediate case\nof \u03b5 \u223c 1. In this domain numerical methods typically work well, however, if\nthe task is to investigate the solution depending on the parameter \u03b5, then it\nis inconvenient to use different solutions in different areas. Construction of\na unified solution on the basis of limiting asymptotics is not a trivial task,\nwhich can be summarized as follows: we know the behavior of functions in\nzones I and III (Figure 8), we need to construct it in the zone II. For this\npurpose one can use a two-point Pad\u00e9 approximants (TPPA). We give the\n\n41\n\n\fFigure 7.

Consider, for example, the BVP\n\u03b5yxx \u2212 xy = \u03b5y,\n\ny(0) = 1,\n\ny(\u221e) = 0, \u03b5\n\n\u226a 1.\n\n(145)\n\nSolution for small values of x can be written as follows:\n1\ny = 1 \u2212 a\u03be + \u03be 3 + O(\u03be 4 )\n6\n\n(146)\n\n1\n\nwhere \u03be = x\u03b5\u2212 3 , a is the arbitrary constant.\nThe solution for large values of x is constructed using the WKB method\n(?)\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0012\n\u0001\n1\n3\n5\n2 3\n1 \u2212 \u03be \u2212 2 + O \u03be \u22123\n(147)\ny = b\u03be \u2212 4 exp \u2212 \u03be 2\n3\n48\n\nwhere b is an arbitrary constant.\nNow we match these asymptotics. Because of the exponential in Eq.\n(147) using TPPA in the original form is not possible. Therefore, we construct AEF, based on the following considerations: for large values of the\n\n45\n\n\fvariable \u03be exponent from Eq. (147) is taken into account in its original\nform, and for small values of the variable \u03be it is expanded in a Maclaurin\nseries. Constructed in this way AEF has the form\n2 3\n2 5\n32\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 a\u03be + \u03be 2 \u2212 \u03be 2 + a\u03be 4\n2 3\n3\n3\n5\nya =\nexp \u2212 \u03be 2\n32 a 17\n3\n\u03be4\n1+\n5 b\n\n(148)\n\nThe coefficients a and b in Eq. (148) still remain uncertain. For calculation\nof these constants one can use some integral relations, for example, obtained\nfrom Eq. (148) by multiplying them with the weighting functions 1, x, x2 , . . .\nand further integration over the interval [0, \u221e). In the end, such values of\nthe constants are found:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2\n2\n3\n3\n3\u0393\n9\u0393\n3\n3\n\u0012 \u0013 , b=\n\u221a\na=\n(149)\n2\n2 \u03c0\n\u0393\n3\nNumerical calculations show that the formula (148) with constants (149)\napproximates the desired solution in the whole interval [0, \u221e) with an error\nnot exceeding 1.5%.\nWhen choosing the constants one can use other methods, then a lot\ndepends on the skill of the researcher. Of course, it is necessary to ensure\nthe correct qualitative behavior of AEFs, avoiding, for example, do not\ncorrespond to the problem of zeros of the denominator. To do this, one\ncan vary the number of terms in the asymptotics and the numerator and\ndenominator constructed uniformly suitable solutions. In general form the\nmethod of rational AEF can be described as follows (?). Let us assume that\nfunction f (z) has the following asymptotics:\nf (z) = F (z) at z \u2192 \u221e,\nand\nf (z) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nci z i\n\ni=0\n\nat z \u2192 0.\n\n(150)\n\n(151)\n\nThen the AEF can be produced from the Eqs. (152), (153) as follows:\nm\nP\n\nf (z) \u2248 i=0\nn\nP\n\n\u03b1i (z)z i\n\u03b2i (z)z i\n\ni=0\n\n46\n\nat z \u2192 0.\n\n(152)\n\n\fwhere \u03b1i , \u03b2i are considered not as constants but as some functions of z.\nFunctions \u03b1i (z) and \u03b2i (z) are chosen in such a way that:\n1. the expansion of AEF (152) in powers of z for z \u2192 0 matches the\nperturbation expansion (151);\n2. the asymptotic behavior of AEF (152) for z \u2192 \u221e coincides with the\nfunction F (z) (150).\nIn the construction of AEFs a priori qualitative information is very important. For example, if from any considerations it is known that the unknown function is close to the power, you can use the method of Sommerfeld\n(?). Its essence is to replace a segment of the power series\nf (x) = 1 + a1 x + a2 x2 + . . . ,\n\n(153)\n\nf (x) \u2248 (1 + Ax)\u03bc .\n\n(154)\n\nto the function\nExpanding expression (154) in a Maclaurin series and comparing coefficients\nof this expansion with (153), one obtains\nA=\n\na21 \u2212 2a2\n;\na1\n\n\u03bc=\n\na21\na21 \u2212 2a2\n\nNumerical approaches also can be used for the construction of AEFs. For\nexample, in paper by ? a computational technique for matching limiting\nasymptotics is described.\nSometimes it is possible to construct so called composite equations,\nwhich can be treated as \"asymptotically equivalent equations\". Let us emphasize, that the composite equations, due to ?, can be obtained in result\nof synthesis of the limiting cases. The principal idea of the method of the\ncomposite equations can be formulated in the following way (?, p.195):\n1. Identify the terms in the differential equations whose neglect in the\nstraightforward approximation is responsible for the nonuniformity.\n2. Approximate those terms insofar as possible while retaining their essential character in the region of nonuniformity.\nLet's dwell on the terminology. Here we use the term \"asymptotically\nequivalent function\". Other terms (\"reduced method of matched asymptotic\nexpansions\" (?), \"quasifractional approximants\" (?), \"mimic function\" (?,\np.181\u2013243) also used.\n5.4\n\nExample: Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\n\nFor the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (60) with boundary conditions (61) previously we obtained a solution for the exponent, little different from the two\n\n47\n\n\f(68).
