Frustrated systems have been intensively studied over the last decades and they were found\nto present very rich behavior such as large ground-state\ndegeneracies. A recent review on frustrated systems is\npresented in Ref. 1.\nThe Shastry-Sutherland lattice (SSL) was considered\nmore than 20 years ago by Shastry and Sutherland as\nan interesting example of a frustrated quantum spin system with an exact ground state.2 It can be described as\na square lattice with J \u2032 antiferromagnetic couplings between nearest neighbors and additional J antiferromagnetic couplings between next-nearest neighbors in every\nsecond square (see Fig. 1 left panel).\nThis lattice attracted much attention after an experimental realization was identified in SrCu2 (BO3 )2 ,3 a compound which was first synthesized by Smith and Keszler.4\nSrCu2 (BO3 )2 exhibits a layered structure of Cu(BO3 )\nplanes separated by magnetically inert Sr atoms. The\nCu2+ ions carry a spin S = 1/2 and are located on a\nlattice which is topologically equivalent to the SSL (see\nFig. 1 right panel). The quantum SSL was widely studied both theoretically and experimentally (see Ref. 5 for\na review). As the ratio J \u2032 /J varies, it presents a rich\nphase diagram with quantum phase transitions between\nthe gapped dimer singlet ground state (J \u2032 /J . 0.68) that\nwas originally discussed by Shastry and Sutherland,2 a\nplaquette resonating valence bond state (J \u2032 /J . 0.86),\nand a gapless magnetic state.6,7 Theoretical studies on\nthe quantum SSL predicted the existence of plateaux in\nthe magnetization curve for the rational values of the\nsaturated magnetization M/Msat = 1/8, 1/4, 1/3 and\n\nJ\nJ'\n\nJ'\n\nJ'\n\nJ\n[010\u2104\n\nJ'\n\n[100\u2104\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) The Shastry-Sutherland lattice (left\npanel) and the topologically identical structure realized in\nthe (001) plane of SrCu2 (BO3 )2 and rare-earth tetraborides\n(right panel). J \u2032 bonds are the magnetic couplings along the\nedges of the squares (clear dashed lines) and J bonds (black\nbold lines) are the diagonal dimer couplings.\n\n1/2: Momoi and Totsuka8,9 showed that the stripe order of the dimer triplets explains the M/Msat = 1/2\nand 1/3 plateaux and the latter was predicted to be the\nbroadest. Experimentally, magnetization plateaux were\nobserved3,10,11 for M/Msat = 1/8, 1/4 and 1/3 (see, however, Refs. 12,13 for recent experimental controversies).\nMiyahara and Ueda14 explained the existence of all those\nplateaux as a consequence of the crystallization of excited\ntriplets, although e.g. the existence of the M/Msat = 1/8\nplateau is not confirmed in a recent investigation.15\nRecently, rare-earth tetraborides RB4 have been attracting new interest to the SSL.16,17,18,19,20,21,22 These\ncompounds present a large total magnetic moment J >\n1, which justifies a classical model although magnetic\nanisotropies are likely to be relevant for a description of\nthe experiments. RB4 crystallize in the tetragonal structure with space group P 4/mbm. R ions are placed in\n\n\f2\nthe (001) plane on a sublattice which consists of R-R\ndimers that are alternatively orthogonal along the [110]\naxis. This sublattice is again topologically equivalent to\nthe SSL (see Fig. 1 right panel).\nMagnetization plateaux were found for various rational values of the saturated magnetization. Due to its\nlarge total magnetic moment (J = 6) TbB4 can be\nconsidered as a classical system. Several magnetization\nplateaux were found, including the magnetization values\nM/Msat = 1/3 and 1/2.16,22 Ref. 17 shows that ErB4\n(with total magnetic moment J = 15/2) exhibits a magnetization plateau at M/Msat = 1/2 for both h//[001]\nand h//[100]. The compound TmB4 also presents several magnetization plateaux for h//[001].18,19,20,21\nIn this paper we investigate classical Heisenberg spins on\nthe SSL under a magnetic field. Note that we are not\naware of any previous study of the classical limit in the\npresence of a magnetic field, although some of the first\nstudies of the zero-field properties of the SSL did start\nfrom this limit.2,23 In Section II we discuss the classical ground state at zero temperature and then study the\nrole of thermal fluctuations as a scenario for the appearance of a M/Msat = 1/3 plateau. Note that this plateau\narises only for non-zero temperature and is not related to\nan energy-driven mechanism. To emphasize this difference and the fact that this plateau is not completly flat,\nwe refer to it as a pseudo-plateau in the following. Then\nin Section III we focus on the special ratio J \u2032 /J = 1/2\nand study by means of classical Monte-Carlo simulations\nthe influence of the system size and of the temperature\non those pseudo-plateaux. A phase diagram is obtained\nand we draw a parallel between the SSL and the classical\ntriangular lattice. Finally, in Section IV we show that a\nsmall modification \u01eb of the ratio of the magnetic couplings\nJ \u2032 /J = 1/2 + \u01eb slightly changes the phase diagram but\nstill allows a pseudo-plateau to exist at M/Msat = 1/3.\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nWe study the SSL in the classical limit. Heisenberg\nspins are represented by simple vectors Si with ||Si || = 1.\nThe magnetic field is applied to the z\u2212axis, h = hez\n(i.e. h//[001] in the experiments carried out on RB4 ).\nThe sums are taken over nearest neighbor pairs according\nto the edges of the squares with magnetic coupling J \u2032\nand over the diagonals with diagonal couplings J. The\nHamiltonian is given by:\nH=\n\nN\nN\nN\nX\nJ\u2032 X\nhX z\nS .\nSi * Sj +\nSi * Sj \u2212\nJ\nJ i i\nedges\n\n(1)\n\ndiagonal\n\nBy minimizing the classical energy in the absence of applied magnetic field the lowest energy configuration is\nfound to be coplanar.2 It is N\u00e9el ordered for J \u2032 /J \u2265 1,\n\u2032\u0001\nelse it is a spiral state with an angle \u03c6 = \u03c0 \u00b1 arccos JJ\nbetween nearest-neighbor spins. Those two possible optimum values for \u03c6 give a discrete chiral degeneracy to each\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) Lowest energy configuration of the SSL\nin the (001) plane for the particular ratio J \u2032 /J = 1/2. The\n12 spins unit cell is represented in bold clear lines. Left\npanel: The 120 \u25e6 structure with three kinds of spins orientation. Right panel: The U U D state at M/Msat = 1/3.

The choice of the angles \u03c6 in two neighboring\ntriangles determines the direction of the helix. Four helices are possible which creates a supplementary four-fold\ndiscrete degeneracy in addition to the continuous one.2\nA.\n\nClassical ground state at T = 0\n\nA particular ratio of the magnetic couplings allows\nthe Hamiltonian to be expressed as a sum of elementary plaquettes.24,25 In the SSL these are triangles which\nshare edges along the diagonal dimer bonds and otherwise corners. When the diagonal couplings are twice as\nbig as the edge couplings (i.e. J \u2032 /J = 1/2) the Hamiltonian Eq. (1) can be written as a sum over triangles up to\na constant term:\n\u0013\nN\u2206 \u0012 \u2032\nh\nJ 2\n1X\nS\u2206 \u2212 S\u2206 , (J \u2032 /J = 1/2) , (2)\nH\u2206 =\nJ\n2\n3\n\u2206\n\nP\n\nwhere S\u2206 = i\u2208\u2206 Si is the total spin of one triangle and\nN\u2206 is the number of triangles (N\u2206 = N ). The classical\nground state at zero temperature and in the absence of a\nmagnetic field is a coplanar configuration with an angle\n\u03c6 = \u00b12\u03c0/3 between two nearest-neighbor spins. There\nare three possible spin orientations SA , SB , and SC and\nthe unit cell contains 12 sublattices (see Fig. 2 left panel).\nMinimizing the energy on a single triangle, one obtains\nthe constraint:\nS\u2206 =\n\nh\n, (J \u2032 /J = 1/2) .\n3J \u2032\n\n(3)\n\nThe classical ground state is obtained when this constraint is satisfied in every triangle. The saturation field\nz\nhsat is determined by the condition S\u2206\n= 3 which gives\n\u2032\nhsat = 9J . At this value all the spins are aligned with\n\n\f3\n\nz\n\n+\n\nz\n\nz\n\n+\n\nz\n\nFIG. 3: (color online) From left to right: the \"umbrella\" and\nthe \"Up-Up-Down\" states are possible spin configurations at\nM/Msat = 1/3. The \"Y \u2212state\" and the canted state are\nthe quasi-long-range-ordered configurations discussed in Sec.\nIII B.\n\nthe z\u2212axis (\"U U U state\"). We focus on the field range\n0 \u2264 h \u2264 hsat . According to the classical constraint Eq.\n(3) the classical ground state has only the typical global\nrotation as a degeneracy.\nLet us have a closer look at the particular value\nM/Msat = 1/3. The magnetic field to apply is:\nh1/3 = 3J \u2032 , (J \u2032 /J = 1/2) .\n\n(4)\n\nStable configurations at h = h1/3 must verify S\u2206 = ez .\nVery different spin configurations satisfy this requirement: the \"umbrella configuration\" and the \"Up-UpDown\" state (see Fig. 3). In the umbrella configuration\nthe three kinds of spins raise as the field increases and\nthey always have the same projection on the z\u2212axis (at\nz\nz\nz\nM/Msat = 1/3, SA\n= SB\n= SC\n= 1/3). In this case,\nthe picture of the classical ground state with three kinds\nof spin orientations remains until saturation (see Fig. 2\nleft panel). On the other hand the \"Up-Up-Down\" state\n(U U D state) is a collinear state in which each triangle\ncontains two spins Up and one spin Down (see right panel\nof Fig. 2). This classical ground state is required in order\nto have a classical plateau at M/Msat = 1/3.26 One can\neasily show that at zero temperature and M/Msat = 1/3,\nboth configurations, umbrella and U U D, have the same\nclassical energy. Since energetic considerations do not favor the U U D state its existence is restricted to the field\nvalue h1/3 . Hence no magnetization plateau can appear\nat zero temperature.\nMinimizing the energy on triangles naturally leads to\na comparison with the classical triangular lattice, with\nmagnetic coupling J\u2206 between nearest neighbors. This\nlattice was the subject of many theoretical studies.27,28,29\nKawamura and Miyashita29 studied classical Heisenberg\nspins on the triangular lattice in the presence of a magnetic field along the z\u2212axis. They obtained classical constraints that are strictly equivalent to Eq. (3) for the SSL.\nMinimizing the energy of a single triangle they showed\nthat the classical ground state is completely specified by\nthe conditions:\n||SA || = ||SB || = ||SC || = 1 ,\nh\n, (h < hsat ) .\nSA + SB + SC =\n3J\u2206\n\n(5)\n\nThese constraints give information on the magnetization\nprocess of the classical triangular lattice and SSL at zero\ntemperature. The application of the magnetic field does\nnot break the U (1) symmetry of the 120 \u25e6 configuration\nwhich means that the continuous degeneracy of the classical ground state remains. In other terms, at zero temperature and under a magnetic field, the 120 \u25e6 structure\nraises in the umbrella configuration that closes as the field\nincreases and reaches the U U U configuration at saturation.\nFor non-zero temperature the scenario of the magnetization process is completely different. Kawamura28 showed\nthat the non-trivial degeneracy no longer persists on the\ntriangular lattice. Even in the low-temperature limit, the\nmost favorable spin configuration is determined not only\nby its energy but also by the density of states just above\nthe ground state. This entropic selection is responsible\nfor the appearance of new phases which will be detailed\nfor the SSL in Section II B.\n\nB.\n\nEffect of thermal fluctuations\n\nThe Monte Carlo (MC) simulations reported in Sec. III\nbelow indicate that, at finite temperature, the U U D state\nis the favored configuration for a magnetic field range below and until h = h1/3 . This is possible if thermal fluctuations raise the entropy of the U U D state relatively to\nadjacent states. Kawamura and Miyashita28,29 showed\nthat in the case of the triangular lattice non-zero temperature lifts the degeneracy of the classical ground state in\nthe presence of a magnetic field. Also on the SSL only a\ndiscrete degeneracy due to the possible chiralities of the\ntriangles remains.\nThe selection by thermal fluctuations of particular\nstates among a degenerate manifold is called Order by\ndisorder.30,31,32 This selection mechanism is known to be\nat work in various frustrated systems such as the frustrated square lattice,24 the kagome lattice,33,34,35,36 or\nthe checkerboard lattice.25\nWe will see that the SSL differs in some respects from the\naforementioned cases. It is nevertheless useful to recall\nsome relevant features of the order-by-disorder selection\nbefore presenting the technical details of our analytical\nstudy of the thermal selection of the U U D state. Under\na small but non-zero temperature the classical spin-wave\nspectrum of the selected state has the particularity to\npresent soft modes. The energy of those modes is quartic\nin spin deviations instead of quadratic. Therefore they\ncontribute less than \"normal\" modes to the free energy\nand it is clear that a state with more soft modes will be\nfavored. More precisely, let us consider a state with classical energy E0 that has N4 soft modes and N2 = N \u2212 N4\n\"normal\" modes. The free energy is given by:\nF \u223c E0 \u2212 T\n\n\u0012\n\nN2\nN4\n+\n2\n4\n\n\u0013\n\nln(T ) .\n\n(6)\n\n\f4\n\n(7)\nSi (ri ) = (\u01ebxi (ri ), \u01ebyi (ri ), 1 \u2212 \u03b1i (ri )) ,\n\u0001\nwhere \u03b1i = 1/2 (\u01ebxi )2 + (\u01ebyi )2 is verifying the condition\n||Si || = 1 up to quadratic order.\nFollowing Ref. 34 the Hamiltonian is expanded in spin\ndeviations from the U U D state:\nX\nH = EUUD +\nHn ,\n(8)\nn\u22652\n\nwhere EUUD is the classical energy and Hn \u223c O(\u01ebn ). Up\nto second order in those fluctuations the Hamiltonian\nbecomes, in Fourier space:\nX\nH2 =\nVvt (\u2212k) M Vv (k) .\n(9)\nk,v=x,y\n\nFluctuations are applied to the 12 sublattices of the unit\ncell and the vectors Vvt (\u2212k) (v = x, y) read:\nVvt (\u2212k)\n\n=\n\n(\u01eb\u0303v1 (\u2212k), . . . , \u01eb\u0303v12 (\u2212k))\n\n.\n\n(10)\n\nM is a 12 \u00d7 12 matrix. Fluctuations act exactly the\nsame way on the x- and y-components and as a consequence the matrices are the same for fluctuations in the\nx- and y-directions. Eigenvalues should be determined\nby solving an order 12 polynomial which cannot be done\nanalytically. However, we can determine the soft modes\nfrom the zeroes of the determinant which reads:\ndet(M) \u221d (\u22122 + 3 cos kx \u2212 3 cos 2kx + cos 3kx + cos ky )2 .\n(11)\nThis result shows that we have lines of soft modes, but\nno full branch. Yet this result is still exceptional since\nusually one finds only a finite number of soft modes.\nWe further performed numerical diagonalization of M at\neach point in the Fourier space (kx , ky ). For each point\nthe smallest eigenvalue was selected in order to obtain\na picture of the ground state. Fig. 4 shows the picture\nobtained over a couple of Brillouin zones. The darkest\nregions correspond to the lowest points and we indeed\nobserve lines of soft modes corresponding to a cancellation of the quadratic energy. Note that the corresponding\nzero eigenvalues are non-degenerate. The height of the\nbarriers between those lines is \u2206E \u2248 0.1 meaning that\n\n6.283\n\n0.09\n0.08\n0.07\n\n3.1415\n\n0.06\nky\n\nRef. 34 details how soft modes should be enumerated and\nhow they affect the specific heat. In a system with no\nsoft modes each degree of freedom brings a contribution\nof kB /2 to the specific heat. In the quadratic approximation the contribution of the soft modes is zero. Taking\ninto account higher orders by adding quartic contributions each soft mode adds kB /4.\nWe calculated the spectrum of the U U D state in the\nquadratic approximation in thermal fluctuations by applying small deviations on the spin coordinates from the\ncollinear U U D state.36 At zero temperature the 12 sublattices of the unit cell presented in Fig. 2 (right panel)\nare collinear with the z\u2212axis. Under fluctuations their\nnew coordinates are expressed in their own frame as:\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\n-3.1415\n\n0.02\n0.01\n\n-6.283\n-3.1415\n\n0\n0\n\n3.1415\n\nkx\nFIG. 4: (color online) Lowest branch of the fluctuation matrix M above the U U D state in Fourier space (kx , ky ). In\nthe darkest regions, the black lines represent the lines of soft\nmodes whose analytical expressions are given in the text.\n\nlow-temperature behavior is expected to appear only for\nT . 0.1. The analytical expression of the lines of soft\nmodes can be obtained by finding relations between kx\nand ky so that the determinant Eq. (11) vanishes:\n!\n\u221a\n1 (1 \u00b1 i 3)(1 \u2212 u(ky ))\n,\n(12)\n\u2212\nkx = \u00b1 arccos\n2\n4u(ky )\np\nwhere u(ky ) = ( cos2 ky \u2212 1 \u2212 cos ky )\u22121/3 .\nFollowing the calculations performed by Champion and\nHoldsworth for the pyrochlore lattice,37 the specific heat\nCh per spin is predicted to be given by:\n1\nCh\n=1\u2212\u03b3 ,\nN kB T\nL\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03b3 is a constant related with the number of lines of\nsoft modes.\nThe manifold of soft modes for the SSL with magnetic\ncouplings verifying J \u2032 /J = 1/2 scales like L in a L2\nFourier space. Eq. (13) clearly shows that the drop in\nthe specific heat, or in other terms the effect of the soft\nmodes, will disappear in the thermodynamic limit.\nThe lines of soft modes are reminiscent of the q = 0\nU U U D state in the frustrated square lattice.24 However,\nthe precise mechanism is somewhat different in the SSL\nsince here the soft modes do not correspond to continuous deformations of the ground state. Nevertheless, the\nU U D state is still selected for entropic reasons, like in\nthe triangular lattice:28,29 the soft modes simply result\nin a free energy which is lower for the U U D state than\nfor non-collinear phases. The triangular lattice with classical Heisenberg spins does not have full branches of soft\nmodes either, but the manifold of soft modes consists of\n\n\f5\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n1\n\n0.15\nM /M sat\n\nd M /d h\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n\n1/3\n\n0.05\n\n= 0.01\n= 0.02\n= 0.04\n= 0.06\n= 0.08\n= 0.1\n\n1\nM /M sat\n\n0.25\n\nd M /d h\n\nL=6\nL = 12\nL = 18\nL = 24\nL = 30\n\n1/3\n\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\nh\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n\n5\n\nh\nFIG. 5: (color online) Susceptibility and magnetization (inset)\nof the SSL at J \u2032 /J = 1/2 and T = 0.02 for various system\nsizes.\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nh\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nh\nFIG. 6: (color online) Susceptibility and magnetization (inset)\nof the SSL at J \u2032 /J = 1/2 and for a system size L = 18.

Still, the triangular lattice exhibits pseudo-plateaux at finite temperature.\n\nIII.\n\nMONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS\n\nWe performed MC simulations using a standard singlespin flip Metropolis algorithm.38 As a small refinement,\nwe propose changes of the spin projection along and perpendicular to the field direction independently. Pseudorandom numbers were generated by the Mersenne39\nTwister random number generator.\nWe studied square\n\u221a\nsamples (Lx = Ly = L = N ) with periodic boundary\nconditions. Their sizes are chosen so as to be commensurate with the 12 sublattice unit cell represented in Fig. 2:\nL = 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30. In the simulations the diagonal\ncoupling J is set to 1. MC simulations computed in particular the magnetization, the susceptibility \u03c7 = dM/dh\nand the specific heat Ch . All physical quantities are normalized per spin. Data was collected with up to \u223c 107\nMC sweeps per point depending on the size and temperature considered. In order to insure thermal equilibrium,\na comparable amount of sweeps was discarded before collecting data. Both field and temperature scans were run.\nError bars are determined from independent MC runs\n(the average number of simulations per point is five).\n\nA.\n\nMagnetization pseudo-plateau at M/Msat = 1/3\n\nFig. 5 shows the susceptibility and the magnetization as a function of the system size at J \u2032 /J = 1/2 for\nT = 0.02. A pseudo-plateau is observed in the magnetization curve at M/Msat = 1/3. Following the previous\nanalytical discussion this means that the U U D configuration is thermally selected at this temperature. Its\nexistence is no longer strictly limited to one single point\nat h = h1/3 , but it exists for a range of magnetic field\n\nvalues below and until h1/3 . The width of those pseudoplateaux increases with system size. One clearly observes\nthree peaks in the susceptibility curves which become\nsharper and higher as the system size increases. The two\nfirst ones indicate the presence of phase transitions to the\nU U D state while the last one corresponds to the transition to saturation.\nThe stability of the susceptibility peak positions and\nheight for L \u2265 18 show that L = 18 captures reasonably well the behavior of the plateau region in the thermodynamic limit. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the temperature on the susceptibility and magnetization for a\nL = 18 system. The magnetization curve should tend to\na straight line as the temperature decreases. This is confirmed by the MC simulations: at very low temperature\n(see T = 0.01 in Fig. 6) the pseudo-plateau is extremely\nsmall. The susceptibility presents two very sharp peaks\naround h1/3 . As the temperature increases the pseudoplateau becomes broader, which confirms the entropic\nselection of the U U D state in the plateau phase. Finally\nhigher temperature (see T = 0.1 in Fig. 6) destroys it.\nThe peaks in the susceptibility curve become rounded\nand then completely disappear.\nThe specific heat Ch (Fig. 7) exhibits a first peak attributed to the transition from the collinear U U D state\nto a low magnetic field state that will be detailed in Section III B. MC simulations on system sizes L = 6 \u2212 42\nshowed that the height of this peak scales with increasing system size as \u223c L\u03b1/\u03bd with \u03b1/\u03bd \u226a 1 which suggests\na continuous phase transition.Note that the MC simulations presented in Fig. 7 were performed at T = 0.02\nwhich is a too high temperature to have a convergence of\nthe specific heat towards 1 as the system size increases,\nas one would expect from the equipartition theorem and\nEq. 13. The second peak corresponds to the transition\nto saturation.\n\n\f6\n5\n\n1.75\n\nL=6\nL = 18\nL = 30\n\n1.5\n\n4\n\nCANTED STATE\n\nh\n\nCh\n\n3\n\n1.25\n\n1st peak of \u03c7\n2nd peak of \u03c7\n3r d peak of \u03c7\n1st peak of \u03c7\n2nd peak of \u03c7\n\nhsat\n\n2\n\nh 1/3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.75\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nh\nFIG. 7: (color online) Specific heat of the SSL with J \u2032 /J =\n1/2 at T = 0.02 and for various system sizes.\n\nB.\n\nPhase diagram for the ratio J \u2032 /J = 0.5\n\nNext we discuss the domain of existence of the U U D\ncollinear phase in the (h, T ) plane. Up to 5 MC simulations per point were performed on a L = 12 (N = 144)\nsystem which gives a good qualitative picture of the position and nature of the phases. Both temperature and\nmagnetic field scans were performed. The boundaries of\nthe phases are determined by the positions of the peaks\nin the susceptibility \u03c7. Fig. 8 shows this schematic phase\ndiagram in the plane (h, T ). Numbers are attributed to\nthe three susceptibility peaks observed from low to high\nmagnetic field in magnetic field scans of Fig. 6 (curves\nwith circles) and to the two peaks from low to high temperature in temperature scans (curves with triangles).\nWe simulated by means of MC the spin texture for\nL = 12, 18 systems in order to obtain a qualitative picture\nof the spin configuration in the phases below and above\nthe U U D phase. Fig. 9 shows some snapshots of the spin\nconfigurations in a L = 12 system at T \u223c 0.003. Like in\nthe classical triangular lattice the magnetization process\nat finite temperature is very different from the one at\nzero temperature. The phase in the low-field region is\nthe \"Y configuration\" (see Fig. 3). In this configuration\neach triangle contains two spins above the (x, y) plane\n(red dark circles in Fig. 9) while the last one is pointing down and is almost collinear with the z\u2212axis (yellow\nlight circles in Fig. 9). This state is characterized by a\nsingle angle between the two spins pointing in the positive\nz\u2212direction. The Y configuration breaks the rotational\nsymmetry around the z\u2212axis and as a consequence of the\nMermin-Wagner theorem40 cannot be long-range ordered\nfor T > 0. The spins above the (x, y) plane are at most\nquasi-long-range-ordered with correlation functions that\ndecay algebraically. On the other hand one can expect\nlong-range order on the remaining down spin sublattices.\nThen in a magnetic field range below and until h1/3 the\ncollinear U U D state is the lowest energy configuration\n(see center panel of Fig. 9). As the temperature goes to\n\n0\n0.0001\n\nUUD STATE\n\nY STATE\nT\u2217\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nT\nFIG. 8: Phase diagram of the classical SSL for the ratio of\nthe magnetic couplings J \u2032 /J = 1/2.\n\nzero, the width of this phase converges to a single point\nat exactly h = h1/3 = 3/2 which is in complete agreement with the analytical prediction. This phase does not\nbreak the U (1) symmetry and hence true long-range order is realized.\nIn the high-field region the ground state is the \"canted\nstate\" (see Fig. 3). In this state the spins down are raising\nas the magnetic field increases while the spins up are no\nlonger collinear with the z\u2212axis. This state is characterized by two angles: one between the z\u2212axis and the two\nspins above the (x, y) plane and one between the z\u2212axis\nand the single spin below the (x, y) plane (see bottom\npanel of Fig. 9). As in the Y phase, at most quasi-longrange order is expected at finite temperature.\nIn the higher field region the system reaches saturation and all spins are pointing up collinearly with the\nz\u2212axis (U U U state). The zero-temperature limit of the\nsaturation field is hsat = 9/2, as derived in Section II A.\nAt higher temperature the system enters the disordered\nparamagnetic phase. The highest temperature where the\nU U D state still exists T \u2217 is estimated as T \u2217 \u2248 0.17.\nNote that the classical spin-wave spectrum contains energy barriers between lines of soft modes of the same\norder of magnitude. Hence this temperature agrees with\nthe range of temperatures in which we expected the lowtemperature behavior to appear.\nThe phase diagram of the SSL with the particular coupling ratio J \u2032 /J = 1/2 presents similarities with the\none of the classical triangular29 and kagome35 lattices.\nWatarai et al.41 suggested that in the classical triangular lattice with Heisenberg spins these transitions could\nbe of the second order. The scaling of the specific heat\nshown in Fig. 7 is in agreement with a continuous transition. We propose that a Berezinski\u0131\u0306-Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition42,43,44 takes place as the system enters the\nU U D phase. Following what was obtained in the case\nthe triangular lattice, the transition from the collinear\nU U D state to the disordered phase should belong to the\nuniversality class of the three-state Potts model.45,46\n\n\f7\n0.35\n\nL=6\nL = 12\nL = 18\nL = 24\nL = 30\n\n0.3\n\n1\n\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n\nM /M sat\n\nd M /d h\n\n0.25\n\n0.05\n\n1/3\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nh\n\n0\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nh\nFIG. 10: (color online) MC results for the susceptibility and\nmagnetization (inset) of the SSL at J \u2032 /J = 0.4 and T = 0.02\nfor various system sizes.\n\nIV.\n\nFIG. 9: (color online) Snapshots of the MC simulations of the\nspin texture in a L = 12 system for J \u2032 /J = 1/2 and T \u223c 0.003.\nThe circles represent the projection on the z\u2212axis, red (dark\ngray) if S z > 0, yellow (light gray) otherwise.

In the following discussion we use\nMonte Carlo results for J \u2032 /J = 0.4 (i.e. \u01eb = \u22120.1). We\nobserved that qualitatively similar behavior also appears\nfor the other sign of \u01eb.\nWe performed MC simulations on systems sizes L =\n6, 12, 18, 24, and 30. Data were collected with up to\n107 MC steps per point. Fig. 10 shows the susceptibility and the magnetization as a function of the magnetic\nfield at the same temperature as in Fig. 5 for the ratio\nJ \u2032 /J = 1/2. The susceptibility still presents two peaks\naround M/Msat = 1/3 and a pseudo-plateau is observed\nin the magnetization curve. Therefore one can expect\nU U D to be the selected configuration at T = 0.02 even\nfor ratios J \u2032 /J = 1/2 + \u01eb. According to the position of\nthe peaks of the susceptibility, the width of the pseudoplateau increases as the system size increases.\nFollowing exactly the same calculations as the ones presented in Section II B for J \u2032 /J = 1/2, we applied thermal fluctuations on top of the U U D state for the ratio\nJ \u2032 /J = 0.4. The fluctuations matrix M exhibits negative\neigenvalues which means that the U U D configuration is\nno longer the favored configuration in the quadratic approximation for the spin deviations. In other words, the\ncollinear U U D state is no longer selected at \"very low\ntemperatures\" for J \u2032 /J 6= 1/2. We used MC simulations\nin order to obtain a picture of the spin configuration in\nthe temperature range T < 0.001. It turns out that the\nfavored configuration is an umbrella that is closing until saturation as the magnetic field increases. At \"higher\ntemperature\" (T \u2265 0.01) we observed that for h \u2248 h1/3\nthe system enters the U U D phase. This \"high temperature\" regime is not analytically accessible with lowestorder thermal fluctuations.\nFollowing the same procedure as in Sec. III B, we performed magnetic field and temperature scans in order to\n\n\f8\nV.\n\n4\n1 st peak of \u03c7\n2 nd peak of \u03c7\n3 r d peak of \u03c7\n1 st peak of \u03c7\n2 nd peak of \u03c7\npeak in C h\n\n3\n\nh\n\nUMBRELLA\n2\n\nh 1/3\n\nUUD\n\n1\n\n0\n0.0001\n\n0.001\n\n0.01\n\n0.1\n\nT\nFIG. 11: (color online) Phase diagram for the SSL for the\nratio J \u2032 /J = 0.4.\n\ndetermine the region in which the U U D state survives.\nFig. 11 shows a schematic phase diagram for the SSL at\nJ \u2032 /J = 1/2 + \u01eb = 0.4 in the (h, T ) plane. Five separate\nsimulations per point were performed on L = 12 systems. MC data were collected up to 107 MC steps per\npoint. Temperature (circles) and field (triangles) scans\nwere performed with the same ordering of the susceptibility peaks as in Section III B. As one expects from the\nanalytical arguments, the resulting phase diagram differs\nfrom the case J \u2032 /J = 1/2. In the lowest temperature\nregion, the system undergoes the same kind of magnetization process as at zero temperature: the coplanar spiral\nbecomes an umbrella configuration as the magnetic field\nincreases. The angle between two nearest-neighbor spins\nis \u03c0 \u00b1 arccos (1/2 + \u01eb). Hence, the spiral at zero temperature is not exactly commensurate with a 12 spin unit\ncell. However, as the temperature increases the spin positions fluctuate and a 12 sublattice unit cell is recovered\nin average on the spin positions. Hence we suggest that\nthe transition from the umbrella to the phases with 12\nsublattices (squares in Fig. 11) is an incommensuratecommensurate phase transition.\nAt higher temperature we recover the three phases that\nwere obtained for J \u2032 /J = 1/2 in different magnetic field\nregions. In the low-field region we still obtain the \"Y\nconfiguration\" and in the high-field region, before saturation, the \"canted state\". The long-range-ordered U U D\ncollinear state still survives in a small region between\nthe two aforementioned phases. For T < 0.01 the U U D\nphase is expected to become narrower as the temperature\ndecreases (dashed bold lines). A precise determination\nhow the four phases merge (black circle) is beyond the\nscope of this work.\n\n\u2217\n1\n\nElectronic address: moliner@lpt1.u-strasbg.fr\nH. T. Diep, ed., Frustrated Spin Systems (World-Scientific,\n2004).\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe studied the magnetization process of the ShastrySutherland lattice in the classical limit. We found a\npseudo-plateau at 1/3 of the saturated magnetization\nwhich corresponds to a collinear U U D state. The spectrum of spin waves above this state has lines of soft\nmodes, like the q = 0 U U U D state on the frustrated\nsquare lattice.24 However, in contrast to the frustrated\nsquare lattice, the M/Msat = 1/3 ground state of the\nSSL has no local continuous degeneracies. Therefore, the\nselection mechanism of the U U D state in the SSL is more\nsimilar to the triangular lattice.28,29 It may be interesting to note that also the magnetization curve of the Ising\nmodel on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice exhibits exactly\none plateau with M/Msat = 1/3.47,48\nFurthermore, we performed Monte-Carlo simulations and\nobtained a phase diagram in the (h, T ) plane for the\nparticular magnetic coupling ratio J \u2032 /J = 1/2. We\nconfirmed that the Shastry-Sutherland lattice behaves\nlike the triangular lattice and it presents two quasi-longrange-ordered phase below and above the long-rangedordered U U D phase. We also showed that the pseudoplateau survives for a small variation \u01eb of the magnetic\ncoupling ratio around J \u2032 /J = 1/2. The phase diagram was found to present a new incommensurate umbrella phase in the low-temperature region, at least for\nJ \u2032 /J = 0.4.\nIn the future, it would be interesting to compute order\nparameters35 and characterize the phase transitions of\nthe SSL with classical Heisenberg spins. Furthermore,\nmagnetic anisotropies are also expected to be important\nfor the rare-earth tetraborides.16,17,18,19,20,21,22 Finally, it\nhas been observed on some other lattices49,50,51 that coupling to phonons leads to a stabilization of magnetization\nplateaux. It would therefore be interesting to study the\nclassical Heisenberg model coupled to lattice degrees of\nfreedom also on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nD.C.C., A.H., and P.P. would like to thank M.
