After years of search, a promising candidate finally emerged in the spin-1/2 Kagome system\nHerbertsmithite ZnCu3 (OH)6 Cl2 [1, 2, 3]. Despite an antiferromagnetic exchange J \u2248 170 \u223c 190K[4, 5], the system does not order down to 50mK[1, 2, 3]. Theoretically the Dirac-SL is proposed[6] as the ground state of\nthe nearest neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model\non Kagome lattice. Unfortunately the spin susceptibility\n\u03c7s is consistent with \u223c 4% magnetic impurities[4], and\npossible Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction has also been\nproposed[5]. These may explain the hump of the specific\nheat C around 2K and also obscure the C \u221d T 2 and\n\u03c7s \u221d T behaviors predicted by the Dirac-SL. In this paper we propose a unique signature of the Dirac-SL in an\nexternal magnetic field, which can be used to detect the\nDirac-SL phase in experiment and numerical simulations.\nThe Dirac-SL experiences no orbital effect in the external magnetic field\nbecause it is an insulator. The Zeeman\n~\n~ *P S\ncoupling g\u03bcB B\ni i polarizes spin along the field direction, breaks time reversal and breaks SU (2) spin rotation\n~ as zdown to U (1). Let us denote the direction of B\ndirection (note that the xy-plane does not have to be the\nplane of the two-dimensional Kagome system). We find\nthat the Dirac-SL will spontaneously break the remaining Sz -U (1) and form a staggered magnetization M (see\nFig.2(b)) in the xy-plane which scales with B: M \u223c B \u03b1 .\nThe positive exponent \u03b1 is an intrinsic universal number\nof the Dirac-SL phase and in principle calculable.\nThis unique signature of the Dirac-SL can be compared\nwith a regular co-planer antiferromagnetic (AF) ordered\nphase. In a small magnetic field B, the magnetization\nof the regular AF phase would rotate into the xy-plane\nto maximize the susceptibility along the B direction. As\nB is tuned to zero, the in-plane magnetization remains\nfinite. In contrast, for the Dirac-SL we predict that M\n\nvanishes as B \u03b1 . This suggests that the Dirac-SL can be\nviewed as an AF phase whose long-range AF order has\nbeen destroyed by the quantum fluctuations.\nWe begin with writing down the the low energy theory\nof the Dirac-SL[6], which includes four flavors of fermions\ncoupled with compact U (1) gauge field in 2+1 dimension\n(QED3 ):\nZ\nX\n\u00021\n\u03c8\u0304+\u03c3 (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03bc ) \u03c4\u03bc \u03c8+\u03c3\nS = dx3 2 (\u03b5\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bc a\u03bd )2 +\ng\n\u03c3\nX\n\u0003\n+\n(1)\n\u03c8\u0304\u2212\u03c3 (\u2202\u03bc \u2212 ia\u03bc ) \u03c4\u03bc \u03c8\u2212\u03c3 + * * * ,\n\u03c3\n\nwhere the two-component fermionic Dirac spinon fields\nare denoted by \u03c8\u00b1\u03c3 , where \u00b1 label the two inequivalent\nnodes and \u03c3 the up/down spins.\nThe spinon carries spin-1/2 and charge-0, and couples\nto the external magnetic field only by the Zeeman effect.\nIn the presence of a magnetic field, the simplest guess is\nthat the Dirac points will change into Fermi pockets due\nto Zeeman splitting. We will call this state Fermi pocket\nstate (FP). But, can there be other states whose energy\nmay be lower?\nThe FP state has many gapless spinon excitations near\nthe Fermi pockets and in general not energetically favorable. One natural way to gap out the Fermi pocket state\nis to induce (internal) gauge fluxes and develop Landau\nlevels. Here we take advantage of the appearance of zero\nenergy Landau levels when Dirac particles are subject to\na magnetic field, as is well known in the recent studies\nof graphene[7, 8]. If the gauge flux is adjusted in such a\nway that the zero-energy Landau level is fully filled for\nup-spin, and fully empty for down-spin, then the spinons\nare fully gapped (Fig.1). We will call this state Landau\nlevel state(LL).\nIn the following we show that LL state has lower energy\nthan FP state. We first compare the energies of LL state\nand FP state at the mean-field level (ignoring the gauge\nfluctuation) with fixed Sz polarization. We set aside the\nZeeman energy which is common between the two states.\n\n\f2\n\nFP\n\nLL\n\nFIG. 1: The The spinons is gapless in FP state with an\nelectron-like Fermi pocket for spin up spinons and hole-like\npocket for spin down spinons. The spinons are fully gapped\nin the LL state. Each Landau level is doubly degenerate due\nto two inequivalent Dirac nodes.\n\nThe density of spin imbalance is:\nN\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193\n1\n\u2206N\n=\n=4*\n\u2206n =\nA\nA\n4\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bcB B\nvF\n\n\u00132\n\nand the mean-field energy density is found to be\n\u221a\nFP\n\u2206EMF\n2 \u03c0vF\n3\nFP\n\u2206eMF =\n=\n(\u2206n) 2 ,\nA\n3\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere N\u2191 and N\u2193 are the number of up and down spins,\n\u2206E is the energy increase compared to Dirac point state,\nA is the system area, B is the magnetic field, and vF is\nthe mean-field Fermi velocity. The factor 4 in Eq.(2) is\nfrom the fact that there are two spin degeneracy and two\nnodal degeneracy. We choose our units such that ~ = 1.\nTo make sure the LL state have the same spin imbalance as the FP state, each Landau level should contain\n\u2206nA/2 states, i.e. the induced gauge magnetic field b\nb\n, where the 2\u03c0 is gauge flux quansatisfies \u2206n = 2 * 2\u03c0\ntum. Since at the mean-field level the internal gauge field\ncosts no energy, the energy of the mean-field LL state is\njust the difference between the sum of the energies of all\nnegative landau levels, and the filled Fermi sea:\n!\nZ\n\u221e\nb X\u221a\ndk 2\nLL\n\u2206eMF = 4vF \u2212\n2nb \u2212\n(\u2212k)\n2\u03c0 n=1\n(2\u03c0)2\n=\n\n\u03b6( 3 )\u2206n3/2 vF\n\u03b6( 23 )b3/2 vF\n\u221a\n= 2 \u221a\n.\n2\u03c0 2\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nThe same result was obtained in Ref [9, 10].

The answer\nis negative and the difference is that the physical elec2\ntromagnetic field has an energy cost of f\u03bc\u03bd\n. Furthermore\nthe field is three dimensional and the magnetic field must\nform closed lines. The magnetic flux would be divided\ninto domains of size R with opposite signs. The size R\ncan be estimated by minimizing the total energy, which\nis the sum of the magnetic field p\nenergy \u223c B 2 R3 and the\nLandau level energy gain \u223c \u2212vF ~eB/c BR2 /\u03a60 where\n\u03a60 = hc\ne is the flux quantum. The optimal R\u2217 is found\n\nFIG. 2: (color online) (a) We convert the data in Table I\ninto energy density \u2206e and spin imbalance density \u2206n (units\ndefined in text), and plot them together with the fitted scaling\nform \u2206e = a\u2206n3/2 + b\u2206n2 . (b): The XY spin order in the\nLL state. We also present the relative phase of Si+ operator\ncomputed by projected landau level state in unit of \u03c0 (see\nEq.(7)). Note that we fix the left-bottom corner site as the\nsite i in Eq.(7), and scan the site j for the nine sites depicted.\nBR2\n\n2\n\ne\n1\nto satisfy \u03a60\u2217 \u223c (\u03b1 vcF )2 , where \u03b1 = ~c\n= 137\nis the fine\nstructure constant. This means that the flux through the\nentire domain is \u223c 10\u22127 \u03a60 , which is not self consistent\nwith the condition that there is at least one flux quantum\nthrough the domain to support Landau levels.\nTo include the effect of gauge fluctuations and to go\nbeyond the mean field theory, we will use the Gutzwiller\nprojected wavefunction to calculate the energies of LL\nand FP states. To obtain the Gutzwiller projected\nwavefunction we first write down\nHamilP the mean-field\n\u2020\n\u03c7\nf\nf\n,\nwhere\nfi\u03c3\ntonian on lattice: Hmean =\nij ij i\u03c3 j\u03c3\nare the fermionic spinons. The mean-field ground state\n|\u03a8mean (\u03c7ij )i with mean-field parameters \u03c7ij is a spin\nsinglet. The projected wavefunction |\u03a8prj (\u03c7ij )i =\nP |\u03a8mean (\u03c7ij )i removes the Q\nunphysical states and becomes a spin state; here P = i (1\u2212ni\u2191 ni\u2193 ) is the projection operator ensuring one fermion per site. The physical\nobservables can be measured on |\u03a8prj (\u03c7ij )i by a Monte\nCarlo approach[11]. The Dirac-SL is characterized by \u03c7ij\nsuch that |\u03c7ij | = \u03c7 is a bond independent constant and\nthere are \u03c0 fluxes through the hexagonal plaquettes and\n0 fluxes through the triangular plaquettes[6]. Note that\nthe projected Dirac-SL state has no tunable parameter\nsince \u03c7 only gives the wavefunction an overall factor. On\na 16x16 unit cell lattice, the energetics of the FP and LL\nstates are given in Table I.\nIs the \u2206e \u223c \u2206n3/2 law still valid after projection? The\nanswer is positive because the Sz and energy are conserved and have no anomalous dimension.

The FP states has no total gauge flux\nflux quanta\nthrough the sample, while the LL state has \u2206N\n2\nthrough the sample which is uniformly distributed in the triangular and hexagonal plaquettes.\n\nEq.(5) we are able to read off the effective fermi velocity\n\u221a\nvF\u2217 = 3*0.33(2)\n= 0.28(2) Ja\n~ by fitting to the free fermion\n2 \u03c0\nresult Eq.(3). vF\u2217 is almost twice the mean-field value\nvF = \u221aa\u03c7\nwith \u03c7 = 0.221J[12]. For Herbertsmithite this\n2~\n\u2217\nmeans vF = 4.9*103m/s assuming J = 200K. This is very\nclose to the fermi velocity we found by a projected band\nstructure study [13], where only one particle-hole excitation is considered. The closeness of the two results imply\nthat the gauge interactions between many particle-hole\nexcitations may only give small corrections for energetics.\nFrom Eq. (5,6) we see that the LL state has a lower\nenergy than the FP state. Therefore the LL state may\nbe the true ground state in the presence of a magnetic\nfield. Due the presence of internal gauge flux, one can\neasily see that the LL state breaks parity (mirror reflection). Surprisingly, it turns out that the LL state breaks\nthe Sz spin rotation as well. To understand this let us\nconsider the low energy collective excitations in the LL\nstate. Since the spinons \u03c8 are gapped due to the Landau\nlevels, the gauge field a\u03bc is the only low energy excitation. We note that the total Hall conductance of the\nspin-up spinons is +1 and the total Hall conductance for\nthe spin-down spinons is \u22121. Thus the total Hall conductance is zero and there is no Chern-Simons term for the\ngauge field a\u03bc . As a result, the dynamics of the gauge\n2\nfield is controlled by the Maxwell term f\u03bc\u03bd\n, which arise\nfrom integrating out high-energy fermions, and gives rise\nto a linear dispersed gapless photon mode.\nTo understand the meaning of the gapless mode, we\nnote that due to the non-zero Hall conductances \u00b11 for\nthe spin-up and spin-down spinons, a flux quantum of the\ngauge field a\u03bc will induce one spin-up spinon and minus\none spin-down spinon. Thus a flux quantum carries a spin\nquantum number Sz = 1. The \"magnetic field\" of a\u03bc is\nnothing but the Sz density. Therefore, the linear gapless\nmode of a\u03bc is actually the density fluctuations of Sz .\nThe appearance of a linear gapless mode of a conserved\ndensity as the only low lying excitation implies that the\ncorresponding symmetry is spontaneously broken in the\nground state.[14, 15] Thus the LL state contains an XY\n\norder: hS + i 6= 0 and the gapless gauge field a\u03bc is the\nGoldstone boson mode of the U (1) symmetry breaking.\nThe \"electric charge\" of a\u03bc gauge field corresponds to\nthe vortex in the XY ordered phase. This duality [16,\n17] between the spin degrees of freedom and the gauge\ndegrees of freedom allows us to translate the physics in\nthe two languages back and forth.\nFor example let us consider the monopole insertion\noperator V \u2020 which inserts a 2\u03c0 gauge flux. V \u2020 flips\none spin\nP as mentioned before and can be expanded as\nV \u2020 \u223c i ei\u03b8i Si+ , where the summation is restricted to\nthe area where the 2\u03c0 flux is inserted. Because V \u2020\nhas long-range correlation in the Coulomb phase, by the\nabove duality, the spin correlation hei\u03b8i Si+ , e\u2212i\u03b8j Sj\u2212 i is\nalso long ranged.\nTo study what kind of the XY spin order that the\nLL state has, we have calculated spin-spin correlation\nfunction hSx,i Sx,j + Sy,i Sy,j i of the projected LL state\nand found the XY ordered pattern as shown in Fig.2(b).\nThis order pattern is referred as the q = 0 magnetic order\nin literatures[18]. To confirm this is indeed the order\npattern we directly compute the relative phases of Si+\noperators in the monopole insertion operator V \u2020 :\n\u03b8j \u2212 \u03b8i = arg\n\n\u0010 hn + 1 flux quanta|P S + P |n flux quantai \u0011\nj\nhn + 1 flux quanta|P Si+ P |n flux quantai\n(7)\n\nwhere |n flux quantai is a LL state with n flux quanta\nand P is the projection operator. To understand this\nformula one should note that P |n + 1 flux quantai =\nV \u2020 P |n flux quantai, where V \u2020 inserts an extra 2\u03c0 flux\n\u2020\nuniformly\n\u223c\nP i\u03b8i + while flipping one spin, and thus V\nS\nwith\nsummation\nover\nall\nsites.\nThese\nrelative\ne\ni\ni\nphases can be computed analytically by choosing proper\ngauge (i.e., gauge that respects physical symmetries). To\nget the answer quickly we perform the Monte Carlo calculation on a finite lattice. For a 6 by 6 unit cell sample\non torus with n = 4, we compute this relative phase for\n9 sites within the three adjacent unit cells and the result\nis given in Fig. 2(b). We find the relative phases are\n0, \u00b1 2\u03c0\n3 alternating between the three sublattices and this\nis exactly the 120\u25e6 q = 0 order pattern.[26]\nBecause V \u2020 is in fact the magnetization operator, we\nconclude that the in-plane staggered magnetization M \u223c\nB \u03b1 scales with the external magnetic field, where the exponent \u03b1 is the scaling dimension of the monopole operator at the Dirac-SL fixed point, because B is dimension-1.\nThis exponent is computable by numerical simulations of\nQED3 or the field theory techniques such as 1/N expansions, and subject to further study.\nSo far we show that the FP state is unstable towards\nthe Sz -broken LL state by numerical arguments. In the\nfollowing we present an analytical argument that the Sz\nsymmetry is broken by studying the low energy effective\ntheory. The FP state is characterized by a electron-like\n\n,\n\n\f4\nFermi pocket of spin up spinons fk\u2191 and a hole-like Fermi\npocket of spin down spinons fk\u2193 . After doing a particlehole transformation on the spin down Fermi pocket only\nfk\u2193 \u2192 h\u2212k\u2191 we have fk\u2191 and h\u2212k\u2191 carry same spin but\nopposite gauge charges. The \"Coulomb\" attraction between the two particles will cause a pairing instability\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2020\nhfk\u2191\nh\u2212k\u2191 i = hfk\u2191\nfk\u2193 i 6= 0. This is a triplet excitonic\ninsulator and this has been discussed in the context of\ngraphene[19, 20]. Besides Coulomb attraction, there is\nalso an Amperean attraction[21] between the currents of\n\u2020\nfk\u2191\nand h\u2020\u2212k\u2191 excitations. The \"Coulomb\" attraction and\nthe Amperean attraction are cooperating for the same\n\u2020\ncondensation. Note that fk\u2191\nfk\u2193 is a Sz spin-1 object.\nFinally we discuss the consequences of this spontaneous spin ordering in experiment. First the in-plane\nq = 0 magnetization pattern and its scaling law M \u223c B \u03b1\nis observable by neutron scattering. Second since the\nground state breaks the parity and Sz rotation symmetry,\nit is separated from the high temperature paramagnetic\nphase by at least one finite temperature phase transition.\nThis transition can be first order or continuous. If the\ntransition is a continuous one that restores the Sz -U (1)\nsymmetry, we expect it to be the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality. Here we simply estimate the transition temperature Tc \u223c \u03bckBBB when \u03bcB B . \u03c7P rj . This is because the\nexternal magnetic field B is the only energy scale if it is\nmuch smaller than the spinon band width \u03c7P rj . Since\nthese are intrinsic properties of the Dirac-SL in magnetic\nfield, they can be used to experimentally detect the possible Dirac-SL ground state in Herbertsmithite and other\nmaterials where a Dirac-SL may be realized. This XY\nspin ordering can also serve a way to detect Dirac-SL\nin numerical studies of the Kagome lattice Heisenberg\nmodel such as exact diagonalization.\nThere are other proposals for the possible nonmagnetic Valence Bond Solid (VBS) ground states in the\nspin-1/2 Heisenberg model on Kagome lattice[22, 23]. If\none of those VBS states is the ground state of Herbertsmithite, it will surely not break Sz symmetry in a small\nmagnetic field because the VBS phases are fully gapped.\nThe Sz symmetry can be broken at an external magnetic\nfield larger than the spin gap due to the triplon condensation. However the XY magnetic order generated in this\nfashion is unlikely to be the q = 0 pattern because the\nVBS orders itself breaks translation and we expect their\nXY orders also breaks translation and have a large unit\ncell. Therefore the spontaneous spin ordering we present\nin this work can be used to differentiate the U (1)-Dirac\nSL from VBS states experimentally.\nIt is likely that in the current Herbertsmithite compound there is an energy scale below which the significant amount of impurities and/or the DzyaloshinskiiMoriya(DM) interaction start to play an important role.\nRecent experiments estimate the strength of the DM interaction to be \u223c 15K[24]. In a strong magnetic field\n\u223c 30 tesla we expect that it is possible to suppress their\n\neffects and reveal the intrinsic property of the Dirac-SL.\nWe thank M. Hermele, T. Senthil and F.-C.

Even when n = 0, namely the pure U (1)-Dirac\nSL state, the relative phase is the same as the n = 4\ndata that we presented up to statistical error. This indicates that the relative phase which we computed is an\n\n\f5\nintrinsic property of the U (1)-Dirac SL, i.e., they are\nthe spin-1 monopole quantum numbers. The Eq.(7) is\na systematic way to compute monopole quantum numbers in any U (1)-Dirac SL. A more detailed discussion on\nthis method is presented as an appendix in Ref.[25]. The\n\nmonopole quantum numbers obtained in this method (see\nFig. 2(b)) are consistent with the results obtained by an\nindependent study on the Dirac SL in zero magnetic field\nbased on symmetry group analysis[13].\n\n\f"}
