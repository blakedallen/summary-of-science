From a theoretical viewpoint,\nergodicity breaking and the resulting non-equilibrium\nprocesses are among the most challenging phenomena\nof glassy dynamics. They are also of considerable\npractical interest, e.g. for polymers, usually applied at\ntemperatures not too far below Tg, where aging can lead\nto degradations of material properties. A famous\napproach for the description of non-equilibrium effects\nin glasses is the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan\n(TNM) formalism [2,3,4]. By introducing the concepts\nof fictive temperature and reduced time, it takes into\naccount the so-called non-linearity of structural\nrelaxation during aging, caused by the fact that the\nrelaxation time itself is time-dependent.\nAging denotes the time-dependent variation of\nphysical quantities when a glass-forming sample\nreapproaches equilibrium after quenching it below Tg.\nThis phenomenon was termed \"physical aging\" by\nStruick [5], to distinguish it from time-dependent\n\n1. Introduction\nThe dynamics of glassy matter exhibits some\ncommon phenomena, which can be considered as\nhallmark features of glassy behavior, namely stretching,\nnon-Arrhenius behavior, and ergodicity breaking [1].\n\"Stretching\" denotes the non-exponential relaxational\nresponse of glassy matter to external perturbations,\nwhich nowadays is commonly ascribed to heterogeneity\nleading to a distribution of relaxation times. NonArrhenius behavior shows up in the temperature\ndependence of dynamic quantities as, e.g., the viscosity\nor the relaxation time and is often assumed to mirror\nincreasingly cooperative molecular motions when\napproaching the glass transition. While those\nphenomena usually are observed at temperatures above\nthe glass temperature Tg, ergodicity breaking arises\nwhen the sample \"falls out of equilibrium\" under\ncooling, which for typical cooling rates occurs close to\nTg. This leaves the sample in a structural state\ncorresponding to equilibrium at a higher temperature\n*\n\nCorresponding author.

The temperature was kept stable better than\n0.1 K for all aging measurements.\n\nprocesses involving chemical reactions; alternative\nexpressions used in literature are \"annealing\" (if the\ntime-dependent changes are intentional) and \"structural\nrelaxation\". Monitoring the time-dependence of\nphysical quantities during physical aging is a\nstraightforward experiment for the investigation of nonequilibrium effects. While there are numerous recent\nreports on physical aging in spin glasses [6] and\npolymers [5,7,8,9], much fewer experiments were\nperformed on canonical glass formers. Especially,\nhaving in mind that dielectric spectroscopy has proven\na key technique for the study of glassy dynamics in\nequilibrium, it is astonishing that investigations of\nglassy non-equilibrium dynamics in low molecularweight glass formers with this technique are relatively\nscarce [3,10,11,12].\nThus, in a recent work [13], we have provided\ndetailed dielectric aging data on a variety of materials,\nbelonging to different classes of glass formers, namely\nmolecular glass formers and a glass-forming ionic melt,\nhaving different fragilities [1,14,15], bonding types, and\nbeing characterized by an excess wing [16] or a welldeveloped Johari-Goldstein \u03b2-relaxation [17]. In that\nwork we have introduced a new type of modeling of the\nexperimental data by using a self-consistent recursive\nformula describing the time-dependence of physical\nproperties of the glass. Using this approach we could\ndemonstrate that the aging dynamics in all these\nmaterials is fully determined by the relaxation time and\nstretching parameter of the \u03b1-relaxation. In the present\nwork, we provide further evidence for the validity of\nthis approach by applying it to further dielectric aging\ndata and by comparing it with an evaluation using a\nconventional stretched exponential ansatz. In addition,\nwe check the data for the scaling properties, predicted\non the basis of the new approach.\n\n3. Results\nFigure 1 shows the time dependence of the dielectric\nloss \u03b5\" of four molecular glass formers, namely\npropylene carbonate (PC, Tg \u2248 159 K, m = 104),\npropylene glycol (PG, Tg \u2248 168 K, m = 52), glycerol\nTg \u2248 185 K, m = 53), and Salol (Tg \u2248 218 K, m = 73),\nafter quenching them to a temperature several K below\nTg. Here m, taken from [15], denotes the so-called\nfragility index [19] giving a measure of the departure\nof the temperature-dependent relaxation time from\nArrhenius-behavior (the lower limit of the fragility\nparameter is m \u2248 16, the most fragile materials have\nm \u2264 200). As revealed by Fig. 1, \u03b5\" of all materials\ncontinuously decreases during aging. For long aging\ntimes t age , the loss of PC and glycerol, which have\nbeen aged up to five weeks, finally becomes constant\nand for PG and Salol it at least shows the tendency to\nsaturate. This indicates that the thermodynamic\nequilibrium state is reached after about 10 6 s.

Especially, fits with eq. (1)\nyield \u03b2 age always much smaller than the equilibrium\nvalue [12,25]. At first glance, this seems difficult to\nunderstand as it is reasonable that the variation of \u03b5\"\nduring aging can be traced back to structural\nrearrangements and thus should be governed by the\nsame dynamics (i.e. relaxation time) and\nheterogeneity (i.e. stretching parameter) as the \u03b1relaxation.

Fits and\nexperimental data match perfectly using this ansatz\n(Fig. 1).\nAs shown in Fig. 3 the resulting fit parameters \u03c4age\nand \u03b2age exhibit a considerable frequency dependence.\nSuch a behavior was also found in the dielectric\n\n3\n\n\fextrapolated \u03b2 \u03b1 are 0.6 (PC) [26], 0.58 (PG) [24],\n0.55 (glycerol) [26], and 0.4 (Salol) [27]. These\nvalues all are significantly larger than the fit results\nfrom eq. (1), shown in Fig. 3(b) and it is not possible\nto fit the data of Fig. 1 with \u03b2 age fixed to the\nextrapolated value [28]. Similar discrepancies also\nshow up if comparing the extrapolated \u03c4a values with\nthose shown in Fig. 3(a) [13].\nThese discrepancies are the manifestation of the\nso-called non-linearity of sub-Tg relaxation, a\nphenomenon addressed already in the famous works\nby Tool and Narayanaswamy [2]. Namely it was\npointed out that during aging, \u03c4age itself is time\ndependent. In the Tool-Narayanaswamy-Moynihan\n(TNM) formalism [2,3,4] this is taken into account\nby tracing back the aging-induced variation of\nphysical quantities to the time-dependence of the socalled fictive temperature Tf and by introducing an\nadditional non-linearity parameter. This formalism\n(and other, mathematically nearly equivalent ones\n[11,29]) has been successfully used to describe\nvarious aging experiments (see, e.g., [4]). However,\nits application is not straightforward, involving the\nnumerical solution of a set of equations and requiring\nsome assumptions for a proper evaluation. Instead, in\n[13] we have proposed a new approach that is much\nsimpler to apply. Considering that the \u03b1-peak frequency\n\u03bdp is a good estimate of the relaxation rate\n\u03bd\u03b1 = 1/(2\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1), the fact that during aging the \u03b1relaxation peak shifts to lower frequencies [13] reflects\nthe decrease of the relaxation rate due to the gradual\ndrop of T f towards the actual temperature. Thus,\nobviously the relaxation rate itself is subjected to\naging. To take into account this time dependence, we\nmake an ansatz for \u03bd\u03b1(t age ), analogous to eq. (1),\nnamely:\n\n\u03bd \u03b1 ( t age ) = 1 (2\u03c0\u03c4 \u03b1 ) =\n\n[\n\n= (\u03bd st \u2212 \u03bd eq ) exp \u2212 (t age 2\u03c0\u03bd \u03b1\n\n) ]+ \u03bd\n\ndiscussed above. Assuming that \u03c4age = \u03c4\u03b1 and\n\u03b2 age = \u03b2\u03b1, the obtained \u03c4age (t age ) is put into eq. (1),\nwhich then is used to fit the measured \u03b5\"(tage ). In [13]\nwe have demonstrated that the aging data obtained on\nfive different glass formers, including PC, PG, and\nglycerol could be well described using this approach.\nThe parameters were kept identical for all\nfrequencies and \u03b2age was fixed to the extrapolated\nequilibrium value. The resulting \u03c4eq values perfectly\nmatch the extrapolated equilibrium \u03c4\u03b1(T) curves.\nIn Fig. 2, we give further evidence for the\napplicability of the modified KWW ansatz by\napplying it to aging data on Salol and PC, the latter\nhaving been measured at a lower temperature than\nthe data presented in [13]. The lines in Fig. 2\ndemonstrate the very good fits that are possible using\nthis ansatz. We want to emphasize that the fits were\nperformed simultaneously for all curves, with the\nparameters of eq. (2) identical for all frequencies.\nThe curves for different frequencies are only\ndistinguished by the parameters \u03b5\"st and \u03b5\"eq. Thus\nthe number of parameters for each curve is four (\u03b2\nbeing fixed to the extrapolated equilibrium value),\nhowever, two of them being common for all curves.\nThus much less parameters are involved, compared\nto the conventional KWW fits of Fig. 1. From the\nfits, we obtain an average relaxation time\n<\u03c4eq> = 3.7\u00d7104 s for Salol, which matches perfectly\nthe published <\u03c4>(T) behavior of Salol [27,31],\nextrapolated to 212 K. For PC at 148.5 K [Fig. 2(a)]\nthe problem arises that this temperature is too far\nbelow T g to come close to thermodynamic\nequilibrium within reasonable times, especially as\nthis is a rather fragile glass former with a very steep\n\u03c4(T) curve close to the glass transition. Thus from the\nfits shown in Fig. 2, it is not possible to gather\nreliable information on the equilibrium relaxation\ntime. Therefore \u03bdeq was fixed to a value of 1\u00d710-9 Hz,\ncorresponding to <\u03c4eq> = 2.4\u00d7104 s, consistent with\nan extrapolation of \u03c4(T) of PC [26,32]. Thus, also for\nthis lower temperature, in PC the aging results can be\ndescribed in full accord with the equilibrium results\non the \u03b1-relaxation, using the new approach\nproposed in [13].\nThe fact that the fits for different frequencies in Fig.\n2 only differ by the values of \u03b5\"st and \u03b5\"eq implies that\nit should be possible to scale the \u03b5\"(t age ) curves for\ndifferent frequencies onto one master curve by\nplotting the quantity (\u03b5\" - \u03b5\"eq) / (\u03b5\"st - \u03b5\"eq) vs. the\naging time. In [13] a nearly perfect scaling was\nreported for glycerol. In Fig. 4 we provide the\nscaling plots for two of the glass formers analyzed in\n[13] and for the new data on PC and Salol of the\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\neq\n\nOne should note here that the time scale\ndetermining the aging of the relaxation rate is given\nby the inverse relaxation rate (i.e. the relaxation\ntime) itself. This ansatz implies that the stretching\n(quantified by \u03b2 \u03b1) remains unaffected by aging, i.e.\nthat time-temperature superposition is valid (this was\nevidenced, e.g., for a polymeric system in [9]). As\nthe shift of Tf during aging is only few K for these\nexperiments, this assumption is justified.\nEquation (2) can be easily solved numerically by\nrecursion [30], resulting in an age dependence of \u03c4\u03b1\nthat takes into account the non-linearity effects\n\n4\n\n\fpresent work. In all cases the scaling works\nreasonably well. The lines show the fit curves, which\nnaturally collapse onto one line in the scaling plots.\nFor PC the scaling is least perfect and for this\nmaterial the scaling plot also reveals systematic\ndeviations of fit and experimental data at the longest\naging times. Probably this is due to the fact that for\nthis rather low temperature, the sample is still far\nfrom equilibrium and the fixed value of \u03c4eq should be\nchosen even larger. However, it is also possible that\nfor larger temperature jumps limitations of the\nintroduced modified KWW approach show up. In this\ncontext it is interesting that in [12], for temperatures\nfar below T g, deviations from the TNM model were\nreported.\n\nthe description of aging data. Our results also\ncorroborate the conclusion drawn in [13] that all\ndynamic processes age in a similar way, determined by\nthe structural \u03b1-relaxation dynamics.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank C.A.

Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the analysis of aging data on a\nnumber of different glass formers using a conventional\nKWW ansatz, performed in the present work, has\nrevealed marked deviations of the resulting relaxation\nparameters from those obtained from equilibrium data.\nIn contrast, the alternative approach proposed in [13],\nwhich takes into account the time dependence of the\nrelaxation time, successfully describes results at\ndifferent frequencies with identical relaxation time and\nstretching parameter, both being fully consistent with\nequilibrium data. In the present work, this approach was\nsuccessfully applied to time-dependent data on Salol\nand PC, giving further evidence for its applicability for\n\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n\n5\n\nM.D. Ediger, C.A.
