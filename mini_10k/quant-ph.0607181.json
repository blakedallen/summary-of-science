Global symmetry transformations and dynamical transformations\nmay be resolved into local unitary operators with respect to certain TPSs and not with respect\nto others. Symmetry-invariant and dynamical-invariant TPSs are defined and various notions of\nentanglement are considered for scattering states.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Mn, 03.65.Nk, 11.30.-j\n\nThe interaction of particle systems via scattering is\na fundamental theoretical and experimental paradigm.\nThe quantum information theory of particle scattering\nis, however, still in its infancy. Results, theoretical and\ncomputational, exist for the entanglement between the\nmomenta [1] or the angular momenta [2] of two particles\ngenerated in scattering, but many problems remain open.\nThe challenges are partly technical due to the greater\ncomplexity of dealing with entanglement in continuous\nvariable systems [3] and partly conceptual as in defining\na measure of entanglement that has meaningful properties under space-time symmetry transformations. See, for\nexample, the literature on spin-entanglement of relativistic particles [4, 5] where different types of entanglement\n(between two particles, between two particles' spins, and\nbetween a single particle's spin and momentum) have\nbeen discussed and occasionally confused.\nIn this letter, we examine how some of these difficulties may be resolved by combining two approaches:\n(1) the generalized tensor product structures (TPSs)\nand observable-dependent entanglement developed by\nZanardi and others [6], and (2) the representation theory of space-time symmetry groups, which has a long\nand fruitful history in quantum mechanics. Using these\nmethods, TPSs for single particle and multi-particle systems are explored. These methods allow one to distinguish between TPSs that are symmetry invariant and/or\ndynamically invariant and TPSs that are not, and, in\nthe latter case, to obtain quantitative expressions for the\nchange of entanglement. The reason why certain TPSs\nhave entanglement measures which are symmetry or dynamically invariant is that the space-time symmetries or\nthe time evolution operator, respectively, act as a product of local unitaries with respect to these TPSs.\nAs an application of these general concepts and methods, we will study non-relativistic elastic scattering of\ntwo particles. In this context, several interesting results\nemerge. First, there are single particle TPSs that are\ninvariant under transformations between inertial reference frames, and these TPSs allow one to define intra-\n\nparticle entanglement between momentum and spin degrees of freedom in a Galilean invariant manner. Second,\nthere are multiple, inequivalent two particle TPSs that\nare symmetry invariant. In particular, these TPSs can be\nused to define Galilean invariant entanglement between\nthe internal and external degrees of freedom of the two\nparticle system. Finally, this internal-external entanglement is also dynamically invariant, i.e., it is conserved\nduring any non-relativistic elastic scattering processes.\nSingle particle TPSs: The symmetry group of nonrelativistic space-time the Galilean group G in 3 + 1 dimensions. In quantum physics, what is relevant is (the\ncovering group of) G extended by the central charge of\nmass. Let us denote the elements of G by g = (b, a, v, R)\nwhere b \u2208 R is a time translation, a \u2208 R3 a space\ntranslation, v \u2208 R3 a velocity boost, and R \u2208 SO(3)\n(or u \u2208 SU(2) \u2192 R(u) \u2208 SO(3), the standard 2-to1 homomorphism) is a rotation. The associated generators for the unitary representations of G will be denoted by {\u0124, P\u0302, Q\u0302, \u0134}. They form a basis for the Galilei\nalgebra. The mass M\u0302 can be added as a central element of this operator Lie algebra. The mass-extended\nenveloping algebra includes the position operator X\u0302 =\nQ\u0302M\u0302 \u22121 , the orbital angular momentum vector operator L\u0302 = X\u0302 \u00d7 P\u0302, and the intrinsic spin vector operator\n\u015c = \u0134 \u2212 L\u0302. The operators corresponding to internal energy \u0174 = \u0124 \u2212 (2M\u0302 )\u22121 P\u03022 , intrinsic spin squared \u015c2 and\n(trivially) mass M\u0302 commute with the entire enveloping\nalgebra. They are proportional to the identity operator in the unitary irreducible representations (UIR) of\nG, M\u0302 = mI, \u0174 = W I, \u015c2 = s(s + 1)I, and these\neigenvalues characterize the representation Hilbert spaces\nH(m, W, s) [7, 8]. In the single particle case, it is possible\nto set W = 0 without loss of generality.\nThe UIR Hilbert space H(m, W, s) can be always realized as L2 -functions defined on the Cartesian product\nof the spectra of a complete system of commuting observables (CSCOs). A variety of such CSCOs exist and\nchoosing one is equivalent to constructing the UIR. A\n\n\f2\nstandard choice for a CSCO consists of the momentum\nvector P\u0302 and the spin component \u015c3 , along with the invariants M\u0302 , \u0174 and \u015c2 . The Hilbert space H(m, W, s) is\nthen realized as\nH(m, W, s) = Hp \u2297 Hs \u2192 L2 (R3 ) \u2297 C2s+1 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe choice of CSCO {P\u0302, \u015ci } induces the TPS (1) on the\nsingle particle state space, and based on this TPS one\ncan define intraparticle entanglement between momentum degrees of freedom and spin degrees of freedom.\nIn a general UIR, the action of U (g), g = (b, a, v, R) \u2208\nG, on a vector \u03c6\u03c7 (p) in H(m, W, s) is [8]\n1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(U (g)\u03c6)\u03c7 (p) = e\u2212i 2 ma*v+ia*p \u2212ibE\nX\n\u00d7\nDs (R((p, E), g\u0303))\u03c7\u2032 \u03c7 \u03c6\u03c7\u2032 (p\u2032 ) (2)\n\u03c7\u2032\n\nwhere p\u2032 = Rp + mv, E = 1/(2m)p2 + W , E \u2032 =\nE + v * p + 1/(2m)v2 , g\u0303 = (0, 0, v, R) and {R((p, E), g\u0303)}\nis an element of the \"little group\" of G for a massive particle. Recall that the little group is the largest subgroup\nthat leaves a standard momentum-energy pair (p0 , E0 )\ninvariant. For a massive particle, the little group of both\nthe Galilean and Poincar\u00e9 groups is isomorphic to the rotation group, and therefore, the Ds (R((p, E), g\u0303) is simply\nthe unitary 2s + 1 dimensional representation of the rotation group. By definition, the little group, and therewith also the representation (2), depend on the choice\nof (p0 , E0 ), which is arbitrary aside from the constraint\n1\nE \u2212 2m\np2 = W . However, it is known that all of these\ndifferent representations of G are equivalent [7, 8], and\ntherefore we may use any momentum-energy pair (p, E)\nto construct the general expression for the representation. The choice (0, W ) is particularly simple in that\n{R((0, W ), g\u0303)} = R, i.e., the little group of G can be\nchosen to be SU (2), independently of the momentum and\nenergy of the particle. With this choice, (2) reduces to\nthe simpler form\n\u2032\n\u2032 X\n1\nDs (R)\u03c7\u2032 \u03c7 \u03c6\u03c7\u2032 (p\u2032 ).\n(U (g)\u03c6)\u03c7 (p) = e\u2212i 2 ma*v+ia*p \u2212ibE\n\u03c7\u2032\n\n(3)\nThe following important property is evident in (3): the\nunitary operators U (g) factor into separate unitary operators U (g) = U (g)p \u2297 U (g)s acting on each Hilbert\nspace in (1). In other words, the unitary operators corresponding to Galilean transformations are local unitary\noperators with respect to the TPS (1). Thus, intraparticle entanglement between the spin and the momentum of\na free, non-relativistic particle is invariant across inertial\nreference frames. We note that this is very different from\nthe relativistic case, where the UIR does not factor and\nso momentum-spin entanglement is not invariant under\ncoordinate transformations even for free particles [5].\nWe call a TPS symmetry invariant if there exists a\nrepresentation U of some group G that factors with respect to this TPS, U (G) = U1 (G) \u2297 U2 (G) \u2297 * * * . It is\n\nnoteworthy that we do not require that each Ui (G) be a\nnontrivial UIR of the entire group G; the representation\nthat (3) furnishes in C2s+1 of (1) has the non-compact\npart of G trivially represented by the identity.\nFrom such a symmetry invariant CSCO one can generally construct new invariant TPSs. For instance, applying a unitary transformation of the form U = U1 \u2297 I2 to\nthe Hilbert space (1) one can get to a new Galilean invariant TPS corresponding to the transformed CSCO,\nU {P\u0302, \u015c3 }U \u22121 . As an example, Fourier transform the\nfirst factor to get the CSCO {X\u0302, \u015ci }: L2 (R3 ) \u2297 C2s+1 \u2192\nL2 (R3 )\u2297C2s+1 . Or, transform from rectangular to spherical coordinates to get the \u0001CSCO {P\u0302 , \u0398\u0302, \u03a6\u0302}: L2 (R3 ) \u2297\nC2s+1 \u2192 L2 (R+ ) \u2297 L2 (S2 ) \u2297 C2s+1 . Finally, choose a\nCSCO like {\u0124, L\u0302, L\u0302i }, thereby exploiting harmonic analysis to reduce functions the two-sphere S2 to an infinite\nseries with the spherical\nharmonics as basis\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\bL functions:\n2l+1\n\u2297\nL2 (R+ ) \u2297 L2 (S2 ) \u2297C2s+1 \u2192 L2 (R+ ) \u2297\nlC\nC2s+1 . In the TPSs for all of these CSCOs, the part of\nthe UIR that acts on the intrinsic spin Hilbert space can\nbe separated from the part that acts on the rest.\nThere are, of course, many non-invariant TPS structures of H(m, W, s). For example, the TPS induced\n2 \u02c6\nby\nJi } can be written as L2 (R+ ) \u2297\nnLthe CSCO {\u0124, \u0134 \u0001,o\n2j+1\n\u2297 Cd(j,s) , where d(j, s) is a degeneracy\nj C\nparameter that describes the number of times total angular momentum j appears in the coupling of l and s.\nThis TPS is not invariant because the UIR in each subspace depends on variables in the other. In general, how\na particular TPS transforms under a symmetry group\nis known when the group representation is well defined\nwith respect to that TPS. Given an entanglement measure defined in terms of the states, it is therefore possible to compute the change of entanglement due to the\ntransformation of states under this symmetry group. In\nparticular, it is possible to compute the time evolution\nof entanglement for a TPS that does not conserve it by\nusing these techniques.\nTwo free particle TPSs: The total Hilbert space for\nthe two particle states is the tensor product\nH = HA \u2297 HB ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere HN = H(mN , WN , sN ), N = A, B. The representation of G on H factors into a direct product of\nUIRs. With respect to the CSCO {P\u0302A , \u015ciA , P\u0302B , \u015ciB }, the\nunitary non-irreducible representation U (G) = UA (G) \u2297\nUB (G) is given by\nU (g)\u03c6(pA , pB )\u03c7A ,\u03c7B\n\n(5)\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212i 21 mB a*v+ia*p\u2032B \u2212ibEB\n\u2212i 21 mA a*v+ia*p\u2032A \u2212ibEA\n\ne\n=e\nX\nsA\ns\nB\n\u00d7\nD (R)\u03c7\u2032A \u03c7A D (R)\u03c7\u2032B \u03c7B \u03c6(p\u2032A , p\u2032B )\u03c7\u2032A ,\u03c7\u2032B .\n\u03c7\u2032A \u03c7\u2032B\n\nNote that while the factorization of the representation\n(5) with respect to the TPS (4) implies that interparticle entanglement is invariant under Galilean relativity, it\n\n\f3\ndoes not imply that the vectors \u03c6(pA , pB )\u03c7A ,\u03c7B are not\nentangled.\nThat the TPS HA \u2297 HB is an invariant TPS has nothing to do with the structure of G; rather, it is a general\nproperty that holds for any TPS constructed by the direct product of UIR spaces for any group. In contrast,\nthe invariance of the single non-relativistic particle TPS\n(1) is a specific property of the Galilean group. Using\n(1), we find that any partition of the four factors in\nH = HpA \u2297HsA \u2297HpB \u2297HsB leads to a Galilean invariant\nTPS. There are many possibilities, but in particular the\nbi-partite partition H = (HpA \u2297 HpB ) \u2297 (HsA \u2297 HsB )\nhas clear physical relevance: the entanglement between\nall the momentum degrees of freedom and all the spin\ndegrees of freedom is a Galilean invariant [9].\nOther symmetry invariant TPSs exist for the two particle case. For simplicity, consider spinless particles. The\nchange of variables to total and relative momentum\nP = pA + pB ,\n\nq=\n\n1\n(mB pA \u2212 mA pB ) (6)\nmA + mB\n\nis equivalent to the unitary transformation\nHpA \u2297 HpB \u2192 Hp \u2297 Hq\nL2 (R3 ) \u2297 L2 (R3 ) \u2192 L2 (R3 ) \u2297 L2 (R3 ).\n\n1\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nwhere P\u2032 = Rp + M v, q = Rq\u2032 , E = 1/(2M )P2 + W ,\nE \u2032 = E + v *P+ 1/2M v2 and W = WA + WB + 1/(2\u03bc)q2 .\nThe only term that depends on q is E \u2032 and it factors from\nthe rest. Therefore, (8) acts as local unitaries on the TPS\nHp \u2297 Hq (7). This shows that the entanglement between\nthe P and q degrees of freedom, which we refer to as the\ninternal-external (IE) entanglement, is Galilean invariant\nwith respect to the TPS (7). When solving the bound\nstate problem, one typically assumes that there is no IE\nentanglement and so the wave function for the net motion can be factored out from the internal wave function.\nAs understood in the context of the hydrogen atom [10],\nhaving zero internal-external entanglement certainly does\nnot imply that there is no interparticle entanglement, i.e.,\nentanglement with respect to the TPS (4). We will discuss this further in the next section.\nThe transformation of variables (6) and of TPS (7) is\nthe first step in finding the Clebsch-Gordan series for the\nreduction of the direct product of UIRs of G to a direct\nsum [8] (partial wave analysis). One way of writing this\ndirect sum reduction (including spin) is\nH(mA , WA , sA ) \u2297 H(mB , WB , sB )\n(9)\nZ \u221e\n\u221e\nM\nH(M, W, j) \u2297 Cd(j,sA ,sB ) .\ndW\n=\nW =WA +WB\n\nj=jmin\n\nH(mA , WA , sA ) \u2297 H(mB , WB , sB ) = HP \u2297 Hint\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the internal Hilbert space is\nHint = HW \u2297\n\n\u221e\nM\n\nH(M, W, j) \u2297 Cd(j,sA ,sB )\n\n(11)\n\nj=jmin\n\nThe unitary representation of G on (10) factors U = UP \u2297\nUint , where\n1\n\nApplying (6) to the state \u03c6(pA , pB ) of (5) and using the\nnotation M = mA + mB and \u03bc = mA mB /M , we find\nU (g)\u03c6\u0303(P, q) = e\u2212i 2 Ma*v+ia*P \u2212ibE \u03c6\u0303(P\u2032 , q\u2032 ),\n\nThere is no sum over mass in the Galilean case, but there\nis a sum over internal (or center-of-mass) energy W and\nintrinsic (or total center-of-mass) angular momentum j,\nwhere jmin = 0 if both particles are either fermions or\nbosons and jmin = 1/2 otherwise. Since Galilean group\nis not simply reducible, the same UIR space H(M, W, j)\nappears a number of times, d(j, sA , sB ). It is the number\nof ways orbital angular momentum l combines with total\nspin s to form total angular momentum j. The total spin\nin turn comes from the coupling of sA and sB .\nFor particles with spin, the IE TPS (7) generalizes as\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nUP (g)\u03c8e (P) = e\u2212i( 2 Ma*v+ia*P \u2212ibEe (P) \u03c8e (P\u2032 ),(12)\nX\nDj (R)ji\u2032 ji \u03c8i (W )jls ji\u2032 ,\nUint (g)\u03c8i (W )jls ji = e\u2212ibW\nji\n\nand Ee\u2032 (P) = 1/(2M )P2 + v * P + 1/2M v2 .\nDynamical invariance of IE entanglement in scattering: We can further extend this result to show that the\nsymmetry invariant TPS (10) is also dynamically invariant. Partial wave analysis (9) allows the use of Shur's\nlemma which asserts that an operator in the commutant\nof a representation is proportional to the identity in every UIR (sub)space. For instance, since the S-operator\nfor elastic scattering is Galilean invariant and unitary,\nShur's lemma implies that it acts as the unit operator on\neach H(M, W, j) in (9) and as a unitary, symmetric matrix, called the reduced S-matrix, in each Cd(j,sA ,sB ) [11].\nIn the case of a central interaction and spin-orbit coupling, the reduced S-matrix is just exp(2i\u03b4(W )l,s )\u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4ss\u2032 ,\nwhere \u03b4(W )l,s are called scattering phase shifts. Clearly,\nany Galilean invariant S-matrix factors into local unitaries on the IE TPS (10). Therefore, the amount of IE\nentanglement in an in-state will be invariant under any\nscattering dynamics that respects Galilean symmetry.\nWhile the amount of IE entanglement for this system\nunder the IE TPS (7) or (10) depends on the shape parameters of the input states (see below), it will not be\nchanged by any Galilean invariant dynamics, including\nall central and non-central, spherically symmetric interactions that depend on relative coordinates. The effect\nof such interactions V\u0302 is to change the internal energy of\nthe particle system, \u0174 = \u01740 + V\u0302 , where the subscript\n0 refers to the free particle system. Since internal energy is an invariant in the Galilean algebra, it is possible\nto define the interacting Hamiltonian \u0124 = \u01240 + V\u0302 by\n\n\f4\n1\nway of the relation \u0174 = \u0124 \u2212 2M\u0302\nP\u03022 . This amounts to\nchoosing the momentum, angular momentum and boost\noperators for the interacting system to be the same as\nthose for the free system. If the interaction is spherically\nsymmetric and depends only on the internal variables,\nthen these new interacting generators will fulfill the commutation relations of the Galilei group, and the analysis\nfor the symmetry invariant TPSs can now be carried out\nverbatim for the interacting case. That is, dynamical\ninvariance is a consequence of symmetry invariance. A\nsimilar analysis, with some complications, holds for the\nPoincar\u00e9 group. Here, the interactions can be included\ninto the invariant mass operator, the relativistic analog\nof internal energy. However, due to the structure of the\nPoincar\u00e9 algebra, it is not possible to simply modify the\nHamiltonian alone. Different choices of operators that\ninclude interactions lead to different forms of dynamics,\nbut the connection between the symmetry invariance and\ndynamical invariance holds in each case.\nConclusion: When considering entanglement in scattering, one generally looks at the interparticle entanglement associated with the TPS (4). One assumes that\nthere is no interparticle entanglement in the asymptotic\nin-state, where the interaction vanishes. The interparticle entanglement after the particles emerge from the interaction region can be calculated, for example, using the\npurity or entropy of the reduced density matrix, where\nthe Hilbert space of one particle has been traced over. As\nan example, consider the scattering of spinless particles\nwith Gaussian momentum wavefunctions [12, 13]:\n\n\u03c6in (pA , pB ) = NA e\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\u03c32\nA\n\n(pA \u2212pA0 )2\n\nNB e\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\u03c32\nB\n\n(pB \u2212pB0 )2\n\n.\n(13)\nThis in-state has no entanglement under the TPS (4).\nHowever, if we make the variable transformation (6),\nthe state \u03c6\u0303in (P, q) will have entanglement with respect\nto the IE TPS unless the masses and widths satisfy\nmA\nB\n= m\nGenerally, scattering dynamics transforms\n2\n2 .\n\u03c3A\n\u03c3B\nthe state (13) into an out-state with interparticle entanglement. However, [12] shows that in scattering with\na hard-core potential there is no interparticle entanglement in the out-state when exactly the same relationship\nbetween the masses and widths is satisfied. Also, it is\nproved in [13] that the wavefunction of a collection of\nparticles with different masses will converge to one with\nthe same mass-width relationship after scattering multiple times, and in this limit, interparticle entanglement\ntends to zero. These results appear to be consequences\nof the more general principle of dynamical invariance of\nIE entanglement.\nIn summary, there exist TPSs that are symmetry invariant, and therefore also dynamically invariant for a\nlarge class of potentials. These TPSs allow for measures\nof entanglement that do not depend on the frame of reference. They further motivate interesting questions about\nentanglement in particle scattering, such as the explicit\n\nchange of entanglement as a function of time in the TPS\n(4) and the dependence of this change on the details of\nthe interaction.\nN.L.H. acknowledges the U.S.-Italian Fullbright Commission and the University of Trento for supporting this\nwork during a sabbatical leave from American University and the Research Corporation for additional support.\nS.W. acknowledges an internal grant from Grinnell College and support from the University of Valladolid where\nhe was a visitor while this work was done.\n\n[1] H.
