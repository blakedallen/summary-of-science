The Galois group GalK(s) fs (X) of the polynomial fs (X)\nover K(s) is isomorphic to the cyclic group C4 of order four.\nIn the case where K = Q, for a \u2208 Z \\ {0, \u00b13} the polynomials fa (X) are irreducible over\nQ with GalQ fa (X) \u223c\n= C4 and the splitting fields SplQ fa (X) of fa (X) over Q are totally real\ncyclic quartic number fields which are called the simplest quartic fields (cf. e.g. [Gra77],\n[Laz91], [LP95], [Gaa02, Section 6.2], [Kim04], [HH05], [Duq07], [Lou07]).\nFor b = \u2212a \u2208 K, the polynomials fa (X) and fb (X) have the same splitting field\nover K.

One of the advantages of using multi-resolvent polynomials is the validity\nfor non-abelian groups (see [HM07], [HM09b], [HM09c], [HM]).\nTheorem 1.1. Let K be a field of char K 6= 2 and fa (X) = X 4 \u2212aX 3 \u22126X 2 +aX+1 \u2208 K[X]\nfor a \u2208 K. For a, b \u2208 K with a 6= \u00b1b and (a2 + 16)(b2 + 16) 6= 0, the following three\nconditions are equivalent :\n(i) the splitting fields of fa (X) and of fb (X) over K coincide ;\n(ii) the polynomial fA (X) splits completely into four linear factors over K for A = A1 or\nA = A2 where\nab + 16\nab \u2212 16\nA1 =\nand A2 =\n;\n\u2212a + b\na+b\n(iii) there exists z \u2208 K such that\nB = a+\n\n(a2 + 16)z(z + 1)(z \u2212 1)\nfa (z)\n\nwhere B = b or B = \u2212b.\nMoreover if GalK fa (X) \u223c\n= C4 (resp. GalK fa (X) \u223c\n= C2 or {1}) then (ii) occurs for only\none of A1 and A2 (resp. for both of A1 and A2 ) and (iii) occurs for only one of b and \u2212b\n(resp. for both of b and \u2212b).\nNote that the equivalence of the conditions (i) and (iii) is valid also for a = \u00b1b.\nBy Theorem 1.1, for a fixed a \u2208 K with a2 + 16 6= 0, we have SplK fb (X) = SplK fa (X)\nwhere b is given as in Theorem 1.1 (iii) for arbitrary z \u2208 K with fa (z) 6= 0 and b2 + 16 6= 0.\nHence we have the following:\nCorollary 1.2. Let K be an infinite field of char K 6= 2. For a fixed a \u2208 K with a2 +16 6= 0,\nthere exist infinitely many b \u2208 K such that SplK fb (X) = SplK fa (X).\nThe following theorem is well-known as Siegel's theorem for curves of genus zero (cf.\n[Lan78, Theorem 6.1], [Lan83, Chapter 8, Section 5]).\nTheorem (Siegel). Let K be a number field and OK the ring of integers in K. If a\nrational function \u03c6(s) \u2208 K(s) has at least three distinct poles, then there are only finitely\nmany z \u2208 K such that \u03c6(z) \u2208 OK .\nIn contrast with Corollary 1.2, by applying Siegel's theorem to Theorem 1.1, we get:\nCorollary 1.3. Let K be a number field and OK the ring of integers in K. Assume that\na \u2208 OK with a2 + 16 6= 0. Then there exist only finitely many integers b \u2208 OK such that\nSplK fb (X) = SplK fa (X). In particular, there exist only finitely many integers b \u2208 OK such\nthat fAi (X), (i = 1, 2), has a linear factor over Q where Ai is given in Theorem 1.1 (ii).\nWe treat the case of K = Q and a = m \u2208 Z. We get an application of Theorem 1.1 to\na related family of quartic Thue equations as follows.\nConsider the parametric family of quartic Thue equations\nFm (X, Y ) := X 4 \u2212 mX 3 Y \u2212 6X 2 Y 2 + mXY 3 + Y 4 = c\n2\n\n\ffor m, c \u2208 Z with c 6= 0. Note that fm (X) = Fm (X, 1). The equation Fm (X, Y ) = c has\nthe following solutions\nFm (0, \u00b1e) = Fm (\u00b1e, 0) = e4 ,\n\nFm (\u2213e, \u00b1e) = Fm (\u00b1e, \u00b1e) = \u22124e4 .\n\nWe call such solutions (x, y) to Fm (x, y) = c with xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) = 0 the trivial solutions.\nFor c \u2208 {\u00b11, \u00b14}, Lettl-Peth\u00f6 [LP95] and Chen-Voutier [CV97] gave a complete solution\nto Thue equation Fm (X, Y ) = c independently (cf. Section 4).\nIn [LPV99], Lettl-Peth\u00f6-Voutier showed that for m \u2265 58, the only primitive solutions\n(x, y) \u2208 Z2 , i.e. gcd(x, y) = 1, to the Thue inequality\n|Fm (x, y)| \u2264 6m + 7\nwith |x| \u2264 y are trivial solutions (0, 1), (\u00b11, 1) and (\u00b11, 2). Note that Fm (\u00b11, 2) = \u00b16m\u22127.\nWakabayashi [Wak07] investigated Thue inequalities |Fl,m (x, y)| \u2264 k with two parameters\nl, m and F1,m = Fm .\nFor m \u2208 Z, we put\nLm := SplQ fm (X).\nWe give the following correspondence between integer solutions to Fm (X, Y ) = c and isomorphism classes of the simplest quartic fields Lm .\nTheorem 1.4. Let m \u2208 Z \\ {0, \u00b13} and Lm = SplQ fm (X). There exists an integer\nn \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} such that Ln = Lm if and only if there exists non-trivial solution (x, y) \u2208 Z2 ,\ni.e. xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) 6= 0, to the quartic Thue equation\n(\u2217)\n\nFm (x, y) = c\n\nwhere c is a divisor of 4(m2 + 16). Moreover integers m, n and solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2 to (\u2217)\ncan be chosen to satisfy the equation\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\nN =m+\n\n(m2 + 16)xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y)\nFm (x, y)\n\nwhere either N = n or N = \u2212n, and the equation (\u2217\u2217) occurs for only one of N = n and\nN = \u2212n.\n\nThe assumption m 6= 0, \u00b13 ensures that fm (X) is irreducible over Q, GalQ fm (X) \u223c\n= C4\nand the equality (\u2217\u2217) holds for only one of N = n and N = \u2212n. This phenomenon\ncomes from the group theoretical reason (see Section 2). Indeed, in the case of m = \u00b13,\nf\u00b13 (X) = (X 2 \u00b1 X \u2212 1)(X 2 \u2213 4X \u2212 1) and the equation (\u2217\u2217) occurs for both of N = 3\nand N = \u22123. Thus non-trivial solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2 to (\u2217) which satisfy (\u2217\u2217) for N = \u2212m\nexist (cf. Theorem 1.1). Hence the assumption m 6= 0, \u00b13 also ensures that a non-trivial\nsolution (x, y) to (\u2217) corresponds N \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} via (\u2217\u2217).\nIf there exists an integer n \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} such that Ln = Lm , then we may choose a\nprimitive solution (x, y) \u2208 Z2 to (\u2217) with (x, y) \u2261 (1, 0) (mod 2). Then four solutions\n\u00b1(x, y), \u00b1(y, \u2212x) to (\u2217) for c = d and four solutions \u00b1(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ), \u00b1(y \u2032 , \u2212x\u2032 ) to (\u2217) for c = \u22124d\nare primitive, where (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = (x \u2212 y, x + y) and d is an odd divisor of m2 + 16, and only\nthese eight primitive solutions satisfy (\u2217\u2217) for the same N as in Theorem 1.4.\n\n3\n\n\fCorollary 1.5. For m \u2208 Z \\ {0, \u00b13}, let N be the number of primitive solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2\nwith xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) 6= 0 to Fm (x, y) = c where c is a divisor of 4(m2 + 16). Then we have\nn\n# n \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m}\n\no N\nLn = Lm , n > 0 =\n8\n\nwhere Lm = SplQ fm (X). In particular, if there does not exist n \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} with Ln = Lm\nthen Fm (x, y) = c where c is a divisor of 4(m2 + 16) has only trivial solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2\nwith xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) = 0.\nHowever we do not know non-trivial solutions to (\u2217) with m \u2265 0 except for m = 1, 2,\n3, 4, 22, 103, 956. By Theorem 1.1, we can check that L1 = L103 , L2 = L22 , L4 = L956 .\nSome numerical examples will be given in Sections 6, 7 and 8.\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nIn order to prove Theorem 1.1, we recall known results of the resolvent polynomials which\nare fundamental tools in the computational aspects of Galois theory (cf. [Coh93], [Coh00],\n[Ade01]). We intend to explain how to get an answer to the field intersection problem of\nfs (X) = X 4 \u2212 sX 3 \u2212 6X 2 + sX + 1, i.e. for a, b \u2208 K how to determine the intersection\nof SplK fa (X) and SplK fb (X). An answer to the field isomorphism problem (Theorem 1.1)\nmay be obtained as the special case of the field intersection problem.\nQm\nLet K be a fixed algebraic closure of a field K. Let f (X) := i=1 (X \u2212 \u03b1i ) \u2208 K[X] be\na separable polynomial of degree m with some fixed order of the roots \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m \u2208 K. By\nresolvent polynomials with suitable invariants, we may determine the Galois group of the\npolynomial f (X) over K as follows.\nLet R := K[x1 , . . . , xm ] be the polynomial ring over K with m variables x1 , . . . , xm .\nFor \u0398 \u2208 R, we take a surjective homomorphism \u03c9f : R \u2192 k(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m ), \u0398(x1 , . . . , xm ) 7\u2192\n\u0398(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m ), which is called the specialization map. The kernel of \u03c9f is the ideal If :=\n{\u0398 \u2208 R | \u0398(\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1m ) = 0} in R.\nLet Sm be the symmetric group of degree m. We extend the action of Sm on m letters\n{1, . . . , m} to that on R by \u03c0(\u0398(x1 , . . . , xm )) := \u0398(x\u03c0(1) , . . . , x\u03c0(m) ). We define the Galois\ngroup of f (X) over K by Gal(f /K) := {\u03c0 \u2208 Sm | \u03c0(If ) \u2286 If }. Then the Galois group of\nthe splitting field SplK f (X) of f (X) over K is isomorphic to Gal(f /K). If we take another\nordering of roots \u03b1\u03c0(1) , . . . , \u03b1\u03c0(m) of f (X) for some \u03c0 \u2208 Sm , the corresponding realization of\nGal(f /K) is conjugate in Sm . Hence, for arbitrary ordering of the roots of f (X), Gal(f /K)\nis determined up to conjugacy in Sm .\nFor H \u2264 U \u2264 Sm , an element \u0398 \u2208 R is called a U -primitive H-invariant if H = StabU (\u0398)\n:= {\u03c0 \u2208 U | \u03c0(\u0398) = \u0398}. For a U -primitive H-invariant \u0398, the polynomial\nY\n(X \u2212 \u03c0(\u0398)) \u2208 RU [X]\nRP \u0398,U (X) =\n\u03c0\u2208U/H\n\nwhere \u03c0 runs through the left cosets of H in U , is called the formal U -relative H-invariant\nresolvent by \u0398. The polynomial\nRP \u0398,U,f (X) := \u03c9f (RP \u0398,U (X))\nis called the U -relative H-invariant resolvent of f by \u0398. The following theorem is fundamental in the theory of resolvent polynomials (see e.g. [Ade01, p.95]).\n4\n\n\fTheorem 2.1. Let G = Gal(f /K), H \u2264 U \u2264 Sm be finite groups with G \u2264 U and \u0398 a U Ql\nprimitive H-invariant. Suppose that RP \u0398,U,f (X) = i=1 hei i (X) gives the decomposition\nof RP \u0398,U,f (X) into a product of powers of distinct irreducible polynomials hi (X), (i =\n1, . . . , l), in K[X]. Then we have a bijection\nG\\U/H\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nG\u03c0H\n\n7\u2212\u2192\n\n{he11 (X), . . . , hel l (X)}\nY\n\u0001\nh\u03c0 (X) =\nX \u2212 \u03c9f (\u03c4 (\u0398))\n\u03c4 H\u2286G \u03c0 H\n\nwhere the product runs through the left cosets \u03c4 H of H in U contained in G \u03c0 H, that\nis, through \u03c4 = \u03c0\u03c3 \u03c0 where \u03c0\u03c3 runs a system of representative of the left cosets of G \u2229\n\u03c0H\u03c0 \u22121 ; each h\u03c0 (X) is irreducible or a power of an irreducible polynomial with deg(h\u03c0 (X))\n= |G \u03c0 H|/|H| = |G|/|G \u2229 \u03c0H\u03c0 \u22121 |.\nCorollary 2.2. If G \u2264 \u03c0H\u03c0 \u22121 for some \u03c0 \u2208 U then RP \u0398,U,f (X) has a linear factor over\nK. Conversely, if RP \u0398,U,f (X) has a non-repeated linear factor over K then there exists\n\u03c0 \u2208 U such that G \u2264 \u03c0H\u03c0 \u22121 .\nNote that when RP \u0398,U,f (X) is not squarefree, there exists a suitable Tschirnhausen\ntransformation f\u02c6 of f over K such that RP \u0398,U,f\u02c6(X) is squarefree (cf. [Gir83], [Coh93, Alg.\n6.3.4]).\nWe apply Theorem 2.1 to the cyclic quartic case. Let f 1 (X) \u2208 K[X] and f 2 (X) \u2208 K[X]\nbe separable quartic polynomials over K respectively.\nWe put\nf (X) := f 1 (X)f 2 (X)\nand\nG1 := Gal(f 1 /K),\n\nG2 := Gal(f 2 /K),\n\nG := Gal(f /K).\n\nWe assume that G1 , G2 \u2264 C4 and apply Theorem 2.1 to m = 8, f (X) = f 1 (X)f 2 (X),\nU = h\u03c3i \u00d7 h\u03c4 i, H = h\u03c3\u03c4 i or h\u03c3\u03c4 3 i where \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 S8 act on R = K[x1 , . . . , x8 ] by\n\u03c3 : x1 7\u2192 x2 7\u2192 x3 7\u2192 x4 7\u2192 x1 ,\n\u03c4 : x5 7\u2192 x6 7\u2192 x7 7\u2192 x8 7\u2192 x5 .\n\nWe put U := h\u03c3i \u00d7 h\u03c4 i. Let \u03981 (resp. \u03982 ) be a U -primitive h\u03c3\u03c4 i-invariant (resp. h\u03c3\u03c4 3 iinvariant). Then we have the U -relative h\u03c3\u03c4 i-invariant (resp. h\u03c3\u03c4 3 i-invariant) resolvent\npolynomial of f (X) = f 1 (X)f 2 (X) by \u03981 (resp. \u03982 ) as\nRif (X) := RP \u0398i ,U,f (X),\n\n(i = 1, 2).\n\nThis kind of resolvent polynomial is also called (absolute) multi-resolvent polynomial (cf.\n[RV99], [Ren04]).\nFor a squarefree polynomial R(X) \u2208 K[X] of degree l, we define the decomposition type\nDT(R) of R(X) by the partition of l induced by the degrees of the irreducible factors of\nR(X) over K. By Theorem 2.1, we get the intersection field SplK f 1 (X) \u2229 SplK f 2 (X) via\nthe decomposition types DT(R1f ) and DT(R2f ).\n\n5\n\n\fTheorem 2.3. For f (X) = f 1 (X)f 2 (X) \u2208 K[X] with G1 , G2 \u2264 C4 , we assume that\n#G1 \u2265 #G2 and both R1f (X) and R2f (X) are squarefree. Then the Galois group G =\nGal(f /K) and the intersection field SplK f 1 (X)\u2229SplK f 2 (X) are given by the decomposition\ntypes DT(R1f ) and DT(R2f ) as on Table 1.\nTable 1\nG1\n\nG2\nC4\n\nC4\n\nC4\nC2\n{1}\nC2\n{1}\n\nG\nC4 \u00d7 C4\nC4 \u00d7 C2\n\nC2\n{1}\n{1}\n\nC4 \u00d7 C2\nC4\nC4\nC2 \u00d7 C2\nC2\nC2\n{1}\n\nL1 \u2229 L2 = K\n[L1 \u2229 L2 : K] = 2\nL1 = L2\nL1 \u2229 L2 = K\nL1 \u2283 L2\nL1 \u2283 L2 = K\nL1 \u2229 L2 = K\nL1 = L2\nL1 \u2283 L2\nL1 = L2 = K\n\nDT(R1f )\n4\n2, 2\n2, 2\n1, 1, 1, 1\n4\n4\n4\n2, 2\n1, 1, 1, 1\n2, 2\n1, 1, 1, 1\n\nDT(R2f )\n4\n2, 2\n1, 1, 1, 1\n2, 2\n4\n4\n4\n2, 2\n1, 1, 1, 1\n2, 2\n1, 1, 1, 1\n\nWe checked the decomposition types DT(Rif ), (i = 1, 2), on Table 1 by GAP [GAP].\nNow we get an answer to the field isomorphism problem of\nfs (X) = X 4 \u2212 sX 3 \u2212 6X 2 + sX + 1\nvia multi-resolvent polynomials Rifa,b (X) := RP \u0398i ,h\u03c3i\u00d7h\u03c4 i,fa,b , (i = 1, 2), where\nfa,b (X) := fa (X)fb (X)\nas the special case of Theorem 2.3. Note that disc(fs (X)) = 4(s2 + 16)3 .\nTheorem 2.4. For a, b \u2208 K with (a2 + 16)(b2 + 16) 6= 0, we assume that both R1fa,b (X) and\nR2fa,b (X) are squarefree. Then two splitting fields of fa (X) and of fb (X) over K coincide\nif and only if R1fa,b (X) or R2fa,b (X) splits completely into four linear factors over K.\nThis is an analogue of the classical result by Kummer theory. Namely for a field K which\ncontains a primitive fourth root of unity and a, b \u2208 K, the splitting fields of X 4 \u2212 a and of\nX 4 \u2212 b over K coincide if and only if X 4 \u2212 ab or X 4 \u2212 ab3 has a linear factor (equivalent to\nsplit completely) over K. It is remarkable that Theorem 2.4 does not need the assumption\nthat K contains a primitive fourth root of unity.\n\n3\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1\n\nWe give an explicit answer to the field intersection problem of the simplest quartic polynomials fs (X) via suitable invariants \u03981 and \u03982 . As the special case, we obtain Theorem\n1.1.\n\n6\n\n\fLet K(z) be the rational function field over K and \u03c3 a K-automorphism of K(z) of\norder four which is defined by\n\u03c3 : z 7\u2192\n\nz\u22121\n1\nz+1\n7\u2192 \u2212 7\u2192 \u2212\n7\u2192 z.\nz+1\nz\nz\u22121\n\nWe consider the fixed field K(z)h\u03c3i and the C4 -extension K(z)/K(z)h\u03c3i.

It follows that K(z)h\u03c3i =\nK(s) and the Galois group of the polynomial fs (X) over K(s) is isomorphic to C4 .\nWe also take another rational function field K(w) over K with indeterminate w, \u03c4 \u2208\nAutK K(w) with\n\u03c4 : w 7\u2192\n\n1\nw+1\nw\u22121\n7\u2192 \u2212\n7\u2192 \u2212\n7\u2192 w\nw+1\nw\nw\u22121\n\nand ft (X) = X 4 \u2212 tX 3 \u2212 6X 2 + tX + 1 where\nt=\n\n(w2 + 2w \u2212 1)(w2 \u2212 2w \u2212 1)\nw4 \u2212 6w2 + 1\n=\nw(w2 \u2212 1)\nw(w + 1)(w \u2212 1)\n\nby the same manner of K(z), \u03c3 and fs (X).\nPut U := h\u03c3i\u00d7 h\u03c4 i. Then the field K(z, w) is (C4 \u00d7 C4 )-extension of K(z, w)U = K(s, t).\nIn order to apply Theorem 2.4, we should find suitable U -primitive h\u03c3\u03c4 i-invariant \u03981\nand U -primitive h\u03c3\u03c4 3 i-invariant \u03982 .\nWe may find the following two U -primitive h\u03c3\u03c4 i-invariants which are candidates to \u03981 :\n\u03981 =\n\u03981 =\n\n3\nX\ni=0\n3\nY\n\n(\u03c3\u03c4 )i (zw) =\n\n(w + z)(wz \u2212 1)(zw \u2212 w \u2212 z \u2212 1)(zw + w + z \u2212 1)\n,\nzw(z 2 \u2212 1)(w2 \u2212 1)\n\nor\n\n(\u03c3\u03c4 )i (z + w)\n\ni=0\n2\n\n=\n\n(z w2 \u2212 zw2 \u2212 z 2 w + 2zw + w + z + 1)(z 2 w2 + zw2 + z 2 w + 2zw \u2212 w \u2212 z + 1)\n.\nzw(z 2 \u2212 1)(w2 \u2212 1)\n\nHowever the multi-resolvent polynomial R1fa,b (X) = RP \u03981 ,U,fa,b (X) where fa,b (X) =\nfa (X)fb (X) becomes complicated in the both cases above.\nExample 3.1. We present two explicit examples of the multi-resolvent polynomials Rifa,b (X)\n:= RP \u0398i ,h\u03c3i\u00d7h\u03c4 i,fa,b (X) for i = 1, 2 where fa,b (X) := fa (X)fb (X).\n7\n\n\f(i) In [HM09b], we gave an answer to the field isomorphism problem of fs (X) by taking\n\u03981 =\n\n2(z 2 + 1)(w2 + 1)(zw + 1)(z \u2212 w)\n,\nzw(z 2 \u2212 1)(w2 \u2212 1)\n\n\u03982 =\n\n2(z 2 + 1)(w2 + 1)(zw \u2212 1)(z + w)\n.\nzw(z 2 \u2212 1)(w2 \u2212 1)\n\nThen the corresponding multi-resolvent polynomials are given as\nR1fa,b (X) = X 4 \u2212 (a2 + 16)(b2 + 16)(X 2 \u2212 4(a \u2212 b)2 ),\n\nR2fa,b (X) = X 4 \u2212 (a2 + 16)(b2 + 16)(X 2 \u2212 4(a + b)2 ).\n\n(ii) If we take another U -primitive h\u03c3\u03c4 i-invariant \u03981 and h\u03c3\u03c4 3 i-invariant \u03982 as\n\u03981 =\n\n2(zw + 1)(z \u2212 w)\n,\n(z 2 + 1)(w2 + 1)\n\n\u03982 =\n\n2(zw \u2212 1)(z + w)\n(z 2 + 1)(w2 + 1)\n\nthen we get\nR1fa,b (X) = X 4 \u2212 X 2 +\n\n4(a \u2212 b)2\n,\n(a2 + 16)(b2 + 16)\n\nR2fa,b (X) = X 4 \u2212 X 2 +\n\n4(a + b)2\n.\n(a2 + 16)(b2 + 16)\n\nThe multi-resolvent polynomials in Example 3.1 are useful since they are biquadratic,\ni.e. quadratic polynomial with respect to X 2 . However we do not understand for a fixed\na \u2208 K whether there exist infinitely many b \u2208 K such that Rifa,b (X), (i = 1, 2), splits\ncompletely over K or not. By Theorem 2.4, this question means that for a fixed a \u2208 K\nwhether there exist infinitely many b \u2208 K such that SplK fa (X) = SplK fb (X).\nIt follows from [AHK98, Theorem 1.4] that there exist h\u03c3\u03c4 i-invariant \u03981 and h\u03c3\u03c4 3 iinvariant \u03982 such that K(z, w) = K(z, \u03981) = K(z, \u03982 ). The following gives such invariants\n\u03981 and \u03982 which is the key lemma of this paper.\nLemma 3.2. Let U = h\u03c3i \u00d7 h\u03c4 i.

Then the intersection\nfield SplK fa (X) \u2229 SplK fb (X) is given by the decomposition types DT(R1fa,b ) and DT(R2fa,b )\nas on Table 1 in Theorem 2.3.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. As the special case of Theorem 3.3, we see the conditions (i) and (ii)\nare equivalent (cf. also Theorem 2.4).\nThe condition (iii) is just a restatement of (ii). Indeed, we may check that z \u2208 K is\na root of fA1 (X) (resp. fA2 (X)) if and only if z satisfies the condition (iii) for B = b\n1\nz+1\n(resp. B = \u2212b). Note that if z is a root of fAi (X) then z\u22121\nz+1 , \u2212 z , \u2212 z\u22121 are also roots of\nfAi (X) for i = 1, 2. By Table 1 as in Theorem 2.3, if SplK fa (X) \u223c\n= C4 (resp. C2 or {1})\nand fAi (z) splits completely then fAj (X) is irreducible (resp. splits completely) over K for\n(i, j) = (1, 2) and (2, 1). This completes the proof.\n\n4\n\nSimplest quartic fields and related Thue equations\n\nIn this section, we treat the case of K = Q and a = m \u2208 Z for\nfa (X) = fm (X) = X 4 \u2212 mX 3 \u2212 6X 2 + mX + 1 \u2208 Z[X].\nWe first see\nLemma 4.1.

It follows from GalQ(s) fs (X) \u223c\n= C4 that GalQ fm (X) \u223c\n= C4 , C2 or {1} for m \u2208 Z.\nThus if fm (X) is reducible over Q then there exist a, b, c \u2208 Z such that fm (X) = (X 2 +\naX + c)(X 2 + bX + c) with c = \u221a\n\u00b11. By\u221acomparing the coefficients, we see c = \u22121, because\nif c = 1 then (m, a, b) = (0, \u00b12 2, \u22132 2). Also by comparing the coefficients, if c = \u22121\nthen (m, a) = (\u2212b + 4/b, \u22124/b) \u2208 Z2 . Hence b \u2208 {\u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b14}.

For c \u2208 {\u00b11, \u00b14} and m \u2265 0, all solutions\nto Fm (X, Y ) = c are given by eight trivial solutions\nFm (0, \u00b11) = Fm (\u00b11, 0) = 1,\n\nFm (\u22131, \u00b11) = Fm (\u00b11, \u00b11) = \u22124\n\nfor arbitrary m \u2265 0 and additionally\nF1 (\u22132, \u00b11) = F1 (\u00b11, \u00b12) = \u22121,\n\nF1 (\u00b13, \u00b11) = F1 (\u22131, \u00b13) = 4,\n\nF4 (\u22133, \u00b12) = F4 (\u00b12, \u00b13) = 1,\n\nF4 (\u00b15, \u00b11) = F4 (\u22131, \u00b15) = \u22124.\n\nWe put\n(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) := (x \u2212 y, x + y).\n\nThen if (x, y) \u2208 Z2 is a solution to Fm (x, y) = c then (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2208 Z2 is a solution to\nFm (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = \u22124c. Conversely if (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) is a solution to Fm (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = \u22124c then x\u2032 \u2261 y \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212x\u2032 +y \u2032\n) \u2208 Z2 is a solution to Fm (x, y) = c.\n(mod 2) and (x, y) = ( x +y\n2 ,\n2\nIn [LPV99], Lettl-Peth\u00f6-Voutier showed that for m \u2265 58, the only primitive solutions\n(x, y) \u2208 Z2 , i.e. gcd(x, y) = 1, to the Thue inequality\n|Fm (x, y)| \u2264 6m + 7\nare trivial solutions \u00b1(0, 1), \u00b1(1, 0), \u00b1(1, 1), \u00b1(\u22121, 1) and non-trivial solutions \u00b1(2, 1),\n\u00b1(\u22121, 2), \u00b1(\u22122, 1), \u00b1(1, 2). We note that Fm (\u00b12, 1) = Fm (\u22131, 2) = \u22136m \u2212 7.\nIf (x, y) \u2208 Z2 is a primitive solution to (\u2217) then four pairs \u00b1(x, y), \u00b1(y, \u2212x) are primitive\nsolutions to (\u2217). We also see the following lemma:\nLemma 4.2. Put (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) := (x \u2212 y, x + y). If (x, y) \u2208 Z2 with (x, y) \u2261 (0, 1) or (1, 0)\n(mod 2) is a primitive solution to Fm (x, y) = c then c is an odd integer and (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2261 (1, 1)\n(mod 2) is a primitive solution to Fm (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = \u22124c. Conversely if (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2208 Z2 with\n(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2261 (1, 1) (mod 2) is a primitive solution to Fm (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = d then d = \u22124c for an odd\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212x\u2032 +y \u2032\n) \u2261 (0, 1) or (1, 0) (mod 2) is a primitive solution to\ninteger c and (x, y) = ( x +y\n2 ,\n2\nFm (x, y) = c.\nProof. Assume that (x, y) \u2208 Z2 with (x, y) \u2261 (0, 1) or (1, 0) (mod 2) is a primitive solution\nto Fm (x, y) = c. Then c is odd because Fm (0, 1) = Fm (1, 0) = 1. It follows by the definition\nthat (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2261 (1, 1) (mod 2) and Fm (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = \u22124c. If gcd(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = k \u2032 > 1 then k \u2032 is odd\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand k \u2032 divides both x = x +y\nand y = \u2212x 2+y . This contradicts to gcd(x, y) = 1. Hence\n2\nwe have gcd(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = 1.\nConversely we assume that (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2208 Z2 with (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) \u2261 (1, 1) (mod 2) is a primitive\nsolution to Fm (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = d. Then Fm (1, 1) = \u22124 \u2261 0 (mod 4) and 6\u2261 0 (mod 8). Thus\n10\n\n\fd = \u22124c for an odd integer c \u2208 Z. We also see Fm (x, y) = c. If gcd(x, y) = k > 1 then k\ndivides both x\u2032 = x \u2212 y and y \u2032 = x + y. This contradicts to gcd(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = 1. Therefore we\nhave gcd(x, y) = 1. Because if (x, y) \u2261 (1, 1) (mod 2) then Fm (x, y) \u2261 0 (mod 4), we also\nobtain (x, y) \u2261 (0, 1) or (1, 0) (mod 2).\n\n5\n\nProof of Theorem 1.4: the correspondence\n\nThe aim of this section is to establish the correspondence between isomorphism classes of\nthe simplest quartic fields Lm and non-trivial solutions to quartic Thue equations (\u2217) as\nfollows:\nTheorem (Theorem 1.4). Let m \u2208 Z \\ {0, \u00b13} and Lm = SplQ fm (X). Then there exists\nan integer n \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} such that Lm = Ln if and only if there exists non-trivial solution\n(x, y) \u2208 Z2 , i.e. xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) 6= 0, to the quartic Thue equation\nFm (x, y) = x4 \u2212 mx3 y \u2212 6x2 y 2 + mxy 3 + y 4 = c\n\n(\u2217)\n\nwhere c is a divisor of 4(m2 + 16). Moreover integers m, n and solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2 to (\u2217)\ncan be chosen to satisfy the equation\n(\u2217\u2217)\n\nN =m+\n\n(m2 + 16)xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y)\nFm (x, y)\n\nwhere either N = n or N = \u2212n, and the equation (\u2217\u2217) occurs for only one of N = n and\nN = \u2212n.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. We use Theorem 1.1 in the case where K = Q.\nFor m \u2208 Z \\ {0, \u00b13}, we assume that there exists an integer n \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} such that\nLm = Ln . By Theorem 1.1, there exists z \u2208 Q such that\nN = m+\n\n(m2 + 16)z(z + 1)(z \u2212 1)\nfm (z)\n\nwhere either N = n or N = \u2212n. Write z = x/y with x, y \u2208 Z and gcd(x, y) = 1 then we\nhave\n(m2 + 16)xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y)\nN = m+\n\u2208 Z.\nFm (x, y)\nBy the assumption n 6= \u00b1m, we have xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) 6= 0.\nWe will show that c := Fm (x, y) divides 4(m2 + 16). We make use of a resultant and the\nSylvester matrix (cf. [PV00], [SWP08, Section 1.3], see also [Lan78, Theorem 6.1], [Lan83,\nChapter 8, Section 5]).\nPut h(z) := (m2 + 16)z(z + 1)(z \u2212 1) and f (z) := Fm (z, 1). We take the resultant\nRm := Resz (h(z), f (z)) = 16(m2 + 16)4\n\n11\n\n\fof h(z) and f (z) with respect to z.

Hence it follows from\nTheorem 1.1 (i) and (iii) that N \u2208 Q \\ {\u00b1m} and Lm = LN .\nWe should show that N \u2208 Z. If x 6\u2261 y (mod 2) then c = Fm (x, y) divides m2 + 16 and\nhence N \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m}, because Fm (x, y) \u2261 Fm (x, y) \u2261 1 (mod 2).\nIf x \u2261 y (mod 2) then c = Fm (x, y) divides (m2 + 16)xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) and hence\nN \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m}, because xy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) \u2261 0 (mod 4).\nN = m+\n\n12\n\n\f6\n\nPrimitive solutions\n\nBy the proof of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.4, a non-trivial solution (x, y) \u2208 Z2 to (\u2217)\nmay be obtained as z = x/y with gcd(x, y) = 1 where z \u2208 Q is a root of fA (X) =\nX 4 \u2212 AX 3 \u2212 6X 2 + AX + 1 for A = A1 or A = A2 with\nA1 =\n\nmn + 16\nmn \u2212 16\nand A2 =\n\u2212m + n\nm+n\n\nas in Theorem 1.1 (ii). Hence we now consider only primitive solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2 , i.e.\ngcd(x, y) = 1, to (\u2217).\nLemma 6.1. Let m \u2208 Z \\ {0, \u00b13} and Lm = SplQ fm (X). We assume that there exists\nn \u2208 Z \\ {\u00b1m} such that Ln = Lm .\n(i) We may choose non-trivial primitive solution (x, y) \u2208 Z2 with (x, y) \u2261 (0, 1) (mod 2)\nto Fm (x, y) = d where d is an odd divisor of m2 + 16. Then four pairs \u00b1(x, y), \u00b1(y, \u2212x)\nare primitive solutions to Fm (X, Y ) = d and four pairs \u00b1(x\u2032 , y \u2032 ), \u00b1(y \u2032 , \u2212x\u2032 ) are primitive\nsolutions to Fm (X, Y ) = \u22124d where (x\u2032 , y \u2032 ) = (x \u2212 y, x + y).\n(ii) All primitive solutions to (\u2217) which satisfy (\u2217\u2217) for either N = n or N = \u2212n are given\nby the eight solutions as in (i), and such solutions exist for only one of N = n and N = \u2212n.\n\nProof. By Theorem 1.4, there exists non-trivial solution (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 Z2 to Fm (x0 , y0 ) = c for\na divisor c of 4(m2 + 16). By Lemma 4.2, we may choose (x, y) \u2208 Z2 with (x, y) \u2261 (0, 1) or\n\u2261 (1, 0) (mod 2) to Fm (x, y) = d where d is an odd divisor of m2 + 16. Again by Lemma\n4.2, eight pairs \u00b1(x, y), \u00b1(y, \u2212x) for d and \u00b1(x \u2212 y, x + y), \u00b1(x + y, \u2212x + y) for \u22124d are\nall primitive solutions. Hence we may assume that (x, y) \u2261 (0, 1) (mod 2).\nThese eight solutions correspond to the same N as in Theorem 1.4 because\nxy(x + y)(x \u2212 y)\nFm (x, y)\nis invariant under the actions of x 7\u2212\u2192 y 7\u2212\u2192 \u2212x and x 7\u2212\u2192 x \u2212 y, y 7\u2212\u2192 x + y.\nFor z = x/y, the equation (\u2217\u2217) holds if and only if fA (z) = 0 where\nA=\n\nmN + 16\n\u2212m + N\n\n(see the proof of Theorem 1.1).

In [HM09b, Example 5.4], however, we\nchecked with the aid of computer that for integers 0 \u2264 m < n \u2264 105 , Lm = Ln if and only\nif (m, n) \u2208 {(1, 103), (2, 22), (4, 956)}. Using Magma [BCP97], we can get the following:\n14\n\n\fTheorem 8.1. For 0 \u2264 m \u2264 1000, all non-trivial primitive solutions (x, y) \u2208 Z2 , i.e.\nxy(x + y)(x \u2212 y) 6= 0 and gcd(x, y) = 1, to (\u2217) are given on Table 2 and Table 3.
