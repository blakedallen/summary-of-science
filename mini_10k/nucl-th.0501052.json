The nuclei 12 Be, 15 B,\n23\nN and 27 F are of such nature, in particular 23 N with a half-life of 37.7 s and a halo radius of\n6.07 fm is an excellent example of Samba-halo configuration. The fusion below the barrier of the\nSamba halo nuclei with heavy targets could reveal the so far elusive enhancement and a dominance\nof one-neutron over two-neutron transfers, in contrast to what was found recently for the Borromean\nhalo nucleus 6 He + 238 U.\nPACS numbers: 25.70.Jj, 25.70.Mn, 24.10.Eq, 21.60.-n\n\nBorromean nuclei, be them halo or not, are quite common and their study has been intensive [1, 2, 3, 4]. These\nthree-body systems have the property that any one of\ntheir two-body subsystems is unbound. The halo-type\nBorromean nuclei are of special interest as they are unstable and their radii are quite large compared to neighboring stable nuclei. Typical cases are 11 Li [5] and 6 He [6].\nThe cores, c, 4 He and 9 Li are bound but the three twobody subsystems are not; 5 He and 10 Li and the nn system (n represents a neutron). Borromean excited states\nof stable nuclei also exist. A well known example is the\nHoyle resonance in 12 C at an excitation energy of about\n6.8 MeV. This resonance, of paramount importance in\nstellar nucleo-synthesis, is a cluster of three 4 He nuclei,\nwith the unbound 8 Be as two-body subsystems.\nAn important issue that has to be addressed is how the\nhalo Borromean nuclei are formed as more neutrons are\nadded to a given stable nucleus. In order to answer this\nquestion we have made a survey of the isotopes of several\nnuclei in the proton p-shell region as well as the fluorine\nisotopes. We have discovered that the halo develops in\nthe Borromean nuclei in a gradual fashion. Further, to\nreach the halo Borromean nucleus the system, two neutrons down, acquires a new configuration which in several\ncases is a halo-type as well. This new type of halo nuclei\nhas the feature that only one of its two-body subsystems,\nthe di-neutron, is unbound. The other two subsystems\nare weakly bound. Another feature of this configuration\nis that the one neutron separation energy, En , is smaller\nthan that of the two-neutron, E2n , in contrast to the\nBorromean halo nuclei where En > E2n . Of course the\nsituation En < E2n that prevails in the new \"doorway\"\nconfiguration is shared by the other normal isotopes. In\nwhat follows we shall use the available information about\nthe isotopes studied here contained in the Nuclear Wallet Cards (Sixth edition, 2000). Note that no Borromean\n\nisotope exists in oxygen (see, however, Ref. [1]).\nAs an example we consider the boron isotopes: A =\n8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 19. Both 17 B and 19 B\nwould be Borromean halo nuclei (19 B more so). The\nisotope 15 B is the doorway configuration. The halo radius is 5.15 fm while nuclear radius is 2.91 fm, to be\ncompared to 2.50 fm of normal A = 15 nucleus. The details of our radius calculation are given below. We have\nidentified five candidates for Samba halo nuclei [7, 8] of\nthe doorway type. They are 12 Be, 15 B, 20 C, 23 N and\n27\nF. The name Samba partly is inspired by the work of\nRobicheaux [9] who exploited yet another type of halo\nthree-body systems, such as the hypertriton 3\u039b H1 , where\nonly one of the two-body subsystems is tightly bound,\nand called such systems Tango halo systems. Whereas,\nthe Tango halo nucleus has a bound two-body subsystem that has to move in a rather \"harmonic\" fashion in\nthe presence of the core, the Samba nucleus (two of the\ntwo-body subsystems are tightly bound) is distinguished\nby the fact that the motion of the two-neutron subsystem can be a rather more \"agitated\" and the three-body\nsystem remains bound.\nWe have calculated the reduced dipole transition\nstrengths B(E1) and the radii of these five candidates for\nSamba halo nuclei. The B(E1)'s were calculated using\na simple cluster model usually employed to get a rough\nestimate [10]. This model treats the two neutrons as a\ncluster that vibrates against the core. A Yukawa type\nwave function is used to describe the ground state and\na plane wave is employed for the final continuum state\nin the calculation of the dipole matrix element. The\nmodel allows for the derivation of a simple analytical formula for the dipole strength distribution, dB(E1)/dE \u2217 .\nThe dipole distribution is an important quantity in the\nstudy of exotic nuclei that is usually measured through\nthe electromagnetic dissociation of these fragile systems\n\n\f2\n1.6\n\nin the field of a heavy target such as 208 Pb. Integrating\ndB(E1)/dE \u2217 over E \u2217 gives the B(E1) value. The cluster\nmodel gives a simple formula for this\n\u0012 \u00132\n2Z\n1\n3e2\n,\n(1)\nB(E1) =\n16\u03c0\u03bc A\nE2n\n\n2\n\n2\nhrn\u2212CM\ni estimated as \u03c1 mh\u0304n S3 (see Refs. [7] and [8]).\nThe quantity rho is adimensional. For our purposes \u03c1 is\n17\nobtained calculating the average (R(14\nqBe) + R( B))/2\n\nand associating this to squareroot\n\n2\nhrn\u2212CM\ni above.\n\nHere R(14 Be) = 3.74 fm and R(17 B) = 3.8 fm, from\nRef. [2], S3 is the three-body energy with respect to the\nbinding energy of the neutron in the two-body subsystem, S3 = E2n (A) \u2212 En (A \u2212 1) for Samba nuclei, where\nEn (A \u2212 1) is the neutron separation energy in the bound\nA \u2212 1 system, and S3 = E2n for Borromean nuclei. With\nthis value of \u03c1 we calculate all the radii shown in the table\nand figure. The full symbols (see Table I) are the radii\nof Samba type halo nuclei calculated exactly within the\nthree-body model described below and the open symbols\nare the radii of the Borromean halo nuclei calculated as\nabove with \u03c1 set equal 1.35. Both radii appear divided\nby the radii calculated assuming a normal nature of the\nisotopes, namely, R0 = 1.013A1/3 fm (the factor 1.013 fm\nwas taken to reproduce the experimental radius of 12 C of\nR= 2.32 fm [13]).\n\nR/R0\n\nwhere \u03bc is the reduced mass of the core and the 2n cluster. The factor 2Z/A corresponds to the number of neutrons in the halo, 2; the charge of the core, Z and the\nmass number of the whole halo nucleus, A. Note that\nthe two neutron separation energy is inversely proportional to the average distance between the q\ncore center\n2\ni,\nand the three-body center-of-mass (CM ),\nhrc\u2212CM\nwhich is used as the healing distance of the cluster model\nwave function. For, e.g., 12 Be we find for B(E1) the\nvalue 0.043 e2 fm2 (another calculation gives 0.05-0.06\ne2 fm2 [11]) to be compared with 0.051(13) e2 fm2 for the\nexperimental value [12] and to 0.61 e2 fm2 for the well\ndeveloped halo in the Borromean nucleus 6 He. Thus one\nshould be able to get reasonably reliable and appreciable dissociation cross section for this Samba nucleus (the\nyield or production cross section of these nuclei should\nbe larger than those of the Borromean halo nuclei [14],\nrendering the experiment quite feasible). It is worth mentioning here that for Tango halo nuclei, where the halo is\na pair of proton-neutron, the B(E1) is similar to Eq. (1)\nexcept for the energy E2n , which is replaced by Epn and\nthe factor (2Z/A)2 which is replaced by [(A \u2212 2Z)/A]2 .\nThis will render the B(E1) for Tango halo nuclei a factor [(A \u2212 2Z)/2Z]2 smaller than that of a corresponding\nSamba or Borromean nucleus if E2n is maintained equal\nto Epn .\nIn figure (1) we show the halo radii of our candidates\nfor two-neutron halo nuclei as a function of the isospin\nprojection Tz = (N \u2212 Z)/2. These radii can be estimated\nfrom the neutron-CM\nq root mean square radius\nq\n\n1.4\n\ncircles - Be\nsquares - B\ntriangles - C\ndiamond - N\nstars - F\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nTZ\nFIG. 1: Halo radii of our candidates for two-neutron halo\nnuclei in isotopes indicated in the legend. The full symbols\nare the Samba type nuclei (results from Table I) and the open\nsymbols are the Borromean nuclei. All the points are divided\nby the the isotope radii, R0 , calculated assuming a normal\nnature of the isotope. Tz is the isospin projection.\n\nConspicuous in the figure is lack of indication of oneneutron halo nuclei whose radii are quite large and deviant from R0 . These nuclei, such as 11 Be, 19 C and others\nhave been shown to have a well developed one-neutron\nhalo. We did not show these halo nuclei as the thrust\nof our work here is on three-body, two-neutron halo nuclei. Also absent in the figure is the, what would be,\nBorromean halo nucleus following the Samba one, 23 N.\nWe are tempted to predict that such a nucleus, 25 N, may\nexist, though we have no information about En , E2n and\nits life time. From the above considerations and we can\nclearly rule out 20 C as a Samba halo nucleus and accordingly 22 C as a Borromean halo nucleus.\nThe \"doorway\" aspect of the Samba halo nuclei is quite\nevident especially in the circles, squares and stars. They\nalways precedes the final Borromean halo nucleus in the\nchain of isotopes. It would be indeed very interesting to\nperform Coulomb dissociation experiment on, e.g. 23 N,\nand 27 F to investigate the dipole strength distribution\nand also the longitudinal momentum distribution to assess the halo nature of these Samba systems. The nucleus\n12\nBe has a rather subtle shell model structure with the\nground state containing (1s1/2 )2 , (1p1/2 )2 and possibly\n(1d5/2 )2 configurations, making it less likely to be a clear\ncut Samba type halo nucleus.\nIn Table I we have collected several physical quantities\nof the following Samba type nuclei (treated as a n \u2212 n \u2212 c\nthree-body system): 12 Be, 15 B, 20 C, 23 N and 27 F.

The second and third columns are, respectively, the n\u2212c and the n\u2212n\u2212c energies\np 2 used to calculate\nthe n \u2212 CM root mean-square radii,\nhrn\u2212CM i. R0 is the\nnucleus radius and Rcore is\nthe\ncore\nradius,\nR (eq. (2)) is the\np 2\nhrn\u2212CM i. B(E1,0 \u2192 1) is given\naverage between R0 and\nby eq. (1). T1/2 is the nucleus half-life.\n\nThe calculated radii of the Samba nuclei in the threebody model are a bit larger than the measured one (e.g.\nfor 12 Be, Rexp = 2.59 \u00b1 0.06 fm see Ref. [15]). We trace\nthis small discrepancy to the neglect of Pauli blocking\neffect which tends to make the nuclear potential between\nthe core and the neutrons less attractive at short distances. In order to not change the three-body binding\nenergy the system needs to shrink a little to better feel\nthe nuclear attraction.\nThe radii in Table I were calculated using the threebody formalism of Refs. [7, 16]. In these references,\nsubtracted Faddeev equations for the three-body system\nn \u2212 n \u2212 c are used. The subtraction energy which is required in the model is taken to be \u03bc2(3) (E = \u2212\u03bc2(3) is\nan arbitrary subtraction point where the T -matrix (from\nthis point a small t will be used when we refer to the twobody t-matrix and a capital one when we refer to the\nthree-body T -matrix), T (\u2212\u03bc2(3) ), should be known. A\nmore detailed description about our subtraction method\ncan be found in Refs. [17]). The motivation behind the\nsubtraction is the use in the model of a delta function potential for the nn interaction which yields divergent twobody t-matrix at large momenta (short distances). Thus\nthe Faddeev equations for the three-body system must be\nappropriately subtracted. The n \u2212 c interaction is also\n\ntaken to be of a zero range. Therefore, in this model the\nonly physical scales used as input are directly related to\nobservables: the nn scattering length, the energies En\nand E2n . It is worth mentioning that the subtracted\nthree-body equations are obtained through an elimination procedure that involves the renormalization of the\ndelta function interaction strength so that the large momentum divergence alluded to above is removed. In a nut\nshell, one takes the two-body matrix t(E) for the delta\ninteraction, \u03bb\u03b4(~r \u2212~r \u2032 ), at an energy, \u2212\u03bc2(2) , and identify it\nwith the renormalized coupling strength \u03bbR (\u2212\u03bc2(2) ). The\ndelta potential t-matrix at any energy can be obtained\nthrough usual Lippmann-Schwinger manipulations as\ntR (E)\u22121 = \u03bbR (\u2212\u03bc2(2) )\u22121 + 2\u03c0 2 (\u03bc(2) + ik).\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the index R will refer to a renormalized t- or T matrix.\nThe three-body T -matrix can be handled in a similar\nfashion with the above subtracted two-body matrix. The\nsubtracted three-body T -matrix can be written as\nTR (E) =\n\nTR (\u2212\u03bc2(3) ) + TR (\u2212\u03bc2(3) ) [G0 (E)\ni\n\u2212G0 (\u2212\u03bc2(3) ) TR (E).\n\n(4)\n\nIt is a simple matter to show that TR above is\nindependent on the value of the subtraction energy\n\u2212\u03bc2(3) , namely dT (E)/d\u03bc2(3) = 0. This is clear by\nconstruction. Formally, this independence of T (E)\non \u03bc(3) can be shown by resorting to the identity,\ndT (E)/d(E) = \u2212T (E)G20 (E)T (E), which is clearly also\nvalid for dT (\u2212\u03bc2(3) )/d\u03bc2(3) . Thus we have, using Eq. (4),\ndTR (E)\ndTR (E)\n= 2\u03bc(3)\n= 0.\n2\nd\u03bc(3)\nd\u03bc(3)\n\n(5)\n\nThe second relation in the above formula is a CallanSymanzik type, commonly used in renormalization procedure of field theories.\nArmed with the above invariance of TR (E) with regards to the subtraction energy and the removal of the\nultraviolet divergence of the delta potential two-body tmatrix, the three-body T -matrix can be used to construct\nthe corresponding wave function needed to calculate matrix elements among which is the root mean-square radius of a given nucleus [7]. The mean-square distances\n2\n2\n(hrn\u2212CM\ni and hrc\u2212CM\ni) and the coupled subtracted integral equations for the Faddeev spectator components\nare obtained from expressions given in Refs. [7, 8].\nBefore ending, we should mention what is expected of\nthe Samba halo nuclei when they are used to induce reactions on heavy targets. In particular, at very low energies\n(in the vicinity of the Coulomb barrier) we expect that\nthe Samba halo nucleus to fuse with, say, 208 Pb, with a\nprobability which is not so much affected by the breakup\ncoupling, and may exhibit a halo enhancement, contrary\nto what was found in the 6 He+238 U studied in Ref. [18].\n\n\f4\nIn further contrast to 6 He, the Samba nucleus would exhibit a one-neutron transfer process competing with the\ntwo-neutron one. The one-neutron transfer cross section\ncould be larger than the two-neutron one, depending on\nthe extension of the corresponding configuration in the\nSamba halo nuclei. A specific Samba nucleus that we\nsuggest to investigate experimentally is 23 N which has a\nlife time of 37.7 s and a halo radius of 6.07 fm. The enhancement of the fusion, sought for in vain in Borromean\n\nnuclei [18, 19], may come into light with the Samba nuclei.\n\n[1] A.S. Jensen, K. Riisager, D.V. Fedorov and E. Garrido,\nRev. Mod.
