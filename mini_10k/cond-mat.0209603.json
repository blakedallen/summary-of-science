The ideal width of these peaks\n(aside from problems of experimental resolution) is due\nboth to relative thermal atomic motion and to static disorder. Thus, an investigation of the effects of lattice vibrations on PDF peak widths is important for at least\ntwo reasons: first, to establish the degree to which information on phonons (and the interatomic potential) can\nbe obtained from powder diffraction data, and, second,\nto account for correlation effects in order to properly extract information on static disorder in a disordered system such as an alloy.\nIn general, powder diffraction is not considered a favorable approach for extracting information about phonons\nsince, not only is energy information lost in the measurement, but also the diffuse scattering is isotropically\naveraged. The lattice vibrations are best described from\nthe phonon dispersion curves determined using inelastic neutron scattering and high-energy-resolution inelas-\n\ntic x-ray scattering on single crystals.4,5 Nevertheless,\nwith the advent of high-energy synchrotron x-ray and\npulsed-neutron sources and fast computers, it is possible\nto measure data with unprecedented statistics and accuracy. The PDF approach has been shown to yield limited\ninformation about lattice vibrations in powders,6 though\nthe extent of which this information can be extracted\nremains controversial.7,8,9,10\n\nMeasuring powders has the benefit that the experiments are straightforward and do not require single crystals. It is thus of great interest to characterize the degree\nto which lattice vibrations are reflected in the PDF using\nsimple models, such as the Debye model, in situations\nwhere detailed interatomic potential information is not\navailable. In this paper we explore these issues by comparing both measured PDFs and those calculated from\nrealistic potential models with PDFs obtained through a\nsingle-parameter Debye model. This comparison is carried out as a function of atomic pair separation, temperature and direction in the lattice. We find that a single\nparameter Debye model explains much of the observed\nlattice vibrational effects on PDF peak widths, including\nthe temperature dependence, in crystals like Ni, Ce, and\nGaAs. However, small but non-negligible deviations from\nthe Debye model calculation are evident in crystal which\nneeds a long-range interaction to explain anomalies in\nthe dispersion curves.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nRigid\u2212Body Thermal Motion\n\nCORRELATED ATOMIC MOTION IN\nREAL-SPACE\n\nG(r)\n\n(a)\n\nThe existence of interatomic forces in crystals results\nin the motion of atoms being correlated. This is usually treated theoretically by transforming the problem to\nnormal coordinates, resulting in normal modes (phonons)\nthat are non-interacting, thus making the problem mathematically tractible. Projecting the phonons back into\nreal-space coordinates yields a picture of the dynamic\ncorrelations. This situation can be understood intuitively\nin the following way. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of atomic motion in three different interatomic\nforce systems, each with its corresponding ideal PDF\nspectrum. In a rigid-body system, Fig. 1(a), the interatomic force is extremely strong and all atoms move in\nphase. In this case, the peaks in the PDF are deltafunctions. At the opposite extreme the atoms are noninteracting (the Einstein model) and move independently\nas shown in Fig. 1(b). This type of atomic motion results\nin broad PDF peaks whose widths are given\np by the root\nmean-square displacement amplitude ( hu2 i). In real\nmaterials, the interatomic forces depend on atomic pair\ndistances, i. e., they are strong for nearest-neighbor interactions and get weaker as the atomic pair distances\nincrease. In fact, these interactions are often quite well\ndescribed with just nearest-neighbor or first- and secondnearest-neighbor coupling. The case of nearest-neighbor\ninteractions is shown in Fig. 1(c). In this (Debye) model\na single parameter corresponding to the spring constant\nof the nearest-neighbor interaction is used. Here, nearneighbor atoms tend to move in phase with each other,\nwhile far-neighbors move more independently. As a result, the near-neighbor PDF peaks are sharper than those\nof far-neighbor pairs. This behavior was first analyzed by\nKaplow et al. in a series of papers11,12,13 for a number\nof elemental metals.\n\nIII.\n\nEXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS\n\nThe experimental PDFs discussed here were measured\nusing pulsed neutrons and synchrotron x-ray radiation.\nThe neutron measurements were carried out at the NPD\ndiffractometer at the Manual Lujan, jr., Neutron Scattering Center (LANSCE) at Los Alamos and the x-ray\nexperiments at beam line A2 at CHESS (Cornell). Powder samples of Ni and a polycrystalline Ce rod were\nloaded into a vanadium can for the neutron measurements, carried out at room temperature. Powdered GaAs\nwas placed between thin foils of kapton tapes for the xray measurements, measured at 10 K using 60 KeV (\u03bb\n= 0.206 \u00c5) x-rays. Due to the higher x-ray energy at\nCHESS and relatively low absorption coefficient of GaAs,\nsymmetric transmission geometry was used.\nBoth the neutron and x-ray data were corrected14,15 for\nexperimental effects and normalized to obtain the total\nscattering function S(Q), using programs PDFgetN16 and\n\nr\nUncorrelated Atomic Motion\nG(r)\n\n(b)\n\nr\nCorrelated Atomic Motion\n\u03b1\n\nG(r)\n\n(c)\n\nr\nFIG. 1: Schematic diagram showing an instantaneous snapshot of atomic positions in (a) rigid-body model (b) Einstein\nmodel (c) Debye model. In (a) and (b) all PDF peaks have\nthe same width independent of atom separation. In (c) the\nPDF peak width increases up to the root mean-square displacement as the atomic separation increases. \u03b1 is a spring\nconstant.\n\nPDFgetX,17 respectively. The experimental PDF, G(r),\nwas obtained by taking the Fourier transform of S(Q):\nRQ\nG(r) = \u03c02 0 max Q[S(Q) \u2212 1]sinQr dQ, where Qmax is the\nmaximum momentum transfer. The experimental PDF\npeak widths as a function of pair distance are extracted\nusing the 'real-space' Rietveld program PDFFIT.18 For\ndetailed procedures about modelling PDF spectrum and\nextracting PDF peak widths refer to Ref. 6.\nIV. MEAN-SQUARE RELATIVE\nDISPLACEMENTS IN CRYSTALS\n\nThe PDF peak of simple materials can be well approximated by a Gaussian function with a width \u03c3ij .19,20 The\nmean-square relative displacement of atom pairs, projected onto the vector joining the atom pairs, is given\nby\n2\n\u03c3ij\n= h[(ui \u2212 uj ) * r\u0302ij ]2 i,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ui , uj are thermal displacements of atoms i and j\nfrom their average positions.19,20 The vector r\u0302ij is a unit\nvector parallel to the vector connecting atoms i, j, and\nthe angular brackets indicate an ensemble average. This\nequation can be rearranged as\n2\n\u03c3ij\n= h[ui * r\u0302ij ]2 i + h[uj * r\u0302ij ]2 i \u2212 2h(ui * r\u0302ij )(uj * r\u0302ij )i.

Deviations\nfrom this line are due to motional correlations in the pair\n2\nmotion. The inset shows \u03c3ij\nbelow rij \u2264 20 \u00c5, where the\nmotional correlation is more apparent. Evidently, motion\nof near-neighbor atoms is highly correlated, and this is\nreflected in narrower PDF peak widths. At larger separa2\ntions (rij \u2265 20 \u00c5) the \u03c3ij\nvalues asymptotically approach\nthe uncorrelated values because the cosine term in Eq. 3\naverages to zero.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the motional correlation of atom\npairs varies significantly as a function of pair distance.\nTherefore it is useful to quantify the degree of correlation\nusing a dimensionless correlation parameter \u03c6 which can\n\n2\n\u03c3ij\n= \u03c3i2 + \u03c3j2 \u2212 2\u03c3i \u03c3j \u03c6,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c3i2 = h(ui * r\u0302ij )2 i. It can be seen from Eq. 4 that\n\u03c6 = 0 corresponds to completely uncorrelated motion.\nPositive values of \u03c6 describe a situation where the atoms\nmove in phase, and thus the resulting value of \u03c3ij is\nsmaller than for the uncorrelated case. Using Eq. 4 the\ncorrelation parameter \u03c6 can be calculated from the PDF\npeak width measurements as\n\u03c6=\n\n2\n(\u03c3i2 + \u03c3j2 ) \u2212 \u03c3ij\n.\n2\u03c3i \u03c3j\n\n(5)\n\nFigure 3 shows the motional correlations along various\ncrystallographic directions in Ce. It is clear that the\ncorrelation parameter varies significantly with crystallographic direction. Along the <110> direction, Ce atomic\nmotion shows strong correlation. On the other hand, Ce\natoms along <100> show almost no motional correlation.\nThis behavior comes principally from the characteristic\nelastic anisotropy of cubic crystals.25 Despite the extensive orientational averaging of the powder measurement,\nthis directional information survives in the data.\n2\nThe oscillations in \u03c3ij\nshown in Fig. 2 for Ce are generally driven by both the interatomic interactions and the\ncrystal structure. This is illustrated in Figs. 4 and 5,\nwhich show the correlation parameter \u03c6 for a variety of\n2\nFCC and BCC materials. The \u03c3ij\nin Figs. 4 and 5 are\ngenerated in the same way as for Ce, that is, using the\nBvK force model, with parameters derived from fits to\nthe phonon dispersion curves found in the literature.26\nOne sees that a common oscillatory behavior in the correlation parameter is found for all of the FCC crystals\nstudied. And similar but distinct oscillatory features are\nobserved for the BCC crystals, except Nb. This difference\nin the general behavior of FCC and BCC crystals suggests that atomic geometry plays a role in the motional\n\n\f4\n\n)\n\n(a) 1 NN\n\nij\n\nCe 8NN\n\n0.000\n\nAl 8NN\n\n0.006\n\nFrequency spectrum of\n\nCorrelation parameter:\n\nNi 4NN\n\n0.4\n\n0.002\n\n2\n\nCa 8NN\n\n0.004\n\n(\n\n0.006\n\n0.5\n\nAu 4NN\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n(b) 2 NN\n\n0.004\n0.002\n0.000\n0.006\n\n(c) 10 NN\n\n0.004\n0.002\n0.000\n0.006\n\n(d) Uncorrelated pair\n\n0.004\n0.002\n\n0.0\n\n0.000\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n0.0\n\nr(\u00c5)/a\n\n0.5\n\nFe 5NN\n\nCorrelation parameter:\n\nTa 7NN\nNa 5NN\n\n0.4\n\nNb 8NN\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n/2\n\nFIG. 4: Correlation parameter \u03c6 of FCC crystals Ca, Ni, Ce,\nAl, Au at 300 K, obtained using the BvK model calculations.\na is the lattice parameter of each crystal.\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nr(\u00c5)/a\n\nFIG. 5: Correlation parameter \u03c6 of BCC crystals Fe, Ta, Na,\nNb at 300 K, obtained using the BvK model calculations. a\nis the lattice parameter of each crystal.\n\ncorrelations as well as the interatomic interaction.

Figure 6 shows the\n2\nfrequency spectrum of \u03c3ij\nin Ce for the 1NN, 2NN and\n10NN peaks, in addition to that of the uncorrelated farneighbor atom pairs. Referring to Fig. 6, for the 1NN,\nthe low frequency (\u03c9/2\u03c0 \u2264 1 THz) thermal motion contributes little to the 1NN PDF peak width broadening.\nMost of the peak broadening comes from mid-to-high frequency modes (1 \u2264 \u03c9/2\u03c0 \u2264 3 THz), which contribute\nalmost equally to the broadening. This suggests that\n1NN pair moves more or less in-phase at low frequencies, and that the pair motion de-phases somewhat as the\nfrequency increases. For the 2NN and higher-neighbors\npeaks, however, where the motion of atom pairs gets\nmore and more de-phased as the pair distance increases,\nthe medium-range frequency modes predominantly contribute to peak width broadening. Finally, for the farneighbor atom pairs, where the motion is completely uncorrelated, the frequency spectrum is spread more evenly\nacross all of the frequencies.\n\nV.\n\nCORRELATED THERMAL MOTION:\nDEBYE APPROXIMATION\n\nUsing the BvK model we have shown that nearneighbor atomic motions in crystalline materials are\nstrongly correlated. In the BvK model calculation, however, the force constants must be known in advance.\nIn this section, we simplify the result in Eq. 3 using\nsome approximations to describe the effects of the lattice vibrations on the PDF peak widths without knowing the force constants. Following Debye27 and Beni and\nPlatzmann,28 we make no distinction between longitudi-\n\n\f5\n\nwhere h***i is the average over the 3N modes and N is the\nnumber of atoms. This result is a general expression for\nall materials and is independent of the number of atoms\nper unit cell.25 Using the Debye approximation, \u03c9 = ck,\nwe can write Eq. 6 as follows29 :\n\u0014\n\u0015\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u03c9D\n1\nsin(\u03c9rij /c)\n\u03c1(\u03c9)\n2~\n2\nn(\u03c9) +\n1\u2212\n,\nd\u03c9\n\u03c3ij =\n3N M 0\n\u03c9\n2\n\u03c9rij /c\n(7)\nwhere \u03c1(\u03c9) = 3N (3\u03c9 2 /\u03c9D 3 ) is the phonon density of\nstates, n(\u03c9) is the phonon occupation number, c is\nthe sound velocity and \u03c9D = ckD is the Debye cut-off\nfrequency. The Debye wavevector is given by kD =\n(6\u03c0 2 N/V )1/3 where N/V is the number density of the\ncrystal.

This result is known as the \"correlated\nDebye (CD) model\".28,29,30 Here, the first term corresponds to the usual uncorrelated mean-square thermal\ndisplacements (2hu2 i) and the second term is the displacement correlation function (DCF). The CD model\nwas first used to explain XAFS peak widths as a function of temperature, and provided reasonable fits to the\n1NN and 2NN peak widths. However, this model has\nnever been tested beyond the 2NN peak. Here we test\nthis simple model against full experimental PDF spectra\nand the BvK model calculations.\nIn the CD model the DCF shows explicit dependence\non the atomic pair distance rij . The first term of the\nDCF comes from the quantum zero-point motion and the\nsecond term is temperature dependent. Figure 7 shows\nthe rij dependence of the first and second terms of the\n2\nDCF of Ni. The first term of the DCF decreases as 1/rij\nwith a cosine modulation. The second term is temperature dependent and shows a 1/rij dependence. At low\ntemperatures (T\u226a \u03b8D ), the temperature dependent DCF\nterm is much smaller than the zero-point motion term.\nHowever, as the temperature increases the second term\nbecomes dominant. These results show that the motional\n2\ncorrelation follows a 1/rij\ndependence when T\u226a \u03b8D and\na 1/rij when T\u2265 \u03b8D .\nWe tested the CD model calculation against the experimental and BvK PDF peak widths of Ni at 300 K.\nFigure 8 shows selected experimental PDF peak widths\nand the calculated peak widths as a function of pair distance, as well as the corresponding phonon density of\n\n0.0008\n\n1st term of DCF\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\nDisplacement Correlation Function (\u00c5 )\n\nnal and transverse phonon modes and take a spherical\naverage.

The errors in the experimental PDF peak\nwidths were estimated from fitting Gaussian functions\nto the PDF peaks. The error in CD model calculation\nwas estimated from the error in the experimental thermal\ndisplacement. For the BvK model calculation, we used\nup to the 4th NN force parameters determined by Birgeneau et al..31 We also compared the 4NN BvK model\ncalculations with those of a simple 1NN BvK model and\nfound excellent agreement between them. Our experimental thermal displacement of Ni (hu2 i = 0.00535 \u00c52 )\nis about 10% larger than that of the BvK model calculation. As a result, as shown in Fig. 8(a), the BvK\nmodel peak widths are shifted downward by roughly 5 %\noverall. The origin of this difference between our thermal\ndisplacement and that of the BvK calculation is not clear\nbut the Debye temperature, determined from our thermal\ndisplacement using the Debye approximation, \u03b8D =385 K,\ncompares well to the specific heat measurement, where\n\u03b8D =375 K.32 For the CD model calculation the Debye\nwavevector kD =1.756 \u00c5\u22121 was obtained from the atomic\ngeometry. The only parameter in the CD model, the Debye temperature, was determined from the experimental\nthermal displacement.\nAs shown in Fig. 8(b), the Debye model reasonably\napproximates the 'real' density of states in this simple\nelement. However, because the Debye temperature and\ncorresponding Debye frequency were obtained from the\nthermal displacement, and not from the sound velocity,\nthe low-frequency Debye density of states deviates from\nthose of the BvK model by roughly 15%. Nevertheless,\nthe CD model calculation of the peak widths shows good\nagreement with the experimental PDF peak widths \u03c3ij\nexcept for the overall downward shift.\nWe now move to the more complex case of Ce, which\n\n\f6\n(\u00c5)\nij\n\n(a)\n0.10\n\n0.09\n\n0.08\nExperiment\nBvK model\n\n0.07\n\nDebye model\n\nPDF peak width:\n\nPDF peak width:\n\nij\n\n(\u00c5)\n\n0.11\n\n0.22\n\n(a)\n0.20\n\n0.18\n\n0.16\nExperiment\nBvK model\n\n0.14\n\nDebye model\n0.12\n\n0.06\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n5\n\n20\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nr(\u00c5)\n\nr(\u00c5)\n1.2\nBvK model\n\n) (arb. unit)\n\n(b)\n\nDebye model\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\ng(\n\ng(\n\n) (arb. unit)\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n(b)\n\nBvK model\nDebye model\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n/2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(THz)\n\nFIG. 8: (a) Comparison of neutron PDF and BvK model\npeak widths with those of the CD model calculation of Ni at\n300 K.

Up to the 8th NN interactions are required to reasonably fit the phonon dispersion curves of\nCe.22 Figure 9 shows selected experimental PDF peak\nwidths and calculated peak widths as a function of pair\ndistance, as well as the phonon density of states of Ce. In\nthis case, the BvK calculation of the peak widths shows a\ngood agreement with the experimental PDF peak widths.\nWe also found that a simple 1NN BvK model calculation\nshows very good overall agreement with that of 8NN BvK\nmodel, except for the 2NN PDF peak width which deviates by \u223c 3 %. For the CD model calculation, a Debye\nwavevector kD =1.1986 \u00c5\u22121 and a Debye temperature\n\u03b8D =117 K (at 300 K) were obtained from the atomic\ngeometry and thermal displacement of Ce (hu2 i=0.0231\n\u00c52 ), respectively. Even for the more complex system like\nCe, the CD model calculation of the PDF peak widths\nreproduces the overall rij -dependence rather well, except\nfor a few detailed features.\n2\nWe now consider the T -dependence of \u03c3ij\nfor specific\natom pairs of Ce. These are shown in Fig. 10 for the first\nfew NN pairs, as well as the uncorrelated atom pair.

Re2\nferring to Fig. 9 we see that BvK calculations of the \u03c3ij\nof the 1NN and 3NN lie very close to the Debye prediction, but the 2NN is displaced significantly upwards. The\ndeviations between the BvK and Debye models increase\n2\nas the temperature increases. Apparently, if the \u03c3ij\nlies\non the Debye prediction at one temperature, the Debye\nmodel will also predict its temperature dependence cor2\nrectly. Conversely, the temperature dependence of \u03c3ij\nwill be underestimated or overestimated depending on\nwhether it is displaced above or below the Debye curve\nat the lowest temperatures, respectively. This is at least\ntrue for Ce.\nAs a final example, we compare the CD model calculation of PDF peak widths with those of GaAs determined\nexperimentally. This is distinct from the above examples due to the presence both of more than one atomic\nspecies and directional covalent bonding. We also compare the CD model calculation with a lattice-dynamics\ncalculation using the Kirkwood potential, which has been\nshown to be a good basis for describing semiconductor\ncompounds and alloys.15,33 Figure 11(a) shows the atom\npair dependence of the PDF peak widths of GaAs at\n10 K. In the Kirkwood model, the potential parameters\nare obtained by fitting the nearest and far neighbor PDF\npeak widths.15,33 In Fig. 11(a), the Kirkwood model calculation using bond stretching (\u03b1=96 N/m) and bending (\u03b2=10 N/m) force constants shows quite good agree-\n\n\f(\u00c5)\n\n7\n0.065\n\n(a)\n\nij\n\n2\n\n0.04\n\n1NN\n\nPDF peak width:\n\n2\n2NN\n\n0.03\n\n0.01\n\n2\n\n(\u00c5 )\n\n0.02\n\n0.055\n\nExperiment\n\n0.050\n\nKirkwood model\nDebye model\n\n0.045\n\n0.00\n\n5\n\n2\nij\n\n0.060\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n2\n\n0.04\n\nr(\u00c5)\n\nDW\n2\n\n1.0\n\n5NN\n\n0.03\n\n) (arb. unit)\n\n2\n3NN\n\n0.02\n\ng(\n\n0.01\n\n0.00\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\nTemperature (K)\n2\nFIG. 10: Mean-square relative displacement \u03c3ij\nof Ce as\na function of temperature.

In the\nCD model, the average mass of Ga and As is used. The\nDebye wavevector kD = 1.382 \u00c5\u22121 and Debye temperature \u03b8D =250 K were obtained from the atomic geometry and by fitting the far-neighbor PDF peak widths.\nIn the CD model calculation, the near-neighbor peaks\n(r \u2264 5 \u00c5) are \u223c 10% broader than those of the experimental peaks. Referring to Fig. 11(b), the Debye\nmodel does a poor job of describing the GaAs phonon\ndensity of states; for example, the high frequency optic\nmodes, 6 \u2264 \u03c9/2\u03c0 \u22648 THz, are totally missed. Instead,\nthe Debye model over-estimates phonon modes between\n3.5 THz \u2264 \u03c9/2\u03c0 \u2264 \u03c9D . This poor description of the\nphonon density of states, as well as the use of the average\nmass of Ga and As for M in Eq. 7, leads to deviations in\nnear-neighbor peak widths from those of the experimental peaks and the BvK model calculations. Therefore,\nthe deviations in CD model calculations basically reflect\nthe limitation of the CD model in describing motional\ncorrelations in a system with optic modes. Nevertheless,\nthe CD model, with a single parameter \u03b8D determined\nfrom the thermal displacement, serves as a good first order approximation to the PDF peak widths, even in more\ncomplex systems like GaAs.\n.\nVI.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\n2\nThe mean-square relative displacements \u03c3ij\nand the\ncorresponding correlation parameter shown in Figs. 2, 4,\n\n(b)\n\n0.8\n\nLocal Density Approximation\nDebye model\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n/2\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(THz)\n\nFIG. 11: (a) PDF peak widths of GaAs as a function of\natom separation at 10 K.

First\nof all, they show that nearest-neighbor atomic motion is\nsignificantly correlated. Second, the details of the motional correlations as a function of pair distance display\nstructures which deviate from the predictions of the simple CD model. Here we can raise some interesting questions. How is this structure in the motional correlation\nof atom pairs related to the underlying interatomic potentials? Can one extract the potential parameters using\nan inverse approach to model the PDF peak widths with\nthe potential parameters as input?\nReichardt and Pintschovius8 argued that the calculated PDF peak widths as a function of pair distance\nare rather insensitive to the details of the lattice dynam2\nics models used to calculate \u03c3ij\n. They found that PDFs\ncalculated using either very simple or complex models\ndidn't show significant differences. A similar conclusion\nhas been reached by Graf et al.,10 in contradiction to previous claims by Dimitrov et al..7 Indeed, the magnitude\nof errors implicit in the measurement and data analysis appear to be comparable to the effects that must be\nmeasured to obtain quantitatively accurate potential information using this approach.9 The conclusions of Reichardt and Pintschovius and Graf et al. and Thorpe et\nal. are largely borne out by the present work; e.g., the\ngrossly oversimplified CD model, which neglects elastic\n\n\f8\nanisotropy and parameterizes the dynamics with a single\nnumber \u03b8D , is rather successful at explaining the smooth\nrij -dependence of the PDF peak widths.\nThus, when the BvK force parameters are not available, we have shown that the correlated Debye (CD)\nmodel is a reasonable approximation to describe both the\nsmooth rij -dependence and the temperature dependence\n2\nof \u03c3ij\nin simple elements. Considering the poor correspondence between the Debye phonon density of states\nand the BvK density of states, the reasonable agreement\n2\nbetween the BvK model calculations of \u03c3ij\nand that of\nthe CD model is rather surprising. This confirms that\nthe PDF peak width is rather insensitive to the details\nof the phonon density of states and the phonon dispersion curves, as suggested by Reichardt and Pintschovius\nand by Graf et al.. Any information about the interatomic forces in the PDF peak widths is contained in the\n2\nsmall deviations of the \u03c3ij\nfrom those of the CD model\ncalculations. Therefore, extracting interatomic potential\ninformation from the PDF peak widths is unlikely. However, these deviations could possibly yield some average\nphonon information. For example, recent calculations by\nGraf et al.10 show that one can obtain phonon moments\nwithin a few percent accuracy for most FCC and BCC\ncrystals using the nearest-neighbor force parameters extracted from a theoretical BvK PDF spectrum. This result indicates that the PDF spectrum contains some average phonon information, although it doesn't provide\ndetailed phonon dispersion information. The average\nphonon information, such as phonon moments from the\nPDF peak widths, will be a useful complement to optical\nand acoustic techniques that yield zone-center information in situations where single crystal measurements are\nnot possible. This complementarity also extends to the\nextraction of Debye-Waller factors from powder diffraction measurements.\nFinally, a comparison of the CD model calculations of\nthe PDF peak widths in GaAs with those of experimental\nPDF and Kirkwood model calculations shows additional\nlimitations of the CD model. In the CD model calculation, the near-neighbor PDF peaks below r \u2264 5 \u00c5 are\nabout 5-10% broader than those of experimental PDF\npeaks. This is due to the poor description of GaAs\nphonon density of states by the Debye model. Since\nthe sine term in Eq. 7 over- and under-weighs certain\nphonon modes depending on their frequencies, the redistribution of GaAs phonon density of states in a realistic model causes deviations in near-neighbor peak widths\nfrom those of the CD model. One way to improve the\nmodel calculation in materials which have optic modes\nmight be a hybrid model that combines the correlated\nDebye and Einstein models. Such a hybrid model has\nworked quite well in the case of AgI.34\nVII.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper the mean-square relative displacements\n2\n) of atomic pair motion in crystals have been stud(\u03c3ij\n\nied as a function of pair distance and temperature using\nthe atomic pair distribution function (PDF). The experimental PDF peak width and the BvK model calculations\n2\nof \u03c3ij\nas a function of pair distance show that the nearneighbor atomic motions are strongly correlated. The\nextent of these correlations depends both on the interatomic interactions and crystal structure. Thus, a proper\naccounting of the lattice vibrational effects on the PDF\npeak widths is important in order to better understand\nthe effects of static and dynamic disorder on the PDF\npeak widths in disordered systems. Details of the PDF\npeak widths vs. rij seen in the BvK calculations are\nwell reproduced in the measured data indicating the accuracy of the measurements. Most of these details originate from the elastic anisotropy of the crystal which is\nespecially apparent in FCC crystals. We showed that the\nCD model reproduces the average features of the lattice\nvibrational effects on the PDF peak width with just one\nparameter, which is determined from the measured thermal displacement hu2 i. Therefore, this simple model can\nbe used as an important adjunct when using PDF to extract static and dynamic disorder disorder information\nfrom materials with local lattice distortion. In addition,\nthe T-dependence of the CD model largely agrees with\nthe BvK model calculations. Good agreement between\nCD model and experimental PDF peak widths indicates\nthat the PDF peak widths are rather insensitive to the\ndetails of phonon density of states and the phonon dispersion curves. Any information about the interatomic\nforces in the PDF peak widths is contained in the small\ndeviations (\u2264 5%) of the \u03c3ij from those of the CD model\ncalculation. This makes the extraction of interatomic potential information from PDF peak widths alone unlikely.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nIKJ gratefully acknowledges Prof. M. F. Thorpe for\nmany helpful discussions.
