Baumgartner et al.\n\nInterest in contraction groups has been stimulated by applications in the theory\nof probability measures and random walks on, and the representation theory of,\nlocally compact groups. For these applications it is important to know whether a\ncontraction group is closed. We refer the reader to the introduction in [2] and the\nreferences cited there for information about the applications of contraction groups\nand known results. Recent articles which treat contraction groups are [8] and [7].\nThe article [2] studied the contraction group Ug and its supergroup\n\b\nPg := x \u2208 G : {gn (x) : n \u2208 N} is relatively compact\n\nin the case where the ambient group is locally compact and totally disconnected, a\ncase in which previously little was known. In contrast to Ug , the group Pg is always\nclosed if the ambient group G is totally disconnected [17, Proposition 3, parts (iii)\nand (ii)]. The group Pg was named the parabolic group of the automorphism\ng in [2] because for any inner automorphism of a semisimple algebraic group\nover a local field its parabolic group is the group of rational points of a rational\nparabolic subgroup (and every such group is of that form); the corresponding contraction group in that case is the group of rational points of the unipotent radical\nof the parabolic subgroup. In this algebraic group context, identifying parabolic\nsubgroups (in the dynamical sense, introduced above) and their unipotent radicals\nwith parabolic subgroups (in the algebraic group sense) and the corresponding\ncontraction groups is a crucial technique used by G. Prasad to prove strong approximation for semisimple groups in positive characteristic [11]. This technique\nwas later used again by G. Prasad to give a simple proof of Tits's theorem on\ncocompactness of open non-compact subgroups in simple algebraic groups over\nlocal fields [12], which can be proved also by appealing to Howe-Moore's property.\nIn this article we investigate which contraction groups of inner automorphisms\nin complete Kac-Moody groups are closed. Complete Kac-Moody groups (which\nwe introduce in Section 2) are combinatorial generalizations of semisimple algebraic groups over local fields. In contrast to members of the latter class of groups,\ncomplete Kac-Moody groups are generically non-linear, totally disconnected, locally compact groups. These properties make them perfect test cases for the developing structure theory of totally disconnected, locally compact groups which\nwas established in [17], and further advanced in [18] and [19].\nOur main result is the following theorem, in whose statement the contraction\ngroup of a group element g is understood to be the contraction group of the inner\nautomorphism g : x 7\u2192 gxg\u22121 .\nTheorem 1.1 (Main Theorem) Let G be an abstract Kac-Moody group over a\nfinite field and G be the closure of the image of G in the automorphism group of\nits positive building. Then the following are true:\n1. The contraction group of any topologically periodic element in G is trivial.\n2. If the type of G is irreducible and neither spherical nor affine, then the contraction group of any element that is not topologically periodic in G is not\nclosed.\nFurthermore, the group G contains non-topologically periodic elements whenever\nG is not of spherical type.\n\n\fContraction groups in complete Kac-Moody groups\n\n3\n\nThe second assertion of Theorem 1.1 is in sharp contrast with the known results about contraction groups of elements in spherical and affine Kac-Moody\ngroups. In particular, all contraction groups of inner automorphisms are closed for\nsemisimple algebraic groups over local fields; this follows from the representation\nof contraction groups as rational points of unipotent radicals and we direct the\nreader to part 2 of Proposition 6.3 for a slightly more general statement.\nConsequently, all contraction groups of inner automorphisms are closed for\ncertain affine Kac-Moody groups, namely those that are geometric completions of\nChevalley group schemes over the rings of Laurent polynomials over finite fields.\nFor completions of Kac-Moody groups of any spherical type the same is seen to\nbe true; see part 1 of Proposition 6.3.\nThus Theorem 1.1 and Proposition 6.3 provide another instance of the strong\ndichotomy between Euclidean and arbitrary non-Euclidean buildings with large\nautomorphism groups which is already evident in results such as the Simplicity Theorem in [5] and the strong Tits alternative for infinite irreducible Coxeter\ngroups by Margulis-Noskov-Vinberg [9,10].\nThe groups covered by the second part of our Main Theorem are topologically simple [15], indeed in many cases algebraically simple [4] groups, whose\nflat rank assumes all positive integral values [1], and indeed are the first known\ngroups who have non-closed contraction groups and whose flat rank can be larger\nthan 2; we refer the reader to [19,1] for the definition of flat rank. They are thus\n'larger' but similar to the group of type-preserving isometries of a regular, locally\nfinite tree, which is a simple, totally disconnected, locally compact group of flat\nrank 1, whose non-trivial contraction groups are non-closed. This follows from\nExample 3.13(2) in [2] and Remark 3.10.\nThe Main Theorem will be proved within the wider framework of groups with\na locally finite twin root datum. Within this wider framework we need to impose\nthe additional assumption that the root groups of the given root datum are contractive (a condition introduced in Subsection 4.2) in order to be able to prove the\nanalogue of the second statement above. In the Kac-Moody case this condition is\nautomatically fulfilled by a theorem of Caprace and R\u00e9my. In all cases, the geometry of the underlying Coxeter complex will play a crucial role in the proof via the\nexistence of 'a fundamental hyperbolic configuration', see Theorem 5.3.\n2 Framework\nWe study complete Kac-Moody groups; these were introduced in [14] under the\nname 'topological Kac-Moody groups'. A complete Kac-Moody group is a geometrically defined completion of an abstract Kac-Moody group over a finite field.\nEvery Kac-Moody group is a group-valued functor, G say, on rings, which is defined by a Chevalley-Steinberg type presentation, whose main parameter is an integral matrix, a 'generalized Cartan matrix', which also defines a Coxeter system\nof finite rank; see [16, Subsection 3.6] and [13, Section 9] for details. For each\nring R, the value G := G(R) of the functor G on R is an abstract Kac-Moody\ngroup over R.\nFor each field R the Chevalley-Steinberg presentation endows the abstract KacMoody group G(R) with the structure of a group with a twin root datum, which\nis the context in which our results are stated. A twin root datum is a collection\n\n\f4\n\nU. Baumgartner et al.\n\n\u0001\n(U\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2208\u03a6 , H of subgroups of G indexed by the set \u03a6 of roots of the associated\nCoxeter system (W, S) and satisfying certain axioms which ensure that the group\nG acts on a 'twinned' pair of buildings of type (W, S); see [13, 1.5.1]. See Subsection 0.3, respectively 0.4, in [5] for the list of axioms of a twin root datum and\nreferences to further literature on twin root data and twin buildings.\nIn order to define the geometric completion of G(R), assume that R is a finite\nfield. Under this assumption all the groups which constitute the natural root datum\nof G(R) are finite; groups with a twin root datum having this property will be\ncalled groups with a locally finite twin root datum. The Davis-realization of\nthe buildings defined by a locally finite twin root datum are locally finite, metric,\nCAT(0)-complexes in the sense of [3] all of whose cells have finite diameter;\nsee [1, Section 1.1] for a short explanation following M. Davis' exposition in [6].\nThe geometric completion of a group G with locally finite twin root datum is\nthe closure of the image of G in the automorphism group of the Davis-realization\nof the positive building defined by the given root datum; if G is an abstract KacMoody group over a finite field that completion will be called the corresponding\ncomplete Kac-Moody group and denoted by G.\nThe completion of an abstract Kac-Moody group is defined by its action on\nits building and our techniques rely on the CAT(0)-geometry of the building, in\nparticular the action of the group 'at infinity'. However, note that the topology\nand the completion of a group with locally finite twin root datum do not depend\non the CAT(0)-structure, only on the combinatorics of the action on the building;\nsee Lemma 2 in [1]. Therefore one should be able to dispense with the use of the\nDavis-realization below.\nWe summarize the basic topological properties of automorphism groups of\nlocally finite complexes in the following proposition.\nProposition 2.1 Let X be a connected, locally finite cell complex. Then the compact-open topology on Aut (X) is a locally compact, totally disconnected (hence\nHausdorff) group topology. This topology has a countable basis, hence is \u03c3 compact and metrizable. Stabilizers and fixators of finite subcomplexes of X in\nAut (X) are compact, open subgroups of Aut (X) and the collection of all fixators\nof finite subcomplexes form a neighborhood basis of the identity in Aut (X). These\nstatements are also true for closed subgroups of Aut (X).\nAny closed subgroup, G say, of Aut (X), which admits a finite subcomplex\nwhose G-translates cover X, is compactly generated and cocompact in Aut (X).\nComplete Kac-Moody groups hence have all the properties described above,\nincluding compact generation and co-compactness in the full automorphism group\nof its building even though we will not use the latter two properties in this paper.\n3 Geometric reformulation of topological group concepts\nIn what follows, we reformulate topological group concepts in geometric terms,\nthat is in terms of the action on the building. We begin with a geometric reformulation of relative compactness.\nA closed subgroup G of the automorphism group of a connected, locally finite,\nmetric complex X carries two natural structures of bornological group.\n\n\fContraction groups in complete Kac-Moody groups\n\n5\n\nThe first bornological group structure on G is the natural bornology induced\nby its topological group structure, and consists of the collection of all relatively\ncompact subsets of the group G.\nThe second bornological group structure on G is the bornology induced by the\nnatural bornology on the metric space X, in which subsets of X are bounded if\nand only if they have finite diameter; this bornology on the group G consists of\nthe collection of subsets M of G which have the property that for every bounded\nsubset B of X the set M.B is also bounded. One can verify that the latter condition\non the subset M of G is equivalent to the condition that for some, and hence any,\npoint x of X the set M.x is bounded. We will call the sets in the second bornology\non the group G bounded sets.\nWe now verify that these two bornologies coincide. For subsets Y , W of the\nmetric space X define TransG (Y, W ) := {g \u2208 G : g.Y \u2286 W }. Note that\n(\ngwy Gy = Gw gwy = Gw gwy Gy\nTransG ({y}, {w}) =\n\u2205\n\nif \u2203 gwy \u2208 G : gwy .y = w\nelse\n\nHence, whenever G is a closed subgroup of the automorphism group of a connected, locally finite complex X and y, w are points of X, the set TransG ({y}, {w})\nwill be compact and open.\nLemma 3.1 (geometric reformulation of 'relatively compact') Let X be a connected, locally finite, metric complex, and assume that G is a closed subgroup of\nAut (X) equipped with the compact-open topology. Then a subset of G is relatively\ncompact if and only if it is bounded.\nProof We will use the criterion that a subset M of G is bounded if and only if, for\nsome chosen vertex, x say, the set M.x is bounded.\nAssume first that M is a bounded subset of G. This means that M.x is a\nbounded, hence finite set of vertices. We conclude that\nM\u2286\n\n[\n\nTransG ({x}, {y}) ,\n\ny\u2208M.x\n\nwhich shows that M is a relatively compact subset of G.\nConversely, assume that M is a relatively compact subset of G. We have\nM\u2286\n\n[\n\nTransG ({x}, {y}) .\n\ny\u2208X\n\nand, since M is relatively compact, there is a finite subset F(M, x) of X such that\nM\u2286\n\n[\n\nTransG ({x}, {y}) =: T (M, x) .\n\ny\u2208F(M,x)\n\nWe conclude that M.x \u2286 T (M, x).x \u2286 F(M, x) which shows that M is bounded.\n\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\n\f6\n\nU. Baumgartner et al.\n\n3.1 Geometric reformulation of topological properties of isometries\nUnder the additional condition that the complex X carries a CAT(0)-structure, we\nuse the previous result to reformulate the topological condition on a group element\nto be (topologically) periodic in dynamical terms.\nLemma 3.2 (weak geometric reformulation of 'topologically periodic') Let X\nbe a connected, locally finite, metric CAT(0)-complex. Equip Aut (X) with the\ncompact-open topology and let g be an element of Aut (X). Then g is topologically\nperiodic if and only if g has a fixed point.\nProof By Lemma 3.1, g is topologically periodic if and only if the group generated\nby g is bounded. Since a bounded group of automorphisms of a complete CAT(0)space has a fixed point, topologically periodic elements have fixed points.\nConversely, if g fixes the point x say, then g, and the group it generates, is\ncontained in the compact set Aut (X)x . Hence g is topologically periodic.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nOne can even detect the property of being topologically periodic in a purely\ngeometric way: isometries of CAT(0)-spaces which do not have fixed points are\neither parabolic or hyperbolic. If, in the previous lemma, we impose the additional\ncondition that the complex X should have finitely many isometry classes of cells,\nthen X is known to have no parabolic isometries and we obtain the following neat\ncharacterization.\nLemma 3.3 (strong geometric reformulation of 'topologically periodic') Let\nX be a connected, locally finite, metric CAT(0)-complex with finitely many isometry classes of cells. Equip Aut (X) with the compact-open topology and let g be\nan element of Aut (X). Then the following properties are equivalent:\n1. g is topologically periodic;\n2. g has a fixed point;\n3. g is not hyperbolic.\nProof The assumption that the complex X has finitely many isometry classes of\ncells implies that no isometry of X is parabolic by a theorem of Bridson [3, II.6.6\nExercise (2) p. 231]. This shows that the second and third statement of the lemma\nare equivalent. The first and the second statement are equivalent by Lemma 3.2,\nwhich concludes the proof.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nIn the case of interest to us, we can add a further characterization of 'topologically periodic' to those given above and we include it for completeness although\nwe will not need to use it. The scale referred to in the statement is defined as\nin [17] and [18].\nLemma 3.4 (scale characterization of 'topologically periodic') If G is the geometric completion of a group with locally finite twin root datum (or the full automorphism group of its building) the following statements are also equivalent to\nthe statements (1)\u2013(3) of Lemma 3.3:\n4. the scale value sG (g) is equal to 1;\n5. the scale value sG (g\u22121 ) is equal to 1;\nFurthermore, sG (g) = sG (g\u22121 ) for all g in G.\nProof This statement follows form Corollary 10 and Corollary 5 in [1].\n\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\n\fContraction groups in complete Kac-Moody groups\n\n7\n\n3.2 Geometric reformulation of the topological definition of a contraction group\nIt follows from Lemma 3.4 and Proposition 3.24 in [2] that in the geometric completion of a group with locally finite twin root datum contraction groups of topologically periodic elements are bounded while the contraction groups of elements\nwhich are not topologically periodic are unbounded. In particular this observation\napplies to topological Kac-Moody groups.\nThe following lemma explains why in this paper we focus on contraction\ngroups of non-topologically periodic elements. Note that we relax notation and\ndenote the contraction group of inner conjugation with g by Ug .\nLemma 3.5 (contraction group of a topologically periodic element) Suppose\nthat g is a topologically periodic element of a locally compact group. Then the\ncontraction group Ug is trivial and hence closed.\nProof This is a special case of Lemma 3.5 in [2] where v = g and d = e.\n\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\nMembership in contraction groups can be detected by examining the growth\nof fixed point sets while going to infinity. The precise formulation is as follows.\nLemma 3.6 (geometric reformulation of 'membership in a contraction group')\nLet X be a connected, locally finite, metric CAT(0)-complex. Equip Aut (X) with\nthe compact-open topology. Suppose that h is an hyperbolic isometry of X and let\n\u2212\u03be be its repelling fixed point at infinity. Let l : R \u2192 X be a geodesic line with\nl(\u221e) = \u2212\u03be .\nThen an isometry g of X is in Uh if and only if for each r > 0 there is a real\nnumber p(g, r) such that all points in X within distance r of the ray l([p(g, r), \u221e))\nare fixed by g.\nProof The assumption l(\u221e) = \u2212\u03be implies that we may assume without loss of\ngenerality that l is an axis of h.\nSuppose now that g is an isometry of X and let r(g, n) be the radius of the\nball around P(g, n) := h\u2212n .l(0) that is fixed by g, with the convention that r(g, n)\nequals \u2212\u221e if g does not fix the point P(g, n). By the definition of the contraction\ngroup Uh and the topology on Aut (X) the element g is contained in Uh if and only\nif r(g, n) goes to infinity as n goes to infinity.\nSince g is an isometry and l is an axis of h, the points P(g, n) for n in N\nare equally spaced along l(R). Therefore we may reformulate the condition for\nmembership in Uh given at the end of the last paragraph as in the statement of the\nlemma.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nThe results in Lemma3.5, Lemma 3.3 and Lemma 3.6 imply the following\ndichotomy for contraction groups.\nLemma 3.7 (dichotomy for contraction groups) If X is a connected, locally\nfinite, metric CAT(0)-complex with finitely many isometry classes of cells then\nwe have the following dichotomy for contraction groups associated to isometries\nof X.\n\u2013 Either the isometry is elliptic and its contraction group is trivial,\n\u2013 or the isometry is hyperbolic and its contraction group is the set of isometries\nwhose fixed point set grows without bounds when one approaches its repelling\nfixed point at infinity as described in Lemma 3.6.\n\n\f8\n\nU. Baumgartner et al.\n\n3.3 Geometric reformulation of the topological definition of a parabolic group\nUsing the compatibility result between the natural bornologies in Lemma 3.1 we\ncan also prove a geometric characterization for membership in parabolic groups.\nWe again relax notation and denote the parabolic group of inner conjugation with g\nby Pg .\nLemma 3.8 (geometric reformulation of 'membership in a parabolic group')\nLet X be a connected, locally finite, metric CAT(0)-complex. Suppose that h is a\nhyperbolic isometry of X and let \u2212\u03be be its repelling fixed point at infinity. Then\nPh is the stabilizer of \u2212\u03be .\nProof Suppose first that g is an element of Ph . Let o be a point of X. By our\nassumption on g and by Lemma 3.1 there is a constant M(g, o) such that\nd(hn gh\u2212n .o, o) = d(g.(h\u2212n .o), (h\u2212n .o)) < M(g, o) for all n \u2208 N .\nBut the point \u2212\u03be is the limit of the sequence (h\u2212n .o)n\u2208N and thus by the definition\nof points at infinity of X we infer that g fixes \u2212\u03be .\nConversely, assume that g fixes the point \u2212\u03be . The above argument can be\nreversed and then shows that g is contained in Ph .\n\u2294\n\u2293\nThere is a dichotomy for parabolic groups that is analogous to the dichotomy\nfor contraction groups obtained in Lemma 3.7; the statement is as follows.\nLemma 3.9 (dichotomy for parabolic groups) If X is a connected, locally finite,\nmetric CAT(0)-complex with finitely many isometry classes of cells then we have\nthe following dichotomy for parabolic groups associated to isometries of X.\n\u2013 Either the isometry is elliptic and its parabolic group is the ambient group,\n\u2013 or the isometry is hyperbolic and its parabolic group is the stabilizer of its\nrepelling fixed point at infinity.\nProof Applying Lemma 3.5 in [2] in the case of parabolic groups with v = g\nand d = e one sees that parabolic groups defined by topologically periodic elements are equal to the ambient group; this settles the first possibility listed above.\nBy Lemma 3.3 an isometry that is not elliptic must be hyperbolic and then the\nparabolic group has the claimed form by Lemma 3.8.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nWe conclude this section with the following remark.\nRemark 3.10 Suppose G is a topological group, g \u2208 Aut (G) and H is a g-stable\nsubgroup of G. Then the contraction group of g in H is the intersection of the\ncontraction group of g in G with H; an analogous statement is true for the parabolic\ngroups of g within H and G. Thus the geometric characterizations of contraction\ngroups and parabolics given in Lemmas 3.6 and 3.8 and the dichotomies described\nin Lemma 3.7 and 3.9 also hold for subgroups of Aut (X) for the specified spaces\nX.\n\n\fContraction groups in complete Kac-Moody groups\n\n9\n\n4 Outline of the proof of the Main Theorem\nWe know from Lemma 3.5 that contraction groups of topologically periodic elements are trivial and hence closed. This proves statement 1 of our Main Theorem.\nUnder the additional condition on the type of the Weyl group given in statement 2, we will show that for any non-topologically periodic element, h say, of G\nthe group Uh \u2229 Uh\u22121 contains a G-conjugate of a root group from the natural root\ndatum for G.\n\n4.1 The criterion implying non-closed contraction groups\nTheorem 3.32 in [2] gives 12 equivalent conditions for a contraction group in a\nmetric totally disconnected, locally compact group to be closed. By the equivalence of conditions (1) and (4) from Theorem 3.32 in [2] the group Uh is not\nclosed if and only if the group U h \u2229U h\u22121 is not trivial, hence the property whose\nverification we announced in the previous paragraph confirms statement 2 of our\nMain Theorem. The proof of this strengthening of statement 2 of Theorem 1.1\nproceeds in three steps.\n1. Firstly, we show that any geodesic line, l say, can be moved to a line l \u2032 = g.l\nwith image in the standard apartment by a suitable element g of the completed\ngroup G. In what follows we will be interested only in the case where the line\nl is an axis of a hyperbolic isometry h \u2208 G.\n2. Secondly, we use the assumption on the type of the Weyl group to show that for\nany geodesic line l \u2032 in the standard apartment there is a triple of roots (\u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 )\nin \"fundamental hyperbolic configuration\" with respect to l. By this we mean\nthat \u03b1 , \u03b2 and \u03b3 are pairwise non-opposite pairwise disjoint roots, such that the\ntwo ends of l \u2032 are contained in the respective interiors of \u03b1 and \u03b2 .\n3. Thirdly and finally, we use that every split or almost split Kac-Moody group\nhas (uniformly) contractive root groups, a notion introduced in Subsection 4.2\nbelow, to arrive at the announced conclusion. More precisely, the geometric\ncriterion for membership in contraction groups is used to show that whenever\nh\u2032 is a hyperbolic isometry in G, the line l \u2032 is an axis of h\u2032 contained in the\nstandard apartment and the fundamental hyperbolic configuration (\u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 ) is\nchosen as mentioned in the previous item, then the root group U\u2212\u03b3 is contained\nin the group Uh\u2032 \u2229Uh\u2032 \u22121 .\nIn terms of the originally chosen hyperbolic isometry h and the element g of\nG found in step 1 above, the conclusion arrived at after step 3 is that g\u22121U\u2212\u03b3 g \u2286\nUh \u2229Uh\u22121 .\nFor our proof to work, we do not need to assume that our original group G\nis the abstract Kac-Moody group over a finite field. Step 1 uses that the group\nis a completion of a group with a locally finite twin root datum, Step 2 uses a\nproperty of the corresponding Coxeter complex and Step 3 works for groups with\na locally finite twin root datum whose root groups are contractive, a notion which\nwe introduce now.\n\n\f10\n\nU. Baumgartner et al.\n\n4.2 Contractive root groups\nAs explained above, the following condition will play a central role in the proof of\nour Main Theorem. In the formulation of that condition, we denote the boundary\nwall of the half-apartment defined by a root \u03b1 by \u2202 \u03b1 , as is customary.\nDefinition 4.1 Let G be a group with twin root datum (U\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2208\u03a6 . We say that G\nhas contractive root groups if and only if for all \u03b1 in \u03a6 we have: If x is a point\nin the half-apartment defined by \u03b1 , then the radius of the ball around x which is\nfixed pointwise by U\u03b1 goes to infinity as the distance of x to \u2202 \u03b1 goes to infinity.\nThe natural system of root groups of any split or almost split Kac-Moody\ngroup satisfies a stronger, uniform version of the condition of contractive root\ngroups, which we introduce now. This latter condition was called condition (FPRS)\nin [5], where it was shown in Proposition 4 that any split or almost split KacMoody group satisfies it.\nDefinition 4.2 Let G be a group with twin root datum (U\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2208\u03a6 . We say that G has\nuniformly contractive root groups if and only if for each point x in the standard\napartment of the positive building defined by the given root datum and all roots \u03b1\nin \u03a6 whose corresponding half-apartment contains x, the radius of the ball which\nis fixed pointwise by U\u03b1 goes to infinity as the distance of \u2202 \u03b1 to x goes to infinity.\nRemark 4.3 By Lemma 3.6, for a group, G say, with twin root datum (U\u03b1 )\u03b1 \u2208\u03a6 ,\nwhich has contractive root groups, for any root \u03b1 the root group U\u03b1 is contained\nin the contraction group of any element g of G whose repelling point at infinity is\ndefined by a geodesic ray contained in the interior of the half-apartment defined\nby \u03b1 . The latter condition will be instrumental in showing our main theorem.\nAbramenko and M\u00fchlherr constructed an example of a group with twin root\ndatum that does not have uniformly contractive root groups. However, in that example the effect of fixed point sets staying bounded is obtained by going towards\ninfinity along a non-periodic path of chambers. Therefore, it is not possible to find\nan automorphism of the building that translates in the direction of that path.\nIn discussions between the authors and Bernhard M\u00fchlherr he asserted that\na bound on the nilpotency degree of subgroups of the group with twin root datum would imply that fixed point sets always grow without bounds along periodic\npaths.\nRemark 4.4 It would be interesting to define and investigate quantitative versions\nof the notions of contractive and uniformly contractive root groups for groups\nwith locally finite twin root datum. These quantitative versions would specify the\ngrowth of the radius of the ball fixed by a root group as a function of the distance of\nthe center of that ball from the boundary hyperplane. We suspect that this growth\nmight be linear in all situations if and only if all contraction groups of elements in\nthe geometric completion of a group with locally finite twin root datum are closed.\n5 Proof of the Main Theorem\nWe will prove the following generalization of our Main Theorem.\n\n\fContraction groups in complete Kac-Moody groups\n\n11\n\nTheorem 5.1 (strong version of the Main Theorem) Let G be a group with a\nlocally finite twin root datum and G the closure of the image of G in the automorphism group of its positive building. Then the following are true:\n1. The contraction group of any topologically periodic element in G is trivial.\n2. If the root groups of G are contractive and the type of G is irreducible and\nneither spherical nor affine then the contraction group of any element that is\nnot topologically periodic in G is not closed.\nFurthermore every element of infinite order in the Weyl group of G lifts to a nontopologically periodic element of G; in particular, if the Weyl group of G is not of\nspherical type, then the group G contains non-topologically periodic elements.\nThe proof of this theorem will be obtained from several smaller results as outlined in Subsection 4.1 above. By Lemma 3.5, we only need to prove statement 2\nand the existence statement for non-topologically periodic elements.\nThe first step towards the proof of statement 2 of Theorem 5.1 is provided by\nthe following proposition.\nProposition 5.2 (geodesic lines can be moved to the standard apartment) Let\nG a group with locally finite twin root datum. Denote by G the geometric completion of G defined by the given root datum, by X the Davis-realization of the\ncorresponding positive building and by A the corresponding standard apartment.\nIf l is a geodesic line in X, then there is an element g in G such that g.l(R) is\ncontained in |A| and intersects the fundamental chamber.\nProof Since the group G acts transitively on chambers, there is an element g\u2032 in G\nsuch that g\u2032 .l(R) intersects the fundamental chamber c0 \u2208 A. We therefore may,\nand will, assume that l(R) intersects c0 from the outset.\nWhenever l leaves A, necessarily at a wall, use elements of the corresponding root group U\u03b1 which fixes c0 to 'fold l into A' . This needs to be done at\nincreasing distance from c0 along l 'on both sides', leading to an infinite product\nof elements from root groups. The sequence consisting of the partial products of\nthat infinite product is contained in the stabilizer of c0 , which is a compact set.\nHence that sequence has a convergent subsequence, which implies that the infinite\nproduct defined above is convergent, with limit g say. By construction, g attains\nthe purpose of the element of the same name in the statement of the proposition\nand we are done.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nThe second step in the proof of statment 2 of Theorem 5.1 consists of the\nfollowing strengthening of Theorem 14 in [5].\nTheorem 5.3 (a \"fundamental hyperbolic configuration\" exists w.r.t. any line)\nLet A be a Coxeter complex, whose type is irreducible and neither spherical nor\naffine. Suppose that l : R \u2192 |A| is a geodesic line. Then there is a triple of roots\n(\u03b1 , \u03b2 , \u03b3 ) which are pairwise disjoint and pairwise non-opposite such that for suitably chosen real numbers a and b the rays l(] \u2212 \u221e, a]) and l([b, \u221e[) are contained\nin the interior of the half-apartments defined by \u03b1 and \u03b2 respectively.\nProof The line l(R) must cut some wall of A, H say. One of the two roots whose\nboundary is H contains the ray l(] \u2212 \u221e, a]) for sufficiently small a; we name that\n\n\f12\n\nU. Baumgartner et al.\n\nroot \u03b1 . Since the Coxeter complex is not of spherical type, there is another wall\nH \u2032 which cuts l, but not H. Call \u03b2 the root whose boundary is H \u2032 and which\ncontains the ray l([b, \u221e[) for sufficiently large b. The existence of a root \u03b3 as in the\nstatement is then assured by Theorem 14 in [5], which completes the proof.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nThe third and final step in the proof of statment 2 of Theorem 5.1 is an immediate consequence of our assumption that root groups are contractive and the\ngeometric criterion for membership in contraction groups.\nLemma 5.4 (non-triviality of intersection of opposite contraction groups) Let\nG be a group which contains the root groups of a group with twin root datum all of\nwhose root groups are contractive. Assume that h \u2208 G is not topologically periodic\nand let l be an axis of h. If \u03b3 is a root whose position relative to l is as described\nin the previous lemma, then U\u2212\u03b3 \u2286 Uh \u2229Uh\u22121 . Hence, Uh is not closed.\nProof Since the root group U\u2212\u03b3 is contractive, Lemma 3.6 ensures that it is contained in any contraction group Uk with the property that the repelling fixed point\nof k at infinity is defined by a ray that is contained in the interior of the halfapartment defined by \u2212\u03b3 . Both h and h\u22121 satisfy this condition on k, hence U\u2212\u03b3 \u2286\nUh \u2229Uh\u22121 as claimed. Since U\u2212\u03b3 is not trivial, we infer from Theorem 3.32 in [2]\nthat Uh is not closed.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nThe following lemma provides the final statement of Theorem 5.1 and thereby\nconcludes the proof of that theorem.\nLemma 5.5 (existence of non-topologically periodic elements) Let G be a group\nwith a locally finite twin root datum and G the closure of the image of G in the\nautomorphism group of its positive building. Then every element of infinite order\nin the Weyl group of G lifts to a non-topologically periodic element of G; in particular, if the Weyl group of G is not of spherical type, then the group G contains\nnon-topologically periodic elements.\nProof Since a Coxeter group is torsion if and only if it is of spherical type, the\nsecond claim follows from the first. In what follows, we will show that the lift of\nan element w in the Weyl group is topologically periodic if and only if w has finite\norder.\nBy Lemma 3.3, an element, n say, of G is topologically periodic if and only\nif its action on the building, X, has a fixed point. If that element n is obtained as\nan inverse image of an element, w say, of the Weyl group, it belongs to the stabilizer of the standard apartment A. Since the Davis-realization |A| of the standard\napartment is a complete, convex subspace of the complete CAT(0)-space X, using\nthe nearest-point projection from X onto |A|, we see that the action of n on X\nhas a fixed point if and only if its restricted action on |A| has a fixed point. The\nlatter condition is equivalent to the condition that the natural action of w on |A|\nhas a fixed point. Since this happens if and only if w has finite order, our claim is\nproved.\n\u2294\n\u2293\n6 The case of a disconnected Dynkin diagram\nThe following two results may be used to reduce the determination of contraction\ngroups for elements in arbitrary complete Kac-Moody groups to the determination\n\n\fContraction groups in complete Kac-Moody groups\n\n13\n\nof the contraction groups in the factors defined by the irreducible components.\nTheir proofs are left to the reader.\nLemma 6.1 (product decomposition for root data with disconnected diagram)\nLet G be a group with a locally finite twin root datum such that the type of G is the\nproduct of irreducible factors whose restricted root data define groups G1 , . . . Gn .\nDenote by H the quotient of a group H by its center. Then\nG\u223c\nand\nG\u223c\n= G1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Gn .\n= G \u00d7***\u00d7G\n1\n\nn\n\nas abstract, respectively topological, groups.\n\n\u2294\n\u2293\n\nLemma 6.2 (contraction groups of elements in products) Let G1 , . . . , Gn be locally compact groups and (g1 , . . . , g1 ) \u2208 G1 \u00d7 . . . \u00d7 Gn . Then\nU(g1 ,...,gn ) = Ug1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7Ugn .\n\u2294\n\u2293\nWe conjecture that the contraction groups for elements in a complete KacMoody group of spherical or affine type are always closed. Supporting evidence\nfor that conjecture is provided by the following proposition.\nProposition 6.3 (contraction groups for spherical and known affine types) Let\nG be a totally disconnected, locally compact group. If\n1. either G is the geometric completion of an abstract Kac-Moody group of spherical type over a finite field,\n2. or G is a topological subgroup of the general linear group over a local field,\nthen all contraction groups of elements in G are closed.\nProof To show statement 1, observe that an abstract Kac-Moody group of spherical type over a finite field is a finite group. The associated complete group, G,\nis then finite too and hence is a discrete group, because its topology is Hausdorff.\nContraction groups in a discrete group are trivial, and it follows that all contraction\ngroups of all elements in G are closed if G is of spherical type.\nAs noted in Remark 3.10, we obtain the contraction group of an element h\nwith respect to a (topological) subgroup, H by intersecting the contraction group\nrelative to the ambient group with H.\nThus to establish statement 2 it is enough to treat the special case of the\ngeneral linear group over a local field, k say. Using the same observation again\nand noting that GLn (k) can be realized as a closed subgroup of SLn+1 (k) via\ng 7\u2192 diag(g, det(g)\u22121 ), it suffices to prove statement 2 in the special case of the\ngroup SLn (k), where k is a local field. But contraction groups of elements in\nSLn (k) have been shown to be k-rational points of unipotent radicals of k-parabolic\nsubgroups in [12, Lemma 2] as explained in Example 3.13(1) in [2]; as such they\nare Zariski-closed and hence closed in the Hausdorff-topology induced by the field\nk. This proves statement 2 for the group SLn (k), and, by the previous reductions,\nin all cases.\n\u2294\n\u2293\nThere are complete Kac-Moody groups of affine type for which it is unknown\nwhether the criterion listed under item 2 of Proposition 6.3 can be applied. For\nexample,\u0012the complete\nKac-Moody groups defined by the generalized Cartan\u0013\n2 m\nmatrices\nwith integral m < \u22124 are of that kind.\n\u22121 2\n\n\f14\n\nU.
