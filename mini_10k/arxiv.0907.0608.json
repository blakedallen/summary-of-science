Introduction\nCoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) is a minisatellite launched on December 26, 2006 and developed by\nthe French Space agency CNES (Centre National d'Etudes\nSpatiales) in collaboration with the Science Programmes of ESA\n(European Space Agency), Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany\nand Spain. The main objectives are to detect exoplanets and to\nprobe the interiors of stars using asteroseismology (Baglin et al.\n2006). The high-perfomance photometric data offer an unprecedented opportunity to detect extremely low amplitude oscillations in many stars (Michel et al. 2008b), in particular, in solarlike oscillating stars. The main programme of the CoRoT mission consists of 5-month-long runs during which ten designated\ntargets are almost continuously monitored with a 32-s cadence\nfor seismic studies. Several solar-like oscillation stars have al?\nCoRoT (Convection, Rotation and planetary Transits) is a minisatellite developed by the French Space agency CNES in collaboration\nwith the Science Programs of ESA, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Germany\nand Spain.\n\nready been observed with CoRoT (Garc\u0131\u0301a et al. 2008). One of\nthem is HD 181906, a faint F8 star which has been observed during the first long run looking into the galactic centre direction at\nthe same time as HD 181420 (Barban et al. 2009).\nIn the present paper we report the first detailed seismic analysis of HD 181906 using CoRoT data. We first present some\nclassical characteristics of the star and infer some expected pulsation properties in Sect. 2; after a description of the CoRoT\nobservations (Sect. 3), we derive the surface rotation of the star\n(Sect. 4), we then determine the region where the p modes are\n(Sect. 5) and we explain how to take into account the convective\nbackground (Sect. 6). We finish by analysing the p-mode spectrum (Sect. 7) and extracting the p-mode parameters (Sect.8).\n\n2. Stellar parameters and estimated oscillation\nproperties\nThe star HD 181906 (or HIP 95221) is known as an F8 dwarf\nwith a magnitude mv = 7.65 and is probably a binary system\nas suggested by astrometric measurements (Makarov & Kaplan\n\n\f2\n\nGarc\u0131\u0301a et al.: HD 181906\n\n2005; Frankowski et al. 2007) or high-resolution spectroscopy\n(Bruntt 2009). The new reduction of Hipparcos data by van\nLeeuwen (2007) provides a parallax \u03c0 = 14.72 \u00b1 0.91 mas (i.e.\na distance d = 68 \u00b1 4 pc), which leads to an absolute magnitude\nof MV = 3.49 \u00b1 0.13. Using BCV = \u22120.044 \u00b1 0.058 for the bolometric correction in the V band (Masana et al. 2006), we deduce\nthe stellar luminosity L = 3.32 \u00b1 0.45 L . Very recently Bruntt\n(2009) has derived global parameters for this star from highresolution spectroscopy. He found a value of T eff = 6300\u00b1150 K\nwhich is in perfect agreement with the value he derived from\n2MASS photometry (T eff = 6360 \u00b1 100 K). He also deduced a\nsurface gravity log g = 4.220 \u00b1 0.056 and a metallicity [Fe/H]\n= \u22120.11\u00b1 0.14. Using his observations as inputs for stellar modelling, he estimated for this star a mass M = 1.144 \u00b1 0.119 M ,\na radius R = 1.392 \u00b1 0.054 R and an age of 4.2 \u00b1 1.6 Gyr.\nThese values have been hereafter used to approximate seismic\nquantities and are summarized Table 1.\nTable 1. Global parameters of HD 181906 used for this work.\n\u03c0\nL/L\nT eff\nlog g\n[Fe/H]\nv sin i\nM/M\nR/R\n\n14.72 \u00b1 0.91 mas\n3.32 \u00b1 0.45\n6300 \u00b1 150 K\n4.220 \u00b1 0.056\n\u22120.11 \u00b1 0.14 dex\n10 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121\n1.144 \u00b1 0.119\n1.392 \u00b1 0.054\n\nWe have compared these values to those derived in previous works using differents techniques. This star is included\nin the Geneva-Copenhagen survey of the Solar neighbourhood\n(Nordstr\u00f6m et al. (2004) revisited by Holmberg et al. (2007)).\nThis survey, mainly based on Str\u00f6mgren photometry, provides\nan effective temperature T eff = 6382 \u00b1 91 K and metallicity [Fe/H] = \u22120.18 \u00b1 0.10 dex. The age is also estimated to\n+0.06\n2.7+0.3\n\u22120.4 Gyr and the mass to 1.22\u22120.07 M . All of these values are\nin very good agreement with those of Bruntt (2009). By using\nV and 2MASS IR photometry, Masana et al. (2006) recover a\nslightly higher effective temperature of 6532 \u00b1 66 K and provide\nan angular semi-diameter SD = 0.102 \u00b1 0.001 mas. Thus, using the new Hipparcos parallax, we estimate the stellar radius to\n1.50 \u00b1 0.10 R 1 , which is consistent with Bruntt (2009).\nFor the the rotation velocity, Nordstr\u00f6m et al. (2004) have reported a measurement based on earlier CORAVEL observations\nand have estimated the rotation velocity v sin i \u2248 16 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 .\nHowever, according to Bruntt (2009), this value is overestimated\ndue to the blend with a second star. By taking into account the\npresence of this second star, v sin i decreases to 10 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 .\nFor consistency reasons, we have considered the latter.\nUsing these parameters, we are able to obtain approximate\nvalues of some global seismic parameters using scaling laws.\nThe large separation, \u2206\u03bd, can be estimated from the mass and\nthe radius as follows (Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995):\n\u2206\u03bd =\n\nM\nM\n\n!1/2\n*\n\nR\nR\n\n!\u22123/2\n* 135 \u03bcHz .\n\n(1)\n\nA value of \u2206\u03bd \u2248 88 \u00b1 7 \u03bcHz has been obtained.\n1\n\nthis number is 5% lower that the one derived by Masana et al.\n(2006), since the parallax has been revised, but is fully compatible\nwithin the error bar.\n\nThe frequency of the maximum of the p modes scales as\nthe cut-off frequency (Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995). This law\nhas lately been verified using spectrometric data (Bedding &\nKjeldsen 2003). Therefore we can express \u03bdmax as follows:\n\u03bdmax =\n\nM/M\n(R/R )2 *\n\nq\n\n* 3050 \u03bcHz .\n\n(2)\n\nT eff\n5777\n\nWe obtain \u03bdmax \u2248 1725 \u00b1 225 \u03bcHz\nFinally, the maximum expected amplitude (an estimate of the\nintrinsic mode amplitude in terms of bolometric intensity fluctuations) can be deduced from Samadi et al. (2007b):\ns\n!\n!\nL/L 0.7\n5777\ndL\n=\nAmax =\n*\n* A max\n(3)\nL max\nM/M\nTeff\nwhere we have changed the solar value of A max = 2.6 ppm to\n2.53 \u00b1 0.11 ppm obtained by calibrating different helioseismic\nmeasurements of the VIRGO/SoHO package (POM6 & SPM)\n(Michel et al. 2009). This gives a value of Amax \u2248 5.1 \u00b1 0.6 ppm\nfor HD 181906. This relation is the combination of two different\nones: the adiabatic relation proposed by Kjeldsen & Bedding\n(1995) to relate mode amplitudes in intensity to mode amplitudes in velocity and the scaling law proposed by Samadi et al.\n(2007b) which gives the mode amplitudes in velocity as a function of (L/M).\n\n3. CoRoT Observations\n156.6 days of continuous data \u2013 from 2007 May 11 until 2007\nOctober 15 \u2013 have been collected with an overall duty cycle\nof 89.3 %. Most of the gaps (each of a few minutes duration)\nare due to data loss during the crossings of the South Atlantic\nAnomaly (see for a detailed explanation: Auvergne et al. 2009).\nThese gaps have been linearly interpolated in the light curve to\navoid putting zeros. We have verified that this interpolation does\nnot introduce any spurious frequencies in the Fourier domain.\nThe original 1-s cadence raw data have been corrected and calibrated into level-2 (or N2) data following the methods described\nin Samadi et al. (2007a). The N2 light curve is sampled on a regular grid in the heliocentric frame with a cadence of 32s. Then\nwe have removed a low-frequency trend due to the aging of the\nCCD (Auvergne et al. 2009), and finally we have removed some\noutlier points (0.013%). The resultant lightcurve shows a small\nmodulation during the first 60 days (see Fig. 1) and then a very\nflat behavior. At this point, it is not possible to disentangle a\nreal modulation of the star from an instrumental effect. A second modulation \u2013 of around 3 days \u2013 is also visible and could be\nrelated to the surface rotation due to the signature of magnetic\nactivity on the surface of the star.\nTo compute the power spectrum density (PSD) we have used\na standard Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and normalized it\nas the so-called one-sided power spectral density (Press et al.\n1992). The resultant PSD is shown in Fig. 2.\nIn the PSD, several peaks rise above the general trend dominated by the photon noise from the Nyquist frequency down to\napproximately 100 \u03bcHz, and by the convective noise from this\nfrequency until \u223c10 \u03bcHz (Michel et al. 2008a). Below this, the\nspectrum is dominated by two peaks, at around 4 and 8 \u03bcHz, that\ncould be the signature of the surface rotation of the star \u2013 already\nseen in its lightcurve \u2013 as well as its first harmonic (red dotted\nlines in Fig 2). We will discuss in detail this rotation rate in the\n\n\fGarc\u0131\u0301a et al.: HD 181906\n\n3\n\naround \u223c2000 \u03bcHz. A more sophisticated treatment is necessary\nto clearly unveil the acoustic spectrum of this star.\n\n4. Surface rotation\n\nFig. 1. N2-Light curve (in ppm) corrected for the aging of the\nCCD and interpolated onto a regular grid in the heliocentric\nframe.\n\nAs we have already mentioned in previous sections, the light\ncurve of HD 181906 shows a periodic modulation of about 3\ndays that produces two peaks in the PSD. It is interesting to analyse this periodicity in a more detailed way.\nWe have started by calculating a time-period diagram using\nwavelets (Torrence & Compo 1998). The advantage of this technique relies on the fact that we use a wave, the Morlet wavelet \u2013\na sine wave modulated by a Gaussian (Goupillaud et al. 1984) \u2013\nwhich has a finite duration and a specific frequency. By changing the frequency of this wavelet and sliding it along our time\nseries, we calculate the correlation between the wavelet and the\ndata. That enables us to compute the Wavelet Power Spectrum\n(see Fig. 3). Most of the power is concentrated along a horizontal line centered at \u223c 2.8 days. This signal appears to be stronger\nduring the first half of the run than during the second period.\n\nFig. 3. Left: Wavelet power spectrum for HD 181906 at low\nfrequency. Right: Global Wavelet Power Spectrum where the\ndotted-line represents the 95% confidence level.\n\nFig. 2. Power spectrum density of the full 156-day N2-light\ncurve shown in Fig 1. The two red-dotted vertical lines show the\nlowest significant peak and the first harmonic that could be the\nsignature of the surface rotation of the star. The five blue-dotted\nvertical lines indicate the first harmonics of the orbital period of\nthe satellite.\nnext section. The signature of the CoRoT orbital periodicity produces a peak at 161.7 \u03bcHz together with several harmonics (blue\ndotted lines in Fig. 2).\nThe combination of a lower-than-expected signal-to-noise\nratio of the oscillation amplitudes (Michel et al. 2008a) with the\nfaintness of the target (mv =7.65) means that the p-mode hump is\nnot clearly visible in Fig. 2, but there is a small excess in power\n\nWith the Global Wavelet Power Spectrum defined as the horizontal average of the time-period diagram (see Fig. 3 (right)),\nwe observe that most of the power \u2013 more than 99% \u2013 is concentrated in this main periodicity at 2.81 days. A smaller peak\nis also visible at 1.41 days but containing much less power. This\nmethod (successfully tested with numerical simulations and with\nsolar data from the GOLF instrument (Mathur et al. 2008)) allows us to disentangle between the peak corresponding to the\nmain periodicity and that of the harmonic by the simple visual\ninspection of the PSD where 2 peaks of similar characteristics\nstand at 4.04 and 8.2 \u03bcHz.\nA closer inspection of the rotation period, Prot , in the PSD\nreveals that it is composed of a double structure, with a strong\npeak centered at 4 \u03bcHz \u2013 2.9 days (Fig. 4) \u2013 and a smaller one\nat 4.45 \u03bcHz (2.6 days). The fact of having these two peaks instead of just one may suggest the presence of spots at different\nlatitudes with a differential surface rotation. The spot modeling\ndone by Mosser et al. (2009a) states this point explicitly, indicating two rotation periods associated with a clear gradient of\nthe rotational velocity as a function of spot latitude. Another\nexplanation, less probable, is the presence of a hot star in the\nbackground of HD 181906, as suggested by Bruntt (2009) who\nproposed a detailed analysis of the fundamental parameters of\nCoRoT asteroseismic targets based on high-resolution spectrometric measurements.\nIf the 156-day time series is divided into two segments of\n78 days, or into three independent 52-day subsets, a slightly dif-\n\n\f4\n\nGarc\u0131\u0301a et al.: HD 181906\n\nTable 2.

In Fig. 6, the PSD\nof the first 52 days is plotted in black, the next 52 days is plotted\nin red, and the last 52-day segment is plotted in green. Details\nof the prominent peaks that appear in each of these spectra are\nsummarized in Table 2. In this table, we listed the frequencies\n(in \u03bcHz) and the respective rotational periods (in days) of the\npeaks that appear at low frequency in the Fourier spectrum of the\nfull-length series and the smaller subseries that we have considered in the analysis. The peaks are located at rotational periods\nin the range from 2.3 to 3.1 days. The different behavior of the\npeaks (in frequency and amplitude) \u2013 behavior that depends on\nthe observed period \u2013 suggests that they could be the signatures\nof differential rotation on the surface of the star, and not the rotation period of the secondary star in the binary system (which\nwould be expected to produce a stable peak in all the considered\nperiods). Therefore, HD 181906 shows a slightly larger differential rotation than the Sun, but of the same order of magnitude.\nA more detailed analysis of this behavior will be the topic of a\nfuture work.\n4.1. Constraining the inclination angle\n\nThe angle of inclination of HD 181906 can be inferred from the\nmeasured value of (v sin i)obs and the surface rotation that we\nhave just derived:\nFig. 5. Zoom on the spectrum at low frequency. In black the\nFourier spectrum of the first 78 days of data.

We recall this value is obtained by taking into\naccount the blend with a second star (Bruntt 2009). For comparison, by considering the older value of 16 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 , we would\nobtain an angle of 37.5 \u00b1 4.5\u25e6 . From the spot modeling (Mosser\net al. 2009a) a value of 45 \u00b1 10\u25e6 has been found. This parameter is extremely important because it affects the amplitude ratios\nof the components of a multiplet of non-radial modes and it is\nstrongly connected to the rotational splitting (see, for example,\nBallot et al. 2008, and references therein).\n\n5.

In red the spectrum\nof the 52 intermediate days of data, and in green the spectrum of\nthe last 52 days.\n\nTo find the region where the p modes are centered, we computed\nthe Power Spectrum of the Power Spectrum (PSPS) (or the autocorrelation of the PSD) in the region determined by the scaling\nlaws (see Fig 7 and a more detailed explanation in Sect 7.2).\nThis revealed a strong peak at half the large separation, \u2206\u03bd/2,\nwith the location of the peak implying \u2206\u03bd \u223c 87 \u03bcHz, which\nis close to the upper limit of the value estimated in Section 2,\nusing existing, non-seismic data on the star.

Power Spectrum of the Power Spectrum (PSPS) normalized by its standard deviation in the region between 1400\nand 2100 \u03bcHz. The highest peak corresponds to 6.35 hours, i.e.\n\u2206\u03bd=87.5 \u00b1 2.6 \u03bcHz.\ndown the range more carefully, we then performed the following\nprocedure.\nWe moved a 300-\u03bcHz-wide window through the frequency\nrange of interest, and computed the PSPS at each location. The\nwindow was shifted in steps of 33 \u03bcHz. We measured in each\nPSPS the height of the peak at \u2206\u03bd/2 relative to the local background level. The noise distribution in each PSPS will follow \u03c72\ntwo-degrees-of-freedom statistics; given this known distribution,\nit is possible to calculate a false-alarm probability for the \u2206\u03bd/2\npeak to appear by chance (as part of the background) anywhere\nin the PSPS. We calculated the level corresponding to a 5% of\nprobability of appearing by chance (Chaplin et al. 2002).\nThe maximum relative height of the \u2206\u03bd/2 peak (i.e., the\nheight divided by the measured background in the PSPS) is plotted in Fig. 8. We find here that the p-mode power is prominent\nbetween 1400 and 2100 \u03bcHz.\n\nFig. 8. Maximum of the PSPS in a region around the expected half-large separation computed in 300 \u03bcHz-wide windows shifted every 33 \u03bcHz. The horizontal error bars show the\nrange in frequency in the PS that was analyzed (300 \u03bcHz). The\ndashed line represents the 95% confidence level.\n\nThere are two power-law components in the summation: a\ncomponent to represent the significant power at very low frequencies from surface activity; and a component to represent\npower from surface granulation. Both power-law components\nare modelled in terms of three parameters: a power spectral density, A; a characteristic timescale, B; and a power-law index, C.\nThe third component in Equation 5, D, models the contribution\nfrom shot noise.\nRather than fit the raw power spectrum, we fitted a smoothed\nspectrum generated by applying an Ns -bin-wide boxcar, taking\nthe independent averages only. With Ns >\n\u223c 30, independent Ns bin averages show normally-distributed scatter about the (underlying) limit spectrum we seek to estimate from the fit. A standard\nleast-squares fitting was therefore applied, with weights fixed by\nthe uncertainties on each independent\n\u221a Ns -bin average. These uncertainties were each given by s/ Ns , where s is the standard\ndeviation of the Ns contributing power values.\nThe alternative approach is to fit the raw spectrum by maximizing a likelihood function commensurate with the \u03c72 twodegrees-of-freedom statistics. It turns out that the smoothed\nspectrum may also be fitted by applying the same maximum likelihood estimator (as was shown by (Appourchaux 2004)). These\napproaches are, however, more sensitive to the choice of initial\nfirst-guess parameters than is the least-squares fitting approach\napplied here, and can as such be prone to poor convergence.\nThere are a total of seven free parameters defining the background model in Equation 5. We did not, however, fit them all\nsimultanously: some parameters were fixed, as we now go on to\nexplain.\nWe assumed power in the very low-frequency activity component arises predominantly from the exponential decay of active regions and plage. This decay implies a limiting power density spectrum that is Lorentzian, hence we fixed the activitycomponent index to a value C1 = 2 during fitting.\nExercises performed with the asteroFLAG artificial asteroseismology data (Chaplin et al. 2008) showed that attempts to fit\nA1 and B1 simultaneously with the other parameters could lead\nto instability in the procedure and poor convergence. We found\nthat we could stabilize the fitting by fixing A1 at the value of the\npower spectral density of the first element of the averaged spectrum, leaving B1 as the only parameter of the activity component\nto be fitted. This approach does mean that some care is needed\nin interpreting the best-fitting value of B1 , since the value for\nA1 can be affected by the appearence in the power spectrum of\nnarrow-band features arising from rotational modulation, which\nare not modelled in Equation 5. The aforementioned approach to\nthe fitting does however give a good representation of the power\nfrom the active-region decay that leaks into the frequency region\nwhere the granulation is important; which in turn means we can\nin principle have more confidence in the accuracy of the bestfitting granulation parameters.\n\n7.

The blue curve in both\npanels is the PSD but smoothed using a boxcar of 5000 points.\n\nis observed, relative to the best-fitting background model (green\ncurve), in the region where the p-mode excess was detected (see\nSect. 5). To visually enhance the excess we also show in blue a\nheavily smoothed spectrum computed by applying a 5000-point\nboxcar (\u223c 370 \u03bcHz) to the raw spectrum.\nFigure 10 shows the Echelle diagram (Grec et al. 1983) of\nthe 70-point-boxcar smoothed PSD. The diagram covers the frequency region from 792.5 to 3000 \u03bcHz, with each horizontal\nstrip covering 87.5 \u03bcHz of the spectrum (see Fig. 7). Two ridges\nappear in the diagram, corresponding to the odd and even modes.\nInspection of the diagram shows that it is not possible to discriminate visually between the two ridges, hence the angular-degree\ntagging is uncertain.\n7.1. Global amplitude\n\nThe procedure for measuring the mode amplitudes begins by\naveraging the power spectral density in independent frequency\nslices of q\u2206\u03bd, where q = 1 or 2, and \u2206\u03bd is the estimated large frequency spacing of the acoustic mode spectrum. The fitted background is then subtracted. The resulting residuals in power spec-\n\ntral density will be greater than zero over ranges occupied by\nsignificant mode power.\nRe-calibration of the residual averages then allows for an estimate of the equivalent l = 0 mode amplitudes (Kjeldsen et al.\n2008). To re-calibrate, one must: (i) multiply by q\u2206\u03bd, to give the\naverage power across frequency intervals of this length; and (ii)\nnormalize to power per l = 0 mode, by dividing by qVtot , where\nVtot is the combined visibility of the l = 0, 1, 2 and 3 modes\n(again, see Kjeldsen et al. (2008)).\nIn practice we ran a boxcar of width q\u2206\u03bd through the spectrum in order to better estimate the maximum power (one could\nmiss the true maximum if the independent slices cut through\npairs of modes). The measured maximum mode rms amplitude\nwas Amax = 2.9 \u00b1 0.3 ppm.\nWe also applied a different approach to estimation of the amplitudes. This approach assumed the envelope of excess power\ndue to the modes could be modelled by a Gaussian function. We\nfitted a Gaussian profile to the re-calibrated residual averages\n(see above), and from the best-fitting maximum we estimated\nAmax = 2.8 \u00b1 0.1 ppm. The location in frequency of maximum\nalso allowed us to estimate the frequency of maximum power,\nwhich was \u03bdmax = 1912 \u00b1 47 \u03bcHz.\nTo convert these instrumental values into maximum intrinsic\nbolometric amplitudes per radial mode, Abol (l = 0), we took into\naccount the instrumental response functions for CoRoT, as presented by (Michel et al. 2009). We then found that Abol (l = 0)\n= 3.26 \u00b1 0.42 ppm (Michel et al. 2008a). This amplitude is\nabout one third smaller than the expected value deduced from\nthe scaling laws. Such a deficit is also seen for the other hot,\nsolar-like oscillators observed by CoRoT (Michel et al. 2008a).\nHD 181906 is not significantly undermetallic, so it is hard to\nappeal to a metallicity effect as a possible explanation (e.g., as\nin Mosser et al. (2008)). However, we note that this star \u2013 like\nthe other solar-like CoRoT targets HD 49933, HD 175726, and\nHD 181420 \u2013 rotates significantly faster than the Sun (10 times\nfor this target) and exhibits clear magnetic activity (cf. Sect. 4).\nIt could be an indication that the magnetic activity plays a role\nin suppressing the p-mode amplitudes by changing the surface\nconvection and thus modifying the efficiency of p-mode excitation processes. Some 3D compressible radiative magnetohy-\n\n\fGarc\u0131\u0301a et al.: HD 181906\n\n7.2. The mean large separation\n\nDifferent methods have been used for extracting the large separation of the p-mode spectrum. A good signature of this large\nseparation can be derived from the PSPS, or from the autocorrelation of the power spectrum, computed in the region where the\nexcess of power has been detected (see Fig. 9).\nTaking the frequency interval where the p-mode excess has\nbeen found (see Sect. 5), i.e. from 1400 to 2100 \u03bcHz, we find\nthat the PSPS is dominated by a peak at 6.35 hours (see Fig. 7),\nwhich corresponds to half the large separation of 43.75 \u03bcHz.\nIndeed, the main periodicity we found is not the large separation itself but the distance between peaks of even and odd degree. Therefore, the large separation is \u2206\u03bd = 87.5 \u00b1 2.6 \u03bcHz (see\nFig. 7). Depending on the range in frequency used to look for\nthe large separation, different groups have found slightly different values. For example, if we reduce the search range to 1400\nto 2000 \u03bcHz, the large separation is reduced to a value of 85.7 \u00b1\n2.6 \u03bcHz.\nAnother powerful way to estimate the value of the large separation is to build the so-called collapsogram (Korzennik 2008).\nThe first step consists in calculating all the Echelle diagrams for\na frequency range in which we expect the large separation (e.g.\n60-100 \u03bcHz). The second step then consists in collapsing the\nvertical dimension of each Echelle diagram. In the last step the\ncollapsed diagrams are stacked vertically, to yield the final collapsogram.\nThe collapsogram presents two advantages. First, it allows\nus to explore on a single diagram a wide range of possible values of the large separation. Secondly, it increases the visibility of\nthe separation compared to that seen in the Echelle diagram (although it does rely on the separation being almost uniform over\nthe frequency range used to construct the collapsogram).\nIn Fig. 11, we present the collapsogram of the smoothed\npower spectrum obtained with a weighted moving average over\n11 bins. The presence of the two mode ridges is seen, with the\nlarge separation indicated as being between 85 to 90 \u03bcHz. Note\nthat we have considered only the power spectrum in the frequency range between 1300 and 2300 \u03bcHz to build the collapsogram.\n7.3. Comparison with other observed F stars\n\nA comparison of published global parameters (and their associated error bars when available) from different F stars is presented in Table 3 where \u2206\u03bd is the large spacing, \u03bdmax is the frequency in the spectrum with the maximum power and Amax is\nthe bolometric maximum amplitude per radial mode. In the case\nof Procyon, the bolometric amplitude is obtained from the velocity measurements following Arentoft et al. (2008). The stars\nHD 181906, HD 49933, HD 181420 and HD 175726 are observed by CoRoT. However, the length of observations is not the\nsame for all of them, being 156 days for HD 181906 (the star\n\n100\n\n95\nLarge separation !\" (\u03bcHz)\n\ndrodynamics simulations (Jacoutot et al. 2008) have shown such\neffects.\nThere is another possibility, which is that the discrepancy\ncould be explained by a blending effect. Bruntt (2009) have\nshown evidence in the spectrum of HD 181906 for the superimposition of a second spectrum, which could be a companion\nor a star in the background field. If this is the case, the relative\namplitudes of modes could easily be underestimated by a factor\nof 1.5, making them compatible with the observations.\n\n7\n\n90\n\n85\n\n80\n\n75\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n60\nFrequency (\u03bcHz)\n\n80\n\n100\n\nFig. 11.

The data from Procyon\ncorrespond to velocity measurements obtained during 26 days\nfor a multisite campaign involving 11 telescopes (Arentoft et al.\n2008).\nThe data in Table 3 are obtained mainly from the above\nmentioned papers, except the bolometric maximum amplitude\nper radial mode (Amax ) for the 3 first mentioned CoRoT stars\nthat were obtained from Michel et al. (2008a). For Procyon, the\nTe f f , v sin i, and [Fe/H] were obtained from Allende Prieto et al.\n(2002). The value of the maximum amplitude in the spectrum\nis a translation from cm/s to ppm done in Arentoft et al. (2008)\nby the authors, a value that agrees well with the one obtained by\nBruntt et al. (2005) using white-light photometric data from the\nWIRE satellite.\n\n8. Extracting individual p-mode characteristics\nAlthough fitting low-degree p-mode profiles in helioseismology\nand asteroseismology might appear very similar, the unknown\nstellar inclination angle makes the fitting of asteroseismic data\nmuch more difficult (see for example Appourchaux et al. (2008)\nfor the case of the star HD 49933 or Gizon & Solanki (2003)\nfor Monte-Carlo simulations with artificial p-mode profiles). It\nis not only the lower signal-to-noise ratio of the p-mode asteroseismic signal which makes the fitting difficult but also the high\ncorrelation between the inclination and the rotational splitting\n(Ballot et al. 2006, 2008). Because of that, the determination of\nthese two parameters can be rather poor and will consequently\naffect the determination of the other parameters (frequencies,\nwidths, heights...). Therefore, instead of fitting individually each\nmultiplet or pair of modes \u2013 as it is commonly done in helioseismology \u2013 we choose to perform a global fitting of all the\n\n\f8\n\nGarc\u0131\u0301a et al.: HD 181906\n\nTable 3.

By doing so, the\nsplitting and the inclination angle are better constrained, even\nthough HD 181906 is then modeled as a rigidly rotating star.\nEach multiplet is described by five parameters: the central frequencies of the modes l = 0, 1, 2, one line width (the same for\nall modes within a large separation), and one mode height. We\nassumed the same visibility ratio between angular degrees as the\nones used in full-disk helioseismology and the visibilities between m-components given by Gizon & Solanki (2003).\nEight teams performed a global fitting of the HD 181906\ndata, seven of them using a maximum likelihood minimization\nand one using a least square fitting over an averaged spectrum.\nAll the teams did the fits for both scenarios (A and B) depending\non the identification of the ridges as the odd or even modes.\nTwo teams decided to split the observations in four subseries\nand computed the Joint Power Statistics (JPS, see Appendix A\nfor a detailed explanation). The JPS is an alternative method that\ncontains the same underlying information as the average spectrum but with a different treatment of the noise. The rest of the\nteams worked on the full resolution power spectrum. The number of overtones fitted was 5, 7, 9 and 16 overtones. Different\nstrategies have also been followed by each team to obtain the\ninitial parameters for the fit. In particular, one team used the results from HD 49933 (Appourchaux et al. 2008) as a guideline\nsince their PSDs look very similar and HD 49933 has a much\nbetter signal-to-noise ratio. Figure 12 shows the superposition\nof the PSD of HD 181906 and the one of HD 49933 \u2013 properly scaled in amplitude \u2013 and shifted by 17 \u03bcHz. Thus, the\ninitial guesses were obtained directly from the fitted values of\nHD 49933. Another team repeated the fits 200 times for each\nscenario, adding scatter to the initial parameters in order to test\nthe robustness of the fits and identify any correlation between\nthe initial seed values and the fitted ones. As expected, the inclination angle was identified to be strongly correlated with the\ninitial seed angle.\nThe mode parameters were then extracted using different approaches based on the recipe developed by the Data Analysis\nTeam (DAT) and explained in Appourchaux et al. (2008).\nHowever, in order to have a more reliable characterization of\nthe p-mode signal, given the low signal-to-noise ratio of the observations, some more a-priori information needed to be introduced. In order to stabilize the fits and avoid systematic outliers,\nsome of the fitting teams fixed some parameters to be equal over\nthe range of considered overtones. For instance, without some\na-priori conditions, the minimization procedures failed to return reliable estimates at high frequency, fitting mostly spikes\nand over-estimated heights.

The\nonly condition applied to those fits is that the mode widths and\nmode heights were set to be uniform (the same for all the modes)\nover the fitted frequency range. In the central part of the p-mode\nhump, those frequency estimates are consistent within 3\u03c3 with\nthe estimates returned using more constrained fits and different\ndataset lengths. In the low- and high-frequency ranges, the discrepancies are larger but still within 5\u03c3. Unfortunately, neither\nof the scenarios seems to be favoured: for instance, the likelihood ratio test does not allow us to disentangle between the two\npossibilities, the likelihood ratio being not greater than 5 (for the\nfits presented here).\nTable 4.

On one hand, the fitted inclination angle, for both\nscenarios (around 47o \u00b1 3.5o ) , is very close to the one derived\nfrom the analysis of the low-frequency peak of the PSD (see\nSect. 4) when a (v sin i)obs \u2248 16\u00b11 km s\u22121 is considered but quite\nfar from the \u223c 24o obtained considering (v sin i)obs \u2248 10 km s\u22121 .\nOn the other hand, the extracted rotational splitting (5.8 and 6.1\n\u00b1 0.14 \u03bcHz respectively for A and B scenarios) is overestimated\ncompared to the surface rotation rate (see Sect. 4). This could be\ndue to an increase of the rotation rate in the stellar interior or a\nbiased estimation due to the a-priori conditions applied to the fit\n(a common height and width for all the fitted modes).These results show, once again, the strong correlation between these two\nparameters and the necessity to have an external good determination of the inclination angle or the rotation of the star to be\nable to disentangle between the possible solutions.\nAnother parameter \u2013 the global line width \u2013 was found to\nbe rather small (1.25 -0.3/+0.4 and 1.28 -04/+0.6 \u03bcHz for scenarios A and B respectively), which is probably a consequence\nof the low SNR that could bias this estimate when we apply\nour peak-bagging codes: the low SNR means the modes will\nappear \"spikier\" than they really are (we lose the Lorentzian\ntails in the background noise), meaning we will be biased to fitting small line widths. We expect that the autocorrelation of the\npower spectrum will have better SNR than that seen in individual\nmodes and hence we look there for the features associated with\nmode line width. The features in it are quite wide, implying that\nthe line widths are large and probably in line with what we saw\nfor HD 49933 (see Fig. 12). Indeed, the widths of the modes in\nboth stars, around the maximum of the p-mode spectrum, seem\nto be similar which favours shorter mode lifetimes than in the\nSun.\nFinally, we would like to emphasize that the combination of\na small SNR, a possible small inclination angle of the star (close\nto 25\u25e6 ) and large mode line widths produce similar Lorentzian\nprofiles for the modes l=0, 2 and 1 (Ballot et al. 2004). This\neffect could contribute to explaining why we obtain very similar\nfitting results in both scenarios. More work will be necessary to\nobtain more reliable individual p-mode parameters.\n\n9. Conclusion and perspectives\nIn this paper we have shown the first seismic analysis of\nHD 181906 (HIP 95221), a faint CoRoT target (mv =7.65) that\nhas been observed continuously during 156.6 days in 2007. The\nsurface rotation of the star has been inferred by analyzing the\nvery low-frequency part of the power spectrum. A rotation rate\nof 2.9 days (4 \u03bcHz) has been established. The presence of a second peak close to the previous one in the power spectrum and\nproduced during a different period of time, has been interpreted\nas the signature of the presence of magnetic structures on the\n\n9\n\nstellar surface at different latitudes and, therefore, it has been\ndeduced that this star could have a slightly higher differential rotation than the Sun. Coupling this rotation rate with the previous\nresult of the (v sin i)obs \u2248 16 \u00b1 1 km s\u22121 has allowed us to infer an\ninclination angle of 37.5o \u00b1 4.5o but this value could be reduced\nto 24o \u00b1 3o if we consider that HD 181906 has a companion\nwhich implies a reduction in the (v sin i)obs to 10 \u00b11 km s\u22121 .\nA comb-like structure has been unveiled between 1400 and\n2100 \u03bcHz which corresponds to the acoustic-mode spectrum\nwith a maximum power at 1912 \u00b1 47 \u03bcHz and a large separation of 87.5 \u00b1 2.6 \u03bcHz measured inside this frequency interval.\nHowever, the low signal-to-noise ratio of the modes prevents us\nfrom unambiguously identifying them. To go further, more apriori information is needed to constrain the fits.\nAcknowledgements.

This\nhas often been accomplished by calculating either the arithmetic\nor geometric mean of a set of power spectra obtained from independent contiguous subsets of the complete time series. The\nexpected statistics of these averaged power spectra can be calculated, however they do not have the same negative exponential\ndistribution as a single power spectrum. The standard maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) fitting techniques are designed for\npower spectra with negative exponential statistics (i.e. \u03c72 with\n2 d.o.f.), it is therefore desirable to calculate an averaged power\nspectrum with the same statistics as the original spectrum.\nThe joint power statistic (JPS) (Sturrock et al. 2005) esembles a correlation function in the sense that it increases the contribution of signals present in a number of independent power\nspectra while decreasing the uncorrelated noise. It also has the\nimportant property that the JPS is distributed with negative exponential statistics and can, therefore, be immediately fitted using\nestablished MLE techniques. The JPS can be calculated using\nthe power spectra of any number of independent subseries, with\nthe resolution in frequency decreasing by a proportional amount\ncompared with the power spectrum of the complete time series.\nIn the case of HD 181906, the best compromise between increasing the amplitude-to-background ratio and maintaining sufficient\nresolution in frequency was found when the complete detrended\ntime series was divided into four contiguous subseries. The appropriate fourth order JPS can be approximated by\nJ4A =\n\n3.881X 2\n,\n1.269 + X\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere X is the geometric mean of the power spectra (S i ) calculated from four independent subseries\nX = (S 1 S 2 S 3 S 4 )1/4 .\n\n(A.2)\n\nIn the JPS calculated from four subseries, after smoothing with a Gaussian filter of width 1\u03c3=2 \u03bcHz, the average\namplitude-to-background ratio for mode peaks between 1700\nand 2000 \u03bcHz is 2.8. This compares with the equivalent full series smoothed FFT amplitude-to-background ratio of 1.7 over\nthe same range. While the JPS can be fitted assuming negative exponential statistics, the mode amplitudes obtained will be\nhigher than those obtained from a single power spectrum due to\nthe increase in power of correlated signals in the JPS. Similarly,\nthe stellar background parameters obtained from a JPS fit will be\nlower than those obtained from a power spectrum fit. The mode\nfrequencies and linewidths obtained from the JPS are the only\n\nparameters that are directly comparable with a fit to the power\nspectrum.\n\n\f"}
