The definition and main properties of the Ihara zeta function for\ngraphs are reviewed, focusing mainly on the case of periodic simple graphs.\nMoreover, we give a new proof of the associated determinant formula, based\non the treatment developed by Stark and Terras for finite graphs.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe zeta functions associated to finite graphs by Ihara [17], Hashimoto [12, 13],\nBass [2] and others, combine features of Riemann's zeta function, Artin L-functions,\nand Selberg's zeta function, and may be viewed as analogues of the Dedekind zeta\nfunctions of a number field. They are defined by an Euler product and have an\nanalytic continuation to a meromorphic function satisfying a functional equation.\nThey can be expressed as the determinant of a perturbation of the graph Laplacian\nand, for Ramanujan graphs, satisfy the Riemann hypothesis [26].\nThe first attempt in this context to study infinite graphs was made by Grigorchuk\nand \u017buk [9], who considered graphs obtained as a suitable limit of a sequence of\nfinite graphs. They proved that their definition does not depend on the approximating sequence in case of Cayley graphs of finitely generated residually finite groups,\nand, more generally, in case of graphs obtained as Schreier graphs of a pair (G, H)\nof a finitely generated group G and a separable subgroup H.\nThe definition of the zeta function was extended to (countable) periodic graphs\nby Clair and Mokhtari-Sharghi in [4], where the determinant formula has been\nproved. They deduce this result as a specialization of the treatment of group actions\non trees (the so-called theory of tree lattices, as developed by Bass, Lubotzky and\nothers, see [3]).\nThe purpose of this work is to give a more direct proof of that result, for the\ncase of periodic simple graphs with a free action. We hope that our treatment,\nbeing quite elementary, could be useful for someone seeking an introduction to the\nsubject. In a sequel to this paper [11], we shall prove that for periodic amenable\ngraphs, the Ihara zeta function can be approximated by the zeta functions of a\nDate: August 9, 2006.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05C25; 05C38; 46Lxx; 11M41.\nKey words and phrases.

Then, after\nhaving introduced some preliminary notions, we define in Section 4 the analogue\nof the Ihara zeta function, and show that it is a holomorphic function, while, in\nSection 6, we prove a corresponding determinant formula. The latter requires some\ncare, because it involves the definition and properties of a determinant for bounded\noperators (acting on an infinite dimensional Hilbert space and) belonging to a von\nNeumann algebra with a finite trace. This question is addressed in Section 5. In\nthe final section, we establish several functional equations.\nIn closing this introduction, we note that the operator-algebraic techniques used\nhere are introduced by the authors in [10] in order to study the Ihara zeta functions\nattached to a new class of infinite graphs, called self-similar fractal graphs.\n2. Zeta function for finite graphs\nThe Ihara zeta function is defined by means of equivalence classes of prime cycles.\nTherefore, we need to introduce some terminology from graph theory, following\n[24, 26] with some modifications.\nA graph X = (V X, EX) consists of a collection V X of objects, called vertices,\nand a collection EX of objects called (oriented) edges, together with two maps\ne \u2208 EX 7\u2192 (o(e), t(e)) \u2208 V X \u00d7 V X and e \u2208 EX 7\u2192 e \u2208 EX, satisfying the\nfollowing conditions: e = e, o(e) = t(e), \u2200e \u2208 EX. The vertex o(e) is called the\norigin of e, while t(e) is called the terminus of e. The couple {e, e} is called a\ngeometric edge. A graph is called simple if EX \u2282 {(u, v) \u2208 V X \u00d7 V X : u 6= v},\no(u, v) = u, t(u, v) = v, (u, v) = (v, u); therefore, the set of geometric edges can\nbe identified with a set of unordered pairs of distinct vertices. Observe that in the\nliterature what we have called graph is also called a multigraph, while a simple\ngraph is also called a graph. We will only deal with simple graphs. The edge\ne = {u, v} is said to join the vertices u, v, while u and v are said to be adjacent,\nwhich is denoted u \u223c v. A path (of length m) in X from v0 \u2208 V X to vm \u2208 V X, is\n(v0 , . . . , vm ), where vi \u2208 V X and vi+1 \u223c vi , for i = 0, ..., m \u2212 1. In the following,\nwe denote by |C| the length of a path C. A path is closed if vm = v0 . A graph is\nconnected if there is a path between any pair of distinct vertices.\nDefinition 2.1 (Proper closed Paths).\n(i) A path in X has backtracking if vi\u22121 = vi+1 , for some i \u2208 {1, . . . , m \u2212 1}. A path\nwith no backtracking is also called proper. Denote by C the set of proper closed\npaths.\n(ii) A proper closed path C = (v0 , . . . , vm = v0 ) has a tail if there is k \u2208 {1, . . . , [m/2]\u2212\n1} s.t. vj = vm\u2212j , for j = 1, . . . , k. Denote by Ctail the set of proper closed paths\nwith tail, and by Cnotail the set of proper tail-less closed paths, also called reduced\nclosed paths. Observe that C = Ctail \u222a Cnotail , Ctail \u2229 Cnotail = \u2205.\n(iii) A reduced closed path is primitive if it is not obtained by going n \u2265 2 times\naround some other closed path.\nExample 2.2. Some examples of non reduced closed paths are shown in figures 1,\n2.\nWe also need an equivalence relation for closed paths\n\n\fIHARA ZETA FUNCTION FOR PERIODIC SIMPLE GRAPHS\n\n3\n\nOrigin\n\nFigure 1. Closed path with backtracking\nOrigin\n\nFigure 2. Closed path with tail\nDefinition 2.3 (Cycles). Given closed paths C = (v0 , . . . , vm = v0 ), D = (w0 , . . . , wm =\nw0 ), we say that C and D are equivalent, and write C \u223co D, if there is k s.t.\nwj = vj+k , for all j, where the addition is taken mod m, that is, the origin of D is\nshifted k steps w.r.t. the origin of C. The equivalence class of C is denoted [C]o .\nAn equivalence class is also called a cycle. Therefore, a closed path is just a cycle\nwith a specified origin.\nDenote by R the set of reduced cycles, and by P \u2282 R the subset of primitive\nreduced cycles, also called prime cycles.\nThen Ihara [17] defined the zeta function of a finite graph, that is, a graph\nX = (V X, EX) with V X and EX finite sets, as\nDefinition 2.4 (Zeta function).\nZX (u) :=\n\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 u|C|)\u22121 ,\n\nC\u2208P\n\nu \u2208 C.\n\nIhara also proved the main result of this theory, though in the particular case of\nregular graphs; subsequently, through the efforts of Sunada [29], Hashimoto [12, 13]\nand Bass [2], that result was proved in full generality. Nowadays, there exist many\ndifferent proofs of Theorem 2.5, e.g. [26, 7, 18]. To state it, we need to introduce\nsome more notation. Let us denote by A = [A(v, w)], v, w \u2208 V X, the adjacency\nmatrix of X, that is,\n(\nA(v, w) =\n\n1\n0\n\n{v, w} \u2208 EX\notherwise.\n\n\f4\n\nDANIELE GUIDO, TOMMASO ISOLA, MICHEL L.

In closing this section, we mention a generalization of\nthe Ihara zeta function recently introduced by Bartholdi [1] and studied by Mizuno\nand Sato (see [20] and references therein).\n3. Periodic simple graphs\nLet X = (V X, EX) be a simple graph, which we assume to be (countable and)\nwith bounded degree, i.e. the degree of the vertices is uniformly bounded. Let\n\u0393 be a countable discrete subgroup of automorphisms of X, which acts freely on\nX (i.e. any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, \u03b3 6= id doesn't have fixed points), and with finite quotient\nB := X/\u0393. Denote by F \u2282 V X a set of representatives for V X/\u0393, the vertices\nof the quotient graph B. Let us define a unitary representation of \u0393 on l2 (V X)\nby (\u03bb(\u03b3)f )(x) := f (\u03b3 \u22121 x), for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, f \u2208 l2 (V X), x \u2208 V (X).

(i) if x = y then A2 (x, x) = 0 because there are no proper closed paths of\nlength 2 starting at x, whereas A2 (x, x) = deg(x) = (Q+I)(x, x), so that A2 (x, x) =\nA2 (x, x) \u2212 (Q + I)(x, x). If x 6= y, then A2 (x, y) is the number of paths of length 2\n2\n2\n(necessarily proper) from x to\nPy, so A2 (x, y) = A (x, y) = A (x, y) \u2212 (Q + I)(x, y).\n(ii) for x, y \u2208 V X, the sum z\u2208V X Am\u22121 (x, z)A(z, y) counts the proper paths of\nlength m from x to y, plus additional paths formed of a proper path of length\nm \u2212 2 from x to y followed by a path of length 2 from y to z and back; since\nthe path from x to y and then to z is a proper path of length m \u2212 1 (one of\nthose counted by Am\u22121 (x, z)), z can only be one of the deg(y) \u2212 1 = Q(y, y) vertices\nP adjacent to y, the last one being on the proper path from x to y. Therefore\nz\u2208V X Am\u22121 (x, z)A(z, y) = Am (x, y) + Am\u22122 (x, y)Q(y, y), and the statement follows.\n(iii) We have kA1 k = kAk \u2264 d, kA2 k \u2264 d2 + d, and kAm k \u2264 d(kAm\u22121 k + kAm\u22122 k,\nfrom which the claim follows by induction.\n\u0003\nDenote by Cm the subset of C consisting of the proper closed paths of length m,\nnotail\nand attach a similar meaning to Ctail\n, Rm and Pm .\nm , Cm\nP\nLemma 3.2.

A\npath C in the last set goes from x to y, then over a closed path D of length m \u2212 2,\nand then back to x. There are two kinds of closed paths D at y: those with tails\nand those without. If D has no tail, then there are Q(y, y) + 1 possibilities for x to\nbe adjacent to y, but x cannot be on D (otherwise, C would have backtracking),\nwhich leaves Q(y, y) \u2212 1 possibilities. If D has a tail, x cannot be on D (otherwise,\nC would have backtracking), which leaves Q(y, y) possibilities.

Given C, D \u2208 R,\nwe say that C and D are \u0393-equivalent, and write C \u223c\u0393 D, if there is an isomorphism\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 s.t. D = \u03b3(C). We denote by [R]\u0393 the set of \u0393-equivalence classes of reduced\ncycles, and analogously for the subset P.\nFor the purposes of the next result, for any closed path D = (v0 , . . . , vm = v0 ),\nwe also denote vj by vj (D).\nLet us now assume that C is a prime cycle of length m. Then the stabilizer of\nC in \u0393 is the subgroup \u0393C = {\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393 : \u03b3(C) = C} or, equivalently, \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393C if there\nexists p(\u03b3) \u2208 Zm s.t., for any choice of the origin of C, vj (\u03b3C) = vj\u2212p (C), for any\nj. Let us observe that p(\u03b3) is a group homomorphism from \u0393C to Zm , which is\ninjective because \u0393 acts freely.

(i) Let us assume that [C]\u0393 is an equivalence class of prime cycles in [Pm ]\u0393 ,\nand consider the set U of all primitive closed paths with the origin in F and representing [C]\u0393 . If C is such a representative, any other representative can be obtained in this way: choose k \u2208 Zm , let \u03b3(k) be the (unique) element in \u0393 for which\n\u03b3(k)vk (C) \u2208 F, and define Ck as\nvj (Ck ) = \u03b3(k)vj+k (C), j \u2208 Zm .\nIf we want to count the elements of U , we should know how many of the elements\nCk above coincide with C. For this to happen, \u03b3 should clearly be in the stabilizer of the cycle [C]o . Conversely, for any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393C , there exists p = p(\u03b3) \u2208 Zm\nsuch that \u03b3vj (C) = vj\u2212p (C), therefore \u03b3 = \u03b3(p). As a consequence, vj (Cp(\u03b3) ) =\n\u03b3(p)vj+p (C) = vj (C), so that Cp(\u03b3) = C. We have proved that the cardinality of\nU is equal to \u03bd(C). The proof for a non-prime cycle is analogous.

An analytic determinant for von Neumann algebras with a finite\ntrace\nIn this section, we define a determinant for a suitable class of not necessarily\nnormal operators in a von Neumann algebra with a finite trace.

A cycle with |\u0393C | = 2\nIn a celebrated paper [8], Fuglede and Kadison defined a positive-valued determinant for finite factors (i.e. von Neumann algebras with trivial center and finite\ntrace). Such a determinant is defined on all invertible elements and enjoys the\nmain properties of a determinant function, but it is positive-valued. Indeed, for\nan invertible operator\n\u221a A with polar decomposition A = U H, where U is a unitary\noperator and H := A\u2217 A is a positive self-adjoint operator, the Fuglede\u2013Kadison\ndeterminant is defined by\nDet(A) = exp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 log H,\nwhere log H may be defined via the functional calculus.\nFor the purposes of the present paper, we need a determinant which is an analytic\nfunction. As we shall see, this can be achieved, but corresponds to a restriction\nof the domain of the determinant function and implies the loss of some important\nproperties. Let (A, \u03c4 ) be a von Neumann algebra endowed with a finite trace. Then,\na natural way to obtain an analytic function is to define, for A \u2208 A, det\u03c4 (A) =\nexp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 log A, where\nZ\n1\nlog(A) :=\nlog \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 A)\u22121 d\u03bb,\n2\u03c0i \u0393\nand \u0393 is the boundary of a connected, simply connected region \u03a9 containing the\nspectrum of A. Clearly, once the branch of the logarithm is chosen, the integral\nabove does not depend on \u0393, provided \u0393 is given as above.\n\n\f10\n\nDANIELE GUIDO, TOMMASO ISOLA, MICHEL L. LAPIDUS\n\nThen a na\u0131\u0308ve way of defining det is to allow all elements A for which there exists\nan \u03a9 as above, and a branch of the logarithm whose domain contains \u03a9. Indeed\nthe following holds.\nLemma 5.1. Let A, \u03a9, \u0393 be as above, and \u03c6, \u03c8 two branches of the logarithm such\nthat both domains contain \u03a9. Then\nexp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c6(A) = exp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c8(A).\nProof. The function \u03c6(\u03bb) \u2212 \u03c8(\u03bb) is continuous and everywhere defined on \u0393. Since\nit takes its values in 2\u03c0iZ, it should be constant on \u0393. Therefore\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n1\n2\u03c0in0 (\u03bb \u2212 A)\u22121 d\u03bb exp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c8(A)\nexp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c6(A) = exp \u25e6 \u03c4\n2\u03c0i \u0393\n= exp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6 \u03c8(A).\n\n\u0003\n\nThe problem with the previous definition\u0012is its\u0013dependence on the choice of\n1 0\n\u03a9. Indeed, it is easy to see that when A =\nand we choose \u03a9 containing\n0 i\n{ei\u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2]} and any suitable branch of the logarithm, we get det(A) = ei\u03c0/4 ,\nby using the normalized trace on 2 \u00d7 2 matrices. On the other hand, if we choose\n\u03a9 containing {ei\u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 [\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0]} and a corresponding branch of the logarithm, we\nget det(A) = e5i\u03c0/4 . Therefore, we make the following choice.\nDefinition 5.2. Let (A, \u03c4 ) be a von Neumann algebra endowed with a finite trace,\nand consider the subset A0 = {A \u2208 A : 0 6\u2208 conv \u03c3(A)}, where \u03c3(A) denotes the\nspectrum of A. For any A \u2208 A0 we set\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n1\ndet\u03c4 (A) = exp \u25e6 \u03c4 \u25e6\nlog \u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 A)\u22121 d\u03bb ,\n2\u03c0i \u0393\nwhere \u0393 is the boundary of a connected, simply connected region \u03a9 containing\nconv \u03c3(A), and log is a branch of the logarithm whose domain contains \u03a9.\nCorollary 5.3. The determinant function defined above is well-defined and analytic\non A0 .\nWe collect some properties of our determinant in the following result.\nProposition 5.4. Let (A, \u03c4 ) be a von Neumann algebra endowed with a finite trace,\nA \u2208 A0 . Then\n(i) det\u03c4 (zA) = z \u03c4 (I) det\u03c4 (A), for any z \u2208 C \\ {0},\n(ii) if A is normal, and A = U H is its polar decomposition,\ndet\u03c4 (A) = det\u03c4 (U )det\u03c4 (H),\n(iii) if A is positive, det\u03c4 (A) = Det(A), where the latter is the Fuglede-Kadison\ndeterminant.\nProof. (i) If the half-line {\u03c1ei\u03b80 \u2208 C : \u03c1 > 0} does not intersect conv \u03c3(A), then the\nhalf-line {\u03c1ei(\u03b80 +t) \u2208 C : \u03c1 > 0} does not intersect conv \u03c3(zA), where z = reit . If\nlog is the branch of the logarithm defined on the complement of the real negative\nhalf-line, then \u03c6(x) = i(\u03b80 \u2212 \u03c0) + log(e\u2212i(\u03b80 \u2212\u03c0) x) is suitable for defining det\u03c4 (A),\nwhile \u03c8(x) = i(\u03b80 + t \u2212 \u03c0) + log(e\u2212i(\u03b80 +t\u2212\u03c0) x) is suitable for defining det\u03c4 (zA).\nMoreover, if \u0393 is the boundary of a connected, simply connected region \u03a9 containing\n\n\fIHARA ZETA FUNCTION FOR PERIODIC SIMPLE GRAPHS\n\n11\n\nconv \u03c3(A), then z\u0393 is the boundary of a connected, simply connected region z\u03a9\ncontaining conv \u03c3(zA).
