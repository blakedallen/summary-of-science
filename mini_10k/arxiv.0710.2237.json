A wealth of observations of CO in absorption in diffuse clouds has accumulated in the past decade at uv and mm-wavelengths\nAims. Our aims are threefold: a) To compare the uv and mm-wave results; b) to interpret 13 CO and 12 CO abundances in terms of the physical\nprocesses which separately and jointly determine them; c) to interpret observed J=1-0 rotational excitation and line brightness in terms of\nambient gas properties.\nMethods. A simple phenomenological model of CO formation as the immediate descendant of quiescently-recombining HCO+ is used to study\nthe accumulation, fractionation and rotational excitation of CO in more explicit and detailed models of H2 -bearing diffuse/H I clouds\nResults. The variation of N(CO) with N(H2 ) is explained by quiescent recombination of a steady fraction n(HCO+ )/n(H2 ) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 . Observed\nN(12 CO))/N(13 CO) ratios generally do not require a special chemistry but result from competing processes and do not provide much insight into\nthe local gas properties, especially the temperature. J=1-0 CO line brightnesses directly represent N(CO), not N(H2 ), so the CO-H2 conversion\n16\n\u22122\nfactor varies widely; it attains typical values at N(12 CO) <\n\u223c 10 cm . Models of CO rotational excitation account for the line brightnesses\nand CO-H2 conversion factors but readily reproduce the observed excitation temperatures and optical depths of the rotational transitions only if\nexcitation by H-atoms is weak \u2013 as seems to be the case for the very most recent calculations of these excitation rates.\nConclusions. Mm-wave and uv results generally agree well but the former show somewhat more enhancement of 13 C in 13 CO. In any case,\nfractionation may seriously bias 12 C/13 C ratios measured in CO and other co-spatial molecules. Complete C\u2192CO conversion must occur over a\nvery narrow range of AV and N(H2 ) just beyond the diffuse regime. For N(H2 ) < 7 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 the character of the chemistry changes inasmuch\nas CH is generally undetected while CO suffers no such break.\nKey words. interstellar medium \u2013 molecules\n\n1. Introduction.\nExcept for hydrogen, carbon monoxide is the most important and widely observed molecule in the interstellar medium\n(ISM). The 7-8 decade span in column density over which CO\nis directly observed, from N(CO) = 1012 cm\u22122 in uv absorption in the diffuse interstellar medium to N(CO) > 1019 cm\u22122\nin mm and sub-mm emission from dense and giant molecular\nclouds, is exceeded only by that of H2 itself. The ubiquity of\nCO has encouraged the use of mm-wave CO emission as a possible tracer of molecular hydrogen even into such extreme environments as high velocity clouds (Dessauges-Zavadsky et al.,\n2007) .\nInterpreting observations of CO in diffuse gas\n(Snow & McCall, 2006) over the lower half of its range,\n16\n\u22122\nat N(CO) <\n\u223c 10 cm , has been particularly challenging.\nThe fraction of free gas-phase carbon in CO is small, a\nfew percent or less when, locally, AV < 1 mag, but it is still\n30-50 times larger than can be explained by the quiescent\nSend offprint requests to: H.

The relative abundance of CO with respect to H2\nvaries widely in this regime (see Fig. 1; with much scatter,\napproximately as N(CO) \u221d N(H2 )2 over the range X(CO) =\nN(CO)/N(H2 ) \u2248 3 \u00d7 10\u22128 \u2212 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 ) and the relative abundances of 12 CO and 13 CO are strongly affected by fractionation\n(Watson et al., 1976; Smith & Adams, 1980) such that 20 <\n\u223c\nN(12 CO)/N(13 CO) <\n\u223c 170 (see the references cited in Sect. 2)\nDespite the comparatively small CO abundances in diffuse\nclouds, \u03bb 2.6mm J=1-0 rotational emission is often appreciable. Typically it is seen that TB \u2248 1\u22125 K, WCO \u2248 1\u22125 K km s\u22121\npeak or integrated brightness for N(CO) = 1015 \u2212 1016 cm\u22122\n(Liszt & Lucas, 1998) but peak brightnesses as high as 10-13 K\nhave been observed Liszt & Lucas (1994). Moreover, the J=1-0\nrotational transition may have appreciable optical depth in diffuse gas because its excitation is quite weak. Surveys of 12 CO\nalone may be hard-pressed to distinguish between dark and diffuse gas, especially at higher galactic latititude or larger galactocentric radii owing to the broader distribution of diffuse gas.\n\n\fH. S. Liszt: Formation, fractionation and excitation of carbon monoxide in diffuse clouds\n\nTo elucidate the properties of CO in the diffuse regime,\nwe discuss here a wealth of observational material at uv and\nmm-wavlengths which has accumulated (much of it very recently) over the past decade. The plan of this work is as\nfollows. Section 2 gathers the previously-published observational results (Liszt & Lucas, 1998; Sonnentrucker et al., 2007;\nBurgh et al., 2007; Sheffer et al., 2007) which form the basis\nof the present discussion. Section 3 displays and discusses the\nrun of observed values of the CO and H2 column densities to\ndemonstrate that there is at least a phenomenological basis for\nunderstanding the abundance of CO in diffuse gas, in order to\nshow that there is some knowledge of the microscopic CO formation rate. This rate and those of the various other physical\nprocesses which account for the abundances of 12 CO and 13 CO\nare set out in detail in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the observed\nabundances of 12 CO and 13 CO and their fractionation, and Sect.\n6 discusses the rotational excitation and brightness of the J=10 rotational transition. Section 7 is a brief discussion and summary of outstanding concerns.\n\n128\n64\n\n1016\n16\n16\n\nN(CO) [cm-2]\n\n2\n\n+\nX(HCO )/2\n\n1015\n\n1014\n\n1013\n64\n\n1012\n\nradio\n\nWith one minor exception (see Sect. 6) , the discussion here\nrelies on previously-published results in the uv and mmwavelength regimes, as we now discuss.\n\n2.1. uv and optical absorption\nMany determinations of N(CO) and N(H2 ) have recently been\npublished by Sonnentrucker et al. (2007), Burgh et al. (2007)\nand Sheffer et al. (2007), who provide measurements of N(H2 ),\nN(12 CO) and N(13 CO), along with such additional physically\ninteresting quantities as the J=1-0 rotational temperatures of H2\nand/or carbon monoxide and, from Sonnentrucker et al. (2007),\ncolumn densities and related quantities for such species as CH\nand C2 . For the lines of sight where there is overlap, agreement is generally excellent for the column densities of CO\nand H2 and only slightly worse for the CO excitation temperature, as shown below in Figs. 5 and 6. In cases of overlap,\nwe chose values from the reference with the smaller quoted\nerrors if the datasets were equally comprehensive in that direction. However, we also chose not to mix values for N(12 CO)\nand N(13 CO) from different references along any given line of\nsight, because the systematic errors could be different.\n\n2.2. MM-wave absorption\nObservations of carbon monoxide in absorption toward mmwave continuum sources were given by Liszt & Lucas (1998),\nalong with rotational excitation temperatures and isotope ratios, etc.). N(H2 ) is not known directly in these measurements, which assume instead that N(H2 ) = N(HCO+ )/2 \u00d7 10\u22129\n(Liszt & Lucas, 1996; Lucas & Liszt, 1996, 2000). The current\ndiscussion may be regarded as a consistency check on this assumption.\nIn comparing the radio and optical lines of sight, it should\nbe remembered that the former use extragalactic background\n\nN(CH) [cm-2]\n\n2.

S. Liszt: Formation, fractionation and excitation of carbon monoxide in diffuse clouds\n\n3. Variation of molecular abundance with H2 and\nthe source function for carbon monoxide\nThe abundances of 12 CO and 13 CO are the result of several processes; chemical formation and destruction, carbon isotope exchange and (selective) photodissociation. Interpreting the observations requires an understanding of the competing influences of all such processes, but the overall guage is really set by\na comparison of the photodissociation rate (which is known in\nfree space and calculable within a model) and the direct chemical formation rate. Once the latter is specified, other physical\nproperties follow directly and it is even possible to model the\ninternal rotational excitation and predicted mm-wave brightness. Here we outline an empirical approach to estimating the\nrate of CO formation.\n\n3.1. CO and H2\nIn Fig. 1 at top we show the observed run of N(12 CO) with\nN(H2 ). The rise of N(CO) with increasing N(H2 ) is very steep,\napproximately N(CO) \u221d N(H2 )2 , with scatter amounting to two\norders of magnitude at fixed N(H2 ). At each N(H2 ) the radioderived N(CO) is comparatively but not inordinately large; this\ncould be an indication that X(HCO+ ), taken as 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 , has\nbeen slightly overestimated. The large subset of uv-absorption\ndatapoints which have CO excitation temperature measurements and which therefore appear also in Fig. 5 have been\nflagged and colored green in Fig. 1, in order to highlight the\nfact that most of them require model densities of at least n(H)\n= 64 cm\u22123 (see Sect. 6).\nWhat to make of the variation of N(CO) with N(H2 )?\nModels of CO formation employing thermal processes in quiescent diffuse gas have largely been unable to reproduce observed values of X(CO) except perhaps at rather higher densities than are otherwise inferred for diffuse gas; see Fig. 16 of\nSonnentrucker et al. (2007). However, purely phenomenologically, it is known that thermal gas-phase electron recombination of the observed amount of HCO+ , X(HCO+ ) \u2248 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 ,\ndoes suffice to reproduce the observed X(CO) at modest densities. This is shown by the curves at the top in Fig. 1, where,\nupdating the calculations of Liszt & Lucas (2000), we plot the\npredicted N(CO) for diffuse cloud models in which an artificially steady relative abundance X(HCO+ ) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 is allowed to recombine with free electrons at the thermal rate; note\nthat the mm-wave observations of N(CO) and N(HCO+ ) have\nbeen placed in the plane of the Figure by relying on the same\nX(HCO+ ) which in the models explains the CO abundance.\nThe models are for small uniform density spheres immersed in the mean galactic radiation fields, within which the\nthermal balance, ionization equilibrium and H2 and CO accumulation problems are solved self-consistently (Liszt, 2007)\nusing the self-shielding factors of Lee et al. (1996). For each\ntotal density n(H) = 16, 32, 64 ... 256 cm\u22123 , a series of models\nof increasing N(H) was calculated, and the CO and H2 column\ndensities across the central line of sight were calculated to form\nthe curves for each n(H).\nThe newer calculations differ from the older ones in a variety of small ways, for instance the rates for O I and C I ex-\n\n3\n\ncitation by hydrogen atoms were very recently recalculated by\nAbrahamsson et al. (2007). Most important is the recognition,\nfollowing observation of H3 + , and accounting for the neutralization rate on small grains/PAH, that that the low-level hard\nionization rate of hydrogen, presumably due to cosmic rays,\nis apparently larger in diffuse gas (McCall et al., 2002; Liszt,\n2003). This has the effect of increasing the densities of H+ and\nHe+ and the overall electron fraction (which, however, is never\nmore than about twice the free carbon abundance). Higher electron fractions lead to more rapid formation of CO (if CO forms\nby HCO+ recombination) while the increased density of He+\nplays an elevated role in the destruction of carbon monoxide.\nIndeed, destruction by He+ is the dominant chemical mechanism for 12 CO destruction. The various processes responsible\nfor destroying CO are discussed in Sect. 4.\nIn the Figure, scatter in N(CO) at fixed N(H2 ) is implicitly\nattributed to variations in density, which in the models ranges\nbetween n(H) = 16 cm\u22123 and 256 cm\u22123 . However, the very\nlowest curve shows the result of halving X(HCO+ ) in the model\nand additional observational scatter , perhaps substantial, could\nalso result from variations in geometry and ambient illumination. Consideration of fractionation strongly suggests variations of a factor two or more in the photodissociation rate (see\nSect. 5 and Fig. 4).\nIn the remainder of this work we will assume that the direct\nCO formation rate is adequately specified by the dissociative\nrecombination of HCO+ at X(HCO+ ) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 and we will\nemploy this as a basis to interpret the observed fractionation\nand rotational excitation in a self-consistent fashion (interpreting brightness, etc. within the context of a model which also\naccounts for the abundance). The following Section sets out in\ndetail the physical processes which determine the abundances\nof 12 CO and 13 CO.\n\n3.2. CO, CH and H2\nBy contrast with CO, the variation of N(CH) with N(H2 ) is very\nnearly linear and with considerably smaller scatter and overall range for the actually-measured N(CH). Fig. 1 at bottom is\nan updated version of Fig. 1 of Liszt & Lucas (2002) and although it shows a somewhat less-perfect correlation in a larger\ndataset (46 vs 32 sightlines), the derived means < N(CH) > / <\nN(H2 ) >= 4.1 \u00d7 10\u22128 and < N(CH)/N(H2 ) >= 4.5 \u00b1 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22128\n(for lines of sight with CH detections at N(H2 ) \u2265 7\u00d71019 cm\u22122 )\nare nearly unchanged, N(CH) and N(CO) are well-correlated\n(coefficient 0.86; this is somewhat contrary to a remark by\nCrenny & Federman (2004)) though the functional relationship\nis quite steep, N(CO) \u221d N(CH)2.6 .\nIn general, for N(CH) > 2\u00d71012 cm\u22122 , CH is a quite reliable\nindicator of the H2 column density, with N(H2 ) \u2248 N(CH)/4 \u00d7\n10\u22128 . However, and somewhat remarkably, for N(H2 ) < 7 \u00d7\n1019 cm\u22122 it is somewhat more likely to find CO than CH,\nand several lines of sight at lower N(H2 ) have very high values\nof N(CO)/N(CH) (see Fig. 18 in Sonnentrucker et al. (2007)).\nLines of sight with low molecular abundances, including a few\nof those with smaller or undetected N(CH) in Fig. 1 were discussed by Zsarg\u00f3 & Federman (2003), who argued that non-\n\n\f4\n\nH.

The carbon isotope exchange reactions also\ninvolve C+ and it is of interest to ask whether they also must be\ndriven at non-thermal rates in order to account for the observed\nN(12 CO)/N(13 CO) ratios.\nThe rate constant for thermal recombination of HCO+ with\nelectrons is 3.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 cm3 s\u22121 /TK according to the UMIST\nreaction rate database (Woodall et al., 2007); therefore the volume formation rate of 12 CO due to recombination of H12 CO+\nin a gas having an electron fraction X(e)= n(e)/n(H2) is\n\nX(12CO)\n\n10-5\n\n10-6\n\ndn(12 CO)/dt = 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221214 X(e)n(H2 )2 cm\u22123 s\u22121 /TK\n10-7\n\nand the formation rate of 13 CO due to recombination of\nH CO+ is here taken to be 60 times smaller following our\nisotope measurements in mm-wave absorption (Lucas & Liszt,\n1998).\n13\n\nradio\n12C&13C\n\n10-8 19\n10\n\n1020\nN(H2) [cm-2]\n\n1021\n\nFig. 2.

Alternatively we\nnoted that very high values for X(OH) = N(OH)/N(H2 ) might\nbe expected in more diffuse H2 -bearing gas just from quiescent\nthermal processes (Liszt, 2007); if CO is formed from OH, high\nN(CO)/N(CH) ratios might also be explained in this way.\n\n4. Mechanisms of CO formation and fractionation\nIn this Section we set out the various physical processes contributing to the formation, destruction and fractionation of carbon monoxide, albeit in a very reductive fashion. The ambient\ngas is taken to be diffuse but purely molecular and the molecular abundances are taken to small enough that conservation of\nnuclei need not be explictly observed; that is, the fraction of C\nin CO is not large enough to affect the relative abundance of\nHCO+ and the fraction of 13 C in 13 CO is not large enough to\nalter the relative rates at which 12 CO and 13 CO form from the\nisotopic variants of HCO+ .\n\n4.1. Source function for carbon monoxide formation\nAs noted above, a source function for carbon monoxide may\nbe approximated as the quiescent thermal recombination rate\nof a fixed relative abundance X(HCO+ ) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 such that\nthe observations are explained at densities typical of diffuse\nclouds, even if the exact formation route for HCO+ in diffuse\ngas is problematical. Ion-molecule reactions in such a quiescent gas form too little HCO+ and/or CO by a factor of about\n30 and to account for the discrepancy it has been suggested\nthat chemical reactions with C+ are driven at higher rates for\n\n4.2. Carbon isotope exchange\n12\n\nCO molecules are interconverted to 13 CO with a rate constant\nkf by the reaction 13 C+ + 12 CO \u2192 12 C+ + 13 CO + 34.8 K, and in\nthe other direction at rate kr = kf exp(-34.8/TK) (Watson et al.,\n1976). The rate constants were measured by Smith & Adams\n(1980) and shown to be strongly temperature-dependent below\n500 K with a measured value kf = 7 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 at TK = 80\nK, (and an implied value 70% larger at 10 K), as compared with\nkf = 2\u00d710\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 measured at TK = 300 K by Watson et al.\n(1976). Smith & Adams (1980) discuss the means by which to\nconvert their measurements to values of kf below 80 K and their\nresults have been employed by most subsequent authors, for instance Chu & Watson (1983) or Langer et al. (1984) (although\nnot by Sheffer et al. (2007) who used the much smaller value\nof Watson et al. (1976), claiming that it agreed better with observation).\nA suitable expression for kf (TK ) based on the results of\nSmith & Adams (1980) does not exist in the literature. For future reference, we provide the following:\nkf = 7.64 \u00d7 10\u22129 TK \u22120.55 cm3 s\u22121 (TK = 80 \u2212 500K)\n\n(4a)\n\n1.39 \u00d7 10\u22129 TK \u22120.05 cm3 s\u22121\n(TK = 10 \u2212 80K) (4b)\n1 + exp (\u221234.8/TK)\nIn terms of volume formation rates, the forward reaction\nforming 13 CO proceeds at a volume rate\nkf =\n\ndn(13 CO)/dt = kf X(12 CO) X(13 C+ ) n(H2 )2 cm\u22123 s\u22121\nIt is straightforward to show that the backward reaction\nbetween 12 C+ and 13 CO is never an important \"source\" of\n12\nCO (given the rate at which 12 CO putatively forms from\n12\nH CO+ ) but conversion of 12 CO to 13 CO is the dominant\nroute to 13 CO formation when the relative abundance X(12 CO)\nsubstantially exceeds 10\u22126 . The 13 C-insertion reaction would\ndominate at much smaller X(12 CO) if the direct formation\nrates were slower, leading to problems making models with\nX(12 CO)/X(13 CO) >> 60, as in Fig. 16 of Warin et al.

Relative abundances of 12 CO and 13 CO\n\nThe reaction He+ + CO \u2192 C+ + O + He proceeds with a\nrate constant kHe = 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121 and is the dominant\nchemical destruction mechanism for 12 CO whenever n(H2 )\n< 100 cm\u22123 . 1 he same is not true for 13 CO, whose chemical\ndestruction is generally dominated by 12 C-insertion whenever\nn(H2 ) > 2 cm\u22123 , see Eq. 4c and 4d. Calculation of the ionization equilibrium is complicated, but diffuse cloud models\ntend to produce a nearly constant number density of He+ because such a large fraction of the free electrons arises from\nthe near-complete photoionization of carbon. From our models we take n(He+ ) = 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 which is appropriate\neither when neutralization by small grains is considered and \u03b6H\n= 2 \u00d7 10\u221216 s\u22121 per H-nucleon or when neutralization by small\ngrains is ignored and \u03b6H = 10\u221217 s\u22121 (Liszt, 2003).\nThe volume destruction rate of 12 CO by He+ is\n12\ndn( CO)/dt = \u2212kHe n(He)+ n(12 CO) cm\u22123 s\u22121 or, numerically\n\nGiven the preceding considerations in this Section we may\nwrite the following approximate, implicit and local expressions\nfor the relative abundances\n\ndn(12 CO)/dt = \u22125.4 \u00d7 10\u221213 X(12 CO) n(H2 ) cm\u22123 s\u22121\n\n4.4. Photodestruction and selective photodissociation\nThe nominal free-space photodissociation rate in the mean interstellar radiation field is usually taken to be the same for\neither version of CO and we parameterize the photodestruction rate internal to a cloud as 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 s\u22121 gY I where I\n<> 1 represents the possibility of a variable external radiation\nfield, 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221210 s\u22121 is the photodissociation rate in free space\n(Le Teuff et al., 2000) , and g12 or g13 represent the diminution\nof the photodestruction rate due to shielding by dust, H2 and\nother carbon monoxide molecules for either isotope. The freespace rates for 12 CO and 13 CO are taken equal but g12 declines\nmore rapidly into a cloud than does g13 (Van Dishoeck & Black\n(1988); Warin et al. (1996)). In Sect. 5 we show an example\nwhere this behaviour is parametrized as g13 = g0.6\n12 .\n1\n\nT\n\nX(12 CO) =\n\n1.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 X(e)\u2032 n(H2 )/TK\ng12 I + 0.0026 + 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 kf \u2032 n(H2 )\n\n(4c)\n\n(2.0 \u00d7 10\u22129 X(e)\u2032 /TK + 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22125 X(12 CO))n(H2)\ng13 I + 0.0026 + 0.0014kf \u2032 n(H2 ) exp (\u221234.8/TK)\n(4d)\nWhere kf \u2032 = kf /10\u22129 cm3 s\u22121 , I measures the strength\nof the incident interstellar radiation field normalized to its\nmean strength (I=1) and X(e)\u2032 = X(e)/4 \u00d7 10\u22124 ; the electron fraction is comprised of a contribution from fully onceionized atomic carbon at the level of 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 for an H2\ngas (Sofia et al., 2004), and the remainder from H+ due to\ncosmic-ray ionization (Liszt, 2003). The first term in the numerator of Eq. 4d corresponds to recombination of H13 CO+\nwith X(H12 CO+ )/X(H13 CO+ ) = 60 and the numerical constant\nin both denominators represents destruction by interaction with\nHe+ . In considering these expressions note that the hydrogen in\ndiffuse gas is not wholly molecular, probably even when CO is\ndetected, and the total density n(H) = n(H I) + 2 n(H2 ) = 2\nn(H2 )/fH2 where fH2 is the fraction of H-nuclei in H2 .\nNote the following with regard to these expressions. For\n12\nCO, photodestruction is dominant until g12 I \u2248 0.003, at\nwhich point the shielding would be strong enough to permit\nnear-complete conversion of carbon to CO. Thus this simple\nchemical scheme can carry the gas from the diffuse to the dark\nregime (where the free carbon abundance is somewhat lower\nand X(12 CO) \u2248 10\u22124 ). Also for 12 CO, destruction by conversion to 13 CO dominates over destruction by He+ only for n(H2 )\n> 100 cm\u22122 ; this stands in opposition to the situation for 13 CO,\nwhere the interaction with He+ is negligible at almost all densities. This imbalance contributes to the lack of equilibration of\nX(13 CO) =\n\n\f6\n\nH. S. Liszt: Formation, fractionation and excitation of carbon monoxide in diffuse clouds\n\ndiffuse gas, for instance, n(H) = 50 cm\u22123 , TK = 50 K yields a\ntypical thermal pressure in the ISM, but n(H2 )/n(H) < 1 in such\na gas. Thus even our high ad hoc formation rate for CO predicts\nX(12 CO) somewhat below 10\u22127 in unshielded regions g12 = 1\nand the observed CO is likely to be largely unshielded at the\nlowest observed N(H2 ).

If the direct formation rate of carbon\nmonoxide were taken to be much smaller than that given here,\nas is the case in models which substantially fail to reproduce\nthe overall carbon monoxide abundance, conversion from 12 CO\nwould dominate the formation of 13 CO at far smaller X(12 CO).\nThis would make it very make it very difficult to reproduce\nratios N(12 CO)/N(12 CO) >> 60, which require strong selfshielding of the 12 CO and therefore, high X(12 CO) (see Sect.\n5.2).\n\n5.

X(CO) at the extremes of abundance\nFigure 2 shows the observed variation of X(12 CO) with N(H2 );\nwith much scatter, the regression line has unit slope (see the\ncaption); Fig. 20 of Sonnentrucker et al. (2007) appeared to\nshow that X(12 CO) \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 , independent of N(H2 ), for most\nlines of sight at N(H2 ) < 3 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 .\n\n5.1.1. The low-abundance limit\nConsidering the smallest observed CO column densities and\nabundances, at N(H2 ) \u2264 3 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 , <X(12 CO)> \u2248 8 \u00d7\n10\u22128 (Fig. 2). In light of Eq. 4c, we note that n(H)/TK \u2248 1 in\n\nComplete conversion of carbon to CO in a fully molecular\ndiffuse gas would yield X(12 CO) = 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 given the\nfree gas phase abundance of carbon determined by Sofia et al.\n(2004), implying that the highest observed fractions of carbon\nin carbon monoxide in the molecular portion of the gas are\n[12 CO]/[12 C] \u2248 0.08. These fractions are small enough to ensure that the observed gas may truly be considered diffuse, with\nnearly all carbon in the form of C+ , but they are not necessarily\nsmall enough that their effects on other species are completely\nignorable.\nFor 13 C, the fraction in 13 CO may be substantially higher\nowing to fractionation, reaching 0.20 - 0.25 (see just below).\nIn this case, the ambient molecular gas is appreciably deprived\nof free 13 C-nuclei, and account should be taken of such effects\non the isotope ratios derived from other species like CH which\nare expected to share the same volume as CO. Such sharing is\nsomewhat less obvious for CH+ but in general, it seems clear\nthat carbon isotope measurements in the diffuse ISM should\navoid sightlines having substantial CO, unless the bias caused\nby carbon monoxide fractionation can be corrected somehow. It\nseems generally to be the case that the more pronounced effect\nof CO fractionation is to deprive the ambient gas of 13 C but, if\nit were observed that N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) >> 60 at sufficiently\nhigh X(12 CO), the opposite would be the case.\nAgain considering Eq. 4c, but in the limit of large X(CO),\nX(CO) \u2192 4.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 /TK in the limit of high n(H2 ) and strong\nshielding ( I g12 \u2192 0) or X(12 CO) \u2248 10\u22124 at TK = 40 K. Noting\nthe behaviour in Fig. 1 and 2 we infer that this high-abundance\nlimit would occur only for N(H2 ) >> 3\u00d71021 cm\u22122 , N(12 CO) \u2248\n3 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 , well above the observed range. X(12 CO) = 10\u22124\nis still a factor of three below the free-carbon fraction relative to\nH2 in diffuse molecular gas. In the observed diffuse sightlines,\nthe destruction of 12 CO is dominated by photodissociation so\n12\nthat Ig12 >\n\u223c 0.01 even at the largest N(H2 ) and N( CO).\n\n5.2. Fractionation\nFigure 3 shows a summary of available measurements of the\ntwo most abundant forms of carbon monoxide observed in absorption in diffuse clouds. Sheffer et al. (2007) noted that lines\nof sight studied in 13 CO have about 20 K lower H2 J=1-0 rotational temperatures than the mean for all H2 surveyed. As\nindicated in Fig. 2, the sightlines examined in 13 CO in uv absorption are nearly always those with the very highest X(12 CO)\n\n\fTex(1-0) [Kelvin]\n\nH. S.

Variation of 12 CO J=1-0 rotational excitation temperature plotted against N(H2 ) (left) and N(12 CO). Radio data are\nshown as lower limits because they involve the assumption of a beam efficiency. Data from the work of Burgh et al. (2007)\nand Sonnentrucker et al. (2007) are shown separately; sightlines with measurements in both references are shown chained, note\nthat the former typically derives slightly stronger excitation in these cases. Data labelled \"radio\" are those of Liszt & Lucas\n(1998). Superposed on the data are calculated results for uniform-density spherical models having total densites n(H) = 64 and\n128 cm\u22123 like those used to determine N(CO) in Fig. 1, where only a handful of the sightlines represented here require n(H)\n< 64 cm\u22123 . The lower curves at each density employ an older but likely more nearly correct set of rotational excitation rates for\nH-atom + CO collisions (see Sect. 6 of the text). A minimum excitation temperature of 4.0 K is required to produce a \u03bb2.6mm\nemission line having a brightness temperature TB = 1 K.\nat a given N(H2 ), and to that extent are not entirely representative even though they vary widely in column density.\nThe data show N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) ratios in the range 15 <\nN( CO)/N(13 CO) < 170 and a tendency for the ratio to decline with increasing column density and/or relative abundance\nX(CO), but with much scatter. There is no tendency for the ratio to decline with the rotational temperature of H2 as noted\nin the Figure but the two lines of sight with the smallest ratios\nstudied optically are those with very much the lowest temperature indicated by C2 . The radio data consistently find smaller\nratios at a given column density but the effect is more pronounced in the panel at right. There has been something of a\nrecent convergence between the radio and uv absorption studies in that the latter have only now found lines of sight where\nN(12 CO)/N(13 CO) << 60, as was often found to the case in\nmm-wavelength absorption (Liszt & Lucas, 1998). Previously,\noptical absorption studies occured only along lines of sight having much larger ratios (Lambert et al., 1994; Federman et al.,\n2003) and this disparity was the source of some concern.\n12\n\nThe expected functional behaviour of the column density\nratio is as follows; at very low N(H2 ) and/or N(CO) the gas\nis unshielded, the photodissociation rates are assumed equal\nand the observed N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) ratios should be very near\nthe ratio of formation rates, presumably [12 C]/[13 C] = 60\n(Lucas & Liszt, 1998). However, as indicated in Fig. 2, the\nlines of sight chosen for study of the isotope ratio have such\nhigh CO abundances that they do not sample the unshielded\nregime. At intermediate X(CO) and N(CO), self- shielding increases the contribution of isotope exchange to 13 CO formation\nat X(12 CO) > 2 \u00d7 10\u22126, but also increases the disparity between\ng12 and g13 . Therefore, at intermediate X(CO) the column den-\n\nsity ratio N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) can be expected to be both above\nand below the intrinsic isotope ratio in the gas, with the very\nlowest values at larger N(CO). Finally, at very high N(CO), the\ncolumn density ratio must tend toward the intrinsic isotope ratio when all 12 C resides in 12 CO but this regime again is well\nbeyond the scope of the present dataset.\nIn order that the forward and backward isotope insertion\nreactions equilibrate, the rightmost terms in the numerator and\ndenominator of Eq. 4d must dominate. In the numerator of Eq.\n4d this implies X(12 CO) well above 2 \u00d7 10\u22126 or that g12 < 0.1\nin Eq. 4c; photodissociation remains the dominant mechanism\nof CO destruction well into the regime where fractionation is\nimportant. For g12 I = 1/33, n(H2 ) = 40 cm\u22123 , TK = 40 K,\nX(12 CO) = 4\u00d710\u22126 . If the disparity between the isotopic shielding terms is a factor of a few, Ig13 \u2248 0.07 \u2212 0.1, and dominance\nof the righthand term in the denominator would require n(H2 )\n>> 150 cm\u22123 . Thus, although there is substantial creation of\n13\nCO via isotope exchange , it does not occur in a portion of parameter space where the isotope insertion actually equilibrates,\ncreating a reliable gas thermometer.\n\n5.3. What do we learn from 12 CO/13 CO ratios?\nFigure 4 shows the observed CO abundance ratios plotted\nagainst X(12 CO) along with the results of some toy models following the expressions in Eq. 4c and 4d, along with the additional parametrization g13 = g0.6\n12 . The parameter having the\ngreatest influence on the observed isotope ratio is the external\nphotodissociation rate, rather than the density or temperature.\nIn detail, these observations are very hard to interpret in terms\nof either the detailed physical properties of the gas or the in-\n\n\f8\n\nH. S. Liszt: Formation, fractionation and excitation of carbon monoxide in diffuse clouds\n\ntrinsic carbon isotope ratio. The old hope that CO fractionation\nwould serve as a reliable thermometer is not fulfilled.\nHowever, in very general terms it does appear that the isotopic abundance ratios seen in carbon monoxide can be understood in terms of relatively mundane chemical and photoprocesses in quiescent gas of moderate density, even if it is\ndifficult to derive the underlying physical conditions from the\nratios themselves. This is analogous to the recognition that CO\ncan form in the observed quantities from the quiescent thermal\ngas phase electron recombination of the observed amounts of\nHCO+ , and in very great contrast to considerations of the abundances of HCO+ and most other molecular species observed in\ndiffuse gas, certainly all the polyatomics and many diatomics\nlike CS, whereby quiescent models fail by very large factors.\n\n6. J=1-0 rotational excitation and line brightness\n\n6.1. Observed rotational excitation\nIn optical absorption, carbon monoxide rotational excitation\ntemperatures are derived directly from measurements of column densities in individual rotational levels (Burgh et al.,\n2007; Sonnentrucker et al., 2007) and N(H2 ) is generally\nknown. At mm-wavelengths, the measurements are of optical depths and line brightnesses in rotational transitions\n(Liszt & Lucas, 1998) and the H2 column density is inferred\nindirectly, by assuming N(HCO+ )/N(H2 ) = 2 \u00d7 10\u22129 .\nShown in Fig. 5 are J=1-0 rotational excitation temperatures Tex (1-0) from these references. They are very nearly\nunanimous in showing (at left) that lines of sight with N(H2 )\n20\n\u22122\n<\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 cm have Tex (1-0) <\n\u223c 4 K; 4.0 K is the smallest\nexcitation temperature capable of producing a 1.0 K brightness\ntemperature above the cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nin the \u03bb2.6mm J=1-0 line. The same data are plotted against\nN(12 CO) at right in Fig. 5, where some disparity occurs between the radio and optical absorption data; a few lines of sight\nhaving N(12 CO) \u2248 1015 cm\u22122 exhibit somewhat brighter J=1-0\nlines than would be allowed by a 4 K excitation temperature.\nFigure 6 shows the observations recast as integrated\nR\u03bb2.6mm J=1-0 rotational brightness temperatures WCO =\nTB (1 \u2212 0)dv. At radio wavelengths, these are directly observed to within a scale factor, the beam efficiency. For optical\nabsorption data, the line brightness can be crafted from the rotational level populations, which fix the integrated optical depth;\nthe central optical depth is then specified by the b- parameter,\nso that the line brightness can be integrated over the profile.\nFor optically thin lines the integrated brightness is independent\nof the b-value, but many of the lines of sight with N(12 CO)\n> 1015 cm\u22122 observed in uv absorption are predicted to be\nsomewhat opaque at \u03bb2.6mm, in keeping with direct measurements shown by Liszt & Lucas (1998). For Tex (1-0) = 2.73 K\nor 4.0 K, the integrated optical depth of the J=1-0 transition is\n1 km s\u22121 when N(12 CO) = 1.0 or 1.6 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . Finally, note\nthat Burgh et al. (2007) published only N(12 CO) and Tex (1-0);\nto specify the rotational level populations fully we assumed\nthat the excitation temperatures of higher-lying levels were the\nsame as that of the J=1-0 line. The excitation is weak enough\n\nthat this is not a major problem, little population exists in levels\nabove J=2.\nAt left, Fig. 6 shows the integrated brightness temperature and H2 column density for the optical absorption data.\nAlso shown are the predicted (Sonnentrucker et al., 2007) and\nobserved (Liszt, 1997) brightnesses toward \u03b6 Oph; the excitation temperature derived by Sonnentrucker et al. (2007)\nis noticeably smaller than earlier values (Smith et al., 1978;\nWannier et al., 1982) leading to a low predicated WCO and\nlarger implied optical depth in the J=1-0 line. Corresponding\ndata comparing WCO and N(HCO+ ) were not provided by\nLucas & Liszt (1998), so, to test the consistency of the optical and mm-wave results, as elsewhere in this work, we used\na set of unpublished, very sensitive, low galactic latitude CO\nemission and HCO+ absorption profiles and simply compared\nthe integrated CO brightness and HCO+ optical depths, scaling\nthe latter appropriately to form N(HCO+ ) and N(H2 ) as done by\nLucas & Liszt (1998) and Lucas & Liszt (1996). This is the one\nexception noted in Sect. 2 to the use of previously-published\ndata. In any case, it can be seen from Fig. 6 at left that the radio\nand optical data show the same behaviour.\nThis comparison of WCO and N(H2 ) is tantamount to specifying the CO-H2 conversion factor; indeed, this regime is really\nthe only one in which the conversion factor may be derived\nfrom direct measurement of the two constituents. Clearly the\nratio of N(H2 )/WCO is typically very large for weak-lined diffuse CO-bearing gas, compared with the usually assumed local\nvalues N(H2 )/WCO = 2 \u2212 3 \u00d7 1020 H2 /K-km s\u22121 . However, for\nsightlines of sight with WCO > 1 K km s\u22121 , the ratio is nearly\ncanonical or perhaps a bit low. This insight, that the CO-H2\nconversion factor attains nearly its canonical values at rather\nsmall N(CO) was at the heart of the original discussion of Liszt\n(1982).\nThe plot of WCO vs. N(12 CO) at right in Fig. 6 shows\na well-defined proportionality, as noted earlier (Fig. 12 of\nLiszt & Lucas (1998)) and there is good agreement between\nthe optical and radio data when CO emission was actually detected at \u03bb 2.6mm, at N(12 CO) > 6 \u00d7 1014 cm\u22122 . Apparently,\nWCO is a fairly robust and accurate estimator of the CO column density itself and scatter in the CO-H2 conversion factor\narises from the vagaries of the chemistry. Note that Fig. 6 at\nright reverts to use of the previously published mm-wave data.\nFor N(12 CO) \u2248 3 \u2212 5 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 the brightness saturates at\nWCO \u2248 3 \u2212 6 K km s\u22121 as the lines become very optically thick.\nThis highlights the fact that the transition to complete C\u2192CO\nconversion must occur over a relatively small range of N(H2 ); if\ndiffuse cloud lines of sight commonly show J=1-0 lines of several K, not grossly different from typical dark gas even when\nonly a few percent of the free carbon is in carbon monoxide,\nand if the CO-H2 conversion factor is about the same for dark\nand brighter-lined diffuse gas, it follows that there must be\na very rapid increase of X(CO) over a very small interval in\nN(H2 ) and WCO , over and above that seen in Fig. 1.\n\n\fH.

Direct radio observations toward \u03b6 Oph are also shown chained to the equivalent optical datapoint. Data from the work of\nBurgh et al. (2007) and Sonnentrucker et al. (2007) are shown separately and the radio observations are those of (Liszt & Lucas,\n1998) at right; see Sect. 6.1 for an explanation of the radio data plotted at left.\n\n6.2. Interpretation of the rotational excitation\nUntil recently, it seemed appropriate to neglect the contribution\nof excitation by H-atoms, for which the cross-sections were\ncalculated to be relatively small (Green & Thaddeus, 1976),\nto assume a largely molecular host gas, and to use the CO\nJ=1-0 rotational excitation temperature as a probe of the ambient thermal pressure; it could be shown from calculations\nthat there was a nearly linear increase of Tex (1-0) with n(H2 )TK\n(Smith et al., 1978; Liszt, 1979; Liszt & Lucas, 1998) as long\nas Tex << TK . This variation of Tex (1-0) with the ambient\nthermal pressure of H2 presumably occurs as a result of the\nsmall permanent dipole moment of CO since the excitation of\nother species with higher dipole moments is typically sensitive mostly to density. However, a recent calculation of the rotational excitation rates of CO by H-atoms yielded the result\nthat the per-particle excitation by hydrogen atoms was much\nstronger than by H2 (Balakrishnan et al., 2002). In this case\neven a small admixture of H-atoms can have a marked effect\non the excitation of CO (Liszt, 2006) and it is not allowable to\nderive the ambient thermal partial pressure of H2 directly from\nTex (1-0) by assuming a purely molecular host gas.\nAs this manuscript was being revised, it was learned (P.\nStancil, private communication, Shepler et al. (2007)) that the\ncalculation of Balakrishnan et al. (2002) had been reconsidered and that the older, smaller H-atom excitation rates were\nin fact more nearly appropriate. Results for both sets of rates\nare shown here. The choice of excitation rates has several interesting consequences for the interpretation, as noted below.\nModel results for the CO excitation are superposed In Fig.\n5 and 6. These were calculated by running models ( like those\nused to calculate N(CO) in Fig. 1) at fixed n(H) (as indicated in\nthe Figures) and N(H) toward the center, plotting results from\n\nsightlines having impact parameters ranging from the outer\nedge to center. For each model of given n(H) and N(H), the rotational level populations were integrated for each sightline and\nthe result plotted as a point in the Figure. Results for n(H) below 64 cm\u22123 are not shown because only a handful of the sightlines represented in Fig. 5 are compatible with n(H) < 64 cm\u22123\nin Fig. 1 (where they are shown outlined and in green to make\njust this point).\nShown in Fig. 5 are results for models having n(H) = 64\nand 128 H-nuclei cm\u22123 using the H-atom excitation rates\nof Green & Thaddeus (1976) (as approximated by Warin et al.\n(1996)) and those of Balakrishnan et al. (2002). The models include excitation by atomic H and He, and ortho and para-H2 and\nthe effects of photon-trapping were calculated in the microturbulent approximation for a b-parameter of 0.8 km s\u22121 . The\ncharacteristic shape of the upper three curves in Fig. 5 is determined by an increase in the fraction of atomic H toward the left,\nand by resonant photon-trapping at higher optical depth toward\nthe right. With strong excitation by atomic hydrogen, calculated values of Tex (1-0) increase with n(H) at small N(H2 ) or\nN(12 CO). Models using the older cross-sections for excitation\nby atomic hydrogen do not exhibit such an increase because the\noverall excitation is weak when the molecular fraction is small.\nOnly if the smaller H-atom excitation rates are appropriate\nwill the models used to calculate X(CO) also do an acceptable\njob of reproducing the observed excitation at like density. The\nexcitation temperatures derived from the uv absorption data are\na bit lower than before, but mostly there is the problem that\nthe fraction of gas which remains in atomic form in the models (which self-consistently determine the local H2 density) is\nlarge enough to have a profound effect on the excitation. Lines\nof sight with the smallest N(H2 ) and X(12 CO) are expected to\nhave formed CO in the least purely molecular gas and therefore\n\n\f10\n\nH. S. Liszt: Formation, fractionation and excitation of carbon monoxide in diffuse clouds\n\nto show the highest excitation temperatures, opposite to what\nis observed , if the rates of Balakrishnan et al. (2002) are employed. Except perhaps for the anomalous-seeming radio data\nnear N(12 CO) = 1015 cm\u22122 at the right in Fig. 5, the calculated\nrotational excitation is far too high, mainly due to the admixture of residual atomic hydrogen in the CO-bearing regions.\nThe situation with respect to the integrated brightness\nshown in Fig. 6 is clearer, as the models actually account\nquite well for the variation of WCO with N(H2 ) at left and\nthey only slightly overestimate the run of WCO with N(12 CO).\nFurthermore, the calculated values of WCO are not strongly\ndependent on which set of cross-sections for excitation by H\natoms is used. This implies that it may be possible to calculate the CO-H2 conversion factor reliably, although it should be\nstressed that the models form CO rather artificially. Moreover,\nif the larger H-atom excitation rates of Balakrishnan et al.\n(2002) are employed, the disparity in the ability of the models to account for both Tex and WCO implies that the calculated\noptical depths are much lower than those which are actually\nobserved at \u03bb2.6mm or inferred from the uv absorption data.\n\n7. Loose ends and unanswered questions\nThe comparison of CO with H2 in diffuse clouds can now\nbe based on a dataset which far exceeds that for any other\ntrace molecule. Over the diffuse regime, the run of N(CO) with\nN(H2 ) actually seems more consistent and understandable than\nthat of CH, which suffers from an unexplained decline in its relative abundance at N(H2 ) < 7\u00d71019 cm\u22122 (see Fig. 1); at higher\nN(H2 ), N(CH)/N(H2 ) \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22128 with relatively small scatter.\nFurther observations of CH and other species are required in\nthe regime of moderate N(H2 ) and nascent polyatomic chemistry.\nOn average, the mean N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) ratio is near the local interstellar isotope ratio [12 C]/[13 C] = 60, but fractionation\neffects cause the N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) to vary between 20 and 170\nwith lower values at somewhat higher N(12 CO). The fraction\nof free gas-phase 13 C in 13 CO is large enough in some cases\nthat other species sharing the same volume must be somewhat\nstarved for 13 C, artificially biasing the ratio of their 12 C- and\n13\nC-bearing variants. However, the effects of sharply-varying\nfractionation might perhaps be most pernicious for mm-wave\nemission studies, which typically rely on ratios of brightness\ntemperatures in 12 CO and 13 CO, coupled with the assumption\nof a fixed abundance ratio N(12 CO)/N(13 CO), to infer 12 CO\noptical depths, excitation temperatures and column densities.\nUnrecognizable systematic variations in N(12 CO)/N(13 CO)\ncould wreak havoc with interpretation of such datasets.\nAt the present time it is unclear whether fractionation in\nCO can be regarded as anything more than a nuisance: the observed N(12 CO)/N(13 CO) ratios result from several competing\ninfluences including direct formation, carbon isotope exchange\nand selective photodissociation, none of which dominates to\nthe extent that the local temperature or density can be inferred.\nAt least in the uv datasets, 12 CO/13 CO ratios have generally\nbeen measured along lines of sight having only rather high\nX(CO) and over a relatively modest range of N(H2 ) (see Fig.\n2). This may have introduced some bias but interpreting the ob-\n\nservations is sufficiently difficult that further discussion of the\nfractionation may not be rewarding per se. However, study of\n13\nCO may be rewarding for other reasons, especially at higher\nN(12 CO) and N(H2 ) as more complete carbon conversion to CO\noccurs.\nThe convergence of the CO-H2 conversion factor for diffuse and dark gas well within the diffuse regime (at N(CO)\n16\n\u22122\n<\n\u223c 10 cm in Fig. 6 at left) suggests that the full conversion\nof carbon to CO must occur over a very narrow range of extinction, N(H2 ), etc. just beyond the diffuse regime. This may\nleave very little room in parameter space for a \"translucent\"\nregime in which neutral carbon is the dominant carbon-bearing\nspecies. Given that the CO abundance in dark gas is typically\nfound to be X(CO) = 8 \u2212 10 \u00d7 10\u22125 , some 3-4 times smaller\nthan 2[C]/[H] \u2248 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 in diffuse gas, we are left to ask just\nwhere the transition from diffuse to dark gas actually occurs in\nterms of N(H2 ) and what is the carbon budget in the transition\nregime.\nIn the diffuse regime, the CO-H2 conversion factor is actually measured and found to attain values N(H2 )/WCO = 2 \u2212\n3 \u00d7 1020 H2 /K-km s\u22121 along rather thin lines of sight where the\nfraction of free gas-phase carbon in CO is only a few percent.\nThese lines of sight also have WCO of a few K-km s\u22121 , as is\ntypical of darker material. Again we are left to wonder how\nmuch room in parameter space is actually left for a translucent\nregime.\nThe observed CO-H2 conversion factors and CO J=1-0 rotational line brightnesses are actually well-explained by the\nuniform density models whose results are presented in Figs.\n1, 5 and 6. The most notable possible failure in the interpretation here is the mismatch between the too-large excitation temperatures and too-small optical depths predicted by the models for the J=1-0 rotational transition (see Fig. 5 at left) when\nthe recent calculation of the H-atom + CO excitation rates\nby Balakrishnan et al. (2002) is employed (see Sect. 6.2). The\nmodels are uniform and rather diffuse and so leave a substantial\nfraction of H-nuclei in atomic form in some cases. Excitation\nby such H atoms was ignorable using older excitation rates\n(Green & Thaddeus, 1976) but the rates of Balakrishnan et al.\n(2002) are so large that even a slight amount of residual atomic\nhydrogen would have a profound effect. Although the disagreement between observed and measured excitation temperatures\nseems to point to the need to sequester CO in regions of nearly\npure H2 , the agreement is actually worst for the most diffuse\ngas with the smallest N(CO) and X(CO). Should such gas really be expected to be the most purely molecular ? Perhaps the\nneatest way around this problem lies with the apparent recent\nrealization that the older, smaller excitation rates by H atoms\nare actually more nearly correct. In this case the models do a\ngood job of reproducing the rotational excitation of CO at the\nsame densities at which CO forms, even if the ambient hydrogen is not exclusively molecular.\nThere is little difference in 12 CO J=1-0 line brightness between dark clouds with X(12 CO) = 10\u22124 , N(12 CO) = 3 \u2212\n10 \u00d7 1017 cm\u22122 and that from diffuse clouds with X(12 CO)\n= 2 \u00d7 10\u22125 , N(12 CO) = 3 \u2212 10 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . Although dark and\ndiffuse gas may better be distinguished on the basis of observations of 13 CO (acknowledging possible effects of fractionation)\n\n\fH. S. Liszt: Formation, fractionation and excitation of carbon monoxide in diffuse clouds\n\nor C18 O, such data are not always available. Given the prevalence of diffuse gas at larger distances from the center of the\nGalaxy and larger distances from the galactic plane, it seems\nworthwhile to ask whether possible confusion between diffuse\nand dark gas has caused misjudgement of the quantity and character of molecular gas in our own or other galaxies.\nAcknowledgements.
