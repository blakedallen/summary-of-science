Hydrodynamic Calculations of Neutron Star Coalescences\nThe possible impact of merging neutron stars for r-process nucleosynthesis has been\nrealized many years ago [1\u20134]. To quantify this issue we have performed detailed hydrodynamic studies of the last inspiral stages and the final coalescence of neutron star\nbinary systems. We used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics method to solve the hydrodynamic equations coupled with the nuclear equation of state of Lattimer and Swesty\n([5]; LS-EOS). To resolve shocks accurately a largely improved, hybrid artificial viscosity\nscheme [6] that profits from two recently suggested modifications of the 'standard scheme'\n[7,8] has been applied. Gravitational forces are evaluated efficiently using a binary tree [9],\nthe backreaction forces resulting from the emission of gravitational waves are accounted\nfor in the quadrupole approximation of point masses [10,6]. For further details and test\ncalculations we refer to [10,6].\nTo explore the possible range of outcomes depending on the physical parameters of neutron star binary systems a variety of different initial configurations has been examinated.\nFor example, binary systems -symmetric and asymmetric ones- with six different initial\nspin combinations and three different neutron star masses (1.3, 1.4 and 1.6 M\u2299 ) have been\n\n\f2\nlog(rho[g/ccm]) at t= 6.1286 ms\n\n60\n40\n\ny [ km ]\n\n20\n0\n\u221220\n\u221240\n\u221260\n\u221260\n\n\u221240\n\n\u221220\n\n0\nx [ km ]\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\nFigure 1. Density contour snap shot in the orbital plane. The binary system contains\nneutron stars of 1.3 and 1.4 M\u2299 and is initially corotating. The ejected material is located\nin the tip of the long spiral arm.\n\ninvestigated.\nIn all of these cases between \u223c 4 * 10\u22123 and \u223c 4 * 10\u22122 M\u2299 were ejected into space. Folded\nwith the estimates for the event rate of \u223c 10\u22125 per year and galaxy [11\u201313], this amount\ncould contribute substantially to the enrichment of the Galaxy with heavy elements, provided that the ejecta contain large amounts of r-process nuclei.\n2. Fully dynamical r-process Network Calculations\nTo clarify issue of the abundances within these ejecta, we have taken the history of a\nblob of ejected material located in a rapidly expanding spiral arm from our best resolved\ncalculation (a corotating binary system) as a starting point for the network calculations.\nFor two reasons Ye is treated as a free parameter in these calculations. First, with the\ncurrent resolution of our 3D-calculations we cannot follow closely enough the steep density\ngradients in the thin, but rather proton rich neutron star surface, that determine the\ninitial Ye via the beta-equilibrium condition \u03bc\u0302 = \u03bce (Ye ). Second, Ye evolves during the\ncoalescence process by means of weak interactions. Thus all the relevant weak interaction\nprocesses and neutrino transport should be included, which is currently not the case. We\nstarted our nucleosynthesis calculations at a point where the density dropped below the\nneutron drip density. Above this density all beta-decays are Pauli-blocked and thus the\nmaterial cools adiabatically during the rapid expansion. Along the expansion trajectory\nof the ejected matter blob all relevant nuclear reactions including beta-decays have been\nfollowed [14]. The temperature history within the ejecta is determined by the interplay of\ncooling due to the rapid expansion and the heat input from the decaying nuclei. To ensure\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2. Calculated abundance patterns for different initial Ye -values.\n\nthat results are not influenced by possibly artificially high numerical temperatures, we also\nperformed test calculations starting exclusively with neutrons and protons at an artificially\nlow temperature (T = 10\u22122 MeV). In this case the almost immediate recombination of\nthe nucleons into \u03b1-particles heated up the material to r-process-like temperatures on\nextremely short time scales [14].\nIn all investigated cases r-process took place, and the initial Ye turned out to be the\ndecisive parameter that determined the resulting abundance distribution. For Ye -values\ntoo large or too small the abundance peaks were shifted towards those of the s-process, for\nYe close to 0.1 the solar abundances above A > 130 are very closely reproduced. Isotopes\nwith A < 130 very largely underabundant compared to the solar values.\n3. Discussion\nDespite recent progress in the questions related to the nucleosynthetic impact of neutron\nstar mergers uncertainties remain:\n\u2022 EOS: While matter properties at subnuclear densities seem to be reasonably well\nunderstood, the high density regime, where exotic nuclear states are expected to\nappear, remains rather uncertain. We found that the stiffness of the neutron star\nEOS has a dramatic effect on the amount of ejected material. For example, a\ncorotating binary system following the rather stiff LS-EOS releases \u223c 4 * 10\u22122 M\u2299 in\nthe tips of the emerging spiral arms, while for a similar system governed by a \u0393 = 2.0polytrope does not show any resolvable mass loss [10]. Test runs with polytropes\nof density dependent stiffness revealed that it is unfortunately the poorly known\nhigh density regime that determines the amount of ejected material. Therefore, if\nthe nuclear matter at high density should be softer (stiffer) than the LS-EOS less\n\n\f4\n(more) material should become unbound. Most recent EOSs [15,16] are rather stiff\nand therefore support the results found with the LS-EOS.\n\u2022 Gravity: A neutron star binary is unquestionably a highly relativistic system. Thus,\nusing (basically) Newtonian gravity can only be a first approach for the exploration\nof the system dynamics. Recently, progress has been made using approximations\nto full GR (e.g. [17\u201319]). One might suspect the stronger gravity forces of GR\nto reduce the amount of ejected material. However, this point will have to be\nclarified by further studies with a sophisticated gravity treatment and the relevant\nmicrophysics input.\n\u2022 Weak interactions and neutrino transport: As has been shown, the initial Ye of the\nejected material plays a crucial role in determining the resulting abundances of the\nthe ejected material. To improve on this aspect of the problem first of all higher\nresolution is needed to resolve the low density neutron star crust with its higher Ye\nvalues. In addition the weak interaction physics (including neutrino transport) has\nto be incorporated consistently as well as efficiently to predict the evolution of Ye\nduring the coalescence and ejection process.\nDespite these uncertainties it has to be stated that if EOS and gravity allow for the ejection\nof non-negligible amounts of material and Ye is close to 0.1, which is a very reasonable\nvalue for neutron star material, neutron star mergers will contribute r-process nuclei in\nsolar abundances for nuclei with A > 130 and strongly underabundant amounts of nuclei\nwith A < 130. This is in excellent agreement with recent observations of metal-poor stars\n[23,24] that show a remarkable concordance of heavy r-process nuclei with scaled solar\nr-process abundances that breaks down for nuclei below A \u2248 130.\nRecently, observations of metal-poor stars have been used to argue against the possibility\nof NSMs as substantial sources of Galactic r-process material [20]. On average, each\nvolume of the interstellar medium containing \u2248 3 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 is enriched by 103 supernovae\n(SNe) in order to obtain solar metallicities. On the other hand, the typical mass of the\ninterstellar medium (ISM) into which the ejecta of an SN remnant are mixed (before the\nremnant shock is quenched) is of the order 3 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 as well. Thus, if the r-process\nwould originate from SNe, the abundances in the affected ISM resulting from a single\nSN event in prior unpolluted regions would amount to (r/H)SN \u2248 10\u22123 (r/H)\u2299 . Since\nNSM rates are lower than SN rates by approximately three orders of magnitude this ratio\nwould in the case of a NSM origin be 0 in unpolluted ISM and close to solar in matter\nwhich experienced NSM ejecta, provided that the mass of the mixed ISM is similar to SN\nremnants. Such behaviour is not observed in low metallicity stars and therefore NSMs\nwould be ruled out as candidate sites for the r-process.\nThe arguments raised in [20], however, are too simplistic since they omit two important\naspects. (1) The amount of NSM ejecta mixing with the ISM is not clear (total energetics\nand ring-like rather than spherical ejection). (2) The more important point is that the lowmetallicity observations measure the abundances in individual stars rather than in mixed\nremnants. Only if the same mass would be swept up and if stars would form from fully\nmixed regions the above argument against NSMs holds. The mixing process of elemental\nyields from core collapse supernovae with the ISM has recently been simulated with a 3D\n\n\f5\nstochastic model in order to understand the evolution of the scatter in [element/Fe] ratios\nduring the history of the Galaxy [21]. According to this work the mixing proceeds via\nthe following stages: for [Fe/H] < \u22123.0 (corresponding to a Galactic age of \u223c 200 Myrs;\n[21] Fig. 6) the ISM is not mixed, but rather dominated by local inhomogeneities leading\nto a very large scatter in the observed abundances of individual stars, in agreement with\nobservations. For [Fe/H] > -2.0 (\u223c 1500 Myrs) the ISM is well-mixed (small scatter in\nobservations), inbetween a continuous transition between both regimes is encountered. It\ncould also be shown that a stochastic choice of star formation can lead to much smaller\nmetallicities than expected from a well mixed remnant. For events which occur with a much\nsmaller frequency (like NSM) this mixed phase should be delayed to larger metallicities.\nIn addition, one expects with the large amounts of r-ejecta from NSMs a much larger\nscatter than for SNe. Both effects are seen in the r/Fe observations (a scatter of more\nthan a factor of 100 at low metallicities which still amounts to a factor of 10 at [Fe/H]=-1,\nsee Fig. 2 in [22]). This fact combined with the suppression of abundances below A=130\nin low-metallicity stars, can be taken as supportive features to a fission cycling r-process\nfrom a low frequency source such as NSMs. Galactic evolution calculations as in [21] are\nneeded in order to test the expected amount of scatter as a function of metallicity.\nREFERENCES\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n\nJ.M.
