In this work we discuss\nthe relevance of the method for the calculation of the Laplace-Borel integral expressing formally the QCD Green functions. We define an optimal expansion of the\nLaplace-Borel integral in the principal value prescription and establish conditions\nunder which the expansion is convergent.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nA suitable method for accelerating the convergence of power series is based on conformal\nmappings. As is known, a power series converges inside the circle passing through the\nnearest singularity of the function to be approximated. Some time ago, in Ref. [1], it\nwas shown that, if the position of the singularities of the expanded function is known,\none can reach the fastest convergence rate by expanding in powers of the function that\nconformally maps the whole holomorphy domain onto a unit disk. In addition, the convergence region extends over the whole holomorphy domain. In a recent paper [2] we applied\nthe technique proposed in [1] to the Borel transform of the Green functions in perturbative QCD. As discussed in [2], the Borel plane is very suitable for applying the method,\nsince some information about the singularities of the Borel transform is available from the\nstudy of certain classes of Feynman digrams and from nonperturbative arguments. By\nthe technique of conformal mapping, this additional information can to a certain extent\nbe incorporated even into the lowest-order terms. In this way, the convergence of the\nperturbative expansion is improved, allowing one in particular to approximately predict\nthe next-order perturbative terms from the calculated low-order ones [2].\nIn Ref.[2] the expansion in powers of the optimal conformal mapping variable1 was\nalso used to calculate the Borel-Laplace integral, which is supposed to give, with a certain\nprescription of treating the infrared renormalons, the Borel summation of the large orders\nin the Green functions. The numerical results on mathematical models discussed in [2]\nindicate that the power expansion in the optimal variable makes also the calculation of\nthe Borel integral convergent, in addition with a very high convergence rate. However,\nonly qualitative arguments explaining the results were given, and the problem whether the\nimproved expansion of the integral is convergent, or signs of divergence might appear at\nlarge orders, remained open. In the present paper we address this problem and investigate\nthe convergence of the expansion of the Borel integral in perturbative QCD, improved by\nthe use of conformal mapping.\n\n2\n\nOptimal expansion of the Laplace-Borel integral\n\nWe study the following integral\nI(a) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\nu\n\ne\u2212 a B(u) du ,\n\n(1)\n\n0\n\nwhere B(u) is assumed to be analytic near u = 0, where it can be expanded as a Taylor\nseries\n\u221e\nB(u) =\n\nX\n\nbn un\n\n(2)\n\nn=0\n1\nThe conformal mapping that maps the whole holomorphy domain of the expanded function onto the\nunit disk will be called optimal. In this case, the singularities are mapped onto the boundary circle, and\nthe requirement of holomorphy implies convergence of the power series at every point of the disk, which\nis the map of the holomorphy domain.\n\n1\n\n\fconverging inside a circle of non-vanishing radius. The function I(a) is of interest for the\nBorel summation of the Green functions in perturbative QCD; note, however, that the integral on the right hand side of (1) is ill-defined if B(u) has singularities along the positive\nreal semiaxis, which is the case of QCD (infrared renormalons). First, the singularities\nof B(u) (renormalons of either kind) make the expansion (2) badly divergent along the\nintegration path. Second, the function B(u) itself is, because of infrared renormalons, not\nuniquely defined along the integration path. We shall discuss both these problems below\nin this paper.\nWe shall consider for illustration the Adler function D(s) of the massless QCD vacuum\npolarization, which can be expressed formally as [3]-[6]\nD(s) = 1 +\n\n1\nI(a) ,\n\u03c0\u03b20\n\n(3)\n\nwith a = \u03b20 \u03b1s (\u2212s), where \u03b1s (\u2212s) is the running coupling, and \u03b20 = (33 \u2212 2nf )/12\u03c0\nis the first coefficient of the \u03b2 function. The expression (3) formally reproduces the\nrenormalization-group-improved expansion of the Adler function\nD(s) = 1 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nDn\n\nn=1\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b1s (\u2212s)\n\u03c0\n\n\u0013n\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nby taking the coefficients bn in the expansion (2) of the form\nbn =\n\n1 Dn+1\n.\nn! (\u03c0\u03b20 )n\n\n(5)\n\nWe consider also minkowskian quantities, like the hadronic decay rate of the \u03c4 lepton,\nR\u03c4 , which can be expressed formally as [5]\n#\n\u0012\n\u0013\nu\n1 Z\u221e\ndu exp \u2212\nB(u) F (u) .\nR\u03c4 = 3(1 + \u03b4EW ) 1 +\n\u03c0\u03b20 0\n\u03b20 \u03b1s (m2\u03c4 )\n\"\n\n(6)\n\nHere \u03b4EW is an electroweak correction, B(u) is the Borel transform of the Adler function\nand\n\u221212 sin(\u03c0u)\nF (u) =\n.\n(7)\n\u03c0 u(u \u2212 1)(u \u2212 3)(u \u2212 4)\nThe extra factor sin(\u03c0u) in the Laplace-Borel integral is generic for minkowskian quantities. Note that strictly speaking the expressions (3) and (6) are not equivalent to the\nBorel summation method, which requires an analytic continuation of B(u) from the convergence disk to an infinite strip of non-vanishing width, bisected by the real positive\nsemiaxis. This condition is not fulfilled in QCD because of infrared renormalons, which\nproduce cuts of B(u) located along the real positive semiaxis.\nWe shall be concerned with the evaluation of the integral (1) for complex a of the\ngeneral form a = |a|ei\u03c8 , where \u03c8 = arg a is the phase of a. In the case of the Adler function,\nwith the running coupling at one loop in the V scheme \u03b1s(V ) (\u2212s) = 1/[\u03b20 ln(\u2212s/\u039b2V )], and\nwriting \u2212s = |s| ei(\u03c6\u2212\u03c0) , we have\n|s|\n1\n= ln 2 \u2212 i(\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6) .\na\n\u039bV\n2\n\n(8)\n\n\fOutside the Landau region, i.e. for |s| > \u039b2V , we have cos \u03c8 > 0, so that\n\u03c0\n|\u03c8| < ,\n2\nand \u03c8 is related to the momentum plane variable s by\n\"\n\n|s|\n\u03c8 = Arctg (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6)/ ln 2\n\u039bV\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nThe phase \u03c8 is positive for s in the upper half of the s- plane, where 0 < \u03c6 < \u03c0, negative\nfor s in the lower half-plane, where \u03c0 < \u03c6 < 2\u03c0, and 0 along the euclidean axis.\nFor the minkowskian quantity (6) we combine the additional factors exp(\u00b1i\u03c0u) due\nto the sinus with the exponential, which amounts to taking a complex with\n\u03c8 = \u00b1Arctg [\u03c0\u0101] ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u0101 = \u03b20 \u03b1s (m2\u03c4 ).\nAs already mentioned, the Borel transform B(u) has singularities in the complex plane,\ncorrelated to the factorial increase of the perturbative coefficients of the Green functions\nat large orders [7], [8]. The precise form of the singularities is not known for the exact\ntheory, but the position and the nature of the first renormalons can be inferred from\ngeneral principles. In the case of the Adler function the first ultraviolet (UV) renormalon\nis situated at u = \u22121 and the first infrared (IR) one at u = 2, and they are branch points\nof the type (1 + u)\u03b31 and (2 \u2212 u)\u03b32 respectively, with \u03b31 computed in Ref. [10] and \u03b32 in\n[7]. We mention also that the summation of the one-renormalon chains in massless QCD\nin the large \u03b20 limit gives [8], [9]:\nB(u) =\n\n\u221e\n32e\u2212Cu X\n(\u22121)k k\n,\n3(2 \u2212 u) k=2 [k 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 u)2 ]2\n\n(12)\n\ni.e. all the singularities are poles (C is a scheme-dependent constant, with C = \u22125/3 in\nthe MS scheme, and C = 0 in the V scheme) [3], [6].\nThe series (2) converges only inside the circle |u| < R passing through the nearest\nsingularity (R = 1 for the Adler function). Since the integration range in (1) extends far\noutside this region, by inserting (2) in (1) and integrating term by term one obtains a\ndivergent expansion. By the technique of conformal mappings one extends the domain of\nconvergence of a series beyond the limit imposed by the first singularity. In [2] we used\nthe optimal conformal mapping\nq\n\u221a\n1 + u \u2212 1 \u2212 u/2\nq\n,\n(13)\nw = w(u) = \u221a\n1 + u + 1 \u2212 u/2\n\nwith the inverse u(w) = 8w/(3 \u2212 2w + 3w 2). The transformation (13) preserves the origin\nand maps the complex u plane, cut along the real axis for u > 2 and for u < \u22121, onto the\ninterior of the circle |w| < 1, all the singularities of the Borel transform being mapped\nonto the boundary |w| = 1. The expansion in powers of w ,\nB(u) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n3\n\ncn w n ,\n\n(14)\n\n\fis called optimal because it converges inside the circle |w| < 1, i.e. in the whole domain of\nholomorphy of B(u) (which is the doubly cut complex u-plane in our case), up to points\nclose to the branch cuts produced by renormalons. As was already pointed out above, this\npower expansion yields, when compared with other conformal mappings, the fastest largeorder convergence rate (see a proof in [1]). In practice, as discussed in [2], the expansion\n(14) is obtained by suitably reorganizing the summation of the original series (2). More\nprecisely, consider the expansion of each un in powers of w, truncated at a finite order N.\nIn particular, in our case this expansion has the general form\nN\nX\n\nunN =\n\ncnj w j ,\n\n(15)\n\nj=n\n\nwith the coefficients cnj obtained by expressing u in terms of w (in our case u(w) is\ngiven explicitly after formula (13)). Starting now with the expansion (2) truncated at\nfinite order N, and replacing each un by its approximant unN , one obtains a truncated\nexpansion of the function B in powers of w, which in the limit N \u2192 \u221e gives (14).\nBy inserting the optimal expansion (14) into the integral (1) we obtain the formal\ndevelopment\nI(a) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ncn In (a) ,\n\n(16)\n\nn=0\n\nwith\nIn (a) =\n\nZ\u221e\n\nu\n\ne\u2212 a w n du .\n\n(17)\n\n0\n\nIn the present work we shall adopt (16) as the optimal expansion of the Laplace-Borel\nintegral. We point out that in the physical case this seems to be a natural definition.\nIndeed, when attempting to make the Borel summation of a perturbation expansion in\nQCD, one starts with a finite sum of the form\nIN (a) =\n\nN\nX\n\nbn\n\nn=0\n\nZ\u221e\n\nu\n\ne\u2212 a un du .\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\nBy replacing here the powers un with the approximations (15), we replace IN (a) by an\nexpansion of the form\nN\nX\n\ncn In (a) ,\n\n(19)\n\nn=0\n\nwhich in the limit N \u2192 \u221e leads to (16).\nActually, as mentioned above, the conditions for the Borel summation are, because\nof the infrared renormalons, not fulfilled. Therefore, Eq. (16) can be considered as a\ndefinition of I(a), provided that (i) the integration path in expressions like (1) or (17) is\nconsistently defined, and (ii) the series (16) is convergent. Let us devote a brief discussion\nto these conditions.\n(i) As concerns the integration contour, let us notice that the expansion (16) has not\na precise mathematical sense with the In (a) defined by (17), because the integration path\n4\n\n\fruns along the positive real semiaxis, where the w n have cuts. We shall adopt, as in [2],\nthe generalized principal value (PV) prescription, defining the InP V (a) as\nInP V (a) =\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nu\n\ne\u2212 a (w(u))n du +\n\nC+\n\n1\n2\n\nZ\n\nu\n\ne\u2212 a (w(u))n du\n\n(20)\n\nC\u2212\n\nfor n = 0, 1, 2, ..., where C+ (C\u2212 ) are lines parallel to the real positive axis, slightly above\n(below) it. While the PV prescription does not always give the expected results [14], in\nQCD it has the advantage that it reproduces, to a larger extent than other choices, the\nmomentum plane analyticity properties of the Green functions derived from the general\nprinciples of field theory. In particular, as discussed in [15], the Adler function calculated\nwith the PV prescription has no unphysical singularities in the region |s| > \u039b2 . The\nfunctions InP V (a), n = 1, 2... are chosen so as to share some of the known properties with\nthe unknown I P V (a). This makes them suited for the definition of I P V (a) by means of\nthe expansion\nI P V (a) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ncn InP V (a) .\n\n(21)\n\nn=0\n\n(ii) The convergence of the series (21) for complex a is not a priori obvious. Indeed,\nthe expansion (14) converges at points |w| < 1, therefore in the neigbourhood of the\nintegration axis, but not necessarily on the boundary. One might therefore expect that\nthe boundary singularities could manifest in a dramatic way for very large orders N,\nmaking the series (21) divergent, like in the case of the original expansion (2). In [2]\nwe investigated mathematical models with B(u) having a few number of isolated branch\npoint singularities, and real values of a. The numerical results confirm that the expansion\n(2) in powers of u gives results which deviate dramatically from the exact value for large\nN, which is typical for a divergent expansion. On the other hand, the improved series (14)\nin powers of the optimal variable led to results improving continuously with increasing\nN, and no signs of divergence appeared even at very high N. In the next Section we shall\ndiscuss the convergence of the optimal expansion of the Laplace-Borel integral, bringing\nanalytic arguments which explain the numerical results obtained in [2].\n\n3\n\nConvergence of the optimal expansion\n\nWe investigate the expansion (21) with the functions InP V (a) defined by means of the PV\nprescription (20). We consider in our discussion analytic functions B of real type, i.e.\nwhich satisfy B \u2217 (u) = B(u\u2217 ), where u\u2217 is the complex conjugate of u. Therefore, the\ncoefficients bn in the expansion (2), as well as the coefficients cn in the expansion (14) are\nreal.\nThe contribution to (20) of integral along the contour C+ can be written as\nIn+ (a)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ne\u2212Fn (u) du ,\n\n(22)\n\nC+\n\nwhere\nFn (u) =\n\nu\n\u2212 n ln w(u) .\na\n5\n\n(23)\n\n\fWe evaluate the integral (22) for large n by applying the method of steepest descent [12],\n[14]. The saddle points are given by the equation\n1\nw \u2032 (u)\n=\n,\nw(u)\nan\n\n(24)\n\nwhich has four solutions, having at large n the form\n1 + i\u221a\n1 \u2212 i\u221a\n\u22121 + i \u221a\n\u22121 \u2212 i \u221a\nan , 1/4 an ,\nan ,\nan .\n1/4\n1/4\n2\n2\n2\n21/4\n\n(25)\n\nOf interest for the evaluation of (22) is the point\n\u221a\nu0 = 2\u22121/4 (1 + i) an = |u0 |ei\u03b1\n\n(26)\n\nwith\n\n\u03c0 \u03c8\n+ ,\n(27)\n4\n2\nwhich is situated in the first quadrant of the u-plane. Indeed, since the phase \u03c8 of the\nparameter a satisfies the condition (9), then Reu0 > 0 and Imu0 > 0.\nNear the saddle point Fn (u) can be expanded as\nq\n\n|u0 | = 21/4 |a|n ,\n\n\u03b1=\n\n1\nFn (u) = Fn (u0 ) + Fn\u2032\u2032 (u0 )(u \u2212 u0 )2 + ... .\n2\n\n(28)\n\n\u221a\nBy using the\u221aexpansion\nof\nw(u)\nfor\nlarge\nu\nin\nthe\nupper\nhalf\nplane\n(\nw\n\u2248\n\u03b6(1\n\u2212\ni\n2/u),\n\u221a\nwhere \u03b6 = ( 2 + i)/( 2 \u2212 i)), we obtain after a straightfoward calculation\n23/4 i\n\u221a\n1\u2212\n(1 + i) an\n\ne\u2212Fn (u0 ) \u2248 \u03b6 n\nand\n\nFn\u2032\u2032 (u0 ) \u2248\nwhere\n\nTherefore (22) becomes\n\n!n\n\n\u221an Z\n\nn \u221223/4 (1+i)\n\n\u2248\u03b6 e\n\na\n\na\n\n\u03b2=\u2212\n\ne\u2212\n\n\u221an\n\n3/4 (1+i)\n\n\u2248 \u03b6 n e\u22122\n\n21/4 (1 \u2212 i)\n\u221a\n= |Fn\u2032\u2032 (u0 )|ei\u03b2 ,\nna3\n\n23/4\n|Fn\u2032\u2032 (u0 )| = q\n,\nn|a|3\n\nIn+ (a)\n\n\u221an\n\n\u22121/4 (1+i)\n\ne\u22122\n\na\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\n\u03c0 3\u03c8\n\u2212\n.\n4\n2\n\n\u2032\u2032 (u )|\n|Fn\n0\n2\n\nei\u03b2 (u\u2212u0 )2\n\ndu .\n\n(31)\n\nC+\n\nIn order to evaluate the integral we first rotate the contour C+ in the trigonometric\ndirection in the upper half-plane, until it becomes a line passing through the origin and\nthe saddle point u0 . The rotation is possible since B(u) (and therefore also w) has no\nsingularities outside the real axis, and the arc of the circle at infinity gives a vanishing\n\n6\n\n\fcontribution, as can be easily verified. Along the rotated line u = ei\u03b1 t, where \u03b1 is the\nphase of u0 defined in (27) and t is real, so the integral in (31) becomes\nei\u03b1\n\nZ\u221e\n0\n\n\u2212\n\ne\n\nh\n\n\u2032\u2032 (u )|\n|Fn\n0\n2\n\nei(2\u03b1+\u03b2) (t\u2212|u0 |)2\n\ni\n\ndt .\n\n(32)\n\nSince cos(2\u03b1 +\u03b2) > 0 for \u03c8 satisfying the condition (9), the integration axis lies in the two\nvalleys near the saddle point u0 . Therefore it can be deformed into the path of steepest\ndescent through u0 , without passing outside the valleys. We take the integral along the\npath going to infinity\nq\nu \u2212 u0 \u2248 2/|Fn\u2032\u2032 (u0 )| e\u2212i\u03b2/2 \u03c1\n(33)\n\nwith real \u03c1. The phase of (u \u2212 u0 )2 exactly compensates the phase of Fn\u2032\u2032 (u0 ), making\n2\nthe exponent of the integrand in (31) real. The integrand can be written as e\u2212\u03c1 and the\nintegral done explicitly gives\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2212i\u03b2/2\ne\n\u03c0\n+\nn \u221223/4 (1+i) n\na q\n,\n(34)\nIn (a) \u2248 \u03b6 e\n|F \u2032\u2032(u0 )|/2 2\nn\n\ni.e. up to a constant independent of n\n1\n\n\u221an\n\n3/4 (1+i)\n\nIn+ (a) \u2248 n 4 \u03b6 n e\u22122\n\na\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nIt is important to note that the path of steepest descent must not cross the real axis,\nwhere B(u) has singularities. From (33) this implies \u2212\u03b2/2 = \u03c0/8 + 3\u03c8/4 > 0 which\nwrites as\n\u03c0\n(36)\n\u03c8>\u2212 .\n6\nThe evaluation of the integral along the contour C\u2212 in (20) proceeds in a similar way.\nThe saddle point of interest is\nq\n\u221a\n\u03c8\n\u03c0\nu\u20320 = 2\u22121/4 (1 \u2212 i) an = 21/4 |a|n e\u2212i( 4 \u2212 2 ) ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhich satisfies Reu0 > 0 and Imu0 < 0 for \u03c8 in the range given in (9).

We rotate the contour C\u2212 in the lower half-plane up to a line\npassing through the point u\u20320, and then deform it into the steepest descent path. One can\neasily verify that this path does not cross the real axis for \u2212\u03c0/8 + 3\u03c8/4 < 0 which writes\nas\n\u03c0\n(39)\n\u03c8< .\n6\nCollecting the terms we obtain the coefficients In (a) in the PV prescription (20) as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1\n1\nn \u221223/4 (1+i) n\n\u2217 n \u221223/4 (1\u2212i) n\na\na .\n4\n4\nIn (a) \u2248 n \u03b6 e\n+ n (\u03b6 ) e\n(40)\n7\n\n\fIn order to examine the convergence of the expansion (21), we consider the ratio\ncn In (a)\n,\ncn\u22121 In\u22121 (a)\n\n(41)\n\nfor large n. If the coefficients cn do not grow too rapidly, i.e.\n|cn | < Ce\u01ebn\n\n1/2\n\n,\n\n(42)\n\nfor all \u01eb > 0, then the expansion (21) converges for a complex in the domain\nRe[(1 \u00b1 i)a\u22121/2 ] > 0 .\n\n(43)\n\nAs we already discussed these conditions are equivalent to (9). If the coefficients cn behave\nat large n like\n1/2\n|cn | \u2248 ecn\n(44)\nfor some positive c, then the expansion (21) converges in the domain\nRe[(1 \u00b1 i)a\u22121/2 + c] > 0 ,\n\n(45)\n\nwhile for coefficients cn which grow faster than exp(cn1/2 ) the new series (21) is also\ndivergent. We mention that such a behaviour is not excluded in general for series of the\nform (14) with a radius of convergence equal to 1 [14].\nWe recall however that the expression (40) is valid only for \u03c8 which satisfy the conditions (36) and (39), i.e.\n\u03c0\n|\u03c8| < ,\n(46)\n6\nwhich define a sector in the a- complex plane (we recall that \u03c8 is the phase of a). This\ninequality is a condition of applicability of the steepest descent method used by us. We\nfound therefore that the expansion (21), improved by the optimal conformal mapping of\nthe Borel plane, is convergent if the Taylor coefficients cn of the expansion (14) satisfy\nthe condition (42), at least inside the sector (46) of the complex plane of a, or, if they\nbehave like (44), in the smallest of the domains (45) and (46). For the Adler function in\nmassless QCD, using (10) we write the condition (46) in the form\n1\n|s|\n|\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6| < \u221a ln 2 ,\n3 \u039bV\n\n(47)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the phase of s and we have |s| > \u039b2V . For the minkowskian quantities, from\n(11) we obtain\n1\n\u03c0\u0101 < \u221a ,\n(48)\n3\nwhich means in particular that for the\n\u221a \u03c4 - hadronic decay rate the expansion defined as in\n2\n(21) is convergent for \u03b1s (m\u03c4 ) < 4/(9 3) \u2248 0.257.\nThe behaviour of the coefficients cn depends on the singularities of B(w). By the\nconformal mapping (13) all the renormalons are situated on the circle |w| = 1, appearing\n8\n\n\fin conjugate pairs since B(u) is of real type. Assuming that all the singularities are poles\nor branch points, cn has the generic form\ncn \u2248\n\nX\n1\nrj pj (pj + 1)(pj + 2)...(pj + n)ei\u03b2j \u03b3j (pj +n) ,\nRe\nn!\nj\n\n(49)\n\nwhere exp(\u00b1i\u03b2j ) denote the position of the renormalon in the w-plane, rj the residue,\nand pj the exponent of the singularity. In Ref. [2] we investigated simple models with a\nfinite number of singularities, and real values of the parameter a, for which the conditions\nof convergence are satisfied. In the physical case, one knows only that for the first UV\nrenormalon \u03b11 = \u03c0 and p1 = 2\u03b31 , and for the first IR renormalon \u03b12 = 0 and p2 = 2\u03b32.\nIn the large \u03b20 case, as seen from (12), all the singularities are poles, pj in (49) is independent of j, and rj are known. In this case the condition of convergence (42) is satisfied.\nTherefore, the optimal expansion on the Laplace-Borel integral, in the PV prescription,\nfor the summation of one renormalon chains in the large \u03b20 limit, is convergent, at least\nin the sector of the complex a plane defined by the condition (46).\nIn conclusion, we investigated the expansion of the Laplace- Borel integral in perturbative QCD, improved by the analytic continuation of the Borel transform outside the\nperturbative convergence disk (and, simultaneously, by reaching the fastest convergence\nrate) by means of the optimal conformal mapping [2]. The convergence properties of the\nnew expansion depend on the strength of the singularities of the Borel transform, reflected\nin the behaviour of the Taylor coefficients of the expansion (14). If the Taylor coefficients\nsatisfy the condition (42), the new expansion of the Laplace- Borel integral converges\nin the sector of the complex plane of the coupling a defined by (46). The conditions are\nsatisfied in the case of the resummation of one-loop renormalons in the large- \u03b20 limit. We\nmention that in the region where the series converges the function I(a) must be analytic.\nFor the Adler function in the complex momentum plane this corresponds to the region\ndescribed by Eq. (47), where D(s) is analytic.\n\nAcknowledgements: One of us (I.C.) thanks Prof. S.
