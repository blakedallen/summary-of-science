Later he corrected the mistake in\nanother publication, but unfortunately his incorrect solution is more\nwidely known than his correction. In fact, a Tuesday-Child variation\nof this problem went viral in 2010, and the same flaw keeps reappearing in solutions for that problem as well. In this article, I would\nlike to popularize Martin Gardner's correction and conduct a detailed\ndiscussion of the new problem.\n\n1\n\nMartin Gardner\n\nMartin Gardner's writing is amazingly accurate and reliable. The fact that\nhe made a mistake is simply a testimonial to the difficulty of the problem.\n\n1.1\n\nTwo-Children Problem\n\nThe following problem appeared in Martin Gardner's Scientific American\ncolumn in 1959. It was later republished in his book The Second Scientific\nAmerican Book of Mathematical Puzzles and Diversions [3] in the chapter\n\"Nine More Problems:\"\nMr. Smith has two children. At least one of them is a boy. What\nis the probability that both children are boys?\nMr. Jones has two children. The older child is a girl. What is\nthe probability that both children are girls?\n1\n\n\fThere was never any controversy about Mr. Jones who with probability\n1/2 has two girls, so we will just ignore him and his two kids. Instead, we\nwill concentrate on Mr. Smith. Here's the solution that Martin Gardner\npublished together with the problem:\nIf Smith has two children, at least on of which is a boy, we have\nthree equally probable cases: Boy-boy, Boy-girl, Girl-boy. In only\none case are both children boys, so the probability that both are\nboys is 1/3.\n\n1.2\n\nThe Corrected Solution\n\nLater he wrote a column titled \"Probability and Ambiguity,\" which was\nrepublished in the same book as the original puzzle [3]. In this column he\ncomes back to Mr. Smith, correcting himself:\n... the answer depends on the procedure by which the information\n\"at least one is a boy\" is obtained.\nHe suggested two potential procedures.\n(i) Pick all the families with two children, one of which is a boy. If Mr.\nSmith is chosen randomly from this list, then the answer is 1/3.\n(ii) Pick a random family with two children; suppose the father is Mr.\nSmith. Then if the family has two boys, Mr. Smith says, \"At least one\nof them is a boy.\" If he has two girls, he says, \"At least one of them is\na girl.\" If he has a boy and a girl he flips a coin to say one or another\nof those two sentences. In this case the probability that both children\nare the same sex is 1/2.\nThus, the original problem without a specified procedure is ambiguous.\n\n1.3\n\nMore Procedures\n\nI call the first procedure \"boy-centered,\" because from the start we know\nthat we are talking about boys. Correspondingly, the second procedure is\ncalled \"gender neutral.\"\n\n2\n\n\fMartin Gardner wanted to emphasize that the problem is ambiguous and\nfor him it was enough to show two different procedures leading to two different\nanswers. However, there could be many procedures. Let me just suggest two\nmore procedures that demonstrate the full range of ambiguity.\n(i) Suppose that Mr. Smith wants to brag about his sons and will always\nmention as many as he can. In this case the procedure might be the\nfollowing:\nIf he has two boys, he says, \"I have two boys.\" If he has one son, he\nsays \"At least one of them is a boy.\" In this case the answer to the\nproblem is 0.\n(ii) Suppose Mr. Smith doesn't like boys, and wants to de-emphasize the\nnumber of boys he has. In this case the procedure might be the following:\nIf he has two boys, he says, \"At least one of them is a boy.\" If he has a\nboy and a girl, he says, \"I am the proud father of a girl.\" In this case\nthe answer is 1.\nI leave it to the reader to invent a procedure for any answer between 0\nand 1.\n\n2\n\nTuesday-Child Problem\n\nNow we fast-forward to 2010. Gary Foshee gave a very short talk at the 9th\nGathering for Gardner. He said:\nI have two children. One is a boy born on a Tuesday. What is\nthe probability that I have two boys?\nThis is Martin Gardner's Two-Children problem with an extra twist.\nBefore discussing the solution, let us agree on some basic assumptions:\n(i) Sons and daughters are equally probable. This is not exactly true, but\nit is a reasonable approximation.\n(ii) For our purposes, twins do not exist. Not only is the proportion of\ntwins in the population small, but because they are usually born on\nthe same day, twins might complicate the calculation.\n3\n\n\f(iii) All days of the week are equally probable birthdays. While this isn't\nactually true - for example, assisted labors are unlikely to be scheduled\nfor weekends - it is a reasonable approximation.\n\n2.1\n\nWrong Solution\n\nHistory repeats itself. Just as occurred around the classical Two-Children\nproblem, many mathematicians have been fighting for the wrong solution.\nThis is their argument:\nEach child can be one of two genders and can be born on one of seven\ndays of the week. Thus, gender and the day present 14 equally probable\ncases for each child. That in turn makes each two-children family belong to\none of 196 equally probable cases. When we restrict all possible cases to the\ngiven information that one of the children is a boy born on a Tuesday we get\n27 equally probable cases. We can divide these cases into several groups, as\nfollows:\n\u2022 7 cases, where the first child is a son born on a Tuesday and the second\nchild is a daughter.\n\u2022 7 cases, where the second child is a son born on a Tuesday and the first\nchild is a daughter.\n\u2022 6 cases, where the first child is a son born on a Tuesday and the second\nchild is a son not born on a Tuesday.\n\u2022 6 cases, where the second child is a son born on a Tuesday and the first\nchild is a son not born on a Tuesday.\n\u2022 1 case, where both children are sons born on a Tuesday.\nThere is a total of 27 equally probable cases, 13 of which correspond to\ntwo sons. Thus the probability must be 13/27.\nThis wrong solution was widely published. For example, Keith Devlin\npublished it in his column Devlin's Angle in the article \"Probability Can\nBite\" [1]. But just like Martin Gardner, he corrected himself in the next\narticle, \"The Problem with Word Problems\" [2].\n\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\nProcedures\n\nThe ambiguity that Martin Gardner found in the Two-Children problem is\nlikewise present in the Tuesday-Child problem. To resolve ambiguity, we\nneed to specify the procedure by which the information was obtained. Let\nme discuss four procedures. The calculation is based on 196 equally probable\ncases for different combinations of gender and the day of the week.\nGender-Neutral, Day-of-the-Week-Neutral Procedure\nIn this scenario, a father of two children is picked at random. He is instructed\nto choose a child by flipping a coin. Then he has to provide true information\nabout the chosen child in the following format: \"I have a son/daughter born\non Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri/Sat/Sun.\" If his statement is, \"I have a son born\non a Tuesday,\" what is the probability that the other child is also a son?\nThe solution for this procedure is the following: A father has two daughters in 49 cases. Such a father will make the above statement with probability\nzero. A father has a son and a daughter in 98 cases, and will produce the\nabove statement with a probability of 1/14: with a probability of 1/2 the\nson is chosen over the daughter and with a probability of 1/7 Tuesday is the\nbirthday. A father has two sons in 49 cases, and he will make the statement\nwith a probability of 1/7. The father of two sons is twice as likely to make\nthe statement as the father of a son and a daughter, but there are half as\nmany such fathers. Thus the probability is 1/2 that the other child is also a\nson.\nThis is the most symmetric scenario, which produces the most symmetric\nanswer.\nBoy-Centered, Day-of-the-Week-Neutral Procedure\nNow let us consider the second scenario. A father of two children is picked at\nrandom. If he has two daughters he is sent home and another father picked\nat random until one is found who has at least one son. If he has one son,\nhe is instructed to provide true information on his son's day of birth. If he\nhas two sons, he has to choose one son at random. His statement will be,\n\"I have a son born on Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri/Sat/Sun.\" If his statement\nis, \"I have a son born on a Tuesday,\" what is the probability that the other\nchild is also a son?\n\n5\n\n\fThe solution is as follows. A father has a son and a daughter in 98 cases,\nand he will produce the statement above with a probability of 1/7. If he has\ntwo sons (49 cases), the probability of the statement above will likewise be\n1/7. The father of two sons is exactly as likely to make the statement as\nthe father of a son and a daughter, but there are half as many such fathers.\nThus the probability is 1/3 that the other child is also a son.\nThis scenario corresponds to the original procedure leading to the first\nsolution of Martin Gardner's Two-Children problem. Unsurprisingly, the\nanswer is the same.\nBoy-Centered, Tuesday-Centered Procedure\nNow let us consider the third scenario. A father of two children is picked\nat random. If he doesn't have a son born on a Tuesday, he is sent home\nand another father is picked at random until one who has a son born on\na Tuesday is found. He is instructed to tell you, \"I have a son born on a\nTuesday.\" What is the probability that the other child is also a son?\nHere is the solution. A father of a boy and a girl has a son born on a\nTuesday in 14 cases. He will make the statement in question with a probability of 1. A father of two sons has a son born on a Tuesday in 13 cases. He\ntoo is guaranteed to make the statement. Thus the probability is 13/27 that\nthe other child is a son.\nThis procedure corresponds to the procedure many mathematicians assume while solving the Tuesday-Child problem. This assumption, made implicitly, is the source of the erroneous solution.\nGender-Neutral, Tuesday-Centered Procedure\nFor completeness let us consider the fourth scenario. A father of two children\nis picked at random. If he doesn't have a child who is born on a Tuesday,\nhe is sent home and another father is picked at random until one who has\na child born on a Tuesday is found. He is instructed to tell you, \"I have\na son/daughter born on a Tuesday.\" If both of his children were born on\nTuesdays, he has to pick one at random. If his statement is, \"I have a son\nborn on a Tuesday,\" what is the probability that the other child is also a\nson?\nHere is the solution. A father of two daughters will have a child born on a\nTuesday in 13 cases. He makes the statement in question with a probability\n6\n\n\fof 0. A father of a boy and a girl has a child born on a Tuesday in 26 cases.\nThe probability that he makes the statement is 1/2. A father of two sons will\nhave a son born on a Tuesday in 13 cases. The probability that he makes\nthe statement is 1. The father of two sons is twice as likely to make the\nstatement as the father of a son and a daughter, but there are half as many\nsuch fathers. Thus the probability is 1/2 that the other child is also a son.\nIn this procedure we added an additional constraint on the families with\ntwo children - that a child was born on a Tuesday - that doesn't correlate\nwith gender. Not surprisingly, the answer in this case is 1/2.\n\n2.3\n\nCorrect Solution\n\nNow let's go back to the original problem. Suppose you meet your friend\nwho you know has two children and he tells you, \"I have a son born on a\nTuesday.\" What is the probability that the other child is also a son?\nThe problem is under-defined. The solution depends on the reason the\nfather mentions only the son and only the Tuesday.\nThe funny part of this story is that I, Tanya Khovanova, have two children. And the following statement is true: \"I have a son born on a Tuesday.\"\nWhat is the probability that my other child is a son?\n\n3\n\nGender Bias\n\nWhat puzzles me is that I've never run into a similar problem about daughters\nor mothers. I've discussed the original math problem about Mr. Smith with\nmany people many times. But I kept stumbling upon men who passionately\ndefended their wrong solution. When I dug into why their solution was\nwrong, it appeared that they implicitly assumed that if a man has a daughter\nand a son, he won't bother talking about his daughter at all.\nI've heard this so often that I began to wonder if gender bias wasn't the\nunderlying source of the wrong solution.\nNow we have a Tuesday-Child problem. What encourages me is that\nthe most common mistake is that people choose the boy-centered, Tuesdaycentered solution. I do not anticipate a strong bias for Tuesday, so perhaps\nafter all it's not a gender bias but simply a mistake.\nOn second thought, in the father's statement there is a symmetry between\ngenders and days of the week. Why is everyone asking about the gender of\n7\n\n\fthe other child, not about the birth day?\nI have yet to see people fighting over the following problem.\nYou run into an old friend. He has two children, but you do\nnot know what their gender is. He says, \"I have a son born on\na Tuesday.\" What is the probability that his other child is also\nborn on a Tuesday?\nReal gender equality will be reached when mathematicians start arguing\nabout the probability of the second birthday being Tuesday with the same\npassion as the probability of the other child being a boy.\n\n4\n\nJack\n\nI have had to defend the solution - that the problem is ambiguous - so\nmany times that I invented a fictional opponent, Jack, and here is my imaginary conversation with him.\nJack: The probability that a father with two sons has a son born on a\nTuesday is 13/49. The probability that a father with a son and a daughter\nhas a son born on a Tuesday is 1/7. A dad with a son and a daughter is\nencountered twice as often as a dad with just two sons. Hence, we have\nprobabilities of 13/49 and 14/49, and the probability of the father having a\nsecond son is 13/(13 + 14), or 13/27.\nMe: What if the problem is about Wednesday?\nJack: It doesn't matter. The particular day in question was random. The\nanswer should be the same: 13/27.\nMe: Suppose the father says, \"I have a son born on *day.\" He mumbles\nthe day, so you do not hear it exactly.\nJack: Well, as the answer is the same for any day, it shouldn't matter.\nThe probability that his other child will also be a son is still 13/27.\nMe: Suppose he says, \"I have a son born . . .\". So he might have continued\nand mentioned the day, he might not have. What is the probability?\nJack: We already decided that it doesn't depend on the day, so it shouldn't\nmatter. The probability is still 13/27.\nMe: Suppose he says, \"I have a son and I do not remember when he\nwas born.\" Isn't that the same as just saying, \"I have a son.\" And by your\narguments the probability that his other child is also a son is 13/27.\n8\n\n\fJack: Hmm.\nMe: Do you remember your calculation? If we denote the number of days\nin a week as d, then the probability that he has another son is (2d\u22121)/(4d\u22121).\nMy point is that this probability depends on the number of days in a week.\nSo, if tomorrow we change a week length to another number his probability\nof having a son changes. Right?\nAt this point my imaginary conversation stops and I do not know whether\nI have convinced Jack or not.\n\n5\n\nUnambiguous Problem\n\nNow let me give you a variation of the Tuesday-Child problem that is unambiguous and where the answer is 13/27:\nYou pick a random father of two children and ask him, \"Yes or\nno, do you have a son born on a Tuesday?\" Let's make a leap\nand assume that all fathers know the days of the births of their\nchildren and that they answer truthfully. If the answer is yes,\nwhat is the probability that the father has two sons?\nThe 13/27 argument works perfectly in this case.\nThe reason this problem stops being ambiguous is that the exact procedure of how you get your information is provided.\n\n6\n\nBack to Gardner\n\nMany people I argued with didn't want to listen to me. They referred to Martin Gardner as the final authority to support their wrong solution. Gardner\nwas a great thinker, and he corrected his mistake.
