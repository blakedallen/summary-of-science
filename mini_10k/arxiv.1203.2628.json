Here we investigate the effect of surface\ndisorder beyond the weak-disorder limit using large-scale numerical simulations. We find two qualitatively distinct regimes: Moderate disorder destroys the Dirac cone and induces diffusive metallic\nbehavior at the surface. Even more remarkably, for strong surface disorder a Dirac cone reappears,\nas new weakly disordered \"surface\" states emerge in the sample beneath the disordered surface layer,\nwhich can be understood in terms of an interface between a topological and an Anderson insulator.\nTogether, this demonstrates the drastic effect of disorder on topological surface states, which cannot\nbe captured within effective two-dimensional models for the surface states alone.\n\nTopological insulators (TIs) are a novel form of insulators, where topological properties of the band structure lead to the formation of metallic states at the surface [1, 2]. Two-dimensional (2d) TIs were predicted\n[3, 4] and then realized in quantum-well heterostructures\n[5]. Subsequently, three-dimensional (3d) generalizations\nwere discussed theoretically [6\u20138] and realized afterwards,\nprimarily in Bi-based compounds [9, 10]. 3d TIs are characterized by a set of topological quantum numbers, which\nlead to a classification into strong and weak TIs.\nStrong TIs possess low-energy surface states which can\nbe described in terms of massless 2d Dirac electrons, with\nan odd number of Dirac cones per surface. Remarkably,\nthese surface states are topologically protected against\nthe influence of disorder due to their helical nature: The\nspin\u2013momentum locking of the Dirac theory implies that\nthe states ~k and \u2212~k have opposite spin. This in turn suppresses the lowest-order matrix element for backscattering, ~k \u2192 \u2212~k, leading to the absence of weak localization\nfor weak potential disorder. What about strong disorder? Theoretical results obtained within 2d continuum\nDirac models suggest that such states remain metallic\neven for arbitrarily large disorder: The beta-function describing the renormalization-group flow of the conductivity is always positive [11\u201313]. However, by construction\nthe applicability of these effective theories to TI surface\nstates is restricted to energies much smaller than the bulk\ngap, \u2206, and the effect of surface disorder with a strength\n\u03b3 & \u2206 can therefore not be captured. Intuitively, this is\nbecause strong impurities will influence both surface and\nbulk states, causing a non-trivial coupling between the\ntwo which cannot be described by a theory for surface\nstates alone.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the effect of strong surface disorder has only been discussed locally for isolated\nimpurities [14], but the global fate of TI surface states\nunder moderate or strong disorder is not known. This\nissue is not only of fundamental interest in order to un-\n\nderstand the range and limitations of \"topological protection\", but is also of enormous practical relevance: Impurity potentials can easily be in the energy range of\n1 eV, thereby exceeding typical band gaps of 3d TIs, e.g.\n0.3 eV for Bi2 Se3 . Moreover, surfaces are often intrinsically disordered, and in addition can be easily disordered\nintentionally to perform controlled studies of disorder effects. Therefore, non-perturbative theoretical studies of\nsurface disorder are clearly called for.\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the\neffect of surface disorder on 3d TIs by means of large-scale\nnumerical simulations of a 3d lattice model. Our central\nresults can be summarized as follows: Topological protection is only operative for disorder strengths which are\nsmall compared to the bulk gap, \u03b3 \u226a \u2206. For moderate\ndisorder, \u03b3 \u223c \u2206, the surface layer instead shows diffusive metallic behavior, and the momentum-space Diraclike structure of its states is lost. Moreover, low-energy\nstates start to significantly penetrate into the sample.\nFor strong disorder, \u03b3 \u226b \u2206, states in the surface layer\nbecome strongly localized, but new weakly disordered\nmetallic states appear which reside primarily in the first\ninward layer of the sample. Remarkably, these states display a clear Dirac dispersion, suggesting that they can be\ninterpreted as metallic states at the interface between a\nTI and a strong Anderson insulator (AI).\nOur calculations demonstrate that already moderate\ndisorder on TI surfaces requires to consider physics beyond effective 2d Dirac models. On the application side,\nwe propose that strong disorder can be used for nanostructuring of TI devices: Disordered layers in a TI crystal\nact as atomic-scale barriers which cut the TI.\nModel and Methods. As a minimal model for a 3d TI we\ntake four bands in a cubic lattice of N sites, which may\nalso be considered as an effective model for strained 3d\nHgTe and for insulators of the Bi2 Se3 family [6, 15, 16].\nThe Hamiltonian can conveniently be expressed in terms\nof the identity, \u03930 and four Dirac matrices \u0393a , \u0393(1,2,3,4) =\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c9 /t\n\n6\n\n6\n\na)\n\n\u03b3 =0\n\n6\n\nb)\n\n\u03b3 =t\n\n6\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\n\u03b3 = 5t\n\n\u03b3 = 20t\n\nA( k ,\u03c9 )\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22122\n\n10 2\n\n10 1\n\n10 0\nXz\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22126\nXz Xx\n\n\u22126\nXz Xx\n\n\u22126\nXz Xx\n\nkz\n\n\u2212\u03c0 /a\n\n\u22126\nXx\n\nM\n\nR\n\nk\n\n\u0393\n\nM\n\nR\n\nk\n\n\u0393\n\nM\n\nR\n\nk\n\n\u0393\n\nM\n\nR\n\nk\n\n\u0393\n\n\u0393\n\nkx\n\nM\nR\nXx\n\n\u03c0 /a\n\nky\n\nXz\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Spectral function A(~k, \u03c9), Eq.

In Fig. 1, we\nstart by presenting results for A(~k, \u03c9) along a path following the high-symmetry directions of the bulk Brillouin\nzone. In the clean case, Fig. 1a, bulk states exist at energies |\u03c9| \u2265 t, and sub-gap surface states are clearly visible:\nFor the model (1) with m = 2t the Dirac cone is located\nat the surface momentum \u0393s = (0, 0) and consequently\nshows up in A(~k, \u03c9) at 3d momenta ~k which equal \u0393s after projection onto the respective surface, e.g., at \u0393 [18].\nWhile for weak surface disorder, Fig. 1b, the spectral function has changed rather little (apart from minor\nbroadening effects), the picture is drastically altered for\nmoderate disorder in Fig. 1c, where for \u03b3 = 5t the typical\n\u01ebn is somewhat larger than the bulk gap. As expected,\nthe bulk states are well defined, but any sub-gap states\nhave lost their momentum-space structure. As will become clear below, the surface states have acquired diffusive character. Finally, Fig. 1d is astonishing, as it shows\nthat sub-gap states with a well-defined Dirac dispersion\nre-appear for strong surface disorder, \u03b3 = 20t.\nLocal density of states.

While the clean case a) has sizeable lowenergy LDOS only on the outer layer, weight is distributed to\nthe inner layers with increasing disorder. For strong surface\ndisorder, panel f), the broad distribution for the outer layer\nindicates localization, while disorder effects are much weaker\non the high-intensity first inward layer. In contrast, for bulk\ndisorder the broad LDOS distribution essentially coincides for\nall layers (surface states are destroyed) and indicates diffusive\nmetallic behavior in c) and localization in f).\n\nonly weakly perturbed for \u03b3 = t, Figs. 2b and 3b, consistent with topological protection (although the weight on\nthe first inward layer is seen to increase).\nModerate surface disorder, \u03b3 = 5t, significantly redistributes part of the weight of the in-gap states from\nthe surface to the first inward layer (and even to the\nsecond inward layer), Figs. 2c and 3d. Moreover, the\nstates become inhomogeneous, and the LDOS distribution significantly broadens. These are clear signatures\nof diffusive metallic behavior \u2013 this appears consistent\nwith the fact that a 3d TI under influence of moderate\nbulk disorder becomes a diffusive metal [19, 20]. (The\nlatter is nicely visible in Fig. 3c, which shows disordered\nlow-energy states in all layers for a bulk \u03b3 = 5t.) We conclude that, for surface disorder, low-energy surface states\ndo exist for \u03b3 = 5t, but their momentum-space Dirac\nstructure is lost, consistent with Fig. 1c.\nWe now turn to strong surface disorder, \u03b3 = 20t. Here,\nthe main weight of the low-energy states has been pushed\ninto the sample (!) to the first inward layer, Fig. 3f. In\ncontrast, the LDOS in the surface layer is small with\na very broad distribution, corresponding to the \"fragmented\" real-space structure in Fig. 2d. The surface\nlayer thus shows a clear tendency towards strong Anderson localization. (This conclusion is again supported\nby the corresponding result for bulk disorder, Fig. 3e,\nsignalling bulk AI behavior [24].) At the same time, the\nfirst inward layer displays a much narrower LDOS distribution, i.e., is only weakly affected by disorder (recall\nthat the \u01ebn are zero here). Together with the data in\nFig. 1d, this shows that metallic low-energy states have\nemerged in the first inward layer and exhibit a welldefined Dirac structure in momentum space, much like\n\n\f4\n\u03b3=t\n\u03c9 =t \u03c9 =0\n\ndisordered layer\n\ny\nx\n\n\u03c9 =t \u03c9 =0\n\n\u03b3 = 20t\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\nz\nFigure 4: (Color online) Spatially resolved LDOS at energies \u03c9 = 0 and t for a 16 \u00d7 16 \u00d7 33 sample with both surface and\nmidplane disorder, for disorder strengths \u03b3 = t (top) and \u03b3 = 20t (bottom). The individual panels show the LDOS slice-by-slice\nfor the entire sample. While weak disorder leaves the physics of the clean sample untouched, strong disorder leads to localization\non the surfaces and in the midplane, and new weakly disordered sub-gap states appear both in layers 2 and 32 and in layers 16\nand 18 adjacent to the midplane: The disordered midplane has cut the TI into two.\n\nthe surface states of the clean sample. The situation thus\ncan be interpreted as an interface between a TI and an\nAI (which here consists of the surface layer only), with\nTI interface states forming in the outermost layer of the\nclean TI.\nIn the limit of large \u03b3, the behavior can be rationalized by noting that the surface sites with |\u01ebn | \u226b t effectively decouple from the bulk, their only effect being to\nintroduce an effective disorder in the first inward layer of\nstrength t2 /\u03b3, i.e., a smaller TI with weak surface disorder obtains.\nRelation to surface Dirac theories. Given the drastic\neffects of disorder on TI surface states, a comment on\ndisorder effects in 2d Dirac theories is in order. Recent\nwork [11\u201313] has shown that even strong disorder cannot\nlocalize electrons of a single Dirac cone, which has lead\nto the notion of a supermetal and self-organized criticality in the presence of interactions. However, these\ntheories are constructed in the continuum such that the\ncutoff energy of the Dirac spectrum is the largest energy\nscale. Therefore lattice effects are not captured, and it is\nprecisely lattice effects which are responsible for strong\nlocalization in the limit of strong on-site disorder. (For\nTIs, such lattice effects include the coupling to sites away\nfrom the surface layer.)\nWe conclude that the applicability of 2d Dirac theories\nto TI surface states is limited to energy scales small compared to the bulk gap \u2206, and thus our results are not in\ncontradiction to those of Refs. 11, 12. Parenthetically, we\nnote that attempts to study 2d lattice models with a single Dirac cone are usually hampered by the fermion doubling problem which can only be circumvented in special\ncases with broken time-reversal symmetry [25]. Therefore, treating the full 3d model as done here is indispensible.\nMidplane disorder: How to cut a TI. We can use the\ninsights gained above for an \"experiment\": If a single\n\nstrongly disordered layer, simulating an AI, produces new\nDirac interfaces states in the TI, this can be used to effectively cut a TI. To this end, we introduce on-site disorder\nselectively in one central layer (or midplane) of the TI,\nFig. 4. If this disorder is strong, \u03b3 = 20t, the midplane\nshows signatures of Anderson localization, and new lowenergy states appear to the left and right of the midplane.\nFrom Fig. 4 one can deduce that these layers show the\nsame characteristics as the layers adjacent to the disordered surfaces.\nOur simulated sample thus represents a layered structure AI\u2013TI\u2013AI\u2013TI\u2013AI (the two outer AI on the sample\nsurface), with interface states bounding both pieces of\nTI. (We have checked that the properties remain robust\nif the number of disordered layers is increased.) This\nsuggests efficient nanostructuring via disorder: A large\nTI crystal can be \"cut\" into multiple TIs, preserving the\nsingle-crystalline structure, by intentionally disordering a\nfew atomic layers, e.g., via irradiation, which then form\nbarriers with new interface states.\nConclusions. By large-scale numerics we have demonstrated that surface disorder can strongly disturb surface\nstates of 3d TIs, such that their description in terms of\na 2d Dirac theory breaks down: Topological protection\nis only relevant for weak disorder, while disorder with a\nstrength comparable to or larger than the bulk gap first\nleads to diffusive metallic behavior and then to Anderson localization at the surface. In the latter case, the\nemerging interface between a TI and an AI comes with\nnew low-energy interface states, with properties similar\nto the surface states of a clean TI interfacing vacuum \u2013\nthe physics of these interface states clearly deserves further studies.\nSTM experiments have already detected strong perturbations of surface states by isolated impurities [26], and\nexperiments on more disordered surfaces can be used to\nconfirm our predictions.\n\n\f5\nWe thank A.
