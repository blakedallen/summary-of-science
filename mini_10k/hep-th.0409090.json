Their existence is crucial for the concinnity of duality symmetries of\nstring theories [1]. BPS string junctions preserve a quarter of the original supersymmetry (SUSY). String\njunction solutions have been obtained and used in a variety of situations in F-theory [2,3], M-theory [1,4]\nand string theories in ten and lower dimensions [5\u201311]. In this article we concern ourselves with such\nstates and phenomena related to them in supersymmetric field theories, realised by D-branes in string\ntheories [12\u201315].\nThe objects of interest in this article are the half-BPS dyonic states in a four dimensional N = 2\nsuper-Yang-Mills theory (SYM) with gauge group SU (2), known as the Seiberg-Witten theory [16]. It\ncan be viewed as the gauge theory on the world-volume of a D3-brane in the type-IIB string theory in the\npresence of background 7-branes. The spectrum of this theory contains dyonic states, carrying electric\nas well as magnetic charges under the gauge group, identified with appropriate RR-charges of the D3and the 7-branes in the type-IIB theory, in which the Seiberg-Witten gauge theory is embedded. Certain\nconfigurations of these dyons are interpreted as junctions in which at least three strings join at a vertex,\nwhile the other ends of the strings end of the D3-brane or the 7-branes. At the vertex the electric and the\nmagnetic charges of the strings are balanced, as in electrical circuits, rendering the configuration neutral.\nIn a T-dual description as states in the type-IIA theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold,\nM, these states arise as even-dimensional branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in M. The SeibergWitten theory, thus, has another description in terms of wrapped even-dimensional branes in the type-IIA\ntheory. Within the scope of topological theories, these are given by branes in the topological B-model,\nalias B-branes, wrapping holomorphic cycles in M. A way of obtaining the Seiberg-Witten theory,\nknown as geometric engineering [17], produces gauge groups by compactifying the type-IIA theory on a\nsuitable Calabi-Yau manifold, then zooming into regions in its moduli space where the manifold degenerates and gravity decouples. The resulting gauge group depends on the specific manner of degeneration.\nThus, the string junctions of the Seiberg-Witten theory are interpreted as wrapped B-branes on some\nsuitable degenerate Calabi-Yau manifold.\nNow, B-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in M are described as objects in Db(M), the bounded\nderived category of coherent sheaves on M [18]. This description is valid when M is sufficiently large,\nso much so that geometric notions make sense. The branes that are stable are described in Db(M)\nby introducing a grade guided by the preservation of SUSY. The corresponding criterion for stability,\nthat is, between two configurations of branes the one with a lower grade is more stable, is called \u03a0stability. Altering the coupling in the Seiberg-Witten theory corresponds to perambulating the K\u00e4hlermoduli space of M, whereby the set of \u03a0-stable objects in Db(M) mutate giving way to different\nsets of stable objects in different regions. In the limit appropriate for deploying geometric engineering\ntechniques, the spectrum of dyonic states in the Seiberg-Witten theory with N = 2 SUSY arise from the\n\u03a0-stable B-branes [19] in the weak as well as in the strong coupling regimes.\nDyons in the Seiberg-Witten gauge theory on the world-volume of a D3-brane probe are interpreted\nas string junctions in the type-IIB theory in which the gauge theory is embedded [14, 20]. Moreover,\nas one perambulates the type-IIB moduli space, the junctions go through transitions producing other\njunctions or strings. The latter, before ending on a 7-brane, spiral around the marginal stability line,\nthe line of demarkation between the weak and strong coupling regions of the gauge theory [15]. Upon\ninterpreting the dyons as the \u03a0-stable objects in Db(M), therefore, it is expected that such phenomena\n1\n\n\fcan be interpreted using \u03a0-stability. We show that this is indeed the case.\nIn the abelian category underlying the derived category Db(M), a dyon may be viewed as a bound\nstate of others, at certain points in the moduli space, according to certain projective resolutions provided\nby short exact sequences of sheaves on M, pulled back from the projective line P1 . This corresponds to\na junction with three prongs, one lying in the weak coupling region, and two in the other, with the vertex\nlying on the marginal stability line, alluded to above. This corresponds, then, to replacing a sheaf by\na projective resolution, in which the original sheaf is stable in the weak coupling region, while the two\nsheaves constituting the resolution are stable in the strong coupling region enclosed by the MS-line. In\nthe corresponding triangulated category the short exact sequences correspond to distinguished triangles.\nThus, a three-pronged junction, possibly with multiple strings per prong, corresponds to a distinguished\ntriangle in the triangulated category or a short exact sequence in the abelian category. The same dyon\nmay, at some other point in the moduli space, be viewed as a string that starts on the D3-brane and\nends on either of the 7-branes, staying always outside the line of marginal stability and possibly going\naround it several times [14]. We refer to these as spiral strings. We construct the projective resolutions\nof the sheaves in the abelian category that correspond to these spiral strings in an iterative fashion,\ncorresponding to the invertible sheaves of rank n > 1 on P1 . In the derived category, then, one can\nuse either of the resolutions to limn the dyons corresponding to a particular sheaf. We show, however,\nthat there are preferred regions in the moduli space corresponding to each of the resolutions, determined\nby the grade of \u03a0-stability. Passing from one such region to another correspond to transitions between\nstrings and junctions [15].\nThe organisation of the article is as follows. In the next section we recall a few notions related\nto \u03a0-stability and fix notations. In \u00a73 we briefly review the identification of stable sheaves on P1 as\nSeiberg-Witten dyons discovered earlier [19]. In \u00a74 we obtain the projective resolutions that correspond\nto the spiral strings illustrating them with a few examples. We then proceed to discuss the transitions\nbetween the spiral strings and the junctions before concluding.\n\n2 \u03a0-stability & dyons\nLet us start by briefly recalling the notion of \u03a0-stability. An object of the derived category Db(M) is a\ntriangle from the underlying triangulated category,\n/B\n\nA\n\n/ A[1] ,\n\n/C\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere A, B and C are complexes of coherent sheaves on M, and [n] denotes the shift functor shifting a\ncomplex toward the left by n degrees; so [1] shifts a complex by unit degree. This in turn corresponds to\nshort exact sequences of complexes in the underlying Abelian category,\n0\n\n/A\n\n/B\n\n/C\n\n/0,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich can also be thought of as a projective resolution of the object C. In order to define a grade on\nthe derived category one first defines a map from the Grothendieck group of M to the complex plane\nZ : K(M) \u2212\u2192 C, called the central charge [18, 21\u201323]. The central charge of an object E of Db(M )\nis given by\nZ\np\ne\u2212(B+iJ) ch(E) Td(M),\nZ(E) =\n(2.3)\nM\n\n2\n\n\fat the large volume asymptote, with B + iJ denoting the complexified K\u00e4hler class of M. The phase of\nthe central charge defines a grade, \u03c6(E), for every object E as\n\u03c6(E) = \u2212\n\n1\narg Z(E),\n\u03c0\n\n\u22122 < \u03c6(E) \u2264 0.\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe magnitude |Z(E)| furnishes the mass of the state. The criterion of \u03a0-stability is formulated in terms\nof the grade \u03c6. A physically meaningful description of branes corresponding to all the objects in the\ntriangle (2.1) or the exact sequence (2.2) exists if the grades satisfy\n\u03c6(B) \u2212 \u03c6(A) = 1,\n\nwith\n\n\u03c6(C) = \u03c6(B).\n\n(2.5)\n\nThis embodies the condition of alignment of charges of the branes and guarantees that the corresponding\nsolution is a BPS state in the theory preserving N = 1 SUSY. A brane corresponding to the object C\nin (2.1) is said to be stable, marginally stable or unstable with respect to decaying into A and B if\n\u03c6(B) \u2212 \u03c6(A) \u2276 1, respectively. The region of the moduli space where it is marginally stable is called\na marginal stability locus. Thus, to start with, we have a good description of topological branes on the\nmarginal stability locus. Once the marginal stability locus is ascertained, the brane corresponding to the\nobject C is stable or unstable with respect to decaying into A and B, as one moves off this locus in the\nK\u00e4hler moduli space, if \u03c6(B) \u2212 \u03c6(A) \u2212 1 is negative or positive, respectively. This criterion is called\n\u03a0-stability. In the sequel we often refer to A and B as the components of C, in the context of a specific\ntriangle.\nLet us now briefly summarise the interpretation of Seiberg-Witten dyons as \u03a0-stable objects in\nDb(M) in the geometric engineering limit [19] thereby identifying the string junctions as objects in\nDb(M). We then check how the analysis of \u03a0-stability reproduces the transitions between strings and\njunctions.\nThe pure SU (2) Seiberg-Witten theory is geometrically engineered by zooming in around the principal component of the discriminant locus of the mirror of a Calabi-Yau manifold M, which is a degree\neight hypersurface in the resolution of P4 (2, 2, 2, 1, 1). The sole compact part left of M in this limit is a\ncurve C isomorphic to the complex projective line P1 , embedded in M; \u0131 : C \u0592\u2192 M, C \u223c\n= P1 . The states\nb\nwhich become massless on the discriminant locus correspond to objects in D (M) that are pull-back\nof objects of Db(C), indicated by \u0131\u22c6 . Thus, for the purpose of studying the gauge theory, it suffices to\nconsider Db(C), whose objects are constructed out of the structure sheaf OC and the torsion sheaf Op ,\nconcentrated at a point p of the projective line, C. The spectrum of the gauge theory is envisaged as the\ncategory of stable objects in Db(M).\nIn order to study \u03a0-stability, one first identifies the pull-back of OC and Op as a D6-brane and a\nD4-brane, respectively, and associates the corresponding central charges to the corresponding complexes\nof coherent sheaves on M. Thus in the large volume asymptotic\n\u031f = Z(\u0131\u22c6 Op ),\n\n\u031fD = Z(\u0131\u22c6 OC ),\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere the periods \u031f and \u031fD are the two solutions of the Picard-Fuchs equation of M in the limit under\nconsideration. This entails the identification OM = \u0131\u22c6 OC . This provides the central charge map from\nDb(M) to the Grothendieck group of M, alluded to earlier, the latter being generated in the present\ncase by the zeroth and the second cohomology groups of C, H 0 (C, Q) and H 2 (C, Q), respectively. The\nasymptotic expression of the central charge is used to fix the periods \u031f and \u031fD in (2.6) up to a constant.\n3\n\n\fFurthermore, the monodromies around the points z = \u00b11 and z = \u221e fix the periods \u031f and \u031fD to the\nSeiberg-Witten periods [15, 16, 24], up to an overall constant [19]. Generally, the central charge of an\nobject E of C(M), the category of complexes underlying the derived category Db(M), can be written\nas\nZ(E) = m\u031fD + n\u031f,\n(2.7)\n\u0001\n\u0001\nwhere the integers m and n are, respectively, the rank dim H 0 (E) and the degree dim H 2 (E) of\nE defined through the Chern character map. We can therefore denote the state corresponding to E as\n(m, n). The sheaves \u0131\u22c6 OC and \u0131\u22c6 Op can then be identified as the states (1, 0) and (0, 1) respectively. The\ngrade of E is defined by (2.4) as the phase of the central charge (2.7). These states are identified as the\ndyons in the Seiberg-Witten theory, with electric and magnetic charges n and m, respectively.\n\n3 Stable sheaves and dyons\nThe spectrum of dyons in the Seiberg-Witten theory consists in the \u03a0-stable objects of Db(M), obtained\nfrom Db(C) under the pull-back \u0131\u22c6 . Thus, in order to find the dyons we need to analyse \u03a0-stability of the\nsheaves on C and their complexes thereof. The dyons are identified as (m, n)-strings or string junctions\nin the type-IIB theory [14]. As mentioned above, an analysis of \u03a0-stability involves two steps. First, the\nmarginal stability locus is to be obtained. Then stability as one goes off this locus is to be checked.\nThus, in order to study \u03a0-stability of the dyons in the Seiberg-Witten theory we first need to ascertain\nthe marginal stability locus that, in the case at hand, is but a line, which we refer to as the MS-line\nin the sequel. Let us consider the objects in (2.2). Let the central charges of the branes involved be\nZ(A) = mA \u031fD + nA \u031f, Z(B) = mB \u031fD + nB \u031f and Z(C) = mC \u031fD + nC \u031f, respectively, with\nmC = mB \u2212 mA and nC = nB \u2212 nA . Then, the MS-line is given by\n1 = \u03c6(B) \u2212 \u03c6(A)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nmB \u031fD /\u031f + nB\n1\n,\n= \u2212 arg\n\u03c0\nmA \u031fD /\u031f + nA\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhich is satisfied only if \u031fD /\u031f is a real number. Thus, the MS-line is given by\narg(\u031fD /\u031f) = 0.\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe curve in the z-plane is homotopic to a circle (see e.g. [27] and references therein for works related\nto MS-line) separating the strong and weak coupling regions of the Seiberg-Witten theory, indicated by\nS and W, respectively, in Figure 1. The MS-line goes through the points z = \u00b11. The two 7-branes and\nthe D3-brane of the type-IIB probe picture are all transverse to the z-plane. They are thus represented\nby points in this plane. The 7-branes are situated at z = \u00b11, while the D3-brane moves around in the\nplane. In order to test the \u03a0-stability of the different objects of Db(M) off the MS-line, arg(\u031fD /\u031f)\nis defined as a continuous real-valued function of z [19]. Using (2.3), arg(\u031fD /\u031f) is fixed to be \u03c0/2 at\nthe large volume asymptote. It increases through \u03c0 on the MS-line. From the expression of the central\ncharge in terms of the periods, (2.7), then, we can study stability of sheaves on the z-plane. The stable\nobjects reproduce the dyonic spectrum of the Seiberg-Witten theory [16, 24] both in S and W. This is\nestablished by considering four different cases [19].\n\n4\n\n\fz\n\u007f\n\n\u0131\u22c6 Ip\nz=\u22121\n\nm _ QW\n?\n\nS -\n\n\u0011\n\u2022\n\n\u2022\n\n?\n\nOM\nz=1\n\n\u0011\nQ _ m\n\n\u007f\n\nFigure 1: MS-line separating S and W\n\n3.1 Ideal sheaf & Structure sheaf\nThe two type-IIB 7-branes, with charges (1, \u22121) and (1, 0), are represented by points on the z-plane and\nare situated at z = \u00b11 respectively [20]. The dyons that become massless on the MS-line are wont to\nstand on them provided they possess matching charges. Indeed, restricting our discussions to the upper\nhalf plane of Figure 1 let us consider the pull-back to M of the structure sheaf OC and the ideal sheaf\nIp \u223c\n= OC (\u22121), p being the class of a point in C. From the rank and degree of Ip and OC we remark that\nthey are the dyonic states with charges (1, \u22121) and (1, 0), respectively. Their central charges are\nZ(\u0131\u22c6 Ip ) = \u031fD \u2212 \u031f,\n\nZ(OM ) = \u031fD ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nvanishing at z = \u22121 and z = 1 respectively, which can be checked by explicit computation of the periods\nin the lower-half of the z-plane, Im z < 0. In the upper half, on the other hand, the state corresponding\nto OC (1), with central charge\nZ(\u0131\u22c6 OC (1)) = \u031fD + \u031f\n(3.4)\nbecomes massless at z = \u22121. Thus, depending on whether the string approaches z = \u22121 from above or\nbelow the real axis, it is to be interpreted as OC (1) or Ip , respectively. For the former, we shall mark the\nz = \u22121 point with OC (1). Recalling that the magnitude of the central charge gives the mass of the state\ncorresponding to a sheaf, these are the two states that become massless on the MS-line. Moreover, the\ncharges match with the charges of the 7-branes. The sheaves are marked in Figure 1.\nAn (m, n) string corresponding to a dyon may emanate from either of these and end on the D3-brane\nprobe with any permitted charge, situated at an arbitrary point in the z-plane, after performing sufficient\ncharge-conserving gymnastics as we shall discuss in the next section.\n\n3.2 Torsion sheaf\nThe pull-back of the torsion sheaf Op is identified with the W-boson of the Seiberg-Witten theory corresponding to the dyonic state (0, 1). In the type-IIB probe picture the charge matches with that of the\nD3-brane probe. Its central charge is\nZ(\u0131\u22c6 Op ) = \u031f.\n(3.5)\nIt is \u03a0-stable in the weak coupling region W but in the strong coupling region S it decays into components according the the triangle\nIp\n\n/ Op\n\n/ OC\n\n/ Ip [1] .\n\n(3.6)\n\nThus, a string emanating from the D3-brane in W may bifurcate on the MS-line into Ip and OC , which\nthen end on the two 7-branes as discussed above in \u00a7\u00a73.1. as indicated in Figure 2. This provides our\nfirst example of a three-string junction [14].\n5\n\n\fm _ Q ?\n\u007f\n\n\u0011\n??\n\u007f\u2022\n\u007f\u007f OM\n- ???\n\u007f\n\u007f \u0011\n? ??? \u007f\u007f\u007f \u007f\nQ ??_\"\u007f\u007f\u007fm\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\nz\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\"\"\n\n\u0131\u22c6 Ip \u001f\n\u2022?\n\n\u2022\n\n\u0131\u22c6 Op\n\nFigure 2: The W-boson\n\n3.3 Invertible sheaves on C\nThe invertible sheaves on C, namely OC (n), n > 0, correspond to the dyonic states (1, n) in the SeibergWitten theory. The central charge of this dyon is\n\u0001\nZ \u0131\u22c6 OC (n) = \u031fD + n\u031f.\n\n(3.7)\n\nThese sheaves are stable in the region W, while decay in the region S into components if n > 1 [19].\nThus these states can be interpreted as string junctions similar to the W-boson discussed above, but with\nmore than one string in some of the prongs in general. However, depending on the position of the D3brane in the z-plane an (1, n) dyon can also be interpreted, using a different projective resolution, as\na string spiraling the MS-line in the weak coupling region W before ending on one of the 7-branes at\nz = \u00b11. We shall come back to these states in more detail in \u00a74.\n\n3.4 Higher rank sheaves\nA sheaf E(m, n) with rank m and degree n, with m > 1 on\nSuch states decay on the MS-line according to\n\nP1 splits as E(m, n) = OC (n) \u2295 O\u2295m\u22121\n.\nC\n\nE(m, n) \u2212\u2192 OC (1) + (n \u2212 1)Op + (m \u2212 1)OC\n\u2212\u2192 OC (1) + (n \u2212 1)OC (1) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)OC + (m \u2212 1)OC\n\n(3.8)\n\n\u2212\u2192 nOC (1) + (m \u2212 n)OC ,\nwhere we used the notation nE = E\u2295n for a sheaf E. The decay process can be deduced as follows.\n\u2295(n\u22121)\nOn the MS-line OC (n) decays to OC (1) and Op\n[19], since OC (n) with n > 1 are not stable in S.\nHence the first line in (3.8). But nor is Op stable in S. It decays into OC (1) and OC . Combining this\nwith the earlier decay process we deduce the decay (3.8). Both the products in the last step are stable in\nS. These states are thus represented as junctions with more than one strings connecting the vertex to the\nz = \u00b11 points as in Figure 3. To summarise, the stable sheaves in the weak coupling region W are Op\ncorresponding to the W-boson with dyon charge (0, 1) and the invertible sheaves OC (n) with dyon charge\n(1, n) for n \u2265 0. In the strong coupling region S, however, the stable sheaves are the structure sheaf OC\n\n6\n\n\f\u2022\u001c\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\n\nz\n\n\u001c\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\n\n\u001c \u0131\u22c6 E(m, n)\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\u001c\n\u001c\nm \u007f\u007f_\u001c???Q ?\n\u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f ???\n\u007f\u007fn m\u2212n??? \u0011\n??\n\u0131\u22c6 OC (1) \u001f \u007f\u007f\u007f\n\u2022\u007f\n\u2022\nO\n\u0011 M\n?\nQ _ m \u007f\n\nFigure 3: Higher rank sheaves as junctions\n\nwith dyon charge (1, 0) and the invertible sheaf OC (1) with dyon charge (1, 1). This corresponds to the\nspectra of the Seiberg-Witten theory in these two regions [16, 19, 24].\nLet us close this section with a short note on the large volume monodromy transformation of the\nsheaves. The large volume monodromy transformation of an object corresponds to tensoring the object in\nDb(C) with OC (1), which can be looked upon as a Fourier-Mukai transform [25]. Since coordinate of the\nSeiberg-Witten moduli space z is related to the type IIA moduli space through the relation x1 = z12 [19],\na rotation around z = 0 in the z-plane would correspond to tensoring by OC (\u22122) in the K\u00e4hler moduli\nspace of M.\n\n4 Complexes, spirals and junctions\nWe already encountered an example of a three-pronged junction in \u00a7\u00a73.2, where the dyon corresponding\nto the sheaf \u0131\u22c6 Op was looked upon as a string junction bifurcating into two prongs on the MS-line. In\nthis section we concern ourselves with the interpretation of the invertible sheaves as spiral strings and\njunctions. In many of the instances discussed in this section some of the prongs of a junction will have\nmore than one strings in it, as encountered in \u00a7\u00a73.4. Since we study the possible decays of an invertible\nsheaf OC (n), and its interpretation as junctions or spiral strings, we consider projective resolutions of it,\nwhich may replace the sheaf in the derived category. One such resolution which we shall use repeatedly\nis provided by the short exact sequence\n0\n\n/ (n \u2212 k \u2212 1)O(k)\n\n/ (n \u2212 k)O(k + 1)\n\n/ O(n)\n\n/0,\n\n(4.1)\n\nfor n > k + 1, n and k being integers. In the above equation as well as in the rest of this section\nall sheaves are on C with their pull-backs assumed to furnish the branes on the Calabi-Yau manifold M.\nHence we drop the subscript and \u0131\u22c6 as well. Let us present a few examples first, which we shall generalise\nthen.\n\n7\n\n\f4.1 Examples\nExample 1 First, let us consider the invertible sheaf O(2) of degree 2. Putting k = 0 and n = 2 in (4.1)\nwe get\n/ O(2)\n/0.\n/O\n/ 2O(1)\n(4.2)\n0\nIn order to study the stability of O(2) against decaying into the components we compute the difference\nof their grades,\n\u0001\n1\n(4.3)\n\u03c6 2O(1) \u2212 \u03c6(O) \u2212 1 = \u22121 \u2212 arg (1 + \u031f/\u031fD ) .\n\u03c0\nAs we cross the MS-line the difference increases through zero. That is, O(2) decays into O and two\ncopies of O(1) on the MS-line (We are not explicitly differentiating between brane and antibrane as\nthat is obvious from the grading). The above sequence is represented as a junction with three prongs.\nHowever, now there are two strings that can end on the 7-brane at z = \u22121 corresponding to the two\ncopies of O(1) in (4.2) so that the corresponding prong has two strings as shown in Figure 4(a).\n\n\u2022\u001c\n\nz\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\u001c\n\n\u001c\u001c\n\n\u2022\u001c\n\n\u22c6\n\u001c\u001c \u0131 OC (2)\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\n\nz\n\n\u001c\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\n\n\u001c \u0131\u22c6 OC (n)\n\n\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\u001c\n\u001c\nm \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f_?\u001c ??Q ?\n\u007f\n\u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f ???\n\u007f\n?? \u0011 \u007f\u007f\u007f\n??\n\u0131\u22c6 OC (1) \u007f\u001f \u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\u007f\n?\n\u2022\n\u2022\u007f\nO\n\u0011 M\n?\nQ _ m \u007f\n\n\u001c\u001c\n\u001c\u001c\u001c\nm \u007f\u007f_\u001c???Q\n\u007f \u007f\u007f\u007f ??? ?\n? \u0011 \u007f\u007fn\nn\u22121 ???\n\u0131\u22c6 OC (1) \u001f \u007f\u007f\u007f\n?\n\u2022\n\u2022\u007f\nO\n\u0011 M\n?\nQ _ m \u007f\n\n(a) O(2) as a junction\n\n(b) O(n) as a junction\n\nFigure 4: Junctions\n\nExample 2 Let us now consider the degree three invertible sheaf O(3). Putting k = 0 and n = 3 in (4.1)\nwe derive\n/ 2O\n/ 3O(1)\n/ O(3)\n/0.\n(4.4)\n0\nOn the MS-line O(3) decays into the components, three copies of O(3) and two copies of O, governed\nagain by (4.3). Thus this corresponds again to a three-pronged junction. Three strings join the junction\nto the z = \u22121 point on the MS-line and two join the vertex to z = 1, as in Figure 4(b) for n = 3.\nThis case presents another possibility, however. Putting n = 3 and k = 1 in (4.1) we get another\nprojective resolution of O(3) given by the short exact sequence\n0\n\n/ O(1)\n\n/ 2O(2)\n\n/ O(3)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.5)\n\nNow, in the derived category, an object may be replaced by its projective resolution, without altering its\ncohomology. Furthermore, the sheaf O(3) is \u03a0-stable with respect to decaying into the other two sheaves\n8\n\n\f/ O(1)\n/ 2O(2) for the\nappearing in the resolution (4.5). Hence, we can trade the resolution 0\ndyon O(3). The string emanating from the D3-brane at an arbitrary z, corresponding to O(3) ends as\nO(1) on the 7-brane at z = \u22121. It goes around the MS-line once before doing so, thereby reducing its\ncharge by undergoing a large volume monodromy transformation, corresponding to being tensored by\nO(\u22122), from (1, 3) of O(3) to (1, 1) of O(1). Hence, this corresponds to a spiral, as shown in Figure 5(a).\nLet us point out that the sheaves in the resolution are stable only in the weak coupling region W. Hence\nthe spiral never crosses the MS-line.\n\nExample 3 We consider the sheaf O(4) with degree four next. It appears in the short exact sequence\n/ 3O\n\n0\n\n/ 4O(1)\n\n/0,\n\n/ O(4)\n\n(4.6)\n\nobtained from (4.1) by putting n = 4 and k = 0. It decays into the components on the MS-line, governed\nonce again by (4.3). As before, then, this corresponds to a junction as in Figure 4(b) with four strings\nconnecting the vertex to the 7-brane at z = \u22121 and three connecting it to the 7-brane at z = 1.\nIn order to see the spiral string corresponding to this dyon we consider another projective resolution\nof O(4). Putting n = 4 and k = n \u2212 2 in (4.1) we obtain the short exact sequence\n/ O(2)\n\n0\n\n/ 2O(3)\n\n/ O(4)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.7)\n\nThis, as it is can not be interpreted as a spiral, nor as a junction, since O(2) is not stable inside the MSline. The resolution corresponding to a spiral must end on the left with either O or O(1), in order to be\npermitted to end on either 7-brane. In order to construct such a resolution we splice the sequence (4.7)\nwith (4.2) to form the Yoneda composite\n0\n\n/O\n\n/ 2O(1)\n\n/ 2O(3)\n\n/ O(4)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe sheaves participating in this exact sequence are stable in W. Hence, as before, we can trade in the\n/ 2O(1)\n/O\n/ 2O(3) for the dyon O(4) in Db(C). Thus the string\nprojective resolution 0\ncorresponding to the dyon O(4) emanating from the D3-brane in W ends on the 7-brane at z = 1 as\nO. The string spirals the MS-line twice in W and never going beyond this region, thus reducing charges\nthrough large volume monodromy from (1, 4) to (1, 0), before ending on O [15], as in Figure 5(b).\nExample 4 Let us now consider the degree five sheaf O(5) as our final example before we generalise\nthese considerations. Putting n = 5 and k = 0 in (4.1) we derive the short exact sequence\n0\n\n/ 4O\n\n/ 5O(1)\n\n/ O(5)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.9)\n\nThe dyon O(5) decays, one more time, to the components on the MS-line governed by (4.3) and hence\ninterpreted, as before, as a three-pronged junction as in Figure 4(b) with n = 5 with five strings between\nthe vertex and the 7-brane at z = \u22121 and four between the vertex and the 7-brane at z = 1.\nThe spiral string, once again, is obtained by considering a different projective resolution of O(5) in\nterms of sheaves stable in W. Putting n = 5 and k = n \u2212 2 = 3 in (4.1) we obtain\n0\n\n/ O(3)\n\n/ 2O(4)\n\n9\n\n/ O(5)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.10)\n\n\fSince the sheaves O(4) and O(3) are not stable in the strong coupling region, this sequence can not be\ninterpreted as a junction. We need to find resolutions ending with either O or O(1) in order to obtain a\nspiral string. Splicing the short exact sequence (4.10) with (4.5) we derive the exact sequence\n/ O(1)\n\n0\n\n/ 2O(2)\n\n/ 2O(4)\n\n/ O(5)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.11)\n\nThe sheaves in this exact sequence are stable in W and hence O(5) is replaced with its resolution in\nDb(C). This time, however, the string ends as O(1) on the 7-brane at z = \u22121, as in the case of O(3). The\nright amount of reduction of charges by large volume monodromy requires, then, that the string spirals\naround the MS-line four times before ending on the 7-brane.\n\n4.2 General formulas & transitions\nThese considerations exemplify a general situation to which we now turn. The strategy is exactly the\nsame as we have discussed in the context of the above examples. Namely, to obtain a three-pronged\njunction we need a short exact sequence which provides a resolution of a degree n invertible sheaf O(n) in\nterms of the sheaves O and O(1). Then, a spiral string is obtained as another resolution ending on the left\nwith either O or O(1), with a sequence of sheaves in-between, all of which are stable in the weak coupling\nregion W. The number of windings of the spiral around the MS-line is obtained by requiring charge\nconservation and remarking that the degree of a sheaf reduces by 2 under the large volume monodromy\ntransformation. Finally, we study the transitions between the two types of resolutions.\n\u2022\n\nz\n\n\u2022\n\n\u0131\u22c6 O(n)\n\nz\n\nm _ Q?\n\u22c6\n\u001f\u2022\u0011\u0131 OC (1) \u2022\nOM \u0011\n?\nQ _ m\u007f\n\n\u0131\u22c6 O(n)\n\nm _ Q?\n\u22c6\n\u001f\u2022\u0011\u0131 OC (1) \u2022\nOM \u0011\n?\nQ _ m\u007f\n\n\u007f\n\n\u007f\n\n(a) n odd: spiral string ending on\nOC (1)\n\n(b) n even: spiral string ending on\n\nOM\n\nFigure 5: Spiral strings ending on different branes\nIn generalising the examples along the lines described above let us first note the projective resolution\nof an invertible sheaf O(n) of degree n given by the short exact sequence\n0\n\n/ (n \u2212 1)O\n\n/ nO(1)\n\n/ O(n)\n\n/0,\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich is obtained by putting k = 0 in (4.1). The sheaf O(n) breaks into the components on the MS-line,\nthe decay being governed by (4.3). Hence, this is interpreted as a junction as in Figure 4(b) with n strings\nconnecting the z = \u22121 point and n \u2212 1 strings connecting the z = 1 point to the vertex of the junction.\n\n10\n\n\fThe resolutions corresponding to the spiral strings are obtained by forming Yoneda composites of\ncomplexes iteratively, as in the examples above.

In order to obtain the projective resolutions suitable for\nour purpose we proceed iteratively, by finding a resolution of the leftmost sheaf in the above sequence\n(4.13), namely, O(n \u2212 2) by replacing n by n \u2212 2 in (4.1) and putting k = (n \u2212 2) \u2212 2. This yields\n0\n\n/ O(n \u2212 4)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 3)\n\n/ O(n \u2212 2)\n\n/0.\n\n(4.14)\n\nIf n \u2265 4, then this sequence again fails to correspond to a junction. We splice it with the sequence (4.13),\nderiving another projective resolution of O(n) as\n0\n\n/ O(n \u2212 4)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 3)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 1)\n\n/ O(n)\n\n(4.15)\n\n/ 0.\n\nContinuing this and splicing the resulting resolutions to form Yoneda composites iteratively until we\nhave a resolution ending of the left with either a single O or O(1), we arrive at a projective resolution of\nO(n) as\n0\n\n/O\n\n/ ***\n\n/ 2O(1)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 3)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 1)\n\n/ O(n)\n\n/0\n\n(4.16)\n\nif n is an even integer, and\n0\n\n/ O(1)\n\n/ ***\n\n/ 2O(2)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 3)\n\n/ 2O(n \u2212 1)\n\n/ O(n)\n\n/0\n\n(4.17)\n\nif n is odd. Since all the sheaves participating in the resolution of O(n) are stable W, we can trade in the\nprojective resolution for O(n) in Db(C). As in the examples above, the corresponding spiral string ends\nat z = 1 as O if n is even and at z = \u22121 as O(1) if n is odd. Since the large volume monodromy acts on\na sheaf by tensoring with O(\u22122), the string spirals around n/2 times if n is even and (n \u2212 1)/2 times if\nn is odd, before ending up on the MS-line, in keeping with earlier findings [15].\nLet us now discuss the transitions between the spiral strings and the junctions. So far we discussed\nthe interpretation of the same dyon state (1, n) with n > 1 as either a three-pronged junction or a spiral\nstring ending at z = \u00b11. But at a certain point of the moduli space we expect a unique description of the\ndyons [26]. This means, in the moduli space the dyon is described by the junction in a certain region and\nby a spiral string in some other. On the boundary of these two regions there must be transitions between\nthem [15].\nNow, the replacement of an object C in Db(M) by its projective resolution, as given by (2.2) while\nalways possible mathematically, is but physically meaningful when the charges of the branes are properly\naligned to preserve some SUSY [18], as is encoded in the condition for \u03a0-stability (2.5). This requires\nthe grades of B and C of (2.2) to be equal. Hence, in order to determine which of the resolutions is to\nbe chosen to replace O(n), among the two possibilities discussed above, we need to compare the grades\nof the objects in the resolutions. The appropriate resolution at a certain point in the z-plane is chosen\ndepending on which of the resolutions satisfy (2.5). In order to see this explicitly, let us first rewrite the\nsequences (4.16) and (4.17) as\n0\n\n/O\n\n/B\n\n11\n\n/ O(n)\n\n/ 0,\n\n(4.18)\n\n\fand\n0\n\n/ O(1)\n\n/B\n\n/ O(n)\n\n/ 0,\n\n(4.19)\n\nrespectively by denoting the intermediate complex by B. These correspond to the spirals as discussed\nbefore. For all of these resolutions the grade of the complex B is\n\u03c6(B) = \u22121,\n\n(4.20)\n\ncalculated from its Chern character ch(B) = (0, n), n > 1, using the large volume expression (2.3). This\nis to be contrasted with the situation with the short exact sequence (4.12). The middle term is nO(1),\nwith grade\n\u0001\n\u03c6 nO(1) = \u22123/2\n(4.21)\n\nto the leading order in W. Now, the replacement of the sheaf O(n) in the derived category Db(C) by\na projective resolution as in (2.2) with C = O(n) is physically proper if its grade equals that of B,\nas given by (2.5). For the spirals (4.18) and (4.19), \u03c6(B) = \u22121, while for the three-pronged junction\n(4.12) we have \u03c6(B) = \u22123/2. Thus, depending on whether the grade of O(n) is \u22123/2 or \u22121, the\nresolution appropriate for it to be replaced with is (4.12) or either of (4.16) or (4.17), if n is even or\nodd, respectively. This change of grade occurs as the dyon (1, n) crosses the line arg(z) = \u03c0/2 in\nthe moduli space. Hence, as the dyon crosses this line, a spiral string corresponding to O(n), given by\neither of (4.16) and (4.17) makes transition into the junction given by (4.12), which agrees with earlier\nresults [15]. These cases exhaust the possibilities that come from (4.1). Other values of k do not lead to\nqualitatively new resolution.\n\n5 Conclusion\nTo conclude, in this article we have considered the dyons in the Seiberg-Witten theory from the point of\nview of B-branes wrapping holomorphic cycles in a Calabi-Yau manifold M in the geometrical engineering limit. Such B-branes correspond to the derived category of coherent sheaves on M. In the geometric\nengineering limit this category is assumed to be generated by the coherent sheaves on the projective line,\nP1, the sole compact survivor of the limit [19]. The \u03a0-stable sheaves in this derived category reproduce\nthe dyons in the Seiberg-Witten theory [19]. The notion of the derived category stems from the need\nto identify an object of an abelian category with its resolutions. By introducing a grade in the derived\ncategory, the criterion of \u03a0-stability provides a physical meaning to such replacements. The replacement\nis physically meaningful provided the grades of the objects participating in the resolution obey certain\nconditions (2.5). A dyon of the Seiberg-Witten theory decays on a certain marginal stability locus, the\nMS-line, according to this condition. The stable dyons on the two sides of the line are different. An estimation of the stable dyons on the two sides involve distinguished triangles in the triangulated category\nunderlying Db(P1 ), which, in turn, correspond to short exact sequences in the abelian category. These\ntriangles are interpreted as three-pronged junctions, involving prongs corresponding to strings on both\nsides of the MS-line resting on the stable dyons on the line itself. In general the prongs of a junction\nare found to have more than one strings in it, consistent with earlier findings [14]. Considering certain\nother projective resolutions of the invertible sheaves on P1 , involving sheaves which are stable on only\none side of the MS-line, the weak coupling region of the Seiberg-Witten theory, we show that such resolutions do not correspond to pronged junctions, as they are not allowed to penetrate the strong-coupling\n12\n\n\fregion beyond the MS-line. These resolutions, obtained by forming Yoneda composites of short exact\nsequences of sheaves on P1 iteratively, are interpreted as strings spiraling the MS-line in the weak coupling region, ending finally on 7-branes situated on the MS-line at z = \u00b11. Using the condition (2.5) we\nthen compare the grades of the two resolutions and find that they may replace a dyon corresponding to\nan invertible sheaf OP1 (n), with n > 1 in but different regions of the moduli space spanned by z. As the\ndyon crosses the line arg(z) = \u03c0/2 in the z-plane, a three-pronged junction takes over a spiral string or\nvice versa, thus corroborating earlier results [15].\nThese considerations, apart from reproducing the junctions and spirals of the Seiberg-Witten theory\nand their transitions, clearly brings out the role of the grade of \u03a0-stability in deciding the replacement for\nan object in the derived category in a physically meaningful manner. It will be interesting to see if similar\nconsiderations predict such transitions in more complicated situations, for example, for string junctions\ncorresponding to Seiberg-Witten theories arising from D-branes on del Pezzo surfaces. Investigation\nalong this line is currently underway.\n\nAcknowledgment\nSM and KR would like to thank Ansar Fayyazuddin and Alok Kumar for useful discourses at different\nstages of this work.
