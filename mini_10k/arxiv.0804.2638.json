In particular through the existence\nof Feshbach resonance these systems provide a physical\nrealization of the BEC-BCS crossover, and around the\nresonance very simple examples of strongly interacting\nfermionic systems, of high interest for example in condensed matter physics. More recently much efforts have\nfocused on systems where there is a possibly strong imbalance between the two fermionic populations present\nin these gases [1, 2], corresponding for example to the\ntwo lowest energy hyperfine states of 6 Li or 40 K.\nA very interesting limiting case of such imbalanced\nmixture is the case of a single fermion (say \u2193-spin) with\nmass m\u2193 in the presence of a Fermi sea of another, say\n\u2191, fermion species with mass m\u2191 . This kind of mixture\nhas anyway to be considered in the analysis [3, 4] of experiments on trapped gases. Of major importance for\nthe analysis of the phase diagram [3, 4, 5] are the binding energy Eb and the effective mass m\u2217 of the \u2193-atom.\nAt unitarity recent fixed-node Monte Carlo (MC) calculations [5] give (5/3)Eb /EF = 0.99(1) where EF is\nthe Fermi energy of the \u2191 atoms. On the other hand\na simple T -matrix analytical calculation, which happens\nto coincide with a variational calculation [4, 6], gives\nEb = 0.6066EF which is remarkably close to the MC result. This closeness has been confirmed very recently by\ndiagrammatic MC calculations, leading to Eb = 0.618EF\n[7] or Eb = 0.615EF [8], depending on the specific detailed handling. The very close proximity of the analytical and the MC results, considered to be quite near\nthe exact result, is a major puzzle. Indeed at unitarity\nthe system is strongly interacting, whereas the analytical\ntreatment considers only single particle-hole excitations\n(of the non-interacting Hamiltonian Hc ). This description is only appropriate for a weakly interacting system\nand should fail to a large extent at unitarity.\nIn this paper we solve this puzzle and at the same time\nprovide an essentially exact solution to the problem. This\n\nis done by considering states with any number of particlehole excitations. While the ground state of the interacting Hamiltonian H has important weights coming from\nmany particle-hole excitations, we show that with respect\nto the calculation of the energy of the \u2193-atom these states\ngive contributions which decrease extremely rapidly with\nthe number of particle-hole excitations. This is basically\ndue to destructive interferences between contributions of\nthese many particle-hole excitations states when two particles (or holes) are exchanged. The efficiency of these\ninterferences is directly linked to the key ingredient of\nour solution, namely the fact that an expansion in powers of the holes wavevectors qi turns out, quite surprisingly and unexpectedly, to be an excellent approximation\nscheme. To lowest order in this approximation, i.e. when\nthe dependence on the qi 's is neglected, the interference\nis perfect and there is a complete decoupling between\nthe states with different number of particle-hole excitations. In particular this justifies the consideration of single particle-hole excitations and explains why the above\nanalytical result is so good. Improving the approximation by taking more properly into account the qi dependence provides a small coupling between the states with\none and two particle-hole excitations, providing a small\ncorrection to the preceding result. In turn an even better handling of this dependence gives a coupling between\nstates with two and three particle-hole excitations, giving\na small change to the preceding small correction, and so\non. In this way we obtain a series of results with strongly\nincreasing accuracy, converging extremely rapidly to the\nexact result [9].\nSince the theoretical solution of this problem has\nreached a high and secure level of agreement, which is\nquite unfrequent in many-body problems including the\ncase of cold fermionic gases, it provides a useful and\nconvenient benchmark for experiments. Fortunately the\nagreement with experiments seems reasonably good [10].\nMoreover our solution is of high general interest since\nexact solutions of many-body problems are quite unfrequent, mainly for three dimensional cases. Our finding\n\n\f2\nthat a hole-wavevector expansion works so well is also\nquite interesting, and it would be worthwhile to apply it\nto more complex many-body problems. Another useful\nconclusion regarding self-consistent treatments can also\nbe taken out of our solution. An attractive and standard\nway to try to improve on a simple T -matrix approximation, such as the one used in [6], is to use full propagators rather than bare ones in the T -matrix. The practical\nhandling is much more complicated, but this seems much\nmore satisfactory since this amounts to include an infinite set of higher order diagrams. This has been done\nfor example recently in the BEC-BCS crossover for equal\nspin populations [11]. We have made the corresponding\nself-consistent treatment for the T -matrix approximation\nof Ref.[6]. The result at unitarity is Eb = 0.68 EF , much\nworst than the non self-consistent one. Our solution allows to understand this failure. Indeed the exact solution displays almost complete cancellations between diagrams, whereas the self-consistent treatment destroys\nthis delicate balance since it retains only some diagrams\nat a given order. Hence self-consistency does not systematically lead to an improvement.\nHere we concentrate on the unitarity case. Indeed in\nthe weak limit a \u2192 0\u2212 , an expansion in powers of a\nshould be valid and the lowest order correction should\ngive already quite good results. On the other side of\nunitarity, one can easily see from the details given below that our approximation should improve for increasing 1/a > 0. Hence unitarity is a kind of worst case\nfor our approach. Since it attracts in addition most of\nthe interest in the strong coupling regime of large a, this\njustifies that we restrict our discussion to this case. Generalization away from unitarity is quite obvious.\nBefore presenting our solution, we display very explicitely the efficiency of the qi expansion on the simplest case of the lowest order solution [6]. At unitarity,\nfor equal masses m\u2191 = m\u2193 = m, the binding energy\nEb = \u2212E = |E| is given by:\n#\u22121\n\"\nX 1\nX Xm\n(1)\n\u2212\n|E| =\n(1)\nk2\nE\nq<kF\n\nk>kF\n\nk\n\nkq\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ekq = |E| + \u01ebk\u2212q + \u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebq with \u01ebk = k2 /2m.\n(1)\n\nSetting q = 0 in Ekq leads to the equation 2/3\u03c1 =\np\np\n1 + \u03c1/2 arctan \u03c1/2 for \u03c1 = |E|/EF . The solution\n\u03c1 = 0.5347 is not so far from the actual result, which\nis already pretty satisfactory for such a crude approximation. However we may quite improve on it by treating q to lowest significant order instead of neglecting\nit completely. This means we take for the k angu\u22121\n\u22121\nlar average h[|E| +\u01ebk\u2212q + \u01ebk \u2212\u01ebq] ik \u2243 [2\u01ebk + |E|] +\n\u22123\nq 2 k 2 /(3m2 ) [2\u01ebk + |E|] . This gives at unitarity \u03c1 =\n0.5985, which is remarkable compared to the exact [6] solution \u03c1 = 0.6066 of Eq.(1) and the MC result (5/3)\u03c1 =\n0.99(1) [5]. If we do not restrict ourselves to unitarity\n\nand let the scattering length vary, the corresponding solution for \u03c1 turns out to be essentially undistinguishable\non a graph from the exact numerical solution [6]. Although the situation is somewhat less favourable for unequal masses, this shows very simply and explicitely the\nvalidity and efficiency of this qi expansion approach. We\napply it now to the full many-body problem.\nThe Hamiltonian of our problem is:\nH = Hc + V\nX\nX\nHc =\nE(P)b\u2020P bP +\n\u01ebk c\u2020k ck\nP\n\nV = g\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nk\n\nX\n\n\u03b4kk\u2032 PP\u2032 c\u2020k ck\u2032 b\u2020P bP\u2032\n\n(4)\n\nkk\u2032 PP\u2032\n\nwhere \u01ebk = k2 /2m\u2191 , E(P) = P2 /2m\u2193 , and ck and\nc\u2020k are annihilation and creation operators for \u2191-spin\natoms while bP and b\u2020P are for the \u2193-spin atom. In\nthe potential energy term V , the short-ranged interaction potential provides an upper cut-off kc , which we\nwill as usual let go to infinity while the coupling constant g goes to zero, keeping the scattering\nlength finite\nPkc\n2mr /k 2 , where\nin the relation mr /(2\u03c0a) = g \u22121 +\nmr = m\u2191 m\u2193 /(m\u2191 + m\u2193 ) is the reduced mass. Momentum conservation in the scattering is insured by the Kronecker symbol \u03b4kk\u2032 PP\u2032 . Physically this potential energy\nterm creates (or annihilates) a single particle-hole pair\nfrom the Fermi sea, or merely scatters particles or holes,\nthe momentum transfer being taken by the \u2193-spin atom.\nHence we are looking for the ground state as a general\nsuperposition of states with any number of particle-hole\npairs:\nX\n|\u03c8i = \u03b10 |0i +\n\u03b1kq c\u2020k cq |0i + * * *\n(5)\nkq\n\n+\n\n1\n(n!)2\n\nX\n\n{ki }{qj }\n\n\u03b1ki qj\n\nn\nY\n\ni=1\n\nc\u2020ki\n\nn\nY\n\ncqj |0i + * * *\n\nj=1\n\nQ\nwhere |0i = k<kF c\u2020k |vaci is the Fermi sea of \u2191-spins.\nFor simplicity, in all the terms, we have not written explicitely the creation operator b\u2020P of the \u2193-spin since its\nmomentum P is just obtained to insure that the total momentum of the particles in any term is zero. We assume\nalso implicitely ki > kF and qj < kF . The coefficients\n\u03b1ki qj (which is a shorthand for \u03b1{ki }{qj } ) are naturally\nantisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any their\narguments ki or qj .\nWriting H|\u03c8i = E|\u03c8i (where we take as zero for the\nenergy E the energy of the whole Fermi sea, and omit the\naverage potential energy which disappears for g \u2192 0) and\nidentifying the coefficients of specific particle-hole states\nin both terms, we find for the equations corresponding\nto the full Fermi sea and the Fermi sea with a single\nparticle-hole pair:\nX\n\u2212 g \u22121 |E|\u03b10 =\n\u03b1kq\n(6)\nkq\n\n\f3\n(1)\n\n\u2212 g \u22121 Ekq \u03b1kq = \u03b10 +\n\nX\n\n\u03b1Kq \u2212\n\nK\n\nX\nQ\n\n\u03b1kQ \u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03b1kKqQ (7)\n\nKQ\n\nP\n(n)\nwhere we have introduced Eki qj = |E| + E( ni ki \u2212\nPn\nPn\nPn\nj \u01ebqj . In the second equation the\ni \u01ebki \u2212\nj qj ) +\nfirst term comes from the creation of a particle-hole pair\nin the Fermi sea, the second from the diffusion of the\nparticle, the third from the diffusion of the hole and the\nlast one from the annihilation of a particle-hole pair. In\nthe last term, from two particle-hole pair states, there\nare four combinations for annihilation of a particle-hole\npair (this would be n2 in the general case). The next\nequation from two particle-hole pairs states is:\n(2)\n\n\u2212 g \u22121 Ekk\u2032 qq\u2032 \u03b1kk\u2032 qq\u2032 = \u2212\u03b1kq \u2212 \u03b1k\u2032 q\u2032 + \u03b1kq\u2032 + \u03b1k\u2032 q\n+\n\nX\n\n\u03b1Kk\u2032 qq\u2032 +\n\nK\n\n+\n\nX\n\nX\nK\n\n\u03b1Kkk\u2032 Qqq\u2032\n\nX\nX\n\u03b1kKqq\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1kk\u2032 Qq\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1kk\u2032 qQ\nQ\n\nQ\n\n(8)\n\nKQ\n\nwith physical origins for the various terms analogous to\nthe preceding ones. One could write formally the generalization for any order, but we will not do it since this\nwill not be necessary.\nIn Eq.(7) the second term turns out to give a divergent contribution when kc \u2192 \u221e and the limit is finite\nonly after multiplication by g. By comparison the third\nterm, where the summation is on the Fermi sea, displays\nno divergence and gives a zero contribution after multiplication by g. Hence we omit it from now on. Similarly\nin Eq.(8) we can omit the two analogous sums over Q.\nWe see that, to solve our problem,\nthe only thing\nP\nwe need to know from Eq.(8) is KQ \u03b1kKqQ , which is\nthe only quantity entering Eq.(7) from the subspace of\ntwo particle-hole pairs added to the Fermi sea. Now, if\nwe neglect the wavevectors q and q\u2032 in E (2) and take\n(2)\n(2)\nEkk\u2032 qq\u2032 \u2243 Ekk\u2032 00 , we can sum Eq.(8) over q\u2032 . Because\nof the antisymmetry of \u03b1Kkk\u2032 Qqq\u2032 in the exchange of Q\nand q\u2032 , the last term drops out. Hence, through this\nsummation, Eq.(8) provides\nus with an integral equaP\ntion for the function KQ \u03b1kKqQ . We see that our approximation makes the subspaces with higher number of\nparticle-hole pairs irrelevant for our problem, and we are\ncompletely decoupled from these higher subspaces. We\nhave obtained, together with Eq.(6)\nP and Eq.(7) a closed\nset of equations for \u03b10 , \u03b1kq and KQ \u03b1kKqQ , which can\nclearly be solved exactly by numerical means to provide\nthe energy |E|. The precise justification for our approximation is that k, k \u2032 > kF and q, q \u2032 < kF make indeed in\n(2)\nEkk\u2032 qq\u2032 the k and k \u2032 terms dominant and q and q \u2032 ones\nnegligible in a large part of the variables space. Naturally this is an approximation, the interference is not exact but not so far from it. Hence the contribution from\n\nthree particle-hole pairs states is not zero, but it is quite\nsmall which is the essential point.\nThe same argument applied at the level of Eq.(7) allows now to understand the success of the lowest or(1)\nder approach. If we make the approximation Ekq \u2243\n|E| + E(k) + \u01ebk and sum Eq.(7) over q, we see that the\nlast term is disappearing, due to the antisymmetry of\n\u03b1kKqQ with respect to the exchange of q and Q, which\nleaves\nus with a decoupled set of equations for \u03b10 and\nP\n\u03b1\n, leading to the good approximation discussed\nkq\nkq\nat the beginning. Conversely we may decide to make\n(n)\n(n)\nthe approximation Eki qj \u2243 Eki at some higher order n.\nThis provides by the same procedure a decoupling from\nhigher order subspaces resulting in a closed set of n equations to be solved for |E|. Hence our analysis leads us to\na cascade of successive approximations which converges\nvery rapidly in a controlled way to the exact many-body\nsolution, providing at the same time a full understanding of the success of the lowest order approximations and\na practical way to obtain the exact results within the\nprecision we like.\nIn practice the convergence is so fast, as shown by the\nquality of the lowest order results, that we will only need\nfor any practical purpose to implement it to the next\n(i.e. second) order. However, in addition to our main\nscheme of approximations going from one order to the\nnext, we may within a given order introduce an additional graduation of approximations. First we can as de(2)\n(2)\nscribed above make the approximation Ekk\u2032 qq\u2032 \u2243 Ekk\u2032 00\n\u2032\nand sum Eq.(8) over q . However we can easily improve\non this handling in the same spirit as for the lowest order approximation. Indeed the argument is still valid\n(2)\n(2)\nif we make only the approximation Ekk\u2032 qq\u2032 \u2243 Ekk\u2032 q0 ,\nwhich takes better into account the q dependence. Finally since we know that the last term in Eq.(8) brings\nonly a small correction, we may just decide to omit it, but\ntreat the rest of the equation exactly without any approx(2)\nimation on Ekk\u2032 qq\u2032 , which takes even better account of\nthe qi dependence. This handling is at the same level as\ntreating Eq.(1) exactly. In the same way it corresponds\nto a variational calculation since we have restricted the\nHilbert space to contain at most two particle-hole pairs.\nThis is the most precise level of approximation we will\nimplement.\nP\nIntroducing G(k, q, q\u2032 ) = g K \u03b1kKqq\u2032 , dividing\n(2)\nEq.(8) by Ekk\u2032 qq\u2032 , summing over k\u2032 , taking the kc \u2192\n\u221e, g \u2192 0 limit, which makes again some terms vanish,\nwe find the integral equation:\n!#\n\"\nX\n1\n2mr\nmr\n\u2032\n+\n\u2212 \u20322\nG(k, q, q )\n(2)\n2\u03c0a\nk\nEkk\u2032 qq\u2032\nk\u2032\nX G(k\u2032 , q, q\u2032 )\n= \u03b1kq\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1kq +\n(9)\n(2)\nEkk\u2032 qq\u2032\nk\u2032\nThe bracket in the left-hand side can be calculated analytically.

For the effective mass we give\ncoherently the last digits of our results to display clearly the\ntrend, but they should not be taken for granted.\n\nby iteration, the already fast convergence being increased\nby acceleration procedures. The same handling allows to\nsolve the set of Eq.(7,9) with respect to \u03b1kq .\nWe have first checked the convergence of our theoretical scheme in the particular case m\u2193 \u2192 \u221e where the\nbinding energy is known [6] to be exactly \u03c1 = 1/2 at\nunitarity. This is naturally a very convenient case. However one can easily see that the situation, with respect\nto the convergence of the qi expansion, is slightly less favorable than for the equal mass case. This is appearant\nin the first order result [6] \u03c1 = 0.465 which, while being\nfairly good, is not so close to 1/2. A convenient feature\nof this case is that there are no angular integrations to\nperform in solving the various equations. At second order we find 0.481 when we take qq\u2032 = 00. This improves\ninto 0.487 for qq\u2032 = q0. However with no approximation\non E (2) (i.e. the variational result) we find \u03c1 = 0.498,\nwhich shows quite explicitely that essentially, at second\norder, we have already fully converged toward the exact\nresult. The relative sensitivity in this case to the approximations on q may be physically understood as related\nto the lack of quantum smearing from the \u2193-atom since\nit acts as a fixed impurity. Another situation where the\nexact solution is known is the 1D case [6, 14]. Here again\nwe have checked [12] that the second order coincides almost with the exact results, including for the calculation\nof the effective mass [14].\nWe have then proceeded to the same calculations for\nthe equal mass situation (see Fig.1), which is markedly\nbetter in terms of convergence than the infinite mass\ncase. For the qq\u2032 = 00 approximation we find 0.6125,\nthe qq\u2032 = q0 result is 0.6146. Finally the variational\nresult is 0.6156. This displays quite clearly the very fast\nconvergence of the qi expansion. It is very likely that\nthis last result is essentially exact [13] (say, the exact\none is bounded by 0.6158). This is supported by how\nclose our above result for infinite m\u2193 is from the exact\none. More precisely, as seen explicitely from the m\u2193 = \u221e\n\ncase, each order brings a small correction to the preceding one. Since the second order result brings typically a\n10\u22122 correction to the first order one, we expect the third\norder correction to be at most of order 10\u22124 . Naturally\nthe precision of our result is beyond practical use. We\ndisplay it only to support our claim that we have a full\nsolution for our problem.\nFinally we have calculated the effective mass, with the\nsame approach applied to a small nonzero momentum for\nthe whole system. This produces only some minor practical complications. We find m\u2217 /m\u2193 = 1.20. Our above\nprecision on the binding energy gives us typically a \u00b10.02\nuncertainty. In agreement with our above findings, this\nresult is fairly close to the first order value 1.17. We see\nthat there is some significant discrepancies with some MC\nresults [3, 5] as well as conclusions from experiments [10].\nThough they are not major ones, they may be relevant\nfor the detailed understanding of experiments [15].\nWe are grateful to X.
