As hydrogen-ionizing\nphotons from a QSO propagate outwards, they destroy\nneutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium and reduce\nthe number of Lyman-\u03b1 absorption lines in the spectra of\nbackground objects. The change in the Lyman-\u03b1 opacity\nat radius r should therefore provide some indication of the\nQSO's luminosity at the earlier time t \u223c r/c.

The next two\nsections discuss the significance with which the effect can\nbe detected: \u00a7 5 treats the uncertainties from a theoretical\npoint-of-view and concludes that cosmic variance will be\nthe primary problem, while \u00a7 6 discusses the spectroscopic\nexposure times that will be necessary on a 10m telescope\nand argues that neither continuum removal nor interstellar absorption lines will be a major obstacle. The results\nfrom the preceding sections are brought together in one\nplace in \u00a7 7, which presents a sample analysis of a simulated QSO with a known radiative history. Some readers\nmay wish to skip directly to this section. \u00a7 8 discusses the\ntime resolution that can be achieved with this technique.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n8\n\nThe 10 -M\u2299 black holes that lie at the heart of nearby\nbulge galaxies are believed to have accreted much of their\nmass in their youths when they shone briefly and brightly\nas QSOs (e.g., Yu & Tremaine 2002). A great deal could be\nlearned about the physical processes that produce supermassive black holes if we could observe how their brightnesses varied during this time. For example, a black\nhole that radiates at a fraction l \u2261 L/LE of its Eddington luminosity and accretes mass with radiative efficiency\n\u01eb \u2261 L/\u1e40c2 requires tS \u223c MBH /\u1e40BH \u223c 4 \u00d7 107 l(\u01eb/0.1) yrs\nto change its mass significantly. Showing that QSO outbursts have a much shorter duration would confirm the\npopular belief (e.g., Haehnelt & Kauffmann 2000; Cavaliere & Vittorini 2000; Wyithe & Loeb 2002; Di Matteo\net al. 2003) that super-massive black holes build up their\nmasses through numerous accretion episodes. Various theoretical attempts to explain the observed correlation between a black hole's mass and its bulge's velocity dispersion (e.g., Silk & Rees 1998; Adams, Graff, & Richstone\n2001; Burkert & Silk 2001; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Kollmeier\n2004) each postulate different physical mechanisms that\nquench the QSO's luminosity when it reaches a certain\nlevel. To the extent that these mechanisms operate on\ndifferent time scales, measuring the duration of QSO outbursts should help us distinguish between them.\nThe challenge is to figure out from a few short nights or\ndecades of observations how a QSO's brightness changed\nover the preceding few million years. Investigators have\nresorted to a number of indirect schemes. By making assumptions about the link between QSOs and either local\nblack holes or massive potential wells at the redshift of\nobservation, several authors have deduced that individual QSOs are unlikely to have shone for fewer than 1Myr\nor more than 100Myr (e.g., Haehnelt, Natarajan, & Rees\n1998; Richstone et al. 1998; Martini & Weinberg 2001;\nHosokawa 2002). Unfortunately the uncertain underlying\n1\n\n\f2\n\nMeasuring the Radiative Histories of QSOs\n\nMy main conclusions are reviewed and criticized in \u00a7 9.\nI should state at the outset that this is not the only\nmethod for constraining the radiative histories of individual QSOs. Readers may judge for themselves the relative\nmerits of the alternatives that are listed (e.g.) in the excellent review by Martini (2003). Nor is the idea behind\nthe method new. Jakobsen et al. (2003) have used it, for\nexample, to estimate an age of t > 107 yr for the QSO\nQ03022-0023 from the lack of absorption lines in the spectrum of a neighboring QSO. Schirber, Miralda-Escud\u00e9, &\nMcDonald (2004) and Croft (2004) applied a similar analysis to a larger sample of QSO pairs and inferred significantly shorter lifetimes. What is new, as far as I know,\nis the assumption that the background sources will be numerous faint galaxies rather than a single bright QSO. This\ncomplicates the analysis in a number of ways but yields a\nconsiderably more detailed view of the foreground QSO's\nradiative history.\n\nFig. 1.- Schematic view of the underlying concept. QSOs emit\nH-ionizing radiation that will destroy some of the HI in the intergalactic medium out to a maximum radius ctQ , where tQ is the time\nsince the onset of QSO activity. HI in the intergalactic medium produces absorption lines in the spectra of background objects. The\nabsorption is represented by a broken line between the objects and\nthe observer; breaks in the line mark positions with significant HI\nabsorption. By obtaining spectra of numerous galaxies that lie behind a high-redshift QSO, one can (a) map the spatial distribution\nof intergalactic HI around the QSO, (b) use the shape of the region\nwith lowered HI absorption to estimate the rough geometry of the intergalactic volume that has been hit by the QSO's radiation, and (c)\ndeduce the QSO's lifetime and the level of anisotropy in its emission.\n\n2. PRELIMINARIES\n\nThe low observed level of Lyman-\u03b1 absorption from intergalactic gas at z \u223c 3 implies that the gas must be almost completely ionized, with perhaps only one neutral H\natom per million (Gunn & Peterson 1965). As a result\nthe typical hydrogen ionizing photon will travel far before\nit is absorbed, \u223c 50 proper Mpc (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7,\nh = 0.65; Madau, Haardt, & Rees 1999), and one can\nsafely assume that intergalactic gas is optically thin on\nlength scales significantly smaller. Radiation from distant\nsources will permeate this optically thin gas at a roughly\nuniform level Jbg , ionizing residual hydrogen atoms at a\nrate \u0393bg\n\u03b3 nHI where nHI is the neutral hydrogen density\nand\nZ \u221e\n\u0393bg\n\u2261\ndE 4\u03c0Jbg (E)\u03c3i (E)/E\n(1)\n\u03b3\n13.6eV\n\nis an integral over energy of the photon number density\ntimes the hydrogen photoionization cross-section \u03c3i . For\nplausible intensities of the background radiation field, e.g.,\n\nJbg (\u03bd) \u223c 10\u221221.3 (h\u03bd/13.6eV)\u22121.8 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 sterad\u22121 Hz\u22121 ,\n(2)\n\nand for densities near the cosmic mean, photon absorption\nwill be the dominant ionization pathway for hydrogen, and\nthe neutral fraction \u03b7 of intergalactic gas will adjust itself\nuntil the photoionization rate is equal to the recombination\nrate \u03b1HII nHII ne :\n\u03b7\u2261\n\n\u03b1HII ne\nnHI\n\u2243\n.\nnHI + nHII\n\u0393\u03b3\n\n(3)\n\nThe recombination coefficient has a temperature dependence that is well fit by the expression \u03b1HII \u2243 2.11 \u00d7\n10\u221214 T6\u22120.7 (1 + T60.7 )\u22121 cm3 s\u22121 where T6 is the temperature in units of 106 K (Cen 1992).\nNow consider what happens to intergalactic gas when\nit is hit by a blast of ionizing radiation from a nearby\nQSO. The photoionization rate increases by an amount\n\u0393Q\n\u03b3 , given by equation 2 with the QSO's radiation field\nJQ replacing Jbg , and the neutral fraction \u03b7 falls to its\nbg\nQ\nnew equilibrium value \u03b7new = \u03b7old \u0393bg\n\u03b3 /(\u0393\u03b3 + \u0393\u03b3 ) on the\nQ\n4\ntime scale |nHI /\u1e45HI | \u223c 1/\u0393\u03b3 , or \u223c 10 yr if JQ is equal\nto the background intensity Jbg . After the blast subsides,\nrecombination will raise the neutral density back to its\nprevious level on the same time-scale.\nIn contrast to the potentially large swings in the gas's\nneutral fraction, any changes to its temperature should\nbe imperceptibly slight. Although the gas will warm as\nphoto-electrons collide with other particles and distribute\ntheir kinetic energy, the change in its total thermal energy\nwill be negligible: photo-electrons are necessarily as rare\nas neutral atoms (\u223c 1ppm) and their typical kinetic energy\nat ejection\nZ \u221e\n\u22121\n\u01ebHI = (\u0393Q\n)\ndE 4\u03c0JQ (E)\u03c3i (E)(E \u2212 Eth )/E (4)\n\u03b3\nEth\n\n= Eth /(2 + s) \u2243 3.6eV for\n\nJQ (E) \u221d E \u2212s ,\n\ns = 1.8, \u03c3i (E) \u221d E \u22123 , Eth = 13.6eV\nis not very different from the energy per particle in the\n\u223c 20000K undisturbed gas. The gas received its energy of\nabout an eV per particle when it was almost completely\nionized at earlier times, and its temperature will hardly be\naffected by giving a few eV to the particle per million that\nremained neutral.2 This shows that the temperature of the\ngas will not rise appreciably while its ionization balance\nadjusts to the increased ionizing background. Afterwards\nthe gas will be heated by photoionizations at the same\nrate as before-the increase in photoionization rate per\nHI atom will be exactly compensated by a decrease in the\ndensity of HI atoms-and so the equilibrium temperature\nwill be the same in parts of the IGM that are and are not\nilluminated by the QSO's radiation.\n2 I am neglecting the possibility that the gas around the QSO\nmay be heated by photo-ionization of atoms other than hydrogen.\nIn order to cause a significant temperature change, the product of\nthe photo-ionized atom's number density nX and typical ejection\nenergy \u01ebX must be comparable to nH kT . HeII will satisfy this condition before it is reionized; it is abundant and its photo-electrons'\nejection energies are large due both to its high ionization potential\n(see equation 5) and to its optical thickness. The latter means that\nessentially all photons more energetic than the ionization threshold\nwill be absorbed, not merely the lower energy photons whose ionization cross-section is greatest (Abel & Haehnelt 1999). By redshift\nz \u223c 3 the reionization of HeII should be nearly complete, and my neglect of this heating source is justified. It would not be if the redshift\nwere much greater.\n\n\fAdelberger\nTaken together, the results reviewed in this section justify two assumptions that I will adopt for the remainder\nof the paper. (a) If a QSO's luminosity towards solid angle \u03a9 at time t is L(\u03a9, t), then the intensity of the QSO's\nradiation field at position r, \u03a9 at time t + |r|/c will be\nproportional to L(\u03a9, t)/r2 . In other words, intergalactic\ngas at larger distances will not be significantly shielded\nfrom the QSO's radiation by intergalactic gas at smaller\ndistances. (b) The intergalactic temperature will not be\naffected by changes in the intensity of ionizing radiation.\nThis implies first that a blast of radiation from a QSO\nwill alter the ionization balance of intergalactic gas but\nnot its spatial or velocity structure, and second that any\nchanges in neutral fraction will be precisely proportional\nto the change in the ionizing radiation density (equation 3\nwith constant \u03b1HII ) averaged over the last \u223c 104 yr.\n3. MEAN TRANSMISSIVITY VERSUS J\u03bd\n\nWe will be able to measure changes in a QSO's ionizing history with this method only if we can detect spatial\nchanges in the surrounding density of neutral hydrogen.\nIntergalactic HI density is normally measured by fitting\nVoigt profiles to the numerous Lyman-\u03b1 absorption lines in\nthe spectra of background QSOs. This approach is not feasible when the background sources are faint galaxies, since\nindividual Lyman-\u03b1 forest absorption lines are hopelessly\nblended and confused in their noisy low-resolution spectra. Instead we can only hope to measure f \u0304 \u2261 he\u2212\u03c4Ly\u03b1 i,\nthe mean transmissivity along a spectral segment whose\nlength of a few \u00c5 is many times larger than the typical\nabsorption-line spacing but comparable to the instrumental resolution. Although a reliance on f \u0304 is forced on us,\nf \u0304 has two advantages over nHI as a probe of the ionizing\nbackground radiation. First, it receives significant contributions from the parts of the IGM with middling HI\noptical depths \u03c4Ly\u03b1 \u223c 1 whose response to changes in the\nionizing radiation are easiest to measure. In contrast n\u0304HI\nis dominated by systems with large optical depths, and\nsince e\u2212\u03c4 \u2243 e\u22122\u03c4 \u2243 0 for large \u03c4 , big changes in the column densities of optically thick systems can be hard to\ndetect. Second, the value of n\u0304HI along any particular lineof-sight is strongly affected by whether the line happens to\npierce an especially dense system. This adds to n\u0304HI large\nrandom fluctuations that may obscure underlying changes\nin the radiation field. f \u0304 weights more evenly across systems of different column densities and is consequently less\naffected by chance fluctuations in the density of matter, a\npoint that we will elaborate upon in \u00a7 5 below.\nLet us work out, then, how f \u0304 responds to changes in\nthe ionizing background. As argued in \u00a7 2, \u03c4 at fixed total hydrogen density is inversely proportional to the ionizing radiation intensity J, and so if the radiation intensity\nchanges from J to bJ, with b an arbitrary constant, the\nnew mean transmissivity will be\nZ \u221e\nf \u0304 =\nd\u03c4 P (\u03c4 )e\u2212\u03c4 /b\n(5)\n0\n\nwhere P (\u03c4 ) is the Lyman-\u03b1 optical-depth distribution that\nexisted before the change.\nTo estimate P (\u03c4 ), I converted published Lyman-\u03b1 Voigt\nprofile lists for 5 QSOs3 near z = 3 into lists of the ob3 HS1946+7658\n\nfrom Kirkman & Tytler (1997; z = 2.994) and\n\n3\n\nserved Lyman-\u03b1 optical depth \u03c4 vs. comoving distance,\napplied a QSO-dependent scaling to every \u03c4 to make each\nQSO's Lyman-\u03b1 forest have the same mean transmissivity f \u0304 = 0.67 appropriate to z = 3.00 (McDonald et al.\n2001), and finally constructed a histogram of the resulting\n\u03c4 values.\nThe top panel of figure 2 shows the dependence of the\nmean transmissivity on the radiation intensity, calculated\nnumerically from equation 5 using a spline fit to this\nhistogram as an approximation to P (\u03c4 ). Also shown is\n\u2206f \u0304 \u2261 (df \u0304/d lnJQ ), with JQ \u2261 J\u03bd \u2212 Jbg the QSO's contribution to the radiation field. This provides some indication of how strongly f \u0304 responds to large changes in\nJQ . The bottom middle panel presents the J\u03bd \u2013f \u0304 relationship in a slightly different way, as the mean transmissivity\nas a function of distance r from an isotropically radiating\nz = 3.0 QSO with AB magnitude m912 = 18 or m912 = 20\nat rest-frame 912\u00c5 that has been radiating forever at a\nconstant rate. This panel assumes that the background\nradiation field Jbg (equation 2) would have been spatially\nuniform in the absence of the QSO, which implies that the\nactual radiation field is\nh\n\u0010 r \u00112 i\neq\nJ(r) = 1 +\nJbg\n(6)\nr\nwhere\n\ni1/2\nh f /J\n\u03bd\nbg\n,\nreq \u2261 dL (z)\n4\u03c0(1 + z)\n\n(7)\n\nf\u03bd \u2261 10\u22120.4(m912 +48.60) is the flux from the QSO received\non earth at wavelength (1 + z)\u00d7912\u00c5 and dL (z) is the\nQSO's luminosity distance.\nThe top panel implies (for example) that if the mean\ntransmissivity in a given region can be estimated with\nan uncertainty of \u03c3f \u223c 0.04, then a significant change\nto the QSO's luminosity (\u2206lnJQ \u223c 1) will be marginally\ndetectable if the region's distance to the QSO implies an\n<  \u0304<\nf \u223c 0.93.

Adopting the\ncrude approximation tdelay \u223c \u22122r/c leads to the preliminary guess that the method should provide reasonable\nconstraints on the QSO's luminosity for time delays of\n>\n>\n\u221210 \u223c\nt\u223c\n\u221280 Myr. A more careful treatment is deferred\nuntil \u00a7 7.\n4. TIME-DELAY SURFACE\n\nThe actual situation is slightly more complicated than\nFigure 1 suggests, since light from the background sources\ndoes not pass the QSO instantaneously. Instead it encounters material that lies behind the QSO before it encounters\nmaterial that lies in front, and as a result the observed intergalactic absorption from material behind the QSO will\nbe sensitive to the QSO's luminosity at an earlier time. If\nwe define t = 0 as the time when the QSO emitted the\nlight that is just now reaching earth, and if we place the\nQSO at the origin of a polar coordinate system where R\nmeasures proper displacements along the plane of the sky\nand z measures proper displacements in the redshift direction, then the light from a background galaxy passes\nthrough the intergalactic gas that lies a proper distance z\nQ0636+680, Q0956+122, Q0302-003, and Q0014+813 from Hu et\nal.

The transmissivity f \u0304 \u2243 0.67 is\nappropriate to the actual background ionizing-radiation field Jbg .\nIncreases in the radiation intensity destroy neutral hydrogen and\nincrease the transmissivity. The curve shown was calculated with\nequation 5 from Voigt-profile fits to the Lyman-\u03b1 forest at z \u223c 3\n(see text). The dashed line shows \u2206f \u0304 \u2261 (df \u0304/dJ\u03bd )(J\u03bd \u2212 Jbg ), which\nis roughly the change in f \u0304 that would result if the perturbation to\nthe radiation field (i.e., the difference between J\u03bd and Jbg ) were doubled. Bottom panel: the expected intergalactic transmissivity as a\nfunction of distance from a constantly shining QSO with apparent\nAB magnitude m912 = 18 (solid line) or m912 = 20 (dotted line) at\nz = 3.

The figure implies, for example, that the ionization balance of the intergalactic gas\nthat lies 5 Mpc behind the QSO and 2 Mpc to the left will\nreflect the QSO's luminosity at time t = \u221234 Myr, while\nthe material that lies directly in front of the QSO will have\nan ionization balance that reflects the QSO's luminosity at\nt = 0 (i.e., its observed luminosity).\nNow the field of view of a large optical imagers is around\n40\u2032 , or \u223c 19.9h\u22121\n65 proper Mpc at z = 3 (\u03a9M = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7), and the largest optical multi-object spectrograph (Dressler, Sutin, & Bigelow 2003) on an 8m-class\ntelescope is not much smaller. This makes it relatively\neasy to obtain spectra of high-redshift galaxies throughout\nan r \u223c 20\u2032 region centered on a QSO at z = 3, probing\nthe ionization balance of the IGM in the region of this\nplot with \u221210 < R < 10 Mpc. Because more than 1000\n> 3.0 and magnitude\nbackground galaxies with redshift z \u223c\n\nFig. 3.- The time-delay surface. A QSO at the origin\nemits hydrogen-ionizing radiation into the surrounding intergalactic\nmedium. Concentric circles show the distance that has been traveled traveled by the photons emitted by the QSO at the earlier times\nt = \u221210, -20, -30, -40, -50 Myr. Photons from background sources at\nz \u2192 \u221e traverse this region from top to bottom as they travel to earth\nat z \u2192 \u2212\u221e. At each point along the way they pass photons that\nwere emitted by the QSO at a different time in its past. The shaded\ncontours show the emission time of the QSO photons that were illuminating a given intergalactic region when the observed photons\nfrom a background source passed by. The strength of the Lyman-\u03b1\nabsorption lines from this region in the spectrum of the background\nsource will depend on the QSO's luminosity at the indicated time.\nAveraging together the absorption lines from large regions with the\nsame time delay (e.g., the region marked A) can provide a constraint\non the QSO's luminosity at that time. Comparing many such regions\nallows one to chart historical fluctuations in the QSO's luminosity.\nA particularly promising strategy is to estimate the luminosity at\nthe time corresponding to region A (\u223c \u221290 Myr) by comparing the\nabsorption lines in A to the absorption lines in a similar region (B)\non the opposite side of the QSO that is illuminated by QSO photons\nemitted at t \u223c 0. Most systematics will cancel out in this binary\ncomparison. See text.\n\nR \u2264 25.5 will be found in a field of this size with the\n\"UV drop-out\" technique (e.g., Steidel et al. 2003), the\nLyman-\u03b1 absorption lines in these galaxies' spectra can\nin principle provide an enormously detailed view of the\nIGM's ionization balance near the QSO.\nAssume, then, that we have measured the intergalactic\nLyman-\u03b1 transmissivity f \u2261 exp(\u2212\u03c4Ly\u03b1 ) throughout the\nregion of the figure with \u221210 < R < 10 Mpc. A number of\nways to estimate the evolution of the QSO's ionizing luminosity suggest themselves immediately. One is to divide\nthe region behind the QSO (i.e., the region with z > 0\nin figure 3) into a number of bins whose edges align with\ncontours of the time delay surface, then see how the mean\ntransmissivity f \u0304obs in each compares to f \u0304exp , the expected\ntransmissivity if L(t) were constant. Region A in figure 3\nis one such bin. The problem is estimating f \u0304exp . This\nsuggests a slight variation: compare f \u0304obs in each bin to\nf \u0304con , the mean transmissivity in a bin of the same shape\n\n\fAdelberger\nlocated on the opposite side of the QSO. See (e.g.) regions\nA and B in the figure. Since A is illuminated by photons\nemitted at t \u223c \u221280 Myr and B is illuminated by pho<\ntons emitted at \u221210Myr \u223c\nt < 0, the difference in their\nmean transmissivities will be sensitive to the any differences in the QSO's luminosity at those two times. This\napproach is also not ideal, since the mean transmissivity\nin the control region (B) is an unnecessarily noisy indica< t < 0; only\ntor of the QSO's luminosity at time \u221210Myr \u223c\na small fraction of the volume illuminated by the QSO's\n< t < 0 falls in region B. The best\nluminosity at \u221210Myr \u223c\napproach is probably to find a maximum-likelihood fit of\nthe data to an appropriate surface. Since the results of\nunbinned maximum-likelihood fits are harder to present\nin a simple graphical way, however, I will continue with a\npaired-bin analysis for the remainder of this paper but will\nmake one assumption that should cause the estimated uncertainties to more closely resemble those of a maximumlikelihood fit: I will assume that the uncertainties in mean\ntransmissivities of the control bins are negligibly small.\nIn other words, I will assume that the uncertainty in the\nmean transmissivity in region B of figure 3 is small compared to the uncertainty for region A. The justification is\nthat random fluctuations in B can be removed to a large\nextent by analyzing the large volume illuminated by the\n< t < 0.4\nQSO's luminosity at \u221210Myr \u223c\nThe fact that so large a region is illuminated by light\nemitted at t \u223c 0 is crucial to the success of this approach,\nsince it allows historical changes in the ionizing luminosity\nto be measured by comparing regions that are distributed\nsymmetrically about the QSO. Various systematics (e.g.,\nthe r\u22122 decrease in flux from the QSO, bipolar beaming,\nerrors in the continuum fits to the background galaxies'\nspectra, peculiar velocities, gradients in the matter density, and so on) should also be symmetric about the QSO,\nat least in cosmic average, and so they will cancel out in\na front-to-back comparison of the HI absorption. No systematic that I can think of will have a shape that resembles\nthe time delay surface in much detail.\nThe closest candidate might be the gradual expansion\nof the universe, which causes the intergalactic material behind the QSO to be slightly denser than the material in\nfront, changing the recombination time and producing a\nslight systematic gradient in the intergalactic HI density\nalong the line of sight. This gradient could mimic a brightening QSO. The change in expansion scale factor as light\ntraverses a region of proper length 40 Mpc at z = 3.0 is\n\u223c 4% (\u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.65), and the corresponding change in mean transmissivity of the IGM is\n\u2206f \u0304 \u223c 0.035 (e.g., McDonald et al. 2000). \u2206f \u0304 \u223c 0.035\nis comparable to the smallest radiation-related change we\nmight hope to measure (see below), so this effect cannot be\n4 It\n\nmay help to illustrate this point with a concrete example.\nHere is a crude recipe for reducing the noise in the control bins: fit\na low-order polynomial to a plot of the mean transmissivity in each\ncontrol bin versus the bin's distance to the QSO, then use the value\nof this function in each bin as the control transmissivity, rather than\nthe measured transmissivity itself. Since we know a priori that the\nmean transmissivity in the control bins ought to be a smoothly and\nmonotonically declining function of distance to the QSO, deviations\nfrom this behavior must be noise. They can be largely removed with\nthe polynomial fit. Maximum-likelihood fitting of a surface to the\nunbinned data is a more sophisticated implementation of the same\nidea.\n\n5\n\nignored. One way to shrink it to insignificance is to divide\neach measured transmissivity by hf \u0304i(z), the global mean\ntransmissivity at its redshift. I will assume below that\nevery transmissivity f has been rescaled in a way (e.g.,\ndivided by hf \u0304i(z) and then multiplied by hf \u0304i(3) = 0.67)\nthat makes this effect negligible.\n5. UNCERTAINTIES\n\nSuppose that we have divided the intergalactic volume\nsurrounding the QSO into different spatial bins, each one\nilluminated by the light emitted by the QSO at a different\nperiod ti < t < ti + \u2206t in its past, and that we would\nlike to use the mean Lyman-\u03b1 transmissivity f \u0304 \u2261 he\u2212\u03c4Ly\u03b1 i\nin each bin to measure how the QSO's ionizing luminosity has evolved over time. How reliably can we do this?\n\u00a7 3 discussed the relationship between f \u0304 and the intensity\nof the radiation field. This section is concerned the uncertainty in our estimate of f \u0304. The interpretation of f \u0304 is\nsubject to further uncertainties, primarily related to our\nignorance of the QSO's true proper distance z and to our\nassumption that its ionizing radiation is emitted isotropically. The discussion of these will be deferred until \u00a7\u00a7 8\nand 9.\n5.1. Arithmetic\nConsider a single spatial bin, for example the volume\nmarked A in figure 3, that is being photoionized at the\nunknown rate \u0393\u03b3,A . Let f \u0304obs be the mean Lyman-\u03b1 transmissivity we measure along the sight-line segments that\npass through A, and let f \u0304true be the mean transmissivity\nthat would be measured in an arbitrarily large intergalactic volume subjected to the same radiation field. f \u0304obs and\nf \u0304true will differ because (1) our spectra of the background\nsources are noisy, (2) we cannot measure the transmissivity throughout the volume A but must instead rely on an\nuncertain guess from the few thinly scattered probes that\nbackground sources supply, and (3) A is not necessarily a\nfair sample of the universe and could have a mean transmissivity that differs from f \u0304true for reasons unrelated to\nthe intensity of ionizing radiation, e.g., if the random fluctuations from inflation gave it an unusually high or low\ndensity of matter.\nFor simplicity I will obtain estimates of the variance\nfrom (1)\u2013(3) by approximating the actual spatial bin A\nas the volume V that lies between two identically shaped\nparallel surfaces that are separated by distance lz (see figure 4).

The intergalactic volume V is\npierced by lines-of-sight to many background sources. V is a generalized right cylinder of height lz whose cross-section has the arbitrary\nshape S. Light from the background sources at the top of the figure\nmoves parallel to the z axis, and normal to S, as it makes its way\nto towards earth, far below the bottom of the figure. The N background sources have (x, y) positions that are randomly distributed\nwithin S.\n\nThe first source of uncertainty, measurement errors, will\nsimply add in quadrature to the others. To understand\nhow the second and third sources contribute to the total uncertainty, consider a given set C of random galaxy\npositions {x, y}, which can be represented\nas a sum of\nP\nDirac delta functions, C = (1/N ) j \u03b4(x \u2212 xj )\u03b4(y \u2212 yj ).6\n(The factor of 1/N indicates our decision to average rather\nthan sum the mean transmissivities from different galaxies.) Equation 12 implies that the variance of f \u0304 (i.e., of the\n6 Since\n\ngalaxies are spatially extended, C should actually be the\nsum of functions with finite width, not the sum of delta functions.\nThe delta-function approximation assumes that the bright part of\neach galaxy is small compared to the coherence length of intergalactic\nabsorption. This appears to be the case at z \u223c 3.\n\nThe N (N \u2212 1) terms in this sum with l 6= m are each\nequal to |WS (kx , ky )|2 , the powerspectrum of S, while\nthe N terms with l = m are each equal to unity. Substitution into equation 13 shows that the expected variance from the second and third sources of uncertainty\nis a linear combination of the variance in a volume of\nshape V and the variance along a line segment of length\n2\nlz : \u03c32,3\n= NN\u22121 \u03c3V2 + N1 \u03c3l2 . This pleasantly simple result makes intuitive sense. As N \u2192 \u221e, sightlines to\nthe background objects sample almost every part of the\nvolume V . The mean transmissivity along the sightlines\napproaches the mean transmissivity within V arbitrarily\nclosely and f \u0304obs becomes as reliable an estimator of f \u0304true\nas the volume-averaged transmissivity itself. In the opposite limit, N = 1, the volume is pierced by a single\nskewer. In this case the footprint S of the volume (and\ntherefore \u03c3V ) becomes irrelevant; the mean transmissivity\nalong the skewer is determined by physics on the other\nside of the universe, not by anything that influences S\n(e.g., our choice of telescope, instrument, pointing, etc.),\nand there is no reason that the variance of the transmissivity along this sightline segment should be any different\nthan the variance of a similar segment that is randomly\nplaced.\nAdding in the variance from measurement errors to the\n2\nabove expression for \u03c32,3\n, we arrive at our final expression\nfor the total variance of f \u0304:\n\u03c3f2 \u0304 =\n\nN \u22121 2\n1\n1 \u0010 f \u0304true \u00112\n.\n\u03c3V + \u03c3l2 +\nN\nN\nN\nS\n\n(16)\n\nIt remains to find numerical values for the constants \u03c3l2\nand \u03c3V2 .\n7 in\n\nthe limit of weak angular clustering\n\n\fAdelberger\nHigh signal-to-noise QSO spectra can provide a robust\nempirical estimate of the variance of the mean transmissivity along a line segment of length lz .

Since the time-delay surface\n(\u00a7 4) has rotational symmetry about the z axis, cylindrical\nbins are a natural choice for the analysis.\n\nFig. 5.- The r.m.s. variation of the normalized transmissivity\nf \u0304/hf \u0304i(z) along skewers of different lengths. Points with error bars\nare for the 7 primary QSOs from Adelberger et al. (2003); the shaded\ncurve is the prediction of equations 17 and 10. The observed values\nat the largest l are unreliable due to uncertainties in the continuum\nfitting.\n\n\u03c3V2 is more difficult. It depends on the three-dimensional\npower-spectrum of the Lyman-\u03b1 forest, which has not been\nmeasured due to a lack of close QSO pairs. A rough estimate of \u03c3V2 can be obtained by scaling from \u03c3l2 , \u03c3V2 \u2261 \u03b2\u03c3l2 ,\nwith \u03b2 a constant that can be estimated by assuming a\nshape for the powerspectrum and numerically integrating equations 10 and 11. According to McDonald (2003),\nthe transmissivity powerspectra found in numerical simulations the high-redshift intergalactic medium have the\nform\ni2\nh\n(17)\nP (kR , kz ) \u221d 1 + \u03b2kz2 /k 2 PL (k)D(kR , kz )\n\nwhere kz and kR specify the wavenumber in polar coordi2\nnates, k 2 \u2261 kz2 + kR\n, PL (k) is the linear powerspectrum of\ncold dark matter,\nh\u0010 k \u0011\u03b1nl \u0010 k \u0011\u03b1p \u0010 k \u0011\u03b1v i\nz\nD(kR , kz ) \u2261 exp\n\u2212\n\u2212\n, (18)\nknl\nkp\nkv (k)\n\u2032\n\nand kv (k) \u2261 (1 + k/kv\u2032 )\u03b1v kv0 . McDonald (2003) supplies values for the numerical constants in these equations appropriate to redshift z \u223c 2. Adjusting his values\nslightly, to \u03b2 = 1.73, knl = 5.2, \u03b1nl = 0.673, kp = 8.51,\n\u03b1p = 1.14, kv0 = 0.603, kv\u2032 = 0.085, \u03b1\u2032v = 0.432, \u03b1v = 1.59,\nand adopting a \u0393 = 0.2 linear powerspectrum with a\nPL (k) \u221d k 0.95 long-wavelength limit (Bardeen et al. 1986),\nI find a transmissivity powerspectrum that correctly predicts both the observed dependence of \u03c3l2 on lz at redshift\nz = 3 (figure 5) and the observed one-dimensional\ntransR\nmissivity powerspectrum P 1D (kz ) \u2261 2\u03c0 dkR kR P (kR , kz )\nat redshift z = 3 (figure 6). This model powerspectrum is\npresumably a reasonable approximation to the true powerspectrum. Integrating it numerically in the following\n\nFig. 6.- The one-dimensional power-spectrum of the Lyman-\u03b1\nforest. Points are from the observations of McDonald et al. (2001);\nthe shaded curve is the prediction of equation 17.\n\nA more sophisticated treatment would take into account\nthe changes to the power-spectrum that will accompany\nchanges in the ionizing radiation intensity. That will likely\nrequire numerical simulations and is beyond the scope\nof this paper. However, since changes in the radiation\nfield alter the neutral fraction but not the temperature\nof intergalactic gas (see \u00a7 2), they will have a stronger\neffect on the amplitude of the powerspectrum than on\nits shape. Amplitude-independent results (e.g., our estimate of \u03c3V2 /\u03c3l2 ) may not be disastrously affected. Figure 7 presents some evidence in favor of this assertion.\nI converted published Lyman-\u03b1 Voigt profile lists for the\nQSOs HS1946+7658 (Kirkman & Tytler 1997, z = 2.994),\nQ0636+680, Q0956+122, Q0302-003, and Q0014+813 (Hu\net al. 1995, z = 3.180, 3.288, 3.294, 3.366) into a list of\neach QSO's Lyman-\u03b1 optical depth as a function of redshift, divided all the optical depths by a constant b to\nmimic a change in the ionizing radiation intensity, then\ncalculated the dependence of \u03c3l on l for various values of\nb. The top panel of figure 7 shows the result. The amplitude of \u03c3l changes significantly with b, but its shape,\nwhich is sensitive to the shape of the powerspectrum, does\nnot. This can be seen more clearly in the bottom panel,\n\n\f8\n\nMeasuring the Radiative Histories of QSOs\n\nwhere the change in amplitude has been crudely removed\nby scaling each curve according to the relationship\n\u03c3l \u221d [1 \u2212 f \u0304(b)]0.43\n\n(21)\n\nwhere f \u0304(b) is the mean transmissivity after dividing the\nactual optical depths by b.

Commentary\nIt is worth considering the relative sizes of the terms in\nequation 16 before we move on. Suppose for concreteness\nthat we are interested in measuring changes in the QSO's\nluminosity over 10Myr time-scales, so we have estimated\nthe mean transmissivity in bins of depth lz \u223c 1.5 proper\nMpc, and suppose further that the radius R of our bins\nwas chosen to fill the 40\u2032 field-of-view of a mosaicked CCD\ncamera, R \u223c 10 proper Mpc at z = 3 for \u03a9M = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.65. In comoving units the bin has R =\n26h\u22121 Mpc and lz = 3.9h\u22121 Mpc, which implies \u03c3l \u2243 0.17\n(figure 5, for f \u0304 = 0.67), \u03c3l2 /\u03c3V2 \u2243 20, and consequently\n\u03c3V \u2243 0.04. Inserting these numbers into equation 16 leads\nto the two primary conclusions of this section:\n(A) The spectra of the background objects do not need\nto be very good. The second and third terms in equation 16 contribute equally to the total uncertainty when\nthe signal-to-noise ratio in a spectral segment of length\n\nlz \u223c 3.9h\u22121 comoving Mpc (\u223c 7\u00c5) is S = f \u0304/\u03c3l \u223c 4. Obtaining better spectra cannot change the total uncertainty\nby much. Random variations in the intergalactic matter\ndensity make the mean HI absorption f \u03041 along a single\nsightline segment a poor indicator of the ionizing background J\u03bd and consequently there is no need to measure\nf \u03041 with exquisite precision.\n(B) The ultimate limit on our uncertainty is set by \u03c3V\nand it is a limit that we will reach very quickly. For the\nexample considered here, the first and second terms in\nequation 16 have the same size for N = 20. Increasing\nN further can reduce the second and third terms arbitrarily but not the total uncertainty. In practice one will\nwant to obtain samples many times larger than N = 20\nto help address the possibility that the QSO's radiation\nis beamed. As a result \u03c3V will probably be the only significant contributor to \u03c3f in realistic cases. The bottom\npanel of figure 2 shows that \u03c3V is large enough to prevent\nus from detecting all but the coarsest changes in a QSO's\nluminosity. We can do nothing about this. Only a small\nregion of the universe is bathed in the light that the QSO\nemitted at one period in its history; the mean density in\nthis region will stray from the global mean to the extent\nthat inflation requires; the intensity of the QSO's ionizing\nradiation cannot be measured if it influences the region's\nmean HI absorption by less.\nAlthough the numbers quoted above depend on our arbitrary choice for the bin size, neither \u03c3l nor \u03c3V is a strong\nenough function of R or l for the qualitative conclusions to\nchange significantly as the bin size varies across its useful\nrange. The change of variance with mean transmissivity\n(equation 21) might seem more important. If the QSO\nwere bright enough to drive the mean transmissivity in a\nbin to f \u0304 \u223c 0.9, for example, rather than the value f \u0304 \u223c 0.67\nassumed in the preceding three paragraphs, \u03c3l would decrease to 0.10, \u03c3V would decrease to 0.02, and one would\nfind that spectra of slightly higher S:N were desirable. In\npractice, however, these high transmissivities are unlikely\nto be reached anywhere except very near the QSO, and\nhere the decrease in \u03c3l and \u03c3V is largely offset by the\nsmall bin sizes that are required at small radii. This can\nbe seen in the worked example of \u00a7 7, below.\nOne qualification should be added to my claim (A) that\nit is a waste of time to obtain high S:N spectra. That is\nnecessarily true only if one is committed to using the mean\ntransmissivity f \u0304 as a probe of the radiation density J\u03bd . At\nsufficiently high signal-to-noise ratios, however, other options are available. Consider an arbitrary function g of the\nline-of-sight HI density that has variance \u03c3g2 due to random\nfluctuations when the brightness b \u2261 J\u03bd /Jbg of the ionizing radiation field is kept constant. The random fluctuations in g will prevent us from detecting relative changes\nin b of order \u2206lnb \u223c |d lnb/d lng|\u03c3g /g. If g is the mean\ntransmissivity f \u0304 on a 3.9h\u22121 comoving Mpc line segment,\nwhich is the only possibility we have treated so far, then\nd lnb/d lng \u223c 5 (near g = 0.67) and \u03c3g /g \u223c 0.26, so the\nminimum detectable fluctuation in b will have \u2206lnb \u223c 1.3.\nAt high enough S:N it would be possible abandon f \u0304 and\nadopt (say) the total HI column-density N along the same\nline segment as the probe of b. In this case, with g = N ,\nwe have d lnb/d lng \u2243 \u22121 and \u03c3g /g \u223c 6, where \u03c3g /g is\nthe value that obtains among the 5 QSOs with z \u223c 3\n\n\fAdelberger\n\n9\n\ndiscussed at the end of \u00a7 5.1, so the minimum detectable\nfluctuation in b has \u2206lnb \u223c 6. N is evidently far inferior\nto f \u0304 as an estimator of b. A better choice, letting g equal\nn, the number of detected Lyman-\u03b1 forest lines on the\nsegment, was advocated by Bajtlik, Duncan, & Ostriker\n(1988). If the column density distribution has the form\n\u2212\u03b1\nP (NHI ) \u221d NHI\n, then d lnb/d lng \u2243 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u22121 . Among\nthe same 5 QSOs, \u03c3n /n \u2243 0.5 for line segments of length\n3.9h\u22121 comoving Mpc, so the minimum detectable fluctuation in b has \u2206lnb \u223c 1 for the observed slope \u03b1 \u223c 1.5.\nSurprisingly, n is only marginally better than f \u0304 as an estimator of J\u03bd . The mean transmissivity f \u0304 along a segment\nof a low S:N galaxy spectrum can provide almost as strong\na constraint on the intensity of the QSO's radiation as a\nhigh S:N spectrum analyzed with the standard approach\nof Bajtlik, Duncan, & Ostriker (1988). It would be interesting to extend this analysis from \u03c3l to the more relevant\nquantity \u03c3V . Since the ratio \u03c3l /\u03c3V depends on the powerspectrum, and different estimators g will have different\npowerspectra, it is not necessarily true that the best estimator for \u03c3l will be best for \u03c3V . This method would be\nmade far more powerful if one could finding an estimator\nthat significantly reduces \u03c3V .\n6. FEASIBILITY\n\nThe previous section glibly claimed that observational\nuncertainties can be made smaller than cosmic variance.\nThis section considers the claim in more detail. The optimal depth for the spatial bins is \u223c 7\u00c5, corresponding\nroughly to 10 Myr time resolution (see \u00a7 8), and for the\nfields-of-view considered here the cosmic variance will consequently be \u03c3V \u223c 0.04 (see \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7). This is the level to\nwhich we must reduce the observational uncertainty \u03c3noise .\n6.1. Signal\nReducing the random errors to the desired level \u03c3noise \u223c\n0.04 is not much of a challenge. Figure 8 shows spectra\nwith \u223c 10\u00c5 resolution of three galaxies in the field SSA22a\n(Steidel et al. 2003) that were observed for \u223c 29000s with\nthe blue LRIS spectrograph (Steidel et al. 2004) on the\nKeck I telescope. The redshifts and AB-magnitudes of the\ngalaxies (z \u223c 3.1 and G \u223c 24.5, respectively) are shown\non the plot. The spectra are preliminary reductions that\nwere selected more-or-less at random from the sample of\nShapley et al. (2004, in preparation). These spectra have\nsignal-to-noise ratios in the Lyman-\u03b1 forest, for 7\u00c5 bins\n(\u223c 1.5 proper Mpc), of around 5\u20136. Averaging together\n\u223c 10 spectra of similar quality would reduce the random\nerrors to the desired level. Roughly forty spectra would\nbe required if the exposure time were 2 hours instead of 8.\n6.2. Continuum fitting\nSystematic errors in the continuum fitting are a source\nof greater concern. We are interested not in a spectrum's\nflux itself but rather in its implied Lyman-\u03b1 transmissivity,\nwhich is the ratio between the observed flux and the continuum flux, i.e., the flux that would have been observed\nin the absence of Lyman-\u03b1 absorption. The uncertainty\nin a bin's mean transmissivity therefore has an additional\nterm that arises from errors in the estimated continuum.\nThe size of these errors depends on the method that is\nused to estimate the continuum level. Traditional methods are poorly suited to the present case; they exploit the\n\nFig. 8.- Examples of the Lyman-\u03b1 forest in the spectra of galaxies at redshift z \u223c 3. The data were taken with LRIS-B (Steidel et\nal. 2004) and were generously provided by A. E. Shapley. Redshifts\nand AB magnitudes are indicated; the names (\"C11\" etc.) refer to\nthe SSA22a catalog of Steidel et al. (2003). Asterisks mark the locations of the interstellar absorption lines discussed in figure 10, below.\nDashed lines indicated the wavelengths of Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman-\u03b2 at\nthe redshift of the galaxies' interstellar absorption lines.\n\noccasional presence of spectral regions with little Lyman\u03b1 absorption, and these regions are rare and difficult to\nrecognize in noisy, low-resolution galaxy spectra. Several\nauthors (e.g., Hui et al. 2001) have presented alternatives that are more useful to us. Particularly simple is the\nmethod of Croft (2004), in which the continuum level c(\u03bb)\nis estimated by simply smoothing each object's spectrum\nand scaling appropriately: c(\u03bb) \u2243 f50 (\u03bb)/f \u0304(z), where\nf50 (\u03bb) is the object's Lyman-\u03b1 forest spectrum smoothed\nby a Gaussian with \u03c3 = 50\u00c5 and f \u0304(z) is the published\nmean transmissivity at redshift z = \u03bb/\u03bbLy\u03b1 \u2212 1, which has\nbeen calculated by other authors from more-sophisticated\ncontinuum fits to the observed spectra of numerous bright\nQSOs.\nExperimentation on the 7 QSOs with z \u223c 3 in the sample of Adelberger et al. (2003) shows that transmissivities estimated with Croft's (2004) approach and the traditional approach are very similar. Excluding the parts of\nthe Lyman-\u03b1 forest that fall on the QSOs' Lyman-\u03b1 and\nLyman-\u03b2 emission lines, the correlation coefficient between\nthe transmissivities estimated with the two approaches is\nr \u223c 0.96\u20130.98. This implies that the r.m.s. difference between them, (1 \u2212 r2 )1/2 \u03c3l , is \u223c 0.03\u20130.05 for 7\u00c5 bins with\n\u03c3l \u2243 0.17 (see Figure 5). Since galaxies' and QSOs' continua between Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman-\u03b2 are similarly featureless (see, e.g., figures 8, 9, and 10), errors in continuum\nfitting should introduce a similar uncertainty in galaxies'\nLyman-\u03b1 forest transmissivities. Even if these errors were\ncorrelated from one galaxy to the next, and did not tend to\ncancel in the averaged transmissivity in each spatial bin,\n\n\f10\n\nMeasuring the Radiative Histories of QSOs\n\ntheir size would be no larger than the cosmic variance. In\npractice continuum errors from the Croft (2004) approach\nshould cancel significantly, however. They arise, to a large\nextent, because the Lyman-\u03b1 forest is not completely uniform on \u223c 100\u00c5 scales and any deviations from uniformity\nare incorrectly interpreted as features of the continuum.\nThe resulting r.m.s. continuum error averaged over a spatial bin can be calculated with the approach of \u00a7 5:\n\u03c3cont \u2243\n2\n\n\u0014\n\n1 2\nN \u2212 1 \u20322\n\u03c3 V + \u03c3\u2032 l\nN\nN\n\n\u00151/2\n\n(22)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03c3 \u2032 V and \u03c3 \u2032 l are given by equations 11 and 10 with\nsin(kz lz /2)/(kz lz /2) replaced by exp[\u2212kz2 \u03c3z2 /2], where \u03c3z\nis the comoving distance corresponding to the 50\u00c5 smoothing length. Since \u03c3z \u226b lz , \u03c3 \u2032 2V will be smaller than \u03c3V2 ,\n2\n\u03c3 \u2032 l will be smaller than \u03c3l2 , and the uncertainty from this\nsource of continuum errors will never dominate the total\nuncertainty. This is true even in the low signal-to-noise\nlimit, since in this case the uncertainty in the smoothed\ncontinuum will be dwarfed by the uncertainty in a single\n\u223c 7\u00c5 bin.\n\nFig. 10.- Mean absorption vs. wavelength for galaxies at redshift\nz \u223c 3. The shaded curve shows the mean spectrum of 811 galaxies at\nz \u223c 3; the data are taken from Shapley et al. (2003). Lyman-\u03b1 forest\nfluctuations cancel out in this average, producing a smooth shelf\nwith mean transmissivity f \u0304 \u223c 0.67 between Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman\u03b2. Absorption lines in this shelf are produced by material intrinsic\nto the galaxies. This interstellar absorption can be safely ignored\nwhen its rest-frame equivalent width is less than \u223c 0.3\u00c5(see text).\nStronger lines have been marked with vertical labels naming the ion\nresponsible for the absorption. Data at these wavelengths should\nbe excluded when calculating the mean transmissivity in different\nspatial bins. Note that the resolution of this spectrum (\u223c 12\u00c5) is\nsomewhat lower than the 7\u00c5 resolution advocated in the text.\n\nwhich shows average observed absorption in region between Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman-\u03b2 in a sample of 811 Lymanbreak galaxies (Shapley et al. 2003). Since the r.m.s. variation in Lyman-\u03b1 forest transmissivity in 7\u00c5 bins is\n\u03c3l \u2243 0.17 (Figure 5), interstellar absorption lines will have\na non-negligible effect on the estimated transmissivity if\ntheir rest-frame equivalent width exceeds 7\u00c5\u00d7\u03c3l /(1+z) \u2243\n0.3\u00c5. In the mean spectrum of Shapley et al. (2003) there\nare 7 such lines between Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman-\u03b2. The existence of these interstellar absorption lines will not have\na disastrous effect on the analysis, since each background\ngalaxy will lie at a slightly different redshift, but one might\nas well eliminate their effect completely by masking the\nrelevant portions of the spectrum. This will reduce the\neffective number of background galaxies by too modest an\namount to significantly alter the significance of any conclusions.\n7.

Both\nspectra were taken with the same instrument, though the signal-tonoise ratio for the bright QSO is significantly higher. Asterisks in\nthe top panel mark the locations of the interstellar absorption lines\ndiscussed in figure 10, below.\n\n6.3. Interstellar absorption lines\nAlthough galaxies' continua appear to be mostly featureless between Lyman-\u03b1 and Lyman-\u03b2, there are some\nimportant exceptions: at a handful of wavelengths the\ngalaxies' interstellar absorption lines are too strong to be\nignored. These wavelengths are apparent in figure 10,\n\nWe can now estimate how easily we will be able to detect ionization gradients produced by changes in a QSO's\nluminosity. This section works through the details for a\nsingle case, an isotropically radiating QSO of (t = 0) magnitude m912 = 18 whose ionizing luminosity varied with\ntime according to the curve L(t) shown in the top panel\nof figure 11. An \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.65 cosmology\nwith the uniform ionizing background of equation 2 will\nbe assumed throughout this section.\nAccording to equation 6, the radiation intensity as a\nfunction of position in the observed frame (i.e., the radiation intensity that was present when the photons from the\nbackground sources passed through each point) is\nh\nL(tI (R, z)) \u0010 req \u00112 i\nJbg\n(23)\nJ(R, z) = 1 +\nL(0)\nr\nwhere tI (R, z) and req are given by equations 7 and 8.

The solid curve shows the mean transmissivity\nthan would have been observed if the QSO's luminosity were constant, L(t) = L(0). The dotted curve shows the mean transmissivity\nin the primed \"control\" bins (figure 12); it differs from the solid line\ndue to the increase in the QSO's luminosity from t = 0 to t = \u221210,\nthough this effect would presumably be removed by a maximum likelihood fit of the data to a surface. Decreases of the luminosity to 0\nand subsequent increases back to L(0) can be detected with mod< <\nerate significance if they happened within the interval \u221250 \u223c\nt\u223c0\nMyr. Only extremely large increases in the QSO's luminosity can be\ndetected at earlier times.\n\nproper Mpc, which is appropriate to the QSO described in\nthe preceding paragraph. Since the ionization and recombination times (\u00a7 2) are short compared to the time for\nsignificant changes in L(t), the neutral fraction will be inversely proportional to J(R, z), and the mean corresponding transmissivity f (R, z) can be derived from the curve\nshown in the top panel of figure 2. The result is shown\nin the right panel of figure 12. The panel shows the mean\ntransmissivity that would be observed if one averaged results from many identical QSOs; the actual transmissivity\nsurrounding a single QSO would have significant variations\nabout this mean, due primarily to random fluctuations in\nthe density of intergalactic matter.\nChanges in the QSO's ionizing luminosity could be detected in various ways, but for now I will assume that one\nis aiming to detect the changes by looking for differences in\nthe mean transmissivity f \u0304bin among bins whose edges trace\ncontours of the time delay surface tI (R, z). One set of such\nbins is shown in the left panel of figure 12. Also indicated\nare symmetrically distributed \"control\" bins. These bins\nhave shapes identical to the others, but are located on the\nopposite side of the QSO, in a region that is illuminated\n\n11\n\nFig. 12.- Left panel: variations in the intensity of ionizing\nradiation in the observed frame for a QSO at redshift z = 3 with\nm912 = 18 that has the history of outbursts shown in figure 11. Also\nshown are sample bins used in the analysis at larger lookback times.\nRight panel: variations in the expected mean transmissivity implied\nby the radiation intensity of the left panel. The mean transmissivity\nwould hew to these values only if results from numerous identical\nQSOs were averaged. A more realistic single realization would show\nlarge fluctuations in the transmissivity due to random variations in\nthe density of intergalactic matter. The labeled regions surrounding\nthe QSO are sample bins for the analysis at smaller lookback times.\n\nby the QSO's radiation at short time delays 0 > t > \u221210\nMyr. The mean transmissivity in these bins provides an\nindication of how the mean transmissivity for z > 0 would\nvary with position if the QSO's luminosity were always\nequal to its observed (t = 0) value(\u00a7 4). Note that the\nrequirement t > \u221210 Myr for the control bins limits the\nsize of their partner bins at smaller radii.\nOur ability to detect changes in the QSO's luminosity\nwill depend on the uncertainty in the binned transmissivity f \u0304bin . For a reasonable number of background sources\n> few dozen) this uncertainty will be nearly equal to the\n(\u223c\ncosmic variance \u03c3V (\u00a7 5). As discussed in \u00a7 5, the size of \u03c3V\ncan be roughly estimated by (1) approximating each bin\nas a cylinder of radius Rbin and depth lbin , (2) calculating\nr.m.s. transmissivity fluctuation along a skewer of length\nlbin by interpolating from figure 5 and scaling according to\nthe local expected transmissivity f (R, z) with equation 21,\nand (3) multiplying by \u03b2 1/2 , where \u03b2(Rbin , lbin ) \u2261 \u03c3V2 /\u03c3l2\nis a constant that can be determined for each bin by numerically integrating equations 10, 19, and 17. The bottom panel of figure 11 shows the expected mean transmissivity in each bin along with the estimated 1\u03c3 uncertainty\ncalculated in this way.\nThe main conclusions from figure 11 are (1) that only\nlarge changes in the QSO's luminosity will leave an imprint\non the IGM that is easily detectable with this approach,\nand (2) that the minimum size of a detectable luminosity\n\n\f12\n\nMeasuring the Radiative Histories of QSOs\n\ndifference increases rapidly towards earlier times. These\nconclusions are easier to apprehend in figure 13, which\nshows the 10-Myr moving-average magnitude m\u0304912 a QSO\nwould need to have had at various lookback times to for\nits sudden death (or revival) to leave a detectable fossil\nrecord in the spectra of background galaxies. Measuring\n<\nchanges in a QSO's luminosity will be difficult for t \u223c\n\u221250\n<\nMyr and nearly impossible for t \u223c \u2212 100 Myr. At smaller\ntime delays the prognosis is good.\n\nFig. 13.- The 10Myr running-average luminosity required at\nvarious lookback times for the flux in the corresponding 10Myr bin to\nbe N \u03c3 above the background level. Luminosity changes among even\nthe brightest QSOs will be difficult to detect at moderate significance\n<\nfor t \u223c\n\u2212 100 Myr.\n\nAs t \u2192 0, the shape of the time-delay contours becomes\nincreasingly incompatible with the goal of having symmet< t < 0 the best approach may\nrical control bins. For \u221220 \u223c\n\u223c\nbe to abandon the binning altogether and simply find the\nmaximum likelihood fit of the data to an appropriate surface. To give some indication of the uncertainty in the radiative history that would result, however, I will continue\na binned analysis with the bins shown in the right panel of\nfigure 12. The outermost bins (B\u2013BBB) enclose regions\nwith time delays \u221220 < t < \u221210 Myr, the middle bins\n(A\u2013AAA) enclose \u221210 < t < \u22123.5 Myr, and the innermost\n(AB \u2032 etc.) enclose \u22123.5 < t < 0 Myr. A complication for\nthese small time delays is that a region with fixed t has a\nwide range of distances r to the QSO. Variations in f \u0304 due\nto changes in 1/r2 could obscure the variations of interest\nfrom changes in the QSO luminosity L(t). My approach in\nthis simplified analysis is to divide each time-delay region\ninto a number of bins with similar values of r (e.g., bins\nB, BB, and BBB for \u221220 < t < \u221210 Myr). Figure 14\nshows the mean transmissivity within each of these bins.\nThe uncertainty in the bins was calculated by approximating them as cylinders (B, AB \u2032 , AABB \u2032 , AAABBB \u2032 ) or\ncylindrical annuli (A\u2013AAA, B\u2013BBB) with the same volume and roughly the same shape; the expected variance\n\ndoes not depend sensitively on the details of this approximation.\n\nFig. 14.- The mean transmissivity and its uncertainty in the\nbins shown in the right panel of figure 12. Bins with the lightest\nshading are bathed in light emitted by the QSO at \u22123.5Myr < t < 0;\nbins with medium shading by light emitted at \u221210 < t < \u22123.5Myr;\nbins with darkest shading by \u221220 < t < \u221210Myr. The height of\nthe bins corresponds to the mean transmissivity \u00b11\u03c3. Bin names\nin this figure correspond to those in figure 12. Bins with 1 < r <\n2Mpc are unlabeled in figure 12 for clarity. At fixed time delay, f \u0304\ndeclines with radius due to the 1/r 2 decline in flux from the QSO.\nComparing f \u0304 radius by radius clearly reveals the decline in L(t)\n(figure 11) from \u221210Myr < t < 0 to \u221220 < t < \u221210Myr. The\nincrease from \u22123.5Myr < t < 0 to \u221210 < t < \u22123.5Myr would not\nbe easy to detect; a decrease during the same times would have been\ndetected with high significance.\n\nWith these bins, the decrease in L(t) from \u221210 < t < 0\nMyr to \u221220 < t < \u221210 Myr is detected with some significance at each radius and with high significance when the\nresults from different radii are combined. If the decrease\n< \u2212 3.5 Myr\nhad happened at an earlier time \u221210 < t \u223c\nit would have been detected with higher significance still.\nInstead the luminosity increased from \u22123.5Myr < t < 0\n< \u2212 3.5. As the plot shows, increases in the\nto \u221210 < t \u223c\nluminosity at small look-back times are much harder to\ndetect than decreases, since the sensitivity of f \u0304 to JQ falls\nas f \u0304 \u2192 1 (figure 2). Fortunately decreases must be far\nmore likely than increases: QSOs with m912 = 18 lie on\nthe steep bright-end of the luminosity function.\n8. LIMITS TO THE TIME RESOLUTION\n\nIn the previous sections the data were placed into spatial bins whose depth lz = 1.5 Mpc gave us sensitivity to\nluminosity fluctuations time-scales of 10 Myr or greater.\nIdeally one would be able to detect fluctuations on any\ntime scale. Could we have achieved significantly better\ntime resolution by placing the data in bins with smaller\nlz ? The answer is no; this section explains why.\nIf cosmic variance were the only problem, the bin depth\n\n\fAdelberger\nlz could be made arbitrarily small. \u03c3V (equation 19) is\nalmost independent of lz for lz \u226a R, the case of interest,\nand so a bin that is infinitesimally thin will have nearly\nthe same cosmic variance as the adopted bins with lz = 1.5\nproper Mpc.8\nUnfortunately the ability to obtain reasonably accurate\nestimates of the mean transmissivity in infinitesimally thin\nbins is not the same as the ability to measure changes in\nthe QSO's luminosity that happened on arbitrarily short\ntime scales. Our estimate of a gas element's longitudinal separation z from the QSO will be inaccurate for two\nreasons: (1) we will not know the precise redshift of the\nQSO, and (2) our z positions are derived from redshifts\nand will be distorted from their true values by peculiar\nvelocities. As a result the time delay to the element is\nuncertain. When the time delays to different elements are\nuncertain, we cannot combine elements with exactly the\nsame delays into one bin; the various elements that make\nup a single bin will inevitably have a range of time delays. The minimum range of time delays in a bin is what\nlimits our time resolution. The remainder of the section\nconsiders this limit in more detail.\n\n13\n\nmatter overdensity at a distance r from a QSO will be\nroughly \u03b4(r) = \u03beQ (r)/b, where \u03beQ is the correlation function of QSOs. According to Croom et al. (2002), a correlation function of the form \u03beQ (r) = (r/r0 )\u2212\u03b3 , r0 \u2243 8.4h\u22121\ncomoving Mpc, \u03b3 \u2243 1.56 is appropriate for the brightest\nQSOs at any redshift. The variance of QSO number density in cells of radius rcell = 8h\u22121 comoving Mpc is there2\nfore \u03c3Q\n= 72(r0 /rcell )\u03b3 /[(3 \u2212 \u03b3)(4 \u2212 \u03b3)(6 \u2212 \u03b3)2\u03b3 ] \u2243 1.3,\n(Peebles 1980 eq. 59.3), which implies a QSO bias at\nz = 3 of b \u2243 4.5 if \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and the rms\nlinear matter-density fluctuation in r = 8h\u22121 Mpc spheres\nat z = 0 is \u03c38 = 0.9. Integrating over the correlation\nfunction shows that the mean matter overdensity within a\ncomoving radius rc , \u03b4\u0304(rc ), is roughly\n\u03b4\u0304(r) \u2243\n\n8.2. Thermal motions\nA firm lower limit to the time resolution is set by\nthe thermal motions of the 20000 K intergalactic gas.\nThe intergalactic hydrogen at a particular true z position will have an rms range of apparent z position of\n\u03c3z = (kT /mH )1/2 /H \u2243 0.04 proper Mpc for \u03a9M = 0.3,\n\u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.65. We will not be able to measure\nchanges in the QSO's luminosity that happen much more\nrapidly than the corresponding time scale t \u223c 2\u03c3z/c \u223c 0.3\nMyr. This is unlikely to be the limiting factor in the analysis.\n8.3. Streaming towards the QSO\nThe effect of larger-scale peculiar velocities is more severe. First there is the average streaming motion towards\nthe QSO, which can be crudely estimated as follows. If the\nscale dependence of QSOs' bias b is weak, then the mean\n8 The reason is that a cylinder with l \u226a R in real space will\nz\nhave lz \u226b R in Fourier space, and since the power P (k) is concentrated near k \u223c 0 the variance is dominated by contributions from\nwavenumbers k near the origin. There is little power at the distant\nends of the cylinder with large kz , and altering the limits of the kz\nintegral in equation 19 (i.e., changing the thickness lz of the cylinder\nin real space) does not affect the variance by much.\n\n(24)\n\nNow the proper radius rp of a spherically symmetric region\nwith mean interior overdensity \u03b4\u0304 evolves according to\n\u1e59p\n1\nd\u03b4\u0304\n=H\u2212\nrp\n3(1 + \u03b4\u0304) dt\n\n8.1. Uncertainty in the QSO redshift\nIf the QSO's redshift is measured from the CIV emission\nline, the uncertainty in its systemic recession velocity will\nbe \u03c3v \u2243 510km s\u22121 (Richards et al. 2002), which corresponds to a positional uncertainty of \u03c3z \u2243 1.75h\u22121\n65 proper\nMpc at z = 3 for \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7.

Radio observations of molecular emission\nlines could presumably reduce \u03c3z even further, but this is\nunlikely to benefit us much. The time resolution achievable with \u03c3z = 0.3 proper Mpc is t \u223c 2\u03c3z /c \u223c 2 Myr, and\nother effects prevent us from obtaining a resolution even\nthis coarse.\n\n3rc\u2212\u03b3\n.\n(3 \u2212 \u03b3)br0\u2212\u03b3\n\n(25)\n\nwhere H(t) is the Hubble parameter.

Random peculiar velocities\nMore troubling are random deviations around the net\nstreaming motion. As a result of them, the gas that is\nilluminated by the QSO's luminosity at time t will lie on\na complicated surface that wanders randomly around the\nparabolic time-delay surface shown in figure 3.

Peculiar velocities are\nunlikely to make material with a delay of \u223c 1 Myr appear to have a\ndelay of 3 Myr, for example, so we should be able to use the method\nto detect QSO lifetimes of order 1 Myr even though we will not be\nable to distinguish a life time of 30 Myr from one of 31 Myr.\n\n8.5. Upshot\n\n\fAdelberger\nRandom peculiar velocities are likely to be the dominant\nsource of uncertainty in a volume element's distance to the\nQSO.

It might be possible, with very high\nsignal-to-noise spectra for a very large number of background sources, to trace and correct these distortions to\nthe time delay surface. A number of interesting applications would then be possible. With current technology,\nhowever, we will have accept that the mean transmissivity\nin any bin we devise will be sensitive to the QSO's luminosity over a \u223c 10 Myr range of lookback times. Time\nresolution significantly better than this does not appear\nto be achievable.9\n9. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThis paper showed that changes over time in the luminosity of a QSO at redshift z \u223c 3 will produce ionization\ngradients in the IGM and alter the Lyman-\u03b1 forest absorption spectra of background galaxies in an observable\n< 25)\nway. Because the density of detectable galaxies (R \u223c\n\u22122\nat z \u223c 3 is high, \u223c 1 arcmin , their absorption spectra\ncan provide a detailed view of the ionization gradients. If\nan isotropically radiating QSO has an AB magnitude at\n912\u00c5 of m912 = 18, significant decreases in its luminosity\nat larger look-back times will be detectable if they happen\n< t < 50 Myr before the time of observation. The time\n1\u223c\n\u223c\nlimits expand for brighter QSOs and shrink for fainter. Increases in the QSO's luminosity over this time period will\nbe harder to detect than decreases, but since m912 = 18\ncorresponds to the steep bright end of the QSO luminosity distribution, they must be much rarer. \u00a7 7 sketches\nout the method and presents the uncertainties for a simulated QSO with known radiative history L(t); the section\nis aimed at those who want more detail but are reluctant\nto read the entire paper.\nThe method gives us sensitivity to changes in a QSO's\nluminosity over a useful range of times. Statistical arguments mentioned in the introduction show that QSOs\nmust change their luminosities significantly on time-scales\n< 100 Myr.\nIf these changes happen on time-scales\nt\u223c\n< 0.1\u20131 Myr, a handful of QSOs in large (SDSS-sized)\nt\u223c\nsamples will show major brightness changes from one\ndecade or century to the next (Martini & Schneider 2003).\nThe method I have described cannot detect luminosity\nchanges that happen on time-scales so short (\u00a7 8), but is\nsensitive changes throughout the rest of the allowed range\n< t < 100 Myr). Taken together, the two methods will\n(1 \u223c\n\u223c\nbe able to pin down the typical QSO lifetime in a robust\nand direct way.\nA number of other authors (e.g., Crotts 1989; Dobrzycki\n& Bechtold 1991; Moller & Kjaergaard 1992; Fern\u00e1ndezSoto et al. 1995; Liske & Williger 2001; Jakobsen et al.\n2003; Schirber, Miralda-Escud\u00e9, & McDonald 2004; Croft\n2004) have attempted to measure QSO lifetimes with a\nsimilar approach. Their results were ambiguous. The reason is that they used the absorption lines in a single background QSO (or, in some cases, a handful) to search for\nionization gradients around the foreground QSO. When\n9 Except at very early times, 0 > t > \u221220 Myr, when the positional uncertainties become increasingly aligned with the time-delay\ncontours; see figure 16.\n\n15\n\nthe QSO pair had a small projected separation, the analyses were confused by the high densities and large peculiar\nvelocities near the foreground QSO (see, e.g., figure 15);\nwhen the projected separation was large the foreground\nQSO's weak effect on the IGM could not stand out above\nthe cosmic variance. This paper's method sidesteps these\ndifficulties by using numerous faint galaxies rather than a\nsmall number of bright QSOs as the background sources.\nAs shown in \u00a7 5, the signal-to-noise ratio of the background\nobjects' spectra does not affect the final result by much,\nbut the number of background sources does. Choosing\ngalaxies as the background sources is therefore the sensible\napproach. With numerous background sources, the weak\neffect of a QSO on distant intergalactic matter can be detected with reasonable significance, the complicated region\nclosest to the QSO can be ignored altogether, and the peculiar velocity and density gradients at slightly larger distances can be compensated by comparing to the amount\nof Lyman-\u03b1 absorption in the large \"control region\" that\nis illuminated by light emitted by the QSO at t \u223c 0 (\u00a7 4).\nThe approach I have described should therefore be a significant improvement over previous work.\nObservers who would like to apply this approach in practice should be aware that the optimal proper size of the\nobserved region can be very different from the naive guess\nctmax with tmax the maximum time delay of interest. As\ntmax \u2192 0 intergalactic absorption at radii R \u226b ctmax becomes increasingly important for the analysis, as figures 3\nand 14 show. Two results derived in \u00a7 5 are also relevant.\nThey are discussed more fully in \u00a7 5.2, but may be summarized as follows: (A) Galaxy spectra with S:N \u223c 4 per\n7\u00c5 bin will be sufficient for measuring the QSO's radiative history with the stated precision. Obtaining better\nspectra will not improve the result by much. (B) Cosmic\nvariance places a fundamental limit on the accuracy of the\nmethod. Only a small part of the universe is bathed in\nthe light that the QSO emitted at a particular moment\nin its history, and the HI content of this region will stray\nfrom the global average for reasons that have nothing to\ndo with the luminosity of the QSO. The only detectable\nluminosity changes are those large enough to alter the intergalactic HI content by more than its intrinsic random\nfluctuations \u03c3V . A corollary is that the number of background sources does not need to be incredibly high; one\nneeds only enough to measure the mean transmissivity of\na region with a precision similar to \u03c3V , and this is easily achieved with spectra of a few dozen galaxies (but see\nbelow).\nI have neglected an important complication in the discussion so far. It is possible that the QSO's ionizing radiation will not emerge isotropically but will instead be\nfocused into a bipolar beam with opening angle \u03b1 \u223c 90o\n(Barthel 1989). If the beam were pointed towards earth\nthere would be almost no effect on the analysis (see figure 12), but in the typical case the intergalactic volume\nthat is affected by the QSO's radiation will be only \u223c 30%\nas large as I have assumed. This will increase the uncertainty in the results. Shrinking the radius of one of\nour idealized cylindrical bins (\u00a7\u00a7 5 and 7) until it contains\nonly 30% of its previous volume will increase its uncertainty due to cosmic variance, \u03c3V , by a factor of \u223c 1.5. If\ncosmic variance is still the dominant source of noise in the\n\n\f16\n\nMeasuring the Radiative Histories of QSOs\n\nsmaller bins, the error bars in the f \u0304 vs. t curve will increase\nby a similar factor. Fortunately this is not enough to prevent us from detecting changes in the QSO's luminosity for\n<\n\u221250Myr \u223c\nt (figure 11). Moreover, even with the enlarged\nerror bars it should be easy to distinguish intergalactic\nvolumes that are illuminated by the QSO's ionizing radiation from neighboring regions with transmissivities close\nto the global mean of f \u0304 \u223c 0.67, at least at small radii\nwhere the QSO's radiation is most intense (see, e.g., figure 14, which shows that the QSO's influence at small radii\nshould be detected with high significance). This statement\nis independent of the QSO's radiative history as long as it\nhas been shining for more than \u223c 10 Myr, since so large\na volume is (potentially) illuminated by light emitted at\n\u221210Myr < t < 0. If one were still worried about the possibility of beaming, QSOs could be chosen for study only if\nthey have characteristics that suggest their beam is likely\nto be pointed towards the earth (e.g., BAL QSOs or radioloud QSOs). I suspect that it will be more interesting to\nobserve many types of QSOs and use this approach as a\ndirect test of unified models of AGN.\nIn any case, the possibility of beaming makes it clear\nthat the ideal number of background sources is in fact\nseveral times larger than the arguments of point (B) suggest (see above). We would like to be cosmic-variance limited in even the possibly small fraction of the field that is\nstruck by the QSO's ionizing radiation. Several hundred\nbackground sources would be ideal. Fortunately multiobject spectrographs with the required large field-of-view\n(e.g., IMACS; Dressler et al. 2003) can obtain this many\nspectra with a small number of slitmasks. Achieving the\nnecessary signal-to-noise ratio for the background galax>\n3 is less daunting than it sounds, since the large\nies at z \u223c\nfield-of-view allows one to pick sources from the bright end\nof the luminosity distribution.\nI should mention in closing that the results of this paper could be extended or improved in a number of ways.\nThe expected cosmic variance \u03c3V played a large role in\nthe analysis, yet was estimated from an imperfect model\nof the three-dimensional transmissivity power-spectrum.\nBetter numbers should be derived from numerical simulations. It would be interesting to know if measuring the\nradiation intensity with something other than the mean\ntransmissivity f \u0304 would let us achieve tighter constraints\non the QSO's radiative history before we were limited by\ncosmic variance. I assumed that the QSO would have redshift z = 3.0, but in fact observers could choose to observe\n< z < 4 where the Lyman-\u03b1 forQSOs at any redshift 2 \u223c\n\u223c\nest is visible from the ground and reasonable numbers of\nbackground galaxies can be identified. Finding the QSO\nredshift that minimizes the required observing time would\nallow one to study a larger number of targets. This work\nis admittedly unfinished. I hope to have shown that it is\nworth pursuing further.\nGeorge Becker and Luis Ho were a useful sources of\ninformation about AGN and the uncertainty in different\nQSO-redshift estimators. Esther Hu helped me find electronic version of her Voigt-profile line lists. Chuck Steidel\nfielded my random questions like a pro. Alice Shapley's\nemail responses to my questions were always prompt and\nenlightening, and in addition she graciously allowed me to\n\nshow the data in Figure 8. Rob Simcoe had helpful advice\non several subjects. Paul Martini offered useful comments\non an earlier draft. Andrew Carnegie's generosity put the\nfood on my table. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the hospitality of Las Campanas Observatory during a long stay\nin Dec 2003 when this paper was begun.\n\nREFERENCES\nAbel, T. & Haehnelt, M.G. 1999, ApJ, 520, L13\nAdelberger, K.L., Steidel, C.C., Shapley, A.E., & Pettini, M. 2003,\nApJ, 584, 45\nAdams, F.C., Graff, D.S., & Richstone, D.O. 2001, ApJ, 551, L31\nBajtlik, S., Duncan, R.C., & Ostriker, J.P 1988, ApJ, 327, 570\nBardeen, J.M., Bond, J.R., Kaiser, N., & Szalay, A.S. 1986, ApJ,\n304, 15\nBarthel, P.D. 1989, ApJ, 336, 606\nBurkert, A. & Silk, J. 2001, ApJ, 554, L151\nCavaliere, A. & Vittorini, V. 2000, ApJ, 543, 599\nCen, R. 1992, ApJS, 78, 341\nCroft, R.A.C. 2004, ApJ, submitted\nCroom, S.M., Boyle, B.J., Loaring, N.S., Miller, L., Outram, P.J.,\nShanks, T., & Smith, R.J. 2002, MNRAS, 335, 459\nCrotts, A.P.S. 1989, ApJ, 336, 550\nDi Matteo, T., Croft, R.A.C., Springel, V., & Hernquist, L. 2003,\nApJ, 593, 56\nDobrzycki, A. & Bechtold, J. 1991, ApJ, 377, L69\nDressler, A.M., Sutin, B.M., & Bigelow, B.C. 2003, SPIE, 4834, 255\nFern\u00e1ndez-Soto, A., Barcons, X., Carballo, R., & Webb, J.K. 1995,\nMNRAS, 277, 235\nG\u00f3rski, K. 1988, ApJ, 332, L7\nGunn, J.E. & Peterson, B.A. 1965, ApJ, 142, 1633\nHaehnelt, M.G. & Kauffmann, G. 2000, MNRAS, 318, L35\nHaehnelt, M.G., Natarajan, P., Rees, M.J. 1998, MNRAS, 300, 817\nHosokawa, T. 2002, ApJ, 576, 75\nHu, E.M., Kim, T.-S., Cowie, L.L., Songaila, A., & Rauch, M. 1995,\nAJ, 110, 1526\nHui, L., Burles, S., Seljak, U., Rutledge, R.E., Magnier, E., & Tytler,\nD., 2001, ApJ, 552, 15\nJakobsen, P., Jansen, R.A., Wagner, S., & Reimers, D. 2003, A&A,\n397, 891\nKirkman, D. & Tytler, D. 1997, ApJ, 484, 672\nLiske, J. & Williger, G.M. 2001, MNRAS, 328, 653\nMadau, P., Haardt, F., & Rees, M.J. 1999, ApJ, 514, 648\nMartini, P. 2003, in \"Carnegie Observatories Astrophysics Series, Vol\nI\", ed.
