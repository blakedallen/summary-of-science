We study the behavior of generic initial ideals with respect to fibre products.\nIn our main result we determine the generic initial ideal of the fibre product with respect\nto the reverse lexicographic order. As an application we compute the symmetric algebraic shifted complex of two disjoint simplicial complexes as was conjectured by Kalai.\nThis result is the symmetric analogue of a theorem of Nevo who determined the exterior\nalgebraic shifted complex of two disjoint simplicial complexes as predicted by Kalai.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nLet K be a field of characteristic 0, S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] and I be a graded ideal of S. Unless\notherwise said, initial terms are taken with respect to the degree reverse lexicographic\norder, rlex for short. The generic initial ideal gin(I) of I is an important object. It reflects\nmany homological, geometrical and combinatorial properties of the associated rings and\nvarieties. The ideal gin(I) is defined as the ideal of initial terms of \u03c6 (I) where \u03c6 is a\ngeneric element of GLn (K). Here GLn (K) acts on S as the group of graded K-algebra\nisomorphisms. See, e.g., Eisenbud [6] for the construction, in particular for the precise\ndefinition of \"generic\" element, and [7, 8] for results related to the generic initial ideal.\nIn practice, to compute gin(I), one takes a random element \u03c6 \u2208 GLn (K) and computes,\nwith CoCoA [1], Macaulay 2 [12] or Singular [14], the ideal of leading terms of \u03c6 (I). The\nresulting ideal is, with very high probability, gin(I). From the theoretical point of view\nit is in general difficult to describe gin(I) explicitly. Just to give an example, important\nconjectures, such as the Fr\u00f6berg conjecture on Hilbert functions, would be solved if we\ncould only say what is the gin of a generic complete intersection.\nGeneric initial ideals can also be defined in the exterior algebra. In the exterior algebra\ncontext Kalai made in [11] conjectures about the behavior of generic initial ideals of\nsquarefree monomial ideals with respect standard operations on simplicial complexes.\nTwo of these operations have purely algebraic counterparts: they corresponds to the tensor\nproduct and the fibre product over K of standard graded K-algebras. If A = \u2295Ai and\nB = \u2295Bi are standard graded K-algebras the tensor product A \u2297K B = \u2295(Ai \u2297K B j ) is a\n(bi)graded K-algebra and the fibre product A \u25e6 B is, by definition, A \u2297K B/(A1 \u2297 B1 ). Note\nthat we have the short exact sequence\n(1)\n\n0 \u2192 A \u25e6 B \u2192 A \u2295 B \u2192 K \u2192 0.\n\nIf we have presentations A = K[x1 , . . ., xn ]/I and B = K[xn+1 , . . ., xn+m ]/J then A \u2297K B\nhas presentation K[x1 , . . . , xn+m ]/I + J and A \u25e6 B has presentation K[x1 , . . ., xn+m ]/F(I, J)\nwhere\nF(I, J) = I + J + Q\nBoth authors thank CRUI and DAAD for the financial support given through the Vigoni project.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nALDO CONCA AND TIM R\u00d6MER\n\nand Q = (xi : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n)(x j : n + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m).\nDenote by ginn (I) the gin of I in K[x1 , . . . , xn ] with respect to rlex induced by x1 >\n* * * > xn . Similarly denote by ginm (J) the gin of J in K[xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ] with respect to\nrlex induced by xn+1 > * * * > xn+m . Kalai's conjectures [11] correspond, in the symmetric\nalgebra, to the following statements:\n(2)\n\ngin(I + J) = gin(ginn (I) + ginm (J)),\n\n(3)\n\ngin(F(I, J)) = gin(F(ginn (I), ginm (J)).\n\nAs observed by Nevo [13], the exterior algebra counterpart of Equality (2) does not\nhold. Hence it is not surprising to discover that (2) does not hold in the symmetric algebra\nas well. Here is a simple example:\nExample 1.1. Set n = 2, m = 3 and I = (x1 , x2 )2 and J = (x23 , x3 x4 , x4 x5 ). Then gin2 (I) = I\nsince I is strongly stable, gin3 (J) = (x3 , x4 )2 since J defines a Cohen-Macaulay ring of\ncodimension 2. But gin(I + J) and gin(ginn (I) + ginm (J)) differ already in degree 2 since\nx1 x4 belongs to the second, but not to the first ideal.\nOn the other hand, Nevo [13] proved the exterior algebra analog of (3) for squarefree\nmonomial ideals. Our main result asserts that (3) holds:\nTheorem 1.2. Let I \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] and J \u2282 K[xn+1 , . . ., xn+m ] be graded ideals. Then we\nhave gin(F(I, J)) = gin(F(ginn (I), ginm (J))).\nUsing the results in Section 3 it is also possible to compute explicitly gin(F(I, J)) in\nsome cases. As an example we show that\ngin(Q) = (xi x j : i + j \u2264 n + m, i \u2264 j and i \u2264 min{n, m})\nand further that gin(Qk ) = gin(Q)k for all k \u2208 N. In Section 4 we present an application related to simplicial complexes. Let \u0393 be a simplicial complex on the vertex set {x1 , . . ., xn }.\nWe denote the symmetric algebraic shifted complex of \u0393 by \u2206s (\u0393). In general a shifting\noperation \u2206 in the sense of Kalai [11] replaces a complex \u0393 with a combinatorially simpler\ncomplex \u2206(\u0393) that still detects some combinatorial properties of \u0393. Symmetric algebraic\nshifting \u2206s is an example of such an operation and can be realized by using a kind of\npolarization of the generic initial ideal with respect to the reverse lexicographic order of\nthe Stanley-Reisner ideal of \u0393 in the polynomial ring K[x1 , . . . , xn ]. See Section 4 for\nprecise definitions and more details. For two simplicial complexes \u03931 on the vertex set\n{x1 , . . ., xn } and \u03932 on the vertex set {xn+1 , . . . , xn+m } we denote by \u03931 \u228e \u03932 the disjoint\nunion of \u03931 and \u03932 on the vertex set {x1 , . . ., xn , xn+1 , . . ., xn+m }. In Section 4 we prove:\nTheorem 1.3. We have \u2206s (\u03931 \u228e \u03932 ) = \u2206s (\u2206s (\u03931 ) \u228e \u2206s (\u03932 )).\nThis result was conjectured by Kalai in [11] and it was proved for exterior shifting\nby Nevo [13] who noted also that his approach could be used to prove the statement for\nsymmetric shifting. Indeed, our methods and strategy of proofs as presented in Section\n2 and Section 3 follow the ideas of Nevo and can be seen as a symmetric version of his\nresults in the exterior algebra.\n\n\fGENERIC INITIAL IDEALS AND FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\n2. L INEAR A LGEBRA\n\nAND\n\nG ENERIC\n\n3\n\nINITIAL IDEALS\n\nIn this section we present some tools from linear algebra used in this paper. We follow\nideas of Nevo [13] who treated the exterior case of the results which will be presented in\nthis section.\nLet K be a field with char K = 0 and S = K[x1 , . . ., xn ] be the standard graded polynomial\nring. Given a monomial xa \u2208 Sd we define a K-linear map \u03c4xa : S \u2192 S by\n(\nxb\u2212a if a \u0016 b,\nb\n\u03c4xa (x ) =\n0\nelse.\nFor a polynomial g = \u2211a\u2208Nn \u03bba xa \u2208 S we extend this definition and consider the K-linear\nmap \u03c4g = \u2211a\u2208Nn \u03bba \u03c4xa . In the following we will use the rule\n\n\u03c4gh (l) = \u03c4g (\u03c4h (l)) for homogeneous g, h, l \u2208 S\nwhich is easily verified.\nGiven a graded ideal I \u2282 S and the reverse lexicographic order <rlex induced by x1 >\n* * * > xn on S, the algebra S/I has a K-basis B(S/I) consisting of those monomial xa such\nthat xa 6\u2208 in(I) where in(I) always denotes the initial ideal of I with respect to rlex.\nInduced by the inclusion of B(S/I) into B(S), we may consider S/I as a graded Kvector subspace of S. (So we are not using the quotient structure of S/I as an S-module in\nthe following if not otherwise stated.) Given a homogeneous element g \u2208 Sd the map \u03c4g\ncan be restricted to S/I. The main object we are studying are the various kernels\nKerS/I (\u03c4g )e = Ker(\u03c4g : (S/I)e \u2192 (S/I)e\u2212d ).\nWe fix now a second generic K-basis f j = \u2211nj=1 ai j xi of S1 where A = (ai j ) \u2208 K n\u00d7n is\ninvertible and study the map \u03c4 f a where f a is a monomial in the new K-basis f1 , . . ., fn .\nGeneric means here that with the automorphism \u03c6 : S \u2192 S, xi 7\u2192 fi we can compute the\ngeneric initial ideal gin(I) with respect to rlex induced by x1 > * * * > xn of a given graded\nideal I \u2282 S via gin(I) = in(\u03c6 \u22121 (I)).\nWe need the following alternative way to decide whether a monomial belongs to a\ngeneric initial ideal or not. This criterion is well-known to specialists but we include it for\nthe sake of completeness. For a (homogeneous) element g \u2208 S we denote by g the residue\nclass in S/I (induced by the quotient structure of S/I).\nLemma 2.1. Let I \u2282 S be a graded ideal and xa \u2208 S be a monomial. Then\nxa \u2208 gin(I) \u21d0\u21d2 f a \u2208 spanK { f b : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 S/I.\nProof. We have that\nxa \u2208 gin(I) = in(\u03c6 \u22121 (I))\n\u21d4 xa \u2212\n\n\u2211\n\n\u03bbb xb \u2208 \u03c6 \u22121 (I) for some \u03bbb \u2208 K\n\nxb <rlex xa , |b|=|a|\n\n\u21d4 xa \u2208 spanK {xb : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 S/\u03c6 \u22121 (I)\n\u21d4 f a \u2208 spanK { f b : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 S/I.\nThis concludes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nALDO CONCA AND TIM R\u00d6MER\n\nLet B(S/I) = {xc : xc 6\u2208 in(I)} be the K-basis of S/I as discussed above. Similarly\nB(S/ gin(I)) is the natural K-basis of S/ gin(I), i. e. those monomials xc with xc 6\u2208 gin(I).\nWe consider these monomials either as monomials in S or in the corresponding residue\nclass ring of S. The generic initial ideal gin(I) can also be characterized via the kernels\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f a )e . More precisely, we have:\nProposition 2.2. Let d > 0 be a positive integer, xa \u2208 Sd be a monomial and I \u2282 S be a\ngraded ideal. Then\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f b )d = |{xc \u2208 B(S/ gin(I)) : |c| = d, xa \u2264rlex xc }|.\n\n\\\n\ndimK\n\nxb <rlex xa , |b|=d\n\nIn particular, xa \u2208 B(S/ gin(I)) if and only if\n\\\n\ndimK\n\nxb <rlex xa ,\n\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f b )d > dimK\n\n\\\n\nxb \u2264rlex xa ,\n\n|b|=d\n\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f b )d .\n|b|=d\n\nProof. Let g \u2208 (S/I)d be a homogenous element expressed as a linear combination of the\nelements of B(S/I), i. e.\n\n\u2211\n\ng=\n\n\u03bbc xc for some \u03bbc \u2208 K.\n\nxc \u2208B(S/I)\n\nWrite f b for b \u2208 Nn with |b| = d as\n\n\u2211\u2032\nn\n\nfb =\n\n\u2032\n\nAba\u2032 xa\n\na\u2032 \u2208N , |a |=d\n\nwhere Aba\u2032 is a polynomial in the ai j of the base change matrix A = (ai j ). We get that\n\n\u03c4 f b (g) =\n\n\u2211\n\nAbc \u03bbc .\n\nxc \u2208B(S/I)\n\nHence\ndimK\n\n\\\n\nxb <rlex xa ,\n\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f b )d\n|b|=d\n\nequals the dimension of the solution space S of the linear systems of equations Ma z = 0\nwith the matrix Ma = (Abc ) where xb <rlex xa , xc \u2208 B(S/I) and |b| = |c| = d. It follows\nfrom Lemma 2.1 that\nrank Ma = |{xc \u2208 B(S/ gin(I)) : |c| = d, xc <rlex xa }|.\nWe compute\ndimK\n\n\\\n\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f b )d = dimK Ker(Ma : (S/I)d \u2192 (S/I)d )\n\nxb <rlex xa , |b|=d\n\n= dimK (S/I)d \u2212 rank Ma\n= dimK (S/ gin(I))d \u2212 rank Ma\n= {xc \u2208 B(S/ gin(I)) : |c| = d, xa \u2264rlex xc }\nand this is what we wanted.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fGENERIC INITIAL IDEALS AND FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\n5\n\nFor later applications we give a second characterization of the membership in the\ngeneric initial ideals which is similar to Proposition 2.2. At first we need the following\nLemma:\nLemma 2.3. Let a \u2208 Nn and d = |a| < e. Then\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f a )e =\n\nn\n\\\n\nKerS/I (\u03c4 f a+\u03b5 j )e\n\nj=1\n\nProof. Let g \u2208 KerS/I (\u03c4 f a )e . Then for i = 1, . . ., n we have that \u03c4 f a+\u03b5 j (g) = \u03c4 f j (\u03c4 f a (g)) =\n0.

If xa 6\u2208\n\u2032\ngin(I), then xb 6\u2208 gin(I) for xb = x j xa and min(a) \u2264 j \u2264 min(a\u2032 ) because gin(I) is strongly\nstable. Hence min(xa /xmin(a) ) \u2212 min(xa ) + 1 \u2264 dI (a) because the considered monomials\n\u2032\nxb are elements of Sh(xa ). Similarly we see that min(xa /xmin(a) ) \u2212 min(xa ) + 1 \u2264 dI (a)\nimplies that xa 6\u2208 gin(I).\n\u0003\nSince gin(gin(I)) = gin(I) (see, e.g., [2] for a proof) it follows right from the definition\nthat:\nLemma 2.6.

Let ginn (I) be the generic initial ideal of a graded ideal I \u2282\nK[x1 , . . . , xn ] with respect to rlex induced by x1 > * * * > xn , let ginm (J) be the generic initial\nideal of a graded ideal J \u2282 K[xn+1 , . . ., xn+m ] with respect to rlex induced by xn+1 > * * * >\nxn+m , and let gin(L) be the generic initial ideal of a graded ideal L \u2282 S = K[x1 , . . ., xn+m ]\nwith respect to rlex induced by x1 > * * * > xn > xn+1 > * * * > xn+m . Furthermore we define\nthe ideals mn = (x1 , . . ., xn ) \u2282 K[x1 , . . ., xn ], mm = (xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ) \u2282 K[xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ])\nand Q = mn mm \u2282 S. We prove first a special version of our main result:\nProposition 3.1. Let I \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] and J \u2282 K[xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ] be graded ideals. Then\nwe have the following formulas for ideals in S:\n(i) gin(I + mm ) = gin(ginn (I) + mm ).\n(ii) gin(J + mn ) = gin(ginm (J) + mn ).\n\n\fGENERIC INITIAL IDEALS AND FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\n7\n\nProof. (i): Let f1 , . . . , fn+m \u2282 S1 be a K-basis such that for the S-automorphism \u03c6 : S \u2192\nS, xi 7\u2192 fi we can compute gin(I + mm ) and gin(ginn (I) + mm ) by using \u03c6 \u22121 . We denote\nthe residue class of fi in K[x1 , . . . , xn ] = S/mm by gi .\nLet \u03c8 : K[x1 , . . . , xn ] \u2192 K[x1 , . . ., xn ] be an K[x1 , . . . , xn ]-automorphism such that the\nideals ginn (I) and ginn (ginn (I)) can be computed by using \u03c8 \u22121 .\nFor a monomial xa \u2208 S we have that\nxa \u2208 gin(I + mm )\n\u21d4 f a \u2208 spanK { f b : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 S/(I + mm )\n\u21d4 ga \u2208 spanK {gb : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . ., xn ]/I\n\u21d4 \u03c8 \u22121 (ga ) \u2208 spanK {\u03c8 \u22121 (gb ) : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . ., xn ]/\u03c8 \u22121 (I)\n\u21d4 \u03c8 \u22121 (ga ) \u2208 spanK {\u03c8 \u22121 (gb ) : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . ., xn ]/ ginn (I).\nHere the first equality follows from Lemma 2.1. The second one is trivial. The third one\nfollows since \u03c8 \u22121 is an K-automorphism and the last equality follows since S/\u03c8 \u22121 (I)\nand K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/ ginn (I) = K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/ in<rlex (\u03c8 \u22121 (I)) share a common K-vector space\nbasis. Similarly we compute\nxa \u2208 gin(ginn (I) + mm )\n\u21d4 f a \u2208 spanK { f b : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 S/(ginn (I) + mm )\n\u21d4 ga \u2208 spanK {gb : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/ ginn (I)\n\u21d4 \u03c8 \u22121 (ga ) \u2208 spanK {\u03c8 \u22121 (gb ) : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/\u03c8 \u22121 (ginn (I))\n\u21d4 \u03c8 \u22121 (ga ) \u2208 spanK {\u03c8 \u22121 (gb ) : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/ ginn (ginn (I))\n\u21d4 \u03c8 \u22121 (ga ) \u2208 spanK {\u03c8 \u22121 (gb ) : xb <rlex xa , |b| = |a|} \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/ ginn (I).\nThe last equality is new and it follows from the fact that ginn (ginn (I)) = ginn (I). Thus\nwe see that\ngin(I + mm ) = gin(ginn (I) + mm )\nand this shows (i). Analogously one proves (ii).\n\n\u0003\n\nWe need the following result which relates the numbers dI (a) introduced in Section 2\nof various ideals.\nProposition 3.2. Let I \u2282 K[x1 , . . ., xn ] and J \u2282 K[xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ] be graded ideals and\nxa \u2208 Sd be a monomial with d > 1. We have that\ndI+J+Q (a) = dI+mm (a) + dJ+mn (a).\nProof. As a K-vector space we may see S/(I +mm ) and S/(J +mn ) as subspaces of S/(I +\nJ + Q) using the standard K-bases B(S/(I + mm )), B(S/(J + mn )) and B(S/(I + J + Q))\nrespectively. Using the equality (I + mm ) \u2229 (J + mn ) = I + J + Q it follows from a direct\ncomputation that the homomorphism of K-vector spaces\n\n\u03c1d : S/(I + mm )d \u2295 S/(J + mn )d \u2192 S/(I + J + Q)d , (g, h) 7\u2192 g + h,\nis surjective with trivial kernel for d > 0.

Let xa \u2208 Sd be a monomial for an integer d > 0. If d = 1 then gin(I + J +\nQ)1 = gin(ginn (I) + ginm (J) + Q)1 for trivial reasons. Assume that d > 1. Applying\nLemma 2.6, Proposition 3.1 and Proposition 3.2 we see that\ndI+J+Q (a) = dI+mm (a) + dJ+mn (a) = dgin(I+mm ) (a) + dgin(J+mn ) (a)\n= dgin(ginn (I)+mm ) (a) + dgin(ginm (J)+mn ) (a) = dginn (I)+mm (a) + dginm (J)+mn (a)\n= dginn (I)+ginm (J)+Q (a).\nThus it follows from Lemma 2.5 that\nxa 6\u2208 gin(I + J + Q) \u21d4 xa 6\u2208 gin(ginn (I) + ginm (J) + Q).\n\u0003\nRemark 3.3. It is clear that rlex plays an important role in the arguments we have used\nto prove 1.2. For other term orders the statement of 1.2 fails to be true. For instance, for\nthe lex order, m = n = 3 the ideals I = (x21 , x1 x2 ) and J = (x24 , x5 x6 ) do not fulfill 1.2.\n\n\fGENERIC INITIAL IDEALS AND FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\n9\n\nIn view of Theorem 1.2, the ideal gin(F(I, J)) can be computed by first computing\nginn (I), ginm (J) and then gin(F(ginn (I), ginm (J))). One would like to describe the generators of the ideal gin(F(I, J)) in terms of those of ginn (I) and ginm (J). The first step in\nthis direction is the following:\nProposition 3.4. Let Q = (xi : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n)(x j : n + 1 \u2264 j \u2264 m) \u2282 S. Then:\n(i) gin(Q) = (xi x j : i + j \u2264 n + m, i \u2264 j and i \u2264 min{n, m}).\n(ii) gin(Qk ) = gin(Q)k for all k.\nProof. Every ideal which is a product of ideals of linear forms has a linear resolution,\nsee [4]. The gin-rlex of an ideal with linear resolution has linear resolution [6]. Hence\nwe know that gin(Qk ) is generated in degree 2k for all k. Therefore it is enough to prove\nequality (i) in degree 2 and to prove equality (ii) in degree 2k. To check that (i) holds in\ndegree 2, it is enough to prove the inclusion \u2287 since the two vector spaces involved have\nvector space dimension equal to mn. It follows from Lemma 2.5 that for a monomial xi x j\nwith i \u2264 j we have\nxi x j \u2208 gin(Q) \u21d0\u21d2 j \u2212 i + 1 > dQ (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j )\nwhere for k \u2208 {1, . . ., n + m} we denote by \u03b5k the k-th standard basis vector of Zn+m . By\nLemma 2.6 and Proposition 3.2 we know\n(4) dQ (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) = dmm (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) + dmn (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) = dgin(mm ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) + dgin(mn ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j )\n(5)\n\n= d(x1 ,...,xm ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) + d(x1 ,...,xn ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j )\n\nwhere we used the obvious facts gin(mm ) = (x1 , . . ., xm ) and gin(mn ) = (x1 , . . . , xn ).\nThus we have to compute d(x1 ,...,xm ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) and d(x1 ,...,xn ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) respectively. We treat\nthe case n \u2264 m; if n > m one argues analogously. At first we consider\n1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n + m with i + j \u2264 n + m, i \u2264 j and i \u2264 n.\nIt follows from the definition that\nd(x1 ,...,xm ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) = |{xl x j : m + 1 \u2264 l, j \u2264 m + n, l \u2264 j}|.\nThis number is only nonzero if j \u2265 m + 1 and in this case we have d(x1 ,...,xm ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) =\nj \u2212 m. Similarly, we have that d(x1 ,...,xn ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) is only nonzero if j \u2265 n + 1 and in this\ncase we have d(x1 ,...,xn ) (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) = j \u2212 n. In any case it follow from Equation (4) that\ndQ (\u03b5i + \u03b5 j ) \u2264 ( j \u2212 n) + ( j \u2212 m) \u2264 (m \u2212 i) + ( j \u2212 m) < j \u2212 i + 1\nwhere we used that i+ j \u2264 m+n. Hence we get that xi x j \u2208 gin(Q) as desired. As explained\nabove, this proves (i).\nAs observed above, to prove (ii) it is enough to prove the asserted equality in degree 2k.\nConsider the K-algebra K[\u03c6 (Q2 )] generated by \u03c6 (Q2 ) for a generic change of coordinates\n\u03c6 . The assertion we have to prove is equivalent to the assertion that the initial algebra of\nK[\u03c6 (Q2 )] is generated as a K-algebra by the elements xi x j described in (i) which generate\ngin(Q) as an ideal. We claim that the algebra relations among those xi x j are of degree 2.\nThis can be easily seen by eliminating from the second Veronese ring of S using the know\nGr\u00f6bner bases [3] or [15]. Hence, by the Buchberger-like criterion for being a Sagbi\nbasis [5], it suffices to prove that gin(Q2 ) = gin(Q)2 in degree 4. This can be done by\n\n\f10\n\nALDO CONCA AND TIM R\u00d6MER\n\nchecking that the two vector spaces involved\u0001have \u0001the same dimension. The dimension of\nm+1\ngin(Q2 )4 is equal to that of Q24 which is n+1\n2\n2 . It remains to compute the dimension\n2\n2\nof gin(Q)4 .

We do not know other families of ideals satisfying it. It is difficult to guess a generalization of it. For instance that equality does not hold for a product of 3 or more ideals of linear forms,\ne.g. (x1 , x2 )(x3 , x4 )(x5 , x6 ). And it does not hold for the ideal defining the fibre\nproduct of 3 of more polynomial rings, e.g. (x1 , x2 )(x3 , x4 ) + (x1 , x2 )(x5 , x6 ) +\n(x3 , x4 )(x5 , x6 ).\n(c) The statements (i) and (ii) of 3.4, can be rephrased as follows: The (n, m)-th\nSegre product in generic coordinates has a toric degeneration to a ladder of the\nsecond Veronese ring of the polynomial ring in m + n \u2212 1 variables and this holds\nindependently of the term order.\n\n\fGENERIC INITIAL IDEALS AND FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\n4.

Let fi be the total number of i-dimensional faces of \u0393\nfor i = \u22121, . . ., dim \u0393. The vector f (\u0393) = ( f\u22121 , . . . , fdim \u0393 ) is called the f -vector of \u0393.\nLet C (x1 , . . . , xn ) be the set of simplicial complexes on {x1 , . . ., xn }. Following constructions of Kalai we define axiomatically the concept of algebraic shifting. See [8]\nand [11] for surveys on this subject. We call a map \u2206 : C (x1 , . . . , xn ) \u2192 C (x1 , . . ., xn ) an\nalgebraic shifting operation if the following is satisfied:\n(S1) If \u0393 \u2208 C (x1 , . . . , xn ), then \u2206(\u0393) is a shifted complex, i. e. for all F \u2208 \u2206(\u0393) and\ni < j with xi \u2208 F we have that F \\ {xi } \u222a {x j } \u2208 \u2206(\u0393).\n(S2) If \u0393 \u2208 C (x1 , . . . , xn ) is shifted, then \u2206(\u0393) = \u0393.\n(S3) If \u0393 \u2208 C (x1 , . . . , xn ), then f (\u0393) = f (\u2206(\u0393)).\n(S4) If \u0393\u2032 , \u0393 \u2208 C (x1 , . . . , xn ) and \u0393\u2032 \u2286 \u0393 is a subcomplex, then \u2206(\u0393\u2032 ) \u2286 \u2206(\u0393) is a subcomplex.\nLet K be a field and S = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] be the polynomial ring in n indeterminates. We\ndefine the Stanley-Reisner ideal I\u0393 = (\u220fxi \u2208F xi : F \u2286 {x1 , . . . , xn }, F 6\u2208 \u0393) and the StanleyReisner ring K[\u0393] = S/I\u0393 . Denote by xF the squarefree monomial \u220fxi \u2208F xi .\nNote that a simplicial complex \u0393 is shifted if and only if the Stanley-Reisner ideal I\u0393 \u2282\nS = K[x1 , . . . , xn ] is a squarefree strongly stable ideal with respect to x1 > * * * > xn , i. e. for\nall F \u2286 {x1 , . . . , xn } with xF \u2208 I\u0393 and all xi \u2208 F, j < i, x j 6\u2208 F we have that (x j xF )/xi \u2208 I\u0393 .\nHere we are interested in the following shifting operation introduced by Kalai. We\nfollow the algebraic approach of Aramova, Herzog and Hibi. Assume that K is a field\nof characteristic 0. We consider the following operation on monomial ideals of S. For a\nmonomial m = xi1 * * * xit with i1 \u2264 i2 * * * \u2264 it of S we set m\u03c3 = xi1 xi2 +1 . . . xit +t\u22121 . For a\nmonomial ideal I with unique minimal system of generators G(I) = {m1 , . . . , ms } we set\nI \u03c3 = (m\u03c31 , . . . , m\u03c3s ) in a suitable polynomial ring with sufficiently many variables.\nLet \u0393 be a simplicial complex on the vertex set {x1 , . . ., xn } with Stanley-Reisner ideal\nI\u0393 . The symmetric algebraic shifted complex of \u0393 is the unique simplicial complex \u2206s (\u0393)\non the vertex set {x1 , . . . , xn } such that I\u2206s (\u0393) = gin(I\u0393 )\u03c3 \u2282 S where gin(*) is the generic\ninitial ideal with respect to the reverse lexicographic order induced by x1 > * * * > xn . It\nis not obvious that \u2206s (*) is indeed a shifting operation. The first difficulty is already that\nI\u2206s (\u0393) is an ideal of S. This and the proofs of the other properties can be found in [8].\nWe want to give a combinatorial application of the results of Section 3. For two simplicial complexes \u03931 on the vertex set {x1 , . . ., xn } and \u03932 on the vertex set {xn+1 , . . ., xn+m }\nwe denote by\n\u03931 \u228e \u03932\nthe disjoint union of \u03931 and \u03932 on the vertex set {x1 , . . . , xn , xn+1 , . . . , xn+m }. The following theorem was conjectured by Kalai in [11]. Observe that it was proved for exterior\nshifting by Nevo [13].\n\n\f12\n\nALDO CONCA AND TIM R\u00d6MER\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let \u03931 be a simplicial complex on the vertex set {x1 , . . . , xn } and \u03932 be a\nsimplicial complex on the vertex set {xn+1 , . . . , xn+m }. Then we have that\n\u2206s (\u03931 \u228e \u03932 ) = \u2206s (\u2206s(\u03931 ) \u228e \u2206s(\u03932 )).\nProof. The Stanley-Reisner ideal of \u03931 \u228e \u03932 is I\u03931 \u228e\u03932 = I\u03931 + I\u03932 + Q. To determine the\nsimplicial complex \u2206s (\u03931 \u228e \u03932 ) we compute\nI\u2206s (\u03931 \u228e\u03932 ) = gin(I\u03931 + I\u03932 + Q)\u03c3\n\n= gin(ginn (I\u03931 ) + ginm (I\u03932 ) + Q)\u03c3\n= gin(ginn (ginn (I\u03931 )\u03c3n ) + ginm (ginm (I\u03932 )\u03c3m ) + Q)\u03c3\n= gin(ginn (I\u03931 )\u03c3n + ginm (I\u03932 )\u03c3m + Q)\u03c3 = I\u2206s (\u2206s (\u03931 )\u228e\u2206s (\u03932 )) .\n\nThe first and fifth equality are the definitions of the corresponding ideals. The second and\nforth equality follow from 1.2. The third equality follows from the proof in [8, Theorem\n8.19].\n\u0003\n5. A LGEBRAIC\n\nPROPERTIES OF FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\nIt is easy to see how homological properties transfer from A and B to A \u25e6 B. The main\npoint is that the short exact Sequence (1) allows to compare how to control local cohomology. In this section we show that the componentwise linearity behaves well with respect\nto fibre products. Recall the following definition of Herzog-Hibi [9]. A graded ideal L in\nsome polynomial ring over the field K is called componentwise linear if for all k \u2208 N the\nideal Lhki has a k-linear resolution (i.e. Tori (Lhki , K)i+ j = 0 for j 6= k) where Lhki is the\nideal generated by all elements of degree k of L.\nIn the proof we will use the following criterion of Herzog-Reiner-Welker [10, Theorem\n17] to check whether an ideal is componentwise linear: Let L be a graded ideal in a\npolynomial ring T . Then L is componentwise linear if and only if for all k \u2208 Z we have\nreg T /L\u2264k \u2264 k \u2212 1 where L\u2264k is the ideal generated by all elements of L of degree smaller\nor equal to k and reg M denotes the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a f.g. graded T module M. Note that in [10] this result is only stated for monomial ideals, but the proof\nworks also, more generally, for graded ideals. Recall that the Castelnuovo-Mumford\nregularity can be computed via local cohomology as reg M = max{ j \u2208 Z : Hmi (M) j\u2212i 6=\n0 for some i} where m denotes also the graded maximal ideal of T .\nTheorem 5.1. Let I \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xn ] and J \u2282 K[xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ] be graded ideals such that\nI \u2286 m2n and J \u2286 m2m . Then I and J are componentwise linear if and only if F(I, J) is\ncomponentwise linear.\nProof. At first we note that F(I, J)\u2264k = 0 for k \u2264 1, and for k \u2265 2 we have\nF(I, J)\u2264k = (I + J + Q)\u2264k = I\u2264k + J\u2264k + Q = N(I\u2264k , J\u2264k ).\nThe short exact Sequence (1) with the current notation is:\n0 \u2192 S/F(I, J)\u2264k \u2192 S/(I\u2264k + mm ) \u2295 S/(J\u2264k + mn ) \u2192 S/m \u2192 0.\nIt induces the long exact sequence of local cohomology modules in degree j \u2212 i\n* * * \u2192 Hmi\u22121 (S/m) j\u22121\u2212(i\u22121) \u2192 Hmi (S/F(I, J)\u2264k) j\u2212i\n\n\fGENERIC INITIAL IDEALS AND FIBRE PRODUCTS\n\n13\n\n\u2192 Hmi (S/(I\u2264k + mm )) j\u2212i \u2295 Hmi (S/(J\u2264k + mn )) j\u2212i \u2192 Hmi (S/m) j\u2212i \u2192 . . .\nObserve that for j \u2265 2 we have that Hmi\u22121 (S/m) j\u22121\u2212(i\u22121) = Hmi (S/m) j\u2212i = 0 because S/m\nhas regularity 0. The ring change isomorphism for local cohomology modules yields\nH i (S/(I\u2264k + mm )) \u223c\n= H i (K[x1 , . . ., xn ]/I\u2264k )\nm\n\nmn\n\nand\n\nHmi (S/(J\u2264k + mn )) \u223c\n= Hmi m (K[xn+1 , . . ., xn+m ]/J\u2264k )\nas graded K-vector spaces. Thus we get for j \u2265 2 the isomorphisms\nH i (S/F(I, J)\u2264k ) j\u2212i \u223c\n= H i (K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I\u2264k ) j\u2212i \u2295 H i (K[xn+1 , . . . , xn+m ]/J\u2264k ) j\u2212i\nm\n\nmn\n\nmm\n\nas K-vector spaces. Since the regularities of all modules in questions are greater or\nequal to 2, we obtain that reg S/F(I, J)\u2264k \u2264 k if and only if reg K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I\u2264k \u2264 k and\nreg K[xn+1 , . . ., xn+m ]/J\u2264k \u2264 k. As noted above, this concludes the proof.\n\u0003\nR EFERENCES\n[1] CoCoATeam, CoCoA: a system for doing Computations in Commutative Algebra. Available at\nhttp://cocoa.dima.unige.it.\n[2] A.
