It is possible that in most cooling-flow clusters\nradiative losses from the thermal plasma are balanced, over the cluster lifetime, by\nmechanical heating from the central radio source. We investigate the implications of\nthe variability of AGN mechanical luminosity Lm on observations of cooling flows and\nradio galaxies in general.\nIt is natural to assume that l = ln(Lm /LX ) is a Gaussian process. Then Lm will be\nlog-normally distributed at fixed cooling luminosity LX , and the variance in a measure of\nLm will increase with the time-resolution of the measure. We test the consistency of these\npredictions with existing data for cooling flows and radio galaxies. These tests hinge on\nthe power spectrum P (\u03c9) of the Gaussian process l(t). General considerations suggest\nthat P is a power law P \u223c \u03c9 \u2212\u03b2 . Long-term monitoring of Seyfert galaxies combined\nwith estimates of the duty cycle of quasars imply that \u03b2 \u2243 1, which corresponds to\nflicker noise. The power spectra of microquasars have similar values of \u03b2. We combine\na sample of sources in cooling flows that have cavities with the assumption that the\naverage mechanical luminosity of the AGN equals the cooling flow's X-ray luminosity.\nGiven that the mechanical luminosities are characterized by flicker noise, we find that\ntheir spectral amplitudes \u03c9P (\u03c9) lie between the estimated amplitudes of quasars and\nthe measured values for the radio luminosities of microquasars.\nThe model together with the observation that powerful radio galaxies lie within a\nnarrow range in optical luminosity, predicts the luminosity function of radio galaxies.\nBoth the shape and the normalization of the predicted function are in agreement with\nobservations. Forthcoming radio surveys will test the prediction that the luminosity\nfunction turns over at about the smallest luminosities so far probed.\nKey words: galaxies: clusters: general \u2013 cooling flows \u2013 galaxies: jets \u2013 radio continuum: galaxies \u2013 galaxies: luminosity function, mass function\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn the cores of the majority of rich galaxy clusters the radiative cooling time of the hot, X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM) is significantly shorter than the Hubble\ntime. In the absence of heat sources, the gas will cool and\nflow towards the bottom of the cluster potential well: hence\nthe name 'cooling-flow' clusters. In fact, recent X-ray observations \u2013 in particular XMM-Newton high-resolution spectroscopy \u2013 have ruled out the presence of significant cooling\nflows (Kaastra et al. 2001; Molendi & Pizzolato 2001; Peterson et al. 2001; Tamura et al. 2001; Kaastra et al. 2004, and\nreferences therein): the radiating gas in the cores of these\nclusters is heated somehow.\nThe most promising heating mechanism is feedback from\nthe Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) hosted by the central\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: nipoti@thphys.ox.ac.uk\n\nc 2005 RAS\n\ngalaxy of the cluster. The basic idea of this AGN/cooling-flow\nscenario is that the cooling ICM in the cluster core is heated\nby outbursts from the central AGN: an unsteady equilibrium\nmay be achieved, in the sense that the energy input from the\nAGN balances the radiative losses of the ICM over the lifetime of the cluster. Different models have been proposed in\nwhich the AGN heats the thermal plasma with either mechanical (Binney & Tabor 1993; Tabor & Binney 1995) or\nradiative feedback (Ciotti & Ostriker 1997, 2001; Ostriker &\nCiotti 2005). Although both processes might be effective to\nsome extent and possibly cooperate, here we focus on mechanical heating, whose relevance to many observed systems\nis apparent (e.g. Blanton et al. 2004 and Omma & Binney\n2004 and references therein).\nThe cooling luminosity LX can be determined directly\nfrom X-ray observations (e.g. Peres et al. 1998). By contrast,\nthe mechanical power Lm of the radio sources is not only\nmuch harder to determine observationally (e.g. Bicknell 1995;\n\n\f2\n\nC. Nipoti and J. Binney\n\nEilek 2004), but it is expected to be time-variable (e.g. Ulrich,\nMaraschi & Urry 1997). If Lm varies with time, how can it be\ncompared with the cooling luminosity in observed systems?\nThis paper addresses this question.\n\n2\n\nCONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK\n\nThe mechanical luminosity of an AGN is expected to fluctuate on time-scales that range from months to several gigayears, but from the point of view of the symbiosis between\nthe AGN and its cooling flow, only time-scales in excess of\n\u223c 10 Myr are of interest. It is clearly impossible to probe such\ntime-scales by monitoring individual AGN. Instead we must\ndraw inferences by studying the demography of AGN and\ncooling flows. Such studies are still in their infancy, but it is\nnevertheless worthwhile to develop a methodology that they\ncan employ, and to see what conclusions this methodology\nand currently available data lead us to.\nCooling flows vary in size from those associated with\nlarge clusters of galaxies, such as Abell 1795, to those associated with individual elliptical galaxies, such as NGC 4472.\nWe start by scaling out the variations in the mechanical luminosities Lm of AGN that simply reflect variations in size\nrather than temporal variability, by focusing on the dimensionless variable\n\nFigure 1. The probability for a log-normal distribution that a\nsingle measurement yields a value smaller than the expectation\nvalue.\n\nFigure 1 plots this function of \u03c3. When \u03c3 >\n\u223c 3, there is a high\nprobability of finding the luminosity to be smaller than its\nmean value because much of the total energy output comes\nduring infrequent outbursts.\nWe are interested in the properties of the light-curve\nobserved with a finite time-resolution, i.e., averaged over a\ngiven time \u2206t. We define this 'coarse-grained' light-curve as\nZ \u221e\nl\u2206t (t) =\ndt\u2032 F\u2206t (|t\u2032 \u2212 t|)l(t\u2032 ),\n(7)\n0\n\nL\u0303m = Lm /LX\n\n(1)\n\nwhere LX is the X-ray luminosity of the cooling flow, which\nis expected to vary at most slowly and weakly with time. The\nlogarithm of L\u0303m ,\nl \u2261 ln (Lm /LX ) ,\n\n(2)\n\nis a continuous random variable defined on the interval\n(\u2212\u221e, \u221e). Throughout physics one models such a variable\nthrough the Fourier representation\nZ\nl(t) = d\u03c9 A\u03c9 e\u0131\u03c9t .\n(3)\nThe complex numbers A\u03c9 are random variables. The simplest conjecture is that these variables are statistically independent of one another, and have phases that are uniformly\ndistributed in (0, 2\u03c0). In this case l(t) is a Gaussian random process, and it is completely characterized by the power\nspectrum P (\u03c9) \u2261 h|A\u03c9 |2 i. The probability density of the luminosity at any given time t is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(l \u2212 hli)2\n1\ndl,\n(4)\nexp \u2212\nP(L\u0303m )dL\u0303m = \u221a\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c0\u03c3\nwhere \u03c3 2 = h(l \u2212 hli)2 i is the variance of l. It is easy to show\nthat with this model the expectation value of the nth power\nof L\u0303m is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\n2\u03c3\nhL\u0303n\n.\n(5)\nm i = exp nhli + n\n2\nThe appearance of \u03c3 2 in the exponential signals the skewness of the probability distribution (4). The larger the value\nof n, the more important this skewness is in the sense that\nrare excursions to high L\u0303m more strongly dominate hL\u0303n\nm i. A\nmeasure of the importance of skewness is the probability that\nan individual measurement of L\u0303m will return a value smaller\nthan hL\u0303m i. One can readily show that\nP (L\u0303m < hL\u0303m i) = 21 [1 + erf(\u03c3/23/2 )].\n\n(6)\n\nR\nwhere the filter function F\u2206t (t) satisfies dt F\u2206t = 1 and is\nnon\u2013zero in a region of width \u2206t around the origin. l\u2206t (t)\nhas average\nZ\n1 t \u2032\ndt l\u2206t (t\u2032 ) = hli,\n(8)\nhl\u2206t i = lim\nt\u2192\u221e t 0\nand variance1\nZ\n1 t\n2\n\u03c3\u2206t\n= lim\ndt (l\u2206t (t\u2032 ) \u2212 hli)2\nt\u2192\u221e t 0\nZ \u221e\n2\n=\nd\u03c9 F\u0302\u2206t\n(\u03c9)P (\u03c9)\n\n(9)\n\n0\n\nwhere F\u0302\u2206t (\u03c9) is the Fourier transform of the filter F\u2206t (t).\n2\nApproximating the window function F\u0302\u2206t\n(\u03c9) with the Heaviside step function \u03b8(1 \u2212 \u03c9/\u03c9\u2206t ), where \u03c9\u2206t = 2\u03c0/\u2206t, we get\n2\n\u03c3\u2206t\n\u2243\n\nZ\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\n\nd\u03c9 P (\u03c9).\n\n(10)\n\n0\n\nIn words, contributions to the variance on time-scales shorter\nthan \u2206t vanish in the averaging process.

If \u03b2 differed significantly from unity, we would expect the amplitudes to be many orders of magnitude different, so we must\nhave \u03b2 \u2243 1.\n\nwhere P0 is the power at some reference frequency \u03c90 , \u03c9min =\n2\u03c0/tmax and \u03c9max \u2261 2\u03c0/tmin . tmin and tmax are, respectively,\nthe maximum and minimum time-scale of variability.\nThere is no difficulty in principle in deriving equations\nfor a general power-law index \u03b2, but we shall argue that \u03b2\nmust lie close to unity, and the discussion is greatly simplified\nif we specialize to \u03b2 = 1 at this point. The case \u03b2 = 1\nis associated with 'flicker noise', which empirically arises in\ndiverse physical phenomena that range from electrical noise,\nto wind speeds, to earthquake magnitudes (e.g. Press 1978;\nMilotti 2002). In case of flicker noise the relation between the\nvariance and the power spectrum is\n\n2.1.2\n\n2\n\u03c3\u2206t\n= P0 \u03c90 ln\n\n\u03c9\u2206t\ntmax\n= P0 \u03c90 ln\n.\n\u03c9min\n\u2206t\n\n(12)\n\nThe amplitude of flicker noise is conveniently characterized\nby the dimensionless quantity \u03c9P (\u03c9), which is independent\nof \u03c9.\n2.1.1\n\nCalibration with quasars\n\nThe variability of X-ray emission from AGN has been studied\non time-scales shorter than \u223c 10 yr. When the X-ray power\nspectra2 of Seyfert galaxies at frequencies 10\u22128 \u221210\u22125 Hz are\nfitted with a power-law, one finds \u03b2 \u223c 1 (for instance, \u03b2 \u2243\n1.05+0.15\n\u22120.20 for the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4051), with amplitudes\nP (\u03c9) \u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.04 (Uttley, McHardy & Papadakis 2002;\nMcHardy et al. 2004). Hence, the only power-law indices that\nwe can consistently adopt are \u03b2 \u2243 1.\nThere is a vast difference between the longest time-scales\non which the power spectra have been empirically deter7\nmined, and the time-scales >\n\u223c 10 yr of interest here. Hence\nto extrapolate blindly from the observed <\n\u223c 10 yr fluctuations\nout to 107 yr ones is a very hazardous proceeding. Fortunately, independent estimates of the duty cycle of quasars\nprovides a degree of reassurance. Ciotti & Ostriker (2001)\ndefine the duty cycle of a source with light-curve L(t) as\n\u03b4\u2261\n\n2\nhLi2\n= e\u2212\u03c3 ,\nhL2 i\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the second equality follows from equation (5). Various arguments indicate that quasars, over the lifetime of\ntheir host galaxies have duty cycles \u03b4 \u223c 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22122 , with\nepisodic lifetime (i.e., duration of individual major outbursts)\n4\n>\n\u223c 10 yr (Haehnelt, Natarajan & Rees 1998; Yu & Tremaine\n2002; Martini & Schneider 2003; Haiman, Ciotti & Ostriker\n2004). By equation (13), these duty cycles require variances in the range \u223c 4.6 \u2212 6.9. Inserting these variances\nand the time-scale range 104 \u2212 1010 yr into equation (12),\nwe find that the associated flicker spectra have amplitudes\nP0 \u03c90 \u223c 0.3 \u2212 0.5. These values are larger by a factor \u223c 30\n\nMicroquasars are radio-jet emitting X-ray binaries made up\nby a stellar-mass black hole (BH) and a companion star, and\nseem in many respects small-scale versions of AGN (Mirabel\n& Rodriguez 1999). It is widely accepted that on small to\nintermediate scales these objects are identical to AGN scaled\ndown in both length- and time-scales by the ratio of the\nblack holes' Schwarzschild radii rg \u2261 2GMBH /c2 . Hence, we\ncan study the temporal variability of microquasars on human time-scales to get information about the variability of\nAGN on time-scales much longer than those that can be directly probed. It seems likely that the scaling holds at out\nto time-scales3 \u223c 105 yr, which for an AGN black-hole mass\n107 \u2212 108 M\u2299 corresponds to a readily observed frequency\n10\u22125 Hz in microquasars. Thus from studies of microquasars\nwe can estimate the amplitude of the AGN power spectrum\nat frequencies corresponding to 105 yr, and then use our\nknowledge that \u03b2 cannot significantly differ from unity to\nextrapolate it to frequencies lower by a factor \u223c 100.\nMost studies of the low-frequency power spectrum of microquasars focus on X-ray emission. Reig, Papadakis & Kylafis (2002) find that the power spectrum of the microquasar\nGRS 1915+105 is well fitted by a power law (equation 11)\nwith index \u03b2 \u2243 1 in the frequency range 10\u22127 to 10\u22125 Hz.\nA power spectrum with this slope, over the same frequency\nrange, has been also found for the X-ray light curve of Cygnus\nX-3 by Choudhury et al. (2004).\nHowever, we are interested in the variability of the kinetic power of the jet, which is expected to be traced by radio\nemission rather than by X-rays. The radio variability of microquasars has not been investigated as much as their X-ray\nvariability. A spectral analysis was carried out by Fiedler at\nal. (1987) for the radio (2.25 and 8.3 GHz) light curve of\nthe peculiar microquasar SS 433: they found that its power\nspectrum is consistent with a power law with index \u03b2 \u2243 1\nat frequencies 10\u22127 to 10\u22126 Hz (see also Revnivtsev et al.\n2005). Nipoti, Blundell & Binney (2005) show that at these\nlow frequencies the slopes of the radio power spectra of the\nmicroquasars Cygnus X-3 and GRS 1915+105 are similar to\nthose found in X-rays.\nThe X-ray light-curve of GRS 1915+105 has power spectrum with amplitude P0 \u03c90 \u223c 0.02 at frequencies 10\u22127 to\n10\u22125 Hz (Reig et al. 2002). An amplitude smaller by a factor\nof \u223c 10 has been measured for the X-ray power spectrum\nof Cygnus X-3 in the same frequency range (Choudhury et\nal. 2004). However, there is evidence that the amplitude of\nthe variability of the radio emission of these powerful microquasars is larger than that of their X-ray emission (Nipoti\net al. 2005). The radio emission of Cygnus X-3 (at 2.25 and\n\n3\n\n2\n\nThe authors consider the power spectrum of L(t) normalized to\nhLi2 , while here we refer to the power spectrum of l(t) \u2261 ln L(t):\nhowever, the two have the same slope and amplitude as long as\nthe variance of L(t) is small with respect to hLi2 .\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\nCalibration from microquasars\n\nFor the accretion disk of a \u223c 108 M\u2299 BH, the characteristic\nviscous time-scale at \u223c 103 rg is roughly 105 yr. Longer time-scales\ncorrespond to larger radii, at which AGN accretion disks might be\ntruncated by self-gravity (e.g. Burderi, King & Szuszkiewicz 1998;\nGoodman 2003).\n\n\f4\n\nC. Nipoti and J. Binney\nvations of the jet and the very inner hot atmosphere are available (Owen, Eilek & Kassim 2000; Di Matteo et al. 2003). In\nthe case of the central radio sources in galaxy clusters Lm\ncan be estimated from depressions in the X-ray emission of\nthe surrounding ICM. These 'cavities' are interpreted as bubbles produced in the interaction between the jets of the radio\nsource and the thermal plasma. The energy transferred to the\nICM by a bubble expanding adiabatically is (e.g. Churazov\net al. 2000, 2002)\nEb =\n\n\u03b3\npV,\n\u03b3\u22121\n\n(14)\n\nwhere V is the volume of the bubble, p is the pressure of\nthe surrounding ICM, and \u03b3 is the adiabatic index of the\ngas in the bubble. Thus, Eb = 52 pV for a non-relativistic\ngas (\u03b3 = 53 ), and Eb = 4pV for a relativistic fluid (\u03b3 = 43 ).\nGiven a characteristic time \u2206tb associated with the bubble,\nan estimate of the average kinetic luminosity of the AGN\nover \u2206tb is then\nLm =\n\nFigure 2.

If we adopt tmax = 19 yr, \u2206t = 1 day for\nthe boundaries of the frequency range sampled, equation (12)\nimplies that the power spectrum of the radio emission has\namplitude P0 \u03c90 \u2243 0.11, about two orders of magnitude\nlarger than that found in X-rays. Similarly, we estimated the\namplitude of the radio power spectrum of the microquasar\nGRS 1915+105, using its 2.25-GHz light-curve obtained by\nthe GBI monitoring program over about 6 yr (see Foster\net al. 1996). We found that GRS 1915+105 has amplitude\nP0 \u03c90 \u2243 0.12 at 2.25 GHz, also much larger than in X-rays.\nThus, observations of microquasars suggest P0 \u03c90 \u223c 0.1 as\na plausible value of the amplitude of the very low-frequency\npower spectrum of radio sources. Given the substantial uncertainies involved, this estimate is in remarkably good agreement with the estimate P0 \u03c90 \u223c 0.4 that we obtained by\nconsidering the duty cycle of quasars.\nThese considerations suggest that we can obtain an impression of the long-term variability of AGN by rescaling the\nradio-frequency light curve of a microquasar. Fig. 2 is a plot\nof the daily-averaged 2.25 GHz light-curve of Cygnus X-3\nrescaled in time by 108 . The light curve is characterized by\nshort powerful outbursts, alternating with periods of quiescence.\n\n3\n3.1\n\n(15)\n\nThe definition of \u2206tb is controversial: if we consider \u2206tb\nas the age of the bubble, this is of order the time tcs required\nfor the cavity to rise at the speed of sound from the centre to\nits current location (Gull & Northover 1973; Churazov et al.\n2001). Alternatively, the age of the bubble can be defined as\nthe time required for the ICM to refill the displaced volume\n(McNamara et al. 2000). However, \u2206tb is not necessarily the\nage of the bubble: it could be the recurrence time trec of\nthe radio source, defined as the time elapsing between two\nsubsequent outbursts in which the jet blows bubbles. As we\nare looking for the characteristic time to be associated with\nthis measure of Lm (i.e., the time over which we average in\nmeasuring from the bubbles), it is natural to identify \u2206tb\nwith trec , so in the rest of the paper we assume \u2206tb \u2261 trec .\nB\u0131\u0302rzan et al. (2004, hereafter B04) present radio and\nX-ray data for a sample of 18 systems with cooling flows\nthat show evidence of cavities in their diffuse X-ray emission.\nThe sample consists of 16 galaxy clusters, the galaxy group\nHCG 62, and the elliptical galaxy M84. The authors provide\nfor each of these objects the cooling luminosity (LX ), the\nmonochromatic radio luminosity at 1.4 GHz (L1.4 ), the integrated radio luminosity between 10 MHz and 5 GHz (Lrad ),\nand measures of pV for each cavity. This sample is suitable for\ncomparison with the AGN/cooling flow model, because for\neach source different measurements of the mechanical power\n(averaged on different time-scales) are available.\nFrom measures of pV we derive Lm and L\u0303m = Lm /LX using equation (15), given the time-scale \u2206tb = trec . In general,\nwe do not know the recurrence time for individual sources.\nIn the Perseus cluster, in which two generations of bubbles\nare observed (Fabian et al. 2000), the recurrence time-scale is\nof the order of 100 Myr. Estimating trec for other sources, in\nwhich just one generation of cavities is observed, is problematic, but statistical arguments suggest trec \u223c few \u00d7 100 Myr\nas a typical value (B04). So we assume that \u2206tb is the same\nfor all sources, and we parameterize Lm as\n\nAPPLICATION TO COOLING FLOWS\n\nLm = fb\n\nSystems with cavities\n\nIn general, it is not feasible to measure directly the mechanical power of radio sources.

It is clear that\nthe radio power represents a very small fraction of the kinetic power emitted by the AGN (e.g. Eilek 2004), but the\nradio luminosity may be a useful indicator of the mechanical\npower. Hence, much larger samples could be assembled if it\nwere possible to establish a relation between the mechanical\nand radio luminosities of sources.\nCavities in the X-ray emitting ICM are classified as\nradio-filled if non-thermal radio emission at a given frequency\ncoincides with the X-ray-depressed area; otherwise they are\ncalled 'ghost' cavities4 . If reacceleration of the synchrotron\nelectrons is negligible, the age of the radio-filled bubbles will\nbe of the order of the synchrotron lifetime, or smaller, while\nthe age of the ghosts will be longer. Thus, from radio-filled\ncavities we can independently measure Lm \u2243 Eb /tcs and L1.4\nand thus determine the relation that holds between them.\nThe top panel of Fig. 4 plots data for the nine objects5\n4 This classification depends on the frequency of the radio emission. Cavities classified as ghosts on the basis of \u223c GHz radio data\nmight appear as radio-filled at lower frequencies, depending on the\nbreak frequency of the radio spectrum.

Actually, tsync\nrepresents an upper limit on the lifetime of the radio-emitting\nelectrons because adiabatic expansion losses are expected to\nbe dominant over radiative losses (e.g. Blundell & Rawlings\n2000). As the effects of adiabatic expansion losses are difficult to quantify in general, in our treatment we simply assume that the averaging time-scale is <\n\u223c tsync (\u03bd), when Lm is\nmeasured from radio luminosity at frequency \u03bd.\nFig. 6 plots the three ranges of acceptable values of\n\u03c3 2 that we have derived above against the characteristic\naveraging time \u2206t associated with each measurement.

Here we discuss the\nconsequences of extending the considered picture to coolingflow systems in general. In particular, applying our model to\nluminous early-type galaxies leads to predictions on the local\nradio luminosity function.\nRadio galaxies, though spanning several orders of magnitude in radio power, represent a very homogeneous family of objects when the properties of their host stellar systems are considered, being early-type galaxies with optical\nluminosity larger than L\u22c6 . For instance, Magliocchetti et al.\n(2002) derived the local radio luminosity function for AGN\nand early-type galaxies of the FIRST-2dF Galaxy Redshift\nSurvey (2dFGRS), finding that the optical counterparts have\nB-band luminosity characterized by a very narrow distribution, with average MB \u2212 5 log h = \u221219.95 and scatter 0.41\nmag [h \u2261 H0 /(100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ), where H0 is the Hubble\nconstant].\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n7\n\nFigure 7. Local radio luminosity function of early-type galaxies. Points with error bars are data from the FIRST-2dFGRS\n(Magliocchetti et al. 2002). The dashed line is the best\u2013fitting\nlog-normal distribution (equation 23).\n\nLet us assume that all bright elliptical galaxies have a\ncooling core, a central supermassive BH, and that, over the\ngalaxy lifetime, the radiative losses from their hot plasma are\nbalanced by the mechanical energy emitted in radio outbursts\nfrom the central AGN (hLm i = LX ). The radio luminosity\nof the AGN will be strongly variable, and poorly correlated\nwith the cooling luminosity of the host cooling core. However,\nunder the assumption that the monochromatic 1.4 GHz radio\nluminosity traces the kinetic luminosity (Lm = \u03ba1.4 L1.4 ), for\na sample of galaxies with the same cooling luminosity LX , we\nwould expect hL1.4 i = LX /\u03ba1.4 . If \u03a8(LX ) is the distribution\nof the cooling luminosities of bright early-type galaxies, the\nradio luminosity function of early-type galaxies will be given\nby\nZ\n\u03a6(L1.4 ) = dLX \u03a8(LX )P(L1.4 ; LX ),\n(21)\nwhere P(L1.4 ; LX ) is a log-normal distribution with hL1.4 i =\n2\nLX /\u03ba1.4 and variance \u03c31.4\n. The luminosity function \u03a8(LX )\nhas yet to be determined observationally, because of the lack\nof complete X-ray samples of early-type galaxies. As well\nknown, the diffuse X-ray luminosity of early-type galaxies\nwith similar optical luminosity is characterized by significant scatter (Fabbiano, Gioia & Trinchieri 1989; O'Sullivan,\nForbes & Ponman 2001). Given that the optical luminosity\nis roughly the same for all sources, it is natural to model the\ndistribution of LX as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nN0\n(lX \u2212 hlX i)2\n\u03a8(LX )dLX = \u221a\nexp \u2212\ndlX ,\n(22)\n2\n2\u03c3X\n2\u03c0\u03c3X\n2\nwhere lX = ln(LX ), \u03c3X\nis the logarithmic variance and N0 is\nthe number density. Substituting \u03a8(LX ) and P(L1.4 ; LX ) in\nequation (21) we get\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(l1.4 \u2212 ln L\u22c61.4 )2\nN0\nexp \u2212\ndl1.4 , (23)\n\u03a6(L1.4 )dL1.4 = \u221a\n2\u03c3\u22c62\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u22c6\n\n\f8\n\nC. Nipoti and J. Binney\n\n2\n2\nwhere l1.4 = ln(L1.4 ), \u03c3\u22c62 = \u03c31.4\n+ \u03c3X\n, and ln L\u22c61.4 =\n2\nhlX i \u2212 ln \u03ba1.4 \u2212 \u03c31.4 /2. Thus, our model predicts that the radio luminosity function of early-type galaxies is log-normal\n2\n2\n2\nwith variance \u03c31.4\n+ \u03c3X\n, where \u03c31.4\nis the variance due to\n2\nradio-variability of each source and \u03c3X\nis the variance in the\ndistribution of X-ray emission of bright ellipticals.\nWe test this prediction by fitting the local radio luminosity function of early-type galaxies of the FIRST2dFGRS (Magliocchetti et al. 2002) with equation (23), leaving \u03c3\u22c62 , L\u22c61.4 and N0 as free parameters. We found best\u2013\nfitting parameters (with 1 \u03c3 uncertainties) \u03c3\u22c62 = 7.3 \u00b1 1.0,\nL\u22c61.4 = 1036.5\u00b10.2 erg s\u22121 , and N0 = (1.2 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7\n10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 . Fig. 7 plots the data and error bars as reported by Magliocchetti et al. (2002) together with our best\u2013\nfitting log-normal function. We note that the best\u2013fit gives\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c31.4\n+\u03c3X\n\u2243 7.3, consistent with values of \u03c31.4\nfound analysing\nB04's sample of central radio galaxies in cooling cores (Section 3.2) plus a contribution from intrinsic scatter in X-ray\nluminosity.\nWe based our analysis of the radio luminosity function\non the assumption that most bright elliptical and S0 galaxies have AGN-powered radio emission. We can check this\nassumption a posteriori by comparing the best\u2013fitting number density N0 with the number density of luminous earlytype galaxies. We assume that the B-band optical luminosity\nfunction of early-type galaxies \u03c6(LB ) is a Schechter function\nwith slope \u03b1, characteristic luminosity L\u22c6B , and normalization\n\u03c6\u22c6 . Then the Rnumber density of objects brighter than LB is\n\u221e\nNB (> LB ) = L dL\u2032B \u03c6(L\u2032B ) = \u03c6\u22c6 \u0393(\u03b1+1, LB /L\u22c6B ). If we conB\nsider the best\u2013fitting B-band luminosity function determined\nby Madgwick et al. (2002) for the early-type galaxies of the\n2dFGRS [\u03b1 = \u22120.54\u00b10.02, \u03c6\u22c6 = (9.9\u00b10.5)\u00d710\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 ],\nand we assume that all early-type galaxies with LB > L\u22c6B\nare radio galaxies, we find a number density NB (> L\u22c6B ) =\n(2.7 \u00b1 0.1) \u00d7 10\u22123 h3 Mpc\u22123 . Thus, NB (> L\u22c6B ) is a factor of\n\u223c 2 larger than N0 found from our best\u2013fitting log-normal\ndistribution. The discrepancy between the two number densities is easily explained by our arbitrary choice of L\u22c6B as\nthe minimum B-band luminosity of a radio galaxy, and by\nuncertainties on the faint-end of radio luminosity function.\nWe conclude that available radio data are consistent\nwith the proposed scenario, in which each bright elliptical\noscillates, over its lifetime, along the radio luminosity function, spanning several orders of magnitude in radio power.\nInterestingly, results of high-redshift radio surveys also suggest that most massive ellipticals have experienced one or\nmore episodes of powerful radio activity during their lifetime\n(Rawlings 2003). Finally, we stress that the proposed picture\nnaturally explains the very large scatter in radio luminosity\nfor radio galaxies with the same BH mass (Lacy et al. 2001;\nMcLure et al. 2004, and references therein) as a consequence\nof the strong time-variability of their radio emission (see also\nNipoti et al. 2005).\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nSince the cosmic density of matter is very inhomogeneous\non small scales, it is not possible to derive its global properties from individual measurements of the density in small\nregions: the characteristics of large-scale structure must be\ndetermined from a model of the fluctuating density field, and\nthe values that one derives from it of statistical quantities,\nsuch as the mass variance. Similarly, the temporal variability\n\nof AGN is too large to ignore. We cannot hope to understand\nthe radio luminosity function, or to test the AGN/coolingflow model, without a model of AGN variability.\nThe normalized mechanical luminosities of a sample of\nAGN, L\u0303m = Lm /LX , should show scatter only because of\ntemporal variability, and be free of differences in the scales\nof systems. Since the variability of AGN is known to be large\nand L\u0303m is an inherently positive variable, the natural variable\nto model is l = ln(L\u0303m ), and the default assumption to make\nis that l(t) is a Gaussian random process. This assumption\nimplies that individual measures of L\u0303m should have a lognormal distribution, so the time-sequence of Lm is completely\ncharacterized by the power spectrum P (\u03c9) of l(t).\nThe enormous range of physical scales involved in AGN\nsuggests that the power spectrum will be a power law P (\u03c9) \u223c\n\u03c9 \u2212\u03b2 . Several considerations suggest that \u03b2 \u2243 1, the index\ncharacteristic of flicker noise. First, on the short time-scales\nthat are directly accessible, monitoring of AGN yields \u03b2 \u2243 1.\nSecond, a comparison of the amplitudes measured in these\nstudies with that inferred from the short duty cycle of quasars\nrequires \u03b2 \u2243 1. Third, microquasars, whose power spectra\ncan be probed over a camparatively wide range of frequencies, are found to have \u03b2 \u2243 1. Finally, diverse physical phenomena are found to be characterized by flicker-noise power\nspectra, so it would not be surprising if AGN conformed to\nthis pattern.\nWe estimate the spectral amplitude of the mechanical luminosity of AGN at the centres of cooling flows by assuming\nthat energy radiated by the thermal plasma is on the average replaced by the mechanical input of the central AGN,\nand that X-ray cavities probe the mechanical luminosity averaged over time-scales \u223c 108 yr. The amplitudes required\nare slightly larger than those that characterize the radio output of two microquasars, and of the order of those estimated\nfrom the duty cycle of quasars.\nWe estimate the coefficients \u03ba in an assumed proportionality between the mechanical luminosity of an AGN and\nits radio power, either at 1.4 GHz or bolometric. We do this\nin two ways. In the first we directly fit a straight line to\nthe correlation between radio and mechanical luminosities of\nsources that have radio-loud cavities. Alternatively, we fit our\nmodel of AGN variability to the radio data of all sources with\ncavities, whether radio-loud or ghost, under the assumption\nthat hLm i = LX . The two methods yield compatible ranges\nof values of \u03ba.\nThe available observations fail to constrain the model's\nparameters strongly, both because the currently available\nsample of sources is small and because our understanding of\nthe physics of these sources is poor. Despite the significant\nadvance that was made possible by the discovery of numbers of X-ray cavities, measurements of the ratio of radio\nto mechanical luminosity are still extremely uncertain. Also,\nour analysis clearly shows the importance of determining the\nduty cycle of the radio sources in order to quantify their contribution in the energetics of cooling flows: in particular, it\nis crucial to estimate the amplitude of their power spectrum\non time-scales >\n\u223c 10 Myr. We conclude that larger samples\nof AGN/cooling-flow pairs and better theoretical models of\nradio sources are needed to challenge the AGN/cooling-flow\nmodel.\nIn a scenario in which AGN radio activity is strongly\nvariable with time, the local luminosity function of radio\ngalaxies should be interpreted as the distribution of the time\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u20139\n\n\fAGN variability and cooling flows\nspent by a galaxy at a given radio luminosity rather than\na distribution of sources with different intrinsic properties.\nThis picture is supported by the observational finding that\nearly-type galaxies hosting supermassive BHs with the same\nmass span several orders of magnitude in radio power. We\nshowed that the FIRST-2dFGRS luminosity function of radio\ngalaxies can be fitted by a log-normal distribution, consistent\nwith the hypothesis that in all early-type galaxies, the cooling flow is balanced by a strongly variable radio source. Our\nmodel predicts a turnover at luminosities similar to the lowest\ncurrently probed. Any turnover in the luminosity function of\nAGN will be to a large extent masked by radio emission from\nnuclear starbursts. Nonetheless, the prediction of a turnover\nis interesting and will be tested by forthcoming radio surveys\nwith instruments such as the Square Kilometer Array.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to Katherine M.
