These are ubi ompounds where\na divalent [1\u2104 lanthanoid o upies the entral position on\na ube, surrounded by eight B6 o tahedra at ea h vertex. Boron atoms make up a rigid age, held together by\novalent bonds between neighboring B atoms. Our fous will be on the results known for Eu1\u2212x Cax B6 . EuB6\nis a ferromagneti metal, ordering at TC \u2248 15 K, and\nhara terized by a quite small e\u001be tive arrier density, of\norder of 10\u22123 per unit ell, at high temperatures [2, 3, 4\u2104.\nMagnetism is found to arise from the half-\u001clled 4f shell\nof Eu, whose lo alized ele trons a ount for the measured\nmagneti moment of 7 \u03bcB per formula unit [3, 4, 5\u2104. The\nFM transition temperature is reported to de rease with\nin reasing Ca ontent [4, 6\u2104 and the totally substituted\nompound CaB6 exhibits no magnetism.\nIn this paper we propose a simple model that des ribes\nquantitatively the properties revealed by the experiments\ndone in EuB6 : (i) a pre ipitous drop in the DC resistivity\njust below TC , with a hange by a fa tor as high as 50\nbetween TC and the lowest temperatures [3, 4\u2104; (ii) the\nlarge negative magnetoresistan e observed near TC ; (iii)\nan in rease in the number of arriers, by a fa tor of 2 \u0015 3,\nupon entering the ordered phase, as eviden ed by Hall\ne\u001be t [4\u2104; (iv) a large blue shift of the plasma edge, seen\nalso for T \u2264 TC , both in re\u001de tivity, R(\u03c9), and polar Kerr\nrotation [2, 7, 8\u2104; (v) a s aling of the plasma frequen y\nwith the magnetization. The above listed features onstitute a ase for the strong oupling of the magnetization\nto the transport properties.\nThe e\u001be ts of hemi al doping with non-magneti Ca\nare also onsidered, and the theory explains qualitatively\nthe following experimental \u001cndings: (1) with doping, x,\nthe metalli regime, found in EuB6 (x = 0), evolves to a\nsemi ondu ting behavior above TC [4, 6\u2104; (2) just below\nTC the arrier density in reases by at least two orders\n\nof magnitude [4\u2104; (3) the plasma edge is visibly smeared\nwhile the orresponding resonan e in the polar Kerr rotation is greatly attenuated [9, 10\u2104; (4) \u03c1(T, H) and \u03c9p\ndisplay an exponential dependen e in the magnetization\n[6, 11\u2104; (5) there remains a signi\u001c ant and rapid de rease\nof \u03c1(T ) just below TC , albeit by a smaller fa tor than in\nthe undoped ase. Our model predi ts that the square of\nthe plasma frequen y, \u03c9p2 , s ales linearly with the Curie\ntemperature, TC , as doping x is varied. Furthermore, we\nalso present a phase diagram T versus x whi h ontains\ntwo phase transition lines: paramagneti to ferromagneti and metal to insulator.\nTheoreti al understanding of the mi ros opi me hanisms responsible for the transport data is still ontroversial. Earlier lo al density approximation (LDA) alulations predi ted semi-metalli hara ter with an overlap of ondu tion and valen e bands at the Fermi level\non the X point of the Brillouin zone [12, 13\u2104. This\nappears to be onsistent with the Shubnikov\u0015de Haas\nand de Haas\u0015van Alphen measurements [14, 15\u2104. Further density fun tional theory (DFT) al ulations showed\nthe existen e of a sizeable gap of \u223c 1 eV. These results\nare orroborated by angle resolved photoemission spe tros opy (ARPES) for magneti [16\u2104 and non-magneti\nhexaborides [17\u2104. Some existing theoreti al models assume the semimetal s enario [11, 18, 19\u2104, that ARPES\nseems to rule out.\nWe present a mi ros opi theory for EuB6 , involving\na single ondu tion band, onsistent with the observed\nproperties of these ompounds, and make spe i\u001c predi tions regarding the phase diagram for Eu1\u2212x Cax B6 .\nThe presen e of defe ts in the rystalline environment\n[16, 20, 21\u2104 is believed to reate a small arrier on entration in the ondu tion band. These arriers intera t\nwith the lo al Eu magneti moments in a ubi latti e,\nvia an s\u0015f ex hange oupling, leading to the well known\nKondo latti e Hamiltonian:\n\u0011\nX \u0010\nX\n~Si * ~si , (1)\nti,j c\u2020i,\u03c3 cj,\u03c3 + h. . + J\nHKL = \u2212\nhi,ji\u03c3\n\ni\n\n\f2\n\nhi,ji\n\nti,j\n=\nThe e\u001be tive hoping amplitude is e\nt cos (\u03b8i /2) cos (\u03b8j /2) + sin (\u03b8i /2) sin (\u03b8j /2) e\u2212i(\u03c6i \u2212\u03c6j ) .\nThe Hamiltonian (2) des ribes a very interesting interplay between the magneti and ele troni degrees of\nfreedom. The spin texture a ts as a stati disordered\nba kground for the ele troni motion [24\u2104. The ground\nstate of the problem is obtained by minimizing the kineti\nenergy with the alignment of all the spins in the system.\nThus, the ele troni density of state (DOS), N (E, M ),\nand the Fermi energy, EF (M ), hange with magnetization, M , even if the number of ele trons is onstant. In\nthis ferromagneti state the transport properties are tied\nto the magneti ones. Similar physi s an be found in the\nontext of the olossal magnetoresistan e (CMR) manganites [25\u2104. This is indeed an intrinsi ally disordered\nproblem where the strength of the non-diagonal disorder\nis determined by M . A mobility edge, EC (M ), appears\nin the spe tral density [26\u2104 and strongly depends on M .\nIn the absen e of stru tural disorder, when the system is\nfully magnetized (M = 1) the mobility edge moves out\nof the band. One immediately realizes that in the paramagneti phase (M = 0), if EC (0) and EF (M = 0) are\nomparable, the onset of ferromagnetism at TC and the\non omitant displa ement of EC towards the bottom of\nthe band, have a major e\u001be t in the transport properties,\nby allowing more states to be ome delo alized and onsequently in reasing the ondu tivity. This was a tually\na on ept that lingered for some time in the ontext of\nthe manganites where the metal\u0015insulator transition and\nCMR were assumed to stem from this e\u001be t [27\u2104. In that\nase spin disorder alone annot a ount for the experimental eviden e sin e EC (0) en loses less than 0.5 % of\nthe states [28\u2104.

Given the large value of\nS , the ore spins are treated as lassi al variables parameterized by the polar and azimuthal angles as ~Si =\nS (sin \u03b8i cos \u03c6i , sin \u03b8i sin \u03c6i , cos \u03b8i ). Based on the urrent\nliterature, reasonable ranges for the model parameters\nare tij = t \u223c 0.1\u00151 eV and JS \u223c 0.35\u00150.7 eV.\nThe arrier on entration in EuB6 (n \u223c 10\u22123 ) is very\nsmall, and therefore the mean kineti energy is mu h\nsmaller than the magneti one, hKi \u223c tn \u226a JS . In\nthis regime, the low energy physi s of Hamiltonian (1)\nan be obtained by taking the limit of J \u2192 \u221e [22\u2104. The\ne\u001be tive Hamiltonian is obtained by proje ting out the\nstates with the ele troni spin parallel (for J > 0) or antiparallel (for J < 0) to the lo al ore spin ~Si .

In order to investigate the aforementioned, we al ulate N (E, M ) and EC (M ) for the Hamiltonian (2) for stati spin on\u001cgurations with spe i\u001c values of M . The full, self- onsistent treatment of the\nmagnetism of Hamiltonian (2) is omputationally too\ndemanding for the system sizes required to study loalization e\u001be ts. In this work we ir umvent these\ndi\u001e ulties by assuming un orrelated spins in an external \u001celd and extra ting the temperature dependen e of\nthe zero-\u001celd magnetization, M (T ), from the experimental data [5\u2104. The re ursion method [29\u2104 was used\nto al ulate N (E, M ), and EC (M ) was lo ated using\nthe transfer matrix method [30, 31\u2104. Non-magneti defe ts were a ounted by a small magnetization indepeneC (M ) =\ndent shift, EW , of EC , thus giving e\u001be tively E\nEW + EC (M ). The important quantity is the mobileC (M ) \u2212 EF (M ) < 0, the variation\nity gap, \u2206(M ) = E\nof whi h, at the transition, ompletely determines the\nnumber of extended (metalli ) arriers, ne (M ). Tuning\nEF (0) so that n0e \u2261 ne (0) = 0.003, as reported in the\ntransport measurements above TC , the variation of ne is\npresented in Fig. 1. \u2206(M ) is found to be almost linear in\nM : \u2206(M ) = \u22060 (1 \u2212 \u03b1M ) (see the inset in Fig. 1). The\nrange of variation of ne in Fig. 1 ompares well with the\ndata obtained from the Hall e\u001be t by Pas hen et al. [4\u2104.\nAnother experimentally a essible quantity is the\nplasma frequen y, \u03c9p . Applying the Kubo formula for\nthe opti al ondu tivity, \u03c3(\u03c9), to Hamiltonian (2) the\nsum rule for its real part, \u03c3 \u2032 (\u03c9), an be extra ted [32\u2104 and\nombined with the opti al sum rule [33\u2104 leading to the\nplasma frequen y for the model \u03c9p2 = \u22124\u03c0e2 a2 hHi /3.\nIn the reported experimental results [7\u2104, \u03c9p2 is obtained\nfrom the Drude ontribution to the opti al response of\nthe material. Therefore, in order to ompare with the\n\n\f3\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\nM\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n6\n\n5.0\u00d710\n\n7\n\n1.0\u00d710\n\n7\n\n1.5\u00d710\n2\n-2\n\u03c9p (cm )\n\n7\n\n2.0\u00d710\n\n7\n\n2.5\u00d710\n\nFigure 2: Result for \u03c9p2 (M ) obtained from the sum rule ( irles) and experimental data (diamonds). The experimental\n(H = 0) points were obtained ombining \u03c9p2 (T ) at zero \u001celd\nfrom ref. [7\u2104 with the zero \u001celd M (T ) from ref. [5\u2104.\n\nmodel predi tions, we in luded only the ontribution of\nmetalli states\nR \u221e in the al ulation of the kineti energy,\n\u03c9p2 (M ) \u223c Ec(M) N (E, M )f (E)EdE . The out ome of\nsu h pro edure being shown in Fig. 2. The linear relation \u03c9p2 \u223c M inferred from ref. [34\u2104, for high M , is\nindeed veri\u001ced. These results for \u03c9p are obtained with\nt = 0.55 eV.\nThe steep drop in the resistivity below TC an be understood in a onsistent way: the resistivity is dominated\nby spin and phonon s attering at high temperatures until\nthe magneti transition is rea hed. Below this point the\nnegative mobility gap in reases along with M , delo alizing a onsiderable amount of the previously lo alized\nstates. The s aling theory of lo alization [35\u2104 pres ribes\nthat \u03c3(M ) \u223c (\u2212\u2206(M ))\u03bd . Repla ing here the results for\n\u2206(M ) of Fig. 1, we \u001cnd that \u03c1(TC )/\u03c1(T = 0) \u223c 20 \u0015 50,\nin agreement with the values obtained in the experiments\n[3, 4\u2104. The negative magnetoresistan e (MR) omes\nabout as a natural onsequen e of our mi ros opi me hanism and further supports our laim that the dependen e of the mobility gap on the magnetization is the\nmost relevant fa tor driving the physi s of this material\nnear TC .\nDoped EuB6 . Mean-\u001celd analysis of Hamiltonian (2)\npredi ts that TC s ales with hHi [36, 37\u2104. Sin e \u03c9p2 follows\nthe same s aling, as stated above, we expe t that in the\nseries Eu1\u2212x Cax B6 the squared plasma frequen y should\ns ale approximately with TC , a predi tion that would be\ninteresting to investigate experimentally with additional\ninfrared re\u001de tivity experiments.\nBand stru ture al ulations seem to agree that the ondu tion band has a strong 5d Eu omponent. Ca doping\nnot only dilutes the magneti system but also the ondu ting latti e. The hoping parameter e\nti,j in eq. (2) is\nthen repla ed by e\nti,j pi pj , where pi = 1 if the site i is o -\n\nupied by a Eu atom and pi = 0, otherwise. The mi ros opi problem thus be omes a DE problem in a per olating latti e whi h, at T = 0 K, redu es to a quantum perolation problem [38\u2104. Sin e Ca and Eu are isovalent in\nhexaborides one does not expe t the number of arriers to\ndepend on x. Nevertheless, sin e arriers are presumed to\narise from defe ts it is di\u001e ult to be spe i\u001c on this issue.\nThe mobility edge, on the other hand, is very sensitive\nto the Eu \u2192 Ca substitution, and should drift toward the\neC\nband enter. In the paramagneti regime (T > TC ), E\nshould move past the Fermi energy at some riti al doping xP\nMI , after whi h the mobility gap be omes positive.\nThis determines a rossover from the metalli regime to\nan insulating behavior for T > TC , as seen in the doped\nompounds [4, 6\u2104. At \u001cnite T the mobile arriers arise\nfrom thermal a tivation a ross the mobility gap. The resistivity should display a semi ondu ting behavior with\nT and its dependen e on M should be dominated by an\nexponential fa tor \u03c1(M ) \u223c exp(\u2206(M )/(kB T )) [39\u2104. Using \u2206(M ) \u2248 \u22060 (1 \u2212 \u03b1M ), as happens in the non-diluted\nase for either of the \u2206(M ) \u2276 0 situations, we \u001cnd that\n\u03c1(M ) \u223c exp(\u2212\u03b2M ) (\u03b2 is a onstant), as seen in the experiments [6\u2104.\n\nEu 1 \u2212 xCa x B6\n\nPM\n15\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\nTc(x)\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n0000000000000000000000000\n1111111111111111111111111\n\nT (K)\n\nPure diagonal, ne(M=0) = 0.007, t = 0.7 eV\n\nPI\n\nFI\n\nFM\n0\n\nx PMI\n\nx MI\n\nx c pc\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFigure 3: S hemati phase diagram for Eu1\u2212x Cax B6 in the\nT \u0015 x plane in standard notation: PM stands for paramagneti metal, PI for paramagneti insulator, FM means ferromagneti metal and FI ferromagneti insulator.\n\nAs T is lowered below TC and M in reases on the perolating luster, one expe ts the rossover from metalli to semi ondu ting behavior to o ur at larger values\nof x; this is illustrated in Fig. 3 by the urved dashed\nline separating the FM and FI regions. In the vi inity\nof this line, a sharp metal\u0015semi ondu ting distin tion is\nnot possible, resulting possibly in a bad\u0015metal behavior.\nAt T = 0, there is a metal\u0015insulator transition o urring at a on entration xMI \u2265 xP\nMI , whi h orresponds\nto the quantum per olation transition for a small number of arriers (this is di\u001berent from the usual quantum\nper olation point pQ < pc , whi h is de\u001cned by the lo-\n\n\f4\nalization of all states in the band [40\u2104). Even though\nwe expe t xMI to be lose to xP\nMI , the possibility of a\nsemi ondu ting behavior rossing over to metalli at low\nT (for some xP\nMI < x < xMI ) annot be ex luded. Ferromagnetism indu ed by the DE me hanism is expe ted\nto persist past xMI as long as the lo alization length is\ngreater than the latti e spa ing. Naturally, the riti al\non entration, xc , where TC \u2192 0, should not be higher\nthan pc \u2248 0.69, the lassi al site\u0015per olation threshold\nfor the simple ubi latti e [41\u2104. The values of xP\nMI and\nxMI in Fig. 3 vary with arrier density and are expe ted\nto be sample dependent, sin e arriers seem to originate\nfrom defe ts. In fa t, annealing experiments an be quite\nimportant for the study of the phase diagram.\nSome questions remain as yet unanswered. The value\nof t = 0.55 eV used in Fig.2 leads to a mean-\u001celd estimate\nof TC \u2248 80 K [37\u2104 whi h is mu h higher than the experimental value. At su h low arrier on entrations, magneti polaron formation [19, 42\u2104 must ertainly be taken\ninto a ount lose to TC and ould lead to a redu tion of\nthe mean-\u001celd estimate. Indeed, Raman s attering studies [43, 44\u2104 lose TC have been interpreted in terms of\nmagneti polarons. A large, positive, MR is observed at\nhigh \u001celds and T < TC in EuB6 [4, 14\u2104. If J > 0, it is possible that high magneti \u001celds may bring into play states\nof parallel ele troni and Eu spins, that were proje ted\nout to obtain the Hamiltonian (2). One would then have\nto deal with two types of arriers and therefore a positive\nMR. Finally, our model allows for the unusual situation\nof a ompetition between ondu tion by thermal a tivation a ross a small, magnetization dependent, mobility\ngap, and ondu tion by hopping among lo alized states.\nSome of the details of the transport properties, su h as\nthe remarkable s aling of the Hall oe\u001e ient with magnetization in Eu0.6 Ca0.4 B6 [6\u2104, will require a more thorough\nunderstanding of transport in these ir umstan es.\nIn on lusion, we have proposed a theory for Eu hexaborides, based on the lose proximity of the Fermi level\nand a magnetization dependent mobility edge EC (M ).\nThis theory arises quite naturally from the Kondo latti e\nproblem in the limit of very small number of arriers; it\na ounts, in a quantitative way, for many of the observed\nexperimental properties in these materials. Furthermore,\nwe also predi t a linear s aling of \u03c9p2 with TC that an\nbe tested in infrared re\u001de tivity experiments.\nWe thank L. Degiorgi, P. Littlewood, H. Ott, and\nC.
