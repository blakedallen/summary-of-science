INTRODUCTION\n\nTo extract useful work from random motion was a dream of mankind since the days when the Brownian motion was\nrecognized. Unfortunately, the second law of thermodynamics forbids to extract energy \"for free\" from equilibrium\nthermal fluctuations (white noise), which was didactically demonstrated by R. Feynman in his Lectures [1]. Nevertheless, one can extract useful work from non-equilibrium or time-correlated (colored) noise \"not paying\" for it, using\nso-called ratchets, i.e., systems with an asymmetric periodic potential [2]. Recently there was a boost of activity in\nthis field related to the experimental investigation of directed motion in biological systems, so-called Brownian motors\nwhich, e.g., move muscles or transport vesicles in a cell [3]. In the latter case the probable mechanism of operation is\nthe motion of kinesin molecules along the surface of microtubules, which can be mapped to the motion of Brownian\nparticles along a one-dimensional ratchet potential with the period 8.2 nm [4]. The non-equilibrium energy is supplied\nby chemical reaction of splitting of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which takes place close to the kinesin molecule.\nIn addition to the application of ratchets as noise rectifiers, it was suggested to use them for very efficient separation\nof small objects with different mobility, e.g., DNA molecules, viruses, etc. [5,6]. The particle separation is based on\nso-called deterministic ratchets [7], where the particles move in a certain direction under the action of a deterministic\nforce with zero time average. Moreover, changing the force profile one can reverse the direction of the particle motion\n[7]. The classification and discussion of different types of ratchet systems can be found in Ref. [8].\nIn this paper we focus on Josephson ratchets which are of particular interest because (a) the directed motion results\nin a dc voltage according to the Josephson relation and (b) these systems can operate at very high frequencies up\nto about 100 GHz. As a first example we mention the asymmetric dc SQUID where the equation of motion for the\nJosephson phase (difference of quantum mechanical phases) corresponds to the motion of an imaginary particle in a\n2D ratchet potential. Such SQUID ratchets have been proposed [9] and studied experimentally [10]. Another type\nof Josephson ratchet investigated recently is a 1D array of Josephson junctions with spatially modulated properties\n[11]. A Josephson kink (vortex), which can move along the array, can be considered as quasi-particle in a 1D ratchet\npotential.\nHere we propose a new class of Josephson ratchets which further develops the idea of a kink in a 1D array. The\nproposed system consists of a 1D long Josephson junction (LJJ) which may be bent in the ab-plane [see Fig. 1(a)] or\nhave variable width w(x). Here and below x is a curvelinear coordinate along the junction. The fluxon (Josephson\nvortex) moving along the junction, from a mathematical point of view, is a topological soliton. It has its own mass,\nvelocity, and other particle-like properties [12]. We study the motion of a fluxon in LJJs in a ratchet potential which\ncan be formed either by applying an external magnetic field and bending the junction properly or by modulating its\nwidth w(x). To provide the required periodicity of the potential, the junction is topologically closed in a loop. Such\na geometry is similar to the well known annular Josephson junction [13\u201317] in which a fluxon moves in a sinusoidal\npotential created by a magnetic field. Using a more elaborated shape [18] one can form an asymmetric potential with\nthe possibility to control its amplitude by changing the amplitude of the external magnetic field. An alternative idea\n1\n\n\fof magnetic field modulation using a specially shaped control line is proposed in Ref. [19]. The directional motion\nof a fluxon can be detected by measuring the dc voltage across the junction which is, due to the Josephson relation,\nproportional to the average velocity of a fluxon.\nBefore discussing fluxon dynamics in a ratchet potential we would like to stress the difference between conventional\nratchets and Josephson vortex ratchets. First, the fluxon, although it has a topological charge and in general behaves\nlike a particle, is a nonlinear wave, i.e., it can change its shape rather strongly as well as emit electromagnetic waves.\nSecond, the fluxon dynamics is usually studied in the underdamped limit which is opposite to the overdamped case\nwhich was considered for the majority of work on Brownian particles in a ratchet potential. Small damping may result\nin chaotic dynamics even in the deterministic case [20] and, in the case of the fluxon, even without any potential [21].\nThus, to have a well defined behavior of a fluxon ratchet, one has to work in the overdamped or in the weakly\nunderdamped limit. If one uses conventional Nb-AlOx -Nb technology to fabricate the LJJ, this requirement means\nthat the working temperature should be very close to Tc . As an alternative one can use junctions with intrinsically\nhigh damping such as SINIS LJJs [22] or high-Tc LJJs technology [23] which allows to fabricate LJJs of required\ntopology. Third, if we consider multi-particle dynamics, the strong repelling interaction between fluxons plays an\nimportant role and must be taken into account.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II we derive the equations for the dynamics of the Josephson phase\nin a bent LJJ of variable width w(x) in the external magnetic field. We also discuss different kinds of fluxon ratchets,\ntheir advantages and drawbacks. The numerical simulation results are presented in III. Section IV concludes this\nwork.\nII. THE MODEL\n\nHere we derive the generalized perturbed sine-Gordon equation which takes into account the curvature of the LJJ\n~ applied in the plane of the junction (in b direction) as\nin the ab-plane [see Fig. 1(a)], the uniform magnetic field H\nwell as the modulation of the LJJ width w(x) along its length x.\nWe start from a discrete representation of the LJJ shown schematically in Fig. 1(b). The Kirchhoff equations for\nthe Josephson phases in the cell and for the currents in one of the nodes are:\n\u03c6(x + dx) \u2212 \u03c6(x) =\n\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\u03a6(x) =\n[\u03a6e (x) \u2212 L(x)IL (x)] ;\n\u03a60\n\u03a60\nIL (x) \u2212 IL (x \u2212 dx) = Ie (x) \u2212 I(x),\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) is the Josephson phase at point x of the junction, \u03a6(x) and \u03a6e (x) are the total and the external magnetic\nflux applied to the cell, respectively, L(x) is the inductance of the piece of the junction electrodes between x and\nx + dx, IL (x) is the current in the electrodes, i.e. through the inductance L(x), Ie (x) is the externally applied bias\ncurrent, and I(x, t) is the current through the Josephson junction. The particular expression for I(x, t) depends on\nthe adopted JJ model and is introduced later.\nAssuming that the interval dx is infinitesimal, we can rewrite Eqs. (1) and (2) in a differential form using the\nfollowing expressions:\nI(x) = j(x)w(x)dx;\nIe (x) = je (x)w(x)dx;\n\u03bc0 d\u2032\nL(x) =\ndx;\nw(x)\n~ * ~n)\u039bdx = \u03bc0 H(x)\u039bdx,\n\u03a6e (x) = \u03bc0 (H\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03bc0 d\u2032 is the inductance of one square of the superconducting electrodes [24], d\u2032 \u2248 2\u03bbL is the effective magnetic\nn is the unit vector normal to the plane of the junction cell as shown in Fig. 1(b), \u039b \u2248 2\u03bbL\nthickness of the junction [24], ~\nis the effective penetration depth of the magnetic field into the junction [24], and \u03bbL is the London penetration depth\nof the superconducting electrode. We assume that the films are spatially uniform so that d\u2032 and \u039b are independent\non x.\nSubstituting Eqs. (3)\u2013(6) into Eqs. (1) and (2) we can rewrite the latter in a differential form as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u03bc0 d\u2032\n2\u03c0\n\u03bc0 H(x)\u039b \u2212\n=\nIL (x) ;\n(7)\n\u2202x\n\u03a60\nw(x)\n\u2202IL (x)\n= w(x) [je (x) \u2212 j(x)] .\n(8)\n\u2202x\n2\n\n\fExcluding IL (x) from Eqs. (7) and (8), we get the equation which describes the dynamics of the Josephson phase\nin the system:\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\n\u03a60\n1 d\nw(x) \u03bc0 \u039bH(x) \u2212\n(9)\n\u03c6x ,\nw(x) [je (x) \u2212 j(x)] =\n\u03bc0 d\u2032 dx\n2\u03c0\nHere and below, the subscripts t and x, if any, denote the derivatives with respect to time t and coordinate x,\nrespectively. Note, that we didn't include any particular model of JJ into our equation up to now, which is a definite\nadvantage of this derivation procedure. In the case of the simple RSJ model, one should substitute j(x) which is the\nsum of the supercurrent, normal (quasiparticle) current and displacement current densities:\nj(x) = jc sin(\u03c6) +\n\n\u03a60\n\u03a60\n\u03c6t + C \u03c6tt\n2\u03c0R\n2\u03c0\n\n(10)\n\ninto Eq. (9). Here jc , R and C are the critical current density, specific resistance and specific capacitance of the\njunction, accordingly. In this case Eq. (9) can be rewritten in a form which resembles the usual sine-Gordon equation\n[24]:\n\u0003\nwx (x) \u0002\nQH(x) \u2212 \u03bb2J \u03c6x ,\n(11)\nw(x)\np\np\nwhere \u03bbJ =\n\u03a60 /(2\u03c0\u03bc0 jc d\u2032 ) is the Josephson penetration depth, \u03c9p =\n2\u03c0jc /(\u03a60 C) is the Josephson plasma\nfrequency, \u03c9c = 2\u03c0jc R/\u03a60 is the so-called critical frequency, \u03b3(x) = je (x)/jc is a normalized bias current density, and\nQ = 2\u03c0\u03bc0 \u039b\u03bb2J /\u03a60 .\nFor theoretical investigation of the system we introduce standard normalized units, i.e., we normalize the coordinate\nto the Josephson penetration depth \u03bbJ , and the time to the inverse plasma frequency \u03c9p\u22121 . After such simplifications,\nEq. (11) can be rewritten as [25,26]:\n\u03bb2J \u03c6xx \u2212 \u03c9p\u22122 \u03c6tt \u2212 sin(\u03c6) = \u03c9c\u22121 \u03c6t \u2212 \u03b3(x) + QHx (x) +\n\n\u03c6xx \u2212 \u03c6tt \u2212 sin(\u03c6) = \u03b1\u03c6t \u2212 \u03b3(x) + hx (x) +\n\nwx (x)\n[h(x) \u2212 \u03c6x ] ,\nw(x)\n\n(12)\n\n\u221a\nwith the damping coefficient \u03b1 = \u03c9p /\u03c9c \u2261 1/ \u03b2c , and the field h normalized in a usual way as\nh(x) =\n\n2H(x)\n.\nHc1\n\n(13)\n\nHc1 = \u03a60 /(\u03c0\u03bc0 \u039b\u03bbJ ) is the first critical field (penetration field) for a LJJ which is, in fact, equal to the field in the\ncenter of the fluxon. The normalized velocity is given in natural units of c\u03040 = \u03bbJ \u03c9p , where c\u03040 is the so-called Swihart\nvelocity. The normalized voltage V = \u03c6t is given in units of \u03a60 \u03c9p /(2\u03c0). From now on all quantities are given in\nnormalized units.\nIn comparison with the usual perturbed sine-Gordon equation, Eq. (12) contains 3 additional terms. The term\nhx (x) describes the effect of the applied magnetic field when the junction is bent in the ab-plane. The second term\n[wx (x)/w(x)] \u03c6x comes from the width modulation. The last term [wx (x)/w(x)] h(x) describes the mixture of both\nand does appear only when both, field modulation due to curvature and width modulation are present.\nIt can be checked by a direct substitution into the Euler-Lagrange equation\nd \u2202L\nd \u2202L\n\u2202L\n+\n\u2212\n= 0,\ndt \u2202\u03c6t\ndx \u2202\u03c6x\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n(14)\n\nthat the Lagrangian density\nL = w(x)\n\n(\n\n)\n2\n[\u03c6x \u2212 h(x)]\n\u03c62t\n\u2212\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 cos \u03c6) ,\n2\n2\n\n(15)\n\nresults in the equation of motion (12) without the \u03b1\u03c6t and \u03b3 terms which describe dissipation and external force and\ntherefore are not included in the Lagrangian density. Of course, the Lagrangian density (15) can be obtained directly\nfrom Fig. 1(b) and the RSJ model. From Eq. (15) one can see that instead of the usual potential energy term \u03c62x /2 we\n2\nnow have w(x) [\u03c6x \u2212 h(x)] /2, i.e., actually 3 terms. The first, w(x)\u03c62x /2, is the obvious generalization of the usual\npotential energy term to the case of variable width w(x). The second term w(x)h(x)2 /2 is a constant term due to the\n3\n\n\fapplied field and is not related to the fluxon motion or other Josephson phase activity in the junction. In fact, there\nare no traces of this term in Eq. (12). The third term h(x)\u03c6x w(x) represents the part of the potential energy density\nwhich we are interested in and which we are going to exploit to build a system with a ratchet potential.\nOne of the solutions of the sine-Gordon Eq. (12) with zero r.h.s. is a soliton (fluxon)\n\u03c6(x, x0 ) = 4 arctan exp(x \u2212 x0 ),\n\n(16)\n\nwith the center situated at point x0 . We consider non-relativistic motion i.e., dx0 /dt \u226a 1. Further assuming that the\nfluxon profile (16) does not change much due to the r.h.s. of Eq. (12) which acts as a perturbation, we can get the\nexplicit expression for the potential energy U (x0 ) as a function of fluxon coordinate x0 . For this purpose, we note\nthat in expression (15) for the Lagrangian density the second and the third terms correspond to the potential energy\ndensity U(x, x0 ) (with opposite sign). The potential energy U (x0 ) is obtained by substituting \u03c6(x, x0 ) from Eq. (16)\ninto U(x, x0 ) and integrating over x. Thus, we get\nZ +\u221e\n2w(x)h(x)\n4w(x)\n\u2212\nU (x0 ) =\ndx.\n(17)\n2\ncosh(x \u2212 x0 )\n\u2212\u221e cosh (x \u2212 x0 )\nThe first term corresponds to the potential energy due to width modulation, the second due to shape, field and width.\nThe first possibility to form a ratchet potential is to apply no magnetic field (h = 0) and to vary the width w(x)\nof the junction. In this case the potential energy will be given by the first term of Eq. (17). Moreover, when the\njunction width w(x) does not change much over the distance comparable with the fluxon size, the potential\nU (x0 ) \u2248 8w(x0 )\n\n(18)\n\njust repeats the w(x0 ) profile. From Eq. (18) it follows that if the width changes as a saw-tooth, so does the potential\nenergy, except for the vicinity of the saw-tooth's infinite slope where one has to calculate the convolution according\nto Eq. (17). Here and below when mentioning saw-tooth profile we mean a saw-tooth with finite positive slope and\ninfinite negative slope. In the case of the saw-tooth where the width changes from w0 to w0 + \u2206w at the point x0 = 0\n(infinite slope), the potential energy in the vicinity of the point x0 = 0 is U (x0 ) = 8w0 + 4\u2206w [1 + tanh(x0 )]. The\npractical implementation of such a ratchet would look like an annular LJJ with the outer edge having the shape of a\ncircle and inner edge having the shape of one turn of a spiral. This geometry has the advantage that the corresponding\npotential can be made ideally saw-tooth-like except for the smearing due to the convolution in Eq. (17), which is a\ncommon feature of all fluxon based systems. In some sense, this system is an analog of the Josephson ratchets based\non 1D arrays [11]. Unfortunately both types of ratchets do not allow to control the potential height during experiment\nwhich can be considered as a disadvantage.\nThe second possibility is to keep w constant, to apply a magnetic field and to bend the junction in the ab-plane.\nIn this case the first term of Eq. (17) gives a constant and we have to consider only the second term. Again, if h(x)\nchanges slowly in comparison with the fluxon size, Eq. (17) is simplified to\nU (x0 ) = \u22122\u03c0wh(x0 ).\n\n(19)\n\n~\nIn the well known case of the ring shaped junction, the field h(x) = h0 cos(\u03b8) = h0 cos(x/R) [\u03b8 is the angle between H\nand ~n, as shown in Fig. 1], and therefore we get a symmetric potential. If we deform the ring properly, the potential\ncan be made asymmetric as desired. Possible experimental shapes are shown in Fig. 2. The advantage of this kind\nof ratchets is that one can control the amplitude of the potential during experiment by varying the amplitude h0 of\nthe magnetic field. The possibility to tune the potential height allows to implement so-called flashing ratchets [8] by\n~ of\napplying either an ac magnetic field using a coil or just placing an rf antenna close to the junction so that the H\nthe emitted electromagnetic wave will have non-zero component in the ab-plane.\nNote, that the terms \u03b3(x) and hx (x) in Eq. (12) from a mathematical point of view play the same role. Therefore\nin the experiment the field h(x) can be substituted by a properly chosen additional bias current \u03b3p (x) = \u2212hx (x),\nwhich has zero average in space. The inverse mapping is also valid, but the bias current with non-zero average maps\nto a non-periodic field (potential) with linearly growing component, which does not belong to the class of ratchets.\nIn section III.A we, in fact, use h\u03b3i =\n6 0 (these brackets denote spacial averaging), but only to test the asymmetry of\nthe potential. When we demonstrate the real operation of the ratchet in the section III.B, we have h\u03b3i = 0.\nIII. SIMULATION RESULTS\n\nIn this section we study the fluxon dynamics in a Josephson ratchet of the second type (h 6= 0, w = const) for a\nsaw-tooth field profile h(x). This ideal asymmetric profile is not only of academic interest because it should show\n4\n\n\fthe best figures of merit for fluxon ratchets but also can be quite closely reproduced in a real system [see shape in\nFig. 2(b) and corresponding h(x) in Fig. 3(a)]. All simulations were performed using an explicit numerical scheme for\nEq. (12) using a LJJ of the normalized length l = 20, with damping coefficient \u03b1 = 0.2 (weakly underdamped limit).\nThe numerical technique and simulation software are discussed in detail elsewhere [27].\nA. Probing the asymmetry of the potential\n\nFirst, we probe the asymmetry of the potential by calculating critical current \u03b3c vs. potential height h0 for the\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\ncase of one trapped fluxon [\u03b3c1\n(h0 )] and for the case of no trapped fluxons [\u03b3c0\n(h0 )]. The superscripts '+' or '\u2212'\ncorrespond to opposite directions of applied bias current.\nOn the basis of the model derived in the previous section we can understand how these dependences should look\nlike for arbitrary magnetic field profile h(x). In general, due to the loop-like geometry, the left and right tails of a\nfluxon can interact. We assume that the junction is long enough and this interaction in negligible. This situation\nis equivalent to the long periodic system where the fluxons are separated by a large distance l \u226b \u03bbJ . Furthermore,\nwe represent the field h(x) as h0 H(x) and map it to the equivalent additional bias current \u03b3p (x) = \u2212h0 Hx (x). An\nexample of h(x) and \u03b3p (x) derived from the geometry in Fig. 2(b) is shown in Fig. 3(a).\nIf there is a fluxon in the junction, \u03b3(x) and \u03b3p (x) translate into a driving force F\u03b3 (x0 ) and a potential (pinning)\nforce Fp (x0 ), respectively, acting on the fluxon [28]\nZ\n\nF\u03b3 (x0 ) =\n\n+\u221e\n\n2\u03b3(x)w\ndx = 2\u03c0\u03b3w,\ncosh(x \u2212 x0 )\n\n(20)\n\n2\u03b3p (x)w\ndx = h0 f (x0 )w.\ncosh(x \u2212 x0 )\n\n(21)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nFp (x0 ) =\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nThe corresponding potential U (x0 ) and force f (x0 ) are shown in Fig. 3(b). For the sake of simplicity we suppose that\n\u03b3 does not depend on x, but our discussion can be easily generalized to the case when the r.h.s. of Eq. (20) is equal to\n2\u03c0\u0393(x0 )w. The pinning force (21) can be also obtained directly from expression (17) for the potential energy. When\nwe increase \u03b3 the fluxon is pinned while these two forces can compensate each other, i.e., F\u03b3 (x0 ) + Fp (x0 ) = 0. The\ndepinning happens for\n\u03b3 = \u03b3c1 = \u2212h0 f (x1 )/2\u03c0,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere x1 is the coordinate at which f (x1 ) has a minimum [see Fig. 3(b)]. We assume that \u03b3 > 0 and f (x1 ) < 0. Thus\nfrom Eq. (22) we see that \u03b3c1 (h0 ) looks like a straight line which starts from the origin.\nOn the other hand, regardless of the presence of a fluxon, the Josephson phase evolves under the action of the\nnet current \u03b3 + \u03b3p . From Fig. 3(a) it is clear that at point x2 , where \u03b3p (x) is maximum, this sum can exceed 1\nfor some value of \u03b3 = \u03b3c and the junction switches to the resistive state. Using the \u03b3p = \u2212h0 Hx (x) the condition\n\u03b3c + \u03b3p (x2 ) = 1 gives\n\u03b3c (h0 ) = 1 + h0 Hx (x2 ) = 1 \u2212 h0 |Hx (x2 )| ,\n\n(23)\n\ni.e., also a straight line, but with the negative slope.\nSummarizing, \u03b3c1 (h0 ) has two branches (22) and (23), and follows the one with the lowest critical current for given\nh0 . For fields 0 < h0 < h\u2217 , \u03b3c1 (h0 ) is given by Eq. (22), and for h0 > h\u2217 by Eq. (23), where the field\nh\u2217 =\n\n\u22121\n,\nf (x1 )/2\u03c0 + Hx (x2 )\n\n(24)\n\nis the field where these two dependences intersect. The dependence \u03b3c0 (h0 ) has only one branch (23) since the fluxon\ndepinning mechanism is absent.\nWhen one applies the current \u03b3 in the opposite direction, the dependences qualitatively look the same but the\nparticular values of slopes can be different in the case of an asymmetric potential, if \u03b3p (x2 ) 6= \u2212\u03b3p (x4 ) and f (x1 ) 6=\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u2212f (x3 ) (see Fig. 3). Thus, the measurement of \u03b3c0\n(h0 ) and \u03b3c1\n(h0 ) gives direct information about the asymmetry of\nthe field and of the potential, respectively. Note that an asymmetric potential may have \u03b3p (x2 ) = \u2212\u03b3p (x4 ) and/or\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nf (x1 ) = \u2212f (x3 ), i.e., it does not reveal its asymmetry in the measurements of \u03b3c0\n(h0 ) and \u03b3c1\n(h0 ). Inversely, the\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nasymmetry of \u03b3c0 (h0 ) and \u03b3c1 (h0 ) is a clear indication of asymmetry in the system.\n5\n\n\f\u00b1\n\u00b1\nWe stress that the first branch of \u03b3c0\n(h0 ) and the second branch of \u03b3c1\n(h0 ) show the asymmetry of the field h(x),\n\u00b1\nwhile the first branch of \u03b3c1 (h0 ) shows the asymmetry of potential U (x0 ), i.e., already after convolution (17) with \u03c6x .\nWhile hx (x0 ) may have appreciable asymmetry, U (x0 ) may be almost symmetric.\nWe should note that the above analysis is valid for an arbitrary field profile h(x) as long as hx (x) can be considered\nas a perturbation in the r.h.s. of Eq. (12). However, for the case of the saw-tooth potential this is not the case,\nsince hx (x) has a \u03b4(x)-like behavior at the point of the junction where the saw-tooth has infinite slope. Therefore our\nanalysis is valid only qualitatively. In particular the dependences \u03b3c\u00b1 (h0 ) still have linear slopes but the values of the\nslopes can not be calculated using simple integrals as shown above because the fluxon shape will differ from (16) quite\nconsiderably, as we saw in numerical simulations. Therefore we present the results of direct numerical simulation of\nEq. (12).\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nThe simulated \u03b3c0\n(h0 ) and \u03b3c1\n(h0 ) for an ideal saw-tooth field profile h(x) are presented in Fig. 4. The magnetic\nfield is given in terms of the force amplitude h0 2\u03c0/l. If the system is closed in a loop with a normalized circumference\nl, the h(x) can be written in the form h0 H(2\u03c0x/l) where H is geometry dependent 2\u03c0 periodic function normalized\nto 1. Therefore the term hx (x) in Eq. (12) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nhx (x) = h0 H\u2032\nx ,\n(25)\nl\nl\n\nwhere H\u2032 (\u03be) = dH(\u03be)/d\u03be is a periodic function. This means that the potential force scales inversely proportional to\nthe length of the junction l. So, to get rid of the length dependence and make our results valid for any length l \u226b 1,\nwe present our results as a function of h0 2\u03c0/l.\nFrom Fig. 4 one can see that the depinning current \u03b3c1 (0) = 0 and then grows linearly with field, as expected from\nthe theory, up to some field h\u2217 2\u03c0/l \u2248 1.8. After that it decreases linearly with field, also according to our prediction,\nand, finally, exhibits multiple branches corresponding to the multi-fluxon states.\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nAs it should be in the case of a saw-tooth potential, the slopes of \u03b3c0\n(h0 ) and \u03b3c1\n(h0 ) are not symmetric, and the\nratio of the slopes is about 4. Ideally, if the fluxon were a real particle we could expect an infinite force necessary\nto push the fluxon out of the well in the direction against the infinite slope and, therefore, an infinite ratio of slopes\n\u00b1\non \u03b3c1\n(h0 ) curves. In practice, due to the convolution (17), we have a finite force and a finite ratio of slopes on the\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u03b3c1 (h0 ) dependences. The finite ratio of slopes on \u03b3c0\n(h0 ) as well as of the second slopes \u03b3c1\n(h0 > h\u2217 ) is observed\nbecause perturbation theory does not apply as mentioned above.\nThe next step is the understanding of the dynamics of the fluxon in an asymmetric potential. One of the simplest\nobservations which can be made numerically as well as experimentally is the examination of the fluxon trapping current\n\u03b3tr , i.e., the minimum current at which a fluxon still moves along the system, not being trapped by the potential.\nObviously, in the underdamped system the trapping of the fluxon by the potential will not take place while the kinetic\nenergy of the fluxon exceeds the height of the potential, and one should not see any difference in the fluxon trapping\n\u00b1\ncurrents \u03b3tr\n(h0 ) for opposite bias current directions. In the strongly overdamped case the fluxon dissipates energy so\nfast that to move further under the action of the driving force, the driving force should always overcome the maximum\nvalue of the potential (trapping) force. In an asymmetric potential the maximum force created by the potential is\ndifferent for opposite directions of fluxon motion and we should expect a difference in the fluxon trapping current.\n\u00b1\nThe simulated \u03b3tr\n(h0 ) curves for a saw-tooth potential are shown in Fig. 5. Even in the slightly underdamped case\n\u03b1 = 0.2 the dependences for positive and negative direction of fluxon motion (bias current) differ quite considerably.\n+\n+\nWe also note that \u03b3tr\n(h0 ) almost coincides with \u03b3c1\n(h0 ) (see Fig. 4) for h0 < 2 which means that for positive direction\nof bias there is no hysteresis on the I\u2013V characteristic when the system switches from zero voltage state to the state\nwith moving fluxon and back. Instead, for the negative bias the hysteresis is present as can be seen in Fig. 6.\nB. Motion due to monochromatic force\n\nIn the following we investigate the motion of a fluxon in a system with the saw-tooth field profile h(x) and w = const\nunder the action of a monochromatic ac bias current \u03b3 = \u03b3ac sin(\u03c9t) in Eq. (12). If as a result of an ac drive the\nfluxon starts to move around the junction, we can estimate the characteristic frequency of this process. It is clear that\nthe maximum velocity of the fluxon is equal to the Swihart velocity (1 in normalized units) therefore the maximum\nrevolution frequency is \u03c9max = 2\u03c0/l \u2248 0.314.\nIn the limit of low frequency (quasi-static) drive \u03c9 \u226a \u03c9max we can calculate the net average velocity of the fluxon,\njust integrating the current-velocity characteristics u(\u03b3) (see Fig. 6) at a given value of field h0 as:\nu(\u03b3ac ) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n2\u03c0\n\nu(\u03b3ac sin(\u03c4 )) d\u03c4,\n\n0\n\n6\n\n(26)\n\n\fwhere the integration path should follow the proper hysteretic branches of the u(\u03b3) dependence.\nIn the case when \u03c9 is comparable with the maximum frequency of the fluxon rotation around the junction \u03c9max ,\nwe perform direct numerical simulations. The dependences u(\u03b3ac ) calculated numerically for different values of \u03c9 are\nshown in Fig. 7(a)\u2013(c) for h0 2\u03c0/l = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0, respectively. The upper curves marked as \"qs\" (quasi-static) are\ncalculated using Eq. (26). All other curves for \u03c9 = 0.01\u20130.1 were obtained by means of direct numerical simulation\nof Eq. (12). Such values of frequencies were chosen taking into account that they should be less but comparable with\n\u03c9max . As we saw in simulations, at \u03c9 \u2265 0.2 [in the case of Fig. 7(a) already for \u03c9 = 0.1] the rectification is suppressed\nalmost completely.\nFrom Fig. 7 one can see that the dependence u(\u03b3ac ) for quasi-static case is piecewise with jumps at the values of\nbias current where switching between different hysteretic branches occurs. For example, let us focus on h0 2\u03c0/l = 1.0\n[see Fig. 7(b)]. In this case the switch between different hysteretic branches occurs at \u03b3 which is equal to 0.522, 0.696,\n0.916 (c.f. Figs. 4, 6 and 7). Several characteristic regions can be distinguished. First, in the region of small values of\n\u03b3ac , where u = 0, the amplitude of the ac current is not big enough to exceed the pinning current and the fluxon is\nlocalized in the well. At higher ac bias up to \u03b3ac = 0.522 the positive depinning current is exceeded and the system\nswitches to the fluxon step, i.e., the fluxon escapes from the well and starts to move around the junction. Note that\nduring a period of ac drive the fluxon can only make integer number of turns and at the end of the period will be\nagain localized in the well. This results in the quantization of the average velocity u, as can be seen as steps on all\ncurves except for the quasi-static one. The step number corresponds to the number of turns done by the fluxon during\none period of ac drive. The voltage rectifier based on this principle will give a quantized voltage Vn = n\u03a60 \u03c9/2\u03c0\n(in physical units) which is defined by fundamental constants and the applied frequency. The corresponding velocity\nquanta in Fig. 7 are given by un = n\u03c9l/(2\u03c0). This gives u1 \u2248 0.0318 for l = 20 and \u03c9 = 0.01. Note that the voltage\nquantum increases with \u03c9 and for \u03c9 = 0.01 five quanta (turns per ac cycle) give the same voltage as one quantum for\n\u03c9 = 0.05. For the quasi-static case the voltage quantum is infinitesimal so that the quasi-static curves look smooth.\nA further increase of the ac bias amplitude 0.522 < \u03b3ac < 0.696 results in a decrease of the dc voltage because\nduring the negative semi-period of the ac drive the fluxon starts moving in the opposite direction so that the efficiency\nof the fluxon ratchet drops.\nThe big peak at 0.696 < \u03b3ac < 0.916 in Fig. 7(b) is related to the switching of the junction to the resistive state\nduring the positive semi-period while during the negative semi-period the junction stays in the zero-voltage state or\non the fluxon step. When the amplitude of ac drive gets big enough to switch the system to the resistive state also\nduring negative semi-periods, the dc voltage drops again and in the limit of very strong ac drive approaches zero. A\nlarge amplitude of ac bias \u03b3ac \u226b 1 implies that the system spends almost the whole period in the positive or negative\nresistive state and only a tiny fraction of the period on the asymmetric part of the current-velocity characteristic at\nlow currents, so that the resulting average velocity is close to zero. In addition, such a strong ac drive results in\nchaotic dynamics, as can be seen in Fig. 7 for large values of \u03b3ac .\nFigure 7 also shows that the rectification effect decreases when the driving frequency increases and approaches the\nmaximum fluxon rotation frequency \u03c9max .\nWe point out that the performance of the fluxon rectifier depends on the chosen potential amplitude h0 . For\ncomparison in Fig. 7(a)\u2013(c) we show the rectification characteristics for different values of magnetic field amplitude\n2\u03c0h0 /l = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 (see Fig. 4). We see that the potential depth affects the amplitude of ac drive at which\nrectification appears, at which u(\u03b3ac ) has maximum and it affects the relative location of the two regions corresponding\nto the fluxon rectification regime and resistive rectification regime. We note, that the resistive rectification regime in\nprinciple gives a larger effect which is inversely proportional to the damping coefficient \u03b1, i.e., it can be made rather\nbig. However, this is a rather trivial effect which can be obtained using any non-symmetric I\u2013V curve. The fluxon\nrectification regime, which is the main subject of this study, gives smaller but a quantized voltages. This can be an\nadvantage for some applications.\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe proposed a new type of Josephson vortex ratchets, where the motion of a fluxon along a long Josephson junction\nclosed in a loop can be considered as the motion of a quasi-particle in a ratchet potential. The derived model suggests\nseveral implementations of the fluxon ratchets, and, in particular, the one where the amplitude of the potential\ncan be controlled during experiment. Since the fluxon is a soliton (non-linear wave) moving in the underdamped\nmedium with asymmetric potential, we expect some non-trivial effects related to (a) wave properties of the fluxon,\n(b) underdamped dynamics and (c) interaction between fluxons. As a first step, we performed a numerical analysis\nof the effective potential seen by a fluxon, and checked the rectification of a monochromatic signal. We found that\na fluxon rectifier produces a quantized voltage, with a quantum given (due to the Josephson relation) only by the\n\n7\n\n\ffundamental constant \u03a60 and the driving frequency \u03c9. The experimental investigation of the proposed system based\non (Nb-Al-AlOx )-Nb Josephson junction technology is in progress.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank P. Caputo, A. Ustinov, M. Fistul and B.
