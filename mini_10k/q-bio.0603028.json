Inherent to the indispensability of\nproteins for living cells is the fact that a given protein can adopt a specific threedimensional shape that is specified solely by the protein's sequence of amino acids. Over\nthe past several decades, structural biologists have demonstrated that the array of\nstructures that proteins may adopt is quite astounding, and this has lead to a strong\ninterest in understanding how protein structures change and evolve over time. In this\nreview we consider a large body of recent work that attempts to illuminate this structurecentric picture of protein evolution. Much of this work has focused on the question of\nhow completely new protein structures (i.e. new folds or topologies) are discovered by\nprotein sequences as they evolve. Pursuant to this question of structural innovation has\nbeen a desire to describe and understand the observation that certain types of protein\nstructures are far more abundant than others and how this uneven distribution of proteins\nimplicates on the process through which new shapes are discovered. We consider a\nnumber of theoretical models that have been successful at explaining this heterogeneity in\nprotein populations and discuss the increasing amount of evidence that indicates that the\nprocess of structural evolution involves the divergence of protein sequences and\nstructures from one another. We also consider the topic of protein designability, which\nconcerns itself with understanding how a protein's structure influences the number of\nsequences that can successfully fold into that structure. Understanding and quantifying\nthe relationship between the physical feature of a structure and its designability has been\na long-standing goal of the study of protein structure and evolution, and we discuss a\nnumber of recent advances that have yielded a promising answer to this question. Finally\nwe review the relatively new field of protein structural phylogeny, an area of study in\nwhich information about the distribution of protein structures among different organisms\nis used to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between them. Taken together, the\nwork that we review presents an increasingly coherent picture of how these unique\npolymers have evolved over the course of life on Earth.\n\n2\n\n\fIntroduction\nUnderstanding the evolution of proteins represents an important task in the study of\nmolecular evolution. Proteins play a central role in almost every process in the cell, and\nit is clear that life as we know it could not exist without this functionally diverse class of\nmacromolecules. The great functional capacity and importance of proteins largely stems\nfrom the remarkable ability of these polymers to adopt distinct 3-dimensional structures.\nAs Anfinsen's experiment first demonstrated (1), protein structures are for the most part\nspecified by their amino acid sequences, and the variety of protein structures that may be\nachieved by varying these sequences in a 20-letter alphabet is truly astounding (2-6). The\nstrong correspondence between protein structure and function indicates that any attempt\nto understand how life has evolved to its present-day form must explain the changes in\nprotein sequence and structure that have occurred over the past ~3.5 billion years.\nThe structure-centric view of protein evolution seeks, at its core, to understand the\nprocess whereby novel protein structures and folds are discovered (6). Although such\ndiscovery events are likely to be comparatively rare, they are of obvious and extreme\nimportance to living organisms. New sequence-structure pairs can substantially vary\nenzymatic, regulatory and mechanical functions that may be achieved by proteins;\nentirely new folds and topologies can provide completely new chemistry and biology to a\ncell. The observation of structural diversity in the natural world is clear evidence that\nsuch structural innovation events have occurred over the course of evolution, and much\nwork has been done to understand how this process occurs. As databases of sequence\nand structure information have grown in size it has become possible to understand\nstructural diversity in a systematic way, posit models describing the progress of structural\n\n3\n\n\fevolution, and test those models against quantitative features of the existing protein\nuniverse. Our analysis of this work begins with an overview of the various approaches to\nencoding and quantifying structural diversity and structural relationships, from earlier\nhuman-annotated databases of structural taxonomy to the more recent use of quantitative\nstructural comparisons to build graph theoretic descriptions of the protein universe.\nThese various representations are informed by, and in turn inform, the long-standing\ndebate between two diametrically opposed paradigms for protein evolution: convergence\nand divergence. We review the current status of this debate and also look in detail at the\nperformance of a wide variety of divergent models that have been put forth within the last\n10 years to explain structural innovation.\nAlthough the mechanism by which sequences discover new types of protein\nstructure is inherently interesting and important, the structure-centric view also looks to\nelucidate the design principles that underlie the correspondence between sequence,\nstructure and function. To what extent do protein structures constrain the sequences that\ncan fold into them? How does the level of constraint and the number of possible\nsequences vary from structure to structure? How functionally flexible are different\nstructures? What signatures of these varying structural influences can be found in either\nstructures or sequences? As the amount of available data has grown, answers to these\nfundamental questions are beginning to appear. In this chapter we review the long\nhistory of the \"designability\" principle, which is the idea that some structures inherently\ncorrespond to more sequences than others. Although this concept was first expressed in\nterms of the convergent paradigm of structural evolution, we explore the current view\nthat designability may actually have a large impact on the nature of evolution even within\n\n4\n\n\fa divergent paradigm. We also consider the various methods that have been proposed to\nquantify how designable a structure should be based solely on its physical features. We\nlook at the implications that designability may have for the sizes of existing protein\nfamilies, their thermodynamic stability, and their ability to perform diverse chemical and\nbiological functions.\nFinally, the structure-centric view seeks to understand the natural history of\nprotein domains and build a comprehensive picture of both structural and organismal\nevolution. Questions of phylogeny have long been the domain of sequence analysis, but\nrecent work has demonstrated that protein structures have a lot to tell us about the\nevolution of living systems beyond simple questions of their own evolution. Although\nthis particular field is still very much in its infancy, we review the recent efforts that have\nattempted to parlay the burgeoning availability of structural information into\nimprovements in phylogenetic understanding.\n\nUnderstanding the Protein Structural Universe\nStructural Classification\nAs mentioned above, the set of protein structures that populate modern databases exhibits\nan amazing level of diversity (2-7). It is in many ways instructive to think of this\ndiversity as the protein analogue of the diversity of forms (or \"structures\") we observe for\norganisms in the natural world. In both cases the array of structures is at once intriguing\nand bewildering (the CATH wheel displayed in Figure 1, first introduced by Thornton\nand co-workers (5), captures this structural diversity quite nicely). Despite this diversity,\ncareful analysis of organismal structures leads to the realization that there seem to be\norganizing principles and systematic relationships that govern the progression of shapes.\n\n5\n\n\fFigure 1\n\nFigure 1. The CATH wheel, taken from (4). The diversity of 3-D shapes observed in the set of solved\nprotein structures is exemplified by the structures surrounding the wheel; secondary structural content runs\nfrom all-\u03b1 to \u03b1/\u03b2 and, even within classes of secondary structural content, a wide variety of structures are\nobserved. The sizes of the pie slices in the wheel essentially reflect the number of domains that display a\nparticular architecture (i.e. TIM Barrel or IG-like).\n\nFor instance, it is clear that the different species of beetles, for all of their diversity, are\nmore closely related to one another than they are to other insects; that is, organisms have\ncertain structural characteristics that seem to define a set of hierarchical categories to\nwhich they naturally belong. In analogy to this taxonomy of organisms, early analysis of\nprotein structural databases revealed that there were systematic variations in protein\nstructure in which concepts of \"homology\" in sequence and structure make sense (3, 5, 6,\n\n6\n\n\f8). This work led to the critical idea that proteins could be categorized with respect to\none another on the basis of their degree of similarity in sequence- and structure-based\ncharacteristics. This allows for the existing protein structural universe to be analyzed in\nsystematic ways and is crucial for understanding how protein sequences and structures\nevolve (6).\nDatabases of structural classification are familiar to most protein scientists.\nPerhaps the most well known are SCOP (Structural Classification of Proteins) developed\nby Murzin and colleagues(3), CATH (Class Architecture Topology Homology) by\nThornton and colleagues (7) and FSSP (Families of Structurally Similar Proteins) by\nHolm, Sander and colleagues (9). The two former databases (SCOP and CATH) are\norganized around similar taxonomic principles and involve some measure of human\ncuration (much as taxonomy often relies on human judgments of similarity). FSSP is a\nfully computational and automated form of structural classification aimed at similar\ntaxonomic goals (9, 10).\nThe basic unit of structural taxonomy (i.e. the \"species\" that are classified with\nrespect to one another) is the protein domain. A domain is defined as an independently\nfolding structural unit (6), and every protein structure consists of at least one structural\ndomain. The fact that such domains are considered stable and foldable on their own\nindicates that they may represent convenient, independent evolutionary units and\nprovides an appropriate set of species from which the taxonomy may be built. Although\nthe definition of these domains is a non-trivial problem (3, 6, 8), these structures are well\naccepted as the most appropriate and basic unit in protein classification.\n\n7\n\n\fDomains from different proteins are grouped together in the first (several) levels\nof classification on the basis of sequence similarity. Although all protein classification\nsystems are inherently structural in nature, the fact that sequence homologs are also close\nstructural homologs informs these levels of classification (3, 5-7, 11). Sequence\nhomologs are certainly very closely related in evolutionary terms, and it is clear that\northologs and paralogs of a given domain share a common sequence ancestor. These sets\nof similar sequences are grouped together as a domain family in the hierarchical\nclassification (3, 6, 9). The next level of classification is that of a \"fold,\" which\nrepresents a cluster of domain families that exhibit similar structures. At the fold level\nthere is ostensibly little or no sequence similarity between members of the different\nsequence families that make up the fold, that is, different members of a fold exhibit\nstructural similarity in the absence of sequence similarity.\nGiven the large amount of work that has been done to understand the statistical\nand evolutionary meaning of sequence overlap (3, 5, 6, 12, 13), classification of\nsequences into domain families is fairly straightforward. Classification of those\nstructures into folds is not so simple. In the case of both SCOP and CATH, these\nclassifications have at least some human component; for instance the SCOP database\nstructural classifications rely heavily on the structural intuition of Murzin himself (3, 6,\n7). Such intuitive structural classifications are not necessarily problematic; indeed, they\nrepresent a very appealing scheme since the very intuition for structural similarity that\nsuggested the existence and evolutionary utility of a structural taxonomy is employed to\ndefine it. Human classification does, however, introduce problems if one wishes to\nreliably quantify the structural relationships between domains. It is clear that all pairwise\n\n8\n\n\frelationships between (family) domain structures at the fold level are not equivalent;\nsome TIM barrel families look more similar to each other than other TIM barrel families.\nTo overcome this difficulty, Holm and Sander introduced a completely automated\nmethod for defining structural distances (10), defining protein domains (8) and\nclassifying them with respect to one another (9). The structural comparison algorithm\nthey employ, DALI, is based on measuring the similarity between the inter-residue\ndistance matrices (i.e. contact maps) that characterize two different structures (10).\nStructural similarity is quantified as the DALI Z-score, which represents the statistical\nsignificance of a structural overlap. The FSSP database classifies structures into a level\nequivalent to the \"fold\" using DALI in a completely automatic way (9). Given the fact\nthat DALI produces structural similarity scores commensurate with our expectations for\nstructural similarity, it is not surprising to find that the correspondence between SCOP,\nCATH and FSSP classification assignments is fairly high (14, 15). Although higher\nlevels of structural taxonomy exist (i.e. structural class such as \u03b1/\u03b2), for the purposes of\nunderstanding the nature of the protein structural universe the fold component of the\nhierarchy has provided perhaps the most insight.\nDistribution of Folds and the Convergent/Divergent Debate\nThe classification schemes discussed above, regardless of their reliance on human\nor computational structural homology measurements, provide very similar results in\nterms of the distribution of protein structures within protein structural space. Some\nprotein folds contain many, many more members than other folds (see, for instance, the\ndifferences in the sizes of the \"pie slices\" in the CATH wheel in Figure 1)(5, 6). For\ninstance the number of domains that are classified in the TIM barrel fold is much larger\n\n9\n\n\fthan the number classified in the Phosphoglycerate Kinase fold (3). Explaining the\nsource of this heterogeneity has been the subject of much study and has lead to the\nproposal of two opposing views of protein structural evolution: convergence and\ndivergence.\nPerhaps the earliest proposal aimed at explaining the heterogeneity in fold and\nfamily sizes was the idea of designability. This concept, attributed to Finklestein and\ncolleagues (16-18), proposes that some protein structures can be coded for by many\ndistinct sequences and are thus more designable than those structures that can be coded\nfor by comparatively few sequences. Although the idea of designability is in no way\nincompatible with either convergent or divergent pictures of protein evolution, the\nconvergent argument relies heavily on it to describe the empirical differences in fold\nsizes (6, 16, 17). The argument runs like this: suppose that the total number of possible\npolypeptide structures (i.e. the set of all possible folds) is fairly small. Two domain\nsequences evolving independently of one another discover these different folds at\nrandom, and the proportion of times a given fold is discovered is related quite naturally to\nthe designability of that fold. Under this hypothesis the observation that two domain\nfamilies share significant topological and structural features (and as such are classified\ntogether in one fold) indicates that the two sequences converged to the same moderately\nor highly designable structure.\nAs more and more structural information became available and it became possible\nto start quantifying the amount of heterogeneity in fold sizes, an alternative divergent\npicture of protein evolution emerged (6). This picture holds that the number of protein\nsequence families and protein structural folds is large and the structures we observe today\n\n10\n\n\fare the result of evolutionary dynamics and not some inherent feature of the fold. This\nparadigm of structural evolution posits that members of a given fold share a common\nancestor that exhibited the topological features that define the fold. In this paradigm,\npairwise structural similarity in the absence of sequence similarity is in fact an indicator\nof ancient sequence homology, and all members of a fold derive from a single common\nancestor (6). Both the divergent and convergent paradigms have their adherents, but in\nrecent years the divergent picture has gained considerably in popularity(6). At this point\nwe will consider the arguments that characterize both sides and then proceed to review\nthe salient features of the protein structural universe that have been used to support each\nclaim.\nUntil recently the most common arguments against the convergent picture\nrevolved around the fact that the assumptions underlying it simply do not make sense(6).\nThe size of sequence space is massive (on the order of 10130 or more sequences\ndepending on the sequence length), and so it is clear that the extent of sequence\nexploration represented by currently existing domains is a very tiny fraction of all\nsequence possibilities. From this argument it is easy to see that, even under extreme\nselective pressures, sequences whose common ancestor is in the very distant past (i.e.\nsequences that are unrelated to one another) do not have a very high likelihood of\nconvergently discovering sequences with appreciable similarity. Even though the\nconcept of \"equilibrium\" in sequence space is thus a ludicrous one, the convergent\npicture of structural evolution does not rely on small sequence spaces. It does, however,\nrely on the assumption that the number of structural possibilities is small and that the\nprobability of finding a particular fold in sequence space (which is a function of the\n\n11\n\n\fdesignability of that fold) is distributed roughly equivalently in all regions of sequence\nspace. Think of a random walk on an infinitely large chessboard; regardless of the fact\nthat you cannot walk the entire board in finite time, the proportion of times you step on a\nwhite or black square depends only on the fraction of squares that are white and black.\nSimilarly, if the total number of folds is small and regularly distributed it is not difficult\nto imagine independent, convergent discovery of two domains in the same fold by two\nvery distantly related sequences.\nThe total number of possible folds is much more difficult to estimate than the total\nnumber of sequences. Survey of the existing protein universe reveals a total of ~800\nfolds (3), but as this represents only the existing sample of solved structures it is difficult\nto extrapolate from this number to the actual size of the entire fold universe. Attempts\naimed at estimating the number of folds that have evolved on earth vary from 1000 to\n10,000 total folds, a discrepancy that highlights the difficulties inherent in these kinds of\nestimations (6, 19-24). The protein folding and structure prediction problem remains\nunsolved for arbitrary sequences (25), and until the problem is solved it is unlikely that\nmuch reliable progress will be made on estimating the size of either the overall structural\nuniverse or the evolved subset at the fold level. The overall size is likely to be a very\nlarge number (6), but there is currently no way to reliably demonstrate that it is a large\nenough number to render the convergent scenario unlikely.\nThe increase in the amount of structural information contained in public databases\nover the past 10 years has allowed for more systematic and quantitative analysis of the\nheterogeneity in fold sizes. Given a fairly large number of solved protein structures it is\npossible to calculate the probability of observing a fold with a certain number of\n\n12\n\n\fconstituent families. The fold size distribution in SCOP and other databases has been\ncalculated at different times by a number of different groups, and in each case it has been\nshown that this distribution is well-described by a scaling law, i.e. if m is the number of\nfamilies in a fold then p(m) ~ m-\u03bc (6, 26-28) (one example of this observation, taken from\nthe work of Gerstein and coworkers (26), is shown in Figure 2A and 2B). These\nobservations clearly demonstrate the fold size heterogeneity mentioned in passing above:\nin such distributions folds of size one (known as \"orphans\") dominate the population but\nfolds with 100s of member domains may also be found (6, 26-28). This \"scale-free\" fold\nsize distribution provided perhaps the first global, quantitative feature of the evolved\nprotein structural universe against which models of protein structural evolution could be\ntested.\nA number of divergent models, collectively named the Birth, Death and\nInnovation (BDIM) models by Koonin and coworkers (6, 26, 29), were proposed to\nexplain this behavior (for a schematic of one such model taken from (6), see Figure 2C).\nThese models are based on the principle that specific sequences within domain families\nare sometimes duplicated and, through a sufficient number of mutations, found new\ndomain families of their own. A newly \"born\" domain is always of the same fold as the\nparent domain, and so duplication of existing domains increases that fold's representation\nand consequently its size. Domain loss (or \"death\") mechanisms remove sequence\nfamilies from existence and reduce a fold's size. Innovation is treated as a source that\nseeds new folds, and in a divergent model they basically represent the constant generation\nof brand new topologies from the set of all duplication events. In these models the birth\n\n13\n\n\fFigure 2\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nFigure 2. The Fold-Size distribution in organisms: observations and models.

(B) A plot similar to that in A (again taken from (27)) but for\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae. (C) A schematic of the BDIM model as a representative for divergent models\nthat can reproduce the distributions in B and C. Taken from (6),\n\n14\n\n\fand death rates depend on the size of the fold (as one would expect) and can be varied\nindependently of one another. In a certain parameter regime one finds that the\ndistribution of fold sizes is indeed scale free. The trend in the parameters that give rise to\nthis behavior are, in general, quite reasonable: they predict that the death rate roughly\nequals the birth rate for large folds but is much larger than the birth rate for small ones (6,\n28). This could easily arise from the fact that larger folds are older than younger folds in\nBDIM models; although it is not explicitly modeled, the families in older folds will have\nhad more time to accrue orthologs and paralogs and thus have a greater number of\nsequence representatives, making complete loss of that family from the evolved protein\nuniverse less likely.\nThe understanding of protein structural evolution that underlies the BDIM\nmodels, i.e. that of fold and family expansion under structural constraints, was explored\nin greater theoretical detail by Dokholyan and Shakhnovich (30). In this work they\nposited that protein evolution could be understood in terms of a \"free energy landscape\"\nin both sequence and structure space. Local exploration of sequence-structure pockets\n(which correspond to local minima on the evolutionary landscape) occurs on some\ntimescale and represents the diffusion of orthologs and paralogs with respect to one\nanother within this pocket. The pocket itself is defined by a key set of residues that are\nconstrained to certain amino acids in order for that set of sequences to support folding\ninto a given structure, a fact that results in the conservation of specific amino acids or\namino acid types at certain positions within the sequence family (30). On a separate time\nscale, some sequences cross \"barriers\" in this landscape and seed new local minima.\nThese local minima are unrelated from the standpoint of sequence comparison. The new\n\n15\n\n\fsequence pocket may be subsequently explored on a shorter timescale with certain\nresidues constrained. Sometimes these transitions result in structures that are similar to\nthe original structure (i.e. duplication events that serve to increase fold sizes in the BDIM\nmodels). In this case, comparison of the two sequence pockets demonstrates that the\nidentity of the conserved residues differs between the two but the structural similarity is\nmaintained because the relative positions of these conserved residues do not change. In\nother cases structural similarity is not maintained and a brand new fold is discovered\n(corresponding to the \"innovation\" step in BDIM-type models) (30). Dokholyan and\nShakhnovich explored a model of protein evolution involving real protein structures and\nfound that those residues with low substitution rates in their model tended to have low\n\"Conservatism of Conservatism\" (CoC) entropies (30, 31). The CoC quantity considers\nfamilies of sequences that belong to the same fold and identifies positions in those\nsequence families that are highly conserved within families (i.e. have low sequence\nvariance) and tend to be highly conserved in the set of families in the fold (i.e. positions\nthat have low sequence entropy in many families within the fold) (30, 31).\nAlthough these results are encouraging from the standpoint of divergent structural\nevolution, the existence of a divergent model that explains some feature of the protein\nstructural universe cannot be taken as evidence against the convergent hypothesis. In this\ncase, the convergent hypothesis has only to assert that the underlying distribution of fold\ndesignabilities follows a scaling law itself. This assumption is difficult to prove, but\nearly analysis of the designabilities of lattice polymer structures (in this case all compact\nconformations of 27-mers on the cubic lattice) (32) demonstrated that a power-law\ndistribution of designabilities existed in this model system and thus was not out of the\n\n16\n\n\fquestion for protein structures. Also, within a convergent picture, designability\nconstraints introduced by structural characteristics of a fold could easily impose\nconservation patterns similar to those observed in divergent simulations in the absence of\ndivergent mechanisms.\nThe Protein Domain Universe Graph\nThe next insight into the protein structural evolution on this scale involved\nlooking at protein structures at greater (although still quite coarse-grained) resolution. As\nmentioned above it is clear that binning all structures of the \"TIM barrel\" topology\ntogether as one group, however natural, tends to ignore the existence of structural\ndifferences within a fold despite the fact that some differences are fairly clear (3).\nMoving to that level of description requires not only a method of measuring those\npairwise relationships (which is impossible in databases such as SCOP and CATH due to\ntheir inherently binned and taxonomic organization) and a method of representing them\nin order to understand their implications for the protein structural universe. The former\nwas provided by FSSP in the form of the DALI Z-score; the latter was provided by a\ngraph theoretic representation of protein structural similarity. Dokholyan and coworkers\ncombined these concepts, resulting in a representation of existing protein structures that\nis called the Protein Domain Universe Graph (PDUG) (33).\nAlthough the protein structural universe had been discussed in terms of network\ntheory (6, 29), the PDUG represented the first truly systematic application of this\nmethodology to distributions of protein structural similarity. In the PDUG, nodes are\ntaken to be domain families, and the structural comparisons that form the basis of the\nedges on the graph are computed using single structural representatives from these\n\n17\n\n\ffamilies. Given the strong correspondence in structure between related sequences, the\nchoice of representative from each family should not matter in terms of the nature of the\ngraph. The DALI Z-score of structural overlap between every pair of these\nrepresentatives is employed to define the edges on the graph. To transform the weighted\ngraph (in which every edge is, in a sense, \"labeled\" with the Z-score that defines it) into\nan unweighted graph in which every edge is treated equivalently, one defines a cutoff\nparameter Zmin such that unweighted edges are only placed between domains i and j if Zij\n\u2265 Zmin (33). This transformation is conducted because the statistical properties of\nunweighted graphs are more amenable to theoretical analysis and because it is easy to\ndefine sets of related domains as clusters in the resulting graph (33).\nThe transformation described above, however useful, introduces a parameter into\nthe system (Zmin) and it is unclear a priori what value one should choose to construct the\ngraph. The fact that DALI only reports Z-scores of 2 or greater indicates that, at least in\nthis graph, there is an ultimate lower bound for Zmin, but that point may not be the most\ninstructive for creating the graph. A self-consistent way to determine this parameter\ninvolves following the transition in the Giant Component (GC) of the graph (33). In this\nprocedure one steadily increases Zmin and builds graphs at cutoffs of ever increasing\nstringency. Clusters in the graph are defined as a set of nodes for which a path exists in\nthe graph between any pair of nodes in the set; i.e. at each cutoff one determines the\ndisjoint clusters that exist on the graph. The largest cluster so determined is called the\nGiant Component of the graph. As the cutoff becomes more stringent the GC can only\nbecome smaller, and in the case of graphs like the PDUG one can imagine that a\ntransition must occur between a completely connected graph (i.e. a Zmin of negative\n\n18\n\n\finfinity) and a completely disconnected graph (i.e. a Zmin of positive infinity). This\ntransition occurs over a small range of Zmin values in the PDUG, and the midpoint of this\ntransition, which occurs at a critical value (Zc), represents an opportune cutoff at which to\nconstruct the graph. The PDUG exhibits a Zc ~ 9 (see Figure 3A, taken from (33), for the\ntransition in the GC for the PDUG), and the disjoint clusters on the graph at this point\n(the Giant Component and all other clusters) correspond fairly well to various levels of\ntaxonomic description in SCOP and CATH (15). Indeed there is some evidence to\nindicate that the set of transitions in cluster sizes in the PDUG correspond to the natural\n(human-annotated) levels of structural classification (15).\nGiven that the distribution of cluster sizes on the graph is the analog of the\ndistribution of fold sizes discussed in the previous section, it is clear that this distribution\nshould follow a power-law, which is indeed the case (6, 33). One of the important\nfeatures of the graph theoretic representation of the protein universe embodied by the\nPDUG is that it allows one to start conducting random controls that are difficult if not\nimpossible to imagine in hierarchical taxonomies. One such important control is to\nsimply randomize the entire matrix of Z-scores; that is, to remove all evolutionary\ninformation from edges on the graph. Analysis of the resulting randomized graph at the\nmidpoint in its GC transition reveals that the distribution of cluster sizes follows a power\nlaw that is nearly identical to that observed for the evolved set of relationships (see\nFigure 3Band 3C, (33)). This surprising result indicates that the cluster (or fold) size\ndistributions that we observe fails the most trivial random control in that they cannot\ndistinguish between the randomized system and the actual PDUG. This result does not\nindicate that the cluster size distribution in the PDUG is itself a random effect; it could\n\n19\n\n\fFigure 3\nA\n\nC\n\nB\n\nFigure 3. Transition in the Giant Component and cluster-size distribution in the PDUG, taken from (33).\n(A) Transition in the GC for the PDUG; as the Zmin is increased, the size of the GC decreases in a fairly\nsharp fashion with a Zc ~ 9. (B) Transition in the GC for the randomized version of the PDUG. In this\ncase Zc ~ 11. (C) Cluster size distribution for both the PDUG and randomized versions of the PDUG. The\nx-axis represents the number of proteins in a given cluster, and the y-axis represents the probability of\nfinding a cluster with that number of members. This plot is essentially analogous to the plots in Fig. 2 A\nand B. Note the striking similarity in the nature of the distributions for the PDUG and the randomized\nversions.\n\ncertainly be a result of specific evolutionary dynamics. It does, however, indicate that\ncluster size distributions do not contain sufficient information to be useful in testing\nmodels of protein structural evolution, despite the many attempts that had been made to\ndo so (6, 26-28, 33). The surprising result of this random control highlights not only the\nutility of the graph theoretic representation but also the difficulty of interpreting the\nresults of structural analyses in the absence of controls.\nThe PDUG does differ from its randomized counterparts, however, in terms of its\ntopology. One of the most important topological features of a graph is its degree\n20\n\n\fdistribution (34), which represents the probability of finding a node in the graph with a\ncertain number of neighbors. In the PDUG the degree (represented by the variable k) of a\nnode is simply the number of structural neighbors it has at that Zmin, and at the midpoint\nin the GC transition the distribution of this quantity is well-fit by a power law, i.e. p(k) ~\nk-\u03b3 with \u03b3 ~ 1.6. The degree distribution of the randomized graph is strikingly different\nand has a Gaussian character at the midpoint of its GC transition, indicating that the\ndegree distribution at least passes this most basic random control (see Figure 4A and 4B,\n(33)). The distribution of edges per node in the PDUG indicates that this graph belongs\nto a large class of graphs that have been termed \"scale-free networks\" (34-39). Although\nthe protein structural universe had been compared to such networks previously (6), the\ndevelopment of the PDUG was the first demonstration that this was indeed the case.\nIn order to explain the degree distribution, Dokholyan and coworkers developed a\ndivergent, Big Bang (BB) model for protein structural evolution (33). This model is\nbased on the fundamental principle that new domain families, i.e. new nodes on the\ngraph, arise from the duplication of sequences within existing families that subsequently\ndiverge to form new domain families. The rules governing the graphical relationship of\nnodes to one another are quite simple. Each divergence event is characterized by a\nrandom structural distance that is generated to describe the relative similarity between the\n\"daughter\" and the \"parent\" node; in the BB model the distance is chosen from a uniform\ndistribution on the interval from 0 to 1. A cutoff is defined in the system such that two\nnodes are considered similar only if their distance is below that cutoff. If the daughter\nnode is not similar to the parent node (i.e. if the randomly generated distance is below the\n\n21\n\n\fFigure 4\nA\n\nC\n\nB\n\nFigure 4. Degree distributions, taken from (33).

(B) Degree distribution of randomized\nPDUGs at a Zc; note the marked difference between this degree distribution and that of the actual PDUG in\nA. The solid line indicates a Gaussian fit; the fact that this function well-fits the data supports the\ninterpretation that the randomized PDUGs represent classical random graphs. (C) Degree distribution of\nan ensemble of graphs produced by the BB model. The straight line indicates a power-law fit with an\nexponent of 1.55.\n\ncutoff) the newly born node becomes an orphan and is prevented from touching anything\nelse on the graph; the cutoff basically creates a probability for creating nodes that can\n\n22\n\n\fseed new clusters. If the daughter node is similar to the parent an edge between the\ndaughter and parent is placed on the graph. Neighbors of the parent node (the\ngrandmother and siblings of the daughter node) have a probability of connecting the\ndaughter node that is dependent on the distance between the parent and those adjoining\nnodes (33). Although this model is similar in spirit to the \"preferential attachment\"\nmodels for scale-free networks popularized by Barabasi and coworkers (34, 35), there are\nmany important and clear differences between the two sets of models that allow the BB\nmodel to create networks that are scale-free with exponents less than 2 (i.e. \u03b3 ~ 1.6) (3335, 40). This model is strongly informed by the \"free-energy landscape\" picture of\nstructural evolution (30, 33), and although it does not model the specific processes or\ntimescales of sequence change at varying levels, the divergent rules that the BB model\nuses are based on features of this paradigm.\nWithin a certain parameter regime, the BB model produces graphs with degree\ndistributions that are well fit by power-law functions with exponents similar to that\nobserved in the PDUG (see Figure 4C, (33)). As with the earlier models for cluster size\ndistribution, this is quite encouraging for the divergent point of view; it at least implies\nthat divergence is a plausible explanation for the observation of scaling in the structural\nsimilarity network. It does not, however, provide conclusive evidence for divergence nor\nrule out the existence of a competing convergent model that might explain the same\ngraph theoretic observations.\nFurther exploration of the convergent/divergent debate has taken two separate\npaths. The first involves understanding the evolution of lattice polymers in a model\nsystem meant to replicate the features of protein folding, structure and evolution. The\n\n23\n\n\fsecond set of studies involves more detailed analysis of existing sets of protein structures\nand their distribution in various proteomes. We will first turn to a number of early\nlessons that were learned from lattice proteins consider the implications they have for\nunderstanding the evolution of protein structures.\nSome Lessons from the Lattice\nMuch of our theoretical understanding of protein folding, evolution and even\nfunction is derived from careful studies of a class of model proteins known collectively as\nlattice polymers. The monomers or building blocks of these polymers (i.e. the lattice\nequivalent of the amino acid) are constrained such that they can only occupy a set of sites\nthat make up a lattice in either 2 or 3 dimensions. The monomers are held together by a\nset of unbreakable bonds of exactly the same length as the lattice spacing. A lattice\nconformation is defined as a distinct way of \"snaking\" the polymer through lattice sites\nwithout stretching or breaking any of these bonds; basically, such conformations\ncorrespond to a self-avoiding random walk on that lattice with a number of steps given by\nthe length of the polymer. Although these lattice polymers represent a very coarsegrained \"model\" of protein structure and behavior, they present several advantages that\nmake them an ideal system for studying certain features of protein folding and evolution\n(41-47).\nForemost among these is the fact that all possible conformations of some lattice\npolymers may be completely enumerated (41, 42, 46, 47). This fact, combined with the\nlimited degrees of freedom that exist for a lattice polymer, has allowed the lattice\n\"folding problem\" to be solved both thermodynamically and kinetically. That is, if one\ndefines an alphabet of monomers and a potential energy function governing their\n\n24\n\n\finteractions, one can determine the energy of a sequence in all conformations and\ndetermine whether that sequence will fold into its particular ground state, which may be\nverified kinetically by Monte Carlo folding simulations (42, 45, 48). Study of such\nsystems has lead to a number of important insights into protein folding, including the\ndiscovery that if a sequence exhibits a low energy in a particular conformation when\ncompared with the spectrum of available conformations it will fold into that state (42, 45,\n49-51).\nGiven the extensive work that has been done on folding in lattice systems it is no\nsurprise that a lot of theoretical work on protein evolution has also focused on this class\nof polymers (43, 46, 47). Many of these studies have actually focused on the nature of\nsequence distributions and dynamics when one constrains folding to choose a particular\nstructure or small set of structures, a fact that has prevented these systems from providing\nmany insights into the systematics of protein structure discussed at length above. These\nresults are very important in their own right and it is instructive to consider them briefly\nbefore turning again to a more structure-centric picture.\nOne of the most important concepts that arose from the study of model proteins\n(and of RNA secondary structure) was that of a \"neutral network\" (47, 52). This network\nconsists of a set of sequences that are related to one another through sets of point\nmutations that do not influence some critical feature of the protein (i.e. structure of the\nnative state, stability, folding rate, etc.). In very simplified lattice models (2-D square\nlattices with HP potentials), if one defines a neutral network based on the fact that the\nconstituent sequences all exhibit a particular lattice conformation as their ground\nenergetic state, these networks tend to be organized hierarchically with highly connected\n\n25\n\n\f\"internal\" sequences that are very energetically stable in this native state and less well\nconnected \"edge\" sequences that are also less stable (47, 53, 54). These results recall the\nstructure of neutral networks in RNA secondary structure, although there are some very\nimportant differences between the two cases (55, 56). In RNA, for example, many\nsequences exist that are in one neutral network but close to the network of another\nstructure; in 2-D model proteins such bridges are much more rare (47, 55, 57, 58). The\nlimited nature of 2-D lattice models and HP potentials notwithstanding, these results\nprovided the earliest glimpse of what the evolutionary landscape of proteins might be\nlike.\nMore dynamic study of the sequence evolution of 2-D lattice polymers has also\nbeen carried out in the context of population genetics (59-61). In these cases structures\nwere considered \"functional\" and \"viable\" on the basis of whether or not they could fold\ninto a distinct ground state as measured by a foldability criterion (essentially a folding Zscore, see definition below) (42, 45, 48). Simulations of these systems demonstrated that\nboth designability and evolutionary history have a strong influence on the number and\ntype of structures that are observed. Certain sequences, although highly represented in a\ncompletely random search of sequence space, were not as well represented during the\npopulation dynamics either due to the topology of the sequence landscape (i.e. structures\nthat have sequences that are not \"robust\" to mutation) or due to fact that sequence space\nwas not fully sampled during the evolution (59). These results indicate that\ndesignability, while it certainly plays a role in the probability of observing a particular\nstructure, may not be the only factor, a conclusion that has been borne out through later\nwork discussed in the section on designability below. Further application of a this\n\n26\n\n\fmethodology provided some evidence that the marginal stability and mutational\nrobustness that are observed for real proteins may result from the nature of sequence\ndynamics in populations evolving under a folding constraint (60, 61).\nOne extremely important study of lattice sequences and structures was briefly\nmentioned above as it provides some evidence for convergence in the\nconvergent/divergent debate. Wingreen and coworkers enumerated all sequences for the\nlattice 27-mer using the hydrophobic-polar (HP) potential (32). Given the relatively\nsmall number of sequences that can be generated using 27 letters in a 2-letter alphabet,\nthey were able to apply each sequence to all of the 103,346 distinct, maximally compact\nconformations of the 27-mer on the cubic lattice and determine the lowest energy\nconformation for each sequence (32, 41). Their results demonstrated that some lattice\nstructures were \"chosen\" as the ground state by many, many more sequences than other\nstructures, indicating that the concept of designability seemed to fit the behavior of these\nlattice polymers fairly well. Indeed, the distribution of sequence volumes per polymer\nwas somewhat similar to the distribution of fold family sizes and lent some weight to the\nidea that convergent evolution dominated by designability differences might not be a bad\ndescription of actual protein evolution (see Figure 5, (6, 32)). Although a number of\ncaveats about this work may be raised (including the potential problems that HP models\nhave in defining energetically distinct ground states in 3-D lattices), from the results\ndiscussed above it is clear that any understanding of protein evolution either on the lattice\nor off of it must at least consider designability to some extent.\nMuch of the work that has been done on sequence-based structural evolution in\nlattice systems has considered only the simplest possible \"functional\" criterion; namely,\n\n27\n\n\fFigure 5\n\nFigure 5. The distribution of sequence occupancy in a complete enumeration of lattice polymer sequences,\nmodified from (32). The x-axis represents the number of sequences that correspond to a given lattice\nstructure and the y-axis represents the number of structures in the analysis that exhibited that number of\nsequences. Note the similarity between the power-law tail of this distribution and the actual fold size\ndistributions in Figure 2A and 2B and the similarity to the Pareto distributions described in (6)\n\nthat of rapid folding to a distinct native state. Attempts have been made, however, to\nmodel higher levels of functionality in 2-D and 3-D lattice systems. Most notably, Hirst\nand coworkers (47, 62-64) have explored the effects of functional constraints on\n\"neutral\" networks (at least from the perspective of native state and folding ability) using\nan HP potential in the square 2-D lattice and diamond 3-D lattice. In this case they\nallowed for non-compact lattice conformations and looked for sets of sequence/structure\npairs that demonstrate \"binding pockets\" for hydrophobic ligands. In this case adaptive\nevolution for function consisted of increasing the hydrophobicity of the binding pocket.\nAlthough the results of this work may be very sensitive to the assumptions of the model\n\n28\n\n\f(62-64), it is clear that the inclusion of functional considerations such as ligand binding\n(and, by extension, catalytic active sites, allosteric regulatory sites, etc.) changes the\nnature of neutral networks quite considerably. These results are consistent with the\nobservation that not all conservation patterns that define the nature of sequence families\nare likely to derive from a need for stability or kinetic foldability; in some cases\nconserved residues or CoC patterns may result from functional considerations (30, 31).\nReasonable and intelligent incorporation of functional effects into divergent models of\nprotein evolution either on the lattice or off of it represents a challenge to the modeling of\nstructural evolution that has yet to be fully met (47, 62-64).\nStructural Evolution on the Lattice: Graph Theoretic Approaches\nAlthough the idea of an underlying \"structural space\" for polypeptides had been\nproposed and discussed for many years (6, 65), by the time the PDUG was discovered\nand analyzed there was very little direct understanding of what features this space might\nhave. Although the scale-free distribution of structural neighbors in the PDUG was\nclearly not a random effect (33), it was unclear whether or not the space of similarities\nbetween any set of compact polymers might actually define a similar network. Not only\nwas such a polymeric control important for understanding the uniqueness and\nevolutionary implications of scaling in the PDUG; it was also important for quantifying\nand understanding how a protein structural space might influence the evolution of\nproteins within that space.\nAs mentioned above it is currently impossible to understand or characterize the\ncomplete space of polypeptide structures. Lattice spaces, however, do not share this\nlimitation and many complete structural sets are available for both 2-D and 3-D lattice\n\n29\n\n\fsystems. In our work on this subject, we chose to explore the structural space of the\ncompletely compact 27-mer on the 3X3X3 cubic lattice; although this system lacks many\nfeatures of real proteins (such as secondary structure elements), it has enough structural\ndiversity to provide potentially interesting results yet the space is small enough to allow\nfor all pairwise structural comparisons to be made (66). Despite the shortcomings of this\nmodel system, it provided the necessary compact polymer control against which the\nPDUG could be compared and allowed for the first complete characterization of a\nphysically realistic structural space.\nGiven that a hierarchical taxonomy of lattice structures would be difficult to\nenvision or build using human intuition, the lattice structural space was used to create a\ngraph in much the same manner as the PDUG. Each distinct lattice conformation was\ndefined as a node, and all pairwise structural comparisons between nodes were conducted\nin order to build edges between these nodes. The structural comparisons, in analog to the\nDALI Z-score, were based on the overlap in contact maps between two structures, and\nthe distribution of the lattices \"S-scores\" at large values was very similar to the\ndistribution of Dali Z-scores in the PDUG (33, 66). Edges in the Lattice Structure Graph\n(LSG) were placed when any two nodes have an S-score greater than the cutoff Smin.\nDegree distributions for all structures in the LSG at each value of the Smin cutoff were\nwell-fit by Gaussian functions and are much more akin to classic random graphs (and the\nrandomized PDUG control) than the scale-free PDUG characteristic of structural\nevolution (see Figure 6A, (33, 66)). It is thus clear that a scale-free network of structural\nrelationships is at least not a generic feature of compact polymer spaces.\n\n30\n\n\fFigure 6\nA\n\nC\n\nB\n\nD\n\nFigure 6. Results from the analysis of the LSG, taken from (66). (A) Degree distributions of the entire\nLSG at a variety of Smin values as indicated. All of these degree distributions are well-fit by Gaussian\nfunctions and lack the characteristic power-law features found in the PDUG. (B) The degree distributions\nof two subgraphs sampled from the LSG using the divergent evolutionary algorithm described in the text at\n2 different values of the orphan-creation probability (pO). Both are well-fit by power-law functions (solid\nlines) and the data set indicated in green exhibits a power-law exponent \u03b3 of 1.6. (C) Cluster size\ndistributions for a number of random subgraphs of the LSG. The cluster size distributions of these random\nsubgraphs are virtually indistinguishable from the cluster size distributions of the PDUG, randomized\nPDUG or any other type of subgraph of the LSG. The solid line indicates a power-law fit of the\ndistribution from a representative random subgraph. All of the graphs were analyzed at the midpoint in the\ntransition of the GC. (D) A comparison of the cluster size distributions of evolved subgraphs (with degree\ndistributions from B) to the random subgraphs from C.\n\n31\n\n\fThe random-graph-like degree distribution in the LSG, although it is not\nnecessarily indicative of the nature of the space of actual compact polypeptides,\nnonetheless suggests the following question: if an underlying space of structural\npossibilities is not scale-free, is there any way in which the space might be sampled in\norder to produce scale-free networks? This view of structural evolution poses the\nproblem not as one of domain \"creation\" or \"innovation\" but rather as a sampling process\nthrough which structures that exist in the space of possibilities come into existence when\na sequence is found that can fold into them. As one would expect, sampling 3500\nstructures (i.e. a number of nodes equivalent to that in the PDUG) from the LSG\ncompletely randomly (i.e. choosing structures with equal probability from the graph)\ndoes not produce scale-free networks (66). Some sort of sampling bias is required to\nobtain scale-free subgraphs of the LSG.\nOne might first imagine that one could choose lattice structures on the basis of\ntheir designability. As we will discuss in much greater detail below, for lattice structures\nit is possible to accurately estimate the designability of a conformation based on features\nof its contact map (67), and one can imagine that evolution might sample only those\nstructures that are highly designable. The resulting set of structures does not, however,\nrepresent a scale-free network, although it does differ from a random subgraph of the\nLSG (66). The main difference between the random subgraph and the set of highly\ndesignable structures is the average connectivity-highly designable structures tend to\nshare structural features and so the average number of connections for that subset at a\ncertain cutoff is much higher than the average number of connections for the random\nsubset. Although this result does not guarantee that sampling according to designability\n\n32\n\n\fin a real polypeptide space would not yield a scale-free network of structural similarity,\ndoing so in the LSG is clearly insufficient to obtain scaling.\nAnother set of sampling algorithms involves dynamically choosing structures\nfrom the graph in accordance with evolutionary rules. Such models are similar in spirit to\nthe original BB model but, rather than creating nodes out of thin air and ordering their\nsimilarity according to an (ultimately) arbitrary set of rules, they are constrained to\nchoose only existing lattice structures as nodes and must abide by the existing structural\nrelationships that constitute the LSG. Such algorithms may utilize the structural\nrelationships in order to choose nodes, but they cannot set or change those relationships.\nWe found that certain classes of models based on \"duplication and divergence\" could\nindeed sample PDUG-like scale-free networks of structures from the LSG (see Figure\n6B, (66)). Duplication events in these models involve picking a random structure from\nthe evolved subset and choosing a daughter structure with some particular structural\ndistance from the parent (which is equivalent to the structural divergence that occurs\nduring duplication in the original BB model). These models differ strongly from the\noriginal BB model in the manner in which orphans are chosen, however. In the original\nalgorithm, structures that diverge beyond a cutoff do not contact the parent node and are\nprevented from contacting any node that currently exists on the graph. In the lattice\nmodel, however, simply choosing some daughter nodes that are beyond a given structural\nsimilarity cutoff did not yield PDUG-like behavior; in essence, even structures that are\nvery far from any given parent have an appreciable probability of being similar to some\nother structure in the evolved subgraph and thus do not necessarily represent \"true\norphans\" (33, 66). In order to evolve scale-free networks it was necessary to introduce a\n\n33\n\n\fprobability that a daughter would represent a true orphan and choose such orphans from\nthe ensemble of structures in the LSG that did not exhibit strong structural similarity to\nany evolved structure at that particular point in time. The inclusion of this global\nsimilarity calculation represents a marked departure from the original, purely local, BB\nmodel and poses the interesting question of how sequence evolution alone could choose\nsuch orphans (a point discussed in greater detail below).\nAt this point it is important to stress the necessity of using specific topological\nobservables (such as the degree distribution) to compare models with one another, the\nLSG and the existing protein universe. At the transition in the GC, every type of LSG\nsubgraph exhibits a scale-free distribution of cluster sizes with exponents similar to one\nanother and to that of real proteins (see Figure 6C and 6D, (66)). It is thus impossible in\nthis system to identify a graph as having been sampled randomly, according to\ndesignability or according to divergent evolutionary rules simply on the basis of the\ncluster size distribution. The differences in degree distribution between the different\nsampling methods are, however, extremely clear. This result was foreshadowed by the\nrandomized PDUG control but it is nonetheless a clear example of the limitations of\nconsidering only cluster size distributions (6, 26-28, 33).\nAlthough the results outlined above are important as a proof of evolutionary\nprinciple, they do not represent a clear bridge between the sequence-based studies of\nlattice structures outlined above and the topological structure of the PDUG. The\napplication of the BB model to the LSG has a clearly dynamic and divergent character,\nhowever, it is impossible to know whether the \"divergent\" rules discussed in the\npreceding paragraphs accurately represent the types of structural changes that occur\n\n34\n\n\fduring sequence divergence. It is fairly obvious that organisms cannot perform the kind\nof structural comparisons required by the algorithm as they evolve; for instance, an\norganism cannot explicitly determine whether or not a newly evolved domain is a\nstructural orphan (66). One of the important questions raised by the LSG work involved\nunderstanding if sequence dynamics alone could provide the basis for scale-free networks\nof lattice structures; that is, whether it was possible to bridge the gap between the work of\nTaverna and Goldstein and the graph-theoretic approach to understanding structural\nrelationships and diversity (33, 59, 66).\nTo approach this problem we built a completely physical, sequence-based model\nof structural evolution that relies on absolutely no structural information to build a\nsubgraph (68). This model is based on the folding of 27-mer sequences into compact\nlattice structures and is based on a specific alphabet and potential energy function for\nwhich folding can be evaluated (which in our case was the Mirny-Shakhnovich potential\nin all 20 amino acids) (69-71). Running Monte Carlo folding simulations of lattice\npolymers, while certainly not nearly as computationally intensive as folding simulations\nof proteins with realistic degrees of freedom, is nonetheless computationally costly and\nso rather than verify folding directly we employed an energy Z-score (here called an Fscore):\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Fi,k is the F-score of sequence i in conformation k, <Ei> is the average energy of\nsequence i in all conformations, and \u03c3Ei is the standard deviation of the energy of\nsequence i across all conformations. As mentioned briefly above, this measure of\nfoldability is derived from early work on protein folding from the spin-glass perspective\n\n35\n\n\f(45, 49, 50). A sufficiently low value of this F-score for a given sequence in a given\nlattice structure indicates that the sequence is much more stable in that structure than it is\nin the \"non-native\" ensemble and implies that the sequence will fold into that structure.\nThis principle has been used many times to design sequences to fold into lattice structures\nquickly and with high stability (48, 59-61, 68).\nThe evolutionary dynamics of this model are quite simple and are directly based\non the motivation behind the original Big Bang model and the LSG-based model\ndiscussed above. At first, one chooses a \"seed\" structure at random from the set of all\npossible structures and \"designs\" an amino acid sequence to fold into this structure. At\neach step in the simulation an existing sequence is chosen from the evolved set at random\nand is duplicated. A number of mutations are then made to this sequence during the\ndivergence step (in our case the number of mutations is set to be the same for all\nduplication events). The \"native state\" of the new sequence is determined by finding the\ncompact lattice conformation in which the sequence exhibits the lowest energy and\nfolding is assayed using the F-score. If the F-score of the sequence in its native state is\nbelow some cutoff, folding is assumed and the sequence-structure pair is added to the\ngraph in (basically) exact analogy to the schema employed by Taverna and Goldstein in\ntheir earlier work (59, 68).\nIf one sets the F-score to positive infinity, that is, if one does not specify an Fscore cutoff but accepts every new sequence along with its lowest-energy conformation,\nit is possible to obtain scale-free LSG subgraphs with PDUG-like exponents (Figure 7A).\nThe level of sequence divergence that is required to obtain these results is relatively\nsmall-only 2 mutations are made per duplication step. When there is no folding\n\n36\n\n\fFigure 7\nA\n\nB\n\nFigure 7. Degree distributions from sequence-based models of protein evolution on the lattice, taken from\n(68). (A) Degree distribution for an LSG subgraph based on the sequence-based evolutionary algorithm\nwithout a folding constraint. The solid line represents a power-law fit with an exponent \u03b3 of 1.5, close to\nthat observed in the PDUG. (B) Degree distribution of a graph evolved using a folding cutoff. The solid\nline corresponds to a power-law fit with an exponent of 1.6, close to that observed in the PDUG.\n\nconstraint the algorithm generates considerable structural diversity in a small sequence\nvolume, demonstrating that many different types of \"native\" structures live within a small\nsequence neighborhood of a given starting sequence-structure pair (68). Introduction of a\nfolding cutoff, however, drastically increases the level of sequence divergence that is\nrequired to observe PDUG-like behavior. This is to be expected; although many\nsequences that are close to a starting sequence may have native states somewhat different\n\n37\n\n\ffrom the starting structure, most of the cases in which those sequences are stable in their\nrespective native state involve structures that are very similar (if not identical) to the\nstarting structure. Thus 8-10 mutations per step are required to observe scale-free\nnetworks with the right range of exponents when the F-score cutoff is set to \u20136 (see\nFigure 7B, (68)).\nThe folding cutoff also influences other features of the model's behavior. For\none, the model starts to exhibit \"non-ergodic\" characteristics in that different starting\nsequence-structure pairs lead to differences in the nature of the evolved subgraphs. For\ninstance, one randomly chosen seed structure produces PDUG-like degree distributions\nwhen the number of mutations is equal to 8; another only does so when the number of\nmutations is set to 10. Even different simulations with the same initial condition do not\nconverge to graphs of similar behavior over the course of 3500 steps. Neither\nobservation holds true in the absence of the folding cutoff, indicating that the folding\nconstraint may make the evolutionary landscape considerably more \"rugged\" (68), a\nfinding that is in complete agreement with earlier work on the nature of evolutionary\nlandscapes (47, 72). Although the sources of this ruggedness are not currently well\nunderstood, it may have to do with the designability of structures in the regions of the\nevolutionary landscape surrounding a given starting structure. Those simulations in\nwhich a very designable structure is discovered early may have trouble developing the\nlevel of structural diversity observed when such a structure is discovered relatively late or\nnot at all. It is well-known that early events in some models for scale-free networks can\ncause \"giant fluctuations\" in the nature of the graphs they produce (73), but much further\n\n38\n\n\fwork remains if we are to understand why this occurs in these models and what\nimplications these findings may have for the evolution of real protein structures.\nRegardless, the work outlined above has three major implications. First, the\ndegree distribution of the PDUG is not a trivial result of the fact that it is constructed\nfrom a set of compact polymers. Secondly, if the underlying space of polypeptide\nstructures shares topological features with the LSG it is possible to define divergent\nevolutionary rules that sample its random-graph topology in such a way that scale-free\nnetworks may be produced. Finally, it is possible to define a model based only on the\ndivergence of actual sequences that fold into lattice structures that recapitulates the\nPDUG's graphical features. This last point is an important proof that the divergent\nprinciple, when actually modeled mechanistically, has the right ingredients to explain the\nprotein universe as we observe it today (33, 66, 68).\nResults from Structural Proteomes\nStudies on the lattice, however satisfying and important, are ultimately limited in\nthe amount of information they can provide regarding the evolution and natural history of\nprotein sequences. As mentioned above the plethora of plausible and successful\ndivergent models that exist to explain the statistical properties of the protein universe\ncannot really be taken to prove that convergent models cannot provide similar\nexplanations. In order to garner evidence against the convergent picture (rather than\nmore evidence for divergence) it is necessary to turn back to the realm of actual protein\nstructures and consider how those structures distribute themselves within the proteomes\nof existing organisms.\n\n39\n\n\fIn the spirit of developing a convergent picture of structural evolution, let us\nconsider a simple thought experiment. Suppose for a moment that the underlying space\nof polypeptide structures had a distribution of structural similarity that was scale-free and\nsomewhat similar to that observed in the PDUG. Although this is certainly not true of the\nLSG (see above), there is currently no way to actually demonstrate that this is not the\ncase for polypeptide structures with realistic degrees of freedom. Now suppose that\nsequences sampled this space of structures randomly and completely independently-that\nis, consider the \"null\" case of a convergent model. In this case one would observe a\nPDUG-like degree distribution (74) without any need for divergent mechanisms. Thus,\ndespite the promising success of divergent models in recapitulating the degree\ndistribution of the PDUG, it is surprisingly easy to create a model that explains this\nphenomenon from a simplistic convergent perspective.\nIn a sense, the only way to make strong, well-supported statements in opposition\nto either the convergent or divergent paradigm is to test both of them against some\nobservation and see if one does not fit the observed data. Although the PDUG can\nprovide a large amount of evolutionary information, it is a single, static dataset, and\ntrying to extract dynamic information from it is akin to trying to reconstruct the trajectory\nof an object based only on a snapshot of its final position. In the case of structural\ninformation, however, the existence of structural proteomes serves as a potential source\nof dynamic information. Given that organisms have been speciating from one another for\nbillions of years and given that speciation events largely separate proteomes from one\nanother (although the separation is not necessarily complete (75-78)), it is clear that the\n\n40\n\n\fdistribution of structures in organisms may actually provide important observables\nagainst which both convergent and divergent models may be tested.\nThe importance of genome-specific sets of structure, or \"structural proteomes,\" to\nthe study of protein evolution has long been recognized. As the levels of protein\nsystematics were developed, researchers immediately began wondering how they were\ndistributed between and within the three kingdoms of life. Koonin and coworkers\ndiscovered that, although there are certainly many differences between the different\nkingdoms of life in terms of their fold content, there is also a great degree of similarity, a\nfact that has also been shown to hold true in comparisons of the large eukaryotic clades\n(79, 80). These results imply, at least on a superficial level, that structural proteomes\nmight contain important \"dynamic\" information that cannot be obtained from the PDUG.\nConstructing organismal PDUGs (oPDUGs) is fairly straightforward. A node in the\nPDUG corresponds to a family of related sequences, and so if one finds at least one\nmember of that family in the proteome of a given organism, then that domain family\nexists in that organism (74, 81). This procedure allows for the extension of the solved\nstructures represented in the PDUG to a large number of organisms despite the fact that\nthe structure of a particular domain may not have been solved in all (or any) of the\norganisms in question. For those organisms with fully sequenced genomes one may\ncreate as complete a structural picture as possible by determining the domain compliment\nof that proteome. Each organismal list of domains represents a specific subgraph of the\nPDUG, and analysis of these oPDUGs has the potential to reveal dynamic information\nregarding the evolution of the protein universe. In the case of prokaryotic (bacterial and\n\n41\n\n\farchaeal) proteomes, we demonstrated that the oPDUGs exhibit scale-free networks with\nexponents that are, on average, close to the exponent observed in the PDUG (74).\nIf one considers the null convergent model above, it is clear that organisms\nevolving under this type of model will exhibit a specific type of subgraph. Starting from\na least universal common ancestor, the evolved structural universe accrues structures at\nrandom from the underlying space. Subsequently, speciation occurs, resulting in two\nproteomes that randomly sample this space independently. After billions of years of\nevolution and many speciation events, the sum total of all (randomly chosen) structures in\nexistence across all organisms will clearly constitute a random subgraph of the overall\nstructural universe and, if the underlying structural space represents a scale-free network,\nthe degree distribution of observed in the PDUG is fairly easy to explain. This model\nalso predicts that each independent proteome will constitute a random subgraph both of\nthe underlying structural space and of the PDUG (74).\nThis null hypothesis of convergence was easily tested. We considered the\noPDUG of an organism with a fully sequenced proteome (say Bacillus subtilis) and\ncreated random subgraphs of the PDUG that contain the same number of nodes as the\noPDUG in question. As one might expect, these random subgraphs exhibited scale-free\ndegree distributions similar to the B. subtilis network in terms of their exponents. These\nrandom subgraphs were strikingly different from the evolved oPDUG, however, in terms\nof the maximal connectivity found in the graph (kmax). Indeed, for many proteomes we\nfound that the kmax of the evolved graph is much, much greater than the random\ncounterpart, and this discovery indicates that the convergent null hypothesis is not likely\nto be true. Using basic graph theoretic approaches it is actually possible to quantify the\n\n42\n\n\fprobability that a particular oPDUG is a random subgraph of the PDUG (74), and in the\ncase of over 2/3 of the prokaryotic genomes considered, the P-value of randomness was\nless than 10-6 (see Figure 8A). This finding indicates that, although the null convergent\nmodel is fully capable of explaining the degree distribution of the PDUG it cannot\nexplain the observed topological features of individual structural proteomes.\nAlthough the null convergent model is fully consistent with the convergent\npicture of structural evolution, it is perhaps not surprising that organisms do not contain a\nrandom compliment of structural domains-it is difficult to imagine, for instance, that a\nfully functional set of biochemical machinery could be based on such a sampling method.\nOne might imagine that either functional or organismal constraints could lead the system\nto sample structures in a biased, but nonetheless convergent, manner. It is clear that this\nbias must in some way correspond to an increased probability of choosing domains with\nhigher values of k in order to overcome the lower kmax in unbiased random subgraphs.\nThe bias that is necessary to overcome the decrease in probability at high kmax is so\nstrong, however, that it creates unrealistic oPDUG degree distributions and as such it is\nnot a likely explanation for the oPDUGs we observed (74). The results outlined above\nindicate that a whole class of convergent models in which the state of the organismal\ngraph at time t0 cannot influence the sampling of domains from the underlying graph at\nany later time t (a class of convergent models that we call \"equilibrium convergence\") is\nunlikely.\nIt is quite easy to modify the BB model of structural evolution to include a\nmechanism of speciation. In this case structural evolution proceeds divergently exactly\nas in the BB model. The only difference is that evolution begins in a single proteome.\n\n43\n\n\fFigure 8\n\nFigure 8. Random subgraph P-values, taken from (74). (A) P-values for actual oPDUGs. The Organism\nIndex is an arbitrary number chosen to represent each oPDUG. The dotted line indicates a 1% chance that\nthe organismal subgraph is a random subgraph of the PDUG. (B) A graph as in A but for the BB\nspeciation model. P-values in this case represent the probability that a particular model organismal\nsubgraph is a random subgraph of the overall model PDUG produced by the BB algorithm. The dotted line\nindicates a 1% chance that the subgraph represents a random subgraph.\n\nAfter time this proteome undergoes a speciation event, producing two identical lineages.\nThese lineages evolve independently from one another with the restriction that any given\nduplication event must occur within a single proteome; that is, at each step a parent\ndomain can only give rise to a daughter domain in the proteome in which the duplication\n\n44\n\n\foccurred. The model oPDUGs produced by this algorithm all exhibited much larger\nvalues of kmax than random subgraphs of the resulting model PDUG and, as such, had\nvery low P-values of being random subgraphs themselves (see Figure 8B, (74)). It is thus\nclear that, while a whole class of convergent models cannot explain the oPDUGs\nobserved in nature, a divergent model easily can.\nThe results discussed above do not indicate that convergence has never or can\nnever occur, and the debate about the nature of protein structural evolution is still\nproceeding. Although many researchers now agree that the divergent scenario is more\nlikely (6), the only existing direct evidence against any convergent model(s) has been\nderived from careful analysis of the oPDUGs (74). Further study of these and other\ngraph theoretic features of the protein structural universe are necessary to explore the\nimplications of this observation in further detail and understand the extent to which\nstructural convergence of different types and on different scales may have occurred over\nthe course of structural evolution (82, 83).\nFrontiers\nDespite the progress that has been made in the past several decades towards\nunderstanding the evolution of protein structure, it is clear that the picture we have is still\na long way from complete. One of the most important efforts that are currently ongoing\nin this field is structural genomics (6, 84, 85). Although our structural coverage of some\ntypes of proteins and of some organisms is not bad (6, 24, 79, 80), data in other areas of\nthe organismal and structural universe is sparse and, as more and more structures are\nsolved, our ability to ask and answer meaningful questions regarding structural evolution\nwill increase. Structural genomics, aside from simply providing more data amenable to\n\n45\n\n\fevolutionary analysis, should also give us the most unbiased view of a number of\nstructural proteomes to this date. This data is crucial to our efforts to build ever more\naccurate models of structural evolution and ever more complete pictures of the natural\nhistory of the evolved protein universe.\nThe structural evolution models discussed above, for all their success, do have a\nnumber of failings that present important challenges to the development of a global\nunderstanding of structural evolution. One such failing is the fact that none of these\nmodels accurately predict the number of orphans that one should observe in the PDUG.\nIndeed, these models often predict fewer orphans in the graph than expected from the\npower-law fits of their degree distributions; the PDUG, however, exhibits far more\norphans than predicted by its power-law fit (33, 66, 68, 74). It is very encouraging that\nthe sequence-based model of structural evolution on the lattice predicts a predominance\nof orphans given that this model (and this model alone) contains no mechanisms geared\nspecifically at introducing orphans into the graph (68). Despite this success the number\nof orphans is still too low, and it is clear that ensuing models of structural evolution will\nhave to deal with this deficiency. Given that certain orphans represent truly new\ntopologies, they may (on average) have the ability to access more novel functions than\nnon-orphans. If we imagine that duplication and divergence are occurring frequently in\nmost populations, structural orphans could have a higher probability of being retained by\nthe population compared to non-orphans simply because they have a higher probability of\noffering a selective advantage to the subpopulation in which they occur. This would\nrepresent an effective increase in the creation of orphans and might present a very\n\n46\n\n\fintriguing link between these types of structural evolution models and the selectionist\nviewpoint favored by some (80).\nMany interesting questions remain regarding the sequence-structure landscape for\nprotein evolution in lattice systems. One area of intense interest is the influence of\ndesignability on sequence and structure dynamics. Although this has been explored to\nsome extent in the text above and is discussed further in the next section, integrating the\ndesignability picture with our understanding of structural diversity and evolutionary\nchange is an important challenge that may be best approached by further study of lattice\nmodels. In the future, efforts to map the size, shape and connections between \"neutral\nnetworks\" in sequence space could provide a number of clues not only as to the specific\ninfluences of designability but also to the nature of sequence transitions that drive\nstructural transitions. An explicit map of the sequence/structure landscape should\nprovide a much deeper understanding of the \"free-energy\" picture that motivates the\ncurrent models and understanding of structural evolution (30).\nAt this stage it is important to note that, despite the success of various stochastic\nmodels of protein evolution, the fact that all of these models lack any functional\ndescription or considerations has lead to the proposal that these models are fundamentally\ninaccurate (80). While one may certainly argue that the BB models are incomplete (they\nare each, after all, very coarse-grained descriptions of biological and/or structural reality),\nthis does not imply that their correspondence to observed topological features in the\nPDUG is necessarily serendipitous. Indeed, these models indicate that duplication and\ndivergence is sufficient to obtain PDUG-like behavior, which represents a supremely\nimportant proof of evolutionary principle. Designability and functional utility may\n\n47\n\n\fcertainly impact which folds are highly populated and which domains have high\ndegrees-this point is explored further in the next section. Regardless, such\nconsiderations are not necessary to describe the overall statistical properties of the protein\nuniverse, and this implies that these properties are most likely a fundamental\nconsequence of the underlying mechanism of duplication and divergence upon which\nevolutionary selection may act. BB-type models imply that both selection and\nduplication/divergence may affect the distribution of protein structures, and features of\nthese models provide some explanation of the uneven distribution of populations even\namong families and folds that perform the same function (6, 86).\nAlthough the convergent/divergent debate is considered dead by some, there are\nmany aspects of structural evolution that may be informed by a convergent picture. As\nmentioned above, a divergent picture of structural evolution is certainly in no way\nincompatible with the \"convergent\" concept of designability. It is also clear that\nfunctional constraints may actually cause the convergence of local structural elements in\nstructures that clearly belong to different folds; that is, structural convergence may occur\nin the active sites of certain enzymes that are clearly unrelated at the cluster/fold level of\ntopological description (6, 68, 74, 82, 83). Much like the physical nature of flight\nconstrains the nature of a wing and thus leads to convergent similarity in independently\nevolved wing structures, so the physical reality of catalysis may cause \"convergent\"\npositioning of residues, functional groups or even elements of secondary structure within\na small region of a domain. This proposal is in no way inconsistent with the divergent\npicture of domain evolution; in this case local similarity can easily arise in the context of\nglobal structural expansion.\n\n48\n\n\fDesignability and Protein Evolution\nStructural Determinants\nAlthough the concept of designability has been central to the\nconvergent/divergent debate, especially on the convergent side, the concept does not\ndepend on a convergent picture of structural evolution. Although the motivation for\nproposing this concept, i.e. the observation of heterogeneity in fold space (6, 16-18), may\nnot ultimately derive solely from differences in designability, it is clear that, at least in\nprinciple, some types of protein structures may correspond to a greater number of\nsequences than other structures. Many researchers have demonstrated that lattice\npolymer systems exhibit certain structures have much larger designabilities than others\n(32, 59). Given the very complete nature of many of these studies, the designability\neffect seems to be quite real, structure-specific, and independent of any specific\nevolutionary mechanism. Despite this clear demonstration of the concept, these studies\ndid not provide many quantitative insights as to the specific features that make some\nprotein structures more designable than others.\nEarly analysis of real and model protein structures that seemed to have high\ndesignability (such as the TIM barrel) indicated that certain structural features such as\nsymmetry defined these types of structures (32, 87). This was followed by work that\ncapitalized on this idea and attempted to develop a structural predictor of designability\nwith somewhat limited success (87, 88). Recently, England and Shakhnovich developed\nan analytical approach that served as the basis for a designability measure (67). They\ndemonstrated that (under certain assumptions) the per-monomer free energy (f) of a\n\n49\n\n\fstructure in sequence space could be expressed as a function of traces of powers of the\ncontact map, i.e.:\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere N is the number of residues in the polymer, C is the residue-residue contact matrix\ndefining the structure, and an is a positive weight that depends on the residue-residue\ncontact energies from a potential energy matrix B. The trace of powers of the contact\nmap sounds like a very abstract quantity, but it actually has a fairly clear and intuitive\nphysical interpretation. The trace of the nth power of a contact matrix represents the\nnumber of n-member cycles in that matrix, which indicates that the contacts between\nthese n amino acids are ideally arranged to provide maximal stability, thus relaxing the\nstability constraints on the rest of the sequence (67). Although this measure is based on\ncertain assumptions (such as the idea that protein energetics may be completely\nrepresented through a pairwise contact potential and some assumptions about the nature\nof the potential energy function B), it is a very good predictor of designabilities measured\ndirectly for lattice proteins where the energetics are explicitly constrained to a contact\nform (see Figure 9, (67)). Even though the designability measure was not used to\nevaluate a complete sample of either sequence or lattice structure space as performed by\nWingreen and coworkers (32), it is at least reasonable to assume that many of the\nstructural influences on designability of lattice structures are being captured by this\nmeasure.\nThe England-Shakhnovich (ES) designability measure introduced above has been\nemployed in a number of subsequent studies, including the LSG work discussed in the\npreceding section. In the first demonstration that this measure might capture some\n\n50\n\n\fFigure 9\n\nFigure 9. Success of the ES designability measure for lattice proteins, taken from (67). In this plot the xaxis represents the ES measure of designability as outlined in equation 2. The y-axis represents empirically\ndetermined sequence entropies from simulations in which lattice sequences were designed to fold into\nspecific lattice structures (i.e., tent to exhibit low F-scores as discussed previously). The correlation\nbetween the predicted and observed entropy in this case is quite good (R = 0.92), indicating that the ES\nmeasure is a successful indicator of designability at least for lattice proteins.\n\nimportant features of protein stability and designability off of the lattice, England,\nShakhnovich and Shakhnovich showed that thermophilic proteins are statistically\nsignificantly more designable than mesophilic proteins (89). Given that the theory\nbehind the ES designability measure in Equation 2 predicts that more designable\nstructures will exhibit many more stable sequences than less designable structures, this\nfinding lends some weight to the claim that ES has some bearing on the designability of\nreal proteins (67, 89). Although it is clear that there is no consensus in the field regarding\nthe applicability of Equation 2 to existing protein structures (47, 67, 89), the considerable\nsuccess of this measure for lattice proteins combined with burgeoning evidence from\nexisting protein structures at least provides some evidence that this geometric\n\n51\n\n\fmeasurement has the potential to capture much of the relevant designability signals from\nprotein structure.\nInfluence of Designability on Structural Evolution\nIn order to understand the combined influence of designability and divergence on\nthe evolution of protein sequences, Tiana and coworkers developed a 3-D lattice\nsimulation similar to the sequence-based divergent lattice algorithm discussed above (59,\n68, 90). In this case a seed sequence/structure pair is chosen to start the simulation, and\nduplication and divergence are employed to not only increase structural diversity but also\nsimulate the creation of paralogs and orthologs. This is achieved by allowing duplication\nand divergence that is constrained to a single structure (i.e. mutations are only accepted if\nthe same native state is chosen by the sequence) in addition to allowing mutations that\nchange the structure. The authors found that the structures produced by these divergent\nsimulations resulted in a striking increase in the designability over time. This increase\nwas measured using the trace of the 8th power of the contact matrix (the Tr(C8) term in\nEquation 2) and by direct verification of designability through sequence enumeration\n(90).\nThis very interesting observation implies that sequences starting from structures\nwith a given designability tend to \"migrate\" towards structures that are more designable.\nGiven the very nature of designability (i.e. the volume of sequence space corresponding\nto a given structure) this is perhaps not surprising: the simulation is simply more likely to\nfind stable, folding sequences for structures that are more designable. This is nonetheless\nan important observation that builds on the work of Taverna and Goldstein (59) in that it\nimplies that both designability and evolutionary dynamics may have a role to play in\n\n52\n\n\fexplaining protein evolution. Although the authors did not consider the topological\nfeatures of the structural space they generated in that particular piece of work (33, 66, 68,\n90), it is clearly possible to apply the graph theoretic description of the PDUG and LSG\nand its associated BB model to asses whether these simulations with increasing\ndesignability over time lead to model structural universes similar to the existing one.\nTo test the prediction that designability (as measured by the Tr(C8) parameter) is\nincreasing over time in real proteins, the authors compared the designability of all\neukaryotic-only domains from the PDUG to prokaryotic-only domains. They found a\nsignificant difference in the designability distribution: prokaryotic domains are, on\naverage, less designable than eukaryotic domains. From this they claimed that, since\nprokaryotic organisms are less complex and \"evolved before\" eukaryotic organisms,\ndesignability has been increasing over time for the real protein universe (90). It is\nimpossible, however, to argue that the prokaryotic organisms are a priori more\nstructurally basal than the eukaryotes simply based on the fact that the prokaryotic\ncellular organization most likely evolved before the eukaryotic one. Indeed, if we\nassume that a Least Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) exists for eukaryotes and\nprokaryotes, by definition the proteins specific to each lineage have been evolving\nseparately for exactly the same amount of time. Since there is no reason to believe that\nstructural innovation has proceeded more rapidly or has occurred on balance more\nrecently in the eukaryotic lineage it is difficult to claim that the difference in designability\nthe authors observed (90) is actually due to a tendency for proteins to increase in\ndesignability over time. More careful phylogenetic analysis (as discussed in the next\n\n53\n\n\fsection) may shed some light on this problem. This is not to say that the analysis is\nnecessarily incorrect; it is simply impossible to judge without much more careful study.\nDespite the limitations of the analysis mentioned above, further application of the\nES designability to real protein sequences and structures has provided clear evidence that\ndesignability has had at least measurable influence on sequence and structural evolution.\nShakhnovich, DeLisi and ourselves (91) recently demonstrated that the ES measure of\ndesignability (calculated in this case using the simply the contact density, or CD, based\non the first-order term in Equation 2) correlates very well (R2 = 0.9) with the logarithm of\nthe observed size of sequence families (Figure 10A). In this case families are defined in\nexactly the same way that nodes on the PDUG are defined: that is, a set of related\nsequences all of which (presumably) fold into very similar structures (i.e., structures with\nessentially the same contact maps and thus the same values of Tr(Cn)). Considering the\nstructural neighborhood of a given node (i.e. averaging over a set of neighbors on the\nPDUG) produces a similar correlation (Figurre 10B). These results indicate that, at least\non average, the geometric measure of designability represented by CD is a fairly good\npredictor of family size. CD is also a good measure of the functional flexibility of a\ndomain: the higher the CD, the more functions performed (on average) by the family of\nsequences.\nThe correlations mentioned above are calculated based on averages within sets of\ndomains that belong to either CD or family-size bins and are thus statistical in nature.\nWhen one looks at the raw correlation (without binning), the correlation drops to an R2 of\n0.09 (Figure 10C). This correlation is still very statistically significant, but it is clear that,\nfor an individual family, CD is not a terribly good predictor of family size. Assuming\n\n54\n\n\fFigure 10\n\nFigure 10. Influence of designability and evolutionary history on the size of folds and families, taken from\n(91). (A) The correlation between the log of the average family size for a given domain and the average\nCD of domain families within a certain bin in CD. The correlation in this case is very high (R2 of 0.9). (B)\nA plot similar to that in A, but in this case averages are taken over a structural neighborhood in the PDUG.\nThe correlation here is quite strong as well (R2 of 0.9). (C) Raw correlation of the CD of a protein domain\nwith the size of the particular domain family. Note the much weaker correlation (R2 of 0.09). (D) Raw\ncorrelation of familiy size with CD for only those protein domains that have a very high probability of\nexisting in the LUCA of all living organisms. In this case the raw correlation improves to an R2 of 0.16.\n\n55\n\n\fthat CD is itself a good measure of designability (as the strong correlation observed for\nthe averages might suggest), the question then turns to what other factors might be\ninfluencing family size. The results of both Taverna and Goldstein and Tiana and\ncolleagues (59, 90) suggest that evolutionary history might also play a role. To\ninvestigate this somewhat further, we calculated the correlation between (log) family size\nand CD for the most ancient set of domains as defined by conservation across all three\nkingdoms of life. In this case, if a domain could be assigned to any one oPDUG from\neach of the three kingdoms (eukarya, bacteria and archaea), then it is phylogenetically\nreasonable to assume that this particular domain was present in the Least Universal\nCommon Ancestor of all living organisms. These domains demonstrated statistically\nsignificantly higher CD values when compared to the entire set of domains in the PDUG,\na feature that might have resulted from the thermophilic lifestyle of the LUCA organism\n(89, 91). The family sizes of these domains were also statistically significantly larger,\nand the overall correlation between CD and family size within this set improves to an R2\nof 0.16 (Figure 10D). These results imply that both designability and evolutionary\nhistory impact family size: high designability denotes the potential for a large family but\nnatural history determines the extent to which that potential is explored (59, 90, 91).\nFrontiers\nThe exact role of designability in protein evolution remains very much an open\nquestion. Although designability was first suggested in the context of convergent\nevolution, it is clear from the results above that this concept is by no means incompatible\nwith divergent pictures of protein evolution. Theoretical explorations of lattice polymers\nhas demonstrated that designability has at least the potential to leave strong marks on the\n\n56\n\n\fcourse of structural evolution, and careful analysis of existing protein structures is\nbeginning to allow us to determine what those marks might be. Our understanding of this\nphenomenon is, however, far from exact, and there are several outstanding questions that\nremain regarding this venerable idea.\nOne clear issue has to do with the measurement of designability on the basis of\nstructural information. Despite the success of the ES designability definition in certain\nsituations, this is far from a solved problem. For one, it is unclear exactly which term in\nEquation 2 provides the most information. In maximally compact lattice structures, for\ninstance, the contact density (CD) is clearly exactly the same for all of the structures, a\nfact that does not prevent one from observing the important differences in designability\nbetween structures based on higher-order terms (32, 66, 67). In the study by Tiana et al.\n(90), the lattice proteins were not constrained to be maximally compact, and in this case\nthe authors found that CD decreases over time as the polymers become less compact, but\nover all designability (as based on the 8th term in the expansion) increases as evolution\nproceeds. The use of CD as a proxy for designability has yielded some interesting and\nimportant results (89, 91), but it is clear that much more exploration is needed before the\nconvincing claim can be made that CD is a sufficient measure for the designability of a\npolypeptide structure. Research on this and other structural measures of designability is\nongoing and can only lead to a more complete understanding of how differences in\nprotein structure influence the size and nature of the sequence pockets that fold into those\nstructures.\nUnderstanding the progression of structural features such as designability over\ntime for real proteins also requires a much more thorough understanding of the\n\n57\n\n\fphylogenetics of protein structure. This area of study, while it is discussed at some\nlength below, is still in its infancy, but it carries great promise. If one can build a\ncoherent natural history of protein domains, it becomes possible to carefully measure\nboth the changes in structure that have occurred over time (and thus determine to what\nextent designability has been increasing, decreasing or remaining stagnant) and also to\nobtain clues as to the size and extent of gene families that have been created around a\ngiven structure. Such studies should allow us to tease apart the influence of designability\nfrom the nature of divergent evolution and measure much more accurately how much of\nwhat we observe in the protein universe can be ascribed to this particular phenomenon.\n\nStructural Phylogeny\nProtein Structure and Phylogenetics\nMuch of the preceding discussion has focused on our attempts to understand the\nprogress of structural evolution at varying levels of detail. As our understanding of\nstructural evolution has progressed it has become clear that protein structural evolution,\nwhile an interesting question in its own right, may have some light to shed on the\nevolution of organisms themselves. As mentioned above, structural innovation certainly\nhas important potential consequences for the space of possible functions available to an\norganism, and indeed one of the remaining challenges in structural evolution is\nunderstanding and quantifying this impact. Protein structure may also shed light on\nanother important question in evolution: that of phylogenetic relationships.\nAn enormous amount of work has been done aimed at elucidating the phylogenies\nof existing and extinct organisms. In order to construct a phylogeny, one must rely on\nsome measure of the similarity between two species coupled with the concept that\n\n58\n\n\forganisms exhibiting a greater degree of similarity are likely to be more closely related to\none another than organisms display a lesser degree of similarity. Most of these similarity\nmeasures are based on a set of observables that describe an organism (called the\n\"characters\" of that organism) and calculate evolutionary relatedness on the basis of\nsimilarity in lists of these characters. Before the advent of molecular techniques these\ncharacters were morphological in nature (92), that is, they relied on direct observations of\nthe external or internal features of an organism. Such observations are still employed\nwith great success today, but the introduction of molecular characters to the phylogenetic\narsenal has revolutionized the study of evolutionary relationships (92-97). These\nmolecular characters are especially important for the study of prokaryotic and microbial\nphylogeny since the number of available morphological characters for these organisms is\nsmall and often misleading.\nThe most oft-invoked molecular character was first suggested by Carl Woese and\nis based on the sequence of the ribosomal RNA of the small subunit of the ribosome (93,\n94, 98). In this case the \"structure\" that is used for molecular morphology is the primary\nsequence of nucleotides in the molecule. Analysis of the small subunit rRNA (SSU\nrRNA) relationships provided some of the first evidence for the division of living\norganisms into three kingdoms of life (bacteria, eukarya and archaea) rather than two\n(prokarya and eukarya) (93-95). Indeed, this now well-accepted shift in phylogenetic\ncategorization highlights the profound utility of molecular phylogeny: bacteria and\narchaea look very similar to one another if all one has at one's disposal is a set of\ncharacters one can observe in a microscope. Although molecular phylogeny has been\ndominated in many ways by the SSU rRNA, it is clear that phylogenetic signals may be\n\n59\n\n\fderived from the primary structure of many genes and proteins (97). These methods rely\non two (perhaps complimentary) approaches: direct sequence comparisons and gene\ncontent comparisons. The former involves computing sequence alignments and\ncalculating distance on the basis of sequence overlap and is the method employed in\nconstructing the rRNA phylogeny. The latter relies on definitions of orthologs (i.e.\nClusters of Orthologous Groups, COGs) (99) and calculates distance based on the extent\nof shared orthologs. As mentioned above direct sequence comparisons are often based on\na single gene like the SSU rRNA, but in some cases multiple genes are compared to one\nanother to create a composite distance (100). Both methods exhibit certain systematic\nproblems that have kept the question of prokaryotic phylogeny from being considered\ntruly solved at this juncture.\nSequence comparisons exhibit a number of difficulties that revolve around the\nfact that the number of positions within a given sequence that can actually vary is fairly\nlimited, and the number of sequence values that can be observed at any given position is\nalso fairly limited (especially in the case of nucleotide sequences). Thus, on long time\nscales, repetitions of sequence values can be observed that obscure phylogenetic distance\nand thus interfere with phylogenetic signals (96). Although this is certainly a potential\nissue both with the rRNA trees and gene-sequence-based trees (100), perhaps more\nproblematic is the influence of Lateral Gene Transfer (LGT, also referred to as Horizontal\nGene Transfer or HGT) (75-78, 97, 101-104). LGT is a mechanism whereby genetic\nmaterial is transferred from one lineage to another. This process, when it occurs between\ntwo organisms that are separated by an appreciable evolutionary distance, obscures\nphylogenetic signals because it leads to genetic similarity through a mechanism other\n\n60\n\n\fthan descent. The influence of LGT on both sequence-based characters and on the\ndistribution of genes (COGs) has been considerable (75, 76), a fact that is perhaps best\nevidenced by the finding that many gene-specific trees differ greatly from one another\nand from the rRNA tree (97, 100, 101, 105-108). It has been proposed that the genetic\ncontent of some organisms, like the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima,\ncontain on the order of 20-25% LGT genes (78, 102). Observations such as these have\nlead to the proposal that a reliable phylogeny cannot be defined for prokaryotic\norganisms and a \"web of life,\" rather than a tree, represents the more appropriate picture\n(75-77).\nAlthough some researchers have worked to minimize or remove the influence of\nLGT on their gene-based phylogenies using various methods (100, 109, 110), these\nmethods are fraught with difficulty. Selective pruning of a dataset to concentrate on a\n\"privileged\" set of genes that are less likely to be transferred (100, 111), such as genes\ninvolved in the processing of genetic information, has met with some success, but in\nthese cases it is difficult to demonstrate a priori which genes are the most advantageous\nto use and the results are often highly sensitive to the specific set of genes that are\nchosen. Dutilh and coworkers recently attempted to self-consistently determine a set of\nthese \"core\" genes by iteratively removing COGs from their dataset that did not agree\nwith the overall phylogeny implied by all characters (109). Although this procedure does\nconverge to a particular tree and gene set, over 70% of COGs are discarded during the\nprocess and it is unclear to what extent small changes in the method through which the\ntree is built and phylogenetic inconsistency of a given COG is determined might\ninfluence the results.\n\n61\n\n\fAs hinted above, the distributions of protein structures in living organisms\nrepresents a potentially interesting source of phylogenetic information that is distinct\nfrom gene sequence and content and thus may not suffer from the inherent difficulties of\nthese data sets. Perhaps the most important inherent advantage of structural information\nis that structural innovation is likely a very slow process and as such can provide a wealth\nof information about the ancient, \"deep\" branches of the tree of life. The emergence of a\nnew type of protein structure quite obviously occurs on much longer time scales than\nmicroscopic sequence changes. Likewise, the discovery of a new gene can occur simply\nthrough the reorganization and recombination of existing structural domains and is thus\nlikely to occur at a much higher frequency than true structural innovation. The above\nobservations indicate that the transfer of a gene via LGT is not guaranteed to involve the\ntransfer of a new structural domain from the donor lineage to the acceptor lineage. The\nslower pace of structural innovation guarantees that two organisms are likely to be more\nstructurally similar than genetically similar across any given evolutionary distance, and\nso the probability of transferring a new domain via LGT is clearly much lower than the\nprobability of transferring a new gene. Although LGT could certainly result in a\nstructural content change for the acceptor organism, a priori it is unclear to what extent\nthis process has interfered with the structural signal. These potential advantages that\nderive from considering the protein structural characters of an organism have\nunderpinned a number of attempts to use structural information to construct phylogenies.\nBuilding Structural Phylogenies\nEarly work on structural phylogeny revolved around comparing the fold content\nof various organisms. The first attempt at this was made by Koonin and coworkers as\n\n62\n\n\fpart of an effort to classify structural domains into the three kingdoms of life (79). The\nphylogeny they produced as part of this work involved only a very few taxa, and the\nphylogeny suggested by their data at that time was not terribly reasonable. Later, Lin and\nGerstein extended this work by employing an increased number of available structures to\nan increased number of taxa. Despite this improvement, however, the phylogenies\nproduced by a variety of methods from the fold-content dataset were also somewhat\nunreasonable and did not agree in many basic ways with much of the other sources of\nphylogenetic signals available at the time (112). A similar study in 2003 by CaetanoAnoll\u00e9s and Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s recovered the Eukaryote/Bacteria/Archaea organization but\ndid not discriminate well the overall organization of taxa within the domains themselves\n(113). The mediocre performance of structural characters in these studies most likely\nresults from the fact that the \"fold\" level of structural classification is too coarse-grained\nto provide many benefits over gene sequence-or content-based datasets. For instance,\ntwo organisms may actually share very few domains but, since they have at least one\n(separate) representative from the same set of folds, exhibit perfect overlap at the fold\nlevel. The fact that there are fairly few folds that had (or have) been described (6),\ncombined with the observation that many of these folds are very widely conserved (6, 79,\n80), indicates that fold innovation may be too slow and thus contain few useable\nphylogenetic signals. It is important to note that this earlier work on structural phylogeny\ninvolved very few taxa, so it is possible that the difficulties encountered in those studies\nwere the result not only of the very coarse-grained nature of the fold description but also\nthe limited taxon sampling available at the time (79, 112, 113).\n\n63\n\n\fMore recent and (arguably) more successful phylogenies have been built on the\nbasis of protein structural domains as the fundamental set of characters. One of the\nclearest advantages of structural domains is that they represent specific sequencestructure pairs and are very unlikely to have ever evolved convergently. Current\ntheoretical models of domain evolution also provide an important and unprecedented\nadvantage to this particular data set. All methods for phylogenetic reconstruction have at\ntheir core a set of assumptions and algorithms that allow one to translate similarity in\nsome set of characters into evolutionary distances. Oftentimes one chooses these\nalgorithms on the basis of how \"reasonable\" they seem for the set of characters in\nquestion and how computationally intensive they are. In the case of structural domains,\nhowever, it is possible to start from an independently testable model of the evolution of\nthose characters and attempt to translate that model into a phylogenetic method (or set of\nmethods) that most closely correspond to the nature and assumptions of that model.\nThe clearest example of this difference has to do with understanding the\nprevalence of LGT. In the speciation model of structural evolution discussed in the\nstructural proteome section above, transfer of domains between one lineage and another\nnever occurs (74). This model reproduces the observation that structural proteomes are\nhighly non-random subsets of the PDUG. When one looks at the structure of this model,\nit becomes apparent that the partitioning of the graph into specific proteomes that do not\nintermingle is basically the cause of this behavior-in a sense, each lineage-specific\nPDUG is a separate, small universe of its own. Lateral Structural Domain Transfer\n(LSDT) resulting from LGT in a sense mimics convergent node discovery, and as such\nthis result points to the working hypothesis that LSDT might not have been widespread in\n\n64\n\n\fall lineages. Indeed, when a variety of LSDT mechanisms are implemented into the\nevolutionary model, they tend to increase the probability that model organismal\nsubgraphs are random subsets of their model structural universe (74, 114). Although\nthese results certainly in no way constitute proof that LSDT has been rare, they point to a\nparticular set of phylogenetic methods that are more consistent with this finding. Given\nthat no analogue of the PDUG exists for sequence- or gene-based characters, this type of\nanalysis is currently limited to structural information.\nThe method that is perhaps most consistent with these structural evolution models\nis known as Dollo parsimony (115, 116). Methods that are based on Maximum\nParsimony (MP) build trees by modeling the gain, loss, and transformation of characters\nat different internal nodes on the tree. For a certain tree topology, the most reasonable\nevolutionary scenario is considered to be the one in which the fewest events are necessary\nto explain the existing distribution of characters (117). The best topology is then also\ntaken to be the one that requires the fewest events in its \"best-case\" scenario. There are a\nvariety of MP methods available (97, 112, 116, 117), and as mentioned above the most\nreasonable method for structural domains (based on the assumption that convergent\ndiscovery of domains and LSDT are both very infrequent) is Dollo. This type of\nparsimony involves a constraint (called the Dollo constraint) that prevents \"reversions\"\non a tree. This means that any time a lineage looses a particular character (i.e. a\nparticular domain), it cannot be rediscovered at a later point in that lineage. This\nstipulation effectively ensures that every single character on the tree is monophyletic, that\nis, has only one point of origin in the phylogeny (115, 116). This is in contrast to\n\"unconstrained\" MP methods that allow for any degree of homoplasy-that is, methods\n\n65\n\n\fthat allow for the loss and gain of a particular character at will. Analysis of these two\nmethods clearly indicates that Dollo is the more reasonable assumption in the light of\ncurrent structural evolution models; in fact, in the limit where those models represent an\nexact picture of structural evolution the Dollo tree will represent an exact solution of the\nphylogenetic problem (74, 114).\nStarting with the structural proteomes consisting of PDUG domains as described\nabove (33, 74, 81, 114), we built a prokaryotic phylogeny on the basis of both MP\nmethods. The Dollo constraint provided a remarkably reasonable phylogeny that, on\nbalance, supported many of the major groupings indicated by the rRNA phylogeny and\nvarious other molecular methods (97, 114). In some cases where the Dollo phylogeny\ndiffers from \"canonical\" groupings well supported by other methods, the source of\ndifficulty was clear: a greater probability that the oPDUG is a random subgraph of the\nPDUG. For instance, in the Dollo tree both Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter\npylori are moved from their traditional placement in the proteobacterial clade to a\nposition near the base of the tree along with the cyanobacteria (97, 114). These\nproteomes, however, have among the highest probabilities of being random subgraphs\nwithin the dataset we employed, and it is clear that this degree of randomness interferes\nwith the phylogenetic signal. This observation highlights the utility of our domain-based\napproach as we were able to identify a source of difficulty in the placement of these\norganisms in this and perhaps other phylogenies (114). Other non-traditional groupings\nthat are observed in the Dollo tree, however, occurred with proteomes that have a low\nprobability of being random. The grouping of T. maritima with Thermoanaerobacter\ntengcongensis in the gram-positive clade is one example. In this case the lack of\n\n66\n\n\frandomness indicates that the structural signal may be contributing signals that are\ndifficult to obtain from other datasets and represent potentially important phylogenetic\nhypotheses that warrant further study.\nWhen we employed unconstrained parsimony, however, the results were not as\nreasonable as those obtained using the Dollo method. Although there was some\ncorrespondence between the trees produced by both methods, the unconstrained method\nsplits the gram-positive clade of bacteria and asserts that the high G+C subset of this\nclade is actually more closely related to the proteobacteria than to the remainder of the\ngram positives. Such a grouping is very rare in other phylogenetic methodologies and is\nsimply less phylogenetically reasonable (97, 100, 101, 105-107, 114), providing a\nmeasure of phylogenetic support for the claim that LSDT has played a minor role in the\nevolution of structural proteomes and the Dollo constraint is necessary to elicit a good\nphylogenetic signal from structural characters using MP.\nAnother method that is consistent with current theoretical models is the Neighbor\nJoining (NJ) method (116, 118). This method uses a calculated distance between each\npair of taxa to build the tree; in the structural case this distance is just the number of\ncharacters in which the organisms differ (also referred to as the \"Hamming Distance\" in\nthe sequence of descriptors (112)). Although the NJ algorithm does not explicitly prevent\nconvergence or LSDT as in the case of Dollo parsimony, in the limit where current\nmodels of structural evolution are exact the distance-based NJ method should give results\nroughly equivalent to those obtained from Dollo parsimony. This method does indeed\nproduce a phylogeny that is very similar to that based on Dollo parsimony, although in\n\n67\n\n\fthis case the statistical support for some of the \"important\" internal nodes is less strong\nthan in the Dollo tree (114).\nMany of the conclusions of our work summarized above were recently confirmed\nby the work of Bourne and coworkers (119) based on domains classified in SCOP rather\nthan on FSSP domains represented by the PDUG. These authors employed a single\nphylogenetic method (NJ) and could not make statements about the randomness of\nproteomes given that the SCOP database lacks an analog of the PDUG from which Pvalues can be calculated. Bourne and coworkers benefited, however, from a larger set of\ntaxa, which allowed them to expand their analysis to include eukaryotes in addition to\nbacteria and archaea. Close comparison of their bacterial tree and ours reveals almost\nperfect agreement, which, given the similarity in datasets, is not surprising (114, 119).\nFor instance, their tree places H. pylori and C. jejuni with the cyanobacteria outside of the\nproteobacterial clade and T. maritima with T. tengcongensis as is seen in our Dollo and\nNJ trees.\nOne interesting question that arises in analysis of the above work involves\nunderstanding exactly why protein structural domains are less likely to be influenced by\nlateral gene transfer (as evidenced by phylogenetic \"success\" of two completely\nindependent methods based on unpruned datasets). At least in the bacterial clade, part of\nthe success may simply derive from the fact that the domain overlap of even\nphylogenetically distant organisms is considerable-in the case of Escherichia coli and\nBacillus subtilis, for instance, 873 of the 959 domains from B. subtilis are shared between\nthe two organisms (74). This finding implies that an LGT event over a considerable\nevolutionary distance has a fairly low probability (~10% if domains are sampled equally)\n\n68\n\n\fof resulting in a change in the structural content of either organism. Consistent with this\npicture, Bourne and coworkers found that consideration of the abundance of domains,\nrather than just the presence or absence of structural information, provided phylogenies\nof much lower quality (119). Although the authors attribute this fact to gene duplication\nmechanisms, it is far more likely to be a reflection of the influence of LGT. LGT events\nthat do not result in the transfer of new structural domains to the acceptor lineage will, by\ndefinition, only influence the abundance of existing domains and thus the widespread\ninfluence of LGT observed in gene-based phylogenies will be recapitulated in that kind\nof structural dataset.\nThe results presented above also provided further evidence that a great deal of\nstructural information is widely conserved even among the three kingdoms of life (79,\n112, 119). Given the large number of structural domains that are very ancient, it is\ninteresting to speculate on the tenor of structural evolution that predated the true LUCA\nof all cellular life. Although the inherent lack of phylogenetic information before this\npoint makes study of this process inherently difficult, analysis of the results discussed\nabove has some surprising implications. For instance, the number and diversity of\ndomains that likely existed in the LUCA organism indicates that this organism is likely to\nhave been surprisingly structurally sophisticated. All major classes of protein structure\n(all-\u03b1, all-\u03b2, \u03b1+\u03b2 and \u03b1/\u03b2) are represented in this set. Given the short period of time in\nwhich life evolved before the split of the three kingdoms (perhaps 500 million years or\nso), it is clear that the rate of structural innovation in this time period was quite\nconsiderable. Understanding the nature of structural evolution in these early stages, and\nthe mechanisms or conditions that might have separated it from the ensuing structural\n\n69\n\n\fevolution observed within each of the three kingdoms, is an intriguing question that\nrequires a great deal of further study.\nFrontiers\nThe promise of structural phylogeny is, as yet, largely unrealized for a variety of\nreasons. Foremost among these is the fact that experimental exploration of the evolved\nstructural universe is paltry compared to sequence exploration (6, 21, 24, 120). Although\nit has been claimed that that about 50% of \"existing\" sequences exhibit sequence\nhomology with structures that have been characterized (80), this is a very difficult\nstatement to interpret. Despite the growing number of fully-sequenced genomes, it is\nclear that our taxon sampling even on the sequence level is nowhere near complete,\nespecially within the bacterial and archaeal kingdoms where there are many species that\nhave not been cultured and are known only by a single 16S rRNA sequence. If and when\nsome appreciable fraction of this organismal diversity has been sampled in the set of fully\nsequenced genomes, it will be possible to more accurately asses to what extent our\nexploration of the structural universe is complete at the domain level. Regardless of this\nfact, the structural information employed in the phylogenetic work described above is by\nno means a complete set. This lack of completeness may also lead to biases in this\ncharacter set that may impact the phylogeny, especially within the archaeal kingdom\nwhere structural coverage is fairly low and exact relationships are thus difficult to\ndetermine (114, 119). Structural genomics projects may alleviate some of these\ndifficulties by providing at least a few glimpses at structural proteomes that are as\nunbiased as possible, but a great deal of structure determination will be necessary to\nprovide a higher-quality dataset from which to build structural phylogenies. As the\n\n70\n\n\fcharacters currently stand, they could still provide a great deal of further information\ntowards the phylogenetic effort, especially if combined with other types of data in a\nhybrid approach.\nGiven that domain-based structural characters have proven somewhat reliable in\nphylogenetic reconstructions, it is now possible to consider building a natural history of\nstructural domains on the basis of the species tree (114, 117, 119). If successful and\nreasonable, such efforts could provide an immeasurable amount of information about the\nevolution of protein structures and allow for the detailed testing of evolutionary models.\nThe main difficulty with this particular line of inquiry is that the results are highly\ndependent on the topology of the tree itself (for which no consensus exists) and on the\nassumptions that describe the evolution of the characters (117). Both of these problems\ncan be overcome by considering a \"self-consistent\" approach where structural\ninformation is used to build the (evolutionarily reasonable) tree itself. This effort should\nmove our understanding of structural evolution beyond the simple considerations of\nwidespread conservation (79, 80, 112, 119). As our picture of the natural history of\ndomains themselves improves, more accurate models of structural evolution may be\nposed and tested against the features of that natural history. In essence this may produce\na feedback cycle in which ever-more reasonable pictures of structural evolution inform\never-more accurate phylogenetic scenarios.\n\nConclusions\nProtein structural evolution is a fascinating subject and has been the object of\nintense study ever since it became clear that proteins had specific structures that could be\nspecified on the basis of sequence alone. The intense pace of structural biology and the\n\n71\n\n\fcorresponding explosion in structural information has supported much of the work\noutlined above, and as mentioned earlier it is clear that further structural exploration,\nespecially from structural genomics projects, will only increase the precision with which\nquantitative statements about structural evolution may be made. Despite the volume of\nwork that has been poured into the question of protein structural evolution and the\nnumber of researchers who have contributed to developing the structure-centric view\noutlined in this chapter, this work has allowed the community to pose an increasingly\ndetailed set of questions. Answering these questions (some of which were posed in the\n\"Frontiers\" sections above) will require intense theoretical work, deep evolutionary\nthinking, and most of all sustained experimental effort to provide the greatest amount of\nstructural information possible.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors thank Dr. Eugene Koonin, Dr. Nikolay Dokholyan, and C.
