The consequences of model dependence for vector singlets and vector doublets are\nstudied. Distributions are calculated including hadronization effects and\nexperimental cuts that suppress the standard model background. The\nfinal state leptonic energy distributions are shown to give a very clear\nsignature for heavy charged leptons.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe possibility of new heavy charged leptons is present in many extentions of\nthe Standard Model (SM). In grand unified theories beyond SU(5) we have\nnew fermionic fields [1]. In superstring theories with an E6 gauge group after\ncompactification, the fermions in the fundamental 27 representation have new\nleptonic doublets [2] and new neutral lepton singlets [3]. In left-right symmetric\nmodels [4] we have also new mirror fermions that are expected to be much\nheavier than the presently known fermions from the SM. Extended electroweak\ngauge groups with three anomaly free families [5] contain new fermions. We can\nalso have a new fourth family, similar to the electron-muon-tau families, but\nwith much higher mass states.\nIt is well known that experimentally no clear signal of such fermions was\nfound so far [6]. If these particles exist, the latest experimental limits imply\nthat they must have a mass greater than 100 GeV. However, the possibility\nof generalizing the SM into a deeper model is a strong motivation for both\nexperimental searches at the next colliders as well as for theoretical studies.\nThe recent experimental confirmation of light neutrino masses and oscillations\n[7] also raises the question of new possible heavy neutral leptons. These neutral\n1\n\n\fheavy leptons could be responsible for the see-saw mechanism for small neutrino\nmasses. As the presently known leptons appear in neutral and charged states,\nit is reasonable to suppose that new heavy states will show the same behavior.\nThe new heavy charged leptons could be searched for in future high energy\nhadron-hadron colliders [8], lepton-hadron colliders [9], lepton-lepton colliders\n[10] and photon-electron [11] colliders. In this\n\u221a paper we will concentrate our\nattention on the electron-positron option at s = 500 GeV. This will be the\nfirst energy option for the linear collider at NLC [12] as well as for the TESLA\n[13] project at DESY before they move to higher center of mass energies and\nluminosities. Most of our results can be scaled for higher energy options. We\nhave considered an yearly integrated luminosity of L = 105 pb\u22121 .\nThe new heavy charged and neutral leptons have been studied intensively\nby many authors [1,\u221a2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16] For heavy lepton\nmasses up to ML = s/2 the total cross section is dominated by pair production\ndue to photon exchange. So this mechanism\u221ais quite model\n\u221a independent. We\ncan extend the heavy lepton mass range to s > ML > s/2 by looking for\nsingle heavy lepton production. In this case, and also in the decay of heavy\nleptons, there is a strong model dependence on the mixing between light and\nheavy leptons as well as in the heavy-to-heavy lepton couplings.\nIn the present work we study the dynamical and kinematical properties for\nproduction and also for the decay of new heavy charged leptons into presently\nknown particles. These distributions are compared with the expected background coming from the SM and we show how the signal can be clearly separated\nfrom the background with a great significance, independent of hadronization effects. Another point discussed is the model dependence for new heavy charged\nlepton experimental search.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we discuss the models adopted\nand their parameters. In section 3 we present the results from the various processes involving heavy leptons, studied in this paper, comparing the distributions from SM, vector singlet model (VSM) and vector doublet model (VDM).\nFinally, conclusions are shown in section 4.\n\n2\n\nThe models\n\nThe high precision data on the SM parameters imply strong limits on new heavy\n\u221a\ngauge bosons. So, our first hypothesis is that in the next e\u2212 e+ collider at s =\n500 GeV the mechanism for production and decay of new heavy charged leptons\nwill be dominated by the presently known electroweak gauge bosons. The second\nhypothesis is that the new heavy leptons can mix with the light leptons in each\nfamily. The mixing angle parameters are constrained by the Z properties and by\nasymmetries in lepton-lepton scattering. They imply a small mixing [14], of the\norder of sin2 \u03b8mix < 0.005 with 95% c.l. Throughout this paper we will consider\ne\n\u03bd\nall mixing angles (\u03b8L,R\nand \u03b8L,R\n) between the new and the ordinary leptons\n(charged and neutral) equal to the present upper bound sin2 \u03b8mix = 0.005. The\nnext theoretical point concerns the quantum numbers that can be assigned to\n2\n\n\fTable 1: Vector\nas a Dirac field\nVertice\nZ \u2192 e+ e\u2212\nZ \u2192 \u03bde \u03bd\u0304e\nZ \u2192 e+ L \u2212\ne\nZ \u2192 \u03bde N\u0304\nZ \u2192 N N\u0304\n\u2212\nZ \u2192 L+\ne Le\nW + \u2192 \u03bde e +\nW + \u2192 N\u0304 e+\nW + \u2192 \u03bde L +\ne\nW + \u2192 N L+\ne\n\nsinglet model couplings between bosons and fermions with N\ngV\ne\n\u2212 cos2 \u03b8L\n+ 4s2W\n2 \u03bd\ncos \u03b8L\ne\ne\n\u2212 cos \u03b8L\nsin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\ncos \u03b8L sin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\nsin2 \u03b8L\n2 e\n\u2212 sin \u03b8L + 4s2W\n\u03bd\ne\ncos \u03b8L\ncos \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\nsin \u03b8L cos \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\ncos \u03b8L\nsin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\nsin \u03b8L sin \u03b8L\n\ngA\ne\n\u2212 cos2 \u03b8L\n2 \u03bd\ncos \u03b8L\ne\ne\n\u2212 cos \u03b8L\nsin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\ncos \u03b8L sin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\nsin2 \u03b8L\n2 e\n\u2212 sin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\ncos \u03b8L\ncos \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\nsin \u03b8L cos \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\ncos \u03b8L\nsin \u03b8L\n\u03bd\ne\nsin \u03b8L sin \u03b8L\n\nnew heavy leptons. Here we have a number of possibilities, but we will restrict\nour analysis to only two models: new vector singlets and new vector doublets.\nFor the VSM the new charged heavy lepton (written as L) is a singlet, as well\nas the new neutral lepton (written as N). For the VDM both new heavy leptons\nare placed in doublets. There are other possible models for new heavy leptons\nsuch as mirror and fourth generation models. We have restricted our analysis\nto the VDM and VSM since they give the more important features of model\ndependence with fewer parameters than other models.\nThe interactions are then given by the Lagrangians for neutral and charged\ncurrents:\nLcn = \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng\nij\n\u03b35 \u03c8j + h.c.\nZ\u03bc \u03c8i \u03b3 \u03bc gVij \u2212 gA\n4cW\n\n(1)\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\ng\nij\nLcc = \u2212 \u221a W\u03bc \u03c8i \u03b3 \u03bc gVij \u2212 gA\n(2)\n\u03b35 \u03c8j + h.c.\n2 2\nwhere i and j are the possible combinations of light and heavy leptons. The\ncouplings depend on mixing parameters that are given in table 1 for the VSM,\nand in table 2 for the VDM. In the next section we will discuss the role of heavy\nneutrinos in the heavy charged lepton decays. In tables 1 and 2, we present\nthe couplings for the case of new heavy neutrino states of the Dirac type. In\nthis case a global family symmetry is present and no lepton number violation\noccurs.\n\nThe heavy neutrinos could also be of the Majorana type.

In the Majorana case, we\nhave the possibility that heavy charged lepton decays could also violate lepton\nnumber conservation [15] due to the chain,\nLi \u2212\u2192\n\nNW\n|\n\u2212\u2192 l\u00b1 W \u2213\n\n(3)\n\nwhere l, i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 , so that the cross sections are the same for dilepton final\nstates of the type e\u2212 e+ \u2212\u2192 e\u00b1 + l\u2213 + W \u00b1 + W \u2213 .\nIn all calculations presented in this paper we have considered N as a heavy\nMajorana neutrino that couples to all families, with mass MN = 100 GeV.\nWe are assuming the heavy neutral lepton mass to be smaller than the heavy\ncharged lepton mass as in the light lepton mass spectrum for the three known\nlepton families.\nFor simplicity we have concentrated on the first (electron) family and our\nresults can be generalized to the other families.\n\n3\n\nResults\n\nIn this section we present the main channels, cross sections and distributions,\ncomparing the signal from VSM and VDM and the SM background. This procedure allow us to obtain a clear signature for heavy charged leptons. As many\nof these processes involve a large number of diagrams, we have employed the\nCalcHep [17] package. The VSM and VDM were implemented in the unitary\n4\n\n\fand Feynman gauges and both results were carefully checked and compared.\nSo, the results here presented are complete first order calculations.\nIn Figs. 1a and 1b we give the total and partial widths for heavy charged\nlepton decay as a function of its mass. The enhancement for the VDM model,\nshown in Fig. 1a, comes from the heavy-to-heavy transition in the channel\nLe \u2212\u2192 N W as shown in Fig 1b and it starts when MLe = MN + MW . This\nchannel is suppressed in the VSM due to the sin2 \u03b8mix factor that is present in\nthe W \u2212 L \u2212 N vertex, as shown in the last line of table 1. For the VDM, the\ncorresponding term is maximum for this vertex, as shown in table 2, strongly\nsuppressing the decays Le \u2212\u2192 e+Z and Le \u2212\u2192 \u03bde +W . Of course, if the neutral\nheavy lepton mass increases, this effect is smaller. We can have important model\ndependence for the signatures of charged heavy lepton decays.\nFor pair production of heavy charged leptons we have three diagrams, but\nthe result is \u221a\ndominated by photon exchange. This is the leading process for\nmasses up to s/2. The\n\u221a single heavy lepton production gives a significative cross\nsection for masses > s/2 and depends strongly on the mixing parameters. The\ncorresponding total cross sections for real pair and single charged heavy lepton\nproduction are given in Fig. 2. Both the VDM and the VSM give the same\nresults. In order to improve our calculations as close as possible to experimental\nsituations, we have employed the following detector cuts for final state particles:\na minimum 5 GeV energy cut for all final leptons; an angular cut |cos \u03b8| \u2265 0.995\nfor all particles, except for the final gauge bosons, relative to the initial electron\nbeam direction and an invariant electron-positron mass cut \u2265 5 GeV.\nFor single heavy lepton production one can easily compute cross sections\nfor the three particle final states eeZ and \u03bdeW by multiplying the results of\nFig. 2 by the corresponding branching fractions. As we are mainly interested\nin comparing different signatures with the SM background, we have performed\nthe full first order calculation. The Feynman diagrams for the signal are given\nin Figs. 3a and 3b. We notice that in Fig. 3a, each diagram appears twice. For\nthe SM background we have sixteen diagrams for the first channel and twelve\ndiagrams for the second. This procedure of including all diagrams, allows us to\nhave a reliable result not only for cross sections but also for final state particle\ndistributions [16]. These large number of diagrams can be taken into account by\nemploying high energy algebraic programs, such as CalcHep [17]. The resulting\ncross sections as a function of ML for the processes e\u2212 + e+ \u2212\u2192 e\u00b1 + e\u2213 + Z\nand e+ + e\u2212 \u2212\u2192 e+ (e\u2212 ) + \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + W \u2212 (W + ) are shown in Figs 4a and 4b.\nThe curves labeled VDM and VSM correspond to the signal terms only. The\nfirst channel has only the charged heavy lepton signal (with both charges) but\nthe second channel has both neutral and charged heavy leptons (with only one\ncharge) contributions, as shown by Figs. 3a and 3b. We show in Fig. 4b\nthe role of the heavy neutrino contribution to the signal total cross section, by\ncomputing separately the heavy charged lepton contribution only. Since the\ndominant process is the real production of heavy leptons, our results are gauge\ninvariant. These are the main signatures for a single heavy charged lepton with\nmass in the 250 \u2212 500 GeV range.\nFor pair production with masses in the 100 \u2212 250 GeV range we must look\n5\n\n\f10 3\nVDM\n\n10 2\n\n10 0\n\nFigure 1a\n\n\u0393(GeV)\n\n10 1\nVSM\n\n10 -1\n10 -2\n10 -3\n\nM N = 100 GeV\n\n10 -4\n100\n\n400\n\n700\n\n1000\n\nM Le (GeV)\n\n10 3\n10 2\n\nM N = 100 GeV\n\nN W (VDM)\n\n10 0\n\n\u03bd e W (VSM = VDM)\n\n10 -1\n10 -2\n\ne Z (VSM = VDM)\n\nFigure 1b\n\nPartial width (GeV)\n\n10 1\n\n10 -3\n10 -4\n10 -5\n100\n\nN W (VSM)\n\n6\n170\n\n240\n310\nM Le (GeV)\n\n380\n\n450\n\nFigure 1: Total heavy lepton width (1a) and partial widths (1b) for VSM and\n\n\f10 0\nL e+ + L e-\n\ne\n\n+\n\nFigure 2\n\n\u03c3(pb)\n\n10 -1\n\n+ L e-\n\n10 -2\n\n10 -3\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\nM Le (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: Total\n\u221a cross section for single and pair production of heavy leptons in\ne\u2212 + e+ at s = 500 GeV (sin2 \u03b8mix = 0.0052) for VSM and VDM.\n\n7\n\n\f8\nFigure 3: General Feynman graphs for charged heavy lepton contribution in\ne\u2212 + e+ \u2212\u2192 e\u00b1 + e\u2213 + Z (3a) (8 dominant diagrams) and e\u2212 + e+ \u2212\u2192 e+ +\n\u03bde + W \u2212 (3b) (6 dominant diagrams) with MN = 100 GeV.\n\n\fe- + e + \u2192 e - + e + + Z\n10 0\nSM\n10 -1\n\nVSM\nFigure 4a\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\n10 -2\n\n10 -3\n\n10 -4\nVDM\n10 -5\n\n10 -6\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nM Le (GeV)\n\ne- + e + \u2192 \u03bd e + e + + W\n\n-\n\n10 1\nM N = 100 GeV\n\nSM\n10 0\n\nVSM (N+L e)\nVDM (N + L\n\n10 -2\n\ne\n\nFgirue 4b\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\n10 -1\n\n)\n\nVSM (L e)\n\n10 -3\nVDM( L e)\n\n10 -4\n\n10 -5\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\nM Le (GeV)\n\n+\nFigure 4: Total cross sections for e\u2212 + e\u221a\n\u2212\u2192 e\u00b1 + e\u2213 + Z (4a) and e\u2212 + e+ \u2212\u2192\n+ \u2212\n\u2212\n+\ne (e ) + \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + W (W ) (4b) at s = 500 GeV with MN = 100 GeV.\nIn fig. 4b we have separated the pure 9signal N + Le from the pure signal Le\ncontributions.\n\n\fe+ + e - + Z + Z\ne - + \u03bd e+ W + + Z\n10 0\nVDM\n10 -1\n\nVSM\n\n10\n\nVSM\n\n-2\n\nFigure 5\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\nVDM\n\nSM\n10 -3\n\n10 -4\n\nSM\nM N = 100 GeV\n\n10 -5\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nM Le (GeV)\n\n+\n\u00b1\n\u2213\n+\n\u2212\nFigure 5: Total cross sections for e\u2212 +\n\u221ae \u2212\u2192 e + e + Z + Z and e + e \u2212\u2192\ne+ (e\u2212 ) + \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + W \u2212 (W + ) + Z at s = 500 GeV with MN = 100 GeV.\n\nfor final states with four particles.

The curves labeled VSM and VDM, include only the signal\nfrom heavy neutral and charged leptons. We notice that the signal is above the\nSM. For the VDM model and MN = 100 GeV, the contribution of new heavy\nleptons to the total cross section is the same as in the VSM up to the region\nMLe = MN + MW . Then the dominant decay mode is Le \u2212\u2192 N + W and the\nother channels become suppressed.\nIn the experimental search for heavy charged leptons a fundamental point is\nthe choice of distributions that can enhance the signal from the SM background.\nA simple distribution is the final state invariant mass MeZ , as shown in Fig. 6\nfor the e\u2212 e+ Z channel, for the complete VSM extension (signal + background).\nThis distribution requires the experimental reconstruction of the Z hadronic\njets. There are intrinsic difficulties and uncertainties in the experimental and\ntheoretical reconstruction of hadronic events.\nIn order to account for the hadronic effects in our study we have employed\nthe package PYTHIA 6.1 [18] to generate the quark hadronization and decay\nfrom real W and Z production.\nAn important point that we call attention in this paper is the kinematical\n10\n\n\fe + \u03bde + W + Z\n10\n\n-1\n\nM Le = 100 GeV\n\nM Le = 200 GeV\n\n10 -3\nFigure 6\n\nd\u03c3/dM eZ (pb/GeV)\n\n10 -2\n\n10 -4\n\n10 -5\n\n10 -6\nVSM\n10 -7\n80\n\n135\n\n190\nM eZ (GeV)\n\n245\n\n300\n\nFigure\n6: Reconstruction of the invariant mass MeZ for e+ + \u03bde + W \u2212 + Z at\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV with MN = 100 GeV for the complete VSM extension (signal +\nbackground).\n\n11\n\n\fE e- (GeV)\n45 46 47 48 49\n10 0\n\n10 0\n\n10 -1\n\nM Le = 450 GeV\nM N = 100 GeV\n\n10 -2\n\n10 -3\n\n10 -2\n\n230\n\n236\n\n242 248\nE \u03bd (GeV)\n\nFigure 7\n\n10 -1\n\n-\n\nd\u03c3/dE \u03bd (pb/GeV)\n\nd\u03c3/dE e- (pb/GeV)\n\ne- + e + \u2192 \u03bd e+ e + + W\n\n10 -3\n\nFigure 7: Final lepton\nenergy and invariant mass distributions in the e+ + \u03bde +\n\u221a\n\u2212\nW channel at s = 500 GeV, for MN = 100 GeV and MLe = 450 GeV.\nrelation for a primary electron (positron) produced with a Le that must satisfy:\nEe \u00b1 \u2206E =\n\n(s \u2212 (MLe \u2213 \u0393Le )2 )\n\u221a\n2 s\n\n(4)\n\nFor a sharp \u0393Le we will have a sharp energy distribution of the primary\nlepton produced together with the new heavy charged lepton. This property\nsuggests interesting signatures for heavy charged lepton searches by looking\nat final state charged lepton distributions. This is far more effective than the\nreconstruction of invariant masses or hadron jets from W and Z hadronic decays.\nAnalyzing the Fig. 7, for \u03bde + e+ + W \u2212 channel, we can see that the peak 47.5\nGeV (240 GeV) at the final electron (neutrino) energy distribution is related to\nthe 450 GeV (100 GeV) heavy charged (neutral) mass.\nWe also have reconstructed the final state electron energy distribution in the\ne\u00b1 +e\u2213 + hadrons channel. The background and Z hadronization were generated\n12\n\n\fwith the PYTHIA package as mentioned above. A clear separation between\nsignal and SM background is given by 2-dimensional plots instead of usual 1dimensional plots. We have considered the 2-dimensional phase space plot of\nthe electron and positron energy in the e\u00b1 +e\u2213+ hadrons channel. According to\nequation 4, the electron and positron energy of the events coming from the signal\nare peaked at 160 GeV for a 300 GeV charged lepton mass. This correspond\nto the two crossed lines in Fig. 8a since the process is symmetric. The other\nconcentration at the inclined line is from the standard model Z \u2192 e+ + e\u2212\ndecay. For MLe = 450 GeV the result is given in Fig. 8b with the dense lines\nof the signal shifted to the corners of the kinematical region. For the e+ + \u03bde +\nhadrons channel the analogous plot is given by the final neutrino missing energy\nversus the final positron energy. For this channel we have the contribution of\nboth the neutral and charged heavy leptons, as shown in the Feynman diagrams\nof Fig. 3b. In this case we have one line in the missing energy that comes from a\nneutral heavy lepton decay (MN = 100 GeV) and the other line in the electron\nenergy comes from the charged heavy lepton decay (MLe = 450 GeV). The\nresult is given in Fig. 9 which is a detail of the allowed phase space. We call\nattention to the fact that the heavy neutral lepton line is more defined than the\nheavy charged lepton line. This is due to the higher cross section for the neutral\nheavy lepton, as shown in Fig. 4b and to the different widths. For MLe = 300\nGeV we have a similar figure with an horizontal line at the same position since\nwe maintain MN = 100 GeV and a vertical line at Ee = 160 GeV.\nBesides the general cuts mentioned before, the phase space figures suggest\nthat one can perform additional more restrictive cuts in order to enhance the\nsignal over the background. The numbers of events were obtained for an integral\nluminosity of L = 105 pb\u22121 and an upper bound for the mixing angle sin2 \u03b8mix =\n0.005. Table 3 gives the total number of events for the signal \u221a\ns (VSM) and for\nthe SM background b, as well as the statistical significance s/ b after all cuts.\nAs the planned luminosities could be increased [12] by a factor of 3, one could\nexplore even lowers values for the mixing angle.\n\nFor the e\u00b1 + e\u2213 + hadrons channel, the resulting number of events after all\ncuts is given in Fig. 10a for an integrated luminosity of 105 pb\u22121 . The analogous\nresult for the e+ + \u03bde + hadrons channel is given in Fig. 10b.\nThe lepton number violating decay of heavy charged leptons is significant\nonly in VDM.

The reconstructed invariant mass M\u03bcW W gives the same information, but requires the hadronic reconstruction of the invariant masses and/or\njets of two Ws with higher uncertainties.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have investigated different signatures for heavy charged lepton detection at the next electron-positron\ncolliders. We have presented cross\n\u221a\nsections and distributions for the s = 500 GeV option for NLC and TESLA\ncolliders, but our conclusions are very similar for higher energies. For vector\ncharged leptons we notice that vector doublets and singlets give the same results\nif a new heavy neutrino in the same representation has MN \u2243 MLe . However,\nif the heavy neutrino mass is smaller than the new heavy charged lepton, then\nvector doublets and singlets will show a very different behavior. The decay\nLe \u2192 N + W could be dominant for vector doublets and suppressed for vector singlets. If the new heavy neutrino is of the Majorana type, we will have\nthe possibility of lepton number violation in the heavy charged lepton decay.\nThis property allows the experimental determination of the Dirac or Majorana\nnature of heavy neutral leptons.\n\u221a\nFor new heavy charged leptons with mass up to MLe \u2248 s/2, the dominant\n17\n\n\f10 -1\n\u00b1\n\n+ \u03bc\n\n\u00b1\n\n+ W+W\n\nFigure 11\n\n\u03c3 (pb)\n\ne\n\n10 -2\n\nVDM\nM N = 100 GeV\n10 -3\n180\n\n190\n\n200\n\n210\n220\nM Le (GeV)\n\n230\n\n240\n\n250\n\nFigure 11: Total cross section for e\u2212 + e+ \u2212\u2192 e\u00b1 + \u03bc\u00b1 + W + W channel at\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV with MN = 100 GeV for VDM.\n\n18\n\n\fe - + \u03bc\u2212+ W + + W +\n10 -3\nM Le = 300 GeV\n\nM Le = 450 GeV\n\nFigure 12\n\nd\u03c3/dE e (pb/GeV)\n\n10 -4\n\n10 -5\n\n10 -6\n\nVDM\nM N = 100 GeV\n\n10 -7\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nE e (GeV)\n\nFigure\n12: Electron energy distribution in the e\u2212 + \u03bc\u2212 + W + + W + channel at\n\u221a\ns = 500 GeV with MN = 100 GeV for VDM.\n\n19\n\n\fprocess is pair production via photon exchange. Then the final lepton energy\ndistribution in the processes e\u00b1 + e\u2213 + Z and e+ (e\u2212 ) + \u03bde (\u03bd\u0304e ) + W \u2212 (W + )\nallows a clear separation from the\n\u221a SM background.\n\u221a If the new heavy charged\nlepton has a mass in the range s/2 < MLe < s then single production is a\nfeasible process. In this case we call attention to the kinematical properties of\nthe associated primary lepton produced with the new charged lepton, according\nto the equation 4. Its energy distribution can allow a very precise determination\nof the new heavy lepton mass without the looses and errors that came from the\nreconstruction of hadronic events from W and Z decays. This kind of analysis,\nin the future e\u2212 + e\u2212 colliders, can lead to much stronger bounds on new heavy\nlepton parameters if no signal is found .\nAcknowledgments: This work was partially supported by the following Brazilian agencies: CNPq, FUJB and FAPERJ.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.M.
