Let Tn be the set of rooted labeled trees on {0, . . . , n}. A maximal decreasing\nsubtree of a rooted labeled tree is defined by the maximal subtree from the root with all\nedges being decreasing. In this paper, we study a new refinement Tn,k of Tn , which is the\nset of rooted labeled trees whose maximal decreasing subtree has k + 1 vertices.\n\n1. Introduction\nFor a nonnegative integer n, let Tn be the set of rooted labeled trees on [0, n] :=\n{0, . . . , n}. For a given rooted labeled tree T , a maximal decreasing subtree of T is defined by the maximal subtree from the root with all edges being decreasing, denoted by\nMD(T ). Figure 1 illustrates the maximal decreasing subtree of a given tree T . Let Tn,k be\nthe set of rooted labeled trees in Tn whose maximal decreasing subtree has k + 1 vertices.\nWithin the scope of proven research, a maximal decreasing subtree first appeared in the\npaper [CDG00] of Chauve, Dulucq, and Guibert, for constructing the bijection between\nTn,0 and the set of trees in Tn with n being a leaf. Recently, Bergeron and Livernet [BL10]\nintroduced it in order to analyze the free Lie algebra based on rooted labeled trees. None\nof them mentioned, however, the refined set Tn,k nor considered the enumeration of Tn,k .\nIn Section 2, we shall count the number of elements in Tn,k . We shall also introduce a set\nof certain functions on [n], which is equinumerous to Tn,k . In Section 3, we shall decompose\na rooted labeled tree into rooted subtrees, each maximal decreasing subtree of which is a\nsingle vertex. Then some formulae relatedhto |Tn,k\n| are given from this decomposition. In\n\u0001i\ni+j\nSection 4, using the inverse of the matrix\n, Tn,k can be expressed as a linear\nj\n0\u2264i,j\u2264n\n\ncombination of {(n + 1)n , (n + 2)n , * * * , (2n + 1)n }. In the last section, we discuss bijective\nproofs of our results.\n2. Main results\nFirst of all, let us count the number of elements in the set Tn,k .\nTheorem 1. For nonnegative integers n and k, we have\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nX\nn+1\nS(m + 1, k + 1) k!

The maximal decreasing subtree of T from the root 9\nProof. Given a rooted labeled tree T , let V1 be the union of the set of vertices in MD(T )\nand the set of children of any vertex in MD(T ).

Make a partition\nof V1 into k + 1 blocks, namely, B1 , . . . , Bk+1 . The number of such partitions is equal to\nS(m + 1, k + 1). Take the set V0 consisting of the minimum mi of each block Bi . Make\na decreasing subtree on V0 = {m1 , . . . , mk+1 }. Since it is well known that the number of\n(unordered) increasing trees on k + 1 nodes is k!, there are exactly k! ways of making a\ndecreasing subtree on V0 . Append vertices in V1 \\ V0 to this decreasing subtree such that\nelements in Bi \\ {mi } are children of mi for i = 1, . . . , k + 1. It is well-known that the\nnumber of forests F on [0, n] \\ V0 such that V1 \\ V0 is the set of all roots of F is equal to\n(n \u2212 k)n\u2212m\u22121 (m \u2212 k) (see [Sta99, Prop. 5.3.2]).

Properties\nA rooted labeled tree T is called a local minimum tree, if MD(T ) consists of a single\nvertex.
