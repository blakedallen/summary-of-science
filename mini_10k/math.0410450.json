The chain-level intersection pairing was\nintroduced by Lefschetz [8] as a tool for constructing the intersection pairing on the\nhomology of M . A version of the chain-level intersection pairing is a basic ingredient in\nChas and Sullivan's construction [2] of a Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky structure on the homology\nof the free loop space of M .\nFor a complete understanding of the chain-level intersection pairing, it seems helpful to\nhave the following theorem. Let C\u2217 M be the PL chain complex of M (see Section 3 for\nthe definition). Let us say that a subcomplex of a chain complex is full if the inclusion\nmap is a quasi-isomorphism.\nTheorem 1.1 The domain of the chain-level intersection pairing is a full subcomplex\nof C\u2217 M \u2297 C\u2217 M .\nIt might seem at first that something like Theorem 1.1 would have been needed already\nby Lefschetz to define the intersection pairing on homology, but for that purpose two\nweaker facts would suffice:\n(i) For any cycles C and D in C\u2217 M , the chain C \u2297 D is homologous to an element in\nthe domain of the intersection pairing.\nPublished: 4 October 2006\n\nDOI: 10.2140/gt.2006.10.1391\n\n\f1392\n\nJ E McClure\n\n(ii) If C0 , D0 are two other cycles with C0 \u2297D0 homologous to C\u2297D, then the difference\nC0 \u2297 D0 \u2212 C \u2297 D is the boundary of an element in the domain of the intersection pairing.\n(This is needed to show that the intersection pairing on homology is well-defined.)\nTheorem 1.1 is harder to prove than (i) and (ii) because (among other reasons) a cycle in\nP\nC\u2217 M \u2297 C\u2217 M cannot in general be written in the form\nCi \u2297 Di with Ci and Di cycles.\nOne goal of this paper is to prove Theorem 1.1 and, more generally, the analogous\nstatement for the k\u2013fold iterate of the intersection pairing; see Proposition 12.3 and\nRemark 12.4.\nIt seems useful to go farther and to show that the intersection pairing gives C\u2217 M a\nstructure of \"partially defined commutative DGA;\" this is the second (and main) goal of\nthis paper (see Theorem 12.1). Combining this with Remark 12.2 and [17, Theorem 1]\nshows in particular that C\u2217 M is canonically quasi-isomorphic to an E\u221e chain algebra.\nThe third goal of this paper is to give a new treatment of the chain-level intersection pairing, based on the account of Goresky and MacPherson [5] but with some\nimprovements.\nThe results of this paper will be applied by the author [13] to prove two theorems about\nthe Chas\u2013Sullivan operations. Let LM be the free loop space of M , let S\u2217 denote the\nsingular chain functor and let F be the framed little 2-disks operad as in [4].\nTheorem A The Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky structure on the homology of LM is induced\nby a natural action of an operad quasi-isomorphic to S\u2217 F on a chain complex quasiisomorphic to S\u2217 (LM).\n(Theorem A is the analog for H\u2217 (LM) of Deligne's Hochschild cohomology conjecture;\nsee Markl, Shnider and Stasheff [11, Section I.1.19].)\nTheorem B The Eilenberg\u2013Moore spectral sequence converging to the homology of\nLM is a spectral sequence of Batalin\u2013Vilkovisky algebras.\nThe paper is organized as follows.\nSection 2 gives a brief discussion of the definitions of the chain-level intersection\npairing given in [8], [9] and [5] and explains why these versions of the definition are\nnot convenient as a starting point for proving Theorem 1.1.\nSection 3 recalls (from [5]) the definition of the PL chain complex of a PL space.\nSection 4 recalls (also from [5]) a method for making chain-level constructions by using\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fOn the chain-level intersection pairing for PL manifolds\n\n1393\n\nrelative homology. Section 5 constructs the umkehr (that is, \"reverse\") map in relative\nhomology induced by a PL map between compact oriented PL manifolds. In Section 6\na chain-level umkehr map is deduced from this using the method of Section 4. Section 7\nrecalls the definition of exterior product for PL chains.\nIn Section 8, the chain-level intersection pairing is defined as the composite of the\nexterior product and the chain-level umkehr map induced by the diagonal map; the\nmotivation for this definition is that the intersection of two subsets of a set S can be\nidentified with the intersection of their Cartesian product with the diagonal in S \u00d7 S.\nSection 9 gives the formal definition of \"partially defined commutative algebra.\" I use\nLeinster's concept of homotopy algebra [10] for this purpose rather than the Kriz\u2013May\ndefinition of partial algebra [7] (but I will use the term \"Leinster partial algebra\" instead\nof \"homotopy algebra,\" since the latter term seems excessively generic). The reason\nfor using Leinster's definition is that it is simpler and more intuitive. It will be shown\nin [13] that the Kriz\u2013May definition is a special case of the Leinster definition (see\nRemark 9.5(b) below).\nSection 10\u2013Section 13 give the proof that the intersection pairing and its iterates\ndetermine a Leinster partial commutative DGA structure on C\u2217 M . The proof uses a\n\"moving lemma\" (Lemma 13.5) which is proved in Section 14 by means of a generalposition result (Proposition 14.6) that may be of independent interest. Proposition 14.6\nis proved in Section 15 and Section 16.\nMy work on this paper was partially supported by NSF grant DMS-0405693.\nI would like to thank Mike Mandell for his help, Greg Friedman, Mark Goresky and\nClint McCrory for useful correspondence, and the referee for a careful reading of the\npaper and for helpful comments. I would especially like to thank Shmuel Weinberger\nfor referring me to [5].\nI would also like to thank the Lord for making my work possible.\n\n2\n\nThe Lefschetz and Goresky\u2013MacPherson definitions of the\nchain-level intersection pairing\n\nThis section is not needed logically for the rest of the paper; it is offered as motivation\nfor Section 3\u2013Section 8. The reader may also find it helpful to consult Steenrod's\naccount of Lefschetz's work on the intersection pairing [16, pages 28\u201330].\nThis section uses some technical terms which will be defined in Section 3\u2013Section 7.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1394\n\nJ E McClure\n\nLefschetz's first account of the chain-level intersection pairing C * D was in [8]. In this\nP\nP\npaper he uses the obvious definition: if C =\nmi \u03c3i and D =\nni \u03c4i then\nX\n(1)\nC*D=\n\u00b1 mi nj \u03c3i \u2229 \u03c4j ,\nwhere the signs are determined by the orientations of \u03c3i , \u03c4j and M . This formula does\nnot in fact give a chain unless all of the intersections \u03c3i \u2229 \u03c4j have the same dimension,\nso some restriction on the pair (C, D) is necessary. Generically, the intersection\nof a p\u2013dimensional PL subspace and a q\u2013dimensional PL subspace has dimension\n\u2264 p + q \u2212 dim M ; pairs of PL subspaces with this property are said to be in general\nposition. Lefschetz restricts the domain of the intersection pairing to pairs (C, D) for\nwhich all of the pairs (\u03c3i , \u03c4j ) are in general position, and he interprets terms \u03c3i \u2229 \u03c4j\nwhich are in dimension less than dim C + dim D \u2212 dim M as 0.\nIn order to prove the crucial formula\n(2)\n\n\u2202(C * D) = (\u2202C) * D \u00b1 C * \u2202D,\n\nLefschetz imposes a further restriction on the domain of the intersection pairing: he\nrequires that all of the pairs (\u2202\u03c3i , \u03c4j ) and (\u03c3i , \u2202\u03c4j ) should also be in general position.1\nThis assumption allows him to prove equation (2) by working with one pair of simplices\nat a time and extending additively.\nThis definition has the disadvantage that the domain of the intersection pairing is not\ninvariant under subdivision. For example, if \u03c3 and \u03c4 are 1\u2013simplices in a 2\u2013manifold\nintersecting at a point in the interior of both, then the pair (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) is in the domain, but if\nwe subdivide \u03c3 and \u03c4 at the intersection point we obtain a pair of chains (\u03c3 0 +\u03c3 00 , \u03c4 0 +\u03c4 00 )\nwhich is not in the domain (because for example the pair (\u2202\u03c3 0 , \u03c4 0 ) is not in general\nposition).2 This phenomenon is general: if (C, D) is in the domain of this version of\nthe intersection pairing with C * D 6= 0 then there will always be a subdivision in which\nthe pair of chains determined by C and D is not in the domain.\nLefschetz returned to the chain-level intersection pairing in [9, Section IV.6]. He\ngave a formula more general than (1) (equation (46) on page 212) in which the\ncoefficients are \"looping coefficients\" [9, Section IV.5]. This allowed him to enlarge the domain of the intersection pairing as follows: if we write supp(C) for the\nunion of the simplices that occur in C, then C * D is defined when the three pairs\n1\n\nIf C and D are chains on the same triangulation this condition forces C * D to be 0, because\n\u03c3i and \u03c4j will intersect along a common face and therefore \u03c3i \u2229 \u03c4j will be contained in \u2202\u03c3i \u2229 \u03c4j .\n2\nNote also that, if the intersection point is P, then formula (1) gives \u03c3 * \u03c4 = \u00b1P but\n0\n(\u03c3 + \u03c3 00 ) * (\u03c4 0 + \u03c4 00 ) = \u00b14P.\n\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fOn the chain-level intersection pairing for PL manifolds\n\n1395\n\n(supp(C), supp(D)), (supp(\u2202C), supp(D)), (supp(C), supp(\u2202D)) are in general position;\nnote that this condition is invariant under subdivision.\nThe \"looping coefficients\" used in Lefschetz's second definition are tricky to define\nexplicitly [9, Subsection 58 on page 216]. The theory has been worked out carefully\nin Keller [6] (which I have not had an opportunity to consult) and seems to be rather\ncomplicated (see the Math Review).\nThe chain-level intersection pairing became temporarily obsolete when the cup product\nwas discovered and it was noticed that the intersection pairing in homology could be\ndefined using only Poincar\u00e9 duality and the cup product, without any recourse to the\nchain level.\nGoresky and MacPherson returned to the chain-level intersection pairing as a tool for\nconstructing an intersection pairing in intersection homology [5, Section 2]. They\nintroduced the PL chain complex C\u2217 M (as the direct limit of simplicial chains under\nsubdivision; see Section 3 ) and defined the intersection pairing (which they denoted by\n\u2229) on a certain subset of C\u2217 M \u00d7 C\u2217 M by means of an elegant construction in which\nthe procedure of the previous paragraph is reversed: the chain-level intersection pairing\nis derived from the relative versions of Poincar\u00e9 duality and the cup product. Their\nversion of the chain-level intersection pairing is probably equivalent to Lefschetz's\nsecond definition.\nIn order to prove (or even state) Theorem 1.1 it is necessary to extend the domain of the\nintersection pairing from a subset of C\u2217 M \u00d7 C\u2217 M to a subset of C\u2217 M \u2297 C\u2217 M . The\nobvious way to do this would be to consider elements\nX\nCi \u2297 Di\nin which every pair (Ci , Di ) is in the domain of the Goresky\u2013MacPherson intersection\npairing \u2229 and to define the intersection pairing on such an element to be\nX\nCi \u2229 Di .\nBut it is not at all clear that this is well defined, and it also is not clear how to determine\nwhen an element of C\u2217 M \u2297 C\u2217 M has the required form (which would make it difficult\nto show that the domain of the operation is a full subcomplex).\nThe definition to be given in Section 8 resolves both of these issues by defining the\nintersection pairing (up to a dimension shift) as the composite of the exterior product\n\u03b5 : C\u2217 M \u2297 C\u2217 M \u2192 C\u2217 (M \u00d7 M)\n(see Section 7) and the chain-level umkehr map\n\u2206! : C\u2217\u2206 (M \u00d7 M) \u2192 C\u2217 M\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1396\n\nJ E McClure\n\ninduced by the diagonal (see Section 6); here C\u2217\u2206 (M \u00d7 M) denotes the set of chains\nE in C\u2217 (M \u00d7 M) for which both E and \u2202E are in general position with respect to the\ndiagonal. With this definition, the domain of the intersection pairing (up to a dimension\nshift) is\n\u03b5\u22121 (C\u2217\u2206 (M \u00d7 M)).\nThe analog of equation (2) is immediate from the fact that \u03b5 and \u2206! are chain maps.\n\n3\n\nPL chains\n\nWe begin by reviewing some basic definitions.\nA simplicial complex K is a set of simplices in Rn (for some n) with two properties:\nevery face of a simplex in K is in K and the intersection of two simplices in K is a\ncommon face. (A face of a simplex \u03c3 is the simplex spanned by some subset of the\nvertices of \u03c3 .)\nThe simplicial chain complex of K , denoted c\u2217 K , is defined by letting cp K be generated\nby pairs (\u03c3, o), where \u03c3 is a p\u2013simplex of K and o is an orientation of \u03c3 , subject to\nthe relation (\u03c3, o) = \u2212(\u03c3, \u2212o) where \u2212o denotes the opposite orientation. We leave it\nas an exercise to formulate the definition of the boundary map \u2202 (or see Spanier [15,\npage 159]). If we choose orientations for the simplices of K (with no requirement\nof consistency among the orientations) then every nonzero element c of c\u2217 K can be\nP\nwritten uniquely in the form\nni \u03c3i with all ni 6= 0.\nThe realization of K , denoted |K|, is the union of the simplices of K .\nA subdivision of K is a simplicial complex L with two properties: |L| = |K| and every\nsimplex of L is contained in a simplex of K .\nThe subdivision category of K has an object for each subdivision L of K and a morphism\nL \u2192 L0 whenever L0 is a subdivision of L.\nIf L0 is a subdivision of L there is an induced monomorphism c\u2217 L \u2192 c\u2217 L0 which takes\nP\n(\u03c3, o) to (\u03c4, o\u03c4 ), where the sum runs over all \u03c4 \u2208 L0 which are contained in \u03c3 and\nhave the same dimension as \u03c3 , and o\u03c4 is the orientation induced by o. This makes c\u2217 a\ncovariant functor on the subdivision category of K .\nA subspace X of Rn will be called a PL space if there is a simplicial complex K with\nX = |K|. K will be called a triangulation of X ; note that X determines K up to\nsubdivision by Bryant [1, page 222].\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fOn the chain-level intersection pairing for PL manifolds\n\n1397\n\nThe PL chain complex of a PL space |K|, denoted C\u2217 |K|, is the direct limit\ncolim c\u2217 L\nL\n\ntaken over the subdivision category of K .\nRemark 3.1 This definition is taken from Goresky and MacPherson [5, Subsection\n1.2], which seems to be the first place where the PL chain complex was defined.\nNote that the direct system defining C\u2217 |K| is a rather simple one: the subdivision\ncategory is a directed set (because any two subdivisions have a common refinement [1,\npage 222]), and all of the maps c\u2217 L \u2192 c\u2217 L0 are monomorphisms. It follows that each\nof the maps c\u2217 L \u2192 C\u2217 |K| is a monomorphism.\nRemark 3.2 The homology of c\u2217 L is canonically isomorphic to the singular homology\nof |K| by [15, Theorems 4.3.8 and 4.4.2]; since homology commutes with colimits over\ndirected sets, the homology of C\u2217 |K| is also canonically isomorphic to the singular\nhomology of |K|.\nNow let C be a nonzero element of C\u2217 |K|. There is a subdivision L of K with C in\nP\nc\u2217 L, so (after choosing orientations for the simplices in L) we can write C =\nni \u03c3 i\nwhere the \u03c3i are simplices in L and the ni are nonzero. We define the support of C,\nS\ndenoted supp(C), to be \u03c3i ; this is independent of the choice of L. The support of 0\nis defined to be the empty set.\n\n4\n\nA useful lemma\n\nLet K be a simplicial complex. A subcomplex of K is a subset K 0 of K with the\nproperty that every face of every simplex in K 0 is also in K 0 .\nA PL subspace of |K| is a space of the form |L| where L is a subcomplex of a subdivision\nof K .\nThe next lemma is taken from Section 1.2 of [5]; it gives a way of using relative\nhomology to make chain-level constructions.\nLemma 4.1 Let K be a simplicial complex and let A and B be PL subspaces of |K|\nsuch that B \u2282 A and dim B \u2264 dim A \u2212 1.

The set specified in the lemma is the set of relative cycles,\nwhile the set of relative boundaries is \u2202(Cp+1 A) + Cp B, which is zero because of the\nhypotheses. Part (b) is immediate from the definitions.\n\n5\n\nAn umkehr map in relative homology\n\nA PL map from |K| to |K 0 | is a continuous function f with the property that, for some\nsubdivision L of K , the restriction of f to each simplex of L is an affine map with\nimage in a simplex of K 0 .\nA PL homeomorphism is a PL map which is a homeomorphism.\nAn m\u2013dimensional PL manifold is a PL space M with the property that each point of\nM is contained in the interior of a PL subspace which is PL homeomorphic to the m\nsimplex.\nLet M be a compact oriented m\u2013dimensional PL manifold and let A and B be PL\nsubspaces of M with B \u2282 A.

By the naturality of the cap product [3, VIII.7.6] this\ncomposite is independent of the choice of (U, V) and is natural with respect to (U 0 , V 0 ).\nWe therefore get a map\nH\u2217 (A, B) \u2192 lim H\u2217+n\u2212m (U 0 , V 0 )\nwhere the inverse limit is taken over all open pairs (U 0 , V 0 ) \u2283 (A0 , B0 ). This inverse\nlimit is isomorphic to H\u2217+n\u2212m (A0 , B0 ) by [3, Exercise 4 at the end of Section VIII.13];\nhere we use the fact that the realization of a simplicial complex is an ENR (see for\nexample [3, Proposition IV.8.12]). This completes the construction of the map (3).\nFor use in the next section, we need:\nLemma 5.1 The following diagram commutes:\nH\u2217 (A, B)\n\u2202\n\n\u000f\n\nH\u2217\u22121 (B)\n\nf!\n\nf!\n\n/ H\u2217+n\u2212m (A0 , B0 )\n\u000f\n\n\u2202\n\n/ H\u2217+n\u2212m\u22121 (B0 )\n\nProof This follows easily from [3, VII.12.22].\n\n6\n\nAn umkehr map at the chain level\n\nLet M , N and f : N \u2192 M be as in the previous section.\nWe say that a PL subspace A of M is in general position with respect to f if\ndim(f \u22121 (A)) \u2264 dim A + n \u2212 m.\n(The dimension of the empty set is defined to be \u2212\u221e, so if f \u22121 (A) is empty then A is\nin general position.)\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1400\n\nJ E McClure\n\nRemark 6.1 For later use we make two observations.\n(a) Suppose that f is a composite gh, that A is in general position with respect to g,\nand that g\u22121 (A) is in general position with respect to h. Then A is in general position\nwith respect to f .\n(b) Suppose that N is a Cartesian product M \u00d7 M1 and f : N \u2192 M is the projection.\nThen every A is in general position with respect to f .\nA p\u2013chain C in C\u2217 M is said to be in general position with respect to f if\ndim(f \u22121 (supp(C))) \u2264 p + n \u2212 m.\nLet C\u2217f M be the set of all chains C \u2208 C\u2217 M for which both C and \u2202C are in general\nposition with respect to f .

It is easy to see that \u03c31 \u00d7 \u03c32 is a PL space; that is, there\nis a simplicial complex J with |J| = \u03c31 \u00d7 \u03c32 . Note that there is no canonical way to\nchoose J , but that any two choices of J have a common subdivision.\nIt follows that the product of any two PL spaces is a PL space.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fOn the chain-level intersection pairing for PL manifolds\n\n1401\n\nLet |K1 | and |K2 | be PL spaces.

Let J be a simplicial complex with\n|J| = \u03c31 \u00d7 \u03c32 .\nThen \u03b50 ((\u03c31 , o1 ) \u2297 (\u03c32 , o2 )) is defined to be\nX\n(\u03c4, o\u03c4 )\nwhere \u03c4 runs through the simplices of J with dimension dim \u03c31 + dim \u03c32 , and o\u03c4 is\nthe orientation of \u03c4 induced by o1 \u00d7 o2 .\nThe maps \u03b50 are consistent as L1 and L2 vary; passage to colimits gives the map \u03b5.\nRemark 7.1 (a) It is easy to check that \u03b5 is a monomorphism.\n(b) The quasi-isomorphism relating c\u2217 to singular chains [15, Theorems 4.3.8 and\n4.4.2] takes \u03b5 to the Eilenberg\u2013MacLane shuffle product [3, VI.12.26.2]. Since the\nlatter is a quasi-isomorphism, so is \u03b5.\n(c) For singular chains, the shuffle product has an explicit natural homotopy inverse,\nnamely the Alexander\u2013Whitney map [3, VI.12.26.2]. Unfortunately the Alexander\u2013\nWhitney map requires an ordering of the vertices of each simplex, so it seems to have\nno analog for PL chains.\n\n8\n\nThe chain-level intersection pairing\n\nWe now have the ingredients needed to define the chain-level intersection pairing.\nLet M be a compact oriented PL manifold of dimension m and let \u2206 be the diagonal\nmap from M to M \u00d7 M .

Then \u03c3 and \u03c4 are in general position.\nProof Let U (resp. V ) be the affine span of \u03c3 (resp. \u03c4 ). If U \u2229 V is empty the\nstatement is obvious. Otherwise we can choose a point in U \u2229 V and move it to the\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\f1416\n\nJ E McClure\n\norigin by a translation; then U and V become ordinary subspaces which span Rn and\nwe have\ndim(U \u2229 V) = dim U + dim V \u2212 n,\nwhich proves the lemma.\nNotation 15.2 If \u03c3 is a simplex in Rn and u is an element of Rn which is not in \u03c3 ,\nthe convex hull of \u03c3 and u will be denoted by h\u03c3, ui.\nLemma 15.3 Let \u03c3 and \u03c4 be simplices in Rn . Let u be a point which is not in the\naffine span of \u03c3 \u222a \u03c4 . Then\nh\u03c3, ui \u2229 \u03c4 = \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4.\nProof Let v \u2208 h\u03c3, ui \u2229 \u03c4 . Since v \u2208 h\u03c3, ui, we can write v in the form \u03b1u + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)s,\nwith s \u2208 \u03c3 . If \u03b1 were nonzero we would have\nu=\n\n1\n1\u2212\u03b1\nv\u2212\ns.\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\nSince v \u2208 \u03c4 , this would imply that u is in the affine span of \u03c3 \u222a \u03c4 . Therefore \u03b1 must\nbe 0, so v is in \u03c3 , and hence in \u03c3 \u2229 \u03c4 , which proves the lemma.\nNext we recall a well-known way of triangulating \u03c3 \u00d7 I . By an ordered simplex we\nwill mean a simplex with a total ordering of its vertices.\nLemma 15.4 Let \u03c3 be an ordered simplex and let v0 < * * * < vl be the ordering of its\nvertices. For 0 \u2264 i \u2264 l let \u03c3[i] \u2282 \u03c3 \u00d7 I be the convex hull of\n{(vj , 0) | j \u2264 i} \u222a {(vj , 1) | j \u2265 i}.\nThen each \u03c3[i] is an (l + 1)\u2013simplex.\nAlso, the set L whose elements are the \u03c3[i] and their faces is a triangulation of \u03c3 \u00d7 I .\nRemark 15.5 With the notation of Lemma 15.4, let \u03c4 be the simplex spanned by\nv0 , . . . , vl\u22121 . Then\n\u03c3[i] = h\u03c4 [i], (vl , 1)i\n\nfor each i < l,\n\nand\n\n\u03c3[l] = h\u03c3 \u00d7 {0}, (vl , 1)i.\n\nFinally, we need a tool for extending PL maps and homotopies.\nGeometry & Topology 10 (2006)\n\n\fOn the chain-level intersection pairing for PL manifolds\n\n1417\n\nConstruction 15.6 Let \u03c1 be a simplex in Rn and let u be an element of Rn which is\nnot in \u03c1.\nLet \u03a9 be a PL space with a PL homeomorphism \u03c9 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u2206m .\n(i) Let f : \u03c1 \u2192 \u03a9 be a PL map and w an element of \u03a9.

Let \u03c6 : \u03c1 \u00d7 I \u2192 \u03a9 be a PL homotopy and let z and\nz0 be elements of \u03a9.

For i < l we have\nh\u03c1, ui[i] = h\u03c1[i], (u, 1)i\nby Remark 15.5. \u03c6 is already defined on \u03c1[i], and we can extend it to h\u03c1[i], (u, 1)i by\nusing the construction in part (i). For i = l, Remark 15.5 gives\nh\u03c1, ui[l] = hh\u03c1, ui \u00d7 {0}, (u, 1)i = hh\u03c1 \u00d7 {0}, (u, 0)i, (u, 1)i.\n\u03c6 is already defined on \u03c1 \u00d7 {0}, and we can extend it to hh\u03c1 \u00d7 {0}, (u, 0)i, (u, 1)i by\napplying the construction in part (i) twice, taking (u, 0) to z and (u, 1) to z0 .\n\n16\n\nProof of Proposition 14.6\n\nBy the definition of PL manifold, there is a collection of PL subspaces \u03a9i \u2282 M such\nthat each \u03a9i is PL homeomorphic to \u2206m and the interiors int(\u03a9i ) cover M .

For this we\nneed a precise description of the subspace \u03c6p (\u03c0j \u00d7 {1}). Recall that \u03c1j denotes the face\nof \u03c0j opposite to the vertex vp .

By Lemma 15.1, this condition is automatically satisfied (with no\nrestriction on z0 ) by those pairs for which the affine span of \u03c7q \u222a \u03c9i(j) (\u03c4 ) is all of Rm .\nFor the remaining pairs, it suffices by Lemma 15.3 that \u03c9i(j) (z0 ) should not be in the\naffine span of \u03c7q \u222a \u03c9i(j) (\u03c4 ) (note that \u03c7q and \u03c9i(j) (\u03c4 ) are in general position because\nwe have assumed that \u03c6p\u22121 satisfies property (4)). Since this affine span is nowhere\ndense, the set of allowable z0 for each such pair is an open set Vq which is dense in \u039e.\nThe intersection of the Vq is an open set V which is dense in \u039e and if z0 \u2208 V then the\ncondition in Lemma 16.7(a) is satisfied.\nFor part (b), let l denote the dimension of \u03c0j .

Also, it's convenient to let the symbol f! stand for the\ndesuspension\n\u03a3\u2212m H\u2217 (A, B) \u2192 \u03a3\u2212n H\u2217 (A0 , B0 ).\nNote that this map preserves degrees.\nWith these changes, Lemma 5.1 says that the diagram\n\u03a3\u2212m H\u2217 (A, B)\n\u2202\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03a3\u2212m H\u2217 (B)\n\nf!\n\nf!\n\n/ \u03a3\u2212n H\u2217 (A0 , B0 )\n\u000f\n\n\u2202\n\n/ \u03a3\u2212n H (B0 )\n\u2217\n\ncommutes.\nIn Section 8, observe that if C\u2217 and D\u2217 are chain complexes and m, n \u2208 Z then\n(\u03a3\u2212m C\u2217 ) \u2297 (\u03a3\u2212n D\u2217 ) and \u03a3\u2212(m+n) (C\u2217 \u2297 D\u2217 ) will be different chain complexes when\nn is odd: they are the same as graded abelian groups but have different differentials.\nHowever, there is an isomorphism\n\u0398 : (\u03a3\u2212m C\u2217 ) \u2297 (\u03a3\u2212n D\u2217 ) \u2192 \u03a3\u2212(m+n) (C\u2217 \u2297 D\u2217 )\nwhich takes \u03a3\u2212m x \u2297 \u03a3\u2212n y to (\u22121)n|x| \u03a3\u2212(m+n) (x \u2297 y), and similarly for any number of\ntensor factors.\nPublished: 12 March 2009\n\nDOI: 10.2140/gt.2009.13.1775\n\n\f1776\n\nJ E McClure\n\nGiven manifolds M1 and M2 of dimensions m1 , m2 , define\n\u03b5\u0304 : (\u03a3\u2212m1 C\u2217 M1 ) \u2297 (\u03a3\u2212m2 C\u2217 M2 ) \u2192 \u03a3\u2212(m1 +m2 ) C\u2217 (M1 \u00d7 M2 )\nto be\n(\u22121)m1 m2 (\u03a3\u2212(m1 +m2 ) \u03b5) \u25e6 \u0398.\nThe motivation for this is that \u03b5\u0304 is Poincar\u00e9 dual to the exterior product in cohomology\n(see [2] for details).
