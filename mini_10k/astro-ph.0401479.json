Recently available near-infrared interferometric data on late-type stars show a strong increase of diameter for asymp-\n\ntotic giant branch (AGB) stars between the K (2.0 \u2212 2.4 \u03bcm) and L (3.4 \u2212 4.1 \u03bcm) bands. Aiming at an explanation of these\nfindings, we chose the objects \u03b1 Orionis (Betelgeuse), SW Virginis, and R Leonis, which are of different spectral types and\nstages of evolution, and which are surrounded by circumstellar envelopes with different optical thicknesses. For these stars, we\ncompared observations with spherically symmetric dust shell models. Photometric and 11 \u03bcm interferometric data were also\ntaken into account to further constrain the models. \u2013 We find the following results. For all three AGB stars, the photosphere\nand dust shell model is consistent with the multi-wavelength photometric data. For \u03b1 Orionis the model dust shell has a very\nsmall optical depth (0.0065 at 11 \u03bcm); the visibility data and model in K and L are essentially entirely photospheric with no\nsignificant contribution from the dust, and the visibility data at 11 \u03bcm show a strong dust signature which agrees with the\nmodel. For SW Virginis the model dust shell has a small optical depth (0.045 at 11 \u03bcm); in K the visibility data and model are\nessentially purely photospheric, in L the visibility data demand a larger object than the photosphere plus dust model allows,\nand at 11 \u03bcm there was no data available. For R Leonis the model dust shell has a moderate optical depth (0.1 at 11 \u03bcm); in\nK and L the visibility data and model situation is similar to that of SW Vir, and at 11 \u03bcm the visibility data and model are\nin agreement. \u2013 We conclude that AGB models comprising a photosphere and dust shell, although consistent with SED data\nand also interferometric data in K and at 11 \u03bcm, cannot explain the visibility data in L; an additional source of model opacity,\npossibly related to a gas component, is needed in L to be consistent with the visibility data.\nKey words.

Introduction\nSupergiant stars and stars on the Asymptotic Giant Branch\n(AGB) are surrounded by a dust envelope coupled with gas;\nfor example, see Habing (1996) for a review of these objects,\nWillson (2000) for a review of mass loss, and Tsuji (2000) for\nevidence of H2 O shells around supergiants.\nAGB stars are subject to pulsation and other surface phenomena (shock waves, acoustic waves etc., see Lafon &\nBerruyer (1991)) that levitate matter above the stellar photosphere. Dust grains appear in the envelope at altitudes where\nthe temperature falls below the condensation temperature. The\nradiation pressure drives the dust grain overflow far from the\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\npschuller@cfa.harvard.edu\n\nPeter\n\nSchuller,\n\ne-mail:\n\nstar up to distances of a thousand stellar radii causing massloss.\nThe mechanism for mass loss in supergiants is not so clear.\nThe main difference compared to Mira stars is that due to\nthe larger luminosity of supergiants the atmosphere is much\nmore extended and has a much greater pressure scale height.\nTherefore, the mass loss may have a different driving force although pulsation may also play a role.\nBoth kinds of stars are characterised by their large diameter\nand strong luminosity and are consequently very good candidates for infrared interferometry. In the next section, we briefly\npresent the instruments which were used to acquire the interferometric data discussed in this paper, namely FLUOR in the K\nband (2.0 \u2212 2.4 \u03bcm) and TISIS in the L band (3.4 \u2212 4.1 \u03bcm). We\nselected three particular stars of three different types for which\n\n\f2\n\nP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\nwe have a substantial set of data: the supergiant \u03b1 Ori, the semiregular SW Vir, and the Mira-type star R Leo. Furthermore,\ntheir envelopes have quite differing optical thicknesses. It appears that for the objects with large optical depth (SW Vir and\nR Leo) the observed diameters in L are considerably larger than\nthe respective K band diameters (see Sect. 2.3). Measurements\nin the L band are more sensitive to cooler material above the\nstellar photosphere than are the K band data. The question is:\nwhat is the physical nature of these layers? One possibility\nmight be astronomical dust. Dust reprocesses the star radiation,\nin particular in the infrared. Depending on the dust abundance,\nthe star's L band radiation might be superposed by a dust contribution that probes the inner region of the dust envelope at a\nfew stellar radii away from the star. The measured L band radius might consequently be increased compared to the K band,\nwhich is mainly fed by stellar emission.\nIn Sect. 3, the modelling of the dust envelopes around these\nstars by a radiative transfer code is explained and the parameters of the model are described. In Sect. 4, we compare the\nmodel output with the interferometric and photometric data.\nFinally, in Sect. 5 we discuss the limits of such models and the\nquestions they raise about the L band observations.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\n\n2.1. Instruments used\nThe stars discussed here were observed with the IOTA\n(Infrared-Optical Telescope Array) interferometer operating\n(at that time) with two telescopes (Traub 1998). IOTA is located at the Smithsonian Institution's Whipple Observatory on\nMount Hopkins, Arizona. It offers multiple baseline observations providing visibilities at different spatial frequencies. This\nenables a model-fit to the visibility data to obtain information\non the spatial intensity distribution of the sources. The beams\nwere combined with FLUOR (Fiber Linked Unit for Optical\nRecombination) in the K band (Coud\u00e9 du Foresto et al. 1998)\nand with its extension to the L band TISIS (Thermal Infrared\nStellar Interferometric Set-up, Mennesson et al. (1999)). Beam\ncombination with FLUOR is achieved by a single-mode fluoride glass triple coupler. The fibres filter the wavefronts corrugated by the atmospheric turbulence. The phase fluctuations are\ntraded against photometric fluctuations which are monitored\nfor each beam to correct for them a posteriori. The accuracy\non visibility estimates measured by FLUOR is usually better\nthan 1% for most sources (Perrin et al. 1998) and can be as\ngood as 0.2% (Perrin 2003).\nTISIS is the extension of FLUOR to the thermal infrared\n(3.4 \u2212 4.1 \u03bcm). A single coupler is used as beam combiner\nand photometric signals are not monitored. Approximate correction of turbulence-induced flux fluctuations is achieved with\nthe low-frequency part of the interferometric signal. Accuracy\nin the L band is therefore not as good as in the K band, but still\nbetter than without spatial filtering by fibres. The acquisition\nprotocol is also different from that of the K band, since groundbased interferometric observations encounter a new difficulty at\n3.6 \u03bcm. Thermal background emission produces a fluctuating\nphotometric offset which must be correctly subtracted in order\n\nTable 1.

Hence each source observation\nmust be bracketed by a sky background measurement (chopping) that reduces the instrument efficiency.\n\n2.2. Data selection\nWe chose to include three stars in our study which span\ndifferent spectral types and stages of evolution, namely the\nsupergiant \u03b1 Orionis (Betelgeuse), the semi-regular variable\nSW Virginis, and the Mira star R Leonis. Some basic parameters of these objects are compiled in Table 1. These stars are\nalso some of the most observed in our sample. The L band data\nare extracted from Chagnon et al. (2002) \u2013 we have used the\ndata from the February-March 2000 observations. The K band\ndata for \u03b1 Orionis were presented in Perrin et al. (2003a) and\nobservations cover the period February 1996 to March 1997.\nThe K band data for SW Virginis were collected in May 2000\nand are presented in Perrin (2003). Lastly, the K band data for\nR Leonis were published in Perrin et al. (1999) and were collected in April 1996 and March 1997. Except for SW Virginis,\nthere is a large time difference between the dates of the L band\nand K band data acquisitions. We believe this to not be a major\nissue - although these stars are known to be variable, the effects we want to analyse are slower than the periodic changes\nof stars and larger in amplitude.\nIn order to get the best constraints on the dust shell model\nspatial distribution, we have included interferometric data acquired with ISI (Infrared Spatial Interferometer, Hale et al.\n(2000)) at 11.15 \u03bcm as published by Danchi et al. (1994).\nA journal of all used data points is given in Table 2.\n\n2.3. Uniform disk diameters\nThe visibilities Vi , and their standard deviations \u03c3i , in the K and\nL bands were fitted by a uniform disk model by minimising the\nquantity:\n\u03c72 =\n\nn\nX\n(Vi \u2212 M(\u03c6UD , S i ))2\ni=1\n\n\u03c32i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the number of available measurements in the respective band. M is the uniform disk model:\nM(\u03c6UD , S i ) =\n\n2J1 (\u03c0\u03c6UDS i )\n,\n\u03c0\u03c6UD S i\n\n(2)\n\nwith S i the spatial frequency and \u03c6UD the uniform disk diameter. J1 is the Bessel function of first order.\n\n\fP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\n3\n\nTable 2. Journal of interferometric data. K band (FLUOR) data for \u03b1 Orionis have been presented in Perrin et al. (2003a), for\nSW Virginis in Perrin (2003), and for R Leonis in Perrin et al. (1999).

Modelling of the dust envelope\nThe models used in this paper are based on a radiative transfer\ncode maintained at the Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d'Azur in Nice,\nFrance. A description of the code is presented by Niccolini\net al. (2003). We discuss hereafter the main hypotheses and\nparameters of this model.\n\n3.1. Description of the radiative transfer code\nThe code is based on the modelling of stellar radiation and circumstellar dust envelope interaction by a Monte Carlo method,\nassuming thermal equilibrium. The star is assumed to be a\nblackbody whose emitted energy is split in a number of packets, or \"photons\". These photons can either pass the envelope\ndirectly, or they are scattered once or more in the envelope, or\nthe photons are absorbed and then thermally re-emitted by the\ndust grains. A grid over the dust envelope is defined with radial zones and angular sections, with the resolution accounting\nfor expected temperature gradients. From the resulting temperature profile, the code derives the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) for the three individual photon flux contributions mentioned above. Initially, the stellar radius is left as scaling factor. Assigning a specific stellar radius, the total SED can be\ncompared to photometric data in order to constrain the model.\nAbsorption, emission, and scattering by gaseous components\nare not taken into account.\nFurthermore, the spatial flux distribution at a given wavelength can be derived, i.e., a model image of the object at this\nwavelength can be created. The Fourier transform of the model\nimage can be compared to visibilities measured at that wavelength which yields a further constraint to the model. For the\npurpose of producing the image, the code allows a zooming\nfactor while the image dimensions are always fixed at 300\u00d7300\npixels.\n\n3.2. Parameters of the envelope\nThe code offers several parameters that can be chosen. The size\ndistribution s(a) of spherical dust particles having the radius a\nwas set as s(a) \u223c a\u22123.5 , according to the interstellar medium\n\n(Mathis et al. 1977) and independent of the distance from the\nstar. The radius a was contained in the range 0.005 \u2212 0.25 \u03bcm.\nThe particle density distribution n(r) of the dust grains that\nwas used in this study includes acceleration effects on dust by\nradiation pressure and gas drag (see Appendix A). The resulting density distribution is much more peaked at the inner edge\nof the envelope than is a r\u22122 distribution.\nFor our study, the dust particle material was constrained to\nastronomical silicates. Their complex dielectric function (respectively complex refractive index) is given by Draine & Lee\n(1984). It was sampled at 37 wavelengths between 0.1 \u03bcm and\n300 \u03bcm, with the sample points considering local extrema.\nThe previously mentioned parameters were chosen in consistency with the relevant subset of studies reported by Danchi\net al. (1994). They were set and fixed in this study. To fit the\nmodel to the data, the following input parameters were adjusted. The stellar radius R\u22c6 and the stellar effective temperature T \u22c6 govern the flux radiated by the star. Spherical symmetry was assumed for a dust shell around the star with an inner\nradius ri and an outer radius ro , in units of R\u22c6 . Furthermore,\nthe envelope is characterised by its optical depth, \u03c4\u03bb , which is\ndefined for overall extinction (absorption and scattering). It can\nbe chosen at a given wavelength, \u03bb, expressed in \u03bcm.\nSince the code, as used for this study, does not take into\naccount possible changes of the dust properties when heated\nbeyond the dust condensation temperature, the temperature\nmap has to be checked accordingly for each set of parameters. As condensation temperature for silicates, we adopted\nT cond \u2248 1000 K (Gail & Sedlmayr 1998).\n\n4. Comparison between model and observations\nWe now study the case of three particular stars. The question\nis whether a simple spherical dust shell model can account for\nthe large diameter differences observed in the K and L bands.\nThe goal is to find the stellar parameters for which visibility\npoints in the K and L bands and at 11 \u03bcm are compatible and\nsimultaneously in agreement with the photometric data.\n\n4.1. A supergiant: \u03b1 Orionis\nBetelgeuse is a Semi-Regular (SRc) variable star of spectral\ntype M1I. It is a late-type supergiant star with a 2335-day period (see Table 1).\nThe mass-loss rate \u1e40 of \u03b1 Orionis is moderate. Knapp et al.\n(1998) estimate a mass-loss rate from CO emission measurements of 3.1 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 at HIPPARCOS distance and with\nan outflow velocity vo = 14.2 km s\u22121 . Throughout this study,\nwe adopt terminal outflow velocities from their work. For a\ndistance d of 150 p and an outflow velocity vo = 15 km s\u22121 ,\nDanchi et al. (1994) yield a mass-loss rate of 17 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nWith the HIPPARCOS parallax of 7.63 mas yielding a distance\nof 131 pc, and \u1e40 \u221d vo d, their mass-loss rate is updated to\n14 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is given in Table 4.\nObservational data We used low spectral resolution data\n\nfrom different catalogues available at the SIMBAD (2003)\n\n\fP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\nTable 4. Mass-loss rate comparison. The values for vo come\nfrom Knapp et al. (1998). Data from Danchi et al. were reevaluated at HIPPARCOS distance (see Table 1) following\n\u1e40 \u221d vo d.\n\n5\n\nAstronomical Database to constrain the SED over a large range\nof wavelengths. The TD1 catalogue provides fluxes around\n0.2 \u03bcm. UBV measurements are reported in the GEN and UBV\ncatalogues. Fluxes in the UBVRIJHKL bands are taken from\nthe JP11 Johnson catalogue. The 12, 25, 60, and 100 \u03bcm fluxes\nare from the IRAS catalogue, and Danchi et al. (1994) provide\nflux curves from 8 to 22 \u03bcm.\nFor Betelgeuse, having slight luminosity variations, we can\neasily compare visibility points from different epochs. This assumption will be fully justified by the fit we obtain.\n\nSED shows, stellar radiation is prominent over a large wavelength range. Flux emitted by dust becomes prominent only in\na small band around 10 \u03bcm.\nVisibility curves are also plotted in Fig. 1. The K and L\nband visibility curves from the dust shell model resemble each\nother and show good superposition with the respective visibility curves of the uniform disk model. Apparently, the same\nstructure is seen in these two bands. The SED plot indicates\nthat this should be the stellar photosphere since in these two\nbands the direct stellar flux is roughly 103 times larger than the\nscattered part and about 105 times larger than the dust emission.\nOne can conclude that the dust envelope, having a very small\noptical depth, has little influence on the intensity distribution\nat these wavelengths. The dust shell is transparent in K and L\nand the star is seen through the dust at these wavelengths. As a\nconsequence, the dust shell model derived from the ISI data is\nfully consistent with the FLUOR and TISIS measurements.\nAs a further consistency check, yet with minor priority, we\ncomputed a mass-loss rate \u1e40 from our model parameters by\na method similar to Danchi et al. (1994) (see Appendix A for\ndetails). With the set of parameters for \u03b1 Ori, we obtain a massloss rate of 17 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , consistent with Danchi et al.\n(1994) and roughly a factor of 5 higher than that of Knapp et al.\n(1998).\nAlthough \u03b1 Ori has the lowest optical depth of the studied\nobjects, its mass-loss rate seems to be the highest. The parameters used here indicate an episodic event in the past. Yet, since\nthis event the dust shell has expanded, with its enlarged inner\nradius entering the computation. For a further discussion of the\nmass-loss event see Danchi et al. (1994).\nWe now study the case of stars with circumstellar envelopes\nat higher optical depths.\n\nParameters Danchi et al.

This shell\nis supposed to have a small extent (ri = 45.9 R\u22c6, ro = 48.2 R\u22c6)\nquite far away from the central star and to be optically very\nthin (\u03c411 = 0.0065). It seems to indicate an episodic mass-loss\nprocess, leading to an empty area between the star and its envelope. We used these parameters (see Table 5) to reproduce\nthe shorter wavelength visibility points given by FLUOR and\nTISIS.\nThe effective stellar temperature of 3640 K used by Danchi\net al. (1994) is fully consistent with the evaluation by Perrin\net al. (2003a) giving 3640 K and 3690 K depending on models.\nThe stellar radius used in that model is 21.8 mas, satisfactorily\naccounting for both the photometric data and interferometric\ndata in the three bands. This radius is close to the uniform disk\nmodel radii in the K and L bands of 21.6 mas and 21.4 mas,\nrespectively.\nResults The SED of the model is shown in Fig. 1. Apart from\n\nthe total flux from the object, the plot also contains the contributions of the stellar flux attenuated by the circumstellar shell,\nthe distribution of the flux scattered by the dust grains in the\nshell (maximum at short wavelength), and the thermal emission of the grains (maximum at longer wavelength). As the\n\nThe pulsation period of this M7III semi-regular (SRb) variable\nstar is 150 days. Its main characteristics are recapitulated in\nTable 1. The mass-loss rate is estimated by Knapp et al. (1998)\nto 1.7 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nObservational data Photometric data are retrieved from the\n\nIRC catalogue for the I and K bands, from the UBV catalogue\nin the respective filters, from the IRAS catalogue at 12, 60,\n100 \u03bcm, and from Monnier et al. (1998) in the 8 to 13 \u03bcm\nrange. The M band flux at 5 \u03bcm comes from Wannier & Sahai\n(1986).\nTo date, no 11-\u03bcm interferometric data is available for\nSW Virginis. Benson et al. (1989) report observations by\nspeckle interferometry in the N band at spatial frequencies below 2 * 105 rad\u22121 . Since they do not provide measured data directly, but rather give some model parameters, this has not been\nconsidered here. It is therefore not possible to assess the consistency of the spatial model between all bands for this object.\nParameters For SW Vir, Perrin et al. (1998) give an effective\n\ntemperature of 2921 \u00b1 100 K, as derived from the bolometric flux and the limb-darkened diameter. Consistent with this\n\n\f6\n\nP.

From top left to bottom left: modelled visibility curve with interferometric data for the bands K, L,\nand N; bottom right: modelled spectral energy distribution with photometric data. Model parameters (see Table 5): T \u22c6 = 3640 K,\nR\u22c6 = 21.8 mas, ri = 45.9 R\u22c6, ro = 48.2 R\u22c6, and \u03c411 = 0.0065.\nvalue, the effective temperature was set to 2800 K. For the parameters of the dust shell we chose to adopt ri = 15.0 R\u22c6 and\nro = 1000 R\u22c6, as proposed by van der Veen et al. (1995) on\nthe basis of sub-mm observations. Applying an optical depth\n\u03c411 = 0.045 and assuming a stellar radius of 8.65 mas then\naccounts for flux data at low spectral resolution.\nDanchi et al. (1994) make a distinction between two classes\nof objects. The first class has a cold circumstellar envelope far\nfrom the star (beyond 10 stellar radii), while objects of the second class are surrounded by a warmer dust envelope, near the\nstar (at about 2 or 3 stellar radii). The mass-loss process is different for these two classes. For the second class, the mass-loss\nprocess is more continuous than for the first one. SW Virginis\n\nhas been classified in the past as a Mira star, hence with a somewhat regular mass-loss. Yet, its current classification as a semiregular variable, possibly a precursor of a Mira star, makes its\nmass-loss more likely to be irregular, consistently with its irregular photometric variations. It is therefore very tempting to\nidentify it as a member of the first class. The preferred set of parameters obtained for this star is summarised in Table 5. A large\noptical depth and a large shell extent are necessary to reproduce\nthe photometric contribution of dust at large wavelengths.\n\nResults As Fig. 2 shows, the contribution of dust emission to\n\nthe SED in the K and L bands of SW Virginis is more impor-\n\n\fP.

Top left and right: modelled visibility curve with interferometric data for the K and L bands;\nbottom left: expected visibility curve for the N band; bottom right: modelled spectral energy distribution with photometric data.\nModel parameters (see Table 5): T \u22c6 = 2800 K, R\u22c6 = 8.65 mas, ri = 15.0 R\u22c6, ro = 1000 R\u22c6, and \u03c411 = 0.045.\ntant than in the case of \u03b1 Ori, i.e., it is higher in relation to the\ndirect flux. This can be attributed to the larger optical depth.\nSW Virginis has some infrared excess that requires a dust shell.\nHowever, the dust cannot be too warm, otherwise it would produce a much larger infrared excess than is compatible with the\nSED.\nFrom this model, visibility curves were derived. Although\ncomparatively few visibility measurements are available for\nthis object, it is obvious that the single dust shell model is not\nsimultaneously compatible with the K and L band data. Again,\nmodel visibility curves are similar in K and L which lets us assume that we see the same structure, i.e. the stellar photosphere.\nThis is also reflected by the SED for which a similar reasoning\n\napplies like in the case of \u03b1 Ori. Indeed, the dust being quite\nfar away from the photosphere, the K band data are well reproduced by the visibility model. However, the dust is too cold and\noptically too thin to lead to a significant increase of the diameter at larger wavelengths compatible with the L band data. A\nsimple dust shell model, therefore, cannot account for both the\ninterferometric and the photometric data. Unfortunately, no ISI\ndata are available for this star. They would have been very useful to help model the dust shell and place stronger constraints\non it.\nThe mass-loss rate we obtain from our parameters is 1.4 *\n10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is roughly consistent with the one of\nKnapp et al. (1998).\n\n\f8\n\nP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\n4.3. A Mira-type variable: R Leonis\nR Leonis is a Mira-type long-period variable with a period of\n\u223c 310 days and of late spectral type M8IIIe (see Table 1). Its\nmass-loss rate is indicated by Knapp et al. (1998) as 0.94 *\n10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , whereas the estimate by Danchi et al. (1994)\ncan be updated to 0.60 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nR Leonis is known to have a very strong infrared excess\nand very steady pulsations which makes it very different from\nSW Virginis. R Leonis shows large photometric variations, especially at short wavelengths. The problem here is to synthesise a low spectral resolution SED, as well as visibility curves,\nfor a star with large photometric variations. Nevertheless, we\ndecided to include all available data points (both photometric\nand interferometric) into the plots despite the object variability\nwhich will allow a larger range of acceptable model parameters.\nObservational data For R Leonis, UBV measurements can be\n\nfound in the GEN and UBV catalogues. The JP11 Johnson catalogue provides magnitudes in the BVRIJKL bands. Strecker\net al. (1978) observed this object between 1.2 and 4.0 \u03bcm. The\nfluxes at 12, 20, 60 and 100 \u03bcm are from IRAS, and fluxes between 8 and 20 \u03bcm come from Danchi et al. (1994).\nParameters The effective temperature that accounts for the\n\nphotometric data is about 2500 K, a bit more than the temperature of 2000 K assumed by Danchi et al. (1994) for their\nmodel containing only silicate dust around R Leo. The stellar radius is clearly smaller (14.9 mas instead of 19.8 mas).\nHowever, we have estimated these two parameters with all data\ncombined (interferometric data in the K and N bands and the\nspectro-photometric data), and they show good consistency (in\nas much as the star is neither a perfect blackbody nor a uniform disk) with those derived from the K band interferometric\ndata alone by Perrin et al. (1999), who give uniform disk radii\nof at most \u223c 15 mas and photosphere effective temperatures\ncloser to 3000 K rather than 2000 K. Our effective temperature\nis larger than that of Danchi et al. which is not surprising since\nin their case only photometric data above 8 \u03bcm was used, i.e.,\nin a range of wavelengths very sensitive to cool dust emission.\nThis also explains why their stellar radius is larger: for a given\nbolometric flux, the stellar diameter increases with decreasing\ntemperature.\nAs in Danchi et al. (1994), we consider a large circumstellar envelope near the central star. But instead of 2 R\u22c6 for the\ninner edge of the dust shell, we chose 3.5 R\u22c6 to keep the temperature of the grains close to 1000 K, the assumed temperature\nof grain condensation. The overall parameters are summarised\nin Table 5.\nResults The fit of the photometric data described in the pre-\n\nvious section is displayed in Fig. 3. The contribution of the\nenvelope dominates beyond 10 \u03bcm up to about 30 \u03bcm. With a\nquite large extent, up to 140 R\u22c6 , and an optical depth \u03c411 = 0.1\nthe dust shell accounts for IRAS and Danchi et al. (1994)\nobservations in the long wavelength range. As can be no-\n\nticed in the graph, scattered flux and thermal dust emission\nare even more important than for SW Vir. This is apparently\ndue to the larger optical depth and the smaller inner radius\nof the envelope. These parameters lead to a mass-loss rate of\n0.77 * 10\u22127 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is of the same order of and intermediate between the values published by Danchi et al. (1994)\nand Knapp et al. (1998) (see Table 4).\nVisibility curves gained from this model are also shown in\nFig. 3 for the K, L, and N bands respectively. The stellar radius derived from our model is 14.9 mas, much smaller than\nthe 19.8 mas of Danchi et al. (1994). Since our study is based\non interferometric data spanning a wider range of wavelengths,\nthe parameters we derive are different from that of Danchi et al.\n(1994) The ISI data are better suited to characterise the dust,\nyet the shorter-wavelength data bring more accurate stellar parameters, hence explaining the discrepancies between the two\nstudies. The dust envelope structure may be considered as stationary with little sensitivity to stellar pulsation. FLUOR observations at phase 0.28 (March 1997) in K band give a uniform\ndisk radius of 15.34 mas (Perrin et al. 1999). In principle, the K\nband measurements are more sensitive to regions very close to\nthe photosphere. It therefore seems that the radius of R Leonis\nshould be smaller than the evaluations by Danchi et al. (1994)\nand the difference between our estimate and that of Danchi\net al. cannot be attributed to the star pulsation. This difference\nmust be attributed to the difference of effective temperatures.\nWe now compare interferometric data in the K and L band\nand that of ISI. Our parameters are still consistent with the ISI\nvisibility points at 11 \u03bcm and account for FLUOR observations\nin the K band at low spatial frequencies. It is to be noticed that,\nsince the ISI visibility data are at low spatial frequencies, they\nare not as sensitive to the different models as are the visibilities\nat shorter wavelengths. This explains why they are consistent\nwith both the Danchi et al. (1994) and our model. On the other\nhand, in the L band our model overestimates the measured visibility values. As in the case of SW Vir, it appears that the large\nstructure seen in the L band is not well accounted for by a simple dust shell model, despite the even larger optical depth. Also\nthe SED shows that contributions from the dust shell are at least\na factor 102 below the direct stellar flux. A larger radius could\nexplain both 3.6 \u03bcm and 11 \u03bcm observations, but would disagree with K band measurements and the SED.\n\n5. Discussion\n\n5.1. Obtained results\nFrom what we have seen so far, the best consistency between\nthe multiple band data and the dust shell model is obtained for\n\u03b1 Ori. The model described by Danchi et al. (1994) has a stellar\nradius close to the K and L radii estimated with a uniform disk\nmodel. Yet, in this case the influence of the envelope is not\nvery important because of its small thickness and low opacity.\nNevertheless, model parameters for ISI data from Danchi et al.\nare consistent with what we see both for K and L bands.\nOne may note, however, that Weiner et al. (2000) report further ISI data on \u03b1 Ori which are not fully consistent with the\nmodel of Danchi et al. based on observations at low spatial fre-\n\n\fP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\n9\n\nFig. 3. Model output for R Leo. From top left to bottom left: modelled visibility curve with interferometric data for the bands K, L,\nand N; bottom right: modelled spectral energy distribution with photometric data. Model parameters (see Table 5): T \u22c6 = 2500 K,\nR\u22c6 = 14.9 mas, ri = 3.5 R\u22c6, ro = 140 R\u22c6, and \u03c411 = 0.1.\nquencies. Weiner et al. took their measurements at higher spatial frequencies where the dust shell is fully resolved. Its contribution to the visibility is therefore negligible and the observed\ndata are governed by radiation coming directly from the star or\nfrom its close environment. Like the L band data of SW Vir and\nR Leo (see below), the data of Weiner et al. are overestimated\nby the dust shell model. These findings are further discussed in\nPerrin et al. (2003a).\nFor AGB stars with later types like SW Vir and R Leo, for\nwhich we measure large diameter differences between 2.15 \u03bcm\nand 3.77 \u03bcm (the approximate effective wavelengths of the\nFLUOR and TISIS instruments), a simple dust shell model cannot account for these differences. However, the shape of near-\n\ninfrared visibility curves for SW Vir and R Leo seem to show a\ntrend. L band visibility points are systematically overestimated\nby a simple dust shell model meaning the source is larger than\npredicted by the model. This shows that the stellar environment\nmainly seen at this wavelength is much more complex than suggested by a model that takes into account only the star and its\ndust envelope.\nIndeed, the temperature of this area is close to the temperature at which grains form. Consequently, we must also take the\npresence of gas into account in modelling. Doing this will radically change the radiation transfer behaviour. Recently, spectroscopic detection of SiO, OH, and H2 O masers in late-type\nstar envelopes have revealed the necessity of modelling the\n\n\f10\n\nP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\ngas to explain large diameters seen in L band. ISO/SWS and\nother studies (Tsuji et al. (1997); Yamamura et al. (1999); Tsuji\n(2000) brought up the existence of molecular layers of warm\nand cold H2 O, SiO, and CO2 around AGB stars. Such layers\nin AGB stars certainly exist and have an impact on the stellar\nradiation which is observed by infrared interferometers. Strong\nmolecular scattering by H2 O and CO were suggested to account for K band visibility measurements of R Leo by FLUOR\nin 1997 (Perrin et al. 1999) and seem to explain more easily\nthe near-infrared measurements (Mennesson et al. 2002; Perrin\net al. 2003b). It is very likely that dust needs to be coupled with\ngas to produce a more reliable model of these sources and that\ndust alone cannot be the only cause of the measurements taken\nin a wide range of wavelengths. The inclusion of a detailed photospheric model with line opacity due to gas would improve the\nagreement of the SED, particularly in the blue, and would improve the discrimination between stellar and shell components.\n\n5.2. Data used\nCertain aspects of our study can be further weighed.\nSimultaneous interferometric data would certainly help constrain models more accurately. Same epoch measurements are\nneeded because of the large diameter variations of AGB stars.\nAt least for the position angles it can be noted, though, that\nthey are fairly close in range, which leaves little possibility that\nthe discrepancy we see may be explained by an elliptical shape\n(see below). Furthermore, 11.15-\u03bcm data would have been very\nuseful to see whether our SW Vir dust model parameters are\ncorrect since the envelope has more impact on the model at this\nwavelength. Such data might be provided in the near future by\nsingle-dish instruments on 10-m class telescopes or by upcoming mid-infrared interferometers like MIDI at the VLTI.\n\nclumps or aspherical dust distributions, as they were investigated, for example, by Lopez et al. (1997). These have not\nbeen tested here and require more intense visibility modelling.\nThis would be definitely required if sources showed systematic asymmetric effects, yet which are likely to produce ringing\nfeatures on top of a visibility curve compared to the more basic effect of radiative transfer in spherical shells. Nevertheless,\nclosure phase observations could help test for asymmetries.\nAs for the dust particle material, slightly differing optical\nproperties were proposed by several authors. See, for example,\nSuh (1999) for a comparison of optical properties of silicate\ndust grains in the envelopes around AGB stars. We chose the\nones of Draine & Lee (1984) which are widely used. Using optical properties suggested by Suh (1999) for comparison made\nit necessary to choose different dust shell parameters in order\nto achieve reasonable consistency with ISI data. Yet, L band\ndata were still overestimated, similar to Fig. 3. Another issue\nmight be the dust composition. For example, for R Leo, Danchi\net al. (1994) tested also a mixture of silicates and graphites.\nYet, this led to a required stellar radius in the dust shell model\nalmost twice as large as observed in the K band, which is supposedly sensitive to the region close to the stellar photosphere.\nTherefore, this has not been further investigated here. A third\naspect might be the condensation temperature T cond that we\nadopted. Some authors chose higher T cond , see, for example,\nWillson (2000) for an overview. Taking R Leo as study case,\nwe set ri = 2 R\u22c6 and chose ro and an optical depth \u03c411 so that\nalso ISI data were well fitted. The output of the model showed\na somewhat increased IR excess around 11 \u03bcm, and the temperature at the inner radius turned out to be about 1400 K.\nStill, while the SED, K band, and ISI data were reasonably well\nfitted, the modelled visibility curve in the L band was clearly\nhigher than the measured data, similar to Fig. 3.\nIn summary, we do not believe the aspects mentioned above\nto affect our conclusions significantly.\n\n5.3. Model code parameters\nA limitation of the model as used for this study is that it does\nnot consider heterogeneous grain size distributions s(a) depending upon the distance from the star or temporal effects\n(like grain formation, growth, or destruction). Also, different\nlimits of the grain radius a might have affected the fit of the\nSED in the UV and the far-infrared. Yet, varying the grain size\nrange from 0.005\u22120.25 \u03bcm to 0.005\u22122.5 \u03bcm and 0.05\u22122.5 \u03bcm\nfor R Leo as a study case, the resulting diagrams showed\nonly small changes. It appeared that, in the modelled visibility curves for the K and L bands, the contribution of spatial\nfrequencies below 20 * 105 rad\u22121 were somewhat increased.\nAbove all, neither the star nor the envelope are ideal blackbodies which adds to these deviations.\nConcerning the particle density distribution n(r), Suh\n(1999) questions the necessity of assuming a distribution which\nis peaked at the inner edge. Indeed, comparing results of calculations with two sets of parameters that differ only in n(r)\nshowed only minor changes in K and L bands. For 11.15 \u03bcm,\nchanges were somewhat clearer, whereby for \u03b1 Ori and R Leo\nthe accelerated version fitted ISI data better. Other issues are\nthe possible existence of smaller structures in the envelope like\n\n6. Conclusions\nHigh angular resolution techniques give important constraints\non spatial intensity distribution of late-type stars. Using diameter measurements in the K and L bands, we have tried to explain both K and L observations for three stars surrounded by\ncircumstellar envelopes with different optical depths. We applied a model with a single dust shell and consistent with low\nresolution photometric data as well as thermal infrared interferometry data from ISI when available.\nFor the supergiant Betelgeuse, the optically very thin dust\nshell has little influence on what is seen and is transparent in\nthe K and L bands. The observed diameters are almost equal. In\ncontrast, the AGB stars SW Vir and R Leo show bigger diameters in the L band than in the K band. Here, the optical depths\nof the shells are larger and near-infrared model visibilities react\nquite sensitively on changes of the dust shell parameters. Yet,\nthe models we find in agreement with the SED, K band interferometry, and the specially dust-sensitive 11 \u03bcm interferometry\ncannot reproduce the observed diameter differences.\nOur study leads to the conclusion of the insufficiency of a\nsimple shell model with dust only or without more complex\n\n\fP. Schuller et al.: Dust shell models and interferometric data of late-type stars in the near-infrared\n\nstructures. New observations at several wavelengths from visible to far-infrared would help understand better external envelopes of AGB stars. A denser coverage of the spatial frequency plane will also be very useful to strongly constrain\nmodels. Interferometric observations with higher spectral resolution could enable to localise molecular components of these\nenvelopes and certainly help explain differences between K and\nL band.\n\nAppendix A: Evaluation of the mass-loss rate\nLet \u1e40dust be the constant mass-loss rate of dust ejected from\nthe star, md the average single dust grain mass, and n(r) the\ndust particle density, then at the inner edge ri of the dust shell\nit holds that\n4\u03c0ri2 dr\n\n* md n(ri )\n= 4\u03c0ri2 vi md ni ,\n(A.1)\ndt\nwhere vi is the dust outflow velocity and ni = n(ri ) the particle\ndensity.\nIn the dust shell, the particle density of grains is assumed\nas (Schutte & Tielens 1989; Danchi et al. 1994)\n\u1e40dust =\n\nr2\n1\nn(r) = ni * f (r) = ni * i2 *\nr (1 \u2212 A * ri /r)1/2\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere the parameter\nA = 1 \u2212 (vi /vo )2\n\n(A.3)\n\ncan be adapted to different cases. It is zero, if vi is assumed\nto equal the terminal outflow velocity vo of the dust far away\nfrom the star. In this case, the particle density simply follows\nn(r) \u221d r\u22122 . For taking into account acceleration of the dust by\nradiation pressure and coupling with the gas, vo will be higher\nthan vi . The parameter A will then be larger than in the first\ncase and the particle density much more pronounced at ri . In\nthe present study we chose A = 0.99, which applies for typical\nconditions (Danchi et al. 1994).\nThe optical depth \u03c4\u03bb of the envelope is determined by\nZ ro\nCext (\u03bb)n(r) dr\n\u03c4\u03bb =\nri\nZ ro\n= Cext (\u03bb) ni\nf (r) dr,\n(A.4)\nri\n\nwhere n(r) was replaced by (A.2). Cext is the average extinction mean section of the dust grains. Replacing ni in (A.1) by\nexpression (A.4) yields a relation for the mass-loss rate by dust:\n\u1e40dust =\n\n4\u03c0ri2 vi md \u03c4\u03bb\nR ro\n.\nCext (\u03bb) r f (r) dr\n\n(A.5)\n\ni\n\nIn the previous two expressions, ri , ro , and \u03c4\u03bb are the chosen model parameters. Cext is calculated in the modelling code\nfor a given grain size distribution from the optical properties\nof the dust by Mie theory (Niccolini et al. 2003). Likewise, the\nintegral in (A.5) is performed by the code. The dust grain mass\nmd has to be estimated by averaging the size distribution s(a)\nand defining the mass density. For the presently considered silicate dust, we chose as \u03c1d = 3.3 g cm\u22123 (also used by Draine\n\n11\n\n& Lee (1984) and Danchi et al. (1994)). The terminal velocity of the shell particles is taken from high-spectral resolution\nobservations of CO lines (Knapp et al. 1998).\nFurthermore, for the total mass-loss rate also the gas has to\nbe taken into account, i.e.,\n\u1e40total = \u1e40dust + \u1e40gas .\n\n(A.6)\n\nGas-to-dust mass ratios are not well known and differ quite a\nlot. We adopted here, as typical value and assuming dust and\ngas to have the same terminal velocities (Schutte & Tielens\n1989; Danchi et al. 1994; Habing 1996),\n\u1e40gas \u2248 250 \u1e40dust.\n\n(A.7)\n\nThis means that most of the mass-loss is carried by gas. For\n\u1e40gas , an expression analogous to (A.1) can be given where vo\nenters for vi . Considering (A.7), and therefore neglecting the\nmass-loss carried by dust, the total mass-loss rate is eventually\n\u1e40total = 250\n\n4\u03c0ri2 vo md \u03c4\u03bb\nR ro\n.\nCext (\u03bb) r f (r) dr\n\n(A.8)\n\ni\n\nAcknowledgements.
