Not utilized by that study were two additional, topologically very similar, categories\nfor which further analysis was needed to separate the samples and to eliminate their nonneutrino background. Using nomenclature introduced by the MACRO experiment [2], the\ntwo categories are labelled as UpStop events and InDown events.\nUpStop events are upward-going stopping muons which arise from charged-current \u03bd\u03bc and\n\u03bd \u03bc interactions occurring in the rock surrounding the Soudan 2 cavern; only the final state\nmuon is detected as a stopping, non-interacting track in the detector. The muon may be\naccompanied by a small number of hits from a decay electron near its stopping point.\nInDown events are \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bd \u03bc interactions in the detector yielding downward going, exiting\nmuons with three or fewer hits arising from hadronic track(s) at the production vertex.\nApproximately 65% of these InDown events are quasi-elastic interactions with low energy\nprotons. Interactions having more than three hadronic hits at their primary vertex were\nincluded in the PC sample analyzed previously [1].\nSeparation of these two neutrino event samples is made possible by the fine-grain imaging\nof the Soudan-2 honeycomb-lattice tracking calorimeter. Their angular distributions exhibit\nfeatures which are indicative of atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations. The samples can be\nincorporated in a straightforward way into the likelihood analysis described in Ref. [1]. Their\ninclusion has enabled an improved determination of the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillation parameters from\nthis experiment and a more stringent rejection of the no oscillation hypothesis.\nAnalyses of upward through-going muons [2, 3, 4, 5], and stopping muons [2, 4, 6, 7]\nhave been previously reported. Whereas through-going muon samples originate from a broad\nhigh-energy neutrino spectrum having a mean E\u03bd of approximately 100 GeV, UpStop events\noriginate predominantly from interactions with 1 \u2264 E\u03bd \u2264 20 GeV. Consequently they provide\ndifferent constraints for oscillation scenarios. Among the underground tracking calorimeter\nexperiments, MACRO has provided the most detailed treatment to date of UpStop and\nInDown events. In that experiment it was not possible to separate the two categories, so they\nwere analyzed as a combined sample. Clearly, it is advantageous to separate the samples,\nsince comparison of their zenith angle distributions can provide additional discrimination\nbetween low (\u2248 10\u22123 eV2 ) versus high (\u2265 10\u22122 eV2 ) values of \u2206m2 .\n\n2\n\nDetector and data exposure\n\nSoudan 2 was a 963 metric ton (770 tons fiducial) iron tracking calorimeter with a honeycomb\ngeometry which operated as a time-projection chamber. The detector was located at a depth\nof 2070 meters\u2013water\u2013equivalent on the 27th level of the Soudan Underground Mine State\nPark in northern Minnesota. The calorimeter started data taking in April 1989 and ceased\noperation in June 2001 by which time a total exposure (fiducial exposure) of 7.36 kton-years\n(5.90 kton-years) had been obtained.\n\n2\n\n\fThe calorimeter's tracking elements were 1 m long, 1.5 cm diameter hytrel plastic drift\ntubes filled with an argon-CO2 gas mixture. The tubes were encased in a honeycomb matrix\nof 1.6 mm thick corrugated steel plates. Electrons deposited in the gas by the passage of\ncharged particles drifted to the tube ends under the influence of an electric field. At the\ntube ends the electrons were amplified by vertical anode wires which read out a column\nof tubes. A horizontal cathode strip read out the induced charge and the third coordinate\nwas provided by the drift time. The ionization deposited was measured by the anode pulse\nheight. The calorimeter produced three-dimensional track hits with a spatial resolution of\napproximately 1 cm3 and separated by an average of about 3 mm of steel. The corrugated\nplates, interleaved with drift tubes, were stacked to form 1\u00d71\u00d72.5 m3 , 4.3-ton modules from\nwhich the calorimeter was assembled in building-block fashion [8].\nSurrounding the tracking calorimeter on all sides, but mounted on the cavern surfaces\nand well separated from the outer surfaces of the calorimeter, was a 1700 m2 Veto Shield\narray of two or three layers of proportional tubes [9]. The shield recorded the presence of\ncosmic ray muons coincident in time with events in the main calorimeter and thus identified\nbackground events, either produced directly by the muons or initiated by secondary particles\ncoming from muon interactions in the rock walls of the cavern. Additionally, for neutrinoinduced muons which enter or exit the tracking calorimeter, the shield array recorded the\nmuon in time-coincidence with the event in the central detector.\n\n3\n\nSeparation of UpStop and InDown Events\n\nThe event imaging afforded by the Soudan 2 tracking calorimeter made it possible to distinguish the topologically similar UpStop and InDown events. Events of both types were\nisolated during routine processing.\nEvents were classified as UpStop candidates if they satisfied the following criteria:\n(1) The track was muon-like, devoid of kinks or scatter vertices.\n(2) The track length was greater than 100 cm.\n(3) The muon endpoint occured in a live detector region. An event was removed if the\ncandidate endpoint occured in the inactive region between modules.\n(4) Track ionization and straggling were consistent with the hypothesis of an upward-going\nmuon which ranges to stopping. That is, near the edge of the detector the track was\nstraight and lightly ionizing while, near the interior end, the track exhibited multiple\nscattering and/or heavy ionization.\n(5) Associated hits at the track endpoint, if any, had to be consistent with an electron\nshower from muon decay.\nAn anode-versus-cathode view of an UpStop data event is shown in Fig. 1 where multiple\nscattering can be discerned as the muon ranges to stopping. Endpoint decay hits, the three\nhits modestly displaced from the muon endpoint in Fig. 1, are observed in some events (with\nhigher probability for \u03bc+ than for \u03bc\u2212 since the former do not undergo nuclear absorption\nwithin iron nuclei).\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: An UpStop data event recorded in the anode-cathode matched view (front view of the calorimeter).\nTypically, multiple scattering becomes pronounced as the muon approaches its range endpoint. The endpoint\ndecay shower of three hits favors identification as a \u03bc+ rather than a \u03bc\u2212 .\n\nInDown events were required to satisfy criteria 1-3 above and in addition:\n(4) The muon track was straight and lightly ionizing at its interior end. Near the edge of\nthe detector the track might, but need not, have exhibited ranging behavior in the form\nof multiple scattering and/or heavy ionization.\n(5) Associated hits near the interior end of the track, if present, must have been consistent\nwith hits from a proton or \u03c0 \u00b1 track, lying in a straight line and heavily ionizing.\nThese topological features are exhibited by the InDown data event shown in Fig. 2. At\nthe event vertex, the muon is accompanied by a track of two hits for which the ionization is\nrelatively heavy. This pattern is typical of a recoil proton. The event of Fig. 2 is a candidate\nquasi-elastic \u03bd\u03bc n \u2192 \u03bc\u2212 p.\nThere were a few events which could not be resolved as UpStop or InDown, the direction\nof the track being undetermined. Fortunately, ambiguous cases were rare for tracks which\nhave visible lengths exceeding one meter in the detector. For the purpose of analysis, such\nevents were retained as an Ambiguous category.\n\n4\n\nEvent processing and simulation\n\nBoth UpStop and InDown data events were selected in the Partially Contained event sample,\nand were processed as described in Ref. [1]. The Monte Carlo sample of the contained-vertex\nInDown events was also part of the routine data processing, in which Monte-Carlo events\n4\n\n\fFigure 2: An InDown data event recorded in the cathode versus time view (calorimeter side view). The\nmuon emerges from an event vertex which is well contained; its trajectory, a straight line initially, undergoes\nsmall angle deflection as the ranging muon approaches the detector floor. A proton recoil of two hits is\nvisible at the vertex.\n\nwere inserted into and processed together with the data stream, their identity only being\nrevealed in the final analysis stage. However, additional simulations, not included in the\nmain data processing, were needed for the neutrino interactions in the rock surrounding the\ncavern, which give rise to UpStop events [10].\n4.1\n\nSimulation of upward-stopping muon events\n\nThe GEANT Monte Carlo program together with modified Soudan-2 software provided the\nUpStop simulation (UpStop-MC). A total of 68.7 million neutrino interactions in greenstone\nrock were simulated. The event vertices were distributed randomly through rock volumes\nwhich were centered on the Soudan 2 cavern. Since high-energy charged-current (CC) events\ncan project muons to the cavern from more remote rock than low-energy events, the dimensions of the primary rock volumes were chosen to increase with increasing E\u03bd . Final-state\nparticles were tracked through the rock by GEANT and fourvectors of particles that reached\nthe veto-shield array were saved. These were then passed through the Soudan-2 Monte Carlo\nto produce realistic detector hits superimposed on detector noise represented by randomtrigger records.\nUpStop-MC events were then processed through the standard Soudan-2 triggering, reconstruction and selection software for PC events. For UpStop-MC events yielding ionization\nwithin the tracking calorimeter (71,000 events), the survival rates decreased monotonically\nwith increasing primary E\u03bd , reflecting the diminishing probability for muons from energetic\nevents to stop in the detector. Survival rates ranged from 12.8% for events with E\u03bd \u2264 10\n5\n\n\fGeV, to 2.5% for events with E\u03bd \u2265 40 GeV.\n4.2\n\nUpStop cuts and scanning\n\nThe PC selection filter required candidate tracks to penetrate to the fiducial region while\nnot being through-going. Additional requirements, detailed in Ref. [1], were imposed in\norder to reject the high-flux background of downward-going cosmic-ray muons. A total of\n7662 UpStop-MC events passed the filter and simulated trigger requirements. However, only\n34% of these events yielded a potentially interesting topology in the detector. Consequently,\nadditional cuts were applied to the true kinematic variables to reject those events which\nwere certain not to pass the subsequent analysis cuts. These cuts (existence of a final-state\nmuon with cosine zenith angle, cos \u03b8z < +0.05, and energy E\u03bc upon arrival at the detector\nwithin the range 350 MeV < E\u03bc < 3500 MeV) were designed to ensure that the event had\nan upward-going muon that stopped within the calorimeter fiducial volume [10]. A 54%\nsample of the surviving events was then scanned by physicists, using scanning rules identical\nto those used for PC data event scanning. The additional criteria given in Sec. 3 were also\napplied to both data and MC events. All events which satisfied the scanning criteria were\nthen reconstructed manually using the experiment's standard interactive graphics software.\nOnly the reconstructed sample was used in the subsequent analysis. It contained a factor of\n25 more events than the data sample.\n4.3\n\nMC event rate normalization\n\nThe atmospheric neutrino flux used to generate the UpStop events was the one-dimensional\ncalculation of the Bartol group [11], modulated by the solar cycle as described in Ref. [1].\nOther fluxes were simulated by applying correctional weights to the generated events. For\nconsistency with Ref. [1], the numbers and plots in Sects. 5 and 6 were weighted to correspond to the updated 1D Bartol-96 flux [12]. The oscillation analysis of Sect. 7 of this\npaper used the latest three-dimensional fluxes from the Bartol group [13] and Battistoni et\nal. [14]. The neutrino cross sections were those encoded in NEUGEN3 [15]. The target\nnuclear composition was that of Soudan rock, described in Ref. [16]. The effect of Pauli\nblocking in elastic and quasi-elastic reactions was accounted for, however nuclear effects on\nresonance production and on deep inelastic scattering final states were neglected.\nThe event rate calculations have a sizable systematic error. For the comparison of this\ndata with the MC presented in Sections 5 and 6, a normalization factor of 0.85, determined\nfrom the measured \u03bde rate, assuming no oscillations, was applied. In the oscillation analysis\ndescribed in Sec. 7 the overall normalization was a free \"nuisance\" parameter.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nEvent rates and backgrounds\nBackgrounds in UpStop events\n\nTwo sources of background events were considered:\n\n6\n\n\f(1) Cosmic-ray muons which scatter in the rock and eventually enter the detector in an\nupward direction.\n(2) Charged hadronic tracks, especially pions, produced at large angles in interactions of\ncosmic-ray muons in the rock surrounding the detector.\nUnlike experiments which are situated under mountains, the flat overburden at Soudan\nensures that the flux of cosmic-ray muons becomes less than the flux of neutrino-produced\nmuons significantly above horizontal angles [16]. Thus the background from the first source\nis negligible.\nHadronic interactions of neutrons produced in cosmic ray interactions were shown in Ref.\n[1] to be a background to contained neutrino events. A similar, related, flux of charged\nhadrons also emerges from the cavern walls and enters the detector.\nThere are two distinguishing features of entering hadronic tracks:\n(1) Veto-Shield signal: In addition to the Veto Shield hit corresponding to the passage of\nthe hadron track, there are likely to be extra hits due to other particles produced in\nthe muon interaction. In general, the track in the detector will not be aligned with\nthese extra hits. It is thus useful to distinguish between the total number of in-time\nVeto Shield hits (nVallS ) and the number of in-time hits geometrically associated with the\nincoming/leaving track (nVtrkS ).\n(2) Range: Hadronic tracks have a limited range in the detector before stopping or interacting.\n\nFigure 3: Distributions of Veto-Shield hit counts versus track range, (a) for UpStop data candidates and (b)\nfor UpStop Monte Carlo events, prior to muon length cuts.\n\nFig. 3 shows nVallS versus the range of the stopping track for each event of the UpStop data\n(Fig. 3a) and of the MC (Fig. 3b). A clear excess of data events with large nVallS and small\n7\n\n\fFigure 4: Distribution of track range for candidate UpStop data events (crosses) compared to the neutrino\nMonte Carlo sample (shaded histogram), for events with visible track length exceeding one meter. The\ndistributions (normalized to the events with > 500 g/cm2 ) are shown (a) before and (b) after the requirement\nnVallS = nVtrkS has been applied. Fig. 4b shows good agreement between the data and the neutrino MC.\n\nrange is observed, corresponding to the expectation for incoming hadronic tracks. However,\nat track lengths beyond the hadronic range, the data is consistent with the UpStop MC. The\nbackground signature is emphasized in Fig. 4a which shows the projection onto the range\naxis of the UpStop data (points with errors) and the MC (shaded histogram). The MC is\nnormalized to the data with range > 500 g/cm2 (> 3.8 pion interaction lengths). Fig. 4b\nshows the same distributions but with the additional constraint that nVallS = nVtrkS , i.e. all\nVeto-Shield hits must be geometrically associated with the incoming track. The MC is then\nin good agreement with the data. However, to ensure that the residual hadronic background\nis negligible, a cut requiring the track range to be greater than 260 g/cm2 , corresponding to\n\n8\n\n\ftwo pion interaction lengths, is also applied. Since the calorimeter is, to good approximation,\na uniform medium of 1.6 g/cm3 density, the range requirement corresponds to a minimum\ntrack length requirement of \u223c160 cm. The effective muon momentum threshold for UpStop\nand InDown events is p\u03bc \u2265 530 MeV/c.\nFinally, the cosine of the zenith angle, cos\u03b8z , of the reconstructed UpStop track is required\nto be smaller than +0.05.\n5.2\n\nUpStop backgrounds using hadronic scatter events\n\nThe PC data analysis also recorded events with an incoming track making a hadronic scatter.\nA sample of 25 data events was obtained which can be used to gauge the background from\nincoming non-scattering hadrons. A representative event is the upward-going, stopping,\ncharged pion track shown in Fig. 5. There are two coincident hits in the shield which are\nin close proximity to the track's entrance point into the cavern, hence nVtrkS = 2. There is an\nadditional coincident hit in the shield floor, hence nVallS = 3. Inside the detector, the track\nscatters and stops. The scatter, which gives rise to a recoil proton, plus the track ionization,\nidentifies the track as a \u03c0 \u00b1 rather than a \u03bc\u00b1 or a proton.\n\nFigure 5: A scattering upgoing pion track (data event) accompanied by three time-coincident Veto Shield\nhits.\n\nDistributions of cos\u03b8z and of track range versus nVallS for the incoming hadronic sample are\nshown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6a shows that most of the events are downgoing. Among the seven\n9\n\n\fFigure 6: Distributions of (a) cos\u03b8z and (b) the number of coincident veto shield hits versus the track range,\nfor events which exhibit hadronic scatters. In Fig. 6(a), the shaded (open) histogram includes events where\nall the in-time Veto-Shield hits are (are not) associated with the detected track.\n\nupward-going tracks, five have nVallS > nVtrkS (open histogram); the remaining two events with\nnVallS = nVtrkS (shaded histogram) are close to horizontal, and have short range. No hadronic\nevents pass the shield and track length selections for upgoing tracks (ignoring their visible\nscatters). On the basis of this observation, plus the agreement in track range distributions\nbetween the UpStop data and the neutrino MC of Fig. 4, backgrounds from non-scattering\ncharged pions and protons are estimated to contribute less than two events to the UpStop\ndata and are hereafter neglected.\n5.3\n\nBackgrounds in InDown events\n\nA potential background for InDown events arises from downward, through-going cosmic ray\nmuons whose entrance into the detector was not detected due to a rare episode of poor or nonexistent ionization drifting within a calorimeter module. Great care was taken to record all\nsuch incidents during data taking and additional checks were made by studying individual\nmodule efficiencies as a function of time. A special scan was carried out which rejected\nevents for which there was a possibility of such an occurrence. Additional discrimination\nagainst this background was provided by the active shield array, since through-going muons\nyielded pairs of time-coincident hits having widely separated spatial locations. Using the\nsame minimum track range as was used for the UpStop sample (\u2265 260 g/cm2 ), no InDown\nevents had nVallS > nVtrkS . Other backgrounds for PC events were shown to be negligible in Ref.\n[1], thus the InDown sample was assumed to be background-free in the analysis presented\nbelow.\n\n10\n\n\f5.4\n\nEvent rates\n\nA final sample of 1081 fully reconstructed UpStop-MC events was retained for subsequent\nanalysis. Within this simulation sample, 80% of events originate with neutrino interactions\nhaving E\u03bd \u2264 10 GeV. Charged-current quasi-elastic scattering accounts for about one third\nof the interactions. The neutrino fraction \u03bd\u03bc /(\u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd \u03bc ) of the sample is 64%.\nThe numbers of candidate data neutrino events which survive are listed in Table 1, where\nthe MC numbers have been scaled to an exposure of 5.90 fiducial kton-years and include the\nfactor of 0.85 to normalize to the \u03bde event rate of Ref. [1]. Comparison of the data with\nthe neutrino MC predictions, the sum of columns 2 and 3, shows that the observed InDown\nrate is consistent with the prediction, whereas the UpStop data rate appears suppressed by\na factor of approximately two. These trends are in agreement with the expectation from the\noscillation analysis of Ref. [1]. Note also the small size of the ambiguous sample and the\nsmall misidentification rate between the UpStop and InDown samples.\nTable 1: Numbers of data and Monte Carlo events which pass all cuts. The no-oscillation MC event rate is\nnormalized to the measured e-flavor event rate of Ref. [1] assuming no oscillations.\n\nAssigned as\nInDown\nUpStop\nAmbig\n\n6\n\nNo-osc.

In contrast, the InDown events have\nlower E\u03bd values with an average of 2.4 GeV.\n\nFigure 7: Comparison of the primary E\u03bd spectra for UpStop and InDown events.\n\n11\n\n\fThe muon track provides a good estimator for the incident neutrino direction. For UpStop\nevents the average angle between the incoming neutrino and the muon is 11\u25e6 . For the lower\nenergy InDown sample, the average angle is 13\u25e6 .\nIn the likelihood analysis of Ref. [1], the variable log10 (L/E) was used, where L is the\nneutrino pathlength in kilometers and E is the neutrino final state visible energy in GeV.\nAs demonstrated in Ref. [1], multiple scattering of the exiting muon in PC events allows\nsufficient neutrino energy determination to permit the reconstruction of the log10 (L/E) distribution. Fig. 8 shows the log10 (L/E) distribution for InDown data (crosses) compared to\nthe no-oscillation MC. The solid-line histogram represents the sum of the partially-contained\nInDown events from the contained-vertex PC Monte Carlo (PC-MC, dark shading), plus\nmisidentified UpStop-MC events (light shading). Good agreement is observed between the\ndata and the unoscillated Monte Carlo. Hence no evidence is found for oscillations in \u03bd\u03bc\natmospheric neutrinos which are incident from directions above the horizon.\n\nFigure 8: Distribution of log10 (L/E) for the InDown events. The data are shown as crosses; the solid-line\nhistogram shows the neutrino MC expectation for no oscillations. The MC prediction arises mostly from\ncontained vertex PC events (PC-MC, dark shading), but receives a small contribution from UpStop-MC\nevents which were misidentified as InDowns (light shading).\n\nFor the UpStop events, however, the whole of the hadronic-shower energy plus a fraction of\nthe muon energy is missing. Thus, whereas L can be calculated accurately from cos\u03b8z , E is essentially undetermined. The average difference between log10 (L/E)\u03bd and log10 (L/E)\u03bc is 0.69\n(FWHM=0.66), spanning four bins used in the oscillation analysis. Therefore log10 (L/E)\nis not a useful variable for analysis of oscillations in these events. In this section we show\ndata as a function of cos\u03b8z . In the analysis described in Section 7 it is convenient to fit\nas a function of log10 L. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of cos\u03b8z for upward-stopping muon\ndata events. The distribution decreases steadily towards the nadir. Fig. 9 also includes\nthe simulated UpStop-MC (light shading) and the misidentified contained-vertex PC-MC\n12\n\n\fFigure 9: Distribution of cos\u03b8z for the UpStop events. The crosses represent the data, and the solid-line\nhistogram shows the expected MC distribution for no oscillations. Light and dark-shaded areas show the\ncontributions of UpStop and InDown events for no oscillations.\n\n(dark shading) distributions, for the no-oscillation case. Significant disagreement between\nthe neutrino UpStop events and the no-oscillation expectation is apparent towards the nadir,\nwhich is consistent with the loss of upward-going \u03bc-flavor events due to oscillations.\nThe distributions of Figs. 8 and 9 imply constraints on neutrino oscillation scenarios.\nThese samples have been included in a likelihood analysis together with all the other neutrino\nevents from the experiment. The method and the results of this global fit to Soudan-2\nneutrino data are described in Section 7 below.\n\n7\n7.1\n\nOscillation analysis\nOutline of the method\n\nThe oscillation analysis is a bin-free likelihood analysis based on the prescription of Feldman\nand Cousins [17]. A detailed description of the method can be found in Ref. [1] and is not\nrepeated here. The main points of the analysis are:\n(1) As reported in Ref. [7] and confirmed by Ref. [1], the distributions of neutrino-induced\ne-flavor data events are consistent with the null oscillation MC predictions, up to an\noverall normalization. Only the \u03bc-flavor data exhibit oscillation effects. Thus this\nanalysis assumes two flavor \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillations.\n(2) The FC and PC samples described in Ref. [1] are used unchanged in the present analysis.\nThe InDown events are added to the PC muon-flavor sample, and the Ambiguous events\n\n13\n\n\fare used only in the overall normalization. The UpStop events are treated as a new\ncategory and analyzed as a function of log10 L rather than as a function of log10 (L/E).\n(3) A likelihood function for the data is constructed as a function of \u2206m2 , the mass-squared\ndifference, and of sin2 2\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the mixing angle, using probability density functions\n(pdf's) determined from the MC sample. Details of the formalism are given in Ref. [1].\n(4) The summed negative log likelihood is evaluated at each point on a 15 \u00d7 80 grid of\nsin2 2\u03b8 \u00d7 log10 (\u2206m2 ) with sin2 2\u03b8 varied between 0.0 and 1.0 and \u2206m2 varied between\n10\u22125 and 100 eV2 . The lowest negative log likelihood on the grid is found and \u2206L, the\ndifference between the lowest value and the value in each (sin2 2\u03b8, \u2206m2 ) grid square, is\nplotted.\n(5) A background contribution of non-neutrino events arising from neutrons and gammas\nproduced by muon interactions in the rock around the detector is added to the likelihood\nfunction. The background contribution only affects the FC events; the PC events and\nthe new InDown and UpStop events are treated as background-free.\n(6) The overall normalization of the MC and the amounts of background in the different\nFC event samples, estimated using shield-tagged data events and the depth distribution\nof the event vertices, are nuisance parameters whose values are optimized at each grid\nsquare.\n(7) The allowed confidence level regions are calculated by the method of Feldman and\nCousins [17]. That is, MC experiments are generated and analyzed at each grid square to\ncalculate the expected likelihood rise for a given confidence level based on the statistical\nand systematic errors at that grid square. In addition to the systematic errors described\nin Ref. [1], a 10% systematic error on the relative normalization of the UpStop events\nto the remainder of the data was allowed. The latter error represents uncertainties\nin density and nuclear composition of rock below the detector, and uncertainties with\nvariation of neutrino cross sections in rock versus iron.\n(8) The analysis of Ref. [1] used the one-dimensional flux calculation of the Bartol group\n[12]. This analysis uses their new three-dimensional calculation [13] and compares it\nwith their 1D calculation and with the 3D calculation of Battistoni et al. [14].\nThe 44 new data events documented here are added to the 488 data events of the previous\nanalysis. However, the new events are \"high resolution\" \u03bc-flavor events, those most sensitive\nto oscillations, consequently they enhance the sensitivity afforded by the 167 events of that\ntype in the previous analysis.\n7.2\n\nOscillation results\n\nThe values of \u2206L are plotted in Fig. 10 as a function of sin2 2\u03b8 and log10 (\u2206m2 ). The\nresulting surface is similar to that reported in Ref. [1]. The main difference is that the\nlikelihood rise for the grid square with the lowest values of \u2206m2 and sin2 2\u03b8 (called the\nno oscillation point) is 16.0 compared with 11.3 for the previous analysis. The new data\n14\n\n\fFigure 10: The data likelihood difference, \u2206L, plotted as a function of sin2 2\u03b8 and log10 (\u2206m2 ).\n\nhas significantly increased the discrimination against the no-oscillation hypothesis, mostly\nbecause of the large suppression of the UpStop data compared to the MC prediction. The\nprobability of the validity of the no-oscillation hypothesis is discussed in Sect. 7.3.\nThe \u2206L surface in Fig. 10 exhibits two nearly equal minima, one at the grid square\ncentered at \u2206m2 = 0.0017 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8 = 0.97, and one at \u2206m2 = 0.0052 eV2 , sin2 2\u03b8\n= 0.97. The first minimum is the \"best fit point\" of this analysis, while the second minimum\nwas the best fit point in the previous analysis [1]. The difference of \u2206L between the two is\nonly 0.18. There is a small rise in likelihood between the two minima which peaks at about\n1.8 in the region of the Super-K best-fit point. However, the 90%-confidence-level limit of\nthis analysis, determined in Sect. 7.3, contains all of the Super-K allowed region. The value\nof the flux normalization at the best fit point is 91% of the Bartol-3D prediction [13].\nAlthough the analysis is carried out using the log-likelihood function, it is useful to evaluate the goodness of the fit by projecting out the distributions for the various data sets and\ncalculating a \u03c72 for the data compared to the MC prediction. Fig. 11a shows the data for\nthe total muon PC sample (including the InDown events) and Fig. 11b shows the UpStop\nevents, compared to the MC predictions.\nThe PC events are in good agreement with the no-oscillation histogram, but disagree,\nparticularly at low L/E (downward going \u03bd events), with the prediction at the highest\n15\n\n\fFigure 11: (a) The log10 L/E distribution for the PC event sample that includes the InDown events. (b) The\nUpStop events plotted as a function of log10 L. The points with error bars are the data. The solid histogram\nis the MC prediction at the best fit point, and the dashed histogram shows the no-oscillation expectation.\nThe dotted histogram depicts \"saturated oscillations\" with sin2 2\u03b8 = 1.0, \u2206m2 = 1.0 eV2 .\n\nconsidered values of \u2206m2 and sin2 2\u03b8 (\u223c1.0 eV2 and \u223c1.0), where the oscillations have the\ngreatest frequency and largest size (called \"saturated oscillations\"). On the other hand, the\nUpStop events are in disagreement with the no-oscillation prediction, particularly at large L,\nbut agree with the saturated oscillation prediction. This behavior is indicative of oscillations\nwith values of \u2206m2 in the low 10\u22123 eV2 region where downward-going neutrinos have not yet\noscillated and upward-going neutrinos have saturated oscillations. The best-fit prediction\nagrees well with both distributions.\nTable 2 gives the \u03c72 for the comparison of data and MC for the PC and UpStop distributions as well as the full data set including the other distributions described in Ref. [1]. The\n\u03c72 at the best fit point, using all of the data, is 35.6 for 30 data points.\n7.3\n\nConfidence levels\n\nThe 90%-confidence-level surface \u2206L90 (not shown), generated by the MC experiments under\nFeldman-Cousins prescription is very similar to that of the previous analysis. Combining the\n\u2206L90 surface with the data likelihood surface of Fig. 10 gives the solid-line 90%-confidencelevel contour shown in Fig. 12a. For comparison, the 90%-confidence-level contour determined previously in Ref. [1] is shown by the dotted line. It can be seen that the allowed\n16\n\n\fTable 2: The \u03c72 for comparisons of the data to various MC predictions for the PC events, the UpStop events,\nand the full data set.\n\nBest fit\nNo oscillations\nSaturated oscillations\n\n\u03c72 /Number of data points\nPC\nUpStop All data\n5.0/5\n0.6/4\n35.6/30\n5.9/5\n7.9/4\n66.6/30\n19.8/5 1.9/4\n63.2/30\n\nFigure 12: (a) The 90% confidence allowed region from the Feldman-Cousins analysis of this work (solid\nline), compared to that of Ref. [1] [1] (dotted line).

This is due to the fact that the likelihood surface is rather flat\nat the base of the valley and small changes in the data can move the contours substantially\nin this region.\nFig.12b shows the 68%, 90% and 95% contours, a further indication of the shape of the\nlikelihood surface. Also displayed in Fig.12b is the 90% sensitivity contour obtained from the\nMonte Carlo experiments, which denotes the expected 90% contour for experiments with this\nstatistical precision and systematic errors. As was the case in Ref. [1], the 90%-CL contour\nfrom this analysis is more restrictive than the estimated sensitivity contour, due, in part, to\na small mismatch of the overall event-rate normalization in the electron and muon samples.\nThe probability of no oscillations can be calculated, under the Feldman-Cousins prescription and including all of the systematic effects, by generating experiments at the minimum\n\u2206m2 and sin2 2\u03b8 grid square and counting those MC experiments that give a larger likelihood\ndifference than 16.0. In 500,000 simulated experiments, 16 had a larger likelihood difference\ngiving a probability of 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 for the no-oscillation hypothesis.\nFor UpStop muons and upward-going contained vertex events, the initiating neutrino\nmay experience Mikheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance and other matter effects\nas a result of the traversal of thousands of kilometers of terrestrial matter. The magnitude\nof matter-induced deviations from vacuum oscillations was studied using simulated event\nsamples; the samples were weighted in accordance with three-neutrino mixing and the normal mass hierarchy, using the approximation of a uniform (path-weighted mean) terrestrial\ndensity [19]. For the range of plausible \u2206m2 values, it was found that matter effects, even\nwith maximally allowed mixing angles, can only introduce a few percent additional depletion\nof muon-flavor neutrinos beyond that which results from \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 vacuum oscillations [20].\nSince the scale of such deviations is well below the statistical sensitivity afforded by the data,\nmatter effects were neglected in this analysis.\n7.4\n\nFlux model comparison and event rate normalization\n\nThe analysis of this data has been carried out for three different atmospheric neutrino flux\ncalculations: (i) the one-dimensional flux calculation of the Bartol group [12], (ii) the Bartol\nthree-dimensional calculation [13], and (iii) the three-dimensional calculation of Battistoni\net al. [14]. As well as the flux prediction, the analysis requires an estimate of the height\nin the atmosphere at which the neutrino is produced. This is particularly important for\nneutrinos coming from overhead where the path in the atmosphere is a large fraction of\nthe total path length. A parameterization of the pion and muon decay heights was made\nusing the formalism of Ref. [18] for the one-dimensional Bartol calculation. A similar\nparameterization for decay heights was prepared for the three-dimensional Bartol case. The\nlatter parameterization was also used for predictions based upon the Battistoni et al. flux.\nFig. 13 shows the 90%-CL region for the three cases. There is a small change from the\none- to three-dimensional flux models, however the three-dimensional models of Bartol and\nBattistoni et al. give almost identical results. The only significant difference between the\nthree cases is in the absolute normalization of the flux. At the best-fit point of this analysis,\nthe normalization factor (number of events observed/calculated) for the Bartol 1D flux is\n18\n\n\fFigure 13: The 90%-confidence-level allowed region for three atmospheric-neutrino flux calculations. The\ndotted curve is based upon the 1D-model of the Bartol group from 1996 [12]. The more recent 3D calculations\nof Battistoni et al. [14] and of the Bartol group [13] lead to the dashed and solid curve, respectively.\n\n0.86, while for the Bartol 3D flux the factor is 0.91 and for the Battistoni et al. flux it is\n1.02.\nThe authors of the flux calculations typically quote large errors of \u00b120% on the absolute\nnormalization, due to the uncertainties on the incoming cosmic-ray fluxes and on nucleus-air\ncross sections. There are also significant errors on the neutrino cross sections. It is thus of\ninterest to determine the experimental error on the ratio of the measured to the predicted\nevent rate. The experimental event rate is proportional to the incident neutrino flux, the\nneutrino cross sections in the detector, and the detector acceptance. This experiment can\nthus determine the normalization of the atmospheric neutrino flux at the Soudan-2 site times\nthe neutrino cross sections encoded in the NEUGEN3 program [15], for an iron calorimeter\nwith a given energy threshold. Translation of this normalization factor to other experiments\nat the Soudan site and at other sites is possible in principle. However it requires knowledge\nof the relative neutrino fluxes at the different sites and the ratio of the neutrino cross sections\nif a different detector medium or a different neutrino generator is used.\nThe event-rate normalization factor for Soudan 2 is subject to the following errors:\n(1) The total number of neutrino events observed in this experiment above an energy threshold of 300 MeV, obtained from Table I of Ref. [1] and Table 2 of this paper, is 481.2\u00b126.2\n(\u00b15.4%). The error includes the statistical error and the error on the background subtraction.\n(2) The statistical error on the Monte Carlo sample is \u00b11.6%.\n(3) The variation of the fitted normalization factor over the 68% confidence region of the\noscillation parameters is \u00b13%. The Feldman-Cousins analysis includes the systematic\n19\n\n\ferrors associated with the background subtraction, cross section uncertainties and energy scale uncertainties.\n(4) Depending on the value of \u03b823 , \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc oscillations with the solar parameters could\nchange the flux of \u03bde that have traversed the Earth [21, 22]. The change can be positive\nor negative depending on whether \u03b823 is smaller or greater than 45o . Using the SuperK limits for sin2 2\u03b823 and recent values for the solar oscillation parameters [7, 23], an\nuncertainty of \u00b13.3% in the calculated electron-event rate is estimated.\n(5) Uncertainty arises in the rate of multi-GeV muon events due to matter effects [20]. A\n\u00b11.6% error contribution to the event rate calculation is inferred.\n(6) Any mismatch between the Monte Carlo representation of the detector and reality\ncould introduce a relative error in the acceptance of the two and thus an error in the\nnormalization ratio. Detailed studies of individual event channels revealed no significant\ndifferences [24, 25]. The relative proportions of different event types and event rejection\nmodes in data versus Monte Carlo samples were studied. A \u00b12% systematic error,\nestimated from the maximum differences found between the data and Monte Carlo, has\nbeen assigned to account for uncertainties arising from geometric acceptance and other\nresidual effects.\nBased upon the \u00b18% quadrature sum of these errors, an overall normalization factor of\n0.91\u00b10.07 is determined for this analysis. This normalization is specific to the Soudan 2\nsite, the detector medium, the Bartol 3D flux, and to the neutrino cross sections encoded in\nthe NEUGEN3 event generator. It is averaged over the years 1989-2001, one full solar cycle.\nThe same percentage error, \u00b18%, is applicable to the Soudan-2 normalization factors given\nabove for the Bartol 1D and Battistoni et al. 3D atmospheric fluxes.\nAs a check, a normalization which is mostly independent of the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 oscillation parameters can be obtained from the total electron sample of contained and partially contained\nevents.

[1] lists 208.7\u00b115.9 background-subtracted electron-neutrino events\nto be compared with an expected rate from the 3D Bartol prediction of 238.1 events, yielding\na normalization factor of 0.88\u00b10.07, where the error is just statistical from the number of\nevents and does not include the contribution from \u03bde \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc oscillations or the other error\nsources detailed above.\n\n8\n\nConclusions\n\nSamples of upward stopping muons produced by neutrino interactions in the rock below\nthe Soudan-2 detector and partially-contained events with downward-going muons produced\nin the detector have been separately isolated. These two new data sets provide additional\nsupport and constraints for the hypothesis of atmospheric-neutrino oscillations. The flux of\nupward stopping neutrino-induced muon events is observed to be suppressed by a factor of\napproximately two, while downward-going muon events are not suppressed. An oscillation\nanalysis using the method described in Ref. [1] and adding this new data gives a more\nrestrictive 90%-confidence-level allowed region of \u2206m2 and sin2 2\u03b8 . The probability of the\nno-oscillation hypothesis is reduced by more than a factor of 10, to 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n20\n\n\fFigure 14: The Soudan 2 90% confidence allowed region in sin2 2\u03b8, \u2206m2 (solid line) compared with the\nallowed regions of MACRO (dot-and-dashed line) [27], and of the Super-K zenith angle [7] (dotted line) and\nL/E [26] (dashed line) analyses.\n\nThe data have been analyzed using three models of the atmospheric flux at the northern\ngeomagnetic latitude of this experiment. The models include two recent three-dimensional\nflux calculations and an older one-dimensional calculation. The oscillation parameters are\nfound to be essentially independent of the flux calculation. The normalization factor for\nthe experiment, 0.91\u00b10.07, is the measured event rate divided by the calculated event rate\nwhere the latter is the convolution of neutrino fluxes of the Bartol 3D flux calculation with\nneutrino cross sections encoded in NEUGEN3. The denominator for this ratio contains\nelements which are specific to the Soudan-2 detector analysis, and site. Consequently, the\nnormalization factor cannot be compared in a straightforward way to other experiments\nat other geomagnetic latitudes with different detector media and using different neutrino\ninteraction generators.\nComparison of this experiment's revised 90% CL allowed region with the most recent\nSuper-K [7, 26] and MACRO [27] allowed regions is shown in Fig. 14. This result is in good\nagreement with both experiments.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.K. Particle Physics and\nAstronomy Research Council, and the State and University of Minnesota.
