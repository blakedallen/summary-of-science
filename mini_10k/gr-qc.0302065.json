However, most texts on general relativity1 do not contain a\nsufficient number of solvable examples that illustrate the behavior of geodesics in a nontrivial\ngeometry. This lack is largely due to the fact that the geodesic equations as well as the\ngeodesic deviation equations are not easy to solve exactly in most of the standard geometries\nof interest. A traditional example is the case of the line element on the surface of a twodimensional sphere for which the geodesic and the geodesic deviation equations can be\nsolved analytically. Some other exactly solvable examples in two dimensions include Rindler\nspacetime, the line element on a cylinder and the hyperbolic plane.\nIn this article, we will discuss a two-dimensional example (with a diagonal line element\nof Lorentzian signature (\u2212+), i.e. of the form ds2 = g00 dt2 + g11 dx2 , with g00 everywhere\nnegative and g11 , positive) , for which, like the sphere, there are exact solutions for geodesics\nas well as geodesic deviation. The line element for this example arises in the context of the\nstringy black holes.2 In fact, this is the geometry of the first stringy black hole discovered in\nthe early nineties by Mandal et al.4 We will not go into the details of how this line element\nis obtained. Interested readers may read the original references4 to enlighten themselves on\nthis aspect. For our purposes here, the line element represents a geometry that is given to\nus, and we see that there are exact solutions for geodesics and geodesic deviation for test\nparticles moving in this geometry.\n\nII.\n\nTHE LINE ELEMENT\n\nWe begin by writing down the line element of interest4 :\nkdr 2\nM\u0001 2\n\u0001.\ndt + 2\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212\nr\n4r 1 \u2212 Mr\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere M is equivalent to GM/c2 with the choice of units G = 1 and c = 1. Similarly k is\nrequired to have dimensions of length squared in order to render the metric coefficient grr\ndimensionless.\nThe domain for the radial coordinate is r > M and t is allowed to vary from \u2212\u221e < t < \u221e.\nThe physical meaning of the constants M and k can be explained in the context of twodimensional string theory. For completeness (and also with the risk of introducing some\n2\n\n\funexplained jargon), we mention that M is related to mass and k to the central charge\nparameter.\nSeveral purely geometrical facts about this line element are worth noting. At r = M,\ngtt \u2192 0 and grr \u2192 \u221e. If r < M, the signs of gtt and grr are interchanged. Readers familiar\nwith some general relativity (say, the Schwarzschild solution) would call r = M the horizon\nand thereby, characterize the line element as a black hole provided there exists a singularity\n(which is the case here, as we shall see later) inside the horizon (that is, in the region r < M).\nAs the title of this article suggests, the geometry represents a two-dimensional black hole. As\nis common knowledge, a black hole is a region from where nothing can escape. If an object\nfalls into a black hole (that is, the object crosses the horizon), the object ends up getting\nstretched and torn apart by the gravitational forces within. This distortion is quantified\nthrough the deviation of geodesics. The ultimate fate is collapse into a singularity where\nthe matter density is infinitely large, thereby being a region of extreme curvature. We shall\nconcern ourselves with the r > M region.\nThe pathology in the line element (that is, grr \u2192 \u221e ) at r = M is entirely a coordinate\nartifact (a poor choice of coordinates). In addition, it is worth noting, that unlike the case for\nsimilar but four-dimensional line elements where the horizon is a sphere or some other twodimensional surface, here it is a point and falling into a black hole is manifest in crossing this\npoint and entering the region of no return. The spacetime here is undoubtedly very similar to\nthe two-dimensional r\u2013t section of the static, spherically symmetric four-dimensional black\nholes (like the Schwarzschild metric). Many of the features of black holes can be understood\nvia this example. In fact an extensive research literature exists on two-dimensional black\nholes where interesting phenomena such as Hawking radiation and information loss have\nbeen discussed (see Ref. 2 and references therein and Ref. 3).\nThe line element in Eq. (1) also can be written in the following form3 :\nds2 = \u2212 tanh2\n\nMx \u0001 2\n\u221a dt + dx2 ,\n2 k\n\nwhere we have used the coordinate transformation x =\n\n\u221a\n\nk\nM\n\n(2)\n\n2r\ncosh\u22121 ( M\n\u2212 1) > 0. Notice that\n\nthe singular nature of the metric function g11 at r = M is no longer there in this form of\nthe line element. A third form of the line element is the Kruskal extension or the maximal\nanalytical extension done exactly in the same way as for the Schwarzschild metric. (For\ndetails on how to construct Kruskal coordinates see any standard text on general relativity.)\n3\n\n\fIf we introduce the coordinates u and v defined by:\n\u221a\nk\nu =t\u2212\nln |r \u2212 M|\n\u221a2\nk\nln |r \u2212 M|,\nv =t+\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nand U = \u2212 k exp(\u2212u/ k), V = k exp(v/ k), we can rewrite the line element as:\nds2 = \u2212\n\ndUdV\n.\n\u2212 UkV\n\nM\n\u221a\nk\n\n(3a)\n(3b)\n\n(4)\n\nIn Eq. (3) the coordinates u and v run from \u2212\u221e to \u221e and \u2212\u221e < U < 0, 0 < V < \u221e. It\nis possible to further rewrite the line element using coordinates 2T = V + U, 2X = V \u2212 U.\nThe Kruskal form of the line element is an 'extension' over the whole domain of r and t The\ngeometry of this Kruskal extension has features similar to that of the Schwarzschild.\n\nIII.\n\nTIMELIKE GEODESICS\n\nOur main goal is to find timelike geodesics (that is, trajectories of test particles of nonzero\nrest mass) in the line element given in Eq. (1). The equations and constraint for timelike\ngeodesics are given as:\n\u1e8d\u03bc + \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb \u1e8b\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bb = 0\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = \u22121,\n\n(5a)\n(5b)\n\nwhere x\u03bc are the coordinates (here r and t), and \u03bc takes on values 0 and 1 for t and r\nrespectively. Equation (5b) is the timelike constraint on the trajectories\nThe differentiation (indicated by dots) in Eq. (5) is with respect to the affine parameter\n(proper time) \u03bb. The Christofel symbol \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb is given as:\n1\n\u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb = g \u03bc\u03c1 [g\u03c1\u03bd,\u03bb + g\u03c1\u03bb,\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bd\u03bb,\u03c1],\n2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere a comma denotes ordinary differentiation with respect to coordinate x\u03bc .The nonzero\ncomponents of \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb for the line element in Eq. (1) are\nM\n2r(r \u2212 M)\n2M(r \u2212 M)\n=\nkr\n(2r \u2212 M)\n= \u2212\n2r(r \u2212 M)\n\n\u0393010 = \u0393001 =\n\n(7a)\n\n\u0393100\n\n(7b)\n\n\u0393111\n\n4\n\n(7c)\n\n\fThe reader might ask why aren't we interested in null geodesics (that is, trajectories of\ntest particles having zero rest mass, such as light rays) ? In two dimensions null geodesics are\nthe same as those for the flat Minkowski line element. Note that any two-dimensional line element (with Euclidean or Lorentzian signature) can be written as ds2 = \u03a92 (x, t)[\u2212dt2 +dx2 ],\nwhere \u03a92 (x, t) is a nonzero, positive definite function of x and t and is called the conformal\nfactor. Null geodesics require that g\u03bc\u03bd \u1e8b\u03bc \u1e8b\u03bd = 0, which implies that in two dimensions, null\ngeodesics for Minkowski spacetime are the same as those for any other nontrivially curved\nspacetime.\nThe timelike constraint in Eq. (5) for the line element of interest here (Eq. (1)), is given\nas:\n\u2212 1\u2212\n\nM\u0001 2\nk\n\u1e6b + 2\nr\n4r 1 \u2212\n\nM\nr\n\nThe geodesic equations (one each for r and t) are\n\u1e6b =\n\nr\u0308 \u2212\n\nE\n2 1\u2212\n\nM\nr\n\n\u0001 \u1e59 2 = \u22121.\n\n\u0001\n\nE 2 Mr\n1 \u0002 2r \u2212 M \u0003 2\n\u1e59\n+\n= 0,\n2 r 2 \u2212 Mr\n2k(r \u2212 M)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere in Eq. (9) we have substituted for \u1e6b from Eq. (9). E in the above is a constant of the\nmotion and arises due to the absence of the coordinate t in the metric coefficients. If we\nsubstitute \u1e6b from Eq. (9) in the timelike constraint in Eq. (8). we obtain\n\u1e59 2 =\n\n1\n[(E 2 \u2212 4)r 2 + 4Mr] = \u2212V (r) + E0 ,\nk\n\n(11)\n\nwhere E0 is a constant and V (r) is like an effective potential given by:\n1\nV (r) = E0 \u2212 [(E 2 \u2212 4)r 2 + 4Mr].\nk\n\n(12)\n\nNotice that the effective potential is like that of the harmonic oscillator for E 2 < 4 and\nlike that of an inverted harmonic oscillator for E 2 > 4. For E 2 = 4 it is linear with a\nnegative slope. We can make a coordinate change (translation) in order to see the harmonic\noscillator/inverted harmonic oscillator forms explicitly. The potentials for the three cases\nare shown in Fig. 1.\nIf we substitute \u1e59 and its derivative with respect to \u03bb from the timelike constraint (11)\nin Eq. (10) for r, the equation is satisfied identically. Therefore, it is enough to just obtain\n5\n\n\fr(\u03bb) by integrating the timelike constraint for the three cases (E 2 < 4, E 2 = 4, E 2 > 4) and\nobtain r(\u03bb) and subsequently t(\u03bb). These results are given below.\nCase 1: E 2 < 4.\nr(\u03bb) =\n\nB\n(1 + cos a\u03bb)\n2A\n\n(13a)\n\nE\u0002\n1\nq + tan c\u03bb \u0003\n\u03bb+\n,\n(13b)\nln\n2\nqa q \u2212 tan c\u03bb\np\nwhere q 2 = (1 + f )/(1 \u2212 f ), A = 4 \u2212 E 2 , a = A/k, c = a/2, f = 1 \u2212 A/2, and B = 4M.\nt(\u03bb) =\n\nCase 2: E 2 = 4.\n\nr(\u03bb) =\n\nt(\u03bb) = \u03bb +\n\nr\n\nCase 3: E 2 > 4.\nr(\u03bb) =\n\nM 2\n\u03bb\nk\n\n\u221a\nk\n\u03bb \u2212 k\u0001\n\u221a .\nln\n4\n\u03bb+ k\n\nB\n(\u22121 + cosh a\u03bb)\n2A\n\n(14a)\n\n(14b)\n\n(15a)\n\nE\u0002\nq tanh c\u03bb \u2212 q \u0003\n\u03bb + ln\n,\n(15b)\n2\na tanh c\u03bb + q\np\nwhere q 2 = (f \u2212 1)/(f + 1), A = E 2 \u2212 4, a = A/k, c = a/2, f = 1 + A/2, and B = 4M.\nt(\u03bb) =\n\nIn each case, the functional form of r(t) can be obtained by utilizing the parametric forms\n\nr(\u03bb), t(\u03bb). Figures 2\u20134 illustrate the above function. The origin of the coordinates in each\nof these figures is chosen to be r = 1 and t = 0. In particular, Fig. 4 shows the actual radial\ntrajectory r(t) as a function of time. It is not possible to write r as an explicit function of\nt because of the nature of the functional dependence of t on \u03bb. However, we may write t(r)\nby inverting r(\u03bb) to \u03bb(r) and then using this function in t(\u03bb(r)). Notice that for E 2 < 4,\nthe trajectory hovers around the horizon (extending only up to r = 2M = 2), reaching the\nvalue r = M = 1 only asymptotically. However, for E 2 \u2265 4 there is no such restriction and\nthe trajectory can extend from M to \u221e.\nIt should be mentioned that the \"discontinuities\" in some of the plots arise because of\nthe choice of the parameter (M = 1 implies that r > 1) and, consequently, the allowed\ndomain of the independent variable. They are not real discontinuities of the functions, as is\napparent from the solutions.\n\n6\n\n\fIV.\n\nGEODESIC DEVIATION\n\nWe now consider the geodesic deviation equation in order to analyze the behavior of\nthe spreading of the geodesic curves obtained in Sec. III. Before we discuss the geodesic\ndeviation in the black hole line element, we briefly recall some of the basic notions of geodesic\ndeviation.5\nIn a curved spacetime geodesics are not the straight lines of our Euclidean intuition.\nFor instance, the geodesics on the surface of a sphere are the great circles. To understand\nhow geodesics are spread out in a spacetime of nontrivial curvature, we consider a bundle\nof geodesics around a specific geodesic (called the central geodesic). At every point on\nthis central geodesic we erect little normals. This normal is the connecting vector, so-called\nbecause as we move along the connecting vector. we reach neighboring geodesics. The reader\nmight ask why normal deformations only? The answer is that tangential deformations are\ntaken into account through the reparametrisation of the affine parameter \u03bb, or, in other\nwords, they do not deform the trajectory to a neighboring one.\nIt is obvious that the nature of the connecting vector (or deviation vector) in a nontrivial\nspacetime depends crucially on the properties of the spacetime, or more importantly, as it\nturns out, on its curvature properties. For instance, on the surface of a sphere, if we look at\ntwo neighboring great circle arcs connecting the north and south poles, the distance between\nthem increases, reaches a certain value at the equator, and then decreases untill it reaches\na zero value at the other pole. The deviation vector essentially measures this effect, which\n\u03bc\nis dictated by the properties of the Riemann tensor R\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\ngiven by:\n\u03bc\nR\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\n= \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1,\u03bb \u2212 \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb,\u03c1 + \u0393\u03bc\u03c3\u03bb \u0393\u03c3\u03bd\u03c1 \u2212 \u0393\u03bc\u03c3\u03c1 \u0393\u03c3\u03bd\u03bb .\n\n(16)\n\nThe Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar are obtained from the above Riemann tensor by\n\u03bb\nappropriate contractions with the metric tensor (Ricci tensor, R\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd\nand Ricci scalar,\n\nR = g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd ).\nWe know from Einstein's general relativity that geometry is equivalent to the presence\nof a gravitational field. Thus the deviation of trajectories from each other is a measure of\nthe relative gravitational force between the objects moving on these separate, neighboring,\ntrajectories. We now state the geodesic deviation equation and solve it for the geodesics in\nthe black hole line element, Eq. (1), discussed here.\n7\n\n\fGiven a geodesic curve, we identify the tangent and normal to it as the vectors e\u03bc and\nn\u03bc respectively. These satisfy the orthonormality conditions:\ng\u03bc\u03bd e\u03bc e\u03bd = \u22121\n\n(17a)\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc n\u03bd = 1\n\n(17b)\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd e\u03bc n\u03bd = 0.\n\n(17c)\n\nWe make the assumptions:\ne\u03bc \u2261 (\u1e6b, \u1e59)\n\n(18a)\n\nn\u03bc \u2261 (f (r)\u1e59, g(r)\u1e6b).\n\n(18b)\n\nNote that other choices can be made and thus the above definitions in Eq. (18) are by\nno means unique. If we substitute the assumptions in Eq. (18) into the orthonormality\nconditions Eq. (17), we obtain the following relations for f (r) and g(r):\nr\ng11\nf (r) =\n\u2212g00\nr\n\u2212g00\n.\ng(r) =\ng11\nTherefore the normal vector n\u03bc takes the form:\n\u221a\nn0 =\n\nn1 =\n\nk\n2r(1 \u2212\n2r(1 \u2212\n\u221a\nk\n\nM\n)\nr\nM\n)\nr\n\n(19a)\n(19b)\n\n\u1e59\n\n(20a)\n\n\u1e6b.\n\n(20b)\n\nThe equation for the normal deformations \u03b7 (where \u03b7 \u03bc = \u03b7n\u03bc , \u03b7 \u03bc being the deviation vector)\nis given by:\nd2 \u03b7\n+ R\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 e\u03bc n\u03bd e\u03c1 n\u03c3 \u03b7 = 0.\nd\u03bb2\n\n(21)\n\nThe nonzero components of Riemann tensor in the coordinate frame are given by:\nM\n2r 3\nM\n= 3.\n2r\n\nR0101 = R1010 = \u2212\n\n(22a)\n\nR0110 = R1001\n\n(22b)\n\nThere is actually only one independent component of the Riemann tensor in two dimensions (recall that in n dimensions, the number of independent components is n2 (n2 \u2212 1)/12).\n8\n\n\f\u03b1\nThe nonzero Ricci tensor components in the coordinate frame (R\u03bc\u03bd = R\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\n) and the Ricci\n\nscalar (R = g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd ) are\n2M(r \u2212 M)\nkr 2\nM\nR11 =\n2\n2r (r \u2212 M)\n4M\nR =\nkr\nR00 = \u2212\n\n(23a)\n(23b)\n(23c)\n\nThe Riemann tensor components and Ricci scalar diverge as r \u2192 0. The geometry\nbecomes singular as r \u2192 0. However, r \u2192 M does not seem to be a preferred point (in\ncomparison to r = 0 say), a fact that re-emphasizes the point that the pathology at r = M\nin the line element in Eq. (1) is largely a coordinate artifact. Of course, the special nature\nof r = M is that it is a horizon with the metric signature changing sign as we move from\nr > M to r < M.\nIf we substitute the Riemann tensor components for the two-dimensional black hole line\nelement and use the normal and tangent mentioned in Eq. 18 , we find that the deviation\nequation reduces to the following equations for the three cases discussed earlier.\nCase 1: E 2 < 4.\nd2 \u03b7\n\u2212 2 sec2 \u03bb\u0304\u03b7 = 0,\nd\u03bb\u03042\nwhere \u03bb\u0304 =\n\n1\n2\n\nq\n\n4\u2212E 2\n\u03bb.\nk\n\n(24)\n\nThe two linearly independent solutions to Eq. (24) are\n\u03b7(\u03bb\u0304) = C1 tan \u03bb\u0304 + C2 (\u03bb\u0304 tan \u03bb\u0304 + 1).\n\n(25)\n\nd2 \u03b7\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b7 = 0.\nd\u03bb2 \u03bb2\n\n(26)\n\nCase 2: E 2 = 4.\n\nThe solutions are\n\u03b7(\u03bb) = C1 \u03bb2 + C2\n\n1\n\u03bb\n\n(27)\n\nCase 3: E 2 > 4.\nd2 \u03b7\n\u2212 2cosech2 \u03bb\u0304\u03b7 = 0,\n2\nd\u03bb\u0304\nwhere \u03bb\u0304 =\n\n1\n2\n\nq\n\nE 2 \u22124\n\u03bb.\nk\n\n(28)\n\nIn this case, the solutions are\n\u03b7(\u03bb\u0304) = C1 coth \u03bb\u0304 + C2 (\u03bb\u0304 coth \u03bb\u0304 \u2212 1)\n9\n\n(29)\n\n\fIn Eqs. (25), (27), and (29), C1 and C2 are separate arbitrary constants in each case. These\nconstants should be determined by the initial conditions (that is, the value of the initial\nseparation between a pair of geodesics at a specific value of the affine parameter and the\nvalue of the rate of change of the initial separation at the same value of \u03bb, similar to the\nconditions for obtaining particular solutions of second-order, linear, ordinary differential\nequations).\nNow that we have obtained \u03b7 for each case, it is easy to write down the deviation vectors,\nwhich are given by \u03b7 \u03bc = \u03b7n\u03bc (where \u03bc = 0, 1). Let us now discuss a representative case, say\nE 2 = 4. The range of \u03bb (for r > M = 1) is between \u2212\u221e < \u03bb < \u22121 and 1 < \u03bb < \u221e. If we\nconsider a pair of neighboring geodesics at say \u03bb = 1.5 and assume \u03b7\u0307 is positive, then we are\nforced to choose the solution for \u03b7 to be proportional to \u03bb2 . The evolution of \u03b7 then suggests\nthat as we move further and further to larger positive \u03bb, the geodesics spread out (diverge).\nOn the other hand, if we assume \u03b7\u0307 to be negative, then we must choose the\n\n1\n\u03bb\n\nsolution,\n\nwhich says that for larger \u03bb (which corresponds to larger r as well), the geodesics converge,\nat least locally. However, as we go to larger \u03bb, \u03b7\u0307 also becomes smaller and approaches zero\nas \u03bb \u2192 \u221e (r \u2192 \u221e). Therefore, ultimately the geodesics become parallel to each other.\n\nIt is also useful to note that d2 \u03b7/d\u03bb2, the measure of the gravitational force, is like a\n\nrelative force which acts to change the separation between a pair of neighboring geodesics.\nWe can easily substitute the values of \u03bb (or \u03bb\u0304) from the expressions of r(\u03bb) in the geodesic\ndeviation equations (24), (26), and (28) to analyze the nature of the force. As an example,\nlet us consider the case E 2 = 4. For \u03b7 = \u03bb2 , the relative force is constant throughout and is\ngiven by:\nd2 \u03b7\n= 2,\nd\u03bb2\n\n(30)\n\n\u0012 \u00133/2\nM\nd2 \u03b7\n.\n=2\n2\nd\u03bb\nkr\n\n(31)\n\nwhereas for \u03b7 = 1/\u03bb, we have\n\nEquation (31) tells us that the force vanishes as r goes to infinity (recall that the geometry\nis flat in this limit and the geodesics will become parallel to each other), whereas for r \u2192 M,\n\nit has the value 2/k 3/2 . A similar analysis can be carried out for the cases with E 2 < 4 and\nE 2 > 4.\nA point worth mentioning here (without proof) is that in the above geometry, the\ngeodesics do not seem to converge to a point within a finite value of \u03bb in any of the cases\n10\n\n\fbecause of the fact that the Ricci scalar is non-negative (it is zero only when r \u2192 \u221e). In\ntwo dimensions, timelike geodesics do not converge to a point (focus) within a finite value\nof the affine parameter unless R \u2264 0.6\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn summary, the exact solutions of the geodesic deviation equation can provide us with a\nbetter understanding of the nature of the separation between geodesics. Readers can further\ninvestigate the deviation vectors in the cases not discussed above in order to improve their\nunderstanding of geodesic deviation. Trajectories in two dimensions are of the form r(t).\nThe nontrivial curvature of the spacetime is responsible for their difference from the usual\n'straight lines' in Minkowski spacetime\u2013the solutions to the geodesic equation obtained in\nthe above line element provide examples. If we take pairs of trajectories it is obvious that\nthey may converge towards or diverge away from each other\u2013a measure of this effect is\ngeodesic deviation. We have illustrated this effect in our example above.\nOur aim has been to provide an example where the geodesic and geodesic deviation\nequations can be exactly solved. It has been shown that for the line element of a twodimensional black hole, exact, reasonably simple solutions do exist. We hope that the\nrelevance of the line element, as well as the simplicity of the solutions will attract students\nand teachers to use this example when teaching a first course in general relativity. We\nalso mention that, as far as we know, the exact solutions to the geodesic and the geodesic\ndeviation equations do not exist in the literature and might be of some interest to researchers\nas well. There are innumerable solutions representing black holes and cosmologies in twodimensional gravity, most of which have appeared largely in the last decade and a half.\nWe believe that a carefully chosen section of these line elements can be used as worthwhile\nteaching tools in a first course on general relativity.\n\n11\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nSP thanks the Centre for Theoretical Studies, IIT Kharagpur, India for a visit during\nwhich this work was done.

In a nutshell, convergence of timelike geodesics (that is,\nfocusing) within a finite value of the affine parameter occurs only when the timelike convergence\ncondition R\u03bc\u03bd \u03be \u03bc \u03be \u03bd \u2265 0 is obeyed.
