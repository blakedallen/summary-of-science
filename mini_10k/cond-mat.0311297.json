The reciprocal influence of the spin and lattice degrees of freedom can be due to the spin-orbit interaction (SOI)\nor the orbital ordering effects [1]. Both mechanisms can be responsible\nfor the non-collinear magnetic arrangement through the antisymmetric\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction [2] or through strong dependence of the interatomic exchange on the orbital ordering [1] resulting in\npronounced non-Heisenberg behavior [3]. We consider the first possibil16\nity for several orthorhombically distorted perovskites with D2h\nstructure\nwhere the non-collinear magnetism is allowed by symmetry [4]. However,\nthe magnitude of the effect itself depends on the relative strength of several\nmagnetic interactions.\nWe use the LMTO Green's function technique in the real space and\nperturbative approach both for small deviations of the spin magnetization\nnear the scalar-relativistic equilibrium and SOI. Then, the total energy\nchange can be expressed analytically as \u03b4E = EH +EDM +EM AE . The first\nP\nterm EH \u2243 \u22121/2 ij Jij ei ej (ei is the direction of the spin magnetization\nat the site i ) describes the isotropic Heisenberg exchange interaction and\nappears in the second order with respect to nonuniform rotations of spins\n[5]. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) firstly appears in\nthe second order with respect to the SOI. The antisymmetric coupling\nP\nEDM \u2243 i>j dij [ei \u00d7 ej ] corresponds to the mixed type perturbation with\nrespect to spin rotations and SOI [6].\nJij and dij parameters for LaMO3 series with M=Cr-Fe and SrRuO3\nare shown in Tables 1 and 2. General tendencies of the nearest neighbor\ninteractions Jij can be understood by using simple tight-binding arguments\ngiven in [7]. (i) Jij < 0 at the half of the band filling: t2g -type exchange\ninteraction in LaCrO3 (formal atomic configuration of Cr is t32g e0g ), both\nt2g and eg interactions in LaFeO3 (t32g e2g ). (ii) Jij > 0 at the beginning\nand at the end of the band filling: eg exchange interaction dominating in\nLaMnO3 (t32g e1g ) [6]. (iii) Jij \u223c 0 around 1/3 and 2/3 of the band filling:\nSrRuO3 case (t42g e0g ). On the other hand, dij parameters being proportional\nto the SOI are generally larger in SrRuO3 . The structural factor defined\nby rotations of the MO6 octahedra relative to each other is of the same\n\n\forder of magnitude for all compounds considered here. Thus, for LaMO3\ncompounds the Heisenberg exchange interaction is clearly the strongest,\nwhereas for SrRuO3 it is considerably smaller and comparable with the\nantisymmetric exchange.\nIt is particularly interesting in LaMnO3 that the interlayer exchange\nP\ncoupling J1B = j \u2208B J1j with j running over Mn atoms in the plane B\nin Fig.1 crucially depends on the Jahn-Teller distortion (JTD) and varies\nbetween ferro- (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) [6]. For the pure compound, the AFM interlayer coupling stabilized by JTD is large enough\n(J1B \u2243 \u22121.4mRy [6]) to overcome the antisymmetric interactions and the\nmagnetic spin structure is nearly collinear. Weak FM canting due to the\nd12 interaction and estimated as sin\u22121 |\u03b1c /J1B | is less than 2\u25e6 (see [6] for\ndetails). However, JTD is suppressed rapidly with the hole doping, directly\naffecting the interlayer coupling constant J1B . At certain concentration of\nthe holes one expects |J1B | \u223c |\u03b1c | and large non-collinearity. This tendency qualitatively explains the appearance of the spin-canted AFM phase\naccompanying the AFM-to-FM transition in the low-doped manganites [8].\nIn conclusion, the non-collinear spin structure, imposed by general symmetry rules, is suppressed in LaMO3 oxides by the strong isotropic exchange interaction. The latter is reduced in SrRuO3 suggesting essentially\nnon-collinear magnetic arrangement.\nThe work is partly supported by New Energy and Industrial Technology\nDevelopment Organization (NEDO).\n\n\fReferences\n[1] K.I.Kugel and D.I.Khomskii, Sov.
