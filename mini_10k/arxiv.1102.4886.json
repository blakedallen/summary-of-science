Our results address a recent\nexperimental observation of signatures of magnetic ordering in chiral graphene nanoribbons and\nprovide an avenue towards tuning their properties via the structural and environmental degrees of\nfreedom.\nPACS numbers: 73.22.Pr, 73.20.-r, 75.75.-c\n\nGraphene and derived nanostructures exhibit a large\nnumber of novel electronic properties [1, 2]. One of such\nfeatures is the presence of electronic states localized at\nthe edges of this two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterial [3].\nThese zero-energy edge states were predicted to give rise\nto a novel type of magnetic ordering [4] which may lead\nto practical carbon-based magnetic materials [5]. Even\nmore appealing is the prospective of realizing the theoretical proposals of novel spintronic devices based on\ngraphene [6\u201310]. While evidence for edge states has\nbeen seen experimentally [11, 12], no solid proof of lowdimensional edge magnetism in graphene was presented\nuntil now.\nA recent scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy\nstudy of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with ultrasmooth\nedges showed the presence of edge states with characteristic splitting in the dI/dV spectra \u2013 an unambiguous indication of magnetic ordering [13]. These GNRs produced\nby the chemical unzipping of carbon nanotubes [14] are\nchiral, i.e. characterized by low-symmetry orientation of\nthe edges rather than by high-symmetry zigzag and armchair directions. While the presence of edge states at the\nchiral graphene edges is broadly recognized [3, 15, 16],\ntheoretical investigations of magnetic ordering driven by\nelectron-electron (e\u2013e) interactions have so far focused\nonly on high-symmetry zigzag edges.\nIn this Letter, we systematically study the electronic\nstructure of chiral GNRs using a self-consistent model\nHamiltonian approach including e\u2013e interactions. In particular, we investigate GNRs characterized by a broad\nrange of chiralities and widths as well as address the\neffects of varying e\u2013e interaction strength. Our study\nreveals that spin-polarized edge states are an intrinsic\nfeature of chiral GNRs, in agreement with the recent experimental observations. Moreover, we find a number\nof structure-property relations and unambiguous signatures of magnetic ordering of edge states which open new\n\nprospectives for their further exploration and for developing practical spintronic devices based on them.\nThe method employed in our study is based on the\nmean-field approximation to the Hubbard Hamiltonian\nX \u2020\n[ci\u03c3 cj\u03c3 + h.c.]+\nH=\u2212t\nhi,ji,\u03c3\n\n+U\n\nX\ni\n\n(ni\u2191 hni\u2193 i + hni\u2191 ini\u2193 \u2212 hni\u2191 ihni\u2193 i) .\n\n(1)\n\nThe first term is the nearest-neighbor tight-binding\nHamiltonian in which ci\u03c3 (c\u2020i\u03c3 ) annihilates (creates) an\nelectron with spin \u03c3 at site i, hi, ji stands for the nearest\nneighbor pairs of atoms, and t \u223c 3 eV [2]. The second\nterm accounts for e\u2013e interactions. The expectation values of the spin-resolved density ni\u03c3 = c\u2020i\u03c3 ci\u03c3 depend on\nthe eigenvectors of H.

Evolution of the tight-binding band structures (no e\u2013e interactions) of graphene nanoribbons (w = 12)\nupon the change of chirality from zigzag (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ) to armchair (\u03b8 = 30\u25e6 ) via the series of intermediate chiral configurations. The\nscales of the plots account for the varying Brillouin-zone dimensions. The insets show the relation between the one-dimensional\nband structures of zigzag and armchair GNRs and the two-dimensional band structure of ideal graphene.\n\nexperimental data [17]. However, we point out that this\neffective parameter may also incorporate environmental\nfactors such as the enhancement of screening due to the\nproximity of dielectric or metallic substrate [13]. For this\nreason we also study the dependence of results on U/t.\nTwo parameters determine the structure of smooth\nGNRs: (i) the crystallographic direction of the edge, and\n(ii) the width. In general, the direction of the nanoribbon's edge is defined by some translation vector (n,m)\nof the graphene lattice. For high-symmetry zigzag and\narmchair edges these vectors are (1,0) and (1,1), respectively. Provided that n > m, the edge of (n,m) nanoribbon is a repeating structure composed of n \u2212 m zigzag\nunits and m armchair units as illustrated for the particular case of a (4,1) GNR in Fig.\n\u221a 1(a). The length of\nrepeat vector a = (n, m) = a0 n2 + nm + m2 , where\na0 = 0.246 nm is the lattice constant of graphene. Alternatively, chirality\nby the chirality angle\nr \u0010 can be described\n\u0011\n2\nm\n. Zigzag and armchair edges\n\u03b8 = arcsin 34 n2 +nm+m\n2\nare characterized by \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 30\u25e6 , respectively,\nwhile for chiral edges 0\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 30\u25e6 . We consider chiral GNRs defined by edge translational vectors (n + 1,1)\nand (n,n + 1) (n \u2265 1). These two series cover the whole\nrange of chirality angles \u03b8 and converge to \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 and\n\u03b8 = 30\u25e6 , respectively, with increasing n [Fig. 1(b)]. The\nconfigurations of chiral GNRs considered\u221ain this study\ncover 4.7\u25e6 < \u03b8 < 25.3\u25e6 . The width W = 3wa0 cos \u03b8 of\na GNR is defined by vector (\u2212w,2w) pointing along the\narmchair direction as shown in Fig. 1(a).\nWe start our discussion by considering the evolution\nof tight-binding band structures of GNRs (neglecting e\u2013\ne interactions, U/t = 0) upon the change of chirality\nfrom zigzag (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ) to armchair (\u03b8 = 30\u25e6 ) via the series of intermediate chiral configurations at fixed nanoribbon width (w = 12). High-symmetry zigzag nanoribbon\n[Fig. 2, left panel] exhibits a flat band at the Fermi level\n(E = 0) which spans one-third of the 1D Brillouin zone\n(BZ), that is, the corresponding density of edge states\n\nper edge length per spin \u03c1(\u03b8 = 0\u25e6 ) = 1/(3a0 ). Armchair\nGNRs [Fig. 2, right panel] are either metals or semiconductors with no electronic states localized at the edges.\nThis result can be rationalized within the infinite-width\npicture by considering the 2D band structure of graphene\nprojected onto the 1D BZ of periodic edge. In the case\nof an armchair GNR both Dirac points (K and K \u2032 ) of\ngraphene's band structure are projected onto the \u0393 point\nof 1D BZ. However, for a zigzag GNR points K and K \u2032\nare projected onto k = 2\u03c0/(3a) and k = \u22122\u03c0/(3a), respectively, with zero-energy flat band connecting these\ntwo points [Fig. 2, insets]. The band structures of chiral\nGNRs in the infinite-width limit can be obtained by continuous rotation of the band structure of graphene which\nleads to the known result [15]:\n\u0010\n\u03c0\u0011\n2\n.\n(2)\ncos \u03b8 +\n\u03c1(\u03b8) =\n3a0\n3\nThat is, in the limit of large width only armchair GNRs\nshow no edge states. The density of edge states is largest\nfor zigzag nanoribbons and shows almost linear dependence on \u03b8. The tight-binding band structures of w = 12\nchiral GNRs [Fig. 2; the x-axis scales correspond to the\n1D BZ dimensions] confirm this picture. Two important comments should be made: (i) in finite-width GNRs\nwith edge orientation close to the armchair direction zeroenergy edge states are partially or even completely suppressed; (ii) in GNRs with edge orientation close to the\nzigzag direction the flat edge-state band spans whole 1D\nBZ and becomes multiple degenerate due to band folding.\nWe now discuss the effects of e\u2013e interactions on the\nelectronic spectra of chiral GNRs. Figure 3(a) shows the\nband structure and the density of states (DOS) plot for\na zigzag GNR (w = 12) obtained within the mean-field\nHubbard model (U/t = 1) compared to the tight-binding\nresults (U/t = 0).

At U/t = 1\nspin-polarized ground states of few-nm-wide GNRs span\nalmost full range of chiralities [Fig. 4(a)]. The magnetic moments per unit length M follow closely the\ndotted curve which corresponds to the complete spinpolarization of edge states in the infinite-width limit\n(2), but appear to be negatively shifted by nearly constant amounts which are moderately dependent on width.\nSplitting \u22061 shows a similar dependence on \u03b8 and it is\nindependent of w [Fig. 4(b)]. On the contrary, the magnitude of \u22060 is largely insensitive to the variations of\n\u03b8 in broad ranges of this parameter, but shows a clear\ndependence on w analogous to the case of zigzag GNRs\n[19]. As the chiral angle \u03b8 approaches 30\u25e6 magnetic moments vanish and the tight-binding band gaps \u2206g quickly\nrise reaching their maximum values for the corresponding armchair GNRs [22]. Figure 4(c) reveal a moderate\ndependence of M (\u03b8) on the strength of e\u2013e interactions.\nHowever, the magnitudes of \u22060 and \u22061 are both approximately proportional to U/t [Fig. 4(d)].\nFinally, we turn our attention to the spatial variation of\nelectronic spectra of magnetic graphene edges in relation\n(a)\n\n(b) 0.3\nw = 18\nw = 12\nw=6\n\n\u22060 \u22061 \u2206g\nw = 18\nw = 12\nw=6\n\n0.2\n\u2206/t\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n20\n\u03b8 (deg.)\n\n(c)\n\n30\n\n0\n\n10\n20\n\u03b8 (deg.)\n\n(d) 0.5\n\n0.3\n\nU/t = 1.5\nU/t = 1\nU/t = 0.5\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206/t\n\nM (\u03bcB /a0)\n\nnanoribbon [4]. The magnetic moment per edge unit\nlength M = 0.313\u03bcB /a0 . Spin-polarization lifts the degeneracy of edge states and opens an electronic band gap\n\u22060 . While the tight-binding DOS has only one van Hove\nsingularity related to the presence of 1D edge states at\nE = 0, the mean-field Hubbard model solution shows two\npairs of peaks split by \u22060 and \u22061 . We note that Hamiltonian (1) respects electron-hole symmetry. Splitting \u22060\nis related to magnetic correlation between the opposite\nedges while the larger splitting \u22061 is due to the FM correlation along one single edge of most strongly localized\nelectronic states at k = \u03c0/a [6, 20, 21]. Thus, the two\nsplittings \u22060 and \u22061 constitute independent signatures\nof magnetic ordering across the nanoribbon and along its\nedge. The rest of electronic spectrum (|E| > 0.18t) is\nnegligibly affected by the Hubbard term. Van Hove singularities at |E| \u2248 0.2t and higher energies correspond to\nthe bulk-like states subjected to quantum confinement in\n1D GNRs of the given width. The mean-field Hubbard\nmodel electronic spectra of chiral GNRs show all the features characteristic of zigzag GNRs provided the ground\nstate is spin-polarized. Both splittings, especially \u22061 , are\nreduced in the case of (2,1) GNR (\u03b8 = 19.1\u25e6 ) due to the\nsmaller magnetic moment M = 0.096\u03bcB/a0 [Fig. 3(b)].\nNanoribbons with chirality close to \u03b8 = 0\u25e6 show additional pairs of van Hove singularities due to splittings of\nthe multiple degenerate edge-state bands at k = 0 and\n\nM (\u03bcB /a0)\n\n0.3\n\n30\n\n\u22060 \u22061\nU/t = 1.5\nU/t = 1\nU/t = 0.5\n\u2206g\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n20\n\u03b8 (deg.)\n\n30\n\n0\n\n10\n20\n\u03b8 (deg.)\n\n30\n\nFIG. 4: (color online).

Variation of the local density of states\n(LDOS) (a) across the (6,1) chiral GNR (x-axis is oriented\nalong the edge; y = 0 corresponds to the outermost edge\natom) and (b) along its edge obtained using the mean-field\nHubbard model (U/t = 1). (c),(d) Log-linear plots of LDOS\nat the energies indicated in panel (a) across the (6,1) chiral\nGNR and along its edge, respectively. The dashed lines correspond to the tight-binding LDOS at E = 0. The inset in\npanel (d) superimposes the edge structure with the plot.\n\nto the experimental observations [13]. As a case study\nwe investigate the mean-field Hubbard model (U/t = 1)\nlocal density of states (LDOS) evaluated across the (6,1)\nchiral GNR (w = 12, W = 5 nm) [Fig. 5(a)] and along its\nedge [Fig. 5(b)]. We find that both pairs of contributions\nto the total DOS due to the edge states seen in Fig. 3(c)\nare localized at the edge. However, the higher-energy\nLDOS peak at E = 0.1t decays very fast being confined\nwithin the 1-nm-wide edge region while the lower-energy\nfeature at E = 0.035t penetrates deep into the middle of\nGNR. The series of peaks at E & 0.2t repeated in energy\nby \u2248 0.1t correspond to the bulk-like graphene states\nsubjected to quantum confinement. The total density of\nedge states from the tight-binding calculations shows pronounced oscillations along the GNR edge [dashed curve\nin Fig. 5(d)]. The oscillation period corresponds to the\nedge periodicity a = 1.6 nm. The E = 0.1t LDOS peak\nfrom the mean-field Hubbard model follows this trend.\nIn contrast, the lower-energy peak (E = 0.035t) shows\nweak variations of LDOS. This behavior was found to be\ngeneric to all studied chiral and zigzag magnetic GNRs.\nTo summarize, our model Hamiltonian study of the\nelectronic structure and magnetic properties of chiral\ngraphene nanoribbons revealed a number of structureproperty relations. The described relations can serve\nas unambiguous signatures of edge-state magnetism in\n\n[1] A. K. Geim and K. S. Novoselov, Nature Mater. 6, 183\n(2007); M. I.
