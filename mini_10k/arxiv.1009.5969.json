Introduction\nSince the seminal papers by Saffman & Taylor (1958) and Taylor & Saffman (1959)\nthe motion of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell, where the fluids are confined between two\nclosely spaced parallel plates, has attracted a great deal of attention. Because the\nproblem is amenable to analytic treatment, particularly in the case when surface\ntension effects are neglected, many exact solutions have been found for both steady\nand time-dependent flows. A comprehensive list of references, up to 1998, on HeleShaw flows was compiled by S. D. Howison (people.maths.ox.ac.uk/howison/HeleShaw). Hele-Shaw flows have also recently been recognized as having deep connections with other areas of mathematical physics (Mineev-Weinstein et al. 2000,\nGustafsson & Vasil'ev 2006). Exact solutions for Hele-Shaw flows are thus of interest not only for their eventual physical significance but also on their own right for\nthey are solutions to a difficult free-boundary problem. Some known exact solutions\nfor the motion of bubbles and fingers in a Hele-Shaw cell were briefly reviewed by\nVasconcelos (2001). More recently, other exact solutions have been found, such as\ntime-dependent solutions for Hele-Shaw flows around a wedge (Cummings 1999,\nRichardson 2001b,c, Vasconcelos 2007) and solutions for multiple steady bubbles in\na Hele-Shaw cell with no assumed symmetry obtained by Crowdy (2009a,b).\nExact solutions for a periodic stream of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell have also\nbeen found. The first of such solutions was obtained by Burgess & Tanveer (1991)\nfor a stream of bubbles in the channel geometry with one bubble per unit cell. In\nthe limit that the period is taken to infinity their solution recovers the solution\noriginally given by Taylor & Saffman (1959) for a single bubble in a channel. Exact\nsolutions for a stream of bubbles in an unbounded Hele-Shaw cell were subsequently\nfound by Vasconcelos (1993). The Burgess-Tanveer solution was later generalized\nby Vasconcelos (1994) for a wider class of solutions with an arbitrary number of\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\nTEX Paper\n\n\f2\n\nAnt\u00f4nio M. P. Silva and Giovani L. Vasconcelos\n\nsymmetrical bubbles per unit cell. Here again taking the period to infinity yields\nsolutions with an arbitrary but finite number of symmetrical bubbles in a HeleShaw channel (Vasconcelos 2001). It is worth mentioning that a periodic solution\nin a Hele-Shaw channel can be extended to the entire plane by successive reflections\nat the channel walls thus yielding a doubly-periodic solution in an unbounded cell.\nIn this context, exact solutions for doubly-periodic flows in a Hele-Shaw cell are of\ninterest not only from a mathematical viewpoint, for they correspond to a more\ngeneral situation, but also from a physical perspective because in certain cases they\ncan be realized as a stream of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel and hence may\n(in principle) be susceptible to experimental investigation. A brief experimental\nstudy of a stream of bubbles rising in an inclined Hele-Shaw cell was reported by\nMaxworthy (1986).\nIn the present paper, we report a rather general class of exact solutions for a\ndoubly-periodic array of steadily moving bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell. Our generic\nsolutions are valid in an unbounded Hele-Shaw cell but there is a large subclass of\nsolutions that correspond to a stream of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel. To render\nthe problem analytically tractable, we neglect surface tension effects and suppose\nthat the bubbles either are symmetrical with respect to the channel centreline or\nhave fore-and-aft symmetry (or both), so that the flow domain can be reduced to\na simply-connected unit cell. By using conformal mapping techniques, a general\nsolution for any number of bubbles per unit cell is obtained in integral form. Our\nsolution represents the most general periodic solution for a stream of bubbles in a\nHele-Shaw cell, in the sense that all previously known periodic solutions are particular cases of the solutions reported here. Furthermore, our solutions include several\nnovel configurations that were not obtained before, such as the case of a staggered\ntwo-file array of bubbles in a channel that somewhat resembles the \"zipper\"-like\nflows of red cells in capillaries (Sugihara-Seki & Fu 2005). Also presented are solutions with \"mixed symmetry\" in the channel geometry where within a given bubble\nconfiguration some bubbles have fore-and-aft symmetry and others are symmetrical\nabout the channel centreline. Examples are also given of solutions that cannot be\nrestricted to the channel geometry and hence must necessarily be considered in an\nunbounded Hele-Shaw cell.\n\n2. Mathematical formulation\nWe consider the problem of a doubly-periodic array of bubbles moving with a\nconstant velocity U along the x-direction in an unbounded Hele-Shaw cell. For\nconvenience, we shall work in a reference frame moving with the bubbles in which\nthe flow is steady and the bubbles stationary. We assume that the solutions have\nstreamwise and spanwise periods of 2L and 2a, respectively, and so we reduce the\nproblem to a rectangular unit cell, as shown in Fig. 1. We place the origin of our\nsystem of coordinates at the centre of the unit cell, so that its upper and lower edges\nare at y = \u00b1a and the left and right edges at x = \u00b1L. We shall assume furthermore\nthat the bubble configuration is symmetrical with respect to reflections about the\nfollowing four axes: x = 0, x = L, y = 0, and y = a. With this assumption we only\nneed to consider the problem in a reduced unit cell corresponding to one quarter,\nsay, the upper-right quarter, of the original unit cell; see Fig. 2(a).\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f3\n\nDoubly-periodic array of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell\ny\na\n\n-L\n\nL\n\nx\n\n-a\nFigure 1. The unit cell for a doubly-periodic array of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell.\n\nNow let D denote the domain occupied by the fluid within the reduced unit cell.\nFor simplicity of notation, we shall denote by C a generic bubble-fluid interface. As\nis usual for Hele-Shaw flows, we introduce the complex potential W (z) = \u03c6 + i\u03c8,\nwhere z = x + iy, \u03c6(x, y) is the velocity potential, and \u03c8(x, y) is the associated\nstream function. We recall that the velocity potential (in the moving frame) is\ngiven by \u03c6(x, y) = \u2212(b2 p/12\u03bc) \u2212 U x, where b is the gap between the cell plates, \u03bc\nis the viscosity, and p is the fluid pressure. The complex potential W (z) must be\nanalytic in the fluid domain D and satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions, as\nwe now discuss.\nThe pressure inside a bubble is assumed to be constant and surface tension\neffects are neglected. The complex potential W must then satisfy the following\ncondition on a fluid-bubble interface C\nW = \u2212U x + C\n\non C,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere C is a complex-valued constant. (The value of the constant C depends on the\nspecific bubble one considers and is related to the position of the bubble centroid.)\nThe complex potential must also satisfy specific conditions on the boundaries of\nthe unit cell, as follows. Given that the upper and lower edges of our unit cell are\nstreamlines of the flow and that the left and right edges are equipotentials, we must\nthen have\nIm W = 0 on y = 0,\n(2.2)\nIm W = (V \u2212 U )a\nRe W = 0\n\non y = a,\n\non x = 0,\n\nRe W = \u2212\u1e7c L on x = L,\n\n(2.3)\n(2.4)\n(2.5)\n\nwhere Im and Re denote real and imaginary parts, respectively. Here V is the\naverage velocity across the unit cell in the x-direction in the lab frame and \u1e7c is\na positive constant whose physical meaning will become clear shortly. An explicit\nexpression for \u1e7c in terms of L, V and the total area J occupied by the bubbles\n(within a unit cell) can be obtained.

In view of Eqs. (2.1)\u2013(2.5), one readily sees that the flow domain in the\nW -plane corresponds to a rectangle, \u2212\u1e7c L < \u03c6 < 0, \u2212(U \u2212 V )a < \u03c8 < 0, as\nshown in Fig. 2(b). Bubbles placed along the left and right edges of the unit cell\nin the z-plane are mapped onto horizontal slits in the W -plane, whereas bubbles\non the streamlines y = 0 and y = a are mapped onto segments along the lines\n\u03c8 = \u2212a(U \u2212 V ) and \u03c8 = 0, respectively; see Fig. 2(b). Note that the horizontal\nslits on Fig. 2(b) correspond to the respective halves of the bubbles on the left\nand right edges that are within the reduced unit cell and hence such slits always\npenetrate into the rectangular domain in the W -plane.\nAs discussed in detail elsewhere (Tian & Vasconcelos 1993, Vasconcelos 2001),\nsteady Hele-Shaw flows have an interesting rotation invariance in the following\nsense: if a curve C is a solution for a bubble moving with constant velocity U along\nthe x-direction in an unbounded Hele-Shaw cell, then the curve C \u0303 obtained from a\nrotation of C about the origin by an angle \u03b1 is also a solution with the same velocity\nU . Alternatively, one can view the rotated solution as one in which the bubble itself\nis kept fixed while its velocity is rotated by an angle \u03b1. In view of the rectangular\ngeometry of our unit cell, it is particularly relevant for us here to consider a rotation\nby 90\u25e6 , where the bubbles move with the same velocity U as in the original solution\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\fDoubly-periodic array of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell\n\n5\n\nbut now in the y-direction. In this case, the region occupied by the fluid in the\nrotated solution is exactly the same as that for the original problem, the main\ndifference being that the upper and lower edges of the unit cell which are streamlines\nin the original solution become equipotentials in the rotated problem, whereas the\nleft and right edges which were originally equipotentials become streamlines.\nAs shown by Vasconcelos (2001), the complex potential W\u0303 (z) for the rotated\nproblem (in the corresponding moving frame) is given by\nW\u0303 (z) = i [W (z) + U z] .\n\n(2.7)\n\nFrom (2.1)\u2013(2.5) and (2.7) it then follows that the rotated complex potential W\u0303 (z)\nsatisfies the following boundary conditions:\nW\u0303 = \u2212U y + iC\n\non C.\n\n(2.8)\n\nRe W\u0303 = 0 on y = 0,\n\n(2.9)\n\nRe W\u0303 = \u2212V a\n\non y = a,\n\n(2.10)\n\nIm W\u0303 = 0 on x = 0,\n\n(2.11)\n\nIm W\u0303 = (U \u2212 \u1e7c )L on x = L,\n\n(2.12)\n\nFrom (2.12) one now sees that the parameter \u1e7c corresponds to the average fluid\nvelocity (in the lab frame) in the y-direction of the rotated flow. The flow domain\nfor the rotated problem in the W\u0303 -plane corresponds to a rectangle, \u2212V a < \u03c6\u0303 < 0,\nU L \u2212 \u03c60 < \u03c8\u0303 < 0, with horizontal slits corresponding to the bubbles placed on\ny = 0 and y = a, as shown in Fig. 2(c). [For the same reasons as discussed before,\nthese horizontal slits always penetrate into the bounded domain in W\u0303 -plane.]\nConsider now the conformal mapping z(\u03b6) from the upper half-\u03b6-plane onto\nthe fluid domain in the z-plane, so that the boundary \u2202D of the fluid domain in\nthe z-plane is mapped onto the real axis of the \u03b6-plane, as shown in Fig. 2(d). In\nparticular, a bubble C will be the image under z(\u03b6) of a corresponding interval I\non the real-\u03b6-axis (see below). For definiteness, we also choose to map the point\n\u03b6 = \u221e to an arbitrary point on the upper edge between the left-upper corner and\nthe next bubble; see Fig. 2. In the most general configuration, one has one bubble\non each corner and an arbitrary number of bubbles on each edge of the cell. To\nkeep track of all the bubbles, let us denote by Cic , i = 1, ..., 4, the bubble on the\nith corner, with the corners numbered anti-clockwise starting from the upper left\ncorner. Under the map z(\u03b6) a corner bubble Cic will be image of the interval Iic on\nthe real-\u03b6-axis defined by\n\u001a\n(\u03b1i , \u03b2i ), i = 2, 4\nIic \u2261\n(2.13)\n(\u03b2i , \u03b1i ), i = 1, 3.\n(The reason for distinguishing between even and odd corners is one of convenience,\nfor with the above choice one has that in the W -plane the corners are the images\nof the points \u03b6 = \u03b1i , whereas in the W\u0303 -plane the corners corresponds to \u03b6 = \u03b2i ;\nsee Fig. 2.) Note that if we want a configuration with no bubble in the i-th corner,\nfor a given i, we must simply set \u03b1i = \u03b2i .\nSimilarly, we shall denote the bubbles on the edges of the unit cell by Cia , where\nthe superscript refers to the corresponding side, with a = l, r, u, d, indicating left,\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f6\n\nAnt\u00f4nio M. P. Silva and Giovani L. Vasconcelos\n\nright, up and down, respectively, and i = 1, ..., na , where na is the number of\nbubbles on the respective edge. In the \u03b6-plane a given bubble Cia will correspond to\nan interval Iia on the real axis defined by\na\na\nIia \u2261 (\u03bd2i\u22121\n, \u03bd2i\n),\n\ni = 1, ..., na .\n\n(2.14)\n\nOwing to the three degrees of freedom allowed by the Riemann's mapping theorem,\nwe could arbitrarily fix the values of three parameters, chosen among \u03b1i , \u03b2i or \u03bdia .\nAt this stage, however, it is best to consider all such quantities as free parameters,\ndeferring to the examples the moment when we shall need to fix the appropriate\nparameters.\nWith some abuse of notation let us now write\nW (\u03b6) \u2261 W (z(\u03b6))\n\nand W\u0303 (\u03b6) \u2261 W\u0303 (z(\u03b6)),\n\nso that the functions W (\u03b6) and W\u0303 (\u03b6) can be viewed as the conformal mappings from\nthe upper half-\u03b6-plane onto the flow domains in the W - and W\u0303 -planes, respectively.\nIt then follows from (2.7) that the mapping z(\u03b6) can be written as\nz(\u03b6) = \u2212\n\ni\n1 h\nW (\u03b6) + iW\u0303 (\u03b6) .\nU\n\n(2.15)\n\nOnce the mappings W (\u03b6) and W\u0303 (\u03b6) are known, the bubble interface Cia can then\nbe readily computed from (2.15) by setting \u03b6 = s, for s \u2208 Iia .\nSummarizing our procedure so far, we have reduced our original free-boundary\nproblem to the much simpler problem of obtaining two conformal mappings, namely,\nW (\u03b6) and W\u0303 (\u03b6), from the upper half-\u03b6-plane onto respective rectangular domains in\nthe W - and W\u0303 -planes. As we will see shortly, such mappings can be easily obtained\nfrom the Schwarz-Christoffel formula (Carrier et al. 1983). It should also be noted\nthat in previous solutions that use conformal mapping (see, e.g. Tanveer 1987),\nonce the mapping W (\u03b6) from the chosen domain in the \u03b6-plane to the flow domain\nin the W -plane is known, then the mapping z = f (\u03b6) is constructed explicitly so as\nto satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions. Our method has the advantage of\nmaking this step rather straighforward by identifying the function W\u0303 (z) = i[W (z)+\nU z] with the complex potential for the rotated problem, so that solving for the\nmapping W\u0303 (\u03b6) then completes the solution. Before presenting our general solutions,\nhowever, it is worthwhile to point out some special features of the solutions for the\nthe case U = 2V .\nSolutions with U = 2V are special in the sense that solutions for any U > V can\nbe generated by a proper rescaling of the solutions for the former case (Vasconcelos\n2001). To show this, we first note that from inspection of the flow domain in the\nW -plane [Fig. 2(b)] it follows that the mapping WU (\u03b6), for given a and any U > V ,\ncan be obtained from the corresponding mapping W2V (\u03b6), for U = 2V , by the\nrelation\nU \u2212V\nW2V (\u03b6).\n(2.16)\nWU (\u03b6) =\nV\nIn particular, the velocity \u1e7c [see Fig. 2(b)] for both cases are related by\n\u1e7cU =\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\nU \u2212V\n\u1e7c2V .\nV\n\n(2.17)\n\n\fDoubly-periodic array of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell\n\n7\n\nSimilarly, inspection of the flow domain in the W\u0303 -plane [see Fig. 2(c)] reveals that\nW\u0303U (\u03b6) = W\u03032V (\u03b6),\n\n(2.18)\n\n(U \u2212 \u1e7cU )LU = (2V \u2212 \u1e7c2V )L2V .\n\n(2.19)\n\nwith\nInserting (2.17) into (2.19) yields the half-period LU in terms of the corresponding\nvalue L2V for the case U = 2V :\nLU =\n\nV (2V \u2212 \u1e7c2V )\nL2V .\nU V \u2212 (U \u2212 V )\u1e7c2V\n\n(2.20)\n\nIt then follows from (2.15), (2.16) and (2.18) that for any U > V the mapping\nzU (\u03b6) can be written in terms of the solutions for U = 2V as\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nU\n1\n\u2212 1 W2V (\u03b6) + iW\u03032V (\u03b6) ,\n(2.21)\nzU (\u03b6) = \u2212\nU\nV\nwhich can be more conveniently rewritten as\nzU (\u03b6) = \u2212\nwhere\n\ni\n1 h\n(1 + \u03c1)W2V (\u03b6) + i(1 \u2212 \u03c1)W\u03032V (\u03b6) ,\n2V\n\u03c1=1\u2212\n\n2V\n,\nU\n\n(2.22)\n\n(2.23)\n\nwith \u03c1 \u2208 (\u22121, 1). This result thus shows that solutions for any U > V can be\nobtained by an appropriate rescaling of the solution with U = 2V (Vasconcelos\n2001). In view of this property, we shall only consider the case U = 2V in the\nremainder of the paper. Without loss of generality we will also set V = 1 and a = 1\nhenceforth.\n\n3. General solutions\nAs indicated in Fig. 2(b), the flow domain in the W -plane is a rectangle with nl\n(nr ) horizontal slits corresponding to the bubbles on the left (right) side of the unit\ncell. This domain can be viewed as a degenerate polygon and so the corresponding\nmapping W (\u03b6) can be obtained from the Schwarz-Christoffel formula (Carrier et\nal. 1983).

Vasconcelos\n\nwith nd (nu ) horizontal slits emanating from the right (left) side of the rectangle.\nBy the same reasoning as before, we obtain that the map W\u0303 (\u03b6) is determined by\ndW\u0303\n= \u2212iK\u0303 \"\nd\u03b6\n4\nQ\n\nnd\nQ\n\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b3id )\n\ni=1\n\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b2i )\n\ni=1\n\nn\nQu\n\nj=1\n\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03b3ju )\n\n\u0001 2n\nQu\nd\n\n2n\nQd\n\n\u03b6 \u2212 \u03bdj\n\nj=1\n\nk=1\n\n#1/2 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\n(\u03b6 \u2212 \u03bdku )\n\nwhere again K\u0303 and \u03b3ia are real-valued constants to be determined.

To see this, first note that K can be calculated from\nthe requirement that as we go from point B to point F in Fig. 2(d) the complex\npotential W in Fig. 2(b) must vary by i (recall that we have made U = 2, V = 1,\nand a = 1), and so we write\nF\n\n[W ]B \u2261 W (F ) \u2212 W (B) = i,\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhich yields\n\nK \u22121 = \u2212i\n\nZ\n\nnlP\n+nr\n\n\u03b12\n\n\u03b11\n\naj tj dt\n\nj=0\n\n\"\n\n4\nQ\n\n(t \u2212 \u03b1i )\n\ni=1\n\n2n\nQl\n\nj=1\n\n\u0001 2n\nQr\nl\n\nt \u2212 \u03bdj\n\nk=1\n\n#1/2 .\n\n(3.10)\n\n(t \u2212 \u03bdkr )\n\nThe constant K\u0303 follows from similar requirement:\nh iG\n\u2261 W\u0303 (G) \u2212 W\u0303 (A) = 1,\nW\u0303\n\n(3.11)\n\nA\n\nwhich yields\n\nK\u0303 \u22121 =\n\nZ\n\nndP\n+nu\n\n\u03b22\n\n\u03b21\n\nbj tj dt\n\nj=0\n\n\"\n\n4\nQ\n\n|t \u2212 \u03b2i |\n\ni=1\n\n2n\nQd\n\nj=1\n\nt \u2212 \u03bdjd\n\n2n\nQu\n\nk=1\n\n|t \u2212 \u03bdku |\n\n#1/2 .\n\n(3.12)\n\nWe have thus seen that the generic solution described in (3.3) and (3.4) is\ncompletely specified by prescribing the set of free parameters \u03b1i , \u03b2i and \u03bdia , from\nwhich all other constants appearing in the solution can be calculated.

We suppose the channel walls are\nat y = \u00b11, so that y = 0 corresponds to the channel centreline. For this case we set\nin the generic solution given in (3.3) and (3.4) the following conditions\n\u03b11 = \u03b21 = \u22121,\n\n\u03b14 = \u03b24 = 1,\n\nnu = 0,\n\n(4.1)\n\nsince there can be no bubble attached to the channel walls. Thus, for the case\nof a periodic array of bubbles in the channel geometry the solution is completely\nspecified by prescribing the following set of free parameters: {\u03b1i }i=2,3 , {\u03b2i }i=2,3 ,\nand {\u03bdia }i=1,...,2na , with a = l, r, d. (Recall that from the third degree of freedom\nallowed by the Riemann mapping theorem one of these parameters can be kept\nfixed.) We also note that the generic solutions for multiple bubbles in a Hele-Shaw\nchannel presented by Vasconcelos (2001) can be obtained as special case of our\nperiodic solution above in the limit L \u2192 \u221e. This can be accomplished by simply\nsetting \u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u22121 and \u03b23 = \u03b24 = 1 in Fig. 2(d). In what follows we shall discuss\nsome specific examples of periodic solutions in a Hele-Shaw channel.\nWe start with the case of a single bubble per unit cell. In the notation of Fig. 1\nthis is achieved by placing a bubble at the lower left corner of the reduced unit cell\nand no other bubble anywhere. In this case we reproduce the exact solution for an\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f12\n\nAnt\u00f4nio M. P. Silva and Giovani L.

For completeness we show in Fig. 3\nan example of the Burgess-Tanveer solution. Note, in particular, that in this case\nthe bubble is placed at the centre of the unit cell and therefore has both centreline\nand fore-and-aft symmetry.\nAs the next example, we consider the situation in which there are bubbles only\neither at the lower edge or at the left edge of our reduced unit cell. Examples of\nthese two cases are shown in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b). In such cases we recover the class of\nperiodic solutions with centreline symmetry or fore-and-aft symmetry, respectively,\nobtained earlier by Vasconcelos (1994). It should be noted, however, that in the\nwork by Vasconcelos (1994) no specific example was given, only the general method\nof solution was presented. In this sense, this is the first time that explicit solutions\nfor such symmetrical configurations have been calculated.\nNext we note that novel solutions can be generated if we place bubbles simultaneously at the left and at the right edges of the reduced unit cell (and nowhere else).\nFor example, in Fig. 5 we show a solution with two bubbles per unit cell, where\neach bubble has fore-and-aft symmetry but they lie in different equipotentials of the\nflow. Seen in the laboratory frame, this solution corresponds to a staggered two-file\narray of bubbles moving steadily down the channel. It is interesting to notice that\nsimilar zipper-like arrangements are observed in the flow of red cells in capillaries\n(Sugihara-Seki & Fu 2005).\nAnother type of new solutions includes the case of \"mixed symmetry\" where\nsome bubbles have centreline symmetry and some others have fore-and-aft symmetry. An example of such case is the multi-file array of bubbles shown in Fig. 6,\nwhere there is one file of bubbles symmetrical about the channel centreline, with the\nother files of bubbles having fore-and-aft symmetry.

We begin by noting that if there are bubbles\nplaced on the upper and lower edges of our reduced unit cell, then the solutions\ncannot be reduced to the channel geometry as before, and so one must considered\nan unbounded Hele-Shaw cell. An example of such case is given in Fig. 8. It is\nworth mentioning that this type of solution represents the most general solution for\na periodic array of (symmetrical) bubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell, in the sense that the\nother types of solution can be obtained by either 'decimating' or 'adding' bubbles\nalong any of the edges of the reduced unit cell.\n\n5. Conclusions and Discussion\nWe have presented an exact solution for a doubly-periodic array of steadily moving\nbubbles in a Hele-Shaw cell with an arbitrary number of bubbles per unit cell.\nOur solution represents the most general periodic solution for bubbles in a HeleShaw cell known to date, in the sense that the previously known solutions for\na stream of bubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel are particular cases of the solutions\nreported here. In addition, our solution includes novel cases of periodic arrays of\nbubbles in a Hele-Shaw channel, such as multi-file flow of symmetrical bubbles and\nconfigurations with mixed symmetry, where some bubbles have centreline symmetry\nwhile others have fore-and-aft symmetry. Examples of a doubly-periodic array of\nbubbles in an unbounded cell that cannot be restricted to the channel geometry\nwere also discussed.\nIn constructing our solutions we assumed that the bubbles either are symmetrical either with respect to the cell centreline or have fore-and-aft symmetry (or\nboth), so that the relevant flow domain can be reduced to a simply-connected unit\ncell. In this context, the existence of periodic solutions in a Hele-Shaw cell without any symmetry requirement, where the unit cell is no longer simply-connected,\nremains an open and interesting question. Recently, a new methodology to treat\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f14\n\nAnt\u00f4nio M. P. Silva and Giovani L. Vasconcelos\n\nHele-Shaw flows in multiply-connected domains has been developed by Richardson (2001a) and Crowdy (2009a,b). In particular, solutions for a finite number of\nasymmetric steadily-moving bubbles have been found both in an infinite Hele-Shaw\ncell (Crowdy 2009a) and in the channel geometry (Crowdy 2009b). It is therefore\nlikely that our solutions can be generalized to include the case of a periodic array of\nasymmetric bubbles. This interesting (and more difficult) problem clearly deserves\nto be studied further.\nAnother interesting point to be investigated is the effect of surface tension on\nthe shape and velocity of our periodic array of bubbles. From previous works on\nthe related problem for a single bubble (Tanveer 1986, 1987; Combescot & Dombre 1988) as well for the Burgess-Tanveer periodic solution (Burgess & Tanveer\n1991), one expects that the 'degeneracy' displayed by our solutions, meaning that\nfixing the geometrical parameters of the solution does not fix the bubble velocity U , will most certainly be removed by surface tension. However, it is not clear\nwhich particular bubble arrangements, among our large class of solutions, will have\ncounterparts in the case of nonzero surface tension. For instance, in the case of a\nsingle bubble in a Hele-Shaw channel, Tanveer (1987) was unable to find solutions\nwithout symmetry with respect to channel centreline, even though such nonsymmetric solutions exist when surface tension is neglected. In light of these results, it\nappears that periodic solutions with centreline symmetry are more likely to 'survive' in the nonzero surface tension scenario. Unfortunately, however, the search\nfor solutions with surface tension has to be performed numerically-a task that is\nlikely to become increasingly more demanding as the number of bubble grows.\nThis work was supported in part by the Brazilian agencies FINEP, CNPq, and FACEPE\nand by the special programs PRONEX and CT-PETRO.\n\nReferences\nBurgess, D. & Tanveer, S. 1991 Infinite stream of Hele-Shaw bubbles.
