Introduction\nThe objects that we study in this article are special algebraic curves defined by\nreduced, or inhomogeneous, A-discriminantal polynomials; and more specifically,\nthe coamoebas of these A-discriminantal curves. Such a coamoeba is the image\nof the curve under the simple mapping that takes each complex coordinate to its\nargument. The notion of A-discriminants was originally introduced by Gelfand,\nKapranov, and Zelevinsky, and the monograph [3] contains a thorough account of\nthe subject. Here we just recall a few facts that will help put our results in proper\nperspective. The starting point is a finite configuration A of points \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1N\nin Zn , and the corresponding family of Laurent polynomials\nf (x) =\n\nN\nX\n\n\u00b11\nak x\u03b1k \u2208 C[x\u00b11\n1 , . . . , xn ]\n\nk=1\n\nwith exponent vectors from A. Granted some generically satisfied conditions, see\n[3], the set of coefficients vectors (a1 , . . . , aN ), for which the hypersurface Zf =\n{ x \u2208 Cn\u2217 ; f (x) = 0 } is not a smooth manifold, coincides with the zero locus of an\nirreducible polynomial DA \u2208 Z[a1 , . . . , aN ]. This A-discriminant DA is uniquely\ndetermined up to sign, provided its coefficients are taken to be relatively prime,\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nand its dependence on the point configuration A is such that it remains invariant\nunder Z-affine isomorphisms.\nAs is customary in this context, we will make a slight abuse of notation, and\ndenote by A also the associated (1 + n) \u00d7 N -matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 ... 1\n(1)\nA=\n,\n\u03b11 . . . \u03b1 N\nwith the \u03b1k here being viewed as column vectors. We shall make two standard\nassumptions on the matrix A, and consequently also on the corresponding point\nconfiguration:\n\u2022 rank(A) = 1 + n, so in particular N > n;\n\u2022 the maximal minors of A are relatively prime.\nThe latter condition means that the columns of A generate the full lattice Z1+n .\nEach row vector of the matrix A corresponds to a (quasi-)homogeneity of the\nA-discriminant, which means that DA can actually be considered as a function of\nonly m := N \u2212 n \u2212 1 essential variables. An explicit method for dehomogenizing\nthe A-discriminant consists in choosing a Gale transform of A. This is simply an\ninteger N \u00d7 m-matrix B, whose column vectors form a Z-basis for the kernel of the\nlinear map represented by the matrix A. The row vectors b1 , b2 , . . . , bN of B then\nconstitute a point configuration in Zm which is said to be a Gale transform of the\noriginal configuration A, see Section 5.4 of [4]. Now, the column vectors of B can\nbe used to produce new inhomogeneous coordinates for DA by the rule\nxk = ab11k ab22k * * * abNN k ,\n\nk = 1, . . . , m .\n\nMore precisely, one has a formula DA (a1 , . . . , aN ) = M (a) DB (x1 , . . . , xm ), where\nM (a) is a monomial in the original a-variables and DB is the corresponding reduced\nA-discriminant. It is natural to denote this reduced discriminant by DB , for it is\nthe choice of the matrix B that determines it. In fact, one could equally well start\nthe whole theory from a B-matrix whose row vectors sum up to zero, and then take\na Gale transform A of the special form (1), which will be uniquely determined up\nto a Z-affine isomorphism. Note that for this to work B should not contain any\nrow with only zeros.\nIn this paper we are going to focus on the case where N = n + 3, so that m = 2,\nand the reduced A-discriminant is a function of two variables. Before proceeding,\nlet us look at three simple cases, which we will follow throughout the paper.\nExamples. (i ) Consider first the trivial A-matrix A = (1 1 1), which amounts\nto the case of dimension n = 0. It is then natural to define the corresponding\nA-discriminant to be the linear form DA = a1 + a2 + a3 , and a suitable B-matrix\nfor this case is given by\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u22121 \u22121\nB = \uf8ed 1 0 \uf8f8.\n0 1\n\u22121\nWriting x1 = a\u22121\n1 a2 and x2 = a1 a3 , we then have DA (a) = a1 DB (x) with\nDB (x) = 1 + x1 + x2 .\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n3\n\n(ii ) Now let n = 1 and let A be the configuration \u03b1k = k \u2212 1 with k = 1, 2, 3, 4.\nThat is, we have the matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1 1 1\n.\nA=\n0 1 2 3\nThe corresponding A-discriminant is given by\nDA (a) = 27a21 a24 + 4a1 a33 + 4a32 a4 \u2212 18a1 a2 a3 a4 \u2212 a22 a23 ,\nand we recognize it as the classical cubic discriminant that vanishes precisely when\nthe algebraic equation a1 + a2 x + a3 x2 + a4 x3 = 0 has some multiple root. A Gale\ntransform of A is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0\n\uf8ec 0 1 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nB=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u22123 \u22122 \uf8f8 ,\n2 1\n\u22123 2\n\u22122\nand one has DA (a) = a63 a\u22122\n4 DB (x) with x1 = a1 a3 a4 , x2 = a2 a3 a4 , so the\nreduced A-discriminant is given by DB (x) = 27x21 + 4x1 + 4x32 \u2212 18x1 x2 \u2212 x22 .\n\n(iii ) As a third example we take the two-dimensional configuration \u03b11 = (2, 3),\n\u03b12 = (1, 2), \u03b13 = (0, 0), \u03b14 = (2, 1), and \u03b15 = (3, 2). In this case one can choose\nthe Gale transform to be\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 \u22121\n\uf8ec\u22121 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nB=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 \u22122 \uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed 1 3 \uf8f8\n\u22121 \u22122\n\u22121\nThe corresponding inhomogeneous coordinates are this time x1 = a1 a\u22121\n2 a4 a5 and\n\u22121 2 \u22122 3 \u22122\nx2 = a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 , and the A-discriminant takes the form\n7\nDA (a) = a1 a32 a43 a\u22123\n4 a5 DB (x) ,\n\nwith the reduced A-discriminant DB given by\nDB (x) = 1024x2 \u2212 1280x1 x2 \u2212 3125x31 + 40x21 x2 + 432x1 x22 + 40x31 x2\n\u2212 864x21 x22 \u2212 1280x41 x2 + 432x31 x22 + 1024x51 x2 .\n\nThe aim of this article is to describe the so-called coamoeba A0B of an arbitrary\nreduced A-discriminantal curve DB (x1 , x2 ) = 0. Let us therefore first define what\nis meant by the coamoeba of a general algebraic variety in the complex torus Cn\u2217 .\nDefinition 1. Let Z \u2282 Cn\u2217 be an algebraic variety. The coamoeba A0Z of Z is\ndefined to be the subset of the real torus Tn = (R/2\u03c0Z)n given by A0Z = Arg(Z),\nwhere Arg denotes the mapping\n\u0001\n(x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) 7\u2192 arg(x1 ), arg(x2 ), . . . , arg(xn ) .\n\n\f4\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nRemark. The coamoeba was originally introduced as a kind of dual object of\nthe amoeba AZ of Z,\u0001 which is analogously defined as AZ = Log(Z), with Log(x) =\nlog |x1 |, . . . , log |xn | . Some authors use the synonymous term alga instead of\ncoamoeba. It is useful to think of the coamoeba also as \"lifted\" to the covering\nspace Rn , thus regarding the argument mapping as being multivalued.\nA very efficient way of studying the zero locus of a reduced A-discriminant is\nto make use of the so-called Horn\u2013Kapranov parametrization. In order to explain\nit, we first recall what is meant by the logarithmic Gauss mapping \u03b3 defined on the\nregular part of complex hypersurface Z \u2282 Cm\n\u2217 . In terms of a defining function f\nfor Z the logarithmic Gauss mapping is given analytically by the simple formula\nreg Z 3 x 7\u2192 \u03b3(x) = [x1 \u22021 f (x) : x2 \u22022 f (x) : . . . : xm \u2202m f (x)] \u2208 CPm\u22121 , \u2202k = \u2202/\u2202xk ,\nand it admits the following geometric interpretation. Given a point x0 \u2208 reg Z,\nchoose a local branch near x0 of the logarithmic transformation (x1 , . . . , xn ) 7\u2192\n(log x1 , . . . , log xn ). Then \u03b3(x0 ) \u2208 CPm\u22121 is equal to the complex normal direction\nof the transformed surface Z 0 at the corresponding point x00 . It was proved by\nKapranov in [6] that if the hypersurface Z is defined by a reduced A-discriminant\nDB , then the logarithmic Gauss mapping is birational, with a completely explicit\ninverse rational mapping \u03a8.\nDefinition 2. The Horn\u2013Kapranov parametrization of the discriminant hypersurface DB (x) = 0 is the rational mapping \u03a8 : CPm\u22121 \u2192 Cm\n\u2217 given by\n(2)\n\n\u03a8[t1 : t2 . . . : tm ] =\n\nN\n\u0010Y\n\nbj1\n\nhbj , ti\n\nj=1\n\n,\n\nN\nY\n\nbj2\n\nhbj , ti\n\n,...,\n\nj=1\n\nN\nY\n\n\u0011\nhbj , tibjm .\n\nj=1\n\nRemark. The most striking result in the Kapranov paper [6] is that the property of having a birational logarithmic Gauss mapping actually characterizes the\nreduced A-discriminantal hypersurfaces. The precise content of this characterization requires some clarification, and we refer to [1] for a discussion on this matter.\n\nExamples. (i ) With B given by the row vectors b1 = (\u22121, \u22121), b2 = (1, 0),\nand b3 = (0, 1), one obtains the Horn\u2013Kapranov mapping\n\u0010\nt \u0011\n1\n,\u2212\n,\n\u03a8[1 : t] = \u2212\n1+t 1+t\nand putting x1 = \u22121/(1+t), x2 = \u2212t/(1+t) one sees that it does indeed parametrize\nthe line 1 + x1 + x2 = 0.\n(ii ) Taking N = 4 and the matrix B with row vectors b1 = (1, 0), b2 = (0, 1),\nb3 = (\u22123, \u22122), and b4 = (2, 1), one constructs the parametrization\nx1 = \u2212\n\n(2 + t)2\n,\n(3 + 2t)3\n\nx2 =\n\nt(2 + t)\n(3 + 2t)2\n\nof the reduced cubic discriminant curve 27x21 + 4x1 + 4x32 \u2212 18x1 x2 \u2212 x22 = 0.\n(iii ) Our example with N = 5 is the B-matrix with row vectors b1 = (1, \u22121),\nb2 = (\u22121, 2), b3 = (0, \u22122), b4 = (1, 3), and b5 = (\u22121, \u22122). The corresponding\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n5\n\nHorn\u2013Kapranov parametrization is then\n(3)\n\nx1 = \u2212\n\n(1 \u2212 t)(1 + 3t)\n,\n(\u22121 + 2t)(1 + 2t)\n\nx2 =\n\n(\u22121 + 2t)2 (1 + 3t)3\n,\n(1 + 2t)2 (1 \u2212 t)4t2\n\nand one can verify that it does indeed satisfy DB (x1 , x2 ) = 0, where DB is the\nrather complicated reduced A-discriminant we found in case (iii ) above.\nWe have now set the stage for our investigations of the coamoebas of reduced\nA-discriminant hypersurfaces in two variables, or in other words, the coamoebas\nof plane algebraic curves of the special form DB (x1 , x2 ) = 0, with the irreducible\npolynomial DB \u2208 Z[x1 , x2 ] derived from an integer N \u00d7 2-matrix B as explained\nabove.\nLet us finish this introduction with some comments on the possible applications\nof our results on discriminant coamoebas. It was the study of the singularities of\nA-hypergeometric functions that motivated Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky to\nintroduce the A-discriminants and to produce the already classical monograph [3].\nThese A-hypergeometric functions appear as solutions to certain systems of differential equations that are naturally associated with a given point configuration A. It\nis thus not unexpected that coamoebas of A-discriminant curves should be related\nto the A-hypergeometric functions. In fact, the complement components of the\ndiscriminant coamoeba provide the exact convergence domains for certain natural\nMellin-Barnes integral representations of the corresponding A-hypergeometric functions, see [8]. Analogous results regarding discriminant amoebas and convergence\ndomains for A-hypergeometric series were obtained in [8] and [9]. Another, and\nmaybe more surprising, application of discriminant coamoebas is their appearance\nin modern theoretical physics. It turns out that exactly the type of coamoebas that\nwe study here also play a role in certain linear sigma models occurring in string\ntheory, see for instance the two-parameter models presented in Section 4.4 of [5].\nPart of this work was carried out while both authors were participating in the\nMSRI program on Tropical Geometry in the fall of 2009.\n2. Description of the coamoeba\nLet there be given an integer matrix B of size N \u00d7 2. It is assumed that no row\nvector of B is equal to (0, 0), and also that the 2 \u00d7 2-minors of B are relatively\nprime. As explained in the introduction, the row vectors of the matrix B can be seen\nas representing a Gale transform of a point configuration A = {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1N } in Zn ,\nwith n = N \u22123. In particular, the corresponding matrix A, of the form (1), satisfies\nAB = 0. Even though the configuration A is not uniquely determined by B, it can\nonly change by a Z-affine isomorphism, so the volume of the convex hull conv(A)\nis well defined. We shall denote by dB the normalized volume n!Vol(conv(A)). It\nis a positive integer.\nIn view of the Horn\u2013Kapranov parametrization (2), for the case m = 2, the\ncoamoeba A0B of the reduced A-discriminant curve DB (x1 , x2 ) = 0 can be identified\nwith the full image of the composed mapping Arg \u25e6\u03a8 : CP1 \u2192 T2 = (R/2\u03c0Z)2 ,\ngiven explicitly by\n[1 : t] 7\u2212\u2192\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\nbj1 arg(bj1 + bj2 t) ,\n\nN\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\nbj2 arg(bj1 + bj2 t) .\n\n\f6\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nThe mapping Arg \u25e6\u03a8 is generically finite, and we want to keep track of the\nnumber of preimages of various points of the torus T2 . To this end, we shall\nconsider the coamoeba A0B as a (simplicial) chain in the sense of algebraic topology.\nStrictly speaking, this means that the underlying set of the coamoeba chain, which\nwe still denote by A0B , is going to be the closure of the actual coamoeba. For\nour purposes this is not an important issue, but we briefly comment on the settheoretical boundary of the coamoeba in a remark at the end of this section.\nOur approach to the coamoeba chain A0B is to specify a particular branch of\nthe lifted mapping Arg \u25e6\u03a8 : CP1 \u2192 R2 , thus obtaining what we call the principal\ncoamoeba chain A00 \u2282 R2 , which is then mapped onto A0B by the natural projection\nR2 \u2192 T2 . We begin by describing a simplicial 1-cycle \u03930 \u2282 R2 , that is, an oriented\npolygonal curve, which will turn out to be the boundary of the principal coamoeba\nchain A00 . It will be practical for us to re-order the rows of our matrix B, if\nnecessary, so as to have row vectors bj with decreasing normal slopes \u03b2j = \u2212bj1 /bj2\nas follows:\n\u221e > \u03b21 \u2265 \u03b22 \u2265 . . . \u2265 \u03b2N \u2265 (\u2212)\u221e .\nThe 1-cycle \u03930 is going to be the sum of two cycles \u0393+ and \u0393\u2212 , which are located\nsymmetrically with respect to their common starting point p0 . This point p0 is\none of the four points (0, 0), (0, \u03c0), (\u03c0, 0), or (\u03c0, \u03c0), depending on the signs of the\ncomponents of \u03a8[1 : t] for large real values of t.\nDefinition 3. Let [\u03b2N , \u03b21 ] be the real (possibly infinite) line segment that also\ncontains the remaining points \u03b2N \u22121 , . . . , \u03b22 . The principal branch [Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 on the\nsimply connected surface CP1 \\ [\u03b2N , \u03b21 ] is defined to be the continous branch of\nArg \u25e6\u03a8 that takes one of the values (0, 0), (0, \u03c0), (\u03c0, 0), or (\u03c0, \u03c0) for real t > \u03b21 .\nThe construction of the 1-cycle \u0393+ now goes as follows: place the dilated first\nvector \u03c0b1 at the starting point p0 = [Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 (t), t > \u03b21 ; then place the next\nvector \u03c0b2 at the new point p0 + \u03c0b1 , and continue in this fashion so that the last\nvector closes the cycle at the point p0 +\u03c0b1 +\u03c0b2 +. . .+\u03c0bN = p0 . If there are some\nvectors, say bk , bk+1 , . . . , bk+` , that are parallel, then they should be replaced by\ntheir sum bk + bk+1 + . . . + bk+` during this process. This will clearly not change the\nhomology of the resulting 1-cycle \u0393+ . The cycle \u0393\u2212 is then constructed in complete\nanalogy, by starting at p0 and placing the opposite vectors \u2212\u03c0b1 , \u2212\u03c0b2 , . . . , \u2212\u03c0bN\none after another. Finally, we put \u03930 = \u0393+ + \u0393\u2212 .\nExamples. (i ) In our first example case we should re-order the vectors to get\nb1 = (0, 1), b2 = (\u22121, \u22121), and b3 = (1, 0). Then we obtain\n\u0001 \u03b21 = 0, \u03b22 = \u22121, and\n\u03b23 = \u221e. Since we have \u03a8[1 : t] = \u22121/(1 + t), \u2212t/(1 + t) with both entries being\nnegative for real t > 0, we find that the starting point p0 for the cycles \u0393\u00b1 is given\nby (\u03c0, \u03c0). The triangular shaped cycle \u0393+ is depicted on the left in Figure 1.\n(ii ) The prescribed new ordering of the vectors bk on our second example is\nb1 = (0, 1), b2 = (\u22123, \u22122), b3 = (2, 1), and b4 = (1, 0). Recalling the Horn\u2013\nKapranov mapping \u03a8 for this case, we see that it has its first component negative,\nand the second component positive, for t > 0 = \u03b21 . This time the starting point p0\nis thus given by (\u03c0, 0), as indicated in the lower center of Figure 1.\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n7\n\n(iii ) The row vectors bk from our third example turn out to already have the\ncorrect ordering, with normal slopes \u03b21 = 1, \u03b22 = 1/2, \u03b23 = 0, \u03b24 = \u22121/3, and\n\u03b25 = \u22121/2. Plugging in a real value t > 1 in the parametrization (3), we see that\nx1 becomes positive, and x2 negative. Therefore we have p0 = (0, \u03c0) in this case.\nOn the right in Figure 1 we have drawn the cycle \u0393+ for this third example.\n\nFigure 1. The vectors \u03c0bk (upper row) and the cycle \u0393+ with the\nstarting point p0 indicated (lower row) from our three cases. The\ndashed square is centered at the origin and has side length 2\u03c0.\n\nDefinition 4. The principal coamoeba chain is given by A00 = A0+ + A0\u2212 where\nA0+ and A0\u2212 denote the images (counting multiplicities) under the principal branch\nmapping [Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 of the upper and lower half planes {Im t > 0} and {Im t < 0}\nrespectively.\nRemark. Note that if we map the principal coamoeba chain A00 to the torus by\nthe canonical projection R2 \u2192 T2 we recover the full coamoeba chain A0B .\nTheorem 1. The principal coamoeba chain A00 has the boundary \u2202A00 = \u03930 . More\nprecisely, for each point p \u2208 R2 \\ \u03930 , the winding number of \u03930 with respect to\np is equal to the number of preimages of p under the principal branch mapping\n[Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 .\nProof. It will be enough to prove the second statement in the theorem, for it\nimplies the first one. We therefore fix a point p in R2 \\ \u03930 . Let us make the temporary assumption that no two vectors bk are parallel, so that the values \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2N\nare all different. We deal first with the image A0+ of the upper half plane and with\nthe corresponding cycle \u0393+ . For positive constants \u03b4 and R, with \u03b4 small and\nR large, we shall consider the oriented curve C\u03b4,R in the closed upper half plane\n{Im t \u2265 0} which starts at the point R, then runs leftwards along the real axis, with\nsmall circular indentations of radius \u03b4 centered at the points \u03b2k , to the point \u2212R,\nand finally follows the half circle of radius R back to the starting point. We denote\nby \u0393\u03b4,R the curve in R2 which is the image of C\u03b4,R under the principal branch\nmapping [Arg \u25e6 \u03a8]0 .\n\n\f8\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nWe shall now prove that, for all sufficiently small \u03b4 and sufficiently large R,\nthe point p is contained in the complement R2 \\ \u0393\u03b4,R , and the winding numbers of\nthe two curves \u0393\u03b4,R and \u0393+ with respect to p are the same. First we note that,\nsince R is assumed to be large, the curve \u0393\u03b4,R has the same starting point p0 as\nthe polygonal curve \u0393+ . Then, as the curve parameter starts moving along the real\naxis, the corresponding point on the curve \u0393\u03b4,R remains fixed until the parameter\nreaches the first indentation near the point \u03b21 . Let us parametrize this circular\nindentation arc explicitly by t(\u03b8) = \u03b21 + \u03b4ei\u03b8, 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0. We then have\n[Arg \u25e6 \u03a8]0 (t(\u03b8)) \u2212 [Arg \u25e6 \u03a8]0 (t(0)) = (b11 \u03b8, b12 \u03b8) + r\u03b4 (\u03b8) ,\nwith the remainder term equal to\n\u0015\n\u0014\nY\u0010\nY\u0010\nbk2 b12 \u03b4ei\u03b8 \u0011bk2\nbk2 b12 \u03b4ei\u03b8 \u0011bk1\n1+\n, arg0\n.\n1+\n(4)\nr\u03b4 (\u03b8) = arg0\nBk1\nBk1\nk6=1\n\nk6=1\n\nHere Bk1 = det(bk , b1 ) and arg0 denotes the principal branch of the argument that\nvanishes for positive real numbers. It is clear that r\u03b4 = O(\u03b4) and r\u03b4 (0) = r\u03b4 (\u03c0) = 0,\nso this part of \u0393\u03b4,R is a curve running very close to the first line segment in \u0393+ ,\nand having the same end points as this segment. In particular, our chosen point p\nis not on this part of the curve \u0393\u03b4,R and the argument changes along the two curve\npieces seen from p are exactly the same.\nContinuing in this manner along the curve C\u03b4,R , we may proceed similarly at all\nthe small indentations to find that the image curve \u0393\u03b4,R will closely follow along the\nconsecutive edges of the polygonal curve \u0393+ . Having thus arrived at the point \u2212R\non the curve C\u03b4,R , it just remains to follow the large half circle back to the starting\npoint R. Assume first that bN 2 = 0, so that the last singularity \u03b2N is located at\ninfinity. Parametrizing the large half circle by t(\u03b8) = \u2212Re\u2212i\u03b8 , for 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c0, we\nthen get\n[Arg \u25e6 \u03a8]0 (t(\u03b8)) \u2212 [Arg \u25e6 \u03a8]0 (t(0)) = (bN 1 \u03b8, bN 2 \u03b8) + sR (\u03b8) ,\nwith\n\u0014\n\u0015\nY\u0010\nY\u0010\nbk1 R\u22121 (1\u2212ei\u03b8 ) \u0011bk2\nbk1 R\u22121 (1\u2212ei\u03b8 ) \u0011bk1\nsR (\u03b8) = arg0\n1+\n,\narg\n1+\n.\n0\nbk2 \u2212 bk1 R\u22121\nbk2 \u2212 bk1 R\u22121\nk6=N\n\nk6=N\n\nHere we see that sR (0) = sR (\u03c0) = 0, and that sR = O(R\u22121 ) as R \u2192 \u221e. Again we\nconclude that the corresponding part of the image curve \u0393\u03b4,R follows closely along\nthe final segment of \u0393+ , thus producing an equal argument change as seen from\nthe fixed point p. If on the other hand bN 2 6= 0, then moving along the half circle\nfrom \u2212R to R just results in making a small loop at the vertex p0 , which gives no\nadditional change in arguments. Hence we have shown that the curve \u0393\u03b4,R follows\nthe curve \u0393+ arbitrarily closely, and that for any chosen point p in the complement\nof \u0393+ , the two curves both have the same winding number with respect to p.\nIn order to relate the winding number of the image curve \u0393\u03b4,R around the\npoint p to the number of preimages of p in the upper half plane, we shall consider\nthe Jacobian J of the principal branch mapping. It is not hard to prove, see for\ninstance [7], that the set of critical points for the mappings Log and Arg on a plane\nalgebraic curve is equal to the inverse image \u03b3 \u22121 (RP1 ), where \u03b3 as before denotes\nthe logarithmic Gauss mapping. Since our Horn\u2013Kapranov parametrization \u03a8 is\ninverse to \u03b3, it follows that the Jacobian J is nonvanishing at all non-real points\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n9\n\n[1 : t] \u2208 CP1 . In fact, we claim that one has J(t) < 0 for Im t > 0 and vice versa.\nTo see that the principal branch mapping [Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 is indeed orientation-reversing\nin the upper half plane, we observe that the curve C\u03b4,R is negatively oriented with\nrespect to its interior, so we just have to prove that its image \u0393\u03b4,R is instead a\npositively oriented boundary. This will follow if we show that the image of a point\nt keeps to the left of the polygonal curve \u0393+ as t moves along C\u03b4,R . For this it\nsuffices to show that det(b1 , r\u03b4 (\u03b8)) > 0 for all 0 < \u03b8 < \u03c0, with r\u03b4 from (4). Some\nstraightforward computations now firstly show that\n\u0015\n\u0014X\nbk1 bk2 b12 \u03b4 sin \u03b8 X b2k2 b12 \u03b4 sin \u03b8\n,\n+ O(\u03b4 2 ) ,\nr\u03b4 (\u03b8) =\nBk1\nBk1\nk>1\n\nk>1\n\nand secondly that the determinant det(b1 , r\u03b4 (\u03b8)) therefore equals b212 \u03b4 sin \u03b8 + O(\u03b4 2 ).\nSince \u03b4 is small and b12 6= 0, this proves our claim. Observing that the Jacobian J\nis an odd function with respect to Im t, we also see that J(t) > 0 for Im t < 0.\nThe fact that J is non-zero with constant sign in the upper half plane allows us\nto count preimages of p as desired. Indeed, we continuously shrink the curve C\u03b4,R\nslightly, without letting its image curve hit the point p, so the new curve bounds\na compact region in the open upper half plane. Then we subdivide this region\ninto finitely many small patches on which our mapping is bijective. The negatively\noriented boundaries of these patches then get mapped to positively oriented closed\ncurves in R2 having winding numbers zero or one with respect to the point p,\naccording to whether p belongs to the image or not. This shows that the winding\nnumber of \u0393+ around p indeed coincides with the number of preimages of p in the\nupper half plane, and that we have \u2202A0+ = \u0393+ . To study the image A0\u2212 of the lower\nhalf plane we argue analogously, using instead the curve obtained by reflecting C\u03b4,R\nin the real axis. Notice that this new curve is positively oriented with respect to its\ninterior. Since J > 0 in the lower half plane, this means that \u0393\u2212 is also positively\noriented with respect to A0\u2212 .\nIn the above arguments we had made the assumption that there were no parallel\nvectors among the rows bj . If there are some vectors, say bk , bk+1 , . . . , bk+` , that\nare parallel, then the arguments just need a very slight modification. The starting\npoint p0 of the cycle \u0393+ will still coincide with the image of the starting point R\nof the contour C\u03b4,R , but as we follow the \u03b4-indentation at the singularity \u03b2k , which\nnow coincides with \u03b2k+1 = . . . = \u03b2k+` , the image curve will run along the edge of\n\u0393+ corresponding to the summed vector bk + bk+1 + . . . + bk+` . This means that\nthe image curve \u0393\u03b4,R will be istotopic to \u0393+ in R2 \\ {p} just as before.\n\u0003\nRemark. With Theorem 1 we have obtained a precise description of the principal coamoeba chain A00 including information about multiply covered points. But\nwhat about the actual set-theoretic coamoeba? It differs from the (closed) underlying set of the coamoeba chain in that it does not contain all its boundary points.\nIn fact, it should have become clear from the proof of Theorem 1 that the real\nintervals of RP1 \\ {\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2N } get mapped to the vertices of the polygonal curve\n\u03930 = \u0393+ + \u0393\u2212 . (See the examples in Figure 2, where these vertices are clearly\nmarked.) The edges of \u03930 however, are not attained in the image of the principal\nbranch mapping [Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 , for they correspond to the singular points \u03b2k . This\nmeans that, set-theoretically, the principal coamoeba is equal to the interior of the\nunderlying set of the coamoeba chain, but with the vertices of \u03930 added to it.\n\n\f10\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nFigure 2. The principal coamoeba chains A00 for the running examples. Observe the darker doubly covered areas in the third case.\n\n3. Associated zonotopes and area formulas\nHaving obtained a clear picture of the principal coamoeba chain A00 \u2282 R2 , whose\nimage under the canonical projection to the torus T2 is equal to the true coamoeba\nchain A0B , we now introduce another, much simpler polygonal chain \u03a00 , which is\nalso defined in terms of the given matrix B. In fact, \u03a00 is nothing but the closed\nconvex polygon obtained as the Minkowski sum\n\u03a00 = S1 + S2 + . . . + SN\n\b\nof the line segments Sk = conv (0, 0), \u03c0bk , where the bk as before denote the\nrow vectors of B. Being a Minkowski sum of line segments, the polygon \u03a00 is by\ndefinition a so-called zonotope. As all zonotopes it is symmetric with respect to its\ncenter, and the fact that the vectors bk sum to zero implies that the center of \u03a00\nis located at the origin. The positively oriented boundary of \u03a0B can be obtained\nby placing the vectors \u00b1\u03c0bk cyclically after one another in counterclockwise order.\n\nFigure 3. The zonotopes \u03a00 for our three running examples.\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n11\n\nA dual representation of the zonotope \u03a00 in terms of linear inequalities is given by\nN\nn\no\n\u03c0X\n\u03a00 = \u03b8 \u2208 R2 ; h\u03b8, \u03bei \u2264\nhbk , \u03bei , for all \u03be \u2208 R2 .\n2\nk=1\n\nObserve that there are in fact only finitely many inequalities involved here, one for\neach normal direction \u03be = (bk2 , \u2212bk1 ).\nOur next objective is to compute the area both of the zonotope \u03a00 and of the\nprincipal coamoeba chain A00 . The area of \u03a00 poses no problem, because there is\na well known formula for the volume of a general zonotope, see for instance [10],\nwhich in our setting takes the form\nX\n(5)\nArea (\u03a00 ) = \u03c0 2\n| det(bj , bk )| .\nj<k\n\nSince we are taking absolute values in the above sum, the ordering of the vectors\nis immaterial here.\nWe then want to derive a similar formula for the area of the principal coamoeba\nchain A00 . As we have seen, the principal coamoeba can overlap itself, so we really\nshould take the multiplicities into account when we calculate its area. Let us define\nprecisely what we mean by the area of a (simplicial) chain.\nP\nP\nDefinition 5. The area of a simplicial 2-chain j\u2208J mj \u03c3j is defined to be j\u2208J mj Area (\u03c3j ),\nwhere mj is the multiplicity of the component \u03c3j .\nThis definition allows also for negative multiplicities, and such negatively signed\nareas will actually appear in our proof of the following result. Recall that we have\nordered the row vectors bj of the matrix B in a clockwise projective manner, that\nis, so that the slope of each vector is smaller than that of the preceding one.\nProposition 1. Let the vectors bj be ordered clockwise projectively. The area of\nthe principal coamoeba chain is then given by\nX\n(6)\nArea (A00 ) = \u03c0 2\ndet(bj , bk ) .\nj<k\n\nProof. Given any vectors v1 , v2 , . . . , vr in R2 , we introduce the notation\n[v1 , v2 , . . . , vr ] for the oriented polygonal curve obtained by placing the vectors\none after another, starting by putting v1 at the origin. In this notation we have\n\u0393\u00b1 = p0 \u00b1 [\u03c0b1 , \u03c0b2 , . . . , \u03c0bN ] ,\nexcept that if there are some parallel vectors with opposite signs among the bj ,\nwe get on the right hand side some harmless extra edges that are traced in both\ndirections. Making a translation and re-scaling by 1/\u03c0, we thus see that the area\nof the principal coamoeba chain A00 that we wish to find, is equal to 2\u03c0 2 times the\narea of the chain bounded by the 1-cycle [b1 , b2 , . . . , bN ]. We shall now compute\nthis area by summing the signed area of certain oriented triangles.\nLet us write b\u0302j for the vector bj + bj+1 + . . . + bN , and consider the 1-cycle\n[\u2212b\u03022 , b2 , b\u03023 , \u2212b\u03023 , b3 , b\u03024 , \u2212b\u03024 , b4 , b\u03025 , . . . , \u2212b\u0302N \u22121 , bN \u22121 , b\u0302N ] .\nSince b1 = \u2212b\u03022 and bN = b\u0302N , we see that this new cycle is just the extension of the\ncycle [b1 , b2 , . . . , bN ] obtained by inserting the two extra edges b\u0302k and \u2212b\u0302k between\nthe original edges bk\u22121 and bk , for k = 3, . . . , N \u2212 1.\n\n\f12\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nObviously, the winding number with respect to each point in the complement\nof this curve is the same as for the original cycle [b1 , b2 , . . . , bN ]. Notice that each\ntriplet [\u2212b\u0302k , bk , b\u0302k+1 ] can be written [b1 + . . . + bk\u22121 , bk , bk+1 + . . . + bN ], and since\nthe total sum b1 + b2 + . . . + bN is equal to zero, the triplet is a cycle that bounds an\noriented triangle Tk . The signed area of such a triangle Tk is given by det(\u2212b\u0302k , bk )/2,\nand we conclude that\nArea (A00 )\n\n= 2\u03c0\n\n2\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nArea (Tk ) = \u03c0\n\nk=2\n\n2\n\nN\nX\n\ndet(b1 + . . . + bk\u22121 , bk ) = \u03c0 2\n\nk=2\n\nX\n\ndet(bj , bk ),\n\nj<k\n\nwhere we have used the fact that det(b1 + . . . + bN \u22121 , bN ) = det(\u2212bN , bN ) = 0, and\nthe last equality follows from the bilinearity of the determinant.\nP\nNotice also that the expression j<k det(bj , bk ) is invariant under cyclic permutations. Indeed, it is enough to check that the sum does not change if we take\nthe vectors in the new order bN , b1 , b2 , . . . , bN \u22121 , and then it is only the contribution from determinants containing bN that matters. But this contribution is zero\nfor both the original and the new ordering, since we have\n\u2212\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\nj=1\n\ndet(bN , bj ) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\ndet(bj , bN ) = det(b1 + . . . + bN , bN ) = det(0, bN ) = 0 .\n\nj=1\n\n\u0003\n\n4. The coamoeba and its complement\nWe are going to project both the principal coamoeba chain A00 and the zonotope\n\u03a00 to the torus T2 = (R/2\u03c0Z)2 by means of the canonical projection R2 \u2192 T2 .\nThe image of A00 will be the coamoeba chain A0B , which is our main object of study,\nand the image of \u03a00 will be an easily described chain that we denote by \u03a0B .\nBefore actually performing the projection, let us first determine the mutual\nlocation of the principal coamoeba A00 and the zonotope \u03a00 . We have already\nlocated the common starting point p0 for the two boundary cycles \u0393\u00b1 of A00 . Let\nus now also fix a starting point q0 on the boundary of the zonotope \u03a00 . We let\nthis q0 be the \"southwesternmost\" vertex of \u03a00 , that is, the sum of all vectors \u03c0bj\nwith strictly negative second coordinate plus the sum of those \u03c0bj that have zero\nsecond coordinate and negative first coordinate. The following simple result shows\nthat the points p0 and q0 get projected to the same point on the torus T2 .\nLemma. Let p0 and q0 denote the initial vertices of A00 and \u03a00 as explained\nabove. Then one has p0 \u2261 q0 \u2261 \u2212q0 (mod 2\u03c0Z2 ).\nProof. Notice first that, since q0 is a point in the denser lattice \u03c0Z2 , it is clear\nthat the difference q0 \u2212 (\u2212q0 ) = 2q0 belongs to 2\u03c0Z2 , and hence that q0 \u2261 \u2212q0 .\nNow, from the way in which the vertex q0 was chosen, it follows that its coordinates\nare given by\nX\nX\nX\nq01 = \u03c0\nbj1 + \u03c0\nbj1 and q02 = \u03c0\nbj2 .\nbj2 <0\n\nbj2 =0\nbj1 <0\n\nbj2 <0\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n13\n\nThe vertex p0 on the other hand, was defined as the value of the principal branch\nmapping [Arg \u25e6\u03a8]0 at a large positive value of t. Recalling the form (2) of the\nHorn\u2013Kapranov mapping \u03a8, we see that, modulo the lattice 2\u03c0Z2 , the coordinates\nof p0 are given by\nY b \u0001\nY b\nY b \u0001\nbj1j1\np01 = arg\nbj2j1 \u00d7\nand p02 = arg\nbj2j2 .\nbj2 <0\n\nbj2 =0\nbj1 <0\n\nbj2 <0\n\nSince the argument of a negative number is equal to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0, we see that\nthe above coordinate expressions for q0 and p0 do indeed coincide modulo the\nlattice.\n\u0003\nConsider now the natural projection R2 \u2192 T2 , and the images A0B and \u03a0B of\nthe chains A00 and \u03a00 respectively. Let us also introduce the notation\ndet+ (bj , bk ) = max{det(bj , bk ), 0)}.\n\nFigure 4. The coamoeba chains A0B for our recurring examples\ndrawn in the torus T2. The lightly shaded regions are covered once\nand the darker areas are doubly covered.\nOur next result reveals a close complementary relationship between the coamoeba\nand the zonotope.\nTheorem 2. The summed chain A0B + \u03a0B is a cycle, and hence equal to mB T2 ,\nwith some integer multiplicity mB . In fact, provided that the vectors bk are ordered\nclockwise projectively, this multiplicity is given by the formula\n1X\nmB =\ndet+ (bj , bk ) .\n2\nj<k\n\nProof. In order to prove that A0B + \u03a0B is a cycle we are going to show that\nthe oriented boundary segments of A00 and \u03a00 cancel each other out pairwise when\nmapped to the torus. From the above lemma we know that the starting points\np0 and \u00b1q0 get projected onto the same point in the torus. Let us now follow\nthe respective boundary cycles segment by segment, and verify that there is a\ncancellation as claimed.\nTo begin with, we treat the case with no parallel vectors among the bk . The\nboundary cycle \u03930 then has an oriented edge given by the vector \u03c0b1 going from\nthe vertex p0 to the neighboring vertex p0 + \u03c0b1 , and another oriented edge given\nby the vector \u2212\u03c0b1 going from p0 to p0 \u2212 \u03c0b1 . On the zonotope on the other hand,\nwe have an oriented boundary edge given by one of the two vectors \u00b1\u03c0b1 but now\n\n\f14\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\narriving at the vertex q0 from the neighboring vertex q0 \u2213\u03c0b1 , and another oriented\nedge given by the opposite vector \u2213\u03c0b1 arriving at \u2212q0 from \u2212q0 \u00b1 \u03c0b1 . From this\ndescription it is clear that each of the two coamoeba edges, when mapped to the\ntorus, exactly coincides with one reversely oriented edge from the zonotope.\nNow we note that the four neighboring vertices p0 \u00b1 \u03c0b1 and \u00b1(q0 \u00b1 \u03c0b1 )\nmentioned above are again mapped to one single point on the torus, so we can repeat\nthe same reasoning, starting at these points and cancelling oriented edges given by\n\u00b1\u03c0b2 . Continuing in the same manner we thus establish that the boundaries of the\nprojected chains A0B and \u03a0B indeed sum up to zero.\nIn the presence of parallel vectors, the argument needs to be adapted somewhat.\nSuppose for instance that the vectors bk , bk+1 , . . . , bk+` are parallel, but the next\nvector bk+`+1 has a different slope. This implies that we can write bk+j = rj bk ,\nfor some rational numbers rj . Let us introduce the notation b0k for the summed\nvector bk + bk+1 + . . . + bk+` = (1 + r1 + . . . + r` )bk , and b00k for the possibly longer\nvector (1 + |r1 | + . . . + |r` |)bk . As before there will be four vertex points, two on the\ncoamoeba and two on the zonotope, that all correspond to the same torus point,\nbut this time with the property that the two coamoeba vertices have the vectors \u03c0b0k\nand \u2212\u03c0b0k as oriented edges emanating from them, while the two zonotope vertices\nhave the vectors \u03c0b00k and \u2212\u03c0b00k terminating at them.\nUnless all the parallel vectors bk , bk+1 , . . . , bk+` have the same direction, so\nthat all the rj are positive, the edges of the coamoeba and the reversely oriented,\nbut longer, edges of the zonotope will no more cancel each other out completely.\nHowever, the two remaining edge pieces from the zonotope boundary will be of the\nform \u00b1\u03c0(b00k \u2212 b0k ) = \u00b12\u03c0(r1+ + . . . + r`+ )bk , where rj+ = max(rj , 0), and this means\nthat on the torus they both represent the same closed curve, but with opposite\norientations. They therefore cancel each other out, and again we conclude that the\nboundary of A0B + \u03a0B vanishes.\nNow, the only 2-cycles on the torus T2 are integral multiples of T2 itself, and\nsince our chains are positively oriented we must therefore have A0B + \u03a0B = mB T2 ,\nfor some positive integer mB . In order to find this multiplicity mB we note that\nthe area (with multiplicities) is preserved under the projection R2 \u2192 (R/2\u03c0Z)2 .\nThis means that we can compute mB as the area of A0B + \u03a0B divided by the area\n4\u03c0 2 of the torus. Using the area formulas (5) and (6) for the zonotope \u03a00 and for\nthe principal coamoeba chain A00 respectively, we obtain\nX\nX\n1X\nmB = [\u03c0 2\ndet(bj , bk ) + \u03c0 2\n| det(bj , bk )|]/4\u03c0 2 =\ndet+ (bj , bk ) .\n2\nj<k\n\nj<k\n\nj<k\n\n\u0003\nExamples. (i ) In our first example case the appropriately re-ordered vectors\nare b1 = (0, 1), b2 = (\u22121, \u22121), and b3 = (1, 0), and hence the area computations\nbecome\n0 1\n0 1\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u03c0 \u22122 Area (A0B ) =\n+\n+\n= 1 \u2212 1 + 1 = 1;\n\u22121 \u22121\n1 0\n1 0\n\u03c0 \u22122 Area (\u03a0B ) =\n\n0 1\n\u22121 \u22121\n\n+\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n0\n\n+\n\n\u22121 \u22121\n1 0\n\n= 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n\n\fDISCRIMINANT COAMOEBAS IN DIMENSION TWO\n\n15\n\nWe see in Figures 3 and 4 that the combined chain A0B + \u03a0B precisely covers\nthe torus T2 , so that in this case mB = 1, which agrees with the formula from\nTheorem 2:\n\u0001\n1X\n1\nmB =\ndet+ (bj , bk ) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 1 .\n2\n2\nj<k\n\n(ii ) The second example consists of the vectors b1 = (0, 1), b2 = (\u22123, \u22122),\nb3 = (2, 1), and b4 = (1, 0). This time we obtain the areas\n\u03c0 \u22122 Area (A0B ) =\n\n0\n0 1\n+\n2\n\u22123 \u22122\n\n0\n1\n+\n1\n1\n\n2\n\u22123 \u22122\n\u22123 \u22122\n1\n+\n+\n+\n1\n1 0\n2 1\n0\n\n1\n=\n0\n\n= 3 \u2212 2 \u2212 1 + 1 + 2 \u2212 1 = 2;\n\u03c0 \u22122 Area (\u03a0B ) = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 10 .\nThe area of A0B + \u03a0B is thus equal to 12\u03c0 2 and dividing by the area of the torus\nT2 , we get the multiplicity mB = 12\u03c0 2 /4\u03c0 2 = 3.\n(iii ) In our third and final case we have b1 = (1, \u22121), b2 = (\u22121, 2), b3 = (0, \u22122),\nb4 = (1, 3), and b5 = (\u22121, \u22122).

Significance of the multiplicity\nWe shall now relate the multiplicity mB of the summed chain A0B + \u03a0B to the\noriginal point configuration A \u2282 Zn , n = N \u2212 3, from which the matrix B was\nobtained as a Gale dual.\nTheorem 3. The multiplicity mB from Theorem 2 satisfies\nmB = dB ,\nwhere dB is the normalized volume n! Vol(conv(A)) of the convex hull of the point\nconfiguration A \u2282 Zn .\nProof. Remember that we have ordered the vectors bk according to decreasing\nslope, with the normal of b1 having the largest finite slope. Let L be an almost\nhorizontal line through the origin in R2 with slope \u2212\u03b5, so that its normal slope \u03b5\u22121\nis larger than \u03b21 = \u2212b11 /b12 . Also let L+ and L\u2212 denote the two rays L \u2229 {x \u2265 0}\nand L \u2229 {x \u2264 0} respectively. By Gale duality, see for instance [2], one knows that\nX\nX\ndB =\n| det(bj , bk )| =\n| det(bj , bk )| ,\nCone(bj ,bk )\u2283L+\n\nCone(bj ,bk )\u2283L\u2212\n\n\f16\n\nLISA NILSSON & MIKAEL PASSARE\n\nwhere the summation is over all pairs j < k such that the convex cone spanned by\nthe two vectors bj and bk contains the ray L+ or L\u2212 . In order to prove the theorem\nit will therefore suffice to show that\nX\nX\nX\n(7)\ndet+ (bj , bk ) =\n| det(bj , bk )| +\n| det(bj , bk )| .\nj<k\n\nCone(bj ,bk )\u2283L\u2212\n\nCone(bj ,bk )\u2283L+\n\nNotice first that if bj and bk lie on the same side of L, then because of the\nspecial clockwise ordering, the determinant det(bj , bk ) is negative (or zero), and\nthe cone Cone(bj , bk ) does not contain either of the rays L+ or L\u2212 . Such pairs j, k\ntherefore give zero contribution to both sides of (7). Suppose next that bj is below\nL and bk is above L. Then, since j < k, the positive angle from bj to bk is \u2264 \u03c0\nso the determinant is \u2265 0, and unless the two vectors are parallel, the convex cone\nCone(bj , bk ) contains the ray L+ . We thus get the same contribution | det(bj , bk )|\nto both sides of (7). The remaining case is similar.\n\u0003\nExamples.

Recall that associated to the configuration A there is the toric variety\nXA = {(z \u03b11 : z \u03b12 : . . . : z \u03b1N ) ; z \u2208 Cn\u2217 } \u2282 CPN \u22121 .\nIt follows from Kouchnirenko's theorem that dB also equals the degree of XA , see\nfor instance [3].
