Commutative algebra and rational homotopy theory\nReferences\n\nIntroduction\nThis overview of rational homotopy theory consists of an extended version of\nlecture notes from a minicourse based primarily on the encyclopedic text [18] of\nF\u00e9lix, Halperin and Thomas. With only three hours to devote to such a broad\nand rich subject, it was difficult to choose among the numerous possible topics to\npresent. Based on the subjects covered in the first week of this summer school,\nI decided that the goal of this course should be to establish carefully the foundations of rational homotopy theory, then to treat more superficially one of its most\nimportant tools, the Sullivan model. Finally, I provided a brief summary of the extremely fruitful interactions between rational homotopy theory and local algebra,\nin the spirit of the summer school theme \"Interactions between Homotopy Theory\nand Algebra.\" I hoped to motivate the students to delve more deeply into the\nsubject themselves, while providing them with a solid enough background to do so\nwith relative ease.\nAs these lecture notes do not constitute a history of rational homotopy theory,\nI have chosen to refer the reader to [18], instead of to the original papers, for the\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 55P60.\nWork completed during a visit to the Institut Mittag-Leffler (Djursholm, Sweden).\nc 0000 (copyright holder)\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nKATHRYN HESS\n\nproofs of almost all of the results cited, at least in Sections 1 and 2. The reader\ninterested in proper attributions will find them in [18] or [24].\nThe author would like to thank Chris Allday, Luchezar Avramov, Srikanth\nIyengar, Mike Mandell and Jonathan Scott, as well as the anonymous referee, for\ntheir helpful comments on an earlier version of this article.\nBasic notation and terminology. We assume in this chapter that the reader\nis familiar with the elements of the theories of simplicial sets and of model categories.\nAs references we recommend [13] or [25] or the chapter of these lecture notes by\nPaul Goerss [20].\nIn this chapter, sSet and Top are the categories of simplicial sets and of topological spaces, respectively. Furthermore, | * | : sSet \u2192 Top denotes the geometric\nrealization functor, while S\u2022 : Top \u2192 sSet denotes its right adjoint, the singular\nsimplices functor.\nIf K is a simplicial set, then C\u2217 (K) and C \u2217 (K) denote its normalized chain\nand cochain complexes, respectively. If X is a topological\nspace, then the singular\n\u0001\n\u0001\nchains and cochains on X are S\u2217 (X) := C\u2217 S\u2022 (X) and S \u2217 (X) := C \u2217 S\u2022 (X) .\nA morphism of (co)chain complexes inducing an isomorphism in (co)homology\n\u2243\nis called a quasi-isomorphim and denoted \u2212\n\u2192.\nA graded vector space is said to be of finite type if it is finite dimensional in\neach degree. A CW-complex is of finite type if it has finite number of cells in each\ndimension.\nGiven a category C and two objects A and B in C, we write C(A, B) for the\nclass of morphisms with source A and target B.\n1. Foundations\nFor the sake of simplicity, we work throughout these notes only with simply\nconnected spaces. Many of the results presented hold for connected, nilpotent\nspaces as well.\ne \u2217 denote re1.1. Rationalization and rational homotopy type. Let H\nduced homology.\nDefinition 1.1. A simply connected space X is rational if the following, equivalent conditions are satisfied.\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n\u03c0\u2217 X is a Q-vector space.\ne \u2217 (X; Z) is a Q-vector space.\nH\ne \u2217 (\u03a9X; Z) is a Q-vector space.\nH\n\nTo prove the equivalence of these conditions, one begins by observing that\nH\u2217 (K(Q, 1); Fp ) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (pt.; Fp ) for all primes p. An inductive Serre spectral sequence\nargument then shows that H\u2217 (K(Q, n); Fp ) \u223c\n= H\u2217 (pt.; Fp ) for all primes p and all\nn \u2265 1. The equivalence of conditions (1) and (2) for an arbitrary X then follows\nfrom an inductive argument on the Postnikov tower of X. On the other hand, the\nequivalence between conditions (2) and (3) can be easily verified by a Serre spectral\nsequence argument.\nExample 1.2. For any n \u2265 2, W\nlet \u03b9n,k denote the homotopy class of the inclusion\nof S n as the k th summand Skn of k\u22651 Skn .

Furthermore, the homomorphism induced in reduced\nhomology by the inclusion X(r) \u0592\u2192 X(r + 1) is multiplication by r + 1.

A pair of spaces (X, A) is a relative CW0 -complex if X =\nn\u22651 X(n), where\n(1) X(1) = A;\n(2) for all n \u2265 1, there is a pushout\n`\n\nn\n\u03b1\u2208Jn (S )0\n\n`\n\n\u03b1\n\nf\u03b1\n\n// X(n)\n\nincl.\n\n\u000f\u000f\nn+1\n(D\n)0\n\u03b1\u2208Jn\n\n`\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// X(n + 1);\n\n(3) X has the weak topology, i.e., U \u2282 X is open in X if and only if U \u2229 X(n)\nis open in X(n) for all n.\n\u0001\n\u0001\nThe pairs (S n )0 , S n and (Dn+1 )0 , Dn+1 are the fundamental examples of\nrelative CW0 -complexes.\nNote that if A is a rational space and (X, A) is a relative CW0 -complex, then\nX is rational as well.\nDefinition 1.4. Let X be a simply connected space. A continuous map l :\nX \u2192 Y is a rationalization of X if Y is simply connected and rational and\n\u03c0\u2217 l \u2297 Q : \u03c0\u2217 X \u2297 Q \u2212\u2192 \u03c0\u2217 Y \u2297 Q \u223c\n= \u03c0\u2217 Y\nis an isomorphism.\nObserve that a map l : X \u2192 Y of simply connected spaces is a rationalization\nif and only if H\u2217 (l; Q) is an isomorphism and Y is rational.\nThe inclusions of S n into (S n )0 and of Dn+1 into (Dn+1 )0 are rationalizations.\nThe rationalization of an arbitrary simply connected space, as constructed in the\nnext theorem, generalizes these fundamental examples.\n\n\f4\n\nKATHRYN HESS\n\nTheorem 1.5. Let X be a simply connected space. There exists a relative\nCW-complex (X0 , X) with no zero-cells and no one-cells such that the inclusion\nj : X \u2192 X0 is a rationalization. Furthermore, if Y is a simply connected, rational\nspace, then any continuous map f : X \u2192 Y can be extended over X0 , i.e., there is\na continuous map g : X0 \u2192 Y , which is unique up to homotopy, such that\nXB\nBB\nBB\nB\nj BB\n\nf\n\nX0\n\n// Y\n}>>\n}\n}}\n}} g\n}}\n\ncommutes.\nProof. We provide only a brief sketch of the proof. We can restrict to the\ncase where X is a 1-reduced CW-complex. The rationalization X0 can then be\nconstructed as a CW0 -complex with rational n-cells in bijection with the n-cells of\nX, for all n. The attaching maps of X0 are obtained by rationalizing the attaching\nmaps of X. The complete proof can be found in [18, Theorem 9.7].\n\u0003\nContinuing in the same vein, one can show that such a cellular rationalization\nis unique up to homotopy equivalence, relative to X.\nGiven a continous map \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y between simply connected spaces, we let\n\u03c60 : X0 \u2192 Y0 denote the induced map between their rationalizations, the existence\nand uniqueness (up to homotopy) of which are guaranteed by Theorem 1.5.\nDefinition 1.6. The rational homotopy type of a simply connected space X\nis the weak homotopy type of its rationalization X0 .\nDefinition 1.7. A continuous map \u03c6 : X \u2192 Y between simply connected\nspaces is a rational homotopy equivalence if the following, equivalent conditions are\nsatisfied.\n(1) \u03c0\u2217 (\u03c6) \u2297 Q is an isomorphism.\n(2) H\u2217 (\u03c6; Q) is an isomorphism.\n(3) H\u2217 (\u03c6; Q) is an isomorphism.\n(4) \u03c60 : X0 \u2192 Y0 is a weak homotopy equivalence.\nTo simplify computations, it is common in rational homotopy theory to restrict\nto the class of spaces defined by the following proposition, the proof of which is in\n[18, Theorem 9.11].\nProposition 1.8. For any simply connected space X, there is a CW-complex\nZ and a rational homotopy equivalence \u03c6 : Z \u2192 X such that\n(1) H\u2217 (X; Q) is of finite type if and only if Z is of finite type; and\n(2) if dimQ H\u2217 (X; Q) < \u221e, then H\u2217 (X; Q) = H\u2264N (X; Q) if and only if Z is\na finite CW-complex of dimension at most N .\nDefinition 1.9. A simply connected space X is of finite rational type if condition (1) of Proposition 1.8 is satisfied.\nWe can now finally specify clearly the subject presented in these notes.\nRational homotopy theory is the study of rational homotopy types of spaces and of the properties of spaces\nand maps that are invariant under rational homotopy\nequivalence.\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n5\n\nFor further information on rationalization, the reader is refered to Section 9 of\n[18].\n1.2. The passage to commutative cochain algebras. We show in this\nsection that the category of rational homotopy types of simply connected, finite-type\nspaces and of homotopy classes of maps between their representatives is equivalent\nto an appropriately defined homotopy category of commutative differential graded\nalgebras over Q.\nThe algebraic category and its homotopy structure. We begin by a rather careful\nintroduction to the algebraic category in which the Sullivan model of a topological\nspace lives.\nA commutative differential graded algebra (CDGA) over Q is a commutative\nmonoid in the category of non-negatively graded, rational cochain complexes (cf.,\n[20]). In other words, a CDGA is a cochain complex (A\u2217 , d) over Q, endowed with\ncochain maps\n\u03b7 : Q \u2212\u2192 (A\u2217 , d),\ncalled the unit, and\n\u03bc : (A\u2217 , d) \u2297Q (A\u2217 , d) \u2212\u2192 (A\u2217 , d) : a \u2297 b 7\u2192 a * b,\ncalled the product, such that\n(1) \u03bc is graded commutative, i.e., if a \u2208 Ap and b \u2208 Aq , then a*b = (\u22121)pq b*a;\n(2) \u03bc is associative; and\n(3) \u03bc(\u03b7 \u2297 IdA ) = IdA = \u03bc(IdA \u2297 \u03b7).\nObserve that since \u03bc is a morphism of chain complexes, the differential on a CDGA\nsatisfies the Leibniz rule, i.e., if a \u2208 Ap and b \u2208 Aq , then\nd(a * b) = da * b + (\u22121)p a * db.\nLet r \u2208 N. A CDGA A is r-connected if A0 = Q and Ak = 0 for all 0 < k < r+1.\n \u0304 \u03bc\u0304, \u03b7\u0304) is a cochain map such\nA morphism of CDGA's f : (A\u2217 , d, \u03bc, \u03b7) \u2192 (\u0100\u2217 , d,\nthat f \u03bc = \u03bc\u0304(f \u2297 f ) and f \u03b7 = \u03b7\u0304. The category of CDGA's over Q and their\nmorphims is denoted CDGAQ .\nTo simplify notation, we frequently write either A or (A, d) to denote (A\u2217 , d, \u03bc, \u03b7).\nFurthermore, henceforth in these notes, the notation \u2297 means \u2297Q .\nIn rational homotopy theory, CDGA's with free underlying commutative, graded\nalgebra play an essential role. Given a non-negatively graded vector space V =\n\u2295i\u22650 V i , let \u039bV denote the free, commutative, graded algebra generated by V , i.e.,\n\u039bV = S[V even ] \u2297 E[V odd ],\nthe tensor product of the symmetric algebra on the vectors of even degree and of\nthe exterior algebra on the vectors of odd degree. Given a basis {vj | j \u2208 J} of V ,\nwe often write \u039b(vj )j\u2208J for \u039bV . We also write \u039bn V to denote the set of elements\nof \u039bV of wordlength n.\nA homomorphism of commutative, graded algebras \u03c6 : \u039bV \u2192 A is determined\nby its restriction to V , as is any derivation of commutative, graded algebras \u03b4 :\n\u039bV \u2192 A. In particular, the differential d of a CDGA (\u039bV, d) is determined by its\nrestriction to V .\nMore generally, the following class of CDGA morphisms is particularly important in rational homotopy theory.\n\n\f6\n\nKATHRYN HESS\n\nDefinition 1.10. A relative Sullivan algebra consists of an inclusion of CDGA's\n(A, d) \u2192 (A\u2297\u039bV, d) such that V has a basis {v\u03b1 | \u03b1 \u2208 J}, where J is a well-ordered\nset, such that dv\u03b2 \u2208 A \u2297 \u039bV<\u03b2 for all \u03b2 \u2208 J, where V\u03b2 is the span of {v\u03b1 | \u03b1 < \u03b2}.\nA relative Sullivan algebra is minimal if\n\u03b1 < \u03b2 =\u21d2 deg v\u03b1 \u2264 deg v\u03b2 .\nA (minimal) relative Sullivan algebra (\u039bV, d) extending (A, d) = (Q, 0) is called a\n(minimal) Sullivan algebra.\nRemark 1.11. If V 0 = 0 = V 1 , then (\u039bV, d) is always a Sullivan algebra and\nis minimal if and only if dV \u2282 \u039b\u22652 V , the subspace of words of length at least two.\nExample 1.12. The CDGA (\u039b(x, y, z), d), where x, y and z are all of degree 1\nand dx = yz, dy = zx and dz = yx, is an example of a CDGA with free underlying\ngraded algebra that is not a Sullivan algebra.\nRecall from Example 1.7 and (a slight modification of) Example 3.4(1) in [20]\nthat the category Ch\u2217 (Q) of non-negatively graded cochain complexes over Q admits a cofibrantly generated model category structure in which\n(1) weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms;\n(2) fibrations are degreewise surjections; and\n(3) cofibrations are degreewise injections, in positive degrees.\nThe set of generating acyclic cofibrations is\nJ = {jn : 0 \u2192 D(n) | n \u2265 1}\nwhere\nD(n)k =\n\n\u001a\n\nQ : k = n \u2212 1, n\n0 : else\n\nand d : D(n)n\u22121 \u2192 D(n)n is the identity map. The set I of generating cofibrations\nconsists of the inclusions\nin : S(n) \u2192 D(n)\n\nfor n \u2265 1\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\u001a\n\nQ\n0\nConsider the pair of adjoint functors\nk\n\nS(n) =\n\ni0 : 0 \u2192 S(0), i\u20320 : S(0) \u2192 0,\n\n: k=n\n: else.\n\n\u039b : Ch\u2217 (Q) \u21c4 CDGAQ : U,\nwhere \u039b is the \"free commutative cochain algebra\" functor satisfying \u039b(C, d) =\n \u0304 where d \u0304 is the derivation extending d, and U is the forgetful functor. It\n(\u039bC, d),\nis not difficult, as indicated in Example 3.7 in [20], to show that this adjoint pair\nsatisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 3.6 of [20].\nThere is thus a cofibrantly generated model structure on CDGAQ , with generating cofibrations and acyclic cofibrations\nI = {\u039bin , \u039bi\u20320 | n \u2265 0} and J = {\u039bjn | n \u2265 1},\nwhere \u039b(0) := Q. Let I \u2212 cell denote the smallest class of morphisms in CDGAQ\nthat contains I and that is closed under coproducts, cobase change and sequential\ncolimits. It is easy to see that I\u2212cell is exactly the class of relative Sullivan algebras.\nIn this model structure on CDGAQ , weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms,\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n7\n\nand fibrations are degreewise surjections. Cofibrations are retracts of relative Sullivan algebras. All CDGA's are fibrant, and the Sullivan algebras are the cofibrant\nCDGA's.\nThe next result, which is the Lifting Axiom of model categories in the specific\ncase of CDGAQ , is an important tool in rational homotopy theory.\nProposition 1.13 (The Lifting Lemma).

Furthermore, any two lifts are homotopic relative to (A, d).\nWe can describe homotopy of CDGA morphisms with source a Sullivan algebra\nin terms of the following path objets. Let I denote the CDGA D(1), where the\ngenerators of degrees 0 and 1 are called t and y, respectively. Let \u03b50 : I \u2192 Q and\n\u03b51 : I \u2192 Q denote the augmentations specified by \u03b50 (t) = 0 and \u03b51 (t) = 1.\nProposition 1.14. Let (\u039bV, d) be a Sullivan algebra. Two CDGA morphisms\nf, g : (\u039bV, d) \u2192 (A, d) are homotopic if and only if there is a CDGA morphism\nH : (\u039bV, d) \u2192 (A, d) \u2297 I such that (IdA \u2297 \u03b50 )H = f and (IdA \u2297 \u03b51 )H = g.\nA careful, degree-by-degree version of the proof of the Small Object Argument\n(Theorem 3.5 in [20]) establishes the following useful result.\nProposition 1.15. Any morphism f : (A, d) \u2192 (B, d) in CDGAQ can be\nfactored as\n(A \u2297 \u039bU, D)\nMMM\nqq88\nMMMp\ni qqq\nMMM\nq\u2243\nq\nq\nM&&\nqq\nf\n// (B, d)\n(A, d)\nMMM\n88\nq\nq\nMMM\n\u2243 qqq\nM\nqqq\nj MMM\n&&\nqqq\n(A \u2297 \u039bV, D)\nwhere i and j are relative Sullivan algebras, and p and q are surjections.\nIf we are willing to sacrifice surjectivity of q, we can obtain minimality of j,\nagain via a degree-by-degree construction.\nProposition 1.16.

In particular,\nif H0 A \u223c\n= Q, H1 A = 0 and H\u2217 B is of finite type, then W is of finite type and\n\u22652\nW =W .\n\u2243\n\nDefinition 1.17. The quasi-isomorphism \u03c6 : (A \u2297 \u039bW, D) \u2212\n\u2192 (B, d) is a\nrelative Sullivan minimal model of f : A \u2192 B.

Then f\u02c6 is also an\nisomorphism.\nThe proof of this proposition reduces to showing that if a CDGA endomorphism\nof a minimal relative Sullivan algebra (B \u2297 \u039bW, D) that fixes B is homotopic to\nthe identity, then it is equal to the identity.\nThe functors. We now explain the passage from topology to algebra, starting\nwith the relationship between simplicial sets and CDGA's.\nDefinition 1.19. The algebra of polynomial differential forms, denoted A\u2217\u2022 , is\nthe simplicial CDGA given by\n\u0001\nA\u2217n = \u039b(t0 , ..., tn ; y0 , ..., yn )/Jn , d ,\n\nwhere deg\nP\nPtni = 0 and dti = yi for all i and Jn is the ideal generated by {1 \u2212\nn\nt\n,\ni=0 i\nj=0 yj }.

Let \u03a9DR (\u2206n ) be the cochain algebra of smooth forms on \u2206n , the standard\ntopological n-simplex. Then\n\u03a9DR (\u2206n ) = C \u221e (\u2206n ) \u2297A0n A\u2217n ,\nwhere the cochain algebra morphisms induced by the topological face inclusions\nand degeneracy maps agree with \u2202i and si .\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n9\n\nDefinition 1.20.

Sullivan models\nSince the CDGA APL (X) is huge and has a complicated product, rational\nhomotopy theorists prefer to carry out computations with the Sullivan minimal\nmodel, which is free as an algebra, with only finitely many generators in each\ndimension if X is of finite rational type. In this section, we provide a brief overview\nof the power of the Sullivan model. We begin by providing a few explicit examples\nof Sullivan minimal models. We then explore the relationship between topological\nfibrations and the Sullivan model. In particular, we explain the slogan \"the Sullivan\nmodel of fiber is the cofiber of the Sullivan model\" and illustrate its application.\nA classical and essential numerical homotopy invariant, Lusternik-Schnirelmann\ncategory, is our next subject: its elementary properties, how to calculate it using\nthe Sullivan model and its additivity.

Since \u03c6 is obviously a quasi-isomorphism of CDGA's, the nontorsion and\npositive-degree part of \u03c0\u2217 S 2n+1 is concentrated in degree 2n + 1, where it is of rank\n1.\nOn the other hand, the Sullivan model of an even sphere S 2n is\n\u03c6 : (\u039b(y2n , z4n\u22121 ), d) \u2212\u2192 APL (S 2n ),\nwhere dz = y 2 and \u03c6(y) represents the unique cohomology generator of degree 2n.\nSince the square of \u03c6(y) must be a boundary, there is an acceptable choice of \u03c6(z).\nAgain, \u03c6 is clearly a quasi-isomorphism of CDGA's, implying that the nontorsion\npart of \u03c0\u2217 S 2n is concentrated in degrees 2n and 4n \u2212 1 and that it is of rank 1 in\neach of those degrees.\nComplex projective spaces.

The value of dx is nonzero since H \u2217 (CP n ; Q) is zero in odd degrees.\nThe Sullivan model for CP \u221e is even easier to specify since there can be no\nnontrivial differential.

One of the most spectacular successes of the Sullivan minimal model has been in its application to studying and\nexploiting the numerical homotopy invariant known as Lusternik-Schnirelmann (L.S.) category.\nDefinition 2.6. A categorical covering of a space X is an open cover of X\nsuch that each member of the cover is contractible in X. The L.-S. category of a\ntopological space X, denoted cat X, is equal to n if the cardinality of the smallest\ncategorical covering of X is n + 1.\nL.-S. category is in general extremely difficult to compute. It is trivial, however,\nto prove that the L.-S. category of a contractible space is 0 and that cat S n = 1 for\nall n. Similarly, the L.-S. category of any suspension is 1. More generally, a space\nX is a co-H-space if and only if cat X \u2264 1.\nThe proof of this last equivalence is most easily formulated in terms of an\nequivalent definition of L.-S. category, which requires the following construction,\ndue to Ganea.\nDefinition 2.7. Let p : E \u2212\u2192 X be a fibration over a based topological space\n(X, x0 ). Let j : F \u0592\u2192 E denote the inclusion of the fiber of p over x0 , with mapping\ncone Cj .

If X is a normal space, then cat X \u2264 n if and only if the\nfibration pn admits a section.\nFor a proof of this proposition, we refer the reader to Proposition 27.8 in [18].\nAnother equivalent definition of the L.-S. category of a based space (X, x0 ) is\nexpressed in terms of the fat wedge on X\nT n X := {(x1 , ..., xn ) \u2208 X n | \u2203 i such that xi = x0 }.\nProposition 2.9.

If X is an (r \u2212 1)-connected CW-complex of dimension d,\nwhere r \u2265 1, then cat X \u2264 d/r.\nOn the other hand, a lower bound on cat X is given by the cuplength c(X) of\nH \u2217 (X; Q), i.e, the greatest integer n such that there exist a1 , ..., an \u2208 H \u2217 (X; Q)\nsatisfying a1 \u222a* * *\u222aan 6= 0. We leave it as an easy exercise to prove that c(X) \u2264 cat X\nfor all path-connected, normal spaces X.\nExample 2.11. Observe that c(CP n ) = n, so that cat CP n \u2265 n. On the other\nhand, CP n is 1-connected and of dimension 2n, implying that cat CP n \u2264 2n/2 = n.\nThus, cat CP n = n.\nWithin the realm of rational homotopy theory, it makes sense to consider the\nfollowing invariant derived from L.-S. category.\nDefinition 2.12. The rational category of a simply connected space X, denoted cat0 X, is defined by\ncat0 X := min{cat Y | X and Y have the same rational homotopy type}.\nAs proved in [18] (Proposition 28.1), if X is a simply connected CW-complex,\nthen cat0 X = cat X0 . Furthermore, it is obvious that cat0 X \u2264 cat X for all X.\nAs we show below, this inequality is sharp, i.e., there are spaces X for which\ncat0 X = cat X. On the other hand, the inequality can certainly be strict, as the\ncase of a mod p Moore space easily illustrates.\nThe next theorem has turned out to be a crucial tool in proving numerous\nsignificant results in rational homotopy theory, such as many of the dichotomy\ntheorems (cf., Section 2.4).\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n19\n\nTheorem 2.13 (The Mapping Theorem).

There is\nnow a purely topological and relatively simple proof, which is given in [18] (Theorem\n28.6).\nAs a first application of the Mapping Theorem, we mention the amusing and\nuseful corollary below, which follows immediately from the fact that the natural\nmap from the (n + 1)st Postnikov fiber to the nth Postnikov fiber of a space induces\nan injection on homotopy groups.\nCorollary 2.14. Let X be a connected CW-complex. Let X(n) denote the\nnth Postnikov fiber of X, for all n \u2265 1. Then\n* * * \u2264 cat0 X(n + 1) \u2264 cat0 X(n) \u2264 * * * \u2264 cat0 X(2) \u2264 cat0 X.\nOne great advantage of rational category, as opposed to the usual L.-S. category,\nis that it can explicitly calculated in terms of the Sullivan model, as stated in the\nnext theorem.\n\u2243\n\n// APL (X) be the Sullivan minimal model\nTheorem 2.15.

Since H n (S n ; Q) = Q, the rationalization S0n of the n-sphere\nis not contractible and therefore cat0 S n = cat S0n > 0. On the other hand,\ncat0 S n \u2264 cat S n = 1, whence cat0 S n = 1, providing the promised example of\nequality between rational category and L.-S. category of a space.\nThis calculation can also be carried out easily using the Sullivan model (cf.,\nSection 2.1). If n is odd, then the Sullivan model is (\u039b(x), 0), where x is of degree\nn. Observe that \u039b(x)/\u039b>1 (x) is isomorphic to \u039b(x), since x is of odd degree. Since\nthe quotient map q is itself the identity map in this case, it follows trivially that\ncat0 S n \u2264 1.\nIf n is even, the relevant Sullivan model is (\u039b(y, z), d), where deg y = n, deg z =\n2n \u2212 1 and dz = y 2 . An easy calculation shows that\n \u0304 = (Q \u2295 Q * y \u2295 Q * z, 0).\n(\u039b(y, z)/\u039b>1(y, z), d)\n\n\f20\n\nKATHRYN HESS\n\nIt is not too difficult to show that the quotient map q factors as\nq\n// (Q \u2295 Q * y \u2295 Q * z, , 0)\n(\u039b(y, z), d)\nQQQ\njjj55\nQQQ\n\u2243 jjjj\nQQQ\nj\nj\nQQQ\njj p\ni\nQ((\njjjj\n(\u039b(y, z) \u2297 \u039bW, D)\n\nwhere DW \u2282 \u039b(y, z)\u2297 \u039b+ W , i.e., the differential of any generator of W , if nonzero,\nis a sum of words, all of which contain at least one letter from W . We can therefore\ndefine a CDGA retraction \u03c1 by setting \u03c1(w) = 0 for all w \u2208 W , implying that\ncat0 S n \u2264 1.\nThough Theorem 2.15 does simplify the calculation of rational category by\nmaking it purely algebraic, the computations involved are still difficult, which led\nHalperin and Lemaire to propose the following, apparently weaker numerical invariant of rational homotopy [23].\nDefinition 2.17. Let X be a simply connected space of finite rational type,\n\u2243\n// APL (X). If the map i in diagram (2.1) of\nwith Sullivan model \u03c6 : (\u039bV, d)\nTheorem 2.15 admits a retraction as morphisms in the category of (\u039bV, d)-modules,\nthen Mcat0 X \u2264 n.\nAs it turned out, however, the apparent weakness of Mcat0 was only an illusion.\nTheorem 2.18. Mcat0 X = cat0 X for all simply connected spaces X of finite\nrational type.\nFor the proof of this theorem, which requires a deep understanding of the\nfactorization of the quotient map, we refer the reader to Theorem 29.9 in [18].\nTheorem 2.18 implies that to show that cat0 X \u2264 n, it suffices to find a (\u039bV, d)module retraction of i in diagram (2.1), which has proven to be a very effective\nsimplification. We next outline briefly one application of this simplification, to the\nstudy of the additivity of L.-S. category.\nIt is not difficult to show that cat(X \u00d7 Y ) \u2264 cat X + cat Y for all normal spaces\nX and Y . At the end of the 1960's Ganea observed that in the only known examples\nfor which cat(X \u00d7 Y ) 6= cat X + cat Y , the spaces X and Y had homology torsion\nat distinct primes. He conjectured therefore that cat(X \u00d7 S n ) = cat X + 1 for all\nspaces X and all n \u2265 1, since S n has no homology torsion whatsoever.\nIn fact, as stated precisely below, if we forget torsion completely and work\nrationally, then L.-S. category is indeed additive.\nTheorem 2.19. If X and Y are simply connected topological spaces of finite\nrational type, then cat0 (X \u00d7 Y ) = cat0 X + cat0 Y.\nThe proof of this theorem depends in an essential way on Theorem 2.18. We\nrefer the reader to Sections 29(h) and 30(a) in [18] for further details.\nAs an epilogue to this story of Sullivan minimal models and L.-S. category, we\nmention that in 1997 Iwase applied classical homotopy-theoretic methods to the\nconstruction of a counter-example to Ganea's conjecture [26]. In particular, he\nbuilt a 2-cell complex X such that cat(X \u00d7 S n ) = 2 = cat X.\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n21\n\n2.4. Dichotomy. There is a beautiful dichotomy governing finite CW-complexes in rational homotopy theory, expressed as follows: the rational homotopy\ngroups of a finite CW-complex either are of finite total dimension as graded rational\nvector space or grow exponentially. We first examine the former case, that of elliptic\nspaces, then the latter case, that of hyperbolic spaces.\nDefinition 2.20. A simply connected topological space X is rationally elliptic\nif\ndim H\u2217 (X; Q) < \u221e and dim \u03c0\u2217 (X) \u2297 Q < \u221e.\nThe formal dimension fdim X of a rationally elliptic space X is defined by\nfdim X := max{k | Hk (\u039bV, d) 6= 0}.\nThe even exponents of a rationally elliptic space X are the postive integers a1 , ..., aq\nsuch that there is a basis (yj )1\u2264j\u2264q of \u03c0even X \u2297 Q with deg yj = 2aj . Similarly,\nthe odd exponents of X are the positive integers b1 , ..., bp such that there is a basis\n(xi )1\u2264i\u2264p of \u03c0odd X \u2297 Q with deg xi = 2bi \u2212 1.\nA minimal Sullivan algebra (\u039bV, d) is elliptic if the associated rational space\n< (\u039bV, d) > is elliptic. The formal dimension of an elliptic minimal Sullivan algebra\nis the formal dimension of the associated space.\nExample 2.21. Spheres, complex projective spaces, products of elliptic spaces,\nand homogeneous spaces are examples of elliptic spaces.\nThe following special case of elliptic spaces is important for understanding\ngeneral elliptic spaces.\nDefinition 2.22. A minimal Sullivan algebra (\u039bV, d) is pure if dim V < \u221e,\nd|V even = 0 and d(V odd ) \u2286 \u039bV even . A space is pure if its Sullivan model is pure.\nNote that a pure space X is elliptic if and only if dim H\u2217 (X; Q) < \u221e.\nA pure Sullivan algebra (\u039bV, d) admits a differential filtration\nFk (\u039bV, d) = \u039bV even \u2297 \u039b\u2264k V odd .\nIn particular, dFk (\u039bV, d) \u2282 Fk\u22121 (\u039bV, d).

Filter (\u039bV, d) by\nM\nF p (\u039bV, d) =\n(\u039bV even \u2297 \u039bk V odd )l .\nk+l\u2265p\n\nThe induced spectral sequence is called the odd spectral sequence and converges to\nH\u2217 (\u039bV, d).\nObserve that the E0 -term of the odd spectral sequence is the associated graded\nof (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ), where d\u03c3 (V even ) = 0, d\u03c3 (V odd ) \u2286 \u039bV even and (d \u2212 d\u03c3 )(V odd ) \u2286\n\u039bV even \u2297 \u039b+ V odd . We call (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ) the associated pure Sullivan algebra of (\u039bV, d).\nProposition 2.25. Under the hypotheses of the definition above,\ndim H\u2217 (\u039bV, d) < \u221e \u21d4 dim H\u2217 (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ) < \u221e.\nThus, (\u039bV, d) is elliptic if and only if (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ) is elliptic.\nProof. As the odd spectral sequence converges from H\u2217 (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ) to H\u2217 (\u039bV, d),\none implication is clear. An algebraic version of the Mapping Theorem (Theorem\n2.13) plays an essential role in the rest of the proof. We refer the reader to Proposition 32.4 in [18] for the complete proof.\n\u0003\nExample 2.26. Consider (\u039bV, d) = (\u039b(a2 , x3 , u3 , b4 , v5 , w7 ), d), where the subscript of a generator equals its degree and d is specified by da = 0, dx = 0, du = a2 ,\ndb = ax, dv = ab \u2212 ux and dw = b2 \u2212 vx. Its associated pure Sullivan algebra is\n(\u039b(a, x, u, b, v, w), d\u03c3 ), where d\u03c3 a = 0, d\u03c3 x = 0, d\u03c3 u = a2 , d\u03c3 b = 0, d\u03c3 v = ab and\nd\u03c3 w = b2 . A straightforward calculation shows that\nH\u2217 (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ) = Q * a \u2295 Q * b \u2295 \u039by/(y 3 ) \u2295 \u039bz/(z 3),\nwhere y is represented by bu \u2212 av and z is represented by aw \u2212 bv. In particular\ndim H\u2217 (\u039bV, d\u03c3 ) < \u221e, which implies that (\u039bV, d) is elliptic.\nThe next theorem describes the amazing numerology of elliptic spaces and\nSullivan algebras, which imposes formidable constraints on their form.\nTheorem 2.27. Let (\u039bV, d) be an elliptic, minimal Sullivan algebra of formal\ndimension n and with even and odd exponents a1 , ..., aq ; b1 , ..., bp .

One first proves by induction on dim V that the formal dimensions of\n(\u039bV, d) and of its associated pure Sullivan algebra are the same, reducing the proof\nof the theorem to the pure case.

Moreover, as stated more precisely in the next theorem (Theorem 33.3 in [18]), there\nare no \"long gaps\" in the rational homotopy groups of X.\nTheorem 2.34. If X is a rationally hyperbolic space of formal dimension n,\nthen for all k \u2265 1, there exists i \u2208 (k, k + n) such that \u03c0i X \u2297 Q 6= 0.

Commutative algebra and rational homotopy theory\nIn the late 1970's two algebraists, Luchezar Avramov, then at the University\nof Sofia, and Jan-Erik Roos of the University of Stockholm, discovered and began\nto exploit a deep connection between local algebra and rational homotopy theory.\nIn 1981 they established contact with the rational homotopy theorists, initiating\na powerful synergy that led to a multitude of important results in both fields. In\nthis section, of a more expository nature than the preceding sections, we describe\ncertain of the most important results of this collaboration. For further details we\nrefer the reader to Section 4 of [24].\nRoos' interest in rational homotopy theory was inspired by work of Jean-Michel\nLemaire on Serre's question concerning rationality of Poincar\u00e9 series of the rational\nhomology of loop spaces and by the work of local algebraists on the analogous\nquestion of Kaplansky and Serre for local rings. More precisely, Lemaire had studied\nthe Poincar\u00e9 series\nX\ndimQ Hn (\u03a9E; Q) * z n\nn\u22650\n\nfor E a finite, simply connected CW-complex, while local algebraists were interested\nin the series\nX\ndimF ExtnR (F, F) * z n\nn\u22650\n\nfor R a local ring with residue field F. (Here and throughout this section, all local\nrings are assumed to be commutative and noetherian.) In both cases, the goal was\nto determine whether the series always represented a rational function.\nRoos established a research program to study the homological properties of local\nrings, in particular those whose maximal ideal m satisfied m3 = 0, the first nontrivial\ncase for Poincar\u00e9 series calculations. He realized that in order to study local rings,\nit was useful, or even necessary, to work in the larger category of (co)chain algebras.\nBy 1976 he had proved the equivalence of Serre's problem for CW-complexes E such\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n25\n\nthat dim E = 4 and of the Kaplansky-Serre problem for local rings (R, m) such that\nm3 = 0 [31].\nAvramov ascribes his original interest in rational homotopy theory to Levin's\nresult from 1965 that if R is a local ring with residue field F, then TorR (F, F) is\na graded, divided powers Hopf algebra [27]. Since the dual of a graded, divided\npowers Hopf algebra is the universal enveloping algebra of a uniquely defined graded\nLie algebra (char F = 0 [30], char F > 2 [1], char F = 2 [32]), to any local ring R is\nassociated a graded Lie algebra \u03c0 \u2217 (R), the homotopy Lie algebra of R. Based on\nresults in characteristic 0 due to Gulliksen in the late 1960's, Avramov proved that\nif R \u2212\u2192 S is a homomorphism of local rings such that S is R-flat, then there is an\nexact sequence of groups\n\u03b4n\n\n... \u2192 \u03c0 n R \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 n (S \u2297R F) \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 n (S) \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 n (R) \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2192 \u03c0 n+1 (S \u2297R F) \u2212\u2192 \u03c0 n+1 S \u2192 ....\n\nThe existence of such a long exact sequence of homotopy groups confirmed Avramov's intuition that rational homotopy invariants were analogous to homology\ninvariants of local rings in arbitrary characteristic.\nIn 1980 David Anick constructed a finite, simply connected CW-complex E of\ndimension \u2264 4 such that the Poincar\u00e9 series of the homology of \u03a9E was not rational\n[2], [3]. Anick's construction interested rational homotopy theorists because of its\nrelation to the dichotomy between elliptic and hyperbolic spaces; see Section 2.4.\nLocal algebraists were interested because of Roos's result, which allowed the transcription of Anick's space into a local ring (R, m) with m3 = 0 and with irrational\nPoincar\u00e9 series. Shortly after Anick's result became known, Roos and his student\nClas L\u00f6fwall discovered other examples of local rings with irrational Poincar\u00e9 series\nthat they obtained by completely different methods [29].\nThe converging interests of rational homotopy theorists and of local algebraists\nled to direct contact between the two groups in 1981. Inspired by the work of Roos\nand his colleagues, F\u00e9lix and Thomas began to work on calculating the radius of\nconvergence of the Poincar\u00e9 series of a loop space [19], establishing the following\nbeautiful characterization: a simply connected space E of finite L. -S. category is\nrationally elliptic if and only if the radius of convergence of the Poincar\u00e9 series of\n\u03a9E is 1. If E is rationally hyperbolic, then the radius of convergence is strictly less\nthan 1. Moreover, they found a relatively easily computable upper bound for the\nradius of convergence in the case of a hyperbolic, formal space. They also showed\nthat if A is a noetherian, connected graded commutative algebra over a field F of\ncharacteristic zero and \u03c1A denotes the radius of convergence of\nX\nn\nPA (z) =\ndimF TorA\nn (F, F) * z ,\nn\u2265o\n\nthen either \u03c1A = +\u221e and A is a polynomial algebra; or \u03c1A = 1, A is a complete\nintersection, and the coefficients of PA (z) grow polynomially; or \u03c1A < 1, A is not a\ncomplete intersection, and the coefficients of PA (z) grow exponentially. Avramov\nlater generalized this result to any characteristic [6].\nThe written version of Avramov's Luminy talk on the close links between local\nalgebra and rational homotopy theory provides an excellent and thorough introduction to the subject [7]. His article contains the first \"dictionary\" between rational\nhomotopy theory and local algebra, explaining how to translate notions and techniques from one field to the other. Given a theorem in one field, applying the\ndictionary leads to a statement in the other field that stands a reasonable chance\nof being true, though the method of proof may be completely different.\n\n\f26\n\nKATHRYN HESS\n\nAvramov and Halperin wrote another thorough introduction to the subject in\nthe proceedings of the Stockholm conference of 1983 [8]. It begins at a more elementary level than the survey article of Avramov in the proceedings of the Luminy\nconference, leading the reader from first principles of differential graded homological algebra to notions of homotopy fiber and loop space and on to the homotopy\nLie algebra.\nIn his introductory article [7], Avramov emphasized the importance of minimal\nmodels in local ring theory. If K R is the Koszul complex of a local ring, then there\nis a minimal, commutative cochain algebra (\u039bV, d) over the residue field of R that\nis quasi-isomorphic to K R . Avramov called (\u039bV, d) the minimal model of R. He\nestablished its relevance by observing that in degrees greater than 1, the graded\nLie algebra derived from (\u039bV, d2 ) is isomorphic to the homotopy Lie algebra of R.\nIn [17] F\u00e9lix, Halperin, and Thomas continued the in-depth study of the homotopy Lie algebra of a rationally hyperbolic space begun by F\u00e9lix and Halperin in\n[14]. They showed, for example, that if E is rationally hyperbolic, then its rational homotopy Lie algebra is not solvable. Moreover they proposed as conjectures\ntranslations of their theorems into local algebra, where, for a local ring (R, m) with\nresidue field F, L.-S. category is replaced by dimF (m/m2 ) \u2212 depth R and infinite\ndimensional rational homotopy is replaced by R not being a complete intersection.\nRecall that\ndepth R = inf{j | ExtjR (F, R) 6= 0}.\nIn [17] F\u00e9lix, Halperin and Thomas also mentioned a very important conjecture\ndue to Avramov and F\u00e9lix, stating that the homotopy Lie algebra of a rationally\nhyperbolic space should contain a free Lie algebra on at least two generators. This\nconjecture has motivated much interesting work in the study of the homotopy Lie\nalgebra and has not as yet (2006) been proved.\nUsing minimal model techniques, Halperin and B\u00f8gvad proved two conjectures\ndue to Roos, which are \"translations\" of each other [9]. They showed that\n(1) if R is a local ring such that the Yoneda algebra Ext\u2217R (F, F) is noetherian,\nthen R is a complete intersection; and\n(2) if E is a simply connected, finite CW-complex such that the Pontryagin\nalgebra H\u2217 (\u03a9E; Q) is noetherian, then E is rationally elliptic.\nTheir proof is based on a slightly weakened form of the Mapping Theorem that\nholds over a field of any characteristic, as well as on ideas from the article of F\u00e9lix,\nHalperin and Thomas of the previous year [17].\nIn the spring of 1985 Halperin applied minimal model techniques to answering\non old question concerning the deviations of a local ring [22]. The jth deviation,\nej (R), of a noetherian, local, commutative ring R with residue field F is dimF \u03c0 j (R).\nAssmus had shown in 1959 that R is a complete intersection if and only if ej (R) = 0\nfor all j > 2 [4], raising the question of whether any deviation could vanish if R\nwere not a complete intersection. Halperin succeeded in answering this question,\nshowing that if R is not a complete intersection, then ej 6= 0 for all j.\nThe Five Author paper [15] represents a great leap forward in understanding\nthe structure of the homotopy Lie algebra of a space or of a local ring. The principal\ninnovation of the Five Author paper consists in exploiting the radical of the homotopy Lie algebra, i.e., the sum of all of its solvable ideals, which rational homotopy\ntheorists had begun to study in 1983. The radical itself is in general not solvable.\n\n\fRATIONAL HOMOTOPY THEORY\n\n27\n\nRecall, as mentioned above, that the rational homotopy Lie algebra of a rationally\nhyperbolic space is not solvable.\nExpressed in topological terms, the main theorem of the Five Author paper\nstates that if E is a simply connected CW-complex of finite type and cat(E) =\nm < \u221e, then the radical of the homotopy Lie algebra, Rad(E) is finite dimensional\nand dim Rad(E)even \u2264 m. This is a consequence of two further theorems, both\nof which are of great interest themselves. The first concerns the relations among\nthe rational L.-S. category of a space and the depth and global dimension of its\nhomotopy Lie algebra. Recall that the gobal dimension of a local ring R with\nresidue field F satisfies\ngl. dim.(R) = sup{j | ExtjR (F, F) 6= 0}.\nThe precise statement of this theorem in topological terms is then that if L is the\nhomotopy Lie algebra of a simply-connected CW-complex of finite type E, then\neither\ndepth U L < cat0 (E) < gl. dim. U L\nor\ndepth U L = cat0 (E) = gl. dim. U L.\nThe second theorem states that under the same hypotheses, if depth U L < \u221e, then\nRad(E) is finite dimensional and satisfies dim Rad(E)even \u2264 depth U L. Moreover,\nif dim Rad(E)even = depth U L, then Rad(E) = L.\nRational homotopy theorists have exploited extensively the results of [15] in\ndeveloping a deep understanding of the homotopy Lie algebra of rationally hyperbolic spaces. The methods the five authors devised to prove their results have\nturned out to be extremely important as well. For example, since their goal was\nto relate cat0 (E) to depth(L), they needed to construct a model of the quotient\n \u0304 where (\u039bV, d) is the Sullivan minimal model of E.\ncochain algebra (\u039bV /\u039b>n V, d),\nTheir method for doing so, based on perturbation of a model for (\u039bV /\u039b>n V, d2 ),\nproved to be useful in a number of other circumstances, such as in the proof of\nTheorem 2.18.\nReferences\n[1] M.
