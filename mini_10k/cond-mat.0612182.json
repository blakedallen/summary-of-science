Introduction\nSince the discovery of the remarkable thermoelectric behaviors in NaxCo2O4 [1], an\nintense research interest has been stimulated in alkali-metal intercalated layered cobaltites\ndue to their potential technological applications [2-4]. The recent observations of\nsuperconductivity in Na0.33CoO2*1.3H2O [5], charge ordering in Na0.5CoO2 [6] and\ncomplex magnetic structures in NaxCoO2 (x=0.67, 0.75) [7] have further heightened the\ninterest in this kind of materials. Intercalation of divalent ions (Ca2+, Sr2+) into cobalt\noxides was expected to improve the thermoelectric properties. For instance, Sr0.35CoO2\nshows a Seebeck coefficient comparable to that of NaxCoO2 [8]; partial substitution of Ca\nfor Na in NaxCoO2 also gave an enhancement in both Seebeck coefficient and electric\nresistivity [2, 9]. Structural investigations revealed that the intercalations of either Na (Sr)\natoms or H2O molecules could make the local structure very complex; the intercalated\natoms can be random with high mobility or crystallized in certain ordered states [10].\nRecently, we have successfully prepared a series of samples with nominal composition of\nCaxCoO2 (0.25\u2264x\u22640.5) and SrxCoO2 (0.25\u2264x\u22640.4) by the low-temperature ion-exchange\ntechnique. Structural analysis by means of transmission-electron microscopy and x-ray\ndiffraction suggested that the well-defined Sr-ordered state only appears at x \u2245 1/3 in\nSrxCoO2 (0.25\u2264x\u22640.4) system [11], materials with other Sr concentrations contain\nevident structural imhomogeneity and phase separation. Moreover, it is noted that the\nstructure of Sr0.35CoO2 is modulated by Sr ordering which yields a superstructure of\n31/2a\u00d731/2a [11]. This specific superstructure was expected to have large effects on the\ncharge ordering and magnetic structures as theoretically demonstrated by first principle\n\n2\n\n\fcalculations [12]. In this paper, we report on the electronic band structure of Sr0.35CoO2\ncalculated by LSDA and LSDA+U with 0\u2264U\u22648eV. Certain theoretical EELS are analyzed\nin comparison with the experimental ones.\n\n2. Computational details and experimental methods\n2.1. Theoretical approach\nThe crystal structure of Sr0.35CoO2 used in our calculation was based on the x-ray\ndiffraction result as reported by R. Ishikawa et al [8]. This phase has the lattice\nparameters of a=2.820\u00c5 and c=11.525\u00c5 with the space group of P63/mmc. The partially\noccupied Sr sites were simulated by virtual crystal approximation [13]. The full potential\nlinearized augmented-plane-wave+local orbital (APW+LO) were used as implemented\nin WIEN2k code and its LDA+U extension [14, 15]. Self-consistency was carried out on\na 16\u00d716\u00d73 mesh containing 60 k-points in the irreducible Brillouin zone (BZ). RmtKmax\nwas set to 7.0 to determine the basis size. The parameter for exchange interaction (J) in\nthe LSDA+U calculation were taken as J=0.965eV [16]. The core-loss EELS were\ncalculated using TELNES program of the WIEN2k distribution [17].\n\n2.2. Experiment\nPolycrystalline materials of Sr0.35CoO2 were prepared by the low-temperature ion\nexchange reaction from the\u03b3-Na0.7CoO2 precursor prepared by conventional solid-state\nreaction [8, 11]. The measurements of EELS were performed on a Tecnai F20\ntransmission electron microscope equipped with a post column Gatan imaging filter. The\n\n3\n\n\fenergy resolution in the EEL spectra is 0.75eV under normal operation conditions. Our\nEELS experiments were performed with the convergence angle of ~0.7mrad and the\nspectrometer collection angle of ~3.0mrad.\n\n3. Results and discussion\n3.1. Band structure\nFig.1 shows the calculated LSDA band structure of Sr0.35CoO2 near Fermi level (EF):\n(a) spin up electrons and (b) spin down electrons. The crystal-field split of the Co 3d\nbands (eg-t2g) is estimated to be around 2eV in present system, which is smaller than that\n(~2.5eV) in NaxCoO2 materials [13]. The unoccupied eg states with a narrow bandwidth\nof around 0.9eV appear at 1.2eV above EF; the t2g states with the bandwidth of ~1.8eV\nare intersected by EF. The occupied O 2p bands extend from -7eV to -1.5eV. The t2g\nmanifold splits into a1g and e'g bands in the rhombohedral crystal field as discussed in\nNaxCoO2 (0<x<0.7) materials [13]. The primarily a1g character is emphasized with\ndark-circles proportional to its amount. The a1g band has almost the same bandwidth as\nthe t2g manifold. In comparison with the band structure of NaxCoO2 materials, the a1g\nbands in Sr0.35CoO2 are noticeably depressed at \u0393(k=0) point, and partially go down EF.\nThey also show apparent dispersions along the \u0393-A line in sharp contrast to the flat\nbands with little c-axis dispersion in NaxCoO2 system [13]. Fig. 2 shows the LSDA\nFermi surface (FS) for Sr0.35CoO2, which was calculated on a 45\u00d745\u00d79 mesh containing\n960 k-points in the irreducible BZ and viewed by XCrySDen package [18]. The Fermi\nlevel crosses both the a1g and one of the e'g bands; the t2g manifold produces a small and\n\n4\n\n\fa large Fermi surfaces around the \u0393 point; the e'g band produces six pockets near K\npoints in the Brillouin zone (BZ) in the direction of K-\u0393. The remarkable feature of FS\ntopology, notably different from NaxCoO2, is the six small pockets showing up as holey\nellipsoids containing e'g holes instead of six small cylinders in Na0.5CoO2 [13]. This\nalternation results from the apparent increase of c-dispersions of the t2g bands in\nSr0.35CoO2. Integration of unoccupied states in the density of states (DOS) give rise to\n0.28 holes/Co to account for the Sr0.35CoO2 phase in which two 5s electrons arise from\nper Sr atom.\nPreviously, we have performed a series of experimental measurements on SrxCoO2\nmaterials. It is found that the transport property of the Sr0.35CoO2 polycrystalline samples\ndepends sensitively on annealing conditions; their resistivities in general are metallic [8,\n11] in agreement with the half-metallic band structure as illustrated in fig.1.\nExperimental measurements on the magnetic properties of Sr0.35CoO2 indicate that\nmagnetic susceptibility (\u03c7) increases with lowering temperature and obeys the\nCurie-Weiss law. Above 50 K, \u03c7 can be well fitted by the formula \u03c7(T)=C/(T-\u03b8), with \u03b8\n= -133.1K, The negative value of \u03b8 indicates that the spin correlations are\nantiferromagnetic (AFM) . The fitting parameters allow us to give rise to the effective\nmoments as 1.36\u03bcB/Co in Sr0.35CoO2, which is close to that of NaxCoO2 with x ~0.7\nantiferromagnetic spin correlations above 50K [11]. In order to understand the observed\nantiferromagnetic correlation, we have performed a further calculation based on a simple\nAFM model by flipping one of the Co spin (two Co atoms/cell) to form an interlayer\nAFM structure with a space group of P-3m1. Our LSDA calculation indicated that the\n\n5\n\n\fground state of this model tends to converge at a FM state rather than the expected AFM\nstate. Hence, a larger unit cell may be needed in further study of magnetic properties.\nIt is generally agreed that the Coulomb correlation should be concerned for the\nunderstanding of physical properties in NaxCoO2 system, the correlation effects and\nstrength could vary with the doping level [19]. The Sr0.35CoO2 material also has a narrow\nt2g band with bandwidth W=1.8eV in comparison with the estimated U for Co (5-8eV)\n[13]. We therefore employed the LSDA+U method to study the correlated effect on\nelectronic band structure in present system with U ranging from 0 to 8eV. Fig. 3 shows\nthe density of states (DOS) for four typical U values, the partial DOS of Co 3d and O 2p\nstates are respectively plotted by dashed line and dotted line. It is found that the\nelectronic structure is sensitive to the variation of U. The spin-down unoccupied a1g\nstates split progressively from the valence band along with the U increase from 0 to 3eV.\nAs U is larger than 3eV, the spin-up eg bands shift noticeably toward the lower energy\ndirection, and on the other hand, the spin down t2g bands shift in opposite direction\ntoward the higher energy region. As a result, additional unoccupied t2g states appear\nabove EF.\n\n3.2. Comparison between theoretical and experimental EELS\nElectron energy-loss near-edge structure provides the unoccupied partial DOS around\nthe excited atom, so we performed a series of experimental EELS measurements on\nSr0.35CoO2 and compared with the theoretical results. Fig. 4 (a) and (b) show respectively\nthe oxygen K-edge and Co L23-edge core loss EELS after background subtraction for\n\n6\n\n\fSr0.35CoO2, both experimental data and numerous theoretical results are displayed for\ncomparison. The resolutions of all calculated spectra are lowered so that the major peaks\nhave the same full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) as the experimental ones. Analysis\nof spectral features for different Coulomb interactions (U) suggests that critical\nalternations for either the O K-edge or the Co L23-edge appear at around U=3eV; peak\nsplitting can clearly visible in all spectra for U\u22654eV.\nThe oxygen K-edge spectra gives the oxygen p-projected DOS of ground state and\nthe core hole potential does not have large effect on the spectral shape. The five main\npeaks as shown in fig.4 (a) can be well-interpreted base on our theoretical analysis. Peak\na appears at 1.6eV above Fermi level, representing the transitions from O 1s towards the\nunoccupied O 2p mixed with Co eg. Peak b, at ~ 6.5eV above peak a, arises from a\ncombination of transitions from O 1s to Sr 4p, Co 4p and O 2p. Peak c, at ~12eV above\npeak a, is much broader in comparison with peak a or b, reflecting the transitions from O\n1s to the unoccupied states mixed by Co 4s4p, Sr 4s4p and O 2p. Peak d and e in general\nare very broad as observed in other transition metal oxides, which correspond to the\nmixture of Co 4p3d, Sr 4p3d and O 2p. Previously, these broad peaks have been also\nanalyzed in connection with the single-scattering events from different oxygen\ncoordination shells as pointed out by H. Kurata [20]. It is noted that the calculated\nspectra for U\u22643eV can perfectly reproduce all peaks appearing in the experimental\nspectra, their positions, as well as intensities, are fundamentally in good agreement with\nthe experimental ones. The most striking feature in the theoretical O K-edge spectra is\nthe appearance of the remarkable split on the first peak a for U\u22654eV. This phenomenon\n\n7\n\n\fresults essentially from evolution of band structures along with the increase of U. The\nshifts of the spin up and spin down bands occur in opposite directions and yields\nadditional unoccupied spin down t2g states above EF for U\u22654eV. Hence, previous to the\npeak a, another new peak becomes visible reflecting the transitions to the new\nunoccupied states. These two peaks with around 2.2eV apart should be visible under our\nexperimental resolution. However, no evidence for peak splitting has been found in our\ncareful observations, we therefore conclude that the on-site interaction (U) in Sr0.35CoO2\nis less than 3eV. This conclusion is all supported by a further analysis of the Co L23-edge\nas demonstrated in fig. 4(b), in which peak a and b reflect respectively the transitions\nfrom Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 to unoccupied Co 3d states. EELS calculations for U\u22654eV\nreveal again the peak splitting for both L3 and L2 transitions. The experimental spectrum\nis qualitatively in consistence with theoretical data for U\u22643eV. Hence, Sr0.35CoO2 is a\nmoderately correlated system, the strength of the on-site coulomb interaction is notably\nsmaller than that estimated for NaxCoO2 (5-8eV) [13, 16]. It is also possible that the\ncorrelation effect/strength could vary with the doping level due to the change in electron\nscreening as discussed in NaxCoO2 [19].\n\n4. Conclusions\nIn conclusion, the band structure and Fermi surface topology of Sr0.35CoO2 have been\nstudied using LSDA. The Co 3d bands show up evident c-dispersions arising from\nnotable interplanar interaction in Sr0.35CoO2. These results suggest that Sr0.35CoO2\nshould be much more three-dimensional than the NaxCoO2 materials. The LSDA+U\n\n8\n\n\fcalculation reveals that the electronic structure, as well as the split between the spin-up\nand spin-down bands, changes remarkably along with the U increase, especially for\nU\u22654eV. Systematical analysis of the theoretical and experimental EELS for O K-edge\nand Co L23-edge suggests that the electronic correlation U in this system is less than 3eV.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe would like to thank Prof. B.
