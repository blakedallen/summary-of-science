Harrison\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0110278v1 [cond-mat.str-el] 15 Oct 2001\n\nNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory, LANL, MS-E536, Los Alamos, New Mexico 87545\n(November 21, 2018)\nThe inductive exchange of carriers between closed Fermi surface sections subject to Landau quantization and open Fermi surface sections subject to charge-density wave (or spin-density wave) formation is shown to give rise to persistent currents. This mechanism may explain recent experimental\ndata in certain organic conductors in high magnetic fields.\n\nIt is well known that a gradient in the orbital magnetization within a bulk metal corresponds to a net effective electrical current density j = \u2207 \u00d7 M [1]. Such\ncurrents can be true macroscopic flows of charged quasiparticles, created in response to changes of magnetic field\n(i.e. \u2202H/\u2202t) and, in the case of superconductors, applied\nmagnetic field H. They are considered to be \"persistent\" if they exist in equilibrium, and truly persistent\ncurrents are understood to exist only in superconductors [2]. In the type I superconducting phase, the Meissner effect screens all electromagnetic fields from within\nthe bulk [2], while in the type II superconducting phase,\nnet currents that permeate the bulk occur transverse to\na vortex density gradient held in place by vortex pinning [2]. Long-lived currents [3] also occur in quantum\nHall systems orthogonal to a chemical potential gradient\n\u2207\u03bc [4]. The equilibrium Hall electric field is sustained\nowing only to the absence of quasiparticle scattering processes orthogonal to the current [4].\nIn this paper, I identify a further mechanism for\npersistent currents involving the coexistence of orbital\nmagnetism with a charge-density wave (CDW) or spindensity wave (SDW) modulation [5]. With the pinning of\na CDW (or SDW) modulation [5], a situation can be realised whereby a differential chemical potential gradient\n2\u2207(\u2206\u03bc) exists between the CDW (or SDW) and additional ungapped sections of Fermi surface present. Currents result within the bulk if, and only if, the derivative\n\u2202M/\u2202(\u2206\u03bc) is finite within the bulk. This quantity is vanishingly small in most metals at low magnetic fields [6],\nbut can become quite significant when Landau levels are\nformed at high magnetic fields [7]. The development of\nthe gradient 2\u2207(\u2206\u03bc) relies on there being a continual relative exchange of carriers 2\u2202(\u2206N )/\u2202|H| between Fermisurface sheets as the magnetic field is swept [7]. Again,\nthis is a negligible effect at low magnetic fields, but becomes very significant when Landau levels are formed at\nhigh magnetic fields [7]. The mechanism for persistent\ncurrents in CDW (or SDW) systems, described here, will\ntherefore be seen to be quite different than that predicted\nby Fr\u00f6hlich [8].\nA multiband metal consisting of separate onedimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) Fermi surface sections is an ideal system in which to model these\n\neffects. Fermi surfaces of this topology are found to occur in several organic metals [9,10], and effects consistent with the existence of persistent currents have been\nobserved experimentally [11\u201314].\nI begin by considering a metal that consists of only\na single 2D pocket, characterized by a de Haas-van\nAlphen (dHvA) frequency F and cyclotron frequency\n\u03c9c = eB/m\u2217 , where B = B * \u1e91. When the quasiparticles move in planes perpendicular to the unit vector\n\u0001\n\u1e91, Landau levels with eigenvalues \u03b5 = h\u0304\u03c9c n + 21 are\nformed, where n = 0, 1, 2, . . .. The chemical potential\n\u03bc is pinned to the highest occupied of these in order to\nconserve the total number of 2D carriers, N2D [15]. It\nis instructive to consider contrasting situations at halfintegral and integral Landau level fillng factors \u03bd = F/B;\nat half-integral filling factors (when \u03bd + 21 is an integer)\nthe highest occupied Landau level is exactly half filled,\nwhile at integral filling factors (when \u03bd is an integer) \u03bc is\nin the transitional region between filled and empty levels.\nIn the low temperature limit (T \u2192 0), the corresponding\nsusceptibility components \u03c7zz = \u2202M/\u2202H are [15]\n\u03c7half =\n\nh\u0304\u03c9c F\ne\u03c1xy \u03bc0 H 2\n\nand\n\u03c7int = \u2212\n\n\u03c0\u03c9c \u03c4 h\u0304\u03c9c F\n4 e\u03c1xy \u03bc0 H 2\n\n(1)\n\nrespectively, where \u03c1xy is the off-diagonal component of\nthe resistivity tensor, M = M*\u1e91 and H = H*\u1e91. Note that\nthe susceptibility at integral filling factors is extremely\nsensitive to Landau level broadening that results from a\nfinite relaxation time \u03c4 [7]. It follows that M and \u03bc are\nrelated via the differential\n\u2202M\n1\nN2D\n\u1e91 =\n\u1e91,\n=\n\u2202\u03bc\n\u03bc0 H\ne\u03c1xy\n\n(2)\n\nwhere both e and \u03c1xy are negative for electrons and positive for holes [15].\nWhen 1D carriers are added to the system, they primarily function as a charge reservoir [7]. At half-integral\nfilling factors, carriers are transferred from the 1D sheets\nto the 2D pocket as H is increased, causing the magnetization to increase more quickly than in Equation (1).\n1\n\n\fAt integral filling factors, the inverse situation becomes\ntrue. The presence of 1D states in the Landau gaps prevents M and \u03bc from jumping abruptly between Landau\nlevels. The susceptibilities therefore become\n\u03c7half =\n\na finite value of \u2206\u03bc may already be required in order\n\u2032\nto minimise Equation (4) owing to the F2D\n(\u2206\u03bc) term.\nSuch an effect has already been considered to explain the\nsuppression of oscillations in \u03bc observed experimentally\nin certain organic metals [20]. I will not consider this\neffect in detail for two reasons: first, it is not expected to\noperate at half-integral and integral filling factors where\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bc = F2D\n(\u2212\u2206\u03bc) = \u2202F2D\n(\u2212\u2206\u03bc)/\u2202\u03bc = 0: second, I reveal\nbelow that it is unlikely that a uniform \u2206\u03bc is maintained\nthroughout the entire sample.\nIf the sample is field-cooled at \u03bc = \u2206\u03bc = 0, the starting condition of the sample corresponds to the point labeled '0' in Fig. 1. If the CDW (or SDW) is pinned,\nthis pinning initially prevents Q + \u2206Q from changing in\nresponse to a change in the applied magnetic field \u2206H.\nThe optimum value of Q does, however, change, leading\nto relative difference \u2206Q between the actual and optimal\nvalues, and finally to a shift in \u2206\u03bc. Since the density of\nstates at \u03bc in the gap on the 1D sheets is zero, the sample\nbegins by responding like a 2D metal in which there are\nno 1D states. From this point on, the magnetization becomes hysteretic. Consequently, the irreversible change\nin the magnetization is characterised by an irreversible\nsusceptibility given by the difference between Equations\n(1) and (3); hence\n\nh\u0304\u03c9c F\ng2D\n(g1D + g2D ) e\u03c1xy \u03bc0 H 2\n\nand\n\u03c7int = \u2212\n\ng1D\nh\u0304\u03c9c F\n,\n(g1D + g2D ) e\u03c1xy \u03bc0 H 2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere g1D and g2D represent the density of states of the\n1D sheets and 2D pocket respectively [7].\nThe process by which the 1D sheets function as a\ncharge reservoir becomes perturbed upon opening of a\ngap. For the purpose of modeling these perturbations,\nit is convenient to consider a simplified system in which\nthe Fermi surface nesting gaps the entire 1D density of\nstates and the effects of Zeeman splitting of the 1D bands\nare negligible. The latter is true in SDW systems [5] and\nalso in CDW phases in which the spin up and spin down\nbands nest independently [16,17]. By far the most important consideration is that the CDW (or SDW) phase\nremains stable over the field range where the dHvA oscillations occur. Persistent currents are anticipated only in\nthe case of an incommensurate CDW (or SDW) in which\nthe nesting vector Q can adjust itself in order to minimise the total free energy of the system. They are not\nexpected in the case of a commensurate CDW phase that\nis pinned to the crystal lattice [18]. Following the solution\nof the gap equation obtained by Maki and Tsuneto [19],\nadapted to include the effects of a shift in the chemical potential (labelled here as \u2206\u03bc) in Reference [18], the\nchange in free energy in forming such a CDW (or SDW)\ngroundstate can be written as\n\u0015\n\u0014 2\n\u22060\n\u2032\n2\n(\u2206\u03bc).\n(4)\n\u2212 (\u2206\u03bc) \u2212 F2D\nF = \u2212g1D\n2\n\n\u03c7irr,half = \u2212\n\nh\u0304\u03c9c F\ng1D\n,\n(g1D + g2D ) e\u03c1xy \u03bc0 H 2\n\nand\n\u03c7irr,int = \u2212\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\nh\u0304\u03c9c F\ng1D\n\u03c0\u03c9c \u03c4\n.\n\u2212\n4\n(g1D + g2D ) e\u03c1xy \u03bc0 H 2\n\n(5)\n\nAs expected for magnetic hystersis, \u03c7irr is always negative.\nFor a sample without boundary conditions, the magnetization would continue to change with the susceptibility given by Equation (5), giving rise to the dotted\nline in Figure 1. This would occur until \u2206\u03bc\n\u221a reaches\nthe thermodynamic limit, \u2206\u03bclim = \u00b1 \u22060 / 2, whereupon Equation (4) is no longer negative. At this point,\nthe magnitude of the irreversible magnetization would\nsaturate at a maximum\nvalue, Mirr,lim = \u00b1 \u2206\u03bclim \u00d7\n\u221a\n\u2202M/\u2202\u03bc = \u00b1 \u22060 z/ 2\u03c1xy , without any currents being\ninduced within the bulk of the sample. Just as in superconductors [2] and quantum Hall systems [4], however,\na net magnetization cannot exist within the bulk without incurring a current j immediately inside its surface.\nHere, the current is carried by 2D carriers, and wherever\nthese exist,\n\nThe first two terms of Equation (4) are minimised when\nthe zero-temperature gap 2\u22060 that opens on the 1D\nsheets is centred about \u03bc, so that an offset \u2206\u03bc of the\n\u2032\ngap relative to \u03bc costs energy. The third term, F2D\n(\u2206\u03bc),\naccounts for an additional (either positive or negative)\nchange in free energy of the 2D Landau level levels incurred by this offset. The offset translates directly into\nan increase in the number of states \u2206N1D = g1D \u2206\u03bc accommodated by the 1D sheets, balanced by an equal and\nopposite reduction in the number of states contained in\nthe 2D pocket. If Q is the component of the optimum\nnesting vector Q parallel to the mean Fermi velocity vF\nof the 1D sheets, \u2206\u03bc also results in a shift in this Q given\nby \u2206Q/\u2206\u03bc = Qg1D /N1D , where N1D is the equilibrium\nnumber of 1D states.\nShould Q be uniform throughout the sample as a result\nof cooling it in the presence of a constant magnetic field,\n\nj = \u2212\u2207(\u2206\u03bc) \u00d7\n\n\u2202M\n,\n\u2202\u03bc\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u2212\u2207(\u2206\u03bc) is the chemical potential gradient experienced by the 2D pocket. In order to maintain the equilibrium condition \u2207\u03bc = 0, an equal and opposite charge\npolarization field \u2207(\u2206\u03bc) must also form on the nested 1D\n2\n\n\fFermi surface sheets. Since CDWs (and SDWs) are electrostatically limited, rather than increasing indefinitely,\n\u2207(\u2206\u03bc) must eventually be limited by the characteristic\nthreshold electric field\n\u2207(\u2206\u03bc)lim = eEt\n\nto reverse the polarity of \u2207(\u2206\u03bc). The magnetization saturates again at point '4,' and a full hysteresis loop results\non further cycling of \u2206H.\nI now compare the predictions of this model with recent measurements made on samples of the organic conductor \u03b1-(BEDT-TTF)2 KHg(SCN)4 at high magnetic\nfields. This material has a Fermi surface which nearly\nmatches that of the model [10]. At low temperatures,\n<\nT <\n\u223c 8 K, and low magnetic fields, \u03bc0 H \u223c 23 T, \u03b1(BEDT-TTF)2 KHg(SCN)4 is believed to possess a commensurate CDW phase, transforming to one that is incommensurate at high magnetic fields \u03bc0 H >\n\u223c 23 T\n[11\u201313,17,18,22\u201324]. It is within the high magnetic field\nphase where effects consistent with persistent currents\nhave been reported [11\u201314].\nI begin my comparison by considering the irreversible\nsusceptibility. On computing \u03c7irr , using Equation (5)\nand the established parameters (F \u2248 670 T, m\u2217 \u2248 2 me ,\nN2D \u2248 1.6 \u00d7 1026 m\u22123 , g1D \u2248 g2D and \u03c4 \u2248 2 ps [25] for \u03b1(BEDT-TTF)2 KHg(SCN)4 ), the model estimates (\u03c7mod )\nlisted in Table I are found to agree rather well with the\nexperimental values (\u03c7exp ) [14] both at half-integral and\nintegral filling factors.\nI now estimate the threshold electric field from the\nsaturation magnetization Mirr,max (listed in Table I as\nMmax ). This is found to be marginally higher at halfintegral filling factors than at integral filling factors in\nReference [14], but becomes comparable at the lowest\ntemperatures [11]. Making the cylindrical sample approximation, with r \u223c 0.5 mm, one can estimate the\nmean scalar critical current jc using Equation (10) and\nthe corresponding threshold electric field Et using Equation (8). I believe the estimates in Table I to be physically realistic because the total potential difference across\nthe sample vt = rEt does\u221a not exceed the maximum\nthermodynamic potential 2e\u22060 \u223c 0.7 meV (where\n\u22060 \u223c 0.5 meV [11]) that can be sustained without destroying the CDW groundstate.\nNext, I consider the coercion fields required to reverse\nthe polarity of the current. On applying the simple expression for H \u2217 in Equation (10), the values estimated in\nTable I compare favourably with experimental observations [14]. The behaviour of the irreversible magnetization is also found to be very well described by a cubic law\nof the form given by Equation (9). Note that twice the\ninterval in field 2H \u2217 is required to reverse the polarity of\nthe currents throughout the entire sample. Meanwhile,\nthe maximum magnetic field that can be screened by the\nsample, \u03c7irr H \u2217 , is a small fraction of a millitesla.\nFinally, I consider an odd situation that occurs at\nthe minima and maxima of the dHvA oscillations where\nthe orbital susceptibility \u03c7 = \u2202M/\u2202H vanishes. Consequently, there will be discrete fields at which \u03c7irr \u2192 0\ncausing the irreversible magnetization never to reach saturation within the quarter period of the dHvA oscillations \u2206H = \u03bc0 H 2 /4F . Because there exists a chemical\n\n(7)\n\nrequired for its depinning. This equates to a critical current density\njc =\n\nEt \u00d7 \u1e91\n\u03c1xy\n\n(8)\n\nfor the carriers in the 2D pocket within the sample.\nFrom Equation (8), one can see that the electrodynamics has parallels with the quantum Hall effect [4], with\nthe exception that there exists zero net electric field in\nequilibrium: the quantity Et instead parameterizes the\ncharge polarization field required to slide the CDW (or\nSDW), that ultimately leads to dissipation. The absence\nof a net electric field implies that the effect, described\nhere, is not limited only to integral Landau level filling\nfactors. The inductive behaviour of the sample is, in\ncontrast, much more like that of a type II superconductor, but with an irreversible susceptibility \u03c7irr that can\ndepart significantly from the ideal diamagnetic value \u22121.\nAs \u2206H increases, the surface region in which Et is polarized propogates further into the sample. The inductive\nresponse of the sample to a change in applied magnetic\nfield \u2206H is therefore indistinguishable from the critical\nstate model developed by Bean [21], provided Et is finite for all directions within the planes. This is certainly\nthe case in CDW (or SDW) systems for which Q occurs\nat an oblique angle with respect to the lattice vectors,\nwhere Fermi surface nesting results in charge (or spin)\nmodulation that is two-dimensional.\nIf one considers a cylindrical sample of radius r, with \u1e91\naligned along its axis, following Bean [21], the irreversible\nmagnetization becomes\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(\u2206H)2\n(\u2206H)3\n.\n(9)\nMirr = \u2212\u03c7irr \u2206H \u2212\n+\nH\u2217\n3H \u22172\nThis region is identified by point '1' in Fig. 1. In this\nmodel, H \u2217 is the characteristic coercion field while \u03c7irr H \u2217\nis the maximum magnetic field that can be screened\nwithin the sample. When \u2206H = H \u2217 , corresponding to\npoint '2' in Fig. 1, the irreversible magnetization reaches\nits saturation limit for a cylindrical sample,\nMirr =\n\n|jc r|\n\u03c7irr H \u2217\n\u1e91.\n=\u2212\n3\n3\n\n(10)\n\nWhen the direction in which the field is changed is reversed at point '3' in Fig. 1, the initial susceptibility\nis, once again, given by Equation (5). A similar cubic\nlaw should apply to that in Equation (9) in the reversal\nstate, but with double the interval in \u2206H being required\n3\n\n\fpotential gradient \u2207(\u2206\u03bc) across the sample, however,\nthe situation where Mirr = 0 can only exist in a narrow\nregion of annular topology within the interior of the sample. The effect should still be observable, however, as\ndrop in the volume-averaged saturation magnetization.\nThis could provide an explanation for the drop in the\nsaturation magnetization observed at intermediate filling\nfactors at the lowest temperatures in Reference [11].\nIn conclusion, I have identified a mechanism for persistent currents in metals in which a CDW (or SDW) phase\ncoexists with a strongly field-dependent orbital magnetization. The magnetic field drives an exchange of carriers between the 1D and 2D Fermi surface sheets, which\nhas the effect of stretching or compressing the CDW (or\nSDW) like a concertina. Persistent currents result when\npinning of the CDW (or SDW) resists the concertinalike motions. The charge polarization field of the pinned\nCDW negates the Hall electric field that would normally\ngive rise to the Hall effect [4]. However, because the\nCDW (or SDW) exists in a critical state on the brink of\nsliding, the magnetic properties resemble those of a type\nII superconductor [21]. Like a superconductor, currents\nexist only because of impurity pinning. The mechanism\nfor persistent currents, described here, however, is neither the quantum Hall effect or superconductivity, but\none that is entirely different. I propose this effect as an\nexplanation for persistent currents observed in \u03b1-(BEDTTTF)2 KHg(SCN)4 [11\u201314].\nThe work is supported by the Department of Energy,\nthe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the State\nof Florida.
