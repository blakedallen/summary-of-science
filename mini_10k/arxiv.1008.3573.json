Fractal dimensions are measured and compared to exact\ntheoretical predictions.\n1. Introduction\nStudy of the fractal geometry of critical interfaces has recently become one of the main areas\nof development in statistical physics. Indeed, the\nSLE (Schramm\u2013L\u00f6wner Evolution) process discovered by O. Schramm [1] is defined in terms of fractal curves. This discovery has led to an explosion\nof rigorous results for statistical models on a plane\n(see for example review [2]).\nPotts model [3] is a generalization of Ising\nmodel where spin variables \u03c3i can possess values\nin {1, 2, . . . , q}. Hamiltonian of the model with\nnearest\u2013neighbor interactions is\nX\n(1)\nJij (\u03b4\u03c3i \u03c3j \u2212 1).\nH=\u2212\n<ij>\n\nWe consider ferromagnetic model with no bond\ndisorder, that is Jij =J>0. It is convenient to\nrewrite partition function as a sum over bond variable configurations {bij }.\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nY\nX\nY\n\uf8ed\np\uf8f8 \uf8ed\nZPotts =\n(1 \u2212 p)\uf8f8 q #c , (2)\n{bij }\n\nbij =1\n\nbij =0\n\nwhere #c is the total number of clusters in the configuration and p=1 \u2212 exp(\u2212\u03b2J). This representation is called Fortuin\u2013Kasteleyn representation [4].\nNote that now q is not restricted to integer values.\nTwo-dimensional (2D) Potts model has a second\norder phase transition for q \u2208 [0; 4]. For greater\nvalues of q phase transition becomes first\u2013order.\nCorrespondence between critical Potts models\nand SLE remains hypothetical (rigorously proved\nPreprint submitted to Computer Physics Communications\n\nby Smirnov only for the case of square\u2013lattice Ising\nmodel [5], for numerical check see [8]). For these\nmodels SLE approach is complementary to older\nand less rigorous Coulomb gas [6] and Conformal\nField Theory [7] methods. Elegant prediction by\nDuplantier [9] (confirmed by SLE, provided there is\ncorrespondence) states that the fractal dimensions\nof boundaries of dF K and their external perimeters\ndEP satisfy duality relation (dF K \u2212 1)(dEP \u2212 1) =\n1/4. This prediction is supported by numerical results presented by Aisikainen et al [10] and by more\nrecent data of Adams et al [11]. For boundaries of\nspin clusters of Ising model Smirnov's paper predicts that their fractal dimension is equal to dEP .\nThe hypothesis [12] that it is true for other values of\nparameter q is supported by recent numerical data\nof Jacobsen et al [13] for q = 3.\nWe present algorithm for identification of percolating boundary of Fortuin\u2013Kasteleyn (FK) clusters, of percolating external perimeter of FK clusters (EP) and percolating boundary of spin clusters\n(SP). Preliminary estimations of fractal dimension\nof critical FK interfaces, EP, and SP interfaces for\nvarious values of q \u2208 [1; 4] are presented.\nIn section 2 we review Monte\u2013Carlo algorithms.\nIn section 3 we proceed with the definitions of clusters, their boundaries. In section 4 we introduce\nalgorithms for finding lengths of interfaces. We conclude with the account of our simulations.\n2. Monte\u2013Carlo algorithms\nWell known algorithms for Monte\u2013Carlo simulations of Potts model with noninteger q include\nJuly 17, 2018\n\n\fChayes\u2013Machta algorithm [14] and Sweeny algorithm [15].\nSweeny algorithm is essentially a Metropolis type\nalgorithm for simulating partition function (2) via\nsingle\u2013bond updates. It is applicable for simulations in the whole range q \u2208 [0, 4]. As this algorithm needs nonlocal information for local updates, its performance depends strongly on the nature of implementation. The original article describes some optimizations for 2D lattice which help\nachieve O(N log N ) performance asymptotic (where\nN = L2 is the number of lattice sites).\nChayes\u2013Machta algorithm is easy to implement,\nsweeps the whole lattice in O(N ) steps and works\nfor q \u2208 [1; 4]. One step of the algorithm proceeds\nas follows:\n\nFigure 1: Example of bond conguration with nontrivial part\nof the boundary of a cluster marked by the line with arrows.\n\nSpin clusters are defined in the following way: let\n\u03c3i be the configuration of spin variables obtained\nwith Chayes\u2013Machta (CM) algorithm. Then, generate bond configuration by setting all bij =1 between sites i, j such that \u03c3i =\u03c3j = 1 and all other\nbij =0. Note that such procedure is equivalent to\nperforming the bond\u2013adding step of CM algorithm\nat zero temperature.\nWhen q is integer, \"active\" sites in CM algorithm\nrepresent sites of one particular Potts color. So for\ninteger q this definition coincides with the regular\none and provides natural extension to noninteger\nvalues of q.\n\n1. Find all bond clusters in the configuration.\n2. Independently label clusters as \"active\" (site\ncolor 1) with probability 1/q or \"inactive\" (site\ncolor 0) with probability (q \u2212 1)/q.\n3. Erase all bonds. Independently with probability p add bonds between sites of active clusters.\nThere is some freedom in which cluster\u2013\nfinding algorithm to use. We used Newman\u2013Ziff\nmethod [16] as it turned out to be slightly superior\nin performance to other methods (e.g. breadth\u2013first\nsearch).\nAs Chayes\u2013Machta algorithm (when it is applicable) generally performs better than Sweeny algorithm, we used it for all our simulations. Additionally, as will be shown later, this algorithm provides\nan idea for the identification of spin cluster applicable to noninteger values of q.\n\n3.2. Cluster boundary\nAny bond configuration induces a configuration\nof closed loops [17] on a medial lattice (sites of the\nmedial lattice are in the middles of the bonds of\nthe original lattice), which is defined for any planar\nlattice. Let us define cluster boundary as the set of\nloops on a medial lattice adjacent to at least one of\nthe sites of the cluster considered.\nOn a lattice with periodic boundary conditions\n(as is indeed the case in our simulations) most of\nthese loops can be contracted into a point by a continuous transformation. But for loops that wind\nnontrivially on the torus of the lattice (we will call\nsuch loops \"nontrivial\") this is not true. We will\nbe interested primarily in nontrivial loops, as they\npossess an unambiguous length scale (namely, lattice size L) and do not disappear in the scaling limit\nas L\u2192\u221e. Example of a cluster with nontrivial part\nof the boundary marked is presented in Fig. 1.\n\n3. Definition of clusters and their interfaces\nOur goal in this section is to provide unified definitions for all the objects considered. Let us start\nwith the definition of clusters.\n3.1. FK and spin clusters\nGiven lattice graph G and bond configuration\nb \u2261 {bij } on it, we call every group of vertices of\nG which is a connected component of b a cluster\nof b. This definition allows us to treat clusters of\ndifferent types merely as clusters on different bond\nconfigurations.\nSpecifically, let bond configuration b be drawn\nfrom the distribution induced by the Fortuin\u2013\nKasteleyn partition function (2). Then, clusters of\nb are called Fortuin\u2013Kasteleyn or FK clusters.\n2\n\n\fk=0\n\nk=1\n\n(0, 0)\n\n(0, 1)\n\nk=2\n\nk=0\n\nk=1\n\n(1, 0)\n\nFigure 2: External perimeter.\n\n(0, 2)\nk=3\n\n(1, 1)\n\n(1, 2)\n\nFigure 3: Tracing the boundary.\n(2, 0)\n\n(2, 1)\n\n(2, 2)\n\nl \u2190 0, wx \u2190 0, wy \u2190 0\ne\u2032 \u2190 e\ndo\nl \u2190l+1\n(wx, wy) \u2190 (wx, wy) + Windings(e)\ne\u2032 \u2190 NextLink(e\u2032 )\nwhile e\u2032 6= e\nreturn (l, wx, wy)\n\n3.3. External perimeter\nFor any cluster c with a nontrivial boundary let\nus set all bond variables bij =1 for all neighboring\nsites i, j\u2208c such that there is a loop adjacent to both\ni and j. As a result the initial cluster boundary is\nsplit into trivial loops (which encircle fjords that\nbecome \"lakes\") and two nontrivial parts. We will\ncall them the external perimeter of a cluster. External perimeter for the cluster in Fig. 1 is presented\non Fig. 2.\nThe definition makes use of the fact that the loop\nis \"internal\" iff it is trivial. For other types of\nboundary condition one has to come up with some\nother method for distinguishing between internal\nand external loops.\nAccording to this definition only the fjords with\nthe narrowest entrances (the ones one lattice spacing wide) are closed. Our simulations suggest that\nit is sufficient to achieve the expected fractal dimension, although one could in principle define the\nwhole hierarchy of external perimeters as was found\nin [18].\nNote also that according to presented definition\nexternal perimeter of a spin cluster coincides with\nits regular outer boundary.\n\nFigure 4: TraceLoop(e)\n\nThe state of a walker is a tuple e = (i, j, k) representing the segment of a medial lattice. Here (i, j)\nare the lattice coordinates and k \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3} is\nthe index of the segment (see Fig. 3). Procedure\nNextSegment(e) finds next to e segment in a loop\nto which e belongs. If the corresponding bond ending in (i, j) is not present, NextSegment(i, j, k) =\n(i, j, (k + 1)%4), where % represents taking a\nremainder. If the bond is present, then e.g.\nNextSegment(i, j, 2) = ((i + 1)%L, j, 1). For other\ncases NextSegment is defined analogously. Note\nthat to trace spin cluster boundaries instead of FK\none does not need to construct another configuration but only tell the walker that the bond is present\nif respective sites are both active.\nProcedure TraceLoop(e) (Fig. 4) returns the tuple (l, wx, wy), where l is the length the loop containing e and wx, wy are the number of times the\nloop winds around the lattice in both directions.\nWindings(e) returns (0, 0) for a segment in the\nbulk and one of {(1, 0), (\u22121, 0), (0, 1), (0, \u22121)} if the\nwalker needs to cross the edge of the lattice in a\ncorresponding direction. The loop is nontrivial iff\n(wx, wy) 6= (0, 0) (note that the mere fact that the\nwalker crosses the lattice edge is insufficient).\nProcedure FindNontrivialLoops() (Fig. 5) finds\n\n4. Algorithms for tracing boundaries\nThe main purpose of the algorithms in this section is to find lengths of cluster boundaries and\ntheir external perimeters given the configuration\n({bij }, {si }). In the basis of all these algorithms\nlies a lattice walker which traces loops on a medial\nlattice, with one segment at a time. We will present\ndefinitions for a square lattice as generalizations to\narbitrary planar lattice are straightforward.\n3\n\n\fq\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\n\ndth\nFK\n1.75\n1.70444\n5/3\n1.63274\n1.6\n1.56498\n1.5\n\nmeasured\n1.75002(2)\n1.70449(7)\n1.6667(1)\n1.63275(8)\n1.6002(1)\n1.565(2)\n1.534(1)\n\ndth\nEP\n4/3\n1.35489\n1.375\n1.39511\n1.41667\n1.44248\n1.5\n\nmeasured\n1.33331(9)\n1.3546(2)\n1.3747(5)\n1.3953(9)\n1.418(1)\n1.438(4)\n1.405(1)\n\ndth\nspin\n\u2013\n1.35489\n1.375\n1.39511\n1.41667\n1.44248\n1.5\n\nmeasured\n\u2013\n1.3549(2)\n1.37514(8)\n1.3946(3)\n1.418(1)\n1.46(2)\n1.428(1)\n\nTable 1: Fractal dimensions: theoretical predictions and measured values.\n\nlengths \u2190 \u2205\nfor e \u2208 loops do\nfor e\u2032 \u2208 LoopExits(e) do\n(l, wx, wy) \u2190 TraceEP(e\u2032 )\nif wx 6= 0 or wy 6= 0 then\nlengths \u2190 lengths \u222a l\nend if\nend for\nend for\nreturn lengths\n\nClearLabels()\nloops \u2190 \u2205\nlabel \u2190 1\nfor e \u2208 Exits do\nif Label(e) = 0 then\n(l, wx, wy) \u2190 TraceLoop(e)\nLabelLoop(e, label)\nlabel \u2190 label + 1\nif wx 6= 0 or wy 6= 0 then\nloops \u2190 loops \u222a e\nend if\nend if\nend for\nreturn loops\n\nFigure 6: FindEPLengths(loops)\n\nNextEPSegment(e) and TraceEP(e) defined analogously to NextSegment and TraceLoop only in such\nway that bonds added according to the definition\nof external perimeter are taken into account (again,\nno modification of configuration is necessary). The\nfact that the loop segments are still labeled after\nthe run of FindNontrivialLoops greatly helps in\nrecognizing gates to the fjords.\nNow finding the length of the external perimeter\nis easy (Fig. 6).\nProcessing a configuration with these algorithms\nrequires O(N ) steps.\n\nFigure 5: FindNontrivialLoops()\n\nthe set of all nontrivial loops in the configuration.\nThe subset of boundary segments\nExits = {(i, j, k) : i=0, 0<j<L, k\u2208{0, 1}}\u222a\n{(i, j, k) : 0<i<L, j=0, k\u2208{1, 2}} (3)\nis chosen in such way that any nontrivial loop has a\nsegment in this subset. A naive way to find nontrivial loops would be to launch TraceLoop for all segments in Exits. But, as one loop can cross Exits\nmany times, this leads to much worse than O(N )\nperformance. To avoid this we mark all already\ntraced loops with an unique label. ClearLabels\nsets all the labels to zero.\nSearch for external perimeters is performed only\nfor a configuration with nonempty loops set. For\nall e\u2208loops define the set\n\n5. Simulation and results\nWe simulated 2D Potts model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and q \u2208\n{1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4}. For pseudorandom number generation Mersenne Twister algorithm [19]\n(MT19937) was used. For each value of q lattices of\nlinear size L from 32 to 1323 were simulated. For\neach lattice size we performed 150 to 1000 independent runs. One independent run started with a\nthermalization period of 2 * 104 Monte\u2013Carlo steps.\nIt was followed by 105 steps during each of which\nthe configuration was searched for nontrivial inter-\n\nLoopExits(e) =\nExits \u2229 {e\u2032 : e\u2032 = NextSegmentn (e)}\n\n(4)\n\nof all segments of loop represented by e which\nare also in Exits.

We tried to\nfit with analytical correction first, discarding data\npoints with small L until satisfactory \u03c72 per degree\nof freedom was obtained. If this procedure was unsuccessful, function (6) was used.\nResults are presented in Table 1. Except q = 4,\nthey are in close agreement with theoretical predictions. The reason for the discrepancy at q = 4\nis that main correction term becomes logarithmic,\nwhich is very difficult to properly take into account.\nReferences\n[1] O.
