Here, we correct our earlier description of this problem by\nconsidering the progressive nature of the suction process. We find that the critical current for\npenetration, Jc , is controlled by the entry of a single blob of the capillary size, and that its\nscaling structure is the same for branched and linear chains.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 Confined polymer chains show up in many sectors ranging from filtration\nproblems to DNA permeation [1]. In good solvent conditions, the concentration of linear chains\nin a pore smaller than the coil size, in equilibrium with a dilute bulk solution, is exponentially\nsmall [2]. However, the chain may be sucked in the pore by a flow (with an overall current J)\nif the current is beyond a certain threshold given by [3]:\nJc \u2243 kB T /\u03b7\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b7 is the solvent viscosity and kB T is the thermal energy. Note that this critical current\nis independent of both the molecular weight of the chains and the capillary size.\nTen years ago, some of us tried to extend this discussion to the case of branched chains [3, 4].\nThe hope was that the threshold current could bring new informations on the properties of\nbranched objects. It turns out, however, that our discussion was incorrect! The purpose of\nthe present letter is to improve on that.\nThe incorrect result was based on an \"inside approach\", where the confined chain is considered independently of the entry. The implicit assumption was that the structure of a partly\nsucked chain may be represented by that of a completely confined chain.\nBelow, after recalling some basic conformational principles of branched polymers, we summarize the earlier argument and show its weakness. We then present a Flory type argument\nfor a partly sucked branched chain and discuss the progressive nature of the confining process.\nc EDP Sciences\n\n\f2\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nStatics of branched polymers. \u2013 We start with a branched polymer made up of N\nmonomers of size a, in solution in a good solvent. We assume the molecule to be flexible,\nand characterized by a tree-like structure with no loops. The ideal size (i.e. the size without\nvolume interactions) of such an object is given by R0 \u2243 aN 1/4 [5]. The chain swelling due\nto excluded volume interactions can be derived using a Flory type argument as follows [6, 7].\nThe free energy of the branched chain with size R is\nF\nN 2 a3\nR2\n\u2243 2+\nkB T\nR0\nR3\n\n(2)\n\nThe first term is an elastic term, and the second term comes from the intermonomer repulsions.\nMinimizing Eq.(2) with respect to R yields the equilibrium size of the chain:\nR \u2243 aN 1/2\n\n(3)\n\nWhen such a branched object is confined into a capillary of size D < R, its conformational\nproperties are significantlly altered [8] and the chain is extended over a length L along the\ncapillary axis. The Flory free energy of the chain is now given by:\nF\nN 2 a3\nL2\n\u2243 2+\nkB T\nR0\nLD2\n\n(4)\n\nMinimizing Eq.(4) with respect to L yields:\n\u0010 a \u00115/3\nL\n\u2243\nN 5/6\nD\nD\n\n(5)\n\nThe confined branched object is reminiscent of semidilute solutions and can be seen as a\ncompact stacking of blobs of size \u03be with a number of monomers g [4, 3]. Inside a blob, the\neffect of confinement is negligible, and \u03be and g are related by \u03be = ag 1/2 (see Eq.(3)). Since\nthe blobs are compactly stacked, \u03be and g must also satisfy the relation \u03c6 \u2243 ga3 /\u03be 3 , where \u03c6\nis the volume fraction given by \u03c6 \u2243 N a3 /LD2 . From the above equations we obtain for the\nmesh size\n\u0012 \u00131/5\n\u0012 \u00134/3\nD\nD\nN \u22121/6 \u2243 D\n(6)\n\u03be\u2243a\na\nL\nFor D \u2243 R, we have \u03be \u2243 R. Note also that \u03c6 \u2243 1, \u03be \u2243 a and L \u2243 aN 3/4 for D \u2243 aN 1/8 (this\nlatter value is called the minimum diameter [8]).\nEarlier approach. \u2013 In this section, we briefly review the earlier \"inside approach\" for\nthe flow injection of branched polymers [3, 4, 9]. Let us consider the situation in which part of\nthe polymer chain is located inside a pore of diameter D (with D < aN 1/2 , see Fig. 1)). The\nlength of the pore occupied by the chain is denoted by y. The free energy, F (y), associated\nwith the confined part of the chain is given by\nZ y\nF (y) = fconf y \u2212\nfhyd (y)dy\n(7)\n0\n\nIn the above equation, the force due to the confinement is\nfconf \u2243\n\nkB T 2\nD\n\u03be3\n\n(8)\n\n\fTakahiro Sakaue, Elie Rapha\u00ebl, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes and Fran\u00e7oise Brochard-Wyart: Flow-injection of branched p\n\n\u03be\n\nD\n\ny\nFig. 1 \u2013 A partly injected polymer inside a narrow capillary. A part inside the capillary is a dense\npiling of blobs of size \u03be.\n\nThe hydrodynamic force fhyd can be estimated as a Stokes drag per blob. Assuming that y\nis larger than the blob size, we get\nfhyd \u2243 \u03b7 \u03be v(D)\n\nD2 y\n\u03be3\n\n(9)\n\nwhere v(D) = J/(\u03c0D2 ) is the local solvent velocity inside the capillary and (D2 y)/\u03be 3 is the\nnumber of blobs injected.

Therefore,\nthe critical current Jc for a branched polymer is predicted to be given by [4]:\n\u03b7\nkB T\n\nJc \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\nD\n\u03be\n\n\u00134\n\n(13)\n\nUsing Eq.(6), Eq.(13) can be rewritten as\n\u03b7\nkB T\n\nJc \u2243\n\n\u0010 a \u00114/3\nD\n\nN 2/3\n\n(14)\n\nwhich indicates that the larger branched polymer would be injected into smaller pore with\nmore difficulties.\n\n\f4\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nEquation (13), (14) were the main predictions of ref. [4], but they are incorrect for the\nfollowing reason. The threshold length y \u2217 corresponding to J = Jc is given by (see Eqs.(12,13))\n\u2217\n\u2243\nyJ=J\nc\n\n\u03be3\nD2\n\n(15)\n\n\u2217\nEquation.(15) indicates that yJ=J\n< \u03be. But at y < \u03be, the polymer does not feel yet the effect\nc\nof the confinement at all ! This contradiction clearly indicates that the assumption that \u03be is\nidentical to the equilibrium mesh size of an entirely confined chain is incorrect.\nAs we will now show, the mesh size \u03be depends in fact on the degree of penetration, y, and\ncan be calculated based on a Flory method for a finite piece of chain.\n\nFlory approach for a partly sucked branched chain. \u2013 We now focus our attention to the\nsuction process. The statistical properties of a partly sucked branched object can be discribed\nbased on a Flory type of calculation.\nThe procedure is the same as the case for the completely confined chain, except for the\npoint that now only a part of the chain (with the number of monomers P < N ) is inside the\ncapillary. The sucked part of the chain is extended over a length y along the tube and its\ndegree of extension can be derived from the optimization of the following free energy.\nF\nP 2 a3\ny2\n+\n\u2243 2\nkB T\nR0(P )\nyD2\n\n(16)\n\n2\n1/4\nwhere R0(P\nis the size of an ideal branched chain made from P monomers.

It is important to note that the mesh size \u03be(y) is a decreasing function of y. This\nmeans that the branched object is progressively compressed during the confinement process\n(Fig. 2).\nWith progressive confining in mind, we now return to our discussion of suction process.\nWe may still use the \"inside\" discription of eq.

(7)-(9) are therefore meaningful. From eq. (21) and (22),\nwe find that the critical current Jc for branched chains is still given by the scaling form of\neq. (1): we expect no dramatic difference between branched chains and linear chains.\nDiscussion. \u2013 We have shown that the scaling structure of the critical current for penetration, Jc , is the same for branched and linear chains. Though suprizing, this result can be\nexplained physically. Our argument indicates that the crucial moment is the insertion of a\nsingle blob of the capillary size. We might ask whether more resistance comes out from the\nsecond, third blob... The crucial physical feature is a runaway: starting from one blob, if we\ngo to higher value of y, the hydrodynamic drag increases faster with y than the confinement\nforce. This can be checked in detail starting from Eqs. (7 - 9), and allowing \u03bein to depend on\ny (eq. (18)). Such a feature is associated with the progressive nature of the confining process\nof branched objects into the capillary (Fig. 2)(1 ). Thus, as soon as one blob has entered the\ncapillary, the whole structure should get sucked in.\nFrom a practical point of view, we now expect that Jc is not sensitive to branching (except\nfor numerical coefficients which go beyond scaling). Our hope of probing branched structure\nby suction experiments is thus destroyed. However, for more complicated structures (stars,\nnanogels), the suction process may be interesting. This is discussed in a separated paper by\none of us (T.S.).\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\nT.S. was supported by a Research Fellowship from the Japan Society for the Promotion\nof Science for Young Scientists (No. 4990).\n(1 )We note that a branched polymer in a capillary is not an exceptional case. As a simple example, a linear\nchain in a closed cavity shows physically same behaviours. The corresponding confinement regime may be\ncalled as strong confinement and should be distinguished from weak confinement regime, where the mesh size\ndoes not depend on the degree of confinement [10].\n\n\f6\n\nEUROPHYSICS LETTERS\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] J.J.
