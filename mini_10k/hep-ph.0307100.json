An opinion\nexists that there are no other vector particles besides the\ngauge ones. They have only chirality conserved vector\ninteractions with the matter fields. The so called anomalous term, which appears from radiative corrections [1], is\nsmall and is not present in the initial Lagrangian. It describes chirality flipped interactions with the tensor current.\nAlthough the gluons are gauge particles, they induce\nchirality violation and, therefore, in the hadron physics\nthe anomalous interactions of the vector mesons are not\nso small. They should be taken into account, for example to extract |Vub | element of CKM matrix from the\nsemileptonic decay B \u2192 \u03c1l\u03bd. Even more peculiar is the\nexistence of the vector b1 (1235) meson with only anomalous interactions with quarks. It is not possible at all to\ndescribe this meson as a gauge particle.\nSuch kind of particles originate from a tensor formalism. It is known that free relativistic particles with spin 1\ncan be described by the four-vector A\u03bc or by the second\nrank antisymmetric tensor field T\u03bc\u03bd . These two different descriptions are applied to the vector mesons without noting the main difference between them [2]. However, the different formalisms are related to the different couplings of the vector mesons to the quarks and,\ntherefore, to the different chiral properties. The vector\nfields are transformed under real (chirally neutral) representation (1/2,1/2) of the Lorentz group. On the other\nhand T\u03bc\u03bd \u00b1 iT\u0303\u03bc\u03bd combinations are transformed under irreducible chiral representations (1,0) and (0,1). They\ndescribe chiral vector fields.\nThe aim of this letter is to put on the same footing\n(at least at a phenomenological level) the consideration\nof the gauge particles and the particles with anomalous\nonly interactions. The successful description of the dynamical properties of the hadron systems hints that the\nsame phenomenon takes place in the high energy physics\n\ntoo. Then we may expect the discovery of anomalously\ninteracting particles at future colliders.\nThe Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (NJL) [3] quark model is a\nsuccessful tool for investigating hadron physics and the\nspontaneous chiral symmetry breaking mechanism. However, an extension of the model is needed [4] in order to\nintroduce the new type anomalous interactions and the\nparticles associated with them .\nTo simplify the idea we will deal only with the oneflavor NJL model. The generalization for the real case\nwith N flavors is straightforward and will be considered\nelsewhere. As long as the isospin triplet I = 1 consists of\nup and down quarks with approximately the same constituent masses, we can apply this one-flavor model to\nthe vector mesons \u03c1, b1 , a1 and \u03c1\u2032 . Using this approach\nwe will get, for example,\nvery simple prediction for the\n\u221a\nratio f\u03c1T /f\u03c1 \u2243 1/ 2, which matches very well the latest\nlattice calculations [5].\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nFollowing the classical paper [3] we start with the chiral\ninvariant Lagrangian\n\u0001\n\u0001\nG0\n\u03c8\u0304 1 + \u03b3 5 \u03c8 \u03c8\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 \u03c8\nL=\n\u03c8\u0304q/\u03c8 +\n2\n\u00012 GA\n\u00012\nGV\n\u2212\n\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8 \u2212\n\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03c8\n2\n2\n\u0001\n\u0001\nq\u03bc q\u03bd\nGT\n\u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bb 1 + \u03b3 5 \u03c8 2 \u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bd\u03bb 1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 \u03c8 (1)\n\u2212\n2\nq\nwhere the new tensor interaction term was introduced.\nIt should contain an unique momentum dependence, because the local product of two tensor currents with different chiralities vanishes identically. Generally speaking,\nthere are four different positive coupling parameters G0 ,\nGV , GA and GT with dimensions [mass]\u22122 for each chiral\ninvariant term.\nLet us rewrite the Lagrangian (1) by introducing auxiliary bosonic fields (without kinetic terms) which will\n\n\f2\nlater play the role of collective meson states after quantization\nL=\n\ng2\ng\u03c32 2\n\u03c3 + ig\u03c0 \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 5\u03c8\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u03c0 2\n2G0\n2G0\ngV2\ng2\n+ gV \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8V\u03bc +\nV\u03bc2 + gA \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3 5\u03c8A\u03bc + A A2\u03bc\n2GV\n2GA\n2\nq\u03bc\ngR\n\u2212 igR \u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8\nR2\nR\u03bd +\n|q|\n2GT \u03bc\nq\u03bc\ng2\n(2)\nB\u03bd + B B\u03bc2 ,\n+ gB \u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03b3 5\u03c8\n|q|\n2GT\n\u03c8\u0304q/\u03c8 + g\u03c3 \u03c8\u0304\u03c8\u03c3 \u2212\n\nwhere ga (a = \u03c3, \u03c0, V, A, R, B) are dimensionless coupling\nconstants. At the classical level the Lagrangians (1) and\n(2) are equivalent. However, the perturbation quantum\nfield theory cannot be applied in the former case due to\nthe dimensional constants G. Therefore, the second form\nof the Lagrangian with dimensionless coupling constants\nga is more appropriate for quantization by perturbative\nmethods [6].\nIII.\n\nQUANTUM CORRECTIONS AND\nSYMMETRY BREAKING\n\nIt is interesting to note that in spite of absence of\nkinetic terms for the meson fields in the initial Lagrangian (2) they are generated on the quantization stage\ndue to radiative corrections (Fig. 1a).

The axial-vector mesons A\u03bc also\nget additional contribution to their mass terms.\nThe essential feature of eq. (4) is the mixing between\nthe two vector mesons V\u03bc and R\u03bc which have the same\nquantum numbers as \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 mesons. In the Lorentz\ngauge this reads\n\u221a\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nq \u2212 MV2\nV\u03bc\n18m|q|\nLV R = \u2212 (V\u03bc R\u03bc ) \u221a\n(5)\nR\u03bc\n18m|q| q 2 \u2212 MR2\n2\n\nIf we identify the physical states with quantum numbers\n1\u2212\u2212 with these mesons, they can be expressed as linear\ncombinations of the chiral eigenstates V\u03bc and R\u03bc\n\u03c1\u03bc (q 2 ) =\n\ncos \u03b8(q 2 )V\u03bc + sin \u03b8(q 2 )R\u03bc\n\n\u03c1\u2032\u03bc (q 2 ) = \u2212 sin \u03b8(q 2 )V\u03bc + cos \u03b8(q 2 )R\u03bc ,\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nof our model:\n\nwhere\np\n72m2 q 2\n2\ntan 2\u03b8(q ) = 2\n.\nMR \u2212 MV2\n\n(7)\n\nf a1 =\n\nIt means that \u03c1 and \u03c1 mesons have both vector and\nanomalous tensor couplings with quarks, while the axialvector mesons a1 with quantum numbers 1++ , which are\nassigned to A\u03bc , have only gauge-like minimal interactions and the axial-vector mesons b1 with quantum numbers 1+\u2212 , which are assigned to B\u03bc , have only anomalous\ntensor interactions.\nDiagonalization of (5) leads to relations for the physical\nmasses of \u03c1, \u03c1\u2032 and b1 mesons [7]: m\u03c1 = 771.1 \u00b1 0.9 MeV,\nm\u03c1\u2032 = 1465 \u00b1 25 MeV and mb1 = 1229.5 \u00b1 3.2 MeV:\nm2\u03c1 + m2\u03c1\u2032 = MV2 + m2b1 + 6m2\n\u0001\nm2\u03c1 m2\u03c1\u2032 = MV2 m2b1 \u2212 12m2 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhich define MV = 1034 \u00b1 33 MeV and the quark mass\nm = 163 \u00b1 7 MeV.\nIn general, the mixing angle \u03b8 depends on q 2 (7) and\nshould be different at \u03c1- and \u03c1\u2032 -scale. However, the denominator in (7) is smaller in comparison with the nominator and tan 2\u03b8(q 2 ) = |q|/(89+82\n\u221275 MeV) is big, which corresponds to almost maximal mixing \u03b8 \u223c \u03c0/4 with weak\nq 2 -dependence.\nIf we suppose, that the effective four-fermion interactions of quarks (1) could originate in QCD by gluon\nexchange in 1/Nc limit, it follows MV = MA [8]. Then\nfrom the first equation in (8) a remarkable relation among\nmasses of the vector mesons is obtained\nm2\u03c1 + m2\u03c1\u2032 = m2a1 + m2b1 .\n\n(9)\n\nThis leads to a little bit smaller value for the mass of a1\nmeson ma1 = 1109 \u00b1 37 MeV (2.2\u03c3 below PDG estimation).\n\nIV. LONGITUDINAL AND TRANSVERSE\nPOLARIZATIONS OF THE VECTOR MESONS\n\nThe longitudinal and transverse polarizations of the\n(axial-)vector mesons are defined by corresponding couplings f from the matrix elements\nh0|\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03c8|A(q, \u03bb)i = mA fA e\u03bb\u03bc\n\nh0|\u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8|A(q, \u03bb)i = ifAT \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 e\u03bb\u03b1 q\u03b2\nh0|\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8|V (q, \u03bb)i =\n\nh0|\u03c8\u0304\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c8|V (q, \u03bb)i =\n\n\u0001\n\u2212 e\u03bb\u03bd q\u03bc ,\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere e\u03bb\u03bc is the polarization vector of a spin-1 meson.\nThen, using the meson-fermion couplings (2) and taking\ninto account the mixing after the symmetry breaking (6),\nwe can express the couplings f in terms of the parameters\n\nf\u03c1 =\nf\u03c1T =\nf\u03c1\u2032 =\nf\u03c1T\u2032 =\n\nfaT1 = 0;\n\nmb1\n;\ngB\n\u221a\nm\u03c1 cos \u03b8(m\u03c1 ) + 18m sin \u03b8(m\u03c1 )\n,\ngV\n\u221a\nm\u03c1 sin \u03b8(m\u03c1 ) + 18m cos \u03b8(m\u03c1 )\n;\ngR\n\u221a\n\u2212m\u03c1\u2032 sin \u03b8(m\u03c1\u2032 ) + 18m cos \u03b8(m\u03c1\u2032 )\n,\ngV\n\u221a\nm\u03c1\u2032 cos \u03b8(m\u03c1\u2032 ) \u2212 18m sin \u03b8(m\u03c1\u2032 )\n;\ngR\n\nfb1 = 0,\n\n\u2032\n\nmV fV e\u03bb\u03bc\nifVT e\u03bb\u03bc q\u03bd\n\nm a1\n,\ngA\n\nfbT1 =\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nwhere ga obey the relations (3).\nWe can make immediately simple qualitative predictions, using the interesting fact that the solution of the\nsystem (8) is very close to the unique solution when the\nmixing angle \u03b8 equals \u03c0/4 and does not depend on q 2 .\nThis happens when MR2 = MV2 . In this case some valuable mass relations, besides (9), have place\n\u221a\nm\u03c1\u2032 = m\u03c1 + 18m\n3m2b1 = 2m2\u03c1\u2032 \u2212 m\u03c1 m\u03c1\u2032 + 2m2\u03c1\n\n3m2a1 = m2\u03c1\u2032 + m\u03c1 m\u03c1\u2032 + m2\u03c1 .\n\n(16)\n\nThe first two relations based only on the suggestion of\nmaximal mixing, while the last one requires of the additional constraint MV = MA . Using more precise mass\nvalues for \u03c1 and b1 mesons [7], we can predict other\nmasses based solely on this ansatz: ma1 = 1155.1 \u00b1 2.7\nMeV, m\u03c1\u2032 = 1500.5 \u00b1 4.8 MeV and m = 171.9 \u00b1 1.3 MeV.\nIt is interesting to note that the second relation can be\napplied to the spin-1 isosinglets I = 0 \u03c9(782), \u03c9 \u2032 (1420),\nh1 (1170) and \u03c6(1020),\u221a\u03c6\u2032 (1680), h1 (1380) which are al \u0304\n2 and ss\u0304 states correspondingly.\nmost pure (u\u016b + dd)/\nIn the first case the mass relation among \u03c9's and h1 is\nfair satisfied. In the second case we can confirm existence\nof h1 (1380) state which is omitted from summary table.\nOur prediction for the mass mh1 (1380) = 1415 \u00b1 13 MeV\nagrees with PDG average mh1 (1380) = 1386 \u00b1 19 MeV.\nIn the case of the maximal mixing the eqs. (14) and\n(15) can be rewritten in a compact form\nm\u03c1\u2032\nm\u03c1\u2032\nf\u03c1 = \u221a\n,\nf\u03c1T = \u221a\n;\n(17)\n2gV\n2gR\nm\u03c1\nm\u03c1\n,\nf\u03c1T\u2032 = \u221a\n;\n(18)\nf\u03c1\u2032 = \u2212 \u221a\n2gV\n2gR\n\u221a\nAs far as gR = 2gV eq. (17) leads\ndirectly to a pre\u221a\ndiction for the ratio f\u03c1T /f\u03c1 = 1/ 2 \u2248 .707, which is in\nperfect agreement with the latest lattice calculations [5].\nThe analogous ratio for the \u03c1\u2032 meson should have\nthe\n\u221a\nsame value and an opposite sign f\u03c1T\u2032 /f\u03c1\u2032 = \u22121/ 2. Unfortunately, there are no lattice calculations for the \u03c1\u2032\nmeson yet.\n\n\f4\nThe another reliable method, giving the information\nabout the matrix elements, is the QCD sum rules [9]. If\none accepts the experimental value for the vector coupling f\u03c1 = 208 \u00b1 10 MeV [5] the QCD sum rules give\ncompatible with lattice calculation result f\u03c1T = 160 \u00b1\n10 MeV [10]. It is interesting to note that the consideration of the correlation function of the tensor with the\nvector current proves that the relative sign of f\u03c1T and f\u03c1 is\npositive [11]. Moreover, it was shown [12] that the contribution of \u03c1\u2032 meson to this correlation function is negative\nand m\u03c1 f\u03c1 f\u03c1T \u2243 \u22122m\u03c1\u2032 f\u03c1\u2032 f\u03c1T\u2032 . That is in a good accordance with our predictions (17,18), since m\u03c1\u2032 \u2243 2m\u03c1 .\nThe derivation of the transverse couplings within the\nQCD sum rules framework has been re-estimated in [13]:\nf\u03c1T = 157 \u00b1 5 MeV and fbT1 = 184 \u00b1 5 MeV, confirming\nthe results of [10]. In addition the \u03c1\u2032 -transverse coupling\nf\u03c1T\u2032 = 140\u00b15 MeV has been evaluated, which is, however,\nin contradiction with the superconvergence relation\nf\u03c1T\n\n\u00012\n\n+ f\u03c1T\u2032\n\n\u00012\n\n= fbT1\n\n\u00012\n\n(19)\n\nfrom [14].\nIt should be compared with our predictions for the\nsame couplings: f\u03c1T = (0.703+0.004\n\u22120.007 )f\u03c1 = 146 \u00b1 7 MeV,\nfbT1 = (0.839+0.017\n)f\n=\n175\n\u00b1 9 MeV and f\u03c1T\u2032 =\n\u22120.015 \u03c1\n(0.405+0.040\n\u22120.034 )f\u03c1 = 84 \u00b1 9 MeV. The first two of them\nare in good agreement with all QCD sum rules results,\nwhile the last one for the \u03c1\u2032 meson is in a good accordance\nwith the relation (19), but it is in noticeable disagreement\nwith [13].\nIt is worth noticing that the anomalous dimension of\nthe tensor current is not zero and the couplings f T (\u03bc)\nare scale dependent. Our values are systematically\nlower than QCD estimations made at the renormalization scale \u03bc = 1 GeV and closer to lattice calculations at\n\u03bc = 2 GeV.\n\npseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and antisymmetric tensor. They have corresponding Yukawa interactions with\nquarks. All these excitations are assigned to physical\nmeson states \u03c3, \u03c0, \u03c1, a1 , \u03c1\u2032 and b1 . The (pseudo)scalar\nsector was already well studied and introduction of the\ntensor bosons does not bring anything new there. Hence,\nwe have concentrated on the spin-1 meson sector mainly.\nSimultaneous description of all these states in the\nframework of NJL model leads to interesting predictions\nlike new mass formulas and relations among meson coupling constants. All these relations are in agreement with\npresent experimental data and the numerical calculations\non the lattice and the QCD sum rules.\nOther interesting property which follows immediately\nfrom our approach is the dual nature of \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 mesons.\nThey have both vector and tensor couplings with quarks.\nThe new insight on this phenomenon is the suggestion\nthat there exist two different vector particles with the\nsame quantum numbers, which interact differently with\nquarks. One of them has only gauge-like vector interactions and the other one has only anomalous tensor interactions. After the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking they are mixed, producing the physical \u03c1 and \u03c1\u2032 meson states. From the hadron phenomenology point of\nview this suggestion does not seem unnatural, because\nthe axial-vector mesons a1 and b1 , due to their different\nquantum numbers, exist as pure states, which have correspondingly only gauge-like couplings and tensor couplings with quarks.\nThe above consideration means that in Nature there\nexist two different vector particles with respect to their\ninteractions with matter. However, they are just composite quark-antiquark states. The question, if there are new\nfundamental vector particles, will be probably answered\nat the future colliders and especially at LHC.\nAcknowledgments\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this letter we followed an approach based on the extended NJL quark model, describing all low-lying meson\nresonances.
