Here, we give local realistic explanations for these experiments. More\nprecisely, we examine the scenario where a participant swaps his entanglement with\ntwo other participants and then is removed from the experiment; we also examine\nthe scenario where two particles are in the same light cone, i.e. belong to a single\nparticipant.

Stapp [1] once described the work of John S. Bell [2] as \"the most profound discovery\nof science\". Indeed, the work of Bell showed that our intuition that the world should be\nlocal realistic is incorrect, thus changing our perception of the physical world, perhaps to\nthe same extent as Isaac Newton's work on classical dynamics and Albert Einstein's work\non relativity. Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (EPR), defenders of the\nlocal realistic viewpoint, argued that quantum mechanics is not a complete theory for it\n1\n\n\fdoes not contain every element of physical reality in its formalism [3]. Bell showed that\nthese exact same elements of reality, weaved into a local model of Nature, lead to a theory\nwhich contradicts the predictions of quantum mechanics. The experimental verification of\nBell's predictions [4, 5] gives us strong evidence that Nature indeed does not have a local\nrealistic description.\nMore recently, a new kind of refutation of the local realistic viewpoint has\narisen [6, 7, 8, 9]. These local-hidden-variable no-go theorems are also called \"Bell theorems\nwithout inequalities\". Like standard Bell theorems, these experiments must be repeated for\nmany runs in order to rule out a local realistic viewpoint (if we observe a single successful\nrun, we cannot conclude anything except maybe that quantum mechanics is right or that a\nlocal-hidden-variable (LHV) model was lucky!) but usually less runs are required in order to\nreach the same confidence level as for standard Bell theorems. Another advantage is that the\nproof that no LHV model can reproduce the quantum correlations is usually much more elegant and simple. Instead of only showing that no LHV model can reproduce the correlations\npredicted by quantum mechanics (as is the case for standard Bell theorems), Bell theorems\nwithout inequalities show that an LHV model which is to attempt a simulation of quantum\nmechanics will run into a contradiction with itself [10]. Most of these Bell theorems can be\nrecast into the framework of pseudo-telepathy [11, 12]. In the pseudo-telepathy paradigm,\nproofs of non-locality are presented in the form of games. These games consist of questions\ngiven to space-like separated players who must give answers satisfying a certain relation with\nthe questions. We say that a game which cannot be won with certainty by classical players\n(who share common classical information), whereas it can be won with certainty by quantum\nplayers (who share entanglement), is a pseudo-telepathy game. In other words, any LHV\nmodel that is to attempt to simulate the quantum correlations will, once in a while, output\nsomething that is forbidden according to quantum mechanics. There exists a Bell theorem\nwithout inequalities that cannot be transformed into pseudo-telepathy: Lucien Hardy's theorem [9]. Hardy's argument uses a pair of non-maximally entangled qubits, and such a state\ncannot produce correlations that yield a pseudo-telepathy game [13].\nIn the last few months, new scenarios that can be cast into the framework of two-player\npseudo-telepathy games have been proposed [14, 15, 16, 17]. The authors claim that they\npresent new proofs against local realism. Although the equations that they present are\nmathematically correct, it is not possible to interpret them in such a way as to rule out all\nLHV models for the proposed experiments. Our work aims to clarify this situation. The\npresent paper is divided such that we first discuss candidates for pseudo-telepathy games that\nuse entanglement swapping in Section II. In Section III, we analyse the treatment of LHVs\nwhich are time-like separated. Before concluding, we finish with a discussion on elements of\nreality in Bell experiments in Section IV.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nEntanglement swapping\n\nDaniel M. Greenberger, Michael A. Horne and Anton Zeilinger [14, 15], recently proposed\nschemes based on entanglement swapping that fit in the framework of pseudo-telepathy.\nHere, we present a simple proof that shows that there is an LHV model for any twoparticipant protocol based on entanglement swapping. Thus, without going into the details\nof the scheme, we show that the experiment of Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger cannot rule\nout local realism. Afterwards, we show that even if we consider the three-participant version\nof the Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger protocol, it still admits an LHV model.\nRecall that the following are the four Bell states:\n|\u03c8 \u2212 i = \u221a12 |01i \u2212\n\n|\u03c8 + i = \u221a12 |01i +\n\n|\u03c6\u2212 i = \u221a12 |00i \u2212\n\n|\u03c6+ i = \u221a12 |00i +\n\n\u221a1 |10i,\n2\n\u221a1 |10i,\n2\n\u221a1 |11i,\n2\n\u221a1 |11i.\n2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nIn the entanglement swapping scheme, Bob shares a copy of the state |\u03c8 \u2212 i with both Alice\nand Charlie, while Alice and Charlie are not entangled. In order to swap his entanglement,\nBob then measures his two qubits in the Bell basis. Before the measurement, the state of\nthe global system is, up to local unitaries,\n1\n1\n1\n1 \u2212\n|\u03c8 iB |\u03c8 \u2212 iAC + |\u03c8 + iB |\u03c8 + iAC + |\u03c6\u2212 iB |\u03c6\u2212 iAC + |\u03c6+ iB |\u03c6+ iAC ,\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the first two qubits belong to Bob, the third to Alice and the last to Charlie. After\nBob's measurement, Alice and Charlie are therefore left in a Bell state. The fact that the\nentanglement between Alice and Charlie comes from particles that never interacted means\nthat they do not share LHVs (but note that any experimental setup that uses this hypothesis\nwould have to be extremely well orchestrated in order to ensure that Alice and Charlie were\nnever in a situation where they could communicate). The argument presented in [14, 15]\nthen goes on to analyse the correlations of a Bell state as to whether they can be simulated\nby an LHV model where Alice's and Charlie's particles do not share any variables. The\nassumption made here is that whatever happens in Bob's lab is of no consequence. The\nreason given is that the LHVs of the particles belonging to Alice and Charlie cannot depend\non each other and cannot depend on what happened in Bob's lab. In the given interpretation\nof the experimental scheme, Bob's lab can be thrown into a black hole for all it matters.\nIs this argument valid? The answer is no. If Bob's knowledge of the outcome of the Bell\nmeasurement is lost, Alice and Charlie are left with a mixture of all the Bell states, each with\nequal probability. Obviously, this state is the totally mixed state and it is not entangled.\nTherefore, Alice's and Charlie's answers will not be correlated in any fashion. A simple\n3\n\n\fLHV model can then simulate measurements on Alice's and Charlie's particle: output at\nrandom! (while taking into account that for a general POVM on a totally mixed state, not\nevery POVM element will be produced with equal probability, and adjusting the marginal\nprobabilities accordingly). Hence, without even considering the specific measurements that\nare performed in the experiment, we conclude that any scheme with two participants that\nis based on entanglement swapping admits an LHV model.\nWhat if, instead of sending Bob into a black hole, we take into consideration his outcome?\nIf we know Bob's measurement outcome, then we know the actual Bell state that is shared\nbetween Alice and Charlie. We will now rewrite the experiment of [14] in the language of\nquantum information, and consider the case where Bob's measurement results are taken into\nconsideration. We show that this experiment also admits an LHV model that simulates the\ncorrelations, and that this is due to the fact that Bob shares LHVs with Alice and with\nCharlie.\nHere is the scheme that we consider: Bob does a Bell state measurement on the state\ndescribed in Equation (5). His outcome, say b, is therefore one of the four Bell states. Alice\nand Charlie are now left in a Bell state that depends on Bob's measurement outcome. They\nare then both asked to perform the same measurement: either in the standard basis (standard\n\u221a\nvon Neumann measurement,\nor \u03c3z ) or in the Hadamard basis (sending |0i \u2192 (|0i + |1i)/ 2\n\u221a\nand |1i \u2192 (|0i \u2212 |1i)/ 2, followed by a von Neumann measurement, or \u03c3x ). Let a \u2208 {\u22121, 1}\nbe Alice's outcome and c \u2208 {\u22121, 1} be Charlie's outcome. Alice and Charlie each output\na single bit (\u22121 or 1), but to ease the notation we will denote the outcomes a+ and c+ if\nthe measurements were performed in the standard basis and a\u00d7 and c\u00d7 if the measurements\nwere performed in the Hadamard basis. Depending on the state that they share after Bob's\nmeasurement, their results will either be correlated (a * c = 1) or anti-correlated (a * c = \u22121).\nTable 1 gives the measurements outcomes that are predicted by quantum mechanics. Note\nalso, that according to these predictions, the local outcomes of Alice, Bob, and Charlie are\nuniformly distributed. Recall that we are in a scenario where Alice and Charlie do not share\nb\na+ * c+\n|\u03c6+ i\n1\n\u2212\n|\u03c6 i\n1\n+\n|\u03c8 i\n\u22121\n|\u03c8 \u2212 i\n\u22121\n\na\u00d7 * c\u00d7\n1\n\u22121\n1\n\u22121\n\nTable 1: Measurement outcomes\nhidden variables. At first sight it seems reasonable to think that the correlations of Table 1\ncannot be fulfilled. However, Alice and Charlie are allowed to share variables with Bob. We\nwill now show how they can exploit this to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics\nusing only LHVs.\n4\n\n\fAlice, Bob and Charlie share four LHVs that each take the value \u22121 or 1 independently\nand with equal probability. We denote these values by \u03bba+ , \u03bba\u00d7 , \u03bbc+ and \u03bbc\u00d7 . When challenged to output the result of a measurement, Alice answers \u03bba+ if the measurement is in the\nstandard basis and \u03bba\u00d7 otherwise. Charlie does the same, answering \u03bbc+ and \u03bbc\u00d7 depending\non his measurement. In order to give an answer that is consistent with table 1, all that Bob\nneeds to do is compute the values \u03bba+ * \u03bbc+ and \u03bba\u00d7 * \u03bbc\u00d7 . He then outputs the Bell state that\nhe find in the corresponding row of Table 2. It is easy to see that this strategy that uses four\nbits of shared randomness satisfies all the conditions of Table 1 and that in addition, the\nlocal statistics correspond to those predicted by quantum mechanics. This technique works\nregardless of the order in which the participants are required to answer.\n\u03bba+ * \u03bbc+\n1\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\n\u03bba\u00d7 * \u03bbc\u00d7\n1\n\u22121\n1\n\u22121\n\nb\n|\u03c6+ i\n|\u03c6\u2212 i\n|\u03c8 + i\n|\u03c8 \u2212 i\n\nTable 2: LHV simulation\n\nThe technique that we have used is reminiscent to postselection: according to the answers\nthat Alice and Charlie are to give, Bob selects an appropriate measurement outcome. This\nis similar to [20], which, surprisingly, rules out the results presented many years later in [15].\nWe can formulate a similar argument against the Bell theorem presented by Ad\u00e1n Cabello\nin [21], as well as the one presented by Zeng-Bing Chen, Yu-Ao Chen and Jian-Wei Pan [19].\nIn all these cases, postselection is used in order to generate quantum correlations that cannot\nbe produced by any LHV model. These experiments omit to consider the possibility that,\nas we have shown above, an LHV model can use postselection to its advantage.\n\n3\n\nInside the light cone\n\nWhat if we consider particles that were created in space-like separated regions of spacetime that are later brought together? Could experiments performed on such particles and\nanalysed with the hypothesis that these particles cannot share any LHVs be convincing?\nIn [16, 17], it is argued that different physical quantities of a particle are elements of reality\nin the EPR sense. Then, the values of these observables are analysed as being independent\nsince they are elements of reality. One might be tempted to think that these assumptions\nare reasonable, however they are not. While creating the particles in space-like separated\nregions will ensure that they do not share any LHVs at that point, we cannot assume that\nthis property is conserved for the entire evolution of the system. In an LHV model, we do\n5\n\n\frequire that what happens to a particle outside the light cone of another cannot have any\ninfluence on the latter, but we can allow the particles to constantly broadcast information\nthat is secret to us (hidden travelling information) which travels at the speed of light in all\ndirections. Therefore, once we bring a particle in the forward light cone of the other, its LHVs\ncan be influenced by those of the other particle. This type of model is consistent with the\nlocal realistic viewpoint and invalidates the assumption that the LHVs will stay independent.\nThis argument applies mutatis mutandis to the assumption that different observables, which\nare elements of reality, do not share LHVs.\nWe now give a brief summary of the scheme proposed in [16], which uses the four-qubit\nstate:\n\u0001\n1\n|\u03c8i = |0i1 |0i2|0i3 |0i4 + |0i1|1i2 |0i3 |1i4 + |1i1 |0i2 |1i3|0i4 \u2212 |1i1|1i2 |1i3 |1i4 .\n(6)\n2\nQubits 1 and 2 belong to Alice and qubits 3 and 4 to Bob. Now consider the following three\nmeasurements Xj , Yj and Zj , performed individually on qubits j (j = 1 . . . 4):\nXj = |0ij h1| + |1ij h0|\nYj = i(|1ij h0| \u2212 |0ij h1|)\nZj = |0ij h0| \u2212 |1ij h1| .\n\n(7)\n\nEach of these measurements has two possible outcomes, +1 and \u22121. Let the outcome\nof measurement Xj be written xj \u2208 {+1, \u22121}, and similarly for Yj and Zj . Quantum\nmechanics tells us that when appropriate measurements are made on state |\u03c8i, the following\nfour equalities always hold:\nx1\ny1\nx1 x2\ny1 x2\n\n= x3 z4 ,\n= \u2212y3 z4 ,\n= y3 y4 ,\n= x3 y4\n\nand\n\nIn the scheme proposed in [16], Alice is asked one of two possible questions:\n1a. What are x1 and x2 ?\n2a. What are y1 and x2 ?\nBob is independently asked one of four possible questions:\n1b.\n2b.\n3b.\n4b.\n\nWhat\nWhat\nWhat\nWhat\n\nare\nare\nare\nare\n\nx3 and y4 ?\nx3 and z4 ?\ny3 and y4 ?\ny3 and z4 ?\n6\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n\n\fThe challenge that Alice and Bob face is to provide answers to these questions such that\nEquations (8)\u2013(11) are satisfied. Although it is shown in [16] that there is an element of\nreality corresponding to each measurement result, it is also possible that particles inside the\nsame light cone can exchange unlimited information. Therefore, measurements on separate\nparticles can be seen, for LHV model purposes, as one measurement on a global system.\nWe now give an explicit LHV model that perfectly mimics the predictions of quantum\nmechanics for the above scenario. Alice and Bob share two random variables, \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 .\nRegardless of the question she is asked, Alice always answers \"\u03bb1 \" and \"\u03bb2 \". Bob's strategy\nis to first flip a fair coin. The outcome (\u22121 or 1) of this coin flip is Bob's first answer, call it\nb1 . Bob then computes his second answer, b2 according to Table 3 by using the information\nthat he has: the question that he was asked, \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 and b1 . It is interesting to point out\nquestion\n1b\n2b\n3b\n4b\n\nb2\n\u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * b1\n\u03bb1 * b1\n\u03bb1 * \u03bb2 * b1\n\u2212\u03bb1 * b1\n\nTable 3: Bob's strategy in the LHV model for Cabello's game\nthat our LHV model not only satisfies the rules of Equations (8)\u2013(11), but also reproduces\nthe predictions of quantum mechanics perfectly: it is easy to see that in the LHV model,\nthe local outcomes of Alice and Bob are uniformly distributed, and that this corresponds\nexactly to the predictions of quantum mechanics!\nA similar argument can be used to show an LHV model to simulate the experiment\nin [17]. At this point, it is important to stress that this LHV model is not a contextual\nmodel in the usual sense of the term. Non-contextuality has to do with the choice of output\nin a given POVM [22], while here the \"context\" is which POVM is done on what particle.\nThis model is not contextual but uses hidden traveling information between the particles\nand is of course consistent with a local realistic viewpoint.\nThe argument presented by Cabello does rule out a certain class of LHV models, those\nthat do not use hidden traveling information, also called the EPRLER model by Cabello.\nHowever, it does not rule out every LHV model. There is of course a simple solution to\nmake the equations given in [16, 17] physically meaningful. We keep the elements of reality\nin space-like separated regions of space and give them to new players. We can thus convert\nthe game presented in [16, 17] into convincing experimental proposals [18].\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nDiscussion and conclusion\n\nSince Bell's 1964 discovery, new Bell experiments have continuously been proposed. The goal\nof such experiments is to demonstrate experimentally the nonlocality of the world in which\nwe live. In order to circumvent imperfections in the laboratory setting, new experiments\nare proposed to close experimental loopholes, one of the most notorious being the detection\nloophole [23]. But as we have demonstrated, not all Bell experiments are created equally,\nand a careful analysis is required in order to verify the validity of the proposed experiments.\nThe papers that we have analysed here have something in common: they start by arguing for\nthe existence of elements of reality and then base their analysis of the experiment on these\nelements of reality. However, the existence or independence of these elements of reality is not\ntested in the final experimental setup. We believe that this is what sets these experiments\napart from others and that allows an LHV model that explains the experiment.\nOne must also be careful using arguments that concern elements of reality. Einstein,\nPodolsky and Rosen gave a criterion to recognize elements of reality [3]:\nIf, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e.,\nwith probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists\nan element of physical reality corresponding to this physical quantity.\nIt cannot be stressed enough that this criterion is \"regarded not as a necessary, but merely\nas a sufficient, condition of reality\"[3]. Said differently, not every element of reality can necessarily be measured without disturbing the system. Otherwise, EPR would have claimed,\nafter showing that momentum and position can have simultaneous reality, that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation can be violated [24]!\nIn order to propose meaningful experiments, it is useful to use a higher level of abstraction\nto analyse the scenario: by placing the proposed experiments in the framework of pseudotelepathy, we have been able to show that an LHV model can explain the results of the\nexperiments. In fact, we believe that there is much to gain by studying nonlocality in an\nadversarial context: when analysing nonlocality proofs, one should be just as paranoid about\nNature cheating our senses as are cryptographers about the security of a protocol against\nattacks from a malicious adversary.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Ad\u00e1n Cabello, Hilary Carteret, Nicolas Gisin, Alain Tapp and\nJonathan Walgate for very stimulating discussions and S\u00e9bastien Gambs for helpful comments on the manuscript.
