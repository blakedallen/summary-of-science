As the gas in the interstellar medium, the gas in the intracluster medium (ICM) and\nfilaments is expected to be permeated with magnetic fields. Measuring Faraday rotation,\nthe rotation of the plane of linearly-polarized light due to the birefringence of magneto-ionic\nmedium, has been one of a few methods to explore the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF).\nObservational exploration of the IGMF using Faraday rotation measure (RM) was\nstarted with the investigation of the intracluster magnetic field (ICMF) (see Carilli & Taylor\n2002, for a review). An RM study of the Coma cluster, for instance, revealed the ICMF of\nthe strength of order \u223c \u03bcG for the coherent length of order \u223c 10 kpc (Kim et al. 1990).\nFor Abell clusters, the RM of typically \u223c 100 \u2212 200 rad m\u22122 was observed, indicating an\naverage strength of the ICMF to be \u223c 5\u201310 \u03bcG (Clarke et al. 2001; Clarke 2004). RM maps\nof clusters were analyzed to study the power spectrum of turbulent magnetic fields in the\nICM; for instance, a Kolmogorov-like spectrum with a bending at a few kpc scale was found\nin the cooled core region of the Hydra cluster (Vogt & Ensslin 2005), and spectra consistent\nwith the Kolmogorov spectrum were reported in the wider ICM for the Abell 2382 cluster\n(Guidetti et al. 2008) and for the Coma cluster (Bonafede et al. 2010).\nThe nature of the IGMF in filaments, on the contrary, remains largely unknown, because\nthe study of RM outside clusters is still scarce (e.g., Xu et al. 2006); detecting the RM due to\nthe IGMF in filaments is difficult with current facilities, and also removing the galactic foreground is not a trivial task. The next generation radio interferometers including the Square\nKilometer Array (SKA), and upcoming SKA pathfinders, the Australian SKA Pathfinder\n(ASKAP) and the South African Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT), as well the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), however, are expected to be used to study the RM. Particularly,\nthe SKA could measure RM for \u223c 108 polarized extragalactic sources across the sky with an\naverage spacing of \u223c 60 arcsec between lines of sight (LOS's) (see, e.g., Carilli & Rawlings\n2004; Krause et al. 2009, and references therein), enabling us to investigate the IGMF in the\nlarge-scale structure (LSS) of the universe.\nAttempts to theoretically predict the RM due to the IGMF have been made: for instance, Ryu et al. (1998) and Dolag et al. (2005) used hydrodynamic simulations for cosmological structure formation to study RM in the LSS, and more recently Dubios & Teyssier\n(2008) used MHD simulations to study RM for clusters. However, the properties of the\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIGMF, especially in filaments, such as the strength and coherence length as well as the spatial distribution, are largely unknown, hindering the theoretical study of RM in the LSS of\nthe universe.\nRecently, Ryu et al. (2008) proposed a physically motivated model for the IGMF, in\nwhich a part of the gravitational energy released during structure formation is transferred to\nthe magnetic field energy as a result of the turbulent dynamo amplification of weak seed fields\nin the LSS of the universe. In the model, the IGMF follows largely the matter distribution\nin the cosmic web and the strength is predicted to be hBi \u223c 10 nG in filaments. Cho & Ryu\n(2009) studied various characteristic length scales of magnetic fields in turbulence with very\nweak or zero mean magnetic field, and showed that the coherence length defined for RM is\n3/4 times the integral scale in the incompressible limit. They predicted that in filaments,\nthe coherence length for RM would be a few \u00d7 100 h\u22121 kpc with the IGMF of Ryu et al.\n(2008) and the RM due to the magnetic field would be of order \u223c 1 rad m\u22122 .\nIn this paper, we study RM in the LSS of the universe, focusing on RM through filaments, using simulations for cosmological structure formation along with the model IGMF\nof Ryu et al. (2008) and Cho & Ryu (2009). Specifically, we present the spatial distribution,\nprobability distribution function (PDF) and power spectrum of the RM, and discuss the\nprospect of possible observations of the RM. In sections 2 and 3, we describe our model and\nthe results. Discussion is in Section 4, and Summary and Conclusion follows in Section 4.\n\n2.\n\nModel\n\nTo investigate RM in the LSS of the universe, we used structure formation simulations\nfor a concordance \u039bCDM universe with the following values of cosmological parameters:\n\u03a9BM = 0.043, \u03a9DM = 0.227, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73, h \u2261 H0 /(100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) = 0.7, n = 1, and\n\u03c38 = 0.8 (same as in Ryu et al. 2008). They were performed using a particle-mesh/Eulerian,\ncosmological hydrodynamic code (Ryu et al. 1993). A cubic region of comoving volume\n(100 h\u22121 Mpc)3 was reproduced with 5123 uniform grid zones for gas and gravity and 2563\nparticles for dark matter, so the spatial resolution is 195 h\u22121 kpc. Sixteen simulations with\ndifferent realizations of initial condition were used to compensate cosmic variance.\nFor the IGMF, we employed the model of Ryu et al. (2008); it proposes that turbulentflow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated at cosmological shocks\nduring the formation of the LSS of the universe, and the IGMF is produced as a consequence\nof the amplification of weak seed fields of any origin by the turbulence. Then, the energy\ndensity (or the strength) of the IGMF can be estimated with the eddy turnover number and\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nthe turbulent energy density as follow:\n\u03b5B = \u03c6\n\n\u0012\n\nt\nteddy\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b5turb .\n\n(1)\n\nHere, the eddy turnover time is defined as the reciprocal of the vorticity at driving scales,\n~ \u00d7 ~v ), and \u03c6 is the conversion factor from turbulent to magnetic\nteddy \u2261 1/\u03c9driving (~\u03c9 \u2261 \u2207\nenergy that depends on the eddy turnover number t/teddy . The eddy turnover number was\nestimated as the age of universe times the magnitude of the local vorticity, that is, tage \u03c9. The\nlocal vorticity and turbulent energy density were calculated from simulations for cosmological\nstructure formation described above. A functional form for the conversion factor was derived\nfrom a separate, incompressible, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of turbulence\ndynamo. For the direction of the IGMF, we used that of the passive fields from simulations for\ncosmological structure formation, in which weak seed fields were evolved passively, ignoring\nthe back-reaction, along with flow motions (Kulsrud et al. 1997; Ryu et al. 1998).\nIn our model, as seed magnetic fields, we took the ones generated through the Biermann\nbattery mechanism (Biermann 1950) at cosmological shocks. There are, on the other hand,\na number of mechanisms that have been suggested to create seed fields in the early universe.\nBesides various inflationary and string theory mechanisms, the followings include a partial\nlist of astrophysical mechanisms. At cosmological shocks, in addition, Weibel instability can\noperate and produce magnetic fields (Medvedev et al. 2006; Schlickeiser & Shukla 2003),\nand streaming cosmic rays accelerated by the shocks can amplify weak upstream magnetic\nfields via non-resonant growing mode (Bell 2004). In addition, for instance, galactic outflows\nduring the starburst phase of galactic evolution (Donnert et al. 2009) and the return current\ninduced by cosmic-rays produced by Supernovae of first stars (Miniati & Bell 2010) were\nsuggested to deposit seed fields. We point, however, that in our model the IGMF resulting\nfrom turbulent amplification should be insensitive to the origin of seed fields.\nThe spatial distribution of the strength of the resulting IGMF is shown in Figure 4\nof Ryu et al. (2008) and Figure 1 of Ryu et al. (2010). It is very well correlated with the\ndistribution of matter. The average strength of our model IGMF for the WHIM with 105 <\nT < 107 K in filaments is hBi \u223c 10 nG, hB 2 i1/2 \u223c a few \u00d7 10 nG, h\u03c1Bi/h\u03c1i \u223c 0.1 \u03bcG, or\nh(\u03c1B)2 i1/2 /h\u03c12 i1/2 \u223c a few \u00d7 0.1 \u03bcG.\n3.\n\nResults\n\nWe calculated RM, defined as \u2206\u03c7/\u2206\u03bb2 (\u03c7 is the rotation angle of linearly-polarized\nlight at wavelength \u03bb), in the local universe with z = 0 along a path length of L = 100 h\u22121\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nMpc, which is the box size of structure formation simulations. Figure 1 shows the resulting\nRM map of (28 h\u22121 Mpc)2 area in logarithmic and linear scales. RM traces the large-scale\ndistribution of matter, and we see two clusters and a filamentary structure containing several\ngroups. Through the clusters, groups, and filament in the field, RM is roughly \u223c 100, \u223c 10,\nand \u223c 1, respectively, while RM through sheets and voids is much less. The bottom panel\nof Figure 1 shows the mixture of positive and negative RM, reflecting the randomness of\nmagnetic fields in the LSS.\nWith the coherence length of magnetic fields for RM (see Discussion) expected to be\nsmaller than the path length which should be a cosmological scale, the inducement of RM is\nexpected be a random walk process. Figure 2 shows the distributions of RM as well as other\nquantities along a few LOS's through filaments; it confirms that the inducement of RM is\nindeed a random walk process. However, we note that the resulting RM is dominated by the\ncontribution from the density peak along LOS's.\nTo quantify RM in the LSS of the universe, we calculated the probability distribution\nfunction (PDF) of |RM| for 5122 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 16 (projected grid zones \u00d7 directions \u00d7 runs) LOS's.\nFigure 3 shows the resulting PDF through the LOS's of different ranges of the mean temperature weighted with X-ray emissivity, TX . The figure also shows the fitting to the log-normal\ndistribution,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(log10 |RM| \u2212 \u03bc)2\n1\n,\n(2)\nexp \u2212\nPDF(log10 |RM|) = \u221a\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c0\u03c3 2\nfinding that the PDF closely follows the log-normal distribution. We also calculated the\nroot mean square (rms) of RM, hRMirms ; note that the mean of RM, hRMi, is zero for our\nIGMF. Through the WHIM, which mostly composes filaments, hRMirms = 1.41 rad m\u22122 .\nThis agrees well with the value predicted with the mean strength and coherence length of\nthe IGMF in filaments by Cho & Ryu (2009). However, this is an order of magnitude smaller\nthan the values of |RM| toward the Hercules and Perseus-Pisces superclusters reported in\nXu et al. (2006). The difference is mostly due to the mass-weighted path length; the value\nquoted by Xu et al. (2006) is about two orders of magnitude larger than ours. Through\nthe hot gas with 107 < T < 108 K, hRMirms = 108 rad m\u22122 , which is in good agreement\nwith RM observations of galaxy clusters (Clarke et al. 2001; Clarke 2004). Through the hot\ngas, however, we found RM of up to & 1000 rad m\u22122 . This should be an artifact of limited\nresolution (see Discussion). So the values for the hot gas in our work should not be taken\nseriously.\nFinally, we calculated the two-dimensional power spectrum of RM on 3\u00d716 (directions\u00d7\nruns) projected planes; PRM (k) \u223c |RM(~k)|2 k, where RM(~k) is the Fourier transform of\nRM(~x) on planes. Figure 4 shows the resulting power spectrum along with the power spectra\nof electron density, magnetic fields, and the curl component of flow motions, ~vcurl , which\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n~ \u00d7 ~vcurl \u2261 \u2207\n~ \u00d7 ~v. The power spectrum of RM peaks at k \u223c 100,\nsatisfies the relation \u2207\n\u22121\nwhich corresponds to \u223c 1 h Mpc. Cosmic variance is not significant around the peak,\nalthough it is larger at smaller k, as expected. The power spectrum of RM reflects the\nspatial distributions of electron density, ne , and LOS magnetic field, Bk . The power spectra of\nprojected ne and projected Bk , have peaks at \u223c 3 h\u22121 Mpc and \u223c 1.5 h\u22121 Mpc, respectively.\nThe shape of the power spectrum of RM follows that of projected Bk rather than that of\nprojected ne , implying that the statistics of RM would primarily carry the statistics of the\nIGMF.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOur results depend of RM on the strength and coherence length of the IGMF. We\nemployed a model where the strength of the local IGMF was estimated based on turbulence\ndynamo, while the direction was gripped from structure formation simulations with passive\nfields (see Section 2). In principle, if we had performed full MHD simulations, we could have\nfollowed the amplification of the IGMF through turbulence dynamo along with its direction.\nIn practice, however, the currently available computational resources do not allow a numerical\nresolution high enough to reproduce the full development of MHD turbulence. Since the\nnumerical resistivity is larger than the physical resistivity by many orders of magnitude, the\ngrowth of magnetic fields is expected to be saturated before dynamo action becomes fully\noperative (see, e.g., Kulsrud et al. 1997). In such situation, the state of magnetic fields in\nfull MHD, including, for instance, the power spectrum, is expected to mimic that of passive\nfields. This is the reason why we adopted the model of Ryu et al. (2008) to estimate the\nstrength of the IGMF, but we still used passive fields from structure formation simulations\nto model the field direction.\nThe validity of our model IGMF was checked as follows:\n1) In MHD turbulence, the distribution of magnetic fields, including the direction, is expected to correlate with that of vorticity, since magnetic fields and vorticity are described by\nsimilar equations except the baroclinity term in the equation for vorticity (if dissipative processes are ignored) (see, e.g., Kulsrud et al. 1997). Such a correlation can be clearly seen in\nFigure 5, in which we depicts the distributions of our IGMF and vorticity in two-dimensional\nslices.\n2) Full MHD turbulence simulations suggest that the peak of magnetic field spectrum occurs\n\u223c 1/2 of the energy injection scale, or the peak scale of velocity power spectrum, at saturation; in the linear growth stage, the peak scale of magnetic field spectrum grows as \u223c t1.5\nor so (Cho & Ryu 2009). With our model IGMF, the peak scale of magnetic field spectrum\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nis \u223c 1 h\u22121 Mpc (the third panel of Figure 4); on the other hand, the curl component of\nflow motions has the peak of power spectrum at \u223c 4 h\u22121 Mpc (the bottom panel of Figure\n4). That is, the peak scale of magnetic field spectrum is \u223c 1/4 of the energy injection scale\nin our model IGMF. By considering the turbulence in the LSS of the universe has not yet\nreached the fully saturated stage (see, e.g., Ryu et al. 2008), the ratio of the two scales seems\nto be feasible.\nThese suggest that our model IGMF would produce reasonable results, although eventually it needs to be replaced with that from full MHD simulations for cosmological structure\nformation when computational resources allow such simulations in future.\nApart from our model for the IGMF, the finite numerical resolution of simulations\ncould affect our results. The average strength of our model IGMF is hBi \u223c a few \u03bcG in\nclusters/groups, \u223c 0.1\u03bcG around clusters/groups, and \u223c 10 nG in filaments. Ryu et al.\n(2008) tested the numerical convergence of the estimation. With simulations of different\nnumerical resolutions for cosmological structure formation, it was shown that hBi of our\nmodel IGMF for the WHIM with 105 < T < 107 K would approach the convergence value\nwithin a factor \u223c 2 \u2212 3 at the resolution of 5123 grids (see Figure S5 of SOM of Ryu et al.\n(2008)).\nIt is, on the other hand, rather tricky to assess the effect of finite resolution on the\ncoherence length of our model IGMF, because the definition of coherence length for RM is\nnot completely clear and the estimation of coherence length, for instance, for the filament\nIGMF alone is not trivial. We tried to quantify coherence length in the following three ways:\n1) We directly calculated the coherence length of Bk , that is, the length with the same sign\nof Bk , along LOS's. Figure 6 shows the PDF of the resulting coherence length through the\nWHIM, which composes mostly filaments. It peaks at the length of 3 zones corresponding\nto 586 h\u22121 kpc. 2) We calculated 3/4 times the integral scale,\nR 3D\nP (k)/k dk\n3\n\u00d7 2\u03c0 R B 3D\n,\n(3)\n4\nPB (k) dk\n\nwhich is the coherence length defined for RM in the incompressible limit (see Introduction),\nfor the IGMF inside the whole computational box of (100 h\u22121 Mpc)3 volume. Here, PB3D (k)\nis the three-dimensional power spectrum of magnetic fields (the third panel of Figure 4).\nWe found the value to be \u223c 800 h\u22121 kpc for our model IGMF. 3) We also calculated the\nlargest energy containing scale in the whole computational box, which is the peak scale of\nkPB3D (k) (not shown). It is \u223c 900 h\u22121 kpc for our model IGMF. Note that the latter two\nvalues include contributions from the IGMF in filaments as well as in clusters, sheets, and\nvoids. All the three scales are comparable. These length scales are \u223c 3 to 5 times larger\nthan the grid resolution of our simulations, 195 h\u22121 kpc.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nCho & Ryu (2009) studied characteristic lengths in incompressible simulations of MHD\nturbulence (see Introduction); based on it, they predicted that the coherence length for RM\nwould be a few \u00d7 100 h\u22121 kpc in filaments, while a few \u00d7 10 h\u22121 kpc in clusters. With our\ngrid resolution of 195 h\u22121 kpc, the coherence length of the IGMF in clusters should not be\nresolved and so our estimation of RM for clusters should be resolution-affected, as pointed\nin Section 3. On the other hand, while the predicted coherence length for the IGMF in\nfilaments is still larger than the grid resolution, the estimated coherence length of Bk for the\nWHIM is a couple of times larger than the prediction for filaments. It could be partly due to\nthe limited resolution in our simulations. However, as noted in Section 3, RM is dominantly\ncontributed by the density peak along LOS's (Figure 2).\nThe above statements indicate that our estimate of the RM through filaments is expected\nto have uncertainties, especially due to limited resolution of our simulations; the error in our\nestimation could be up to a factor of several.\n\n5.\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nWe studied RM in the LSS of the universe, focusing on RM through filaments; simulations for cosmological structure formation were used and the model IGMF of Ryu et al.\n(2008) and Cho & Ryu (2009) based on turbulence dynamo was employed. Our findings are\nsummarized as follows. 1) With our model IGMF, the rms of RM through filaments at the\npresent universe is \u223c 1 rad m\u22122 . 2) The PDF of |RM| through filaments follows the lognormal distribution. 3) The power spectrum of RM due to the IGMF in the local universe\npeaks at a scale of \u223c 1 h\u22121 Mpc. 4) Within the frame of our mode IGMF, we expect that\nthe uncertainty in our estimation for the rms of RM through filaments, due to the finite\nnumerical resolution of simulations, would be a factor of a few.\nWe note that our model does not include other possible contributions to the IGMF, for\ninstance, that from galactic black holes (AGN feedbacks) (see, e.g., Kronberg et al. 2001).\nSo our model may be regarded as a minimal model, providing a baseline for the IGMF.\nWith such contributions, the real IGMF might be somewhat stronger, resulting in somewhat\nlarger RM.\nIt has been suggested that future radio observatories such as LOFAR, ASKAP, MeerKAT\nand SKA could detect the extragalactic RM of \u223c 1 rad m\u22122 we predict (see, e.g., Beck\n2009). However, it is known that the typical galactic foreground of RM is a few tens\nand of order ten rad m\u22122 in the low and high galactic latitudes, respectively (see, e.g.,\nSimard-Normandin & Kronberg 1980). So the detection of the extragalactic RM of \u223c\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n1 rad m\u22122 or so could be possible only after the galactic foreground is removed. We note,\nhowever, that with filaments at cosmological distance, the peak of the power spectrum of\nthe RM due to the IGMF in filaments would occur at small angular scales; for instance, for\na filament at a distance of 100 h\u22121 Mpc, the peak would occur at \u223c 0.5 degree or so. This is\nmuch smaller than the expected angular scale of the peak of the galactic foreground, which\nwould be around tens degree (see, e.g., Frick et al. 2001). Then, it would be plausible to\nextract the signature of the RM of \u223c 1 rad m\u22122 due to the IGMF in filaments. We leave\nthis issue and connecting our theoretical prediction of RM in the LSS of the universe to\nobservation for future studies.\nTA was supported in part by National Research Foundation of Korea (R01-2007-00020196-0).
