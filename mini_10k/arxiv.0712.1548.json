They are an important probe to\nbetter understanding dark matter. Weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) are\nthe most favorite candidates for dark matter and their nature can be explored\nstudying gamma rays coming from WIMP pair annihilations.\nThis approach is complementary to the information that will come from the\nmeasurement of the antiproton and positron spectrum by the next generation cosmicray experiments. Mapping gamma rays coming from the interaction of primary p and\nHe can also give a deep insight on cosmic-ray production and propagation\nmechanisms.\nFinally many theories of physics beyond the standard model predict the\nexistence of large extra space-time dimensions at an energy scale as low as 1 TeV\nand a possible high energy break-down of the Lorentz invariance.\nThe existence of extra dimensions can imply an enhancement of the expected\ngamma ray flux while a test of the Lorentz invariance can be done through\ncorrelated measurements of the difference in the arrival time of gamma-ray photons\nand neutrinos emitted from active galactic nuclei or gamma-ray bursts. In this\nWorkshop all these topics had been covered both from the theoretical and\nexperimental point of view.\nAn update on the current and planned research for space-borne and groundbased experiments dedicated to the observation of the gamma-ray sky was given\nwith particular enphasis on the succesfull launch of AGILE.\nWe warmly thank the session chairpersons and all the speakers for their\ncontribution to the scientific success of the Conference.\nThe Conference was sponsored and supported by the Department of Physics\nof the University of Roma \"Tor Vergata, the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Fisica\n\n\fNucleare (INFN) Section of Roma Tor Vergata and the National Laboratory of\nFrascati.\nWe wish to thank the Organising Committee and International Scientific\nAdvisory Commitee members for their valuable scientific advice and support all\nalong the course of the conference organization.\nSpecial thanks go to all the people involved in the Conference organization:\nWe are particularly grateful to Li\u00f9 Catena and all the Villa Mondragone Staff, Marta\nSolinas and Gabriella Ardizzoia for their valuable help in preparing and dealing with\nall the logistics and for the day-by-day assistance at Villa Mondragone and to\nVincenzo Buttaro for the creation and updating of the web page.\nFinally, our special thank goes to Luigina Invidia, of the Ufficio\nPubblicazioni of the Frascati Laboratories, for the technical editing of these\nProceedings.\nAndrea Lionetto, Aldo Morselli, Piergiorgio Picozza\nOctober 2007\n\nThe book is available in electronic format at\nhttp://www.roma2.infn.it/SciNeGHE07/\n\n\f\fPhoto by: Pietro Oliva\n\n\fTABLE OF CONTENTS\nPreface .........................................................................................................................

An optimal angular\nresolution and very large fields of view are obtained by the use of stateof-the-art Silicon detectors integrated in a very compact instrument.\nAGILE was successfully launched on April 23, 2007 from the Indian base\nof Sriharikota and was inserted in a low-particle background equatorial\norbit. AGILE will provide crucial data for the study of Active Galactic\nNuclei, Gamma-Ray Bursts, unidentified gamma-ray sources, Galactic\ncompact objects, supernova remnants, TeV sources, and fundamental\nphysics by microsecond timing.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe space program AGILE (Astro-rivelatore Gamma a Immagini LEggero) is a\nhigh-energy astrophysics Mission supported by the Italian Space Agency (ASI)\nwith scientific and programmatic participation by INAF, INFN and several\nItalian universities [25]. The industrial team includes Carlo Gavazzi Space,\nThales-Alenia-Space-Laben, Oerlikon-Contraves, and Telespazio.\nThe main scientific goal of the AGILE program is to provide a powerful and\ncost-effective mission with excellent imaging capability simultaneously in the\n30 MeV-50 GeV and 18-60 keV energy ranges with a very large field of view\n[26, 7, 27].\nAGILE was successfully launched by the Indian PSLV-C8 rocket from the\nSriharikota base on April 23, 2007 (Fig. 1). The launch and orbital insertion were nominal, and a quasi-equatorial orbit was achieved with the smallest\ninclination (2.5 degrees) ever achieved by a high-energy space mission.\nThe AGILE instrument design is innovative and based on the state-of-theart technology of solid state Silicon detectors and associated electronics developed in Italian laboratories [3, 4, 5, 6, 16]. The instrument is very compact\n(see Fig. 2) and light (\u223c 120 kg) and is aimed at detecting new transients and\nmonitoring gamma-ray sources within a very large field of view (FOV \u223c 1/5 of\nthe whole sky). The total satellite mass is equal to 350 kg (see Fig. 3).\nAGILE is expected to substantially advance our knowledge in several research areas including the study of Active Galactic Nuclei and massive black\nholes, Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), the unidentified gamma-ray sources, Galactic transient and steady compact objects, isolated and binary pulsars, pulsar\nwind nebulae (PWNae), supernova remnants, TeV sources, and the Galactic\nCenter. Furthermore, the fast AGILE electronic readout and data processing\n\n\fM.

The Anticoincidence system is partially\ndisplayed, and no lateral electronic boards and harness are shown for simplicity.\nThe AGILE instrument \"core\" is approximately a cube of about 60 cm size and\nof weight equal to 100 kg.\n\nthat are of interest for both Galactic objects (searching outburst durations\ncomparable with the dynamical timescale of \u223c 1 M\u2299 compact objects) and\nquantum gravity studies [30] .\nThe AGILE Science Program will be focused on a prompt response to\ngamma-ray transients and alert for follow-up multiwavelength observations.\nAGILE will provide crucial information complementary to several space missions (Chandra, INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton, SWIFT, Suzaku) and it will support ground-based investigations in the radio, optical, and TeV bands. Part of\nthe AGILE Science Program will be open for Guest Investigations on a competitive basis. Quicklook data analysis and fast communication of new transients\nwill be implemented as an essential part of the AGILE Science Program.\n\n\fM. Tavani et al.,\n\nAGILE in orbit\n\n5\n\nFigure 3: The integrated AGILE satellite in its final configuration before being\ncovered by the thermal blanket. The total satellite mass is equal to 350 kg.\n\n2\n\nThe Scientific Instrument\n\nThe AGILE scientific payload is made of three detectors combined into one\nintegrated instrument with broad-band detection and imaging capabilities. The\nAnticoincidence and Data Handling systems complete the instrument. Table 1\n\n\f6\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nsummarizes the instrument scientific performance.\nThe Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector (GRID) is sensitive in the energy range \u223c 30 MeV\u201350 GeV, and consists of a Silicon-Tungsten Tracker, a\nCesium Iodide Calorimeter, and the Anticoincidence system1 . It is characterized by a very fine spatial resolution (obtained by a special arrangement\nof Silicon microstrip detectors and analog signal storage and processing) and\n<\nby the smallest ever obtained deadtime for gamma-ray detection (\u223c200 \u03bcs).\nThe GRID is designed to achieve an optimal angular resolution (source location accuracy \u223c 15\u2032 for intense sources), an unprecedentedly large field-of-view\n(\u223c 2.5 sr), and a sensitivity comparable to that of EGRET for sources within\n10-20 degree off-axis (and substantially better for larger off-axis angles).\nThe hard X-ray imager (Super-AGILE) is a unique feature of the\nAGILE instrument. This imager is placed on top of the gamma-ray detector\nand is sensitive in the 18-60 keV band. It has an optimal angular resolution (6\narcmin) and a good sensitivity over a \u223c 1 sr field of view (\u223c10-15 mCrab onaxis for a 1-day integration). The main characteristic of AGILE will be then the\npossibility of simultaneous gamma-ray and hard X-ray source detection with\narcminute positioning and on-board GRB/transient source alert capability.\nA Mini-Calorimeter operating in the \"burst mode\" is the third\nAGILE detector. It is part of the GRID, but also is capable of independently\ndetecting GRBs and other transients in the 350 keV - 100 MeV energy range\nwith optimal timing capabilities.\nFig. 3 shows the integrated AGILE satellite and Fig. 2 a schematic representation of the instrument. We briefly describe here the main detecting units of\nthe AGILE instrument; more detailed information will be presented elsewhere\n[28].\n\u2022 The Silicon-Tracker (ST) providing the gamma-ray imager is based on\nphoton conversion into electron-positron pairs. It consists of a total of\n12 trays with a repetition pattern of 1.9 cm (Fig. 4). The first 10 trays\nare capable of converting gamma-rays by a Tungsten layer. Tracking of\ncharged particles is ensured by high-resolution Silicon microstrip detectors that are configured to provide the two orthogonal coordinates for\neach element (point) along the track. The fundamental Silicon detector\nunit is a tile of area 9.5 \u00d7 9.5 cm2 , microstrip pitch equal to 121 \u03bcm,\nand thickness 410 \u03bcm. The AGILE ST readout system is capable of detecting and storing the energy deposited by the penetrating particles for\nhalf of the Silicon microstrips. This implies an alternating readout system characterized by \"readout\" and \"floating\" strips. The analog signal\n\n1 In contrast with previous generation instruments (COS-B, EGRET), AGILE does not\nrequire gas operations and/or refilling, and does not require high-voltages.\n\n\fM. Tavani et al.,\n\nAGILE in orbit\n\n7\n\nproduced in the readout strips is read and stored for further processing.\nThe fundamental element is a Silicon tile with a total of 384 readout\nchannels (readout pitch equal to 242 \u03bcm) and 3 TAA1 chips required to\nprocess independently the analog signal from the readout strips. Each SiTracker layer is made of 4\u00d74 Si-tiles, for a total geometric area of 38 \u00d7 38\ncm2 . The first 10 trays are equipped with a Tungsten layer of 245 \u03bcm\n(0.07 X0 ) positioned in the lower part of the tray. The Silicon detectors\nproviding the two orthogonal coordinates are positioned at the very top\nand bottom of these trays. For each tray there are 2 \u00d7 1, 536 readout\nmicrostrips. Since the ST trigger requires at least three planes to be activated, two more trays are inserted at the bottom of the Tracker without\nthe Tungsten layers. The total readout channel number for the GRID\nTracker is then 36, 864. Both digital and analog information (charge deposition in Si-microstrip) is read by TAA1 chips. The distance between\nmid-planes equals 1.9 cm (optimized by Montecarlo simulations). The\nST has an on-axis total radiation length near 0.8 X0 . Special trigger\nlogic algorithms implemented on-board (Level-1 and Level-2) lead to a\nsubstantial particle/albedo-photon background subtraction and a preliminary on-board reconstruction of the photon incidence angle. Both digital\nand analog information are crucial for this task. Fig. 5 shows a typical\ngamma-ray event detected by the GRID during the pre-launch satellite\ntests. Fig. 6 shows the first gamma-ray event detected by the GRID in\norbit. The positional resolution obtained by the ST is excellent, being\nbelow 40 \u03bcm for a large range of particle incidence angles [8].\n\u2022 Super-AGILE (SA), the ultra-compact and light hard-X-ray imager of\nAGILE [14] is a coded-mask system made of a Silicon detector plane and\na thin Tungsten mask positioned 14 cm above it (Fig. 7). The detector\nplane is organized in four independent square Silicon detectors (19 \u00d7\n19 cm2 each) plus dedicated front-end electronics based on the XAA1.2\nchips (suitable in the SA energy range). The total number of SA readout\nchannels is 6,144. The detection cabability of SA includes: (1) photonby-photon transmission and imaging of sources in the energy range 1860 keV, with a large field-of-view (FOV \u223c 1 sr); (2) a good angular\nresolution (6 arcmin); (3) a good sensitivity (\u223c 10 mCrab between 18-60\n<\nkeV for 50 ksec integration, and \u223c 1 Crab for a few seconds integration).\nThe hard-X-ray imager is aimed at the simultaneous X-ray and gammaray detection of high-energy sources with excellent timing capabilities (a\nfew microsecond deadtime for individual detectors). The AGILE satellite\nis equipped with an ORBCOMM transponder capable of trasmitting GRB\ncoordinates to the ground within 1-2 min.\n\u2022 The Mini-Calorimeter (MCAL) is made of 30 Thallium activated Ce-\n\n\f8\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 4: The assembled AGILE Silicon Tracker developed by the INFN laboratories of Trieste before being integrated with the rest of the instrument (June\n2005).\nsium Iodide (CsI(Tl)) bars arranged in two planes, for a total (on-axis)\nradiation length of 1.5 X0 [20] . The signal from each CsI bar is collected\nby two photodiodes placed at both ends. The MCAL aims are: (i) obtaining additional information on the energy deposited in the CsI bars\nby particles produced in the Silicon Tracker (and therefore contributing\nto the determination of the total photon energy); (ii) detecting GRBs\nand other impulsive events with spectral and intensity information in the\nenergy band \u223c 0.35 \u2212 100 MeV. An independent burst search algorithm\nis implemented on board with a wide dynamic range for the MCAL independent GRB detection.\n\u2022 The Anticoincidence (AC) System is aimed at both charged particle background rejection and preliminary direction reconstruction for\ntriggered photon events. The AC system completely surrounds all AGILE detectors (Super-AGILE, Si-Tracker and MCAL). Each lateral face\nis segmented in three plastic scintillator layers (0.6 cm thick) connected\nwith photomultipliers placed at the bottom. A single plastic scintillator\nlayer (0.5 cm thick) constitutes the top-AC whose signal is read by four\nlight photomultipliers placed externally to the AC system and supported\nby the four corners of the structure frame. The segmentation of the AC\n\n\fM. Tavani et al.,\n\nAGILE in orbit\n\n9\n\nFigure 5: A typical gamma-ray event produced by cosmic-rays and detected by\nthe AGILE Tracker with its characteristic pattern of released energy in clusters\nof hit readout Silicon microstrips.\nSystem and the ST trigger logic contribute to produce the very large field\nof view of the AGILE-GRID.\nThe Data Handling (DH) and power supply systems complete the instrument. The DH is optimized for fast on-board processing of the GRID, MiniCalorimeter and Super-AGILE data. Given the relatively large number of readable channels in the ST and Super-AGILE (\u223c40,000), the instrument requires a\nvery efficient on-board data processing system. The GRID trigger logic for the\nacquisition of gamma-ray photon data and background rejection is structured\nin two main levels: Level-1 and Level-2 trigger stages. The Level-1 trigger is\n<\nfast (\u223c 5\u03bcs) and requires a signal in at least three out of four contiguous tracker\nplanes, and a proper combination of fired TAA1 chip number signals and AC\nsignals. An intermediate Level-1.5 stage is also envisioned (lasting \u223c 20 \u03bcs),\n\n\f10\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 6: The first gamma-ray event detected by AGILE in space (May 10,\n2007).\n\nwith the acquisition of the event topology based on the identification of fired\nTAA1 chips. Both Level-1 and Level-1.5 have a hardware-oriented veto logic\nproviding a first cut of background events. Level-2 data processing includes a\nGRID readout and pre-processing, \"cluster data acquisition\" (analog and digital information). The Level-2 processing is asynchronous (estimated duration\n\u223c a few ms) with the actual GRID event processing. The GRID deadtime\n<\nturns out to be \u223c 200 \u03bcs and is dominated by the Tracker readout.\nThe charged particle and albedo-photon background passing the Level<\n1+1.5 trigger level of processing is simulated to be \u223c 100 events/sec for the\nnominal equatorial orbit of AGILE. The on-board Level-2 processing has the\ntask of reducing this background by a factor between 3 and 5. Off-line processing of the GRID data with both digital and analog information is being\ndeveloped with the goal to reduce the particle and albedo-photon background\nrate above 100 MeV to \u223c0.01 events/sec.\nIn order to maximize the GRID FOV and detection efficiency for large-angle\n\n\fM.

For events depositing more than 200 MeV\nin the MCAL, the AC veto may be disabled to allow the acquisition of gammaray photon events with energies larger than 1 GeV.\nA special set of memory buffers and burst search algorithms are implemented to maximize data acquisition for transient gamma-ray events (e.g.,\nGRBs) in the ST, Super-AGILE and Mini-Calorimeter, respectively. The\nSuper-AGILE event acquisition envisions a first \"filtering\" based on AC-veto\nsignals, and pulse-height discrimination in the dedicated front end electronics\n(based on XA1 chips). The events are then buffered and transmitted to the\nCPU for burst searching and final data formatting. The four Si-detectors of\nSuper-AGILE are organized in sixteen independent readout units, resulting in\na \u223c 5 \u03bcs global deadtime[23].\nIn order to maximize the detecting area and minimize the instrument weight,\n\n\f12\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nthe GRID and Super-AGILE front-end-electronics is partly accommodated in\nspecial boards placed externally on the Tracker lateral faces. Electronic boxes,\nP/L memory (and buffer) units are positioned at the bottom of the instrument\nwithin the spacecraft body.\nTable 1: AGILE Scientific Performance\nGamma-ray Imaging Detector (GRID)\nEnergy range\nField of view\nFlux sensitivity (E > 100 MeV, 5\u03c3 in 106 s)\nAngular resolution at 400 MeV (68% cont. radius)\nSource location accuracy (high Gal. lat., 90% C.L.))\nEnergy resolution (at 400 MeV)\nAbsolute time resolution\nDeadtime\nHard X\u2013ray Imaging Detector (Super-AGILE)\nEnergy range\nSingle (1-dim.) detector FOV (FW at zero sens.)\nCombined (2-dim.) detector FOV (FW at zero sens.)\nSensitivity (at 18-60 keV, 5\u03c3 in 1 day)\nAngular resolution (pixel size)\nSource location accuracy (S/N\u223c10)\nEnergy resolution (FWHM)\nAbsolute time accuracy\nMini-Calorimeter\nEnergy range\nEnergy resolution ( at 1.3 MeV )\nAbsolute time resolution\nDeadtime (for each of the 30 CsI bars)\n\n3\n\n30 MeV \u2013 50 GeV\n\u223c 2.5 sr\n3\u00d710\u22127 (ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 )\n1.2 degrees\n\u223c15 arcmin\n\u2206E/E\u223c1\n\u223c 2 \u03bcs\n100 \u2212 200 \u03bcs\n18 \u2013 60 keV\n107\u25e6 \u00d768\u25e6\n68\u25e6 \u00d768\u25e6\n\u223c 10 mCrab\n\u223c 6 arcmin\n\u223c2-3 arcmin\n\u2206E< 8 keV\n\u223c 4 \u03bcs\n0.35 \u2013 100 MeV\n13% FWHM\n\u223c 3 \u03bcs\n\u223c 20 \u03bcs\n\nScience with AGILE\n\nThis section summarizes the main features of the AGILE scientific capability.\nThe AGILE instrument has been designed and developed to obtain:\n\u2022 excellent imaging capability in the energy range 100 MeV-50 GeV,\nimproving the EGRET angular resolution by a factor of 2, see Fig. 9;\n\u2022 a very large field-of-view for both the gamma-ray imager (2.5 sr) and\nthe hard X-ray imager (1 sr), (FOV larger by a factor of \u223c6 than that of\nEGRET);\n\n\fM.

Super-AGILE operating in the 15-45 keV\nband has a spatial resolution of 6 arcminute (pixel size). This translates into a\npositional accuracy of 1-3 arcmins for relatively strong transients at the Crab\nflux level.\n3.2 Large FOV monitoring of gamma-ray sources\nA crucial feature of AGILE is its large field of view for both the gamma-ray\nand hard X-ray detectors. Fig. 10 shows typical gamma-ray FOVs obtained for\na sequence of AGILE pointings. Relatively bright AGNs and Galactic sources\nflaring in the gamma-ray energy range above a flux of 10\u22126 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 can be\ndetected within a few days by the AGILE Quicklook Analysis. We conservatively estimate that for a 2-year mission AGILE is potentially able to detect\nhundreds of gamma-ray flaring AGNs and other transients. The very large\nFOV will also favor the detection of GRBs above 30 MeV. Taking into account\nthe high-energy distribution of GRB emission above 30 MeV, we conservatively\nestimate that \u223c1 GRB/month can be detected and imaged in the gamma-ray\nrange by the GRID. Super-AGILE may be able to detect about 30% of the\nsources detected by INTEGRAL [10]; about 10 hard X-ray sources per day are\nexpected to be detected by SA for typical pointings of the Galactic plane.\n3.3 Fast reaction to strong high-energy transients\nThe existence of a large number of variable gamma-ray sources (extragalactic and near the Galactic plane, e.g., [24]) makes necessary a reliable program for quick response to transient gamma-ray emission. Quicklook Analysis\nof gamma-ray data is a crucial task to be carried out by the AGILE Team.\nPrompt communication of gamma-ray transients (requiring typically 1-3 days\nto be detected with high confidence for sources above 10\u22126 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) will\nbe ensured. Detection of short timescale (seconds/minutes/hours) transients\n(GRBs, SGRs, and other bursting events) is possible in the gamma-ray range.\nA primary responsibility of the AGILE Team will be to provide positioning of\nshort-timescale transient as accurate as possible, and to alert the community\nthough dedicated channels.\n\n\f16\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n3.4 Accumulating exposure on Galactic and extragalactic sky areas\nThe AGILE average exposure per source will be larger by a factor of \u223c 4 for\na 1-year sky-survey program compared to the typical exposure obtainable by\nEGRET for the same time period. Deep exposures for selected regions of the\nsky can be obtained by a proper program with repeated overlapping pointings.\nThis can be particularly useful to study selected Galactic and extragalactic\nsources.\n3.5 High-Precision Timing\nAGILE detectors have optimal timing capabilities. The on-board GPS system\nallows to reach an absolute time tagging precision for individual photons better\nthan 2 \u03bcs. Depending on the event characteristics, absolute time tagging can\nachieve values near 1 \u2212 2 \u03bcs for the Silicon-Tracker, and 3 \u2212 4 \u03bcs for the MiniCalorimeter and Super-AGILE.\nInstrumental deadtimes will be unprecedentedly small for gamma-ray detection. The GRID deadtime will be lower than 200 \u03bcs (improving by almost three\norders of magnitude the performance of previous spark-chamber detectors such\nas EGRET). Taking into account the segmentation of the electronic readout of\nMCAL and Super-AGILE detectors (30 MCAL elements and 16 Super-AGILE\nelements) the MCAL and SA effective deadtimes will be less than those for\nindividual units. We obtain \u223c 2 \u03bcs for MCAL, and 5 \u03bcs for SA. Furthermore,\na special memory will ensure that MCAL events detected during the Si-Tracker\nreadout deadtime will be automatically stored in the GRID event. For these\nevents, precise timing and detection in the \u223c 1\u2013200 MeV range can be achieved\nwith temporal resolution well below 100 \u03bcs. This may be crucial for AGILE\nhigh-precision timing investigations.\n3.6 AGILE and GLAST\nAGILE and GLAST [15] are complementary missions in many respects: we\nbriefly outline here some important points, postponing a more general discussion [29]. The GLAST gamma-ray instrument covers a broad spectrum and is\nespecially optimized in the high energy range above 1 GeV . On the other\ncontrary, AGILE is optimized in the range below 1 GeV with emphasis to the\nsimultaneous hard X-ray/gamma-ray imaging with arcminute angular resolution. The GLAST large gamma-ray effective area allows deep pointings and\ngood imaging within a few arcminutes for strong gamma-ray sources. AGILE\nhas a gamma-ray effective area near 100 MeV smaller by a factor of \u223c 4 compared to the upper portion of the LAT instrument on board of GLAST. However, it can reach arcminute positioning of sources because of Super-AGILE.\nFurthermore, the GLAST sky-scanning mode adopted during the first phase\n\n\fM. Tavani et al.,\n\nAGILE in orbit\n\n17\n\nof the mission, and the AGILE fixed pointing strategy offer a way for joint\ninvestigations. In the overlapping pointed regions, strong time variability of\ngamma-ray sources (1-2 day timescale) can be very effectively studied simultaneously by the two missions. AGILE with its hard X-ray imager can also\nprovide additional and very useful information.\nThe most relevant feature of AGILE is its unique combination of a largeFOV hard X-ray imager together with a gamma-ray imager. AGILE will be\nable to reach arcminute positioning of sources emitting in the hard X-ray range\nabove 10 mCrab. Furthermore, AGILE can react to transients, and can point\nat gamma-ray sources detected by other missions to position the source within\nthe FOV of both the GRID and SA. Interesting gamma-ray transients detected\nby GLAST might then be pointed by AGILE for a broad-band study of their\ntemporal and spectral properties.\n4\n\nScientific Objectives\n\nCurrently, nearly 300 gamma-ray sources above 30 MeV were detected (with\nonly a small fraction, 30%, identified as AGNs or isolated pulsars) [17, 32,\n33, 34]. AGILE fits into the discovery path followed by previous gamma-ray\nmissions (SAS-2, COS-B, and EGRET) and be complementary to GLAST. We\nsummarize here the main AGILE's scientific objectives.\n\u2022 Active Galactic Nuclei. For the first time, simultaneous monitoring of a\nlarge number of AGNs per pointing will be possible. Several outstanding issues\nconcerning the mechanism of AGN gamma-ray production and activity can be\naddressed by AGILE including: (1) the study of transient vs. low-level gammaray emission and duty-cycles [35]; (2) the relationship between the gammaray variability and the radio-optical-X-ray-TeV emission; (3) the correlation\nbetween relativistic radio plasmoid ejections and gamma-ray flares; (4) hard\nX-ray/gamma-ray correlations. A program for joint AGILE and ground-based\nmonitoring observations is being planned. On the average, AGILE will achieve\ndeep exposures of AGNs and substantially improve our knowledge on the lowlevel emission as well as detecting flares. We conservatively estimate that for\na 3-year program AGILE will detect a number of AGNs 2\u20133 times larger than\nthat of EGRET. Super-AGILE will monitor, for the first time, simultaneous\nAGN emission in the gamma-ray and hard X-ray ranges.\n\u2022 Gamma-ray bursts. A few GRBs were detected by the EGRET spark\nchamber [21]. This number appears to be limited by the EGRET FOV and\nsensitivity and probably not by the intrinsic GRB emission mechanism. GRB\ndetection rate by the AGILE-GRID is expected to be at least a factor of \u223c\n5 larger than that of EGRET, i.e., \u22655\u201310 events/year). The small GRID\ndeadtime (\u223c 500 times smaller than that of EGRET) allows a better study\nof the initial phase of GRB pulses (for which EGRET response was in many\n\n\f18\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\ncases inadequate). The remarkable discovery of 'delayed' gamma-ray emission\nup to \u223c 20 GeV from GRB 940217 [18] is of great importance to model burst\nacceleration processes. AGILE is expected to be efficient in detecting photons\nabove 10 GeV because of limited backsplashing. Super-AGILE will be able\nto locate GRBs within a few arcminutes, and will systematically study the\ninterplay between hard X-ray and gamma-ray emissions. Special emphasis will\nbe given to the search for sub-millisecond GRB pulses independently detectable\nby the Si-Tracker, MCAL and Super-AGILE.\n\u2022 Diffuse Galactic and extragalactic emission. The AGILE good angular resolution and large average exposure will further improve our knowledge\nof cosmic ray origin, propagation, interaction and emission processes. We also\nnote that a joint study of gamma-ray emission from MeV to TeV energies is\npossible by special programs involving AGILE and new-generation TeV observatories of improved angular resolution.\n\u2022 Gamma-ray pulsars. AGILE will contribute to the study of gammaray pulsars (PSRs) in several ways: (1) improving timing and lightcurves of\nknown gamma-ray PSRs; (2) improving photon statistics for gamma-ray period\nsearches; (3) studying unpulsed gamma-ray emission from plerions in supernova\nremnants and studying pulsar wind/nebula interactions, e.g., as in the Galactic\nsources recently discovered in the TeV range[1]. Particularly interesting for\nAGILE are the \u223c 30 new young PSRs discovered [19] in the Galactic plane by\nthe Parkes survey.\n\u2022 Search for non-blazar gamma-ray variable sources in the Galactic plane, currently a new class of unidentified gamma-ray sources such as\nGRO J1838-04 [24].\n\u2022 Galactic sources, micro-quasars, new transients. A large number of\ngamma-ray sources near the Galactic plane are unidentified, and sources such\nas 2CG 135+1/LS I 61 +61 303 can be monitored on timescales of months. Cyg\nX-1 will be also monitored and gamma-ray emission above 30 MeV will be intensively searched. Galactic X-ray jet sources (such as Cyg X-3, GRS 1915+10,\nGRO J1655-40 and others) can produce detectable gamma-ray emission for\nfavorable jet geometries, and a TOO program is planned to follow-up new\ndiscoveries of micro-quasars.\n\u2022 Fundamental Physics: Quantum Gravity. AGILE detectors are\nsuited for Quantum Gravity studies [30]. The existence of sub-millisecond\nGRB pulses lasting hundreds of microseconds [9] opens the way to study QG\ndelay propagation effects by AGILE detectors. Particularly important is the\nAGILE Mini-Calorimeter with independent readout for each of the 30 CsI bars\nof small deadtime (\u223c 20 \u03bcs) and absolute timing resolution (\u223c 3 \u03bcs). Energy\ndependent time delays near \u223c 100 \u03bcs for ultra-short GRB pulses in the energy\nrange 0.3\u20133 MeV can be detected. If these GRB ultra-short pulses originate at\ncosmological distances, sensitivity to the Planck's mass can be reached [30].\n\n\fM. Tavani et al.,\n\nAGILE in orbit\n\n19\n\nFigure 10: An example of a sequence of AGILE pointings showing the very\nlarge gamma-ray field of view (in Galactic coordinates).\n\n5\n\nThe Mission\n\n5.1 Satellite operations\nThe AGILE spacecraft is of the MITA class and is developed by Carlo Gavazzi\nSpace (CGS) as prime contractor and by Oerlikon-Contraves. The spacecraft\nprovides a 3-axis stabilization with an accuracy near 0.5\u20131 degree.\nThe\nfinal satellite pointing reconstruction is required to reach an accuracy of \u223c1\narcmin by a set of two Star Sensors. A GPS transceiver will also ensure an onboard timing accuracy within 2 microseconds. The AGILE scientific instrument\ngenerates under normal conditions a telemetry rate of \u223c 50 kbit/s. The satellite\ndownlink telemetry rate is 512 kbit s\u22121 , that is adequate to transmit at every\npassage over the ground station all the satellite and scientific data.\nThe fixed solar panels configuration and the necessity to have them always\nexposed to the Sun imposes some constraints on the AGILE pointing strategy. However, in practice the AGILE large FOV does not sensibly limit the\naccessible sky: only the solar and anti-solar directions are excluded from direct\npointings. The AGILE Pointing Plan is being finalized and will be ready in\nadvance before the start of Cycle-1 (first year). AGILE might react to transient\n\n\f20\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nevents of great importance occurring outside the accessible FOV. For transients\ndetected by the AGILE-GRID and not by Super-AGILE, a minor re-pointing\n(20-30 degrees) is envisioned to allow the coverage of the gamma-ray transient also by the X-ray imager within 1 day. A drastic re-pointing strategy\n(Target-of-Opportunity, TOO) is foreseen for events of major scientific relevance detected by other observatories.\n\n5.2 The Orbit\nThe AGILE orbit is quasi equatorial, with an inclination of 2.5 degrees from the\nEquator and average altitude of 540 km. A low earth orbit (LEO) of small inclination is a clear plus of the mission because of the reduced particle background\nas verified in orbit by all instrument detectors. Also a low-inclination orbit\noptmizes the use of the ASI communication ground base at Malindi (Kenya).\n6\n\nThe AGILE Science Program\n\nAGILE is a Small Scientific Mission with a science program open to the international scientific community. The AGILE Mission Board (AMB) oversees\nthe scientific program, determines the pointing strategy, and authorizes Target of Opportunity (TOO) observations in case of exceptional transients. A\nsubstantial fraction of the gamma-ray data will be available for the AGILE\nGuest Observer Program (GOP) that will be open to the international community on a competitive basis. The AGILE Cycle-1 GOP is scheduled to start\nin December, 2007.\n6.1 Data Analysis and Scientific Ground Segment\nAGILE science data (about 300 Mbit/orbit) are telemetered from the satellite\nto the ASI ground station in Malindi (Kenya) at every satellite passage (about\n90 minutes). A fast ASINET connection between Malindi and the Telespazio\nSatellite Control Center at Fucino and then between Fucino and the ASI Science Data Center (ASDC) ensures the data transmission every orbit. The\nAGILE Mission Operations Center is located at Fucino and will be operated\nby Telespazio with scientific and programmatic input by ASI and the AGILE\nScience Team through the ASDC.\nScientific data storage, quicklook analysis and the GOP will be carried out\nat ASDC. After pre-processing, scientific data (level-1) will be corrected for\nsatellite attitude data and processed by dedicated software produced by the\nAGILE Team in collaboration with ASDC personnel. Background rejection\nand photon list determination are the main outputs of this first stage of processing. Level-2 data will be at this point available for a full scientific analysis.\n\n\fM. Tavani et al.,\n\nAGILE in orbit\n\n21\n\nGamma-ray data generated by the GRID will be analyzed by special software\nproducing: (1) sky-maps, (2) energy spectra, (3) exposure, (4) point-source\nanalysis products, and (5) diffuse gamma-ray emission. This software is aimed\nto allow the user to perform a complete science analysis of specific pointlike\ngamma-ray sources or candidates. This software will be available for the GOP.\nSuper-AGILE data will be deconvolved and processed to produce 2-D sky images through a correlation of current and archival data of hard X-ray sources.\nGRB data will activate dedicated software producing lightcurves, spectra and\npositioning both in the hard X-ray (18 \u2013 60 keV) and gamma-ray energy (30\nMeV \u2013 30 GeV) ranges. The AGILE data processing goals can be summarized\nas follows:\n\u2022 Quicklook Analysis (QA) of all gamma-ray and hard X-ray data,\naimed at a fast scientific processing (within a few hours/1 day depending\non source intensity) of all AGILE science data.\n\u2022 web-availability of QA results to the international community for\nalerts and rapid follow-up observations;\n\u2022 GRB positioning and alerts through the AGILE Fast Link, capable of producing alerts within 1-2 minutes since the event;\n\u2022 standard science analysis of specific gamma-ray sources open to\na Guest Observer Program;\n\u2022 web-availability of the standard analysis results of the hard Xray monitoring program by Super-AGILE.\n6.2 Multiwavelength Observations Program\nThe scientific impact of a high-energy Mission such as AGILE (broad-band\nenergy coverage, very large fields of view) is greatly increased if an efficient\nprogram for fast follow-up and/or monitoring observations by ground-based\nand space instruments is carried out. The AGILE Science Program overlaps\nand be complementary to those of many other high-energy space Missions (INTEGRAL, XMM-Newton, Chandra, SWIFT, Suzaku , GLAST) and groundbased instrumentation.\nThe AGILE Science Program will involve a large astronomy and astrophysics community and emphasizes a quick reaction to transients and a rapid\ncommunication of crucial data. Past experience shows that in many occasions\nthere was no fast reaction to \u03b3-ray transients (within a few hours/days for\nunidentified gamma-ray sources) that could not be identified. AGILE will take\nadvantage, in a crucial way, of the combination of its gamma-ray and hard\nX-ray imagers.\n\n\f22\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nAn AGILE Science Group (ASG) aims at favoring the scientific collaboration between the AGILE Team and the community especially for coordinating\nmultiwavelength observations based on AGILE detections and alerts. The ASG\nis open to the international astrophysics community and consists of the AGILE Team and qualified researchers contributing with their data and expertise\nin optimizing the scientific return of the Mission. Several working groups are\noperational on a variety of scientific topics including blazars, GRBs, pulsars,\nand Galactic compact objects. The AGILE Team is also open to collaborations\nwith individual observing groups.\nUpdated documentation on the AGILE Mission can be found at the web\nsites http://asdc.asi.it, and http://agile.iasf-roma.inaf.it.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe AGILE program is developed under the auspices of the Italian Space\nAgency with co-participation by the Italian Institute of Astrophysics (INAF)\nand by the Italian Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN). Research partially\nsupported under the grant ASI-I/R/045/04. We acknowledge the crucial programmatic support of the ASI Directors of the Observation of the Universe\nUnit (S.

The main detector is a silicon-tungsten tracker. Its structure\nand assembly are described in this paper. ).\n\n1\n\nThe AGILE detector\n\nThe AGILE satellite (fig. 1) was launched by the PSLV rocket from the Sriharikota base in India on April 23, 2007[1]. The scientific instrument is made\nby four detectors: an anticoincidence system, made of 12 lateral panels\nand 1 top panel of plastic scintillators read out by photomultipliers, the Xray detector Superagile with a silicon microstrip detection plane made of 16\nsilicon microstrip tiles (strip pitch is 121 \u03bcm) read by XAA1 chips[2], a little\ncalorimeter made of 30 CsI scintillating bars in orthogonal directions, read\nout by photodiodes[3] and the silicon-tungsten tracker.\n25\n\n\f26\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 1: Picture of the integrated satellite.\n\nFigure 2: The silicon tracker before the integration with the payload and the\nflight DAQ (June 2005)\n\n\fG.Barbiellini et al.\n\n2\n\nThe AGILE Silicon Tracker\n\n27\n\nThe AGILE Silicon Tracker\n\nThe silicon tracker (see fig. 2) consists of 12 planes with two views of 16 silicon\nmicrostrip tiles (Hamamatsu), organized in 4 modules (\"ladders\") of 4 tiles.\nThe two views are positioned orthogonally one with respect to the other in order\nto obtain a x-y imaging system and the planes are organized in 13 mechanical\ntrays. The first 10 planes have a 245 \u03bcm (corresponding to about 0.07 X0 )\nthick tungsten layer for the photon conversion.\nEach tile consists of a 9.5\u00d79.5 cm2 AC-coupled 410 \u03bcm thick 384 silicon\nstrip detector. The 4 ladder tiles are connected in series strip by strip through\n25 \u03bcm thick aluminium ultrasonic wire bondings. The strip physical pitch is\n121 \u03bcm, while the readout one is 242 \u03bcm with one floating strip in order to\nreduce the number of electronics channels and thus the power consumption\nwhile maintaining a good spatial resolution.\n\nFigure 3: Picture of the TAA1 frontend chip\nThe readout ASIC is the TAA1 (fig. 3), a 128 channel, low noise, low\npower, self triggering ASIC designed by Ideas (Norway) and produced by AMS\n(Austria) with a 0.8 \u03bcm N-well BiCMOS, double poly, double metal on epitaxial\nlayer technology. To limit the power consumption of the Tracker, the ASIC is\noperated in a very low power configuration (< 400 \u03bcW per channel). The die\nis 5.174 \u00d7 6.919 mm2 and \u223c 600 \u03bcm thick. The 128 input pads have a 100 \u03bcm\npitch and have been bonded to the PCB (Printed Circuit Board) lines with a\n\n\f28\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n17.5 \u03bcm thick aluminium wire, while a 25 \u03bcm one has been used to bond the\n41 output, control and power 200 \u03bcm pitch pads.\nThe HDI (High Density Interconnection) is the circuit that interconnects\nthe ladder ASICs and the detectors to the readout electronics. It consists of a\nten layer FR4 PCB designed by INFN Trieste (Italy) and produced by ILFA\nGmbH (Hannover, Germany). One of the layers is a 38 cm long kapton foil\nextending outside the PCB (fig. 4) which is used both as a mechanical support\nfor the silicon detectors and to provide the bias to the detectors themselves.\nThe four silicon tiles are glued (see fig. 5) on the HDI and then bonded to form\none silicon ladder (fig. 6). The ladders are then glued on the opposite sides of\nthe support trays.\n\nFigure 4: Picture of the HDI PCB. The 38 cm long kapton cable for the bias\nis clearly visible; the HDI output is connected to the temporary adapter for\ntesting.\n\nFigure 5: Glue dispenser during the preparation of the kapton layer for the\nsilicon ladder.\nEach tray (Oerlikon-Contraves, fig. 7 is made of a 15 mm thick aluminium\nhoneycomb core with a 0.5 mm carbon fiber layer per side. The tungsten foil\nis glued on to the bottom part of the first 10 trays.\n\n\fG.Barbiellini et al.\n\nThe AGILE Silicon Tracker\n\n29\n\nFigure 6: A ladder during the mechanical measurements\n\nFigure 7: A tray with the four ladders glued on one of the views.\n3\n\nThe assembly steps\n\nThe prototype and flight model assemblies have been performed by Mipot\nS.p.A. (Cormons, Italy).\nThe assembly steps can be divided into four groups:\n\u2022 Assembly of the passive components and of the ASICs on the HDIs\n(fig. 4). The following operations are performed on the PCBs, once\nthey have passed the incoming inspection: tin soldering of the passive\ncomponents (MIL-883 resistors and capacitors); gluing and bonding of\na temporary adapter for the connection to the test equipment; gluing\n(Epotek H20E), bonding and conformal coating (RTV615) of the ASICs;\n\n\f30\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\ngluing of the FR4 covers; final 72 hour test in a thermo-vacuum chamber\nwith temperatures ranging from -30\u25e6 C to +50\u25e6 C; each cycle lasts 2 hours.\n\u2022 Assembly of the silicon ladder. Four tiles are glued head-on (AV138)\nand the so obtained silicon ladder is glued on the HDI kapton (Epotek\nH20E on the gold dots for the elctrical connection to the bias voltage and\nDC3145 on the rest) (fig. 4c, fig. 6). The head-on gluing between the first\nsilicon tile and the HDI is made with three segments of AV138 separated\nby RTV615, to avoid breaking caused by eventual thermal gradients. The\nstrips are then bonded together between the four silicon tiles and between\nthe HDI and the first silicon tile. The bondings are protected with an\nepoxy dam (2216) filled with RTV615 (fig. 4c).\n\u2022 Tray assembly. Four ladders are glued first on the bottom side of a\ntray and then on the top view (fig. 7). The adapters are taken away\nand the cable to connect the frontend to the readout electronics (MLC,\nMultiLayer Connection) is fixed with screws and glued. The HDI and the\nMLC are bonded with 25 \u03bcm Al wire and the bondings are protected as\nin the silicon ladder case.\n\u2022 The 13 trays are assembled together with the mechanical supports, obtaining the Silicon Tracker (fig. 2).\nAfter the prototype performance studies, the final flight version of the\nTracker has been assembled in one year. A large number of tests (e.g. mechanical measurements, thermo-vacuum cycling tests, electrical and functional\ntests) have been performed on every Tracker element at every assembly step.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe silicon tracker, core of the AGILE GRID detector, was assembled and\ntested in one year. The Hamamatsu silicon detectors and the IDEAS front-end\nelectronics have proved to fullfill the design requirements. The capability of\nAGILE to detect of gamma-rays over a large field of view with optimal spatial\nresolution of electron-positron pairs is based on the excellent performance of\nthis detector.\nReferences\n[1] M.

Here I provide a short\ndescription of the experiment and report its status before lunch, as derived from the on-ground tests and calibrations, and after the first two\nmonths of operation in space.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAGILE [1], a small mission of the Italian Space Agency (ASI), was injected by\na PSLV rocket from India on 23rd April 2007 in a \u223c2\u25e6 .5 inclination orbit at\n\u223c545 km altitude. The AGILE scientific payload is composed of a Gamma Ray\nImaging Detector (GRID) - based on a silicon tracker, a CsI \"mini\" calorimeter and a plastic anticoincidence - and a hard X-ray (\u223c18-60 keV) monitor,\nSuperAGILE. The simultaneous observation of the gamma-ray sources with an\ninstrument operating in hard X-rays, an energy range where higher sensitivity and better angular resolution can be achieved, can improve the chance of\ndetecting and identify the gamma ray sources, with the benefit of correlating\nthe simultaneous emission in two distant energy bands. This was the main\nscientific driver for including SuperAGILE in the AGILE payload. However,\nwith a good sensitivity and a very large field of view, SuperAGILE also operates as an independent wide field monitor of the hard X-ray sky, allowing the\nsimultaneous monitoring of several known Galactic sources and possibly the\ndiscovery of new transient sources.\n31\n\n\f32\n2\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nThe SuperAGILE Experiment onboard AGILE\n\nSuperAGILE [2] is an experiment based on the coded mask technique, imaging\nthe X-ray sky in the energy range \u223c18-60 keV. The field of view is larger than\none steradian, and the on axis angular resolution is 6 arcminutes. Each of\nthe four detection units performs one-dimensional imaging, in two orthogonal\ndirections in the sky, with redundancy for both coordinates. The primary\nscientific goal of SuperAGILE is to provide a rapid and accurate identification\nof the gamma-ray sources observed with the GRID. This is a task that, based\non the current knowledge, can be accomplished on a few classes of sources\n(gamma-ray pulsars, blazars, gamma-ray bursts). However, with an on-axis\nsensitivity of \u223c15 mCrab (for a 50 ks net exposure) and field of view of 2\u00d7\n(107\u25e6 \u00d768\u25e6 ) (zero response), SuperAGILE will also operate as a (quasi) all sky\nmonitor of the X-ray sky. In Table 1 the main instrument parameters are\nsummarized. A more detailed description of the SuperAGILE experiment may\nbe found in [2].\nTable 1: Main instrumental parameters of the SuperAGILE experiment.\n\n3\n\nInstrument Parameter\n\nValue\n\nDetector\nEnergy Range\nEnergy Resolution\nGeometric Area\n1D Field of View\n2x1D Field of View\nMask Transparency\nAngular Resolution\nMask Element Size\nMask-Detector Distance\nTiming Resolution\nTiming Accuracy\nPoint Source Location Accuracy\nPoint Source Sensitivity\nData Transmission\n\n410 \u03bcm thick Si \u03bc-strip\n18-60 keV\n\u223c8 keV FWHM\n1344 cm2\n2\u00d7(107\u25e6\u00d768\u25e6 )\n68\u25e6 \u00d768\u25e6\n50%\n6 arcmin\n242 \u03bcm\n142 mm\n2 \u03bcs\n5 \u03bcs\n1-2 arcmin\n15 mCrab (1D)\nEvent-by-Event, 32-bit/event\n\nThe Ground Calibrations\n\nThe SuperAGILE experiment underwent a series of ground calibration campaigns. The naked Detection Plane was calibrated on June 2005 at IASF\n\n\fMarco Feroci\n\nSuperAGILE\n\n33\n\nFigure 1: The detector images taken with one SuperAGILE detector during\nthe ground calibration when illuminated with a 22 keV source at 20 and 30\ndegrees (left and right panels, respectively).\n\nRome, by scanning the detectors with a pencil beam obtained by collimating\nthe beam from an X-ray tube, and illuminating it with omnidirectional radioactive sources. On August 2005 the complete experiment was again scanned with\nthe pencil beam (simulating an infinite distance source) and illuminating with\nradioactive sources at \u223c2 m distance, correcting for the beam divergence in\norder to derive the response from an infinite distance source. Finally, the\nexperiment was again calibrated after its integration in the satellite with radioactive sources at finite distance on January 2007 at the Carlo Gavazzi Space\npremises in Tortona (AL, Italy). The results of the 2005 calibrations may be\nfound in [3] and [4].\nThe results of the 2007 calibration will be reported in a dedicated paper.\nHere we show a few snapshots, providing a feeling of the data quality. In\nFigure 1 the detector images obtained with a 22 keV source at 20 and 30\ndegrees off-axis are shown. The plots clearly show the obscuration effect of the\ncollimator, as well as the open/closed pattern of the coded mask (shadowgram).\nThe smaller structure appearing at the separation between the obscured section\nof the image and the mask shadowgram is due to support structures partially\nobstructing the SuperAGILE field of vew. When the de-convolution with the\ncode of the mask and the finite-distance correction are applied to these data the\nsource is imaged as shown in Figure 2, showing the 6 arcminutes point spread\nfunction of the experiment (here slightly increased by the finite extension of\nthe radionuclide in the radioactive source, not subtracted here).\n\n\f34\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 2: Source image obtained by the detector images shown in Figure 1, after\nthe correction for the finite distance and the mask de-convolution process.\n\n\fMarco Feroci\n\n4\n\nSuperAGILE\n\n35\n\nFirst News from Above\n\nAfter the April 2007 launch, the in-flight commissioning phase of SuperAGILE\nstarted on May 3rd . Within the first two months of commissioning only 31\nuseful ground contacts (effectively, one week of satellite operation) were allocated for sending SuperAGILE commands. The commissioning was thus not\nyet completed at the time of this conference. The main activities carried out\nwere: gradual switch-on of the experiment; health check-out (successful!); setting of \u223chalf of the digital parameters; configuration of the analog thresholds\nof most of the channels; configuration of the timing with the veto systems.\nAll of this activities were carried out, upon our request, pointing the experiment boresight to a \"blank\" field (that is, a field where no X-ray sources are\nexpected at a flux level above the SuperAGILE sensitivity), to be able to set\nthe instrument parameters without contamination of the count rate by celestial\nsources (except for those contributing to the diffuse X-ray background). The\nfirst light of the experiment is then expected, after completion of the check-out\nand setting activities, on the field of Vela.\nThe type of activities carried out in this first phase of the SuperAGILE in\nflight operation does not allow to have results other than of engineering type.\nIn Figure 3 we show the count rate recorded by one of the four SuperAGILE\ndetectors during a typical orbit. The plots show the rate in 16s integration\nbins of the 4 \"daisy chains\", the basic electronic units composing each of the 4\nSuperAGILE detectors. In practice, this is the count rate over 384 strips (1/4\nof one detector), in 16 seconds. The plots show the main features registered\nalong one orbit: the \"de-occultation\" of the experiment field of view by the\nEarth (the step-like feature at the beginning of the orbit), and the effect of the\ndead-time induced by the very high count rate of the AGILE anticoincidence\nduring the passage through the South Atlantic Anomaly (the sudden decrease\nof counts towards the end of the orbit).\nThe Earth occultation of the field of view is best seen in the panel bottom\nleft, due to the lower energy threshold of this daisy chain at the time of the\nmeasurement (at this stage, the energy threshold equalization process had not\nbeen completed yet). This effect allows to derive the net effect of the diffuse\nX-ray background, by comparing the on-Earth to the off-Earth energy spectra.\nIndeed, in this comparison also the Earth albedo plays a role when the instrument is looking at the Earth, so the difference is expected to be attenuated.\nThis comparison is shown in Figure 4.\nIn Figure 5 we show an effect of the passage through the South Atlantic\nAnomaly. Here the \"raw\" SuperAGILE count rate is reported, as it is recorded\nbefore the energy and anticoincidence cuts are applied. The plot shows a sequence of more than 80 consecutive orbits. At each orbit the satellite crosses\nthe South Atlantic Anomaly at a different depth, due to the precession of the\nsatellite orbit over the geomagnetic Earth. At a different depth in the South\n\n\f36\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 3: The count rate (cts/16s) of one SuperAGILE detection unit over a\ntypical orbit.

For this reason, the rate increase during the crossing of the\nSouth Atlantic Anomaly is clearly visible (each vertical line is an orbit, here).\n\n5\n\nConclusions and Perspectives\n\nAs explained in the previous sections, despite the two months elapsed between\nthis conference and the launch of the AGILE satellite, the SuperAGILE commissioning phase is not yet completed. Then, the near future will be spent in\ncompleting the experiment setting and then the Science Verification Phase will\nbegin. The current scheduled period for this phase is from July to September\n2007. During this phase SuperAGILE is expected to have its first light pointing to fields with usually bright X-ray sources, the Vela field and the Cignus\nregion. Then, the in-flight calibration plan foresees a raster scan using the\nCrab nebula, that is observing this standard source at different off-axis angles,\nin order to map the experiment response at several locations over the field of\n\n\f38\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nview. Due to the tight Sun-angle constraints of AGILE (solar panels at 90\u00b11\ndegrees from the Sun), this scan will span a very long (not continuous) period,\nstarting at the beginning of August and ending on November.\nDuring these pointings the main goal will be to study and calibrating the\nimaging response, especially for what concerns the attitude correction, both\nonboard and in the on-ground data analysis, with the real aspect precession.\nIn fact, the AGILE attitude varies by more than one SuperAGILE pixel every\nsecond. The data from the Star Trackers allow to know the real pointing at the\narcminute level every tenth of a second. These data are then used to correct\nthe arrival direction of each individual photon, and almost-fully exploit the\nSuperAGILE capabilities demonstrated by the on ground calibrations. This\nwill be particularly important to fulfill the scientific objectives concerning the\nprompt response to cosmic gamma-ray bursts (see [5] and [2] for details).\nReferences\n[1] M.

Moskalenko\nHansen Experimental Physics Laboratory and Kavli Institute for Particle\nAstrophysics and Cosmology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, U.S.A.\n\nAbstract\nThe detection of high-energy particles, cosmic rays (CRs), deep inside\nthe heliosphere implies that there are, at least, three distinctly different\nstages in the lifetime of a CR particle: acceleration, propagation in the\ninterstellar medium (ISM), and propagation in the heliosphere. Gamma\nrays produced by interactions of CRs with gas, radiation, and magnetic\nfields can be used to study their spectra in different locations. Still, accurate direct measurements of CR species inside the heliosphere (such as\ntheir spectra and abundances) are extremely important for the understanding of their origin and propagation. In this paper, an emphasis is\nmade on very recent advances and especially on those where GLAST and\nPAMELA observations can lead to further progress in our understanding\nof CRs.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nCosmic rays and \u03b3-rays are intrinsically connected: \u03b3-ray emission is a direct\nprobe of proton and lepton spectra and intensities in distant locations of the\nGalaxy. Diffuse emission accounts for \u223c80% of the total \u03b3-ray luminosity of\nthe Milky Way and is a tracer of interactions of CR particles in the ISM [1]. On\nthe other hand, direct measurements of CR species can be used to probe CR\npropagation, to derive propagation parameters, and to test various hypotheses\n39\n\n\f40\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n[2]. Luckily, two missions of the present and near future are targeting these\nissues and present unique opportunities for breakthroughs. The Payload for\nAntimatter-Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA) [3]\nhas been launched in June 2006 and is currently in orbit. During its projected\n3 yr lifetime it will measure light CR nuclei, antiprotons, and positrons in the\nenergy range 50 MeV/n \u2013 300 GeV/n with high precision. The Gamma-ray\nLarge Area Space Telescope (GLAST) [4] is scheduled for launch in early 2008.\nIt has significantly improved sensitivity, angular resolution, and much larger\nfield of view than its predecessor EGRET and will provide excellent quality\ndata in the energy range 20 MeV \u2013 300 GeV.\n2\n\nCosmic-ray accelerators\n\nA supernova (SN) \u2013 CR connection has been discussed since the mid-1930s\nwhen Baade and Zwicky proposed that SNe are responsible for the observed\nCR flux. The first direct evidence of particle acceleration up to very high\nenergies (VHE) came from observations of synchrotron X-rays from the supernova remnant (SNR) SN1006 [5]. More recently, observations of TeV \u03b3-rays [6]\nconfirm the existence of VHE particles. Still, definitive proof that SNRs are\naccelerating protons is absent. Recent observations of the SNR RX J1713 by\nHESS suggest that its spectrum is consistent with the decay of pions produced\nin pp-interactions [6], while the spectrum from inverse Compton scattering\n(ICS) does not seem to fit the observations. However, a calculation of ICS\nand synchrotron emission using a one-zone model [7] and a new calculation\nof the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) shows that a leptonic origin is also\nconsistent with the data [8]. Another interesting case study is the composite\nSNR G0.9+0.1 near the Galactic center [9] which can also be fitted using the\nleptonic model [8]. In this instance, the major contribution comes from ICS\noff optical photons while the \u03b3-ray spectrum exhibits a \"universal\" cutoff in\nthe VHE regime due to the Klein-Nishina effect. If this modelling is correct,\nGLAST observations can be used to probe the ISRF in the Galactic center.\nObservations of SNRs by GLAST will be vital in distinguishing between leptonic or hadronic scenarios as their predictions for the spectral shape in the\nGeV energy range are distinctly different.\nA new calculation of the ISRF shows that it is more intense than previously\nthought, especially in the inner Galaxy where the optical and infrared photon\ndensity exceeds that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by a factor\nof 100 [8]. For a source in the inner Galaxy, properly accounting for inverse\nCompton energy losses flattens the electron spectrum in the source compared\nto the case of pure synchrotron energy losses [10]. This effect leads to a flatter\nintrinsic \u03b3-ray spectrum at the source. On the other hand, the intense ISRF\nalso leads to \u03b3\u03b3-attenuation which starts at much lower energies than for the\n\n\fIgor V. Moskalenko\n\nOrigin and propagation of cosmic rays\n\n41\n\nCMB alone [11]. For VHE \u03b3-ray sources located in the inner Galaxy, the\nattenuation effects should be seen for energies \u223c30 TeV [12].\nA new class of VHE \u03b3-ray sources and thus CR accelerators, close binaries,\nhas been recently found by HESS [13]. The observed orbital modulation due\nto the \u03b3\u03b3-attenuation on optical photons of a companion star testifies that\nthe VHE \u03b3-ray emission is produced near the compact object. Such an effect\nhas been predicted long ago in a series of papers [14], where the light curves\nwere calculated for binaries which were suspected to be VHE emitters at that\ntime, like Cyg X-3. The phase of the maximum of the emission depends on the\neccentricity of the orbit and its orientation; for orbital parameters of LS 5039 it\nis about 0.7 [14], in agreement with observations. For a recent discussion of the\norbital modulation in LS 5039, see [15]. GLAST observations in the GeV\u2013TeV\nrange will be the key to understanding the emission mechanism(s).\n3\n\nPropagation of cosmic rays and diffuse gamma-ray emission\n\n3.1 Particle propagation near the sources\nDiffuse \u03b3-ray emission in the TeV energy range has been recently observed\nby HESS [16] from the Galactic center. The emission clearly correlates with\nthe gas column density as traced by CS. If this emission is associated with a\nrelatively young SNR, say Sgr A East, observation of the individual clouds will\ntell us about CR propagation there. A simple back-of-the-envelope calculation\nshows that if the SNR age is <10 kyr and the shock speed is <104 km/s,\nthe shell size should be <100 pc, while the emission is observed from distant\nclouds up to 200 pc from the Galactic center. The emission outside the shock,\ntherefore, has to be produced by protons which were accelerated by the shock\nand left it some time ago. The spectrum of such particles can be approximated\nby a \u03b4-function in energy which depends on the SNR age; the resulting \u03b3-ray\nspectrum is essentially flatter than expected from a power-law proton spectrum\nin the shell (Figure 1) [17, 18]. Observations of individual clouds in the GLAST\nenergy range will be a direct probe of this model and thus of proton acceleration\nin SNRs.\nMilagro has recently observed the diffuse emission at 12 TeV from the\nCygnus region [19]. The observed emission, after subtraction of point sources\ncorrelates with gas column density. The VHE \u03b3-ray flux is found to be larger\nthan predicted by the conventional and even optimized model tuned to fit the\nGeV excess [25]. This may imply that freshly accelerated particles interact with\nthe local gas, but other possibilities such as ICS or unresolved point sources\ncan not be excluded on the base of Milagro observations alone.\nThese observations show that the diffuse emission exists even at VHE energies and variations in brightness are large. A contribution of Galactic CRs to\nthe diffuse emission in this energy range is still significant.

The solid line is the\ntotal spectrum. Data: HESS observations of the Galactic center ridge [6].\ndiffuse emission may be used to study CR propagation and their penetration\ninto molecular clouds. GLAST is ideally suited to address these issues.\n3.2 Galactic cosmic rays\nPropagation in the ISM changes the initial spectra and composition of CR\nspecies due to spallation, energy losses, energy gain (e.g., diffusive reacceleration), and other processes (e.g., diffusion, convection). The destruction of\nprimary nuclei via spallation gives rise to secondary nuclei and isotopes which\nare rare in nature (i.e., Li, Be, B), antiprotons, pions and kaons that decay\nproducing secondary leptons and \u03b3-rays. Studies of stable secondary nuclei\n(Li, Be, B, Sc, Ti, V) allow the ratio (halo size)/(diffusion coefficient) to be\ndetermined and the incorporation of radioactive secondaries (10 Be, 26 Al, 36 Cl,\n54\nMn) is used to find the diffusion coefficient and the halo size separately. For\na recent review on CR propagation see [2].\nMeasurement of the B/C ratio with a single instrument and in a wide energy\nrange is long overdue. The best data >0.8 GeV/n to-date are those taken by\n\n\fIgor V. Moskalenko\n\nOrigin and propagation of cosmic rays\n\n43\n\nthe HEAO-3 experiment more than 25 years ago, while modern spacecraft,\ne.g., ACE, provide high quality data at low energies 150\u2013450 MeV/n [20]. The\nsharp maximum in the B/C ratio observed at \u223c1 GeV/n is difficult to explain\nin a physical model and has been long debated; it may well be an instrumental\nartefact. On the other hand, the high energy tail of the B/C ratio is sensitive\nto the rigidity dependence of the diffusion coefficient and thus its accurate\nmeasurement can be used to distinguish between models of CR propagation in\nthe ISM. The PAMELA has the capability of measuring the B/C ratio in the\nenergy range 100 MeV/n \u2013 250 GeV/n and will address both issues.\nThe majority of CR antiprotons observed near the Earth are secondaries\nproduced in collisions of CRs with interstellar gas. Because of the kinematics\nof this process, the spectrum of antiprotons has a unique shape distinguishing\nit from other CR species. It peaks at \u223c2 GeV decreasing sharply toward lower\nenergies. Because of their high production threshold and the unique spectral\nshape antiprotons can be used to probe CR propagation in the ISM and the\nheliosphere, and to test the local Galactic average proton spectrum (for a discussion and references see [21]). Because the pp (and p\u0304p) total inelastic cross\nsection is ten times smaller than that of carbon, the ratio p\u0304/p can be used to\nderive the diffusion coefficient in a much larger Galactic volume than the B/C\nratio. The CR p\u0304 spectrum may also contain signatures of exotic processes, such\nas, e.g., WIMP annihilation. However, currently available data (mostly from\nBESS flights [22]) are not accurate enough, while published estimates of the\nexpected flux differ significantly; in particular, the reacceleration model underproduces antiprotons by a factor of \u223c2 at 2 GeV [21]. Secondary CR positrons\nare produced in the same interactions as antiprotons and are potentially able\nto contribute to the same topics. Accurate measurements of the CR e+ spectrum may also reveal features associated with the sources of primary positrons,\nsuch as pulsars. During its lifetime, PAMELA will measure CR antiprotons\nand positrons in the energy range 50 MeV \u2013 250 GeV with high precision [23].\nIndependent CR p\u0304 measurements below \u223c3 GeV will be provided by the new\nBESS-Polar instrument scheduled to fly in December of 2007 [21].\nThe diffuse emission is a tracer of interactions of CR particles in the ISM\nand is produced via ICS, bremsstrahlung, and \u03c0 0 -decay. The puzzling excess in\nthe EGRET data above 1 GeV [24] relative to that expected has shown up in all\nmodels that are tuned to be consistent with local nucleon and electron spectra\n[25]. The excess has shown up in all directions, not only in the Galactic plane.\nIf this excess is not an instrumental artefact, it may be telling us that the CR\nintensity fluctuates in space which could be the result of the stochastic nature of\nsupernova events. If this is true, the local CR spectra are not representative of\nthe local Galactic average. Because of the secondary origin of CR antiprotons,\ntheir intensity fluctuates less than that of protons and p\u0304 measurements can be\nused instead to derive the average local intensity of CR protons. Interestingly,\n\n\f44\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\na model based on a renormalized CR proton flux (to fit antiprotons) and a\nCR electron flux (using the diffuse emission itself), the so-called optimized\nmodel, fits the all-sky EGRET data well [25] providing a feasible explanation\nof the GeV excess. The GLAST observations of the diffuse emission will be\nable to resolve this puzzle. On the other hand, accurate measurements of CR\nantiprotons by PAMELA can be used to test the CR fluctuation hypothesis.\n4\n\nCosmic rays in the heliosphere\n\nInterestingly, GLAST will be able to trace the CRs in the heliosphere as well.\nThe ICS of CR electrons off solar photons produces \u03b3-rays with a broad distribution on the sky contributing to a foreground that would otherwise be\nascribed to the Galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission [26]. Observations\nby GLAST can be used to monitor the heliosphere and determine the electron\nspectrum as a function of position from distances as large as Saturn's orbit to\nclose proximity of the Sun, thus enabling unique studies of solar modulation.\nA related process is the production of pion-decay \u03b3-rays in interactions of CR\nnuclei with gas in the solar atmosphere [27]. The albedo \u03b3-rays will be observable by GLAST providing a possibility to study CR cascade development in the\nsolar atmosphere, deep atmospheric layers, and magnetic field(s). The original\nanalysis of the EGRET data assumed that the Sun is a point source and yielded\nonly an upper limit [28]. However, a recent re-analysis of the EGRET data [29]\nhas found evidence of the albedo (pion-decay) and the extended ICS emission.\nThe maximum likelihood values appear to be consistent with the predictions.\nGLAST will also be able to measure CR electrons directly. It is a very\nefficient electron detector able to operate in the range between \u223c20 GeV and 2\nTeV [30]. The total number of detected electrons will be \u223c107 per year. Accurate measurements of the CR electron spectrum are very important for studies\nof CR propagation and diffuse \u03b3-ray emission. There is also the possibility to\nsee the features associated with the local sources of CR electrons.\nThe Moon emits \u03b3-rays [28, 31] due to CR interactions in its rocky surface.\nMonte Carlo simulations of the albedo spectrum using the GEANT4 framework\nshow that it is very steep with an effective cutoff around 3 GeV and exhibits a\nnarrow pion-decay line at 67.5 MeV [32]. The albedo flux below \u223c1 GeV significantly depends on the incident CR proton and helium spectra which change\nover the solar cycle. Therefore, it is possible to monitor the CR spectrum at 1\nAU using the albedo \u03b3-ray flux. Simultaneous measurements of CR proton and\nhelium spectra by PAMELA, and observations of the albedo \u03b3-rays by GLAST,\ncan be used to test the model predictions. Since the Moon albedo spectrum\nis well understood, it can be used as a standard candle for GLAST. Besides,\nthe predicted pion-decay line at 67.5 MeV and the steep spectrum at higher\nenergies present opportunities for in orbit energy calibration of GLAST.\n\n\fIgor V.

PAMELA is a satellite-borne\napparatus designed to study charged particles in the cosmic radiation,\nto investigate the nature of dark matter, measuring the cosmic-ray antiproton and positron spectra over the largest energy range ever achieved,\nand to search for antinuclei with unprecedented sensitivity. In this paper we will present the status of the apparatus after one year in orbit;\nfurthermore, we will discuss the PAMELA cosmic-ray measurements capabilities.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nPAMELA (Payload for Antimatter/Matter Exploration and Light-nuclei Astrophysics) is a satellite-borne experiment which has been designed to study\ncharged cosmic rays, in particular having been optimized to reveal the rare\nantiparticle component of the cosmic radiation. Its principal aim is the measurement of the energy spectra of antiprotons and positrons with high precision\n47\n\n\f48\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nand over a wide range, but also other more common components like protons,\nelectrons and light nuclei will be thoroughly investigated. This will allow to\nlook for evidences of the existence of dark matter, to check the correctness\nof cosmic-ray propagation models and also to test for the possible presence of\nantinuclei by direct detection.\nThe instrument was launched into space on June 15th 2006 from the Baikonur\ncosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The apparatus is installed inside a pressurized\ncontainer attached to the Russian Resurs-DK1 earth observation satellite. The\nsatellite orbit is elliptical and semi-polar, with an altitude varying between 350\nkm and 600 km, at an inclination of 70\u25e6 . The mission is foreseen to last for at\nleast three years.\nIn this paper we will present a status report of the mission after one year\nof flight, and we will show preliminary results about particle identification and\ncosmic ray fluxes measurements.\n2\n\nThe scientific case\n\nThe primary scientific goal of the PAMELA experiment is the study of the antimatter component of the cosmic radiation, in order: 1. to search for antinuclei,\nin particular antihelium; 2. to search for evidence of annihilations of dark matter particles by accurate measurements of the antiproton and positron energy\nspectra; 3. to test cosmic-ray propagation models through precise measurements of the antiproton and positron energy spectra and precision studies of\nlight nuclei and their isotopes.\nConcomitant goals include: 1. a study of solar physics and solar modulation\nduring the 24th solar minimum; 2. a study of trapped particles in the radiation\nbelts. The semipolar orbit allows PAMELA to investigate a wide range of\nenergies for the different antiparticles, particles and nuclei. Three years of\ndata taking will provide unprecedented statistics in these energy ranges with\nno atmospheric overburden, consenting to greatly reduce the systematic errors\nof the balloon measurements, and to explore for the first time the p\u0304 and e+\nenergy spectra well beyond the present limit of experimental data (\u223c40 GeV).\n3\n\nThe PAMELA apparatus\n\nThe core of the PAMELA instrument, as sketched in figure 1, is a permanent\nmagnet spectrometer equipped with a silicon tracker. The tracking system\nconsists of six 300 \u03bcm thick silicon sensors segmented into micro-strips on both\nsides. The mean magnetic field inside the magnet cavity is 0.43 T with a value\nof 0.48 T measured at the centre[1].\nA sampling electromagnetic calorimeter, composed of W absorber plates\nand single-sided, macro strip Si detector planes is mounted below the spec-\n\n\fR.

The detector is\napproximately 1.3 m high, has a mass of 470 kg and an average power consumption of 355W. The magnetic field lines inside the spectrometer cavity are\noriented along the y direction.

A scintillation shower tail catcher and a neutron detector made of\n3\nHe counters enveloped in polyethylene moderator complete the bottom part\nof the apparatus[2].\nA Time-of-Flight (ToF) system, made of three double-layers of plastic scintillator strips, and an anticoincidence system complement the apparatus. Particles trigger the instrument when crossing the ToF scintillator paddles. The\nToF system also measures the absolute value of the particle charge and flight\ntime crossing its planes. In this way downgoing particles can be separated from\nup-going ones[3].\nParticles not cleanly entering the PAMELA acceptance are identified by the\nanticounter system[4]. Then, the rigidities of the particles are determined by\nthe magnetic spectrometer. Thus, positively and negatively charged particles\ncan be identified. The final identification (i.e. positrons, electrons, antiprotons,\n\n\f50\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 2: Sequence of acquisition modes during a typical orbit of PAMELA.\nMode A refers to high-radiation regions and it is typical for polar regions and\nSAA, whilst mode B holds for low radiation regions like the equator. The\ncalibration is done at every ascending node.\netc.) is provided by the combination of the calorimeter and neutron detector[5]\ninformation plus the velocity measurements from the ToF system and ionization\nlosses in the tracker system at low momenta.\nElectrons and protons are distinguished by comparing the particle patterns\nand energy losses inside the calorimeter. Additional hadron-rejection power is\nprovided by the neutron detector and this increases as the energy increases.\nThe detector is approximately 120 cm high, has a mass of about 470 kg and\na power consumption of 355 W. A very detailed description of the PAMELA\ndetector along with an overview of the entire mission can be found in [6].\n4\n\nPAMELA in-flight operations\n\nPAMELA is hosted by the Russian earth-observation satellite Resurs-DK1 that,\nonboard a Soyuz vehicle, was successfully launched in space on June 15th 2006\nfrom the Baikonur (Kazakhstan) cosmodrome.\nThe Resurs-DK1 satellite is manufactured by the Russian space company\nTsSKB Progress to perform multispectral remote sensing of the earth's surface\nand acquire high-quality images in near real-time. The satellite has a mass of\n6.7 tonnes and a height of 7.4 m. During launch and orbital manoeuvres, the\nPC is secured against the body of the satellite. During data-taking it is swung\nup to give PAMELA a clear view into space.\n\n\fR. Sparvoli, V. Malvezzi\n\nCosmic Rays with PAMELA\n\n51\n\nOn June 21st 2006 PAMELA was switched on for the first time. After a few\nweeks of commissioning, during which several trigger and hardware configurations were tested, PAMELA has been in a nearly continuous data taking mode\nsince July 11th . Until June 2007, the total acquisition time has been \u223c 300\ndays, for a total of \u223c610 million collected events and 5.4 TByte of down-linked\nraw data.\nAll in-flight operations are handled by the PSCU (PAMELA Storage and\nControl Unit). The PSCU manages the data acquisition and other physics\ntasks and continuously checks for proper operation of the apparatus. The data\nacquisition is segmented in runs, defined as continuous period of data taking\nwith constant detector and trigger configurations. The duration of a run is\ndetermined by the PSCU according to the orbital position. Two acquisition\nmodes are implemented, for high- (radiation belts and polar regions - MODE\nA) and low- (equatorial region - MODE B) radiation environments. The run\nconfiguration, in both acquisition modes, and the criterion to switch between\nlow- and high-radiation environments can be varied from ground. The main\nPAMELA trigger conditions are defined by coincident energy deposits in the\nscintillator ToF layers. The high-radiation trigger environment uses only information from the S2 and S3 scintillators while the low-radiation one also from\nthe S1 scintillators. Figure 2 shows the PAMELA trigger rate as a function of\norbital position for a typical orbit. The coloured lines define the regions where\nthe different acquisition modes are alternated. From the figure it can been seen\nthat the average trigger rate of the experiment is \u223c 25 Hz, varying from \u223c 20\nHz at the equatorial region to \u223c 30 Hz at the poles. Furthermore also the\nregion where the satellite crosses the inner proton radiation belt, i.e. the South\nAtlantic Anomaly, can be clearly seen as a significant increase in the trigger\nrate. Figure 3 presents instead a map of PAMELA triggers as integrated over\nmany orbits of PAMELA. The colours are proportional to the trigger rate, as\nindicated by the palette. Again the South Atlantic Anomaly is clearly seen.\nThe control of the experiment from ground is performed via two different type of commands: macrocommands, which talk directly to the PAMELA\nPSCU, and telecommands, which are commands sent instead to Resurs-DK1\nhandling main power lines. Hundreds of parameters (current and voltage values, thresholds, switching on and off of parts of the subdetectors, trigger configurations, ...) are modifiable through macrocommands therefore the system\nis extremely flexible so to be able to meet any unknown and unpredictable\nsituation in flight.\nThe average fractional live time of the experiment exceeds 70%. During\nthe entire PAMELA observational time to far some error conditions (approximately one per week) occurred, mainly attributable to anomalous electronics\nconditions in the detector electronics. Every time the PSCU was able to recover\nthe system functionality and continue the acquisition.

Furthermore, no radiation dose effects have been observed in the\nPAMELA sub-detectors. Indeed, all sub-detectors are behaving nominally.\n4.1 Ground-data processing\nThe ground segment of the Resurs-DK1 system is located at the Research\nCenter for Earth Operative Monitoring (NTs OMZ) in Moscow, Russia. The\nreception antenna at NTs OMZ is a parabolic reflector of 7 m diameter (see\nfigure 4, left), equipped with an azimuth elevation rotation mechanism, and has\ntwo frequency multiplexed radio channels. The Resurs-DK1 radio link towards\nNTs OMZ is active between 4 and 6 times a day.\nAbout 14 GB of PAMELA data are transferred to ground every day. The\nPAMELA data processing scheme is shown in figure 4 (right). Data received\nfrom PAMELA are collected by a dataset archive server which provides a secure\nconnection from the Ground Station to the PAMELA Ground Segment. The\ndownlinked data are then transmitted to a server dedicated to data processing for instrument monitoring and control, and are also written onto magnetic\ntapes for long-term storage. A pre-processing software calculates the downlink session quality (the error probability per bit), removes from the files all\ntransport headers and footers and prepares the data for unpacking. At the\n\n\fR. Sparvoli, V. Malvezzi\n\nCosmic Rays with PAMELA\n\n53\n\nFigure 4: Left: main antenna in NTs OMZ. Right: Data processing scheme at\nPAMELA Groung Segment in NTs OMZ.\n\nsame time information about received data files is stored into a MySQL data\nbase; the access to the data base is made through a web interface, thus giving\nthe possibility to the operators to easily check up data and faulty downlink\nsessions. In case of low quality transmission, a given downlink can be assigned\nfor retransmission up to several days after the initial downlink.\nData are then processed by a 1st Level software, a ROOT1 based C++\nprogram. This software unpacks all different structures creating the various\ntrees (event, calibration, housekeeping, orbital information, etc). A quicklook\napplicative software monitors the status of housekeeping and physics data in\norder to allow local and remote (web based) assessment of the status of the\nmission. Short term programming and telecommand/macrocommand issuing\nis based on the result of the quicklook: for instance, in case of Solar Particle\nEvent the number of allocated on-board memory may be increased.\nAfter this level of data analysis, both raw and 1st Level processed data are\nmoved through a normal internet line to the main storage centre in Eastern\nEurope, which is located at MEPHI (Moscow, Russia). From here, the GRID\ninfrastructure is used to move raw data to the main storage and analysis centre\nof the PAMELA Collaboration, located at CNAF (Bologna, Italy), a specialized\ncomputing centre of INFN (Italian National Institute of Nuclear Physics). Here\ndata are accessible to all various institutions within the PAMELA collaboration.\n\n1 http://root.cern.ch\n\n\f54\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 5: The event display a \u223c 41 GV interacting antiproton.

The signal as detected by PAMELA detectors\nare shown along with the particle trajectory (solid line) reconstructed by the\nfitting procedure of the tracking system.\n\n5\n\nParticle selection and preliminary cosmic ray measurements\n\nThe central components of PAMELA are a permanent magnet and a tracking\nsystem composed of six planes of silicon sensors, which form a magnetic spectrometer. This device is used to determine the rigidity R = pc/Ze and the\ncharge of particles crossing the magnetic cavity. The rigidity measurement is\ndone through the reconstruction of the trajectory based on the impact points\non the tracking planes and the resulting determination of the curvature due to\nthe Lorentz force. The direction of bending of the particle (i.e. the discrimination of the charge sign) is the key method used to separate matter from\nantimatter.\n\n\fR. Sparvoli, V. Malvezzi\n\nCosmic Rays with PAMELA\n\n55\n\nFigure 6: The event display a \u223c 70 GV positron.

The signal as detected by PAMELA detectors are\nshown along with the particle trajectory (solid line) reconstructed by the fitting\nprocedure of the tracking system.\nFigures 5 and 6 show respectively \u223c 41 GV negatively-charged interacting\nhadron identified as an antiproton and a a \u223c 70 GV positively-charged electromagnetic particle identified as a positron, crossing PAMELA and triggering\nthe acquisition. The particle path, reconstructed by the tracking system, is\nextrapolated to the other detectors. It is clearly seen that the track is consistent with the energy deposits both in the scintillator ToF system and in the\ncalorimeter. A different signature in the neutron detector - due to the different\nnature (hadronic or leptonic) of the shower produced in the calorimeter - can\nbe clearly noticed. Indeed, additional hadron-rejection power is provided by\nthe neutron detector and this increases as the energy increases.\nProtons and electrons dominate the positively and negatively charged components of the cosmic radiation, respectively. Hence, positrons must be iden-\n\n\f56\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 7: Distribution of the topological variable \"ncore\" as function of the\nrigidity for a sample of events.

To achieve its scientific goals, the PAMELA system must separate\nelectrons from hadrons at a level of 105 \u2013 106 . Much of this separation must be\nprovided by the calorimeter, i.e.: electrons must be selected with an acceptable\nefficiency and with as small a hadron contamination as possible.\nA complex set of variables is used to separate electromagnetic and hadronic\nshowers in the calorimeter. These variables characterize the shower inside the\ncalorimeter taking into account its starting point, its longitudinal and transverse profiles, its topological development and the energy release compared to\nthe one given by the tracking system.\nFigure 7 represents the particle discrimination capabilities using a topological variable as function of the rigidity as measured by the tracking system.\nThis variable takes into account the number of hits along the track till the plane\nof maximum calculated using the momentum of the particle and assuming an\nelectromagnetic shower.

Electron and\npositrons bands can be clearly distinguished from anti\u2013protons and protons\nplus helium bands.\nThe PAMELA instruments is optimized for the detection of positrons and\nantiprotons, nevertheless three different sub-detectors (ToF, tracker and calorimeter) are able to identify light nuclei, with different efficiencies, resolutions and\nZ ranges. Such particle identification, together with the particle momentum\nmeasured by the spectrometer, will allow to reconstruct their energy spectra. Accurate simulations are in progress to evaluate systematic uncertainties\nresulting from the various correction factors needed to evaluate fluxes such as\nuncertainties in the determination of the geometry factor, spallation loss within\nthe instrument, and the tracking efficiency as function of Z.\nThe tracking system can be used to determine the absolute value Z of the\n\n\f58\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 9: The ionization loss in the calorimeter with truncated mean using\nthree points and at least four dE/dx measurements versus rigidity.

Figure 8 shows the Z discrimination capability of the tracking system.\nThe spectrometer can contribute with a good charge resolution at least up\nto Be (when the single-channel saturation of the silicon sensors reduces the\nperformances), and it is also able to perform isotopic discrimination for H and\nHe at low rigidities.\nThe dE/dx measurement on the calorimeter silicon planes can be used to\ndetermine the charge of the incident nuclei too. The charge of the particles can\nbe measured in the calorimeter by considering the energy released in the first\nplane of the detector which is not covered by tungsten plates. In presence of a\nreconstructed track, is possible to localize with precision the hit strips and to\ncollect the charge.\nMore sophisticated methods can be used for nuclei not interacting in the\nfirst calorimeter layers.

Detectors did not suffer any damage due to the launch and the\nexperiment has been continuously taking data since then.

The Time-ofFlight system is one of the key elements for the particle identification:\nits charge discrimination capabilities for light nuclei, determined during a\ntest beam calibration, will be presented and compared with preliminary\nin-flight results.\n\n1\n\nThe PAMELA experiment\n\nPAMELA is a satellite-borne experiment [1] built to detect charged particles\nin cosmic rays with particular attention to antiparticles. On June 15th 2007\nPAMELA has reached the first year in orbit. All the detectors are working\nnominally and analysis is in progress to achieve many scientific goals: principally the search for antimatter in primary radiation, the search for dark matter\nsources but also the measurement of fluxes and ratios of the different components of the cosmic radiation and the study of interactions of the radiation\nitself with Sun and Magnetosphere.\nTo reach all these scopes, PAMELA is composed by several instruments\nperfectly integrated; one of the most important elements is the Time-of-Flight\n61\n\n\f62\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nsystem (ToF). The experimental setup allows us to operate precise momentum\nmeasurements, dE/dx and charge spectrum reconstruction as well as investigation of many other topics. Details about the science of PAMELA, as well as\nthe detector and its general status, will be described in another paper in this\nconference [2].\n2\n\nThe Time-of-Flight system\n\nThe ToF system of PAMELA [3, 4] is composed by 24 paddles; each paddle is\nmade by a plastic scintillator connected to a couple of photomultiplier tubes\n(PMT) by means of plastic light guides. The 24 paddles are arranged in 6\nlayers to build 3 planes (S1, S2 and S3) with x and y view.\nThe ToF electronic system [5] converts the 48 PMT pulses into time-based\nand charge-based measurements.\nThe instrument has to fulfill several scientific goals:\n\u2022 to provide a fast trigger signal to the whole experiment\n\u2022 to measure the time of flight of the passing particles, from which a measurement of \u03b2 can be derived\n\u2022 to reject albedo particles events\n\u2022 to support the magnetic spectrometer in the tracking phase\n\u2022 to reconstruct dE/dx spectrum for light nuclei up to Oxygen.\nIn this paper we will focus our attention on the last point, describing the\nmethod currently used in data analysis to identify light nuclei with the T oF\nsystem.\n3\n\nCharge discrimination with T oF\n\nConsider a charged particle coming from above which hits two paddles of different planes; in this case we get four independent time measurement related to\nthe position of the hit point, the velocity of the passing particle, the flight path\nand some peculiar constants. Combining these relations, and joining together\nall the constant values (depending, for example, on geometry or on intrinsic\ncharacteristics of electronics), we have that the time of flight within the two\nhits is function of only \u03b2, according to:\nTT oF = K1 +\n\nK2\n\u03b2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere K1 and K2 are calibration constants; for flight data they are continuously\nmonitored and recalculated.\n\n\fR.

The energy loss\ninside each counter has to be evaluated in units of minimum ionizing particle\n(mip); to obtain this estimation we have to use informations from the magnetic\nspectrometer to select particles of fixed Z, in particular p and He ions. Working\non this selected sample we have to normalize for the angle of incidence (which\nis to correct for the different width of scintillator passing by the particle) and\ncorrect for the position of the hit point along the paddle (which is to normalize\nfor attenuation of the signal using a double exponential fit).At this point we\ncan plot mips versus \u03b2 and select a sample of only nuclei above Helium with\na graphical cut. In addiction, we have to eliminate those events for which the\nelectronics saturates.

Annihilation of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP),\npredicted in many extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics,\nmay give rise to a signal in gamma-ray spectra from many cosmic sources.\nIn this contribution we give an overview of the searches for WIMP Dark\nMatter performed by the GLAST-LAT collaboration, in particular we\ndiscuss the sensitivity of GLAST to thermal WIMP dark matter in the\ngalactic center and to high energy (50 -150 GeV) gamma-ray lines resulting from WIMP pair annihilation into two gamma-rays.\n\n1\n\nLAT searches for Dark Matter\n\nThe Gamma ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) [1] [2] [3] is due for\nlaunch in early 2008. With its large effective area, excellent energy and angular resolution in an energy range of 20 MeV to 300 GeV, the Large Area\n67\n\n\f68\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nTelescope (LAT) on board of GLAST is an ideal detector to search for high\nenergy gamma emission from the annihilation of pairs of Weakly Interacting\nMassive Particles (WIMP) in the universe.\nThe GLAST-LAT collaboration pursues complementary searches for Dark Matter each presenting its own challenges and advantages. In table 1 we summarize\nthe most important ones.\nThe center of our own galaxy is a formidable astrophysical target to search\nfor a Dark Matter signal, the reason being that simulations of Dark Matter\nhalos predict high densities at the center of the galaxy and since the WIMP\nannihilation rate is proportional to the density squared, significant fluxes can\nbe expected. On the other hand, establishing a signal requires identification\nof the high energy gamma-ray sources which are in (or near) the center [6]\nand also an adequate modeling of the galactic diffuse emission due to cosmic\nrays colliding with the interstellar medium. The latter is even more crucial for\nestablishing a WIMP annihilation signal from the galactic halo.\nDue to the 2\u03b3 production channel, a feature in the spectrum from the various\nastrophysical sources would be the gamma-ray line placed at the WIMP mass.\nThis is a \"golden\" signal, in the sense that it would be difficult to explain by an\nastrophysical process different from WIMP annihilation. Also it would be free\nof astrophysical uncertainties, since the background can be determined from\nthe data itself. However, since the 2\u03b3 channel is loop-suppressed, the number\nof photons will be very low.\nIn the following sub-sections, the above mentioned searches will be described in\nmore detail. The sensitivity calculations presented here are work in progress,\nthe reader is referred to a shortly forthcoming paper [4] for updated results.\n2\n\nSensitivity to signal from the Galactic Center\n\nThe \u03b3-ray flux for a generic WIMP, \u03c7, at a given photon energy E is given by\nZ\n\u0001\n\u03c3v X dN\u03b3,f X\n1 \u03c1(l)2\n\u03c6\u03c7 (E) =\n+\nb\u03b3g n\u03b3 \u03b4 E \u2212 m\u03c7 (1 \u2212 m2Z /4m2\u03c7 )\nbf\ndl\n4\u03c0\ndE\n2 m2\u03c7\nl.o.s\ng\nf\n\n(1)\nThis flux depends on the WIMP mass m\u03c7 , the total annihilation cross section\ntimes WIMP velocity \u03c3v and the sum of all the photon yields dN\u03b3,f /dE per\nannihilation channel weighted by the corresponding branching ratio bf . In addition, there is the \"line\" yield due to annihilation into 2 photons or a photon\nand a Z boson. The fragmentation and/or the decay of the tree-level annihilation states gives rise to photons, predominantly via the generation of neutral\n\n\fJ.

The simulation of the photon yield is performed\nwith Pythia 6.202 [8] implemented in the DarkSUSY package [9]. Apart from\nthe annihilation cross-section and photon yields, the WIMP annihilation flux\nalso depends on the WIMP density in the galactic halo, \u03c1(l),integrated along\nthe line of sight. For the results presented here, we assume a Navarro-FranckWhite (NFW) profile [10]. The GLAST detector response has been simulated\nusing the fast simulation program ObsSim, developed by the GLAST LAT collaboration [11].\nFixing the halo density profile, a dominant annihilation channel and the corresponding yield, we perform a scan in the (mwimp , \u03c3v) plane in order to\ndetermine the GLAST reach. The EGRET source given in [6] is also simulated at the Galactic Center and we perform a standard \u03c72 statistical analysis\nto check for each WIMP model compatibility with EGRET data at the 5\u03c3\nlevel. For models consistent with EGRET, we calculate a second \u03c72 to check if\nGLAST is able to disentangle the WIMP contribution from the galactic diffuse\ngamma-ray emission, which is modeled using the GALPROP package [15]. In\nparticular, we consider two different models: the conventional model [16] and\nthe \"optimized\" model [17]. With respect to the former the EGRET measurement of gamma-ray diffuse emission [18] reveals an excess in the multi-GeV\n\n\f70\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nenergy range. The latter has been adjusted to explain the excess in the framework of conventional physics, such as cosmic-ray intensity fluctuations. The\n\"optimized\" model is thus more conservative since it assumes that the GeV\nexcess is not made by Dark Matter whereas the \"conventional\" model allows\nfor a Dark Matter explanation. Figure 1 shows the results of the scans for\nannihilation into bb\u0304 only.\n3\n\nGLAST senstivity to \u03b3-ray lines\n\nIn some dark matter halo models, an annulus around the galactic center could\ngive a signal to noise ratio as much as 12 times greater than at the galactic\ncenter [19]. To estimate the line sensitivity we therefore consider an galactic\ncentered annulus with inner radius of 25 degrees and outer radius of 35 degrees,\nexcluding the region within 10 degrees from the galactic plane to estimate the\nphoton background for WIMP annihilation into narrow lines. LAT line energy\nsensitivities were calculated at 5\u03c3 significance for the case when the line energy\nis known (e.g. supplied by discovery at the Large Hadron Collider) and for\nunknown line energy including a trial factor. We use ObsSim to generate\nLAT resolved annihilation lines. ObsSim was run for 55 days (uniform all-sky\ncoverage for the LAT in scanning mode) with a narrow (\u03c3(E)/E0 = 10\u22123 )\nGaussian energy distribution centered on 25, 50, 75, 100, 125 and 150 GeV. A\n5 year all-sky diffuse background was generated using the previously mentioned\noptimized model for the galactic diffuse background radiation. The region of\ninterest, the galactic annulus excluding the area closest to the galactic plane,\nwas fit with an exponential background in the energy range between 40 and 200\nGeV. For each line the input background was bootstrapped with a Monte Carlo\nsignal 1000 times and fit to an exponential plus a double Gaussian (giving a\ngood fit to the line) as well as an exponential only to calculate a \u2206\u03c72 between\nthe best fit background only and the best fit signal plus background hypotheses.\nThis series of 1000 bootstraps was rerun varying only the average number of\nMC signal counts until average \u2206\u03c72 is larger than 25 (corresponding to a 5\u03c3\ndetection). The average number of signal counts needed at each energy was\nthen converted to a sensitivity using average exposures integrated over the\nannulus. A bin width of FWHM/E = 8% was used based on the FWHM\nenergy resolution of the GLAST-LAT. The flux needed for a 5\u03c3 detection is\nshown in figure 2. Assuming a dark matter density and a gamma-ray yield,\nsensitivity as function of velocity averaged cross-section can be obtained. The\nresults presented here should be considered preliminary that current refinement\nof the used instrument response parameterizations is ongoing. This will, among\nother things allow us to study line sensitivity in the whole specified energy range\n(upto 300 GeV). Also, low number of counts will require more refined statistical\nmethods, which are currently under study, see for example [20].\n\n\fJ. Conrad\n\nGLAST-LAT Dark Matter searches\n\n71\n\nFigure 1: Cross Section times WIMP velocity versus the WIMP mass for the\nbb\u0304 annihilation channel. The red region might be excluded by the EGRET\ndata around the galactic center. It should however be noted that there is\nconsiderable controversy as to if the EGRET data above 1 GeV are reliable,\nsee e.g. [12], [13][14]. Models in blue region are not detectable by GLAST and\ngreen region correspond to models detectable by GLAST for both conventional\nand optimized astrophysical background. The background uncertainties are\nreflected in the yellow regions as for these models, only one of the astrophysical\nbackground allows a detection by GLAST.\n\n\f72\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 2: 5\u03c3 line flux sensitivity achievable within 5 years GLAST-LAT operation as function of energy (WIMP mass).

Several complementary astrophysical sources will be examined, each presenting its own advantages and challenges.\nThose discussed in this note regard the WIMP annihilation signal from galactic center and the golden signal for presence of particle dark matter, namely\ngamma-ray lines from direct annihilation of WIMPS. For the galactic center,\ncosmologically interesting regions of the parameter space (\u03c3v \u223c 10\u221226 ) are\nwithin the reach. Line flux sensitivity for an annulus around the galactic center are presented. These can be converted into a sensitivity for annihilation\ncross-section assuming a dark matter distribution. GLAST is now integrated\non the space-craft and undergoing final testing. The launch is foreseen for early\n2008.\n5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe author would like to thank all members of the GLAST working group for\nDark Matter and New Physics which contributed to this note.

Each tower is composed by a tracker module, consisting of\na vertical stack of 18 x-y single-sided silicon strip detectors tracking planes\ninterleaved with tungsten foil converters, a calorimeter module composed by\n96 CsI(Tl) crystals, with a total depth of 8.6 radiation lengths, and a data\nacquisition module (DAQ) [1].\n\n2\n\nObservatory data taking and muon data analysis\n\nThe verification strategy of the Science Requirements for the LAT consists of a\ncombination of simulations, beam tests [2], and cosmic ray induced ground-level\nmuon tests [3]. Ground-level muon data allow to test and validate the Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulation of the instrument response. Data taking with cosmic\nray muons was performed at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in\n2005-2006 during the phase of Integration and Test (I&T) of the LAT [3]. Similar tests have been also performed starting from March 2007, with the two\nGLAST instruments completely integrated onto the spacecraft (Observatory)\nat \"General Dynamics (GD) Advanced Information System\" in Gilbert, Arizona.\n\nFigure 1: Geometrical selection criteria\n\n\fC.

We required that the particles crossed the\nwhole LAT (track (a) in figure 1) or a single tower (track (b) figure 1) from the\nTKR top layer to the CAL bottom layer and that the energy deposition in the\nCAL layers was consistent with that of a minimum ionizing particle.\n2.2 Monitoring of the TKR performance\nWe monitored the TKR performance analyzing both I&T and observatory data\nand comparing them with a Monte Carlo simulation developed for the detector\nin the I&T configuration. In figure 2 the distributions of the TKR hits (fired\nstrips) and clusters (groups of adjacent fired strips) for single tower events are\nshown. The cluster distributions of cosmic ray data (both I&T and observatory)\nare in agreement with MC predictions, while the hit distributions are slightly\ndifferent for the three samples. The discrepancies between I&T and observatory\ndata are due to different settings of the DAQ: observatory data have been taken\nwith the hardware in flight configuration, while I&T data were taken with the\nhardware configured for ground analysis [3]. For what concerns the differences\nbetween data (both observatory and I&T) and simulations, it is worth to point\nout that electronics simulation is still being developed and ground-level muon\ndata can provide good inputs to improve the Monte Carlo codes.\nIn figure 3, the dependence of the total number of hit strips in the TKR on\nthe zenith angle \u03b8 is shown for samples of muons crossing the whole LAT (like\ntrack (a) in figure 1). As expected, the total number of hits increases linearly\n\nFigure 2: TKR cluster (left) and hit (right) distributions for single tower events.\n\n\f78\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nwith sec \u03b8, i.e. it is proportional to the track length.\n\nFigure 3: Total number of hit strips in the TKR vs sec \u03b8.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe LAT performance have continuosly been monitored during the phase of the\ninstrument integration and the monitoring will continue during the pre-launch\nphase up to the launch date (actually scheduled for January 31, 2008).

In addition, at least for\ntraditional sources like the galactic center, one often has to face a considerable astro-physical background. This points more and more towards\nan unavoidable need for clear spectral signatures that could unambiguously identify a potential dark matter annihilation signal. After stressing\nthat gamma rays are particularly promising in this respect, I give an updated overview over possible point-sources of dark matter annihilations\nand the prospects for current and future experiments to detect them.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile there has accumulated overwhelming evidence that non-baryonic, cold\ndark matter (DM) provides the building block of the observed structures in the\nuniverse, comparably little is known about its detailed properties. Shedding\nlight on the nature of the DM thus remains a major challenge for cosmology\nand (astro-)particle physics. A theoretically particularly well-motivated class\nof DM candidates, however, are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs)\n[1]. They arise in almost all extensions to the standard model of particle\nphysics (SM) as the lightest of a set of new, massive particles and are stable\ndue to some internal symmetry; thermally produced in the early universe, they\n79\n\n\f80\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nautomatically acquire a relic density consistent with the needed amount of DM.\nTypically, the WIMP mass falls into the range 50 GeV . m\u03c7 . 10 TeV.\nA possible way for the indirect detection of DM makes use of the fact that\nWIMPs usually can pair-annihilate into SM particles and thereby potentially\nleave an imprint in cosmic rays of various kinds. The great advantage of gamma\nrays \u2013 as compared to other cosmic ray species \u2013 is that to them the galactic\nhalo looks almost entirely transparent; gamma rays thus point directly to their\nsources and no further assumptions have to be made about their propagation\nlike in the case of charged particles. The same is in principle true also for\nneutrinos; from an observational point of view, however, they are less interesting since the sensitivities for their detection are significantly below those\nfor gamma-rays (this situation only changes for very nearby sources like the\ncenter of the earth or the sun). On the experimental side, this theoretical\ninterest is met by a new generation of space- (AGILE and GLAST [2]) and\nground-based (ARGO, CANGAROO, HESS, MAGIC, MILAGRO, VERITAS\n[3]) experiments with impressive performances that will allow to put non-trivial\nlimits on the relevant parameter space of popular WIMP candidates. Upcoming and planned experiments like AMS-02, CTA, GAW [4] will show further\nsignificant improvements with respect to both the gamma-ray sensitivity and\nthe range of observable energies.\nThe expected gamma-ray flux (in units of GeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 ) from a\nsource with DM density \u03c1 is given by\nZ\nZ\ndN\u03b3f\nh\u03c3viann X\n1\nd\u03a9\nd\u03a6\u03b3\n(E\u03b3 , \u2206\u03c8) =\n\u00d7\nB\ndl(\u03c8)\u03c12 (r) .\nf\ndE\u03b3\n4\u03c0m2\u03c7\ndE\u03b3\n2 \u2206\u03c8 \u2206\u03c8 l.o.s\n\n(1)\n\nf\n\nHere, h\u03c3viann is the total annihilation cross section, Bf the branching ratio\ninto channel f and N\u03b3f the number of resulting photons. The right part of the\nabove expression essentially counts the number of DM particle pairs (times m2\u03c7 )\nalong the line of sight of a detector with an opening angle \u2206\u03c8. Since it depends\nstrongly on the largely unknown distribution of DM, it results in a considerable\nuncertainty in the overall normalization of the expected annihilation flux. The\nfirst part of the above expression for the flux, on the other hand, depends only\non the underlying particle physics model and can be determined to a much\nbetter accuracy. It is here that the energy dependence of the signal enters,\nillustrating the need for clear spectral signatures in order to eventually be able\nto discriminate DM from more conventional astrophysical sources.\nThis first part of Eq. (1) is discussed in more detail in Section 2. In Section\n3, an overview over the most promising point-sources of DM annihilations is\ngiven, before turning in Section 4 to detection prospects for current and planned\nexperiments. Section 5, finally, concludes.\n\n\fTorsten Bringmann\n\n2\n\nDark matter point-sources\n\n81\n\nDark matter annihilation spectra\n\nEven though DM does not directly couple to photons, annihilating DM particles\ncan give rise to gamma-rays in various ways . Principally, one can distinguish\nbetween three different kinds of contributions to the total annihilation signal:\n\u2022 secondary photons\n\u2022 line signals\n\u2022 final state radiation (FSR)\nSecondary photons arise from the fragmentation and further decay of other annihilation products, mainly through the decay of neutral pions, i.e. \u03c0 0 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3.\nThe resulting photon distribution can be obtained from Monte Carlo packages\nlike Pythia [5]. Except for the case of \u03c4 lepton final states, which are usually sub-dominant and thus of less practical importance, these spectra are very\nsimilar and show an E\u03b3\u22121.5 behaviour, up to an exponential cutoff at m\u03c7 that\nappears due to kinematic reasons. In fact, taking into account that neither\nthe absolute amplitude nor m\u03c7 are a priori known, these spectra are almost\nindistinguishable (see, e.g., [6]). Secondary photons usually dominate the total\nannihilation spectrum at low and intermediate energies, i.e. E\u03b3 . 0.5 m\u03c7 . Unless the cutoff can be clearly observed with good statistics, it is quite difficult to\ndistinguish these rather featureless spectra from typical astrophysical sources,\nwhich very often also show a power law-like behaviour.\nSharp line signals result from two-body final states where at least one of\nthe particles is a photon; possible annihilation products are thus \u03b3\u03b3, Z\u03b3 or\nH\u03b3. While the observation of such a line feature at E\u03b3 = m\u03c7 (or E\u03b3 =\nm\u03c7 [1 \u2212 m2\u03c7 /(4m2Z,H )], respectively), with a typical width O(10\u22123 ) due to the\nWIMP velocity in the galactic halo, would be a smoking-gun signature for DM\nannihilations, these processes are necessarily loop-suppressed and thus generically give rise to rather low fluxes. However, there exist WIMP examples where\nsuch line signals may be detectable even for current detector performances [7],\nespecially when powerful enhancement mechanisms due to non-perturbative\neffects are at work [8]. In contrast to secondary photons, the corresponding\nannihilation rates are highly model-dependent and could thus in principle provide valuable information about the nature of the annihilating DM particles,\nespecially when more than just one line is observed.\nWhenever DM annihilates into pairs of charged SM particles (which is a\ngeneric situation for WIMPs), the same process with an additional photon\nin the final state unavoidably also takes place. If the produced charged SM\nparticles are much lighter than the annihilating DM particles, this final state\nradiation (FSR) actually dominates the total gamma-ray spectrum at high\nenergies, E\u03b3 & 0.5 m\u03c7 [9]. Prominent examples include the supersymmetric\n\n\f82\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nneutralino when it is a pure Higgsino or Wino [10], Kaluza-Klein DM in theories\nwith universal extra dimensions [11], or scalar DM [12]; in fact, FSR turns\nout to be important even for more general neutralino compositions [13]. An\nimportant feature of FSR photons is furthermore that they provide much more\npronounced spectral signatures than secondary photons. This could not only\nhelp to unambiguously identify the DM origin of an observed signal, but also\nto actually distinguish between different DM candidates and thus to provide\nimportant information about the underlying nature of the annihilating DM\nparticles (see, e.g., [14] for an illustrative example).\n3\n\nPoint source candidates\n\nFor sources of DM annihilation with an angular extent smaller than the resolution of the detector, the line-of-sight integral in expression (1) takes the\nfollowing form:\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\u22121\nd\u03a9\n2\n2\ndl(\u03c8)\u03c1 (r) \u2243 D \u2206\u03c8\nd3 r\u03c12 (r) ,\n(2)\n\u2206\u03c8 \u2206\u03c8 l.o.s\n\nwhere D is the distance to the point-source. Obviously, promising point-sources\nof DM annihilations should thus i) be as close as possible, ii) exhibit high DM\nconcentrations and iii) lie in directions where a small contamination from astrophysical backgrounds is expected. Possible DM gamma-ray point-sources that\nhave been discussed include:\n\u2022 The galactic center\n\u2022 Milky Way satellites (dwarf spheroidals) and external galaxies\n\u2022 intermediate mass black holes\n\u2022 DM substructures (\"clumps\") in the MW halo\nThe galactic center (GC) has traditionally been regarded as the most promising source of gamma rays. Unfortunately, the observed spectrum from that\ndirection \u2013 well fitted by a E\u03b3\u22122.2 power law and most likely of astro-physical\nrather than DM origin [15] \u2013 provides a major challenge to detect any DM\nsignature on top of the background flux [16]. While still challenging, however,\nthis situation improves when including the effect of FSR photons [17]. Note,\nfurther, that there is more room for a DM induced gamma-ray flux at energies\nbetween the EGRET (. 30 GeV) and HESS (& 100 GeV) observations; this\nwindow will be closed by GLAST. In any case, it is intriguing to realize that\nDM annihilations can give rise to gamma-ray fluxes of the same strength as\nthe actually observed one, for reasonably optimistic assumptions about the DM\ndistribution near the GC (see, e.g., [11]).\n\n\fTorsten Bringmann\n\nDark matter point-sources\n\n83\n\nDwarf spheroidals (dSphs) that are satellites to the Milky Way (MW) are\nalso very interesting potential targets for indirect DM searches. Since they are\nDM dominated, the expected background from more conventional astrophysical\nsources is expected to be rather low; at the same time, they are still in he\ngalactic neighborhood. As a rule of thumb, the expected photon flux from these\nsources is at the per-cent level as compared to that from the GC (under similar\nastrophysical assumptions); for a recent analysis see, e.g., [18]. Extra-galactic\nobjects that have been proposed as possible DM induced gamma-ray sources\ninclude Andromeda (M31), the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Coma Cluster.\nTaking into account the considerable astro-physical uncertainties about the DM\ndistribution, detectional prospects are not not too different from the case of\nMW dSphs.\nAs realized in [19], a population of intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in\nthe galactic halo could be bright sources of gamma rays from DM annihilations.\nIn fact, for typical WIMP masses of m\u03c7 = 150 GeV, GLAST is expected to see\n\u223c 15 of them - while for TeV-scale DM particles, at most a handful should be\nvisible [6].\nNumerical N -body simulations predict that a large fraction of DM is not\ndistributed homogeneously but in the form of substructures, or clumps, down\nto the free-streaming scale for WIMPs [20] as determined by the scale of their\nkinetic decoupling in the early universe [21]. While this certainly has the effect\nof boosting any annihilation signal with respect to a smooth DM distribution,\nit is unlikely that the smallest structures can be resolved separately [22]. If,\nhowever, by chance, one of the larger clumps would be sufficiently nearby and\nthus detectable by GLAST, this could be a unique chance to study in detail\nthe observed annihilation signal.\n4\n\nExperimental prospects\n\nGamma-ray observations can be performed both in space and on earth. The\nsensitivity of space-based telescopes is bounded by rather small effective areas\nand there is usually an upper bound on the photon energy that can be resolved\n(\u223c 300 GeV for GLAST, \u223c 1 TeV for AMS-02); a big advantage that allows\nthe discovery of previously unknown sources, on the other hand, is typically\na great field of view. Earth-based telescopes are complementary in that they\nhave to face a lower bound on the observable energy since, below \u223c 30 GeV, no\nelectromagnetic showers are produced in the atmosphere; due to an effective\narea of several km2 they can, however, achieve much better sensitivities than\nspace-based telescopes. Their rather small field of view makes them ideal for\npointed observations.\nFor potential DM sources with known locations (GC, dSphs, external galaxies), one would thus use earth-based telescopes (note that their energy threshold\n\n\f84\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nroughly coincides with the lower range of masses for typical WIMP candidates),\nwhile for objects like IMBHs or DM clumps, which have no known counterpart\nin other wavelengths, one needs space-based experiments to locate them; once\ndetected, they could be studied more thoroughly with ground-based telescopes,\nhoping, in particular, to see some of the pronounced spectral signatures discussed in Section 2.\nA nice overview over the point-source sensitivities for various existing and\nplanned gamma-ray experiments can be found in Ref. [23] (the planned CTA,\nstill missing in that comparison, is expected to reach sensitivities about one\norder of magnitude better than the HESS telescope). For the upcoming GLAST\nsatellite, whole-sky sensitivity maps are also available \u2013 both for the detection\nof point-sources and for the discrimination of a DM from an astrophysical\nsource [6]. Translating these sensitivities into the needs for the potential sources\ndiscussed in the last section, and making reasonably optimistic assumptions\nabout the local DM distributions, one finds that already operating or shortly\nupcoming experiments start to probe the parameter space of standard WIMP\ncandidates for all of these cases (with the possible exception of micro-halos).\nFor very pessimistic astrophysical assumptions (cores instead of steep central\nDM profiles, only small amplification effects from substructure, no baryonic\ncompression in the GC, etc.), however, not even the projected sensitivity of\nlarge-scale experiments like the CTA is sufficient to see a signal from any of\nthe sources discussed above.\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nA new generation of experiments is about to probe the high-energy gamma-ray\nsky with an accuracy that could make the indirect detection of DM feasible in\nthe foreseeable or even near future. Despite these exciting prospects, however,\none should keep in mind that they rely on optimistic (though not overly optimistic!) astrophysical assumptions; in the worst case scenarios, with the most\npessimistic DM profiles consistent with simulations and actual observations,\nnone of the standard DM candidates may give rise to visible gamma-ray fluxes.\nGiven the great astrophysical uncertainties, an obvious strategy consists of\nreducing them by both higher-resolution simulations and improved observations\n(taking, e.g., into account more stars in order to determine the gravitational\npotential to a better accuracy). On the other hand, one will most likely always be left with a considerable uncertainty in the absolute strength of DM\nannihilation signals; it is therefore of great importance to focus on distinctive\nspectral signatures that can clearly be attributed to a DM origin \u2013 such as the\ndiscussed line signals or FSR spectra.\nFinally, let us stress that such a strategy will be even more successful if\ncomplemented with the search for indirect DM signals both at other frequencies\n\n\fTorsten Bringmann\n\nDark matter point-sources\n\n85\n\nand in other cosmic ray species. Such a complementary approach, including\nalso bounds from direct DM searches as well as collider data from the LHC in\nthe near future, seems to be the most promising way to finally reveal non-trivial\ninformation about the nature of the DM.\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this very nice \u2013 yet\nmaybe a bit too tightly packed \u2013 workshop with its pleasant atmosphere at\nVilla Mondragone.\nReferences\n[1] For a recent review, see G.

This is because any determination\nwill depend on accurate subtraction of the galactic diffuse and celestial\nforegrounds, as well as point sources. However, the EGBR is likely to\ncontain very rich information about the high energy-gamma ray sources\nof the Universe at cosmological distances.\nWe focus on the ability of GLAST to detect a signal from dark matter in\nthe EGBR. We present sensitivities for generic thermal WIMPs and the\nInert Higgs Doublet Model. Also we discuss the various aspects of astrophysics and particle physics that determines the shape and strength of\nthe signal, such as dark matter halo properties and different dark matter\ncandidates. Other possible sources to the EGBR are also discussed, such\nas unresolved AGNs, and viewed as backgrounds.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nature of dark matter (DM) is still one of the most challenging mysteries\nin present day cosmology and is so far completely unknown. The upcoming\nGamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) [2] will survey a previous\n87\n\n\f88\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nunexplored window to the high energy \u03b3-ray universe, playing a crucial role\nin the indirect detection of weakly interactive massive particle (WIMP) DM\nthrough their self annihilation products, resulting in photons. GLAST will\npursue different searches for DM, including point source surveys, such as the\ngalactic center, and diffuse emission studies [3] .\nIn this paper we focus on the diffuse signal from cosmological, extragalactic\nWIMPs and prospects for GLAST to detect such a signal. We do this for a typical, thermal WIMP and a specific particle physics scenario with an extended\nHiggs sector.\nAlso we examine a recent claim that the EGBR is compatible with a 60\nGeV cosmological WIMP [4] but where we suspect that the effect of cosmology\nhas not been taken into account in the calculations.\nAny sensitivity calculation is dependent on the background of the signal and\nwe present an estimate of possible astrophysical contributions to the EGBR.\n1.1 DM candidates\nThere exists many extensions of the standard model of particle physics that\ncontain suitable WIMP DM candidates. Usually these are neutral, stable particles with masses and interaction strengths that give the observed, present day\nrelic abundance. Probably the most studied of such particles is the neutralino,\nthe lightest neutral particle that arises in supersymmetric extensions of the\nstandard model (see, e.g., [5]) and is often used as the archetype for fermionic\nDM . The mass range of the neutralino is usually from around 50 GeV to a few\nTeV.\nThe lightest Kaluza Klein excitation (often the first excitation of the hyper\ncharge gauge boson) gives an archetype for vector bosonic DM with mass in\nthe range of about 0.5 TeV to a few TeV, see for example [16] and references\ntherein. Below we shall also discuss an archetype for scalar DM.\nThe Inert Doublet Model (IDM) [12] is a minimal extension of the standard model \u2013 an added second Higgs doublet H2 , with an imposed unbroken\ndiscrete Z2 symmetry that forbids its direct coupling to fermions (i.e. H2 is\ninert ). In the IDM the mass of the particle that plays the role of the standard\nmodel Higgs can be as high as about 500 GeV and still fulfill present experimental precision tests. Furthermore, conservation of the Z2 parity implies that\nthe lightest inert Higgs particle (H 0 ) is stable and hence a good DM candidate.\nOne of the interesting features of the IDM is that it offers very high annihilation branching ratios into \u03b3\u03b3 and Z\u03b3 final states, compared to the branching\nratios into quarks, yielding the continuum spectra [13]. The range of WIMP\nmasses is just in the range where GLAST will be sensitive. A spectrum from\na cosmological IDM WIMP can be seen in figure 1.\n\n\fA. Sellerholm, J. Conrad, L. Bergstr\u0308om, J.

Here we follow the procedure of\n[6], where the number of photons per unit effective area, time and solid angle\nin the redshifted energy range E0 to E0 + dE0 , is given by:\nZ\n\u03c3v c \u03c1\u030420\n\u22062 (z) dN\u03b3 (E0 (1 + z)) \u2212\u03c4 (z,E0 )\nd\u03c6\n=\ne\n.\n(1)\ndz (1 + z)3\n2\ndE0\n8\u03c0 H0 M\u03c7\nh(z)\ndE\nIn the following we will discuss the various quantities contributing to eq. (1).\n2.1 High energy \u03b3-ray environment\nAny extragalactic \u03b3-ray signal is strongly affected by absorption in the intergalactic medium, especially at high energies. The absorption is parameterized\nby the parameter \u03c4 , the optical depth. The dominant contribution to the\nabsorption in the GeV-TeV energy range is pair production on the extragalactic\nbackground light emitted in the optical and infrared range. For the optical\ndepth, as function of both redshift and observed energy, we use the results\n\n\f90\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nof [7]. Newer calculations of optical depth are now available, see [8]. These\nresults imply a slightly lower optical depth at low redshifts and slightly higher\nat high redshifts, which in turn slightly enhances or suppresses the WIMP\nsignal, respectively.\n2.2 Particle physics\nThe preferred particle physics model enters the differential gamma-ray flux via\nthe cross section, \u03c3, the WIMP mass M\u03c7 and the differential gamma-ray yield\nper annihilation dN/dE, which is of the form:\ndN\u03b3\ndNcont\n=\n(E) + 2b\u03b3\u03b3 \u03b4(E \u2212 M\u03c7 ) + bZ\u03b3 \u03b4(E \u2212 MZ2 /4M\u03c7 ))\ndE\ndE\n\n(2)\n\nThe first term in eq. (2) is the contribution from WIMP annihilation into the\nfull set of tree-level final states, containing fermions gauge or Higgs bosons,\nwhose fragmentation/decay chain generates photons. These processes give rise\nto a continuous energy spectrum. The second and third terms correspond to\ndirect annihilation into final states of two photons and of one photon and one\nZ boson, respectively. Although of second order (one loop processes), these\nterms can give rise to significant amounts of monochromatic photons.\nSince the emission spectrum of the continuum and line signal are very different in shape, the result of the integration over redshift, in eq. (1), is quite\ndifferent. The continuum spectra becomes slightly broadened and the peak\nis red shifted to lower energies. As a rule of thumb one can keep in mind\nthat the total energy emitted (E 2 d\u03c6/dE), as a function of energy, peaks at\nabout E = M\u03c7 /20 for the intrinsic emission continuum spectrum and about\nE = M\u03c7 /40 for the cosmological spectrum. In figure 1, a comparison between\ncosmological and emission spectra can be seen.\nThe line signal is different since all photons are emitted at the same energy,\nE = M\u03c7 (in the case of a 2\u03b3-final state) and are observed at the energy E0 =\nE(1 + z)\u22121 , depending on at which redshift the WIMPs annihilated. At high\nredshifts the universe becomes opaque to high energy photons and the signal\ngoes down dramatically at lower E0 . This results in the characteristic spectral\nfeature of a sharp cut-off at the WIMP mass, with a tail to lower energies as\nseen in figure 1.\nThe left panel of figure 1 shows a comparison of the photon spectra at\nemission and the cosmological spectra from a 60 GeV WIMP only taken into\naccount annihilation into bb\u0304. The crosses are the reanalyzed EGBR of EGRET\nby [4], where a 60 GeV WIMP has been included in the galactic foreground\nemission model. Without doing any analysis we note that, in contrasts to\nclaims made in [4], the cosmological spectra, from a 60 GeV WIMP, does not\npeak at the characteristic 3 GeV bump in the EGBR measurement, where the\nobserved emission spectrum peaks.\n\n\fA. Sellerholm, J. Conrad, L. Bergstr\u0308om, J. Edsj\u00f6\n\nEGBR and Dark Matter\n\n91\n\n2.3 Halos\nThe question of how dark matter is distributed on small, galactic and subgalactic scale is still a matter of debate. However, N-body simulations show\nthat large structures form by the successive merging of small substructures,\nwith smaller objects usually being denser [9]. The density distribution in DM\nhalos, from simulations, are well fitted by simple analytical forms, where the\nmost common one is the NFW profile, [10].\nSince the annihilation rate is proportional to the dark matter density squared,\nany structure in the DM distribution will significantly boost the annihilation\nsignal from cosmological WIMPs. To take this effect into account we again follow the calculations in [6]. The quantity \u22062 (z) in eq. 1 describes the averaged\nsquared over-density in halos, as a function of redshift.\nClumping the DM into halos typically yields a boost of 104 < \u22062 (z = 0) <\n6\n10 depending on the choice of halo profile and the model of halo concentration\nparameter dependence of redshift and halo mass, where we use results from\n[11]. This freedom of choices introduces about a factor of ten each to the\nuncertainty in the normalization of the cosmological WIMP signal. However,\nthis can be compared to the uncertainty in the signal from point sources, where\nonly the choice of density profile can change the normalization by several orders\nof magnitude, which is the case with WIMP signals from the galactic center.\nAnother difference, compared to point sources, is that the astrophysics of the\nhalo concentration parameter can change the shape of the \u03b3-ray spectrum,\nwhich is solely determined by particle physics in the case of point sources.\nThe largest contribution to \u22062 (z) comes from small halos formed in an\nearlier, denser universe. However, our understanding of halos at the low mass\nend is limited due to finite resolution of the N-body simulation. Therefore we\nhave to use a cut-off mass, below which we do not trust our toymodels for\nthe halo concentration parameters. We put this cut-off at 105 M\u2299 . Lowering\nthe cut-off might boost the signal even further but will also introduce further\nuncertainties.\nAlso within larger halos, N-body simulations indicates that there should\nexist smaller, bound halos that have survived tidal stripping. These halos\nare indicated to have masses all the way down to 10\u22126 M\u2299 . Although not\nas massive as the primary halos the substructure halos arise in higher density\nenvironments which makes them denser than their parent halo. The phenomena\nof halos within halos seems to be a generic feature since detailed simulations\nreveals substructures even within sub halos [9].\n3\n\nAstrophysical contributions to the EGBR\n\nThe \"standard\" model for explaining the EGRB is that it consists of diffuse\nemission from unresolved, \u03b3-ray point sources such as blazars, quasars, star-\n\n\f92\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 2: GLAST 1-year, 5\u03c3 sensitivity for generic, thermal WIMPs annihilation into bb\u0304 and a branching of 10\u22123 into two-photon lines.

The dashed line is the 1 year GLAST\n5\u03c3 line sensitivity with a NFW profile and the dot dashed line the sensitivity\nwhen including substructures. Points in the parameter space that could be\nresolved by GLAST are the \u03b3\u03b3 fluxes above the sensitivity lines. The green,\ndotted line marks the region already excluded by EGRET, assuming an NFW\nprofile with substructures.\n\n\fA. Sellerholm, J. Conrad, L. Bergstr\u0308om, J. Edsj\u00f6\n\nEGBR and Dark Matter\n\n93\n\nburst galaxies and starforming galaxies. Contributions from unresolved blazars,\nconsistent with the EGRET blazar catalogue, could account for about 20% of\nthe measured EGRB at 1 GeV. Taking into account predictions of starburst\nand starforming galaxies one gets about the measured values of the EGRB\nat 1 GeV [17]. However, these models under-predict the \u03b3-ray flux at higher\nenergies, arguing for new, hard \u03b3-ray sources.\nThe background used in our sensitivity calculations consists only of unresolved blazars [6] where GLAST's increased sensitivity to point sources have\nbeen taken into account. In figure 1, this background can be compared to other\nbackground models as well as EGRET measurements of the EGBR. Note however that the backgrounds from [17] are not treated together in a consistent\nway, for instance with respect to the optical depth. However, this has been\ndone for the unresolved blazar model and the cosmological WIMPs.\n\n4\n\nGLAST sensitivity\n\nFast detector simulations [18] were done for a generic model of WIMPs annihilating into 2\u03b3 and into bb\u0304 for WIMP masses between 30 and 280 GeV. A \u03c72\nanalysis was performed, assuming that the background consists of unresolved\nblazars, to obtain a sensitivity plot in < \u03c3v > vs M\u03c7 . Also, to the background\nwe added an irreducible contribution from charged particles, at the level of\n10 % of the blazar background. It should be noted that for the calculations\npresented here we somewhat optimistically assume that we have an ideal extraction of the EGBR as well as a perfect understanding of the conventional\nastrophysical backgrounds.\nThe WIMP signal was computed using a NFW profile and including the effect\nof substructures, assuming that they constitute 5% of the mass and have four\ntimes the concentration parameter of the parent halo. The result, viewed in\nfigure 2, shows that GLAST is sensitive to total annihilation cross-sections of\nthe order 10\u221224 \u2212 10\u221227 cm3 s\u22121 , depending on the exact halo model, for low\nmasses and about an order of magnitude higher cross section for higher masses.\nIn figure 3 the line sensitivity of GLAST to IDM cosmological WIMPs can be\nseen. Since the IDM offers so much higher ratio between the line branching\nand continuum branching the sensitivity was calculated only for the lines as\n\u221a\nn\u03b3,\u03c7 / nbkg . The result is quite dependent on the choice of halo model. For the\nplain NFW profile GLAST cannot reach a 5\u03c3 level within one year but when\nadding substructures GLAST is sensitive to almost the entire parameter space\nof the IDM, at a 5\u03c3 level.\n\n\f94\n5\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that studying the EGBR with GLAST could offer an interesting\nway of indirect detection of WIMP DM. Also since the cosmological signal\ndiffers in many ways from other point like sources of DM, it will be a useful\ncompliment to such surveys. The level of sensitivity of GLAST still depends\non many unknowns, many of them associated with the fact that we do not\nknow enough about the nature of DM. But under our assumptions we find\nthat GLAST will be sensitive to a wide range of interesting WIMP candidates.\nHowever, both in the case of the generic and the IDM WIMP the signal needs\na light boost for GLAST to be able to cover the most interesting region which\ncould be achieved by adding substructures in the halos.\nReferences\n[1] Spergel et al.

The increased expansion rate has important consequences for the freeze out of the Dark Matter particles. Consequently,\nthe enhancement of the pre-BBN Hubble rate can be constrained by the\nupper bounds on the Dark Matter annihilation cross section derived from\nthe searches for indirect DM signals.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we are going to report on and extend the analyses of our papers\nRef. [1] and [2]. The basic idea, that we are going to explain further in Section\n2, is that by combining the constraint on Dark Matter relic abundance and\nannihilation cross section we can derive constraints on the enhancement of the\nHubble rate in the very early Universe. As a Dark Matter candidate we consider\n95\n\n\f96\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\na generic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), \u03c7, which is produced in\nthermal equilibrium in the early Universe. We shall assume that the WIMP\nmakes up the main part of the Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe. From\ncosmological observations we have that the CDM density falls in the following\nnarrow interval (at 2\u03c3 C.L.) [3]\n0.092 \u2264 \u03a9CDM h2 \u2264 0.124\n\n(1)\n\nwhere as usual \u03a9 denotes the ratio between the mean density and the critical\ndensity and h is the present Hubble constant in units of 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n2\n\nThe relic density calculation\n\nIn this section we present the main idea on which this paper is based: If the\nexpansion rate in the Universe differs from that of standard cosmology then this\naffects the freeze out of the CDM particles. This has been discussed in Ref. [4]\nfor the expansion rate of a scalar\u2013tensor gravity model, in Refs. [5] for the\ncase of a Quintessence model with a kination phase and in [6] for braneworld\nmodels. See also Refs. [7] for the case of anisotropic expansion and other models\nof modified expansion. To understand the idea we must solve the Boltzmann\nequation, which controls the relic density of the WIMP DM candidate, assumed\nto be in thermal equilibrium in the early Universe.\ndn\n= \u22123Hn \u2212 h\u03c3ann vi(n2 \u2212 n2eq )\ndt\n\n(2)\n\nwhere n is the WIMP number density, neq its equilibrium value and t the time.\nWhereas h\u03c3ann vi is the thermally averaged value of the WIMP annihilation\ncross section times the relative velocity and H(t) is the Hubble expansion rate.\nThis is the Boltzmann equation as it also looks in the standard case, but in our\ncase we imagine that the Hubble rate of standard cosmology has been substituted by the expansion rate of a modified cosmology, i.e. H(t) = A(t)Hstd (t).\nThe analytic solution of the modified Boltzmann equation is\n!\u22121\nZ \u221e\nheff (x) h\u03c3ann vi\n2\np\ndx\n(3)\n\u03a9\u03c7 h \u223c const *\ngeff (x) x2\nxf A(x)\n\nwhere heff and geff are respectively the entropy\u2013density and energy\u2013density\neffective degrees of freedom. We have also introduced the usual definition\nx = m\u03c7 /T , where m\u03c7 is the WIMP mass and T the temperature. The integration starts at the WIMP freeze\u2013out temperature and ends today. We note\nthat the standard solution is recovered when A(t) = 1.\n\n\fM. Schelke\n\nIndirect detection and the cosmological expansion\n\n97\n\nThe Boltzmann equation and its solution describes how the relic WIMP\ndensity is determined by the competition between the expansion of the Universe\nand the particle processes that create and destroy the WIMP. A large WIMP\nannihilation cross section makes the particle processes able to compete with\nthe dilution of the expansion for a longer time, and consequently reduces the\nrelic WIMP density. On the contrary, an increase in the Hubble rate, i.e.\nA > 1, will make a given WIMP freeze out earlier than in standard cosmology,\nwith the consequence of an increased relic WIMP density. Assuming that the\nWIMP makes up the mayor part of the CDM, we have very strong observational\nconstraints on its relic density, Eq. (1). For the density constraint to be fulfilled,\ncosmologies with an enhancement of the Hubble rate in the early Universe\nselect WIMP candidates with a larger annihilation cross section than does the\nstandard cosmology scenario. The larger the Hubble rate, the larger the cross\nsection. In the references mentioned in the beginning of this Section, it has been\nshown that the WIMP annihilation cross section favoured by models of modified\ncosmologies can be many orders of magnitude larger than the cross section\nfavoured in the standard case. This without violating observables related to\nBBN, Large Scale structure, General Relativity tests etc. In our papers Ref. [1]\nand [2], we went one step further. We used the fact that the WIMP annihilation\ncross section (today) is constrained from above by the results of indirect DM\nsearches. Combining this constraint with the constraint on the relic CDM\ndensity, we have derived constraints on the enhancement of the Hubble rate in\nthe early Universe. In these proceedings we report on our previous results and\nwe also show some new calculations for the prospects for the GLAST satellite.\n3\n\nModels with enhanced pre-BBN expansion\n\nAs we saw in the previous section, cosmological models with an enhanced Hubble expansion rate in the early Universe introduce interesting effects in the Dark\nMatter sector. In order not to be in conflict with the successful predictions of\nBBN and the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, we\nmust require that the Hubble rate recover the standard evolution no later than\nat the time of the BBN.\nH = A(T )Hstd\n\nT >\u223c 1 MeV ; H = Hstd\n\nT <\u223c 1 MeV\n\n(4)\n\nThere exist a number of interesting cosmological models with A(T ) > 1.\nIn this paper we discuss quintessence models with a kination phase, the RSII\nbraneworld model and scalar-tensor models. The enhancement function, A(T ),\nof these models can be described by the following parametrization:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\u03bd\nT \u2212 Tre\nT\n(5)\ntanh\nA(T ) = 1 + \u03b7\nTf\nTre\n\n\f98\n\nA(T)\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n\u03b7=10\n-2\nTre=10 GeV\nTf=17.3 GeV\n2\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\u03bd=-1\n\n10 4\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n\u03bd=0\n\n10\n\u03bd=1\n\n1\n\n\u03bd=2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nT (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: The enhancement function of Eq. 5 as a function of the temperature.\nNote that the time is running from right to left. The function is shown for 4\nvalues of the slope parameter \u03bd and for a specific choice of the other parameters.\nFigure from Ref. [1].\n\nfor temperatures T > Tre and A(T ) = 1 for T \u2264 Tre . By Tre we denote the\ntemperature at which the Hubble rate \"re\u2013enters\" the standard rate. The\nhyperbolic tangent has been chosen to assure that A(T ) goes continuously to\n\"1\", and H \u2192 Hstd before the \"re\u2013entering\" temperature. As we showed\nin Ref. [1], the derived constraint is insensitive to the value of the reentering\ntemperature, Tre , as long as this is much lower than the other temperature\nparameter, Tf . We choose Tre = 10\u22123 GeV (except for in Fig. 1) , which\nis always much lower than Tf for which we use the temperature where the\nDM particle freezes out in standard cosmology. Tf is not a free parameter,\nbut is determined by the WIMP mass and annihilation cross section. The\nenhancement function A(T ) of Eq. (5) is shown in Fig. 1 for some specific choice\nof the parameters. The slope parameter \u03bd is determined by the cosmological\nmodel: The RSII braneworld model [8] can be describe by \u03bd = 2, quintessence\nmodels with a kination phase by \u03bd = 1, while some specific scalar\u2013tensor model\ncan be approximated by \u03bd = \u22121. For further details about the parameters \u03bd\nand \u03b7 in different cosmologies, we refer to our papers [1] and [2]. We note that\n\n\fM. Schelke\n\nIndirect detection and the cosmological expansion\n\n99\n\nA(Tf ) = \u03b7 (for \u03b7 \u226b 1 and Tf \u226b Tre ). In Sec. 5 we derive the bound on \u03b7.\n4\n\nUpper bounds on the cross section\n\nAs we found in Section 2, we can derive constraints on the expansion rate in\nthe early Universe if we can constrain the WIMP annihilation cross section.\nWhat matters is clearly the WIMP annihilation cross section in the early Universe. In this paper we are going to assume that the cross section is dominantly\ntemperature\u2013independent (or s\u2013wave). This mean that we directly can use the\nconstraints on the WIMP annihilation cross section today, which can be derived from the data of indirect searches for Dark Matter. Some examples of\ndeviation from this case was discussed in our paper [1].\nLet us first consider the upper bound on the WIMP annihilation cross\nsection derived from the HESS data of the \u03b3\u2013ray signal from the Galactic\nCenter (GC). The HESS Collaboration has reported in Refs. [9] on a power\u2013\nlaw shaped spectrum of very high energy \u03b3\u2013rays from a point\u2013like source in the\nGC. The GC hosts different astrophysical candidates for the observed spectrum.\nAlso annihilating WIMP would give rise to a \u03b3-ray signal. As it was discussed\nin e.g. [10] it is very difficult to explain all the HESS GC point-like signal by\nannihilating CDM. As also done in Ref. [10] we therefore try to explain the\nHESS signal by adding a WIMP signal to a power law kE\u03b3\u0393 assumed to come\nfrom some astrophysical source. The power\u2013law parameters k and \u0393 and the\nWIMP annihilation cross section are taken as free parameters. For each DM\nhalo model and each choice of WIMP mass, we make a \u03c72 analysis to find the\nmaximum allowed value of the WIMP annihilation cross section, which is in\nagreement with the HESS data. For further details of this analysis see Ref. [2].\nIn Fig. 2 we show the HESS upper limit on the WIMP annihilation cross\nsection as a function of the WIMP mass. In this paper we show the result only\nfor the case of a NFW halo profile. As we have shown in Ref. [2] the bound can\ndiffer by many orders of magnitude from one halo profile to another. In Fig. 2\nwe also show the upper bound from searches for an indirect WIMP signal in the\ncosmic antiproton flux. The observed flux can be explained by the standard\nproduction from spallation of nuclei on the diffuse Milky Way gas, but the\nerror\u2013bars also leave a little room for a signal of exotic origin. In the Figure we\nshow the bound found by using the best\u2013fit values for the galactic propagation\nand diffusion parameters. For more details on the derivation of the antiproton\nbound we refer to our paper Ref. [1] and references therein. As a new feature\nwe have included in Fig. 2 the prospects for the GLAST satellite\u2013based \u03b3\u2013ray\ntelescope. The GLAST sensitivity has been estimated in e.g. Ref. [11]. We\nuse their result for a WIMP model independent framework. They have added\nthe \u03b3\u2013ray signal from a dominant bb\u0304 WIMP annihilation channel to a standard\n\n\f100\n\n-2\n\n<\u03c3 v>max (GeV )\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n-4\n\nHESS\n(NFW)\n\n-5\n\n-6\n\ns\n\non\n\not\n\npr\n\nint\n\n-7\n\na\n\n)\n\nFW\n\n10\n10\n10\n\n-8\n\nT\nAS\n\n(N\n\nGL\n-9\n\n\u2206(\u03a9h )std\n2\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nm\u03c7 (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: Upper bounds on the WIMP annihilation cross section as a function\nof the WIMP mass.

The resulting 3\u03c3 GLAST reach is shown in\nour Fig. 2, assuming a NFW halo profile and 4 years of data taking. For\nfurther details we refer to Ref. [11] and references therein. WIMP's with an\nannihilation cross section below the GLAST line in Fig. 2 cannot be detected\nby GLAST.\nFinally, Fig. 2 also show the small band of the WIMP annihilation cross\nsection derived applying the CDM relic density constraint, Eq. (1), and assuming the standard cosmological model and a temperature\u2013independent WIMP\nannihilation cross section. Models, that stay above this \"density\u2013band\" would\nbe underabundant in standard cosmology. The idea, that we explained in Section 2, is now that in models with an enhanced pre-BBN Hubble rate we can\nfill all the space between the lower and the upper limit of the cross section and\nstill fulfil the density constraint.

It is interesting to note that\nthis means that we constrain the expansion rate in the very early Universe, at\nTf which is much earlier than BBN. Furthermore, once we know \u03b7, we know\nA(T ) at any temperature for a given cosmological model and Tf .\nFor each WIMP mass we take the upper bound on the WIMP annihilation\ncross section, h\u03c3ann vi0 , as it can be found from Fig. 2. For the current bound\nwe combine the antiproton and the HESS bound, taking always the most constraining of the two. For the future prospects we use the GLAST sensitivity\nlimit. From the WIMP mass and cross section we can determine Tf , the WIMP\nfreeze\u2013out temperature in standard cosmology. For each cosmological model,\n\u03bd, we then solve the Boltzmann Equation while making a scan in the enhancement parameter \u03b7. The upper bound on \u03b7 is the one where the solution of the\nBoltzmann Equation gives a WIMP density equal to the observational upper\nbound in Eq. (1). We note again that this method is based on the assumption\n\n\f102\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nthat the WIMP annihilation cross section is temperature\u2013independent. We\nshow the result in Fig. 3 for four different choices of the slope\u2013parameter \u03bd.\nThe lower mass limit of the curves are not exact, but merely due to the step-size\nin the scan. We see that the derived constraints are very strong for low WIMP\nmasses. We see that the exact limit depend strongly on the cosmological model,\nbeing strongest for a scalar\u2013tensor model, \u03bd = \u22121. As we showed in Ref. [2],\nthe derived limits depend also very strongly on the halo profile chosen. The\nstrongest constraints were found for steep halo profiles like the Moore profile.\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have shown that indirect searches for Dark Matter can be\nused to derive strong constraints on the possible enhancement of the Hubble\nexpansion rate in the very early Universe.\nReferences\n[1] M.

By assuming that CR sources are distributed like supernova remnants (SNRs) we\nestimated the spatial distribution of primary nuclei by solving numerically the diffusion equation. For the first time in this context we used\ndiffusion coefficients as determined from Montecarlo simulations of particle propagation in turbulent magnetic fields. Concerning the ISM, we\nconsidered recent models for the H2 and HI spatial distributions which encompass the Galactic Centre (GC) region. Above the GeV we found that\nthe angular distribution of the simulated \u03b3-ray emission along the GP\nmatches well EGRET measurements. We compare our predictions with\nthe experimental limits/observations by MILAGRO and TIBET AS\u03b3 (for\n\u03b3-rays) and by AMANDA-II (for neutrinos) and discuss the perspectives\nfor a km3 neutrino telescope to be built in the North hemisphere.\n\n103\n\n\f104\n1\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nIntroduction\n\nSeveral orbital observatories and especially EGRET [1, 2], found that, at least\nup to 10 GeV, the Galaxy is pervaded by a \u03b3-ray diffuse radiation. While\na minor component of that emission is likely to be originated by unresolved\npoint-like sources, the dominant contribution is expected to come from the\ninteraction of galactic cosmic rays (CR) with the interstellar medium (ISM).\nSince the spectrum of galactic CRs extends up to the EeV, the spectrum of the\n\u03b3-ray diffuse galactic emission should also continue well above the energy range\nprobed by EGRET. That will be soon probed by GLAST [3] up to 300 GeV\nand by air shower arrays (ASA) (e.g. MILAGRO [4, 5] and TIBET [6]) above\nthe TeV.\nAbove the GeV, the main \u03b3-ray emission processes are expected to be the decay of \u03c0 0 produced by the scattering of CR nuclei onto the diffuse gas (hadronic\nemission) and the Inverse Compton (IC) emission of relativistic electrons colliding onto the interstellar radiation field (leptonic emission). It is unknown,\nhowever, what are the relative contributions of those two processes and how\nthey change with the energy and the position in the sky (this is so called\nhadronic-leptonic degeneracy). Several numerical simulations have been performed in order to interpret EGRET as well as forthcoming measurements at\nhigh energy (see e.g. [7, 8] ). Generally, those simulations predict the hadronic\nemission to be dominating between 0.1 GeV and few TeV, while between 1 and\n100 TeV a comparable, or even larger IC contribution may be allowed.\nThe 1-100 TeV energy range, on which we focus here, is also interesting\nfrom the point of view of neutrino astrophysics. In that energy window neutrino telescopes (NTs) can look for up-going muon neutrinos and reconstruct\ntheir arrival direction with an angular resolution better than 1\u25e6 . Since hadronic\nscattering give rise to \u03b3-rays and neutrinos in a known ratio, the possible measurement of the neutrino emission from the GP may allow to get rid of the\nhadronic-leptonic degeneracy.\nIn this contribution we discuss the main results of a recent work where we\nmodelled the \u03b3-ray and neutrino diffuse emissions of the Galaxy due to CR\nhadronic scattering [9]. Our work improves previous analysis under several\naspects which concern the distribution of CR sources; the way we treated CR\ndiffusion which accounts for spatial variations of the diffusion coefficients; the\ndistribution of the atomic and molecular hydrogen.\n2\n\nThe spatial structure of the ISM\n\nIn order to assess the problem of the propagation of CRs and their interaction\nwith the ISM we need the knowledge of three basic physical inputs, namely:\nthe distribution of SuperNova Remnants (SNR) which we assume to trace that\nof CR sources; the properties of the Galactic Magnetic Field (GMF) in which\n\n\fC. Evoli\n\nDiffuse Gamma-Ray and Neutrino Emission of the Galaxy\n\n105\n\nthe propagation occurs; the distribution of the diffuse gas providing the target\nfor the production of \u03b3-rays and neutrinos through hadronic interactions.\n2.1 The SNR distribution in Galaxy\nSeveral methods to determine the SNR distribution in the Galaxy are discussed\nin the literature (see e.g. that based on the surface brightness - distance (\u03a3\u2212D)\nrelation [10]). Here we adopt a SNR distribution which was inferred from\nobservations of pulsars (for core-collapsed SNe) and old progenitor stars (for\ntype-Ia SNe)[11]. Respect to surveys based on the \u03a3\u2212D relations, this approach\nis less plagued from sistematics and it agrees with the observed distribution of\nradioactive nuclides like of 26 Al which are known to be correlated with SNRs.\nA similar approach was followed in [12] where, however, the contribution of\ntype I-a SNRs (which is dominating in the inner 1 kpc) was disregarded.\n2.2 Regular and random magnetic fields\nThe Milky Way, as well as other spiral galaxies, is known to be permeated by\nlarge-scale, so called regular, magnetic fields as well as by a random, or turbulent, component. The orientation and strength of the regular fields is measured\nmainly by means of Faraday Rotation Measurements (RMs) of polarised radio\nsources. From those observations it is known that the regular field in the disk\nof the Galaxy fills a halo with half-width zr \u2243 1.5 kpc and that, out of galactic bulge, it is almost azimuthally oriented. Following [13, 14] we adopt the\nfollowing analytical distribution in the halo:\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\nr \u2212 r\u2299\n,\n(1)\nBreg (r, z) = B0 exp \u2212\nrB\n2 cosh(z/zr )\nwhere Bo \u2261 Breg (r\u2299 , 0) \u2243 2 \u03bcG is the strength at the Sun circle. The parameters rB is poorly known. Fortunately, we found that our final results are practically independent on its choice. In the following we adopt rB \u2243 r\u2299 \u2243 8.5 kpc.\nMore uncertain are the properties of the turbulent component of the GMF.\nHere we assume that its strength follows the behaviour\nBran (r, z) = \u03c3(r) Breg (r, 0)\n\n1\n.\n2 cosh(z/zt )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3(r) provides a measure of the turbulence strength. Here we assume zt =\n3 kpc. From polarimetric measurements and RMs is known GMF are chaotic on\nall scales below Lmax \u223c 100 pc. The power spectrum of the those fluctuations\nis also poorly known. While in [9] we considered both a Kolmogorov (B 2 (k) \u221d\nk \u22125/3 ) and a Kraichnan (B 2 (k) \u221d k \u22123/2 ) power spectra in the following we\nconsider only a Kolmogorov spectrum.\n\n\f106\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n2.3 The gas distribution\nThe model which we consider here is based on a suitable combination of different analyses which have been separately performed for the disk and the\ngalactic bulge. For the H2 and HI distributions in the bulge we use a detailed\n3D model recently developed by Ferriere et al. [15] on the basis of several\nobservations. For the molecular hydrogen in the disk we use the well known\nBronfman's et al. model [16]. Since in [16] r\u2299 = 10 kpc was adopted, we\ncorrect the gas density and the scale height given in that paper to make them\ncompatible with the value r\u2299 = 8.5 kpc which we use in this work. Furthermore, we accounted for a radial dependence of the H2 -CO conversion factor\nX. Here we assume X = 0.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 K\u22121 km\u22121 s for r < 2 kpc and\nX = 1.2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 K\u22121 km\u22121 s for 2 < r < 10 kpc. For the HI distribution\nin the disk, we adopt Wolfire et al. [17] analytical model. We also assume that\nthe ISM helium is distributed in the same way of hydrogen nuclei.\n3\n\nCR diffusion\n\nThe ISM is a turbulent magneto-hydro-dynamic (MHD) environment. Since\nthe Larmor radius of high energy nuclei is smaller than Lmax , the propagation of those particles takes place in the spatial diffusion regime. We solved\nthe diffusion equation following the approach developed in [18]. In the energy\nrange considered in our work energy losses/gains can be safely neglected. Since\nwe assume cylindrical symmetry the only physically relevant component of the\ndiffusion tensor is the perpendicular diffusion coefficient D\u22a5 . We verified that\nHall diffussion can be neglected at the energies considered in our work. It is\ncrucial to know how D\u22a5 changes as a function of the energy and of the turbulence strength (which, as we mentioned, may depend on the position). Here\nwe adopt expression of D\u22a5 (E, \u03c3) which have been derived by means of Montecarlo simulation of charge particle propagation in turbulent magnetic fields\n[19]. Respect to other works, where a mean value of the diffusion coefficient\nhas been estimated from the observed secondary/primary ratio of CR nuclear\nspecies (see e.g. [8]), our approach offers the advantage to provide the diffusion\ncoefficients point-by-point. We solved the diffusion equation using the CrankNicholson method by imposing N (E) = 0 at the edge of the MF turbulent halo\n(r = 30 kpc, z = 3kpc) and by requiring that it matches the observed CR\nspectra at the Earth position for most abundant nuclear species.\n4\n\nMapping the \u03b3-ray and \u03bd emission\n\nUnder the assumption that the primary CR spectrum is a power-law and that\nthe differential cross-section follows a scaling behaviour (which is well justified\nat the energies considered here), the \u03b3-ray (muon neutrino) emissivity due to\n\n\fC.

By doing that we assume that\nthe energy dependence of D\u22a5 does not change going from the TeV down to few\nGeVs. In fig. 4 we compare the longitudinal \u03b3-ray flux profile as obtained with\nour model with EGRET measurements in the 4 \u2212 10 GeV energy range [21, 2].\nClearly, as we used an analytical expression for the gas distribution, not all fea-\n\nFigure 1: The simulated \u03b3-ray flux profile along the GP integrated between 4\nand 10 TeV (red, continuos line) is compared with that measured by EGRET\n(black, dashed line).

No tuning, neither of the SNR radial distribution nor of the XCO\nconversion factor, seems to be required to match the emission from the GP.\n5\n\nDiscussion\n\nReassured by our good description of EGRET data, we modelled the hadronic\nemission above the TeV both for the \u03b3-rays an the neutrinos. In Fig.2 we\nshow two significant \u03b3-ray flux profiles above the TeV. In Tab. 1 we compare\nour results with MILAGRO and TIBET AS\u03b3 measurements. We found that,\nwhile over most of the sky the predicted diffuse flux is significantly below the\nexperimental upper limits, in the Cygnus region and in the GC Ridge [22] the\nobserved flux exceed the theoretical expectations. We interpret those excesses\n\nFigure 2: The \u03b3-ray flux profiles along the GP (left panel) and along l = 0\n(right panel) for E > 1 TeV, averaged over 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 angular bins.

Being\nlocated at the South Pole, AMANDA cannot probe the emission from the\nGC. In the region 33\u25e6 < l < 213\u25e6, |b| < 2\u25e6 , and assuming a spectral index\n\u03b1 = 2.7, their present constraint is \u03a6\u03bd\u03bc +\u03bd\u0304\u03bc (> 1 TeV) < 3.1\u00d710\u22129 (cm2 s sr)\u22121 .\nAccording to our model the expected flux in the same region is \u03a6\u03bd\u03bc +\u03bd\u0304\u03bc (>\n1 TeV) \u2243 4.2 \u00d7 10\u221211 (cm2 s sr)\u22121 . That will be hardly detectable even\nby IceCube. Since a neutrino telescope placed in the North hemisphere may\nhave better changes, we investigated this possibility in details. Assuming that\nsuch an instrument will be placed at the same position of ANTARES [24] and\nhave a 40 times larger effective area we estimated the expected signal and the\nbackground along the GP. Unfortunately, we found that the detection of the\nsmooth component of the diffuse emission may require more than 10 years\nof data taking. However, as we mentioned in the above, several observations\nsuggest that the CR and gas distributions may be more clumpy than what\nconsidered in this work. This may lead to a significant enhancement of the\nneutrino flux from some regions as may be the case for the GC ridge [20] and\nthe Cygnus region [25, 26].\nReferences\n[1] S. D.

Therefore we\nassume here that the integrated luminosity collected by the end of 2008 will\nrange between 100 pb\u22121 and 10 f b\u22121 per experiment, and we discuss the LHC\nphysics potential in this range.\nOver the first year of operation, huge event samples should be available\nfrom known Standard Model (SM) processes, which will allow to complete the\ncommissioning of the detectors, to fully debug the software and also to look for\npossible deviation from SM prediction, as possible indication of new physics.\nIt will take certainlly some time before the accelerator ramps up in luminosity\nand the detectors are fully understood and optimally calibrated. Nevertheless\nwe know that possible new physics phenomena could have large cross sections\nand striking topologies, that even a limited amount of collected data and a nonultimate detector performance could lead to exciting results. In the following\nsection, the strategy for commissioning the detector and the prospect for early\ndiscoveries will be presented.\n2\n\nATLAS detector commissioning strategy\n\nThe ATLAS experiment, approved in January 1996, is a general purpose detector. The construction is basically finished, the installation in the cavern is\nwell advanced and the commissioning phase using cosmic rays is in progress.\nA detailed description of the detector can be found in ref.[5]. It is the biggest\namong the LHC experiments, with its diameter of \u223c 22m, a length of \u223c 44m\nand a total weight of \u223c 7000 tons. The main features are summarized here :\n\u2022 precision electromagnetic calorimetry for electrons and photons ;\n\u2022 a large acceptance hadronic calorimetry for jets and missing transverse\nenergy measurements ;\n\u2022 a high-precision muon momentum measurement with the possibility at\nthe highest luminosity of using the external muon spectrometer alone ;\n\u2022 triggering and measurements of particles at low pT thresholds.\nOne important question to address concernes the detector performance at the\nbeginning of the data taking. Based on quality checks during the construction,\non the known precision of the hardware calibration and alignment systems, on\ntest-beam measurements and on simulation studies we expect that the initial\nuniformity of the electromagnetic calorimeters (ECAL) should be at the level\nof 1% for the ECAL liquid-argon calorimeter. Prior to data taking, the jet\nenergy scale may be established to about 10% from a combination of testbeam measurements and simulation studies. The tracker alignment in the\n\n\fA. Di Ciaccio\n\nPhysics at the start of the LHC\n\n113\n\ntransverse plane is expected to be known at the level of 20\u03bcm in the best case\nfrom surveys, from the hardware alignment systems and possibly from some\nstudies with cosmic muons and beam halo events. This performance should be\nsignificantly improved as soon as the first data will be available and, thanks\nto the huge event rates expected at the LHC, the ultimate statistical precision\nshould be achieved after a few days/weeks of data taking. Table 1 shows the\ndata samples expected to be recorded by ATLAS for some example physics\nprocesses and for an integrated luminosity of 10f b\u22121.

The hypothetical production of\ngluinos with a mass of 1 T eV is also considered.\nDuring the first year(s) of data taking, the big event samples will allow\nto calibrate the detectors, tune the software and understand SM physics. We\nstress that this is possible even if the integrated luminosity collected during\nthe first year is a factor of hundred smaller, i.e. 100pb\u22121. More in details, the\nfollowing goals can be addressed with the first data:\n\u2022 Commissioning and calibration of the detectors in situ. Understanding the trigger performance in an unbiased way, with a combination of\nminimum-bias events, QCD jets collected with various thresholds, single and dilepton samples. ZZ \u2192 ll is a gold-plated process for a large\nnumber of studies, e.g. to set the absolute electron and muon scales in\nthe ECAL and tracking detectors respectively, whereas tt\u0304 events can be\nused for instance to establish the absolute jet scale and to understand\nthe b-tagging performance.\n\u2022 Perform extensive measurements of the main SM physics processes, e.g.\ncross sections and event features for minimum-bias, QCD dijet, W, Z,\ntt\u0304 production, etc. These measurements will be compared to the predictions of the MonteCarlo (MC) simulations, which will already be quite\nconstrained from theory and from studies at the Tevatron and HERA\n\n\f114\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nenergies. Typical initial precisions may be 10-20% for cross section measurements, and a few GeV on the top-quark mass, and will likely be\nlimited by systematic uncertainties after just a few weeks of data taking.\n\u2022 Prepare the road to discoveries by measuring the backgrounds of possible\nnew physics channels. Processes like W/Z+jets, QCD multijet and tt\u0304\nproduction are the main backgrounds for a large number of new searches\nand need to be understood in all details.\nAs an example of initial measurement with limited detector performance,\nfig. 1 shows the reconstructed top-quark signal in the channell tt\u0304 \u2192 bjjbl\u03bd,\nas obtained from a simulation of the ATLAS detector. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 300pb\u22121, which can be collected in a\nweek of data taking at L = 1033 cm\u22121 s\u22121 . A very simple analysis was used to\nselect these events, requiring an isolated electron or muon with pT \u2265 20 GeV,\nthe event ETmiss > 20 GeV and only four jets with pT \u2265 40 GeV . The invariant\nmass of the three jets with the highest pT is plotted. No kinematic fit is made,\nand no b-tagging of some of the jets is required, assuming conservatively that\nthe b-tagging performance would not have been well understood yet. Figure 1\nshows that, even under these conditions, a clear top signal should be observed\nabove the background after a few weeks of data taking. In turn, this signal can\nbe used for an early validation of the detector performance. For instance, if the\ntop mass is wrong by several GeV , this would indicate a problem with the jet\nenergy scale. Furthermore, top events are an excellent sample to understand\nthe b-tagging performance of ATLAS.\n3\n\nSearch for discoveries\n\nOnly after a full understanding of the SM processes one can start a serious\nwork to extract a convincing discovery signal from the data. Some examples of\nnew physics in the first year(s) of operation are briefly discussed below: namely\na possible Z \u2032 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 signal, a SUSY signal, and the Standard Model Higgs\nboson.\n3.1 Z \u2032\nA particle of mass 1-2 TeV decaying into e+ e\u2212 pairs, such as a possible new\ngauge boson Z \u2032 , is probably the easiest signal to be discovered at the LHC,\nfor several reasons. First, if the branching ratio into leptons is at least at the\npercent level as for the Z boson, the expected number of events after all experimental cuts is relatively large, e.g. about ten for an integrated luminosity\nas low as 300pb\u22121 and a particle mass of 1.5 T eV . Second, the dominant background, dilepton Drell-Yan production, is small in the T eV region, and even if\nit is a factor of two or three larger than expected today (which is unlikely for\n\n\fA. Di Ciaccio\n\nPhysics at the start of the LHC\n\n115\n\nsuch a theoretically well-known process), it would still be negligible compared\nto the signal. Finally, the signature will be very clear, since it will appear as a\nresonant peak on top of a negligeable background. These expectations are not\nbased on ultimate detector performance, since they hold also if the calorimeter\nresponse is understood to a conservative level of a few percent.\n3.2 Supersymmetry\nFinding a convincing signal of SUSY in the early phases of the LHC operation\nis not straightforward, since good calibration of the detectors and detailed\nunderstanding of the numerous backgrounds are required. As soon as these two\npre-requisites are satisfied, observation of a SUSY signal should be relatively\neasy and fast. This is because of the huge production cross sections, and hence\nevent rates, even for squark and gluino masses as large as 1 T eV , as can be\nseen in Table 1, due to the clear signature of such events in most scenarios.\nTherefore, by looking for final states containing several high pT jets and large\nETmiss , which is the most powerful and model independent signature if R parity\nis conserved, the ATLAS experiment should be able to discover squarks and\ngluinos up to a masses of 1.5 T eV , after one month of data taking at L =\n1033 cm\u22121 s\u22121 , as shown in fig. 2.\nAlthough detailed measurements of the SUSY particle masses will likely\ntake several years, it should nevertheless be possible to obtain a first determination of the SUSY mass scale quickly after discovery. This is illustrated in\nfig. 3, which shows the striking SUSY signal on top of the SM background,\nexpected at a point in the minimal SUGRA parameter space where squark and\ngluino masses are about 1 T eV . The plotted variable, called \"effective mass\"\n(Mef f ), is defined as the scalar sum of the event ETmiss and of the transverse\nenergies of the four highest jets. More precisely, the position of the peak of\nthe Mef f signal distribution (see fig.3) moves to larger and or smaller values\nwith increasing/decresing squark and gluino masses. Therefore a measurement\nof the signal peak position should also provide a first fast determination of the\nmass scale of SUSY. The expected precision is about 20% for an integrated\nluminosity of 10f b\u22121, at least in minimal models like mSUGRA.\nA crucial detector performance issue for an early SUSY discovery is a reliable reconstruction of the event ETmiss , which could be contaminated by several\ninstrumental effects (calorimeter non-linearities, cracks in the detector, etc.).\nFinal states with non-genuine ETmiss can be rejected by requiring the event primary vertex to be located close to the interaction centre (which also helps to\nsuppress the background from cosmic and beam-halo muons), no jets pointing\nto detector cracks, and that the missing pT vector is not aligned with any jet.\nConcerning the physics backgrounds (e.g. Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd +jets, tt\u0304 production, QCD\nmultijet events), most of them can be measured by using control samples. For\ninstance, Z \u2192 ll +jet production provides a normalization of the Z \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd +jets\n\n\f116\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 1: Tree jet invariant mass distribution for events tt\u0304 \u2192 bjjbl\u03bd, simulated\nin ATLAS, as obtained with the selection explained in the text with an integrated luminosity of 300pb\u22121 . The dots with error bars show a clear top signal\nplus the background. The dashed line shows the W + 4jets background alone\n(ALPGEN MC).\nbackground. More difficult to handle is the residual background from QCD\nmultijet events with fake ETmiss produced by the above-mentioned instrumental effects. An important element in the ability to calibrate these backgrounds\nusing the theoretical MC predictions to extrapolate from the signal-free to the\nsignal-rich regions, is the reliability of the MC themselves. Their level of accuracy and their capability to describe complex final states, such as the multijet\ntopology typical of new phenomena like SUSY, have improved significantly over\nthe past few years[6].\n3.3 Standard Model Higgs Boson\nThe possibility of discovering a SM Higgs boson at the LHC during the first\nyear(s) of operation depends very much on the Higgs boson mass, as shown\nin fig. 4. If the Higgs boson mass is larger than 180 GeV, discovery may be\nrelatively easy thanks to the gold-plated H \u2192 4l channel, which is essentially\nbackground-free. The main requirement in this case is an integrated luminosity\nof at least 5 \u2212 10pb\u22121, since the signal has a cross section of only a few f b. The\nlow-mass region close to the LEP limit (114.4 GeV ) is much more difficult.\nThe expected sensitivity for a Higgs mass of 115 GeV and for the first good\n(i.e. collected with well calibrated detectors) 10pb\u22121 is summarized in Table 2.\n\n\fA.

It will not be\neasy to extract a convincing signal with only 10f b\u22121, because the significances\nof the individual channels are small, and because an excellent knowledge of\nthe backgrounds and optimal detector performances are required. Finally, all\nthree channels demand relatively low trigger thresholds (at the level of 20-30\nGeV on the lepton or photon pT ), and a control of the backgrounds to a few\npercent. These requirements are especially challenging during the first year(s)\nof operation. Therefore, the contribution of the both experiments, ATLAS and\nCMS, and the observation of all three channels, will be crucial for an early\ndiscovery.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe LHC offers the opportunity of major discoveries already at the very beginning. The conditions for discovery require a very good understanding of\nthe detector performance and of the Standard Model and QCD processes. The\nperformance of the LHC at the beginning is the next crucial issue.\nWith an integrated luminosity between 100 pb\u22121 and 10 f b\u22121 , a Z \u2032 boson\nwith M > 1 T eV can be discovered, as well a possible SUSY signal and the\nHiggs boson with M > 130 GeV . More difficult is instead the discovery of a\nlight Higgs Boson.\nReferences\n[1] P. Fayet and S. Ferrara, Phys. Rep. C 32, 249 (1977);H. P. Nilles, Phys.\nRep. C 110, 1 (1984).\n[2] N.

Some of the many possible corollary model dependent quests for the candidate particle either have been carried out or\nare in progress; many of the related aspects are still under investigation.\nAt present the second generation DAMA/LIBRA set-up is in data taking. Many searches for other rare processes have been and are under\ninvestigation as well.\n\n121\n\n\f122\n1\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nIntroduction\n\nA large number of possibilities exists for candidates as Dark Matter (DM) particles in the Universe either produced at rest or non relativistic at decoupling\ntime. DM particles at galactic scale can be directly investigated through their\ninteraction on suitable deep underground target-detectors. The detector's signal can be induced either by recoiling nucleus or, in case of inelastic scattering,\nalso by successive de-excitation gamma's; moreover, other possibilities, which\ndirectly involve practically only ionization/excitation phenomena in the detector, are open (see e.g. later) as well as the excitation of bound electrons\nin scatterings on nuclei giving rise contemporaneously to recoiling nuclei and\nelectromagnetic radiation, etc.\nThe DAMA/NaI experiment was realized having the main aim to investigate\nin a model independent way the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo.\nFor this purpose, we planned to exploit the effect of the Earth revolution around\nthe Sun on the DM particles interactions in a suitable low background set-up\nplaced deep underground. In fact, as a consequence of its annual revolution, the\nEarth should be crossed by a larger flux of DM particles around roughly June\n2nd (when its rotational velocity is summed to the one of the solar system with\nthe respect to the Galaxy) and by a smaller one around roughly December 2nd\n(when the two velocities are subtracted). This annual modulation signature\n\u2013 originally suggested in the middle of '80 in ref. [1] \u2013 is very distinctive\nsince a seasonal effect induced by DM particles must simultaneously satisfy all\nthe following requirements: (i) the rate must contain a component modulated\naccording to a cosine function; (ii) with one year period; (iii) a phase roughly\naround \u223c June 2nd; (iv) this modulation must only be found in a well-defined\nlow energy range, where DM particles can induce signals; (v) it must only apply\nto those events in which just one detector of many actually \"fires\", since the\nprobability that DM particles would have multiple interactions is negligible;\n(vi) the modulation amplitude in the region of maximal sensitivity must be .\n7% for usually adopted halo distributions, but it can be significantly larger in\ncase of other possible scenarios such as e.g. those of refs. [2, 3].\nThe DAMA/NaI experiment was located deep underground in the Gran\nSasso National Laboratory of I.N.F.N.. It has been part of the DAMA project,\nwhich also includes several other low background set-ups, such as: i) DAMA/LXe\n[4]; ii) DAMA/R&D [5]; iii) the new second generation larger mass NaI(Tl)\nradiopure set-up DAMA/LIBRA; iv) DAMA/Ge detector for sample measurements which is installed in the LNGS Ge facility [6]. Detailed descriptions of\nthe DAMA/NaI set-up, of its upgrading occurred in 2000 and of its performances have been given e.g. in [7, 8, 9, 10]. Thanks to its radiopurity and\nfeatures, DAMA/NaI has also investigated other approaches for DM particles\nand several other rare processes [11].\n\n\fR. Bernabei et al.\n\n2\n\n123\n\nDirect Dark Matter search\n\nDAMA/NaI model-independent result\n\nResiduals (cpd/kg/keV)\n\nThe DAMA/NaI set-up has pointed out the presence of a modulation satisfying\nthe many peculiarities of a DM particle induced effect, reaching an evidence at\n6.3 \u03c3 C.L. over seven annual cycles [7, 8]. In particular, the residual rate of the\nsingle-hit events in the cumulative (2-6) keV energy interval has a modulated\ncosine-like behaviour at 6.3 \u03c3 C.L. and the fit for this cumulative energy interval\noffers modulation amplitude equal to (0.0200 \u00b1 0.0032) cpd/kg/keV, a phase\nt0 = (140 \u00b1 22) days and a period T = (1.00 \u00b1 0.01) year, all parameters kept\nfree in the fit. The period and phase agree with those expected in the case\nof an effect induced by DM particles in the galactic halo (T = 1 year and t0\nroughly at \u2243 152.5th day of the year). The \u03c72 test on the (2\u20136) keV residual\nrate disfavours the hypothesis of unmodulated behaviour giving a probability\nof 7 * 10\u22124 (\u03c72 /d.o.f. = 71/37). The same data have also been investigated by\nother approaches as e.g. a Fourier analysis.\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\n-0.05\n-0.1\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500 600\nTime (day)\n\nFigure 1: Experimental residual rates over seven annual cycles for single-hit\nevents (open circles) \u2013 class of events to which DM particle events belong \u2013\nand over the last two annual cycles for multiple-hits events (filled triangles) \u2013\nclass of events to which DM particle events do not belong \u2013 in the (2\u20136) keV\ncumulative energy interval. They have been obtained by considering for each\nclass of events the data as collected in a single annual cycle and using in both\ncases the same identical hardware and the same identical software procedures.\nThe initial time is taken on August 7th . See ref. [8].\nA careful quantitative investigation of all the known possible sources of\nsystematics and side reactions has been regularly carried out and published at\ntime of each data release. No systematic effect or side reaction able to account\nfor the observed modulation amplitude and to satisfy all the requirements of\nthe signature has been found; for a detailed quantitative discussion see e.g. ref.\n[7, 8, 9].\n\n\f124\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nAs a further relevant investigation, the multiple-hits events collected during\nthe DAMA/NaI-6 and 7 running periods (when each detector was equipped\nwith its own Transient Digitizer with a dedicated renewed electronics) have\nbeen studied and analysed by using the same identical hardware and the same\nidentical software procedures as for the case of the single-hit events (see Fig. 1).\nThe fitted modulation amplitudes are: A = (0.0195 \u00b1 0.0031) cpd/kg/keV and\nA = \u2212(3.9\u00b17.9)*10\u22124 cpd/kg/keV for single-hit and multiple-hits residual rates,\nrespectively. Thus, evidence of annual modulation with proper features [7, 8]\nis present in the single-hit residuals (events class to which the DM particleinduced signals belong), while it is absent in the multiple-hits residual rate\n(event class to which only background events belong), offering an additional\nstrong support for the presence of DM particles in the galactic halo further\nexcluding any side effect either from hardware or software procedures or from\nbackground.\n3\n\nCorollary model-dependent quests\n\nCorollary investigations can also be pursued on the nature of the DM particle\ncandidate [7, 8, 3, 12, 13]. This latter investigation is instead model-dependent\nand - considering the large uncertainties which exist on the astrophysical, nuclear and particle physics assumptions and on the parameters needed in the\ncalculations - has no general meaning (as it is also the case of exclusion plots\nand of DM particle parameters evaluated in indirect detection experiments).\nLow and high WIMP mass candidates interacting with ordinary matter via:\ni) mixed SI&SD coupling; ii) dominant SI coupling; iii) dominant SD coupling;\niv) preferred SI inelastic scattering; have been considered for the WIMP class\nof DM particles in refs. [7, 8] for several (but still a limited number with\nrespect to the possibilities) given scenarios. The general solution for these\ncandidates is a 4-dimensional allowed volume in the space (\u03be\u03c3SI , \u03be\u03c3SD , \u03b8, mW ):\nexamples of slices of such a volume in some of the many possible scenarios can\nbe found in refs. [7, 8]. The DAMA/NaI allowed regions are well compatible\nwith theoretical expectations for neutralino in MSSM (see e.g. [14]). Also the\ninelastic DM particle scenario (where heavy nuclei are favoured with the respect\nto lighter ones) of ref. [2] has been analyzed obtaining an allowed volume in\nthe 3-dimensional space (\u03be\u03c3p , \u03b4, mW ) for the considered scenarios [7, 8].\nGalaxy hierarchical formation theories, numerical simulations, the discovery of the Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy (SagDEG) in 1994 and more\nrecent investigations suggest that the dark halo of the Milky Way can contain\nnon thermalized substructures. The effect of the inclusion in the considered\nhalo models of the contribution from the SagDEG has been included in the\nanalyses. A detailed discussion and examples of the modification of allowed\nvolumes/regions following such an inclusion are given in ref. [12].\n\n\fR. Bernabei et al.\n\nDirect Dark Matter search\n\n125\n\nIt has also been investigated the implication of the effect pointed out by A.\nB. Migdal in the 40's whose presence has so far been usually neglected in the\ndirect searches for WIMP Dark Matter candidates. This effect consists in the\nionization and the excitation of bound atomic electrons induced by the recoiling\natomic nucleus. In ref. [13] the theoretical arguments have been developed and\nexamples of the effect of the inclusion of this well known existing physical\neffect on the corollary quests of ref. [7] have been given. Additional allowed\nwindows in the GeV region are open and several candidates and support from\nastrophysical consideration are available.\nAn additional corollary quest for the candidate particle considering a light\n(\u2243 keV mass) bosonic candidate, either with pseudoscalar or with scalar coupling, as DM component in the galactic halo has also been carried out [3]. For\nthese candidates, the direct detection process is based on the total conversion\nin NaI(Tl) crystal of the mass of the absorbed bosonic particle into electromagnetic radiation. Thus, in these processes the target nuclei recoil is negligible\nand is not involved in the detection process. In ref. [3] the theoretical arguments have been developed and the obtained allowed regions for these very\ninteresting candidates [15] have been given.\nOther corollary quests are also available in literature, such as e.g. in refs.\n[16, 17, 14, 2, 18], and many other scenarios can be considered as well.\n4\n\nSome comparisons in the field\n\nNo experiment is available so far \u2013 with the exception of DAMA/LIBRA \u2013\nwhose results can be directly compared in a model independent way with that\nof DAMA/NaI. Thus, claims for contradictions have intrinsically no scientific\nmeaning. Some discussions can be found e.g. in ref.[7, 8] and in proceedings.\nIn particular, as regards some claimed model-dependent comparisons presented so far we just mention \u2013 among the many existing arguments \u2013 that\nthe other experiments available so far: i) are insensitive to the annual modulation signature; ii) use different exposed materials; iii) release just a marginal\nexposure (orders of magnitude lower than the one by DAMA/NaI) after several/many years underground; iv) exploit strong data selection and strong and\noften unsafe rejection techniques of their huge counting rate, becoming at the\nsame time insensitive to several DM candidates; v) generally quote in an incorrect/partial/not updated way the DAMA/NaI result; vi) consider a single\nmodel fixing all the astrophysical, nuclear and particle Physics assumptions as\nwell as all the theoretical and experimental parameters at a single questionable\nchoice 1 . Thus, e.g. for the WIMP case they do not account for the existing\n\n1 We\n\nnote that the naive and partial \"prescription\" of ref.

Moreover, in case the detection of the\nDM particles would involve electromagnetic signals (see, for example, the case\nof the light bosons discussed above, but also electromagnetic contribution in\nWIMP detection arising e.g. from known effect induced by recoiling nuclei), all\nthe other experiments do lose the signal in their data selection and \"rejection\"\nprocedures of the electromagnetic contribution to the counting rate.\nIn addition, the other experiments present many critical points e.g. regarding the energy threshold, the energy scale determination and the multiple\nselection procedures, on which their claimed \"sensitivities\" for a \"single\" set of\nassumptions and parameters' values are based. In particular, critical items in\nthe used \"rejection\" procedures are the related stabilities and efficiencies, the\nsystematics in the evaluations of the rejection factors (ranging from 10\u22124 to\n10\u22128 ), stabilities and monitoring of the spill-out factors, ...\nDiscussions at some extent are also reported e.g. in ref. [7, 8, 3, 12]; all\nthose general comments also hold in the substance for more recent claims, such\nas e.g. the one by XENON10. In particular, we remind that in this latter\nexperiment the physical energy threshold is unproved by source calibrations;\ndespite of the small light response (2.2 phe/keVee) an energy threshold of 2\nkeVee is claimed and no mention is done about the energy resolution at 2\nkeVee, notwithstanding whatever exclusion plot also critically depends on the\nused values for these quantities. Moreover, the claimed background rate in the\n\"fiducial\" volume is quite hard to be justified considering the design and all the\ninvolved materials of this detector. In addition, the used gas is natural xenon,\n\nparticular WIMP case cannot be defined \u2013 on the contrary of what appears in some papers \u2013\nas a \"standard theoretical model\". Such a paper summarized a single oversimplified approach\nadopted at that time. Its use as \"unique\" reference is obviously incorrect, since it did not\naccount at all for the level of knowledge on all the involved astrophysics, nuclear and particle\nphysics aspects and parameters, for the many possibilities open on the astrophysical, nuclear\nand particle physics aspects and for the different existing approaches as e.g. the annual\nmodulation signature, which requires \u2013 among others \u2013 time/energy correlation analysis.\n\n\fR.

Many cuts are applied, each\nof them introduces systematics, which \u2013 in addition \u2013 can vary along the data\ntaking and cannot be correctly evaluated with the needed precision just in a\nshort period of calibrations; etc.\nFor completeness, it is also worth to note that no results obtained with\ndifferent target material can intrinsically be directly compared even for the\nsame kind of coupling, although apparently all the presentations generally refer\nto cross section on the nucleon. The situation is much worse than the one in\nthe field of double beta decay experiments when different isotopes are used.\nAs regards the indirect searches, a comparison would always require the\ncalculation and the consideration of all the possible DM particle configurations\nin the given particle model, since it does not exist a biunivocal correspondence between the observables in the two kinds of experiments. However, the\npresent positive hints provided by indirect searches are not in conflict with the\nDAMA/NaI result.\nFinally, it is worth to note that \u2013 among the many corollary aspects still\nopen \u2013 there is f.i. the possibility that the particle dark halo can have more\nthan one component; some example have already been considered in literature.\n5\n\nThe new DAMA/LIBRA and beyond\n\nIn 1996 DAMA proposed to realize a ton set-up and a new R&D project\nfor highly radiopure NaI(Tl) detectors was funded and carried out for several years in order to realize - as an intermediate step - the second generation highly radiopure DAMA/LIBRA experiment (successor of DAMA/NaI).\nThus, as a consequence of the results of this second generation R&D, the new\nexperimental set-up DAMA/LIBRA (Large sodium Iodide Bulk for RAre processes), \u2243 250 kg highly radiopure NaI(Tl) scintillators, was funded and realized.

This allows for\nexistence of lumps of antimatter in our neighborhood and the possibility\nthat very compact antimatter objects make a part of cosmological dark\nmatter. Here I discuss the peculiar signatures which may be observed in\na near future.\n\nOne can conclude from simple considerations that there is much more matter than antimatter around us [1]. However, the origin of matter\u2013antimatter\nasymmetry in the universe is unknown: the Standard Model of particle physics\nis certainly unable to explain it and new physics is necessary [2]. Assuming a homogeneous and isotropic universe, from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis\n(BBN) [3] and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) [4] one\ncan determine the baryon to photon ratio \u03b2\n\u03b2=\n\nnB \u2212 nB\u0304\n\u2248 6 * 10\u221210\nn\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere nB \u226b nB\u0304 . On the other hand, the freeze-out abundances in a homogeneous baryo-symmetric universe would be nB /n\u03b3 = nB\u0304 /n\u03b3 \u223c 10\u221218 [5].\nHowever, Eq. (1) may not be the end of the story. One can indeed distinguish three main types of cosmological matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry:\n129\n\n\f130\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n1. Homogeneous matter dominated universe. Here \u03b2 is constant and\nthe universe is 100% matter dominated. This is certainly the most studied\ncase (see e.g. Refs. [6, 7]) but it is not very interesting for astrophysical\nobservations, because there is only one observable quantity, \u03b2, which\ncannot contain much information on high energy physics.\n2. Globally B-symmetric universe. Such a possibility appears quite reasonable and \"democratic\": the universe would consist of equal amount\nof similar domains of matter and antimatter. However, it seems observationally excluded or, to be more precise, the size of the domain where\nwe live should be at least comparable to the present day cosmological\nhorizon [8]. So, even in this case observations cannot determine nothing\nbut \u03b2.\n3. Inhomogeneous matter dominated universe. In this case the universe has a non-vanishing baryonic charge, but \u03b2 is not spatially constant\nand can even be negative in some space regions. Lumps of antimatter\ncan be scattered throughout the universe.\nHere I will discuss possible observational signatures of the third case: even\nif at first glance such a picture may appear strange, just because we are used\nto think about ordinary matter around us, there are no theoretical and experimental reasons to reject it. At present, the source of CP violation responsible\nfor the observed B-asymmetry in the universe is unknown, so generation of\nlumps of antimatter is not so exotic as one may naively think. Moreover, compact antimatter objects can easily survive in a matter dominated universe up\nto the present days. The talk is based on a work made in collaboration with\nAlexander Dolgov [9]. The reference baryogenesis mechanism is the one in [10].\nThe phenomenology of other scenarios can be found in Refs. [11, 12].\n1\n\nBaryogenesis framework\n\nLet us now briefly review the baryogenesis framework suggested in Ref. [10].\nThe basic ingredient is the Affleck-Dine mechanism [13], where a scalar field\n\u03c7 with non-zero baryonic charges have the potential with flat directions, that\nis directions along which the potential energy does not change. Due to the\ninfrared instability of light fields in de Sitter spacetime [14], during inflation\n\u03c7 can condense along the flat directions of the potential, acquiring a large\nexpectation value. In the course of the cosmological expansion, the Hubble\nparameter drops down and, when the mass of the field exceeds the universe\nexpansion rate, \u03c7 evolves to the equilibrium point and the baryonic charge\nstored in the condensate is transformed into quarks by B-conserving processes.\nSince here CP is violated stochastically by a chaotic phase of the field \u03c7, then\nduring the motion to the equilibrium state the matter and antimatter domains\n\n\fC. Bambi\n\nSearch for primordial antimatter\n\n131\n\nin a globally symmetric universe would be created. An interesting feature of\nthe model is that regions with a very high \u03b2, even close to one, could be formed.\nIf the scalar field \u03c7 is coupled to the inflaton \u03a6 with an interaction term\nof the kind V (\u03c7, \u03a6) = \u03bb|\u03c7|2 (\u03a6 \u2212 \u03a61 )2 , the \"gates\" to the flat directions might\nbe open only for a short time when the inflaton field \u03a6 was close to \u03a61 . In\nthis case, the probability of the penetration to the flat directions is small and\n\u03c7 could acquire a large expectation value only in a tiny fraction of space.\nThe universe would have a homogeneous background of baryon asymmetry\n\u03b2 \u223c 6 * 10\u221210 generated by the same field \u03c7, which did not penetrate to larger\ndistance through the narrow gate, or by another mechanism of baryogenesis,\nwhile the high density matter, \u03b2 > 0, and antimatter, \u03b2 < 0, regions would\nbe rare, although their contribution to the cosmological mass density might be\nsignificant or even dominant. In the simple model of Ref. [10], such high density\nbubbles could form clouds of matter or antimatter and more compact object\nlike stars, anti-stars or primordial black holes. In the non-collapsed regions,\nprimordial nucleosynthesis proceeded with large |\u03b2|, producing nuclei heavier\nthan those formed in the standard BBN [15].\n2\n\nPhenomenology\n\nIn what follows I will not dwell on possible scenarios of antimatter creation,\nbut simply consider phenomenological consequences of their existence in the\npresent day universe, in particular in the Galaxy. Some considerations on the\ncosmological evolution of lumps of antimatter in a baryon dominated universe\ncan be found in Refs. [9, 12].\n2.1 Indirect detection\nThe presence of anti-objects in the Galaxy today should lead to the production\nof the gamma radiation from matter\u2013antimatter annihilation. Hence we would\nexpect \u223c 100 MeV \u03b3 from the decay of \u03c0 0 mesons produced in pp\u0304 annihilation,\nwith an average of 4 \u03b3 per annihilation, and 2 \u03b3 from e+ e\u2212 annihilation with\nE = 0.511 MeV, if e+ e\u2212 annihilate at rest. In addition to the slow background\npositrons, there should be also energetic secondary positrons produced by pion\ndecays from pp\u0304 annihilation. Astronomical observations are seemingly more\nsensitive to pp\u0304 annihilation because the total energy release in pp\u0304 annihilation\nis 3 orders of magnitude larger than that in e+ e\u2212 annihilation and the galactic\ngamma ray background at 100 MeV is several orders of magnitude lower than\nthe one at 0.5 MeV. On the other hand, e+ e\u2212 annihilation gives the well defined\nline which is easy to identify.\nFor compact anti-objects like anti-stars, one find that the size of the antiobject, R, is much larger than the proton or electron mean free path inside the\nanti-object, \u03bbf ree \u223c 1/(\u03c3ann np\u0304 ), where \u03c3ann is the annihilation cross section\n\n\f132\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nfor pp\u0304 or e+ e\u2212 (they have similar order of magnitude) and np\u0304 is the antiproton\nnumber density in the anti-object. In this case, the annihilation takes place on\nthe surface, all the protons and electrons that hit the surface of the anti-object\nannihilate and the annihilation cross section is given by the geometrical area\nof the anti-object, that is \u03c3 = 4\u03c0R2 . The gamma ray luminosity of such a\ncompact anti-object is\n\u0012\n\u00132 \u0010\nR\nnp \u0011 \u0010 v \u0011\nL\u03b3 \u2248 1027\nerg/s ,\n(2)\nR\u2299\ncm\u22123\n10\u22123\nwhere R\u2299 \u223c 7 * 1010 cm is the Solar radius and np v is the proton flux. With\nthis luminosity, a solar mass anti-star would have the life time of the order\nof 1027 s (considering only matter\u2013antimatter annihilation), if all the factors\nin Eq. (2) are of order unity. For an anti-star in the galactic disc, the \u03b3 flux\nobservable on the Earth would be\n\u0010 R \u00112 \u0010 1 pc \u00112\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 .\n(3)\n\u03c6Earth \u223c 10\u22127\nR\u2299\nd\n\nwhere d is the distance of the anti-star from the Earth. Such a flux should be\ncompared with the point source sensitivity of EGRET [16], at the level of 10\u22127\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 for E\u03b3 > 100 MeV, and of the near-future GLAST [17],\nwhich should be about two order of magnitude better, i.e. \u223c 10\u22129 photons\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . So, anti-stars should be quite close to us in order to be detectable\npoint-like sources and their observation would result difficult if they were very\ncompact objects, as e.g. anti-neutron stars. On the other hand, if such an antistar lived in the galactic center, where np \u226b 1/cm3 , its luminosity would be\nlarger. Anomalously bright lines of 0.5 MeV are observed recently in the galactic center [18], galactic bulge [19] and possibly even in the halo [20]. Though an\nexcess of slow positrons is explained in a conventional way as a result of their\ncreation by light dark matter particles, such a suggestion is rather unnatural,\nbecause it requires a fine-tuning of the mass of the dark matter particle and\nthe electron mass. More natural explanation is the origin of these positrons\nfrom primordial antimatter objects.\nThe existence of primordial antimatter in the Galaxy would increase the\ngalactic diffuse gamma ray background as well. Standard theoretical predictions and observational data agree on a galactic production rate of \u03b3 in the\nenergy range E\u03b3 > 100 MeV [9]\n43 \u22121\n\u0393tot\ns .\n\u03b3 \u223c 10\n\n(4)\n\nRequiring that annihilation processes on anti-stars surface cannot produce more\nthan 10% of the standard galactic production rate (4), we obtain the following\nbound on the present number of anti-stars\n\u0010 R \u00112\n\u2299\n,\n(5)\nNS\u0304 . 1012\nR\n\n\fC. Bambi\n\nSearch for primordial antimatter\n\n133\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we assumed that all the anti-stars have the same radius\nR. However the constraint is not very strong: for solar type anti-stars, their\nnumber cannot exceed the one of ordinary stars!\nLet us now consider the annihilation of antimatter from the anti-stellar\nwind with protons in the interstellar medium. Since the number of antiprotons\nreached a stationary value, the production rate of 100 MeV \u03b3 in the Galaxy\nhas to be proportional to NS\u0304 . The luminosity of the Galaxy in 100 MeV \u03b3\nrays from anti-stellar wind would be LS\u0304 \u223c 1044 W NS\u0304 /NS erg/s, where W is\nthe anti-stellar wind to solar wind flux ratio. Since from Eq. (4) we find that\nthe total Galaxy luminosity in 100 MeV \u03b3 is Ltot\n\u223c 1039 erg/s, the related\n\u03b3\nbound on the anti-star to star number ratio is NS\u0304 /NS . 10\u22126 W \u22121 , always\nassuming that the contribution from new physics cannot exceed 10% of Ltot\n\u03b3 .\nA similar restriction can also be obtained from the 0.511 MeV line created by\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation with positrons from the anti-stellar wind.\nOn the other hand, if anti-stars were formed in the very early universe in\nthe regions with a high antimatter density [10], such primordial stars would\nmost probably be compact ones, like white dwarfs or neutron stars. The stellar\nwind in this case would be much smaller that the solar one, W \u226a 1. Their\nluminosity from the annihilation on the surface should be very low, because\nof their small radius R, and their number in the Galaxy may be even larger\nthan the number of the usual stars. This possibility is not excluded by the\nprevious bounds. Such compact dark stars could make a noticeable part of the\ncosmological dark matter.\n2.2 Direct detection\nIt is common belief that the abundances of most elements in the cosmic rays\nreflect relative abundances in the Galaxy. Hence, as the simplest working\nhypothesis we can assume that the antimatter\u2013matter ratio in cosmic rays is\nmore or less equal to the anti-star\u2013star ratio NS\u0304 /NS , at least if the anti-stars\nare of the same kind as the stars in the Galaxy.\nAs for antiprotons and positrons, they cannot be direct indicators for the\nexistence of primordial antimatter, because they can be produced in many\nastrophysical processes. For example, the observed p\u0304/p ratio is at the level of\n10\u22124 and is compatible with theoretical predictions for p\u0304 production by the\nhigh energy cosmic ray collisions with the interstellar medium. A possible\ncontribution of p\u0304 from primordial lumps of antimatter is not more than about\n10% of the total observed p\u0304 flux, so NS\u0304 /NS . 10\u22125 and the number of antistars NS\u0304 has to be no more than 106 , since the number of ordinary stars in the\nGalaxy is NS \u223c 1011 .\nOn the other hand, the possibility of producing heavier anti-nuclei (such\nas anti-helium) in cosmic ray collisions is completely negligible and a possible\nfuture detection of the latter would be a clear signature of antimatter objects.\n\n\f134\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nAt present there exists an upper limit on the anti-helium to helium ratio in\ncosmic rays, at the level of 10\u22126 [21], leading to the constraint NS\u0304 . 105 . Such\nan upper limit can probably be lowered by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude in a\nnear future, thanks to AMS [22] and PAMELA [23] space missions. I would\nlike to stress that here we are not assuming that these possible anti-helium\nnuclei were produced by nuclear fusion inside anti-stars, but that original antihelium abundance inside anti-stars is roughly equal to the helium abundance\ninside ordinary stars. This is certainly a conservative picture, since anti-stars\nwere formed in high density regions of the early universe, where the primordial\nnucleosynthesis produced much more anti-helium and heavier anti-nuclei [15].\nOn the other hand, if anti-stars were compact ones from the very beginning,\nthe stellar wind from them and the shortage of anti-supernova events would\nspread much less anti-helium than the normal stars.\n2.3 More exotic events\nThe presence of anti-stars in the Galaxy could lead to extraordinary events of\nstar\u2013anti-star annihilation. As a matter of fact, the radiation pressure produced\nin the collision prevents their total destruction. Still the released energy can\nbe huge.\nThe most spectacular phenomenon is a collision between a star and an\nanti-star with similar masses M . A simple estimate of the amount of the\nannihilated matter in such a collision is mann \u223c M v 2 [9], where v is the typical\nvalue of the relative velocity and is about 10\u22123 . The total energy release\nwould be E \u223c 1048 erg(M/M\u2299 )(v/10\u22123 )2 . Most probably the radiation would\nbe emitted in a narrow disk along the boundary of the colliding stars. The\ncollision time is tcoll \u223c R and for the solar type star this time is about 3 s. The\nenergy of the radiation should be noticeably smaller than 100 MeV, because\nthe radiation should degrade in the process of forcing the star bounce. This\nmakes this collision similar to gamma bursts, but unfortunately some other\nfeatures\n\u221a do not fit so well: the released energy should be much larger, about\n1053 v erg and it is difficult to explain the features of the afterglow.\n3\n\nConclusion\n\nUnfortunately there are no true conclusions because we are unable to make\nclear predictions. However this is the problem of all the baryogenesis models:\nthe physics responsible for the matter\u2013antimatter asymmetry in the universe is\nunknown and common approaches are based on the construction and investigation of toy-models which contain free parameters that we can only partially\nconstrain with the observed asymmetry (1). Moreover, most baryogenesis scenarios are based on physics at very high energy, which will be hardly tested in\na near future by man-made colliders. On the other hand, if we are lucky and\n\n\fC. Bambi\n\nSearch for primordial antimatter\n\n135\n\nable to get evidences of the existence of primordial antimatter object, the latter\nwill tell us much interesting information on high energy physics (CP violation,\nB violation, etc.) and, maybe, even on cosmological open questions such as the\nnature of dark matter.\nGamma rays from pp\u0304 annihilation may be observable with future or even\nwith existing \u03b3-telescopes. Quite promising for discovery of cosmic antimatter\nare point-like sources of gamma radiation; the problem is to identify a source\nwhich is suspicious to consist of antimatter. The 100 MeV gamma ray background does not have pronounced features which would unambiguously tell\nthat the photons came from the annihilation of antimatter. The photons produced as a result of pp\u0304 annihilation would have a well known spectrum but it\nmay be difficult to establish a small variation of the conventional spectrum due\nto such photons. In contrast, the 0.511 MeV line must originate from e+ e\u2212\nannihilation and it is tempting to conclude that the observed excessive signal\nfrom the Galaxy and, especially, from the galactic bulge comes from astronomical antimatter objects. If an anti-star happens to be in the galactic center,\nits luminosity from the surface annihilation of the background matter should\nbe strongly enhanced due to the much larger density of the interstellar matter\nthere. So the search of the antimatter signatures in the direction of the center\nis quite promising. There is also a non-negligible chance to detect cosmic antinuclei and not only light anti-helium but also much heavier ones, especially if\nanti-stars became early supernovae.\nReferences\n[1] G.

Moiseev a , Edward A. Baltz b , J.F. Ormes c , and L.G.\nTitarchuk d\non behalf of the GLAST LAT Collaboration\na\n\nCRESST and Astroparticle Physics Laboratory at NASA/GSFC,\nGreenbelt, USA\nb\nc\n\nKIPAC, Menlo Park, USA\n\nUniversity of Denver, Denver, USA\nd\n\nNRL, Washington, USA\n\nAbstract\nWe present here the prospects for the GLAST Large Area Telescope\n(LAT) detection of the signature of the lightest Kaluza-Klein particle\n(LKP). It decays by direct annihilation into electron-positron pairs that\nmay be detectable in the high energy electron flux. We discuss the LAT\ncapability for detecting the high energy (20 GeV - 1 TeV) cosmic ray\nelectron flux and we analyze the LAT sensitivity to detect LKP-produced\nelectrons for various particle masses. We include an analysis of the diffusive propagation of the electrons in the galaxy.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe nature of dark matter and dark energy is one of the most exciting and critical problems in modern astrophysics. A number of theoretical models predict\nthe existence of dark matter in different forms; so the experimental detection\n137\n\n\f138\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nwill be crucial. A large number of experiments are ongoing and planned to\ndetect dark matter, directly and indirectly, both at accelerators and in space,\nwhere they search for dark matter signatures in cosmic radiation (see [1] and\nreferences therein). In this paper we explore the capability of GLAST Large\nArea Telescope (LAT), scheduled for launch in the beginning of 2008, to detect\nthe signature of dark matter in the high energy cosmic ray electron flux. We\nhave previously demonstrated that LAT will be a powerful detector of cosmic\nray electrons, and will provide measurement of their flux with high statistical\nconfidence [2]. We should mention that LAT is not designed to distinguish\nelectrons from positrons, so we refer to their sum as electrons for simplicity.\nLAT will detect \u2248 107 electrons per year above 20 GeV with the energy resolution 5-20%. Such good statistics permits detection of spectral features, among\nwhich could be ones caused by exotic sources such as Kaluza-Klein particles\nwhich manifest higher spatial dimensions. Baltz and Hooper [1] investigated\nthe possibility of the annihilation of the Lightest Kaluza-Klein Particles (LKP),\nwhich can be a stable and viable dark matter candidate, directly into electronpositron pairs. They estimated that electron-positron pairs are produced in\napproximately 20% of the annihilation cases, which makes the observations\nviable within the model assumptions.\nThere are some indications of spectral features in the electron spectrum\nobserved by ATIC [3] and PPB-BETS [4] around 300-500 GeV, as well as in\nthe positron spectrum measured by HEAT [5], encouraging us for measurements\nwith the LAT.\n2\n\nLAT Capability to detect cosmic ray electrons\n\nIt was demosnstrated earlier that the LAT can efficiently detect cosmic ray\nelectrons [2]. Being a gamma-ray telescope, it intrinsically is an electron spectrometer. The main problem is to separate the electrons from all other species,\nmainly protons. In order to keep the hadron contamination in the detected electron flux under 10%, the hadron-electron separation power must be 103 \u2212 104 .\nAt very high energy (above a few TeV) the diffuse gamma-radiation could be a\npotential background, but it will be effectively eliminated by the LAT AntiCoincidence Detector. LAT's onboard trigger accepts all events with the detected\nenergy above \u2248 20 GeV, which is very important in order to have unbiased\ndata sample. We took advantage of this LAT feature and explored the instrument sensitivity in the energy range above 20 GeV. It is also good to mention\nthat there should be no problem with albedo and geomagnetic variation in this\nenergy range.\nWe have developed a set of analysis cuts that select electrons and applied\nthem to simulated LAT data. The approach was based on using the difference in\nthe shower development between hadron-initiated and electron-initiated events.\n\n\fA. Moiseev et al.\n\nSearch for Kaluza-Klein Dark Matter by LAT\n\n139\n\nIn order to obtain the instrument response function for electrons we simulated\nthe electron spectrum incident on LAT and applied our selections. In the energy\nrange from 20 GeV to 1 TeV the effective geometric factor (for electrons) after\napplying our cuts is 0.2 \u2212 2 m2 sr and energy resolution is 5-20% depending\non the energy. We also applied the selections to the simulated cosmic ray flux\n(LAT background flux is used, see [6]) and determined the residual hadron\ncontamination to be \u2248 3% of the remaining electron flux.\nIn order to test the approach, we run an independent simulation of the incident flux and used the response function obtained to reconstruct the spectrum.\nFor the simulation of the electron flux we used the diffusion equation solution\ngiven in [7]. Fig.1 shows our spectrum reconstruction for the simulated electron flux collected during 1 year of LAT observations. The flux originated from\nan \"hypothetical\" single burst-like source, 2 \u00d7 105 years old, at a distance of\n100 pc. The diffusion coefficient D was assumed to be energy dependent as\n0.6\nD = D0 (1 + E/E0 ) with D0 = 1028 cm2 s\u22121 . The expected spectral cutoff\nfor this model is \u2248 1.2 TeV. With the demonstrated precision in the spectrum\nreconstruction we should be able to recognize the specific features which can\nbe associated with dark matter.\nE3 \u00d7 Flux, arbitrary units\n\n1 year of observation\n\n102\n\nSimulated Flux\nDetected Flux\nReconstructed Flux\n30 40 50\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\nEnergy, GeV\n\nFigure 1: Simulated electron flux reconstruction for LAT\n\n3\n\nDiffusive propagation of the LKP signal\n\nNow we want to include the contribution from the LKP annihilation into the\nelectron flux, and see how it can be detected by the LAT. We consider this contribution as a continuous injection from a single point source of monoenergetic\nelectrons, assuming dark matter clumpiness, and determine the effect of their\npropagation through space to the Earth. After that we will test LAT response\n\n\f140\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nto such a spectrum, varying the source parameters LKP mass and distance.\nWe treat the propagation of electrons using the stationary diffusion equation\nwhich in the spherical symmetric case is presented as\n\u2202\nD \u2202 2 \u2202f\nr\n+\n(P f ) = Q\n2\nr \u2202r \u2202r\n\u2202\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nwhere f (r, \u03b3) is a distribution of electron number over \u03b3 = E/me c2 and radius\nr at time t.\nWe assume that the continuous energy loss is dictated by synchrotron and\ninverse Compton losess\n\u2212d\u03b3/dt = P (\u03b3) = p2 \u03b3 2\nwhere\np2 = 5.2 \u00d7 10\u221220\n\nw0\ns\u22121\n1eV/cm3\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nand \u03c90 \u2243 1 eV/cm3 (see [7] for the propagation details)\nWe choose the energy-dependent diffusion coefficient in the form\nD(\u03b3) = D0 (1 + \u03b3/\u03b3g )\u03b7 cm2 s\u22121\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b3g and D0 are model parameters.\nWe derive the general solution of Eq.

There will be a superposition\nof contributions from dark matter clumps at different distances, which could\nreveal themselves as bumps in the spectrum, but the closest clump should\ndetermine the edge in the spectrum which should be clearly seen.\n4\n\nProspects for LAT to observe LKP\n\nOur analysis of the LAT capability for detection of electrons demonstrated the\nlow residual hadron contamination in the resulting electron flux (< 3%, see\n\n\f142\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nSection 2). The contamination from gamma-radiation will also be negligible,\nso the dominant background in the search for LKP signature will consist of\nonly \"conventional\" electron flux. Now we can apply the LAT capability for\nelectron detection to one of the dark matter models, using the scenario given\nin [1] as an example. The LKP annihilation will be seen as a line (edge) in the\n\u22126\nelectron spectrum of magnitude proportional to mLKP\nQline (mLKP )\ndNe\n=\n\u03b8(mLKP \u2212 Ee )\ndEe\nb(Ee )\n\u00132 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u03c10\n\u03b8(mLKP \u2212 Ee ) \u223c m\u22126\n\u223c h\u03c3vi\nLKP\nmLKP\nEe2\n\n(12)\n\nFlux JE3, m-2s-1sr-1GeV2\n\nwhere h\u03c3vi is the total annihilation cross section of LKP, and Qline is the rate\nof electron and positron injection from direct LKP annihilation.\nUsing the numbers from [1]: boost factor B = 5 and \u03c1local = 0.4 GeV cm3 ,\nthe magnitude of the signal after propagation is estimated as\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndNe\n9.5 \u00d7 108\n\u2248 6\nm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV\u22121 .\n(13)\ndEe\nmLKP [GeV]\n\nObserved electron flux\n\n100\n\n10\n\nLKP annihilation\n1\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600 700 800\n\nElectron Energy (LKP mass), GeV\n\nFigure 3: Expected electron flux from LKP annihilation, along with the observed electron flux\nFig.3 shows the expected signal from LKP vs. the mLKP plotted along\nwith the \"conventional\" electron flux for the comparison. Of course, even in\nthis optimistic model, the background dominates over the signal, but we now\ndetermine what will be the LAT sensitivity. Fig.4 shows the significance of\nLKP detection in the LAT-detected electron flux in one year of ovservation,\nand the observation time needed to detect LKP feature with 5\u03c3 confidence for a\nsource at 100 pc.

Taking into account\nthat for thermal freeze-out, LKP mass in the range 600-700 GeV is preferred,\nthe feasible window for LKP mass in the LAT search is rather narrow.\nNow we illustrate our analysis by adding the signal from LKP (mass 300\nGeV), from a single clump at a distantce of 100 pc, to the \"conventional\"\nelectron flux shown in Fig.1, using the solution obtained in Section 3. The\nresult is shown in Fig.6, with a clear signature of presence of a monoenergetic\ncomponent. This is a very favorable situation, but to some extent consistent\nwith references [3] and [4].\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nWe analyzed the capability of the LAT to detect high energy cosmic ray electrons and applied it to the model of LKP direct annihilation into electronpositron pairs. Using the estimates for this model as given in [1] as an example\nto demonstrate the detection feasibility, we estimated that within this model,\nthe LAT will be able to recognize the LKP-caused spectral edge in the electron spectrum up to a LKP mass of 600-700 GeV. The results obtained can\nbe applied to any dark matter model where electrons are produced in order to\nestimate the LAT sensitivity. The important feature is that the dominating\nbackground in these measurements will be only the \"conventional\" electron\nflux.\nWe want to thank all LAT team members, and especially the members\nof LAT Dark Matter Science Working Group for their support and valuable\nsuggestions.

The PMT camera is mounted at a\ndistance of 17 m from the mirror and consists of 576 PMTs, resulting in a field\nof view of 3.5\u25e6 .\nThe main goal of the MAGIC design was to reach low energy threshold while\nkeeping the total weight as low as possible to allow fast rotation. To reach this,\nan Active Mirror Control system has been implemented to correct for deformations of the dish under varying gravitational load, camera sagging and other\neffects.

Vitale.\n2.1 The Crab Nebula\nFigure 1 (right) shows the spectral energy density distribution of the Crab Nebula [6] as measured by MAGIC, together with results from other experiments.\nPhotons above 60 GeV are detected.\n2.2 MAGIC J0616+225\nThe detection of a new source of very high energy \u03b3-ray emission located close\nto the Galactic Plane, MAGIC J0616+225, which is spatially consistent with\nSNR IC 443, has been recently reported [7]. The statistical significance is 5.7\nsigma in the 2006/07 data. The sky map of \u03b3-ray candidate events (background\nsubtracted) in the direction of MAGIC J0616+225 for an energy threshold of\nabout 150 GeV in galactic coordinates is shown in Figure 2 (left). Overlayed\nare the multiwavelenght emission contours from other experiments.\n2.3 Cignus X-1\nObservations were performed in very high energy band (VHE, E\u03b3 \u2265 100 GeV)\nof the black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1, for a total of 40 hours between\nJune and November 2006. Evidence for a signal at 4.0 standard deviations (\u03c3)\nsignificance level was obtained for 154 minutes effective on-time on September\n24, coinciding with an X-ray flare seen by satellites [8].\n2.4 Cassiopeia A\nThe shell-type supernova remnant Cassiopeia A was observed between July\n2006 and January 2007 for a total time of 47 hours. The source was detected above an energy of 250 GeV with a significance of 5.3 \u03c3 and a photon flux above 1 TeV of (7.3\u00b10.7stat \u00b12.2sys ) \u00d7 10\u221213 cm\u22122 s\u22121 .

The source is point-like within the angular resolution\nof the telescope [9].\n3\n\nRecent Results: extragalactic sources\n\nMAGIC detected up to now (July 2007) 9 extragalactic sources and all of\nthem are well-established Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).

Here we will highlight on the most recent\nresults.\n3.1 Mkn501 flare\nTogether with Mkn 421, Mkn 501 is one of the most studied VHE sources. It\nwas observed with MAGIC between June and July 2005 [11].\nWe will focus here on the flare which was detected by MAGIC during the\nJune/July '05 observation. In Figure 3 (left) the light curve for the night July\n9 separated in different energy bands is shown. An unprecedented doubling\ntime as short as less then 4 minutes was detected. The rapid increase in the\nflux level was accompanied by a hardening of the differential spectrum.\nAn energy dependent time delay of the flare peak emission can result from\nthe dynamics of the source, such as gradual electron acceleration in the emitting\nplasma. A somewhat more speculative issue that blazar emission permits to\nexplore is related to non-conventional physics, such as a violation induced in the\nLorentz-Poincar\u00e9 symmetry. The time analysis of the Mkn501 flare is ongoing.\n3.2 BLLac\nBL Lacertae is the historical prototype of a class of powerful \u03b3-ray emitters:\nthe \"BL Lac objects\"[21].

Right: SED for BL\nLacertae.\nmillimeter to optical band, the objects are classified as \"Low-frequency peaked\nBL Lacs\" (LBLs); if it is in the UV to X-ray band, they are referred at as\n\"High-frequency peaked BL Lacs\" (HBLs) [22, 23].\nThe Crimean Observatory claimed a detection at a 7.2\u03c3 level [24], but\nHEGRA could not detect any significant signal during the same period, obtaining only an upper limit [25], which contradicted the claim.\nBL Lacertae was observed for 22 hours from August to December 2005\n[15]. The observation showed at a level of 5.1\u03c3 a new VHE source of flux\n3% CU above 200 GeV. The spectrum is compatible with a pure power law\nof index 3.6 \u00b1 0.5. The SED is shown in Figure 3 (right) together with the\nresults from other experiments. No significant variations of the VHE flux were\ndetected. The source was also observed from July to September 2006 for 26\nhours without any detection. There is a remarkable agreement of the observed\ntrend with the optical activity of the source, that, together with the discovery\nof Mkn 180, reinforces the idea of a connection between optical activity and\nincreased VHE emission.\nBL Lac is the first member of LBL ever detected to emit in the VHE region.\nGiven the very hard spectrum of the source, in agreement with LBL modelling,\nthe low energy of MAGIC was necessary for its discovery.\n3.3 1ES1011+496\nVery recently we reported on the discovery of VHE \u03b3-ray emission from the BL\nLacertae object 1ES 1011+496. The observation was triggered by an optical\noutburst in March 2007 and the source was observed with the MAGIC telescope\n\n\f150\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\ndifferential flux, dN/dE [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1]\n\nMAGIC, 1ES1011+496\n1ES1011+496, measured\nPower law fit to data\n1ES1011+496, deabsorbed\n\n-8\n\n10\n\nCrab Nebula spectrum\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n-10\n\n10\n\n10-11\n\npower law fit:\n-\u0393\nE\n200GeV\n-10\nN0 = (2.0 \u00b1 0.1)\u00d710 [TeV-1 cm-2 s-1]\n\ndN/dE = N0\n10-12\n\n\u0393 = 4.0 \u00b1 0.5\n-13\n\n10\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\n400 500\n\n1000\nEnergy, E [GeV]\n\nFigure 4: The measured spectrum for 1ES1011 (black filled circles), the powerlaw fit to the data (solid line), the deabsorbed spectrum (brown open circles),\nand the fit to the deabsorbed spectrum (dashed brown line).\nfrom March to May 2007. Observing for 18.7 hours we find an excess of 6.2 \u03c3\nwith an integrated flux above 200 GeV of (1.58\u00b10.32) * 10\u221211 photons cm\u22122\ns\u22121 . The energy spectrum of 1ES 1011+496 is shown in Fig. 4. It is well\napproximated by a power law with spectral index of 3.3 \u00b1 0.7 after correction\nfor EBL absorption. The redshift of 1ES 1011+496 has been detected, based\non an optical spectrum that reveals the absorption lines of the host galaxy. The\nredshift of z = 0.212 makes 1ES 1011+496 the most distant source observed to\nemit VHE \u03b3-rays up to date.\n4\n\nConclusion and Outlook\n\nThe performance of the MAGIC telescope complied with the design specifications. Since the end of commissioning, two full years of physics campaign\nfollowed and the data were almost completely analysed. MAGIC detected a\ntotal of eight galactic and nine extragalactic sources, discovering new populations and new features. Most of the new sources could be actually discovered\nbecause of the low energy threshold of MAGIC and its good sensitivity even\nbelow 100 GeV. Its good sensitivity, mainly due to the huge effective area common to all detectors exploiting the IACT, allowed also to resolve short term\nflux variability down to 2 minutes.\nThe construction of a second telescope, MAGIC II, close to the original\n\n\fB. De Lotto\n\nMAGIC Results and Perspectives\n\n151\n\none, has started. It incorporates some minor modifications suggested by the\nexperience of running MAGIC for the last three years, as well as some basic\nchanges.\nLarger (1 m2 surface) and lighter mirrors will be implemented, under the\nresponsibility of the Italian INFN and INAF.\nA huge improvement of the Data Acquisition System is foreseen: a new\n2GHz sampler, based on a custom chip named Domino, is foreseen to reduce\nthe Night Sky Background contribution on the signal. The heat dissipation\nrequired by standard FADC is causing troubles and the new design will reduce\nit by two orders of magnitude. The new readout system is also responsibility\nof the INFN.\nA new camera design with a total number of channels of \u223c 1000 is foreseen;\na big improvement is expected by high quantum efficiency devices such as HPDs\nand and SiPMs.\nMAGIC II is expected to be ready by September 2008, when stereo observations will be operational, allowing an increase in the sensitivity by at least a\nfactor 2, and other improvements in the energy and direction reconstruction.\nWith the advent of MAGIC II, VHE \u03b3-ray astrophysics will reach down a\nlevel of 1% CU. In the meanwhile, the AGILE results should come and GLAST\nshould become fully operational, closing the current observational gap between\n\u223c 1 and 60 GeV and extending observations of the electromagnetic radiation,\nwithout solution of continuity, up to almost 100 TeV.\nReferences\n[1] C.

The low energy threshold and the good sensitivity\nmake MAGIC telescope well-suited for dark matter hunting in astronomical targets.\nIn this proceeding, after a brief introduction of the physics framework\nand a discussion on the possible interesting targets, a strategy for the\nobservation will be given for the MAGIC telescope together with an outlook on the next future of the experiment.\n\n153\n\n\f154\n1\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nObservation of dark matter with atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes\n\nIn the context of a \u039bCDM scenario for the Universe, the WMAP experiment\nrecently allowed to put strong constraints on a large number of parameters, including the total abundance of relic dark matter (DM) around \u03a9DM = 0.24 [1].\nThe \u039bCDM scenario favours a WIMP-like DM particle, i.e. a weak and gravitational interacting particle but neutral for color and charge. A number of\ntheoretical particles satisfies the requirements of the WMAP constraints together with other experimental limits (see [2] for a detailed discussion and\nreferences therein). Most of these candidates foresees a very outstanding new\nphysics. We discuss here two very promising candidates: the neutralino particle (\u03c7) inside the mSUGRA extension of the Standard Model [2], and the light\nKaluza particle (LKP) in multi-dimensional theories [3].\nBoth particles have decay channels that include gamma-rays in their final state\nof emission, both in continuous and line emissions, even if the estimation of the\nbranching ratios depends on parameters which varies among different models.\nIn the case of neutralino in the mSUGRA framework, the uncertainties relies\non 4 continuous and 1 discrete parameters: The mixing angle tan\u03b2 which is the\nratio of the vacuum expectation value for the two Higgs bosons constituting\nthe neutralino, the universal trilinear mass term A0 , the universal scalar and\ngaugino masses m0 and m1/2 respectively and the sign of the Higgsino mass\n\u03bc. Different realizations for the neutralino are usually plotted in a m1/2 \u2212 m0\nbidimensional grid for different values of tan \u03b2 (see Fig. 1). Currently, the\ngaugino \u2212 like neutralino is best preferred, with mass of few hundreds GeV,\nwhere 45 GeV is the mass lower limit due to accelerator experiments and an upper limits can be placed as several TeV. Once the set of parameters is defined,\nthe branching ratios are a consequence. Usually the annihilation of neutralinos,\nwhich is a Majorana particle, leads to the production of all standard models\nparticles, and in particular quarks b b\u0304, W and Z bosons, and \u03c4 leptons. Also a\ndirect annihilation into two gammas is possible, even if loop-suppressed.\nThe LKP particle B (1) is the first Kaluza-Klein excitation of the photon.\nAlso this particles decay into standard particles, with a preference for the\nleptonic channel and the quark channel. Also decay into neutrinos and Higgs\nbosons are foreseen. A tentative mass range can be fixed between 400 GeV and\n1200 GeV.\nPresent dark matter searches are three-fold: direct detection through energy\nrecoil in target materials where DM elastically scatters, direct production at\naccelerators, and indirect detection through products of the annihilation of DM\nwhich takes place at cosmic places. In this latter case one can use anti-particles,\nneutrino, protons and deuterons, and of course gamma-rays as tracers of the\nreaction.\n\n\fM.

The neutralino should be found in the shaded yellow and shaded\nblue region. Figure from [4].\n1.1 Spectrum and fluxes from annihilations of DM\nThe spectrum of gamma-rays from annihilation of DM particles depends on\nthe particle physics characteristics of the particle and its mass; nevertheless\nsome basic features have generality: a) gammas from the fermionic channels\nhave spectrum with slope close to \u22121.5, b) the cut-off in the LKP case is\nsteeper than the exponential cut-off of the neutralino case, and if observed can\nconstitute a discriminating factor between the two particles, c) a bump close to\nthe cut-off can be found with final state radiation when W particles are created\nand d) all the spectrum look similar when the DM mass increases.\nThe gamma-rays flux for a given gamma spectrum dN\u03b3 /dE originating from\nannihilation regions is:\n\u03c3v 1 dN\u03b3 (E)\nd\u03a6(E)\n=\ndE\n2m2\u03c7 d2 dE\n\nZ\n\n\u03c12 (r) r2 dr\n\n(1)\n\nrcut\n\nwhere \u03c3v is the DM annihilation cross section times relative velocity, d is\nthe object distance, dN/dE is the gamma spectrum and \u03c1(r) the DM density\nprofile.\nThe flux is factorized in a particle physics factor, and an astrophysical factor\nwhich described the DM profile around the target. Both factor play an important role and their interplay acts in a way that the uncertainties in the flux\nestimations can be of several orders of magnitude, which make strategies for\nobservation very hard to define for most scenarios. We will show in Sec. 3.3\nthat in some cases the situation can be slightly improved.\n\n\f156\n2\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nDark Matter searches with IACTs\n\nThe observation of the sky with IACTs happens through the detection of very\nhuge showers of particles initiated by VHE cosmic particles impinging the Earth\natmosphere. As a shower develops in the atmosphere, a larger and larger\nnumber of charged particles is produced, each having enough energy to boost\nthe Cherenkov emission when the primary particle energy exceed the GeV.\nThe shower creates then a very fast (\u223c 2 ns) flash of blue-UV light which is\ncollected and focussed onto a pixellated camera. An off-line analysis allows to\nreconstruct the primary particle characteristics (energy, direction, type) on the\nbasis of the image recorded in the camera, which is typically an ellipse pointing\nto the center.\nThe MAGIC telescope [5] is located at the Canary island of La Palma, at an\naltitude of 2,200 m.asl. Its world largest dish with a diameter of 17 m (236 m2\narea) allows a lower energy threshold of 60 GeV at zenith, and a sensitivity of\nless than 2.5% of Crab in 50 hours. Its energy range then overlaps with the\nenergy range of the two DM candidates above described, making the telescope\nsuited for their search. In case the signal from DM region in the sky is strong\nenough, IACTs will be able to detect DM, and through spectral analysis a clear\nsign of a particular DM candidate could be in turn obtained.\n3\n\nAnnihilation sites of interest for the MAGIC telescopes\n\nIt is commonly believed that the entire Universe is pervaded by the presence\nof DM. Being gravitationally active, regions with over-densities are expected.\nMost of the dark matter is nevertheless concentrated in spherical halos around\nthe galaxies. Nevertheless, as the annihilation rate depends on the square of the\ndensity \u0393 \u223c \u03c12DM (see Eq. 1), the search can only be performed in \"amplification\nsites\" where DM concentrates. In the following sections, the interesting places\nfor the MAGIC telescope are discussed.\n3.1 The Milky Way centre\nThe centre of most galaxies is supposed to host a Super Massive Black Hole\n(SMBH) of the order of 109 M\u2299 . The SMBH is surrounded by a dense torus\nof accreting material, optically blind, and in some cases two jets of VHE particles and radiation come out from the SMBH in direction perpendicular to\nthe thorus itself. The DM, driven by gravitational forces, accrete around the\nGCs and its effect can be clearly observed on the motion of stars around it,\nthe gravitational lensing and other effects. The DM profile around the GC\nis almost well-known at distances beyond some kpc from the centre, where it\nis expected to be a power-law Navarro-Frenck-White (NFW) profile with very\nflat slope \u22123 [7]. In the inner region, namely the inner parsecs, experimental\n\n\fM. Doro et al.\n\nDark Matter Searches with the MAGIC Telescope\n\n157\n\nevidences and theorical models disagree in discriminating between core models,\nthat means profile foreseeing a central plateau, and cusp models, which foresee\nthe presence of a clump of slope between 0.5 and 1.5. The former case seems\nsupported by experimental observations [8, 9], while the second one comes out\nfrom any N-body simulations.\nThe observation of the MW GC was performed by MAGIC in the period 200406 [6], together with other IACTs. A total of 24 hours of observation were\ncarried on at large zenith angle, above 58 deg. The GC was observed with a\nsignificance of 7.3 sigma and 257 excess events.\nThe GC showed a steady emission within the observation time, with a pure\npower-law spectrum without cut-off ranging from 400 GeV to 20 TeV, with a\nslope of \u22122.2 \u00b1 0.2, see Fig. 2.\n\nFigure 2: Gamma-ray spectrum of gamma\u2013rays from the observation of GC\nwith the MAGIC telescope during 2004-06.\nThe observed signal is a typical sign of an astrophysical emitter. In fact,\nlocated at the GC are two known emitters, namely the SMBH SgrA* and the\nSNR SgrA East, from where probably the observed signal comes from. This\nresult anyhow does not indicate the absence of DM in the GC, but states\nthat even if it exists, it is overcome by the stronger background astrophysical\nemission. Even if it exists, the DM signal cannot be then more than few\npercents of the total observed signal.\n\n\f158\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n3.2 Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies\nA number of galaxies in the Universe is observed with a very low brightness\ncompared to their mass content. The usual parameter for comparison is the\nratio of there parameters in terms of the same units for the Sun M\u2299 /L\u2299 .\nSome of these object can have M/L larger than a hundred or even a thousand\nM\u2299 /L\u2299 [10]. The common interpretation is that these objects are dominated\nby DM compared to barionic luminous matter or gas and dust.\nAmong these objects are the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), which are small\ngalaxies gravitationally bound to the Milky Way. Even if their identification is\nnot straightforward as they are dark objects, already a number of them were\nclearly identified.\nThe DM distribution around these objects follows similar ideas with respect\nto the GC, with a flat distribution outside the central region, and a cusped or\ncored profile in the center. Studies on the motion of the stars were performed\nfor some of these objects compatible with a core profile. A flux extimation is\nonce more subject to large uncertainties. Studies on the observability of the\nDraco dSph shows furthermore that with the given pointing accurancy (PSF)\nof the MAGIC telescope, around 0.1 deg, it is not possible to discriminate\nbetween the two profiles because the inner region is seen as point-like and then\nthe excess in the profile is smeared out, see Fig. 3 for details.\nMAGIC telescope observed the Draco dSph during 2005-2007 for a total of\nabout 15 hours without detecting any signal above the background from the\nregion. With the obtained upper limits on the flux emission it is still not\npossible to put serious constraints on the SUSY parameters space and more\nobservational time is required for this object. The results are currently under\npublication.\n3.3 IMBHs\nThe underlying theory expressed in this section can be found in Ref. [11]. A\ndifferent subject for DM observation raised the interest in the last few years.\nDuring the studies of the evolution of SMBHs which are believed to be present\nin the centre of most galaxies, one has to face the problem on how to create\nsuch huge objects within a very brief amount of time: in fact some SMBHs\nare observed in very young (1 Gyr) galaxy. A possible explanation resides in\nmajor event of merging of smaller seed black holes of intermediate mass (10105 M\u2299 ) in the early Universe. A large number of these objects can in fact be\nproduced either by collapse of first zero-metallicity Pop.3 stars (scenario I), or\nby collapse of giant molecular clouds (scenario II). Some of these objects could\nnot have suffered major mergings and could have remained wandering objects\nin the galactic halo. Due to the low local barion content, adiabatic growth\ncould be possible onto these objects so that the DM did have the possibility\n\n\fM. Doro et al.\n\nDark Matter Searches with the MAGIC Telescope\n\n159\n\nFigure 3: Convolution of cored and cuspy profiles with the MAGIC pointing\naccurancy for the Draco.\n\nto form a peaked enhancement around the central black hole, constituting\nthe so-called \"mini\u2013spike\". The mini-spikes are twice interesting: from one\nside, due to the very large density, the signal in gammas annihilation could\nbe very bright, brighter than the entire hosting galaxy itself. From the other\nside, the calculation of the flux is strongly dominated by the particle physics\nfactor, while the astrophysical factor, namely the profile of DM, plays a less\nimportant role, as to say that the evolution of the object was largely affected\nonly by the DM effective interaction. The dependence on the particle physics\n\u22129/7\nin the IMBH case is \u03a6 \u223c < \u03c3v >2/7 * m\u03c7 . According to the different\nevolution scenarios, a different number of these objects, ranging from 100-1000\nfor scenario I and II respectively, should be found in the galactic halo. In trying\nto figure out where IMBHs could be found, a search within the unidentified\nEGRET sources was performed. The EGRET experiment, onboard the CGRO\nsatellite, discovered around 270 sources, out of which more than a hundred are\nstill not recognized by other experiments. Some of them satisfies the IMBH\nmodel, being steady emitters, with spectral index as is expected by IMBH, with\nno counterpart at other wavelengths. MAGIC performed a selection between\nthese sources to select the best candidates at large galactic latitudes (> 20 deg)\nwhere no astrophysical emitters are expected so that the observation could be\nbackground\u2013free. Observations are orgoing and foreseen for the next future.\n\n\f160\n4\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nOutlook\n\nThe overlap between the DM candidates mass and the energy range to which\nIACT are currently sensitive make this technique suitable for DM observation.\nNevertheless flux estimation are subject to large uncertainties of the orders of\nmagnitude making observational plan hard to perform. The most interesting\nsubjects of interest are the dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way, where\na large amount of dark matter is expected. A promising target are the minispikes of dark matter around intermediate mass black holes in the galactic halo.\nWith the construction of a second clone telescope, the MAGIC overall performance will enhance in terms of pointing accurancy, background rejection and\nsensitivity due to the stereoscopic observation mode. The possibility to observe\nfainter sources with a better \"eye\" goes in the direction of an increased chance\nof observing a signal from annihilation of dark matter in the Universe.\nReferences\n[1] D.N.

Many\nclasses of sources were considered such as plerions, shell type supernova\nremnants, unidentified sources and also \u03b3 ray binaries. Here are reported\nthe investigations of Cassiopeia A, MAGIC J0616+225, the low energy\nstudy of Crab Nebula and the search for pulsar pulsed \u03b3 emission.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe MAGIC collaboration has built and operates the largest Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) currently in operation. The telescope and\nthe scientific program for the study of extra-galactic sources, gamma-ray bursts\nand dark matter are described in details elsewere in these proceedings.\nDuring the past years the VHE \u03b3 ray astronomy made major advances and\nthe detected sources went from 12 in 2003 to 71 in 2007, among which 51 are\ngalactic or unidentified (21).\nHere below some selected results of the MAGIC observation of galactic\nsources during cycle II are reported. Crab data are instead from cycle I. I\nfocused on sources related to shell type or plerionic supernova remnant, candidate multi-TeV accelerators of charged particles. Results on \u03b3 ray binaries,\nsuch as the evidence of \u03b3 ray excess from Cygnus X-1 or the deep study of LS\nI +61 303, and other studies could not be reported for shortage of space.\n161\n\n\f162\n2\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nCassiopeia A\n\nCassiopeia A is a shell type supernova remnant, bright in the radio [9],[27]\nand X ray [7],[14] bands. The remnant consists of a patchy and irregular\nshell with diameter of 4', at an extimated distance of 3.4 kpc. A compact\nobject was revealed with Chandra observations [21].The remnant results from\nthe youngest known galactic supernova (A.D.1680). The progentor was probably a 15 to 25 Msun Wolf-Rayet star [15],[28], and the SN shock might expand into the progenitor wind bubble. Cass a was detected by the HEGRA\nCherenkov Telescope System [1] with an exposure of 232 hours and a \u03b3 ray flux\nof (5.8\u00b11.2stat \u00b11.2sys ) 10\u221213 ph cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 1 TeV was reported (e.g. 3%\nof Crab flux). The spectral energy distribution was compatible with a power\nlaw with photon index of (-2.5\u00b10.4stat\u00b10.1sys ).\nCas A (23.385h,58.800\u25e6) was observed with MAGIC and an exposure of\n47 hours was available after quality data selection. The source is visible from\nthe MAGIC site above 29\u25e6 of zenith angle. Observations were performed also\nunder moderate moonlight illumination, which did not substantially reduce\nthe instrument performances. The data analysis was performed as reported in\ndetails in [3].\nAn excess of 157 \u03b3 ray events, with a significance of 5.2\u03c3 was detected\nfrom the source. A sky map of the emission (Fig.1) was built and the c.o.g.\nof the emission was found at RA = 23.386\u00b10.003stat\u00b10.001sys h, and DEC =\n58.81\u00b10.03stat\u00b10.02\u25e6sys , consistent with the remnant position and the HEGRA\nsource location. The X ray and radio diameter of Cas A (0.08\u25e6 ) are comparable\nwith the MAGIC angular resolution and no source extension was found. The\nsource differential energy spectrum (Fig.2) was obtained for \u03b3 rays above 250\nGeV up to 6 TeV, and is consistent with a power law with a photon index of\n(-2.4\u00b10.2stat \u00b10.2sys ). The differential flux is (1.0\u00b10.1stat \u00b10.3sys ) 10\u221212 TeV\u22121\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 at 1 TeV. The \u03c72 /d.o.f. of the fit was 2.83/3.\nThe MAGIC telescope detected the supernova remnant Cas A at level of\n5.2 \u03c3 and confirmed the previous discovery made by HEGRA. In the common\nenergy range, above 1 TeV the results of MAGIC and HEGRA are in agreement,\nfurthermore MAGIC measured the source energy spectrum down to 250 GeV.\nNo spectral departures from a power law were found. The Cas A detection\nprovides evidence of the acceleration of multi-TeV particle. Higher and lower\nenergy measurements are needed in order to discriminate among leptonic or\nadronic \u03b3 ray origin, as also a higher signal significance for such a weak source.\n3\n\nMAGIC J0616+225\n\nThe source MAGIC J0616+225 was discovered with the observations of the\nsupernova remnant IC 443. This remnant is of shell type, asymmetric and has\nan angular diameter of 45' at an estimated distance of 1.5 kpc [16].

The star indicates the pulsar CXOU\nJ061705.3+222127 and the black dot the 1720 MHz maser emission position.\nwas studied in the radio band at various wave-lengths [24],[13]. Maser emission\nat 1720 MHz was reported from four regions of the shell [12], among which the\nmost intense is in (l = -171.0, b = 2.9). The source was also well studied with X\nray observatories [8],[23] [10], [26], [17] and a pulsar, CXOU J61705.3+222127,\npossibly associated to the remnant, was discovered. An EGRET source (3EG\nJ0617+2238) was found to be coincident with the center of the shell [19]. Also\nfor this reason IC 443 was searched for TeV \u03b3 ray emission, but only upper\nlimits [20], [22] were reported, before the MAGIC observation.\nThe data analysis was performed as described in details in [4]. A smoothed\nsky map of the \u03b3 ray candidates was obtained (Fig.3). A \u03b3 ray excess is visible\nin RA=06h 16m 43s , DEC=+22\u25e6 31'48\". This excess has a significance of 5.7\u03c3.\nThe differential energy spectrum was calculated above 90GeV. It was fitted\nwith a power law with photon index of (-3.1\u00b10.3) and flux at 400 GeV of\n(1.0\u00b10.2) 10\u221211 TeV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (\u03c72 /d.o.f.= 1.1).\nMAGIC J0616+225 is at the edge of the radio and X ray shell and of the\nEGRET source. A region of 1720 MHz maser emission and a large amount of\nmolecular gas are instead co-located with the new discovered source. Therefore\nthe \u03b3 emission might originate from the interaction of particles accelerated in\nthe shell with nearby dense molecular clouds. The MAGIC source is displaced\nfrom the pulsar CXOU J061705.3+222127 as is seen in Fig.3. Then PWN\nemission is disfavoured.\n\n\fE2 \u00d7 dF/dE TeV m-2s-1\n\nVincenzo Vitale\n\n165\n\nGalactic Sources with MAGIC\n\n10-6\n\n-7\n\n10\n\nEGRET\nWhipple\nHEGRA\nCANGAROO\nCeleste\nStacee\nTibet\nH.E.S.S.\nAharonian et al.

It is the standard candle for the VHE \u03b3\nray astronomy also becouse of its large steady flux. The remanant originated\nby the galactic supernova of A.D. 1054. It is a plerion and is powered by\nthe millisecond pulsar PSR B0531+21. Despite the deep study of this source,\nimportant questions on the emission mechanism are still open, in particular for\nthe pulsar and the nebula at GeV energies and for the nebula at PeV energies.\nFor a more detailed introduction see [5]. The search for pulsed emission above\n10 GeV, is reported in the next section. These results are based on 19 hours\nof data taken between October and December 2005. The detailed discussion of\nthe analysis is in [5]\nThe differential energy spectrum of the source was measured down to 60\nGeV(Fig.4). This spectrum can be described with a curved power law dF\ndE\nE\n= A0 ( 300GeV\n)a+blog10(E/300GeV ) , where A0 = (6.0 \u00b1 0.2stat ) 10\u221210 TeV\u22121\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 , a = -2.31\u00b1 0.06stat and b = -0.26\u00b10.07stat. The \u03c72 /d.o.f. for the\ncurved power law fit is 8/7, for comparison a simple power law fit has \u03c72 /d.o.f.\n= 24/8 and yelds a photon index of (-2.48\u00b10.03stat\u00b10.2sys ). The spectral\nenergy distribution peak was found at 77\u00b147 GeV. No source extension and no\nflux variation within the observation campain (14 nights between October and\nDecember 2005) were found. The excess location is consistent with the pulsar\n\n\f166\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nE 2 dF/dE\n\nMeV cm -2 s -1\n\nMAGIC 95% U.L.\nCeleste (De Naurois 2002)\nWhipple (Lessard 2000)\n\n10 -3\n\nEGRET (Fierro 1998)\nEGRET (Fierro 1998) and 27 GeV exponential cutoff\nOuter Gap (Hirotani 2007)\n\n10 -4\n\n10 -5\n\n10 -6\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n6\n\n7\n\nEnergy\n\n10\nMeV\n\nCounts\n\nFigure 5: Upper limits on the pulsed \u03b3 ray flux from Crab pulsar.

They support the generally accepted picture of emission which can be described in the\nSSC-model framework (for example [2])\n5\n\nSearch for pulsed emission from PSR B1951+32 and\nPSR B0531+21(Crab)\n\nThe pulsar magnetosphere hosts particle acceleration, as also implied by the\ndetected \u03b3 ray emission. The main models of partcle acceleration in pulsars\nassume the acceleration to take place above the polar cap of the neutron star\n([18]), or in the outer gap of the magnetosphere([11]). Also the region of\ninteraction between the pulsar wind and the interstellar medium might host\nparticle acceleration. PSR B1951+32 is one of the six pulsars which were\ndetected with EGRET [25].\nPSR B1951+32 was observed with MAGIC and was searched for steady\nVHE \u03b3 emission. Only upper limits to the integral (\u03c6(E>140GeV) < 1.5 10\u221211\nph cm\u22122 s\u22121 , with 95% confidence level) and to differential fluxes (see [6]) were\nobtained. Also the radio nebula CTB 80, thought to be associated to the\npulsar, was searched for \u03b3 emission and was not detected. The pulsed emission\nwas searched as reported in details in [6]. Upper limits to the pulsed emission\nwere obtained in various energy bands, ranging from 1.5 10\u221211 to 2.5 10\u221213 ph\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 . It was possible to set an upper limit also on the cutoff energy of the\npulsed emission, which is Ecutof f < 32GeV.\nIn the same way Crab pulsar (PSR B0531+21) was searched for pulsed\nemission, with MAGIC. Pulsed emission was searched in five energy bands (5)\nbetween 60 GeV and 9 TeV and no significant signal was found. The upper limit\nto the pulsed emission cutoff energy was calculated to be Ecutof f < 27GeV.\nIn Fig.6 is shown the pulse shape profile of the Crab pulsar. MAGIC data are\nfor energies below 180 GeV. Also the optical pulse shape profile was measured\nwith MAGIC. If the EGRET phase regions are defined as signal region the\nsignificance of the structures in the MAGIC phaseogram have significance of\n2.9\u03c3. Then no pulsed emission was found in PSR B1951+32 or Crab pulsar,\nalthough a hint of signal is in the MAGIC phaseogram of Crab.\nReferences\n[1] Aharonian, F. et al. 2001, A&A 112, 307\n[2] Aharonian, F. et al. 2004, ApJ 614, 897\n[3] Albert, J. et al.

In this\ncommunication a selected sample of highlights are presented.\n\n1\n\nThe H.E.S.S. telescope system\n\nThe H.E.S.S. array, a system of four large (13 m diameter) imaging atmospheric Cerenkov telescopes, is operated since December 2003 by an international collaboration of about 100 physicists. Located in the Khomas highland\nof Namibia, the H.E.S.S. system covers a 5o field of view, with a sensitivity\nwhich allows to detect sources with a flux of 1% of the Crab Nebula in 25 h\nof observation and an energy threshold between 100 and 700 GeV increasing\nwith the observation zenith angle. The four telescopes provide multiple images of gamma-ray induced air showers in the Cerenkov light emitted by the\nshower particles, enabling the stereoscopic reconstruction of the shower geometry and the shower energy. The estimated energy resolution is 15% and 0.1o\nis the angular resolution for individual gamma-ray corresponding to 1\u2032 location\nposition of a VHE gamma-ray source. A personal selection of the highlights\nfrom H.E.S.S. is imposed by the lack of space: most recent published results\n169\n\n\f170\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nfrom the galactic plane survey and dedicated source observations together with\na summary on the studies of shell-type supernova remnants and pulsar wind\nnebulae will be the main topics of this letter.\n2\n\nThe H.E.S.S. galactic plane survey\n\nThe Galactic plane survey was conducted in the summer of 2004 covering the\nregion of -30o to 30o galactic longitude and -2.5o to 2.5o in galactic latitude,\nresulting in 15 new VHE gamma ray sources plus three previously known.\nSearching for counterparts in radio- and X-ray catalogs they resulted to be related to SNR, a significant fraction to PWNe and at least three \"Dark accelerators\" without counterpart known. A new observation campaign was conducted\nduring the years 2005-2007 with the scanned region now reaching from -80o to\n60o galactic longitude. The number of new sources is more than 15 with 6 new\n\"Dark accelerators\", others sources incrementing the known classes and some\nnew results. Details on published results on the two campaigns can be found\nin [1] and [2] respectively.\n2.1 HESS J1023-575\nThe discovery [3] of the source HESS J1023-575 is one of the most relevant\nhighlight of the 2006 data taking: a clue to the investigation on the cosmicrays origin. The detection of VHE gamma-ray emission associated with the\nyoung stellar cluster Westerlund 2 in the HII complex RCW 49 provides evidence that particle acceleration to extreme energies is associated with this\nregion, a luminous massive star formation region already well studied at various wavelengths. The source (Fig. 1) has been observed for a total 14 h of\ndata for a corresponding statistical significance of more than 9 \u03c3 and clearly\nextended beyond the nominal PSF. The differential energy spectrum, extended\nabout two order of magnitude in energy and with a minimum threshold of 380\nGeV, can be described by a power law with index 2.53 \u00b1 0.16 and an integral\nflux of 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . A variety of potential emission scenarios\nare suggested [4] for the interpretation of HESS J1023-575, a new type of astronomical object, profoundly distinguished from other source findings made\nduring Galactic Plane Scan observations. Further investigation with H.E.S.S.\nwill allow to discriminate among alternative interpretations.\n3\n\nStudy of the shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs)\n\nTwo supernova shells already detected as gamma sources by CANGAROO,\nRX J1713.7-3946 [5] and RX J0852.0-4622 (\"Vela Junior\") [6](Fig. 2), are now\nfirmly established VHE gamma-ray emitters and morphologically resolved by\nH.E.S.S.. The energy spectra follow a power law with index of about 2.3,\n\n\fG. Lamanna for the H.E.S.S. collaboration\n\nH.E.S.S.

Right: HESS\nJ1023 5, 7, and 9 \u03c3 significance contours overlaid on a radio image.\n\nconstant across the entire remnants. For both sources, the gamma-ray shell\nintensity observed with H.E.S.S. is highly correlated with the X-rays one. This\ncorrelation would be natural if a common population of primary electrons were\nresponsible for both emission regimes. Assuming that X-rays represents synchrotron radiation and that the gamma rays are generated in Inverse Compton\nscattering, as it is shown in Fig. 3, simple electronic models assuming an electron injection index of 2.5 and with a local magnetic field of B \u223c 10 \u03bcG,\nwhich accommodates both levels of spectra, fail to consistently fit the multiwavelength data (e.g.: over shooting the radio flux [8]). In contrast models assuming higher magnetic field and adding gamma-rays from proton-interactions,\nachieve a good description of wide-band spectra [7]. This interpretation would\nsupport the hadronic origin of gamma rays even if a conclusive evidence is\nstill lacking. The currently modest number of shell SNR resolved in VHE has\nbeen increased by the recent observation of RCW 86, a supernova remnant\nwith a barrel-shaped shell, visible in X-rays, radio and optical waves. Hints\nfor gamma-ray emission were seen with CANGAROO-II instrument, but no\nfirm detection was claimed. A clear gamma-ray signal with more than 9 \u03c3 has\nbeen detected by H.E.S.S.. A detailed analysis is in progress and preliminary\nresults [9] have shown: a flux 5-10% of the Crab nebula, a 2.3-2.5 spectral index\nand a shell type morphology.\n\n\f172\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 2: Shell supernova remnants seen in gamma rays by H.E.S.S.: RX\nJ1713.7-3946 (lef t) and RX J0852.0-4622 (right).\n3.1 HESS J1800-240 and HESS J1801-233\nAn other composite or mixed-morphology SNR, which is an ideal target for\nVHE observations, is W 28 (G6.4-0.1). The old-age W 28 SNR is thought to\nhave entered its radiative phase of evolution. The shell-like radio emission peaks\nat the northern and northeastern boundaries where interaction with molecular\ncloud is established. The X-ray emission, which overall is well-explained by\na thermal model, peaks in the SNR center but has local enhancements in the\nnortheastern SNR/molecular cloud interaction region. On the south boundary several HII regions, including ultra-compact HII region W 28A2 are found.\nH.E.S.S. observations of W 28 have revealed VHE gamma-ray emission situated\nat its northeastern (HESS J1801-233) and southern boundaries (HESS J1801240 with components A, B and C) (Fig. 4) [10]. A multi-wavelength analysis\nof W 28 has revealed a dense molecular cloud enveloping the southern region,\nand EGRET MeV/GeV emission centered on HESS J1801-233 and the northeastern interaction region. Overall, these results suggest that old-age SNRs\nare capable of multi-TeV particle accelerators and candidate hadrons diffusive\nshock accelerators.\n4\n\nStudy of the Pulsar Wind Nebulae\n\nPulsar Wind Nebulae (PWN) are responsible for a significant fraction of the\nnew VHE Galactic sources observed by H.E.S.S.. The purpose of the PWN\nstudy is a diagnostic of the spatial and spectral distribution of the high energy electrons responsible of the TeV gamma-ray production dominated by the\nInverse Compton scattering off the well-known cosmic microwave background.\nHESS J1825-137 is a particularly interesting PWN candidate: it is a strong\n\n\fG.

It was detected during the first\nGalactic plane survey and then further observed. It is located south of the\npulsar PSR B1823-13 which exhibits an X-ray nebula trailing extended over\n\u223c5' in the direction of the VHE source but then much smaller in size. A natural explanation is that the X-ray generating electrons (via interaction with\nthe nebula magnetic field \u223c10 \u03bcG) have higher energies than those responsible\nvia Inverse Compton scattering for the VHE gamma rays. The higher energy\nX-ray electrons cool faster and have a shorted range. More importantly, for\nthe first time observations have revealed the energy dependent morphology of\nthe source. This manifests itself as a steepening of the power-law spectral index with increasing distance from the pulsar, as would be expected from the\nradiative losses of high-energy electrons injected by the pulsar (see Fig. 5).\nAmong the number of PWNe detected by H.E.S.S. and apart from the almost point-like Crab nebula, extensively studied through different consecutive\nobservation campaigns [12], Vela X associated with the Vela pulsar (Fig. 6)\nis likely the most extended one (about a degree south of the pulsar) and significantly old (age \u223c11 kyr). The energy spectrum is very hard reaching 50\nTeV. The radio, X-rays and VHE gamma-rays emission regions of Vela X are\nmarkedly offset from the pulsar position. This may be due to the supernova\nexplosion occurring in an inhomogeneous medium, and the resulting asymmetric reverse shock displacing the PWN in the direction away from the higher\ndensity medium. The displacement of the nebulae from the pulsar positions is\na surprising constant of almost of extended PWN candidate sources. It is also\nthe case of MSH 15-52, associated with the pulsar PSR B1509-58 inside the G\n\n\f174\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 4: W 28 VHE gamma-rays excess map with 4, 5 and 6\u03c3 contour levels\nfor HESS J1801-233 and HESS J1801-240 A, B and C sources.\n\nFigure 5: HESS J1825-137, a PWN candidate manifesting an offset from the\nassociated pulsar position, a steepening of the power-law spectral index with\nincreasing distance from the pulsar and a larger extension than in X-ray.\n\n\fG.

This elongated and single-sided nebula was revealed\nby H.E.S.S. as aligned in the same direction of the jet-like high-resolution X-ray\nChandra image. More recently, studies of the \"Kookaburra\" region revealed\ntwo new TeV gamma-ray sources, one most likely associated with the pulsar\nPSR J1420-6048, the other one with the \"Rabbit\" feature presumably resulting\nfrom another pulsar. Both sources have relatively hard spectra index around\n2.2, both are extended on the scale of about 10 pc and both are displaced by\na similar amount from their pulsars.\nRe-observations of the mentioned extended PWNe have been recently accomplished and analysis are in progress to further infer about the spectral and\nspatial distribution of the energetic electrons within the leptonic interpretation\nof the VHE emission.\nA systematic search for gamma-ray counterparts of known pulsars is addressed by the possibility that all pulsars have associated VHE gamma rays\n\n\f176\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nnebulae. Such a research has produced a bunch of new PWN candidates: e.g.:\nHESS J1718-385 and HESS J1809-193 (Fig. 7) [13]. They show that among\npulsars with a spin-down energy flux above 1035 ergs/s/kpc2, a large fraction is\nvisible as gamma-ray emitters, converting about 1% of their spin-down energy\ninto 1-10 TeV gamma rays. This implies that about 10% of pulsar spin-down\nenergy is fed into high-energy electrons. More observations of these sources\nand corresponding multi-wavelength investigations would provide important\nprogress in the physics of PWNe.\nReferences\n[1] F. Aharonian et al, Astrophy.

No indication of variability\nwas observed on nightly timescales either. Right: SED of the same object,\nwith contemporaneous data shown as filled symbols. The line is a fit with a\nsingle-zone homogenous SSC model. The lack of variability occurs at a time\nwhen the source appears to be less intense than archival observations.\nThe mere detection of a blazar above a given significance level, usually 5\nstandard deviations (or \u03c3), used to indicate an eruptive episode, because most\nof the time the source went undetected given the achieved sensitivity. It is\nnow rather striking that detections of blazars often occur when simultaneous\nobservations of their synchrotron component, where for obvious reasons archival\ndata exist to compare with, indicate that the flux levels are close to the lower\narchival levels. Also for most of the recently discovered blazars with ACTs\nshow relatively flat lightcurves.\nThe multi-wavelength campaign organized to observe PKS 2155-304 in 2003,\nthought to be in a high emission state after consecutive nightly detections by\nH.E.S.S. at the 20% Crab level, showed that the simultaneously measured optical and X-ray levels below those observed in its high state [2] by an order of\nmagnitude. Interestingly, the small level of variability in the different wavelenghts (\u2206F/F \u2248 3 in both X-rays and \u03b3-rays) was not correlated during these\nobservations, while they were actually seen to be correlated at higher fluxes\nin the 2004 campaign [3]. Similar \u03b3-ray detections in low-state synchrotron\n\n\f180\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nstates were found in the BL Lac object H 2356-309 (Fig.1) with H.E.S.S.

The\nsampling is 1', and the dotted line shows the 1 Crab level.\nThe fastest resolved transient in the light curve of Fig.2 has a rising timescale\nof tvar = 173 \u00b1 28 s, which is a factor of 60 to 120 times smaller than the light\ncrossing time of the Schwarzschild radius RS of the 1\u22122\u00d7109M\u2299 black hole\nin the nucleus [7]. Doppler boosting of exactly this amount would then allow\nan emission region radius R of the order of RS , the smallest characteristic size\nin the system, but at the price of a rather large Lorentz bulk factor this presumes, greater than those typically derived for VHE \u03b3-ray blazars (\u03b4\u223c10) and\ncome close to those used for GRBs, which would be a challenge to understand.\nLower values of \u03b4 were derived with similar timescales for Mkn 421 [8], but\nthe remarkable difference for that observation was the rather large spectral\nvariability seen during an outburst,contrary to the outburst of PKS 2155-304.\nThe power density spectrum (PDS) of this light curve is similar to those\nderived in X-rays for this object, a featureless power-law Fourier spectrum of\nindex -2 reaching the white noise level at \u223c 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 Hz (600 s) [7], but with\n\n\fB.

An observed spectrum F (E)\nis then different from the intrinsic Fi spectrum with Fi (E) = F (E)/ exp \u2212\u03c4 (E),\n\u03c4 (E) being the optical depth. For 100 GeV \u2212 10 TeV photons, the photon field\nin the 0.1 \u2212 10 \u03bcm is probed and its intensity sets the level of attenuation that\naffects Fi .\n\nFigure 3: Spectra energy distribution of the Extragalactic Background Light, in\nthe 0.1\u221210\u03bcm band where the H.E.S.S. data are most affected. The curves show\nthe shapes used to constrain the EBL density, with the thick line indicating\nthe range where the data constrain directly the shape. Details are in [9].\nHowever the shape of Fi is never known, so assumptions have to be largely\nmodel-dependent to derive constraints on the EBL. For instance, assuming\nthat the intrinsic photon index \u0393i of Fi (E) cannot be larger than 1.5 in the\nVHE range, one can readily test some EBL models by constructing the intrinsic\nspectrum they would predict: the models violating the initial assumption on\n\u0393i are then seriously in doubt.\n\n\f182\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nAnother possibility to derive the spectral energy distribution of the EBL\nconsists in assuming a specific shape for it, and to leave the overall normalization as a free parameter only constrained by the fact that its imprint on the\nVHE spectrum should not yield a \u0393i smaller than 1.5. Applying this to the object 1ES 1101-232, one of the most distant blazars listed in Table 1, [9] derived\nlimits on the EBL by scaling a model designed to be in general agreement with\nthe EBL spectrum expected from galaxy emission [10].\nThe rather low EBL level obtained this way is in good agreement with the\nexpectations of standard galaxy evolution models, and is an indication that the\nUniverse is more transparent to \u03b3-rays than initially thought. A similar study\non the object 1ES 1218+30.4 (which has also a very flat VHE light curve!),\ndetected by the MAGIC experiment, yielded similar results, showing that the\nEBL level is remarkably close to the 'incompressible' leve derived from resolved\nsource counts.\n5\n\nNon-blazars\n\nA result awaiting a decisive confirmation was the detection in VHE \u03b3-rays of\nthe nearby (z = 0.0008) radio galaxy M87 by the HEGRA experiment. The\nlarge angle of the jet with the line of sight, estimated to be \u03b8 = 35\u25e6 , makes it\nan unlikely VHE source since Doppler boosting would be too low to make it\nbright enough. However the marginal detection of Cen A, an object similar to\nM87 but with \u03b8 = 60\u25e6 , by the EGRET experiment [11], shows the potential of\nthis nearby unbeamed population of AGN.\nBesides confirming M87 as a VHE emitter, variability on daily timescales\nwas detected by H.E.S.S.

The\nyearly fluxes, along with the Chandra measurements of the knot HST-1, are in\nthe bottom plot.\nare on the lower bound of archival observations when those are available. Observations of rather low X-ray fluxes are the most convincing fact, since \u03b3-ray\nvariability correlates best with X-rays (even though some ponctual exceptions\nexist). Having access to quiescent states will give insights on the duty cycle of\nblazars, as well as rise the question of the relationship with the more variable\nhigh flux emission region when these appear.\nIndividually, spectral measurements of the most distant blazars in VHE \u03b3rays have considerably constrained the intensity of the EBL in the 0.1 \u2212 10 \u03bcm\nband, although in a model-dependent way. With little room left for additional\ncomponents in the EBL, the the steep VHE spectra from relatively nearby\nobjects can be deemed to be due to the intrinsic physical mechanisms at play\nin the accelerator, rather than EBL attenuation.

These will be shown and\npublished elsewhere. The monitoring of blazars with the current generation of\nACTs could yield other surprises, the radically different spectral behaviour of\nPKS 2155-304 and Mkn 501 having yet to be understood.\nReferences\n[1] H.

Recent searches for dark matter annihilation sources are reported\nin this paper. A strong signal from the high energy source HESS J1745290 has been found in the vicinity of the Galactic Center. Limits on the\ncontribution of WIMPs annihilation to this signal are given. Dark matter annihilations were also searched towards the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf\nelliptical galaxy. Constraints on high energy particle models from the\nnegative results of this search are reported.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe H.E.S.S. (High Energy Stereoscopic System) instrument is an array of four\n107 m2 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes installed in Namibia. It is\noperated by a collaboration of \u223c 100 astrophysicists mostly from Germany and\nFrance. Details on the H.E.S.S. collaboration and the operation of the array of\ntelescopes are given on the H.E.S.S. collaboration homepage.\n\n1 address:\n\nhttp://www.mpi-hd.mpg.de/hfm/HESS/\n\n185\n\n\f186\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nPopular particle physics models such as the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) or Universal Extra Dimensions (\"Kaluza-Klein\" [15]) predict WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles) dark matter annihilations in\ngalactic halos. These annihilations could give observable signals in Cherenkov\ntelescopes (for a review see [6]). The flux d\u03a6/dE\u03b3 of gamma rays is\n1 dN\u03b3 < \u03c3v >  \u0304\nd\u03a6\nJ\u2206\u03a9.\n=\ndE\u03b3\n4\u03c0 dE\u03b3 M\u03c72\n\n(1)\n\nIt is the product of an astrophysical term J \u0304 and a particle physics term. The\nformer depends on the mass density profile \u03c1 of the dark halo\nZ\n\u03c12 ds > .\n(2)\nJ \u0304 =<\nl.o.s\n\nIn equation 2, the average is taken over the solid angle \u2206\u03a9 spanned by the\nPoint Spread Function (PSF). The spatial resolution of H.E.S.S. is of the order\nof 5 arc minutes per event, giving \u2206\u03a9 = 2 10\u22125 . The particle physics term\ndepends on the velocity averaged annihilation cross section < \u03c3v > and the\nWIMP mass M\u03c7 . A typical analytical dN\u03b3 /dE\u03b3 photon spectrum [10] was used\nfor the MSSM studies. The photon spectrum from the annihilation of the B 1\nboson of the Kaluza-Klein model was obtained directly with PYTHIA 2 .\nThe possible targets for WIMP annihilation searches can be ranked accord \u0304 If the annihilation signal from a halo located at distance\ning to their values of J.\nD is \"point-like\", then J \u0304 \u221d M 2 /D5 where M is the (often measured) dark mass\ninside the PSF. The best astrophysical targets are thus the Galactic Center and\nnearby dwarf galaxies. The expected flux from galaxy clusters such as Virgo or\nComa is smaller by at least 3 orders of magnitude. It is also possible to look for\ndark matter clumps. This paper reports limits on a dark matter contribution\nto the signal of the Galactic Center source HESS J1745-290 [1] and the observation of a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, the Sgr dwarf elliptical galaxy\n[2]. H.E.S.S. has also observed several galaxy clusters. The observations of the\ncenter of the Virgo cluster (the M 87 galaxy) are reported in [5].\n2\n\nThe Galactic Center source HESS J1745-290\n\nH.E.S.S. has detected a bright, point-like source, HESS J1745-290, near the\nGalactic Center [4]. The size of the emission region is smaller than 15 pc.\nDiffuse emission has been detected along the galactic plane [3], also in the\nvicinity of the Galactic Center. Diffuse emission correlates well with the mass\ndensity of the molecular clouds of the Central Molecular Zone as measured by\nthe CS line [16].

In the 2004 [4] and 2006 [1]\nH.E.S.S. papers, the position of the source was quoted with systematic errors\nof roughly 30 arc seconds. Recently, a careful study [17] allowed to lower the\npointing errors down to the level of 8 arc seconds. The preliminary position of\nthe source is located at an angular distance of 7.3 \u2032\u2032 \u00b1 8.7 \u2032\u2032 (stat) \u00b1 8.5\u2032\u2032 (syst)\nfrom the central galactic black hole Sgr A*. The new accurate position of\nHESS J1745-290 is incompatible with the centroid of the radio emission of the\nsupernova remnant Sgr A East, but still compatible with sources such as the\npulsar wind nebula G359.95-0.04.\nThe spectrum of HESS J1745-290 (figure 1) is well fitted by a power-law\nspectrum in the energy range (160 GeV-30 TeV) with a spectral index \u0393 =\n2.25 \u00b1 0.04 (stat) \u00b1 0.1 (syst). No deviation from a power-law spectrum is seen,\nwhich implies a cut-off energy of more than 9 TeV (95% CL). The emission\nof HESS J1745-290 does not show any significant variability or periodicity at\ntime-scales ranging from 10 minutes to 1 year [18].\nThe signal of HESS J1745-290 can been interpreted by a large variety of\nastrophysical models (see e.g. [9] and references inside). The possible nonstandard interpretation of the HESS J1745-290 signal as annihilation of dark\nmatter particles has been investigated by the H.E.S.S. collaboration [1]. The\nobserved spectrum (figure 1) is not well fitted by expected annihilation spectra. Limits on the annihilation cross-section can be given by assuming that the\nobserved signal is a blend of an astrophysical source and dark matter annihi-\n\n\f188\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of \u03b82 for Sgr dwarf galaxy. \u03b8 is the angular distance\nbetween the direction of the gamma event and the target position.

It is located in the galactic\nplane in the direction of the Galactic Center, at a distance of 24 kpc. This\ngalaxy was discovered only recently [11]. It is being torn apart by the tidal\nforce of the Galaxy. The visible mass profile of the Sgr dwarf galaxy is difficult\nto obtain because of the contamination of galactic foreground stars. The center\nof the Sgr dwarf galaxy is coincident with the globular cluster M 54 [12]. The\ninterpretation of velocity dispersion measurements is difficult because of the\ntidal interaction with the Milky Way. The central velocity dispersion has been\nmeasured by several groups (see e.g. [19]).\nThe Sgr dwarf galaxy has been observed by H.E.S.S. in June 2006. After\nquality cuts, a total exposure of 11 hours was obtained. As shown on figure\n2, no significant excess of signal was found at the location of M 54. Less than\n56 photons (95% CL) with an energy of more than 250 GeV (corresponding\nroughly to the analysis threshold) are detected at a position of less than 8.4\narc-minutes from the center of M 54.\n\n10-22\n\n10-24\npMSSM + Cusped NFW profile\n\n-26\n\n10\n\npMSSM + Cored profile\npMSSM predictions\npMSSM predictions + WMAP\n\n-28\n\n10\n\n-30\n\n10\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nmDM (TeV)\n\nFigure 3: 95% CL upper limits on < \u03c3v > versus the neutralino mass obtained\nfrom the HESS J1745-290 signal.

As in the Galactic Center study, our reference model has a\nNFW mass profile. The parameters of this model were taken from [8]. Another\nmodel (a cored isothermal model) also inspired from reference [8] was studied.\nDifferences with the cored model of [8] include\n1. A different velocity dispersion profile\nThe velocity dispersion of the Sgr dwarf stars is supposed to be independent of position and equal to the measured value of the central velocity\ndispersion ([19]). In reference [8], the velocity dispersion data were the\nmeasured values of the Draco dwarf galaxy. As in [8], the velocity dispersion tensor was assumed to be isotropic.\n2. A different mass density profile.\nThe density profile of stars is taken from reference [12]. The cored profile\nmodel has a very small core due to a \"cusp\" in the mass density profile.\n\n\fJ-F. Glicenstein, H.E.S.S. collaboration\n\nSearches for dark matter with H.E.S.S.191\n\nThe value of J \u0304 for the cored profile model turns out to be larger than that of\nthe NFW model. Figure 3 shows the constraint obtained on the < \u03c3v > values\nof the MSSM models. The predictions of the MSSM (see [6]) were obtained\nwith DarkSusy 4.1 [7] and are plotted as purple points.

Figure 4 shows the constraints on < \u03c3v > for the Kaluza-Klein model.\nThe prediction of the Kaluza-Klein model is shown as a blue line. The yellow\nsegment gives a relic density compatible with the measurements of the WMAP\nsatellite. Values of < \u03c3v >\u2265 10\u221225 (cored mass profile) or < \u03c3v >\u2265 10\u221223\n(NFW mass profile) are excluded at the 95% CL for the Kaluza-Kein model.\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nThe H.E.S.S. collaboration has studied two potential sources of dark matter\nannihilations: the Galactic Center and the Sgr dwarf galaxy. Constraints on\nthe annihilation cross section have been given. These constraints are still one to\ntwo order of magnitude larger than the prediction (assuming an NFW profile).\nThe energy threshold is around 250 GeV. In the phase 2 of H.E.S.S., starting\nin 2009, the analysis threshold will be lowered down to \u223c 80 GeV or less. This\nwill allow to explore more supersymmetric models.\nReferences\n[1] F.

The gamma rays can be measured through e+epair conversion in the Silicon Tracker, as well as single photons directly\ndetected in the Electromagnetic Calorimeter. AMS-02 will provide precise gamma measurements in the 1 GeV up to the few hundreds GeV\nrange, which are particularly relevant for Dark Matter searches. In addition, the good angular resolution and identification capabilities of the\ndetector will allow clean studies of the main galactic and extra-galactic\nsources and the observation of the high energy tail of some GRB.\n\n1\n\nThe AMS experiment\n\nThe Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a cosmic ray experiment which\nwill be attached to the International Space Station (ISS) for three years, being launch ready in 2008. It is a major collaboration of European, Asian and\nAmerican institutions, together with NASA. The main purpose of AMS measurements is to determine the characteristics of the incident particle such as\nits momentum, charge, velocity and mass, to the highest possible precision, to\nensure its identification.\nA precursor flight, AMS-01 [1], with a reduced acceptance and magnetic\nfield and without electromagnetic calorimeter, has already succesfully flown on\n193\n\n\f194\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 1: The AMS-02 detector.\nboard of the Space Shuttle Discovery for 10 days in 1998: it has performed\nimportant measurement of the spectrum of primary and secondary protons,\nHelium, electrons and positrons and has improved the limit on the flux of\ncosmic antihelium.\nThe AMS-02 detector (fig. 1) has a cylindrical symmetry with a radius \u223c2\nm and an height \u223c3 m for a total weight of about 7 tons. Its main components\nare: the Superconducting Magnet, producing a dipolar field with a bending\npower BL2 = 0.85 T m2 ; the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) [2]; the\nSilicon Tracker Detector (STD) [3], capable to measure the particle rigidity\nup to \u223c1 TV; the Time Of Flight (TOF) detector [4]; the AntiCoincidence\nCounters (ACC) used to inihibit the charged particle trigger provided by the\nTOF when the particles come from the side of the detector; the Ring Imaging\nCHerenkov (RICH) [5] and the Electromagnetic CALorimeter (ECAL) [6], a\nsampling calorimeter composed of scintillating fibers and lead with 9 superlayers alternated with the fibers along X or Y directions perpendicular to the\ndetector axis, for a total of 17 radiation lengths.\nThe major scientific goals of AMS-02 include dark matter, and anti-matter\nsearches, cosmic ray related astrophysics and, last but not least, gamma ray\nastronomy. Photons can be detected in AMS-02 following two complemen-\n\n\fS. Di Falco\n\nPhoton detection with AMS-02\n\n195\n\ntary methods: the photon conversion in an e+ e\u2212 pair and the direct photon\nmeasurement in the calorimeter.\n2\n\nDetection of photon conversions\n\nThe material in front of the first silicon tracker layer corresponds to \u223c 0.3 X0 ,\nso there's a significant probability (\u223c25%) for a photon to convert in the upper\npart of the detector into an e+ e\u2212 pair that can be detected by the STD.\nA photon conversion in AMS will have the following characteristics: no hits\nin the upper TRD layers; a couple of tracks well reconstructed in the STD; a\nvertex located in the TRD or in the upper TOF; the invariant mass of the 2\ntracks close to 0; the extrapolated photon direction not crossing the mechanical\nstructure of the detector; the total amount of hits in all the subdetector compatible with just 2 relativistic particles; the energy deposits in the calorimeter,\nif any, compatible with electromagnetic showers.\nThe last 3 requests have been inserted to suppress the background, mainly\ndue to \u03b4 rays produced by protons or electrons before the STD.\nThe photon energy resolution is[7]:\n\u03c3E\n= (3.2 \u2295 0.05 * E(GeV ))%\nE\nthat is \u223c3% below 30 GeV increasing to 10% at 200 GeV.\nThe angular resolution defined as the 68% containment angle is[8]:\n\u0011o\n\u0010\n\u03c368 = \u22120.57 + 0.58 * e1/E(GeV )\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\ni.e. 1o at 1 GeV improving to 0.015o at 200 GeV.\nConsidering as signal the photons coming from the galactic center the background to signal ratio is of the order of 104 for protons and 102 for electrons.\nThe rejection power of the analysis cuts is better for 104 for both protons and\nelectrons. A further improvement can come, in case of source studies, from the\nexcellent pointing capability obtained by the angular resolution.\n3\n\nDirect Photon Detection\n\nGiven the amount of material present in front of the calorimeter, a photon has\na probability of \u223c70% to reach the ECAL without converting.\nThe AMS photon trigger. Photons not converting before the calorimeter do not relaese enough energy in TOF scintillators to satisfy the TOF trigger conditions, so that a dedicated photon trigger is required. The photon\ntrigger[10] has two levels: the fast trigger, produced before 200 ns, compares\nthe dynode signal of the PMTs of the 6 central ECAL superlayers with a programmable threshold and requires at least 1 PMT dynode above threshold for\n\n\f196\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nat least 2 of the 3 superlayers of each view; the level 1 trigger, produced within\n1 \u03bcs, checks that the particle inclination, obtained from the average position\nof the PMts above threshold in the different superlayers, is below \u223c 20o 1 . The\ntrigger efficiency on photons not converting before the calorimeter is 20% at 1\nGeV, 90% at 2 GeV and better than 99% above 5 GeV. The total trigger rate\nis negligible with respect to the TOF trigger rate.\nA photon directly interacting in the calorimeter can be recognized as an\nelectromagnetic shower 2 in the calorimeter without any hits in the other detectors.\nThe main background is due to secondary particles, namely \u03c0 0 , produced\nby proton interactions in the mechanical structure of the magnet and can be\nsuppressed by asking that the reconstructed photon direction crosses all the\nothers subdetectors.\nAccording to the results of the ECAL test beam in 2002[11], confirmed by\nthe ECAL flight model test beam of July 2007, the photon energy resolution\nis:\n!\n\u03c3E\n10.4\n%\n(3)\n= 2.1 \u2295 p\nE\nE(GeV )\nthat is \u223c6% at 2 GeV improving to \u223c2% above 100 GeV.\nThe angular resolution at 0o defined as the 68% containment angle is:\n\u03c368 =\n\n7.5\n\n0.2 + p\nE(GeV )\n\n!o\n\n(4)\n\ni.e. 5o at 1 GeV improving to 1o at 100 GeV. Photon inclination also improves the angular resolution, thanks to the larger energy deposit: for example\nat 20o it's 0.5o at 100 GeV.\nThe selection efficiency for photons with an angle lower than 20o is \u223c 10 %\nat 1 GeV, \u223c 50% at 2 GeV and \u223c 80% above 10 GeV.\nThe low efficiency at low energy is partly due to the tight cuts used for\nthe background rejection: the rejection factor on protons is about 10 at 1 GeV\nwhile is about 104 above 10 GeV.\nAlso in this case further background suppression can come from the pointing\nto the source.\n\n1 This\n\ncorresponds to the request that the photon crosses all the other AMS subdetectors.\nenergy deposit that satisfies the lateral and longitudinal profile, the collimation\nand the compactness expected for the interaction of an electromagnetic particle in the\ncalorimeter[9].\n2 An\n\n\fS.

It will be covered by the ISS in \u223c92 minutes.\nConsidering as an example the whole opening angle of the two detection\nmethods, integrating over 15 precession periods (\u223c 3 years) one finds a total\nexposition time to a 1o \u00d7 1o pixel around the galactic center of 120 days for the\nconversion method and 60 days for the direct detection 3 .\nDue to the limited opening angle and to the latitude limits of the ISS orbit,\nthere are 2 regions of the galactic sky in which the direct photon measurement\ncannot be applied: for longitude \u221280o < l < \u221260o and latitude \u221240o < b <\n\u221210o and 110o < l < 140o , 10o < b < 40o .

AGILE is the\nfirst small scientific mission of ASI, is devoted to the study of the High\nEnergy Astrophysics in the hard X-ray and gamma ray energy bands\nand was launched on 23rd April 2007. SuperAGILE is expected to image Gamma Ray Bursts and bright transients directly on-board, basing\non the instrument ratemeters, integrated on various timescales from 64\nms up to 8 s. The accumulated image is deconvolved on-board by an\nalgorithm introduced in the Payload Data Handling Unit and the event\ncoordinates are rapidly transmitted to Earth by using the ORBCOMM\nsatellite constellation. Shorter transients (down to the sub-ms level) can\nbe detected but are not located. The on-board Gamma Ray Burst detection system has been extensively tested in laboratory by using radioactive\nsources. In this contribution we describe the SuperAGILE Gamma Ray\nBurst detection system and report about the laboratory testing.\n\n201\n\n\f202\n1\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nThe SuperAGILE scientific performances\n\nSuperAGILE is the hard X-ray monitor of the AGILE satellite-borne mission\nof the Italian Space Agency (ASI), launched from the Satish Dawan Space\nCentre (India) on 23rd April 2007. AGILE is devoted to the High Energy\nAstrophysics and its payload is composed of two instruments: the Gamma Ray\nImaging Detector (GRID), with about 2.5 sr Field of View (FOV) and sensitive\nin the 30 MeV \u2013 50 GeV energy band, and SuperAGILE, with about 1 sr FOV\nand 15 \u2013 45 keV energy band. In turn the GRID is composed of a Silicon\nTracker, with tungsten converters and silicon microstrip detectors, and a Minicalorimeter with CsI(Tl) scintillator bars. AGILE is flying on an equatorial\norbit with about 550 km altitude, 2.5\u25e6 inclination and 100 minutes period. A\ndescription of the AGILE mission may be found in [1].\nSuperAGILE is a coded aperture instrument with four 1-D silicon microstrip\ndetectors of 19 \u00d7 19 cm2 surface each, 121 \u03bcm strip pitch and 410 \u03bcm thickness.\nThe instrument FOV is composed of two orthogonal 1-D areas of 107\u25e6 \u00d7 68\u25e6 ,\noverlapping in the central area of 68\u25e6 \u00d7 68\u25e6 where both 1-D coordinates are\nencoded. The instrument pixel size is 6 arcmin with a source location accuracy\nof 1 \u2013 2 arcmin for intense sources. The nominal energy band is 15 to 45 keV\nand the resulting sensitivity is 1 Crab (corresponding to 4*10\u22121 photons/cm2 /s\nat 15 \u2013 45 keV) at 5\u03c3 significance level in 10 s increasing up to 15 mCrab\n(6 * 10\u22123 photons/cm2 /s) at 5\u03c3 in 50 ks integration time. SuperAGILE is a\nsmall (40 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 14 cm3 ), light (10 kg) and low power (12 W) instrument.\nFurther information about SuperAGILE may be found in [2].\nThe Mini-calorimeter (a description can be found in [3]) is composed of 30\nscintillator bars arranged in two planes, spatially aligned in orthogonal directions. This instrument cooperates with the Silicon Tracker in composing the\nGRID but it is designed also to detect photon transients in its 300 keV \u2013 200\nMeV energy band although it is not an imaging instrument.\n2\n\nThe SuperAGILE Gamma Ray Burst detection and localization\n\nGamma Ray Bursts (GRB) are among the most important scientific objectives\nof AGILE. A detailed description of the GRB observational properties and\ntheoretical models is far beyond the scope of this paper and the interested\nreader is addressed to dedicated reviews (for example [4] and [5]).\nIn brief, GRB are transient events at cosmological distance detected in X\nand gamma rays. One to three such events are detected every day and they do\nnot show repetitions. The distribution of the GRB incoming direction in the\nSky is isotropic (see for example [6]). If T90 is defined as the interval of time\nin which 90 % of the photons are detected, the distribution of T90 is bimodal,\nwith the first peak at 0.6 s, the second peak at 35.5 and a third intermediate class required, as shown in [7]. The GRB spectrum can be described by\n\n\fE. Del Monte,\n\nThe localization of Gamma Ray Bursts by SuperAGILE\n\n203\n\nthe Band function (see [8] for details), composed of two power laws smoothly\nconnected. GRB are often followed by X-ray (see [9] for details), optical and\nradio afterglows, starting just after the prompt event. For this reason a rapid\ncommunication of the GRB coordinates is of primary importance for the study\nof this class of sources.\nThe on-board detection of GRB is introduced in the AGILE Payload Data\nHandling Unit (PDHU) and is based on the SuperAGILE and Mini-calorimeter\nratemeters. The signal and background are estimated by integrating the counting rate in two different timescales: the Signal Integration Time (SIT) and the\nBackground Estimation Time (BET). Allowed values of the SIT are sub-ms, 1\nms, 16 ms, 64 ms, 256 ms, 1024 ms and 8192 ms. The BET can be 8, 16, 33,\n66, 131, 262 and 524 s.\nThe trigger logic compares the nsig counts integrated in the SIT with the\nnbkg ones in the BET using two types of conditions: static logic (with fixed\nthreshold counts nthr ),\nnsig \u2265 \u03b1nbkg + nthr\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is can be either 0 or 1, or adaptive logic (with threshold evaluated\nfrom the background standard deviation \u03c3),\nnsig \u2265 nbkg + n\u03c3.\n\n(2)\n\nTo increase the time resolution, using the SIT between 16 ms and 1024 ms the\nsignal is estimated by a moving average updated every SIT/4 and the trigger\ncondition is checked every SIT/4. Similarly, the signal of the 8192 s SIT is\nestimated with a moving average based on 512 ms intervals. For SIT of 16 ms\nand below the trigger condition is checked every 16 ms.\nThe trigger is applied independently to the four SuperAGILE detectors,\neach one divided in two energy bands for a total number of eight channels,\nand to the two Mini-calorimeter planes. A dedicated lookup-table is used to\naccept or reject the trigger depending on the channels coincidence. Another\nparameter of the burst search procedure is the delay between SIT and BET\nintervals, that can be selected between 0 and 128 s.\nIf a trigger is accepted with SIT ranging from 64 ms to 8192 ms, the accumulation of the four SuperAGILE detector images starts. The accumulation\nstops when the counts in the image are enough to produce a statistically significant localization or when the maximum integration time is reached. Both\nlocalization significance and maximum integration time can be selected. The\nbackground images, continuously accumulated during the burst search procedure, are then subtracted from the signal ones and the resulting images are\ndecoded in order to extract the 1-D position of the transient and the peak\ncounting rate. The background and signal 1-D images and the peak position\n\n\f204\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nand counting rate are formatted in a dedicated telemetry packet and transmitted to the AGILE ground station at Malindi. To avoid the delay due to the\n100 minutes telemetry downlink period, a subset of the information from the\nimaging process is transmitted using the ORBCOMM satellite constellation\nand delivered to the Ground with a typical minutes delay.\nThe SuperAGILE localization procedure cannot be started using SIT values\nlower than 64 ms (sub-ms, 1 ms and 16 ms). The burst search trigger logic\nis the same for SuperAGILE and the Mini-calorimeter, that is not an imaging\ninstrument. The burst search procedure can be configured in order to download\nthe Mini-calorimeter data in photon-by-photon mode in case a SuperAGILE\ntrigger is detected. Further inrmation about the Mini-calorimeter burst search\nprocedure is in [10].\n\n3\n\nLaboratory testing\n\nThe SuperAGILE on-board GRB localization system was experimentally tested\nin order to verify the trigger and the imaging procedures. The test were performed on the integrated satellite using a 109 Cd radioactive source (the X-ray\nline with the highest branching ratio is emitted at 22 keV), positioned inside\na dedicated brass plate with place for two sources and two remote controlled\nshutters. The plate is suspended to an aluminum structure at about 2 m height\nabove SuperAGILE. The shutter uncovers the source in less than 1 s and the\nsource activity is high enough to produce statistically significant images at the\nsource-SuperAGILE distance. A picture of the brass plate used in the test is\nshown in fig 1.\nDuring the test, the source is unocculted using the remote-controlled shutter\nin order to produce a transient. This measurement allows to test the trigger\ncapability, the start time (reconstructed from the trigger time) and the stop\ntime (estimated depending on the statistics in the accumulated image). An\nexample of a time series with the background counting rate (before 3450 s),\nthe source counting rate (between 3450 s and 3600 s), the start time (vertical\ndashed line) and the stop time (vertical dotted line) is shown in fig. 2.\nThe detector images accumulated on-board are compared with the corresponding detector images accumulated off-line from the SuperAGILE photonby-photon data simultaneously recorded. All the images are then decoded and\nthe source position reconstructed on-board is verified against the position extracted from the photon-by-photon data analysed off-line. An example of the\ntwo 1-D reconstructed images of a transient is shown in fig. 3 and 4. By\nthis measurement the on-board imaging reconstruction and source localization\nprocedures are tested.\n\n\fE.

The\nMini-calorimeter can independently detect 40 \u2013 50 GRB per year. Five GRB\nhave been detected by EGRET in the same energy band as the GRID (see\n[11] for details) but the lack of fine localization and redshift measurement did\nnot allow to know their position and fluence.

AGILE orbits in an equatorial Low Earth\nOrbit at 550 km altitude and 2.5\u25e6 inclination. A review of the AGILE scientific\ninstruments can be found in [1] and [2]. The AGILE payload is composed of a\ntungsten-silicon tracker (ST) sensitive in the gamma-ray energy range 30 MeV50 GeV [3], SuperAGILE, an X-ray imager sensitive in the energy range 15-45\nkeV [4], the Minicalorimeter (MCAL) sensitive in the range 0.3 - 200 MeV, and\nan Anticoincidence shield. The Silicon Tracker, together with MCAL and the\nAnticoincidence shield make up the so called Gamma-Ray Imaging Detector\n(GRID). A Payload Data Handling Unit (PDHU) takes care of all subsystems\ndata acquisition and performs dedicated tasks for transients detection. MCAL\nis made of 30 CsI(Tl) bar-shaped scintillator detectors with photodiode readout\nat both ends, arranged in two orthogonal layers. Each bar acts as an independent hodoscopic detector, so that energy and position of interaction can be\nderived from a proper composition of the signals readout at the bar's ends. A\ntechnical description of MCAL can be found in [5].\n2\n\nMCAL design and construction\n\nMCAL is composed of a detection plane made of 30 CsI(Tl) scintillator detectors with the shape of a bar each one 15x23x375 mm in size, arranged in two\northogonal layers, for a total thickness of 1.5 radiation lengths. In a bar the\nreadout of the scintillation light is accomplished by two custom PIN Photodiodes (PD) coupled one at each small side of the bar. For each bar the PDs\nsignals are collected by means of low noise charge preamplifiers, and then conditioned in the Front End Electronics, (FEE). The circuits have been optimized\nfor best noise performance, fast response, combined with low power consumption and a wide dynamic range. For each bar, the energy and the position of\nan interacting gamma-ray or ionizing particle can be evaluated combining the\nsignals of the two PDs.\nThe detection plane is hosted in the upper part of MCAL main frame; the\npreamplifiers are arranged in four boxes on each side of the detection plane and\nat its same level. Below the detection plane is placed the FEE electronics board\nthat has the same area of the whole detection plane. The overall mechanical\nenvelope of MCAL constitutes the lower part of the whole AGILE payload.\n2.1 The bar detectors\nThe active core of AGILE MCAL is made of the CsI(Tl) scintillating bars with\ntwo PIN PD readout. Each bar is wrapped with a reflective coating and ar-\n\n\fM. Marisaldi, et al.\n\nThe Mini-Calorimeter of the AGILE Satellite\n\n211\n\nranged inside a carbon fiber structure that provides rigidity and modularity\nto the detector. A detector bar is characterized by the charge per unit energy\nproduced at PD level by a photon interacting in the crystal at a defined distance from the PD (signal output, expressed in e\u2212 /keV), and by the relation\ngoverning the signal output as a function of the distance of interaction from\nthe PD (light attenuation law). Each bar has been characterized independenly\nwith a collimated 22 Na source at different positions before integration into the\nMCAL flight model. It has been found that an exponential model for the light\nattenuation law is quite a good representation along all the bar extension but\nthe first few cm near the PDs, where border effects are responsible for a deviation from the above law up to 5-7%. The PDs signal U (x), expressed in e\u2212 ,\nas a function of the distance of interaction x from the PD will be described by\na relation like U (x) = EU0 e\u2212\u03b1x , where E is the energy released in the bar, U0\nis the extrapolated signal output for interactions at the PD edge and \u03b1 is defined as the light attenuation coefficient. On the whole set of 32 bars (30 flight\ndetectors plus 2 spares), the average value for U0 was found to be 21 e\u2212 /keV\nwith a standard deviation of 1 e\u2212 /keV; while the average value for \u03b1 was found\nto be 0.028 cm\u22121 with a standard deviation of 0.002 cm\u22121 .\n2.2 Operative modes\nMCAL works in two possible operative modes:\n- GRID mode: when a trigger is issued by the ST all the signals from\nthe MCAL detectors are collected. The scientific objective of this operative mode is to contribute to the GRID event energy reconstruction and\nprovide information for background events rejection.\n- BURST mode: each bar behaves as an independent self triggering detector and generates a continuous stream of information of gamma events\nin the energy range 300 keV-100 MeV. In the data handling system these\ndata are used to detect impulsive variations in count rates. The scientific objective of this operative mode is to provide high energy spectral\ncoverage of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) and other intense transients.\nBoth operative modes can be active at the same time. Due to telemetry limitations BURST mode data are not sent on ground on a photon-by-photon basis\nunless a trigger for a transient is issued by a dedicated Burst Search logic. However BURST data are used to build a broad band energy spectrum (Scientific\nRateMeters, SRM) recorded and stored in telemetry every second. Scientific\nratemeters are organized in 11 bands for each of the two MCAL detection\nplanes and are expected to provide information on the high energy gamma-ray\nbackground in space and its modulation through orbital phases.\n\n\f212\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n2.3 Front-end electronics\nMCAL Front End Electronics (FEE) is physically divided in two different parts:\nthe PD charge pre-amplifiers are mounted in four boxes very close to the PDs,\nwhile all the rest of the electronics is placed on a single board, 415x415 mm2\nin size which contains about 5000 components and that is placed below the\ndetectors. The analogue chain of each PD is common for GRID and BURST\noperations up to the charge pre-amplifier and the shaping amplifier stage with\nshaping time of about 3 \u03bcs to cope with CsI(Tl) scintillation light decay time.\nThe noise figure of the whole branch is contained in about 1000 e\u2212 rms. The\namplified signals are then sent to two independent parallel processing branches,\nfor GRID and BURST operative modes respectively.\n3\n\nOn-ground calibration and scientific performance\n\nMCAL has been tested both as a stand-alone system and as a subsystem of\nthe fully integrated AGILE payload.\nSince the bars light attenuation law can be considered exponential to a\ngood extent, any event's position x and energy E can be calculated according\nto equations 1 and 2\nUB\n(1)\nx = A + B ln\nUA\np\nE = C UA UB\n(2)\n\nwhere A, B and C are constants based on the bar's parameters, UA and UB\nare the signals readout at the bar's PDs, expressed in ADC channels, corrected for the electronic chains offset. The parameters required for energy and\nposition reconstruction have been obtained from stand-alone calibration tests\nperformed on MCAL before integration with the other payload subsystems.\nMoreover these tests allowed to evaluate the instrument overall functionalities\nand performance.\nThe BURST mode has been tested using a collimated 22 Na radioactive\nsource. The source and the collimator were placed on a programmable positioning system able to automatically move the source within a defined set of\ncoordinates. With this setup each MCAL bar was tested in a number of points\nranging between 10 and 13, thus allowing reconstruction of the signal output\nalong the bar. For each bar the signal output curve at an energy of 1.275 MeV\nas a function of the position of interaction was built. This curve was fitted with\nan exponential model to extract the current bar parameters (signal output and\nattenuation coefficient). This set of values was used as preliminar calibration\nparameters for position and energy reconstruction in data analysis software.\nErrors in these calibration parameters give rise to systematic errors, while the\n\n\fM. Marisaldi, et al.\n\nThe Mini-Calorimeter of the AGILE Satellite\n\n213\n\nmain contribution to energy and position resolution is given by the electronic\nnoise.\nAfter stand-alone calibrations, MCAL was integrated with all the other payload instruments and with the PDHU. Since this integration phase, data have\nbeen acquired directly from the PDHU in the form of telemetry packets. With\nthe parameters obtained from stand-alone calibration tests the performance\ndescribed in the following subsections have been obtained.\n3.1 BURST mode performance\nSource position in calibration datasets is properly reconstructed with a 1.8 cm\nstandard deviation, at 1.275 MeV. When a bar is exposed to an uncollimated\n22\nNa source the 1.275 MeV peak is properly reconstructed with a 0.076 MeV\nsigma, thus allowing a 14% FWHM energy resolution at 1.275 MeV. Figure 1\nshows a background count spectrum obtained on ground during satellite integration activity. This spectrum was obtained considering MCAL as a single\ndetector, i.e. summing together the contributions from different bars triggering\nat the same time. The low energy part of the spectrum is dominated by the\n40\nK 1.460 MeV peak and by other features due to natural radioactivity, up to\na few MeV. At higher energies the spectrum is dominated by two broad peaks\nat about 10 and 20 MeV. These peaks are due to cosmic muons crossing one\nor two MCAL planes, respectively. 10 MeV is just the expected energy loss by\na minimum ionizing particle (MIP) in 1.5 cm of CsI.\n3.2 GRID mode performance\nDespite the bars parameters are the same for GRID and BURST modes, to\nevaluate the detectors gain in GRID mode an external trigger is required. Thus\nGRID mode energy calibration was performed after payload integration using\ncosmic ray muons as probes. Figure 2 shows the energy spectra due to muons\nfor the two MCAL detection planes in GRID mode. Fitting the Landau peaks\nfor each bar and comparison with the expected values for MIPs provide a good\ngain calibration for MCAL detectors in GRID mode.\nMuon tracks can be easily selected in a GRID dataset requiring straight\ntrajectories with low scattering angles and a track extended over most of the\nplanes of the ST. Muons trajectories can then be extrapolated to MCAL to obtain the expected interaction position. After gain calibration, from the MCAL\ndata the reconstructed position of interaction was calculated and compared\nto the extrapolated value. A good agreement was obtained, the distribution\nof the deviation with respect to the expected value having a 0.6 cm standard\ndeviation, as shown in figure 3. After fine tuning of calibration parameters an\neven better position resolution is expected. This procedure will be used also\nduring flight operations for MCAL gain calibration in GRID mode.\n\n\f214\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n103\n\nCounts / (s MeV)\n\n102\n10\n1\n10-1\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n1\n\n102\n\n10\n\nEnergy (MeV)\n\n120\n\n120\n\n100\n\n100\n\n80\n\nCounts\n\nCounts\n\nFigure 1: MCAL background count spectrum obtained in BURST mode during satellite integration.

Measurements taken on ground during satellite integration.\n4\n\nBurst Search logic tests\n\nData produced in the BURST branch of the FEE are stored in a derandomizing FIFO and then sent to the PDHU where they are continuously processed\nby a Burst Search (BS) software algorithm for the detection of fast transients.\nThe first task of the BS software is the formation of background ratemeters\n(RMs) evaluated integrating events on different time windows called Search\nIntegration Times (SITs). To account for the different time profiles of a burst,\nthe SITs range from sub-millisecond to several seconds. Furthermore, for each\nSIT several RMs are generated depending on the detector, the events energy\nand position of interaction. For MCAL 9 RMs are evaluated covering 3 ranges\nof energy respectively, from 0.35 to about 0.7 MeV, from 0.7 MeV to about\n1.4 MeV, and above 1.4 MeV; the limits of the ranges can be varied via Telecommands. Events in the first two energy ranges contribute to generate different\nRMs depending on the place of interaction on MCAL; in this case MCAL is\ndevided in four zones. The high energy events contribute to an unique RM.\nEven if the BS logic for the MCAL detector has been thoroughly investigated\nat software level, it was also tested experimentally with a dedicated hardware\nsetup. A 10 cm thick lead collimator has been placed in front of a MCAL side\nand a radioactive source is moved across the collimator opening by means of a\nstepper motor. The motor speed can be adjusted to produce \"bursts\" of different duration between 32 ms and 1.9 s. With this setup it was possible to verify\nall the steps of the BS algorithm, from trigger generation to data transmission.\nA detailed description of the MCAL BS logic as well as of the validation tests\ncarried out on ground can be found in [6]. Also SuperAGILE contributes to\nthe BS in the energy range 15-45 keV, providing additional imaging and localization capabilities if the burst is detected inside the instrument's field of\nview [7].\n\n\f216\n5\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nConclusions\n\nThe Mini-Calorimeter of the AGILE satellite, despite its low weight and power\nbudget, is a powerful and versatile gamma-ray detector in the energy range\n300 keV-200 MeV. The instrument can work both as a slave to the Silicon\nTracker and as an independent detector for gamma-ray transient search. AGILE\nwas launched on 23rd April 2007 and at the time of writing (July 2007) is in\nits commissioning phase. MCAL was switched on in orbit on 2nd May 2007,\nand since then it exhibits nominal behavior.\nReferences\n[1] M.

These features allow ARGO-YBJ to work in the typical energy\nrange of Cherenkov telescopes, with an energy threshold of a few hundreds GeV. The low threshold and the large field of view (\u223c2 sr) make\nARGO-YBJ suitable to monitor the gamma ray sky, searching for unknown sources and unexpected events, like Active Galactic Nuclei flaring\nepisodes or high energy Gamma Ray Bursts.\nIn this paper we present the preliminary results on Gamma Ray Astronomy obtained with the events collected in the first months of data taking,\nin particular the detection of gamma rays from the Crab Nebula, the observation of a Markarian 421 outburst in July-August 2006, and finally\na search for Gamma Ray Bursts emission in the GeV energy range using\nthe scaler mode technique.\n\n1\n\nThe detector\n\nARGO-YBJ is an air shower detector optimized to work with an energy threshold of a few hundreds GeV. It is located at the Yangbajing Cosmic Rays Laboratory (Tibet, China) at an altitude of 4300 m above the sea level.\n217\n\n\f218\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nIt consists of a 74 \u00d7 78 m2 \"carpet\" realized with a single layer of Resistive\nPlate Counters (92% of coverage), operated in streamer mode, surrounded by\na partially instrumented \" sampling ring\", for a total active area of 6700 m2\n(see Fig. 1). The detector is logically divided into 154 clusters, 130 of them\nforming the central carpet and 24 the sampling ring. The cluster, consisting\nof a set of 12 RPCs, is the basic DAQ unit of the detector. Signals from each\nRPCs are picked-up by 10 electrodes of dimension 56 \u00d7 62 cm2 (the \"pads\")\nwhich provide the space-time pattern of the shower front with a time resolution\nof \u223c 1 ns. Each pad is segmented into 8 strips (62 \u00d7 7 cm2 ) which count the\nnumber of particles hitting the pad itself.\nIn order to extend the measurable primary energy range, the RPCs are\nequipped with 2 large size pads (140 \u00d7 125 cm2 ), providing a signal of amplitude\nproportional to the number of particles.\nThe detector will be covered by a 0.5 cm thick layer of lead, in order to\nconvert a fraction of the secondary gamma rays and to reduce the time spread\nof the shower front, increasing the angular resolution.\nARGO-YBJ operates in two independent acquisition modes: the \"shower\nmode\" and the \"scaler mode\".\nIn the \"shower mode\" all showers giving a number of fired pads Npad \u2265\nNtrig in the central carpet during a time window of 420 ns are recorded. The\nspatial coordinates and the time of any fired pad are then used to reconstruct\nthe position of the shower core and the arrival direction of the primary. To\nperform the time calibration of the 18480 pads, a software method had been\ndeveloped[1].\nFig. 1 reports an example of a shower detected by the central carpet,\nshowing the capability of ARGO-YBJ in providing a detailed view of the shower\nfront.\nThe current trigger threshold Ntrig = 20 corresponds to a primary gamma\nenergy threshold of a few hundreds GeV, the exact value depending on the\nsource spectrum and on the zenith angle of observation. With this trigger\ncondition, the event rate is \u223c4 kHz.\nIn the \"scaler mode\" the counting rates of each cluster are recorded every\n0.5 s for 4 different levels of coincidence inside the cluster: \u2265 1, \u2265 2, \u2265 3,\n\u2265 4 pads, with a coincidence time window of 150 ns. The counting rates are\nrespectively \u223c40 kHz, \u223c2 kHz, \u223c300 Hz and \u223c120 Hz per cluster, for the 4\ncoincidence levels.\nThis measurement allows the detection of secondary particles from very\nlow energy showers (E>1 GeV) reaching the ground in a number not sufficient\nto trigger the detector operating in shower mode. In scaler mode the primary\narrival directions are not reconstructed and the data are used to search for transient phenomena as Gamma Ray Bursts or Solar Ground Level Enhancements,\nand to study cosmic ray modulations due to the solar activity.\n\n\fS.

Each point represents a fired pad. Different\ncolours indicate the number of fired strips per pad.\nSince July 2006 the whole central carpet is in data taking. Preliminary\nresults obtained with a subset of the data taken from July 2006 to March 2007\nin shower mode and from December 2004 to March 2007 in scaler mode (with\nthe detector surface increasing from \u223c 700 to \u223c5600 m2 ) are presented.\n2\n\nDetector angular resolution\n\nThe angular resolution has a statistical component, due to the fluctuations of\nthe shower development and of the detector response, and a systematic one,\narising from possible misalignment of the detector or systematic errors in the\nshower reconstruction.\nFig. 2 shows the angular resolution of ARGO-YBJ obtained by a Montecarlo\nsimulation. The figure reports the value of \u03a872 , i.e. the angular difference\nbetween the true direction and the reconstructed one, as a function of the\nnumber of fired pads Npad . \u03a872 is the radius of the circular window around\nthe true direction containing 71.5% of the reconstructed events, which in the\ncase of a gaussian point spread function is the radius of the observation window\naround a point source that maximizes the signal to noise ratio, and it is equal to\n1.58 \u03c3, where \u03c3 is the angular resolution. \u03a872 has been obtained by selecting\nthe events with the reconstructed shower core inside the central carpet, for\nboth primary gamma rays and protons [2].

Fig. 3 shows the opening angle \u03a872 between the two\ndifferent reconstructions as a function of the number of fired pads, compared\nwith Montecarlo expectation. The agreement is excellent (note that the \"evenodd\" angular difference given in Fig. 3 is expected to be a factor \u223c2 larger than\nthe one obtained with the full detector, given in Fig. 2).\nThe \"even-odd\" method allows to check only the statistical component of\nthe angular resolution. To find out possible systematic effects it is common to\nstudy the profile and the position of the shadow that the Moon casts on the\ncosmic ray flux, the strongest \"anti-source\" of the sky.\n\n\fS.

The\ncolour scale shows the significance of\nthe shadow in standard deviations.\nThe axes report the distance in degrees from the Sun position.\n\nThe Moon shadow\n\nThe Moon shadow is an important tool for ground-based detectors. The spread\nand the shape of the shadow at energies where the geomagnetic effect is small,\nprovide a measurement of the angular resolution of the detector, and the position of the shadow allows to find out possible pointing biases.\nTo minimize the effects of the bending of cosmic rays in the geomagnetic\nfield (\u223c 1.6\u25e6 /E(TeV) westward) we consider only the events with Npad \u2265500,\ncorresponding to a median energy of \u223c5 TeV. Fig. 4 shows the significance map\nof the Moon shadow, obtained during 558 hours of observation, selecting the\nevents with zenith angle < 50\u25e6 . A deficit of \u223c10 standard deviations is visible,\nshifted by 0.04\u25e6 toward the West and 0.14\u25e6 toward the North with respect to\nthe nominal Moon position [3].\nThe projection of the deficit along the North-South axis, where the magnetic\ndeflection is expected to be negligible, can be fitted by a Gauss distribution\nwith a width in good agreement with the expected angular resolution.\nUsing a Montecarlo that simulates the path of the cosmic rays in the geomagnetic field, the position of the Moon shadow is expected to be shifted\ntoward the West by \u223c 0.3\u25e6 , due to the magnetic deflection. The observed position of the shadow shows a diplacement of \u223c0.25\u25e6 with respect to the expected\nposition. The systematics causing this shift are currently under investigation.\nAlso the Sun casts a shadow on cosmic rays, but sometimes the effects of\nits highly variable magnetic field are so strong to hamper the observation of\nthe shadow. However in 2006 the solar activity was at its minimum and the\n\n\f222\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 6: Map of the Crab Nebula\nregion.

The Crab is visible with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations.\nIn July-August 2006 the AGN Markarian 421 underwent an active period,\nwith a rather strong increase of the X-ray flux[4]. As observed in many occasions during the past years, the X-ray flux increases are generally associated to\nincreases in the TeV band, that can reach a flux several times larger than the\nCrab Nebula one. The 2006 summer outburst was not observable by Cherenkov\ntelescopes, being the source high in the sky during the daytime.\nARGO-YBJ observed Mrk421 for 80 hours in July and August, during a\ndebugging phase of the detector, just at the end of the installation of the central\ncarpet.\n\n\fS.

A more\naccurate evaluation of the energies is in progress.\nThe position of both the Crab Nebula and Mrk421 signals appears slightly\nshifted eastward with respect to the sources nominal position. The causes of\nthis shift are under study.\n5\n\nGamma Ray Bursts\n\nThe scaler mode technique offers a unique tool to study GRBs in the GeV\nenergy range, where gamma rays are less affected by the absorption due to pair\nproduction in the extragalactic space[5].\nThe search has been done in coincidence with 26 GRBs detected by satellites\n(mainly by Swift). No excess has been found neither in coincidence with the\nlow energy detection, nor in an interval of 2 hours around it [6].\nFig. 8 shows the fluence upper limits for the 26 GRBs in the energy range 1100 GeV during the satellite time detection, as a function of the zenith angle,\nobtained assuming a power law spectrum with an index \u03b1=-2.5.

In some cases the limits are less than 10 GeV.\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nThe central carpet of ARGO-YBJ has been installed and is taking data since\nJuly 2006. The data recorded in the first months of measurement have been\nanalyzed in order to test the performance of the detector in the gamma ray\nastronomy field. The detection of the Moon and Sun shadows, together with a\npreliminary observation of a gamma ray flux from the Crab Nebula and Mrk421,\nshow that the detector is properly working, with excellent angular resolution\nand sensitivity.\nWorking in \"scaler mode\" ARGO-YBJ has also performed a search for\nemission from GRBs in coincidence with 26 events observed by satellites, setting\nupper limits on the fluence between 6 \u00d7 10\u22126 and 2 \u00d7 10\u22122 erg cm\u22122 in the\n1-100 GeV energy range.\nA further increase of the sensitivity to gamma rays is expected with the\ninstallation of a converter layer of lead above the detector, and after the implementation of an offline procedure to reject a fraction of the cosmic ray background, based on the different topological pattern of hadronic and electromagnetic showers.\nReferences\n[1] H.H.

The status of\nthe detector and its present performance are discussed, in connection\nwith the first results of the experiment in cosmic-ray astrophysics.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe ARGO-YBJ experiment was designed to study some major topics in astroparticle physics, and in particular:\n\u2022 search for point-like \u03b3-ray sources at a lower energy threshold of few\nhundreds of GeV;\n\u2022 detection of \u03b3-ray bursts;\n\u2022 measurement of the p\u0304/p ratio at \u223c 1 TeV energy;\n\u2022 measurement of the cosmic-ray spectrum and composition close to the\n\"knee\".\n225\n\n\f226\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nGround-based experiments aiming at performing precise measurements on\nthe above-mentioned items must determine the arrival direction of primary cosmic rays at Earth. This is mainly dealt with by two different techniques: planar\narrays for reconstructing the fronts of the extensive air showers produced by\nthe incoming primaries, and air-Cherenkov telescopes detecting the Cherenkov\nlight emitted by air showers. The ARGO-YBJ experiment [1] is based on a fullcoverage planar array at high altitude, in order to lower the primary energy\nthreshold with respect to standard grid arrays down to a few hundreds of GeV\nfor gamma-initiated showers, and cover a dynamical range from few hundreds\nof GeV up to more than 1 PeV. The full-coverage technique is presently also being exploited by the Milagro experiment [2], which reconstructs the air-shower\nfronts using the Cherenkov-light emission in water of the incoming secondaries.\nThe full-coverage technique allows continuous monitoring of a \u223c 2-sr angular\nsector of the sky.\nHere the ARGO-YBJ detector layout and performance are described. In\naddition, the preliminary results obtained by the experiment on a few important\nissues in cosmic-ray astrophysics are reported.\n2\n\nThe ARGO-YBJ detector\n\nThe ARGO-YBJ experiment is located at Yang Ba Jing (China), at 4300 m\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\na.s.l. on the Tibet plateau (90\u25e6 31 50 E; 30\u25e6 06 38 N). The experiment was\ndesigned so that the following requests were fulfilled:\n\u2022 high altitude, closer to the shower maximum where the shower front is\ndenser, allowing more precise reconstruction of the primary arrival direction;\n\u2022 full coverage, so that smaller showers can be detected and a lower energy\nthreshold can be reached.\nThe ARGO-YBJ detector is a full-coverage array of resistive plate chambers\n(RPCs) operated in streamer mode [3]. The sensitive part of the ARGO-YBJ\nRPCs is a 2-mm wide gas volume made of two 2-mm thick plastic-laminate\nresistive plates (\u03c1 \u223c 1012 \u03a9*cm). The RPCs operate in streamer mode with\na 3-component gas mixture (C2 H2 F4 /Ar/iC4 H10 =75/15/10). The outer faces\nof the plates are painted with a thin graphite layer, so that the electric field\nacross the gap is obtained by applying a 7.2 kV voltage and capacitive read-out\nmetal strips (62 \u00d7 7 cm2 each) pick up the detector signal across the electrodes.\nIn addition, two metal big pads pick up the analog signal on the opposite side\nof the gas volume. These additional pads are needed to extend the dynamical\nrange of the detector up to few PeV, since the digital information coming\nfrom the read-out strips is saturated at energies & 100 TeV. A sketch of the\ntransverse section of an ARGO-YBJ RPC is shown in Fig. 1. Twenty-four\n\n\fP.

Each RPC has a surface of 1.26 \u00d7 2.85 m2 . The RPCs\nin the central carpet (78 \u00d7 74 m2 ) are arranged in a full-coverage array. A\ngroup of 12 close chambers is called a cluster (7.64 \u00d7 5.72 m2 ), and the logical\nacquisition unit is a group of 8 adjacent read-out strips in a chamber, called a\npad (0.62 \u00d7 0.56 m2 ). The 130 clusters of the central full-coverage array have\nbeen taking data since July 2006.\nThe front-end electronics of the ARGO-YBJ RPCs [4] is based on a fullcustom GaAs circuit.

So, the ARGO-YBJ RPCs\nprovide single-pad time information with a 1-ns time resolution and a total\ndissipated power less than 5 kW on a \u223c 104 m2 surface.\nThe ARGO-YBJ acquisition hardware and the trigger algorithm have already been described in other papers [5].\nAn example of a partially-contained shower detected in the ARGO-YBJ\ncentral carpet is shown in Fig. 4.\nThe monitoring data [6] show a good distribution for the current absorbed\nby the chambers, as shown in Fig. 5, with a mean value of about 3 \u03bcA. A\nmore detailed study shows a good linear correlation between the RPC absorbed current and the local temperature if a suitable time delay is accounted\nfor, as shown in Fig. 6. This kind of studies provides better understanding\nof the detector operation in the particular environmental conditions of the experimental site, and the increasing expertise coming from this will be used to\nkeep the ARGO-YBJ detector operating in a stable and reliable way in the\nforthcoming years.\n\n\fP.

Camarri\n\n3\n\nARGO-YBJ: present status and first investigations\n\n231\n\nFirst results in cosmic-ray astrophysics\n\nThe preliminary results from ARGO-YBJ concerning the detection of \u03b3 rays\nfrom the Crab Nebula and from MRK 421 during its July 2006 flare were reported separately in this Workshop [7]. Here we will summarize the results\nof other important studies performed by the collaboration in cosmic-ray astrophysics.\nA crucial investigation concerns the features of the shower fronts [8]. Two\nparameters can be measured: the curvature, which is the mean value of the\ntime residuals with respect to a planar fit of the shower front; the thickness,\nwhich is the RMS of the residuals with respect to a conical fit (see Fig. 7).\nThe experimental results for these two parameters as a function of the distance\nfrom the shower core for three different pad-multiplicity ranges (corresponding\nto three different mean primary energies) are shown in Fig. 8. The events were\nselected with a zenith angle less than 15\u25e6 . A detailed Monte Carlo simulation\nshows that these parameters may be crucial to perform \u03b3-hadron separation on\na statistical basis.\nAnother study in progress is the measurement of the proton-air inelastic\ncross section at energy greater than 1 TeV [9]. For a given pad-multiplicity interval (corresponding to a given mean primary energy) the frequency of showers\nas a function of the zenith angle \u03b8 (for a fixed distance XDM between the detector and the shower maximum) is related to the probability distribution of the\ndepth of the shower maximum P (Xmax ), with Xmax = h0 sec \u03b8 \u2212 XDM , where\nh0 is the observational vertical depth. For large Xmax values, P (Xmax ) has\na decreasing exponential behaviour with attenuation length \u039b = \u03ba\u03bbp , where\n\u03ba (to be evaluated with a Monte Carlo simulation) is an adimensional parameter depending on the shower development and the detector response, and\n\u03bbp (g/cm2 ) \u2243 2.41 * 104 /\u03c3p\u2212Air (mb). In order to select showers from primaries\ninteracting deeper in the atmosphere, it was required that 70% of the fired\nstrips were contained within 25 m from the reconstructed shower core. This\nevent selection is independent of shower fluctuations for \u03b8 < 40\u25e6 , which is also\nthe applied cut for the selected events. The experimental sec \u03b8 \u2212 1 distributions for pad-multiplicity ranges 300 6 Npad 6 1000 (corresponding to a mean\nprimary energy of (3.9\u00b10.1) TeV) and Npad > 1000 (corresponding to a mean\nprimary energy of (12.7\u00b10.4) TeV) are shown in Fig. 9 (upper and lower plot\nrespectively). From these plots the values of \u03ba can be obtained by comparison\nwith the Monte Carlo simulation. The result for \u03c3p\u2212Air , after correcting for\nthe contribution of primaries heavier than protons, is (275 \u00b1 51) mb for the\nlower multiplicity range and (282 \u00b1 31) mb for the upper one. These values\nare in good agreement with the results of other experiments. The possibility\nof performing a measurement of \u03c3p\u2212Air at energy \u223c1 PeV with a suitable selection of the shower development stage, also using the RPC analog read-out\nsystem, is being considered.\n\n\f232\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 7: Scheme of the transverse view of an air-shower front hitting the\nARGO-YBJ detector.

The first studies in \u03b3-ray and\ncosmic-ray astronomy are giving excellent results and providing a good amount\nof information. The constant monitoring of the environmental and operational\nparameters is giving a better understanding of the detector and of the conditions which are needed in order to keep the operation stable for a long time.\nBefore the end of 2007 the complete detector will be working, including the\nguard-ring clusters. The installation of the analog read-out system on all the\nclusters will be crucial to investigate the energy range from few hundreds of\nGeV up to few PeV.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.

In this work we perform an analysis\nof the prospects for indirect detection of these objects with GLAST-like\nexperiments, exploring different prescriptions for the subhalos shape parameters currently allowed by numerical simulations. Our results confirm\nthat while subhalos may contribute significantly to the diffuse Galactic\nannihilation signal, the possibility of detecting a single halo is very small,\nand it is restricted to high mass halos.\n\n235\n\n\f236\n1\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe present-day description of the universe includes 26 % of cold dark matter\n(CDM), whose nature and distribution is unknown [1]. No dark matter (DM)\nparticle has been observed so far, although hypotheses have been done on\nweakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) coming from Supersymmetry or\nUniversal Extra Dimension theories. The distribution of DM inside the halos\nis uncertain too. The smooth radial DM distribution is poorly constrained in\nthe innermost regions around the halo center, where neither experiments nor\nnumerical simulations have enough resolution to allow any conclusive modeling.\nThe NFW density profile [2] is usually found to be consistent with numerical\nsimulations. Extrapolated at small distances from the halo center, it predicts\na \u03c1(r) \u221d r\u22121 behaviour.\nIn the hierarchical formation scheme of the CDM scenario, large systems as\nour Milky Way are the result of the merging and accretion of highly concentrated subhalos, the smallest of which ever accreted onto the present day halo\nhave a mass of 10\u22126 M\u2299 , if the DM particle is a WIMP. In such dense areas, the\nDM annihilation into standard model particles is expected to give the bigger\ncontibution.\nReferences and further details can be found in [3]. In this paper we derive a\nprediction for the expected \u03b3-ray flux deriving from the population of subhalos\ninside the MW, and we study its probability to be detected with a GLASTlike experiment. We assume different models for the subhalo concentration\nparameter, which result in more or less concentrated NFW subhalos.\n2\n\n\u03b3-ray flux from subhalos\n\nThe \u03b3-ray annihilation flux can be generally written as \u03a6\u03b3 = \u03a6PP \u00d7 \u03a6cosmo ,\nwhich factorizes the particle physics and cosmological contributions.

The resulting flux is then normalized not to exceed the\nEGRET extragalactic background far from the Galactic plane.\nTen Monte Carlo realizations of the closest and brightest subhalos have\nbeen realized in order to study the possibility of detecting an annihilation flux\nfrom a resolved subhalo.\nAs already pointed out in the Introduction, the c(M, z) relation is not well\nestablished. We have used the following 6 different models when deriving the\nflux predictions for both the diffuse and the resolved halo flux:\nBz0 uses c(M, z = 0) as computed in [7], extrapolated to c(M = 10\u22126 M\u2299 , z =\n0) = 80 [8]\nBz0 ,5\u03c3 uses c(M, z = 0) as computed in [7], extrapolated to c(M = 10\u22126 M\u2299 , z =\n0) = 400, corresponding to a 5 \u03c3 density peak fluctuation.\nBzf as Bz0 but computed at the collapse redshift as derived from [7], extrapolated to zf (M = 10\u22126 M\u2299 ) = 70 [8] through the relation c(M, z = 0) =\n(1 + zf ) \u00d7 c(M, zf )\nBzf ,5\u03c3 as Bz0 ,5\u03c3 but computed at the collapse redshift\n\n\f238\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nENSz0 as Bz0 but with c(M, z = 0) computed according to [9].\nENSzf as Bzf but with c(M, z = 0) computed according to [9].\nThe c(M, z = 0) curves are shown in the upper panel of Fig.1. Further details\nand a more complete set of models can be found in [6].\n3\n\nExperimental sensitivity\n\nWe define the experimental sensitivity \u03c3 as the ratio\nn\u03b3\n\u03c3\u2261 \u221a\nnbkg\nR\n\u221a\nsignal\n/dEd\u03a9]dEd\u03a9\nTobs Aeff\n\u03b3 (E, \u03b8i )[d\u03c6\u03b3\nq\n= RP\neff\nbkg Abkg (E, \u03b8i )[d\u03c6bkg /dEd\u03a9]dEd\u03a9\n\n(5)\n\nHere, Tobs =1 yr, Aeff = 104 cm2 independent from both energy and incident\nangle, and the background is taken from [10] and [11]. The smooth MW and\nsubhalo annihilation foregrounds have been considered as background for the\ndetection of single halos. The lower panel of Fig.1 shows the sensitivity curves\nfor the diffuse subhalo + MW foreground for the models described in Sec.2.\nSuch a signal would be detectable only toward the Galactic Centre for the z = 0\nmodels which are not affected from the normalization imposed by the EGRET\ndata. Unfortunately, the astrophysical uncertainties in modeling the expected\nbackground in that region are very high.\nWe have then computed the 3-\u03c3 detection probability for each one of the\nsimulated halos, as the probability P (c3\u03c3 ) of having a concentration parameter\nc3\u03c3 whose corresponding flux would result in a 3-\u03c3 level detection. The sum\nof the detection probabilities of all the simulated halos gives us the number of\nsubhalos detectable at 3-\u03c3 in 1 yr for the given model. The result is shown in\nFig.2, where the number of detectable halos as a function of the subhalo mass\nis plotted for all the concentration parameter models. The sum of detectable\nhalos integrated over the mass is greater than 1 in all cases but the Bzf ,5\u03c3 and\nENSz0 . Yet, the only detectable subhalos would have a mass greater than\n107 M\u2299 .\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have derived the expected \u03b3-ray flux from the annihilation of DM in galactic subhalos.

One major consequence of such assumptions is\nthe modification of the dispersion relations for electrons/positrons and\nphotons, which in turn can affect the electromagnetic output of astrophysical objects. We consider the information provided by multiwavelength observations versus a full and self-consistent computation of the\nbroad band spectrum of the Crab Nebula. We cast constraints of order\n10\u22125 at 95% confidence level on the lepton Lorentz Violation parameters.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLocal Lorentz invariance (LI) is fundamental to both of the two pillars of our\npresent physical knowledge: the standard model of particle physics and general relativity. Nonetheless the most recent progress in theoretical physics, in\nparticular toward the construction of a theory of Quantum Gravity (QG), has\nled to a new perspective in which both the above mentioned theories are seen\nas effective ones to be replaced by a theory of some more fundamental objects\n243\n\n\f244\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nat high energies. In this perspective it is easy to understand that even spacetime fundamental symmetries (as local LI) could cease to be valid nearby the\nPlanckian regime.\nThis intuition and several other issues of principle (see e.g. [1, 2]) for questioning LI at high energies, have been somewhat strengthened by specific hints\nof Lorentz violation (LV) that have come from tentative calculations in various\napproaches to QG (see [3] for more details).\nIn recent years most efforts for placing constraints on high energy deviations\nfrom LI have focused on modified dispersion relations for elementary particles.\nIn fact, in most QG models LV is expressed through dispersion relations which\ncan be cast in the general form (assuming rotation invariance to be preserved)\nE 2 = p2 + m2 + f (E, p; \u03bc; M ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere c = 1, E, p are the energy and momentum of the particle, \u03bc is some\nparticle physics mass scale (possibly associated with some symmetry breaking/emergence scale) and M denotes the relevant QG scale, which is usually\nassumed to be of order the Planck mass: M \u223c MPl \u2248 1.22 \u00d7 1019 GeV. The\nfunction f (E, p; \u03bc; M ) can be generally expanded in powers of the momentum.\nWe investigate here the model of QED modified by the addition of nonrenormalizable, dimension five, LV operators proposed in [4]. The effect of\nthese extra terms is to modify the dispersion relations for the particles as\nfollows. For the photon we have (the + and - signs denote right and left\n2\n= k 2 \u00b1 \u03bek 3 /M , while for the fermion (with the + and\ncircular polarisation) \u03c9\u00b1\n2\n- signs now denoting positive and negative helicity states) E\u00b1\n= p 2 + m2 +\n3\n\u03b7\u00b1 p /M , with \u03be, \u03b7\u00b1 constant parameters to be constrained. Hence standard\nprocesses (e.g. threshold reactions) are modified and new processes are open\n(e.g. \u010cerenkov emission in vacuum). The energy scale at which those effects\nbecome visible can be estimated as kth \u223c (m2e MPl /\u03b7)1/3 \u2248 10 TeV\u03b7 \u22121/3 [2].\nObservations involving energies of \u223c 10 TeV can potentially cast an O(1)\nconstraint on the above defined coefficients. This is indeed a high energy scale\nbut it is well within the range of the observed phenomena in high energy astrophysics, which provides then the observations so far more effective in casting\nconstraints on our test theory. But what is the theoretically expected value for\nthe LV coefficients? In particular renormalisation group effects could in principle strongly suppress the low energy values of (\u03be, \u03b7\u00b1 ) even if they are O(1) at\nhigh energies. However, according to [3, 5], the running of the LV parameters\nis only logarithmic and, therefore, low energy constraints are robust.\nIn Section 2 we shall review the currents status of the constraints on this test\ntheory, focusing on the role played so far by the Crab Nebula (CN). In Section\n3 the current observations of the CN and their theoretical interpretation will\nbe reviewed, and the role of the departures from LI in our theory will be\ndiscussed. Finally in Section 4 we shall present and discuss the constraints\n\n\fL. Maccione\n\nNew Crab Nebula limits on Planck-scale suppressed LV in QED 245\n\nthat the current observations allow to cast on the theory and the possible\nimprovements expected from future experiments like GLAST.\nThese proceedings refer to the more detailed work [3], to which we point\nthe interested reader.\n2\n\nPrevious astrophysical constraints on QED with O(E/M) LV\n\nThe present status of the astrophysical constraints on our test theory is summarised in figure 1. Since we just sketch here the present status of the field,\nwe point the reader to [2] and [3] for a more detailed discussion.\n\nFigure 1: Present constraints on the LV coefficients for QED with dimension\n5 Lorentz violation. The grey area is the allowed one and within it the region\nbounded by the two dashed vertical lines identifies the allowed range for at\nleast one of the four lepton LV coefficients (assuming that a single population\nhas to be simultaneously responsible for the synchrotron and Inverse Compton\nemission of the CN).\nWhile the natural magnitude of the photon and electron coefficients \u03be, \u03b7\u00b1\nwould be O(1) if there were one power of suppression by the inverse Planck\nmass, the coefficients are currently restricted to the region |\u03be| . 10\u22127 by birefringence [6] and |\u03b7\u00b1 | . 10\u22121 by photon decay [2]. Birefringence is due to the\nfact that the LV coefficients for right and left circularly polarised photons are\nopposite, hence the linear polarisation of a photon is spoiled after long distance\npropagation, while the photon decay \u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 is allowed in our test theory\nbecause the photon energy-momentum 4-vector is not null [2]. In the same\n\n\f246\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nway, in this theory also the emission of \u010cerenkov radiation in vacuum (VC)\ne \u2192 e\u03b3 by a superluminal charged particle is possible.\nHowever, whereas the constraint on the photon coefficient is remarkably\nstrong, the same cannot be said about the LV coefficients of leptons. A constraint on the lepton coefficients of comparable strength is given by the synchrotron limit found in [2], but this is not double sided and implies only that the\nLV coefficient of the population responsible for the CN synchrotron emission\ncannot be smaller than \u22128 \u00d7 10\u22127 . Similarly the VC-IC bound \u03b7 < +3 \u00d7 10\u22123\n[2] constrains only one lepton population. These statements cannot be considered constraints on \u03b7\u00b1 , since for each of them one of the two parameters \u00b1\u03b7+\n(and \u00b1\u03b7\u2212 ) will always satisfy the bound.\nIt is clear however that these simple arguments do not fully exploit the\navailable astrophysical information. A detailed comparison of the observations\nwith the reconstructed spectrum in the LV case, where all reactions and modifications of classical processes are considered, can provide us with constraints\non both positive and negative \u03b7, at levels comparable to those already obtained\nfor the photon LV coefficient. We then move to reconsider such information\nconcerning the astrophysical object that so far has proven most effective in\ncasting constraints on the electron/positrons LV coefficients: the Crab Nebula.\n3\n\nThe Crab Nebula\n\nThe CN is a source of diffuse radio, optical and X-ray radiation associated\nwith a Supernova explosion observed in 1054 A.D. Its distance from Earth is\nabout 1.9 kpc. A pulsar, presumably a remnant of the explosion, is located\nat the centre of the Nebula. It is thought to provide the Nebula with both\nthe radiating particles and a magnetic field, and powers it with part of its\nspin-down luminosity of about 5 \u00d7 1038 erg/s (for a recent review see [9]).\nThe Nebula emits an extremely broad-band spectrum (21 decades in frequency, see [3] for a comprehensive list of relevant observations), produced by\ntwo major radiation mechanisms that are related to the interactions of relativistic electrons with the ambient magnetic and radiation fields. The emission\nfrom radio to low energy \u03b3-rays (E < 1 GeV) is thought to be synchrotron\nradiation from relativistic electrons, whereas IC scattering by these electrons is\nthe favoured explanation for the higher energy \u03b3-rays. The clear synchrotron\nnature of the non-thermal radiation from radio to low energy \u03b3-rays, combined\nwith a magnetic field strength of the order of B \u2248 100 \u03bcG implies, when exact\nLorentz invariance is assumed, the presence of relativistic electrons with energies up to 1016 eV. The gyro period of these electrons is roughly equal to the\ntimescale on which they lose energy by synchrotron, implying an acceleration\nrate close to the maximum estimated for shock-based mechanisms (e.g. [10]).\nHowever, though the maximum energy of the electrons is model dependent,\n\n\fL. Maccione\n\nNew Crab Nebula limits on Planck-scale suppressed LV in QED 247\n\nthe fact that photons with E >\n\u223c 10 TeV have been detected from the CN is an\nunambiguous evidence of effective acceleration of particles beyond 100 TeV.\nLet us stress that this statement has to be considered robust also in our test\ntheory, given that in this case energy-momentum conservation still holds.\nFrom the theoretical point of view, the CN is one of the most studied\nobjects. The current understanding of the whole environment is based on a\nspherically symmetric magneto-hydro-dynamics model presented in two seminal papers by Kennel & Coroniti [11], that accounts for the general features\nseen in the CN spectrum. We point the reader to [3] for a wider discussion of\nthis model.\nBecause we consider a LV version of electrodynamics, it is interesting to\nstudy whether this introduces modifications into the model of the CN and, if\nso, what effects it produces. We now show how the processes at work in the\nCN would appear in a \"LV world\".\nFermi mechanism Several mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of the spectrum of energetic electrons in the CN. As discussed in\n[3], the power-law spectrum of high energy (> 1 TeV) particles is usually interpreted as due to first order Fermi mechanism operating at the\nultra-relativistic termination shock front of the pulsar wind, since, in the\nsimplest kinematic picture, this mechanism predicts a power law index of\njust the right value [9]. In [3] the possible modifications occurring to the\nFermi mechanism due to LV have been discussed, including the interpretation of the high energy cut-off. In summary, if we phenomenologically\nmodel the cut-off at Ec as an exponential, from the Fermi mechanism we\nexpect a particle spectrum in the high energy region E > 1 TeV, of the\nform n(E) \u221d \u03b3(E)\u2212p e\u2212E/Ec with p \u2248 2.4 and Ec \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 1015 eV. Then,\nwe can safely deal with the electron/positron distributions inferred by\n[12], paying attention to replace the energy with the Lorentz boost factor\nin the expressions given by [12].\nRole of VC emission In presence of LV the process of VC radiation can\noccur. Taking \u03be \u2243 0 (see [6]), the threshold energy is given by pVC =\n(m2e M/2\u03b7)1/3 \u2243 11 TeV \u03b7 \u22121/3 . Just above threshold, this process has a\ntime scale of order 10\u22129 s, so it is extremely efficient. The VC emission,\ndue to its extreme rapidity above threshold, can produce a sharp cut-off\nin the acceleration spectrum. It can be verified that the modifications\nin the optical/UV spectrum produced by the VC radiation emitted by\nparticles above threshold are negligible with respect to the synchrotron\nemission.\nRole of Helicity Decay (HD) If \u03b7+ 6= \u03b7\u2212 , leptons can flip their helicities by\nemitting a suitably polarised photon. In order to understand whether the\nHD is effective, its typical time scale \u03c4HD \u223c 10\u22129 s \u00d7 \u2206\u03b7 \u22123 (p/10 TeV)\u22128\n\n\f248\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nhas to be compared with that of the spin precession of a particle moving\nin a magnetic field. The spin rotation will effectively prevent the helicity\ndecay if the precession rate is faster than the time needed for HD. Therefore, we can estimate that the HD will become effective when the particle\n(eff)\n1/8\n\u22123/8\n. Electrons and\nenergy is above pHD >\n\u223c 930 GeV (B/0.3 mG) |\u2206\u03b7|\n(eff)\npositrons with E > pHD can be found only in the helicity state corresponding to the lowest value of \u03b7\u00b1 . Hence, the population of greater \u03b7\nwill be sharply cut off above threshold while the other will be increased.\nSynchrotron radiation Synchrotron radiation by leptons cycling in a magnetic field is strongly affected by LV. In the LI case, as well as in the LV\none [2], most of the radiation from an electron of energy E is emitted\naround a critical frequency \u03c9c = 1.5 eB\u03b3 3(E)/E. In the LV case, the\nelectron group velocity is given by v(E) \u2243 1 \u2212 m2e /2E + \u03b7E/M . This introduces a fundamental difference between particles with positive or negative LV coefficient \u03b7. If \u03b7 is negative the group velocity of the electrons\nis strictly less than the (low energy) speed of light. This implies that, at\nsufficiently high energy, \u03b3(E)\u2212 < E/me , for all E. As a consequence, the\ncritical frequency \u03c9c\u2212 (\u03b3, E) is always less than a maximal frequency \u03c9cmax\n[2]. Then, if synchrotron emission up to some frequency \u03c9obs is observed,\none can deduce that the LV coefficient for the corresponding leptons cannot be more negative than the value for which \u03c9cmax = \u03c9obs . On the\nother hand, particles with positive LV coefficient can be superluminal\n1/3\nand therefore, at energies Ec >\n\u223c 8 TeV/\u03b7 , \u03b3(E) starts to increase more\nthan E/me and reaches infinity at a finite energy which corresponds to\nthe threshold for soft VC emission. Therefore, also the critical frequency\nwill be larger than the LI one and the spectrum will show a characteristic\nbump due to the enhanced \u03c9c . Finally, it has been checked [3] that the\nmodified energy loss rate does not affect the acceleration spectrum.\n4\n\nConstraints\n\nUsing the numerical tools developed in [3], we are able to study the effect of\nLV on the CN spectrum. The procedure requires first to fix most of the model\nparameters using radio to soft X-rays observations, which are not affected by\nLV [3]. The high energy cut-off of the wind lepton spectrum Ec \u2243 2.5 PeV and\na spectral index of the freshly accelerated electrons p = 2.4 give the best fit to\nthe data in the LI case [12].\nIt is clear that only two configurations in the LV parameter space are really\ndifferent: \u03b7+ * \u03b7\u2212 > 0 and \u03b7+ * \u03b7\u2212 < 0, with \u03b7+ assumed to be positive for\ndefiniteness. In fact, the one with both \u03b7\u00b1 negative is the same as the (\u03b7+ *\u03b7\u2212 >\n0, \u03b7+ > 0) case, while that with the signs scrambled is equivalent to the case\n\n\fNew Crab Nebula limits on Planck-scale suppressed LV in QED 249\n\nL.

According to [3] it is possible\nto conclude that the LV parameters for the leptons are both constrained, at\n95% CL, to be |\u03b7\u00b1 | < 10\u22125 .\nAlthough the best fit model is not the LI one, a careful statistical analysis\nshows that the best fit is statistically indistinguishable (with present day data)\nfrom the LI one at 95% CL [3].\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have shown how relaxing the LI assumption (within the framework set\nup in [4]) reflects into the electromagnetic output of astrophysical sources. We\nreproduced the observed synchrotron spectrum starting from the most accurate\ntheoretical model of the CN [12], but taking into account the LV contributions\nof all the electron/positron populations and reconsidering all our LI \"biases\".\nIn this way both \u03b7\u00b1 can be constrained to limits at |\u03b7\u00b1 | < 10\u22126 and |\u03b7\u00b1 | <\n10\u22125 at 90% and 95% CL respectively, by comparing the simulated spectra\nto the observational results. A significant step forward could be taken when\nthe GLAST [13] observatory will be flying. An order of magnitude estimate of\nthe improvement can be obtained considering its exposure, which is 30 times\nlarger that EGRET's one. Therefore, assuming that GLAST will observe the\n\n\f250\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nCN at least as long as EGRET did, we can estimate that the errors associated\nwith measurements in the 10 MeV-500 MeV band will be lowered by roughly\na factor of 5 (statistical). Then, a constraint of order 10\u22126 at 99% CL (10\u22127\nat 95% CL) is realistic. Moreover, GLAST should permit to disentangle the LI\nmodel from the best fit LV one found in [3].\nReferences\n[1] D. Mattingly, Living Rev. Rel. 8, 5 (2005)\n[2] T. Jacobson, S. Liberati and D.

The emission is (7.3 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b1 2.3) \u00d7 10\u221211 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 for E > 3.5 TeV in the\n251\n\n\f252\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nregion 40o < l < 100o [1]. Recently [2] have argued that no strong signal of pion\ndecay is seen in the \u03b3-ray spectrum, and therefore the pion decay mechanism\nwould not be able to explain the excess above 1 GeV measured by the EGRET\nexperiment [3]. Therefore, [2] claimed that the Milagro measurements of the\ndiffuse flux at higher energies revealed a new excess at TeV energies. [2] investigated several possibilities for what might cause the TeV excess, among them\npossible dark matter decay, contribution from unresolved EGRET sources or\nsources that are only bright in the TeV range. An extrapolation of the EGRET\nsources within the range in Galactic longitude of the Milagro observation overestimates the diffuse TeV flux measured. However, there could be a population\nof sources undetectable by EGRET, but contributing to both the GeV and TeV\nexcess diffuse emission. Recent observations by the TeV observatory, HESS, in\nfact point to a new class of hard spectrum TeV sources, whose average slope\nis about E \u22122.3 . The HESS detection of high energy \u03b3 rays from fourteen new\nsources has improved significantly the knowledge of both the spatial distribution and the spectra and fluxes of VHE \u03b3-ray galactic sources [4, 5]. These\nHESS results make it possible to estimate with unprecedented precision the\ncontribution of unresolved sources to the Galactic diffuse emission recently extended to TeV energies by Milagro. Here, based on HESS results, knowing the\nsensitivity and the field of view of an experiment, we estimate the number of\nexpected sources and their expected VHE \u03b3-ray flux. We then evaluate the\ncontribution of unresolved sources to the diffuse \u03b3-ray emission for Milagro [6].\nThe new results obtained by Milagro during the scan of the Galactic Plane\nconfirm our predictions [7, 9].\n2\n\nNumber-intensity relation for HESS sources\n\nIn order to perform a study of the collective properties of HESS source population the number-intensity relation, logN (> S) \u2212 logS, is here used. The\nnumber-intensity relation has the advantage of using the flux data without any\nassumption on the distance and luminosity. In fact for many of HESS sources\nthe location and luminosity are unknown. The major difficulties in the study\nof the collective properties of the HESS source population consist of the limited\nnumber of sources detected and the relatively small range of flux covered by the\nsurvey. Also, the HESS survey of the Galaxy was not performed with uniform\nsensitivity. In fact, whereas the sensitivity of the survey of the Galactic Plane\nin Galactic latitude is rather flat in the region between -1.5 and 1.5 degrees,\nits effective exposure and therefore its sensitivity is not uniform in longitude.\nLonger observation times were dedicated by HESS to locations in the Galactic\nplane close to where three sources, HESS J1747-218 and HESS J1745-290 (in\nthe Galactic Center), and HESS J1713-397, were already known. The average\nsensitivity of the survey as a function of the longitude and the latitude are\n\n\fSabrina Casanova, Brenda Dingus\n\n253\n\nshown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 of [5], respectively. In some locations of the Galaxy\nthe survey was done at peak sensitivity of 2 per cent of the Crab flux. From\nFig. 3 of [5] one can deduce that in order for our sample to be complete, only\nsources detected with more than 6 per cent the Crab flux within \u22122o < l < 2o\ncan be included.\nThe number-intensity relation for the HESS sample of sources with integral\nfluxes bigger than S1 = 12 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm2 s\u22121 , which corresponds to 6 per cent of\nthe Crab flux, is\nS (\u22121.0\u00b10.1)\nN (> S) = (152 \u00b1 41) ( )\n(1)\nS0\nwhere S0 = 10\u221212 cm2 s\u22121 with reduced \u03c7 = 0.5. The HESS-like sources are\ndistributed in a thin disk, in a volume that is larger than the visibility limit.\nThe \u03b3-ray flux due to the HESS source population above 6 per cent of the Crab\nflux in the region \u221230o < l < 30o and \u22122o < l < 2o is\nF (E > 200GeV ) =\n\nZ\n\nS2\n\nS1\n\nN (> S) dS = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere S2 = 57.8 \u00d7 10\u221212 cm2 s\u22121 is the maximum flux detected by HESS from\na source.\nFor only a few of HESS sources a firm identification with counterparts at\nother wavelengths exists. Though there are some suggestions that many of the\nHESS sources might coincide with supernova remnants (SNRs) or pulsar wind\nnebulae (PWNe). In fact two of the HESS sources have SNRs as counterparts,\nand five of these most recently discovered HESS sources are associated with\npulsar wind nebulae [10]. SNRs are an established source class in VHE \u03b3\nray astronomy [11, 12, 13, 14]. PWNe formed from young pulsars with age\nless than a million years are considered as potential gamma-ray emitters [15].\nThough a young age is not a sufficient condition for a pulsar to generate a\nPWN. The spin-down energy loss is the key parameter to determine whether\na young energetic pulsar forms a PWN [16]. The ratio between \u03b3-ray loud\nversus \u03b3-ray quiet pulsars is uncertain. [16] suggests that all pulsars with\ndE/dt > dE/dtc = 3.4 \u00d7 1036 erg/s are X-ray bright, manifest a distinct pulsar\nwind nebula (PWN), and are associated with a supernova event. By studying\nthe Chandra data on the 28 most energetic pulsars of the Parkes Multibeam\nPulsar Survey [15] [17] found that 15 pulsars with \u0116 > 3.4 \u00d7 1036 ergs/s are\nX-ray bright, show a resolved PWN, and are associated with evidence of a\nsupernova event. This means that about 2.5 per cent of the radio loud pulsar\nhave a PWN and might emit \u03b3-rays.\nFrom the distributions of Galactic PSRs and SNRs there are 88 SNRs and\n5324 PRSs in the region \u221230o < l < 30o and \u22122o < b < 2o , whereas in\nthe Milagro region (40o < l < 100o and \u22125o < b < 5o ) there are 41 SNRs\n\n\f254\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nand 1358 PSRs. Assuming that supernova remnants and pulsars are the radio\ncounterparts of high energy gamma ray sources, SNRs and PWNe, the Milagro\nregion has 26 percent of the sources which are in the HESS region. Also, the\nMilagro Galactic diffuse emission is measured for a threshold energy of about\n3.5 TeV, whereas the flux from unresolved sources calculated in Eq.(2) refers to\nthe HESS threshold energy of 200 GeV. In order to estimate the contribution\nof unresolved sources to Milagro diffuse emission the flux in Eq.(2) has to be\ncorrected for the different threshold energy. All HESS sources are fitted by a\n\u2212\u0393\npower law spectrum \u03a6(E, \u0393) = \u03a60 ( 1TEeV )\nand the average spectral index is\n\u0393 = 2.32. By correcting the flux in Eq.(2) for the Milagro threshold energy the\nflux which HESS-like sources contribute is\nF (E > 3.5 T eV, 40 < l < 100, \u22125 < b < 5) = 8.3\u00d710\u221212 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 .\n(3)\nThe contribution of HESS source population amounts to 10 per cent of the\ndiffuse flux which Milagro measures above 3.5 TeV. This is a lower limit for the\ncontribution of unresolved sources to Milagro diffuse emission, as only sources\nabove 6 percent of the Crab flux were taken into account to estimate it.\nThe Galactic diffuse emission measured by Milagro can be used to constrain\nthe minimum flux Smin below which the logN-logS plot becomes flat in order\nnot to overproduce the Milagro flux\nZ\n\nS2\n\ndS\nSmin\n\ndN\n< 7.3 \u00d7 10\u221211 photons s\u22121 sr\u22121 cm\u22122 .\ndS\n\n(4)\n\nSmin cannot be less than 1\u00d710\u221216 photons s\u22121 sr\u22121 cm\u22122 in order not to violate\nthe constraint in Eq.(4).\nFrom the number-intensity relation for HESS source population it is possible\nto deduce the number of sources which HESS, VERITAS, Milagro and HAWC\nwill detect. The number of SNRs and PWNs expected for HESS if its entire\nfield of view is scanned with a uniform sensitivity of 2 per cent of the Crab\nflux above 200 GeV is about 43 \u00b1 10. If VERITAS will survey the Northern\nsky reaching the level of 1 per cent of the Crab flux above 100 GeV, it should\ndetect approximately 18 \u00b1 4. For small fields of view experiments such as HESS\nand VERITAS the complete survey of the sky at the quoted sensitivity requires\nyears of operation.\nMilagro has been observing the Northern sky with a sensitivity equal to\nabout 65 per cent the Crab flux at 3.5 TeV. At this level of sensitivity one\nshould expect no detection of sources for Milagro and indeed no detection of\nsources was claimed in [1] with the data accumulated after the first three years\nof operation. Now after six years of data have been accumulated Milagro has\nreached a sensitivity equal to about 10 per cent of the Crab flux at 12 TeV\nmedian energy and should be able to detect 5 \u00b1 1 sources. The proposed\n\n\f255\n\nSabrina Casanova, Brenda Dingus\n\nexperiment HAWC after only one year of operation will have surveyed the\nNorthern sky at 50mCrab sensitivity above 1 TeV and should have detected\n5 \u00b1 1 HESS-like SNRs and PWNe. Compared to the Milagro experiment which\nhad no detection for the first three years of data the expectations of detection of\nSNRs and PWNe at VHE energy for HAWC after two/three years of operation\nare extremely promising.\n\nNumber (> Flux)\n\n100\n\nHESS sources above 6 % Crab\n-1.0\nfitting curve S\n\n10\n\n1\n\n0.1\n10\n\n100\n-12\n\nFlux (E>200 GeV) (10\n\n-2 -1\n\ncm s )\n\nFigure 1: The number-intensity relation, logN (> S) \u2212 logS, for HESS source\npopulation. In order to have a complete sample, only sources detected above 6\nper cent of the Crab flux are included. The population of sources is distributed\nin a thin disk.\n\n3\n\nAlternative method to estimate the contribution of unresolved\nsources to the diffuse emission\n\nThanks to the logN-logS relation we obtained a lower limit for the contribution\nof unresolved HESS-like sources to the diffuse emission measured by Milagro.\nHere we will assume the density of VHE \u03b3-ray source candidates, SNRs and\nPWNe, follows the volume density of SNRs or of pulsars in the Galactic Plane\nas observed at radio wavelengths and we will then estimate their contribution\n\n\f256\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nto the Milagro diffuse emission.\nSince the data on HESS sources are too sparse to constrain their luminosity\nfunction, we will leave it as a parametrised input. The luminosity function\n\u03a6(L) will be a power law with different indices \u03b1 varying between -1 and -2\n\u03a6(L) =\n\ndN\nL\u03b3 \u03b1\n= c(\n) .\ndL\u03b3\nL\u03b3 0\n\n(5)\n\nThe assumed luminosity function will then be compared with the HESS source\ncounts to fix the normalisation c. In Eq.(5) L\u03b3 0 = 1 \u00d7 1034 erg/s.\nThe range in luminosities for the HESS sources, for which the distance and\nthus the luminosity is known, varies between 1031 erg/s and 1036 erg/s. In fact,\nmost sources of \u03b3-ray in the Galaxy are located close to the plane of the Galaxy,\nwithin a region which extends from Dmin = 0.3 kpc up to Dmax = 30 kpc\n[18]. The range in luminosity for the HESS sample can then be found from the\nHESS sensitivity (we assume 6 percent of the Crab flux) and the maximum flux\n\u0393\u22121\nEth 4 \u03c0 Dmin 2 fmin =\ndetected by HESS, which are respectively L\u03b3 min = \u0393\u22122\n2\n\u0393\u22121\n31\n3 \u00d7 10 erg/s and L\u03b3 max = \u0393\u22122 Eth 4 \u03c0 Dmax fmax = 1 \u00d7 1036 erg/s, where\nEth is the detector threshold energy and \u0393 is the spectral index if the \u03b3-ray\nemission is a power law.\nThat HESS detects above 6 percent of the Crab flux constrains the normalisation factor c. If the slope of the luminosity function is \u03b1 = \u22121.5,\nthe integral flux above 3.5 TeV due to HESS-like SNRs and PWNe is 7 \u00d7\n10\u221211 photons s\u22121 cm\u22122 sr\u22121 , which is comparable to the diffuse emission itself\nassuming a slope \u03b1 = \u22121. If the slope of the luminosity function \u03b1 = \u22121.5\nthe contribution of SNRs and PWNe to the diffuse emission measured by Milagro is about 5 percent and for \u03b1 = \u22122 this contribution becomes negligible,\nwhich is in disagreement with the lower limit of 10 percent for the contribution of HESS-like sources to the VHE diffuse emission previously found. Thus\nthe slope of the luminosity function for HESS-like sources is constrained to be\n\u22121 > \u03b1 > \u22121.5.\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe number-intensity relation and the luminosity function for the HESS source\npopulation were investigated using the assumption that HESS sources are distributed as PSRs and SNRs detected at radio wavelengths. In order for the\nchosen sample of sources to be complete only the HESS sources with fluxes\nabove 6 percent of the Crab flux were taken into account to derive the numberintensity relation. The contribution of unresolved HESS-like sources to the\ndiffuse emission measured by Milagro was also estimated. Using the logN-logS\nrelation for the HESS sample of Galactic \u03b3-ray emitters at least 10 per cent of\nthe diffuse emission at TeV energies is estimated to be due to the contribution\n\n\fSabrina Casanova, Brenda Dingus\n\n257\n\nof unresolved HESS-like sources. This result is a lower limit for such a contribution because we have taken into account only sources detected above 6 per cent\nof the Crab flux and because HESS sensitivity gets worse for extended sources,\nmeaning that some extended sources might have been missed by HESS. Using\nthe logN-logS relation we have also predicted the number of HESS-like sources\nwhich VERITAS, HESS and HAWC should detect during their survey of the\nsky.\nAn alternative procedure to evaluate the contribution of unresolved HESSlike sources to Milagro diffuse emission gives the diffuse flux due to unresolved\nsources comparable to the diffuse emission itself. We also constrained the slope\nof the luminosity function. New observational results support the hypothesis\nthat a population of unresolved sources contribute significantly to the emission\nat very high energy. Milagro has recently reported the discovery of TeV gamma\nray emission from the Cygnus Region of the Galaxy, which exceeds the predictions of conventional models of gamma -ray production [19] from the same\nregion in the Galaxy where the Tibet Array has detected an excess of cosmic\nrays [20]. Milagro's recently improved sensitivity has also better imaged the\nwhole Northern sky and discovered seven new hot spots above 4.5 sigma, which\ncontribute 25 per cent of the Milagro emission [7, 8, 9]. HESS has seen very\nhigh energy emission spatially correlated with giant molecular clouds located\nin the Galactic Center [21]. The energy spectrum measured by HESS close\nto the Galactic Center is E \u22122.3 , significantly harder than the E \u22122.7 spectrum\nof the diffuse emission and equal to the average spectrum of the HESS source\npopulation. The emission from the Galactic Center might possibly unveil a\ncosmic ray accelerator.\nThe main uncertainty of our calculation consists in assuming that the distribution of \u03b3-ray sources follows the distribution of either pulsars or SNRs\nobserved in the radio. In particular, in order to predict how many PSRs observed in the radio have a PWN and are possible gamma ray emitters we used\nthe result that the spin-down energy loss dE/dt > dE/dtc = 4 \u00d7 1036 erg/s for\na young energetic pulsar to form a PWN. In this respect we have ignored the\nexistence of pulsars, such as Geminga, which are \u03b3-ray loud, yet not observed\nin the radio. To draw more definitive conclusions about the very high energy\n\u03b3-ray sky, new observations are of fundamental importance. New hints will be\nprovide by both MAGIC and VERITAS, which already survey the Cygnus Region. Finally GLAST will investigate the window of energy between 10 MeV to\n300 GeV, covering the energy gap left between EGRET and the ground-based\nlow threshold gamma-ray observatories.\n\n\f258\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nReferences\n[1] Atkins, R.

Caraveo\na\n\na,b\n\nIstituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica, INAF,\nVia Bassini, 15, 20133 Milano, Italy\nb\n\nINFN, Sezione di Pavia, via Ugo Bassi, 6, Pavia, Italy\n\nAbstract\nUnveiling the nature of a vast number of unidentified sources is the most\ncompelling problem facing today's high-energy (MeV-to-GeV) gammaray astronomy. However, unidentified sources are not peculiar to highenergy gamma-ray astronomy, they have been an ever-present phenomenon\nin astronomy.\nOwing to the intrinsic limitations of gamma-ray detection technique,\nhowever, the instruments' angular resolution has not yet reached the\nminimum level required to permit the transition from the unidentified\nlimbo to the identified status, thus creating a continuing unidentified\nhigh-energy gamma-ray source problem.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhile trying to understand celestial objects, astronomers are frequently facing\nchallenging sources (or classes of sources) which defy easy classification. The\ndiscovery of a new class of celestial objects can result in a rather quick major\ndiscovery, as was the case for pulsars and quasars, or in a long struggle. Trimble\n(2003) [17] has quantified the time needed to solve a number of astronomical\n259\n\n\f260\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\npuzzles finding values of \"the maximum duration of astronomical incomprehension\" ranging from the 25 years needed to unravel the mystery of GRBs to\nmore than a century needed to understand coronal lines or Mira variables.\nUnidentified gamma ray sources( UGOs for short), still happily with us since\nthe publication of the first COS-B catalogue in 1977 [11], have long passed the\nquarter century mark, resisting all efforts to nail down their nature.\nIndeed, as time (and gamma-ray missions) went by, the number of sources\ngrew dramatically, making the source identification problem even more compelling.\nAs of today, while waiting for the new look of the gamma ray sky which\nwill be provided by Agile and Glast, the current gamma ray source catalogue\n[10] lists 271 sources, 172 of which have no identification (neither certain nor\nprobable). To make matters worse, the 99 identified sources belong to just\ntwo classes of celestial objects: pulsars (6 objects) and active galactic nuclei\n(all the remaining IDs), both classes having been recognized by virtue of their\nvariability. A more diverse source portfolio would be most welcome, but no\ncompelling evidence of different source classes has been collected so far.\n2\n\nStruggling towards identifications\n\nIndeed, something unusual has already been found: the first and, so far, the\nonly source successfully identified turned out to be the first example of a radio quiet pulsar, a variety of neutron star long posited to exist but so far very\nelusive. The phenomenology of Geminga seems custom-made for gamma ray astronomy. The source is indeed brightest at gamma-ray wavelength, detectable,\nbut unremarkable, in X-rays and darn faint at optical wavelengths [3]. While\nX-ray photons provided the first evidence of the source periodicity, the optical counterpart yielded first the source proper motion and later its parallactic\ndistance. Now Geminga is known to behave exactly like a pulsar, were it not\nfor the lack of normal radio emission (sporadic emission has been reported, so\nfar unconvincingly). Geminga-like objects are expected to make a significant\ncontribution to the galactic gamma-ray source population, although their intrinsic low luminosity can account only for relatively nearby sources. Indeed,\nthe success story of the identification of Geminga rests on the fortuitous combination of distance and flux values that happened to render the source just\nwithin reach of the best instruments available at the time of the \"Chase\".\nThe \"Next Geminga\" source provides an example of the difficulties one can\nencounter with a slightly more distant source. 3EG J1835+5918 is the brightest\namong the 172 unidentified gamma-ray sources and, luckily enough, is ideally\npositioned, well above the galactic plane in the Cygnus region. X-ray coverage\nof the gamma-ray error box unveiled a source for which no optical counterpart\nhas been found, making it a convincing case for a radio quiet isolated neutron\n\n\fPatrizia A. Caraveo\n\nThe puzzle of unidentified gamma-ray sources\n\n261\n\nstar, hence the name of \"Next Geminga\" given by the discoverers [14], [7], .\nPresumably about 4 times more distant than Geminga (still less than 1 kpc\nfrom us), 3EG J1835+5918 offers a clear example of the difficulties one faces\nwhen dealing with radio quiet neutron stars. Geminga-like luminosities yield\nflux values too faint to allow detection of the source pulsation in X-rays, while\nthe optical emission is probably beyond reach of all current telescopes, thus\nhampering the possibility of measuring a proper motion which would clinch the\nidentification. The only development foreseen at this point [8] is the detection of\na periodicity in the gamma-ray data, i.e. the smoking gun for any INS. While\nthis is certainly possible with the new generation of gamma-ray telescopes,\nunveiling pulsation directly in gamma-ray data has never been done before and\nwould be a remarkable first.\nOf course, compact objects in binary systems could also be of interest\nto gamma-ray astronomy. One such system is GT 0236 [15], also known as\nLSI 61\u25e6 303, which has been considered a potential counterpart of the COS-B\ngamma ray source CG 135+01 since the discovery of its X-ray emission [2]. It\nis a peculiar binary system with a remarkable 26 day periodicity detected at\nradio wavelengths and also present at optical [12] and X-ray wavelengths [9].\nSuch periodicity offers a vary useful handle to a potential gamma-ray identification but, most unfortunately, no convincing evidence of orbital variability has\nyet been found in high energy gamma-ray data [16], [13]. Perhaps the orbital\nperiodicity is superimposed to an erratic behavior, as happens to be the case\nin X-rays [5]. However, the detection of very high energy gamma rays varying\nat the correct orbital period [1] has recently revived the interest in the source,\nexactly 25 years after the original suggestion by [2].\n3\n\nLooking for diversity in the gamma-ray sky\n\nThe situation of today's gamma-ray astronomy is similar to that of X-ray astronomy at the end of the Uhuru mission, when the catalogue of Uhuru sources\n[6] listed 339 source, 206 of which without identification. At variance with\ngamma-ray astronomy, the sources identified belonged to different classes: pulsars, binary systems, stars, AGNs. The development of X-ray telescopes, based\non grazing incidence techniques, allowed for a fantastic improvement in angular\nresolution, easing significantly the identification procedure.\nGamma-ray astronomy cannot count on such a dramatic improvement.\nEven if the performances of Agile and GLAST promise to be much better\nthat that of the previous generation of gamma-ray telescopes, their source positioning will be, at best, in the several arcmin region, far too much to allow\nfor an unambiguous identification, especially in crowded galactic regions .\nIn view of the limited angular resolution, gamma-ray source identification\nmust rely, yet again, on additional pieces of information. While the photon\n\n\f262\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\narrival times will continue to be exploited searching for some kind of correlated\nvariability, the number of sources expected for a mission such as GLAST, however, renders a Geminga-like multiwavelength approach impossible to pursue.\n3.1 Towards a new identification strategy\nA different strategy is being worked out by the GLAST Working Groups, by\nproposing the idea of going \"from detection to association to identification\",\nmostly (but not only) through a statistical approach. Since multiple positional\ncoincidences with field objects will be the rule rather than the exception, a\n\"figure of merit\" approach has to be developed for ranking the proposed candidates, see e.g. [4]. First, for each source class a chance occurrence probability\nparameter should be computed in order to weight the relative abundance of a\ngiven source class. In general, counterparts belonging to a class of \"certified\"\ngamma-ray emitters will be ranked higher than a counterparts belonging to a\nnew, yet unseen, class. Whereas population studies may offer insights on the\nexistence of yet unknown gamma-ray sources classes, we ultimately need to single out prominent individuals of such classes and unequivocal identify them to\nestablish confidence in the existence of new classes of high-energy gamma-ray\nemitters. Of course, the \"figure of merit\" should also takes into account the\ndisplacement of the proposed candidate from the best source position. Next,\nthe energetic plausibility of the association should be evaluated. A proposed\ncounterpart unable to meet the energetic requirement set by its gamma-ray\nflux and its supposed distance will be discarded. Finally, the general source\nphenomenology will be scrutinized to see if its parameters, such as gamma-ray\nemission efficiency, spectral shape, variability etc, are consistent with those of\na given source class.\nThe use of time variabilities as an identification tool will be exploited also\nthrough a comprehensive program of coordinated observations devoted to different classes of objects. Multiwavelength campaigns will be the last resort\nused, when everything else has failed or there is no other way to confirm an\nidentification. In order to avoid an a priori limitation on the GLAST potential\nfor discovery, one should keep in mind that any figure of merit approach as\nwell as any kind of monitoring campaign will be biased toward known source\nclasses.\nBeing ready for the unknown is a challenging task but it is the only way to\nlimit the duration of astronomical incomprehension in high-energy gamma-ray\nastronomy.\n\n\fPatrizia A.

The original active galacic nucleus\n(AGN) may be dead but the fossil will retain its stable magnetic configuration resembling the reversed-field pinch (RFP) encountered in laboratory MHD experiments. Slow decay of the large-scale RFP field induces\nelectric fields which can accelerate cosmic rays with an E \u22122 power-law\nup to ultra-high energies. A similar mechanism, operting for fossil microquasars could contribute to Galactic cosmic rays and be responsible for\nsome unidentified GeV and TeV gamma-ray sources.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe energy spectrum of cosmic rays (CR) extends from below 1 GeV up to at\nleast 1020 eV, and at the highest energies is almost certainly extragalactic. Possible acceleration sites of these ultra-high energy (UHE) CR include hotspots\nof giant radio galaxies, the intergalactic medium, gamma ray bursts and blazar\njets. UHE CR are subject to interaction with the cosmic microwave background\nradiation (CMBR) by pion photoproduction as was first noted by Greisen [1]\n265\n\n\f266\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nand Zatsepin & Kuzmin [2], and the cut-off they predicted is referred to as the\n\"GZK cut-off\". See ref. [3] for a recent review of UHE CR.\nRemnants of AGN jets and their surrounding cocoons may persist long after\ntheir parent AGN fade from view. These colossal MHD structures decay slowly\nand yet may retain their relatively stable self-organized configurations. Decay\ndepends on the structure circuit resistance, and lifetimes could be quite long,\ngiven the large inductance of the circuit, an initial outward current along the\njet and a return current back along an outer sheath or cocoon around the jet.\nOn the immense scale of these fossil jets, the decay time from instability can\nbe billions of years. However, decay of these colossal MHD structures on such\ntime-scales result in electric fields capable of accelerating existing populations\nof lower energy cosmic rays up to ultra high energies with a flat spectrum\nextending from some minimum rigidity (momentum/charge) determined by\nfossil dimensions, magnetic field and decay time. A more extensive discussion\nand full details of our present work are given in ref. [4].\n\n2\n\nEvolution of AGN Fossil Magnetic Structures\n\nHelical structures are common in AGN jets, arising during jet formation from\nrotation of magnetized plasma accreting toward the central black hole \u2013 this\ncould be enhanced in the case of binary black hole systems. Azimuthal electric\ncurrents are therefore likely, yielding a magnetic field component along the\njet direction. Laboratory MHD experiments show that reversed-field pinches\nare fairly stable, and are therefore likely configurations of \"fossil jets\", and\nBenford [7] has proved that for jet-built RFP structures, the same simple MHD\nstability conditions for a jet guarantee stability, even after the jet turns off. We\ndiscuss elsewhere [4] further details the stability of MHD structures, but here\nwe concentrate on radio and X-ray observations of fossil jets. Recent detections\nof several ghost cavities in galaxy clusters [5] \u2013 often, but not always, radioemitting \u2013 suggest that the cluster hot plasma stays well separated from the\nbulk of the relativistic plasma on a timescale of \u223c100 Myr. This means that\nmagnetic structures made stable while a jet is on can evolve into fossils that\npersist long after the building jet current has died away. These may be the\nrelic radio \"fossils\", \"ghost bubbles\" or \"magnetic balloons\" found in clusters\nand made visible by contrast against the X-ray emission as seen in Hydra A\n[8]. Giant radio galaxies such as Cyg A are building such structures now. Such\nfossils have a massive inventory of magnetic energy that can be \u223c1060 erg [6].\nSuch enormous amounts of energy can only come from the gravitational infall\nenergy of a supermassive black hole, when jets convey a few percent of the\nenergy outward.\n\n\fR.J. Protheroe & G. Benford\n\nFossil AGN as Cosmic Particle Accelerators\n\n267\n\nFigure 1: Magnetic field components of an RFP.\n3\n\nParticle acceleration in a reversed field pinch\n\nThe simplest idealization would be for an infinite cylindrical jet where the\nmagnetic field in cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6, z) is [9]\nBr = 0, B\u03c6 (r) = B0 J1 (\u03b1r), Bz (r) = B0 J0 (\u03b1r),\n\n(1)\n\nand this has been shown [10] to be stable for \u03b1r < 3.176. This radius for\nstability which we take to be R \u2261 3.176/\u03b1 is where a conducting wall with a\nlarge inertial mass would be present in an experimental situation, and provide\npart of the circuit along which a return current could flow, which we assume\nhere to be the cocoon. The magnetic field is shown in Fig. 1. Notice the\nlongitudinal field changes sign at rcrit = 2.405/\u03b1, the first zero of J0 (\u03b1r).\nThe current density and vector potential are everywhere proportional to\nthe magnetic field,\n~j(r)\n\n=\n\n~\nB(r)\u03b1\n\u03bc0\n\n\u22122\n\n(A m\n\n),\n\n~ \u03c6, z) = 1 B(r,\n~ \u03c6, z).\nA(r,\n\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\nElectric fields from reconnection are emfs induced according to Faraday's\nlaw, and so the electric field will be more extensive. The cold plasma (pressure\nis low) responsible for currents which maintain the magnetic structure cannot\nshort out these electric fields, since they are inductively driven everywhere in\nthe structure, allowing acceleration outside the reconnection zone. Assuming\na flow of flux lines toward the reconnection region, the field will be changing\neverywhere and will induce an electric field. The simplest way of estimating\n\n\f268\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nthis global electric field is by assuming an exponential decay of the magnetic\nfield,\n~\nB(t)\n=\n\nB0 e\u2212t/tdec [J1 (\u03b1r)\u03c6\u0302 + J0 (\u03b1r)\u1e91].\n\n(3)\n\nThen,\n~\n\u2202A\nE~ = \u2212\n\u2202t\n\n=\n\n3.18 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\n\u0012\n\nB0\n10 \u03bcG\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nR\n100 kpc\n\n\u00d7 [J1 (\u03b1r)\u03c6\u0302 + J0 (\u03b1r)\u1e91]e\u2212t/tdec\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\ntdec\nGyr\n\n(V m\u22121 )\n\n\u0013\u22121\n(4)\n\nWe have simulated charged particle trajectories in the RFP magnetic field\nincluding the effect of energy change in the induced electric field. We inject\nparticles uniformly and isotropically over the surfaces of disks of radius R at\nboth ends of the fossil jet of length L, and follow their motion until they escape.\nA typical example is shown in Fig. 2(a).\n\nFigure 2: (a) Three orthogonal views showing a typical trajectory in the RFP\nfields, and critical radius (dashed).

Solid curve: shows analytic result from Fig. 3(b).\nUltra-relativistic particles of charge Ze are injected with energy E0 and\ntheir final energies are binned as shown in Fig. 2(b). Since the induced electric\nfield is in the same direction as the magnetic field, energy is gained as particles\nmove along field lines. Since the induced electric field is proportional to the\nmagnetic field according to Eq. 4, positively charged particles will gain energy\nfor pitch angles less than 90\u25e6 and lose energy if their pitch angles are greater\nthan 90\u25e6 .\n\n\fR.J.

Benford\n\nFossil AGN as Cosmic Particle Accelerators\n\n269\n\nThe energy gain on traversing the fossil jet length L will actually depend on\nthe pitch angle \u03c8 of the helical magnetic field line acting as the guiding centre.\nSo, positive particles injected into the RFP with r < rcrit will gain energy while\nmoving in the positive z direction, and those injected with rcrit < r < R will\ngain energy while moving in the negative z direction. The increase in energy\nof ultra-relativistic particles of charge Ze is\nEgain\n\n0\n= Egain\n\nJ0 (\u03b1r)2 + J1 (\u03b1r)2\nJ0 (\u03b1r)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n0\nEgain\n\n18\n\n\u2248 (10 Z eV )\n\n\u0012\n\nB0\n10 \u03bcG\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nL\nMpc\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nR\n100 kpc\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\ntdec\nGyr\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nand this is plotted in Fig. 3(a).

In Fig. 2(b)\nwe have added the analytical spectrum and compared it with that obtained\nby following particle trajectories. The analytic slope, which asymptotically is\nE \u22122 , is consistent with the histogram. Note that the \"double peaked\" structure\nis due to separate contributions from injection at r < rcrit and r > rcrit .\nThe shape of the spectrum reflects a geometric property of the acceleration\nmechanism, as particles near rcrit being preferentially accelerated to become\nUHE CRs.\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nFor an extragalactic source distribution producing an E \u22122 spectrum of protons,\nLipari [11] estimates the local power requirement to be \u223c 1050 erg Mpc\u22123 y\u22121 .\nDecaying magnetic fields with local filling factor \u03b7B lose energy at a rate\nu\u0307B\n\n\u223c\n\n1053 \u03b7B\n\n\u0012\n\nB0\n10 \u03bcG\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\ntdec\nGyr\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\nerg Mpc\u22123 y\n\n\u22121\n\nMagnetic fields from quasars can fill up to 5\u201320% of the intergalactic medium\n[12] \u2013 probably higher locally since our Galaxy is in a \"Wall\". Indeed, GopalKrishna & Wiita [13] estimate the fractional relevant volume that radio lobes\nborn during the quasar era cumulatively cover is \u223c0.5. Hence, our crude energetics arguments show fossil AGN structure decay could well be responsible\nfor the observed UHE CR.\nThe spectrum of accelerated particles will cut off at some maximum momentum determined by either the finite thickness of the reconnection zone\n(recall that in the analytic approximation as r \u2192 rcrit , Egain \u2192 \u221e), or by the\ngyroradius increasing so that it is no longer much less than the radius of the\nfossil. From Fig. 1, we see that for r < R the magnetic field is in the range\n0.4B0 < B < B0 . Hence, the condition rL \u226a R implies\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nB0\nR\nmax\nEgain\n\u226a (1021 Z eV )\n.\n(9)\n10 \u03bcG\n100 kpc\nThe spectrum of UHE CR observed at Earth would have contributions\nfrom nearby fossil jets at different distances, with different powers and each\n0\nhaving different dimensions and magnetic fields, and hence a range of Egain\nmax\nand Egain . Given that several percent of the universe's volume may house\nsuch slowly decaying structures, these fossils may even re-energize ultra-high\nenergy cosmic rays from distant/old sources, offsetting the GZK-losses due to\n\n\fR.J. Protheroe & G. Benford\n\n271\n\nFossil AGN as Cosmic Particle Accelerators\n\ninteractions with photons of the cosmic microwave background radiation and\ngiving evidence of otherwise undetectable fossils.\nFor an individual fossil, the cut-off is expected to be rigidity dependent,\nimplying the observed composition would change from light to heavy close\nto the cut-off if one or two nearby AGN fossils dominate. However, if distant\nsources dominate nuclei will be photo-disintegrated by interactions with CMBR\nphotons, and in this case the composition would remain light to the highest\nenergies if distant sources or fossils dominated. Otherwise the composition\ncould be mixed near the observed cut off.\nWe expect most of the fossil jets to be below the sensitivity of current radio\ntelescopes, based on the work of Blundell & Rawlings [14], and it is impossible at\nthe present time to make firm predictions for the expected UHE CR intensity at\nEarth. However, this may well change when the SKA (www.skatelescope.org/)\nis commissioned. Nevertheless, we have demonstrated that it is possible for\nthis process to accelerate protons to UHE, and nuclei to a Z times higher\nenergy, and shown that the power requirements may reasonably be achieved\ngiven plausible volume filling factors.\nIn conclusion, remnants of jets and their surrounding cocoons may still\nbe present around or close to galaxies which contain AGN which are now no\nlonger active. These fossil jets are colossal MHD structures and may have\ntotal energies \u223c 1060 erg. We have shown that decay of such structures over\ntimescales of \u223cGyr induces large-scale electric fields which accelerate cosmic\nrays an E \u22122 power-law up to ultra-high energies. Energetics arguments show\nthat this provides a plausible mechanism for the origin of the UHE CR.\nFinally, Heinz & Sunyaev [15] have shown that particles should be accelerated at the reverse shock of a micro-quasar jet colliding with the interstellar\nmedium, and that this may give a contribution to the galactic cosmic rays up\nto about \u223c10 GeV. We mention here the possibility of particle acceleration by\ninduced electric fields in a micro-quasar's decaying remnant magnetic bubbles\nafter the micro-quasar's jets have switched off, as in the case of fossil AGN, if\nthey form self organized magnetic structures such as the RFP.

We provide detailed predictions\nof the expected anisotropies based on the map of the local universe from\nthe PSCz astronomical catalogue. We then discuss the chances to detect\nthe predicted signal with the forthcoming satellite observatory GLAST\nand the extensive air showers detectors Milagro, and HAWC.\n\n1\n\nGamma Astronomy\n\nThe 0.1\u201310 TeV range represents one of the \"last\" photonic windows yet to be\nexplored at large distances. Besides single sources, wide field of view instruments like the extensive air showers detectors (EAS) Milagro, Argo and the\nplanned HAWC and satellite-based observatories like GLAST are sensitive to\ndiffuse \u03b3-ray emissions.\nA particularly interesting emission is the extragalactic diffuse \u03b3-ray background (in the following, cosmic gamma background, or CGB). The CGB is\na superposition of all unresolved sources emitting \u03b3-rays in the Universe and\nprovides an interesting signature of energetic phenomena over cosmological\ntime-scales. While a clear detection of this background has been reported\n273\n\n\f274\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nby the EGRET mission [1], its origin is still uncertain, despite the fact that\nmany models have been proposed. The most likely contribution is the one from\nunresolved blazars, i.e. beamed population of active galactic nuclei, with (probably sub-leading) components from ordinary galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and\ngamma ray bursts. However, exotic possibilities like dark matter annihilation\nhave been proposed, that are compatible with existing data and constraints.\nIt is extremely difficult to test such models as long as the only observable is\nthe energy spectrum. Recently, it was proposed to use the peculiar small-scale\nanisotropy encoded in the MeV-GeV gamma sky to probe dark matter [2, 3]\nor astrophysical [4, 5] contributions to the CGB. We further study this topic,\nwith particular emphasis on the large scale anisotropy in the energy range 0.110 TeV. The lower part of this range will be probed by the GLAST telescope [6],\nwhile the energy window above the TeV is in principle accessible to EAS detectors like Milagro [7] and Argo [8]. Different candidates to explain the CGB\npredict distinctive large scale features, even when similar energy spectra are\nexpected. This is a consequence of the combined effect of a cutoff distance after\nwhich \u03b3 of energy starting from about 100 GeV (the very-high energy regime,\nVHE) can travel undamped to us, and of the anisotropic distribution of matter\nin the local universe (i.e., within a few hundred Mpc from us), the local Large\nScale Structures (LSS). We shall then use the redshift Point Sources Catalogue\n(PSCz) [9] as tracer of the real structures in the nearby universe, thus producing maps of the VHE gamma sky. For a more complete and detailed discussion\nof the present issues we refer the reader to the paper [10].\nIt is interesting to note that a similar horizon (and a similar correlation\nwith LSS) is expected for cosmic rays particles of energy & 1019 eV (the so\ncalled ultra-high energy (UHE) regime) [11] (see also [12]). Indeed, possibly\na fraction of the CGB could be associated to the \u03b3 cascades produced by the\nenergy losses from the propagation of UHE hadrons [13].\nThe observation of the extra-galactic TeV sky is limited by the presence of\nthe much more intense galactic foreground. Indeed, the detection of a diffuse\nemission along the galactic plane has been recently reported by the MILAGRO\ncollaboration with a median energy of \u223c20 TeV [14]. Interestingly, the emission\ndetected by MILAGRO significantly exceeds the flux expected from the models\nof diffuse emission in the galaxy, challenging our present understanding of the\ngalactic radiation production mechanism [15]. This result clearly shows the\nimportance and complementarity of large field of view observations for a full\nunderstanding of the astrophysical and/or exotic phenomena taking place in the\ngamma sky. The detection of the anisotropies of the extra-galactic gamma-sky,\nanalogously, would complement the point sources study in the characterization\nof the extra-galactic high-energy gamma sky.\n\n\fA. Cuoco\n\nCosmological Large Scale Anisotropies in the HE gamma-ray sky\n\n275\n\nFigure 1: Equatorial density \u03b3 sky maps from the PSCz catalogue for Ecut =\n100 GeV and 1 TeV. The color scale is linear and the average flux outside the\nmask of the PSCz is normalized to 1 so that to represent adimensional maps.\nThe mask of the PSCz survey is indicated by the thick grey contour.\n\n\f276\n2\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nSky maps and forecast\n\nIn Fig. 1 we plot the resulting \u03b3 maps from the PSCz catalogue in equatorial\ncoordinates for Ecut = 100 GeV and 1 TeV. For the case of the map with\nEcut = 100 GeV, modulo the \"hole\" due to the mask the pattern is quite\nisotropic, with some hot spots like e.g. from the Virgo and Perseus Clusters.\nOther structures which appear are the Shapley concentration and the Columba\ncluster (for a key of the local cosmological structures see [11]). Given the limited\nstatistics of GLAST at high energies, the TeV map is of interest especially for\nthe EAS gamma detectors like MILAGRO. We see in this case that the nearest\nstructures, forming the Super-Galactic Plane, dominate. Of course, from the\nNorthern emisphere (where all the present or planned EAS instruments are\nlocated) only the upper part of the map is visible. Here, the Virgo Cluster and\nthe Perseus cluster offer the strongest anisotropy.\nTo obtain the maps the effects of the propagation of the particles through\nthe relevant Infrared/Optical and Microwave backgrounds have been properly\ntaken into account. Further details can be found in the paper [10].\nWhat are the real chances to detect these anisotropies with the data from\nthe forthcoming experiments? To answer the question\nwe have performed an\nP\na\nharmonic decomposition of the maps f (\u03a9\u0302) =\nlm lm Ylm (\u03a9\u0302) and then assessed the predicted shot noise errors on the alm due to the finite statistics\ncollected by a given experiment. In particular, the errors read as \u03c3a2lm =\n4\u03c0fsky /N\u03b3 (1 + NCR /N\u03b3 ) where N\u03b3 and NCR are respectively the numbers of\nphotons and background events collected and fsky is the fraction of the sky accessible to the experiment (assumed with uniform acceptance over this region).\nIn Fig. 2 we report the coefficients alm 's up to lmax = 10 calculated from\nthe PSCz gamma maps of Fig.1, with the relative errors for a 4 year exposure of\nthe GLAST mission and 10 years for the EAS Milagro and HAWC. Performing\nthe analysis in terms of the harmonics coefficients alm instead of angular power\nspectrum Cl 's has the advantage of exploiting the full information present in\nthe map (for an angular scale of order \u03b8 = \u03c0/l) without the limit imposed by\ncosmic variance.\nGLAST should be able to detect some structures above 100 GeV at the\n2\u03c3 level, while, on the contrary, instruments like MILAGRO may hardly find\nhints of structures at 1 TeV (gray band in the bottom panel of Fig. 2). We\nnote that the intensity of the anisotropies increases sensibly from the 100 GeV\nenergy band to 1 TeV, but, despite the increased signal and statistics collected,\nground arrays have an hard task in detecting the CGB fluctuations. The signal\ndetected by EAS arrays is infact buried under an heavy background of Cosmic\nRays events that overwhelms the gamma signal typically by a factor of order\n105 ! Rejection capability helps in removing part of the background. Note that\nGLAST is expected to have an excellent background identification, so that only\ncosmic rays in the amount of \u223c 6% of the gamma flux pass the cuts. On the\n\n\fA. Cuoco\n\nCosmological Large Scale Anisotropies in the HE gamma-ray sky\n\n277\n\nother hand, EAS experiments have a poor rejection capability, which increases\ntypically the gamma content of the diffuse flux by no more than one order of\nmagnitude. Therefore even after gamma/hadron separation, the anisotropies\nof the gamma sky have to be identified against a quasi-isotropic background\nwhich is \u223c 104 larger than the gamma flux.\nThe intensity of the anisotropies also potentially increases in some scenarios\nof DM gamma production. In this case, the gamma emission is expected to\nfollow the square of the DM density distribution due to the peculiar production\nmechanism proceeding through DM-DM annihilation [2]. A detailed study of\nthis issue is in progress [16].\n\nFigure 2: The coefficients alm up to lmax = 10 calculated from the PSCz gamma\nmaps of Fig. 1. The shaded band shows the 1-\u03c3 shot noise error; in the bottom\npanel the inner shaded region refers to HAWC, the outer one to MILAGRO.\nIt is further\u221a worth to notice that for an EAS detector the error on the\nalm 's scales as NCR /N\u03b3 . Therefore the reduction of the shot-noise error goes\nlike (t * Aeff )\u22121/2 (both NCR and N\u03b3 grow linearly with t * Aeff , the\u221acollecting\ntime times the effective area of the experiment), or equivalently as hcut /gcut\n\n\f278\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\n(where gcut and hcut are the fraction of \u03b3's and hadrons that survive after the\ntrigger cuts): improving the exposure is equally important as improving the\ngamma/hadron separation capability. A simple inspection of Fig. 2 reveals\nthat for a realistic detection of the features in the VHE sky one would need the\nimprovement in effective area planned to be reached by instruments like HAWC\n[17] (see inner green band in the bottom panel of Fig. 2). An instrument like\nARGO is expected to have performances in between MILAGRO and HAWC,\nand may have some chance especially if a significant improvement in hadron\nrejection can be made. Also, note that due to their altitude HAWC (planned\nat an altitude of \u223c4000 m [18]) and ARGO (at an altitude of 4300 m) have a\nsignificant acceptance of sub-TeV events. While the gamma/hadron separation\nis less efficient at lower energies, the higher statistics may help in revealing these\nstructures. Indeed, the ARGO collaboration has recently presented the first\npreliminary results [19], showing a significant sensitivity increase and lower\nenergy threshold with respect to MILAGRO (located at an altitude of 2630\nm).\nWe also note that these estimates are somewhat conservative: summing the\npower at different l's may favor the detection (see e.g. [5]), and cross-correlating\ndirectly with the maps we have produced would eventually rely on the whole\ninformation.\nFinally, the ultimate limitation in detecting anisotropies in the gamma sky\nwith EAS observatories is expected to come from the understanding of the intrinsic anisotropy in the CR background that are generally measured at the level\nof few\u00d710\u22124 and are then comparable to the expected intrinsic \u03b3 anisotropy.\nOne possible strategy to tackle this problem, could consist in reversing the\ngamma cut and thus enriching the sample in hadronic showers thus helping in\nidentifying and removing non-gamma anisotropies.\n3\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nIt is a pleasure to thank S.

Its\nlow energy threshold at well below 100 GeV as well its fast reaction\nand repositionning capabilities make it an ideal instrument to follow up\nGRBs rapidly in the very high energy (VHE) energy range. In the past\ntwo years, the MAGIC collaboration has demonstrated in two cases that\nthe telescope is able to observe the promt emission of GRBs, if rapid\nalerts from satellite experiments are provided. Due to the absorption of\ngamma-rays by the Meta-galactic Radiation Field (MRF), it is necessary\nthat the GRB lies at a redshift below z \u223c 1 in order to expect a signal\naround 100 GeV. Upper limits have been published for a total of 12\nGRBs.\n\n281\n\n\f282\n1\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nIntroduction\n\nBoth the physical origin of GRBs as possible emission of gamma-rays in the\nVHE regime are still under debate, even 40 years after their discovery. Especially the detection of high-energy radiation will lead to a deeper understanding of the involved emission processes. Many attempts were therefore\nmade in the past to observe GRBs in the GeV and TeV energy range, however without stringent evidence for the existance of a very high-energy emission\ncomponent, neither during the prompt emission nor during the afterglow (see\ne.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]). The only significant detections were made by the EGRET\ndetector which could observe seven GRBs emitting gamma-rays with energies\nbetween 100 MeV and 18 GeV [6] without showing any apparent cut-off in the\nenergy spectrum. Results from the TASC shower counter, part of the EGRET\ndetector, jointly fit with BATSE data, indicate that the spectrum of at least one\nburst contained a very hard, luminous, long-duration component presumably\ndue to ultra-relativistic hadrons with a differential photon flux spectral index\nof \u03b1 = \u22121 with no cut-off up to the TASC detector energy limit at 200 MeV [7].\nSince the start of data taking of the second generation of Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT), a sufficiently good flux sensitivity and\nlow energy threshold have been achieved to follow the GRB spectra up to energies of &100 GeV. Nevertheless, as their small field of view does allow prompt\nobservations only by - unprobable - serendipitous detection, they have to rely\non external triggering, as the one provided by the automated satellite link\nto the Gamma-Ray Burst Coordinates Network (GCN), which broadcasts the\ncoordinates of events triggered and selected by dedicated satellite detectors.\nThe detection of VHE emission from the GRB is important for comparing\ndifferent theoretical models. In the framework of the popular fireball model,\ngamma-ray emission in the GeV-TeV range in the prompt and delayed phase is\npredicted by several authors. Possible emission mechanisms appear in leptonic\nand hadronic models. In the first case, inverse-Compton (IC) scattering by\nelectrons in internal or external shocks (e.g. [9, 10]), IC in the afterglow shocks\n(e.g. [11, 12]) and IC by electrons responsible of optical flashes [13, 14] have been\nproposed. Even considering pure electron synchrotron radiation, measurable\nVHE gamma-ray emission for a significant fraction of GRBs is predicted [12].\nSuggested hadronic models comprise proton-synchrotron emission, photon-pion\nproduction and neutron cascades (e.g. [15, 16, 17, 18])\nThe recent observations of X-ray flares in the early afterglow phase by the\nSWIFT satellite [19] suggested the possibility of correlated gamma-ray emission\nextending to the GeV and TeV energy range lasting for 103 s to 104 s where\nstrong GeV-TeV flares from IC scattered photons in the forward shock were\npredicted [20].\nHowever, due to the strong absorption of gamma-rays by the MRF [21, 22],\nit is necessary that the GRB lies at a redshift below z \u223c 1 in order to expect\n\n\fM. Gaug, D. Bastieri et al.,\n\nObservation of GRBs with MAGIC\n\n283\n\na signal around 100 GeV.\n\n2\n\nThe MAGIC Telescope\n\nThe Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope [23],\nlocated on the Canary Island of La Palma (2200 m a.s.l, 28.45\u25e6N, 17.54\u25e6 W),\nis currently the largest single dish (17 m diameter tessellated reflector dish)\nIACT with the lowest energy threshold. As recently reported [24], MAGIC is\nable to reconstruct energy spectra down to about 60 GeV if the observation\nis carried out at a low zenith angle. The faint Cherenkov light flashes are\nrecorded by a pixellized camera, comprised of 577 photo-multiplier tubes. In\nits current configuration, MAGIC has an accuracy in reconstructing the arrival\ndirections of gamma-rays (hereafter called point-spread-function PSF) of about\n0.1\u25e6 , slightly depending on the analysis. The telescope is focused at 10 km,\ni.e. the typical position of the shower maximum for energies at the threshold.\nThe trigger collection area for gamma-rays is of the order of 105 m2 , increasing\nfurther with the zenith angle of observation. Figure 1 shows the effective area\nfor gamma-rays, after typical analysis cuts for three representative zenith angles\nunder which the telescope observes the GRB. One can see the threshold energy\ndepends sensibly on the zenith angle.\nThe incident light pulses are converted into optical signals and transmitted\nto a control house over 162 m of optical fiber. There, the signals are converted\nback and digitized by fast Flash ADCs (FADCs). At the beginning of this\nyear, the FADC readout was upgraded from 300 MSamples/s to 2GSamples/s\nincreasing further the sensitivity of the telescope. All data presented here were\nstill taken with the old system, except for the very last burst shown. Due to its\nlight carbon fibre structure, MAGIC is the only IACT with fast repositionning\ncapabilities, designed especially for the observation of GRBs [25]. In case of a\nTarget of Opportunity alert by GCN, an automated procedure takes only few\nseconds to terminate any pending observation, validate the incoming signal\nand start slewing toward the GRB position. In its current configuration, the\nrepositionning speed of MAGIC is on average 42 s for GRB alerts. This allowed\nto set upper limits on the GRB prompt emission in some cases already [26].\nUpon receipt of the alert, the telescope operators have to validate the alert\nwhereupon the telescope enters in automatic fast-movement mode, moves directly to the transmitted GRB coordinates and starts observation immediately.\nRecently, additional security hardware has been installed which allows to make\nthe procedure fully automatic and recover thus the couple seconds lost by the\nreaction time of the operators. As long as the GRB coordinates are visible\nbelow a zenith angle of 60\u25e6 , the source is tracked for typically an hour until\nthe observation of the previous source is recovered.\n\n\f284\nm2\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nEffective Area\n\n105\n104\n3\n\n10\n\n20 deg\n102\n\n44 deg\n10\n\n57 deg\n1\n10-1\n10\n\n102\n\n3\n\n10\n\n104\n\n5\n\n10\nE [GeV]\n\nFigure 1: Effective area of MAGIC, after typical analysis cuts, for three different zenith angles\n\n3\n\nBlind test with the Crab Nebula\n\nOn 11th October 2005 at 02h 17m 37s UTC, the INTEGRAL satellite announced\nGRB051011 [28] at the position R.A. = 5h 34m 47s , Dec. = +21d 54\u2032 39\u2032\u2032 which\nlater turned out to be triggered by gamma-ray emission from the Crab Nebula.\nAs in the case of a real GRB, the MAGIC telescope immediately slewed to the\nsource and started data taking at zenith angles between 33\u25e6 and 42\u25e6 .

The results shown for the last four bursts\nare still preliminary.\nIn two cases (GRB050713a and GRB060904), the observation took place\nwhile the prompt emission was still ongoing [26, 27]. Figure 2 shows the case\nof GRB050713a, where part of the prompt emission could be observed and\nupper limits in the VHE energy region be set. In six cases, the MAGIC\nobservation overlapped with X-ray observations from space, namely in the\ncase of GRB050421, GRB050713a, GRB050904, GRB060206, GRB060825 and\nGRB061028.

Unfortunately, BAT triggered only on the main emission peak and not\non the precursor at -60 s. In that case, MAGIC would have also fully observed\nthe main peak. Right: Combined multi-wavelength SED of the early afterglow\nof GRB050713a. The three lines represent three emission models. Starting\nfrom 175 GeV, the upper limits set by MAGIC are in accordance with an extrapolated power law spectrum. In this particular case, the MAGIC sensitivity\nlay slightly above the expected synchrotron emission.\n\n5\n\nAnalysis and Results\n\nThe recorded events are reconstructed and calibrated using the standard MAGIC\nanalysis software [29]. The obtained signal charges are cleaned from spurious\nbackground from the light of night sky by requiring signals which exceed fixed\nreference levels and coincide in time with neighbouring channels. Standard\nHillas parameters are calculated [30] and several pre-cuts applied which remove\nnon-physical background images. The gamma-hadron separation is performed\noptimizing combinations of cuts by means of the Random Forest method [31].\nThe energy of the gamma-rays is estimated using the same approach, yielding\nan energy resolution of \u223c 30% at 200 GeV.\nDedicated OFF data samples were selected for each GRB observation separately which match the ON data observation conditions with respect to zenith\n\n\fM. Gaug, D. Bastieri et al.,\n\nObservation of GRBs with MAGIC\n\n287\n\nangle, background light intensity and atmospheric conditions. These OFF data\nsamples were passed through the same analysis chain and used to determine\nthe residual background due to hadronic showers.\nSubsequently, signals are searched in the recorded prompt emission phase (if\nany), during X-ray flares, in the integrated first 1000 s of data, the entire data\nset and in time bins of 100 s. Up to now, no significant excess over background\nhas been detected in any of these searches in any of the observed GRBs. Upper\nlimits were derived using the method of [32] in different energy bins. Table 1\nshows the obtained upper limits for the first half an hour of observation.\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nMAGIC is currently the fastest and most sensitive operative IACT at energies\naround 100 GeV and observes about 1 GRB per month. It has already shown\nits capability to observe part of the prompt emission phase of two GRBs. Due\nto the existing gamma-ray horizon, which limits the visibility of gamma-rays\nto distances less than z \u223c 1 at energies E > 100 GeV, many of the obtained\nupper limits have only a small impact on the interpretation of GRB data.\nWith the recent 2 GSamples/s FADC upgrade and other upgrades to further\nimprove the repositionning speed, it is only a question of time until MAGIC\nwill observe a sufficiently close-by burst to make a strong statement on the\nemission mechanisms of GRBs in the VHE regime.\nAcknoledgements\nWe would like to thank the IAC for excellent working conditions at the ORM\nat La Palma.

The un-ordered muon \u03bc and its neutrino\n\u03bd\u03bc arose later by cosmic rays. The tau \u03c4 discover, the heaviest, the\nmost unstable charged lepton, was found surprisingly on (1975). Its\n\u03bd\u03c4 neutrino was hardly revealed just on (2000). So why High Energy\nNeutrino Astronomy should rise first via \u03bd\u03c4 , the last, the most rare one?\nThe reasons are based on a chain of three favorable coincidences found\nlast decade: the neutrino masses and their flavor mixing, the UHECR\nopacity on Cosmic Black Body (GZK cut off on BBR), the amplified\n\u03c4 air-shower decaying in flight. Indeed guaranteed UHE GZK \u03bd\u03c4 , \u03bd\u03c4\nneutrinos, feed by muon mixing, while skimming the Earth might lead to\nboosted UHE \u03c4 ,\u03c4 , mostly horizontal ones. These UHE \u03c4 decay in flight\nare spread, amplified, noise free Air-Shower: a huge event for an unique\nparticle. To be observed soon: within Auger sky, in present decade. Its\ndiscover may sign of the first tau appearance.\n\n1\n\nThe Cosmic multi-frequency spectra up to GZK edges\n\nHigh energy neutrino astronomy at GZK [13],[16] limit is ready to be discovered. Its role may shine light in Universe understanding. Our present view of\n289\n\n\f290\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nthis Universe is summarized in radiation flux number spectra updated in Fig.1;\nits consequent energy fluency spectra in considered in Fig.2. The flux number\nspectra ranges from radio frequency to cosmic Black Body Radiation, BBR,\ntoward Cosmic Rays up to Ultra High Energy ones, UHECR. For calibration\nalso a BBR Fermi-Dirac for any eventual massless cosmic neutrino (at 1.9K\ntemperature). Light neutrino with mass are probably non-relativistic and gravitationally clustered, not displayed here. The role in cosmology of relic neutrinos\nhas been widely reviewed recently [8]. Infrared and the Optical photons fluxes\nare followed by UV and X cosmic ones. Last \u03b3 Astronomy is at MeV-GeV-TeV\nband edge. In MeV region, Supernova Cosmic relic Neutrinos background may\nsoon arise. Unfortunately the CR secondaries, \u03c0 \u00b1 ,\u03bc\u00b1 are blurred as well as\ntheir \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bde final atmospheric neutrinos: this cause to \u03bd\u03bc and \u03bde astronomy\nto be also smeared and polluted. The inclined line on edge Fig. 1 tag the socalled Waxmann- Bachall limit,\u2243 E \u22122 as a minimal limit for GRB and GZK\n\u03bd flux expectation. It is easy to note as this fluency is correlated to average\ncosmic radio background, as well as it is comparable to UHECR at ten EeV\nband and average GRB fluency. There are good reasons to foresee a WB GZK\nneutrino background too. The coexistence on many cosmic radiations makes\nthe known windows on the Universe an exciting growing puzzle. Neutrino astronomy at different band may offer the key answers. Indeed while photons are\nneutral, un-deflected, offering Astronomy pictures, most of the Cosmic Ray are\ncharged and smeared by galactic and cosmic magnetic fields. Therefore Cosmic\nRays (CR) offer only an integrated, short-sighted Astrophysics. The presence\nof galactic magnetic fields are reminding us of the puzzling absence of magnetic\nmonopoles in our Universe. The low energy multi-frequency spectra on left side\n(below TeV energy) is dominated by photons; at higher energies (TeV-PeVs)\nthe photons are rarer and opaque to relic extra-galactic Infrared photons. Tens\nTeV photons arrive only from nearby Universe (hundred Mpc radius); at PeV\nenergy, the cosmic Black Body Radiation (BBR) makes UHE photons bounded\nin our Local Group, (Mpc) size volume. Therefore only PeVs neutrinos may\nreach us from Universe edges. The right side Fig.1, the high energy one, is\ndominated by Cosmic Rays and its secondaries. The ruling dominance of solar\nphotons and of its neutrinos is obviously hidden here to avoid confusions.Indeed\nbeyond the MeV energies, where solar neutrino flux dominates, one expects a\npeculiar niche for the relic Supernova background, still on the edge of detection.\nAt tens MeV atmospheric neutrino noise will pollute this SN signal. Hopefully\nupgraded underground SK (Super Kamiokande) detector might soon reveal the\nSN trace. At the same 107 eV energy band, very rare and bright galactic supernova neutrino, as the famous SN1987A, might rarely blaze our Milky Way\nalmost once a century. Future Megaton Neutrino detectors could observe even\nnearby Andromeda Supernova, making three times larger the previous rate. In\nthe same energy range, much less power-full but more frequent neutrino burst,\n\n\fD. Fargion, D.

Above TeV they are free of atmospheric noise.\nThe GZK cut off at the extreme is the source of the GZK neutrino, at WB\nrange, discussed in the article.\n\n\f292\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nin all flavor, may rise from largest solar flares, once in a decade. They are\nbetter detectable by noise free anti-neutrino electron \u03bd e component in Megaton detectors. Among the cosmic rays, the secondary Atmospheric Neutrinos\narise, blurred and noisy as their parental CR. Therefore Neutrino muon and\nelectron signals are largely polluted by abundant atmospheric secondaries. The\ncharmed pions (rare parents of tau) are hardly produced by CR respect to pion\nand Kaon (< 10\u22125 ) [1]. Energetic atmospheric \u03bd\u03bc cannot feed \u03bd\u03c4 via neutrino\nmixing, because too short distance for known mass splitting. Then atmospheric\nHE \u03bd\u03c4 are suppressed and its astronomy is noise free. Unfortunately TeVs Tau\nneutrino are still difficult to be disentangled from other neutral current neutrino events. But higher energy ones, in PeV-EeV band, may reveal themselves\nloudly [9]. As discussed below.\n2\n\nThe Auger-Hires spectra: GZK cut-off, expected UHE \u03bd Fluxes\n\nUp to day the puzzles on CR and on UHECR remain unsolved: what are the\nsources, how they are accelerated, is there any GZK cut-off, why local UHECR\nsources are not yet observed? Agasa-Hires and Auger moved the problem answer randomly from one edges to another. BL-Lac connection with UHECR,\nfound first by Agasa [12] and confirmed somehow by Hires in last few years\n[14], apparently fade away by Auger null results. Clustering events too . The\nearly Agasa Galactic Anisotropy at EeV, hint for a timid, but relevant, new\nGalactic Neutron Astronomy, disappeared under Auger scrutiny. Moreover a\nsurprising composition record in Auger UHECR data is unexpected: a turn\ntoward heavy (Fe) nuclei at highest energy events. They may produce less\nneutrinos, if they are very local (but than, what are their arrival directions?).\nOtherwise being isotropic, they are call for a cosmic nature, possibly born at\nZeV energy. In this view their photo-nuclear fragility (diffusion distance of\nfew Mpc) imply once again a much abundant UHE GZK neutrino fluxes to be\nfound. The puzzle grows. The presence of a drastic or at least a mild decrease\nin UHECR spectra edges arose from Hires and AUGER data. This in contrast\nwith AGASA hint for the absence of a GZK cut off. The absence of source identifications within a GZK volume pose additional puzzles: are UHECR isotropic\nand homogeneous (as GRBs), spread along the whole Universe? How can they\novercome the cosmic photon opacity (GZK puzzle)? To face this possibility\nwe [6] did offer a decade ago the Z-Shower or Z-Burst model [6]. This model\nis based on UHE ZeV neutrinos primary, ejected from the cosmic sources as\nthe courier, transparent to BBR photons, interacting at the end of the flight,\nwith their relic non relativistic cosmic partners clustered in wide cloud as hot\ndark matter. They are the favorite target of the interaction via Z-boson resonance. The UHE Z produced and its decay in flight would lead to UHE\nnucleons traces of observed UHECR. This model got alternate attention and\n\n\fD. Fargion, D. D'Armiento et.al.,\n\nWhy Tau First?\n\n293\n\nfortune, but its motivation (the need to overcome isotropic and homogeneity\nUHECR spectra) survived the last Auger test [18]. More models able to fit\nthe spectra require a diffuse UHECR protons source around ZeV energy [3];\nsuch an energy for the primary in complete agreement with the Z-shower model\nversions, with a tuned neutrino mass at m\u03bd = 0.08 eV, well compatible with\ncosmological limits and atmospheric mass splitting [6],[7]. However, as noted\nabove, last surprising Auger claim of a heavy UHECR composition is making\nall these conclusions questionable. To estimate a minimal GZK neutrino flux\nwe note that the Auger UHECR at GZK knee E = 3.98 * 1019eV is corresponding to a small fluency (\u03a6GZK \u2243 6.6eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 ): at its average maxima\nE \u2243 1.1 * 1020 eV , the flux is very suppressed (\u03a6GZK \u2243 0.5eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121\n); this flux must suffered severe losses along the whole cosmic volumes, into\nGZK secondaries, mostly few EeV GZK neutrinos. A simple estimate may\nbe done based on this flux amplified by the Universe/GZK size ratio, a value\nof nearly two order of magnitude. The final total UHECR GZK fluence estimated in this and other ways is (\u03a6GZK \u2243 50eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 ), whose\nmain traces are electron pairs, \u03bd pairs of all three flavors. This offer, following most authors, a neutrino (pair) GZK minimal energy spectra at EeV.\n\u03a6\u03bd\u03c4 +\u03bd\u03c4 \u2243 20eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 to assume for up-going taus. This value may\nbe at worst a half of it, but not too far way. A different, convergent hint of a\nminimal fluency comes from the UHECR ankle threshold at E = 3.98 * 1018 eV\n: it may be mark the crossing from galactic to extragalactic components; it\nmay also mark the electron pair losses; it may also be source of photo-pion\nproduction of UHECR escaping from their bright source. The consequent fluency may exceed (\u03a6EeV s \u2243 25eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 ),compatible with previous\nfluency value. Therefore for sake of simplicity we assume around EeV energy a\nminimal flat (\u221d E \u22122 ) neutrino \u03c4 spectra (the sum of both two species), comparable with the WB one, at a nominal fluency \u03a6\u03bd\u03c4 +\u03bd\u03c4 \u2243 20eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 .\nFor a fluency 50% larger we derived [10], earlier estimate mainly for EUSO;\nwe considered in detail the Earth opacity to UHE neutrinos for an exact terrestrial density profile: its column depth defined the survival for UHE \u03bd\u03c4 at\neach zenith angle, the consequent \u03c4 probability to escape and to decay in flight\nconsidering the terrestrial finite size atmosphere. Our result for Auger now,\nfor \u03a6\u03bd\u03c4 +\u03bd\u03c4 \u2243 20eV * cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 , are summarized in Fig. 3. It is evident\nthat at EeV in rock matter (as the one in Auger territory), the expected rate\nexceed one event in three years. An enhancement, made by peculiar Ande\nscreen, may amplify the rate from the West side (doubling the expected rate).\nInclined hadronic showers the more their zenith angle is large, the higher their\naltitudes take place. At highest quota (twenty-forty km), the air density is\nlow, the pair threshold increases, the Cherenkov and Fluorescent luminosity\ndecrees drastically. Moreover the distance from the high altitude till the Auger\ntelescope increase and the hadronic high altitude Showers (Hias)[9] [11] are not\n\n\f294\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n102\n\n10\n\nGZK Flux Water\nGZK Flux Rock\nGZK Flux Avg\n\n1\n\nEvent Number dN/dE E\n\n100\n\n10-1\n\n10-2\n\n10-3\n\n10-4\n\n10-5\n\n10-6\n1010\n\n1012\n\n1014\n\n1016\n1018\nFinal Tau Air Shower Energy [eV]\n\n1020\n\n1022\n\n1024\n\nFigure 3: Our expected event rate spectra on Auger sky by Fluoresce Detector\nin three years of records assuming an arrival WB neutrino flux:\u03a6\u03bd\u03c4 +\u03bd\u03c4 = 20eV *\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 . At EeV, where Auger FD the rate is NeV = 1.07 in three years;\nat 3 * 1017 eV it reaches NeV = 3.3 ; at this energy the Auger acceptance is\nnearly a third of the area, reaching once again the unity. It means that within\npresent three years, i.e. this decade, a Tau EeV event may rise in Auger sky\nwithin 2 \u2212 0.3 EeV . Additional event may occur as inclined showers on surface\ndetectors mostly arriving within the Ande shadow, a tau amplifier (doubletriple rate from West than East side) observable by FD and SD. Finally the\nextended horizontal and long tau air shower at high altitude (and low density)\nmay be partially contained in Auger,increasing the area and the estimate above.\nAir shower Cherenkov reflection on clouds may also be observable.\n\nFigure 4: Upward Tau Air showering on the Auger clouds\n\n\fD.

Therefore, even within the poor Auger\nangular telescope resolution any the inclined event within 80o \u2212 100o , being\nlong lived (because of the smaller air density ) air-showers must be indebt only\nto incoming UHE Neutrino. If upward, just tau ones.\n\n3\n\nTau Air-Showers Rate: Young, in Ande Shadows, on Auger Sky\n\nOne of the most famous signature of young Neutrino air-shower is their curvature and its time structure: it may indicate the Tau neutrino origin.[4].\nHowever it is not the unique and most powerful imprint. The Auger angular\nresolution and its limited statistics will not allow to reveal any Moon or Solar\nShadows. At least in a decade. The Ande shadow [9],[15] however is at least\na thousand times larger than moon; however on the horizons the UHECR rate\ndecreases drastically, nearly three order of magnitude; nevertheless the WestEast asymmetry would rise around 88o horizons as a few hundred missing or\nasymmetric events, making meaningful its detection in one year. It must be\nobserved soon by tuned trigger and angular resolution attention. Its discover\nis an important crosscheck of the Auger experiment. Within this Ande shadow\nhorizons taus might be better born, nearly one-two any three year, mostly in\nFD (Fluorescence Detector), but also in SD (Surface Detector); without any\ncare on thresholds it will rise more rarely. In this decade Auger may find upgoing Tau in its whole area at the rate (see Fig. 3) of N1018 eV = 1.07 event\neach three years ; at lower energy, N3*1017 eV = 3 the Auger area detection is\nreduced (\u2243 0.33), leading to an important event rate NE\u03c4 =3*1017 eV \u2243 1.1. Because additional events are un-confined (Horizontal) air-shower, this increases\nthe detection mass and its discover rate, almost doubling the expectation rate.\nMoreover the presence of an enhanced rate from Ande size on FD and SD may\nincrease the West side rate. Finally a possible discover of FD could be amplified by final flash via Cherenkov reflection on clouds (see Fig. 4). Being\ncloudy nights a third or a fourth of the whole time, this time may be an occasion to exploit even if Moon arises. In conclusion, in partial disagreement\nto some earliest[2] and most recent Auger prospects [5] requiring one or two\ndecades for a WB flux, we foresee,(in see also[17]), a sooner discover of GZK\n\u03c4 neutrino astronomy, possibly within two-three years from now. Auger may\nbe even the first experiment in the world to detect a tau natural flavor regeneration processes. To reach and speed this goal we suggest: 1) to enlarge the\ntelescope array facing towards the Ande. 2) To increase the array telescope\nangle of view, reducing the air-shower energy threshold, covering larger areas.\n3) To tune the electronic trigger of FD to horizontal air-showers. 4) To map\nthe UHECR Ande shadows at great angular resolution.\n\n\f296\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nReferences\n[1] Gandhi R. et all.

The first telescope will be settled within Autumn 2007. This paper shows the main characteristics of the experiment and its expected\nperformance.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the last fifteen years a new electromagnetic window (50 GeV - 20 TeV) has\nbeen opened thanks to the observation of the sky by ground-based Atmospheric\n\u010cerenkov Telescopes (ACT). The detection of the \u010cerenkov light produced by\nthe electrophotonic showers, originated by the interaction of \u03b3-ray photons in\nthe atmosphere, has offered spectacular breakthroughs in this extreme observational energy domain. A remarkable number of sources has been firmly detected\nsince the pioneer detection of Very High Energy (VHE) emission from the Crab\nNebula [7]. Among the most exciting recent results we cite the discovery of\nmany new sources in the Galactic plane, only some of them identified with\nknown astronomical sources, and the detection of some Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN), three of them with redshifts in the range from 0.15 to 0.2. These are\nthe three most distant extragalactic sources observed in this energy band and\ntheir detection is relevant for the evaluation of the Extragalactic Background\nLight and shows that the intergalactic space is more transparent to \u03b3-rays than\npreviously thought.\nAn increasing number of VHE experiments are now exploring the sky to\ncapture emissions in this extreme energy band. They are producing observational results useful for the understanding of the physical processes responsible\nfor the emission in AGNs and supernova remnants and helped us to study the\ncosmic-ray acceleration processes. The majority of telescopes have imaging capability (IACT), with the \u010cerenkov radiation focused onto a pixellated camera\n\n\fG. Cusumano et al.\n\nGAW, Gamma Air Watch\n\n299\n\nand the dominant cosmic-ray background is rejected by exploiting differences\nin the images from primaries \u03b3 and proton air showers [6]. The main advantages of the atmospheric \u010cerenkov technique are: high sensitivity, good angular\nresolution, moderate energy resolution and a low energy threshold that is getting closer and closer to the observational energy window of the \u03b3-ray space\nexperiments (EGRET, AGILE, GLAST-LAT). IACT, however, have a reduced\nduty cycle of about 10% and a small Field of View (FoV) of a few degree (3-5\ndegrees). The duty cycle of ACTs depends upon the constrain of moonless\nand clean nights, while their limited FoV is tied to the optical telescope design\nadopted to collect and image the light. Present IACTs , using large mirror\nreflectors, cannot reach larger FoV because of the mirror optical aberrations,\nrapidly increasing with off-axis angles. Moreover, the increasing of the detector\narea necessary to cover large FoV would inevitably produce a strong reduction\nof the light collecting area of the primary mirror because of the shadow of the\nfocal plane instrumentation onto the reflecting surface.\nA large FoV, however, is an important instrumental requirement for several\nscientific goals. VHE astronomical events, in fact, can occur at unknown locations and/or random in time and a large FoV is then mandatory to increase\ntheir detection probability. Moreover, it is also very useful to perform sensitive\nsurveys in and out of the Galactic Plane and to measure the celestial \u03b3-ray\ndiffuse emission as well. A further advantage offered by a large FoV is the\nincrease of the effective area at the highest energies: the more distant is the\ncore of the \u010cerenkov light pool from the telescope, the farther the image falls\nfrom the center of the focal plane detector. Large FoV will keep these events\ninside the detector area, increasing the sensitivity of the telescope for the most\nenergetic electromagnetic radiation.\nIn this paper we describe the main characteristics of GAW, acronym for\nGamma Air Watch, a R&D experiment that will test the feasibility of a new\ngeneration of IACT that incorporates high flux sensitivity with large FoV capability, stereoscopic observational approach and single photoelectron counting\nmode. A technical description of the GAW experiment can be found in other\ntwo papers presented at this conference [4, 1].\n2\n\nThe experiment\n\nGAW is conceived as an array composed by three identical IACTs located at\nthe vertexes of a triangle, \u223c 80 m side. A detailed description of GAW is given\nin [5].\nGAW is different from the present IACT experiments. A refractive optical\nsystem characterizes its optics system: the light collector is a non commercial\nsingle side flat Fresnel lens (\u00f8 2.13 m) with focal length of 2.55 m and thickness\nof 3.2 mm. The Fresnel lens, an approximation of the refractive aspherical lens,\n\n\f300\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nCollection Area (m2)\n\nprovides a large FoV with imaging quality suitable to the coarse structure of\nthe \u010cerenkov image and with the advantage of no central obstruction of the\nfocal plane detector. The lens is made of UltraViolet (UV) transmitting acrylic\nwith a nominal transmittance of \u223c 95% from 330 nm to the near InfraRed.\nThe material has a small refraction index derivative at low wavelength, thus\nreducing chromatic aberration effect. This will be further minimized by implementing diffractive optics design onto the side of the Fresnel lens containing\nthe grooves. The lens design is optimized at \u223c 360 nm, and it is characterized by a quite uniform spatial resolution suitable to the requirements of the\n\u010cerenkov imaging up to 12\u25e6 off-axis. The lens is made of 33 petals maintained\nin a rigid configuration by a spider structure. The optical system is designed\nand manufactured by the Fresnel Technologies, Fort Worth, Texas.\n\n105\n\n104\n\n1000\n1\n\n10\nEnergy (TeV)\n\nFigure 1: Collecting area of the GAW telescope array vs energy for on-axis\nGamma Ray events.

The focal plane detector of each\ntelescope consists of a grid of 40 \u00d7 40 Multi-Anode Photomultipliers Tubes\n(MAPMT), with 64 anodes each, arranged in 8 \u00d7 8 matrix, operated in sin-\n\n\fG. Cusumano et al.\n\nGAW, Gamma Air Watch\n\n301\n\ngle photoelectron counting mode [2] instead of the charge integration method\nwidely used in the IACT experiments. The active channels, 102400 for each\ntelescope, will record the \u010cerenkov binary image with high granularity, which\nis fundamental to minimize the probability of photoelectron pile-up within intervals shorter than the sampling time of 10 ns. In such working mode, the\nelectronic noise and the PMT gain differences are negligible, allowing to lower\nthe photoelectron trigger threshold and, as a consequent result, to achieve a\nlow telescope energy threshold in spite of the relatively small dimension of the\n\u010cerenkov light-collector. The stereoscopic observational approach will guarantee the sensitivity necessary to accomplish its feasibility and scientific goals.\nGAW will be erected in the Calar Alto Observatory (Sierra de Los Filabres\n- Andaluc\u0131\u0301a, Spain), at the altitude of 2150 m a.s.l..\nTwo phases are foreseen for the project:\nIn the first phase, only part of the GAW focal detector will be implemented\nto cover a FoV of 5\u25e6 \u00d7 5\u25e6 . The detector will be mounted on a rack frame and\nit can be moved to cover the entire focal plane. The instrumental sensitivity\nin this configuration will be tested observing the Crab Nebula on- and off-axis\nup to 12\u25e6 .\nIn the second phase the focal plane detector will be enlarged to cover a FoV\nof 24\u25e6 \u00d7 24\u25e6 . We plan to survey a sky belt with an extension of 60\u25e6 in the\nNorth-South direction.\n3\n\nGAW expected performances\n\nThe GAW expected performances were evaluated with a complete end-to-end\nsimulation. Physical processes involved in the interaction of a \u03b3-ray or a proton\nin the atmosphere, shower production and development, generation of \u010cerenkov\nlight and effects of the atmospheric absorption were simulated using the CORSIKA code [3]. The collection of the \u010cerenkov light by the stereoscopic array,\nthe optics transmission, the angular spread of the Fresnel lens, the focal plane\ndetector geometry, the quantum efficiency of the MAPMTs and the trigger\nelectronics were simulated by a proper code. The image analysis and event\nreconstruction were performed with an \"ad hoc\" procedure on the \u010cerenkov\nimages [4].\nFig. 1 shows the collection area vs. energy for mono-energetic \u03b3-ray events\ncoming from a cosmic on-axis source at the zenith and with the constraints of\ntrigger coincidence in all three telescopes. The solid line represents the collection area with a FoV of 24\u25e6 \u00d7 24\u25e6 , while the dashed line shows, for comparison,\nthe collection area with the reduced FoV of \u223c 5\u25e6 \u00d7 5\u25e6 . The advantage of a\nlarge FoV is even more striking at higher energies. The detection trigger rate\nfor a Crab-like spectrum peaks at 0.7 TeV. The main performance of GAW is\nsummarized by its integrated flux sensitivity as function of the energy.

The Milagro sensitivity is for 1 year of observation.\n\n4\n\nSummary\n\nIACTs with large FoV will offer two important advantages: they will survey\nthe sky for serendipitous TeV detections and, at the same time, will increase\nthe IACT collection area, triggering events whose core is far away from the\ntelescope axis and therefore improving the statistics of the high energy tail of\nthe source spectra.\nPresently, GAW is a R&D experiment made up of an array of three identical relatively small \u010cerenkov telescopes that will test the feasibility of a new\ngeneration IACT that joins large FoV and high flux sensitivity. Large FoV will\nbe achieved by using refractive optics made of single side flat Fresnel lens of\n\n\fG. Cusumano et al.\n\nGAW, Gamma Air Watch\n\n303\n\nmoderate size (2.13 m diameter). The focal camera will use the single photon counting mode instead of the charge integration mode widely used in the\npresent IACT experiments. This detector working mode will allow us to operate with a very low photoelectron threshold and a consequent lowering of\nthe energy threshold. The stereoscopic observational approach will improve\nthe angular resolution, the cability of identifying \u03b3-ray induced showers and a\ngood determination of the primary photon energy. In this way it will reach the\nnecessary sensitivity to accomplish the foreseen scientific goals.\nGAW is a collaboration effort of Research Institutes in Italy, Portugal and\nSpain. It will be erected in the Calar Alto Observatory (Sierra de Los Filabres\n- Andaluc\u0131\u0301a, Spain).

This energy range addresses the origin of\nPeV cosmic-rays (CRs) and the astrophysics of multi-TeV \u03b3-ray production in a growing number of astrophysical environments. Here, we\noutline the TenTen project - a proposed stereoscopic array of modestsized (10 to 30m2 ) Cherenkov imaging telescopes optimised for the E\u223c10\nto 100 TeV range. The telescopes will operate with a wide field of view\n(8\u25e6 to 10\u25e6 diameter) and the array is expected to achieve an effective\narea of \u223c10 km2 at energies above 10 TeV. A summary of the motivation\nfor TenTen and key performance parameters are given.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nGround-based \u03b3-ray astronomy operating in the \u223c0.1 to \u223c10 TeV range has\nbecome a mainstream astronomical discipline due to the exciting results from\nH.E.S.S. [21] in the Southern Hemisphere over recent years. In the Northern\nHemisphere the MAGIC [27] and MILAGRO [28] telescopes are revealing new\nsources and similar results can be expected from VERITAS [38]. The TeV\nsource catalogue extends to over 30 individual sources, and we are now able\n305\n\n\f306\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nto perform detailed studies of extreme environments capable of CR particle\nacceleration. Several lessons can be gained from the experience of H.E.S.S. and\nothers, which motivate development of a new dedicated instrument for studies\nat multi-TeV (E >few TeV) energies (see also [34, 6]):\nIncreasing variety of TeV Sources: The number of environments established as sources of gamma radiation (to energies exceeding \u223c 10 TeV in many\ncases) is growing. In the case of Galactic sources we have shell-type supernova\nremnants (SNRs), pulsar-wind-nebulae (PWN), compact binaries and/or X-ray\nbinaries, young stellar systems/clusters and molecular clouds acting as targets\nfor CRs in their vicinity. A growing number of Galactic sources (all extended)\nremain unidentified, essentially without any clear counterpart at other energies.\nThis latter issue has opened up the new sub-field of dark TeV \u03b3-ray sources.\nHard Photon Spectra: The majority of new Galactic sources exhibit hard\npower law photon spectra dN/dE \u223c E \u2212\u0393 where \u0393 < 2.5 without indication of\ncutoffs, suggesting that their emission extends beyond 10 TeV.\nExtended Sources Require Large Fields of View: The majority of Galactic sources are found to be extended up to several degrees. Morphology studies,\ncoupled with multiwavelength information, are allowing us to probe TeV \u03b3-ray\nproduction and transport processes. This activity requires large fields of view,\nnot only to encompass sources of interest but to also allow selection of regions\nfor CR background estimation and energy spectra determination. The 5\u25e6 diameter FoV of the H.E.S.S. cameras has permitted highly successful surveys of\nthe inner Southern Galactic Plane within just a few years [4, 7], and also the\nestablishment of degree-scale morphology in several strong sources.\nPresent Instruments have Limited Multi-TeV Sensitivity: Current intruments operate with a \u223c0.1 TeV threshold energy and effective collection\narea (E > 10 TeV) of less than 1 km2 . The fluxes of the new TeV sources are\nin the few to \u223c15% Crab flux range, reflecting the intrumental sensitivities.\nObservational opportunities for detailed multi-TeV studies are limited due to\nthe ever growing source catalogues at E >0.1 TeV spread across different astrophysical programmes. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of this where a new weak\nTeV source is revealed to the north of the pulsar wind nebula HESS J1825\u2212137\nafter only deep (> 50 hr) observations. Further, detailed studies of this weak\nsource, motivated perhaps by its relatively rare (at present) coincidence with a\nMeV/GeV EGRET source, would not be practical with H.E.S.S. Such studies\nwould require >100 hr of observations and face stiff competition from other\nsource programmes.\nE > 10 TeV Sources Already Exist: Several Galactic sources (two shelltype SNRs and several PWN [5, 8, 11, 9, 10]) with strong fluxes (> 15% Crab)\nand/or deep observation times (\u2265 50 hr), have established photon spectra\nreaching \u223c50 TeV or greater, demonstrating that particle acceleration to energies exceeding 100 TeV is occurring in these types of objects. MILAGRO has\n\n\fG. Rowell et al.\n\nTenTen: A new IACT array\n\n307\n\nFigure 1: H.E.S.S. image of the pulsar wind\nnebula HESS J1825\u2212137\n[9] after 52 hr observations. A weaker source\nis found to the north\nof HESS J1825\u2212137, and\nmay be a counterpart\nto the EGRET source\n3EG J1826\u22121302. This\nweaker source is unlikely\nto be studied further by\nH.E.S.S.\nalso recently revealed degree-scale emission (with total flux exceeding 1 Crab)\nat energies above 10 TeV in the Cygnus and other regions of the Northern\nGalactic Plane [1, 2], further highlighting the potential of future large-FoV\ntelescopes in the multi-TeV range.\nThere are also clear theoretical grounds for pushing deep into the multi-TeV\ndomain:\nParticle Acceleration to the knee and beyond: The desire to understand\nparticle acceleration to the CR knee (E \u223c 1 PeV) energy and beyond remains\na key motivation for multi-TeV studies. Although it is generally accepted that\nCRs can be accelerated in shell-type SNRs [19] to energies Emax \u223cfew\u00d71014 eV\n[23] (via the diffusive shock acceleration process), there is considerable uncertainty as to how particles can reach the knee energy and beyond (eg. [26, 16])\nin so-called Pevatrons. Several ideas have been put forward, for example:\nstrong amplification of pre-shock magnetic fields [12]; local Gamma-Ray-Bursts\n(GRBs) [37, 15]; and superbubbles which combine the effects of many SNRs\nand maybe Wolf-Rayet/OB stellar winds [17, 14, 30, 13]. Extragalactic sources\nwith large-scale kpc shocks such as galaxy clusters (eg. [39]) and AGN jets and\ngiant lobes (eg. [22]) could also contribute. Only with observations at around\n\u2265100 TeV can we begin to solve the mystery of PeV CR acceleration.\nE > 10 TeV - Easier Separation of Hadronic & Electronic Components: A major complication in interpreting present results in the 0.1 to\n\u223c10 TeV range concerns the separation of \u03b3-ray components from accelerated\nhadrons (from secondary \u03c0 \u25e6 -decay) and those from accelerated electrons (usually from inverse-Compton scattering). Multiwavelength information at radio\nand X-ray energies for example, can provide constraints on these components\nbut often one requires model-dependent assumptions to decide the nature of\n\n\f308\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nthe parent particles. At energies E >10 TeV the electronic component can be\nsuppressed due to strong radiative synchrotron energy losses suffered by electrons in magnetised post-shock environments, such as that in shell-type SNRs.\nIn addition, the Klein-Nishina effect on the inverse-Compton cross-section can\nsignificantly reduce the efficiency of this process. Except in those cases where a\nstrong source of electrons exists, such as in PWN, interpretation of E > 10 TeV\nspectra may therefore be much more confidently interpreted as arising from accelerated hadrons. Such hadronic/electronic separation also allows us to study\nin detail the astrophysics of accelerated electrons in multi-TeV sources.\nProbing Local Intergalactic/Interstellar Photon Fields: E > 10 TeV\nphotons indirectly allow us to probe ambient soft photon fields. In the \u223c10 to\n\u223c100 TeV energy range, absorption on the cosmic infra-red background (CIB)\nin the 10 to 100 \u03bcm range dominates with mean free paths extending beyond\n1 Mpc. Constraints on the (nearby) intergalactic CIB via \u03b3-ray spectral studies of nearby extragalactic sources, such as M 87 (an established TeV source)\ncan yield important information concerning star and galaxy formation in our\nlocal intergalactic neighbourhood [3]. Constraints on the interstellar CIB may\nalso be possible via E > 10 TeV spectral studies of multi-TeV Galactic source\npopulations [29].\n2\n\nTenTen: Initial Simulation Study & Performance\n\nGiven that source fluxes rapidly decrease with energy, any dedicated instrument\noperating in the multi-TeV energy domain must have a very large effective collection area Aeff \u223c10 km2 or greater. While there are several ways to achieve\n10 km2 using ground-based techniques, earlier simulations [31] have shown that\na proven, technically straightforward, and highly sensitive method would employ stereoscopy in an array of 30 to 50 modest-sized imaging atmospheric\nCherenkov telescopes (IACTs) in a cell-based approach. Each telescope would\nhave mirror area 10 to 30 m2 , field of view (FoV) 5\u25e6 to 10\u25e6 , and inter-telescope\nspacing within a single cell \u2265200 metres (compared to \u223c100 m employed by\narrays such as H.E.S.S.). The large FoV, limited practically by optical aberrations, allows events to trigger out to core distances \u2265200 m, thereby increasing\nthe effective collection area of a cell. We propose here such an array, known\nas TenTen, which stands for 10 km2 above 10 TeV. Similar and other ideas for\n100 TeV studies have also been suggested [25, 40, 24].\nOur initial simulation study [33] looked at the performance of a single cell of\n5 telescopes, each with mirror area 23.8 m2 (84x60 cm diameter spherical mirror\nfacets), f/1.5 optics, and 1024 pixel camera spanning 8.2\u25e6 diameter (with pixel\ndiameter 0.25\u25e6 ). The optics were based on an elliptical dish profile outlined\nin [35], and provide an 80% containment diameter \u2264 0.25\u25e6 out to \u223c 4\u25e6 offaxis. The layout of the cell has the outer four telescopes arranged in a square\n\n\fG.

A cell side length L in the range 200 to 500 metres has so far been\nsimulated in our initial study. Right: True core locations of triggered events for\na cell of side length L=300 m. Trigger conditions are given in text. Telescope\npositions are represented by the large red dots (the array is rotated 90\u25e6 with\nrespect to the left panel) with 1-10 TeV events shown as small green dots, and\n10-100 TeV events shown as small blue dots.\n\nof side length L with a single telescope at the centre (see Fig. 2 Left panel),\nnot unlike the HEGRA IACT-System layout [32]. Gamma-ray and proton\nextensive air shower simulations (30\u25e6 zenith - with CORSIKA v6.204 [20]\nand SIBYLL [18]) coupled with telescope responses (based on [36]) were used\nto investigate basic performance parameters of the cell. An observation altitude\n200 m a.s.l. was chosen since we are investigating sites in Australia. For E >\n10 TeV, low-altitude sites are beneficial in terms of collection area compared to\nmid/high altitudes due to the larger distances between telescopes and shower\nmaxima. Using a fixed ADC gate of 20 ns (similar to H.E.S.S. electronics)\nand a conservative trigger setup (pixel threshold of 12 photoelectrons in \u22652\npixels, image size\u226560 photoelectrons, image dis<3.5\u25e6 and stereo trigger of \u22652\ntelescopes) we found that for a cell with side length L = 300 m, an on-axis \u03b3-ray\neffective collection area Aeff exceeding 1 km2 for E > 30 TeV can be achieved\nin a single cell (see Fig. 3). The large FoV is a key factor in allowing events\nto be triggered out to core distances approaching 800 m from the cell centre\n(Fig. 2 Right panel). In addition, similar cosmic-ray background rejection\npower (based on scaled width) and \u223c6 arc-minute angular resolution is achieved\nin the E > 10 TeV range as H.E.S.S. and the HEGRA IACT-System achieve in\ntheir respective energy ranges. An energy threshold in the 1 to few TeV range\nis also indicated, depending on the cell side length L. This encouraging result\n\n\f310\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 3: Effective area (km2 ) vs energy E (TeV) for a 5-telescope cell of side\nlength L=300 m, at 200 m above sea level (Large black filled cirles). Telescopes\nof total mirror area 23.8 m2 , coupled to a focal plane array of 1024 pixels\nspanning \u223c 8\u25e6 field of view were used, along with trigger conditions described\nin text. This can be compared to the effective area achieved by H.E.S.S. (small\nred solid circles).\nsuggests that expanding the array to (for example) \u223c10 cells sufficiently spaced\nso that there are no common events between cells could yield collection areas\n\u223c10 km2 , exceeding that of H.E.S.S. by factors approaching 50 at 100 TeV.\nThe approximate flux sensitivity (based on the improvement in collection area\nfor 10 cells over H.E.S.S.) and energy coverage of a 10 cell TenTen array is\ndepicted in Fig. 4. Flux sensitivities for large extended sources such as the 2\u25e6\ndiameter shell type SNR RX J0852.0\u22124622 would be \u223c 10\u221212 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at\n10 TeV. For point-like sources, the accessible fluxes would be a factor of 10 to\n20 lower again (less than \u223c 10\u221213 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 above 10 TeV). A 1 TeV to\na few TeV energy threshold would also allow detailed studies of existing \u03b3-ray\nsources that are at the flux threshold of detection for H.E.S.S. Even though\nour simulations were limited to E \u2264 100 TeV, we also expect a high collection\narea above this energy.\n3\n\nSummary & Conclusions\n\nWe have described the motivation and some important performance parameters\nfor a new array of IACTs achieving 10 km2 at E > 10 TeV. This proposed\narray, known as TenTen, will be dedicated to multi-TeV astronomy, and based\non results from H.E.S.S., is expected to yield new insights into PeV particle\nacceleration and multi-TeV astrophysics.

We review the formation scenarios of spikes and mini-spikes and\ndiscuss the implications for indirect Dark Matter searches with existing\nand upcoming experiments such as GLAST and PAMELA.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAlthough many astrophysical and cosmological observations provide convincing\nevidence for the existence of a \"dark\" component in the matter density of the\nUniverse, the nature of this dark matter (DM) remains unkown. It is commonly\nassumed that DM is made of new, as yet undiscovered, particles, associated\nwith theories beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Among the most\nwidely studied candidates are the supersymmetric neutralino and candidates\narising in theories with extra-dimensions, which appear difficult to constrain\nwith direct searches (i.e. by looking for nuclear recoils due to DM particles\nscattering off nuclei) and whose prospects of discovery at future accelerators\nstrongly depend on the details of the particle physics setup (for recent reviews\nsee e.g. Refs. [1, 2]). Indirect searches via the detection of annihilation radiation\nmay provide an interesting alternative, but they are usually affected by large\nastrophysical and cosmological uncertainties. Furthermore, in many cases, the\n313\n\n\f314\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\ndetection of an annihilation signal may be difficult to distinguish from less\nexotic astrophysical sources. Recenty, new scenarios have been discussed in\nliterature, where the formation of Massive Black Holes leads to strong DM\noverdensities called \"spikes\", that might be observed as point sources of gammarays [16] and neutrinos [22]. We show here that spikes and mini-spikes may\nlead to a dramatic enhancement of gamma-ray and antimatter fluxes, bringing\nthem within the reach of current and upcoming experiments.\n2\n\nSpikes\n\nThe effect of the formation of a central object on the surrounding distribution of\nmatter has been investigated in Refs. [4] and for the first time in the framework\nof DM annihilations in Ref. [5]. It was shown that the adiabatic growth of a\nmassive object at the center of a power-law distribution of DM, with index\n\u03b3, induces a redistribution of matter into a new power-law (dubbed \"spike\")\nwith index \u03b3sp = (9 \u2212 2\u03b3)/(4 \u2212 \u03b3). This formula is valid over a region of size\nRsp \u2248 0.2 rBH , where rBH is the radius of gravitational influence of the black\nhole, defined implicitly as M (< rBH ) = MBH , where M (< r) denotes the mass\nof the DM distribution within a sphere of radius r, and where MBH is the mass\nof the Black Hole [6]. The process of adiabatic growth is in particular valid\nfor the SMBH at the galactic center. A critical assessment of the formation\nand survival of the central spike, over cosmological timescales, is presented in\nRefs. [8, 7] \u2013 see also references therein. We limit ourselves here to note that\nadiabatic spikes are rather fragile structures, that require fine-tuned conditions\nto form at the center of galactic halos [9], and that can be easily destroyed by\ndynamical processes such as major mergers [10] and gravitational scattering off\nstars [11, 8].\nIt was recently shown that a \u03c1 \u221d r3/2 DM overdensity can be predicted\nin any halo at the center of any galaxy old enough to have grown a powerlaw density cusp in the stars via the Bahcall-Wolf mechanism [12]. Collisional\ngeneration of these DM \"crests\" \u2013 Collisionally REgenerated STructures \u2013 was\ndemonstrated even in the extreme case where the DM density was lowered\nby slingshot ejection from a binary supermassive black hole. However, the\nenhancement of the annihilation signal from a DM crest is typically much\nsmaller than for adiabatic spikes [12].\n3\n\nMini-Spikes\n\nIf intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), with a mass ranging between 102\nand 106 M\u2299 (e.g. [3]), exist in the Galaxy, their adiabatic growth would have\nmodified the DM distribution around them, leading to the formation of \"minispikes\". The DM annihilation rate being proportional to the square of the\n\n\fG. Bertone\n\nSpikes and Mini-Spikes\n\n315\n\nnumber density of DM particles, these mini-spikes would be bright gamma-ray\nsources, distributed in a roughly spherically-symmetric way about the galactic\ncenter, and well within the observational reach of the next-generation gammaray experiments. Their brightness and isotropy make them ideal targets of large\nfield-of-view gamma-ray experiments such as GLAST [15]. In case of a positive\ndetection, Air Cherenkov Telescopes such as CANGAROO [17], HESS [18],\nMAGIC [19] and VERITAS [20] could extend the observations to higher energies and improve the angular resolution. Mini-spikes could also be detectable\nwith neutrino experiments such as Antares and IceCube. Furthermore they\nmay also lead to strong enhancements of anti-matter fluxes, within the reach\nof experiments such as PAMELA. The observation of numerous (up to \u223c 100)\npoint-like gamma-ray sources with identical cut-offs in their energy spectra, at\nan energy equal to the mass of the DM particle, would provide smoking-gun\nevidence for DM particles.\nMini-spikes result from the reaction of DM mini-halos to the formation or\ngrowth of IMBHs. To make quantitative predictions, we focus on a specific\nIMBHs formation scenario [13], representative of a class of models where these\nobjects form directly out of cold gas in early-forming DM halos, and are characterized by a large mass scale, of order 105 M\u2299 (see also Ref. [14] and references\ntherein). In Fig. 1 we show the distribution of these IMBHs as obtained in\n\nFigure 1: Sky map in equatorial coordinates showing the position of Intermediate Mass Black Holes in one random realization of a Milky-Way like halo\n(red diamonds), and in all 200 realizations (blue dots). The concentration at\nnegative declinations corresponds to the position of the Galactic center (black\nopen diamond). From Ref. [22]\n\n\f316\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nRef. [22], which is based on the Monte Carlo halo evolution procedure given in\nRef. [23]. The method for populating black holes at high-redshift are described\nin detail in Refs. [24, 16].\nMini-spikes would be copious sources of Dark Matter annihilation products, such as gamma-rays, neutrinos, anti-protons and positrons , which can\nbe produced either directly, or through fragmentation and decay of secondary\nparticles such as quarks, leptons and gauge bosons. If Ni (E) is the spectrum\nof secondary particles of species i per annihilation, the flux from an individual\nmini-spike can be expressed as [16]\n\u22122\n\u03a60\u03bdl (E) = \u03c60 m\u22122\n\u03c7,100 (\u03c3v)26 Dkpc Lsp Ni (E)\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03c60 = 9 \u00d7 10\u221210 cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The first two factors depend on the particle\nphysics parameters, viz. the mass of the DM particle in units of 100 GeV\nm\u03c7,100 , and its annihilation cross section in units of 10\u221226 cm3 /s, (\u03c3v)26 , while\nthe third factor accounts for the flux dilution with the square of the IMBH\ndistance to the Earth in kpc, Dkpc . Finally, the normalization of the flux is\nfixed by an adimensional luminosity factor Lsp , that depends on the specific\nproperties of individual spikes. In the case where the DM profile before the\nformation of the IMBH follows the commonly adopted Navarro, Frenk and\nWhite profile [25], the final DM density \u03c1(r) around the IMBH will be described\nby a power law r\u22127/3 in a region of size Rs around the IMBHs. Annihilations\nthemselves will set an upper limit to the DM density \u03c1max \u2248 m\u03c7 /[(\u03c3v)t], where\nt is the time elapsed since the formation of the mini-spike, and we denote with\nRc the \"cut\" radius where \u03c1(Rc ) = \u03c1max . With these definitions, the intrinsic\nluminosity factor in Eq. 1 reads\n14/3 \u22125/3\nLsp \u2261 \u03c12100 (Rs )Rs,pc\nRc,mpc\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Rs,pc and Rc,mpc denote respectively Rs in parsecs and Rc in units of\n10\u22123 pc, \u03c1100 (r) is the density in units of 100GeV cm\u22123 . Typical values of Lsp\nlie in the range 0.1 \u2013 10 [16]. To estimate the flux, we need now to specify the\ngamma-ray spectrum per annihilation dN/dE, which depends on the nature\nof the DM particle. In most scenarios, direct annihilation in two photons is\nseverely suppressed, but a continuum spectrum is expected from the decay of\nsecondary neutral pions.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the (average) integrated luminosity function of IMBHs in\none of the scenarios discussed in Ref. [16]. We define the integrated luminosity\nfunction as the number of black holes producing a gamma-ray flux larger than\n\u03a6, as a function of \u03a6. The upper (lower) line corresponds to m\u03c7 = 100 GeV,\n\u03c3v = 3\u00d710\u221226 cm3 s\u22121 ( m\u03c7 = 1 TeV, \u03c3v = 10\u221229 cm3 s\u22121 ). In a practical sense,\nthe plot shows the number of IMBHs that can be detected with experiments\nwith point source sensitivity \u03a6 above 1 GeV. We show for comparison the point\nsource sensitivity above 1 GeV for EGRET and GLAST, corresponding roughly\n\n\fG.

Note that the fluxes scale in this case as \u223c (\u03c3v)2/7 m\u03c7 ,\ndue to the implicit dependence of rcut on \u03c3v and m.\nThe number of detectable sources is very high, even in the pessimistic case,\nand either strong constraints on a combination of the astrophysics and particle\nphysics of this scenario, or an actual detection, should be possible within the\nfirst year of operation of GLAST, which is expected to be launched in 2007.\n\nFigure 2: IMBHs integrated luminosity function, i.e. number of black holes\nproducing a gamma-ray flux larger than a given flux, as a function of the flux.\nThe upper (lower) line corresponds to m\u03c7 = 100 GeV, \u03c3v = 3 \u00d7 10\u221226 cm3\ns\u22121 (m\u03c7 = 1 TeV, \u03c3v = 10\u221229 cm3 s\u22121 ). For each curve we also show the 1-\u03c3\nscatter among different realizations of Milky Way-sized host DM halos. We\nshow for comparison the 5\u03c3 point source sensitivity above 1 GeV of EGRET\nand GLAST (1 year). From Ref. [16].\nThe prospects for detecting high energy neutrinos from mini-spikes are also\ninteresting. The results are shown in Fig. 3, where we plot the number of black\nholes producing a rate of events R, or larger, in ANTARES and IceCube, assuming m\u03c7 = 1 TeV, and \u03c3v = 1026 cm3 s\u22121 . For comparison, we show the rate\nof atmospheric neutrino events in a search cone of size 1\u25e6 around the source, for\nAntares and for a kilometer-scale telescope. For the atmospheric background\nin Antares we have adopted the value derived in a dedicated study [26], relative\nto a point source coincident with the Galactic center, while for kilometer scale\ntelescopes, we have used the so-called Bartol flux [27], and a source at the same\ndeclination.\nThe presence of mini-spikes may have important consequences for indirect\nDM searches based on exotic contributions to anti-matter fluxes, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations involving 106 realizations of the IMBHs population have been per-\n\n\f318\n\nScience with the New Generation of High Energy Experiments\n\nFigure 3: Number of IMBHs producing a rate R, or larger, in Antares, IceCube\nand Km3. Solid lines corresponds to the average over all realizations, while\ndashed line denote the 1-\u03c3 scatter from one simulation to another. For reference\nwe show the rate induced by atmospheric neutrinos in Antares (vertical dotted)\nand Km3 (vertical dashed) in a 1\u25e6 cone around a source located at the Galactic\ncenter.\n\nformed in Ref. [30]. The distribution of the resulting boost factors (for positron\nflux) at the Earth is sketched in Fig. 4 as a function of energy. The shaded\narea show the region where the boost factor is expected to lie, with a 1-\u03c3 and\n2-\u03c3 confidence level. The yellow (grey) areas correspond to the 1 \u03c3 region, the\nlighter one being obtained by fixing the annihilation volumes \u03bei to their mean\nexpected value, while the darker one corresponds to the general case for which\nmini-spikes have different values of \u03bei . In both cases, the dot-dashed curves\nstand for the 1 \u03c3 contours obtained analytically. These curves are in good\nagreement with the ones obtained from the Monte Carlo, the small increase of\nthe variance for the Monte Carlo with respect to the analytical expectation is\ndue to the number of black holes that vary from one Monte Carlo realization\nto another, while this effect is not implemented in the analytical determination\nof the boost factor. The fact that these curves are fairly close to each other\nconfirms that the dispersion of the number NBH of IMBHs in the Milky Way\npoorly influences the final dispersion of the boost. This figure also shows that\nthe boost factor can be very large, the expected value being of order 8000 (for\na DM particle mass of 1 TeV).\nFinally, we stress that the identification of the exotic nature of mini-spikes\nas gamma-ray sources would be made easier if these object were detected in\nthe Adromeda Galaxy [31].\n\n\fG.
