By C(x|n) we mean conditional complexity of x when n is given, see for ex\u2032\nample Li and Vitanyi [6]. Superscript 0\u2032 in C0 means that we consider the relativized version\nof complexity to the oracle 0\u2032 , the universal computably enumerable set.\nThe following result was proved in Vereshchagin [13]. We provide a simple proof for it.\nTheorem 1 For all x \u2208 {0, 1}\u2217 :\n\u2032\n\nlim sup C(x|n) = C0 (x) + O(1).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(In this theorem and below \" f (x) = g(x) + O(1)\" means that there is a constant c such that\n| f (x) \u2212 g(x)| 6 c for all x.)\nProof. We start in the easy direction. Let 0n be the (finite) set consisting of the elements of\nthe universal enumerable set 0\u2032 that have been enumerated after n steps of computation (note\n\u2032\nthat 0n can be computed from n). If C0 (x) 6 k, then there exists a description (program) of\nsize at most k that generates x using 0\u2032 as an oracle. Only finite part of the oracle can be used\nin the computation that produces x, so 0\u2032 can be replaced by 0n for all sufficiently large n, and\noracle 0n can be reconstructed if n is given as a condition. Therefore, C(x|n) 6 k + O(1) for all\nsufficiently large n, and\n\u2032\nlim sup C(x|n) 6 C0 (x) + O(1).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nFor the reverse inequality, fix k and assume that lim sup C(x|n) < k. This means that for all\nsufficiently large n the string x belongs to the set\nUn = {u | C(u|n) < k}.\nThe family Un is an enumerable family of sets (given n and k, we can generate Un ); each of\nthese sets has at most 2k elements. We need to construct a 0\u2032 -computable process that given\nk generates at most 2k elements including all elements that belong to Un for all sufficiently\nlarge n. (Then strings of length k may be assigned as 0\u2032 -computable codes of all generated\nelements.)\nTo describe this process, consider the following operation: for some u and N add u to all\nUn such that n > N. (In other terms, we add a horizontal ray starting from (N, u) to the set\nU = {(n, u) | u \u2208 Un }.) This operation is acceptable if all Un still have at most 2k elements\nafter it (i.e., if before this operation all Un such that n > N either contain u or have strictly less\nthan 2k elements).\nFor any given triple u, N, k, we can find out using 0\u2032 -oracle whether this operation is acceptable or not. Indeed, the operation is not acceptable if and only if some Un for n > N contains at\nleast 2k elements that are distinct from u. Formally, the operation is not acceptable if\n(\u2203n > N) |Un \\ {u}| > 2k ,\nand this is an enumerable condition as the Un are themselves enumerable. Now for all pairs\n(N, u) (in some computable order) we perform the (N, u)-operation if it is acceptable. (The\n2\n\n\felements added to some Ui remain there and are taken into account when next operations are\nattempted.) This process is 0\u2032 -computable since after any finite number of operations the set U\nis enumerable (without any oracle) and its enumeration algorithm can be 0\u2032 -effectively found\n(uniformly in k).\nTherefore the set of all elements u that participate in acceptable operations during this\nprocess is uniformly 0\u2032 -enumerable. This set contains at most 2k elements (otherwise Un would\nbecome too big for large n). Finally, this set contains all u such that u belongs to the (original)\nUn for all sufficiently large n. Indeed, the operation is always acceptable if the element we want\nto add is already present! \u0003\nThe proof has the following structure. We have an enumerable family of sets Un that all\nhave at most 2k elements. This implies that the set\nU\u221e = lim inf Un\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nhas at most 2k elements where, as usual, the lim inf of a sequence of sets is the set of elements\nthat belong to almost all sets of the sequence. If U\u221e were 0\u2032 -enumerable, we would be done.\nHowever, this may be not the case: the criterion\nu \u2208 U\u221e \u21d4 \u2203N (\u2200n > N) [u \u2208 Un ]\nhas \u2203\u2200 prefix before an enumerable (not necessarily decidable) relation, that is, one quantifier\nmore than we want (to guarantee that U\u221e is 0\u2032 -enumerable). However, in our proof we managed\nto cover U\u221e by a set that is 0\u2032 -enumerable and still has at most 2k elements.\n\n2 Prefix complexity and a priori probability\nWe now prove a similar result for prefix complexity (or, in other terms, for a priori probability).\nLet us recall the definition. The function a(x) on binary strings (or integers) with non-negative\nreal values is called a semimeasure if \u2211x a(x) 6 1. The function a is lower semicomputable\nif there exists a computable total function (x, n) 7\u2192 a(x, n) with rational values such that for\nevery x the sequence a(x, 0), a(x, 1), . . . is a nondecreasing sequence that has limit a(x).\nThere exists a maximal (up to a constant factor) lower semicomputable semimeasure m\n(see, e.g., Li and Vitanyi [6]). The value m(x) is sometimes called the a priori probability of x.\nIn the same way we can define conditional a priory probability m(x|n) and 0\u2032 -relativized a pri\u2032\nori probability m0 (x) (which is a maximal semimeasure among the 0\u2032 -lower semicomputable\nones).\nTheorem 2 For all x \u2208 {0, 1}\u2217 :\n\u2032\n\nlim inf m(x|n) = m0 (x)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nup to a \u0398(1) multiplicative factor (in other terms, two inequalities with O(1) factors hold).\n\u2032\n\nProof. If m0 (x) is greater than some \u03b5 , then for sufficiently large n the value m0n (x) is also\ngreater than \u03b5 . (Indeed, this inequality is established at some finite stage when only a finite\npart of 0\u2032 is used.) We may assume without loss of generality that the function x 7\u2192 mA (x)\n3\n\n\fis a semimeasure for any A (recalling the construction of the maximal semimeasure). Then,\nsimilarly to the previous theorem, we have\n\u2032\n\nlim inf m(x|n) > lim inf m0n (x) > m0 (x)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nup to constant multiplicative factors. Indeed, for the first inequality, notice that we can define\na conditional lower semicomputable semimeasure \u03bc by \u03bc (x|n) = m0n (x). By maximality of m,\nwe have \u03bc (x|n) \u2264 m(x|n) for all x, n, up to a multiplicative factor. For the second inequality, re\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncall that m0 (x) is the nondecreasing limit of an 0\u2032 -computable sequence m0 (x, 0), m0 (x, 1), . . ..\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLet s be such that m0 (x, s) \u2265 12 m0 (x). Since the computation of m0 (x, s) only uses finitely\n\u2032\n\u2032\nmany bits of 0\u2032 , we have for all large enough n: m0n (x, s) = m0 (x, s) \u2265 21 m0 (x) and thus\n\u2032\nm0n (x) \u2265 21 m0 (x).\nThe other direction of the proof is also similar to the second part of the proof of Theorem 1.\nInstead of enumerable finite sets Un we now have a sequence of (uniformly) lower semicomputable functions x 7\u2192 mn (x) = m(x|n). Each of the mn is a semimeasure. We need to construct\nan 0\u2032 -lower semicomputable semimeasure m\u2032 such that\nm\u2032 (x) > lim inf mn (x)\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nAgain, the lim inf itself cannot be used as m\u2032 : we do have \u2211x lim infn mn (x) 6 1 as \u2211x mn (x) 6 1\nfor all n, but unfortunately the equivalence\nr < lim inf mn (x) \u21d4 (\u2203r\u2032 > r)(\u2203N) (\u2200n > N) [r\u2032 < mn (x)]\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nhas too many quantifier alternations (one more than needed; note that the quantity mn (x) is\nlower semicomputable making the [. . .] condition enumerable). The similar trick helps. For a\ntriple (r, N, u) consider an increase operation that increases all values mn (u) such that n > N up\nto a given rational number r (not changing them if they were greater than or equal to r). This\noperation is acceptable if all mn remain semimeasures after the increase.\nThe question whether the increase operation is acceptable is 0\u2032 -decidable. And if it is\nacceptable, by performing it we get a new (uniformly) lower semicomputable sequence of\nsemimeasures. We can then try to perform an increase operation for some other triple. Doing that for all triples (in some computable ordering), we can then define m\u2032 (u) as the upper\nbound of r for all successful (r, N, u) increase operations (for all N). This gives a 0\u2032 -lower semicomputable function; it is a semimeasure since we verify the semimeasure inequality for every\nsuccessful increase attempt; finally, m\u2032 (u) > lim inf mn (u) since if mn (u) > r for all n > N, then\nthe (r, N, u)-increase does not change anything and is guaranteed to be acceptable at any step. \u0003\nThe expression \u2212 log m(x), where m is the maximal lower semicomputable semimeasure,\nequals the so-called prefix complexity K(x) (up to an additive O(1) term; see for example Li\nand Vitanyi [6]). The same is true for relativized and conditional versions, and we get the\nfollowing reformulation of the last theorem:\nTheorem 3\n\n\u2032\n\nlim sup K(x|n) = K 0 (x) + O(1).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n4\n\n\fAnother corollary improves a result of Muchnik [8]. For any (partial) function f from N to\nN let us define the limit frequency q f (x) of an integer x as\nq f (x) = lim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n#{i < n | f (i) = x}\nn\n\nIn other words, we look at the fraction of values x among the first n values f (0), . . ., f (n \u2212 1)\nof f (undefined values are also listed) and take the lim inf of these fractions. It is easy to see\nthat for a total computable f the function q f is a lower 0\u2032 -semicomputable semimeasure. Moreover, it is shown in Muchnik [8] that any 0\u2032 -semicomputable semimeasure \u03bc can be represented\nas \u03bc = q f for some computable function f . In particular this implies that there exists a total\n\u2032\ncomputable function f such that q f = m0 .\nWe would like to extend Muchnik's result to partial computable functions f . The problem\nis that if f is only partial computable, the function q f is no longer guaranteed to be lower\nsemicomputable. Using the second part of the proof of Theorem 2, we can nonetheless prove:\nTheorem 4 For any partial computable function f , the function q f is upper bounded by a\nlower 0\u2032 -semicomputable semimeasure.\nProof. Indeed, given a partial computable function f , we can define for all n a semimeasure \u03bcn as\n#{i < n | f (i) = x}\n\u03bcn (x) =\n;\nn\n\u03bcn is lower semicomputable uniformly in n. Then q f = lim inf \u03bcn ; on the other hand we know\nfrom the proof of Theorem 2 that the lim inf of a sequence of (uniformly) lower semicomputable\nsemimeasures is bounded by a 0\u2032 -lower semicomputable semimeasure. The result follows. \u0003\nThe same type of argument also is applicable to the so-called a priori complexity defined\nas negative logarithm of a maximal lower semicomputable semimeasure on the binary tree (see\nZvonkin and Levin [14]). This complexity is sometimes denoted as KA (x) and we get the\nfollowing statement:\nTheorem 5\n\n\u2032\n\nlim sup KA (x|n) = KA 0 (x) + O(1).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n(To prove this we define an increase operation in such a way that, for a given lower semicomputable semimeasure on the binary tree a, it increases not only a(x) but also a(y) for y that\nare prefixes of x, if necessary. The increase is acceptable if a(\u039b) still does not exceed 1.)\nIt would be interesting to find out whether similar results are true for monotone complexity\nor not (the authors do not know this).\n\n3 Open sets of small measure\nIn Section 1 we covered the lim inf of a sequence of finite uniformly enumerable sets Ui by a\n0\u2032 -enumerable set V that is essentially no bigger than the Ui . It was done in a uniform way,\n5\n\n\fi.e., V can be effectively constructed given the enumerations of the Ui and an upper bound for\ntheir cardinalities. We now look at the continuous version of this problem where the Ui are\nopen sets of small measure.\nWe consider open sets in the Cantor space {0, 1}\u221e (the set of all infinite sequences of zeros\nand ones). An interval [x] (for a binary string x) is formed by all sequences that have prefix x.\nOpen sets are unions of intervals. An effectively open subset of {0, 1}\u221e is an enumerable union\nof intervals, i.e., the union of intervals [x] where strings x are taken from some enumerable set.\nWe consider standard (uniform Bernoulli) measure on {0, 1}\u221e: the interval [x] has measure\n\u2212l\n2 where l is the length of x.\nA classical theorem of measure theory says:\nif U0 ,U1 ,U2, . . . are open sets of measure at most \u03b5 , then lim infn Un has measure at\nmost \u03b5 , and this implies that for every \u03b5 \u2032 > \u03b5 there exists an open set of measure at\nmost \u03b5 \u2032 that covers lim infn Un .\nIndeed,\nlim inf Un =\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n[ \\\n\nUn ,\n\nN n>N\n\nand the measure of the union of an increasing sequence\nVN =\n\n\\\n\nUn ,\n\nn>N\n\nequals the limit of measures of VN , and all these measures do not exceed \u03b5 since VN \u2282 UN .\nRecall also that for any measurable subset X of {0, 1}\u221e its measure \u03bc (X ) is the infimum of the\nmeasures of open sets that cover X .\nWe now can \"effectivize\" this statement in the same way as we did before. In Section 1 we\nstarted with an (evident) statement: if Un are finite sets of at most 2k elements, then lim infn Un\nhas at most 2k elements and proved its effective (in the halting problem) version: for a uniformly\nenumerable family of finite sets Un that have at most 2k elements, the set lim infn Un is contained\nin a uniformly 0\u2032 -enumerable set that has at most 2k elements.\nIn Section 2 we did a similar thing with semimeasures. Again, the non-effective version\nis trivial: it says that if \u2211x mn (x) 6 1 for every n, then \u2211x lim infn mn (x) 6 1. We have proved\nthe effective version that provides a 0\u2032 -semicomputable semimeasure that is an upper bound for\nlim infmn .\nFor the statement about lim infUn , the effective version is the following statement, proved\nin full generality by Conidis [3]. (In the previous version of this paper only a much weaker and\nmore obscure statement was proven, and the full version was formulated as a conjecture.)\nTheorem 6 (Conidis) Let \u03b5 > 0 be a rational number and let U0 ,U1, . . . be an enumerable\nfamily of effectively open sets of measure at most \u03b5 each. Then for every rational \u03b5 \u2032 > \u03b5\nthere exists a 0\u2032 -effectively open set V of measure at most \u03b5 \u2032 that contains lim infn\u2192\u221e Un =\nS T\n\u2032\n\u2032\nN n>N Un , and the 0 -enumeration algorithm for V can be effectively found given \u03b5 , \u03b5 , and\nthe enumeration algorithm for Ui .\nProof. Let us first try the same trick as above. For every interval [x] and for every natural\ni we may try to add [x] to all Ui ,Ui+1, . . . and see whether the restriction on the measure of\nUn is now violated (i.e., some of the enlarged Un have now measure greater than \u03b5 ). This can\n6\n\n\fbe effectively tested with the help of 0\u2032 -oracle. If the restriction is violated, this pair (x, i) is\nignored; if the restriction is still satisfied, we add [x] to all Ui ,Ui+1 , . . . and use the enlarged sets\nin the sequel.\nThe process is 0\u2032 -computable, and the union of all added intervals is an 0\u2032 -effectively open\nset of measure at most \u03b5 . However, trying to prove that this open set covers lim infUn (i.e.,\ncovers VN for all N, see above), we encounter a problem. We can be sure that some pair (x, N)\nis accepted (and the interval [x] is added starting from Nth position) if [x] already belongs to\nUN ,UN+1 , . . .; in this case [x] is a subset of Int(VN ). (By Int X we mean a maximal open subset\nof X .) So this reasoning gives only a weaker statement (proved in [2]): the set\n[\n\\\n\u0001\nInt\nUn\nN\n\nn>N\n\ncan be covered by a 0\u2032 -effectively open set of small measure.\nTo get a desired statement, we need do modify the procedure. This modification was suggested by Bruno Bauwens [1]. (The original proof of Conidis is indirect: he first covers the\nrequired set up to a null set.)\nFirst, we need some tolerance to the measure increase when we attempt to add some interval\n[x] starting from the set number i: the threshold (initially \u03b5 ) increases at this step by some \u03b4x,i .\nThe computable family of rational numbers \u03b4x,i > 0 is selected in such a way that the sum of\nall \u03b4x,i does not exceed \u03b5 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b5 .\nSecond, after we see that the attempt (to add [x] to Ui ,Ui+1 , . . .) is unsuccessful because the\n(increased) threshold is crossed, we do not give up. Instead, we select a first m for which Um\nbecomes too big after adding [x], and replace [x] by [x] \u2229 Um : we then try to add [x] \u2229 Um to\nUi ,Ui+1 , . . . instead of [x]. May be again the attempt is unsuccessful and some Ut (for some\nt > m) again crosses the same threshold. Then we take the intersection [x] \u2229 Um \u2229 Ut and so\non. Note that each new intersection operation decreases the size of the added set by \u03b4x,i , since\nthe outstanding part, now eliminated, was at least of this size. So this process of \"trimming\" is\nfinite and at some point we add the trimmed set [x] \u2229Um \u2229Ut \u2229 . . . \u2229Uv without exceeding the\nthreshold.\nIt remains to show that in this way we indeed cover lim infUn . Indeed, assume that some\nsequence \u03b1 belongs to all UN ,UN+1 , . . .. Then, starting to add some interval containing \u03b1 to\nUN ,UN+1 , . . ., we will never remove \u03b1 by trimming, so \u03b1 will be covered. \u0003\nRemark. In fact the intervals [x] are not needed in this argument, we can start every time\nfrom the entire Cantor space. Then the proof can be reformulated as follows. Let us denote\nby Uk..l the intersection Uk \u2229Uk+1 \u2229 . . . \u2229Ul . Fix an increasing computable sequence \u03b5 < \u03b51 <\n\u03b52 < . . . < \u03b5 \u2032 . There exists some k1 such that for every i > k1 the set\nU1..k1 \u222aUi\nhas measure at most \u03b51 . (Indeed, if for some i the measure is greater than \u03b51 , then, adding Ui\nas a new term in the intersection, we decrease the measure of the intersection at least by \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b5 ;\nsuch a decrease may happen only finitely many times.) For similar reasons we can then find k2\nsuch that for every i the set\nU1..k1 \u222aUk1 +1..k2 \u222aUi\nhas measure at most \u03b52 for every i > k2 . And so on. This construction is 0\u2032 -computable and the\nunion\nU1..k1 \u222aUk1 +1..k2 \u222aUk2 +1..k3 \u222a . . .\n7\n\n\fis an 0\u2032 -effectively open cover of lim infUn of measure at most \u03b5 \u2032 .\n\n4 Kolmogorov and 2-randomness\nTheorem 6 has an historically remarkable corollary. When Kolmogorov tried to define randomness in 1960s, he started with the following approach. A string x of length n is \"random\" if\nits complexity C(x) (or conditional complexity C(x|n); in fact, these requirements are almost\nequivalent) is close to n: the randomness deficiency d(x) of x is defined as\nd(x) = |x| \u2212C(x)\n(here |x| stands for the length of x). This sounds reasonable, but if we then define an infinite\nrandom sequence as a sequence whose prefixes have deficiencies bounded by a constant, such\na sequence does not exist at all: Martin-L\u00f6f showed that every infinite sequence has prefixes of\narbitrarily large deficiency, and suggested a different definition of randomness using effectively\nnull sets. Later more refined versions of randomness deficiency (using monotone or prefix\ncomplexity) appeared that make the criterion of randomness in terms of deficiencies possible.\nBut before that, in 1968, Kolmogorov wrote:\nThe most natural definition of infinite Bernoulli sequence is the following: x is\nconsidered m-Bernoulli type if m is such that all [its i-bit prefixes] xi are initial\nsegments of the finite m-Bernoulli sequences. Martin-L\u00f6f gives another, possibly\nnarrower definition [5, p. 663].\nHere Kolmogorov\u0001 speaks about \"m-Bernoulli\" finite sequence x (this means that C(x|n, k)\nis greater than log nk \u2212 m where n is the length of x and k is the number of ones in x). We\nrestrict ourselves to the case of uniform Bernoulli measure where p = q = 1/2. In this case\nKolmogorov's idea can be described as follows: an infinite sequence is random if each its prefix\nalso appears as a prefix of some random string (=string with small randomness deficiency).\nMore formal, let us define\n \u0304 = inf{d(y) | x is a prefix of y}\nd(x)\n \u0304\nand require that d(x)\nis bounded for all prefixes of an infinite sequence \u03c9 . It is shown by\nMiller [7] that this definition is equivalent to Martin-L\u00f6f randomness relativized to 0\u2032 (called\nalso 2-randomness):\n \u0304\nTheorem 7 (Miller) A sequence \u03c9 is Martin-L\u00f6f 0\u2032 -random if and only if the quantities d(x)\nfor all prefixes x of \u03c9 are bounded from above by a common constant.\nThere is another related result proved in Miller [7] and Nies et al. [9]:\nTheorem 8 (Miller, Nies, Stephan, Terwijn) A sequence \u03c9 is Martin-L\u00f6f 0\u2032 -random if and\nonly if\nC(\u03c90 \u03c91 . . . \u03c9n\u22121 ) > n \u2212 c\nfor some c and for infinitely many n.\n\n8\n\n\fIn the latter criterion the condition looks stronger: if C(\u03c90 \u03c91 . . . \u03c9n\u22121 ) > n \u2212 c for infinitely\nmany n, then evidently d \u0304 for all prefixes of \u03c9 is bounded by c. Theorem 8 can be reformulated\nas follows: the sequence \u03c9 is not 0\u2032 -random if and only if n \u2212C(\u03c90 . . . \u03c9n\u22121 ) \u2192 \u221e as n \u2192 \u221e.\nLet us show why theorems 7 and 8 are consequences of Theorem 6. In each direction we\nconsider the stronger statement (among the two versions provided by theorems 7 and 8).\nProof. Assume that n \u2212C(\u03c90 . . . \u03c9n\u22121 ) \u2192 \u221e for some sequence \u03c9 . We need to construct a\n0\u2032 -effectively open set of small measure that contains \u03c9 (together with all other sequences with\nthe same property).\nFix some c. For each n consider the set Dcn of all strings u of length n such that C(u) < n \u2212 c\n(i.e., strings u of length n such that d(u) > c). It has at most 2n\u2212c elements. Then consider the\nset\n[\n[u]\nUnc =\nu\u2208Dcn\n\n(= the set of all sequences that have prefixes in Dcn ). The set Unc is effectively open uniformly\nin (n, c), since Dcn is enumerable uniformly in (n, c). Moreover, there are at most 2n\u2212c strings\nin Dcm , hence the measure of Unc is at most 2\u2212c . The we can apply Theorem 6 to get an 0\u2032 effectively open set of small measure (say, 2\u2212(c\u22121) ) that covers lim infn Unc. All the sequences\nthat we need to cover belong to this lim inf by definition. This proves the forward direction of\nthe equivalence. (Remark: if we wanted to prove only the weaker statement from Theorem 7,\nthe weaker version of Theorem 6, with Int(VN ), would be enough.)\nConsider now the reverse implication; we give the proof in terms of Martin-L\u00f6f tests.\n(Miller [7] provided a proof solely in terms of Kolmogorov complexity.) Assume that a sequence \u03c9 is covered (for each c) by a 0\u2032 -computable sequence of intervals I0 , I1 , . . . of total\nmeasure at most 2\u2212c . (We omit c in our notation, but the construction below depends on c.)\nUsing the approximations 0n of 0\u2032 (obtained by performing at most n steps of computation\nfor each n) we get another (now computable) family of intervals I0,n , I1,n , . . . such that Ii,n = Ii\nfor every i and sufficiently large n. We may assume without loss of generality that Ii,n either has\nsize at least 2\u2212n (i.e., is determined by a string of length at most n) or equals \u22a5 (a special value\nthat denotes the empty set) since only the limit behavior is prescribed. Moreover, we may also\nassume that Ii,n = \u22a5 for n < i and that the total measure of all I0,n , I1,n , . . . does not exceed 2\u2212c\nfor every n (the latter is achieved by deleting the excessive intervals in this sequence starting\nfrom the beginning; the stabilization guarantees that all limit intervals will be eventually let\nthrough).\nSince Ii,n is defined by intervals of size at least 2\u2212n , we get at most 2n\u2212c strings of length\nn covered by intervals Ii,n for any given n and all i. This set of strings is decidable (recall that\nonly i not exceeding n are used), therefore each string in this set can be determined, assuming\nc is known, by a string of length n \u2212 c, the binary representation of its ordinal number in this\nset. Note that this string also determines n if c is known.\nReturning to the sequence \u03c9 , we note that it is covered by some Ii and therefore is covered\nby Ii,n for this i and all sufficiently large n (after the value of Ii,n is stabilized), say, for all n > N.\nLet u be the prefix of \u03c9 of length N. All extensions of u of any length n are covered by Ii,n and\nthus have complexity less than n \u2212 c + O(1), conditional to c, hence their complexity is at most\n \u0304 > c \u2212 2 log c \u2212 O(1).\nn \u2212 c + 2 log c + O(1). This means that d(u)\n \u0304\nSuch a string u can be found for every c, therefore \u03c9 has prefixes of arbitrarily large ddeficiency. This implies, in particular, that n \u2212C(\u03c90 . . . \u03c9n\u22121 ) \u2192 \u221e. \u0003\n\n9\n\n\f5 A generalization that is not possible\nThe assumption of Theorem 6 was that all Ui have small measures: \u03bc (Ui ) 6 \u03b5 for every i. In the\nclassical measure-theoretic result one can replace this condition by a weaker one and require\nthat infinitely many Ui have small measure; it does not matter since we can delete all other Ui .\nFormally, one can note that\n\u03bc (lim inf Ui ) 6 lim inf \u03bc (Ui ).\ni\n\ni\n\nAs Conidis has shown, for the effective version of the statement the situation is different\n(and this is understandable, since we do not know which Ui have small measure).\nTheorem 9 (Conidis) Theorem 6 is no more true if we require only that infinitely many Ui have\nmeasure at most \u03b5 .\nProof. Recall Martin-L\u00f6f's definition of randomness. The first level of an universal test is\nan effectively open set that covers all non-random reals (sequences) and has measure at most\n1/2. The complement of this set is an effectively closed set, and its minimal element is a lower\nsemicomputable random number; we call it \u03a9 (since it is closely related to Chaitin's Omega\nnumber).\nThis consitruction can be relativized with oracle 0\u2032 : then we get a 0\u2032 -effectively open set of\n\u2032\nmeasure at most 1/2 and \u03a90 , the minimal real outside it. This number is 0\u2032 -lower semicomputable, and it is easy to see that it can be represented as\n\u2032\n\n\u03a90 = lim infwi ,\nwhere wi is a computable sequence. Now we show that for every rational \u03b5 > 0 one can effectively construct a computable sequence of effectively open sets Ui,\u03b5 such that\nlim inf \u03bc (Ui,\u03b5 ) 6 \u03b5\ni\n\n\u2032\n\nand \u03a90 \u2208 lim inf Ui .\ni\n\nIf the strong version of Theorem 6 were true, we could conclude that \u03a9 is not 0\u2032 -random, which\nis not the case.\nIt remains to construct the set Ui . One can let Ui = (inf j>i w j \u2212 \u03b5 /3, wi + \u03b5 /3). \u0003\nRemark. This example shows only that an effective transformation in Theorem 6 is not\npossible. However, Conidis (with a much more ingenious construction) has shown that there\nexists one specific computable sequence Ui of effectively open sets such that lim infi \u03bc (Ui ) 6\n1/2 but lim infi Ui cannot be covered by an 0\u2032 -effectively open set of a measure 3/4.\n\n6 Effective Fatou's lemma\nThe results discussed above may Rbe considered as constructive versions of classical Fatou's\nlemma. This lemma says that if fi (x) d \u03bc (x) 6 \u03b5 for \u03bc -measurable functions f0 , f1 , f2 , . . .,\nthen\nZ\nlim inf fi (x) d \u03bc (x) 6 \u03b5 .\ni\u2192+\u221e\n\nIts constructive version can be formulated as follows:\n10\n\n\fTheorem\n10 Let fi be a computable sequence of lower semicomputable functions such that\nR\nfi (x) d \u03bc (x) does not exceed some rational \u03b5 for all i. Then for every \u03b5 \u2032 > \u03b5 one can effectively\nconstruct a lower 0\u2032 -semicomputable function \u03c6 such that\nlim inf fn (x) 6 \u03c6 (x) for every x, and\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6 (x)d \u03bc (x) 6 \u03b5 \u2032 .\n\nThis is a natural generalization of the statement of Theorem 6 (which considers the special case\nwhen functions are indicator functions of open sets) and may be proved by essentially the same\nargument.\nTo make the statement precise, we need to say on which space all fi are defined. We do\nnot try to formulate this statement in full generality and note only that we can consider Cantor\nspace, the discrete space N or reals (and the same proof works).\nProof. For all integers m, for all positive rational numbers r, and and for each open interval\nU we consider an auxiliary function u = r \u03c7U (which is equal to r inside U and is equal to 0\nelsewhere), and try to increase all fm , fm+1 , . . . up to u:\nfs := max( fs , u)\n(for s = m, m + 1, m + 2, . . .) in the hope that the integral of fs still does not exceed the (increased) threshold. Note that the function u is lower semicomputable, the maximum of two\nlower semicomputable functions is lower semicomputable, and therefore crossing the threshold is an enumerable event that can be checked using 0\u2032 . If we encounter some s where this\nintegral exceeds the threshold, we trim u:\nu := min(u, fs )\nand start over, increasing all fm , fm+1 , . . . up to (new) u. Now we can make at least one step\nmore, since the function that created troubles is now used as a cap and for this s the integral\ndoes not exceed even the old threshold. But we may get again into troubles on some later stage\ns\u2032 > s. In this case we use fs\u2032 as the cap, too:\nu := min(u, fs\u2032 ).\nAnd so on. Note that the overflow can happen only finitely many times (for the same reasons\nas before: after each trimming the integral of u decreases at most by \u03b5 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b5 , the increase of the\nthreshold). So finally we get a lower semicomputable function whose integral does not exceed\nthe increased threshold, and proceed to the next triple (m, r,U ).\nThe 0\u2032 -lower semicomputable function \u03c6 that we need to construct can be defined now as\nthe supremum of all the functions u constructed on all steps. The integral of this function cannot\nbe large, since for any finite set of u-functions the supremum of them (even together with one\nof fi ) was below the threshold.\nIf lim infi fi (x) > r for some r, then fi (x) > r for all i starting from some N. Take some\ninterval U that contains x, and start adding r \u03c7U to fN , fN+1 , . . .. Since fi (x) > r for i > N, the\ntrimming will not change the value of u(x), so after this step the value at x exceeds r. \u0003\nIn this way we can also get the results of Sections 1 and 2 as corollaries.\nAcknowledgments.
