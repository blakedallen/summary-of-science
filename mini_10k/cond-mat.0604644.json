Shklovskii\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0604644v2 [cond-mat.dis-nn] 1 May 2006\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Minnesota\n116 Church Street SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455\n(Dated: September 29, 2018)\nWe study the hopping conduction in a composite made of straight metallic nanowires randomly\nand isotropically suspended in an insulator. Uncontrolled donors and acceptors in the insulator lead\nto random charging of wires and, hence, to a finite bare density of states at the Fermi level. Then\nthe Coulomb interactions between electrons of distant wires result in the soft Coulomb gap. At low\ntemperatures the conductivity is due to variable range hopping of electrons between wires and obeys\nthe Efros-Shklovskii (ES) law ln \u03c3 \u221d \u2212(TES /T )1/2 . We show that TES \u221d 1/(nL3 )2 , where n is the\nconcentration of wires and L is the wire length. Due to enhanced screening of Coulomb potentials,\nat large enough nL3 the ES law is replaced by the Mott law.\n\nIn recent years, electron transport in composites made\nof metallic granules surrounded by some kind of insulator generated a lot of interest in both fundamental and\napplied research. Conductivities of the composites with\nspherical or generally speaking single scale granules are\nwell studied (see review [1] and references therein). If the\nnumber of granules n per unit volume is large, granules\ntouch each other and the conductivity is metallic. When\nn is smaller than the percolation threshold nc , granules\nare isolated from each other, the composite is on the insulating side of metal-insulator transition and the conductivity is due to hopping. It was observed that in this\ncase, the temperature dependence of the conductivity \u03c3\nobeys\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 exp[\u2212(T0 /T )\u03b1 ],\n\n(1)\n\nwhere T0 is a characteristic temperature and \u03b1 = 1/2.\nThis behavior of conductivity \u03c3 was interpreted as the\nEfros-Shklovskii (ES) variable range hopping (VRH) between granules [1, 2]. The finite bare density of states\nat the Fermi level was attributed to the charged impurities in the insulator playing the role of randomly biased\ngates. Then the interaction of electrons residing on different dots creates the Coulomb gap, which leads to ES\nvariable range hopping.\nFor needle-like granules such as metallic whiskers or\nmetallic nanotubes, the experimental situation is more\ncomplicated than for single scale ones. Recently ES temperature dependence of the conductivity was reported [3]\nfor composites made of bundles of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNT) suspended in insulating polymers. On\nthe other hand, the Mott law with \u03b1 = 1/4 was also observed in many nanotube based materials [3, 4, 5, 6]. In\norder to understand the puzzling crossover between ES\nand Mott hopping, in this paper, we study the low temperature ohmic dc transport in an isotropic suspension of\nelongated metallic granules in an insulating medium (see\nFig. 1). Below we call such a granule a wire for brevity.\nIn this paper we restrict ourselves to scaling approximation for the conductivity and to delineating the corresponding scaling regimes. In our scaling theory, we drop\n\nd\n\nL\n\nFIG. 1: A suspension of neutral metallic wires in an insulator\nwith concentration 1/L3 \u226a n \u226a 1/L2 d.\n\naway both all numerical factors and, moreover, also all\nthe logarithmic factors, which do exist in this problem,\nbecause it deals with strongly elongated cylinders. In\nthis context, we will use symbol \"=\" to mean \"equal up\nto a numerical coefficient or a logarithmic factor\".\nWe assume each wire is a cylinder with the length L\nand the diameter d \u226a L. When the concentration of\nwires n is very small, the distance between them is much\nlarger than L, we can easily apply the results obtained in\nthe Ref. [2]. Here we consider a range of concentrations\n1/L3 \u226a n \u226a 1/L2 d, where n is so large that spheres\nbuilt on each wire as the diameter strongly overlap, but\nthe system is still far below the percolation threshold\nnc = 1/L2 d. Percolation threshold at very small concentration nc = 1/L2 d is the result of large excluding\nvolume L2 d which one wire creates for centers of others.\n(At concentrations above 1/L2 d it also becomes impossible to place wires randomly and isotropically because\nof nematic ordering [7], but there is no such problem at\nn \u226a nc ). Our results are summarized in Fig. 2 in the\nplane of parameters T and nL3 . The main result is that\nat low temperatures, we arrive at ES law\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 exp[\u2212(TES /T )1/2 ]\n\n(2)\n\nwith\nTES =\n\ne2\n,\n\u03baa(nL3 )2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03ba is the dielectric constant and a is the tunneling\n\n\f2\ndecay length in the insulator. The large factor (nL3 )2\nin Eq. (3) is a result of the enhancement of both the\neffective dielectric constant and the localization length\nin the composite. At large enough nL3 and higher temperatures, ES law is replaced by the Mott law. And\nwhen the temperatures are sufficiently high, both VRH\nregimes are replaced by the activated nearest neighboring\nhopping (NNH) regimes.\nLet us start from the dielectric constant of the composite. In the range of concentrations 1/L3 \u226a n \u226a 1/L2 d,\nits macroscopic dielectric constant \u03baeff is greatly enhanced due to polarization of long metallic wires. It was\nshown in the Ref [8, 9], that\n\u03baeff = (nL3 )\u03ba.\n\n(4)\n\nSuch result can be understood in the following way. If\nthe wave vector q is larger than 1/L, the static dielectric\nfunction for the wire suspension has the metal-like form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(5)\n\u01eb(q) = \u03ba 1 + 2 2 ,\nq rs\nwhere rs = (nL)\u22121/2 is the typical separation of the\nwire from other wires. It plays the role of screening radius for the wire charge. The function \u01eb(q) grows with\ndecreasing q until q = 1/L where the composite loses\nits metallic response and \u01eb(q) saturates. As a result,\nthe macroscopic effective dielectric constant is given by\n\u03baeff = \u01eb(q = 1/L) = nL3 \u03ba. Within our scaling approximation, one can also derive Eq. (4) starting from the\nfacts that each isolated wire has polarizability equal to\nL3 and due to random positions of wires the acting electric field does not differ from the average one.\nThe spacing between charging energy levels of such\nwire is the order of Ec = e2 /\u03baeff L = e2 /\u03banL4 . If the wire\nis thick enough, it can be treated as a three dimensional\nobject and the mean quantum level spacing \u03b4 in the wire\nis the order of \u03bbF h\u03042 /mLd2 , where \u03bbF is the Fermi wavelength and m is the effective electron mass. Narrow wires\nsuch as SWNT with single conducting channel will be discussed later. Using the tunneling decay length a in the\ninsulator, we can rewrite \u03b4 in the form \u03b4 = \u03b2e2 a2 /\u03bad2 L\nwhere \u03b2 = \u03bbF /a. The ratio Ec /\u03b4 decreases proportional\nto 1/nL3 because of enhanced screening of Coulomb interaction in the denser system of longer wires.\nWe start our discussion with relatively small nL3 such\nthat nL3 < d2 /\u03b2a2 and Ec \u226b \u03b4. The density of states\nand localization length are all the information we need to\ncalculate the VRH conductivity. In contrary to a doped\nsemiconductor, in a suspension of neutral wires, the bare\ndensity of states at the Fermi level g0 = 0. Charging\nenergy levels of the suspended wires are shown in Fig.\n3(a), they are equally spaced by Ec . The Fermi level is\nat zero energy between empty and filled levels.\nSince the ground states of wires determine the low temperature hopping transport, we consider only the ground\n\nT\n\nN2\n\nN1\n2\n2\n\nM\nES\n\nnL3\n\n0\n\nd2\n\n1\n\n2\n\nL/d\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The summary of the transport regimes\nfor relatively clean wires schematically plotted in the plane\nof nL3 and temperature T . The dark line separates regimes\nwhere Coulomb interaction is important (N1 [Eq. (7)] and ES\nlaw [Eq. (2)]) from regimes where it plays a minor role (N2\n[(10)] and Mott (M) law [Eq. 8]). The grey (blue) line separates activated the nearest neighbor hopping (NNH) regimes\nfrom the VRH regimes. Shaded domain represents the metallic side of the insulator-metal transition. Instead of smooth\ncrossovers at dark and grey lines, in the vicinity of this transition, the conductivity has a critical behavior.\n\nEc\n2\n\nEc\n2\n\n(a)\n\ng0\n\ng0\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 3: The density of ground states at Ec \u226b \u03b4.

Occupied states are shaded.\n\nstate in each wire at a given number of electrons and\nexclude excited states [2]. Thus, the density of states\nwe need can be called bare density of ground states\n(BDOGS). According to Ref. [2], the finite BDOGS near\nthe Fermi level originates from uncontrollable donors (or\nacceptors) in the insulating host. Donors have the electron energy above the Fermi energy of wires. Therefore,\nthey donate electrons to wires. A positively charged ionized donor can attract and effectively bind fractional negative charges on all neighboring wires, leaving the rest of\neach wire fractionally charged. At a large enough average number (\u226b 1) of donors per wire, effective fractional\ncharges on different wires are uniformly distributed from\n\u2212e/2 to e/2. In such a way the Coulomb blockade in a\nsingle wire is lifted and the discrete BDOGS get smeared\n(see Fig. 3(b)). The BDOGS g0 becomes 1/Ec L3 . In\nthe very vicinity of the Fermi energy, the long range\nCoulomb interaction creates the parabolic Coulomb gap\n\n\f3\n\u2206 (see Fig. 3(c)). The Coulomb gap affects energy interval |\u01eb| <\n\u223c \u2206. At low enough T , when the range of\nenergy levels around the Fermi level responsible for hopping (TES T )1/2 is much smaller than \u2206, the conductivity\nobeys the ES law (see Eq. (2)) and does not depend on\ng0 [10]. The parameter TES = e2 /\u03baeff \u03be, where \u03be is the\nlocalization length for tunneling to distances much larger\nthan L. Let us concentrate now on the nontrivial value\nof the localization length \u03be.\nIt was suggested [11] that such long range hopping process can be realized by tunneling through a sequence\nof wires (see Fig. 4). The states of the intermediate wires participate in the tunneling process as virtual\nstates. Nowadays the virtual electron tunneling through\na single granule is called co-tunneling [1, 12, 13, 14, 15]\nand regarded as a key mechanism of low temperature\ncharge transport via quantum dots. One should distinguish the two co-tunneling mechanisms, elastic and inelastic. During the process of elastic co-tunneling, the\nelectron tunneling through an intermediate virtual state\nin the granule leaves the granule with the same energy as\nits initial state. On the contrary, the tunneling electron\nin the inelastic co-tunneling mechanism leaves the granule with an excited electron-hole pair behind it. Which\nmechanism dominates the transport depends on the\u221atemperature. Inelastic co-tunneling dominates at T > Ec \u03b4,\nwhile below this temperature, elastic co-tunneling wins.\nIn discussions below, we consider sufficiently low temperatures such that only elastic co-tunneling is involved.\nFirst we remind the idea of calculation of the localization length \u03be used in Ref. [11]. (Such approach was also\napplied in the papers [2, 16]). When an electron tunnels\nthrough the insulator between wires at the nearest neighboring hopping (NNH) distance r, it accumulates dimensionless action r/a, where a is the tunneling decay length\nin the insulator. We want to emphasize that the NNH\ndistance r is realized only in one point of the wire and,\ntherefore, is much shorter than the typical separation\nalong the wire from other wires rs . NNH distance r can\nbe calculated using the percolation method [10]. If one\nbuilds around each wire a cylinder with length L and radius r, percolation through these cylinders appears, when\nnL2 r = 1. This happens because excluded volume created by one cylinder is not r2 L, but L2 r. As a result,\nwe obtain r = 1/nL2 . We assume the metallic wire is\nonly weakly disordered and hence we neglect the decay\nof electron wave function in the wire. (This assumption\nwill be relaxed later.) Over distance x, electron accumulates x/L additive actions of the order of r/a. Thus,\nits wave function decays as exp(\u2212xr/La) = exp(\u2212x/\u03be),\nwhere the localization length \u03be = aL/r = a(nL3 ). This\ncontributes another factor nL3 to Eq. (3). Eq. (2) with\nTES given by Eq. (3) is valid in the left lower corner of\nFig. 2 labeled as ES. More rigorous calculation [15] of the\nlocalization length \u03be gives \u03be = L/[ln(Ec \u03c0/\u03b4) + 1/nL2a].\nOur simple derivation of \u03be along the line of Ref.

We argue that in\nour case 1/nL2a \u226b d/a, and d/a can be quite large. As\na result, within a large range of the ratio Ec /\u03b4, the term\nln(Ec \u03c0\u03b4) is only a small correction to the leading term\n1/nL2a.\nAt high temperatures, the conductivity is dominated\nby the nearest neighbor hopping.

Eventually, the Coulomb gap becomes\nnarrower than the width of Mott's optimal band \u01ebM =\nT 3/4 /(g0 \u03be 3 )1/4 at given T . At this point, the ES law is\nreplaced by the conventional Mott's law,\n\u03c3 = \u03c30 exp[\u2212(TM /T )1/4 ],\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b2e2\n1\n=\n.\n3\ng0 \u03be\n\u03baan3 L7 d2\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nTM =\n\nThis regime is labeled as M in Fig. 2.

This change of the temperature\ndependence of the conductivity from 1/2 ES law to 1/4\nMott law was observed at relatively high temperatures\nand large concentrations in the experiment [3].\nAt high temperatures, the Mott's law is replaced by\nthe NNH conductivity with activation energy equal to\nthe spacing of quantum levels \u03b4.

Dark line separates\nregimes where Coulomb interaction is important (N1,3 and ES\nlaws) from regimes where it plays minor role (N2,4 and Mott\nlaws). The grey (blue) line separates activated NNH regimes\nfrom VRH regimes. The left dashed line marks the border\nwhere dielectric constant \u03baeff starts growing with nL3 , while\nthe right dashed line serves as the border where localization\nlength \u03be stops growing and becomes \u03bb. The shaded domain\nrepresents the metallic side of the insulator-metal transition.\nInstead of smooth crossover, in the vicinity of the transition,\nthe conductivity has a critical behavior.\n\nWe call this regime N2 and show it in the right upper corner of Fig. 2. It is easy to check that ES and Mott VRH\ntransport regimes match corresponding NNH regimes N1\nand N2 smoothly, when VRH distance is of the order of\nthe wire length L. This happens at the gray line of Fig.\n2. The Coulomb regimes ES and N1 smoothly crossover\nto the regimes M and N2 of noninteracting electrons at\nthe dark line of Fig. 2. We stop at nL3 = L/d, where\npercolation leads to the insulator-metal transition. Our\nscaling approach is not designed to study the critical behavior of the conductivity in the vicinity of the transition.\nNow we switch to the case of metallic wires with a\nstrong internal disorder, where the electron wave function decay length \u03bb is much smaller than the wire length\nL. The summary of transport regimes for this case is\npresented in Fig. 5. In order to show all the possible\nregimes, we assume that \u03bb is small enough for the order\nof labels on the nL3 axis shown in Fig. 5. (At a larger \u03bb\nonly some of the shown regimes may exist.) We also plotted regimes labeled as ES and N1 on the left of the border\nline nL3 = n\u03bb3 . The characteristic energies of electron\ntransport in these regimes are given by Eqs. (3) and (7)\nrespectively. When L \u226b \u03bb, the wires can be treated as a\nlarger number of clean metallic wires with length of the\norder \u03bb and the concentration nL/\u03bb. Following the logic\nof Ref. [8] and our derivation of \u03baeff (Eq. (4)) one can\nshow that the effective macroscopic dielectric constant is\ngiven by\n\u03baeff1 = \u03banL\u03bb2 .\n\n(11)\n\nComparing to (Eq. (4)) we see that the dielectric constant \u03baeff1 is strongly reduced by the internal disorder\nof wires. This happens because the disorder effectively\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the first term on the right hand side accounts for\nthe decay of the wave function in the wire, while the second term represents the decay in the insulating medium\nbetween the wires. When nL3 < \u03bb/a, the second term\ndominates, \u03be = nL3 a, which is the same as what we got\nfor the case of clean wire. However, because of new dielectric constant \u03baeff1 (Eq. 11), we obtain new regime\nlabeled ES1 in the Fig. 5. Here the conductivity obeys\nES law with the characteristic temperature\nTES1 =\n\ne2\n.\n\u03baan2 L4 \u03bb2\n\n(13)\n\nThe charging energy Ec also changes to e2 /\u03baeff1 L =\ne2 /\u03banL2 \u03bb2 . It decreases with growing nL3 and reaches\nthe mean quantum level spacing \u03b4 of the wire at nL3 =\nd2 L2 /\u03b2a2 \u03bb2 . With relatively high temperature and small\nnL3 < d2 L2 /\u03b2a2 \u03bb2 , the regime ES1 crossover to the\nregime N3 , where the conductivity can be represented\nby the same equation (6) but with a different activation\nenergy EA = e2 /\u03banL2 \u03bb2 . When nL3 > d2 L2 /\u03b2a2 \u03bb2 , the\nCoulomb interaction plays a minor role. Hopping conductivities in regimes M and N2 are not affected by the\nchange of the dielectric constant and are given by the\nsame Eqs. (8), (9) and (6), (10) respectively.\nAt even larger nL3 > \u03bb/a, the decay of electron wave\nfunctions in the wire dominates, thus \u03be = \u03bb. As a result,\nwe have another ES regime, ES2 , with\ne2\n,\n\u03banL\u03bb3\n\n(14)\n\ne2\n.\n\u03baan2 L4 \u03bb2\n\n(15)\n\nTES2 =\nthe Mott regime M1 with\nTM1 =\n\nand the activated nearest neighboring hopping regime\nN4 , with the activation energy \u03b4 and\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\ne2 \u03b2a2\nL\nexp \u2212 2\n.\n(16)\n\u03c3 \u221d exp \u2212\n\u03bb\n\u03bad LT\nThus, we have completed our consideration of the\nphase diagram up to nL3 = L/d, at which wires begin to\npercolate. What happens to the conductivity if one manages to create an isotropic suspension with nL3 > L/d?\nIn contrary to relatively clean wires, there is no insulatormetal transition around nL3 = L/d, where wires start to\ntouch each other. Indeed such transition happens when\n\n\f5\nthe typical branch of the percolating network is metallic,\nwhich means the typical distance between two nearest\nneighboring contacts along the same wire can not be L,\nbut should be smaller than \u03bb. We can now think about\npercolation over pieces of wires with the length \u03bb and\nthe effective concentration nL/\u03bb. Such percolation appears at (nL/\u03bb)(\u03bb2 d) = 1 or nL3 = L2 /\u03bbd. This is the\nthreshold of insulator-metal transition. As a result our\nphase diagram of hopping regimes is extended as far as\nnL3 = L2 /\u03bbd.\nIn this paper we concentrated on relatively thick wires\nwith the three dimensional density of states. Narrow\nwires with as few as one conducting channel should\nbe treated as one dimensional objects. In such case\nthe level spacing is given by \u03b4 = h\u03042 /m\u03bbF L and thus\nEc /\u03b4 = (1/nL3 )(\u03bbF /a) = \u03b2/nL3 . Since most probably\n\u03b2 is the order of 1, while nL3 \u226b 1, the charging energy\nEc is always smaller than level spacing \u03b4. Coulomb interaction plays minor role in such system. Therefore the\nleft part of our phase diagram Fig. 2 including ES regime\nvanishes.\nIt is tempting to apply this theory to carbon nanotubes. Metallic SWNT has only one conducting channel. Therefore for them, the domain of ES hoping most\nlikely vanishes. Bundles of SWNT, studied in Ref. [3] definitely have many channels and our theory should work\nfor them providing the geometry of bundles may be approximated by a set of randomly oriented rigid rods of\na given characteristic length L. In this case, the range\nof ES conductivity should exist. ES range may also exist for multi-wall nanotubes, where one can expect many\nparallel metallic channels.\nIn this paper, we considered only straight wires. One\ncan generalize this theory to random system of flexible wires formed by interpenetrating Gaussian coils (for\n\nexample conducting polymers suspended in insulating\nmedium). This theory will be published elsewhere.\nWe are grateful to M. Fogler, M. Foygel, Y.M. Galperin\nand A.V. Lopatin for useful discussions.\n\n[1] I.S. Beloborodov, A.V. Loptain, V.M.
