This note presents an alternative characterization using a channel enhancement argument. This characterization relies on an extremal\nentropy inequality recently proved in the context of multi-antenna broadcast channels, and is\ndirectly built on the physical intuition regarding to the optimal transmission strategy in this\ncommunication scenario.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConsider a multi-antenna wiretap channel with nt transmit antennas and nr and ne receive antennas\nat the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, respectively:\nyr [m] = Hr x[m] + wr [m]\nye [m] = He x[m] + we [m]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Hr \u2208 Rnr \u00d7nt and He \u2208 Rne \u00d7nt are the channel matrices associated with the legitimate receiver\nand the eavesdropper. The channel matrices Hr and He are assumed to be fixed during the entire\ntransmission and are known to all three terminals. The additive noise wr [m] and we [m] are white\nGaussian vectors with zero mean and are independent across the time index m. The channel input\nsatisfies a total power constraint\nn\n1X\nkx[m]k2 \u2264 P.\n(2)\nn m=1\n1\n\n\fThe secrecy capacity is defined as the maximum rate of communication such that the information\ncan be decoded arbitrarily reliably at the legitimate receiver but not at the eavesdropper.\nFor a discrete memoryless wiretap channel P (Yr , Ye |X), a single-letter expression for the secrecy\ncapacity was obtained by Csisz\u00e1r and K\u00f6rner [2] and can be written as\nC = max [I(U; Yr ) \u2212 I(U; Ye )]\n\n(3)\n\nP (U,X)\n\nwhere U is an auxiliary random variable over a certain alphabet that satisfies the Markov relation\nU \u2212 X \u2212 (Yr , Ye ). Moreover, (3) extends to continuous alphabet cases with power constraint, so\nthe problem of characterizing the secrecy capacity of the multi-antenna wiretap channel reduces to\nevaluating (3) for the specific channel model (1) .\nNote that evaluating (3) involves solving a functional, nonconvex optimization problem. Solving\noptimization problems of this type usually requires nontrivial techniques and strong inequalities.\nIndeed, for the single-antenna case (nt = nr = ne = 1), the capacity expression (3) was successfully\nevaluated by Leung and Hellman [3] using a result of Wyner [4] on the degraded wiretap channel\nand the celebrated entropy-power inequality [5, Cha. 16.7]. (Alternatively, it can also be evaluated\nusing a classical result from estimation theory via a relationship between mutual information and\nminimum mean-squared error estimation [6].) Unfortunately, the same approach does not extend\nto the multi-antenna case, as the latter, in its general form, belongs to the class of nondegraded\nwiretap channels. The problem of characterizing the secrecy capacity of the multi-antenna wiretap\nchannel remained open until the recent work of Khisti and Wornell [1].\nIn [1], Khisti and Wornell followed an indirect approach to evaluate the capacity expression (3)\nfor the multi-antenna wiretap channel. Key to their evaluation is the following genie-aided upper\nbound\nI(U; Yr ) \u2212 I(U; Ye ) \u2264\n=\n\u2264\n=\n\nI(U; Yr , Ye ) \u2212 I(U; Ye )\nI(X; Yr , Ye ) \u2212 I(X; Ye ) \u2212 [I(X; Yr , Ye |U) \u2212 I(X; Ye |U)]\nI(X; Yr , Ye ) \u2212 I(X; Ye )\nI(X; Yr |Ye )\n\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nwhere (5) follows from the Markov chain U \u2212 X \u2212 (Yr , Ye ), and (6) follows from the trivial inequality\nI(X; Yr , Ye |U) \u2265 I(X; Ye |U). Khisti and Wornell [1] further noticed that the original objective of\noptimization I(U; Yr ) \u2212 I(U; Ye ) depends on the channel transition probability P (Yr , Ye |X) only\nthrough the marginals P (Yr |X) and P (Ye |X), whereas the upper bound I(X; Yr |Ye ) does depend\non the joint conditional P (Yr , Ye |X). A good upper bound on the secrecy capacity is thus contrived\nas\nC = max [I(U; Yr ) \u2212 I(U; Ye )] \u2264\nP (U,X)\n\nmin\n\nmax I(X; Yr\u2032 |Ye\u2032 ) = max\n\nP (Yr\u2032 ,Ye\u2032 |X)\u2208D P (X)\n\n2\n\nmin\n\nP (X) P (Yr\u2032 ,Ye\u2032 |X)\u2208D\n\nI(X; Yr\u2032 |Ye\u2032 ) (8)\n\n\fwhere D is a set of joint conditionals P (Yr\u2032 , Ye\u2032 |X) satisfying\nP (Yr\u2032 |X) = P (Yr |X) and P (Ye\u2032 |X) = P (Ye |X).\n\n(9)\n\nThe upper bound minP (Yr\u2032 ,Ye\u2032 |X)\u2208D maxP (X) I(X; Yr\u2032 |Ye\u2032 ) has a specific physical meaning: it is the\nsecrecy capacity of the wiretap channel P (Yr\u2032 , Ye\u2032 |X) where the legitimate user has access to both Yr\nand Ye , minimized over the worst cooperation between the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper.\nIn essence, this is very similar to the Sato upper bound on the sum capacity of a general broadcast channel [7]. For the multi-antenna wiretap channel, Khisti and Wornell [1] showed that the\nconditional mutual information I(X; Yr\u2032 |Ye\u2032 ) is maximized when the channel input X is Gaussian.\nHence, the upper bounds in (8) can be written as a saddle-point matrix optimization problem.\nBy comparing the value of the optimal Gaussian solution for the original optimization problem\nmaxP (U,X) [I(U; Yr ) \u2212 I(U; Ye )] with the upper bounds in (8), Khisti and Wornell [1] showed that\nthe results are identical and thus established the optimality of both matrix characterizations for\nthe multi-antenna wiretap channel. Operationally, Khisti and Wornell [1] showed that the original multi-antenna wiretap channel has the same secrecy capacity as when the legitimate user has\naccess to both received signals and optimized over the worst cooperation between the legitimate\nuser and the eavesdropper. (The same approach was also followed by Shafiee et al. [8] and Oggier\nand Hassibi [9] to characterize the secrecy capacity of the 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 and the general multi-antenna\nwiretap channel, respectively.) Considering the disparity between these two physical scenarios, this\nis a rather surprising result.\nThe approach of Khisti and Wornell [1] also reminds us of the degraded same marginals bound\nfor the capacity region of the multi-antenna broadcast channel [10, 11]. There, the optimality of the\nGaussian input is hard to come by, and a precise characterization of the capacity region had to wait\nuntil the proposal of a drastically different approach by Weingarten et al. [12]. Motivated by the\nline of work on the multi-antenna broadcast channel, in this note we present a different approach to\ncharacterize the secrecy capacity of the multi-antenna wiretap channel. Our approach is based on\nan extremal entropy inequality recently proved in the context of multi-antenna broadcast channels\n[13, 14], and is directly built on the physical intuition regarding to the optimal transmission strategy\nin this communication scenario.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\n2.1\n\nCapacity Characterization via a Channel Enhancement\nArgument\nCapacity characterization\n\nWe consider a canonical version of the channel (vector Gaussian wiretap channel)\nyr [m] = x[m] + wr [m]\nye [m] = x[m] + we [m],\n\n(10)\n\nwhere x[m] is a real input vector of length t, and wr [m] and we [m] are additive Gaussian noise\nvectors with zero mean and covariance matrix Kr and Ke respectively and are independent across\nthe time index m. The noise covariance matrices Kr and Ke are assumed to be positive definite.\nThe channel input satisfies a power-covariance constraint\nn\n1X\nx[m]xt [m] \u0016 S\nn m=1\n\n(11)\n\nwhere S is a positive definite matrix of size t \u00d7 t, and \"\u0016\" represents \"less or equal to\" in the\npositive semidefinite partial ordering between real symmetric matrices. Note that (11) is a rather\ngeneral constraint that subsumes many other constraints including the total power constraint (2).\nFollowing [12, Sec. 5], it can be shown that for any channel gain matrices Hr and He , there exists\na sequence of vector Gaussian wiretap channels (10) whose capacities approach that of the multiantenna wiretap channel (1). Without loss of generality, we shall focus on the vector Gaussian\nwiretap channel (10) with power-covariance constraint (11) for the rest of the note.\nWe first present a matrix characterization for the secrecy capacity of a degraded vector Gaussian\nwiretap channel.\nTheorem 1: If there exists a positive semidefinite matrix K\u2217x \u0016 S such that\n(K\u2217x + Kr )\u22121 = (K\u2217x + Ke )\u22121 + M2\n(S \u2212 K\u2217x )M2 = 0\n\n(12)\n\nfor some positive semidefinite matrix M2 , the secrecy capacity of a degraded vector Gaussian wiretap\nchannel (10) with Kr \u0016 Ke can be written as\nC=\n\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u2217 \u22121\nlog det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\n\u2212\nlog\ndet\nI\n+\nK\nK\n.\nr\nx e\n2\n2\n\n(13)\n\nTheorem 1 states that if there exists a positive semidefinite matrix K\u2217x \u0016 S that satisfies (12),\nthen U = X \u223c N (0, K\u2217x) is an optimal choice for the capacity expression (3) of a degraded vector\n4\n\n\fGaussian wiretap channel. Note that this provided a sufficient condition to evaluate optimality for\na specific choice of (U, X). To put in perspective, proving the optimality of Gaussian U = X for\nthe degraded vector Gaussian wiretap channel can be done with relative ease using, for example,\nthe worst additive noise result of Diggavi and Cover [15]. However, even within the Gaussians, it\nis not clear how one could obtain a sufficient condition for the optimal choice of the covariance\nmatrix, as the matrix optimization problem is (once again) a nonconvex one and the standard\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition is (a priori) only a necessary condition.\nProof of Theorem 1: For a degraded wiretap channel P (Yr , Ye |X), Wyner [4] showed that the\nsecrecy capacity is given by\nmax [I(X; Yr ) \u2212 I(X; Ye )] .\n(14)\nP (X)\n\nIt thus follows that the secrecy capacity of a degraded vector Gaussian wiretap channel (10) with\nKr \u0016 Ke can be written as\n[I(X; X + Wr ) \u2212 I(X; X + We )]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n=\nmax\n[h(X + Wr ) \u2212 h(X + We )] \u2212\nlog det Kr \u2212 log det Ke .\n2\n2\nf (X): E[XXt ]\u0016S\n\nC =\n\nmax\n\nf (X): E[XXt ]\u0016S\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Wr and We are length-t Gaussian vectors with zero mean and covariance matrix Kr and Ke\nrespectively and are independent of X. As a special case of Lemma 2 in [14], we have\n1\n1\n(17)\nmax t [h(X + Wr ) \u2212 h(X + We )] \u2264 log det (K\u2217x + Kr ) \u2212 log det (K\u2217x + Ke ) .\n2\n2\nf (X): E[XX ]\u0016S\n(Inequality (17) was also implicitly used in [13, Appendix C]. For completeness, a proof is included\nin Appendix A.) Substituting (17) into (16), we obtained the desired result (13). This completes\nthe proof.\n\u0004\nNext, we use a channel enhancement argument to lift the result of Theorem 1 to the general vector Gaussian wiretap channel. Channel enhancement argument was first introduced by Weingarten\net al. [12] to characterize the capacity region of the multi-antenna broadcast channel. Here, adaptations are made to fit our purposes. The difference between the channel enhancement argument\nhere and that of Weingarten et al. [12] will be explained at the end of Sec. 2.2.\nTheorem 2: The secrecy capacity of a general vector Gaussian wiretap channel (10) can be written\nas\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(18)\nC = max\nlog det I + Kx Kr \u2212 log det I + Kx Ke\n0\u0016 Kx \u0016S 2\n2\nwhere an optimal Kx (denoted here as K\u2217x ) must satisfy\n(K\u2217x + Kr )\u22121 + M1 = (K\u2217x + Ke )\u22121 + M2\nK\u2217x M1 = 0\n(S \u2212 K\u2217x )M2 = 0\n5\n\n(19)\n\n\ffor some positive semidefinite matrices M1 and M2 .\nNote that unlike Theorem 1, the characterization (19) for the optimal covariance matrix Kx is\nbased on the standard KKT condition and hence is only a necessary condition.\nProof of Theorem 2: Let K\u2217x be an optimal solution to the optimization problem in (18). By the\nKKT condition, K\u2217x must satisfy the equations in (19). Recall the single-letter capacity expression\n(3) and let U = X \u223c N (0, K\u2217x). The secrecy capacity of a general vector Gaussian wiretap channel\n(10) can be bounded from below as\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u2217 \u22121\nlog det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\nlog\ndet\nI\n+\nK\nK\n\u2212\n.\n(20)\nr\nx e\n2\n2\nTo prove the reverse inequality, consider a new vector Gaussian wiretap channel with legitimate\nreceiver and eavesdropper noise covariance matrix being K\u0303r and Ke respectively, where K\u0303r is defined\nthrough the equation\n(K\u2217x + K\u0303r )\u22121 = (K\u2217x + Kr )\u22121 + M1 .\n(21)\nC\u2265\n\nFollowing Lemmas 10 and 11 of [12], K\u0303r has the following important properties:\n1. 0 \u0016 K\u0303r \u0016 {Kr , Ke };\n\u2217 \u22121\n2. det(I + K\u2217x K\u0303\u22121\nr ) = det(I + Kx Kr ).\n\nBy virtue of K\u0303r \u0016 Ke , the new vector Gaussian wiretap channel is a degraded one. Furthermore,\nby the first and third equation in (19) and (21) we have\n(K\u2217x + K\u0303r )\u22121 = (K\u2217x + Ke )\u22121 + M2\n(S \u2212 K\u2217x )M2 = 0.\nIt thus follows from Theorem 1 that the secrecy capacity of this new channel is equal to\n\u0010\n\u0011 1\n\u0001\n1\nC\u0303 =\nlog det I + K\u2217x K\u0303\u22121\n\u2212 log det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\nr\ne\n2\n2\n\u0001\n\u0001\n1\n1\nlog det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\n\u2212 log det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\n=\nr\ne\n2\n2\n\n(22)\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nwhere the last equality is due to the second property of K\u0303r . Note from the first property of K\u0303r\nthat K\u0303r \u0016 Kr . Reducing the noise covariance matrix for the legitimate receiver can only increase\nthe secrecy capacity, so we have\n\u0001 1\n\u0001\n1\n\u2212 log det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\n(25)\nC \u2264 C\u0303 = log det I + K\u2217x K\u22121\nr\ne\n2\n2\nwhich is the desired reverse inequality. Putting together (20) and (25) completes the proof of the\ntheorem.\n\u0004\n6\n\n\f2.2\n\nPhysical intuition\n\nOur approach of characterizing the secrecy capacity of the vector Gaussian wiretap channel hinges\non the existence of an enhanced channel, which needs to satisfy:\n1. it is degraded, so the secrecy capacity can be readily characterized;\n2. it has the same secrecy capacity as the original wiretap channel.\nA priori, it is not clear whether such an enhanced channel would always exist, letting alone to\nactually construct one.\nOur intuition regarding to the existence of the enhanced channel was mainly from the parallel\nGaussian wiretap channel, which is a special case of the vector Gaussian wiretap channel (10) with\ndiagonal noise covariance matrices Kr and Ke . In this case, it is shown in [16] that the optimal\ntransmission strategy is to transmit only to the subchannels for which the received signal by the\nlegitimate receiver is stronger than that by the eavesdropper. Therefore, an enhanced channel can\nbe constructed by reducing the noise variance for the legitimate receiver in each of those subchannels\nto the noise variance level of the eavesdropper. Clearly, the enhanced channel thus constructed is a\ndegraded parallel Gaussian broadcast channel. Furthermore, the secrecy capacity of the enhanced\nchannel is the same as the original channel, as the noise variances for the legitimate receiver did\nnot change at all for any of the \"active\" subchannels. Therefore, at least for the special case of the\nparallel Gaussian wiretap channel, an enhanced channel does always exist.\nCarrying over to the general vector Gaussian wiretap channel, no information should be transmitted along any direction where the eavesdropper observes a stronger signal than the legitimate\nreceiver. The effective channel for the eavesdropper is thus a degraded version of the effective channel for the legitimate receiver. (This observation was also made by Khisti and Wornell [1].) This\nis the basis underlying the existence of the enhanced channel for a general vector Gaussian wiretap\nchannel.\nNote that in characterizing the capacity region of the vector Gaussian broadcast channel (a\ncanonical model for the multi-antenna broadcast channel), Weingarten et al. [12] enhanced each\nand every channel (by reducing the noise covariance matrices) from the transmitter to the receivers.\nIn our argument, however, we only enhanced the channel for the legitimate receiver. (The channel\nfor the eavesdropper did not change at all). This is due to the fact that in both arguments, the\nenhancement, a priori, must increase the capacity (secrecy or regular) of the channel. (Otherwise,\nboth arguments will break down.) Whereas reducing the noise covariances will benefit all the\nreceivers and hence improve the capacity of the vector Gaussian broadcast channel, reducing the\nnoise covariance matrix of the eavesdropper may compromise the security of the transmission scheme\n7\n\n\fand hence lower the secrecy capacity of the vector Gaussian wiretap channel. This is the key\ndifference between the channel enhancement argument here and that of Weingarten et al. [12] for\nthe vector Gaussian broadcast channel.\n\nA\n\nProof of Inequality (17)\n\nTo prove inequality (17), it is equivalent to show that X\u2217G \u223c N (0, K\u2217x ) is an optimal solution to the\noptimization problem\nmax t [h(X + Wr ) \u2212 h(X + We )]\nf (X): E[XX ]\u0016S\n\nwhich would handle the Gaussianity and the covariance matrix issues in one shot. For that purpose,\nwe shall prove that g(X) \u2264 g(X\u2217G ) where\ng(X) := h(X + Wr ) \u2212 h(X + We )\n\n(26)\n\nfor any X such that E[XXt ] \u0016 S.\nFor any X such that E[XXt ] \u0016 S and any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1], let\n\u221a\n\u221a\nX\u03bb := 1 \u2212 \u03bbX + \u03bbX\u2217G\n\n(27)\n\nwhere we assume that X and X\u2217G are independent. By the de-Bruijn identity [5, Cha. 16.6],\n1\ndg(X\u03bb)\n=\nTr ((K\u2217x + Kr )J(X\u03bb + Wr ) \u2212 (K\u2217x + Ke )J(X\u03bb + We ))\nd\u03bb\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\n(28)\n\nwhere J(X) denotes the Fisher information matrix of X. Recalling the vector Fisher information\ninequality [14, Lemma 1]\nJ(X1 + X2 ) \u0016 AJ(X1 )At + (I \u2212 A)J(X2)(I \u2212 A)t\n\n(29)\n\nfor two independent random vectors X1 and X2 and letting\nA = (K\u2217x + Ke )\u22121 (K\u2217x + Kr ),\n\n(30)\n\nwe have\nJ(X\u03bb + Wr ) \u0016 A\u22121 (J(X\u03bb + We ) \u2212 (I \u2212 A)J(W)(I \u2212 A)t )A\u2212t\n= (K\u2217x + Kr )\u22121 ((K\u2217x + Ke )J(X\u03bb + We )(K\u2217x + Ke ) \u2212 (Ke \u2212 Kr ))(K\u2217x + Kr )\u22121 (31)\n\n8\n\n\fwhere W is N (0, Ke \u2212 Kr ) and is independent of (Wr , X, X\u2217G ). Substituting (31) into (28), we\nhave\n\u0001\n1\ndg(X\u03bb)\n\u2265\nTr (K\u2217x + Kr )(J(X\u03bb + Wr )(K\u2217x + Kr ) \u2212 I)((K\u2217x + Kr )\u22121 \u2212 (K\u2217x + Ke )\u22121 )\nd\u03bb\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n1\nTr ((K\u2217x + Kr )(J(X\u03bb + Wr )(K\u2217x + Kr ) \u2212 I)M2 )\n(32)\n=\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\u0001\n1\n(33)\n\u2265\nTr (K\u2217x + Kr )((S + Kr )\u22121 (K\u2217x + Kr ) \u2212 I)M2\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n\u0001\n1\n=\nTr (K\u2217x + Kr )(S + Kr )\u22121 (K\u2217x \u2212 S)M2\n2(1 \u2212 \u03bb)\n= 0\n(34)\nwhere equalities (32) and (34) are due to the equations in (12), and inequality (33) is due to the\nwell-known Cram\u00e9r-Rao inequality\nJ(X) \u0017 Cov\u22121 (X)\n(35)\nand the fact that Cov(X) \u0016 E[XXt ] \u0016 S. That is, g(X\u03bb ) is a monotonically nondecreasing function\nof \u03bb in [0, 1]. We thus have\ng(X) = g(X0 ) \u2264 g(X1 ) = g(X\u2217G ).\n(36)\n\nThis completes the proof of inequality (17).\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Khisti and G. W.
