Low energy configurations are optimized using the prunedenriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM), hitherto employed to native state searches only for off lattice\nmodels. For 2 dimensions we found states with lower energy than previously proposed putative\nground states, for all chain lengths \u2265 13. This indicates that PERM has the potential to produce\nnative states also for more realistic protein models. For d = 3, where no published ground states\nexist, we present some putative lowest energy states for future comparison with other methods.\n\nPredicting the structure of a protein, given its sequence\nof amino acids, is one of the central problems in computational biology. Since the problem is too difficult to be\napproached with fully realistic potentials derived from\nfirst principles, many authors have studied it in various\ndegrees of simplifications. This involves in particular neglect of solvent water, simplifying the interactions, lumping together smaller groups of atoms, and putting everything on a discrete lattice. Among the most radically\nsimplified models is the HP model of Dill and coworkers\n[1] where each amino acid is treated as a point particle\non a regular (quadratic or cubic) lattice, and only two\ntypes of amino acids \u2013 hydrophobic (H) and polar (P)\n\u2013 are considered. Apart from the forces responsible for\nthe connectedness of the chain, the only forces are contact forces between nearest lattice neighbours which are\ndifferent for HH, HP, and PP pairs.\n\nEven in this highly simplified model it is far from trivial to predict the native state for a given amino acid sequence [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The most efficient algorithms are\neither deterministic and cannot be generalized to more\nrealistic models at all [7], or use sequential importance\nsampling with re-sampling in the form of the prunedenriched-Rosenbluth method (PERM) [6]. Although it\nwas shown that the latter can be applied also to off-lattice\nhomopolymers at higher temperatures [8], it is not obvious that it will be efficient for off-lattice heteropolymers\nat the low temperatures needed for protein folding.\n\nWhile there are a large number of benchmark cases\nfor lattice protein models in the literature, there exist very few simple off-lattice models with known lowest energy states that can be used as benchmarks for\nefficient algorithms. One such model is the so-called\nAB model by Stillinger et al [9, 10] which also uses\nonly two types of monomers, called now \"A\" (hydrophobic) and \"B\"(polar). The distances between consecutive\nmonomers along the chain are held fixed to b = 1, while\nnon-consecutive monomers interact through a modified\nLennard-Jones potential. In addition, there is an energy contribution from each angle \u03b8i between successive\nbonds. More precisely, the total energy for a N monomer\n\nchain is expressed as\nE=\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nE1 (\u03b8i ) +\n\nN\n\u22122\nX\n\nN\nX\n\nE2 (rij , \u03b6i , \u03b6j ),\n\n(1)\n\ni=1 j=i+2\n\ni=2\n\nwhere\nE1 (\u03b8i ) =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8i ),\n4\n\n\u221212\n\u22126\nE2 (rij , \u03b6i , \u03b6j ) = 4(rij\n\u2212 C(\u03b6i , \u03b6j )rij\n).\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nHere rij is the distance between monomers i and j (with\ni < j). Each \u03b6i is either A or B, and C(\u03b6i , \u03b6j ) is +1, + 21 ,\nand \u2212 21 respectively, for AA, BB, and AB pairs, giving\nstrong attraction between AA pairs, weak attraction between BB pairs, and weak repulsion between A and B.\nThis model has been studied in several papers [9, 10,\n11, 12, 13] For its 2-d version, putative ground states for\nvarious AB sequences and for various chain lengths are\ngiven in [9, 10, 13]. Similar models were also studied\nin [11, 12, 14, 15], but putative ground states for these\ngeneralizations were not given at all or for very short\nchains only. The methods used to find low energy states\nof the AB model include neural networks [9], conventional Metropolis type Monte Carlo procedures [10], simulated tempering [11], multicanonical Monte Carlo [12],\nbiologically motivated methods [13, 15], and molecular\ndynamics [14]. In all cases the stochastic minimization\ncan only lead to some state in the neighbourhood of a\nlocal (and hopefully also global) minimum. A greedy deterministic method such as conjugate gradient descent is\nsubsequently applied to reach the minimum itself.\nIt is the purpose of the present paper to see whether\nPERM can be efficient for energy minimization in the\nAB model. In particular we shall use the new variant\nof PERM presented in [6]. We shall restrict ourselves\nto the subclass of \"Fibonacci sequences\" studied also in\n[10], defined recursively by\nS0 = A,\n\nS1 = B,\n\nSi+1 = Si\u22121 \u2217 Si\n\n(4)\n\n. Here * is the concatenation operator. The first few\nsequences are S2 = AB, S3 = BAB, S4 = ABBAB,\netc. They have lengths given by Ni+1 = Ni\u22121 + Ni , i.e\n\n\f2\nN = 13\n\nN = 21\n\nwill evolve differently during the subsequent growth\n(as in original PERM), we now branch such that the\nlast monomers are different at the point of branching.\nThereby we now force the two copies to be distinct, and\nwe avoid the loss of diversity that also plagues genetic\nalgorithms when the evolution pressure is too high.\nN = 13\n\nN = 34\n\nN = 55\n\nN = 21\n\nFIG. 1: Putative ground states of Fibonacci sequences listed\nin Table I in 2 \u2212 d space. Full dots indicate hydrophobic\nmonomers.\nN = 34\n\ngiven by the Fibonacci numbers. Hydrophobic residues\n(A) occur isolated along the chain, while Bs occur either\nisolated or in pairs. The fraction of Bs tends to the\ngolden mean \u03b3 = 0.618 033 as the length N \u2192 \u221e.\nAlthough PERM gives also detailed information about\nexcited states and thermodynamic behaviour at temperatures T > 0, we shall not discuss this here. For studying\nthe dynamics of the folding transition, in contrast, we\nwould have to assume some realistic microscopic dynamics. Just like other advanced sampling methods such as\nsimulated annealing or parallel tempering, PERM sacrifices the realism of the dynamics for efficiency. In addition, as in the studies mentioned above, PERM is only\nused for coming close to the native state, and conjugate\ngradient descent is then used to reach the minimum energy state itself.\nPERM is a biased chain growth algorithm with \"population control\", i.e. a sequential importance sampling\nmethod with re-sampling [16], implemented recursively\nin a depth first fashion [8]. While chains grow, they\nacquire weights that include both Boltzmann factors\nand bias correction (\"Rosenbluth\" [17]) factors. During\nthe growth, samples with large weight are cloned, while\nchains with too small weight are pruned out. Except\nfor the depth-first implementation and for the fact that\nit gives the correct Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics, PERM\nresembles therefore genetic algorithms. While the original version of PERM was quite successful for lattice proteins [18, 19] and for a host of other applications [20], it\nworked rather poorly for minimization of off-lattice polymer models [21].\nIn this paper we therefore employ an improved version called nPERMis in [6] (for \"new PERM with importance sampling\"). Basically, instead of making exact\nclones of high weight chains and hoping that these clones\n\nN = 55\n\nFIG. 2: Stereographic views of putative ground states of 3\u2212d\nFibonacci sequences listed in Table I. Again, A monomers are\nshown as filled circles.\n\nFor lattice polymers [6] one has for each partially grown\nchain a finite number of \"candidate directions\" for the\nnext step. One first estimates the total weight of all these\none-step continuations. Based on this estimate, one decides on the number of clones to be made. If, say, one\nwants to make k clones, one scans all possible k-tuples\nof possible different candidate directions, and selects one\nof these tuples according to its weight. For off-lattice\npolymers one proceeds exactly in the same way, with one\nexception: The candidates are now no longer the lattice\nbonds, but one has to choose K candidate locations for\nthe next monomer randomly. The number K is an important parameter. While K \u2248 5 was optimal for 3-d\npolymers near the \u0398-point [8], we found that lowest energies were reached in the AB model for K \u2248 50. While\nit was necessary to make clonings with very many siblings in simulating the HP model with the old version of\n\n\f3\nTABLE I: Sequences and energies reached. Eperm is the lowest energy obtained by a PERM run, while Emin is the minimum\n\u2217\nenergy obtained by subsequent conjugate gradient minimization.

We typically used temperatures well below the collapse transition, kT \u2248 0.1 or\neven lower. In order to speed up the ground state search,\nwe also modified the Lennard-Jones potential by putting\nE2 (r) = +\u221e for r < 1. This hard core constraint reduces\nthe available phase space, but has no effect on ground\nstate configurations (we did not use it in the conjugate\ngradient minimization, and we checked that it was satisfied after minimization). For chain deformation algorithms it could slow down the dynamics, since the hard\ncores could act as barriers, but it can only improve any\npure chain growth algorithm. Finally, as a last trick,\nwe used equally spaced azimuthal angles for all candidates (with one overall angle chosen at random, for each\ngroup of candidates), in order to make them cover the\nunit sphere more uniformly. All simulations were done\non Linux and UNIX workstations. CPU times were up to\n2 days, but their precise values are not very significant.\nExact timings would involve frequent comparisons of the\nminimizer basins of attraction reached by PERM, which\nwe considered as too time consuming.\nIn Table I we list the lowest energies thus obtained\nfor the two- and three-dimensional AB model for all Fibonacci sequences with 13 \u2264 N \u2264 55. The latter is equal\nto the length of the longest sequence studied in [10]. Let\nus first discuss the case d = 2. For comparison we quote\nalso the putative ground state energies from Table II of\n[10]. For N < 13, our energies agree perfectly with those\nof [10]. Except for the shortest chain with N = 13, already PERM gave in all cases shown in Table I lower\nenergies than those found in [10]. In all these cases already PERM by itself showed that the topologies shown\nin [10] are not the native ones. While the subsequent\ngradient descent improved the energies substantially, it\nchanged in no case the overall topology.\nThe latter is true also for d = 3, although there the\nsubsequent minimization gave even larger energy changes\nthan in d = 2. This shows that in d = 3, too, PERM is\nable to find states very close to the native ones. Since\n\nd=3\n\nthere exist no published ground state energies for the\n3 \u2212 d AB model, we are unable to compare PERM with\nother methods.\nThe configurations corresponding to the energies\nshown in Table I are shown in Figs. 1 (for d = 2) and\n2 (for d = 3). For d = 2 we see that none of the configurations, except the one for N = 13, have single hydrophobic cores. Instead, the hydrophobic (A) monomers form\nclusters of typically 4 to 5 particles. This is easily explained by the fact that hydrophobic monomers always\nare flanked by polar monomers along the chain. Thus\na clean separation into hydrophobic and polar regions\nis impossible. This shows that the AB model with Fibonacci sequences would be a very poor model for real\nproteins in d = 2. From Fig. 3 we see that the same is\ntrue to a lesser degree in d = 3. There the chains with\nN = 21 and N = 34 fold into configurations with single\nhydrophobic cores (except for a single A monomer which\nkeeps out in both cases), and only the chain with N = 55\nforms 2 clearly disjoint main hydrophobic groups.\nIn conclusion we have extended the PERM algorithm\nto an off-lattice two-species protein model. We have\nshown that it performs well, indeed we are able to refute with it previous claims for putative ground states.\nThe chosen model is not very realistic. Partly this\nfollows from the restriction to two types of monomers,\npartly from the fact that we did not include, as in\n[11], more realistic local (bond angle and torsion) forces,\nand partly from the restriction to Fibonacci sequences.\nEach of this features could have been easily avoided, and\nPERM works indeed equally well if we modify any of\nthem. But it was not our aim to present a realistic model.\nRather we wanted to treat a model which is suitable for\nbenchmarking, because of it is defined in a simple way\nand because it was already studied in detail before.\nIt is less obvious whether PERM would also perform\nwell for all-atom models with realistic potentials, or even\nwith explicit solvents. Typically, its performance decreases quite rapidly with the number of degrees of freedom, but presumably it shares this with other modern\nmethods like multicanonical sampling and parallel tempering. To answer this question, we have started such\n\n\f4\nsimulations with the ECEPP force field implemented in\nSMMP [22]. But it is still too early to draw any conclusions.\n\nAcknowledgments: We thank Walter Nadler for numerous very fruitful discussions and for critically reading\nthe manuscript.\n\n[1] K. F.
