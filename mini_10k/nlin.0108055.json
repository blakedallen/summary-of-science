ATOMIC\nRESEARCH CENTRE\nTROMBAY, BOMBAY-400085 INDIA\n\nAbstract\nWe introduce a metric on the set of all subsets of natural numbers which\nconverts it into a cantor set.On this set endowed with the metric, we introduce\na very simple map which exhibits chaotic behaviour.This simple map is almost\nlike a nursery rhyme of chaos.\n\n1\n\n\fThe set of all subsets of natural numbers is a much larger set than the set of natural\nnumbers.In fact, it has the cardinality of the set of real numbers.We shall denote the set of\nall subsets of natural numbers by the symbol \u03a3, set of natural numbers by N, subsets of\nnatural numbers by \u03b1, \u03b2 etc.\n\u03b1 = (n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ...)\n\u03b2 = (m1 , m2 , ..., mk , ...)\n\n(1)\n\nHere nk and mk are natural numbers and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2282 N and \u2208 \u03a3.On the set \u03a3 , we define\nsymmetric set theoretic difference as\n\u03b3 \u2261 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)\n= (\u03b1\n\n[\n\n\u03b2) \\ (\u03b1\n\n= (\u03b1 \\ \u03b2)\n\n\\\n\n\u03b2)\n\n[\n\n(\u03b2 \\ \u03b1)\n\n(2)\n\nWe now define on the set \u03a3 a norm as follows (1) To the null set \u2205, we associate zero i.e.,\nk\u2205k = 0 (2) To the set \u03b1 = (n1 , n2 , ..., nk ), we associate either\nX\n\nk\u03b1k =\n\n(1/M nk )\n\n(3)\n\nnk \u2208\u03b1\n\nwhere M \u2265 2.In fact, we take M = 2. or\nkS1 k =\n\nX\n\n(1/nk !)\n\n(4)\n\nnk \u2208\u03b1\n\nIn this paper, we will use the first definition of the norm though we might as well have used\nthe second one. The distance between two subsets \u03b1 and \u03b2 is given by\nk(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)k \u2261 k\u03b3k\n= k(\u03b1\n\n[\n\n\u03b2) \\ (\u03b1\n\n= k(\u03b1 \\ \u03b2)\n\n[\n\n\\\n\n\u03b2)k\n\n(\u03b2 \\ \u03b1)k\n\n(5)\n\nIt is clear from the definitions that k\u03b3k = 0 imply \u03b1 = \u03b2, and the triangle inequality is easily\nsatisfied. On this set \u03a3 endowed with above mentioned metric, we introduce the \"Reduction\nby Unity\" map \u03a9, as follows\n2\n\n\f(n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ..) \u2192 (n1 \u2212 1, n2 \u2212 1, ..., nk \u2212 1, ...)\n(6)\nif none of nk = 1.If one of nk , say n1 = 1, then\n(1, n2 , ..., nk , ....) \u2192 (n2 \u2212 1, ..., nk \u2212 1, ....)\n\n(7)\n\nIt is clear from the definition that the \"Reduction by Unity\" map \u03a9 is two-to-one.\nThe above structures defined on the set \u03a3 are very natural. We explain this by the\nfollowing physical example.Let us consider an infinite number of boxes.Any number of boxes\ncan be empty or filled with particles.However, the filled boxes are such that no two boxes\nhave the same number of particles.The configuration of the particles in the boxes can be\nrepresented by the sequences (n1 , n2 , ..., nk , .....) where n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ... are distinct positive\nintegers.Note that we do not have zero as an entry in the sequences even though there are\nany number of empty boxes because for the process to be described in the following these\nempty boxes are irrelevant except when all of them are empty. We describe a process of\nevaporation of particles from the boxes in the following way: at a time from each box a\nsingle particle is evaporated.In other words, we define evaporation per unit time via the the\nmap (n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ...) \u2192 (n1 \u2212 1, n2 \u2212 1, ..., nk \u2212 1, ...) (if n1 = 1, then there is no entry\nat the location of n1 \u2212 1). Note that this map is two-to-one.We arrive at the configuration\n(n1 \u22121, n2 \u22121, ..., nk \u22121, ....) either from the evaporation of the configuration (n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ....)\nor (1, n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ....).The dynamics of the evaporation can not be analysed any more unless\nwe introduce some kind of distance or metric on the set of all possible configuration of the\nparticles in the boxes.This will tell us how far or close particle configurations are from each\nother.An adhoc mathematical definition would do the job. However, we shall try to be as\nclose as possible to a physical situation. It is natural to assume that two configurations with\nsimilar number of particles in the boxes are closer to each other than those with different\nnumber of particles.The more the dissimilar number of entries in the two configurations\nthe further they are.Another assumption we would like to make is that two configurations\ndiffering from each other in very large entries are not too far from each other.This sounds a bit\n3\n\n\funatural.However, it is required mathematically.Note that the configuration \u2205, corresponding\nto \"no particle\" in any of the boxes also belongs to the set of all possble configurations.\nTherefore, the distance of any configuration from the null configuration \u2205 essentially defines\na norm.Now if the distance between two configurations keep increasing with larger entries\nof particles in the boxes there will be problem with convergence of the norm.Therefore, the\ntwo requirement mentioned above are necessary for defining a proper metric.This metric\nintroduces an interesting scenario for the evaporation process: there is a temporal scale\nseparation- the short time and long time behaviour of the evaporation is different in the\nsense that two generic configurations which stay close to each other in short time separate\nexponentially from each other in the long time.In fact, what will be proven in this paper is\nthat the set of possible configurations of particles in the boxes (i.e., the set of all subsets\nof natural numbers \u03a3) is a Cantor set and the evaporation process (i.e.,the \"Reduction by\nUnity\" map \u03a9 on \u03a3) is chaotic.\nA set is called a Cantor set if it is closed, totally disconnected and is a perfect set.\"Closed\"\nmeans every sequence of of its' points converges to some point within the set. \"Totally diconnected\" means it contains no interval.A perfect set means every point in it is an accumulation\npoint.The classical example of a Cantor set is the \"Cantor middle-thirds\" set.The \"Cantor\nmiddle-thirds\" set is nicely described by Cantor map\nF (x) = 3x for\n\n\u2212 \u221e < x \u2264 1/2\n\n= 3(1 \u2212 x) for\n\n1/2 < x \u2264 \u221e\n\n(8)\n\non the real line R.Note that most points of the real line R go to \u2212\u221e under the iteration of\nthe Cantor map.However, there exists a set which is a subset of the interval I=[0,1] that\ndoes stay within the interval I and is invariant under the iteration of the map F(x).This is\nprecisely the \"Cantor middle-thirds\" set.The Cantor map F(x) on this set is chaotic [1,2].This\nmeans that,\n(1) The map has the property of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.\n(2) It has dense set of periodic orbits.\n4\n\n\f(3) It has a topologically transitive (chaotic) trajectory i.e., a trajectory which goes\narbitrary close to every point in the set.\nWe shall proof that the set of all subsets of natural numbers, \u03a3 endowed with the metric\nintroduced in begining of paper, is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.In other words there\nexists, between the \"Cantor middle-thirds\" set and the set of all subsets of natural numbers,\n\u03a3, a mapping which is one-one , onto and continuous along with the the inverse.We shall\nalso proof that the Cantor map on Cantor set is topologically conjugate to the \"Reduction\nby Unity\" map on \u03a3.\nFrom the definition of the Cantor map, note that F \u2032 (x) = 3, and this means that the\nmap is expansive.Moreover, F \u22121 (I), where I = [0, 1],consists of two subintervals I0 = [0, 1/3]\nand I1 = [2/3, 1].Also for any subinerval J \u2282 I, F \u22121 (J) consists of two subintervals, one\nin I0 and the other in I1 .The length of the subinterval J is 3-times the length of either of\nthe subintervals F \u22121 (J). Also, F \u2212n (I0 ) and F \u2212n (I1 ) \u2192 0 as 3\u2212n . These properties of the\nCantor map can be used to establish a homeomorphism between \u039b, the Cantor set and the\nset \u03a3.\nLet us construct the itinerary S(x) of a point x under the Cantor map F(x),\nS(x) = (n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ....)\n\n(9)\n\nThe symbols nj are introduced in the following way: nj \u2208 S(x) if F nj \u22121 (x) \u2208 I0 . It will\nbe argued that S(x) defined above is a homeomorphism.Firstly, it is obvious that to every\npoint x \u2208 \u039b, where \u039b is the Cantor set, there is sequenc S(x) i.e., a subset of \u03a3.\nNow we proof that to every subset of \u03a3 there is a point x \u2208 \u039b. Let \u03b7 = (1, 2, ..., n) and\n\u03be, \u03b6 \u2282 \u03b7. \u03be\n\nS\n\n\u03b6 = \u03b7 and \u03be\n\nT\n\n\u03b6 = \u2205, the nullset. Define \u03be1 and \u03b61 as two sets obtained from\n\n\u03be and \u03b6 by \"Unit Reduction map\".Therefore, \u03be1\n\u03be1\n\nT\n\nS\n\n\u03b61 = \u03b71 , where \u03b71 = (1, 2, ..., n \u2212 1) and\n\n\u03b61 = \u2205, the nullset.Define,\nn\nI\u03be,\u03b6\n= {x \u2208 I\n\n| F k\u22121(x) \u2208 I0\n\nk \u2208 \u03be, F k\u22121(x) \u2208 I1\n5\n\nfor\n\nfor k \u2208 \u03b6}\n\n\f=(\n\n\\\n\nF \u2212k+1 (I0 ))(\n\nk\u2208\u03be\n\n\\\n\nF \u2212k+1(I1 ))\n\n(10)\n\nk\u2208\u03b6\n\nn\nLet us proof that I\u03be,\u03b6\nis a connected interval. First note that integer, 1 \u2208 \u03be or 1 \u2208 \u03b6,\n\ntherefore,\nn\nI\u03be,\u03b6\n= (I0\n\nor I1 )\n\n\\\n\nF \u22121 (I\u03ben\u22121\n)\n1 ,\u03b61\n\n(11)\n\nBy induction, we assume that I\u03ben\u22121\nis non-empty connected subinterval.Therefore, F \u22121 (I\u03ben\u22121\n)\n1 ,\u03b61\n1 ,\u03b61\nconsists of two subintervals one in I0 and the other in I1 .Therefore, (I0\n\nor I1 )\n\nT\n\nF \u22121 (I\u03ben\u22121\n)\n1 ,\u03b61\n\nconsists of a single interval.These intervals are nested.To prove this, we introduce slightly\ndifferent notations.\nI n = {x \u2208 I\n\n| F k\u22121 (x) \u2208 I0\n\nk \u2208 \u03be, F k\u22121(x) \u2208 I1\nI n\u22121 = [x \u2208 I\n\nfor\n\nfor k \u2208 \u03b6}\n\n| F k\u22121 (x) \u2208 I0\n\nfor\n\nk \u2208 \u03be2 , F k\u22121(x) \u2208 I1 fork \u2208 \u03b62\n\n(12)\n\n\u03be2 = \u03be if the integer n is not an entry in the set \u03be, otherwise \u03be2 is obtained from the set \u03be\nonly by dropping the integer n.\u03b62 is defined similarly.

The subintervals I n are contained in I0 or I1 and their lengths\ntend to zero as n \u2192 \u221e, and, therefore, the intersection is a unique point. Now, when\nn\nn \u2192 \u221e, I\u03be,\u03b6\nis totally given by \u03be, and \u03b6 is just its' complement in the set of natural\n\nnumbers.Therefore, to every subset \u03be \u2208 \u03a3, the set of all subsets natural numbers, there\nexists a unique point x \u2208 \u039b, the Cantor set.This implies that the itinerary, S(x) is onto.\nThat distinct points of Cantor set, \u039b correspond to different subsets of natural numbers\ncan be seen from the fact that the subintervals I n (x),containing the point x, ( constructed in\n6\n\n\fthe previous section) tend to zero as 3\u2212n+1 when n \u2192 \u221e.For x 6= y, consider neighbourhoods\n\u05d0x and \u05d0y of x and y such that \u05d0x\n\nT\n\n\u05d0y = \u2205.Since the length of the subintervals I n \u2192 0 as\n\n3\u2212n+1 , there exist an n\u22c6 , such that for n > n\u22c6 I n (x) \u2208 \u05d0x and I n (y) \u2208 \u05d0y .\nIn order to proof continuity, let us choose an \u01eb.Now choose n such that 1/2n < \u01eb.Let\nn\nx \u2208 \u039b and S(x) = (n1 , n2 , ..., nk , ....).Consider all subintervals of the form I\u03be,\u03b6\nwith n fixed\n\nbut \u03be and \u03b6 varying. There are 2n + 1 such intervals. These subintervals are disjoint and \u039b\nis contained in the union of them.Hence, we can choose a \u03b4 such that | x \u2212 y | < \u03b4, and\ny \u2208 \u039b, imply that y \u2208 I n (x). Therefore, itinerary of the of the points , S(x) and S(y) agree\non n entries.Now, from the metric on \u03a3 it follows that\nk(S(x) \u2212 S(y))k \u2264 1/2n < \u01eb\n\n(14)\n\nThis proves continuity.Similarly, one can prove continuity of the inverse.Therefore, the\nitinerary S(x) of points x \u2208 \u039b is a homeomorphism between the Cantor set, \u039b and the\nset of all subsets of natural number \u03a3.A set homeomorphic to a Cantor set is itself a Cantor\nset. This proves the main claim of the paper.\nNow, we describe some interesting and important corrolaries of this result. Now, we\nprove that the \"Reduction by Unity\" map \u03a9 on set \u03a3 and Cantor map F(x) on set \u039b are\ntopologically conjugate to each other.In other words,\nS \u25e6 F (x) = \u03a9 \u25e6 S(x)\n\n(15)\n\nA point x \u2208 \u039b is uniquely determined by intersection of nested sequence of intervals\n\nT\n\nn\n\nIn\n\nThese subintervals as argued earlier in the paper are determined by the itinerary S(x).\nn\nI\u03be,\u03b6\n\n= (I0\n\nor I1 )\n\n\\\n\nF \u22121 (I\u03ben\u22121\n)\n1 ,\u03b61\n\n(16)\n\nAs explained earlier, \u03be1 , \u03b61 are obtained from \u03be and \u03b6 by unit reduction map.

When \u03b2 = \u2205, \u03b1 = N, and therefore, according to the\n\ndefination above h\u2205 (x) = 0 and corresponds to set \u2205 \u2208 \u03a3. It is clear from the defination\nthat functions h(x) are obtained from the exponential series\nexp(x) = 1 + x +\n\nx2\nxk\n+ .... +\n+ ....\n2!\nk!\n(20)\n\nby randomly dropping finite or infinite number of terms.We deote this set functions as \u039e.We\nintroduce on the set of functions, \u039e a metric in the following way,\nk(h\u03b1 (x) \u2212 h\u03b2 (x))k =\n\n(n)\n\n| h(n)\n\u03b1 (x) \u2212 h\u03b2 (x) |\n2n\nn=0\n\u221e\nX\n\nx=0\n\n(21)\n\nth\nhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are any subset in \u03a3 and h(n)\nderivative of h\u03b1 (x).It is clear that\n\u03b1 (x) is the n\n\nk(h\u03b1 (x) \u2212 h\u03b2 (x))k = 0 imply h\u03b1 (x) = h\u03b2 (x) and the triangle inequality is satisfied.It is very\n8\n\n\feasily proven that the set of randomly diluted exponetial functions, \u039e is a Cantor set in the\nabove metric and the \"Derivative\" map on the functions of \u039e is chaotic.\nI thank Agha A.
