With the help of the well-known SOFTSUSY code the dependence\nof the corrections on universal MSSM parameters is analyzed. For a consistent study of\nthe influence of the corrections on SUSY mass spectrum three-loop renormalization group\nequations are implemented. A particular scenario (SPS4) is considered and the shifts of\nthe particle masses due to contributions of different threshold corrections are presented.\nAdditionally, the impact on certain forbidden regions of the parameter space is studied.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMinimal Supersymmtric Standard Model possesses many remarkable features that allows one\nto think of it as of the most viable candidate for a theory that describes physics beyond the\nStandard Model. Unfortunately, it has a lot of parameters which are related to unknown\nmasses of SUSY particles. One way to deal with the problem is to use universal parameters at\nsome high-energy scale and extrapolate them to low energies with the help of renormalization\ngroup equations (RGEs). Most of the computer codes [1] used to obtain the SUSY spectrum\nincorporate two-loop RGEs together with one-loop threshold corrections. The latter allow one\nto calculate boundary values for gauge and Yukawa couplings from the given low-energy input\nin a consistent way.\nThe necessity of threshold corrections is tightly related to the fact that the theories defined in\na minimal subtraction scheme cease to satisfy the Appelquist-Carazzone theorem [2] in a naive\nform. Heavy degrees of freedom contribute to low energy observables even in the limit when\nthe corresponding masses tend to infinity introducing potentially large logarithmic corrections.\nHowever, the latter are local and can be absorbed in the definition of the couplings of the\neffective theory and summed up with the help of a renormalization group. There exists a\nso-called matching (or decoupling) procedure that allows one to routinely calculate threshold\ncorrections.\nOne-loop decoupling corrections can be found in [3]. It turns out that sometimes they can\nsignificantly change (e.g. by 40 % for the b-quark mass) the value of the parameters defined in\nthe MSSM with respect to that in the SM. In such cases it is reasonable to calculate contributions\nfrom the next order of perturbation theory (PT).\nIt took some time to find leading two-loop corrections to matching relations between the\nstrongest SM and MSSM couplings. Strong coupling was considered in [4]. The corresponding\nresults for heavy SM fermion masses were found in [5, 6]\nIt is worth mentioning that the low-energy input to the MSSM can be given in terms\nof running SM parameters at the electroweak scale. However, there exists a distinction in\n\u2217\n\ne-mail: bednya@theor.jinr.ru\n\n1\n\n\fminimal renormalization schemes usually used in the SM and MSSM. It comes from the fact\nthat supersymmetry requires vector bosons to be accompanied by so-called \u03b5-scalars. The latter\nmaintain the balance between fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom in a dimensionally\nregularized theory. As a consequence, most calculations in the context of the MSSM made use\nof the so-called DR-scheme [7] with \u03b5-scalars implicitly (or explicitly) taken into account. This\nfact leads to the problem of DR \u2192 MS conversion since for the Standard Model the MS scheme\nis more suitable. The corresponding parameter redefinition can be done in a conventional way by\ncomparison of certain (invariant) quantities calculated in both schemes within the same model\n(SM or MSSM). However, this route leads to appearance of unphysical \"evanescent\" couplings\nif such relations are considered in the SM [8] or to supersymmetry breaking at rigid level in\nthe MSSM. Recently, it was proposed that DR parameters of the MSSM and MS parameters\nof the SM can be directly related since unphysical \u03b5-scalars can be treated along the same lines\nas heavy degrees of freedom during calculation of decoupling corrections [9].\n\n2\n\nTwo-loop matching\n\nLet me introduce necessary notation and briefly discuss practical prescription for the matching\nprocedure [10]. The task is to find relations of the type\nA(Q) = \u03b6A (\u03bc\u0304) * A(Q)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A(Q) and A(Q) are some running parameters (e.g., \u03b1s ) defined at the renormalization\nscale Q in the effective (SM) and the fundamental (MSSM) theories, respectively. The quantity\n(1)\n\n\u03b6A (Q) = 1 + \u03b4\u03b6A (Q) + \u03b4\u03b6 (2) (Q) * * *\n\n(2)\n\nis called \"decoupling constant\" for the parameter A and can be calculated order-by-order in PT.\nThe relation (1) allows one to express A in terms of A and other parameters of the fundamental\ntheory at any scale Q. In practice, however, the scale is chosen in a way to minimize uncertainties\ndue high orders of PT.\nA convenient way to find the expression for \u03b6A (Q) is to consider bare quantities and find\n\"bare\" decoupling constant \u03b6A,0\nA0 = \u03b6A,0 * A0\n(3)\nby demanding that bare Green functions calculated in both theories coincide1 in the limit of\nvanishing external momenta and masses of the considered effective field theory. In this case\nall the diagrams without heavy degrees of freedom also vanish and the problem is reduced to\ncalculation of bubble integrals with at least one heavy line with mass denoted here by M . Given\n(3) one expresses bare quantities in terms of renormalized ones\nA0 = ZA (A) A,\nA0 = ZA (A, B) A,\nh\nih\ni\u22121\n\u03b6A = ZA (A, B) ZA (A)\n\u03b6A,0 (ZA A, ZB B, ZM M ).\n\n(4)\n\nand after a proper re-expansion obtains (1). In (4) B stands for couplings presented in the\nfundamental theory that are absent in the effective one.\nLet us consider one- and two-loop contributions to the decoupling constants for the strong\ncoupling, \u03b6\u03b1s , the mass of bottom-quark, \u03b6mb , and the tau-lepton mass, \u03b6m\u03c4 . Due to the fact\nthat full two-loop calculations require evaluation of many thousands of diagrams, it is reasonable\nto consider a simplified setup and neglect electroweak gauge couplings. In this case, five-flavor\nQCD with free tau-lepton plays the role of effective theory instead of the SM. The corresponding\nlimit of the MSSM (\"gauge-less\" limit) is treated as a more fundamental theory and is used to\ncalculate threshold corrections.\n1\n\nField redefinition is also required in this case.\n\n2\n\n\f(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b4\u03b6mb (MZ ), %\n\n\u03b4\u03b6mb (MZ ), %\n\n32\n30\n28\n26\n24\n22\n20\n18\n16\n14\n\n24\n\n0.6\n\n22\n\n20\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n3.2\n\n1.2\n\n3\n1\n\n2.8\n\n0.8\n\n2\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nm1/2 , TeV\n\n11.5\n11\n10.5\n10\n9.5\n9\n8.5\n8\n7.5\n7\n\n11\n\n10\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n9\n8\n\n0.2\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4\n\n\u2206(2) mt /mt (MZ ), %\n\nmt /mt (MZ ), %\n\n1\n0.8\n\n2\n\nm0 , TeV\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n2.2\n1.8\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\nm1/2 , TeV\n\n\u2206\n\n2.4\n\n5\n\n2.\n\n0.6\n\nm0 , TeV\n(1)\n\n2.6\n\n3\n\n0.8\n\n3.4\n\n3.2\n\n28\n\n1\n\n26\n\nm1/2 , TeV\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nm1/2 , TeV\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n4\n\n1.2\n\n3.5\n3.5\n\n1\n\n3\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n1.2 1.4\n\n2\n\n2 .5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n\nm0 , TeV\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\n1.2 1.4\n\nm0 , TeV\n\nFigure 1: One- and two-loop corrections to the b-quark decoupling constant \u03b6mb and the pole\nmass Mt of t-quark as functions of universal parameters m0 and m1/2 for tan \u03b2 = 50 and A0 = 0.\nIt is worth mentioning that since the t-quark mass is of the order of electroweak scale, it is\nreasonable to use the pole mass Mt to find the boundary condition for corresponding running\nparameter mDR\nt (\u03bc\u0304) in the MSSM\n!\n\u2206(1) mt \u2206(2) mt\nDR\n+\n+ ***\nMt = mt (\u03bc\u0304) 1 +\nmt\nmt\nHere \u2206(l) mt /mt stands for l-loop contribution to the relation between Mt and mDR .\nSince two-loop expressions are very lengthy, it is convenient to analyze them numerically.\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of quark mass corrections on the MSSM universal parameters\nm0 and m1/2 . Large value of tan \u03b2 = 50 has been chosen since in this case loop corrections to the\nbottom-quark (and tau-lepton) mass are significantly enhanced. For the t-quark, contribution\ndue to Yukawa couplings is suppressed by inverse tan \u03b2 and is not taken into account.\n(2)\nI would like to stress that small values of \u03b4mb result from large cancellations of contributions\nproportional to strong and Yukawa couplings. For example, in the region of small m0 and large\nm1/2 the two-loop O(\u03b1s2 ) contribution can reach 10 %. However, negative corrections due to\nYukawa couplings lower this value down to a few per cent only.\nIn the case of \u03c4 -lepton (see upper row in Fig. 2) there are no corrections due to strong\ninteractions and the net effect is negative.

Numerical values can be found in Fig. 2 (lower row). The corrections are small in comparison with\none-loop result. Nevertheless, they can be important in studying gauge constant unification.\nIt is interesting to note that the two-loop corrections for \u03b1s , mb and mt can be approximated\nby the same value of 2-3 % for the whole considered region2 in the m0 \u2013m1/2 plane.\nAll the above-mentioned corrections were taken into account in the three-loop renormalization group analysis of the MSSM that will be presented in the next section.\n\n3\n\nThree-loop analysis of the MSSM\n\nIt is known that for a self-consistent L-loop study of the MSSM one needs to known threshold\ncorrections up to (L \u2212 1) order. Three-loop beta-functions for a rigid (supersymmetric) part of\nthe MSSM Lagrangian were calculated by means of superfield Feynman diagram technique [11].\nWith the help of the spurion formalism developed in [12] beta-functions for soft supersymmetrybreaking terms can be easily found from the results of [11].\n2\n\nThe situation changes only slightly with variation of tan \u03b2.\n\n4\n\n\f800\n[m], GeV\n\n800\n\nq\u0303L\n\na\ng\u0303\n\n700\nm1/2\nm0\nA0\ntan \u03b2\n\n600\n\n[m], GeV\n\nq\u0303R\n\n= 300 GeV\n= 400 GeV\n=0\n= 50\n\nq\u0303L\n\nb\n\nq\u0303R\n\nt\u03032\n\ng\u0303\n\nb\u03032\nb\u03031\n\n700\n\nt\u03031\n\nm1/2\nm0\nA0\ntan \u03b2\n\n= 300 GeV\n= 400 GeV\n=0\n= 50\n\n500\n \u0303l\n\u03bd\u0303l\n400\n\nH+\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\nt\u03032\nb\u03032\n\nb\u03031\n\u03c7\u030304 , \u03c7\u0303+\n2\n\n600\n\n\u03c7\u030303\nt\u03031\n\nH0 , A0\n300\n\u03c4\u03031\n\n500\n\n\u03c7\u030302 , \u03c7\u0303+\n1\n\n200\n\n \u0303l\nh0\n\n\u03c7\u030304 , \u03c7\u0303+\n2\n\n\u03bd\u0303l\n\n\u03c7\u030301\n\n100\n\n400\n\n\u03bd\u0303\u03c4\n\n\u03c7\u030303\n\nFigure 3: Initial spectrum for SPS4 scenario obtained with original SOFTSUSY code is shown\ntogether with shifts due to calculated two-loop decoupling corrections (a) and three-loop terms\nin RGEs (b). Left plot (a) corresponds to subsequent addition of \u03b4\u03b6mb (green), \u2206mt /mt (blue),\nand \u03b4\u03b6\u03b1s (red) into the code without modification of RGEs. Right plot (b) demonstrates the\nimpact of three-loop RGEs alone (green arrows) and the subsequent inclusion of all the threshold\ncorrections (blue). Corrections that are less than 1% at all the steps are not shown.\nThe first three-loop analysis of the MSSM was performed in [13] and it was found that the\neffect of three-loop running on the SUSY spectrum is small for weakly interacting particles but\nis larger for squark masses (1-5 %). However, two-loop threshold corrections were not available\nat those times. In this talk I will present the results of a more consistent study based on\nmodified version of the SOFTSUSY [14] code3 which takes into account both three-loop RGEs\nand two-loop decoupling corrections discussed earlier.\nAs a benchmark scenario the so-called SPS4 point [15] was chosen. For this point one has\nm0 = 400 GeV, m1/2 = 300 GeV, A0 = 0 at the GUT scale, and tan \u03b2 = 50 at the electroweak\nscale. In order to visualize the impact of additional two-loop terms in decoupling corrections\nand three-loop contributions to beta-functions, the spectrum produced by the SOFTSUSY code\nis presented for four cases.\nIn Fig. 3a one sees how two-loop corrections to b- (green arrows) and t-quark (blue arrows)\nmasses modify the initial spectrum of SPS4 obtained with the original SOFTSUSY 3.1 code.\nQuark Yukawa couplings influence significantly the running of soft masses for the corresponding\nHiggs bosons. This, in turn, leads to the relatively large shifts in the masses of heavy higgses\n(4-5 %) and higgsinos (2-3 %). However, the overall result for heavy higgs masses is small (less\nthan 1 %) due to cancellations. Inclusion of \u03b4 (2) \u03b6\u03b1s (red arrows) slightly lowers the masses of\nthird generation squarks below the initial value.\nThis picture for quark masses and strong coupling was obtained without the inclusion of\nthree-loop terms in RGEs. Figure 3b shows the impact of these additional terms. First of\nall, for comparison with the results of Ref. [13] the spectrum was calculated without two-loop\nthreshold corrections (green arrows). As it was noticed by the previous authors the corrections\ndue to three-loop terms are small and mostly influence strongly interacting particles (by 1-2 %).\nAfter the inclusion of calculated two-loop decoupling corrections one can see additional shifts\nfor squarks, gluino, and neutralino/chargino with large higgsino component. In the end, one\nhas 1-2 % overall correction to the masses of strongly interacting particles and 3 % correction\nto the higgsino masses. It is also interesting to note that the inclusion of three-loop RGEs\n3\n\nAvailable from the author.\n\n5\n\n\flowers the value of the lightest higgs boson mass from 114 GeV down to 113 GeV (not shown\nin Fig. 3b).\n\n4\n\nSummary and Conclusion\n\nSome two-loop threshold corrections to the SM parameters were calculated and numerically\nstudied in a wide region of the parameters space of the MSSM. It turns out that for the\nconsidered region two-loop contributions to the decoupling constants of the strong coupling and\nheavy quark masses are of the order of 2-4 % and do not depend significantly on tan \u03b2. Since\ntau-lepton does not participate in strong interactions, the corresponding correction to its mass\nis smaller than that of quarks. Nevertheless, for large tan \u03b2 it can reach the value of 1 % which\nexceeds current experimental uncertainty of the tau-lepton pole mass.\nA proper way to use the above-mentioned two-loop quantities is to incorporate them together\nwith three-loop RGEs in a code used to calculate the SUSY mass spectrum. For this purpose\nthe SOFTSUSY package has been modified and it was found how the corrections influence the\nspectrum. A numerical study was performed for a particular scenario SPS4 with large tan \u03b2\nfor which certain decoupling corrections are expected to be large. The overall effect of the\nthree-loop running on the mass spectrum turns out to be small and does not exceed a few per\ncent. In comparison with previous studies it was found that the inclusion of the decoupling\ncorrections besides lowering squark masses leads to a decrease in gluino and higgsino masses.\n450\n\n3-loop\n2-loop\nEGRET point\n\n400\n\nm1/2, GeV\n\n350\nA0 = 0, tan \u03b2 = 50\n\n300\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n800\n\n1000\n\n1200\n\n1400\nm0, GeV\n\n1600\n\n1800\n\n2000\n\nFigure 4: Forbidden regions in the m0 \u2212 m1/2 plane where no EWSB occurs. The green region\nwas obtained with the help of two-loop RGEs and the red one - with three-loop terms. It is\nclear that the so-called EGRET [16] point is not allowed by three-loop analysis.\nIt is also interesting to study the influence on allowed regions in the parameter space.\nFor example, the boundary that separates the regions with and without electroweak symmetry\nbreaking (EWSB) can be significantly shifted. Figure 4 shows how the forbidden region increases\nafter taking into account three-loop RGEs and the corresponding threshold effects. The so-called\n\"EGRET point\" proposed in [16] is also shown and it looks like three-loop evolution excludes it.\nTherefore, one should be careful when choosing particular values of parameters near boundaries\nof the allowed region.\n\n6\n\n\fMoreover, although being small the calculated corrections give us an opportunity to estimate\ntheoretical uncertainties of the SUSY parameters fitted with the help of two-loop RGEs. This\nseems to be more reliable than (or at least complementary to) the comparison between the\nresults of different computer codes.\nAt the end, I would like to thank the organizers of the \"Quarks 2010\" seminar for the\nopportunity to participate in such a nice event.
