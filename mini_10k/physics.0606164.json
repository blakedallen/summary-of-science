Though the influence of the trading frequency\non the aggregate return in a certain time interval is important, it cannot alone explain the heavy\ntailed distribution of stock price changes. For this reason, we analyze intervals with a fixed number\nof trades in order to eliminate the influence of the trading frequency and investigate the relevance of\nother factors for the aggregate return. We show that in tick time the price follows a discrete diffusion\nprocess with a variable step width while the difference between the number of steps in positive and\nnegative direction in an interval is Gaussian distributed. The step width is given by the return due\nto a single trade and is long-term correlated in tick time. Hence, its mean value can well characterize\nan interval of many trades and turns out to be an important determinant for large aggregate returns.\nWe also present a statistical model reproducing the cumulative distribution of aggregate returns.\nFor an accurate agreement with the empirical distribution, we also take into account asymmetries\nof the step widths in different directions together with crosscorrelations between these asymmetries\nand the mean step width as well as the signs of the steps.\n\nThe mechanics of stock price changes were studied already more than a hundred years ago, when Bachelier\nmodelled price movements as a diffusion process with\nGaussian fluctuations [1]. However, empirical studies\nshow that the distribution of returns has heavy tails\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], meaning that events\nwith large price changes are much more probable than\nin a Gaussian distribution. In addition, the functional\nform of the distribution stays similar if the return is aggregated on very different time scales from seconds to\nmonths, approximating a Gaussian distribution only if\nthe time scale becomes very large [2, 3].\nThese findings would suggest that stock returns have a\nL\u00e9vy stable distribution [2, 13, 14, 15]. In a L\u00e9vy flight,\nthe second moment would be divergent and extreme returns aggregated over a long time would be determined\nby very large price jumps on smaller time scales. However, empirical studies find evidence that the tail of the\nreturn distribution follows a power law with exponent\naround \u03b1\u22121 = 3 so that it does not agree with the stable\nParetian hypothesis [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].\nThe cause of the fat tails is currently a subject of great\ninterest [22, 23, 24, 25, 26]. Farmer et al. find that\nthe distribution of returns due to a single trade (tick returns) is similar to the distribution of returns aggregated\non longer time scales with the same tail exponent [25].\nAlthough the tail exponent is outside the L\u00e9vy regime\n0 < \u03b1 \u2212 1 < 2, they argue that similar to a L\u00e9vy flight\nboth distributions are caused by the same microscopic\nmechanism, so that large aggregate returns are due to\nsingle exceptionally large tick returns. Plerou et al. describe the price movements as a diffusion process with a\nfluctuating diffusion constant and relate the distribution\nof aggregate returns to the distribution of the variance of\nthe tick returns [26].\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: pw@thp.uni-koeln.de\n\nIn the present paper, we investigate the transition from\ntick returns to returns aggregated in intervals with a\nlarger number of trades. It is well documented (e.g. in\n[27, 28]) that the number of trades in a time interval is\nan important determinant of the aggregate return. However, the trading frequency alone cannot account for the\nobserved fat tailed distribution of aggregate returns [26].\nThus, we remove the direct influence of the trading frequency by analyzing intervals with a constant number of\ntrades so that effects due to other quantities like the tick\nreturn size are more clearly visible.\nWe study how each aggregate return is actually built\nfrom the basic quantities involved in the process, and\nthus examine the mechanism leading to large price fluctuations. According to the central limit theorem, independent tick returns would in aggregation lead to Gaussian distributed returns. However, we find that the tick\nreturn size is long-term correlated in tick time (compare [29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]), so that the\nconditions of the central limit theorem are not fulfilled.\nThus, the mean tick return size can well characterize an\ninterval of many trades and its fluctuations lead to the\nnon-Gaussian behavior of the aggregate return. In this\npicture, large aggregate returns do not occur because of a\nfew very large tick returns, but rather when the average\ntick return is large, so that even Gaussian fluctuations in\nthe direction of the trades can lead to aggregate return\nlarger than in a Gaussian distribution.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows:\nsection I shows our model for the price diffusion process, in section II we describe the data set used for this\nstudy, section III shows the influence of the tick return\nsize on the aggregate return while section IV focusses on\nthe influence of differences in the direction of tick returns\n(number difference). Section V compares the number difference and the flow of market orders and in section VI\nwe present a statistical model which approximates the\ndistribution of aggregate returns. We conclude with a\ndiscussion of our results in section VII.\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe study intervals with a fixed number of N = 100\ntrades. If the price of a stock before the i-th trade is si ,\nwe define the return due to a single trade, the tick return,\nas\n\u03b4gi = ln(si+1 ) \u2212 ln(si ) .\n\n(1)\n\nThe interval Ij contains all N trades with index i between jN and (j + 1)N , so the aggregate return Gj is\ngiven by the sum over all \u03b4gi with i\u01ebIj :\nX\nGj =\n\u03b4gi .\n(2)\ni\u01ebIj\n\nX\ni\u01ebIj ,i6=i0\n\n.\n\u03b4gi \u2248 \u03b4gimax\n0\n\n(3)\n\nis exceptionally large.\nThus, Gj becomes large if \u03b4gimax\n0\nIn the second case, we assume that there is no extremely large tick return dominating the aggregate return, so that we focus on the average size \u2206gj of the\nnon-zero tick returns, which is defined by\n\u2206gj =\n\n1\nnj\n\nGj = \u2206gj \u2206Nj +\n\nX\n\u03b4gi 6=0,i\u01ebIj\n\n|\u03b4gi |\n\n(4)\n\nHere, nj is the number of \u03b4gi 6= 0 in the interval Ij .\nNeglecting assymetries in the \u03b4gi , we can replace all \u03b4gi 6=\n0 by sign(\u03b4gi )\u2206gj and approximate the aggregate return\nby\nX\nGj \u2248 \u2206gj\nsign(\u03b4gi ) = \u2206gj \u2206Nj\n(5)\n\u03b4gi 6=0,i\u01ebIj\n\nP\nwhere \u2206Nj = \u03b4gi 6=0,i\u01ebIj sign(\u03b4gi ) is called number difference. Similarly, Gj can be described as a diffusion\nprocess with\nG2j \u2248 Dj N\n\n(6)\nn\n\nwhere the diffusion constant Dj = Nj \u2206gj2 varies due to\nthe varying step width \u2206gj and the number nj of nonzero tick returns.\nIn the approximation given by Eq. 5, we can study the\ninfluence of the mean size of the tick returns as well as\nasymmetries in their direction. A large aggregate return\ncan occur if the price moves more often in one direction\nthan in the other. Thus, with large temporary correlations between the signs, even small tick returns could\ncompose a large Gj . On the other hand, if \u2206gj is larger,\neven a small asymmetry in the signs can lead to a large\nreturn.\n\n\u2212\n2n+\nj nj\n(\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 )\nnj\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u2206gj+ and \u2206gj\u2212 are the average tick returns in posi\u2212\ntive and negative direction while n+\nj and nj are the numbers of non-negative tick returns in positive and negative\ndirection.\n\nII.\n\nWe want to discuss two special cases in order to analyze the mechanism leading to large aggregate returns\nGj . In the first case, Gj is dominated by one (or a few)\n, so that\nextremely large \u03b4gimax\n0\n+\nGj = \u03b4gimax\n0\n\nThe two approximations given in Eq. 3 and Eq. 5 are\nanalyzed in sections III and IV of this paper, but in section VI we also consider the error term neglected in Eq. 5.\nAn exact formulation writes\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n\nWe analyzed order book data of the year 2002 from Island ECN for the ten most frequently traded stocks [38].\nSince the Island ECN is a secondary market where only\npart of the whole stock volume is traded, we also studied\nthe index fund QQQ which was mainly traded via Island\nuntil September 2002. Since our results for the ten stocks\nand QQQ are similar, we find no evidence that secondary\nmarket characteristics of Island affect our analysis negatively.\nIn an electronic market place like Island, people can\nplace limit orders to buy or to sell at a given or better\nprice (limit price), which is specified in the order. These\norders are stored in the order book and they are only\nexecuted when the actual stock price reaches the limit\nprice. A trade is initiated by a market order indicating\nthat someone wants to buy or sell immediately at the\nbest available price. Such a market order executes the\nlimit orders offering the best prices until the number of\nshares specified in the market order is traded.\nOur dataset contains information about every limit order so that we are able to reproduce the market situation\nat each instant of time. We combine those limit order\nexecutions with identical time stamps as they reflect the\nsame market order. Therefore, we can analyze the impact\nof each single market order on the price. In this analysis,\nthe price is defined as the mid-quote price which is the\nmean of the best available buy (bid) and sell (ask) limit\nprices (quotes). We study intervals with a fixed number of N = 100 market orders and have approximately\n100,000 intervals in our dataset for ten stocks. Thus,\non average a 100 trade interval corresponds to about 10\nminutes, but the trading frequency fluctuates strongly\nso that 100 trades can correspond to time intervals with\nvery different lengths.\nWe determine the mid-quote price si just before the\nexecution of the i-th market order. Since most trades\nchange the price just by the size of the gap between the\nbest and the second best limit price [25], the tick return \u03b4gi corresponds to the gap size. We note that the\nprice can (and often does) change between two consecutive market orders due to placement or cancellation of\nlimit orders so that \u03b4gi does not provide a direct estimate\n\n\f3\n8\n\n1\n(a)\n\n0.8\nmax+\n\n\u03b4gj\n\n0.6\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\n5\n\n0.2\n\n|Gj| 4\n\n0\n\n3\n(b)\n\n0.8\nmax\u03b4gj\n\n7\n\n2\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\n0\n\n50000\nrank\n\n100000\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Five largest price changes (a) \u03b4gjmax+\nand (b) \u03b4gjmax\u2212 due to a single trade with (a) the same and\n(b) the opposite sign as the aggregate return in that 100 tick\ninterval, plotted against the rank of the corresponding aggregate return |Gj | for the combined data of ten Nasdaq stocks\nin 2002 (smoothed by averaging over 100 intervals).

To this end, we\nstart with the approximation shown in Eq. 3 where a\nfew extremely large tick returns (corresponding to some\nvery large gaps in the order book) lead to a very large\naggregate return Gj . In order to test this hypothesis,\nwe analyzed the five largest tick returns \u03b4gjmax+ with the\nsame sign as the aggregate return Gj (i.e. the five largest\npositive \u03b4gi if Gj > 0 and the five largest negative \u03b4gi for\nGj < 0) in each time interval. To this end, we sort the\nintervals by |Gj | and plot the \u03b4gjmax+ against the rank\nof the interval according to its return |Gj |.\nFig. 1(a) shows the values of these \u03b4gjmax+ in intervals with small Gj \u2248 0 on the left while the values for\nlarge returns exceeding five standard deviations can be\nfound on the right.

When aggregated, these five largest \u03b4gjmax+ can reach about three\nstandard deviations, which is almost half of the largest\naggregate returns.\nIn Fig. 1(b), we plot the five largest tick returns\n\u03b4gjmax\u2212 with the opposite direction as the aggregate return against their rank. The \u03b4gjmax\u2212 behave similarly\nto the \u03b4gjmax+ , though the increase for large aggregate\nreturns is slightly weaker. However, even for the largest\naggregate returns the difference between the \u03b4gjmax+ and\n\u03b4gjmax\u2212 is rather small, so that there are also large tick\nreturns reducing the aggregate return.\nOur results suggest that large aggregate returns are not\nthe result of single exceptionally large tick returns since\nvery large tick returns occur in both directions and cancel\neach other out. In the following, we want to focus not\non the extreme tick returns, but on the influence of their\nmean value. More precisely, we analyze Eq. 5 and the\nmean tick return \u2206gj of all non-zero |\u03b4gi | in the interval\nIj as defined in Eq. 4. A density plot of |Gj | against \u2206gj\nis shown in Fig. 2. It seems that extremely large returns\nGj correspond to larger average tick returns \u2206gj , but the\nbroad distribution suggests that the explanatory power\nof \u2206gj alone for the aggregate return Gj is small, which\nis confirmed by the low correlation coefficient R2 = 0.07\nof a linear regression.\nIn order to clarify the relation between the extreme\nvalues of |Gj | and \u2206gj , we sort the intervals by |Gj |\nand plot \u2206gj against the rank of the interval according\nto its return |Gj |. In Fig. 3 (black curve), we see that\nlarge returns |Gj | coincide with larger tick returns as \u2206gj\nchanges by a factor of two from very low aggregate re-\n\n\f4\n0.2\n\n0.15\n\n\u2206gj\n\nautocorrelation of |\u03b4gi|\n\nempirical data\nempirical data (shuffled)\nsimulation\n\n0.1\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50000\n\n100000\n\nrank\nFIG. 3: (Color online) Black curve: average tick return \u2206gj\nof ten Nasdaq stocks plotted against the rank of the corresponding aggregate return |Gj |, smoothed by averaging over\n100 intervals. Going from the smallest returns |Gj | \u2248 0 to\nreturns larger than 5 standard deviations, \u2206gj increases by a\nfactor of two. Light grey curve: after shuffling the tick returns\nfor each stock, the same curve is only slightly increased for\nthe largest aggregate returns, the effect is much smaller than\nfor the original data. Blue curve (or dark grey): the simulation according to the statistical model discussed in section\nVI shows a similar behaviour as the empirical data, but in\nthe simulation \u2206gj is a little larger than the empirical one\nexcept for the largest |Gj | where the simulated \u2206gj is slightly\nsmaller than the empirical one.\n\nturns to large returns of several standard deviations. In\ncomparison with the largest tick returns \u03b4gjmax+ shown\nin Fig. 1, the change of a factor of two is similar, but the\nmean \u2206gj is two to four times smaller than the largest\ntick returns.\nThis finding can be explained by the presence of autocorrelations in the time series of \u03b4gi , which can be illustrated when we shuffle the data for each stock by exchanging each tick return with another randomly chosen\ntick return. The light grey curve in Fig. 3 shows that for\nshuffled data \u2206gj increases only marginally for large aggregate returns, suggesting that autocorrelations of the\ntick returns have a strong influence on the mean tick return size \u2206gj . Indeed, we find that the absolute values\n|\u03b4gi | of the tick return are long-range correlated in tick\ntime with a correlation function decaying like \u2206i\u22120.16 for\nlarge time lags \u2206i = |i1 \u2212 i2 |, as shown in Fig. 4. If these\ncorrelations are destroyed by shuffling, in each interval of\n100 trades only a few large tick returns remain so that\nthe average over these 100 tick returns approximates the\nglobal mean of all tick returns in the data set.\nIn contrast, in the empirical unshuffled data correlations lead to intervals where many tick returns are large,\nso that the average tick return size is also large. The\naverage tick return size \u2206gj can well characterize the interval only because these autocorrelations exist. It turns\nout that the increase of \u2206gj by a factor of two is the\nmain effect where the original empirical data deviates\nsignificantly from shuffled data. Hence, we suggest that\n\n0.1\n\n-0.16\n\n~x\n\n0.02\n\n1\n\n10\n100\ntime lag [tick time]\n\n1000\n\nFIG. 4: Autocorrelation function of the absolute value of the\ntick return |\u03b4gi | averaged over the data of ten Nasdaq stocks\nin 2002. The function shows a power law decay in tick time\nproportional to \u2206i\u22120.16 for large \u2206i.\n\nfluctuations of the tick return size are responsible for the\nnon-Gaussian fluctuations of the aggregate return.\nUsing Eq. 5, we can estimate whether the change by a\nfactor of two of the average tick return alone is enough\nto explain large aggregate returns Gj of more than five\nstandard deviations. To this end, we focus on the intervals with the 50 largest aggregate returns ranging from\napproximately 4 to almost 8 standard deviations. Here,\nwe find that \u2206gj fluctuates between 0.14 and 0.35. Assuming\nuncorrelated returns, \u2206Nj should be of the order\n\u221a\nN \u2248 10 if each trade would lead to a price change, but\nnormal\n\u221a fluctuations could well lead to \u2206Nj twice as large\nas N , so that large tick returns together with fluctuations in the number difference could explain the large\naggregate returns we find in our data set.\nThus, we find that in intervals with 100 trades large\n|Gj | do not mainly depend on single extremely large tick\nreturns. It rather turns out that correlations between the\ntick returns lead to large average tick returns \u2206gj in an\ninterval, and the fluctuations of \u2206gj can account for the\nnon-Gaussian distribution of the aggregate returns.\nIV.\n\nNUMBER DIFFERENCE\n\nThe diffusion process of aggregate returns is not only\ninfluenced by the step width (i.e. the tick return size),\nbut also by the direction of the steps. Therefore, we now\nanalyze the influence of the number difference \u2206Nj in\nEq. 5. In order to treat positive and negative aggregate\nreturns in the same analysis, it is useful to replace \u2206Nj\nby the sign-adapted number difference\n\u2206nj = sign(Gj )\u2206Nj .\n\n(8)\n\nA positive value of \u2206nj indicates that the price tends to\nmove in one specific direction leading to an aggregate return with the same sign. \u2206nj can be negative if there are\n\n\f5\n8\n\n20\n\n7\n\nempirical data\nempirical data (shuffled)\nsimulation\n\nnumber of events (color coded)\n15\n\n6\n5\n\n\u2206nj 10\n\n|Gj| 4\n3\n\n5\n\n2\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n-20\n\n0\n\n\u2206nj\n\n20\n\n40\n\nFIG. 5: Density plot of the aggregate return |Gj | against the\ndifference \u2206nj between the number of tick returns with the\nsame and with the opposite direction as the aggregate return,\nfor ten Nasdaq stocks. The points are coded from light grey\nto black indicating the number of events from 1 to more than\n600. A linear regression has a large correlation coefficient\nR2 = 0.32.\n\na few large tick returns determining the direction of the\naggregate return, but also many small tick returns with\nthe opposite direction which do not affect the aggregate\nreturn very much. Fig. 5 shows a density plot of the\naggregate return |Gj | against the sign-adapted number\ndifference \u2206nj . A linear regression yields an R2 of 0.32,\na large correlation coefficient confirming the visual impression that \u2206nj and |Gj | are strongly connected. We\ncan also see that \u2206nj is mostly positive for large returns\nGj , so that each large price change is accompanied by a\ncertain sign-adapted number difference \u2206nj .\nWe now plot in Fig. 6 \u2206nj against the rank according\nto |Gj |. We find that except for the largest (approximately 15%) of the aggregate returns, \u2206nj grows linearly\nwith the rank while in Fig. 3 \u2206gj remained almost constant in that region. For the largest ranks, \u2206n increases\nmore rapidly, so that all in all the smoothed curve (averaged over 100 intervals) grows from 0 to 18 between very\nsmall and extremely large aggregate returns. Thus, in intervals with very large returns there are approximately 18\ntrades pushing the price in one direction (assuming that\nall other trades cancel each other out), so that even with\nrather small tick returns this can lead to large returns in\naggregation. Focusing on the 50 largest Gj , we find that\n\u2206nj ranges from 4 to 41, clearly above the expected standard deviation of 10 when assuming uncorrelated returns\nand nj = N .\nThus, the fluctuations of \u2206nj around the mean value\nare crucial for getting large aggregate returns. The number difference seems to be the main mechanism affecting\nthe aggregate return since it changes much more drastically than the tick return size when the aggregate return\nincreases. On the other hand, when we compare the re-\n\n0\n\n50000\n\n100000\n\nrank\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Black curve: the sign-adapted number\ndifference \u2206nj is plotted against the rank according to the\naggregate return |Gj | for 10 Nasdaq stocks, smoothed by averaging over 100 intervals. \u2206nj grows from zero to 18. The\nrelation between \u2206nj and the rank seems to be linear except\nfor the largest 15% of the aggregate returns. A simulation\n(blue curve (or dark grey)) using a normal distribution for\n\u2206Nj leads to nearly the same dependance on the rank. For\nshuffled data (light grey curve), the curve is slightly flatter,\nbut the difference is not large.\n\nsults to the analysis with shuffled data (light grey curve\nin Fig. 6), it turns out that this effect is very similar to\nwhat happens with random price changes. Hence, the\nbasic movement of the aggregate return seems to depend\nmostly on the number difference, but the non-Gaussian\nlarge aggregate price changes only occur if the tick returns are large.\n\nV.\n\nMARKET ORDER SIGNS AND DIRECTION\nOF TICK RETURNS\n\nIt is known that the signs of market orders are strongly\ncorrelated [39, 40] which means that there is a large probability that a buy market order will be followed by another buy market order. Thus, it is probable that large\nnumber differences in the direction of tick returns are\ncaused by large numbers of equally signed market orders. In order to analyze the relation between the number difference and the market order flow, we define the\nm+\ndifference \u2206nm\nof market orj between the number nj\nders with the same direction as Gj and the market orders\nwith opposite direction nm\u2212\n:\nj\nm+\n\u2206nm\n\u2212 nm\u2212\n.\nj = nj\nj\n\n(9)\n\nIn Fig. 7 we plot the sign-adapted number difference\n\u2206nj against the market order difference \u2206nm\nj . We find a\nstrong correlation between \u2206nj and \u2206nm\nj , a linear regression yields a correlation coefficient R2 of 0.29.

The correlation\ncoefficient of a linear regression yields R2 = 0.29, thus there\nis a strong connection between the two quantities. On the\nother hand, the events scatter widely so that small \u2206n are\noften linked with large \u2206nm\nj and vice versa.\n\nthere are also large fluctuations suggesting that the number difference is also due to order book dynamics, namely\nlimit order placement and cancellation as well as asymmetries in the order book. A model for price formation\ndue to these quantities was recently proposed by Mike\nand Farmer [41].\n\nVI. DISTRIBUTION OF AGGREGATE\nRETURNS AND A STATISTICAL MODEL\n\nIn the first part of this paper, we analyzed the mechanism leading to large aggregate returns and showed\nthat the varying step width \u2206gj accounts for the nonGaussian behavior of the diffusion process of price movements. Now we want to use our results in a statistical\nmodel and reproduce the cumulative distribution function of the absolute value of the aggregate return |Gj |.\nThe model given by Eq. 5 belongs to the well-known\nclass of stochastic volatility models (see e.g. [42]) consisting of a noise term multiplied by a time-dependent\nvolatility giving the magnitude of the fluctuations. In\nthe present paper, the model is based on a microscopic\ndescription of the price process, so that we can fit the\nmicroscopic quantities determining the aggregate return\nin order to estimate the parameters of the model. In this\napproach the model is parameter-free in the sense that\nthere are no parameters fitting the aggregate returns directly, though we fit the distributions of its determinants\nlike the step width \u2206gj and the number difference \u2206Nj .\nWe also discuss corrections to the model by including the\ntick return asymmetries according to Eq. 7.\nWe first analyze the distributions of \u2206gj and \u2206Nj .\n\nP(\u2206Nj)\n\n-50\n\n0.5\n\n(b)\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nempirical data\nsimulation\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-40\n\ncumulative distribution\n\n-100\n\n0.4\n\n\u2206gj\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n\u2206Nj\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n(c)\n\nempirical data positive values\nempirical data negative values\nfit to empirical data\nsimulation\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10 0\n\n0.1\n\n+\n\n-\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206gj - \u2206gj\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Estimation of the parameters for\nthe simulation (results shown as dotted lines) from empirical data for ten Nasdaq stocks.

(c) As a rough approximation, the average of the cumulative distribution of the positive (line) and\nnegative (dashed line) values of \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 are parameterized proportional to two exponential functions e\u2212a1,2 x/\u2206\u1e21 for\n|\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 | \u2276 0.1, with a1 = 8.0 and a2 = 4.8 (dashdotted\nline). The simulation (dotted line) uses the adapted a1 = 9.0\nand a2 = 2.0 in order to compensate the change in the distribution after taking into account \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N .\nj\n\nj\n\nFig. 8(a) shows the cumulative distribution of \u2206gj in a\nlog-linear plot.

A simulation\nof Eq. 5 (triangles) leads to a reasonable approximation of the\nempirical data, but it overestimates the probability of large\nreturns. It becomes a little broader if we add the tick return\nasymmetry \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 according to Eq. 7 and simulate independent quantities (diamonds). The simulation (squares)\nmatches the empirical data very well if we incorporate correlations by generating \u2206gj+ \u2212\u2206gj\u2212 according to the conditional\nexpectation value \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N .\nj\n\nj\n\nstocks lead to a plateau. In section IV we already found\nevidence that \u2206Nj behaves similarly to uncorrelated data\nsince in Fig. 6 the shuffled data shows almost the same\ndependence on the rank of the corresponding |Gj |. Figure\n8(b) shows that indeed \u2206Nj can be well described by a\nGaussian noise with mean 0.24 and standard deviation\n9.0.\nIn order to analyze the accuracy of the approximation\ngiven in Eq. 5, we simulate two independent time series\naccording to the fitted functions for \u2206gj and \u2206Nj and\nbuild the aggregate return Gj as the product of \u2206gj and\n\u2206Nj . In Figure 9 we can compare the empirically found\ncumulative distribution of aggregate returns |Gj | (circles)\nto the results of this simulation (triangles). The simulation of Eq. 5 leads to a reasonable agreement with the\nactual aggregate return, but it overestimates the probability of large aggregate returns. We note that the parameters of the simulation are completely determined by\nthe empirically found distributions of \u2206gj and \u2206Nj , so\nthat in this sense the simulation of |Gj | has no free parameters.\nIn the following, we want to address the remaining deviations of the simulation from the empirical data. Eq. 7\ngives an exact formula for Gj and provides a good parameterization for the error term which reads\nGj \u2212 \u2206gj \u2206Nj =\n\n\u2212\n2n+\nj nj\n(\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 )\nnj\n\n(10)\n\n\u2212\nWe find that the term 2n+\nj nj /nj has no systematic in-\n\nfluence on the aggregate return since it shows almost no\ndependence on the rank according to the aggregate return. In the following, we thus approximate it by its av\u2212\nerage value 2n+\nj nj /nj = 28.7, so that the error term is\ndetermined by the asymmetries \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 in the mean\ntick return size.\nThe cumulative distribution of \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 is shown\nin Fig. 8(c). The main part of the distribution could be\nwell fitted by an exponential function, but in the tail the\ndistribution becomes broader. Thus, we add the term\nwith \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 to our simulation by creating a third\nindependent time series according to the empirical distribution of \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 . Fig. 9 (diamonds) shows that this\nleads to an even broader distribution of the aggregate return. Since the difference to the distribution according\nto Eq. 5 is small, the tick return asymmetry seems to\nhave only a small influence on the aggregate return.\nA more accurate agreement with the empirical data\ncan be obtained by taking into account correlations between the quantities involved in the process. The correlation coefficients between them are shown in the following\ntable where the correlations between the absolute values\nare shown in brackets:\n\n\u2206Nj\n\u2206gj\n\u2206Nj\n\n\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212\n\n\u2206gj \u2206Nj\n\n-0.02 (-0.07) -0.01 (0.37) -0.01 (0.34)\n1\n\n-0.35 (0.01) 0.95 (0.87)\n\n\u2206gj \u2206Nj 0.95 (0.87) -0.41 (0.02)\n\n1\n\n\u2206gj and |\u2206Nj | show slightly negative correlations which\nmight suggest that people act more cautiously when large\ntick returns indicate a low liquidity. In these times,\ntraders try not to place too many consecutive orders with\nthe same sign because they know that it could lead to\na large price change and increased trading costs. Furthermore, the strong anti-correlations between \u2206Nj and\n\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 also indicate cautious traders: If there are\nlarge asymmetries, so that e.g. the positive tick returns\nare much larger than the negative ones, people tend to\nuse the higher liquidity in negative direction so that in\nthese times they sell more often than they buy. For an\nanalysis of the relation between liquidity imbalance and\nmarket efficiency, see e.g. [43]. The large correlations\nbetween \u2206gj and |\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 | show that we can expect\nlarge variations of the tick return in positive and negative\ndirection when the tick return is in general large.\nWe now want to incorporate correlations in our simulation. The strongest non-trivial correlations appear between \u2206gj \u2206Nj and \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 including also some of\nthe correlations between \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 and \u2206gj as well as\n\u2206Nj . However, it turns out that the conditional expectation value \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N is non-linear, as seen\nj\n\nj\n\nin Fig. 10 (circles) where it is plotted against \u2206gj \u2206Nj .\n\n\f8\n0.2\nempirical data\n1.59\n\n0.1\n\n-\n\nj\n\n<\u2206gj - \u2206gj >\u2206g \u2206N\n\nj\n\nfit leading to - 0.0057 sgn(x) x\n\n+\n\n0\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.2\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n\u2206gj\u2206Nj\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nFIG. 10: (Color online) Conditional expectation value\n\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N plotted against \u2206gj \u2206Nj (circles), obj\nj\ntained from the data of 10 Nasdaq stocks.\nA fit\n+\nleads to \u2206gj \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N \u2248 \u22120.0057 * sgn(\u2206gj \u2206Nj ) *\nj\n\nj\n\n(\u2206gj \u2206Nj )1.59 (dashed line).

Using the conditional expectation value in the\nsimulation incorporates these correlations which allows for the\nreproduction of the distribution of aggregate returns.\n\nThe function can be well fitted by \u2212sgn(x)\u03b1|x|\u03b2 with\n\u03b1 = 0.0057 and \u03b2 = 1.59 (dashed line).\nIn order to incorporate this conditional expectation\nvalue into the simulation, we first create three independent time series for \u2206gj , \u2206Nj , and \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 .\nThen, for each j we add the conditional expectation value\n\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N to \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 , according to the\nj\nj\nvalue of \u2206gj \u2206Nj for that j. This method leads to a different distribution for \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 than the initial one,\nso that we can not anymore generate \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 from\nthe unconditional empirical distribution. As a rough approximation, we parameterize this distribution by two\nexponential functions e\u2212a1,2 x/\u2206\u1e21 for \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2276 0.1.\nThen, we adapt the factors in the exponent in such a\nway that the resulting unconditional distribution fits the\nempirical one (a fit to the empirical distribution yields\na1 = 8.0 and a2 = 4.8, for the simulation we use the\nadapted a1 = 9.0 and a2 = 2.0, compare Fig. 8(c)). The\nresulting distribution of Gj does not depend very much\non the exact values of a1,2 .\nThe effect of the correlations represented by the conditional expectation value \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N is very\nj\n\nj\n\nlarge and leads to a cumulative distribution of |Gj |\n(squares in Fig. 9) very similar to the empirical one (circles). It is worth noting that now the largest events are\nnot anymore necessarily the ones with the largest values\nof \u2206gj \u2206Nj . Due to the anti-correlations expressed in\n\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 \u2206g \u2206N , very large values of \u2206gj \u2206Nj can\nj\n\nj\n\nposite sign reducing the aggregate return.\nIn addition to the distribution of the aggregate return,\nthe simulation does also agree with other properties of\nthe empirical data we found earlier in this paper. In\nFig. 3 and 6 we also plotted the data from the simulation\nagainst the rank according to the aggregate return |Gj |.\nFor \u2206Nj the simulation matches the empirical data very\nwell, while in Figure 3 we see that the simulated \u2206gj\nshows the same dependence on the rank as the empirical\ndata, but it is generally a little larger than the real one\nexcept for the largest aggregate returns, which might be\ndue to the cutoff around 0.094 we used in the simulation\nof the distribution of \u2206gj . We also find that the role of\n\u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 in determining large aggregate returns is a\nlittle overestimated by our simulation, but the simulation\ncovers the main features of the empirical data although\nwe neglected many of the subtle relations between the\ndifferent quantities.\n\nlead to relatively large values of \u2206gj+ \u2212 \u2206gj\u2212 of the op-\n\nVII.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nOur results can be divided into two parts: First, we\nshowed that the movement of stock prices in intervals\nwith a constant number of trades can be understood as a\ndiffusion process with a varying step width. Here, Gaussian fluctuations of the number difference determine the\nbasic price movement, but the non-Gaussian large price\nchanges are due to changes in the tick return size coinciding with large number differences at the same time.\nThe large influence of the tick return size is caused by its\nautocorrelations assuring that in a 100 tick interval one\ncan find many large tick returns so that the mean value of\nthe tick return can be large. In such intervals, the price\nchange in response to a trade is large, which is referred\nto as a period of low liquidity. Thus, the diffusion process of stock returns depends largely on fluctuations in\nthe liquidity, in agreement with the findings of previous\nworks [23, 24, 25, 26].\nIn the second part of this paper, we found that the distribution of aggregate returns can be reasonably approximated by simulating the microscopic quantities mean tick\nreturn size and number difference according to their empirically found distributions. A more accurate agreement\ncan be obtained by taking into account asymmetries in\nthe tick return size in positive and negative direction as\nwell as correlations between the different quantities.\nTo conclude, we found evidence that price fluctuations\nin intervals with a constant number of trades can be described by a diffusion process with a varying step width.\nThe long-term autocorrelations in the tick return size\nmake sure that periods of low liquidity, where the price\nchange due to a trade is large, last long enough to cause\nlarge aggregate returns in intervals with many trades.\nOur results suggests that the power law distribution of\naggregate returns might not be universal but rather depends on a more complicated mechanism which is a combination of the dynamics of the trading frequency, the\n\n\f9\ndynamics of the step width and the Gaussian process of\nthe step direction.\n\nsions, and a critical reading of the manuscript.
