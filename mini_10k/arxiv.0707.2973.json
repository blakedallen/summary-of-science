We\nargue that important contributions may come from phase space regions where three heavy fermions\nare separated by relative velocities much lower than the speed of light, and to which standard\neffective field theories do not apply. In this region, infrared sensitive color exchange is specific to the\npresence of the unpaired (anti)quark. This effect vanishes as the motion of the additional particle\nbecomes relativistic with respect to the pair, and is completely absent for massless quarks and gluons\nin the final state.\n\nIn heavy-quarkonium production, the formation of\nthe heavy-quark pair can be perturbative. The subsequent evolution of the quark pair is conventionally\ntreated in the language of effective theories, most notably non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) [1]. In NRQCD,\nnon-perturbative dynamics is organized through a factorization characterized by a joint expansion in the strong\ncoupling, \u03b1s and v, the relative velocity. This expansion\nis well-justified for heavy-quarkonium decays, although it\nstill lacks a compelling proof for production processes. It\nis clear, however, that NRQCD cannot apply directly to\nreactions in which three heavy particles, two quarks and\nan antiquark for example, are produced close together in\nphase space, simply because there is no unique choice of\nrelative velocity v.\nAlthough the application of NRQCD to production\nprocesses has had many successes [2, 3], there remain\nwell-known data anomalies, particularly in connection\nwith the polarization observations at the Tevatron [4]\nand the size of the associated production cross section\nfor J/\u03c8 with cc\u0304 pairs, as seen by the BELLE and Babar\ncollaborations [5]. Regarding the latter, the rate for J/\u03c8\nassociated production is unexpectedly large compared to\nJ/\u03c8 with light hadrons. The importance of associated\nproduction within the formalism of NRQCD has recently\nbeen explored at leading order (LO) for hadroproduction in Ref. [6] and at next-to-leading order (NLO) for\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation in Ref. [7]. We will see, however, that\nNRQCD may not be the complete story for these processes.\nAssociated pair production for J/\u03c8 and related\nquarkonium states provides access to a novel kinematic\nregion, where the heavy quarkonium is produced close\nin phase space to open heavy flavor. The presence of\nthe additional quark, itself a source of color, could influence hadronization. In addition, studying this configuration sheds light on NRQCD factorization [8] for processes\nwithout associated heavy quark pairs, and we will make\ncontact with our previous work on that important question [9, 10]. We begin with a discussion of matching and\ninfrared poles in dimensional regularization for NLO corrections to associated production of heavy quarks Q, of\nmass m, in e+ e\u2212 annihilation.\n\nP1\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP2\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\nP3\n\n=\n\n+\nP4\n\nP4\n\nP3\n\nP1\nP2\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n+ ***\nP3\nP4\n\nFIG. 1: Representative lowest order diagrams for a virtual\nphoton decaying into two heavy quark pairs, for fixed quark\nmomentum P1 and antiquark momentum P2 . The pair P1\nand P2 will be associated with a bound state.\n\nDiagrams for e+ e\u2212 \u2192 QQ\u0304 + QQ\u0304 are shown in Fig. 1.\nBecause we will study final states with two pairs, we will\nfind it useful to refer to the pair that forms the bound\nstate as the \"active\" pair. To be specific, we will denote\nthe quark and antiquark momenta of the active pair as\nP1 and P2 , respectively, with total and relative momenta\nand rest-frame relative velocity given by\nP1 =\n\n4m2\nP\n~q 2\nP\n+ q, P2 =\n\u2212 q, v 2 = \u22172 = 1 \u2212 2 , (1)\n2\n2\nE\nP\n\nwhere 2E \u2217 is the total center of mass energy of the active\npair, and where in the second expression for v 2 we give\nthe invariant form. In the diagrams of Fig. 1, we refer to\nthe additional heavy particle that is closest in phase space\nto the active pair as the \"spectator\" quark (or antiquark).\nThe LO NRQCD cross sections for the amplitudes of\nFig. 1 are given by\nd\u03c3e+ e\u2212 \u2192H+X (pH ) =\n\nX\nn\n\nd\u03c3\u0302e+ e\u2212 \u2192QQ\u0304[n]+X (pH ) hOnH i ,\n\n(2)\nwhere d\u03c3\u0302e+ e\u2212 \u2192QQ\u0304[n]+X (pH ) is an NRQCD coefficient\nfunction, projected onto heavy quark pair state QQ\u0304[n].\n\n\f2\nThe corresponding NRQCD operators are of the form [1]\nX\nOnH (0) =\n\u03c7\u2020 (0)\u03ban \u03c8(0) |N, Hi hN, H| \u03c8 \u2020 (0)\u03ba\u2032n \u03c7(0) ,\nN\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03ban and \u03ba\u2032n projections for color (octet or singlet)\nand spin, and where we suppress gauge links [9]. At\nLO, NRQCD singlet configurations are present only in\ndiagrams where the active quark and antiquark arise from\ndifferent lines, as in the first graph on the right-hand side\nof Fig. 1. In the second graph, the active pair is purely\noctet, and is expected to contribute at a much lower level\nto the cross section.\nFor NRQCD factorization to be predictive, it is necessary that the coefficient function, d\u03c3\u0302e+ e\u2212 \u2192QQ\u0304[n]+X (pH )\nbe infrared safe at higher orders. Not only infrared singularities, but also singular dependence in any of the relative velocities must be absorbed into the long-distance\nmatrix elements of the effective theory, a process referred\nto as matching. At LO, all gluons are off-shell by at\nleast a multiple of m, and the full LO amplitudes may\nbe absorbed into coefficient functions. Nontrivial issues\nof factorization and matching first arise at NLO.\nIt is a major undertaking to compute the full NLO corrections to the singlet NRQCD cross section [7], and all\nthe more so for the full four-particle cross section at finite\nrelative velocities. Nevertheless, it is relatively straightforward to check the self-consistency of the NRQCD factorization at NLO by verifying the cancellation of infrared poles.\nAs noted above, when more than two relative velocities\nare small, the standard NRQCD power counting does\nnot apply directly, simply because\nthere are now three\np\ndimensionless scales, \u03b2ij \u2261 1 \u2212 4m2 /(Pi + Pj )2 , i 6=\nj = 1, 2, 3, instead of the single v = \u03b212 defined by the\nactive pair. Thus, where there was once one \"soft\" region\nmv and one \"ultrasoft\" region mv 2 , there are now three\nof each. Let us see how these considerations emerge in\nthe NLO diagrams of Fig. 2.\nWe stress that the region of small relative velocity for\nthree of the four particles in double heavy-pair production\n\u221a is leading-power in the overall center-of-mass energy,\ns. For example, the two diagrams on the right-hand\nside of Fig. 1 contribute to the fragmentation of a heavy\nquark into the quark plus a pair. Such contributions also\noccur as part of the high-pT cross section for associated\nproduction in hadronic collisions, as studied in Ref. [6].\n\n\u2212 i g2\n\nZ\n\nIt is worth noting as well in this context that in such\nfragmentation-like contributions, the natural scale for \u03b1s\nis m, while for the corresponding LO contributions in\nwhich a light pair recoils\u221afrom a pair of heavy quarks, the\nnatural scale for \u03b1s is s. This is an additional source\nof relative enhancement for associated production, compared to J/\u03c8 cross sections with light quanta only.\nAs discussed extensively in [9], factorization requires\nthe cancellation of all infrared gluons that are not \"topologically factorized\". Only such contributions will match\nthe single-pair matrix elements of NRQCD. We may\nthink of a topologically factorized singularity as one that\ncan either be absorbed into a quarkonium matrix element or that does not involve either of the active heavy\nquarks. An example of the former is the first diagram in\nFig. 2, and of the latter, the second. After a sum over\nreal gluon emission at fixed color for the active quark\npair, exchanges between spectators cancel.\nThe third and fourth diagrams of Fig. 2, however, are\nnot topologically factorized, and include the transfer of\ncolor between the active pair produced at short distances\nand the spectator. A pair produced as an octet in the\nhard scattering may end up as a singlet in the final state.\nLet us see how this mechanism enters the NLO corrections, and why it is not a problem except in the region\nwhere the spectator comes close to the active pair.\nP1\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP2\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n+\n\nP3\n\nP3\nP4\n\nP4\n\nP1\n\nP1\n\nP2\n\nP2\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n\u03b3\u2217\n\n+\n\nP3\nP4\n\n+\n\nP3\n\n+ ***\n\nP4\n\nFIG. 2: Diagrams for one-loop virtual infrared corrections,\nwhere the blob represents a complete set of lowest order Feynman diagrams, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\nWhen \u03b2ij \u226a 1, the infrared pole behavior of any of the\nexchanges shown in Fig. 2 is given up to a sign by\n\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1\n4Pi * Pj\n1\n\u03b1s\ndD k\n(2\u03b2\n\u2212\ni\u03c0)\n+\n.\n.\n.\n, (4)\n\u2212\n+\n\u03b2\n=\nij\nij\n(2\u03c0)D [2Pi * k + k 2 + i\u01eb][\u22122Pj * k + k 2 + i\u01eb][k 2 + i\u01eb]\n2\u03c0\n2\u03b5 \u03b2ij\n\nwith corrections that are finite as \u03b5 = 2\u2212D/2 \u2192 0 or that\n\nvanish as higher powers of \u03b2ij . We will concentrate on the\n\n\f3\nimaginary term, which is singular for both vanishing \u03b2\nand \u03b5. Consider now the imaginary contributions of Eq.\n(4) to the NLO ampliude A, traced over the colors of the\nactive pair to enforce a singlet configuration in the final\nstate. Denoting by Aij the amplitude with an exchange\nbetween Pi and Pj , we have, suppressing common color\nfactors in the quark and antiquark couplings,\nIm [A13 + A23 ] =\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n2\n2\n\u03b1s (0)\n1 + \u03b223\n1 + \u03b213\n,(5)\n\u2212\nA (Pi )\n4\u03b5\n\u03b213\n\u03b223\n\nwhere A(0) represents the LO amplitude. From this soft\ngluon correction, the third and fourth diagrams in Fig.\n2 inherit color singlet configurations for the pair P1 , P2\nin the final state at NLO. We should mention that this\ncontribution is subleading in the number of colors Nc .\nIndeed, it constitutes an alternative mechanism to the\n\"preconfinement\" scenario, identified long ago in Ref.\n[11], and built into most hadronization models in event\ngenerators [12].\nThe essential feature of Eq (5) is the presence of poles\nin the relative velocities \u03b213 and \u03b223 . These poles cancel\nidentically for P1 * P3 = P2 * P3 or for P32 = 0. In the\nformer case, the relative velocity of the spectator quark\nand the active quark equals the relative velocity of the\nspectator and the active antiquark. Here, soft gluons\nemitted by the spectator cannot resolve the charges of\na perfectly co-moving pair in a singlet color state. Correspondingly, when the spectator is lightlike, its relative\nvelocity to either active line is unity, and the two terms\ncancel. Thus for pair production in the presence of massless quanta only (light quark pairs and gluons) the color\ntransfer mechanism is completely absent. This is an essential ingredient in the verification of NRQCD factorization at NNLO in Refs. [9, 10]. Evidently, a light-like\nspectator can neither resolve nor produce a color singlet\neven when the quark and antiquark are not co-moving.\nWe see here, however, that such a cancellation requires\nthat any heavy spectator be moving relativistically with\nrespect to the active pair. For nonrelativistic motion,\nthere is a nontrivial color transfer from the triplet spectator quark, that catalyzes the transition between octet\nand singlet.\nIf, as in Ref. [7], the active quark relative velocity v\nappears only as a regulator for active-active gluon exchange, nonfactorizing singularities never occur. At the\nsame time, at NLO, this cancellation is not exact in the\nlow-velocity region for the spectator. The color transfer contribution is neither topologically factorized nor infrared finite, and cannot be absorbed into the coefficient\nfunction for the singlet production amplitude. Although\nthis effect is purely imaginary at NLO, it will have a\nphysical role at higher orders.\nSince the infrared correction to the amplitude, A of (5)\nvanishes at vanishing active-pair relative momentum, it is\nnatural to expand A in v at fixed relative pair-spectator\nvelocity, which we will refer to as \u03b2S , between the spec-\n\ntator quark (of momentum P3 ) and P/2 [13],\ns\nr\n\u2212qS2\nqS2\nP0\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03b2S =\n+ qS\u03bc ,\n,\nP\n=\n1\n\u2212\n3\nm2 \u2212 qS2\n2\nm2\n\n(6)\n\nwith P0\u03bc = (2m, 0) and qS *P0 = 0. Expanding in the relative momentum of the active pair in the spirit of NRQCD,\nwe find\n1\n1\n4 qS * q\n4\n\u2212\n\u223c\u2212 3\n\u223c 2 v cos \u03c6S ,\n\u03b213\n\u03b223\n\u03b2S m2\n\u03b2S\n\n(7)\n\nwhere in the second relation \u03c6S is the angle between the\nvectors ~qS and ~q. The presence of the cosine, which is odd\nunder the interchange of the members of the active pair,\nis an expression of the dipole nature of this contribution\nto the amplitude.\nAlthough the expansion in Eq. (7) is applicable in only\na limited region of phase space, it is a region in which the\nactive pair and spectator quark form a system of invariant mass of order (3m)2 . In this kinematic region, the\nsquares of NLO corrections to LO diagrams like those on\nthe right-hand side of Fig. 1 contribute to the cross section at leading power in the overall center-of-mass energy.\nAt NNLO, the squares of the imaginary poles of Eq. (4)\nproduce \u03b14s (1/\u03b52 ) corrections to the cross section. All\nother diagrams contribute only at the single-pole level\n[13]. We note again, that in accordance with the results\nof Ref. [9], this contribution vanishes in the limit m \u2192 0,\nand so is consistent with NRQCD factorization at large\npT .\nIn summary, we have identified a new, leading-power\n\"color-transfer\" infrared-divergent contribution to the\nformation of color-singlet pairs, which is specific to associated production. This contribution must be added\nto that of the familiar color-octet mechanism [1]. The\ninfrared divergence signals that color transfer cannot be\nabsorbed into a coefficient function, while its dependence\non \u03b2S signals that it cannot be absorbed into matrix elements in an effective field theory based on the dynamics of a single pair. This mechanism is non-leading in\nthe number of colors, although that by itself should not\neliminate it from consideration.\nIt is natural to try and estimate the magnitude of this\nnew effect. A plausible estimate can be given by elaborating on the analogy just observed between the normal\ncolor octet mechanism and color transfer. In both cases,\nan S-wave pair is transformed to P-wave by the gluonic\nfield strength contracted with the pair's color dipole. In\nthe octet mechanism, the field couples to the polarization\nof an emitted gluon, while in color transfer it is coupled\nto the Coulomb field of the spectator. To return to an Swave state, we will assume a \u03b2S -independent v 2 suppression, following NRQCD power counting [1, 2]. At fixed\n\u03b2S , let us assume that the nonperturbative formation of\nquarkonium state, H is similar for these two transitions.\nWe then square the \u03b2S -dependent kinematic factor of Eq.\n(7), and replace the v-dependence by the NRQCD matrix\nelement h3 S8H i. In the total cross section at fixed \u03b2S , such\n\n\f4\na quantity would be additive to the color singlet contribution, which dominates in the NRQCD treatment. We\n\nthus have, schematically,\n\n3 H\nd\u03c3etot\n+ e\u2212 \u2192H+X (pH ) \u223c d\u03c3\u0302e+ e\u2212 \u2192QQ\u0304[S ]+Q\u2032 (\u03b2 ) (pH ) h S1 i + d\u03c3\u0302e+ e\u2212 \u2192QQ\u0304[S ]+Q\u2032 (\u03b2 ) (pH )\n1\nS\n8\nS\n\nh3 S8H i\n,\n\u03b2S4\n\n(8)\n\nthat is, the standard color singlet, plus a color-octet contribution enhanced by the factor 1/\u03b2S4 , with \u03b2S the velocity of the closest heavy spectator, Q\u2032 = Q, Q\u0304. By\nnumerical evaluation, we have verified [13] that the shortdistance cross section, d\u03c3\u0302e+ e\u2212 \u2192QQ\u0304[S8 ]+Q\u2032 (\u03b2S ) (pH ) is also\nlarger than the corresponding singlet contribution. At\n\u03b2S \u223c 0.3, our estimate of color transfer would then become competitive with the color singlet cross section at\nthe same \u03b2S . Of course, for \u03b2S < v an expansion in v/\u03b2S\nloses meaning, and we do not offer Eq. (8) as a realistic\nestimate, especially for J/\u03c8, with v \u223c 0.5. We do present\nit, however, as an indication of the possible importance\nof the new mechanism.\nA signature of the color-transfer process would clearly\nbe an enhancement in any open heavy flavor at low relative velocity to quarkonia, in hadronic scattering as well\nas leptonic annihilation. Another sign could be in studies of polarization. As observed in Ref. [6] in the context\nof LO NRQCD, associated production leads to a more\ncomplex polarization structure than that expected from\na pure octet mechanism. Although color transfer does\nnot fall cleanly into the analysis of NRQCD, we might\nexpect much the same spin symmetry to apply, so that\na study of polarization effects can also help characterize\nthis mechanism.\nTo develop an effective theory that incorporates color\ntransfer, we shall have to add new operators. As already found in Ref. [9] in the context of NRQCD factor-\n\nization, the long-distance transition from octet to color\nsinglet states can\nR \u221ebe associated with a nonlocal operator of the form 0 d\u03bb\u2032 \u03bb\u2032 [ P \u03bc q \u03bd F\u03bd\u03bc,a (\u03bb\u2032 P ) ], with P and\nq as in Eq. (1). Noting that \u03bb\u2032 q can be interpreted as\nthe configuration-space separation of a pair, we see that\nthis is the same operator that represents the singlet-octet\ntransition in the potential NRQCD Hamiltonian [14, 15],\nhere extended to production. It is clear, however, that\nthis correspondence holds only in the region where we\ncan strongly order the velocities. More generally, we shall\nhave to introduce products of three fields, as \u03c8P\u2020 1 \u03c7P2 \u03c8P\u2020 3 ,\nwhose interactions with the soft gluon field will be labeled\nby momenta (as in NRQCD) according to heavy quark\neffective theory. In general the nonperturbative dynamics these operators will overlap with those of NRQCD, as\nwell as those of potential NRQCD. It will require some\ncare to avoid double counting and to develop a formalism\nthat can be matched to the phenomenology of associated\nproduction.\nWe thank Geoff Bodwin for many useful discussions\non factorization.
