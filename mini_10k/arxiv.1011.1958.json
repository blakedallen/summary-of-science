The stable WRT invariant of links in a 3-sphere with handles. Let Z(O) \u2208\nQ[[q, q \u22121 ] be a Laurent series of q which is a topological invariant of an object O (e.g. a link\nin a 3-manifold). A general idea of a (weak) categorification, as presented in [Kho00], is to\nL\nassociate to O a Z \u2295 Z-graded vector space H(O) = i,j\u2208Z Hi,j (O), the first degree being of\nhomological nature, such that its graded Euler characteristic is equal to Z(O):\nZ(O) =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i q j dim Hi,j (O).\n\n(1.1)\n\ni,j\u2208Z\n\nA full categorification extends this assignment to a functor from the category of link cobordisms to the category of homogeneous maps between bigraded vector spaces.\nLet L be a framed link in a 3-manifold M. The SU(2) Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev (WRT)\ninvariant Zr (L, M) is a C-valued topological invariant of the pair (L, M) which depends on an\ninteger number r \u2265 2. We assume that the components of L are 'colored' by the fundamental\nrepresentation of SU(2) and if L is an empty link, then we omit it from notations.\nGenerally, the dependence of Zr (L, M) on r seems random and the non-polynomial nature\nof Zr (L, M) presents a challenge for anyone trying to categorify it. However, there is a special\nclass of 3-manifolds (3-spheres with handles) for which Zr (L, M) is almost polynomial. Let\nS3|k denote a 3-sphere S3 from which k 3-balls are cut. Let S3g|k denote oriented manifold\nconstructed by gluing 2g spherical boundary components of S3|2g+k pairwise. A 3-sphere with\ng handles S3g is defined as S3g|0 : S3g = S3g|0 . Alternatively, S3g can be constructed by gluing\ntogether two handlebodies of genus g through the identity isomorphism of their boundaries.\nA link L in S3g can be constructed by taking a (n1 , . . . , n2g )-tangle \u03c4 in S3|2g with pairwise\nmatching valences ni = ni+g and applying the pairwise gluing to the boundary components\nof S3|2g and to the tangle endpoints which reside there. If at least one of the valences is odd,\nthen the WRT invariant associated with the resulting link is zero for any r, hence we will\nalways assume that all valences are even. For a (2n1 , . . . , 2n2g )-tangle \u03c4 in S3|2g we define the\ncritical level:\nrcr (\u03c4, S3|2g ) = max(n1 , . . . , ng ) + 2.\nWe define the critical level rcr (L, S3g ) of a link L \u2282 S3g as the minimum of rcr (\u03c4, S3|2g ) over all\nthe presentation of L as the closure of a tangle.\nThe following theorem is easy to prove:\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.1. For a link L in a 3-sphere with g handles S3g there exists a unique rational\nfunction J(L, S3g ) \u2208 Q(q) such that if r \u2265 rcr (L, S3g ), then the modified WRT invariant\nZ\u0303r (L, S3g )\n\nZr (L, S3g )\n=\nZr (S3g )\n\nis equal to the evaluation of J(L, S3g ) at q = exp(i\u03c0/r):\nZ\u0303r (L, S3g ) = J(L, S3g )|q=exp(i\u03c0/r) .\n\n(1.2)\n\nWe call J(L, S3g ) the stable WRT invariant of L \u2282 S3g . We expect that Laurent series\nexpansion of J(L, S3g ) at q = 0 can be categorified in the sense of eq.(1.1).\nIf g = 0, then S3g is a 3-sphere S3 . In this case rcr (L, S3 ) = 2 and J(L, S3 ) is the Jones\npolynomial whose categorification was constructed in [Kho00].\nIn this paper we consider the case of g = 1, that is, we study S31 = S2 \u00d7 S1 . It turns out\nthat the corresponding stable WRT invariant J(L, S2 \u00d7 S1 ) is again a Laurent polynomial,\nand we construct its categorification.\n1.2. A 3-dimensional oriented restricted TQFT. The stable WRT invariant J(L, S3g )\ncomes from a stable restricted topological WRT theory. Let us recall the definition of a\n3-dimensional oriented restricted TQFT (a generalization to n dimensions is obvious).\nLet F be a field with an involution\n \u0304 : F \u2212\u2192 F.\n\n(1.3)\n\nUsually, F = C,  \u0304 being the complex conjugation.\nLet S be the set of admissible connected boundaries: its elements are some closed oriented\nconnected 2-manifolds with marked points. S always includes the empty surface \u2205.\nLet M be a 3-dimensional manifold with a boundary consisting of k connected components\nfrom S, each having ni (i = 1, . . . , k) marked points. An identification of the boundary of M\nis a choice of a diffeomorphism between every connected component of \u2202M and its 'standard\ncopy' in S.\nA n-tangle in M, where n = (n1 , . . . , nk ), is an embedding of a disjoint union of segments\nand circles in M such that the endpoints of segments are mapped one-to-one to the marked\npoints on the boundary \u2202M. Our tangles are assumed to be framed. Let T\u0303(M) be the set\nof all n-tangles in M distinguished up to boundary fixing ambient isotopy.\nA diffeomorphism M \u2192 M is called relative if it acts trivially on the boundary of M.\nLet MapM denote the mapping class group of relative homeomorphisms of M. This group\n\n\f4\n\nL. ROZANSKY\n\nacts on T\u0303(M), and we refer to the elements of the quotient T(M) = T\u0303(M)/ MapM as rough\ntangles, that is, rough tangles are tangles distinguished up to relative homeomorphisms.\nLet M be the set of admissible manifolds: its elements are some oriented 3-manifolds with\nindependently oriented boundary components, each boundary component being admissible.\nThe set M must include the manifolds S \u00d7 I for all S \u2208 S and I = [0, 1]. Also M must be\nclosed with respect to two operations. The first operation is the disjoint union of admissible\nmanifolds. The second operation is the gluing of two diffeomorphic connected components\nof \u2202M, provided that they have opposite relative orientations with respect to the orientation\nof M.\nTo an admissible boundary S \u2208 S the TQFT associates a Hilbert space H(S) over F with\nthree isomorphisms\n\u2666, \u25bd : H(S) \u2212\u2192 H\u2228 (S),\n\n \u0304 : H(S) \u2212\u2192 H(S).\n\n(1.4)\n\nHere H\u2228 is the dual of H and the maps \u25bd and  \u0304 are 'anti-linear': they involve the involution (1.3) of the field F. The maps (1.4) should satisfy the relations\n(v\u0304)\u2666 = v \u25bd ,\n\n(v\u0304)\u25bd = v \u2666 ,\n\nv\u0304 \u0304 = v.\n\n(1.5)\n\nfor all v \u2208 H(S). If any two of three isomorphisms (1.4) are defined, then the third one is\ndetermined by either of the first two relations (1.5). Slightly abusing notations, we will use\nthe same notations \u2666 and \u25bd for the inverses of the isomorphisms (1.4); in each case it will\nbe clear whether a direct or an inverse isomorphism is used.\nTo a disjoint union of admissible boundaries TQFT associates a tensor product of Hilbert\nspaces over F:\nH(S1 \u2294 * * * \u2294 Sk ) = H(S1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 H(Sk ).\nFor the empty boundary H(\u2205) = F.\nLet M be an admissible manifold. The relative orientation of M and connected components of its boundary separates \u2202M into two disjoint components: the 'in' boundary and the\n'out' boundary: \u2202M = (\u2202M)in \u2294 (\u2202M)out . Define\nH(\u2202M) = H(\u2202M)out \u2297 H\u2228 (\u2202M)in .\nFor every identification of \u2202M the TQFT provides a state map, which maps rough tangles\n\u03c4 in M to elements of the Hilbert space of its boundary:\nh\u2212i : T(M) \u2212\u2192 H(\u2202M),\n\n(\u03c4, M) 7\u2192 h\u03c4, Mi.\n\nThe state map should satisfy the following axioms:\n\n(1.6)\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n5\n\nChange of orientation of the boundary component: A change in the orientation\nof a boundary component of M results in the application of the \u2666 map to the corresponding factor in the Hilbert space H(\u2202M).\nChange of orientation of M: If M \u2032 is the manifold M with reversed orientation,\nthen h\u03c4, M \u2032 i = h\u03c4, Mi\u25bd \u2208 H\u2228 (\u2202M) (since we did not change the orientation of\nthe boundary components, the 'in' boundary component of M becomes the 'out'\nboundary component of M \u2032 and vice versa).\nDisjoint union: For two admissible pairs (\u03c41 , M1 ) and (\u03c42 , M2 ), the state map of their\ndisjoint union is h\u03c41 \u2294 \u03c42 , M1 \u2294 M2 i = h\u03c41 , M1 i \u2297 h\u03c42 , M2 i.\nGluing: Suppose that the same admissible boundary component S appears in the 'in'\nand in the 'out' parts of M. Let M \u2032 be the manifold constructed by gluing these\ncomponents together (according to their identifications with the 'standard copy').\nThen h\u03c4, M \u2032 i is the result of canonical pairing x applied to the tensor product H(S)\u2297\nH\u2228 (S) within the Hilbert space H(\u2202M).\nIf follows from the change of orientation axioms and relations (1.5) that if M \u2032 is the\nmanifold M in which the orientation of M and of its boundary are reversed simultaneously,\nthen h\u03c4, M \u2032 i = h\u03c4, Mi.\nIn the stable restricted topological WRT theory the base field F is Q(q) \u2013 the field of\nrational functions of q with rational coefficients. Admissible boundaries are 2-spheres with\n2n marked points, n \u2265 0 and admissible 3-manifolds are S3g|k and their disjoint unions. In\nthis paper we will consider a more restricted ('toy') version of this theory. Namely, the\nadmissible 3-manifolds are only S30 = S3 (a 3-sphere), S30|1 = B3 (a 3-ball), S30|2 = S2 \u00d7 I,\nS31 = S2 \u00d7 S1 and their disjoint unions.\nWe will show in subsections 3.3.4 that J(L, S3 ) = hL, S3 i is equal to the Jones polynomial\nof L and we will prove in subsection A.2 that the invariant J(L, S2 \u00d7 S1 ) = hL, S2 \u00d7 S1 i is a\nLaurent polynomial of q and satisfies the property (1.2), which is this case takes the form\nZr (L, S2 \u00d7 S1 ) = hL, S2 \u00d7 S1 i|q=exp(i\u03c0/r)\n\n(1.7)\n\nfor r \u2265 rcr (L, S2 \u00d7 S1 ), because Zr (S2 \u00d7 S1 ) = 1.\n1.3. A Z-graded weak algebraic categorification. In this paper we will construct a\nweak algebraic categorification of the toy stable restricted topological WRT theory.\nLet us recall basic facts about a Z-graded version of a weak algebraic categorical 3dimensional TQFT. We use the same set of admissible boundaries S and the set of admissible 3-manifolds M as in previous subsection. To an admissible boundary S \u2208 S an\nalgebraic categorical TQFT associates a Z-graded algebra A(S) and an additive category\n\n\f6\n\nL. ROZANSKY\n\nC(S) = Db (A(S)), that is, the bounded derived category of Z-graded A(S)-modules. Each\nalgebra has a canonical involution\n\u2666 : A(S) \u2212\u2192 Aop (S)\n\n(1.8)\n\nwhich preserves Z-grading. There are two equivalence functors\n\u2666, \u25bd : Db (A(S)) \u2212\u2192 Db (Aop (S)).\n\n(1.9)\n\nThe functor \u2666 is covariant: it turns a complex of A(S)-modules into a complex of Aop (S)modules with the help of the involution (1.8) and shifts its homological and Z gradings by\nan amount depending on S. The functor \u25bd is contravariant: it maps objects to their duals\nand then shifts their degree by an amount depending on S.

A brief account of the results and the plan of the paper. We construct a\nweak categorification of the stable toy WRT theory. Our construction is based on Z-graded\nop\nalgebras Hn introduced in [Kho02]. In the same paper, a complex hh\u03c4 iiK of Hn \u2297Hm\n-modules\nis associated to a diagram of a (2m, 2n)-tangle \u03c4 .\nIn this paper we associate the algebra Hn and a derived category of Z-graded Hn -modules\nD (Hn ) to a 2-sphere with 2n marked points. A tangle \u03c4 in a 3-ball can be considered as a\n(0, 2n)-tangle, hence we associate to it the same complex hh\u03c4 iiK this time considered as an\nobject of Db (Hn ). A link L in S3 can be constructed by gluing two tangles in 3-balls along\nthe common boundary. As explained in [Kho02], the Hn -modules in hh\u03c4 iiK are projective,\nhence the gluing rule implies that stable homology of L \u2282 S3 coincides with the homology\nintroduced in [Kho00].\nb\n\nThe boundary category of the manifold S2 \u00d7I with 2m marked points on the 'in' boundary\nop\nand 2n marked points on the 'out' boundary is Db (Hn \u2297 Hm\n). If a tangle \u03c3 in S2 \u00d7 I is represented by a (2m, 2n)-tangle \u03c4 then we set again hh\u03c3ii = hh\u03c4 iiK . We prove that if two different\n(2m, 2n)-tangles \u03c41 and \u03c42 represent the same tangle in S2 \u00d7 I, then the complexes hh\u03c41 iiK\nand hh\u03c42 iiK are quasi-isomorphic, that is, although they may be homotopically inequivalent,\nop\nthey represent isomorphic objects in derived category Db (Hn \u2297 Hm\n).\nIf a link L in S2 \u00d7 S1 is presented as a closure of a (2n, 2n)-tangle \u03c4 within S2 \u00d7 S1 , then\nin accordance with the gluing rule we define the stable homology of L as the Hochschild\nhomology of hh\u03c4 iiK : Hst (L; S2 \u00d7 S1 ) = HH\u2022 (hh\u03c4 iiK ). We prove that this homology does not\ndepend on the choice of a tangle \u03c4 which represents L.\nFinally, we suggest a practical method of computing the stable homology Hst (L; S2 \u00d7 S1 ).\nIf L \u2282 S2 \u00d7 S1 can be constructed by a S2 \u00d7 S1 closure of a (2n, 2n)-tangle \u03c4 , then it is known\nthat the stable invariant hL, S2 \u00d7 S1 i can be approximated (up to the coefficients at high\npowers of q) by the Kauffman bracket of the S3 closure of \u03c4 through the torus braid with high\ntwist number. We show that the same is true in categorified theory: Khovanov homology\nof the S3 closure of \u03c4 through a high twist torus braid approximates the stable homology\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n9\n\nof L in S2 \u00d7 S1 . In fact, a close relation between the Hochschild homology of Hn and the\nKhovanov homology of a high twist torus link was first observed by Jozef Przytycki [Prz10]\nin case of n = 1.\nIn Section 2 we review the definition and properties of Kauffman bracket and TemperleyLieb algebra. We define the stable toy WRT theory and prove that it satisfies the axiom\nrequirement. Then we review Khovanov homology, Bar-Natan's universal categorification of\nthe Temperley-Lieb algebra [BN05] and bi-module categorification of Temperley-Lieb algebra [Kho02].\nIn Section 6 we present main results of the paper: we define the categorified theory,\nexplain how stable homology is related to Khovanov homology through torus braid closure\nand conjecture the structure of Hochschild homology and cohomology of algebras Hn .\nIn Section 7 we prove that the categorified theory is well-defined and satisfies the axioms.\nIn Section 8 we prove that torus braid closures of tangles within S3 approximate the stable homology of their closures within S2 \u00d7 S1 . In Section A we review the properties of\nJones-Wenzl projectors and prove the relation (1.7) between the complete and stable WRT\ninvariants of links in S2 \u00d7 S1 .\nAcknowledgements. The work on this paper was started jointly with Mikhail Khovanov.\nIn particular, we worked out the proofs of Theorems 6.1 and 6.3 together.

Basic definition.\n2.1.1. Tangles. All tangles and links in this paper are framed, and in pictures we assume\nblackboard framing. We use a notation\n= \u25e61\nfor a framing twist.\nFor a 3-manifold M with a boundary we have defined the set of tangles T\u0303(M), the relative\nmapping class group MapM and the set of rough tangles T(M) = T\u0303(M)/ MapM in subsection 1.2. For a 2-dimensional manifold \u03a3 being either R2 or S2 , let T\u0303m,n (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) \u2282 T\u0303(\u03a3 \u00d7 I)\ndenote the set of (m, n)-tangles, that is, tangles with m marked points on the 'in' boundary\n\u03a3\u00d7{0} and with n marked points on the 'out' boundary \u03a3\u00d7{1}. We use a shortcut notation\n\n\f10\n\nL. ROZANSKY\n\nT\u0303n (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) = T\u0303n,n (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) and we use similar notations for rough tangles with T\u0303 replaced by\nT. Note that MapR2 is trivial, so T(R2 ) = T\u0303(R2 ).\nThe set T\u0303(\u03a3 \u00d7 I) of all tangles in \u03a3 \u00d7 I and its quotient T(\u03a3 \u00d7 I) have the structure of a\nset of morphisms: the multiplication corresponds to the composition of tangles \u03c41 \u25e6 \u03c42 . We\nuse the notation T\u0303op (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) to denote the same set of morphisms with the opposite order of\ncomposing elements. The set of morphisms T\u0303(\u03a3 \u00d7 I) is 'quiver-like', because the composition\nof tangles is meaningful only when the numbers of end-points match, otherwise we set it to\nzero; in other words, the set of morphismss T\u0303n (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) stand at the vertices of the quiver and\nthe sets T\u0303m,n (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) stand at its oriented edges.\nThe braid group Bn (\u03a3) is a subgroup of T\u0303n (\u03a3 \u00d7 I) and, in particular, the Artin braid\ngroup Bn is a subgroup of T(R2 ).

Tangles in R2 \u00d7 I. The most commonly used tangles are tangles in R2 \u00d7 I and we refer\nto them simply as tangles. Tangles may be considered as morphisms of the tangle category:\nan object of this category is a set of m linearly ordered points, an (m, n)-tangle \u03c4 is a\nmorphism between m points and n points and a composition of morphisms is a composition\nof tangles. Thus the set of all tangles T = T(R2 ) is the set of morphisms in this category.\nThe set of morphisms T has three special involutions\n\u2666, \u25bd : T \u2212\u2192 Top ,\n\nTm,n \u2212\u2192 Tn,m,\n\n \u0304 : T \u2212\u2192 T,\n\nTm,n \u2212\u2192 Tm,n\n\n(2.3)\n\nsatisfying the relations (1.5). The first two turn a (m, n)-tangle \u03c4 into a (n, m)-tangle. The\nflip \u2666 rotates \u03c4 by 180\u25e6 about an axis which lies in the blackboard plane and is perpendicular\nto the time-line. The duality \u25bd performs the flip and then switches all crossings of the tangle\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n11\n\ninto the opposite ones. In other words, \u03c4 \u25bd is the mirror image of \u03c4 with respect to the plane\nwhich is perpendicular to the time line.  \u0304 just switches all crossings of a tangle.\n2.2. Temperley-Lieb tangles and crossingless matchings.\n2.2.1. Definitions. A tangle is planar if it can be presented by a diagram without crossings.\nA planar tangle is called Temperley-Lieb (TL) if it is boundary connected, that is, if it does\nnot contain disjoint circles. We denote TL tangles by the letter \u03bb and TTL \u2282 T denotes the\nset of all TL tangles. Since TL tangles have no crossings, then \u03bb\u0304 = \u03bb and the action of \u2666\nand \u25bd coincide: \u03bb\u2666 = \u03bb\u25bd .\nThe TL (0, 2n)-tangles are called crossingless n-matchings, and their set is denoted Cn =\nS\nAll crossingless matchings form the set C = n Cn \u2282 TTL .

ROZANSKY\n\n3.1.1. Definitions. A Temperley-Lieb algebra TL is a ring generated, as a module, freely by\nTL tangles, that is, by the elements h\u03bbi, \u03bb \u2208 TTL over the ring Z[q, q \u22121 ]. The product in TL\ncorresponds to the composition of tangles and is denoted by \u25e6. If the numbers of endpoints\ndo not match, then the product is defined to be zero. Any disjoint circle appearing in the\ncomposition is replaced by the factor \u2212(q + q \u22121 ):\n\u2260\n\n\u2211\n\n= \u2212(q + q \u22121 ).\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe Kauffman bracket relation\n\u2260\n\n\u2211\n\n= q\n\n1\n2\n\n\u2260\n\n\u2211\n\n+ q\n\n\u2212 21\n\n\u2260\n\n\u2211\n\n(3.2)\n\nassociates a TL element\nh\u03c4 i =\n\nX\n\na\u03bb (\u03c4 ) h\u03bbi,\n\na\u03bb (\u03c4 ) =\n\nX\n\na\u03bb,i (\u03c4 ) q i\n\n(3.3)\n\ni\u2208Z\n\n\u03bb\u2208TTL\n\nto any tangle \u03c4 .

This extension is well-defined,\nbecause the involutions preserve the Kauffman bracket relation (3.2) as well as the unknot\ninvariant formula (3.1).\n3.1.2. Subrings of the Temperley-Lieb algebra and their bimodules. As a Z[q, q \u22121 ]-module,\nTL contains submodules TLm,n (n \u2212 m is even) generated by (m, n)-tangles. The 'diagonal' submodules TLn,n , which we denote for brevity as TLn , are, in fact, subrings of TL.\nObviously, TLm,n is a module over the ring TLn \u2297 TLop\nm.\nThe empty tangle \u03bb\u2205 is the only TL (0, 0)-tangle, hence the ring TL0 is canonically isomorphic to Z[q, q \u22121 ]. A (0, 0)-tangle L is just a link, and the corresponding Kauffman bracket\nequals its Jones polynomial: hLi = J(L, S3 ). The cyclic closure of an (n, n)-tangle in S3\n(\u2212;S3 )\n\nproduces a trace on the ring TLn : TLn \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 TL0 = Z[q, q \u22121 ].\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n15\n\n3.2. The Jones-Wenzl projectors. We use two versions of the Temperley-Lieb algebra\ndefined over the rings other than Z[q, q \u22121 ]. The Temperley-Lieb algebra QTL is generated\nby TL tangles over the field Q(q) of rational functions of q and TL+ is the TemperleyLieb algebra over the field Q[[q, q \u22121 ] of Laurent power series. An injective homomorphism\nQ(q) \u0592\u2192 Q[[q, q \u22121 ] generated by the Laurent series expansion at q = 0 produces an injective\nhomomorphism of Temperley-Lieb algebras QTL \u0592\u2192 TL+ .\nThe algebra QTLn contains central mutually orthogonal idempotent elements Pn,m (0 \u2264\nm \u2264 n, n \u2212 m \u2208 2Z) known as Jones-Wenzl projectors:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2Pn,m ,\n\nif m = m\u2032 ,\n\nPn,m \u25e6 Pn,m\u2032 = \uf8f4\n\uf8f30,\n\nX\n\nif m 6= m\u2032 ,\n\n.\nPn,m = ..\n\nn.\n\n(3.6)\n\n0\u2264m\u2264n\nn\u2212m\u22082Z\n\nThese projectors are defined by the relations (3.6) and by the conditions\nJ\n\n \u0308\n\nn\n\n\u2202\n\n\u25e6 Pn,m = 0,\n\nif d > n \u2212 m,\n\nJ\n\n \u0308\n\n\u2202\n\nn .

A stable Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev theory. Let us describe in more detail the\nstable toy WRT theory that we want to categorify.\n3.3.1. Basic structure. As we mentioned at the end of subsectionss:ortqft, its base field F\nis the field Q(q) of rational functions of q. The involution  \u0304 is defined by its action on\nq: q\u0304 = q \u22121 . Admissible boundaries are 2-spheres S2n with 2n marked points. Admissible\nmanifolds are disjoint unions of four 3-manifolds: B3 , S2 \u00d7 I, S3 and S2 \u00d7 S1 . In fact, all\nadmissible manifolds are generated by B3 and S2 \u00d7 I through disjoint union and gluing.\nTherefore the TQFT is defined by the choice of Hilbert spaces H(S2n ) and state maps for\nrough tangles in B3 and in S2 \u00d7I, because the other state maps are determined by the axioms.\n3.3.2. Hilbert spaces. To a 2-sphere with 2n marked points the stable toy theory associates\na Q(q)-module H(S2n ) = QTL0,2n , which, by definition, is a free Q(q)-module generated by\n(Kauffman brackets of) crossingless n-matchings. The module H\u2228 (S2n ) = QTL2n,0 is canonically dual to H(S2n ), the pairing being defined by the Kauffman bracket of the composition of\n \u0308 \u2202\n \u0308\n\u2202\ntangles: \u03b1\u2666 xh\u03b2i = \u03b1\u2666 \u25e6 \u03b2 . The involutions (1.4) are the corresponding involutions (3.5)\nrestricted to QTL2n,0 .\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n17\n\n3.3.3. A state map for tangles in B3 and in S2 \u00d7 I. If we orient the boundary of an oriented\n3-ball B3 in the 'out' direction and put 2n marked points on it, then using the bijection (2.5)\nwe set h\u03c4, B3 i = h\u03c4 i.\nWe set the orientation of the boundary component S2 \u00d7 {0} as 'in', the orientation of\nthe boundary component S2 \u00d7 {1} as 'out' and put 2m and 2n marked points on them.\nAccording to eq.(3.9),\nH(S2n ) \u2297Q(q) H\u2228 (S2m ) = QTLspl\n2m,2n ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nhence the state map has the form\n\u2212, S2 \u00d7 I : T(S2 \u00d7 I) \u2212\u2192 QTLspl .\n\n \u0308\n\n\u2202\n\n(3.15)\n\nThe gluing axiom implies that it must be a homomorphism and we define it by the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem 3.2. There exists a unique homomorphism (3.15) such that the diagram\ns\n\nT\n\n/ /\n\nT(S2 \u00d7 I)\nh\u2212,S2 \u00d7Ii\n\nh\u2212i\n\n\u000f\n\nTL\n\n(3.16)\n\n\u000f\n\nP\u0302\u2217,0\n\n/\n\nQTLspl\n\nis commutative, that is, for any \u03c4 \u2208 T2m,2n\n \u0308\n\ns(\u03c4 ), S2 \u00d7 I = P2n,0 \u25e6 h\u03c4 i .\n\u2202\n\n(3.17)\n\nProof. Since the homomorphism s is surjective, it is sufficient to show that ker s is 'untangled'\nby the composition of the Kauffman bracket h\u2212i and the projector P\u0302\u2217,0 . According to\n\u2704\n1\n.\nTheorem 2.3, ker s is generated by the braids \u25e6**\u2701 \u2702 2n and .. 2n, so we have to show that\n2\n\nP2n,0 \u25e6 h\u03c4 i = P2n,0 for \u03c4 being either of these ker s\u0303-generating braids. The latter relations\nfollow from the the formula (3.11) and from the isotopies \u03b1\u2666 \u25e6 \u03c4 \u2248 \u03b1\u2666 which hold true for\nany TL (0, 2n)-tangle \u03b1.\n\u0003\n\n3.3.4. The invariant of links in S3 and in S2 \u00d7 S1 . Since S3 can be constructed by gluing\ntogether two 3-balls B3 , the gluing property dictates that the toy invariant of a link L in B3\nis its Kauffman bracket: hL, B3 i = hLi.\nIf the manifold S2 \u00d7 I has 2n marked points on both boundary components, then the\ncorresponding Hilbert module (3.14) becomes the module of endomorphisms:\nH \u2202(S2 \u00d7 I) = QTLspl\n2n = EndQ(q) (QTL0,2n ).\n\u00c4\n\n\u00e4\n\n(3.18)\n\n\f18\n\nL.

Categorification\n4.1. A triply graded categorification of the Jones polynomial. In [Kho00] M. Khovanov introduced a categorification of the Jones polynomial of links. To a diagram L of a\nlink he associates a complex of graded vector spaces over Q\nhhLii = (* * * \u2192 Ci \u2192 Ci+1 \u2192 * * *)\n\n(4.1)\n\nso that if two diagrams represent the same link then the corresponding complexes are homotopy equivalent, and the graded Euler characteristic of hhLii is equal to the Jones polynomial\nof L. As a complex of vector spaces, hhLii is homotopically equivalent to its homology known\n\u00c4\n\u00e4\nas Khovanov homology of the link L: H\u2022 hhLii = HKh\n\u2022 (L).\nThus, overall, the complex (4.1) has two gradings: the first one was the homological\ngrading of the complex, the corresponding degree being equal to i, and the second grading was\nthe grading related to powers of q. In this paper we adopt a slightly different convention which\nis convenient for working with framed links and tangles. It is inspired by matrix factorization\ncategorification [KR08] and its advantage is that it is no longer necessary to assign orientation\n\n\f20\n\nL. ROZANSKY\n\nto link strands in order to obtain the grading of the categorification complex (4.1) which\nwould make it invariant under the second Reidemeister move.\nTo a framed link diagram L we associate a Z \u2295 Z \u2295 Z2 -graded complex (4.1) with degrees\ndegh , degq and deg2 . The first two gradings are of the same nature as in [Kho00] and, in\nparticular, degh Ci = i. The third grading is an inner grading of chain modules defined\nmodulo 2 and of homological nature, that is, the homological parity of an element of hhLii,\nwhich affects various sign factors, is the sum of degh and deg2 . Both homological degrees are\neither integer or half-integer simultaneously, so the homological parity is integer and takes\nvalues in Z2 . The q-degree degq may also take half-integer values.\nLet [m, l, n] denote the shift of three degrees by l, m and n units respectively1 . We use\nabbreviated notations\n[l, m] = [l, m, 0] ,\n\n[m]h,q = [m, m] ,\n\n[m]q = [0, m, 0] ,\n\n[m]q,2 = [0, m, m] .\n\nAfter the grading modification, the categorification formulas of [Kho00] take the following\nform: the module associated with an unknot is still Z[x]/(x2 ) but with a different degree\nassignment:\n\u2211\u2211\n\n\u2260\u2260\n\ndegq 1 = 0,\n\n= Z[x]/(x2 ) [0, \u22121, 1] ,\n\ndegq x = 2,\n\n(4.2)\n\ndegh 1 = degh x = deg2 1 = deg2 x = 0,\n\n(4.3)\n\nand the categorification complex of a crossing is the same as in [Kho00] but with a different\ndegree shift:\n\u00e9\n\n\u00d1\n\u2260\u2260\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n\u2260\u2260\n\n=\n\n\u2211\u2211 \u00ee\n\nf\n\n\u2212 12 , 21 , 21 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\u00f3\n\n\u2260\u2260\n\n\u2211\u2211 \u00ee\n\n1\n, \u2212 21 , \u2212 12\n2\n\n\u00f3\n\n,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere f is either a multiplication or a comultiplication of the ring Z[x]/(x2 ) depending on\nhow the arcs in the r.h.s. are closed into circles. The resulting categorification complex (4.1)\nis invariant up to homotopy under the second and third Reidemeister moves, but it acquires\na degree shift under the first Reidemeister move:\n\u2260\u2260\n\n\u2211\u2211\n\n\u25e61\n\n=\n\n\u2260\u2260 \u2211\u2211 \u00ee\n\n\u2212 21 , 32 , \u2212 21 .\n\u00f3\n\n(4.5)\n\nIt is easy to see that the whole categorification complex (4.1) has a homogeneous degree\ndeg2 .\n1\n\nOur degree shift is defined in such a way that if an object M has a homogeneous degree n, then the\nshifted object M [1] has a homogeneous degree n + 1.\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n21\n\n4.2.

Derived category of Hn,m -modules and Hochschild homology\n5.1. A quick review of derived categories of modules.\n5.1.1. Projective resolution formula. For a (graded) ring R, Db (R) denotes the bounded\nderived category of (graded) R-modules, R-pr denotes the category of (graded) projective\nmodules of R, while Kbpr (R) and K\u2212\npr (R) denote the bounded and bounded from above homotopy categories of (graded) projective R-modules.

Denote Re = R \u2297 Rop and define a projective resolution of R as Re -module to be a\ncomplex of Re -modules\nP(R) = (* * * \u2192 P(R)\u22122 \u2192 P(R)\u22121 \u2192 P(R)0 )\nwith a homomorphism P(R)0 \u2192 R such that the total complex * * * \u2192 P(R)\u22121 \u2192 P(R)0 \u2192 R\nis acyclic.

However, its restriction Psp to complexes of semi-projective\nmodules has a simpler expression, because it is sufficient to tensor with a projective resolution\nof one of two rings:\nPsp = P(R1 ) \u2297R1 \u2212 = \u2212 \u2297R2 P(R2 ).\n\n(5.4)\n\n5.1.3.

The following is easy to prove:\nTheorem 5.1 ([Kho02]). For any TL (2n, 2m)-tangle \u03bb, the Hn,m-module hh\u03bbiiK is semiprojective with possible degree shift and, consequently, the image of the functor FK lies within\nKbsp (Hn,m ).\nThe next theorem strengthens this result for split TL tangles:\n\n\fA CATEGORIFICATION OF THE STABLE SU(2) WRT INVARIANT OF LINKS IN S2 \u00d7 S1\n\n29\n\nTheorem 5.2 ([Kho02]).
