We statistically test this data for consistency with rates extrapolated from information on\nbone cancer in modern vertebrates, and find that there is no evidence of a different rate. Thus, this test\nprovides no support for a possible role of ionizing radiation in the K-T extinction event.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nCancer is one of the few diseases that can be reliably diagnosed in vertebrate remains (Rothschild and\nMartin 2006). Cancer prevalence may potentially help shed light on biosphere stress. Some scenarios for\nbiodiversity fluctuation and mass extinctions include radiation effects, which might increase the cancer rate\n(e.g. Medvedev and Melott 2007). Since dinosaurs were involved in a major mass extinction, it is\ninteresting to see whether there is any evidence of an elevated cancer rate.\nWhile primary bone cancer can be defined as cancer that begins in the bone, secondary or metastatic bone\ncancer is cancer that originates elsewhere in the body and spreads to the bone. Bone is the third most\ncommon site for metastasis after lung and liver (Alvarez 1948; Abrams, Spiro and Goldstein 1950;\nWierman, Clagett and McDonald 1954; Resnick 2002). Whereas a variety of cancers can spread to the\nbone, the most common forms in humans are breast, prostate, lung, kidney and thyroid (American Cancer\nSociety 2007). In this study, the prevalence of secondary bone cancer in dinosaurs is examined for\nconsistency with rates in modern vertebrates.\nWhile 2-3% benign hemangiomas (proliferation of vascular endothelium) were found in the family\nHadrosauridae, only one case of metastatic cancer was found (within the same family). The diseased\nvertebra was that of an Edmontosaurus (Rothschild et al. 2003) specimen from the Maastrichtian stage. It is\nparticularly interesting that this case came from near the end-Cretaceous, when the extinction event took\nplace. We note that the elevated rate of hemangiomas was also Maastrichtian, which is interesting, but we\nhave not studied this question since it cannot be excluded that, for example, it is a consequence of the diet\nor some other peculiarity of this family. The focus of our study is to do a statistical test for consistency\nbetween the rates in dinosaurs versus modern vertebrates.\n\nDATA AND METHODS\nIn order to test for consistency, we need to establish an expected rate based on data from modern\nvertebrates, and then ask whether the event in the dinosaur fossil record is consistent with that rate.\nWhile the spine is the most commonly affected area of bone metastasis in the human skeleton, the next\nmost common areas of spread include the ilium, pubis, ischium, proximal femur, femora and skull\n(American Cancer Society 2007). Thus, if a more comprehensive study is to be performed, examination of\nthese regions is suggested. Furthermore, as suggested by Rothschild and Rothschild (1995), visual\nexamination is complementary to radiologic examination and therefore should be included if the\nepidemiology of metastatic disease is to be determined reliably. However, the radiologic method alone was\nthe basis of the sample and control rate estimates used in this study.\n\n\fThe prevalence of bone cancer in human skeletons was examined. We justify the comparison based on a\nsuperficial similarity of large vertebrates with substantial life spans (Erickson et al. 2006). The rate of bone\nmetastasis was estimated with respect to x-ray identified metastatic disease in the Hamann-Todd Collection\n(Rothschild and Rothschild 1995).\nThe Hamann-Todd Collection is the largest and best preserved compilation of human skeletons for which a\nbackground demographic is known (Rothschild and Woods 1991; Rothschild and Martin 1993). From a\ntotal of 2906 defleshed skeletons, 33 cases of metastatic disease were identified fluoroscopically, yielding a\nprobability of 1.14 %. Based on necropsy results of captive wild animals (Effron, Griner and Benirschke\n1977), the rate of cancer in reptiles is approximately 1/8th that found in humans. Thus, the rate of cancer in\ndinosaurs can be tested for consistency with a rate of 0.142%.\nAnother estimate can be made based on the rate in birds. The rate of macroscopically observable cancer in\nbirds was less than 24 in 50,000 (Rothschild and Panza 2005), indicating that the rate of cancer in dinosaurs\ncan be tested for consistency with 0.048%. The Poisson distribution was subsequently applied to both rates\nin order to calculate probability. Our null hypothesis is that the rate of such cancer in dinosaurs is not\nhigher than either of these rates.\nThe data concerning the prevalence of cancer in the fossil record was presented in Rothschild et al. (2003).\nThe epidemiology of tumors in dinosaurs was investigated by fluoroscopically screening dinosaur\nvertebrae, a technique which allowed the examination of vertebrae in real time, thus negating the need for\nfilm. A total of 10,312 vertebrae from 708 individual dinosaurs of varying families were examined, and\none such tumor was found.\nRESULTS\nThe malignant Edmontosaurus tumor reported by Rothschild et al. (2003) is metastatic cancer of unknown\n(primary) origin. In the table below, we show the probability of finding various numbers of subjects with\ntumors (left column) in a sample of 708 examined, assuming the rate for reptiles (center column) and birds\n(right column) It was determined that the rate of metastatic bone disease in the dinosaur fossil record is in\nfact consistent with the predicted rate of bone metastasis in the dinosaur record (Table 1). The probability\nof finding less than one cancer is 37% according to the reptilian cancer rate, and 71% according to the\navian rate, so the observed event does not represent an elevated rate. We cannot negate the null hypothesis.\nThus, there does not appear to be an elevated rate of bone cancer in the dinosaur fossil record. Note that if\nthe null hypothesis had been formulated as \"not lower rate\", we would not be able to reject that either,\nbased on the size of the sample and the expected rates.\n\n\fDinosaurs (708)\n# with cancer\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\nReptiles\nProbability\n0.36605\n0.36787\n0.18486\n0.06193\n0.01556\n0.00313\n0.00052\n0.00008\n0.00001\n\nBirds\nProbability\n0.71188\n0.24193\n0.04111\n0.00466\n0.00040\n0.00003\n0.00000\n0.00000\n0.00000\n\nTable 1 Examination of vertebrae from 708 dinosaurs\nrevealed 1 case of metastatic disease. Thus, the\nfrequency of metastatic bone cancer is consistent with\nthe risk estimated from rates in modern vertebrates, as\ndetermined using the Poisson distribution.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have asked whether the bone cancer rate in dinosaurs is consistent with rates for modern vertebrates.\nResults of past examination of dinosaur fossil bones for evidence of metastatic bone cancer are tested for\nconsistency with available information on rates in modern vertebrates. We were able to make two rate\nestimates, not more than a factor of three apart, based on available data. We then ask about the probability\nof finding one bone cancer in 708 dinosaurs based on these assumed rates. We find that with either rate,\nthis is not an unexpected outcome. We conclude that there is no evidence for an abnormal rate of bone\ncancer in dinosaurs.\nExposure to ionizing radiation can elevate the rate of bone cancers (Brenner et al. 2003). A variety of\nastrophysical sources of such radiation have been hypothesized to have a role in extinction events (e.g.\nFields 2004; Medvedev and Melott 2007). It is therefore interesting to ask whether there is evidence for an\nelevated cancer rate as a possible signal for a role in ionizing radiation. The answer is no. There is however,\na residual question of a somewhat elevated rate of benign hemangiomas in the family Hadrosauridae which\nis outside the scope of this study, but may deserve further consideration in the future.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis research was supported by NASA Astrobiology: Exobiology and Evolutionary Biology grant\nNNG04GM14G, the University of Kansas Honors Program, and by the KU Student Senate.\n\n\fLITERATURE CITED\nAbrams, H.L., Spiro, R., Goldstein, N. 1950.
