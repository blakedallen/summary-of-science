The first proposed scenario of elliptical formation\nwas the so-called monolithic collapse scenario (e.g. Larson, 1974). In this framework, ellipticals are assumed to have formed at high redshift as a result of a rapid\ncollapse of a gas cloud. This gas is then rapidly converted into stars by means of\na very strong burst, followed by a galactic wind powered by the energy injected\ninto the interstellar medium (ISM) by supernovae (SNe) and stellar winds. The\nwind carries out the residual gas from the galaxies, thus inhibiting further star\nformation. In this way the mass-metallicity (i.e. more massive a galaxies have\nthe higher metal content in stars and gas) relation could be easily explained\nin terms of metallicity sequences, namely the more massive objects develop the\nwind later (due to their deeper potential wells) and, thus, have more time to\nenrich their stellar generations. This scenario has been recently reviewed and\nmodified by Pipino & Matteucci (2004, PM04) in order to take into account\nthat ellipticals show an increasing Mg/Fe abundance ratio in the stars as a\nfunction of galactic mass (Faber et al. 1992). Due to the different nucleosynthesis leading to the production of Mg (by type II SNe, on short timescales)\nand Fe (by type Ia SNe, on longer timescale), the Mg/Fe-mass relation implies\nthat the more massive objects should have formed faster than the less massive\nones (see Matteucci, this book, and references therein). Pipino & Matteucci\n(2004) implemented an infall term in the chemical evolution equation in order\nto simulate the creation of galaxies and found that most of the photo-chemical\nobservables, including the Mg/Fe-mass relation can be reproduced in a scenario\nin which the more massive galaxies formed faster and with a much more efficient\nstar formation process with respect to the low mass objects.\nPM04 suggested that a single galaxy should form outside-in, namely the\noutermost regions form earlier and faster with respect to the central parts. A\nnatural consequence of this model and of the time-delay between the production\nof Fe and that of Mg is that the mean [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio in the stars\nshould increase with radius. Pipino et al. (2006, PMC06) compared PM04\nbest model results with the very recent observations for the galaxy NGC 4697\n(Mendez et al. 2005), and found them in excellent agreement.\nMetallicity gradients, in fact, are characteristic of the stellar populations\ninside elliptical galaxies. Evidences come from the increase of line-strength indices (e.g. Carollo et al., 1993; Davies et al., 1993; Trager et al., 2000) and\nthe reddening of the colours (e.g. Peletier et al. 1990) towards the centre of\nthe galaxies. The study of such gradients provide insights into the mechanism\nof galaxy formation, particularly on the duration of the chemical enrichment\nprocess at each radius. Metallicity indices, in fact, contain information on the\n2\n\n\fchemical composition and the age of the simple stellar populations (SSPs) inhabiting a given galactic zone.\n\n0.2\n\nThe model\n\nThe chemical code adopted here is described in full detail in PM04 and PMC06,\nwhere we address the reader for more details. This model is characterized by:\nSalpeter (1955) IMF, Thielemann et al. (1996) yields for massive stars, Nomoto\net al. (1997) yields for type Ia SNe and van den Hoek & Groenewegen (1997)\nyields for low- and intermediate-mass stars (the case with \u03b7AGB varying with\nmetallicity). Here we present our analysis of a \u223c 1011 M\u2299 galaxy (PM04 model\nIIb), considered representative of a typical elliptical, unless otherwise stated.\nThe model assumes that the galaxy assembles by merging of gaseous lumps\n(infall) on a short timescale and suffers a strong star burst which injects into the\ninterstellar medium a large amount of energy able to trigger a galactic wind,\noccurring at different times at different radii. After the development of the\nwind, the star formation is assumed to stop and the galaxy evolves passively\nwith continuous mass loss.\n\n0.3\n0.3.1\n\nResults and discussion\nThe mass-metallicity relation evolution\n\nFrom the comparison between our model predictions (Fig. 1) and the observed\nstellar metallicity distribution diagrams derived at different radii by Harris &\nHarris (2002, see their fig. 18) for the elliptical galaxy NGC 5128, we can derive\nsome general considerations. The qualitative agreement is remarkable: we can\nexplain the slow rise in the [Z/H]-distribution as the effect of the infall, whereas\nthe sharp truncation at high metallicities is the first direct evidence of a sudden\nand strong wind which stopped the star formation. The suggested outside-in\nformation process reflects in a more asymmetric shape of the stellar metallicity\ndistribution diagram at larger radii, where the galactic wind occurs earlier (i.e.\ncloser to the peak of the star formation rate), with respect to the galactic centre.\nFrom a quantitative point of view, properties suchs as the stellar metallicity\ndistribution of the composite stellar populations (CSPs) inhabiting the galactic core, allow us to study the build-up of mass-metallicity relation, which is\ntipically inferred from the spectra taken at \u223c 0.1 effective radius. In Fig. 2 we\nplot the time evolution of the mass-metalliticity relation in stars (which reflect\nthe average chemical enrichment of the galactic core as seen at the present day;\ndashed line) and in the gas (which, instead, is closer to the composition of the\nyoungest SSP, thus being more indicative of a high redshift object; solid line).\nThe mean Fe abundance in the stellar component can reach the solar value\nin only 0.5 Gyr, making ellipticals among the most metal-rich objects of the\n3\n\n\fFigure 1: Stellar metallicity distribution distributions for [Z/H] in luminosity\n(solid line) and mass (dotted line). Upper panel : values at 0.1Ref f . Lower\npanel : values at 1Ref f . The plots are presented in the same scale in order to\nbetter appreciate the differences among the different distributions.\n\n4\n\n\funiverse. FOr the star formation histories of these objects see Matteucci (this\nbook). For the metals locked-up in dust we refer the reader to Calura, Pipino\n& Matteucci (2007) and Calura (??, this book).\nIt is intriguing that the Lyman-Break Galaxies observed by Verma et al.\n(2007) at a redshift of 5 have assembled probably less than 1/10 of their final\nmass in stars (at a rate of \u223c 40M\u2299 /yr), they have an average age which is\nlower than 100 Myr and an inferred gas metallicity below Z = 0.01 Z\u2299 . Their\nfinding is in remarkable agreement with our expectations for a present-day elliptical caught in the act of the build-up of the low-metallicity tail of the stellar\nmetallicity distribution curve at very high redshift.\nOn the other hand, at variance with the stellar metallicity distribution diagrams as a function of [Z/H] (and [Fe/H]), abundance ratios such as [\u03b1/Fe] have\nnarrow and almost symmetric distributions. This means that, also from a mathematical point of view, the [< \u03b1/F e >] ratio are representative of the whole\nCSP (PMC06). The robustness of the [\u03b1/Fe] ratios as constraints for the galactic formation history is testified by the fact that [< \u03b1/Fe >] \u2243 [< \u03b1/Fe >V ],\nhaving very similar distributions. In particular, we find that the skewness parameter is much larger for the [Z/H] and [Fe/H] distributions than for the case\nof the [\u03b1/Fe] one, by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, the asymmetry increases going to large radii (see Fig. 1, lower panel), up to a factor of\n\u223c7 with respect to the inner regions. Therefore, it is not surprising that the\n[< Z/H >] value does not represent the galaxy at large radii, and hence, we\nstress that care should be taken when one wants to infer the real abundances of\nthe stellar components for a galaxy by comparing the observed indices (related\nto a CSP) with the theoretical ones (predicted for a SSP). Only the comparison\nbased on the [< \u03b1/Fe >] ratios seems to be robust.\nAnother possible source of discrepancies is the fact that luminosity-weighted\naverages (which are more closely related to the observed indices) and massweighted averages (which represent the real distributions of the chemical elements in the stellar populations) might differ more in the most external zones of\nthe galaxy (compare the panels in Fig. 1). All these considerations result in the\nfact that the chemical abundance pattern used by modellers to build their SSPs,\nmight not necessary reflect the real trends. Therefore, the interpretation of line\nstrenght indices in terms of abundances, can be seriously flawed (see PMC06\nfor further details). We refer to Pipino et al. (2007b, see also ?? ,this book)\nwhere, the build-up of the metallicity gradients is thorougly studied.\n\n0.3.2\n\nGlobular cluster systems in ellipticals: a different\npoint of view\n\nThe analysis of the radial variation in the CSPs inhabiting elliptical galaxies\nseems to be promising as a powerful tool to study ellipticals. Pipino, Puzia &\nMatteucci (2007), make use of the stellar metallicity distributions predicted by\nPMC06 to explain the multimodality in the globular cluster (GC) metallicity\n5\n\n\fFigure 2: The temporal evolution of mass-metallicity relation for the two studied\ngalactic components (stars and gas).\ndistribution as well as their high \u03b1 enhancement (Puzia et al. 2006, P06). In\nparticular, they show that the GC distribution as function of [Fe/H] for the\nwhole galaxy can be constructed simply by combining distributions as those\nof Fig. 1 (typical of different radii), once they had been rescale by means of a\nsuitable function (of time and metallicity) which links the global star formation\nrate to the globular cluster creation.\nIn order to plot the different cases on the same scale we normalize each\nGC-metalliticy distribution function by its maximum value. In the upper panel\nof Figure 3 the shaded histogram represents the innermost population. Our\npredictions match the data very well, especially in the metal-rich slope and the\nmean of the distribution. The same happens for the pure core populations,\nwhich shows how the GCS might be used to probe the CSP in ellipticals. It\nshould be remarked that a second peak centered at super-solar metallicity appears in the distribution predicted by our models, although not evident in the\ndata of the particular radial sub-sample. The lower panel of Figure 3 illustrates model predictions which are more representative of the galaxy as a whole\n(either at 1Reff , i.e. the intermediate population, or at several effective radii,\nthe outermost population), and we consider them as the fiducial case. These\ntwo cases look quite similar to each other and have clear signs of bimodality in\nremarkable agreement with the spectroscopic data (solid empty histogram, subsample of the P06 data with r \u2265 Reff ). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test returns\n> 99% probability that both model predictions and observations are drawn from\nthe same parent distribution in the upper panel of Figure 3. The lower panel\nstatistics gives a lower likelihood of 98.4% that both distributions have the same\n\n6\n\n\forigin, which is mainly due to the observed excess of metal-poor GCs at large\ngalactocentric radii compared to the model predictions. The prediction of a\nsuper-solar metallicity globular cluster sub-population is entirely new and a result of the radially varying and violent formation of the parent galaxy. Moving\nto the low-metallicity tail, we predict slightly fewer low metallicity objects than\nexpected from observations , which is attributed to the lack of GC accretion\nfrom metal-poor satellite galaxies in our model.\nIn Figure 4 (upper panel) we show the results for a pure core GCs, namely\none in which we adopt fred : fblue = 1 : 0. In this quite extreme case the observed\nGCs have been selected with radius r < 0.5Reff . The histogram reflects the\nshape of a stellar metallicity distribution diagram expected for a typical CSP\ninhabiting the galactic core. This finding is particularly important, because it\nmight offer the opportunity to resolve the SSPs in ellipticals, at variance with\ndata coming from the integrated spectra which deal with luminosity-weighted\nquantities. Whereas in Figure 4 (lower panel), the intermediate population is\ncompared to a sub-sample of P06 GCs with 0.5 < r < 1.5Reff . This is to show\nthat the multimodality is not an artifact due to the particular radial binning\nadopted in this paper.\nSince the GC populations trace the properties of galactic CSPs in our scenario, we predict an increase of the mean metallicity of the cluster systems with\nthe host galaxy mass, which closely follows the mass-metallicity relation for ellipticals.This has been observed in the GCSs of Virgo cluster early-type galaxies\n(Peng et al. 2006, ApJ 639, 95). Moreover, we expect that a major fraction\nof the GCs (i.e. those born inside the galaxy) follows an age-metalliticity relationship, in the sense that the older ones are also more \u03b1-enhanced and more\nmetal-poor.\nNeither a need of an enhanced GC formation during mergers nor a strong\nrole of the accretion of exteranl objects, seems to be required in order to explain\nthe different features of the GC metallicity distributions. Since globular clusters\nare the closest approximation of a SSP, we expect that this technique will be\nvery helpful to probe the properties of the stellar populations in spheroids,\nthus avoiding the uncertainties typical of the analysis based on their integrated\nspectra.\n\n0.4\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nA detailed study of the chemical properties of the CSPs inhabiting elliptical\ngalaxies as well as the change of their properties as a function of both time and\nradius, allow us to gather a wealth of information. Our main conclusions are:\n\u2022 Both observed and predicted stellar metallicity distribution for ellipticals\nshow a sharp truncation at high metallicities that, in the light of our\nmodels, might be interpreted as the first direct evidence for the occurrence\nof the galactic wind in spheroids.\n7\n\n\fFigure 3: Predicted globular-cluster metallicity distribution by mass as a function of [Z/H] for three different radial compositions.

Solid empty histograms:\nobservational data taken as sub-samples of the P06 compilation, according to\nthe galactic regions presented in each panel.\n\n9\n\n\f\u2022 The stellar component of the most massive and luminous galaxies might\nattain a metallicity Z \u2265 Z\u2299 in only 0.5 Gyr.\n\u2022 PM04's best model prediction of increasing [< \u03b1/Fe >] ratio with radius\nis in very good agreement with the observed gradient in [\u03b1/Fe] of NGC\n4697. This strongly suggests an outside-in galaxy formation scenario for\nelliptical galaxies that show strong gradients (see also Pipino et al. 2007b\nand ??, this book).\n\u2022 By comparing the radial trend of [< Z/H >] with the observed one, we\nnotice a discrepancy which is due to the fact that a CSP behaves in a\ndifferent way with respect to a SSP. In particular the predicted gradient\nof [< Z/H >] is flatter than the observed one at large radii. Therefore,\nthis should be taken into account when estimates for the metallicity of a\ngalaxy are derived from the simple comparison between the observed linestrength index and the predictions for a SSP, a method currently adopted\nin the literature.\n\u2022 Abundance ratios such as [Mg/Fe] are less affected by the discrepancy between the SSPs and a CSP, since their distribution functions are narrower\nand more symmetric. Therefore, we stress the importance of such a ratio\nas the most robust tool to estimate the duration of the galaxy formation\nprocess.\n\u2022 We show that the observed multi-modality in the globular cluster metallicity distributions can be, at least partly, ascribed to the radial variation\nin the underlying stellar populations in giant elliptical galaxies. In particular, the observed globular cluster systems are consistent with a linear\ncombination of the globular cluster sub-populations inhabiting different\ngalactocentric radii projected on the sky.\n\u2022 A new prediction of our models, which is in astonishing agreement with\nthe spectroscopic observations, is the presence of a super-solar metallicity\nmode that seems to emerge in the most massive elliptical galaxies. In\nsmaller objects, instead, this mode disappears quickly with decreasing\nstellar mass of the host galaxy.\n\u2022 Since in our scenario the GCs properties sample the galactic CSPs, we\npredict an increase of the mean metallicity and mean [\u03b1/F e] of cluster\nsystems with the host galaxy mass, which closely follows the scaling relations for ellipticals. Moreover, we expect that a major fraction of the\nGCs (i.e. those born inside the galaxy) follows an age-metalliticity relationship, in the sense that the older ones are also more \u03b1-enhanced and\nmore metal-poor.\nA.P. thanks the Organizers for having provided financial support for attending the conference.\n10\n\n\fBibliography\n[]\n\nCalura, F., Pipino, A., & Matteucci, F. 2007, A&A, arXiv:0706.2197\n\n[]\n\nCarollo, C.M., Danziger, I.J., & Buson, L. 1993, MNRAS, 265, 553\n\n[]\n\nDavies, R.L., Sadler, E.M., & Peletier, R.F., 1993, MNRAS, 262, 650\n\n[]\n\nFaber, S.M., Worthey, G., & Gonzalez, J.J. 1992, in IAU Symp. n.149, eds.\nB.
