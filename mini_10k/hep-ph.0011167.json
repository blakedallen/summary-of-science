Present estimations of proton-proton total cross sections at very high energies are obtained from cosmic rays (> 1017 eV) by means of some approximations\nand the knowledge of the measured proton-air cross section at these energies. Besides,\ntotal cross sections are measured with present day high energy colliders up to nearly 2\nTeV in the center of mass (\u223c 1015 eV in the laboratory). Here we use a phenomenological model based on the Multiple-Diffraction approach to succesfully describe data\nat accelerator energies. Then we estimate with it proton-proton total cross sections\nat cosmic ray energies. On the basis of a forecasting regression analysis we determine\nconfident error bands, analyzing the sensitivity of our predictions to the employed data\nfor extrapolation.\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\nRecently a number of difficulties in uniting accelerator and cosmic ray values of\nhadronic cross-sections within the frame of the highest up-to-date data have been\nsummarized [1]. Such united picture appears to be highly important for at least,\nthe interpretation of results of new cosmic ray experiments, as the HiRes [2] and\nin designing proposals that are currently in progress, as the Auger Observatory [3],\nas well as in designing detectors for future accelerators, as the CERN pp Large\np\u0304p\nHadron Collider (LHC). Although\nmost of accelerator measurements of \u03c3tot\nand\n\u221a\npp\n\u03c3tot\nat center of mass energy s \u2264 1.8 TeV are quite consistent\namong\nthem,\nthis\n\u221a\nis unfortunately not the case for cosmic ray experiments at s > 6 TeV where\nsome disagreements exist among different experiments. This is also the case among\ndifferent predictions from the extrapolation of accelerator data up to cosmic ray\npp\nenergies: whereas some works predict smaller values of \u03c3tot\nthan those of cosmic ray\nexperiments (e.g. [4,5]) other predictions agree at some specific energies with cosmic ray results (e.g. [6,10]). Dispersion of cosmic ray results are mainly associated\nto the strong model-dependence of the relation between the basic hadron-hadron\ncross-section and the hadronic cross-section in air. The later determines the attenuation lenght of hadrons in the atmosphere, which is usually measured in different\nways, and depends strongly on the rate (k) of energy dissipation of the primary\nproton into the electromagnetic shower observed in the experiment: such a cascade\nis simulated by different Monte Carlo techniques implying additional discrepanpp\ncies between different experiments. Furthermore, \u03c3tot\nin cosmic ray experiments\ninel\nis determined from \u03c3p\u2212air using a nucleon-nucleon scattering amplitude which is\nfrequently in disagreement with most of accelerator data [1]. On the other hand,\nwe dispose of parameterizations (purely theoretically, empirical or semi-empirical\nbased) that fit pretty well the accelerator data. Most of them agree that at the\nenergy of the LHC (14 TeV in the center of mass) or higher (extrapolations) the\npp\nwill continue, though the predicted values differ from model\nrise in energy of \u03c3tot\nto model. We claim that both the cosmic ray and parameterization approaches\nmust complement each other in order to draw the best description of the hadronic\ncross-section behavior at ultra high energies. However, the present status is that\ndue to the fact that interpolation of accelerator data is nicely obtained with most of\nparameterization models, it is expected that their extrapolation to higher energies\nbe highly confident: as a matter of fact, parameterizations are usually based in a\nshort number of fundamental parameters, in contrast with the difficulties found in\npp\nderiving \u03c3tot\nfrom cosmic ray results [1]. If extrapolation from parameterization\ninel\nshould be smaller, which would have\nmodels is correct this would imply that \u03c3p\u2212air\nimportant consequences for development of high energy cascades.\nWith the aim of contributing to the understanding of this problem, in this paper\nwe first briefly analyze in the first two sections the way estimations are done for\nproton-proton total cross sections from accelerators as well as from cosmic rays.\n\n\fWe find serious discrepancies among both estimations. In the third section, on the\nbasis of the Multiple Diffraction model applied to accelerator data, we predict pp\ntotal cross section values with smaller errors than with the standard techniques.\nWe conclude with a discussion about the quality of present cosmic ray estimations.\n\nI\n\npp\nHADRONIC \u03c3tot\nFROM ACCELERATORS\n\nSince the first results of the Intersecting Storage Rings(ISR) at CERN arrived\npp\nin the 70s, it is a well established fact that \u03c3tot\nrises with energy ( [11,12]). The\np\u0304p\nCERN S p\u0304pS Collider found this rising valid for \u03c3tot as well [14]. Later, the Tevatron\np\u0304p\nconfirmed that for \u03c3tot\nthe rising still continues at 1.8 TeV, even if there is a\ndisagreement among the diferent experiment values as for the exact value ( [15,16]).\nA thoroughful discussion on these problems may be found in [17,18]. It remains\nnow to estimate the amount of rising of the total cross section at those energies.\nLet us resume the standard technique used by accelerator experimentalists [5].\nUsing a semi-empirical parameterization based on Regge theory and asymptotic\ntheorems experimentalists have succesively described their data from the ISR to\npp\np\u0304p\nthe S p\u0304pS energies. It takes into account all the available data for \u03c3tot\n, \u03c1pp , \u03c3tot\nand\n\u03c1p\u0304p , where \u03c1pp,p\u0304p , is the real part of the (pp, p\u0304p) forward elastic amplitude at t = 0.\nThe fits are performed using the once-subtracted dispersion relations:\nCs\nE\n\u03c1\u00b1 (E)\u03c3\u00b1 (E) =\n+\np\n\u03c0p\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nm\n\n\"\n\n\u03c3\u00b1 (E \u2032 )\n\u03c3\u2213 (E \u2032 )\ndE p\n\u2212\nE \u2032 (E \u2032 \u2212 E) E \u2032 (E \u2032 + E)\n\u2032 \u2032\n\n#\n\n(1)\n\npp,p\u0304p\nwhere Cs is the substraction constant. The expression for \u03c3tot\nis:\ntot\n\u03c3\u2212,+\n= A1 E \u2212N1 \u00b1 A2 E \u2212N2 + C0 + C2 [ln(s/s0 )]\u03b3\n\n(2)\n\nwhere - (+) stands for pp (p\u0304p) scattering. Cross sections are measured in mb\nand energy in GeV, E being the energy measured in the lab frame. The scale\nfactor s0 have been arbitrarily chosen equal to 1 GeV2 . The most interesting\npiece is the one controling the high-energy behaviour, given by a ln2 (s) term, in\norder to be compatible, asymptotically, with the Froissart-Martin bound [19]. The\npp\np\u0304p\nparameterization assumes \u03c3tot\nand \u03c3tot\nto be the same asymptotically. This is\njustified from the very precise measurement of the \u03c1 parameter at 546 GeV [28].\nThe eight free parameters are determined by a fit which minimizes the \u03c72 function\n\u03c72 = \u03c72\u03c3p\u0304p + \u03c72\u03c1p\u0304p + +\u03c72\u03c3pp + \u03c72\u03c1pp\n\n(3)\n\nThe fit has proved its validity predicting from the ISR data (ranging from 23 to 63\np\u0304p\nvalue later found at the S p\u0304pS Collider, one\nGeV in the center of mass), the \u03c3tot\norder of magnitude higher in energy (546 GeV) [13,14]. With the same well-known\ntechnique and using the most recent results it is possible to get estimations for\npp\n\u03c3tot\nat the LHC and higher energies. These estimations, together with our present\n\n\fp\u0304p\nTABLE 1. \u03c3tot\ndata from high\nenergy accelerators: fits values are\nfrom [5].\n\u221a\npp\n(mb)\ns (TeV)\n\u03c3tot\n0.55\nFit\n61.8 \u00b1 0.7\nUA4\n62.2 \u00b1 1.5\nCDF\n61.5 \u00b1 1.0\n1.8\nFit\n76.5 \u00b1 2.3\nE710\n72.8 \u00b1 3.1\nCDF\n80.6 \u00b1 2.3\n14\nFit\n109.0 \u00b1 8.0\n30\nFit\n126.0 \u00b1 11.0\n40\nFit\n130.0 \u00b1 13.0\n\npp\np\u0304p\nexperimental knowledge for both \u03c3tot\nand \u03c3tot\nare plotted in figure 1.

It should be remarked that at the LHC\nenergies and beyond the fitting results display relatively high error values, equal or\nbigger than 8 mb.

But, as summarized in [1] and\npp\nwidely discussed in the literature, the determination of \u03c3tot\nis a rather complicated\nprocess with at least two well differentiated steps. In the first place, the primary\ninteraction involved in EAS is proton-air; what it is determined through EAS is\np\u2212air\nthe p-inelastic cross section, \u03c3inel\n, through some measure of the attenuation of\nthe rate of showers, \u039bm , deep in the atmosphere:\n\n\u039bm = k\u03bbp\u2212air = k\n\n14.5mp\np\u2212air\n\u03c3inel\n\n(4)\n\nThe k factor parameterizes the rate at which the energy of the primary proton\nis dissipated into electromagnetic energy. A simulation with a full representation\nof the hadronic interactions in the cascade is needed to calculate it. This is done\nby means of Monte Carlo techniques [20\u201322]. Secondly, the connection between\np\u2212air\npp\n\u03c3inel\nand \u03c3tot\nis model dependent. A theory for nuclei interactions must be used.\nUsually is Glauber's theory [7,8]. The whole procedure makes hard to get a general\npp\n. Depending on the particular assumptions made the values\nagreed value for \u03c3tot\nmay oscillate by large amounts, \u221a\nfrom as low to 133 \u00b1 10 mb [23] to nearly 165 \u00b1 5\ns = 40 TeV.\nmb [26] and even 175+40\n[27]\nat\n\u221227\npp\n\u00bfFrom this analysis the conclusion is that cosmic-ray estimations of \u03c3tot\nare not\nof much help to constrain extrapolations from accelerator energies [1]. Conversely\nwe could ask if those extrapolations could not be used to constrain cosmic-rays\nestimations.\n\nIII\n\npp\nA MULTIPLE-DIFFRACTION APPROACH FOR \u03c3tot\n\nLet us tackle the mismatching between accelerator and cosmic ray estimations\nusing the multiple-diffraction model [9]. The elastic hadronic scattering amplitude\nfor the collision of two hadrons A and B is described as\nF (q, s) = i\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nh\n\ni\n\nb db 1 \u2212 ei\u039e(b,s) Jo (qb)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u039e(b, s) is the eikonal, b the impact parameter, Jo the zero-order Bessel function and q 2 = \u2212t the four-momentum transfer squared. The eikonal can be expressed at first order as \u039e(b, s) = hGA GB f i, where GA and GB are the hadronic\nform factors, f the averaged elementary amplitude among the constituent partons\nand the brackets denote the symmetrical two-dimensional Fourier transform. Given\npp\nthe elastic amplitude F (q, s), \u03c3tot\nmay be evaluated with the help of the optical\ntheorem:\npp\n\u03c3tot\n= 4 \u03c0 ImF (q = 0, s)\n\n(6)\n\n\fMultiple-diffraction models differ one from another by the particular choice of parameterizations made for GA and GB and the elementary amplitude f . In the case\nof identical particles, as is our case, GA = GB = G. For our purposes we follow the\nparameterization developed in [10] which has the advantage of using a small set of\nfree parameters, five in total: two of them (\u03b12 , \u03b2 2) associated with the form factor\nG\nG = (1 +\n\nq 2 \u22121\nq 2 \u22121\n)\n(1\n+\n)\n\u03b12\n\u03b22\n\n(7)\n\nand three energy-dependent parameters (C, a, \u03bb) associated with the elementary\ncomplex amplitude f\nf (q, s) = Ref (q, s) + iImf (q, s)\n\nImf (q, s) = C\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\u2212\n\nq2\na2\nq4\na4\n\n(8)\n\n; Ref (q, s) = \u03bb(s)Imf (q, s)\n\n(9)\n\nWe get\nImF (q = 0, s) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\nh\n\ni\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a9(b,s) cos {\u03bb\u03a9(b, s)} b db Jo (q, b)\n\n(10)\n\nwith the opacity \u03a9(b, s) given as:\n\u03a9(b, s) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\no\n\nG2 Imf (q, s) Jo (q, b) qdq\n\n\u03a9(b, s) = C{E1 K0 (\u03b1b) + E2 K0 (\u03b2b) + E3 Kei (ab) +\nE4 Ker (ab) + b [E5 K1 (\u03b1b) + E6 K1 (\u03b2b)] }\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere k0 , k1 , kei , and ker are the modified Bessel functions, and E1 to E6 are functions of the free parameters. The proton-proton total cross-section is directly determined by the expression\npp\n\u03c3tot\n\n= 4\u03c0\n\nZ\n\no\n\n\u221e\n\nn\n\nb db 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03a9(b,s) cos [\u03bb\u03a9(b, s)]\n\no\n\nJo (q, b)\n\n(13)\n\nThis equation was numerically solved. The overall procedure is done in a three step\nprocess.\n\u2022 First, we determine the parameters of the model by fitting all the pp as well\nas p\u0304p accelerator\n\u221a data (differential elastic cross sections and \u03c1 values). in the\ninterval 13.8 \u2264 s \u2264 1800 GeV. The obtained values are listed in Table 2.\n\n\f\u2022 Secondly, and most important, we estimate an error band for each of the\nenergy-dependent parameters. To this end we introduce the so-called forecasting technique, based on the multiple linear regression theory. It consists\nin determining a prediction equation por each free parameter. This allows\nto set a confidence band for each parameter and the confidence band for the\npredicted total cross section. The technique is explained in detail elsewhere\n[29].\n\u2022 Finally, we proceed to extrapolate our results to high energies. Results are\nsummarized in Table 3a and plotted in figure 2b, together with cosmic ray\ndata. As a comparison, we list in Table 3b the extrapolated values\u221aobtained\nwhen only pp data, covering a much smaller t-range interval (13.8 \u2264 s \u2264 62.5\nGeV), was used. This was the method in [10], but their extrapolated values\nwere given without quoting any errors.\npp\np\u0304p\nIt may be argued that \u03c3tot\nand \u03c3tot\nare different at high energies: This is the \"Odderon hypothesis\", which as indicated in Section I, has been very much weakened\n[28]. Taking this into account, in our multiple-diffraction analysis it is assumed the\npp\np\u0304p\nsame behaviour for \u03c3tot\nand \u03c3tot\nat high energy.\n\u221a\nOf course, if we limit our fitting calculations to the accelerator domain s \u2264 62.5\nGeV (Table 3b), our results are the same as those obtained in [10]. In that case, the\npp\n\u03c3tot\nvalues obtained when extrapolated to ultra high energies seem to confirm the\nhighest quoted values of the cosmic ray experiments [26,27]. That would imply the\npp\nextrapolation cherished by experimentalists is wrong. But the prediction \u03c3tot\n= 91.6\nmb at the Fermilab Collider energy (1.8 TeV) is too high, first, and secondly,\ndifficult to interpret, as no error is quoted in that work. In Table 1 we see that the\npp\np\u0304p\nmeasured \u03c3tot\nat 546 GeV is smaller than the predicted \u03c3tot\nby near 8 mb, and in the\ncase of 1.8 TeV by more than 15 mb, which no available model is able to explain [18].\nAlso it can be noted that the extrapolation from figure 2a to ultra high energies\nmay claim agreement with the analysis carried out in [26] and the experimental\ndata of the Fly's Eye [27], and even with the Akeno collaboration [23], because its\nerrors are so big that overlap with the errors reported in [27]. That is, such an\nextrapolation, Fig.2a, produces an error band so large at cosmic ray energies that\nany cosmic ray results become compatible with results at accelerator energies, as\nit is claimed in [10]. However, when additional data at higher accelerator energies\nare included (Table 3b), both the predicted values and the error band obviously\nchange. This can be clearly seen in figure 2b, where we have considered data at\npp\n0.546 TeV and 1.8 TeV\nin which case the predicted value of \u03c3tot\nfrom\n\u221a (see Table 1) pp\n+4.8\nour extrapolation at s = 40 TeV, \u03c3tot = 131.7\u22124.6 mb is incompatible with those\nin [26,27] by several standard deviations, though no so different to the Akeno results\nand the predicted value in [5].\nConcerning the quoted error bands, the forecasting technique has reduced the\nerrors, as is seen in figure 2(b), nearly by a factor of 3, as compared with the results\nquoted in Table 1.\n\n\fTABLE 2.

In particularly, we show that\npp\nif we limit our study of\u221adetermining \u03c3tot\nat cosmic ray energies from extrapolation\nof accelerator data of s \u2264 62.5 GeV, then results are compatible with most of\ncosmic ray experiments and other prediction models, because the predicted error\nband is so wide that covers their corresponding error bands (Fig. 2a). However, as\nx the included data in our calculations extends to higher energies, that is, when all\npp\nexperimental available data is taken into account, the estimated values for \u03c3tot\nobtained from extrapolation and those obtained from cosmic ray experiments are only\ncompatible, within the error bars, with the Akeno results (Fig. 2b). It should be\nnoted that our predictions are compatibles with other prediction studies [5]. Taken\npp\nvalue, we\nall these convergences at face value, as indicating the most probable \u03c3tot\nconclude that if predictions from accelerator data are correct, hence, it should be\nof great help to normalize the corresponding values from cosmic ray experiments,\nas for instance by keeping the (k) parameter as a free one, as it is done for instance\nin [31]. The k value found will greatly help the tunning of the complicated Monte\nCarlo calculations used to evaluate the development of the showers induced by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere.
