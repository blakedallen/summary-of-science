This gave rise to the variance formulation of the\nuncertainty principle which remains a powerful source of\nintuition on the structure and spectral properties of microscopic systems. With the prospect of quantum computing and the development of quantum information theory in recent decades, on the other hand, the need for a\nmeasure of uncertainty that can better capture its information theoretical aspects, especially in dealing with\nnoncanonical observables, has inspired new formulations.\nAmong these are the entropic measure developed in the\neighties, and the majorization formulation proposed recently. Uncertainty relations resulting from these formulations have found application to quantum cryptography,\ninformation locking, and entanglement detection, in addition to providing uncertainty limits [2, 3].\nIn this paper we develop applications of the majorization formulation of uncertainty introduced in Ref. [3]\nto the problem of entanglement detection. Deciding\nwhether a given quantum state is entangled is a central\nproblem of quantum information theory and known to be\ncomputationally intractable in general [4]. As a result,\ncomputationally tractable necessary conditions for separability, which provide a partial solution to this prob-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: hpartovi@csus.edu\n\nlem, have been the subject of active research in recent\nyears. Among these, the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose criterion actually provides necessary and\nsufficient separability conditions for 2 \u2297 2 and 2 \u2297 3 dimensional systems, and necessary conditions otherwise.\nOther notable results are the reduction and global versus local disorder criteria, both necessary conditions in\ngeneral [5]. An observable that has non-negative expectation values for all separable states and negative ones\nfor a subset of entangled states provides an operational\nmethod of entanglement detection and is known as an\nentanglement witness [6]. It has also long been known\nthat uncertainty relations can serve a similar purpose by\nproviding inequalities that must be satisfied by separable\nstates and if violated signal entanglement [7, 8].\nIn this paper we extend the majorization formulation\nof uncertainty developed in Ref. [3] to the problem of entanglement detection. As discussed in that paper (hereafter referred to as Paper I) and in the following, majorization as a comparator of uncertainty is qualitatively\ndifferent from, and stronger than, scalar measures of uncertainty. Consequently, the entanglement detection results developed here represent a qualitative strengthening\nof the existing variance and entropic results. This will be\nevident, among other things, by the fact that they yield,\nas corollaries, an infinite class of entanglement detectors\nbased on scalar measures.\nAs mentioned above, results of quantum measurements\nare in general probability vectors deduced from counter\nstatistics, and an information theoretical formulation of\nuncertainty is normally based on an order of uncertainty\ndefined on such vectors (see Paper I). Thus a scalar\nmeasure of uncertainty is commonly a real, non-negative\nfunction defined on probability vectors whose value serves\nto define the uncertainty in question. For example, the\nShannon entropy function is the measure of uncertainty\nfor the standard entropic formulation of uncertainty [9].\nBy contrast, majorization provides a partial order of uncertainty on probability vectors that is in general more\nstringent, and fundamentally stronger, than a scalar measure [10]. Note that, unlike scalar measures, majorization\ndoes not assign a quantitative measure of uncertainty to\n\n\f2\nprobability vectors, and as a partial order may find a pair\nof vectors to be incomparable.\nA characterization of majorization that clarifies the\nforegoing statements can be attained by considering the\nquasi-entropic set of measures. These were defined in\nPaper I as the set of concave, symmetric functions defined on probability vectors, and include the Shannon,\nTsallis, and (a subfamily of) R\u00e9nyi entropies as special\ncases [11]. It is important to realize that the uncertainty\norder determined by one member of the quasi-entropic\nset for a given pair of probability vectors may contradict\nthat given by another. While additional considerations\nmay justify the use of, e.g., Shannon entropy in preference to the others, the foregoing observation clearly indicates the relative nature of the uncertainty order given\nby a specific measure, and immediately raises the following question: are there pairs of vectors for which all\nquasi-entropic measures determine the same uncertainty\norder? The answer is yes, and the common determination of the quasi-entropic set in such cases defines the\nuncertainty order given by majorization. What about\nthe cases where there are conflicting determinations by\nthe members of the quasi-entropic set? The majorization relation defines such pairs as incomparable, whence\nthe \"partial\" nature of the order defined by majorization.\nWe may therefore consider the majorization order to be\nequivalent to the collective order determination of the entire quasi-entropic set (see \u00a7IV). This characterization of\nthe majorization relation clearly shows its standing vis\u00e0-vis the scalar measures of uncertainty. More practical\ndefinitions of the majorization relation will be considered\nin \u00a7II.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In \u00a7II\nwe review elements of the majorization formulation of\nuncertainty needed for our work and establish the notation. In \u00a7III we present the central results of this paper\non entanglement detection, and in \u00a7IV we derive entire\nclasses of entanglement detectors for quasi-entropic measures as corollaries to the theorems of \u00a7III. Concluding\nremarks are presented in \u00a7V. Details of certain mathematical proofs are given in the Appendix.\n\ninition, \u03bb1 is no less uncertain than \u03bb2 if \u03bb1 equals a\nmixture of the permutations of \u03bb2 . Then \u03bb1 is said to be\nmajorized by \u03bb2 and written \u03bb1 \u227a \u03bb2 . An equivalent definition that flushes out the details of the foregoing is based\non the vector \u03bb\u2193 which is obtained from \u03bb by arranging\nthe components of the latter in a nonincreasing order.\nPj 2\u2193\nPj\nThen, \u03bb1 \u227a \u03bb2 if i \u03bb1\u2193\ni \u2264\ni \u03bbi for j = 1, 2, . . . d \u2212 1,\nwhere d is the larger of the two dimensions and trailing zeros are added where needed. As stated earlier, the\nmajorization relation is a partial order, i.e., not every\ntwo vectors are comparable under majorization. As suggested in \u00a7I, two vectors are found to be incomparable\nwhen the difference in their degrees of uncertainty does\nnot rise to the level required by majorization. As evident\nfrom the second definition given above, majorization requires the satisfaction of N \u2212 1 inequalities if the number\nof non-zero components of the majorizing vector is N .\nThis accounts for the strength of the majorization relation as compared to scalar measures of disorder. Indeed\nas alluded to in \u00a7I, for any quasi-entropic function F (\u03bb),\n\u03bb1 \u227a \u03bb2 implies F (\u03bb1 ) \u2265 F (\u03bb2 ), but not conversely. On\nthe other hand, if for every quasi-entropic function F (\u03bb)\nwe have F (\u03bb1 ) \u2265 F (\u03bb2 ), then \u03bb1 \u227a \u03bb2 [10].\nTo establish uncertainty bounds, we need to characterize the greatest lower bound, or infimum, and the least\nupper bound, or supremum, of a set of probability vectors [12]. The infimum is defined as the vector that is\nmajorized by every element of the set and in turn majorizes any vector with that property . The supremum is\nsimilarly defined. We will briefly outline the construction\nof the infimum here and refer the reader to Paper I for\nfurther details.\nN\nGiven a set of probability vectors {\u03bba }a=1 , consider\ninf\nthe vector \u03bc\ndefined by\nXj\nXj\n\u03bcinf\n= 0, \u03bcinf\n= min\n\u03bb1\u2193\n,\n\u03bb2\u2193 , . . . ,\n0\nj\ni\ni=1\ni=1 i\nXj\n\u2193\u0001\n\u03bbN\n, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 dmax ,\n(1)\ni\ni=1\n\nwhere dmax is the largest dimension found in the set. The\ninfimum is then given by\n\u03bbinf\n= [inf(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbN )]i = \u03bcinf\n\u2212 \u03bcinf\ni\ni\ni\u22121 ,\n\nII.\n\nMAJORIZATION FORMULATION OF\nUNCERTAINTY\n\nThis section presents a review of the basic elements\nof majorization theory and the formulation of the uncertainty principle based on it. It follows the treatment\ngiven in Paper I.\n\nA.\n\nMajorization\n\nThe basic element of our formulation is the majorization protocol for comparing the degree of uncertainty,\nor disorder, among probability vectors, i.e., sequences of\nnon-negative numbers summing to unity [10]. By def-\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 1 \u2264 i \u2264 dmax . The construction of the supremum\nstarts with \u03bcsup in parallel with Eq. (1), but with \"max\"\nreplacing \"min,\" and may require further steps detailed\nin Paper I.\nIt is worth noting here that the infimum (supremum)\nof a pair of probability vectors will in general be more\n(less) disordered than either. Important special cases are\n(i) one of the two majorizes the other, in which case the\nlatter is the infimum and the former the supremum of\nthe two, and (ii) the two are equal, in which case either\nis both the infimum and the supremum. Furthermore,\na useful qualitative rule is that the more \"different\" are\ntwo probability vectors, the further will the infimum or\nsupremum of the two be from at least one of them. Finally, we note that while the infimum or supremum of a\n\n\f3\nset of probability vectors always exists, it need not be a\nmember of the set.\n\nB.\n\nMeasurement and uncertainty\n\nA generalized measurement may be defined by a set\nof positive operators {\u00ca\u03b1 } called measurement elements\nP\nand subject to the completeness condition \u03b1 \u00ca\u03b1 = 1\u0302.\nThe probability that outcome \u03b1 turns up in a measurement of the state \u03c1\u0302 is given by the Born rule P\u03b1 (\u03c1\u0302) =\ntr[\u00ca\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302]. A generalized measurement can always be considered to be the restriction of a more basic type, namely\na projective measurement, performed on an enlarged system to the system under generalized measurement [13].\nA projective measurement is usually associated with an\nobservable of the system represented by a self-adjoint operator M\u0302 , and entails a partitioning of the spectrum of\nM\u0302 into a collection of subsets {bM\n\u03b1 } called measurement\nbins. We call a projective measurement maximal if each\nbin consists of a single point of the spectrum of the measured observable.\nHaving assembled the necessary concepts, we can now\ncharacterize uncertainty by means of majorization relations in a natural manner. To start, we define the probability vector PX (\u03c1\u0302) resulting from a measurement X\non a state \u03c1\u0302 to be uncertain if it is majorized by I =\n(1, 0, . . . , 0) but not equal to it. As such, PX (\u03c1\u0302) is said to\nbe strictly majorized by I and written PX (\u03c1\u0302) \u227a\u227a I. Similarly, given a pair of measurements X and Y on a state \u03c1\u0302,\nwe say PX (\u03c1\u0302) is more uncertain, equivalently more disordered, than PY (\u03c1\u0302) if PX (\u03c1\u0302) \u227a PY (\u03c1\u0302). Further, we define\nthe joint uncertainty of a pair of measurements X and Y\nY\nto be the outer product PX \u2297 PY , i.e., PX\u2295Y\n= PX\n\u03b1 P\u03b2 .\n\u03b1\u03b2\nX\nY\nX\nY\nSince H(P \u2297 P ) = H(P ) + H(P ), where H(*) is\nthe Shannon entropy function, this definition is seen to\nbe consistent with its entropic counterpart. As stated\nearlier, PX \u227a PY implies H(PX ) \u2265 H(PY ) but not conversely. These definitions naturally extend to an arbitrary number of states and measurements.\nWe are now in a position to state the majorization\nstatement of the uncertainty principle established in Paper I:\n\"The joint results of a set of generalized measurements\nof a given state are no less uncertain than a probability\nvector that depends on the measurement set but not the\nstate, and is itself uncertain unless the measurement elements have a common eigenstate.\"\nIn symbols,\nPX (\u03c1\u0302) \u2297 PY (\u03c1\u0302) \u2297 . . . \u2297 PZ (\u03c1\u0302) \u227a PX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\n\u227a\u227a I, (3)\nsup\nwhere\nPX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\n= sup\u03c1\u0302 [PX (\u03c1\u0302) \u2297 PY (\u03c1\u0302) \u2297 . . . \u2297 PZ (\u03c1\u0302)], (4)\nsup\nunless the measurement elements {\u00caX , \u00caY , . . . , \u00caZ } have\na common eigenstate in which case PX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\n= I.\nsup\n\nX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\nNote that Psup\nis the majorization uncertainty\nbound for the measurement set considered.\n\nC.\n\nmajorization uncertainty bounds\n\nAs stated above, the uncertainty bound PX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\nsup\ngiven by Eq. (4) depends on the measurement set but\nnot the state of the system. As the supremum of all possible measurement outcomes, it is the probability vector\nthat sets the irreducible lower bound to uncertainty for\nthe set. As such, it is the counterpart of the variance\nproduct or entropic lower bound in the traditional formulations of the uncertainty principle. Unlike the latX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\nter, however, Psup\nis in general not realizable or\neven approachable by any state of the system. Therefore,\nthere is in general no such thing as a \"minimum uncertainty state\" within the majorization framework. This\nis a consequence of the fact, mentioned earlier, that the\ninfimum or supremum of a set of vectors need not be a\nmember of the set. An obvious special case is the trivial\nX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\n= I,\nexample of zero uncertainty for which Psup\nsignaling the existence of a common eigenstate for the\nmeasurement elements.\nIntuitively, we expect that mixing states can only increase their uncertainty, as is known to be the case for\nscalar measures of uncertainty. In case of majorization,\nthis expectation is manifested in the property that the\nX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\nis in general realized on\nuncertainty bound Psup\nthe class of pure states. Indeed for two and three mutually unbiased observables on a two-dimensional Hilbert\nspace considered, we found in Paper I that the required\nmaxima for the components of \u03bcsup that serve to define the uncertainty bound are reached on pure states.\nMore specifically, as outlined in \u00a7IIA above and detailed\nin \u00a7IIB, IVA and IVB of Paper I, the calculation of\nX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\ninvolves a component-wise determination of\nPsup\nsup\n\u03bc\nby a series of maximizations over all possible density matrices \u03c1\u0302. The property in question then guarantees\nthat the maximization process can be limited to density\nmatrices representing pure states only. We will prove this\nassertion in general, as well as for the class of separable\nstates, in the Appendix.\n\nIII.\n\nENTANGLEMENT DETECTION\n\nAs discussed earlier, an entanglement detector can be\neffective in deciding whether a given density matrix is\nseparable by providing a condition that is satisfied by\nall separable states and if violated signals entanglement.\nA large body of entanglement detection strategies have\nbeen developed in recent years which are primarily based\non scalar conditions, including those based on variance\nand entropic type uncertainty relations, which can be\nfound in Refs. [5\u20138]. Here we shall develop majorization conditions for entanglement detection based on the\nformulation of measurement uncertainty given in Paper\n\n\f4\nI and outlined in \u00a7II above. In particular, the entanglement condition given in Theorem 1 below is linear and\nsusceptible to experimental implementation, so it can\nbe formulated as an entanglement witness. Nonlinear\ndetectors developed below, on the other hand, rely on\nmajorization-based uncertainty relations. We will also\nintroduce the notion of subsystem disorder and a sharpened version of the Nielsen-Kempe [14] separability condition as a nonlinear entanglement detector.\nAs majorization relations, our results in general entail multiple inequalities whose number will grow with\nthe uncertainty levels involved. As discussed in \u00a7IIA,\nthis is an important feature of the majorization relation\nas comparator of disorder, one that sets it apart from\nscalar conditions and provides for the refinement needed\nin comparing highly disordered vectors. As will be seen\nin \u00a7IV, this property has the consequence that each majorization condition yields a scalar condition for the entire\nquasi-entropic class of uncertainty measures.\nA.\n\nLinear detectors\n\nOur detection strategy is based on the intuitive expectation that the measurement uncertainty bound for the\nclass of separable states of a multipartite system must\nbe majorized by the corresponding bound for all states,\nand that this hierarchy can be exploited for entanglement detection. This is the majorization rendition of\nthe strategy often used to derive separability conditions\n[7, 8]. We will first consider the case of one generalized\nmeasurement resulting in a linear detection condition.\nTheorem 1. Let the results of the generalized meaABC...F\nof\nsurement (X, {\u00caX\n\u03b1 }) on a multipartite state \u03c1\u0302\nparties (A, B, C, . . . , F ) defined on a finite-dimensional\nHilbert space be bounded by\nPX\nsup\n\n= sup\u03c1\u0302ABC...F P (\u03c1\u0302\nX\n\nABC...F\n\n),\n\n(5)\n\nand in the case of a separable state \u03c1\u0302ABC...F\nby\nsep\nPX\nPX (\u03c1\u0302ABC...F\n).\nsep;sup = sup\u03c1\u0302ABC...F\nsep\nsep\n\n(6)\n\nThen, (i) the suprema in the foregoing pair of equations\nmay be taken over the class of pure and pure, product states, respectively, and (ii) given an arbitrary state\n\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F , the condition PX (\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F ) \u2280 PX\nsep;sup implies\nthat \u03c3\u0302 ABC...F is entangled [15].\nPart (i) of Theorem 1 is the majorization version of\nthe familiar result that uncertainty bounds are realized\non pure states and is proved in the Appendix [16]. Part\n(ii) is the statement that the bound in Eq. (6) is a necessary condition for separability and its violation signals\nthe existence of entanglement. As noted above, Theorem\n1 provides an operational method of entanglement detection and can be reformulated as a set of entanglement\nwitnesses.\nClearly, the efficacy of Theorem 1 in detecting entanglement depends on the choice of the measurement X for\n\na given quantum state. This suggests looking for the optimum measurement, in parallel with the optimization\nproblem for entanglement witnesses [17]. Note that here\nthe choice of the generalized measurement X affects both\nPX (\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F ) and PX\nsep;sup , thus making the task of finding a fully optimized solution rather difficult. It is therefore fortunate that we can achieve a partial optimization\non the basis of Theorem 3 of Paper I, the relevant content\nof which we can state as follows:\nLemma Under the conditions of Theorem 1 and with\nX restricted to rank 1 measurements, we have\n?\n\nPX (\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F ) \u227a PX (\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F ) = \u03bb(\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F ),\n\n(7)\n\nwhere X? is a maximal projective measurement whose elements are the set of rank 1 orthogonal projection operators onto the eigenvectors of \u03c3\u0302 ABC...F and \u03bb(\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F )\nis the corresponding spectrum.\nIt should be noted here that while the choice of X?\nsucceeds in optimizing PX (\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F ) which appears in\npart (ii) of Theorem 1, its effect on PX\nsep;sup , the other\nobject appearing therein, is unknown and may result in\na poor overall choice. Moreover, any degeneracy in the\nspectrum of \u03c3\u0302 ABC...F renders X? nonunique and subject\nto further optimization. These features will be at play\nin the example considered below where, the foregoing\ncaveats notwithstanding, the resulting detector turns out\nto be fully optimal.\nThe example in question is the Werner state \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q)\nfor a bipartite system of two d-level parties A and B\ndefined on a d2 -dimensional Hilbert space [18, 19]\n1\n(1 \u2212 q)1\u0302 + q | B1 ihB1 |,\nd2\n\n(8)\n\n1 Xd\u22121\n| A, ji\u2297 | B, ji.\n| B1 i = \u221a\nj=0\nd\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q) =\nwhere\n\nHere {| A, ji} and {| B, ji}) are orthonormal bases for\nsubsystem A and B respectively. Also, here and elsewhere we use the symbol 1\u0302 to denote the identity operator of dimension appropriate to the context. Note that\n| B1 i is the generalization\nof the two-qubit Bell state\n\u221a\n(| 00i+ | 11i)/ 2. As such, it is totally symmetric, as\nwell as maximally entangled in the sense that its marginal\nstates are maximally disordered and equal to 1\u0302/d. An\nimportant fact to be used in the following is that \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q)\nis separable if and only if q \u2264 (1 + d)\u22121 [19].\nIn order to probe the separability of \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q) by means\nof Theorem 1, we must first choose a measurement. We\nwill use the above Lemma to guide our choice of the putative optimum measurement X? . The Lemma requires\nthat the measurement elements be equal to the orthogonal projections onto the eigenvectors of \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q). However, a simple calculation shows that the spectrum of\n\u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q) is degenerate, consisting of a simple eigenvalue\nequal to q + d\u22122 (1 \u2212 q) and a (d2 \u2212 1)-fold degenerate\neigenvalue equal to d\u22122 (1 \u2212 q). A natural choice of basis\n\n\f5\nfor the degenerate subspace is a set of d2 \u2212 1 generalized\nBell states which, together with | B1 i of Eq. (9), constid2\ntute the orthonormal eigenbasis {| B\u03b1 i}\u03b1=1 for \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q).\nThis generalized Bell basis is thus characterized by the\nfact that each | B\u03b1 i is maximally entangled and possesses\nequal Schmidt coefficients.\nThe measurement elements of? the optimal measurement X? are thus given by \u00caX\n=| B\u03b1 ihB\u03b1 |, \u03b1 =\n\u03b1\n1, 2, . . . , d2 . With X? so defined, we readily find\n?\n\n\u22122\nPX [\u03c1\u0302wer\n(1 \u2212 q), d\u22122 (1 \u2212 q),\nd (q)] =[q + d\n\nd\u22122 (1 \u2212 q), . . . , d\u22122 (1 \u2212 q)],\n\n(10)\n\nwhich corresponds to the spectrum of \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q) as expected. Note that the Lemma guarantees that any other\nrank 1 measurement in place of X? would produce a more\ndisordered probability vector on the right-hand side of\nEq. (10).\n?\nThe next step is the calculation of PX\nsep;sup of Theorem 1, which is the least disordered probability vector\nthat can result from the measurement of X? on a pure,\nproduct state of two d-level subsystems. As can be seen\nin Eq. (A.7) of the Appendix, this calculation requires\nfinding the maximum overlap of every measurement element | B\u03b1 ihB\u03b1 | with the class of pure, product states.\nThis overlap is given by the square of the largest Schmidt\ncoefficient of the respective Bell state \u221a\n| B\u03b1 i [20]. Since\nall Schmidt coefficients are equal to 1/ d for every Bell\nstate | B\u03b1 i, we can conclude that\n?\n\nPX\nsep;sup = (1/d, 1/d, . . . , 1/d, 0, 0, . . . , 0).\n\n(11)\n\nWe are now in a position to apply the\nentanglement? cri?\nX\nterion of Theorem 1, which reads PX [\u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q)] \u2280 Psep;sup\nin this instance [21]. Using the information in Eqs. (10)\nand (11), we readily see that this criterion translates to\nthe single inequality q+d\u22122 (1\u2212q) > 1/d, or q > 1/(1+d),\nwhich is the necessary and sufficient condition for the inseparability of the Werner state \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q). Thus every entangled Werner state of two d-level systems is detected\nby the measurement X? defined above.\nWhile the efficacy of the generalized Bell states for detecting entanglement in Werner states is well established\n[5\u20138], we note its natural emergence from the general\nmajorization results of this subsection. It should also be\nnoted that Theorem 1 and the foregoing analysis can be\nextended to multipartite states.\n\nand each having a simple spectrum, the product projective measurement XA \u2297 XB on the bipartite system\n\u03c1\u0302AB may be degenerate. A specific case is \u03c3\u0302xA \u2297 \u03c3\u0302xB ,\nwhose spectrum (+1/4, +1/4, \u22121/4, \u22121/4) is doubly degenerate, versus \u03c3\u0302xA or \u03c3\u0302xB each of which has the simple\nspectrum (+1/2, \u22121/2). Note the fact that here we are\nfollowing common practice by defining \u03c3\u0302xA \u2297 \u03c3\u0302xB to be\nthe projective measurement whose two elements project\ninto the subspaces corresponding to the eigenvalues +1/4\nand \u22121/4 (and not the rank 1 projective measurement\nthat resolves the degeneracies by virtue of using all four\nproduct elements). Consequently, it may happen that\nXA \u2297 XB and YA \u2297 YB have a common eigenstate while\nXA and YA do not, and that the said common eigenstate\nis an entangled pure state. In such cases, the corresponding probability vectors will reflect the stated differences\nand may be capable of detecting entanglement as in the\ncase of linear detectors.\nConsider two product projective measurements XA \u2297\nXB and YA \u2297 YB performed on the bipartite state \u03c1\u0302AB .\nThe measurement results are then given by\n\nPY\nA\n\n\u2297XB\n\nA\n\nB\n\nP(X\n\nB\n\n\u2297Y\n\nA\n\n(\u03c1\u0302AB ) = tr[\u03a0\u0302Y\n\nA\n\nB\n\nA\n\n\u2297YB\n\n\u2297PY\nA\n\nB\n\n\u2297XB AB\n\n(\u03c1\u0302AB ) = tr[\u03a0\u0302X\n\n\u2297X )\u2295(Y \u2297Y )\n\nA\n\n\u03c1\u0302\n\nA\n\n\u2297Y\nA\n\n(\u03c1\u0302AB ) = PX\n\nB\n\n],\n\n\u03c1\u0302AB ],\n\n\u2297XB\n\n(\u03c1\u0302AB )\n\n(\u03c1\u0302AB ),\n\n(12)\n\nB\n\nwhere \u03a0\u0302X \u2297X and \u03a0\u0302Y \u2297Y , both projection operators\nbut not necessarily rank 1, represent the measurement\nelements of the two product measurements. Note the\nmajorization definition of joint uncertainty, given earlier,\nat work on the last line of Eq. (12). Under these conditions, we have the following general result.\nTheorem 2. The results of measurements XA \u2297 XB\nand YA \u2297 YB on a separable state \u03c1\u0302AB\nsep satisfy\nA\n\nP(X\n\n\u2297XB )\u2295(YA \u2297YB )\n\nX\u2295Y\n(\u03c1\u0302AB\nsep ) \u227a Psup ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere PX\u2295Y\nsup is defined in Eq.

Then Lemma 1 of Ref. [8] asserts that\nA\n\n\u2297XB\n\n(\u03c1\u0302A \u2297 \u03c1\u0302B ) \u227a PX (\u03c1\u0302A ),\n\nA\n\n\u2297YB\n\n(\u03c1\u0302A \u2297 \u03c1\u0302B ) \u227a PY (\u03c1\u0302A ).\n\nPX\nPY\n\nB.\n\nA\n\nPX\n\nA\n\nA\n\n(14)\n\nNonlinear detectors\n\nUsing these relations and Eq. (12), we find [22]\nAs an example of nonlinear entanglement detectors,\nwe will derive majorization conditions for separability\nbased on uncertainty relations. The method we will\nfollow relies on the degeneracy properties of projective\nmeasurements on a single system versus the products of\nsuch measurements on a multipartite system [7, 8]. For\nexample, with measurement XA on \u03c1\u0302A and XB on \u03c1\u0302B\n\nA\n\nP(X\n\n\u2297XB )\u2295(YA \u2297YB )\n\nA\n\nA\n\n(\u03c1\u0302A \u2297 \u03c1\u0302B ) \u227a PX (\u03c1\u0302A ) \u2297 PY (\u03c1\u0302A ).\n(15)\nSince the right-hand side of Eq.

(13), can be found\namong pure, product states [16]. This assertion is established in Eq. (A.8) et seq. of the Appendix. Consequently, the product state \u03c1\u0302A \u2297 \u03c1\u0302B in Eq. (16) may be\nreplaced by any separable state \u03c1\u0302AB\nsep , thereby establishing\nEq. (13) and Theorem 2.\nWe note in passing that, because the measurements\nconsidered in Theorem 2 are in general not rank 1, the\nLemma which we used earlier for detector optimization\ncannot be applied here.\nTo illustrate Theorem 2, we will consider the case of\nthree mutually unbiased observables measured on bipartite states of two-level systems, as in \u00a7IVB of Paper I. In\neffect, this amounts to measuring products of the three\nspin components of a pair of spin-1/2 systems (or qubits).\nFor this case, Eq. (16) reads\nA\n\n\u2297\u03c3x B )\u2295(\u03c3y A \u2297\u03c3y B )\u2295(\u03c3z A \u2297\u03c3z B )\n\n\u03c3x \u2295\u03c3y \u2295\u03c3z\n,\n(\u03c1\u0302AB\nsep ) \u227a Psup\n(17)\nwhere \u03c1\u0302AB\nsep is any separable state of two qubits. Thus\na violation of this relation by a two-qubit state implies\nthat it is entangled.\nFor the set of states \u03c1\u0302AB to be probed by Theorem 2,\nwe will consider the Werner family of two-qubit states\n\nP(\u03c3x\n\n\u03c1\u0302wer (q) =\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 q)1 + q | B1 ihB1 |,\n4\n\n(18)\n\nwhich is known to be entangled if and only if\u221aq > 1/3.\nHere 0 \u2264 q \u2264 1 and | B1 i = (| 00i+ | 11i)/ 2 is the\ntotally symmetric Bell state of Eq.

[7] detects entanglement in \u03c1\u0302wer (q)\nfor q > 0.65. Reference [8], using the same method but\nrelying on the family of Tsallis entropies, matches our\n\ncondition q > 0.577 by means of a numerical calculation\nthat searches over the Tsallis family for optimum performance.\nWe end this subsection by a brief description of a\nsharpened version of the Nielsen-Kempe theorem as a\nnonlinear entanglement detector [12]. This celebrated\ntheorem is an elegant separability condition based on\nmajorization relations. It asserts that the spectrum of\na separable bipartite state is majorized by each of its\nmarginal spectra. By extension, this theorem guarantees\nthat the spectra of all possible subsystems of a separable\nmultipartite system must majorize its global spectrum\n[14]. Our version of this theorem employs the notion of\nthe infimum of a set of probability vectors discussed in\n\u00a7IIA, and is based on the observation that if a probability\nvector is majorized by each member of a set of probability\nvectors, then it must also be majorized by the infimum\nof that set.\nConsider the multipartite state \u03c1\u0302ABC...F together\nf\nwith all its subsystem states {\u03c1\u0302Xa }a=1 and subsystem\nf\nf\nspectra {\u03bbXa }a=1 , where {Xa }a=1 represent all proper\nsubsets of the set of parties (A, B, C, . . . , F ). Then\nthe infimum of the subsystem spectra, \u039bABC...F =\ninf[\u03bbX1 , \u03bbX2 , . . . , \u03bbXf ], embodies the subsystem disorder\nof the state \u03c1\u0302ABC...F , as expressed in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3 (Nielsen-Kempe). A multipartite state is\nentangled if its system disorder fails to exceed its subsystem disorder, i.e., \u03bbABC...F is entangled if \u03bbABC...F \u2280\n\u039bABC...F .\n\nIV.\n\nQUASI-ENTROPIC DETECTORS\n\nThe majorization based theorems of the previous section have direct corollaries that yield scalar entanglement\ndetectors for the entire class of Schur-concave measures.\nA Schur-concave function G is defined by the property\nthat \u03bb1 \u227a \u03bb2 implies G(\u03bb1 ) \u2265 G(\u03bb2 ) [23]. Equivalently, Schur-concave functions are characterized by being monotonic with respect to the majorization relation.\nThey include all functions G(*) that are concave and symmetric with respect to the arguments, a subset which we\nhave defined as quasi-entropic. An important subclass\nof quasi-entropic functions is obtained if we restrict G to\nhave the following trace structure:\nG(\u03bb) = tr[g(\u03bb)] =\n\nX\n\u03b1\n\ng(\u03bb\u03b1 ),\n\n(20)\n\nwhere g(*) is a concave function of a single variable and \u03bb\nis treated as a diagonal matrix for the purpose of calculating the trace. Note that G(*) as constructed in Eq. (20) is\nmanifestly symmetric and, as a sum of concave functions,\nit is also concave. We shall refer to this class of functions, which include the Shannon and Tsallis entropies,\nas trace type quasi-entropic. An important fact regarding this class of measures is that if, for a given pair of\n\n\f7\n\nCorollary 1. Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the\nmultipartite state \u03c3\u0302 ABC...F is entangled if\nG[PX (\u03c3\u0302 ABC...F )] < G[PX\nsep;sup ].\n\n(21)\n\nCorollary 2.

Using\nCorollary 1 together with the Tsallis entropy function,\nwe find that \u03c1\u0302wer\nd (q) is entangled if\n\u0002 ?\n\u0003\n\u0002 X?\n\u0003\ntsa\nSrtsa PX [\u03c1\u0302wer\nPsep;sup ,\n(24)\nd (q)] < Sr\nwhere Srtsa (*) is the Tsallis entropy of order r, and the\ntwo probability vectors appearing in Eq.

The Tsallis entropy of order 1 is defined\nby continuity and equals the Shannon entropy [25].\nA straightforward calculation turns Eq. (24) into\nr\n\nr\n\n1 \u2212 [q + (1 \u2212 q)/d2 )] \u2212 (d2 \u2212 1)[(1 \u2212 q)/d2 )]\nr\u22121\n1 \u2212 d1\u2212r\n<\n.\n(25)\nr\u22121\n\n0.8\n0.6\nq\n\nprobability vectors \u03bb and \u03bc, we have G(\u03bb) > G(\u03bc) for\nevery trace type quasi-entropic measure G, then \u03bb \u227a \u03bc.\nThe standard entropic measure of uncertainty [9],\nwhich is based on the Shannon entropy function, is\ntrace type quasi-entropic and corresponds to the choice\ng(x) = H(x) = \u2212x ln(x) in Eq. (20). An example of an\ninformation theoretically relevant measure that is quasientropic but not trace type is the R\u00e9nyi subfamily of entropies of order less than one [24]. Accordingly, although\nthe scalar entanglement detectors that follow from the\ntheorems of \u00a7III actually hold for the entire class of Schurconcave measures, we will continue to focus on the quasientropic class as the most suitable for information theoretical applications.\nScalar entanglement detectors based on Shannon,\nTsallis, and R\u00e9nyi entropies are already well known, albeit with detection bounds that may differ from those\nreported here [5, 7, 8]. Our primary purpose here is to\nemphasize the natural and categorical manner in which\nmajorization based entanglement detectors yield entire\nclasses of scalar detectors.\nWith G(*) a quasi-entropic function, the aforementioned monotonicity property implies the following\ncorollaries to Theorems 1-3.\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nd\nFIG. 1: Entanglement detection threshold q for a bipartite\nWerner state versus dimension d of each party, using Corollary\n1 and the Tsallis entropy. The order of the Tsallis entropy\nequals, from top to bottom respectively, 1(red), 2 (magenta),\n5 (turquoise), and \u221e (blue). The top graph corresponds to\nthe Shannon entropy and the bottom one (d) reproduces the\nknown entanglement threshold for the state.\n\nFor each value of r, Eq. (25) yields an entanglement detection threshold value for q which depends on d, and\nfor a fixed value of the latter, decreases with increasing\nr. This corresponds to improving detection performance\nwith increasing r, a behavior which is known for d equal\nto 2 and 3 [8]. Figure 1 shows a plot of the threshold\nvalue q versus the dimension d for four different values of\nthe order r, respectively increasing from top to bottom.\nThe improvement in entanglement detection for fixed d\nand increasing r, as well as fixed r and increasing d, is\nclearly in evidence in Fig. 1.\nThe weakest performance obtains for r = 1, top graph\nin Fig. 1, and can be found by taking the limit of Eq. (25)\nas r \u2192 1. The result is H[q + (1 \u2212 q)/d2 ]) + (d2 \u2212\n1)H[q + (1 \u2212 q)/d2 ] < ln(d), which corresponds to the\nchoice of Shannon entropy function H(*) together with\nthe set of generalized Bell states for the measurement of\nd \u2297 d Werner states [26]. The best performance obtains\nfor r \u2192 \u221e in Eq. (25), which simplifies to q > 1/(1 + d),\nthe known entanglement threshold for a the two-qudit\nWerner state. This limiting case corresponds to the bottom graph in Fig. 1.\nThe foregoing discussion of how well Corollary 1 does\nin detecting entanglement notwithstanding, the aim of\nthis section is not to promote quasi-entropic detectors\ngiven in Corollaries 1-3 per se, but rather to emphasize\nthe reach of the majorization results of \u00a7III whence they\nare inherited. In addition, the above example highlights\nthe fact that, while the entanglement detection bounds\ngiven in Corollaries 1-3 are optimal for Schur-concave\nfunctions as a class, their performance need not be optimal for individual members of the class, a fact that was\nemphasized in paper I as well.\n\n\f8\nV.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we have developed entanglement detection criteria within the majorization formulation of\nuncertainty presented in paper I. These are inherently\nstronger than similar scalar conditions in the sense that\nthey are equivalent to and imply infinite classes of such\nscalar criteria. Majorization relations in effect envelope the set of scalar measures of disorder based on\nSchur-concave functions, a huge set that includes the\ninformation-theoretically relevant class of quasi-entropic\nmeasures as a subset. This enveloping property elucidates the exceptional effectiveness of majorization relations in dealing with problems of quantum information\ntheory.\nEntanglement detection criteria that can be experimentally implemented are especially useful in studies involving entangled microsystems, hence the importance of\nlinear detectors and entanglement witnesses. As already\nmentioned, Theorem 1 can be formulated as an entanglement witness inasmuch as it is a linear majorization\ncondition on measurement results. What may not be so\nobvious is that in principle the spectrum of a state is also\nexperimentally accessible on the basis of the Lemma of\n\u00a7IIIA. That Lemma states that the spectrum of a quantum state is the supremum of probability vectors that\nmay be deduced from the counter statistics of all possible rank 1 generalized measurements performed on the\nstate. In practice, this provides an experimental method\nfor estimating the spectrum, since a high precision determination may require a search over a large number of\npossible measurements.\nThere is already an extensive literature on entanglement detection with many important results. With the\nnotable exception of the Nielsen-Kempe theorem, these\nresults are not formulated within the majorization framework. The present contribution in part serves to demonstrate the effectiveness of the majorization formulation of\nsome of the existing methods. One can reasonably expect\na sharpening of the results of some of the other entanglement detection strategies when reformulated within the\nmajorization framework. It is also not unreasonable to\nexpect useful, albeit computationally intractable, necessary and sufficient separability criteria to emerge from\nsuch formulations.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was in part supported by a grant from California State University, Sacramento.\n\nAppendix: majorization bounds are found on pure\nstates\n\nOur task here is to establish that majorization uncertainty bounds can be reached on pure states. We will\n\nprove this for two important cases, first for the uncertainty bound on all states of the system, and second on\nthe class of separable states. To avoid unnecessary clutter and technical distractions, we will limit the number\nof generalized measurements to three and the underlying Hilbert spaces to finite dimensions in the following\ntreatment.\nSuppose generalized measurements (X, {\u00caX\n\u03b1 }),\n(Y, {\u00caY\u03b2 }), and (Z, {\u00caZ\n})\nare\nperformed\non\na\nstate\n\u03c1\u0302\n\u03b2\nthat is supported on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.\nWhat we will show below is that the search for the\nX\u2295Y\u2295Z\ncomponents of \u03bcsup which serve to define Psup\ncan\nbe limited to pure states.\nBy definition,\nX\u2295Y\u2295Z\nPsup\n= sup\u03c1\u0302 [PX\u2295Y\u2295Z (\u03c1\u0302)],\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere\nY\nZ\nPX\u2295Y\u2295Z\n(\u03c1\u0302) = tr(\u00caX\n\u03b1 \u03c1\u0302)tr(\u00ca\u03b2 \u03c1\u0302)tr(\u00ca\u03b3 \u03c1\u0302).\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\n(A.2)\n\nWe recall from \u00a7IIA above and \u00a7IIB, IVA and IVB\nof Paper I that the supremum defined by Eqs. (A.1)\nand (A.2) is found by calculating \u03bcsup\nfor i = 1, 2, . . .\ni\nsup\n(\u03bcsup\n=\n0\nby\ndefinition).\nFurthermore,\n\u03bc\nis the max0\n1\nimum value of a single component of PX\u2295Y\u2295Z (\u03c1\u0302) as \u03c1\u0302\nis varied, \u03bcsup\nis the maximum value of the sum of two\n2\n(different) components of PX\u2295Y\u2295Z (\u03c1\u0302) as \u03c1\u0302 is varied, and\n\u03bcsup\nis the maximum value of the sum of i (different)\ni\ncomponents of PX\u2295Y\u2295Z (\u03c1\u0302) as \u03c1\u0302 is varied. It is thus sufficient to prove that the said maximum for \u03bcsup\nis in fact\ni\nrealized on P\na pure state.\nLet \u03c1\u0302 = a \u03bba (\u03c1\u0302) | \u03c8a ih\u03c8a | be the principal ensemble representation for \u03c1\u0302.

The symbol \u03b4ab in the above\nexpression is the Kronecker delta, and the three sets of indices {(\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)1 , (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)2 , . . . , (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)i } are understood\nto be distinct, i.e., \u03b11 6= \u03b12 6= . . . 6= \u03b1i , and similarly for\nthe other two sets. Note also that since h\u03c8a | \u03c8b i is in\ngeneral a Hermitian matrix (in the indices a and b), the\nLagrange multipliers \u03b7i,ba may also be taken to constitute\na Hermitian matrix.\nA variation with respect to h\u03c8a | gives\nX\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bba (\u03c1\u0302) \u00caiX + \u00caiY + \u00caiZ | \u03c8a i =\n\u03b7i,ba | \u03c8b i, (A.4)\nb\n\n\f9\nwhere\n\u00caiX =\n\nXi\nk=1\n\nZ\nX\nPY\n\u03b2k (\u03c1\u0302)P\u03b3k (\u03c1\u0302)\u00ca\u03b1k ,\n\n(A.5)\n\nand \u00caiZ and \u00caiY are defined similarly. Note that the three\noperators introduced in Eqs. (A.4) and (A.5) are Hermitian and positive.\nLet \u00cai = \u00caiX + \u00caiY + \u00caiZ and Ei,aa = h\u03c8a | \u00cai | \u03c8a i. Then\nthe maximum sought in (A.3), namely \u03bcsup\ni , is given by\nP\n\u03bb\n(\u03c1\u0302)E\n/3\n=\ntr[\n\u00ca\n\u03c1\u0302]/3.\nA\nkey\nfact\nat\nthis juncture\ni,aa\ni\na a\nis that the diagonal elements Ei,aa do not depend on a\nand are all equal. In other words, each pure state | \u03c8a i in\nthe ensemble contributes equally to \u03bcsup\ni . This property\nfollows from a variation of (A.3) with respect to \u03bba (\u03c1\u0302),\nwhich leads to\n\u03bei = h\u03c8a | \u00caiX + \u00caiY + \u00caiZ | \u03c8a i = Ei,aa .\n\na,b,c\n\n\u0002\n\u0003 A\nX\nY\nZ\nB\nA\nA\nqa h\u03c6B\na | (\u00cai + \u00cai + \u00cai ) | \u03c6a i | \u03c6a i = \u03b7i,a | \u03c6a i\n\u0002\n\u0003 B\nX\nY\nZ\nA\nB\nB\nqa h\u03c6A\na | (\u00cai + \u00cai + \u00cai ) | \u03c6a i | \u03c6a i = \u03b7i,a | \u03c6a i,\n(A.8)\n\n(A.6)\n\nClearly then, each pure state | \u03c8a i in the ensemble must\nrealize the same maximum \u03bcsup\nas the entire ensemble \u03c1\u0302.\ni\nWe conclude therefore that the sought maximum can be\nfound among the pure states of the system.\nWhat if we are looking for \u03bcsup\nbut with \u03c1\u0302 limited to\ni\nseparable states? It turns out that here too the search\ncan be limited to pure states, which would be pure product states in this instance. To establish this result, we\nwill P\nmodify the foregoing analysis by stipulating that\nB\nB\nA\n\u03c1\u0302 = a qa | \u03c6A\na ih\u03c6a | \u2297 | \u03c6a ih\u03c6a | representing a separable, bipartite state of parties A and B .

Furthermore, a variation\nwith respect to the probabilities {qa } shows the equality\nof the matrix elements Ei,aa just as in the general case\nabove, whereupon we learn that each pure product state\nin the ensemble makes the same contribution to \u03bcsup\nsep,i .\nIn other words, the separable density matrix which maximizes (A.7) may be taken to be a pure product state\n[16].\n\nA\nZ\nA\nB\n\u00d7h\u03c6B\nc | \u2297h\u03c6c | \u00ca\u03b32 | \u03c6c i\u2297 | \u03c6c i\n\n+...\n\n(A.7)\n\nIt should be clear from the above arguments that the\nresults hold for any number of generalized measurements\nas well as any number of parties in the multipartite state.\nIn summary, then, we have found that the joint majorizaX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\ntion uncertainty bound, Psup\n, for a set of generalized measurements performed on an arbitrary quantum\nstate supported on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space can\nbe found on the class of pure states of the system, and in\nX\u2295Y\u2295...\u2295Z\nthe case of a separable states, Psep;sup\ncan be found\non the class of pure product states of the system.\n\n[1] W.
