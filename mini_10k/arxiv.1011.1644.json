Geomechanics [1],\ngranular flow [2] and mixing and segregation of granular materials [3] are but a few examples. The mechanical properties of granular systems depend on various\nparameters such as the volume fraction [4], the particle size distribution [5], material properties as, for example, the particles' friction coefficients [6] or adhesive\nforces [7]. Furthermore, as predicted in [8] and discussed\nin more detail in the following, the mechanical properties strongly depend on the microstructure, i.e., the\nlocal arrangement of the particles.\nThe influence of the microstructure on the mechanical properties is often observed implicitly in experimental and computational mechanical tests on structures\ndiffering in preparation history. Macroscopic stress profiles, for example, where found to strongly depend on\nthe sample preparation procedure and thus its microstructure [9]. However, systematic investigations of\nthe mechanical properties as a function of the microstructure are scarce, for two reasons: first, a systematic study of the microstructure-dependent mechanical\nproperties requires the possibility of an unambiguous\ncharacterization of the microstructural arrangement of\nthe particles. Second, and equally important, it relies\non the possibility of a reproducible generation of microstructures with distinct local arrangements of the\nparticles at constant volume fraction.\n\n\f2\n\nExperimentally, the reproducible control of the\nDOH of colloidal microstructures with volume fractions\nbetween 0.2 and 0.6 is achieved using direct coagulation\ncasting [14,15], which is an in situ enzyme-catalyzed\ndestabilization method. It allows for the coagulation of\nelectrostatically stabilized colloidal suspensions to stiff\nparticle structures by either shifting the pH of the suspension to the particles' isoelectric point or by increasing the ionic strength of the suspension. Shifting the pH\nleads to \"more homogeneous\" microstructures through\ndiffusion-limited aggregation (\u2206pH-method) while increasing the ionic strength results in \"more heterogeneous\" microstructures via reaction-rate-limited aggregation (\u2206I-method). These differences in heterogeneity\nhave been observed using various experimental techniques such as diffusing wave spectroscopy [16], static\nlight transmission [16] or cryogenic scanning electron\nmicroscopy [17].\nRheological and uniaxial compression experiments\non coagulated colloidal particle structures obtained by\ndirect coagulation casting have revealed that those\nwith a more heterogeneous microstructure have significantly higher elastic moduli than their more homogeneous counterparts [18,19,20]. The rheological properties, which are the subject of the computational part\nof this study, were investigated experimentally using a\nBohlin rheometer (Model CS-50, Bohlin Instruments,\nSweden) equipped with a measuring tool of plate/plate\ngeometry (rough surface, 25 mm plate diameter). Oscillatory measurements were performed at a fixed frequency of 1 Hz with increasing strain amplitude. Figure 1 summarizes the measured plateau storage moduli\nG\u2032p , i.e. the elastic shear modulus in the linear regime\n(small deformations), of alumina particle suspensions\n(average particle diameter d0 = 0.4 \u03bcm) destabilized\nby the \u2206pH- and the \u2206I-method, respectively, as a\nfunction of the volume fraction. For this system, ap-\n\n10\n\nheterogeneous (\nhomogeneous (\n\nI)\npH)\n\n1\n\np\n\nG ' in MPa\n\nIn [10], the concept of the degree of heterogeneity (DOH) has been introduced, constituting a scalar\nmeasure of the heterogeneity of the microstructural arrangement of a sphere packing. Three distinct structure characterization methods in conjunction with parameters in fit functions or integrals were shown to allow for a clear quantification and thus classification of\nthe DOH of particle structures. In contrast to distributional structure characterization methods, such as\nthe pair correlation function [11], the bond angle distribution [11], the common neighbors distribution [12]\nor the Minkowski functionals [13], the concept of the\nDOH does not rely on the interpretation of distribution\ncurves. This quantifiability is seen as an advantage in\nview of a correlation of the mechanical to the structural\nproperties.\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nVolume Fraction in %\n\nFig. 1 Experimental plateau storage modulus G\u2032p of alumina\nparticle suspensions (average particle diameter d0 = 0.4 \u03bcm)\nformed by the \u2206pH- and the \u2206I-method of the direct coagulation\ncasting process in dependence of the volume fraction [19].\n\nproximately four times higher elastic properties are\nmeasured for heterogeneous than for homogenous microstructures at corresponding volume fractions [19,21].\nA variation of the \u2206pH-method allowing for a controlled introduction of heterogeneities is the use of\nalkali-swellable polymer particles. Small amounts of\nthese particles, 80 nm in diameter, are admixed to\nthe suspended powder particles under acidic conditions. The polymer particles swell upon changing pH\nduring the internal gelling reaction of the direct coagulation casting process and enfold to 0.7 \u03bcm in diameter, thereby rearranging the powder particles and\nthus producing more heterogeneous microstructures.\nThese more heterogeneous samples exhibit much higher\nmechanical properties in comparison to samples without polymer particles. In particular, they present comparably high mechanical properties as samples with\nheterogeneous microstructures produced by the \u2206Imethod [22,23].\nIn summary, strong evidence is given that the differences in macroscopic mechanical properties of coagulated particle suspensions are controlled by the differences in heterogeneity. A yet unanswered question\nis how these microstructural differences on the length\nscale of a few particle diameters can have such a dramatic influence on the macroscopic mechanical properties.\nThe aim of this study is to perform a systematic\ncomputational analysis of the elastic shear properties of\nparticle packings at constant volume fraction of \u03a6 = 0.4\nand to correlate these properties with the structures'\nDOH.\n\n\f3\n\n2 Materials and Methods\n\nTable 1 Simulation parameters.\n\nIn a first part of this section, the discrete element\nmethod, which is the simulation method used throughout this study, is introduced. Second, the methods, by\nwhich the two sets of initial microstructures are obtained are briefly presented. Then, the method and fit\nfunction that is used in order to quantify the structures'\nDOH is explained and finally, the simulation setup is\npresented.\n\n2.1 Discrete Element Method\nThe discrete element method [24] is a numerical method\nthat allows simulating the motion of large numbers of\ninteracting particles. The simulations presented in this\npaper are performed using the particle flow code in\nthree dimensions PFC3D [25], which is an implementation of the discrete element method using spherical\nparticles. One calculation step consists in the determination of the total force on each particle and the numerical integration of the equations of motion using a\ncentral difference scheme. The force calculation and the\ndetermination of the next positions and velocities are\nthen repeated until the end of the simulation.\nOur model comprises a linear elastic contact law\nbetween particles, particle bonding and damping. The\nlinear elastic contact law relates the contact forces acting on two particles in contact linearly to the relative\ndisplacement between the particles. In PFC3D a softcontact approach is used, wherein the rigid particles are\nallowed to overlap at contact points. The magnitude of\nthe normal contact force Fn is given by\nFn = kn Un ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere kn denotes the normal stiffness and Un is the\noverlap distance (Un > 0). The shear stiffness ks relates\nincremental displacements in shear direction \u2206Us to the\nshear contact force \u2206Fs via\n\u2206Fs = ks \u2206Us .\n\n(2)\n\nThe linear elastic contact law is thus parameterized by\nthe normal and shear stiffnesses.\nThe so-called contact bonds used in PFC3D essentially extend the linear elastic contact law, equations (1)\nand (2), to particles that are separated, i.e., to particles without overlap (Un < 0). These bonds are characterized by a normal and shear strengths, FnB and FsB .\nA bond breaks if either the normal or the shear bond\nstrength is exceeded in normal and shear direction, respectively.\n\nParameter\n\nSymbol\n\nValue\n\nNumber of particles\nParticle radius\nNormal particle stiffness\nShear particle stiffness\nNormal bond strength\nShear bond strength\nDamping coefficient\nFriction coefficient\nVolume fraction\nParticle density\n\nN\nr0\nkn\nks\nFnB\nFsB\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\n\u03a6\n\u03c1\n\n8 000\n0.25 \u03bcm\n50 \u2013 150 N/m\n5 \u2013 15 N/m\n10\u22124 N\n10\u22126 N\n0.9\n0.0\n0.4\n3 690 kg/m3\n\nEnergy dissipation is simulated via a local, nonviscous damping term added to the equations of motion [26]. This damping force Fd is characterized by\nthe damping coefficient \u03b1 and is given componentwise\n(index i \u2208 {1, 2, 3}) by\nFd,i = \u2212\u03b1 |Fi | sign(vi ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere F is the force acting on a particle, v is the particle's velocity and\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 +1, if x > 0\nsign(x) = \u22121, if x < 0 .\n(4)\n\uf8f3\n0, if x = 0\n\nThe damping force is thus proportional to the force\nacting on the particle and indeed leads to energydissipation since Fd * v < 0. In particular, only accelerating motion is damped [25]. An analogous expression\nto Eq. (3) is used to describe the damping of the particles' rotational motion.\nIn conclusion, the simulation model is characterized\nby five microscopic parameters: the stiffness of the particles and the bond strength both for normal and shear\ndirection, and the damping coefficient. These parameters, in the following referred to as microparameters, are\ncompiled in Table 1. In particular, the normal to shear\nparticle stiffness ratio kn /ks = 10 is kept constant and a\nvalue of 0.9 is chosen for the damping coefficient, which\ncorresponds to the values used in previous studies [10,\n27]. In PFC3D the frictional term between two particles is superseded in the presence of a bond. However,\nit may become active in the case of larger deformation\nwhen unbonded particles come into contact. In order\nto prevent such contacts to result in friction, a friction\ncoefficient \u03bc = 0 was used. It has to be mentioned that\nthe present paper does not include a detailed sensitivity\nstudy of every simulation parameter. Here, the focus is\non the influence of the microstructural differences on\nthe mechanical properties. This influence can a priori\nalso be observed with other choices of parameters as\nlong as a unique set is used for all structures.\n\n\f4\n\n2.2 Initial Microstructures\nTwo sets of microstructures are used as initial particle\nconfigurations for the simulation of the elastic properties. A first set originates from previous Brownian\ndynamics (BD) simulations [11,28] where the coagulation of electrostatically stabilized colloidal suspensions\nto stiff particle structures was simulated. The presence\nand depth of a secondary minimum in the inter-particle\npotential, described by the Derjaguin-Landau-VerweyOverbeek theory [29], was shown to account for the\nvariations in the DOH of the resulting particle structures and is adjusted via the surface potential \u03a80 . For\n\u03a80 = 0 mV, the electrostatic double layer repulsion is\nzero and the inter-particle potential is only given by\nthe attractive van der Waals potential. For the set of\nsimulation parameters used in [11,28], a secondary minimum appears for \u03a80 \u2265 12 mV and an energy barrier\nbetween the local maximum and the secondary minimum emerges. For \u03a80 = 15 mV, a repulsive barrier of\n5.65 kB T is present. The model further contains the frictional Stokes' drag force and a random Brownian force\ncaused by the suspending liquid. In this paper, BDmicrostructures generated with \u03a80 = 0, 12, 13, 14 and\n15 mV are used, exhibiting an increasing DOH with\nincreasing \u03a80 [10].\nIn particular, the most and least heterogeneous BDmicrostructures have been shown to nicely correspond\nto experimental silica structures using the pair correlation function [17]. These two structures are thus used\nhere to calibrate the microparameters in order for the\nsimulations to reproduce the experimental values given\nin Fig. 1 (cf. Sec. 3.1).\nThe second set of initial microstructures is obtained\nusing the void expansion method (VEM) presented\nin [30]. In contrast to BD, which simulates the physical processes during coagulation according to established laws and methods, VEM is a purely stochastic method inspired by the experimental generation\nof heterogeneous microstructures using alkali-swellable\npolymer particles. This method employs so-called voidparticles that mimic the polymer particles. The voidparticles, having a small initial diameter, are randomly placed into the simulation box containing the\nstructure-particles. The core part of VEM is the repeated increase in the void-particles' diameter. During\nthis procedure, the structure-particles are rearranged\nand pushed into contact. Finally, the void-particles are\ndeleted. As shown in [27], VEM allows generating microstructures presenting a broad range of DOH, which\nis controlled by the void- to structure-particle number ratio. In particular, VEM-microstructures cover\nan approximately 20% larger range of DOH, slightly\n\nshifted to higher values than the BD-microstructures.\nIn this study, the number of void-particles NV ranges\nbetween 1 000 and 16 000. The void-particles' normal\nand shear stiffness used in VEM are kn,V = 102 N/m\nand ks,V = 10\u22122 N/m, respectively.\nAll structures are submitted to the same relaxation\nprocedure before undergoing the simulated mechanical\ntesting. Bonds between neighboring particles having a\ncenter-to-center separation smaller than d\u01eb = (1 + \u01eb)2r0\nwith \u01eb = 0.01 are installed. Then, several calculation\nsteps are performed, where, after each step, the translational and rotational velocities are set to zero. This\nallows for an efficient reduction of particle overlaps and\nthus of the internal strain energy in the structures without significant changes in the particle positions. The relaxation process is aborted as soon as the mean unbalanced force in the structure has decreased to a constant\nvalue.\nThe structures investigated in this study have equal\nvolume fraction of \u03a6 = 0.4, consist of N = 8 000\nmonodispersed spherical particles having a radius r0 =\n0.25 \u03bcm and are contained in a cubic simulation box\nwith periodic boundaries and edge length Lbox given\nby\n\u00131/3\n\u0012\n4N \u03c0\n.\n(5)\nLbox = r0\n3\u03a6\nThe structures used in this study are provided as electronic supplementary material (Online Resources 1-12).\n2.3 Degree of Heterogeneity\nIn [10], three distinct methods allowing for a quantification of the DOH using scalar measures were introduced.\nHere, the DOH is characterized by means of the cumulative pore size distribution P (rP > r) estimated using\nthe exclusion probability [31]. Equation (6) was shown\nto nicely fit P (rP > r) of both the VEM- and the BDmicrostructures [10,27].\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr/r0 \u2212 b\n\u221a\n.\n(6)\nP (rP > r) = 1 \u2212 erf\na 2\nThe DOH is quantified by the width of the error\nfunction measured by parameter a. The values of a for\nthe various microstructures are summarized in Table 2.\nParameter b represents the location of the maximum\nof the underlying Gaussian distribution, i.e., the most\nprobable pore to particle radius ratio.\nAdditionally, the structures' coordination numbers\nC are given in Table 2 and plotted in Fig. 2 against the\nDOH-parameter a. This figure shows that the DOH and\nthe coordination number are to a large extent independent.\n\n\f5\n1500\n5.1\n\nstress\n\n1000\n\n0.10\n\nstrain\n\nin Pa\n\n4.9\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n0.00\n\n4.7\n\n12\n\n12\n\nC\n\n4.8\n\n500\n\n-500\n\n4.6\n\nBD\n\nin %\n\n5.0\n\n-0.05\n\n-1000\n\n-0.10\n\nVEM\n4.5\n\n-1500\n0.35\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.50\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\na\nFig. 2 Degree of heterogeneity as measured by parameter a as\na function of the coordination number C for all structures used\nin this study.\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nOscillation Cycle\n\nFig. 4 Stress \u03c312 (open squares, left scale) and strain \u03b312 (full\ncircles, right scale) as a function of shear oscillation cycle.\n\ntensor in their respective region. The absolute value\nof the complex modulus G is obtained by dividing the\npeak shear stress value with the actual peak strain of\neach oscillation. The storage modulus G\u2032 is then calculated by multiplication with the cosine of the phase angle between excitation and response, which corresponds\nto the evaluation of G\u2032 according to [32]. In total, the\nsimulations are performed six times for each structure.\nThe shear plate's normal vector is successively oriented\nalong the x-, y- and z-axis and, for each orientation, the\nstructure is sheared along the two remaining axes.\n\n3 Results and Discussion\n3.1 Calibration of the Model\nFig. 3 Rheological simulation setup.\n\n2.4 Simulation Setup\nThe simulation setup is schematically shown in Fig. 3.\nThe structure (white particles) is placed between periodic boundaries in x- and y-direction. In z-direction, the\nboundary conditions are imposed via three additional\nparticle layers (gray), obtained from the periodic repetition of the structure. The lower layers, representing\nthe lower plate in the shear experiment, are immobile\nwhereas the upper layers shear the sample periodically\nalong the x-axis with a fixed frequency of 1 Hz and\nconstant volume. The shear amplitude is increased after each oscillation. In particular, ten oscillations with a\nlinearly increasing deflection of the upper plate up to a\nmaximum deflection of 0.1% Lbox are performed. Spherical regions, so-called measurement spheres [25], are defined in different heights monitoring the mean stress\n\nTypical stress and strain curves are shown in Fig. 4,\npresenting the shear stress \u03c312 (open squares, left scale)\nand the applied shear deflection \u03b312 (full circles, right\nscale) as a function of the shear oscillation cycle. \u03c312\nincreases linearly with \u03b312 and no phase shift between\nexcitation and response is observed (phase angle <\n10\u22124 \u03c0). This confirms that the simulations present a\npurely elastic behavior and the constant ratio \u03c312 /\u03b312\nis identified with the plateau storage modulus G\u2032p .\nThe particle stiffness kn has been calibrated using\nthe most homogeneous and the most heterogeneous BDmicrostructures (\u03a80 = 0 mV and \u03a80 = 15 mV, respectively) using a constant ratio kn /ks = 10. Its influence\non the mechanical properties of these two structures is\nshown in Fig. 5 (left graph).

The resulting G\u2032p -values\nare summarized in Table 2 and are shown in Fig. 6 as\na function of the structures' DOH expressed by parameter a. Triangles and circles correspond to BD- and\nVEM-microstructures, respectively. Each data point\nin Fig. 6 corresponds to one structure sheared in all\nsix directions. The error bars are thus reflecting the\nanisotropy of the structures.\n\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n\np\n\nG'\n\nand 150 N/m. For both microstructures, a linear dependency is found between G\u2032p and kn , which is expressed in\na constant ratio between the G\u2032p -values for the heterogeneous and homogeneous microstructure as a function of\nkn : G\u2032HE\n/G\u2032HO\n\u2248 3.4. This is in good agreement with\np\np\nthe average experimental G\u2032p -ratio of 3.6 at \u03a6 = 0.4.\nFor all further simulations the particle normal stiffness\nis fixed to kn = 100 N/m.\nThe inter-particle bond strength was strictly speaking not part of the calibration process. In order to focus on the initial elastic properties, its value was chosen high enough to prevent any bond breakage for the\ndeformations considered in this study. The chosen normal bond strength FnB = 10\u22124 N, in conjunction with\nthe particle normal stiffness kn = 100 N/m allows for a\nmaximum particle separation distance of 10\u22126 m, which\ncorresponds to two particle diameters. Given the maximum shear displacement of 0.001 Lbox, where Lbox is of\nthe order of roughly 20 particle diameters, this value is\nnever exceeded.\n\nin MPa\n\n1.8\n\n1.0\n\nBD\nVEM\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.35\n\na\n\n0.40\n\n0.45\n\n0.50\n\n0.55\n\n0.60\n\n0\n\na\n\nFig. 6 Simulated plateau storage moduli G\u2032p of the various microstructures (\u03a6 = 0.4, r0 = 0.25 \u03bcm) as a function of the DOH\nin terms of parameter a and power law fit (solid line).\n\nTwo conclusions can be drawn from Fig. 6: first,\nthe elastic properties present a clear dependence on the\nmicrostructure's heterogeneity such that G\u2032p increases\nfor increasing DOH-parameter a. Second, the behavior is independent of the structure generation algorithm. Indeed, the elastic moduli of the VEM- and the\nBD-microstructures agree within the error bars for microstructures with comparable DOH.\nThe solid line in Fig. 6 represents a power law fit\ngiven by\nG\u2032p \u221d (a \u2212 a0 )\u03b2 , a \u2265 a0 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwith a0 = 0.373 \u00b1 0.001 (shown as dashed line in Fig. 6)\nand \u03b2 = 0.187 \u00b1 0.032. The use of this fit function\nis inspired by percolation theory where a power law\nscaling is found for the elastic properties as a function\nof the volume fraction [33,34]. In view of this analogy\nand based on the simulation data currently available,\nthis fit function suggests a phase transition with a0 the\ncritical DOH. Below this value, the elastic properties\n\n\f7\n\nare zero; above this value, they increase for increasing a. A DOH-value a = 0.265 below a0 was found for\nthe stabilized colloidal microstructures with repulsive\ninter-particle potentials [10]. In the model used in this\nwork, this microstructure would indeed present negligible elastic properties since there would be no bonds\nbetween the particles.\nIt has to be mentioned that percolating structures\npresenting a DOH below the critical value exist. Such\nstructures, as for example intermediate steps during the\nsimulated coagulation toward the most homogeneous\nmicrostructure using BD, are not expected to have zero\nelastic properties. However, they have an average coordination number significantly below the range considered in this study and are therefore not included. Also,\nit has to be emphasized that the obtained value for\na0 does not solely rely on the data point possessing the\nlowest a-value. Indeed, a power law fit without this data\npoint yields a\u20320 = 0.360, which is roughly 4% below a0 .\nThe uncertainty of the value for the critical DOH a0\nroots in fitting the power law (Eq. 7) to the simulated\nplateau storage moduli of the samples studied here using error propagation. The limits for a0 do therefore\nnot represent an uncertainty obtained by analyzing a\nstatistically significant control sample. A more extensive study, involving a larger number of microstructures\npossessing a DOH in the immediate vicinity of a0 , i.e.\nbetween 0.35 and 0.4, would be required in order to\ndetermine a0 more accurately.\n4 Summary and Conclusions\nIn this paper, the relation between the microstructure and the elastic properties of packings of spherical particles was investigated computationally using\nthe discrete element method. Two distinct sets of initial microstructures were subjected to strain-controlled\noscillatory shear simulations. The first set originated\nfrom Brownian dynamics simulations [11,28] where the\nphysical processes during coagulation were simulated.\nThe second set was obtained using the void expansion\nmethod [30]. In contrast to Brownian dynamics simulations, the latter is a purely stochastic method. Both sets\ncover a broad range of degrees of heterogeneity, which,\nin this work, was characterized using the width of the\npore size distribution.\nThe simulations of the mechanical properties have\nbeen performed using a discrete element model with five\nmicroparameters: the particle stiffness and the bond\nstrength in normal and shear direction, respectively\nand damping. The inter-particle normal and shear bond\nstrengths were set to a high value in order to prevent any bond breaking for the deformations applied\n\nduring the shear simulations. This allowed focussing\non the initial, purely elastic behavior found in experiment [20]. The particle stiffness was calibrated using\nthe two Brownian dynamics microstructures presenting\nthe highest and lowest DOH, which correspond to experimental silica structures [17].\nA quantitative agreement with experiment was\nachieved. For particle normal stiffnesses ranging between 50 and 150 N/m, the absolute values of the\nexperimental elastic moduli are reproduced, as shown\nin Fig. 5. In particular, the ratio between the elastic\nmoduli of the heterogeneous and the homogeneous microstructures is in good agreement with the experimental value. This latter result is particularly remarkable,\nsince the G\u2032p -ratio has not been subject of any calibration but reflects the influence of the microstructures and\nemphasizes the strong influence of the DOH independently of the interaction potential. Indeed, the model\nused in this study constitutes an important simplification with respect to theoretical models such as the\nDerjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory [29] or the\nJohnson-Kendall-Roberts theory [35]. The former gives\nthe inter-particle potential as the sum of the van der\nWaals attraction and the electrostatic repulsion and the\nlatter describes the adhesive force between particles.\nUsing the calibrated model, the elastic properties\nof all microstructures generated using the void expansion method and Brownian dynamics were simulated.\nThis investigation has revealed a correlation between\nthe elastic properties and the structures' DOH. It has\nalso shown that the elastic properties are independent\nof the structure generation algorithm. Indeed, for structures with comparable degrees of heterogeneity, comparable plateau storage moduli were found. A power\nlaw fit was shown to well reproduce the relation between the plateau storage modulus and the DOH above\na critical value, which indicates a phase transition between a phase with finite and a phase with zero elastic\nproperties. This result is in nice analogy to earlier findings [33,34], where the elastic properties were shown to\nexhibit a power law dependence as a function of the volume fraction. This study thus suggests an extension to\npercolation theory, where usually the volume fraction\nconstitutes the continuous variable presenting a critical\nvalue. Here, the DOH, possessing the same critical behavior as the volume fraction, has been identified as an\nadditional variable.\nThe results presented in this paper show that the\ndegree of heterogeneity is particularly useful in order to\nquantify and characterize the heterogeneity of particle\npackings since it allows for an unprecedented theoretical description of their elastic properties. However, it\ndoes not directly lead to a better understanding of the\n\n\f8\n\nmechanisms, by which the elastic properties increase for\nincreasing heterogeneity. Such an understanding must,\nin some way, include an intermediate step, such as an\nanalysis of the distribution of particle contacts using\nthe fabric tensor, for example [36], or of load-bearing\nsubstructures, as discussed in [12].\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Hans J.\nHerrmann and Tomaso Aste for their valuable help throughout\nthis project.\n\nReferences\n1.
