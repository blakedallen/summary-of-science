In these interacting models, the\nsupersymmetry generators Q\u00b1 yield the Hamiltonian H = {Q+ , Q\u2212 } on any graph. The degrees of\nfreedom can be described as either fermions with hard cores, or as quantum dimers. The Hamiltonian\nof our simplest model contains a hopping term and a repulsive potential, as well as the hard-core\nrepulsion. We discuss these models from a variety of perspectives: using a fundamental relation\nwith conformal field theory, via the Bethe ansatz, and using cohomology methods. The simplest\nmodel provides a manifestly-supersymmetric lattice regulator for the supersymmetric point of the\nmassless 1+1-dimensional Thirring (Luttinger) model. We discuss the ground-state structure of this\nsame model on more complicated graphs, including a 2-leg ladder, and discuss some generalizations.\n\nSupersymmetry is an exceptionally powerful theoretical tool. It often allows exact computations in field theory and string theory, even when interactions are strong.\nIn this paper we introduce N = 2 supersymmetric lattice\nmodels describing interacting fermions and monomerdimer systems. We show that the continuum limit of the\nsimplest of these models, defined on a one-dimensional\nlattice, is a well-known 1 + 1-dimensional quantum field\ntheory with N = 2 superconformal symmetry.\nOur definition of N =2 supersymmetry is that the\nHamiltonian H is built from two nilpotent fermionic generators denoted Q+ and Q\u2212 = (Q+ )\u2020 [1]. It is\nH = {Q+ , Q\u2212 }.\n\n(1)\n\nThe fact that Q+ and Q\u2212 commute with H follows from\nthe nilpotency (Q+ )2 = (Q\u2212 )2 = 0. Our models also\nhave a fermion-number symmetry generated by F with\n[F, Q\u00b1 ] = \u00b1Q\u00b1 . We shall show how, in at least some\ncases, this lattice supersymmetry extends to a spacetime super(conformal) symmetry in the field theory describing the continuum limit. Lattice models with a\nsymmetry involving fermionic generators, such as the tJ model at J=\u00b12t, are often called \"supersymmetric\"\nin the condensed-matter literature, but do not have a\nHamiltonian of the form eq. (1).\nAll eigenvalues E of the Hamiltonian eq. (1) satisfy\nE \u2265 0. All eigenstates form either singlet or doublet\nrepresentations of the supersymmetry algebra. All states\n|gi with E = 0 must be singlets: Q+ |gi = Q\u2212 |gi = 0 [1].\nConversely, all singlets must have E = 0. All the other\neigenstates of H can be decomposed into doublets under\nthe supersymmetry, and conversely any doublet representation is an eigenstate. This is simple to prove: a doublet consists of two states |si, Q+ |si, where Q\u2212 |si = 0.\n\nIt follows from the definition of H and the nilpotency\nof Q\u00b1 that both of these states are eigenstates of H\nwith the same eigenvalue. All eigenstates can be decomposed into doublets: the four-dimensional representation\n(|s\u2032 i, Q\u2212 |s\u2032 i, Q+ |s\u2032 i, Q+ Q\u2212 |s\u2032 i) is reducible. Let\n|si \u2261 |s\u2032 i \u2212\n\n1 + \u2212 \u2032\nQ Q |s i\nEs\n\nwhere Es > 0 is defined by H|s\u2032 i = Es |s\u2032 i. Then\nQ\u2212 |si = 0, and (|si, Q+ |si) and (Q\u2212 |s\u2032 i, Q+ Q\u2212 |s\u2032 i) form\ntwo irreducible doublets.\nThe models we introduce can be defined on any lattice\n(or actually, any graph) in any dimension. The simplest\nmodel involves a single species of fermion ci , placed at\nany site i of the lattice. The fermion obeys the usual\nP anticommutator {ci , c\u2020j } = \u03b4ij , and the operator F = i c\u2020i ci\ncounts the number of fermions. We impose the restriction\nthat the fermions have hard cores, meaning that fermions\nare not allowed on neighboring sites. A hard-core fermion\nis created by c\u2020i P<i> , where the projection operator P<i>\nrequires all sites neighboring i to be empty:\nY\nP<i> =\n(1 \u2212 c\u2020j cj ) .\n(2)\nj next to i\nOn this space of states, the supersymmetry operators are\ndefined by\nX\nX \u2020\nci P<i> .\n(3)\nci P<i>\nQ\u2212 =\nQ+ =\ni\n\ni\n\nIt is easy to verify that (Q+ )2 = (Q\u2212 )2 = 0. The Hamiltonian is therefore\nX\nX\nX\nP<i> .\n(4)\nH=\nP<i> c\u2020i cj P<j> +\ni j next to i\ni\n\n\f2\nThe first term in the Hamiltonian allows fermions to hop\nto neighboring sites, with the projectors maintaining the\nhard-core repulsion. The second term favors having more\nfermions, as long as they are more than two sites from\neach other. Thus one can view it as a repulsive potential\nfor fermions, in addition to the hard core.\nThere are two key questions to try to answer. The first\nis: what properties can be computed exactly using the\nsupersymmetry? We have already noted the positive energy and the pairing in the excited-state spectrum, but\nthese are just the simplest consequences of the supersymmetry. The second question is: what (if any) field theory\ndescribes the model in the continuum limit?\nTo illustrate the power of supersymmetry, we find the\nground states for a chain of six sites and periodic boundary conditions. First, we count all the states. There\nis one state |0i with f =0, and six states c\u2020i |0i with f =1,\nwhile because of the hard cores, there are nine states with\nf =2, and two with f =3. The vacuum obeys Q\u2212 |0i = 0\nP6\nand Q+ |0i = i=1 c\u2020i |0i, so (|0i, Q+ |0i) make up a doublet. The remaining five states with f =1 are all annihilated by Q\u2212 , and Q+ acts non-trivially on them.\nThere are thus five doublets with (f, f + 1) = (1, 2).\nThe states with f =3 are both annihilated by Q+ , and\nQ\u2212 acts non-trivially on both, giving two doublets with\n(f, f + 1) = (2, 3). This accounts for all the states in\nthe theory, except for two states with f =2. These two\ncannot form a doublet, because they have same fermion\nnumber. They therefore must be singlets, so there are\ntwo E=0 ground states in this theory, both with f =2.\nWith a little more work, one finds that they have eigenvalues exp(\u00b1i\u03c0/3) under translation by one site.\nA basic quantity in a supersymmetric theory is the\nWitten index [1]\n\u0003\n\u0002\nW = tr (\u22121)F e\u2212\u03b2H .\n\n(5)\n\nBecause the two states in a doublet have the same energy,\ntheir contribution to W cancels, leaving the trace only\nover ground states and W independent of \u03b2. W can thus\nbe found by evaluating (5) in the \u03b2 \u2192 0 limit, where\nall states contribute with weight (\u22121)F . For example,\nfor the six-site chain discussed above, we confirm that\nW = 1 \u2212 6 + 9 \u2212 2 = 2. For our model on the cube, one\nfinds W = 1 \u2212 8 + 16 \u2212 8 + 2 = 3.\nComputing W for the model eq. (4) on a general\ngraph poses a fascinating combinatorial problem. Cohomology theory is a powerful tool to compute the number of ground states at any fermion number, and therefore also W . The supersymmetry generator Q+ satisfies\n(Q+ )2 = 0, and the E = 0 ground states are precisely\nthe states |si that satisfy Q+ |si = 0 and that cannot be\nwritten in the form |si = Q+ |s\u2032 i. Those states form what\nis called the cohomology of the operator Q+ and for its\ncomputation a variety of techniques are available. These\ninclude the 'spectral sequence' technique, which can be\n\napplied in this context as follows: one splits the lattice\nin two sublattices, with corresponding fermion number\noperators F1 and F2 , so that F = F1 + F2 . Q+ can\n+\n+\nalso be split as Q+\n1 + Q2 , so that Qi increases Fi by\n+\n+\none. The two operators Q1 and Q2 are nilpotent and\nanti-commute. The first step in the spectral sequence\n+\nis to compute the cohomology of Q+\n1 . Q2 becomes an\noperator acting on this cohomology, and the second step\nis to compute the cohomology of Q+\n2 on this subspace.\nOften the process terminates here, and the result is the\ncohomology of Q+ . In general the procedure continues\nfor a finite number of additional steps, see e.g. [2] for\ndetails. A similar procedure exists for a decomposition\nof a lattice into n sublattices, and in particular when\nevery sublattice consists of a single site. Applying this\nto the N -site periodic chain, with F1 consisting of every\nthird site, we find ground states solely at fermion number f = int((N + 1)/3). For a chain with N = 3p with\np integer, we find two ground states (so W = 2(\u22121)p ),\nwhile for N = 3p \u00b1 1, there is a single ground state (so\nW = (\u22121)p ).\nWe now address our questions in the one-dimensional\ncase, where the Hamiltonian eq. (4) is on an N -site chain:\n\nH=\n\nN h\nX\ni=1\n\ni\n\u0011\n\u0010\nPi\u22121 c\u2020i ci+1 + c\u2020i+1 ci Pi+2 + Pi\u22121 Pi+1 (6)\n\nwhere Pi \u2261 1 \u2212 c\u2020i ci is the projector on a single site. We\ntake periodic boundary conditions, so indices are defined\nmod N . The translation operator T commutes with both\nH and F , and its eigenvalues t satisfying tN = 1 characterize the eigenstates of H. The Hamiltonian eq. (6)\nresembles a lattice version of the Thirring model, a 1+1dimensional field theory with a four-fermion interaction\nterm. Below we will make the connection precise.\nBefore we apply the Bethe ansatz, we indicate how\nthe space of states HN of the model can be obtained by\napplying a systematic 'finitization' procedure [3] to the\nchiral spectrum of a specific N = 2 superconformal field\ntheory (SCFT) with central charge c = 1. This construction follows two steps. In the first step, the full chiral\nHilbert space of the SCFT is written in a 'quasi-particle'\nbasis, with the fundamental quasi-particles forming a\nsupersymmetry doublet with charges (1/3, \u22122/3). In\nthe second step, the momenta of the individual quasiparticles are constrained to a maximum value in the order of N , corresponding to a discretization of the space\ndirection of the SCFT with spacing of the order 1/N .\nThis then leads to a truncated or 'finitized' partition sum\nQN (q, w), which is closely related to the partition sum\nN\nZN (q, w) = Tr(q 2\u03c0i log T w(N \u22123F ) ), which keeps track of\nthe eigenvalues of the translation operator T and the\nfermion number F of the lattice model eq. (6). This entire construction, to be detailed elsewhere, respects the\nsupersymmetry. This gives a rationale for the existence of\n\n\f3\nsupersymmetry generators on the space HN , and it provides an independent way of determining the quantum\nnumbers t and f of the supersymmetric ground states.\nWe remark that an analogous construction based on the\nspinon basis of the simplest SU (2)-invariant CFT naturally leads to the space of states of the Heisenberg and\nHaldane-Shastry models for N spin-1/2 degrees of freedom. Clearly, many generalizations are possible.\nHaving discussed the model eq. (6) from different\npoints of view, we now give some of the results of a Bethe\nansatz computation [4]. This computation lets us identify the continuum limit of the theory. An eigenstate of\nH with f fermions is of the form\nX\n\u03c6(i1 , i2 , . . . if )c\u2020i1 c\u2020i2 . . . c\u2020if |0i\n(7)\n\u03c6(f ) =\n{ik }\n\nwhere we order 1 \u2264 i1 < i2 \u2212 1 < i3 \u2212 2 . . . . Bethe's\nansatz for the eigenstates of H is [5]\nX\nif \u22121\ni1 \u22121 i2 \u22121\n\u03c6(i1 , i2 , . . . if ) =\n(8)\nAP \u03bcP\n1 \u03bcP 2 . . . \u03bc P f .\nP\n\nfor some numbers {\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bcf } and AP ; the sum is over\npermutations P of the set (1, 2, . . . , f ). By construction,\nQf\nthe translation operator T has eigenvalue t = k=1 \u03bc\u22121\nk .\nThe next step is to find highest-weight states under the\nsymmetries of the model. In Bethe's case, the symmetry\nis the O(3) of the Heisenberg spin chain; here it is the\nsupersymmetry. Here, Q\u2212 \u03c6(f ) = 0 requires\nt\u22121 (\u03bck )N \u2212f =\n\nf\nY\n\u03bck \u03bcj + 1 \u2212 \u03bck\n\u03bc \u03bc + 1 \u2212 \u03bcj\nj=1 k j\n\nE = N \u2212 2f +\n\nk=1\n\n\u0015\n1\n.\n\u03bci +\n\u03bci\n\nR(q \u22122 w) = tq \u2212N R(w) + t\u22121 q N R(q 2 w).\n\n(11)\n\nWe derive an explicit expression for R(w) in the sequel\n[4], but from (11) directly we can rederive f and t for the\nground state(s). When N = 3p with p an integer, there\nare non-trivial solutions to (11) only when f = N/3 and\nt = (\u22121)N exp(\u00b1i\u03c0/3). For N 6= 3p, one has only a single\nsolution with f = int((N + 1)/3), and t = (\u22121)N \u22121 .\nWe can see heuristically why the ground state has\nf = int((N + 1)/3). The potential term in (6) alone is\nminimized by the state with a fermion on every third site;\nadding any more fermions forces fermions to be two sites\naway and raises the energy. The hopping term alone also\ndiscourages fermions from being only two sites away, because it has negative eigenvalues when fermions can hop\nto an adjacent site and back again, and the hard cores\nprevent this if there is another fermion two sites away.\nThe state with a fermion on every third site,\n*** \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6\u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 ...\n\n(9)\n\nfor all k = 1 . . . f . These are very similar to the Bethe\nequations for the antiferromagnetic XXZ spin chain at\n\u2206 = \u00b11/2 [6]. The only difference in (9) is in the lefthand-side, which in the XXZ case reads (\u03bck )N \u03c4 , where\n\u03c4 6= 1 corresponds to twisted boundary conditions.\nDemanding that a state be an eigenstate of a continuous symmetry fixes all the free parameters in the Bethe\nansatz. The miracle of the ansatz is that in the Heisenberg and other integrable models, this state is also an\neigenstate of the Hamiltonian. In our case, supersymmetry provides the miracle. Any Bethe ansatz state obeying\nQ\u2212 |si = 0 is either a singlet or part of a doublet, and so\nit must be an eigenstate of H. Its energy is\nf \u0014\nX\n\nThe Bethe equations are f coupled polynomial equations of order N . They cannot be solved in closed form,\nand to make further progress, one usually needs to take\nN large. In our case, however, the supersymmetry allows us to derive more results from the Bethe ansatz\nfor finite N . Precisely, we define wk in terms of \u03bck as\nwk = (\u03bck \u2212 q)/(q\u03bck \u2212 1), where q \u2261 exp(\u2212i\u03c0/3). Then\nQf\nBaxter's Q-function [6] Q(w) \u2261 i=1 (w \u2212 wk ) has zeroes\nat w = wk . Defining R(w) \u2261 Q(w)(1 + w)N \u2212f , we find\nthat for the wk giving the ground state,\n\n(10)\n\nThe supersymmetry doublets appear naturally within the\nBethe ansatz. If (\u03bc1 , . . . \u03bcf ) satisfies the Bethe equations,\nthen the set (1, \u03bc1 , . . . \u03bcf ) also must satisfy the Bethe\nequations, and moreover, both sets have the same energy\nE. It is straightforward to check that the states associated with these two sets are related by \u03c6(f +1) = Q+ \u03c6(f ) .\n\nresembles a N\u00e9el state for a Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet.\nIt is not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian: the full ground\nstate is disordered. However, like the N\u00e9el state, we expect this state to be a part of the ground state. Our\nderivations of fGS = int((N +1)/3) confirm this intuition.\nThis heuristic picture also gives the fermion numbers of\nthe low-lying excited states. The excitations include defects (domain walls) in the N\u00e9el-like state, such as\n*** \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6\u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u2022 \u25e6 \u25e6 ...\nThe fermion number of this configuration is just one\nhigher than that of the N\u00e9el-like state, and it has three\nidentical defects. Since defects can be moved arbitrarily\nfar apart with no change in the potential, it is natural to\ntreat each defect as a quasiparticle with charge 1/3. The\nexistence of fractional charge in 1 + 1 dimensions is an\nold story; this was first discovered in field theory [7].\nFinally, we give the field theory describing the continuum limit of (6). When taking N large, one can rewrite\nthe Bethe equations in terms of densities of roots [5],\nand then derive integral equations (known as thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations) yielding the free energy.\nOur model has the same thermodynamic equations as\nthe XXZ chain at \u2206 = 1/2, so the two models coincide\n\n\f4\nin the continuum limit. The continuum limit of the XXZ\nchain is described by the massless Thirring model [8], or\nequivalently a free massless boson \u03a6 with action [9]\nZ\n\u0003\n\u0002\n2g\nS=\ndx dt (\u2202t \u03a6)2 \u2212 (\u2202x \u03a6)2 .\n\u03c0\nThe continuum limit of the \u2206 = 1/2 model has g = 2/3;\nthis is the simplest field theory with N = (2, 2) superconformal symmetry [9]. The (2, 2) means that there are\ntwo left and two right-moving supersymmetries: in the\ncontinuum limit the fermion decomposes into left- and\nright-moving components over the Fermi sea. The boson\nalso can be decoupled into left and right pieces, so that\ne = g(\u03a6L \u2212 \u03a6R ). The\n\u03a6 = \u03a6L + \u03a6R , while its dual \u03a6\nstates of the field theory are given by the vertex opere of conformal dimensions\nators Vm,n = exp(im\u03a6 + in\u03a6),\n2\nhL,R = (m \u00b1 gn) /(4g). The four components of the\nDirac fermion in the Thirring model are V\u00b11,\u00b11/2 , while\nthe supersymmetry generators are Q\u00b1\nL = V\u00b11,\u00b13/2 and\nQ\u00b1\n=\nV\n.\nIn\na\nfinite\nsize\nL,\nthe lowest-energy\n\u00b11,\u22133/2\nR\nstate is in the Neveu-Schwarz sector, where the Thirring\nfermion has anti-periodic boundary conditions. This\nstate has EN S = \u2212\u03c0/(6L). The lowest-energy states in\nthe Ramond (periodic boundary conditions) sector are\ngiven by |\u00b1iR = V0,\u00b11/2 |0iN S ; both have energy zero.\nStates in this conformal field theory can be built up by\noperating with the \"spinons\" V\u00b11/3,\u00b11/2 .\nComparing this superconformal field theory with the\nlattice model on N = 3p sites, we identify our two E =\n0 ground states with the two Ramond vacua; all other\nstates of the lattice model are in the Ramond sector as\nwell. The U (1) quantum number m corresponds to f \u2212\nN/3 (the fermion number relative to the ground state).\nThe spinons here have charge \u00b11/3, so it is natural to\nidentify these with the fractionally-charged excitations in\nthe lattice model.\nOne can define a quantum dimer model by placing the\nvariables c\u2020i on the links instead of the sites of a lattice.\nThe product in P<i> is then over links which meet the\nlink i, and the projections are precisely such that overlapping dimers are avoided. On the N = 3p-site chain,\nthe ground states have dimer number Nd = N/3, which is\n2/3 of the value for close-packed dimers. A more involved\nexample is that of the supersymmetric dimer model on a\n2-leg ladder with N + 1 rungs. Using cohomology techniques, we found that the number NGS of ground states\ngrows quickly with N , and that not all ground states have\nthe same dimer number Nd , leading to (partial) cancellations in the Witten index W . For example, for N = 7\none finds five E = 0 ground states with Nd = 5, 5, 5, 5, 6,\nso W = \u22123. Our results, asymptotically precise for N\nlarge, are NGS \u223c (1.395)N and W \u223c (1.356)N . These\nhuge degeneracies suggest additional symmetries in the\nmodel. It will be interesting to see if supersymmetry can\nbe of use in other quantum dimer models [10].\nFollowing the ideas above, one can obtain other super-\n\nsymmetric models by including more projectors in (3), or\nby including several species of fermions. Consider a twospecies model, with fermions labeled by + and \u2212, and\nwith the conditions that (i) a single site may not be occupied by two particles and (ii) same-type particles may\nnot occupy nearest neighbor sites. On a periodic chain\nwith 4n sites, the Witten index of this model turns out\nto be W = 3, and we have strong indications that the\ncontinuum limit of this theory is the second model (at\nc = 3/2) of the series of N =2 minimal superconformal\nfield theories. A typical ground state pattern is\n...\u25e6 + \u25e6 \u2212 \u25e6 + \u25e6 \u2212 \u25e6 + \u25e6 \u2212 \u25e6 ...\nand one recognizes the possibility of domain walls of\ncharge \u00b11/2 (\u25e6 + \u2212 \u25e6) and neutral defects (+ \u25e6 +).\nThe +/\u2212 pattern indicates an Ising substructure in the\nmodel, in accord with the fact that the c = 3/2 N = 2\nminimal model can be written in terms of a Majorana\nfermion and a free boson.\nWe finally remark that in our models, the space of\nstates is made up solely of fermions on which the supersymmetry acts non-linearly. (This does not preclude a\nlinear realization on bosons and fermions in the continuum theory.) Such realizations of N = 2 lattice supersymmetry seem very different from other known realizations, for example in lattice gauge theory [11].\nAcknowledgements: It is a pleasure to thank\nBernard Nienhuis, Erik Verlinde and Alexander Schrijver\nfor discussions.
