Let E/k be an elliptic curve with CM by O. We determine a\nformula for (a generalization of) the arithmetic local constant of [5] at almost\nall primes of good reduction. We apply this formula to the CM curves defined\nover Q and are able to describe extensions F/Q over which the O-rank of E\ngrows.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet p be an odd rational prime. Let k \u2282 K \u2282 L be a tower of number fields,\nwith K/k quadratic, L/K p-power cyclic, and L/k Galois with a dihedral Galois\ngroup, i.e. a lift of 1 6= c \u2208 Gal(K/k) acts by conjugation on g \u2208 Gal(L/K) as\ncgc\u22121 = g \u22121 . In [5] Mazur and Rubin define arithmetic local constants \u03b4v , one for\neach prime v of K, which describe the growth in Z-rank of E over the extension\nL/K. Specifically (cf. [5, Theorem 6.4]), for \u03c7 : Gal(L/K) \u0592\u2192 Q\u0304\u00d7 an injective\ncharacter and S a set of primes of K containing all primes above p, all primes\nramified in L/K, and all primes where E has bad reduction,\nX\n(1.1)\nrankZ[\u03c7] E(L)\u03c7 \u2212 rankZ E(K) \u2261\n\u03b4v (mod 2) .\nv\u2208S\n\nTo phrase their result this way, we must assume the Shafarevich-Tate Conjecture1,\nand we keep this assumption throughout.\nIn [1], the theory of arithmetic local constants is generalized to address the Orank of varieties with complex multiplication (CM) by an order O, and we continue\nin that direction with specific attention to the elliptic curve case. Following [1], we\nassume that O \u2282 EndK (E) is the maximal order in a quadratic imaginary field K,\np is unramified in O, and Oc = O\u2020 = O where \u2020 indicates the action of the Rosati\ninvolution (see [6, \u00a7I.14]). When K 6\u2282 k, these assumptions imply K = kK.\nOur present aim is to provide a simple formula for the local constants \u03b4v (see\nDefinition 2.2) for primes v \u2224 p of good reduction. We then will use a result ([1,\n\u00a76]) which generalizes (1.1), with Z replaced by O, to determine conditions under\nwhich the O-rank of E grows.

Computing the local constant\n2\n\nSuppose p splits in O, i.e. pO = p1 p2 , with p1 6= p2 . We denote R = O/pO and\nRi = O/pi for i = 1, 2, so that R \u223c\n= R1 \u2295 R2 .\nDefinition 2.1. If M is an O-module of exponent p, define the R-rank of M by\nrankR M := (rankR1 M \u2297R R1 , rankR2 M \u2297R R2 ).\n\nThe following definition is the same as in [1] and [5]. Fix a prime v of K and let\nu and w be primes of k below v and of L above v, respectively. Denote ku , Kv , and\nLw for the completions of k, K, and L at u, v, and w, respectively. If Lw 6= Kv ,\nlet L\u2032w be the extension of Kv inside Lw with [Lw : L\u2032w ] = p, and otherwise let\nL\u2032w = Lw = Kv .\nDefinition 2.2. Define the arithmetic local constant \u03b4v := \u03b4(v, E, L/K) by\n\u03b4v \u2261 rankR E(Kv )/(E(Kv ) \u2229 NLw /L\u2032w E(Lw )) (mod 2) .\nNow, we will consider primes v of K such that E has good reduction at v, v \u2224 p,\nv c = v, and v ramifies in L/K (corresponding to Lemma 6.6 of [5]). Under these\nconditions Theorem 5.6 of [5] shows that\n(2.1)\n\ndimFp E(Kv )/(E(Kv ) \u2229 NLw /L\u2032w E(Lw )) \u2261 dimFp E(Kv )[p] (mod 2) .\n\nProposition 2.4 below shows that we are able to replace dimFp by rankR in (2.1).\nWe first need Lemma 2.3, which follows Lemmas 5.4-5.5 of [5], and our proof is\nmeant only to address the change from dimFp to rankR .\nLet K and L be finite extensions of Ql , with l 6= p, and suppose L/K is a finite\nextension.\nLemma 2.3. Suppose L/K is cyclic of degree p, E is defined over K and has good\nreduction. Then\n(i) rankR E(K)/pE(K) = rankR E(K)[p].\n(ii) If L/K is ramified then E(K)/pE(K) = E(L)/pE(L) and\nNL/K E(L) = pE(K).\n(iii) If L/K is unramified then NL/K E(L) = E(K).\nProof. When l 6= p we have E(K)/pE(K) = E(K)[p\u221e ]/pE(K)[p\u221e ]. Since E(K)[p\u221e ]\nis finite, (i) follows from the exact sequence of O-modules\n0 \u2192 E(K)[p] \u2192 E(K)[p\u221e ] \u2192 pE(K)[p\u221e ] \u2192 0.\n\nThe content of (ii) and (iii) is on the level of sets, so the proof is exactly as in\nLemma 5.5 of [5].\n\u0003\nWe return to the notation of Definition 2.2.\nProposition 2.4. If v \u2224 p and Lw /Kv is nontrivial and totally ramified, then\n\u03b4v \u2261 rankR E(Kv )[p] (mod 2) .\n2The simpler case of p being inert in O, i.e. O/pO is a field, is treated similarly.\n\n\fLOCAL CONSTANTS FOR CM\n\n3\n\nProof. As in [5, proof of Thm. 5.6], Lemma 2.3(ii) yields NLw /L\u2032w E(Lw ) = pE(L\u2032w )\nand hence E(Kv ) \u2229 pE(L\u2032w ) = pE(Kv ). So by Definition 2.2 and Lemma 2.3(i)\n\u03b4v \u2261 rankR E(Kv )/pE(Kv ) \u2261 rankR E(Kv )[p] (mod 2) .\n\n\u0003\n\nNow, fix a prime v of K. We denote \u03bau for the residue field of ku , q = #\u03bau for\nthe size of finite field \u03bau , and \u1ebc for the reduction of E to \u03bau .\nProposition 2.5. Suppose v \u2224 p, v is ramified in L/K, and v c = v. If E has good\nreduction at v, then \u03b4v \u2261 (1, 1) if and only if p | #\u1ebc(\u03bau ).\n\nProof. We follow the notation of Lemma 6.6 of [5]. Since v c = v we know that\nKv /ku is quadratic, and it is unramified by Lemma 6.5(ii) of [5]. Let \u03a6 be the\nFrobenius generator of Gal(Kvur /ku ), so \u03a62 is the Frobenius of Gal(Kvur /Kv ).\nThe proof of Lemma 6.6 of [5] shows that the product of the eigenvalues \u03b1, \u03b2 of\n2\n\u03a6 on E[p] is \u22121. Also, E(Kv )[p] = E[p]\u03a6 =1 is equal (as a set) to E[p] or is trivial\ndepending on whether or not {\u03b1, \u03b2} = {1, \u22121}, respectively. Since E has CM by\nO, E[p] is a rank 1 R-module (see e.g. [10, \u00a7II.1]), so the former case yields\n\u03b4v \u2261 rankR E(Kv )[p] = (1, 1) (mod 2) .\n\nBy assumption v \u2224 p, so p is prime to the characteristic of \u03bau , and therefore the\nreduction map restricted to p-torsion is injective ([9, \u00a7VII.3]). We also know E[p] is\nunramified ([9, \u00a7VII.4]), and so the eigenvalues of \u03a6 acting on E[p] coincide (mod p)\nwith the eigenvalues of the q-power Frobenius map \u03c6q on \u1ebc[p]. We know ([9, \u00a7V])\nthat the characteristic polynomial of \u03c6q is T 2 \u2212 aT + q, where a = q + 1 \u2212 #\u1ebc(\u03bau ),\nand from the above comments q \u2261 \u22121 (mod p). Therefore, \u03a6 having eigenvalues\n\u00b11 is equivalent to a \u2261 0 (mod p) and in turn equivalent to #\u1ebc(\u03bau ) \u2261 0 (mod p).\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.6. If K 6\u2282 k then \u03b4v \u2261 (1, 1).\nProof. To see that p | #\u1ebc(\u03bau ), we show that a = 0 under our assumptions on v,\nwhere a = q + 1 \u2212 #\u1ebc(\u03bau ) as above3. The theory of complex multiplication gives\na = \u03c0u + \u03c0\u0304u for some \u03c0u \u2208 O such that \u03c0u \u03c0\u0304u = q (see e.g. Theorem 14.16 in [3],\n[10, \u00a7II.10], or [8] for a thorough discussion). As K 6\u2282 k, we have K = kK, and\nwe let \u03c8 = \u03c8E/K be the Gr\u00f6ssencharacter associated to E and K (see [10, \u00a7II.9]\nor [4]). By comparing their effect on K(E[l]), where l is prime to v, we see that\n\u03c8(v)c = \u03c8(v c ), and since v = v c we have that \u03c8(v) is fixed by c. It follows that \u03c8(v)\nis rational, the corresponding \u03c0v \u2208 O \u2282 EndK (E) is integral, and in fact \u03c0v = \u00b1q\n\u221a\nby degree arguments. In addition \u03c0u2 = \u03c0v , and we will see that \u03c0u = \u2212q is purely\nimaginary. Indeed, \u03c0u having no real part implies a = \u03c0u + \u03c0\u0304u = 0, hence\n#\u1ebc(\u03bau ) \u2261 q + 1 \u2261 0 (mod p)\n\nand \u03b4v \u2261 (1, 1) by Proposition 2.5.\n\u221a\nSuppose instead that \u03c0u = q is real4. If in addition we suppose \u03c0u is integral\nthen the reduction \u03c6q \u2208 End(\u1ebc) of \u03c0u would commute with all endomorphisms of\n3That a = 0 in this case is known (see Exercise 2.30 of [10], \u00a74 Theorem 10 of [4], or Theorem\n7.46 [7] for generalization to higher dimensional abelian varieties), we include an argument for\ncompleteness.\n4The case \u03c0 = \u2212\u221aq follows the same argument.\nu\n\n\f4\n\nSUNIL CHETTY AND LUNG LI\n\n\u1ebc. As K 6\u2282 k, there is some \u03c1 \u2208 EndK (E) such that \u03c1 6= \u03c1c and hence \u03c1\u0303 6= \u03c1\u0303c . Thus\nfor some P \u2208 \u1ebc(\u03bau ), P c = P and \u03c1\u0303(P c ) 6= \u03c1\u0303c (P ). As the action of c on \u03bau coincides\nwith that of Frobenius \u03a6\u0303, it follows that \u03c1\u0303 does not commute with \u03a6\u0303, and in turn \u03c1\u0303\ndoes not commute with the Frobenius endomorphism \u03c6q \u2208 End(\u1ebc) induced by \u03a6\u0303.\n\u221a\nIf \u03c0u = q is real and irrational, then k ( Q(\u03c0u )k \u2282 K and so c \u2208 Gal(K/k)\n\u221a\nacts non-trivially on \u03c0u , i.e. \u03c0uc = \u2212 q. It follows that\nq = NK/Q (\u03c0u ) = \u03c0u \u03c0uc = \u2212q,\n\nwhich is a contradiction, and we conclude \u03c0u is purely imaginary as desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nDefine a set SL of primes v of K by\nSL := {v | p, or v ramifies in L/K, or where E has bad reduction} .\nTheorem 2.7 (Theorem 6.1 of [1]).

If v is a prime of K and v c 6= v then\n\u03b4v \u2261 \u03b4vc and hence \u03b4v + \u03b4vc \u2261 (0, 0) (mod 2) by Lemma 5.1 of [5]. If v c = v\nand v is unramified in L/K, then v splits completely in L/K by Lemma 6.5(i) of\n[5]. It follows that NLw /L\u2032w is surjective and so \u03b4v \u2261 (0, 0) by Definition 2.2. The\nremainingPprimes v are precisely those named in the assumption, so Proposition\n2.6 gives v \u03b4v \u2261 (m, m) (mod 2). Thus,\nrankO[\u03c7] E(L)\u03c7 \u2261 rankO E(K) + m (mod 2)\n\nand we have assumed that the right-hand side is odd.\nFrom Corollary 3.7 of [5] it follows that\nX\nrankO E(F ) =\n(dimQ \u03c1L ) * (rankO[\u03c7] E(L)\u03c7 ).\nL\n\n5We could instead write that dim (E(F ) \u2297 Q\u0304)\u03c7 is independent of the choice of \u03c7.\nQ\u0304\n6The case K \u2282 k is similar, with m equal to the number of v such that p | #\u1ebc(\u03ba ).\nu\n\n\fLOCAL CONSTANTS FOR CM\n\n5\n\nAs the previous paragraph applies for every cyclic L/K in F , we see from the\ndecomposition of K[G] that E(F ) \u2297 Q contains a submodule isomorphic to K[G]\nand the claim follows.\n\u0003\n3. CM elliptic curves defined over Q\nHere, we will consider the CM elliptic curves E defined over Q (as in [10, A.3]).\nFor each E, our aim is to determine7 examples of dihedral towers Q \u2282 K \u2282 F over\nwhich, according to Theorem 2.8, the O-rank of E grows. As we have assumed\nO \u2282 EndK (E), we will consider towers in which K = K (see \u00a71). All of our\ncalculations will be done using Sage [11].\nLet ED /Q\u221abe the elliptic curve of minimal conductor8 defined over Q with CM\nby KD = Q( \u2212D). We determine computationally9 rankZ ED (KD ), and for D = 3\nwe see that this group is finite. For D = 4, 7, the situation is less certain, as Sage\nonly tells us that ED (Q) is finite and rankZ ED (KD ) \u2264 2. For each of the remaining\nCM curves ED defined over Q, one can (provably) calculate that rankZ ED (Q) = 1.\nWe also have that rankZ ED (KD ) \u2265 rankZ ED (Q) = 1 and rankZ ED (KD ) cannot\nbe even, so rankO ED (KD ) \u2265 1. For D = 8, 11, 19, 43, 67, and 163, Sage gives an\nupper bound7 of 3 for rankZ ED (KD ) and so for these D we can conclude that in\nfact rankO ED (KD ) = 1.\n3.1. Dihedral Extensions of Q. Recall that p is a fixed odd rational prime.\nPresently, we also fix D \u2208 {3, 4, 7, . . . , 163} and let E = ED , K = KD . We are\ninterested in abelian extensions F/K which are dihedral over Q, and these are\nexactly the extensions contained in the ring class fields of K (see [3], Theorem\n9.18).\nLet Of be an order in OK of conductor f . We have a simple formula for the\nclass number h(Of ) of Of using, for example, Theorem 7.24 of [3], and noting that\nwe have h(OK ) = 1,\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0013\nY \u0012\n\u2212D 1\nf\n1\n\u2212\n.\n*\nh(Of ) = \u00d7\nl\nl\n[OK : Of\u00d7 ]\nprimes l|f\n\n\u00d7\nOK\n\n\u00d7\nFor D 6= 3, 4 we have\n= {\u00b11} and for D = 4 we have #OK\n= 4, so in both of\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\n\u00d7\nthese cases [OK : Of ] is prime to p. For D = 3, one can show that [OK\n: Of\u00d7 ] = 3\nwhen f > 1. The following paragraphs require only minor adjustments for the case\np = D = 3.\nTaking f to be an odd rational prime such that (\u2212D/f ) = \u00b11, the class number becomes h(Of ) = f \u2213 1 and so the ring class field HOf associated to Of is\nan abelian extension of K of degree f \u2213 1. Thus, for f \u2261 \u00b11 (mod p) we have a\n(non-trivial) p-power subextension F/K which is dihedral over Q.\nNext we need to understand the ramification in F/K. As K has class number\n1, we know there are no unramified extensions of K, and so we must ensure that\nF satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 2.8. A prime v of K ramifies in HOf /K if\nand only if v | f OK (see for example exercise 9.20 in [3] and recall f is odd). If\nwe choose f so that \u2212D is not a square (mod f ), f is inert in K/Q, and so f OK\n7Determined up to the correspondence of class field theory.\n8See p.483 of [10], with f = 1 (in Silverman's notation), for a Weierstrauss equation.\n9Specifically with Sage's interface to John Cremona's 'mwrank' and Denis Simon's\n\n'simon_two_descent.'\n\n\f6\n\nSUNIL CHETTY AND LUNG LI\n\nis prime and moreover the only prime that ramifies in HOf /K. If f OK does not\nramify in F/K then the p-extension F/K is contained in the Hilbert class field HK\nof K. As HK = K, this is impossible, so f OK ramifies in F/K and no other primes\nramify in F/K. Taking f such that f \u2224 D and \u2212D is a square (mod f ), we have\nthat f is not inert and does not ramify in K/Q. As in the previous case, the primes\nof K above f both ramify in the p-extension F/K contained in HOf .\nNow, suppose rankO E(K) is odd10. To apply Theorem 2.8, we must have an\neven number m of primes v such that v c = v, v ramifies in F/K, E has good\nreducation at v and for which p | #\u1ebc(Z/f Z). First, we can guarantee m = 0 if the\nonly primes v which ramify in F/K do not satisfy v c = v, e.g. taking f \u2224 D with\n(\u2212D/f ) = 1. Table 3.1 below gives, for each D and for p = 3, 5, 7, the smallest\nprime f which gives an extension of degree p following this recipe. We note that\nwe do not need Proposition 2.5 for this case.\nIf we wish to allow for primes v satisfying v c = v, we choose two p-extensions\nF1 , F2 from two distinct rational primes fi as above with fi \u2261 \u22121 (mod p) and\n(\u2212D/fi ) = \u22121, for i = 1, 2. The compositum F = F1 F2 will satisfy our requirements. Indeed, firstly F is an abelian p-extension of K and is contained\nin the ring class field HOf1 f2 , hence dihedral over Q with only f1 OK and f2 OK\nramifying in F/K. Secondly, as each fi is inert in K/Q, each is a supersingular\nprime for E (this follows from the arguments in Corollary 2.6) and hence p divides\n#\u1ebc(Z/fi Z) = fi + 1. Thus, E and the p-extension F/K satisfy the hypotheses of\nTheorem 2.8. Table 3.2 below gives, for each D and for p = 3, 5, 7, the smallest pair\nof distinct primes f1 , f2 which give extensions of degree p2 following this recipe.\nNext, suppose rankO E(K) is even.11 In this case, we need m to be odd in order\nto apply Theorem 2.8. The same ideas as above still work, and in Table 3.3 we\nlist, for each D and for p = 3, 5, 7, the smallest prime f for which Theorem 2.8\nguarantees rank \u2265 p.\nRemark 3.1. Though there are algorithms in the literature to compute the defining\npolynomial of a class field (e.g. [2, \u00a76], [3, \u00a7\u00a711-3]) and such computational problems\nare of interest independently, we make no attempt here to explicitly determine the\nring class fields HOf . As is apparent from Table 3.2, our method of determining\na field to which Theorem 2.8 applies involves ring class fields of large degree in a\ncomputationally inefficient way.\nReferences\n[1] S.
