Introduction and conclusions\nThere has recently been a lot of interest in the embedding of the\nMelvin universe [20] in M/string theory [16], in particular in the type\nIIA flux 7-brane (F7-brane), whose M-theory description [10, 8, 9, 17]\nstrongly suggests that type IIA string theory with magnetic field Ms2 /gs2\nis dual to type 0A string theory [6, 1]. They also play an important\nrole in the supergravity description of the expansion of a Dp-brane\ninto a spherical D(p + 2)-brane due to the dielectric effect [7] and in\nEMPG-01-17, WIS/20/01-OCT-DPP.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\nthe possible stabilisation of tubular branes [11, 4]. The study of analogous magnetic backgrounds allowing a conformal field theory description [23, 24, 29] provides a framework to study the decay of unstable\nbackgrounds into stable supersymmetric ones since they are smoothly\nconnected to the supersymmetric closed string vacuum. Related work\ncan also be found in [21, 25, 5, 26, 27, 28].\nIt was pointed out in [17, 30] that when several magnetic parameters are taken into account the corresponding supergravity background\nmay preserve some amount of supersymmetry. One of the goals of this\npaper is to classify these possibilities, or equivalently, to classify supersymmetric fluxbranes in string theory. To do so, we shall reexamine\nthe geometrical setting giving rise to the flux-fivebrane (or F5-brane,\nfor short) [17] in the context of Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions. Starting\nwith eleven-dimensional Minkowski space, the F5-brane is obtained by\nconsidering a Kaluza\u2013Klein reduction along the orbits generated by\na Killing vector consisting of a translation and a rotation. The reduction will preserve some supersymmetry if the rotation belongs to\nthe isotropy algebra of some nonzero Killing spinor of the Minkowski\nvacuum. This suggests considering the Kaluza\u2013Klein reduction by the\nmost general Killing vector in Minkowski space subject to some natural\nconditions, namely that the quotient be a smooth lorentzian manifold.\nThis problem has been addressed in [9], although there no particular\nattention has been paid to supersymmetric fluxbranes or to Lorentz\ntransformations other than spatial rotations. The space of Killing vectors is of course isomorphic to the Poincar\u00e9 algebra, and the reductions\nsatisfying these conditions form a subset of this algebra. Generic points\nin this parameter space will break supersymmetry completely, but there\nare special loci for which supersymmetry is preserved. In this paper we\ndetermine these loci. There are two families of solutions intersecting\nin a common two-parameter family.\nAny translation preserves supersymmetry, but a Lorentz transformation which does must belong to the isotropy algebra of some spinor.\nIn dimension greater than two, there are three types of (pure) Lorentz\ntransformations: boosts, rotations and null rotations. Only null rotations and some \"special\" rotations preserve spinors. Reductions involving these special rotations generate type IIA configurations which can\nbe interpreted as flux p-branes (or Fp-branes, for short) for p = 1, 3, 5,\nbut we also have the possibility of reducing along null rotations. This\ngives rise to configurations which we call nullbranes (or Np-branes) as\nthey have a null RR 2-form field strength. Whereas supersymmetric\nfluxbranes can be interpreted as intersections of F7-branes, nullbranes\ncan be thought of infinitely boosted F7-branes1 , even though their\nphysical interpretation is not clear to us at the present time, these\nbeing time dependent backgrounds in string theory preserving one half\n1\n\nJS would like to thank M. Berkooz for suggesting this interpretation.\n\n\fSUPERSYMMETRIC FLUXBRANES\n\n3\n\nof the spacetime supersymmetry. Reductions along linear combinations of the Killing vectors giving rise to the flux/null-branes are also\npossible. The type IIA configurations obtained in this way interpolate\ncontinuously between the fluxbranes and nullbranes discussed before.\nThe formulation developed in this paper allows an immediate extension to many other supersymmetric M-theory backgrounds. This\nis discussed and applied to M-brane backgrounds and their intersections in a separate article [15], in which we construct supersymmetric\ncomposite configurations of type IIA/B branes (D-branes, fundamental strings, NS5-branes, waves, etc) and flux/null-branes. In a second\nforthcoming article we consider supersymmetric reductions of the maximally supersymmetric M-theory backgrounds of AdS type [14].\nThere remain many interesting open questions regarding F-branes\nsuch as which D-brane configurations are possible in these backgrounds\n(or their U-duals) and which is the corresponding field theory one can\ndefine on them in certain decoupling limits. Furthermore, while standard D-branes admit an open string description on flat space, the existence of such a description for F-branes remains an open question.\nThis paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the\ngeometric context of the present paper: namely the supersymmetric\nKaluza\u2013Klein reduction of the flat M-theory vacuum and we classify\nthose reductions resulting in supersymmetric smooth IIA backgrounds,\nwhat we call (smooth, generalised) supersymmetric IIA fluxbranes.\nWe will see that there are two families of generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes: one family contains the supersymmetric fluxbranes recently discussed in [17, 30, 22] and in addition a novel 14 -BPS fluxstring\nsolution, and the other family contains new solutions called here nullbranes as well as new solutions which interpolate between them and\nsome of the known fluxbranes. We can summarise the possible generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes as follows. As elementary objects,\nwe have a 12 -BPS F5-brane, a 12 -BPS N7-brane, a 14 -BPS F3-brane, a\n1\n-BPS F1-brane and an 18 -BPS F1-brane. We also find interpolating\n4\nsolutions (which we call generalised fluxbranes): a 14 -BPS solution interpolating between the F5- and the N7-branes and a 18 -BPS solution\ninterpolating between the F3- and the N7-branes. All these geometries\nare constructed explicitly in Section 3. Finally Section 4 contains a\ncomprehensive analysis of the U-dual configurations which can be obtained from the solutions constructed in Section 3. This is illustrated\nwith the aid of diagrams showing the U-duality orbits of some of the\nelementary fluxbranes.\nNote added. There is some overlap between the results in this\npaper and those in [22], which appeared as we were completing the\npresent work.\n\n\f4\n\nFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\n2. Kaluza\u2013Klein reduction and generalised fluxbranes\nWe start by considering Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions of the maximally\nsupersymmetric vacuum of M-theory described by eleven-dimensional\nMinkowski space, and in this way classify all the smooth supersymmetric solutions of type IIA supergravity which are Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions of the M-theory vacuum. These geometries will be described\nexplicitly in the next section.\n2.1. The geometrical setting. The general geometrical setting is\nthe following (see also [9]). We will consider a one-parameter subgroup\nof the group of isometries of Minkowski space, in other words a onedimensional subgroup G of the Poincar\u00e9 group acting on Minkowski\nspace. Topologically, G is either a circle or a line. In traditional treatments of Kaluza\u2013Klein reduction, G is always taken to be a circle subgroup; but circles do not act freely on Minkowski space. It is possible\nto follow tradition and demand that G be a circle; but in order to\nhave a smooth quotient, one is forced to introduce \"identifications\"\nin Minkowski space which effectively close the integral curves of the\nKilling vector generating the action. This practice is standard in the\ncontext of fluxbranes, and although it has its merits, we prefer not to\nfollow it here. To restate, all our solutions will be smooth quotients of\nMinkowski space by the action of G \u223c\n= R. If desired, these solutions\ncould be viewed as Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions on a circle. Indeed, quotienting by R can be done in two steps: quotienting by Z (i.e., making\nidentifications in Minkowski space) and then quotienting by the circle\nR/Z. The action of Z introduces a length scale in the problem, which\nis (2\u03c0 times) the radius of the circle.\nIf the G-action is free and has spacelike orbits2 , the ten-dimensional\nspace obtained by Kaluza\u2013Klein reduction will be a solution of the type\nIIA supergravity. In addition, this solution will be supersymmetric provided that G leaves some spinor invariant. Let \u03be be the Killing vector\ngenerating the G action infinitesimally. The action will be (locally)\nfree if and only if \u03be is nowhere-vanishing. With our choice of (mostly\nplus) metric, demanding that the norm k\u03bek2 be everywhere positive\nguarantees that the orbits are spacelike. Under further mild restrictions (namely that every point in Minkowski space should have trivial\nstabiliser) the space of orbits will be a smooth manifold inheriting a\nlorentzian metric.\n2\n\nSince we want to induce a metric in the space of orbits, it is important that the\nKilling vector never be null; hence it has to be always spacelike or always timelike.\nSince we are interested in constructing solutions of type II supergravity in signature\n(9,1) we restrict ourselves to spacelike orbits. Nothing prevents us from considering\ntimelike orbits and in this way obtain fluxbrane solutions of euclidean supergravity\ntheories of the type considered in [18], but this will be left for another time.\n\n\fSUPERSYMMETRIC FLUXBRANES\n\n5\n\nIn adapted coordinates, where \u03be = \u2202z , we can write the elevendimensional Minkowski metric as\nds2 (E10,1 ) = e\u22122\u03c6/3 g + e4\u03c6/3 (dz + A)2 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is the ten-dimensional metric in the string frame, \u03c6 is the\ndilaton and A is the RR 1-form potential of type IIA supergravity. By\nconstruction, the triple (g, \u03c6, A) will satisfy the equations of motion\nof IIA supergravity, provided that we set the other field strengths F3\nand F4 in the theory to zero. This solution will be supersymmetric\nif and only if \u03be preserves some Killing spinors. In the case where we\nmake identifications in Minkowski space in order to view this as a circle\nreduction, it is convenient to introduce a length scale R, the radius of\nthe circle, and then write z = R\u03c7, where \u03c7 is an angular variable taking\nvalues in R/2\u03c0Z. In this case, it is also convenient to rescale the RR\n1-form potential, so that the metric becomes the more familiar\nds2 (E10,1 ) = e\u22122\u03c6/3 g + e4\u03c6/3 R2 (d\u03c7 + C(1) )2 .\n\n(2)\n\nThe Killing vector \u03be acts on a Killing spinor \u03b5 via the spinorial Lie\nderivative (see, e.g., [19] and also [12]), defined by\nL\u03be \u03b5 = \u2207\u03be \u03b5 + 41 \u2207a \u03beb\u0393ab \u03b5 .\n\n(3)\n\nSince Killing spinors are parallel in the Minkowski vacuum, the condition that \u03be preserves supersymmetry becomes the algebraic condition\nthat, for some nonzero parallel spinor \u03b5,\n1\n\u2207 \u03be \u0393ab \u03b5\n4 a b\n\n=0.\n\n(4)\n\nAlternatively, relative to adapted coordinates, a spinor is invariant under \u03be = \u2202z if and only if it does not depend explicitly on z.\nThe most general Killing vector in Minkowski space is the sum of a\ntranslation and a Lorentz transformation:\n\u03be = a\u03bc \u2202\u03bc + 12 \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd (x\u03bc \u2202\u03bd \u2212 x\u03bd \u2202\u03bc ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03c9 \u03bd\u03bc , and the condition (4) guaranteeing the preservation\nof supersymmetry becomes\n1 \u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c9 \u03a3\u03bc\u03bd \u03b5\n4\n\n=0.\n\n(6)\n\nIn other words, we see that the translation can be arbitrary and that\nthe Lorentz transformation must belong to the isotropy algebra of a\nspinor.\nFor the purposes of this paper, by a (generalised) fluxbrane we will\nmean a smooth solution of IIA supergravity obtained as the Kaluza\u2013\nKlein reduction of eleven-dimensional Minkowski space. In what follows we will classify these and construct two multiparameter families\nof generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes containing as special cases all\nthe supersymmetric fluxbranes which have been hitherto considered in\nthe literature.\n\n\f6\n\nFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\n2.2. Classification of smooth supersymmetric fluxbranes. Let\nus outline the mathematical problem of classifying supersymmetric generalised fluxbranes (of type IIA supergravity). This problem reduces\nto finding free actions of a group G \u223c\n= R on Minkowski space preserving the metric, leaving some parallel spinors invariant and possessing\nspacelike orbits. In other words, we are interested in classifying oneparameter subgroups of the spinor isotropy groups of (the spin cover of)\nthe Poincar\u00e9 group, which act freely on Minkowski space with spacelike\norbits, up to conjugation.\nIt is more convenient to work in terms of the Lie algebra. Killing\nvectors in Minkowski space are in one-to-one correspondence with the\nPoincar\u00e9 algebra p = l \u22c9 t \u223c\n= so(10, 1) \u22c9 R10,1 , where l is the Lorentz\nsubalgebra and t is the translation ideal. Let m \u2282 p denote the subset\ncorresponding to Killing vectors \u03be which obey the following conditions\n1. k\u03bek2 = g(\u03be, \u03be) > 0; and\n2. \u03be preserves some spinors.\nNotice that if \u03be \u2208 m then s\u03be \u2208 m for any nonzero real number s.\nAlthough there is physics in the scale s, it is convenient for classification\npurposes to identify any two collinear Killing vectors, as they have\nthe same orbits, but parametrised differently. We therefore introduce\nthe moduli space M of supersymmetric Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions of flat\nspace as the real projective space of the subset m. We now proceed to\ndetermine M.\nLet \u03be be a Killing vector and let us write it uniquely as\n\u03be =\u03c4 +\u03bb ,\nwhere \u03c4 \u2208 t is a translation and \u03bb \u2208 l is a Lorentz transformation. The\ntranslation component cannot be zero, since every Lorentz transformation fixes a point (the \"origin\") and hence vanishes there. Moreover,\nsince k\u03bek2 = k\u03c4 k2 at the origin, condition (1) above says that \u03c4 must\nbe spacelike at the origin, and hence everywhere. Our strategy to determine the moduli space M will be the following: we will find a normal\nform for \u03be exploiting the freedom to conjugate by the Poincar\u00e9 group,\nand then impose the conditions on the normal form.\nBy conjugating with a Lorentz transformation we can bring \u03bb to\na normal form. Which form depends on the type of element it is.\nA generic \u03bb \u2208 so(10, 1) fixes one direction. This direction can be\nspacelike, timelike or null. Accordingly, \u03bb can take one of the following\nthree normal forms:\n(spacelike)\n\u03bb = B01 (\u03b3) + R23 (\u03b21 ) + R45 (\u03b22 ) + R67 (\u03b23 ) + R89 (\u03b24 ) ;\n\n(7)\n\n(timelike)\n\u03bb = R12 (\u03b21 ) + R34 (\u03b22 ) + R56 (\u03b23 ) + R78 (\u03b24 ) + R9\u266e (\u03b25 ) ;\n\n(8)\n\n\fSUPERSYMMETRIC FLUXBRANES\n\n7\n\n(null)\n\u03bb = N+1 (u) + R23 (\u03b21 ) + R45 (\u03b22 ) + R67 (\u03b23 ) + R89 (\u03b24 ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u00b1 = \u266e \u00b1 0 with \u266e the tenth spacelike direction, Rij (\u03b2) is an\ninfinitesimal rotation with parameter \u03b2 in the (ij) plane, B0i (\u03b3) is an\ninfinitesimal boost with parameter \u03b3 along the ith direction and N+i (u)\nis a null rotation with parameter u in the ith direction.\nBringing \u03bb to one of these normal forms does not use up all the\nfreedom of conjugation, since we can still conjugate by those elements\nof the Poincar\u00e9 group which fix the normal form. All normal forms are\nfixed under conjugation by translations, which corresponds to changing\nthe origin in Minkowski space. It is possible to change the origin in\norder the bring the translation \u03c4 to normal form. This normal form\ndepends on \u03bb. Under a change of origin,\n\u03be = \u03c4 + \u03bb 7\u2192 \u03c4 + [\u03bb, \u03c4 \u2032 ] + \u03bb ,\nwhence we can, by choosing the origin appropriately, get rid of any\ncomponent of \u03c4 in the image of [\u03bb, \u2212].\nIf \u03bb has normal form (7), by a change of origin and a rescaling (which\nwe are allowed to do since the moduli space M is projective) we can\nalways choose \u03c4 = \u2202\u266e . In particular this means that as vector fields in\nMinkowski space, \u03c4 and \u03bb are orthogonal, whence\nk\u03bek2 = k\u03c4 k2 + k\u03bbk2 .\nIt is easy to see that if the boost parameter \u03b3 6= 0 then there are points\nin Minkowski space where \u03be is not spacelike: simply take |x1 | large\nenough. Therefore for spacelike orbits, we require \u03b3 = 0, whence \u03bb also\nfixes a timelike direction, so it is a special case of the normal form (8).\nIf \u03bb has normal form (8) and all \u03b2's are different from zero, there\nexists a choice of origin in which \u03c4 is timelike, violating one of the above\nconditions. Therefore at most four \u03b2's can be nonzero and hence there\nexist coordinates in which, after rescaling, \u03be = \u2202\u266e + \u03bb, where \u03bb takes\nthe form\n\u03bb = R12 (\u03b21 ) + R34 (\u03b22 ) + R56 (\u03b23 ) + R78 (\u03b24 ) \u2208 so(8) .\nNow, supersymmetry never constrains the translation component, but\nit does impose constraints on \u03bb. Here \u03bb \u2208 so(8) preserves a spinor\nif and only if it belongs to a spin(7) subalgebra. By permuting the\ncoordinates if necessary, this condition translates into the vanishing of\nthe sum of the \u03b2's. This gives rise to a three-parameter family of vector\nfields\n\u03be = \u2202\u266e + R12 (\u03b21 ) + R34 (\u03b22 ) + R56 (\u03b23 ) + R78 (\u03b24 ) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b24 = 0.\nFinally if \u03bb has normal form (9), we must again have some parameter\namong u, \u03b2i vanishing, for otherwise by a suitable change of origin\nwe could set \u03c4 = a\u2202\u2212 , violating the condition that \u03c4 be spacelike.\n\n\f8\n\nFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\nTherefore either u or one of the \u03b2's must vanish. If u = 0 we are back\nin the case treated previously. Therefore let us assume that u 6= 0\nand that \u03b24 = 0, say. By choosing the origin suitably we can write\n\u03be = \u03c4 + \u03bb, where\n\u03c4 = a\u2202\u2212 + b\u22028 + c\u22029\n\nand \u03bb = N+1 (u) + R23 (\u03b21 ) + R45 (\u03b22 ) + R67 (\u03b23 ) .\n\nThe condition that \u03c4 be spacelike forces either b or c to be nonzero.\nMoreover the condition that \u03be be spacelike forces a = 0. To see this\nsimply notice that\nk\u03bek2 = k\u03c4 k2 + k\u03bbk2 + 2g(\u03c4, \u03bb)\n= k\u03c4 k2 + k\u03bbk2 \u2212 2aux1 ,\nwhere k\u03c4 k2 > 0, k\u03bbk2 \u2265 0 are independent of x1 and hence if we take\n|x1 | large enough we eventually find that k\u03bek2 is not positive. Therefore\nin some coordinates, and after rescaling,\n\u03be = \u22029 + N+1 (u) + R23 (\u03b21 ) + R45 (\u03b22 ) + R67 (\u03b23 ) .\nIt remains to impose that \u03be preserves some spinors. This means that\nfor some nonzero spinor \u03b5, its Lie derivative L\u03be \u03b5 along \u03be vanishes. Using\n(6) this is equivalent to the algebraic equation\n(u\u03a3+1 + \u03b21 \u03a323 + \u03b22 \u03a345 + \u03b23 \u03a367 ) \u03b5 = 0 .\nTo solve it, notice that this equation is of the form\n(N + S)\u03b5 = 0 ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere N = u\u03a3+1 is nilpotent (in fact, N 2 = 0) and S = \u03b21 \u03a323 +\u03b22 \u03a345 +\n\u03b23 \u03a367 is semisimple and moreover N and S commute. As a result, (11)\nis true if and only if\nN\u03b5 = 0\n\nand\n\nS\u03b5 = 0 .\n\nThe first equation says that \u0393+ \u03b5 = 0 and the second equation says\nthat S \u2208 so(6) is actually in an su(3) subalgebra. Again, up to a\npermutation of the coordinates, this means that the sum of the \u03b2's\nvanishes.\nWe can summarise the above results as follows. There are two families of spacelike Killing vectors in Minkowski space which induce supersymmetric Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions. There exists a coordinate system\n(z, y i , y \u00b1 ), with i = 1, . . . , 8, where the metric takes the form\nds2 (E10,1 ) = 2dy + dy \u2212 +\n\n8\nX\n\ndy i dy i + dz 2\n\n(12)\n\ni=1\n\nand where, to an overall scale, the two families of Killing vectors are\ngiven by\nX\n\u03be = \u2202z + R12 (\u03b21 ) + R34 (\u03b22 ) + R56 (\u03b23 ) + R78 (\u03b24 ) ,\n\u03b2i = 0 ,\ni\n\n(13)\n\n\fSUPERSYMMETRIC FLUXBRANES\n\n9\n\nand by\n\u03be = \u2202z + N+1 (u) + R34 (\u03b21\u2032 ) + R56 (\u03b22\u2032 ) + R78 (\u03b23\u2032 ) ,\n\nX\n\n\u03b2i\u2032 = 0 .\n\ni\n\n(14)\n\nWe should point out that the parameter u is ineffective; that is, it is\nonly important to distinguish between two cases u = 0 and u 6= 0. In\nthis latter case, we can set u to any desired nonzero value by rescaling\ny \u00b1 7\u2192 c\u00b11 y \u00b1 for a suitable c. Such rescalings are of course Lorentz\ntransformations.\nTo complete the proof that these vector fields give rise to smooth\nreductions, we must ensure that the integrated action is free: meaning\nthat no point is left fixed and every point has trivial stabiliser. Indeed,\nthe action on Minkowski space of the element exp t\u03be in the subgroup\nG\u223c\n= R generated by \u03be takes the form\n(z, y \u03bc ) 7\u2192 (z + t, \u039b(t)\u03bc \u03bd y \u03bd ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhence the action is manifestly free. This means that the space of\norbits E10,1 /G is smooth. Let us now describe the explicit geometry of\nthese supersymmetric fluxbranes.\n3. Generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes\nTo best describe the explicit geometry of the generalised supersymmetric fluxbranes obtained by reducing Minkowski space along the orbits of the Killing vectors given by equations (13) and (14), we will\nwork in coordinates adapted to the Killing vector. This turns out to\nbe very easy, once we observe that \u03be is simply a dressed version of its\ntranslation component:\n\u03be = U\u2202z U \u22121\n\nwhere U = exp (\u2212z\u03bb) .\n\n(16)\n\nLet us introduce coordinates (xi , x\u00b1 ) related to the coordinates (y i , y \u00b1 )\nby\nx=Uy .\n\n(17)\n\nIt follows easily that \u03bex = 0, so that x are good coordinates for the\nspace of orbits. Since \u03bb is an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation, the\nx are linearly related to the y with z-dependent coefficients. Indeed,\nlet us denote by B the constant 10 \u00d7 10 real matrix such that\n\u03bby = By .\n\n(18)\n\nTherefore the new coordinates are given by\nx = exp (\u2212zB) y ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere exp here means the matrix exponential. For \u03bb in either of the\nnormal forms described at the end of the last section, it is very easy\nto write an explicit expression for this matrix exponential; but we will\n\n\f10\n\nFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\nrefrain from doing so here, as it is not needed in order to write down\nthe IIA background.\nIndeed, it is a simple matter to rewrite the metric (12) in terms of\nthe new variables, obtaining\n\u0001\n(20)\nds2 (E10,1 ) = \u039b(dz + A)2 + dx\u2020 1 \u2212 \u039b\u22121 (Bx)(Bx)\u2020 dx ,\nwhere v \u2020 = v t \u03b7 is the adjoint relative to the Minkowski metric, and\n\u039b = 1 + (Bx)\u2020 (Bx)\n\nand\n\nA = \u039b\u22121 (Bx)\u2020 dx .\n\n(21)\n\nUsing the Kaluza\u2013Klein ansatz (1) we can read off the IIA background\nwhich has F3 = F4 = 0 and in the string frame the nontrivial fields are\ngiven by\n\u0001\n\u03c6 = 43 log \u039b\nand\ng = \u039b1/2 dx\u2020 1 \u2212 \u039b\u22121 (Bx)(Bx)\u2020 dx , (22)\n\ntogether with A in the previous equation, which also contains the definition of \u039b. The parameters in this solution are hidden in B, which\nis the matrix of an infinitesimal Lorentz transformation of the form\ndescribed in equations (13) or (14). As discussed in the previous section, we can always choose the x coordinates in such a way that B\nonly depends on 3 real parameters which are unconstrained; although\nin one of the cases the parameter is ineffective. We keep it because\nwe can in this way discuss the limit u \u2192 0. Some subvarieties of the\nmoduli space of supersymmetric fluxbranes are already known, as we\nnow discuss.\nTo help comparison with the literature, let us write down the matrix\nB explicitly relative to the basis {xi , x+ , x\u2212 }:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 \u2212\u03b21 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 u\n\uf8ec \u03b21\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n0 \u2212\u03b22 0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0 \u03b22 0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n0\n0\n0 \u2212\u03b23 0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n(23)\nB=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n0\n0 \u03b23 0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 \u2212\u03b24 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 \u03b24 0 0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u2212u 0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\uf8f8\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0 0 0\nwhere either u = 0 or \u03b21 = 0 (or both) and where \u03b21 + \u03b22 + \u03b23 + \u03b24 = 0.\nWe will now consider several special cases.\n3.1. Supersymmetric fluxbranes. If u = 0, so that the Lorentz\ntransformation is purely a rotation, we obtain, in addition to the standard supersymmetric fluxbranes considered previously in [17, 30, 22],\na novel fluxstring configuration preserving 1/4 of the supersymmetry.\nThe solutions described here correspond to the supersymmetric points\nin the space of solutions described in [9]; although that work did not\naddress the question of supersymmetry.\n\n\fSUPERSYMMETRIC FLUXBRANES\n\n11\n\nWe have several possibilities depending on how many of the \u03b2's are\nzero. If three \u03b2's vanish, then supersymmetry implies that all \u03b2's\nmust vanish and the resulting configuration is the type IIA vacuum.\nTherefore, if we are to obtain a nontrivial supersymmetric fluxbrane,\nat most two \u03b2's can be zero.\n3.1.1. The supersymmetric F5-brane revisited. If \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 0, and\nhence \u03b23 = \u2212\u03b24 = \u03b2, we recover the supersymmetric F5-brane of [17].\nThe matrix B corresponds to an element in the Cartan subalgebra of\nsp(1) \u2282 so(4) \u2282 so(9, 1):\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0 0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b2 0 0 0 0\uf8f7\n(24)\nB=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0 0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 \u03b2 0\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 \u03b2 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2212\u03b2 0 0 0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\uf8f8\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\nHere \u03b2 is the parameter related to the magnetic field in [17].

Dualities and flux branes\nAny supergravity background gives rise to a family of related solutions through the use of U-duality transformations and other solutiongenerating techniques. The purpose of this section is to discuss the\nfamily of solutions obtained by U-duality from some of the generalised\nfluxbranes found in the previous section, namely fluxbranes and nullbranes. It is well known that any time a T-duality transformation is\nused to generate a new solution, the latter is delocalised in the T-dual\ndirection. It is often possible to find localised versions of the new solutions, but it remains to be seen whether this is indeed true for the\nsolutions we find here. We will make much use of the T-duality rules\nderived by Bergshoeff, Hull and Ort\u0131\u0301n in [2].\n4.1. A word on the notation. In applying the T-duality rules to\nthe solutions found above, we will obtain many solutions for which no\nname yet exists. In this section we have introduced a notation in order\nto be able to identify them. Since the notation is not standard, let us\ntake a moment to explain it. By an F(p, q)-brane, we shall denote a\nsolution with full Poincar\u00e9 invariance in p + 1 dimensions, but which is\nnevertheless delocalised in q of them. A similar notation, now N(p, q) is\nemployed in the section on nullbrane dualities. Whenever an S-duality\ntransformation is applied, an s is added to the notation together with\none of the letters a or b to emphasise that this is a configuration of type\nIIA or IIB, respectively. This is done to distinguish solutions which, although formally equivalent, belong to different theories. In the section\non fluxstring dualities, we further adorn the notation with a subscript\n1 or 2, to distinguish between the two fluxstring configurations. The\nrest of the notation is standard.\n4.2. F5-brane dualities. The starting solution is the F5-brane, with\nmetric (28) and RR 1-form potential (27), whereas the dilaton is given\nby \u03c6 = 43 log(1 + \u03b2 2 r 2 ).\nBy performing a T-duality along 5 \u2212 p worldspace directions of the\nF5-brane, one obtains a family of F(p, 5 \u2212 p)-brane configurations, for\np = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, belonging to type IIA for odd p and to type IIB for\n\n\fSUPERSYMMETRIC FLUXBRANES\n\n19\n\neven p. They can be jointly described by\np\u22122\nlog \u039b ,\nG(7\u2212p) = F \u2227 dvol(E5\u2212p )\n4\ng = \u039b1/2 ds2 (Ep,1 ) + \u039b\u22121/2 ds2 (E5\u2212p ) + \u039b1/2 h ,\n\n\u03c6=\n\n(60)\n\nwhere the transverse metric h is defined as\nh = dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 2\u03b8d\u03c8 2 ) +\n\nr2\n(d\u03c6 + cos 2\u03b8d\u03c8)2 ,\n\u039b\n\n(61)\n\nand G(7\u2212p) stands for the RR field strength, F being the RR 2-form\nfield strength of the original F5-brane configuration.\nNotice that the F(2, 3)-brane is S-selfdual, whereas the F(4, 1)-brane\nis S-dual to the F(4, 1)bs-brane\n\u03c6 = \u2212 12 log \u039b ,\n2\n\n4,1\n\nH = \u2212F \u2227 dx\n\ng = ds (E ) + \u039b dx2 + h ,\n\u22121\n\n(62)\n\nwhere H is the NS-NS three-form field strength. Similarly, the F(0, 5)brane is S-dual to the F(0, 5)bs-brane\n\u03c6 = 12 log \u039b ,\n\n\u22c6H = F \u2227 dvol(E5 )\n\ng = \u039b[\u2212dt2 + h] + ds2 (E5 ) .\n\n(63)\n\nBy a T-duality along R4 in the F(4, 1)bs-brane, we obtain the F(4, 1)\nas-brane, which is formally equivalent to its T-dual. Both are T-duals\nalong the twisted directions to the corresponding vacuum solutions in\ntype IIA/B with non-trivial identifications. Similarly, the new F(0, 5)bs\n-brane configuration also generates through T-duality a new type IIA\nsolution, the F(0, 5)as-brane, which is again equivalent to its type IIB\nT-dual.\nOnce new type IIA configurations have been generated, they can also\nbe understood as the Kaluza\u2013Klein reductions of certain new M-theory\nconfigurations. In particular, the F(4, 1)as-brane and the F(3, 2)-brane\nare the reductions of the F(4, 2)-brane\nF(4) = F \u2227 dvol(E2 )\nds211 = \u039b1/3 [ds2 (E4,1 ) + h] + \u039b\u22122/3 ds2 (E2 ) ,\n\n(64)\n\nwhereas the F(1, 4)-brane and the F(0, 5)as -brane come from the\nF(1, 5)-brane\n\u22c6F(4) = F \u2227 dvol(E5 )\nds211 = \u039b2/3 [\u2212ds2 (E1,1 ) + h] + \u039b\u22121/3 ds2 (E5 ) .\nThis is illustrated in Figure 1.\n\n(65)\n\n\fF(3,2)\nF(4,1)as\nF(4,1)bs\n\nF5\n\nF(4,1)\n\nIIB vacuum\nIIA vacuum\n\nF(4,2)\n\nF(2,3)\n\nF(1,4)\n\nF(0,5)\n\nF(0,5)bs\n\nF(1,5)\n\nF(0,5)as\n\nFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\nM vacuum\n\n20\n\nFigure 1.

F3-brane dualities. The starting point is the F3-brane, with\nmetric (37) and RR 1-form potential (36), whereas the dilaton is given\nby \u03c6 = 43 log \u039b, \u039b being the one defined in (35).\nProceeding as in the previous subsection, one can generate a family\nof F(p, 3 \u2212 p)-brane configurations by performing T-duality transformations along 3 \u2212 p of the the worldspace directions of the original\nF3-brane. They belong to type IIA for odd p and to type IIB for even\np. They are jointly described by\np\n\u03c6 = log \u039b ,\nG(5\u2212p) = F \u2227 dvol(E3\u2212p )\n4\n(66)\ng = \u039b1/2 ds2 (Ep,1 ) + \u039b\u22121/2 ds2 (E3\u2212p ) + h ,\nwhere the transverse metric h is defined by\n\u0001\n\u0002\nh = \u039b1/2 dr2 + r2 d\u03b812 + sin2 \u03b81 d\u03b822\n\n+r2 cos2 \u03b81 d\u03c621 + sin2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82 d\u03c622 + sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c623\n\n\u0001\u0003\n\n\u2212 \u039b\u22121/2 r4 \u03b22 cos2 \u03b81 d\u03c61 + \u03b23 sin2 \u03b81 cos2 \u03b82 d\u03c62 + \u03b24 sin2 \u03b81 sin2 \u03b82 d\u03c63\n\n\u00012\n\n. (67)\n\nNotice that the F(0, 3)-brane is S-selfdual-in particular, it has a\nconstant dilaton-whereas the F(2, 1)-brane is S-dual to the F(2, 1)bsbrane described by\n\u03c6 = \u2212 21 log \u039b ,\n\nH = \u2212F \u2227 dx\n\ng = ds2 (E2,1 ) + \u039b\u22121 dx2 + \u039b\u22121/2 h .\n\n(68)\n\nUsing T-duality along the longitudinal E2 subspace, one generates the\nsame solution in type IIA, namely the F(2, 1)as-brane. Both are the\nT-duals of the corresponding IIA/B vacuum when applying a T-duality\ntransformation along the twisted direction.\nFinally, both the F(1, 2)-brane and the F(2, 1)as-brane can be understood as the Kaluza\u2013Klein reduction of the F(2, 2)-brane in eleven\ndimensions\nF(4) = F \u2227 dvol(E2 )\nds2(11) = \u039b1/3 ds2 (E2,1 ) + \u039b\u22122/3 ds2 (E2 ) + \u039b\u22121/6 h .\n\n(69)\n\nThis finishes the web of dualities for the F3-brane, which is summarised\nin Figure 2.\n4.4. F1-string dualities. Due to the fact that there exist two inequivalent fluxstring configurations preserving different amount of supersymmetry, we shall introduce some notation that will allow us to\ndiscuss their U-duality properties in a joint discussion. In particular,\nwe shall introduce an index i = 1, 2 such that all quantities indexed by\ni = 1 will correspond to the fluxstring preserving 1/4 supersymmetry,\nwhereas those indexed by i = 2 will describe the 1/8 configuration.\n\n\fFIGUEROA-O'FARRILL AND SIM\u00d3N\n\nF(2,1)\n\nF(2,1)bs\nF3\n\nM vacuum\n\nIIA vacuum\n\nF(2,1)as\n\nIIB vacuum\n\nF(2,2)\n\nF(1,2)\n\nF(0,3)\n\n22\n\nFigure 2.

The N(4,3)-brane is S-selfdual (hence it has constant\ndilaton) whereas the N(6,1)-brane is S-dual to the N(6, 1)bs-brane\n\u03c6 = \u2212 21 log \u039b\n\nand\n\nH = \u2212F \u2227 dx7 ,\n\n(79)\n\nwith metric\ng = ds2 (E6 ) + \u039b\u22121 d(y 7)2 + \u039b\u22121/2 h .\n\n(80)\n\nSimilarly, the N(2,5)-brane is S-dual to the N(2, 5)bs-brane\n\u03c6 = 21 log \u039b\n\nH = 2dx\u2212 \u2227 dvol(E2 ) ,\n\nand\n\n(81)\n\nwith metric\ng = \u039bds2 (E2 ) + ds2 (E5 ) + \u039b1/2 h ,\n\n(82)\n\nwhereas the N(0,7)-brane is S-dual to the N(0, 7)bs-brane\n\u03c6 = log \u039b\n\nand\n\nF(1) = 2dx\u2212 ,\n\n(83)\n\nwith metric\ng = \u039b1/2 ds2 (E7 ) + \u039bh .\n\n(84)\n\nOne can proceed systematically, uplifting the new type IIA configurations obtained on the process to get new M-theory configurations\nsuch as the N(6,2)-brane described by\nF(4) = F \u2227 dvol(E2 ) ,\n\n(85)\n\ng = \u039b1/3 ds2 (E6 ) + \u039b\u22122/3 ds2 (E2 ) + \u039b\u22121/6 h .\n\n(86)\n\nand metric\nThere are many more configurations that go beyond the scope of our\npresent analysis, but deserve further study since, among many other\ninterests, they might lead to more general ans\u00e4tze to solve the elevenand ten-dimensional supergravity equations of motion.\nAcknowledgements\nMuch of this work was done while the authors were participating\nin the programme Mathematical Aspects of String Theory at the Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Institute in Vienna, whom we would like to thank for\nsupport and for providing such a stimulating environment in which to\ndo research.
