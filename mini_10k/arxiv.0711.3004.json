A perfect device would just produce x\u0304 with a single measurement. In practice, such a device does not exist. A realistic device produce a value x in\nthe interval [x, x + dx] with probability P (x) dx, where the probability distribution P (x)\ncharacterises the apparatus. We will not assume that our experimental device is hampered\nby systematic errors, but we will assume that the device produces the exact value x\u0304 by an\n\n2\n\n\faverage over many measurements, i.e.,\nZ\ndx x P (x) = x\u0304 ,\n\n(1)\n\nbut, depending on P (x), a single measurement can be far from the true value.\nAs an example, we consider an observable x\u0304 = 3 and a crude experiment which can produce\nany value for between 0 and 6 with equal probability:\n\u001a\n1/6 for x \u2208 [0, 6]\n(2)\nP (x) =\n0\notherwise.\nObviously, a single measurement for x is not sufficient to reveal the true observable. The\nonly thing we can do is to repeat the measurement n times and to consider the average:\ni\n1h\nx1 + . . . + xn ,\ny =\nn\n\nwhere x1 to xn are the values obtained from each of the measurements. For the moment,\nwe will assume that the measurements are independent, i.e., that the probability for finding\na set {x1 . . . xn } of data is given by:\nP (x1 , . . . , xn ) = P (x1 ) . . . P (xn ) .\nThe crucial question is to which accuracy have we estimated the true observable x\u0304?\nThe answer can be inferred from the probability distribution Q(y) for the value y:\nQn (y) =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n1\ndxi \u03b4 y \u2212\n[x1 + . . . + xn ] P (x1 ) . . . P (xn ) .\nn\ni=1\n\nZ Y\nn\n\n(3)\n\nGiven the proper normalisation of the single event distributions, i.e.,\nZ\ndxi P (xi ) = 1 ,\nusing (1), we can easily show that the average of y coincides with the observable:\nZ\n\u0233 =\ndy y Qn (y)\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\nZ Y\nn\n1\n1\n=\ndy\n[x1 + . . . + xn ] P (x1 ) . . .

P (xn ) =\nn\ndx x P (x) = x\u0304 .\nn\nn\ni=1\n3\n\n\fA natural measure for the error \u03c3 of our estimate is provided by the second moment:\nZ\n\u0010\n\u00112\n2\n\u03c3 (n) =\ndy y \u2212 \u0233 Qn (y) ,\n(the variance) .\n(4)\nIf the distribution Qn (y) peaks around the true value for our observable x\u0304 and \u03c3(n) is tiny,\nit would mean that a single estimator y has high probability to fall close to x\u0304 with high\nprobability implying that it yields a good approximation to x\u0304.\nLet us study the moments of the distribution Q(y):\nZ\nqm =\ndy Qn (y) y m .\n\n(5)\n\nIn order to draw further conclusions, we need to restrict the classes of single event probability distributions P (x): we will assume that its Fourier transform\nZ\nP\u0304 (\u03b2) =\ndx P (x) exp {\u2212i \u03b2 x}\n(6)\nis an analytic function of \u03b2 at \u03b2 = 0. As a consequence, the moments of P (x) exist and\nare given by:\nZ\ndm\nP\u0304 (\u03b2) |\u03b2=0 .\n(7)\npm =\ndx P (x) xm = im\nd\u03b2 m\nWe will further assume that P\u0304 (\u03b2) vanishes for |\u03b2| \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. This seems to be quite a weak\nconstraint. I point out, however, that systems with rare but large fluctuations generically\nfail to possess higher moments. One example is stock market indices [1].\n\nOur aim is to express the moments of Qn (y) in terms of the moments of P (x). For this\npurpose, we rewrite the \u03b4-function in (3) as\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\nZ\nn\nn \u03b1 o\nY\n1\nd\u03b1\n\u03b4 y \u2212\n[x1 + . . . + xn ] =\nexp[i \u03b1 y]\nexp \u2212i xi ,\nn\n2\u03c0\nn\ni=1\n\n(8)\n\nand find\n\u0014Z\nn \u03b1 o\u0015n\nd\u03b1\nexp(i \u03b1 y)\ndx P (x) exp \u2212i x\n,\nQn (y) =\n2\u03c0\nn\nZ\nh \u0010 \u03b1 \u0011 in\nd\u03b1\n=\nexp(i \u03b1 y) P\u0304\n.\n2\u03c0\nn\nZ\n\nThe moments of Qn (y) are then obtained from\nZ\nZ\ni\n\u0010 \u0011\nm h\nd\u03b1\nm d\nn \u03b1\n.\nexp(i \u03b1 y) P\u0304\n(\u2212i)\nqm =\ndy\n2\u03c0\nd\u03b1m\nn\n4\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n\fAfter a series of partial integrations with respect to \u03b1 (note that boundary terms vanish\nby virtue of our above assumptions), the latter equation is given by\nZ\nZ\ndm h n \u0010 \u03b1 \u0011i\nd\u03b1\nexp(i \u03b1 y) (i)m\nP\u0304\nqm =\ndy\n2\u03c0\nd\u03b1m\nn\nZ\nZ\ni\ni\nm h\nd\u03b1 1\nim dm h n\nm d\nn\n=\ndy exp(i \u03b1 y) (i)\nP\u0304 (\u03b2) = m m P\u0304 (\u03b2) |\u03b2=0 .

Introducing the cumulants ck [P ] of the single event\ndistribution as well, i.e.,\nh\ni(k)\nck [P ] = ik ln P\u0304 (0)\n,\n(16)\n\nwe arrive at a very important result:\n\n1\n\nck [Qn ] =\n\nnk\u22121\n\nck [P ] .\n\n(17)\n\nNote that the cumulants ck [P ] are finite numbers which characterise the single event probability distribution. Equation (17) then implies that for increasing number of measurements\nn, the higher (k > 1) cumulants of Qn (y) vanish.

This finding is called the central limit\ntheorem: if the moments of probability distribution P (x) exist, the probability distribution\nfor the average y can be approximated by a Gaussian for sufficiently large n given that the\nstandard deviation \u03c3 is properly scaled with n.\nLet us discuss this result. Figure 1 shows the distributions Qn (y) for n = 1, 2, 3 and n = 10.\nAlready for n = 10 the distribution is well approximated by the Gaussian.\n\nThe existence of at least the moment c2 [P ] of the single event distribution is crucial for\nthe error reduction by repeated measurements.

This actually implies that it impossible to experimentally gain a\nreliable value for the observable x\u0304.\n\n1.2\n\nError analysis\n\nLet us return to the example in (2), and let us assume a group of experimentalists has\nperformed n = 12 measurements with the result:\n7\n\n\f2.813\n5.394\n0.325\n\n2.021\n5.937\n2.750\n\n0.331\n5.027\n1.283\n\n0.865\n1.556\n3.890\n\nThe average over these values and an estimate hx2 i of c2 [P ] are given by\nn\n\ny =\n\nn\n\n1X\nxk \u2248 2.683 ,\nn k=1\n\nhx2 i =\n\n1X 2\nx \u2248 3.581 .\nn k=1 k\n\n(24)\n\nWe point out that 3.581 is a poor estimate of the true value (19) of c2 [P ] = 3, but it gives\nthe order of magnitude. With this estimate for c2 [P ], we find for the error (18)\nr\n3.581\n\u03c3(n = 12) \u2248\n\u2248 0.546 .\n12\nHence, the final 'experimental' result for the observable would be\nx\u0304 \u2248 2.683 \u00b1 0.546 = 2.7(5) .\n\n(25)\n\nNote that the true result x\u0304 = 3 lies well with the reach of the error bars.\nThe above experiment was repeated by several research labs. Depending on the budget\nand the focus of research, different labs produce different numbers n of measurements:\n\nn\ny\n\nCERN\nGSI\nDESY\nBNL\n120\n50\n78\n150\n3.112 \u00b1 0.163 2.764 \u00b1 0.255 3.110 \u00b1 0.207 3.083 \u00b1 0.143\n\nThe smallest error was produced by the largest experiment (BNL). We could just quote\ntheir result, but it would be a pity to disregard a total of 248 measurements which were\ncarried out by the other groups. How can we obtain a 'world average'for the observable x\u0304\nand how can we quantify its (statistical) error?\nTo answer these questions, we assume that the number n of each measurement was large\nenough to approximate the distribution of an individual result yk , k = 1 . . . N (where\nN = 4 for the above example) by a Gaussian (21):\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n(yl \u2212 x\u0304)2\nQ(yl ) \u2248 \u221a\nexp \u2212\n.\n(26)\n2\u03c3l2\n2\u03c0 \u03c3l\nFor the world average y we make the ansatz\ny =\n\nN\nX\n\nN\nX\n\nal yl ,\n\nl=1\n\nl=1\n\n8\n\nal = 1 .\n\n(27)\n\n\fThe weights al must be chosen in an optimal way. This choice will depend on the errors \u03c3l\nof the individual experiments. In particular, the experiment with the smallest error should\ncontribute to the world average with the largest weight. Assuming that the experiments at\nthe different labs were carried out independently, the probability distribution of the world\naverage is now given by\nZ Y\nN\nN\n\u0010\n\u0011\nX\nW (y) =\ndyk \u03b4 y \u2212\nal yl Q(y1 ) . . .

Here,\nwe must take into account the normalisation condition in (27). We therefore minimise\ni\nXh\na2l \u03c3l2 \u2212 \u03bb al \u2212\u2192 min ,\n(30)\nl\n\nwhere \u03bb is a Lagrange multiplier.

We find\n\u03c3 \u2248 0.089 ,\na1 \u2248 0.30 ,\n\n(34)\na2 \u2248 0.12 ,\n\na3 \u2248 0.19 ,\n\na3 \u2248 0.39 .\n\nWith the weights at our disposal, we easily find the optimal value for the world average\ny \u2248 3.059. Together with the error in (34), the final result is\nx\u0304 = 3.059 \u00b1 0.089 = 3.06(9) .\n\n(35)\n\nNote that the true result x\u0304 = 3 is again covered within error bars and that the error became\nsignificantly smaller than that of the best result provided by the BNL group.\n9\n\n\f1.3\n\nAutocorrelations\n\nIn the previous subsections, we have repeatedly assumed that the measurements xi are\nindependent. We will see below that a vital tool of computational quantum field theory is\nto use information from the measurement xi to obtain the value for xi+1 . In this case, the\ndata set xi , i = 1 . . . n is generated by the chain\nx1 \u2192 x2 \u2192 . . . \u2192 xn\u22121 \u2192 xn ,\nand the probability of finding a particular set does not factorise anymore:\nP (x1 , . . . , xn ) 6= P (x1 ) . . . P (xn ) .\nIn the context of QFT simulations we will, however, make an effort to render the values\nxi as independent as possible. This generically implies that events which are separated by\nsome 'time'\u03c4 , i.e., the events xi and xi+\u03c4 , can be considered as statistically independent.\nThe trick for obtaining an idea of the error of the estimator is to group b measurements\ntogether:\nb\nn\n1 X\nx\u03bd+i ,\n\u03bd = 1 ...

The quantities of\ninterest are the average\nM\n1 X\n\u0233 =\ny\u03bd ,\n(38)\nM \u03bd=1\nwhich converges to the observable x\u0304 in the limit M \u2192 \u221e, and the corresponding error\n\u03c32 =\n\n1\nb\nc2 [Py ] =\nc2 [Py ] .\nM\nn\n\n(39)\n\nwhere the cumulant c2 [Py ] is given by\nc2 [Py ] =\nwith\nhf i =\n\n*\n\nM\n1 X 2\ny\nM \u03bd=1 \u03bd\n\nZ Y\nn\n\n+\n\n\u2212\n\n\"*\n\nM\n1 X\ny\u03bd\nM \u03bd=1\n\n+ #2\n\ndxl f (x1 . . . xn ) P (x1 , . . . , xn ) .\n\nl=1\n\nAssuming translational invariance, i.e.,\nhx\u03bd+i x\u03bd+k i = hxi xk i ,\n10\n\n,\n\n(40)\n\n\fwe find\nc2 [Py ] =\n\nb\nb\n1 XX\nc(k \u2212 i) ,\nb2 i=1 k=1\n\nc(k \u2212 i) = hxi xk i \u2212 hxi ihxk i ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhere c(k \u2212 i) is called the autocorrelation function. Introducing the relative distance\nt = k \u2212 i, and trading the summation over k in (41) for a summation over t, we find\nb\nb\u2212i\n1 X X\nc2 [Py ] = 2\nc(t) .\nb i=1 t=1\u2212i\n\n(42)\n\nInterchanging the summation indices t and i and after summing over i, this last equation\nbecomes:\nb\u22121\n2 X\n1\n(b \u2212 t) c(t) .\nc2 [Py ] = c(0) + 2\nb\nb t=1\n\nWe have already mentioned that the measurements xi and xi+\u03c4 are (almost) uncorrelated.\nThe equivalent statement is that the correlation function vanishes for sufficiently large\narguments:\nc(t) \u2248 0 ,\nfor t > \u03c4 .\nFor b \u226b \u03c4 , we approximately find:\nc2 [Py ] \u2248\n\nb\u22121\nb\u22121\n1 X\n2 X\n1\nc(t) .\nb c(t) =\nc(0) + 2\nb\nb t=1\nb t=1\u2212b\n\n(43)\n\nIt is convenient to introduce the normalised autocorrelation function by\n\u03c1(t) =\n\nc(t)\n,\nc(0)\n\nc(0) = hx2 i \u2212 hxi2 = c2 [Px ] .\n\n(44)\n\nThe integrated autocorrelation time is then defined by\nb\u22121\nb\u22121\nX\n1 X\n1\n\u03c4 =\n\u03c1(t) =\n+\n\u03c1(t) .\n2 t=1\u2212b\n2\nt=1\n\n(45)\n\nInserting (45,44,43) into (39), we finally obtain for the error which should be attributed to\nour estimate \u0233 in (38):\n2\u03c4\nc2 [Px ] .\n(46)\n\u03c32 =\nn\nLet us perform a consistency check by considering the special case that the measurements\nare uncorrelated. In this case, the autocorrelation function \u03c1(t) vanishes for t \u2265 1, and the\nautocorrelation time is given by \u03c4 = 1/2. We indeed recover the familiar result\n\u03c32 =\n\n1\nc2 [Px ] ,\nn\n\nfor independent measurements.\n11\n\n(47)\n\n\fNote that autocorrelations increase the error bars. Not knowing the autocorrelations in a\nnumerical simulations leads us to the erroneous assumption that the error of the estimator is\ngiven by (47), while the true result is by a factor \u03c4 larger. Not knowing the autocorrelations\nalways leads to an underestimation of the statistical error.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nLessons from the Ising model\nPhase transitions\n\nA phase transition occurs if the properties of matter change qualitatively when an external\nparameter, such as temperature, is altered. The phase transition of water from a liquid\nto a gas phase when the temperature exceeds roughly \u2248 1000 Celsius (under normal\nconditions), is well known from everyday life. A second example is the ferromagnet: the\ninteraction between microscopic spins favour a unique orientation of the spins. This yields\nan ordered phase at low temperatures. Above the critical temperature, called the Curie\ntemperature in the present context, the spins are organised in a disordered phase.\nLet us assume that a ferromagnet is in the disordered phase at a temperature slightly\nbigger than the critical temperature Tc . If we decrease the temperature, the information\nof the unique orientation spreads over the spin lattice. This 'Gedankenexperiment 'shows\nthat the spatial correlation of the spins becomes large at the critical temperature. This\nphenomenon, is quantified with the help of the spin-spin correlation function:\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u001a\n\u001b\n|x \u2212 y|\n\u03c3(x) \u03c3(y) \u221d exp \u2212\n.\n(48)\n\u03be\nThe correlation length \u03be obviously measures the spatial distance over which the spins show\n> T , \u03be becomes\nroughly the same orientation. Close to the phase transition, i.e. for T \u223c\nc\nlarge anticipating the ordered phase:\n\u03be \u2248 \u03be+\n\nT\n1\u2212\nTc\n\n\u2212\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(T\n\n>\n\u223c\n\nTc ) ,\n\n(49)\n\nwhere \u03bd is a positive number. The divergence of the correlation length at the phase\ntransition is characteristic for a transition of 2nd (or higher) order. In the case of a 1st\norder transition, the increase of \u03be is hindered by the nucleation of bubbles which contain\nchunks of the new state of matter. These bubbles provide additional disorder and the\ncorrelation length stays finite.\nFor phase transitions above first order, the singularity of the correlation length has its\nfingerprint in many other thermodynamical quantities such as the specific heat C or the\nmagnetic susceptibility \u03c7:\nC \u2248 C0\n\nT\n1\u2212\nTc\n\n\u2212\u03b1\n\n,\n\n\u03c7 \u2248 \u03c70\n12\n\nT\n1\u2212\nTc\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n\n,\n\n(T\n\n>\n\u223c\n\nTc ) .\n\n\fThe critical exponents \u03bd, \u03b1, \u03b3 are independent of the microscopic properties of the spin\nmodel (such as the lattice geometry), and only depend on the symmetries (present at the\ntransition) and the number of dimensions. They are often used to sort solid state physics\nmodels into the so-called universality classes.\n\n2.2\n\nQuantum field theory rising\n\nLet the lattice spacing a denote the distance between two neighbouring lattice sites . In the\nprevious subsection, we found that the correlation length diverges if the coupling constant\n\u03b2 (or inverse temperature in the present context, \u03b2 = 1/T ) approaches its critical value\n(see (49)). This statement can be phrased in units of the lattice spacing as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212\u03bd\n\u03be\n= \u03ba \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2\n,\na\n\n\u03b2\n\n<\n\u223c\n\n\u03b2c ,\n\n(50)\n\nwhere \u03ba is a dimensionless constant which can be obtained by numerical means.\nLet us now reinterpret these findings. Rather than saying that \u03be diverges and a is fixed, we\nsay that the correlation length \u03be is fixed and is given by an observable in physical units. We\nwill see that this interpretation of the same data defines a quantum field theory. For\nfixed correlation length \u03be, (50) defines the lattice spacing as a function of \u03b2, i.e., a \u2192 a(\u03b2),\na(\u03b2) =\n\n1\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2c )\u03bd \u03be ,\n\u03ba\n\n\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b2c .\n\n(51)\n\nThe key point is if we make the number of spins bigger and bigger and, at the same time,\nthe distance a between the spins smaller and smaller, we will obtain a field theory in the\nlimit a \u2192 0. For the 2d Ising model on a cubic lattice, we have \u03b2c \u2248 0.44 and \u03bd = 1. The\nfield theory limit is then approached when a vanishes linearly with \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2c :\na(\u03b2) =\n\n\u03be\n(\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2c ) ,\n\u03ba\n\n(2d Ising model).\n\nNote that the dimensionless parameter \u03b2 is not at our disposal anymore, since it specifies\nthe magnitude of the lattice spacing. Instead, the value of \u03be parameterises the emerging\nquantum field theory. The exchange of a dimensionless parameter for a scale dependent one\nin a quantum field theory is known as dimensional transmutation. It is a generic feature\nof quantum field theories. For instance in the case of perturbative QCD, the dimensionless\ngauge coupling g is eliminated in favour of the scale dependent parameter \u039bQCD .\nLet us assume that a certain correlation function was obtained by a numerical simulation\nof a classical lattice model for large values |x \u2212 y|,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001c\n\u001d\n\u001a\n\u001b\nD |x \u2212 y| = F (\u03c6(x)) F (\u03c6(y)) \u221d exp \u2212m |x \u2212 y| ,\n(52)\n13\n\n\f|z\u2212x| = 2 2 a\n\na\nz\n\nx\n\n|y\u2212x| = 3 a\n\ny\n\nFigure 2: Spin correlation along the diagonal and the symmetry axis, respectively.\nwhere m is called the screening mass. Since the distance |x \u2212 y| is only known in units\nof the lattice spacing by construction, the simulation will provide the mass in units of\nthe lattice spacing as a function of \u03b2, i.e. ma (\u03b2). If universality holds, one finds the\ncharacteristic scaling of the lattice model, i.e.,\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03bd\n< \u03b2 .\nm a(\u03b2) = \u03bam \u03b2c \u2212 \u03b2\n,\n\u03b2\u223c\n(53)\nc\nUsing (50), we see that the product m \u03be approaches a constant in the vicinity of the critical\nlimit:\n\u03be\n(54)\nm \u03be = m a = \u03bam \u03ba .\na\nNote that \u03ba and \u03bam are two c-numbers which we obtain from the numerical simulations.\nWith the help of these two numbers we can \"measure\" the desired mass m in units of 1/\u03be,\nwhere \u03be is the only free parameter of our theory.\nIn the case of a quantum field theory, we expect that due to the isotropy of the vacuum\nthe correlation function (52) only depends on the distance between x and y. In the classical lattice model, continuous rotational symmetry is violated due to the presence of the\ncubic lattice, and it might happen that the quantum field theory which emerges from the\nlattice model inherits the anisotropy. This anisotropy can be measured by comparing the\ncorrelation length in lattice units along a lattice symmetry axis, \u03be, and a long the diagonal\ndirection, \u03bed (see figure 2). As far as global symmetries are concerned, the symmetry under\nconsideration is restored in the critical limit (51):\nfor a \u2192 0 .\n\n\u03bed = \u03be ,\n\nFurther details on the restoration of rotational symmetry in the context of the 2-dimensional\nIsing model can be found in [2].\n\n14\n\n\f2.3\n\nMean-field approximation\n\nThe starting point for a thermodynamical description of the Ising model is the partition\nfunction:\nX\nZ=\nexp (\u2212\u03b2 H(\u03c3))\n(55)\n{\u03c3x }\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T and where a spin \u03c3x = \u00b11 is associated which each site x of the square\nlattice. The sum in (55) extends over all possible spin configurations. The ferromagnetic\ninteraction favours a unique orientation of the spins, and is described by\nX\nH(\u03c3) = \u2212\n\u03c3x \u03c3y ,\n(56)\n<xy>\n\nwhere the sum extends over all pairs < xy > of nearest neighbours. In order to preserve\ntranslational invariance, periodic boundary conditions are often used in particle physics\napplications, although these conditions are difficult to interpret in the solid state physics\ncontext.\nIn order to gain an initial insight into the phase structure of the Ising model, we choose a\nparticular spin \u03c3x0 of the lattice, and assume heuristically that that we might replace the\nneighbouring spins by the mean\n1 X\n\u03c3x0 exp (\u2212\u03b2 H(\u03c3)) .\n(57)\nh\u03c3i =\nZ\n{\u03c3x }\n\nThe Hamiltonian is then approximately given by\nH(\u03c3x0 ) \u2248 const. \u2212 4h\u03c3i \u03c3x0 .\n\n(58)\n\nNote that each spin possesses 4 neighbours on a cubic 2d square lattice. Equation (57)\nturns into a self-consistency equation to determine the h\u03c3i, which can be interpreted as\nthe magnetisation per site:\n1 X\n\u03c3x exp (\u2212\u03b2 H(\u03c3)) ,\n(59)\nh\u03c3i =\nN \u03c3 =\u00b11 0\nx0\nX\nexp (\u2212\u03b2 H(\u03c3)) .\n(60)\nN =\n\u03c3x0 =\u00b11\n\nPerforming the sum over \u03c3x0 leaves us with a non-linear equation:\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\u03c3i = tanh 4 \u03b2 h\u03c3i .\n\n(61)\n\nBefore we proceed with a numerical solution of this equation, we point out that (61) always\npossesses the trivial solution\nh\u03c3i = 0 .\n15\n\n\f1\nmean field\nexact\n\n<\u03c3>\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nFigure 3: Magnetisation per site as function of the inverse temperature \u03b2; solid line: mean\nfield approximation; dashed line: exact\nA graphical inspection of (61) easily shows that for\n\u03b2 >\n\n1\n,\n4\n\n(62)\n\ntwo non-trivial solutions \u00b1c, for c > 0 exist.

The mean field\napproximation is able to describe the transition from the disordered to the ordered phase.\nHowever, the mean field approximation fails at a quantitative level. The correct value for\nthe critical value, which was already obtained by Kramers and Wannier in 1941 [3], is given\nby\n\u03b2c = 0.44068679 . . .\n(65)\nis significantly underestimated. Also the rise of the magnetisation close to \u03b2c is not correctly\nreproduced. A Taylor expansion of (61) with respect to \u03b2 around \u03b2cMF = 1/4 (and therefore\nalso with respect to \u03c3), yields:\n\u0011b\n\u221a \u0010\n1\n(66)\nh\u03c3i \u2248 12 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2c ,\nb= .\n2\nThe mean field critical exponent of 1/2 is much too large compared with the exact exponent\nof bexact = 1/8.\n\nThe advantage of the mean-field approximation is that it can be easily applied to a variety\nof models (e.g. the Ising model in d > 2 where no exact results are available). It often\nprovides a correct first impression of the phase structure. The disadvantage is that it is\ndifficult to improve the approximation in a systematic way.\n\n2.4\n\nDuality transformation\n\nLet us list different geometrical objects on a lattice. The sites on a lattice are labelled by\ninteger coordinates. Links are short line segments which join two neighbouring sites on\nthe lattice. In order to unambiguously address a link on the lattice, we use coordinates\nwhich are integers with the exception of one coordinate which is half integer, such as 2.5\n(see figure 4 for an illustration). Another important object is the so-called plaquette ,\n17\n\n\fwhich is an elementary square of the cubic lattice. Two coordinates are half integer when\na plaquette is addressed. In higher dimensions, there are also cubes, and their coordinates\nare half integer, while the other coordinates are integer.\nThe dual lattice is an important object which helps to gain non-perturbative information\nfor certain lattice models. The coordinates of the dual lattice are obtained by adding 0.5\nto all coordinates of the lattice. If we consider a d dimensional lattice model, the duality\ntransformation maps an x-dimensional geometrical object into a d \u2212 x dimensional object\non the dual lattice. Let us consider 2 dimensions. A site, such as (2, 4) is mapped into\n(2.5, 4.5), which are the coordinates of a plaquette, while a link, e.g. (1.5, 5), maps into\nanother link namely (2, 5.5).\nWith these prerequisites, let us consider the probabilistic measure of the 2d Ising model.\nSince the product \u03c3x \u03c3y can only be \u00b11, we expand:\nn\no\nexp \u03b2 \u03c3x \u03c3y = a + b \u03c3x \u03c3y .\n\nInserting both possible values for the product \u03c3x \u03c3y , we find:\na + b = e\u03b2 ,\nand finally:\n\nn\n\nexp \u03b2 \u03c3x \u03c3y\n\no\n\na \u2212 b = e\u2212\u03b2 ,\n\n= cosh \u03b2 + sinh \u03b2 \u03c3x \u03c3y .\n\n(67)\n\nHence, the partition function in (55) can be written as\ni\nX\nYh\n2N\nZ=\ncosh\n1 + tanh \u03b2 \u03c3x \u03c3y .\n\n(68)\n\n{\u03c3x }\n\nhxyi\n\nwhere x and y are nearest neighbours on the lattice, and the corresponding link is denoted\nby hxyi. Note also that, in 2 dimensions, there are 2N links for a lattice with N sites.\nIn order to perform the sum over all spin configurations in (68), we use the important\nrelations:\nX\nX\n\u03c3 = 0,\n\u03c32 = 2 .\n\u03c3=\u00b11\n\n\u03c3=\u00b11\n\nHence, if we perform the sum over the spin \u03c3x in (68), we must make sure that it appears\ntwice (or an even number of times) when we expand the products of the square brackets.\nThus, if we avoid a vanishing contribution to the partition function, integration over the\nspins generates closed loops the corners of which are marked by a pair of spins. For each\nlink of the closed loop, we get a factor tanh \u03b2. Hence, after we have integrated out all\nspins, the partition function can be written as:\niN (L)\nXh\ntanh \u03b2\n,\n(69)\nZ = cosh2N \u03b2 2N\nloops\n\n18\n\n\fspins\nappear\ntwice\nclosed\nloop\n\n3\n2\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 5: Integration over spins generate closed loops.\nwhere N(L) is the number of links of the closed loop L. Note that we obtained a factor of\n2 for each sum over a particular spin \u03c3. This gives rise to the prefactor 2N in front of the\nsum in (69). We now have converted the Ising model into a string theory, but we have not\ngained much information on the Ising model so far. To proceed further, we must control\nthe sum over closed loops. For this purpose, we introduce new variables \u03c4 = \u00b11 which are\nassociated with the plaquettes (see figure 6). If we consider two neighbouring plaquettes,\nthere is always just one link between them. Now we say that if the product of the two\nneighbouring plaquettes is \u22121, the corresponding link is part of the loop. If the product\nis 1, the link is not part of the loop. The advantage of the \u03c4 variables is that we can\nrandomly assign \u00b11 to them and all loops which we produce are closed. Hence, summing\nover all possible \u03c4 configurations will do the sum over all possible closed loops for us.\nNote that each plaquette of the lattice is mapped to a site on the dual lattice. The link\nbetween two neighbouring plaquettes is mapped into the link between the adjacent sites\nof the dual lattice. Finally, we must express N(L) in terms of the \u03c4 variables. For this\npurpose, we have to count all activated links (links which are part of a loop) on the lattice.\nIt is easy to check that\ni\nX 1h\n(70)\n1 \u2212 \u03c4xd \u03c4yd\nN(L) =\n2\nhxd yd i\n\ncounts these links: if two neighbouring \u03c4 s are equal, they do not contribute to N(L), and\nis they are different, they contribute 1 as they should. Using the \u03c4 -representation of the\nclosed loops, the partition function (69) becomes\nZ = [cosh \u03b2]2N [2 tanh \u03b2]N\n\ni\u2212 21 \u03c4xd \u03c4yd\nX Y h\ntanh \u03b2\n.\n\n{\u03c4xd } hxd yd i\n\n19\n\n(71)\n\n\f\u03c4=1\n\n3\n2\n\n\u03c4 = \u22121\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFigure 6: Introducing dual variables to represent closed loops.\nThis last equation can be written as\nZ = sinhN (2\u03b2)\n\nX\n\n{\u03c4xd }\n\n1\n\u03b2e = \u2212 ln tanh \u03b2 .\n2\n\nexp\n\nnX\n\nhxd yd i\n\n\u03b2e \u03c4xd \u03c4yd\n\no\n\n.\n\n(72)\n(73)\n\nWe have obtained again a 2d Ising model which is now formulated on the dual lattice: the\nonly difference is that the coupling is now \u03b2e rather than \u03b2. It is not generally true that\nthe duality transform yields the same lattice model just with different couplings. Models\nwhich do have this property are called self dual.\nNow let us assume that \u03b2 is large (small temperature). In this case, we find from (73) that\n\u03b2e \u2248 e\u22122\u03b2 ,\n\n\u03b2 large.\n\nBy contrast, if \u03b2 is small (the high temperature limit), we find\n1\n\u03b2e \u2248 \u2212 ln \u03b2 ,\n2\n\n\u03b2 small.\n\nHence, large \u03b2 corresponds to small \u03b2e and vice versa (see figure 7). This is interesting since\nthe so-called strong coupling expansion techniques are available for small \u03b2. Performing\nthe expansion with respect to \u03b2e in the dual model, the large \u03b2 regime can also be studied\nby analytic methods. The basis of this expansion is a Taylor expansion of the exponential\nwith respect to \u03b2. This expansion naturally reaches its radius of convergence when \u03b2\n20\n\n\f128x128, 2D Ising, Wolff cluster alg.\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nMagnetisation\n\n1\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u223c\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n0.2\n\n1\n\n128x128 lattice\nmean field\ninfinite volume\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b2\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 7: The dual coupling constant \u03b2e as a function of \u03b2 (left).

Performing the expansion using the dual model, the\nTaylor expansion with respect to \u03b2e also breaks down at the critical coupling. There are no\nother couplings for which singularities in thermodynamical quantities occur. Hence, the\ncritical point is obtained if\n\u03b2 = \u03b2e = \u03b2c .\n(74)\n\nUsing (73), we therefore find\n\u03b2c = \u2212\n\n1\nln tanh \u03b2c ,\n2\n\n\u03b2c =\n\n\u221a\n1\nln(1 + 2) \u2248 0.44068679 . . . .\n2\n\n(75)\n\nFigure 7 also shows the magnetisation as a function of \u03b2 for a 128 \u00d7 128 lattice compared\nwith the mean field result and the exact result in the infinite volume limit.\nThere are lot of interesting features of field theories already present in the Ising model:\nthere is the relation between a lattice model and a theory of strings, and there is the duality\ntransform which maps the high temperature theory onto a low temperature theory.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMarkov chain Monte-Carlo: the Ising case study\nFoundations\n\nThe idea central to all simulations of lattice models is to generate lattice configurations\n{\u03c3x } according to their probabilistic measure\nP (\u03c3) = exp (\u2212\u03b2 H(\u03c3)) /Z\n21\n\n(76)\n\n\fwhere Z is the partition function (55). A straightforward idea to accomplish this task would\nbe to generate randomly the spins at each site x and to accept or reject this configuration\naccording to (76). The problem is that we would hardly find any acceptable configurations.\nWhy is this so?\nLet us answer this question in the context of the Ising model of the previous section. The\ntwo dimensional lattice consists of N = 125 \u00d7 125 sites. Since \u03c3 \u2208 {\u22121, +1}, there are\n2N \u2248 104704 different lattice configurations. We further introduce the average action per\nsite, i.e.\n\u001c\n\u001c \u001c\n\u001d\n\u001d\n\u001c\n\u001d\n1 X\n1 X\ns\u0304 =\n\u03c3x \u03c3y =\nA(x) = A(x) =: \u0100\n(77)\nN <xy>\nN x\nwhere\n\nA(x) :=\n\nX\n\n\u03c3x \u03c3y ,\n\ny>x,|x\u2212y|=1\n\nX\n\n1 = 2,\n\n(78)\n\ny>x,|x\u2212y|=1\n\nand where we have used translational invariance. A measure for the strength of the fluctuations of the action around its average value N s\u0304 is given by\n*\n!2 +\n*\"\n#2 +\nX\nX\n\u0001\n2\n\u03b4 =\n\u03c3x \u03c3y \u2212 N s\u0304\n=\nA(x) \u2212 \u0100\n(79)\n=\n\nX\nx,y\n\n<xy>\n\nA(x) \u2212 \u0100\n\n\u0001\n\nx\n\n\u0001\nA(y) \u2212 \u0100 .\n\nThe crucial observation is that the connected correlation function\nD\n\u0001\n\u0001E\nD(x \u2212 y) :=\nA(x) \u2212 \u0100 A(y) \u2212 \u0100\n\n(80)\n\n(81)\n\nexponentially decreases for large values of |x \u2212 y|, i.e. D(x) \u221d exp{\u2212x/\u03beA }, where \u03beA is\nthe correlation length characteristic for fluctuations in the action density. Hence, one finds\nthat its integrated strength, the so-called susceptibility \u03c1, is finite at least for \u03b2 6= \u03b2c ,\ni.e.,\nX\n\u03c1 :=\nD(x) < \u221e .\n(82)\nx\n\nThese findings tell us that the standard deviation \u03b4 (80) linearly grows with the number\nof sites, i.e. \u03b4 2 = N \u03c1.\n\nUsing the central limit theorem to estimate the probability for accepting an action density\ns, we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015N\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n(Ns \u2212 N s\u0304)2\n(s \u2212 s\u0304)2\nPA \u2248 exp \u2212\n.\n(83)\n= exp \u2212\n\u03b42\n\u03c1\n\nHence, in the case of many sites, only configurations with an action per site close to the\naverage action density can significantly contribute to the partition function. If we randomly\nchoose the spins on the sites the action density can take any value between \u22121 and 1, and\n22\n\n\fthe argument (s \u2212 s\u0304)/\u03c1 is generically of order 1. Hence the acceptance rate is down to\ne\u2212128\u00d7128 \u2248 10\u22127115 .\nThe basic idea is to only generate configurations which are relevant. Starting from a seed\nconfiguration c0 , we will generate subsequent configurations c1 , c2 , . . . , where the result\nfor ci+1 should only depend on the precessing configuration ci and must not depend on the\nconfigurations ci\u22121 . In this case, the set of configurations,\nc0 \u2212\u2192 c1 \u2212\u2192 c2 \u2212\u2192 c3 \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 c\u221e\nis called a Markov chain. Central ingredient to a Markov chain is the probability W (b, a)\nwith which configuration b is created out of configuration a. This probability must satisfy\ncertain constraints:\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nP\nNormalisation\nb W (b, a) = 1, \u2200a\nErgodicity\nW\nP(b, a) > 1, \u2200a, b\nStability\na W (b, a) P (a) = P (b), \u2200b ,\n\nwhere P (a) is given in (76). If these conditions are met, the series ci converges to a configuration which is distributed according to P (c\u221e ) (76). In order to see this, we introduce\nthe probability Qi (c) for finding a configuration c at position i of the Markov chain, and\ndenote the deviation from the desired distribution by\nX\n(84)\nQi (c) \u2212 P (c) .\n\u01ebi =\nc\n\nBecause of property (ii), there is a Wmin with\nW (a, b) \u2265 Wmin > 0 ,\n\nW \u2032 (a, b) := W (a, b) \u2212 Wmin \u2265 0 .\n\nFurthermore, the condition (i) implies that\nX\nQi (c) = 1 ,\n\nas\n\nc\n\nX\n\nP (c) = 1 .\n\n(85)\n\n(86)\n\nc\n\nUsing the stability condition (iii), we then obtain:\n\u01ebi+1 =\n\nXX\nc\n\n=\n\nc\n\n=\n\na\n\nXX\na\n\nXX\nc\n\na\n\nW (c, a)Qi (a) \u2212 P (c) =\n\nXX\n\nh\ni\nW (c, a) Qi (a) \u2212 P (a)\n\nh\ni c a X\n[Qi (a) \u2212 P (a)]\nW (c, a) Qi (a) \u2212 P (a) + Wmin\n\u2032\n\nh\ni\nW (c, a) Qi (a) \u2212 P (a) .\n\u2032\n\n23\n\na\n\n(87)\n\n\fUsing the triangle inequality and the positivity of W \u2032 , we find\nXX\n\u01ebi+1 \u2264\nW \u2032 (c, a) Qi (a) \u2212 P (a) .\n\n(88)\n\nChanging the order of summation and using (see (85))\nX\nX\nW \u2032 (c, a) =\n(W (c, a) \u2212 Wmin) = 1 \u2212 nconf Wmin ,\n\n(89)\n\nwhere nconf is the number of configurations, we finally find convergence:\nX\n\u01ebi+1 \u2264 [1 \u2212 nconf Wmin ]\nQi (a) \u2212 P (a) = [1 \u2212 nconf Wmin ] \u01ebi .\n\n(90)\n\nc\n\nc\n\na\n\nc\n\na\n\nInstead of demanding the less stringent condition (iii), one often demands detailed balance:\n(iii) \u2032\n\nW (b, a) P (a) = W (a, b) P (b) .\n\nThe latter condition immediately leads to condition (iii) if we sum the equation (iii) \u2032 over\nthe configurations a:\nX\nX\nW (b, a) P (a) =\nW (a, b) P (b) = P (b) ,\na\n\na\n\nwhere we have used condition (i). Since condition (iii) follows from (iii) \u2032 and only (iii) is\nnecessary for our proof above, demanding detailed balance, i.e., (iii) \u2032 , is more restrictive.\n\n3.2\n\nHeat-bath algorithm\n\nThe heat-bath algorithm works as follows: (i) randomly choose a site x0 and consider the\ncorresponding spin \u03c3(x0 ) for the update. Since the spin only interacts with its nearest\nneighbours, the interaction can be written as\nX\nH = const. \u2212 h0 \u03c3x0 ,\nh0 =\n\u03c3x .\n(91)\n<xx0 >\n\nThe relative probability for choosing \u03c3(x0 ) = 1 is given by exp{h0 \u03b2}, and the relative\nprobability for \u03c3(x0 ) = \u22121 is given by exp{\u2212h0 \u03b2}. (ii) Calculate the absolute probability\np =\n\nexp{\u03b2h0 }\nexp{\u2212\u03b2h0 } + exp{\u03b2h0 }\n\n(92)\n\nwith which the spin \u03c3x0 must be set to 1. Choose a random number z \u2208 [0, 1]. For z < p,\nchoose \u03c3x0 = 1 otherwise choose \u03c3x0 = \u22121. (iii) Subsequently, pick another spin for the\nupdate and start again with (i). Once all spins have been visited at least once, one sweep\nhas been performed.\n24\n\n\f\u03b2 = 0.10\n\n\u03b2 = 0.38\n\n\u03b2 = 0.42\n\n\u03b2 = 0.46\n\nFigure 8: Thermalised spin configurations of the 2d Ising model for several \u03b2 values\nstarting from high temperature phase to the low temperature ordered phase.\nThe algorithm above needs an initial configuration. We could choose a unique orientation of all spins. Since this is the ground state of the Hamiltonian which dominates the\npartition function for small values of the temperature, this initialisation is called a cold\nstart. Alternatively, we could start with a random orientation of the spins. This is a configuration which is relevant at very high temperatures where interactions are negligible.\nThis initialisation is therefore called a hot start. Independently of our choice, a number\nof sweeps is carried out to generate a statistically relevant configuration. This procedure\nis known as thermalisation. The number required to arrive at an equilibrated spin lattice\ndepends on the number of degrees of freedom and the temperature.\nLet us now examine typical lattice spin configurations. Starting at low \u03b2, the sample\nconfigurations are highly disordered (see figure 8). Increasing \u03b2 up to \u2248 0.3, the clusters of\nspins with the same orientation already extend over several lattice spacings. Approaching\nthe critical value, e.g. for \u03b2 \u2248 0.42, the clusters are already as large as the lattice. This\n25\n\n\fobservation reflects the growth of the spin correlation length which, for the present case,\nis\n\u22121\nT\n> T ) ,\n,\n(T \u223c\n(93)\n\u03be \u2248 \u03be+ 1 \u2212\nc\nTc\nand hence diverges when \u03b2 \u2192 \u03b2c .\nIf our numerical approach should produce the configurations of a Markov chain, the configurations may not depend on the Monte-Carlo history. To find out whether the configurations are indeed statistically independent, we may inspect the autocorrelation time \u03c4\ne.g. say for the magnetisation M (recall subsection 1.3 for discussions of autocorrelations).\nTo guarantee independence, we perform about 2\u03c4 Monte-Carlo sweeps before we consider\na configuration eligible for contributing to an estimator. In the case of the heat bath algorithm (in fact, for all local update algorithms), one discovers that the autocorrelation time\nstrongly increases when the critical point is approached. This implies that the interesting\nregime of the model, namely the regime close to the phase transition, is not accessible\nwith these types of algorithm. The reason for this is the following: consider a spin inside\none of the clusters. All the neighbouring spins are pointing in the same direction. If this\nspin is now subjected to a local update procedure, the spin hardly changes because of the\nstrong mean field produced by the other spins. Hence, only the boundaries of the cluster are significantly modified after one sweep through the lattice. The correct physics is,\nhowever, described by configurations consisting of strongly fluctuating clusters. In order\nto change a cluster completely, there are roughly \u03be 2 lattice sweeps necessary. Hence, only\nafter \u03be 2 sweeps, the configuration has changed significantly. This, however, implies that\nthe autocorrelation time is roughly given by \u03c4 \u2248 \u03be 2 . Indeed, it was empirically observed\nfor the Metropolis algorithm that\n\u03c4 \u2248 \u03bez ,\n\nzMetro \u2248 2.125 .\n\n(94)\n\nThe index z is called the dynamical critical exponent and depends on the algorithm. Since\nthe physical correlation length \u03be diverges at the phase transition, (94) implies that the\nregime near the phase transition cannot be simulated with local update algorithms.\n\n3.3\n\nCluster update algorithms\n\nState-of-the-art simulations which explore the transition regime use the so-called cluster\nalgorithms. The difference to local update algorithms is that many spins are flipped at a\ntime. To derive the prescription of such a cluster update, we rewrite the partition function\n(55) as\n!\nX\nX\nX Y\n\u0001\nZ=\nexp \u03b2\n\u03c3x \u03c3y =\nexp \u03b2 \u03c3x \u03c3y .\n(95)\n{\u03c3x }\n\n<xy>\n\n{\u03c3x } <xy>\n\nIf both neighbouring spins, \u03c3x and \u03c3y , in (95) are equal, the probabilistic factor in (95)\nequals exp \u03b2. For an opposite orientation of the spins, the probabilistic factor is given by\n26\n\n\fexp(\u2212\u03b2). We therefore cast (95) into\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX Y\n\u03b2\nZ=\ne (1 \u2212 p) + p \u03b4\u03c3x \u03c3y ,\n{\u03c3x } <xy>\n\np := 1 \u2212 e\u22122\u03b2 .\n\n(96)\n\nWe now are going to make the representation of the partition function even more involved\nby using the identity\n\u0015\n1 \u0014\nX\na+b =\na \u03b4n0 + b \u03b4n1 .\nn=0\n\nIntroducing variables nxy \u2208 {0, 1}, which are associated with each link of the lattice, we\nobtain\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX X Y\n\u03b2\n(97)\nZ=\ne (1 \u2212 p) \u03b4nxy ,0 + p \u03b4\u03c3x \u03c3y \u03b4nxy ,1 .\n{\u03c3x } {nxy } <xy>\n\nThe cluster update prescription is now obtained by performing standard heat bath steps\nfor the variables {\u03c3x } and {nxy }.\nLet us consider the update for the link variables nxy first. In order to avoid generating a\nconfiguration of vanishing probability, we must choose nxy = 0 if the neighbouring spins\n{\u03c3x } and {\u03c3y } are different (see (97)). If these spins are equally oriented, the probabilistic\nmeasure in (97)) is given by\n(1 \u2212 p) \u03b4nxy ,0 + p \u03b4nxy ,1 ,\nimplying that the link nxy is set to 1 with probability p. Given an initial spin distribution,\nthe values of all link variables can be chosen according to the above prescription.\nLet us now consider the spin update. According to probabilistic measure, i.e.,\n(1 \u2212 p) \u03b4nxy ,0 + p \u03b4\u03c3x \u03c3y \u03b4nxy ,1 ,\nall spins which are connected by links nxy = 1 must be of equal orientation. All spins\nwhich are connected by so-called activated links, i.e., nxy = 1, are said to be part of a\ncluster. The task is now to find all such clusters on the lattice. Once these clusters have\nbeen identified, we assign \u00b11 (with equal probability) to all spins of the same cluster.\nThis first versions of such cluster update algorithms are due to Fortuin and Kasteleyn [5],\nSwendsen and Wang [6] and Wolff [7]. It is found empirically that the dynamical critical\nexponent is strongly reduced:\n\u03c4 \u2248 \u03bez ,\n\nzcluster \u2248 0.2 .\n\nIntroductory discussions can be found in [5\u20138].\n27\n\n(98)\n\n\f4\n4.1\n\nQuantum field theories on computers\nQuantum mechanics\n\nLet us assume that the motion of a particle of mass m in 1 dimension is governed by a\npotential V (x).

Once one has succeeded\nin calculating the partition function (100), thermodynamical quantities can be easily obtained by taking derivatives, e.g., the temperature dependence of the internal energy is\ngiven by\nd ln Z(T )\nhHi = T 2\n.\n(102)\ndT\nAlthough a direct calculation of the eigenstates hn| of the Hamiltonian might be the easiest\nway to calculate a quantum mechanical partition function in practical applications, I would\nlike to reformulate (100) in terms of a functional integral. This will be of great help when\nwe generalise the quantum mechanical considerations to the case of a quantum field theory.\nFor these purposes, I introduce a length scale L := 1/T and an interval [0, L] which I\ndecompose into N equidistant portions of length a \u226a L, where a is called lattice spacing.\nIt is trivial to obtain\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u001a X\n\u001b\nN\nN\nY\n1\nexp \u2212 H\n= exp \u2212\naH\n=\nexp{\u2212 a H} .\n(103)\nT\n\u03bd=1\n\u03bd=1\nLet us define complete sets of momentum and position eigenstates (|pi and |xi, respectively)\nby\nZ\nZ\n1 =\n\ndx\u03bd |x\u03bd i hx\u03bd | ,\n\n1 =\n\ndp\u03bd |p\u03bd i hp\u03bd | ,\n\nfor \u03bd = 1 . . .

Note also that\nin view of the \u03b4-function in (106) only trajectories which are periodic in Euclidean time\nmust be considered, i.e., x(0) = x(L = 1/T ).\n\n4.2\n\nQuantum field theory\n\nFor illustration purposes, we consider the 1-dimensional particle chain in figure 9. Here,\nthe positions of the particles i = 0 . . . n are characterised by their extensions ui from the\nequilibrium position. The particles experience a harmonic potential depending on the\n\n30\n\n\fdistance to the nearest neighbour. Here, I choose the boundary conditions u0 = 0, un = 0.\nThe Hamiltonian, which describes the classical physics, is given by\n\u0015\nn\u22121 \u0014\nX\nD\n1 2\n2\np +\n(ui+1 \u2212 ui ) .\n(110)\nH =\n2m i\n2\ni=1\nHence the classical partition function is given by the multi-dimensional integral\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\nH\n.\nZcla(T ) \u221d\ndp1 . . . dpn\u22121 du1 . . . dun\u22121 exp \u2212\nT\n\n(111)\n\nIn order to calculate the full quantum mechanical partition function of the particle chain,\nwe first write down the Euclidean partition function. Note for this purpose that the\ndisplacements ui now acquire an additional dependence on the Euclidean time ui \u2192 ui(\u03c4 ) \u2261\nu\u03c4 i . With this notation the Euclidean action is given by\n\u0015\nn\u22121 \u0014\nN X\nX\nm\nD\n2\n2\na\nSE =\n(u\u03c4, i \u2212 u\u03c4 \u22121, i ) +\n(u\u03c4, i+1 \u2212 u\u03c4, i ) .\n(112)\n2a2\n2\n\u03c4 =1 i=1\n\nThe interactions between the c-number fields u\u03c4 i can be easily visualised (see figure 9): the\nfields u\u03c4 i harmonically interact with their nearest neighbours. The harmonic interaction\nstrength is given by D/2 in space direction and m/2a2 for neighbours in Euclidean time\ndirection. The quantum mechanical partition function can be calculated by integrating\nover of the fields u\u03c4 i located at the sites of a 2-dimensional grid, .i.e.\nZ\nZ(T ) \u221d\nDu exp{\u2212SE } ,\n(113)\nwhere the temperature enters the consideration via the extension of the lattice in Euclidean\ntime direction with fields obeying periodic boundary conditions.\n\nTo conclude, we observe that the partition function of a classical D + 1 dimensional field\ntheory (in lattice regularisation) describes the full partition function of a D dimensional\nquantum system. D is the number of space dimensions. This correspondence is very\nhelpful in understanding the quantum behaviour of a theory, since it can be mapped to a\nclassical field theory (at the expense of an additional dimension). In the next section, we\nwill study classical partition functions in 4-dimensional Euclidean space in order to derive\nthe information on the thermodynamics of the full quantum system.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nLattice gauge theory\nThe gauged Ising model\n\nThe Ising model, strictly speaking the partition function (55), is invariant under the global\ntransformation of the spins given by\n\u03c3 \u03a9 (x) = \u03a9 \u03c3(x) ,\n31\n\n\u03a9 = \u00b11 .\n\n(114)\n\n\fThe transformation is called global because the transformation affects all spins at the same\ntime, i.e., \u03a9 is independent of the coordinates (sites). The corresponding symmetry group\nis Z2 .\nThis symmetry group can be generalised to a local symmetry, also known as gauge symmetry, by demanding invariance under\n\u03c3 \u03a9 (x) = \u03a9(x) \u03c3(x) ,\n\n\u03a9(x) = \u00b11 .\n\n(115)\n\nOf course, the action (56) of the standard Ising model is not invariant under the huge\nsymmetry group which is now [Z2 ]N , where N is the number of sites. In order to obtain\na version of the Ising model which possesses a Z2 gauge symmetry, we need to change the\naction. The only way to do it, is to introduce an additional field, Z\u03bc (x). This field is\nassociated with the links of the lattice: x specifies the site and \u03bc the direction in which we\nfind the link. Alternatively, we could write:\nZ\u03bc (x) = Zhxyi ,\n\ny = x + \u00ea\u03bc ,\n\nwhere \u00ea\u03bc is the unit vector in \u03bc direction. For the latter expression, we will also abbreviate\nx + \u00ea\u03bc = x + \u03bc .\nFor the action, we choose\nSmatter = \u03ba\n\nX\n\n\u03c3(x) Z\u03bc (x) \u03c3(x + \u03bc) ,\n\n(116)\n\nhxyi\n\nand demand that the link Z\u03bc transforms under gauge transformations as\nZ\u03bc\u03a9 (x) = \u03a9(x) Z\u03bc (x) \u03a9(x + \u03bc) .\n\n(117)\n\nSince spin and link transform simultaneously with the same \u03a9(x) and since \u03a92 (x) = 1, one\neasily proves the gauge invariance of the action (116).\nObviously, the action Smatter describes the interaction between the matter fields, i.e., the\nspins, and the new link fields. What is left to do is to design a gauge invariant action for\nthese new degrees of freedom. This interaction should be short ranged in order to preserve\nsome desirable features such as universality. A possible choice is\nX\nSlink = \u03b2\nP\u03bc\u03bd (x) ,\nP\u03bc\u03bd (x) = Z\u03bc (x) Z\u03bd (x + \u03bc) Z\u03bc (x + \u03bd) Z\u03bd (x) .\n(118)\nx, \u03bc>\u03bd\n\nHere, the numbers (x, \u03bc > \u03bd) specify the plaquette of the lattice the lower left corner\nof which is located at site x and which is spanned by the directions \u03bc and \u03bd. The field\ncombination P\u03bc\u03bd (x) is often called the plaquette for short. The proof that P\u03bc\u03bd (x) is indeed\ninvariant under gauge transformations (117) is left to the reader.\n32\n\n\fThe total action of the gauged Ising model consists of two parts: the matter part and the\n\"gauge\" part. Correspondingly, there are two coupling constants: the convention is that \u03b2\nis the pre-factor in the pure gauge action, while \u03ba multiplies the matter part.\nOnce our system is now gauged, it only makes sense to consider gauge invariant observables\nsince non-gauge invariant quantities vanish. Let us explore this for a simple gauge variant\nquantity such as the spin correlation function:\nn\no\n1 X\n\u03c3(x0 ) \u03c3(y0 ) exp S[\u03c3] ,\nS[\u03c3] = Smatter + Slink , (119)\nC(x0 , y0) =\nZ\n{\u03c3}\nn\no\nX\nZ =\nexp S[\u03c3] ,\n(120)\n{\u03c3}\n\nLet us now consider a particular gauge transformation (115) of the spins, i.e.,\n\u001a\n\u22121\nfor x = x0\n\u03a9(x) =\n1\nelse\n\n(121)\n\nRenaming all spins in the sum in (119) by \u03c3(x) \u2192 \u03c3 \u03a9 (x), we use the gauge invariance of\nthe action and the sum , i.e.,\nX\nX\nS[\u03c3] = S[\u03c3 \u03a9 ] ,\n=\n.\n{\u03c3}\n\n{\u03c3\u03a9 }\n\nThe sum is trivially invariant, since we sum anyhow over all possible \u00b11 combinations for\nthe spins. Thus, we obtain:\nn\no\n1 X \u03a9\n\u03a9\nC(x0 , y0 ) =\n\u03c3 (x0 ) \u03c3 (y0 ) exp S[\u03c3]\nZ\n{\u03c3}\nn\no\n1 X\n[\u2212 \u03c3(x0 )] \u03c3(y0) exp S[\u03c3] = \u2212 C(x0 , y0 ) ,\n(122)\n=\nZ\n{\u03c3}\n\nwhere we used our particular choice (121) in the last line above. We conclude from this\nthat C(x0 , y0 ) = 0.\n\n5.2\n\nPure Z2 gauge theory: 3 and 4 dimensions\n\nLet us now consider the particular case \u03ba = 0 when the matter fields are absent from the\ntheory. The emerging theory is called pure Z2 gauge theory, and it is a theory of link fields\nonly. What are the physical (i.e. gauge invariant) degrees of freedom in this case? Let us\nconsider the more interesting case of 3 and 4 dimensions for these considerations. In order\nto talk about gauge invariant information, we now consider the plaquettes Pp , p = (x; \u03bc\u03bd),\ndefined in (118). We say that a short flux line (vortex) passes through the plaquette p if\n33\n\n\flink = \u22121\n\nflux line\n\nFigure 10: Flux passing through an elementary cube (left) and closed flux lines on a 3d\nlattice (right).\nPp = \u22121. Since the plaquette variables P are gauge invariant, so are the flux lines. More\nformally, we introduce a vortex plaquette variable by\nY\nZl\n(123)\nvp =\nl\u2208p\n\nand consider the flux lines which enter/leave an elementary cube of the lattice. We take\nthe product of all vortex plaquettes which are associated with the faces of the elementary\ncube and find\nY\nvp = (\u22121)\u03bd ,\n(124)\np\u2208c\n\nwhere \u03bd is the total number of vortices at the faces of the cube. Inserting the definition\n(123), we also find that\nY\nYY\nvp =\nZl = 1 ,\n(125)\np\u2208c\n\np\u2208c l\u2208p\n\nsince in the latter products all Zl factors appear twice (see figure 10, left panel; remember\nZl2 = 1). Comparing (125) with (124), we realise that \u03bd must be even. In particular, \u03bd = 1\nis excluded implying that a vortex never ends inside a cube. Considering 3 dimensions\n(or the spatial hypercube of 4-dimensional space time), we find that the gauge invariant\nvortices form closed lines in space. See figure 10, right panel, for an illustration.\n\n4 dimensions:\nLet us consider the 4 dimensional model first. The constraint (125) is\nmost easily interpreted on the dual lattice. A plaquette p of the original lattice maps onto\n34\n\n\fa plaquette \u2217 p of the dual lattice, and a cube c corresponds to a link \u2217 l on the dual lattice.\nHence, the constraint (125) reads on the dual lattice\nY\nv\u2217 p = 1 .\n(126)\n\u2217 p\u2208\u2217 l\n\nThis simply means that the number of vortex plaquettes which are attached to a link on\nthe dual lattice must be even. Accordingly, the vortex plaquettes form closed surfaces on\nthe dual lattice. If n denotes the number of negative plaquettes on the original lattice, the\nnumber of trivial plaquettes in 4 dimension is 6N \u2212 n, where N is the number of lattice\npoints. Hence, the probabilistic weight of such a configuration is:\n[exp {\u03b2}]6N \u2212n [exp {\u2212\u03b2}]n = exp {6N \u03b2} exp {\u22122\u03b2 n} ,\nso that the partition function can be written as\nX\nZ = exp {6N \u03b2}\nexp {\u22122\u03b2 n} .\n{closed surfaces}\n\n(127)\n\nLet us interpret this partition function: the degrees of freedom are closed two dimensional\nsheets (2-branes) embedded in four dimensions. The surface A of these branes is given by\nn. Hence, the probabilistic factor is given by\nn\no\nexp \u22122\u03b2 A\n\nimplying that 2\u03b2 can be interpreted as the surface tension. At zero temperature (\u03b2 \u2192 \u221e),\nthe empty vacuum (no 2-branes) is realised. At finite temperatures, the brane entropy\ncompetes with the penalty from the weight factor. A direct calculation of the entropy\nof 2d world-sheets in 4d would be cumbersome. However, exploiting the relation to the\nZ2 gauge theory makes the calculation of brane expectation values easily accessible by\nnumerical means.\nLet us proceed to obtain the duality map of the 4d Z2 gauge theory. The basic trick\nto perform the sum over the closed surfaces is to introduce degrees of freedom which\nautomatically resolve the constraint. In the present case, these are links \u2217 Z\u2217l on the dual\nlattice. Let us consider\ni\nX Yh\n1 + t P\u2217p [\u2217 Z] ,\n(128)\n{\u2217 Z\u2217l }\n\n\u2217p\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere P\u2217p [ Z] is the plaquette generated by the links \u2217 Z on the dual lattice. When we\nremove the brackets in (128), the only way to have a non-vanishing contribution to the\nsum is by making sure that each link \u2217 Z\u2217l appears an even number of times. This, however,\nmeans that the negative plaquettes P\u2217p [\u2217 Z] form closed surfaces. Hence, we find\ni\nX Yh\nX\n1 + t P\u2217p [\u2217 Z] = 24N\ntn .\n(129)\n\u2217\n{ Z\u2217l } \u2217p\n{closed surfaces}\n35\n\n\fNote that there are 4N links on the 4 dimensional lattice and that the factor 24N arises\nfrom the sum over \u2217 Z\u2217l . Thus, using (129) in (127), we find\ni\nX Yh\nZ = exp {6N \u03b2} 2\u22124N\n1 + t P\u2217p [\u2217 Z] ,\nt = exp{\u22122\u03b2} .\n(130)\n{\u2217 Z\u2217l }\n\n\u2217p\n\nSince the plaquette P\u2217p [\u2217 Z] only acquires values \u00b11, we may write:\nn\no\ni\nY\nYh\n\u2217\n6N\n\u2217\ne\ne\ne\nexp \u03b2 P\u2217p [ Z] = [cosh \u03b2]\n1 + tanh \u03b2 P\u2217p [ Z] .\n\u2217p\n\n(131)\n\n\u2217p\n\nThe partition function (130) therefore becomes\nZ =\n\n\u0014\n\nexp{\u03b2}\ncosh \u03b2e\n\n\u00156N\n\n2\u22124N\n\nX\n\n{\u2217 Z\n\nexp{\u22122\u03b2} = tanh \u03b2e .\n\n\u2217l }\n\nn X\no\nexp \u03b2e\nP\u2217p [\u2217 Z] ,\n\n(132)\n\n\u2217p\n\n(133)\n\nFirst of all we note that the dual of pure Z2 gauge theory is another 4-dimensional Z2\ngauge theory: the model is self-dual. Furthermore, relation (133) is already familiar to us:\nwe have obtained a complete analogue of the relation between \u03b2 and its dual \u03b2e for the 2d\nIsing model. We therefore once again encounter the fact that the weak coupling regime is\nmapped to the strong coupling regime of the same model. As a byproduct we find that\nthe critical coupling is given by\n\u03b2c =\n\n\u221a\n1\nln(1 + 2) \u2248 0.44068679 . . . .\n2\n\n(134)\n\nThe fact that the critical couplings of the 2d Ising model and 4d pure Z2 gauge theory\ncoincide might be a numerical accident. At least, I do not know any deeper reason for\nit. I finally point out that the Z2 gauge symmetries of the original and the dual formulation are completely unrelated. This can be most easily seen from the fact that, at an\nintermediate stage, we have formulated the model entirely in terms of physical, i.e., gauge\ninvariant variables: the closed vortex sheets of the dual lattice. Resolving this constraint,\nthe gauge invariance of the dual model arose from a parameterisation invariance, namely,\nthe redundancy when we performed the sum over all closed world sheets with the help of\ndual gauge links \u2217 Z.\n3 dimensions:\nLet us finally discuss the 3-dimensional model. In 3 dimensions, a\nplaquette p is mapped to a link \u2217 l and a cube c is mapped to a site \u2217 x on the dual lattice.\nThe constraint (125) then translates to\nY\nv\u2217 l = 1 .\n(135)\n\u2217 l\u2208\u2217 x\n\n36\n\n\fThe plaquettes carrying negative flux on the original lattice are represented by links forming\nclosed loops on the dual lattice.

This has tremendous consequences: for the standard Ising model, cluster\nupdate algorithms are available. Using the Swendsen-Wang or Wolff type cluster update,\nwe are able to simulate a gauge theory with much less autocorrelations. Unfortunately,\nsuch a framework is not (yet) available for more relevant theories such as lattice Yang-Mills\ntheories.\n\n5.3\n\nSetting up lattice Yang-Mills theory\n\nDue to the universality conjecture, the lattice model with the correct number of dimensions\nand the correct symmetries uniquely defines the corresponding quantum field theory in the\ncritical limit. The purpose of the present subsection is to propose a classical lattice model\nwhich satisfies these prerequisites in the case of Yang-Mills theory.\nThe QCD matter fields (quarks) belong to the fundamental representation of the so-called\nSU(Nc ) colour group (Nc = 3 for QCD). Gauge invariance means that the action of the\nquark fields is invariant under the local unitary transformations, i.e.,\nq(x) \u2192 q \u2032 (x) = \u03a9(x) q(x) ,\n\n\u03a9(x) \u2208 SU(Nc ). .\n\n(140)\n\nAs explained in many text books, local gauge invariance of the quark kinetic term may\nonly be achieved by introducing additional dynamical fields, the gluon fields A\u03bc (x).\n\n37\n\n\fgauge transformation\nproduct of link variables\n\nP\n\nP =\n\nY\n\n+\n\u03a9 (x) P \u03a9 (y)\n\n\u03a9 (z+ \u03bc ) U \u03bd (z+\u03bc )...\n\nX\n\n+\n...U (z) \u03a9 (z+ \u03bc )\n\u03bc\n\n\u03bd\n\nZ\n\u03bc\n\nFigure 11: Path ordered product of link variables.\nThe quark fields are associated with the sites in a lattice formulation. Hence, the symmetry\ngroup of the classical lattice Yang-Mills model is [SU(Nc )]Ns , where Ns is the number of\nlattice sites. In order to enforce such a high symmetry in the critical limit of a lattice\nmodel, it has turned out essential to realise the symmetry even for finite values of the\nlattice spacing a. This in turn forces the model to maintain local gauge invariance in the\ncontinuum limit [9]. A potential candidate for a quark kinetic term in the non-interacting\ncase is\n\u0015\nX 1\u0014\nq\u0304(x) \u03b3\u03bc q(x + \u03bc) \u2212 q\u0304(x + \u03bc) \u03b3\u03bc q(x) ,\n(141)\n2\nx,\u03bc\nwhere the \u03b3\u03bc are the Euclidean \u03b3 matrices. Of course, the action (141) is not invariant under\nthe gauge transformations (140). To achieve this invariance, we introduce an additional\nfield of vector type, thus being related to the links of the lattice,\nU\u03bc (x) \u2208 SU(Nc ) .\n38\n\n(142)\n\n\f\u03bd\n\nP \u03bc\u03bd (x) =\n\n1\nNc tr\nx\n\n\u03bc\n\nplaquette\nFigure 12: Lattice plaquette variable\nGeneralising the quark kinetic term (141) to\n\u0015\nX 1\u0014\n\u2020\nq\u0304(x) \u03b3\u03bc U\u03bc (x) q(x + \u03bc) \u2212 q\u0304(x + \u03bc) \u03b3\u03bc U\u03bc (x) q(x) ,\nSQ =\n2\nx,\u03bc\n\n(143)\n\none obtains the desired local invariance upon demanding that the link fields transform as\nU\u03bc (x) \u2192 \u03a9(x) U\u03bc (x) \u03a9\u2020 (x + \u03bc) .\n\n(144)\n\nLet us follow the case of the gauged Ising model and construct a kinetic term for the link\nfields U\u03bc (x). For lattice models \"kinetic\" means that the interactions of the fields on the\nlattice are short range, i.e., only nearest neighbours are involved. In order to design a\ngauge invariant kinetic term for every value of the lattice spacing, we firstly investigate the\ntransformation properties of a path ordered product of link variables. Let us consider an\nopen path C which starts at point x and ends at y (see figure 11 for an illustration), and\ndefine\nY\nP (x, y) = P\nU(x) ,\n(145)\nx\u2208C\n\nwhere P implies path ordering. Inserting the gauge transformed links (144) into (145), one\nfinds\nP (x, y) \u2192 P \u2032(x, y) = \u03a9(x) P (x, y) \u03a9(y) .\n(146)\n\nWith the help of (145), it is easy to construct a kinetic term for the link variables which\n(i) is gauge invariant and (ii) involves only next to nearest neighbours. For this purpose\none chooses C to be a closed path starting at x and ending at y = x which encircles an\nelementary plaquette (see figure 12):\n1\ntr P (x, y)\nNc\no\n1 n\n=\ntr U\u03bc (x) U\u03bd (x + \u03bc) U\u03bc\u2020 (x + \u03bd) U\u03bd\u2020 (x) .\nNc\n\nP\u03bc\u03bd (x) =\n\n39\n\n(147)\n\n\fUsing (146) and the invariance of the trace under cyclic permutations, one easily shows\nthat the plaquette (147) is indeed gauge invariant.\nThe lattice partition function involves an integration over the dynamical fields of the theory.\nIn the case of the group valued link variables (142), the question arises which measure DU\u03bc\nshould be employed for the integrations. We must demand that the integration measure\ndoes not spoil gauge invariance. To ensure this we use the so-called Haar measure which\nsatisfies\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndU\u03bc (x) = d AU\u03bc (x)B ,\nA, B \u2208 SU(Nc ) .\n(148)\nThe Haar measure is available in closed form for the unitary groups SU(Nc ). Here, I will\nonly present the Haar measure for SU(2) group integrations. The SU(2) unitary matrix U\nis conveniently parameterised in terms of the Pauli matrices,\nU = a0 + i~a~\u03c4 ,\n\nUU \u2020 = 1 \u2192 a20 + ~a2 = 1 .\n\n(149)\n\nSince the constraint UU \u2020 = 1, i.e. a20 + ~a2 = 1, is not changed if U is multiplied with A\nfrom the left and B from the right, respectively, these multiplications can be viewed as\nrotations in the 4-dimensional space spanned by (a0 ,~a). Therefore, an invariant measure\ncan be defined by\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndU = da0 da1 da2 da3 \u03b4 a20 + ~a2 \u2212 1\n\n.\n\n(150)\n\nIntroducing polar coordinates for the 3-dimensional vector ~a := a~n, ~n~n = 1, the integration\nover the norm of the vector ~a can be performed with the help of the \u03b4 function in (150).\nWe obtain the final result for the SU(2) Haar measure, i.e.,\nq\n(151)\ndU = da0 1 \u2212 a20 d\u03a9~n ,\nwhich is commonly used in lattice simulations.\n\nFinally, the lattice representation of the gauge invariant partition function is given by\n\u001a\nZ\ni\u001b\nX 1h\n\u2020\nZ =\nDU Dq Dq exp \u2212SQ + \u03b2\nP\u03bc\u03bd (x) + h.c.\n,\n(152)\n2\nx,\u03bc>\u03bd\nwhere the quark interaction is encoded in SQ (143) and P\u03bc\u03bd (x) is the plaquette (147). \u03b2\nis related to the bare gauge coupling constant g of the continuum formulation by \u03b2 =\n2Nc /g 2. The particular choice (152) of the lattice regularised gluonic action is known as\nthe Wilson action [9]. Note that the fields q(x), q \u2020 (x) are anti-commuting Grassmann\nfields. This choice for the fermionic fields is necessary to obtain the correct Fermi statistics\nas well as to ensure the Pauli principle. It implies that the lattice model (152) cannot be\nstraightforwardly be used in numerical simulations. Rather, since the action for the quark\nfields is quadratic, the integration over the quark fields has to be performed analytically:\nZ\nn\no\nDq Dq \u2020 exp \u2212q\u0304A MAB qB = DetM[U] .\n(153)\n40\n\n\fwhere the index A comprises space-time as well as spinorial, etc. indices. The quark determinant DetM[U] is a gauge invariant function of the link variables U\u03bc (x). Note, however,\nthat the link interaction mediated by the quark determinant is non-local, implying that\na link at a particular site is coupled to all other links of the lattice. In practice, this\nimplies that a local update of a single link enforces the calculation of a functional determinant. This explains why the numerical simulation of Yang-Mills theory with dynamical\nquarks requires much more computational resources than the simulation of the theory in\nquenched approximation, where the quark determinant is neglected for the update of the\nlink variables.\n\n5.4\n\nThe fermion doubling problem\n\nIt turns out that the treatment of the quark degrees of freedom in (152) is still too naive:\nsince the Dirac equation is linear in momentum, its lattice analogue does not produce just\nthe desired quark degrees of freedom in the limit a \u2192 0, but rather 2D copies of them (D\nis the number of space time dimensions). This is already true for the free theory as will be\nshown in what follows.\nLet us firstly introduce the generating functional for connected Green functions in the case\nof free and massless bosonic theory,\n\u001b\n\u001a\nZ\n1\n(154)\nZ[j] =\nD\u03c6 exp \u2212 \u03c6k \u03a0kl \u03c6l + jx \u03c6x .\n2\nA sum is understood over indices which appear twice.

In order to reproduce the correct Fermi statistics,\nfermion fields \u03c8(x) are of Grassmann type and obey anti-periodic boundary conditions. I\nrefer to the textbook [2] for an introduction to the free fermionic theory, and only quote the\nfinal result for the correlation function which formally agrees with (159). In the continuum,\nthe eigenvalue equation is given by\n\u03a0\u03c8(x) = \u2202/\u03c8(x) = \u03bb \u03c8(x) ,\n\n(166)\n\nwhere anti-hermitian (Euclidean) \u03b3 matrices are used. The ansatz for the spinor wave\nfunctions is again of plane wave type,\n1\u0011\n2\u03c0 \u0010\nn+\n, n\u2208Z.\n(167)\n\u03c8(x) \u221d u(k) eikx ,\neikL = \u22121 ,\nk=\nL\n2\nThe spectrum \u03bb(k) is determined by making the ansatz\nh\ni\nu(k) = ik/ + \u03bb u0 ,\nwhich yields\n\nand therefore\n\nh\ni\nh\nih\ni\nik/ \u2212 \u03bb u(k) = ik/ \u2212 \u03bb ik/ + \u03bb u0 = 0 ,\nh\ni\n2\n2\nk \u2212 \u03bb u0 = 0 .\n\n(168)\n\n(169)\n(170)\n\n\u221a\nHence, the spectrum of the continuum theory is linearly increasing, \u03bb = \u00b1 k 2 . Using\nthe kinetic energy for a free quark theory introduced in (141), the lattice version of the\neigenvalue equation is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1X\n\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8(x + \u03bc) \u2212 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8(x \u2212 \u03bc) = \u03bb a \u03c8(x) .\n(171)\n2 \u03bc\nThe ansatz (167) also provides the eigenvectors of the eigenvalue problem (171). Repeating\nthe steps which have led to the continuum dispersion relation, one finds its lattice analogue\nsX\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u03bba =\nsin2 k\u03bc a .\n(172)\n\u03bc\n\nThe fermionic eigenvalue distribution is shown in figure (13), right panel. Close to the\ncritical limit (\u03bba \u226a 1), one recovers the continuum dispersion relation from (172) by\nmaking a Taylor expansion with respect to ka. In addition, a second singularity occurs for\nka \u2248 \u03c0. This shows that even if \u03bba \u226a 1 a second fermion flavour arises from the lattice\nfermion action (141).\n43\n\n\fIt can be shown that this fermion doubling problem must occur for a chirally invariant\naction which is translationally invariant and local (Nielsen-Ninomiya No-Go theorem).\nAt the present stage, a lot of research effort is devoted to incorporate chiral symmetry at\nthe expense of, say, a moderate non-locality of the action [10].\n\n5.5\n\nOverlap fermions\n\nIn the continuum formulation, the chirally invariant Dirac operator D satisfies the relations\n\b\n\b \u22121\nD, \u03b35 = 0 ,\nD , \u03b35 = 0 ,\n(173)\n\nwhich tells us that the non-zero eigenvalues \u03bb\u0304 appear in pairs {\u03bb\u0304, \u2212\u03bb\u0304}. Let D denote a\nlattice candidate of the Dirac operator (in units of the lattice spacing a) satisfying the\nso-called Ginsparg-Wilson relation [11],\n\b\nD, \u03b35 = 2 D \u03b35 D .\n(174)\nOne observes that the right hand side of (174) is of order a2 (compared with the order a of\nthe left hand side) implying that the naive continuum limit a \u2192 0 of (174) reduces to the\nchiral relation (173). The most important observation, however, is that a certain remnant\nof the chiral symmetry is still present in the lattice version. Defining\n\nand using\n\ne \u22121 := D \u22121 \u2212 1 ,\nD\n\b\n\u03b35 , D \u22121\n\n(175)\n\n= 2 \u03b35 ,\n\ne \u22121 may\nwhich directly follows from the Ginsparg-Wilson relation (174), we observe that D\nbe used as a chirally invariant quark propagator, i.e.,\n\b\ne \u22121 = 0 .\n\u03b35 , D\n(176)\n\nHence, we are left with the task to find an operator D obeying the Ginsparg-Wilson relation\n(174). Here, I will briefly discuss the Overlap Dirac operator [12]- [14], firstly introduced\nin the pioneering paper [12] by Narayanan and Neuberger. One introduces\ni\n1h\n1 + \u03b35 H ,\n(177)\nD =\n2\n\nwhere H is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues \u00b11. Common choice is\n\u0010\n\u00111/2\nH = Dw / Dw\u2020 Dw\n,\n\n(178)\n\nwhere Dw is the standard Hermitian Wilson-Dirac operator. Inserting (177) into (174), it\nis straightforward to prove that D from (177) satisfies the Ginsparg-Wilson relation (174).\nA comprehensive discussion of the quark propagator (175) in the context of a simulation\nof SU(3) Yang-Mills theory can be found in [15].\n44\n\n\fWilson loop:\n(screening) masses\n\nd\n\nt\n\nr\nFigure 14: Wilson loop and loop\u2013loop correlation function\n\n5.6\n\nMeasuring observables\n\nWe have observed that the trace of the path ordered product P (x, y) of link variables (145)\nis gauge invariant when taken along a closed curve C, i.e., x = y. Depending on the choice\nfor the loop C, the expectation value of such loop variables can be connected to physical\nobservables. For instance, for the so-called Wilson loop, we choose a rectangular loop with\nsize r in one spatial direction and the extension t in the Euclidean time direction (see figure\n14, left panel). In the limit of large t, the Wilson loop expectation value is related to the\npotential V (r) between a static quark and a static anti-quark which are separated by the\ndistance r, i.e.,\nD\nE\nn\no\nW [C] \u221d exp \u2212V (r) t ,\n(179)\nIn the particular case that the potential is linearly rising, V (r) = \u03c3r with string tension\n\u03c3, one observes that the Wilson loop expectation value exponentially decreases with the\narea A enclosed by the loop C. Since a linearly rising quark anti-quark potential implies\nconfinement (see discussion below), this area law (due to Wilson) is a litmus test for quark\nconfinement.\n\nFurthermore, one can calculate the correlation function L(tx \u2212ty , ~x \u2212~y ) of two loops centred\nat x and y, respectively (see figure 14), right panel). Here, information is transported from\npoint x to y by gauge invariant states |phi . The shape of a particular loop determines its\nbehaviour under the symmetry transformations of the underlying lattice. These symmetry\ntransformations correspond to rotations in the continuum limit. Therefore, it is possible\nto select the spin quantum number of the state |phi by adjusting the shape of the loop.\nFor large distances \u2206 = tx \u2212 ty , the correlation function exponentially decreases, i.e.,\nn\no\nX\nL(tx \u2212 ty , ~u = ~x \u2212 ~y ) \u221d exp \u2212 ma \u2206 .\n(180)\nu\n~\n\n45\n\n\f1.5\nSU(2) \u03b2=1.45\n\nV(r) a\n\n1.25\n1\n0.75\non-axis fit\n(100) data\n(110) data\n(111) data\n\n0.5\n0.25\n0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n8\n\n6\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nr/a\nFigure 15: The static quark anti-quark potential as obtained from pure SU(2) lattice\ngauge theory.

In the purely gluonic theory, the only gauge invariant states\nare the glue balls, while in full QCD also hadronic states contribute to the correlation functions.\n\n5.7\n\nThe continuum limit\n\nFor definiteness, I confine myself to the case of pure (i.e. no quarks) SU(2) gauge theory.\nThe generalisation of the findings of the present section to SU(Nc ) is straightforward. The\ntask is now to find the critical limit of the lattice Yang-Mills theory.\nThere is a lesson to learn from continuum Yang-Mills theory. In order to renormalise the\ncontinuum theory, one absorbs a logarithmic divergence into the bare gauge coupling.

This is one manifestation of the celebrated property of\nasymptotic freedom. Switching from the continuum to the lattice formulation we identify\n\u039b = \u03c0/a and use \u03b2 = 4/g 2 to straightforwardly derive\n\u001a\n\u001b\n6\u03c0 2\n2\na (\u03b2) = const. exp \u2212\n\u03b2 .\n(182)\n11\nDue to asymptotic freedom, we expect that the critical limit is approached when \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e.\nThe perturbative relation between a and \u03b2 in (182) is called asymptotic scaling.\nModern computer simulations use a more complicated \"kinetic\" term for the gluon fields.\nOne example of such an improved action is given by\ni\nXh\n(2)\nS = \u03b2\n\u03ba1 P\u0304\u03bc\u03bd (x) + \u03ba2 P\u0304\u03bc\u03bd\n(x) .\n(183)\n\u03bc>\u03bd,x\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P\u0304\u03bc\u03bd (x) is the 2 \u00d7 2 Wilson loop. Imposing the constraint\n\u03ba1 + 16 \u03ba2 = 1 ,\n\n(184)\n\nensures that the familiar relation between \u03b2 and the bare gauge coupling g, \u03b2 = 2Nc /g 2 ,\nis maintained. The residual freedom of choosing \u03ba1 and \u03ba2 can be used to obtain a rather\ngood agreement with asymptotic scaling on rather coarse lattices.\nIn order to search for the critical limit with the help of numerical simulations, we calculate\na physical quantity, e.g. the string tension \u03c3 in units of the lattice spacing as a function\n47\n\n\fof the only parameter \u03b2. This is done by calculating the static quark anti-quark potential\nV (r) as a function of the quark anti-quark distance r = n a. The outcome in units of the\nlattice spacing is shown in figure 15. By fitting the numerical data to\nV (r)a = v0 \u2212\n\n\u03b1\n+ \u03c3a2 n ,\nn\n\nwe find the string tension in units of the lattice spacing, \u03c3a2 , for each value of \u03b2. The\noutcome of this calculation is shown in figure 16. One indeed observes that the c-number\n\u03c3a2 exponentially decreases for large values of \u03b2 in agreement with the prediction (182) of\ncontinuum Yang-Mills theory. The quantum field theoretical limit of the classical lattice\nmodel is obtained by interpreting the correlation length, i.e., the string tension \u03c3 in the\npresent example, as a fixed physical quantity, and reinterpreting the \u03b2 dependence of the\nnumerical data for \u03c3a2 as the \u03b2 dependence of the lattice spacing.\nLet us assume we have obtained a glue ball mass m in lattice units, i.e., we know ma as\na function of \u03b2. If the mass m is a physical observable, one must recover from the data\nthe characteristic dependence a(\u03b2) (see (182)) for sufficiently large \u03b2 values. Hence, the\nratio of the two dimensionless numbers m2 a2 /\u03c3a2 approaches a constant for \u03b2 close to the\ncritical point (see figure 16, right panel). Extrapolating the data to the continuum limit\na \u2192 0, i.e.,\u221a \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e, one determines the physical mass m in units of another physical\nscale, i.e., \u03c3. Finally, let us count the number of parameters. The only parameter of\nthe classical lattice model is \u03b2, but \u03b2 is no longer at our disposal in the quantum field\ntheory\n\u221a limit (which implies \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e). However, the physical value of the correlation length\n(or \u03c3 in the present example) takes over the role of a free parameter. The replacement\nof a dimensionless parameter by a mass scale in the continuum limit is a feature of many\nquantum field theories and is called dimensional transmutation.\nOn the lattice every\n\u221a\nmass scale is obtained in units of the string tension, \u03c3 = 440 MeV is used to assign the\nfamiliar units of QCD to observables. For 32 lattice points in any space-time direction, we\nthen find:\n\u03b2 (input)\n\u03c3a2 (calculated)\nL = Na\n\u039b = \u03c0/a\n\n1.250\n1.400\n1.500\n1.600\n0.279(2) 0.0922(7) 0.0528(3) 0.0311(2)\n7.7 fm\n4.4 fm\n3.3 fm\n2.6 fm\n2.6 GeV 4.6 GeV\n6.0 GeV\n7.8 GeV\n\nFor a fixed number of lattice points, we note that we cannot make \u03b2 arbitrarily small since\nthe physical volume becomes too small. Small values of \u03b2 result in large volumes, but we\ncannot make \u03b2 too small in order to have a reasonably large UV cutoff. Thus, for a fixed\nnumber of points, there is a small window of \u03b2 values which are appropriate for a study of\nQCD particle properties. This window is sometimes called the scaling window.\nAcknowledgements: I thank Tom Heinzl and Martin Lavelle for a careful reading of\nthe manuscript and helpful comments.\n\n48\n\n\fReferences\n[1] P.
