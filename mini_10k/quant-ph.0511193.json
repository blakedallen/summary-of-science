Much work has been carried out by some approximate methods. One of the\nearliest variational calculations has been performed by Hylleraas [1] in 1929. Since this\ntime, many physicists have contributed incremental steps in this endeavor, often trying\nto use mathematical insight for advantage [2]-[16]. The strongest line of theory has been\nfocused on the analytic properties of the wave function, especially following the work of Fock\nin 1954 [2], which showed a weak logarithmic singularity at the three-particle coalescence.\nThe recent works of Korobov and Charles Schwartz ect get very high precision result for the\nnonrelativistic ionization [12, 13, 14, 17].\nBut most of these authors mainly lay their works on the precision and convergence of\nthe variational wave function except for the correction to Hamiltonian of a helium atom.\nEven the motion of nucleus is not considered, so the variational results are lower than the\nexperimental value [2]-[15]. In this paper, we first construct a simple but effective variational\nwave function with a flexible parameter k. Then, considering the motion of nucleus and the\nrelativistic and radiative effects, we give out all the corrections to the nonrelativistic ground\nenergy. Finally, the ground energy of a helium atom is worked out with the variational\nmethod and perturbation method.\nIt is well known that the Schr\u00f6dinger ground energy E and the corresponding wave\nfunction U are found as a solution of the variational problem\nR \u2217\nU HUd\u03c4\n.\nE = min R \u2217\nU\nU Ud\u03c4\n\n(1)\n\nFor a helium atom, we use a simple but effective variational wave function, which contains\nonly even powers of t, as follows\nU(r1 , r2 ) = \u03c6(ks, kt, ku) = e\u2212ks\n\nX\n\nClmn (ks)l (kt)2m (ku)n ,\n\n(2)\n\nlmn\n\ns = r1 + r2 , t = \u2212r1 + r2 , u = r12 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere r1 and r2 denote the positions of the electrons with respect to the nucleus; s, t and u\nare called Hylleraas coordinates [1]; k is a flexible scaling parameter. The function may be\nexpected to converge rapidly for medium-sized of s, t and u. The Hamiltonian is taken in\n\n2\n\n\ffollowing nonrelativistic approximation in many papers [2]-[15]\nH\u221e =\n\np21 p22\nZ\n1\nZ\n,\n+\n\u2212 \u2212 +\n2\n2\nr1 r2 r12\n\n(4)\n\nwhere p1,2 are the momenta of the electrons and Z = 2 is the nucleus charge (in units of\nthe proton charge). And the variational results in References [2]-[15] are lower than the\nexperimental value, which shows that the Hamiltonian form in Eq. (4) is not accurate\nenough. So the movement of the nucleus should not be ignored, and the nonrelativistic\nHamiltonian can be represented as follows\nH0 =\n\np21 p22\nZ\n1\nP2\nZ\n.\n+\n+\n\u2212 \u2212 +\n2\n2\n2M\nr1 r2 r12\n\n(5)\n\nHere P = \u2212p1 \u2212 p2 is the momentum of the nucleus and the finite nucleus-to-electron mass\nratio M \u2261 m\u03b1 /me = 7294.299508(16). From the later computational results, it can be seen\nclearly that the variational energy is higher than the experimental value.\nTo get more accurate result, we take into account the relativistic and radiative effects.\nThe following operator describes the Breit \u03b12 correction to the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian\n[18]\nH (2) = H1 + H2 + H3 + H4 + H5 ,\n\nH1 = \u2212\n\n\u03b12 4\n(p + p42 ),\n8 1\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b12 p1 * p2 (r12 * p1 )(r12 * p2 )\nH2 = \u2212\n,\n+\n3\n2\nr12\nr12\n\u03b12\nH3 =\n2\n\n\u001a\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u001b\nr12 \u00d7 p2\nr21 \u00d7 p1\nL1 \u00d7 p1 + 2\n* S1 + L2 \u00d7 p2 + 2\n* S2 ,\n3\n3\nr12\nr12\nH4 =\n\ni\u03b12\n(p1 * L1 + p2 * L2 ),\n4\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0015\u2032 \u001b\n8\u03c0\n3(S1 * r12 )(S2 * r12 )\n1\nH5 = \u03b1 \u2212 (S1 * S2 )\u03b4(r12 ) + 3 S1 * S2 \u2212\n.\n(11)\n2\n3\nr12\nr12\nHere L1 = \u2212\u22071 V (V = Z/r1 + Z/r2 \u2212 1/r12 ) is the Coulomb field due to nucleus plus the\n2\n\nsecond electron. The physical significance of the various terms in Eq. (6) is as follows:\nH1 is the relativistic correction due to the \"variation of mass with velocity\" (which does\nnot depend on electron spin). H2 corresponds to the classical relativistic correction to the\n3\n\n\finteraction between the electrons. This correction is due to the retardation of the electromagnetic field produced by an electron. H3 is the interaction between the spin magnetic\nmoment and the orbital magnetic moment of the electrons (spin-orbit coupling). H4 is a\nterm characteristic of the Dirac theory, which is also present in the Hamiltonian for a single\nelectron in an electric field. H5 represents the interaction between the spin magnetic dipole\nmoments of the two electrons.\nFor the ground state of helium-like atoms, l, s and j are all zero and there is no fine\nstructure splitting. Nevertheless, the operators H1 to H5 in Eq. (6) contribute relativistic\ncorrections to the nonrelativistic energy eigenvalue of relative order (Z\u03b1)2 and Z\u03b12 . These\ncorrections are only the leading terms in an expansion in powers of \u03b1 and Z\u03b1. And we\nexplicitly take into consideration that the spin of the nucleus and the total spin of electrons\nare both equal to zero. In particular, we replace the product of the electron spin operators\nS1 * S2 by its eigenvalue in the single state, \u22123/4. The expectation values of the operators\nH1 to H5 for the ground state of a helium atom with nuclear charge Z are\nE1 = \u2212\n\n\u03b12\n(< p41 > + < p42 >),\n8\n\n(12)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\np1 * p2\n(r12 * p1 )(r12 * p2 )\n\u03b12\n<\n>+<\n> ,\nE2 = \u2212\n3\n2\nr12\nr12\n\n(13)\n\nE3 = 0,\n\n(14)\n\nE4 = \u03c0\u03b12 < Z\n\n\u03b4(r1 ) + \u03b4(r2 )\n\u2212 \u03b4(r12 ) >,\n2\n\nE5 = 2\u03c0\u03b12 < \u03b4(r12 ) > .\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nThe angle brackets in Eqs. (12) to (16) and below denote the average value over the nonrelativistic ground state variational wave function. It can be shown that the expectation\nvalue E2 of the operator H2 vanishes if any wave function of product form U = u(r1 )u(r2 ) is\nused, i.e. both for the hydrogen-like and for the Hartree wave functions. If a more accurate\nfunction, which includes the effects of polarization, is used, then a finite (but numerically\nsmall) value is obtained for E2 . To simplify the presentation, we take E2 = 0. So, the total\n\n4\n\n\fBreit \u03b12 correction to the nonrelativistic value is\n\u03b4E (2) = \u03b12 < \u2212\n\np41 + p42\n\u03b4(r1 ) + \u03b4(r2 )\n+ \u03c0Z\n+ \u03c0\u03b4(r12 ) > .\n8\n2\n\n(17)\n\nOrder \u03b13 correction to the nonrelativistic energy can be represented as follows [19]\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001a\n19\n4Z\n(3)\n3\n\u22122 ln \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 +\n< \u03b4(r1 ) + \u03b4(r2 ) >\n\u03b4E\n= \u03b1\n3\n30\n\u0012\n\u001b\n\u0013\n14\n7\n164\nln r12 + \u03b3\n+\nin * p > .\n(18)\n\u03b4(r12 ) +\nln \u03b1 +\n<\n2\n3\n15\n3\u03c0\nr12\nHere\nn=\n\n\u2202\nr12\n, p = \u2212i\u2207 = \u2212i\n,\nr12\n\u2202r12\n\n(19)\n\n\u03b3 = 0.5772 is the Euler constant and \u03b2 = 4.3700392 is the helium Bethe logarithm [20].\nNow, we give out the calculations and results of the helium ground energy.\nFirstly, we shall discuss the ground state expectation values of the Dirac delta-function,\nthe square of the kinetic energy operator and the nonrelativistic energy, which evaluated by\nusing various wave functions.\nThe expectations of the three-dimensional Dirac delta-function \u03b4(r1 ) and \u03b4(r12 ) are\n< \u03b4(r1 ) >=\n\n< \u03b4(r12 ) >=\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c42 U 2 (0, r2 ) = 4\u03c0\n\nZ\u221e\n\nr 2 \u03c62 (r, r, r)dr,\n\n(20)\n\nZ\u221e\n\nr 2 \u03c62 (2r, 0, 0)dr.\n\n(21)\n\n0\n\n2\n\nd\u03c41 U (r1 , r1 ) = 4\u03c0\n\n0\n\nIt is very convenient to evaluate them in spherical coordinates.\nFor the square of the kinetic energy operator for electron 1, or p41 = \u220741 \u2261 \u220621 , we first\nnote the following equation\n\u22071 * [U\u22071 (\u22061 U) \u2212 (\u22061 U)\u22071 U] = U(\u220621 U) \u2212 (\u22061 U)2 .\n\n(22)\n\nFor any analytic function U that falls off exponentially at large distances, the integral of\nthe left side of Eq.

For the exact wave function,\n\u22061 U behaves like Z/r1 or like 1/r12 if r1 or r12 approaches to zero, just like the potential\nenergy in the total Hamiltonian. \u220621 U then has a delta-function type of singularity at r1 = 0\nand r12 = 0 and a wrong answer would be obtained if the first integral in Eq. (23) were\nevaluated by a limiting process which excludes an infinitesimal region around the origin and\naround r12 = 0. The second form of Eq. (23) is free from these difficulties and is, in any case,\neasier to evaluate in practice. Considering the exchange symmetry of the wave function, we\nhave < \u03b4(r1 ) >=< \u03b4(r2 ) > and < p41 >=< p42 >.\nThe expression of the nonrelativistic ground energy has the following form\nE0 =< H0 >=\n\nP\nK 2\nk + k,\nW\nW\n\n(24)\n\nwhere K is kinetic energy, P is potential energy and W is a normalization factor. The\nfunction E0 (k) is a quadratic parabola that take the minimum at k = \u2212P/2K. When the\nnumber of basis functions N is large enough, the value of k will fluctuate between 2.0451\nand 2.0452. For example, we get k = 2.0451486913735 when N = 50.\nSecondly, we will present the computational values for all the contributions to the helium\nground energy in atomic units (mp =1, ~=1 and e=1). The particular numerical results and\ntheir comparisons with the experimental value are collected in Table 1 and Table 2. E\u221e and\nE0 are calculated by variational method, \u03b4Echr , \u03b4E (2) and \u03b4E (3) by perturbation method.\n\nTable 1. Nonrelativistic energies E\u221e andE0 for the helium ground state and their\ncomparisons with the experimental value. E\u221e corresponds to the expectation value of H\u221e ,\nE0 to the expectation value of H0 and Eexp to the experimental value, which equals to\n\u22122.90338629 [21] (in atomic units). \u2206E\u221e = E\u221e \u2212 Eexp and \u2206E0 = E0 \u2212 Eexp .\nN\n\nE\u221e\n\n\u2206E\u221e\n\nE0\n\n\u2206E0\n\n20\n\n-2.90370938\n\n-0.00032309\n\n-2.90328962\n\n0.00009667\n\n30\n\n-2.90371945\n\n-0.00033316\n\n-2.90329969\n\n0.00008660\n\n40\n\n-2.90372103\n\n-0.00033474\n\n-2.90330128\n\n0.00008501\n\n50\n\n-2.90372124\n\n-0.00033495\n\n-2.90330389\n\n0.00008240\n\nTable 2.

(4) is not accurate enough. However, the case of E0 is opposite to that of E\u221e and it approaches to the experimental value\nwhen N is increased. This shows that the ground energy has been raised after the correction\nof the nuclear motion is considered. One can see from the data in Table 1 and Table 2 that\nit is necessary to consider the relativistic and radiative corrections to the nonrelativistic\nenergy.\nFinally, considering all these contributions, we get the high precision value of the helium\nground energy \u22122.90338 a.u. and the relative error is 0.00034% (the experimental value is\n\u22122.90338629 a.u. [21]).\nIn these calculations, we use a Mathematica software, which is a tool of symbolic calculation. All results are exact except for that of the last step that will bring an error. But\nthis error can be controlled by setting the precision, and we have ensured that it is much\nsmaller than \u2206E. So, the error is mainly derived from the inaccurateness of model, i.e. the\nignorer of the higher orders relativistic and QED effects. We take the error as half of order\n\u03b13 relativistic correction and the estimated theoretical uncertainty of calculation is obtained\nto be \u00b10.00001 a.u..\nIn conclusion, we pointed out that the result of variational calculation of the ground\nstate energy for a helium atom would lower than the experimental value when the nuclear\nmotion is ignored. First, a new variational wave function with a flexible scaling parameter\nkhas been constructed. Then we take account of the nuclear motion and the relativistic and\nradiative corrections to the nonrelativistic ground energy. Using the variational method and\nperturbation method, the high precision value of the helium ground energy is worked out.\nIt is obvious that accuracy will be improved increasing with the number of basis functions\n7\n\n\fN. Thus the ground energy problem of a helium atom is now solved satisfactorily. In our\nlater work, higher orders relativistic and QED effects will be considered to agree with the\nobservational value better.\nThe authors are grateful to Yu-Hong Chen, Yong-Qiang Wang and Zhen-Hua Zhao for\ntheir useful discussions.\n\n[1] Hylleraas E A 1929 Z.
