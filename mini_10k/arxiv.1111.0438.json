Editorials notices - pulsars: individual: Cen X-3 - Stars: neutron - X-rays: binaries\n\n1. Introduction\nCen X-3 was first observed in 1967 (Chodil et al. 1967) and later\nidentified as a pulsating high-mass X-ray binary system based\non the Uhuru observations (Giacconi et al. 1971; Schreier et al.\n1972). The pulsation period of the source was found to be \u223c4.8 s\n(Giacconi et al. 1971), the orbital period (determined from\nregular X-ray eclipses) is \u223c2.08 days (Schreier et al. 1972).\nMeasuring the eclipse times, Avni & Bahcall (1974) derived a\nmass of 0.6\u20131.1 M\u2299 for the compact object and of 16.5\u201318.5 M\u2299\nfor the companion star, well in accordance with Hutchings et al.\n(1979) who determined the masses from the optical spectroscopic observations of the companion. The projected orbital\nradius was determined from the analysis of pulse arrival times\nto be \u223c39.75\u00b10.04 light-seconds (Schreier et al. 1972). The\nsystem is located at a distance of about 8 kpc (Krzeminski\n1974), with a lower limit of 6.2 kpc (Krzeminski 1974). Cen X-3\nshows a non-periodic alternation of high and low states with\na characteristic time of reccurence of 125\u2013165 days, derived\nfrom analysis of Vela data (Priedhorsky & Terrell 1983). This\nlong-term variability is sometimes attributed to a precessing\naccretion disk (Priedhorsky & Terrell 1983).\nOur analysis was triggered by the work of Paul et al. (2005).\nBased on their analysis of RXTE/ASM data of Cen X-3, the authors reported the presence of two distinct spectral states/modes\nin the high state of the source distinguished by the hardness ratio. In the high state the peak flux is up to a factor of 40 larger\nthan during the low state (Paul et al. 2005). It was found that\nwhen the source makes a transition from a low to a high state,\nit adopts one of these two spectral modes and during the entire high-intensity phase remains in that mode. Paul et al. (2005)\nshowed that during all high states between December 2000 and\n\nApril 2004 the source was in the hard spectral mode as indicated by large hardness ratio, while in all high states prior and\nsubsequent to this period it was in the soft spectral mode. To exclude systematic effects the authors analyzed ASM data on three\nother sources: Her X-1, Vela X-1 and SMC X-1. But none of the\nsources showed the behavior similar to that reported for Cen X3. Paul et al. (2005) interpreted their results as a manifestation of\ntwo accretion modes which are at work in Cen X-3 at different\ntimes.\nWe repeated the analysis of Paul et al. (2005) using the same\ndata set and following the analysis procedures described in their\npaper. We then extended our analysis to the entire ASM data on\nthe source available by now and included the data obtained with\nthe MAXI, INTEGRAL/JEM-X and INTEGRAL/ISGRI instruments.\n\n2. Observational data and analysis method\nWe used data from the All Sky Monitor (ASM) onboard the\nRossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), from the Monitor of All\nSky X-ray Image (MAXI) and from the JEM-X and ISGRI\ninstruments of the INTEGRAL (INTErnational Gamma-Ray\nAstrophysics Laboratory) satellite.\nThe ASM instrument is an X-ray monitor covering the\n1.5\u201312 keV energy range (Levine et al. 1996). It consists of\nthree Scanning Shadow Cameras (SSCs) each with a positionsensitive proportional counter (Levine et al. 1996). The counts\ndetected in three energy bands, 1.5\u20133, 3\u20135 and 5\u201312 keV, are accumulated in dwells of about 90 s. In our analysis we used the\nDwell by Dwell data available from the ASM team on the web\n(http://xte.mit.edu/asmlc/ ). We checked that these data differ only\nin format from the data available at the NASA's High Energy\n1\n\n\f3-5 keV 1.5-3 keV\n5-12 keV\n\nASM countrate in band\n\nDaniela M\u00fcller et al.: No apparent accretion mode changes detected in Cen X-3 (RN)\n\n10\n5\n0\n10\n5\n0\n15\n10\n5\n0\n50500\n\n51000\n\n51500\n\n52000\nMJD\n\n52500\n\n53000\n\n53500\n\nFig. 1. The processed ASM lightcurve of Cen X-3 from MJD 50087 to 53501. The three energy bands A (1.5\u20133 keV), B (3\u20135 keV)\nand C (5\u201312 keV) are shown in different panels.\nAstrophysics Science Archive Center (HEASARC) which were\nused by Paul et al. (2005).\nMAXI is an X-ray monitor onboard of the International\nSpace Station (ISS) (Matsuoka et al. 2009). It scans the sky each\norbit of 92 minutes observing a particular source for about 40\u2013\n150 seconds (Sugizaki et al. 2011), depending on the source position. MAXI has two cameras, the Gas Slit Camera (GSC)\nand the Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC). The main instrument,\nGSC, consists of proportional counters with slit and slat collimators (Matsuoka et al. 2009) with a total effective area of\n5350 cm2 (Matsuoka et al. 2009). Every orbit, about 85% of\nthe sky is scanned in the 2\u201330 keV energy band (Sugizaki et al.\n2011). MAXI lightcurves with a time resolution of one orbit are\navailable on the web (http://maxi.riken.jp). The lightcurves are\nproduced for three energy bands, 2\u20134 keV, 4\u201310 keV, and 10\u2013\n20 keV.\nThe INTEGRAL satellite observes objects simultaneously\nin gamma rays, X-rays and visible light. JEM-X is one of its\ninstruments and consists of two telescopes with coded aperture masks (Lund et al. 2003). JEM-X obtains X-ray spectra and\nimaging in the 3\u201335 keV energy band (Lund et al. 2003). IBIS is\nthe gamma-ray imager of INTEGRAL and consists of two detector layers, ISGRI and PICsIT (Ubertini et al. 2003). ISGRI\nis the soft gamma ray imager (Lebrun et al. 2003). It consists\nof a CdTe detector camera with a sensitive area of 2621 cm2\nobserving in the 15 keV\u20131 MeV energy band (Lebrun et al.\n2003). INTEGRAL data can be downloaded from the web\n(http://www.isdc.unige.ch/heavens webapp/integral/ ) for all instruments and for a number of predefined energy bands. For\nour analysis we selected following energy bands: JEM-X 3.0\u2013\n5.5 keV, 5.5\u201310.2 keV, 10.2\u201318.9 keV, 18.9\u201334.9 keV, ISGRI\n22.1\u201330.0 keV, 30.0\u201340.3 keV, 40.3\u201351.2 keV, 51.3\u201363.3 keV.\nAs mentioned above, our analysis follows the procedures\ndescribed in Paul et al. (2005). First, we excluded data falling\nin the intervals of X-ray eclipses. We then averaged the data\n2\n\nwithin each orbit of the system to avoid any spectral dependence\non the orbital phase (Suchy et al. 2008), i.e. we produced light\ncurves with one time bin per orbit. For consistency, we used the\nsame orbital parameters as Paul et al. (2005): the orbital period\nPorb = 2.08702 d, the mid-eclipse time tmid (TJD) = 10087.295,\nand the eclipse duration in units of orbital phase \u2206\u03c6 = 0.306 (including ingress and egress). First, we performed the analysis on\nthe same ASM data set as used in Paul et al. (2005): from MJD\n50087 to 53501. Then, to enlarge the data sample, we added\nASM data on the source covering the time range from MJD\n53501 to 55646 (i.e. all ASM observations available by the time\nof preparation of this work). For the MAXI analysis we used\nall the data available by now, from MJD 55097 to MJD 55630.\nFor the INTEGRAL analysis we used data from MJD 52650 to\n54959 which is all available data in the archive.\n\n3. Results\n3.1. RXTE/ASM results\n\nThe resulting ASM lightcurve of Cen X-3 in the time range MJD\n50087\u201353501 in three energy bands with removed eclipse intervals with each bin corresponding to one orbit of the system\nis shown in Figure 1. In the 5\u201312 keV light curve, one can already see substantial differences with respect to the results of\nPaul et al. (2005) (see Fig. 1 in their paper). The reported spectral hardening accompanied with an increase of the flux between\nMJD 51800 and 53100 in the highest energy band could not\nbe confirmed in our analysis. The reported two spectral states\nshould emerge as two branches of data points in a plot of the\ncountrates in the 3\u20135 keV band versus the 5\u201312 keV band, as\nshown in Figure 3 of Paul et al. (2005). In the corresponding plot\nresulted from our (re-)analysis of the data (Fig. 2), we could not\nfind any hint of different branches.\nThe inclusion of the new ASM data that became available\nsince the work of Paul et al. (2005) (MJD 53501 to 55646) also\ndid not reveal any separation of the data points in two spectral\n\n\fDaniela M\u00fcller et al.: No apparent accretion mode changes detected in Cen X-3 (RN)\n\nthose energy bands are closest to the bands \"B\" and \"C\" of ASM\nwhere the most clear separation in two spectral states is seen in\nPaul et al.

(2005), the\nseparation of the two spectral states should appear best in a 3.0\u2013\n5.5 keV versus 5.5\u201310.2 keV countrate plot of JEM-X. As for the\nMAXI data we could not find the presence of two spectral states\n(see Fig. 6). Extending the energy bands up to higher energies,\ne.g. using ISGRI data, did not reveal any spectral separation of\nthe source as well.\n3\n\n\fDaniela M\u00fcller et al.: No apparent accretion mode changes detected in Cen X-3 (RN)\n\nReferences\n\n40\n\ncountrate in 3.0-5.5 keV band\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n30\n40\ncountrate in 5.5-10.2 keV band\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFig. 6.

Conclusions\nTriggered by the finding of Paul et al. (2005), we performed a\nstudy of Cen X-3 using the data taken with two all sky monitors, RXTE/ASM and the MAXI as well as data taken from the\nJEM-X and ISGRI instruments of INTEGRAL. Using the same\ndata and analysis procedures as Paul et al. (2005), we could not\nfind any spectral transitions either in the lightcurve or by plotting fluxes in different energy bands versus each other. The result\ndoes not change with addition of newest RXTE/ASM, MAXI or\nINTEGRAL data or by extending the analysis up to higher energy bands. Although Paul et al. (2005) ruled out possible instrumental effects on the basis of their analysis of the ASM data of\nsome other sources for the same time interval as for Cen X-3, we\nsuggest that systematic and/or analysis effects are responsible for\nthe previously reported appearance of the two spectral states. To\nclarify this issue we have contacted the ASM instrument team inquiring whether any substantial recalibration of ASM data took\nplace after the work of Paul et al. (2005). According to them,\nmajor calibrational changes occurred around MJD 51956 when\ntelemetry modes switched from ASM \"Position Histogram\" to\nASM Event mode. ASM camera SSC 1 was mainly influenced\nby this change and a discontinuity around that time might have\nled to a change in the observed fluxes as reported in Paul et al.\n(2005). However, the spectral discontinuity was seen in each\nASM camera separately for Cen X-3, but not seen at all for a\nset of other pulsars. Additionally, the data software ran through\nmajor updates in April 2005 and 2007. This could have also led\nto the reported behavior if the data for Her X-1, Vela X-1, and\nSMC X-1 used by Paul et al. (2005) to check for possible instrumental effects were downloaded after the software update. The\ninstrument team also generally claimed that although it is now\ndifficult to check if the recalibration or data analysis software\nupdates could lead to the reported effect, the regular improvement of the ASM calibration over time suggests that any later\nanalysis is generally more reliable as the earlier one.\nAcknowledgements.
