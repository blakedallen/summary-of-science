Binder [1]. The equilibrium formation/dissolution of droplets in finite systems is discussed in the context of the canonical and\nthe grand canonical distributions.\nKey words: phase coexistence, phase transitions, Ising model, finite-size effects, droplets\nPACS: 05.50, 64.10.+h, 64.70.F, 64.60.Q\n\nIn the last few years, a considerable number of computer experiments, for instance\n[9,10,11,13,14], carefully performed on systems exhibiting phase coexistence have\nunderscored the need for a better understanding of the droplet formation/dissolution\nphenomena. In this context, some early analyses [3,15,6] pointed to the existence\nof a volume dependent (mesoscopic) scale at which droplets first appear. (Specifically, it was argued that in a system of volume Ld , one does not observe droplets\nbelow the linear scale of Ld/(d+1) .) Recently, a detailed quantitative description of\nthe actual droplet formation/dissolution in closed equilibrium systems has been\naccomplished [12,2]. For instance, the following was shown in [2] regarding a gasliquid system in volume Ld and the number of particles fixed to a value exceeding\nthat of the ambient gas by amount \u03b4N:\n(1) There is a dimensionless parameter \u2206 proportional to (\u03b4N)(d+1)/d /Ld and a\ncritical value \u2206c = \u2206c (d), such that no droplet forms for \u2206 < \u2206c , while there\nis a single droplet of liquid phase when \u2206 > \u2206c .\n(2) The fraction \u03bb\u2206 \u2208 [0, 1] of the excess particles subsumed by the droplet depends on \u2206 via a universal equation which depends only on dimension (and\nwhich is otherwise independent of the details of the system).\n\u2020\n\ncorresponding author; address: UCLA Mathematics Department, Box 951555, Los Angeles, CA\n90095-1555; email: biskup@math.ucla.edu\nc Copyright rests with the authors.

Binder [1] wherein the existence of the\nmesoscopic scale for droplet formation/dissolution was re-derived by phenomenological arguments. Two additional conclusions of interest were reached in [1]:\n(4) A signature discontinuity in the intensive variable relative to the setup at hand,\nthat is, the magnetic field in a spin system and the chemical potential in a\nliquid/gas system.\n(5) The scaling window for the \"rounding\" of this discontinuity in finite systems.\nWhile we are somewhat uneasy about the derivation of (5)-which in our opinion\npoorly accounts for the possible influence of lower order corrections-we will focus our attention on conclusion (4). The substance of this conclusion is apparently\nnovel and warrants further investigations, particularly because of the purported connection with other \"unconventional\" phase transitions, see reference 35 of [1]. We\nwill concentrate on the Ising ferromagnet in a d-dimensional volume Ld . Although\nthe magnetic language is used in [1], the lattice-gas interpretation is invoked to label the ensembles: The constrained ensemble with fixed total spin (i.e., fixed magnetization) will be referred to as the \"canonical\" ensemble, whereas the \"grand\ncanonical\" ensemble will denote the usual distribution in which the magnetization\nis allowed to fluctuate.\nInherently in its nature, the magnetic field is a quantity associated with (and\nadjustable only in the context of) the \"grand canonical\" ensemble. This leads us to\nour first question: How does the purported discontinuity reflect itself in the \"grand\ncanonical\" ensemble? To address this issue, let us investigate the problem of the\nIsing magnet in a box of linear dimension L, at the temperature T < Tc , external\nfield h and plus boundary conditions. The cases of interest are h \u2264 0 with |h| \u226a 1,\nwhich are the only conditions under which the system might nucleate a droplet.\nDenoting by R the linear scale of the purported droplet, the magnetic gain from\nits formation would be of the order of hRd , while the surface cost would scale\nas Rd\u22121 . Obviously, the two costs balance out for R \u223c 1/|h|, so if L & R permits R\nto exceed a constant times 1/|h|, such a droplet will form and otherwise it won't.\nThis, of course, is exactly the basis for classical nucleation theory.\nNotwithstanding any doubts as to the validity of the above reasoning, the preceding setup has been the subject matter of some rigorous analysis, see [16,17,7,8]. In\nparticular, the following two-dimensional result was established in [17]: Consider\nthe setup as described (with plus boundary conditions and h < 0), with |h| \u2192 0\nand L \u2192 \u221e in such a way that |h|L tends to a definite limit, denoted by B. Then\nthere is a B0 > 0 (which can be calculated in terms of system characteristics), such\n\n2\n\n\fthat the following holds:\n\u2022 If B < B0 , there are no droplets and the entire box is in the plus phase.\n\u2022 If B > B0 , a large droplet of minus phase fills most of the box leaving only a\nsmall fraction of the plus phase in the corners.\nThus, whenever the droplet forms, it subsumes the bulk of the system. Similar (albeit weaker) theorems were proved in [7,8] for all d > 2.\nThese results are of direct relevance and lead to the following inescapable conclusion: In the context of the \"grand canonical\" distribution, there is no window of\nopportunity for the formation of a mesoscopic droplet. Explicitly, whenever conditions permit the existence of a \"droplet\" in the system, it occurs on the macroscopic\nscale. Ostensibly, one might still hope for the occurrence of some signature event\nwhen the magnetic field lies in (or in the vicinity of) Binder's gap. However, this is\nnot the case: Binder has calculated the edges of the forbidden region,\n(1)\n\nHt\n\n= (d + 1)\n\nSd\nmcoex (T ) \u2212 d\u22121\nVd d+1\n\u03c7coex (T )\n2d\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nand\n\nd\nd+1\n\n\u0012\n\nL\n\u03becoex (T )\n\n\u0013\u2212\n\nd\n\nd\nd+1\n\nd\n\nc d+1\n\nd\n\n\u2212 d+1\nd\nmcoex (T ) \u2212 d\u22121\nL\nSd d+1\n= (d \u2212 1)\nc d+1 ,\nVd d+1\n\u03c7coex (T )\n2d\n\u03becoex (T )\nwhere Vd , Sd and d are geometrical constants, mcoex (T ), \u03c7coex (T ) and \u03becoex (T ) is\nnotation for the magnetization, susceptibility and the correlation length, respectively, and c = fs (T )\u03c7coex (T )mcoex (T )\u22122 \u03becoex (T )\u22121 -with fs (T ) denoting the surface tension-is a dimensionless ratio (canceling out the superfluous \u03becoex (T )'s!)\nwhich presumably tends to a constant as T \u2192 Tc . But, at the end of the day, both\n(i)\nedges satisfy Ht \u223c L\u2212d/(d+1) , which, we emphasize, is deep inside the droplet\ndominated regime.\n\n\u0012\n\n(2)\nHt\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nOn the basis of the above deposition, it appears that conclusion (4) has absolutely\nno bearing on finite-volume systems described by the \"grand canonical\" ensemble.\nThe question is then: How to interpret the magnetic field and its purported discontinuity otherwise? As is clear from the outset, some non-standard interpretation will\nbe necessary since the only physical framework in which the phenomenon occurs\nis the \"canonical\" ensemble. In the context of the Ising model in volume Ld and\nplus boundary conditions, the latter describes the constrained distribution where\nthe overall magnetization ML is restricted to a single value. (Here, as goes without\nsaying, the external field h in the Hamiltonian simply drops out of the problem.)\nTo achieve a droplet of minus phase, there has to be a deficit in the magnetization\naway from the preferred value of ML . In such circumstances, the general results\ndiscussed in the introductory paragraph imply the existence of a sharp constant \u0398c\n2\n(related to \u2206c ) such that no droplet will be created for deficits less than \u0398c Ld /(d+1) ,\n2\nwhile, for deficits larger than \u0398c Ld /(d+1) , a non-trivial fraction of the deficit will\ncondense into a droplet.\nLet us now attempt to elucidate how a magnetic field could have arisen in the\nderivations of [1]. Of course, in the \"canonical\" ensemble, we are always entitled\n3\n\n\fto calculate the (finite-volume) free energy as a function of the magnetization. As\nis necessarily implied by the nature of the above droplet formation/dissolution phenomenon, this function has two branches depending on what type of configurations\nbring the decisive contributions:\n2\n\n\u2022 For magnetizations with a deficit less than \u0398c Ld /(d+1) , configurations with\nno mesoscopic droplets.\n2\n\u2022 For magnetizations with a deficit in excess of \u0398c Ld /(d+1) , configurations with\na single appropriately-sized droplet.\nIt is not much of a surprise that a cusp will form at the point where the two branches\n(2)\n(1)\ncome together. It appears that the values Ht and Ht , which are enunciated explicitly in [1], are just the one-sided derivatives of the free energy-with respect to\nmagnetization-at this cusp.\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nUnfortunately, the physical significance attributed to the values Ht , Ht , their\ndifference and their ratio in [1] is perhaps a bit overplayed. Indeed, following the\ndogma of bulk thermodynamics, the \"H\" is proclaimed to be the natural canonical conjugate of the magnetization and, as such, it is deemed to be the appropriate\nmeasure of the response of the system to the change of the magnetization. However, here we deal with a system exhibiting mesoscopic phenomena and, more importantly, inhomogeneities. In such systems the meaning of a conjugate variable is\nrather murky because the standard interpretations of the thermodynamic potentials\nare only clear in the thermodynamic limit, under the auspices of the equivalence of\nensembles. Consequently, for the system at hand, the primary response functions\nshould be the \"H's\" associated with the parts of the system outside and inside the\ndroplet, which we note are perfectly analytic functions of the corresponding magnetizations. On the basis of the latter response functions, and the knowledge of the\ndroplet size, the overall \"H\" considered in conclusion (4) can immediately be reconstructed. But, even if this quantity could be conveniently accessible numerically,\nits actual meaning is at best secondary.\nWe would like to remark that, in our opinion, the probabilistic language of largedeviation theory provides some additional and worthwhile perspectives in these\nsituations. In the terminology of large-deviation theory, the actual free energy can\nbe conveniently expressed as an infimum of a simple function over what seems to\nbe the natural parameter here: The fraction of the deficit absorbed by the droplet.\nWith this parametrization, the relevant calculations of [1], including the jump in\nthe derivative at the formation point, fit on the back of the proverbial envelope. We\nrefer to [2,4,12] for more details but we do not wish to overstate our case.\n\nConclusions\nThe conclusion/moral is self-evident. In general, given a function, we are always\nentitled to take its Legendre transform and express it in terms of the conjugate\nvariables. In the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics, these transforms are\n4\n\n\finvaluable because the equivalence of ensembles allows for the uninhibited twoway flow of information. For instance, if a particle system is studied at a fixed\ndensity then, except at points of phase transitions, we know everything about the\nfluctuating ensemble with the chemical potential adjusted to produce this density.\nEven more interesting-and even more useful-are the points of thermodynamic\ndiscontinuities. If one ensemble has a forbidden gap (say the particle density in\nthe grand canonical distribution), then forcing the \"parameter value\" into the gap is\nessentially guaranteed to have interesting consequences in the other ensemble (e.g.,\nphase separation).\nBut, the equivalence of ensembles is a mathematical-not to mention physical-\nfact only in the thermodynamic limit. In finite volume, as the droplet formation/dissolution phenomenon dramatically illustrates, the various ensembles are not equivalent. In these contexts, the assignment of physical-not to mention mathematical-significance to the conjugate variables is of dubious value. We suspect that\nthis is the generic situation when \"phase transitions\" on a mesoscopic scale are the\nobject of study. We believe that the dramatic inequivalence of ensembles in finite\nvolume is the signature of interesting phenomena taking place below the macroscopic scale.\nIt is worth pointing out that, in the present context, the natural thermodynamic\nquantity which exhibits the signature jump is the good old energy density. There\nare several advantages to the use of this quantity as opposed to e.g. the magnetic\nfield considered in [1]. To list a couple, first, there is no numerical difficulty in the\ndynamical construction of the energy histogram and, second, there is no theoretical dispute in the interpretation of this quantity. Some previous efforts to exhibit\nthe behavior of the energy density can be found in [14,13,12]; but, here we emphasize that the actual energy should be measured directly. Notwithstanding, if the\nphysics of interest concerns droplets, it appears most natural to look for the droplet\nitself.
