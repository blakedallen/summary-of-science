The Tevatron\nhas recently completed major upgrades to achieve higher\nenergy (990 GeV per beam) and instantaneous luminosity (1032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 ). CDF has been upgraded to CDFII to cope with the higher interaction rate as well as to\nextend its physics reach in this new and more difficult\nenvironment[1].\nThe CDF upgrades relevant for this paper are the tracker\nand the trigger. The tracker is composed of the Central\nDrift Chamber (COT) and three independent silicon detectors (Layer00, Silicon Vertex Detector and Intermediate\n\u2217 corresponding\n\nauthor\n\nSilicon Layers detector). The Layer00 is made of one layer\nof radiation hard silicon microstrips (with r \u2212 \u03c6 readout)\nplaced just outside of the beam pipe (r = 1.5 cm). The\nnew Silicon Vertex Detector (SVXII) [2, 3] is made of five\ndouble-sided (with r \u2212 \u03c6 and r \u2212 z readout) microstrip\nsensors arranged in a 12-fold azimuthal geometry and segmented in 6 longitudinal barrels (3 mechanical units, each\nread out at both ends) along the beam line (CDF z-axis).\nThe silicon layers are posed between 2.5 and 10.6 cm from\nthe beamline. With the length of about 1 meter the SVXII\ncovers 2 units in pseudorapidity. The ISL is located between the SVXII and the COT with one central layer at\n23 cm from the beamline and two forward/backward layers\nrespectively at 20 and 29 cm from the beamline. The COT\nis a multilayer drift chamber which covers the region between 46 cm and 131 cm from the beamline. It provides a\nhigh resolution measurement of the curvature and azimutal\nangle of the charged tracks.\nThe CDF trigger has been completely rebuilt and it consists of three levels. Its challenging task is to reduce the\n5 MHz rate input to level 1 to the 50 Hz allowed as maximum output rate from level 3 which is written directly to\ntape. Levels 1 and 2 are implemented in hardware while\nlevel 3 is an executable running on a PC farm. The level\n1 device most relevant to this paper is the eXtremely Fast\nTrack finder processor (XFT) [4] which reconstructs 2-D\ntracks (in the r \u2212 \u03c6 plane, transverse to the beam line) in\nthe central drift chamber (COT). The Online Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) is part of the level 2 trigger. It receives\nthe list of COT tracks reconstructed by the XFT processor (for each track the curvature c and azimutal angle \u03c6\n\n\fare measured) and the digitized pulse heights on the silicon\nlayers (\u223c 105 channels). The SVT links the XFT tracks\nto the silicon hits and reconstructs tracks with offline-like\nquality. From simulation of the tracking algorithm on run I\ndata the expected resolution of the SVT is \u03b4\u03c6 \u2243 1 mrad,\n\u03b4Pt \u2243 0.003 * Pt 2 GeV/c, \u03b4d \u2243 35 \u03bcm (d is the track impact parameter, i.e. the distance of closest approach of the\nparticle trajectory elix to the z-axis of the CDF reference\nsystem).\nBy providing a precision measurement of the impact parameter of charged particle tracks SVT allows triggering\non events containing long lived particles. B hadrons in particular have a decay lenght of the order of 500 micron and\ntracks which come out of the B decay vertices have an impact parameter on average greater than 100 micron. The\nopportunity offered by the SVT of triggering directly on\nB hadron decay vertices is available for the first time at\na hadron collider. It greatly improves the capability of selecting online B events which was tightly bound to leptonic\ndecay modes in the past. Given the very large cross section\nfor producing B hadrons of the Tevatron (100 microbarn),\nCDF-II expects to have access even to rare purely hadronic\nB decays like B \u25e6 \u2192 \u03c0\u03c0 and Bs \u2192 Ds \u03c0 \u2192 hadrons, which\nare extremely interesting respectively for CP violation and\nBs mixing measurements.\n\n2\n\nSVT WORKING PRINCIPLE\n\nThe SVT has a very short time to keep up with the 50 KHz\nlevel 1 accept rate and to perform its task (on average about\n20 \u03bcs per event). For this reason the whole SVT design has\nbeen concentrated on speeding up operations. The SVT\nhas a widely parallelized design: it is made of 12 identical azimuthal slices (\"wedges\") working in parallel. Each\nwedge receives and processes data from only one SVXII\n30\u25e6 wedge. In addition the SVT reconstructs only tracks\nin the transverse plane to the beamline (stereo info from\nSVXII is dropped) and only with pt above 2 GeV/c.\nThe tracking process is performed in two steps:\n\u2022 Pattern recognition: candidate tracks are searched\namong a list of precalculated low resolution patterns\n(\"roads\");\n\u2022 Track fitting: a full resolution fit of the hit coordinates\nfound within each road is performed using a linearized\nalgorithm;\nThe pattern recognition step is performed in a completely parallel way by the Associative Memory system\nwhich uses full custom VLSI chips (AMchips [5]). The\nAM system compares all the silicon clusters and XFT\ntracks with the set of precalculated patterns. A pattern is\ndefined as a combination of five bins (\"SuperStrips\"): four\nSuperStrips correspond to the position coordinates of the\nparticle trajectory on four silicon layers, which can be chosen among the five SVXII layers and Layer00, the fifth SuperStrip corresponds to the azimuthal angle of the particle\n\ntrajectory at a distance of 12 cm from the beam line. The\noutput of AM system is the list of patterns (\"roads\") for\nwhich at least one hit has been found on each SuperStrip.\nEach SVT wedge uses 32K patterns which cover more than\n95% of the phase space for pt \u2265 2 GeV/c. Simulation\nstudies have shown that SVT performance is optimized (in\nterms of processing time and final resolution) by choosing\na SuperStrip size of about 250 micron on the silicon layers\nand 5\u25e6 for the \u03c6 angle measured by XFT.\nThe track fitting method is based on linear approximations and principal component analysis [6]. The analytical\nrelationship between the track parameters and the six measured hit coordinates (hit positions on four silicon layers,\ncurvature, and azimuthal angle of XFT track) can be expressed in terms of six equations:\nPj = Pj (x) = Fj * x + Qj\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x is the vector of hit coordinates and P = (d,c, \u03c6, \u03c71 ,\n\u03c72 , \u03c73 ) are respectively the impact parameter (d), the curvature (c) and the azimuthal angle (\u03c6) at the point of minimum approach to the z-axis, while \u03c71 , \u03c72 and \u03c73 are three\nindependent constraints which all real tracks must satisfy\n(within detector resolution effects). Fj and Qj are constants which depend only on the detector geometry and the\nmagnetic field.\nAfter pattern recognition has been performed each track\ncandidate is confined within one road and this information\ncan be used to simplify the computation of equation 1. The\nhit coordinates and track parameters are given by the sum\nof a term which depends only on the SuperStrip edge (x0 )\nand an additional term (\u03b4x) which depends on the posistion\nof the hits within the SuperStrips. Equation 1 becomes:\nP0j + \u03b4Pj = Fj * (x0 + \u03b4x) + Qj\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, P0j = Fj * x0 + Qj is a constant which depends on\nthe single road, while \u03b4Pj is the correction which depends\non the precise hit positions inside the road. The P0j coefficients are calculated offline, stored in RAMs and used\non a track-by-track basis. Therefore the track fitting task\nreduces to the fast computation of simple scalar products\n(done by FPGA chips)\n\u03b4Pj = Fj * \u03b4x.\n\n(3)\n\nwhich determine the small correction to add to the road\ndependent constant terms. The SVT output is the list of\nhigh precision tracks which is sent to the trigger processors\nfor the final level 2 trigger decision.\nSVT is made by over one hundred VME boards housed\nin eight crates [7]. The installation has been completed and\nthe system has been fully operational since the beginning\nof 2001. In the following section we report on the performance achieved by the system in the early phase (AprilOctober 2001) of run II.\n\n\f3 SVT PERFORMANCE\n\n0.6\n\nThe correlation of the impact parameter d versus the azimuthal angle \u03c6 of candidate tracks (Figure 1 (top)) is the\nfirst evidence that the SVT tracks are good. The plot shows\nthe typical sine wave shape which is due to the fact that\nthe position of the interaction vertex in the transverse plane\n(x0 , y0 ) is displaced from the origin of CDF reference system. In this case the relationship between d and \u03c6 for primary tracks is:\n\n0.4\n\nd = \u2212x0 sin(\u03c6) + y0 cos(\u03c6).\n\n(4)\n\nA fit to the d \u2212 \u03c6 scatter plot provides a measure of the (x0 ,\ny0 ) coordinates with an accuracy of few microns.\nA beam displacement of few millimiters is a typical running condition for CDF. In principle this condition could\nbe a problem because it generates unphysical large impact\nparameters which are erroneously interpreted by the level\n2 trigger as the presence of B decays. In practice this potential problem is avoided by having a process running on\nthe SVT VME crate controller and performing a fit of the\nd \u2212 \u03c6 correlation to determine the beam offset. The beam\nposition parameters are transferred to the SVT which subtractes the beam offset internally (Figure 1 (bottom)). To\nremove possible additional misalignments among SVXII\nbarrels, this is done independently for tracks in each of the\nsix SVXII z-barrels. Following this procedure the level 2\ntrigger receives physical impact parameters (i.e. measured\nwith respect to the actual beam position). Figure 2 shows\nthe impact parameter distribution after correcting for the\nbeam offset. This distribution is given by the convolution\nof the actual transverse beam profile with the intrinsic impact parameter resolution. A gaussian fit gives \u03c3 \u2243 69 micron.\nA big effort has been put in understanding the various factors which contribute to the SVT impact parameter resolution. The goal is to improve it as much as possible, because the worse is the resolution the higher is the\nrate of the triggers based on impact parameter cuts. The\npotentially most relevant contribution to the d resolution\narises from the z-misalignment between the detector and\nthe beam. The effect of a z-misalignment (mx = \u03b4x/\u03b4z,\nmy = \u03b4y/\u03b4z) shows up as a residual modulation in the impact parameter d \u2212 \u03c6 correlation obtained after correcting\nfor the beam offset:\nd\u2032 = \u2212mx z0 sin(\u03c6) + my z0 cos(\u03c6)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere z0 is the z-coordinate of the point of closest approach of the particle trajectory to the z-axis. Unfortunately z0 is not measured by the SVT, which receives the\nonly z information from the SVXII segmentation into six\nbarrels, therefore the beam tilt results in an irreducible\nwidening of the d distribution. In order to make this spread\nsmall compared to the natural beam width, SVT requires\nthe detector and the beam to be parallel within 100 \u03bcrad.\nAssembly of the SVXII barrels indeed met this specification [3], The alignement of the beam orbit turned out to\n\n0.2\n0\n-0.2\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-0.1\n-0.2\n-0.3\n-0.4\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nFigure 1: d\u2212\u03c6 correlation for SVT track candidates before\n(top) and after correcting for beam offset (bottom). The\naverage beam position in the transverse plane is measured\nwith a fit to the top plot (x0 =0.0995 cm and y0 =-0.3895 cm)\nwith a precision of \u2243 3 micron. The regions without points\naround \u03c6=2.2 and \u03c6=4.2 rad are due to SVXII wedges\nwhich were turned off when the data analysed in this paper were taken. The scale on the x axis is radians, the scale\non the y axis is cm.\n\nbe more challenging. During the April-October data taking period, the beam slope was significantly large: mx \u2243\n600 \u03bcrad, my \u2243 150 \u03bcrad, well beyond the SVT specification. The effect of the z-misalignment on the impact\nparameter distribution was estimated using a special run\ntaken with an approximately null beam tilt. In this case\nthe d distribution had \u03c3 \u2243 59 micron, which is 10 micron\nsmaller than the width found for the runs taken with significant beam tilt. Work is in progress in order to have a good\nalignment as the standard running condition.\nThere are two additional major contributions affecting\nthe impact parameter resolution. The first is the relative\nmisalignment among SVXII wedges. This contribution can\nbe easily corrected by performing the beam position fit and\nthe corresponding impact parameter beam offset subtraction independently in each wedge. The size of this correction to the resolution is approximately 6 micron. The\nsecond contribution to the impact parameter resolution is a\nconsequence of the linear approximation of the SVT track\nfitting method, which assumes a first order expansion centered at the beam position. Since during the April-October\ndata taking the beam was very far from its nominal position (\u2243 4 mm away) the effect of non linearity was significant: it reduced the impact parameter resolution by approximately 5 micron. This effect can be corrected by re-\n\n\f1200\n\nsimulations.\n\n4\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n-0.1\n\n-0.075 -0.05 -0.025\n\n0\n\n0.025\n\n0.05\n\n0.075\n\n0.1\n\nFigure 2: Impact parameter distribution (scale is cm) after\ncorrecting for the beam offset.\n\ncalculating the constants used in equation 2 centering the\nexpansion on the measured beam position. After applying all these corrections the impact parameter distribution\nwas found to have a gaussian shape with a sigma of 48\nmicron for a run taken with the beam aligned in z 1 .All\nthese corrections can be easily implemented in the SVT by\nmodifying the constans loaded on the boards. They will be\nimplemented in the next data taking after the October shutdown. The only ingredient out of the SVT control is the\nbeam alignment along z.\nAs anticipated the impact parameter distribution is the\nconvolution of the actual transverse beam profile with the\nintrinsic impact parameter resolution. By using equation 4\nit can be shown that the covariance of the impact parameters of two tracks originating from the same vertex is proportional to the cosine of the opening angle between the\ntwo tracks:\n2\n* cos(\u2206\u03c6)\n\u03c3d1 d2 =< d1 * d2 >= \u03c3B\n\n(6)\n\nwhere the constant \u03c3B is the width of the actual transverse\nbeam profile. By using this relation and October 2001 data\nit has been possible to measure the beam width (33 micron)\nand consequently determine the intrinsic impact parameter\nresolution of the SVT (35 micron) by subtracting in quadrature \u03c3B from the impact parameter distribution width (48\nmicron). The estimate for the SVT impact parameter resolution is well in agreement with early SVT performance\n1 There are additional effects: a residual non linearity in d and \u03c6, and\nthe misalignement of silicon layers within a wedge. The correction for\nthese effects is less straightforward because it requires reprogramming\nsome SVT boards and adjusting the detector geometry of the SVT maps.\nThe effect of these additional correction has been studied with the simulation and reduces the the width of d distribution to 45 micron.\n\nPHYSICS PROSPECTS WITH THE SVT\n\nCDF has designed a trigger strategy (\"hadronic B trigger\")\nbased only on tracking to select hadronic B decays interesting for CP violation and Bs mixing. The idea is to select\ncharmless decays (B0d \u2192 h+ h\u2212 ) for CP violation and a\ncollection of charmed decays (B0s \u2192 Ds\u2212 \u03c0 + and B0s \u2192\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2217\u25e6 \u2212\nDs\u2212 \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 + with the D\u2212\ns \u2192 \u03c6\u03c0 and Ds \u2192 K K )\nfor mixing. This trigger strategy relies on XFT tracks at\nlevel 1 and SVT tracks at level 2. The most important ingredient are the level 2 impact parameter cuts which reduce\nthe trigger rate by three orders of magnitude. For the success of this trigger strategy the SVT performance is essential.\nIn October 2001 CDF took the first test runs which implemented a simplified version of the hadronic B trigger.\nThe level 1 required two opposite charge XFT tracks with\npt > 2 GeV/c, pt1 + pt2 > 5.5 GeV/c and an opening angle smaller than 135\u25e6 . The level 2 required two good SVT\ntracks with pt > 2 GeV/c (no impact parameter threshold was set for these preliminary test runs). Using this\ndata (\u2243 15 nb\u22121 ) and a very simple selection based on decay length cuts, a small signal of D\u25e6 \u2192 K\u03c0 was reconstructed [6] (Figure 2). Although this is not a fully reconstructed hadronic B signal yet, it shows that the purity of\nthe triggered sample allows extracting some heavy flavour\nsignal even from a very small sample (15 nb\u22121 ). As data\ntaking proceeds we expect to perform more sophisticated\nanalysis and to isolate the first hadronic B signals. With\nthe 2 fb\u22121 of data CDF-II plans to collect in run II we expect to contribute significantly to the field of CP violation\nin B decays and Bs mixing.\n\n5 CONCLUSIONS\nThe Online Silicon Vertex Tracker is the new level 2 trigger\nprocessor dedicated to the reconstruction of tracks within\nthe tracking chamber and the silicon vertex detector of the\nCDF-II experiment. The SVT has been successfully installed and operated during the preliminary phase of run\nII. The performance of the device has already shown to\nbe very close to the design. The impact parameter resolution is as good as needed for a successful operation of the\ntrigger provided that the tilt between the beam and the detector is not larger than 100 microradiants. CDF relies on\nSVT tracks for trigger strategies dedicated to the selection\nof hadronic B decays. Preliminary test runs implementing these strategies have been taken in October 2001 and\nthe first signals of heavy flavours have been found. Improvements of the SVT performance are expected in the\nnear future as the operating conditions will evolve from\nthe commissioning to a more stable phase. Pedestal adjustments, dead channels suppressions and a better tuning\nof the clustering algorithm are expected. Fine tuning of the\nSVT (corrections for non-linearities and relative wedge-to-\n\n\fwedge misalignments) will soon be implemented.\n\n6\n\nREFERENCES\n\n[1] J.
