The extension of solid-state entanglement from two to several qubits is a new milestone within reach of existing\ntechnology. Tripartite interactions between two phase\nqubits and a resonant cavity in cQED were recently\ndemonstrated19 , suggesting a deterministic but unverified production of W-class tripartite entanglement20 .\nHere, we demonstrate the extension of conditionalphase gates13 (C-Phase) and joint qubit readout15,21 in\ncQED to the generation and detection of more stringent\nGHZ-class entanglement between three superconducting\ncharge qubits. Independently, entanglement between\nthree phase qubits has been created and detected at\nUCSB, and is reported in a simultaneous publication22 .\nOur superconducting chip (Fig. 1a) consists of four\ntransmon qubits23,24 (labeled Q1 to Q4 counter-clockwise\nfrom top right) inside a transmission-line cavity that\ncouples them25 , isolates them from the electromagnetic\nenvironment26 , and allows their joint readout15,21,27 .\nAs in the two-qubit predecessor13,15 , qubit control is\nachieved with a combination of resonant microwave\ndrives realizing single-qubit x- and y-rotations, and\nflux pulses individually tuning the qubit transition frequencies on nanosecond timescales. Flux pulses inducing small frequency excursions (. 100 MHz) realize zrotations. Stronger pulses (\u223c 650 MHz excursions) drive\nspecific computational levels into resonance with noncomputational ones (involving second-excited states of\nQ2 and Q3 ) to realize C-Phase gates between nearest\nneighbors in frequency28 . The readout exploits qubitstate-dependent cavity transmission to gain direct access to multi-qubit correlations, facilitating full tomography of the qubit register and entanglement witnessing. We emphasize that doubling the number of coupled\nqubits has been achieved without significantly increasing\nthe complexity of circuit design, sample fabrication, or\nexperimental calibration, demonstrating the power of a\nquantum bus architecture.\nThe spectrum of single excitations of the three employed qubits (Q1 to Q3 ) and the cavity reveals key\nfeatures of the generalized Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian and allows extraction of its parameters (see Methods). Spectroscopy as a function of local flux tuning\nof Q1 (Fig. 1b) shows exactly three avoided crossings:\nJ-crossings25 with Q2 and with Q3 , and the vacuumRabi splitting17 with the cavity near its bare frequency\nfc = 9.070 GHz. To the resolution of all spectroscopy\nperformed, the spectrum is free of spurious avoided crossings. This is a critical requirement for pulsed excursions of qubit transition frequencies. We choose point I\n[(f1 , f2 , f3 ) = (6.000, 7.000, 8.000) GHz \u00b1 2 MHz] for\nall single-qubit rotations and for readout. Here, the\nqubits are sufficiently detuned from their nearest neighbors in frequency to make their interaction small, yet\nclose enough to the cavity to reach the strong-dispersive\nregime of cQED29,30 .\nTwo-qubit C-Phase gates are the workhorses that generate entanglement in the qubit register.

This crossing (and its |111i \u2194\n|102i analog in the three-excitation manifold) is the primitive\nfor a C-Phase gate between Q2 and Q3 (see Ref. 28). The\ngate is realized with a sudden flux pulse into III. While the\npulse is on, the quantum amplitude initially in |011i is coherently exchanged with |002i. The pulse is turned off after one\nfull period, at which time all quantum amplitude returns to\n|011i, but with an additional phase of \u03c0. Inset, Time-domain\ncharacterization of the avoided crossing using the sequence\noutlined by arrows in main panel. Starting from |000i, simultaneous \u03c0 pulses on Q2 and Q3 populate |011i. A V2 pulse of\nduration \u03c4 is next applied. Simultaneous \u03c0-pulses then transfer the final quantum amplitude in |011i to |000i to maximize\nreadout contrast. This characterization gives a calibration of\nthe optimal flux-pulse duration, in this case 12 ns.\n\nPhase gates by direct extension of the protocol proposed\nfor phase qubits in Ref. 28, wherein a full coherent oscillation between computational and non-computational\nstates yields a two-qubit phase of \u03c0. The primitive interaction for C-Phase between Q2 and Q3 is shown with twotone spectroscopy and time-domain data in Fig. 2. (See\nSupplementary Fig. S1 for a similar characterization of\nthe primitive for C-Phase between Q1 and Q2 ). At point\nIII, the computational level |011i becomes resonant with\nthe non-computational level |002i (|abci denotes excitation level a on Q1 , b on Q2 and c on Q3 ). The cavitymediated interaction between these levels produces an\navoided crossing of 86 MHz. An analogous avoided crossing takes places simultaneously in the three-excitation\nmanifold, between |111i and |102i.

To complete the C-Phase gate, the singlequbit dynamical phase acquired by Q2 during the flux\npulse (and also by Q1 and Q3 through residual flux crosstalk) is canceled using a z-rotation (see Supplementary\nFig. S3).\nTo detect the entanglement produced with C-Phase\ngates, we employ a high-fidelity three-qubit joint readout\npresented in a parallel publication27 . This readout allows\nan approximately ten-fold increase in single-shot fidelity\nover the previous two-qubit joint readout13,15,21 without\nrequiring any additional hardware or design modification.\nReadout was previously performed by a pulsed measurement of VH in linear response (\u223c 1 photon in cavity).\nHere, we drive the cavity at fc with 50,000 times lar-\n\nger incident power, well past the onset (\u223c 10 photons)\nof the non-linearity that the cavity inherits via dispersive coupling to the qubits. Turning on this strong drive\ncan make the cavity excite, conditioned on the threequbit state, into a high-transmission state where it regains linearity. We adjust the incident power so that\nthe cavity excites for all register states except |000i.\nIf this selectivity were perfect, the measurement would\nbe projective\non |000i, making the ensemble average\nP\nhVH i \u221d A,B,C\u2208{I,Z} hA(1) B (2) C (3) i. Here, the A(i) represent Pauli operators8 acting on Qi (henceforth, the\norder of operators is respected and superscripts are removed for notational simplicity). False positives and negatives introduce weighting coefficients \u03b2ABC . The calibrated values (listed in Methods) demonstrate a high\nsensitivity of the single measurement channel to two- and\nthree-qubit correlations.\nWe use this sensitivity to qubit correlations to perform state tomography of the register. To reconstruct\n\n\f4\nthe three-qubit density matrix \u03c1, we find the coefficients\nof its expansion in the Pauli operator basis:\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n8\n\nX\n\nA,B,C\u2208{I,X,Y,Z}\n\nhABCiABC,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere hIIIi = 1. This is achieved by pre-pending sets of\nsingle-qubit rotations to the readout pulse. The rotations\n\u03c0\n\u03c0/2\n\u03c0/2\nconsist of all combinations of I, Rx , Rx , and Ry on\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\nthe three qubits (except for Rx \u2297Rx \u2297Rx ). Respectively,\nthese rotations on Qi transform the hVH i expression according to Z (i) \u2192 Z (i) , \u2212Z (i) , Y (i) , and \u2212X (i) . An\nensemble of 105 state preparations and single-shot measurements are made for each set, mitigating uncertainty\ndue to projection noise to less than 1%. The non-trivial\ncorrelation coefficients in Eq. (1) are then obtained from\nthe 63 distinct hVH i by matrix inversion.\nWith fast C-Phase gates and high fidelity readout in\nplace, we now demonstrate generation and detection of\nmulti-qubit entanglement. Gate sequences generating\ntwo- and three-qubit entanglement are shown in Fig. 3.\nA simple sequence13 using one C-Phase transforms the\nground state |000i (an unentangled, \u221a\nor separable state)\ninto a Bell triplet |0i \u2297 (|00i + |11i) / 2 with Q2 and Q3\nmaximally entangled (Fig. 3b). Mirroring this sequence\nso that Q1 undergoes the same operations as Q3 (Fig.\n\u221a 3c)\nproduces the GHZ state, |GHZi = (|000i + |111i) / 2, a\nmaximally-entangled state of three qubits. We have implemented these sequences (see Supplementary Fig. S3\nfor the actual microwave and flux pulses realizing the\nGHZ sequence) and performed tomography of their outputs. We visualize the reconstructed \u03c1 in each case using the Pauli set P, consisting of the expectation values of the non-trivial Pauli operators. In Figs. 3d-f, we\nsubdivide P into seven subsets distinguished by color:\n\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\nthree single-qubit Bloch vectors P1 (red), P2 (green),\n\u2192\n\n\u21d2\n\n\u21d2\n\nand P3 (blue); two-qubit correlations P12 (orange), P13\n\u21d2\n\n(purple), and P23 (cyan); and three-qubit correlations\nV\n\nP123 (grey). The experimental P in Figs. 3d-f closely\nmatch the delineated Pauli set Pt of the targeted ground\nstate, the Bell triplet and the GHZ state, respectively.\nWe quantify this similarity using fidelity to the target\nstate |\u03c8t i, F = h\u03c8t | \u03c1 |\u03c8t i = P * Pt /8, finding F = 99, 94\nand 88%, respectively.\nTo make definitive statements about the presence of\ngenuine three-qubit entanglement (3QE) in Fig. 3f, we\nmake use of fidelity to GHZ states as an entanglement\nwitness20 . The maximal fidelity of any bi-separable state\nto a GHZ state is 50%. Any greater fidelity thus witnesses 3QE. Fidelity can even witness the more restrictive GHZ-class within 3QE, since W-class states satisfy\nF \u2264 75%. The 88% fidelity to |GHZi of the Pauli set\nin Fig. 3f constitutes the first demonstration of GHZtype entanglement between three engineered solid-state\nqubits.\nThe production of multi-qubit entanglement is a neces-\n\nsary first step toward quantum error correction. In fact,\nthe simple sequence using two C-Phase gates (Fig. 3c)\nperformed the encoding step of the simplest error correction protocol, the bit-flip code8 . Generally, this encoding maps a logical qubit state \u03b1 |0i + \u03b2 |1i onto the state\n\u03b1 |000i + \u03b2 |111i of three physical qubits. In Fig. 3c,\nthe encoding\n\u221a was performed specifically for the state\n(|0i + |1i) / 2 in Q2 . We have applied this repetition\ncode to other maximal superpositions of Q2 by varying the azimuthal angle \u03c6 of its initial \u03c0/2 rotation\n(Fig. 4a). At each \u03c6, the code \u0001targets\na GHZ state\n\u221a\n|GHZ\u03c6 i = |000i + ei(\u03c6\u2212\u03c0/2) |111i / 2. The fidelity to\n|GHZ\u03c6 i is 87 \u00b1 1% throughout (Fig. 4b). A master\nequation simulation suggests that this uniform fidelity\nis largely limited by qubit relaxation during the 81 ns\npulse sequence. The measured fidelity witnesses GHZclass 3QE at every \u03c6.\nIt is possible to detect three-qubit entanglement with\nlinear witnesses which can be computed using fewer elements of the Pauli set than the fidelity to a GHZ state.\nFor example, the Mermin sums1 MS1 = hXXXi \u2212\nhXY Y i \u2212 hY XY i \u2212 hXY Y i and MS2 = \u2212hY Y Y i +\nhY XXi + hXY Xi + hY XXi satisfy |MS1,2 | \u2264 1 and\n|MS1,2 | \u2264 2 for all separable31 and bi-separable32 states,\nrespectively. Figure 4c shows that at least one of these\nsums detects 3QE at each \u03c6. Note that |MS1,2 | \u2264 2 is\nalso a local-hidden-variable (LHV) bound1 . While the\nmaximal absolute value measured, 3.4 \u00b1 0.1, exceeds this\nbound by 14 standard deviations, the presence of locality and detection loopholes in our system precludes the\nrefutation of local realism.\nOne drawback of the Mermin sums as witnessses of\n3QE is that the bi-separable (and LHV) range overlaps significantly with the quantum range for three\nqubits, |MS1,2 | \u2264 4. Non-linear entanglement witnesses can compress the bi-separable bounds relative to\nthe quantum bounds, effectively magnifying non-trivial\nthree-qubit correlations. We have investigated the Mermin products MP1 = hXXXihXY Y ihY XY ihXY Y i\nand MP2 = hY Y Y ihY XXihXY XihY XXi, finding various bounds numerically. Separable and bi-separable\nstates satisfy 0 \u2264 MP1,2 \u2264 1/64 and \u22121/16 \u2264 MP1,2 \u2264\n1/64, respectively. Their range is only a small fraction of\nthe quantum range for three qubits, \u22121 \u2264 MP1,2 \u2264 1/16,\nas advertised. The LHV range for Mermin products is\n\u22121/16 \u2264 MP1,2 \u2264 1. Note that while the LHV range\nfor Mermin sums is fully inside the range allowed by\nquantum mechanics, the two ranges largely separate for\nproducts, leaving only a narrow region of compatibility |MP1,2 | \u2264 1/16. The measured Mermin products\n(Fig. 4d) reach a minimum value \u22120.52 \u00b1 0.05, exceeding\nthe negative bi-separable (also LHV) bound by 830\u00b180%.\nThe experimental MP1,2 fall largely outside the compatibility region, and fully within the quantum bounds.\nWe have applied conditional-phase gates and joint\nreadout in cQED to produce and detect GHZ-class entanglement between three superconducting qubits. Extending solid-state entanglement beyond two qubits has not\n\n\f5\n0\nz\n\na\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nRy\n\n0 Ry\n\nx\nb\n\nrequired significantly more complex circuit design, fabrication or calibration, and worked the first time. We have\ngenerated GHZ states with fidelity approaching 90% and\ndetected their entanglement using quantum state tomography as well as various linear and nonlinear entanglement witnesses requiring fewer measurements. Finally,\nwe have realized the first step of basic quantum error\ncorrection, namely the encoding of one logical qubit in\nan entangled state of three physical qubits using a repetition code. Future research will focus on the realization\nof an error-syndrome detecting circuit to allow closing\nthe feedback loop needed for error correction.\n\nRepetition code\n\n\u03c6\n\nn\n\u0002\n\n1\n\n01\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n0 Rn\u0302(\u03c6)\n\ny\n\n\u03c0/2\n\n0 Ry\n\n10\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nRy\n\nW-class\n\nbiseparable\n\nc\n\nMS1\nseparable\n\nclassical\nquantum\n\nbiseparable\n\nMS2\n\nMP1\n\nMP2\n\nquantum\n\nclassical\n\nd\n\nFigure 4: Witnessing of three-qubit entanglement using fidelity and Mermin inequalities.\na, Gate\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u221a sei(\u03c6\u2212\u03c0/2)\nquence mapping superpositions |0i + e\n|1i / 2 of\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u221a\ni(\u03c6\u2212\u03c0/2)\nQ2 into GHZ states |GHZ\u03c6 i = |000i + e\n|111i / 2\n\nusing a repetition code. b, Fidelity F = hGHZ\u03c6 | \u03c1 |GHZ\u03c6 i\nas a function of azimuthal angle \u03c6 of initial \u03c0/2-rotation\non Q2 , averaging 87%.

Both \u03c90j and\nnjk are functions23 of qubit charging energy ECq and\nJosephson energy EJq .

Cross-talk (up to \u223c 40%)\nresulting from return currents on the ground plane is corrected by orthogonalization. The above parameters are\nconstrained by the spectroscopy and transmission data\nshown (Figs. 1b, 2, and S2) and similar data (not shown)\nobtained as a function of local flux bias on Q2 to Q4 .\nFitting spectra obtained by numerical diagonalization of\nthe Hamiltonian (truncated to N = 4 qubit levels and 4\ncavity photons) to these data gives \u03c9c /2\u03c0 = 9.070 GHz,\n\n\f6\nmax\nEJq\n/h = {42, 29, 47, 57} GHz (from Q1 to Q4 ), g/2\u03c0 \u2248\n220 MHz, and ECq /h \u2248 330 MHz .\nCoherence times Relaxation (T1 ) and dephasing (T2\u2217 )\ntimes of Q1 to Q3 were measured using standard sliding\n\u03c0-pulse and Ramsey experiments, respectively.

Our setup is an expanded version of the\none presented in Ref. 1, allowing full control of three qubits and biasing of a fourth. Microwave drives: wideband I-Q modulated\nvector generators drive x- and y-rotations on qubits 1, 2, and 3, and arbitrary waveform generators (AWG, models 5014 and\n520, running at 1 GSample/s with 14 and 10-bit vertical resolution) provide the 6 modulation envelopes. A scalar generator\nis pulse modulated with an AWG marker to produce the measurement drive. Flux control: AWGs produce voltage pulses V1\nto V3 for fast flux biasing of Q1 to Q3 . Yokogawa dc sources coupled via bias tees provide the quiescent bias (rather than the\nAWGs), improving the frequency stability of the qubits when operated away from the flux sweet-spot (for example at point I)\nand permitting heavier filtering (attenuation) of the ac-coupled AWG flux drives. Inside the refrigerator, the combination of a\nreactive low-pass filter and a lossy strip-line2 prevents spurious resonant qubit driving while keeping a nearly 50 \u03a9 impedance\nat qubit transition frequencies (looking from the qubit side). Output amplification chain: The output line has \u223c 70 dB gain\nand \u223c 10 K noise temperature in the 4\u20138 GHz range. An I-Q mixer and a two-channel averager (2 ns, 8-bit sampling) are used\nfor homodyne detection of the cavity quadratures. We have eliminated the local oscillator used in Ref. 1 by splitting the cavity\ndrive. The AWGs, microwave synthesizers and acquisition card are clocked with a Rubidium frequency standard (SRS FS725,\nnot shown).\n\n\f3\nGHZ sequence\n\nTomography\n\nM\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nRy\n\nVq3\n\nRy\n\n\u03c0\n\nRx\n\nVi3\n\u03c0/2\n\nRy\n\nVq2\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nRx\n\nVi2\n\u03c0/2\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nRy\n\nVq1\n\nRy\n\n\u03c0/2\n\nRx\n\nVi1\nRz\u03b83\n\nV3\n\nRz\u03b82\n\n12 ns\n\nV2\n\n5 ns\n14 ns\n\nV1\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nRz\u03b81\n\n60\n\nTime (ns) 80\n\nFigure S3: Illustration of the pulse sequence producing the GHZ state shown in Fig. 3c of the main text.

All microwave pulses implementing the x- and y-rotations have Gaussian envelopes,\nwith standard deviation \u03c3 = 2 ns, truncated at \u00b12\u03c3. The rotation axis is set using I-Q (vector) modulation (see Fig. S2), and\nthe rotation angle is controlled by pulse amplitude. To avoid overlap, a buffer of 3 ns is inserted between all pulses. The full\nsequence (including tomography pre-rotations) is completed in 81 ns. The measurement tone is finally pulsed on for 1 \u03bcs.\nRe (\u03c1)\n\na\n\nb\n\n111\n0\n11\n1\n10\n0\n10\n1\n01\n0\n01\n1\n00\n0\n00\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n0 00\n0 01\n0 10\n011\n100\n1 01\n110\n111\n\nIm (\u03c1)\n\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n\nc\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n\nFigure S4: Cityscape plots of reconstructed density matrices.
