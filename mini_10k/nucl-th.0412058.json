Two-body bound states such as mesons are described by solutions of the Bethe\u2013\nSalpeter equation. We discuss recent results for the pseudoscalar and vector meson masses and\nleptonic decay constants, ranging from pions up to cc\u0304 bound states. Our results are in good\nagreement with data. Essential in these calculation is a momentum-dependent quark mass\nfunction, which evolves from a constituent-quark mass in the infrared region to a currentquark mass in the perturbative region. In addition to the mass spectrum, we review the\nelectromagnetic form factors of the light mesons. Electromagnetic current conservation is\nmanifest and the influence of intermediate vector mesons is incorporated self-consistently. The\nresults for the pion form factor are in excellent agreement with experiment.\n\n1. Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations\nThe set of Dyson\u2013Schwinger equations form a Poincar\u00e9 covariant framework within which to\nstudy hadrons [1, 2]. In rainbow-ladder truncation, they have been successfully applied to\ncalculate a range of properties of the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons, see Ref. [2] and\nreferences therein.\nThe DSE for the renormalized quark propagator S(p) in Euclidean space is [1]\nS(p)\u22121 = i Z2 (\u03b6) /\np + Z4 (\u03b6) m(\u03b6) + Z1 (\u03b6)\n\nZ\n\nd4 q 2\ni\ng D\u03bc\u03bd (p \u2212 q) \u03bb2 \u03b3\u03bc S(q) \u0393i\u03bd (q, p) ,\n4\n(2\u03c0)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D\u03bc\u03bd (p \u2212 q) and \u0393i\u03bd (q; p) are the renormalized dressed gluon propagator and\nquark-gluon vertex, respectively.\nThe most general solution of Eq. (1) has the\n\u22121\n2\n2\nform S(p) = i /\npA(p ) + B(p ), renormalized at spacelike \u03b6 2 according to A(\u03b6 2 ) = 1 and\n2\nB(\u03b6 ) = m(\u03b6) with m(\u03b6) the current quark mass.\nMesons are described by solutions of the homogeneous Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation (BSE)\n\u0393H (p+ , p\u2212 ; P ) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 q\nK(p, q; P ) S(q+ ) \u0393H (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) S(q\u2212 ) ,\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(2)\n\n2 , where M is the meson mass. In this equation, p = p + P/2\nat discrete values of P 2 = \u2212MH\nH\n+\nand p\u2212 = p \u2212 P/2 are the outgoing and incoming quark momenta respectively, and similarly for\nq\u00b1 . The kernel K is the renormalized, amputated q q\u0304 scattering kernel that is irreducible with\nrespect to a pair of q q\u0304 lines. Together with the canonical normalization condition for q q\u0304 bound\nstates, Eq. (2) completely determines the bound state Bethe\u2013Salpeter amplitude (BSA) \u0393H .\n\n\fDifferent types of mesons, such as pseudoscalar or vector mesons, are characterized by different\nDirac structures.\nTo solve the BSE, we use the ladder truncation,\ni\n\n0\nK(p, q; P ) \u2192 \u22124\u03c0\u03b1eff ((p \u2212 q)2 ) D\u03bc\u03bd\n(p \u2212 q) \u03bb2 \u03b3\u03bc \u2297\n\n\u03bbi\n2 \u03b3\u03bd\n\n,\n\n(3)\ni\n\nin conjunction with the rainbow truncation for the quark DSE, Eq. (1): \u0393i\u03bd (q, p) \u2192 \u03bb2 \u03b3\u03bd and\n0 (k), with k = p \u2212 q. Here, D 0 (k) is the free gluon propagator\nZ1 g2 D\u03bc\u03bd (k) \u2192 4\u03c0\u03b1eff (k2 )D\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\neff\nin Landau gauge, and \u03b1 (k2 ) an effective quark-quark interaction, which reduces to the oneloop running coupling of perturbative QCD (pQCD) in the perturbative region. This truncation\npreserves both the vector Ward\u2013Takahashi identity (WTI) for the q q\u0304\u03b3 vertex and the axial-vector\nWTI, independent of the details of the effective interaction. The latter ensures the existence\nof massless pseudoscalar mesons associated with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D\u03c7SB)\nin the chiral limit [3, 4]. In combination with an impulse approximation, the former ensures\nelectromagnetic current conservation [5, 6].\n2. Quark propagator: an overview\nA momentum-dependent quark mass function M (p2 ) = B(p2 )/A(p2 ) is central to QCD. In the\nperturbative region this mass function gives the one-loop perturbative running quark mass\nM (p2 ) \u2243\n\nm\u0302\n\u0010\n\n1\n2\n\nh\n\nln p2 /\u039b2QCD\n\ni\u0011\u03b3m ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith the anomalous mass dimension \u03b3m = 12/(33 \u2212 2Nf ). Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking\nmeans that this mass function is nonzero even though the current-quark masses are zero. In the\nchiral limit the mass function is [7]\nMchiral (p2 ) \u2243\n\n\u2212 hq\u0304qi0\n2\u03c0 2 \u03b3m\n\u0010\nh\ni\u00111\u2212\u03b3m ,\n3\np2 12 ln p2 /\u039b2QCD\n\n(5)\n\nwith hq\u0304qi0 the renormalization-point-independent vacuum quark condensate [3].\nIt is a longstanding prediction of DSE studies in QCD that the dressed quark propagator\nreceives strong momentum-dependent corrections at infrared momenta, see e.g. Refs. [1, 2]\nand references therein. Provided that the (effective) quark-quark interaction reduces to the\nperturbative running coupling in the ultraviolet region, it is also straightforward to reproduce\nthe asymptotic behavior of Eqs. (4) and (5) [8, 9]. Both these phenomena are illustrated in the\nleft panel of Fig. 1. In this figure one can also see that the dynamical mass function of the u and\nd quarks becomes very similar to that of quarks in the chiral limit in the infrared region. This\nis a direct consequence of D\u03c7SB, and leads to a mass function of the order of several hundred\nMeV for the light quarks in the infrared, providing one with a constituent mass for quarks inside\nhadrons, even though the corresponding current quark masses are only a few MeV.\nThese predictions were recently confirmed in lattice simulations of QCD [10\u201312]. Quantitative\nagreement between the lattice simulations and the DSE results for the quark propagator\nfunctions can be obtained within the rainbow truncation via a suitable choice for the effective\nquark-quark interaction [13]. Pointwise agreement for a range of quark masses requires this\ninteraction to be flavor-dependent [14], suggesting that dressing the quark-gluon vertex \u0393i\u03bd (q, p)\nis important. Indeed, both lattice simulations [15] and DSE studies [16\u201318] of this vertex indicate\nthat \u0393i\u03bd (q, p) deviates significantly from a bare vertex in the nonperturbative region. A (flavordependent) nonperturbative vertex dressing could make a significant difference for the solution\nof the quark DSE [16, 19], as can be seen from the right panel of Fig. 1. The consequences of a\ndressed vertex for the meson BSEs are currently being explored [16] and indications are that in\nthe pseudoscalar and vector channels, the effects are small [16, 20, 21].\n\n\f0\n\n10\n\nAsqtad lattice data [11]\noverlap lattice data [12]\nDSE, dressed vertex [19]\nDSE, bare vertex [19]\n\n0.3\n\n-1\n\nM(p ) [GeV]\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\nM( p\n\n2\n\n2\n\n) [GeV]\n\n10\n\nc-quark\ns-quark\nu/d-quark\nchiral limit\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n10\n2\n2\np [GeV ]\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\np\n\n4\n\n5\n\n[GeV2]\n\nFigure 1.\nThe dynamical quark mass function M (p2 ) for different quark flavors (left,\nadapted from Ref. [3]) and a comparison of the chiral-limit quark mass function with the lattice\ndata [11, 12] (right, adapted from Ref. [19]).\n3. Pseudoscalar mesons: ground and excited states\nThe meson spectrum contains three pseudoscalars with quantum numbers I G (J P )L = 1\u2212 (0\u2212 )S\nand masses below 2 GeV: \u03c0(140); \u03c0(1300); and \u03c0(1800). In a constituent-quark model, these\nmesons are viewed as the first three members of a q q\u0304 n 1S0 trajectory, where n is the principal\nquantum number with the ground state \u03c00 (the \u03c0(140)), and the others are its first two radial\nexcitations, \u03c01 and \u03c02 . The pseudoscalar trajectory is particularly interesting, because its lowest\nmass member is QCD's Goldstone mode. Therefore an explanation should describe both chiral\nsymmetry and its dynamical breaking as well as a correlation of the ground and excited states\nvia an approximately linear radial Regge trajectory. The latter is easily realized in Poincar\u00e9\ninvariant quantum mechanics [22] but the former is not.\n3.1. Chiral symmetry\nThe chiral properties of QCD are manifest in the axial-vector WTI, which reads\nP\u03bc \u03935\u03bc (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) = S \u22121 (q+ )i\u03b35 + i\u03b35 S \u22121 (q\u2212 ) \u2212 2i mq (\u03b6) \u03935 (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) ,\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03935\u03bc (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) and \u03935 (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) the renormalized dressed axial-vector and pseudoscalar\nvertices, each satisfying an inhomogeneous extension of Eq. (2). Equation (6) is an exact\nstatement in QCD implying that the kernels of the quark DSE, Eq. (1), and of the BSEs have\nto be intimately related. A weak coupling expansion of the DSEs yields perturbation theory\nand satisfies this constraint, but is not useful in the study of intrinsically nonperturbative\nphenomena. However, a systematic and symmetry preserving nonperturbative truncation\nscheme exists [16, 20, 21], allowing for both elucidation and illustration of the consequences\nof the axial-vector WTI.\nPseudoscalar mesons appear as pole contributions to the axial-vector and pseudoscalar\nvertices at P 2 = \u2212M\u03c02n . The residues of these poles are\nd4 q\nTr [\u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc S(q+ ) \u0393\u03c0n (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) S(q\u2212 ) ] ,\n(2\u03c0)4\nZ 4\nd q\ni\u03c1\u03c0n(\u03b6) = Z4 (\u03b6)\nTr [\u03b35 S(q+ ) \u0393\u03c0n (q+ , q\u2212 ; P ) S(q\u2212 ) ] ,\n(2\u03c0)4\nf\u03c0n P\u03bc = Z2 (\u03b6)\n\nZ\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\n\fboth of which are gauge invariant and cutoff independent. It follows from Eq. (6) that these\nresidues satisfy the following exact identity in QCD [4, 23]\nf\u03c0n M\u03c02n = 2 m(\u03b6) \u03c1\u03c0n (\u03b6) ,\n\n(9)\n\nvalid for every 0\u2212 meson [24], irrespective of the magnitude of the current quark mass [25].\nFor the \u03c00 , D\u03c7SB yields: limm\u0302\u21920 f\u03c00 6= 0 and limm\u0302\u21920 \u03c1(\u03b6) = \u22122hq\u0304qi0\u03b6 /f\u03c000 6= 0. Hence,\nthe Gell-Mann\u2013Oakes\u2013Renner relation emerges as a corollary of Eq. (9) and the ground state\npion is QCD's Goldstone mode [4]. For the n \u2265 1 pseudoscalar mesons one has M\u03c0n\u22651 > M\u03c00\nby assumption, and hence M\u03c0n>0 6= 0 in the chiral limit. Furthermore, the ultraviolet behavior\nof the quark-antiquark scattering kernel in QCD guarantees that \u03c1\u03c0n (\u03b6) is finite in the chiral\nlimit. Hence, it is a necessary consequence of chiral symmetry and the axial-vector WTI that\nf\u03c0n vanishes in the chiral limit for all excited pseudoscalar mesons (i. e. for all n > 0) [24].\n3.2. Numerical results\nWe now illustrate the exact results reviewed above in a model that both preserves QCD's\nultraviolet properties and exhibits D\u03c7SB, namely the rainbow-ladder truncation of the set of\nDSEs. For the infrared behavior of the effective quark-quark interaction, \u03b1eff (k2 ), we employ\nan Ansatz [3, 26] that is sufficiently enhanced in the infrared to produce a realistic value for the\nvacuum quark condensate of about (240 GeV)3 . The model parameters, along with the quark\nmasses [26, 27], are fitted to give a good description of the chiral condensate, M\u03c0/K/\u03b7c and f\u03c0 .\nThe obtained quark propagator functions agree qualitatively with lattice simulations.\nThe main results for the pseudoscalar and vector meson masses and leptonic decay constants\nare summarized in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig. 2. Regarding the table one should note that the\nrainbow-ladder truncation gives \"ideal\" flavor mixing and the study uses m\u0302u = m\u0302d 6= m\u0302s 6= m\u0302c .\nThus the first row simultaneously describes four degenerate mesons for each column, namely,\n \u0304 u\u016b \u2212 dd,d\u016b}\n \u0304\na {ud,\nisotriplet and a u\u016b + dd \u0304 isosinglet. The second row describes ss\u0304 mesons,\nand the third row cc\u0304 mesons. For vector mesons ideal mixing is a very good approximation,\nthough this is not the case for the pseudoscalar ground states. However, the experimental\ndegeneracy of the \u03c0(1300) and \u03b7(1295) suggests [28] that ideal mixing is almost realized for the\nexcited pseudoscalar mesons. This supports the interpretation of the \u03b7(1295) and \u03b7(1470) as\nthe radial excitations of the \u03b7(548) and \u03b7 \u2032 (958), with quark content almost entirely u\u016b + dd \u0304 and\nss\u0304 respectively [27]. Figure 2 shows bound-state masses and leptonic decay constants for the\nground and excited states of pseudoscalar mesons as well as ground-state vector-meson masses\nas functions of the current-quark mass. It illustrates that m\u03c00 vanishes in the chiral limit, while\nm\u03c1 and m\u03c01 do not; on the other hand, f\u03c01 vanishes in the chiral limit, while f\u03c00 does not.\n\nTable 1.

The masses M of the pseudoscalar ground and first radially excited states (left) and\nthe corresponding weak decay constants (right) as functions of the current-quark mass mq . For\ncomparison, we also include the mass of the ground-state vector mesons.\nSatisfaction of the axial-vector WTI can be checked by virtue of Eq. (9) for any pseudoscalar\nmeson in Table 1. For the ground and excited states the inaccuracies are below 1% and 5%,\nrespectively. The latter are larger because of: (1) the need to project out the ground state in\norder to calculate the excited state, (2) the smallness of f\u03c01 close to the chiral limit, and (3) the\nlarger bound-state mass, leading to a larger region of analytic continuation for the quark DSE\nsolution in the complex p2 plane.\n4. Electromagnetic form factors\nMeson-meson-photon interactions can be described in generalized impulse approximation by\nI\n\nabc\n\n(P, Q, K) =\n\nZ\n\nd4 q\nTr[S a (q) \u0393ab\u0304 (q, q \u2032 ; P )S b (q \u2032 ) \u0393bc\u0304 (q \u2032 , q \u2032\u2032 ; Q) S c (q \u2032\u2032 ) \u0393c\u0101 (q \u2032\u2032 , q; K)] ,\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(10)\n\nwhere q \u2212 q \u2032 = P , q \u2032 \u2212 q \u2032\u2032 = Q, q \u2032\u2032 \u2212 q = K, and momentum conservation dictates P + Q + K = 0.\nIn Eq. (10), S i is the dressed quark propagator with flavor index i, and \u0393ij\u0304 (k, k\u2032 ; P ) stands for\na generic vertex function with incoming quark flavor j and momentum k\u2032 , and outgoing quark\nflavor i and momentum k. Depending on the specific process under consideration, this vertex\nfunction could be a meson BSA or a quark-photon vertex.\nThe quark-photon vertex, \u0393\u03bc (p+ , p\u2212 ; Q), with Q the photon momentum and p\u00b1 the quark\nmomenta, is the solution of the inhomogeneous BSE\n\u0393\u03bc (p+ , p\u2212 ; Q) = Z2 (\u03b6) \u03b3\u03bc +\n\nZ\n\nd4 q\nK(p, q; Q) S(q+ ) \u0393\u03bc (q+ , q\u2212 ; Q) S(q\u2212 ) .\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n(11)\n\nSolutions of the homogeneous version of Eq. (11) define vector meson bound states at timelike\nphoton momenta Q2 = \u2212MV2 . It follows that \u0393\u03bc (p+ , p\u2212 ; Q) has poles at these locations [6] (see\nalso the vector-meson masses in Table 1).\n4.1.

Right: The transition form factor F\u03c9\u03c0\u03b3 (Q2 ) together with experimental data [40].\nWith photon momentum Q, and incoming and outgoing meson momenta P \u2213 Q/2, we can define\na form factor for each of these diagrams [6]\n2 P\u03bd Fab\u0304;b\u0304 (Q2 ) = I\u03bdab\u0304;b\u0304 (P \u2212 Q/2, Q, \u2212(P + Q/2)) .\n\n(12)\n\nWe work in the isospin symmetric limit, and thus F\u03c0 (Q2 ) = Fu\u016b;u (Q2 ). The K + and K 0 form\nfactors are given by FK + = 32 Fus\u0304;u + 31 Fus\u0304;s\u0304 and FK 0 = \u2212 31 Fds\u0304;d + 13 Fds\u0304;s\u0304 , respectively.\nOur result for Q2 F\u03c0 are shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. In the timelike region, and in\nthe spacelike region up to about Q2 = 2 GeV 2 , F\u03c0 can be described very well by a monopole\nwith our calculated \u03c1-mass, m\u03c1 = 742 MeV (note that our calculated \u03c1-mass is slightly below\nthe experimental value). Above this value, our curve starts to deviate more and more from this\nnaive vector meson dominance (VMD) monopole. Our result is in excellent agreement with the\nmost recent JLab data [30]; it would be very interesting to compare with future JLab data in\nthe 3 to 5 GeV2 range, where we expect to see a significant deviation from the naive monopole\nbehavior. The pQCD prediction is significantly smaller than our results at 4 GeV2 ; we anticipate\nthat true perturbative behavior sets in somewhere between 10 and 20 GeV2 [32].\nRecent lattice simulation also indicate that in the region between 0 and 2 GeV2 the pion\nform factor can be represented by a VMD-like monopole [33, 34]. This VMD-like behavior of\nthe pion form factor in the spacelike region appears to be valid almost independent of the pion\nmass, both in our calculations and in the lattice simulations, though a monopole fit results in a\nVMD-mass which is slightly less than the actual vector meson mass. Current lattice simulations\nare not accurate enough, nor do they extend to large enough values of Q2 , to detect a significant\ndeviation from VMD-like behavior above 2 GeV2 .\nAlso our results [6] for FK agree quite well with the available experimental data, as do both\nthe neutral and the charged kaon charge radius [35, 36], see Table 2. It should be noted here\nthat the K 0 form factor is obtained by taking the difference of two numbers, Fds\u0304;d (Q2 ) and\nFds\u0304;s\u0304 (Q2 ), which are both close to one for Q2 near zero. It is therefore much more sensitive to\ndetails of the model: both kaon loops and a flavor dependence of the (effective) quark-quark\ninteraction will have a significantly bigger effect on the K 0 form factor than on the K + form\nfactor. This could explain why it does not agree as well with experiment as our other results. In\nthis respect one should note that the absolute deviation between our calculated charge radius\nand the experimental charge radius is similar for the charged and neutral kaon.\n\n\f4.2. Radiative vector-meson decays\nWe can describe the radiative decay of the vector mesons using the same loop integral, Eq. (10),\nthis time with one vector meson BSA, one pseudoscalar BSA, and one q q\u0304\u03b3-vertex [37]. The\ngeneric structure of a vector-pseudoscalar-photon vertex is\nab\u0304;a\nI\u03bc\u03bd\n(P, Q, \u2212(P + Q)) = \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 P\u03b1 Q\u03b2 fab\u0304;a (Q2 ) ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere P is the vector momentum and Q the photon momentum. The on-shell value gives us the\ncoupling constant, and can be used to calculate the partial decay width of the vector mesons.\nFor virtual photons, we can define a transition form factor FV P \u03b3 (Q2 ), normalized to 1 at Q2 = 0,\nwhich can be used in estimating meson-exchange contributions to hadronic processes [38, 39].\nIn the isospin limit, both the \u03c10 \u03c0 0 \u03b3 and \u03c1\u00b1 \u03c0 \u00b1 \u03b3 vertices are given by\ng\u03c1\u03c0\u03b3\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 P\u03b1 Q\u03b2 F\u03c1\u03c0\u03b3 (Q2 ) =\nm\u03c1\n\n1 u\u016b;u\n3 I\u03bc\u03bd (P, Q, \u2212(P\n\n+ Q)) .\n\n(14)\n\nThe \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03b3 vertex is a factor of 3 larger, due to the difference in isospin factors; however, the form\nfactor FV P \u03b3 (Q2 ) is the same for \u03c1 \u03c0 \u03b3 and \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03b3. In contrast to the elastic form factors, this\ntransition form factor falls off significantly faster than a VMD-like monopole, as can be seen in\nthe right panel of Fig. 3. Only in the timelike region, near the vector meson pole, do we see a\ntrue VMD-like behavior.\nAs Eq. (14) shows, it is gV P \u03b3 /mV that is the natural outcome of our calculations. Therefore,\nit is this combination that we give in Table 2, together with the corresponding partial decay\nwidths [37]. As anticipated, the partial decay width \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 is indeed (approximately) nine\ntimes larger than the \u03c9 \u2192 \u03c0\u03b3 partial decay width. Note that part of the difference between\nthe experimental and calculated decay width comes from the phase space factor because our\ncalculated vector meson masses deviate up to 5% from the physical masses.\nFor the K \u22c6 K\u03b3 decays (and corresponding form factors) [41] the situation is more complicated\nowing to the interference of the diagrams with the photon coupled to the s-quark and to the\nu- or d-quark. In the SU(3) flavor limit, the charged K \u22c6 K \u03b3 vertex becomes equal to the \u03c1 \u03c0 \u03b3\nvertex, whereas the neutral K \u22c6 K \u03b3 vertex is twice as large in magnitude\ngK \u22c6 K\u03b3 + +\nFK \u22c6 K\u03b3 (Q2 ) = 32 fus\u0304;u (Q2 ) \u2212 13 fus\u0304;s\u0304 (Q2 ) ,\nmK \u22c6\n\u0012\n\u0013\ngK \u22c6 K\u03b3 0 0\nFK \u22c6 K\u03b3 (Q2 ) = \u2212 13 fds\u0304;d (Q2 ) \u2212 31 fus\u0304;s\u0304 (Q2 ) .\nmK \u22c6\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nIn Table 2 we see indeed that the partial decay width of the neutral K \u22c6 \u2192 K\u03b3 is larger than\nthat of the charged K \u22c6 \u2192 K\u03b3, though not by a factor of four as it would in the SU(3) flavor\n\nTable 2.
