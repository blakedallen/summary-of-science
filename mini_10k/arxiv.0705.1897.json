In recent years, the subject of quantum gravity phenomenology\nhas rapidly grown (see [2] for a review), complementing theoretical work.\n\u2217 Corresponding author\nEmail address: E.Winstanley@sheffield.ac.uk (Elizabeth Winstanley).\n\nPreprint submitted to Astroparticle Physics\n\n8 June 2018\n\n\fOne particular feature of quantum gravity which has attracted much attention in particle and astro-particle physics phenomenology is the breaking of\nCPT symmetry (see, for example, [3] for a review). CPT symmetry is anticipated to be broken in quantum gravity because the prerequisite conditions\nof quantum coherence, locality or Lorentz invariance may no longer hold. In\nprevious work [4,5,6] we have studied the effect of quantum decoherence on atmospheric and astrophysical neutrino oscillations, and in the present work we\nturn our attention to Lorentz invariance violation. We focus on atmospheric\nneutrino oscillations, having considered Lorentz invariance violating effects on\nastrophysical neutrinos in [6]. As in our previous work [4], in this paper we\ntake a phenomenological viewpoint. We examine, independent of any one particular theory of quantum gravity, what we may expect to observe if Lorentz\nsymmetry is broken or deformed.\nThere is already a large body of work relating to Lorentz invariance violation\nand neutrinos, some of which is briefly reviewed in the following section. Furthermore, existing atmospheric neutrino data has been thoroughly analyzed\nfor both Lorentz invariance violating effects and other new physics (see, for\nexample, [7,8,9]). Although the analysis of Super-Kamiokande and K2K data\n[7,8] strongly disfavours Lorentz invariance violation as either the leading or\nsub-leading cause of atmospheric neutrino oscillations, an analysis of highenergy atmospheric neutrino oscillations, as would be observed at a neutrino\ntelescope, would enable a wider range of Lorentz invariance violating models\nto be probed, as well as offering the possibility of further strengthening existing bounds on Lorentz invariance violating parameters. This can be seen in\nthe recent analysis of MACRO data [9] using both low (< 30 GeV) and high\n(> 130 GeV) energy neutrinos.\nIn this paper, we consider the sensitivity of the ANTARES neutrino telescope\n[10] to Lorentz invariance violating effects although we expect a similar analysis to be applicable to other neutrino telescopes, such as ICECUBE [11],\nNESTOR [12] and NEMO [13]. Whilst neutrino telescopes are primarily designed to observe neutrinos from astrophysical and cosmological origins, atmospheric neutrinos form the primary background to these sources and it is\nlikely that they will provide the first physics results.\nThe outline of this article is as follows. In section 2, we briefly discuss some\nof the theoretical consequences from Lorentz invariance violation, in particular modified dispersion relations. We then model how modified dispersion\nrelations alter atmospheric neutrino oscillations in section 3. We present the\nresults of our simulations for the ANTARES neutrino telescope in section 4,\nwhere we first consider how the observed spectra of events may be altered by\nLorentz invariance violating effects and then present the results of our sensitivity simulations. In section 5, we present our conclusions and compare the\nresults obtained here with those from previous analyses of experimental data\n2\n\n\f[7,8,9]. Unless otherwise stated, we use units in which c = ~ = 1.\n\n2\n\nQuantum gravity violations of Lorentz invariance and the effect\non neutrino oscillations\n\nIn quantum gravity, space-time is expected to take on a foamy nature [14].\nModels of space-time foam have been built in many frameworks, including\ncritical [15,16] and non-critical string theory [17], and loop quantum gravity\n[18]. Interactions with this space-time foam may lead to the breaking of CPT\nsymmetry, leading to the violation of Lorentz invariance [19]. In addition, some\ntheories of quantum gravity predict that there is a minimum length scale, of\norder the Planck length (10\u221235 m) [15,20]. If this is the case, then the existence\nof a fundamental length scale may also lead to Lorentz invariance violation\n(LV).\nTo illustrate this, imagine if we were able to somehow measure this fundamental length scale. We could measure it in our lab frame and probably find that it\nwas of order the Planck length, 10\u221235 m. If we now repeated the experiment in\na different inertial frame (moving relative to the first frame), we would expect\nthe length to be shorter, as predicted by the usual Lorentz contraction. However, we are considering a fundamental length scale and, therefore, we would\nalso expect to measure the same length in all inertial frames. There is, therefore, either an error in our naive thought experiment or Lorentz symmetry, at\nleast at the Planck scale, is broken.\nTherefore, there exist three possibilities for the fate of Lorentz invariance\nwithin theories of quantum gravity:\n(1) It may be that our naive thought experiment is wrong, or that a fundamental length scale does not exist, and so Lorentz invariance remains\nintact at Planck scales;\n(2) It may be that, at the Planck scale, Lorentz invariance is broken and\nthere is a preferred frame;\n(3) It may be that Lorentz invariance as we know it is deformed, so, for\nexample, the Lorentz transformation involves a second quantity which is\nnot observer dependent. So, perhaps the Planck length is invariant in an\nidentical way to the speed of light.\nIn the second and third options, one consequence of such breaking/deforming\nof Lorentz invariance may be that quantities we think of as being Lorentz\ninvariant, such as the standard dispersion relation, E 2 = p2 + m2 , may also\nhave to be modified.\n3\n\n\fLorentz invariance violation may manifest itself in many different ways and\nin many different experimental systems [21,22]. Our focus here is on neutrinos and modified dispersion relations. However, modifications of dispersion\nrelations have also been considered for photons [23,24], leading to dispersion\nrelations of the form [24]:\n!\n\nk\n\u03c9 =k 1\u2212\n+ O(M \u22122 ) ,\nM\nwhere \u03c9 is the frequency of the photon, k its momentum and M is the mass\nscale of the quantum gravitational theory. By considering photons which originate in astrophysical objects such as gamma ray bursts and pulsars, lower\nbounds of \u223c 1017 GeV [24] were placed on M by considering the delay in\narrival times.\nIn the literature, the effects of LV on neutrino oscillations can be broken down\ninto two distinct categories. In the first category are those models in which\nthe only modification is to the neutrino oscillation length [6,25,26,27], which\nis the type of LV model we shall consider in this paper.\nIn the second category are those models in which both the oscillation length\nand also the mixing angle are altered. In our simulations, we found that including LV effects on the mixing angle as well as the neutrino oscillation length\nmade no difference to our results and so we do not study this type of model\nin detail. This type of LV, where both the mixing angle and oscillation length\nare altered, has been considered for the ICECUBE [28] and MINOS [29] experiments in addition to future neutrino factories [30].\n\n3\n\nModified dispersion relations and neutrino oscillation\nprobabilities\n\nOur interest in this paper is how LV effects, as described in the previous\nsection, may alter the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos. Therefore, in the\nanalysis which follows, we restrict ourselves to a simple two neutrino system\nalthough it is possible to consider how these effects manifest themselves in a\nthree neutrino system [6].\nIf we allow LV then this may lead to modifications of the dispersion relation\n[25,26,31,32]:\nE 2 = p2 + m2 + f (p, E, Ep ),\n(1)\nwhere E is the energy of the neutrino, p the neutrino momentum, m is the\nmass eigenvalue of the neutrino and Ep is the Planck energy. The function f\ncontains all the novel LV effects. For our analysis here, we find it useful to\n4\n\n\fparameterize this function so the dispersion relation (1) becomes [32]\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nE = p + m + \u03b7p\n\nE\nEp\n\n2\n\n!\u03b1\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03b1 are parameters of the Lorentz invariance violating theory.\nUsing (2) and assuming the parameter \u03b7 has a dependence upon the mass\neigenstate, then we find that the Hamiltonian in the mass basis, for a two\nneutrino system, may be written, to first order in \u03b7, as\n\uf8eb\n\nH=\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\nm21\n2E\n\n\u03b71 E \u03b1+1\n2\n\n+\n\n0\nm22\n2E\n\n0\n\n+\n\n\u03b72 E \u03b1+1\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere mi and \u03b7i are the mass and LV parameter of the ith eigenstate. Here we\nare considering only the case when the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the mass\nbasis, as off-diagonal terms will modify the neutrino mixing angle as well as\nthe oscillation length.\nThe probability that a neutrino of flavour a oscillates to one of flavour b is\nthen given by\nP [\u03bda \u2192 \u03bdb ] =\n\n2\nX\n\n2\n\nUai e\n\n\u2212Hii\n\nUbi\u2217\n\n,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere the U's are the components of the neutrino mixing matrix:\n\uf8eb\n\nU =\uf8ed\n\uf8ec\n\n\uf8f6\n\ncos \u03b8 sin \u03b8 \uf8f7\n\n\u2212 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8\n\n\uf8f8,\n\nwith \u03b8 being the mixing angle. The oscillation probability is therefore\n2\n\nP [\u03bda \u2192 \u03bdb ] = sin 2\u03b8 sin\n\n2\n\n\"\n\n\u2206m2 L \u2206\u03b7E \u03b1+1 L\n,\n+\n4E\n4Ep\u03b1\n#\n\nwhere \u2206m2 = m22 \u2212 m21 and \u2206\u03b7 = \u03b72 \u2212 \u03b71 . Replacing c and ~ and absorbing\nthe Planck energy into the parameter \u2206\u03b7 gives\nP [\u03bda \u2192 \u03bdb ] = sin2 2\u03b8 sin2\n\n\u2206m2 L\n+ 1.27 \u00d7 109(n+1) \u2206\u03b7E n L ,\n1.27\nE\n#\n\n\"\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u2206m2 is measured in eV2 , the neutrino energy E in GeV, the path length\nL in km, and we have set n = \u03b1 + 1. If we set \u2206\u03b7 = 0 in (4), then we recover\nthe standard oscillation probability\n2\n\nP [\u03bda \u2192 \u03bdb ] = sin 2\u03b8 sin\n\n5\n\n2\n\n\u2206m2 L\n1.27\n,\nE\n\n\"\n\n#\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhereas, if we set \u2206m2 = 0, we find a probability in which neutrinos oscillate\ndue to LV effects only:\nh\n\ni\n\nP [\u03bda \u2192 \u03bdb ] = sin2 2\u03b8 sin2 1.27 \u00d7 109(n+1) \u2206\u03b7E n L .\nIn (3), we have assumed that the LV parameter \u03b7 has a dependence upon the\nmass eigenstate. If this is not the case and the parameter \u03b7 is universal to\nall mass eigenstates, then, even if the theory violates Lorentz invariance, the\nneutrino oscillation probability is unchanged.\nIn this paper, we shall consider three models with differing energy dependences, namely:\n(1) Model LV1 - with n = 1: here the LV parameter \u2206\u03b7 in (4) is dimensionless;\n(2) Model LV2 - with n = 2: then \u2206\u03b7 has units of eV\u22121 ;\n(3) Model LV3 - with n = 3: in which case \u2206\u03b7 has units eV\u22122 .\nIt may be, in a phenomenology of quantum gravity, that n is not an integer\nbut we only consider integer values here (the results for non-integer n can\nbe found by interpolating between the two bounding integer values). Models\nwith n = \u22121, 0 and 1 have been examined using Super-Kamiokande [7] data,\nand more complicated models with n = 0 or 1 have been analyzed using\nboth Super-Kamiokande and K2K data [8]. We do not consider n < 1 here\nas n = 0 models have been severely constrained by these previous analyses,\nand, since in that case the LV modifications of the oscillation probability are\nindependent of the neutrino energy, we do not expect to be able to improve\non their bounds by using higher-energy atmospheric neutrinos. Therefore we\nonly consider values of n which are strictly positive, and include n = 1 for\ncomparison with previous work [7,8]. From our work on quantum decoherence\neffects on atmospheric neutrino oscillations [4], one might anticipate that we\nwill be able to place more stringent bounds on LV effects as n increases.\nIn the next section, we shall be concerned with finding upper bounds on the\nLV parameters. However, we are able to extract crude order of magnitude\nestimates for these parameters from the oscillation probability (4).

We would hope that the much greater number\nof such events that will be observed at a neutrino telescope would enable these\nbounds to be improved.\nTo see how Lorentz invariance violation affects atmospheric neutrino oscillations, it is useful to compare the oscillation probabilities. Whilst the neutrino\noscillation probabilities themselves are not observables, they are useful for\ngaining insight into the underlying physics. Firstly, for comparison, we consider the standard oscillation probability which is given by (5). In all the\nprobabilities presented here, we take [34]\n\u2206m2 = 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ;\n\nsin2 2\u03b8 = 1.\n\nFig. 1 shows the oscillation probability plotted as a function of the path length,\nL, for neutrino energy 200 GeV and as a function of the neutrino energy, E,\nfor a fixed path length, L = 104 km (which is comparable with the diameter\nof the Earth, and used in the oscillation probability plots in [9]).\nFigs. 2, 3 and 4 show the oscillation probability including LV effects (4) for\nn = 1, 2 and 3 respectively. To construct these plots, we used the upper\nbounds found in section 4 and shown in table 2. In each case, we found\nthat for low energy neutrinos, the effects of LV on the neutrino oscillation\nprobability are negligible. However, for higher energy neutrinos, this is not\nthe case. If we compare the plots of probability against path length for high\nenergy neutrinos, we see that for standard oscillations, almost no oscillations\noccur, however, if we include the LV effects, the oscillation probability becomes significant at much shorter path lengths.

Corresponding plots of\natmospheric neutrino survival probabilities can be found in [9] for the mass\nand velocity eigenstate mixing LV model. Their plots have some features in\ncommon with ours, in particular the existence of oscillations in the probability at high energies, when the survival probability in the standard oscillation\nscenario has converged to unity.\nIn [4], we studied in depth the effect of quantum decoherence on atmospheric\nneutrino oscillations. In that case, there were also marked differences in the\noscillation probability, particularly for high energies and long path lengths.\nHowever, the probabilities with LV are rather different from those when we\nhave quantum decoherence. In the decoherence case, the oscillations in the\nprobability are damped (the rate of damping depending on a number of factors), but here we find that the oscillations in the probability continue for ever.\nWhile these two possible sources of new physics give very different properties\nof the oscillation probability, the key test is whether these differences can be\nobserved experimentally. We turn to this issue in the next section.\n\n4\n\nANTARES sensitivity to LV in atmospheric neutrino oscillations\n\nThe ANTARES neutrino telescope [10] is sensitive to high energy neutrinos\nabove the energy threshold of 10 GeV. These neutrinos do not form the primary source of neutrinos for ANTARES, instead they form the background\nto astrophysical and cosmological neutrinos.\n\n4.1 Simulations\n\nOur simulation strategy follows that presented in [4], so we only briefly outline\nthe key features. Further details are documented in [4], and in the analysis of\n9\n\n\fstandard atmospheric neutrino oscillations [35], on which our simulations are\nbased (with suitable modifications for the inclusion of LV).\nAtmospheric neutrino events were generated using a Monte-Carlo (MC) production assuming a spectrum of E \u22122 for neutrinos in the energy range 10 GeV <\nE < 100 TeV. The angular distribution was assumed to be isotropic. A total of twenty five years of data were simulated in order that errors from the\nMonte-Carlo statistics could be ignored and event weights are used to adapt\nthe Monte-Carlo flux to a real atmospheric neutrino flux. The Bartol theoretical flux [36] was used here although we do not anticipate the results presented\nwill change using a different flux, however, there may be a significant change\nto our results if a different spectral index is assumed.\nThe simulations presented here are based on three years' worth of data taking\nwith ANTARES, corresponding to around 10000 atmospheric neutrino events.\nAll errors are purely statistical with simple Gaussian errors assumed. We are\nable to produce spectra in either E, E/L or L and, by altering the oscillation\nprobability in the neutrino oscillation code, we are able to include LV effects.\nThe path length L is related to the zenith angle \u03b8 (not to be confused with\nthe mixing angle \u03b8) as follows, provided cos \u03b8 6= 0:\nL \u2248 2R cos \u03b8,\nwhere R = 6378 km is the radius of the Earth, and \u03b8 = 0 corresponds to a\nneutrino travelling vertically upwards. We are therefore interested in typical\npath lengths of the order L \u2248 104 km. ANTARES is particularly sensitive to\nthe zenith angle \u03b8 and hence the path length L. In the sensitivity analysis, we\ntherefore used the spectra in E/L. However, the spectra in L alone also have\nsome interesting features, which we discuss below.\nIn order to produce sensitivity regions, we use a \u03c72 technique which compares\nthe \u03c72 for oscillations with LV, or LV effects alone, with that for the nooscillation hypothesis. We leave the total normalization as a free parameter\nso that our results are not affected by the normalization of the atmospheric\nneutrino flux. Sensitivity regions at both the 90 and 99 percent confidence\nlevel are produced.\nAlthough our analysis is independent of the normalization of the atmospheric\nneutrino flux, in order to produce spectra based on the number of observed\nevents, some normalization is necessary. For standard oscillations with no LV\neffects, bins at high E/L can be used to normalize the flux as standard oscillations become negligible here. However, since all our LV models are proportional to positive powers of the neutrino energy, LV effects are significant at\nhigh energies but negligible at low energies, and thus low E/L. In this case,\nwe use the low E/L bins to normalize the flux.\n10\n\n\fIn our simulations, we consider cases where \u2206m2 is zero, so neutrino oscillations arise due to LV effects only, and where \u2206m2 is non-zero, so that the\nLV effects modify standard neutrino oscillations. In the case when \u2206m2 is\nnon-zero, we also allow this parameter to vary in order to check whether the\nexperimental point of best fit lies inside our sensitivity regions. In this case,\nwe have three parameters, \u2206m2 , \u2206\u03b7 and sin2 2\u03b8. We therefore obtain a three\ndimensional sensitivity region at 90 and 99% confidence levels. In order to\nconsider the details of the sensitivity region, we plot the boundaries of the\nprojection of the surface bounding this volume onto the coordinate planes,\nthus obtaining three distinct plots.\n\n4.2 Spectra\n\nIn addition to data based on the total number of observed events, the spectra\nof these events, typically in E/L, is also important. For example, spectral\nanalysis has been performed for Super-Kamiokande [7,8,33], KamLAND [37]\nand K2K [8,38]. In addition to being used in the construction of sensitivity\nregions, the spectra themselves are also important for bounding the size of\npossible LV effects and possibly ruling effects out due to the observed shape of\nthe spectra. As explained above, we used the spectra in E/L in the sensitivity\nanalysis, so we focus on those spectra (apart from Fig. 5).\n\n4.2.1 Model LV1\nWe begin by examining the spectra obtained when we consider the possibility\nthat neutrino oscillations occur as a consequence of LV only (\u2206m2 = 0 in Eq.\n(4)), when the LV effects are proportional to the neutrino energy, n = 1. Fig.\n5 shows the expected spectra of events as a function of E/ cos \u03b8 and cos \u03b8.\nThe solid line corresponds to the MC simulation with standard oscillations\nwhereas the dotted/dashed lines are the MC simulations for LV only induced\noscillations. In each case, we have also plotted simulated data points, based\non the standard oscillation picture with no LV effects. On the right-hand-side,\nwe show the ratios of the number of events compared to no oscillations.\nThe spectra show that, for the larger values of the LV parameter, there is a\ndefinite suppression in the number of observed events by a factor of approximately two. If, however, we consider the case in which the LV parameter\ntakes the smaller value, it is more difficult to distinguish oscillations that arise\nas a consequence of LV effects from those arising in the standard oscillation\npicture. If we consider the ratios, we note that there are some features which\nwould allow us to differentiate between the two phenomenologies.

The solid line represents the MC simulation\nof standard oscillations with the dotted/dashed lines showing the spectra for oscillations from LV only. The simulated data points correspond to three-years' data\ntaking, assuming standard oscillations only with no LV.\n\noscillation minimum whereas the standard oscillation model does. Secondly,\nalthough the difference is small, the bottom right frame shows a deviation\nfrom the standard picture at high values of the zenith angle corresponding\nto large path lengths. We will not consider further spectra just in the path\nlength cos \u03b8, but note that for all the models we study and all the energy\ndependences of the LV parameters, there are slight deviations in the shape\nof the spectra in cos \u03b8 compared with the standard oscillation case. In the\nanalysis of Super-Kamiokande data [7,8] it is the spectra in the path-length L\nwhich are used to bound the magnitudes of LV parameters, as the inclusion\nof LV effects again alters the shape of the spectra.\nFor the remainder of this section, we focus on the ratios of the numbers of\nevents in each case compared with the expected number of events if there were\nno oscillations.

The simulated data\npoints assume only standard oscillations, with no LV effects.\n\nLV as a function of E/ cos \u03b8. Again, we note that large values of the LV parameters result in a large suppression of the number of expected events. Also,\nfor very large values of the LV parameter, we see a considerable flattening in\nthe ratio of the number of events compared with no oscillations. The situation\nis much trickier, however, for very small values of the LV parameter. In this\ncase, the number of events expected is not suppressed and we also see an oscillation minimum. Therefore, this makes it very difficult to distinguish between\nstandard oscillations and those which are modified to include LV effects, if the\nLV parameter is of the order of 10\u221226 or smaller.\n\n4.2.2 Models LV2 and LV3\nWe first consider the spectra when the LV parameters are proportional to the\nsquare of the neutrino energy. Fig. 7 shows the ratio of number of events with\nthe LV effects only to those expected if there were no oscillations. For large\nvalues of the LV parameters, we note that the spectra are very different from\nstandard neutrino oscillations. Firstly, as in the case before, the number of\nevents is significantly suppressed for very large values of the LV parameter. For\nstandard neutrino oscillations, we observe an oscillation minimum, however,\nfor large values of the LV parameter, the ratio increases and so we see a\npeak. Even for smaller values of the LV parameter, the ratio is flat and so by\nconsidering the spectra it should be possible to distinguish between these two\nmodels.\n13\n\n\fRatio\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n1\n10\n\nno LV effects\n-35\n-1\n\u2206\u03b7=10 eV\n-37\n-1\n\u2206\u03b7=10-39 eV-1\n\u2206\u03b7=10 eV\n10\n\n2\n\n3\n\n10\n10\nE / cos \u03b8 (GeV)\n\n4\n\nFig. 7.

For large values of the LV parameter, the only distinguishing\nfeature is that the number of events we expect to see is somewhat reduced. In\naddition, for large values of the LV parameter, the curve is much flatter than\nwe would expect from standard oscillations.\nWe find qualitatively similar results when the LV effects are proportional to\n14\n\n\f10\n\n-23\n\n10\n\n-24\n\n10\n\n-25\n\n10\n\n-26\n\n10\n\n-27\n\n\u2206\u03b7\n\n90 % C.L.\n99 % C.L.\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n2\n\nsin 2\u03b8\n\nFig. 9.

The\nratios of the number of events compared with no oscillations are flatter than\nin the bottom right-hand plot in Fig. 5, particularly for model LV3. We do not\nuse these spectra for the following sensitivity analysis, but it may be possible,\nwith real data, to use those spectra as well as those for numbers of events in\nterms of E/ cos \u03b8.\n\n4.3 Sensitivity regions\n\nIn the previous section, we saw how LV effects can modify the number of events\nseen in the detector and how they would modify the spectra. We now turn to\nthe discussion of the ANTARES sensitivity regions found from our numerical\nsimulations. As in the case of quantum decoherence [4], we are particularly\ninterested in finding upper bounds for the LV parameters.\n\n4.3.1 Models LV1 and LV2\nIn our first model, the LV effects are proportional to the neutrino energy. We\nfirstly consider the case in which \u2206m2 = 0, so that there are no standard\noscillations, only those which arise as a consequence of the LV effects. Fig. 9\nshows the sensitivity curves in this case. It is clear that the smallest values of\nthe LV parameter may be probed when sin2 2\u03b8 is close to one, which is the\nregion of parameter space in which we are most interested.

Sensitivity contours for model LV1 at 90 and 99% confidence level for standard oscillations plus LV effects proportional to the neutrino energy. The triangle\ndenotes the best-fit value of \u2206m2 with no LV effects [34].\n\nWe also considered the case of non-zero \u2206m2 , when standard atmospheric\nneutrino oscillations are modified by LV effects. Fig. 10 shows the sensitivity\ncontours in this case. Since we have varied three parameters (sin2 (2\u03b8), \u2206m2\nand \u2206\u03b7), we obtain a sensitivity volume. Projecting the boundary surface\nof this volume onto the co-ordinate planes gives us the sensitivity contours\nplotted in Fig. 10. As we see from Fig. 10, the experimental point of best\nfit of \u2206m2 [34], denoted by the triangle, lies within the sensitivity region.\nHowever, the region extends down to very small values of \u2206m2 and so we find\nthat our results include the previous case where neutrino oscillations arise as\na consequence of LV effects only. The top right frame in Fig. 10 shows the\nsensitivity contour for the \u2206\u03b7 as a function of the mixing angle, \u03b8. Again,\n\u2206\u03b7 = 0 is in this region, and so standard oscillations with no LV effects are\nalso included, with an upper limit shown in Table 2. This is the same order of\nmagnitude as the upper bound from Super-Kamiokande and K2K data [7,8]\nso it seems unlikely that ANTARES will be able to significantly improve on\ncurrent data.\nWe have performed a similar analysis for the model LV2, when the LV effects\n16\n\n\f\u2206\u03b7 (eV1\u2212n )\n\n\u2206\u03b7 (eV1\u2212n )\n\nPlanck scaling\n\n(\u2206m2 = 0)\n\n(\u2206m2 6= 0)\n\n(eV1\u2212n )\n\n1\n\n8.2 \u00d7 10\u221225\n\n2.9 \u00d7 10\u221224\n\nX\n\n2\n\n1.0 \u00d7 10\u221235\n\n2.9 \u00d7 10\u221235\n\n10\u221228\n\n3\n\nX\n\n6.9 \u00d7 10\u221246\n\n10\u221256\n\nn\n\nTable 2\nTable showing the upper bounds on \u2206\u03b7 contained with the sensitivity regions for\nvarious values of n.

In this case, the sensitivity\nregion again extends to both \u2206m2 = 0 and \u2206\u03b7 = 0.

If we set \u2206m2 = 0, so that oscillations\nare due to LV effects only, then we find that we are unable to derive any\nmeaningful sensitivity contours, so we do not consider this possibility further.\nFor \u2206m2 6= 0, the sensitivity contours are shown in Fig. 11. The sensitivity\ncontours in this case have a rather simpler shape than in models LV1 and\nLV2. Again the experimental point of best fit is included in the sensitivity\nregion but in this case, \u2206m2 = 0 is not included, so it seems that we are not\nsensitive to the case when oscillations arise from LV effects only for this energy\ndependence. This is in direct agreement with the first part of our analysis as we\nwere unable to find any meaningful results for this model when we considered\nLV effects only. We note however that \u2206\u03b7 = 0 is contained in the sensitivity\nregion. The upper bound on \u2206\u03b7 in this sensitivity region is given in Table 2.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion and conclusions\n\nWe have shown that neutrino telescopes, such as ANTARES, will be able to\nplace stringent bounds on LV parameters which modify the dispersion relation for massive neutrinos. Table 2 shows the upper bounds for this model\nfor the various energy dependences we have studied.

Sensitivity contours for model LV3 at 90 and 99 percent confidence level\nfor standard oscillations plus LV effects proportional to the neutrino energy cubed.\nThe triangle denotes the best-fit value of \u2206m2 with no LV effects [34].\n\neffects were proportional to either the neutrino energy or the neutrino energy squared, then we are sensitive to oscillations induced from these effects\nonly, with no contributions from standard oscillations. However, for the case\nof n = 3, then we cannot measure the effects of LV only in atmospheric neutrino oscillations. For all values of n studied, we have been able to produce\nsensitivity curves for standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations modified by\nsubdominant LV effects. We should stress that although our simulations are\nbased on the ANTARES neutrino telescope, we expect that other neutrino\ntelescopes, such as AMANDA and ICECUBE, will also be able to probe these\nmodels.\nFrom a naturalness perspective, we would expect any LV effects to be suppressed by the Planck mass, 1019 GeV. Since our LV parameters \u2206\u03b7 contain\npowers of the Planck mass already, this gives \u2206\u03b7 \u223c 10\u221228(n\u22121) eV1\u2212n for n \u2265 2.\nThese values are also given in table 2 for comparison. We note that for the case\nn = 2, the bounds obtained from our simulations surpass the expected value\nof the LV parameter by seven orders of magnitude and so ANTARES may be\nable to observe these effects or rule out this model. For the case n = 3, how18\n\n\fever, the bound from our simulations is nine orders of magnitude larger than\nexpected and so we cannot rule out this model using atmospheric neutrinos. In\nthis case better sensitivity can be obtained using higher-energy, astrophysical\nneutrinos [6]. The situation is somewhat more complicated if n = 1 as this\ncorresponds to \u03b1 = 0 in (2) and so we have no indication as to the value of \u2206\u03b7\nexcept to say that it should be small. In all three cases, we can see from table\n2 that our estimates based on the values of the LV parameters at which LV\neffects become comparable to standard neutrino oscillations are very similar\nto the upper bounds we find from our sensitivity curves.\n\nOur results for the case n = 1 are comparable with the model investigated\nin [7,8] with Super-Kamiokande and K2K data. We find that we are not able\nto significantly improve on their results; however an analysis of atmospheric\nneutrino data from ANTARES should be able to confirm their upper bounds.\nAlthough in a rather different LV model, our results are also comparable in\nmagnitude to those found by the MACRO collaboration [9]. In that paper,\nthe argument of the sine term in the oscillation probability is identical to\nthat considered here and they found an upper bound on \u2206\u03b7 in the range\n10\u221224 < \u2206\u03b7 < 10\u221226 , similar to that found here and shown in table 2.\nOur results are also comparable to those found in [27] using data from the\nAMANDA experiment. There, an upper bound of 2.1 \u00d7 10\u221227 was placed on\nthe LV parameter.\n\nIn [4], we studied in depth the spectra of numbers of events for standard atmospheric neutrino oscillations with quantum decoherence. Those spectra had\nsome of the same key features as the ones presented here in Figs. 5-8, in particular, a suppression in the expected number of atmospheric neutrino events\nobserved by ANTARES. The shape of the spectra do have some differences,\nbut it remains to be seen whether they will really be distinguishable experimentally. At this point, in the absence of real data, one can only speculate\non what might be observed, but one can foresee two possibilities. Firstly, it\nmay be that ANTARES (or any other neutrino telescope) does not observe\nany distinguishable difference in numbers of events compared with the standard atmospheric neutrino oscillation model. We argued in [4] that such a null\nobservation would be able to place very stringent bounds on quantum decoherence effects, and we draw the same conclusion here from our event spectra.\nSecondly, it may be the case that ANTARES or an equivalent neutrino telescope does indeed find evidence for a suppression in the number of events\ncompared with the standard picture. In this situation it is likely to be very\nchallenging experimentally to disentangle the possible source of new physics.\n19\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThe authors acknowledge the ANTARES Collaboration for supplying a parametrization of the response of a neutrino telescope.
