Considerable effort has been spent to understand the underlying physical mechanism behind confinement. The two most popular models, explaining\nthe physical reasons behind confinement, are the dual superconductor model [2] and the ZN\nvortex condensation model [3] [4] [5] [6].\nContinuum gauge theories require gauge fixing. On the lattice, gauge fixing is not required, but possible. In the dual superconductor model the nonabelian part of the gauge is\nfixed, while a Cartan subgroup is not. As gauge fixing leaves behind a theory with Abelian\ngauge symmetry, this is called Abelian gauge fixing. The gauge fixing procedure has defects,\nwhich can be interpreted as monopoles. The gauge field, projected to its abelian components,\nand monopoles form a Coulomb gas that confines charged objects [1].\nIn the ZN magnetic vortex model of SU(N) gauge theories the gauge is fixed completely,\nexcept for the discrete center of the group, ZN . This is called center gauge fixing. The defects\nof this gauge fixing are lines, representing magnetic fluxes, vortices, in three dimensional\nspace. The condensation and percolation of vortices can be easily shown to lead to an area\nlaw of Wilson loops, which is tantamount to confinement.\nLattice studies of abelian projected theories [7] [8] found good agreement between numerical values of gauge invariant quantities (string tension, chiral condensate, etc.) obtained\nwith and without abelian projection. This was assumed to be an indication of the validity\nof the dual superconductor picture.\nCenter projected pure lattice gauge theories [9] [10] [11] are ZN gauge theories. ZN\ngauge theories are theories of interacting vortices. Averages of Wilson loops and of other\n1\n\n\fgauge invariant quantities calculated in the projected ZN gauge theory were also in good\nagreement with numerical values of gauge invariant quantities obtained without gauge fixing.\nThis agreement implies that the center vortex picture is also a viable candidate for explaining\nconfinement.\nThe analytic study of monopoles and magnetic vortices in pure gauge theories is, however, extremely difficult. Among existing studies, Polyakov's classical Coulomb gas model\nmodel [12], and recent works defining vortices in the continuum [13] are of this nature. Strong\ncoupling expansion [14] gives credence to the vortex condensation picture, as well. The analytic study of monopoles and vortices in gauge fixed pure gauge theories is very important.\nIt is conceivable that finding an analytic proof of confinement may require an analytic proof\nof the existence and condensation of these classical objects in pure gauge theories.\nTopological solutions, such as monopoles and vortices, appear in another class of theories\nunder more controlled circumstances. Monopoles were found in Higgs theories with a single\nadjoint representation Higgs boson [15] [16] and vortices were found in Higgs theories with\ntwo or more Higgs bosons [17] [18] [19] [20], as topologically stable classical solutions.\nIn an earlier work we conjectured that monopoles and vortices found in gauge fixed pure\ngauge theories are connected with monopoles and vortices appearing as classical solitons in\nHiggs theories [21]. In this paper we intend to investigate this relationship and establish\na firm link among these objects. Using the link between gauge fixed pure gauge theories\nand of Higgs theories the properties of monopoles and vortices and their interactions can be\nstudied analytically in Higgs theories and the conclusions can be carried over to gauge fixed\npure gauge theories.\nWe will rely on lattice realizations of gauge theories and Higgs theories throughout this\npaper. We will assume that at sufficiently small gauge coupling they are close to continuum\ntheories. For the sake of simplicity we will only consider SU(2) gauge theories, but our\nconclusions can be generalized to other nonabelian gauge theories without much difficulty.\n\n2\n\nAbelian gauge fixing and Higgs theories\n\nWe will first consider Abelian gauge fixing procedures in pure lattice gauge theories. The\nmost popular gauges are the Maximal Abelian gauge (MAG) and the Laplacian Abelian\ngauge (LAG). These are opposite limits of a continuous set of gauge fixing procedures that\nwe will define below. All of these procedures use lattice gauge configurations generated\nwithout gauge fixing.\nV\nMAG is defined [7] by maximizing a functional, Sgf\n, of the gauge field over gauge transformations, V (r),\nFgf (U V ) =\n\ni\n1X h\nTr \u03c33 U\u03bcV (r)\u03c33 U\u03bcV,\u2020 (r) ,\n2 r ,\u03bc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere U\u03bcV (r) = V (r)U\u03bc (r)V (r + \u03bc). \u03bc represents a lattice vector in the direction of the \u03bcth\naxis.\nFor future purposes we rewrite Fgf (U V ) in terms of quantities defined in the adjoint\nrepresentation. As the choice of gauge is arbitrary we will choose U\u03bc (r) as a gauge field at\n2\n\n\fV\nthe maximum of Fgf (U V ), at V (r) = ei\u03b33 \u03c33 . Then we write Sgf\nas\n\nFgf (U V ) =\n\nX\n\nA\nA\ng3a\n(r)U\u03bcA,ab (r)g3b\n(r + \u03bc),\n\n(2)\n\nx,\u03bc\n\nwhere we defined the adjoint representation gauge transformation as\ni\n1 h\nA\ngab\n(r) = Tr \u03c3a V (r)\u03c3b V \u2020 (r)\n2\n\n(3)\n\nand the adjoint representation gauge field as\ni\n1 h\nU\u03bcA,ab (r) = Tr \u03c3a U\u03bc (r)\u03c3b U\u03bc\u2020 (r) .\n2\nA\ngab\nand U\u03bc (r) are orthogonal matrices. Note that the Cartan (Abelian) subgroup of the\nA\nA\ngauge group leaves the vector ga3\ninvariant. In SU(2) the normalized vector ga3\n(r) fixes only\ntwo of the parameters of the gauge group.\nP A\n(r)]2 = 1 [8]. It maximizes (2) by finding the eigenvecLAG relaxes the constraint a [ga3\ntor of largest eigenvalue of the quadratic form defined by the right hand side of (2). The local\nnormalization of the real vectors ga3 (r) then determines the gauge transformation through\n(3). The conceptual advantage of LAG over MAG is that the trajectories of monopoles can\nbe defined as singularities of the gauge fixing procedure, in agreement with the original ideas\nof 't Hooft [2]. At points where ga3 (r) vanishes the gauge transformation becomes singular.\nThese points define the world lines of monopoles in four dimensional space.\nWe introduce now a gauge, that interpolates between MAG and LAG, by defining a\nfunctional [21]\n\nZA (U V ) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nn\n\no\n\ndf (r) f 2 (r) exp \u2212F\u0303gf (U V , f ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere F\u0303gf (U V , f ) is defined as\n\u001b\ni2\ni\n1 h\n\u03bb Xh 2\nf (r)f (r + \u03bc) Tr \u03c33 U\u03bcV (r)\u03c33 U\u03bcV \u2020 (r) \u2212 f 2 (r) + 2\nf (r) \u2212 \u03b7 2 .\n2\n\u03b7 r\nr \u03bc\n(5)\nThe prescription for finding the appropriate abelian gauge is to find the maximum of\nA\nZA (U V ) in terms of the V (r) (or rather ga3\n) and f (r). The gauge defined by (4) is similar\nto the LAG gauge-fixing functional, in the sense that the optimal local vector f (r) vanishes\nat certain points (or rather, owing to three constraints, on curves in spacetime). At these\npoints the gauge transformation becomes singular. Just like in LAG, these points correspond\nto monopoles.\nNotice now that the \u03bb \u2192 \u221e limit is equivalent to MAG. Indeed, this limit freezes\nout the integration over f (r) and leaves one with the exponential of (2), multiplied by\n\u03b7 2 . Furthermore, the \u03bb \u2192 0 limit is equivalent to LAG. The introduction of the field\nf (r) is equivalent to relaxing the constraint on the magnitude of the gauge group element\nA\nA\nin adjoint representation, due to the replacement g3a\n(r) \u2192 f (r)g3a\n(r). Only the sum,\n\nF\u0303gf (U V , f ) = \u2212\n\nXX\u001a\n\n3\n\n\f2\nA 2\n2\nra f (r)(g0a ) (r) = r f (r) is restricted, to make the integral finite. The general case\nof finite \u03bb that interpolates between these two gauge fixing methods is also an appropriate\nAbelian gauge and will henceforth be called the general Abelian gauge (GAG).\nNext we propose an alternative to GAG, a conventional gauge fixing term, Sgf , inspired\nby the functional ZA (U V ) and defined as\n\nP\n\nP\n\ne\u2212Sgf (U\nwhere\neS\u0303 =\n\nV\n\nZ\n\n)\n\n= ZA (U V )e\u2212S\u0303 ,\n\n(6)\n\n\u2032\n\ndV \u2032 (r)ZA (U V ).\n\n(7)\n\nThe integral of (6) over all gauge transformations is 1 and the modified action, S = SG + Sgf ,\nleads to the same expectation value of all gauge invariant quantities as the original plaquette\naction, SG . We call this a smeared abelian gauge (SAG). Unlike in GAG, gauge configurations\nare understood to be generated in the presence of the gauge fixing term.\nIt is comparatively easy to establish the relationship between SAG and GAG. What is\nmore important this relationship extends to non-gauge invariant quantities, such as gauge\nfield configurations. Consider the Boltzmann factor in SAG,\ne\u2212SG (U\n\nV\n\n)\u2212Sgf (U V )\n\n.\n\nA\n(r) = \u03b4a3 . The integral in the denominator of (6)\nSgf (U V ) has a sharp minimum at ga3\ncan be evaluated by the saddle point method in the nonabelian parameters of the gauge\ngroup. Up to a determinant, it gives ZA (U), the maximum of the numerator of (6), over\nV (r). Though the integral of the Boltzmann factor over U\u03bc (r) is gauge invariant, ZA (U V )\nA\nwill give an appreciable contribution to the integral over U\u03bc (r) only if ga3\n(r) \u2243 \u03b4a3 . Thus,\nwhen one generates an ensemble of gauge field configurations using the Boltzmann factor\nexp{\u2212SG \u2212 Sgf } one obtains only configurations that are very close to GAG configurations.\nThe equivalence between GAG and SAG would become exact at \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e.1 In other words,\nat large \u03b7 SAG is only slightly smeared around GAG.\nWe now consider SAG from a different angle. Aside from S\u0303, the action is just that of a\ntraceless adjoint Higgs theory. To prove this statement, we use the gauge invariance of the\nmeasure, dU\u03bc (r), of SG , and of S\u0303 to introduce an extra integration over gauge transformation\nV , and write the partition function as\n\nZ=\n\nZ\n\ndV (r)\n\nZ\n\n\u2212SG (U )\u2212Sgf (U V )\n\ndU\u03bc (r)e\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndU\u03bc (r)\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6(r) e\u2212SG (U )\u2212SH (U,\u03a6)\u2212S\u0303(U ) ,\n\nwhere we defined the Higgs action as\nSH (U, \u03a6) = \u2212\n\ni\n1X h\n\u03bb X 1\nTr \u03a6(r)U\u03bc (r)\u03a6(r + \u03bc)U\u03bc\u2020 (r) \u2212 \u03a62 (r) + 2\nTr[\u03a62 (r)] \u2212 \u03b7 2\n2 r\u03bc\n\u03b7 r 2\n\u001a\n\nA\n\n1\n\n\u001b2\n\n.\n(8)\n\nOne can rescale function f by \u03b7 and then it is easy to see that all values of f and g but those maximizing\nthe gauge fixing term are frozen out.\n\n4\n\n\fHere we defined \u03a6(r) =\n\nP\n\na\n\nA\nf (r)ga3\n(r)\u03c3a and used the relationship\n\nZ\n\n2\n\ndf f (r)dV (r) \u223c\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6(r)d\u03c8(r),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c8 is the Euler angle parameterizing the little group of \u03a6(r). Consequently, the integrand is independent of \u03c8. To prove (9) we use the representation of the Haar measure by\nEuler angles and (3).\nClearly, (8) is just a standard lattice Higgs action. To show that SAG is indeed equivalent\nto a Higgs theory we only need to investigate whether the presence of the term S\u0303, defined\nin (7), changes the nature of the action.\nFirst of all, S\u0303(U) is a gauge invariant function of the gauge field, U\u03bc (r). Though it is\nnonlocal, as we will show later, it becomes local in the relevant, \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e, g \u2192 0 limit. It\nis also the generating functional of connected diagrams of an adjoint scalar field theory in\na background gauge field, U\u03bc (r). It must be composed of gauge invariant combinations of\nthe gauge field, Wilson loops. S\u0303(U) also has the property of local Z2 invariance, i.e. unlike\nthe standard plaquette action it is invariant under the local replacement U\u03bc (r) \u2192 \u2212U\u03bc (r).\nThis is the property of a gauge action with an adjoint representation trace of the plaquette\nproduct of gauge fields.\nTo investigate the behavior of S\u0303 we first use a hopping parameter expansion [22]. That\nimplies expanding Rthe integrand in the hopping term, integrating over the gauge group, and\ng\nre-exponentiating dg(r)ZH\n(\u03bb). The hopping parameter expansion assumes small \u03b7.\nThe leading nontrivial term of this expansion is\nS\u0303(U) \u2243\n\n2 4 Xh\n2 4 X\ni\n8(fav\n)\n8(fav\n)\nP\nP,A\n|U\u03bc\u03bd\n(r)|2 =\nU\u03bc\u03bd\n(r) \u2212 1\n81 r\u03bc\u03bd\n81 r \u03bc\u03bd\n\nP,A\nwhere U\u03bc\u03bd\n(r) is the plaquette in adjoint representation and\n\n2\nfav\n\n2\n\nR\u221e\n\n2\n\n2 2\n\ndf f 2 e\u2212(\u03bb/\u03b7 )(f \u2212\u03b7 )\n= R\u221e\n\u2243 \u03b72.\n\u2212(\u03bb/\u03b72 )(f 2 \u2212\u03b72 )2\ndf\ne\n0\n0\n\nThis adds a negative adjoint representation term to the usual plaquette term of the gauge\naction,\n1\n1\nP\nP\nP,A\nU\u03bc\u03bd\n(r) \u2192 2 U\u03bc\u03bd\n(r) \u2212 \u2206\u03b2A U\u03bc\u03bd\n(r),\n2\ng (a)\ng (a)\n2 4\nwhere in the leading order approximation \u2206\u03b2a = 8(fav\n) /81.\nProvided the hopping parameter expansion is convergent, higher order terms can only\nhave one of three effects:\n\n1. They can renormalize \u2206\u03b2A ,\n2. Loop terms larger than the plaquette (nonlocal terms) may appear in the adjoint\nrepresentation,\n3. Characters in higher order integer isospin representations may also appear.\n5\n\n\fLattice gauge theories with actions mixing the characters of plaquettes in fundamental and\nadjoint representations have been studied thoroughly [23]. The conclusion of those investigations is that though such a modification of the action leads to new phase transition lines\nin the space of couplings. None of those transitions is deconfining. In the continuum limit,\nwhen all couplings tend to zero, all of these theories are equivalent to a nonabelian gauge\ntheory with a modified coupling.\nIn fact, there is no real need to evaluate all these terms, as we can predict the resulting\neffective action using simple considerations. The inclusion of the gauge fixing term does\nnot change the expectation value of any gauge invariant quantity of the pure gauge theory.\nThese quantities are dependent only on the gauge coupling, or alternatively, on the scale of\nthe running coupling, g. The lattice coupling runs as\n1\n1\n\u2212\n\u2243 2\u03b2G log[\u039b(a)/\u039b0 ],\ng 2(a) g02\nwhere \u039b(a) \u223c 1/a is the lattice scale and \u03b2G = 11/24\u03c0 2; \u039b0 and g0 refer to another, fixed\nscale.\nThe action is also equivalent to an adjoint Higgs action with an effective gauge coupling\n(the modification coming from the contribution of S\u0303), geff . The effective gauge coupling is\nsuch that the inclusion of the Higgs boson changes its running into that of the non-gauge\nfixed coupling, namely\n1\n1\n\u2212 2 \u2243 2(\u03b2G + \u03b2H ) log(\u039b(a)/\u039b0),\n2\ngeff\ng0\nwhere \u03b2H = 1/24\u03c0 2 . Physical quantities, depending on the gauge field only, must be the\nsame when the Higgs theory action S = SG + S\u0303 + SH is used as when the SG action is used\nalone. As, at small g(a) these quantities are dependent only on the scale, \u039b(a), the scales in\nthe two calculation must coincide. This leads to a relationship between the effective coupling\nand the original gauge coupling\n2\ngeff\n(a) \u2243 g 2 (a)\n\n\u03b2G\n11\n= g 2 (a),\n\u03b2G + \u03b2H\n12\n\n(10)\n\nvalid at sufficiently small g(a).\nLet us return now to the discussion of the non-locality of S\u0303.2 We can show that the\nnonlocality goes away in the limit of \u03b7 \u2192 \u221e and g \u2192 0 (continuum limit), not only in the\nlimit of \u03b7 \u2192 0. This is the very limit in which SAG goes over into GAG and the lattice\ngauge theory goes over into the continuum theory. First of all, after rescaling \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6 \u03b7, we\nhave SH \u2192 \u03b7 2 S\u0303H , where S\u0303H is independent of \u03b7. As\nS\u0303 = log\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a6 e\u2212SH ,\n\nthe large \u03b7 limit is equivalent to the semiclassical limit as \u03b7 2 plays the role of 1/h\u0304. In this\nlimit only single loop terms contribute to S\u0303. In particular, all reference to the self-coupling\n2\n\nThe author is indebted to P. de Forcrand for calling his attention to this subject.\n\n6\n\n\fof the Higgs field, \u03bb, is of O(\u03b7 \u22122), as it appears in multi-loop terms only. As the external\nfields in S\u0303 are gauge fields and the internal lines are Higgs propagators (there are no internal\ngauge lines!) all the couplings of the one loop term are gauge couplings. Then the calculation\nof S\u0303 is very similar to the calculation of the running gauge coupling using the background\ngauge field method [24]. Thus, among the one loop contributions to the logarithm of the\nfunctional determinant only diagrams with at most 4 background gauge fields are divergent.\nAs it is shown on Ref. [24] the divergent contributions can be combined into the local term\n1\na 2\nlog det \u2206 = d x C(F\u03bc\u03bd\n) + finite terms ,\n4\nwhere C is a logarithmically divergent constant, depending on the transformation properties\nof the field in the loop. When the running coupling is calculated [24] one must consider the\ncontribution of the dynamical gauge field, the fermion fields, and the ghost field, as well. We\nonly need to calculate a scalar field loop, so the contribution is slightly different. We obtain\nZ\n1\n1\na 2\nd4 x(F\u03bc\u03bd\n) + terms finite at a=0,\nS\u0303 = \u2212 log(a\u039blattice )\n2\n24\u03c0 2\nwhere the scale was chosen to be \u039blattice . As in the scaling limit, the gauge coupling in the\npure gauge term scales with the lattice parameter as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n.\n=\n\u03b2\nlog\nG\ng2\na\u039blattice\nZ\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n2\nS\u0303 combines with SG to result in the replacement of g 2 by geff\n, as indicated in (10). At large\n\u03b7 and in the continuum limit the role of S\u0303 is to renormalize the gauge coupling. Then, in\nthe continuum limit, at large \u03b7, the gauge fixed pure gauge theory is indeed equivalent to a\nHiggs theory. It is clear that at smaller values of \u03b7 or/and at larger gauge coupling nonlocal\neffects are more pronounced and S\u0303 is dependent on the parameters of the Higgs potential.\nNonlocal effects are of O(1/ log(a\u039b) and of O(\u03b7 \u22122). We have also seen, however, that in the\ncontinuum limit at small \u03b7 these theories are also equivalent.\nThe equivalence of these lattice theories does not alone provide an obvious relationship\nbetween monopole configurations found in them, as the monopoles themselves are not gauge\ninvariant objects. To prove such an equivalence we need to examine not only partition\nfunctions but also Boltzmann factors.\nAssuming that the gauge coupling is small enough to apply continuum scaling, gauge\nconfigurations of the continuum theory and the lattice theory are essentially equivalent. To\nfind classical solutions of the continuum theory we need to minimize the action in terms\nof the fields. The maximum of the Boltzmann factor should be calculated by minimizing\nSG +S\u0303+SH in terms of the gauge fields and gauge transformations, as well. This minimization\nis equivalent to the minimization in terms of the Higgs field and the gauge field. In the\ncontinuum limit this minimization should lead to a combination of configurations containing\na variable number of finite energy classical solutions, monopoles [15] [16]. Monopoles are\nidentified by the radial dependence of the magnitude of the Higgs field. The magnitude of\nthe Higgs field itself is gauge invariant. The final step in identifying the monopoles with\nthose of GAG is the diagonalization of the Higgs field with a gauge transformation.\nThe conclusion of the above considerations is that\n\n7\n\n\f1. The appearance of monopoles in gauge fixed pure gauge theories follows from their\nexistence in Higgs theories.\n2. The analytic form, interaction, condensation, etc. of monopoles should be very similar\nto those in Higgs theory.\n3. The mechanism of confinement, provided monopoles are responsible for it, is the same\nin pure gauge and Higgs theories.\nBefore turning to vortices let us apply our method to calculate the distribution of a single\nmonopole in Abelian projected GAG. To do that we take the the 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole\nand diagonalize the Higgs boson by a gauge transformation. The gauge and Higgs fields are\ngiven by\nA(r) = r \u00d7 \u03c3 F (r),\n\u03a6(r) = r * \u03c3 W (r),\n\n(11)\n\nwhere F (r) and W (r) are the radial wave functions.\nThen the abelian gauge transformation is a rotation around the z axis by an angle \u2212\u03c6,\nfollowed by a rotation around the y axis by an angle \u2212\u03b8, where \u03c6 and \u03b8 are polar coordinates.\nApplying the same gauge transformation to the gauge field and projecting to the abelian\ncomponent we obtain (we set the gauge charge equal to 1)\nz\n1\nTr[\u03c3z (UA\u03bc U \u2020 + iU\u2202\u03bc U \u2020 )] = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6.\n2\nr\nThe magnetic field obtained from this vector potential is that of a single magnetic charge at\nthe origin\n1 r\u0302\nB=\n+ Dirac string.\n2 r2\nIt is worth noting that the abelian projection of gauge field (11) without abelian gauge\nfixing leads to\nA\u03bc (r) = \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 r 2F (r),\nthat is a more like a vector potential for a magnetic flux than for a monopole.\n\n3\n\nCentral gauges and Higgs theories\n\nNow we turn to center gauges and vortices. Lattice studies have shown the relevance of Z2\nvortices in pure lattice SU(2) gauge theory. These studies use two alternative gauges, the\nMaximal Center gauge (MCG) [9] and the Laplacian Center gauge (LCG) [10] [11]. The\ngauge transformations are followed by center projection.\nMCG is defined through the maximization of the following functional (we use notations,\nidentical to the ones used for the discussion of Abelian gauges) over gauge transformation\nV (x):\n#\n\" 3\nX\n1X\n1X\nV\nV\u2020\nC\nV\n2\n\u03c3i U\u03bc (r)\u03c3i U\u03bc (r) .\n(12)\nTr\nF (U) =\n|TrU\u03bc (r)| =\n4 x\u03bc\n6 r\u03bc\ni\n8\n\n\fF C (U) can be rewritten in terms of adjoint representation quantities as\nF C (U) =\n\n3\n1 XX\nA\ng A (r)U\u03bcA,ab (r)gbi\n(r + \u03bc).\n3 r \u03bc iab ai\n\n(13)\n\nIf one writes the gauge field in the canonical form\nU\u03bcg (r) = a0 + ia * \u03c3,\nwhere a20 + a2 = 1, then F C (U) = a20 . The maximization of a20 results in a gauge field\nas close to the center of the gauge group (a0 = \u00b11) as possible.\nIn fact, it is sufficient to keep only two terms of the sum over i in (12) and (13), as the\nadjoint representation gauge transformation is defined uniquely by two of the orthogonal\nA\nA\nvectors ga1\nand ga2\n. This is used in LCG, which relaxes the normalization and orthogonality\nA\nconditions on the vectors gai\n. Vortices are found at points where the two vectors are parallel.\nThese points form lines in three dimensional space. At these points the gauge transformation is singular. In what follows we will restrict ourselves to such two term gauge fixing\nfunctionals, though everything what we do can easily be generalized to the three term case,\nsuch as the original MCG.\nMCG and LCG can again be extended into a Generalized Center Gauge (GCG), which\nalso fixes the gauge, up to the center of the SU(2) gauge group, Z2 . A convenient form for\nthe gauge fixing functional is\nP\n\nZC (U V ) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a61 (r)\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\nP\n\nn\n\ndf (r) \u03c12 (x) exp \u2212F\u0303gf (U g , f ) \u2212 SH (U, \u03a61 ) \u2212 Smix (V, f, \u03a61 )\n\no\n\n(14)\n\nwhere F\u0303gf (U V , f ) and SH (U, \u03a61 ) were defined in (5) and (8), respectively, while the 'mixing\nterm' is given by\n\u03bb\u0303 X\nA\n[f (r)ga3\n(r)\u03a61a (r) \u2212 c\u03b7 2 ]2 ,\nSmix (V, f, \u03a61 ) = 2\n\u03b7 r\n\nA\nwhere c is the cosine of the asymptotic angle between ga3\nand \u03a6a . When we maximize (14)\nin terms of V (r) and f (r) we obtain an abelian gauge. The exponent will be dominated\nby the configuration of the Higgs field, gauge transformation, and f (r) that maximizes the\nexponent. In contrast to the Abelian gauge fixing of the previous section this limit fixes the\nabelian gauge group, as well. The Abelian subgroup is fixed by a rotation around the 3rd\nA\naxis (the little group of ga3\n(r)), such that \u03a612 (r) = 0. Vortices appear on lines in the 3D space\n1\nA\nwhere \u03a6a (r) is parallel with ga3\n(r) and where such a gauge fixing is impossible. Alternatively,\nin a slightly more symmetric manner, we could also define the gauge transformation by\nrotating the sum of the normalized Higgses parallel to the z axis and rotating the difference\ninto the (xz)-plane.\nWhen c = 0 and \u03bb, \u03bb\u0303 \u2192 \u221e GCG reduces to MCG (or rather an analogous 2 term gauge),\nA\nas \u03a61a (r) is kept normalized to \u03b7 and orthogonal to ga3\n(r). When \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 0 GCG reduces\nto LCG.\nNext we introduce the smeared center gauge (SCG) such that the gauge fixing term in\nthe Lagrangian is defined as\ne\u2212Sgf = ZC (U g )e\u2212S\u0304 ,\n\n9\n\n\fwhere\neS\u0304 =\n\nZ\n\n\u2032\n\ndV \u2032 (r)ZC (U V )\n\nIn a manner similar to our discussion of Abelian gauges we can show that on large lattices\nSCG is very close to GCG and we can also show that SCG is completely equivalent to a lattice\nHiggs theory with two adjoint Higgses. This follows because after a gauge transformation\none can introduce the second Higgs field as\nA\n\u03a62a (r) = V (r)ga3\n(r)\n2\n2\nand prove that the action can be written as S = SG + Sgf = SG + S\u0304 + SH\n, where SH\nis a Lagrangian for two adjoint Higgses. SG + S\u0304 is again a modified pure gauge action.\nThe modified gauge coupling should be equal to the standard pure gauge coupling minus\nthe contribution of two adjoint Higgs bosons, as S is equivalent to a gauge fixed version\n2\nof the pure gauge theory. Thus the relationship between the gauge couplings is geff\n(a) \u2243\n2\n(11/13)g (a).\nThe Boltzmann factor of the GCG must be dominated by vortex configurations, if the\nBoltzmann factor of the Higgs theory is. To make the connection between GCG and SCG\ndistributions we need to fix the vortex gauge such that one of the Higgs bosons is rotated\nparallel to the 3rd axis in isospace while the second Higgs boson is rotated into the 1\u22123 plane.\nThus, the 'thick' vortices appearing in GCG have the same location and radial dependence\nas the vortices of the Higgs theory.\nTo illustrate the equivalence of GCG and SCG we calculate the shape of a single vortex\nin center gauge fixed pure gauge theory, by making use of a classical solution of the Higgs\ntheory with two adjoint Higgs bosons [21]. The solution is of the form\n\n\u03a61,2 (r) = U(\u03c6)[\u03c7d (\u03c1)\u03c33 \u00b1 \u03c7\u22a5 (\u03c1)\u03c31 ]U \u2020 (\u03c6),\nA\u03bc (r) = a(\u03c1)\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u03c33 ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere the boundary conditions require that \u03c7\u22a5 (0) = a(0) = 0 and a(\u221e) = 1, the topological\ncharge. \u03c1 and \u03c6 are cylindrical coordinates, along with z and\nU(\u03c6) = ei\u03c6\u03c33 /2 .\nThe normalized\ncomponents of q\nthe Higgs field also satisfy boundary conditions at infinity:\nq\n\u03c7\u22a5 (\u221e) = (1 \u2212 c)/2, \u03c7d (\u221e) = (1 + c)/2. c is the angle between the two Higgs bosons at\ninfinity. (15) satisfies the constraint that the two Higgs fields become parallel at the location\nof the vortex, along the z axis. The z axis is also the locus of the singularity of U(\u03c6).\nTo predict the form of a thick vortex on the lattice, in pure gauge theory, we need to\nbring the Higgs bosons to a standard form. This is the form in which the fields have only\ncomponents in the (xz) plane and the sum of the Higgses is diagonal. To get to that form\nwe need to use the singular gauge transformation U \u2020 (\u03c6). As U commutes with the gauge\nfield of (15) the only change of the gauge field will be the addition of the inhomogeneous\nterm, iU \u2020 \u2202\u03bc U. This will result in the following change in the gauge field (the gauge charge\nhas been set equal to unity):\nA\u03bc (r) \u2192 A\u03bc (r) + iU \u2020 \u2202\u03bc U = [a(\u03c1) \u2212 1]\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u03c33 .\n10\n\n\fThe gauge field remains diagonal after the\n\u221a gauge transformation. It is singular on the z-axis\nand it goes to zero exponentially at \u03c1 = x2 + y 2 \u2192 \u221e.\nTo understand what happens on the lattice and after center projection we rewrite the\nHiggs fields, the vector potential, and the gauge transformation into a form appropriate for\nthe lattice. The Higgs field (15) is already in such a form. The lattice gauge field is a unitary\nmatrix. The gauge field in (15) can be conveniently written as\nU\u03bc (r) = exp\n\n\u001a\n\ni\na(\u03c1(r))[\u03c6(r + \u03bc) \u2212 \u03c6(r)]\u03c33 ,\n2\n\u001b\n\n(16)\n\nwhere \u03c1(r) and \u03c6(r) are the cylindrical coordinates at lattice points. The singular gauge\ntransformation that brings the Higgs field into the (xz) plane is\ni\nV (r) = exp \u03c6(r) .\n2\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n\nThus, the gauge transformed gauge field is\nU\u03bcV\n\ni\n(r) = V (r)U\u03bc (r)V (r + \u03bc) = exp [a(\u03c1(r)) \u2212 1][\u03c6(r + \u03bc) \u2212 \u03c6(r)]\u03c33 .\n2\n\u001a\n\n\u2020\n\n\u001b\n\nLet us examine the gauge field near the z axis. At \u03c1 \u223c 0 the radial component of the\noriginal gauge field is negligible, a(\u03c1) \u223c \u03c12 , and the new gauge field has the form of a pure\ngauge transformation. When one traverses around the z axis one needs to define a surface\nin the three dimensional space, with a boundary at the z axis, such that on this surface the\nvalue of \u03c6(x) jumps by 2\u03c0. This surface can be chosen arbitrarily, so we choose the half-(xz)\nplane containing the negative half of the x axis. If the gauge coupling small, the argument\nof the gauge field U\u03bc (x) is small and at central projection projects to the identity matrix.\nWhen we intersect the half plane, however,\ni\n\nUy (r) \u2243 e 2 [\u03c0\u2212(\u2212\u03c0)] = \u22121,\nand the gauge field projects to the non-trivial element of the center, -1. This sheet of negative\nelements of the center ends in the z-axis, where a Z2 vortex appears. Thus, we showed that\nin the center gauge, after center projection a Zn vortex appears wherever a vortex appears\nin the Higgs theory. At the same time we have given a representation for the thick vortex,\nobtained after transformation to center gauge, but before center projection.\nStrictly speaking, a secondary vortex also appears at some distance from the z axis. The\nlocation of that vortex is determined by the equation\n1\na(\u03c1) \u2212 1 \u2243 ,\n2\nwhich ensures that the jump of the argument of U\u03bc is smaller than \u03c0/2. At large \u03c1 the radial\ncomponent of the gauge field a(\u03c1) \u223c e\u2212mA \u03c1 , where the auxiliary gauge mass, mA = g(a)\u03b7.\nThen the secondary vortex will appear at \u03c1 \u223c 1/mA . If, in the continuum limit, g(a)\nis sufficiently small then this vortex will be far away from the z axis, not affecting the\n11\n\n\fconfinement picture. The location of the primary vortex is gauge invariant and of the\nsecondary vortex depends on the gauge. On the contrary, if we perform the center projection\nwithout transforming (15) to center gauge, then the Z2 vortex does not appear at the z axis,\nwe would only have the above described secondary vortex and the simple vortex condensation\npicture would not be recognizable.\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have shown that pure gauge theories in Abelian or Center gauges are equivalent to Higgs\ntheories with one or more adjoint representation Higgs bosons. The equivalence extends to\ngauge configurations. Monopoles and vortices and their interactions, condensation, etc. in\ngauge fixed pure gauge theories can be studied analytically by investigating similar objects\nin Higgs theories, where they appear as classical solutions.\nWe encounter a problem when we apply our method of connecting pure gauge theories\nwith Higgs theories in the limiting cases of Maximal Abelian and Maximal Center gauges.\nThen our construction leads to gauged nonlinear sigma models. As far as we know, the\nrelevant gauged nonlinear sigma models do not have classical solutions in 3+1 dimensions.\nThe reason is simple: Higgs fields in nonlinear sigma models cannot vanish. In gauged\nlinear sigma models the location of the zeros marks the center of monopoles or vortices.\nThis is, of course, in agreement with the fact that monopoles and vortices do not appear as\nsingularities of the gauge transformation in MAG and MCG either. It would be interesting\nto investigate, using nonlinear sigma models, why the projected theories still show many of\nthe characteristics found in General Abelian and General Center gauges.\nThe link between gauge fixed pure gauge theories and Higgs theories can be employed\nto investigate important questions concerning confinement. One example that comes to\nmind is the recently uncovered intriguing relationship between monopole and vortex condensations [25] [26]. Simulations show that monopoles do not form a Coulomb gas as was\noriginally assumed, but rather they line up to form vortices, thereby making vortices more\nfundamental for the mechanism of confinement.\nAnother important question is why multiple non-abelian vortex configurations appear\nat all. 't Hooft's argued [27] that in a SU(2)/Z2 theory the homotopy group has only one\nnon-trivial class, so vortices should coalesce into a single vortex or no vortex at all. The\nsituation is somewhat different in U(1) gauge theory where the homotopy group is Z, and\ninfinitely many kinds of vortices exist. Lattice evidence supports, however, the existence of\nmulti-vortex configurations. It is conceivable that studying interactions of vortices in Higgs\ntheories one will be able to answer this important question, as well.\nThe author thanks the U.S. Department of Energy for partial support through grant\n#DE FG02-84ER-40153.\n\nReferences\n[1] See e.g. M.
