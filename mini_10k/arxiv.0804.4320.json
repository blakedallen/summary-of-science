We discuss features of charmonium suppression at s = 200 GeV within\nthe framework of the Glauber-Gribov theory and the comovers interaction model. The\nlatter approach has been extended by allowing for secondary charmonium production\ndue to recombination of cc\u0304 pairs in the medium, estimated from pp data at the same\nbombarding energy. Centrality and rapidity dependence of the nuclear modification\nfactor for J/\u03c8 in d+Au, Cu+Cu and Au+Au collisions at RHIC are reproduced\nwithout fitting a single model parameter. A strong suppression of J/\u03c8 is predicted for\nLHC energies.\n\nPACS numbers: 13.85.-t, 24.85.+p, 25.75.-q, 25.75.Cj\n\n1. Introduction\nCharmonium production off nuclei is one of the most promising probes for studying\nthe properties of matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. It was realized\nlong time ago, that only collisions where a large density of particles is produced in the\ncentral region give rise to an anomalous J/\u03c8 suppression, i.e. above the one observed\nin pA collisions. The anomalous suppression was advocated as a signal of charmonium\nmelting in a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, but can also be described as a final state\ninteraction of the J/\u03c8 with co-moving matter, of both partonic and hadronic nature,\nsee e.g. [1, 2]. At RHIC, charmonium has been measured for several collision systems\nand both at forward and mid-rapidities, and hence provide unique insights into the\nproduction and interaction of charmonium in nuclear environments at very high energies.\nWe present an approach based on Glauber-Gribov theory, which encompasses\nseveral nuclear effects for J/\u03c8 suppression in dA collisions, supplemented with additional\n\u2021 Unit\u00e9 Mixte de Recherche UMR n\u25e6 8627 - CNRS\n\n\fCharmonium dynamics in dA and AA at RHIC and LHC\n\n2\n\ninteraction with comovers in the final state in AA, which also allows for secondary J/\u03c8\nproduction from recombination.\n2. Baseline: charmonium in dA collisions\n\nRpA\n\nAt lower energies, nuclear suppression of charmonium in pA collisions was attributed\nto the successive interaction of the produced J/\u03c8 (or, rather, the pre-resonant cc\u0304 pair)\nwith the surrounding nuclear matter. In the Glauber model, this mechanism could be\n\u03c8\nquantified by an absorptive cross section, \u03c3abs\n, which was found to be about 5 mb at\n\u221a\ns = 19 GeV [3]. Within this semiclassical picture, most models predicted a growth of\nabsorption with energy, see e.g. [4]. On the contrary, measurements of J/\u03c8 production\nin d+Au collisions at RHIC [5, 6] revealed a significant reduction of nuclear absorption\ncompared to measurements at lower energies.\nThe RHIC results signal a breakdown of the semiclassical probabilistic picture of\nordered multiple scattering, and is in line with predictions from the relativistic GlauberGribov theory of nuclear interactions [8, 9]. Above a certain critical energy EM the\nincoming hadron can fluctuate into a state containing the both heavy cc\u0304 state and\nlight quarks and gluons long before the collision with the nucleus takes place. In the\ncoherent limit, both the soft partons of the fluctuation and the heavy cc\u0304 system itself\ncan interact almost simultaneously with several nucleons in the target. Schematically,\nthe former process leads to shadowing of nuclear parton densities and dominates at\nmid-rapidity while the latter imposes limits from energy-momentum conservation in\nthe forward region. In other words, the diagrams involving multiple scattering ordered\nin the longitudinal direction, the so-called Glauber-type diagrams, are suppressed at\nE > EM and hence nuclear absorption drops out. Note, that we do not assume any\ndiminution of the absorptive cross section.\nWe refer to [10, 11] for further details on the Glauber-Gribov theory and analysis\nof RHIC data.

This constitutes\nthe baseline in the search for the origin of anomalous suppression in AA collisions.\n3. Charmonium recombination and dissociation in AA\nOne finds a large density of particles in central AA collisions at RHIC. In addition to the\nnuclear effects present in the smaller pA collisions described above, one should also take\ninto account the possible interaction of J/\u03c8's with co-moving matter produced in the\ncollision. This interaction can be quantified by a simple rate equation which, assuming\nboost-invariant longitudinal expansion, takes the form\nh\ni\ndNJ/\u03c8\n= \u2212\u03c3co N co NJ/\u03c8 \u2212 Nc Nc\u0304 ,\n(1)\n\u03c4\nd\u03c4\nwhere N co , NJ/\u03c8 and Nc(c\u0304) denote the density of comovers, hidden and open charm at\nthe impact parameter of the initially produced J/\u03c8, respectively. The first term in (1)\nis responsible for charmonium dissociation while the second gives rise to secondary J/\u03c8\nproduction due to recombination. The interaction cross section \u03c3co was found at SPS\nto be 0.65 mb in a model where charmonium recombination was neglected due to the\nsmall density of open charm [13].\nCalculations including both terms in (1) and the same \u03c3co were presented in [14].\nThe density of charmonium and open charm at RHIC was inferred from measurements in\npp collisions at the same energy [15, 16] (the density of open charm at forward rapidity\nwas taken from PYTHIA). Results for J/\u03c8 suppression in Au+Au collisions at both\nmid- and forward rapidities (\u03b7 = 2.2) at RHIC are compared to experimental data [7]\nin figure 2. Note, that no parameters were fitted to obtain such good agreement with\nthe experimental data. In particular, the stronger suppression at forward rapidities is\na result of strong initial state suppression and smaller recombination. Calculations for\nCu+Cu collisions at the same energy are also matching the experimental data. We refer\nto [14] for further details of the calculation.\n\n\fRPb+Pb\n\nCharmonium dynamics in dA and AA at RHIC and LHC\n\n1.4\n\n4\n\nshadowing\nC = 0 - no recombination\nC=2\nC = 3.5\nC=5\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\ns = 5500 GeV\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\nNpart\n\nFigure 3. Predictions for the centrality dependence of J/\u03c8 suppression at mid-rapidity\nin Pb+Pb collisions at LHC.\n\n\u221a\nRecombination effects will be of crucial importance in Pb+Pb collisions at s = 5.5\nTeV. Predictions for J/\u03c8 suppression at LHC have been made assuming d\u03c3cc\u0304 /dy \u2248 1 mb\nat mid-rapidity and the non-diffractive pp cross section \u03c3pp = 59 mb [14], with \u03c3co kept\nfixed. This corresponds to C = 2.5 in figure 3. In our model, this stands for four\ntimes stronger recombination effects at LHC than at RHIC. The strong and almost\nimpact parameter independent J/\u03c8 suppression is mainly due to strong initial state\ngluon shadowing, depicted with a dotted curve in figure 3, and because of a large density\nof comovers leading to strong dissociation. This is in stark contrast to predictions of\nenhanced production of J/\u03c8 obtained in a model assuming thermalization of the heavy\nquarks with the entire partonic system formed at a given impact parameter [17].\nReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n\nBrodsky S J and Mueller A H 1988 Phys.
