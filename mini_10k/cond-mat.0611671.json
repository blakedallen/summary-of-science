A quantitative characterization of energy dissipation channels in the peapod pair\nhas been performed via molecular dynamics simulation. Edge effects are found to the\ndominant cause of dynamic friction in the carbon-peapod oscillators. A comparative\nstudy on energy dissipation also reveals significant impact of temperature and impulse\nvelocity on the frictional force.\n\n1\n\n\fNanoscale fabrication technologies have made pervasive impact in the past 20 years1.\nOne of the manifestations has been in the area of nano-electro-mechanical-systems\n(NEMS)2, which broadly refers to the application of nano-fabrication technologies to\nconstruct sensors, actuators, and nano-scale integrated systems for a variety of\napplications. Very recently, Zettl's group reported that frictional forces are very small,\nc.a. in the magnitude of 10-14 N per \u00c52, during the controlled and reversible telescopic\nextension of multi-wall carbon nanotubes3. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the\ntransit time for complete nanotube core retraction (on the order of 1 to 10 ns) implies the\npossibility of exceptionally fast electromechanical switches4. In fact, oscillating crystals\nhave a long history, dating back to 1880 when the piezoelectric effect was discovered by\nthe Curie brothers5. Quartz crystal oscillators are widely used to provide regular pulses to\nsynchronize various parts of an electronic system. But a typical crystal is millimeters in\nsize, which could not be directly integrated into a computer chip. Motivated by the\nobservation of Zettl's group's, Zheng and Jiang4 proposed a new type of nano-oscillators\noperating completely differently from conventional quartz oscillators. Since then,\ndesigning this type of nano-oscillator has been carried out actively. Legoas and\ncollaborators6 first simulated an 38-GHz nano-oscillator consisting of a (9,0) carbon\nnanotube (CNT) inside of an (18,0) CNT. Zhao et al 7 found that off-axial rocking motion\nof the inner nanotube and wavy deformation of the outer nanotube are responsible for\nenergy dissipation in a double-walled nanotube oscillator.\n\nSo far, no successful experimental realization of the bi-tube oscillators has been reported.\nThis is probably due to the considerable amount of energy dissipation, and the difficulty\nof preparing bi-tube type oscillator unit from multi-wall carbon nanotubes with high\nquality. Fortunately, we have effective ways to place buckyballs inside nanotubes. For\ninstance, single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) can be synthesized by pulsed-laser\nvaporization route, whereby the sublimation of solid C60 in the presence of open SWNT\ncauses the fullerenes to enter SWNT and self-assemble into 1D chains8. Therefore, it is\nfeasible for single C60 to enter nanotube by van der Walls interactions. The peapod\nformation process has been widely studied9-12. Many studies are also focused on the\neffect of the nanotube diameter on binding properties9, 10. Filling SWNT with C60 is\n\n2\n\n\fexothermic or endothermic depending on the size of the nanotube. C60@(10,10) is found\nto be stable (exothermic) while other peapods with smaller radius such as the (9,9) and\n(8,8) tubes are endoethermic10. Among many proposed interesting applications of peapod\nstructures, one recent nanomechanical resonance study has been performed on C60-filled\ncarbon nanotube bundles towards developing next generation resonating systems13. The\ntopic of this article is another feasible application of carbon-peapod system. Comparing\nwith bi-tube structure models, here we propose that it is much more practical to replace\nthe inner tube with a buckyball since the dynamic friction force between two objects is\nindeed proportional to the area of the overlapping sections from the perspective of\nmodern tribology. Similar carbon-peapod osillators were investigated previously14,\n\n15\n\n,\n\nfocusing on elastic properties14 and length-dependent oscillating frequencies15. It was\nalso found that the frictional behavior of the carbon peapod depends on the diameter and\nchirality of the nanotube15. However, little attention has been paid so far to detailed\nenergy dissipation mechanisms in the carbon-peapod oscillators. It is the aim of this\narticle to investigate energy dissipation channels and effects of temperature and impulse\nvelocity in the peapod oscillators via molecular dynamics simulation.\n\nThe structure model consists of one (10,10) SWNT of length 50.05\u00c5 with one C60\nmolecule inside. The edges of SWNT are passivated with hydrogen atoms. The diameter\nof C60 is 6.83\u00c5, which fits nicely into (10,10) tube with a diameter 13.56\u00c5 (see Fig. 1).\nThe force field used here for sp2 carbon centers was developed by fitting experimental\nlattice parameters, elastic constants and phonon frequencies for graphite16. This force\nfield uses Lennard-Jones 12-6 van der Waals interactions (Rv = 3.8050, Dv = 0.0692),\nMorse bond stretches (Rb = 1.4114, kb = 720, Db = 133.0), cosine angle bends (\u03b8a = 120,\nk\u03b8\u03b8 = 196.13, kr\u03b8 =-72.41, krr = 68), and a twofold torsion (Vt = 21.28), where all\ndistances are in \u00c5, angles in degrees, energies and force constants in kcal/mol. This force\nfield correctly predicts that the energetically favorable packing for C60 is face-centered\ncubic and for C70 is hexagonal close-packing (h.c.p.). A more interesting result relevant\nto this work is the good agreement of the sublimation energy between calculation (40.9\nkcal/mol at 739 K) and measurement (40.1 + 1.3 kcal/mol at 739 K)16. This force field is\nemployed here to study the binding energy Eb\n\n3\n\n\fE =E\n\u2212E\n\u2212 Ec\nb\nc @(10,10)\n(10,10)\n60\n60\n\n(Eq. 1).\n\nIt is expected that buckyball molecules are more attracted to a SWNT than to each other\ndue to a larger contact area with SWNTs, and therefore, more carbon-carbon van der\nWaals interactions. Once a fullerene enters a nanotube, the van der Waals attraction\nkeeps it inside. From our force-field parameters, the binding energy is \u2013 81.4 kcal/mol for\nputting one C60 inside a (10,10) SWNT, which is consistent with previous results reported\nby the Girifalco group17 and Ulbricht et al11. However, the reported binding energies by\nOkada et al10 (c.a. \u201311.8 kcal/mol) and the Louie group12 (c.a. \u201323.1 kcal/mol) are\ndifferent from the above results, which is not surprising as it is well-known that longrange attractive (London dispersion) interactions are not adequately described by the\nDFT methods18 based on the local density approximation and the generalized gradient\napproximation..\n\nAs a preparation, our system is first equilibrated at 120K, 180K, 240K, 300K, and 360K\nwith the NVT dynamics for 30 ps. After an impulse velocity is added to buckyball,\ndynamics simulation is carried out with the thermostat only attached to the tube. It is\nclear that the total energy of the C60@(10,10) system is not conserved. It is desirable to\nstudy the energy dissipation channels which allow energy flow from buckyball to tube,\nand then to the thermostat.\n\nThe tube serves as a potential well to confine the motion of the ball. It is easy to estimate\nthe\n\nmaximally-allowed\n\nrelation v max = 2 E b\n\nmc60\n\nimpulse\n\nvelocity,\n\nwhich\n\nis\n\n960\n\nm/s,\n\nusing\n\nthe\n\n. In our simulation, the C60 molecule is given an initial\n\ntranslational velocity of 480 m/s. Various impulse velocities between 100 m/s and 700\nm/s also have been applied for T = 300K in order to study the relation between the\ndynamic friction force and the initial velocity. Kinetic energy data of the buckyball from\nthe molecular dynamics simulation are smoothened by averaging over every five time\nperiods (see Fig. 2a). As the buckyball moves to the opening end of the tube, it is slowed\ndown until the translational velocity vanishes thanks to the van der Waals attraction\n\n4\n\n\fbetween tube and ball. At this moment, the potential energy reaches its local maximum,\nafter which the ball returns back to the tube (see Fig. 2b and 2c). The period is 20 ps,\ncorresponding to a frequency of 50GHz, which is quite encouraging for its potential\napplications to the nano-fabrication field.\n\nIn this system, there are two important channels for energy dissipation: off-axial wavy\nmotion and the edge effect. The former means that the ball moves off-axially inside the\ntube; the latter refers to the case when the ball moves to the edges of the tube.\nMacroscopic models of friction between solids dictate that friction is proportional to\nnormal force, independent of contact area. This is so-called Amontons's law. For\ndynamic friction force, Coulomb's law states that it is independent of velocity. It is\ninteresting to note that recent experiments19-21 by atomic force microscope (AFM)22\nsuggest that microscopic friction does not always behave according to traditional\nAmontons's law and Coulomb's law, thereby suggesting the need for new laws that\naccount for atomic scale phenomena23, 24. So far, both area and velocity dependences\nhave been demonstrated. It should be emphasized that edge effects should be paid more\nattention at nanoscale. This will be illustrated further in this Letter.\n\nThe dynamic friction force can be readily computed from the energy data\nf =\u2212\n\n\u0394E\n,\n\u0394l\n\n(Eq. 2)\n\nwhere \u0394l is the distance the buckyball travel while its kinetic energy is decreased by an\namount \u0394E. Comparing with previous studies on double-walled oscillators, here only the\ntube is attached to the thermostat, a setting arguably more convenient to study energy\ndissipation in nanotube oscillators. Under this circumstance, the simulation yields the\nupper bound of dynamic friction force. It is interesting to compare the dynamic friction\nforce at 300K evaluated in this study with those from the literature. In Zettl's paper, the\ndynamic friction force per area is estimated to be less than 4.3 x 10-15 N/\u00c52. In our study,\nthis dynamic friction force is 0.17 pN, which is far less than that in bi-tube-like system\n(usually in the magnitude of nN). Note that the contact area between ball and tube is 97.9\n\n5\n\n\f\u00c52. This means the dynamic friction force per unit area of our system is 1.8 x 10-15 N/\u00c52\nwhich contains contributions from both the off-axial motion and the edge effects.\n\nWe now address the temperature effect on dynamic friction. The results, plotted in Fig.\n3a and 3b, show that the dynamic friction force increases as the raising temperature. The\nsource of this dynamic friction is the energy flow from the ball to the tube. This is caused\nby both the off-axial motion between the ball and the tube, and the edge effects. We\ndefine the off-axial angle, \u03b8, of buckyball with respect to the tube as\nv v\n\u22121 abs ( r1 \u2022 r2 )\n\u03b8 = cos ( v\n(Eq. 3).\nv ),\n| r1 | \u00d7 | r2 |\nv\nv\nwhere r1 is the vector from origin to the center of ball, r2 is the axial vector from origin to\nthe right edge of tube, abs means taking absolute value so that the value of \u03b8 is in the\nfirst quadrant (see Fig. 3c). No constraint is applied on the shape of the SWNT during the\nsimulation. Indeed, there exists an energy transfer channel via the coupling between the\noff-axial wavy motion of the buckyball and the radial breathing mode of the SWNT. At\nthe atomic scale, the shape of SWNT cannot be perfectly rigid due to thermal vibrations.\nEspecially, when the buckyball moves near the edges of the SWNT, the axial vector of\nSWNT tilts away by about 0.4o from x-axis (assuming the SWNT initially is aligned\nalong the x-axis). Thus, this variation should be taken into account. In practice, we use\nthe mass center of the right edge of tube as the reference point to compute the axial\nvector, and then calculate the off-axial angle based on Eq. 3 for each ps during the\nsimulation. The average off-axial angles tabulated in Table 1 are analyzed following this\nprocedure. In Table (1.a), the average off-axial angles for different temperatures with a\nfixed impulse velocity (v = 480m/s) are collected. There is a clear trend that \u03b8 increases\nmonotonically with the temperature, indicating that the ball takes on larger off-axial\nmotion at higher temperatures which leads to higher energy dissipation. In addition, the\nenergy transfer between the ball and the tube at the tube edges is also enhanced.\nTherefore, the dynamic friction force increases (see Fig. 3a). In this case, the\ncontributions to dynamic friction from two dissipation channels are mixed together.\nHowever, as we stated before, when the buckyball moves near the edges of the SWNT\n(see Fig. 3d), there is significant energy transfer between them. Therefore, we must study\n\n6\n\n\fquantitatively energy dissipation due to the edge effect. To do this, we have examined the\nrelation between the dynamic friction force and the impulse velocity in this system by\nvarying impulse velocities (between 100 m/s and 700 m/s) at T = 300K. The results are\nplotted in Fig. 3b. Indeed, the velocity dependence of dynamic friction has been reported\nby Gnecco et al21 for a silicon tip sliding on a NaCl(100) surface. In our simulation, the\nvelocity is in the order of 102 m/s, which is ten orders of magnitude higher than those in\nGnecco et al's paper21. Thus, we are in two completely different velocity regimes. In\naddition, the friction force calculated here arises from smooth sliding between a\nbukcyball and the inner walls of a SWNT without applied normal forces, while in Gnecco\net al's paper, strong forces are applied between the tip and the NaCl (100) surface.\nConsequently, a direct comparison can not be made. However, good agreement has been\nfound between this work and another earlier computational study7 on the value of\nfrictional forces per atom. In our model it is interesting to note that the average off-axial\nangles are little influenced by impulses for a given temperature, for example, 300K (see\nTable (1b)). Since the frictional force increases with the impulse velocity as shown in\nFig. 3b, it follows that this velocity dependence is mainly due to energy dissipation at the\nedges of the tube (not due to off-axial motion), and the larger impulse velocity, the more\nenergy dissipation at the edges of the tube. More importantly, we can extract the dynamic\nfriction force due to off-axial wavy motion at 300K by simply extrapolating the data to\nzero impulse velocity. It yields a friction force of about 12 fN due to the off-axial wavy\nmotion. For comparison, the contribution from the edge effects (158 fN) with an impulse\nvelocity of 480m/s is about one order of magnitude larger than wavy motion at 300K\nwith the same impulse velocity. This is supported by a recent independent study by\nTangney et al25.\n\nTo conclude, we have carried out a quantitative characterization of dominant energy\ndissipation mechanisms for a carbon peapod nano-oscillator that can be realized in the\nlab. Our molecular dynamics simulation results reveal significant effects of the\ntemperature and the impulse velocity on friction. In particular, it has been shown that the\nedge effects are the main cause of the dynamic friction force. This novel nano-oscillator\n\n7\n\n\fdesign proposed here holds great promise for applications in NEMS owing to its\nextremely low operating friction and easy adaption for impulse generation26.\n\nAcknowledgement\nH.B.S. is grateful for kind assistances in coding from Y.

This heterofullerene ion is formed in the gap phase during fast atom\nbombardment of a cluster-opened N-methoxyethoxy methyl ketolactam27. It is\npossible to use same approach to put NC59+ inside SWNT as assembling C60 with\nSWNT. Then applying E-field can generate proper amount of momentum for\nNC59+ as initial impulse. For practical consideration, NC59+ can be stabilized in\ngas phase with nitrogen atmosphere.\n\n9\n\n\f27\n\nFor instance, see J. C. Hummelen et al, Science 269, 1554 (1995); and J.
