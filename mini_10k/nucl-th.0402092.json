The scattering amplitude depends on the square of the charge of a struck\nquark, and so provides a ground-state to ground-state matrix element that is different than\nthe ones involved in the electromagnetic form factors[3].\nOne primary goal has been to determine the dominant reaction mechanism that allows the\nproton to accommodate the large momentum transfer while remaining a proton. According\nto perturbative QCD (pQCD)[4, 5] the three active valence quarks share the momentum\ntransfer via the exchange of two gluons that each carry a large momentum. In the pQCD\ntreatment, hard gluon exchanges are included in an effective current operator, and so can\nbe taken to occur within the time duration of the reaction. The most recent calculations\n[6] find that this mechanism yields cross sections that are about 10 times smaller than ones\nmeasured at photon energies of 6 GeV or less. Another approach uses overlaps of soft\nnon-perturbative wave functions[7, 8]. As noted in the review[9], the invariant amplitude\nis obtained by evaluating the so-called handbag diagrams of Fig. 1. The large momentum\ntransfer occurs on a single quark, with a probability amplitude determined by the overlap of\nthe initial and final state wave functions. Here the high momentum transfer is accommodated\nby the exchange of an uncountable number of gluons that occurs either before and after the\nreaction takes place. Such calculations have had reasonable success in reproducing the\nmeasurements [8, 10].\nPrevious treatments of the handbag diagram[7, 8] have provided a unifying relation between elastic form factors, real Compton scattering and virtual Compton scattering. This\napproach has led to interesting predictions that are testable experimentally. Our concern\nhere is with understanding the limitations of the approximations. One involves asserting that\nthe longitudinal momentum of the proton is carried by a single quark[8]. Another involves\nthe neglect of the effects of hadron helicity flip[7, 8] in high momentum transfer exclusive\nreactions. A specific consequence is that the observables KLL (which involves the helicity of\nthe final proton) and ALL (which involves the helicity of the initial proton) are predicted to\nbe the same. Ref. [10] includes corrections that allow photon and proton helicity flip.\nOur purpose here is to use a model wave function that provides a reasonably good description of all four nucleon electromagnetic form factors[11, 12, 13] to evaluate the graphs of\nFig. 1 in a manner that avoids neglecting the effects of hadronic helicity non-conservation.\nThe essential feature is that relativistic and quark mass effects induce significant quark\ntransverse and orbital angular momentum that cause violations of hadronic helicity conser-\n\n2\n\n\fTABLE I: Different parameter sets, m, \u03b2 in fm\u22121 .

[11, 12, 13]. This model starts with a wave function for 3 relativistic constituent\nquarks:\n\u03a8(pi ) = u(p1 )u(p2 )u(p3)\u03c8(p1 , p2 , p3 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere pi represents space, spin and isospin indices: pi = pi si , \u03c4i and repeated indices are\nsummed over. The spinors u are canonical Dirac spinors. The components of momenta are\n+\n2\n2\nexpressed in terms of light cone notation: pi \u2261 (p+ , p\u22a5 )i , with p\u2212\ni = (p\u22a5 i + m )/pi . The\nthree momenta pi of the quarks can be transformed to the total and relative momenta to\nP\n+\n+\nfacilitate the separation of the center of mass motion as P = i pi , \u03be = p+\n1 /(p1 + p2 ), \u03b7 =\n+\n+\n+\np1 + p2 /P , k\u22a5 = (1 \u2212 \u03be)p1\u22a5 \u2212 \u03bep2\u22a5 , K\u22a5 = (1 \u2212 \u03b7)(p1\u22a5 + p2\u22a5 ) \u2212 \u03b7p3\u22a5 . One may express\nthe proton wave function in the center of mass frame in which the individual momenta are\ngiven by p1\u22a5 = k\u22a5 + \u03beK\u22a5 , p2\u22a5 = \u2212k\u22a5 + (1 \u2212 \u03be)K\u22a5 , p3\u22a5 = \u2212K\u22a5 . The structure of the\ncolor-spin-isospin wave function can be understood in a familiar form. This eigenstate of\nspin[14, 15] is a product of an anti-symmetric color wave function with a symmetric flavorspin-momentum wave function, given by \u03a8 = \u221a12 (\u03c6\u03c1 \u03c7\u03c1 + \u03c6\u03bb \u03c7\u03bb ) \u03a6, where \u03c6\u03c1 represents a\nmixed-antisymmetric and \u03c6\u03bb a mixed-symmetric flavor wave function and, \u03c7\u03c1,\u03bb represents\nmixed symmetric or anti-symmetric spin wave functions in terms of Dirac spinors. The\nlower components of these contain terms in which the spin of the quark is opposite to that\nof the proton, with the difference accommodated by the orbital angular momentum. Such\nterms are responsible for reproducing the experimental feature that QF2 /F1 is approximately\nconstant for Q2 \u2265 2 (GeV/c)2 [11, 12, 13].\nThe spin-independent momentum-space wave function is a function of the mass operator M0 of a non-interacting system of any P \u03bc : M02 = (K\u22a52 + m2 \u03b7)/\u03b7(1 \u2212 \u03b7) +\n2\n(k\u22a5\n+ m2 )/(\u03b7\u03be(1 \u2212 \u03be)),where m is the u, d quark mass. We take the S-state orbital function\n\u03a6(M0 ) to be of a power law form: \u03a6(M0 ) = N/(M02 + \u03b2 2 )\u03b3 that depends on \u03b2, \u03b3 and the\nconstituent quark mass m. Parameters of the Light Front Cloudy Bag Model[13], which\nmakes the Cloudy Bag Model[16] relativistic, are displayed in Table I. The effects of the\npion cloud are unimportant at high momentum transfer and are ignored here.\nUsing light front dynamics enables one to relate the proton wave functions in different\nreference frames with a kinematic boost. If the proton acquires a transverse momentum by\nthe absorption of a quantity of momentum, \u2206 \u2261 (0, \u2206\u22a5 ) = q \u2212 q\u2032 by a quark, the effects of\nthe boost are obtained by replacing the momenta k\u22a5 , K\u22a5 by k\u22a5 , K\u22a5 \u2212 \u03b7\u2206\u22a5 .\nThe evaluation of the Compton scattering amplitude MS \u2032 ,S (\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb) is made with an impulse\napproximation in which the Compton scattering occurs via the Born and crossed Born graphs\nof Fig. 1. The antisymmetric nature of \u03a8 allows us to take the scattering to occur on the third\nquark of charge Q3 . The incident (outgoing) photon has four momentum and polarization\nvector q, \u01eb (q, \u01eb\u2032 ), evaluated using the \u03b3p center of mass frame. MS \u2032 ,S (\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb) depends on the\n3\n\n\finitial spin S and final spin S \u2032 of the proton, as well as on \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 :\nMS \u2032,S (\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb) = 3Q23\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b7d2K\u22a5\n\nX\n\n\u03c1S \u2032 ,s\u2032 ;S,s(\u03b7, K\u2032 , k)\u016b(K \u2032 , s\u2032 )O\u01eb\u2032 ,\u01eb (K \u2032 , K)u(K, s),\n\n(2)\n\ns,s\u2032\n\nR\n\nwhere \u03c1(\u03b7, K\u2032 , k) \u2261 d\u03bed2k\u22a5 \u03a8\u2020S \u2032 ,s\u2032 (\u03be, k\u22a5 , \u03b7, K\u2032\u22a5 )\u03a8S,s (\u03be, k\u22a5 , \u03b7, K\u22a5 ), and in which the repeated indices(s, s\u2032 ) represent both spin and isospin (charge) quantum numbers of the struck\nthird quark. The quantities K, K \u2032 are four vectors given by K \u03bc = ((1 \u2212 \u03b7)M0 , \u2212K) and\n6 Ku(K, s) = mu(K, s), 6 K \u2032 u(K \u2032 , s) = mu(K \u2032 , s). Satisfying the latter two relations is necessary to maintain gauge invariance. The operator O\u01eb\u2032 ,\u01eb (K \u2032 , K) represents Compton scattering on a quark:\nO\u01eb\u2032 ,\u01eb (K \u2032 , K) = 6 \u01eb \u2032\n\n1\n\u2217 2 (K\n\n1\n+ q + K \u2032 + q\u2032) * \u03b3 + m\n(K \u2032 \u2212 q + K \u2212 q \u2032 ) * \u03b3 + m \u2032 \u2217\n2\n6\n\u01eb\n+\n6\n\u01eb\n6 \u01eb .

This is necessary to maintain the time reversal invariance of the\nresulting amplitudes. Deriving Eq. (2) from the full four-dimensional formalism involves\nintegration over the minus components of the wave function and neglecting modifications of\nthe intermediate propagator of the struck quark caused by spectator quarks. Note also that\nthe total momentum of the proton does not enter into the expression (2), so that our results\nare independent of frame.\nEach of s, s\u2032 , \u01eb, \u01eb\u2032 , has two possible values, so there are 16 amplitudes. Using parity\nconservation and time reversal invariance reduces the number of independent amplitudes to\nsix[17]. We calculate the 16 amplitudes and demonstrate explicitly that there really are only\nsix independent ones. It is not obvious that the impulse approximation used in obtaining\nEq. (2) will yield only six amplitudes. Applying parity invariance immediately reduces the\nnumber of independent amplitudes to eight. But the effects of time reversal invariance\nare more difficult to satisfy. This is because the sum of the quark minus-momenta is not\nequal to the minus-momentum of the proton. Thus conservation of four-momentum occurs\nonly at the hadronic level, but not in the \u03b3q scattering. However, numerical calculations\nshow that a reasonably accurate approximation can be made that leads to the respect of\ntime reversal invariance. Examine Eq. (2) and shift the variable of integration according to\nK\u22a5 \u2192 K\u22a5 +\u03b7\u2206/2. Then note that if the momentum transfer \u2206 is large compared to typical\nmomenta appearing in the wave function, one may ignore the component of K parallel to\n\u2206 in evaluating the matrix element \u016b(K \u2032 , s\u2032 )O(\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb)u(K, s). Numerical work shows that\nusing this approximation doesn't change the computed values of observables by significant\namounts, but does reduce the number of independent amplitudes to exactly six, and also\nmaintains gauge invariance.\nThe relevant experimental observables involve photons and protons of a definite helicity.\nThe \u03b3p-cm helicity amplitudes are determined by making a unitary transformation on the\nspin amplitudes MS \u2032,S (\u01eb\u2032 , \u01eb):\n\u03a6\u03bc\u2032 \u03bb\u2032 ,\u03bc\u03bb =\n\nX\n\nT \u2217 (p\u2032 )S \u2032 \u03bb\u2032 MS \u2032,S (\u01eb\u2032\u03bc , \u01eb\u03bc )TS,\u03bb (p),\n\n(4)\n\nS \u2032 ,S\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bb represent the helicity of the initial photon and initial proton, and TS,\u03bb (p) \u2261\n\u016b(p, s)uH (p, \u03bb)/(2Mp ) in which u represents an ordinary Dirac spinor and uH represents a\n4\n\n\fFIG. 2: Cross sections.

Our results, for the\nphoton energies of immediate experimental interest (3.2 and 4.3 GeV)[1, 2], are displayed\nin Fig. 4, and the related cross sections can be found in Fig. 5. Examining Fig. 4 shows\n5\n\n\fFIG. 3: Energy dependence of cross sections. The data are from Ref. [18]. The curves are obtained\nusing set 3 of Table I, with an increase in the value of m by 10%.\n\nthat the predicted values of KLL and ALL do not depend on the quark mass, and have little\nvariation with energy. The values of KLL are large and positive at large scattering angles.\nThis is similar to the KLL of Refs.[8, 10], But their predicted equality between KLL and ALL\ndoes not hold here\u2013 for backward scattering angles, we find KLL \u2248 \u2212ALL .\nThis demands explanation. In Refs. [8, 10] the equality between KLL and ALL arises from\nneglecting the variation of the quark's minus and tranverse momenta, and the effects of quark\norbital angular momentum that lead to vanishing proton helicity flip matrix elements. The\nmassless quarks are taken to move collinearly with the proton which consequently does not\nchange helicity. In our model, the role of orbital angular momentum and non-conservation\nof the proton helicity is the crucial aspect in reproducing the proton form factors[11].\nLet's consider scattering by 180\u25e6 (back-angle scattering) to illustrate how it is that\nKLL 6= ALL . Examine Eq. (4). The transformation matrices T (p)S\u03bb reduce to overb |\u03bbi = \u03bb|\u03bbi. Then for back-angle\nlaps between two-component spinors, in which \u03c3 * p\n1\n\u2217\n\u2032 \u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\nscattering T (p )S \u03bb = \u221a2 (\u03b4S \u2032 ,+1/2 + \u03bb \u03b4S \u2032 ,\u22121/2 ), T (p)S\u03bb = \u221a12 (\u03b4S,+1/2 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b4S,\u22121/2 ), so that\n\u03a62 = 21 [M++ + M\u2212\u2212 \u2212 M+\u2212 \u2212 M\u2212+ ] , \u03a66 = 21 [M++ + M\u2212\u2212 + M+\u2212 + M\u2212+ ] . The dependence of MS \u2032 S on the photon polarization vectors is suppressed, as these are the same\nfor \u03a62,6 . Equality of \u03a62 and \u03a66 can only occur if each of the proton spin flip matrix elements\nM+\u2212 , M\u2212+ vanish, or if their sum vanishes. Inspection of Eq. (3) shows that the spin-flip\nmatrix elements do not vanish, and that the terms \u03b3 * (q + q \u2032 ) = \u03b3 0 2q 0 lead to operators\n(1 + \u03c3x ) evaluated between Pauli spinors. The operator \u03c3x raises and lowers spins with\nexactly strength, so that M+\u2212 + M\u2212+ does not vanish, \u03a62 6= \u03a66 , and ALL 6= KLL .\nAnother way to understand this inequality is to examine the numerical effect of reducing\nthe quark mass towards 0. We find that this causes ALL to aproach KLL .\nThere are other polarization variables[10]. The helicity transfer from the incoming to the\noutgoing photon is given by DLL d\u03c3/dt = (d\u03c3(\u03bc = +, \u03bc\u2032 = +)/dt \u2212 d\u03c3(\u03bc = +, \u03bc\u2032 = \u2212)/dt) .\n\n6\n\n\fFIG. 4: KLL , ALL obtained using the parameter sets of Fig. 2. These are nearly independent of\nenergy and quark mass.\n\nFIG. 5: Computed values of\n\nd\u03c3\ndt\n\nthe parameter sets of Fig. 2 with an increased quark mass.\n\nRef. [10] finds that DLL \u2248 1. The polarization of the incoming proton is defined by P d\u03c3/dt =\n1\n[d\u03c3(\u2191)/dt \u2212 d\u03c3(\u2193)/dt] . In Ref. [10] small corrections lead to estimating that P \u2248 3%. Our\n2\nresult is that P = 0. Our prediction for DLL , shown in Fig 6, is that it has significant\ndeviations from unity at large scattering angles.\nNow consider sideways proton spin directions. The correlation between the helicity of the\n7\n\n\fFIG. 6: Computed values of DLL , using parameter sets of Table I.\n\nincoming photon and the sideways (S) polarization of the incoming proton, parallel or antiparallel to the S-direction is defined[10] as ALS , and the one for the sideways polarization of\nthe outgoing proton is KLS . We find KLS = 0 and ALS = 0, and that the incoming photon\nasymmetry \u03a3 [10] vanishes.\nLet's summarize. Poincar\u00e9 invariance, gauge invariance, conservation of parity and time\nreversal invariance are respected in our impulse approximation evaluation of the handbag\ndiagrams. Proton wave functions, previously constrained by comparison with measured\nform factors, that incorporate the influence of quark orbital angular momentum (and the\ncorresponding violation of proton helicity conservation) are used. Computed cross sections\nare in reasonably good agreement with early measurements. The value of KLL is large\nand positive for scattering at large angles. In contrast with earlier work, we find that\nKLL 6= ALL , and DLL 6= 1 at large scattering angles. With our model functions, photon\nlaboratory energies of 6 GeV or less are too low for the simplifying assumptions that lead\nto proton helicity conservation to be valid. Future experiments that measure ALL or DLL\ncan determine whether or not proton helicity conservation holds in Compton scattering at\nany given energy.\nAcknowledgments\n\nI thank B.
