Consequently, the supernovae data alone are insufficient to distinguish\nbetween a model with a cosmological constant and one in which G varies. However, the varying-G\nmodels prove not to be viable when other data are taken into account.

Cosmology is unique in that two apparently disjoint\ndisciplines-the physics of the very small and the physics of the very large-are both needed\nto achieve our current understanding of the universe. It is remarkable, for example, that\nquantum fluctuations that occurred on microscopic scales in the very early universe may\nhave left an imprint on the largest structures in the universe. The observation that the\nuniverse contains matter-with only trace amounts of antimatter, rather than matter and\nantimatter in equal amounts, may find its explanation, one day, using earthbound particle\naccelerators. Dark matter, for which there is much compelling evidence,3 may yet turn out\nto comprise weakly interacting particles that may be accessible in laboratories. The relatively recent synergy between the theories of the very small and the very large is a thrilling\nachievement. However, there is a cloud on the horizon called dark energy.4,5\nA big surprise in cosmology came in 1998 when the High-Z Team6 and the Supernova\nCosmology Project7 both observed, independently, that Type Ia supernovae were fainter\nthan expected. After careful consideration of alternative explanations, both teams of researchers interpreted their observations as evidence that the SNe Ia are further away than\nexpected, given their red shifts and assuming a decelerating universal expansion. If the SNe\nIa are further away than expected, then the average expansion rate of the universe since the\nbig bang must be higher than previously thought. Both teams, in fact, went further: they\nconcluded that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. Today, the broadly accepted\nhypothesis is that this acceleration is driven by a form of energy called dark energy that\npervades the universe. In the simplest model, dark energy is identified with the cosmological\nconstant \u039b that appears in the general form of Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity.\nIn more complicated models,5 dark energy is modeled as a dynamical, evolving, field.\nCosmologists have created a compelling and coherent cosmology based on the Friedmann\nequation\n\u0012 \u00132\n8\u03c0G\nKc2 \u039bc2\n\u0227\n=\n\u03c1\u2212 2 +\n,\na\n3\na\n3\nand the associated Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric1 ,\n\u0014\n\u0015\ndr2\n2\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+ r (d\u03b8 + sin \u03b8 d\u03c6 ) ,\nds = c dt \u2212 a (t)\n1 \u2212 Kr2\n2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n\fwhere a(t) is the dimensionless scale factor-normalized so that a(t0 ) = 1 at the present\ntime t = t0 , \u0227 \u2261 da/dt, G is the gravitational constant, \u03c1 is the density of all forms of\nenergy22 excluding the contribution from the cosmological constant, \u039b, and \u2212\u221e < K < \u221e\nis the spatial curvature. The radial coordinate r is defined so that the proper area of a\nsphere, centered at any conveniently chosen origin, is A0 = 4\u03c0r2 at the present time. As\nusual, symbols with a subscript of zero denote quantities evaluated at t = t0 . The comoving\ndistance \u03c7 associated with the radial coordinate r is given by\nZ r\ndr0\n\u221a\n,\n\u03c7 =\n1 \u2212 Kr02\n0\n= sin\u22121 (K 1/2 r)/K 1/2 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhile d(t) = a(t)\u03c7 is the proper distance at time t. By construction, the comoving and\nproper distances are numerically identical today. The radial coordinate r, comoving distance\n\u03c7, radius of curvature K \u22121/2 , and proper distance d(t) are conventionally measured in Megaparsecs (Mpc). Inverting Eq. (3), we obtain\nr = sin(K 1/2 \u03c7)/K 1/2 .\n\n(4)\n\nFor a spatially flat universe, that is, one with K = 0, Eq. (4) simplifies to r = \u03c7.\nThe standard model of cosmology, with K = 0 and \u039b > 0, works remarkably well;\nhowever, current physics predicts4 a value of the cosmological constant \u039b that exceeds the\nobserved value by a factor of at least 1050 ! This difficulty motivates the exploration of\nalternative explanations, such as ones that invoke time-varying \"constants\".8 After all, we\nknow of no compelling reasons why the parameters that appear in our current theories of\nthe physical universe should be independent of space and time. From some perspectives,\nthe puzzle is why they should be constant at all.9\nAnother motivation for exploring alternative explanations of the supernovae data is to determine whether they alone are sufficient to distinguish between a model with a cosmological\nconstant and models without, such as the varying-G models we consider in this paper.\nA third, rather different motivation, is the pedagogical value of such investigations. This\ntopic is ideally suited for directed individual study (DIS) by an undergraduate physics major. It is exciting and lends itself to open-ended exploration. The work reported below\nwas undertaken by one of the authors (RD), an undergraduate physics major, under the\nsupervision of the other (HBP). We share the view of many that, ideally, all undergraduates\n3\n\n\fshould be afforded the opportunity to engage in authentic research. However, this is not\nalways easy: many exciting topics unfortunately require rather more material than can be\nmastered in a reasonable amount of time by a busy student. The advantage of cosmology\nis that it is intrinsically interesting to many students and, provided one chooses the topic\ncarefully and one is prepared to make appropriate conceptual approximations, one can find\ninteresting cosmological studies that can be done using mathematics and concepts that are\nreadily accessible to an undergraduate student. We fully endorse the idea that, for such\nstudents, a \"mathematics first\" approach followed by applications is less desirable than the\n\"physics first\" approach as advocated by Hartle for general relativity.2 The cosmological\ninvestigation described below was done in that spirit.\nThis paper explores two simple phenomenological models of varying-G cosmology8 using\nthe data compiled by Kowalski et al.10 on 307 supernovae. We assume a spatially flat\n(K = 0) universe (motivated in part by the expectations from inflation1 ) and we set \u039b = 0.\nHowever, for completeness, we write all expressions in a form that is valid for arbitrary\nvalues of K and \u039b.\nWe find fits to the supernovae data that are competitive with the simplest dark energy\nmodel. The fact that non-dark energy models can account for these data is a reminder\nthat the supernovae data alone are insufficient to establish dark energy as the preferred\nhypothesis. That hypothesis becomes compelling only when different data-sets are analyzed\ntogether. Likewise, any varying-G model must fit not only the supernovae data, but must\nalso be in accord with other data. However, in view of our expressed goal to provide\nan example of an authentic research project that can be conducted in its entirety by an\nundergraduate student, we restrict the scope to only one other datum: the bounds on \u0120/G\nat our current epoch. We find that our two varying-G models fail the bounds on \u0120/G,\nthereby ruling out this form of variation in G. An interesting aspect of the first model is\nthat the scale factor becomes infinite in a finite amount of time. In such a model, all comes\nto an end in a catastrophic shredding of everything, a doomsday scenario that has been\ndubbed the big rip.11\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section II describes those additional aspects of FLRW\ncosmology that are needed to understand the SNe Ia data. Section III motivates the varyingG Friedmann equation we have used to describe the evolution of the scale factor, while\nSec. IV introduces our varying-G models and summarizes the results we obtained from\n4\n\n\fthem. The paper ends with a discussion and concluding remarks.\n\nII.\n\nSUPERNOVA COSMOLOGY\n\nA key problem in observational cosmology is measuring distances to galaxies. To do that\nwe need two things: 1) a standard candle and 2) an operational definition of distance. We\nconsider first the standard candle.\nA standard candle is a source whose absolute luminosity is known. Type Ia supernovae12\nare currently the best \"standardizable\" candles for very large distances. A Type Ia supernova\nis believed to occur when a star in a binary system overflows its Roche lobe (the region\nwithin which its matter is gravitationally bound) causing material from it to accrete onto\nthe companion white dwarf. The mass of the white dwarf gradually increases towards\nthe Chandrasekhar limit (of about 1.4 solar masses),13 triggering runaway nuclear burning\nwithin the star that releases more energy in a matter of weeks than the sun will emit in\nten billion years. In another class of models, an explosion is triggered by the merger of\ntwo low-mass white dwarfs. In a third class of models, a carbon-oxygen low-mass white\ndwarf explodes when the helium, accreted from a companion star, detonates. For a good\nreview of Type Ia supernovae models, see Ref.14 . By measuring specific characteristics of the\nsupernovae light curves (graphs of brightness as a function of time), it is possible to make\nempirically-derived corrections for the observed variations in SNe Ia brightness and thereby\ncreate well-calibrated standard candles.15\n\nA.\n\nLuminosity Distance\n\nThe proper distance between two points in space is a well-defined concept, but, unfortunately, it cannot be measured in practice. Instead, astronomers use a definition of distance\nbased on the flux of energy received on earth from the luminous object, that is, on the\nenergy received per unit area per unit time,\nf=\n\nL\n,\n4\u03c0r2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere L = dE/dt is the object's luminosity, that is, its rate of total energy emission, and\nA0 = 4\u03c0r2 is the proper area, at t = t0 , of the sphere centered at the location once occupied\n5\n\n\fby the supernova. This formula for the flux is valid for a static universe and for a source that\nemits energy isotropically. In an expanding universe, however, the luminosity L crossing this\nsphere is diminished by the factor (1 + z)2 . One factor of 1 + z arises from the reduction in\nenergy of each photon received on earth relative to the energy it had at emission, yielding\ndE \u2192 dE/(1 + z). By definition, the red shift z \u2261 (\u03bbr \u2212 \u03bbe )/\u03bbe where \u03bbe and \u03bbr are the\nemitted and received wavelengths, respectively. The second factor of 1 + z is due to the\nreduction in the rate of arrival of photons at the earth, which yields 1/dt \u2192 (1/dt)/(1 + z).\nThe corrected expression for the flux is then\nf=\n\nL\nL\n,\n\u2261\n2\n4\u03c0[(1 + z)r]\n4\u03c0d2L\n\n(6)\n\nwhere dL \u2261 (1 + z)r is called the luminosity distance. For arbitrary values of the curvature\nK, the radial coordinate r is related to the comoving distance \u03c7 via Eq. (4), which, as noted\nabove, reduces to r = \u03c7 when K = 0.\n\nB.\n\nDistance Modulus\n\nAstronomers measure energy fluxes. But, by convention, fluxes are converted into magnitudes m defined by f = q10\u22122m/5 = L/(4\u03c0d2L ), where q is the flux from objects of magnitude\nzero, with the luminosity distance dL measured in Mega-parsecs (Mpc), and absolute magnitudes M defined by fM = q10\u22122M/5 = L/(4\u03c0d2M ) where dM = 10\u22125 Mpc. Next they take\nthe logarithm to base 10 of the ratio fM /f = 100.4(m\u2212M ) = (dL /10\u22125 )2 to arrive at\nm \u2212 M = 5 log10 [dL /10\u22125 ],\n= 5 log10 [(1 + z)r(z)/10\u22125 ].\n\n(7)\n\nNote that in the ratio the constant q cancels. The difference \u03bc \u2261 m\u2212M between the apparent\nmagnitude m of a source and its absolute magnitude M is called the distance modulus. The\nanalysis of a supernova light curve results ultimately in two measured quantities: \u03bc and z.\nThe data10 used in our study are plotted in Fig. 123 . The cosmology is all contained in the\ndependence of the radial distance r, or, equivalently, the comoving distance \u03c7, on the red\nshift z. The red shift, in turn, is related to the dimensionless scale factor, a(t), as follows\na = 1/(1 + z).\n6\n\n(8)\n\n\fdistance modulus (\u03bc)\n\n46\n44\n42\n40\n38\n36\n34\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6\nred shift (z)\nFIG. 1: Measurements of (\u03bc, z) for 307 Type Ia supernovae, compiled by Kowalski et al.\n\nGiven a functional relationship between the comoving distance \u03c7 and red shift z, the\ndistance modulus function in Eq. (7) can be fitted to the data in Fig. 1 to extract the\nparameters of the cosmological model. A formula for the comoving distance \u03c7 can be\ndeduced from the FLRW metric, Eq. (2), by noting that light in vacuum travels on null\nworldlines (for which ds = 0). Therefore, a light ray from a supernova at red shift z satisfies\nthe relationship cdt = a(t)d\u03c7. Hence,\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u03c7(z) = c\n(1+z)\u22121\n\nda\n,\na\u0227\n\n(9)\n\nnoting that the light ray was emitted when the scale factor was a = 1/(1 + z) and received\nwhen it assumes the value unity, today.\n\n7\n\n\fIII.\n\nA VARYING-G FRIEDMANN EQUATION\n\nOur first assumption, which we have alluded to, is that the universe has zero spatial\ncurvature. Our second assumption is that the Friedmann equation, Eq. (1), for a K = \u039b = 0\nuniverse remains valid when G is allowed to vary with time. By valid we mean that the\nequation is a good approximation to some (unknown) exact equation describing the evolution\nof the scale factor in a universe in which G varies. This is an example of a conceptual\napproximation that renders the problem tractable for an undergraduate student. If we wish\nto remain strictly within the framework of general relativity, we should be cautious about\nreplacing Eq. (1) with one in which G is a function of time because the Friedmann equation\nis derived from Einstein's equations\nG\u03bc\u03bd + \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n8\u03c0G\nT\u03bc\u03bd ,\nc4\n\n(10)\n\nwhich do not permit variations8 in G. The tensors G\u03bc\u03bd and T\u03bc\u03bd are the components of the\nEinstein and energy-momentum tensors, respectively, and g is the metric tensor. In order\nto allow for a possible variation of G, theories more general than Einstein's are needed, such\nas the scalar-tensor theories8,16 in which gravity is assumed to couple to a scalar field \u03c6,\nwhich-for weak constant coupling-yields the relationship G \u221d \u03c6\u22121 . This, in turn, yields a\nmodified Friedmann equation with a time-dependent G and additional terms of order \u0120/G.\nIf the latter terms are small enough, we obtain a Friedmann equation identical in form to\nthe standard one, but with a time-dependent G.\nWriting G(t) = G0 f (a), where G0 is the current value of G and f (a) describes the\nassumed dependence of G on the scale factor a(t) and therefore cosmic time t, and using\nthe definitions\n\u03c1c0 \u2261 3H02 /8\u03c0G0 ,\n\u03c1\u039b \u2261 \u039bc2 /8\u03c0G0 ,\n\u03a9M (a) \u2261 \u03c1(a)/\u03c1c0 ,\n\u03a9\u039b \u2261 \u03c1\u039b /\u03c1c0 ,\n\u03a90 \u2261 \u03a9M (1) + \u03a9\u039b ,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c1c0 is the critical density now, \u03a9M (a) is the matter density parameter, and H0 is the\nHubble constant-that is, the value of the Hubble parameter H(t) \u2261 \u0227/a today, we may\n8\n\n\fwrite the modified Friedmann equation as\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0227\n= H02 f (a)\u03a9M (a) + (1 \u2212 \u03a90 )a\u22122 + \u03a9\u039b ,\na\n\n(12)\n\nnoting that\n\u2212 Kc2 = H02 (1 \u2212 \u03a90 ).\n\n(13)\n\nWith these definitions, we can write the expressions for the comoving distance \u03c7(z) and the\nuniversal time t(a) as follows,\nZ 1\nc\nda\np\n,\n\u03c7(z) =\n2\nH0 (1+z)\u22121 a f (a)\u03a9M (a) + (1 \u2212 \u03a90 )a\u22122 + \u03a9\u039b\nand\n1\nt(a) =\nH0\n\nZ\n0\n\na\n\ndx\np\n.\nx f (x)\u03a9M (x) + (1 \u2212 \u03a90 )x\u22122 + \u03a9\u039b\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nThe lifetime of the universe is given by t0 = t(1).\nOur third assumption is that the total mass-energy in the universe, whatever its nature,\nscales in the same way as matter; that is, we assume that \u03a9\u039b = 0 and \u03a9M (a) = \u03a9M 0 /a3 ,\nwhere \u03a9M 0 = \u03a9M (1) denotes the value of the matter density parameter today. Since we\nalso assume K = 0, Eqs. (11) and (13) show that, necessarily, \u03a90 = \u03a9M 0 = 1. However,\nobservations, interpreted within the context of the standard cosmology18 indicate that the\nmatter density parameter \u03a9M 0 \u2248 0.3. The difference between \u03a90 = 1 and \u03a9M 0 is presumed\nto be due to the cosmological constant or dark energy. If we wished to be consistent with\nthis value of \u03a9M 0 , while keeping \u039b = 0, we need to use a model with K < 0.\nOne of our goals, however, is to ascertain whether the SNe data, on their own, are\nsufficient to conclude that the \u039b > 0 model is preferred. To do so, we need merely exhibit\nanother model that works as well. Here we consider varying-G models with K = \u039b = 0 and\ntherefore \u03a9M 0 = 1. Alternatively, one could consider \u039b = 0, K 6= 0, models. It should be\nnoted, however, that the curvature term (1 \u2212 \u03a90 )a\u22122 cannot accelerate the expansion. In\na universe dominated by curvature, the Friedmann equation is \u0227 = constant, which implies\nzero acceleration. To obtain acceleration, one needs a term that dilutes less rapidly than the\ncurvature term, which is the case for a cosmological constant or for the varying-G models\ndescribed below.\n\n9\n\n\fIV.\n\nVARYING-G MODELS AND RESULTS\n\nIn principle, a model for the variation of G should arise from some deep theory.8 This,\nhowever, is far beyond the scope of this paper, which is to give an example of an interesting\ncosmological study than can be executed in its entirety by an undergraduate physics major,\nbut that nonetheless yields interesting results. We proceed in a purely phenomenological\nmanner. Our basic premise is that the supernovae are further away than expected because\ngravity was weaker in the past and, consequently, the universe decelerated less rapidly than\nwould be the case were G constant and equal to its current value, G0 .\n\nA.\n\nFits to Supernovae Data\n\nWe studied several forms for the function f (a) in G(a) = G0 f (a), but in this paper we\nreport results for only two of them, each with a single adjustable, dimensionless, parameter,\nb. The first varying-G model we studied is defined by\nf (a) = eb(a\u22121) , model 1.\nIn this model, there is no limit to how strong gravity can become. Another model studied\nis defined by\nf (a) = 2/(1 + e\u2212b(a\u22121) ), model 2,\nin which G is limited to twice its current value in the distant future. We have normalized\nboth models so that G(a) assumes its current value, G0 , when a = 1. For K = 0 models,\nthe distance modulus, Eq. (7), may be written as\n\u03bc(z, b, Q) = 5 log10 [(1 + z)H0 r(z)/c] + Q,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the offset Q determines the vertical location of the modulus curve24 . Note that\nH0 r(z)/c is dimensionless and independent of the Hubble constant.\nEvaluating Eqs. (14) and (15) for model 1, with K = 0 (that is, \u03a90 = 1) and \u03a9\u039b = 0, we\nfind\n\u03c7(z) = r(z) =\n\np\np\nc b/2 p\ne\n2\u03c0/b[erf( b/2) \u2212 erf( b(1 + z)\u22121 /2)],\nH0\n\n(17)\n\nand\nt(a) =\n\np\n\u221a\n1 b/2 p\n[e ( 2\u03c0/b erf( ab/2) \u2212 2 a e\u2212ab/2 )]/b.\nH0\n10\n\n(18)\n\n\fThis model exhibits a striking feature: the scale factor becomes infinite in a finite amount\nof time. We shall return to this point below. For model 2, the integrals in Eqs. (14) and\n(15) are evaluated numerically using the mid-point rule.25\nWe fit Eq. (16) to the SNe data in Fig. 1 by minimizing the function\n307\nX\n\u03c7 =\n[\u03bcn \u2212 \u03bc(zn , b, Q)]2 /\u03c3n2 ,\n2\n\n(19)\n\nn=1\n\nwith respect to the parameters b and Q, where 1 \u2264 n \u2264 307 labels the nth supernova at red\nshift zn and distance modulus \u03bcn , measured with an uncertainty of \u00b1\u03c3n . The minimization\nof Eq. (19) is done using the program TMinuit, which is part of the ROOT data analysis\npackage from CERN.19 For model 1, we get the result shown in Fig. 2. The fit gives the\n\n3\n2\n\nresidual\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nred shift (z)\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 2: Residuals, \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bc(zn ), of fit of model 1 to SNe Ia data (\u03c72 /N D = 313.0/305 = 1.03).\n\nvalue b = 2.09 \u00b1 0.08, from which we infer a lifetime of t0 = 15.1 \u00b1 0.3 (70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 /H0 )\n11\n\n\fGyr.26 The fact that the \u03c72 per degree of freedom (\u03c72 /N D) is 1.03 suggests that the modulus\nuncertainties are estimated correctly and that model 1 provides an excellent description of\nthe data.27 A similarly good fit is found for model 2, as shown in Fig. 3. This fit yields b =\n\n3\n2\n\nresidual\n\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\nred shift (z)\n\n1.5\n\nFIG. 3: Residuals, \u03bcn \u2212 \u03bc(zn ), of fit of model 2 to SNe Ia data (\u03c72 /N D = 316/305 = 1.04).\n\n3.27 \u00b1 0.11, with a \u03c72 /N D = 316/305 = 1.04. We find t0 = 16.2 \u00b1 0.4 (70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 /H0 )\nGyr. For the simplest dark energy model, for which f (a) = 1 and \u03a9M (a) = (1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b )/a3 with\n\u03a9\u039b > 0, we find \u03a9\u039b = 0.71 \u00b1 .02 and t0 = 14.0 \u00b1 0.3 (70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 /H0 ) Gyr, consistent\nwith the accepted results.4 The \u03c72 per degree of freedom of the fit is 310/305 = 1.02.\nSince there is no compelling statistical basis to reject any of these models, we conclude\nthat the supernovae data alone are insufficient to distinguish between them. However, these\ndata when analyzed along with others4 are consistent with a simple cosmology in which dark\nenergy mimics a cosmological constant with the value \u03a9\u039b \u2248 0.7. The varying-G models\nshould likewise be analyzed along with other data to see if a consistent picture emerges.\n12\n\n\fThe fact that a K = \u039b = 0 model requires \u03a9M 0 = 1, while the preferred value from galaxy\nand galaxy cluster measurements is \u03a9M 0 = 0.3, is already an indication of a difficulty. A\nsystematic analysis of the relevant data, however, is a large task beyond the scope of this\npaper. Instead, we illustrate the importance of including other data by comparing the\npredicted fractional variation of G, \u0120/G at the present epoch, with the available bounds.\n\nB.\n\nBounds on the Variation of G\n\nThe possible variation of G is usually characterized by the quantity \u0120/G, which in terms\nof the logarithmic derivative of the function f (a) is given by\n1 dG\nd ln f\n\u0120\n=\n\u0227 = H0\n,\nG\nG da\nda\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we have used the fact that H0 = \u0227/a = \u0227 at the present epoch. Figure 4 shows \u0120/G\nas a function of the scale factor, for models 1 and 2. We see that at a = 1, \u0120/G is equal\nto 1.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 y\u22121 and 1.15 \u00d7 10\u221210 y\u22121 , respectively. Unfortunately, these values for \u0120/G\nare one to three orders of magnitude larger than the upper bounds that range from about\n10\u221210 y\u22121 to 10\u221213 y\u22121 depending on the method used to extract the bound.20\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\nEngaging undergraduate students in research can be an effective way to keep them excited about science. Cosmology is particularly well suited in this regard because it is possible to find topics that are both manageable in scope and scientifically interesting. We\nhave presented an investigation of varying-G cosmological models that serve as examples of\ninteresting research problems that are well matched to the mathematical sophistication of\nan undergraduate.\nThe two phenomenological models we presented, in which the strength of gravity increases with cosmic time, provide excellent fits to the Type Ia supernovae data. We therefore\nconclude that the supernovae data alone cannot establish the dark energy hypothesis unambiguously. Other data are needed to render this hypothesis plausible. However, both our\nvarying-G models fail to satisfy the bounds on \u0120/G. Consequently, the particular variation\nof G described by these models is ruled out. In fact, one can make a stronger statement: all\n13\n\n\f1\n\n\u00d710-9\n\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\nG\nG\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nscale factor (a)\n\n2\n\nFIG. 4: Fractional change in G per year for model 1 (solid curve) and model 2 (dashed curve) as\na function of the dimensionless scale factor a(t).\n\nvarying-G models that give rise to accelerated expansion, and that are based on the FLRW\nmetric and the Friedmann equation, are ruled out by these bounds.21 Consider, for example,\nmatter-dominated models, for which the Friedmann equation is H 2 \u223c G/a3 \u2192 G \u223c a\u02272 .\n> H. But a value of \u0120/G\nThis yields \u0120/G \u223c H + 2\u00e4/\u0227, from which we conclude that \u0120/G \u223c\nof the order of H0 is inconsistent with the bounds on \u0120/G, which are less than H0 by one\nto three orders of magnitude.\nThe inability to distinguish between models (model degeneracy) is inherent in the Friedmann equation because the latter is sensitive only to the total energy density of the universe\nand is agnostic with respect to how the energy density arises. This may be seen by writing\n\n14\n\n\fthe Friedmann equation, Eq. (1), as\n\u0012 \u00132\n8\u03c0G\n\u0227\n=\n(\u03c1M + \u03c1K + \u03c1\u039b ),\na\n3\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03c1M , \u03c1K , and \u03c1\u039b are the density contributions from matter, the curvature and the\ncosmological constant, respectively. The Hubble parameter \u0227/a is related to the sum of\n\u03c1M + \u03c1K + \u03c1\u039b not the individual components; or, equivalently, to the sum\n\u03a9 \u2261 f (a)\u03a9M (a) + (1 \u2212 \u03a90 )a\u22122 + \u03a9\u039b .\nTherefore, it is possible to entertain different interpretations of the total energy density. For\nexample, any model based on the Friedmann equation can be reinterpreted as one in which\nmatter, perhaps of several different sorts, is either created, destroyed, or both, as the universe\nevolves. Consider, for example, the simple cosmological constant dark energy model, for\nwhich f (a) = 1, \u03a90 = 1 and the total energy density is given by \u03a9 = (1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b )/a3 + \u03a9\u039b .\nThis can be rewritten as \u03a9 = \u03a90M (a)/a3 with \u03a90M (a) = 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b + \u03a9\u039b a3 . Since a\u22123 is the\ndilution factor for matter, the function \u03a90M (a) describes an increasing matter density in\na comoving volume, which can be interpreted as the creation of matter as the universe\nexpands! Alternatively, as done here, one can maintain the mass continuity equation, in\nwhich case matter is neither created nor destroyed and \u03a9 = \u03a9M 0 /a3 , but allow G to vary\nlike f (a) \u223c 1 + a3 (1 \u2212 \u03a9M 0 )/\u03a9M 0 . Because of the invariance of the Friedmann equation\nwith respect to such changes in interpretation, it is necessary to impose constraints on the\ncosmological parameters to remove the model degeneracy. Such constraints can come from\nother data, or other equations, or both.\nIt seems odd, at first, that the strengthening of gravity with time leads not to the eventual\ngravitational collapse of the universe, but rather to its accelerating expansion. The reason\nfor this is that every form of energy contributes to the geometry of spacetime. A model in\nwhich the strength of gravity changes with time is equivalent to another model in which the\nenergy density changes in a specific way. If the energy density dilutes more rapidly than\na\u22122 , then the expansion will slow down. If the strength of gravity increases such that in the\nequivalent, constant-G model, the energy dilutes more slowly than a\u22122 , the expansion will\naccelerate. In our varying-G models, the effective energy density increases with time.\nFor model 1, the increasing strength of gravity leads to a startling prediction: a catastrophic end to such a universe. This conclusion follows from the limit a \u2192 \u221e of the lifetime\n15\n\n\fexpression, Eq. (18). We find that\nt(a \u2192 \u221e) =\n\np\n1\nexp(b/2) 2\u03c0/b/b.\nH0\n\n(22)\n\nAccording to this model, the universe has a finite lifetime of about 33 Gyr and will tear itself\nto pieces in its final moments! Such behavior has been dubbed the big rip and is a feature\nof cosmological models containing phantom energy.11 Within regions that are dominated by\nnon-gravitational forces, the effect of a cosmological constant does not change with time and\nconsequently the accelerating universal expansion will not disrupt already bound systems.\nBy contrast, as the universe ages the effect of phantom energy increases in any finite volume\nof space. Eventually, this precipitates an escalating cascade of destruction at ever smaller\nscales until everything is torn asunder. We can only hope that phantom energy is just that:\na phantom!\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Peter H\u00f6flich for an insightful discussion on the physics of Type Ia supernovae.\nThis work was supported in part by a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, S.

However, it is common to choose units so that c = 1, thereby erasing\nthe distinction between mass and energy. For pedagogical clarity however we keep the symbol\nc in all expressions. Note: [\u039b] =[K] = L\u22122 .\n\n23\n\nWe have described the bolometric magnitude, that is, the magnitude of a star assuming we are\n\n17\n\n\fable to be measure the flux across all wavelengths. In practice, however, fluxes are measured in\nwavelength bands defined by standard filters, such as the B-band filters.17 An observed supernova spectrum is red shifted with respect to the spectrum in the rest frame of the supernova.\nTherefore, in general, a filter will transmit a flux that differs from that which would have been\nmeasured were it possible to measure the flux in the supernova's rest frame. Astronomers use\ncorrections called K corrections to map the measured flux back to its value in the object's rest\nframe. Given a model of the object's spectrum, it is then possible, in principle, to infer the\nbolometric flux and hence the bolometric magnitude of the object. The distance moduli data\ncompiled by Kowalski et al. are derived from B-band magnitude data.\n24\n\nThe absolute luminosity of a supernova cannot be determined independently of the Hubble\nconstant H0 . Consequently, in the fit of the modulus function to the data, it is only the shape of\nthe function that contains useful information about the cosmology.
