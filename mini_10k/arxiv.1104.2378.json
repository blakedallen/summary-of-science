Strong observational evidences for dark energy are available from Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation and Sloan digital sky survey (SDSS) observations [3] that entities in modern\nphysics. Reviews on dark energy are available in [4]. Although observationally well-established, no single\ntheoretical model provides an eternally compelling framework within which cosmic acceleration or dark energy\ncan provide an entirely compelling framework within which the dark energy can be well-understood. Several\nmodels for dark energy have been proposed till date. Such models include quintessence, phantom, quintom,\nholographic dark energy etc. Discussions on these models are available in Copeland et al [4]. Determining\nthermodynamic parameters for the expanding (accelerated) universe and verification of the first and the second\nlaw for different cosmological horizons, investigating the relation between dynamics and thermodynamics of\nthe universe, studying the conditions required for validity of the generalized second law (GSL) have also been\nthe subjects of interest in recent years [5].\nSince the discovery of black hole thermodynamics in 1970s, physicists have been speculating that there should\nbe some relation between black hole thermodynamics and Einstein equations. In 1995, Jacobson [6] derived\nEinstein equations by applying the first law of thermodynamics \u03b4Q = T dS together with proportionality of\nentropy to the horizon area of the black hole. Here \u03b4Q and T are the energy flux and Unruh temperature\nseen by an accelerated observer just inside the horizon. Verlinde [7] found that the Friedmann equation in a\nradiation dominated Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe can be written in an analogous form of the\nCardy-Verlinde formula, an entropy formula for a conformal field theory. The first law of thermodynamics for\n1\nA\nthe cosmological horizon is given by \u2212dE = T dS, where T = 2\u03c0l\nis the Hawking temperature, and S = 4G\nis the\n2\nentropy with A = 4\u03c0l and G as the cosmological horizon area and Newton constant respectively (Cai and Kim\nin ref [8]). Einstein's field equations have been derived from the first law of thermodynamics in the references\ngiven in [8]. In [9], the gravitational field equations for the nonlinear theory of gravity were derived from\nthe first law of thermodynamics by adding some non equilibrium corrections. Profound physical connection\nbetween first law of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon and the Friedmann equation was established in [10].\nIn a spatially flat de Sitter spacetime, the event horizon and the apparent horizon of the Universe coincide and\nthere is only one cosmological horizon. When the apparent horizon and the event horizon of the Universe are\ndifferent, it was found that the first law and the second law of thermodynamics hold on the apparent horizon,\nwhile they break down if one considers the event horizon [11]. There are several studies in thermodynamics for\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\narundhatiwonderland@gmail.com\nsurajit\u2212 2008@yahoo.co.in, surajit.chattopadhyay@pcmt-india.net\nujjaldebnath@yahoo.com, ujjal@iucaa.ernet.in\n\n\f2\ndark energy filled universe on apparent and event horizons [12]. Setare and Shafei [13] showed that for the apparent horizon the first law is roughly respected for different epochs while the second law of thermodynamics is\nrespected. Considering the interacting holographic model of dark energy to investigate the validity of the GSL of\nthermodynamics in a non-flat (closed) universe enclosed by the event horizon, Setare [14] found that generalized\nsecond law is respected for the special range of the deceleration parameter. The transition from quintessence to\nphantom dominated universe was considered and the conditions of the validity of GSL in transition was studied\nin [15]. In the reference [16], a Chaplygin gas dominated was considered and the GSL was investigated taking\ninto account the existence of the observers event horizon in accelerated universes and it was concluded that\nfor the initial stage of Chaplygin gas dominated expansion, the GSL of gravitational thermodynamics is fulfilled.\nIn the present work, we study the validity of GSL of thermodynamics in the intermediate[18, 19] and logamediate [19] expansions of the universe bounded by the Hubble, apparent, particle and event horizons. According\nto the GSL, for our system, the sum of the entropy of matter enclosed by the horizon and the entropy of the\nhorizon must not be a decreasing function of time. We have investigated the GSL using as well as without using\nthe first law of thermodynamics. While considering the GSL we have taken into account the Hubble horizon,\napparent horizon, particle horizon and event horizon.\nII.\n\nGENERALIZED SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS\n\nWe consider the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe with line element\n\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t)\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\ndr2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n+\nr\n(d\u03b8\n+\nsin\n\u03b8d\u03c6\n)\n1 \u2212 kr2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a(t) is the scale factor and k is the curvature of the space and k = 0, 1 and \u22121 for flat, closed and open\nuniverses respectively.

We see that the rate of change of total entropy is increasing with time. In\nthis figure the time derivative stays at the positive level. This indicates that the GSL is valid on the particle\nhorizon.

Also, as with\npower-law inflation, intermediate inflation offers the possibility of density perturbation and gravitational wave\nspectra which differ significantly from the usual inflationary prediction of a nearly flat spectrum with negligible\ngravitational waves [18].

This indicates the validity of the GSL in the universes\nenveloped by Hubble, apparent and particle horizons. However, it fails to stay at positive level in the case of\nthe universe enveloped by the event horizon. This indicates the breaking down of the GSL without using the\nfirst law of thermodynamics in the intermediate scenario.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\nIn the present work, our endeavor was to investigate the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics in the logamediate and intermediate scenarios of the universe bounded by the Hubble, apparent,\nparticle and event horizons. We have investigated the generalized second law using two different approaches\nnamely, (i) using the first law of thermodynamics and (ii) without using the first law of thermodynamics.\nAs previously stated, the basic aim is to investigate whether dSX + dSIX i.e. the time derivative of the sum\nof the entropy of the universe bounded by the horizons and the normal entropy remains at non-negative level.\nTo do the same, we have considered the universe enveloped by Hubble, apparent, particle and event horizons.\nThe logamediate as well as intermediate scenarios have been investigated for the nature of the time derivative\nof the total entropy for four of the said horizons. With suitable choice of the model parameters, we have seen\nfrom figures 1 - 4 that if we use the first law to derive the time derivative of the total entropy, the generalized\nsecond law is valid for all of the four horizons irrespective of the curvature of the universe. Similar situation\nhappens (see figures 5 - 8) when we ignore the first law to get the time derivative of the total entropy. While\nconsidering the intermediate scenario we find from figures 9 - 12 that the generalized second law based on first\nlaw is always valid for all types of enveloping horizons and the curvature of the universe. However, if we ignore\nthe first law, we find that in intermediate scenario the generalized second law breaks down (see figure 16) for\nopen, flat and closed universe enveloped by the event horizon. The generalized second law without the first law\nin this scenario is valid if the enveloping horizons are Hubble, apparent and particle horizons (see figures 12 15). The validity of the generalized second law occurs irrespective of the use of the first law of thermodynamics\nin calculating the time derivative of the total entropy.\n\nReferences:\n[1] S. J.
