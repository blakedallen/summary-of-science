It is realized at (or close to)\nthe SUSY Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale MGUT \u2243\n2.86 \u00d7 1016 GeV and can be easily linked to extensions [3] of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model\n(MSSM) which provide solutions to a number of problems of MSSM. Namely, the \u03bc-problem of MSSM can be\nsolved via a direct coupling of the inflaton to Higgs superfields [4] or via a Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry [5] which\nalso solves the strong CP problem [6]. Also baryon number conservation can be an automatic consequence [4] of\na R symmetry and the baryon asymmetry of the universe\ncan be generated via leptogenesis which takes place [7]\nthrough the out-of-equilibrium decay of the inflaton's decay products.\nThe aforementioned resolution of the \u03bc-problem of\nMSSM via a PQ symmetry can be achieved [5] by considering non-renormalizable superpotential terms involving additional singlets which develop vacuum expectation\nvalues (VEVs) of the order of the PQ symmetry breaking scale. The emerging potential of these singlets has\na local minimum which is separated from the global PQ\nminimum by a sizable potential barrier preventing a successful transition from the trivial to the PQ vacuum. As\none can show [8], by considering the one-loop temperature corrections [9] to the scalar potential, this situation\npersists at all cosmic temperatures after reheating. It is,\nthus, obligatory to assume that, after the termination of\nFHI, the system emerges with the appropriate combina-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: lazaride@eng.auth.gr\naddress: kpallis@gen.auth.gr\n\ntion of initial conditions so that it is led [10] to the PQ\nvacuum. Stated differently, the PQ symmetry is to be\nbroken during or before FHI. As a consequence, tight upper bounds on the inflationary scale have to be imposed\nso that the isocurvature fluctuations [11] of the axion are\nconsistent with the observational bounds \u2013 this restriction, though, can be alleviated when cosmic strings are\nformed [12].\nThis latter complication can be avoided, if the PQ\nphase transition (PQPT) takes place after the end of\nFHI. This possibility can be realized adopting [13] only\nrenormalizable superpotential terms similar to those\nwhich lead to FHI. The \u03bc parameter of MSSM can also\nbe generated from the PQ scale as in Ref. [5]. On the\nother hand, this scheme may lead [14] to disastrous domain walls which, however, can be avoided [15, 16] by introducing extra matter superfields without jeopardizing\nthe unification of the MSSM gauge coupling constants.\nMoreover, the structure of the superpotential obliges us\nto consider extra couplings between the inflaton field of\nFHI and the inflaton-like field of PQPT in the K\u00e4lher\npotential. As a bonus, these couplings assist us to reconcile the results on the (scalar) spectral index ns of FHI\nand the recent seven-year results [17] from the Wilkinson\nmicrowave anisotropy probe (WMAP7) satellite.\nIndeed, it is well-known that the realization of FHI\nwithin minimal Supergravity (SUGRA) leads to ns which\nis just marginally consistent with the fitting of the\nWMAP7 data by the standard power-law cosmological\nmodel with cold dark matter and a cosmological constant\n(\u039bCDM). One possible resolution (for other proposals,\nsee Refs. [18\u201322]) of this problem is [23, 24] the addition\nto the K\u00e4hler potential of a non-minimal quatric term of\nthe inflaton field with a convenient choice of its sign. As\na consequence, a negative mass term for the inflaton is\ngenerated. In the largest part of the parameter space,\nthe inflationary potential acquires a local maximum and\n\n\f2\nminimum. Then, FHI of the hilltop type [25] can occur\nas the inflaton rolls from this maximum down to smaller\nvalues. Therefore, ns can become consistent with data,\nbut only at the cost of an extra indispensable mild tuning\n[23] of the initial conditions. Another possible complication is that the system gets trapped near the minimum\nof the inflationary potential and, consequently, no FHI\ntakes place.\nWithin our proposal, a negative mass term for the inflaton is generated too, which however depends on the\nvarious coefficients (of the order 0.01 \u2212 0.1) involved in\nthe K\u00e4hler potential and not exclusively on the quatric\nterm of the inflaton field. As a consequence, sufficiently\nlow ns can be achieved with either sign of the terms in the\nK\u00e4hler potential and the inflationary potential remains\nmonotonic during the period of FHI. Therefore, complications due to the appearance of maxima and minima\nalong the inflationary path can be eluded. Another byproduct of our proposal is that the reheat temperature\nafter PQPT, calculated consistently with the model interactions, turns out to be low enough so that the grave constraint [26, 27] and the potential problem of\nitino (G)\ntopological defects [28] of FHI can be significantly relaxed\nsince an entropy release takes place after PQPT. On the\nother hand, the reheat temperature is high enough so\nthat non-perturbative electroweak sphalerons are operative and, consequently, thermal [29] or non-thermal [30]\nleptogenesis can, in principle, work.\nBelow, we present the basic ingredients of our model\n(Sec. II) and describe the inflationary potential and dynamics (Secs. III and IV). We then exhibit the constraints imposed on our cosmological set-up (Sec. V). We\nend up with our numerical results (Sec. VI) and our conclusions (Sec. VII).\nII.\n\nMODEL DESCRIPTION\nA.\n\nThe general set-up\n\nIn order to explore our scenario, we adopt the\nleft-right symmetric gauge group GLR = SU(3)c \u00d7\nSU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R \u00d7 U(1)B\u2212L . In our scheme, GLR can\nbe broken down to the standard model gauge group GSM\nat a scale close to the SUSY GUT scale MGUT through\nthe VEVs acquired by a conjugate pair of SU(2)R doublet left-handed Higgs superfields, \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6, with B\u2212L =\n\u22121, 1 respectively. As a consequence, no cosmic strings\nare produced [28, 31] in this realization of standard FHI\nand, therefore, we are not obliged to impose extra restrictions on the parameters \u2013 as e.g. in Ref. [32].\nThe model possesses also three global U(1) symmetries. Namely, a (color) anomalous PQ symmetry\nU(1)PQ , an anomalous R symmetry U(1)R , and the\nbaryon number symmetry U(1)B . Note that global continuous symmetries can effectively arise [33] from the rich\ndiscrete symmetry groups encountered in many compactified string theories (see e.g. Ref. [34]).

For simplicity, we restrict our\nanalysis to real \u03bb's.

In this basis, the most general K\u00e4hler potential of our model includes interference\nterms of S and P even at the quadratic level \u2013 contrary\nto the choice opted in Ref. [37].

The ellipsis represents higher order terms involving the waterfall fields (\u03a6, \u03a6\u0304, Q, and Q\u0304)\nand S and P . We can neglect these terms since they have\nnegligible impact on the SUSY vacuum and are irrelevant\nalong the inflationary path \u2013 see below.\nThe usual superpotential terms of MSSM can be derived from the following superpotential:\nWm = \u03bb\u03bc\n\n\u03a6\u0304lic \u03a6\u0304ljc\nQ\u03042 h2\n+ y\u03bdij\n+ ylij li hljc + yqij qi hqjc (3)\n2mP\nmP\n\nwith mP \u2243 2.44 \u00d7 1018 GeV being the reduced Planck\nscale. Here, the ith generation SU(2)L doublet lefthanded quark and lepton superfields are denoted by qi\nand li respectively, whereas the SU(2)R doublet antiquark and antilepton superfields by qic and lic respectively. The electroweak Higgs superfields are contained\nin a SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R bidoublet Higgs superfield h. The\nfirst term in the right-hand side (RHS) of Eq. (3) generates the \u03bc term of MSSM via the PQ breaking scale\n(see below), while the second term generates intermediate scale masses for the right-handed neutrinos and, thus,\nseesaw masses [2] for the light neutrinos.\nThe representations under GLR and the charges under\nthe global symmetries of the various matter and Higgs\nsuperfields contained in this model are presented in Table I, which also contains the extra matter superfields\nrequired for evading the domain wall problem associated\nwith the PQPT together with a new imposed global symmetry U(1)D \u2013 see Sec.

In the limit where mP tends to infinity, we can obtain the SUSY limit, VF , of VSUGRA in\nEq.

(2) have an impact on Eq. (5), the corresponding\nterms in the last line of this equation do not contribute\nsince they are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic in the\nfield variables. Also the terms in the ellipsis in Eq. (2)\nhave no appreciable contribution to the RHS of Eq. (5)\nsince they are suppressed by powers of mP .\nThe D\u2013term contribution vanishes along the direction\n|\u03a6\u0304| = |\u03a6|.\n\n(6)\n\nFrom the potential in Eq. (5) and taking into account\nthat M \u226b fa , we find that the SUSY vacuum lies at\nhSi = 0, |h\u03a6\u0304i| = |h\u03a6i| \u2243 M, hP i = 0, and |h\u03c6Q i| = fa ,\n(7)\nwhere we have introduced the canonically normalized\nscalar field \u03c6Q = 2Q = 2Q\u0304. Note that, since the sum\nof the arguments of hQ\u0304i, hQi must be 0, Q\u0304 and Q can\nbe brought to the real axis by an appropriate PQ transformation. As a consequence of Eqs. (7), W leads to a\nspontaneous breaking of GLR and UPQ (1). The same superpotential W gives also rise to a stage of FHI and a\nPQPT, which is highlighted in the following.\nThe potential in Eq. (5) possesses a D\u2013 and F\u2013flat\ndirection at\n\u03a6\u0304 = \u03a6 = 0 and Q\u0304 = Q = 0\n\n(8)\n\nwith a constant potential energy density\nVHI0 \u2243\n\n\u03ba2 M 4\n(since M \u226b fa ).\n1 \u2212 a2\n\n(9)\n\nThe direction in Eq.

However, we can verify that a D- and\nF-flat direction appears at\nS = 0, \u03a6\u0304 = \u03a6 = M, and Q\u0304 = Q = 0\n\n(11)\n\nwith potential energy density\nVPQ0 = \u03ba2a fa4 /16.\n\n(12)\n\nSince VPQ0 \u226a VHI0 , VPQ0 can temporally dominate over\nradiation after the end of FHI and, if |P | \u2265 fa , drive a\nPQPT \u2013 see Sec.

At the end of PQPT, the\nfields P , Q\u0304, and Q acquire their VEVs in Eq. (7). The\n\u03bc term of the MSSM is generated via the first term in\n2\nthe RHS of Eq. (3) with |\u03bc| \u223c \u03bb\u03bc hQ\u0304i /mP , which is of\nthe right magnitude if hQ\u0304i = fa /2 \u2243 5 \u00d7 1011 GeV and\n\u03bb\u03bc \u223c (0.001 \u2212 0.01).\nThe cosmological scenario above can be attained if we\nensure that, at the end of FHI, the fields \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6 acquire\ntheir VEVs in Eq. (7), while the fields Q\u0304 and Q remain\nequal to zero. To quantify this crucial requirement, we\nconstruct the mass spectrum of the theory along the inflationary path of Eqs. (8) and (10). We summarize our\nresults in Table II. We see that the mass matrices of\nthe scalar components of the \u03a6\u0304, \u03a6 and Q\u0304, Q superfields\ndevelop a negative eigenvalue as |S| and |\u03c3a | cross below\ntheir critical values \u2013 i.e. their lower bounds in Eq. (10).\nHowever, if the tachyonic instability of the \u03a6\u0304 \u2212 \u03a6 system\noccurs first, \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6 start evolving towards their VEVs,\nwhereas Q\u0304 and Q continue to be confined to zero.\n\nC.\n\nEvading the domain-wall problem\n\nIt should be mentioned that instanton and soft SUSY\nbreaking effects explicitly break U(1)R \u00d7 U(1)PQ to a discrete subgroup. Spontaneous breaking of this subgroup\nat the PQPT by hQ\u0304i and hQi can lead [14] to a disastrous\ndomain wall production since this transition occurs after\nFHI. In order to avoid this problem, we must introduce\nsome extra matter fields (see Table I) following Ref. [15]\n(see also Ref. [16], where the set-up is similar to ours).\nNamely, we introduce n pairs of left-handed superfields\nD\u0304a and Da (a = 1, ..., n) which are SU(3)c antitriplets\nand triplets respectively with R charge equal to 2 and\nPQ charge equal to 1. However, these fields acquire intermediate scale masses after the PQ breaking, which\ncould prevent the unification of the MSSM gauge coupling constants. To restore gauge unification, we include\nan equal number of SU(2)L \u00d7 SU(2)R bidoublet superfields Ha with PQ and R charges equal to those of D\u0304a\nand Da . In accordance with all the imposed symmetries,\nwe can give intermediate scale masses to D\u0304a \u2212 Da and\n\nHa through the superpotential terms\nWdw = \u03bbDa Q\u0304D\u0304a Da + \u03bbHa Q\u0304Ha2 .\n\n(13)\n\nHere, we chose a basis in the D\u0304a \u2212Da and Ha space where\nthe coupling constant matrices \u03bbDa and \u03bbHa are diagonal.\nNote that the full superpotential is invariant under a new\nglobal U(1)D symmetry \u2013 see Table I. During FHI, we\ntake D\u0304a = Da = Ha = 0 and, at the SUSY vacuum, we\nhave hD\u0304a i = hDa i = hHa i = 0.\nThe number n can be determined as follows: The explicitly unbroken subgroup of U(1)R \u00d7 U(1)PQ can be\nfound, for every n, from the solutions of the system\n4\u03b1 = 0 (mod 2\u03c0) and \u2212 12\u03b1 + 2(n \u2212 6)\u03b2 = 0 (mod 2\u03c0) ,\n(14)\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the phases of a U(1)R and U(1)PQ\nrotation respectively. Here we took into account that the\nR charge of W and, thus, of all the soft SUSY breaking\nterm is 4 and that the sum of the R [PQ] charges of the\nSU(3)c triplets and antitriplets is \u221212 [2(n \u2212 6)]. We can\ninduce, therefore, that the explicitly unbroken subgroup\nis Z4 \u00d7 Z2(n\u22126) . It is then important to ensure that this\nsubgroup is not spontaneously broken by hQ\u0304i and hQi,\ni.e.,\n2\u03b2 = 0 (mod 2\u03c0) ,\n\n(15)\n\nsince otherwise cosmologically disastrous domain walls\nwill be produced at PQPT. This requirement implies that\nn must be 5 or 7. In both these cases, the subgroup of\nU(1)R \u00d7 U(1)PQ left unbroken by instantons and SUSY\nbreaking coincides with the one left unbroken by hQ\u0304i and\nhQi and is a Z4 \u00d7 Z2 .\nIt is easy to find the contribution of D\u0304a , Da , and Ha to\nthe coefficients b1 , b2 , and b3 controlling [38] the one loop\nevolution of the three gauge coupling constants g1 , g2 ,\nand g3 within MSSM. It is then straightforward to prove\nthat, if we assign B \u2212 L = 2/3 and \u22122/3 to D\u0304a and Da\nrespectively, the quantities b2 \u2212 b1 and b3 \u2212 b2 (which are\n[38] crucial for the unification of g1 , g2 , and g3 ) remain\nunaltered. Therefore, the inclusion of the extra matter\nsuperfields does not disturb the gauge unification at one\nloop.\nRecapitulating this section, let us present the total superpotential of our model which is\nWtot = W + Wm + Wdw ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere W , Wm and Wdw are given in Eq. (1), (3), and\n(13) respectively.\nIII.\nA.\n\nTHE INFLATIONARY EPOCH\n\nStructure of the inflationary potential\n\nThe potential which can drive the inflationary stage of\nour set-up has the following general form\nVHI = VHI0 + VHIs + VHIc ,\n\n(17)\n\n\f5\nwhere VHIs and VHIc represent, respectively, SUGRA and\none-loop radiative corrections to the inflationary potential, calculated in Sec. III A 1 and III A 2. Let us note,\nin passing, that the most important contribution [39] to\nVHI from the soft SUSY breaking terms is expected to\nstart playing an important role for rather small \u03ba's and\nso, it remains negligibly small in our set-up due to the\n\nVHIs \u2243\n\nwhere\n\nlarge \u03ba's used \u2013 see Sec.

Therefore, we are obliged to invoke non-zero coefficients of the\nhigher order terms of the K\u00e4hler potential considered in\n\nRadiative corrections\n\nThe constant tree-level potential energy density VHI0\ncauses SUSY breaking leading [2] to the generation of\none-loop radiative corrections, which provide a logarithmic slope along the inflationary path necessary for driving the system towards the vacua. Inserting the spectrum\nshown in Table II in the well-known Coleman-Weinberg\nformula [42], we find (compare with Ref. [36]) that the\none-loop radiative correction to VHI is\nVHIc = V\u03ba + V\u03bb ,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere\nV\u03ba =\n\n\u03ba2 VHI0\n16\u03c0 2 (1 \u2212 a2 )\n\n\u0012\n2 ln\n\n\u0013\n\u03ba2 xM 2\n+\nf\n(x)\nrc\n(1 \u2212 a2 )\u039b2\n\n(43)\n\nwith x = (1 \u2212 a2 )|S|2 /M 2 and\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03ba(\u03bb \u2212 a\u03baa )xa M 2\n(\u03bb \u2212 a\u03baa )2 VHI0\n2\nln\n+\nf\n(x\n)\nV\u03bb =\nrc\na\n32\u03c0 2 (1 \u2212 a2 )\n(1 \u2212 a2 )\u039b2\n(44)\nwith xa = (1 \u2212 a2 )|\u03c3a |2 /\u03ba(\u03bb \u2212 a\u03baa )M 2 . In the relations\nabove, we have taken into account that the dimensionality of the representations to which \u03a6\u0304 and \u03a6 [Q\u0304 and Q]\nbelong is 2 [1] \u2013 see Table I \u2013 and we have defined\nfrc (y) = (y+1)2 ln (1 + 1/y)+(y\u22121)2 ln (1 \u2212 1/y) . (45)\nLet us note that, for x \u226b 1 and xa \u226b 1, V\u03ba [V\u03bb ] can be\nwell approximated by replacing frc (y) \u2243 3 in the RHS of\nEq. (43) [Eq. (44)] \u2013 see Sec. III B. Although rather large\n\u03ba's, \u03baa 's, and \u03bb's are used in our work, renormalization\ngroup effects [43] remain negligible and so our results are\nindependent from the renormalization scale \u039b.\nSubstituting Eqs. (39) and (40) into Eq. (27) and then\ninto Eqs. (43) and (44), we can derive VHIc as a function\nof \u03c3, s, and q.\nB.\n\nThe inflationary dynamics\n\nThe evolution of the various fields involved in our\nscheme during FHI is governed by their equations of motion (e.o.m.)\nf \u0308 + 3H f \u0307 + VHI,f = 0 with f = \u03c3, s, and q.\n\n(46)\n\nwhere the dot denotes derivation w.r.t. the cosmic time\nt and H is the Hubble parameter. The solution of the\n\n\f7\nsystem in Eq.

Here the prime\ndenotes derivation w.r.t. N . Converting the time derivatives to derivatives w.r.t. N , Eq. (46) becomes\nH 2 f \u2032\u2032 + (3H + H \u2032 )Hf \u2032 + VHI,f = 0\n\n(48)\n\nwith f = \u03c3, s, or q. This system can be solved numerically for the period of FHI by taking\ns\n2VHI0\nH = HHI =\n,\n(49)\n2\n6mP \u2212 \u03c3 \u20322 \u2212 s\u20322 \u2212 q \u20322\nV = VHI given by Eq.

We checked that our results are pretty stable\nagainst variation of fHIi \u2013 see also Sec. VI.\nNevertheless, we can obtain a comprehensive and\nrather accurate approximation \u221a\nto the \u221a\ninflationary dynamics if we put H \u2243 HHI0 = VHI0 / 3mP (H \u2032 = 0)\nand keep in Eq. (48) the most important terms in the\nexpansion of VHI,f . In particular, we can easily verify\nthat VHI,q turns out to be proportional to q. As a consequence, Eq. (48) for f = q is a second order linear homogeneous differential equation which admits an oscillatory\nsolution with decreasing amplitude. Therefore, q rapidly\ndecreases to zero and so it does not influence the dynamics of the other fields. On the contrary, the e.o.m. of\ns is non-homogenous as we can realize by inserting into\nEq.

(60)\n\nThe end of FHI takes place at \u03c3 = \u03c3f , when the conditions of Eq. (10) or Eq. (55) are violated. For \u03ba <\n\u223c 0.005,\none can consider the former case only since the slow-roll\nconditions are violated infinitesimally close to the relevant critical point of the inflationary trajectory.\nSoon afterwards, the inflaton system consisting\n\u221a of the\ntwo complex scalar fields S and (\u03b4 \u03a6\u0304 + \u03b4\u03a6)/ 2 \u221a\n(where\n\u03b4 \u03a6\u0304 = \u03a6\u0304\u2212M and \u03b4\u03a6 = \u03a6\u2212M ) with mass m1inf = 2\u03baM\nsettles into a phase of damped oscillations about the\nSUSY vacuum and decays to MSSM degrees of freedom\n\n\f8\nreheating the universe.\n\u221a The predominant decay channels\nof S and (\u03b4 \u03a6\u0304+\u03b4\u03a6)/ 2 are to fermionic and bosonic Q\u0304, Q\nrespectively via tree-level couplings derived from the last\nterm in the RHS of Eq.

Taking also into account that, during the\n\u22121/3\nMD epoch, R \u221d \u03c1osc (where \u03c1osc is the energy density\nof the oscillating system), we can derive the value of s at\nthe beginning of PQPT:\nsPQi \u2243\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c11rh\nVHI0\n\n\u00131/4\n\nsHIf with \u03c11rh =\n\n\u03c02\n4\ng1rh\u2217 T1rh\n30\n\n(64)\n\nbeing the radiation energy density at temperature T1rh\nand sHIf the value of s at the end of FHI, which can\nbe approximated by inserting \u03c3 = \u03c3f into Eq. (54). Note\nthat during the subsequent RD era, s remains frozen (see\nRef. [41] and footnote 1 in Ref. [49]) and so the further\nreduction of s relative to \u03c3 can be evaded \u2013 cf. Ref. [44].\n\nIV.\n\nTHE STAGE OF PQPT\n\n1/4\nFor T <\n\u223c VHI0 , the cosmological dynamics is governed\nby the second term of W in the RHS of Eq. (1). The\nSUGRA corrections can be safely ignored since |P | \u223c\nfa \u226a mP . The relevant F-term scalar potential is\n\nVPQF = \u03ba2a Q\u0304Q \u2212 fa2 /4\n\n2\n\n+ \u03ba2a |P |\n\n2\n\nwhere\nAP =\n\nwhere g1rh\u2217 = g\u2217 (T1rh ) counts the effective number of\nrelativistic degrees of freedom at temperature T1rh . We\nfind g1rh\u2217 \u2243 438.75 [g1rh\u2217 \u2243 513.75] for the MSSM spectrum plus right handed neutrinos and the particle content of the superfields P , Q\u0304, Q, D\u0304a , Da , and Ha for n = 5\n[n = 7].\nFor relatively large \u03bb's (\u2243 0.05 \u2212 0.1), we get T1rh >\n1/4\nVPQ0 . As a consequence, after the end of FHI, we obtain matter domination (MD) for T \u2265 T1rh and radia1/4\n<\ntion domination (RD) for VPQ0 <\n\u223c T \u223c T1rh . During MD\nthe evolution of s can be found by solving its e.o.m. for\nN > NHI , i.e., inserting [45, 46, 48]\nH = HHI0 e\u22123(N \u2212NHI )/2 , V =\n\npotential \u2013 cf. Sec. III A 2. Indeed, the particle spectrum there includes a Dirac spinor with mass \u03baa |P | and\u0001\n2 complex scalars with mass squared \u03ba2a |P |2 \u00b1 fa2 /4\nand, therefore, VPQc can be written [42] as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03ba2a A2P s2\n\u03ba2a VPQ0\n2 ln\n+ frc (xs ) ,\n(66)\nVPQc =\n32\u03c0 2\n\u039b2\n\n\u0001\n|Q\u0304|2 + |Q|2 . (65)\n\nAlong the F\u2013flat direction in Eq. (11), VPQF takes the\nconstant value in Eq. (12), which breaks SUSY creating\na mass splitting in the supermultiples Q and Q\u0304 and giving\nrise to one-loop radiative correction, VPQc , to the relevant\n\nA\u2212 N\u2212 + A+ N+\nA+ A\u2212 (U\u2212 \u2212 U+ )\n\n(67)\n\nwith xs = AP s/fa and P = AP s/2 \u2013 see Eqs. (27), (39),\nand (40). When |P | < fa /2, one mass squared becomes\nnegative and suggests a phase transition along the |P |axis. Assuming gravity mediated soft SUSY breaking,\nthe potential there has the form\np\n1\nVPQ = VPQ0 + m2s s2 \u2212 2VPQ0 |as |s + VPQc (68)\n2\n\nfor s \u2265 fa /AP . Here, ms is the soft SUSY breaking mass\nof s and as is the soft SUSY breaking tadpole [39]. In\nEq. (68), we take the phase of as to be arg(as ) = \u03c0 which\nminimizes the VPQ for given s > 0. For reasonable values of the parameters involved, VPQ does not give rise to\ninflation, mainly due to the contribution of VPQc which\nspoils the \u03b7-criterion \u2013 and has not been taken into account in the analysis of Ref. [1]. This negative result\nremains even if we consider dissipative effects [50] due to\nthe presence of the extra superpotential terms in Eq. (13).\nTherefore, we are obliged to assume that after a negligible number of e-folds, the system consisting\nof the two\n\u221a\ncomplex scalar fields P and (\u03b4 Q\u0304 + \u03b4Q)/ 2 (where \u03b4 Q\u0304\u221a=\nQ\u0304\u2212fa /2 and \u03b4Q = Q\u2212fa /2) with mass mPQ = \u03baa fa / 2\nenters into an oscillatory phase about the PQ minimum\nand eventually decays, via the first non-renormalizable\ncoupling in the RHS of Eq. (3), to Higgses and Higgsinos\nrespectively with a common decay width [3]\n\u00132\n\u0012\nfa\n1 2\n\u03bb\u03bc\nmPQ .\n(69)\n\u03932 =\n2\u03c0\n2mP\nThe corresponding reheat temperature is [47] calculated\nby\n\u00131/4 p\n\u0012\n72\nT2rh =\n\u03932 mP ,\n(70)\n5\u03c0 2 g2rh\u2217\n\nwhere g2rh\u2217 = 228.75 is the energy density effective number of degrees of freedom for the MSSM spectrum.\nV.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS\n\nUnder the assumptions that (i) the curvature perturbation generated by \u03c3 is solely responsible for the observed\ncurvature perturbation and (ii) the violation of Eq. (10)\noccurs along the lines of Sec. II B, the parameters of our\nmodel can be restricted imposing the following requirements:\n\n\f9\na.\nAccording to the inflationary paradigm, the\nhorizon and flatness problems of the standard Big\nBang (SBB) can be successfully resolved provided that\nthe number of e-foldings, NHI\u2217 , that the scale k\u2217 =\n0.002/Mpc suffers during FHI takes a certain value which\ndepends on the details of the cosmological scenario. Employing standard methods [20], we can easily derive the\nrequired NHI\u2217 at k\u2217 :\n1/4\n\n1/4\nVPQ0\n2\nV\n1\n1 T1rh T2rh\nNHI\u2217 \u2243 23 + ln HI0 \u2212 ln\n+ ln\n3 1 GeV 3 1 GeV 3\n1 GeV2\n(71)\n1/4\nconsistently with the fact that T1rh > VPQ0 and, thus, we\nobtain MD followed by RD during the era between the\nend of FHI and the onset of PQPT. On the other hand,\nNHI\u2217 can be found from\n\nNHI\u2217 = NHI \u2212 N\u2217 ,\n\n(72)\n\nwhere NHI is the total number of e-foldings generated\nduring FHI and N\u2217 is the number of e-foldings elapsed\nfrom the onset of FHI until the scale k\u2217 crosses outside\nthe horizon of FHI and corresponds to the field value \u03c3\u2217 .\nb.\nThe power spectrum PR of the curvature perturbation, which is generated during FHI and can be calculated at the pivot scale k\u2217 as a function of \u03c3\u2217 , is to be\nconfronted with the WMAP7 data [17], i.e.\n3/2\n\nVHI\n1\n1/2\nPR = \u221a\n3\n2 3 \u03c0mP |VHI,\u03c3 |\nc.\n\n\u03c3=\u03c3\u2217\n\n\u2243 4.93 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n(73)\n\n(74)\n\nis to be consisted with the fitting of the WMAP7 data\nby the standard power-low \u039bCDM:\n<\nns = 0.963 \u00b1 0.028 \u21d2 0.935 <\n\u223c ns \u223c 0.991\n\n(75)\n\nat 95% confidence level (c.l.). Note, in passing, that the\nrunning of ns and the scalar-to-tensor ratio turn out to\nbe vanishingly small in our model as in any model of FHI.\nd.\nIn order for the PQPT to take place after a short\ntemporary domination of VPQ0 , the value of |P | at the\nonset of PQPT, |PPQi |, must be adequately larger than\nits critical value along the F-flat direction in Eq. (11).\nThis entails\n|PPQi | > fa /2 \u21d2 sPQi > fa /AP ,\n\nwhich is suppressed relative to Y1G\ne . In order to avoid\nspoiling the success of the SBB nucleosynthesis, an upper\ne\nbound on YG\ne is to be imposed depending on the G mass,\ne\nmG\ne, and the dominant G decay mode. For the conservae decays with a tiny hadronic branching\ntive case that G\nratio, we have\n( \u221214\n(\n10\n0.69 TeV\n\u221213\n<\nYG\n\u2243\nfor\nm\n10\n10.6 TeV\n(79)\ne\u223c\ne\nG\n10\u221212\n13.5 TeV\nrespectively. The bound above can be somehow relaxed\ne However, it is achievable in our\nin the case of a stable G.\nmodel, as we see below.\nVI.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nAs can be easily seen from the relevant expressions\nabove, our cosmological set-up depends on the following\nparameters:\n\u03ba, \u03baa , \u03bb, M, fa , \u03bb\u03bc , n, a, b, c, d, e, f, and g.\n\nThe (scalar) spectral index ns , which is given by\nns = 1 \u2212 6\u01eb(\u03c3\u2217 ) + 2\u03b7(\u03c3\u2217 ),\n\nHowever, in the opposite case, if we take into account\nthe entropy produced after PQPT during the subsequent\nreheating process \u2013 for computational details see Appendix A \u2013 we obtain\n\u00131/4\n\u0012 2\nT2rh\n\u03c0\nY e,\n(78)\nY2G\ne \u2243 30 g1rh\u2217\n1/4 1G\nVPQ0\n\n(76)\n\nwhich implies mainly a lower bound on the parameter \u03bb\nthrough Eqs. (62) and (64). As we emphasize in Sec. II A,\nthis requirement is directly related to the reduction of\ne yield at the onset of nucleosynthesis, Y , to an\nthe G\ne\nG\nacceptable level. Indeed, YG\ne in the case that VPQ0 does\nnot dominate can be estimated [27] as\n\u0001\n\u221212\nT1rh /1010 GeV .\n(77)\nY1G\ne \u2243 1.9 \u00d7 10\n\nWe fix fa = 1012 GeV and \u03bb\u03bc = 0.01 so as to obtain\n\u03bc \u223c 1 TeV. We also set n = 5. These three parameters\nare involved in the determination of T1rh and T2rh \u2013 via\nEq. (62) and (70) respectively \u2013 and play no crucial role\nin the inflationary dynamics. We also choose \u03baa = 0.01\nand \u03bb = 0.1. Variation of \u03baa leads to a variation of s\naccording to Eq. (54) without creating drastic changes\nin the inflationary predictions for M, NHI\u2217 , and ns . On\nthe other hand, \u03bb controls crucially s and T1rh through\nEqs. (54) and (64) and the upper bound on the condition\nof Eq. (10b). Finally, we fix throughout our numerical\ncomputation c = d = e = f = g = 0.1 since these parameters \u2013 contrary to a and b \u2013 have a minor impact on\nthe calculation of m2+ and m2\u2212 . As we show below, the\nselected values above give us a wide and natural allowed\nregion of the remaining fundamental inflationary parameters (\u03ba, M, a, and b). Besides the parameters above, in\nour computation, we use as input parameters the quantities N\u2217 and fHIi = I with f = \u03c3, s, and q. We set\nI \u2243 (1.5\u22124.5)\u00d71017 GeV so as to obtain NHI \u2243 70\u2212100.\nWe then restrict M and N\u2217 so that Eqs. (71) and (73) are\nfulfilled. We check also if the violation of Eqs. (10a) and\nEq. (10b) occurs according to the desired order so that\nour scenario is realized successfully. Using Eqs. (64) and\n(74), we can extract sPQi and ns and compare them with\nthe requirements of Eqs. (76) and (75). For the solutions\npresented below, Eq. (76) is safely fulfilled.\n\n\f10\n\n25\n\n\u03c3\n\ns (10 GeV)\n\n1\n\n16\n\n16\n\n\u03c3, s, q (10 GeV)\n\n30\n10\n\nq\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\ns\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100 120 140 160 180\n\nN\nFIG. 1: The evolution of \u03c3 (black lines), s (gray lines),\nand q (light gray lines) as evaluated via the solution of\nEq.

Crosses\nare obtained by applying our analytical approach for \u03c3HIi =\nsHIi = qHIi = 3 \u00d7 1017 GeV.\n\nThe selected I is to be large enough so that s reaches\nthe attractor of Eq. (54). Under this assumption, our\nresults are independent of the precise I, as can be clearly\ndeduced from Fig. 1, where we plot \u03c3 (black lines and\ncrosses), s (gray lines and crosses), and q (light gray lines)\nas functions of N for \u03ba = 0.002, a = \u22120.0125, b = \u22120.01,\nand \u03c3HIi = sHIi = qHIi = 2.5 \u00d7 1017 GeV (dashed\nlines) or \u03c3HIi = sHIi = qHIi = 3 \u00d7 1017 GeV (solid\nlines and crosses). The lines are drawn by solving numerically Eq. (48), whereas crosses are obtained by employing Eqs. (54) and (59). For both choices of \u03c3HIi =\nsHIi = qHIi 's, we obtain m2\u2212 = \u22120.0136, m2+ = 1.82,\nNHI\u2217 = 52.5, M = 2.86 \u00d7 1016 GeV, ns = 0.963,\n\u03c3HIf = 4.08 \u00d7 1016 GeV, and sHIf = 1.3 \u00d7 1014 GeV although in the first [second] case we obtain Nf = 87.1\n[Nf = 175.5], where Nf is the number of e-foldings\nelapsed from the commencement of FHI until Eq. (10a)\nis violated. It is impressive that M can take a value exactly equal to the SUSY GUT breaking scale, MGUT =\n2.86 \u00d7 1016 GeV, contrary to all other realizations of the\nstandard FHI \u2013 cf. Refs. [2, 19, 24, 36]. Despite the\nfact that T1rh = 4.7 \u00d7 1013 GeV, sPQi /AP fa \u2243 23 and,\ntherefore, a second reheating process is possible which\nresults to T2rh = 3 \u00d7 104 GeV. It is worth emphasizing\n\u22129\n\u221214\nthat Y1G\nwhich\ne \u2243 9 \u00d7 10 , whereas Y2G\ne \u2243 1.9 \u00d7 10\nis consistent with the constraint of Eq. (79). If we set\n\u03bb\u03bc = 0.05, we take \u03bc \u2243 5 TeV, T2rh = 1.5 \u00d7 105 GeV,\n\u221214\nand Y2G\nwhich again falls into the ranges of\ne \u2243 9.5\u00d710\nEq. (79). Finally, we observe that our analytical findings\non \u03c3 are very close to the numerical ones for all N 's. On\nthe contrary, analytical and numerical results on s converge mainly for N \u2243 Nf . Let us clarify that the results\npresented in the following are derived exclusively by our\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n16\n\n\u03c3 (10 GeV)\nFIG. 2: The evolution of \u03c3 and s as evaluated via the solution\nof Eq.

The gray [light gray] region is\nexcluded by Eq. (10a) [Eq. (10b)].\n\nnumerical program.\nAs observed in Fig. 1, immediately after the onset of\nFHI, q decreases sharply and so it does not influence the\ninflationary dynamics. The evolution of the other two\nfields (\u03c3 and s) can be represented in the \u03c3 \u2212 s plane\nas in Fig. 2, where we show the evolution of \u03c3 and s for\nthe parameters used in Fig. 1 and taking \u03c3HIi = sHIi =\n3 \u00d7 1017 GeV (solid line) or \u03c3HIi = sHIi = 2.5 \u00d7 1017 GeV\n(dashed line). There, we draw also the gray [light gray]\nregion which is excluded by Eq. (10a) [Eq. (10b)]. We\nremark that Eq. (10a) is violated earlier and so the preferred hierarchy in the domination of VHI0 or VPQ0 in our\ncosmological proposal is valid \u2013 see Sec. II A.\nThe importance of the coefficient a in reducing ns can\nbe easily concluded from Fig. 3(a), where we depict ns\nversus a for b = \u22120.01 and various \u03ba's indicated in the\ngraph. Increasing the absolute value of a, |m2\u2212 | increases\ntoo and so ns decreases and becomes consistent with the\nobservationally favored range of Eq. (75). On the other\nhand, the same variation of a leads to a reduction of M\nwhich lies around its SUSY GUT value, MGUT , as can\nbe concluded from Fig. 3(b).\nConfronting FHI with all the constraints of Sec. V, we\ncan delineate the allowed (lightly gray shaded) region in\nthe \u03ba \u2212 a [\u03ba \u2212 M ] plane as in Fig. 4(a) [Fig. 4(b)], where\nwe take b = \u22120.01 and show the adopted conventions\nfor the various lines. In particular, the gray dashed [dotted] lines correspond to ns = 0.991 [ns = 0.935], whereas\nthe gray solid lines are obtained by fixing ns = 0.963\n\u2013 see Eq. (75). The black solid lines correspond to\nM = MGUT , whereas beyond the black dashed lines\nthe preferred hierarchy in the violation of Eqs. (10a) and\n(10b) fails. We observe that the latter requirement holds\nonly for \u03ba <\n\u223c \u03bb.

The gray dashed [dotted] lines correspond to the upper [lower] bound on ns in Eq. (75), whereas the gray solid\nlines have been obtained by fixing ns to its central value in Eq. (75). Along the black solid lines, we fix M = MGUT , whereas\nbeyond the black dashed lines the preferred hierarchy in the violation of Eqs. (10a) and (10b) is broken. In the allowed regions,\nEqs.

[20, 23, 24]. This fact can\nbe highlighted in Fig. 5, where we present the variation\nof the inflationary potential VHI as a function of the inflaton field, \u03c3, for the values of the parameters corresponding to the three intersections of the solid black line\nwith the gray lines in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Namely, we take\nM = MGUT , b = \u22120.01, and \u03ba = 0.0036, a = \u22120.0062,\nand \u03c3HIi = sHIi = qHIi = 3 \u00d7 1017 GeV (ns = 0.991,\ndashed line) or \u03ba = 0.002, a = \u22120.0125, and \u03c3HIi =\nsHIi = qHIi = 2.5 \u00d7 1017 GeV (ns = 0.963, solid line) or\n\u03ba = 0.00111, a = \u22120.0189, and \u03c3HIi = sHIi = qHIi =\n\n2 \u00d7 1017 GeV (ns = 0.935, dotted line). The values corresponding to \u03c3\u2217 and \u03c3f are also designed. We observe\nthat for large values of \u03c3, VHI develops an oscillatory\nbehavior due to the initial oscillations of s and q \u2013 see\nFig. 1. However, VHI , for lower \u03c3's, remains monotonic\nand, therefore, no complications arise in the realization\nof the inflationary dynamics.\nLetting b vary for a number of fixed values of a and for\nthe most exciting case with M = MGUT , we can depict\nthe values allowed by all the constraints of Sec. V in the\n\u03ba \u2212 b plane \u2013 see Fig. 6. The various lines terminate\nat low [high] \u03ba's due to the saturation of Eq. (75) from\nbelow [above]. The central ns is obtained at \u03ba \u2243 0.002.\nWe readily conclude that the allowed a's and b's for M =\nMGUT and fixed ns are almost \u03ba-independent. This is\nbecause, for fixed ns , m2\u2212 is fixed too. In particular, for\nns = 0.963, we have m2\u2212 = \u22120.0136, whereas, for ns =\n\n\f12\n\n-0.5\n\nns = 0.991\n\nb = - 0.01\n-2\n\n10\n\n\u03c3*\n\u03c3f\n\n-2\n\n-10\n-3\n\n10\n-0.7\n\na = - 0.0062, \u03ba = 0.0036\na = - 0.0125, \u03ba = 0.002\na = - 0.0189, \u03ba = 0.00111\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n16\n\n\u03c3 (10 GeV)\n\n0.935 [ns = 0.991], we have m2\u2212 \u2243 \u22120.02 [m2\u2212 \u2243 \u22120.008]\nand \u03ba \u2243 0.0036 [\u03ba \u2243 0.0011]. In all cases, m2+ \u2243 1.82.\nFor this reason, we can present in Fig. 7 the allowed\nvalues by Eqs.

The PQPT is tied to renormalizable superpotential terms and the possible catastrophic production of\ndomain walls can be eluded by the introduction of extra\nmatter superfields which can be chosen so that the MSSM\ngauge coupling constant unification is not disturbed. The\ninflaton-like field, associated with PQPT, plays a crucial\nrole in the construction of the K\u00e4hler potential which\nis expanded up to fourth order in powers of the various\nfields. The FHI reproduces the current data on PR and\nns within the power-law \u039bCDM cosmological model and\ngenerates the number of e-folds required from the resolution of the horizon and flatness problems of the SBB.\nThe dynamics of FHI is investigated both numerically\nand analytically and the results are compared with each\nother. Fixing ns to its central value and M to the SUSY\nGUT scale, we concluded that \u03ba = 0.002 with the remaining parameters taking more or less natural values,\n\u00b1(0.01 \u2212 0.1). It is gratifying that our model supports a\nsecond stage of reheating after PQPT, which dilutes suffie abundance so as to become observationally\nciently the G\ne masses even lower than 10 TeV.\nsafe for G\nAcknowledgments\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n-3\n\n\u03ba ( 10 )\nFIG. 6: Allowed values by Eqs.

(A9)\u2013(A12) can be solved, imposing\nthe following initial conditions (the quantities below are\nconsidered functions of the independent variable N\u0304 ):\n\u03c11 (0) = VHI0 , \u03c1R (0) = nG\ne(0) = 0, and \u03c12 (N\u0304PQ ) = VPQ0 ,\n(A14)\nwhere N\u0304PQ is the value of N\u0304 corresponding to the temperature TPQ . Needless to say that we set \u03c12 (N\u0304 ) = 0 for\nN\u0304 < N\u0304PQ .\nIn Fig. 8, we illustrate the cosmological evolution of\nthe quantities log \u03c1i with i = 1 (dotted gray line), i = 2\n(dashed gray line), and i = R (gray line), log VPQ0\n(black dashed line), and log YG\ne (black solid line) as functions of log T for the values of the parameters adopted\nin Fig. 1. In particular, the parameters which determine the evolution of the various quantities during the\npost-inflationary period are \u03ba, \u03bb, M, \u03baa , fa , and \u03bb\u03bc . We\ntake \u03ba = 0.002, \u03bb = 0.1, M = MGUT , \u03baa = 0.01, fa =\n1012 GeV, and \u03bb\u03bc = 0.01. From Fig. 8, we observe that\nFHI is followed successively by the following four epochs:\n(i) a MD era, due to the oscillating and decaying inflaton\nsystem, which lasts until T \u2243 T1rh given by Eq. (62), (ii)\na RD epoch, which terminates at TPQ , (iii) a MD era cre-\n\n\f14\nated by the oscillations of the PQ-system, which is completed at T \u2243 T2rh given by Eq. (70), and (iv) a RD epoch\nafter which the universe enters the SBB phase. The completion of the two reheating processes corresponds to the\ntwo intersections of \u03c11 and \u03c12 with \u03c1R in Fig. 8. Here\nwe omit for simplicity any possible instantaneous domination of VPQ0 over the various energy densities since, as\nwe mention in Sec. IV, VPQ does not support any significant period of inflation. In Fig. 8, we also see that the\ne yield, Y = n /s, takes the value Y \u2243 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22128\nG\ne\ne\ne\nG\n1G\nG\n\u2013 see Eq. (77) \u2013 for T \u2243 T1rh . However, due to the entropy released during the out-of-equilibrium decay of the\n\u221214\nPQ system, YG\ne decreases sharply to Y2G\ne \u2243 3.3 \u00d7 10\n\u2013 see Eq. (78).
