Introduction\nEver since the work of Connes, Douglas, and Schwarz [1] connecting the noncommutative\ntorus and the T-duality in the M theory context appeared in the string/M theory arena,\nthe field related with noncommutaive geometry [2] becomes an industry in the string/M\ntheory circle. Notably, noncommutative torus [3, 4] and its varieties have been studied\nintensively [5, 6, 7, 8]. However, noncommutative versions of the K3 surfaces and the CalabiYau(CY) threefolds have been rarely studied [9, 10, 11] (see also [12, 13, 14]). Only recently,\nnoncommutative tori with complex structures have been studied [15, 16].\nIn Ref.[17], Berenstein, Jejjala, and Leigh initiated an algebraic geometry approach to\nnoncommutative moduli space. Then in Ref.[9], Berenstein and Leigh discussed noncommutative CY threefold from the viewpoint of algebraic geometry. They considered two examples:\na toroidal orbifold T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 and an orbifold of the quintic in CP4 , each with discrete torsion [18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. There, they explained the fractionation of branes at singularities\nfrom noncommutative geometric viewpoint under the presence of discrete torsion.\nIn Ref.[9], Berenstein and Leigh considered the T 6 /Z2 \u00d7 Z2 case and recovered a large\nslice of the moduli space of complex structures of the CY threefold from the deformation of\nthe noncommutative resolution of the orbifolds via central extension of the local algebra of\nholomorphic functions. In the commutative K3 case, the moduli space for the K3 space itself\nhas been known already (see for instance [23]), and even the moduli space for the bundles on\nK3 surfaces has been studied [24]. In the noncommutative deformation of CY threefolds in\nRef.[9], the three holomorphic coordinates yi anticommute with each other to be compatible\nwith Z2 discrete torsion.\nIn our previous work [10], we applied this algebraic approach to K3 surfaces in the\ncases of the orbifolds T 4 /Z2 . We constructed a family of noncommutative K3 surfaces by\nalgebraically deforming T 4 /Z2 in both complex and noncommutative directions altogether.\nIn that construction the dimensions of moduli spaces for the complex structures and the\nnoncommutative deformations were the same 18, which is the dimension of the moduli space\nof the complex structures of K3 surfaces constructed with two elliptic curves.\nHowever, in the commutative case the complete family of complex deformations of K3\n\n2\n\n\fsurfaces is of 20 dimension inside which that of the algebraic K3 surfaces is of 19 dimension\n[23]. Thus, in this papar, we first construct a 19 dimensional family of the noncommutative\nmoduli of general algebraic K3 surfaces by considering algebraic deformation of a pair of K3\nsurfaces. This construction apparently looks similar to the Connes-Lott's \"two-point space\"\nconstruction of the standard model [25]. Thus, we will call it \"two-point deformation\". Next,\nwe extend this method directly to the N-point case by deforming N-tuple of commutative\nalgebraic K3 surfaces embedded in P2 (x1 , x2 ) \u00d7 P1 (t1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P1 (tN ).\nIn section II, we construct a two-point deformation for general algebraic K3 surfaces.\nIn section III, we extend the method to the N-point case. In section IV, we conclude with\ndiscussion.\n\nII. Two-point deformation\nIn this section, we first consider the \"two-point space\" version of noncommutative deformation for general algebraic K3 surfaces in the direct extension of our previous work on\nnoncommutative T 4 /Z2 [10]. General algebraic K3 surfaces are given by the following form\nand with a point added at infinity.\ny 2 = f (x1 , x2 )\n\n(1)\n\nHere f is a function with total degree 6 in x1 , x2 .\nNow, we compare this with the Kummer surface, the orbifold of T 4 /Z2 case [10]. There\nwe considered T 4 as the product of two elliptic curves, each given in Weierstrass form\nyi2 = xi (xi \u2212 1)(xi \u2212 ai )\n\n(2)\n\nwith a point added at infinity for i = 1, 2. By the following change of variables, the point at\ninfinity is brought to a finite point:\nyi\n,\nx2i\n1\nxi \u2212\u2192 x\u2032i = .\nxi\n\nyi \u2212\u2192 yi\u2032 =\n\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fFor algebraic K3 surfaces, we first consider a function with total degree 6 in complex\nvariables u, v, w, for instance\nF (u, v, w) = u2 v 3 w + u4 v 2 .\nIn a patch where the point at infinity of w can be brought to a finite point, this can be\nwritten as\nu\nv\nu\nv\nF\n= ( )2 ( )3 + ( )4 ( )2\n6\nw\nw w\nw w\nand may be denoted as\nf (x1 , x2 ) = x21 x32 + x41 x22\nwhere x1 =\n\nu\n, x2\nw\n\n=\n\nv\n.\nw\n\nThen, an algebraic K3 surface is given by\ny 2 = f (x1 , x2 ) = x21 x32 + x41 x22 .\n\n(4)\n\nSimilarly, in a patch where the point at infinity of u can be brought to a finite point, we\nconsider a function\nv w\nv\nF\n= ( )3 + ( )2 ,\n6\nu\nu u\nu\nand this can be written as\n2\n\n3\n\ny \u2032 = f \u2032 (x\u20321 , x\u20322 ) = x\u20321 x\u20322 + x\u20321\nwhere x\u20321 =\n\nv\nu\n\n=\n\nx2\n, x\u20322\nx1\n\n=\n\nw\nu\n\n=\n\n1\n.\nx1\n\n2\n\n(5)\n\nThis can be also obtained directly from (4) by dividing it\n\nwith x61\ny2\nx2\nx21 x32 x41 x22\nx2 1\n=\n+ 6 = ( )3 + ( )2 .\n6\n6\nx1\nx1\nx1\nx1 x1\nx1\nThus, in the case of the general algebraic K3, a point at infinity in one patch can be brought\nto a finite point in another patch by the following change of variables\ny\n,\nx31\nx2\nx1 \u2212\u2192 x\u20321 = ,\nx1\n1\nx2 \u2212\u2192 x\u20322 = .\nx1\ny \u2212\u2192 y \u2032 =\n\n4\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\fWe now consider a deformation of algebraic K3 surfaces in noncommutative direction.\nFollowing the same reasoning in our previous work [10], we consider two commuting complex\nvariables x1 , x2 and two noncommuting variables t1 , t2 such that\nt21 = h1 (x1 , x2 ),\n\n(8)\n\nt22 = h2 (x1 , x2 ),\nwhere h1 , h2 are commuting functions of total degree 6 in x1 , x2 . To be consistent with the\ncondition that t21 , t22 belong to the center, one can allow the following deformation for t1 , t2 .\nt1 t2 + t2 t1 = P (x1 , x2 )\n\n(9)\n\nHere the right hand side should be a polynomial and free of poles in each patch. Thus, under\nthe change of variables (7)\nx2\n,\nx1\n1\nx2 \u2212\u2192 x\u20322 = ,\nx1\n\nx1 \u2212\u2192 x\u20321 =\n\nti should be changed into\nti \u2212\u2192 t\u2032i =\n\nti\n,\nx31\n\nfor i = 1, 2.\n\n(10)\n\nThis is due to the fact that t's transform just like y in (6). Therefore, P transforms as\nP (x1 , x2 ) \u2212\u2192 x61 P \u2032(\n\nx2 1\n, ).\nx1 x1\n\n(11)\n\nThis implies that P \u2032 should be of total degree 6 in x\u20321 , x\u20322 , at most. Interchanging the role of\nP and P \u2032 one can see that P should be also of total degree 6 in x1 , x2 .\nThe above structure can be understood in the following manner. If we do not impose\nthe condition (9), and if we have only one of ti 's satisfying the condition (8), then we have\nonly one copy of an algebraic K3 surface. If we have both ti 's without the condition (9),\nthen we have two copies of K3 surfaces. If we have both ti 's and impose the condition\n(9), then we have a noncommutatively deformed K3 surfaces in which the above mentioned\ntwo K3 surfaces intertwined each other everywhere on their surfaces, becoming fuzzy. This\nseems to be similar to the \"two-point space\" version of the Connes-Lott model [25]. In the\n5\n\n\fConnes-Lott model, every point of the space becomes fuzzy due to the 1-to-2 correspondence\nat each point in the space, where the two corresponding points at each classical location are\npre-fixed. On the other hand, ours are more or less like position x and momentum p in\nquantum mechanics at every point in the space. However, since we started with two copies\nof the classical space just like the Connes-Lott model, and combined them to become a\nnoncommutative space, we will call our construction \"two-point deformation\" though our\nconstruction is not exactly the same as the Connes-Lott's in its nature.\nNow, we count the dimension of the moduli space of our deformation. In our previous\nwork for noncommutative T 4 /Z2 [10], t1 for y1 y2 and t2 for y2 y1 were all invariants of the\nK3 surface. The dimensions of the moduli spaces of these deformations were 18 for both the\nnoncommutative and complex deformation cases, matching the moduli space dimension of\nthe complex deformation for T 4 /Z2 . In the present case, from eq.(11) we can see that the\ndimension of the moduli spaces of these deformations are 19 for both the noncommutative\nand complex deformation cases. In fact, to show this we need to count the dimension\nof the polynomials of degree 6 in three variables up to constant modulo projective linear\ntransformations of three variables. We get 19 = 28 \u2212 1 \u2212 8, where 28 is the dimension\nof polynomials of degree 6 in three variables and 1 and 8 correspond to a constant and\nP GL(3, C), respectively.\n\nIII. N-point deformation\nIn this section, we follow the method in the previous section and consider the \"N-point\nspace\" of the noncommutative deformation of the general algebraic K3 surfaces.\nFirst, we consider N-tuple of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces\nt21 = h1 (x1 , x2 ),\n..\n.\n\n(12)\n\nt2N = hN (x1 , x2 ),\nwhere h1 , * * * , hN are commuting functions of total degree 6 in x1 , x2 . This can be regarded\nas embedding the i-th copy of algebraic K3 surface Xi in P2 (x1 , x2 ) \u00d7 P1 (ti ) as t2i = hi (x1 , x2 )\n6\n\n\fof a degree 6 polynomial. Locally the algebra representing the functions on Xi can be\nexpressed as C[x1 , x2 , ti ]/Ii , where Ii is a principal ideal generated by t2i \u2212 hi (x1 , x2 ) and\nC[x1 , x2 , t1 , * * * , tN ] is a local polynomial algebra of P2 (x1 , x2 ) \u00d7 P1 (t1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P1 (tN ). Thus\nembedding Xi in P2 (x1 , x2 ) \u00d7 P1 (t1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P1 (tN ) induces a natural quotient map from\nC[x1 , x2 , t1 , * * * , tN ] to C[x1 , x2 , ti ]/Ii by putting tj as 0 for j 6= i.\nNow, we consider the deformation of this embedded space in the noncommutative direction as in the two-point case. In order to be consistent with the condition that t21 , * * * , t2N\nbelong to the center along with x1 , x2 , we can allow the following deformation for t1 , * * * , tN .\nti tj + tj ti = Pij (x1 , x2 ),\n\nfor i, j = 1, * * * , N, i 6= j.\n\n(13)\n\nHere the right hand side should be a polynomial and free of poles in each patch. Thus, under\nthe change of variables (7)\nx2\n,\nx1\n1\nx2 \u2212\u2192 x\u20322 = ,\nx1\n\nx1 \u2212\u2192 x\u20321 =\n\nti 's should be changed into\nti \u2212\u2192 t\u2032i =\n\nti\n,\nx31\n\nfor i = 1, * * * , N.\n\n(14)\n\nThis is due to the fact that ti 's transform just like y in (6). Therefore, Pij transforms as\nPij (x1 , x2 ) \u2212\u2192 x61 Pij\u2032 (\n\nx2 1\n, ).\nx1 x1\n\n(15)\n\nThis implies that Pij\u2032 should be of total degree 6 in x\u20321 , x\u20322 , at most. Interchanging the role\nof Pij and Pij\u2032 one can see that Pij should be also of total degree 6 in x1 , x2 .\nIf we forget the embedded N K3 surfaces given by the constraints (12) for the time\nbeing, the above defined {Pij (x1 , x2 )} given by (13) define a deformation of the ambient\nspace P2 (x1 , x2 ) \u00d7 P1 (t1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P1 (tN ). So, we can understand that imposing the condition\nof the change of chart (14),(15) compatible to the complex structures coming from (12)\ninduces a restriction on Pij being of total degree 6 in x1 , x2 . We might call this deformation\na deformation of N K3 surfaces. The choice of Pij is independent of the choice of hi , which\nmeans that the deformations of the classical complex structure and of the noncommutative\n7\n\n\fstructure are independent of each other as expected. Now, we count the dimension of\nthe moduli space of our deformation. In the two-point case of the previous section, the\ndimension of the moduli space of the deformation was 19. In that case, we counted the\ndimension of the polynomials of degree 6 in three variables up to constant modulo projective\nlinear transformations of three variables. Thus, we got 19 = 28 \u2212 1 \u2212 8, where 28 is the\ndimension of polynomials of degree 6 in three variables and 1 and 8 correspond to a constant\nand P GL(3, C), respectively. Thus, in the N-point case the dimension of the moduli space\nof the deformation is the number of independent Pij times the deformation dimension of the\ntwo-point case. Namely, we have 19N(N-1)/2 as the dimension of the deformation moduli\nfor the N-point deformation case.\n\nIV. Discussion\nIn this paper, we deformed N K3 surfaces in the noncommutative sense and computed the\ndimension for the moduli space.\nIn the first part of the paper, we constructed the two-point deformation of algebraic K3\nsurfaces by considering algebraic deformation of a pair of commutative algebraic K3 surfaces.\nDoing this, we used the same method as in the case of the Kummer K3 surface[10] which\nis the Z2 quotient of two elliptic curves E1 , E2 where Ei satisfies yi2 = fi (xi ). In Ref.[10],\nwe defined t1 = y1 y2 , t2 = y2 y1 and introduced the deformation t1 t2 + t2 t1 = P12 (x1 , x2 ). In\nthat case t1 , t2 were functions on the Kummer K3 surface, so that the deformation was a\nnoncommutative deformation of one Kummer K3 surface. However, the moduli dimension\nof that deformation was of 18 [10], not the same as the moduli dimension of algebraic K3\nsurfaces. Here, we recovered the same moduli dimension of deformation, 19 by algebraically\ndeforming a pair of algebraic K3 surfaces in a manner similar to the Connes-Lott construction\n[25].\nThen we considered the extension of this method to the N-point case. Notice that\nin the N-point deformation case, tj in the ti tj + tj ti = Pij (x1 , x2 ) is not a function on\nthe i-th copy of commutative K3 surface Xi for i 6= j. Rather this can be thought of as\nnoncommutative deformation of N K3 surfaces or a noncommutative deformation of the\n\n8\n\n\fambient space P2 (x1 , x2 ) \u00d7 P1 (t1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 P1 (tN ) compatible to the complex structure of each\nK3 surface. In the N-point case, we obtained 19N(N-1)/2 as the dimension of deformation\nmoduli.\nWhen N=3, it is interesting whether we can find an analogue of the classical hyperk\u00e4hler\nstructure of K3 surface. First, we recall the property of the moduli space of Ricci flat metrics\non a K3 surface S. If a given metric g satisfies g(Jv, Jw) = g(v, w) for any tangent vector\nv, w, then we say that the metric g is compatible with the complex structure J. If the two\nform \u03a9(*, *) = g(J*, *) is closed, then it is called a K\u00e4hler metric and \u03a9 is called a K\u00e4hler\nform. Any given Ricci-flat metric g induces a Hodge \u2217 operator on H 2 (S, R) \u223c\n= R3,19 by which\nH 2 (S, R) can be decomposed as a direct sum of two eigenspaces, self dual part (eigenvalue\n1) of dimension 3 and anti-self dual part (eigenvalue \u22121) of dimension 19.\nIn this setting, for the given Ricci-flat metric g, the self dual part \u039b+ is a 3-dimensional\nreal vector space consisting of vectors whose self intersection is positive. Different compatible\nstructrues J to g correspond to different unit vectors in \u039b+ , and they form S 2 isomorphic\nto P1 . Here we choose 3 orthogonal unit vectors \u03a91 , \u03a92 , \u03a93 in \u039b+ such that corresponding\ncomplex structures J1 , J2 , J3 satisfy the relation Ji Jj = \u01ebijk Jk for i, j, k = 1, 2, 3. This is\ncalled a hyperk\u00e4hler structure on S. We wonder whether we can see the 3-point deformaiton\ncase as the deformation of this hyperk\u00e4hler structure on S by relating ti 's with Ji 's.\nFr\u00f6hlich et al [26, 27] defined a spectral triple for this hyperk\u00e4hler case introducing the\ni\n\noperators \u2202, \u2202, T i , T , i = 1, 2, 3 acting on the differential forms. Here, \u2202 = 21 (D \u2212 iD),\nwhere D is the Dirac operator and T i , i = 1, 2, 3 are operators coming from the hyperk\u00e4hler\nstructure. Then they extended this definition to the noncommutative case. We also wonder\nwhether we can relate our ti with their Ti .\nFinally, we wonder whether we can find a sort of Clifford structures on P2 (x1 , x2 ) with the\nfiber P1 (t1 )\u00d7* * *\u00d7P1 (tN ). This may be considered by regarding ti tj +tj ti = Pij (x1 , x2 ), i, j =\n1, * * * , N, i 6= j and t2i = hi (x1 , x2 ), i = 1, * * * , N, not as constraints giving noncommutative\ndeformation and complex structures for K3 surfaces but as the components of a symmetric\nmatrix giving the metric on the fiber.\n\n9\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by KOSEF Interdisciplinary Research Grant No. R01-200000022.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
