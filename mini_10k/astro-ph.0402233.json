The CXB spectrum is consistent with a power law having a photon\nindex \u0393 = 1.41 \u00b1 0.06, with a 2-10 keV flux of (2.24\u00b10.16)\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\ndeg\u22121 (90% confidence level, including the absolute flux calibration uncertainty).\nOur results are in excellent agreement with two of the most recent CXB measurements, performed with BeppoSAX LECS/MECS data (Vecchi et al. 1999)\nand with an independent analysis of XMM-Newton EPIC/MOS data (Lumb et\nal. 2002), providing a very strong constrain to the absolute sky surface brightness\nin this energy range, so far affected by a \u223c40% uncertainty.

Later observations\nhave demonstrated that the bulk of Cosmic\nX-ray Background (CXB) above energies of\n\u22482 keV is of extragalactic origin, due to\nsources below the detection threshold. The\nfirst wide band measures of the CXB were\nmade by HEAO\u22121 (1977): the CXB spec-\n\n\f2\n\nA. De Luca & S. Molendi: EPIC Cosmic X-ray Background Spectrum\n\ntrum in the 2\u00f710 keV range was well described by a simple power law with photon\nindex \u2248 1.4 (Marshall et al. 1980). More\nrecently, several measurements of the CXB\nspectrum have been obtained at energies\nbelow 10 keV. While the results on the\nspectral shape confirmed a power law with\n\u0393 \u223c 1.4, the normalization of the CXB remained highly uncertain as a consequence\nof large discrepancies (well beyond the statistical errors) among the different determinations. A difference as large as \u223c 40%\nis found from the highest measured value\n(Vecchi et al. 1999, using SAX data) to\nthe lowest one (the original HEAO-1 experiment, Marshall et al. 1980).\nBarcons et al. (2000) showed that cosmic\nvariance cannot account for the differences\namong the previous measures of the CXB\nintensity, concluding that systematic errors and cross-calibration differences must\nhave some role. Measurements published\nafter the analysis of Barcons et al. (2000),\nnamely Lumb et al. (2002) with XMMNewton EPIC and Kushino et al. (2002)\nwith ASCA/GIS, while differing by \u223c15%\nonly, either because of the small covered\nsolid angle (Lumb et al. 2002), or because of\nlarge uncertainties in the stray light assessment (Kushino et al. 2002), do not allow to\nconstrain the value of the CXB normalization to a much narrower range.\nSuch an uncertainty on the intensity represents a severe limit to the definition of\na big picture, explaining which are the\nsources of the CXB and constraining their\ncosmological properties, in spite of the\nwealth of information coming from the\ndeep pencil-beam X-ray surveys (Chandra\nDeep Field North, Brandt et al. 2001;\nChandra Deep Field South, Giacconi et\nal. 2002), medium-deep wide angle Xray surveys (HELLAS2XMM, Baldi et al.\n2002) and their multiwavelength follow-up\nCampaigns. Even a basic information such\nas the resolved fraction of the CXB cannot\nbe firmly evaluated.\nWe have obtained a new measurement of\nthe CXB spectrum in the 2-8 keV range\n\nwith the EPIC/MOS1 cameras onboard\nXMM-Newton. Our study of the CXB is\nbased on a large sample of high galactic\nlatitude pointings for a total solid angle\nof \u223c5.5 square degrees, reducing the effects of cosmic variance. Our analysis includes a very robust characterization of the\ninstrumental background properties, which\nis crucial for a robust measurement of the\nfaintest diffuse source of the X-ray sky.\nHere we shall briefly report on some highlights of our study. The reader is referred to\nDe Luca & Molendi (2004) for more details.\n\n2. The EPIC/MOS instrumental\nbackground\nThe EPIC/MOS cameras (Turner et al.,\n2001) have appropriate characteristics to\nstudy extended sources with low surface\nbrighteness, offering a large collecting area\n(\u2248 cm2 ) and good spectral resolution (2%\n@ 6 keV) over a broad energy range\n(0.2\u00f712 keV) and a wide field of view (\u2248 15\narcmin radius). However such detectors suffer a rather high instrumental background\n(Non X-ray Background, NXB).\n\n2.1. Different components of the MOS\nNXB\nThe EPIC NXB can be divided into two\nparts: an electronic noise component, which\nis important only at the lower energies (below \u22480.3 keV), and a particle-induced component which dominates above 0.3 keV and\nis due to the interaction of particles in the\norbital environment with the detectors and\nthe structures that surround them. The\nparticle-induced NXB is the sum of two different components:\n\u2013 Low energy particles (E\u223c a few tens of\nkeV) accelerated in the Earth magnetosphere can reach the detectors scattering through the telescope mirrors, generating events which are almost indistinguishable from valid X-ray photons.\n1\nthe pn camera, having different characteristics, will require a different approach\n\n\fA. De Luca & S. Molendi: EPIC Cosmic X-ray Background Spectrum\n\nWhen a concentrated cloud of such particles is channeled by the telescope mirrors to the focal plane, a sudden increase (up to three orders of magnitude)\nof the quiescent count rate is observed\n(the so-called \"soft proton flares\") An\nextreme time variability (time scale\nranging from \u223c 100 s to several hours) is\nthe fingerprint of this background component; it will be hereafter called the\n\"flaring\" NXB or \"Soft Proton\" (SP)\nNXB.\nAn additional component of background can be generated by a steady\nflux of low energy particles, reaching the\ndetectors through the telescope optics\nat a uniform rate.\n\u2013 High energy particles (E> a few MeV)\ngenerate a signal which is mostly discarded on-board on the basis of an\nupper energy thresholding and of a\nPATTERN analysis of the events (see\ne.g. Lumb et al. 2002). The unrejected\npart of this signal represent an important component of the MOS NXB. Its\ntemporal behaviour is driven by the flux\nof energetic particles; its variability has\ntherefore a time scale much larger than\nthe length of a typical observation. We\nwill refer to this NXB component as to\nthe \"quiescent\" background.\n\n2.2. How to deal with the MOS NXB\nIt is quite easy to identify the flaring background: a light curve can immediately show\nthe time intervals affected by an high background count rate. Such intervals are unusable for the analysis of faint diffuse sources\nand have to be rejected with the so-called\nGood Time Interval (GTI) filtering.\nAfter the application of the GTI, a residual component of soft proton background\nmay survive. Low-amplitude flares, yielding little variations to the quiescent count\nrate, could be missed by the GTI threshold. Moreover, a slow time variability could\nhamper the identification of a \"flare\" by\nmeans of a time variability analysis. In such\ncases the unrejected NXB component may\n\n3\n\nbe revealed with a surface brightness analysis. As stated before, low energy particles\nare focused by the mirrors and therefore\nthe spatial distribution of the induced NXB\nvaries across the plane of the detectors. A\nrather large portion of the MOS detectors\nis not exposed to the sky (hereafter called\n\"out Field Of View\", out FOV) and therefore neither cosmic X-ray photons nor low\nenergy particle induced events are collected\nthere. A comparison of the out FOV and in\nFOV surface brightness allows to identify\nand reject the observations affected by an\nanomalous low-energy particle NXB.\nThe final step required to remove the effects of NXB is to account for the quiescent component. The only way to solve the\nproblem is to get an independent measurement of its spectrum. Its subtraction from\nthe total (CXB+quiescent NXB) spectrum\nyields the pure CXB spectrum. The crucial problem is that the NXB spectrum, resulting from a non-symultaneous measurement, must be representative of the actual quiescent NXB which is present in a\ntypical observation of the sky. There are\ntwo ways to measure the quiescent NXB\nin the MOS. Firstly, through the analysis\nof the out FOV regions, where neither Xray photons nor soft protons can reach the\nfocal plane through reflections/scatterings\nby the telescope optics. Secondly, through\nthe study of the observations with the filter wheel in closed position: an aluminium\nwindow prevents X-ray photons and low energy particles from reaching the detectors.\nOur analysis (see De Luca & Molendi 2004\nfor details) fully confirmed the feasibility\nof such approach, favouring the choice of\nthe closed observations over the out FOV,\nas the former provides an NXB spectrum\nbetter suited to study the CXB.\n\n3. Data preparation and analysis\nOur study is based on a rather large sample of MOS data including calibration,\nperformance verification and granted time\nobservations; public observations retrieved\nthrough the XMM-Newton Science Archive\n\n\f4\n\nA. De Luca & S. Molendi: EPIC Cosmic X-ray Background Spectrum\n\nFig. 1. The cosmic X-ray background spectrum in the 2-8 keV range is displayed,\nfolded with the instrumental response.\nMOS1 data are represented in red, MOS2\nin black. The best fit model is overplotted.\nThe lower panel shows the residuals in units\nof sigma.\nfacility were also used. The initial dataset\nconsist of a compilation of (mostly) blank\nsky fields observations and a list of observations performed with the filter wheel\nin closed position. We selected only high\ngalactic latitude fields (|b| \u2265 28\u25e6 ). We\navoided pointings towards the Magellanic\nClouds, Cluster of Galaxies, as well as observations of very bright targets. The selected fields were observed between revolution number 57 and revolution number\n437. We retrieved the closed observations\nperformed in the same time interval, between revolution 25 and 462. In our analysis\nwe included all of the serendipitous sources\ndetected in the sky fields. We cut out only\nthe bright target (if any) of the observation\nin order to get an unbiased measure of the\nCXB.\nWe have developed an ad-hoc pipeline to\nperform the different steps of the analysis,\nfrom raw data to the extraction of the spectra, in an automated way. A detailed description of such algorithm is given by De\nLuca & Molendi (2004) and will not be reported here.\n\n4. Spectral analysis and results\nThe final dataset includes 42 sky fields for\nthe MOS1 camera and 43 for the MOS2.\n\nThe total exposure time is of \u223c1.15 Ms\nper camera. The solid angle covered by the\ndata, summing the contribution of each observation (accounting for the differences in\nfield of view due to the readout mode or to\nthe excision of the central target) is of \u223c5.5\nsquare degrees (34 different pointing directions) per camera. The closed data amount\nto \u223c430 ksec per camera.\nThe 2-8 keV range was selected for the\nanalysis. Lower energies were not used to\navoid (i) contaminations by the soft galactic component of the CXB (emerging below\n\u223c1 keV) and (ii) possible artefacts due to\nan imperfect subtraction of the bright internal Al-K and Si-K fluorescence lines in\nthe 1-2 keV range. Above 8 keV the collected CXB signal is marginal.\nThe spectral analysis was performed within\nXSPEC v11.0. The spectral model was a\nsimple absorbed power law. The interstellar\nabsorption NH was fixed to the exposureweighted average of the values of the selected fields.\nThe spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background as seen by the MOS instruments\nis shown in Fig. 1. The two cameras yield\nfully consistent results within the statistical uncertainties. A symultaneous fit to the\ndata (\u03c72\u03bd = 1.15, 72 d.o.f.) yields a photon\nindex of 1.41\u00b10.04 and a normalization of\n2.647\u00b10.038 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121\nat 3 keV (to be corrected for the stray light,\ni.e. the contribution to the collected flux\ndue to photons coming from out-of-field angles). The quoted uncertainties are the statistical errors at the 90% confidence level\nfor a single interesting parameter.\nA careful study of the possible sources of\nerrors (see De Luca & Molendi, 2004) led\nus to compute the overall uncertainty (systematics included) to be of 4% for the photon index and of 3.5% for the normalization.\nAfter correcting for the stray light (7\u00b12%\nof the collected flux, according to Lumb et\nal. 2002), the MOS results on the 2-8 keV\nCXB spectrum are:\n\u0393 = 1.41 \u00b1 0.06\n\n\fA. De Luca & S. Molendi: EPIC Cosmic X-ray Background Spectrum\n\nN = 2.462 \u00b1 0.086\nwhere the normalization N is expressed in\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 at 3 keV.\nThe resulting flux in the 2-10 keV energy\nrange is of (2.24\u00b10.16)\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122\ns\u22121 deg\u22122 . The error (90% confidence) includes also an extra 5% uncertainty as an\nestimate of the absolute flux calibration\naccuracy of the MOS cameras. To ease a\ncomparison with previous works, the corresponding normalization at 1 keV is of \u223c11.6\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 keV\u22121 .\n\n5. Discussion\nWe have plotted in Figure 2 our measurement of the CXB intensity, together with\nprevious determinations. Our value is fully\ncompatible with the results of Vecchi et al.\n(1999) on BeppoSAX LECS/MECS data\n(total solid angle \u03a9 \u223c 0.77 square degrees) and with the independent analysis of\nXMM-Newton EPIC/MOS data by Lumb\net al. (2002) (\u03a9 \u223c 1.2 square degrees).\nThe ASCA/GIS measure of Kushino et al.\n(2002) is marginally consistent with ours.\nSuch study was performed over a rather\nlarge solid angle (\u03a9 \u223c 50 square degrees)\nbut the absolute flux determination accuracy was limited to 10% by the large stray\nlight component (\u223c 40% of the collected\nflux) affecting ASCA data. Very recently,\nRevnivtsev et al. (2003) published a new\nmeasurement of the CXB spectrum performed with the PCA instrument onboard\nRXTE, reporting an intensity consistent\nwith the results of Kushino et al. (2002).\nThey used data from nearly all the sky\n(\u03a9 \u223c 2.2 104 square degrees); the instrumental background spectrum was extracted\nfrom only 25 ksec of dark Earth observation. The original HEAO-1 measurement\n(Marshall et al., 1980) is significantly lower\nthan ours. Such measurement is very robust as for solid angle coverage (\u03a9 \u223c 104\nsquare degrees); however, all of the subsequent determinations yielded invariably\nhigher values of the CXB intensity, casting\nsome doubts on the absolute flux calibration of the HEAO-1 instruments.\n\n5\n\nIn our analysis, we used a compilation of\nsky fields covering a solid angle of \u223c 5.5\nsquare degrees, reducing the cosmic variance below the overall quoted uncertainty.\nOur measurement, performed with the\nwell-calibrated EPIC/MOS instrument, relies on a very careful study and subtraction\nof the NXB, as well as on a detailed analysis\nof all the possible sources of errors. In conclusion, we believe that our measure, fully\nconsistent with two of the most recent CXB\ndeterminations, set a very strong constrain\non the CXB intensity in the 2-8 keV range,\nsignificantly higher than the former result\nfrom HEAO-1 data, assumed more than 20\nyears ago as a reference.\nWe can now compare our value of the\nCXB intansity with the source number\ncounts derived from recent X-ray surveys, both deep/pencil-beam and mediumdeep/wide-angle (Moretti et al., 2003).\nOur measurement of the CXB intensity,\nFCXB =(2.24\u00b10.10)\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\ndeg\u22121 (1\u03c3 error, including the absolute flux\nuncertainty), implies that 80+7\n\u22126 % of the\ncosmic X-ray background has been resolved\ninto discrete sources in the 2-10 keV band.\nThe resolved fraction rises only to \u223c84%\nwhen extrapolating the LogN/LogS down\nto fluxes of \u223c 10\u221217 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 , a factor of 10 below the sensitivity limits of the\ndeepest X-ray surveys. Such a result suggests the existence of a new class of X-ray\nsources (possibly heavily absorbed AGNs,\nor star-forming galaxies, see Moretti et al.\n2003 and references therein) emerging at\nfluxes fainter than 10\u221216 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 and\naccounting for the remaining part of unresolved CXB.\n\nReferences\nBaldi, A., Molendi, S., Comastri, A., et al.\n2002, ApJ, 564, 190\nBarcons, X., Mateos, S. & Ceballos, M.T.\n2000, MNRAS, 316, L13\nBrandt,\nW.N.,\nAlexander,\nD.M.,\nHornschemeier, A.E., et al. 2001, AJ, 122,\n2810\n\n\f6\n\nA.
