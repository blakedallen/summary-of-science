It is\nnecessary to clarify nonperturbative phenomena of the QCD vacuum composed of\nquarks, anti-quarks and gluon fields interacting in a highly complicated way. Topological properties may provide a useful approach for descriptions of the nonperturbative nature of QCD, although the usual perturbative expansion is not applicable\nin this infrared region. The instanton solution 1) is actually related to the UA (1)\nanomaly and large \u03b7 \u2032 mass. 2) Witten and Veneziano derived an approximate relation between the \u03b7 \u2032 mass and topological susceptibility in the context of the 1/Nc\nexpansion. 3), 4) Chiral symmetry breaking could also be interpreted as an instanton\neffect. 5) - 7)\nWith recent progress in computational capabilities, the direct investigation of\ninstanton properties in the QCD vacuum using lattice QCD simulations has become practicable. 8) - 15) Elucidating instanton physics is important in order to understand the nonperturbative QCD vacuum. A cooling procedure can be adopted\nto eliminate short-range quantum fluctuations and extract only topological excitations. 8) Instantons seem to appear as deformed configurations even after cool-\n\n\f2\n\nM. Fukushima, H. Suganuma and S. Chiba\n\ning. The vacuum structure of non-Abelian gauge theories has been studied by\nSavvidy employing the background field method. 16) In the SU (2) Yang-Mills theory, the effective potential up to one loop order for an Abelian gauge field leads to\na nonzero constant color magnetic field instead of the perturbative vacuum. Following Savvidy's work, the Copenhagen group described the QCD vacuum including\nthe effect of the inhomogeneous magnetic structure. 17) - 19) Lattice QCD simulations\nyield an average instanton size \u03c1\u0304 \u2243 (0.33 \u2212 0.4) fm and an instanton number density\n(N/V ) \u223c hG\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd /32\u03c0 2 i \u2243 1 fm\u22124 , corresponding to the gluon condensate. 8) - 15), 20)\nThe QCD vacuum contains the gluon condensate and the inhomogeneous magnetic\nfield. The 't Hooft ansatz is not a solution of the Yang-Mills equation in the presence of such a background field, and therefore the position, size, color orientation\nand 4-dimensional shape of each instanton are altered by the field. In this paper,\nwe study the instanton deformation mechanism by deriving a stabilized instanton\nsolution that corresponds to a minimum Yang-Mills action in the external field.\nRecent studies have revealed the remarkable fact that instantons have a one-toone correspondence with monopoles in the Abelian gauge, although these topological\nobjects belong to different homotopy groups. 21) - 26) This correspondence may provide a scenario of a color confinement mechanism that the instanton fields give rise to\nthe multi-production of monopole loops as a signal of monopole condensation. 24), 25)\nFor this reason, we further investigate the appearance of monopoles around the instanton as a deformed configuration in external color magnetic fields.\n\u00a72.\n\nInstantons in an external field\n\nThe instanton is a classical nontrivial solution of the Euclidean Yang-Mills field\nequations with a finite action, which was discovered by Belavin, Polyakov, Schwartz\nand Tyupkin. 1), 27), 28) The appearance of instantons corresponds to the homotopy\ngroup \u03a03 (SU (Nc )) = Z\u221e . 27) In Minkowski space, instantons are interpreted as tunneling events among degenerate vacua that are labeled by different winding numbers.\nThe Euclidean Yang-Mills action is written\n1\nS= 2\n2g\n\nZ\n\nd4 xtr (G\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere G\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 [D\u03bc , D\u03bd ] = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ] is the field strength. 27) Here, to\nsimplify the notation, the field strength and the gauge field are defined as G\u03bc\u03bd \u2261\niGa\u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 a /2 and A\u03bc \u2261 iAa\u03bc \u03c4 a /2. By defining the dual field strength as G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 12 \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 G\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nwe can rewrite the action as\nS=\n\n1\n8g2\n\nZ\n\nd4 x{Ga\u03bc\u03bd \u00b1 G\u0303a\u03bc\u03bd }2 \u2213\n\n8\u03c0 2\nQ.\ng2\n\n(2.2)\n\nFrom this formula, the action\nprovides a minimal value characterized by the topologiR\ncal charge Q \u2261 (1/32\u03c0 2 ) d4 xGa\u03bc\u03bd G\u0303a\u03bc\u03bd when the field strength satisfies the (anti)selfdual condition Ga\u03bc\u03bd = \u00b1G\u0303a\u03bc\u03bd . This self-dual relation satisfies the Yang-Mills field\nequation automatically, as [D\u03bc , G\u03bc\u03bd ] = \u00b1[D\u03bc , G\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ] = 0, due to the Jacobi identity.\n\n\f3\n\nInstanton and Monopole in External Chromomagnetic Fields\n\nThe instanton solution is well known as the 't Hooft ansatz. 27), 28) The single\ninstanton solution with Q = 1 is written\nAI(s)\n\u03bc (x) =\n\n2iOab \u03b7\u0304 b\u03bc\u03bd (x \u2212 z)\u03bd \u03c12 \u03c4 a\n(x \u2212 z)2 {(x \u2212 z)2 + \u03c12 } 2\n\n(2.3)\n\nin the singular gauge. The SU (2) instanton has 8 collective coordinates corresponding to the size \u03c1, the 4-dim central position z\u03bc , and the global orientation Oab in\ncolor space. Here, \u03b7b\u03bc\u03bd denotes the 't Hooft symbol, 27) defined as\n\u03b7\u0304 b\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03b7\u0304 b\u03bd\u03bc \u2261\n\u03bc4\n\n(\n\n\u03b5b\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u2212\u03b4b\u03bc ,\n\n(\u03bc, \u03bd = 1, 2, 3)\n(\u03bd = 4)\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u03bd4\n\nwith \u03b7b\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 (\u22121)\u03b4 +\u03b4 \u03b7\u0304b\u03bc\u03bd . The anti-instanton with Q = \u22121 can be obtained by\nreplacing \u03b7\u0304a\u03bc\u03bd with \u03b7a\u03bc\u03bd in Eq. (2.3). The single instanton action density has a\npoint-like peak at its center with the 4-dimensional rotational symmetry O(4) in the\nspace-time R4 .\nThe QCD vacuum contains, for instance, instanton and anti-instanton fields,\nthe gluon condensate and inhomogeneous magnetic fields, as in the Copenhagen\nvacuum, and so on. Therefore, we would like to study the effects of background\nfields on classical configurations like instantons. For simplicity, it is convenient to\nconsider a translationally invariant external field. In the SU (2) case, there are two\ncategories of such external fields. By employing a suitable gauge, one is reduced to\na QED-like case, and the other is reduced to a constant A1\u03bc and A2\u03bd case, which lead\n3 \u221d [A1 , A2 ]. In this work, we consider the QED-like\nto a constant field strength F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\ncase as an idealized external field. We use an external gauge field given by\n1\n1\nA3ex\n(2.5)\nA\u03bc\u00b1ex \u2261 \u221a (A1\u03bc \u00b1 iA2\u03bc ) = 0,\n\u03bc = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd x\u03bd ,\n2\n2\n3\n\nwhich leads to a constant Abelian field strength G\u03bc\u03bd = iF\u03bc\u03bd \u03c42 . Here, F\u03bc\u03bd \u2208 R is a\nconstant anti-symmetric tensor.\nIn the presence of an external field, the 't Hooft ansatz is no longer a solution of\nthe Yang-Mills field equation. Therefore, we would like to find the instanton solution\nthat minimizes the total action in external fields. First of all, we construct the total\ngauge field as a superposition of the instanton field and the external field:\nex\nI\nAtot\n\u03bc (x) = A\u03bc (x) + A\u03bc (x).\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe total Yang-Mills action given by this simple superposed configuration would\nbe shifted from the absolute minimum due to the overlapping between Aex\n\u03bc and\nAI\u03bc . Therefore, we derive a stabilized solution with nontrivial topological sector\nthat minimizes the total Yang-Mills action by employing a variational analysis with\nrespect to the instanton configuration AI\u03bc .\n\u00a73.\n\nMinimization of total instanton action under an external field\n\nAs the degrees of freedom of the variational space, we consider (i) the global\ncolor orientation O ab , (ii) the anisotropic scale transformation \u03bb\u03bc , and (iii) the local\n\n\f4\n\nM. Fukushima, H. Suganuma and S. Chiba\n\ngauge-like transformation \u03a9 a (x) of the instanton configuration. Certainly, the action of an isolated single instanton is independent of O and \u03a9(x) due to the gauge\ninvariance. However, the total action depends directly on these variables in the presence of external fields. We should start from the global variables and then perform\nthe minimization locally in order to find the position of absolute minimum in this\nvariational space. In the actual calculation, we determine Oab , \u03bb\u03bc and \u03a9(x) in turn\nby minimizing the total Yang-Mills action with respect to each.\n3.1. Global color orientation\nFirst, we minimize the total action with respect to the global color orientation\nO ab . A single instanton has collective coordinates concerning the global rotation in\nthe SU (2) color space given by\n\uf8ee\n\n\u2212sin \u03c8 sin \u03c6+cos \u03c8 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6\n\uf8ef\nO \u2261 \uf8f0 \u2212cos \u03c8 sin \u03c6\u2212sin \u03c8 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6\nsin \u03b8 cos \u03c6\n\n\uf8f9\n\nsin \u03c8 cos \u03c6+cos \u03c8 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6 \u2212cos \u03c8 sin \u03b8\n\uf8fa\ncos \u03c8 cos \u03c6\u2212sin \u03c8 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6 sin \u03c8 sin \u03b8 \uf8fb ,\nsin \u03b8 sin \u03c6\ncos \u03b8\n(3.1)\n\nwhich is characterized by the three Euler angles \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0] and \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). In the\nabsence of external fields, the global O(4) symmetry is manifest, and these variables\nare irrelevant to the action. However, if there is an external field breaking the 4dimensional space-time symmetry, these Euler angles would be determined from the\ncondition of a minimal total action.\n3.2. Anisotropic scale transformation\nAs the next step, we carry out an anisotropic scale transformation of the instanton configuration as\nx \u03bc \u2192 \u03bb\u03bc x \u03bc .\n(3.2)\nHere, \u03bb\u03bc are the global rescale parameters acting on the coordinates x\u03bc along the\ndirection \u03bc. This anisotropic scale transformation directly affects the instanton profile, which is not done by a transformation of the gauge degrees of freedom of the\ninstanton configuration. Here, we impose the condition \u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u03bb3 \u03bb4 = 1 and fix the\n4-dimensional volume of the instanton profile in terms of the characteristic scale \u03c1\u0304.\nAt this point, we should give a comment on the size of an instanton. Generally, the\noverlapping between an instanton and the background field increases the total action\ndensity. A larger size of the instantons leads to a much larger increase of the action,\nand the stability of a finite size instanton is not certain in a uniform external field.\nHowever, in the QCD vacuum, instantons and anti-instantons of a characteristic size\nand density have been observed using lattice QCD simulations. 8) - 15), 20) It has been\nfound also in the simplified instanton gas model that the instanton size distribution\nhas a peak at a characteristic instanton size. 29) With these results in mind, we here\nimpose the above condition by hand and consider only the deformation effect on an\ninstanton in such a characteristic size. The breaking of the O(4) symmetry due to\nexternal fields leads to a nontrivial condition of \u03bb\u03bc , which minimize the total action.\n\n\f5\n\nInstanton and Monopole in External Chromomagnetic Fields\n3.3. Local gauge-like transformation\n\nUntil this point, we have considered only the global parameters of the instanton\nconfiguration. The self-duality of an instanton solution is generally broken in the\npresence of an external field, and the true minimum of the total action cannot be\nrealized through a global transformation alone for such a self-dual initial configuration. For this reason, we also consider the local minimization of the total action\nconsidering gauge-like degrees of freedom of the instanton configuration. We formulate the gauge-like transformation as follows. In the construction of the total gauge\nfields, there is an ambiguity of the \"gauge-like choice\" of AI\u03bc (x) as\n\u2032\n\nAI\u03bc (x) = \u03a9(x)(AI\u03bc (x) + \u2202\u03bc )\u03a9 \u2020 (x),\n\n(3.3)\n\nin the presence of an external Aex\n\u03bc (x), whose gauge degrees of freedom are fixed as\n\u2032\n\nex\nAex\n\u03bc (x) = A\u03bc (x).\n\n(3.4)\n\nFor instance, the instanton gauge field AIsing\nin the singular gauge can be expressed\n\u03bc\nequivalently as\n+ \u2202\u03bc )\u03a9 \u2020sing ,\n(3.5)\n= \u03a9 sing (AIsing\nAIreg\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nin the regular gauge with the singular gauge function \u03a9 sing = (x4 + xi \u03c4i )/|x|. Certainly, the gauge invariant quantities, like the instanton action S I and topological\ncharge QI , are independent of this gauge choice in the absence of external fields.\nHowever, external fields cause the total action S tot to depend on the \"gauge-like\nchoice\" of the instanton part AI\u03bc , like Eq. (3.5), although S tot is, of course, indepenex\nI\ndent of the \"total\" gauge transformation of Atot\n\u03bc = A\u03bc + A\u03bc given by\n\u2032\n\ntot\n\u2020\nAtot\n\u03bc (x) = \u03a9(x)(A\u03bc (x) + \u2202\u03bc )\u03a9 (x).\n\n(3.6)\n\nWe call this partial gauge transformation of Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) a \"gauge-like\"\ntransformation. Such a \"gauge-like\" function should be determined iteratively by\nthe local minimization of the total action S tot .\n\u00a74.\n\nLattice formulation\n\nThe lattice technique is applicable to the local minimization of the total YangMills action for the gauge-like function \u03a9(x). Using the lattice, we can additionally\nemploy the maximally Abelian (MA) gauge fixing and extract monopole currents as\nwill be considered in \u00a76. The link variables both for the instanton and the external\nfield can be defined as\nU\u03bcI (s) \u2261 exp[iaAI\u03bc (s)],\nU\u03bcex (s) \u2261 exp[iaAex\n\u03bc (s)],\n\n(4.1)\n(4.2)\n\nrespectively. We use the standard Wilson action as the lattice Yang-Mills action,\nwhich can be rewritten as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n1\ntot\n(ij)\nSY M = 2\ntr 1 \u2212 P\u03bc\u03bd (s) + h.c.,\n(4.3)\n8\u03c0 s,|\u03bc|>|\u03bd|,(ij)\n\n\f6\n\nM.

With regard\nto the preservation of 4-dim geometrical symmetry, this clover-type action seems\npreferable. The labels i, j \u2208 {R, L} relate to the ordering ambiguity in the definition\nof the total link variables due to the lattice discretization. In fact, we have the two\nchoices\n(4.5)\n(4.6)\n\nU\u03bcR (s) \u2261 U\u03bcex (s)U\u03bcI (s),\n\nU\u03bcL (s) \u2261 U\u03bcI (s)U\u03bcex (s),\n\nI\nex\nwhich reproduce Atot\n\u03bc (x) = A\u03bc (x) + A\u03bc (x) in the continuum limit. We actually\ncombine U\u03bcR and U\u03bcL in such a manner to maintain the geometrical symmetry and\nthe ordering symmetry for the product of U\u03bcI and U\u03bcex , as shown in the Appendix.\nUnder the anisotropic scale transformation following Eq. (3.2), the instanton\nlink variables become\n\nU\u03bcI (\u03bb\u03b1 x\u03b1 ) \u2261 exp\n\n\u0010\n\ni\u03bb\u03bc aAI\u03bc (\u03bb\u03b1 x\u03b1 )\n\n\u0011\n\n(4.7)\n\n.\n\nHere, it is noted that the integral elements a are replaced with \u03bb\u03bc a.\nThe local gauge-like transformation of Eqs.

Under the local gauge-like transformation \u03a9(s0 ), the Wilson action density\nat s0 changes as SY M (s0 ) \u2192 SY\u2032 M (s0 ), with SY\u2032 M (s0 ) = SY M (s0 ) \u2212 \u03b4SY M (s0 ; \u03a9(s0 )).\nApart from an irrelevant constant, the difference of the total action density, \u03b4SY M ,\ncan be written in a bilinear form of \u03a9,\n\u03b4SY M (s0 ; \u03a9(s0 )) =\n\n12\nXX\n\n\u03bc>\u03bd \u03b1=1\n\ntr\n\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\nL\u0302\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd \u03a9 L\u0304\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd \u03a9 \u2020 (s0 ) ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere L\u0302\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd and L\u0304\u03b1\u03bc\u03bd are given by U I and U ex as shown in the Appendix. At the\nboundary of the N 4 lattice, we employ a trivial boundary as \u03a9 0 (s) = 1 and \u03a9 i (s) = 0.\nWe can determine the appropriate function \u03a9(s) by maximizing \u03b4S at each site, and\nwe obtain the instanton solution with minimal total action iteratively.\n\u00a75.\n\nNumerical results\n\nIn the actual calculation, we considered a typical size instanton with \u03c1 = 0.4 fm. 28)\nAlthough a single instanton possesses scale invariance in the continuum space, a\n\n\fInstanton and Monopole in External Chromomagnetic Fields\n\n7\n\nsmall-size instanton with \u03c1 < a cannot be described on a lattice because of the finite\nlattice spacing a. In order to guarantee lattice continuity for instanton configurations,\nwe used a lattice spacing a = 0.05 fm that is quite fine compared to the instanton\nsize \u03c1 = 0.4 fm on a N 4 = 324 lattice. From the instanton liquid model, 28) we have\n1\na\na\n4\nanother scale parameter, the gluon condensate, 32\u03c0\n2 hG\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd i \u2243 (200 MeV) . As a\ntypical magnitude of external fields, F\u03bc\u03bd is set to be on the order of the gluon condensate. Without loss of generality, we take F12 > 0 and set the other components\nequal to zero in a suitable Lorentz frame. This case corresponds to that of a constant\nmagnetic system.\nWe adopt the 't Hooft ansatz in the singular gauge as the initial instanton\nconfiguration superposed on the external field. Although we can also use the regular\ngauge for the instanton, the regular gauge function spreading over a wide region\nleads to a larger increase in the action due to the overlapping with the external field\nthan in the case of the singular gauge. This is the practical reason why we use the\nsingular gauge initially. Certainly, we would obtain the same result starting from\ndifferent gauge choices.\nFigure 1 shows the dependence of\nthe total action on the global color oriScross/SI\nentation of Eq. (3.1). Here, we plot con1.0\ntribution from the cross term between\nthe instanton and external field to the\n0.5\ntotal action, defined as\n0.0\n\nS cross/S I \u2261 (S tot \u2212 S I \u2212 S ex )/S I ,\n-0.5\n(5.1)\nwhich is normalized by the isolated in-1.0\nstanton action S I .

The dependence of the total action on\nvariable S cross differs from S tot only by\nthe global color-orientation angle \u03b8 in a hoI\nex\nmogeneous external field with F12 > 0.\na constant, since S and S are constants.\nThe total action is independent both of the angles \u03c8 and \u03c6 in Eq. (3.1), because\nof the O(2) symmetry along the direction of the external field. In sharp contrast,\nthe total action depends rather strongly on \u03b8, as shown in Fig. 1. We find the value\n\u03b8 = 0 that minimizes the total action for the global color orientation. In the absence\nof external fields, these parameters of the single instanton are collective coordinates,\nand cannot be determined uniquely.\nAfter determining the global angles, we carried out the anisotropic transformation of the instanton profile given by Eq. (4.7). It is instructive to consider\nthe case without an external field, in which the instanton is a classical solution\nof the Yang-Mills field equation. An arbitrary anisotropic scale transformation\nleads to an increase of the action, where the minimal action condition is trivial\nat \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = 1, as shown in Fig. 2(a). Thus, the single instanton is found\nto be stable with 4-dimensional spherical symmetry.\n\n\f8\n\nM. Fukushima, H. Suganuma and S.

(a) The isolated instanton case without\nan external field. (b) The interacting instanton case with an external field F12 > 0.\n\nThe external field leads to a deformation of the instanton profile. Here,\n2.0\nit is noted that the 4-dimensional ro1.8\ntational symmetry O(4) is reduced to\ntwo\n2-dimensional rotational symme1.6\ntries O(2) \u00d7 O(2), due to the homoge1.4\nneous external field F12 > 0.

We\ndeformed configuration in R3 . From\nplot the parameter \u03bb that provides the minthis result, we determine the parameimal Yang-Mills action as a function of the\n2\nters \u03bb\u03bc as \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bb = 1.3 and\ndimensionless variable \u03c1 F12 /4\u03c0.\n\u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = 1/\u03bb to realize the minimal\ntotal action with respect to the anisotropic transformation. Figure 3 shows that\nboth the instanton size and the strength of the external field affect the deformation\nof the instanton profile. The parameter (\u03bb \u2212 1) is approximately proportional to the\ndimensionless parameter \u03c12 F12 . It is found that the instanton would be deformed\nmore strongly by the background fields as the size increases.\nTo this point, we have determined the global color orientation and the anisotropic\nscale transformation as global conditions. In order to obtain a stable instanton solution in the external field, we further consider the gauge-like transformation of\nEqs. (3.3) and (3.4) as a local minimization of the total Yang-Mills action. We\nplot the cooling curve for the local gauge-like transformation in Fig. 4.

(2.3) in the singular gauge with the global parameter values \u03b8min = 0 and\n\u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = \u03bbmin = 1.3. With this iteration, the total action further decreases and\nconverges after about 100 sweeps. Consequently, we obtain the stable instanton solution with minimal total Yang-Mills action, which cannot be obtained by considering\nonly global parameters like O ab and \u03bb. Finally, we note that the instanton seems to\nbe a quadrupole-deformed configuration in R3 , as shown in Fig. 5.\nTo summarize this section, we considered the instanton deformation mechanism\nin a homogeneous external color field. In an external field with F12 > 0, the total\naction depends strongly on the angle \u03b8 of the global color orientation and the parameters \u03bb\u03bc of the anisotropic scale transformation. We obtained the minimal total\nYang-Mills action at \u03b8 = 0 and \u03bb1 = \u03bb2 = 1/\u03bb3 = 1/\u03bb4 > \u03bb = 1.3. The magnitude\nof the instanton deformation depends both on the instanton size and the strength of\nthe external field. A large instanton seems to be affected and deformed strongly by\nbackground fields. Finally, we obtained a stable instanton solution where the O(4)\nsymmetry is reduced to two 2-dimensional rotational symmetries O(2) \u00d7 O(2) in the\nxy and zt planes, due to the homogeneous external field with F12 = H3 > 0.

The appearance of magnetic monopoles corresponds to the\nNc \u22121 , which is different from that of\nhomotopy group \u03a02 (SU (Nc )/U (1)Nc \u22121 ) = Z\u221e\ninstantons. In the Abelian gauge, the color-magnetic monopole appears as a relevant\ndegree of freedom for the description of color confinement, which was proposed by\nNambu, 't Hooft and Mandelstam in the mid-1970s. 31) - 34) This mechanism can\nbe interpreted as the dual Meissner effect due to monopole condensation, which\nis a dual version of Cooper pair condensation in ordinary superconductivity. This\nanalogy is based on the duality between the magnetic and electric parts. In lattice\nQCD simulations, it has been observed that large monopole clustering covers the\nentire physical vacuum in the confinement phase in the MA gauge. This has been\ncited as evidence that monopole condensation is responsible for confinement. 35), 36)\nMany studies indicate that the monopole is a relevant degree of freedom for color\nconfinement and chiral symmetry breaking. 37) - 45)\nRecent studies show that monopoles are directly related to instantons, although\nthese topological objects belong to different homotopy groups. 21) - 26) This correlation suggests that instantons are important for the multi-production of monopole\nloops. 24), 25) For this reason, we investigate further the background-field effect on\nthe appearance of monopoles around instantons.\nThe monopole current is extracted as follows. We use the MA gauge, 35) which\nis defined in the SU (2) case by minimizing\nRch = 2\n\nX\u0014\ns,\u03bc\n\n1\n1 \u2212 {(U\u03bc1 (s))2 + (U\u03bc2 (s))2 } ,\n2\n\u0015\n\n(6.1)\n\nwith U\u03bc = U\u03bc0 +i\u03c4 i U\u03bci .

The current-conservation law \u2202\u03bc\u2032 k\u03bc (\u2217s) = 0 leads\nto a closed monopole loop in R4 . Here, \u2202\u03bc\u2032 denotes a backward derivative.\nHere, the self-dual solution automatically satisfies the MA gauge local condition\n(\u2202\u03bc \u2213 A3\u03bc )A\u00b1\n\u03bc = 0, which gives a stationary point of the functional Rch . For the\ncase of a single instanton on the lattice, the monopole loop is localized around the\ncenter of the instanton. However, such a monopole-loop plane cannot be determined,\nbecause there is no definite direction in either the single instanton configuration or\nin the MA gauge condition, due to 4-dim rotational invariance. In this respect, the\nexternal field plays an important role in the determination of the monopole trajectory\nformed by the instanton. Due to the homogeneous external field, the O(4) rotational\nsymmetry is reduced to O(2)\u00d7O(2), which specifies the 2-dim plane of the external\nfield, F12 6= 0. In fact, there appears an asymmetry between the xy plane and the\nzt plane for the F12 6= 0 case.\nWe now apply the MA gauge fixing to the superposed gauge field of the external\nfield and the stabilized instanton that was obtained in the previous section and\nextract monopole currents. Then, there appears a local correlation between the\ninstanton and monopole. In an external field with F12 > 0, a monopole loop appears\naround the instanton configuration in the zt plane, including its center, as shown in\nFig. 6. In other words, pair creation of a monopole and an anti-monopole occurs at a\ntime t along the external field H3 6= 0, and after some time interval pair annihilation\noccurs, which seems to partially screen the external magnetic field. Figure 7 displays\nthe dependence of the closed area of the monopole loop on the strength of the external\nfield.

Suganuma and S. Chiba\n\u00a77.\n\nSummary and conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated a deformation mechanism of the instanton\nconfiguration in the presence of a homogeneous external field. An isolated single\ninstanton has global color orientations O ab as collective coordinates and gauge degrees of freedom \u03a9(x). However, external fields lead to the dependence of the total\nYang-Mills action on these variables and the breaking of the O(4) symmetry of the\ninstanton solution. In this situation, the 't Hooft ansatz is not a solution of the\nYang-Mills field equation and is unstable in the variational space of the instanton\nconfiguration, whose degrees of freedom are the global color orientation Oab , the\nanisotropic scale \u03bb, and the local gauge-like function \u03a9(x). In this way, we have\nfound the stable instanton solution that minimizes the total Yang-Mills action starting from a total gauge field that is a superposition of the 't Hooft ansatz in the\nsingular gauge with an external field.\nWe have investigated the case of a homogeneous external field F12 > 0 for simplicity and determined Oab , \u03b8 and \u03a9(x) so as to minimize the total action. Due\nto the external field, the O(4) symmetry is reduced to two 2-dimensional rotational\nsymmetries O(2) \u00d7 O(2) in the xy and zt planes in the instanton solution. In the\nspace R3 at fixed t, we found a quadrupole deformation of this instanton solution.\n~ a prolate deformation occurs along the direction of H.\n~ The\nIn a magnetic field H,\nmagnitude of the deformation is found to increase with the instanton size and the\nstrength of background fields. Since the QCD vacuum is composed of many instantons and anti-instantons, instanton configurations seem to lose the O(4) symmetry\nand become deformed by such background fields.\nWe have considered further the effect of external fields on the local correlation\nbetween instantons and monopoles in the MA gauge. Both for the single instanton\nand MA gauge conditions, there is no definite direction in R4 , and therefore in\nthe absence of a background field, the direction of a monopole loop is \"fragile\". A\nhomogeneous external field breaks the 4-dimensional rotational invariance on the\ninstanton configuration, and as a result, a monopole trajectory around the instanton\nis formed with a direction corresponding to the external field. A monopole and antimonopole pair is created at a time t along the z direction of the external field H3 6= 0\nand after some time interval pair annihilation occurs in a zt plane. In fact, such a\nmonopole loop seems to partially screen the external field. The closed minimal area\nof the monopole-loop generated by a fixed size instanton is found to increase with\nthe strength of the external field.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Dr. H. Toki for his useful comments and discussions.

To maintain the ordering\nsymmetry for the product of U I and U ex , we have to consider both of the ordering\nchoices U R = U ex U I and U L = U I U ex , for each direction \u03bc and \u03bd. As shown\nin Fig. 8, we therefore consider four types of plaquettes (1),(2),(3) and (4), which\ncorrespond to (RR), (LL), (RL) and (LR), respectively. Here, we use the clover-type\nplaquettes because of the geometrical symmetry. The cross-checked plaquette in\neach clover is independent of the local gauge transformation of \u03a9(s0 ) and does not\ncontribute to \u03b4SY M (s0 ; \u03a9(s0 )).

Wilson plaquette around a site s0 . Here, we use the gauge transformation \u03a9(s0 ) of s0 .
