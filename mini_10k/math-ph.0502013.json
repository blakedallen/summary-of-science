Continuity of the \u25e6-product in the Tichonov topology is proved.\nConstruction of the \u2217-product of the Fedosov type in terms of theory of connection in a fibre bundle is explained.\n\nPACS numbers: 02.40.Hw, 03.65.Ca\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDeformation quantization was born twice. First complete version of quantum mechanics in the language of classical physics appeared in the middle of the previous century,\nwhen Moyal [1] using works by Weyl [2], Wigner [3] and Groenewold [4] presented\nquantum mechanics as a statistical theory. His results were only valid for the case of\nR2n .\nFor the second time deformation quantization appeared 30 years later. Since two\npapers by Bayen et al [5] were published in 1978, great interest in that version of\nquantum mechanics has been observed.\nOne of possible realisations of the deformation quantization programme is so called\nFedosov formalism [6], [7]. In its original version Fedosov approach to quantum mechanics, although based on theory of connection in a bundle, is a purely algebraic construction. A 1-form of connection or a 2-form of curvature appear as objects belonging\nto some algebra bundle and acting on elements from that bundle via commutators.\nPresence of connection and curvature in the Fedosov's formalism framework suggests that this topic may be treated in terms of differential geometry. As Fedosov\n1\n\n\fmachinery is a part of quantum theory, its geometrization is a geometrization of deformation quantization. Profits from such treatment of a physical theory are obvious:\none obtains clear definition of continuity, its is easy to represent derivation in a form\ncovariant under some transformations etc. etc. Since that we find worth reformulating\nthe Fedosov formalism in more geometrical language. The current paper is of our two\n(see [8]) devoted to this problem.\nMain role in Fedosov version of deformation quantization is played by a Weyl bundle\nwhich is an infinite dimensional differentiable manifold. Infinite dimensional differentiable manifolds have appeared in development of physics for several times. An example\nof such manifold is the Hilbert space of a quantum harmonic oscillator. But all of known\ninfinite dimensional differentiable manifolds are modelled on some Banach spaces\n([9]). And the Weyl bundle is not normalisable. To avoid this fundamental obstacle we\npropose a new look at an infinite dimensional manifold and explain its deep physical\norigin. Our considerations are related not only with deformation quantization. They\ncan be also useful in theory of self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations for the \u2217-bracket\nLie algebra (see [10], [11]).\nSince that in the second section we analyse a space of infinite real series R\u221e . We\nequip it in a metric and topological structure showing that it is a Hausdorff space and\nalso a Fr\u00e9chet space. After that we define an atlas on that space of infinite real series\nand explain how to extend it to a complete atlas so we prove that R\u221e is a differentiable\nmanifold. The space R\u221e appears as a dual space to the vector space of polynomials\nwith real coefficients.\nThe next part of our contribution is devoted to a Weyl algebra (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u25e6). We\nshow that this space is a metrizable complete space modelled on the differentiable\nmanifold R\u221e introduced in the second section. At the end of this part we prove that\nthe \u25e6-product is continuous in the Tichonov topology.\n\u2217\nThe fourth section deals with\nS the \u2217construction of a Weyl algebra bundle P M[[~]].\nWe show that the collection p\u2208M P Mp [[~]] of the Weyl algebras is really a differentiable manifold and, moreover, is a vector bundle.\n\nThe fifth part of our contribution is devoted to the construction of connection in the\nWeyl bundle. We start from a brief review of theory of connection in vector bundles\nand after that we introduce symplectic connection in P \u2217 M[[~]]. In the last part of this\npaper, using that symplectic connection, we propose abelian connection in Pp\u2217 M[[~]]\nand explain its role in deformation quantization. In contrary to Fedosov we introduce\nboth connections in terms of differential geometry and show that the algebraic method\nproposed by Fedosov is a special case (working only in Darboux atlases) of our more\ngeneral treatment. Moreover, we prove that the symplectic connection is the only\none induced connection on the Weyl bundle P \u2217 M[[~]] which can be expressed by the\n\u25e6-product.\n\nIn Appendix the proof of the relation between position of an element of the Weyl\nalgebra and its indices is presented.\n2\n\n\fAs this text is concentrated on the differential aspect of the Weyl bundle we do not\nconsider its algebraic properties. Formal construction of the Weyl bundle as a bundle\nof elementary C \u2217 algebras is contained in [12].\nOur paper was written by a physicist for physicists. This is the reason why we\ndecided to quote a lot of definitions and theorems which are well known to mathematicians. Another reason is that even such fundamental ideas like a differentiable manifold\nor curvature are defined in slightly different ways by different authors.\nBibiligraphy of the Fedosov formalism and its applications is rather wide. Since\nthat we mention only works the [13]\u2013[19] which represent the geometrical trend in this\nsubject.\nReader who finds the compendium of topology or differential geometry presented\nin our article unsatisfactory is pleased to look into [20]\u2013[24]. Parts devoted to theory\nof fibre bundles are based on [27] and [28].\nFinally a short comment about notation is needed. We use the Einstein summation\nconvention\nbut in all formulas in which we find it necessary we put also the symbol\nP\n. For example in the fifth section when in the same expression we have two or more\nsums in different intervals we use symbols of summation.\n\n2\n\nR\u221e as a differentiable manifold\n\nIn this section we introduce an infinite dimensional differentiable manifold which is the\nnatural generalisation of a space Rn , n \u2208 N . Such an object will be required to analyse\ndifferential properties of the Weyl bundle.\nLet us start from the 1-dimensional (1\u2013D) case. A pair (R, \u033a) is a metric space with\nthe distance defined as\ndef.\n\n\u033a(x, y) = |x \u2212 y|\n\nfor each x, y \u2208 R.\n\n(2.1)\n\nA set of balls\nK(c, r) = {x \u2208 R, |x \u2212 c| < r}, c \u2208 R, r > 0,\ndetermines the topology T on R so (R, T ) is a topological space.\nLet us construct a space R\u221e as the infinite Cartesian product \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ri , where\n\u221e\n\u221e\n\u2200i Ri = R. In the space R the topology \u03a0i=1 Ti is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2.1. [20] For each x = (x1 , x2 , . . .) \u2208 R\u221e the topological basis of neighbourhoods of the point x are all of sets U = \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Wi , where\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 R for each i apart from the finite number of indices,\nWi =\n\uf8f3\nUj (xj ) for the rest of indices.\n3\n\n\fBy Uj (xj ) we mean an arbitrary 1\u2013D neighbourhood of xj \u2208 R. The mapping\nP i : R\u221e \u2192 Ri\nsuch that Pi (x) = xi is called a projection of R\u221e on Ri . The topology \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ti is known\nas the Tichonov topology.\nThe Tichonov topology is the coarsest topology in which the projections Pi are\ncontinuous.\nThe Tichonov topology can be also introduced by a set of seminorms. The advantage of this method is that R\u221e becomes in a natural way a Fr\u00e9chet space so to investigate its properties we are able to use the powerful machinery of theory of Fr\u00e9chet\nspaces.\nDefinition 2.2. [22] Let V be a vector space over R. A mapping [| * |] : V \u2192 R is called\na seminorm if:\n1. \u2200x\u2208V [|x|] \u2265 0;\n2. \u2200x\u2208V \u2200t\u2208R [|t * x|] = |t| * [|x|];\n3. \u2200x,y\u2208V [|x + y|] \u2264 [|x|] + [|y|].\nAn open ball in a seminorm [| * |] is a set of points such that\nK(c, r) = {x \u2208 V, [|x \u2212 c|] < r}, c \u2208 V, r > 0.\n\n(2.2)\n\nLet [| * |]i be a seminorm in a vector space R\u221e defined by\ndef.\n\n[| * |]i : R\u221e \u2192 Ri , [|x|]i = |xi |.\n\n(2.3)\n\nA set of seminorms {[| * |]i }i\u2208N in R\u221e determines a topology on R\u221e in the following\nway.\nA set U \u2208 R\u221e is open in the topology compatible with seminorms {[| * |]i }i\u2208N if for\nevery x \u2208 U there exist i1 , . . . , ir \u2208 N and \u01eb > 0 such that\nKi1 (x, \u01eb) \u2229 Ki2 (x, \u01eb) \u2229 . . . \u2229 Kir (x, \u01eb) \u2282 U\ni.e. each point of U belongs to an intersection of finite number of balls contained in U.\nBy Kil (x, \u01eb) we denote an open ball (2.2) in the seminorm [| * |]il .\nTopology determined by the set of seminorms {[|*|]i }i\u2208N is the same as the Tichonov\ntopology in R\u221e introduced before ( see [20]).\nTheorem 2.1. [22] A vector space V with topology T defined by the set of seminorms\n{[| * |]z }z\u2208J (J is countable or not) is topological vector space (V, T ). It is also a Hausdorff space iff the neutral element \u0398 \u2208 V is the only one vector such that \u2200z\u2208J [|\u0398|]z = 0.\n4\n\n\fUsing the above theorem we conclude that the pair (R\u221e , \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ti ) is a Hausdorff\nspace.\nDefinition 2.3. [22] A Hausdorff topological vector space (V, T ) is called pre-Fr\u00e9chet\nif its topology is given by a countable set of seminorms.\nWe see that the space (R\u221e , \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ti ) is a pre-Fr\u00e9chet vector space. All of pre-Fr\u00e9chet\nspaces are metrizable. The distance in (R\u221e , \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ti ) is defined as\ndef.\n\n\u033a(x, y) =\n\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n1 [|x \u2212 y|]i\n1 |xi \u2212 y i |\n=\n.\ni 1 + [|x \u2212 y|]\ni 1 + |xi \u2212 y i |\n2\n2\ni\ni=1\ni=1\n\n(2.4)\n\nThe metric (2.4) constitutes the same topology as the set of seminorms (2.3).\nThere is no norm establishing the metric (2.4). This conclusion is the straightforward consequence of the fact that the maximal distance \u033a(x, y) in the metric (2.4)\nequals 1.\nDefinition 2.4. [22] A complete pre-Fr\u00e9chet space is called a Fr\u00e9chet space .\nA theorem holds\nTheorem 2.2. [20] Let (Vi , \u033ai ), i = 1, 2, . . . are metric spaces and let v = (v1 , v2 , . . .),\nu = (u1 , u2 , . . .) \u2208 \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Vi and\n\u221e\nX\n1 \u033ai (vi , ui )\n\u033a(v, u) =\n.\n2i 1 + \u033ai (vi , ui )\ni=1\ndef.\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe metric space (\u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Vi , \u033a) is complete iff all of spaces (Vi , \u033ai ), i = 1, 2, . . . are complete.\nThe straightforward consequence of that theorem is the following one.\nTheorem 2.3. The pre-Fr\u00e9chet space (R\u221e , \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ti ) is a Fr\u00e9chet space.\n\nLet us recall the definition of a differentiable manifold [20].\nDefinition 2.5. A differentiable n- dimensional manifold M of class C r is a pair\n(M, A), where M is a Hausdorff space and A = {(Uz , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J is a set of charts (Uz , \u03c6z )\nand\n1. (Uz , \u03c6z )z\u2208J is an open covering of M and \u03c6z : Uz \u2192 Oz \u2282 Rn are homeomorphisms\n\n5\n\n\f2. mappings\ndef.\n\n\u03c6zv = \u03c6z \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nv : \u03c6v (Uz \u2229 Uv ) \u2192 \u03c6z (Uz \u2229 Uv )\n\n(2.6)\n\nare r-times continuously differentiable and they are called transition functions.\nBy Oz we denote open subsets of Rn .\n\u221e\nHenceforth to shorten notation instead of writing (R\u221e , \u03a0\u221e\ni=1 Ti ) we will put R .\n\nThe main problem in a proof that the space R\u221e is some differentiable manifold is\nthe fact that R\u221e is not a Banach space. To show that despite this obstacle R\u221e may\nbe treated as a differentiable manifold we propose the following consideration.\n1. Each element of the vector space R\u221e can be represented uniquely as an infinite\nseries of real numbers (x1 , x2 , . . .). This suggests that there exist atlases on R\u221e\ncontaining only one chart (R\u221e , \u03c6) in which numbers xi , i = 1, 2, . . . are coordinates of an arbitrary fixed point on R\u221e .\n2. From physical reasons which will be explained in the next section, it is sufficient\nto restrict our considerations to the atlas A = {(R\u221e , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J on R\u221e such that\neach chart (R\u221e , \u03c6z ) \u2208 A covers the whole space R\u221e and moreover all mappings\n\u221e\n\u03c6zv = \u03c6z \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n\u2192 R\u221e\nv : R\n\nare linear bijections. The set of indices J can be finite, countable or uncountable. Each of bijections \u03c6zv (x1 , . . . , xi , . . .) = (y 1 , . . . , y i , . . .) may be written in a\nfollowing form:\ny 1 = a11 x1 + a12 x2 + . . .\n..\n..\n.\n.\n(2.7)\ni\n1\ny = ai1 x + ai2 x2 + . . .\n..\n..\n.\n.\nwhere \u2200i,j\u2208N aij \u2208 R. To ensure convergence of sums standing at the right side\nof the infinite system of equations (2.7) we require that for each index 'i' only\nfinite number of coefficients aij is different from 0. This condition holds for every\nmapping \u03c6zv so especially it is true also for the transformation\n(y 1 , . . . , y i , . . .) \u2212\u2192 (x1 , . . . , xi , . . .) inverse to (2.7).\n3. Although the general definition of the derivative of the mapping \u03c6zv does not\nexist because of lack of a norm in R\u221e we can precisely define partial derivatives\n\u2202y i def.\ny i (x1 , . . . , xj + d, . . .) \u2212 y i (x1 , . . . , xj , . . .) (2.7)\n=\nlim\n= aij .\nd\u21920\n\u2202xj\nd\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn this infinite dimensional case we assume that the existence of all partial deriva\u2202y i\n\u2202xj\ntives \u2202x\nj and \u2202y i (the proof for the inverse mapping is analogous) of an arbitrary\nrange is sufficient to treat the mapping \u03c6zv to be C \u221e - differentiable.\n6\n\n\f4. A set of linear finite transformations of the form (2.7) constitutes a pseudogroup\nof transformations \u0393 (see [24]). The atlas A = {(R\u221e , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J is compatible with\nthe pseudogroup \u0393. Since each atlas compatible with some subgroup is contained\nin a unique complete atlas of a manifold, starting from the atlas {(R\u221e , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J\nand the psedogroup \u0393 we point out the complete atlas on R\u221e .\nFrom the construction presented in this section we conclude that R\u221e is really differentiable manifold of a class C \u221e .\n\n3\n\nThe Weyl algebra\n\nIn this section we define and analyse some properties of a Weyl algebra. Method\npresented here is based on physical interpretation of this algebra. It is purely geometric\non the contrary to algebraic way proposed by Fedosov [6], [7]. We construct the Weyl\nalgebra by a symmetric tensor product of spaces cotangent to some manifold.\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a 2n\u2212D symplectic manifold, Tp\u2217 M the cotangent space to M at a\npoint p of M and A = {(Uz , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J an atlas on M.\nDefinition 3.1. The space (Tp\u2217 M)l , l \u2265 1 is a symmetrized tensor product of\nTp\u2217 M \u2299 . . . \u2299 Tp\u2217 M . It is spanned by\n|\n{z\n}\nl\u2212times\n\ndef.\n\nvK1 \u2299 * * * \u2299 vKl =\n\nX\n1\nv\u03c3K1 \u2297 * * * \u2297 v\u03c3Kl ,\nl! all permutations\n\n(3.9)\n\ndef.\n\nwhere vK1 , . . . , vKl \u2208 Tp\u2217 M. For l = 0 we put (Tp\u2217 M)0 = R.\nEach element v \u2208 (Tp\u2217 M)l in a chart (Uz , \u03c6z ) \u220b p is uniquely represented by a\nsequence\nv = (v1...1 , . . . , vi1 ...il , . . . , v2n...2n ).\n(3.10)\nFor indices the relation holds i1 \u2264 i2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 il\u22121 \u2264 il . The number of elements of the\nsequence (3.10) is equal to (2n+l\u22121)!\n. This is the straightforward consequence of the fact\n(2n\u22121)! l!\nthat\nm\nm\nm\nX\nX\nX\n(m + l \u2212 1)!\n1=\n.\n(3.11)\n...\nl!(m \u2212 1)!\nkl =kl\u22121\nk1 =1 k2 =k1\n{z\n}\n|\nl\u2212 times\n\nIntroducing the distance \u033al (v, u) between two elements of (Tp\u2217 M)l as\n(\n|v \u2212 u|\nfor l = 0,\ndef.\n\u033al (v, u) =\nP\nfor l > 0,\nall i1 \u2264i2 \u2264...\u2264il\u22121 \u2264il |vi1 i2 ...il\u22121 il \u2212 ui1 i2 ...il\u22121 il |\n7\n\n(3.12)\n\n\fwe define a metric structure in (Tp\u2217 M)l . The distance between v and u depends on the\nchoice of the system of coordinates on the manifold M.\nA set of balls\nKl (v, r) = {u \u2208 (Tp\u2217 M)l , \u033al (v, u) < r}, v \u2208 (Tp\u2217 M)l , r > 0\n\n(3.13)\n\nintroduces a topology Tl on (Tp\u2217 M)l so ((Tp\u2217 M)l , Tl ) is a topological space. Although\nthe distance \u033al (v, u) depends on the choice of a chart on the manifold M, the topology\nTl is independent of it. This conclusion becomes obvious if we notice that the topology\ndefined by open balls (3.13) is the same as topology established by cubes\n|v1...1 \u2212 u1...1 | \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 |v2n...2n \u2212 u 2n...2n |.\nMoreover ((Tp\u2217 M)l , Tl ) is complete vector space. It is also a differentiable manifold\n(2n+l\u22121)!\n\nmodelled on a Banach space (R (2n\u22121)! l! , || * ||) with a norm\n(2n+l\u22121)!\n(2n\u22121)! l!\n\ndef.\n\n||x|| =\n\nX\n\n|xi |.\n\ni=1\n\nDefinition 3.2. A preWeyl vector space Pp\u2217 M at a point p \u2208 M is the direct sum\ndef.\n\nPp\u2217 M =\n\n\u221e\nM\nl=0\n\n\u0001\n(Tp\u2217 M)l \u2295 (Tp\u2217 M)l .\n\nL\nBeside \u221e\nl=0 also another direct sum appears because components of tensors which\nare used in physics are in general complex numbers. The preWeyl vector space is a\ntopological space with the Tichonov topology. Construction of a metric and topology\nis analogous to that one presented in the previous section.\n\u0013\n\u221e \u0012\nX\n1\n1\n\u033al (Re(v), Re(u))\n\u033al (Im(v), Im(u))\ndef.\n(3.14)\n+\n\u033a(v, u) =\n2l+2 1 + \u033al (Re(v), Re(u)) 2l+2 1 + \u033al (Im(v), Im(u))\nl=0\nfor each v, u \u2208 Pp\u2217 M. The distances \u033al (Re(v), Re(u)) and \u033al (Im(v), Im(u)) are computed between real and imaginary parts of components of v, u belonging to\n(Tp\u2217 M)l \u2295 (Tp\u2217 M)l . Again, although the metric (3.14) depends on the choice of a chart\non M, the Tichonov topology on Pp\u2217 M is independent of it.\nDue to the theorem 2.2 the preWeyl space is also a Fr\u00e9chet space.\nDefinition 3.3. [14] Let \u03bb be a fixed real number and V some vector space. A formal\nseries in the formal parameter \u03bb is every expression of the form\nv[[\u03bb]] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bbK vK , where \u2200K vK \u2208 V.\n\nK=0\n\nThe set of formal series v[[\u03bb]] constitutes a vector space.\n8\n\n(3.15)\n\n\fAddition means vector summation of elements of the same power of \u03bb and multiplication by a scalar a \u2208 C is multiplication of each vector standing on the right side\nof (3.15) by a i.e.\n\u221e\nX\nu[[\u03bb]] + v[[\u03bb]] =\n\u03bbK (uK + vK )\n(3.16)\nK=0\n\nand\n\na * v[[\u03bb]] =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bbK (avK ).\n\n(3.17)\n\nK=0\n\nA vector space of formal series over the vector space V in the formal parameter \u03bb\nwe will denote by V [[\u03bb]]. The space V [[\u03bb]] may be treated as a direct sum\nV [[\u03bb]] =\n\n\u221e\nM\n\nVi ,\n\nVi = V\n\nfor every i.\n\n(3.18)\n\ni=0\n\nWe introduce the formal series over the preWeyl vector space as follows.\nDefinition 3.4. A Weyl vector space Pp\u2217M[[~]] is the vector space over the preWeyl\nvector space Pp\u2217 M in the formal parameter ~.\nFor physical applications we usually identify the parameter ~ with the Planck\nconstant. Terms standing at the k-th power of ~k and belonging to the direct sum\n(Tp\u2217 M)l \u2295 (Tp\u2217 M)l we will denote by v[k, l]. Now each element of Pp\u2217 M[[~]] may be\nwritten in the form\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\nv=\n~k v[k, l].\n(3.19)\nk=0 l=0\n\nP\u221e\n\nFor l = 0 we put k=0 ~k v[k, 0], v[k, 0] \u2208 C. Again using the Tichonov procedure we\nequip the Weyl space with a topological structure. The Weyl space is a Fr\u00e9chet space\n(see theorem 2.2) with the metric\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u033ak (u, v)\n\u033a(u, v) =\n,\nk+1\n2\n1\n+\n\u033a\nk (u, v)\nk=0\ndef.\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere by \u033ak (u, v) we understand the distance (3.14) computed between parts of u and\nv standing at ~k .\nDefinition 3.5. [7] The degree deg(v[k, l]) of the component v[k, l]of the Weyl vector\nspace Pp\u2217 M[[~]] is the sum 2k + l.\nAt the beginning of this paragraph we propose following convention - coordinates\nof a vector v[k, l] we will denote by v[k, l]i1 ...il . To show that Pp\u2217 M[[~]] is a differentiable\n\n9\n\n\fmanifold first we introduce one chart (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u03c6) covering the whole space. The\nmapping \u03c6 is defined as follows:\n\u03c6(v) = (Re(v[0, 0]), Im(v[0, 0]), Re(v[0, 1]1), Im(v[0, 1]1), . . .)\n\n(3.21)\n\nLet (\u03c6(v))d denotes the d\u2212th element of the sequence (3.21). Elements in this sequence\nare ordered according to the following rules:\n1. deg(\u03c6(v))d1 > deg(\u03c6(v))d2 =\u21d2 d1 > d2 .\n2. For the same degree if the power of ~ in (\u03c6(v))d1 is higher than in (\u03c6(v))d2 then\nd1 > d2 .\n3. For the same degree and power of ~ we order elements like in (3.10) taking into\naccount indices of a tensor .\n4. For two terms of the same degree, the same power of ~ and the same tensor\nindices the real part precedes the imaginary one.\nA formula connecting the position of v[k, l]i1 ...il in the sequence (3.21) with indices\nk, i1 . . . il is rather complicated. Reader may find it in the Appendix.\nThe chart (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u03c6) is determined by the choice of a chart on the symplectic\nmanifold M because numbers (\u03c6(v))d are components of tensors in a natural basis given\nby coordinates on M. Let us cover the Weyl space with an atlas A = {(Uz , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J\nconsisting of all natural charts. Each of mappings \u03c6z satisfies the ordering rule (3.21)\nand covers the whole Weyl space.\n1. \u2200z\u2208J \u03c6z are homeomorphisms (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u03c6) \u2192 R\u221e .\n2. mappings \u03c6zv = \u03c6z \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\n: R\u221e \u2192 R\u221e are linear bijections of the kind (2.7).\nv\nMoreover, each arbitrary fixed element (\u03c6z (v))i depends linearly only on terms\n(\u03c6v (v))j characterized by the same power of ~, the same tensor range and belonging to the same real or imaginary part of v. Thus we conclude that all partial\n\u2202(\u03c6 (v))\nderivatives \u2202(\u03c6zv (v))ji exist. Moreover, for a fixed j only finite number of those\npartial derivatives do not vanish.\nTaking into account facts presented above we say that the Weyl space Pp\u2217 M[[~]] is a\ndifferentiable manifold.\nFor physical reasons (see [7]) the Weyl space may be equipped with a structure of\nan algebra. Let Xp \u2208 Tp M be some fixed vector from the space Tp M tangent to M at\na point p. Components of Xp in the natural basis { \u2202q\u2202 1 , . . . , \u2202q\u22022n } we denote by Xpi . It\nis clear that for every v[k, l] \u2208 Pp\u2217 M[[~]] the acting\nv[k, l](Xp , . . . , Xp ) = v[k, l]i1 ...il Xpi1 * * * Xpil\n| {z }\nl\u2212times\n\n10\n\n\fis a complex number and we can treat v[k, l](Xp , . . . , Xp ) as a polynomial of the l\u2212th\n| {z }\nl\u2212times\n\ndegree in components of the vector Xp .\n\nThus elements of the Weyl space Pp\u2217 M[[~]] are mappings\nv(Xp ) : R2n \u2192 C[[~]],\ndef.\n\nv(Xp ) =\n\n\u221e X\n\u221e\nX\n\n~k v[k, l]i1 ...il Xpi1 * * * Xpil .\n\n(3.22)\n\nk=0 l=0\n\nA symbol C[[~]] denotes a space of formal series over C.\nLet us go to the definition of \u25e6-product in the Weyl space. By a derivative\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202Xpi\n\nwe\n\nunderstand formal sum (ordered by powers of ~k ) of partial derivatives of polynomials\n\u2202\nv[k, l]i1 ...il Xpi1 * * * Xpil . Derivation \u2202X\ni does not influence on powers of ~. The definition\np\nof derivation presented here is formal because in the space C[[~]] a norm is not defined.\nDefinition 3.6. [7] The product \u25e6 : Pp\u2217M[[~]] \u00d7 Pp\u2217 M[[~]] \u2192 Pp\u2217 M[[~]] of two elements\nv, u \u2208 Pp\u2217 M[[~]] is such element w \u2208 Pp\u2217 M[[~]] that for each Xp \u2208 Tp M the equality\nholds\nw(Xp ) = v(Xp ) \u25e6 u(Xp ) =\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221e\nt\nX\n\u2202 t u(Xp )\n\u2202 t v(Xp )\n1 i~\ndef.\ni1 j 1\nit j t\n=\n\u03c9 ***\u03c9\n.\n(3.23)\nt! 2\n\u2202Xpi1 . . . \u2202Xpit \u2202Xpj1 . . . \u2202Xpjt\nt=0\nThe pair (Pp\u2217M[[~]], \u25e6) is a noncommutative associative algebra called the Weyl\nalgebra. By \u03c9 ij we understand components of the tensor inverse to the symplectic\nform in a point p i.e. the relation holds\n\u03c9 ij \u03c9jk = \u03b4ki .\nHere we mention some properties of the \u25e6-product in (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u25e6). More information can be found in [7], [8], [25]. It is worth emphasizing that the first of presented\nproperties becomes clear thanks to our geometrical approach to the Weyl algebra.\n1. The \u25e6-product is independent of the chart.\n2. The \u25e6-multiplication is associative but nonabelian.\n3. \u2200v,u \u2208 (Pp\u2217 M [[~]],\u25e6) the relation holds\n\ndeg(v \u25e6 u) = deg(v) + deg(u).\n\nLet us show continuity of the \u25e6-product in the Tichonov topology in (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u25e6).\nAnalogously to the formula (2.3) in an arbitrary fixed chart (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u03c6) we introduce\nseminorms as\ndef.\n(3.24)\n\u2200v\u2208(Pp\u2217 M [[~]],\u25e6) \u2200i\u2208N [|v|]i = |(\u03c6(v))i |.\n11\n\n\fThe metric (3.20) is now expressed by seminorms {[|*|]i}i\u2208N as (compare with (2.4))\n\u221e\nX\n1 [|v \u2212 u|]i\n\u033a(v, u) =\n.\n2i 1 + [|v \u2212 u|]i\ni=1\n\n(3.25)\n\nLet us consider two sequences {vK }K\u2208N , {uJ }J\u2208N elements vK , uJ \u2208 (Pp\u2217M[[~]], \u25e6) such\nthat\nlim vK = lim uJ = \u0398.\n(3.26)\nK\u2192\u221e\n\nJ\u2192\u221e\n\nThis relation implies that for every i \u2208 N\nlim [|vK |]i = lim [|uJ |]i = 0.\n\nK\u2192\u221e\n\nJ\u2192\u221e\n\n(3.27)\n\nThe \u25e6-product is continuous if for every two sequences {vK }K\u2208N , {uJ }J\u2208N fulfilling the\ncondition (3.26) and for every two a, b \u2208 (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u25e6) the equality holds\nlim ((a + vK ) \u25e6 (b + uJ )) = a \u25e6 b.\n\nJ,K\u2192\u221e\n\n(3.28)\n\nFormula (3.28) is equivalent to the system of equations\nlimK\u2192\u221e vK \u25e6 b = \u0398,\nlimJ\u2192\u221e a \u25e6 uJ = \u0398,\nlimJ,K\u2192\u221e vK \u25e6 uJ = \u0398.\n\n(3.29)\n(3.30)\n(3.31)\n\nLet us consider an element (vK \u25e6b)[r, l]i1 ...il . Its degree equals 2r +l. From the definition\nof the \u25e6-product (3.23) and its 3rd property (look at page 11) we see that (vK \u25e6b)[r, l]i1 ...il\nis a finite linear combination of components of vectors vK such that deg vK \u2264 2r + l.\nSince that for J \u2192 \u221e the equality (3.29) holds. Using the same method we prove\nrelations (3.30) and (3.31).\n\n4\n\nThe Weyl bundle\n\nUntil now we have worked with the Weyl algebra (P \u2217 Mp [[~]], \u25e6) at an arbitrary fixed\npoint p belonging to the symplectic manifold M. Now we are going to analyse a\ncollection of Weyl algebras taken for all points of M.\nDefinition 4.1. A Weyl bundle is a triplet (P \u2217 M[[~]], \u03c0, M), where\n[\ndef.\nP \u2217 M[[~]] =\nP \u2217 Mp [[~]]\np\u2208M\n\nis a differentiable manifold called a total space, M is a base space and\n\u03c0 : P \u2217 M[[~]] \u2192 M a projection.\n12\n\n(4.32)\n\n\fElements of the Weyl bundle P \u2217 M[[~]] can be thought of as the pairs (p, v), where\nv \u2208 (P \u2217 Mp [[~]], \u25e6). The projection \u03c0 assigns a point p to the pair (p, v).\nThe Weyl algebra (Pp\u2217 M[[~]], \u25e6) considered in the previous section is related to the\npoint p \u2208 M. To define a fibre in the Weyl bundle P \u2217 M[[~]] it is required to introduce\nthe \u25e6-product in the topological vector space R\u221e . However, the explicit form of a\nproduct u \u25e6 v, where u, v \u2208 R\u221e are of the form (3.21), is complicated and useless for\npractical purposes. But in fact it is sufficient to be aware that the algebra (R\u221e , \u25e6)\nexists.\nThe definition 4.1 contains a statement that the Weyl bundle P \u2217 M[[~]] is a C \u221e\ndifferentiable manifold. To prove this fact we define a topology on P \u2217 M[[~]] first.\nLet A = {(Uz , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J be an atlas on the M. By the definition\ndef.\n\nP\u2032 =\n\n[\n\n(Uz \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 {z}) \u2282 M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J.\n\nz\u2208J\n\nThe set J is equipped with the discrete topology. The topology in M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J is\nconstructed according to the\nso the Cartesian product M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J has a\nS definition 2.1\n\u221e\nTichonov topology. Since z\u2208J (Uz \u00d7 R \u00d7 {z}) is a subset of M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J, we equip\nit with the induced topology.\nNow in P \u2032 we establish the equivalence relation\n\n(p, v, z) \u223c (p\u2032 , v \u2032 , d) iff\n\n(4.33)\n\n1. p = p\u2032 ,\n2. v \u2032 is the image of v in the mapping induced by the change of coordinates\n(Uz , \u03c6z ) \u2192 (Ud , \u03c6d ) on M. It is important to remember that the tensor \u03c9 ij also\ntransforms under that change of coordinates.\ndef.\n\nP \u2217 M[[~]] = P \u2032 / \u223c posesses the quotient topology so the Weyl bundle is a topological\nspace.\nLet us consider two projections:\n1. a canonical projection G : P \u2032 \u2192 P \u2032 / \u223c defined as\n\u2200(p,v,z)\u2208P \u2032 G((p, v, z)) = [(p, v, z)].\n\n(4.34)\n\nSince the topology on P \u2217 M[[~]] is the quotient one, the canonical projection G\nand its inverse G\u22121 are continuous mappings [21]. A symbol [ * ] denotes the\nequivalence class;\n\n13\n\n\f2. a projection L : P \u2032 \u2192 M fulfilling the equation\n\u2200(p,v,z)\u2208P \u2032 L((p, v, z)) = p.\n\n(4.35)\n\nIn the topology of a Cartesian product on M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J a projection\nP r : M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J \u2192 M defined as\n\u2200(p,v,z)\u2208M\u00d7R\u221e \u00d7J P r((p, v, z)) = p\nis continuous from the definition of the Tichonov topology. The projection L is\nnothing but P r|P \u2032 and the topology on P \u2032 has been induced from M \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 J\nso the mapping L is continuous.\nProjections G and L preserve the point p so we can draw a commutative diagram\nL\n\nP\u2032\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2745G\n\u2745\n\u2745\n\u2758\n\u2745\n\n\u2732\n\nM\n\n\u2712\n\u03c0\n\nP \u2217 M[[~]]\ndef.\n\nThe mapping \u03c0 = L \u25e6 G\u22121 as a product of two continuous mappings is also continuous. The equality holds\nG(Uz \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 {z}) = \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ).\n\n(4.36)\n\nRelation (4.36) constitutes a bijection between Uz \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 {z} and \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ). Moreover\nG and G\u22121 are continuous mappings so we conclude that\nG|Uz \u00d7R\u221e \u00d7{z} : Uz \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 {z} \u2192 \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz )\n\n(4.37)\n\nis a homeomorphism.\nNext step is to prove that P \u2217 M[[~]] is a Hausdorff space. Let q1 , q2 \u2208 P \u2217 M[[~]]\nand \u03c0(q1 ) 6= \u03c0(q2 ). The manifold M is a Hausdorff space so we can always choose two\nneighbourhoods V1 , V2 such that \u03c0(q1 ) \u2208 V1 , \u03c0(q2 ) \u2208 V2 and V1 \u2229 V2 = \u2205.\nLet us introduce the identification Id : Uz \u00d7 R\u221e \u00d7 {z} \u223c\n= Uz \u00d7 R\u221e . Superposition\nof two mappings\nId \u25e6 (G|Uz \u00d7R\u221e \u00d7{z} )\u22121 : \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ) \u2192 Uz \u00d7 R\u221e\n(4.38)\nis a homeomorphism so \u03c0 \u22121 (V1 ) and \u03c0 \u22121 (V2 ) are neighbourhoods of q1 , q2 respectively\nand, moreover \u03c0 \u22121 (V1 ) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (V2 ) = \u2205.\nIn case q1 , q2 \u2208 P \u2217 M[[~]], q1 6= q2 and \u03c0(q1 ) = \u03c0(q2 ) we have q1 , q2 \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ) for\nsome z \u2208 J. But from the fact that (4.38) is homeomorphism we conclude that \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz )\nis a Hausdorff space so there exist separate neighbourhoods of q1 and q2 .\n14\n\n\fSo it has been proved that the Weyl bundle is a Hausdorff space.\nThe Cartesian product of the open subset Uz and the fibre R\u221e is homeomorphic to\nOz \u00d7 R\u221e , where Oz is an open subset of R2n . We denote that homeomorphism by\n\u03c2z : Uz \u00d7 R\u221e \u2192 Oz \u00d7 R\u221e . The mapping \u03c2z is determined by a chart (Uz , \u03c6z ). Namely\n\u03c2z (p, v) = (\u03c6z (p), T\u03c6z (v)).\n\n(4.39)\n\nThe symbol T\u03c6z denotes taking natural components of v. Remember that also the tensor\n\u03c9 ij from the definition (3.23) transforms under \u03c2z . The homeomorphism\n\u03c6z : \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ) \u2192 Oz \u00d7 R\u221e ,\ndef.\n\n\u03c6z = \u03c2z \u25e6 Id \u25e6 G\u22121\n\n(4.40)\n\nestablishes a differential structure on the Weyl bundle P \u2217 M[[~]]. Indeed an atlas on\nP \u2217 M[[~]] is the set of charts {(\u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ), \u03c6z )}z\u2208J . Mappings \u03c6z \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121\nare transition\nv\nfunctions and they are C \u221e -differentiable in a sense that all of their partial derivatives\nexist.\nThus we conclude that P \u2217 M[[~]] is a C \u221e -class infinite dimensional differentiable\nmanifold.\nThe Weyl bundle is an example of a vector bundle. Apart from elements described\nabove the definition of a vector bundle (for details see [23]) it constists of a structure\ngroup G being a Lie group and local trivialisations.\nIf be GL(2n, R) we denote the group of real automorphisms of the cotangent space\nthe structure group of the fibre is\n\nTp\u2217 M,\n\ndef.\n\nG =\n\n[ z2 ]\n\u221e M\nM\nz=0 k=0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8edGL(2n, R) \u2297 . . . \u2297 GL(2n, R) \u2295 GL(2n, R) \u2297 . . . \u2297 GL(2n, R)\uf8f8 .\n|\n{z\n} |\n{z\n}\n(z\u22122k)\u2212times\n\n(z\u22122k)\u2212times\n\n(4.41)\n\nMoreover, when the element vi1 i2 transforms under the element\ng \u2208 GL(2n, R) \u2297 GL(2n, R) then \u03c9 ij transforms under g \u22121 \u2208 GL(2n, R) \u2297 GL(2n, R).\nMappings Id \u25e6 (G|Uz \u00d7R\u221e \u00d7{z} )\u22121 (see (4.37)) are local trivialisations of the Weyl\nbundle because they map \u03c0 \u22121 (Uz ) onto the direct product Uz \u00d7 R\u221e .\nSince the fibre R\u221e is not only a vector space but also an algebra, the Weyl bundle\nis an example of the algebra bundle.\nKnowing that the Weyl bundle is a differentiable manifold we can easily define\nsmooth sections of it or introduce a paralell transport on P \u2217 M[[~]]. Physical application of those quantities will be explained in the last part of our contribution.\n\n15\n\n\f5\n\nConnections in the Weyl bundle\n\nNow we are ready to present the construction of a connection in the Weyl bundle. This\nconstruction plays crucial role in physical applications of mathematics contained in our\ncontribution. As before we begin with some general definitions and later apply them\nto the Weyl algebra bundle.\nDefinition 5.2. [27] Suppose (E, \u03c0, M) is a vector bundle over a manifold M and\nC \u221e (E) is a set of smooth sections of E over M. An exterior covariant derivative\non the bundle (E, \u03c0, M) is a map\n\u2202 \u0303 : C \u221e (E) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (T \u2217 M \u2297 E),\nwhich satisfies the following conditions:\n1. for any u, v \u2208 C \u221e (E)\n\n \u0303 + v) = \u2202(u)\n \u0303\n \u0303\n\u2202(u\n+ \u2202(v),\n\n(5.42)\n\n2. for any v \u2208 C \u221e (E) and any f \u2208 C \u221e (M)\n \u0303 v) = df \u2297 v + f * \u2202v.\n \u0303\n\u2202(f\n\n(5.43)\n\nRemarks\n1. The map \u2202 \u0303 is also called connection (see [6], [7], [27], [28]). We keep convention\nused in our earlier papers and by 'connection' understand only a form determining\nexterior covariant derivative of a local frame field (see formula (5.51)).\n2. By T \u2217 M the cotangent bundle over the manifold M is denoted.\nLet us introduce a new symbol. \u039bp (M) is a bundle of p-forms over M. Smooth\nsections of the tensor product E \u2297 \u039bp (M) are known as p-forms on M of values in\nE or E-valued p-forms. Since C \u221e (E \u2297 \u039bp (M)) is a module over C \u221e (M), there is a\nmodule isomorphism ([28])\nC \u221e (E) \u2297 C \u221e (\u039bp (M)) \u2212\u2192 C \u221e (E \u2297 \u039bp (M))\n\n(5.44)\n\nwhich we shall denote by v \u2297 f \u2192 f * v or simply f v.

Both of\nthose connections play crucial role in the definition of the \u2217-product on a symplectic\nmanifold M. As before we assume that dim M = 2n.\nFrom the Darboux theorem (see [26]) for each point p on a symplectic manifold M\nthere exists a chart (Uz , \u03c6z ) such that p \u2208 Uz and on Uz in local coordinates (q 1 , . . . , q 2n )\ndetermined by \u03c6z the symplectic form equals\n\u03c9 = dq n+1 \u2227 dq 1 + . . . + dq 2n \u2227 dq n .\nA chart (Uz , \u03c6z ) is called a Darboux chart. A set of C \u221e compatible Darboux charts\ncovering the whole manifold A = {(Uz , \u03c6z )}z\u2208J constitutes a Darboux atlas on M.\nSuppose that on the tangent bundle T M a torsion-free connection is done.

In Darboux coordinates the exterior covariant derivative \u2202v of\nv \u2208 C \u221e (P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M)) reads\n\u2202v = dv +\n\n1\n[\u0393, v].\ni~\n\n(5.74)\n\nThe reason why we restrict ourselfs to Darboux charts is obvious - only in such\ncharts connection is represented by a form with values in the Weyl algebra.\nIn Fedosov paper [6] the above relation is just a definition of the exterior covariant\nderivative in the Weyl bundle. We showed its geometrical origin.\nFrom the fact that the exterior covariant derivative in the Weyl bundle can be put\ninto frames of the algebra structure, we deduce that also curvature of the symplectic\nconnection may be defined in terms of P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M). Indeed, curvature of the symplectic connection \u0393 is a smooth section C \u221e (P \u2217 M[[~]] \u2297 \u039b2 (M)) and can be written\nas\n1\nR = d\u0393 + \u0393 \u25e6 \u0393.\n(5.75)\ni~\nThe action of R on a smooth section X of a tangent bundle T M is given by\n1\nR(X) = Rijkl X i X j dq k \u2227 dq l ,\n4\nwhere\nRijkl =\n\n\u2202\u0393ijl \u2202\u0393ijk\n\u2212\n+ \u03c9 zu \u0393zil \u0393ujk \u2212 \u03c9 zu \u0393zik \u0393ujl .\n\u2202q k\n\u2202q l\n\n(5.76)\n\nThus the second exterior covariant derivative of v \u2208 C \u221e (P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M)) is described\nby a formula\n1\n\u2202 2 v = [R, v].\n(5.77)\ni~\n\n6\n\nThe \u2217-product on a symplectic manifold M\n\nCrucial role in deformation quantization is played by a noncommutative nonabelian \u2217product being a counterpart of the product of operators from Hilbert space formulation\nof quantum theory. There is no unique way to introduce this product in case when the\nphase space of the system is different from R2n . In this section we present briefly the\n23\n\n\fFedosov construction of the \u2217-product on a symplectic manifold (M, \u03c9). We concentrate\non a geometric aspect of the problem omitting all of technical proofes.\nThere exists infinitely many different connections in the bundle P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M).\nEspecially important to our purposes is one of so called abelian connections \u0393\u0303.\nDefinition 6.8. A connection\n\u0393\u0303 is called abelian, if its curvature \u03a9 is a 2-form with\nL\u221e\n\u2217\nvalues in the bundle k=0 ((T M)0k \u2295 (T \u2217 M)0k ) \u2297 \u039b2 (M).\nIn the definition we put (T \u2217 M)0k = (T \u2217 M)0 for every k.\n\nSince that for each v \u2208 C \u221e (P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M)) the second exterior covariant derivative\nD determined by \u0393\u0303 equals (compare (5.77))\nD2v =\n\n1\n[\u03a9, v] = 0.\ni~\n\n(6.78)\n\nFrom among the set of abelian connections especially important for physical applications is the one of the form\ndef.\n\n\u0393\u0303(X) = \u03c9i,j X i dq j + \u0393i1 i2 ,j X i1 X i2 dq j + r.\n\n(6.79)\n\nThe term r \u2208 P \u2217 M[[~]] \u2297 \u039b1 (M), deg(r) \u2265 3 is determined by some recurrential\nformula (for details see [6], [7]) and it depends only on the symplectic curvature R. In\nthis case\n1\n\u03a9 = \u2212 \u03c9j1j2 dq j1 \u2227 dq j2 .\n2\nTo avoid confusion which indices are of the Weyl bundle and which ones of a differential\nform we put in (6.79) the result of acting by \u0393\u0303 on some arbitrary fixed vector field from\nthe tangent bundle T M.\nIt is easy to notice that the component of the abelian connection (6.79) with the\ndegree z acting on the form v \u2208 P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M) gives as a result the element\nu \u2208 P \u2217 M[[~]]\u039b(M) for which\ndeg(u) = deg(v) + z \u2212 2.\n(deg(v))\n\nSince that denoting by \u031f\n \u0303 (deg(u)) a part of the connection matrix \u031f appearing as the\nresult of presence of the abelian connection \u0393\u0303 we see that\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\n0\n0 ...\n1\n\uf8ef (2) \u031f\n(2)\n\uf8fa\n \u0303 (1)\n\u031f\n \u0303 (3) . . . \uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u031f\n\uf8fa\n\u031f\n \u0303 =\uf8ef\n(6.80)\n2\n(3)\n\uf8ef 0 \u031f\n \u0303 (2) \u031f . . . \uf8fa\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n..\n..\n..\n..\n.\n.\n.\n.\n(compare (5.72)). Notice that the abelian connection \u0393\u0303 mixes up tensors of different\nranges and terms standing at different powers of the deformation parameter ~.\n24\n\n\fWhat is interesting, the set of 0-forms belonging to P \u2217 M[[~]] \u2297 \u039b0 (M) such that\nDv = 0, constitutes the subalgebra of the Weyl algebra P \u2217 M[[~]].

Let f1 , f2 be two smooth sections of C \u221e ( \u221e\nk=0 ((T M)k \u2295 (T M)k ))\n.

It has the following properties:\n\n1. The definition of \u2217-product is invariant under Darboux transformations. Since\nthat we can multiply functions on an arbitrary symplectic manifold. In case of\nthe Moyal product of the Weyl type we are restricted to the symplectic manifold\nR2n and Darboux coordinates with vanishing 1-form of a symplectic connection\n\u0393 = 0. In fact we could extend the definition of \u2217-product on an arbitrary atlas\non the symplectic manifold M, but in such case it would be necessary to modify\nrecurrential formulas for the term r in (6.79) and for \u03c3 \u22121 .\n2. In the limit ~ \u2192 0+ the \u2217-product of f1 , f2 \u2208 C \u221e ((T \u2217 M)00 \u2295 (T \u2217 M)00 ) turns into\nthe commutative point-wise multiplication of functions, i.e.\nlim f1 \u2217 f2 = f1 * f2 .\n\n~\u21920+\n\n(6.82)\n\nThis relation expresses the fact that the classical mechanics is a limit of quantum\nphysics for the Planck constant tending to 0+ .\n3. The multiplication (6.81) is associative but noncommutative.\nThe noncommutaL\n\u2217\n0\n((T\nM)\n\u2295\n(T \u2217 M)0k )) is meativity of two smooth sections f1 , f2 \u2208 C \u221e ( \u221e\nk\nk=0\nsured by their Moyal bracket\ndef.\n\n{f1 , f2 }M =\n\n1\n(f1 \u2217 f2 \u2212 f2 \u2217 f1 )\ni~\n\n25\n\n\fwhich plays a role of commutator from standard formulation of quantum mechanics on Hilbert space.\n4. When M = R2n the product defined above is just the Moyal product of Weyl\ntype. This fact confirms consistency of the Fedosov approach with the best known\ncase of quantum deformation.\nSome computations done with the \u2217-product (6.81) can be found in [8].\nAcknowledgments\nI am grateful to Prof. Manuel Gadella from the Valladolid University for indicating\ndifficulties in construction of infinite dimensional spaces.
