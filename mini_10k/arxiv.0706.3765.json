After better and better\nexperimental methods for polarising a broad range of different\nparticles have been developed in the last decades, experiments\nwith spin variables represent one of the most significant methods for investigations in subatomic physics.\nHowever, the particularly significant case of the antiproton\nis still not available for experimental investigations due to the\nlack of a source of polarised antiprotons. Such a source would\nallow for studies with isospin and spin symmetry in the interaction of nucleons at low, medium and high energies. In order\nto substantiate this, three fields are mentioned:\n1. Spectroscopy of hadrons:\nThe annihilation of antiprotons on protons produces a multitude of final states with two or more mesons (for a summary see [1]). They carry the potential of containing new\nstates, so called exotics, like glue balls or hybrid states\ncomposed of quarks and gluons. However, the analysis of\nthe final states is hampered by the need to perform a partial wave analysis which is frequently not unique. The exploitation of spin degrees of freedom for both the projectile\nantinucleon and the target nucleon would at least halve the\ncontributing amplitudes and increase the significance of the\nsearch for exotics considerably.\nFurthermore, the study of known states would be more selective making an identification clearer and offer an additional parameter in the decay dynamics.\n\n2. Antinucleon-nucleon scattering and reactions:\nThe same arguments hold for antinucleon-nucleon elastic\nscattering. These cross sections have been measured from\nclose to threshold up to many GeV. One particularly intriguing aspect is the spin and isospin dependence of the\nantinucleon-nucleon interaction at low energies. As is well\nknown the nucleon-nucleon and antinucleon-nucleon potentials are connected in the still very successful meson\nexchange description by the G-parity symmetry. However,\nwhereas it appears that the long range part of the potential\nis in this way reasonably well described by pion exchange,\nthere is no sensitivity to the short range part attributed to\nthe vector meson exchange, since the annihilation dominates for radii shorter than about 0.8 fm (for summaries\nsee [2,3]). The different spin orientations in the entrance\nchannel close to threshold, where s- and p-wave scattering\ndominate, will provide sensitivity to vector mesons, i.e. to\nthe short range of the real part of the antinucleon-nucleon\ninteraction.\nFor the annihilation dynamics the question whether the quark\nreorientation or the gluonic quark fusion-creation mechanism (OZI rule violation) prevails is not satisfactorily answered. New data with spin degrees of freedom would provide very significant constraints.\n3. Antinucleon-nucleon interactions at the parton level:\nThe generalised parton distributions received recently great\nattention. It appears that the transversity distribution would\nbecome accessible in reactions of polarised antiprotons and\nprotons (for a summary see e.g. [4]). Of course, the experimental efforts for such a study would be considerable\n\n\f2\n\nTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A. Jankowiak: A surprising method for polarising antiprotons.\n\nbeyond the realisation of a polarised antiproton source. Recently the PAX collaboration has proposed just such an\ninvestigation for the FAIR facility being prepared at GSI,\nhowever, without showing an effective method of polarising antiprotons [5].\nThough antiprotons are stable all proposals to polarise them\nhave been less than satisfactory so far. Of the many proposals [6] only two possibilities have been considered as possibly feasible. In the first, the Filtex collaboration has considered\nthe different attenuation of the spin components of an initially\nunpolarised antiproton beam due to the difference of the singlet and triplet scattering cross sections in the interaction with\na polarised hydrogen gas target. In a pilot experiment with\nprotons instead of antiprotons at the Test Storage Ring TSR\nof the Max-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics at Heidelberg\nin 1992 [7,8,9] this collaboration did indeed find a small effect. The rate of polarisation was, however, only dPb /dt =\n(0.0124 \u00b1 0.0006)/h, a factor of two smaller than expected\ntheoretically. This is interpreted by Meyer [11] as due to the\ncontribution of the polarised electrons in the polarised hydrogen target. Beside the slow polarisation build-up the scheme is\nquestionable for antiprotons since the total annihilation cross\nsection is two times larger than the elastic scattering and most\nlikely little spin dependent meaning that the beam will be quickly\nreduced in intensity. Additionally, the Coulomb scattering in\nthe hydrogen gas target reduces the beam lifetime greatly.\nThe second possibility is the spin transfer in the scattering\nof initially unpolarised nucleons/antinucleons from polarised\nelectrons of a gas target placed in the coasting beam of a storage ring [10]. This idea has been taken up recently [12] and\nused as the basis for the proposal of the PAX collaboration\n[5]. However, the internal polarised hydrogen gas target will\nCoulomb scatter the antiproton beam and makes the use of a\nvery large aperture storage ring mandatory. Therefore, it is not\neasy to characterise the performance of this method with a few\nnumbers. Table 1 tries to transform the presentation of ref. [12]\ninto numbers which can be compared later to the method proposed in this article.\nThe meaning of the parameters is evident with the exception of the important single particle space charge limit. It has\nbeen calculated using the formula for coasting beams of ref. [13]:\n\u2206Q\n2\n3\nNmax\n= 2\u03c0\u03b5\u03b2lab\n\u03b3lab\nrp\u22121 \u2206Q,\n(1)\np\n2 , r = 1.5 am is\nwhere \u03b2lab = vlab /c, \u03b3lab = 1/ 1 \u2212 \u03b2lab\np\nthe \"classical proton radius\" and \u2206Q is the incoherent tune\nshift/spread. For common reference the value \u2206Q = 0.015,\na value commonly accepted for the operation of storage rings,\nhas been chosen.\nThe optimisation of these numbers depends on the way\nthe polarised antiprotons would be used in a certain experiment. We have chosen the example of a low energy antiproton\npolariser ring and the high energy experimental storage ring\nHESR of the FAIR project at GSI [12] in order to make a direct comparison possible. However, as we shall discuss in section 4.2, the method proposed here can be adapted to many\ndifferent situations in storage rings at low and high antiproton\nenergies.\nAs a summary we note that a polariser has to be evaluated\nby considering\n\nexample\n\u03a8acc /mrad\n\u03b5/mm mrad\nT/MeV\np/(MeV/c)\n\u03b2 = v/c\n\u2206Q\nNmax\nR\nNmax\n50%\n\u03c4pol\n/hours\n\u03c4AP /hours\n50%\nNpol\n\nITa\n\nITb\n\nITc\n\n50\n500\n39\n273\n0.28\n2.7 * 1012\n3.6 * 1010\n39.8\n16.7\n3.3 * 109\n\n30\n180\n61\n344\n0.34\n1.5 * 1012\n3.6 * 1010\n13.9\n4.6\n1.8 * 109\n\n10\n20\n167\n584\n0.53\n0.6 * 1012\n3.6 * 1010\n6.3\n1.2\n1.9 * 108\n\nTable 1.

This idea, considered since the early phase\nof the Low Energy Antiproton Ring LEAR at CERN, was,\nhowever, never thoroughly pursued since reliable calculations\nof the cross sections for the polarisation transfer adapted to the\nsituation in a storage ring were missing. However, as will be\nshown in the following section 2 the cross sections for polarisation transfer from the electron to the antiproton (like signs\nof charges) are dramatically smaller than the ones for positronantiproton transfer (unlike signs of charges). This means that a\npolarised positron source of sufficient flux density is needed. In\nsection 3 we demonstrate that several options exist, all meeting\nor exceeding the required intensity.\nThe basis of our proposal is a new QED calculation including Coulomb distortions presented in section 2 for systems\nwith like and unlike charge signs [14,15]. It shows that the\ntotal polarisation-transfer-cross sections at small energies become very large. However, as will be discussed in some detail\nin section 4 only the spin-flip part of the cross section can polarise a beam in a storage ring. Therefore the considerations of\nHorowitz and Meyer [10,11] are not correct since they treat the\nnon-spin-flip part only. This was recently correctly pointed out\nby Milstein and Strakhovenko [16]. However, as will emerge\nin section 2.1 the statement of these authors that the spin-flip\ncross section due to the hyperfine interaction is generally neg-\n\n\fTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A. Jankowiak: A surprising method for polarising antiprotons.\n\nligible is not correct. At very small energies this cross section\nbecomes very large if one includes the distortions due to the\nCoulomb attraction of particles with unlike electric charges.\nIn principle the polarisation transfer cross sections from\nelectrons to nucleons have been calculated in the framework\nof QED since a long time [17,18,19,20,21] and extensively\nbeen used for the measurement of the electric form factor of\nthe neutron and proton (see e.g. [22,23]). However, these calculations are correctly neglecting the spin-flip part, being small\nfor the high energiy electrons used for these experiments, and\nconsider the non-spin-flip part in the polarisation transfer only.\nAfter the new calculations of the cross sections have been\nsummarised in section 2 we present in section 3 a discussion of\nsources of polarised positrons mostly based on a modest extrapolation of existing technologies. They will be shown to suffice\nfor a realistic scheme in storage rings in section 4.

It is apparent that below a kinetic energy of 10 MeV Coulomb\neffects continue to strongly suppress both cross sections, the reduction rapidly increasing with decreasing kinetic energy.\nThe corresponding results for the proton case are shown in\nFig. 3. In contrast to the antiproton case one notes here a very\nrapid increase of the integrated polarisation cross sections with\ndecreasing energy. This rapid increase is caused essentially by\nthe strong attraction of the Coulomb field pulling in the scattering wave towards small distances. It is governed by a factor\ne\u22122\u03c0\u03b7c (for details see Ref. [14]) which grows very fast with\ndecreasing energy (i.e. increasing \u03b7c ) because for proton electron scattering one has \u03b7c < 0.\nFinally, we show in Fig. 4 the ratio hS2\u2212 i/hS2 i for proton electron scattering which governs the final proton net polarisation\n(see Section 4).\n\n1e-05\n\n0.1\n\n1\nTh [MeV]\n\n10\n\nh\nFig. 2.

The working principle is angular selective absorption in low Z absorbers with subsequent moderation in\nhigh-purity metal sheets.\nThe Michigan source was based on a 22 Na emitter (\u03b2 +\nendpoint energy 0.544 MeV) with an activity of 1.7 GBq.

Positron beam temperatures of less\nthan 100 K have been observed when the moderator was cooled\nto\n\u221a 23 K [29]. Since the normalised beam emittance scales \u221d\nT a much smaller emittance per emitting area compared to\na thermionic (electron) cathode can be obtained. The geometric emittance of the polarised positron beam generated from the\n0.3 mm diameter spot at the surface will therefore approach the\nemittance of the cooled antiproton beam (see section 4.2). This\nmeans that additional solenoid focusing of the positron beam\ncould then be given up offering complete freedom for choosing\nthe spin direction in the interaction region of positrons and antiprotons. Since the initial energy of the positron beam is very\nlow the desired spin orientation of the positrons can be obtained\nwith very compact spin manipulators as already demonstrated\nby the Michigan group. Following the spin manipulation an\nelectrostatic post-accelerator will provide the kinetic energies\nwhich are required for the two design examples presented in\nTable 2.\n3.2 Pulsed positron source with a storage ring\n\nA more effective use of polarised positrons can be made by\ninjecting them as a pulse into a low energy storage ring. Low\nenergy lepton storage rings have already been proposed [30,31]\nand are expected to work stably for several seconds at currents\nof many mA. In order to achieve single turn injection the pulse\nlength should be well below the revolution time. For our purabsorption/moderation process limited the beam intensity to\nposes we assume a revolution time of 50 ns corresponding to\n5 +\n5 * 10 e /s with a polarisation of Pe+ = 0.48.

The polarisation of the\npositrons can now be determined by realising that hE+ i/E\u03b3 \u2248\n15.5/18.5 = 0.84. From Fig. 5.05 and 5.06 of ref. [38] one\nreads off P+L = 0.96 so that we end with an effective polarisation of the positrons of Pe+ = 0.76. We estimate polarisation\nlosses due to large angle Mott-scattering in the positron production target to be negligible.\n\nFig. 5. The different stages of the pulsed positron source. A: source\nof polarised electrons, B: linear electron rf-accelerator for acceleration to 23 MeV, C: combined bremsstrahl and positron production target, D: momentum analyser and solid angel selection, E: focusing into\nthe linear positron rf-decelerator, F: linear positron rf-decelerator, G:\nelectrostatic decelerator, H&I: terminal at +1 MV high voltage with\nmoderator (H) and buncher (I), J: electrostatic accelerator.\n\nof the routine operation at MAMI [36,37], well within reach of\nongoing development as discussed below. The 4 \u03bcs pulse can\neasily be produced at the source of polarised electrons by gain\nswitching a commercial high power semiconductor laser.\nAfter acceleration the electron beam will be focused on a\nTungsten (Z = 74, Ar = 183.8) bremsstrahl target of 1 mm\nthickness. From the Bethe-Heitler cross section we estimate for\nthe given peak current of 1.7 A a flux of 1.2*1013 photons/(4\u03bc spulse) for the energy interval from 16 to 23 MeV in a cone with\na polar angle of 2\u25e6 . All photons in this interval can produce\nan electron-positron pair with a total energy of the positron of\nE+ = (p2+ + me c2 )1/2 = 15.5 MeV.\nAs we shall see in section 4.2 we need a good definition\nof the kinetic energy of the positrons. Therefore, we cut out of\nthe broad positron spectrum a bite of \u03b4 p/p+ = \u00b12.5 * 10\u22122\nor \u03b4 E+ \u2248 \u03b4 p+ = 700 keV. The design of a suitable beamhandling system allowing this cut poses no problem.\nWe now use the bremsstrahl target also as conversion target\nof the circularly polarised photons into longitudinally polarised\npositrons. The positrons will be produced over the full length of\n\nHowever, after passing the momentum selection the positrons still have a energy spread too large to be usable in the\npositron storage ring. At this stage we can make use of the\nmoderation techniques already discussed for the dc-source in\nsection 3.1. The positrons are decelerated by a further linear\naccelerator from 15.5 MeV down to about 1.75 MeV and then\nfurther to 750 keV by means of a high voltage stage. In the terminal of this high voltage stage we place the moderator. After\npassing the moderator the positrons are accelerated again up\nto the optimal kinetic energy needed for the spin transfer. For\nour example discussed in section 4.2.2 this energy is \u2248 1 MeV\nwhich the positron beam acquires by leaving the high voltage\nstage towards ground potential.\nThe initial transverse momenta are relatively large, thus\nbeam guidance has to be provided in the decelerator by a strong\nlongitudinal solenoid field. For the parameters discussed in the\nfollowing a solenoid field of 0.5 T suffices. Before entering the\ndecelerator the transverse momenta will be reduced by expanding the beam and collimating it with a suitable lens. Assuming\nan increase of the beam diameter from initially 2 to 10 mm this\nwill lead to maximum beam angles at the moderator surface\nof less than 11\u25e6 . The depolarisation originating from the different orientations of the positron momenta can be neglected.\nThe transverse emittance of the positron beam leaving the moderator will of course be much larger than in the case of the\ndc-source, but this is partially compensated for by the higher\nbeam energy at the exit. The geometric emittance for the injection into the positron storage ring will therefore be about\n3\u03c0 mm mrad. It is important to note that an energy width of\nless than 0.1 eV is obtained after the moderation resulting in\na longitudinal phase space of \u03b5L \u2248 0.4 keV ns well below the\nacceptance of the positron storage ring. Before injection the\n\n\f8\n\nTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A. Jankowiak: A surprising method for polarising antiprotons.\n\npositron pulse must be compressed in time by a factor of 80 to\n50 ns by a bunching system which, however, is not problematic.\nCompared to a radioactive \u03b2 + -source we find that the decelerated positron beam when hitting the moderator has a similar energy and energy width but is better collimated. We therefore expect that the overall efficiencies for moderation of radioactive sources of about 0.7% [40] can be doubled. Multiplying the total number of highly polarised positrons given above\nwith the estimated moderator efficiency of 0.015 leaves us with\n6 * 105 e+ /(4\u03bcs-pulse). It is interesting to note that a very similar positron target has been proposed in ref. [41].\nWe therefore project the injection of pulses with 6 * 105\npositrons into the low energy storage ring which results in a\nstored current of 1.2 * 1013 e+ s\u22121 or 2 \u03bcA, exceeding the value\nof the dc-source by a factor of 2000. As will be discussed in detail in the next section the storage ring must be refilled as soon\nas a considerable fraction of positrons has transferred their polarisation to the antiprotons. Thus a high repetition rate of the\ndriver pulse is demanded for. The limiting factor for the driver\nrate is the photocathode lifetime. Presently operating conditions at MAMI allow for the extraction of 200 C within one\nlifetime of the photocathode [37] yielding 220 hours of continuous operation for the 250 \u03bcA average current required here.\nSince photocathode regeneration can be obtained within less\nthan two hours by the techniques developed at MAMI [36] it\nfollows that downtime will be negligible.\nWe have already performed test experiments with average\npolarised beam currents exceeding 10 mA [42]. These results\nsuggest that operation of a polarised source with sufficiently\nlong lifetime at even an average current of 30 mA is possible.\nThis corresponds to a repetition frequency of 1500 Hz with the\nsame number of positrons per pulse as above. However, one has\nto optimise the peak current, the repetition frequency, i.e. the\naverage current, and the cathode lifetime. Since this depends\non parameters specific for different applications we have not\ndone this optimisation.\nIf even higher currents of stored polarised positrons are\nneeded one can resort to the more expensive concept of radiative polarisation (Sokolov-Ternov effect) [43]. For the VEPP2000 project (a storage ring of 4 m radius operating at 1 GeV) it\nis envisaged to polarise 1011 positrons within 12 minutes by radiative polarisation [44]. After polarisation a considerable fraction of the positrons could be decelerated and injected into the\nlow energy storage ring.\n\n4 Realisation with a storage ring\nAfter the two essential ingredients, the polarisation-transfer\ncross sections and the source of polarised positrons have been\npresented, we want to show how one can build an antiproton polariser based on them. The basic idea is to let the two\nbeams move in parallel with a small relative velocity, i.e. a\nsmall relative kinetic energy, and take advantage of the large\npolarisation-transfer cross section of the leptons to the hadrons\nin forward direction, making up for the relatively low density\nof the beam of polarised positrons. (In the following we follow the notation of section 2. Therefore the lepton stands the\nfor positron/electron and the hadron for the antiproton/proton,\nrespectively.)\n\n4.1 Polarisation build-up\n4.1.1 Polarisation build-up with a dc-positron source.\nFirstly, we want to calculate the polarisation build-up in an antiproton storage ring using a dc-positron source, the beam of\nwhich overlaps with the antiproton beam. We go into the rest\nframe of the circulating antiproton beam and can use the results of section 2 directly since the cross sections transform as\nscalars. The quantities in this system are indicated by primes.\nThough it is not mandatory for all cases (see section 3) we\nassume to transport the polarised lepton beam by means of a\nsolenoid with its field in the longitudinal beam direction in order to guarantee a diameter of 2 mm over the full overlap length\nand to guide the positron beam. Consequently, we chose the\nquantisation axis (longitudinal spin direction) in the direction\nof the solenoid field. This means one has to provide a Siberian\nsnake in the ring for rotating the spin longitudinally at the entrance of the solenoid after one circulation.\nFor the application of eqs. (34) and (35) we have firstly to\nrecall the definition of the polarisation of a particle beam:\nPbeam =\n\nN+ \u2212 N\u2212\nN+ + N\u2212\n\n(36)\n\nwhere N+/\u2212 denotes the number of particles with spin parallel and antiparallel to the polarisation axis, respectively. This\ndefinition means that we have to find a difference of the cross\nsections for the two spin projections along the polarisation axis\nin a certain kinematical situation. We realise easily that the interactions of case (i) (no spin-flip) cannot polarise the hadron\nbeam in a storage ring. The maximal scattering angle of an\u2032\ntiprotons from an electron target is \u03b8max\n= me /mp \u2248 0.5 mr.\nThis angle has to be transformed into the ring system giving\n\u03b8max \u226a \u03b8acc where \u03b8acc is the acceptance angle of the storage ring. This means that due to the kinematics in the storage\nring all particles, whether scattered or not, are recollected in\nthe beam and, therefore, the polarisation of the coasting beam\nis unchanged. Another way of looking at this situation is to\nimagine that the scattered hadrons are \"taken out of the beam\"\n[45]. The scattered hadron ensemble is then indeed polarised\ndue to the different cross sections for opposite hadron spin projections under a finite scattering angle in a certain solid angle\n(see eq. (16). These hadrons are missing in the hadron beam\nand leave the beam with a polarisation just, equal but opposite\nin sign, to the polarisation of the scattered hadrons. Since the\nscattered hadrons and the remaining beam are not separated geometrically but stay in the coasting beam, no polarisation can\nbe build up on the basis of the cross sections of case (i) in subsection 2.1.\nOn the other hand, the cross sections of case (ii) in subsection 2.1 are describing a spin-flip, i.e. the hadrons interacting\naccording to these change the spin projection. However, only if\nthe spin-flip is asymmetric for a given lepton polarisation \u03bbli a\nnet polarisation within the coasting beam can be achieved. This\nis, however, just the case here since\nh\nh\n\u03c3\u2212,+,\u03bb\nl 6= \u03c3+,\u2212,\u03bbl .\ni\n\ni\n\n(37)\n\nThe distinction of case (i) and (ii) in section 2.1 has been\nobscured in the past by an unfortunate nomenclature. The polarisation transfer, due to the scattering without spin-flip has\n\n\fTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A. Jankowiak: A surprising method for polarising antiprotons.\n\nbeen called \"spin transfer\" [10,11] suggesting spin-flip. The\nfact that the term hS2+ i is not describing spin-flip has been\npointed out by Milstein and Strakhovenko [16] as already mentioned in the introduction. In an earlier version the authors of\nthis paper [47] following refs. [10,11] made the same mistake\nand used their hPzz \u03c3i which is the same as the d\u03c3/d\u03a9Kj00i of\nref. [10]. Therefore, as shown in section 2, it is not enough to\nconsider the polarisation transfer, i.e. cross sections with two\nspin degrees of freedom, but one has to study the triple-spincross sections.\nWe now can proceed and calculate the rate of change of the\nnumber of particles with a given hadron spin projection in the\nring. First, we consider all quantities in the rest frame of the\nleptons and indicate them by a prime. We apply the eqs. (34)\nand (35) to the macroscopic ensemble of the beam in the ring\nwith N\u03bb\u2032 the number of particles of the spin projection \u03bb yielding:\n\u2032\n(38)\n\u1e44\u2212\u03bb\n= \u03c3\u2212\u03bb,\u03bb,\u03bbli j\u03bbl\u2032l N\u03bb\u2032 ,\n\nwhere\nkh = nl0 fh l\n\nwhere\nnl\u2032\u03bbl\ni\n\n=\n\n\u2032\nnl\u2032\u03bbl \u03b2relative\nc\ni\n\n\u1e44+ = \u03ba+ N\u2212 \u2212 \u03ba\u2212 N+\n\nis the relative velocity of the leptons against the hadrons. For\neasier notation we introduce the \"helicity\" h\u03bbli = nl\u2032\u03bbl /nl\u20320 , the\ni\n\nfraction of leptons of the spin projection \u03bbli of the total lepton\ndensity nl\u20320 = nl\u2032+ + nl\u2032\u2212 . (The helicity is defined in different\nways in the literature, but it is convenient to define it here in\nthis way.) We realise that h\u03bbli = (1/2)(1 + \u03bbli Pl ) where Pl is\nthe absolute polarisation of the macroscopic lepton beam.\nNow we Lorentz transform eq. (38) to the ring frame indicated by unprimed quantities with \u03b2beam c the velocity of the\nhadrons in the rest frame of the ring. Firstly, the lepton density is given by nl\u20320 = nl0 \u03b3beam due to the length contraction.\nSecondly, the time dilatation gives a factor of 1/\u03b3beam on the\nright hand side of eq. (38) cancelling with the previous one.\n\u2032\nThe transformation of the relative velocity \u03b2relative\nc gives:\n\u03b2relative\n1 \u2212 \u03b2beam (\u03b2beam \u00b1 \u03b2relative )\n\u03b2relative\n2\n= \u03b2relative \u03b3beam\n\u2248\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03b2beam\n\n\u2032\n\u03b2relative\n=\n\n(39)\n(40)\n\nif \u03b2relative \u226a \u03b2beam . We also observe that the integrated cross\nsections are scalars and the same in all reference systems. Further, N\u03bb\u2032 h = N\u03bbh is conserved.\nThe rate of eq. (38) has to be multiplied by the ratio of\nthe interaction length l of the lepton beam with the antiproton\nbeam over the circumference of the ring L. If fh is the hadron\nrevolution frequency one has l/L = fh l/(\u03b2beam c). Putting all\ntogether eq. (38) reads:\n\u1e44\u2212\u03bb = \u03c3\u2212\u03bb,\u03bb,\u03bbli nl0 h\u03bbli fh l\n\n\u03b2relative 2\n\u03b3\nN\u03bb\n\u03b2beam beam\n\n(41)\n\nSince the lepton beam has a finite polarisation we have to add\nthe rates of the two lepton-spin projections:\nX\n\u1e44\u2212\u03bb =\n\u03c3\u2212\u03bb,\u03bb,\u03bbli h\u03bbli kh N\u03bb\n(42)\n\u03bbli\n\n= \u03ba\u2212\u03bb N\u03bb\n\n(43)\n\n(45)\n\n\u1e44\u2212 = \u03ba\u2212 N+ \u2212 \u03ba+ N\u2212\n\n(46)\n\n\u03ba+ = (\u22122hS2\u2212 iPl \u2212 hS2 i) kh\n\n(47)\n\nwith\n\nis the current density of the lepton,\n\n\u2032\nis the lepton density with the spin projection \u03bbli , and \u03b2relative\nc\n\n(44)\n\nWe can now write down the overall accounting of the rate\nof change of spin projections. Since no hadrons are scattered\nout of the ring N+ + N\u2212 = N0 with N0 the total constant\nnumber of hadrons coasting in the ring we have to observe\n\u1e44+ = \u2212\u1e44\u2212 . This means we have to subtract from the rate of\nchange of one spin projection the rate of change of the opposite\nspin projection:\n\ni\n\nj\u03bbl\u2032l\ni\n\n\u03b2relative 2\n\u03b3\n.\n\u03b2beam beam\n\n9\n\n\u03ba\u2212 =\n\n(+2hS2\u2212 iPl\n\n\u2212 hS2 i) kh\n\n(48)\n\nIt is again convenient to introduce the helicities of the hadron\nbeam H+ = N+ /N0 and H\u2212 = N\u2212 /N0 with the beam polarisation Ph yielding:\nP \u0307h = 2\u03ba+ H\u2212 \u2212 2\u03ba\u2212 H+\n\n(49)\n\nFrom this one finds the differential equation for the beam polarisation build-up\nP \u0307h = (\u03ba+ \u2212 \u03ba\u2212 ) \u2212 (\u03ba+ + \u03ba\u2212 )Ph\n\n(50)\n\nwith the solution\nPh (t) = 2Pl\n\nhS2\u2212 i\n{1 \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03bah t]}\nhS2 i\n\u2212 Ph (t = 0) exp[\u2212\u03bah t] (51)\n\nwith\n\u03bah = 2|hS2 i|kh .\n\n(52)\n\nIt is evident from these formulae that the maximal polarisahS \u2212 i\n\ntion is given by Phmax = 2|Pl hS22 i |. One reads from Fig. 4 the\nsomewhat disappointing Phmax = 0.28 below 100 keV given by\nnature. We note that the polarisation build-up is determined by\nhS2 i only.\nThe intense beam of an electron cooler is unpolarised. Since\nthe calculation of the spin-flip cross section cannot be performed at a kinetic energy Th \u2192 0 as given for the cooler, one\nmay worry about the depolarising effect of the cooler. For the\nantiprotons in focus here, the spin-flip cross sections with electrons are many orders of magnitude smaller due to the Coulomb\nrepulsion (see section 2). Even if we take the maximal cross\nsections for electrons the achievable current density in electron\ncoolers of about 10 mA/mm2 yield \u03bacooler \u2248 1/(10, 000 h) for\na realistic storage ring, much too low to produce a noticeable\neffect. For the proposed test experiments (see section 5), however, this point may have to be considered by switching the\ncooler on and off. However, the classical limit suggests that\nhS2\u2212 i \u2192 0 for Th \u2192 0.\n\n\f10\n\nTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A. Jankowiak: A surprising method for polarising antiprotons.\n\n4.1.2 Polarisation build-up with a pulsed positron source.\nWith the dc-positron source we can assume that the polarisation of the lepton beam is constant since it is refed permanently\nand polarisation loss is negligible by its one path through the\ninteraction region. In the situation of two overlapping storage\nring beams, the beams interact for long times. The polarising\nlepton beam is not anymore a source with constant polarisation, but looses polarisation too and regains polarisation from\nthe hadrons. If left for a sufficiently long time finally an equilibrium between the two beams will occur. However, the point is\nto refill the lepton ring as often as possible in order to maximise\nthe efficiency. In order to obtain the coupled differential equation for the lepton polarisation it suffices to exchange hadrons\nand leptons in eq. (50) since the cross sections are invariant under the exchange \u03bbhf \u2192 \u03bblf , \u03bbhi \u2192 \u03bbli and \u03bbli \u2192 \u03bbhi .

Figure 6 shows the magnification of Fig. 3 suggesting a choice of Th = 0.0017 MeV\nyielding hS2 i = \u22122 * 1013 barn. This choice guarantees the\nvalidity of the DW calculation (see refs.

This\nis inconvenient since the solutions of eqs. (54) and (55) have\nto be applied iteratively following the numbers of refills of the\nlepton ring. This means inserting at the beginning of each refill\nthe new initial hadron polarisation and the new initial lepton\npolarisation and then solve the equations anew.

In this\nsubsection we give two examples of an application of the parallel beam method. The first is a specialised polariser ring together with the dc-source sketched in subsection 3.1. It is optimised for fast polarisation build-up, adequate for an external\nfixed target experiment requiring a slowly extracted beam. It\nwould be suit for the experiments mentioned in the introduction under \"1. Spectroscopy of hadrons\" and \"2. Antinucleonnucleon scattering and reactions\" in the introduction. The second is the idea to use a small positron storage ring the beam\nof which overlaps with a storage ring similar to the HESR in\nref. [5]. This configuration was already discussed in subsections 3.2 and 4.1.2. It would be suitable for \"3. Antinucleonnucleon interactions at the parton level\" in order to allow for\na direct comparison of the performance with the scheme presented in ref. [12]. It is, however, not the purpose of this paper\nto present elaborated proposals. There are too many interlinked\nparameters and constraints coming from the specific experiments and the accelerator limitations. Some of the limitations\nand needs for studies in the future will be discussed in section 5.\n\nFirst we want to present a specialised polariser ring optimised\nfor fast polarisation build-up. We start with the parameters of\nthe example PB1 in Table 2 which is close to cooler rings built\nbefore, as e.g. LEAR (see [48] and references therein) or the\nTSR [7]. This design represents a reasonable compromise between size and cost. At the relative kinetic energy of Tp =\n1.7 keV we have the ratio hS2\u2212 i/hS2 i = \u22120.143 (see Fig. 4).\nIf we assume a freely coasting antiproton beam and, in accord\nwith the discussion in subsection 3.1, an average positron current of hIe i = 5 * 109 e+ s\u22121 and all other parameters as given\nin Table 2, we get from eq. (44) \u03bah = 2.38 h\u22121 . Assuming a\npositron polarisation of 0.70 we get according to eq. (51) (see\nFig. 7) an antiproton polarisation of 0.18 after one hour.\nThe coasting beam in a storage ring with the parameters\nassumed for PB1 in Table 2 represents no problem for the particle dynamics. A few aspects are however mentioned in the\nfollowing. The incoherent tune shift spread \u2206Q for our design\nexample is calculated with eq. (1).

Requesting a relative momentum\nspread of \u03b4p/p = \u00b11 * 10\u22124 in the ring system for both the\nantiproton as well as for the positron, standard in modern storage rings, one arrives after Lorentz transforming at an energy\nspread of \u03b4Tp\u0304 / | \u00b1 0.1|Tp\u0304 = | \u00b1 0.17| keV in the rest system\nof the electron. These numbers for the following example PB2\nare so similar that they are not discussed separately.\nThe region of overlap of the antiproton beam and polarised\npositron beam is assumed to have a length of 2 m. In order\nto achieve a good efficiency we need a complete overlap with\nthe smallest diameter possible. The diameter we have assumed\nis 2 mm. As discussed for the dc-source this poses no problem. However, if we want to maintain a diameter for the pulsed\nsource we have to provide a focusing by means of a solenoid.\nThe space charge effects are small and a guiding field of less\nthan 0.01 T suffices to maintain the beam diameter of 2 mm.\nFor this beam diameter we estimate a minimal value of the\nbeta function \u03b2min of the antiproton beam in mid overlap according to\nl/2\n\u03b2min = p\n,\np2 \u2212 1\n\n(56)\n\nwhere p = de /d0 with de the beam diameter at the entrance\nand exit and d0 the diameter at the mid point of the overlap\nregion. With p = 1.1 of we obtain \u03b20 >2.2 m. With this value\nand a beam diameter of 2 mm we get from the relation\n\u03c3x,y =\n\np\n\u03b2x,y \u03b5x,y\n\n(57)\n\n\u03b5x,y = 0.45 mm mrad as the needed emittance for the antiproton beam. This means that we have to cool the antiproton beam\nafter injection before we can efficiently polarise. The cooling\nhas to stay on during polarisation build-up in order to compensate for the intra-beam scattering and the multiple scattering in\nthe rest gas of the ring. Emittances of about 0.1 mm mrad have\nbeen obtained at LEAR and other cooler rings for up to 109\nparticles in the ring [48].\n\n\f12\n\nTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A. Jankowiak: A surprising method for polarising antiprotons.\n\n4.2.2 HESR as polariser ring\n\n0\n\nThe principle of the dc-source could be used by adjusting the\nparameters of the previous design example PB1 to a high energy ring as HESR. On the other hand, the pulsed source offers, as repeatedly mentioned, the interesting option of letting\nthe beam of a positron storage ring overlap with the antiproton\nbeam. This will be investigated in the following.\nWe start by observing that\nnl0 = N0l /(A Ll )\n\n(58)\n\nN0h /(A Lh )\n\n(59)\n\nnh0\n\n=\n\nPh -0.00001\n\n-0.000015\n\n-0.00002\n\nand define:\n(N0h /Lh )fl /\u03b2h\nN0h\nkl\n=\n=\na=\nkh\n(N0l /Ll )fh /\u03b2l\nN0l\n\n-5  \u0301 10-6\n\n(60)\n\nFor the parameters collected in Table 2 for the design example\nPB2 \u03bdh = 2kh |hS2 i| \u2248 2/(6.4 s) and a = 1.6 * 104 giving\n\u03bdl = a\u03bdh \u2248 1/(0.38 ms). The ratio \u03bc/\u03bd = 2hS2\u2212 i/hS2 i can\nbe determined with Fig. 4. We plot the solutions of eqs. (54)\nand (55) with these parameters in Figs. (8), (9), (10), and (11).\nWe can see that the polarisation build-up gets increasingly inefficient with growing initial polarisation. This is due to the\nexchange of spin and angular momentum between the hadron\nand lepton beam. The total spin in the lepton beam is not preserved since the tensor part of the hyperfine interaction transfers spin into angular momentum. For large times both polarisations converge to zero. We also observe that the optimum time, after which the maximum polarisation increase is\nreached, changes with the number of cycles, i.e. initial polarisation of the hadron beam. It is efficient to stop the polarisation\ncycle at this optimum time and wait until the lepton source can\ndeliver the next spill for injection into the lepton ring. We show\nthe iterative polarisation build-up as a function of the number\nof cycles in Fig. 12. If one changes the optimum time from lepton spill to lepton spill one gains somewhat as also shown in\nFig. 12.\nIf we chose \u03b4\u03c4 = 0.2 ms with a repetition (cycle) time\nof \u03c4cyle = 36 ms we get after 105 cycles a total time for polarisation build up of one hour with a polarisation of Ph =\n0.22 * Pl (t = 0). Considering the polarisation of the positrons\nPl = 0.76 we get an effective polarisation of the antiproton\nbeam of 0.17.\nIt is worth noting that one can use the scheme of this section\nwith a cross section hS2 i of up to a factor of hundred smaller\nthan predicted by the DW calculation. The time dependence in\nFigs. 8, 9, 10, and 11 just scales with 1/Sz and the polarisation build-up during one cycle is correspondingly slower. This\nmeans that also \u03b4\u03c4 \u221d 1/hS2 i and one can go up to \u03b4\u03c4 \u2248 \u03c4cycle .\nWe remind that \u03c4cycle is limited by the maximal possible average current of the source of polarised electrons.\n\n5 Discussion and Conclusions\nNow we want to compare the internal target method (IT) [12]\nwith the parallel beam method (PB) of this article on the basis\nof the figure-of-merit FOM = N0 b * Pb2 /\u03c4pbu , where we mean\n\n0\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.01\n\nt\u0090s\n\nFig. 8.

If the time needed to perform\nthe experiment is shorter or comparable to the polarisation cycle time a reduction of the overall efficiency is indicated which\nis, however, difficult to reflect in a FOM since it depends on the\nspecific experiment.\nFor the internal target method we assume a filling time of\none hour since it needs many antiprotons in order to make up\nfor the many particles lost due to Coulomb scattering and annihilation. This means that 9 hours are left for polarisation buildup. Further, the numbers of Table 1 are used.\nFor the parallel beam method PB1 , i.e. polarisation in a separate polariser ring, we can fill the ring in 16.7 minutes and\nconsequently fill and polarise in one hour. With a polarisation\ntime of \u03c4pol. = 1 hour we reach a polarisation of the antiprotons\nof Ph = 0.18.\nFor the parallel beam method PB2 we take as polarisation\nbuild-up time \u03c4pbu = 1 hour using the HESR as polarisation\nring. This means that one cannot use the ring for experiments\nabout half of the time assuming a beam life time of two hours in\nHESR. However, if one would polarise and perform the experiment in parallel, one could do routine detector checks manda-\n\n\fTh. Walcher, H. Arenh\u00f6vel, K. Aulenbacher, R. Barday and A.

The polarisation time for one cycle\n\u03b4\u03c4 is 0.4 ms (light grey boxes) and 0.2 ms (dark grey triangles). The\nblack diamonds show a solution for an optimised polarisation time\ndepending on the number of cycles ranging from \u03b4\u03c4 = 1.7 ms at\nPh (1) = 0 for the beginning of the first cycle to \u03b4\u03c4 = 0.16 ms at\nPh (6 * 104 ) = \u22120.2 for the beginning of the 6 * 104 th cycle. The\ncycles repeat with a frequency of 28 Hz in order to limit the average\ncurrent of the source of polarised electrons.\n\ncally predicted spin-flip cross sections hS2 i and hS2\u2212 i does not\nallow to surpass a maximum polarisation of 0.28. Nevertheless,\nit appears that the parallel beam method is superior over any\nother method proposed so far, since it provides a still reasonable polarisation and a large figure-of-merit at low investments.\nIt should be experimentally verified at an existing storage ring\nas soon as possible in view of the importance for the planning\nat FAIR. Fortunately the electron-proton interaction has unlike\nsigns as the one of positron-antiproton. If one would inject polarised protons in a storage ring and detune the frequently available electron cooler somewhat one could measure the depolarisation time and determine the spin-flip cross section hS2 i (see\neq. (51) with Pl = 0 and Ph (t = 0) 6= 0). However, the spinflip cross section hS2\u2212 i can only be determined using polarised\nleptons. Such a test experiment would completely exclude any\nrisk of an expensive design solely based on the predictions.\nThis work has been supported by the SFB 443 of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) and the German Federal State of Rheinland-Pfalz.\n\nReferences\n1.
