Even\nif most BCDs are not genuinely young\nsystems, their gas-richness and metaldeficiency make them useful objects for\nconstraining the primordial 4 He abundance (Pagel et al. 1992; Masegosa, Moles,\n& Campos-Aguilar 1994; Thuan, Izotov,\n& Lipovetsky 1995; Izotov, Thuan, &\nLipovetsky 1997; Izotov & Thuan 1999)\nand early metal enrichment in galaxies.\nFurthermore, BCDs are ideal laboratories\nfor the study of many topics related to\nstar formation (SF), by avoiding the complications of those mechanisms, such as\ndensity waves, that operate in spiral galaxies (O'Connell, Thuan, & Goldstein 1978;\nThuan 1991; Brosch, Heller, & Almoznino\n1998). Last, it has been suggested that\nthese systems could be the nearby counterparts of the faint blue galaxies detected\nat intermediate redshifts (Koo et al. 1994,\n1995; Guzm\u00e1n et al. 1996, 1997). Should\nthis be the case, BCDs offer the possibility\nof studying the properties of this galaxy\nclass with an accuracy and spatial resolution that cannot be achieved at larger\ndistances.\nIn spite of the interest that these systems have attracted, the basic questions\nconcerning their evolutionary status, formation history and mechanisms that trigger their star-forming activity are still\nopen. In particular, the assessment of\nthe properties of the stellar low-surfacebrightness component (LSBC) underlying\nthe starburst regions in BCDs is a fundamental task. This older component hosts\nmost of the galaxy's stellar mass. Provided that Dark Matter (DM) does not\ndominate the mass within the Holmberg\n\nIntroduction\n\nBlue Compact Dwarf (BCD) galaxies\nwere first defined as compact and lowluminosity objects (starburst diameter \u2264 1\nkpc; MB \u2265 \u221218 mag), with optical spectra similar to those presented by H II regions in spiral galaxies (Sargent & Searle\n1970; Thuan & Martin 1981). Further\nwork showed that they are metal-deficient\ngalaxies - the oxygen abundance of their\nionized gas varying between Z\u2299 /50 and\nZ\u2299 /2 - which form stars at a rate that\nwould exhaust their gas content on a time\nscale much shorter than the age of the\nUniverse. Nowadays it seems clear that\namong the galaxies originally classified as\nBCDs we find a wide range of luminosities\n(\u221212 \u2265 MB \u2265 \u221221 mag) and morphologies, the latter probably reflecting different\nevolutionary states and star formation histories (Loose & Thuan 1986; Noeske et al.\n2000; Kunth & \u00d6stlin 2000; Cair\u00f3s et al.\n2001a, 2002; Bergvall & \u00d6stlin 2002). Initially it was hypothesized that BCDs are\ntruly young galaxies, forming their first\ngeneration of stars (Sargent & Searle 1970;\nLequeux & Viallefond 1980; Kunth & Sargent 1986; Kunth, Maurogordato, & Vigroux 1988); the subsequent detection of\nan extended, redder stellar host galaxy in\nthe vast majority of them has revealed\nthat most BCDs are old systems (Loose\n& Thuan 1986; Telles 1995; Papaderos et\nal. 1996a; Doublier et al. 1997; Doublier,\nCaulet, & Comte 1999; Cair\u00f3s 2000; Cair\u00f3s\net al. 2001a,b; Bergvall & \u00d6stlin 2002) undergoing recurrent star-forming episodes\n(Thuan 1991; Mas-Hesse & Kunth 1999).\nBCDs are attracting a great deal of\ninterest in astrophysical research, as it\nhas become clear that they could be the\n2\n\n\fThe present study constitutes the third\npart of an extensive multiwavelength investigation of nearby BCDs. In the first stage\nof this program (Paper I) optical broadband images of 28 BCDs were used to examine the optical morphology and study\nthe photometric structure of these systems\nby means of deep surface photometry. In\nPaper II we provided integrated photometry of the galaxies and produced an atlas\nof detailed color and H\u03b1 maps.\nFrom the latter study it was concluded\nthat the structural parameters and the\nevolutionary status of the stellar population underlying the starburst component\ncan not be determined from optical information alone. The optical domain is\nstrongly affected by interstellar reddening,\nand dominated by the emission of young\nstars and ionized gas all over the inner part\nof a BCD. Moreover, optical colors are not\nsensitive age indicators for stellar populations several Gyr old. For instance, for\na single stellar population, the B \u2212V and\nV \u2212R colors increase by only \u2248 0.1 mag\nwhen the age varies from 5 to 15 Gyrs (see,\ne.g., Vazdekis et al. 1996). The NIR spectral window which traces primarily the old\nstellar populations would be best suited for\nstudies focusing on the LSBC. It offers the\nfollowing advantages over the optical: i)\nthe contribution of young stars and nebular emission lines to the total light of the\ngalaxy is smaller than in the optical. The\nmodels by Kr\u00fcger, Fritze-v. Alvensleben,\n& Loose (1995) predict that a moderately\nstrong burst at its peak in luminosity accounts for only \u2248 20% of a BCD's emission\nin the K-band, compared to \u2265 80% in B.\nDealing with the BCD II Zw 40, Vanzi et\nal. (1996) found that approximately one\n\nradius (Papaderos et al. 1996b), the stellar LSBC is, together with the H I halo,\nmainly responsible for the global gravitational potential within which the starburst\nphenomenon takes place. Moreover, deep\nspectrophotometric studies of the LSBC\nare indispensable for putting constraints\non the evolutionary status and the formation history of BCDs. The comparison of\nthe properties of the LSBC (e.g., structural\nparameters, average colors and color gradients) with those of other dwarf galaxy\nclasses: dwarf irregulars (dIs), dwarf ellipticals (dEs), and low surface brightness\n(LSB) galaxies, will be crucial to test evolutionary scenarios that link those galaxies with BCDs (Thuan 1985; Davies &\nPhillipps 1988; Papaderos et al. 1996b;\nMarlowe et al. 1997; Marlowe, Meurer, &\nHeckman 1999; Cair\u00f3s 2000), or connect\nthe different morphological subclasses of\nBCDs (Noeske et al. 2000).\nA precise determination of the structural properties of the LSBC is also necessary for an elaborate study of the starforming regions of BCDs (Telles 1995;\nVanzi et al. 1996; Telles & Terlevich 1997;\nCair\u00f3s 2000; Gil de Paz et al. 2000; Doublier, Caulet, & Comte 2001; Vanzi, Hunt,\n& Thuan 2002; Papaderos et al. 2002). Recently Cair\u00f3s et al. (2002) have compared\nthe photometric parameters of the individual star-forming knots in the BCD Mrk 370\nbefore and after subtracting the contribution from the older stars, and found significant differences in the results (the LSBC\ncontribution typically shifts the starburst\ncolors by 0.2\u20130.4 mag). Evidently such a\ncorrection must be computed and applied\nbefore using the colors of the starburst\nknots to estimate their age.\n\n3\n\n\fing the distances tabulated in column 5.\nThe B magnitude of Mrk 407 has been obtained from NED.\nNIR imaging of the galaxies in J, H\nand Ks was obtained in April 2000 at the\n4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT,\nObservatorio del Roque de los Muchachos,\nORM, La Palma) during three consecutive nights. We used the infrared camera\nINGRID (Isaac Newton Group Red Imaging Device), equipped with a 1024\u00d71024\npixel Hawaii detector array. The scale was\n0.\u2032\u2032 242 pixel\u22121 and the field of view was\n4.\u2032 13 \u00d7 4.\u2032 13. We preferred to use the Ks\ninstead of the standard K filter, as the\nformer has a more favorable transmission\ncurve, which cuts off more efficiently the\nthermal emission from the telescope and\nthe atmosphere, thus reducing considerably the background noise in the final images. Throughout this work we adopt K =\nKs , which turns out to be a reasonable assumption (Persson et al. 1998; Gonz\u00e1lezP\u00e9rez, Kidger, & Martin-Luis 2001).\nDuring the first two nights of the run the\nseeing was quite stable, varying between\n0.\u2032\u2032 8 and 1.\u2032\u2032 2 FWHM, while during the third\nnight it deteriorated to values between 1\u2032\u2032\nand 1.\u2032\u2032 8.\nThe galaxies Mrk 36, II Zw 70, II Zw 71\nand Mrk 297 were also observed in April\n1999 at the Centro Astron\u00f3mico Hispano\nAlem\u00e1n (CAHA) at Calar Alto with the\n1024\u00d71024 pixel OMEGA PRIME camera,\nmounted at the 3.5m telescope.

The targets were imaged\nin the J, H and Km bands (Km is, like\nKs , a modified K filter that reduces the\nthermal background; Wainscoat & Cowie\n1992). The seeing varied between 1.\u2032\u2032 2 and\n\nhalf of the total B and V emission of\nthe star-forming regions comes from emission lines, whereas the latter contribute\nto less than 10% in the H and K bands.\nThere is also observational evidence that\nthe starburst fades away at galactocentric\ndistances smaller than in the optical (Alton et al. 1994; James 1994; Vanzi et al.\n1996; Beck, Kelly, & Lacy 1997). ii) NIR\nbroad-band colors are much less affected\nby interstellar extinction, the extinction in\nH being a factor of \u223c 6 lower than in V .\niii) A combination of optical-NIR colors\nallow, in principle, to distinguish among\nmore or less evolved populations of old\nstars (Thuan 1985; \u00d6stlin 1998; Peletier,\nValentijn, & Jameson 1990; Peletier et al.\n1999).\nConsequently, the next stage in our\nproject has been to extend our analysis\nto the NIR regime. Here we report on\ndeep surface brightness photometry in J,\nH and Ks for a sample of 9 BCD galaxies,\n8 of which have been previously analyzed\nby us in the optical (see Papers I and II).\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations, Data Reduction\nand Flux Calibration\nObservations\n\nThe basic data for the sample galaxies\nare given in Table 1. Column 5 lists the\ngalaxies distances, which were computed\nassuming a Hubble flow, with a Hubble\nconstant H0 = 75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , after correcting recession velocities relative to the\ncentroid of the local group for virgocentric\ninfall. Column 6 lists the absorption coefficient in the B band. Absolute magnitudes\n(column 7) have been obtained from the B\nasymptotic magnitudes (Cair\u00f3s 2000), us4\n\n\f2.\u2032\u2032 2 FWHM. A complete log of the observations is provided in Table 2.\n2.2.\n\nlating the flux level along neighboring lines\nand columns. Second, the sky background\nhas to be subtracted from each frame. A\ntypical NIR frame contains flux contributions from the target, from the sky background, from the warm telescope and from\ndome scattered light. Hence, it is necessary to take sky frames to measure and remove these contributions, which may fluctuate on time-scales of minutes. Depending on the size of the target, we have employed two different procedures in order\nto sample the background: 1) when dealing with small objects (optical diameter\n\u2264 30\u2032\u2032 ), we offset the telescope between exposures, producing a sequence in which the\ntarget is placed on different sections (typically the four quadrants) of the array. The\nmedian average of these frames will then\nprovide a clean sky frame (free from the\ntarget, cosmic rays and point-like sources).\nThis procedure has the benefit that all observing time is spent on the target. 2) The\nabove technique cannot be used when observing large objects which extend over a\nsignificant portion of the detector. In those\ncases, in order to obtain a clear patch of\nsky, we offset the telescope some arcmin\nfrom the target position, each time dithering by several arcsecs.\nAfterwards, the sky subtracted frames\nmust be flat-fielded. To create a proper\nflat-field, which contains only information on the overall response and pixelto-pixel sensitivity variations of the telescope/camera combination, two type of\nflat-field images are needed: the \"flat on\",\nwith a high count level, and the \"flat off\",\nwith the same duration of the \"on\" but\nwith a low count level. In the INGRID\nrun, flats were taken during twilight (\"flat\n\nData Reduction\n\nThe high sky background levels in the\nNIR (especially in H, because of OH airglow and in K, because of thermal emission from sky, telescope and dome) make\nthe observing strategy and the data reduction process more complicated than when\nobserving in the optical. The telescope\nmust chop between on-target and off-target\npositions to properly sample variations of\nthe sky-background. Additionally, the total integration time spent at each of these\npositions must be split into many subexposures of a few seconds each in order\nnot to exceed the linearity range of the detector.\nThe individual exposure times in INGRID were typically 50 s in J, 40 s in H\nand 15 s in Ks , with sets of 2\u20134 exposures\ntaken at each position. The total on-target\nintegration times are listed in Table 2. For\nthe CAHA observations, the telescope position was changed between pointings of\n60 s each, which were split up into subexposures of 6, 3 and 2 s in J, H and Km ,\nrespectively.\nThe processing and calibration of the\nframes was performed using standard procedures available in IRAF1 .\nWe first built a bad pixel mask, which\nwas applied to every raw frame. This mask\nis used to correct for bad pixels by interpo1\n\nIRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility) is\ndistributed by the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatories, operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under\ncooperative agreement with the National Science\nFoundation.\n\n5\n\n\fTable 1\nSample of Galaxies\nGalaxy\n\nOther designations\n\nR.A.

In the CAHA\nrun, the flat-fields were obtained by taking\nexposures of the dome with the lamps on\nand off. The subtraction of the dark flat\nfrom the bright one (after averaging out\nthe several individual frames) removes the\ndome, telescope and dark-current contributions, giving the final flat-field image.\nThe sky-subtracted target frame is then\ndivided by the flat-field and, finally, all\nframes in the same band are aligned,\nbrought to the same resolution by convolution with a gaussian of appropriate width,\nand combined.\nIn the case of II Zw 70 and II Zw 71,\nwe built the final frames by combination\nof the images taken at CAHA and at the\nWHT. The WHT images were resampled\nand convolved by a gaussian to match the\nsame pixel size and actual resolution of the\nCAHA frames; finally they were averaged\nweighting them by their signal-to-noise ratio.\n2.3.\n\nm\u03bb0 = m\u03bbi + a0 + a1 X,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere m\u03bb0 is the magnitude in the standard system, m\u03bbi is the instrumental magnitude, X is the airmass at which the observations were done and ai are the calibration constants to be determined.\nThe observations taken at CAHA were\ncalibrated using the INGRID frames by\nmatching the fluxes computed within a sequence of centered apertures. The magnitudes in Ks and Km were transformed following Wainscoat & Cowie (1992). Note\nthat the H and Ks INGRID images of\nMrk 36 and Mrk 297 were used only to calibrate the CAHA exposures.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nPhotometry and Morphology of\nthe Galaxies\nIsophotal magnitudes\n\nIn order to allow a direct comparison\nof our photometry with values derived in\nother studies, we list in Table 3 the isophotal magnitudes of the sample BCDs in J, H\nand Ks , as respectively determined within\nthe 23, 22 and 21 mag arcsec\u22122 isophote.\nThese magnitudes are tabulated alongside\nwith the uncertainties resulting from the\nzero-point calibration and the subtraction\nof the sky background.\nIntegrated magnitudes were corrected\nfor Galactic extinction by using the absorption coefficient in the B band (AB )\nand the color excess E(B \u2212V ) derived from\nSchlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998). The\nabsorption coefficients in the NIR bands\n(AJ , AH and AK ) are derived by assuming the standard extinction law (RV =\nAV /E(B \u2212 V ) = 3.1), and using the A\u03bb\ncurve from Cardelli, Clayton, & Mathis\n\nFlux Calibration\n\nFlux calibration was done through the\nobservation of photometric standard stars\nselected from the UKIRT list of faint IR\nstandard stars. The stars FS 17, FS 21,\nFS 27 and FS 35 were observed throughout each night at different airmasses. The\nrange of colors in the NIR is very small\nfor normal stars (particularly H \u2212K) and,\nas a consequence, accurate determination\nof the color term could not be achieved\nusing the standard list. Thus, when calculating the calibration constant and the\nmagnitudes of the galaxies, we neglect the\ncolor term and resolve the following equation:\n7\n\n\fbe only derived for the central, high intensity galaxy regions.\nThe V \u2212K color maps of the galaxies\n(B \u2212K in the case of II Zw 71) are displayed for the galaxies with the most interesting morphology in Figures 5 to 9.\nExtended dust patches are clearly visible\nin three galaxies: Mrk 33, Mrk 35 and\nMrk 297.\n\n(1989). The values of AJ for each object\nare also listed in Table 3.\n3.2.\n\nContour and Color Maps\n\nFigure 1 (top panel, on the left) show\nthe J band contour maps of the sample\ngalaxies (H band for Mrk 297). In order\nto better trace the lower surface brightness\nlevels, the outer contours were computed\nafter smoothing the original image by a\nboxcar sliding average, with a window size\nincreasing with the distance to the center\n(typically up to 7 \u00d7 7 or 9 \u00d7 9 pixels).\nWe find that the morphology of the\ngalaxies is usually very similar in the optical and in the NIR (see the atlas of B\nband contour maps in Paper I). Because of\nthe better spatial resolution in the NIR, in\nseveral cases (UM 462 being the most striking) we can resolve knots of SF which appeared blurred in the optical frames. Also,\nbecause our NIR data do not reach surface\nbrightness levels as deep as in the optical,\nsome galaxies (for instance, Mrk 36 and\nUM 462), appear slightly irregular in their\nouter part.\nUsing the NIR images, we grouped the\ngalaxies into the four different morphological classes defined in Paper II and confirm in all cases the classification previously made on optical frames.\nWe have also computed optical-NIR\ncolor maps of our sample BCDs. These\nmaps were built after the calibrated frames\nhave been aligned, brought to the same\npixel scale (the one in the frames with\nthe poorer resolution) and, finally, seeingadapted. Usually the optical-NIR color\nmaps are limited by the noise in the NIR\nframes, which is considerably higher than\nin the optical, so reliable information can\n\n3.3.\n\nSurface brightness, color and\nshape profiles\n\nFigure 1 display the surface brightness\nprofiles (SBPs) of the galaxies in the three\nNIR bands. We also present the numerical\nellipticity and position angle distribution\nin the J band as a function of the equivalent radius R, as well as color profiles (CPs)\nin the NIR. Whenever optical information\nis available, we also computed optical-NIR\nCPs.\nSBPs were built following the methods\ndescribed in Cair\u00f3s (2000) and in Paper I,\nwhich we summarize here. In the inner, irregular starburst regions, where the standard technique of fitting ellipses to the\nisophotes can not be applied, we used an\nalternative method, which does not require\nany assumption on the morphology of the\nobject.

Outside the\nstarburst-dominated regions, our sample\nBCDs present a relatively regular and symmetric morphology. We derived the luminosity and geometrical profiles by fitting\n9\n\nellipses to the isophotes, using the iraf\ntask ellipse. First we masked out foreground stars, smaller knots, and other disturbances. Then we ran the task on the\noriginal image and on images obtained by\nsmoothing the former by a median average\n(with window sizes up to 11 \u00d7 11 pixels),\nto improve the stability and reliability of\nthe results in the outer galaxian regions.\nThe final surface brightness and geometrical profiles were then built by combining\nthe profiles derived from the un-smoothed\nimage in the inner parts with those derived\nfrom the smoothed images in the outer\nparts, checking that the profiles match well\nin the overlapping radial ranges.\nThe errors of the surface brightness levels are computed as the quadratic sum,\nin intensity, of the uncertainties given by\nthe ellipse fitting algorithm and those in\nthe sky subtraction. The latter (which is\n\n\fportant than in the optical: the intensity\npeaks are less pronounced and the emission appears to be less extended (see also\nNoeske et al. 2003). For UM 462 the NIR\nprofiles are, in their inner part, markedly\nsteeper that the optical SBPs presented in\nPaper I, because of the much better resolution of the NIR data.\n\nnot to be confused with the noise of the\nsky), is an estimate of how much the sky\nlevel varies around the galaxy as a result of\nlarge- or intermediate-scale residual gradients in the sky background, imperfect flatfielding, etc.\nColor profiles have been derived by subtracting the SBPs in the two bands, after the SBPs have been brought to the\nsame resolution using gaussian smoothing and resampled to equal radial step.\nWe note that in their very center CPs can\nstill present sudden variations, as the SBP\nextraction technique employed at highsurface brightness levels where multiple\nstar-forming knots are present does not\nallow to perfectly reproduce the color variations from knot to knot. In such areas two\nirregular \"annuli\" having the same equivalent radius in the two bands may have\ndifferent shapes, so we might compare the\nsignal from physically different spatial regions. Thus color profiles are only plotted\noutside the central 1\u20132\u2032\u2032 .\nWe have found that, in agreement with\nthe optical results, one can usually distinguish on near-infrared SBPs two components: the starburst and the LSBC host\ngalaxy. This was found to be the case\nfor 8 out of the 9 sample BCDs. Only in\nMrk 407 we cannot separate the two components. However, given the faintness and\ncompactness of the galaxy, we can neither\nprove nor rule out the presence of a LSBC;\nprofiles reaching deeper surface brightness\nlevels are clearly necessary to give a firm\nanswer.\nIn all cases the SBPs have the same\nshape as the optical profiles (see Figure 1\nin Paper I); however, the contribution of\nthe starburst in the NIR is much less im-\n\n4.\n\nStructure and colors of the underlying host\n\nSurface photometry studies in the optical have clearly shown that the SBP of\nBCDs is the superposition of at least two\ncomponents: the starburst, made up of\nthe emission from young massive stars and\nfrom ionized gas, which dominates the light\nat high and intermediate intensity levels,\nand the stellar low surface brightness component, which dominates at larger radii\nand contains most of the system's stellar\nmass (Loose & Thuan 1986; Telles 1995;\nPapaderos et al. 1996a; Marlowe et al.\n1997; Doublier et al. 1997; \u00d6stlin 1998;\nDoublier, Caulet, & Comte 1999; Cair\u00f3s\net al. 2001a,b; Bergvall & \u00d6stlin 2002).\nHowever, not much in-depth work has\nbeen done so far on the properties of the\nLSBC, mainly because of two reasons:\nfirst, only recently it has been recognized\nthat its structural properties may significantly influence the global star formation\nprocess in BCDs (Papaderos et al. 1996b;\nCair\u00f3s et al. 2002) and that its morphology may hold clues to their evolutionary\nstate (\u00d6stlin, Bergvall, & R\u00f6nnback 1998;\nDoublier et al. 1997; Doublier, Caulet, &\nComte 1999; Noeske et al. 2000; Kunth\n& \u00d6stlin 2000; Cair\u00f3s et al. 2002); second, because of its faintness, a quantitative study of the LSBC (derivation of, e.g.,\n10\n\n\fscale lengths, total luminosities or color\ngradients) requires a great deal of observational and analysis effort.\nThe purpose of this section is to derive the NIR structural parameters of the\nLSBC for the observed galaxies. The\nproper determination of these parameters\nrequires some caution. In fact, in BCDs\nthe emission from the young stars and\nthe ionized gas camouflages the LSBC at\nhigh and intermediate intensity levels; it\nis, therefore, fundamental to identify and\nmeasure the size of the region contaminated by the starburst, and derive the\nstructural parameters of the LSBC outside\nthis region . Since this means to perform\nthe fit usually for \u03bcB \u2265 24 mag arcsec\u22122\n(Papaderos et al. 1996a; Bergvall & \u00d6stlin\n2002, Paper I), it is essential to achieve\ndeep surface brightness limits: the deeper\nthe data, the larger the portion of the host\ngalaxy that we can analyze, and therefore\nthe more reliable the final results. In particular, three are the main requirements:\na) Proper determination of the fit radial\nrange. Selecting the radial range of the\nSBP in which the fit is to be done is possibly the most critical point: we must make\nsure that we fit uniquely those regions of\nthe galaxy free from starburst emission. In\norder to delimit this region, we took advantage of our optical data. By inspecting the optical color maps and H\u03b1 images\nof the galaxies (Paper II), we defined an\nRtransition outside which the starburst emission is practically absent. The fit was then\ndone in the interval R > Rtransition . We notice that an examination of the SBP itself\nis not sufficient: in fact, the SBP might\nshow no discontinuity or marked change\nof slope around Rtransition , and one may be\n\ntempted to extend inwards the fit interval,\nwhich makes the derived LSB structural\nparameters significantly skewed by the inclusion of starburst light.\nb) Deep and extended surface brightness\nprofiles. To fulfill it, we observed at 4m\nclass telescopes with long exposures times,\nand did a careful flat-field correction and\nsky background subtraction, both crucial\nsteps in order to reach the required surface\nbrightness levels (27-28 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 in B, 24-25\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 in J).\nc) Use of a suitable analytical model for\nthe light distribution of the host. A third\nimportant point is the choice of the most\nappropriate formula to describe the SBP\nof the host. So far, it has been common\npractice to adopt the exponential model.\nHowever, it is nowadays recognized that\nseveral LSB host have profiles that show\nsystematic deviations from the exponential model. Here, we go further and explore the applicability of the S\u00e9rsic law in\nparametrizing the radial intensity distribution of the underlying LSBC of BCDs.\nUnderlooking or underestimating the\nimportance of the above points can lead\nto incorrect determinations of the LSB\nstructural parameters, and may explain\nthe large discrepancies among the results\nobtained in the optical bands by different authors (see the discussion inKunth\n& \u00d6stlin 2000; Cair\u00f3s 2000; Cair\u00f3s et al.\n2001a).\n4.1.\n\nExponential and S\u00e9rsic models\n\nSo far, it has been common practice\nto model the host galaxy of BCDs by fitting an exponential function to the outer\nparts of SBPs (Telles 1995; Papaderos et\nal. 1996a; Marlowe et al. 1997; \u00d6stlin 1998;\n11\n\n\fof the model and Ie denotes the intensity at\nre . The above formula includes as particular cases the exponential (n = 1) and the\nde Vaucouleurs (n = 4) laws. Caon, Capaccioli, & D'Onofrio (1993) showed that\nthe n parameter is directly correlated to\nthe size/luminosity of elliptical galaxies.\nThis finding has been extended to brightest cluster members (Graham et al. 1996),\nbulges of spirals (Andredakis, Peletier, &\nBalcells 1995) and dwarf ellipticals (Young\n& Currie 1994). A physical interpretation of the shape parameter n has been\nproposed by Trujillo, Graham, & Caon\n(2001), in the sense that a larger n corresponds to a higher central light (and possibly mass) concentration. Notably, the\nlight concentration also correlates with the\ncentral stellar velocity dispersion \u03c3 and\nwith the mass of the central super-massive\nblack-hole (Graham et al. 2001).\nIt is then natural to ask whether the\nLSBC in BCDs can be described by a\nS\u00e9rsic law too, and whether the index\nn correlates with other properties of the\nLSBC, such as total luminosity, scale\nlength or central surface brightness. Here\nwe study the shape of NIR profiles in their\nouter regions, by fitting a S\u00e9rsic law. We\nalso investigate how the resulting model\nparameters may be influenced by the precise radial range in which the profile is\nfitted and by errors in the sky subtraction.\n\nCair\u00f3s et al. 2001a).\nI(R) = I0 exp(\u2212R/\u03b1),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere I0 is the central intensity and \u03b1 is\nthe scale length. Equation 5 corresponds\nto a straight line in the R \u2212 \u03bc diagram.\nIts total magnitude, mT , is then given by:\nmT = \u03bc0 \u2212 5 log(\u03b1) \u2212 1.995. However, it is\nclear that several SBPs show a curvature\nin the R \u2212 \u03bc diagram and, thus, the derived exponential fit parameters may depend on the radial range where the fit is\ndone (see, for instance, the SBP of Mrk 370\nand Mrk 33, Figure 2, Paper I). Cair\u00f3s\n(2000) has observed a concave outer slope\nin several deep optical SBPs, and remarked\nthat in those cases, a seemingly irreproachable exponential fit to the LSBC emission\ncould just be due to fitting a small portion\nof the SBP. Conversely, in some BCDs an\ninwards extrapolation of the exponential\nslope of the LSBC implies for intermediate to small radii an intensity higher than\nthe observed value. This fact, which is suggestive of an overall convex LSBC profile,\nhas been discussed in, e.g., Papaderos et al.\n(1996a); these authors (see also Noeske et\nal. 2003) proposed a modified exponential\ndistribution flattening in its inner part to\nfit SBPs presenting the above mentioned\ncharacteristics.\nIn the last years, the S\u00e9rsic law has\ngrown in popularity as the most appropriate description of the SBP of ellipticals and\nbulges:\n\nI(r) = Ie exp(\u2212bn [(r/re )1/n \u2212 1]),\n\n4.2.\n\nOn fitting a S\u00e9rsic law to the\nSBP of the underlying host\ngalaxy\n\nAs we shall demonstrate below, fitting\nS\u00e9rsic models to the LSBC emission in\nBCDs is not as straightforward as one may\nthink, and the result may be entirely dic-\n\n(6)\n\nThe coefficient bn is chosen so that re is\nthe radius enclosing half of the total light\n12\n\n\ftated by observational uncertainties. For\nthe determination of n for a real SBP to\nbe reliable, the fitting range must be quite\nextended, spanning a surface brightness interval of at least 4 magnitudes. This is not\na problem when monocomponent galaxies are fitted, or when careful bulge-disk\ndecomposition is done in deep images2 .\nHowever, these requirements can hardly be\nmet in BCD galaxies, where, as remarked\nearlier, the emission from the old stellar\npopulation in the central regions is overwhelmed by the starburst. For instance,\nin the B band the starburst emission affects the SBPs down to typically \u03bcB & 24\nmag arcsec\u22122 (Papaderos et al. 1996a, Paper I), thus leaving only a range of at most\n3 or 4 magnitudes on which to fit a S\u00e9rsic\nmodel to the outer part of a SBP. At these\nfaint surface brightness levels, minor uncertainties in the sky subtraction or image\nflat-fielding can distort the SBP shape and\nstrongly bias the derived parameters of Eq.\n6.\nAlso, the S\u00e9rsic parameter n is poorly\nconstrained when the fit is done on such\nlimited surface brightness intervals (see\nMakino, Akiyama, & Sugimoto 1990).\nSmall variations in the fitted radial range,\nand the inclusion or exclusion of a few datapoints may change the resulting n more\nthan one would naively expect. In principle, the situation in the NIR domain\nshould be more favorable, because the starburst contaminates the light to a lesser\ndegree. However, because of the high sky\nbackground, the S/N ratio in the NIR data\nis lower than in the optical (especially in\n2\n\nK), so it is very difficult to obtain SBPs as\ndeep and extended as in the optical bands.\nBecause in several cases the BCD's profiles show a relatively smooth curvature\nover a large radius range, one is tempted\nto enlarge the fit interval by decreasing\nRtransition , at the risk of including regions\nstill affected by starburst light. In those\ncases the rms (the average scatter of the\nresiduals between observations and fit) is\nmerely a poor indicator for the validity of\nthe fit solution, as it may marginally vary\ndespite huge variations in the derived n.\nThe steeply increasing flux contribution of\nthe starburst towards small radii can indeed mimic a S\u00e9rsic profile with a higher n\n(> 4, see, e.g. the discussion in Papaderos\net al. 1996a).\n4.2.1. Illustrative examples: Mrk 33 and\nMrk 35\nIn order to illustrate the above problems, and provide some quantitative estimates of how they could affect the derived\nS\u00e9rsic parameters, we carry out a series of\nfits to the LSBC light profile of the BCDs\nMrk 33 and Mrk 35. For both we have\ndeep, good quality data. Mrk 33 exhibits\na smooth intensity decay over its whole radius range, so that one may be tempted\nto fit its SBP using a single S\u00e9rsic law.\nThe Rtransition of this system can only be\ninferred from color or H\u03b1 maps, i.e. cannot be read off its SBP. On the other hand,\nin Mrk 35 Rtransition is approximately equal\nto the radius where a sharp change in the\nSBP slope occurs, outside which the LSBC\nshows an exponential behavior.\nA typical approach to assess the uncertainties on the parameters obtained from\nfitting models to galaxy light profiles is to\n\nFor instance, in Caon, Capaccioli, & D'Onofrio\n(1993) the typical range in surface brightness was\n5\u20136 mag.\n\n13\n\n\fcreate first a 2-D galaxy images based on\nthe selected analytical formula. From it, a\nnumber of simulations are built by adding\nnoise, convolving by seeing, over or undersubtracting the sky background, etc., and\nthe light profile is then extracted and fitted; the difference between measured and\ninput parameters is recorded. From the\ndistribution of these differences the parameter uncertainty is then estimated. By\nrepeating the above procedure for many\ncombinations of input parameters, their\nuncertainties can be studied as function of,\nfor instance, the total galaxy magnitude,\nor effective radius, or profile shape, etc.\nHowever in the reality there are further and somewhat more complex source of\nuncertainties often neglected in the above\nscheme, so that these uncertainties may\nbe actually under-estimated. For instance,\nthe galaxy profile may be contaminated\nby small knots or other disturbances not\nadequately masked out before the ellipse\nfitting algorithm is run, or may be distorted by the presence of nearby bright\nstars. Also, the sky background may be\ninhomogeneous, presenting fluctuations on\nscales of the order of the galaxy size.3\nSo in the present paper we use our\nobserved data to carry out a more realistic analysis of parameter uncertainties,\nbased on comparing the parameters obtained from images taken in different bands\nand by fitting in different radial intervals.\n3\n\nDependence on the radial range\nWe fitted a S\u00e9rsic law to the SBP of Mrk 33\nand Mrk 35 in different radial intervals;\nin these and all subsequent fits, we assigned the same weight to all datapoints.\nThis is to avoid that only a few points in\nthe higher surface brightness portion of the\nprofile dominate the fit, which could be almost insensitive to the outermost profile\ndatapoints.\nThe S\u00e9rsic parameters thus obtained are\nsummarized in Table 4.\n\u2022 Mrk 33 - Optical studies (Paper\nI) show that starburst emission is\nlimited to the central 16\u2032\u2032 , so the\nJ band SBP can be safely fitted in\nthe range 20\u2032\u2032 < R < 50\u2032\u2032 , 50\u2032\u2032 being the last observed datapoint; the\nfitting range corresponds to a surface brightness interval of \u2206\u03bc = 2.4\nmag. Fitting Eq. 6 gives n = 2.09\nwith rms = 0.041. The smoothness\nand nearly constant curvature of the\nprofile tempts to enlarge the fitted\ninterval by extending it inwards to\nR = 10\u2032\u2032 (\u2206\u03bc \u223c 4 mag); this gives\nn = 4.07 and an improved rms =\n0.038. As evident from comparison\nof rows 3 and 4 in Table 4, the exclusion of one single datapoint from the\nfit can change n by nearly a factor of\ntwo.\nA similar behavior is found when fitting Eq. 6 to the Ks band profile\nusing the same starting radius (the\nKs profile is less extended). In this\ncase we obtain n = 1.29 (\u2206\u03bc =\n1.6 mag, rms = 0.048), fitting from\nR = 20.\u2032\u2032 20, and n = 5.98 fitting from\nR = 10.\u2032\u2032 48, with only a very small\n\nFor our data, seeing is not that important, as\nRtransition is generally larger than the region affected by seeing convolution.\n\n14\n\n\fTable 4\nS\u00e9rsic parameters for Mrk 33 and Mrk 35 as function of the radial range\nFit ID\n\nGalaxy\n\nBand\n\nRadial range\narcsec\n\nSurface brightness range\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nn\n\nrms\nmag\n\nre\narcsec\n\n\u03bce\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nmLSBC\nmag\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nMrk 33\n\nJ\n\n20.47\u201349.90\n10.25\u201349.90\n21.29\u201339.12\n20.47\u201339.12\n10.25\u201339.12\n20.21\u201334.84\n10.48\u201334.84\n\n21.23\u201323.68\n19.71\u201323.68\n21.40\u201322.91\n21.23\u201322.91\n19.71\u201322.91\n20.67\u201322.28\n18.98\u201322.28\n\n2.09\n4.07\n3.73\n6.98\n7.98\n1.29\n5.98\n\n0.041\n0.038\n0.030\n0.031\n0.024\n0.048\n0.052\n\n17.76\n11.87\n15.41\n09.80\n08.98\n15.78\n05.26\n\n20.99\n20.03\n20.67\n19.62\n19.42\n20.14\n17.48\n\n11.68\n11.26\n11.38\n10.98\n10.90\n11.35\n10.27\n\n(8)\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nMrk 35\n\n11.54\u201338.64\n15.45\u201338.64\n21.25\u201334.53\n12.67\u201343.70\n15.18\u201343.70\n21.95\u201334.54\n\n19.71\u201323.58\n20.32\u201323.58\n21.12\u201322.82\n19.15\u201323.12\n19.37\u201323.12\n20.19\u201322.05\n\n0.87\n0.76\n0.95\n0.84\n0.86\n0.73\n\n0.081\n0.088\n0.105\n0.069\n0.075\n0.089\n\n13.70\n14.61\n12.91\n15.10\n14.98\n15.32\n\n20.05\n20.23\n19.84\n19.43\n19.40\n19.44\n\n11.73\n11.84\n11.62\n10.92\n10.90\n10.96\n\nKs\nJ\n\nKs\n\nNote.-Columns 4, 5: radial interval and corresponding surface brightness interval for the S\u00e9rsic fit; col 6: best-fit\nshape parameter n; col 7: rms scatter of the fit; cols 8, 9: best-fit effective radius and effective surface brightness; col 10:\ntotal magnitude of the LSBC derived from the fit.\n\n15\n\n\fchange the intensity of the outermost datapoint of the SBP (\u03bcJ = 23.68 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 at\nR = 49.90\u2032\u2032 for Mrk 33 and \u03bcJ = 23.58\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 at R = 38.64\u2032\u2032 for Mrk 35) by 25%\n(\u2243 0.25 mag). The S\u00e9rsic parameters fitted to these SBPs are compared with those\nderived in the original SBP in Table 5.\nWe can see that, when the fit is not well\nconstrained, as is the case for Mrk 33, even\nmodest systematic uncertainties of \u22640.25\nmag in the outer SBP portion can change\nn by a factor of 2, and model-dependent estimates of the total magnitude by 0.3 mag.\nFor the case studied here, the re and \u03bce appear to be more stable.\nMrk 35, which shows a nearly exponential slope in its LSBC, appears to be more\nrobust against sky-subtraction errors with\nrespect to its n.\n\nincrease in the rms.\nIn Fig 2 we show three apparently\nequally good fits: (1), (2) and (5)\nfrom Table 4.\n\u2022 Mrk 35 - Mrk 35 resembles closely\nMrk 33 with respect to its LSBC\nmorphology and the radial extent\nof its star-forming component (R \u2243\n20\u2032\u2032 ). However, at variance to Mrk 33,\ndecreasing the minimum fitting radius to R \u2243 12\u2032\u2032 has nearly no effect\non the S\u00e9rsic exponent n. Fits done\nin different radial ranges and in the\nthree NIR bands all give consistent\nresults, with n \u2243 0.8\u22120.9. Thus, the\nLSBC of Mrk 35 appears to be well\ndescribed by a S\u00e9rsic law very close\nto an exponential, and whose parameters do not depend significantly on\nthe band or on the selected radial\nrange.\n\n4.2.2. Can the superposition of two different stellar populations mimic a\nS\u00e9rsic profile?\n\nSensitivity to sky subtraction errors\n\nAs seen before, good S\u00e9rsic fits can be\nobtained even when the fitted radius interval includes a significant portion of the\nstarburst component. So it is natural wondering whether the sum of two stellar populations differing in their M/L and radial\ndistribution may reproduce a S\u00e9rsic profile with an exponent n significantly larger\nthan that of its constituents. If true, this\nwould imply that a satisfactory S\u00e9rsic fit\ndoes not rule out the existence of two or\nmore distinct major stellar populations,\nand S\u00e9rsic model parameters may give a\nmisleading description of the actual photometric structure of a galaxy.\nThis in turn means that one must be\ncareful when using the exponent n from a\nfit to the whole light profile to make a com-\n\nAnother important source of uncertainties\non the S\u00e9rsic exponent n is associated with\nsky-subtraction errors, which can significantly change the SBP slope in its outermost parts. For an overestimate of the skybackground, the SBP will curve down, so\nthat the derived n will be lower, and the\ntotal magnitude of the fitted S\u00e9rsic model\nfainter and for an underestimate of the skybackground, the profile will become flatter,\nso that the fitted n will be higher and the\ntotal magnitude brighter.\nWe checked the importance of this effect on Mrk 33 and Mrk 35. We first\nrecomputed their J profiles by adding a\nconstant offset \u00b1\u2206sky to the input images. The term \u2206sky was chosen so as to\n16\n\n\fTable 5\nS\u00e9rsic parameters for Mrk 33 and Mrk 35 for an imperfectly subtracted\nsky background.\nProfile\n\noriginal\nsky under-subtracted\nsky over-subtracted\noriginal\nsky under-subtracted\nsky over-subtracted\n\nRadial range\narcsec\n\nSurface brightness range\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nn\n\nrms\nmag\n\nre\narcsec\n\n\u03bce\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nmLSBC\nmag\n\n20.47\u201349.90\n20.47\u201349.90\n20.47\u201349.90\n\nMrk 33 - J band\n21.23\u201323.68\n21.20\u201323.43\n21.26\u201324.01\n\n2.09\n3.91\n1.33\n\n0.041\n0.036\n0.048\n\n17.76\n17.23\n18.15\n\n20.99\n20.87\n21.08\n\n11.68\n11.32\n11.95\n\n15.45\u201338.64\n15.45\u201338.64\n15.45\u201338.64\n\nMrk 35 - J band\n20.32\u201323.58\n20.31\u201323.33\n20.33\u201323.91\n\n0.76\n0.88\n0.64\n\n0.088\n0.081\n0.098\n\n14.61\n14.51\n14.79\n\n20.23\n20.19\n20.28\n\n11.84\n11.74\n11.94\n\nBCD VII Zw 403. The ongoing starforming activity in this system is indicated\nby H\u03b1 emission, traceable in the inner\n& 0.5 kpc (Silich et al. 2002; Papaderos\net al. 2002). Color magnitude diagram\nHST studies (Lynds et al. 1998; SchulteLadbeck et al. 1999) and ground-based optical photometry (Papaderos et al. 2002)\nshow that the young blue stellar population is embedded into an old, more extended LSB component. Deep surface photometry down to \u03bcB \u2243 28 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 indicates that the LSB emission of VII Zw 403\ncan be well approximated by an exponential law (Papaderos et al. 2002).\nHere we have reanalyzed the B band\nprofile derived in this latter study, now\nusing a S\u00e9rsic model to fit the LSBC of\nVII Zw 403. A model with n = 0.97\nyields an excellent fit in the radius range\n36\u2032\u2032 < R < 80\u2032\u2032 ; by subtracting it from\nthe observed profile, we can recover the intensity profile of the more centrally concentrated starburst population, which in\n\nparative analysis of the structure of different classes of galaxies or of galaxies at\ndifferent redshifts. For instance, assume\nfor sake of discussion n = 3: this could\nbe just a normal bulge, or a galaxy actually formed by starburst and a host component whose cumulative light distribution\nmimics well a S\u00e9rsic profile. The presence\nof two distinct components may go undetected because of poor resolution, faintness, or just because a very large sample\nis being analyzed in some automated way,\nand no visual inspection of each object is\ndone. A similar effect has been observed by\nBalcells, Graham, Dom\u0131\u0301nguez-Palmero, &\nPeletier (2003): \"fits to ground-based profiles reach S\u00e9rsic indices n > 4 because the\nlight from HST-unresolved central sources,\nplus in some instances nuclear disks or\nbars, when convolved with typical groundbased seeing, link smoothly with the extended bulge profile and mimic higher n\nS\u00e9rsic profiles\".\nA real-life example is offered by the\n17\n\n\fquality of the fit, one of the authors selected the radial interval upon inspection\nof the color and H\u03b1 maps, and of the SBP\n(in order to exclude those outermost datapoints with large error bars and obviously\ndeviating from the profile's general trend);\nanother author ran the fitting algorithm\nwithin the prescribed radius intervals.\nThe results are listed in Table 6; a quick\ninspection does confirm that S\u00e9rsic fits to\nthe SBP can in some cases give very different parameters in the three bands, n varying for a single object by up to one dex\n(Mrk 36). Solutions with S\u00e9rsic exponents\nn & 15 are omitted, because such fits fail to\nproduce meaningful results, a general fact\nalready noted by Graham et al. (1996).\nThese uncertainties in the derived S\u00e9rsic\nparameters propagate into large uncertainties in the model-dependent total magnitudes (mLSBC ) of the LSBC. As a result,\nthe integral color derived for the underlying host galaxy from subtraction of the\nmLSBC in different bands can in many cases\nbe incompatible with the observed ones\n(those derived directly from the CP, see\nnext section), and cannot be accounted for\nby any stellar population (e.g. Mrk 33\nwith (J \u2212 H)LSB = \u22120.23 together with\n(J \u2212 Ks )LSB =0.20).\nDue to the failure of the S\u00e9rsic law to\nproduce robust and self-consistent models\nfor a large fraction of the available SBPs,\nit appears worthwhile to check whether a\nfixed n = 1 (exponential model) allows for\nmore a stable approximation to the LSBC.\nWe start off by repeating the test already done for the S\u00e9rsic law for Mrk 33,\nthat is, we fit again its J and Ks SBP\nwithin the same radius intervals, this time\nafter fixing n = 1. The results, listed in\n\nturn is well fitted by another S\u00e9rsic function with n = 0.86. The inner luminosity\ncomponent is due to a young stellar population as indicated by its blue optical colors\n(Lynds et al. 1998; Papaderos et al. 2002).\nHence, the observed SBP of VII Zw 403 is\nwell described by the superposition of two\nnearly exponential profiles (bottom panel\nin Fig 3), each representing a very different stellar population with respect to age\nand M/L.\nNotwithstanding this fact, if our light\nprofile were truncated at \u03bcB . 26.3\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 (R \u2243 50\u2032\u2032 ), a single S\u00e9rsic model\nwith n = 3.40 would successfully fit the observed SBP in the range 5\u2032\u2032 < R < 50\u2032\u2032 (upper panel in Fig 3). So, if somebody were\ndealing with less deep profiles and lacking\nadditional information on the galaxy, such\nas color maps or narrow-band images, they\nwould perhaps conclude that this galaxy\nhas just a single component with a S\u00e9rsic\nindex n \u223c 3.5.\nThis underlines once more the necessity\nfor examining all available observational\nevidence (morphology, color profiles, ionized gas distribution, etc.) prior to profile\nfitting and decomposition, as well as the\ncrucial importance of deep surface photometry studies for obtaining an unbiased description of the underlying host galaxy of\nBCDs.\n4.3.\n\nDeriving the photometric parameters\n\nTaking the above remarks into account,\nwe proceeded to fit S\u00e9rsic models to the\nSBP of the galaxies in our sample. To minimize the risk that the choice of the fitted\nintervals were influenced by a subjective\njudgment or expectation on the results and\n18\n\n\fTable 6\nS\u00e9rsic photometric parameters for the LSB host galaxy\nGalaxy\n\nBand\n\nMrk 33\n\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\nJ\nH\nKs\n\nMrk 35\n\nMrk 36\n\nUM 462\n\nII Zw 70\n\nII Zw 71\n\nI Zw 123\n\nMrk 297\n\nRadial range\narcsec\n\nSurface brightness range\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nn\n\nre\narcsec\n\n\u03bce\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nmLSBC\nmag\n\n16.89\u201342.57\n16.26\u201322.83\n16.09\u201329.89\n21.25\u201334.53\n21.30\u201342.88\n21.95\u201343.70\n07.44\u201311.30\n07.55\u201312.37\n07.86\u201311.34\n08.63\u201321.40\n08.04\u201321.52\n08.16\u201311.73\n10.04\u201325.77\n10.17\u201322.31\n09.88\u201322.52\n18.55\u201327.51\n18.74\u201327.26\n16.11\u201327.07\n08.34\u201311.06\n07.68\u201309.58\n06.30\u201309.17\n20.42\u201334.31\n20.36\u201329.29\n18.70\u201326.84\n\n20.84\u201323.23\n20.38\u201321.33\n20.13\u201321.77\n21.12\u201322.82\n20.49\u201323.30\n20.19\u201323.12\n21.46\u201322.77\n21.17\u201322.50\n20.98\u201322.03\n20.86\u201323.12\n20.23\u201322.59\n19.98\u201320.65\n21.57\u201324.76\n21.19\u201323.83\n20.88\u201323.82\n21.71\u201322.94\n21.34\u201322.71\n20.82\u201322.36\n21.57\u201322.46\n20.73\u201321.45\n19.95\u201321.45\n21.45\u201324.10\n21.29\u201323.30\n20.41\u201322.52\n\n2.88\n0.90\n1.38\n0.97\n0.80\n1.01\n9.46\n0.74\n1.73\n1.20\n1.50\n0.57\n2.30\n2.19\n1.35\n0.70\n0.34\n0.46\n> 15\n> 15\n0.29\n> 15\n2.94\n> 15\n\n15.34\n13.44\n15.06\n12.72\n15.88\n13.33\n0.37\n7.34\n4.67\n8.63\n9.02\n8.90\n5.09\n5.38\n6.57\n14.77\n15.36\n15.41\n***\n***\n5.11\n***\n1.37\n***\n\n20.64\n20.01\n20.03\n19.80\n19.91\n19.03\n13.95\n21.14\n19.78\n20.82\n20.39\n20.12\n19.98\n19.72\n20.07\n21.27\n21.02\n20.79\n***\n***\n19.67\n***\n12.21\n***\n\n11.49\n11.72\n11.29\n11.59\n11.31\n10.70\n12.25\n14.26\n13.46\n13.35\n12.72\n12.94\n13.34\n12.98\n13.14\n12.89\n12.89\n12.52\n***\n***\n14.01\n***\n08.31\n***\n\n19\n\n\fplayed in Table 9.\nTo obtain an estimate of the ages of LSBCs, we compared their colors with the\npredictions of the GALEV spectrophotometric evolutionary synthesis models\n(Schulz et al. 2002, Anders, Bicker &\nFritze-v.Alvensleben, priv. comm.). An\ninitial mass function with a Salpeter slope\nand lower and upper cutoff masses of 0.08\nand 100 M\u2299 was chosen.\nFigure 4 displays the (V \u2212J)\u2013(J \u2212H)\ndiagram for the LSBC of the sample galaxies, together with the tracks of the models for an instantaneous burst (IB) with\nmetallicities Z = 0.02 Z\u2299 and Z = 0.4 Z\u2299 ,\nas well as for a continuous star-formation\n(CSF) rate with the same metallicities.\nMost of the galaxies seem to present colors compatible with the models predictions. In the IB approximation, the ages\nof the LSBC are estimated to be & 3 Gyr,\nwhereas, as expected, ages are larger in the\nCSF approximation.\nTwo of the objects, Mrk 33 and Mrk 297,\nwhich happen to be the most luminous\ngalaxies in the sample, lie far off the model\ntracks. A detailed study of the evolutionary status and stellar composition of these\nBCDs is outside the scope of the present\npaper. In fact a proper characterization of\ntheir stellar population, done by combining multiband images and spectra, will be\nthe subject of the next paper in this series.\n\nTable 7, show that exponential fits give parameters consistent in the different bands,\nand are not that sensitive to the selected\nradial range (provided it does not include\nthe starburst), nor to sky-subtraction errors, as compared with S\u00e9rsic models.\nThe fitted parameters to the LSBC of\nall sample galaxies using an exponential\nmodel are listed in Table 8. At variance to\nwhat we found for the S\u00e9rsic models, the\nintegral colors of the LSBC, as obtained\nfrom exponential fits, are consistent within\nthe errors with the colors derived directly\nfrom color profiles.\nWe note that this improvement in the\nstability of the fit results is due to having\nset n equal to a constant (thus removing\none degree of freedom in the S\u00e9rsic law),\nnot to some particular property of the exponential model. Indeed, fixing any other\nvalue within reasonable intervals, would\ngive comparable improvements in the fit\nstability.\n4.4.\n\nColors of the underlying stellar host galaxies and age estimation\n\nUpon inspection of the CPs in Figure 1\nwe see that the galaxies present constant\ncolors in their outer regions, in agreement\nwith the results found in the optical (Papers I and II). The good quality of our\ndata allowed us to derive reliable colors\nfor the LSBC of the BCDs. They have\nbeen computed by averaging the color profiles over a radial range which excludes\nthe starburst-dominated regions (i.e., for\nR \u2265 Rtransition ) and those outermost datapoints having large error bars. The resulting values, corrected from Galactic extinction as described in Section 3.1, are dis-\n\n5.\n\nComments on the Individual Galaxies\n\nMrk 33. - Mrk 33 is a luminous\nBCD with a regular appearance, belonging to the Type I (nuclear starburst) BCD\nclass introduced in Paper II; the star20\n\n\fTable 7\nMrk 33: parameters for the exponential model\nFit ID\n\nBand\n\nRadial range\narcsec\n\nSurface brightness range\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nrms\nmag\n\n\u03b1\narcsec\n\n\u03bc0\nmag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032\n\nmLSBC\nmag\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nJ\n\n20.47\u201349.90\n10.25\u201349.90\n21.29\u201339.12\n20.47\u201339.12\n10.25\u201339.12\n20.47\u201349.90\n20.47\u201349.90\n20.21\u201334.84\n10.48\u201334.84\n\n21.23\u201323.68\n19.71\u201323.68\n21.40\u201322.91\n21.23\u201322.91\n19.71\u201322.91\n21.20\u201323.43\n21.26\u201324.01\n20.67\u201322.28\n18.98\u201322.28\n\n0.061\n0.180\n0.040\n0.047\n0.144\n0.069\n0.053\n0.049\n0.124\n\n13.44\n11.16\n12.88\n12.63\n09.98\n14.75\n12.06\n10.06\n08.65\n\n19.72\n19.12\n19.63\n19.58\n18.89\n19.86\n19.53\n18.50\n18.02\n\n12.07\n11.87\n12.08\n12.07\n11.89\n12.01\n12.12\n11.48\n11.32\n\nJ, sky under-subtracted\nJ, sky over-subtracted\nKs\n\nNote.-For the exponential law there is a direct relation between the effective parameters re and \u03bce and the scale\nfactors \u03b1 and \u03bc0 : \u03b1 = 0.596 Re and \u03bc0 = \u03bce \u2212 1.822\n\nstars continuously, but at a lower rate, during the last 15 Gyr.

The brighter starforming regions are placed in the central\npart of the galaxy, and form a \"heartshaped\" structure; a tail departs from it to\nthe south-west, connecting with two moderately bright knots \u223c20\u2032\u2032 further away.\nWe have labeled the knots resolved in the\nbroad-band frames following Mazzarella &\nBoroson (1993) (see Figure 1). Steel et al.\n(1996) reported the presence of Wolf-Rayet\nstars in the knot a, and inferred for it an\nage younger than 5 Myr.\nThe morphology in the optical and\nNIR broad-band frames is similar. Optical frames present more distorted inner\nisophotes, which point to the presence of\n\nmel & Bender 1992; Paper II), is confirmed\nby our color maps: a conspicuous red patch\nis seen at the south-east of the galaxy center. Interestingly, the bluest regions do not\ncoincide with the brightest (central) knot,\nas it was found to be the case in optical\ncolor maps, but appear displaced to the\nsouth.\nWe have performed aperture photometry centered on the red peak, within a circular aperture of radius 2\u2032\u2032 , and determined\nits colors: V \u2212J = 2.18, V \u2212H = 2.74,\nV \u2212K = 3.00, J \u2212H = 0.56, H \u2212K =\n0.26. Such optical-NIR colors, which are\neven redder than those in the LSB component (see Table 9), can naturally be explained by dust extinction. This is also\nsupported by recent interferometric 12 CO\nstudies of Mrk 33 revealing a morphologically and kinematically complex molecular gas distribution in its inner part, also\npointing to a high, non-uniform absorption\n(Fritz 2000).\n23\n\n\fVanzi, Hunt, & Thuan (2002) have recently published NIR spectra and images\nof this galaxy. In Figure 1 we labeled the\nstar-forming knots following the notation\nused by the above authors, who identified\nthem with SSCs. Photometry within apertures of 2\u2032\u2032 in radius is listed in Table 10.\nThese values have been corrected only for\nGalactic extinction; no corrections have\nbeen made for the ionized gas contribution\nnor for the contribution of the underlying\nLSBC. Our results are in fair agreement\nwith the values published by Vanzi, Hunt,\n& Thuan (2002).\nII Zw 70. - This is a Type I (nuclear\nstarburst) galaxy, which forms together\nwith II Zw 71 a pair of interacting galaxies (Vorontsov-Vel'Yaminov 1977). Evidence for an ongoing interaction between\nboth systems is presented by interferometric H I studies (Balkowski, Chamaraux,\n& Weliachew 1978; Cox et al. 2001). A\nconspicuous central star-forming region is\nplaced in the center of a markedly elongated LSBC, with a nearly constant ellipticity of \u2248 0.7. An extended, extraordinarily faint (\u03bcB & 27 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 ) stellar\nplume emerging from the star-forming region and protruding \u223c1.\u2032 7 to the direction\nof II Zw 71 has been recently discovered on\ndeep optical images (Papaderos et al. 2001;\nCair\u00f3s et al. 2003). It apparently coincides\nwith the massive H I stream connecting\nII Zw 70 with II Zw 71; its relatively blue\noptical colors are consistent with the hypothesis that it has recently formed within\nthe gaseous bridge between the BCDs. The\nV \u2212K color map of II Zw 70 is shown in\nFigure 7.\nII Zw 71. -This galaxy belongs to the\nType III (chain starburst) morphological\n\ndust. Interestingly, the central knot, b, coincides with the intensity peak in the NIR,\nwhereas knot a is identifiable with the optical maximum. The intensity ratio between\nknots a and b decreases when moving from\nthe U to the Ks band. A similar behavior\nhas been reported so far only in the BCD\nMrk 178 by Noeske et al. (2003).\nFigure 6 displays the V \u2212K color map\nof Mrk 35, which reveals a very intriguing morphology: a dust lane is crossing the\ncenter of the galaxy in the north-south direction, bending eastwards to the south.\nThe a knot has blue colors, while the inner\nknots b and c are very red.\nMrk 36. - It is a typical compact, lowluminosity and low-metallicity BCD, classified as Type I (nuclear starburst). Starforming activity takes place in the inner\nregions of a roughly elliptical LSBC with\nredder colors. It have been shown (Paper II), from high-resolution ground-based\noptical imagery, that star formation occurs\nin at least five compact (diameter. 200\npc) Super-Star Cluster (SSC) candidates\nspread over the inner region of the galaxy.\nThis finding is confirmed by our infrared\ndata. The ages of these star-forming knots,\nderived from optical colors, range between\n2.5 and 5 Myr (Mas-Hesse & Kunth 1999;\nCair\u00f3s 2000).\nUM 462.\n- This is another lowluminosity, low-metallicity system, with\n12 + log(O/H) = 7.95 \u00b1 0.01 (Izotov &\nThuan 1999). It falls into the Type II (extended starburst) morphological class. It\nexhibits an intriguing morphology in its\nstar-forming region, which is resolved into\nsix knots. These features were not detected\nin our previous optical data (Paper I) due\nto poor seeing conditions.\n24\n\n\fTable 10\nColors of star-forming knots in UM 462\nKnot\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nJ \u2212H\n(mag)\n\nH \u2212K\n(mag)\n\n0.34\n0.44\n0.39\n0.43\n0.48\n0.43\n\n0.43\n0.29\n0.35\n0.29\n0.25\n0.29\n\nH\u03b1 frames (Noeske et al. 2001), so they\nare most likely background objects.\nMrk 297. - This object (Type II: extended starburst), originally discussed in\nthe Thuan & Martin (1981) list and included in several subsequent studies of\nBCDs, strictly speaking should not be regarded as a dwarf galaxy (MB = \u221220.54,\nPaper II). Alloin & Duflot (1979) classified it as a merging system. Indeed, the\ngalaxy is very distorted and shows in its\nLSBC filamentary north-south extensions,\nsuggestive of an ongoing merger event.\nMrk 297 presents a very intriguing morphology. Its intensity distribution peaks\nin the center of the galaxy. Smaller knots\nform a chain aligned in the east-west direction. The H\u03b1 maps (see Paper II) show\nthat the SF is taking place in numerous regions spread over nearly the entire galaxy.\nGround-based V \u2212K (see Figure 9) and\nHST V \u2212R color maps (Papaderos 1998)\nclearly indicate a large-scale, inhomogeneous absorption pattern in the galaxy .\nMrk 407. - It is a very compact and\nfaint Type I BCD. It presents an overall regular morphology, though its outer\n\nclass. The interpretation of II Zw 71 as\na (possible) polar ring galaxy (Whitmore\net al. 1990) has recently received further\nobservational support through the analysis by Cox et al. (2001). Its LSBC presents\nred colors and elliptical isophotes, however\nthe chain of star-forming regions, aligned\nperpendicular to the major axis of the\nLSBC, results in an overall distorted morphology. The B \u2212K color map of this system is shown in Figure 8.\nI Zw 123. - It is a small and compact Type I class BCD, with a metallicity of Z\u2299 /7 (Izotov, Thuan, & Lipovetsky 1997). It presents a regular morphology, with its star formation occurring\natop the central part of a roughly circular LSB envelope, whose ellipticity is about\n0.1. This central star-forming region is resolved into two smaller knots. Knot a is\nslightly displaced from the center of the\nouter isophotes and shows a slight northwest elongation; a seems to be connected\nby a \"bridge-structure\" with the southern\nknot b. Feather-like extensions can be seen\nto the northeast and southwest; they show\nvery red colors, and are not detected in\n\n25\n\n\fbe carried out on accurate SBPs derived\nfrom deep multiwavelength data; this will\nbe done in a forthcoming paper.\nThe first and immediate conclusion we\ncan draw from this analysis is that one\nshould exercise extreme caution when fitting the S\u00e9rsic law in BCDs and, even\nmore importantly, when fitted parameters are discussed in the context of the\nphysical state of the stellar LSBC component or the dark matter distribution of\na BCD. We suspect that the problems so\nfar discussed are the reason for the surprisingly high S\u00e9rsic exponents derived by\nBergvall & \u00d6stlin (2002) for the LSBC\nof BCDs: in four of the six galaxies they\nstudied they infer a n > 17 (see their Table\n5). It is hardly imaginable that such values, exceeding even those found among the\nbrightest elliptical galaxies (Graham et al.\n1996), are witnessing a particular type of\ndynamical equilibrium of the visible and\ndark matter in BCDs (see discussion in\nBergvall & \u00d6stlin 2002).\nWe would like to highlight some results\nthat have emerged from the present study.\nFirst, in some galaxies the profile of the\nLSBC presents a clear curvature in the\nR \u2212 \u03bc diagram (Mrk 33 and II Zw 70), and\nthe exponential law gives a poor fit to their\nSBP; in other BCDs (Mrk 35 and UM 462),\nhowever, the LSBC seems to be well fit\nby the exponential law. This variation in\nthe profile shape might indicate that the\nstructure of the LSBC is not the same in\nall BCDs, a result already suggested by\nthe findings of previous work (Loose &\nThuan 1986; Kunth, Maurogordato, & Vigroux 1988; Kunth & \u00d6stlin 2000; Noeske\net al. 2000; Cair\u00f3s 2000; Cair\u00f3s et al. 2002;\nBergvall & \u00d6stlin 2002).\n\nisophotes are slightly perturbed and elongated along the northwest\u2013southeast direction. The quality of the NIR images does\nnot permit to tell whether or not an older\nstellar LSBC is underlying its star-forming\nregions.\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom the results of the fits listed in Table 6, it is evident that the S\u00e9rsic law,\nwhile allowing for a more precise description of the intensity distribution of many\nLSBCs, still has serious drawbacks, such\nas the sensitivity of the model parameters\nto the fitted radial range. Furthermore, in\nseveral cases the derived S\u00e9rsic indices for\nthe same galaxy may be quite different in\nvarious passbands. Given that color gradients within the LSBC of evolved BCDS\nare small, we would expect to obtain similar S\u00e9rsic solutions regardless of the passband.\nOnly in two of the nine sample BCDs,\nnamely Mrk 35 and II Zw 70, the fit is\nreasonably good and stable. For UM 462\nthe fits in J and H are in agreement; the\ndiscrepant parameters obtained for Ks are\nprobably due to the poorer quality of the\ndata.\nWhat does all this mean? Should we\nprincipally discard the S\u00e9rsic law as a\nphysically meaningful representation of the\nSBPs of the host galaxy of BCDs, and\nhence look for alternative fitting formulas?\nOr, more simply, are observational uncertainties/limitations of the data responsible\nfor the failure of the S\u00e9rsic law to provide\nan effective description of the photometric\nstructure of the LSBC? At this stage an\nanswer to the above questions is premature. A more comprehensive analysis must\n26\n\n\fBCD studies. This should be taken into\naccount, especially when interpreting ages\nof BCDs using color-magnitude diagrams.\n\nTherefore, the \"so called\" BCD are objects with an active starburst which dominates their optical properties, but when\nthe characteristic of LSBC are taken into\naccount, they seems to constitute an heterogeneous class of galaxies.\nSecond, it is clear that an incorrect\nmodeling of the underlying stellar component would yield a misleading physical description not only for the LSB component\nitself, but also for the superposed starburst component. We see comparing the\nresults from Tables 6 and 8 that fitting\ndifferent models to the LSBC one obtains\ntotal LSBC luminosities differing by several tenths of a magnitude (see for instance\nMrk 33 in J). Therefore, as pointed out\nin Cair\u00f3s et al. (2002) and Papaderos et\nal. (2002), a proper modeling of the radial intensity distribution of the LSBC is\nessential for an accurate derivation of the\nstar formation history within the starburst\ncomponent.\nIn the 8 galaxies in which a LSBC has\nbeen identified, the colors of the latter suggest old ages. However, two of the galaxies,\nMrk 33 and Mrk 297, show colors which\nplace them in a different part of the twocolor diagram (Fig. 4), far from the region\npopulated by other BCDs and described\nby simple star formation histories. These\ntwo galaxies are the two most luminous in\nthe sample; according to a strict classification criterion, they should not be considered dwarf, but belong to the class of\nLuminous Blue Compact Galaxies (LBCG)\n(\u00d6stlin 1998, Paper II).\nFinally, the fact that we found inhomogeneous, large-scale dust absorption in\nthree of the nine galaxies challenges the belief that dust is generally of no concern in\n\n7.\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\nThis is the third of a series of papers devoted to a multiwavelength study\nof a large sample of BCD galaxies. In\nthe first two papers we presented optical\nbroad- and narrow-band observations of\nthe galaxy sample. Here we have extended\nour dataset with broad-band J, H and Ks\nNIR images for 9 BCDs. We have derived\ncontour maps in the J band, as well as\nsurface brightness and color profiles. We\nhave also shown optical-NIR color maps\nfor several objects.\nThe main results of our work can be\nsummarized as follows:\n\u2022 The galaxies present very similar\nmorphologies in the NIR and in the\noptical. The presence of two distinct\ncomponents, already seen in previous\noptical studies, is also discernible in\nthe NIR surface brightness profiles in\nall but one case (Mrk 407): a young\nstarburst population, dominating\nthe inner regions, is superposed on\nthe host galaxy, detectable at faint\nsurface brightness levels (typically\n\u03bc & 21 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 in J). The host\ngalaxy exhibits in its outer regions\nquite regular elliptical isophotes and\nnearly constant red colors, indicative\nof an evolved stellar population. In\nMrk 407, the present data do not\nallow to verify the presence of an\nold underlying low-surface brightness\ncomponent (LSBC).\n\u2022 We have checked whether a S\u00e9rsic\n27\n\n\fWe have argued that an exponential\nmodel, while it may not be a universal descriptor of the intensity distribution of the LSBC, it nonetheless appears to be considerably more\nstable against the above mentioned\nproblems. Therefore it can provide,\nat this stage, a more reliable tool to\nquantify the structural parameters of\nthe LSBC and compare them with\nthose of other nearby dwarf classes,\nas well as with star-forming galaxies\nat a larger redshift.\n\nfit to the outer part of SBPs can be\nused to parametrize the structural\nproperties of the underlying LSBC.\nAt least two of the sample BCDs\n(namely, Mrk 33 and II Zw 70),\nshow a clear curvature in their profiles in the R \u2212 \u03bc diagram, suggesting a best-fitting S\u00e9rsic exponent\nn > 1, whereas in two other galaxies (Mrk 35 and UM 462) the LSBC\nprofiles are consistent with an exponential law (n = 1). We have\ndiscussed at length the problems\nemerging from profile fitting using\nthe S\u00e9rsic law, and shown that the\nusable surface brightness interval of\nthe available SBPs does generally not\nallow to tightly constrain the S\u00e9rsic\nparameters. The latter were found\nto be very sensitive to the fitted radial range and to uncertainties in the\nsky subtraction.\n\n\u2022 Optical-NIR color maps indicate a\nlarge-scale inhomogeneous absorption in three of the sample galaxies.\n\nBased on observations with the WHT\noperated on the island of La Palma by\nthe Royal Greenwich Observatory in the\nSpanish Observatorio del Roque de los\nMuchachos of the Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica\nde Canarias and on observations taken at\nthe German-Spanish Astronomical Center,\nCalar Alto, Spain, operated by the MaxPlanck-Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie (MPIA),\nHeidelberg, jointly with the spanish \"Comision Nacional de Astronomia\".

M.\nCair\u00f3s acknowledges support by the EC\n\nIn addition we found that a good\nS\u00e9rsic profile is not an unambiguous proof of a monocomponent stellar system; we demonstrate that such\na profile can be produced by the superposition of a young stellar component on an old, more extended\nLSBC with an exponential profile.\nWe emphasize that one must not underestimate the various sources of\nuncertainties affecting S\u00e9rsic fits to\ncomposite and in many respects very\ncomplex extragalactic systems, such\nas BCDs. We therefore recommend\nagainst just using the apparently excellent quality of S\u00e9rsic fits to a wide\nrange of observed surface brightness\ndistributions to derive astrophysical\nresults or inferences.\n28\n\n\fgrant HPMF-CT-2000-00774.

The contours are spaced by 0.5 mag.\nThe surface brightness level corresponding to the outermost contour and the spatial scale are\nshown in each panel. North is up and East to the left. Top-right panel: Surface brightness\nprofiles; R is the equivalent radius. Bottom-left panel: Position angle and ellipticity profiles\n(empty circles mean that the ellipse fitting algorithm fails to compute the isophote's P.A. and\nellipticity, and adopts instead the last measured value). Bottom-right panel: Color profiles.\n\n33\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n34\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n35\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n36\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n37\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n38\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n39\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n40\n\n\fFig. 1.- Continued\n\n41\n\n\fFig. 2.- Three examples of a S\u00e9rsic fit to the J-band light profile of Mrk 33 are shown.\nFilled symbols identify the radial interval over which the profile was fitted; stars mark the\neffective radius and effective surface brightness. The middle profile is shifted up by 1 mag,\nthe upper profile by 2 mags. Notice how all fits appear to be equally good (rms is . 0.04\nmags). See text and Table 4 for further details.\n\n42\n\n\f43\nFig. 3.- Upper panel: the B-band light profile of VII Zw 403, plotted down to \u03bcB \u2243\n26.3mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 , shows a relatively smooth curvature, and can be best fit, in the range 5\u2032\u2032 <\nR < 50\u2032\u2032 , by a S\u00e9rsic law with n = 3.40. Lower panel: A deeper light profile, reaching down\n\n\fFig. 4.- V \u2212J vs J \u2212H diagram for the LSBC of the sample galaxies. We also plot the\nevolutionary tracks of metallicity z = 0.0004 and z = 0.008 for an instantaneous burst (IB,\nleft panel) and for continuous star formation (CFS, right panel). The arrow in the left panel\nindicates the shift in the plot due to an extinction of 0.5 V magnitudes, while the cross in\nthe right panel shows the typical uncertainty.\n\n44\n\n\fFig. 5.- V \u2212K color map of Mrk 33 overlaid with the B-band isophotes.
