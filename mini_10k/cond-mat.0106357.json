M. Suslov\nP.L.Kapitza Institute for Physical problems\n117334, Moscow, Russia\nE-mail: suslov@kapitza.ras.ru\n\nAbstract\nAnswer to cond-mat/0106005, cond-mat/0106006 and additional notes are\ngiven concerning my previous comment (cond-mat/0105325).\n\nRecently I have discussed the numerical results for the Anderson transition [1]. Objections [2] and [3] have appeared after that. We answer here to the arguments of [2, 3] and\ngive the additional comments.\n1. I did not state in [1] that \u03bd = 1 (in fact, my most probable value was 1.25). I tried\nto show that a problem exists: numerical results contradict to all other information on the\ncritical exponents. It is not my personal problem, and it is not my personal affair to solve\nit. Indeed, a value \u03bd \u2248 1 is desirable from viewpoint of this other information and I tried\nto understand, is not it possible to agree it with the raw numerical data by the change of\ninterpretation and by more realistic estimation of errors. I found it possible for the data\nthat I considered as the best. May be I was a little wrong in the latter estimation.\nAuthors of [2] argue that I used the systems of too small size (283 ), \"while currently\nsizes \u223c 503 (for ELS) and 182 \u00d7 108 (for TM) are standard\" 1 . A size 182 \u00d7 108 should kick a\nman out his feet, while authors of [2] know perfectly well that only the minimal length scale\n(L = 18) is relevant. In fact, such systems are small. 2 I do not know about \"currently\"\nand \"standard\" but only one result is cited in [2] for systems \u223c 503 [6]. With my procedure\nused, authors of [2] obtained this result with uncertanty \u03bd = 1.25 \u00f7 1.75, which is not\ndrastically different from uncertainty 0.8 \u00f7 1.7 that I have derived from Zharekeshev and\nKramer data [7]. So, it is admitted that the largest scale data give uncertainty 1.25 \u00f7 1.75\nand not 1% [5]. At the present stage, I am quite satisfied with such progress.\n1\n\nAbbreviations of [2]: TM and ELS - transfer matrix and energy level statistics methods, FSS -\nfinite size scaling.\n2\nI can understand such trick in the text, where authors of [2] are in the course of discussion, but the\nsame thing is present in the figure capture: \"the system sizes of TM data are larger than for ELS data\".\n\n1\n\n\f2. Authors of [2] claim, that my procedure is not interesting because it does not give\nincrease of accuracy. They are mistaken here: I had not purpose to increase accuracy. I\nwanted to dig out the real uncertainty of results. According to [2], estimation of error\ngiven by my procedure approximately corresponds to a scattering of results due to different\nauthors. So this estimation is reliable and reasonably conservative. I can hardly dream of\nthis. By the way, only \"people with experience in FSS\" can believe in accuracy of several\npercents, looking at Fig. 1 of [2].\nIn fact, authors of [2] have overlooked the essense of my suggestions. I have introduced\nsome function f (L), in order to have a convinient languige for discussion of scaling corrections. My suggestions are simple. Show your function f (L), so that we can have a look at\nit. Then it will be evident, has this function so good power-law behavior as you say, or not.\nIt will be clear, is there change of the effective \u03bd with the length scale, or not. Then we can\ncompare such functions for different quantities and different models, in order to estimate a\nsystematic error. Then we can see, how this error change with L and so on.\nI do not insist, that my procedure for determination of the function f (L) is the best. In\nfact, it is useful in the case of rather poor raw data. If these data are sufficiently detailed\nand accurate, it is more preferable to extract the function f (L) by direct linearization (in\nfact, it was admitted in [1]). Such procedure was used in a number of papers and I have no\npriority in it. But it was only recently, that explicit plots of such functions have appeared\n[8, 9].\n3. I agree with [3], that in the general case a fixed point depends on L and irrelevant\nparameters are uncritical. The fixed point \u03bc\u2217 has a regular dependence in a/L and the\nmain correction is the ordinary surface effect. With this dependence taken into account,\nmy Eq.(5) takes a form\nQ(\u03bc) = F {\u03bc\u2217 (L/a), A1 (\u03c4 )sy1 , A2 (\u03c4 )sy2 , A3 (\u03c4 )sy3 , . . .} ,\n\n(5\u2032 )\n\nPutting A1 (\u03c4 ) = b1 \u03c4 , Ai (\u03c4 ) = ci + bi \u03c4 (i \u2265 2), we have instead (6)\nQ(\u03c4, L) = F {a/L, b1 \u03c4 (L/a)y1 , (c2 + b2 \u03c4 )(L/a)y2 , (c3 + b3 \u03c4 )(L/a)y3 , . . .} ,\n\n(6\u2032 )\n\nFor L \u226b a we have instead (7) and (8) correspondingly\nQ(\u03c4, L) = [F {0, 0, 0, 0, . . .} + B0 (a/L) + B2 (L/a)y2 + B3 (L/a)y3 , . . .] +\n+\u03c4 [C1 (L/a)y1 + C2 (L/a)y2 + C3 (L/a)y3 , . . .] \u2261 F0 (L/a) + \u03c4 f (L/a) ,\n\n\u03c4 (L/a)y1 \u226a 1\n(7\u2032 )\n\nand\nQ(\u03c4, L) \u2248 F {0, b1 \u03c4 (L/a)y1 , 0, 0, . . .} \u2261 G {\u03c4 (L/a)y1 } ,\n\n\u03c4 (L/a)y1 >\n\u223c1 .\n\nCorrection to the critical point\n\u03c4\u0303 = \u03c4 + \u2206(a/L) ,\n\n\u2206(a/L) = [F0 (L/a) \u2212 F0 (0)] /f (L/a)\n2\n\n(8\u2032 )\n\n\fis essential for small \u03c4 in Eq.(7\u2032 ) but is irrelevant in Eq.(8\u2032 ). So unification (7\u2032 ) and (8\u2032 )\nhas a form:\nQ(\u03c4, L) = G {\u03c4\u0303 f (L/a)} .\n(9\u2032 )\nOne should shift the curves for different L, so as they have a common intersection point,\nand use the same procedure as in [1]. Such shift is routinely used in the most of papers.\nThere was no need in it for the data of [7].\nFor d = 4 \u2212 \u01eb the first irrelevant exponent y2 is of the order of \u01eb [10] and linearization\nin the parameter c2 (L/a)y2 is invalid for L <\n\u223c L0 \u223c a exp{const/\u01eb}. The corresponding\ndependence on L is inessential in the restricted intervals of L but there is a slow drift of\nresults on the large scale L0 . May be, it is a clue to the whole problem.\n4. There are a lot of vague speculations in [3] concerning a number of nonlinear parameters. Authors were able to calculate that in my procedure this number is even greater\nthan in their one. In spite of these speculations, it it evident to anyone that\n(a) all steps of my procedure are well defined and unambiguous.\n(b) authors of [3] did not give a clear answer to a clear question: how do they avoid\nambiguity of their procedure?\nWith modifications of [3], my procedure becomes ambiguious too. There is no sense to\ndiscuss the results of the unclear procedure.\n5. One can carry out a very simple experiment. Take some function, f.e. f (x) =\nx /(1 + x), add some noise to it, and try to find its asymptotic behavior Ax\u03b1 at x \u2192 \u221e,\nusing only values of f (x) for x = 1, 2, . . . , 20. You will find it rather difficult to formulate\na procedure that gives the reliable and reasonably conservative estimation of errors. The\nmore or less successful procedure is as follows. Take an interval (xmin , 20) and increase\nxmin until a simplest fit log f (x) = C + \u03b1 log x give for \u03c72 its normal value \u2248 n, where\nn is a number of points 3 . It is a necessary condition for a systematic error to be of the\norder of a statistical one. Now increase xmin a little more: then the formal statistical\nerror will give more or less reasonable estimation of the real error. A little more is rather\nsubjective and depends on the degree of conservatism. This procedure is successful, if a\nnoise is uncorrelated and you have reliable estimation of its amplitude. In the general case\nsuch procedure is minimal and gives only the lower bound of the error. In my experience,\nrelated with a paper [11] and its development [12], the noise was strongly correlated and\na formal statistical error was typically two orders less than a real one (even for the good\nvalues of \u03c72 ). I can only wonder that some people are so confident in their accuracy.\nThe given example is simple, because corrections to asymptotics are regular. You can\nincrease accuracy of \u03b1 by many orders, fitting log f (x) as C0 + \u03b1 log x + C1 /x + C2 /x2 + . . .\n(this fit is linear and, consequently, unique). It is not the case that is interesting for us.\nIf a structure of corrections is power-like but unknown, you should use a nonlinear fit\nf (x) = Ax\u03b1 + A1 x\u03b11 + A2 x\u03b12 + . . . and you immediately meet with a problem of many\nminima. Their origin is rather simple. Take an arbitrary succession \u03b1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 . . . (such\n2\n\n3\n\nWe suppose that this number is much greater than a number of parameters.\n\n3\n\n\fthat \u03b1 > \u03b11 > \u03b12 > . . .) and use for f (x) a linear fit Ax\u03b1 + A1 x\u03b11 + A2 x\u03b12 + . . . (only\nA, A1 , A2 , . . . are changed). It will be successful with sufficient number of terms and \u03c72\ntakes its normal value. Take this result as \"a zero approximation\" and use the general\nnonlinear fit (not only A, A1 , A2 , . . . but also \u03b1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . are changed). The quantity \u03c72\ncannot be essentially lower than its normal value, and can change only slightly. So, there\nis a local minimum for it, close to \"a zero approximation\". Taking different successions\n\u03b1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 . . ., you can generate a great number of such minima. A value of \u03b1 is different in\ndifferent successions. So you can obtain an arbitrary result for it 4 by such procedure.\nI think, it is clear now, why one should not believe in any results obtained with such\nfits. If a structure of corrections is unknown, one hardly can invent something better than\nthe simplest procedure given in beginning of this section.\n6. After [1] I had a constructive discussion with P. Marko\u0161 5 and now I have better\nunderstanding of a general situation. Here are my impressions of it.\n(i) There is a good paper [9], where the transfer-matrix method and the system sizes\nup to L = 24 were used. The raw data are rather detailed and accurate, so a function f (L)\ncan be obtained with good accuracy 6 by direct linearization of W -dependence. More than\nthat, Fig. 2 of this paper shows a number of such functions (in the log\u2013log coordinates)\nfor the different Lyapunov exponents. Some observations can be made in this figure. For\nL<\n\u223c 10 the slopes of the curves differ very strongly and correspond to values of \u03bd in the\ninterval 0.8 \u00f7 1.5. For L >\n\u223c 10 practically all curves change their slopes and the more or less\nunique slope (with \u03bd \u2248 1.5) arises. Nevertheless, the curve for the least exponent z1 (which,\naccording to [9], should reach its asymptotics most quickly) has a tendency to change its\nslope in the opposite direction. For L > 12, this slope is compatible with a value \u03bd = 1.25,\nif a point for L = 24 (evident outliar) is excluded. One can see, that a possible change of\nthe effective \u03bd with L is not a fantasy.\n(ii) There is a lot of high precision results for L <\n\u223c 15 and they indeed give a value\n\u03bd \u2248 1.5. Let us assume, that this value is not true, but effective. Then it should change\nwith increase of L. In practice, one can double [7, 9] or triple [6] this size, though there are\nnot many such attempts. With such increase of L, a situation cannot improve drastically.\nOne can be able only to see some change of \u03bd with L. There is a number of reasons, why\nthis change could not be observed reliably:\n(a) Accuracy of the raw date is worse by an order of magnitude for L >\n\u223c 15.\n(b) A need for a careful treatment was underestimated. The researches were satisfied\nthat the large scale data roughly correspond to well-established results for small L, though\nthe most of fits are not satisfactory.\n(c) When linearization of W -dependence was used, the interval of linearization was kept\nfixed. It gives the wrong tendency due to increase of nonlinear effects for the large L (see\n4\n\nIt is restricted only by the assumptions made.\nHe has no responsibility for my conclusions.\n6\nI think, this accuracy is a little exaggerated. One can see in Fig. 2 of [9] that a number of points\ndeviates from the general smooth dependence in a quantity that is not controlled by the given error.\n5\n\n4\n\n\ffootnote 5 in [1]). This tendency is not large in magnitude, but the whole situation is\nrather unstable. One can see in Fig. 2 of [9] that a shift of the large L data in one standard\ndeviation produces essential change of results.\nAs a consequence, the large L data appeared to be practically useless. In fact, this\nconclusion is supported by authors of [2], who refer primarily to results for small and not\nfor large L.\n(iii) If the raw data have a quality comparable with [9], the adequate procedure should\ncontain, in our opinion, the following stages:\n(a) In order to have the efficient use of the \u03c72 procedure, the statisical uncertainties of\nthe raw data are not simply estimated, but are calculated independently for each point in\nthe course of some formal procedure. Probably, it can be done with the use of different\nrealizations of a random potential.\n(b) The function f (L) is obtained by linearization of W -dependence. The interval of\nlinearization is adjusted in accordance with \u03c72 and the error is properly estimated. It\nshould be done independently for each L, but with the use of the same routine. More\nconservatism is desirable at this stage.\n(c) The function f (L) is plotted. It is fitted by the power law dependence in the interval\n(Lmin , Lmax ) where Lmin is adjusted with the use of \u03c72 and Lmax is the largest L that is\npossible to reach. Minimization of \u03c72 is a clever procedure and it provides a necessary compromise between the high accuracy data for small L and the poor accuracy data for large L:\nthe latter are properly weighted, but all useful information is extracted of them. Adjustment of Lmin allows to exclude the main body of a systematic error, which is contained in\nthe small L data. Excess of conservatism at the stage (b) is partially compensated, because\nsmaller Lmin becomes admittable.\n(d) The rest of a systematic error can be controlled by comparison of results for different\nquantities and different models.\nI have impression, that nobody had used this procedure in a full extent 7 .\n(iv) Some comments concerning the 4D case. The most advanced results are those of\nZharekeshev and Kramer [8]. With \u03bd = 1, they have a parameter \u03c4 (L/a)1/\u03bd (in designations\nof [1]) of the order unity, and a condition for linearization of W -dependence is marginally\nfulfilled. With \u03bd = 1/2 (as it should be), the above parameter is \u223c 10 and they are deeply\nin the nonlinear regime. So, a possibility \u03bd = 1/2, in fact, was not tested numerically.\nSome confirmation of these arguments can be found in [14]. Fig. 1,a of this paper shows\nW -dependences for another quantity (Lyapunov exponent, but not level statisics) which\nare essentially more detailed in comparison with [8]. Indeed, they are strikingly nonlinear.\nMore attention should be given to investigation of these nonlinearities.\nThis work was financially supported by INTAS (Grant 99-1070) and RFBR (00-0217129).\n7\n\nSensitibility of results to restriction of the intervals in W and L was observed by MacKinnon[13].\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] I.
