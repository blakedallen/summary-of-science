INTRODUCTION\n\nDiscretizations are used in general relativity mainly in three contexts: a) numerical relativity, b) canonical quantum\ngravity, c) path integral quantum gravity. In the first context the aim of discretizing the equations is to solve them on\na computer numerically. In the second and third contexts the primary goal is to make finite the infinite dimensional\ncomputations implied by the field theory nature of general relativity (and eventually to solve the theory numerically\non a computer). It has long been known in numerical relativity that the set of algebraic equations that results of\ndiscretizing the Einstein equations (for instance, with externally prescribed lapse and shift) is inconsistent in the\nfollowing sense. The discretized evolution equations produce solutions in the future that do not satisfy the discretized\nconstraints, even if one started from initial data that satisfied them. The general attitude towards this problem in\nnumerical relativity has been that the aim is to provide an approximate description of the continuum theory and\ntherefore the inconsistency is accepted as part of the errors of the approximation scheme. This was clearly discussed\nby Choptuik [1], who showed that the constraints were preserved at the same order of discretization as the evolution\nequations.\nIn canonical and path integral quantum gravity, the potential inconsistency of the discretized theories has not\nreceived a lot of emphasis. It was noted by Bander [2] in general and later by Friedman and Jack [3] in the context\nof Regge Calculus that it was not straightforward to find consistent Hamiltonian formulations of general relativity\ndiscretized in space and with continuum time. It has generally been recognized that a problem has to arise in lattice\ntreatments of general relativity since, unlike the case of Yang\u2013Mills theory, the introduction of a lattice breaks the\n\"gauge symmetry\" of the theory (invariance under diffeomorphisms). In spite of these observations, the remarkable\nformulation of a well defined Hamiltonian constraint for quantum general relativity due to Thiemann [4] starts with\na discretization of the theory. Thiemann promotes the Hamiltonian constraint to a quantum operator acting on\nthe space of solutions of the diffeomorphism constraint. This somewhat obscures the issue of the implementation of\nthe constraint algebra, since on such space the algebra of constraints is Abelian. It has been noted, however, that\nit is likely that problems are implicit in the quantization with respect to the closure of the constraint algebra [5]\n\"off-shell\" (on non-diffeomorphism invariant states). Proposals to construct quantizations of the Hamiltonian that\nproduce non-Abelian operators have failed to yield quantities that reproduce the proper constraint algebra [6,7].\nIn canonical formulations, the role of the constraints is to generate infinitesimal symmetries. In a discrete theory, the\nbest we could hope for is that the constraints generate some finite version of the symmetry in question. Obviously, such\nan action cannot be achieved with a discretization of the continuum constraints, since the latter generate infinitesimal\nsymmetries. The continuum constraints therefore naturally structure themselves into algebras. The discrete generators\nof symmetries that one could have in a discrete theory will not structure themselves in an algebra. Therefore there\n1\n\n\fis no sense in which one will have in the discrete theory an algebra of constraints that \"in the limit\" reproduces the\ncontinuum algebra.\nAn additional element is that discrete symmetries are not characterized by free parameters, as infinitesimal symmetries are. A discrete transformation can only admit a set of fixed values for the parameters of the transformation.\nTherefore in dealing with finite symmetries the finite quantities that are remnants of the Lagrange multipliers of the\ncontinuum theory become fixed. This inevitably leads us to systems of constraints of second class in the canonical\ntreatment.\nFinally, one has a choice as to the role of time. One could try to discretize \"space\" and leave \"time\" continuous.\nThis is highly unnatural in general relativity and might further complicate the issues of the constraint algebra since\nthe latter mixes symmetries in space and time. In this paper we will choose to pick a discrete time in the theories we\nconsider. This is more symmetric and allows for a better connection with \"spin-foam\" approaches in which time is\ndiscrete.\nHaving a discrete canonical formulation for general relativity is, in our opinion, fundamental at the time of understanding current \"spin-foam\" approaches to the path integral of quantum general relativity. It is well known that\npath integrals for gauge field theories should be evaluated with care in order to avoid integrating over the orbits of the\ngauge groups. This is at the core of the Fadeev\u2013Popov technique and can only be fully understood if one understands\nthe degrees of freedom of the theory at a Hamiltonian level [8]. To achieve this for discrete gravity is one of the goals\nwe are pursuing.\nAn additional point to consider is that most lattice treatments of gauge theories require an Euclidean rotation in\norder to be well defined. This is expected to be problematic in the case of general relativity. The formalism we will\npresent in this paper does not require an Euclidean rotation and operates directly in terms of the Lorentzian signature\ntheory. The lack of a Lorentzian formulation on the lattice has been recognized as one of the major unsolved issues\nin lattice formulations of gravity [9]\nThe inconsistencies that arise in discretizations are present in spin foam approaches directly. When one discretizes\nthe action in order to compute the path integral one is left with a discrete action whose equations of motion are\nseldom analyzed and in general yield an inconsistent theory. If one therefore computes the integral for the discrete\ntheory, one is attempting a functional integration for a theory that does not exist. One will get a result, but there\nwill generically be no way of making a connection with the underlying classical theory.\nA point to consider is if one could not simply adopt in the quantum context the same attitude as was adopted in\nnumerical relativity. Could one deal with inconsistent discrete theories that are just approximations of a consistent\ntheory that exists in the limit? This would be a point of view that is tenable if one had a well defined way of taking\nthe limit in which discretizations are infinitely refined. This is not currently available for general relativity and it is\ngenerally thought that such limit will be highly non-trivial given the non-renormalizability of the theory. Current\nthinking favors viewing the discrete theory as existing at a fundamental level and never taking the limit (see for\ninstance [10]. In such a case one needs to take the issue of consistency of such a theory seriously. Even if one wished\nto consider some sort of \"continuum limit\" (for instance summing over all possible discretizations), it is our belief\nthat one has a better chance of defining such a limit if one is obtaining it in a process where one considers a sequence\nof well defined, consistent, theories.\nIn this paper we would like to discuss the canonical treatment of discrete systems. The subject is quite non-trivial.\nUp to this paper the state of the art of the subject was such that even the treatment of simple mechanical systems\nwith constraints was incomplete. In particular, the literature only covers systems with constraints that are holonomic\n(function of half of the variables of the phase space). In this paper we extend the canonical formulation to include\narbitrary constrained mechanical systems. A key new ingredient is to introduce a symplectic structure on the lattice\nbased on discrete canonical transformations that implement the discrete time evolution. We then turn our attention to\nthe treatment of gauge field theories on the lattice. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a complete canonical\nanalysis of gauge field theories discretized on the lattice is presented, in the sense that we discretize the action of the\ntheory and derive the canonical theory from the discrete action. The final results for Maxwell and Yang\u2013Mills theories\non the lattice coincides with the traditional transfer matrix methods, but the intermediate steps are quite non-trivial.\nWe also present a canonical treatment of BF theory on the lattice. In this case, up to present no lattice treatment\nwas present at all in the literature. The formulation we construct is readily applicable to the case of general relativity,\nwhich we will discuss in a separate publication.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section II we discuss the quantization of mechanical systems with discrete\ntime evolution. In section III we extend the analysis to lattice Yang\u2013Mills theory. In section IV we discuss discretized\nBF theory. We end with a discussion of implications for quantum gravity.\n\n2\n\n\fII. MECHANICS WITH DISCRETE TIME\nA. Summary of previous results\n\nSome of the difficulties of constructing Hamiltonian formulations for discrete theories can be illustrated with the\nsimplest mechanical systems if we assume time is a discrete variable. The subject of \"discrete mechanics\" has been\nconsidered several times in the literature. The broad subject of \"symplectic integrators\" also touches upon these issues.\nHowever, all discussions we have found in the literature refer to systems with holonomic constraints, for reasons that\nwill soon become apparent [11]. Here we will present a a discussion that includes anholonomic constraints, as the\nones in gravity.\nDiscretizing time in mechanics immediately leads to difficulties with conservation laws. Let us start by considering\nthe action of a particle of unit mass in a potential, written in a discrete approximation in which time is split into\nintervals of duration \u01eb,\nS=\n\nN\nX\ni=1\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\npi (qi+1 \u2212 qi ) + pi 2 /2 + V (qi ) \u01eb.\n\n(1)\n\nIf we work out the equations of motion of this action, one gets,\nqi+1 \u2212 qi = \u01ebpi ,\n\npi \u2212 pi\u22121 = \u2212V \u2032 (qi )\u01eb.\n\n(2)\n\nOne immediately recognizes a discrete approximation to Hamilton's equation. There is an asymmetry in the equations\nin the sense that the discretization of the time derivative of q is \"centered\" between i and i + 1 whereas the one in\np is centered between i \u2212 1 and i. This theory recovers in the continuum limit the usual classical mechanics of a\nparticle in a potential. However, it is well known that in the discrete theory, energy is not conserved. It is immediate\nto realize that similar problems will arise in constrained systems: the discrete evolution equations will fail to preserve\nthe constraints, at least if they are anholonomic.\nA first attempt to solve the problem of non-conservation is due to T.D. Lee [12]. His proposal consists in \"parameterizing\" the system by including the time interval as a new variable. The action can therefore be written\nas,\nX\nS=\npn (qn+1 \u2212 qn ) \u2212 H(pn , qn )(tn+1 \u2212 tn )\n(3)\nn\n\nand we consider as variables pi , qi and ti . When one varies with respect to ti one immediately gets that H(pi , qi ) =\nH(pi\u22121 , qi\u22121 ). This equation, with the two other equations of motion determine qi , pi and ti , that is, the time interval\nis now determined by the equations of motion.\nT.D. Lee's construction merits several comments. First, notice that the use of the parameterization immediately\nsuggests how to handle the problem of non preservation of constraints in general relativity. The idea is to consider\nthe Einstein evolution equations together with the constraints as equations for the metric, extrinsic curvature and\nthe Lagrange multipliers (the lapse and shift). One has therefore four additional equations (the constraints) and four\nadditional variables. One can therefore construct a discrete system of equations that preserves the constraints in\ntime. We are currently studying the feasibility of implementing this scheme in a numerical simulation of spherically\nsymmetric space-times.\nThere has been considerable discussion in the literature on constructing quantities that are kept invariant by the\nevolution implied by the discretized evolution equations. Maeda [13] constructed a modified Noether theorem. Logan\n[14] proposed a method for constructing invariants not associated with symmetries of the action. Jaroszkiewicz and\nNorton [15] discussed the quantization of systems by constructing evolution operators.\nA whole separate chapter could be devoted to the subject of \"symplectic integrators\" [16]. The focus of this area of\nresearch is usually numerical. People have noticed for a long time that it is desirable for discretization of dynamical\nequations to preserve certain conserved quantities of the classical theory. In particular the symplectic structure, or,\nas in the case of celestial dynamics, angular momentum and energy [17]. This is a highly developed area of research,\nin which canonical techniques have been widely used in the treatment of discrete systems. In fact, our current paper\ncan be viewed as an extension of certain symplectic integration results to the realm of constrained systems, with an\neye towards application to general relativity.\n\n3\n\n\fB. Canonical formulation and quantization of simple discrete mechanical systems\n\nThe classical canonical treatment of discrete systems has been considered in the literature (see for instance [17]). The\nusual treatment considers unconstrained systems and implements time evolution through canonical transformations\nof type 2 [18]. The discrete evolution produces time histories of the variables. In the continuum limit, some of these\nevolutions (the ones with good continuum limit) will be solutions of the continuum equations of motion. Since we are\ninterested in constrained systems, we will find that it is more convenient to work with canonical transformations of\ntype 1.\nWe start by denoting L\u0302(q, q\u0307) the Lagrangian of the continuum theory. We discretize time in equal intervals tn+1 \u2212\ntn = \u03b5 and we label the generalized coordinates evaluated at time tn as qn . We define the \"discretized\" Lagrangian\nas,\nL(n, n + 1) \u2261 L(qn , qn+1 ) \u2261 \u03b5L\u0302(q, q\u0307)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\nq = qn\n\nand\n\nq\u0307 \u2261\n\nqn+1 \u2212 qn\n.\n\u03b5\n\n(5)\n\nThe action can then be written as,\nS=\n\nN\nX\n\nL(qn , qn+1 )\n\n(6)\n\nn=0\n\nand its Lagrange equations of motion,\n\u2202L(qn\u22121 , qn ) \u2202L(qn , qn+1 )\n\u2202S\n=\n+\n= 0.\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn\n\n(7)\n\nAs can be seen, in the discrete theory the Lagrangian is not a function of the manifold of q's and its tangent bundle\nq\u0307, but it is a function of qn at the n \u2212 th level and of qn+1 at the next level (or equivalently qn and qn\u22121 ).\nWe now wish to introduce canonically conjugate momenta and show how the discrete evolution can be represented\nas a canonical transformation in phase space. The partial derivatives of L and L\u0302 are related by,\n\u2202 L\u0302\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n=\n\u2202qn+1\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\n(8)\n\n\u2202 L\u0302 \u2202 L\u0302\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n=\u03b5\n\u2212\n\u2202qn\n\u2202q\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\n(9)\n\nIn the continuum, the momentum canonically conjugate to q is defined as\np=\n\n\u2202 L\u0302\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\n(10)\n\nand due to (8) we define the canonically conjugate momentum in the discrete theory as\npn+1 =\n\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n.\n\u2202qn+1\n\n(11)\n\nThe Lagrange equations in the continuum can be written as,\ndp\n\u2202 L\u0302\n=\ndt\n\u2202q\n\n(12)\n\nwith p defined as in (10). To discretize this last expression we make the substitution\n\u1e57 \u2192\n\npn+1 \u2212 pn\n\u03b5\n\nand use (8), (9) and (11) to get\n4\n\n(13)\n\n\f\"\n#\n\u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\npn+1 \u2212 pn\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n1 \u2202L(n, n + 1) \u2202L(n, n + 1)\n1\n\u2202 L\u0302\n1 \u2202 L\u0302 \u2202L(n, n + 1)\npn+1 +\n=\n=\n,\n+\n=\n=\n+\n\u03b5\n\u2202q\n\u03b5 \u2202 q\u0307\n\u2202qn\n\u03b5\n\u2202qn+1\n\u2202qn\n\u03b5\n\u2202qn\nThen\npn = \u2212\n\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n.\n\u2202qn\n\n(14)\n\nSummarizing, the discrete Lagrange equations are,\npn+1 =\n\n\u2202L(qn , qn+1 )\n\u2202qn+1\n\n,\n\npn = \u2212\n\n\u2202L(qn , qn+1 )\n.\n\u2202qn\n\n(15)\n\nAnd it should be noted that these equations define a type 1 canonical transformation from the variables (qn , pn ) to\n(qn+1 , pn+1 ).\nThe variables (qn , pn ) constitute a phase space and as usual, if the system of equations (15) is non-singular one\ncan introduce new coordinates (qn+1 , pn+1 ) for the phase space. This transformation is canonical, in the sense that it\npreserves the symplectic structure,\n{qn , pn } = {qn+1 , pn+1 } = 1.\n\n(16)\n\nThe generating function (we use the terminology of [19]) for the transformation is F (qn , pn ) = \u2212L(qn , qn+1 (qn , pn )),\nwhere qn+1 (qn , pn ) is given by inverting the first of (15); it is immediate to check that it satisfies the equations of a\ngenerating function,\n\u2202F\n\u2202qn+1\n= pn \u2212\npn+1\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn+1\n\u2202F\n=\u2212\npn+1 .\n\u2202pn\n\u2202pn\n\n(17)\n(18)\n\nOne can now introduce the generating functions of canonical transformations of the various types that correspond to\ndiscrete time evolution. If the variables (qn , qn+1 ) are used for coordinates of the phase space, then one can introduce\na generating function of type 1,\nF1 (qn , qn+1 ) \u2261 \u2212L(qn , qn+1 )\n\u2202F1\n= {F1 , pn }\npn =\n\u2202qn\n\u2202F1\npn+1 = \u2212\n= \u2212 {F1 , pn+1 } .\n\u2202qn+1\n\n(19)\n(20)\n(21)\n\nIt is then possible to define generating functions of type 2,3 and 4. For instance, if the phase space is coordinatized\nby (qn , pn+1 ), solving the first of (15) for qn+1 one can introduce a generating function of type 2,\nF2 (qn , pn+1 ) \u2261 qn+1 pn+1 \u2212 L(qn , qn+1 ),\n\u2202F2\npn =\n= {F2 , pn } ,\n\u2202qn\n\u2202F2\nqn+1 =\n= \u2212 {F2 , qn+1 } .\n\u2202pn+1\n\n(22)\n(23)\n(24)\n\nTo facilitate the comparison with the continuum limit case, we can introduce a function H(pn+1 , qn ) given by,\nF2 (qn , pn+1 ) = pn+1 qn + H(pn+1 , qn ),\n\n(25)\n\nsuch that one recovers the discrete Hamilton equations,\n\u2202H\n\u2202pn+1\n\u2202H\n.\npn = pn+1 +\n\u2202qn\n\nqn+1 = qn +\n\n5\n\n(26)\n(27)\n\n\fThe quantization of these finite canonical systems is achieved by representing the finite canonical transformations\nthat materialize the time evolution as unitary operators. We illustrate this with a simple example, a particle in a\npotential. The Lagrangian is given by\nL(qn , qn+1 ) = m\n\n(qn+1 \u2212 qn )2\n\u2212 V (qn )\u01eb\n2\u01eb\n\n(28)\n\nthe canonical momentum is given by pn+1 = m(qn+1 \u2212 qn )/\u01eb, from which we can get qn+1 = pn+1 \u01eb/m + qn . The\ngenerating function is given by,\nF2 = pn+1 qn +\n\np2n+1\n\u01eb + V (qn+1 )\u01eb = pn+1 qn + H(pn+1 , qn ),\n2m\n\n(29)\n\nand the equations of motion (taking into account (23,24)) are\npn+1\n\u01eb\nm\npn = pn+1 + V \u2032 (qn )\u01eb\n\nqn+1 = qn +\n\n(30)\n(31)\n\nwhich can be solved for pn+1 as,\npn\n\u01eb2\n\u01eb \u2212 V \u2032 (qn )\nm\nm\n= pn \u2212 V \u2032 (qn )\u01eb.\n\nqn+1 = qn +\n\n(32)\n\npn+1\n\n(33)\n\nWe now proceed to quantize the system. We choose a polarization such that the wavefunctions are functions of\nthe configuration variables, \u03a8(qn+1 ). The canonical operators have the usual form. The evolution of the system is\nimplemented via a unitary transformation. An immediate computation shows that the operator that implements the\ntransformation pn+1 = U pn U \u2020 , qn+1 = U qn U \u2020 is given by,\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 \u0013\n\u0012\np \u01eb\nV (qn )\u01eb\nexp i n\n.\n(34)\nU = exp i\nh\u0304\n2mh\u0304\nAt a quantum mechanical level the energy H 0 (qn+1 , pn+1 ) is not conserved, as we expected from the fact that it\nwas not conserved classically. It is remarkable however, that one can construct an \"energy\" (both at a quantum\nmechanical and classical level) that is conserved by the discrete evolution. To construct this energy we use the\nBaker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nexp (X) exp (Y ) = exp X + Y + [X, Y ] +\n([X, [X, Y ]] + [Y, [Y, X]]) + . . . ,\n(35)\n2\n12\n\u0001\n\u0001\n0\n2\nand one can therefore write U = exp i\u01eb\nh\u0304 Heff (qi , pi ) where Heff = H (q, p) + O \u01eb , which is immediately conserved\nunder evolution. It is straightforward to write down a classical counterpart of this expression.\nC. Canonical formulation and quantization of constrained discrete mechanical systems\n\nWe now extend the analysis of the previous subsection to the case of a constrained system. Here it will become\nclear the advantage of using canonical transformations of type 1. We start with an action written in first order form,\nL(n, n + 1) = pn (qn+1 \u2212 qn ) \u2212 \u01ebH(qn , pn ) \u2212 \u03bbnB \u03c6B (qn , pn )\n\n(36)\n\nwhere we assume we have M constraints B = 1 . . . M .\nWe now exhibit the construction of a type 1 canonical transformation. We construct the appropriate canonically\nconjugate momenta using the first of (15),\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n= pn\n\u2202qn+1\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n=0\n=\n\u2202pn+1\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n= 0.\n=\n\u2202\u03bb(n+1)B\n\nq\nPn+1\n=\n\n(37)\n\np\nPn+1\n\n(38)\n\n\u03bbB\nPn+1\n\n6\n\n(39)\n\n\fTo determine the equations of motion for the system we start from the second set of equations (15),\n\u2202\u03c6B (qn , pn )\n\u2202H(qn , pn )\n\u2202L(n, n + 1)\n= pn + \u01eb\n+ \u03bbnB\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn\n\u2202\u03c6B (qn , pn )\n\u2202H(q\n,\np\n)\n\u2202L(n,\nn\n+\n1)\nn n\n= \u2212(qn+1 \u2212 qn ) + \u01eb\n+ \u03bbnB\nPnp = \u2212\n\u2202pn\n\u2202pn\n\u2202pn\nPn\u03bbB = \u03c6B (qn , pn ).\nPnq = \u2212\n\n(40)\n(41)\n(42)\n\nCombining the last two sets of equations we get the equations of motion for the system,\n\u2202H(qn , pn )\n\u2202\u03c6B (qn , pn )\n\u2212 \u03bbnB\n\u2202qn\n\u2202qn\nB\n\u2202\u03c6 (qn , pn )\n\u2202H(qn , pn )\n+ \u03bbnB\nqn+1 \u2212 qn = \u01eb\n\u2202pn\n\u2202pn\nB\n\u03c6 (qn , pn ) = 0.\npn \u2212 pn\u22121 = \u2212\u01eb\n\n(43)\n(44)\n(45)\n\nSuperficially, these equations appear entirely equivalent to the continuum ones. However, they hide the fact that in\nq\norder for the constraints to be preserved, the Lagrange multipliers get fixed. Another way to see it, is that Pn+1\n= pn\nand therefore it is immediate that the Poisson bracket of the constraints evaluated at n and at n + 1 is non-vanishing.\nWe then consider the constraint equation (45) and substitute pn by (37),\nq\n\u03c6B (qn , Pn+1\n) = 0.\n\n(46)\n\nWe then solve (44) for qn and substitute it in the previous equation, one gets,\nq\n\u03c6B (qn+1 , Pn+1\n, \u03bbnB ) = 0,\n\n(47)\n\nand this constitutes a system of equations. Generically, these will determine\nq\n\u03bbnB = \u03bbnB (qn+1 , Pn+1\n, v\u03b1 )\n\n(48)\n\nwhere the v \u03b1 are a set of free parameters that may arise if the system of equations is undetermined. The eventual\npresence of these parameters will signify that the resulting theory still has a genuine gauge freedom represented by\nfreely specifiable Lagrange multipliers.\nThe final set of evolution equations for the system is therefore given by (43,44) where the Lagrange multipliers are\nsubstituted using (48).\nAt this point it is worthwhile discussing the physical meaning of the determination of the value of the Lagrange\nmultipliers. This is an issue that is potentially confusing. Lagrange multipliers are normally associated with gauge\nsymmetries. The fixation of the value of the Lagrange multipliers seems to suggest that the constructive procedure of\nthe discrete theory somehow has selected a preferred gauge for us. A priori this might appear very unnatural. How\ncould the procedure know which gauge to choose? A point to emphasize is that in this section we have absorbed in the\ndefinition of the Lagrange multipliers a factor of \u01eb (the evolution parameter interval) when we replaced the integral\nof the action by a discrete sum. What gets determined is therefore \"\u03bb \u00d7 \u01eb\". For a completely parameterized theory,\nsince there is no explicit reference to \u01eb, one can choose it arbitrarily and therefore redefine the value of the multiplier\narbitrarily. A different way of putting this, which might help later understand the situation in general relativity, is to\nconsider that once the lattice has been established, the gauge is fixed, but one has still the freedom of where to place\nthe lattice in an arbitrary manner.\nIII. YANG\u2013MILLS AND MAXWELL THEORIES ON A DISCRETE SPACE-TIME\n\nHaving set up the canonical quantization of mechanical systems discretized in time, we now turn our attention to\nfield theories. In this case we also wish to discretize space. Although the words \"Hamiltonian formulation\" are used\nfrequently in the lattice context, the formulation is not constructed in the traditional canonical sense. A popular way\nof obtaining a Hamiltonian operator for quantized lattice gauge theory is the \"transfer matrix\" method. This consists\nin discretizing the space-time action and reading off from the path integral the operator that would correspond to the\ninfinitesimal evolution operator in the limit in which the spacing in time goes to zero. There is no construction of a\nclassical discrete theory that is later quantized. Even the definition of canonical variables for such a classical theory\n7\n\n\fis problematic and has received some attention [20]. What we will do in this paper is precisely that: we will construct\na classical canonical discrete lattice theory for Yang\u2013Mills, that we will quantize and we will show that we recover the\nsame results as those of the usual transfer matrix approach.\nWe will first explore the construction of Yang\u2013Mills lattice theory with a continuum time parameter. Although we\nknow that ultimately this is not what we want, since as we argued it is unlikely a formulation like this will be useful in\nthe gravitational case, it will prove instructive for later constructing a theory discretized in space and time. We will\nthen consider the quantization of Maxwell theory on a discrete space-time. Maxwell's theory has all the ingredients\nof interest and is simpler than Yang\u2013Mills theory.\nA. Discrete lattice Yang\u2013Mills with continuum time\n\nWe consider a hypercubic lattice in four dimensions with spatial spacing a and spacing in time a0 . We label the\nvertices of the hypercube with an integer i. Each link connecting two sites is identified as a pair {i, j}. Associated\nwith each (oriented) link there is a holonomy Uij , we shall assume for simplicity that it takes value in SU (2). The\nholonomy of the link traversed in the opposite direction is given by the inverse Uji = Uij\u22121 . The Wilson action is given\nby,\nS=\u2212\n\na 0 a 3 X SP\nTr (UP )\n2\nA2P\n\n(49)\n\nP\n\nwhere the sum is over all elementary plaquettes P and AP is the area of the plaquettes. SP is \u22121 if the plaquette is\nspatial and +1 if it is timelike. Notice that we are considering the Lorentzian action, our treatment does not require\na Wick rotation to the Euclidean action. We now will take the limit in which the spacing in the time direction, a0\ngoes to zero. In order to do this we will relabel the links with two indices l, n where the index n labels the position\nof the vertex \"in time\" and the index l runs through all the oriented links that form the spatial sub-lattice Ln at a\ngiven time n. We denote by \u2022l and l\u2022 the vertices at the origin and end of the link l. We rewrite the action and we\nmake explicit the elementary plaquettes that are completely spatial and those that have temporal links,\n\"\n#\n\u0011\n\u0010\nX\na0 a3 X\n1\n1 X\n\u22121\n\u22121\nS=\u2212\nTr Ul,n+1 V\u2022l,n Ul,n Vl\u2022,n \u2212 4\nTr(UPn )\n2 n (a0 a)2\na\nl\u2208Ln\n\nPn\n\nwhere holonomies along timelike links are denoted by the spatial label of the vertex they start and end at, and the\ntime level they start at, like Vl\u2022,n . The second term in the Lagrangian is a sum over all spatial elementary plaquettes\nat time n, Pn . We introduced the\u221afollowing notation\nfor the components of the holonomy, Ul = UlI T I where UlI are\n\u221a\nreal, the T I are given by T 0 = I/ 2, T a = \u2212i\u03c3 a / 2, a = 1 . . . 3 and \u03c3 are the Pauli matrices.\nWe will now take the limit in which a0 \u2192 0. The holonomies along the timelike direction become,\n(\u03bbv )2 2\na0 + . . .\n2\na2\n= 1 \u2212 \u03bbv a0 + (\u03bbv )2 0 + . . .\n2\na20\n= Ul,n + a0 U\u0307l,n + \u00dcl,n . . .\n2\n\nVv,n = 1 + \u03bbv a0 +\n\n(50)\n\n\u22121\nVv,n\n\n(51)\n\nUl,n+1\n\n(52)\n\nwhere v is any vertex of Ln and \u03bbv = \u03bbav T a with \u03bbav real.P\nWe will use as generalized coordinates the variables UlI and\nI\n\u03bbv , normalizing the Lagrangian in such a way that S = n a0 L(n, n + 1)\nThe Lagrangian therefore becomes,\n\u0015\n\u0014\nX\n\u03bb2\u2022l\n\u03bb2l\u2022\n1 \u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2212\nTr U\u0307l \u03bb\u2022l Ul + Ul U\u0307l \u03bbl\u2022 + \u03bbl\u2022 Ul \u03bb\u2022l Ul + U\u0307l U\u0307l \u2212\nL=a\n2\n2\n2\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\n3\n\n+\n\ni\nX Xh\n\u00012\n1 X\nTr (UP ) + a3\n\u03b1l\nUlI \u2212 2\n2a\nP\n\nl\n\n(53)\n\nI=0\n\nWe have dropped the subscript n since all variables are now evaluated on the same time slice. The above sum goes\nover all links traversed only once in a given direction and Ul = Ul\u22121 . We have also included an additional term in the\nLagrangian, which is a constraint that fixes the holonomies to take values in SU (2) provided the \u03bbIv 's are real.\n8\n\n\fIt can be seen that the discrete Lagrange equations of motion coming from this Lagrangian lead, in the limit\na \u2192 0 to Yang\u2013Mills equations. The discretization in this case does not break any gauge symmetry and therefore the\ndiscretized theory is automatically consistent.\nWe now proceed to work out the canonically conjugate momenta,\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2202L 0\n\u2202L a\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nT\n\u2212\nT\n=\na\nU\u0307\n+\n\u03bb\nU\n\u2212\nU\n\u03bb\nl\u2022 l\n\u2022l\nl\nl\n\u2202 U\u0307l0\n\u2202 U\u0307la\n\u2202L\n=0\n\u03a0\u03b1\nl =\n\u2202 \u03b1\u0307l\n\u0001a\n\u2202L\n=0\n=\n\u03a0\u03bbv\n\u2202 \u03bb\u0307av\n\nUI I\n\u03a0U\nl \u2261 \u03a0l T =\n\n(54)\n(55)\n(56)\n\nPerforming the Legendre transform, the Hamiltonian becomes,\n\u0014\n\u0015\nX\n1 U U\n1 X\nU\nTr\nH=\n\u03a0l \u03a0l + \u03a0l (Ul \u03bbl\u2022 \u2212 \u03bb\u2022l Ul ) \u2212\nTr (UPn )\n2a\n2a\nPn\n\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\n\u2212a3\n\nX\nl\n\n\u03b1l\n\n3 h\nX\n\nUlI\n\nI=0\n\n\u00012\n\ni\n\n\u22122 +\n\nX\n\n\u03c1l \u03a0\u03b1\nl +\n\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\n3\nXX\n\n\u03bcva \u03a0\u03bbv\n\nv a=1\n\n\u0001a\n\n(57)\n\nwhere \u03c1l and \u03bcva are Lagrange multipliers. We now need to ensure that the evolution preserves the constraints.\nEnsuring the conservation of (55) leads to\n3 h\nX\nI=0\n\nUlI\n\n\u00012\n\ni\n\u22122 =0\n\n(58)\n\nand conservation of (56) leads to Gauss' law, as we will soon discuss. We now need to ensure the conservation of (58)\nand of Gauss' law. Conservation of (58) leads to\n\u0001\nTr Ul \u03a0U\n= 0.\n(59)\nl\n\nThis implies that the product El \u2261 Ul \u03a0U\nl is an element of the su(2) algebra and is purely imaginary. To understand\nthis, we need to notice two properties. First of all, the object Ul \u03a0U\nl transforms under gauge transformations as a\ngauge vector at the point \u2022l. The second property is that Gauss' law can be rewritten as,\nX\n\u0001\n\u03ba\u2022l El + \u03bal\u2022 El = 0\nG\u2261\n(60)\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\nwhere \u03bav is a smearing function. This is the usual expression of Gauss' law in lattice gauge theory, and shows that\nthe quantity U \u03a0U plays the role of an electric field, and the Gauss law just states that the outgoing flux of electric\nfield lines from point i vanishes. Conservation of Gauss' law is guaranteed, since the action is gauge invariant, but it\ncan be explicitly verified.\nWe still need to conserve in time the constraint that states that U \u03a0U is a purely imaginary element of the algebra.\nThe resulting equation determines the Lagrange multiplier \u03b1l . The fact that the Lagrange multiplier is zero implies\nthat there will be second class constraints. Indeed, constraints (58,59) are second class.\nTo handle the second class constraints we can introduce Dirac brackets. The Dirac brackets become,\nn\n\n\u03a0U\nl\n\n\u0001B\nA\n\nD\n\n, (Ul\u2032 )C\n\no\n\n\u0010\n\u0010 \u0011\n\u0011\ni\nBD\nD C\n= \u221a \u03b4ll\u2032 \u03b4A\n.\n\u03b4B \u2212 Ul\u2020\n(Ul )\nAC\n2 2\n\n(61)\n\nThis relationship was derived, via an independent constructive method by Renteln and Smolin [20]. Based on this\nDirac bracket one can work out the Dirac brackets of the electric field with the holonomy and with itself and one\nrecovers the usual brackets that people assume in lattice gauge theory and that approximate in the limit a \u2192 0 the\nPoisson bracket in the continuum of the electric field with a holonomy.\nWe now proceed to write the Dirac extended Hamiltonian, which is achieved by imposing strongly the second class\nconstraints and adding the first class secondary constraints we found.

This example is revealing in\nthat if we had simply taken equation (53) and attempted a direct quantization ignoring the fact that there were second\nclass constraints it would have been very difficult to reproduce the usual Yang\u2013Mills Hamiltonian in the lattice. All\nattempts to quantize the Hamiltonian constraint of general relativity have ignored the complex canonical structure\nof the discrete Hamiltonian being quantized. To address this issue is the main point of our approach.\nThis example also exhibits how treating time as a continuum variable while discretizing in space yields a complicated\ncanonical structure for the resulting theory. In the case of general relativity it would be expected that complications\nwill be even greater, since the constraint algebra intimately ties space and time. We will therefore from now on only\ndiscuss field theories in which both space and time are discretized. We start by considering the example of Maxwell\ntheory.\nB. Maxwell theory in a discrete space-time\n\nAs in the case of Yang\u2013Mills we start by writing the Wilson action, particularized to the case of a U (1) connection,\n\u0001 1 a0 X\n1 a X\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n+\nUl,n+1\nV\u2022l,n\nUl,n Vl\u2022,n + Ul,n+1 V\u2022l,n Ul,n\nVl\u2022,n\nUPn\n2 a0\n2 a\nPn\n|l|\u2208Ln\nX\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03b1l,n Ul,n Ul,n\n\u2212 1 + a0 a3\n+a0 a3\n\u03b2v,n Vv,n Vv,n\n\u22121\n\nL(n, n + 1) = \u2212\n\n(63)\n\nv\u2208Ln\n\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\nwhere as before Ln es the spatial sub-lattice at a given time n and we label the links with l, the vertices with v and\nthe plaquettes with pn . The sum |l| \u2208 Ln goes over all links traversed only once in a given direction. The holonomies\nalong spatial links are denoted by Ul,n where l is the link and n the \"time level\" at which they live. Holonomies along\ntimelike links are denoted by Vv,n where v is the spatial label of the vertex they start in. In this case U and V are\ncomplex numbers. Given a complex number A we will denote A0 and A1 its real and imaginary parts respectively and\nwe will write A = AI T I where T 0 = 1 y T 1 = i. We will take as generalized coordinates U I , V I and the Lagrange\nmultipliers \u03b1l,n y \u03b2v,n .\nWe shall now derive the canonically conjugate momenta and the equations of motion for each variable.

It should be noted that the evolution equations together with the constraints that imposed unitarity\non the holonomies imply that the momenta are unitary up to a factor,\nU\n\u03a0U\nl,n \u03a0l,n\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n=\n\na2\na20\n\n(72)\n\nwhich we will later need to impose strongly as a constraint.\nFor the momentum \u03a0U\nl,n the Lagrangian leads to\n3\nUl,n \u03a0U\nl,n = \u22122a0 a \u03b1l,n +\n\na\na0 X\nVP l,n \u2212\nUPl\na0\na\n\n(73)\n\nPl\n\nwhere UPl is the holonomy along a spatial plaquette containing the oriented link l and the sum is over all these\nplaquettes. The real part of this equation determines the value of the variable \u03b1l,n and the imaginary part leads to\nthe following evolution equation (on the constraint surface)\nU\nUl,n+1 \u03a0U\nl,n+1 \u2212 Ul,n+1 \u03a0l,n+1\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\nU\n= Ul,n \u03a0U\nl,n \u2212 Ul,n \u03a0l,n\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n\u2212\n\n\u0001\na0 X \u2217\nUPl \u2212 UPl\na\n\n(74)\n\nPl\n\nFor the variable V the canonically conjugate momenta at times n and n + 1 are\n\u03a0Vv,n+1 = 0\nVv,n \u03a0Vv,n\n\n(75)\n\na X\n= \u22122a0 a3 \u03b2v,n +\na0\n\n\u03b4v,l\u2022 VP l,n + \u03b4v,\u2022l VP\u2217l,n .\n\u0001\n\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\n(76)\n\nStudying the evolution of the constraint (75), the real part of equation (76) determines the value of the variable\n\u03b2v,n and the imaginary part (substituting the previous constraints) leads to the constraint that will end up being\nGauss' law,\nh\nX\n\u0001\u2217 i\nU\n=0\n(77)\n\u03c3l,v Ul,n+1 \u03a0U\nl,n+1 \u2212 Ul,n+1 \u03a0l,n+1\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\nwhere \u03c3l,v = \u03b4v,\u2022l \u2212 \u03b4v,l\u2022 . Notice also that there is no evolution equation for the V 's, we will later see that they are\nfree parameters in the theory that correspond to gauge transformations.\nLet us review the constraint structure of the theory. We have the following constraints,\n\u2217\nUl,n Ul,n\n= 1,\n\u2217\nVv,n Vv,n = 1,\n\u0001\na2\nU \u2217\n\u03a0U\n= 2,\nl,n \u03a0l,n\na0\n\nX\n\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\n(78)\n(79)\n(80)\n\nVv,n+1 \u03a0Vv,n+1 + c.c. = 0,\n\n(81)\n\nVv,n+1 \u03a0Vv,n+1\n\n\u2212 c.c. = 0,\n\u03a0\u03b1\nl,n+1 = 0,\n\n(82)\n(83)\n\n\u03a0\u03b2v,n+1 = 0,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c3l,v Ul,n+1 \u03a0U\nl,n+1 \u2212 c.c. = 0,\n\n(84)\n(85)\n\nwhere we have divided the constraint \u03a0Vv,n+1 = 0 into the two linear combinations (81,82). The set of constraints\n(82-85) is first class. The remaining constraints are second class. The constraints that state that U and \u03a0 are unitary\nare second class. We need to work out the non-vanishing Dirac brackets, given by\n\n11\n\n\f\b\nn\n\nUl,n , \u03a0U\nl,n\n\nUl,n , \u03a0U\nl,n\n\n\u0001\u2217 o\n\n\b\nVv,n , \u03a0Vv,n\n\nn\n\u0001\u2217 o\nVv,n , \u03a0Vv,n\n\nDirac\n\nDirac\n\nDirac\n\n\u0011\u2217\n\u0010\n2 \u03a0U\nl,n Ul,n\n=2\u2212 \u0010\n\u0011\u2217\n+ \u03a0U\n\u03a0U\nU\nl,n\nl,n Ul,n\nl,n\n\u0011\u2217\n\u0010\n\u22122 \u03a0U\nUl,n\nl,n\n= \u0010\n\u0011\u2217\n+ \u03a0U\n\u03a0U\nl,n Ul,n\nl,n Ul,n\n\n=1\n\n2\n\nDirac\n\n= \u2212 (Vv,n )\n\n(86)\n\n(87)\n\n(88)\n(89)\n\nand their complex conjugate. At this point we are, in principle, finished with the classical treatment. What we now\nneed to do is to perform a quantization, which entails finding the physical space of states (states that are annihilated\nby the first class constraints) and a unitary evolution operator that embodies the finite canonical transformation that\nyielded the above equations of motion.\nIn order to identify the evolution operator it is desirable to simplify the structure of the theory. This can be achieved\nthrough the introduction of real variables\n\u0011\n\u0001\u2217\ni\u0010 U\n\u2217\nEl,n \u2261\n(90)\n(Ul,n ) ,\n\u03a0l,n Ul,n \u2212 \u03a0U\nl,n\n2\n\u0011\n\u0001\u2217\ni\u0010 V\n\u2217\nV\nEv,n\n\u2261\n(91)\n\u03a0v,n Vv,n \u2212 \u03a0Vv,n (Vv,n ) ,\n2\nthat have simple Dirac brackets,\n\n{El,n , Ul,n }Dirac\n\b\nEl,n , \u03a0U\nl,n Dirac\n\b V\nEv,n , Vv,n Dirac\n\b V\nEv,n , \u03a0Vv,n Dirac\n\n= \u2212i Ul,n\n\n(92)\n\n= \u2212iVv,n\n\n(94)\n\n=\n\n(95)\n\n= +i\n\n\u03a0U\nl,n ,\n\n+i \u03a0Vv,n .\n\n(93)\n\nIn terms of these variables, the first class constraints (82) and (85) become,\n\nX\n\nV\nEv,n\n= 0,\n\n(96)\n\n\u03c3l,v El,n = 0,\n\n(97)\n\n|l|\u2208Ln\n\nand we recognize in the last expression Gauss' law. The simple canonical structure of these variables immediately\nV\nsuggests the introduction of variables canonically conjugate to El,n and Ev,n\n, which we call \u03c6l,n and \u03c6v,n respectively\nand are given given by,\nUl,n = exp (i\u03c6l,n )\nVv,n = exp (i\u03c6v,n )\n\n(98)\n(99)\n\nwith canonical Dirac brackets\n{\u03c6l,n , El,n }Dirac = 1,\n\b\nV\n\u03c6v,n , Ev,n\n= 1.\nDirac\n\nThe new variable has remarkably simple evolution equations. Starting from (74) we get\na0 X\n[U (Pl ) \u2212 U \u2217 (Pl )] .\nEl,n+1 = El,n + i\n2a\n\n(100)\n(101)\n\n(102)\n\nPl\n\nWe need to find an evolution equation for \u03c6. In order to do this, we consider the definition of E, equation (90)\nevaluated at n + 1, and we substitute \u03a0U\nl,n+1 using equation (71). The result is an alternative expression for El,n+1 ,\n12\n\n\fEl,n+1 = i\n\n\u0001\na\nVP l,n \u2212 VP\u2217l,n .\n2a0\n\n(103)\n\nWe now rewrite the right hand side in terms of the angular variables,\nEl,n+1 =\n\na\nsin (\u03c6l,n+1 \u2212 \u03c6l\u2022,n \u2212 \u03c6l,n + \u03c6\u2022l,n ) .\na0\n\nIf we now equate the right hand sides of (102) and (104) we get the desired evolution equation,\n!\na20 X\na0\n\u22121\n\u2217\n\u03c6l,n+1 = \u03c6l\u2022,n + \u03c6l,n \u2212 \u03c6\u2022l,n + sin\nEl,n + i 2\n[U (Pl ) \u2212 U (Pl )] .\na\n2a\n\n(104)\n\n(105)\n\nPl\n\nWith the construction of the simplified variables, we are ready to quantize the theory. We have a canonical\nDirac bracket among variables, so it is immediate to pick a representation for operators and wavefunctions. We\nchoose wavefunctions \u03a8(\u03c6l , \u03c6v , \u03b1l , \u03b2v ). Imposing the first-class constraints (82-85) implies that the wavefunctions are\nindependent of \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03c6, and that as functions of \u03c6 they have to be gauge-invariant (this is the content of the quantum\nGauss law).\nThe quantum evolution equations are obtained by promoting all quantities in equations (102) and (105) to quantum\noperators. The important task is to construct a unitary evolution operator that would embody the time evolution\nimplied by the above discrete quantum evolution equations. We proceed in steps. In order to reproduce the evolution\nequation for E we notice that,\n!\n!\ni\ni\na0 X h\na0 X h\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u00cal,n+1 = exp \u2212i\n(106)\n\u00dbP l + \u00dbP l\n\u00dbP l + \u00dbP l\n= \u00c2\u00cal,n \u00c2\u22121\n\u00cal,n exp i\n2a\n2a\nPl\n\nPl\n\nwhere by\na0 X\n\u00dbP\n\u00c2 = exp \u2212i\n2a\nP\n\n!\n\n(107)\n\nwe denoted the \"partial\" evolution operator y we denote Ul = Ul\u22121 . To reproduce the equation for \u03c6 we notice that,\n\u0010a\n\u0011\n0\n\u03c6\u0302l,n+1 = \u03c6\u0302l\u2022,n + \u03c6\u0302l,n \u2212 \u03c6\u0302\u2022l,n + sin\u22121\n(108)\n\u00cal,n+1\na\nand therefore,\n\n\u03c6\u0302l,n+1\n\n\uf8f6\n\u0010a\nh\n\u0011\n\u0011i\nX \u0010\n0\n\u03c6\u0302\u2022l\u2032 ,n \u2212 \u03c6\u0302l\u2032 \u2022,n \u00cal\u2032 ,n \uf8f8 \u03c6\u0302l,n + sin\u22121\n= \u00c2 exp \uf8edi\n\u00cal,n\na\n|l\u2032 |\u2208Ln\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n\u00d7 exp \uf8ed\u2212i\n\u03c6\u0302\u2022l\u2032 ,n \u2212 \u03c6\u0302l\u2032 \u2022,n \u00cal\u2032 ,n \uf8f8 \u00c2\u22121\n\uf8eb\n\n|l\u2032 |\u2208Ln\n\n\uf8f6\n\u0011\u0015\n0\n\uf8f8 \u03c6\u0302l,n\n\u03c6\u0302\u2022l\u2032 ,n \u2212 \u03c6\u0302l\u2032 \u2022,n \u00cal\u2032 ,n + dx sin\u22121\n= \u00c2 exp \uf8edi\nx\na\nx=\u00cal\u2032 ,n\n|l\u2032 |\u2208Ln\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010 a \u0011\u0015\nX \u0014\u0010\n0\n\uf8f8 \u00c2\u22121 .\n\u00d7 exp \uf8ed\u2212i\nx\n\u03c6\u0302\u2022l\u2032 ,n \u2212 \u03c6\u0302l\u2032 \u2022,n \u00cal\u2032 ,n + dx sin\u22121\na\nx=\u00cal\u2032 ,n\n\u2032\n\uf8eb\n\nX \u0014\u0010\n\nZ\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010a\n\n(109)\n\n|l |\u2208Ln\n\nWe have therefore obtained the evolution operator,\n!\n!\nZ\n\u0010 a \u0011\u0015\nX \u0014\n1\na0 X\n0\nx\n.\n\u03c6\u0302\u2022l\u2032 ,n \u00cal\u2032 ,n +\ndx sin\u22121\n\u00dbP \u00d7 exp i\nF\u0302 = exp \u2212i\n2a\n2\na\n\u2032\nx=\u00cal\u2032 ,n\nP\n\n(110)\n\nl \u2208Ln\n\nWhere the sums are over all possible plaquette and link orientations and we are using that El = \u2212El . This evolution\noperator coincides with the one obtained with the \"transfer matrix method\" in ordinary lattice Maxwell theory (the\n13\n\n\fterm with the Gauss law is not recovered since the transfer matrix method is usually applied in a gauge fixed context).\nSee for instance formula (5.13) of reference [21]. One can take the continuum time limit of this expression a0 \u2192 0\nand one recovers the usual Hamiltonian of lattice Maxwell theory.\nThis concludes our discussion of ordinary lattice gauge theory. It is evident that the proper use of discrete canonical\ntechniques is possible and reproduces well known results of the transfer-matrix method. This method is geared towards\ntheories with a definite time variable and an associated true Hamiltonian. We will now discuss fully constrained\ntheories, which are less suited for treatment with transfer-matrix methods.\nIV. BF THEORIES ON THE LATTICE\n\nTo our knowledge, the transfer-function method has not been applied to fully constrained field theories (like BF\ntheory or general relativity) without performing a gauge fixing (for gauge fixed attempts to lattice gravity see [22]).\nThe techniques we are introducing in this paper, however, are not limited in their ability to handle fully constrained\ntheories. This is good, since it gives hope that they could work in the gravitational case. To begin with we will consider\nthe case of BF theory. BF theory has been quantized by many techniques, since it has a finite number of degrees of\nfreedom. The interest of our approach is that it will yield a discrete theory that has a proper canonical formulation\nand that contains within it solutions that correctly approximate those of the continuum theory at a quantum level.\nThe treatment we discuss applies to BF theories in any dimension. We consider a continuum action of the form,\nZ\nS = Tr (B \u2227 F )\n(111)\nwhere F is a 2-form associated with a connection (to make things concrete, let us assume it is an su(2) connection,\nalthough our method extends easily to other semisimple groups) and B is a D \u2212 2 su(2)-valued form.\nIn the continuum, if we perform an N + 1 decomposition, where N = D \u2212 1, one ends up with a system of first-class\nconstraints given by,\nDa E a = 0,\nFab = 0,\n\n(112)\n(113)\n\nwhere E a = \u01ebabc... Bbc... is the spatial dual of the spatial pull-back of the form B and Fab is the spatial pull-back of the\ncurvature F , indices a, b, . . . run from 1 to D \u2212 1. So the content of the theory is that the connection is flat and there\nis a Gauss law. Quantum mechanically, the constraints are solved by functionals of connections that have support on\nflat connections only and are SU (2) invariant. The theory only therefore has a finite number of degrees of freedom\nand is non-trivial only in non-trivial spatial topologies. In (2 + 1) dimensions the theory (with an SU (2) group) is\nequivalent to Euclidean Einstein gravity.\nWe discretize the BF action in the following way,\n\"\nX\n\u0001\u2020 2 \u0001\u2020\n\u0001\u2020\n\u2020\n0\n2\nL(n, n + 1) =\nhn,v + Bn,v\nTr Bn,v\nh1n,v h2n,v+e1 h1n,v+e2\nVn,v h1n+1,v (Vn,v+e1 ) h1n,v\n(114)\nv\n\n\u2020\n\n1\n\u2212 Bn,v\nVn,v h2n+1,v (Vn,v+e2 )\n\nh2n,v\n\n\u0001\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\u2212I +\n+ \u03bcn,v Vn,v Vn,v\n\n\u0001\n\n2\nX\n\nk=1\n\n#\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0001\n\u2020\n\u03bbkn,v hkn,v hkn,v \u2212 I .\n\nTo explain the notation we refer to figure IV. From now on we will assume we are in 2 + 1 dimensions in order to\nsimplify notation although it will be evident that simple generalizations of the formulae will hold in any number of\ndimensions. By hkn,v we mean the holonomy along the direction k (in the 2 + 1 dimensional case it is either along\nthe elementary unit vectors e1 or e2 ) starting at the lattice point labeled by the time step n and the spatial point\nv (in 2 + 1 dimensions v is labeled by a pair of indices. By the index v + ek we mean the lattice point arrived to\nby following ek starting at lattice point v. The B fields live D \u2212 2 hypersurfaces dual to the plaquette on which\nwe compute the holonomy representing the F and are elements of the algebra of SU (2).

Therefore one is dealing\nwith a flat connection on the plaquette. As expected, the discrete theory admits more solutions than the continuum\none, in the sense that a possible solution would be a connection that makes the holonomy +1 on certain plaquettes\nand \u22121 on others. Such solutions will not admit a continuum counterpart.\nWe need to check that the Dirac brackets of the elementary variables lead to the expected results. Here we can just\nrefer to the discussion we did in the Yang\u2013Mills case, since the structure of the second class constraints (117,137) is\nsimilar to the one we encountered in that case.\nThe quantization of the theory is now immediate. The Dirac bracket between the electric field and the holonomy\nis similar to the one in the Maxwell case (92),\nn\n\u0001A k o\nk\nEn,v\n, hn,v = iT A hkn,v\n(144)\n\nwhere we have introduced the component notation in the algebra and the T A 's are the generators of su(2) we\nintroduced before.\nOne can now consider wavefunctions that are functions of the holonomies on the links of the lattice, \u03a8[hkn,v ].\nFollowing the Dirac method we need to impose the constraints as operator equations. Gauss' law will just state that\nthe wavefunctions are gauge invariant. In this case it will imply that the wavefunctions are linear combinations of\ntraces of holonomies along closed loops.\nWe now need to impose the spatial projection of the constraint (123) as an operatorial equation,\n2\n12\n= \u03c3n,v\nI.\nh1n,v\n\n(145)\n\nIn the space of functions of holonomies the equation becomes multiplicative and the solution is that the holonomies\nalong all elementary plaquettes should be \u00b11 times the identity. We therefore see that we recover as solutions of the\ntheory the space of gauge invariant functions of a flat connection. Except that in the discrete theory it could happen\nthat in some plaquettes the holonomies are +1 times the identity whereas in others the holonomies have a negative\nsign. Such solutions are possible in the discrete theory and do not have a counterpart in the continuum. We see that\nthe discrete theory therefore has considerably richer solution structure than the continuum theory. If one however\nimposes that the solutions be continuous from one plaquette to another, one is only left with the traditional solution.\nThe unitary operator that implements the finite canonical transformation is, for this theory, given by an exponential\nof a combination of the first class constraints with arbitrary coefficients.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have generalized classical mechanics to systems in which space and time are discrete. Time evolution is\nimplemented through a finite canonical transformation. Constrained systems can be incorporated in the scheme. We\ndiscussed in detail how to handle Yang\u2013Mills theory, Maxwell theory and BF theory and encountered no problem\nsetting up the classical and quantum theory. In general, the discrete theories contain many solutions that do not have\na good continuum limit, as we have seen in the BF example, and the correct solution has to be chosen by requesting\nthat it have the appropriate semiclassical limit.\nThe framework we have set up is completely ready to be applied to the case of general relativity, which will have\nmany similarities with the BF case. An attractive advantage is that the formalism does not require an Euclidean\nrotation and operates directly in terms of the Lorentzian signature theory. We will discuss the case of general relativity\nin a forthcoming publication. Having a sound theoretical foundation for dealing with discretized gravity will allow\nquantize the theory in a systematic way and will enable us to make connections between the canonical and path\nintegral approaches.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe wish to thank Abhay Ashtekar, Martin Bojowald and Karel Kucha\u0159 for comments.
