Instead, the decay time for flipping of\nthe magnetisation follows an Arrhenius law on the square and simple cubic lattice.\nOn directed Barab\u00e1si-Albert networks with two and seven neighbours selected by\neach added site, Metropolis and Glauber algorithms give similar results, while for\nWolff cluster flipping the magnetisation decays exponentially with time.\n\nIntroduction\nS\u00e1nchez et al some years ago showed that the Metropolis algorithm, applied to directed Watts-Strogatz (small-world) networks has a spontaneous\nmagnetisation, even in the limit of directed random graphs[1]. More recently,\nSumour and Shabat [2, 3] investigated Ising models on directed Barab\u00e1siAlbert networks [4] with the usual Glauber dynamics. No spontaneous magnetisation was found, in contrast to the case of undirected Barab\u00e1si-Albert\nnetworks [5, 7] where a spontaneous magnetisation was found below a critical temperature which increases logarithmically with system size. Now we\nsimulate directed square, cubic and hypercubic lattices in two to five dimensions with heat bath dynamics in order to separate the network effects form\nthe effects of directedness. And we compare different spin flip algorithms,\nincluding cluster flips [8], for Ising-Barab\u00e1si-Albert networks. In all these\ncases spins were flipped according to algorithms well established to equilibrate systems described by an Ising energy, even though the directed systems\nare not described by such an energy [1], in contrast to an earlier assertion by\none of us [3].\n\n1\n\n\f1001 x 1001 at J/kT = 4\n\nmagnetisation\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n0\n\n2000\n\n4000\n\n6000\n\n8000\n\n10000\n\ntime\nFigure 1: Variation of normalised magnetisation on a square lattice at a temperature which is an order of magnitude lower than the critical temperature\nof the usual undirected square lattice.\nLattices\nWe start with all spins up and update them by going through the lattice regularly like a typewriter, numbering them consecutively i = 1, 2, 3 . . ..\nHelical boundary conditions were used by storing the lowest hyperplane in\na buffer on top of the lattice; with the upper buffer fixed to +1 the decay\ntimes were much longer. The probability for spin Si = \u00b11 to be +1 in this\ndirected lattice is\npi = 1/(1 + exp(2Ei )/kT ),\n\nEi = \u2212JSi\n\nX\n\nSk\n\nk<i\n\nwhere the inner sum runs over all nearest neighbours k of i with k < i, on\nthe hypercubic lattice; in the usual undirected case the restriction k < i is\nmissing. Thus on a square lattice, the spin Si is influenced only by its left\nand top neighbours, not by the right and bottom neighbours. This directed\ninfluence violates Newton's law actio = \u2212reactio.\n2\n\n\f101 x 101 (x) and 1001 x 1001 (+)\n100000\n\ndecay time\n\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n2.5\nJ/kT\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: Time for the magnetisation to become negative, versus inverse\ntemperature, on large (+, lower cloud) and small (x, upper cloud) lattices.\nWe show the median of three runs at each temperature.\nFor the square lattice, Fig.1 shows an example how the magnetisation\njumps from nearly +1 to nearly \u20131, similar to [3] and different from the usual\nundirected Ising model. Fig.2 shows the time after which the magnetisation\nfirst becomes negative; this time fluctuates strongly but follows roughly an\nexponential increase as in an Arrhenius law \u221d exp(const J/kT ). For a lattice\nwith hundred times less spins the times are slightly larger, suggesting that a\nrare nucleation event destroys the metastable state and lets the magnetisation\nflip. A power law seems to fit less well, Fig.3.\nIn higher dimensions, Fig.4, the increase of the decay time happens in a\nmuch smaller interval of J/kT (hundred times smaller in 3D than in 2D) and\nperhaps indicates a transition to ferromagnetism. However, closer inspection\nof three dimensions at the lowest temperatures, Fig.4b, suggests also here\nan exponential Arrhenius increase instead of a divergence at a positive temperature. Perhaps the same effect happens in four and five dimensions; and\n3\n\n\fDistance of J/kT from 4.3\n100000\n\ndecay time\n\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n\n1\ndistance\n\nFigure 3: Same data as in Fig.2, shown on a log-log plot with a critical\ntemperature assumed at J/kT = 4.3. Note that the curvature persists for\nboth small and large lattices, suggesting that now power law corresponding\nto a straight line is valid.\nat least in infinite dimensions (or perhaps already in four dimensions) the\nslope of log(flipping time) versus J/kT becomes infinite, meaning a timeindependent Tc below which the magnetisation retains its initial sign.\nFig.5 shows a probability distribution function P (m) for the magnetisation m as in usual Ising models: Two wings for T < Tc and one central peak\nfor T > Tc . However, in usual large Ising models the magnetization does\nnot flip below Tc while in our directed square or cubic lattices it does. The\ntemperature T\u03c4 above which this probability distribution gets its two wings\ndecreases logarithmically towards zero with increasing observation time; for\nT < T\u03c4 the magnetisation retains its initial sign. (T\u03c4 \u2192 Tc for large directed\nIsing models.)\nBarab\u00e1si-Albert Networks\nWe now return to the directed scale-free networks of Barab\u00e1si-Albert type\n4\n\n\f101^3 (+), 31^4 (x), 17^5 (*)\n1e+06\n\ndecay time\n\n100000\n10000\n1000\n100\n10\n1\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n0.4\nJ/kT\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n101 x 101 x 101\n1e+06\n\ndecay time\n\n100000\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n0.66\n\n0.665\n\n0.67\n0.675\nJ/kT\n\n0.68\n\n0.685\n\nFigure 4: Three, four and five dimensions, plotted analogously to Fig.2 in\npart a.

We always use half a million spins,\nwith each site added to the network selecting m = 2 or 7 already existing\nsites as neighbours influencing it; the newly added spin does not influence\nthese neighbours.\nWith J/kT = 1.0 and 1.7, we confirmed [2, 3] the unusual behaviour of\nthe magnetisation, which for m = 7 stays close to 1 for a long time inspite of\nfluctuations. These fluctuations were smaller for Metropolis than for Glauber\n(heat bath) kinetics, Fig.6. For m = 2, the magnetisations are much smaller\n(not shown).

This lack of a\nspontaneous magnetisation (in the usual sense) is consistent with the fact\nthat if on a directed lattice a spin Sj influences spin Si , then spin Si in\nturn does not influence Sj . Thus there is no feedback and this hinders the\nstabilisation of a spontaneous magnetisation. The system has no well defined\nenergy (in contrast to [3]) and no thermal equilibrium and thus is similar to\ncellular automata or asymmetric neural networks. Thus, even for the same\nscale-free networks, different algorithms give different results.\nWe thank P.M.C. de Oliveira for helpful criticism, and J.M.
