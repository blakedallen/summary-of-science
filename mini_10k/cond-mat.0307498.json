In practically all cases the parameters characterizing a particular\nsystem are only constant on a limited time scale. On longer time scales they may change\ntheir values because the surrounding environment slowly changes its state. We just note\nthat even the most fundamental \"constants\" of nature like e.g. the fine structure constant\npossibly undergo a very slow change in time [1]. On the other hand, most natural processes\nalso display very fast changes which usually will be disregarded in a phenomenological description. They only will show up in a microscopic description in which the effective degrees\nof freedom of the phenomenological model are represented as functions of microscopic degrees of freedom. The time evolution of these microscopic degrees of freedom typically takes\nplace on much faster time scales than those of the macroscopic observables whereas, as already mentioned, global aspects of the environment may undergo temporal variations that\nare much slower than the dynamics of the considered macroscopic system.\nIt is this separation of time scales that allows one to describe a system in terms of a\ncomparatively simple model that is closed in the sense that only a few macroscopic observables are subject to the dynamics. On the slow time scale the key technical notion here is\nthat of a constraint equilibrium that is reached by the fast part of a system before the slow\nconstituents change their values on the slower time scale. This constraint equilibrium then\nimmediately adapts to the changes of the slow system.\nThis approach has been applied in many branches of physics and other sciences and is\nvital for various methods like adiabatic elimination, averaging, synergetics, subdynamics,\nchemical kinetics and hierarchical computational schemes [2]. In the present paper we consider Markovian processes the dynamics of which can be subdivided into a fast and a slow\ncomponent. In particular, we have in mind the case where the slow motion is caused by\ntransitions between metastable states [3]. The relaxation toward these states constitutes the\nfast part of the dynamics. Additionally, some of the system's parameters may undergo slow\nvariations in time that may be caused by a slow drift, or fluctuations of the parameters, or\nby an external driving of the system. The dynamics of the considered system then has two\nslow components: The transitions and the driving. About their relation we do not make\nfurther assumptions: The slow intrinsic dynamics can be faster or slower than the external\n2\n\n\fdriving that must only be slow compared to the fast dynamics of the system. In Ref. [4] we\nhave called this type of situation the semiadiabatic limit, in contrast to the adiabatic limit\nin which the driving is slow compared to the total intrinsic dynamics including that of the\ntransitions. Clearly, the adiabatic limit is contained in the semiadiabatic limit as a special\ncase.\nStochastic resonance is just one example for which the semiadiabatic limit is of relevance\nwhen the period of the signal is large [5, 6]. Ratchets, or Brownian motors, provide another\nclass of systems which also operate in the semiadiabatic regime [7]. Atomic force microscopes\nand optical tweezers often act on time scales that are slow compared to the vibrational and\nother intrinsic time-scales of the molecules that are manipulated by them [8].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. II the reduction of a Fokker-Planck process\nwith multiple mestastable states to a master equation is reviewed as it was developed in\nRefs. [9, 10]. This method is generalized to processes with slowly time dependent parameters\nin Sect. III. The time rate of change of the probability now consists of two contributions.\nOne is given by the rate as it would result if the parameters of the process were frozen and\nthe other contribution mainly takes into account the changes of the geometry of the domains\nof attraction of the metastable states. This geometric contribution is proportional to the\ntime rate of change of the parameters and therefore is negligible compared to the frozen\nrates if the time dependent parameters change sufficiently slowly. In contrast to previous\ninvestigations, [11] we find that the fastest time dependence of the parameters for which one\nmay neglect the geometric contributions is not only determined by the deterministic time\nscales of the process but in general also depends on the strength of the noise. The way how\nthe noise here enters depends on the particular process.\nThe present investigation is complementary to previous work that is restricted to periodic\ndriving with an intermediate regime of external driving frequencies [12].\nIn Sect. IV we assume the validity of the master equation with frozen rates and determine\na time dependent decoration of the discrete states such that the dynamics of the continuous\nvariables of the underlying Fokker-Planck process are recovered on the long time scale. The\narchetypical example for stochastic resonance namely that of a periodically damped bistable\nBrownian oscillator is discussed in Sect. V and the validity of the McNamara-Wiesenfeld\nmodel of stochastic resonance [13] is discussed. The paper ends with a summary in Sect. VI.\n\n3\n\n\fII.\n\nMULTISTABLE SYSTEMS AT SMALL NOISE\n\nIn this section we review the reduction of a Fokker-Planck equation describing a timehomogeneous process with multiple metastable states to a master equation that gives the\ndynamics on the time scales of the transitions between the metastable states. For this\npurpose we consider a dynamical system under the influence of weak random forces and\nassume that these forces can be modeled by Gaussian white noise. Then the stochastic\ndynamics is described by a Fokker-Planck equation [14]:\n\u2202\n\u03c1(x, t) = L\u03c1(x, t)\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L denotes the Fokker-Planck operator:\nL=\u2212\n\nX \u22022\nX \u2202\nKi (x) +\nDij (x)\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\ni,j\ni\n\n(2)\n\nHere, x = (x1 , x2 , ...xn ) denotes a point with coordinates xi in the n-dimensional state space\n\u03a3; further, K(x) = (Ki (x)) is the drift vector and D(x) = (Di,j (x)) the diffusion matrix\nresulting from the random forces. We further restrict ourselves to systems with a uniquely\ndefined stationary probability density \u03c10 (x) with respect to which detailed balance holds.\nConsequently, the Fokker-Planck operator satisfies the relation [14]:\nL\u03c1\u03020 = \u03c1\u03020 L\u0303+ .\n\n(3)\n\nwhere L+ is the backward, or adjoint Fokker-Planck operator:\nL+ = Ki (x)\n\n\u2202\n\u22022\n+ Di,j (x)\n.\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n\n(4)\n\nThe tilde denotes the operation of time reversal, i.e. x\u0303i = \u01ebi xi with parity \u01ebi = \u00b11 and \u03c1\u03020\nis the multiplication operator with the probability density, i.e. \u03c1\u03020 f (x) = \u03c10 (x)f (x) where\nf (x) is an arbitrary state space function.\nIn the deterministic limit the diffusion matrix goes to zero and the drift vector approaches\nthe deterministic vector field K(0) (x) governing the deterministic motion of the system:\n\u1e8b(t) = K(0) (x(t))\n\n(5)\n\nIn the presence of weak random perturbations K(x) may differ from K0 (x) by small noise\ninduced contributions.\n4\n\n\f\u03a3\n\n\u03b1:\n\nD1\n\nD2\n\nD3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFIG. 1: The overdamped deterministic motion \u1e8b(t) = \u2212V \u2032 (x(t)) in the above shown potential\ninduces a partitioning of the state space \u03a3 = R1 into the domains of attraction D\u03b1 of the three\nattractors \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3 at the potential minima. Here the locations of the local potential maxima\ncoincide with the boundaries between the domains of attraction.\n\nWe here are interested in cases where the deterministic system (5) has a number m of\ncoexisting attractors labeled by \u03b1. To each attractor \u03b1 there belongs a domain of attraction\nD\u03b1 . The domains are disjoint and partition the total available state space:\nD\u03b1\n\n\\\n\nm\n[\n\nD\u03b1\u2032 = \u2205 for \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032\n\n(6)\n\nD\u03b1 = \u03a3\n\n(7)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nFor weak noise the stationary probability density is almost zero everywhere except close\nto the attractors. If the noise vanishes the stationary density shrinks to Dirac \u03b4-functions\nsitting at the attractors of the deterministic system. Because no transitions between the\ndifferent attractors may occur in the noiseless case, each of the delta functions is a stationary solution of the Fokker-Planck equation \u2202/\u2202xi Ki0 (x)\u03c10 (x) = 0 belonging to a m-fold\ndegenerate eigenvalue 0.\nThe degeneracy also follows from the backward equation which is governed by the adjoint\n5\n\n\fFokker-Planck operator L+ defined in eq. (4). In the deterministic case the diffusion matrix\nvanishes, so the second derivatives disappear and the stationary solutions of the backward\noperator are constant along the trajectories of the deterministic system. Because within a\ndomain of attraction all trajectories approach the same attractor the stationary solutions of\nthe noiseless backward equation are constant on the domain of attraction D\u03b1 . One then can\n(0)\n\nchoose the characteristic functions \u03c7\u03b1 (x) of the domains of attraction as m independent\n(0)\n\nsolutions of the stationary deterministic backward equation Ki (x)\u2202\u03c7(0) (x)/\u2202xi = 0:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f21\nfor x \u2208 D\u03b1\n\u03c7(0)\n(x)\n=\n\u03b1\n\uf8f30\nelse\n\n(8)\n\nIn the presence of weak noise these functions can be modified slightly such that they still\nsolve the stationary backward equation up to corrections that are exponentially small in\nthe noise strength: The step-like discontinuities then are smeared out on layers located\nat the boundaries of the domains of attraction D\u03b1 . The functions can be constructed by\n\nmeans of the method of matched asymptotic expansions [15], see also Refs. [9, 10]. Outside\nthe boundary layers no modification is required and hence they retain their property of\nlocalizing the different domains of attraction. In the following, these localizing functions\nwill be denoted by \u03c7\u03b1 (x). We summarize their main properties: They solve L+ \u03c7\u03b1 (x) = 0\nup to exponentially small corrections in the noise strength, have the values one within and\nzero outside D\u03b1 and interpolate between these values smoothly on a thin boundary layer\n[16, 17]. As solutions of these particular boundary value problems, the functions \u03c7\u03b1 (x) are\nthe splitting probabilities that give the relative frequencies with which a trajectory starting\nat x first reaches the attractor \u03b1 before it visits any other attractor [18].\nThe splitting probabilities in general are not eigenfunctions of the backward operator.\nHowever, they span the subspace of eigenfunctions that emerges from the eigenspace of the\nm-fold degenerate eigenvalue 0 of the deterministic dynamics if weak noise perturbes the\nsystem and lifts the degeneracy. The resulting finite eigenvalues are still small compared\nto all other finite eigenvalues. Hence, this subspace describes the slow dynamics of the\nsystem at weak noise. In particular, it contains the constant function which is the exact\neigenfunction of the backward equation belonging to the eigenvalue 0. At weak noise this\neigenfunction can be represented as the sum over the characteristic functions \u03c7\u03b1 (x):\nX\n\u03c7\u03b1 (x) = 1.\n\u03b1\n\n6\n\n(9)\n\n\fBecause of detailed balance, the slow subspace of the forward operator is spanned by\nthe basis set {\u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x)\u03c10 (x)}, where \u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x) = \u03c7\u03b1 (x\u0303) denotes the image of \u03c7a (x) under time\nreversal. Hence, the probability density describing the slow dynamics can be represented as:\n\u03c1(x, t) =\n\nm\nX\n\nc\u03b1 (t)\u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x)\u03c10 (x)\n\n(10)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nAs already noted the characteristic functions \u03c7\u03b1 (x) and, therefore also their time reversed\npartners \u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x), are well localized functions as long as the noise does not become too large.\nAs a consequence, one may use the functions \u03c7\u03b1 (x) in order to determine the probability\np\u03b1 (t) that the system resides in the domain of attraction of the attractor \u03b1 [10]:\np\u03b1 (t) = (\u03c7\u03b1 , \u03c1(t))\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the scalar product is defined as the integral of the product of its arguments over the\nstate space:\n(f, g) =\n\nZ\n\ndn xf (x)g(x).\n\n(12)\n\n\u03a3\n\nIf we assume that the probability density \u03c1(t) is of the form (10) we obtain\np\u03b1 (t) = c\u03b1 (t)n\u03b1\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we have made use of the localization of the characteristic functions at weak noise:\n(\u03c7\u03b1 , \u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 \u03c10 ) = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 n\u03b1\nand have introduced the function n\u03b1 =\n\nR\n\ndx\u03c7\u03b1 (x)\u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x)\u03c10 (x) \u2248\n\n(14)\nR\n\ndx\u03c7\u03b1 (x)\u03c10 (x) giving the\n\npopulation of the metastable state \u03b1 in the equilibrium distribution \u03c10 (x).\nThe time evolution of the probabilities p\u03b1 (t) now follows from the projection of the\nFokker-Planck equation (1) onto the slow subspace, i.e. we assume the probability density\nto take the form (10) and determine the scalar product with \u03c7\u03b1 (x) on both sides of the\nFokker-Planck equation. This yields\nX (\u03c7a , L\u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 \u03c10 )\nd\np\u03b1 (t) =\np\u03b1\u2032 (t)\ndt\nn\u03b1\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(15)\n\n\u03b1\n\nUnder the sum on the right hand side we expressed the coefficients c\u03b1\u2032 (t) by means of eq. (13)\nin terms of the probabilities p\u03b1\u2032 (t) leading to the equilibrium weights n\u03b1\u2032 in the denominator\nof the respective coefficient. For \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032 the coefficient (\u03c7\u03b1 , L\u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 \u03c10 ) /n\u03b1\u2032 coincides with the\n7\n\n\fRayleigh-quotient expressions for the rate from \u03b1\u2032 to \u03b1 [17]. The integral is dominated\nby a neighborhood of the saddle point that connects the domains of attraction D\u03b1\u2032 and\nD\u03b1 [19]. Within this neighborhood, for small noise, the localizing function \u03c7\u03b1 (x) can be\napproximated by the characteristic function of D\u03b1 , \u03c70\u03b1 (x) [20]. The resulting coefficient then\ncoincides with the better known flux-over-population expression for the respective rate [3].\nIn particular, one can show that for sufficiently weak noise the expression (\u03c7\u03b1 , L\u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 \u03c10 ) /n\u03b1\u2032\nis positive for \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032 . From eq. (9) it follows that the sum of the coefficients over \u03b1 vanishes.\nHence, eq. (15) has the proper form of a master equation:\nX\nX\nd\nr\u03b1\u2032,\u03b1 p\u03b1 (t)\np\u03b1 (t) =\nr\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 p\u03b1\u2032 (t) \u2212\ndt\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\n(16)\n\n\u03b1 6=\u03b1\n\n\u03b1 6=\u03b1\n\nwhere\nr\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 =\n\n(\u03c7\u03b1 , L\u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 \u03c10 )\nn\u03b1\u2032\n\n(17)\n\nis the transition probability per unit time from \u03b1\u2032 to \u03b1.\nThe regime of validity of this approximation, of course, depends on the particular system\nand the degree of accuracy one would like to achieve. By its very nature this master equation\nis only appropriate for the long time dynamics of the Fokker-Planck equation and therefore\nrequires a clear separation of time scales dividing the process into fast relaxations within\nthe domains of attraction and slow transitions between the attractors. We note that various\ndefinitions of transition rates exist which are different from a physical point of view but\nwhich still yield the same result if a master equation provides a correct description of the\nlong time dynamics. It turns out that the actual differences between these rate expressions\nare exponentially small in the noise strength, i.e. of the form exp {\u2212\u2206V /kB T } where \u2206V\nis a relevant barrier hight and kB T the noise strength. So if we are ready to accept an error\nof, say 1%, all barriers in the system must be higher than approximately 4.5kB T .\n\nIII.\n\nSLOW DRIVING\n\nAfter these preparatory considerations we turn to our main topic and consider a FokkerPlanck process of the kind of the previous section with the only difference that we now allow\nfor slow changes of the parameters of the system. These could result from a slow drift of\nthe environmental parameters of the system like e.g. the temperature, a slow increase of an\nexternal field, or a slow periodic force driving the system, to name but a few realizations.\n8\n\n\fWe emphasize that the change of the parameters must be slow compared to the fast\nrelaxation within each domain of attraction but no assumption is made how it compares\nto the slow intrinsic dynamics of the system describing the transitions between different\ndomains of attraction. We assume that in the presence of these time dependent parameters\none still can identify domains of attraction which do not merge or split as time changes but\nretain their identity. In other words, we restrict ourselves to changes of the parameters that\ndo not lead to topological changes of the system.\nThe resulting process is still Markovian and is governed by a Fokker-Planck equation:\n\u2202\n\u03c1(t) = L(t)\u03c1(t)\n\u2202t\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the Fokker-Planck operator L(t) is of the form given in eq. (2) with time dependent\ndrift K(x, t) and possibly also a time dependent diffusion matrix D(x, t). In particular,\nwe assume that all parameter values which the system experiences in the course of time\ncorrespond to equilibrium systems, i.e. that for any frozen parameter value the system will\nreach an equilibrium distribution relative to which the system obeys detailed balance:\nL(t)\u03c1\u03020 (t) = \u03c1\u03020 (t)L\u0303+ (t)\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the tilde denotes time reversal and \u03c1\u03020 (t) is the multiplication operator with the equilibrium distribution \u03c10 (x, t) that would be attained if the parameter values were frozen at\nthe values that they assume at time t:\nL(t)\u03c10 (x, t) = 0.\n\n(20)\n\nFor vanishing noise the system will move toward the nearest attractor as defined by the\nmomentary values of the parameters. During this relaxation time, the parameters of the\nsystem are supposed to change by such a small amount that they can be considered as kept\nconstant. Only when the system has reached the attractor and stays there for a much longer\ntime, the change of parameters will become noticeable and the system will follow the slow\nmotion of the attractor as it results from the changing parameters. This means that the\ntime rate of change of the deterministic drift is characterized by a small parameter \u01eb:\n|K\u0307(x, t)|\n\u03c4r = O(\u01eb)\n|K(x, t)|\n9\n\n(21)\n\n\fwhere \u03c4r is a typical relaxation time of the deterministic motion. Under this very condition\nmany of the properties of the time homogeneous process carry over to the case with time\ndependent parameters.\nTo each attractor \u03b1 then there belongs a domain of attraction D\u03b1 (t) together with its\n(0)\n\ncharacteristic function \u03c7\u03b1 (x, t) which is 1 on D\u03b1 (t) and 0 elsewhere in \u03a3. The domains of\nattractions also slowly depend on time and so do the characteristic functions. If the system\nis weakly perturbed by noise the characteristic functions will change into smooth functions\n\u03c7\u03b1 (x, t) that coincide with the noiseless functions everywhere except in a thin boundary\nlayer at \u2202D\u03b1 (t), where a steep but smooth transition from 1 to 0 takes place. As in the time\nindependent case, they are solutions of the homogeneous backward equation that approach\n1 in the interior of D\u03b1 (t) and vanish on all other attractors \u03b1\u2032 6= \u03b1. Further one also can\nrepresent the slow dynamics of the probability density in terms of linear combinations of\n\u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x, t)\u03c10 (x, t):\n\u03c1(x, t) =\n\nm\nX\n\nc\u03b1 (t)\u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x, t)\u03c10 (x, t)\n\n(22)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nThe probabilities to find the system in the state \u03b1 is analogously defined as in the case with\nconstant parameters:\np\u03b1 (t) = (\u03c7\u03b1 (t), \u03c1(t))\n\n(23)\n\nThe time rate of change of p\u03b1 (t) consequently has two contributions, resulting from the\nderivative of \u03c7\u03b1 (x, t) and of \u03c10 (x, t):\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nd\n\u2202\n\u2202\np\u03b1 (t) =\n\u03c7\u03b1 (t), \u03c1(t) + \u03c7\u03b1 (t), \u03c1(t) .\ndt\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\n(24)\n\nThe latter probabilistic contribution can be expressed in terms of the Fokker-Planck equation\nyielding\n\u0013 X\n\u0012\n\u2202\nr\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t)p\u03b1 (t)\n\u03c7\u03b1 , \u03c1(t) =\n\u2202t\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n(25)\n\nwhere we used eq. (22) and introduced the time dependent transition rates r\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t) in an\nanalogous way as in the time homogeneous case, see eq. (17):\nr\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t) =\n\n(\u03c7\u03b1 (t), L(t)\u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 (t)\u03c10 (t))\n.\nn\u03b1\u2032 (t)\n\n(26)\n\nIt determines the rate of change of the probability p\u03b1 (t) caused by transitions from \u03b1\u2032 to \u03b1.\nHere n\u03b1\u2032 (t) is the population of the metastable state \u03b1\u2032 in the frozen equilibrium distribution\n10\n\n\f\u03c10 (x, t). It is given by:\nn\u03b1 (t) = (\u03c7\u03b1 (t), \u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (t)\u03c10 (t)) \u2248 (\u03c7\u03b1 (t), \u03c10 (t))\n\n(27)\n\nwhere the term \u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x, t) is neglected in the second equation. This approximation holds up\nto exponentially small terms in the noise strength.\nThe other contribution, (\u2202\u03c7\u03b1 (t)/\u2202t, \u03c1(t)), describes the change of the probability caused\nby the geometric change of the domain D\u03b1 (t). It also is linear in the probabilities p\u03b1\u2032 (t) and\ncan be written as\n\u0012\n\n\u2202\n\u03c7\u03b1 (t), \u03c1(t)\n\u2202t\n\nwhere\ng\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t) =\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nX\n\ng\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t)p\u03b1\u2032 (t)\n\n(28)\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u2202\n\u03c7 (t), \u03c7\u0303\u03b1\u2032 (t)\u03c10 (t)\n\u2202t \u03b1\n\nn\u03b1\u2032 (t)\n\n\u0001\n\n(29)\n\nThe coefficients g\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t) are proportional to the smallness parameter \u01eb because they contain\nthe time derivative of \u03c7\u03b1 (x, t). The proportionality factor roughly is of the same order of\nmagnitude as the transition rate r\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t):\ng\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t)\n= O(\u01eb)\nr\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t)\n\n(30)\n\nThe dependence of this ratio on the noise strength is discussed for a particular example in\nsection V. For a sufficiently slow parameter change, i.e a small value of \u01eb, the geometric\ncontribution to the time rate of change of the probability p\u03b1 (t) can be neglected and a master\nequation results that is completely determined by the instantaneous rates r\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t):\nX\nX\nd\nr\u03b1\u2032 ,\u03b1 (t)p\u03b1 (t)\nr\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t)p\u03b1\u2032 (t) \u2212\np\u03b1 (t) =\ndt\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03b1 6=\u03b1\n\u03b1 6=\u03b1\n\n(31)\n\nwhere we used that the time dependent rates r\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t) (26) have the same general form and\ntherefore the same formal properties as the time independent ones (17): Those for \u03b1 6= \u03b1\u2032\nP\nare positive and the sum over the first index vanishes: \u03b1 r\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 (t) = 0. This master equation\n\nwith time dependent rates is the central result of the present paper. For faster driving the\ngeometric contributions of the rates have to be taken into account. However, they may\nbecome negative, and therefore formally negative rates may result if the driving is too fast.\nThis indicates that then the instananeous eigenfunctions of the Fokker Planck equation no\nlonger provide a good basis.\n\n11\n\n\fIV.\n\nDECORATING THE META-STABLE STATES\n\nOften the knowledge of the probabilities p\u03b1 (t) to find the system at time t in the metastable state \u03b1 is not sufficient. For example one may be interested in the average position x\nof the system or its single- or multi-time statistical properties. We here show how the time\ndependence of these quantities on the slow time scales of the transitions and the external\ndriving can be retrieved from exactly the same information that is necessary to determine\nthe transition rates from the Fokker-Planck equation. For that purpose we first consider the\naverage of an arbitrary function f (x) of the position:\nZ\nhf (t)i =\ndn xf (x)\u03c1(x, t)\nX\n=\nhf (t)|\u03b1ip\u03b1 (t)\n\n(32)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere hf (t)|\u03b1i denotes the expectation value of f (x) under the condition that the system\nresides at t in the domain of attraction D\u03b1 (t). Using the long-time behavior of the probability\ndensity \u03c1(t) as given by eq. (22) one finds:\nZ\nhf (t)|\u03b1i = dn xf (x)\u03c1(x, t|\u03b1)\n\n(33)\n\nwhere the conditional probability \u03c1(x, t|\u03b1) to find the system in the continuous state x \u2208\nD\u03b1 (t) is given by\n\n\u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x, t)\n\u03c10 (x, t)\n(34)\nn\u03b1 (t)\nSimilarly, one finds for the correlation of two functions f (x) and g(x) at times t and t + \u03c4\n\u03c1(x, t|\u03b1) =\n\nbeing separated by a positive time \u03c4 that is long compared to the fast time scale of relaxations\nwithin the domains of attraction the following expression:\nX\nhf (t + \u03c4 )g(t)i =\nhf (t + \u03c4 )|\u03b1i hg(t)|\u03b1\u2032i p(\u03b1, t + \u03c4 |\u03b1\u2032 , t) p\u03b1\u2032 (t).\n\n(35)\n\n\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\n\nHere p(\u03b1, t + \u03c4 |\u03b1\u2032 , t) is the conditional probability to find the system in the metastable state\n\n\u03b1 at time t + \u03c4 provided it was in the state \u03b1\u2032 at the earlier time time t. This conditional\nprobability is the solution of the master equation (31) subject to the initial conditions\n\np(\u03b1, t|\u03b1\u2032, t) = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032 . Eq. (35) holds for arbitrary functions f (x) and g(x). Therefore the\nconditional probability of finding the system at time t + \u03c4 at the continuous state x if it was\nat the earlier time t at y takes the form\nX\n\u03c1(x, t + \u03c4 |\u03b1) \u03c7\u03b1\u2032 (y, t) p(\u03b1, t + \u03c4 |\u03b1\u2032 , t).\n\u03c1(x, t + \u03c4 |y, t) =\n\u03b1,\u03b1\u2032\n\n12\n\n(36)\n\n\fFor an independent derivation of this result see the Appendix A.\nYet another analogous way exists to characterize the continuous process on the long time\nscale: One takes the discrete process z(t) assuming the values \u03b1 = 1 . . . m according to\nthe master equation (31) and decorates the states with a random point in the state space,\nX(z(t), t), depending on time and the particular state \u03b1 = z(t) that is realized at the time t.\nIf the probability density of the decoration X(\u03b1, t) is chosen as the conditional probability\ndensity \u03c1(x, t|\u03b1) given in eq. (34) the mean values and the correlation functions of the\nprocess X(x, t) coincide with the expressions (32) and (35), respectively, and accordingly\nare characterized by the conditional probability (36). The decorated process is Markovian\nand has the same single and two time probability density as the continuous process x(t) on\nthe long time scale and hence coincides there with it:\nx(t) = X(z(t), t)\n\nV.\n\n(37)\n\nBISTABLE OVERDAMPED OSCILLATOR\n\nWe here consider the example of an overdamped bistable Brownian oscillator that is\nperiodically driven at a frequency \u03a9 which is slow compared to the typical relaxation rates.\nIts dynamics is given by the Smoluchowski operator\n2\n\u2202 \u2202V (x, t)\n\u22121 \u2202\nLS (t) =\n+\u03b2\n\u2202x \u2202x\n\u2202x2\n\n(38)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u22121 is the noise strength which is proportional to the temperature \u03b8 of the fluid\nsurrounding the oscillator, and V (x, t) denotes the time-dependent potential:\n1\n1\nV (x, t) = x4 \u2212 x2 \u2212 Ax sin(\u03a9t).\n4\n2\n\n(39)\n\nHere A denotes the strength of the periodic force. Throughout dimensionless units are used.\np\nIt is supposed to stay within the limits |A| < 2/(3 3). Actually it must keep some finite\n\ndistance from these limits in order that the following asymptotic theory applies. Under this\ncondition on the strength of the external force, the potential has three stationary points\nthat are solutions of the algebraic equation:\nx3 \u2212 x = A sin(\u03a9t)\n\n(40)\n\nAs time varies they form three branches: x1 (t) and x2 (t) are those tracing the two local\nminima that at t = 0 assume the values x1 (0) = \u22121 and x2 (0) = 1, respectively, and xb (t)\n13\n\n\fgives the location of the local potential maximum between the minima. At t = 0 it is located\nat xb (0) = 0.

The remaining \u03a9-dependence may be absorbed in a rescaled time \u03c4 = \u03a9t. An analytic\nsolution of the integral in eq. (55) is not known. In Fig. 2 the error divided by the driving\nfrequency is shown as it results from a numerical evaluation for different values of the driving\nstrength A and inverse temperature as a function of time. Both increasing driving strength\nA and inverse temperature \u03b2 lead to an increase of the extrema of the error that must be\ncompensated by a smaller driving frequency in order that the master equation with the\ninstantaneous rates provides a valid description.\nAs an average measure we introduce the root mean square error E =\n\n\u0010R\n\nT\n0\n\ndt\u01eb2 (t)/T\n\n\u00111/2\n\nwhich is strictly proportional to the driving frequency \u03a9. The proportionality factor E/\u03a9\nincreases as a function of the inverse temperature first as a power law and changes to an\nexponential growth for large values of \u03b2, see Fig 3.\nWe propose the following physical explanation of this effect: At large \u03b2 the noise is very\nsmall such that a particle that has reached at some time the top of the barrier has a very\nsmall chance to be pushed to either side by the noise. During the same time when it resides\nthere, the potential moves such that the particle no longer will sit on top of the barrier.\nDepending on the direction of the motion of the potential the particle may now be on the\nopposite side of the barrier or on the original side where it came from. In the former case\nthe geometric correction leads to an increase of the rate and in the latter case to a decrease\nof the transition rate. Because it then has again to overcome a barrier the increase of the\nrate is exponentially large in the inverse temperature.\n16\n\n\f6\n\n6\n(a)\n\nA = 0.15\n\n90\n\n\u03b2 = 60\n\n(b)\n\n60\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n4\n0.1\n\n30\n2\n\n2\n\u03b5(\u03c4)/\u03a9\n\n\u03b5(\u03c4)/\u03a9\n\n0.15\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20132\n\n\u20134\n\n\u20134\n\u20136\n\n\u20136\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n1\n\n6\n\n2\n\n3\n\u03c4\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFIG. 2: The relative error of the rate oscillates as a function of time \u03c4 = \u03a9t.

For example in symmetric systems with varying barrier height the\ndeviation only grows with the square root of the inverse temperature rather than exponential\nas in the above case where both the location and the height of the barrier changes in time.\n\nB.\n\nAverage motion\n\nWe have projected the dynamics of a a process with multiple metastable states and\nslowly time dependent parameters onto the slow subspace defined by the eigenfunctions of\nFokker-Planck operator\nAs a simple example of the decoration of the two metastable states we come back to the\n\n1\n48\n\n<x(t)>\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n35\n\n75\n\n\u20130.5\n\n\u20131\n\u20130.04\n\n\u20130.02\n\n0\nF(t)\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\nFIG. 4: The response of the average position on the driving force for the driving strength A = 0.05\nand driving frequency \u03a9 = 10\u22125 strongly depends on the magnitude of the noise. For \u03b2 = 35\nthe noise is relatively large such that the average position closely follows its adiabatic value and\ntherefore shows almost no hysteresis; for \u03b2 = 48 it stays behind the force, and for \u03b2 = 75 it is\nhardly influenced by the force. The hysteresis curves are traced in the mathematically positive\nsense.\n\n18\n\n\fbistable oscillator and consider the asymptotic motion of its average position. From eq.

The\nprobabilities p\u03b1 (t) follow as the asymptotic solutions of the master equation:\nRT\n\nds e(K(T )\u2212K(s)) r1,2 (t) \u2212K(t)\ne\n+\np1 (t) =\n1 \u2212 eK(T )\np2 (t) = 1 \u2212 p2 (t)\n0\n\nwhere\nK(t) =\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\nt\n\nds e\u2212(K(t)\u2212K(s)) r1,2 (s)\n\n0\n\n(58)\n\nt\n\nds (r1,2 (t) + r2,1 (t))\n\n(59)\n\n0\n\nRather than considering the time dependence we here show in Fig. 4 the dependence of\nthe position on the driving force F (t) = A cos(\u03a9t). In general the position lacks behind the\nforce and therefore the dependence is hysteretic. Only if the driving is either very slow or\nvery fast compared to the average rates there is no hysteretic behavior. In the slow case\nmany transitions occur before a change of the potential becomes sensible. The asymptotic\nprobabilities p\u03b1 (t) take the form of the stationary probabilities for the frozen rates. They\nthen depend on the force but not on its rate of change. In the opposite limit the asymptotic\nprobabilities see only the average rates and hence are time independent.\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper we studied the dynamics of externally driven systems with multiple\nmetastable states in the semiadiabatic limit. The full dynamics of the system comprising the fast and the slow time scales of the intrawell relaxations and of the external driving\nas well as of the transitions between the metastable states, respectively, is supposed to be\nMarkovian and continuous and, hence, described by a Fokker-Planck equation. We showed\n19\n\n\fthat the long time dynamics of this Fokker-Planck equation is equivalent to the dynamics\nof the master equation for the transitions between the discrete metastable states. The rates\nthat determine this master equation are time dependent taking values as if the parameters\nwere frozen at their instantaneous values. This kind of kinetic description is not new and\nhas long been used in the literature [13, 22]. The present work, however, provides three\nnew aspects. First the master equation does not result from an educated guess. It rather\nis obtained as the result of the projection of the dynamics onto the slow subspace of the\nFokker-Planck equation. This systematic approach additionally gives a quantitative criterion when deviations from the master equation with frozen rates must be expected. This\ncriterion does explicitly take into account the time change of the parameters and in contrast\nto other works [11] is not based on a comparison of time scales of the frozen dynamics with\nthe rate of change of the parameters. As a particular result we found for the dynamics of\na periodically driven overdamped Brownian oscillator that the maximal driving frequency\ndepends on the noise strength and decreases with decreasing noise strength. Asymptotically\nthis dependence even is exponential. Future work still has to show whether one can achieve\nan improvement of the dynamics if the so called geometric corrections to the rates are taken\ninto account in cases when the time scale separation between the fast intrawell relaxation\nand the changes of the parameters becomes less pronounced. The third main outcome of\nthe present approach is a partial retrieval of the underlying dynamics of the continuous variables by means of a proper decoration of the discrete states with time dependent random\nvariables.\nThe necessary time scale separation forced us to exclude the occurrence of bifurcations\nof the deterministic dynamics caused by the change of the parameters. Such bifurcations\nare accompanied by a slowing down of the deterministic dynamics and at the same time by\na lowering of a barrier height and consequently by a decreasing time scale of transitions.\nHence, for time dependent parameters, the time scale separation between interwell and\nintrawell dynamics is violated within a time window around the instant of bifurcation. It\nseems plausible that it should be possible to cut out this time window and to bridge it\nby some connection condition for the probabilities of those states that are involved in the\nbifurcation.\nApart from the separation of the time scales, another assumption was made in the present\nwork. First, we assumed that for fixed values of the parameters the system reaches a state of\n20\n\n\fthermal equilibrium and hence it obeys detailed balance. We think that this assumption is\nnot really essential for our results but it simplifies the analysis considerably. Without detailed\nbalance more general limit sets of the dynamics can occur apart from limit points such as\nlimit cycles and chaotic states. In general, the stationary densities are not known in absence\nof detailed balance, the weak noise asymptotics is plagued by notorious nonanalyticities\n[23], and rather little is known about transition rates in nonequilibrium systems. On the\nother hand there are many important systems that are driven out of equilibrium by time\ndependent parameters.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Igor Goychuk, Peter H\u00e4nggi, Sigmund Kohler, Marcin Kostur and\nMichael Schindler for valuable discussions and hints.

One therefore can write:\n\u03c1(x, t + \u03c4 |y, t) =\n\nX\n\u03b2,\u03b2 \u2032\n\nd(\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032; t, \u03c4 )\u03c1(x, t + \u03c4 |\u03b2)\u03c7\u03b2 \u2032 (y, t)\n\n(A1)\n\nwhere we expressed the basis function \u03c7\u0303\u03b1 (x, t + \u03c4 )\u03c10 (x, t + \u03c4 ) by \u03c1(x, t + \u03c4 |\u03b1)n\u03b1 (t + \u03c4 ),\n\nsee eq. (34) and introduced the yet undetermined coefficients d(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032; t, \u03c4 ) into which the\n\ntime dependent factor n\u03b1 (t) is absorbed. We now multiply the conditional probability of\nthe continuous process \u03c1(x, t + \u03c4 |y, t) with \u03c1(y, t|\u03b1\u2032), integrate over the domain of attraction\n\nD\u03b1 (t+\u03c4 ) and obtain the conditional probability of the discrete process p(\u03b1, t+\u03c4 |\u03b1\u2032 , t). Using\n\nthe ansatz (A1) for \u03c1(x, t+\u03c4 |t) we then find for the coefficients d(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032; t, \u03c4 ) = p(\u03b1, t+\u03c4 |, \u03b1\u2032, t).\n\nTogether with eq.
