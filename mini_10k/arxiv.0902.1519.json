Although resistivity measurements show\ntraces of superconductivity near 14 K for all x except x=1, only crystals grown with\ncompositions near x=0.5 exhibit bulk superconductivity. The appearance of bulk\nsuperconductivity correlates with a reduction in the magnitude of the magnetic\nsusceptibility at room temperature and smaller values of y, the concentration of Fe in the\nFe(2) site.\nI. Introduction\nThe initial discovery1 of superconductivity at 26 K in fluorine doped samples of\nLaFeAsO was a surprise since most Fe compounds are magnetic. Within a month of the\ninitial report the transition temperature was raised to as high as 55 K by replacing La with\nother rare earths such as Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm or Gd. 2-6 Within five months three other crystal\nstructure types of layered Fe compounds were found to be superconducting, including\nBa1-xKxFe2As27, Li1-xFeAs8, and FeSe9. The common feature of all four tetragonal crystal\nstructures is square planar sheets of Fe in a tetrahedral environment, with a formal\nvalence of Fe+2. Although there are structural similarities with the cuprates,\nsuperconductivity in the Fe based superconductors appears to arise from the suppression\nof a metallic magnetic ground state rather than from doping an antiferromagnetic Mott\ninsulator. The itinerant spin-density-wave (SDW) transition in the parent compounds of\nthe Fe based superconductors has several similarities with the SDW transition in Cr metal\nsuch as a magnetic susceptibility that increases with increasing temperature above TSDW\nand a small ordered magnetic moment.10\nSuperconductivity was first reported in polycrystalline FeSe at 8 K9, followed by pressure\nstudies that indicated a superconducting onset temperature near 27 K for a modest\npressure of 15 kbar11. Although the initial reports indicated superconductivity only in offstochiometric FeSe0.82 material, careful recent studies indicate that bulk superconductivity\n(i.e. a substantial heat capacity anomaly near Tc) only occurs for nearly stochiometric\nFeSe.12 The superconducting tetragonal phase of FeSe only forms in a narrow\ntemperature (300 \u00b0C \u2013 440 \u00b0C) and composition window (x =1.01-1.025). 12 This extreme\nsensitivity to synthesis conditions makes the growth of large single crystals of FeSe\ndifficult. Fe1+yTe, however forms in the same tetragonal structure but with 0.06 < y <\n\n1\n\n\f0.1713 and can be prepared as large single crystals from the melt14, 15. The excess Fe\npartially occupies the Fe(2) site in the crystal structure (Fig 1a) in between the square\nplanar sheets of Fe. Both experiment16, 17 and theory18 indicate that Fe in the Fe(2) site\nhas a local magnetic moment. The interaction between the Fe(2) iron and the more\nmetallic iron in the Fe(1) layer leads to a complicated magnetic structure16,17 for Fe1.06Te\nbelow TN = 65 K. Theory also suggests that if y = 0, spin-fluctuation mediated\nsuperconductivity should be stronger in FeTe than FeSe.19 Resistivity measurements on\npolycrystalline alloys20 of Fe1+yTexSe1-x and one single crystal investigation15 of\nFe1.03Te0.7Se0.3 give hints of superconductivity with transition temperatures approaching\n14 K, but often the resistance does not reach zero, and the magnetic susceptibility\nscreening signal (zfc) is small and does not become negative.\nIn the present work, we report on the growth and characterization of large single crystals\n(typical mass about 10 g) of Fe1+yTexSe1-x, with y as small as allowed by phase stability,\nand x= 1, 0.9, 0.75, 0.67, 0.55 and 0.5. We find hints of superconductivity for x = 0.9,\n0.75, and 0.67, a strong diamagnetic screening signal for x=0.55, and clear evidence of\nbulk superconductivity for x=0.5.\nII. Experimental Details\nAppropriate amounts of Fe pieces (99.99 wt. %), Te shot (99.9999 wt. %) and Se shot\n(99.9999 wt. %) were loaded into a silica Bridgeman ampoule, evacuated, and sealed.\nThe elements were melted together at 1070 C for 36 h and then cooled in a temperature\ngradient at rates ranging from 3 to 6 C/h to temperatures ranging from 350-750 C,\nfollowed by furnace cooling. Since the silica ampoules often cracked upon cooling, the\nBridgeman ampoule was sealed into a second silica ampoule. The starting stochiometry\nfor all of the growths except Fe1.06Te was FeTexSe1-x (no excess iron). Typically over half\nof the resulting boule was a single crystal. All of the crystals could be easily cleaved\nperpendicular to the c axis (Fig 1b, Fig 1c). The phase purity of the crystals were\ncharacterized using a Scintag XDS 2000 powder x-ray diffractometer and the chemical\ncomposition was measured with a JEOL JSM 840 scanning electron microscope\nequipped with an EDAX analysis system. Single crystal X-ray diffraction data were\ncollected at room temperature on a STOE IPDSII diffractometer using MoK! radiation.\nTransport and heat capacity measurements were performed with a Quantum Design\nPhysical Property Measurement System (PPMS). Electrical leads were attached to the\nsamples using Dupont 4929 silver paste. Magnetic measurements were performed with a\nQuantum Design (MMPS) SQUID magnetometer.\nIII. Results and Discussion\nTypical powder x-ray diffraction data from some of the crystals (Fe1+yTexSe1-x, x= 1,\n0.75, 0.67, 0.55, and 0.5) are shown in Fig 2a. All of the patterns are described by the\ntetragonal PbO structure type with the lattice constants given in Table 1. For the x=0.5\nboule, the average composition separates into two tetragonal phases with the tetragonal\nPbO structure. This separation is evident in the splitting of the (001) line for the x=0.5\n\n2\n\n\fcomposition (Fig 2b). EDAX analysis of different portions of the x=0.5 boule indicate\nmacroscopic stripes (0.1 mm wide stripes) of two phases with approximate compositions\nof FeTe0.53Se0.47 (major phase) and FeTe0.35Se0.65 (minor phase). A similar phase\nseparation has been reported in polycrystalline samples20, 21 near this composition range.\nIn spite of the phase separation, neutron diffraction analysis shows that the x=0.5 boule is\nessentially a single crystal.22 Subsequent growth experiments have determined that the\nphase separation observed in the FeTe0.5Se0.5 crystal boules can be greatly suppressed or\nperhaps eliminated using longer soak times at high temperatures. Initial superconducting\nmeasurements on these more homogenous samples, however, are virtually identical to the\nresults reported here for the phase separated FeTe0.5Se0.5 crystal. EDAX and single\ncrystal refinement analyses of the other crystals Fe1+yTexSe1-x (x=1, 0.9, 0.75, 0.67, 0.55)\nindicate that the Te and Se concentrations are very close to the starting nominal\ncomposition. The measured values of y, however, monotonically decrease from y= 0.13 \u00b1\n0.02 for x=1, to y = 0 \u00b1 0.02 for x=0.5 (Table 1).\nResistivity data with the current in the ab plane are shown in Fig. 3 for crystals cleaved\nfrom large boules such as shown in Fig 1. Crystals with 0.5 < x < 0.9 all show indications\nof superconductivity with an onset drop in the resistivity near 14 K except the crystal\nwith x=0.9 where Tc onset is near 10 K. Note, however, that the resistivity does not reach\nzero for several of the crystals (x= 0.9, 0.75, 0.67), The smooth drop in the resistivity of\nFe1.12Te0.9Se0.1 near 35 K is most likely the magnetic/structural transition16, 17 that occurs\nat 65 K in Fe1.13Te crystals (see Fig 6). The resistivity of Fe1.13Te is very similar to that\nreported by several authors.15, 16\nThe magnetic susceptibility at 20 Oe is shown for the x=0.5 crystal (Fig. 4) for both zero\nfield cooled (zfc) and field cooled (fc) measuring conditions, as well as the resistivity\ndata from the same piece. The resistivity reaches zero at about 14 K, consistent with the\nonset of a large diamagnetic screening signal that reaches full screening (-1/4\") at 4 K.\nOnly the x=0.55 crystal displayed an equally strong diamagnetic signal expected from a\nbulk superconductor. The zfc low field susceptibility from the other compositions (x=\n0.9, 0.75, 0.67) remained paramagnetic below Tc.\nLow temperature heat capacity measurements were performed on several Fe1+yTexSe1-x\ncrystals with x = 0.67, 0.55 and 0.5 to check for bulk superconductivity. Only the piece\nfrom the x=0.5 boule shows a clear heat capacity anomaly at Tc ! 14 K. There is a small\nheat capacity anomaly near Tc for the x=0.55 sample, but it is not easily visible when the\ndata are plotted on the same scale. The heat capacity data from the x=0.67 crystal shows\nno evidence of superconductivity and for T< 20 K the data can be accurately described by\n#T + BT3 + CT5, with # = 39 mj/mole/K2, and $D = 174 K. To get an approximate\nestimate of the electronic contribution to the heat capacity data from the x = 0.5 sample,\nthe data from the x=0.5 and x=0.55 samples were scaled by a few percent to match the\ndata from the x=0.67 sample at 20 K (Fig 5a). The lattice contribution (BT3 + CT5) from\nthe x=0.67 crystal was then subtracted from the x=0.5 data with the result shown in Fig\n5b. Although there is likely a difference in # and the lattice heat capacity between the\nx=0.67 and x=0.5 compositions, the general shape and magnitude of the data displayed in\nFig 5b is typical of a bulk superconducting transition. The activated behavior between 2\nand 10 K can be fit to the BCS formula23 with a gap of about 1.3 kBTc somewhat smaller\n\n3\n\n\fthan the expected value of 1.76 kBTc. We note, however, that not all pieces from the same\nx=0.5 boule exhibited a clear heat capacity anomaly at Tc, indicating that these materials\nare extremely sensitive to the exact synthesis conditions. This sensitivity was also\nemphasized in studies of the preparation of polycrystalline FeSe.12 For FeSe the\nsuperconductivity was severely depressed with a small concentration of Fe in the Fe (2)\nsite. This is perhaps not surprising since theory indicates that Fe in the Fe (2) should have\na local magnetic moment and hence act as a pair breaker. The value of y, the amount of\nFe in the Fe(2) site, decreases for decreasing values of x (Table 1). The high temperature\nmagnetic susceptibility, %, data from the Fe1+y TexSe1-x, crystals also suggest that y\ndecreases with decreasing x (more Se) (Fig 6). As the Se content is increased the\nmagnitude of the room temperature susceptibility monotonically decreases from 3.5 x 103\ncm3/mole Fe for x=1 to 1.1 x 10-3 cm3/mole Fe for x = 0.5. The room temperature value\nof % for other Fe based superconductors such as LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 or Ba(Fe1.84Co0.16)As2,\nis typically between 2 - 5 x 10-4 cm3/mole. If the occupation of the Fe(2) site can be\nlowered further through modification of the Fe1+yTexSe1-x crystal growth parameters or\nchemical substitution with a nonmagnetic element, even better superconducting\nproperties could result.\nIV. Summary\nLarge single crystals of Fe1+yTexSe1-x with x= 1, 0.9, 0.75, 0.67, 0.55, 0.5 and 0 < y <\n0.15 were grown using a modified Bridgeman method. Only crystals with x values near\n0.5 exhibited bulk superconductivity as evident from resistivity, magnetic susceptibility\nand heat capacity measurements. The appearance of bulk superconductivity correlates\nwith smaller values of y and the suppression of a magnetic/structural transition between\nx=0.9 and x=0.75. Relatively large superconducting crystals of these compounds are of\ninterest for neutron scattering and elastic constant experiments aimed at probing the\nrelationship between magnetism, magnetic fluctuations, phonons and superconductivity.\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to acknowledge enlightening discussions with David Singh, Mark\nLumsden, Andrew Christianson, Steve Nagler and Herb Mook as well as the technical\nassistance of Larry McCollum, Jason Craig, Elder Mellon and Midge Mckinney.

The\nlattice constants are determined from single crystal x-ray refinement or from\n(parentheses) full powder x-ray diffraction patterns using LeBail refinements and the\nprogram \"FullProf\". The differences in composition and lattice constants for crystals\nprepared from FeTe0.5Se0.5 melts reflects the spatial variations of the Te/Se ratios typically\nfound in the resulting boule.\n\nStarting Melt\nComposition\nFe1.06Te\nFeTe0.9Se0.1\nFeTe0.75Se0.25\nFeTe0.67Se0.33\nFeTe0.55Se0.45\nFeTe0.5Se0.50\n\nMicroprobe\nComposition\n(\u00b1 0.02)\nFe1.13Te\nFe1.12Te0.92Se0.08\nFe1.04Te0.73Se0.27\nFe1.04Te0.64Se0.36\nFe1.01Te0.54Se046\nFe0.99Te0.51Se0.49\n\nSingle Crystal\nRefined Comp.\n\nc (\u00c5)\n\na(\u00c5)\n\nFe1.07Te\nFe1.08Te0.93Se0.07\n\n6.284 (6.288)\n6.248 (6.246)\n(6.163)\n6.118 (6.109)\n(6.050)\n6.069 (6.034)\n\n3.823 (3.820)\n3.815 (3.813)\n(3.809)\n3.803 (3.805)\n(3.798)\n3.815 (3.801)\n\nFe1.06Te0.68Se0.32\nFe1.00Te54Se46\n\n7\n\n\fFig 1a (Color online) Schematic of tetragonal Fe1+yTexSe1+x structure. The structure\nconsists of square planar layers of iron (small spheres) and planar layers of Te/Se (large\nspheres). In most of the crystals a few percent of Fe (medium size spheres) occupies sites\nin the Se/Te layers.\n\nFig 1b (Color online) Single crystal boule of Fe1.13Te0.73Se0.27 cleaved in half with a razor\nblade.

The heat capacity data from the x= 0.5 and x=0.55 crystals have\nbeen adjusted by a few percent to match the x=0.67 data at T = 20 K. The heat capacity\ndata for the x=0.67 sample are well described by #T + BT3 + CT5, with # = 39 mj/moleK2 and $D = 174 K. These data were used to subtract the lattice contribution from the\nx=0.5 data.\n\nFig. 5b. (Color online) Estimation of the electronic contribution to the heat capacity of a\nFeTe0.5Se0.5 crystal near and below Tc ! 14 K. This crystal clearly shows bulk\nsuperconductivity. Analysis of the data (line) between 2 and 10 K indicate a value for the\ngap & ! 1.3 kBTc , some what smaller than the expected BCS value of 1.76.\n\n14\n\n\fFig.6. (Color online) Magnetic susceptibility of FeTexSe1-x crystals with H = 0.1 T and H\nperpendicular to the c axis. Except for the x=0.55 and x=0.5 crystals below the\nsuperconducting transition temperatures, the M vs H curves (not shown) are linear from 0\nto 7 T. Note that the room temperature susceptibility monotonically decreases with\ndecreasing x.\n\n15\n\n\f"}
