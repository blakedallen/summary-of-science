We employ the concept of the polarization\nmode instability and demonstrate simultaneous switching and amplification of\na weak signal by a strong pump of the other polarization.\nc 2018 Optical Society of America\nOCIS codes: 190.0190, 190.4370, 190.5530.\n\n1\n\n\f1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDiscrete spatial solitons are usually introduced as spatially localized nonlinear modes of\nweakly coupled optical waveguides1 , and they have recently been observed experimentally\nin different nonlinear systems2 . A standard theoretical approach in the study of discrete\nspatial optical solitons is based on the derivation of an effective discrete nonlinear model\nand the analysis of its stationary localized solutions-discrete localized modes3 .\nMany studies analyzed both propagation and steering of scalar discrete solitons in nonlinear waveguide arrays, including trapping, reflection, and refraction of an incoming discrete\nsoliton in an array with defects4 . For waveguide arrays with quadratic nonlinear response,\nPertsch et al.5 suggested an optical switching scheme where a low-power diffractionless beam\nis coupled parametrically to a pump, resulting in generation of a strong idler beam. Recently, we suggested6 to control multi-port switching of discrete solitons in waveguide arrays\nby engineering the coupling between the neighboring waveguides: this induces a change\nof the dynamic properties of the array through the modification of the effective PeierlsNabarro (PN) potential , a nonlinear discreteness-induced potential that is responsible for\nthe transverse dynamics of discrete solitons in a waveguide array.\nIn materials with a nonlinear cubic response, we expect a very rich nonlinear dynamics\nand coupling between different modes. In particular, coupling between the waves of two\northogonal polarizations can result in the formation of a vector soliton. Vector solitons can be\nemployed for different schemes of all-optical switching schemes, e.g. by employing collisions\nbetween orthogonally polarized solitons without7 or with8 four-wave mixing (FWM) effects.\nThe FMW effect is responsible for the energy exchange between the two (TE and TM)\npolarizations. In planar waveguides, the TE mode is known as 'slow', while the TM mode\u2013\nas 'fast', because the TE mode has larger propagation constant. Interaction between the\n2\n\n\fTE and TM modes is known to lead to polarization mode instability9 , so that the TM mode\nis always unstable with respect to the TE mode. This implies that the fast mode transfers\nthe energy to the slow mode.\nThe theory of discrete vector solitons developed so far does not include the analysis of\nthe FWM effects (as an example, see Ref. 10). However, the first experimental studies of\nthe vectorial interactions and discrete vector solitons in waveguide arrays11 due to coupling\nbetween two orthogonally polarized modes, suggest the importance of the FWM effects\ndemonstrating that the initial phase between the TE and TM modes defines the energy\nexchange between the modes.\nIn this Letter, we study numerically the dynamics and switching properties of discrete\nvector solitons employing the concept of polarization mode instability. We demonstrate an\neffective switching, control, and amplification of a weak signal by a strong pump of the\northogonal polarization that can be useful for multi-port all-optical switching.\nIn order to analyze the polarization effects for discrete solitons, we consider a model of\nbirefringent cubic nonlinear waveguide arrays recently fabricated experimentally11 , described\nby the coupled-mode theory within the slowly varying envelope approximation:\ndan\n= Vn+ {an } + |an |2 an + A|bn |2 an + Bb2n a\u2217n\ndz\ndbn\n\u2212i\n= Vn\u2212 {bn } + |bn |2 bn + A|an |2 bn + Ba2n b\u2217n ,\ndz\n\n\u2212i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Vn\u00b1 {an } = \u00b1an + V (an+1 + an\u22121 ), an and bn are the normalized envelopes of the TEand TM-polarized components of the electric field, respectively, z stands for the propagation\ndistance, V is the coupling parameter assumed to be the same for both polarizations (both\nmodes have the similar transverse extensions). Nonlinear coefficients A and B characterize\nthe cross-phase-modulation and the FWM effects (weighted with the self-focusing term),\n\n3\n\n\frespectively. In our study, we use the experimental parameters of this model as defined in\nRef. 11, i.e. A = 1, B = 0.5, and V = 0.92. The normalized power,\nP = Pa + Pb =\n\nX\nn\n\nand Hamiltonian, H = \u2212\n\nP\n\na\nn (Hn\n\n(|an |2 + |bn |2 ),\n\n(2)\n\n+ Hnb + Hnab ), where\n\n1\nHna,b = \u00b1|an |2 + V (a\u2217n an+1 + an a\u2217n+1 ) + |an |4 ,\n2\nB\n2 \u22172\nHnab = |an |2 |bn |2 + (b2n a\u22172\nn + an bn )\n2\n\n(3)\n\nare conserved in the dynamics, and they both play an important role for checking numerical\naccuracy and for estimation of the realistic power of the switching-amplification process\n(e.g., Preal \u2248 56 \u00d7 P [W ] in the AlGaAs waveguide array used in Ref. 11).\nAn important step of our analysis is a choice of the appropriate initial profiles for both\nmodes. Since the exact solution to Eq. (1) is not known, we select a truncated sech-like\nprofile6 :\n\u221a\nan (0) = a0 sech[a0 (n \u2212 nca )/ 2] e\u2212ika (n\u2212nca ) ei\u03c6a\n\n\u221a\nbn (0) = b0 sech[b0 (n \u2212 ncb )/ 2] e\u2212ikb (n\u2212ncb ) ei\u03c6b ,\n\n(4)\n\nfor n \u2212 nca = n \u2212 ncb = 0, \u00b11, and an (0) = bn (0) = 0, otherwise. Parameters a0 and b0 are\nthe initial amplitudes, ka and kb are the initial kicks (transverse angles), nca and ncb are the\ninitial center positions, and \u03c6a and \u03c6b are the input phases, for both TE and TM modes,\nrespectively. As has been verified earlier6 , this ansatz provides a very good agreement in the\nscalar case, when just one mode propagates in the array. A specific choice of the initial input\nis not a restriction to our analysis, because a discrete soliton is a self-adjusting mode, and\nan energy excess is emitted in the form of radiation modes9 . We have carried out numerical\nsimulations with other profiles, and the dynamic behavior was found to be similar.\n4\n\n\fIn the polarization-induced dynamics, a fast mode is unstable with respect to its transformation into a slow mode9,11 Numerically, we observe that we can invert this polarization instability with an appropriate use of the initial phase shift. When the initial phase\nshift is 0 or \u03c0 (linearly polarized), the TM mode always transfers a part of its energy to\nthe TE mode. On the other hand, if the initial phase shift is \u03c0/2 (elliptically polarized),\nwe observe a reversed effect. Thus, we can control the energy transfer by choosing the\ninitial phase shift between both modes at the input. In some cases, e.g. when we consider large propagation distances, the energy exchange can be complete. In this paper, we\nstudy the linearly polarized case only, because the maximum power gain for the TE mode,\n(Pa (zmax ) \u2212 Pa (0))/Pa (0), observed in this situation (\u223c 6000%) is higher than for the elliptically polarized case (\u223c 100%). This asymmetry in the polarization instability is a very\ninteresting feature, but here we are interested only in an efficient all-optical switching scheme\nbased on this effect.\nIn our numerical simulations, we take zmax = 50 and an array of 110 waveguides. We\nmade sweeps of the system parameters and observe the TE gain. On a phase diagram in\nFig. 1, we show the TE (signal) power gain vs. the TM (pump) mode input angle kb \u2013 the\nTM (pump) power content Pb (0) space, for a small TE initial power Pa (0) = 0.03 and zero\nangle ka = 0, and for initial linear polarization. The whiter region marks a high gain limit\n(up to 60 times), while the black region marks a low gain (0.7). As expected, the maximum\ngain is achieved when the angle of the pump is near zero, and when the amplitude to the\npump is the highest. In Fig. 2 (point \"A\" in Fig. 1), we show the longest switching case\n(13 sites) which is associated with a low power gain, \u223c 70%. In Fig. 3 (point \"B\" in Fig. 1),\nwe show a switching for 4 sites with a medium range power gain of \u223c 800%. In Fig. 4 (point\n\"C\" in Fig. 1), we show an example of strongly suppressed switching with a huge power\n5\n\n\fgain of \u223c 6.000%. It is very important to note that the TE signal has a very low power,\napproximately 1.7 W. Another important remark is that the TE signal has no initial kick.\nWith that, we want to be emphatic about the real possibilities of the implementation of our\nconcept. The idea suggested in Fig. 1, is that a very small unkicked signal arriving at the\nmiddle of the array can, as a consequence of the polarization mode instability, be amplified\nin any amount from 70% to 6000%, by judiciously choosing the pump (TM) input angle and\nthe pump power.\nThis effect is possible due to an interplay between two effects, the polarization instability\nand the array discreteness. The lower the input power, the lower is the PN barrier, and the\nlarger is the distance from the input waveguide that the soliton can propagate. Before the\nsoliton gets trapped, it loses part of its energy in the form of radiation modes, adjusting\nits profile to the discrete soliton mode corresponding to the output waveguide. Thus, for\na low power level (Fig. 2), discrete solitons will have more transversal mobility and will be\ntrapped in a waveguide located far from the input region. At high enough power level, the\nswitching will be at a near (Fig. 3) or null (Fig. 4) distance from the input waveguide.\nIn conclusion, we have suggested a novel multi-port amplifying/switching scheme, which\nuses the typical polarization instability property of vector solitons as well as the PN concept\ndue to the system discreteness.\nThe authors acknowledge a support from a Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica\ny Tecnol\u00f3gica and Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cientif\u00edco y Tecnol\u00f3gico.
