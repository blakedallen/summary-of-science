We have observed information cascades on the social media site Digg that spread fast enough for one initial\nspreader to infect hundreds of people, yet end up affecting\nonly 0.1% of the entire network. We find that two effects, previously studied in isolation, combine cooperatively to drastically limit the final size of cascades on Digg. First, because\nof the highly clustered structure of the Digg network, most\npeople who are aware of a story have been exposed to it via\nmultiple friends. This structure lowers the epidemic threshold while moderately slowing the overall growth of cascades.\nIn addition, we find that the mechanism for social contagion\non Digg points to a fundamental difference between information spread and other contagion processes: despite multiple\nopportunities for infection within a social group, people are\nless likely to become spreaders of information with repeated\nexposure. The consequences of this mechanism become more\npronounced for more clustered graphs. Ultimately, this effect\nseverely curtails the size of social epidemics on Digg.\n\nIntroduction\nMany diverse phenomena can be modeled as contact processes, including adoption of new ideas (Rogers 2003;\nBettencourt et al. 2005), spread of infectious disease (Anderson and May 1991; Hethcote 2000) and behaviors (Christakis and Fowler 2007; Christakis and Fowler 2008), computer virus epidemics on the Internet (Castellano and PastorSatorras 2010), word-of-mouth recommendations (Goldenberg, Libai, and Muller 2001), viral marketing campaigns (Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos 2003; Iribarren and\nMoro 2009), and information cascades in online social networks (Lerman and Ghosh 2010). A contact process is simply a diffusion of activation on a graph, where each activated, or \"infected,\" node can infect its neighbors with\nsome probability given by the transmissibility. Given\ntheir prevalence, contact processes and the effect of network topology on their dynamics have been widely studied.\nOne of the more important results is the existence of an epidemic threshold (Wang et al. 2003; Prakash et al. 2010;\nCopyright c 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial\nIntelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\n\nChakrabarti et al. 2008; Castellano and Pastor-Satorras\n2010), i.e., the critical value of transmissibility above which\nlarge number of nodes in the graph are eventually infected. In graphs with power-law degree distribution, a\ncommon property of social networks (Amaral et al. 2000),\nlarge degree heterogeneity speeds up epidemics (Barrat,\nBarth\u00e9lemy, and Vespignani 2008; Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005),\nresulting in the vanishing epidemic threshold in the limit of\nvery large graphs (Satorras and Vespignani 2001). This result has alarming implications for propagation of viruses in\nhuman populations and computer networks: any outbreak,\neven one that is not very virulent, will spread to infect large\nnumber of nodes.\nUntil recently, obtaining empirical data to study contact\nprocesses involved laborious surveys (Valente 2010) and\ncontact traces (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005; Christakis and\nFowler 2007; Christakis and Fowler 2008), which made\nanalysis of their statistical properties impractical. The proliferation of online social networks on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Digg, where users explicitly declare social links and actively spread information, gives us a unique\nopportunity to quantitatively study dynamics of contact processes. We collected data from the social news aggregator Digg detailing how interest in more than 3,500 stories\nspreads through Digg's social network (Lerman and Ghosh\n2010). A user becomes inf ected by digging (i.e., voting\nfor) a story and exposes her network neighbors to it. Each\nneighbor may in turn become infected (i.e., vote), exposing\nher own neighbors to it, and so on. This way interest in a\nstory cascades through Digg's network.\nThis data enables us to trace the flow of information along\nsocial links and quantitatively study dynamics of information spread on a network. We find that the vast majority\nof cascades grow far slower than expected from their initial spread and fail to reach \"epidemic\" proportions. To\nunderstand why, we simulate information cascades on the\nDigg graph and on a synthetic graph constructed to have\nsimilar properties. We compare results to theoretical predictions and properties of real cascades on Digg. We find\nthat while network structure somewhat limits the growth of\ncascades, a far more dramatic effect comes from the social\ncontagion mechanism. Unlike the standard cascade models\nused in previous works on the spread of epidemics, repeated\nexposure to the same story on Digg does not make the user\n\n\fmore likely to vote for it. Furthermore, this effect becomes\nquite significant due to the structure of the Digg graph which\nresults in repeated exposure for most users. While the effect of clusters on epidemics has been studied, and alternate contagion mechanisms on social networks have been\nobserved (Romero, Meeder, and Kleinberg 2011), no one\nhas studied their interaction and noticed that they constructively interfere to drastically limit epidemic size. We define\nan alternative cascade model that fits empirical observations\nand show that in simulation it reproduces the observed properties of real information cascades on Digg.\n\nInformation Cascades on Digg\nThe social news aggregator Digg (http://digg.com) is one of\nthe oldest and more popular social media sites. Digg allows\nusers to submit links to news stories and vote for, or digg,\nthem. There are multiple submissions every minute, many\nthousands a day. A newly submitted story goes to the upcoming stories list, where it remains for 24 hours, or until it\nis promoted to the front page. Digg selects about a hundred\nof these stories every day to feature on its front page. Although the exact promotion mechanism is secret, it appears\nto take into account the number and the rate at which story\nreceives votes.\nDigg also allows users to designate friends and track\ntheir activities. The friends interface shows stories a user's\nfriends recently submitted or voted for. The friendship graph\nis directed. When user j lists user i as a friend, j can watch\nthe activities of i but not vice versa. We call j the fan, or\nthe follower, of i. A newly submitted story is visible in the\nupcoming stories list, as well as to submitter's fans through\nthe friends interface. With each vote it also becomes visible\nto voter's fans. In the event that j has n friends who have\nvoted for a story, the story appears in their interface with a\ncolored badge with the number n emblazoned on it.\nWe used Digg API to collect data about 3,553 stories promoted to the front page in June 2009.1 The data associated\nwith each story contains story title, story id, link, submitter's name, submission time, list of voters and the time of\neach vote, the time the story was promoted to the front page.\nIn addition, we collected the list of voters' friends.\nWe define an active user as any user who voted for at least\none story on Digg during the data collection period. There\nwere 139,409 active users, of which 71,367 designated at\nleast one other user as a friend. We extracted the friends\nof these users and reconstructed the fan network of active\nusers, i.e., a directed graph of active users who are watching\nactivities of other users. There were 279,634 nodes in the\nfan network, with 1,731,658 links.\n\nDegree Distribution\nFigure 1(a) shows the distribution of the number of active\nfans per user. This distribution has a scale-free shape that is\ncommon to degree distributions of social and other complex\nnetworks (Amaral et al. 2000; Clauset, Shalizi, and New1\nThe data set is available at\nhttp://www.isi.edu/ \u0303 lerman/downloads/digg2009.html\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\nFigure 1: Properties of Digg: (a) Degree distribution of the\nfan network, (b) distribution of principal cascade size.\nman 2009) and is well described by a power law of the form\np(k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3 \u2248 2.\n\nCascade Size\nThe spread of a story through Digg's social network can be\ndescribed as a social contagion process where votes spread\nbetween friends on the network. As interest in a story\nspreads, it may generate many cascades from independent\nseeds. For each story, using the methodology proposed\nin (Ghosh and Lerman 2011), we extracted the cascade that\nstarts with the submitter and includes all voters who are connected to the submitter either directly or indirectly via the\nfans network. We call this the principal cascade of the story.\nFigure 1(b) shows the distribution of principal cascade sizes\nof stories in our sample. This distribution is well described\nby a log-normal function with the mean of 156. Note that\nmost of the cascades are smaller than 500, and only three\nare bigger than 1,000.\nA story will typically generate multiple, even hundreds\nof, cascades (Ghosh and Lerman 2011). Aggregating over\nall cascades gives the total story popularity. This quantity\nis well fit by a log-normal with the mean 614. Only 15 stories in our sample of 3,553 received more than 6,000 votes,\nand only one more than 9,000. The most popular story in\nour sample, and one that generated the biggest principal cascade, was about Michael Jackson's death. It received more\n\n\fthan 24,000 votes. The distribution of story popularity is remarkably similar to that obtained by Wu and Huberman (Wu\nand Huberman 2007) from a sample of over 30,000 stories promoted to Digg front page in 2006. In their sample,\nthe most common value of story popularity was around 500\nvotes (with a maximum around 4,000 votes).\n\nWhat Limits Cascades on Digg?\nThe observations above present a puzzle: why are information cascades on Digg so small? In our sample, only one\ncascade, about Michael Jackson's death, can be said to have\nreached epidemic proportions, i.e., reaching a significant\nfraction of active Digg users (in this case, about 5%). The\nmajority of the cascades for the remaining stories reached\nfewer than 0.1% of active Digg users. On the other hand,\nthe cascades did spread fast enough to infect hundreds of\nusers. This disparity becomes more striking in the next section where we show that typical epidemic models predict\nthat stories will reach an order of magnitude more voters\nthan we observe on Digg.\nThere are a number of factors that could explain why information cascades on Digg are so small. Perhaps Digg\nusers modulate transmissibility of stories and keep them\nsmall to prevent information overload. On the other hand,\ntransmissibility could diminish in time, either because of\nnovelty decay (Wu and Huberman 2007) or decrease in visibility of stories as new stories are submitted to Digg (Hogg\nand Lerman 2009). Perhaps the structure of the network\n(e.g., clustering or communities) limits the spread of information. Or it could be that the mechanism of social contagion, i.e., how people decide to vote for a story once their\nfriends vote for it, prevents stories from growing on Digg.\nIn addition, users are active at different times, and heterogeneity of their activity could be another explanation.\nIn this paper we examine some of these alternate hypotheses through simulations of contact processes on networks\nand empirical study of real cascades on Digg. Ultimately,\nwe are able to identify the factors that allow us to closely\nreproduce the observed behavior on Digg.\n\nAnalysis of Simulated and Real Cascades\nWe now proceed to describe two effects that interact synergistically to severely limit the size of cascades on Digg.\nFirst, due to the highly clustered structure of the Digg graph,\nmost nodes end up being exposed to a story multiple times,\neven while the story fails to propagate outside of a cluster.\nSecond, we observe that, contrary to many contagion models, repeated exposure to a story does not make a user more\nlikely to vote on it. We compare observed Digg cascades\nto simulations and theoretical results for standard models\nof spreading processes on graphs, highlighting the profound\nimpact these effects have on the final size of cascades.\n\nNetwork Structure\nA traditional measure of graph clustering like the (WattsStrogatz) clustering coefficient, which is based on the number of triangles in a graph, yields an unremarkable 0.0924\nfor the Digg graph. In practice, we find clustering effects\n\nFigure 2: For nodes who were exposed to a story, the average\nnumber of friends who voted on the story.\nto be far more pronounced than this measure suggests, potentially reflecting high variance of the clustering coefficient\nacross all nodes. For every node that sees a story from one of\nits friends, we count the total number of that node's friends\nwho voted on the story (or, if the node itself voted, the total number of friends who voted on the story before it did).\nThe distribution of this quantity in Figure 2 shows that a\nsolid majority of \u223c 63% of exposed users have more than\none friend voting on a story, with some having dozens of\ninfected friends. This is especially remarkable when one\nconsiders theoretical results that model social contagion as\nbranching processes, e.g., a Galton-Watson process (Iribarren and Moro 2009). That model assumes cascades spread\nin a tree-like fashion, so that each node has only one friend\nvoting before it.\n\nSimulations\nTo gauge the effect of graph structure on the spread of cascades, we construct a graph with the same number of nodes\nand require that each node has the same degree as its counterpart in the Digg graph. We used the directed configuration\nmodel from (Newman, Strogatz, and Watts 2001) to create\na random graph with a given degree sequence. This method\npreserves the degree distribution of the original Digg graph\nwhile destroying degree correlations and cluster structure in\nthe graph. By simulating cascade processes on the original\nand randomized network, we can measure the effect graph\nstructure has on cascade size.\nWe begin with an independent cascade model widely\nused to study diffusion processes on networks (Satorras\nand Vespignani 2001; Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos 2003;\nIribarren and Moro 2009). For later comparison we point\nout similarities to the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR)\nmodel in the epidemic literature (Hethcote 2000; Barrat,\nBarth\u00e9lemy, and Vespignani 2008). We start with a single\nseed node who has voted for a story. By analogy with epidemic processes, we call this node infected. The susceptible\nfans of the seed node decide to vote on the story with some\nprobability given by the transmissibility \u03bb. Since every node\ncan only vote for the story once, at this point, the seed node\nis removed, and we repeat the process with the newly in-\n\n\ffected nodes. Note that a node who is a fan of n voting\nnodes, has n independent chances to become infected, but\nin this model once a node votes on a story, it only has one\nchance to spread it to its fans before it is removed.2 Intuitively, this assumption implies that you are more likely to\nvote on a story if many of your friends vote on it.\nStarting with random seed node, we generated 100,000\ncascades using a transmissibility picked uniformly from the\nrange [0, 0.01] and 40,000 cascades with transmissibility\npicked uniformly from the range [0.01, 0.03]. Each time a\nnode is infected, it will infect each of its fans independently\nwith probability \u03bb. Additionally, we model the time between\nseeing a story and voting for it as a random variable pulled\nuniformly from some interval.\n\ngraph (Wang et al. 2003). For the original graph this gives\n\u03bbdigg\n= 0.00587, while for the randomized graph this gives\nc\n\u03bbrand\n= 0.00928.\nc\nAs we noted previously, this process should be accurately\nmodeled by the SIR model of epidemics. In the limit of large\ngraphs, if we assume that a node's behavior is defined by its\ndegree (with no degree correlations), we can calculate the\nexpected size of cascades using heterogeneous mean field\n(HMF) theory (Moreno, Pastor-Satorras, and Vespignani\n2002). Based on observations of the Digg network shown\nin Figure 1(a), we pick a degree distribution p(k) \u221d k \u22122 ,\nwith a cut-off on the maximum degree, kmax = 103 . This\nprediction is depicted with the gold line in Figure 3. Both the\nthreshold and growth accurately characterize the randomized graph. Note that HMF applies in the large graph limit.\nBecause the randomized graph is still finite, some clustering inevitably occurs (it has a clustering coefficient of about\n0.02), decreasing the cascade size from the HMF prediction.\n\nComparison of theory and simulation\n\nFigure 3: Cascade size as a function of transmissibility \u03bb for\nsimulated cascades on the Digg graph and the randomized\ngraph with the same degree distribution (see section on simulations). Heterogeneous mean field predicts cascade size as\na fraction of the nodes affected. The line (hmf) reports these\npredictions multiplied by the total number of nodes in the\nDigg network.\nAfter some time, no new nodes are infected, and the cascade stops. Because the graph is finite, the cascade is guaranteed to stop eventually. The final number of infected\nnodes gives cascade size. These are shown in Figure 3,\nwhere each point represents a single cascade with the y-axis\ngiving the final cascade size and the x-axis denotes the transmissibility \u03bb. We only keep cascades with more than 10 infected nodes (votes). Blue dots represent cascades on the\noriginal Digg graph while pink dots represent cascades on a\nrandomized version of the Digg graph. In both simulations,\nthere exists a critical value of \u03bb, the epidemic threshold, below which cascades quickly die out and above which they\nspread to a significant fraction of the graph. Note that even\nabove epidemic threshold, cascades that start in an isolated\nregion of the graph will die out.\n\nTheoretical results\nThe location of the epidemic threshold is accurately calculated for both the Digg and randomized graph using the inverse of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the\n2\nIn the epidemic literature this is equivalent to setting the recovery rate \u03bc = 1 and the infection rate \u03b2 = \u03bb.\n\nIf one assumes Digg's graph structure consists of dense\nclusters, the effects on cascades in the independent cascade\nmodel are quite intuitive. It is easier for a story to take\noff within a smaller, more tightly connected community,\nthereby lowering the epidemic threshold. This also explains\nwhy the majority of people exposed to story are exposed to\nit from multiple sources. On the other hand, for cascades\nto grow very large it is better to have a more homogeneous\nlink structure to reach all parts of the graph quickly. Ultimately, clusters have the effect of marginally decreasing the\nsize of cascades by sequestering an infection in one part of\nthe graph.\nComparing the theoretical and simulation results for cascades in Figure 3 to the observed distribution of cascade\nsizes in Figure 1(b) highlights the aforementioned puzzle.\nWhy are cascades so small? According to our cascade\nmodel, only transmissibilities in a very narrow range near\nthe threshold produce cascades of the appropriate size of\n\u223c 500 votes. Is there some sort of critical behavior that\ntunes transmissibilities to be exactly near the threshold? Our\nsubsequent analysis suggests a more intuitive possibility.\n\nFriend saturation model for Digg\nAs we previously noted, modeling the spreading process as a\nbranching process assumes that each node has only one voting friend. In that case, the definition of transmissibility, \u03bb,\nis unambiguous: the probability of voting for a story if your\nfriend voted. As we saw from Figure 4, most people exposed\nto a story are exposed multiple times. In that case, even if\nwe maintain the definition of transmissibility in the case of\none friend voting, there is some freedom to model the effect\nof having multiple voting friends. The most straightforward\ngeneralization, which we used in the last section, is the independent cascade model(ICM) which says that if a node has\nn voting friends then it has n independent chances to vote.\nTherefore,\npICM (vote|n friends voted) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)n .\n\n\fFigure 4: Characteristics of voting on Digg. Probability a\nuser votes given n friends voted given by the independent\ncascade model and actual voting behavior on Digg (averaged\nover all cascades).\nWe can measure this quantity on Digg. To do so, we considered all cascades with more than 10 votes. We isolated\nthe users in a cascade who had exactly n friends voting and\ndid not vote versus people with n friends voting on the story\nbefore they themselves voted. For a given n, the percentage\nof people voting is depicted with a solid line in Figure 4. For\nn = 1, the percentage of users voting was 1.3%, suggesting\nan average transmissibility of \u03bb = 0.013. The dashed line\ndepicts pICM (vote|n friends voted) for this value of transmissibility. Even for n = 2, ICM overestimates the probability of a vote, and by n = 10, a relatively common occurrence, ICM is an order of magnitude too large.\nClearly, Figure 4 shows that multiple exposures to a story\nonly marginally increase the probability of voting for it. The\neffect of multiple recommendations quickly saturates and\nwould be better approximated as constant\n\nFigure 5: An example of a cascade for some story. An arrow\nfrom node i \u2192 j means that j is a fan of i, and hence sees\nany stories that i votes on. Time decreases down the y-axis\nso that the y position of a circular node indicates the time at\nwhich the node voted for this story. The dotted line indicates\nthat although 1 is a fan of 4, this has no effect because 1 has\nalready voted for this story before 4 spreads it to 1 again.\nThe cascade terminates in nodes that do not vote for the story\nor nodes that vote but do not have any fans.\nInferring Transmissibility of a Cascade Assuming that\ncascades on Digg spread according to the FSM process, we\ncan infer the transmissibility of actual cascades. Referring\nto Fig. 5, we label the nodes in a cascade in order of voting\ni = 1, . . . , v, where there are v total nodes who vote on the\nstory (not counting the seed node), and i = v + 1, . . . , w\nlabel the w \u2212 v nodes (watching) who are exposed to the\nstory but do not vote on it.\n\npF SM (vote|n friends voted) = \u03bb,\nfor n \u2265 1. We will refer to this simplified model for generating cascades as the \"friend saturation model\" (FSM). We\npoint out that p(vote|n friends voted) actually contains two\nfactors: the probability that you visit Digg and see that your\nfriend(s) voted on a story, and the probability you vote on\nthe story given that you did visit. In fact, a careful examination of Figure 4 suggests that a more sophisticated model of\nbehavior might include some small marginal increase in voting probability from multiple voting friends, balanced by a\nmarginal decrease from having many friends. We stick to the\nsimpler model for simplicity, and because our fundamental\nresult is not sensitive to these details.\nSimulation of FSM We can repeat the simulation procedure of the previous section. This time, though, after a node\nis exposed to a story from one of its friends (voting with\nprobability \u03bb), if the node chooses not to vote, it will not\nvote in the future even if it is exposed to the story again.\nWe generated 100,000 cascades with transmissibility picked\nuniformly from the range [0, 0.04]. Again, we only keep\ncascades with more than 10 votes.\n\nFigure 6: Inferred versus actual transmissibility for simulated cascades in the FSM.\nAccording to the FSM, each node votes for a story that is\nspread to it with probability \u03bb, and we can read the probability of a cascade directly from the graph.\np(cascade|\u03bb) =\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)w\u2212v \u03bbv\n\n(1)\n\nGiven a cascade, the maximum likelihood value for \u03bb is\nv\n\u03bbinf = argmax\u03bb p(\u03bb|cascade) = .\n(2)\nw\n\n\fTo test the accuracy of this inference, we compute the inferred values of \u03bb for simulated cascades and plot them\nagainst the actual values used in the simulation in Figure 6.\nPearson's correlation coefficient for these values is 0.946.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 8: Dynamics of transmissibility and fanout (a) Number of new fans who can see the story (\u2206watching) and who\nactually vote for the story (\u2206voting) vs time (voter i) for\nactual and simulated cascades. (b) Change in the estimated\nvalue of transmissibility for actual and simulated Digg cascades as a function of time.\n\nFigure 7: Cascade size vs inferred transmissibility for simulated and real cascades on the Digg graph, this time plotted\non a log-log scale to highlight the order of magnitude difference between these cascade sizes and predictions of the\nepidemic model (HMF, see text for details).\nPink dots in Figure 7 plot size of simulated cascades generated according to the FSM versus inferred transmissibility. Already, looking at the line plotting the HMF prediction\nfrom Figure 5, we see that cascade sizes are an order of magnitude smaller than for the independent cascade model. Using this model, we can also infer transmissibilities for actual\nDigg cascades and we compare them on the same plot. The\nsimilarity is striking and the overlap so complete that most\nof the simulated cascade dots are covered. Also, note that\nthe threshold still lines up fairly well with HMF and eigenvalue prediction. At the beginning of a cascade, most people\nhave not been exposed multiple times, so the FSM and independent cascade model differ very little, therefore we should\nnot expect much change in the location of the threshold.\nThe inferred transmissibilities of actual Digg cascades are\nalmost all above threshold. This is not surprising, given that\nwe are analyzing stories that have been promoted to the front\npage and, therefore, have been found by Digg to be interesting to the community. Note that the largest cascade, one\nabout Michael Jackson's death, also has the highest inferred\ntransmissibility.\n\nDiscussion\nIn epidemic models, population models, and other branching processes, the principal quantity of interest is the reproductive number, R0 . Intuitively, the reproductive number is\njust the average number of people infected by a single infected person. If R0 > 1, each infection leads to another\nindefinitely, an epidemic. Whereas, if R0 < 1, the infection will die out eventually. Naively, the reproductive number should just be the average fanout, i.e., the average number of fans, times the transmissibility. For Digg, we have\nhki \u2248 6 so R0 \u2248 6\u03bb. In that case, an epidemic threshold\n\nat R0 = 1 \u2192 \u03bbc \u2248 1/6, much higher than we observe. It\nis well known, however, that heterogeneous degree distributions lower the threshold compared to this prediction (Barrat, Barth\u00e9lemy, and Vespignani 2008).\nHowever, we can gain some intuition from this quantity\nif we view it as a dynamic quantity. FSM implies that the\ntrue fanout only includes the number of new fans (those that\nhave not already been exposed to a story) and changes with\ntime. Figure 8(a) shows that with this definition the fanout\nis steadily decaying, both for actual and simulated cascades\non the Digg graph. Effectively, this leads to a decrease in the\nreproductive number as well, so that a cascade that initially\nstarts above the epidemic threshold may fall below it in time.\nAdditionally, in Figure 8(b) we examine the dynamics of\nthe transmissibility. We calculate the transmissibility for\neach voter by looking at the number of votes a story gets\nfrom their fans divided by the number of new fans the voter\nexposed the story to. We see this quantity is constant for\nsimulated cascades as it should be by construction. For actual cascades, on the other hand, the transmissibility remains\nconstant until about 100 people have voted, and then it begins to decline. This is another effect limiting the size of cascades. The decline could be due to decay of novelty (Wu and\nHuberman 2007) or decrease in visibility (Hogg and Lerman\n2009) as a consequence of new stories being submitted to\nDigg. Alternately, people may vote for stories mostly hoping to help them get \"promoted\" to the front page. After\nabout 100 votes, a story is usually promoted, thereby offering less incentive to give it further votes.\nReproductive number is a product of fanout and transmissibility and on Digg both decrease with time. From this perspective, the slowdown of cascade growth is natural.\n\nRelated Work\nContact processes have been extensively studied in epidemiology, where compartmental models, such as SIS\n(susceptible-infectious-susceptible) and SIR (susceptibleinfectious-recovered), have been used to model dynamics of\nepidemics. These models assume that everyone is in contact with everyone else in the population, and rate of infec-\n\n\ftion and recovery is uniform (Bailey 1975). One approach\nto create more realistic models of interactions was to segregate population using different categorical features, such as\nage, sex and so on, and then treat the interactions within\nthe subpopulations as homogenous and symmetric (Hethcote 1978). Another approach to modifying homogenous\nmodels was to represent interactions between individuals as\na directed graph (Kephart and White 1991), leading to a single mean field (MF) reaction equation. To relax the homogeneity assumptions further, and to take into account, the\nstrong fluctuations in the connectivity distribution, the single MF equation is modified to a heterogenous mean field\n(HMF) reaction rate equation (Moreno, Pastor-Satorras, and\nVespignani 2002). In (Prakash et al. 2010), the authors\nconjecture that for any virus propagation model (including\nSIS and SIR), the epidemic threshold depends only on the\nlargest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network.\nHowever, (Castellano and Pastor-Satorras 2010) argue that\nwhile this holds true for the SIS model, the HMF prediction\nin the SIR model seems to be much more accurate than the\ngeneric claim made in (Prakash et al. 2010) for scale-rich\nnetworks. They claim that on quenched scale-rich networks\nthe threshold of generic epidemic models is vanishing or finite depending on the presence or absence of steady state.\nAnother modified spreading process for social contagion that has been considered is the effect of adding \"stiflers\" (Barrat, Barth\u00e9lemy, and Vespignani 2008). Similar\nto FSM, stiflers will not spread a story (rumor) no matter\nhow many times they encounter it. Stiflers, however, are\nnot merely desensitized to multiple exposures, they may actively convert spreaders or susceptible nodes into stiflers.\nThis complicated dynamic can lead to drastic changes, e.g.,\nthe elimination of the epidemic threshold. In Digg, a fan\nwho does not vote on a story after multiple exposures, does\nnot actively persuade the exposed and susceptible fans not\nto vote on a story. Hence, this model does not apply to the\nprocess of information diffusion on Digg.\nThe friend saturating model we have used to describe cascades on Digg is a special case of a broader class of models\ncalled \"decreasing cascade models\" (Kempe, Kleinberg, and\nTardos 2003). Several works have observed similar diminishing returns from friends in social networks. (Leskovec,\nAdamic, and Huberman 2007) analyzed the usefulness of\nproduct recommendations on Amazon.com. They rarely\nfound that anyone received more than a handful of recommendations for any product, and the marginal benefit of multiple recommendations, while product dependent, was typically sublinear (i.e. two recommendations did not make\nsomeone twice as likely to buy as one recommendation).\nLink formation was studied in (Kossinets and Watts 2006),\nwhere they also found diminishing returns in the probability of befriending someone with whom one shares n mutual\nfriends, with saturation occurring around n = 5. The probability of joining a group that n friends have joined was studied in (Backstrom et al. 2006), with saturation occurring for\nn around 10-20.\n(Iribarren and Moro 2009) modeled viral email cascades\nusing branching processes like the Galton-Watson process\nand the Bellman-Harris process. They argued that the topol-\n\nogy of the underlying social network is irrelevant in the prediction of cascade size. This may hold true in the tree-like\ncascades studied by the authors. However as stated previously, in Digg, dynamics of information propagation is not\ntree-like and these models do not hold. Future work includes\nstudying the impact of activity patterns on the information\ndiffusion dynamics.\n\nConclusion\nWe have demonstrated a simple behavior model that strikingly reproduces the behavior of Digg cascades, while standard methods go awry. Many network studies assume that\ngraphs with locally tree-like behavior give a good approximation to real networks. In this case, we find that such\nmethods wildly overestimate the size of cascades. If most\nof the people exposed to a story are exposed repeatedly, understanding how they are affected by repeat exposures is of\nparamount importance. On Digg, multiple exposures to a\nstory are common and have almost no effect on the probability of voting; this severely limits the size of epidemics.\nMuch remains to be studied: whether these results hold\non other social networks, more sophisticated models of response to friends, the time dependence of transmissibility,\nand more detailed analysis of the effect of graph structure\non cascades.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work is supported in part by AFOSR under contracts\n1295GNA276 and FA9550-10-1-0102, and by the NSF under grants 0915678 and 0968370.

This approach uses a cascade generating function to\ncompute a value for the spreading process at each time step\nthat allows us to extract and reconstruct the structure of the\ncascade. We label nodes in the order they are activated. The\ncascade generating function is parameterized by the transmission rates \u03b1j,i \u2200j, i \u2208 [1, N ] (where N is the number\nof nodes involved in the spreading process), which give the\nprobability that a node i activated at time ti will activate a\nconnected node j at a later time tj . For simplicity, we take\n\u03b1ji = \u03b1.\nSuppose there are K seeds, which are activated at times\nt = i1 , . . . , iK . We set the value of the cascade generating\nfunction at the time a seed is activated to \u03c6(ip , \u03b1) = 1. If\nnode i is activated at time ti , the value of the cascade generating function at a later time when node j is activated is:\n\u03c6(j, \u03b1) =\n\nX\ni\u2208f riend(j)\n\n\u03b1\u03c6(i, \u03b1) =\n\nK\nX\n\nf (j, ip , \u03b1)\u03c6(ip , \u03b1).\n\np=1\n\n(3)\nThe function f (j, ip , \u03b1) captures the cumulative effect the\ncascade generated at seed ip has on the node j where tj >\ntip . Note that the same node can belong to two or more cascades generated by different seeds, leading to the collision\n\n\fof cascades effect. All the nodes for which f (j, ip , \u03b1) > 0\n\u2200 \u03b1 > 0, are the nodes that belong to the cascade generated by seed ip . Ref. (Ghosh and Lerman 2011) describes\nan algorithm to extract a cascade generated by a seed that\nhas O(N ) space and O(dN ) time complexity, where d is\nthe maximum degree and N is the number of nodes in the\nnetwork.\n\nReferences\n[Amaral et al. 2000] Amaral, L.
