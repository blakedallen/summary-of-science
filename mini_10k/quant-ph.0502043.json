Finally, we\ngeneralize our entanglement analysis to any unitary group.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.Mn, 04.70.Dy\n\nFor slightly more than a decade entanglement is a resource of quantum information theory and not just a\nmystery in foundations of quantum mechanics [1, 2]. It\nis recognized in systems ranging from spin chains [3] to\nblack holes [4]. However, even the entanglement between two parties remains a slightly bewildering subject, because not much is known beyond the two-qubit\nmixed states. There are various measures of a mixedstate entanglement that reflect different aspects of their\npreparation and manipulation [5]. Recently there was a\nprogress in showing equivalence between different conjectured properties of entanglement measures and communication channels [6] and in estimating entanglement of\ngeneric high-dimensional bipartite states [7]. However,\nit is rarely possible to calculate entanglement of a highdimensional mixed state, unless some symmetries or constraints are involved [8].\nIn this article we present a class of bipartite mixed\nstates for which it is possible to calculate entanglement\nexactly. Moreover, we show that for this family all standard measures of entanglement [5] are equal. We start\nfrom a particular state that actually appears in the black\nhole entropy calculations (for more details see [9]). It is\nthe completely mixed state on the SU(2) invariant space\nof an arbitrary number of qubits. We then generalize\nit to the arbitrary mixtures of zero angular momentum\nstates in any dimension. These states are locally distinguishable but not locally orthogonal (in the sense of\n[10]). As a result, they form a counterexample to the conjectures of [10], but satisfy its slightly weaker form (see\nbelow). These ideas are also relevant to decoherencefree subspaces of qubits and to communication protocols\nwithout a shared reference frame [11].\nIn the simplest scenario, the black hole entropy calcula-\n\n\u2217 elivine@perimeterinstitute.ca\n\u2020 dterno@perimeterinstitute.ca\n\ntion is reduced to counting the number of distinct SU(2)\ninvariant states on the space of 2n qubits. This can be\nunderstood within the framework of loop quantum gravity [9]. The ignorance of a particular microstate makes\nthe statistical state under consideration to be a maximally mixed state on the zero angular momentum J2 = 0\nsubspace of (C2 )\u22972n (space of intertwiners). We label\nthis subspace as H0 and the state as \u03c1. Its orthogonal\ndecomposition is simply\n\u03c1=\n\n1 X\n|\u03a8i ih\u03a8i |,\nN i\n\n(1)\n\nwhere |\u03a8i i span a basis of H0 , J2 |\u03a8i i = 0, and N \u2261\ndim H0 .

For n = 1, it is the\nsimple decomposition of two qubits into irreducible representations:\n(V 1/2 )\u22972 = V 0 \u2295 V 1 ,\n\n\f2\nwhere the singlet state is the antisymmetrized states,\nwhile the spin-1 space is defined as the symmetrized state\nspace.

For simplicity we work in the large n limit. To\nstart with, let Alice and Bob have n qubits each. In this\n\nX\n\nw\u03b1 \u03c0j (\u03b1)S(\u03c1j ) =\n\n\u03b1,j\n\n1 X A B\nc c S(\u03c1j ).\nN j j j\n\n(27)\n\ncase, cA,B\n\u2261 cj , so\nj\n\nEF (\u03c1|n : n) =\n\nn/2\n1 X 2\nc log(2j + 1).\nN j=0 j\n\n(28)\n\n\f4\nAt leading order\n(n)\nEF (\u03c1|n : n) \u2248 log(2jmax\n+ 1),\n\n(29)\n\nwhere the coefficients cj reach a maximal value for j \u2261\n\u221a\n(n)\njmax \u2248 21 n + 2 \u2212 1. Thus,\nEF (\u03c1|n : n) \u2248\n\n1\n2\n\nlog n.\n\n(30)\n\nSuch entanglement is at the origin of the logarithmic corrections to the black hole entropy law. More precisely,\nin a model where the black hole horizon would be constructed out of independent uncorrelated qubits, the entropy would scale simply linearly to the number of qubits\n2n. However, the requirement of invariance under SU(2)\ncreates correlations between the horizon qubits, which are\nrevealed through the logarithmic correction 3/2 log n to\nthe entropy law formula (3). Here we notice a factor 3 between the actual correlation and the entanglement, which\nquantifies the quantum correlations. The difference quantifies the purely classical correlations, which turn out to\nbe roughly twice the quantum correlations. It seems that\nthis is related to a factor 3 noticed between the classical\nchannel capacity and the quantum channel capacity for\nsecure communication protocols based on decoherencefree subspaces [16].\nMore generally, we find that for all bipartite splittings of the spin network with sufficiently large number\nof qubits comprising the smaller space, it is possible to\nshow that\nI\u03c1 (A : B) \u2261 S(\u03c1A ) + S(\u03c1B ) \u2212 S(\u03c1) \u2243 3SE (\u03c1|A : B) (31)\n(the quantum mutual information [17] between the black\nhole horizon and its parts is three times the entanglement between the halves). Moreover, if the ratio between\nthe number of qubits is keep fixed while n is arbitrary,\nthe logarithmic correction 32 log n asymptotically equals\nto I\u03c1 (A : B), so the deviation of the black hole entropy\nfrom its classical value equals to the total amount of correlations between the halves of spin networks that describe it (see [9] for more details).\nNow we can push the use of entanglement further. We\nconsider the set-up when Alice has 2 qubits and Bob holds\nthe rest. In this case cA\n0,1 = 1, and Bob's multiplicities\nB\nasymptotically satisfy c0 /N \u2248 1/4, cB\n1 /N \u2248 3/4. Hence\nEF (\u03c1|2 : 2n \u2212 2) =\n\n3\ncB\n1\nlog 3 \u2248 log 3.\nN\n4\n\n(32)\n\nThe fact that this actual entanglement is not the maximal\nentanglement log 4 can be interpreted as the pair of qubits\nnot being maximally attached to the horizon, i.e. having\na non-vanishing probability of getting detached from the\nhorizon and evaporating from the black hole. This logic\n\ncan be made more precise in the context of loop quantum\ngravity [15], and the unentangled fraction cB\n0 /N can be\nshown to be related to the black hole evaporation rate\n[9]. An important detail is that the unentangled fraction\nconverges to a non-zero constant value for large black\nholes, which means that the pair of qubits are a constant\nprobability of evaporating independently of the size of the\nblack hole. This seems at first in contradiction with the\nbehavior of the Hawking radiation. Nevertheless, to turn\na probability into a rate, we need a time scale. Choosing\na time scale proportional to the mass to the black hole in\nthe semi-classical regime, we recover the right expected\nbehavior [9]. Such a time scale can be defined for example\nas the period of the smallest circular orbit around the\nblack hole.\nLet us now compute the distillable entanglement of \u03c1.\nFrom Eq. (11) it is obvious that Alice and Bob can exactly identify the states |j, aj , bj i by LOCC. It suggests a\nsimple distillation strategy: Alice and Bob project onto\none of the states |j, aj , bj i. From Eq. (11) it follows that\nwith a probability\nB\np j = cA\nj cj /N\n\n(33)\n\nthey end up with a singlet on VAj \u2297 VBj . Such a state\ncontains log(2j + 1) ebits of entanglement (it can be converted into this number of the standard singlets). Hence\nthe protocol yields SE of the distillable entanglement.\nSince ED (\u03c1) \u2264 EF (\u03c1) \u2264 SE this protocol provides a concise proof of the Lemma and shows that\nED (\u03c1) = EF (\u03c1) = SE .\n\n(34)\n\nThe are two natural ways in which this setup can be\ngeneralized. First, the elementary systems that Alice and\nBob hold can be of any fixed dimension. In the case of 2n\nobjects of some higher spin s \u2208 N/2, the degeneracy subspaces \u03c3 j are not irreducible representations of the permutation group, but the labeling of the states as |j, aj , bj i\nand the entire chain of reasoning that led to Eq. (34) remain unchanged. It is interesting to note that the logarithmic dependence of the entanglement on the system\nsize also persists for arbitrary spins. Indeed, numerical\nsimulations and explicit calculations of the black hole entropy [9] shows that the asymptotic estimate of Eq. (29) is\n(n)\nindependent\nof the basic unit: jmax still goes proportion\u221a\nally to n at first order, so that EF (\u03c1|n : n) \u223c 21 log n.\nIn particular, we derive the same \u22123/2 factor in front\nof the logarithmic correction to the black hole entropy\nlaw (3) whatever spin s we use to construct the model of\nquantum black hole.\nThe second point is that the mixture does not have to\nbe equally weighted. The same steps as above lead to the\nfollowing result.\n\n\f5\nProposition: Consider an arbitrary convex combination\nof the zero spin states,\n\u03c1=\n\nP P\nj\n\n(j)\n\naj ,bj\n\nwaj ,bj |jihj|AB \u2297 |aj ihaj |\u03c3A \u2297 |bj ihbj |\u03c3B ,\nP\n(j)\n(35)\naj ,bj waj ,bj = 1\n\nall measures of entanglement for the state \u03c1 are equal to\nX (j)\nSE (\u03c1) =\n(36)\nwaj ,bj log(2j + 1).\nj,aj ,bj\n\nThe only change in the calculation of ED is that\nX (j)\npj =\nwaj ,bj ,\n\n(37)\n\naj ,bj\n\nso for any state of the form (35) its distillable entanglement is given by Eq.

It was also conjectured that the entanglement measures coincide only for such mixed states.\nWhile the states \u03c1j,aj indeed satisfy Eq. (38), the reductions of the sates |j, aj , bj i that differ only by bj lead to\nthe same \u03c1j,aj and hence are identical. Nevertheless, the\nstates |j, aj , bj i are distinguishable by LOCC, and this is\nenough to establish the equality of the entanglement measures. Hence, we propose that the conjecture should be\nmodified, i.e. the decomposing ensemble should consist\nof the states that are distinguishable by LOCC without\nbeing destroyed.\nLet us conclude with the fact that our results hold for\nany unitary group. Indeed, using U(M ) or SU(M ) instead of SU(2), Schur's duality and the decomposition of\ntensor powers of the fundamental representation in terms\nof representations of the permutation group still hold.\nTherefore one is lead to the same result that all measures\nof entanglement on arbitrary mixtures on the invariant\nsubspace of the tensor products of qudits are equal, with\nthe same consequences in terms of the black hole entropy\nlaw.\nWe thank Aram Harrow, Pawel Horedecki, Martin Plenio, and Karol \u017byczkowski for discussions and helpful\ncomments.\n\nPhys.
