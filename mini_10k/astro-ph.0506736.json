A\nseries of self-consistent, three-dimensional, continuum radiative transfer models are\nconstructed for a grid of models parameterized by central luminosity, filling factor,\nclump radius, and face-averaged optical depth. The temperature distribution within\nthe clouds is studied as a function of this parameterization. Among our results, we\nfind that: (a) the effective optical depth in clumpy regions is less than in equivalent\nhomogeneous regions of the same average optical depth, leading to a deeper penetration of heating radiation in clumpy clouds, and temperatures higher by over 60\nper cent; (b)penetration of radiation is driven by the fraction of open sky (FOS) \u2013\nwhich is a measure of the fraction of solid angle along which no clumps exist; (c) FOS\nincreases as clump radius increases and as filling factor decreases; (d) for values of\nFOS > 0.6 \u2212 0.8 the sky is sufficiently \"open\" that the temperature distribution is\nrelatively insensitive to FOS; (e) the physical process by which radiation penetrates is\npreferentially through streaming of radiation between clumps as opposed to diffusion\nthrough clumps; (f) filling factor always dominates the determination of the temperature distribution for large optical depths, and for small clump radii at smaller optical\ndepths; (g) at lower face-averaged optical depths, the temperature distribution is most\nsensitive to filling factors of 1 - 10 per cent, in accordance with many observations; (h)\ndirect shadowing by clumps can be important for distances approximately one clump\nradius behind a clump.\nKey words: stars: formation \u2013 infrared: stars \u2013 ISM: clouds.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAn understanding of the star formation process requires an\nunderstanding of the underlying density distribution in star\nforming regions. In a direct sense, knowledge of the density\ndistribution can help distinguish between different potential\ndynamical scenarios for energy injection, collapse, fragmentation, and outflow. In a more indirect sense, the density\ndistribution significantly affects our ability to infer source\nproperties through its influence on thermal balance, chemistry, local emission, and the processing of radiation (radiative transfer) between the emitting region and the observer.\nThe density distribution is important for the dust as\nwell as the gas. In particular, the dust forms the dominant source of opacity to visible and infrared (IR) radiation, and is the dominant source of IR continuum radiation.\nPerhaps more importantly, the dust dominates thermal balance by direct interaction with the radiation field (van de\nHulst 1949), and through collisions with the gas (Greenberg\n1971; Goldreich & Kwan 1974). As the problems of therc 2005 RAS\n\nmal balance and radiative transfer are non-local, non-linear\nfeedback problems, comparison of detailed models with observations remain the best choice of reliably inferring the\nsource properties.\nSource geometry is a significant problem in modeling\nstar-forming regions. While it is normal to assume some geometric symmetry, such restrictions are generally not realistic. In particular, a wealth of observations (e.g. Migenes et\nal. 1989; Dickman et al. 1990; Falgarone et al. 1991; Cesaroni\net al. 1991; Marscher et al. 1993; Zhou et al. 1994; Plume\net al. 1997; Shepherd et al. 1997) show that and fragmentation (see also Goldsmith 1996; Tauber 1996 and references\ntherein). This is supported by dynamical models (e.g. Truelove et al. 1998; Marinho & Lepine 2000; Klapp & Sigalotti\n1998; Klessen 1997) which naturally produce clumpy and\nfragmented structures.\nPrevious work on radiative transfer in dusty, clumpy\nenvironments has been undertaken (e.g. Hegmann & Kegel\n2003; Witt & Gordon 1996; Varosi & Dwek 1999; Boiss\u00e9\n1990). However, much of the previous work has concentrated\n\n\f2\n\nS. D. Doty et al.\n\non scattering (e.g. with application to reflection nebulae),\nthe detailed methods of solution, and/or some of the fundamental results such as ability of radiation to penetrate to\napparently high optical depths. In this paper we use a 3-D\nmonte carlo radiative transfer model to extend the previous\nwork to a wider and different range of physical conditions.\nIn particular, we construct a large grid of models in an effort to better delineate and understand the effects of clumpy\nmedia on radiative transfer. By controlling and varying the\nparameterization of the source, we attempt to disentangle\nsome of the underlying physical causes of these effects.\nIn section two we describe the model. We discuss the\ngeneral effects of clumping in section three. In section four,\nwe introduce the \"fraction of open sky\" (FOS), and discuss\nthe effects of number density, FOS, optical depth, filling factor, and clump size on the dust temperature distribution. We\ndiscuss the effects of shadowing in section five. Finally, we\ndraw conclusions in section six.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nMODEL\nMonte carlo model and invariant parameters\n\nWe have constructed detailed, self-consistent, threedimensional radiative transfer models through dust. The\nmodel utilizes a monte-carlo approach, combined with an\napproximate lambda iteration to ensure true convergence\neven at high optical depths. The model has been tested\nagainst existing 1-D (Egan, Leung, & Spagna 1988) and 2D (Spagna, Leung, & Egan 1991) codes, and in modeling a\n3-D source (Doty et al. 2005) with good success. Since the\npresent study concentrates upon opaque molecular clouds\nwhere far-infrared radiaton should dominate both for external heating and emission, we ignore the effects of scattering.\nTest cases in both one- and multiple-dimensions show that\nscattering plays only a very small role on the temperature\ndistribution within the majority of the sources.\nBased upon the input parameters discussed below, we\nsolve for the dust temperature and radiation field at each\npoint in the model cloud. The computational volume is\ntaken to be cubical of size 1 pc. Each model utilized an\n81\u00d781\u00d781 cell grid, yielding a typical resolution of \u223c 3\u00d71016\ncm. The region is taken to be a two-phase medium consisting of high density clumps, and a low density inter-clump\nmedium. The clump/inter-clump density ratio is taken to be\nnclump /ninter\u2212clump = 100 from observations (e.g. Bergin et\nal. 1996). The external radiation field is taken from interstellar radiation field (ISRF) compiled by Mathis, Mezger,\n& Panagia (1983). Finally, we adopt the dust opacities in\ncolumn 5 of Table 1 of Ossenkopf & Henning (1994), which\nhave been successful at fitting observations of both highmass (e.g., van der Tak et al. 1999, 2000) and low-mass\n(e.g., Evans et al. 2001) regions of star formation.\n\n2.2\n\nModel parameters\n\nWe adopt a uniformly distributed interclump medium\ninterspersed with higher density clumps having\nnclump /ninter\u2212clump = 100. The clumps are randomly\ndistributed within the computational volume. The number\nof clumps, and the densities of the clumps and interclump\n\nTable 1. Model input parameters\nNumber\n\nL\u2217\n(L\u2299 )\n\nf\n\nrc\n(pc)\n\n\u03c4\u0304\n\n1\n2\n3\n\n0\n3\n300\n\n0.01\n0.1\n0.3\n\n0.025\n0.05\n0.1\n\n10\n100\nn/a\n\nmedium depend upon the filling factor (f ), the clump\nradius (rc ), and the face-averaged optical depth (\u03c4\u0304 ).\nThe filling factor specifies the fraction of the volume at\nhigh density. It is given by f \u2261 Vclumps /Vtotal . We adopt\nfilling factors of f = 0.01, 0.1, and 0.3 in accord with observations (e.g. Snell et al. 1984; Bergin et al. 1996; Carr 1987).\nWhen all other parameters are kept fixed, a higher f corresponds to a larger number of clumps, and a more nearly\ncontinuous dust distribution. Furthermore, due to optical\ndepth constraint (see \u03c4\u0304 below), a larger f also corresponds\nto clumps and interclump medium of lower density.\nWe make the simplifying assumption that all nonoverlapping clumps are spheres of radius rc . We choose\nrc = 0.025 pc, 0.05 pc, and 0.1 pc in accord with observations (e.g. Carr 1987; Howe et al. 1993). Again, the constraint on the optical depth implies that larger clump radii\nyield smaller densities within the clumps.\nThe dust number densities are normalized by averaging\nthe optical depth over one entire (81\u00d781) face of the computational cube. We call this the face-averaged optical depth,\nand denote it by \u03c4\u0304 . This was done to simulate the optical\ndepth / column density that might be inferred by a very\nlarge beam, although it has the same effect as normalizing\nto the total cloud mass. The face-averaged optical depth is\ntaken to be \u03c4\u0304 = 10, and 100, in keeping with observations\nfrom extinction studies (Lada, Alves, & Lada 1999).\nFinally, the models are specified by the strength of\nthe internal radiation field, specified by the luminosity of\nthe central source, L\u2217 . We have constructed a grid having\nL\u2217 = 0L\u2299 , 3L\u2299 , and 300L\u2299 to represent a starless core, a\nlow-luminosity central object, and a high-luminosity central\nobject, respectively. However, in this paper, we restrict our\nreport to the starless cores only (L\u2217 = 0). The others will\nbe presented in a forthcoming paper.\nThe ranges of parameters specified above led to a grid\nof 54 models. Each model is numbered by a four-digit integer\nIL If Irc I\u03c4\u0304 . The integers, and their corresponding values are\ngiven in Table 1 for reference. As an example, model 1221\nhas L\u2217 = 0, f = 0.01, rc = 0.025 pc, and \u03c4\u0304 = 10.\n\n2.3\n\nInvariance with clump and photon\nrandomization\n\nOne concern with \"random\" clump distribution and montecarlo simulation is the reproducibility of results with different realizations of the clump distribution (i.e. different initial seeds in the clump generation), and different photon ray\npaths. As a test, we have considered 9 different initial seeds\nfor the clump distributions and photon paths respectively.\nTo quantify the temperature distribution, we calculate\na spherical average temperature, given by\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\f3\n\nClumping in star-forming regions\n12\n16\n\nz-axis\n\nclumps\nno clumps\n\n14\n12\n\n11\n\n10\n8\n6\n\n10\n\n4\n16\n\ny-axis\n\n14\n\n1K\n\n9\n\n12\n\n200 photon\n\n10\n8\n\n7\n\n100 photon\n\n8\n\n50 photon\n\n6\n\n20 photon\n\n4\n16\n\nx-axis\n\n14\n8 photon\n\n12\n10\n\n6\n\n8\n6\n5\n-0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\nFigure 1.

In keeping with the viewpoint that the high\ndensity clumps mostly affect the local radiation field, while\nthe the low density medium best probes the radiation field,\nthe average temperature is taken only over the low-density\ncells.\nThe differences in hT (r)i between different clump distribution realizations are always much less than 1K, and\nare on average less than 0.1K. Based upon this (and direct\ncomparison of later analyses) the specific realization of the\ndensity distribution does not affect our conclusions.\nLikewise, we have modified the number and distribution\nof incident photons to test for sufficient monte carlo coverage. The effect of number of photons on for hT (r)i is shown\nin Fig. 1. To be conservative, we adopt 100 photons per cell\nface, at which point differences are less than 0.05K (1 per\ncent).\nSimilarly, varying the random distribution of photon\npaths causes deviations of < 0.1K, confirming that the coverage of the cells by ray-paths is sufficient to concentrate on\nthe consequences of clumping.\n\n3\n\n4\n-1\n\nCLUMPING: GENERAL\n\nIn this section we briefly discuss the general effects of clumping on the dust temperature distribution. For clarity, we\ndirectly compare a clumpy, externally heated (L\u2217 = 0), lowdensity (f = 0.1), opaque (\u03c4\u0304 = 10), model having small\nclumps (rc = 0.05 pc) to one with a uniform density distric 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n0.7\n\n0.65\n\n0.6\n\n0.55\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n1.1\n\nFigure 3.

From these two figures, it is immediately obvious that the inclusion of clumps \u2013 even for the same \u03c4\u0304 \u2013\nchanges the temperature structure significantly. In particular, the clumpy model experiences higher temperatures by\nup to 50 per cent toward the center, and up to \u223c 65 per cent\nat intermediate radii. As a result, we conclude that clumping itself affects the temperature distribution, even when the\naverage source mass or column density is held constant.\nThis result confirms the previous finding of others (e.g.\nHegmann & Kegel 2003; Witt & Gordon 1996; Varosi &\nDwek 1999) that the effective optical depth in a clumpy\nmedium is less than the homogeneous value. It also suggests\nthat it is important to understand the way in which the parameterization of the clumpy density distribution can affect\nthe dust temperature. We address these individually below.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nCLUMPING: EFFECTS OF PARAMETERS\n\nFigure 5. Temperature as a function of angle-averaged attenuation (he\u2212\u03c4 i) for three distances from source center (Rout /3,\nRout /2, and 2Rout /3). The solid symbols correspond to the temperature in the low density interclump medium, while the open\nsymbols correspond to the high density clumps. This result is for\nmodel 1221. Other models are qualitatively identical.\n\nwithin the high density clumps than it is within the lowerdensity interclump medium. Since the total emission by\ngrains of absorption efficiency hQabs \u03c0a2 i \u221d \u03bd \u03b2 goes as T 4+\u03b2 ,\none might expect a factor of 100 increase in density to lead\nto a decrease in temperature by a factor 1001/(4+\u03b2) . Given\nthat \u03b2 \u223c 1.8 in the FIR for the adopted dust model, this is\na decrease by a factor of \u223c 2.2. For comparison, the average\ndecrease within the clumps is a factor of 1.5 with a greatest decrease a factor of 1.6. This is due to the fact that the\nclump centers can be warmed by absorbing the radiation\nemitted from the clump edges, in effect trapping radiation\nwithin the clumps (similar to the opaque centers of centrally\nheated envelopes, Doty & Leung 1994).\nOf even further interest is the fact that while the temperature decreases coincide with the locations of the clumps,\nthe shape of the temperature profiles do not match the steepness of the clump/interclump interfaces. This further suggests that radiative transfer effects play a role.\n\nNumber density\n\nIn Fig. 4 we plot the temperature (solid lines, left hand scale)\nand dust number density (dotted lines, right hand scale) for\ncuts along the x-, y-, and z-axes. The clumps are signified\nby the higher density regions. As can be seen, the clumps\nare resolved, and appear to be of different sizes as the axes\ndo not penetrate all clumps along a diameter. The \"wiggles\"\nand \u223c 0.1\u22120.2 K deviations in the temperature distribution\nare not simply indicative of the uncertainties in the monte\ncarlo calculation (see previous results, and Fig. 2). Instead,\nthe majority are dominated by local differences in radiation\nfield due to different amounts of blocking of radiation by the\nsurrounding clumps (see Sect. 5 for more discussion).\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4, the dust temperature is lower\n\n4.2\n\nEffective optical depth\n\nPrevious authors (e.g., Hegmann & Kegel 2003; Witt & Gordon 1996; Varosi & Dwek 1999) identified the effective optical depth (\u2212 ln[LAT /L\u2217 ]), where LAT is the attenuated flux\nintegrated over all solid angles and L\u2217 is the unattenuated\nflux integrated over all solid\nR angles or\nR equivalently the average attenuation (he\u2212\u03c4 i \u2261 e\u2212\u03c4 d\u03a9/ d\u03a9) as a key measure\nof the ability of radiation to penetrate. This is reasonable,\nas the fewer photons penetrating leads to cooler dust, which\nis confirmed in Fig. 5, where we plot the dust temperature\nat three different positions along the x-axis as a function of\nhe\u2212\u03c4 i for model 1221.\nOne question is left unanswered \u2013 the physical process\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fClumping in star-forming regions\ndriving the angle-averaged attenuation must be identified.\nThere are two possibilities: (1) the ability of radiation to\npenetrate is dominated by general attenuation by multiple\nclumps along a given line of sight and attenuation by the\nlow-density interclump medium; or (2) the radiation streams\nprimarily through the \"holes\" between clumps. We consider\nthese two possibilities in the following subsection.\n\n16\n\nz-axis\n\n0.8\n\nT\nFOS\n\n14\n\n0.6\n\n12\n10\n\n0.4\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n6\n4\n16\n\n0\n0.8\n\ny-axis\n\n14\n\n4.3\n\nOptical depth and fraction of open sky\n\nIn order to answer the question of whether and how\nmuch geometry matters in determining the local temperature/radiation field, we consider two limiting cases. These\nare a measure with limited geometry information, the angleaveraged optical depth (h\u03c4 i), and a measure which is dominated by geometry information, the fraction of open sky\n(FOS). We consider these seperately below.\nIf the radiation generally diffuses and is attenuated by\nmultiple clumps or the low-density interclump medium, we\nmight expect to find a dependence of source properties on\nthe optical depth averaged over all directions. As a result,\nwe define the angle-averaged optical depth to be\nh\u03c4 i \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4 (\u03a9)d\u03a9/\n\nZ\n\nd\u03a9.\n\n(2)\n\nOn the other hand, if the radiation penetrates mainly\nby streaming through holes between clumps, then the source\nproperties should depend more significantly on the fraction\nof the sky that is uncovered by the clumps. Consequently,\nwe also define the fraction of open sky, FOS, to be\nFOS \u2261\n\nZ\n\nqd\u03a9/\n\nZ\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n6\n4\n16\n\n0\n0.8\n\nx-axis\n\n14\n\n0.6\n\n12\n10\n\n0.4\n\n8\n\n0.2\n\n6\n4\n-1\n\n0\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nFigure 6.

Consequently, FOS=1 implies\nan open sky with no clumps, while FOS=0 corresponds to\na closed sky where all lines of sight are blocked by clumps.\nAs a first test of the effect of FOS on temperature, in\nFig. 6 we plot the temperature (solid lines, left-hand scale)\nand FOS (dotted lines, right-hand scale) for cuts along the\nx-, y-, and z-axes, similar to Fig. 4. There is a strong correlation of dust temperature with FOS. Interestingly, the\nshape of the temperature distribution correlates with FOS\nto a much higher degree than it anti-correlates with the dust\nnumber density. This strongly suggests that FOS plays a key\nrole, which we test in the following discussion.\n\n4.3.2\n\n0.6\n\n12\n\nMotivation and definition of h\u03c4 i and FOS\n\n4.3.1\n\n5\n\nEffect of h\u03c4 i on temperature\n\nTo test the role of angle-averaged optical depth, we consider\nthe dependence of temperature on h\u03c4 i for a fixed FOS. In\nthis way, we can isolate the effects of h\u03c4 i from FOS. The\nFOS value here was chosen to maximize the number of data\npoints to provide for the best possible statistics. The resulting dependence of temperature on h\u03c4 i for three different\nradial positions is shown in Fig. 7. We note that the chosen FOS range is small to make the result independent of\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n10\n9.5\n\n0.309pc\n\n9.5\n9\n8.5\n\n0.185pc\n\n8.5\n8\n7.5\n7\n6.5\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nFigure 7.

The results are shown in Fig. 8. We have also included\ndashed lines at m = \u00b13\u03c3m(h\u03c4 i) as a guide.\nTo best understand the utility of this comparison, consider a case for which the temperature and h\u03c4 i are uncorrelated. In this case, the fit between them should yield a zero\nslope, and thus \u03b8(h\u03c4 i) = 0. Likewise, a significant correlation\nshould yield \u03b8 > 3 (i.e., a 3\u03c3 result). The results in Fig. 8\nare much more consistent with \u03b8(h\u03c4 i) = 0 throughout much\nof the cloud, and only reach \u03b8(h\u03c4 i) = 3 for r > 0.7Rout .\nConsequently, we conclude that there may exist only a weak\ncorrelation between the dust temperature and h\u03c4 i.\n4.3.3\n\n0.3\n\nEffect of FOS on temperature\n\nIn a similar manner to h\u03c4 i, we consider the effect of FOS\non temperature. In this case, we keep h\u03c4 i fixed. In analogy\nwith before, h\u03c4 i was chosen to maximize the number of data\npoints to ensure the best possible statistics. The resulting\ndependence of temperature on FOS for three different radial\npositions is shown in Fig. 9.\nInspection of Fig. 9 suggests that there exists some correlation of temperature with FOS. In a similar manner to\nh\u03c4 i, we quantify this by fitting the data distribution at each\nradial distance with a best-fit straight line.

The results are show in Fig. 10. We have also\nincluded dashed lines at \u00b13\u03c3m(FOS) as a guide.\nThe results in Fig. 10 are generally not consistent with\n\u03b8(FOS) = 0, and lie at or above \u03b8(FOS) = 3 for a good\ndeal of the cloud (r > 0.25Rout ). Consequently, we can say\nthat there exists a significant correlation between the dust\ntemperature and FOS.\nFinally, it is encouraging to note that the correlation\nbetween temperature and FOS is positive. This is expected,\nsince a higher FOS leads to more direct heating by the external radiation field, and is evidenced by m(FOS) > 0.\n\n4.3.4\n\nExtension and interpretation of h\u03c4 i, FOS results\n\nWe can extend the discussion of FOS and h\u03c4 i to the remainder of our family of models. The results are summarized in\nTable 2. In this table, we specify the fractional radial position from cloud center as x \u2261 r/Rout .\nThe results in Table 2 require an understanding of the\nrange over which FOS or h\u03c4 i can have a significant effect\non the temperature distribution. In the table, xmax is the\npoint beyond which, FOS does not play a significant role on\nthe temperature distribution. We find (see Section 4.5) this\noccurs for FOS > 0.6 \u2212 0.8.\nTo understand the origin and location of this region,\nconsider a point a distance r from the center of the region of radius Rout . The number of clumps exterior to r\nis N = f (Rout /r)3 (1 \u2212 x). If these clumps are distributed\nabout this point on the outward facing half of an equal\n3\nvolume sphere of radius reff = [4Rout\n(1 \u2212 x)/(4\u03c0/3)]1/3 ,\nthen the fraction of open sky in the outward direction is\n2\nFOS+ = 1 \u2212 N rc2 /2reff\n. We plot the resulting estimate of\n+\nFOS as a function of position in Fig. 11. As can be seen,\nall models with a low filling factor (x1xx) have FOS+ > 0.8,\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\nFigure 11. An estimate of the FOS in the outward facing hemisphere as a function of radial position. The solid lines correspond\nto f = 0.01, the dotted lines to f = 0.1, and the dashed lines\nto f = 0.3.

For these models, FOS is not expected\nto play a significant role in determining the temperature distribution. As a result, the radius up to which FOS should\nplay a role (\u2261 xmax ) becomes zero for these models in Table\n2. For other models, 0 < xmax < 1.\nTo understand the comparative importance of FOS vs.\nh\u03c4 i, we consider the average deviation of \u03b8 from zero for\nx < xmax . This is reported in the last column of Table 2. For\nmodels in which xmax = 0, such an average is not possible,\nand the result is noted as \"n/a\". For the case where only\n\u03b8(FOS) > 3 for x < xmax , the only meaningful correlation\nof temperature is with FOS, and so the result is noted as \u221e.\nIn all other cases, the last column is set to \u03b8(FOS)/\u03b8(h\u03c4 i),\nwhere the bar signifies an average over all positions for which\n\u03b8 > 3 and x < xmax . As can be seen by the last column\nof Table 2 the effect of FOS exceeds the effects of h\u03c4 i in\ndetermining the temperature.\nFinally, one may consider the size of the region over\nwhich FOS and h\u03c4 i are important. To do this, in Table 2 we\nspecify xcut , defined to be the position beyond which \u03b8 > 3.\nGenerally xcut (h\u03c4 i) > xcut (FOS). At low optical depths, this\nis true whenever xmax 6= 0. For this set, the mean values for\nxcut (h\u03c4 i) \u223c 0.7, and xcut (FOS) \u223c 0.4. This suggests that not\nonly is FOS (and thus photon streaming) more important\nthan h\u03c4 i, but that it is also important deeper into the cloud\nthan h\u03c4 i. This is not a suprise, as openings are a significantly\nmore efficient method of carrying energy deep into the cloud.\nAt larger optical depths, the effect is not as strong due to\nthe fact that the less-dense interclump medium is capable\nof meaningful attenuation by itself.\nThe analysis above demonstrates that the angleaveraged optical depth does not provide sufficient informa-\n\n\f8\n\nS.

This is seen in the\nfact that the correlation of temperature with FOS is generally stronger than the correlation with h\u03c4 i, as well as the\nfact that the region over which FOS is important is generally larger than the region over which h\u03c4 i is important. As\na result, this suggests that indeed the ability of radiation to\npenetrate further into a clumpy source than a homogeneous\nsource is due to the streaming of radiation through holes.\n\n4.4\n\nFilling factor and clump radius\n\nIn this subsection we investigate the effects of filling factor and clump radius on the dust temperature distribution. Since f and rc both geometrically parameterizatize\nthe clump distribution, we account for the range of realizations in the actual clump distribution by averaging\nhT (r)i over nine different realizations. Finally, we note that\nin this subsection we present the temperature contrast (\u2261\nhT (rin )i/Tout ), which minimizes the effect of absolute density scaling between models.\n\nFilling factor\n\nFigure 12 shows a representative variation in the spherical\naverage temperature distribution with filling factor (f ) for\nrc = 0.025pc and \u03c4\u0304 = 100. The temperature distributions\nfor other models in the grid are qualitatively similar. The\nratio of inner to outer temperature for the full grid (including uncertainties due to different realizations) are shown in\nTables 3 and 4.\nWe see from these data that the role of filling factor\nvaries with clump radius. First, the dust temperature decreases with increasing f as expected, since a larger f leads\nto a smaller FOS, and thus less heating available to the lower\ndensity medium and lower temperatures.\nSecond, the temperature distribution for the smallest\nfilling factor remains essentially unchanged as the clump size\nchanges. This is due to the high FOS throughout, so that\neach point is well-coupled to the external radiation field,\nindependent of the size of the clumps.\nThird, the effect of filling factor varies inversely with\nclump radius. This is expected, as FOS increases with increasing rc , and decreasing f . To see this, consider the simplifying case of viewing from the center of a sphere, in which\nspherical clumps of radius rc are randomly distributed a distance Rout from the center, and in which no clumps overlap.\nThis yields FOS = 1 \u2212 f Rout /4rc . For f = 0.01 \u2212 0.3, this\nyields FOS = 0.63 \u2212 1 for rc = 0.1 pc, 0.25 \u2212 1 for rc = 0.05\npc, and \u223c 0 \u2212 1 for rc = 0.025 pc. In reality FOS is influenced by two further competing factors \u2013 clump overlap in\nprojection (increases FOS), and clump distribution in distance (decreases FOS). The actual variation of FOS with\nmodel parameters is given in Fig. 13. The result roughly\nagrees with the estimate above. The lower trend of the actual results imply that clump overlap is not a significant\neffect.\nThese results are somewhat different for models with\nhigh optical depth, \u03c4\u0304 = 100. As confirmed in Table 4, the\ntemperature distribution at these high optical depths depends significantly on f , independent of rc .\nThis independence of temperature on clump radius for\nlarge optical depths can can be easily understood by considering the optical depth of individual clumps for various models. For the ISRF of Mathis, Mezger, and Panagia (1983), roughly 1/2 of the total energy is contained in\n\u03bb < 25\u03bcm, 2/3 in \u03bb < 115\u03bcm, and 3/4 in \u03bb < 360\u03bcm. The\noptical depths of a clump at these wavelengths for \u03c4\u0304 = 10\nare, 1.1 < \u03c4clump (25\u03bcm) < 67, 0.1 < \u03c4clump (115\u03bcm) < 6,\nand 0.01 < \u03c4clump (360\u03bcm) < 0.8. On the other hand, for\n\u03c4\u0304 = 100 the optical depths are ten times higher, namely,\n11 < \u03c4clump (25\u03bcm) < 670, 1 < \u03c4clump (115\u03bcm) < 60, and\n0.1 < \u03c4clump (360\u03bcm) < 8. This implies that the clumps for\n\u03c4\u0304 = 10 are opaque to 1/2 of the heating radiation, but transparent to the remaining 1/2. Consequently, f (and FOS) can\ncontrol roughly 1/2 of the heating radiation. However, for\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fClumping in star-forming regions\n\n9\n\n1\n\n0.95\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\n\n0.75\n\n0.7\n\n0.65\n\n0.6\n16.5\n\n17\n\n17.5\n\n18\n\nFigure 13.

As\na result, it is not suprising to realize that as the clumps become more opaque, filling factor and the ability of radiation\nto stream between the clumps becomes more important.\n\ncal depth, \u03c4\u0304 = 100. In Table 4 we can see the variation in\nthe temperature contrast. As discussed previously, the increasing opacity of the clumps further amplifies the effect\nof filling factor and FOS on the temperature distribution,\nleaving the effect of clump radius as unimportant.\n\n4.4.3\n4.4.2\n\nClump radius\n\nFigure 14 shows a representative variation in the spherical\naverage temperature distribution with clump radius (rc ) for\nf = 0.1 and \u03c4\u0304 = 100. Again, the temperature distributions\nin the other models are qualitatively similar, and the temperature contrast results are shown in Tables 3 & 4.\nWe see from these data that the role of clump radius\nvaries with filling factor. In comparison to the case of filling\nfactor, the smallest clumps yield the lowest temperatures,\nand the largest clumps the highest temperatures, consistent\nwith the FOS findings in Fig. 13.\nThe independence of temperature with rc for f = 0.01 is\ndue to the large FOS. In particular, there exists a large number of open lines of sight to any point, making clump variation unimportant. Conversely, as f increases, clump size\nbecomes more important. This is due to the fact that high\nfilling factor models have a commensurately greater number of small clumps. As discussed previously, many small\nclumps are more effective at covering the sky than fewer\nlarge clumps \u2013 see Fig. 13. Consequently, clump radius is an\nimportant factor in determining the temperature profile for\nhigh filling factors.\nAs before, the results differ for regions of higher optic 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\nRelative regions of importance\n\nBy combining the results of the two previous subsections\n(e.g. Fig. 13 and Tables 3 & 4), we can infer the regions of importance for filling factor and clump radius. We first consider\nthe case of \u03c4\u0304 = 10. At these moderate optical depths, we see\nthat clump radius only becomes important for f > 0.1. In\nthe case of f < 0.1, clump radius essentially plays no role\nand is dominated by the fact that the FOS is always high\nfor such small filling factors.\nOn the other hand, we see that filling factor only becomes important for rc < 0.05 pc. For rc > 0.05 pc, the\ntemperature is dominated by the fact that the FOS is relatively insensitive to f , due to the large number of holes left\nby scenarios with small numbers of large clumps.\nIt is interesting that the inferred values of f from observations routinely fall in the range of a few per cent (e.g.\nHogerheijde, Jansen, van Dishoeck 1995; Snell et al. 1984;\nMundy et al. 1986; Bergin 1996). In light of the results\nabove, this may not be a suprise. For smaller filling factors,\nf and rc do not play a significant role in the temperature\ndistribution. On the other hand, for larger filling factors,\nthe cloud is closer to homogeneous, and more sensitive to\nclump radius than f . As a result, the temperature distribution is most sensitive to changes in f for f \u223c 0.1. While\n\n\f10\n\nS. D.

The deviation of the temperature distribution from\nan equivalent homogeneous model, as specified by \u03c6(f )2 /\u03c6max\n(see text) as a function of the filling factor, for models with rc =\n0.5 pc, and \u03c4\u0304 = 10.\n\nmany interpretations of filling factor are not driven by continuum observations, these results are relevant since one of\nthe dominant thermal regulators for the gas is collisions with\nthe dust \u2013 meaning that sensitivity to Tdust near f \u223c 0.1 can\nlead to sensitivity in line processes near f \u223c 0.1.\nAs a test, we have run additional models f = 0.03, and\nf = 0.2 for the model numbers 1x21. In order to quantify the\ndeviation from the homogenous\nmodel, we have calculated a\nP\nparameter, \u03c62 \u2261 N1\n(hT (ri )i \u2212 hThom (ri )i)2 /\u03c3(r)2hom . Here\nthe sum is over radial positions, hThom (ri )i is the spherical average temperature for the homogenous model, and\n\u03c3(r)hom is the uncertainty in the temperature distribution\nin the homogenous model. In Fig. 15 we plot the ratio of\nthe \u03c6(f )2 to the maximum value, \u03c62max as a function of filling factor. Notice that, indeed, the deviation from the homogeneous models peaks for intermediate values of f . In\nparticular, the greatest sensitivity to f occurs in the range\nf = 0.01 \u2212 0.1 \u2013 a resultin accord with the ranges of filling\nfactors commonly reported.\nWhen the optical depth increases to \u03c4\u0304 = 100, we find\nthat filling factor plays the dominant role over a much wider\nrange. As a result, the sensitivity to filling factor near f \u223c\n0.01 \u2212 0.1 for \u03c4\u0304 = 10 is not an effect here. At high optical\ndepth, we also find that the clump radius is not important.\nThis is due to the fact that f has a larger effect on FOS\nthan rc does, and that as optical depth increases, the clumps\nbecome more opaque, thereby blocking a higher fraction of\nthe impinging radiation.\n4.5\n\nRange of importance of FOS\n\nFrom the previous discussion, FOS is necessary to describe the local radiation field and heating within a clumpy\nmedium. Here we attempt to infer the strength of the effect\n\nFigure 16. Deviation of temperature for a given point from the\nspherical average, as a function of the FOS for that point. Each\ntenth point is plotted. The grid of models having \u03c4\u0304 =10 (i.e. models 1xx1) are all plotted. Notice the increased spread for FOS\n> 0.6 \u2212 0.8, and the correlation for FOS < 0.6 or so.\n\nof FOS on temperature. While this has been addressed in\npassing, here we collect and further distill that information\nto help draw more general conclusions.\nAs seen in Section 4.3.4 and Fig. 8, the greatest effect of\n\u03b8(FOS) is at large radii. We find that this is generally true\nacross our grid of models. As expected, these points tend to\nhave the highest FOS. Interestingly, however, the effect of\nFOS is on the situations where the FOS is relatively small.\nThis can be inferred in three ways.\nFirst, we note that the largest values of \u03b8(FOS) occur for\nthe models that have the lowest FOS. This can be indirectly\nseen in that the models with the largest \u03b8(FOS)/\u03b8(h\u03c4 i) in\nTable 2 tend to have the larger filling factors. As seen in\nFigs. 11 & 13, higher f corresponds to lower values of FOS.\nWe can roughly quantify this by saying that FOS is important for those regions where FOS \u223c 0.5 or so. To begin to\nquantify this we can consider the temperature distributions\nand deviations in Tables 3 & 4, together with the FOS values\nin Fig. 13. In particular, we note that meaningful differences\nin spherical average temperature occur between all models\nat the smallest clump radius, that essentially no variation\noccurs with filling factor for the largest clump radius, and\nthat meaningful variation may occur as one changes filling\nfactor at the intermediate clump radius. From Fig. 13 we\nsee that the largest clump radius has values of FOS > 0.5.\nOn the other hand, for the smallest clump radius models,\nFOS varies from \u223c 0.86 to \u223c 0.25 as one changes f . Finally,\nfor the intermediate clump radius models, as one changes\nfrom f = 0.01 to f = 0.1 FOS varies from \u223c 0.95 to \u223c 0.5,\nwith uncertain corresponding change in the temperature distribution. But, when the difference between f = 0.01 and\nf = 0.3 is considered, there is a meaningful temperature\nchange. Taken together, this suggests that variation in FOS\nfor FOS > 0.5 may not be as important as variations in FOS\nwhen FOS < 0.5 or so.\nA more direct comparison suggests that FOS always\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n\fClumping in star-forming regions\n\nFigure 17. Deviation of temperature for a given point from the\nspherical average, as a function of the FOS for that point. Each\ntenth point is plotted. The grid of models having \u03c4\u0304 =100 (i.e.\nmodels 1xx2) are all plotted. Notice the increased spread for FOS\n> 0.6 \u2212 0.8, and the correlation for FOS < 0.6 or so.\n\nplays some role, but that a change in FOS becomes increasingly important in determining the temperature for FOS\n< 0.6. For FOS > 0.6 \u2212 0.8, the spread in temperatures increases. To see this in Figs. 16 & 17 we have plotted the\nfractional deviation of the temperature of a point from the\nspherical average as a function of the FOS at that point\nfor all models in our grid. The points plotted cover all radii\nin the models. It is clear by inspection that FOS directly\ncorrelates with the temperature deviation. Interestingly, the\ncorrelation is strongest for FOS less than \u223c 0.6. On the\nother hand, for FOS > 0.6 \u2212 0.8, there does not appear to\nbe a direct relationship between FOS and temperature deviation. However, for the larger values of FOS the spread in\ntemperatures is indeed greater.\nTaken together, this agrees well with the idea of streaming of photons through holes in a clumpy medium. For models with a small average FOS, a position with a few extra\nlines of sight can receive significant additional heating. On\nthe other hand, when the FOS for a point is high, it is wellheated by the external radiation field. However, direct shadowing of a point by a nearby clump, and attenuation by\nthe (assumed) tenuous interclump medium can play roles.\nIn fact, for the high optical depth models (\u03c4\u0304 = 100), the\nranges of temperture deviations are smaller than for low optical depth models, due to the greater attenuation by the\ninterclump medium.\n\n5\n\nSHADOWING\n\nOne further impact of clumps is to directly shadow points\nbehind them, leading to lower temperatures. This effect can\nbe seen directly in Fig. 4. In this externally heated model,\npoints just interior to clumps are decreased in temperature\nrelative to equivalent points not directly behind clumps.\nTwo important questions arise: (1) over what length scale\nc 2005 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201312\n\n11\n\ndoes this effect hold?, and (2) is the cause a decrease in FOS\nfor these points?\nTo answer the first question, we have considered the\ntemperature distribution as a function of distance behind\nclumps. The temperature at these points is consistently\nlower than the spherical average by 5 \u2212 25 per cent. To identify the shadowinglengthscale, we determine the distance, d,\nbehind the clump at which the deviation is 1/2 the maximum. A fit of d of the form d = \u03b4 \u00d7 rc yields \u03b4 = 1.2 \u00b1 0.4.\nAs a result, we infer shadowing is important for lengthscale\nof \u223c 1.2 clump radii behind a clump.\nTo answer the second question \u2013 the role of FOS \u2013 we\ncan reconsider Fig. 6, which plots the FOS and temperature\nas functions of position along three axes for a representative\nmodel. Notice how well FOS correlates with temperature,\nespecially in the shadowed regions behind clumps. This is\nhighly suggestive that FOS is the determining factor in shadowing. More quantitatively, we can consider the fraction of\nsky closed (FCS) by the clump. Using the previous notation, the fraction of closed sky is FCS = rc2 /(4d2 ) = 1/4\u03b4 2 .\nFor \u03b4 = 1.2, this yields FCSclump = 0.17, and a corresponding FOS of 0.83. This is near the limit of FOS= 0.8 we\ninferred previously above which the sky is sufficiently open\nfor the temperature to be insensitive to FOS. As a result,\nwe conclude that FOS (and thus actual shadowing) is the\nimportant mechanism directly behind a clump.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have constructed a grid of three-dimensional continuum\nradiative transfer models for clumpy star-forming regions,\nin order to better delineate and understand the effects of\nclumping on radiative transfer. Based upon this work, we\nfind that:\n1. The inclusion of clumps \u2013 even for a constant total\nmass / average optical depth \u2013 can significantly change the\ntemperature distribution within the cloud. These differences\nin temperature can be in excess of 60 per cent, and are due\nto the lower effective optical depth for clumpy media relative\nto equivalent homogeneous media (Sect. 3).\n2. The centers of clumps are warmer than would be expected on energy density grounds due to radiation trapping\n(Sect. 4.1).\n3. The temperature distribution is driven by the ability\nof radiation to penetrate, and is thus strongly correlated\nwith the angle-averaged attenuation he\u2212\u03c4 i (Sect. 4.2).\n4. While there exists an anti-correlation of temperature\nwith density (Sect. 4.1), the correlation with fraction of open\nsky (FOS) is stronger (Sect. 4.2).\n5. We find only a weak correlation of dust temperature\nwith angle-averaged optical depth, h\u03c4 i (Sect. 4.3.2). On the\nother hand, there exists a significant correlation between\ndust temperature and FOS (Sect. 4.3.3). This is interpreted\nas the dominance of streaming of radiation between clumps\nover diffusion through them in determining the radiation\nfield (Sect. 4.3.4).\n6. The dependence of radiation penetration on FOS versus h\u03c4 i is robust. The stronger correlation with FOS versus\nh\u03c4 i extends throughout the grid of models and for different\nrealizations of clump distribution (Sect. 4.3.4).\n\n\f12\n\nS. D. Doty et al.\n\n7. While h\u03c4 i may be an effect near the cloud edges, FOS\nis more important deeper into the cloud (Sect. 4.3.4).\n8. At low face-averaged optical depths, \u03c4\u0304 = 10, filling\nfactor is more important for small clump radii than large\nclump radii. At large optical depths \u03c4\u0304 = 100, filling factor\nis the dominant effect for all situations (Sect. 4.4.1).\n9. The effects of clump size are only important for the\nlargest filling factors (f = 0.3) and lower optical depths\n\u03c4\u0304 = 10. It is unimportant for lower filling factors or larger\noptical depths, \u03c4\u0304 = 100 (Sect. 4.4.2).\n10. For lower face-average optical depths, \u03c4\u0304 = 10, filling\nfactor is most important in determining the temperature\ndistribution for f = 0.01 \u2212 0.1, in accordance with most\nobservations. For very opaque clouds with \u03c4\u0304 = 100, filling\nfactor is important over a larger range (Sect. 4.4.3).\n11. FOS increases as clump radius increases and as filling factor decreases (Sect. 4.4).\n12. The variation of temperature with FOS is more significant in cases of small FOS (high filling factor or small\nclump radii), while h\u03c4 i is relatively unimportant (Sect. 4.5).\n13. For FOS > 0.6 \u2212 0.8 the sky is sufficiently open that\nthere is little dependence of temperature on FOS (Sect. 4.5).\n14. Clumps can directly shadow the regions behind\nthem. On average, this regime extends to distance \u223c 1.2\ntimes the clump radius behind the clump, where the clump\nonly subtends a small fraction of the sky (Sect. 5).\n\nKlapp, J., & Sigalotti, L. D.
