We prove that the b-adic expansion of every irrational algebraic number cannot have low complexity.\nFurthermore, we establish that irrational morphic numbers are transcendental, for a wide class of morphisms. In particular, irrational automatic\nnumbers are transcendental. Our main tool is a new, combinatorial transcendence criterion.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet b \u2265 2 be an integer. The b-adic expansion of every rational number is eventually\nperiodic, but what can be said on the b-adic expansion of an irrational algebraic number?\nThis question was addressed for the first time by \u00c9mile Borel [11], who made the conjecture\nthat such an expansion should satisfies the same laws as do almost all real numbers. In\nparticular, it is expected that every irrational algebraic number is normal in base b. Recall\nthat a real number \u03b8 is called normal in base b if, for any positive integer n, each one of\nthe bn blocks of length n on the alphabet {0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1} occurs in the b-adic expansion\nof \u03b8 with the same frequency 1/bn . This conjecture is reputed to be out of reach: we even\n\u221a\ndo not know whether the digit 7 occurs infinitely often in the decimal expansion of 2.\nHowever, some (very) partial results have been established.\nAs usual, we measure the complexity of an infinite word u = u1 u2 . . . defined on a\nfinite alphabet by counting the number p(n) of distinct blocks of length n occurring in the\nword u. In particular, the b-adic expansion of every real number normal in base b satisfies\np(n) = bn for any positive integer n. Using a clever reformulation of a theorem of Ridout\n[31], Ferenczi and Mauduit [18] established the transcendence of the real numbers whose badic expansion is a non eventually periodic sequence of minimal complexity, that is, which\nsatisfies p(n) = n + 1 for every n \u2265 1 (such a sequence is called a Sturmian sequence, see\nthe seminal papers by Morse and Hedlund [26, 27]). The combinatorial criterion given\nin [18] has been used subsequently to exhibit further examples of transcendental numbers\nwith low complexity [3, 6, 4, 32]. It also implies that the complexity of the b-adic expansion\nof every irrational algebraic number satisfies lim inf n\u2192\u221e (p(n) \u2212 n) = +\u221e. Although this\nis very far away from what is expected, no better result is known.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification : 11J81, 11A63, 11B85, 68R15.\n1\n\n\fIn 1965, Hartmanis and Stearns [19] proposed an alternative approach for the notion\nof complexity of real numbers, by emphasizing the quantitative aspect of the notion of\ncalculability introduced by Turing [39]. According to them, a real number is said to be\ncomputable in time T (n) if there exists a multitape Turing machine which gives the first nth terms of its binary expansion in (at most) T (n) operations. The 'simpler' real numbers\nin that sense, that is, the numbers for which one can choose T (n) = O(n), are said to be\ncomputable in real time. Rational numbers share clearly this property. The problem of\nHartmanis and Stearns, to which a negative answer is expected, is the following: do there\nexist irrational algebraic numbers which are computable in real time? In 1968, Cobham\n[13] suggested to restrict this problem to a particular class of Turing machines, namely\nto the case of finite automata (see Section 3 for a definition). After several attempts by\nCobham [13] in 1968 and by Loxton and van der Poorten [21] in 1982, Loxton and van\nder Poorten [22] finally claimed to have completely solved the restricted problem in 1988.\nMore precisely, they asserted that the b-adic expansion of every irrational algebraic number\ncannot be generated by a finite automaton. The proof proposed in [22], which rests on a\nmethod introduced by Mahler [23, 24, 25], contains unfortunately a rather serious gap, as\nexplained by Becker [8] (see also [40]). Furthermore, the combinatorial criterion established\nin [18] is too weak to imply this statement, often referred to as the conjecture of Loxton\nand van der Poorten.\nIn the present paper, we prove new results concerning both notions of complexity. Our\nTheorem 1 provides a sharper lower estimate for the complexity of the b-adic expansion\nof every irrational algebraic number. We are still far away from proving that such an\nexpansion is normal, but we considerably improve upon the earlier known results. We\nfurther establish (Theorem 2) the conjecture of Loxton and van der Poorten, namely that\nirrational automatic numbers are transcendental. Our proof yields more general statements\nand allows us to confirm that irrational morphic numbers are transcendental, for a wide\nclass of morphisms (Theorems 3 and 4).\nWe derive Theorems 1 to 4 from a refinement (Theorem 5) of the combinatorial criterion from [18], that we obtain as a consequence of the Schmidt Subspace Theorem.\nThroughout the present paper, we adopt the following convention. We use small\nletters (a, u, etc.) to denote letters from some finite alphabet A. We use capital letters\n(U , V , W , etc.) to denote finite words. We use bold small letters (a, u, etc.) to denote\ninfinite sequence of letters. We often identify the sequence a = (ak )k\u22651 with the infinite\nword a1 a2 . . ., also called a. This should not cause any confusion.\nOur paper is organized as follows. The main results are stated in Section 2 and\nproved in Section 5. Some definitions from automata theory and combinatorics on words\nare recalled in Section 3. Section 4 is devoted to the new transcendence criterion and its\nproof. Finally, we show in Section 6 that the Hensel expansion of every irrational algebraic\np-adic number cannot have a low complexity, and we conclude in Section 7 by miscellaneous\nremarks.\nSome of the results of the present paper were announced in [2].\nAcknowledgements. We would like to thank Guy Barat and Florian Luca for their\nuseful comments. The first author is also most grateful to Jean-Paul Allouche and Val\u00e9rie\nBerth\u00e9 for their constant support.\n2\n\n\f2. Main results\nAs mentioned in the first part of the Introduction, we measure the complexity of a\nreal number written in some integral base b \u2265 2 by counting, for any positive integer n, the\nnumber p(n) of distinct blocks of n digits (on the alphabet {0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1}) occurring in\nits b-adic expansion. The fonction p is commonly called the complexity function. It follows\nfrom results of Ferenczi and Mauduit [18] (see also [4], Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 3) that the complexity\nfunction p of every irrational algebraic number satisfies\nlim inf (p(n) \u2212 n) = +\u221e.\n\n(1)\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nAs far as we are aware, no better result is known, although it has been proved [3, 6, 32]\nthat some special real numbers with linear complexity are transcendental.\nOur first result is a considerable improvement of (1).\nTheorem 1. Let b \u2265 2 be an integer. The complexity function of the b-adic expansion of\nevery irrational algebraic number satisfies\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\np(n)\n= +\u221e.\nn\n\nIt immediately follows from Theorem 1 that every irrational real number with sublinear complexity (i.e., such that p(n) = O(n)) is transcendental. However, Theorem 1 is\nslightly sharper, as is illustrated by an example due to Ferenczi [17]: he established the\nexistence of a sequence on a finite alphabet whose complexity function p satisfies\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\np(n)\n= 2 and\nn\n\nlim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\np(n)\n= +\u221e\nnt\n\nfor any t > 1.\n\nMost of the previous attempts towards a proof of the conjecture of Loxton and van der\nPoorten have been made via the Mahler method [21, 22, 8, 29]. We stress that Becker [8]\nestablished that, P\nfor any given non-eventually periodic automatic sequence u = u1 u2 . . .,\nthe real number k\u22651 uk b\u2212k is transcendental, provided that the integer b is sufficiently\nlarge (in terms of u). Since the complexity function p of any automatic sequence satisfies\np(n) = O(n) (see Cobham [14]), Theorem 1 confirms straightforwardly this conjecture.\nTheorem 2. Let b \u2265 2 be an integer. The b-adic expansion of any irrational algebraic\nnumber cannot be generated by a finite automaton. In other words, irrational automatic\nnumbers are transcendental.\nAlthough Theorem 2 is a direct consequence of Theorem 1, we give in Section 5 a\nshort proof of it, that rests on another result of Cobham [14].\nTheorem 2 establishes a particular case of the following widely believed conjecture\n(see e.g. [5]). The definitions of morphism, recurrent morphism, and morphic number are\nrecalled in Section 3.\n3\n\n\fConjecture. Irrational morphic numbers are transcendental.\nOur method allows us to confirm this conjecture for a wide class of morphisms.\nTheorem 3. Binary algebraic irrational numbers cannot be generated by a morphism.\nAs observed by Allouche and Zamboni [6], it follows from [18] combined with a result of\nBerstel and S\u00e9\u00e9bold [9] that binary irrational numbers which are fixed point of a primitive\nmorphism or of a morphism of constant length \u2265 2 are transcendental. Our Theorem 3 is\nmuch more general.\nRecently, by a totally different method, Bailey, Borwein, Crandall, and Pomerance [7]\nestablished new, interesting results on the density of the digits in the binary expansion of\nalgebraic numbers.\nFor b-adic expansions with b \u2265 3, we obtain a similar result as in Theorem 3, but an\nadditional assumption is needed.\nTheorem 4. Let b \u2265 3 be an integer. The b-adic expansion of an algebraic irrational\nnumber cannot be generated by a recurrent morphism.\nUnfortunately, we are unable to prove that ternary algebraic numbers cannot be generated by a morphism. Consider for instance the fixed point\nu = 01212212221222212222212222221222 . . .\nX\nof the morphism defined by 0 \u2192 012, 1 \u2192 12, 2 \u2192 2, and set \u03b1 =\nuk 3\u2212k . Our method\nk\u22651\n\ndoes not apply to show the transcendence of \u03b1. Let us mention that this \u03b1 is known to be\ntranscendental: this is a consequence of deep transcendence results proved in [10] and in\n[15], concerning the values of theta series at algebraic points.\nThe proofs of Theorems 1 to 4 are given in Section 5. The key point for them is\na new transcendence criterion, derived from the Schmidt Subspace Theorem, and stated\nin Section 4. Actually, we are able to deal also, under some conditions, with non-integer\nbases (see Theorems 5 and 5A). Given a real number \u03b2 > 1, we can expand in base \u03b2\nevery real number \u03be in (0, 1) thanks to the greedy algorithm: we then get the \u03b2-expansion\nof \u03be, introduced by Renyi [30]. Using Theorem 5, we easily see that the conclusions of\nTheorems 1 to 4 remain true with the expansion in base b replaced by the \u03b2-expansion\nwhen \u03b2 is a Pisot or a Salem number. Recall that a Pisot (resp. Salem) number is a real\nalgebraic integer > 1, whose complex conjugates lie inside the open unit disc (resp. inside\nthe closed unit disc, with at least one of them on the unit circle). In particular, any integer\nb \u2265 2 is a Pisot number. For instance, we get the following result.\n\nTheorem 1A. Let \u03b2 > 1 be a Pisot or a Salem number. The complexity function of the\n\u03b2-expansion of every algebraic number in (0, 1) \\ Q(\u03b2) satisfies\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\np(n)\n= +\u221e.\nn\n\nLikewise, we can also state Theorems 2A, 3A, and 4A accordingly: Theorems 1 to\n4 deal with algebraic irrational numbers, while Theorems 1A to 4A deal with algebraic\nnumbers in (0, 1) which do not lie in the number field generated by \u03b2.\n4\n\n\fMoreover, our method also allows us to prove that p-adic irrational numbers whose\nHensel expansions have low complexity are transcendental, see Section 6.\n3. Finite automata and morphic sequences\nIn this Section, we gather classical definitions from automata theory and combinatorics\non words.\nFinite automata and automatic sequences. Let k be an integer with k \u2265 2. We denote by\n\u03a3k the set {0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1}. A k-automaton is defined as a 6-tuple\nA = (Q, \u03a3k , \u03b4, q0 , \u2206, \u03c4 ) ,\nwhere Q is a finite set of states, \u03a3k is the input alphabet, \u03b4 : Q \u00d7 \u03a3k \u2192 Q is the transition\nfunction, q0 is the initial state, \u2206 is the output alphabet and \u03c4 : Q \u2192 \u2206 is the output\nfunction.\nFor a state q in Q and for a finite word W = w1 w2 . . . wn on the alphabet \u03a3k , we define\nrecursively \u03b4(q, W ) by \u03b4(q, W ) = \u03b4(\u03b4(q, w1 w2 . . . wn\u22121 ), wn ). Let n \u2265 0 be an integer and\nr\nX\nr\nlet wr wr\u22121 . . . w1 w0 in (\u03a3k ) be the k-ary expansion of n; thus, n =\nwi k i . We denote\ni=0\n\nby Wn the word w0 w1 . . . wr . Then, a sequence a = (an )n\u22650 is said to be k-automatic if\nthere exists a k-automaton A such that an = \u03c4 (\u03b4(q0 , Wn )) for all n \u2265 0.\n\nA classical example of a 2-automatic sequence is given by the binary Thue-Morse\nsequence a = (an )n\u22650 = 0110100110010 . . . This sequence is defined as follows: an is equal\nto 0 (resp. to 1) if the sum of the digits in the binary expansion of n is even (resp. is odd).\nIt is easy to check that this sequence can be generated by the 2-automaton\n\u0001\nA = {q0 , q1 }, {0, 1}, \u03b4, q0, {0, 1}, \u03c4 ,\nwhere\n\n\u03b4(q0 , 0) = \u03b4(q1 , 1) = q0 ,\n\n\u03b4(q0 , 1) = \u03b4(q1 , 0) = q1 ,\n\nand \u03c4 (q0 ) = 0, \u03c4 (q1 ) = 1.\nMorphisms. For a finite set A, we denote by A\u2217 the free monoid generated by A. The\nempty word \u03b5 is the neutral element of A\u2217 . Let A and B be two finite sets. An application\nfrom A to B\u2217 can be uniquely extended to an homomorphism between the free monoids\nA\u2217 and B\u2217 . We call morphism from A to B such an homomorphism.\nSequences generated by a morphism. A morphism \u03c6 from A into itself is said to be prolongable if there exists a letter a such that \u03c6(a) = aW , where W is a non-empty word\nsuch that \u03c6k (W ) 6= \u03b5 for every k \u2265 0. In that case, the sequence of finite words (\u03c6k (a))k\u22651\nconverges in AN (endowed with the product topology of the discrete topology on each copy\nof A) to an infinite word a. This infinite word is clearly a fixed point for \u03c6 and we say\nthat a is generated by the morphism \u03c6. If, moreover, every letter occurring in a occurs at\n5\n\n\fleast twice, then we say that a is generated by a recurrent morphism. If the alphabet A\nhas two letters, then we say that a is generated by a binary morphism. More generally, an\ninfinite sequence a in AN is said to be morphic if there exist a sequence u generated by a\nmorphism defined over an alphabet B and a morphism from B to A such that a = \u03c6(u).\nFor instance, the Fibonacci morphism \u03c3 defined from the alphabet {0, 1} into itself\nby \u03c3(0) = 01 and \u03c3(1) = 0 is a binary, recurrent morphism which generates the Fibonacci\ninfinite word\na = lim \u03c3 n (0) = 010010100100101001 . . .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nThis infinite word is an example of a Sturmian sequence and its complexity function satisfies\nthus p(n) = n + 1 for every positive integer n.\nAutomatic and morphic real numbers. Following the previous definitions, we say that a real\nnumber \u03b1 is automatic (respectively, generated by a morphism, generated by a recurrent\nmorphism, or morphic) if there exists an integer b \u2265 2 such that the b-adic expansion of \u03b1\nis automatic (respectively, generated by a morphism, generated by a recurrent morphism,\nor morphic).\nA classical example of binary automatic number is given by\nX 1\n22 n\n\nn\u22651\n\nwhich is transcendental, as proved by Kempner [20].\n4. A transcendence criterion for stammering sequences\nFirst, we need to introduce some notation. Let A be a finite set. The length of a\nword W on the alphabet A, that is, the number of letters composing W , is denoted by\n|W |. For any positive integer l, we write W l for the word W . . . W (l times repeated\nconcatenation of the word W ). More generally, for any positive real number x, we denote\nby W x the word W \u230ax\u230b W \u2032 , where W \u2032 is the prefix of W of length \u2308(x \u2212 \u230ax\u230b)|W |\u2309. Here,\nand in all what follows, \u230ay\u230b and \u2308y\u2309 denote, respectively, the integer part and the upper\ninteger part of the real number y. Let a = (ak )k\u22651 be a sequence of elements from A, that\nwe identify with the infinite word a1 a2 . . . Let w > 1 be a real number. We say that a\nsatisfies Condition (\u2217)w if a is not eventually periodic and if there exist two sequences of\nfinite words (Un )n\u22651 , (Vn )n\u22651 such that:\n(i) For any n \u2265 1, the word Un Vnw is a prefix of the word a;\n\n(ii) The sequence (|Un |/|Vn |)n\u22651 is bounded from above;\n\n(iii) The sequence (|Vn |)n\u22651 is increasing.\n\nAs suggested to us by Guy Barat, a sequence satisfying Condition (\u2217)w for some w > 1\nmay be called a stammering sequence.\n6\n\n\fTheorem 5. Let \u03b2 > 1 be a Pisot or a Salem number. Let a = (ak )k\u22651 be a bounded\nsequence of rational integers. If there exists a real number w > 1 such that a satisfies\nCondition (\u2217)w , then the real number\n+\u221e\nX\nak\n\u03b1 :=\n\u03b2k\nk=1\n\neither belongs to Q(\u03b2), or is transcendental.\nThe proof of Theorem 5 rests on the Schmidt Subspace Theorem [37] (see also [38]),\nand more precisely on a p-adic generalization due to Schlickewei [34, 35] and Evertse [16].\nNote that the particular case when \u03b2 is an integer \u2265 2 was proved in [2]. Note also that\nAdamczewski [1] proved that, under a stronger assumption on the sequence (ak )k\u22651 , the\nnumber \u03b1 defined in the statement of Theorem 5 is transcendental.\nRemarks.\n\u2022 Theorem 5 is considerably stronger than the criterion of Ferenczi and Mauduit [18]:\nour assumption w > 1 replaces their assumption w > 2. This type of condition is rather\nflexible, compared with the Mahler method, for which a functional equation is needed. For\ninstance, the conclusion of Theorem 5 also holds if the sequence a is an unbounded sequence\nof integers that does not increase too rapidly. Nevertheless, one should acknowledge that,\nwhen\nbe applied, the Mahler method gives the transcendence of the infinite series\nP+\u221e it can\n\u2212k\nfor every algebraic number \u03b2 such that this series converges.\nk=1 ak \u03b2\n\n\u2022 We emphasize that if a sequence u satisfies Condition (\u2217)w and if \u03c6 is a non-erasing\nmorphism (that is, if the image by \u03c6 of any letter has length at least 1), then \u03c6(u) satisfies\nCondition (\u2217)w , as well. This observation is used in the proof of Theorem 2.\n\n\u2022 If \u03b2 is an algebraic number which is neither a Pisot, nor a Salem number, it is still\npossible to get a transcendence criterion using the approach followed for proving Theorem\n5. However, the assumption w > 1 should then be replaced by a weaker one, involving the\nMahler measure of \u03b2 and lim supn\u2192\u221e |Un |/|Vn |. Furthermore, the same approach shows\nthat the full strength of Theorem 5 holds when \u03b2 is a Gaussian integer. More details will\nbe given in a subsequent work.\nBefore beginning the proof of Theorem 5, we quote a version of the Schmidt Subspace\nTheorem, as formulated by Evertse [16].\nWe normalize absolute values and heights as follows. Let K be an algebraic number\nfield of degree d. Let M (K) denote the set of places on K. For x in K and a place v in\nM (K), define the absolute value |x|v by\n(i) |x|v = |\u03c3(x)|1/d\n\nif v corresponds to the embedding \u03c3 : K \u0592\u2192 R;\n\n(ii) |x|v = |\u03c3(x)|\n= |\u03c3(x)|2/d\nbeddings \u03c3, \u03c3 : K \u0592\u2192 C;\n2/d\n\n(iii) |x|v = (N p)\u2212ordp (x)/d\n\nif v corresponds to the pair of conjugate complex em-\n\nif v corresponds to the prime ideal p of OK .\n7\n\n\fThese absolute values satisfy the product formula\nY\n|x|v = 1\nfor x in K\u2217 .\nv\u2208M (K)\n\nLet x = (x1 , . . . , xn ) be in Kn with x 6= 0. For a place v in M (K), put\n|x|v =\n\n\u0012X\nn\n\n|xi |2d\nv\n\n|x|v =\n\n\u0012X\nn\n\n|xi |dv\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u00131/(2d)\n\n\u00131/d\n\nif v is real infinite;\n\nif v is complex infinite;\n\n|x|v = max{|x1 |v , . . . , |xn |v }\n\nif v is finite.\n\nNow define the height of x by\nH(x) = H(x1 , . . . , xn ) =\n\nY\n\nv\u2208M (K)\n\n|x|v .\n\nWe stress that H(x) depends only on x and not on the choice of the number field K\ncontaining the coordinates of x, see e.g. [16].\nWe use the following formulation of the Subspace Theorem over number fields. In the\nsequel, we assume that the algebraic closure of K is Q. We choose for every place v in\nM (K) a continuation of | * |v to Q, that we denote also by | * |v .\nTheorem E. Let K be an algebraic number field. Let m \u2265 2 be an integer. Let S be a\nfinite set of places on K containing all infinite places. For each v in S, let L1,v , . . . , Lm,v\nbe linear forms with algebraic coefficients and with\nrank {L1,v , . . . , Lm,v } = m.\nLet \u03b5 be real with 0 < \u03b5 < 1. Then, the set of solutions x in Km to the inequality\nm\nY Y\n|Li,v (x)|v\n\u2264 H(x)\u2212m\u2212\u03b5\n|x|v\ni=1\n\nv\u2208S\n\nlies in finitely many proper subspaces of Km .\nFor a proof of Theorem E, the reader is directed to [16], where a quantitative version is\nestablished (in the sense that one bounds explicitly the number of exceptional subspaces).\nWe now turn to the proof of Theorem 5. Keep the notation and the assumptions of\nthis theorem. Assume that the parameter w > 1 is fixed, as well as the sequences (Un )n\u22651\nand (Vn )n\u22651 occurring in the definition of Condition (\u2217)w . Set also rn = |Un | and sn = |Vn |\nfor any n \u2265 1. We aim to prove that the real number\n+\u221e\nX\nak\n\u03b1 :=\n\u03b2k\nk=1\n\n8\n\n\feither lies in Q(\u03b2) or is transcendental. The key fact is the observation that \u03b1 admits\ninfinitely many good approximants in the number field Q(\u03b2) obtained by truncating its\nexpansion and completing it by periodicity. Precisely, for any positive integer n, we define\n(n)\nthe sequence (bk )k\u22651 by\n(n)\n\nbh = a h\n\nfor 1 \u2264 h \u2264 rn + sn ,\n\n(n)\n\nbrn +h+jsn = arn +h\n\nfor 1 \u2264 h \u2264 sn and j \u2265 0.\n\n(n)\n\nThe sequence (bk )k\u22651 is eventually periodic, with preperiod Un and with period Vn . Set\n\u03b1n =\n\n+\u221e (n)\nX\nbk\n,\n\u03b2k\nk=1\n\nand observe that\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1n =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n(n)\n\nk=rn +\u2308wsn \u2309+1\n\na k \u2212 bk\n*\n\u03b2k\n\n(2)\n\nLemma 1.

We assume that \u03b1 is algebraic, and we\nconsider the following linear forms, in three variables and with algebraic coefficients. For\n9\n\n\fthe place v corresponding to the embedding of K defined by \u03b2 \u0592\u2192 \u03b2, set L1,v (x, y, z) = x,\nL2,v (x, y, z) = y, and L3,v (x, y, z) = \u03b1x + \u03b1y + z. It follows from (2) and Lemma 1 that\n|L3,v (\u03b2 rn +sn , \u2212\u03b2 rn , \u2212Pn (\u03b2))|v = |\u03b1(\u03b2 rn (\u03b2 sn \u2212 1)) \u2212 Pn (\u03b2)|1/d \u226a\n\n1\n\u03b2 (w\u22121)sn /d\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere we have chosen the continuation of | * |v to Q defined by |x|v = |x|1/d . Here and\nthroughout this Section, the constants implied by the Vinogradov symbol \u226a depend (at\nmost) on \u03b1, \u03b2, and maxk\u22651 |ak |, but are independent of n.\n\u2032\nDenote by S\u221e\nthe set of all other infinite places on K and by S0 the set of all finite\nplaces on K dividing \u03b2. Observe that S0 is empty if \u03b2 is an algebraic unit. For any v in\n\u2032\nS0 \u222a S\u221e\n, set L1,v (x, y, z) = x, L2,v (x, y, z) = y, and L3,v (x, y, z) = z. Denote by S the\nunion of S0 and the infinite places on K. Clearly, for any v in S, the forms L1,v , L2,v and\nL3,v are linearly independent.\nTo simplify the exposition, set\nxn = (\u03b2 rn +sn , \u2212\u03b2 rn , \u2212Pn (\u03b2)).\nWe wish to estimate the product\n3\nY Y\nY\n|Li,v (xn )|v\n|L3,v (xn )|v\n\u03a0 :=\n=\n|\u03b2 rn +sn |v |\u03b2 rn |v\n|xn |v\n|xn |3v\ni=1\nv\u2208S\n\nv\u2208S\n\nfrom above. By the product formula and the definition of S, we immediately get that\n\u03a0=\n\nY |L3,v (xn )|v\n.\n|xn |3v\n\n(4)\n\nv\u2208S\n\nSince the polynomial Pn (X) has integer coefficients and since \u03b2 is an algebraic integer, we\nhave |L3,v (xn )|v = |Pn (\u03b2)|v \u2264 1 for any place v in S0 . Furthermore, as the conjugates of\n\u2032\n\u03b2 have moduli at most 1, we have for any infinite place v in S\u221e\n|L3,v (xn )|v \u226a (rn + sn )dv /d ,\nwhere dv = 1 or 2 according as v is real infinite or complex infinite, respectively. Together\nwith (3) and (4), this gives\nY\n\u03a0 \u226a (rn + sn )(d\u22121)/d \u03b2 \u2212(w\u22121)sn /d\n|xn |\u22123\nv\nv\u2208S\n\n\u226a (rn + sn )\n\n(d\u22121)/d\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u2212(w\u22121)sn /d\n\nH(xn )\u22123 ,\n\nsince |xn |v = 1 if v does not belong to S.\nFurthermore, it follows from Lemma 1 and from the fact that the moduli of the\ncomplex conjugates of \u03b2 are at most 1 that\nH(xn ) \u226a (rn + sn )d \u03b2 (rn +sn )/d .\n10\n\n\fConsequently, we infer from Condition (\u2217)w that\n3\nY Y\n|Li,v (xn )|v\n\u226a (rn + sn )dw H(xn )\u2212(w\u22121)sn /(rn +sn ) H(xn )\u22123\n|x\n|\nn v\ni=1\n\nv\u2208S\n\n\u226a H(xn )\u22123\u2212\u03b5 ,\nfor some positive real number \u03b5.\nIt then follows from Theorem E that the points (\u03b2 rn +sn , \u2212\u03b2 rn , \u2212Pn (\u03b2)) lie in a finite\nnumber of proper subspaces of K3 . Thus, there exist a non-zero triple (x0 , y0 , z0 ) in K3\nand infinitely many integers n such that\nx0 \u2212 y 0\n\n\u03b2 rn\n\u03b2 rn +sn\n\n\u2212 z0\n\nPn (\u03b2)\n= 0.\n\u03b2 rn +sn\n\nTaking the limit along this subsequence of integers and noting that (sn )n\u22651 tends to infinity,\nwe get that x0 = z0 \u03b1. Thus, \u03b1 belongs to K = Q(\u03b2), as asserted.\nLet us restrict our attention to the case when \u03b2 is a Pisot number. Dealing with the\n\u03b2-expansions of real numbers (instead of arbitrary power series in \u03b2) allows us to improve\nthe conclusion of Theorem 5.\nTheorem 5A. Let \u03b2 > 1 be a Pisot number. Let \u03b1 be in (0, 1), and consider its \u03b2expansion\n+\u221e\nX\nak\n.\n\u03b1 :=\n\u03b2k\nk=1\n\nIf (ak )k\u22651 satisfies Condition (\u2217)w for some real number w > 1, then \u03b1 is transcendental.\nProof. By a result of K. Schmidt [36], we know that the \u03b2-expansion of every element of\nQ(\u03b2) \u2229 (0, 1) is eventually periodic. Thus, it does not satisfy Condition (\u2217)w . We conclude\nby applying Theorem 5.\nNote that for a Salem number \u03b2, it is an important open problem to decide whether\nevery element of Q(\u03b2) \u2229 (0, 1) has an eventually periodic \u03b2-expansion.\n5. Proofs of Theorems 1 to 4\nWe begin by a short proof of Theorem 2.\nProof of Theorem 2. Let a = (ak )k\u22651 be a non-eventually periodic automatic sequence\ndefined on a finite alphabet A. Recall that a morphism is called uniform if the images of\neach letter have the same length. Following Cobham [14], there exist a morphism \u03c6 from\nan alphabet B = {1, 2, . . . , r} to the alphabet A and an uniform morphism \u03c3 from B into\nitself such that a = \u03c6(u), where u is a fixed point for \u03c3. Observe first that the sequence a\n11\n\n\fsatisfies Condition (\u2217)w if this is the case for u. Further, by the Dirichlet Schubfachprinzip,\nthe prefix of length r + 1 of u can be written under the form W1 uW2 uW3 , where u is a\nletter and W1 , W2 , W3 are (possibly empty) finite words. We check that the assumptions\nof Theorem 1 are satisfied by u with the sequences (Un )n\u22651 and (Vn )n\u22651 defined for any\nn \u2265 1 by Un = \u03c3 n (W1 ) and Vn = \u03c3 n (uW2 ). Indeed, since \u03c3 is a morphism of constant\nlength, we get, on the one hand, that\n|W1 |\n|Un |\n\u2264\n\u2264r\u22121\n|Vn |\n1 + |W2 |\nand, on the other hand, that \u03c3 n (u) is a prefix of Vn of length at least 1/r times the length\nof Vn . It follows that Condition (\u2217)1+1/r is satisfied by the sequence u, and thus by our\nsequence a (here, we use the observation we made in Section 4). Let b \u2265 2 bePan integer.\n+\u221e\nBy applying Theorem 5 with \u03b2 = b, we conclude that the automatic number k=1 ak b\u2212k\nis transcendental.\nProof of Theorem 1. Let \u03b1 be an irrational number. Without any loss of generality,\nwe assume that \u03b1 is in (0, 1) and we denote by 0.u1 u2 . . . uk . . . its b-adic expansion. The\nsequence (uk )k\u22651 takes its values in {0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1} and is not eventually periodic. We\nassume that there exists an integer \u03ba \u2265 2 such that the complexity function p of (uk )k\u22651\nsatisfies\np(n) \u2264 \u03ban\nfor infinitely many integers n \u2265 1,\nand we shall derive that Condition (\u2217)w is then fulfilled by the sequence (uk )k\u22651 for a\nsuitable w > 1. By Theorem 5, this will imply that \u03b1 is transcendental.\nLet nk be an integer with p(nk ) \u2264 \u03bank . Denote by U (l) the prefix of u := u1 u2 . . . of\nlength l. By the Dirichlet Schubfachprinzip, there exists (at least) one word Mk of length\nnk which has (at least) two occurrences in U ((\u03ba + 1)nk ). Thus, there are (possibly empty)\nwords Ak , Bk , Ck and Dk , such that\nU ((\u03ba + 1)nk ) = Ak Mk Ck Dk = Ak Bk Mk Dk\n\nand\n\n|Bk | \u2265 1.\n\nWe observe that |Ak | \u2264 \u03bank . We have to distinguish three cases:\n(i) |Bk | > |Mk |;\n(ii) \u2308|Mk |/3\u2309 \u2264 |Bk | \u2264 |Mk |;\n(iii) 1 \u2264 |Bk | < \u2308|Mk |/3\u2309.\n(i). Under this assumption, there exists a word Ek such that\nU ((\u03ba + 1)nk ) = Ak Mk Ek Mk Dk .\nSince |Ek | \u2264 (\u03ba \u2212 1)|Mk |, the word Ak (Mk Ek )s with s = 1 + 1/\u03ba is a prefix of u. Furthermore, we observe that\n|Ak |\n.\n|Mk Ek | \u2265 |Mk | \u2265\n\u03ba\n12\n\n\f(ii). Under this assumption, there exist two words Ek and Fk such that\n1/3\n\n1/3\n\nU ((\u03ba + 1)nk ) = Ak Mk Ek Mk Ek Fk .\n1/3\n\nThus, the word Ak (Mk Ek )2 is a prefix of u. Furthermore, we observe that\n1/3\n\n|Mk Ek | \u2265\n\n|Ak |\n|Mk |\n\u2265\n.\n3\n3\u03ba\n\n(iii). In the present case, Bk is clearly a prefix of Mk , and we infer from Bk Mk = Mk Ck\nthat Bkt is a prefix of Mk , where t is the integer part of |Mk |/|Bk |. Observe that t \u2265 3.\nSetting s = \u230at/2\u230b, we see that Ak (Bks )2 is a prefix of u and\n|Bks | \u2265\n\n|Mk |\n|Ak |\n\u2265\n.\n4\n4\u03ba\n\nIn each of the three cases above, we have proved that there are finite words Uk , Vk\n1+1/\u03ba\nsuch that Uk Vk\nis a prefix of u and:\n\u2022 |Uk | \u2264 \u03bank ;\n\n\u2022 |Vk | \u2265 nk /4;\n\n\u2022 w \u2265 1 + 1/\u03ba > 1.\nConsequently, the sequence (|Uk |/|Vk |)k\u22651 is bounded from above by 4\u03ba. Furthermore, it\nfollows from the lower bound |Vk | \u2265 nk /4 that we may assume that the sequence (|Vk |)k\u22651\nis strictly increasing. This implies that the sequence u satisfies Condition (\u2217)1+1/\u03ba . By\napplying Theorem 5 with \u03b2 = b, we conclude that \u03b1 is transcendental.\nProof of Theorem 3. Let a be a sequence generated by a morphism \u03c6 defined on a finite\nalphabet A. For any positive integer n, there exists a letter an satisfying\n|\u03c6n (an )| = max{|\u03c6n (j)| : j \u2208 A}.\nThis implies the existence of a letter a in A and of a strictly increasing sequence of positive\nintegers (nk )k\u22651 such that for every k \u2265 1 we have\n|\u03c6nk (a)| = max{|\u03c6nk (j)| : j \u2208 A}.\nAssume from now on that A has two elements. Since the sequence a is not eventually\nperiodic there exist at least two occurrences in a of the two elements of A. In particular,\nthere exist at least two occurrences of the letter a in the sequence a. We can thus find\ntwo (possibly empty) finite words W1 and W2 such that W1 aW2 a is a prefix of a. We\ncheck that the assumptions of Theorem 5 are satisfied by a with the sequences (Uk )k\u22651\n13\n\n\fand (Vk )k\u22651 defined by Uk = \u03c6nk (W1 ) and Vk = \u03c6nk (aW2 ) for any k \u2265 1. Indeed, by\ndefinition of a, we have\n|Uk |\n\u2264 |W1 |\n|Vk |\nand \u03c6nk (a) is a prefix of Vk of length at least 1/(|W2 | + 1) times the length of Vk . It follows\nthat Condition (\u2217)w is satisfied by the sequence a with w = 1 + 1/(|W2 | + 1). We conclude\nby applying Theorem 5.\nProof of Theorem 4. Let a be a sequence generated by a recurrent morphism \u03c6 defined\non an alphabet A. As we have already noticed in the beginning of the proof of Theorem\n3, there exist a letter a and a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers (nk )k\u22651 such\nthat for every k \u2265 1 we have\n|\u03c6nk (a)| = max{|\u03c6nk (j)| : j \u2208 A}.\nSince by assumption the sequence a is recurrent there exist at least two occurrences of\nthe letter a. We then apply the same trick as in the proof of Theorem 3, and we again\nconclude by applying Theorem 5.\n\n6. Transcendence of p-adic numbers\nLet p be a prime number. As usual, we denote by Qp the field of p-adic numbers. We\ncall algebraic (resp. transcendental) any element of Qp which is algebraic (resp. transcendental) over Q. A suitable version of the Schmidt Subspace Theorem, due to Schlickewei\n[33], can be applied to derive a lower bound for the complexity of the Hensel expansion of\nevery irrational algebraic number in Qp .\nTheorem 1B. Let \u03b1 be an irrational algebraic number in Qp and denote by\n\u03b1=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nak pk\n\nk=\u2212m\n\nits Hensel expansion. Then, the complexity function p of the sequence (ak )k\u2265\u2212m satisfies\nlim inf\nn\u2192\u221e\n\np(n)\n= +\u221e.\nn\n\nLikewise (see Section 2), we can also state Theorems 2B, 3B and 4B. Theorem 1B\nfollows from Theorem 6 below, along with the arguments used in the proof of Theorem 1.\nThe method of proof of Theorem 5 applies to provide us with a new transcendence\ncriterion for p-adic numbers.\n14\n\n\fTheorem 6. Let p be a prime number and let (ak )k\u2265\u2212m be a sequence taking its values\nin {0, 1, . . . , p\u22121}. Let w > 1 be a real number. If the sequence (ak )k\u22651 satisfies Condition\n(\u2217)w , then the p-adic number\n+\u221e\nX\n\u03b1 :=\nak pk\nk=\u2212m\n\nis transcendental.\nWe briefly outline the proof of Theorem 6. Let p and (ak )k\u2265\u2212m be as in the statement\nof this theorem. There exist a parameter w > 1 and two sequences (Un )n\u22651 and (Vn )n\u22651\nof finite words as in the definition of Condition (\u2217)w . For any n \u2265 1, set rn = |Un | and\nsn = |Vn |. To establish Theorem 6, it is enough to prove that the p-adic number\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1 :=\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\nak pk\n\nk=1\n\nis transcendental. As in the proof of Theorem 5, the key fact is the observation that\n\u03b1\u2032 admits infinitely many good rational approximants obtained by truncating its Hensel\nexpansion and completing by periodicity. Precisely, for any positive integer n, we define\n(n)\nthe sequence (bk )k\u22651 exactly as in Section 4, and we set\n\u03b1n =\n\n+\u221e\nX\n\n(n)\n\nbk pk .\n\nk=1\n\nAn easy calculation shows that we have\n|\u03b1\u2032 \u2212 \u03b1n |p \u2264 p\u2212rn \u2212wsn ,\nwhere\npn =\n\n\u0012X\nrn\n\nk=1\n\n\u03b1n =\n\npn\n,\n\u22121\n\npsn\n\n\u0013\nsn\nX\nsn\narn +k prn +k .\nak p (p \u2212 1) \u2212\nk\n\nk=1\n\n\u2032\n\nAssuming that \u03b1 is an algebraic number in Qp , we apply Theorem 4.1 of Schlickewei\n[33] with the linear forms L1,p (x, y, z) = x, L2,p (x, y, z) = y, L3,p (x, y, z) = \u03b1\u2032 x + \u03b1\u2032 y + z,\nL1,\u221e (x, y, z) = x, L2,\u221e (x, y, z) = y, and L3,\u221e (x, y, z) = z. Setting xn := (psn , \u22121, \u2212pn ),\nwe get |L1,p (xn )|p = p\u2212sn and |L3,p (xn )|p \u2264 p\u2212rn \u2212wsn . We then follow the same lines\nas in the proof of Theorem 5, and we end up in a contradiction. This proves that \u03b1\u2032 is\ntranscendental.\n\n7. Concluding remarks\nIt is of interest to compare our result with a celebrated theorem of Christol, Kamae,\nMend\u00e8s France, and Rauzy [12] concerning algebraic elements of the field Fp ((X)). Their\n15\n\n\fresult asserts that, for any given prime number p, the\nsequence of integers u = (uk )k\u22651\nX\nis p-automatic if and only if the formal power series\nuk X k is algebraic over the field\nk\u22651\n\nof rational functions Fp (X). Thanks to Theorem 2, we thus easily derive the following\nstatement.\nTheorem\np be a prime number. The formal power\nX 7. Let b \u2265 2 be an integer\nX and\nuk\nk\nare both algebraic (over Fp (X) and over Q,\nseries\nuk X and the real number\nbk\nk\u22651\n\nk\u22651\n\nrespectively) if and only if they are rational.\nNote that Theorem 2B (see Section 6) naturally gives rise to a similar result where\nX uk\nX\nthe real number\nis\nreplaced\nby\nthe\nq-adic\nnumber\nuk q k , for an arbitrary prime\nbk\nk\u22651\n\nk\u22651\n\nnumber q. In particular, this holds true for q = p.\nIn 1991, Morton and Mourant [28] proved the following result: If k \u2265 2 is an integer,\nP is a non-zero pattern of digits in base k, and if ek,P,b (n) \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , b \u2212 1} counts the\nnumber of occurrences modulo b of P in the k-ary expansion of n, then the real number\n+\u221e\nX\nek,P,b (n)\n\u03b1(k, P, b) =\nis transcendental except when k = 3, P = 1 and b = 2. Moreover,\nn\nb\nn=0\nwe have \u03b1(3, 1, 2) = 2/3 in this particular case.\nThe proof given by Morton and Mourant is based on Theorem 2 and their paper refers\nto the work of Loxton and van der Poorten [22]. The present work validates their result.\nIt is interesting to remark that the simplest case k = 2, P = 1 and b = 2 corresponds\nto the well-known Thue\u2013Morse number, whose transcendence has been proved by Mahler\n[23]. The theorem of Morton and Mourant can thus be seen as a full generalisation of the\nMahler result.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] B. Adamczewski, Transcendance hh \u00e0 la Liouville\nAcad. Sci.
