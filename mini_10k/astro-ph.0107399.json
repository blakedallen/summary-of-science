Unique data on BV RI light curves of the optical transient (OT) of GRB 970508\nobtained with the 6-m telescope have been interpreted in the framework of the idea of a straightforward link between supernovae (SNe) and long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).

So, in addition to the\ncharacteristic \"shoulders\" on the light curves of the OTs of GRB 970228, GRB 980326, 990712,\n991208, more evidence of the link between GRBs and Type Ib/c SNe (or core-collapse SNe) was\nfound, which could be an argument in favor of the idea of massive stars as progenitors of long\nduration GRBs. If all or the main part of long duration GRBs are associated with the SNe, GRB\nhost galaxies (for ground-based observations, at least) must be dimmer than the peak magnitude\nof a SN. If some GRB/SN relation really exists, and if all or at least the main part of long duration\nGRBs are associated with SNe, then as a consequence we have a very strong \u03b3-ray beaming with\na solid angle of up to \u03a9beam \u223c (10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126 ) * 4\u03c0. Besides, the observations of K\u03b1 lines of iron\nin the X-ray afterglow spectra of GRBs (970508, 970828, 991216, 000214) and the observation of\nredshifted absorption feature of neutral iron (7.1 keV) simultaneously with GRB 990705 are also\nevidence in favor of massive stars \u2013 progenitors of GRBs.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe nature of \u03b3-ray bursts is still a debated issue,\nbut the consensus is growing on the association of\nGRBs with massive stars progenitors. The long duraion GRBs are probably connected with the death of\nmassive stars and hence with a supernova-like explosion (Paczin\u015bki, 1999; MacFadyen & Woosley, 1999,\nand references therein). Over the past three years\nthis \"hypernova\" or \"collapsar\" model has gained\nstrength, especially because long duration GRBs have\nbeen found to occur in star-forming regions of their\ngalaxies - the only places where very massive stars\nlive and die (Fruchter et al., 1999; Hogg & Fruchter,\n1999; Bloom et al., 2000; Sokolov et al., 2001). The\nleading scenario now for long duration GRBs is a\nsudden collapse of a massive rapidly rotating star.\nMay be merging neutron stars still remain a possibility for the short GRBs, but this model (Lattimer\n& Schramm, 1976) has lost favor as an explanation\nfor long duration GRBs, those lasting more than 1\nsecond.\nThis paper shows possible consequences for the\nscenario explaining GRBs if massive stars are GRB\nprogenitors actually. In particular, as a result of evolution the massive stars at a Wolf-Rayet phase (which\nis characterized by a strong stellar wind) can produce\nrather dense envelopes around them \u2013 an effect of\n\nthe WR stellar wind interacting with the interstellar\nmedium (Ramirez-Ruiz et al., 2001).\nFirst we consider some features of BV RI light\ncurves of such a well-studied object as the OT of\nGRB 970508 (Sokolov et al., 1998; Galama et al.,\n1998; Sokolov et al., 1999). We begin the analysis of\nthese features of the BV RI light curves when the\nGRB host galaxy is observed. There is independent\nevidence in favor of the massive GRB progenitors: at\nleast in some GRBs a SN may be the origin of a red\ncomponent (or a shoulder) in the BV RI light curves\nof a GRB afterglow, detected several weeks after a\nGRB. A possible contribution of a SN in the BV RI\nlight curves of GRB 970508 is considered. Then, on\nthe basis of the light curve of the OT of GRB 970508\nand other GRB transients with due regard for the observable magnitudes of GRB host galaxies, the possibility of the strong GRB beaming will be grounded.\nThe presence of a considerable component of the\nX-ray emission in the radiation of BeppoSAX's GRBs\nwhich is observed simultaneously with the long duration GRBs (or a prompt GRB X-ray emission) is\nvery essential. The Italian-Dutch X-ray mission BeppoSAX can provide not only arc minute localization\nof GRBs, but also measurements of their spectra in a\nbroad (2 to 700 keV) energy band (Piro et al., 1998;\nFrontera et al., 2000). The iron line features (also de-\n\n\f2\n\n18.5\nB\nV\nRc\nIc\n\n19.5\n20.5\n\nMagnitude\n\ntected in the X-ray afterglow with the ASCA and\nChandra satellites) would strongly suggest a massive\nstellar GRB progenitor too, since these features can\nbe direct evidence for the existence of these dense envelopes in the vicinity of a pre-GRB object. The account for a huge force of pressure on the environment\naround a GRB-progenitor produced by a huge and\nhighly collimated flux of the prompt \u03b3-ray and X-ray\nradiation can considerably change our understanding\nof a GRB afterglow.\n\na)\n\n21.5\n22.5\n23.5\n24.5\n25.5\n\nI\n\n2. The light curves: multiband photometry of the GRB970508 optical counterpart\n\nAt the first two stages - the increase of brigthness and the OT brighness maximum - the behav-\n\nII\n\n1\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\n10\n\n100\nDays\n\n21.5\nB\nV\nRc\nIc\n\n22.5\n\nMagnitude\n\nThe OT of GRB 970508 is a second optical source\nrelated to a \u03b3-ray burst registered by the BeppoSAX\nsatellite. The optical variable object was first reported\nby H. Bond as a possible optical counterpart of GRB\n970508 (Bond, 1997) and was independently found in\nour data (Rc band, 1-m telescope) only about 0.5 day\nlater. Observations of the GRB 970508 optical remnant were continued with the 6-m telescope in the\nstandard BV Rc Ic bands till Aug. 1998. In Fig. 1 a,b\nthe behavior of the OT light curves + host galaxy of\nGRB 970508 up to 470th day is shown; a) for the logarithmic time and b) for the linear time for days after\nthe GRB. The BV Rc Ic magnitudes with their errors\n(joined by the broken heavy lines) are pictured. Four\nindependent power-laws (the smooth thin lines) determined by fitting the observed BV Rc Ic light curves\nwith a two-component model, the sum of the OT\nGRB 970508, fading according to a power-law (but\nafter the brightness maximum in Fig. 1 a), and a\nconstant brightness host galaxy (F = Fo \u00d7 t\u03b1 + Fc\nwith different \u03b1) are shown (for details see Sokolov et\nal., 1999).\nThe data obtained with the SAO RAS 1-m and\n6-m telescopes allow us to divide the GRB OT\nbrigthness changes at least into 4 stages (Fig. 1 a,b):\nI ) the increase of brigthness on a time scale of about\none day;\nII ) (after the maximum) the exponential brightness\nfall from our observations during about 4 days with\na stable broad-band spectrum;\nIII ) further brightness fading according to a rough\npower-law; but note that from the 31-36th days after\nthe GRB the object did not show any smooth further\npower-law fall at least in the Ic filter.\nIV ) after approximately 200 days any power-law\ndecay ceased and the OT contribution to the host\ngalaxy flux was already less than the observational\nerrors.\n\n26.5\n\nb)\n\n23.5\n\n24.5\n\n25.5\n\nIV\n26.5\n0.0\n\n100.0\n\n200.0\n\n300.0\n\n400.0\n\n500.0\n\nDays\n\nFigure 1: The behavior of BV Rc Ic light curves of the\nOT + host galaxy of GRB 970508 up to about 470th\nday from the time of the GRB. Four independent\nBV Rc Ic power-law fits with different \u03b1 (see text) are\nexhibited by the thin lines. The BV Rc Ic light curves\nare shown on logarithmic (a) and linear (b) scales.\n\nior of the light-curves has not been understood yet\n(see Panaitescu & Kumar, 2001). Nevertheless, at the\nOT brighness maximum and immediately after it, all\nBV RI fluxes were measured with the smallest errors,\n0.03 \u2013 0.07 mag. And any power law does not best fit\nfor the brightness fading after the maximum (May\n10.77 UT). We see the same exponential law in all\nBV RI bands (Sokolov et al., 1998), or an identical\nexponential brightness fading was observed in 4 bands\nsimultaneously.\nAfter the 5th day the light curves in the BV Rc Ic\nbands can be described by power laws (with different\n\u03b1). But starting with about the 31st day after the\nGRB, the OT did not show further fall of brightness\nin the Ic filter. This phenomenon lasted not less than\n51 days. In that period the OT was stable around Ic\n= 23. After 87 days the deviation from the \"average\"\n\n\f3\n\npower law was already as high as \u2243 1 mag. (Ic was\n23.04\u00b10.14 for the 87.085th day after the GRB). The\nbehavior we observed can also be explained by some\nintrinsic features of GRB 970508 OT. In this temporal\nand spectral behavior of the GRB OT there can be a\nhint of a similar behavior of supernovae (see below).\nLate-time observations of the GRB 970508 optical counterpart in July-August 1998 show that the\noptical counterpart did not change during the last\nhalf-year, and we can conclude that we observe a\npure GRB host galaxy with B = 25.77 \u00b1 0.19,\nV = 25.25\u00b10.22, Rc = 24.99\u00b10.17, Ic = 24.07\u00b10.25,\nalready without the GRB optical remnant contribution. Comparison of the BV RI spectral energy distribution of the GRB host with local starburst galaxies\nleads to the best fits for Scd starburst H II galaxies\n(Sokolov et al., 1999; 2001).\nThe global best \u03c72 -fits (see Fig. 1) with a single\npower law, for most of the filters used, are not acceptable (Sokolov et al. 1998). Some intrinsic variability\nof the GRB optical remnant fading is possible, which\ndemands a more complex law presenting the largest\nmultiband homogeneous data set from one telescope.\n\n3. Supernovae and Gamma-ray beaming\nThe Ic band light curve of GRB 970508 afterglow\nexhibits a rebrightening phase, or a \"shoulder\" (Fig.\n1 a,b). This spectral property lasts for not less than 51\ndays. Over across this period the color index (V \u2212 I)\nincreases up to \u22481.6 mag (Ic = 23.04 \u00b1 0.14 for the\nOT). The deviation from the \"average\" power law\nwith < \u03b1 >= \u22121.25 exceeds 1 magnitude. Recent\ninvestigations show that GRB optical afterglows have\nunusual temporal and V RI spectral properties: GRB\n970228 (Galama et al., 2000), GRB 980326 (Bloom\net al., 1999) , GRB 990712 (Bjornsson et al., 2001),\nand GRB 991208 (Castro-Tirado et al., 2001). All\nthese OTs have temporal and spectral characteristics\nsimilar to those of GRB 970508, for which the Ic band\nlight curve is consistent with the assumption that the\nSN emission overtakes the OT flux at late times, i.e.\nnearly 31 days after the GRB. It should be noted that\nthe emission of all Type I SNe shows a strong UV\ndeficit owing to absorption lines below 3900\u00c5. Thus,\nfor the redshift z = 0.835 a weak flux is expected\nfrom the suggested SN in the Rc band corresponding\nto the Urest (3652\u00c5) in the rest frame.\nIn contrast, the SN brightness must be in the maximum at larger wavelengths (Fig.1), i.e. in the Ic band\nas observed for GRB 970508 (and for GRB 970228\nwith z = 0.695 (Galama et al., 2000) plus time profile stretching for the light curve of the SN by a factor\nof (1 + z). One can see the effect from an \"average\"\npower-law fit F = Fo \u00d7 t\u03b1 + Fc with < \u03b1 >= \u22121.25.\n\nThe deviations (\u03c72 /d.o.f) from the \"average\" powerlaw increase toward the red part of the OT BV Rc Ic\nspectrum: \u03c72 /d.o.f = 1.57 for the B-band, 2.41 for\nthe V -band, 2.93 for the Rc -band, and 3.62 for the\nIc -band (see Sokolov et al., 1999 for details).\nAs z = 0.835, the Ic band in the observer frame\ncorresponds to the Brest (4448\u00c5) band in the rest\nframe, the observed Ic flux is thus used to derive the\npeak absolute magnitude (MB ) of the assumed SN.\nAt the Ic \"shoulder\" (Fig. 2) the brightness of GRB\n970508 OT corresponds to the maximum luminosity\nof a peculiar SN with MB around -19.5 if for GRB\n990708 host we have MBrest around -18.5 (Sokolov et\nal., 1999). We can consider type-Ib/c SNe as a preliminary model of GRB/SN \u03b3-ray bursters, but the\npeak magnitudes of type-Ib/c (or core collapse) SNe\nare not constant: MB is from -16 to -19.5. Thus, the\nGRB host galaxies (for ground-based observations, at\nleast) must be dimmer than the peak magnitude of\nthe SN (see Table 1 in Sokolov et al., 2001).\nSN 1997ef has been recognized as a peculiar SN Ic\nfrom its light curve (Iwamoto et al., 2000). It shows a\nvery broad/flat peak and a slow tail. (But the luminosity is lower than that of the well-known SN\n1998bw.) However, for the purposes of this paper, the\nshape of SN Ic light curve is sufficient as an example\nof type-Ib/c SN. We do not know exactly the light\ncurve (and the spectrum) of the true SN accompanying GRBs; may be in the OT GRB 970508 case it was\na peculiar SN by its luminosity and by the shape of\nthe light curve (Fig. 2).\nSo, we can expect GRBs to originate from massive\nstars which have lost their hydrogen envelope before\na SN-like explosion. If GRBs arise from collapses of\nmassive stars in starforming galaxies, it is an unavoidable consequence that emission from an underlying\nSN should be superimposed on the GRB afterglow.\nEconomy of hypotheses leads us to suppose that all\nor at least the main part of long duration GRBs are\nassociated with SNe (but not all SNe are associated with GRBs).\nFrom the observations of 1997-2000 for known\nGRB host galaxies we have (see Fig. 3 ):\nmHostGal = from \u223c 22 to \u223c 28 st.mag.\nSuch faint (or fainter) galaxies are indeed expected\nfrom studies of the properties of the GRB host galaxies. It leads to the fact that the search for direct GRBSN associations in galaxies close to us is a challenge,\nbecause the majority of the SNe related to GRBs will\nbe faint (22-26 mag) and also in very distant galaxies\nwith z \u2265 0.4 \u2212 4.5.\nHaving established that the GRB hosts are faint,\nfor a number of galaxies brighter than 26 mag in one\nsquare degree of the sky we have Ngal<26mag \u2248 2 *\n105 * gal * deg \u22122 (Casertano et al., 2000).

It should be kept in\nmind that GRBs are not observed in all galaxies and\nthat not all types of SNe can be related to GRBs,\nbut only type-Ib/c (Capellaro et al., 1999). So we\nhave NSN \u2248 0.001 *yr\u22121 galaxy \u22121 . But if one looks at\nthe matter the other way round, we must remember:\nthe massive star-forming in very distant (and dusty)\nGRB galaxies with z \u223c> 1 is more vigorous than\nin the local starburst galaxies or in galaxies like the\nMilky Way (Blain and Natarajan, 2000), giving rise\nSN bursts of 10 times and more.\nThus, with due regard for these reservations, an\nestimate for the number of GRBs which could be related to SNe is of order of\nNGRB /NSN \u2248 5 * (10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126 ).\nSo, if some GRB \u2013 SN relation really exists, then we\nhave two possibilities:\n1) either we deal with a very very rare type of\nSNe (or \"hypernova\"?) \u2013 GRBs related only to the\n10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126 -th part of all observed SNe in distant\ngalaxies (up to 28th mag), or\n2) we have a very strong \u03b3-ray beaming with a\nsolid angle up to\n\u03a9beam \u223c (10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126 ) * 4\u03c0,\nif GRBs are associated with an asymmetric SN explosion, whereas the \u03b3-ray beam (and narrow collimated jet) is directed towards the observer on the\n\n\f5\n\nEarth. And if GRBs are so highly collimated, radiating only into a small fraction of the sky, the enegry of\neach event may be much reduced, by several (\u223c 5 \u2212 6)\norders of magnitude:\nEbeam = E\u03b3 \u03a9beam /4\u03c0 \u223c 1045 \u2212 1047 ergs\nfor the isotropic equivalent of the total GRB energy\nE\u03b3 \u223c 1051 \u2212 1052 ergs.\nThus, if all or the main part of long GRBs are associated with SNe, we need more examples to test the\nGRB-SN link. But from the Earth we can see only peculiar SNe (by their luminosities and by light curves)\nconnected with GRBs. The SNe must be brighter\nthan their hosts. The luminosity of these dusty galaxies MB is basically between -18.6 and -21.3 (Sokolov\net al., 2001).\n\n4. Discussion: still, what are the progenitors of Gamma-Ray Bursts?\n4.1. X-ray spectra and close environment of\nGRB source\nThe BeppoSAX, ASCA and Chandra observations in\nX-rays confirm rather a link with the death of massive\nstars; the satellites found a spectral signature of iron\nfrom different GRBs. To date, four GRBs have shown\nevidence for an iron emission line during the X-ray\nafterglow, observed 8-40 hours after the burst event\n(GRB 970508, Piro et al., 1999; GRB 970828, Yoshida\net al., 2001; GRB 991216, Piro et al., 2000; GRB\n000214, Antonelli et al., 2000). SNe or SN-progenitors\ncan be the most plausible source of such an iron. In\nany case, the new data are very important, because all\nspectral emission lines observed so far are produced\nby the GRB host galaxies rather than at the burst\nsite.\nChandra's observation of the brightest GRB\n991216 was started 37 hours after the BATSE/GRBM\ntrigger (Piro et al., 2000). The spectrum of the Xray afterglow shows the emission line at energy E =\n3.49 \u00b1 0.06 keV. The emission feature is associated\nwith the rest energy of 6.97 keV of the emission of Hlike ions of iron (FeXXVI) because at higher energies\nthe Chandra/ACIS-S spectrum shows evidence of a\nrecombination edge in the emission at E = 4.4 \u00b1 0.5\nkeV. The identification of this feature with the iron\nrecombination edge (with the rest energy of 9.28\nkeV) gives z = 1.11 \u00b1 0.11 consistent with z = 1.02\nfound in optical spectroscopy of the OT GRB 991216\n(Vreeswijk et al., 2000).\nAn iron recombination edge at 9.28 keV is, indeed, expected when the iron emission is driven by\nphotoionization and the medium is heavily ionized\nby the radiation produced by X-rays from the GRB\nor its afterglow. If the medium lies in the line of\n\nsight, the edge is expected to be seen in absorption at early times, before the photoionization of the\nmedium. (Evidence of such a feature has been found\nin another GRB, GRB 990705.) At later times, when\nthe medium becomes heavily ionized and recombination takes place, the edge is seen in emission. In\nthis condition X-ray lines are produced almost exclusively through recombination of electrons on H-like\niron. From the Chandra observation of GRB 991216,\nthe distance of the medium from the GRB source or\nthe size of the region of the emission feature formation around the GRB site is R > 2*1015 cm (R = c*t).\nThe latter condition is derived from the presence of\nthe line 1.5 days (> 37 hours) after the GRB, which is\nshorter than the observed one by a factor of (1+z)\u22121 .\nDifferent scenarios have been proposed to explain\nthe lines in emission (see Lazzatti et al., 2001; Vietri\net al., 2001; Rees and Meszaros, 2000; Weth et al.,\n2000). The observations by BeppoSAX, ASCA and\nChandra seem to indicate large amount of iron close\nto the GRB site. One of the explanations emerging\n(Vietri et al., 2001) from all pieces of evidence is as\nfollows: a massive progenitor - like a \"hypernova\"\n(Paczynski, 1998) or a \"collapsar\" (Woosley, 1993)\n- ejects, shortrly (several months) before the GRB,\na substantial fraction of its mass. But there is room\nfor a lot of models so far and (for all that) other more\nsimple scenarios invoking a simultaneous explosion of\na GRB source and a progenitor star are possible -\nsee below.\nUnlike of GRB 991216 and others which showed\nevidence for the iron emission lines during the X-ray\nafterglow, GRB 990705 showed a prominent absorption feature at 3.8 keV and an equivalent hydrogen\ncolumn density that disappeared 13 s after the burst\nonset (Amati et al., 2000). The absorption feature was\ninterpreted as due to an edge produced by the neutral\niron (i.e. at 7.1 keV), redshifted to 3.8 keV (corresponding to z = 0.86). And what is the most important: the absorption feature seen during the first 13\nseconds from the BeppoSAX/GRBM trigger, became\nundetectable afterwords. The straightforward (or a\n\"simplest\") interpretation of the absorption feature\nreported by Amati et al. (2000) is that neutral iron is\npresent along the line of sight to the burst. This iron is\nphotoionized by the prompt GRB X-ray photons untill all electrons are stripped from the iron ions, causing the disappearance of the edge. But in this case the\nsize of the region of the absorption feature formation\naround the GRB site is (l = c*t) l \u2248 4*1011 cm \u2248 6R\u2299 .\nIt is quite immediate environment of the GRB site!\nEmission and absorption features in the X-ray\nspectra of GRBs and their afterglows provide a fundamental new tool to study their close environment (or\nthe circumburst) and thus their possible progenitors.\nTheoretical computations (Ramirez-Ruiz et al., 2001)\nshow that only a dense, massive medium close to the\n\n\f6\n\nGRB site - such as that expected in the case of a\nmassive progenitor - could produce an iron emission\nline detectable with the current X-ray instrumentation. Ramirez-Ruiz et al. (2001) argued that highdensity shells could be produced from a low-density\nand low-velocity wind if the massive progenitor or\na massive star undergoes a Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase,\nwhich is characterized by a strong stellar wind that\ncauses the star to lose enough of its outer layers for\nthe surface hydrogen abundance to become minimal.\nThe radius of a WR star is sufficiently small before\nthe internal engine ceases to operate. Because of the\nintrinsic variation of mass-loss rates in WR evolution,\nwe have shells of varying gas density. The effects of the\nWR ejecta interacting with the interstellar medium\n(ISM) can be observed in the wind bubbles around\nsome of these objects. The deceleration of a pre-SN\nwind by the pressure of the surrounding medium or\nthe interaction of fast and slow winds could also create circumstellar shells. Moreover, massive stars tend\nto lie in associations, so there is the combined effect\nof the winds of many stars. Thus, the state of the ambient medium of a WR star at the end of its life\nis determined primarily by the time evolution (until core collapse) of the mass-loss rate. Here, by the\npaper of Ramirez-Ruiz et al. (2001), we emphasize\nsome interesting contributions to the structure of the\nambient medium that arise when the ejected winds\ninteract with the ISM during the WR lifetime (about\n105 yr).\nFrom the inside (near WR site) and to the outside: the external medium particle density of the wind\nejected by the progenitor is best modeled by a powerlaw n = Ar\u22122 . A spherical shell with large column\ndensity arises when the ejected material accumulates\nat the radius rdec at which the free expansion phase of\nthe ejected wind terminates. So, we have set the density of the ambient material n0 before the WR phase\nto be 1 cm\u22123 . But if a neighbouring star is present,\nthe density (n0 ) of the surrounding medium can be as\nlarge as 106 cm\u22123 , causing the ejected wind to slow\nrapidly at a much smaller radius, rdec . Figs 2b and\n4b from the paper of Ramirez-Ruiz et al. (2001) show\nthe effect of different initial masses on the structure\nof the ambient medium. The density can be fited by\nthe power law n(r) = Ar\u22122 for r < rdec . The value of\nthe constant A = 3.0 * 1035 A\u2217 as a function of M0 is\nshown in panels a. The Figs. 2 and 4 show (panels b)\nalso the radial location (rdec ) of the highest density\nshell as a function of initial main-sequence mass M0\nfor different values of n0 and for different metallicity\n(Fig. 4 in the Ramirez-Ruiz's et al. paper). The free\nexpansion of the ejected wind is terminated when the\nswept-up mass becomes comparable to the mass of\nthe wind. The ejected mass then accumulates at the\nradius rdec . This overdense region lies closer to the\nprogenitor for higher density n0 of the surrounding\n\nmedium (or the density of ambient material before\nthe WR phase) and for WR stars originating from\nlow initial mass stars M0 . Panels c in Figs. 2 and 4\n(Ramirez-Ruiz et al., 2001): all the evolved WR stars\nhave lost their hydrogen envelope (Bisnovatyi-Kogan\nand Nadyozhin, 1972) and are left with a bare helium\ncore prior to core collapse (or prior to GRB?).\nAn important result of these calculations for us is\nthe fact that for the initial star masses of M0 \u2248 30M\u2299\nthe region, in which almost all mass (\u223c 10 \u2212 20M\u2299 )\nreleased during the WR phase is concentrated, can\nreally be of a typical dimension of \u223c 1015 cm, which\nis also the result of BeppoSAX, ASCA, and Chandra's X-ray observations of the GRBs (GRB 970508,\nGRB 970828, GRB 991216, GRB 000214). If there\nexists the overdense region (\"bump\") or not depends\non the density of the ambient material n0 before the\nWR phase. (Note \u2013 it can be important for the OT\nGRB 970508, \u2013 many WR stars appear to be single;\nhowever, the fraction of visible close WR + OB binaries seems to be around 35 per cent.) The internal (or\nthe inside) medium particle density near the GRB\nprogenitor follows the power-law n = Ar\u22122 where\nA = A\u2217 * 3 * 1035 cm\u22121 and 0.1 < A\u2217 < 10 for WR\nstars at the end of their lives. Besides, there can exist\na region of dimension of 2rdec \u223c 1015 cm or a more\nor less sharp boundary in which the released mass\nstopped by the interaction between the WR winds\nand the ISM. Apparently, such a boundary around\nthe WR star or the GRB progenitors should arise in\ntypical star-forming regions with densities of at least\nand perhaps significantly exceeding 10 - 100 cm\u22123 ,\nwhich is characteristic of large molecular clouds complexes if GRBs are associated with massive stars indeed.\n4.2. Optical and X-ray light curves of the OT\nof GRB 970508\nPanaitescu, & Kumar (2001) analyzed the afterglows\nof four well-studied GRBs (GRB 980703, GRB\n990123, GRB 990510, GRB 991216), assuming that\nthe emission is due to the interaction of a collimated\nrelativistic shock with the ambient medium. They\nhave shown from their particular afterglow shock\nmodel that the ambient density of some GRBs can be\nas low as \u223c 10\u22121 \u2212 10\u22124 cm\u22123 by contrast with densities, 10 - 100 cm\u22123 (and perhaps even more), that\nshould be typical for the star-forming regions. But we\nhave to note that the ascribed paradoxical densities\nare very model dependent. We have now the straightforward data from X-ray spectra: e.g. GRB 991216\njust from their GRB list. (The search for spectral\nfeatures of one of the primary objectives of Chandra\nand BeppoSAX's GRB observation programs.) In addition, it should be remarked that Panaitescu & Kumar (2001) in the analysis of multi-wavelength data\n\n\f7\n\nof four GRBs leave out the best-studied OT of GRB\n970508, whose optical light-curve cannot be entirely\nexplained within the framework of their GRB afterglow shock model, as the OT exibited a re-brightening\nafter 1 day, indicating a possible delayed energy injection or a strong fluctuation of the external density\nor the fluctuation of just the same ambient density\n(or n0 ?).\nPiro et al. (1999) have searched the X-ray spectrum of GRB 970508's afterglow for an Fe line observed by BeppoSAX. They found such a line but\nwith a limited statistical significance (99.3 %) in the\nearly part (first 16 h) of the afterglow. The line decreases in the later part of the observations (\u223c 1\nday after the GRB) by at least a factor 2, enough\nto make it undetectable with current apparaturs. Simultaneously with the line disappearance, the X-ray\nflux both rises (see Fig. 5 (b)) and hardens consistent with the appearance of a new shock (?). Then,\nat the end of the outburst, the spectrum steepens.\nIt is most likely that the line of GRB 970508 is produced by fluorescence and recombination of Fe atoms\nionized by the intense X-ray flux of the GRB. Judging by the X-ray and \u03b3-ray peak fluxes (Frontera et\nal., 2000) the prompt X-ray radiation simultaneously\ndetected with the BeppoSAX/GRBM (40-700 keV)\nand the BeppoSAX/WFC (1.5-26 keV) can produce\nup to 10% of the total energy of GRBs. So, at the\nearly phases of the GRB the radiation field is so high\n(FX \u223c 1017 \u2212 1018 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for r = 3 * 1015 cm)\nthat iron atoms are completely (or nearly) stripped\nof their electrons. From the line variability for GRB\n970508 one can deduce that this ambient medium\nshould be located at the distance of c * t \u2248 3 * 1015 cm\nfrom the GRB source.\nThat is all at the moment what can be said about\nthe interpretation of the X-ray observations, independetly of one or another model adhered by the authors\nthemselves (Piro et al., 1999; see also Vietri et al.,\n2001). In particular, the estimate of the mass of Fe\ncan be model-dependent. Note that the GRB beaming would introduce an additional geometrical factor.\nThis would reduce the complete number of the Xray's photons and hence reduce the mass of Fe required to produce the emissiom line. We can try to\naccount for this circumstance after comparison of Xray and optical data for OT GRB 970508. But we\ncan agree at once with the authors (Piro et al., 1999;\nVietri et al., 2001) in one thing, independently of the\nmodel in which the mass of Fe is calculated: in contrast to the fairly clean environment expected in the\nmerging of two neutron stars, the observed line properties would imply that the site of the GRB is embeded in a large mass of material, consistent with some\npre-GRB-explosion ejecta arising from a massive star.\nBesides, if the scenario \"a massive star ->\nWR -> pre-SN = pre-GRB\" with the forma-\n\ntion of a shell around WR is true, then it could\nbe supposed that the reason of the arising of relativistic jet is the powerful light pressure of the\nprompt X-ray radiation of a GRB source. For the\nforce of the light pressure acting on the environment around the GRB source (WR-star ?) we have\nLGRB /(4\u03c0r2 ) * (\u03c3T /c), where LGRB is an isotropic\nequivalent (\u223c 1050\u221251 erg*s\u22121 ) of GRB luminosity,\nr is the distance from the center (near the GRB site),\n\u03c3T = 0.66*10\u221224cm2 is the Thompson cross section, c\n\u2013 velocity of light. Even withouth detailed calculation\nit is clear that such a force can exceed the Eddington\nlimit (\u223c 1038 erg*s\u22121 for 1 M\u2299 ) by 12-13 orders. If we\nassume the GRB radiation (the prompt X-rays + \u03b3rays) to be collimated or we have very strong beaming\nwith the solid angle \u03a9beam \u223c (10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126 ) * 4\u03c0, then\nthe formation of an ultra-relativistic jet becomes inevitable. Now everything depends on the ionization,\ndensity, and temperature of matter in the immediate\nvicinity of the GRB source - an asymmetric collapsing nucleus of a massive star. But then the behavior\nof X-ray and optical lightcurves for the afterglow of\nGRB 970508 (see Figs. 4 and 5), inexplicable within\nthe framework of Panaitescu and Kumar's (2001) afterglow model, becomes quite natural.\nFrom Fig. 4 we see some deviations from an average (or from a \"standard\") power law in all 4 bands.\nThe broad-band optical spectrum of the OT did not\nchange at all in that period of the exponential brightness fall. The exponential B, V , R, I behavior of the\nOT immediately after the maximum (Fig. 5 a) correlates with GRB 970508 X-ray transient light curve\n(Fig. 5 b) after the obvious minimum (Piro et al.,\n1998), and the subsequent X-ray flux fading deviates\nfrom the power law. The same as the OT decay does\nnot follow any power-law (Fig. 4). This is in favor of a\ncommon origin of the X-ray and optical events. More\nthan 16%: 6% (in optical) + 10% (or \u223c 1050 ergs in\nX-rays only) of energy of the GRB itself was released\nin that period. There was some activity which had\nrather high energy, comparable to that of the GRB\nburst. And it was on a time scale (\u223c 105 s) 10.000\ntimes longer than the duration of the GRB itself.\nThis enigmatic re-brightening of the GRB 970508\nafterglow could be a consequence of collision of the jet\nshock fronts with the high density spherical shell or a\nsharp boundary (or the overdense region) with dimension of 2rdec \u223c 1015 cm in which the released mass\nstopped during the WR phase of the GRB progenitor.\nThat dense outer shell with a dimension of \u223c 1015 cm\ncatches up the essential X-ray energy and we have a\nnew X-ray source of 0.8 day after the GRB (Fig. 5\nb). But we do not observe the jet itself. We see (especially in this maximum brightness of GRB 970508\nafterglow) the manifestation of both these shocks and\n(as their effect) a powerful X-ray source arising as the\njet moves through the density inhomogenity (\u223c 1010\n\n\f8\n1\n\ncm\u22123 ) around pre-SN (= WR). Apparently, this is\njust the exponential decay lag of this shell (a spherical layer of a thickness of \u223c 1015 cm too) against\nthe background of synchrotron radiation of the shock\nwave in it that we observe during several days after\nthe maximum (Fig. 4 and 5) for the GRB 970508 afterglow. After this a new X-ray source has flashed out\n(4-5 days after GRB), only synchrotron radiation of\nthe shock wave remains at passage of the jet through\nthe homogeneous ISM with a density of n0 , which existed around GRB progenitor or around the WR star.\nThese are approximately the same mechanisms of radiation that are used by Panaitescu & Kumar (2001).\nBut perhaps the strong deceleration due to the interaction of the relativistic shock with the ambient\nmedium does not arise as in their model because the\ncompact relativistic jet (or \"bullet\") is decelerating\nbut not the shock. This \"bullet\" moves at a relativistic speed and the shock (arising as it moves through\nISM) only heats this medium.\nIt is not always that such an overdensity can arise\naround the GRB progenitors unlike the case of GRB\n970508 progenitor. It depends on the value of n0 and\nother factors (see Ramirez-Ruiz et al., 2001). But apparently, a sphere of a size of \u223c 1015 cm around WR\nstars often forms with a more or less sharp jump in\ndensity at its boundary. In connection with that I\nmake bold to say here some \"seditious\" thought: the\nknown breaks or steepening of some GRB afterglow\nlight-curves (have been interpreted as a collimation\neffect in GRB-models with fireball) can be explained\nin this scenario (with the acceleration of the relativistic jet by X-rays + \u03b3-rays) by the same interaction\nbetween this jet (or \"bullet\") and the inhomogeneous\nmedium around WR. As the jet goes out of this sphere\nthe medium density around the GRB source changes\nand the sphere flashes on. The breaks will appear at\nlight curves that are related only to inhomogeneities\nof n(r) near the GRB progenitor. (As to the breaks\nin the light curves see also Pian et al. (2000), Dai and\nCheng (2001), and references therein.)\nAnd where does the acceleration of the jet up to a\nrelativistic velocity occur? Now we will try to answer\nthis question. The photon flux producing the radiation pressure accelerating the matter at a distance of r\nfrom the center (near the GRB site) is LGRB /(4\u03c0r2 ).\nIt is inside this region and in the immediate vicinity\nof a GRB source the photon flux turns out to be huge\nand at least not less than Eddington's flux. (From definition: if LEdd is the Eddington limit \u223c 1038 erg*s\u22121\nfor 1 M\u2299 , and R\u2217 is the size of a compact object\nof \u223c 106 cm then LEdd/(4\u03c0R\u22172 ) is a flux stopping\nthe accretion onto a compact source - the falling of\nmatter on the source at a parabolic velocity.) From\nthe condition that the photon flux LGRB /(4\u03c0r2 ) at a\ndistance of r is equal to the LEdd/(4\u03c0R\u22172 ) and taking\ninto account that the luminosity of the GRB radia-\n\nThe OT brighness maximum and immediately after, when all\n\nFigure\nThe light\nof GRB\nuxes were4:measured\nwithcurves\nthe smallest\nerrors!970508 optical\n.\ncounterpart\nduring\n5\ndays\nafter\nthe\nburst.

So, it can be near the region of a size\nof \u2248 6R\u2299 , which follows from the observation of the\nvariable absorption feature in the prompt X-ray emission of GRB 990705 (Amati et al., 2000).\n\n5. Summary\nThere is circumstantial evidence that GRBs are associated with the collaps of massive stars. The observations in optical (GRB host galaxies, OT light curves)\nand GRB X-rays (light curves and spectra) suggest\nthat this is so. Nevertheless, does every long GRB\nbegin with the core-collapse supernova explosion? It\nis still early to draw firm conslusions - new observations are needed - but in any case a link between\nGRBs and SNe seems to be convincingly confirmed.\nWeak emission line features 8-40 hours after the GRB\nmay also result from the supernova GRB scenario. In\nall these cases significant X-ray absorption features,\nin particular during the prompt GRB phase, are expected. No significant X-ray spectral features should\nresult from compact-object binary mergers.\nHere an attempt is undertaken to understand the\nlight curves (in X-ray and in optical) of the OT of\nGRB 970508 which have never been explained properly so far. The X-ray spectra and the light curves\n(like OT GRB 970508) some of GRB afterglows point\nto the existence of the dense medium surround-\n\n\f9\n1\n\nsupported by the \"Astronomy\" Foundation (grant\n97/1.2.6.4) and RFBR N01-02-17106a\n\n19.0\nB\nV\nRc\nIc\n\n(a)\n20.0\n\nReferences\n\nMagnitude\n\n21.0\n22.0\n23.0\n24.0\n25.0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\nDay\n\n(b)\n\nSo, we see the same deviations from the \"average\" power law in all 4 bands.\nFigure\n5: GRB 970508 light curves: (a) BV Rc Ic\nAnd the exponential B,V,R,I OT behaviors immediately after the maximum\nSAO\ndata;\n(b) 2\u201310\nBeppoSAX\nXorrelateRAS\nwith the\nGRB970508\nX-raykeV\ntransient\nlight urve MECS\nafter the obvious\nminimum.\nThe\nsubsequent\nX-ray\nux fading\ndeviates\nfrom\nthewith\npowerthe\nlaw as\nray\ndata\n(Piro\net\nal.,\n1998),\nthe\npower\nlaw\nwell as the OT de ay does not follow the power-law.\n\nslope of \u22121.1 \u00b1 0.1 is shown (dashed line).\n\ning GRB sources , which, combined with the data\non GRB host galaxies and the manifestations of SNs\non the light curves, agrees well with the scenarios\nwhere the GRB progenitor (or pre-SN) is a WR star.\nIf a GRB progenitor always coincides with a preSN progenitor (or GRB progenitors are actually WR\nstars), then the GRB radiation is always very collimated. Then the formation of relativistic jets becomes an inevitable consequence of huge radiational\npressure owing to the huge flux during the GRB. We\nhave not known so far how to produce such a narrow\nbunch of hard X-rays and \u03b3-rays or what the mechanism of GRBs is. (The same as fireball GRB model\nmakers do not know how to produce it - the fireball.)\nBut in that scenario, with the straightforward link\nof the GRBs and core-collapse SNe and (as a result)\nwith the strong \u03b3-ray beaming, the energetics of the\nGRB sources is substantially lower and the energy release is not higher than the bolometric luminosity of\nSNe. So, we can reduce the GRB problem to the old\none - the problem of the SNe explosion mechanism.\nBut this is a relief too - the number of hypotheses\non the GRB sources does not increase at least.\nAcknowledgements.
