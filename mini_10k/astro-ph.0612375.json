In this work, we discuss the\ninterpretation of these features.\nPhase-I: The rapid decline of the very early X-ray lightcurve. A steep initial\nX-ray decay F\u03bd \u221d t\u2212\u03b1 (\u03b1 \u223c 3 \u2212 5) has been seen in a good fraction of Swift GRBs [3],\nfor which the most widely considered explanation is the off-axis emission from regions\nat \u03b8 > \u0393\u22121 (the curvature effect, or high latitude emission) [4]. In the uniform ejecta\nmodel, provided that the sub-outflow powering a prompt \u03b3\u2212ray pulse is ejected at a time\nt0 , even after the gamma-rays along the sightline have ceased (i.e., t > t0 + \u03b4t, where \u03b4t\nis the duration of the pulse), still there is the off-axis emission observed from \u03b8 > \u0393\u22121\nwhich follows F\u03bdx \u221d [(t \u2212 t0 )/\u03b4t]\u22122\u2212\u03b2 , where \u03b2 \u223c 1 is the X-ray spectral index of the\nemission. Since the central engine turns off at tturn , what we P\nobserved is the high latitude\nemission of the earlier pulses. The flux declines as FX = F\u03bdx ,i [(t \u2212 t0,i )/\u03b4ti ]\u2212(2+\u03b2i ) ,\ni\n\nwhere i represents the i\u2212th pulse. Such a decline is much steeper than (t/tturn )\u2212(2+\u03b2)\nas long as tturn \u226b max{\u03b4ti }. What we faced is thus not why phase-I is so steep but why\nit is not significantly steeper unless max{\u03b4ti } \u223c tturn , as shown in Figure 2 of [5].\nHere we mention two alternatives naturally giving rise to sharp but not too sharp\nX-ray decline (i.e., FX \u221d t\u22123 or so). One is the \"dying central engine\" model, in which\nthe central engine does not turn off abruptly. The more and more dimmer X-ray emission generated in the more and more weaker energy dissipation may dominate over the\ncurvature effect of the early pulses, resulting in a shallower decay [5]. The other is the\n\"hot cocoon model\". In this model the sharp decline is explained as due to emission from\nthe hot plasma \"cocoon\" associated with the GRB ejecta, which expands relativistically\nafter the ejecta has broken through the stellar envelope, if a substantial fraction of the\ncocoon kinetic energy is dissipated at scattering optical depths \u223c 102 \u2212 103 [6].\nPhase-V: The energetic X-ray flares. So far, energetic X-ray flares have been\ndetected in several pre-Swift GRBs and about half Swift GRBs [7]. The most widely\nconsidered interpretation is the so-called \"late internal shock\" model, suggested by Fan\n& Wei [5] and Zhang et al. [1]. This model is in light of the following facts: the very steep\ndecline of the X-ray flares could be interpreted naturally; the multi flares detected in one\nburst, as in GRB 050730, could be accounted if the central engine restarts repeatedly; the\nsimultaneous optical emission is very weak [7] and may be suppressed by the synchrotron\nself-absorption, requiring an energy dissipation radius < 1015 cm. Considering that the\nmagnetic mechanism may be more efficient than the neutrino mechanism to extract the\nenergy needed to power the X-ray flare, Fan et al. [8] suggested that the outflow might\nbe highly magnetized and the flares were linearly polarized. In both the \"late internal\nshock\" model and the \"late internal magnetic dissipation\" model, the central engine has\nto be able to restart repeatedly. One natural speculation is that such re-activities are\ncaused by the intermittent fall-back accretion (see [9] for a recent review) (\u2217 ).\n(\u2217 ) We propose a strange star (SS)-white dwarf (WD) merger model for short GRBs with Xray flare (Detailed treatment will be presented elsewhere). We do not discuss a neutron star\n(NS)-WD merger because the hard surface of NS acts as a plug, stopping up the accretion. The\nSS-WD coalescence is quite similar to a solar mass black hole (BH) merging with a WD [10].\nThe short hard \u03b3\u2212ray spike(s) is produced when and only when the SS collapses to BH. The\naccretion of WD material onto the nascent BH lasts a few hundred seconds with an accretion\n\n\f3\n\nTHE INTERPRETATION OF THE SWIFT GRB X-RAY AFTERGLOWS\n\nHere we discuss the \"internal refreshed shock\" model. It is speculated that in some\nbursts, a significant part of the GRB ejecta energy is carried by the material moving\nwith a Lorentz factor \u0393s \u223c 10 [11]. Provided that at a time \u03b4T \u223c 100s after the burst,\nthe central engine re-starts and launches ultra-relativistic outflow. The newly launched\nejecta (moving with a Lorentz factor \u0393inj \u223c a few hundred) would catch up with the\nslow material at a radius Rc \u223c 2\u03932s c\u03b4T and generate forward/reverse shock emission.\nFor simplicity, we don't discuss the detailed process but to assume that surface A (the\nshocked slow material and the shocked new ejecta) has a Lorentz factor \u0393acc . When the\ncentral engine re-activity turns off, surface A is at a radius Rs \u223c Rc + 2\u03932acc cTreac , where\nTreac is the reactivity timescale of the central engine. The duration of emission of surface\ns\n)2 \u03b4T + Treac .\nA (essentially a single pulse) can be estimated as TA \u223c Rs /(2\u03932acc c) = ( \u0393\u0393acc\nThe observer's timescale t is \"calibrated\" to the trigger of the GRB. The forward\nshock emission of the GRB ejecta at Rc and \u03b8 = 0 will be observed at \u223c Rc /(2\u03932 c). The\nemission from surface A at the same point will reach us at a time \u223c \u03b4T + T90 , where T90\nis the duration of the prompt \u03b3\u2212ray emission. After the ceasing of the re-activity of the\ncentral engine, the curvature emission component follows\n(1)\n\nFA (t) \u221d (\n\nT90 + \u03b4T + t \u2212(2+\u03b2)\n)\n,\nTA\n\nthe decline could be very steep as long as T90 + \u03b4T \u226b TA and thus could account for\nsome X-ray flare observations.\nPhase-II: The shallow decline of the early X-ray lightcurve and the chromatic break. In about half Swift GRBs, the X-ray lightcurves are distinguished by\na long term flattening and there is no spectral evolution detected before and after the\nshallow-to-\"normal\" decline transition, which is consistent with a strong energy injection\n[1, 2, 11]. However, for some GRBs with good quality multi-wavelength afterglow data,\nthe X-ray and optical lightcurves break chromatically (see Figure 1 for an illustrative\nplot) and thus challenge the energy injection model [12, 13].\nOne possible solution is to modify the basic assumption made in the standard external\nshock model. Following [12, 13, 14], we assume that (i) The density of the medium\nis a function of R as n \u221d R\u2212k ; (ii) The shock physical parameters \u01ebe and \u01ebB , i.e.,\nthe fractions of shock energy giving to the downstream electrons and magnetic field,\nare shock strength dependent; (iii) There might be an energy injection taking a form\ndEinj /dt \u221d t\u2212q and thus changes the dynamics/emission of the GRB ejecta. The last\n2+q\u2212k\n\n2+q\u2212k\n\ntwo assumptions yield (\u01ebe , \u01ebB ) \u221d (\u0393\u2212b , \u0393\u2212c ) \u221d (t 2(4\u2212k) b , t 2(4\u2212k) c ) \u2261 (tb , tc ) for \u0393 \u2265 \u03930 ,\n2+q\u2212k\n\n2+q\u2212k\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\notherwise (\u01ebe , \u01ebB ) \u221d (\u0393\u2212d , \u0393\u2212e ) \u221d (t 2(4\u2212k) d , t 2(4\u2212k) e ) \u2261 (td , te ), where \u03930 is the Lorentz\nfactor of the outflow at the X-ray decline transition. The parameters (b, c, d, e) are\nassumed to be constant and may be different from each other, so are (b\u2032 , c\u2032 , d\u2032 , e\u2032 ).\nWith these three assumptions and following the standard afterglow treatment [15],\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nrate \u223c a few \u00d7 10\u22123 M\u2299 s\u22121 . The outflow luminosity could be high to \u223c 1048 \u2212 1049 erg s\u22121\n[10]. The accretion rate is unsteady, so is the energy output. In this model, the timescale, the\nluminosity, and the multipile structure of the X-ray flare following short GRBs could be well\nreproduced. The very late X-ray flares are powered by the fall-back accretion of the material\nejected in the WD-SS merger. There could also be some precursors-Before the SS collapses to\nBH, the accretion of the WD material on the SS may give rise to significant emission.\n\n\f4\n\nYI-ZHONG FAN,\n\nwe have the scaling laws (i.e., an extension of Table 2 of [1])\n\n(2) F\u03bd\u2295\n\n\uf8f1\n4\u22126k\u22122q+3qk\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nfor \u03bd\u2295 < \u03bdc < \u03bdm ;\n\u01ebB (1 + Y )2/3 t(1\u2212q)+ 3(4\u2212k)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u22121/4\n(1\u2212q)+ 2k\u22128\u2212qk+4q\n\u22121\n\uf8f4\n4(4\u2212k)\n\uf8f4\nfor \u03bdc < \u03bd\u2295 < \u03bdm ;\n\uf8f2 \u01ebB (1 + Y ) t\nk(1\u2212q/2)\n\u22122/3 1/3 (1\u2212q)+ 2+q\n\u2212\n6\n4\u2212k\n\u221d\n\u01ebe \u01ebB t\nfor \u03bd\u2295 < \u03bdm < \u03bdc ;\n\uf8f4\n(p\u22121)(2+q)\nk(1\u2212q/2)\n\uf8f4\n\u2212 4\u2212k\n\uf8f4\np\u22121 (p+1)/4 (1\u2212q)\u2212\n4\n\uf8f4\n\u01ebe \u01ebB\nt\nfor \u03bdm < \u03bd\u2295 < \u03bdc ;\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n(2\u2212q)k\u22128+4q\n(p\u22121)(2+q)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 p\u22121 p\u22122\n+\n\u22121 (1\u2212q)\u2212\n4\n4\n4(4\u2212k)\nfor \u03bd\u2295 > max{\u03bdc , \u03bdm },\n\u01ebe \u01ebB (1 + Y ) t\n\nwhere \u03bd\u2295 is the observer frequency; \u03bdc and \u03bdm are the standard cooling frequency and\nthe typical synchrotron radiation frequency of the shocked electrons, respectively; Y is\nthe synchrotron self-Compton parameter. However, the time evolving shock parameters\nrender an estimate on Y very difficult. For simplicity, one can assume\nthat Y \u223c 0\np\nwhen the synchrotron self-Compton is unimportant and (1 + Y ) \u223c \u01ebe /\u01ebB when the\nsynchrotron self-Compton is important (i.e., Y \u226b 1).\nSubstituting such a simplified Y into equation (2) and assuming each set of (k, q) is\nfixed (i.e., they take standard values (0, 1), respectively) or b\u2032 = d\u2032 and c\u2032 = e\u2032 , one thus\ncan constrain the parameters (b\u2032 , c\u2032 , d\u2032 , e\u2032 ) or (k, q, b\u2032 , c\u2032 ) with the optical and X-ray\ntemporal indexes-the solution is straightforward since four parameters to be determined\nusing four relations. But one crucial problem is that such an approach, in particular the\nconsideration of evolving shock parameters, is phenomenological and lacks the physical\nbasis.\nConclusion and Implication. The GRB afterglow may be attributed to the continued activity of the central engine and thus should be named as the \"central engine\nafterglow\" [16]. This idea was first proposed in the context of GRB 970228 [17]. However, the consistency between the predictions of the afterglow external shock model and\nmost pre-Swift afterglow multi-wavelength observations leads to that this model has been\nwidely accepted. The situation might change in the Swift era. Now it's evident that central engine plays an important role on shaping the early afterglow. For example, the\ndying of the central engine could give rise to the sharp but not very sharp early X-ray\ndecline, i.e., phase-I. The re-activity of the central engine could power the energetic Xray flares, i.e., phase-V. The long activity of the central engine could give rise to the\npower-law decaying X-ray afterglow, as found in GRB 060218 [18, 16]. We conclude that\nthe role of the central engine should be taken into account seriously when interpreting\nGRB afterglows, in contrast to what we believed before.\n\u2217 \u2217 \u2217\nYZF thanks the conference organizers for partial support and T.
