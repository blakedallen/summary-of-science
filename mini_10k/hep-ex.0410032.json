Other components are a hodoscope for precise track time\ndetermination, a hadronic calorimeter and a muon veto.\nThe data sample used for all the three analyses was taken in 1999 during a dedicated minumum\nbias run without KS beam; similar selection criteria were adopted throughout in order to select\nthe events.\n\n\f2\n\nPhysics Motivations for the Study of Kaon Semileptonic Decays\n\nThe renewed interest in the study of the semiletponic KL decays is related to the long standing\nproblem about the unitarity of the CKM matrix. The unitarity of the CKM matrix requires for\nthe first row that:\n|Vud |2 + |Vus |2 + |Vub |2 = 1\n\n(1)\n\na significant departure from unity in this relation would imply the breaking of unitarity and the\nexistence of new physics. PDG 2004 2 values indicates a 2.2 \u03c3 deviation from unity and |Vus | is\nresponsible for about 50% of the error. |Vus | can be extracted from the kaon semileptonic decays\n(Kl3 , l = e, \u03bc) width via the relation:\n\u0393Kl3 =\n\n5\nG2F MK\nl\nl\nSEW (1 + \u03b4K\n) C 2 |Vus |2 f+2 (0) IK\n(\u03bb+ , \u03bb0 )\n192\u03c0 3\n\n(2)\n\nl the short and the\nwhere GF is the Fermi coupling constant, MK the kaon mass, SEW and \u03b4K\n2\n0\n\u00b1\nlong distance radiative corrections, C is 1 for KL and 1/2 for K decays, f+ (0) is the calculated\nl (\u03bb , \u03bb ) is the phase space integral which\nform factor at zero momentum transfer and finally IK\n+ 0\ndepends on the two form factors which describe the decay. Being pure vector transitions the\nKl3 decays suffer only from second order corrections in the simmetry breaking and therefore are\nthe most accurate and theoretically cleanest way to extract |Vus |.\n+ 3\nRecent measurements from Ke3\nand K0e3 (KTeV 4 , KLOE 7 for KS ) are significantly above\nPDG values \"restoring\" unitarity, however their branching ratio are not in agreement with PDG\naverages. New experimental (and theoretical) inputs are therefore needed to clarify the situation.\n\n3\n\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bde Branching Ratio and Extraction of |Vus |\n\nThe determination of the BR(Ke3 ) proceeds through the measurement of the ratio R of the\ndecay rate of K0e3 relative to all decays with two charged particles in the final state (2T ), namely\n\u03c0e\u03bd, \u03c0e\u03bc, \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 0 , \u03c0 + \u03c0 \u2212 , and 3 \u03c0 0 with Dalitz decay of one \u03c0 0 .\nR =\n\nNKe3 /AKe3\n\u0393(Ke3 )\n=\n\u0393(2T )\nN2T /A2T\n\n(3)\n\nNi and Ai being the number of reconstructed events and the acceptance, respectively. Since the\nBRs of the neutral channels have been measured, the sum of BRs of all KL decay modes with\ntwo charged tracks BR(2T ) is experimentally known:\nBR(2T ) = 1 \u2212 BR(All N eutral) = 1.0048 \u2212 BR(3\u03c0 0 )\n\n(4)\n\nand BR(Ke3 ) can be derived from R : BR(Ke3 ) = R \u00d7 BR(2T ). The K0e3 events were selected using exactly the same selection as the 2T events with in addition the requirement of\ne identification from the LKr calorimeter. This was done (see Fig. 1a) requiring E/p > 0.93\nwhere E is the energy released in the calorimeter and p is the track momentum measured in\nthe spectrometer. The number of K0e3 accepted events amounts to 6.8 106 . The background\nfrom K\u03bc3 /K3\u03c0 events with a \u03c0 misidentified as an electron was estimated from K0e3 data with\nidentified e (E/p > 1) and is 5.8 10\u22123 . The inefficiency of electron ID is determined from\nK0e3 data with identified \u03c0 (0.3 < E/p < 0.7) and its value is 4.9 10\u22123 . The detector response\nwas reproduced using a GEANT based simulation. The average two track acceptance was obtained from a mean of the individual acceptances weighted with their BR. These were evaluated\ncombining together PDG and the recent KTeV 5 results. We obtained 6 R = 0.4975\u00b1 0.0035 and\nBR(Ke3 ) = 0.4010 \u00b1 0.0028exp \u00b1 0.0035norm where the first error is the complete experimental\n\n\fx10\n\n3\n\n0.224\n0.222\n0.22\n0.218\n0.216\n0.214\n0.212\n0.21\n\n4000\nelectrons\n\n3000\npions\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\nDivided by 1.022+-0.005\n\nNA48\nE865\nKTeV\nKLOE KS\n\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n1.2\nE/p: energy deposited in Lkr / track momentum\n\nFigure 1: (a) E/p distribution of selected K0e3 events.

To determine |Vus | we followed the prescription of Ref. 8 obtaining |Vus |f+ (0) = 0.2146 \u00b1 0.0016. Using their value of f+ (0) = 0.981 \u00b1 0.010\nwe get:\n|Vus | = 0.2187 \u00b1 0.0016exp \u00b1 0.0023theo\n(5)\nThe experimental number of |V |f (0) is in agreement with the recent KTeV results 4 but larger\nus\n\n+\n\nthan the PDG one. The result on |Vus | is still 2.4 \u03c3 lower than what required by CKM unitarity\nand it is dominated by the theoretical uncertainties.\n4\n\nKL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bde Form Factors\n\nAssuming that only the vector coupling contributes to the decay, the matrix element can be\nwritten in terms of two dimensionless form factors f\u00b1 (t) :\n\u221a\n(6)\nM = GF / 2 Vus [f+ (t) (PK + P\u03c0 )\u03bc \u016bl \u03b3\u03bc (1 + \u03b35 )u\u03bd + f\u2212 (t) ml \u016bl (1 + \u03b35 )u\u03bd ]\nwhere ml is the lepton mass, \u016bl and u\u03bd are the lepton spinors and PK and P\u03c0 are the kaon and\npion four\u2013momenta respectively. Since the contribution of f\u2212 is proportional to the lepton mass\nsquared it can be neglected in K0e3 decays. The determination of the form factor is based on the\nmeasurement of the Dalitz plot density:\n\u03c1(Ee\u2217 , E\u03c0\u2217 ) =\n\ndN 2 (Ee\u2217 , E\u03c0\u2217 )\n\u221d f+2 (t) A\ndEe\u2217 dE\u03c0\u2217\n\n(7)\n\nA is a kinematical term and Ee\u2217 and E\u03c0\u2217 are the electron and pion energies in the kaon c.m.,\nrespectively. An usual assumption is that the form factor depends lineraly on t (the square of\nthe four\u2013momentum transferred to the lepton system): f+ (t) = f+ (0)(1 + \u03bb+ t/m2\u03c0 ).\nA fit comparing the data and the MC expectations was performed in order to extract the form\nfactors.

The\nevents are selected in the same manner as the K0e3 events adding the requirement of exactly one\n\u03b3 in the LKr calorimeter. To take into account the effect of the radiative corrections (real and\nvirtual) the Monte Carlo events, generated with the PHOTOS 9 package, were modified in order\nto reproduce the data. This was achieved by weighting the MC events with the distribution,\n\u2217 the angle between the electron and the photon in the kaon c.m.\nobtained from the data, of \u03b8e\u03b3\nIn this way the agreement between data and MC has been found very good for all the variables.\nThe preliminary result of the branching ratio measurement is:\n\u2217 > 20\u25e6 )\nBR(KL \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 e\u2213 \u03bde \u03b3, E\u03b3\u2217 > 30M eV, \u03b8e\u03b3\n= (0.964 \u00b1 0.008+0.012\n\u22120.011 )%\nBR(Ke3 )\n\n(10)\n\nAs it can be seen in Fig. 2a, this is in good agreement with theoretical predictions 10,11 and\nrecent ChPT calculations 12,13 and in disagreement with the other high precision measurement\ndone by the KTeV collaboration 14 .\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n13.\n14.\n\nA.
