We exhibit several transformations of surfaces in R4 . First, one\nthat takes a flat surface and gets a surface with flat normal bundle; then, one\nthat takes a surface with flat normal bundle and gets a flat surface; finally,\na one-parameter family of transformations on a flat surface with flat normal\nbundle and gives a flat surface with flat normal bundle. This family satisfies a\npermutability property.\n\n1. Introduction\nAmong surfaces in R4 , those of flat tangent bundle and those of flat normal\nbundle have received considerable attention, especially those that have both properties.\nIn this paper, we present several transformations between surfaces of those\ntypes. In [2] we find a transformation that takes a hyper-spherical surface (hence,\nof flat normal bundle), and gets a flat surface. We present here a transformation\nthat takes any surface with flat normal bundle without inflection points and\nconverts it to its evolute, which results in a flat surface; the condition (no inflection\npoints) is meant to shun the possibility that the map go to infinity, as happens\nin a point with zero curvature when defining the evolute of a plane curve.\nThen there is a kind of inverse, that is a transformation that takes any immersed flat surface in R4 and gives (in the region where that transformation is\nan immersion) its envelope, which is a surface with flat normal bundle without\ninflection points.\nThus, it seems that the differential equations that define surfaces in R4 with\nflat normal bundle are essentially the same as those that define flat surfaces.\nBy combining both types of transformations we get a transformation, ft : M \u2192\nft (M), which depends on a real parameter t, and yields a flat surface with flat\nnormal bundle without inflection points from a surface with the same properties.\nThese transformations satisfy an analogous to the Bianchi permutability theorem\nfor B\u00e4cklund transformations (see [1] for a description in a broad context).\nAll the transformations f : M \u2192 f (M) so far described are \"orthogonal\" in\nthe sense that the tangent plane of f (M) at f (p) is the orthogonal complement of\nthe tangent plane of M at p. The composition of two such transformations gives\nDate: September 25, 2018.\nWork partially supported by DGCYT grant n. BFM2003-02037.\n1\n\n\fa \"parallel\" transformation, that is one such that the tangent plane of f (M) at\nf (p) is equal to the tangent plane of M at p.\n2. Basic concepts and notation\nIn the following, M will be a surface immersed in Rn . However, since all of our\nstudy will be local, one can without loss of rigor assume that M is an embedded\nsurface. On M we have the tangent bundle \u03c0 : T M \u2192 M, and the normal bundle\ngiven by\nNM = \u222ap\u2208M (Tp M)\u22a5 , \u03c0N : NM \u2192 M,\nwhere (Tp M)\u22a5 denotes the subspace of Tp Rn orthogonal to Tp M. Its fibre upon\np \u2208 M will be denoted by Np M = (Tp M)\u22a5 . Usually we will consider Tp M and\nNp M as vector subspaces of Rn . We will use a dot to mean the standard inner\nproduct. If X \u2208 Tp Rn , we will have X = X \u22a4 +X \u22a5 , with X \u22a4 \u2208 Tp M, X \u22a5 \u2208 Np M.\nThe Lie algebra of vector fields on a manifold M will be denoted X(M), and\nif E is the total space of a vector bundle over M, \u0393E will stand for the C \u221e (M)module of its differentiable sections. Usually, if s is a section of a fiber bundle,\nsp will be its value at p.\nThe ordinary directional derivative in Rn will be written as DX . But note that\nit may have a broader meaning of which we will have a frequent use. In fact, if S\nis a submanifold of Rn , p \u2208 S, Xp \u2208 Tp S and f : S \u2192 Rm is a differentiable map,\nthen DXp f \u2208 Rm will be defined as df (Xp) \u2208 Tf (p) Rm \u2248 Rm . For vector fields on\nRm , D is a metric linear connection with zero torsion and curvature.\nLet u \u2208 \u0393NM and p \u2208 M. The map Aup : Tp M \u2192 Tp M defined by Aup (X) =\n(DX u)\u22a4 , depends only on the value up of u at p and it is self-adjoint with respect\nto the inner product. The second fundamental form of M, \u03b1, may be defined\nat p as the symmetric bilinear form \u03b1p : Tp M \u00d7 Tp M \u2192 Np M that satisfies\nup * \u03b1p (Xp , Yp ) = \u2212Aup (Xp ) * Yp , for any Xp , Yp \u2208 Tp M, up \u2208 Np M. We have\nequivalently\n\u03b1(X, Y ) = (DX Y )\u22a5 , X, Y \u2208 X(M).\n\u22a4\nThe map X(M) \u00d7 X(M) \u2192 X(M) given by \u2207\u22a4\nX Y = (DX Y ) is a torsionless\nmetric linear connection. If its curvature is zero everywhere, we say that M is\nflat; in this case, if p is any point of M, there is a chart \u03c8 : (u, v) \u2208 U \u2282 R2 \u2192 M\nsuch that p \u2208 \u03c8(U) and that the pull-back of the first fundamental form of M by\n\u22a5\n\u03c8 reads du2 + dv 2 . The map X(M) \u00d7 \u0393NM \u2192 \u0393NM given by \u2207\u22a5\nX u = (DX u)\nis a metric linear connection. It its curvature is zero everywhere, we say that the\nnormal bundle of M is flat.\nLet P Tp M the projective space of vector lines of Tp M. The second fundamental\nform defines a map \u03b7p : P Tp M \u2192 Np M, by\n\n\u03b1p (t, t)\n, t \u2208 Tp M\\{0}.\nt*t\nThe image of \u03b7p is an ellipse in Np M, called the curvature ellipse at p. If that\nellipse lies in an affine line (i.e. it degenerates to a segment or to a point), we\n\u03b7p ([t]) = \u03b7p (t) =\n\n2\n\n\fsay that p is a semiumbilic point. If, in addition, that line passes by the origin\nof Np M, we say that p is a point of inflection.\nThe following facts are well known or easily proved (see for instance [4], [5]\nand [3]). The point p is semiumbilic iff the curvature of \u2207\u22a5 vanishes at p. So,\nM is totally semiumbilic iff its normal bundle is flat. If p is semiumbilic and\n[t] \u2208 P Tp M is such that \u03b7p ([t]) is equal to any of the ends of the segment in\nwhich the curvature ellipse degenerates, then we say that [t] (or t) is an asymptotic\ndirection at p; if that segment does not degenerate to a point at p (umbilic point)\nthen there are two asymptotic directions at p and they are mutually orthogonal.\nIf p is semiumbilic, then the curvature of \u2207\u22a4 vanishes at p iff the circle that has\nthe curvature segment as diameter passes by the origin of Np M; or, equivalently\nif p is not umbilic, iff \u03b7p (t1 ) and \u03b7p (t2 ) are orthogonal, where t1 and t2 are the\nasymptotic directions at p. If, in addition, p is not of inflection, \u03b7p (t1 ) and \u03b7p (t2 )\nare linearly independent.\n3. Some facts on semiumbilical surfaces\nThe following characterization of semiumbilic points will be crucial for our\nresults. This definition differs from the first one that I know, that of Wong\n[6]. The reason is that for surfaces in Rn with n \u2265 5, Wong condition of being\nsemiumbilic is satisfied \"almost everywhere\", that is, in addition to the points\nthat are semiumbilic for us, whenever the curvature ellipse does not degenerate\nand the affine plane containing it does not pass by the origin.\nProposition 3.1. Let M be an immersed surface in Rn , n \u2265 4, p \u2208 M be a\nnon umbilic point and g denote the first fundamental form of M. Then there is\nan affine plane Ep that passes by the origin of Np M and contains the curvature\nellipse at p and there is a vector cp \u2208 Ep such that cp * \u03b1p = gp , iff p is a non\ninflection semiumbilic point. Moreover if such a vector cp exists, it is unique.\nProof. If such a plane Ep and vector cp exist, then for each unit vector t \u2208 Tp M\nwe will have cp * \u03b1p (t, t) = cp * \u03b7p (t) = gp (t, t) = 1. Therefore, the height of all\npoints of the curvature ellipse at p over the hyperplane Hp of Np M with normal\ncp is constant and equal to |c1p | . Therefore, the curvature ellipse lies in the line\nof intersection of Ep with the affine hyperplane parallel to Hp at that distance,\nso that p is semiumbilic and obviously it cannot be of inflection without being\numbilic.\nConversely, if p is a non inflection semiumbilic point, let np be the point of the\nline containing the curvature ellipse at p (a segment) nearest to the origin of Np M.\nSince p is not an inflection point np 6= 0. Let cp = npn*np p . Since np * \u03b7p (t) = np * np ,\nfor all unit vectors t \u2208 Tp M, se will have cp * \u03b7p (t) = 1 = gp (t, t). Since cp * \u03b7p is\na quadratic form on Tp M, we conclude that its corresponding bilinear symmetric\nform cp * \u03b1p is equal to gp . The uniqueness of cp is obvious.\n\u0003\nIn R4 we can dispense with the requirement of a plane Ep to contain cp because\nNp M does the job. Thus\n3\n\n\fCorollary 3.2. Let M be an immersed surface in R4 , p \u2208 M be a non umbilic\npoint and g denote the first fundamental form of M. Then there is a unique vector\ncp \u2208 Np M such that cp * \u03b1p = gp iff p is a non inflection semiumbilic point.\nFrom now on, unless otherwise stated, M will be a surface immersed in R4 .\nWe describe now the curvature ellipse in more concrete terms. If (t1 , t2 ) is a\nlocal orthonormal frame of T M, we put b1 = \u03b7(t1 ) = \u03b1(t1 , t1 ), b2 = \u03b7(t2 ) =\n\u03b1(t2 , t2 ), b3 = \u03b1(t1 , t2 ). If t \u2208 X(M) is a unit vector field, we will have t =\nt1 cos \u03b8 + t2 sin \u03b8. Then, we have \u03b7(t) = b1 cos2 \u03b8 + b2 sin2 \u03b8 + b3 sin 2\u03b8. After an\neasy calculation we get\n\u03b7(t) = H + B cos 2\u03b8 + C sin 2\u03b8,\nwhere\n\n1\n1\nH = (b1 + b2 ), B = (b1 \u2212 b2 ), C = b3\n2\n2\nare smooth local sections of NM.\nH is called mean curvature vector (field) and it does not depend on the choice\nof the orthonormal frame (t1 , t2 ). The other two sections B and C do depend on\nit. In a region where the ellipse does not degenerate to a point or a circle, the\nframe (t1 , t2 ) can be locally chosen so that the major half-axis of the ellipse be B\nand the minor, C. That is |B| \u2265 |C|, and B *C = 0. We denote by J : NM \u2192 NM\na local fibred map such that J(Np M) = Np M, J 2 = \u2212 id, Ju * u = 0, Ju * Ju =\nu * u, \u2200u \u2208 NM. Then J is defined up to a sign.\nFor avoiding annoying repetitions we will say that the immersed surface M is\nsemiumbilical if all of its points are non inflection semiumbilic points.\nProposition 3.3. Let M be an immersed semiumbilical surface in R4 . Let the\nlocal orthonormal frame (t1 , t2 ) of T M satisfy b3 = \u03b1(t1 , t2 ) = 0. Then the section\nJB\n,\nH * JB\nwhere B = 21 (\u03b1(t1 , t1 ) \u2212 \u03b1(t2 , t2 )), H = 21 (\u03b1(t1 , t1 ) + \u03b1(t2 , t2 )) is well defined and\nsatisfies c * \u03b1 = g.\nc=\n\nProof. Since there are no inflection points in M, the curvature ellipse at each\npoint is a segment not collinear with the origin, that is b1 and b2 are linearly\nindependent. The frame (t1 , t2 ) is simply a local frame of asymptotic directions.\nWe have first H * JB = 41 (b1 + b2 ) * (Jb1 \u2212 Jb2 ) = \u2212 12 b1 * Jb2 6= 0 because b1 and\nb2 are linearly independent. Therefore,\nc * \u03b1(t1 , t1 ) =\n\nJb1 \u2212 Jb2\n* b1 = 1 = t1 * t1 .\n\u2212b1 * Jb2\n\nIn the same manner we get c * \u03b1(t2 , t2 ) = t2 * t2 = 1. Since \u03b1(t1 , t2 ) = 0, we have\nfinally c * \u03b1 = g.\n\u0003\nThe following result will be used afterwards, in the context of surfaces with\nboth bundles, normal and tangent, flat.\n4\n\n\fLemma 3.4. Let M be a semiumbilical immersed surface in R4 . Let the local\northonormal frame (t1 , t2 ) of T M satisfy b3 = \u03b1(t1 , t2 ) = 0 and put b1 = \u03b1(t1 , t1 ),\nb2 = \u03b1(t2 , t2 ). Then\n\u22a5\nb1 * \u2207\u22a5\nt2 c = b2 * \u2207t1 c = 0.\nProof. We have 0 = \u03b1(t1 , t2 ) = (Dt1 t2 )\u22a5 = (Dt2 t1 )\u22a5 . Therefore, Dt1 t2 , Dt2 t1 \u2208\nX(M). Now,\n\u22a5\nb1 * \u2207\u22a5\nt2 c = b1 * Dt2 c = \u03b1(t1 , t1 ) * Dt2 c = (Dt1 t1 ) * Dt2 c\n\n= Dt2 ((Dt1 t1 )\u22a5 * c) \u2212 c * Dt2 (Dt1 t1 )\u22a5\n= Dt2 (c * \u03b1(t1 , t1 )) \u2212 c * Dt2 (Dt1 t1 \u2212 (Dt1 t1 )\u22a4 )\n= Dt2 (1) \u2212 c * Dt2 Dt1 t1 + c * \u03b1(t2 , (Dt1 t1 )\u22a4 )\n= \u2212c * (Dt1 Dt2 t1 + D[t2 ,t1 ] t1 ) + t2 * Dt1 t1 .\nNow we observe that [t2 , t1 ], Dt2 t1 \u2208 X(M), whence\nb1 * \u2207\u22a5\nt2 c = \u2212t1 * Dt2 t1 \u2212 [t2 , t1 ] * t1 \u2212 t1 * Dt1 t2 = 0,\nbecause t1 * Dt2 t1 = 0 and [t2 , t1 ] = Dt2 t1 \u2212 Dt1 t2 . In the same manner we get\nb2 * \u2207\u22a5\n\u0003\nt1 c = 0.\n4. Transformations between surfaces with flat tangent bundle\nand surfaces with flat normal bundle in R4\nA good part of our results are based in the following observations:\nLemma 4.1. Let U, V be two surfaces immersed in R4 and let f : U \u2192 V be a\ndiffeomorphism such that for any p \u2208 U we have Tp U = Nq V, where q = f (p).\nThen, a section Y of T U satisfies \u2207\u22a4 Y = 0 (is parallel) iff \u1ef8 = Y \u25e6 f \u22121 , which\nis a section of NV, satisfies \u2207\u22a5 \u1ef8 = 0 (is parallel). And a section u of NU is\nparallel iff u \u25e6 f \u22121 , which is a section of T V, is parallel.\nProof. We have \u1ef8q = (Y \u25e6 f \u22121 )f (p) = Yp \u2208 Tp U = Nq V ; hence \u1ef8 is a section of\nNV. Let X \u2208 Tp U = Nq V, u \u2208 Np U = Tq V. We will have\n\u22121\nX *\u2207\u22a5\n(u)) = X *Ddf \u22121 (u) Y = X *\u2207\u22a4\nu \u1ef8 = X *Du \u1ef8 = X *d\u1ef8 (u) = X *dY (df\ndf \u22121 (u) Y,\n\nand now both claims are evident.\n\n\u0003\n\nFor the previous Lemma we did need that the ambient space were R4 because\n4 = 2 dim(Tp U) = dim(Tp U) + dim(Nq V ) = dim(Tp U) + dim(Np U)\nis the dimension of the ambient space. In the following this condition is not\nnecessary. The proof is similar.\nLemma 4.2. Let U, V be two surfaces immersed in Rn and let f : U \u2192 V be a\ndiffeomorphism such that for any p \u2208 U we have Tp U = Tq V, where q = f (p).\nThen, a section Y of T U is parallel iff \u1ef8 = Y \u25e6 f \u22121 , which is a section of T V, is\nparallel. And a section u of NU is parallel iff u \u25e6 f \u22121 , which is a section of NV,\nis parallel.\n5\n\n\fNow we begin to study the conditions to have diffeomorphisms as those used\nin the preceding Lemmas.\nProposition 4.3. Let M be an immersed surface in Rn . Then the following\nstatements are equivalent:\n(1) M is flat;\n(2) Given any point p \u2208 M, there is an open neighborhood U of p in M and\na vector field e \u2208 X(U) such that \u2207\u22a4\nX e = X for all X \u2208 X(U);\n(3) Given any point p \u2208 M, there is an open neighborhood U of p in M and\na vector field e \u2208 X(U) such that for any q \u2208 U we have df (Tq U) \u2282 Nq U,\nwhere f : U \u2192 Rn is the map defined by f (q) = q \u2212 eq , that is f = id \u2212e.\nProof. (1) \u21d4 (2). If M is flat, there is a chart \u03bc in an open neighborhood U of p,\nwith coordinates (u, v) whose first fundamental form reads du2 + dv 2 . This means\nthat the vector field e = u\u03bcu + v\u03bcv satisfies the required property because \u03bcu , \u03bcv\nare parallel. This field e is determined upto the addition of a parallel tangent\nvector field on U. Conversely, if e \u2208 X(U) satisfies the condition, then for any\nX, Y \u2208 X(U) we have\n\u22a4\n\u22a4 \u22a4\n\u22a4\n\u22a4\n\u22a4\nR\u22a4 (X, Y )e = \u2207\u22a4\nX \u2207Y e \u2212 \u2207Y \u2207X e \u2212 \u2207[X,Y ] e = \u2207X Y \u2212 \u2207Y X \u2212 [X, Y ] = 0,\n\nbecause \u2207\u22a4 is torsionless. Since e can vanish only at isolated points and the\ndimension of M is 2, we conclude that R\u22a4 = 0.\n(2) \u21d4 (3). Let e : U \u2192 T U be a local section of T M and let X, Y \u2208 Tq M, q \u2208\nU. Then Y * df (X) = Y * (X \u2212 de(X)) = Y * (X \u2212 DX e) = Y * (X \u2212 \u2207\u22a4\nX e) and\nnow our claim is evident.\n\u0003\nFor M flat, and assuming that the field e is defined in all of M, let f =\nid \u2212e : M \u2192 Rn and assume that for some X \u2208 Tp M we have df (X) = 0. This\nwould be equivalent to say that for any u \u2208 Np M we had 0 = u * df (X) =\nu * (X \u2212 DX e) = \u2212u * DX e = \u2212u * \u03b1p (ep , X) = 0, that is \u03b1p (ep , X) = 0, that\nis {0} =\n6 ker \u03b1p (ep , ) : Tp M \u2192 Np M. If n = 3, this always happens, so that for\nthat dimension f is never an immersion. Probably, if n = 4, df would generically\nnot be one-to-one only along some curves; if n > 4, f would be an immersion\ngenerically outside isolated points, and so on. However, I shall not dwell on this\npoint.\nAssume that in fact f be an immersion, and let \u03c6 = (f |U )\u22121 for some open\nU \u2282 M such that f |U : U \u2192 V = f (U) is a diffeomorphism. Then \u03c6 = idV +e\u25e6\u03c6,\nas it can be proved easily. Since Tq V = df (Tp U) \u2282 Np U, we will have Tp U \u2282 Nq V.\nHence, c = e \u25e6 \u03c6 is a section of NV and the map \u03c6 = id +c satisfies d\u03c6(Tq V ) =\nTp U \u2282 Nq V. This motivates the following proposition.\nProposition 4.4. Let M be an immersed surface in Rn with normal bundle NM\nand first and second fundamental forms g and \u03b1, respectively. Let c \u2208 \u0393NM\nand put f = id +c : M \u2192 Rn . Then c * \u03b1 = g iff for each p \u2208 M we have\ndf (Tp M) \u2282 Np M.\n6\n\n\fProof. Let p \u2208 M, X, Y \u2208 Tp M. Then\nY * (df )p (X) = Y * (X + (dc)p (X)) = Y * (X + DX c)\n= Y * (X + Ac (X)) = g(X, Y ) \u2212 c * \u03b1(X, Y ),\nand our claim is now evident.\n\n\u0003\n\nAssume now that c \u2208 \u0393NM satisfies c * \u03b1 = g, and let f = id +c : M \u2192 Rn .\nIf p \u2208 M, let us study the condition for dfp not being one-to-one. This happens\niff there is some non vanishing vector X \u2208 Tp M such that, for all u \u2208 Np M\nthe following holds: u * dfp (X) = u * (X + DX c) = u * \u2207\u22a5\nX c = 0. That is iff\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n{0} =\n6 ker (\u2207 c)p : X \u2208 Tp M 7\u2192 \u2207X c \u2208 Np M. As before, we see that if n = 3, f\ncannot be an immersion, and that, probably, for n = 4 it fails generically to be\nso only on some curves, etc.\nThe condition cp * \u03b1p = gp says that the height of the curvature ellipse with\nrespect to the vector hyperplane of Np M orthogonal to cp is constant and equal\nto |c1p | . If n = 3 this entails that p is umbilic and not planar. If n = 4 this\nhappens only if the ellipse degenerates to a point, not the origin, or to an affine\nsegment not collinear with the origin. If, finally, n > 4, this may occur almost\nalways, because it is equivalent to require only that the least affine subspace of\nNp M that contains the curvature ellipse does not pass by the origin.\nThe next two Theorems, that are part of our main results explain why from\nnow on we consider only surfaces in R4 . Roughly, they establish a transformation\nof a surface with flat normal bundle to a flat surface, and a transformation that\ntakes a flat surface and converts it to a surface with flat normal bundle.\nTheorem 4.5. Let M be a semiumbilical surface immersed in R4 . If c is the\nsection of NM described in 3.3 that satisfies c * \u03b1 = g, and f = id +c : M \u2192 R4\nis an immersion, then f (M) is an immersed flat surface that we call the evolute\nof M. If, in addition, M is flat, then f (M) is semiumbilical.\nProof. Let U be an open subset of M for which f : U \u2192 V = f (U) is a diffeomorphism. We will have \u03c6 = (f |U )\u22121 = idV \u2212c \u25e6 \u03c6, and d\u03c6(Tq V ) \u2282 Nq V.\nTaking account of the dimensions, we conclude that df (Tp U) = Np U = Tq V and\nd\u03c6(Tq V ) = Tp U = Nq V. By the same reason, \u1ebd = c * \u03c6 is a section of T V . Our\nclaims are now a consequence of 4.3 and 4.1. In fact, M is flat iff there is a\nnonvanishing parallel vector field on M, and all its points are semiumbilic iff its\nnormal bundle is flat, that is iff it admits a nonvanishing parallel section. In both\ncases, due to the dimension 2 of those bundles. The question whether f (M) has\ninflection points when M is semiumbilical and flat will be settled below (Theorem\n5.5(1)) under a more general context.\n\u0003\nHad we assumed that n > 4, we could not conclude that e was tangent to V\nnor that V was flat.\nTheorem 4.6. Let M be a surface immersed in R4 . Let e \u2208 X(M) be such that\n4\n\u2207\u22a4\nX e = X, \u2200X \u2208 X(M) (hence, M is flat) and put f = id \u2212e : M \u2192 R . Then,\nif f is an immersion, the immersed surface f (M) is semiumbilical and we will\n7\n\n\fsay that it is an envelope of M. If, in addition, M is semiumbilical, then f (M)\nis flat.\nProof. If we put locally \u03c6 = f \u22121 , and c = e\u25e6\u03c6, then \u03c6 = id +c, and d\u03c6(Tq f (M)) =\nNq f (M), and we conclude with the aid of 4.4 and 4.1.\n\u0003\nThe evolute of a non-flat semiumbilical surface is unique. On the contrary,\nthere are many envelopes of a flat surface. In fact, it is enough to add a parallel\nvector field Z \u2208 X(M) to e. However, if a semiumbilical surface is also flat, then\nthere may be more evolutes. This is a consequence of this proposition that is\nslightly more general.\nProposition 4.7. Let M be a flat semiumbilical surface in Rn , let Z \u2208 X(M) be\na parallel vector field and put f = id +c + Z : M \u2192 Rn . Then df (Tp M) \u2282 Np M\nfor any p \u2208 M.\nProof. Let X, Y \u2208 Tp M. Using 4.4, we have:\nY * df (X) = Y * DX Z = Y * \u2207\u22a4\nX Z = 0.\n\u0003\n5. Transformations of surfaces in R4 with tangent and normal\nbundles both flat\nAs we have recalled, if a surface is flat and semiumbilical, there is, in a neighborhood of any point, an orthonormal frame (t1 , t2 ) of asymptotic directions,\nsuch that, if b1 = \u03b1(t1 , t1 ) = (Dt1 t1 )\u22a5 , b2 = \u03b1(t2 , t2 ) = (Dt2 t2 )\u22a5 , b3 = \u03b1(t1 , t2 ) =\n(Dt1 t2 )\u22a5 , we have:\n(1) b1 and b2 are linearly independent at each point;\n(2) b1 * b2 = 0, b3 = 0.\nWith this notation, we have:\nProposition 5.1. Let M be a flat semiumbilical surface in R4 , and let c be the\nsection of NM such that c * \u03b1 = g. Then,\n(1) There is a unique vector field j \u2208 X(M) such that for any X \u2208 X(M) we\nhave \u03b1(j, X) = \u2207\u22a5\nX c, and it is given by\n1\nb2 * Dt2 c\nb1 * Dt1 c\nj = grad(c * c) =\nt1 +\nt2 .\n2\nb1 * b1\nb2 * b2\n(2) Let f = id +c + Z : M \u2192 R4 , where Z \u2208 X(M) is parallel, and put U to\ndenote the open subset of M where j + Z neither vanishes nor is parallel\nto an asymptotic direction. Then, f is an immersion on U.\nProof. (1) If such a vector field j exists, then\n1\n1\nj * X = c * \u03b1(j, X) = c * \u2207\u22a5\nX c = c * DX c = DX (c * c) = d(c * c)(X)\n2\n2\n1\n= grad(c * c) * X.\n2\n8\n\n\fTherefore, if it exists, j is unique and is given by 12 grad(c * c). Its existence is not\nevident. We can write j = j 1 t1 + j 2 t2 and must have \u03b1(j, t1 ) = j 1 b1 = \u2207\u22a5\nt1 c. This\nreduces to the following two conditions\nb *D c\n\n(1) j 1 b1 * b1 = b1 * Dt1 c, that is j 1 = 1b1 *bt11 .\n(2) j 1 b1 * b2 = b2 * Dt1 c.\nCondition (1) determines j 1 . Since b1 *b2 = 0, condition (2) can be met iff b2 *Dt1 c =\n0, but this is true by 3.4. The same happens to j 2 , and this proves our claims.\nNote that we have found a vector field j \u2208 X(M) such that\n(DX (c \u2212 j))\u22a5 = 0, \u2200X \u2208 X(M).\n(2) Let p \u2208 M, 0 6= X \u2208 Tp M, and assume that df (X) = 0. Since df (X) \u2208\nNp M, this happens iff for any u \u2208 Np M we have u * df (X) = 0. But\nu * df (X) = u * (X + DX c + DX Z) = u * (DX (c + Z))\u22a5 = u * (DX (j + Z))\u22a5 .\nHence, df (X) = 0 iff (DX (j + Z))\u22a5 = 0. Now, if Z = Z 1 t1 + Z 2 t2 , we have\n(DX (j + Z))\u22a5 = ((j 1 + Z 1 )(DX t1 )\u22a5 + (j 2 + Z 2 )(DX t2 )\u22a5\n= (j 1 + Z 1 )X 1 b1 + (j 2 + Z 2 )X 2 b2 .\nSince b1 and b2 are linearly independent, this is zero iff j 1 + Z 1 = 0 or j 2 + Z 2 = 0\nbecause X 6= 0, and this proves our claim.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.2. Let M be a flat semiumbilical surface in R4 . Let c be the section\nof NM such that c * \u03b1 = g, let j = 21 grad(c * c) \u2208 X(M), and let Z \u2208 \u0393NM be\nparallel. If f : M \u2192 R4 is defined by f = id +t(c \u2212 j) + Z, with t \u2208 R, then\ndf (Tp M) \u2282 Tp M, \u2200p \u2208 M. Hence, if f is an immersion, the surface f (M) is flat\nand semiumbilical.\nProposition 5.3. Let M be a flat semiumbilical surface in R4 , e \u2208 X(M) be\nsuch that \u2207\u22a4\nX e = X, \u2200X \u2208 X(M), and let U \u2282 M be the open region where e\nneither vanishes nor is an asymptotic direction. Then f = id \u2212e is an immersion\nin U and if p0 \u2208 U, then there is a section k of NM in a neighborhood V of p0\nsuch that (DX (k \u2212 e))\u22a5 = 0 on V. Obviously, k is determined up to the addition\nof a parallel section of NM.\nProof. First, we know that df (Tp M) \u2282 Np M. Let (t1 , t2 ) be a local orthonormal\nbasis of Tp M of asymptotic directions. Let 0 6= X \u2208 Tp M. Then dfp (X) = 0 iff for\nany u \u2208 Np M we have 0 = u * dfp(X) = u * (X \u2212 DX e) = \u2212u * DX e = \u2212u * \u03b1(e, X),\nthat is iff \u03b1(e, X) = e1 X 1 b1 + e2 X 2 b2 = 0, where X i , ei are the components of X\nand e in the basis (t1 , t2 ) and bi have its usual meaning. Since (b1 , b2 )is linearly\nindependent, we conclude that e1 = 0 or e2 = 0, because X 6= 0. Therefore, e\nvanishes at p or determines an asymptotic direction.\nThe immersed surface f (U) is flat and semiumbilical, as we know already. Let\nV be an open subset of f (U) where there is \u1ebd \u2208 X(V ) such that \u2207\u22a4\nu \u1ebd = u, \u2200u \u2208\n\u22121\nX(V ). We put k = \u2212\u1ebd \u25e6 f \u2208 \u0393N\u03c6(V ), where \u03c6 = f . Then\n\u22a4\n\u22a5\nu = \u2207\u22a4\nu \u1ebd = \u2212(Du (k \u25e6 \u03c6)) = \u2212(Dd\u03c6(u) k) .\n\n9\n\n\fNow u = df (d\u03c6(u)) = (d\u03c6(u) \u2212 Dd\u03c6(u) e)\u22a5 = \u2212(Dd\u03c6(u) e)\u22a5 , and our claims follow.\n\u0003\nWe can combine both transformations:\nTheorem 5.4. Let M be a flat semiumbilical surface immersed in R4 and let\nZ \u2208 \u0393NM be parallel. If the map f : M \u2192 R4 is defined by f = id +t1 (e \u2212\nk) + t2 (c \u2212 j) + Z, with t1 , t2 \u2208 R, then df (Tp M) \u2282 Tp M, \u2200p \u2208 M, and if\nf : M \u2192 f (M) is a diffeomorphism, then f (M) is flat and semiumbilical.\nProof. Let u \u2208 Np M, X \u2208 Tp M. We will have\nu*df (X) = u * (X + t1 DX (e \u2212 k) + t2 DX (c \u2212 j) + DX Z)\n= u * ((t1 DX (e \u2212 k))\u22a5 + t2 (DX (c \u2212 j))\u22a5 + \u2207\u22a5\nX Z) = 0.\nNow f (M) is flat and with flat normal bundle as a consequence of 4.2. We\nneed still to prove that there are no inflection points in f (M). Let p \u2208 M, q =\nf (p), X, Y \u2208 X(M), u \u2208 \u0393NM. Then (u\u25e6\u03c6)* \u03b1\u0303(X \u25e6\u03c6, Y \u25e6\u03c6) = (u\u25e6\u03c6)*DX\u25e6\u03c6 (Y \u25e6\u03c6).\nThe evaluation of this at q gives\nup * \u03b1\u0303(Xp , Yp ) = up * DXp (Y \u25e6 \u03c6) = up * Dd\u03c6(Xp ) Y = up * \u03b1(d\u03c6(Xp ), Yp ).\nTherefore \u03b1\u0303(Xp , Yp ) = \u03b1(d\u03c6(Xp ), Yp ). The curvature ellipse at q lies in an affine\nline of Nq f (M). If q is an inflection point of f (M) (this includes the case that\nit be umbilic) then that line passes by the origin (the ellipse itself passes by it\nbecause f (M) is flat). Hence, the subspace \u03b1\u0303(Tq f (M) \u2297 Tq f (M)) \u2282 Nq f (M) is\none-dimensional. The same must be true for \u03b1, so that p would be an inflection\npoint, against our hypotheses. Hence, f (M) is semiumbilical.\n\u0003\nThis transformation is said to be of parallel type.\nNow, we exhibit a transformation that sends each tangent space to its orthogonal: this is another of our main results. Let us denote with the same letter,\ncrowned by a tilde, functions on f (M) that correspond to functions on M.\nTheorem 5.5. Let M be a flat semiumbilical surface in R4 . Let c be the section\nof NM such that c * \u03b1 = g, e \u2208 X(M) such that \u2207\u22a4\nX e = X, \u2200X \u2208 X(M), and\n4\nt \u2208 R. Put f = id +tc \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)e : M \u2192 R . Then df (Tp M) \u2282 Np M for any\np \u2208 M. If f is an immersion, then the surface f (M) is flat and semiumbilical,\nand if \u03c6 denotes a local inverse of f , we have\n(1) If Xp \u2208 Nf (p) f (M) = Tp M, up , vp \u2208 Tf (p) f (M) = Np M, then\nXp * \u03b1\u0303(up , vp ) = \u2212vp * \u03b1(Xp , d\u03c6(up)),\nXp * \u03b1\u0303(df (Yp), vp ) = \u2212vp * \u03b1(Xp , Yp ).\n(2) c\u0303 = ((1 \u2212 t)e \u2212 2t grad(c * c)) \u25e6 \u03c6 = ((1 \u2212 t)e \u2212 tj) \u25e6 \u03c6.\n(3) If t 6= 1, there is a section k \u2208 \u0393NM such that (DX (e \u2212 k))\u22a5 = 0. This\nsection is determined under the addition of a parallel section of NM. We\nhave \u1ebd = (tc \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)k) \u25e6 \u03c6.\n10\n\n\fProof. Let X, Y \u2208 Tp M. Then:\nX * df (Y ) = X * (Y + tdc(Y ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)de(Y ))\n= X * (Y + tDY c \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)DY e)\n= X * Y \u2212 tc * \u03b1(X, Y ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)X * \u2207\u22a4\nYe\n= X * Y (1 \u2212 t \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)) = 0,\nso that df (Tp M) \u2282 Np M, as claimed. If f is an immersion, then f (M) is flat and\nwith flat normal bundle. Now\n(1) Let u, v \u2208 \u0393(NM) and X \u2208 X(M). Then u \u25e6 \u03c6, v \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2208 X(f (M)) and\nX \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393(Nf (M)). Thus\n(X \u25e6 \u03c6) * \u03b1\u0303(u \u25e6 \u03c6, v \u25e6 \u03c6) = \u2212(v \u25e6 \u03c6) * Du\u25e6\u03c6 (X \u25e6 \u03c6) = \u2212(v \u25e6 \u03c6) * d(X \u25e6 \u03c6)(u \u25e6 \u03c6)\n= \u2212(v \u25e6 \u03c6) * Dd\u03c6\u25e6u\u25e6\u03c6 X = \u2212(v \u25e6 \u03c6) * \u03b1(X \u25e6 \u03c6, d\u03c6 \u25e6 u \u25e6 \u03c6)\nIf p \u2208 M y q = f (p), the value of the above expression at q reads\nXp * \u03b1\u0303(up , vp ) = \u2212vp * \u03b1(Xp , d\u03c6(up)),\nor also, putting up = df (Yp ):\nXp * \u03b1\u0303(df (Yp), vp ) = \u2212vp * \u03b1(Xp , Yp ).\nIf q \u2208 f (M) then the curvature ellipse at q lies in an affine line of Nq f (M).\nIf q is an inflection point of f (M) (this includes the case that it be umbilic)\nthen that line passes by the origin (the ellipse itself passes by it because f (M)\nis flat). Hence, \u03b1\u0303(df (Yp), vp ) lies in the vector line containing the ellipse for any\nYp , vp . If Xp is non zero and orthogonal to that line, then \u03b1(Xp , Yp ) = 0 for\nall Yp . If we choose an orthonormal basis (t1 , t2 ) of Tp M that determines the\nasymptotic directions at that point, and Xp = X 1 t1 + X 2 t2 , Yp = Y 1 t1 + Y 2 t2 ,\nthen \u03b1(Xp , Yp ) = X 1 Y 1 b1 + X 2 Y 2 b2 = 0. Since (b1 , b2 ) is linearly independent,\nwe have X 1 Y 1 = X 2 Y 2 = 0, and being Yp arbitrary we conclude Xp = 0, against\nour hypotheses. Hence, f (M) is semiumbilical.\n(2) By the above result, there is c\u0303 \u2208 \u0393Nf (M) such that c\u0303 * \u03b1\u0303 = g\u0303. Assume in\nthe above formula that Xp = c\u0303q . Then df (Yp) * vp = \u2212vp * \u03b1(c\u0303q , Yp ), that is\n\u03b1(c\u0303q , Yp ) = \u2212df (Yp ) = \u2212(Yp + tDYp c \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)DYp e)\u22a5\n= \u2212t\u2207\u22a5\nYp c + (1 \u2212 t)\u03b1(Yp , ep ),\nor also\n\u03b1(c\u0303q \u2212 (1 \u2212 t)ep , Yp ) = \u2212t\u2207\u22a5\nYp c = \u2212\u03b1(tj, Yp )\nby Proposition 5.1. So, c\u0303q = (1 \u2212 t)ep \u2212 tjp , that is\nc\u0303 = ((1 \u2212 t)e \u2212\n\nt\ngrad(c * c)) \u25e6 \u03c6 = ((1 \u2212 t)e \u2212 tj) \u25e6 \u03c6.\n2\n\n(3) Since f (M) is flat, there is \u1ebd \u2208 X(f (M)) such that \u2207\u22a4\nu \u1ebd = u for any\nu \u2208 X(f (M)). Let us define k \u2208 \u0393NM by means of (1 \u2212 t)k \u25e6 \u03c6 = tc \u25e6 \u03c6 \u2212 \u1ebd. Using\n11\n\n\fthe same technique we have on one hand:\n\u03b1(c\u0303q , Yp ) = \u2212df (Yp) = \u2212(Ddf (Yp ) \u1ebd)\u22a5 = \u2212(DYp (\u1ebd \u25e6 f ))\u22a5\n= \u2212t(DYp c)\u22a5 + (1 \u2212 t)(DYp k)\u22a5\nand on the other\n\u03b1(c\u0303q , Yp ) = \u2212t\u2207\u22a5\nYp c + (1 \u2212 t)\u03b1(Yp , ep ).\nThat is k satisfies\n(DYp k)\u22a5 \u2212 \u03b1(Yp , ep ) = (DYp (k \u2212 e))\u22a5 = 0,\nas desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nNow we will see that the composition of two transformations of orthogonal type\nis one of parallel type, as we could expect. Let f1 = id +t1 c \u2212 (1 \u2212 t1 )e : M \u2192 R4\nand assume that f1 is a diffeomorphism. Since then f (M) is flat and semiumbilical\nwe can transform it by f2 = idf1 (M ) +t2 c\u0303 \u2212 (1 \u2212 t2 )\u1ebd, for obtaining another flat\nand semiumbilical surface. We have, for p \u2208 M, q = f (p):\n(f2 \u25e6f1 )(p) = f2 (p + t1 cp \u2212 (1 \u2212 t1 )ep ) = p + t1 cp \u2212 (1 \u2212 t1 )ep + t2 c\u0303q \u2212 (1 \u2212 t2 )\u1ebdq\n= p + t1 cp \u2212 (1 \u2212 t1 )ep + t2 ((1 \u2212 t1 )ep \u2212 t1 jp ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 t2 )(t1 cp \u2212 (1 \u2212 t1 )kp )\n= p + t1 t2 (cp \u2212 jp ) \u2212 (1 \u2212 t1 )(1 \u2212 t2 )(ep \u2212 kp ) = (f1 \u25e6 f2 )(p),\nwhere the final equality must be taken modulo the addition of a parallel section\nof NM. We have arrived thus to a result similar to the Bianchi permutability\ntheorem for B\u00e4cklund transformations (see [1])\nReferences\n[1] Burstall F.E.
