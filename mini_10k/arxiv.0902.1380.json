The generalization to time scales of forward and backward differences in Z leads\nto delta and nabla derivatives, respectively. Based on these two types of derivatives, a\ncombined derivative, the so called diamond-\u03b1 derivative, was recently introduced by Sheng,\nFadag, Henderson, and Davis [14]. For \u03b1 = 1 the diamond-\u03b1 derivative reduces to the\ndelta-derivative while for \u03b1 = 0 we get the nabla-derivative. When one chooses the time\nscale to be the set of real numbers, then all such notions are equivalent and coincident\nwith the standard concept of derivative. For other time scales, the diamond-\u03b1 derivative\nis a linear convex combination of delta and nabla-derivatives and seems to be useful for\nsolving certain dynamic equations [12, 14]. Although the combined diamond-\u03b1 derivative\nhas no anti-derivative, and so it is not a dynamic derivative [12], it is still possible to define\na diamond-\u03b1 integral on time scales with many interesting properties [9, 15, 16].

Mozyrska and D. F. M. Torres\n\ndiamond-\u03b1 calculus is still in its infancy, and much remains to be done. Here we introduce\nthe diamond-\u03b1 exponential function from an appropriate diamond-\u03b1 eigenfunction.\nIt is known that eigenvalue problems of delta-differential operators play an important\nrole on time scales [2, 7]. We look to the diamond-\u03b1 derivative as a linear operator on\nthe linear space of differentiable functions in both delta and nabla senses. More precisely,\nwe investigate and compare the idea of eigenfunction on time scales for three kinds of\ndifferential operators on a space of functions. An eigenfunction of a linear operator L,\ndefined on some function space, is understood as any non-zero function f in that space for\nwhich there exists a function \u03bb such that L f = \u03bb f . The solution of such problems depends\non boundary conditions required for f . Typically, the exponential functions are defined on\ntime scales by means of a cylindrical mapping [5, 6]. An alternative but equivalent way,\nis to define them as the solution of an eigenvalue problem. A suitable (Ly)(*) gives the\nexponential function as the solution of a problem Ly = py, where p is a function, subject to\nappropriate boundary conditions.\n\n2 Preliminaries\nIn this section we give a short introduction, with basic definitions and necessary results to\nwhat follows, on three types of calculus on time scales: (i) the delta (\u2206), (ii) the nabla (\u2207),\nand (iii) the diamond-\u03b1 (\u2666\u03b1 ) calculus. For more information we refer the reader to [1, 5],\n[3, 5], and [11, 12, 13, 14], respectively.\nBy a time scale, denoted by T, we mean a nonempty closed subset of R. As the theory\nof time scales give a way to unify continuous and discrete analysis, the standard cases\nof time scales are T = R, T = Z, T = N or T = cZ, c > 0. In particular also the set\nQq = {\u2212qk , 0, qk , k \u2208 Z, q > 1} forms a time scale. The set of natural numbers is taken here\nwith zero: N = {0, 1, 2, . . .}. Let T\u2217 := T\\{min T, max T}. Then N\u2217 = {1, 2, . . .}, while for\nexample, cZ\u2217 = cZ.\nFor t \u2208 T, the forward jump operator \u03c3 and the graininess function \u03bc are defined by\n\u03c3(t) = inf{s \u2208 T : s > t} and \u03c3(sup T) = sup T if sup T < +\u221e; \u03bc(t) = \u03c3(t) \u2212 t. Moreover,\nwe define the backward operator \u03c1 by \u03c1(t) = sup{s \u2208 T : s < t} and \u03c1(inf T) = inf T if\ninf T > \u2212\u221e; \u03bd(t) = t \u2212 \u03c1(t). In the continuous-time case, i.e., when T = R, we have \u03c3(t) =\n\u03c1(t) = t and \u03bc(t) = \u03bd(t) = 0 for all t \u2208 R. In the discrete-time case, \u03c3(t) = t + 1, \u03c1(t) = t \u2212 1,\nand \u03bc(t) = \u03bd(t) = 1 for each t \u2208 T = Z. For the composition between a function f : T \u2192 R\nand functions \u03c3 : T \u2192 T and \u03c1 : T \u2192 T, we use the abbreviations f \u03c3 (t) = f (\u03c3(t)) and\nf \u03c1 (t) = f (\u03c1(t)). A point t is called left-scattered (right-scattered) if \u03c1(t) < t (\u03c3(t) > t). A\npoint t is called left-dense (right-dense) if \u03c1(t) = t (\u03c3(t) = t).\nThe set T\u03ba is defined by T\u03ba := T\\(\u03c1(sup T), sup T] if sup T < \u221e, and T\u03ba = T if sup T =\n\u221e; the set T\u03ba by T\u03ba := T\\[inf T, \u03c3(inf T)) if | inf T| < \u221e, and T\u03ba = T if inf T = \u2212\u221e. Moren \u0001\u03ba\nn+1\nover, T\u03ba := T\u03ba , T\u03ban+1 := (T\u03ban )\u03ba and T\u03ba\u03ba := T\u03ba \u2229 T\u03ba .\nFor a function f : T \u2192 R, we define the \u2206\u2013derivative of f at t \u2208 T\u03ba , denoted by f \u2206 (t), to\nbe the number, if it exists, with the property that for all \u03b5 > 0, exists a neighborhood U \u2282 T\nof t \u2208 T\u03ba such that for all s \u2208 U , | f \u03c3 (t) \u2212 f (s) \u2212 f \u2206 (t)(\u03c3(t) \u2212 s)| \u2264 \u03b5|\u03c3(t) \u2212 s|. Function f\nis said to be \u2206\u2013differentiable on T\u03ba provided f \u2206 (t) exists for all t \u2208 T\u03ba .\nThe \u2207\u2013derivative of f , denoted by f \u2207 (t), is defined in a similar way: it is the number,\n\n\fA Study of Diamond-alpha Dynamic Equations on Regular Time Scales\n\n3\n\nif it exists, such that for all \u03b5 > 0 there is a neighborhood V \u2282 T of t \u2208 T\u03ba such that for all\ns \u2208 V , | f \u03c1 (t)\u2212 f (s)\u2212 f \u2207 (t)(\u03c1(t)\u2212s)| \u2264 \u03b5|\u03c1(t)\u2212s|. Function f is said to be \u2207\u2013differentiable\non T\u03ba provided f \u2207 (t) exists for all t \u2208 T\u03ba .\nExample 2.1. The classical settings are obtained by choosing T = R or T = cZ, c > 0:\n1. Let T = R and f be differentiable. Then, f \u2206 (t) = f \u2207 (t) = f \u2032 (t) and f is \u2206 and \u2207\ndifferentiable if and only if it is differentiable in the ordinary sense.\n2. Let T = cZ. Then, both derivatives\nf \u2206 (t) =\n\nf (t + c) \u2212 f (t)\n,\nc\n\nf \u2207 (t) =\n\n1\n( f (t) \u2212 f (t \u2212 c))\nc\n\nalways exist, t \u2208 T.\nIt is possible to establish some relationships between \u2206 and \u2207 derivatives.\nTheorem 2.2. [5] (a) Assume that f : T \u2192 R is \u2206\u2013differentiable on T\u03ba . Then, f is \u2207\u2013\ndifferentiable at t and f \u2207 (t) = f \u2206 (\u03c1(t)) for all t \u2208 T\u03ba such that \u03c3(\u03c1(t)) = t. (b) Assume that\nf : T \u2192 R is \u2207\u2013differentiable on T\u03ba . Then, f is \u2206\u2013differentiable at t and f \u2206 (t) = f \u2207 (\u03c3(t))\nfor all t \u2208 T\u03ba such that \u03c1(\u03c3(t)) = t.\nA function f : T\u2192R is called rd-continuous provided it is continuous at right-dense\npoints in T and its left-sided limits exist (finite) at left-dense points in T. The class of real\nrd-continuous functions defined on a time scale T is denoted by Crd (T, R). If f \u2208 Crd (T, R),\nthen\nthere exists a function F(t) such that F \u2206 (t) = f (t). The \u2206\u2013integral is defined by\nRb\na f (t)\u2206t = F(b) \u2212 F(a).\nSimilarly, a function f : T\u2192R is called ld-continuous provided it is continuous at leftdense points in T and its right-sided limits exist (finite) at right-dense points in T. The\nclass of real ld-continuous functions defined on a time scale T is denoted by Cld (T, R). If\nf \u2208 CldR(T, R), then there exists a function G(t) such that G\u2207 (t) = f (t). In this case we\ndefine ab f (t)\u2207t = G(b) \u2212 G(a).\nDefinition 2.3. [12] Let T be a time scale, \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], \u03bcts = \u03c3(t) \u2212 s, \u03b7ts = \u03c1(t) \u2212 s, and\nf : T \u2192 R. The \u2666\u03b1 \u2013derivative of f at t is defined to be the value f \u2666\u03b1 (t), if it exists, such\nthat for all \u03b5 > 0 there is a neighborhood U \u2282 T of t such that for all s \u2208 U ,\n|\u03b1 [ f \u03c3 (t) \u2212 f (s)] \u03b7ts + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) [ f \u03c1 (t) \u2212 f (s)] \u03bcts \u2212 f \u2666\u03b1 (t)\u03bcts \u03b7ts | \u2264 \u03b5|\u03bcts \u03b7ts | .\nWe say that function f is \u2666\u03b1 \u2013differentiable on T\u03ba\u03ba , provided f \u2666\u03b1 (t) exists for all t \u2208 T\u03ba\u03ba .\nTheorem 2.4. [12] Let f : T \u2192 R be simultaneously \u2206 and \u2207 differentiable at t \u2208 T. Then,\nf is \u2666\u03b1 \u2013differentiable at t and f \u2666\u03b1 (t) = \u03b1 f \u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) f \u2207 (t), \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nRemark 2.5. If a given function is \u2206 and \u2207 differentiable at the point t, then the \u2666\u03b1 \u2013\nderivative at t is the convex combination of \u2206 and \u2207 derivatives. It reduces to the \u2206\u2013\nderivative for \u03b1 = 1 and to the \u2207\u2013derivative for \u03b1 = 0. The case \u03b1 = 0.5 has proved to be\nvery useful in applications [14, 12, 13, 11].\nWe use the following notation: Crl (T, R) := Crd (T, R) \u2229Cld (T, R).\n\n\f4\n\nD. Mozyrska and D. F. M.

Similarly, a\nfunction q : T \u2192 R is called \u03bd\u2013regressive provided 1 \u2212 \u03bd(t)q(t) 6= 0 for all t \u2208 T\u03ba . By R\u03bd\nwe denote the set of all \u03bd\u2013regressive and ld-continuous functions on T. We recall now\nsome notations about Hilger's complex plane [4, 5]. By Ch it is denoted the set of Hilger's\ncomplex numbers: C0 := C, Ch := {z \u2208 C : z 6= \u2212 1h } for h > 0; whereas by Rh we denote\nHilger's real axis: R0 := R, Rh := {z \u2208 Ch : z \u2208 R and z > \u2212 h1 } for h > 0. Let Zh be the\nstrip Zh := {z \u2208 C : \u2212 \u03c0h < Im(z) < \u03c0h }, h > 0. Then, one defines the cylinder and \u03bd\u2013cylinder\ntransformations as follows:\na) \u03beh : Ch \u2192 Zh by \u03beh (z) := h1 Log(1 + zh),\nb) \u03be\u0302h : Ch \u2192 Zh by \u03be\u0302h (z) := \u2212 h1 Log(1 \u2212 zh),\nwhere Log is the principal logarithm function [4, 5]. For h = 0, one has \u03be0 (z) = z and\n\u03be\u03020 (z) = z for all z \u2208 C.\nDefinition 3.1.\ni) Let p \u2208 R .

We\nmay be then tempted to define the \u2666\u03b1 \u2013exponential function by a simple combination of \u2206\nand \u2207 exponentials. We consider here two such functions: \u03b1 E p and \u03b1 e p , where p \u2208 R \u2229 R\u03bd\nand \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\nOur first combined-exponential is the most natural to be considered:\n\u03b1 E p (*,t0 )\n\n:= \u03b1e p (*,t0 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u00ea p (*,t0 ),\n\nt0 \u2208 T.\n\nExample 4.1. Consider the time scale T = Z and the constant function p(t) = 21 . Take\n\u0001t\nt0 = 0. Then, e p (t, 0) = 23 is the solution of the initial value problem y\u2206 (t) = 21 y(t),\ny(0) = 1. Moreover, \u00ea p (t, 0) = 2t is the unique solution of y\u2207 (t) = 21 y(t), y(0) = 1. It\n\u0001t\nfollows that \u03b1 E p (t, 0) = \u03b1 32 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)2t , t \u2208 Z.\n\nOur second combined-exponential \u03b1 e p also involves a convex combination, but of a\ndifferent nature. It is motivated by the definitions (3.1) and (3.2) of \u2206\u2013 and \u2207\u2013exponential\nfunctions:\n\u0012 Zt\n\u0013\nZ t\n\u03be\u03bc(\u03c4) (p(\u03c4))\u2206\u03c4 + (1 \u2212 \u03b1) \u03be\u0302\u03bd(\u03c4) (p(\u03c4))\u2207\u03c4 , t0 ,t \u2208 T.\n\u03b1 e p (t,t0 ) := exp \u03b1\nt0\n\nt0\n\nThe combined-exponential \u03b1 e p presents some desired properties:\n(i) \u03b1 e p (t,t0 ) = e\u03b1p (t,t0 )\u00ea1\u2212\u03b1\np (t,t0 );\n(ii) ln (\u03b1 e p (t,t0 )) = \u03b1e p (t,t0 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u00ea p (t,t0 );\n(iii) if p \u2208 R \u2229 R\u03bd , then the semigroup property \u03b1 e p (t, s)\u03b1 e p (s,t0 ) = \u03b1 e p (t,t0 ) holds.\nWhile both functions \u03b1 E p and \u03b1 e p generalize \u2206 and \u2207 exponentials, in the sense that\nwhen \u03b1 = 1 one gets the \u2206\u2013exponential, and when \u03b1 = 0 one gets the \u2207\u2013exponential, these\ncombined-exponentials can not be really called an exponential function. Indeed, they seem\nto fail the most important property of an exponential function: they are not a solution of an\nappropriate initial value problem.\n\n5 Regular Time Scales\nIn the recent paper [10], Theorem 2.2 is used in order to obtain formulas for the \u2666\u03b1 \u2013\nderivative of delta and nabla exponential functions. For that we need assumptions on functions \u03c1 and \u03c3. We begin by recalling the notion of regular time scale [8].\nDefinition 5.1. [8] A time scale T is said to be regular if the following two conditions are\nsatisfied simultaneously:\na) \u2200t \u2208 T, \u03c3(\u03c1(t)) = t;\nb) \u2200t \u2208 T, \u03c1(\u03c3(t)) = t.\n\n\f6\n\nD. Mozyrska and D. F. M. Torres\n\nRemark 5.2. If T is a regular time scale, then both operators \u03c1 and \u03c3 are invertible with\n\u03c3\u22121 = \u03c1 and \u03c1\u22121 = \u03c3.\nThe following statement holds:\nProposition 5.3. [8] A time scale T is regular if and only if the following two conditions\nare true:\na) The point inf T is right-dense and the point sup T is left-dense.\nb) Each point of T\u2217 is either two-sided dense or two-sided scattered.\nExamples of regular time scales include R, cZ (c > 0), qZ , Qq , and [\u2212\u03b5, 0] \u222a qZ with\n\u03b5 > 0; while T = [a, b] \u222a [c, d] is not regular.\n\nRemark 5.4. If T is a regular time scale, then T\u03ba\u03ba = T\u03ba = T\u03ba = T. Moreover, \u03c3(T) = \u03c1(T) =\nT.\nWe know from Proposition 5.3 that for regular time scales T each t \u2208 T\u2217 is either twosided scattered or two-sided dense. Next proposition gives direct formulas for the \u2666\u03b1 \u2013\nderivative of the exponential functions e p (*,t0 ) and \u00ea p (*,t0 ).\nProposition 5.5. [10] Let T be a regular time scale. Assume that t,t0 \u2208 T and p \u2208 R \u2229 R\u03bd .\nThen,\n\u0015\n\u0014\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)p\u03c1 (t)\n\u03b1\ne p (t,t0 ) ,\ne\u2666\n(t,t\n)\n=\n\u03b1p(t)\n+\n0\np\n1 + \u03bd(t)p\u03c1 (t)\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b1p\u03c3 (t)\n\u2666\u03b1\n\u00ea p (t,t0 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)p(t) +\n\u00ea p (t,t0 ) .\n1 \u2212 \u03bc(t)p\u03c3 (t)\n\nFrom Proposition 5.5 we can immediately conclude that function e p (*,t0 ) is a solution\n(1\u2212\u03b1)p\u03c1 (t)\nof the initial value problem y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = q(t)y(t), y(t0 ) = 1, where q(t) = \u03b1p(t) + 1+\u03bd(t)p\n\u03c1 (t) .\nHowever, as illustrated by the next example, in general that is not the unique solution.\nIndeed, for one eigenvalue there may correspond infinitely many eigenvectors.\nExample 5.6. Let T = cZ, c > 0, and consider the \u2666\u03b1 dynamic equation y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = 0, y(t0 ) =\n1, where \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Then, the constant function y1 (t) \u2261 1 is a solution of such initial value\n1\n,\nproblem. Further, it is easily seen that for a given \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) also y2 (t) = eq (t,t0 ), q = \u2212 \u03b1\u03bc\n\nis a solution:\n\n\u03b1\ny\u2666\n2 (t)\n\nq\u03c1\n1+q\u03c1 \u03bd\n\n=\n\n1\n(1\u2212\u03b1)c ,\n\nand\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\u03c1\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u2212\u03b1\n= \u03b1q + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n+\neq (t,t0 ) =\neq (t,t0 ) \u2261 0 .\n1 + q\u03c1 \u03bd\n\u03b1c (1 \u2212 \u03b1)c\n\u0012\n\nWe have also that y2 (t0 ) = eq (t0 ,t0 ) = 1. Moreover, each convex combination of y1 (t) and\ny2 (t) is also a solution of the equation y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = 0 with condition y(t0 ) = 1. For that, let\nus see that if w(t) = \u03b2y1 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)y2 (t) = \u03b2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)eq (t,t0 ), then w\u2666\u03b1 (t,t0 ) \u2261 0 and\nw(t0 ) = \u03b2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2) = 1. Thus, w(t) is also solution to the problem. To have uniqueness\nof solution, a second boundary or initial condition is needed. Additionally, we see that\n\u03b1\n6= 1. Hence, with the second condition y(\u03c1(t0 )) = 1, y(t) \u2261 1 is the\ne\u2212 1 (\u03c1(t0 ),t0 ) = \u03b1\u22121\n\u03b1c\nunique solution.\n\n\fA Study of Diamond-alpha Dynamic Equations on Regular Time Scales\n\n7\n\nExample 5.6 shows that if we want to have a unique solution for the problem y\u2666\u03b1 (t) =\nq(t)y(t), \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), then we need to consider two boundary conditions. Only in the cases\n\u03b1 = 1 and \u03b1 = 0 the second condition disappear. This will be further investigated in Section 6. Before that we introduce the idea of decomposition of a regular time scale into a set\nof time scales that we call atomic.\nDefinition 5.7. Let T be a regular time scale. Let I be a nonempty finite set of indices. We\nS\nsay that a set D = {Ti , i \u2208 I}, where T = i\u2208I Ti , forms an ordered finite partition of the\ntime scale T if the following holds:\n(i) for all i \u2208 I\\{max I} one has T\u2217i \u2229 T\u2217i+1 = 0/ and max Ti = min Ti+1 while min T1 =\nmin T, max Tmax I = max T;\n(ii) each Ti , i \u2208 I, is a regular time scale;\n(iii) for all t \u2208 T\u2217i , i \u2208 I, t is either two-sided scattered or two-sided dense.\n(iv) the set S = {si : si = Ti \u2229 Ti+1 , i = 1, . . . n \u2212 1} is such that for any \u03b5 > 0 we have\nat least one of the nonempty sets (si \u2212 \u03b5, si ) \u2229 T\u2217i or (si , si + \u03b5) \u2229 Ti+1 consisting of\ntwo-sided scattered points only.\nAn element Ti \u2208 D is called an atomic time scale. If D = {T}, then T is an atomic time\nscale. We call the set S = {si : si = Ti \u2229 Ti+1 , i = 1, . . . n \u2212 1} defined in point (iv) the set of\nswitching points in the partition D .\nRemark 5.8. A partition D of a regular time scale T can be finite or infinite. In the present\nstudy we restrict ourselves to regular time scales T with a finite partition. In the case of\ninfinite partitions, we would change the item (i) in Definition 5.7 to: for all i \u2208 I\\{max I}\none has T\u2217i \u2229 T\u2217i+1 = 0/ and max Ti = min Ti+1 .\nRemark 5.9. Any atomic time scale Ti in a decomposition of T does not admit a non-trivial\npartition: the only partition of an atomic time scale Ti is D = {Ti }.\nRemark 5.10. A regular time scale admits a unique partition into a set of atomic time scales\nbecause any two such partitions have the same set of switching points.\nExample 5.11. (a) If T = R\u2212 \u222a qZ , then T = T1 \u222a T2 with T1 := R\u2212 \u222a {0}, T2 := qZ .\nk\nk\n(b)\n\b Letk q \u2208 Z with q >\b1. Ifk T = Qq = {\u2212q , 0, q , k \u2208 Z}, then T = T1 \u222a T2 with T1 :=\n0, \u2212q , k \u2208 Z , T2 := 0, q , k \u2208 Z . (c) If T = Z, then T = T1 := Z.\n\nAny regular time scale admits a decomposition into a finite or infinite partition. In\nour present investigation we only consider regular time scales T with a finite partition.\nExample 5.12 shows a regular time scale with an infinite partition.\nExample 5.12. Let T = n\u2208N (T2n \u222a T2n+1 ), where T2n = [2n, 2n + 1] and T2n+1 = {2n +\n1 + 0.5p, 2n + 2 \u2212 0.5p, p \u2208 qZ\u2212 \u222a{0} }. Then T is a regular time scale with an infinite partition.\nS\n\n\f8\n\nD. Mozyrska and D. F. M. Torres\n\n6 Diamond-alpha Dynamic Equations\nWe consider linear equations with \u2666\u03b1 derivatives. Our investigations are based on the fact\nthat on a time scale of isolated points, a first order \u2666\u03b1 equation becomes a linear equation\nof second order when written in terms of \u2206 and \u2207 notions (cf. Examples 5.6 and 6.1). Thus,\nto have uniqueness, two boundary conditions have to be used. We introduce the idea with a\nsimple example: if T = Z and \u03b1 = 0.5, then the Fibonacci sequence is the unique solution\nto the boundary value problem y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = 0.5y(t), y(0) = 1, y(1) = 1.\nExample 6.1. Let T = N \u222a {0} and \u03b1 = 0.5. We have:\n\n2y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = y\u2206 (t) + y\u2207 (t) = y(t + 1) \u2212 y(t) + y(t) \u2212 y(t \u2212 1) = y(t + 1) \u2212 y(t \u2212 1).\n\nConsider the \u2666\u03b1 equation y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = 0.5y(t). Then, 2y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = y(t), that is, y(t + 1) \u2212 y(t \u2212\n1) = y(t) \u21d4 y(t + 1) = y(t \u2212 1) + y(t). To have a unique solution, we need two initial or\ntwo boundary conditions. Moreover, if we take y(0) = 1 and y(1) = 1, then the Fibonacci\nsequence is the unique solution to the boundary value problem y\u26660.5 (t) = 0.5y(t), y(0) = 1,\ny(1) = 1. For t \u2208 T, the solution is the Fibonacci sequence with the general formula\n\u221a !t+1\n\u221a !t+1\n1\n1+ 5\n1\u2212 5\n1\n\u2212\u221a\n.\ny(t) = \u221a\n2\n2\n5\n5\nDefinition 6.2. Let T be a time scale and I \u2286 T. A \u2666\u03b1 \u2013dynamic equation of the first order\non I is an equation of the form F(t, y(t), y\u2666\u03b1 (t)) = 0 where F : I \u00d7 R2 \u2192 R. If function F is\nlinear with respect to y(*) and y\u2666\u03b1 (*), then the \u2666\u03b1 \u2013dynamic equation is said to be linear.\nWe consider linear equations of the form y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = p(t)y(t) + f (t), where f and p are\ngiven functions on a certain regular time scale T. Under the assumptions of Theorem 2.2,\nwe can write that y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = \u03b1y\u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2207 (t) = \u03b1y\u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2206\u03c1 (t) or y\u2666\u03b1 (t) =\n\u03b1y\u2207\u03c3 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2206 (t). Then, y\u2666\u03b1 (t) = p(t)y(t) + f (t) can be rewritten, respectively, in\nthe following form: \u03b1y\u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2206\u03c1 (t) = p(t)y(t) + f (t) or \u03b1y\u2207\u03c3 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2207 (t) =\np(t)y(t) + f (t).\n\u2666\u03b1\n\u03b1\nDefinition 6.3.

We do the proof in three parts: first for \u03b1 = 0, then for \u03b1 = 1, and finally for any\n\u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1).\nLet \u03b1 = 0. Then, problem (6.1) has the form y\u2207 (t) = p(t)y(t) with one condition y(t0 ) =\ny0 only. On the other hand, problem (6.2) has the form (1 \u2212 p\u03c3 (s)\u03bc(s)) y\u2206 (s)\u2212 p\u03c3 (s)y(s) = 0\nwith the initial condition y(\u03c3(s0 )) = y0 . Denote \u03c3(s) by t. Then, the dynamic equation of\n\u2206\n(6.2) can be written\n\u001a as (1 \u2212 p(t)\u03bc(\u03c1(t))) y (\u03c1(t)) \u2212 p(t)y(\u03c1(t)) = 0. Because \u03bc(\u03c1(t)) =\n0,\nif \u03bd(t) = 0\n, and y\u2207 (t) = y\u2206 (\u03c1(t)), we get (6.2) in the\n\u03bd(t), \u03bd(t)y\u2207 (t) =\ny(t) \u2212 y(\u03c1(t)), if \u03bd(t) 6= 0\nform y\u2207 (t) = p(t)y(t), y(t0 ) = y0 .\nConsider now \u03b1 = 1. Then, problem (6.1) has the form y\u2206 (t) = p(t)y(t), y(t0 ) = y0 .\nWe transform the dynamic equation of (6.2) for cases \u03bc(s) = 0 and \u03bc(s) 6= 0 separately. For\n\u03bc(s) = 0 we get directly the form y\u2206 (s) = p(s)y(s), because then \u03c3(s) = s. For \u03bc(s) 6= 0\nwe have that \u03bc(s)y\u2206\u2206 (s) = y\u2206 (\u03c3(s)) \u2212 y\u2206 (s). In this\n\u0001 case the dynamic equation (6.2) can\nbe written as y\u2206 (\u03c3(s)) \u2212 p(\u03c3(s)) \u03bc(s)y\u2206 (s) \u2212 y(s) = 0. Letting t = \u03c3(s), we get y\u2206 (t) =\np(t)y(t). Moreover, we have also the initial condition y(t0 ) = y(\u03c3(s0 )) = y0 .\nLet \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1), and s = \u03c1(t). Since T is a regular time scale, then t = \u03c3(s) and y\u2666\u03b1 (t) =\n\u03b1y\u2206\u03c3 (s) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2207\u03c3 (s) = \u03b1y\u2206\u03c3 (s) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2206 (s). For \u03bc(s) = 0 we have also \u03bd(s) = 0,\nand we get the dynamic equation of problem (6.2) in the form y\u2206 (s) = p(s)y(s). In this\nsituation one has y\u2206 (s) = y\u2207 (s) = y\u2666\u03b1 (s) for all \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). Finally, let us consider points\ns \u2208 T which are scattered, i.e., \u03bc(s) 6= 0 and \u03bd(s) 6= 0, since we have a regular time scale.\nThen, \u03bc(s)y\u2206\u2206 (s) = y\u2206 (\u03c3(s)) \u2212 y\u2206 (s) = y\u2206 (t) \u2212 y\u2206 ((\u03c1(t)) = y\u2206 (t) \u2212 y\u2207 (t) and\u0001the dynamic\nequation (6.2) simplifies to \u03b1y\u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2207 (t) \u2212 p(t) \u03bd(t)y\u2207 (t) \u2212 y(\u03c1(t)) = 0. Thus,\ny\u2666\u03b1 (t) = p(t)y(t).\n\n\f10\n\nD. Mozyrska and D. F. M. Torres\n\nTheorem 6.9. Let T be an atomic regular time scale, t0 \u2208 T\u2217 , y0 be a given constant, and\np(*) \u2208 R \u2229 R\u03bd . Then, the two boundary value problems (6.1) and (6.2) have the same unique\nsolution for each \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1].\n\nProof. For \u03b1 = 0 the boundary value problem has the form y\u2207 = p(t)y(t), y(t0 ) = y0 , and\nthere exists a unique solution for this \u2207 initial value problem of first order for all t \u2208 T,\nbecause of \u03bd\u2013regressivity of p. Similarly, for \u03b1 = 1 the problem has the form y\u2206 = p(t)y(t),\ny(t0 ) = y0 , and there is a unique solution in t \u2208 T, because p \u2208 R . Assume now, up to\nthe end of the proof, that \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). We consider two cases: \u03bd(t) 6= 0 and \u03bd(t) = 0.\nAssume\nthat \u03bd(t)\u0003 6= 0. Then, \u03bc(s) 6= 0 and we can write the equation (6.2) in the form\n\u0002\n\u03b1 y\u2206\u03c3 (s) \u2212 y\u2206 (s) + y\u2206 (s) \u2212 p\u03c3 (s)y\u03c3 (s) = 0. Moreover, then \u03b1y\u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2206 (\u03c1(t)) \u2212\np(t)y(t) = 0 and \u03b1y\u2206 (t) + (1 \u2212 \u03b1)y\u2207 (t) \u2212 p(t)(t) = 0 is in the form of (6.1). In this case\nequation (6.2) can be written as\ny\u2206\u2206 (s) +\n\np\u03c3 (s)\n1 \u2212 p\u03c3 (s)\u03bc(s) \u2206\ny (s) \u2212\ny(s) = 0,\n\u03b1\u03bc(s)\n\u03b1\u03bc(s)\n1\u2212p\u03c3 (s)\u03bc(s)\n\u03b1\u03bc(s)\n= 1 \u2212 \u03b11 6=\n\nwhich is regressive, thus having a unique solution.

Finally,\n\nThen, for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1) one has 1 \u2212 \u03bc(s) p\u0303(s) + \u03bc2 (s)q\u0303(s)\ny\u2206 (t)\n\nconsider the case when \u03bd(t) = 0.

Then all points in T\u2217 are two-sided\nscattered or two-sided dense. Assume that T\u2217 consist of scattered points. In that case inf T\n\u03b1\ncan be right-dense and sup T left-dense. For t \u2208 T\u2217 we can rewrite L\u2666\np y(t) = 0 as a second\norder recurrence equation using a transition matrix.

The convergence of the product of matrices depends if Y (t) is defined\nor not, i.e., depends on the existence of a solution y(t) to (7.1).\nWhen we consider a regular time scale T, then we use its unique partition on atomic\ntime scales.
