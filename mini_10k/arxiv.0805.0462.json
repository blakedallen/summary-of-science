It is motivated\nby theories unifying gravity with other interactions as\nwell as many cosmological models which suggest a possibility for fundamental constants to very in space and\ntime. Hints that some fundamental constants might had\nslightly different values in distant past have been found\nin Big Bang nucleosynthesis, quasar absorption spectra\nand Oklo natural nuclear reactor (see, e.g reviews [1, 2]).\nHowever, most of publications report only constrains on\npossible variation of the fundamental constant. For example, strong limits on present-day time variation of the\nfine structure constant and lepton to hadron mass ratio\ncome from atomic clock experiments (see, e.g. [2, 3]).\nGood progress in the search for the manifestation of\nthe variation of the fine structure constant in quasar absorption spectra was achieved with a very sensitive manymultiplet (MM) method which was suggested in Ref. [4].\nThe analysis of the data from 143 absorption systems\nrevealed anomalies in atomic spectra which can be best\nexplained by assuming a slightly smaller value of the fine\nstructure constant about 10 billion years ago [5].\nThe MM method relies on atomic calculations to relate the variation of the frequencies of atomic transitions\nto the variation of the fine structure constant. Similar\ncalculations for the atomic transitions which are used or\nplaned to be used as atomic optical frequency standards\nalso allowed to extend this fast developing area of research to the study of the present-date time variation of\nthe fine structure and other constants.\nIt only makes sense to consider variation of dimensionless constants (see, e.g. [1]). Therefore, most of the\nresearch is focused on the study of either variation of the\nfine structure constant \u03b1 (\u03b1 = e2 /h\u0304c) or electron to proton mass ratio \u03bc = me /mp or some other fundamental\nmass ratio like, e.g.\nme,q /\u039bQCD where mq is the quark mass and \u039bQCD is\nthe quantum chromodynamics mass scale defined as a\nposition of Landau pole in the logarithm for the running\n\nstrong coupling constants. Models of the grand unification suggest that if fundamental constants vary than\nfundamental mass ratio varies faster that the fine structure constant and therefore it might be easier to detect\nit. Transitions sensitive to the variation of the mass ratio can be found in atomic microwave, molecular and\nnuclear spectra. Corresponding studies use quasar absorption spectra and laboratory measurements [2].\nFurther advance in sensitivity can be achieved if strong\nenhancement is found. The relative rate of frequency\nchange (\u03c9\u0307/\u03c9) due to change of the fundamental constants\nis usually inversely proportional to the energy interval between the two states h\u0304\u03c9. Therefore the relative enhancement is likely to be found for the pairs of almost degenerate long-living states of significantly different nature.\nDifferent nature of states is important to make sure that\nthey don't move with the same rate. Also, long lifetime is\nneeded for high accuracy of the frequency measurements.\nPairs of states which satisfy all these conditions can be\nfound in atomic, molecular and nuclear spectra.\nIn present paper we review the search for variation of\nthe fundamental constants focusing of the connections\nbetween measured values and the change of the fundamental constants, enhancement mechanisms and most\nrecent experimental results.\nII.\n\nOPTICAL ATOMIC SPECTRA\n\nThe use of optical atomic transitions in the search for\nvariation of the fine structure constant \u03b1 is based on the\nfact that the frequencies of these transitions depend differently on \u03b1 and one can compare the frequencies of\ndifferent transitions over long period of time. If \u03b1 is\nchanging the ratio of the frequencies would change too.\nIn atomic units \u03b1 = 1/c where c is speed of light.\nTherefore, \u03b1 = 0 correspond to a non-relativistic limit.\nLeading relativistic corrections are proportional to (Z\u03b1)2\nwhere Z is nuclear charge. Therefore, it is convenient to\npresent the dependence of atomic frequencies on the finestructure constant \u03b1 in the vicinity of its physical value\n\n\f2\n\u03b10 in the form\n\nB.\n\n\u03c9(x) = \u03c90 + qx,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c90 is the present laboratory value of the frequency\nand x = (\u03b1/\u03b10 )2 \u2212 1. The sensitivity coefficient q is to\nbe found from atomic calculations.\nNote that\nq=\n\nd\u03c9\ndx\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nx=0\n\nTo calculate this derivative numerically we use\n\u03c9(+\u03b4) \u2212 \u03c9(\u2212\u03b4)\n.\n(3)\n2\u03b4\nand vary the value of \u03b1 in the computer code.\nThe same formula (1) and similar atomic calculations\nare used for the analysis of quasar absorption spectra and\nfor laboratory experiments involving optical transitions.\nA review of the methods of atomic calculations and critical compilation of the results for the quasar absorption\nspectra are presented elsewhere [6]. Below we review the\nlatest results of the analysis and discuss the results of\ncalculations for the laboratory measurements.\nq\u2248\n\nA.\n\nComparison of quasar absorption spectra with\nlaboratory spectra\n\nThe analysis of the three independent samples of data\ncontaining 143 absorption systems spread over red shift\nrange 0.2 < z < 4.2 gives [5]\n\u03b4\u03b1\n= (\u22120.543 \u00b1 0.116) \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n(4)\n\u03b1\nIf one assumes the linear dependence of \u03b1 on time, the\nfit of the data gives\n\u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 = (6.40 \u00b1 1.35) \u00d7 10\u221216 /yr,\n\n(5)\n\nper year over time interval of about 12 billion years. A\nvery extensive search for possible systematic errors has\nshown that known systematic effects can not explain the\nresult [7].\nRecently our method and calculations [4, 8, 9, 10] were\nused by two other groups [11, 12, 13]. However, they have\nnot detected any variation of \u03b1. The results of [11] were\nquestioned in Refs. [14, 15]. Re-analysis of Ref. [11] data\nrevealed flawed parameter estimation methods. The authors of [14, 15] claim that the same spectral data fitted\n\u22125\nmore accurately give \u03b4\u03b1\n(instead\n\u03b1 = (\u22120.64 \u00b1 0.36) \u00d7 10\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\u22125\nof \u03b1 = (\u22120.06\u00b10.06)\u00d710 in Ref.[11]). However, even\nthis revised result may require further revision.\nNote that the results of [5] are based on the data from\nthe Keck telescope which is located in the Northern hemisphere (Hawaii). The results of [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] are\nbased on the data from the different telescope (VLT) located in the Southern hemisphere (Chile). Therefore,\nsome difference in the results may appear due to the spatial variation of \u03b1.\n\nOptical atomic clocks\n\nStudy of the atomic optical frequency standards is huge\nand fast developing area of research. The accuracy of the\nmeasurements of atomic transitions between the ground\nand a metastable excited state for some atoms are on\nthe level of 10\u221216 with good prospects for further improvements (see, e.g. [3]). This makes it possible to use\natomic frequency standards to study present-day time\nvariation of \u03b1 and other fundamental constants. This is\ndone by comparing frequencies of different atomic transition over long period of times. One has to know how\nthe frequencies depend of \u03b1 for the interpretation of the\nresults. We have performed relativistic many-body calculations [8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] similar to those used in\nthe analysis of the quasar absorption spectra to establish\nthis dependence. The results are summarized in Tables I\nand II. Calculated energies are included to illustrate the\naccuracy of the calculations. The q coefficients for optical clock transitions may be substantially larger than\nthose used in cosmic transitions since the clock transitions are often in heavy atoms (Hg II, Yb II, Yb III,\netc.) while cosmic spectra contain mostly lines of light\natoms (Z < 33). The relativistic effects are proportional\nto Z 2 \u03b12 .\nCombined analysis of the frequency shifts of optical\ntransitions in H [23], Yb+ [24], Hg+ [25] and Sr [26] as\nmeasured against Cs primary frequency standard gives\nthe following limit on the rate of time-change of \u03b1 and\n\u03bc = me /mp [26]\n\u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22123.3 \u00b1 3.0) \u00d7 10\u221216 /yr,\n\u03b4\u03bc/\u03bc = (1.6 \u00b1 1.7) \u00d7 10\u221215 /yr.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nIn a more recent work [27] in which optical frequencies\nof Al+ and Hg+ were compared over a year the variation\nof \u03b1 is limited by\n\u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 = (\u22121.6 \u00b1 2.3) \u00d7 10\u221217 /yr.\n\n(8)\n\nThe results for \u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 (6,8) disagree with the result (5)\nobtained from astrophysical observation. Note however,\nthat eq. (5) assumes the same rate of change over about\n10 billion years which doesn't need to be true.\nC.\n\nEnhanced relative effects of \u03b1 variation in atoms\n\nIt follows from eq.

For the most of \"atomic clock transitions\"\nfrom the ground state to excited metastable states we\nhave K < 1 (see Table I) which means no enhancement.

One should look for almost\ndegenerate states (small \u03c9) of sufficiently different nature (large \u2206q), e.g. states of different configurations.\nA unique example of this kind is dysprosium atom (see\nTable II). It has a pair of states of opposite parity\nwhich are separated by extremely small energy interval\n(\u223c 10\u22124 cm\u22121 ). Atomic calculations [18, 22] for these\nstates give values of the q coefficients which are large\nand have opposite signs. This means that the energies\nof the states move in opposite directions if \u03b1 is changing\nthus adding to the enhancement.\nAn experiment is currently underway at Berkeley to\nplace limits on \u03b1 variation using this transition [28, 29].\nThe current limit is \u03b1\u0307/\u03b1 = (\u22122.7\u00b12.6)\u00d710\u221215 yr\u22121 . Unfortunately, one of the levels has quite a large linewidth\nand this limits the accuracy.\nSimilar pairs of states with strong sensitivity to variation of \u03b1 can be found in holmium (see Table II) and\nother Rare-Earth atoms [21].\nAnother way to find large enhancement is to look for\nfine structure anomalies [20]. Here both states are of the\nsame configuration and even of the same fine structure\nmultiplet. However strong enhancement may exist due\nto configuration mixing with other states.\nIII.\n\nATOMIC MICROWAVE CLOCKS\n\nHyperfine microwave transitions may be used to search\nfor \u03b1-variation [30]. Karshenboim [31] has pointed out\nthat measurements of ratios of hyperfine structure intervals in different atoms are also sensitive to variations in nuclear magnetic moments. However, the magnetic moments are not the fundamental parameters and\ncan not be directly compared with any theory of the\nvariations. Atomic and nuclear calculations are needed\nfor the interpretation of the measurements. We have\nperformed both atomic calculations of \u03b1 dependence\n[8, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] and nuclear calculations of\nXq = mq /\u039bQCD dependence [32] (see also [33]) for all\nmicrowave transitions of current experimental interest\nincluding hyperfine transitions in 133 Cs, 87 Rb, 171 Yb+ ,\n199\nHg+ , 111 Cd, 129 Xe, 139 La, 1 H, 2 H and 3 He.\nThe dependence of the hyperfine transition frequencies\non the variation of \u03b1 and fundamental mass ratios can\nbe presented in the form [32]\n\u03b4(A/E)\n\u03b4V\n=\nA/E\nV\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03ba\nm\nm\nq\ne\nV = \u03b12+Krel\n,\n\u039bQCD\nmp\n\n(10)\n\nwhere A is the hyperfine structure constant, E =\nme e4 /h\u03042 is atomic unit of energy, mq is quark mass,\n\u039bQCD is the quantum chromodynamics mass scale, and\nKrel and \u03ba are sensitivity factors. Krel is the relativistic\nfactor. It is due to the fact that relativistic hfs depends\non \u03b1 stronger that just \u03b12 as it would be in the nonrelativistic limit. The \u03ba parameter consists of at least two\n\n\f4\nTABLE II: Experimental and theoretical energies and calculated relativistic energy shifts (q-coefficients, cm\u22121 ) for pairs of\nalmost degenerate states of Dy and Ho.\nZ Atom\nGround state\nExcited state\nConfiguration J\nConfiguration J\nExpt.[16]\n10\n2\n10\n66 Dy I\n4f 6s 8\n4f 5d6s 10\n4f 9 5d2 6s 10\n67 Ho I\n4f 11 6s2 15/2\n4f 10 5d6s2 11/2\n4f 11 5d6s 13/2\n4f 11 6s6p 13/2\n4f 11 5d6s 9/2\n\ncontributions, \u03ba = \u03ba\u03bc +\u03bahr , where \u03ba\u03bc is due to the dependence of the nuclear magnetic moments on the mass ratio,\nand \u03bahr is due to the dependence of the hfs constants on\nnuclear radius (hadron radius factor). The results of the\natomic many-body calculations for Krel [8] and nuclear\ncalculations for \u03ba\u03bc [32] and \u03bahr [34] are presented in Table III. One can use these numbers to put limits on the\nvariation of the fundamental constants which follow from\nthe measurements. For example, the frequency ratio Y of\nthe 282-nm 199 Hg+ optical clock transition to the ground\nstate hyperfine transition in 133 Cs was monitored to very\nhigh precision for over 6 years at NIST which lead to the\nfollowing limit on its variation [25]\n\u1e8e /Y = (0.37 \u00b1 0.39) \u00d7 10\u221215 yr\u22121 .\n\n(11)\n\nUsing numbers from Tables I and III one can get the\nfollowing dependence of this value on the fundamental\nconstants\n\u1e8e /Y = \u22126\u03b1\u0307/\u03b1 \u2212 \u03bc\u0307/\u03bc + 0.02\u1e8aq /Xq .\n\n(12)\n\nHere Xq = mq /\u039bQCD . For the \u03bc\u0307/\u03bc term we can use the\nquasar result of Ref. [35] (see section VI B for a detailed\ndiscussion)\n\u03bc\u0307/\u03bc = \u1e8ae /Xe = (1 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10\u221216 yr\u22121 ,\n\n(13)\n\nWhere Xe = me /\u039bQCD . A combination of this result\nand the atomic clock result (11) gives one of the best\nlimit on the variation of \u03b1:\n\u03b1\u0307/\u03b1 = (\u22128 \u00b1 8) \u00d7 10\u221217 yr\u22121 .\n\n(14)\n\nHere we neglected the small (\u223c 2%) contribution of\nXq . The combined result of Hg+ /Al+ , Yb+ /Cs+ and\nHg+ /Cs+ gives [24, 25, 27]\n\u03bc\u0307/\u03bc = \u1e8ae /Xe = (\u22120.19 \u00b1 0.41) \u00d7 10\u221215 yr\u22121 .\n\n(15)\n\nwhich does not contradicts to (13).\nIV. ENHANCED EFFECT OF VARIATION OF\nFUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS IN NUCLEAR\nSPECTRA (229 TH)\n\nThere is a very narrow level of 7.6 \u00b1 0.5 eV above the\nground state in the 229 Th nucleus [36]. The position of\n\nEnergy[cm\u22121 ] q [cm\u22121 ]\nTheor.\n19797.96 20077\n7952\n19797.96 19693 -25216\n20493.40 21763 -28200\n20493.77 20872\n7300\n22157.86 22599\n3000\n22157.88 22631\n8000\n\nthis level was determined from the energy differences of\nmany high-energy \u03b3-transitions to the ground and excited\nstates. The subtraction produces the large uncertainty in\nthe position of the 7.6 eV excited state. The width of this\nlevel is estimated to be about 10\u22124 Hz [37]. This would\nexplain why it is so hard to find the direct radiation in\nthis very weak transition. However, the search for the\ndirect radiation continues [38].\nThe 229 Th transition is very narrow and can be investigated with laser spectroscopy. This makes 229 Th a\npossible reference for an optical clock of very high accuracy, and opens a new possibility for a laboratory search\nfor the variation of the fundamental constants [39].\nAs it is shown in Ref. [40] there is an additional very\nimportant advantage. According to Ref. [40] the relative\neffects of variation of \u03b1 and mq /\u039bQCD are enhanced by\n5 orders of magnitude. This estimate has been confirmed\nby the recent calculation [41] and preliminary results of\nour new calculations. The accurate results of the calculations will be published soon. A rough estimate for the\nrelative variation of the 229 Th transition frequency is\n\u03b4\u03c9\n\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b4Xq\n)\n\u2248 105 (0.1\n+\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\nXq\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Xq = mq /\u039bQCD . Therefore, the Th experiment\nwould have the potential of improving the sensitivity to\ntemporal variation of the fundamental constants by many\norders of magnitude. Indeed, we obtain the following\nenergy shift in 7.6 eV 229 Th transition:\n\u03b4\u03c9 \u2248\n\n\u03b4Xq\nM eV\nXq\n\n(17)\n\nThis corresponds to the frequency shift \u03b4\u03bd \u2248 3 *\n1020 \u03b4Xq /Xq Hz. The width of this transition is 10\u22124 Hz\nso one may hope to get the sensitivity to the variation\nof Xq about 10\u221224 per year. This is 1010 times better\nthan the current atomic clock limit on the variation of\nXq , \u223c 10\u221214 per year.\nNote that there are other narrow low-energy levels in\nnuclei, e.g. 76 eV level in 235 U with the 26.6 minutes\nlifetime (see e.g.[39]). One may expect a similar enhancement there. Unfortunately, this level can not be\n\n\f5\nTABLE III: Sensitivity of the hyperfine transition frequencies to variation of \u03b1 (parameter Krel ) and to the quark mass/strong\ninteraction scale mq /\u039bQCD (parameter \u03ba = \u03ba\u03bc + \u03bahr ).

ENHANCEMENT OF VARIATION OF\nFUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS IN ATOMIC\nAND MOLECULAR COLLISIONS\n\nScattering length A, which can be measured in BoseEinstein condensate and Feshbach molecule experiments,\nis extremely sensitive to the variation of the electron-toproton mass ratio \u03bc = me /mp or Xe = me /\u039bQCD [42].\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4Xe\n\u03b4A\n,\n=K\n=K\nA\n\u03bc\nXe\n\n(18)\n\nwhere K is the enhancement factor.

Near a\nnarrow magnetic or an optical Feshbach resonance the\nenhancement factor K may be increased by many orders\nof magnitude.\n\nVI. ENHANCED RELATIVE EFFECT OF\nVARIATION OF FUNDAMENTAL CONSTANTS\nIN MOLECULAR SPECTRA\n\nA detailed discussion of the variation of fundamental\nconstants in molecular spectra can be found in recent\nreview [43]. Below we present several examples.\n\nA. Comparison of hydrogen hyperfine and\nmolecular rotational spectra in quasar data\n\nThe frequency of the hydrogenic hyperfine line is proportional to \u03b12 \u03bcgp atomic units, molecular rotational frequencies are proportional to \u03bc atomic units. The comparison places limit on the variation of the parameter\nF = \u03b12 gp [44]. Recently similar analysis was repeated\nby Murphy et al [45] using more accurate data for the\nsame object at z = 0.247 and for a more distant object\n\nat z = 0.6847, and the following limits were obtained:\n\u03b4F\n= (\u22122.0 \u00b1 4.4) \u00d7 10\u22126\nF\n\n(19)\n\n\u03b4F\n= (\u22121.6 \u00b1 5.4) \u00d7 10\u22126\nF\n\n(20)\n\nThe object at z = 0.6847 is associated with the gravitational lens toward quasar B0218+357 and corresponds to\nthe backward time \u223c 6.5 Gyr.\nB. Enhancement of variation of \u03bc in inversion\nspectrum of ammonia and limit from quasar data\n\nFew years ago van Veldhoven et al suggested to use\ndecelerated molecular beam of ND3 to search for the\nvariation of \u03bc in laboratory experiments [46]. Ammonia molecule has a pyramidal shape and the inversion\nfrequency depends on the exponentially small tunneling\nof three hydrogens (or deuteriums) through the potential barrier. Because of that, it is very sensitive to any\nchanges of the parameters of the system, particularly to\nthe reduced mass for this vibrational mode. This fact was\nused in [35] to place the best limit on the cosmological\nvariation of \u03bc.\nThe inversion vibrational mode of ammonia is described by a double well potential with first two vibrational levels lying below the barrier. Because of the\ntunneling, these two levels are split in inversion doublets. The lower doublet corresponds to the wavelength\n\u03bb \u2248 1.25 cm and is used in ammonia masers. Molecular rotation leads to the centrifugal distortion of the\npotential curve. Because of that, the inversion splitting\ndepends on the rotational angular momentum J and its\nprojection on the molecular symmetry axis K:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n0\n\u03c9inv (J, K) = \u03c9inv\n\u2212 c1 J(J + 1) \u2212 K 2 + c2 K 2 + * * * ,\n(21)\nwhere we omitted terms with higher powers of J and K.\n0\nNumerically, \u03c9inv\n\u2248 23.787 GHz, c1 \u2248 151.3 MHz, and\nc2 \u2248 59.7 MHz.\nIn addition to the rotational structure (21) the inversion spectrum includes much smaller hyperfine structure.\nFor the main nitrogen isotope 14 N, the hyperfine structure is dominated by the electric quadrupole interaction\n\n\f6\n(\u223c 1 MHz). Because of the dipole selection rule \u2206K = 0\nthe levels with J = K are metastable. In astrophysics\nthe lines with J = K are also narrower and stronger than\nothers, but the hyperfine structure for spectra with high\nredshifts is still not resolved. We obtained the following\nresults for NH3 [35] (in atomic units):\n0\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03c9inv\n\u2248 4.46\n.\n0\n\u03c9inv\n\u03bc\n\n(22)\n\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4c1,2\n= 5.1 .\nc1,2\n\u03bc\n\n(23)\n\nFor ND3 the inversion frequency is 15 times smaller and\nthis leads to a higher relative sensitivity of the inversion\nfrequency to \u03bc:\n0\n\u03b4\u03c9inv\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u2248 5.7\n.\n0\n\u03c9inv\n\u03bc\n\n(24)\n\n\u03b4c1,2\n\u03b4\u03bc\n= 6.2 .\nc1,2\n\u03bc\n\n(25)\n\n0\nWe see that the inversion frequency \u03c9inv\nand the rotational intervals \u03c9inv (J1 , K1 ) \u2212 \u03c9inv (J2 , K2 ) have different\ndependencies on the constant \u03bc. In principle, this allows\none to study time-variation of \u03bc by comparing different\nintervals in the inversion spectrum of ammonia. For example, if we compare the rotational interval to the inversion frequency, then Eqs. (22) and (23) give:\n0\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4{[\u03c9inv (J1 , K1 ) \u2212 \u03c9inv (J2 , K2 )]/\u03c9inv\n}\n= 0.6 .\n0\n[\u03c9inv (J1 , K1 ) \u2212 \u03c9inv (J2 , K2 )]/\u03c9inv\n\u03bc\n\n(26)\n\nThe relative effects are substantially larger if we compare\nthe inversion transitions with the transitions between the\nquadrupole and magnetic hyperfine components. However, in practice this method will not work because of the\nsmallness of the hyperfine structure compared to typical\nline widths in astrophysics.\nWe compared the inversion spectrum of NH3 with rotational spectra of other molecules, where\n\u03b4\u03c9rot\n\u03b4\u03bc\n=\n.\n\u03c9rot\n\u03bc\n\n(28)\n\nTaking into account that the redshift z \u2248 0.68 for the object B0218+357 corresponds to the backward time about\n6.5 Gyr and assuming linear time dependence, this limit\ntranslates into the most stringent present limit for the\nvariation rate \u03bc\u0307/\u03bc and Xe [35]:\n\u03bc\u0307/\u03bc = \u1e8ae /Xe = (1 \u00b1 3) \u00d7 10\u221216 yr\u22121 .\n\n(29)\n\nENHANCED EFFECTS IN DIATOMIC\nMOLECULES\n\nIn transitions between very close narrow levels of different nature in diatomic molecules the relative effects\nof the variation may be enhanced by several orders of\nmagnitude. Such levels may occur due to cancellation\nbetween either hyperfine and rotational structures [51],\nor between the fine and vibrational structures of the electronic ground state [49]. The intervals between the levels\nare conveniently located in microwave frequency range\nand the level widths are very small, typically \u223c 10\u22122 Hz.\nA.\n\nMolecules with cancellation between hyperfine\nstructure and rotational intervals\n\nConsider diatomic molecules with unpaired electron\nand ground state 2 \u03a3. It can be, for example, LaS, LaO,\nLuS, LuO, YbF, etc. [50]. For a hyperfine interval \u2206hfs\nwe have\n\u2206hfs \u221d \u03b12 ZFrel (\u03b1Z)\u03bcgnuc ,\nwhere Frel is additional relativistic (Casimir) factor. Rotational interval \u2206rot \u223c \u03bc is roughly independent on \u03b1.\nIf we find molecule with \u2206hfs \u2248 \u2206rot the splitting \u03c9 between hyperfine and rotational levels will depend on the\nfollowing combination\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c9 \u223c \u03b12 Frel (\u03b1Z) gnuc \u2212 const .\n(30)\nRelative variation is then given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b4gnuc\n\u2206hfs\n\u03b4\u03c9\n(2 + K)\n,\n\u2248\n+\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\ngnuc\n\n(31)\n\nwhere factor K comes from variation of Frel (\u03b1Z), and for\nZ \u223c 50, K \u2248 1. Using data from [50] one can find that\n\u03c9 = (0.002 \u00b1 0.01) cm\u22121 for 139 La32 S [51]. Note that for\n\u03c9 = 0.002 cm\u22121 the relative frequency shift is:\n\u03b4\u03c9\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\u2248 600\n.\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\n\n(27)\n\nHigh precision data on the redshifts of NH3 inversion\nlines exist for already mentioned object B0218+357 at\nz \u2248 0.6847 [47]. Comparing them with the redshifts of\nrotational lines of CO, HCO+ , and HCN molecules from\nRef. [48] one can get the following limit:\n\u03b4Xe\n\u03b4\u03bc\n= (\u22120.6 \u00b1 1.9) \u00d7 10\u22126 .\n=\n\u03bc\nXe\n\nVII.\n\nB.\n\n(32)\n\nMolecules with cancellation between fine\nstructure and vibrational intervals\n\nThe fine structure interval \u03c9f rapidly grows with nuclear charge Z:\n\u03c9f \u223c Z 2 \u03b12 ,\n\n(33)\n\nThe vibration energy quantum decreases with the atomic\nmass:\n\u03c9vib \u223c Mr\u22121/2 \u03bc1/2 ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the reduced mass for the molecular vibration is\nMr mp . Therefore, we obtain equation Z = Z(Mr , v)\n\n\f7\nfor the lines on the plane Z, Mr , where we can expect\napproximate cancellation between the fine structure and\nvibrational intervals:\n\u03c9 = \u03c9f \u2212 v \u03c9vib \u2248 0 ,\n\nv = 1, 2, ...\n\n(35)\n\nUsing Eqs. (33\u201335) it is easy to find dependence of the\ntransition frequency on the fundamental constants:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b4\u03b1 v\n\u03b4\u03b1 1 \u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03bc\n1\n\u03b4\u03c9\n2\u03c9f\n\u2248K 2\n,\n=\n+ \u03c9vib\n+\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u03b1\n2\n\u03bc\n\u03b1\n2 \u03bc\n(36)\n\u03c9\nwhere the enhancement factor K = \u03c9f determines the\nrelative frequency shift for the given change of fundamental constants. Large values of factor K hint at potentially favorable cases for making experiment, because\nit is usually preferable to have larger relative shifts. However, there is no strict rule that larger K is always better.\nIn some cases, such as very close levels, this factor may\nbecome irrelevant. Thus, it is also important to consider\nthe absolute values of the shifts and compare them to the\nlinewidths of the corresponding transitions.\nBecause the number of molecules is finite we can\nnot have \u03c9 = 0 exactly. However, a large number of\nmolecules have \u03c9/\u03c9f \u226a 1 and |K| \u226b 1. Moreover, an\nadditional \"fine tuning\" may be achieved by selection of\nisotopes and rotational, \u03a9-doublet, and hyperfine components. Therefore, we have two large manifolds, the first\none is build on the electron fine structure excited state\nand the second one is build on the vibrational excited\nstate. If these manifolds overlap one may select two or\nmore transitions with different signs of \u03c9. In this case expected sign of the |\u03c9|-variation must be different (since\nthe variation \u03b4\u03c9 has the same sign) and one can eliminate some systematic effects. Such control of systematic\neffects was used in [28, 29] for transitions between close\nlevels in two dysprosium isotopes. The sign of energy difference between two levels belonging to different electron\nconfigurations was different in 163 Dy and 162 Dy.\nAmong the interesting molecules where the ground\nstate is split in two fine structure levels and (35) is approximately fulfilled, there are Cl+\n2 (enhancement K =\n1600), SiBr (K = 360), CuS (K = 24) and IrC (K =\n160). The list of molecules is not complete because of\nthe lack of data in [50]. The molecules Cl+\n2 and SiBr are\nparticularly interesting. For both of them the frequency\n\u03c9 defined by (35) is of the order of 1 cm\u22121 and comparable to the rotational constant B. That means that \u03c9 can\nbe reduced further by the proper choice of isotopes, rotational quantum number J and hyperfine components,\nso we can expect K \u223c 103 \u2212 105 . New dedicated measurements are needed to determined exact values of the\ntransition frequencies and find the best transitions. However, it is easy to find necessary accuracy of the frequency\nshift measurements. According to (36) the expected frequency shift is\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b4\u03b1 1 \u03b4\u03bc\n(37)\n+\n\u03b4\u03c9 = 2\u03c9f\n\u03b1\n4 \u03bc\n\nAssuming \u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 \u223c 10\u221215 and \u03c9f \u223c 500 cm\u22121 , we obtain\n\u03b4\u03c9 \u223c 10\u221212 cm\u22121 \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22122 Hz (in order to obtain similar sensitivity comparing hyperfine transition frequencies\nfor Cs and Rb one has to measure the shift \u223c 10\u22125 Hz).\nThis shift is larger than the natural width \u223c 10\u22122 Hz.\nC.\n\nMolecular ion HfF+\n\nThe ion HfF+ and other similar ions are considered\nby Cornell's group in JILA for the experiment to search\nfor the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron.\nRecent calculation by [52] suggests that the ground state\nof this ion is 1 \u03a3+ and the first excited state 3 \u22061 lies only\n1633 cm\u22121 higher. Calculated vibrational frequencies for\nthese two states are 790 and 746 cm\u22121 respectively. For\nthese parameters the vibrational level v = 3 of the ground\nstate is only 10 cm\u22121 apart from the v = 1 level of the\nstate 3 \u22061 . Thus, instead of (35) we now have:\n3 (1) 7 (0)\n\u03c9 = \u03c9el + \u03c9vib \u2212 \u03c9vib \u2248 0 ,\n2\n2\n\n(38)\n\nwhere superscripts 0 and 1 correspond to the ground and\nexcited electronic states. Electronic transition \u03c9el is not\na fine structure transition and (33) is not applicable. Instead, we can write:\n\u03c9el = \u03c9el,0 + qx ,\n\nx = \u03b12 /\u03b120 \u2212 1 .\n\nOur estimate is [49]\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n2q \u03b4\u03b1 \u03c9el \u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03b1\n\u03b4\u03c9\n\u2248\n+\n+ 80\n\u2248 2000\n,\n\u03c9\n\u03c9 \u03b1\n2\u03c9 \u03bc\n\u03b1\n\u03bc\n\u03b4\u03c9 \u2248 20000 cm\u22121 (\u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 + 0.04\u03b4\u03bc/\u03bc) .\n\n(39)\n\n(40)\n\n(41)\n\nAssuming \u03b4\u03b1/\u03b1 \u223c 10\u221215 we obtain \u03b4\u03c9 \u223c 0.6 Hz.
