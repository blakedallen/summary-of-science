It is clear that this entropy will not only depend on the type\nof dynamics, but also on the type of observations. Intuitively, one can expect that\nsome measurements are better suited than others to reveal information about the\ndynamics, whereas many will generate undesirable noise. In this paper, we show for\ntwo widely used model systems that the dynamical entropy is rather robust in this\nrespect. More precisely, general local positive operator-valued measurements may be\nrestricted to von Neumann type measurements for the shift on a quantum spin chain\nand gauge-invariant ones for the shift on a Fermion chain.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nClassical dynamical systems that admit a generating partition are, up to isomorphism,\nclassified by the value of their Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai invariant, see [8]. This is achieved\nby mapping the dynamical system on a shift dynamics on symbolic sequences written\nin an alphabet with sufficiently many letters. An isomorphism is obtained because\nthe encoding essentially maps a phase space point into a sequence. One cannot hope\nto extend this procedure to quantum dynamical systems as there is no underlying\nphase space. Already the shifts on quantum spin chains - the putative standard\nmodels for quantum dynamical systems in discrete time - show this difficulty: local\nobservables commute as soon as they are sufficiently pulled apart so that their domains\nof dependency become disjoint, while generally observables at largely separated times\nnever commute. Also two shifts on quantum spin chains with the same mean entropy\ndon't have to be isomorphic, even the type of the associated von Neumann algebra\ncan be different.\nIt is therefore not surprising that the Kolmogorov\u2013Sinai invariant extends in various\ndistinct ways to quantum dynamical systems, and different extensions feel different\nproperties of the system. The best-known extension is the CNT dynamical entropy\n(Connes\u2013Narnhofer\u2013Thirring), based on decompositions of the reference state, see [4].\nThis construction can be rephrased in terms of a coupling with a classical dynamical\n1\n\nE-mail: mark.fannes@fys.kuleuven.ac.be\nE-mail: bart.haegeman@fys.kuleuven.ac.be, Research Assistant FWO-Vlaanderen\n3\nE-mail: dimitri.vanpeteghem@fys.kuleuven.ac.be, Research Assistant FWO-Vlaanderen\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\fsystem, see [9]. A second approach, the ALF entropy (Alicki\u2013Lindblad\u2013Fannes), is\nbased on operational partitions of unity, see [1, 2]. It arises by alternating generalised\nmeasurements with the dynamics. The CNT entropy seems to encode rather the\ncommutative aspects of the dynamics while the ALF construction is more sensitive to\nnon-commutativity.\nModel systems are known for which these entropies yield very different results. Even\nsuch extremes as zero for CNT and infinity for ALF occur, viz. for free shifts, for\nPowers\u2013Price shifts [3] and for classical stochastic systems [7]. Even systems with a\nclearer physical input, such as shifts on spin chains and free evolutions on CAR algebras (canonical anti-commutation relations) produce different CNT and ALF entropies. For a shift on a chain with d-dimensional single site space, the expected\nclassical value, the entropy density \u03c3(\u03c9), is returned by CNT but in the case of ALF\nan extra term ln d shows up.\nWe shall in this paper investigate robustness properties of the ALF entropy. As mentioned above, the mathematical construction involves besides the dynamics a generalised measurement. However, there is a lot of freedom in choosing the corresponding\npartitions of unity and, in principle, repeated measurements can in themselves generate entropy. It is, in general, an open problem to decide what the impact is on the\nALF entropy.\nWe shall restrict here our attention to two basic models: the shifts on a spin on a\nFermion chain. For the spin chain, we shall show that instead of using generalised\nmeasurements as described by general partitions of unity and their corresponding\nPOVM's (positive operator-valued measures) it suffices to consider von Neumann\ntype measurements, i.e. projection-valued partitions. The idea of modelling a quantum\ndynamical systems by its multi-time correlation functions associated with a projectionvalued measurement goes at least back to proposals by Feynman and Gell-Mann. For\nthe shift on the CAR chain, we shall show that we may restrict our attention to\npartitions in gauge-invariant elements. Such elements correspond to second quantised\nobservables.\nWe conclude this introduction with a lemma that will prove useful in obtaining upper\nbounds for the entropy. Recall that a size-k operational partition of unity on a Hilbert\nspace H is a collection X = {xi | i = 1, 2, . . . , k} of operators on H such that\nk\nX\n\nx\u2217i xi = 1.\n\n(1)\n\ni=1\n\nThis definition straightforwardly generalises to a unital algebra of operators. Let,\nmoreover, \u03c9 be a density matrix on H. We can then introduce the k-dimensional\ncorrelation matrix \u03c1X with (i, j)-th entry\n\u03c1X (i, j) := Tr(\u03c9 x\u2217j xi ),\n\ni, j = 1, 2, . . . k.\n\nObviously, \u03c1X is a density matrix. We finally need the von Neumann entropy of a\ndensity matrix \u03c3\nS(\u03c3) := \u2212 Tr \u03c3 ln \u03c3.\n2\n\n\fLemma Let \u03c9 be a density matrix on a finite dimensional Hilbert space H and let\nX be a size-k partition of unity on H. Then\nS(\u03c1X ) \u2264 S(\u03c9) + ln dim(H).\nP\nDenote the spectral decomposition of \u03c9 by \u03c9 = i \u03bbi |\u03c6i ih\u03c6i | and consider the coupled\nP\nsystemPH \u2297 Ck . The vectors \u03b7i := kj=1 xj \u03c6i \u2297 ej form an orthonormal set so that the\nstate i \u03bbi |\u03b7i ih\u03b7i | on the extended system has the same entropy as \u03c9. The partial\ntrace of this density matrix on Ck equals \u03c1X while on H it has rank at most dim(H).\nApplying the triangle inequality for the entropy finishes the proof.\n\n2\n\nDynamical entropy\n\nIn this section, we briefly recall the construction of the quantum dynamical entropy\nas defined in [1]. More details can be found in [2]. A quantum dynamical system is\ngiven by a triple (A, \u0398, \u03c9). A is called the algebra of observables, the automorphism\n\u0398 : A \u2192 A is the single step dynamical map and the state \u03c9 on A is the reference\nstate, invariant under \u0398.\nAs in the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai construction an initial partition X gets refined\nunder the dynamics. For two partitions X = {xi | i = 1, 2, . . . , k} and Y = {yj | j =\n1, 2, . . . , l}, we define the ordered composition of X and Y as X \u2228 Y := {xi yj | i =\n1, 2, . . . , k, j = 1, 2, . . . , l}. The evolution \u0398 of a partition X is \u0398(X ) := {\u0398(xi ) | i =\n1, 2, . . . , k}. This gives us the N-steps refinement of partition,\n(N )\n\nX\u0398\n\n:= \u0398N \u22121 (X ) \u2228 . . . \u2228 \u0398(X ) \u2228 X\n\n(2)\n\nwith j-th element\n(N )\n\nX\u0398 (j) = \u0398N \u22121 (xjN\u22121 ) * * * \u0398(xj1 )xj0 ,\n\nj = (j0 , j1 , . . . , jN \u22121 ).\n\n(3)\n\n(N )\n\nWith a refined partition X\u0398 and a state \u03c9 we now can associate the N-steps corre(N )\nlation matrix \u03c1X ,\u0398 . Explicitly,\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n(N )\n\n\u03c1X ,\u0398 (i, j) := \u03c9(X\u0398 (j)\u2217 X\u0398 (i)).\n\n(4)\n\nThe von Neumann entropy S of these refined density matrices is used to construct the\nentropy of a partition\nh(\u0398, \u03c9, X ) := lim sup\nN \u2192\u221e\n\n1\n(N )\nS(\u03c1X ,\u0398 ).\nN\n\nand the quantum dynamical entropy of the system (A, \u0398, \u03c9),\nh(\u0398, \u03c9) := sup h(\u0398, \u03c9, X )\nX\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fThe supremum over the possible partitions of unity X deserves special attention.\nThese partitions correspond to the measurements allowed to extract information from\nthe dynamics. The dynamical entropy therefore not only depends on the dynamical\nsystem (A, \u0398, \u03c9), but also on the class of allowed partitions.\n\n3\n\nShift on a spin chain\n\nAs a first example, we consider the shift on a quantum spin chain. In [1, 2], the\nentropy (5) was computed allowing arbitrary partitions in local elements. We prove\nthat we obtain the same result if we restrict our attention to partitions in orthogonal\nprojections, corresponding to the standard von Neumann type measurements.\nThe observables of a single spin form the algebra MdN\nof d \u00d7 d matrices. The spins in a\nfinite subvolume \u039b of Z are then described by A\u039b := \u039b Md . The natural embedding\nof A\u039b1 in A\u039b2 for \u039b1 \u2282 \u039b2 obtained by tensoring elements of A\u039b1 with the identity of\nA\u039b2 \\\u039b1 allows us to construct the algebra A of quasi-local observables of the quantum\nspin chain\n[\nO\nMd =\nA\u039b ,\nA :=\nZ\n\n\u039b\u2282Z\n\nwhere the bar denotes the norm closure. For n \u2208 Z, denote by \u0131n the canonical injection of Md in the n-th factor of A. The dynamical map \u0398 is the shift automorphism\non A, defined by \u0398(\u0131n (A)) = \u0131n+1 (A) with A \u2208 Md . The reference state \u03c9 is an\narbitrary translation invariant state on A, meaning that \u03c9 \u25e6 \u0398 = \u03c9.\n\nEntropy of the shift\nConsider now a partition X in local elements. Because of shift-invariance we can\nassume that they live on the interval [1, M]. The dynamics shifts these elements to\nthe right so that after N time steps, the refined partition lives on [1, M + N]. The\nalgebra A[1,M +N ] is just the algebra of dM +N dimensional matrices.

The algebra of observables A is now the algebra of canonical anticommutation relations (CAR). It is\nthe C*-algebra generated by the identity and elements {ak | k \u2208 Z} satisfying the\nrelations\nak al + al ak = 0\nand\na\u2217k al + al a\u2217k = \u03b4k,l 1.\nThe dynamical map \u0398 is the shift automorphism given by \u0398(ak ) = ak+1 and the\nreference state \u03c9 is the tracial state. It is uniquely determined by the condition\n\u03c9(AB) = \u03c9(BA) for A, B \u2208 A and explicitly given on ordered monomials by\n\u03c9(a\u2217k1 * * * a\u2217kn aln * * * al1 ) = 2\u2212n ,\n\nk 1 < * * * < k n , l1 < * * * < ln .\n\nAll other monomials have zero expectation.\nTo specify our restricted class of allowed partitions, we need the gauge-invariant subalgebra Agi . For a scalar \u03bb \u2208 T := {z | |z| = 1} define the so-called gauge-automorphism\n\u03b1\u03bb by \u03b1\u03bb (ak ) := \u03bbak . The GICAR algebra Agi is the subalgebra of A invariant under\nall the gauge-automorphisms,\nAgi := {A \u2208 A | \u03b1\u03bb (A) = A for all \u03bb \u2208 T}.\nAn element A := a\u2217k1 . . . a\u2217kn alm * * * al1 , is mapped into \u03b1\u03bb (A) = \u03bbn\u2212m A. It belongs to\nAgi if and only if m = n. In fact, Agi is spanned by such elements.\nThe algebra A is the abstract version of the algebra generated by e.g. Fermionic Fock\ncreation and annihilation operators. The one-particle space is l2 (Z) and ak = a(ek )\nwhere ek is the standard k-th basisvector in l2 (Z). The element ak is therefore the\nannihilation operator of the k-th mode in a chain of Fermionic modes. The elements of\nAgi are linear combinations of monomials that contain as many creation as annihilation\n6\n\n\foperators. Such elements conserve the number of particles. If we realise our abstract\nalgebra on the Fermionic Fock space, then the elements of Agi are second quantised\nlocal observables. The tracial state \u03c9 may be thought of as the most random state\non A, namely the infinite temperature state.\nUsing the Jordan-Wigner isomorphism we can map the CAR algebra onto a quantum\nspin chain. For our application it will suffice to consider a subalgebra of the CAR\nalgebra generated by {ak | k \u2265 1} and map this algebra on the one-sided chain\nN\nk\u22651 M2 . This isomorphism is constructed as follows.\n\nFor n \u2265 1, define\n\nVn :=\n\nn\u22121\nY\nk=1\n\nand\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nE11 := a\u2217n an\n\n(n)\n\nand E22 := an a\u2217n .\nN\nThe sub-algebra An generated by {ak | 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n} is isomorphic to nk=1 M2 with\nmatrix units\nn\nY\n[1,n]\n(k)\nE\u03c6\u03c8 :=\nE\u03c6k \u03c8k ,\n(7)\nE21 := Vn an ,\n\nE12 := Vn a\u2217n ,\n\n(2a\u2217k ak \u2212 1),\n\nk=1\n\nn\n\nwhere \u03c6 = (\u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n ) \u2208 {1, 2} and similarly for \u03c8. An\nNappropriate limit of this\nconstruction for n \u2192 \u221e leads to the quantum spin chain k\u22651 M2 .\n[1,n]\n\nThe action of the gauge-automorphism \u03b1\u03bb on the matrix units E\u03c6\u03c8 is\n[1,n]\n[1,n] \u0001\n\u03b1\u03bb E\u03c6\u03c8 = \u03bb\u03a3\u03c8\u2212\u03a3\u03c6 E\u03c6\u03c8 ,\nPn\nPn\nwhere \u03a3\u03c6 :=\nk=1 \u03c8k . The invariant elements are those for\nk=1 \u03c6k and \u03a3\u03c8 :=\nwhich \u03a3\u03c6 = \u03a3\u03c8.\nSums like \u03a3\u03c6 can take values n, n + 1, . . . , 2n. For each integer 0 \u2264 s \u2264 n,\no\nn\n[1,n]\nn\n\u03a3\u03c6 = \u03a3\u03c8 = n + s\nFs := span E\u03c6\u03c8\n\n[1,n]\n[1,n] \u0001\u2217\n[1,n]\n[1,n] [1,n]\nis a \u2217-algebra. Indeed, we have E\u03c6\u03c8\n= E\u03c8\u03c6 and E\u03c6\u03c8 E\u03c6\u2032 \u03c8\u2032 = \u03b4\u03c6\u2032 \u03c8E\u03c6\u03c8\u2032 and thus\n\u0001\n\u03a3\u03c6 = \u03a3\u03c8 \u2032 = n + s. Moreover, the sum \u03a3\u03c6 equals n + s for ns elements \u03c6 \u2208 {1, 2}n .\nTherefore, Fsn = M(n) . One also has that Fsn Ftn = 0 for s 6= t. This leads to the\ns\ndirect sum decomposition,\n\nAgi\nn\n\ngi\n\n:= A \u2229 An =\n\nn\nM\ns=0\n\nM(n) .\ns\n\nFinally, note that the effect of the shift \u0398 on an element (7) is not completely trivial.\nUsing the notation\nn\nY\n[m,n]\n(k)\nE\u03c6\u03c8 :=\nE\u03c6k \u03c8k ,\nk=m\n\n7\n\n\fwhere \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 {1, 2}n\u2212m+1 , one has\n\u0398(E\u03c6\u03c8 ) = (2a\u22171 a1 \u2212 1)\u03a3\u03c6\u2212\u03a3\u03c8E\u03c6\u03c8\n\n[2,n+1]\n\n[1,n]\n\n.\n\n[1,n]\n\n[1,n]\n\n[2,n+1]\n\nFor gauge-invariant elements E\u03c6\u03c8 , \u03a3\u03c6 = \u03a3\u03c8 and we simply get \u0398(E\u03c6\u03c8 ) = E\u03c6\u03c8\n\n.\n\nEntropy of the shift\nAn upper bound for the dynamical entropy can readily be obtained using the lemma\nat the end of the introduction. Fixing any local partition X , i.e. a partition whose\nelements belong to a local algebra An for n large enough, and recalling that the\nreference state is the tracial state, we obtain\nh(\u0398, \u03c9, X ) \u2264 2 ln 2.\n\n(8)\n\nIn the following, we will construct a gauge-invariant partition of unity which effectively\nrealizes this upperbound. This partition will have some nice properties which will\nallow us to map the system on a Markov process. This process itself will be simplified\neven further by a coarse graining of the state space. In the end, the entropy for this\nprocess will be calculated and by construction this will be the dynamical entropy for\nthe particular choice of gauge-invariant partition we made.\nConsider the set\n[1,M ]\n\n\b\n[1,M ]\nX := c\u03c6\u03c8E\u03c6\u03c8\n\n(\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2208 I0 ,\n\nwhere E\u03c6\u03c8 are matrix units in the CAR algebra, see (7), and where c\u03c6\u03c8 are complex\nnumbers to be determined later. The index set I0 \u2282 {1, 2}2M can be chosen arbitrarily respecting the following two conditions. First, we want only gauge-invariant\nelements in the partition, meaning that \u03a3\u03c6 = \u03a3\u03c8. Next, we impose that for every (\u03c61 ; \u03c81 , . . . \u03c8M ) there exists at most one (\u03c62 , . . . , \u03c6M ) for which (\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2208 I0 . In\nother words, the index set I0 is specified by a map (\u03c61 ; \u03c81 , . . . \u03c8M ) 7\u2192 (\u03c62 , . . . , \u03c6M )\nrespecting gauge-invariance.\nFor X to be a partition of unity, see (1), we have to ensure that\nX\nX\n[1,M ]\n[1,M ] \u0001\u2217 [1,M ]\n|c\u03c6\u03c8|2 E\u03c8\u03c8\nE\u03c6\u03c8 =\n|c\u03c6\u03c8|2 E\u03c6\u03c8\n1=\n(\u03c6,\u03c8)\u2208I0\n\n(\u03c6,\u03c8)\u2208I0\n\nand thus that,\nX\n\n\u03c6 : (\u03c6,\u03c8)\u2208I0\n\n|c\u03c6\u03c8|2 = 1 for all \u03c8 \u2208 {1, 2}M .\n\n(9)\n\nThe partition after N refinements will still consist of elements proportional to matrix\nunits, now living on N + M sites.

Due to the structure of the index set I0 ,\nthere is only one combination of elements of the initial partition X leading to a given\n(N )\nelement of the refined partition X\u0398 . We will denote the latter by\n(N )\n\nX\u0398\n\n\b\n[1,M +N ]\n= c\u03c6\u03c8 E\u03c6\u03c8\n\n(\u03c6, \u03c8) \u2208 IN .\n\nwith the new index set IN \u2282 {1, 2}2(M +N ) .\n\nThe corresponding correlation matrix is\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1\n1\n[1,M +N ]\n[1,M +N ] \u0001\u2217\n(N )\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n= N +M |c\u03c6\u03c8 |2 \u03b4\u03c6\u03c6\u2032 \u03b4\u03c8\u03c8\u2032 ,\nc\u03c6 \u03c8 E\u03c6\u2032 \u03c8\u2032\n\u03c1X ,\u0398 (\u03c6\u03c8, \u03c6 \u03c8 ) = N +M Tr c\u03c6\u03c8E\u03c6\u03c8\n2\n2\n\nand, as a given refinement can only be obtained in a single way, this correlation matrix\nis diagonal.\nThe problem has therefore been reduced to a dynamical entropy computation of a\nclassical dynamical system. The probabilities on the diagonal can be written as in (10)\n(N )\n\n\u03c1X ,\u0398 (\u03c6\u03c8, \u03c6\u03c8) =\n\n1\n2M +N\n\nc(\u03c61 ,t(1) )(\u03c81 ,...,\u03c8M )\n\n2\n\n2\n\nc(\u03c62 ,t(2) )(t(1) ,\u03c8M +1 ) * * *\n\nc(\u03c6N ,t(N) )(t(N\u22121) ,\u03c8M +N\u22121 )\n\n2\n\n2\n\nc(\u03c6N+1 ,...,\u03c6M +N )(t(N) ,\u03c8M +N ) .\n\n(11)\n\nBecause there is no summation over the t indices, these diagonal elements are path\nprobabilities of a Markov process. The states correspond to elements of the partition\nof unity, given by a pair (\u03c6, \u03c8) in I0 . A pair is determined by (\u03c61 ; \u03c81 , . . . \u03c8M ) and,\nmoreover, if \u03c8 = (1, 1, . . . , 1) or \u03c8 = (2, 2, . . . , 2), then only one \u03c6 can occur. The\nnumber of states is thus 2M +1 \u2212 2. A transition from state (\u03c6, \u03c8) to state (\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c8 \u2032 ) is\nallowed only if the indices \u03c6 and \u03c8 \u2032 match, i.e.,\n\u2032\n(\u03c62 , . . . , \u03c6M ) = (\u03c81\u2032 , . . . , \u03c8M\n\u22121 ).\n\n(12)\n\u0001\nAs can be read off from (11), the transition probability from the state (\u03c6n , t(n) ), \u03c8\n\u0001\n1\n\u2032\n|2 and the initial measure assigns the weight\nto \u03c6\u2032 , (t(n) , \u03c8n+M\n\u2032\n\u22121 ) is 2 |c\u03c6\u2032 (t(n) ,\u03c8n+M\n\u22121 )\n2\u2212M |c\u03c6\u03c8|2 to (\u03c6, \u03c8). Equation (9) ensures that these objects indeed correspond to a\ntransition matrix and a probability measure.\nWe simplify notation and denote the set of states by A, the transition probabilities\nby Pab , a, b \u2208 A, the initial measure by \u03bc and the measure after n time steps by \u03bcn .\n\n9\n\n\fThe entropy we are looking for is,\nX\n\u0001\n(N )\nS(\u03c1X ,\u0398 ) = \u2212\n\u03bc(a0 ) Pa0 a1 * * * PaN\u22121 aN ln \u03bc(a0 ) Pa0 a1 * * * PaN\u22121 aN\na0 ,a1 ,...,aN\n\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n\nX\n\na0 ,a1 ,...,aN\u22121\n\naN\u22121 aN\n\n= ***\n=\u2212\n\nX\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bc(a0 ) Pa0 a1 * * * PaN\u22122 aN\u22121 ln \u03bc(a0 ) Pa0 a1 * * * PaN\u22122 aN\u22121\n\n\u03bcN \u22121 (aN \u22121 ) PaN\u22121 aN ln PaN\u22121 aN\n\nX\n\n\u03bcn (a)\n\nn=0 a\u2208A\n\nX\n\nPab ln Pab .\n\n\u0001\n\n(13)\n\nb\u2208A\n\nWe have thus to calculate the quantity\n\nP\n\na\n\n\u03bd(a)\n\nP\n\nb\n\nPab ln Pab for a measure \u03bd.\n\nFrom a given state a there are only 3 or 4 possible states b to go to.

We obtain,\n\u2212\n\nX\na\u2208A\n\n\u03bd(a)\n\nX\nb\u2208A\n\n\u2212Pab ln Pab = \u03bd(A3 )\n\n3\nln 2 + \u03bd(A4 ) 2 ln 2.\n2\n\n(15)\n\nThe probabilities \u03bd(A3 ) and \u03bd(A4 ) will be computed by coarse-graining the set of\nstates A. For p, q \u2208 {1, 2} and s \u2208 {0, 1, . . . M}, define the sets\n\b\ns\nEpq\n:= ((p, \u03c6), (\u03c8, q)) \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 {1, 2}M \u22121, p + \u03a3\u03c6 = \u03a3\u03c8 + q = M + s .\n\nWe will consider these groups as the states of a new process. Note that there are only\n4M \u2212 2 of them, a number that should becompared with 2M +1 \u2212 2 previously. To\nshorten notation, we shall use {Ci \u2282 A} for the coarse-grained states, and {ai \u2208 A}\nfor the fine-grained states.\nNo matter how one chooses the map (\u03c61 ; \u03c81 , . . . \u03c8M ) 7\u2192 (\u03c62 , . . . , \u03c6M ), these two processes have a peculiar structure. Firstly, for given a1 and C2 , if there is a transition\npossible from a1 to a2 \u2208 C2 , then this a2 is unique. Moreover, with the choice (14)\nfor the coefficients c\u03c6\u03c8 , for given C1 and C2 , all allowed transitions from a1 \u2208 C1 to\na2 \u2208 C2 have the same probability. Therefore, it makes sense to write the transition\nprobabilities as PC1 C2 .\n10\n\n\fExplicitly, these transitions are given as follows: for s = 2, . . . , M \u2212 2, (s = 1, p = 1)\nand (s = M \u2212 1, p = 2)\ns\ns\nE11\n, E12\ns\ns\nE21\n, E22\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\ns+1\ns+1\ns\ns\nE11\n, E21\n, E12\n, E22\ns\u22121\ns\u22121\ns\ns\nE11\n, E21\n, E12\n, E22\n.\n\n(16)\n\nThese states have 4 possible transitions, i.e. they constitute the set A4 . For other\ncombinations (s, p)\n0\n1\n1\nE11\n, E21\n, E22\nM \u22121\nM \u22121\nM\nE22\n, E11\n, E21\n\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\n0\n1\n1\nE11\n, E12\n, E22\nM \u22121\nM \u22121\nM\nE22\n, E11\n, E21\n.\n\n(17)\n\nThese states have 3 possible transitions and constitute A3 .\n\nThe special structure of the considered processes has two important consequences.\nFirstly, the coarse-grained process is still Markovian. Indeed, the probability for a\ncoarse-grained path is\nX\nX X\n\u03bc(a1 ) Pa1 a2 Pa2 a3 * * * PaN\u22121 aN\n***\nP (C1 C2 . . . CN ) =\naN \u2208CN\n\na1 \u2208C1 a2 \u2208C2\n\n=\n\nX X\n\na1 \u2208C1 a2 \u2208C2\n\n***\n\nX\n\naN\u22121 \u2208CN\u22121\n\n\u03bc(a1 ) Pa1 a2 * * * PaN\u22122 aN\u22121 PCN\u22121 CN\n\n= ***\nX\n\u03bc(a1 ) PC1 C2 * * * PCN\u22121 CN\n=\na1 \u2208C1\n\n= \u03bc(C1 ) PC1 C2 * * * PCN\u22121 CN\n\nSecondly, the entropy formula (15) for the fine-grained and coarse-grained process\nleads to the same result. Indeed,\nX\nXX\nX\nX\nPC1 C2 ln PC1 C2\n\u03bd(a)\nPab ln Pab = \u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bd(a)\na\n\nC2\n\nC1 a\u2208C1\n\nb\n\n=\u2212\n\nX\n\n\u03bd(C1 )\n\nX\n\nPC1 C2 ln PC1 C2 .\n\nC2\n\nC1\n\nIn other words, there is no information loss due to the coarse-graining.\nInspecting the transition graph of the coarse-grained process (16\u201317), one can see that\nit is strongly connected. Therefore, the transition matrix is irreducible [6]. Moreover,\nthere is a strictly positive diagonal element, which implies that the transition matrix\nis primitive [6]. As a consequence, it has an unique invariant measure \u03bc\u221e and the\ninitial measure converges to it. Because we are only interested in the limit N \u2192 \u221e\nin (13), we can as well calculate this entropy using the invariant measure from the\nstart. Therefore\n1\n(N )\nh(\u0398, \u03c9) \u2265 lim\nS(\u03c1X ,\u0398 )\nN \u2192\u221e N\nX\nX\nPC1 C2 ln PC1 C2\n\u03bc\u221e (C1 )\n=\u2212\nC2\n\nC1\n\n= \u03bc\u221e (A3 )\n\n3\nln 2 + \u03bc\u221e (A4 ) 2 ln 2,\n2\n11\n\n(18)\n\n\fwhere we used (15) in the last line. Obtaining the values \u03bc\u221e (A3 ) and \u03bc\u221e (A4 ) finishes\nthe computation.\nThe invariant measure \u03bc\u221e can be easily calculated and equals\n(\n1\nif \u03c6 = \u03c8 = (1, 1, . . . , 1) or \u03c6 = \u03c8 = (2, 2, . . . , 2)\n\u03bc\u221e (\u03c6, \u03c8) = 2M\n1\notherwise.\n4M\nTherefore, \u03bc\u221e (A3 ) = 2/M and \u03bc\u221e (A4 ) = (M \u2212 2)/M. Substituting this in (18)\nh(\u0398, \u03c9) \u2265\n\nM \u22122\n1\u0001\n2 3\nln 2\nln 2 +\n2 ln 2 = 2 \u2212\nM 2\nM\nM\n\n(19)\n\nand this converges to 2 ln 2 when M goes to infinity. We have therefore saturated the\nupper bound (8).\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we studied the dependence of the ALF dynamical entropy on the class\nof allowed partitions. We considered two basic dynamical systems: the shift on a\nspin chain and the shift on a Fermionic chain. In these cases, the dynamical entropy\nseems to be robust for natural restrictions on the classes of allowed partitions. These\nmodel systems saturate, however, an upper bound following from simple dimensional\nestimates. It would be interesting to go beyond this situation and investigate examples\nwhere this is no longer the case.\nAcknowledgements: It is a pleasure to thank R. Alicki for useful discussions.
