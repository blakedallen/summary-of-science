The corresponding string field is a twisted squeezed state.\n\ntivation for our procedure.\nThe steps involved in the construction of N are as follows. First, note that N is to be determined as a set\nof constant expectation values satisfying the string-field\nequations of motion:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe physical behavior of strings can be investigated in\na variety of ways. Much of the existing lore is based on\nperturbative studies of single strings in relativistic quantum mechanics. However, it is likely that a satisfactory\nunderstanding of the subject requires also mastering nonperturbative and collective string behaviors.\nString field theory offers one framework within which\nto investigate nonperturbative many-body string phenomena. An essential feature of any field theory is the\nstructure of its vacuum, and it is of particular interest\nto establish the existence of any nonperturbative vacua.\nA relatively simple string field theory describes the open\nbosonic string [1], and for this case the existence of at\nleast one nonperturbative vacuum has been established\n[2\u20134]. The procedure involves a level-truncation scheme\nin which successive approximations to the full theory are\nmade according to the mass level of the particle fields\nand the terms in the action. Analytical methods at low\ntruncation orders and a combination of analytical and\nnumerical methods at higher orders can determine the\nstructure of the string field N for the nonperturbative\nvacuum in terms of expectation values of particle fields.\nThe nonperturbative vacuum N has been conjectured\nby Sen to be the end product of tachyon condensation\non a D25-brane [5]. Strong support in favor of this conjecture exists from explicit calculations using the leveltruncation scheme in the field theory for the open bosonic\nstring [6\u20138], with these now having reached level (10,20)\nin the notation of Ref. [4]. Analogous calculations for\nthe superstring provide further support for the idea that\nthe tachyon effective potential has a minimum where the\nD-brane tension is exactly cancelled [9\u201312].\nIn this work, we present an analytical approach to constructing the nonperturbative vacuum N . We obtain a\nseries representation for N and compare it to the numerical solution obtained via the truncation scheme. The\nmethodology and results offer several interesting possibilities for future exploration. In the remainder of this\nintroduction, we provide a brief summary of the steps\ninvolved in the construction of N , and we offer some mo-\n\nQN + g\u03b1\u2032 N \u22c6 N = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nThe requirement of spacetime independence of N makes\nit useful to transform the cubic vertex to a form in which\nthe oscillator zero modes are converted into the momentum representation, so that the momentum may be set\nto vanish. Once this form of the cubic vertex is obtained,\nwe search for a string field S obeying\nS \u22c6 S = c0 S,\n\n(2)\n\nwhich serves as the basic object upon which the solution is to be constructed. We next perform a Bogoliubov\ntransformation to a new oscillator basis for which S is the\nvacuum state. In this new basis, the string field N can\nbe expanded in particle-field modes and the conditions\ndetermining their constant values can be extracted from\nthe equations of motion (1). These conditions form a recursive set that is amenable to a formal solution for N .\nCertain features of the solution can be compared to those\nalready established via the level-truncation scheme, with\ngood agreement.\nThe above procedure may appear somewhat convoluted at first sight, so we provide some heuristic physical\nand mathematical motivation before detailing the calculations in the following sections. On the physical side,\none intuitively expects N to describe a situation in which\nthe whole string field has condensed to the vacuum. It\nis therefore plausible that an infinite number of particle fields acquire vacuum values in the nonperturbative\nvacuum N . In fact, it has been shown [13] that no nontrivial finite linear combination of expectation values for\nthe particle fields can satisfy Eq. (1). Intuition suggests\nthat the lighter modes should play a greater role in the\ndevelopment of the string-field condensate, so one might\nanticipate expectation values in N to drop with mass\nlevel. This is supported by evidence from numerical calculations with the level-truncation scheme. Furthermore,\n1\n\n\fphysical intuition about harmonic oscillators and the formation of a coherent condensate in the perturbative vacuum also suggests the natural form of the string field N\nis likely to be closely related to a generalized coherent\nor squeezed state [14]. These notions are echoed in our\nconstruction, since the solution we obtain for S in fact is\na squeezed state and the nonperturbative vacuum N is\ndeveloped by twisting S with oscillator factors controlled\nby the BRST operator Q.\nOn the mathematical side, we observe that the usual\ndescription in terms of perturbative oscillator modes and\nthe level-truncation scheme itself use a basis for the Fock\nspace in which Q is essentially diagonal and the star product has a complicated realization. However, the structure\nof the string field equations can be viewed as analogous to\na Riccati differential equation, involving a single derivative operator (basically, L0 \u03a8), a linear term (the factor\n\u2212\u03a8), and a quadratic term (the product \u03a8 \u22c6 \u03a8) [15]. In\nsuch equations the nonlinear term represents the greatest complication, and it is therefore natural to seek a\nrepresentation in which the star product has a relatively\nsimple structure. The ideal case would be to convert\nthe quadratic term to linear form. This can be approximated by finding a string state S satisfying Eq. (2) and\nconverting to a basis in which S is the basic (ground)\nstate, so that the star product has a relatively simple realization. The expression for Q\u03a8 becomes complicated\nin the new basis, so it might seem that little has been\ngained. However, the net effect of the manipulations is\nthat the difficulty has been moved from the nonlinear\npart of the equation to the linear part, which provides\njust enough advantage to make possible the construction\nV3 = exp(\u2212 21\n\nX X\n\nr,s m,n6=0\n\n\u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u2032rs s\u2020\nar\u2020\nm V mn an \u2212\n\ndp1 dp2 dp3 exp(\u2212 21\n\nX X\n\nr,s m,n6=0\n\nXX\n\nr,s n6=0\n\nof a solution.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In\nSec. II, some preliminaries are discussed, including the\nconversion of the oscillator zero modes to the momentum representation and some properties of coherent and\nsqueezed states. The reader uninterested in these details\nmay wish to pass directly to section III, in which the\nsqueezed string field S is obtained. Section IV converts\nto the squeezed-oscillator basis. The construction of the\nnonperturbative vacuum N is presented in Sec. V, along\nwith some of its properties. The results are discussed in\nSec. VI. Finally, Appendix A contains a derivation of a\nuseful identity. Throughout much of this work, the string\ncoupling g as defined in Ref. [2] and the string tension \u03b1\u2032\nare set to one, although they are explicitly displayed in\ncertain formulae for clarity.\n\nII. PRELIMINARIES\nA. Momentum representation\n\nThe equations of motion of the string field can be\nexpressed in terms of particle fields using a Fock-space\nrepresentation [16\u201318]. We are interested in spacetimeindependent solutions of these equations, so it is useful\nto express the spacetime dependence of the vertex in the\nmomentum representation rather than in the representation with oscillator zero modes. Following the approach\nof Ref. [16], we require the three-vertex V3 involving the\nvertex functions V \u2032rs\nmn to satisfy\n\n\u2032rs s\u2020\nar\u2020\n0 V 0n an \u2212\n\nrs s\u2020\nar\u2020\nm V mn an \u2212\n\nrs\nwhere the vertex functions Vmn\ndetermine V3 in the momentum representation of interest. As usual, the r, s\nsuperscripts are understood to take values modulo 3.\nRewriting the right-hand side using\n\n|pi = (2\u03c0)\u22121/4 exp[\u2212 41 p2 + a\u20200 p \u2212 12 (a\u20200 )2 ]|0i,\n\nXX\n\nr,s n6=0\n\n1\n2\n\nX\n\n\u2032rr r\u2020\nar\u2020\n0 V 00 a0 )|0i123\n\nr\n\ns\u2020\npr V rs\n0n an \u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nX\n\nr\npr V rr\n00 p )|0, pi123 ,\n\n(3)\n\nr\n\nNext, we use these relations to derive some properties of\nthe transformed vertex functions.\nFirst, we note that the 'double square' of the vertex\nfunctions V \u2032rs\nmn generates the identity [16]:\n\n(4)\n\nX\n\n\u2032ts\nrs\nV \u2032rt\nmk V kn = \u03b4 \u03b4mn ,\n\nm, n = 0, 1, . . .\n\n(6)\n\nk,t\n\nwe find the relations\nV\n\n\u2032rs\nmn\n\nV\n\n\u2032rs\n0n\n\nV\n\n\u2032rr\n00\n\n=\n\nrs\nVmn\n\nX V rt V ts\nm0 0n\n\u22122\n,\ntt\n2V\n00 + 1\nt\n\nrs\n2V0n\n,\n=\nrr\n2V00 + 1\n2V rr \u2212 1\n= 00\nrr + 1 .\n2V00\n\nThis leads to the following identities for the vertex functions in the momentum representation:\n\nm, n 6= 0,\n\nn 6= 0,\n\nXX\n\nrt\nts\nVmk\nVkn\n= \u03b4 rs \u03b4mn ,\n\nXX\n\nrt\nts\nrs\nVmk\nVk0\n= Vm0\n,\n\nk\u22651\n\n(5)\n\nk\u22651\n\n2\n\nm, n = 1, 2, . . . ,\n\nt\n\nt\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . ,\n\n\fXX\n\nrt ts\nrr rs\nV0k\nVk0 = 2V00\n\u03b4 .\n\nas before. These equations imply that the matrix\nV rr C = C V rr = 31 (1 + U C + CU ) commutes with all\nthe vertex-function matrices V rs , while C V rs = V sr C.\nThese identities are used below.\nThe above arguments establish that the vertex funcrs\ntions Vmn\nrestricted to n, m \u2265 1 have the same formal\nstructure as the original vertex functions V \u2032rs\nmn . This\nmeans that searches for spacetime-independent solutions\nto the equations of motion involve the same formal vertex structure as spacetime-dependent ones. We return to\nthis point in section VI.\nIn the remainder of this paper except where otherwise\nstated, the indices m, n range over 1, 2, . . ., so the results\nare independent of momentum. Thus, for example, the\nbosonic part of the three-vertex V3 takes the form:\n\n(7)\n\nt\n\nk\u22651\n\nIn particular, we see from the first of these relations that\nrs\nthe vertex function Vmn\n, for which m, n are restricted to\nnonzero level numbers, double-squares to the identity in\nanalogy with Eq. (6).\nNext, we establish some features of the structure of the\nrs\ntransformed vertex functions Vmn\n. Recall that the vertex\nfunctions V \u2032rs\nviewed\nas\nmatrices\ncan be expressed as\nmn\n[16]\nV \u2032rr = 13 (C + U \u2032 + \u016a \u2032 ),\nV \u2032r r+1 = 13 (C + \u03b1U \u2032 + \u03b1\u2217 \u016a \u2032 ),\nV \u2032r r+2 = 13 (C + \u03b1\u2217 U \u2032 + \u03b1\u016a \u2032 ),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = exp(2\u03c0i/3), Cmn \u2261 (\u22121)m \u03b4mn , and the matrices U \u2032 and \u016a \u2032 \u2261 C U \u2032 C satisfy\n(U \u2032 )2 = (\u016a \u2032 )2 = 1,\n\n(U \u2032 )\u2020 = U \u2032 .\n\n|V3b i\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nUmn = U\n\nmn\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n1\n2 )U m0 U 0n\n\n,\n\nh0| exp(\u03bba) exp(\u03bca\u2020 )|0i = exp(\u03bb\u03bc),\n\nm, n = 1, 2, ...,\n\nh0| exp( 12 a S a) exp( 21 a\u2020 V a\u2020 )|0i = (1 \u2212 S V )\u22121/2 .

It is convenient first to develop some machinery controlling the commutation of the various matrices on the\nright-hand side of Eq.

The solution T\u2212 behaves as\nX for small x, while T+ = 1/T\u2212 behaves as X \u22121 . A\nnumerical check on the eigenvalues of X = CV 11 shows\nthey are smaller than one and converge toward zero, with\nthe three largest being 0.21, 0.09, 0.03. Since the presence of any eigenvalue of T with absolute value greater\nthan or equal to one leads to an unnormalizable state,\nwe consider only the solution T\u2212 .\n\n(38)\n\nwhere X \u2261 CV 11 .

This solution\nis expected, and its appearance serves as a nice check on\nthe formalism. However, it is physically irrelevant because it is unnormalizable.\n\nwhich can be proved via the explicit expressions in terms\nof U and C. Note that the result in Eq. (36) involves\nonly T , C and V 11 .\nWe can use the result (36) in Eq. (27) to obtain an\nequation for T .

Starting with a general squeezed state defined\nby the matrix S\u0303 and requiring that its width be invariant\nunder the star product generates the condition\n\nvalidating the ansatz (33). The T = 1 solution gives\nS = C, and the corresponding string field is the identity\n5\n\n\f\u2212 C S\u0303C = ( \u1e7c 12 , \u1e7c 21 ) (1 \u2212 \u03a3\u0303\u1e7c )\u22121 \u03a3\u0303\n\n\u0012\n\n\u1e7c 21\n\u1e7c 12\n\n\u0013\n\n|Si = Det(1 \u2212 S 2 )1/4 Det(1 \u2212 S\u0303 2 )\u22121/2\n\n+ \u1e7c 11 ,\n\n\u00d7 exp( 12 a\u2020 Sa\u2020 ) exp(b\u2020 E S\u0303E \u22121 c\u2020 )|+i.\n\n(40)\n\nBy construction, it is an element of the star subalgebra of\nstring fields. A family of 'wedge' states also lying in this\nsubalgebra was recently introduced in Ref. [22]. It would\nbe interesting to determine explicitly the relationship of\nS to these wedge states.\n\nwhere\n\u03a3\u0303\n\nrs\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\nS\u0303\n0\n\n0\nS\u0303\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nNote the minus sign on the left-hand side of Eq. (40),\nappearing because conjugation using the two-vertex introduces a relative minus sign for the b and c oscillators.\nThe solution of Eq. (40) is completely analogous to the\nsolution of Eq. (27). This is because the matrices \u1e7c rs are\ndefined through matrices C and \u0168 as in the bosonic case,\nand so all identities leading to Eqs. (38) and (39) have\nghost-sector equivalents.\nWriting S\u0303 = C T\u0303 and X\u0303 = C \u1e7c 11 , one obtains\n(T\u0303 + 1)[T\u0303 2 + (X\u0303 \u22121 \u2212 3)T\u0303 + 1] = 0.\n\nIV. CONVERSION TO THE SQUEEZED BASIS\n\nSince the star product is idempotent on the string field\nS, one can expect the form of the vertex function to be\nsubstantially simplified in a new oscillator basis chosen\nsuch that the squeezed state |Si plays the role of the\nground state. As before, we begin our considerations in\nthe bosonic sector and subsequently extend them to the\nghosts.\nObserving that (a \u2212 Sa\u2020 ) exp( 21 a\u2020 Sa\u2020 )|0i = 0, we are\nmotivated to define a new annihilation operator s by the\nBogoliubov transformation\n\n(42)\n\nThis has solutions\nT\u0303 = \u22121,\n\nT\u0303\u00b1 =\n\n1\n2X\u0303\n\n(44)\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n3X\u0303 \u2212 1 \u00b1 (1 \u2212 X\u0303)(1 \u2212 5X\u0303) .\n(43)\n\ns = w(a \u2212 Sa\u2020 ),\n\nThe expected piece of the unnormalizable identity functional is again found as a solution, corresponding to\nT\u0303 = \u22121.\nThe two solutions T\u0303\u00b1 are real for all X\u0303 except for eigenvalues x\u0303 in the range 15 < x\u0303 < 1. For small x\u0303, T\u0303+ \u2248 \u2212X\u0303\nis small while T\u0303\u2212 \u2248 X\u0303 \u22121 is large. Since the eigenvalues of\n\u1e7c 11 converge toward zero, only T\u0303+ can lead to a normalizable solution to the ghost sector of Eq. (2). One might\nwonder whether some of the eigenvalues x\u0303 of X\u0303 lie in the\ninterval 15 < x\u0303 < 1, which would lead to complex eigenvalues for T\u0303+ . However, all the x\u0303 are negative, with the\nlargest three eigenvalues being \u22120.66, \u22120.25, and \u22120.08.\nCombining the above results provides the squeezed\nstate obeying Eq.

(60) through\n(62) in terms of the behavior of the left half (\"1\") and\nthe right half (\"2\") of the string. Thus, V\u0302 12 maps the\nright half onto the left half and annihilates the left half,\nwhile V\u0302 21 does the converse. The operators P1 and P2\nproject onto the left and right halves of the string, respectively. This interpretation is consistent with the identity\nV\u0302 12 + V\u0302 21 = C, since the operator C indeed interchanges\nthe left and right halves of the string. The existence of\nsuch an interpretation is to be expected because the action of the three-vertex is to map the left half of string r\nonto the right half of string r + 1 modulo 3. The Bogoliubov transformation to the s-oscillator basis apparently\ngenerates a structure reminiscent of the 'comma' representation proposed in Ref. [23]. It would be interesting\nto obtain explicitly the relation between the two formulations.\nTurning next to the ghost sector, we define new\nfermionic ghost oscillators t and u through the Bogoliubov transformations\n\nFor the transformed three-vertex V\u0302 , we find\nV\u0302 = O\u22121 (1 \u2212 VD S)\u22121 (VD \u2212 S)O,\n\n(55)\n\nwith the rr elements of the diagonalized form given by\n((1 \u2212 VD S)\u22121 (VD \u2212 S))11 = (1 \u2212 CS)\u22121 (C \u2212 S)\n= C,\n((1 \u2212 VD S)\u22121 (VD \u2212 S))22 = (1 \u2212 U S)\u22121 (U \u2212 S),\n((1 \u2212 VD S)\u22121 (VD \u2212 S))33 = (1 \u2212 \u016a S)\u22121 (\u016a \u2212 S).\n\n(56)\n\nThe diagonal elements of the transformed vertex function V\u0302 rs are all equal and given as one-third of the sum\nof its eigenvalues in Eqs.

THE NONPERTURBATIVE VACUUM N\nA. Construction\n\n(69)\n\nWe next consider the equations of motion for the string\nfield and construct a solution for the nonperturbative\nvacuum N .

Then, Eq. (73) reveals that L0 maps\nexcitation number m to excitation numbers m \u2212 2, m,\nand m + 2, while Eq. (75) shows that the star operator\nconnects excitation numbers m and n to a combination\nof excitation numbers m + n, m + n \u2212 2, . . ., |m \u2212 n|. The\nlatter is reminiscent of the combination of two angular\nmomenta. This is no accident, as we demonstrate next.\nIn the s-oscillator basis, the existence of the projection\noperators P1 and P2 separates the Greek indices into degrees of freedom pertaining to left and right halves of\nthe string. This split enables the realization of an SU(2)\nsymmetry associated with excitation number.

One solution is obtained by\nsetting to zero all terms with m 6= 0, yielding\n|N (0) i + |N (0) i \u22c6 |N (0) i = 0.\n\n(80)\n\nWe can use the analysis in section IV to set\n|N (0) i = |Si \u2261 |0is ,\n\n(81)\n\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 (0)\n\u03bb1 ...\u03bb4 (0)\nN20\n= N40\n= . . . = 0.\n\n(82)\n\nso that\n(0)\n\nN00 = 1,\n\n(76)\n\nThere may also be other possible choices producing different solutions to the string equations of motion. We\nreturn to this issue in the next section.\nAt order S 1 , one obtains\n(0)\n\n[(s\u2020 SE \u22122 s\u2020 )N00\nX\n\u03bb1 ...\u03bbm (1)\n+\n]|0is\n(ms\u2020 E \u22122 \u2212 s\u2020 )\u03bb1 s\u2020\u03bb2 . . . s\u2020\u03bbm Nm0\nm\n\n+ |N (1) i \u22c6 |N (0) i + |N (0) i \u22c6 |N (1) i = 0,\n\n(83)\n\nwhere the star product is understood to be expanded in\ncomponents at the appropriate order, according to Eq.\n(75). Note that the star product of |N (0) i = |0is with a\nterm in N (1) of excitation number m yields a result with\nthe same excitation number m. The presence of the first\n(inhomogeneous) term in Eq. (83) means that the only\nnonvanishing contribution at order S involves excitation\n(1)\nnumber 2. In particular, N00 = 0.\nThe explicit solution of Eq. (83) for |N (1) i yields\na somewhat cumbersome expression, involving left and\nright projection operators. However, the solution at order S simplifies greatly in the limit of high mass level,\nbecause the single term involving mE \u22122 dominates all\nterms other than the first. In this limit, we find\n\n(77)\n\nTwo nonzero states remain, one of excitation 0 and one\nof excitation 2.\nThe above discussion suggests it may be useful to distinguish even and odd excitation numbers. In particular,\nthe action of both L0 and the star operator are closed in\nthe subsector of even excitation number. In the remainder of this section, we restrict attention to this subsector.\nDespite the simplifications offered by the squeezed basis, obtaining an explicit exact solution to Eq. (72) remains a somewhat formidable task given the complexity of Eqs. (73) and (75). The approach we adopt here\nrelies on the observation that the matrix S appears in\nthe definition of L0 . Following the discussion in section\nIII, it can be shown that the eigenvalues of S are small.\nThe largest eigenvalues are approximately \u22120.21, 0.09,\nand \u22120.03, displaying an alternating series converging to\nzero. It is therefore a reasonable strategy to solve Eq.\n(72) perturbatively in S.\nWe expand the desired string field N as\n|N i = |N (0) i + |N (1) i + |N (2) i + . . . ,\n\n|0is\n\n+|N (0) i \u22c6 |N (0) i = 0.\n\nThese form the generators of the excitation su(2) algebra.\nNote that the J\u00b1 connect left and right oscillators. The\ntotal spin J = s\u2020 s/2 characterizes the representations.\nThis means that states of excitation number n constitute a representation of the excitation SU(2) symmetry\nwith spin J = n/2.\nIn general, the star product between states of excitation numbers m and n contains only min(m, n) + 1\nnonzero states of the mn possibilities, consisting of states\nof excitation |m \u2212 n| through m + n. As an example, Eq.\n(75) shows the star product of two J = 1/2 representa\u03bb \u2020\n\u03bb \u2020\ntions |f is \u2261 f10\ns\u03bb |0is and |gis \u2261 g10\ns\u03bb |0is is\n\u03bb \u03bc\n|f \u22c6 gi = f10\ng10 [(V\u0302 21 )\u03bb\u03bc + (P1 s\u2020 )\u03bb (P2 s\u2020 )\u03bc ]|0is .\n\n\u03bb ...\u03bbm (0)\n\n(ms\u2020 E \u22122 \u2212 s\u2020 )\u03bb1 s\u2020\u03bb2 . . . s\u2020\u03bbm Nm01\n\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 (1)\nN20\n\u2248 \u2212 21 S \u03bb1 \u03bb2 .\n\n(84)\n\nReconverting to the a-oscillator basis gives\n|N i \u2248 (1 \u2212 12 s\u2020 Ss\u2020 )|0is\n\n\u2248 (1 \u2212 12 a\u2020 Sa\u2020 )(1 + 21 a\u2020 Sa\u2020 )|0ia + O(S 2 )\n\n= |0ia + O(S 2 ).\n\n(78)\n\n(85)\n\nThis shows that at high mass levels the field S dominating the lowest-order solution is cancelled. This is consistent with the expected structure of the nonperturbative\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the order in S. Substitution in Eq. (72) at order S 0 gives\n9\n\n\fvacuum N , with low-mass levels taking values near the\nsqueezed field S and high-mass levels taking ones close\nto the usual vacuum.\nThe contributions to excitation number two arising\nfrom the last star-product term in Eq. (83) consist of\n\u03bb1 \u03bb2 (1)\nP2 projections on each index of N20\n. Similarly, the\npreceding term involves P1 projections. Moreover, the\ncontributions of unmixed projections in the term involving \u2212s\u2020 cancel, so the result (84) in fact holds exactly\nat order S for all mass-level contributions involving unmixed projections. Also, at order S the mixed projections are absent from the final two star-product terms.\nHowever, contributions from the \u2212s\u2020 term do arise for\nthe mixed projections. Schematically, one finds in this\n(1)\ncase that the result (84) for N20 becomes replaced by a\nstructure of the general form \u2212SE \u22122 /(2E \u22122 \u2212 1). For\nthe subleading mass level this produces a contribution\n\u2212S, thereby changing the sign of the term proportional\nto S in the lowest-order approximation. Since the true\nstate acquires a combination of contributions from mixed\nand unmixed projections, one again can anticipate an effect intermediate between S and the usual vacuum at\nthe lowest mass levels. We see that the nonperturbative\nvacuum N can be regarded as a twisted squeezed state,\nconstructed by the action of operators on the squeezed\nfield S and with net field values dropping more rapidly\nwith excitation number than an exponential at this order\nof approximation.\nThe order-S solution can now be used to advance to\n(2)\norder S 2 . A nonzero contribution to N40 arises at this\nlevel, along with corrections to the lower-order results.\nThis pattern continues at higher orders, with the first\ncontribution to N2N,0 being at order S N . It would be\ninteresting to determine whether a mechanism analogous\nto that described above causes higher-order expectation\nvalues also to approach zero faster than an exponential\nas the excitation level increases.\nA complete treatment at order S 2 requires developing a method to handle divergent traces that appear in\nsome terms. For example, a contribution arises to the\nvacuum-energy shift \u2206 in Eq. (74) that is proportional\nto Tr(S 2 E \u22122 ) and that appears to have a linear divergence. It is possible that combining this with the ghost\ncontribution would yield a finite result, but in general it\nmay be necessary to regulate such terms. Zeta-function\nregularization may be most appropriate, since it is known\nto avoid an associativity anomaly in the vertex in related\ncalculations [24].\nIn the ghost sector, an analogous construction for the\nnonperturbative vacuum N can be performed. It is\nstraightforward to extend the formal analysis to a solution in powers of S\u0303 and to extract results at order S\u0303.\nThe order S\u0303 0 equation has the same form as Eq. (80),\nso the complete lowest-order solution can be taken as\n(0)\nN00 = |\u2212is,t,u with all other components zero. The\n\nequivalent of Eq. (83) for the ghost sector is\n(0)\n\n[(t\u2020 E{S\u0303, E \u22122 }E \u22121 u\u2020 )N00\n\n\u03bc1 \u03bd1 (1)\n+[(t\u2020 E \u22122 )\u03bc1 u\u2020\u03bd1 + t\u2020\u03bc1 ((u\u2020 E \u22122 )\u03bd1 )]N02\n\n+higher-level terms]|+it,u\n+|N (1) i \u22c6 |N (0) i + |N (0) i \u22c6 |N (1) i = 0.\n\n(86)\n\nContributions from excitation number greater than 2 and\n(1)\nfrom N00 again can be neglected at this order.\nThe analogue of Eq. (84) in the limit of high mass level\nis\n\u03bc1 \u03bd1 (1)\nN02\n\u2248 \u2212(E S\u0303E \u22121 )\u03bc1 \u03bd1 .\n\n(87)\n\nEvidently, the contributions from ghost fields at excitation number 2 become of order S\u0303 2 in this limit. At low\nmass levels, an intermediate effect between cancellation\nof the term linear in S\u0303 and a reversal of the sign can\nagain be expected.\nB. Properties\n\nSince the form of our solution is Lorentz invariant by\nconstruction, we expect N to correspond to the Lorentzinvariant nonperturbative vacuum of Refs. [2\u20134]. The results in the previous subsection can be used to compare\nthe solution for N with numerical values for nonperturbative solutions obtained in the level-truncation scheme.\nIn Table 1 we list numerical approximations for some\ncomponent bosonic-sector scalar fields in the Lorentinvariant nonperturbative vacuum obtained [8] at level\ntruncation (10, 20), together with the range in which the\nO(S) solution for N indicates the values should lie. The\ndiscussion in the previous subsection implies that the\ntrue values are expected to lie near the maximum of this\nrange for low-lying states but to fall to the minimum of\nthe range as the level number increases. These results\nsupport the identification of N with the level-truncated\nLorentz-invariant nonperturbative vacuum.\nIn the ghost sector, the numerical values for the ghostoscillator fields follow a pattern similar to that in the\nbosonic sector. However, a numerical approximation for\nS\u0303 is more involved than for S because approximating T\u0303+\nby Taylor expansion of the square root in Eq. (43) fails\nfor the largest two eigenvalues of X\u0303, which lie outside\nthe radius of convergence. It would interesting to find\na means of approximating S\u0303 with sufficient accuracy to\nmake possible comparisons with truncation-scheme calculations.\nAt order S\u0303 2 , the level of technical complication increases and the corresponding analysis lies beyond the\nscope of this work. We conjecture that the cancellation\nmechanism occurring at linear order in the limit of high\nmass level generalizes at higher order. This is consistent\nwith the pattern emerging from numerical approximations using the truncation scheme.\n10\n\n\fh\u03c8i\n1.09259\n0.05723\n-0.01988\n-0.01018\n0.00783\n0.00823\n0.00429\n\nState\n|0i\na\u2020 1 * a\u2020 1 |0i\na\u2020 1 * a\u2020 3 |0i\na\u2020 2 * a\u2020 2 |0i\na\u2020 1 * a\u2020 5 |0i\na\u2020 2 * a\u2020 4 |0i\na\u2020 3 * a\u2020 3 |0i\n\nR\n\u03a62 + (\u22121)g(\u03a6R1 ) \u03a61 \u22c6 QB \u03a62 .

We conjecture that this operator has no tachyonic modes. This would provide further\nsupport for the idea that the squeezed field S provides\na useful starting point for investigating the nonperturbative structure of the open bosonic string, despite not\nbeing a solution of the string equations of motion.\nAs partial support for the conjecture, we verify it at order S for low-lying states in the bosonic sector. Consider\nfirst the state |0is . The S-background BRST operator\nQS acting on this state gives\n\nTable 1. Vacuum expectation values for bosonic-sector scalar\nstates in the nonperturbative vacuum. For each state, the expectation value h\u03c8i evaluated in the level-truncation scheme\nand the range allowed by the order-S calculation in the text\nare presented. The correct value is predicted to be near the\nmaximum of this range for low-lying states but rapidly to approach the minimum as the level number increases, in agreement with the results from the level-truncation scheme.\n\nIt is of interest to compare the vacuum energy EN of\nN to the D25-brane mass M25 . In principle, it suffices\nto evaluate the action I(\u03a8) for the on-shell string field\n\u03a8 = N and use EN = I(N ).

The result is to be compared with\nthe expected value EN = \u2212M25 = \u22122/\u03c0 2 \u2248 \u22120.20. Approximating the field N by S thus gives about 85% of\nthe D-brane mass.\nThe string action can also provide insight into the nature of excitations about the squeezed field S. Consider\nfirst a string field \u03a8 expanded about an arbitrary background \u03a8B : \u03a8 = \u03a8B + \u2206. The action for \u03a8 can be\nwritten [25]\nZ\nZ\n1\ng\nI(\u03a8) =\n\u03a8B \u22c6 \u03a8B \u22c6 \u03a8B\n\u03a8\n\u22c6\nQ\u03a8\n+\nB\nB\n2\u03b1\u2032\n3\nZ\nZ\ng\n1\n\u2206 \u22c6 \u2206 \u22c6 \u2206.\n(89)\n+ \u2032 \u2206 \u2217 QB \u2206 +\n2\u03b1\n3\n\n+P1 s\u2020n |0is \u22c6 |0is + |0is \u22c6 P2 s\u2020n |0is\n= ns\u2020n |0is .\n(93)\n\nSince n > 0, this calculation shows that the analogue of\nthe states a\u2020n |0ia that contain massless modes is here a\nset of purely massive states s\u2020n |0is .\nIt is believed that the endpoint of tachyon condensation on the D25-brane has no physical open-string excitations [5]. The corresponding conjecture in the present\ncontext is that no normalizable states can be constructed\non N . Equivalently, setting \u03a8B = N in the background\nequations above, one expects the background BRST operator QB = QN to have no normalizable physical fluctuations \u2206, so the coefficients of all physical kinetic terms\nfor \u2206 should vanish. An alternative would be to show\nthere are no zeros in the euclidean propagators for physical fields in the nonperturbative vacuum [2]. Although\nour construction of N sets the momenta to zero, it may\nbe possible to generalize it to incorporate euclidean propagators for \u2206 (cf. remarks in the next section). In any\nevent, it would be interesting to have an explicit proof of\nthis conjecture in the context of string field theory.\n\nHere, the action of the background BRST operator QB\non an arbitrary string field \u03a6 of ghost number g(\u03a6) is\ngiven by\nQB \u03a6 = Q\u03a6 + g\u03b1\u2032 [\u03a8B \u22c6 \u03a6 \u2212 (\u22121)g(\u03a6) \u03a6 \u22c6 \u03a8B ].\n\n(92)\n\n(90)\n\nThe background operator QB is nilpotent and distributive across the star product: QB (\u03a61 \u22c6 \u03a62 ) = QB \u03a61 \u22c6\n11\n\n\fWe note in passing that states on which the action\nof creation and annihilation operators produces only unnormalizable results can readily be found. For example, in the context ofPa one-dimensional\nbosonic oscilla\u221a\n\u2020 n\nn!]|0i\nhas\nfinite norm\n[(a\n)\n/n\ntor\nthe\nstate\n|\u03c8i\n=\nn\nP \u22122\n2\n\u2020\nn\n=\n\u03c0\n/6,\nbut\nthe\nnorms\nof\nboth\na\n|\u03c8i\nand a|\u03c8i\nn\nP\nbehave as n n\u22121 and so diverge. A multidimensional\n\u221a\nP\nversion of this is the state \u03a0m n [(a\u2020m )n /n n!]|0i, which\nitself is normalizable but produces unnormalizable states\nwhen acted on by any of the oscillator creation and annihilation operators a\u2020m , am . We anticipate that the nonperturbative vacuum N has similar features.\nA related issue is the fate of the low-energy U(1) or\nU(N) particle symmetry of the perturbative massless vectors in the nonperturbative vacuum N . In string field\ntheory, the nonabelian gauge symmetry is modified compared to the usual transformation law. It has been shown\nthat the nonperturbative vacuum N maintains the string\nU(N) symmetry contained in Eq. (91) in the sense that\nnonzero scalar expectation values remain invariant under a string U(N) transformation to all truncation orders\n[3]. However, this low-energy string symmetry is distinct\nfrom the usual U(N) particle gauge symmetry, with the\ntwo being related through a set of nonlinear field redefinitions [26]. The effect of this on the generation of a\nmass term for the U(1) field has recently been studied\nin the context of the level-truncation scheme [27]. Confinement via the condensation of magnetically charged\ntachyons has been suggested [28], the possibility of a critical value for the U(1) field above which no solutions exist\nhas been investigated [29], and it has also been proposed\nthat as the tachyon condenses the noncommutative gauge\nsymmetry is fully unbroken and becomes a linearly realized U(\u221e) forbidding propagation of open-string modes\n[30]. It would be interesting to investigate the U(N) particle symmetry in the context of the solution N found\nhere. The nonzero mass for vector excitations about the\nsqueezed field S, demonstrated by Eq. (93), suggests this\nparticle symmetry is destroyed in the nonperturbative\nvacuum.\n\nfor the matrices S = CT\u2212 and S\u0303 = C T\u0303+ in terms of the\n3-vertex functions V 11 and \u1e7c 11 in the momentum representation are determined by Eqs. (39) and (43). The\nproduct F F\u0303 \u2248 1 + O(S, S\u0303) is constructed recursively in\npowers of S and S\u0303 in section V.\nThe string field N can be regarded as a twisted\nsqueezed state. The construction (94) provides N in the\nform of a series of creation operators acting on a squeezed\nfield S. We suspect a closed form exists for this twist series. The rapid decay of the expectation values with level\nnumber appears to be a crucial feature of N . The occurrence of the operator L0 in the equations of motion and\nits growth with level number makes it a natural candidate\nfor controlling this rapid decay and hence the twist series,\nand we therefore conjecture that the closed form for N is\na twisted squeezed state with twist explicitly determined\nby L0 . In any case, it would be of interest to develop\nsystematic methods for handling the twist series. Note\nalso that the squeezed field S itself may merit further\nstudy in its own right. Although S does not solve the\nequations of motion, it may be a better starting point\nthan the usual perturbative vacuum for approximation\nschemes studying the properties of N .\nAn interesting issue is whether solutions exist to Eq.\n(79) other than N . This would imply that at least some\nterms with m 6= 0 in Eq. (79) are nonzero. Since the\nstar product between states with excitation numbers m1\nand m2 generally yields terms up to excitation number\n(m1 + m2 ), it seems likely that nonzero terms persist for\narbitrarily high excitation number. Any other solution\nto Eq. (79) is therefore unlikely to be simple within this\nframework even at low order. Also, satisfying the criterion of normalizability may be more difficult for any\nsuch solution because Eq. (79) suggests it must behave\n\u22122\nroughly as a functional linear in Enn\n= n, and hence\nlinear in the mass level.\n\nIt may also be possible to obtain other solutions of\ninterest by modifying the construction of N in a different way. In section V, attention was primarily restricted to states of even excitation number. However,\nmore general possibilities exist. For a bosonic tensor\n\u03bb1 ...\u03bbm \u03bc1 ...\u03bcn\nfmn\n, we can separate the indices according to\nleft and right sectors so that fmn is annihilated by con\u03bc\u2032\n\u03bb\u2032\ntracting with (P1 )\u03bci i and (P2 )\u03bbi i . The action of L0\ntakes fmn to a combination of terms having indices of\nthe type (m \u2212 2, n), (m \u2212 1, n \u2212 1), (m, n \u2212 2), (m, n),\n(m + 1, n \u2212 1), (m \u2212 1, n + 1), (m + 2, n), (m + 1, n + 1),\n(m, n + 2). These can be regarded as a field of black\nsquares on a chessboard: (n + m) modulo 2 is conserved.\nSince the star product combines an (m, k) tensor with a\n(k, n) tensor to yield an (m, n) tensor, it also preserves\nthe sum of the indices modulo 2. The possibility therefore exists of obtaining solutions fmn to the equations of\nmotion restricted to even (m + n) other than the nonperturbative vacuum N .\n\nVI. DISCUSSION\n\nUsing analytical methods, we have constructed a nonperturbative vacuum N satisfying the full equations of\nmotion (1) of string field theory. It appears to coincide with the Lorentz-invariant nonperturbative vacuum\nfound using the level-truncation scheme and resulting\nfrom tachyon condensation on a D25-brane.\nIn the original (a, b, c)-oscillator basis and in the SiegelFeynman gauge, the form of N is given as\n|N i = F (S, a\u2020 )F\u0303 (S\u0303, b\u2020 , c\u2020 )|Si.\n\n(94)\n\nHere, the squeezed field |Si satisfying Eq. (2) is explicitly\ngiven in closed form in Eq. (44). Closed-form expressions\n12\n\n\fparticular, the construction of N depends only on the\nformal structure of the vertex functions in terms of the\nmatrices C and U with properties (12). These matrices emerge from the conversion between the a0 oscillators and the momentum representation in section IIA.\nThey originate in a set of matrices C and U \u2032 with identical formal properties (9). It therefore follows that any\nspacetime-independent solution obtained in the momentum representation has an inequivalent partner solution\nin the a0 representation. Moreover, the conversion from\noscillator to momentum basis can be performed in any\nnumber p of spacetime dimensions desired. The construction implemented for N therefore suggests the existence\nof string fields that are twisted squeezed states in (26\u2212p)\ndimensions and are independent of the remaining p dimensions. We conjecture that these solutions include the\nDp-branes, along with instanton-type solutions.\nAnother topic of interest is the role and fate of the\nclosed-string modes in N . The Zwiebach string field\ntheory of the closed bosonic string is nonpolynomial\n[49]. Consistent implementation of the level-truncation\nscheme therefore presents some difficulties. At the level\nof the cubic interaction, a nonperturbative solution appears to exist in which the closed-string tachyon and the\ngraviton have no physical poles [50]. We anticipate that a\nclosed-string version of the squeezed field S can be constructed for this solution. If so, its idempotency may\nmake possible analytical study of the nonpolynomial action in the squeezed basis. It has also been shown that\nmacroscopic closed strings can be regarded as solitons in\nthe nonperturbative vacuum of the open bosonic string\n[51]. It would be interesting to study solutions of this\ntype in the squeezed-state basis.\nThe methodology in this paper could also be applied\nto study the nonperturbative vacua of other string field\ntheories with tachyons, including those for the non-GSOprojected superstring [9] and the p-adic string [52]. For\nthe latter, it has explicitly been proved that the extremum of the tachyon potential with a D25-brane is\nthe vacuum without one and that lump solutions are Dbranes of lower dimensions [53]. In light of the possibility\nof obtaining exact results, it would be interesting to investigate our construction for N in this context.\n\nYet another possibility is to consider solutions mixing\nthe colors on the chessboard. Unlike solutions restricted\nto even (m + n), which in general may or may not violate Lorentz symmetry, solutions with odd (m+ n) would\nhave an odd number of oscillators and hence would necessarily violate Lorentz symmetry. In string field theory,\nthe occurrence of static interaction terms quadratic in\ntensors and linear in scalars suggests the possibility of\nspontaneous breaking of Lorentz symmetry [31], which\nwould be accompanied by CPT violation when fields with\nodd level number are involved [32]. Indeed, a family of\nLorentz-violating and CPT-preserving solutions in the\nopen bosonic string has been uncovered using the leveltruncation scheme in the open bosonic string [4]. It would\nbe interesting to construct analytically the states corresponding to these solutions.\nIn general, the topic of Lorentz-violating solutions appears to be a potentially revealing subject for future\nstudy. Relatively little is known about the nature of these\nsolutions, including whether they are stable. Since they\nare spacetime independent, it appears unlikely that they\ncould correspond to any of the lump solutions discussed\nin the literature to date. The ubiquitous nature of the cubic scalar-tensor-tensor couplings suggets that Lorentzviolating solutions are generic in string field theories with\ntachyons. In fact, the existence of scalar-tensor-tensor\ncouplings is not restricted to string field theory, since\nthey also arise in off-shell calculations of the action using renormalization-group methods in the string sigma\nmodel [26].\nSince the physical world is believed to include a\ntachyon in its spectrum at the electroweak scale (the\nHiggs field), it is necessary for a realistic string theory\nto have at least one tachyonic mode. If Lorentz-violating\nsolutions are indeed generic in theories with tachyons, it\nis natural to speculate that the four-dimensional Lorentz\nand CPT symmetries might also be spontaneously broken. The resulting low-energy effects can be systematically studied [33]. The exquisite sensitivity of modern\nexperiments to such effects [34\u201342] means that even effects suppressed by the Planck scale could be detected.\nAnother interesting class of objects in string field\ntheory is the set of lump solutions. Using the leveltruncation scheme, it has been shown that bosonic Dpbranes can be interpreted as unstable lump configurations of open-string tachyons on a D25-brane [43], at least\nfor large p. Worldsheet-boundary renormalization-group\nmethods can be used to show that the mass of a tachyonic\nlump on a Dp-brane corresponds to that of a D(p \u2212 1)brane [44]. This has also been verified numerically in\na modified level-truncation scheme incorporating derivative couplings [45]. Some of these solutions are related\nto results in noncommutative field theory [46]. Various\nother calculations support these ideas [47,48].\nIt is plausible that a variant of our methodology could\nbe used to construct the lump solutions analytically.
