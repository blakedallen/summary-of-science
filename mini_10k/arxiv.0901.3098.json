Introduction\nVector Boson Fusion (VBF) Higgs boson production is the second largest production mechanism at the LHC. The cross section measurements of the VBF process, VV \u2192 H (qq \u2192 qqH),\nfollowed by Higgs boson decays into \u03c4\u03c4, WW and \u03b3\u03b3 will significantly extend the possibility of\nHiggs boson coupling measurements [1, 2].\n\n2. Vector Boson Fusion Signature\n\nNumber of entries\n\nEvents produced by VBF are characterized by a distict topology of the final state: two forward\njets with little extra hadronic activity and the decay products of the Higgs boson. The rapidity\ndistribution of the 3rd jet with respect to the two forward jets, \u03b7j3\u2217 , is shown in Fig. 1 (left) which\nshows a double-peak structure for the electroweak processes, including the VBF signal, and is\nmore central for the QCD background samples. Applying a central jet veto (CJV) is a poweful\nrejection method against the QCD background. To avoid considering jets from pile-up events in\nthe CJV, jets are associated to the signal vertex using tracks. For every extra jet one can define the\nquantity \u03b1j3 = \u03a3pTtrk /ETj3 , where pTtrk is the pT of tracks from the signal vertex within the jet cone\nand ETj3 is the jet measured raw ET . Figure 1 (right) shows \u03b13j tends to peak at low values for\nnon-signal jets. The efficiency of the veto for the background samples versus the signal efficiency\nis shown in Figure 2 (left) for events containg a 3rd jet with ET larger than different threshold\nvalues. An optimal threshold where the signal process has \u223c80% efficiency while the backgrounds\nare suppressed below 50% is used [3]. An alternative approach is to consider a track counting\nveto (TCV) [4], where the number of tracks between the two leading jets is counted with different\npT thresholds. Figure 2 (right) shows the performance of the TCV algorithm, i.e the efficiency of\nselecting the signal versus the background for events with an increasing cut on the track multiplicity\nand pT . The black star indicates the performance of the CJV based on calorimeter jets. The TCV\nalgorithm can reach similar discrimination power than the central jet veto.\n\n90\n80\n70\n\nSignal, qqH\nQCD 2\u03c4+2/3jet\nEW 2\u03c4+2jet\ntt \u2192 WbWb\n\n60\n50\n40\n30\n\nW+3/4jet\n\n20\n10\n0\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03b7*j3 = \u03b7j3 - (\u03b7j1 + \u03b7j2)/2\n\nFigure 1: The \u03b7 distribution of the 3rd jet with respect to the two forward jets (left).

Vector Boson Fusion Higgs Discovery Potential\nThe observability of the VBF Higgs boson production has been studied with the full CMS\ndetector simulation in the H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4, \u03b3\u03b3 and WW decay channels [5]. VBF H \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 production\nhas been studied in the Higgs mass range of 115 to 145 GeV in the lepton plus \u03c4jet final state.\nFigure 3 (left) shows the expected di-\u03c4 mass distribution using the collinear approximation [3] for\na luminosity of 30 fb\u22121 .

Search of Higgs\u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 lepton + \u03c4jet with 1 fb\u22121\n\nevents / 10 GeV\n\nA selection strategy for the search of VBF Higgs \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 lepton + \u03c4jet with 1 fb\u22121 has been\ndeveloped and is described in detail in [8]. The di-\u03c4 invariant mass will be analyzed to search\nfor the presence of a Higgs boson in the region above the Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 mass peak. It is important\nto know well the shape of the Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 background. The dominant uncertainty comes from the\nmodeling of the missing transverse momentum related to the effects of pile-up, underlying event\nand the calorimeter noise and response. A method to model the di-\u03c4 mass has been developed [4].\nZ \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc data events are selected and the muons are removed from the real event. Di-\u03c4 Monte Carlo\nevents are generated with the same kinematics as the real muons and their detector response is fully\nsimulated. Finally the real Z \u2192 \u03bc \u03bc events with the muons removed and the simulated di-\u03c4 events\nare super-imposed to form one event, Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03bc \u03c4\u03bc , and the di-\u03c4 mass is calculated. The reconstructed\ndi-\u03c4 mass for real and fake Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events for inclusive Drell-Yan and Z+jets events are shown in\nFig. 5. A good agreement between the di-\u03c4 mass shapes is obtained.\nThe expected di-\u03c4 mass distribution for the background and the Higgs signal for 1 fb\u22121 is\nshown in Fig. 6 (left). A profile likelihood method is used to evaluate the upper limit on the\nnumber of signal events. Figure 6 (right) shows the expected 95% CL limit on the cross section\ntimes branching ratio as a function of the Higgs boson mass.\n2200\n\nZ \u2192 \u03c4\u03bc \u03c4\u03bc\n\n2000\n\nZ\u2192\u03c4\u03c4\n\n1800\n1600\n\n\u222b L dt = 130 pb\n\n-1\n\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n\nratio (\u03c4\u03bc\u03c4\u03bc / \u03c4 \u03c4)\n\n200\n0\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n1.2\n1.1\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n\nCMS preliminary\n\nm\u03c4 \u03c4 [GeV/c2]\n\nFigure 5: Reconstructed di-\u03c4 mass for real and fake Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 events for the final states (left) \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bd + \u03bc\u03bd\u03bd\nfrom inclusive Drell-Yan events and (right) \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 l\u03bd\u03bd + \u03c4 jet \u03bd from Z+jets events.\n\n4\n\n\fM\u00f3nica Luisa V\u00e1zquez Acosta (on behalf of the CMS Collaboration)\n\n-1\n\n8\n\nZ+jets,Z \u2192 ee, jet \u2192 \u03c4\nZ+jets, Z \u2192 ee, e \u2192 \u03c4\n\n95% CL\n\nCMS Preliminary\n\n\u222b L dt = 1 fb\n\n\u03b3 +jets\nt t ,WW \u2192 all\nW+jets,W \u2192l \u03bd\n\n7\n\nQCD PYTHIA\nZ+jets,Z \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\n\n6\n\nSM\n\n9\n\n2\n\nH \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 (135 GeV/c ) x 10\n\n5\n\n25\n\nCMS Preliminary\n\n\u222b L dt = 1 fb\n\n20\n\n-1\n\n\u03c3/\u03c3\n\nN events at 1 fb-1\n\nVBF Higgs Production at the LHC\n\n15\n\n4\n10\n\n3\n2\n\nWithout systematics\n\n5\n\n1\n00\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n250\nM(\u03c4\u03c4) [GeV/c2]\n\nWith systematics\n\nH \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4 \u2192 l \u03bd\u03bd + \u03c4had \u03bd\n0\n\n115\n\n120\n\n125\n\n130\n\n135\n\n140\n\n145\n2\nmH [GeV/c ]\n\nFigure 6: Di-\u03c4 mass distribution of expected backgrounds with 1 fb\u22121 after all selection.

Conclusion\nA selection strategy for the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in vector boson fusion\ndecaying to a pair of \u03c4 leptons with 1 fb\u22121 of early CMS data at the LHC has been presented. No\nsignal evidence is expected and upper limit on the cross section times branching ratio is evaluated.\nProspective analyses for the H \u2192 \u03b3\u03b3, WW and \u03c4\u03c4 decay channels for a luminosity of 30 fb\u22121 have\nalso been discussed. For a Higgs boson mass in the range 115 to 140 GeV, an observation with a\nsignificance above 2 standard deviations is expected in the H to \u03b3\u03b3 channel, and above 3 standard\ndeviations in the H to \u03c4\u03c4 channel. The H to WW channel offers a discovery reach above 5 sigma\nin the mass range of 140 to 200 GeV.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Zeppenfeld et al., Measuring Higgs boson couplings at the LHC, Phys. Rev.
