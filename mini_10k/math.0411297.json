BRADLEY\nAbstract. In survival or reliability studies, the mean residual life or life expectancy is\nan important characteristic of the model. Whereas the failure rate can be expressed quite\nsimply in terms of the mean residual life and its derivative, the inverse problem-namely\nthat of expressing the mean residual life in terms of the failure rate-typically involves\nan integral of a complicated expression. In this paper, we obtain simple expressions for\nthe mean residual life in terms of the failure rate for certain classes of distributions which\nsubsume many of the standard cases. Several results in the literature can be obtained\nusing our approach. Additionally, we develop an expansion for the mean residual life in\nterms of Gaussian probability functions for a broad class of ultimately increasing failure\nrate distributions. Some examples are provided to illustrate the procedure.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn life testing situations, the expected additional lifetime given that a component has\nsurvived until time t is a function of t, called the mean residual life. More specifically, if\nthe random variable X represents the life of a component, then the mean residual life is\ngiven by m(t) = E(X \u2212 t|X > t). The mean residual life has been employed in life length\nstudies by various authors, e.g. Bryson and Siddiqui (1969), Hollander and Proschan\n(1975), and Muth (1977). Limiting properties of the mean residual life have been studied\nby Meilijson (1972), Balkema and de Hann (1974), and more recently by Bradley and\nGupta (2002). A smooth estimator of the mean residual life is given by Chaubey and Sen\n(1999).\nIt is well known that the failure rate can be expressed quite simply in terms of the mean\nresidual life and its derivative: see (2.4) below. However, the inverse problem-namely\nthat of expressing the mean residual life in terms of the failure rate-typically involves an\nintegral of a complicated expression. In this paper, we obtain a simple expression for the\nmean residual life in terms of the failure rate for certain classes of distributions. Many\nof the standard cases are subsumed, and several results in the literature can be obtained\nDate: February 1, 2008.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

GUPTA AND DAVID M. BRADLEY\n\nusing our approach. However, the emphasis here is to express the mean residual life in\nterms of the failure rate. For the class of ultimately increasing failure rate distributions,\nwe also provide sufficient conditions under which the mean residual life can be expanded in\nterms of Gaussian probability functions. Finally, some examples are presented to illustrate\nthe procedure.\n2. Background and Definitions\nLet F : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e) be a nondecreasing, right continuous function with F (0) = 0,\nlimx\u2192\u221e F (x) = 1, and let \u03bd denote the induced Lebesgue-Stieljes measure. (Equivalently,\nlet \u03bd be a probability measure on [0, \u221e) and let F be the cumulative distribution function\nof \u03bd.) If X is a nonnegative random variable representing the life of a component having\ndistribution function F , the mean residual life is defined by\nZ \u221e\n1\nm(t) = E(X \u2212 t|X > t) =\n(x \u2212 t) d\u03bd(x),\nt \u2265 0,\nF (t) t\nRx\nwhere F = 1 \u2212 F is the so-called survival function. Writing x \u2212 t = t du and employing\nTonelli's theorem yields the equivalent formula\nZ \u221eZ x\nZ \u221eZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n1\n1\n1\nF (u) du,\n(2.1)\nm(t) =\ndu d\u03bd(x) =\nd\u03bd(x) du =\nF (t) t\nF (t) t\nF (t) t\nt\nu\nwhich is sometimes also used as a definition. The cumulative hazard function may be\ndefined by R = \u2212 log F . Then (2.1) implies that\nZ \u221e\n\b\nm(t) =\nexp R(t) \u2212 R(t + x) dx.\n(2.2)\n0\n\nIf F (equivalently, \u03bd) is also absolutely continuous, then the probability density function\nf and the failure rate (hazard function) r are defined almost everywhere by f = F \u2032 and\nr = f / F = R\u2032 , respectively, and then\nZ t\nZ t\ndF (x)\nR(t) = \u2212 log F (t) = \u2212\n=\nr(x) dx.\n(2.3)\n0 F (x)\n0\nIn view of (2.2) and (2.3), we have expressed m in terms of r, albeit somewhat indirectly.\nIdeally, we'd like to express the mean residual life in terms of known functions of the\nfailure rate and its derivatives without the use of integrals. In any case, it is useful to have\nalternative representations of the mean residual life. We note that the converse problem,\nthat of expressing the failure rate in terms of the mean residual life and its derivatives is\ntrivial, for (2.1) and (2.3) imply that\nm\u2032 (t) = r(t)m(t) \u2212 1.\n\n(2.4)\n\n\fREPRESENTING THE MEAN RESIDUAL LIFE\n\n3\n\n3. A General Family of Distributions, Including the Pearson Family\nConsider the family of distributions whose probability density function f is differentiable. Write\n\u03bc \u2212 x g \u2032(x)\nf \u2032 (x)\n=\n\u2212\n,\n(3.1)\nf (x)\ng(x)\ng(x)\nwhere \u03bc is a constant, and g satisfies the first order linear differential equation\ng \u2032(x) +\n\nf \u2032 (x)\ng(x) = \u03bc \u2212 x.\nf (x)\n\nAlternatively, we may view g as given; then f is uniquely determined by (3.1). Clearing\nthe fractions in (3.1) and integrating yields\nZ \u221e\nxf (x) dx = \u03bcF (t) + g(t)f (t),\nt \u2265 0.\nt\n\nIn other words,\nE(X|X > t) = \u03bc + g(t)r(t),\n\nt \u2265 0,\n\n(3.2)\n\nor equivalently,\nm(t) = \u03bc \u2212 t + g(t)r(t),\n\nt \u2265 0.\n\n(3.3)\n\nThus, the mean residual life has been expressed in terms of the failure rate r, the given\nfunction g, and the constant \u03bc. By appropriately specializing g in (3.3), one can obtain\nmany of the important cases that have appeared in the literature. We note that a result\nsimilar to (3.3) was obtained by Ruiz and Navarro (1994), but their emphasis was different.\n3.1. The Pearson Family. The quadratic function g(x) = a0 + a1 x + a2 x2 with a2 6=\n\u22121/2 yields the Pearson family, special cases of which include the beta distributions, the\ngamma distribution, and the normal distribution. From (3.1), we have\n\u03bc\u2212x\na1 + 2a2 x\nx+d\nf \u2032 (x)\n=\n\u2212\n=\u2212\n,\n2\n2\nf (x)\na0 + a1 x + a2 x\na0 + a1 x + a2 x\nA0 + A1 x + A2 x2\n\n(3.4)\n\nsay, where Aj = aj /(1 + 2a2 ) for j = 0, 1, 2 and d = (a1 \u2212 \u03bc)/(1 + 2a2 ). For the Pearson\nfamily, (3.2) gives\nE(X|X > t) =\n\nA1 \u2212 d\nA0 + A1 t + A2 t2\n+\nr(t).\n1 \u2212 2A2\n1 \u2212 2A2\n\n(3.5)\n\nSee Nair and Sankaran (1991) and Ruiz and Navarro (1994). Note that since A2 =\na2 /(1 + 2a2 ), it is impossible for 1 \u2212 2A2 to vanish in (3.5).\n\n\f4\n\nRAMESH C. GUPTA AND DAVID M. BRADLEY\n\n3.1.1. The Beta Distributions. With g(x) = x(1\u2212x)/(a+b), we have the beta distribution\nof the first kind:\n\u0393(a + b) a\u22121\nf (x) =\nx (1 \u2212 x)b\u22121 , 0 < x < 1, a > 0, b > 0.\n\u0393(a)\u0393(b)\nIt satisfies\n\nx + (1 \u2212 a)/(a + b \u2212 2)\nf \u2032 (x)\n=\u2212\n,\nf (x)\nx(1 \u2212 x)/(a + b \u2212 2)\n\na + b 6= 2,\n\nand hence belongs to the Pearson family given by (3.4) with d = (1 \u2212 a)/(a + b \u2212 2),\nA0 = 0, A1 = \u2212A2 = 1/(a + b \u2212 2), and a + b 6= 2. Thus,\nE(X|X > t) = \u03bc +\n\nt(1 \u2212 t)\nr(t),\na+b\n\nwhere \u03bc = a/(a + b). If a + b = 2, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013a\u22121\nx\n1\n,\nf (x) =\n\u0393(a)\u0393(2 \u2212 a) 1 \u2212 x\n\n0 < t < 1,\n\n0 < a < 2,\n\nand g(x) = x(1 \u2212 x)/2, \u03bc = a/2, from which (3.2) gives\nE(X|X > t) = 21 a + 12 t(1 \u2212 t)r(t),\n\n0 < t < 1.\n\nThe beta distribution of the second kind has the form\nf (x) =\nSince then\n\ncx\u03b2\u22121\n,\n(\u03b3 + x)\u03b1+\u03b2\n\nc, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, x > 0.\n\nx + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b3/(\u03b1 + 1)\nf \u2032 (x)\n=\u2212 2\n,\nf (x)\nx /(\u03b1 + 1) + \u03b3x/(\u03b1 + 1)\n\nf belongs to the Pearson family (3.4) with d = (1 \u2212 \u03b2)\u03b3/(1 + \u03b1), A0 = 0, A1 = \u03b3/(1 + \u03b1),\nand A2 = 1/(1 + \u03b1). Hence,\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nt + \u03b3t\nE(X|X > t) = \u03bc +\nr(t),\n\u03b1 6= 1,\n\u03b1\u22121\nwhere \u03bc = \u03b2\u03b3/(\u03b1 \u2212 1) is the mean. A similar result was obtained by Ahmed (1991) using\na completely different approach.\n3.1.2. The Gamma Distribution. Let B > 0. The linear function g(x) = Bx for x > 0\nyields the gamma distribution. In this case, (3.1) gives\nx+B\u2212\u03bc\nf \u2032 (x)\n=\u2212\n,\nf (x)\nBx\n\n\fREPRESENTING THE MEAN RESIDUAL LIFE\n\n5\n\nso that f belongs to the Pearson family (3.4) with d = B \u2212 \u03bc, A0 = 0, A1 = B, and\nA2 = 0. In fact,\nf (x) =\n\nB \u2212\u03bc/B \u03bc/B\u22121 \u2212x/B\nx\ne\n,\n\u0393(\u03bc/B)\n\na gamma distribution with mean \u03bc. Hence (3.2) takes the form\nE(X|X > t) = \u03bc + Btr(t)\nin this case. This is Theorem 1 of Osaki and Li (1988). See also El-Arishy (1995).\n3.1.3. The Normal Distribution. Let \u03c3 > 0. The constant function g(x) = \u03c3 2 for \u2212\u221e <\nx < \u221e yields the normal distribution. In this case, (3.1) gives\n\u03bc\u2212x\nf \u2032 (x)\n=\n,\nf (x)\n\u03c32\nso that f belongs to the Pearson family (3.4) with d = \u2212\u03bc, A0 = \u03c3 2 , and A1 = A2 = 0.\nIt follows that\n\b\nf (x) = \u03c3 \u22121 (2\u03c0)\u22121/2 exp \u2212 (x \u2212 \u03bc)2 /2\u03c3 2 ,\na normal distribution with mean \u03bc and variance \u03c3 2 . Hence (3.2) can be written as\nE(X|X > t) = \u03bc + \u03c3 2 r(t).\nThis is Theorem 3.1 of Ahmed and Abdul-Rahman (1993). See also McGill (1992) and\nKotz and Shanbhag (1980).\n3.2. The Maxwell Distribution. The Maxwell distribution has the form\nf (x) = 4b\u22123 \u03c0 \u22121/2 x2 exp{\u2212x2 /b2 },\n\nx > 0,\n\nb > 0.\n\nSee El-Arishy (1993). We then have\nf \u2032 (x)\n2 2x\n= \u2212 2,\nf (x)\nx\nb\nwhich can be written in the form (3.1) with \u03bc = 0 and g(x) = (1 + b2 /x2 )b2 /2. Hence,\nE(X|X > t) =\n\n(t2 + b2 )b2 r(t)\n.\n2t2\n\nThe fact that the corresponding failure rate is increasing can be seen by using Glaser's\n(1980) result.\n\n\f6\n\nRAMESH C. GUPTA AND DAVID M. BRADLEY\n\n4. Ultimately Increasing Failure Rate Distributions\nConsider the class of distributions whose failure rate is ultimately increasing. More\nspecifically, the failure rate should be strictly increasing from some point onward. Obviously, the important class of lifetime distributions having a bathtub-shaped failure rate\nwith change points 0 \u2264 t1 \u2264 t2 < \u221e (i.e. for which the failure rate is strictly decreasing\non the interval [0, t1 ], constant on [t1 , t2 ] and strictly increasing on [t2 , \u221e)) constitutes a\nproper subclass of the distributions we consider here. We'll see that if the failure rate is\nstrictly increasing from some point onward, then under certain additional conditions the\nmean residual life can be expanded in terms of Gaussian probability functions.\nNotation. Our conventions regarding the Bachmann-Landau O-notation, the Vinogradov\n\u226a-notation, and o-notation are fairly standard. Thus, if h is a function of a positive real\nvariable, the symbol O(h(t)), t \u2192 \u221e, denotes an unspecified function g for which there\nexist positive real numbers t0 and B such that |g(t)| \u2264 B|h(t)| for all real t > t0 . For such\ng we write g(t) \u226a h(t) or g(t) = O(h(t)). The notation g(t) = o(h(t)), t \u2192 \u221e, means\nthat for every real \u03b5 > 0, no matter how small, there exists a positive real number t0 such\nthat |g(t)| \u2264 \u03b5|h(t)| whenever t > t0 .\nTheorem 1. Suppose that from some point onward, the failure rate r increases (strictly)\nwithout bound. Suppose further that for some positive integer n, the n \u2212 1 derivative is\ncontinuous and satisfies\nt \u2192 \u221e,\nr (n\u22121) (t + x) \u226a r (n\u22121) (t) ,\n\u0001\nuniformly in x for 0 \u2264 x \u2264 min 1, |r \u2032\u2032(t)|\u22121/3 , and\n\u0001\nr (j) (t) \u226a max 1, |r \u2032\u2032(t)|(j+1)/3 ,\nt \u2192 \u221e,\n3 \u2264 j \u2264 n \u2212 1.\n\n(4.1)\n\nFinally, suppose there exists a positive real number \u03b5 such that for each integer j in the\nrange 3 \u2264 j \u2264 n,\n\u0001\nr (j\u22121) (t) = o (r(t))j\u2212j\u03b5 ,\nt \u2192 \u221e.\n(4.2)\nThen we have the following expansion for the mean residual life:\nm(t) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u0001\nbk (t)\u03c6k (t) + o (r(t))\u22121\u2212n\u03b5 ,\n\nt \u2192 \u221e,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere the coefficients bk (t) are given by the formal power series identity\n\u221e\nX\nk=0\n\nk\n\nbk x = exp\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2212\n\n\u221e\nX\nk=3\n\nr\n\n(k\u22121)\n\n\u001b\nxk\n(t)\n,\nk!\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fREPRESENTING THE MEAN RESIDUAL LIFE\n\n7\n\nand\n\u221e\n\nxk exp{\u2212xr(t) \u2212 21 x2 r \u2032 (t)} dx\n0\ns\n\u0013\u0013\n\u001a 2 \u001b\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0012\np\n2\u03c0 \u2202 k\np\nk\nexp\n1\u2212\u03a6 p\n= (\u22121)\n\u2032\nk\n\u2032\nr (t) \u2202p\n2r \u2032 (t)\nr (t)\n\n\u03c6k (t) =\n\nHere,\n\nZ\n\np=r(t)\n\n\u0015\n.\n\n(4.5)\n\nZ x\n1\n2\n\u03a6(x) = \u221a\ne\u2212v /2 dv\n(4.6)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nis the Gaussian probability function, i.e. the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.\nBefore proving Theorem 1, we make some preliminary remarks and give two illustrative\nexamples. First, if r \u2032\u2032 (t) = 0, then the uniformity condition on x in (4.1) should be\ninterpreted as 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1. Next, observe that the hypothesis (4.2) becomes more restrictive\nas \u03b5 increases. In particular \u03b5 > 1 implies limt\u2192\u221e r (j\u22121) (t) = 0. Of course, as \u03b5 increases,\nthe error term in (4.3) decreases. On the other hand, if 0 < \u03b5 < 1, then r (j\u22121) (t) does not\nnecessarily approach zero, but the correspondingly weaker hypothesis implies a weaker\nconclusion (larger error term). In any case, since r increases without bound, the error\nterm tends to zero as t \u2192 \u221e. Additionally, if r is infinitely differentiable we may let\nn \u2192 \u221e in (4.3) to obtain the convergent infinite series expansion\nm(t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbk (t)\u03c6k (t),\n\nk=0\n\nvalid for all sufficiently large values of t. (More specifically, for those t for which r(t) > 1.)\nIn general, however, we do not assume the failure rate has infinitely many derivatives;\nn is fixed and the generating function (4.4) is a formal power series. Expanding (4.4) to\ncompute bk (t) in terms of r(t) and its derivatives shows that if r has only n\u22121 derivatives,\nthen bk (t) is undefined if k \u2265 n. Differentiating (4.4) leads to the recurrence\nk\n\nbk+1 (t) = \u2212\n\n1 X r (j) (t)\nbk\u2212j (t),\nk + 1 j=2 j!\n\nk \u2265 2,\n\n(4.7)\n\nfrom which the coefficients bk (t) may be successively determined, starting with the initial\nvalues b0 (t) = 1, b1 (t) = b2 (t) = 0.

Applications\nWe provide two examples indicating how Theorem 1 may be applied.\nExample 1. Consider a linear failure rate of the form\nr(t) = \u03b1 + \u03b2t,\n\n\u03b2 > 0.\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe motivation and application of (5.1) to analyzing various data sets has been demonstrated by Kodlin (1967) and Carbone et al. (1967). Statistical inference related to the\n\n\fREPRESENTING THE MEAN RESIDUAL LIFE\n\n9\n\nlinear failure rate model has been studied by Bain (1974), Shaked (1974) and more recently by Sen and Bhatacharya (1995). For this model, the hypotheses of Theorem 1\nare trivially satisfied for any positive integer n and any positive real number \u03b5. Since r \u2032\u2032\nvanishes identically in this case, we see that bk (t) = 0 for k > 0 in (4.3) and in fact we\nhave the exact result\n\u0013\u0013r\n\u001b\u0012\n\u0012\n\u001a\nZ \u221e\n\u03b1 + \u03b2t\n2\u03c0\n(\u03b1 + \u03b2t)2\n2\n\u221a\n1\u2212\u03a6\n.\nm(t) =\nexp{\u2212(\u03b1 + \u03b2t)x \u2212 \u03b2x /2} dx = exp\n2\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\u03b2\n0\nExample 2. Chen (2000) proposes the two-parameter distribution with cumulative distribution function given by\n\b\n\u0001\nF (t) = 1 \u2212 exp 1 \u2212 exp(t\u03b2 ) \u03bb ,\nt > 0,\n\nwhere \u03bb > 0 and \u03b2 > 0 are parameters. The corresponding hazard function is the\nultimately strictly increasing function of t given by\nr(t) = \u03bb\u03b2t\u03b2\u22121 exp(t\u03b2 ),\n\nt > 0.\n\n(5.2)\n\nIt is straightforward, albeit somewhat tedious, to verify that Chen's failure rate (5.2)\nsatisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 1 with n > 2 and 0 < \u03b5 \u2264 2/3. Clearly \u03b5 = 2/3 is\noptimal here. Thus, with derivatives of r in (4.4) and (4.5) now coming from (5.2), we\nsee that the asymptotic formula\nm(t) =\n\nn\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\n\u0001\nbk \u03c6k (t) + o (r(t))\u22121\u22122n/3 ,\n\nt \u2192 \u221e,\n\nholds for all integers n > 2. In particular, as the error term in (4.3) tends to zero in the\nlimit as n \u2192 \u221e, we obtain the convergent infinite series representation\nm(t) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nbk (t)\u03c6k (t),\n\nk=0\n\nvalid for all sufficiently large values of t. There is no need to work out the coefficients\nbk (t) explicitly in this case. One can simply use the recurrence (4.7) to generate them.\n6. Proofs\n6.1. Proof of Theorem 1. Since the failure rate is strictly increasing from some point\nonward, there exists t0 \u2265 0 such that r \u2032 (t) > 0 for all t \u2265 t0 . Also, since limt\u2192\u221e r(t) = \u221e,\nthere exists\nt1 \u2265 0\u0001 such that r(t) \u2265 1 for t \u2265 t1 . Now let t \u2265 max(t0 , t1 ), \u03b4 = \u03b4(t) =\np\n3\nmin 1, 1/ |r \u2032\u2032 (t)| , and set\nZ \u03b4\nZ \u221e\nI(t) :=\nexp{R(t) \u2212 R(t + x)} dx,\nJ(t) :=\nexp{R(t) \u2212 R(t + x)} dx,\n0\n\n\u03b4\n\n\f10\n\nRAMESH C.
