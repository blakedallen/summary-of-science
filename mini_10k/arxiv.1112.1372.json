Many models in the queueing and service\nmanagement literature, such as dynamic staffing policies, server vacation mechanisms, etc. can\nbe viewed as different aspects of varying the rate at which service is provided at different times.\n\u2217\n\nResearch supported by the Greek Secreteriat of Research and Technology under Greece/Turkey bilateral research collaboration program.

Viewed in this way, a service control\npolicy provides a balance in the tradeoff between long customer delays and high service costs.\nHowever, in situations where customers are sensitive to delay and make individual decisions\nabout entering the queue, the policy used by the service provider may also have an indirect,\nalbeit significant, effect on the arrival stream.\nIn service systems with strategic customer behavior, incoming customers decide independently\nwhether to join the system or balk, based on an individual utility function that combines the\nvalue of obtaining the service with the cost induced by the anticipated delay in the queue. Since\na customer's delay depends on the decisions of other customers, a game-theoretic approach is\nappropriate for characterizing customer behavior and thus the properties of the incoming stream,\nas the result of an equilibrium strategy. Because customers are averse to delay, it is expected\nthat a particular customer's decision to enter the system is adversely affected as other customers\nalso decide to enter and system congestion is increased. In economic terms, entering customers\ninduce negative externalities, by imposing increased delays to present and/or future arrivals.\nSuch situations, where in equilibrium a customer's willingness to join is a decreasing function\nof the arrival rate, are referred to as Avoid the Crowd (ATC). On the other hand, in a system\nwhere a form of dynamic service control is implemented, the service rate is usually increased\nwhen the system is congested. Thus, it may happen that if a customer decides to enter the\nsystem, the other customers experience a benefit, because the service provider is induced to\nincrease the service rate. Then, the net effect between the additional delay due to increased\narrivals and the higher service speed due to the server's policy may be positive. In such cases\nwhere an arriving customer induces positive externalities, the equilibrium is Follow the Crowd\n(FTC). Both the ATC or FTC effects may appear in the same system for different values of the\narrival rate. However in most situations, the presence of FTC is related to a dynamic service\npolicy employed by the service provider.\nIn this paper we analyze the customer equilibrium behavior in a single server Markovian queue\nunder a simple threshold-based service rate policy. Specifically, the service rate is kept at a\nlow value when the number of customers in the system is at or below a threshold level T , and\nturns to a high value when the system congestion is above T . We analyze the unobservable\ncase where arriving customers are aware of the service policy, but do not have any information\non the queue length upon arrival. The most pronounced effect of the service control policy is\nthat, in contrast to the simple M/M/1 queue in strategic equilibrium, the equilibrium customer\nstrategy is not generally unique. For example, one equilibrium strategy may be such that a\nsmall fraction of incoming customers joins the system and as a result the server works at slow\nrate for most of the time, whereas there exists another equilibrium where the arrival rate is high\nand the server spends most time at the fast mode. We show that, depending on the values of\nthe various parameters, the number of strategic equilibria may vary from one to at most three.\n\n2\n\n\fWe also consider the problem of determining the optimal arrival rate in a system with centrally\ncontrol arrivals which, for the given service policy, maximizes the expected net benefit of all\ncustomers, and compare the optimal arrival rates to those obtained as equilibria under selfish\ncustomer behavior.\nThe implications of strategic customer behavior on the performance of a queueing system has\nbeen studied extensively in the recent years. Early works on the M/M/1 queue include Naor\n(1969) and Edelson & Hildebrand (1975) for the observable and unobservable models, respectively. Many variations of the original models have been studied since, and a comprehensive\nreview of the literature until 2003 is provided in Hassin & Haviv (2003). Among the models\nthat have been developed and analyzed, many include some varying service rate characteristics\nindirectly. For example, the capacity choice problem can be viewed as long-term service rate\ndecision. Stenbacka & Tombak (1995) consider an unobservable system with nonhomogeneous\ncustomer delay costs and service rate decisions made by the firm. Chen & Frank (2004) analyze\nthe joint impact of a firm's service and pricing policy on customer equilibrium.\nIn observable models, where customers obtain full or partial information on system congestion or\nanticipated delay, a varying service rate policy may have analogous effects. Armony & Maglaras\n(2004) analyze the impact of announcing anticipated delays and providing a call back option on\ncustomer joining behavior, in a call center with two service modes. Debo & Veeraraghavan (2009)\nconsider a situation where the service rate is related to the quality of service, it is unknown to\narriving customers but can be estimated by observing the queue length. It is shown that when\nthe service rate and the quality of service are negatively correlated, customers join longer queues,\nwhich is not the case under positive correlation.\nOther systems with a varying service rate feature include vacation queues and systems in a\nrandom environment. Burnetas & Economou (2007) consider a system with server vacations\nand reactivation that requires a random setup time. In the vacation model of Guo & Hassin\n(2011), the server resumes service after a fixed number of arrivals according to a threshold service\npolicy. Both papers analyze equilibrium behavior with respect to several levels of information\nabout the queue length and the state of the server. Economou & Manou (2011) analyze customer\nequilibrium strategies in a stochastic clearing system where the exogenous customer arrival rate\nand the arrival rate of the system clearing server vary according to an external environment\nprocess.\nIn the area of queueing control and optimization under a single decision maker, problems of\nservice rate control have been studied extensively and in many forms. It is worth noting that\nthe problem of social welfare maximization can be formulated as a static or dynamic admission\ncontrol problem. George & Harrison (2001) consider welfare optimization in an M/M/1 system\nwith dynamic service control and constant arrival rate. They develop an asymptotic method for\ncomputing the optimal policy under average cost minimization. Ata & Shneorson (2006) propose\na model that jointly optimizes arrival and service rates, and develop a dynamic pricing strategy\n\n3\n\n\fthat induces the optimal arrival and service rates. Adusumilli & Hasenbein (2010) consider a\nmodel of joint admission and service control in an M/M/1 under an average cost criterion and\nshow that the optimal service rates are increasing with system congestion. Dimitrakopoulos &\nBurnetas (2011) analyze the effect of service rate flexibility on the admission control policy and\nthe service provider's profit and derive a condition for the service flexibility to be beneficial.\nThe present paper proposes a direct model of the impact of dynamic service control on customer\nequilibrium strategies. The service rate is dynamically adjusted with state congestion. Under\nthis situation, the delay function is not monotone increasing in the arrival rate, which implies that\nfor certain ranges of the arrival rate, joining customers impose positive externalities. Another\nconsequence is that in general there exist more than one strategic equilibria, however we show\nthat their number is at most three. We also consider the social welfare optimization problem and\nthe relationship between the equilibrium and optimal arrival rates. We show via computational\nexperiments that optimal arrival rate lies between the extreme values under equilibrium, due to\nthe existence of both negative and positive externalities.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the model and the\ncorresponding customer strategic behavior problem. We also derive the expected delay as a\nfunction of the arrival rate. In Section 3 we consider the equilibrium strategies and derive the\nupper bound on the number of equilibria for general T -threshold dynamic service policies. In\nSection 4 we explore numerically the socially optimal strategy and the comparison with the\nequilibrium problem. In Section 5, we derive analytic solutions for both problems in the special\ncase where the service threshold T = 1, i.e., the service rate switches to the fast mode when the\nqueue is not empty. Section 6 concludes.\n\n2\n\nModel Description\n\nWe consider a single server Markovian queue under the FCFS discipline, where potential customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate \u039b. The service rate is dynamically set\naccording to a T -threshold policy. Specifically, the service rate is set to \u03bcl whenever the number\nof customers in the system is less than or equal to T , and equal to \u03bch otherwise, where \u03bcl < \u03bch .\nThere are no switching costs. Thus, the service policy is defined by the parameters (T, \u03bcl , \u03bch ),\nwhich are known to all arriving customers.\nArriving customers are assumed identical. They make the decision whether to join or balk upon\narrival, in order to maximize their expected net benefit, thus they are assumed risk neutral.\nEvery joining customer receives a fixed reward R \u2265 0 upon service completion, and incurs a\nservice cost rate C > 0 per time unit of delay. In addition, each arriving customer has no\ninformation for the queue length prior to entering the system.\nSince the join decisions of individual customers affect the system delay and thus the benefit of\nall customers, the decision problem corresponds to a symmetric game. We restrict attention to\n4\n\n\fsymmetric Nash equilibrium strategies defined as follows.\nGiven that potential customers are not aware of the actual system state, an arriving customer\nhas two pure strategies, either to join the system or balk. However, for the equilibrium analysis,\nmixed strategies also have to be considered. A mixed strategy is defined by p \u2208 [0, 1], the\nprobability of joining the system, where for p = 0, or 1 it reduces to a pure strategy.\nLet U (p; q) denote a tagged customer's expected net benefit from using mixed strategy p, when\nall others adopt mixed strategy q. Then, a mixed strategy q e is a symmetric Nash equilibrium\nstrategy, if U (q e , q e ) \u2265 U (q, q e ) for any mixed strategy q \u2208 [0, 1]. The intuition is that an\nequilibrium strategy is the best response against itself, so if all customers agree to follow mixed\nstrategy q e , no one can benefit from changing it.\nUnder a mixed strategy q arrivals follow a Poisson process with effective arrival rate \u03bb = \u039bq.\nThe corresponding equilibrium arrival rate is denoted by \u03bbe = \u039b * q e , where q e is a symmetric\nequilibrium strategy. In addition, the customer's expected net benefit is equal to\nU (p; q) = p [R \u2212 CW (\u039bq)] ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere W (\u03bb) denotes the total sojourn time of a customer in the system, as a function of the\neffective arrival rate \u03bb, assuming \u03bb < \u03bch , in order to ensure stability.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we refer to W (\u03bb) as the waiting time or the delay function and,\nwithout loss of generality, we normalize \u03bch = 1 and C = 1.\nAn alternative decision framework could be defined by assuming that all customer decisions are\ncontrolled by a central planner, who enforces a mixed strategy q with the objective of maximizing\nthe overall expected net benefit per unit time. This corresponds to the social welfare optimization\nproblem.\nGiven that a common strategy q corresponds to a Poisson arrival rate \u03bb = \u039bq, the welfare\nfunction can be defined in terms of \u03bb as\nS(\u03bb) = \u03bb [R \u2212 W (\u03bb)] for \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1)\n\n(2)\n\nand an arrival rate \u03bb\u2217 is socially optimal if\nS(\u03bb\u2217 ) = max S(\u03bb).\n\n(3)\n\n\u03bb\u2208[0,1)\n\nIn general the equilibrium and optimal arrival rates rates do not coincide.\nIn the following sections we analyze the equilibrium and social optimization problems and their\nrelationship.\nIn the remainder of this section we derive the expression for the delay function W (\u03bb).\nAn unobservable M |M |1 queue under a T-threshold service policy and a common mixed strategy\nq for all customers corresponds to a standard birth and death process with arrival rates \u03bbn =\n5\n\n\f(\n\u03bb = \u039bq, n \u2208 N and departure rates \u03bcn =\n\n\u03bcl , n \u2264 T\n, n \u2208 N\u2217 , where n refers to the number\n1, n > T\n\nof customers in the system.\nUsing standard queueing analysis, we derive the following expression for the waiting time\nW (\u03bb) =\n\n1\nT\n\u03bcl \u2212\u03bb {\u03bcl\n\n\u2212 (T + 1)\u03bbT +\n\n\u03bb\nT\n\u03bcl \u2212\u03bb (\u03bcl\n\n\u03bclT +1 \u2212\u03bbT +1\n\u03bcl \u2212\u03bb\n\n+\n\n\u2212 \u03bbT )} +\n\n\u03bbT (T +1\u2212T \u03bb)\n(1\u2212\u03bb)2\n\n\u03bbT +1\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nfor \u03bb \u2208 [0, \u03bcl ) \u222a (\u03bcl , 1).\nAn analogous expression of W (\u03bb) can be obtained for the case \u03bb = \u03bcl . After simplification both\nexpressions can be reduced to the following, in which the denominator is strictly positive in\n\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1):\n(\u03bcl \u2212 \u03bb)2 g(\u03bb)\ng(\u03bb)\nW (\u03bb) =\n=\n, for any \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1),\n(5)\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03bcl \u2212 \u03bb) d(\u03bb)\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)d(\u03bb)\nwhere\ng(\u03bb) = \u2212(T \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\u03bbT\n\u2212(1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\n\nT\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bcj\u22121\n[(T \u2212 (j + 1))\u03bcl + j \u2212 1 \u2212 T ] \u03bbT \u2212j + \u03bcTl \u22121\nl\n\n(6)\n\nj=1\n\nand\nd(\u03bb) = (1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\n\nT\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u03bcjl \u03bbT \u2212j + \u03bcTl .\n\n(7)\n\nj=0\n\nNote that, W (0) =\n\n1\n\u03bcl\n\n> 0 and lim\u03bb\u21921\u2212 W (\u03bb) = +\u221e.\n\nIn addition, using (5) we obtain a lower bound for the waiting time:\nW (\u03bb) >\n\n1\n,\n1\u2212\u03bb\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the right-hand side is the expected waiting time in an M |M |1 queue with service rate\nequal to 1.\n\n3\n\nEquilibrium Analysis\n\nIn this section, we identify the equilibrium strategies under individual customer behavior.\nUsing the standard methodology of equilibrium analysis in\nunobservable queueing models (see Hassin & Haviv (2003) p. 46-47), we derive from (1) the\nfollowing equilibria:\n1\n\u2265 R.\n(9)\n\u03bbe = 0 if and only if W (0) =\n\u03bcl\n\n6\n\n\fNote that, when R < 1, 0 is the unique symmetric equilibrium, because of (8). Similarly,\n\u03bbe = \u039b if and only if W (\u039b) < R.\n\n(10)\n\nIn addition, a necessary and sufficient condition, for \u03bbe = \u039bq e \u2208 (0, 1) to be an equilibrium\narrival rate is that\nU (q e ; \u03bbe ) = 0, or equivalently, W (\u03bbe ) = R.\n(11)\nThus, the problem of identifying symmetric equilibria other than the extreme \u03bbe = 0 or \u039b, is\nequivalent to finding the solutions of the equation\nW (\u03bb) = R, in \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1), for R \u2265 1.\n\n(12)\n\nIn the following we assume without loss of generality that the external arrival rate \u039b \u2265 1, in\norder to identify all possible equilibrium arrival rates \u03bbe in the interval [0, 1). In the case where\n\u039b < 1, some of these equilibria may be excluded and instead we must also consider \u039b as a\npossible equilibrium arrival rate.\nFrom the properties of the delay function W (\u03bb) we derive the following lemma.\nLemma 1 If R >\n\n1\n\u03bcl ,\n\nthen the equation W (\u03bb) = R has at least one solution in \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1).\n\nProof From the divergence of W (\u03bb) to infinity as \u03bb \u2192 1\u2212 , we derive that for any R \u2265 1, there\nexists an arrival rate \u03bb0 \u2208 (0, 1) such that W (\u03bb0 ) \u2265 R.\nIn addition, W (0) =\n\u03bb \u2208 [0, \u03bb0 ].\n\n1\n\u03bcl\n\n< R and the result follows readily from the continuity of W (\u03bb) in\n\nFrom Lemma 1, it follows that for R > \u03bc1l there exists at least one positive equilibrium arrival\nrate. On the other hand, extensive numerical analysis for different values of the parameters\nR, T and \u03bcl has shown that there are at most three symmetric equilibria \u03bbe \u2208 (0, 1).\nThis observation is consistent with the behavior of the delay function W (\u03bb), as demonstrated\nin Figure 1 for two typical cases of T -threshold policies (T, \u03bcl , 1). In both plots, we observe that\nW (\u03bb) increases for low and high values of \u03bb, whereas for intermediate values of \u03bb, it decreases.\nIntuitively, this is happening because for small and large values of \u03bb, the system spends almost\nall time in the low or high service rate state, respectively, and the delay is approximately that\nof an M |M |1 queue with the corresponding value of \u03bc.\nOn the other hand, for intermediate values of \u03bb, the service rate switch occurs more often. In\nthis case, increasing \u03bb increases the rate of arrival to the queue, but at the same time forces the\nserver to work faster and the net effect may be a decrease in the overall delay.\nBecause of the non-monotone behavior of W (\u03bb), the number of roots of (12) may vary from 0\nto 3, depending on the values of R, T and \u03bcl .\nFor example in Figure 1(a), for R = 9, there are three equilibrium arrival rates, one of which\nequal to zero, while in Figure 1(b) for R = 21, there are three strictly positive equilibria.\n7\n\n\f(b)\n\n20\n5\n\n8\n\n10\n\n10\n\n15\n\nW(\u03bb)\n\n12\n\nW(\u03bb)\n\n14\n\n25\n\n30\n\n16\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03bb\n\nFigure 1: The expected waiting time, W (\u03bb), for (a)T = 3, \u03bcl =\n\n1\n10\n\nand (b)T = 10, \u03bcl =\n\n1\n5\n\nNote that this discussion is solely based on observation of the delay function graph for different\nnumerical values. The complexity of the expressions does not allow the study of W (\u03bb) directly.\nWe instead resort to the following equivalent polynomial equation of degree T + 1, derived by\nsubstituting (5) in (12).\nH(\u03bb) = \u2212R(1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\u03bbT +1 + (1 \u2212 \u03bcl )(R(1 \u2212 \u03bcl ) + T \u2212 1)\u03bbT\n+(1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\n\nT\n\u22121\nX\n\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03bclT \u22121\u2212j \u2212R\u03bc2 + (R + j \u2212 1)\u03bc \u2212 (j + 1) \u03bbj\n\n(13)\n\nj=2\n\n+\u03bcTl \u22122 (\u22122R\u03bc2l + (R + 2)\u03bcl \u2212 2)\u03bb + \u03bcTl \u22121 (R\u03bcl \u2212 1) = 0.\nIn general, the roots of (13) cannot be analytically expressed as a function of the parameters\nT, \u03bcl and R. Furthermore, the number of roots and thus of equilibria can be as high as T + 1.\nHowever we apply analytic techniques to bound the number of roots.\nSpecifically, we will make use of the following result in analysis, referred to in the literature as\nBudan's Rule.\nTheorem 1 (Budan's Rule, Wilf (1962) p.94)\nThe number of zeros of a polynomial equation\nf (x) = \u03b10 + \u03b11 x + \u03b12 x2 + * * * + \u03b1n xn\nin (a, b) is either equal to V (a) \u2212 V (b) or less by an even number, where V (x) is the number of\nvariations of sign in the sequence (f (x), f 0 (x), * * * f (n) (x)).\n8\n\n\fIn our case, let V (\u03bb) be the number of sign variations in the sequence\n(H(\u03bb), H 0 (\u03bb), * * * , H (T +1) (\u03bb)). Based on this theorem we can show the following result.\nProposition 1 For any R \u2265 1,\ni. V (0) \u2264 3\nii. The polynomial equation H(\u03bb) = 0 has at most three roots in \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1).\nProof i. By definition, V (0) is the number of variations of sign in the sequence\n(H(0), H 0 (0), . . . , H (n) (0), . . . , H (T +1) (0)), where H (n) (0) = n!\u03b7n for n = 0, . . . , T + 1 and \u03b7n\ndenotes the coefficient of \u03bbn in polynomial H(\u03bb).\nSince R \u2265 1 and \u03bcl \u2208 (0, 1), we obtain the following.\nFirst,\n\u03b7T +1 = \u2212R(1 \u2212 \u03bcl ) < 0, therefore H (T +1) (0) = (T + 1)!\u03b7T +1 < 0.\n\n(14)\n\n\u03b7T = (1 \u2212 \u03bcl )(R(1 \u2212 \u03bcl ) + T \u2212 1) > 0, and thus H (T ) (0) = T !\u03b7T > 0.\n\n(15)\n\nAlso,\n\nIn order to derive the sign of coefficients \u03b7j for j = 2, . . . , T \u2212 1, we let\nf (j) = \u2212R\u03bc2l + (R \u2212 1)\u03bcl \u2212 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bcl )j\n\n(16)\n\nH (j) (0) = j!(1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\u03bcTl \u22121\u2212j f (j).\n\n(17)\n\nand rewrite H (j) (0) as\n\nSince f (j) is decreasing in j, there exists at most one sign variation in f (j) for j \u2208 {2 . . . T \u2212 1}.\nThus, there exists j0 \u2208 {2 . . . T }, such that for any j = 2, . . . , T , f (j) \u2265 0 if j < j0 and f (j) < 0\nif j \u2265 j0 . In the following sign analysis of H (j) (0), 0 will be considered as positive. We consider\nthree cases for j0 :\n1. If j0 = 2, then H (j) (0) < 0 for any j \u2208 {2, . . . , T \u2212 1}.\n2. If j0 = T , then H (j) (0) > 0 for any j \u2208 {2, . . . , T \u2212 1}.\n3. If j0 \u2208 {3 . . . , T \u2212 1}, then H (j) (0) > 0 for j < j0 and H (j) (0) < 0 for j \u2265 j0 .\nFor each of these, there are four subcases depending on the signs of H 0 (0) and H(0):\na.

From (13), we obtain that\n\u22122R\u03bc2l + (R + 2)\u03bcl \u2212 2 > 0 and R\u03bcl \u2212 1 < 0.\nHowever,\n\u22122R\u03bc2l + (R + 2)\u03bcl \u2212 2 = (R\u03bcl \u2212 1) \u2212 (2R\u03bc2l + 1 \u2212 \u03bcl ) < R\u03bcl \u2212 1,\nwhich is a contradiction. Thus subcase b is excluded and V (0) \u2264 3.\nii. Since V (1) \u2265 0, we obtain that V (0)\u2212V (1) \u2264 3, thus the result follows readily from Theorem\n1.\nWe can further observe from the Proof of Proposition 1, that if subcase d holds, then V (0) \u2264 2,\nthus, the upper bound on the number of roots of H(\u03bb) is reduced by one.\nIn the next Corollary we provide sufficient condition for this sharper bound to hold.\nCorollary 1 If 1 \u2264 R <\n\n1\n\u03bcl ,\n\nthen H(\u03bb) has at most two roots in (0, 1).\n\nProof If 1 \u2264 R < \u03bc1l , it follows that \u03b70 = \u03bcTl \u22121 (R\u03bcl \u2212 1) < 0 and \u03b71 = \u03bcTl \u22122 (\u22122R\u03bc2l + (R +\n2)\u03bcl \u2212 2) < 0. Thus, subcase d holds and V (0) = 2.\n10\n\n\fFrom Corollary 1 and Proposition 1 it follows that the equation H(\u03bb) = 0 has at most three\nroots in (0, 1), for R \u2265 \u03bc1l .\nIn the following Theorem we summarize the equilibrium analysis of our model.\nThe proof is immediate from (9), (10), Lemma 1, Proposition 1 and Corollary 1.\nTheorem 2 For \u039b \u2265 1:\ni. If R < 1, the unique equilibrium arrival rate is \u03bbe = 0.\nii. If 1 \u2264 R \u2264\niii. If R >\n\n1\n\u03bcl ,\n\n1\n\u03bcl ,\n\nthen \u03bbe = 0 and in addition there may exist at most two positive equilibria.\n\nthen there exist at least one and at most three positive equilibria.\n\nThe existence of more than one symmetric equilibria is due to the non-monotone behavior of\nthe delay function W (\u03bb), as discussed previously.\nAlso, it is worth noting that when multiple equilibria exist, then some of them are stable, in the\nsense that a small perturbation of \u03bb will not affect system convergence to the equilibrium rate,\nwhile others are not.\nFor example, in Figure 1(a), there exist three equilibrium arrival rates, of which 0 and \u03bbe2 are\nstable. On the other hand, \u03bbe1 is unstable, because a small increase in \u03bb decreases the expected\nwaiting time and more customers are encouraged to join. This further increases the arrival rate,\nthus the arrival rate moves away from \u03bbe1 . Similar observations can be made for the example\nillustrated in Figure 1(b). In this case there exist three strictly positive equilibria, with \u03bbe2 being\nunstable, as it corresponds to the decreasing part of W (\u03bb). Finally, in both examples, for values\nof R greater than the minimum value of W (\u03bb), the maximum equilibrium arrival rate is always\nstable.\n\n4\n\nSocial Optimization\n\nIn this section, we analyze the problem of social welfare optimization, where the decision problem\nfor a central planner is to obtain a socially optimal strategy \u03bb\u2217 , which maximizes customers'\noverall expected net benefit per unit time S(\u03bb), as defined in (3).\nFrom (5), the social welfare function can be expressed as\n\u0014\n\u0015\ng(\u03bb)\nS(\u03bb) = \u03bb R \u2212\n, for \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1),\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)d(\u03bb)\nwhere g(\u03bb) and d(\u03bb) are defined in (6) and (7), respectively.\n\n11\n\n(18)\n\n\fFrom (18), S(\u03bb) is continuous and differentiable in (0, 1), thus, the first-order condition for the\nmaximization problem is\nS 0 (\u03bb) = 0 \u21d4 R \u2212 W (\u03bb) \u2212 \u03bbW 0 (\u03bb) = 0.\n\n(19)\n\nAn analytic characterization of the optimal solution based on (19) is not tractable because of\nthe complexity of the expressions of W (\u03bb) and W 0 (\u03bb). We thus resort to numerical analysis in\norder to explore the behavior the optimal arrival rate \u03bb\u2217 and its relationship to the equilibrium\narrival rates.\nMore specifically, we examine how the equilibrium and optimal arrival rates are affected by\nchanging the values of parameters T , \u03bcl and R. Since, in general, the equilibrium arrival\nrate is not unique, in the diagrams we show the minimum and maximum equilibrium arrival\nrates, denoted as \u03bbemin and \u03bbemax respectively, and where the socially optimal arrival rate lies\nwith respect to the range of individual equilibria. In addition, we examine the behavior of the\nmaximum social benefit S(\u03bb\u2217 ) with respect to the same parameters.\nIn the beginning, we present numerical results with respect to the service threshold T , which is\nan easily controlled operational characteristic of the system. We next proceed to the sensitivity\nanalysis with respect to parameters R and \u03bcl , for specific values of the service threshold. We\nconsider the cases T = 10 and T = 3, the same as those used for the graphs of the delay function\nW (\u03bb), in Figure 1.\nIn Figure 2 we present the results of the sensitivity analysis with respect to the service threshold\nT , for \u03bcl = 41 and R = 25. We observe that the equilibrium and optimal arrival rates are\ndecreasing in T . This is expected because higher values of the service threshold increase the\ntime that the server spends in the low rate and customers decision to join leads to increased\ndelays due to system congestion, discouraging more customers from joining.\nMoreover, for low and high values of T , the system behaves approximately as an M |M |1 queue\nwith service rate equal to \u03bcl , and 1, respectively. Therefore, for such T values the equilibrium\narrival rate is unique and the optimal arrival rate is lower than the equilibrium because of\nthe negative externalities. On the other hand, for intermediate values of T there are multiple\nequilibria, as discussed in Section 3. In these cases the optimal rate is between the two extreme\nvalues \u03bbemin and \u03bbemax of the equilibrium. Thus, whether the externalities are positive or negative,\nand thus whether a tax or a subsidy is required to induce efficiency, is not known in advance\nbut it depends on which of the equilibrium rates will materialize. Finally, we observe in Figure\n2 that the maximum social benefit S(\u03bb\u2217 ) is decreasing in T for fixed values of R and \u03bcl , as a\nconsequence of the behavior of the optimal arrival rate with respect to T .\nNext, we proceed to numerical results with respect to parameters R and \u03bcl , considering first the\ncase of T = 10. Using the dynamic service policy (T, \u03bcl , 1) for T = 10 and \u03bcl = 15 , we obtain\n\u03bb\u2217 and the corresponding equilibria with respect to R, which are illustrated in Figure 3. Note\nthat, the equilibrium analysis for this service policy has been presented in Figure 1(b) and, thus,\nboth diagrams must be considered together, in order to explore the relationship between \u03bb\u2217 and\n12\n\n\fthe equilibria. We see that, \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbemax for low and high values of the reward, in which case the\nequilibrium arrival rate is unique, as showed in Figure 1(b). On the other hand, for intermediate\nvalues of R, where there exist two or three equilibria, we observe that \u03bbemin \u2264 \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbemax . In\nthis case, customers can impose either positive or negative externalities in equilibrium, as we\nmentioned before.\nRegarding the sensitivity of the social optimal arrival rate and the corresponding equilibria\nwith respect to the low service rate for R = 20, which is presented in Figure 4, we see that\n\u03bbemin \u2264 \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbemax for low values of \u03bcl , whereas \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbemax for higher values. This happens\nbecause the service rate switch option is no longer beneficial for joining customers, as the low\nservice rate increases to high values. Therefore, the expected waiting time becomes monotone\nincreasing as \u03bcl increases, corresponding to the delay function of a typical M |M |1 queue, which\nresults in the existence of a unique equilibrium strategy with rate larger than \u03bb\u2217 .\nMoreover in both figures, we observe that there exist a discontinuity point with respect to R or\n\u03bcl , which corresponds to the existence of two equal maxima for different values of the reward or\nthe low service rate, respectively. This is due to the fact that the social benefit function S(\u03bb)\ncan be bimodal for some values of R or \u03bcl .\nConsidering the behavior of \u03bb\u2217 as well as both equilibria, we observe that they are increasing in\nR, which is intuitive considering the fact that customers either as a whole or acting independently\nare generally better off as the reward increases, and, thus tend to join more. This is also reflected\nin the behavior of the maximum social benefit S(\u03bb\u2217 ), which is always increasing in R, as observed\nin Figure 3.\nIn contrast, regarding the behavior of the social optimal arrival rate with respect to \u03bcl , we\nobserve in Figure 4 that it is slightly decreasing for small values, and, then becomes increasing,\nafter a discontinuity jump. For this set of values of T, R, \u03bcl the social benefit function is\nbimodal in \u03bb, with two local maxima. Of these the lower corresponds to a policy that accepts\na small proportion of customers and thus keeps delay low by avoiding congestion.\nThe other local maximum occurs at a higher value of \u03bb, which means that more customers\nare accepted, so the server is forced to work at the high rate most of the time, thus keeping\nthe delay moderate. For every value of \u03bcl one of the two local maxima supersedes the other\nand determines the optimal value of \u03bb. For small values of \u03bcl the lower mode value is so low\nthat almost no one is accepted, thus the higher mode is preferred. On the other hand as \u03bcl\nincreases, the delay becomes more moderate even when the server works at low rate, which\nmakes the lower mode preferred. The discontinuity point corresponds to the value of \u03bcl where\nthe two local maxima are equal. As \u03bcl increases above the discontinuity point, the low mode\nstill persists but nevertheless more customers are accepted under the optimal policy.\nNote that regardless of the non-monotone behavior of \u03bb\u2217 , the optimal welfare value S(\u03bb\u2217 ) is\nincreasing in \u03bcl , since higher values of this service rate can only improve system performance.\n\n13\n\n\fEquilibrium and Socially Optimal Points\n\nMaximum Social Benefit\n\n14\n12\n10\n8\n2\n\n0.0\n\n4\n\n0.2\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bb\n\nS(\u03bb*)\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03bbemin\n\u03bbemax\n\u03bb*\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\nT\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nT\n\nFigure 2: Equilibrium and Socially Optimal rates as a function of T for R = 25, \u03bcl = 14 .\n1\nSimilar observations can be made for the case T = 3. For \u03bcl = 10\nand varying R, we observe\n\u2217\ne\ne\nin Figure 5 that \u03bb \u2264 \u03bbmax for R < 7 and R > 16, whereas \u03bbmin \u2264 \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbemax for intermediate\nvalues of R. Moreover, regarding the behavior of the social optimal arrival rate, \u03bb\u2217 has a\ndiscontinuity point in R = 7. This can be explained by an analogous bimodality argument as in\nthe previous case. In addition, the social optimal arrival rate \u03bb\u2217 , as well as the social optimal\nbenefit S(\u03bb\u2217 ), are increasing in R as expected.\n\nWe finally note that the discontinuities discussed above do not always occur. For other sets of\nvalues of T, R, \u03bcl , the social welfare function may be unimodal in \u03bb, or even if it is bimodal one\nof the two modes may persist as optimal. In these cases the optimal arrival rate is continuous\nand monotone in the corresponding parameter. For example Figure 6, shows the dependence on\n\u03bcl for T = 3 and R = 5, where there exists a unique equilibrium for any \u03bcl , which is continuous\nand increasing in \u03bcl , as is also the socially optimal rate. In this case, the equilibrium is always\ngreater than the socially optimal rate, whenever they take non-zero\n\n5\n\nThe Case T = 1\n\nIn this section, we analyze the case where the service threshold T is set to 1 and, thus the service\npolicy prescribes that the server uses the low rate as long as the queue is empty and switches\nto the high rate as soon as a customer joins the queue.\nThis policy may be appropriate when there is a large difference between the two service rate\nvalues, and an assurance must be given to the customers that when there is at least one person\n\n14\n\n\f0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0\n\n5\n\n\u03bbeemin\n\u03bb max\n\u03bb*\n\nMaximum Social Benefit\n10 15 20 25\n\nS(\u03bb*)\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nEquilibrium and Socially Optimal Points\n\n50\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nR\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nR\n\nFigure 3: Equilibrium and Socially Optimal rates as a function of R for T = 10,\u03bcl = 15 .\n\nMaximum Social Benefit\n\n0.0 0.2\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n8\n2\n\n4\n\n\u03bbeemin\n\u03bb max\n\u03bb*\n\n6\n\n0.4\n\nS(\u03bb*)\n\n0.6\n\n10\n\n0.8\n\n12\n\nEquilibrium and Socially Optimal Points\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bcl\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u03bcl\n\nFigure 4: Equilibrium and Socially Optimal rates as a function of \u03bcl for T = 10, R = 20.\n\n15\n\n\fMaximum Social Benefit\n\n\u03bbemax\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n0\n\n\u03bb*\n0\n\n20\n5 10\n\n\u03bbemin\n\nS(\u03bb*)\n\n30\n\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\nEquilibrium and Socially Optimal Points\n\n50\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nR\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nR\n\nFigure 5: Equilibrium and Socially Optimal rates as a function of R for T = 3, \u03bcl =\n\nMaximum Social Benefit\n\n0.2\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\nS(\u03bb*)\n\n0.6\n\n1.5\n\n0.8\n\nEquilibrium and Socially Optimal Points\n\n1\n10 .\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bbemin = \u03bbem\n\u03bb*\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n\u03bcl\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n\u03bcl\n\nFigure 6: Equilibrium and Socially Optimal rates as a function of \u03bcl for T = 3, R = 5.\n\n16\n\n\f(b)\n\n10\n\nW(\u03bb)\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nW(\u03bb)\n\n8\n\n15\n\n10\n\n20\n\n(a)\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03bb\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n\u03bb\n\nFigure 7: The expected waiting time W (\u03bb) for T = 1 and (a)\u03bcl <\n\n1\n2\n\nor (b)\u03bcl >\n\n1\n2\n\nwaiting in the queue the service is expedited.\nFrom the analysis point of view the expressions of the delay function is now considerably simpler,\npermitting more complete analytical results.\nAs in the general model, we first characterize the symmetric equilibrium strategies and then\nproceed to social benefit maximization.\nFor T = 1, the delay function in (5) becomes\nW1 (\u03bb) =\n\n1\n, \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1).\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)[\u03bcl + \u03bb(1 \u2212 \u03bcl )]\n\n(20)\n\nIn the following lemma we present some properties of the delay function W1 (\u03bb).

If \u03bc > 21 , W1 (\u03bb) is increasing and convex in \u03bb \u2208 [0, 1), as stated in Lemma 2. By (28), it\nfollows that S100 (\u03bb) < 0 \u2200\u03bb \u2208 [0, 1), and the statement holds.\nii. The expression of S10 (\u03bb) in (27) can be rewritten as\nS10 (\u03bb) = \u2212\n\nH1 (\u03bb)\n\u2212 \u03bbW10 (\u03bb)\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb)(\u03bcl + (1 \u2212 \u03bcl )\u03bb)\n\n(29)\n\nwhere H1 (\u03bb) is the polynomial in (21).\nNow, for \u03bcl = 1 \u2212 R4 < 12 , we obtain that H1 (\u03bb) > 0, \u2200\u03bb \u2208 [0, \u03bbe0 ) \u222a (\u03bbe0 , 1). Also, W1 (\u03bb)\nis increasing in \u03bb \u2208 (\u03bbe0 , 1). By (29) and (28) we obtain that S10 (\u03bb) < 0 and S100 (\u03bb) < 0 for\n\u03bb \u2208 (\u03bbe0 , 1). Thus, S1 (\u03bb) is decreasing and concave in \u03bb \u2208 (\u03bbe0 , 1).\n19\n\n\fiii. Similarly to ii. it can be shown that S1 (\u03bb) is decreasing and concave in \u03bb \u2208 (\u03bbe1 , 1).\nIn the following proposition we prove a result on the relationship between the optimal and\nequilibrium arrival rates. In this case, \u03bbe refers to a positive and stable equilibrium arrival rate.\n\nProposition 2 For any \u03bcl \u2208 (0, 1) and R \u2265 1 there exists an equilibrium \u03bbe such that \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbe\nfor any social optimal arrival rate \u03bb\u2217 \u2208 [0, 1).\nProof In order to prove the statement of Proposition 2 we consider the cases of Lemma 3 for\nthe value of \u03bcl .\nFirst, assume \u03bcl > 21 . By the concavity of the social welfare function S1 (\u03bb), as stated in Lemma\n3, it follows that there exists a unique social optimal arrival rate \u03bb\u2217 , which maximizes S1 (\u03bb).\nIn addition, if \u03bcl \u2264 R1 the unique equilibrium arrival rate is \u03bbe = 0 with S10 (0) = R \u2212 W (0) =\nR \u2212 \u03bc1l \u2264 0. Thus, S10 (0) \u2264 S10 (\u03bb\u2217 ) and by the monotonicity of S10 (\u03bb) we obtain that \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 0,\nwhich results to \u03bb\u2217 = 0. If, on the contrary, \u03bcl > R1 , the unique equilibrium arrival rate is\n\u03bbe = \u03bbe1 with S10 (\u03bbe1 ) < 0. Once again, by the monotonicity of S10 (\u03bb) we prove that \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbe for\nany \u03bb\u2217 .\nNext, we consider the case where \u03bcl = 1 \u2212 R4 < 12 . By Lemma 3, we obtain that S1 (\u03bb) is\ndecreasing and concave in \u03bb \u2208 (\u03bbe0 , 1). Thus, \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbe0 for any \u03bb\u2217 , where \u03bbe0 is the stable and\npositive equilibrium arrival rate, as stated in Proposition 3.\nFinally, for the case of 1 \u2212 R4 < \u03bcl < 12 , it follows similarly that \u03bb\u2217 \u2264 \u03bbe1 for any optimal arrival\nrate \u03bb\u2217 , where \u03bbe1 is the stable positive equilibrium arrival rate.\n\n6\n\nConclusions and Extensions\n\nIn this paper, we considered the problem of customer equilibrium joining behavior in an unobservable M |M |1 queue with dynamically adjusted service rate according to a threshold type\nservice policy, known to all customers. We proved that there exist multiple equilibria, three at\nmost, due to the presence of both positive and negative externalities for different values of the\neffective arrival rate. For the social welfare optimization problem, we explored the relationship\nbetween the optimal and the equilibrium arrival rates in several numerical experiments for different values of system parameters. We demonstrated that in cases where there exist multiple\nequilibria, the socially optimal point lies between the extreme equilibrium values, whereas in all\nother cases it is always less than the equilibrium arrival rate.\nThis work can be extended in several directions. First, it would be of interest to determine the\nequilibrium strategies under different levels of information on system congestion or the status\n20\n\n\fof the server upon customer arrival. Some preliminary work has shown that the equilibrium\nanalysis in these problems is significantly more complex, and non-threshold equilibria may exist.\nIn terms of the form of the service control policy, one might consider an alternative where instead\nof increasing the service speed with congestion, one or more standby servers are activated. Such\na policy is more relevant in situations where the service is provided by human workers. Other\nextensions include generally distributed service requirements and dynamic service speed, series of\nqueues with different parameters and/or service policies, and systems where the specific service\npolicy threshold is not announced to the customers.\n\nReferences\nAdusumilli, K. & Hasenbein, J.
