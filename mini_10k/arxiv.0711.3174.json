For a more comprehensive account with\nmany more references, see [1].\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nRecords play a role in Quantum Cosmology and Quantum Gravity. The literature on this is a heterogeneous, consisting of 1) reinterpretations [2, 3] of\nhow \u03b1-particle tracks form in a bubble chamber [4] that may be analogous to\nQuantum Cosmology [5, 6, 7, 8]. Therein, Barbour's approach also involves\nreformulating classical physics in timeless terms [10, 9, 11, 12] and places\nemphasis on the configuration of the universe as a whole and on timelessness\ncasting mystery [3] upon why 'ordinary physics' works. 2) The Conditional\nProbabilities Interpretation for Quantum Cosmology [13, 14, 15] places its\nemphasis on subconfigurations (SC's) of the universe within a single instant.\nHere, ordinary physics of SC's ends up familiarly explained through other\nSC's providing approximate time standards for them, and what is habitually\nobserved is the dynamics of subsystems rather than of the whole universe\n[19, 9, 3, 20]. 3) While Histories Theory (see e.g. [17]) is not primarily timeless, a Records Theory sits within it [17, 18], and benefits from inheriting\npart of the structural framework developed for Histories Theory.\nRecords are \"somewhere in the universe that information\nis stored when histories decohere\" (p 3353 of [17]) .\n(0)\nThis seminar's Records Theory is a synthesis of elements drawn from 1\nto 3. In outline, I consider records to be information-containing SC's of a\nsingle instant. Records Theory is then the study of these and how dynamics\n1\n\n\f(or history or science) is to be abstracted from correlations between sameinstant records. It is to make this abstraction meaningful that I insist on\nrecords being SC's rather than whole instants, thus getting round the abovementioned 'mystery' by a similar argument to the Conditional Probability\nInterpretation's.\nFor adopting a Records Theory approach to profitable, I argue that\nrecords should have the following properties. Useability, in that A) their\nwhereabouts [c.f. (0)] should be spatially-localized SC's of the universe,\nfor whatever notion of space that one's theory has and restricted to the\nobservationally accessible part thereof. B) They should also belong to a\npart of the SC space for which observational imprecisions in identifying\nSC's do not distort the extraction of information too much Usefulness: their\ninformation content [c.f. (0)] should be high enough and of the right sort\nof quality to enable reliable measures of correlation to be computed. Not\nall systems have instants solely of this nature, so Records Theory may not\nalways be profitable. 1) and 2) additionally require semblance of dynamics\nto emerge from timeless records.\nSec 2 summarizes motivation for Records Theory. Sec 3 mentions some\nillustrative toy models. Sec 4 proposes a ground-level structure for Records\nTheory which parallels some of that of Histories Theory. I then comment\non the useability, usefulness and correlation aspects of records in Sec 4\u20136,\nand more speculative aspects in Sec 7.\n\n2\n\nSome motivations for Records Theory\n\nRecords Theory should be motivated as follows [1]. 1) The Problem of\nTime (POT) in Quantum Gravity is an incompatibility between the roles\nplayed by 'time' in GR and in QM [16]. One conceptually clear way of\ndealing with this problem is to recast both GR and QM in a timeless mold.\n[While the Wheeler\u2013DeWitt equation (WDE)'s timelessness might specifically prompt some physicists toward Timeless Records Theory, this equation\nhas numerous technical problems and may not be trustworthy. Despite e.g.\n[19, 9, 3], nor should one turn to Timeless Records Theory due to earlier\ndetailed documentation of problems with the other POT approaches, but\nrather judge it due to its own merits and shortcomings (Sec 7).] 2) One can\nin principle treat all of change, processes, dynamics, history and the scientific enterprise in these timeless terms. The classification and subsequent\npartial elimination of question types in this seminar is to demonstrate that\n(and its impracticality in some cases). 3) Records Theory is of potential use\nin removing some unclarities (see e.g. [6]) from the foundations of Quantum Cosmology (which in turn is what Inflationary Theory is to rest on).\n2\n\n\fRecords Theory makes contact with this area in e.g. the following ways.\nA) Such as CMB inhomogeneities or the pattern and spectra of galaxies\nmay be considered to be useful records. B) Within a histories perspective,\nthe decoherence process makes records, but information is in general lost in\nthe making. E.g. mixed states necessarily produce imperfect records [18].\nFurthermore, finding out where in the universe the information resides (i.e.\nwhere the records are) should be capable of resolving in which cases gravity\ndecoheres matter or vice versa. Decoherence is habitually linked with the\nemergence of (semi)classicality, so there may well be some bridge between\nRecords Theory and the Semiclassical Approach. C) See also Sec 7. 4)\nRecords Theory is (alongside Histories Theory) a universal scheme in that\nall types of theory or system admit a such.\nIt has also been suggested that records are more operationally meaningful than the histories. For, study of records is how one does science (and\nhistory) in practise? Unfortunately, this last suggestion fails as motivation,\nbecause of the difference between the notion of records as in (some of the)\nSC's that the system provides and as in things which are localized, accessible\nand of significant information content. As effective reconstruction of history\nrequires the SC's in question to have these in general unestablished properties, it is a question to address rather than a preliminary motivation to\nhave that records are more operationally meaningful than histories through\npossessing good enough qualities to permit a meaningful such reconstruction. Thus what one should do is 1) pin down where the \"somewhere\" in\n(0) is (the central motivation in some of Halliwell's papers, e.g. [18]). 2)\nDetermine whether the record thereat is useful \u2013 Gell-Mann\u2013Hartle assert\nthat what they call records \"may not represent records in the usual sense\nof being constructed from quasiclassical variables accessible to us\" (p 3353\nof [17]). Also, it may be that the \u03b1-particle track in the bubble chamber is\natypical in its neatness and localization. For, bubble chambers are carefully\nselected environments for revealing tracks \u2013 much human trial and error has\ngone into finding a piece of apparatus that does just that. \u03b1-tracks being\nuseful records could then hinge on this careful pre-selection, records in general then being expected to be (far) poorer, as suggested e.g. by Joos\u2013Zeh's\nparadigm [21] of a dust particle decohering due to the microwave background photons. In this situation, records are exceedingly diffuse as the\ninformation is spread around by the CMB photons.\n\n3\n\nToy models for Records Theory\n\nOrdinary (conservative) mechanics already has a simple analogue of the\nHamiltonian constraint: a homogeneous quadratic energy constraint which\n3\n\n\fgives a time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TISE) analogue of the WDE\nat the quantum level. There are furthemore other mechanics that share\nmore features with GR: relational particle mechanics (RPM's) are such [10,\n20, 23, 24]. These have additional linear constraints [such as a zero angular\nmomentum constraint, the physics then being encoded solely in the relative\nseparations and angles rather than in any absolute angles, in analogy with\nhow the linear momentum constraint of GR is interpretable in terms of\nthe physics being in the shape of 3-space and not in its coordinatization.]\nScale-invariant RPM's additionally have a linear zero dilational constraint\nthat is analogous to the maximal slicing condition in GR. Full reductions\nare available [23] for 2d RPM's (of which the scale-invariant one is better\nbehaved) allowing us to do quite a lot more with these particular models.\nThe kinetic term then contains the positive-definite Fubini\u2013Study metric.\nOne could include a harmonic oscillator detector within one's mechanics\nmodel, or couple it to an up\u2013down detector. These can hold information\nabout one Fourier mode in the signal, thus showing that even very simple\nsystems can make imperfect records [18]. Finally, the inhomogeneous perturbations about homogeneous cosmologies [25] are a more advanced toy\nmodel (with which RPM's nevertheless share various features).\n\n4\n4.1\n\nSC space structure and useable records\nFirst level of classical structure\n\nA configuration Q\u2206 (p) is a set of particle positions and/or field values, where\n\u2206 is a multi-index which covers both particle and field species labels and\nwhatever 'tensorial' indices each of these may carry, and p is a fixed label.\nHierarchical, nonunique splittings into subsystems can then be construed: Q\u0393 (p) is a subsystem of Q\u2206 (p) if \u0393 is a subset of the indexing\nset \u2206. The finest such subdivision is into individual degrees of freedom.\nTwo question-types that may be considered at this level are: Be1\u2032 ),\ndoes Q\u2206 (p) have acceptable properties? (That covers both mathematical\nconsistency and physical reasonableness). Be2\u2032 ) If properties of Q\u2206 (p) are\nknown, does this permit deduction of any observable properties of some\nQ\u2206\u2032 (p) for \u2206\u2032 disjoint from \u2206? In other words, are there observable correlations between SC's of a single instant?\nMany notions and constructions that theoretical physicists use (see e.g.\n[16]) additionally require consideration of sets of instants. A configuration\nspace of instants is Q\u2206 = {Q\u2206 (p) : p a label running over a (generally stratified) manifold }. This is a heap of instants. One defines SC spaces similarly.\nThe counterpart of decomposition into subsystems is now a break-down into\n4\n\n\fsubspaces. An ordinary (absolute) particle mechanics configuration space\nis the set of possible positions of N particles, Q(N, d). Relational configuration space R(N, d) is the set of possible relative separations and relative\nangles between particles. Preshape space P(N, d) is the set of possible scalefree relative particle positions. Shape space S(N, d) is the set of possible\nscale-free relational configurations. As another example, for geometrodynamics, a rather redundant configuration space is Riem(\u03a3): the space of\npositive-definite 3-metrics h\u03bc\u03bd (x\u03b3 ) on the 3-space of fixed topology \u03a3. Less\nredundant ones are superspace(\u03a3) = Riem(\u03a3)/Diff(\u03a3) and (something like)\nconformal superspace(\u03a3) = Riem(\u03a3)/Diff(\u03a3) \u00d7 Conf(\u03a3), for Diff(\u03a3) the\ndiffeomorphisms of \u03a3 and Conf(\u03a3) the conformal transformations of \u03a3.\nWhile each Q\u2206 corresponds to a given model with a fixed list of contents,\none may not know which model a given (e.g. observed) SC belongs to, or the\ntheory may admit operations that alter the list of contents of the universe.\nThen one has a grand heap of SC spaces of instants. For example, use 1)\nS\nN\u2208 N0 Q(N,\nS d) for a mechanics theory that allows for variable particle\nnumber. 2)\nvarious \u03a3 superspace(\u03a3) for a formulation of GR that allows\nfor spatial topology change.\nA second type of hierarchical splitting are grainings: the various ways\nthat Q can be partitioned. These define a partial order \u227a on the subsets of\nQ. A \u227a B is termed 'A is finer grained than B', while C \u227b D is termed 'C\nis coarser-grained than D'. The coarsest grained set is Q itself, while the\nfinest grained sets are each individual q(p) (the constituent points of Q).\nLocalization in space continues to be formulable in the relational context\n[1]. Localization on configuration spaces [1, 27] can sometimes be attained\nby augmenting the configuration space to be equipped with a norm. E.g.\non Q(N, d), these are the obvious unweighted and (inverse) mass-weighted\nRNd norms, which still play a role in more reduced configuration spaces\nthrough these 'inheriting' structures such as the Rnd norm for R(N, d) or\nthe chordal norm for P(N, d). If the configuration space has a natural\nmetric more complicated than the Euclidean one, one might be able to\nextend the above notion to the norm corresponding to that. E.g., one could\nuse the Fubini\u2013Study norm on S(N, 2), or the inverse DeWitt line element\non Riem(\u03a3) (but its indefiniteness causes some problems).\nAnother way is to intrinsically compute on each configuration a finite\ni\nnumber of quantities, i: Q \u2212\u2192 Rn , and then use the Rn norm DEucl\n(Q\u2206 , Q\u2032\u2206 )\n\u2032\n2\n= ||i(Q\u2206 ) \u2212 i(Q\u2206 )|| (though this is limited for some purposes by i having a\nnontrivial kernel). E.g. one can compare SC's in Q(N, d), R(N, d) or R(N,\nd) by letting i be the total moment of inertia for each SC (a mass-weighted\nnorm). In geometrodynamical theories, one could additionally compute geometrical quantities to serve as i, or embed N points in a uniformally random\n\n5\n\n\fway in each geometry and then use the pairwise metric distances between\nthe points to furbish a vectorial i. Or, one could use total volume, anisotropy\nparameter or a vector made out of these, or use curvature invariants such\nas maximal or average curvatures of a given 3-space (e.g. objects related\nto the Weyl tensor which are also perported measures of gravitational information, see Sec 5). Or, for nonhomogeneous GR, one could compute\neigenvalues of an operator D associated with that geometry (e.g. Laplacian or Yano\u2013Bochner operators) and construct a spectral measure i from\nthese. Another measure of inhomogeneity that could be used as an i would\nbe an energy density contrast type quantity F[\u03b5/h\u03b5i] (for \u03b5 the energy densityDdistribution\n\u0010 \u0011Eand h i denoting average over some volume) such as \u03b5/h\u03b5i\n\u03b5\nh\u03b5i log\n\nor\n\n\u03b5\nh\u03b5i\n\n, which particular functional form [22] also has informa-\n\ntion content connotations (see Sec 6). One can readily supply a notion of\n'within \u01eb of' for each above structure (contingent to what distance axioms\nit obeys), thus obtaining examples of grainings. RPM's with their local\nparticle clusters, and inhomogeneous perturbations about minisuperspace\nwith their localized bumps, are two such settings.\nFour further question types can then be addressed. Two generalize their\nprimed counterparts to model the imperfection of observation. Be1), does\nq\u2206 (P ) have acceptable properties? This is now for a graining set P rather\nthan for an individual instant p. Be2), if properties of q\u2206 (P ) are known,\ndoes this permit deduction of any properties of q\u2206\u2032 (P ) for \u2206\u2032 disjoint from\n\u2206? The other two involve the Q space of the theory or theories that the\nobservations are perported to belong to. BeS1) is: what is P(q\u2206 (P )) within\nthe collection of SC spaces? BeS2) is: what is P(q\u2206\u2032 (P ) has properties\nP \u2032 |q\u2206 (P ) has properties P)?1 Examples of such questions are: what is\nP(space is almost flat)? What is P(space is almost isotropic)? What is\nP(space is almost homogeneous)?\n\n4.2\n\nConfiguration comparers and decorated instants\n\nThe above single-configuration notion of closeness may not suffice for some\npurposes (whether in principle or through lack of mathematical structure\nleaving one bereft of theorems through which to make progress). Other\nnotions of closeness on the collection may depend on a fuller notion of\ncomparison between instants, i.e. their joint consideration rather than a\nsubsequent comparison of real numbers extracted from each individually.\nThat may serve as a means of judging which instants are similar, or of which\ninstants can evolve into each other along dynamical trajectories. Some\n1P\n\ndenotes probability and | denotes 'given that', i.e. conditional probability.\n\n6\n\n\fcriteria to determine which notion to use [27] are adherence to the axioms\nof distance, gauge or 3-Diffeomorphism invariance as suitable, and, for some\napplications, whether it can be applied to grand heaps.\nOne way of providing comparers is to upgrade the previous subsection's normed spaces and geometries to inner product spaces, metric spaces\nand topological spaces [23, 1]. In the case of inner products or metrics,\nM\u0393\u2206 Q\u0393 Q\u2032\u2206 then supplies a primitive comparer of unprimed and primed\nobjects Q\u0393 , Q\u2032\u2206 .\nAlso consider replacing Q\u2206 by the tangent bundle T(Q\u2206 ) (configurationvelocity space [9]), or the unit\ntangent bundle Tu (Q\u2206 ) (configuration-direction space), or the cotangent\nbundle T\u2217 (Q\u2206 ) (configuration-momentum space, which, if augmented by a\nsymplectic structure, is phase space). Such notions continue to exist for\nrestricted configuration spaces in cases with constraints. This last feature\ninvolves quotienting operations, which can considerably complicate structure in practise. Envisage all these as 'heaps of decorated instants', H, which\nmore general notion I use to supercede Q.\nA common situation is to compare not configurations Q\u0393 and Q\u2032\u2206 but\nrather the corresponding velocities Q\u0307\u0393 and Q\u0307\u2032\u2206 , with the comparer employing the kinetic metric An example of such a comparer\np is the Lagrangian\nL : T(G-bundle over Q) \u2212\u2192 R L[Q\u2206 , g\u039b , Q\u0307\u2206 , \u0121\u039b ] = 2 T{U + E} , where,\nin this seminar's examples, U is minus the potential term V(Q\u2206 ) and T\n\u2212\u2192\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\nis the kinetic term T[Q\u2206 , g\u039b , Q\u0307\u2206 , \u0121\u039b ] = M \u0393\u2206 (Q\u0398 ){ G Q\u0307\u0393 } G Q\u0307\u2206 /2 for\n\u2212\u2192\nG the action of the group G of redundant motions whose generators are\nparametrized by auxiliary variables g\u039b . [Here, the dot denotes the derivative\nwith respect to label-time, an overall time that is meaningless because the\nactions considered are invariant under label change (= reparametrization)].\nThis also exemplifies that one often corrects the Q\u0393 or Q\u0307\u0393 with respect\nto a group G of transformations under which they are held to be physically\nunchanged. That involves the group action of G on the Q\u0393 or Q\u0307\u0393 . E.g. for\nparticle velocities q\u0307i\u03b1 , the infinitesimal action of the rotations (generated\n\u2192\n\nby b\u03b1 ) is q\u0307i\u03b1 \u2212\u2192 R q\u0307i\u03b1 = q\u0307i\u03b1 + qi\u03b1 \u00d7 \u1e03\u03b1 E.g. for 3-metric velocities\n\u1e23\u03bc\u03bd , the infinitesimal action of the 3-diffeomorphisms (generated by B\u03b1 ) is\n\u2192\n\n\u1e23\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\u2192 Diff \u1e23\u03bc\u03bd = \u1e23\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u00a3\u1e02 h\u03bc\u03bd . One furthermore often then minimizes\nwith respect to the group generator (arbitrary frame 'shuffling auxiliary').\nThis ensures the physical requirement of G-invariance (i.e. gauge invariance,\nincluding 3-diffeomorphism invariance in geometrodynamics).\nmin\n\n\u2192\n\nThen one has e.g. 1) The Kendall-type comparer [1] g \u2208 G M\u0393\u2206 Q\u0393 G Q\u2032\u2206\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\nfor G the finite group action. 2) Construct M\u0393\u2206 {G Q\u0307\u0393 } G Q\u0307\u2206 for G the\n\n7\n\n\finfinitesimal group action. Then weight by U + E, square-root, then integrate with respect to spatial extent if required and with respect to label\ntime so as to produce the corresponding action. Variation of this ensures\nG-independence. Actions of this form include [1] the Jacobi action for mechanics, Barbour\u2013Bertotti type actions for RPM, and the Baierlein\u2013Sharp\u2013\nWheeler type actions for geometrodynamics. The variational procedure\nthen entails minimization with respect to g\u039b . One could also weight by\n1/{U + E} and square-root. This gives Leibniz\u2013Mach\u2013Barbour timefunctions (c.f. [9, 26]). Another variant is the DeWitt measure of distance:\nlet one \u1e23\u03b1\u03b2 and 1 of the 2 metrics in each factor of the DeWitt supermetric be with respect to primed coordinates, integrate with respect to both\nprimed and unprimed space, and then square-root. One then obtains a semiRiemannian metric functional (in the sense of 'Finslerian metric function').\nIn inhomogenous geometrodynamics, one can likewise decompose combined\nmeasures of local size and shape into separate comparers (c.f. [27] and techniques in [28]). In each case, the individual rather than combined comparers\nare better-behaved as distances.\nComparers along the lines of 1) and 2) are universal, insofar as they apply both to RPM's and to GR. However, the GR version has an indefinite\ninner product which does not confer good distance properties in contrast\nto the positive definite one in mechanics. Thus one might need different\ntools in each case, or use only the shape part of the GR inner product,\nwhich is itself positive definite [27]. Instead of using highly redundant variables alongside gauge auxiliaries and a shuffling procedure, one could work\nwith reduced gauge-invariant configurations Q\u03a9 , for \u03a9 a smaller indexing\ne e\nset than \u2206, and\nq a Lagrangian L : T(Q\u03a9 ) \u2212\u2192 R constructed from these,\ne U\ne + E}\ne for T[Q\ne \u03a9 , Q\u0307\u03a9 ] a suitable, 'more twisted' kinetic\ne \u03a9 , Q\u0307\u03a9 ] = 2 T{\nL[Q\nterm. While, one seldom has this luxury of explicit gauge-invariant variables being available, it is available [23] for the 2d RPM of pure shape. The\nreduced configuration space metric is the Fubini\u2013Study metric, from which\nthis example's 'more twisted' kinetic term is formed. The associated notion of distance is then useable between 2d shapes. Alternatively, one could\nwork with (more widely available) secondary quantities that are guaranteed\nto have the suitable invariances, e.g. further spectral measures.\nIf there's a sense of more than one instant, there is one becoming question type per question type above, by the construction Prob(if Q\u2206 (p) has\nproperties P then it becomes Q\u2032\u2206 (p\u2032 ) with properties P \u2032 ). I denote each\nsuch question type as above but with 'Become' rather than 'Be'.\n\n8\n\n\f4.3\n\nIf there were a notion of time\n\nThen yet further question types would emerge. Each of the non-statespace\nquestions can now involve each instant being prescribed to be at a time.\nI denote this by appending a T. The new Be questions concern 'being at\na particular time', while the new Become questions are of the form 'X at\ntime 1 becomes Y at time 2'. For questions concerning heaps there is a\nfurther ambiguity: 'at any time' now makes sense as well as 'at a particular\ntime'. Thus for each BeS question there are two BeST questions (denoted\na, b), and for each BecomeS question there are four BecomeST questions\n(denoted a, b, c, d). Thus 32 question-types have been uncovered.\n\n4.4\n\nFurther analysis of question-types and of time\n\nFirst note Suppression 1: the 8 primed questions are clearly just subcases\nof their more realistic unprimed counterparts. Next note that the previous\nsubsection crucially does not say what time is. Ordinary classical physics\nis easily excused: there is a real number valued external time, so that each\nH is augmented to an extended heap space H \u00d7 R. One key lesson from\nGR, however, is that there is no such external time. Stationary spacetimes\n(including SR's Minkowski spacetime) do possess a timelike Killing vector,\npermitting a close analogue of external time to be used, but the generic\nGR solution permits no such construction. The generic solution of GR has\na vast family of coordinate timefunctions, none of which has a privileged\nstatus unlike that associated with a stationary spacetime's timelike Killing\nvector. Questions along the lines of those above which involve time need thus\nspecify which time. Using 'just any' time comes with the multiple choice\nand functional evolution [16] subaspects of the POT \u2013 this ambiguity tends\nto lead to inequivalent physics at the quantum level.\nAnother way of partly adhering to the above key lesson, which can be\nmodelled at the level of nonrelativistic but temporally-relational mechanical\nmodels, is that 'being, at a time t0 ' is by itself meaningless if one's theory\nis time label reparametrization invariant.\nAlternatives that render particular times, whether uniquely or in families\nup to frame embedding variables, meaningful are specific internal, emergent\nor apparent time approaches. Therein, time is but a property that can\nbe read off the (decorated sub)configuration. E.g. the notion of time in\n[13] can be thought of in this way. Thereby one has Subsumption 2: all\nquestion types involving a T are turned into the corresponding question\ntypes without one. This property might concern a clock within the environment/background, within the subsystem under study, or partly within\nboth. Indeed, one could have a universe-time to which all parts of the\n9\n\n\fconfiguration contribute rather than a clock subsystem.\nSubsumption 3: Each BecomeST b, c pair becomes a single question\ntype if there is time reversal invariance. Subsumption 4: If the time used\nis globally defined on H, BeSTb questions and BecomeSTd questions are\nredundant. This can in any case be attained by considering restricted H\ndefined so that this is so. (Whether that excludes interesting physics is\nthen pertinent). At this stage, one is left with 8 question types.\nSubsumption 5 has been suggested by Page (e.g [14]) and also to\nsome extent Barbour [3]. It consists in supplanting all becoming questions\nby more operationally accurate being questions as follows. It is not the past\ninstant that is involved, but rather this appearing as a memory/subrecord\nin the present instant, alongside the subsystem itself. Thus this is in fact\na correlation within the one instant. In this scheme, one does not have a\nsequence of events but rather one present event that contains memories or\nother evidence of 'other events'.2\nIf subsumption 5 is adopted, the remaining question types are Be2 about\nhow likely a correlation between two subsystems within the one grained\nsubinstant is, theory-observation question type BeS2 about how likely an\ninstant is within a statespace, and two 'consistency' question types Be1 and\nBeS1 about properties of a subinstant. If subsumption 5 is not adopted (or\nnot adoptable in practise), there are additionally four corresponding types\nof becoming questions. Reasons why subsumption 5 might not be adopted,\nor might not be a complete catch-all of what one would like to be explained\ninclude I) impracticality: studying a subsystem S now involves studying a\nlarger subsystem containing multiple imprints of S. Models involving memories would be particularly difficult to handle (see footnote 2). II) If one\nwants a scheme that can explain the Arrow of Time, then Page's scheme\nlooks to be unsatisfactory. While single instants such as that in footnote 2\ncould be used to simulate the scientific process as regards 'becoming questions', N.B. that these single instants correspond to the latest stage of the\ninvestigation (in the 'becoming' interpretation), while 'earlier instants' will\nnot have this complete information. III) Additionally, important aspects\nof the scientific enterprise look to be incomplete in this approach \u2013 in interpreting present correlations, one is in difficulty if one cannot affirm that\none did in fact prime the measuring apparatus would appear to retain its\nimportance. I.e. as well as the 'last instant' playing an important role in\nthe interpretation, initial conditions implicit in the 'first instant' also look\n2 As an illustrative sketch, one can imagine a configuration in which the record actually\nunder study is the na\u0131\u0308ve record plus the observer next to it, whose memory includes a\nSC which encodes himself peering at the record 'at an earlier time' and a SC in which he\nhas this first memory and a prediction 'derived from it'.\n\n10\n\n\fto play a role [1].\n\n4.5\n\nQM and beyond?\n\nAt the classical level, one could either take certainty to be a subcase of\nprobability, or note that even classically it is probabilities that are relevant\nin practise \u2013 e.g. due to limits on precision of observations. 2) A notion of\nP(trajectory goes through a subregion \u2206 for each space H) is then required.\nThis is particularly common in the literature in the case in which H is phase\nspace. Then if one canonically-quantizes, the Hamiltonian provides a TISE\nsuch as the WDE in the case of GR.\nBecause they refer to configurations, such as the almost flat, almost\nisotropic and almost homogeneous questions have obvious counterparts in\nconfiguration\u2013representation QM; in concerning pieces of the configuration space these questions lie outside the usual domain of QM. The Na\u0131\u0308ve\nSchr\u00f6dinger Interpretation and the Conditional Probabilities Interpretation\nare two interpretations outside or beyond conventional QM formalism suggested to answer such questions. The former serves to address the BeS1\nversion of this paragraph's questions, such as what is P(universe is almost\nflat) or what is P(Inflation) [1]. The latter addresses Be2 or BeS2 questions\nsuch as P(One part of the sky is smooth | another is) [all within a given\ninstantaneous configuration].\n\n5\n\nAre records typically useful?\n\nRecords Theory requires A) for SC's to be capable of holding enough information to address whatever issues are under investigation. Thus Information Theory is pertinent. Information being (more or less) negentropy,\na starting classical notion is the Boltzmann-like IBoltzmann = \u2212logW (using\nkB = 1 units) for W the number of microstates.POne could furthermore use\nsuch as Shannon information, IShannon (px ) = x px logpxR for px a discrete\nprobability distribution for the records, or IShannon [\u03c3] = d\u03a9\u03c3log\u03c3 for \u03c3 a\ncontinuous probability distribution. If one considers records at the quantum\nlevel, then one could instead use such as von Neumann information,\nIvon Neumann [\u03c1] = Tr(\u03c1log\u03c1) for \u03c1 the QM density matrix. These notions\nhave suitable properties and remain applicable [1] in passing to QFT and\nGR contexts. One contention in interpreting (0) at the general level required\nfor developing a POT strategy is that information is minus entropy and\nclassical (never mind quantum) gravitational entropy is a concept that is not\nwell understood or quantified for general spacetimes [1]. Quantum gravity\nmay well have an information notion I[\u03c1QGrav ] = Tr\u03c1QGrav log\u03c1QGrav , but\n11\n\n\feither the quantum-gravitational density matrix is an unknown object since\nthe underlying microstates are unknown, or, alternatively, one would need\nto provide an extra procedure for obtaining this, such as how to solve and\ninterpret the WDE, which would be fraught with numerous further technical\nand conceptual problems.\nRather than a notion of gravitational information that is completely\ngeneral, a notion of entropy suitable for approximate classical and quantum\ncosmologies may suffice for the present study. Quite a lot of candidate\nobjects of this kind have been proposed. However, it is unclear how some of\nthese would arise from the above fundamental picture, while for others it is\nnot clear that the candidate does in fact possess properties that make it a\nbona fide entropy [1]. Cosmologically relevant information notions proposed\nto date include some that are manifestly related to theR above conventional\nnotions of information, and also [22] use IHBM [\u03b5] = d\u03a9\u03b5log(\u03b5/h\u03b5i) and\n\u2032\nIHBM\n[\u03b5] = h\u03b5log(\u03b5/h\u03b5i)i, the first of which is a relative information type\nquantity (see Sec 6).\nB) However, whether there is a pattern in a record or collection of records\n(and whether that pattern is significant rather than random) involves more\nthan just how much information is contained within. Two placings of the\nsame pieces on a chessboard could be, respectively, from a grandmasters'\ngame and frivolous. What one requires is a general quantification of there\nbeing a pattern. This should be linked at least in part to information content, in that the realization of at least some complicated patterns requires\na minimum amount of information. Records Theory is, intuitively, about\ndrawing conclusions from similar patterns in different records.\nConsider also the situation in which information in a curve or in a wave\npulse that is detectable by/storeable in a detector in terms of approximands\nor modes. As regards localized useable information content per unit volume,\nconsidering the Joos\u2013Zeh dust\u2013CMB and \u03b1-track\u2013bubble chamber side by\nside suggests that most records in nature/one's model will be poor or diffuse. For the Joos\u2013Zeh [21] example the 'somewhere' is all over the place:\n\"in the vastness of cosmological space\". Detectors, such as the extension of\nHalliwell's 1-piece detector model (Sec 3.3, [18]) to a cluster, could happen\nto be tuned to pick up the harmonics that are principal contributors in the\nsignal. In this way one can obtain a good approximation to a curve from\nrelatively little information. E.g. compare the square wave with the almostsquare wave that is comprised of the first 10 harmonics of the square wave.\nThat is clearly specific information as opposed to information storage capacity in general. Likewise, a bubble chamber is attuned to seeing tracks, a\ndetector will often only detect certain (expected) frequencies. Through such\nspecialization, a record that 'stands out' can be formed. One should thus\n\n12\n\n\finvestigate is quantitatively which of the \u03b1-track and 'dust grain' paradigms\nis more common.\nC) Information can be lost from a record 'after its formative event' \u2013 the\nword \"stored\" in (0) can also be problematic. Photos yellow with age and\ncan be defaced or doctored.\n\n6\n\nCorrelations between records\n\nOne concept of possible use is mutual information: this is a notion M (A, B)\n= I(A) + I(B) \u2212 I(AB) for AB the joint distribution of A and B for each of\nclassical Shannon or QM von Neumann information.\nP This is a quantity of\nthe relative information\ntype\n[1],\nI\n[p,\nq]\n=\nrelative\nx px log(px /qx ) (discrete\nR\ncase), Irelative [\u03c3, \u03c4 ] = d\u03a9\u03c3log(\u03c3/\u03c4 ) (continuous case), (the object in Sec\n4.1 is a special case of the continuous case of this in which the role of the second distribution is played by the average of the first). The QM counterpart\nof relative information is Irelative [\u03c11 , \u03c12 ] = Tr(\u03c11 {log\u03c11 \u2212 log\u03c12 }) ; mutual\ninformation also has QM analogues. It is not clear that these notions cover\nall patterns. Two records could be part of a discernible common pattern\neven if their constituent information is entirely different, e.g. the pattern to\nspot on two chessboards could be interprotection, manifest between rooks\non one and between knights on the other.\nAnother is the family of notions of correlator/n-point function in the\ncosmological or QFT senses (or both at once).\n\n7\n\nFurther features of Records Theory\n\nBarbour furthermore asks [3] whether there are any selection principles for\nsuch records (which he calls 'time capsules'; the bubble chamber with the\n\u03b1-particle track within is a such). If these features are to be incorporated,\none would additionally need a (relative) measure of semblance of dynamics.\nHow does a record achieve this encodement? Are SC's that encode this\ngeneric? Let us suppose that this is actually a special rather than generic\nfeature for a SC to have. This would be the case if the dust grain\u2013CMB\nphoton paradigm is more typical than the \u03b1-particle\u2013bubble chamber one.\nThen one would have the problem of explaining why the universe around\nus nevertheless contains a noticeable portion of noticeably history-encoding\nrecords, i.e. a selection principle would be needed.\nBarbour suggests a selection principle based on the following layers [3].\n1) There are some distinctive places in the configuration space. 2) The\nwavefunction of the universe peaks around these places, making them prob-\n\n13\n\n\fable. 3) These parts of the configuration space contain records that bear a\nsemblance of dynamics ('time capsules'). [Following my arguments in Sec\n1, this should be rephrased in terms of SC's.] Some doubts are cast on\nthis scheme in [1]. In particular, A) Barbour supplies no concrete mathematical model evidence for there being any correlation between SC's being\ntime capsules and their being near a distinctive feature of SC space such\nas a change of stratum or a point of great uniformity. B) Semiclassicality\nmight either explain or supplant Barbour's selection principle, while there\nare additionally two further a priori unrelated selection principles in the\nliterature, which could be viewed either as competitors or as features that\nBarbour's scheme should be checked to be able to account for: I) branching\nprocesses and II) consistency conditions in the Histories Theory framework.\nOne reason that Barbour favours the above scheme is so as to be open\nto the possibility of explaining the Arrow of Time, unlike I), II), [8] (which\nbuilds in a time asymmetry in the choice of admitted solutions), and Page's\nscheme (which is subject to the difficulties pointed out in Sec 4.4). These\nvarious interesting issues should be further investigable using RPM's.\nAs regards Records Theory as a POT resolution, limitations exposed in\nthis seminar are as follows. Records are \"somewhere in the universe that\ninformation is stored when histories decohere\". But a suitable notion of\nlocalization in space and in configuration space may be hard to come by\nand/or to use for quantum gravity in general \u2013 'where' particular records\nare can be problematic to quantify, and the records can be problematic\nto access and use too, since the relevant information may be 'all over the\nplace'. Also, 'information' is problematic both as it may be of too poor a\nquality to reconstruct the history and because a suitably general notion of\ninformation is missing from our current understanding of classical gravity,\nnever mind quantum gravity with its unknown microstates (mechanical toy\nmodels are useful in not having this last obstruction). Finally, the further\nRecords Theory notions of significant correlation patterns and how one is to\ndeduce dynamics/history from them looks to be a difficult and unexplored\narea even in simpler contexts than gravitation.\nAcknowledgments I thank Peterhouse for funding and the organizers of\nTAM 2007 for inviting me.\n\nReferences\n[1] See E.
