Introduction\nIn this paper, we will consider finitely presented groups that have a finite index\nsubgroup which admits a surjective homomorphism onto a non-abelian free group. Gromov called these groups large [4]. Large groups have particularly nice properties (for\nexample, super-exponential subgroup growth). They also play an important r\u00f4le in lowdimensional topology: it is a major conjecture that the fundamental group of any closed\nhyperbolic 3-manifold is large. Our main theorem is a characterisation of these groups\nin terms of the existence of a normal series where successive quotients are finite abelian\ngroups with sufficiently large rank and order.\nTheorem 1.1. Let G be a finitely presented group. Then the following are equivalent:\n1. some finite index subgroup of G admits a surjective homomorphism onto a nonabelian free group;\n2. there exists a sequence G1 \u2265 G2 \u2265 . . . of finite index subgroups of G, each normal\nin G1 , such that\n(i) Gi /Gi+1 is abelian for all i \u2265 1;\n(ii) limi\u2192\u221e ((log[Gi : Gi+1 ])/[G : Gi ]) = \u221e;\n(iii) lim supi (d(Gi /Gi+1 )/[G : Gi ]) > 0.\nHere, d( ) denotes the rank of a group, which is its minimal number of generators.\nNote that condition (i) does not require G/G1 to be an abelian group. Indeed, it\ncannot, since there are finitely presented groups that are both perfect and large. In\nwords, condition (ii) requires the order of Gi /Gi+1 to grow super-exponentially as a\nfunction of [G : Gi ]. Condition (iii) asserts that the rank of the quotients Gi /Gi+1\ngrows linearly in the index [G : Gi ]. This is the fastest it could possibly grow, since the\nReidermeister-Schreier theorem implies that the rank of Gi grows at most linearly in\n[G : Gi ].\nThe main part of Theorem 1.1, the implication (2) \u21d2 (1), is in fact a corollary of\nthe following stronger, but slightly less elegant, result.\n\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.2. Let G be a finitely presented group, and suppose that, for each natural\nnumber i, there is a triple Hi \u2265 Ji \u2265 Ki of finite index normal subgroups of G such that\n(i) Hi /Ji is abelian for all i;\n(ii) limi\u2192\u221e ((log[Hi : Ji ])/[G : Hi ]) = \u221e;\n(iii) lim supi (d(Ji /Ki )/[G : Ji ]) > 0.\nThen Ki admits a surjective homomorphism onto a free non-abelian group, for infinitely\nmany i.\nThis gives (2) \u21d2 (1) of Theorem 1.1, via the following argument. We may replace\nG by G1 , and thereby assume that each Gi is normal in G. If we then set Hi = Gi , Ji =\nGi+1 and Ki = Gi+2 , Theorem 1.2 implies that infinitely many Gi admit a surjective\nhomomorphism onto a free non-abelian group.\nIn fact, the statements of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 are not the strongest that can be\nmade. The existence of infinitely many subgroups Gi (in Theorem 1.1) or infinitely\nmany triples Hi \u2265 Ji \u2265 Ki (in Theorem 1.2) is more than one needs to deduce that G\nis large. This conclusion still holds if one replaces hypotheses (ii) and (iii) of Theorem\n1.2 by an explicit inequality which relates [Hi : Ji ], [G : Hi ], d(Ji /Ki ), for some fixed i,\nand data from a fixed presentation of G. The precise statement of this result, which is\nrather unwieldy, appears as Theorem 4.2 in Section 4.\nWhat makes the results of this paper noteworthy is their method of proof. Despite\nthe fact that these theorems are purely group-theoretic, their proof uses very little\nalgebra. Instead, the geometry and topology of finite Cayley graphs play a central r\u00f4le.\nThis is the second in a pair of papers that exploit these type of arguments. The first [5]\nrelated Property (\u03c4 ), the rank of finite index subgroups and their possible decomposition\nas a graph of groups. Using this relationship, the proof of a weaker form of Theorem\n1.1 was sketched.\nLarge groups were studied by Baumslag and Pride [1] who showed that groups with\na presentation having (at least) two more generators than relations are of this form.\nThis is an easy consequence of Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 1.3. Let G be a group having a presentation with at least two more generators than relations. Then G has a finite index subgroup that admits a surjective\nhomomorphism onto a free non-abelian group.\nBaumslag and Pride also conjectured [2] that when a group G has a presentation\n\n2\n\n\fwith one more generator than relation, but one of the relations is a proper power, then\nG is large. This was proved independently by Gromov [4] using bounded cohomology\nand by St\u00f6hr [10] using a direct algebraic argument. Again, this is a straightforward\nconsequence of Theorem 1.1.\nCorollary 1.4. Let G be a group having a presentation with one more generator than\nrelation. Suppose that one of these relations is proper power. Then G has a finite index\nsubgroup that admits a surjective homomorphism onto a free non-abelian group.\nWe will prove these corollaries in \u00a75.\nWe will also show that conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 1.1 are, in fact, equivalent\nto the existence of a finite index subgroup with infinite abelianisation.\nTheorem 1.5. Let G be a finitely presented group. Then the following are equivalent:\n1. some finite index subgroup of G has infinite abelianisation;\n2. there exists a sequence G1 \u2265 G2 \u2265 . . . of finite index subgroups of G, each normal\nin G1 , such that\n(i) Gi /Gi+1 is abelian for all i \u2265 1;\n(ii) limi\u2192\u221e ((log[Gi : Gi+1 ])/[G : Gi ]) = \u221e.\nThe proof of this result, which is topological and rather straightforward, is given in\n\u00a76.\nI am grateful to Peter Shalen for a discussion at the early stages of this project,\nwhen he suggested that a result along the lines of Theorem 1.1 might be true. I am also\ngrateful to Alex Lubotzky for some useful conversations about Property (\u03c4 ), when we\ndiscussed conditions similar to those in Theorem 1.1.\n2. The forwards implication\nIn this section, we will prove (1) \u21d2 (2) of Theorem 1.1. Let G1 be the finite index\nsubgroup of G that admits a surjective homomorphism onto a non-abelian free group F .\nDefine recursively the following finite index normal subgroups of F . Set L1 = F , and,\nfor i \u2265 1, let Li+1 = [Li , Li ](Li )i . In other words, Li+1 is the group generated by the\ncommutators and the ith powers of Li . Thus, {Li } is a nested sequence of subgroups\nof F . Each is characteristic in the preceding one, and hence each is characteristic in F ,\nand is therefore normal in F . Each Li is free with rank d(Li ) = (d(F ) \u2212 1)[F : Li ] + 1,\n\n3\n\n\fand Li /Li+1 is isomorphic to (Z/iZ)d(Li ) .\nSet Gi to be the inverse image of Li in G, which is a normal subgroup of G1 . Then\nG1 /Gi is isomorphic to F/Li , and Gi /Gi+1 is isomorphic to Li /Li+1 , which is abelian,\nverifying (i) of Theorem 1.1. To check (iii), note that\nd(Gi /Gi+1 ) = d(Li /Li+1 ) = d(Li ) = (d(F ) \u2212 1)[F : Li ] + 1 = (d(F ) \u2212 1)[G1 : Gi ] + 1.\nSimilarly, to establish (ii), we note that\nlog[Gi : Gi+1 ] = log(id(Li ) ) = d(Li ) log i > [G1 : Gi ] log i.\n\n3. The width and Cheeger constant of finite graphs\nMany of the ideas behind this paper arise from the theory of Property (\u03c4 ). This is\na particularly useful group-theoretic concept, introduced by Lubotzky and Zimmer [8],\nthat can be defined using graph theory, representation theory or differential geometry.\nWe concentrate on the former approach. The Cheeger constant of a finite graph X,\ndenoted h(X), is defined to be\n\u001b\n\u001a\n|V (X)|\n|\u2202A|\n: A \u2282 V (X) and 0 < |A| \u2264\n.\nmin\n|A|\n2\nHere, V (X) denotes the vertex set of X, and, for a subset A of V (X), \u2202A denotes the\nset of edges with one endpoint in A and one not in A. Informally, having small Cheeger\nconstant is equivalent to the existence of a 'bottleneck' in the graph. (See Figure 1.)\n\nA\n\n\u2202A\n\nV(X) - A\n\nFigure 1.\nLet G be a group with a finite generating set S. Let {Gi } be a collection of finite\nindex normal subgroups. We denote the Cayley graph of G/Gi with respect to S by\nX(G/Gi ; S). The group G is said to have Property (\u03c4 ) with respect to {Gi } if the\n4\n\n\fCheeger constants h(X(G/Gi; S)) are bounded away from zero. This property turns\nout not to depend on the choice of finite generating set S.\nWhether or not a given group and a collection of finite index subgroups have Property (\u03c4 ) is a subtle and often difficult question. The following theorem of Lubotzky and\nWeiss [7] gives a necessary condition for a group to have Property (\u03c4 ). This is not, in\nfact, how Lubotzky and Weiss stated their result (which appears as Theorem 3.6 of [7]),\nbut this formulation can readily be deduced from their argument.\nTheorem 3.1. Suppose that a finitely generated group G has Property (\u03c4 ) with respect\nto a collection C of finite index normal subgroups. Then there is a constant c with the\nfollowing property. If J is a member of C, and J is contained in a normal subgroup H\nof G such that H/J is abelian, then |H/J | < c[G:H] .\nThus, conditions (i) and (ii) of Theorem 1.2 imply that G does not have Property\n(\u03c4 ) with respect to {Ji }. We will actually need to establish a stronger version of Theorem\n3.1. Instead of relating to the Cheeger constant of X(G/Ji ; S) (for some finite generating\nset S), we need to consider a related geometric invariant of X(G/Ji; S), its width, which\nis defined as follows.\nLet X be a finite graph. Consider a linear ordering on its vertices. For 0 \u2264 n \u2264\n|V (X)|, let Dn be the first n vertices. The width of the ordering is defined to be\nmaxn |\u2202Dn |. The width of the graph is the minimal width of any of its orderings, and\nis denoted w(X).\nThis notion is inspired by a useful concept from the theory of knots and 3-manifolds,\nknown as thin position [9], which was first introduced by Gabai [3]. We now develop\nthis analogy (which is not essential for an understanding of the remainder of the paper).\nOne may imagine the graph X embedded in R3 , with its vertices all at distinct heights,\nand with its edges realised as straight lines. The height of the vertices specifies a\nlinear ordering on them. The width of this ordering can be interpreted geometrically, as\nfollows. Imagine a 1-parameter family of horizontal planes, parametrised by their heights\nwhich increase monotonically from \u2212\u221e to \u221e. The width of the ordering is equal to\nthe maximal number of intersections between the graph and any of these planes. (See\nFigure 2 for an example.) Thus, to determine the width of X, one should aim to find\nthe most efficient embedding in R3 : the one that minimises the width of the associated\nordering. This is highly analogous to thin position for knots in R3 , where one aims to\nisotope the knot until a similar notion of width is minimised.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n4\nordering\non vertices\n\n4\n3\nplanes\n(seen side on)\n\nX\nnumber of\nintersections\n\nFigure 2.\nThere is a relationship between the width of a graph and its Cheeger constant. In an\nordering on V (X) of minimal width, consider Dn where n = \u230a|V (X)|/2\u230b. By computing\n|\u2202Dn |/|Dn |, we deduce that\nh(X) \u2264\n\nw(X)\n.\n\u230a|V (X)|/2\u230b\n\nHence, the following gives a stronger version of Theorem 3.1. It gives a condition\nguaranteeing that certain Cayley graphs have width which is asymptotically smaller\nthan their number of vertices.\nTheorem 3.2. Let G be a group with a finite generating set S. Suppose that, for each\nnatural number i, there is a pair Hi \u2265 Ji of finite index normal subgroups of G, such\nthat\n(i) Hi /Ji is abelian for all i;\n(ii) limi\u2192\u221e ((log[Hi : Ji ])/[G : Hi ]) = \u221e.\nThen w(X(G/Ji ; S))/[G : Ji ] \u2192 0.\nNote that (i) and (ii) are precisely those in Theorem 1.2.\nThe proof we give of this result follows the argument of Lubotzky and Weiss in\ntheir proof of Theorem 3.1. The following lemma allows us to estimate the width of\nX(G/Ji ; S) in terms of the width of a Cayley graph of Hi /Ji . This will be useful, since\nHi /Ji is abelian, and, later, we will analyse the width of Cayley graphs of finite abelian\ngroups.\n\n6\n\n\fLemma 3.3. Let G be a group with a finite generating set S, and let Hi \u2265 Ji be finite\nindex normal subgroups of G. Let \u03a3 be a generating set for Hi arising from S by the\nReidermeister-Schreier process. Then\nw(X(G/Ji ; S)) \u2264 w(X(Hi /Ji ; \u03a3)) + 2|S|[G : Hi ].\n\nProof. We first recall the Reidermeister-Schreier process. Pick a presentation for G with\ngenerating set S, but possibly an infinite number of relations. (We are not assuming\nhere that G is finitely presented.) Build the associated 2-complex C, by starting with\na bouquet of |S| circles and attaching on a 2-cell for each relation. Then \u03c01 (C) is\nisomorphic to G. Let C \u2032 \u2192 C be the covering corresponding to the subgroup Hi ,\nso that \u03c01 (C \u2032 ) is isomorphic to Hi . Pick a maximal tree T in the 1-skeleton of C \u2032 .\n\u2032\n\nCollapsing this tree to a point gives a new 2-complex C . Its 1-cells give the required\ngenerating set \u03a3 for Hi .\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nLet C \u2032\u2032 \u2192 C \u2032 and C \u2192 C be the coverings corresponding to Ji . The inverse image\nof T in C \u2032\u2032 is a forest F . If one were to collapse each component of this forest to a single\n\u2032\u2032\n\n\u2032\u2032\n\nvertex, we would obtain C . The 1-skeletons of C \u2032\u2032 and C are, respectively, X(G/Ji ; S)\nand X(Hi /Ji ; \u03a3).

From this, one can construct an\n\u2032\u2032\n\nordering of V (C \u2032\u2032 ), as follows. The ordering on V (C ) specifies an ordering on the\ncomponents of F . We therefore order V (C \u2032\u2032 ) by ordering the vertices of its first tree in\nsome way, then the vertices of its second tree, and so on.\nFor any integer n, with 0 \u2264 n \u2264 |V (C \u2032\u2032 )|, let Dn be the first n vertices of C \u2032\u2032 .\nSuppose that the nth vertex of C \u2032\u2032 lies in a component T\u0303 of F . Then, the edges in \u2202Dn\nconsist of edges joining trees other than T\u0303 , and edges with at least one endpoint in T\u0303 .\nThere are at most w(X(Hi /Ji ; \u03a3)) edges of the first type and at most 2|S|[G : Hi ] edges\nof the second type. Thus the width of C \u2032\u2032 is at most the sum of these quantities.\nAs a result of the above lemma, we concentrate on the Cayley graph of the abelian\ngroup Hi /Ji . The following lemma provides a useful upper bound on its width.\nLemma 3.4. Let A be a finite abelian group with finite generating set \u03a3. Then\n\nw(X(A; \u03a3)) \u2264\n\n6|\u03a3||A|\n.\n\u230a(|A| \u2212 1)1/|\u03a3| \u230b\n\nProof. We will construct an efficient ordering of the vertices of X(A; \u03a3) by placing\nthem on the unit circle in a suitable way. Give the circle a group structure, by identifying it with C\u00d7 , the multiplicative group of complex numbers with modulus one.\nAny homomorphism \u03c6: A \u2192 C\u00d7 determines a point in (C\u00d7 )|\u03a3| , given by the |\u03a3|-tuple\n(\u03c6(s) : s \u2208 \u03a3). Define c to be \u230a(|A| \u2212 1)1/|\u03a3| \u230b, which is the denominator in the upper\nbound on w(X(A; \u03a3)) that we are trying to establish. We may assume that c is a positive integer; otherwise, there is nothing to prove. Divide the circle C\u00d7 into c equal arcs.\nThis determines a decomposition of (C\u00d7 )|\u03a3| into c|\u03a3| < |A| boxes. There are precisely\n|A| distinct homomorphisms A \u2192 C\u00d7 , and hence two distinct homomorphisms are sent\nto the same box. Their quotient is a non-trivial homomorphism \u03c6: A \u2192 C\u00d7 , such that\n|arg(\u03c6(s))| \u2264 2\u03c0/c for all s \u2208 \u03a3. Here, we are taking arguments to lie in the range\n(\u2212\u03c0, \u03c0].\nLet \u03c3 be the element of A/Ker(\u03c6), such that \u03c6(\u03c3) has smallest positive argument.\nThen \u03c3 is a generator for A/Ker(\u03c6). Let N be its order. Note that, for any s \u2208 \u03a3 that\ndoes not lie in Ker(\u03c6), N \u2265 2\u03c0/|arg(\u03c6(s))| \u2265 c. Since this is true for at least one s \u2208 \u03a3,\nwe deduce that N \u2265 c.\nWe place an order on the vertices of A, as follows. First order the vertices in Ker(\u03c6)\nin some way, then order the coset \u03c6\u22121 (\u03c3), then \u03c6\u22121 (\u03c3 2 ), and so on. (See Figure 4.)\n8\n\n\fInduced ordering\non vertices\n\nVertices of X(A;\n\nEdges of X(A;\n\nS)\n\nS)\n\nplaced on circle\n\nFigure 4.\nNote that any edge in X(A; \u03a3) joins vertices who images in A/Ker(\u03c6) differ by\ni\n\n\u03c3 , where |i| is at most N/c. Let Dn be a subset of the vertices of X(A; \u03a3), as in the\ndefinition of width. If we consider the initial vertex of an edge in \u2202Dn , its image in\nA/Ker(\u03c6) can take at most 4(N/c) + 2 possible values. This is at most 6(N/c), since\nN/c \u2265 1. Hence, there are at most 6(N/c)|Ker(\u03c6)| = 6|A|/c such vertices. Since |\u03a3|\noriented edges emanate from any vertex, there are therefore at most 6|\u03a3||A|/c edges in\n\u2202Dn . This gives the required upper bound on the width of X(A; \u03a3).\nProof of Theorem 3.2. By Lemma 3.3,\nw(X(G/Ji ; S))\nw(X(Hi /Ji ; \u03a3)) 2|S|[G : Hi ]\n\u2264\n+\n.\n[G : Ji ]\n[G : Ji ]\n[G : Ji ]\nBy assumption (ii), [Hi : Ji ] grows super-exponentially as a function of [G : Hi ]. In\nparticular, [Hi : Ji ] tends to infinity, and so the second term tends to zero. For the first\nterm, assumption (i) and Lemma 3.4 imply that\n6|\u03a3|\nw(X(Hi /Ji ; \u03a3))\n\u2264\n.\n[G : Ji ]\n[G : Hi ]\u230a([Hi : Ji ] \u2212 1)1/|\u03a3| \u230b\nFrom the Reidermeister-Schreier process, |\u03a3| grows linearly in [G : Hi ]. So, |\u03a3|/[G : Hi ]\nis bounded above and, by assumption (ii), ([Hi : Ji ] \u2212 1)1/|\u03a3| tends to infinity.\n4. Proof of the main theorem\nTheorem 1.2 follows immediately from Theorem 3.2 and the following result.\nTheorem 4.1. Let G be a finitely presented group with a finite generating set S.\nSuppose that, for each natural number i, there is a pair Ji \u2265 Ki of finite index normal\nsubgroups of G, such that\n9\n\n\f(I) w(X(G/Ji ; S))/[G : Ji ] \u2192 0;\n(II) lim supi (d(Ji /Ki )/[G : Ji ]) > 0.\nThen, for infinitely many i, Ki admits a surjective homomorphism onto a free nonabelian group.\nNote that in the above theorem, we no longer need the hypothesis that any quotient\ngroups are abelian.\nThe proof we give of Theorem 4.1 resembles some of the arguments in [5]. Suppose\nthat (I) and (II) of the theorem hold. Let C be a finite 2-complex having fundamental\ngroup G, arising from a finite presentation of G with generating set S. Thus, C has\na single vertex, and an oriented edge for each element of S. Let L be the sum of the\nlengths of the relations in this presentation, which we may assume is at least one.\nLet Ci \u2192 C be the covering corresponding to Ji , and let Xi = X(G/Ji ; S) be the\n1-skeleton of Ci . Set l to be\nlim sup\ni\n\nd(Ji /Ki )\n,\n[G : Ji ]\n\nwhich by (II) is positive. For infinitely many i,\nd(Ji /Ki )\n3l\n> .\n[G : Ji ]\n4\n\n(1)\n\nBy (I), w(Xi )/[G : Ji ] \u2192 0. Hence, provided i is sufficiently large,\nl\nw(Xi )\n<\n.\n[G : Ji ]\n8L\n\n(2)\n\nAlso, for all large i,\n\n8(2|S| + L2 )\n.\nl\nWe now fix some i so that the inequalities (1), (2) and (3) hold.\n[G : Ji ] \u2265\n\n(3)\n\nWe will show that there is a surjective homomorphism from Ki onto a free nonabelian group. The details of this argument are a little complicated, but the main idea\nis fairly simple. We use a minimal width ordering on the vertices of Xi to divide Ci into\ntwo pieces A and B that are, roughly, equally 'big'. More precisely, the images of their\nfundamental groups in Ji /Ki both have large rank. (In fact, A and B might not be\nconnected, and so it might not make sense to refer to their fundamental group, but we\nwill ignore this point for the moment.) Since the width of Xi is small, the fundamental\ngroup of A \u2229 B has small rank, as therefore does its image in Ji /Ki . So, when the\ndecomposition of Ci into A and B is lifted to the covering space corresponding to Ki ,\n10\n\n\fthe lifted decomposition is modelled on a graph with negative Euler characteristic. The\ndesired conclusion, that Ki surjects onto a non-abelian free group, follows immediately.\nWe now give this argument in detail. Pick a minimal width ordering on the vertices\nof Xi . We will use this to define a height function f : Ci \u2192 R. On the vertices, simply\nlet f agree with the ordering function. Extend linearly over the 1-cells of Ci . Then we\nextend f continuously over the interior of each 2-cell, so that it is a Morse function there,\nwith the following properties. (There is one exceptional case: when all the vertices in\nthe boundary of a 2-cell are in fact the same 0-cell in Ci and hence have the same height,\nthen we define f to be constant on that 2-cell.) We can ensure that f has no maxima\nor minima in the interior of any 2-cell, and that its critical values avoid n + 12 , for each\ninteger n. We can also ensure that, whenever a 2-cell does not contains the vertex of\nheight n in its boundary, then that 2-cell contains no critical points with values between\nn\u2212\n\n1\n2\n\nand n + 21 .\n\nLet n be some integer between 0 and |V (Xi )|. We will focus on a single value of n\nlater. We can now use n and f to decompose Ci into two subsets An = f \u22121 (\u2212\u221e, n + 12 ]\nand Bn = f \u22121 [n + 21 , \u221e). Let Dn be the vertices of Ci that lie in An ; these are precisely\nthe first n vertices of the ordering.\nNote that An \u2229 Bn is a 1-complex, with precisely one 0-cell in the interior of each\nedge of \u2202Dn , and no other 0-cells. Hence, there are exactly |\u2202Dn | 0-cells of An \u2229 Bn .\nThis therefore is an upper bound on the number of components of An \u2229 Bn , and hence\non the number of components of An and on the number of components of Bn (provided\nn 6= 0, |V (Xi )|). Note that |\u2202Dn | \u2264 w(Xi ) < 81 l[G : Ji ], by inequality (2).\nThe 1-cells of An \u2229 Bn are arcs properly embedded in the 2-cells of Ci . We claim\nthat An \u2229 Bn has at most |\u2202Dn |L/2 1-cells. Note that the total number of times the\n2-cells of Ci run over any 1-cell of Ci is at most L. This is an upper bound for the\nvalence of each 0-cell of An \u2229 Bn . There are precisely |\u2202Dn | 0-cells of An \u2229 Bn , and\nhence we obtain the required bound on the number of 1-cells of An \u2229 Bn . Note that this\nbound |\u2202Dn |L/2 is at most w(Xi )L/2, which is less than 81 l[G : Ji ], by inequality (2).\nWe construct a graph Yn , as follows. Each vertex corresponds to a component of An\nor Bn , and is labelled An or Bn as appropriate. Each edge corresponds to a component\nof An \u2229 Bn . Incidence in the graph is defined by topological incidence. Since An \u2229 Bn\nhas a small regular neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to (An \u2229 Bn ) \u00d7 I, we may\ndefine a collapsing map Ci \u2192 Yn that sends each component of Ci \u2212 ((An \u2229 Bn ) \u00d7 I) to\nthe corresponding vertex of Yn , and that sends each component of (An \u2229 Bn ) \u00d7 I to the\nrelevant edge of Yn , via projection onto the second factor of the product. However, Yn\n11\n\n\fneed not be very interesting: it may only be a single edge, for example. But a similar\nconstruction in the covering space of Ci corresponding to the subgroup Ki will induce\nthe required surjective homomorphism from Ki onto a free non-abelian group.\n\nBn\nCi\n\nAn\n\nYn\n\nAn\n\nBn\n\nAn\n\nAn\nFigure 5.\nDefine the weight wt( ) of a vertex or edge, corresponding to a component E of An ,\nBn or An \u2229 Bn , to be d(i\u2217 \u03c01 E/i\u2217 \u03c01 E \u2229 Ki ), where i\u2217 : \u03c01 E \u2192 \u03c01 Ci is the homomorphism\ninduced by inclusion. (Note that the choice of basepoints for \u03c01 E does not affect this\nquantity.) Define the weight wt( ) of An , Bn or An \u2229 Bn to be the sum of the weights\nof its components. Note that wt(An \u2229 Bn ) is at most the number of 1-cells of An \u2229 Bn ,\nwhich we have already established is less than 18 l[G : Ji ].\nClaim. There is some n such that wt(An ) and wt(Bn ) are each at least 14 l[G : Ji ].\nDefine\nQ = {n : wt(An ) < 41 l[G : Ji ]}\nR = {n : wt(Bn ) < 41 l[G : Ji ]}.\nThe aim is to show that Q and R do not cover the interval from 0 to |V (Xi )|. Since\nJi is generated by the elements of i\u2217 \u03c01 E, where E runs over the components of An and\nBn , together with at most one generator for each component of An \u2229 Bn , we have the\ninequality\nd(Ji /Ki ) \u2264 wt(An ) + wt(Bn ) + |An \u2229 Bn |,\nand so, by the above bound on |An \u2229 Bn | and inequality (1),\nwt(An ) + wt(Bn ) \u2265 d(Ji /Ki ) \u2212 18 l[G : Ji ] > 85 l[G : Ji ].\n12\n\n\fHence, when n \u2208 Q, wt(Bn ) > 83 l[G : Ji ] and, when n \u2208 R, wt(An ) > 83 l[G : Ji ]. Thus,\nQ and R are disjoint. Note that 0 \u2208 Q and |V (Xi )| \u2208 R. Hence, the only way Q and R\ncould cover the interval from 0 to |V (Xi )| is if n \u2208 Q and n + 1 \u2208 R for some n. This\nimplies that\nwt(An ) < 41 l[G : Ji ]\n\nwt(An+1 ) > 83 l[G : Ji ].\n\nHowever, we shall now show that wt(An ) and wt(An+1 ) differ by at most 2|S| + L2 .\nSince 2|S| + L2 \u2264 18 l[G : Ji ], by inequality (3), this will provide a contradiction. It is\nclear that An+1 contains An . Only one vertex of Ci lies in An+1 but not An ; this is\nthe (n + 1)st vertex of the ordering, called x, say. In the 1-cells and 2-cells of Ci that\nare disjoint from x, An and An+1 differ only by a small collar. Hence, we need only\nfocus on the 1-cells and 2-cells that are adjacent to x. There are at most 2|S| of these\n1-cells, and at most L 2-cells. In each 2-cell adjacent to x, we can obtain An+1 from An\nby adding on a collection of discs that intersect An and the boundary of the 2-cell in a\ntotal of at most L arcs. Hence, it is clear that the weights of An+1 and An differ by at\nmost 2|S| + L2 . This proves the claim.\nWe now fix n as in the claim, and abbreviate An , Bn , An \u2229 Bn and Yn to A, B,\nA \u2229 B and Y . For any vertex u of Y , let g(u) denote its weight minus the total weight of\nthe edges to which it is incident. Then the sum of g(u), over all vertices u of Y labelled\nA, is wt(A) \u2212 wt(A \u2229 B), which is more than\n\n1\nl[G\n8\n\n: Ji ], and this is more than the\n\nnumber of vertices labelled A. Hence, there is some vertex u labelled A, with g(u) > 1.\nSimilarly, there is some vertex v labelled B with g(v) > 1. Let P be an embedded path\nin Y from u to v.\nLet p: C\u0303i \u2192 Ci be the covering corresponding to the subgroup Ki . The decomposition of Ci into A and B pulls back to form a similar decomposition of C\u0303i . We obtain a\nsimilar graph \u1ef8 . The covering map p: C\u0303i \u2192 Ci induces a map of graphs \u1ef8 \u2192 Y . (See\nFigure 6.) Let P\u0303 be the inverse image of P in \u1ef8 .\nThe valence of each vertex of P\u0303 is at least that of its image in P . When this image\nis not an endpoint of P , the valence is therefore at least two. We shall show that each\ninverse image of u and v has at least three edges of P\u0303 emanating from it. Let e be the\nedge of P incident to u. Let U and E be the components of A and A \u2229 B corresponding\nto u and e.\n\n13\n\n\fC~ i\n\ncollapse\n\nY~\n\np\nB\ncollapse\n\nCi\n\nY\n\nA\nFigure 6.\nClaim. For any vertex in P\u0303 that maps to u, the number of edges of P\u0303 to which it is\nincident is\n\n[i\u2217 \u03c01 U : i\u2217 \u03c01 U \u2229 Ki ]\n.\n[i\u2217 \u03c01 E : i\u2217 \u03c01 E \u2229 Ki ]\n\nSince p: C\u0303i \u2192 Ci is a regular cover, it has a group of covering transformations. This\ndescends to a group action on \u1ef8 which acts transitively on the vertices that map to u\nand acts transitively on the edges that map to e. Hence, we need only show that, in\n\u1ef8 , the number of e-labelled edges and the number of u-labelled vertices are in the ratio\ngiven by the above formula. In fact, we will show that the number of these edges and\nvertices are, respectively,\n[Ji : Ki ]\n,\n[i\u2217 \u03c01 E : i\u2217 \u03c01 E \u2229 Ki ]\n\n[Ji : Ki ]\n,\n[i\u2217 \u03c01 U : i\u2217 \u03c01 U \u2229 Ki ]\n\nwhich will prove the claim. Consider one such edge. It corresponds to a component\nZ of p\u22121 (E). Now, p|Z : Z \u2192 E is a covering map. It corresponds to the subgroup of\n\u03c01 (E) consisting of based loops in E that lift to loops in C\u0303i . This subgroup is i\u22121\n\u2217 Ki ,\nand hence the degree of p|Z is [\u03c01 E : i\u22121\n\u2217 Ki ] = [i\u2217 \u03c01 E : i\u2217 \u03c01 E \u2229 Ki ]. But the degree of\np is [Ji : Ki ], and so the number of covering translates of Z in C\u0303i , which is the number\nof e-labelled edges, is given by the required formula. The same argument applies to the\nu-labelled vertices, proving the claim.\n14\n\n\fNow,\nd(i\u2217 \u03c01 U/i\u2217 \u03c01 U \u2229 Ki ) \u2212 d(i\u2217 \u03c01 E/i\u2217 \u03c01 E \u2229 Ki ) = wt(u) \u2212 wt(e) \u2265 g(u) > 1.\nHence i\u2217 \u03c01 E/i\u2217 \u03c01 E \u2229 Ki has index more than two in i\u2217 \u03c01 U/i\u2217 \u03c01 U \u2229 Ki . Thus, the\nvalence of any u-labelled vertex in P\u0303 is more than two. The same argument applies\nto v. Hence, every edge of P\u0303 has valence at least two, and at least two vertices have\nvalence at least three. Therefore, \u03c7(P\u0303 ) < 0, and so \u03c7(\u1ef8 ) < 0. Thus, \u03c01 (\u1ef8 ) is a free\nnon-abelian group. But the collapsing map C\u0303i \u2192 \u1ef8 induces a surjective homomorphism\nKi \u2192 \u03c01 (\u1ef8 ). This proves Theorem 4.1 and hence Theorem 1.2.\nTheorem 1.2 can be strengthened to give the following, rather technical result.\nUnlike Theorem 1.2, this makes a hypothesis about just one triple H \u2265 J \u2265 K of finite\nindex normal subgroups of G.\nTheorem 4.2. Let G be a group with finite presentation hS|Ri. Let L be the sum of\nthe lengths of the relations R, which we assume is at least one. Suppose that G has\nfinite index normal subgroups H \u2265 J \u2265 K such that H/J is abelian and\nd(J/K) > max\n\n\u001a\n\n\u001b\n16L|S|\n48L|S|\n2\n, 16|S| + 8L .\n+\n\u230a([H : J ] \u2212 1)[G:H]\u22121|S|\u22121 \u230b [H : J ]\n\nThen K admits a surjective homomorphism onto a non-abelian free group.\nProof. All that one needed to make the proof of Theorem 4.1 work was the existence\nof a positive real number l such that inequalities (1), (2) and (3) all hold. If we set l\nto be d(J/K)/[G : J ], then (1) automatically is satisfied, and so we have reduced this\nto two inequalities. Inequality (3) becomes d(J/K) \u2265 16|S| + 8L2 , which is part of our\nhypothesis. To guarantee that inequality (2) holds, we use the inequalities in the proof\nof Theorem 3.2 (where \u03a3 is as defined in Lemma 3.3):\nw(X(G/J ; S))\nw(X(H/J ; \u03a3)) 2|S|[G : H]\n\u2264\n+\n[G : J ]\n[G : J ]\n[G : J ]\n6|\u03a3|\n2|S|\n\u2264\n+\n\u22121\n|\u03a3|\n[G : H]\u230a([H : J ] \u2212 1)\n\u230b [H : J ]\n2|S|\n6|S|[G : H]\n+\n\u2264\n\u22121 |S|\u22121\n[G:H]\n[G : H]\u230a([H : J ] \u2212 1)\n\u230b [H : J ]\nd(J/K)\n,\n<\n8L\nby our hypothesis. Hence, the proof of Theorem 4.1 gives a surjective homomorphism\nfrom K onto a free non-abelian group.\n15\n\n\f5. Groups with more generators than relations\nIn this section, we prove Corollaries 1.3 and 1.4.\nProof of Corollary 1.3. Let hX|Ri be a presentation for G with |X| \u2212 |R| > 1. We define\na nested sequence of finite index normal subgroups G = G1 \u2265 G2 \u2265 . . . recursively,\nby setting Gi+1 = [Gi , Gi ](Gi )i . Note that each is a characteristic subgroup of its\npredecessor, and so they are all normal in G.\nThe Reidermeister-Schreier process provides a presentation for Gi with a total of\n(|X|\u22121)[G : Gi ]+1 generators and |R|[G : Gi ] relations. Hence, the abelianisation of Gi\ncontains Zci as a summand, where ci = (|X| \u2212 1 \u2212 |R|)[G : Gi ] + 1. Therefore, Gi /Gi+1\nis an abelian group with (Z/iZ)ci as a summand. So, (i) of Theorem 1.1 holds. We now\nverify (ii) and (iii):\nd(Gi /Gi+1 ) \u2265 ci = (|X| \u2212 1 \u2212 |R|)[G : Gi ] + 1,\nwhich gives (iii), and\nlog[Gi : Gi+1 ] \u2265 log (ici ) = ((|X| \u2212 1 \u2212 |R|)[G : Gi ] + 1) log i,\nwhich implies (ii). So, Theorem 1.1 now gives the corollary.\nProof of Corollary 1.4. This is similar to the above proof. Again, let hX|Ri be the\nfinite presentation of G, with |X| \u2212 |R| = 1. Let wq be the relation in R that is a\nproper power. We may assume that q is prime. Define a nested sequence of finite index\nnormal subgroups G = G1 \u2265 G2 \u2265 . . . recursively, by setting Gi+1 = [Gi , Gi ](Gi )pi ,\nwhere pi is the ith prime bigger than q. Again, the Reidermeister-Schreier process gives\na presentation for Gi with (|X| \u2212 1)[G : Gi ] + 1 generators and |R|[G : Gi ] relations.\nThis has one more generator that relation. A presentation for Gi /[Gi , Gi ] is obtained by\ntaking the (|X| \u2212 1)[G : Gi ] + 1 generators, then abelianising, and then quotienting by\nthe |R|[G : Gi ] relations. Let Hi be the abelian group obtained by the above procedure,\nbut without quotienting by the relations that are lifts of wq . This has Z[G:Gi ]+1 as a\nsummand.\nWe claim that w \u2208 Gi for each i. We will show this by induction. It clearly holds for\ni = 1. Suppose therefore that w \u2208 Gi . Now, the image of w in Hi lies in the subgroup of\nHi generated by wq and wpi , since q is coprime to pi . So, w \u2208 Gi+1 , proving the claim.\nSuppose now that, for some i, w has infinite order in Hi . Let n be the largest\ninteger (possibly zero) such that w \u2208 q n Hi . Set K to be [Gi , Gi ](Gi )q\n16\n\nn+1\n\n. Then G/K is\n\n\fa finite homomorphic image of G in which w is non-trivial. A lemma of Baumslag and\nPride in [2] then asserts that K, and hence G, is large. (Alternatively, one can avoid\nusing this lemma of Baumslag and Pride, by showing directly that K has a presentation\nwith at least two more generators than relations, and then using Corollary 1.3.)\nHence, we may assume that w has finite order in Hi for each i. So, when we quotient\nHi by the relations that are lifts of wq , a Z[G:Gi ]+1 summand remains. Therefore,\nGi /Gi+1 contains (Z/pi Z)[G:Gi]+1 as a summand. So,\nd(Gi /Gi+1 ) \u2265 [G : Gi ] + 1,\n\u0011\n\u0010\nlog[Gi : Gi+1 ] \u2265 log pi [G:Gi ]+1 = ([G : Gi ] + 1) log pi .\nApplying Theorem 1.1 then gives the corollary.\n6. Groups with positive virtual first Betti number\nIn this final section, we establish Theorem 1.5. The implication (1) \u21d2 (2) is straightforward. For, if some finite index normal subgroup G1 of G has infinite abelianisation,\nwe may then find finite index subgroups G1 \u2265 G2 \u2265 . . ., each normal in G1 , so that\n[G : Gi ] grows as fast as we like. In particular, we may ensure that [Gi : Gi+1 ] grows\nsuper-exponentially as a function of [G : Gi ].\nThe implication (2) \u21d2 (1) is a consequence of the following proposition.\nProposition 6.1. Let G be a finitely presented group. Then, there is a constant k with\nthe following property. If H is a finite index subgroup of G, then either its abelianisation\nH/H \u2032 is infinite or |H/H \u2032 | \u2264 k [G:H].\nProof. Pick some finite presentation for G. Let c denote the maximal length of any\nof its relations, and set d to be the number of its generators. Let K be the 2-complex\narising from this presentation. Let K\u0303 \u2192 K be the cover corresponding to a finite\nindex subgroup H. For j = 0, 1, 2, let Cj be the chain group generated by the j-cells\nof K\u0303, and let \u22022 : C2 \u2192 C1 and \u22021 : C1 \u2192 C0 be the boundary maps. Then H/H \u2032\nequals Ker(\u22021 )/Im(\u22022 ). Pick a maximal tree in the 1-skeleton of K\u0303. From this, one can\nconstruct a basis of Ker(\u22021 ), where each element corresponds to an edge not in the tree,\nand is a loop formed by the edge and the path in the tree joining its endpoints. Thus,\nKer(\u22021 ) is a product of [G : H](d \u2212 1) + 1 copies of Z. Now, Im(\u22022 ) is spanned by the\nimages of the 2-cells. Each runs over at most c 1-cells in K\u0303, and so maps to a vector in\nC1 with length at most c. We may suppose that |H/H \u2032 | is finite, and hence that Im(\u22022 )\nis a finite index subgroup of Ker(\u22021 ). Pick a minimal collection C of 2-cells such that\n17\n\n\f\u22022 (hCi) has finite index in Ker(\u22021 ). Then, the images of these 2-cells span a paralleliped\nin Ker(\u22021 ). Denote its volume by V , which equals |Ker(\u22021 )/\u22022 (hCi)|. But |H/H \u2032 | is a\nquotient of Ker(\u22021 )/\u22022 (hCi), and so |H/H \u2032 | is at most V . Since each 2-cell in C maps\nto a vector in Ker(\u22021 ) with length at most c, we deduce that the volume V is at most\nc[G:H](d\u22121)+1 \u2264 cd[G:H] . Thus, the proposition is proved by setting k to cd .\nReferences\n1. B. Baumslag, S. Pride, Groups with two more generators than relators, J. London Math. Soc. (2) 17 (1978) 425\u2013426.\n2. B.
