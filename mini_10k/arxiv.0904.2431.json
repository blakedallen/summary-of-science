In string theory point of view, supersymmetric gauge theory can\nbe realized as a low energy effective theory on D-branes. The low energy behavior of supersymmetric gauge theory has been widely analyzed by using gauge/gravity correspondence. In\nparticular, it has been known that the effective superpotential of N = 1 supersymmetric gauge\ntheory with an adjoint chiral superfield and a tree level superpotential can be evaluated from\nthe gravity theory with flux [1, 2, 3] and from the matrix model [4]. These relations have been\nanalyzed in [5, 6, 7, 8] field-theoretically.\nRecently, some interesting results have been obtained in N = 1 supersymmetric U(N)\ngauge theory with the gauge kinetic term which depends on the adjoint chiral superfield,\nR\nIm d2 \u03b8 Tr \u03c4 (\u03c6)W \u03b1 W\u03b1 . In [9, 10], it has been shown that the effective superpotential of such\n\na theory is deformed compared to the theory with constant \u03c4 (in [9], a specific case where\nN = 2 supersymmetry is spontaneously broken to N = 1 [11, 12] has been analyzed). Since\nthere are non-renormalizable coupling constants, this theory should have UV completion. In\n[13], this theory is obtained as a low energy effective theory on D5-branes wrapped on S 2 's in\nCalabi-Yau 3-fold. The field-dependent gauge kinetic term is introduced by the integrals over\nS 2 's of non-trivial B-field flux which holomorphically varies on the base space (complex plane)\nof Calabi-Yau. By using geometric transition duality, the deformed superpotential [9, 10] has\nbeen derived from the gravity theory [13]. Also, it has been argued that the deformation of the\neffective superpotential leads to the existence of supersymmetry breaking vacua in some cases\nof the parameters. (See also [14] for IIA and M-theory perspectives and [15] for the case with\npartially broken N = 2 supersymmetry.)\nIn this paper, we study N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory with the flavors where the\ngauge kinetic term depends on the adjoint chiral superfields. In the first half of the paper,\nwe analyze N = 1 A-D-E quiver gauge theories. As in [16, 3, 17], N = 1 A-D-E quiver\ngauge theories can be obtained as low energy effective theories on D5-branes wrapped on S 2 's\nin Calabi-Yau 3-folds (and D3-branes in affine case) in IIB string theory. More precisely, these\nCalabi-Yau 3-folds are constructed by fibering the non-singular spaces, which are obtained from\nthe ALE spaces with A-D-E singularity, over the complex plane t. As in [13] for A1 case, the\nnon-trivial B-field flux which depends on t is turned on in order to obtain the field-dependent\ngauge kinetic term.\nAn interesting result of the string theory construction of A-D-E quiver gauge theories is\nthat the theory which is obtained by Weyl reflection on a node of the Dynkin diagram (or\nequivalently quiver diagram) is equivalent to the original one, due to ambiguities from the fact\n1\n\n\fthat there is no unique way to blow up the singularity. Since the nodes of the Dynkin diagrams\ncorrespond to S 2 's, Weyl reflection acts on the gauge kinetic term as well as the superpotential\nin the gauge theory. In [18, 3], it has been analyzed, in the constant \u03c4 case, that the theory\nobtained by Weyl reflection is a dual description (by Kutasov duality [19, 20, 21, 22, 23]), after\nintegrating out the meson fields and the flavors. (See also [24, 25] for the case with antibranes.)\nIn the case which we will consider in this paper, the gauge kinetic term is affected by Weyl\nreflection. Therefore, we propose an extension of the Kutasov duality: N = 1 supersymmetric\nU(Nc ) gauge theory with an adjoint \u03c6 and Nf flavors Q and Q\u0304, equipped with the gauge kinetic\nterm where \u03c4 (\u03c6) is\n\u03c4 (\u03c6) =\n\nm\nX\n\ntk \u03c6k ,\n\n(1.1)\n\nk=0\n\nand a superpotential, has a dual description which is U(nNf \u2212Nc ) gauge theory with an adjoint\n\u03c6\u0303, Nf flavors q and q\u0304 and meson fields, where the gauge kinetic term is\n\u03c4\u0303 (\u03c6\u0303) = t\u03030 \u2212\n\nm\nX\n\ntk \u03c6\u0303k\n\n(1.2)\n\nk=1\n\nand the dual superpotential is the same as the one in [19, 21, 22]. In the latter half of this\npaper, we will analyze this duality from the field theoretical point of view.\nThe dual superpotential and the dual gauge kinetic term can be determined by the consistency of the duality. In particular, a strong constraint is that both theories should split to\ndecoupled SQCD theories at low energy and there exists a corresponding SQCD theory in the\ndual theory which is Seiberg dual [26] to each decoupled SQCD theory in the original one.\nThe duality map of several operators can also verified by using the above argument and the\ngeneralized Konishi anomaly equations. (See also [27] for a different analysis of this theory.)\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. We introduce N = 1 A-D-E quiver gauge\ntheories with the gauge kinetic terms which depend on the adjoint chiral superfields, promoting\nthe gauge coupling constants \u03c4i to the field-dependent functions \u03c4i (\u03c6i ), in section 2. We will\nshow that the classical equations of motion reduce to the same vacuum equations as those in\nthe theories with constant \u03c4i . In section 3, we construct such theories in the framework of\nsuperstring theory. We then consider a duality: Weyl reflection on A-D-E nodes in section\n4. We will see that this induces a non-trivial action on the gauge kinetic term as well as the\nsuperpotential. In section 5, we consider a non-trivial check of the duality proposal. Finally,\nwe will analyze the duality map of the operators, in section 6.\n\n2\n\n\fA-D-E quiver gauge theories\n\n2\n\nIn this section, we introduce N = 1 A-D-E quiver gauge theories. Throughout this paper, we\nconsider the case where the gauge kinetic term depends on the adjoint chiral superfields. This\nis an extended version of the quiver gauge theories considered in [16, 3, 17].\nThese theories are considered as a deformation of N = 2 A-D-E quiver gauge theories\nQ\nwhose gauge groups are i U(Ni ) and each gauge factor corresponds to each node of the quiver\ndiagrams. The quiver diagrams are expressed by the Dynkin diagrams of non-affine or affine\n\nG = A, D, E groups. In terms of N = 1 superfields, N = 2 quiver gauge theory consists of\nthe vector superfields Vi (or the field strength superfields Wi\u03b1 ), the adjoint chiral superfields\n\u03c6i and the matter chiral superfields Qij and Qji which are respectively in the bi-fundamental\nrepresentations (Ni , N\u0304j ) and (N\u0304i , Nj ) of U(Ni ) \u00d7 U(Nj ) groups. (i label the nodes of the quiver\ndiagram.) We consider the case where the prepotential which determines the N = 2 classical\nLagrangian has higher order terms, that is,\nX\nFi (\u03a8i ) =\nk=0\n\nti,k\n\u03a8k+2\n,\n(k + 1)(k + 2) i\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03a8i are the N = 2 vector superfields which contain \u03c6i and Wi\u03b1 and ti,k are complex\nparameters. In N = 1 superspace formalism, this leads to the field-dependent gauge kinetic\nterm\nX\ni\n\nIm\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u03b8 Tr \u03c4i (\u03c6i )Wi\u03b1 Wi\u03b1 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nand also the K\u00e4hler terms. Here \u03c4i are related with the prepotentials as 2\u03c4i (x) = Fi\u2032\u2032 (x).\nWe add the superpotentials Wi (\u03c6i ) which break N = 2 supersymmetry to N = 1. We\nwill choose these superpotentials to be polynomials of the same degree n + 1, for simplicity.\nTherefore, the holomorphic part of the Lagrangian is\n\" Z\n!\n#\nZ\nX\nX\nIm d2 \u03b8 Tr \u03c4i (\u03c6i )Wi\u03b1 Wi\u03b1 + d2 \u03b8 Tr\nsij Qij Qji \u03c6i \u2212 Tr Wi (\u03c6i ) + h.c. , (2.3)\ni\n\nj\n\nwhere sij is the intersection matrix of i-th and j-th nodes, which is zero if the nodes are not\nlinked and \u00b11 if linked (and they also satisfy sij = \u2212sji ). In the affine case, the following\ncondition for the superpotentials:\nr\nX\n\ndi Wi (x) = 0\n\n(2.4)\n\ni=0\n\nshould be satisfied (where di are the Dynkin indices), if we geometrically engineer this theory\n[16]. In the non-affine case, there is no restriction on the superpotentials. Note that in the case\n3\n\n\fwhere ti,k = 0 for k > 0, i.e. constant \u03c4i case, these theories reduce to the ones analyzed in\n[16, 3, 17].\n\n2.1\n\nClassical equations of motion\n\nThe solution of the classical equations of motion in the case where ti,k = 0, for k > 0 (constant\n\u03c4i case) has been derived in [16]. In non-zero ti,k case, the equations of motion are slightly\ncomplicated, but reduce to the same conditions as those in [16]. Let us see this in this subsection.\nFirst of all, it is easy to see that the F-term equations are not changed compared to the\ncase with constant \u03c4i . In fact, the gauge kinetic term which depends on the adjoint chiral\nsuperfields induces an additional term, \u2202\u03c6i \u03c4i (\u03c6i ) multiplied by the fermion bilinear, in the Fterm equations with respect to \u03c6i . However, the fermion does not get an expectation value in\nthe classical vacua which we are interested in. Therefore, this term does not contribute to the\nsolution.\nOn the other hand, the equations of motion with respect to Dia (where a = 1, . . . , Ni2 label\nthe gauge indices of U(Ni ) gauge group) lead to\n#\n\"\nX\ni\n\u2020\n\u2020\nsij (Qij tib Qij \u2212 Qji tib Qji ) + h.c. = 0,\nDia = (fi )abc \u03c6\u0304bi \u03c6ci \u2212 (Im\u03c4i (\u03c6i )\u22121 )ab Tr\n2\nj\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere (fi )abc and tia are the structure constants and the generators in the fundamental of U(Ni ).\nEach matrix (Im\u03c4i (\u03c6i )\u22121 )ab is defined as an inverse of Ni2 \u00d7 Ni2 matrix Tr(Im\u03c4i (\u03c6i )tia tib ). While\nwe have non-trivial factors (Im\u03c4i (\u03c6i )\u22121 )ab in (2.5) compared to the case with constant \u03c4i (in\nthis case, the factors are proportional to \u03b4 ab ), (2.5) results in\nX\n\nsij (Qij Q\u2020ij \u2212 Q\u2020ji Qji ) + h.c. = 0,\n\n(2.6)\n\nj\n\nwhich are the same D-term conditions as those in the constant \u03c4i case. This can be seen as follows. We are interested in the vacua where the scalar fields get the diagonal vev, i.e. non-Cartan\nparts of h\u03c6i i are zero. Under these, the first term of (2.5) is zero. Since det(Im\u03c4i (\u03c6i )\u22121 )ab 6= 0,\nthe solution is trivial and we obtain (2.6).\nWe have shown that the vacuum conditions following from the equations of motion are the\nsame as those in [16]. Therefore, the structure of the classical vacua is also same. So, we only\nexplain these here.\nFor the non-affine case, the solutions of these equations are specified in terms of the positive\nroots \u03c1K [16], where K = 1, . . . , R+ with 2R+ + r = |G| and r is the rank of G. In terms of the\n\n4\n\n\fsimple roots ei , the positive roots can be written as\n\u03c1K =\n\nr\nX\n\nniK ei ,\n\n(2.7)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere niK are some positive integers. The equations of motion reduce to the following equations\nX\nWK\u2032 (x) =\nniK Wi\u2032 (x) = 0.\n(2.8)\ni\n\nEach of these equations has n roots for each positive root \u03c1K because we have chosen every\nsuperpotential is polynomial of degree n + 1. We denote these roots as x = a(p,K) where\np = 1, . . . , n. Then, a supersymmetric vacuum is given by the value of a(p,K) with multiplicities\nM(p,K) \u2265 0 which satisfy\nNi =\n\nR+ n\nX\nX\n\nM(p,K)niK .\n\n(2.9)\n\nK=1 p=1\n\nFurthermore, the gauge group is broken as\nX\nXX\nU(Ni ) \u2192\nU(M(p,K) ),\ni\n\nK\n\n(2.10)\n\np\n\nby Higgsing.\nFor the affine case, we have one additional node in quiver diagram and the gauge group\nPr\nis i=0 U(Ni ) where U(N0 ) gauge group corresponds to that node. The classical vacua are\n\nsimilarly specified by the positive roots as above [16].\n\n3\n\nGeometric construction\n\nThe above gauge theories can be realized as low energy effective theories on D5-branes wrapped\non 2-cycles of Calabi-Yau 3-folds in the non-affine case and additional D3-branes in the affine\ncase. These Calabi-Yau 3-folds are constructed by non-trivially fibering the ALE spaces with\nA-D-E singularity over the complex plane. The important difference between the quiver gauge\ntheory constructed above and the one in [16, 3] is the gauge kinetic term. As considered in\n[13] for A1 case, the field dependent gauge kinetic term can be engineered geometrically by\nintroducing the non-trivial B-field depending on the complex plane which is the base space of\nCalabi-Yau 3-fold.\nWe consider the ALE spaces with A-D-E singularity at the origin, which can be viewed as\nthe hypersurfaces f (x, y, z) = 0 with, e.g. for Ar singularity,\nf = x2 + y 2 + z r+1 ,\n5\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fwhere x, y, z \u2208 C. By deforming these by relevant deformations, we obtain non-singular spaces,\nwhose defining equations are, in Ar case,\nf = x2 + y 2 +\n\nr+1\nr+1\nY\nX\n(z + ti ),\nti = 0,\ni=1\n\n(3.2)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere ti are deformation parameters and there are r independent classes of non-vanishing\nS 2 's. These classes intersect according to the corresponding A-D-E Dynkin diagrams. The\nholomorphic volumes of S 2 's are defined by integrals of the holomorphic 2-form \u03c9 = dxdy/z as\nR\n\u03b1i = S 2 \u03c9. These \u03b1i are simply related to ti in (3.2) by, in Ar case,\ni\n\n\u03b1i = ti \u2212 ti+1 .\n\n(3.3)\n\nFor G = D, E cases, the constructions are similar to the above [16].\nWe consider the fibrations of these spaces over the complex plane. We denote the coordinate\nof this plane as t. If there exists D5-branes wrapping on the above Si2 and occupying the R1,3\ndirection, we obtain 4d non-affine A-D-E quiver gauge theories as low energy effective theories\non the D5-branes, whose field contents are the same as those in section 2. If we include the\nD3-branes occupying R1,3 direction, the gauge theory becomes the affine quiver gauge theory\n[28, 16, 3]. Note that since t plane is orthogonal to the S 2 's on which D5-branes wrap, it\nparametrizes the positions of the D-branes. Thus, t corresponds to the vacuum expectation\nvalue of the adjoint chiral superfield on the D-brane world volume.\nIn type IIB string theory, there are NSNS field B N S and RR field B R . Geometrically, the\ncomplexified gauge coupling of each gauge factor of the quiver gauge theory corresponds to the\nintegral over corresponding Si2 of Calabi-Yau 3-fold:\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u0012\ni NS\n4\u03c0i\n\u03b8\nR\nB + B\n.\n+\n=\n2\u03c0 gY2 M i\ngs\nSi2\nNote that we have set the K\u00e4hler parameters to zero: ri \u2261\n\nR\n\nSi2\n\n(3.4)\n\nk = 0 where k is the K\u00e4hler form.\n\nAs in [16, 3], if the background B-fields do not have any t-dependence, the above quantities\nare constants and denote the complexified gauge coupling constants. On the other hand, if the\nbackground B-fields depend on t as in [13], we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\nZ \u0012\n\u03b8\ni NS\n4\u03c0i\nR\n\u03c4i (t) \u2261\nB (t) + B (t) ,\n+\n(t) =\n2\u03c0 gY2 M i\ngs\nSi2\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhich produce the field-dependent gauge kinetic term of the effective theory on the D-branes, as\nin section 2. The point is that in order not to break the N = 2 supersymmetry, B-fields should\nholomorphically depend on t [29]. Indeed, the dual IIB supergravity solution of this brane\n6\n\n\fset-up, which has N = 2 supersymmetry in 4d, can be obtained assuming that the dilaton is\nconstant. Generically, t-dependent B-fields induce the source term in the dilaton equation of\nmotion. However, such a source term vanishes in the case with holomorphically t-dependent\nB-fields [29]. Therefore, the dilaton remains constant in this case and N = 2 supersymmetry\nis not broken.\nThe superpotentials can be turned on by considering the non-trivial fibration of the ALE\nspace over t-plane, promoting \u03b1i (3.3) to be dependent on t: \u03b1i = \u03b1i (t). These \u03b1i give the\nsuperpotential Wi\u2032 (z) = \u03b1i (z). We only consider the non-monodromic fibration where \u03b1i are\nthe single-valued functions of t as it leads to the single trace functions Wi (\u03c6i ) in section 2. Also,\nwe choose all the degrees of the superpotentials to be n + 1. In this case, there are n points in\nt plane for each positive root \u03c1K (2.7) where the holomorphic volume becomes zero\nWK\u2032 (t) \u2261\n\nr\nX\n\nniK Wi\u2032 (t) = 0.\n\n(3.6)\n\ni=1\n\nThese equations correspond to the conditions for the supersymmetric vacua and are same as\nthose obtained in the gauge theory (2.8). The roots of (3.6) are expressed as t = a(p,K) where\np = 1, . . . n. As noted above, these values correspond to the positions of D-branes and, therefore,\nthe vacuum expectation values of \u03c6i .\nTherefore, we have geometrically engineered the N = 1 A-D-E quiver gauge theories with\nthe field-dependent gauge kinetic term, which have been considered in the previous section.\nThis construction is a simple generalization of A1 case [13] to other quiver cases.\nNow we will comment on an important point which arises from the non-trivial fields background. Note that the background B-fields (3.5) and the positions of D-branes a(p,K) determine\nthe classical gauge coupling constant of each gauge factor U(M(p,K) )\n\u0012\n\n4\u03c0\ng2\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n(p,K)\n\nr\nX\n\nniK Im\u03c4i (a(p,K) ).\n\n(3.7)\n\ni=1\n\nThe crucial point is that, in contrast to the case in [3], these quantities could be negative for\ngeneric choice of the background fields and the superpotentials. This implies that the field\ntheoretical description is ill-defined in that case, but from the string theory point of view, the\ncase where some of the squared gauge coupling constants are negative arises from antibranes\nwrapping on the corresponding S 2 's1 .\n1\n\nIn A1 case, if all the squared gauge coupling constants are negative, a better field theoretical description\n\nwhich is supersymmetry breaking model by spurion fields [30, 31] has been proposed in [13].\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nDuality in string theory\n\nAs considered in [3], there are two types of duality in the above theories. The one is the\ngeometric transition duality [1] and the other one corresponds to Weyl reflection of A-D-E\ngroups. In this paper, we only consider the latter type.\nWeyl reflection about the simple root ei0 of A-D-E group can be viewed as the following\naction on the simple roots:\nei \u2192 ei \u2212 (ei * ei0 )ei0 ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere the inner product of the simple roots is normalized as follows: ei * ei0 are 2 for i = i0 , \u22121\nfor i connected with i0 node and 0 for the other i. In the Calabi-Yau geometry, this corresponds\nto the change of S 2 's and leads to the following action on \u03c4i and the polynomial parts of the\nsuperpotential:\n\u03c4i (\u03c6i ) \u2192 \u03c4i (\u03c6i ) \u2212 (ei * ei0 )\u03c4i0 (\u03c6i ),\n\nWi (\u03c6i ) \u2192 Wi (\u03c6i ) \u2212 (ei * ei0 )Wi0 (\u03c6i ).\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe action of the Weyl reflection on the superpotentials are exactly same as those in [3]. But,\nsince the gauge couplings \u03c4i are polynomials of \u03c6i , the higher order terms in \u03c6i are also affected\nby the Weyl reflection. This induces non-trivial action on the coupling constants ti,k in \u03c4i . In\nfact, in the case with constant \u03c4i , this reduces to the action on the gauge coupling constants,\nas in [3]: (1/g 2)i \u2192 (1/g 2 )i \u2212 (ei * ei0 )(1/g 2)i0 .\nThe different looking gauge theory obtained by Weyl reflection should be equivalent to the\noriginal one from the string theory perspective [3]. This is due to ambiguities which come from\nthe fact that there is no unique way to blow up the singularity and we can determine a quiver\ngauge theory up to Weyl group action. Since the total brane charge must be conserved, the\nranks of the gauge groups after the transition are related with the original ranks as\nX\n\nNi\u2032 e\u2032i =\n\nX\n\nNi ei .\n\n(4.3)\n\ni\n\ni\n\nHence, the ranks of the gauge groups are changed under the Weyl reflection about ei0 as Ni\u20320 =\nNf \u2212 Ni0 and Ni\u2032 = Ni for i 6= i0 where Nf is the number of flavors of U(Ni0 ) gauge theory when\nP\nthe other gauge symmetries are considered as flavor symmetries and Nf \u2261 i6=i0 (\u2212ei * ei0 )Ni .\nNote that the number of flavors is not changed under the Weyl reflection.\n\nAs discussed in [3], this kind of duality can be considered as N = 1 electric-magnetic duality\n[26, 36, 19, 21, 22, 20] in the framework of the gauge theory. (See also [32, 33, 34, 35] for related\napproaches.) However, as seen above, the duality induces the non-trivial action on the fielddependent gauge kinetic term. This is a first example for the electric-magnetic duality in the\n8\n\n\fcase with the field dependent gauge kinetic term. We will call this as extended electric-magnetic\nduality. Fortunately, string theory has suggested that such a duality exists. We will check this\nduality field-theoretically in the subsequent sections.\nBefore going to next, let us see the action on the superpotentials and on \u03c4i more explicitly.\nFirst of all, the action on the superpotentials (4.2) can be written as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nfor i = i0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212Wi (\u03c6i ),\n\u2032\nWi (\u03c6i ) = Wi (\u03c6i ) + Wi0 (\u03c6i ), for i connected with i0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 W (\u03c6 ),\nfor the other i.\ni\n\ni\n\nAlso, for the coefficients of the gauge kinetic terms, Weyl reflection acts as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\nfor i = i0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u2212\u03c4i (\u03c6i ),\n\u2032\n\u03c4i (\u03c6i ) = \u03c4i (\u03c6i ) + \u03c4i0 (\u03c6i ), for i connected with i0 ,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c4 (\u03c6 ),\nfor the other i,\ni\n\n(4.4)\n\n(4.5)\n\ni\n\nLet us concentrate on the gauge theory on the i0 -th node. If we treat the gauge symmetries of\n\nthe linked nodes as the weakly gauged flavor symmetries, we obtain U(Ni0 ) gauge theory with\na superpotential\nn\nX\ngk\nTr \u03c6k+1 + trQ\u0304\u03c6Q + trmQ\u0304Q,\nW =\nk+1\n\n(4.6)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere Q and Q\u0304 are Nf fundamental and anti-fundamental superfields. The symbol tr denotes\nthe trace over the flavor indices. These come from the bi-fundamental superfield connecting\ni0 -th node with the neighboring nodes. The mass term for Q and Q\u0304 is due to \u03c6i\u2032 Qi\u2032 i0 Qi0 i\u2032 term\nof the neighboring nodes by giving a vev of \u03c6i\u2032 . Also, let the gauge kinetic term of this theory\nbe\n\u03b1\n\nTr \u03c4i0 (\u03c6)W W\u03b1 =\n\nn\nX\n\ntk Tr(\u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 ),\n\n(4.7)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere we have simplified the notation of the coupling in \u03c4i0 as ti0 ,k \u2261 tk .\nP\nThe Weyl action changes the gauge group to U(Nf \u2212 Ni0 ) (Nf \u2261 i6=i0 (\u2212ei * ei0 )Ni ) and\nthe superpotential (4.6) to\nf=\u2212\nW\n\nn\nn\nX\nX\ngk\ngk\nk+1\nTr \u03c6\u0303\n+\ntrmk+1 + trq\u0304 \u03c6\u0303q + trmq\u0304q,\nk\n+\n1\nk\n+\n1\nk=1\nk=1\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0303 is an adjoint field of U(Nf \u2212 Ni0 ) gauge group and q and q\u0304 are the Nf fundamentals\nand anti-fundamentals. The minus sign of the first term reflects the Weyl action on the superpotential Wi0 (4.4). The second term comes from the Weyl action on the superpotentials of the\n9\n\n\fnodes linked to i0 node. (The trace of this term is taken over the flavor indices.) Furthermore,\nthe gauge kinetic term of the dual theory becomes\n\u2212\n\nn\nX\nk=0\n\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 ),\ntk Tr(\u03c6\u0303k W\n\n(4.9)\n\nf\u03b1 is the field strength superfield of the dual theory.\nwhere W\n\nIn the theory corresponding to a node connected with i0 -th node, as noted above, the dual\n\nsuperpotential of this theory contributes to the second term of (4.8) because the Weyl reflection\ninduces an additional term Wi0 (\u03c6\u0303i ) (4.4) where \u03c6\u0303i is an chiral superfield of this dual theory.\n\nOn the other hand, the gauge kinetic term is affected as follows:\n\u03c4i (\u03c6i ) \u2192 \u03c4i (\u03c6\u0303i ) + \u03c4i0 (\u03c6\u0303i ) = \u03c4i (\u03c6\u0303i ) +\n\nn\nX\n\ntk \u03c6\u0303ki ,\n\n(4.10)\n\nk=0\n\nas easily extracted from (4.5).\n\n5\n\nExtended electric-magnetic duality\n\nWe have seen that the string theory construction has suggested an extension of N = 1 electricmagnetic duality to the case where the gauge kinetic term depends on the adjoint chiral superfields. In what follows, we concentrate on a particular node of the quiver and consider the\nduality from field-theoretical point of view.\nLet us specify the model. Consider N = 1, U(Nc ) gauge theory with an adjoint chiral\nsuperfield \u03c6 and Nf fundamental and anti-fundamental superfields Q and Q\u0304, and also with a\ngauge kinetic term which depends on the adjoint chiral superfield:\nZ\n\n2\n\n\u03b1\n\nd \u03b8 Tr \u03c4 (\u03c6)W W\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03c4 (\u03c6) =\n\nm\nX\n\ntk \u03c6k ,\n\n(5.1)\n\nk=0\n\nand a superpotential (4.6)\nn\nX\ngk\nW =\nTr \u03c6k+1 + trQ\u0304\u03c6Q + trmQ\u0304Q.\nk+1\n\n(5.2)\n\nk=1\n\nWithout loss of the generality, the mass matrix m can be chosen to be diagonal. We will use\nthe indices f = 1, . . . , Nf to label the flavors. In this notation, the diagonal components of the\nmass matrix are written as mf .\nThe vacua of this theory can be divided into two types: confining and Higgs vacua. Classically, the confining vacua correspond to the vacuum expectation values such that hQi = hQ\u0304i = 0\n10\n\n\fand\nh\u03c6i = diag(a1 , a2 , . . . , aN ),\n\n(5.3)\n\nwhere ai are determined from the solutions of the F-term equation:\nn\nY\nW (x) \u2261 gn (x \u2212 ai ) = 0.\n\u2032\n\n(5.4)\n\ni=1\n\nNote that the other terms contributing to the F-term equation vanish in these vacua. Indeed,\nas we have seen in the quiver case, the gauge kinetic term, \u03c4 (\u03c6)W \u03b1 W\u03b1 , produces an additional\nterm in the F-term equation such as \u2202\u03c6 \u03c4 (\u03c6)\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 where \u03bb\u03b1 is the gluino, but this term vanishes\nbecause we are interested in the vacua where the vacuum expectation values of the fermions\nare zero.\nThe Higgs vacua correspond to the case where some of the diagonal elements of h\u03c6i are\nequal to the mass parameters and Q and Q\u0304 have non-zero vacuum expectation values which\nare determined from the F-term equation:\n(W \u2032 (\u03c6))ij +\n\nX\n\nQfj Q\u0304if = 0,\n\n(5.5)\n\nf\n\nwhere i, j = 1, . . . , N are the gauge indices. As above, the gauge kinetic term does not contribute to the classical equation (5.5).\nIn subsection 5.1, we begin to consider the case without Q\u0304\u03c6Q and mQ\u0304Q terms. In this case,\nthe flavors are massless and, after integrating out the adjoint fields, the theory splits into a set\nof the decoupled SQCD theories with the massless flavors. Therefore, the stable vacua exist if\n[21]\nNc\n\u2264 Nf .\nn\n\n(5.6)\n\nWe will see the dual description of the above theory, after reviewing the constant \u03c4 case. Then,\nwe will turn to the case with full superpotential (5.2) in subsection 5.2.\n\n5.1\n\nSingle trace superpotential case\n\nWe consider the case where the superpotential is\nW =\n\nn\nX\ngk\nTr \u03c6k+1 .\nk\n+\n1\nk=1\n\n(5.7)\n\nWe first review the case where \u03c4 is constant, i.e. tk = 0 for k > 0.

The singlet fields Mi are\nidentified with the meson superfields in the original theory as\nMi = Q\u0304\u03c6i\u22121 Q,\n\ni = 1, . . . , n.\n\n(5.8)\n\nIt is not necessary to introduce the other meson fields corresponding to Q\u0304\u03c6l Q (l > n), since\nsuch fields can be eliminated by the chiral ring relation. In addition, the superpotential of the\ndual theory is [22]\nf=\u2212\nW\n\nk\nn\nn\nX\n1 X X\ngk\nk+1\ngk\nMi q\u0304 \u03c6\u0303k\u2212i q,\nTr \u03c6\u0303\n+ 2\nk\n+\n1\n\u03bc\ni=1\nk=1\nk=1\n\n(5.9)\n\nwhere a parameter \u03bc has been introduced in order for the dimension of the second term to be\ncorrect. This duality is a generalization of the electric-magnetic duality (Seiberg duality) in\nN = 1 SQCD [26] to the case with an adjoint chiral superfield and a tree level single trace\nsuperpotential. Below we refer to the original and dual theories as electric and magnetic theories\nrespectively.\nThe global symmetries of both theories are the same: there is SU(Nf ) \u00d7 SU(Nf ) \u00d7 U(1)R \u00d7\nU(1)J symmetry. The U(1) charges of the fields (and the parameters) of the electric theory are\nin Table 1, where \u039b is the dynamical scale of the electric theory and the superspace coordinate\n\u03b8 also has charge 1. Note that we have allowed the coupling constants gk and tk transform nontrivially, as U(1)R and U(1)J become the symmetries with the superpotential and the gauge\nkinetic term. Also, the charges of the fields of the magnetic theory are in Table 2, where \u039b\u0303 is\nthe dynamical scale of the magnetic theory. A non-trivial check of this duality is to compare\n12\n\n\fthe 't Hooft anomalies of the theories. It has been shown that they perfectly match in the case\nwith the truncated superpotential [21].\nAn important ingredient of N = 1 duality is the matching relation of the dynamical scales.\nIn the case here, the relation is\n\u22122Nf\n\n\u039b2Nc \u2212Nf \u039b\u03032\u00d1c \u2212Nf = gn\n\n\u03bc2Nf .\n\n(5.10)\n\nOne can easily check that this relation is consistent with the above charge assignment. Also, in\n[22], it has been shown that this is consistent with the deformations of the theory by the mass\nterms of the flavors.\nIt is worth noting that, on general grounds, the coefficients of Tr \u03c6\u0303k+1 and Mi q\u0304 \u03c6\u0303k\u2212i q in the\nmagnetic superpotential are generic functions of gk . However, we can fix these coefficients as\nin (5.9). First of all, in the electric theory, according to (5.3), the gauge symmetry is broken\nP\nQ\nto ni=1 U(ri ) where i ri = Nc . (ri denote the number of the eigenvalues of h\u03c6i which are\n\nequal to ai .) Supposing that the underlying U(Nc ) gauge theory is weakly coupled at the mass\n\nscale which is specified by the above superpotential, the theory splits in the low energy into a\nset of decoupled SQCD theories with U(ri ) gauge groups and Nf flavors 2 . In the dual theory,\nthe coefficients of Tr \u03c6\u0303k+1 have been fixed such that the magnetic superpotential has the same\ncritical points ai as those in the electric theory. Then, we observe a similar gauge symmetry\nQ\nbreaking pattern: U(nNf \u2212 Nc ) \u2192 i U(r\u0303i ). The claim is that r\u0303i = Nf \u2212 ri , 3 in order to\n\nobtain one-to-one correspondence between each U(r\u0303i ) SQCD theory and each of the decoupled\n\nSQCD theories in the electric theory under Seiberg duality [26] 4 . Also, the magnetic theory\nshould split to U(Nf \u2212 ri ) SQCD theories with Nf flavors and mesons, as the electric theory\ndoes. This determines the coefficients of Mi q\u0304 \u03c6\u0303k\u2212i q and leads to (5.9) [22].\nMagnetic gauge kinetic term\nWe now turn to the analysis of the gauge kinetic term. We first note that inclusion of the \u03c6dependent part of \u03c4 does not change the structure of the classical chiral ring. The classical chiral\nring relations, i.e. a set of constraints on the gauge invariant operators follows from the F-term\nequation (and a constraint on characteristic polynomial: f (\u03c6) = 0 with f (x) = det(x \u2212 \u03c6)).\nIndeed, as we have seen above, \u03c4 (\u03c6)W \u03b1 W\u03b1 term does not affect the classical solution. On the\n2\n\nThis is the case where all the roots of (5.4) are different from each other. In the case where some of ai\nQr\ncoincide, i.e. W \u2032 = i=1 (x \u2212 ai )ni (r < n), each decoupled theory has a superpotential as Tr \u03c6ni i .\n3\nIn the case corresponding to the above footnote, the corresponding gauge group is U (ni Nf \u2212 ri ).\n4\nIn the case corresponding to the above footnotes, we demand that each decoupled theory in the magnetic\ntheory is related with each decoupled theory in the electric theory by Kutasov duality [19, 21] with the truncated\nsuperpotential\n\n13\n\n\fother hand, the quantum chiral ring is modified by the existence of the field dependent part of \u03c4\nbecause the gluino confines in the confining vacua and leads to the non-zero vacuum expectation\nvalue of h\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 i. We will see this in next section by analyzing the generalized Konishi anomaly\nequations.\nNow, consider the magnetic superpotential. In general, it could depend on tk as well as\ngk . Recall however that the magnetic superpotential has been determined such that it has\nthe same critical points as those of the electric theory and it is consistent with the decoupling\nof the SQCD theories in the magnetic theory. This process can be applied to the case with\nthe field-dependent gauge kinetic term: if the magnetic superpotential depends on tk , we can\nno longer obtain the same critical points. Also, tk -dependent Mi q\u0304 \u03c6\u0303k\u2212i q terms obviously make\ndecoupled SQCD theories to couple each other. Therefore, the magnetic superpotential cannot\ndepend on tk .\nOn the other hand, the gauge kinetic term of the magnetic theory can be written generally\nas\nn\nX\nk=0\n\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 ,\nt\u0303k Tr \u03c6\u0303k W\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhere t\u0303k are some functions of the parameters in the electric theory, which relate the coupling\nconstants of the electric theory with those of the magnetic theory. As the coupling constants in\nthe magnetic superpotential have been fixed such that the magnetic theory correctly behaves\nas the dual of the original one, we have to choose the correct form of the functions t\u0303k (t, g). We\nwill see below that this is simply\nt\u0303k = \u2212tk ,\n\n(5.12)\n\nfor k = 1, . . . , m. The lowest coupling constant, i.e. t\u03030 , can also be determined from the\nmatching relation of the dynamical scales (5.13).\nLet us see (5.12) is indeed the case. We first consider the matching relation of the dynamical\nscales of the electric and magnetic theories. As we have seen above, the matching relation in\nthe case with constant \u03c4 is (5.8)\n\u22122Nf\n\n\u039b2Nc \u2212Nf \u039b\u03032\u00d1c \u2212Nf = gn\n\n\u03bc2Nf .\n\nIn the case with \u03c4 (\u03c6), we can assign U(1)R and U(1)J charges to tk and t\u0303k as\ntk\n\nt\u0303k\n\nU(1)R\n\n\u22122k\n\n\u22122k\n\nU(1)J\n\n0\n\n0\n\n14\n\n(5.13)\n\n\fin addition to the charge assignment in table 1 and 2. It follows from the above global U(1)\ncharges and also the consistency with the mass (of the flavor) deformation as in [22] that this\nrelation cannot change even if we add the parameters tk and t\u0303k to the theory. Therefore, the\nrelation is valid in the case we consider here.\nBy integrating the massive vector superfields and the massive adjoint field out in both\ntheories, the matching relation leads to\n3ri \u2212Nf\n\n\u039bi\n\n3r\u0303i \u2212Nf\n\n\u039b\u0303i\n\n\u2212Nf\n\n= (\u2212)Nf \u2212ri gn\n\n\u03bc2Nf e\u22122\u03c0i(T (ai )+T\u0303 (ai ))\n\nY\n(ai \u2212 aj )\u2212Nf ,\n\n(5.14)\n\nj6=i\n\nfor each i. We have defined as T (x) = \u03c4 (x) \u2212 t0 and T\u0303 (x) = \u03c4\u0303 (x) \u2212 t\u03030 . \u039bi and \u039b\u0303i are dynamical\nscales of U(ri ) and U(r\u0303i ) theories (r\u0303i \u2261 Nf \u2212 ri ), which are defined by the matching of the\ngauge coupling constants:\n\u039b\n\n2Nc \u2212Nf\n\n=\n\n3r \u2212N\n\u039bi i f\n\ne2\u03c0iT (ai ) Y\n(ai \u2212 aj )2rj ,\n\u2032\u2032\nr\ni\n(W (ai )) j6=i\n\nand the similar equations for the magnetic variables. In (5.15),\n\nQ\n\nj6=i (ai\n\n(5.15)\n\u2212 aj )2rj factor comes\n\nfrom the integration of the massive vector superfields and (W \u2032\u2032 (ai ))ri factor is due to the massive\nadjoint field. Furthermore, we add the factor e2\u03c0iT (ai ) because the gauge kinetic term depends\non the adjoint field.\nFinally, we note that the relation (5.14) should be consistent with the decoupling of the\nSQCD theories in the electric and magnetic theories at low energy. This implies that the\nfollowing relations\n3ri \u2212Nf\n\n\u039bi\n\n3r\u0303i \u2212Nf\n\n\u039b\u0303i\n\nNf\n\n= (\u2212)Nf \u2212ri \u03bci\n\n(5.16)\n\nare satisfied for each decoupled SQCD [26], where \u03bci are the parameters in the magnetic superQ\n\u22121 2\n\u22121\npotentials of U(r\u0303i ) SQCD theories, \u03bc\u22121\n=\ni q\u0304i qi Mi . Since we can show that gn \u03bc\ni6=j (ai \u2212 aj )\n\u03bci as in [22], we therefore obtain\n\nm\nX\n\nk\n\ntk (ai ) = \u2212\n\nk=1\n\nm\nX\n\nt\u0303k (ai )k ,\n\n(5.17)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich implies t\u0303k = \u2212tk for k = 1, . . . , m. In principle, (5.17) could have an additional integer\nterm. However, such a term must vanish since there is no way to satisfy the equality with that\nterm. Note that the parameters tk are the values at the energy scale where the gauge symmetry\nis broken.\nNote also that the argument above is valid only in the region where the gauge coupling\nconstant is small. We will see in section 6.2 that (5.12) can be verified by using a different\nmethod.\n15\n\n\f5.2\n\nGeneric superpotential case\n\nBased on the above argument, let us consider the case with more generic superpotential which\nhas been appeared in the string theory construction:\nn\nX\ngk\nW =\nTr \u03c6k+1 + trQ\u0304\u03c6Q + trmQ\u0304Q.\nk+1\n\n(5.18)\n\nk=1\n\nAs discussed in [20, 23], by flowing from the theory considered in the previous subsection or in\n[22], we can deduce that the dual superpotential becomes\nf=\u2212\nW\n\nn\nk\nn\nX\n1 X X\ngk\nk+1\nTr \u03c6\u0303\n+ 2\ngk\nMi q\u0304 \u03c6\u0303k\u2212i q + \u03bbM2 + mM1 .\nk+1\n\u03bc\ni=1\n\n(5.19)\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nBy the relations (5.9), the last two terms correspond Q\u0304\u03c6Q and the mass deformations. What\nwe have to check about this superpotential is whether the deformation terms do not spoil the\nseparation of the SQCD theories or not, as we have discussed in the previous subsection. But it\nis obviously trivial since the last two terms have no room to mix the operators of the different\ngauge factors.\nThe analysis of the dual gauge kinetic term is the same as that of the previous subsection\nand we do not repeat here. The conclusion is t\u0303k = \u2212tk . This is exactly same as what has been\nexpected in the string theory (4.9).\nWhile we have formulated a magnetic dual, the magnetic superpotential (5.19) is different\nfrom the one expected from the string theory duality (4.8). In fact, the dual theory obtained\nby Weyl reflection in string theory does not include the meson fields and the gauge groups are\nalso different: U(Nf \u2212 Nc ) in the stringy dual theory, and U(nNf \u2212 Nc ) in the magnetic theory\nin present section. However, one can show that the magnetic theory reduces to the stringy\ndual one after integrating out the mesons and (anti-)fundamentals and Higgsing to U(Nf \u2212 Nc )\ngauge theory as in [3]. As we have already seen, the gauge kinetic term which depends on\nthe adjoint chiral superfield does not affect the classical equations of motion. Therefore, the\ndiscussion is the same as that in the theory with constant \u03c4 .\n\n6\n\nDuality map of the chiral operators\n\nIn this section, let us consider the duality map between the chiral operators in the electric theory\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 ). As\nand the magnetic ones. First of all, we consider the operators Tr W \u03b1 W\u03b1 (and Tr W\nalready seen above, the matching relations of the dynamical scales of the decoupled SQCD\ntheories are\n\n3ri \u2212Nf\n\n\u039bi\n\n3r\u0303i \u2212Nf\n\n\u039b\u0303i\n\nN\n\n= (\u2212)Nf \u2212ri \u03bci f ,\n16\n\n(6.1)\n\n\ffor each i. In each U(ri ) SQCD theory, the gauge coupling constant receives one-loop correction\nand the gauge kinetic term is renormalized as (3ri \u2212 Nf ) log(\u039bi /M) Tr W i\u03b1 W\u03b1i in the electric\nfi\u03b1 W\nfi in the magnetic theory. If we take a derivative with\ntheory and (3r\u0303i \u2212 Nf ) log(\u039b\u0303i /M) Tr W\n\u03b1\n\nrespect to log \u039bi and use (5.14) as in [36, 22], we obtain the following relations:\nfi\u03b1 W\nfi ,\nTrU (ri ) W i\u03b1 W\u03b1i = \u2212TrU (r\u0303i ) W\n\u03b1\n\n(6.2)\n\nfor each i. These imply that the gauge coupling constant of each decoupled SQCD theory in\nthe electric theory is different by sign from the magnetic one.\nTo check the other relations in terms of more complicated operators, it is convenient to\nuse the generalized Konishi anomaly equations, as in [37] for the constant \u03c4 case. Thus, we\nfirst derive these equations in subsection 6.1. Then, we will consider the duality map of the\noperators in subsection 6.2 and 6.3.\n\n6.1\n\nGeneralized Konishi anomaly equations\n\nLet us derive the generalized Konishi anomaly equations in the electric and magnetic theories.\nWe define the generating functions of the one-point functions in the electric theory as\n\u001d\n\u001c\nW \u03b1 W\u03b1\n1\n,\nTr\nR(z) = \u2212\n64\u03c0 2\nz\u2212\u03c6\n\u001c\n\u001d\n1\nT (z) = Tr\n,\nz\u2212\u03c6\n\u001d\n\u001c\n1\nf\u2032\nf\u2032\nQ\n,\nM(z)f = Q\u0304f\nz\u2212\u03c6\n\n(6.3)\n\nwhere we have ignored the fermionic one-point function.

In the last equation,\nthe flavor index f \u2032 is not contracted.\n5\n\nThese anomaly equations were derived also in [27] recently.\n\n17\n\n\fIn the magnetic theory, we can also define\n*\n\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1\n1\nW\ne\nR(z) = \u2212\nTr\n64\u03c0 2\nz \u2212 \u03c6\u0303\n\u001d\n\u001c\n1\n,\nTe(z) = Tr\nz \u2212 \u03c6\u0303\n\u001d\n\u001c\n1 f\u2032\nf\u2032\nf\n.\nq\nM(z)f = q\u0304f\nz \u2212 \u03c6\u0303\n\n+\n\n,\n\nIn terms of these, the anomaly equations can be obtained as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\n\u2032\ne\ne\nR(z)\n= \u2212 W (z)R(z)\n,\n\u2212\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\ne\ne\ne\ne\nf\n2R(z)T (z) = \u2212 W (z)T (z) \u2212 32\u03c0 i \u03c4 (z)R(z) + M (z)A (z) ,\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\ne = M\nf(z)f A(z)f \u2032\u2032 ,\n\u2212\u03b4ff R(z)\nf\nf\n\n(6.5)\n\n(6.6)\n\n\u2212\n\nwhere\n\nk\nn\n1 X X\nA(z) = 2\nMi z k\u2212i .\ngk\n\u03bc\ni=1\n\n(6.7)\n\nk=1\n\nNote that Mi q\u0304\u03c6k\u2212i q terms in the magnetic superpotential do not contribute to the first equation\nof (6.6) because the terms with q\u0304W \u03b1 and W \u03b1 q are zero in the chiral ring.\nAnother important point of these anomaly equations (6.4) and (6.6) is that the \u03c6(or \u03c6\u0303)e\ndependence of the gauge kinetic term does not affect the anomaly equation for R(z) (or R(z)),\n\nas noted in [9, 10]. In other words, tk and t\u0303k do not enter in those equations. This is crucial in\n\nthe analysis in subsequent subsections.\n\n6.2\n\nDuality map of Tr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 operators\n\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 in the magnetic theory).\nIn this subsection, we consider the operators Tr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W \u03b1 (Tr \u03c6\u0303k W\n\nWe expect from the argument in previous section that the following duality map of the operators\nare satisfied:\n\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 .\nTr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 = \u2212 Tr \u03c6\u0303k W\n\n(6.8)\n\nWe will check this relation in the vacuum. It should be noted that in the case without Q\u0304\u03c6Q\nand mQ\u0304Q terms, the argument in the rest of this section might be invalid. More precisely,\nwe obtain hTr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 i = 0, as we can see from the anomaly equation for M(z). This is\n18\n\n\fbecause the flavors remain massless at IR. Therefore, we will consider the full superpotential\n(5.2) below.\nSince hTr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 i = 0 in the classical vacuum, the classical analysis cannot be non-trivial\ncheck of the duality map (6.8). However, they could have non-zero expectation values in the\nquantum vacuum, as can be seen from the anomaly equations. Indeed, we can relate R(z) to\ne\nR(z)\nby using the generalized Konishi anomaly equations and this will be a non-trivial check\n\nof (6.8). Let us see this below.\n\ne\nThe generalized Konishi anomaly equations (6.4) and (6.6) for R(z) and R(z),\ncan be\n\nrewritten as\n\nR(z)2 = W \u2032 (z)R(z) +\n\nf (z)\n,\n4\n\nf \u0303(z)\ne 2 = \u2212W \u2032 (z)R(z)\ne\nR(z)\n+\n,\n4\n\n(6.9)\n\nwhere f (z) and f \u0303(z) are the polynomials of degree n \u2212 1. These equations can be easily solved\nas\n\u0011\np\n1\u0010 \u2032\n\u2032\n2\nW (z) \u2212 W (z) + f (z) ,\nR(z) =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n1\n\u2032\ne\n\u2212W (z) + W \u2032 (z)2 + f \u0303(z) , (6.10)\nR(z)\n=\n2\n\nwhere the signs of the square roots have chosen to be consistent with the large z behavior of\ne\ne\nR(z) and R(z).\nFrom the above forms, we can see that R(z) and R(z)\nhave cuts in the complex\nz plane and are, respectively, meromorphic functions on Riemann surfaces \u03a3 and \u03a3\u0303 of genus\nn \u2212 1: y 2 = W \u2032 (z)2 + f (z) and \u1ef9 2 = W \u2032 (z)2 + f \u0303(z). Let us denote by \u03b1i and \u03b1\u0303i \u03b1-cycles of \u03a3\nand \u03a3\u0303 respectively.\nThe polynomials f (z) and f \u0303(z) are completely fixed [6] by\nI\n1\n1\ni\u03b1\ni\nR(z)dz,\nhTrU (ri ) W W\u03b1 i =\n\u2212\n64\u03c0 2\n2\u03c0i \u03b1i\nI\n1\n1\ni\u03b1 fi\ne\nf\n\u2212\nR(z)dz.\nhTrU (r\u0303i ) W W\u03b1 i =\n64\u03c0 2\n2\u03c0i \u03b1\u0303i\n\n(6.11)\n\ne\nIt follows from these equations and (6.2) that f (z) = f \u0303(z). Therefore, we obtain R(z) = \u2212R(z),\n\nwhich implies\n\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 i.\nhTr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 i = \u2212hTr \u03c6\u0303k W\n\n(6.12)\n\nNote that this could be an alternative check of the magnetic gauge kinetic term. Indeed, as\nwe have noted above, Mi q\u0304\u03c6k\u22121q terms and the magnetic gauge kinetic term in the Lagrangian do\ne\nnot contribute to the anomaly equation for R(z).\nWhat we have assumed in the above argument\n\nis that the polynomial part of the magnetic superpotential is \u2212W (\u03c6\u0303) and the relations (6.2).\n\nHowever, these follows from that the electric and magnetic superpotentials have the same\n19\n\n\fcritical points and that both theories split into the decoupled SQCD theories at low energy.\nOnce we have derived (6.12), we then obtain the following relations by taking derivatives of the\npartition functions with respect to tk and t\u0303k :\ne\n\u2202Z\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 i \u223c \u2212 \u2202 Z\n\u223c hTr \u03c6k W \u03b1 W\u03b1 i = \u2212hTr \u03c6\u0303k W\n\u2202tk\n\u2202 t\u0303k\n\n(6.13)\n\nSince the duality implies Z = Ze at least for the holomorphic sector, thus we can conclude that\nthe magnetic gauge kinetic term is (5.12).\n\n6.3\n\nDuality map of Tr \u03c6k operators\n\nFinally, we analyze the operator relations between Tr \u03c6k and Tr \u03c6\u0303k . In the theory with constant\n\u03c4 , it has been known [22] that the duality map can be written as\nTr \u03c6k = \u2212 Tr \u03c6\u0303k +\n\nk\u22121\nk X\nMi q\u0304 \u03c6\u0303k\u22121\u2212i q + . . . ,\n\u03bc2 i=1\n\n(6.14)\n\nwhere ellipsis denotes the constant term. In [22], these relations have been checked by substituting the classical vacuum expectation values. Also, they have been analyzed in [37] by using\nthe generalized Konishi anomaly equations. On general grounds, we can expect that these\nf\u03b1 W\nf\u03b1 and the terms involving\nrelations can be deformed by the term with the operators Tr \u03c6\u0303k W\n\ntk , in the case with \u03c4 (\u03c6). Let us show below that such terms do not exist by making use of the\ngeneralized Konishi anomaly equations.\n\nThe third equations of the generalized Konishi anomaly equations (6.4) and (6.6):\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nf\nf\nf e\nf\nf(z) \u2032 A(z)\n\u2212 \u03b4f \u2032 R(z) = M(z)f \u2032 (z + mf ) , \u2212 \u03b4f \u2032 R(z) = M\nf\n\u2212\n\n(6.15)\n\n\u2212\n\nf(z), since R(z) and R(z)\ne\nimply that the tk -dependence cannot enter in M(z) and M\nare independent of tk .

In the constant \u03c4 case, by the\nduality map (6.14), the first equation of (6.16) should reduce to the second equation, as noted\nabove. In the case with \u03c4 (\u03c6), since the only difference between the second terms in (6.16) is\nthe sign, they do not change the duality map (6.14).\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author especially thanks Ken Intriligator for carefully reading the manuscript and giving\nuseful comments.
