Introduction\nPenrose proposed the cosmic censorship hypothesis [1] so as to avoid the possibility of unpredictable influences emerging from the singularity, where physical laws break down. As\nhe put it [2], \"it is as if there is a cosmic censor board that objects to naked singularities\nbeing seen and ensures that they only appear suitably clothed by an event horizon\". Due\nto this conjecture, naked singularities are seldom studied seriously in themselves, though\nvarious discussions focus on the possibility of finding counter-examples to it even for singularities that arise from realistic gravitational collapse processes [3]. The geodesics of\narbitrarily charged particles in a naked Reissner-Nordstrom singularity background are\nstudied in [4]. However, it concentrates on calculating the geodesics only and not on deducing any consequences from them. While attempting to foliate the Reissner-Nordstrom\ngeometry by flat spacelike hypersurfaces [5] for a usual black hole we found it necessary\nto investigate geodesics in a naked singularity background. Here we report on the striking\nsimilarity of the behaviour of these geodesics and the Quantum picture for an electron.\nThe fact that two such apparently different theories as General Relativity (GR) and\nQuantum Theory (QT) come up with unexpectedly similar features seems remarkable to\nus. In particular, GR dealing with point particles seems to require (as will be shown\nsubsequently) that they acquire an extension and that their interactions involve non-local\neffects. This is not to say that we claim that QT derives from GR or vice versa. Rather, we\nnote that the similarity of the pictures suggest that some more fundamental theory yields\nboth. While the spatial extension is, in some sense apparent for a \"clothed\" black hole it\nis not directly apparent for the naked singularity. Since a GR description of an electron\nwould be as a naked singularity, this fact is of importance.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\f2. Timelike Geodesics\nWe start by giving a brief review of unforced timelike geodesics (corresponding to the paths\nof uncharged test particles) in the Reissner-Nordstrom background. The metric is taken in\nthe usual form\nds2 = e\u03c5(r) dt2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c5(r) dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03b8 2 \u2212 r 2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n(2.1)\nwhere e\u03c5(r) = 1 \u2212 2m/r + Q2 /r 2 . The geodesic equation for t gives\ndt\n= \u1e6b = ke\u2212\u03c5(r) .\nds\n\n(2.2)\n.\n\nFor freely falling observers we take k = 1 so as to obtain the flat spacetime value of t at\n.\ninfinity. Had there been a finite velocity at infinity, t would have been greater than unity\nand consequently, we would have to take k > 1.\nFrom Eq.(2.1), for \u03b8 = \u03c6 = constant, we have\ne\u03c5(r) \u1e6b2 \u2212 e\u2212\u03c5(r) \u1e59 2 = 1.\n\n(2.3)\n\nWe can re-write the two requirements, Eqs.(2.2 and 2.3), in a single equation for the change\nof r with t, as\np\n.\nr\n\u00b1 k2 \u2212 e\u03c5(r)\ndr\n= . =\n.\n(2.4)\ndt\nke\u2212\u03c5(r)\nt\nIt is clear that the geodesics will be defined only for e\u03c5(r) < k2 . We see that we must take\nthe negative root, on account of the initial attraction of the gravitational source. If we take\nk = 1, as required for observers falling freely from infinity (initially at rest), then there is\nobviously a boundary at\nQ2\n,\n(2.5)\nrb =\n2m\nat which dr/dt becomes zero and after which the positive root has to be chosen.\nThe geodesics can be better represented in terms of a re-scaled radial parameter,\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\u22121\n\u2217\n\u2212\u03c5(r)\n1 \u2212 2m/r + Q2 /r 2\nr = e\ndr =\ndr.\n(2.6)\n\nHere, the constant of integration is chosen so that r \u2217 = 0 at r = 0. Therefore,\n\n\u2217\n\nr = r + m ln\n\"\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00d7 tan\u22121\n\n\u0013\nr 2 \u2212 2mr + Q2\n2m2 \u2212 Q2\np\n+\nQ2\nQ2 \u2212 m2\n!\n!#\nr\u2212m\nm\np\n\u2212 tan\u22121 p\n.\nQ2 \u2212 m2\nQ2 \u2212 m2\n\nNow, taking k = 1, Eq.(2.4) can be re-written, in (t, r \u2217 ) coordinates, as\nr\n.\u2217\nr\n2m Q2\ndr \u2217\n= . =\u00b1\n\u2212 2.\ndt\nr\nr\nt\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fFigure 1: Two typical geodesics, g1 and g2 ,\nin (t, r\u2217 ) coordinates, for k = 1. Note that\nthey all have the same behaviour, coming in,\nhitting r = rb (shown as a dashed line) and\ngoing back. Also note that they are parallel. The only difference between them is the\ntime at which they hit the classical electromagnetic radius, t = 1, and t = \u22122. (For\ndefiniteness we have taken Q = 2m.)\n\nFigure 2: The same k = 1 geodesics, as\nin Figure 1, in the Carter-Penrose diagram.\nThe behaviour at infinity is made explicit\nhere. They all come from I \u2212 going along\n\u03b8\u2212 , touch r = rb (dashed line) and proceed towards I + along \u03b8+ . The difference\nof the values of \u03c8 and \u03be at which they touch\nthe barrier: \u03c8 = 1.49, \u03be = 0.41 for g1 and\n\u03c8 = \u22122.19, \u03be = 0.16 for g2 (dotted line);\nchanges their appearance in this diagram.\n\nNotice that this would be the speed of light, if it took the value 1. It takes its extremal\nvalues at r = 2rb , namely \u00b1m/Q, which are necessarily less than magnitude 1. Figure 1\nshows the geodesics in a plot of t against r \u2217 . It is clear that the geodesics coming in from\ninfinity turn at r = rb and go back to infinity. Thus, no timelike geodesics from infinity\ncan enter the region r < rb . That region is protected from view by its repulsive nature!\nThese geodesics can be displayed most meaningfully in a Carter-Penrose diagram [6].\nWe consider only the case Q > m. In this case there is only one coordinate patch required,\nand we only need to change coordinates to compactify them. For this purpose we define,\n)\n\u03c8 = tan\u22121 {(t + r \u2217 ) /R} + tan\u22121 {(t \u2212 r \u2217 ) /R} ,\n(2.9)\n\u03be = tan\u22121 {(t + r \u2217 ) /R} \u2212 tan\u22121 {(t \u2212 r \u2217 ) /R} ,\nwhere R is a constant with dimensions of length. Thus r = 0 corresponds to \u03be = 0; r = \u221e\nat t = 0 to \u03be = \u03c0; t = \u2212\u221e to \u03c8 = \u2212\u03c0; t = \u221e to \u03c8 = \u03c0. Hence the Carter-Penrose diagram\nrepresenting the naked Reissner-Nordstrom singularity is an isosceles right-angled triangle\nstanding on its vertex, with the vertical line representing the singularity. Geodesics start at\nI \u2212 , graze the boundary, r = rb , and end at I + . Different geodesics correspond to different\nvalues of \u03c8 and \u03be at which the geodesic grazes the boundary. Some typical geodesics and\nthe boundary, r = rb , are displayed in Figure 2 (taking Q = 2m).\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fFigure 3: Two geodesics in the (t, r\u2217 ) coordinates for k 2 = 1.5, touching the new barrier, rc , at t = 0 (g1 ) and t = \u22121.5 (g2 ). The\ngeodesics are again parallel. Notice that the\nbarrier has gone inwards to r = rc compared\nwith r = rb (dashed line).\n\nFigure 4: The previous k 2 = 1.5 geodesics\nare shown in the Carter-Penrose diagram.\nHere g1 touches rc at \u03c8 = 0, \u03be = 0.34 and\ng2 (dotted line) at \u03c8 = \u22121.96, \u03be = 0.1. The\ngeodesics, again, start at I \u2212 , go along \u03b8\u2212 ,\ntouch r = rc and proceed towards I + along\n\u03b8+ .\n\nFor k > 1, we get geodesics corresponding to an observer with a positive velocity at\n2\ninfinity. Putting\n1 + \u03b5, we find\ni that the geodesics will not turn back at r = rb , but\nh k =p\n2\n2\nrather at rc = \u2212m \u00b1 m + \u03b5Q /\u03b5. It is easily verified that only the +ve root is valid.\nAgain, dr \u2217 /dt takes its maximum value at r = 2rb , but now the extremal values are\nr\n\u0012 \u2217\u0013\ndr\n\u03b5 + m2 /Q2\n.\n=\u00b1\ndt max\n1+\u03b5\nClearly, for small \u03b5 this tends to the previous value, but for large \u03b5 it tends to 1. Now\nthe boundary moves back from rb to rc \u2248 rb \u2212 \u03b5Q4 /8m3 , see Figure 3, and the \"clothed\"\nsingularity appears smaller to a faster moving observer. Note that here k is bounded from\nbelow by 1, but is not bounded from above. In the limit as k goes to infinity, rc goes to\nzero. The geodesics have the same general behaviour as in the previous case. Figure 4\nshows some typical geodesics in the Carter-Penrose diagram for k >h1. p\ni\nFor k < 1 we put k2 = 1 \u2212 \u03b5. The possible reversals are at r\u00b1 = m \u00b1 m2 \u2212 \u03b5Q2 /\u03b5.\n\nIn this case the boundary will move forward from rb to r\u2212 \u2248 rb + \u03b5Q4 /8m3 while the\nlimit at infinity moves back to r+ \u2248 2m/\u03b5, see Figure 5, and the \"clothed\" singularity\nappears larger. These geodesics again start at I \u2212 going along r = r+ and then grazing\nr = r\u2212 and going on to I + along r+ . Again there can be different choices of \u03c8 where the\ngeodesic grazes the inner boundary. Clearly, k is bounded from below by the requirement\nthat (m2 \u2212 \u03b5Q2 ) be +ve. Thus, for a given m and Q, \u03b5 \u2264 m2 /Q2 . At \u03b5 = m2 /Q2 we get\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fFigure 5: Two geodesics in the (t, r\u2217 ) coordinates for k 2 = 0.9. Now the geodesics\nstart at r = r+ (dashed line) in the infinite\npast and go in to r = r\u2212 before going back\nout to r = r+ . We have taken one geodesic,\ng1 , touching the inner boundary at t = 0,\nand the other, g2 , at t = 10. Notice that\nthe inner boundary lies outside the classical\nelectromagnetic radius.\n\nFigure 6: Two geodesics for k 2 = 0.9 in\nthe Carter-Penrose diagram. Here g1 is the\nsame as before (touching r\u2212 at \u03c8 = 0, \u03be =\n0.98) but we have chosen a new geodesic, g3 ,\ninstead of g2 (touching r\u2212 at \u03c8 = 1.43, \u03be =\n0.55), to be able to show the relevant features\nin both diagrams. The latter geodesic would\ntouch r\u2212 at t = 1 in the previous diagram.\nThe geodesics still start at I \u2212 , but now go\nalong r = r+ , touch r = r\u2212 and go on to I +\nalong r = r+ .\n\nr+ = r\u2212 = 2rb . This gives the geodesic as r = 2rb . In the other limit, as k tends to 1 we\nsee that the outer limit, r+ , tends to infinity. In general, the geodesics are bounded by the\ntwo boundariesr = r+ and r = r\u2212 , being asymptotic to the former and tangential to the\nlatter. Some typical geodesics are displayed in a Carter-Penrose diagram, in Figure 6.\nWe need to interpret the significance of k or \u03b5. When k = 1, we have the energy at\ninfinity equal to the rest energy. Thus these geodesics correspond to zero kinetic energy.\nFor k > 1 there is extra energy of motion at infinity and hence these geodesics correspond\nto faster moving observers. However, for k < 1 the energy of motion is less than zero!\n.\nHence these geodesics must correspond to negative energy. In fact, as r \u2192 \u221e, t\u2192 k. Also,\n.\nt corresponds to the ratio of total energy to rest energy. Thus \u03b5 = k2 \u2212 1 corresponds to\n(KE/RE)(2+KE/RE), where KE is the kinetic energy and RE the rest energy, at infinity. In the high energy limit, then, \u03b5 corresponds to (KE/RE)2 , while in the low energy\nlimit it corresponds to 2(KE/RE). In the intermediate energy it comes out approximately\n3(KE/RE). Now k < 1 corresponds to negative \u03b5, and hence negative energy as defined at\ninfinity. It must be borne in mind that these geodesics are never at infinity, but remain\ntrapped near the singularity.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f3. The Electron as a Naked Singularity\nIn gravitational units (c = G = 1), Q = 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221234 cm and m = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u221259 cm for the\nelectron. Thus, if we were to take the general relativistic (GR) description of the electron\nseriously, we must consider it as a naked singularity. Of course, we should really treat\nthe electron as a charged Kerr (or Kerr-Newmann, K-N) singularity and not a ReissnerNordstrom singularity. However, for the present purposes, the essential features are already\nhighlighted by the simpler analysis.\nWe see that here rb is the classical electromagnetic radius, 1.4 \u00d7 10\u221213 ! This is the\nsize the electron would appear to be, to an observer at rest at infinity. However, a faster\nmoving observer would see it shrunk arbitrarily smaller to rc . In the high-energy limit,\n\u221a\nthe size would decrease to Q/ \u03b5, thus decreasing inversely as the kinetic energy. This is\nstrongly reminiscent of QT!\nOne is used to non-local effects in GR, where the global aspect of the theory plays\na fundamental role. Here, there will be non-local effects associated with the electron\ncorresponding to the negative energy paths. In particular, an electron passing through a\nsingle slit will behave differently from one passing through a double slit, because of the\nnegative energy paths that may be blocked or pass through the second slit. Once again,\nstrongly reminiscent of the QT! Remember that the further out the negative energy paths\ngo, the less the energy associated with them. As such, they would be disturbed more\nreadily. Hence, the non-local effects of the electron would be more difficult to maintain\nfurther out.\nSince the negative energy paths can not reach out to infinity, they can not be seen by\noutside observers. What, then, is their significance? They may still be physically relevant\nwhen dealing with the interaction of two electrons. We have no means available of getting\nan exact solution for the two electrons. It seems reasonable to conjecture, however, that\nthe approximate solution would allow the two electrons to interact through their negative\nenergy paths as well as their positive energy paths. This would provide a correction to\nthe usual calculation of the interaction. This is strongly reminiscent of the renormalisation\ncalculation involving virtual particles!\nIt had been demonstrated earlier [7] that for the Kerr metric the total angular momentum and the axial component are well defined, but the other two components are not.\nThis, too, is strongly reminiscent of the QT!\n\n4. Problems - Incorporation of Angular Momentum and Dealing with\nProtons\nIt is clear that we can not neglect the spin angular momentum of the electron. The spin\nangular momentum per unit mass of the electron is, a = 1.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 cm. Thus, if the a\nenters into the calculations like Q, the scale will be literally astronomical. As we have no\nanalysis for the naked K-N singularity so far, we are unable to say whether, or not, the very\nhigh a of the electron would create a problem for us. It seems likely to us that the dragging\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fof inertial frames will change the way a enters into the calculations for the geodesics, as\ncompared with Q.\nThere is another worry. While discussing various aspects of the behaviour of electrons\ntreated as naked singularities we have remarked on its similarity with that in Quantum\nTheory. However, there is no way that Planck's constant can enter into the analysis. Of\ncourse, if we incorporate the spin angular momentum Planck's constant will automatically\nenter, but will not be provided by this analysis.\nIf electrons can be treated as naked singularities, why not protons? If they could be\nso treated, they should have a size of 7 \u00d7 10\u221216 cm. This does not seem reasonable. Since\nthe proton already shows structure at a scale of 10\u221213 cm, it can not be thought of as a\npoint particle. In fact, it is best described as a bound state of three quarks, which could\nperhaps be thought of as three point particles. It would not, then, be described by one,\nbut three, naked singularities close together. Further, these singularities would not be\nReissner-Nordstrom singularities, but Einstein-Yang-Mills singularities. Clearly, there can\nbe no exact description of this situation. Though there is a solution available [8] to the\nEinstein-Yang-Mills equations for a single source, it is not exact. (In fact it does not even\nhave a singularity, though it is a solution for a point source.) As such, there is no reason\nto suppose that the existence of the proton poses a problem for our argument treating the\nelectron as a naked singularity. It must be admitted, however, that there is much work\nrequired to verify whether this proposal would be workable in a more general context, not\nonly including the K-N, but other naked singularities and finding methods for dealing with\napproximate solutions rigorously.\n\nAcknowledgments\nOne of us (AQ) is most grateful to David Finkelstein for very valuable criticism of the\nmanuscript and Prof. Remo Ruffini for hospatility at ICRA, where he got the opportunity\nto meet Prof. Finkelstein.\n\nReferences\n[1] See, for example, R.
