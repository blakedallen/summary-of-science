However, two problems\nassociated to the point-like nature of dark matter are\nthat the resulting gravitational collapse shows a central\ndensity profile that is not flat and on the other hand it\npredicts a non-observed amount of small structures. An\nalternative to ameliorate these two problems consists in\nassuming that the dark matter is made of an ultralight\nspinless particle, the so called Scalar Field Dark Matter\nModel (SFDM). In the cosmological frame, the analysis\nof such hypothesis indicated that the power of structures\ncould be controlled through a parameter in the model,\nthat is, the mass of the scalar field representing the spinless particle [1, 2, 3, 4]. Once the mass m of the boson\nis fixed the power spectrum suffers a cutt-off according\nto the mass of the smallest structure desired. An interesting assumption in such analysis is that the scalar\nfield potential was a cosh-like potential, that behaved as\nan exponential at early times and as a free field case\n(quadratic potential) at late times, whose behavior was\nthat of the usual cold dark matter model. Moreover, it\nwas found that the SFDM enjoys the same advantages\nat cosmic scale as the standard lambda cold dark matter\nmodel.\nBecause the SFDM requires the existence of a fundamental scalar field for its reliability, it is natural to consider that this scenario fits very well within unification\ntheory scenarios and braneworld models [5]. This by itself is a good enough reason to consider the SFDM as an\nalternative powerful model, because it contains intrinsically the spinless boson as dark matter particle. However,\nonce at cosmic scales the model matches with observations, it is necessary to study the predictions of the model\nat structure scales. In this sense there have been several\nresults indicating that the model is good also at galactic\n\nscales and here we briefly summarize such results.\nAt the early stages of the galactic dark matter model,\nfully general relativistic stationary solutions were proposed to explain the phenomena like the flatness of rotation curves, assuming the scalar field was real [6, 7],\nnon-topological scalar field dark halos[8] complex scalar\nfields[9] and global monopoles [10]. Later on, the assumptions relaxed to the newtonian limit of such general\nrelativistic models. By the time, quintessential dark matter halos [11, 12, 13] and the fluid dark matter made of\nscalar fields was proposed as an alternative galactic dark\nmatter model[14] and the collapse of fuzzy dark matter\nmade of a scalar field was analyzed in one dimension[15].\nOn the other hand, the assumption of time independence was also relaxed and scalar field dark matter halos\nwere proposed to be gigantic Oscillatons, that is, time\ndependent fully relativistic scalar field solutions to the\nEinstein-Klein-Gordon system of equations [16, 17].\nCurrently what appears to be the interesting case is\nthat of the time dependent newtonian limit of the model,\nthat is, the Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson (SP) system of equations\nwould describe the model at local scales. In this direction relevant results have been found, for instance: it was\nshown that when the evolution of a structure of galactic\nmass is followed after the turnaround point, it quickly\nvirializes and tends to a stationary equilibrium solution\nof the SP system of equations, whereas one of the size\nof a supercluster would still be relaxing at the present\ntime[18]; the condition is that the mass of the boson\n(m \u223c 10\u221223 eV) is the one that better cuts-off the power\nspectrum at galactic scales as shown in [1, 2, 3]. Thus,\nat the moment the pieces of the model seem to match\nboth, at cosmic and at local scales. In fact, recently\nin [19] it was shown that the scalar field gravitational\ncollapse tolerates the introduction of a self-interaction\nterm in the potential, which makes the model to seem\nquite like a self-gravitating Bose-Condensate. In [20] we\nshowed that spherically symmetric equilibrium solutions\nof the SP system are stable against non-spherical perturbations, and moreover, such configurations played the\nrole of late-time attractors for initially quite general ax-\n\n\f2\nisymmetric initial density profiles.\nWhat we present here is a step forward in the direction of studying the evolution of scalar field structures.\nWe perform numerical studies of scalar binary configurations, as a first step towards the making of a numerical\ncode with no symmetries and for N-scalar objects. These\nstudies would tell us about possible restrictions on selfinteraction terms for the scalar field, and the way single\nconfigurations interact with each other. We restrict ourselves to the case of head\u2013on interaction, which can be\nhandled with a 2D code with axi-symmetry. We choose\nto write down the SP in cylindrical coordinates:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202\u03c8\n1 \u22022\u03c8\n\u2202 2\u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8\n+\n= \u2212\n+\n+ U \u03c8 + \u039b|\u03c8|2 \u03c8(1)\n\u2202t\n2 \u2202x2\nx \u2202x\n\u2202z 2\n\u22022U\n1 \u2202U\n\u22022U\n+\n= \u03c8 \u2217 \u03c8.\n(2)\n+\n2\n\u2202x\nx \u2202x\n\u2202z 2\ni\n\nwhere \u03c8 = \u03c8(x, z, t) and U = U (x, z, t) are the wave\nfunction and the gravitational potential respectively; x, z\nare the radial and axial cylindrical coordinates respectively. The third order term in Eq. (1) is related to a\nself-interacting term, in which \u039b corresponds to the swave scattering length in the Gross-Pitaevskii approximation for Bose Condensates [21]. This term was shown\nto play the role of determining the compactness of the\nstructure [19]. Equations (1-2) use the units and scaling ~ = c = 1 with x \u2192\n\u221a mx, z \u2192 mz, t \u2192 mt and\nthe wave function \u03c8 \u2192 4\u03c0G\u03c8, where m is the mass\nof the ultralight boson. As a consequence of this change\nof units is that the mass of a system will be in units of\n2\n[M ] = Mpl\n/m as found also for fully relativistic boson\nstar solutions [19, 22]; this implies that the value m sets\nthe physical lenght and time scale of the configuraions\nevolved. This mass, together with the scaling relations\nof the Schr\u00f6dinger-Poisson system [18, 20, 23] are the basics for transforming back to physical units the system of\ninterest (see an exmple below).\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section\nwe briefly describe the code used. In section III we construct initial data containing two spherically symmetric\nequilibrium configurations along the z axis. In section\nIV we show the results for the head-on interaction of the\ntwo structures. Finally in section V we draw some conclusions.\n\nII.\n\nNUMERICAL METHODS\n\nThe evolution. The most common numerical technique\nfor time-integrating Eq. (1) is implicit with alternating\ndirection splitting of the evolution operator [24, 25]. The\nreason for this is that the evolution operator is unitary.\nNevertheless, we used such method in [23], where no\nneed for splitting the operator on the right hand side of\nEq. (1) was needed; in [19, 20] it was shown that explicit\nmethods preserve also the number of particles and no\n\nsignificant difference in the results is found after using\none method or the other. For the present case an explicit\napproximation of the full implicit method (in practice, a\nmodified iterative Crank-Nicholson method [17]), with\nsecond order finite differencing to calculate the spatial\nderivatives is used. The reason to avoid using the\nimplicit method is the difficulty to reduce the evolution\noperation to a tridiagonal system of equations when\nconsidering a non-zero \u039b, which makes the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation a non-linear one, a situation not descussed in\n[24, 25].\nPoisson equation. Equation (2) is an elliptic equation for U which we solve using the 2D five-point stencil for the derivatives and a successive over-relaxation\n(SOR) iterative algorithm with optimal acceleration parameter (see e.g.[26] for details about SOR). In order to\nimpose boundary conditions we made sure\nR the boundaries were far enough for the mass M = |\u03c8|2 d3 x to be\nthe same along the three faces of the domain and used\nthe monopolar term of the gravitational field; that is,\nwe used\n\u221a the value U = \u2212M/r along the boundaries with\nr = x2 + z 2 . At the axis we demanded the gravitational\npotential to be symmetric with respect to the axis.\nWe use a sponge in the outermost region of the domain. The sponge is a concept used with success in the\npast when dealing with the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (for detailed analyses see [23, 27]). This technique consists in\nadding up to the potential in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nan imaginary part. The result is that in the region where\nthis takes place there is a sink of particles, and therefore\nthe density of probability approaching this region will be\ndamped out, with which we get the effects of a physically\nopen boundary.\nBasic testbeds of this code evolving single equilibrium\nconfigurations can be found in [20], where the results\nare also compared with previous studies with spherical\nsymmetry and linear perturbation theory.\n\nIII.\n\nINITIAL DATA\n\nDetails about the construction of initial data for spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations can be found\nin [19, 20, 23]. Here we briefly mention the procedure\nused in our binary case. What we do is to superpose two\nspherically symmetric ground state equilibrium configurations upon the same 2D axially symmetric grid, whose\nconstruction is described as follows. In spherical symmetry equations (1,2) read\n1 2\n\u2202 (r\u03c8) + U \u03c8 + \u039b|\u03c8|2 \u03c8\n2r r\n\u2202r2 (rU ) = r\u03c8\u03c8 \u2217 .\ni\u2202t \u03c8 = \u2212\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\n\u221a\nwhere r = x2 + z 2 . If a time dependence of the type\n\u03c8 = \u03c6ei\u03c9t , regularity at the origin, and an isolation con-\n\n\f3\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nIn order to solve these equations we discretize them and\nuse a shooting method that bisects the value of \u03c9 so that\nthe boundary conditions hold with certain desired accuracy. The solutions constructed in this way are called\nequilibrium configurations. For each value of \u039b it is possible to construct the whole branch of equilibrium configurations as shown in [19]. However there is an extra\ningredient in these solutions: the number of nodes of the\nwave function. When the wave function is nodeless we\nsay it belongs to the ground state; when the wave function has a given number of nodes we can construct also\nthe branches of solutions that -by analogy with the particle in a box- are called excited spherical states. However,\nas shown in [19, 23] such excited states are unstable and\ndecay into ground states; in fact ground states are stable\nand late-time attractors for quite arbitrary initial wave\nfunction profiles [19, 20]. Because the excited states are\nunstable and decay in a short time scale we collide in the\npresent task only ground state configurations.\nOnce we account with these ground state data: i) we\ninterpolated the wave function of such configuration centered at (0, z0 ), ii) we place another of these equilibrium\nconfiguration at the point (0, \u2212z0 ), iii) we choose z0 so\nthat the two configurations are far enough one from the\nother (see below) and iv) resolved Poisson equation (2).\nThen we have initial data for two ground state equilibrium configurations in our axially symmetric domain.\nSummarizing, we choose to solve the initial value problem in spherical coordinates to make sure that we start\nthe evolution with very accurate values, and we evolve in\na 2D grid using cylindrical coordinates because we found\nthem necessary and practical for the binary case we are\ninterested in.\nSpecial warning is needed in Eq. (1), because it is nonlinear for the \u039b 6= 0 case, which indicates that the superposition of two wave functions is not allowed. Assume\n\u03c81 and \u03c82 represent the solutions of the initial spherically symmetric configurations that are to be superposed\nonto the 2D grid; the density of probability in (2) for the\ntotal wave function \u03c8 = \u03c81 + \u03c82 is |\u03c81 + \u03c82 |2 and unless these states are orthogonal one cannot consider the\nnaive superposition above is allowed. Thus we choose\nthe distance between the configurations such that the interference (given by the scalar product of the two wave\nfunctions) < \u03c81 , \u03c82 > is of the order of the precision of\nour calculations, say, in our case, the precision of the interpolation of the data into the 2D grid. Thus we can\nthink of the system as one made of two adequately superposed equilibrium configurations we want to collide.\nAn example of the interference term is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe superposition of configurations by itself would say\nlittle about whether or not two configurations collide.\n\n1.4\n\nLocation z=-10, z=10\nLocation z=-15, z=15\n\n1e-06\n\nLocation z=-10, z=10\nLocation z=-15, z=15\n\n1.2\n\n1e-08\n\n1\n\nInterference\n\n\u2202r2 (r\u03c6) = 2r(U \u2212 \u03c9) + 2\u039b|\u03c6|2 \u03c6 ,\n\u2202r2 (rU ) = r\u03c62 .\n\nWe add an extra ingredient to the system, that is, an\ninitial head-on momentum to the initial scalar field balls.\nWe simply generate different initial kinematical states by\nassigning new values to the wave functions of the equilibrium configurations: \u03c81 \u2192 \u03c81 eipz z and \u03c82 \u2192 \u03c82 e\u2212ipz z .\nThe resulting physical situation involves a considerable\nchange in the value of the expectation value of kinetic\nenergy in the system.\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c1\n\ndition \u03c6(r \u2192 \u221e) = 0 are assumed, the system becomes\nan eigenvalue problem for \u03c6 with eigenvalue \u03c9:\n\n0.6\n\n1e-10\n\n1e-12\n\n1e-14\n\n0.4\n1e-16\n0.2\n1e-18\n0\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\nz\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nz\n\nFIG. 1: (Left) An example of two ground state configurations\nsuperposed along the z\u2212axis with two different separations.\n(Right) The interference < \u03c81 , \u03c82 > is shown for two cases.\nDifferent separations are used and the two configurations have\na central field value \u03c8(0) = 1.0. The initial head-on momentum is pz = 3.0.\n\nFortunately, in the present Newtonian low energy\nregime it is possible to estimate expectation values of\nphysical quantities, a property difficult to pose in the\nfully general relativistic case. For instance, we account\nwith the observables that allow one to monitor the evolution of the physical situation. Because we deal with\na quantum mechanical system, we simply estimate the\nexpectation values of the following interesting operators:\n\nZ\n1\nK = \u2212\n\u03c8 \u2217 \u22072 \u03c8d3 x\n2\nZ\n1\n\u03c8 \u2217 U \u03c8d3 x\nW =\n2\nZ\nI =\n\u039b|\u03c8|4 d3 x\n\n(7)\n(8)\n(9)\n\nwhich are the expectation values of the kinetic, gravitational and self-interaction energies. These quantities are\nquite important at determining the state of the system at\nany time during the evolution of the system. That is, the\nvalue of the total energy E = K+W +I indicates whether\nwe account with a bounded system or not, and the very\nimportant virial theorem relation 2K + W + 3I = 0 [28],\nwhich is nearly satisfied when the system gets virialized\nand relaxed through whatever channels available, for instance, the emission of scalar field bursts, the so called\ngravitational cooling.\n\n\f4\nIV.\n\nHEAD-ON COLLISIONS AND SOLITONIC\nBEHAVIOR\n\nA.\n\n2\nt=0\n\nt=1\n\nt=2\n\nEqual mass case\n\nThe first scenario one might think of is the collision of\ntwo equal mass ground state configurations. In Fig. 2\nwe show snapshots of the density profile along the z-axis\nfor an initial configuration with pz = 3.0 and z0 = 15 in\nthe free field case (\u039b = 0). What is found is that the\ntwo blobs move toward each other and eventually they\nlie upon each other, an interference pattern gets formed\nand after a while one blob moves toward the left and the\nother one toward the right. The first interpretation is\nthat the initial data behave like solitons. Unfortunately\nwe cannot be confident about the solitonic behavior because the shape of the blobs gets deformed after the \"collision\" and an increase of the amplitude and shrink in the\nwidth are manifest. After the distributions approach the\nboundary (located at z = \u00b130) the density of probability is absorbed by the sponge and its integral M drops\nto zero. At this point we are unable to track the evolution further in time and we ignore whether the blobs\nmight return and collide again and repeat such process as\nmany times as desired until there is energy released (e.g.\nthrough the emission of scalar field) and the encounters\nget damped allowing eventually a true collision. In Fig.\n3 we show a zoom of the interference pattern at the time\nwhen superposition of the configurations around t \u223c 5\noccurs.\nOf course, not all the initial configurations constructed\npresent this behavior and we have found that a criterion to decide whether this behavior is allowed or not\nis the value of the total energy E = K + W + I. In\nFigs. 4 and 5 we show the total energy of different types\nof initial configurations. In Fig. 4 we present different\nsituations for the free field case \u039b = 0 and two particular cases: pz = 1.0 and pz = 0; in the first case the\nsolitonic behavior is achieved and the total energy is always positive and approaches zero because the density\nof probability has left the numerical domain; in the second case the total energy is always negative and at the\nend of the day what is found is that there is a single\nblob in the middle, indicating that the system is oscillating around a bounded object. We show snapshots of\nthis behavior later when dealing with the more interesting unequal mass case. About the other cases in this\nplot pz = 0.75, 0.71, 0.7 we cannot decide whether they\nshow solitonic behavior or not in the time we used to run\nour simulations and we can only observe that the density\nprofiles are severely distorted by the collision.\nIn Fig. 5 we show the same criterion for configurations\nwith the self-interaction term (\u039b = 0.2). Again, when the\ntotal energy is extremely positive or extremely negative\nwe are able to decide whether the configurations collide\nor they trespass each other.\n\n1\n\n0\n2\nt=3\n\nt=4\n\nt=5\n\n1\n\n0\n2\nt=6\n\nt=7\n\nt=8\n\n1\n\n0\n2\nt=9\n\nt=10\n\nt=11\n\n1\n\n0\n-15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n-15\n\n0\n\n15\n\n-15\n\n0\n\n15\n\nFIG. 2: Snapshots of the density of probability for interaction between two initial configurations with \u039b = 0, pz = 3.0\nand z0 = 15. The configuration shows solitonic behavior due\nto the fact that the total energy is always positive of the order of E \u223c 32 until the blobs get absorbed by the sponge.\nThe numerical domain used is x \u2208 [0, 30], z \u2208 [\u221230, 30] with\nresolution \u2206x = \u2206z = 0.125.\n\nB.\n\nUnequal mass case\n\nThe unequal mass case helps at deciding whether the\nconfigurations in the above examples truly trespass each\nother or bounce. In fact up to now it is not possible\nto say anything about this because of a few reasons: i)\nthe expectation absolute value of the linear momentum\nalong the head-on direction is equal for both half planes\nz > 0 and z < 0, ii) the mass in each half plane is also\nthe same in both semiplanes, iii) the expectation value\nof the linear momentum in the head-on direction is zero\nall the time.\nIn the unequal mass case we have the advantage of\nbeing able to distinguish the half planes masses and linear\nmomentum. In Fig. 6 we show snapshots of the unequal\nmass case for \u039b = 0.2 and initial parameters pz = 3.0\n\n\f5\n\u03c1\n\n\u039b=0, z0=10\n\n4\n\npz = 2.0\npz = 1.0\npz = 0.75\npz = 0.71\npz = 0.7\npz = 0.0\nEnd points\n\n3.5\n3\n\n3\n2.5\n2\n\n2\n\nE=K+W+I\n\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\nx\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n6\n7\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nz\n\n-3\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\nt\n\nFIG. 3: The pattern of interference formed during the collision of two configuration with \u039b = 0, z0 = 15, pz = 3.0 (the\nsame case as in the previous figure). After this stage, the two\nblobs continue their way in the initial direction and behave\nas solitons (see Fig. 2). They are not strict solitons because\nthey slightly deform during the process.\n\nand z0 = 15 that show solitonic behavior with E > 0\nall the way. It can be seen clearly that the initial blobs\nare actually trespassing each other although they suffer\na profile deformation until the wave function reaches the\nsponge region.\nIn Fig. 7 we show the mass transfer from the z > 0 to\nthe z < 0 half planes and viceversa; notice that the mass\ntransfers from one side to the other in a very effective\nway. We also show the expectation value of the linear\nmomentum along z in both half planes; what is found is\nthat the momentum is also transfered from one side to\nthe other. The perfect solitonic behavior would consist\nof having these two properties plus the unachieved one\nrelated to the preservation of the density profile.\n\nFIG. 4: The total energy E = K + W + I for different initial parameters, all of them with \u039b = 0 and z0 = 10. The\nconfigurations with pz = 2.0, 1.0 start evolving with high values of the total energy, and show solitonic behavior; the total\nenergy tends to zero once the density of probability (the partciles) gets out of the numerical domain, which happens by the\ntime indicated with the star for such run. The configuration\nwith pz = 0 remains with clearly negative total energy, so\nthat the system is bound and the system collides, in the sense\nthat there is no solitonic behavior and instead the two blobs\nget glued and remain like that. We are unable to conclude\nanything about the borderline cases. The stars at the end\nof borderline cases indicate the point at which we stoped the\nruns. The reason is that the lenghtscale of such cases is pretty\nmuch that of our numerical domain, and one expects the truning points of the blobs to be at a distance of the order of the\ndomain size. By the time indicated with a star, there is burst\nof particles, related more to the fact that the blobs are returning bach to the domain than to a burst of particles due\nto the relaxiation of a single blob or to the fact that the blobs\nare leaving completely the domain.\n\n\u039b=0.2, z0=15\n\n3\n\nUnequal mass pz=3.0\n\n2.5\n\nC.\n\nAn example of collision\n\np z=\n\n2\n\nE=K+W+I\n\n1.5\n\nAs a final result we show what happens when an initial\nconfiguration presents a negative total energy. In Fig. 8\nwe show the density profile along z for a collision case\ncorresponding to \u039b = 0, z0 = 10 and pz = 0, that is,\nonly the pure gravitational force drives the dynamics of\nthe binary. It can be observed that the blobs actually\nmerge and remain sitting on a fixed point around the\ncenter of mass, the density tends to get stabilized, the\nvirial relation starts oscillating aorund zero with smaller\namplitude, the total energy starts stabilizing, so as the\nmass of the system.\nIn order to ullistrate what our results mean in physical\nunits we use the run in Fig. 8 to estimate the time-scale\nfor the collision of binary equal mass head-on case. We\nstart from the fact that the mass of ground state configurations is M \u223c 1011 M\u2299 and the mass of the boson is\nm = 10\u221223 eV; the separation is 20 \u223c 3.52kpc and the\ntime the density peak is maximum is tcollision \u223c 52.5 \u223c\n\n1.0\n\npz= 0.755\np z=\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nEnd points\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n-1.5\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nt\n\nFIG. 5: The total energy E = K + W + I for different initial\nparameters, all of them with \u039b = 0.2 and z0 = 15.

The configuration evolved\nconsists of two superposed ground state configurations with\n\u039b = 0.2, and respective central field values \u03c8(0, 0) = 1, 0.7\nand masses M = 2.437, 1.9383. The initial linear momentum\nis pz = 3.0. The density of probability reaches the edges of the\nnumerical domain and vanishes. The total energy is always\npositive.\n\naction between two ground state configurations (spherical both of them) [19].\nWe found that the initial blobs show solitonic behavior\nof the initial configuration, but that also the two configurations may collide. The system ends up colliding\nwhenever the total energy of the system E < 0 and the\nsolitonic behavior appears when E > 0. Unfortunately\nwe can show this only for clearly non-zero values of the\nenergy in each case and we cannot conclude anything\nabout the borderline case, that is, when E \u223c 0, because\nour simulations are unable to resolve the system for the\nquite long time needed and the spatial domain used.\nWithin the scalar field dark matter paradigm, the two\ninitial blobs would represent two virialized structures\nmade of dark matter.
