We\nmap the ZZ and FZZT D-branes in the c = 1 string theory at self dual\nradius to the localized and extended branes in the topological theory\non the cigar. We show that the open string spectrum on the branes\nin the two theories are in correspondence with each other, and their\ntwo point correlators are equal. We also find a representation of an\nextended N = 2 algebra on the worldsheet which incorporates higher\nspin currents in terms of asymptotic variables on the cigar.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt was shown in [1] that the topological string theory on the coset SL(2, IR)1 /U (1)\n(the cigar at supersymmetric\u221a\nlevel one) is equivalent to the c = 1 non-critical\nbosonic string at radius R = \u03b1\u2032 .1 In the last few years, there has been a lot\nof progress [41, 33, 37, 39, 38] towards the full solution of the SL(2, IR)/U (1)\ncoset theory. Using these results, a large class of closed string correlation\nfunctions of the two theories were explicitly checked to agree [27]. We extend\nthis map and identify the respective D-branes of the two theories with each\n1\n\nRecent work [40] maps the topological cigar at arbitrary level k to bosonic non-minimal\nc < 1 matter coupled to Liouville.\n\n1\n\n\fother, by observing that the one-point functions defining boundary states in\nthe c = 1 string coincide with the topological couplings of boundary states\nin the cigar, and that the spectrum and two point functions of the open\nstrings on these branes are equal.\nBefore discussing the open string theories, we clarify aspects of the equivalence of the cohomologies of the topological coset and the c = 1 bosonic\nstring theory. Using the analysis of null vectors in Verma modules of affine\nSL(2, IR), we identify the origin of the bosonic string cohomology in the\nsupercoset Hilbert space2 . We thereby reproduce and clarify the relation\nbetween the analysis of the cohomology as described in the appendix of [1]\n(by E. Frenkel) and the identification of certain explicit representatives of\nthe c = 1 string cohomology in [1].\nIt was observed in [1] that all values of the SL(2, IR) quantum number j\nsuch that 2j \u2208 ZZ have to be included for the map of closed string operators\nbetween the c = 1 string and the coset to work. However it was shown in\n[23] that the Hilbert space for string theory on the parent SL(2, IR) theory\nwhile\nis obtained by restricting j to be in the range3 \u2212 12 \u2265 j > \u2212 k+1\n2\nallowing for all spectrally flowed sectors. The spectrum of the coset theory\nis obtained by descent from the same (restricted) parent Hilbert space[16].\nFor k = 1, this Hilbert space for the discrete representations is given by\nP\n+,w\nw D\u2212j= 1 , w \u2208 ZZ (for the left-movers). We show that those topological\n2\n\nclosed string observables found in [1] with j outside the unitary range can\nbe written as operators descended from j = \u2212 12 in spectrally flowed sectors.\nWe then turn to the open string sectors of the two theories. The c = 1\nmodel has two types of branes \u2013 the first type (ZZ branes [45]) is localized\nin the strong coupling region and is parameterized by two integers (m, n).\nOut of these, only the first in the series, the (1, 1) brane, is unitary in\nthe Lorentzian theory. The second type (FZZT branes [10, 42]) extends\nto infinity towards the weak coupling end of the Liouville direction, and\ndissolves at a finite value of the Liouville coordinate. These branes are\nparameterized by a continuous complex parameter \u03bcB whose absolute value\nmeasures the position where the brane dissolves.\nThe cigar theory has branes which are zero, one and two dimensional.\nThe unitary B-branes which we consider are of two kinds: the D0-branes,\nwith no continuous parameter, which are localized near the tip of the cigar\n2\n\nThe observation that an SL(2, IR) current algebra appears in the context of light-cone\n2D gravity was already made in [32, 22]. There, the relation between c = 1 observables\nand degenerate representations of SL(2, IR) is also mentioned briefly.\n3\nIn our conventions, where k here is the supersymmetric level.\n\n2\n\n\fand carry a charge under the RR zero form4 ; and the D2-brane, filling\nthe cigar, that are parameterized by a continuous parameter \u03bc\u0303B which also\nmeasures the extent of the brane towards the tip. We show that the onepoint functions for both the localized/extended branes when restricted to the\ntopological sector of the coset agree respectively with those of the ZZ/FZZT\nbranes of the c = 1 string.\nWe then proceed to compare the open string chiral primaries on the\ncigar branes using the annulus amplitude, and find that they indeed match\nthe physical open string excitations of the c = 1 branes. The D0 brane\nin the topological theory has two physical open string states that match\nthe two perturbative physical degrees of freedom of the ZZ branes in the\nc = 1 string theory at self dual radius. The D2 brane in the coset has a\ncountably infinite set of chiral primary open string excitations (similar to the\nclosed string case). We compute the two point functions of these open chiral\nprimaries and find that they match the correlators of physical operators on\nthe FZZT branes in the c = 1 string theory.\nOrganization\nIn section 2, we review the supercoset theory and its twisting, in order to\nestablish conventions for the sequel. The A-twist of this model is equivalent\nto the c = 1 theory at self-dual radius. In section 3, we map the closed string\noperators by analyzing the null vectors in the Verma modules of SL(2, IR)\nand using the Wakimoto representation of SL(2, IR). We also identify, using\nspectral flow, the operators in the Hilbert space of the parent SL(2, IR)\ntheory which (after descent to the coset) map to the c = 1 states. In section\n4, we show that the one-point functions defining the localized and extended\nD-branes are equivalent in the two theories, and match the open string\nmarginal deformations of the branes as well as their reflection amplitudes. In\nappendix A, we collect a few useful facts about vertex operators on the cigar.\nIn appendix B, we exhibit an extended N = 2 algebra in the asymptotic\nvariables of the cigar.\n4\n\nNote that we will be considering always the Euclidean theory on the cigar and the\n\"D0-brane\" is really an instanton.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nThe twisted SL(2, IR)/U (1) coset\nThe N = 2 structure\n\nLet us first review the coset construction of Kazama-Suzuki [20] that leads\nto an N = 2 superconformal algebra. We follow the conventions in [18]\nwhich are natural from the point of view of the cigar geometry and perform\nthe axial gauging of the U (1) subgroup of the SL(2, IR). The N = 1 currents\nof the parent SL(2, IR)k theory has currents (J a , \u03c8 a ) that satisfy the OPE\ngab k/2\nfcab J c\n+\n(z \u2212 w)2\nz\u2212w\nab\nc\nif \u03c8\nJ a (z) \u03c8 b (w) \u223c c\nz\u2212w\ng ab\n.\n\u03c8 a (z) \u03c8 b (w) \u223c\nz\u2212w\nJ a (z) J b (w) \u223c\n\n(2.1)\n123\n\n= 1. In\nOur conventions are such that gab = diag(+, +, \u2212) and f 123 = f\norder to define the N = 2 currents, it is convenient to first define\ni a b\nj a = J a \u2212 J\u02c6a = J a + fbc\n\u03c8 \u03c8c .\n(2.2)\n2\na\na\nThe currents (j a , j ) commute with the free fermions (\u03c8 a , \u03c8 ) and generate\na bosonic SL(2, IR) at level k + 2. The Hilbert space of the original N = 1\nSL(2, IR)k model therefore factorizes into a purely bosonic SL(2, IR)k+2 and\n3 free fermions. We now implement the quotient of the action of (J 3 , \u03c8 3 )\nfollowing Kazama and Suzuki [20]. The N = 2 currents are given by:\nT = TSL(2,IR) \u2212 TU (1)\nr\n2 \u00b1 \u2213\n\u00b1\n\u03c8 j\nG =\nk\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2 3\n2 \u02c63\n2\nR\nJ = j + 1+\nJ = J 3 + \u03c8+ \u03c8\u2212\nk\nk\nk\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the U (1) energy momentum tensor is\n1\n1\nTU (1) = \u2212 J 3 J 3 + \u03c8 3 \u2202\u03c8 3 ,\nk\n2\n1\n\n2\n\n(2.4)\n1\n\n2\n\n\u00b1i\u03c8\n\u00b1ij\nand where we have used the formulae \u03c8 \u00b1 = \u03c8 \u221a\nand j \u00b1 = j \u221a\n. These\n2\n2\nconventions are chosen so that the superscript denotes the charge. Note that\nwe have conventions that are completely left-right symmetric and so we have\nnot specified the right movers explicitly. The currents in (2.3) generate an\nN = 2 superconformal algebra with central charge c = 3 + k6 .\n\n4\n\n\f2.2\n\nGauging\n\nTo clarify the geometry and construct the operator spectrum of the coset,\nit is useful to follow the procedure [8] of gauging the U (1) symmetry by the\naddition of a gauge field. The axial gauging of the coset is done by adding\nan extra boson X, and restricting to cohomology of an additional BRST\ncharge, whose currents are given by\nr\nk\n3\nJBRST = C (J + i\n\u2202X) + \u03b3 \u2032 (\u03c8 3 + \u03c8 X ) ,\n(2.5)\n2\nand similarly for the right-movers. Here, (B, C) is a (1, 0) ghost system\nassociated with this BRST symmetry with central charge c = \u22122. The\nfields X, X are the left and right moving components of the boson which\nwill be identified with the angular direction of the cigar geometry. The \u03b2 \u2032 , \u03b3 \u2032\nsuperghosts remove the contributions of the fermions \u03c8 3 and \u03c8 X leaving the\ntwo free free fermions on the cigar \u03c8 \u00b1 .

In the next section, we will interpret most of\n7\n\n\fthe operators as being descendants of operators in spectrally flowed sectors.\nBut in the present subsection, we allow the parameter that labels the Casimir\nof the discrete representations, j, to take all half-integer values. It is well\nknown that the observables of the topological A-model [7] are the chiral\nprimaries ((c, a) operators) in the NS-NS sector of the untwisted theory.\n\u2212\nThese states are annihilated by G+\n\u22121/2 and G\u22121/2 which implies the relation\n2\u2206 = Q and 2\u2206 = \u2212Q between the conformal dimension and R charge on\nthe left and right sector.\n3.1.1\n\nVerma modules of the SL(2, IR)3 Kac-Moody algebra\n\nWe shall restrict ourselves to the left-moving sector of the theory and we\nconsider states in theory that belong to the Wakimoto modules Wj . A most\nuseful result we will use is the following [11] :\n\u2022 For j \u2265 \u2212 12 , the Wakimoto modules Wj are isomorphic to the Verma\n+\nmodules Vj built on the lowest weight state (LWS) representation D\u2212j\n,\nwhile for j \u2264 \u2212 12 , the Wakimoto modules are isomorphic to the dual\n+ \u2217\nVerma modules Vj\u2217 built on the dual lowest weight space (D\u2212j\n) .\nA lowest weight state is a chiral primary state, as it is annihilated by j \u2212\n(and hence by G+ , from (2.3)) and has mbos = \u2212j. The Verma module built\non this state has null states which in turn are also lowest weight states. Each\nof these states will give rise to a chiral primary in the cigar and hence to\nan observable of the topological coset6 . We exhibit, in figure 1 and figure 2,\nthe location of null vectors in the Verma modules Vj for j \u2265 \u2212 12 and j \u2264 \u2212 12\nrespectively.\nThe location of the null states in the weight diagram of the Verma module\n+\n,\ncan be obtained from the Kac-Kazhdan determinant formula [19]. For D\u2212j\nthere is a null state for every pair of integers (r, s) which satisfy\n2j + 1 = r + s such that\n\nr * s > 0 or\n\nr > 0 and\n\ns = 0.\n\n(3.1)\n\nThe dimension and j 3 eigenvalue of the null vector relative to the original\nLWS are respectively given by \u2206h = r * s and \u2206mbos = r. Let us consider\nthe cases 2j + 1 \u2264 0. There are two exceptional cases :\n\u2022 For 2j + 1 = 0, we see from the Kac-Kazhdan formula that the Verma\nmodule is irreducible. The only primary is the original LWS state with\nj = \u2212mbos = \u2212 12 .\n6\n\nFor a general proof of this statement, see [6].\n\n8\n\n\fL0\n\n1 0\n0\n1 10\n1 0\n1\n\nj3\n0\n\nFigure 1: The weight diagram for a Verma module built on a lowest weight\n+\nof SL(2, IR) with Casimir parametrized by j \u2265 \u2212 12 , with\nrepresentation D\u2212j\nprimary marked by the big full dot, and null vectors marked by open white\ncircles. (The small black dots on the horizontal axis are calibrations.)\n\u2022 For 2j + 1 = \u22121, or j = \u22121, there are again no null states among the\ndescendants and the module is irreducible.\nFor 2j + 1 \u2264 \u22122, we always have a null vector with s = \u22121 and r = 2j + 2.\nThe Verma module built on this null vector is reducible and its null vectors\ncoincide with all other null vectors present in the original LWS module. On\nthe other hand, for a Verma module with 2j + 1 > 0, there is a null vector\nwith s = 0 and r = 2j + 1 and again, the Verma module built upon this null\nvector includes all other null vectors. Using these two facts, we find that\nthe original LWS module is reducible and can be resolved into a string of\nirreducible modules [24, 1]. For j \u2265 \u2212 21 , we find (for integer j)\nIj \u2212\u2192 I\u2212j\u22121 \u2212\u2192 Ij\u22121 \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 I0 \u2212\u2192 I\u22121\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere Ij refers to the irreducible representation built on a LWS with mbos =\n\u2212j. Similarly for j \u2264 \u22121, we get (for integer j)\nIj \u2190\u2212 I\u2212j\u22122 \u2190\u2212 Ij+1 \u2190\u2212 . . . \u2190\u2212 I0 \u2190\u2212 I\u22121\n\n(3.3)\n\nWe summarize these results by labeling the j03 spectrum of lowest weight\n+\n+\n= {\u2212|j| + 2, . . . , |j|} for\nstates as S>\n= {\u2212j, . . . , j + 1} for j \u2265 \u2212 12 and S<\nj \u2264 \u22121.\n9\n\n\fL0\n\nj3\n\n1111\n00\n0011\n0011\n00\n\n0\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: The weight diagram for a Verma module built on a lowest weight\n+\nrepresentation D\u2212j\nwith Casimir j \u2264 \u2212 12 , with primary marked by the big\nfull dot, and null vectors marked by open white circles.\n3.1.2\n\nCohomology of Q\n\nFor every such null vector, we will find a state in the c = 1 BRST cohomology\nas follows : from each of the lowest weight primary states, we first construct\nrepresentatives of the BRST cohomology of the topological cigar theory. In\norder to do that, we consider the BRST operator:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\nZ \u0014\ni\n\u2212\n3\nQ = Qtop + QU (1) =\ncj + C j + cb + \u221a \u2202X\n.\n(3.4)\n2\nIn the cohomology relative to the zero-mode of C, we consider only states\nannihilated by\nZ\nZ\ni\n3\n(3.5)\nj0 + \u221a \u2202X + cb ,\n2\nwhich leads to the equation for states in the relative cohomology :\n\u2212pX = m = (mbos + ngh ) .\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhere ngh is the ghost number.\nNow, we can construct states in the BRST cohomology of the topological\ncigar theory by considering the following states in the Wakimoto modules\nWj (see [34] for conventions for ghost sector):\n| \u2193i \u2297 |LW Si\n10\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fcombined with the state with the appropriate X-momentum fixed by (3.6).\nThese states are at ghost number \u22121/2. The corresponding operator, by\nthe state-operator correspondence [34] is at ghost number one. Thus, we\nfind operators corresponding to states in the BRST cohomology which are\nat ghost number one. These operators, given the spectra for mbos found\nabove for the highest weight states, and the link between the m-quantum\nnumber, mbos and the ghost charge of the state (3.6), have a spectrum\n+\n+\nof m-values which is S>\n= {\u2212j \u2212 1/2, . . . , j + 1/2} and S<\n= {\u2212|j| +\n3/2, \u2212|j| + 1/2, . . . , |j| \u2212 1/2}. Notice that the latter spectrum can be split\n+\nas S<\n= {|j| \u2212 1/2} \u222a {\u2212|j| + 3/2, . . . , |j| \u2212 3/2}. This will prove useful in\nidentifying the c = 1 states to which these chiral primaries are mapped.\nWe first consider the case j \u2265 \u2212 12 . Defining s = j + 12 , the range\n+\nof X-momentum in S>\nfills out a spin-s SU (2)-representation. It will be\nconvenient to provide free field (Wakimoto) representations of certain cohomology elements at this point. We choose the sign of \u03c6-momentum to be\nopposite to the sign of j (modulo a constant shift). Demanding that the\nSU (2)-highest weight state with (pX = j + 12 ) has dimension zero in the\ntwisted theory, we find\nVj = c e\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c6\n\n\u221a\n\ne\n\n2(j+ 12 )(\u2212\u03c6+iX)\n\n= ce\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n2(s+1)\u03c6 i 2sX\n\ne\n\n\u2212\n\u2261 Ys,s\n.\n\n(3.8)\n\nIn the last equality, we have identified the vertex operator with the tachyonic\n\u2212 in [43]. The rest of the null vectors\nstate at ghost number one denoted Ys,s\n+\n\u2212\nin S>\nare obtained by acting alternately with j0+ and j\u22121\nin the SL(2, IR)\nrepresentation. This leads to operators with the same \u03c6-momentum but\nwith X-momentum decreased by one. This operation is equivalent to acting\nwith the coset analog of the SU (2) lowering operator K \u2212 (introduced in [1])\non the operator in formula (3.8)\nI\n\u221a\n\u2212\nK =\n\u03b2 e\u2212i 2X .\n(3.9)\nIn this way we can show that the elements in the topological coset cohomology which arise from all the lowest weight states in the Verma module\n\u2212 of the c = 1 bosonic string\nwith j \u2265 \u2212 12 correspond to the elements Ys,n\ncohomology (row one of Table 3).\n+\nWe turn to the case j \u2264 \u22121, the elements in S<\n, which has the opposite\nsign for the Liouville momentum. Again, the lowest weight states gives\nrise to elements in the cohomology of ghost number 1. The state with\nm = \u2212pX = |j| \u2212 12 can once again be given a Wakimoto representation.\nDefining s = \u2212(j + 21 ), we get the state with the lowest X-momentum in\n11\n\n\fthe SU (2) s-multiplet :\n\u221a\n\n+\n= ce\nYs,\u2212s\n\n\u221a\n2(s\u22121)\u03c6 \u2212i 2sX\n\ne\n\n.\n\n(3.10)\n\nThe operator corresponding to the next null vector in the weight diagram is\n\u2212 2|j|\u22121\nfound by acting with (j\u22121\n)\n.

We see that we have recovered the\nring structure obtained in [43] thereby confirming our identification. Note\nthat using our definition of a in the coset, O0,0 = 1 as expected. We also\n+\n. Once the top element Os\u22121,s\u22121 has\nobserve that a = B\u22123/2 and a \u2208 D3/2\nbeen obtained, the lowering operator K \u2212 can be used to construct all the\nghost number zero operators Os\u22121,n and their partners aOs\u22121,n . Formally,\nthe operation of removing a from an operator is defined by acting with the\noperator G\u2212\n\u22121/2 .\nTo summarize, we see that the elements in the topological coset cohomol+\nogy which arise from all the lowest weight states in the Verma module of D\u2212j\n+\n, aOs\u22121,n } of\nwith j \u2264 \u22121 correspond to the ghost number 1 elements {Ys,\u2212s\n12\n\n\fthe c = 1 bosonic string cohomology (row three of Table 3).

This generates partner states at ghost numbers\none greater or one less than the state one started off with. The inverse aoperation is carried out by using the operator G\u2212\n1/2 in the coset theory. In\nthe twisted theory and in the Wakimoto variables, this coincides with the\noperation \u03b2b0 (in agreement with [44]). We summarize our results in Table\n3 and mention that these operators are in one to one correspondence with\nthe rather abstract list of cohomology elements at ghost number 0,1 and 2,\nin the Appendix of [1] by E.

We first make a few observations about spectral\nflow:\n\u2022 Consider a state in the coset |s1i with\n2\n|s1i : Lcig\n0 = \u2212j(j + 1) + m\n\nJ03 = m J\u02c603 = 0\n\nJ0R = 2m .\n\n(3.15)\n\nThis descends from a state in the parent theory with\nL0 = \u2212j(j + 1)\n\nJ03 = m J\u02c603 = 0 .\n\n(3.16)\n\nA spectral flow by w units takes this state to another state with\nL0 = \u2212j(j + 1) +\n\nmw w2\n\u2212\n2\n4\n\nJ03 = m +\n\nw\n2\n\nJ\u02c603 = \u2212w .\n\n(3.17)\n\nThis state descends in the cigar to |s2i with\nw \u02c63\n2\nJ0 = \u2212w J0R = 2m . (3.18)\n|s2i : Lcig\nJ03 = m +\n0 = \u2212j(j + 1) + m\n2\nIn particular, the dimension and R-charge of the state in the coset does not\nchange. The fermion number ( = ghost number in the c = 1 theory) changes\nby w units.\n\u2022 The operator G\u2212\n1/2 in the untwisted theory changes the dimension and\n\nR-charge of a state by (\u2212 12 , \u22121), and therefore acts on the Qtop cohomology.\nThis operator also decreases the fermion number by 1 unit. Recall that this\nis identical to the inverse-a operation mentioned in subsection 3.1.2.\n\nFollowing the construction in section 3.1, we now give an algorithm that\nallows us to obtain all physical states of the c = 1 theory starting with the\noperator \u03a6\u2212 1 , 1 and doing the operations of spectral flow, finding descen2 2\n\n\u2212\ndants using the operators j0+ and j\u22121\nand the \"inverse-a\" operation (acting\n\u2212\nwith G1/2 ). All these are operations strictly within the untwisted coset theory. The resulting states in the twisted theory will be BRST cohomology\nelements.\n\n\u2022 Start with the operator \u03a6\u2212 1 , 1 which has dimension and R-charge given\n2 2\n\nR\nby 2Lcig\n0 = J = 1 in the untwisted theory. From Table 3, we see that in\nthe topological theory, this maps to the state\n+\n\u2212\n= Y0,0\n= c e\u2212\n\u03a6\u2212 1 , 1 = Y0,0\n2 2\n\n14\n\n\u221a\n\n2\u03c6\n\n.\n\n(3.19)\n\n\fWe will obtain other states in the c = 1 theory by repeatedly applying a\ntwo-step procedure : (a) spectral flow by one unit, (b) act by G\u2212\n1/2 . The\noperator that implements the spectral flow can be explicitly written out in\nWakimoto variables as7\nU = c \u03b2 \u22121 e\n\n\u221ai X\n2\n\n\u2212 \u221a\u03c6\n\ne\n\n.\n\n(3.20)\n\n= aY 1\u2212, 1 ,\n\n(3.21)\n\n2\n\n\u00b1\nActing with U on Y0,0\nresults in\n\u2212 \u221a3 \u03c6\n\nc \u2202c \u03b2 \u22121 e\n\n2\n\ne\n\n\u221ai X\n2\n\n2 2\n\nwhere the explicit representatives are given in [1]. From Table 3, this oper\u2212\n+\n\u2212\nto a state aY 1\u2212, 1 \u2208 D\u22121\nation (in coset variables) takes a state Y0,0\n\u2208 D1/2\n2 2\n\nand amounts to exchanging the two limits of the improved bound \u22121/2 \u2265\nj \u2265 \u22121. This confirms that U indeed implements spectral flow. Acting on\n\u2212\nthis state with G\u2212\n1/2 removes the factor of a and we thus get Y 1 , 1 . The\n2 2\n\nR\ncorresponding operator in the untwisted theory has 2Lcig\n0 = J = 0.\n\nMore generally, if we start with a state at ghost number one with 2Lcig\n0 =\nR\nJ = \u2212j, what we have shown is that spectral flow by one unit w = \u22121\n\u2212\nR\npreserves the 2Lcig\n0 = J as shown above. Then act by G1/2 to get a state at\nR\nghost number one with 2Lcig\n0 = J = \u2212j \u2212 1. In this way, one can generate\n\u2212 . Once we have generated the chiral states with\nall the states of the form Ys,s\narbitrary low dimension, we can use the construction of subsection 3.1.2 and\n\u2212 \u2013 acting with j + , j \u2212 .\nget the rest of aYs,n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u2022 Let us now spectral flow in the opposite direction (using U \u22121 ) starting\n\u00b1\n, but now reversing the steps : (a) multiply by\nwith the same operator Y0,0\n\u22121\na, (b) act with U . We get\n\u2212 \u221ai X \u2212 \u221a1 \u03c6\n\nce\n\n2\n\ne\n\n2\n\n= Y 1+,\u2212 1 .\n2\n\n(3.22)\n\n2\n\nwhere we have again taken explicit representatives from [1]. Repeating this\n+\n(and their ghost\ntwo step procedure we generate all states of the form Ys,\u2212s\nnumber two partners). As before, we can use the construction of 3.1.2\n+ by acting with j + , j \u2212 . We have thus completely\nand get the rest of Ys,n\n0\n\u22121\ngenerated the states in the 2nd and 4th rows of Table 3 as follows :\na\n\n... \u2190\n\u2212\n7\n\nY 1+,\u2212 1\n2\n2\n\nU \u22121\n\n\u2190\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\n+ a\n\u2190\n\u2212\naY0,0\n\n\u00b1 U\n\u2212\n\u2192\nY0,0\n\nThis operator was introduced in [1].\n\n15\n\naY 1\u2212, 1\n2 2\n\nG\u2212\n1/2\n\nU\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Y 1\u2212, 1 \u2212\n\u2192 ...\n2 2\n\n(3.23)\n\n\f+\n\u2212 also appear\nand Ys,s\n\u2022 But now, note from Table 3 that the elements Ys,\u2212s\nin the 3rd and 1st rows respectively. Thus, the descent operations on these\nparticular states (i.e. finding null vectors in the Verma modules) will give\nus all the discrete states at ghost number 1, as well as their partners at\nghost number two/zero obtained by multiplying/inverting a. Thus, we can\nreconstruct all the elements in Table 3.\n\n+\n\nTo summarize, what we have shown is that given the operator \u03a6\u2212 1 , 1 \u2208\n2 2\n\nD 1 along with the states one can obtain from it by spectral flow, and using\n2\n\n\u2212\noperations intrinsic to the coset theory (such as acting with G\u2212\n1/2 , j0 and\n+\nj\u22121\n), one can generate all physical operators in the c = 1 theory. We would\nlike to point out that most of these chiral operators in the coset have J0R 6= 1.\nThe only operators which do are the chiral primary N=2 Liouville interaction\noperators, which map to the Liouville interaction in the c = 1 theory.\n\n3.3\n\nRelative normalization\n\nSo far, the analysis of section 3.1.2 has enabled us to identify the quantum\nnumbers of the operators on the coset side that maps to the tachyonic operators Vj in the c = 1 string and in equation (3.8), we have an explicit\nrealization in terms of Wakimoto variables. However, in the next sections\nwhere we compare disc one point functions that define D-branes in the two\ntheories, the relative normalization of the closed string fields becomes relevant.\nIn this section, we fix the precise relative normalization between the cigar\nchiral primaries and the c = 1 tachyonic operators Vj by using the reflection\namplitudes for closed strings in the two backgrounds. In particular, we will\nconsider certain winding operators on the c = 1 string side that will couple to\nNeumann branes (in the c = 1 direction). We recall that there are operators\nin the c = 1 theory which are the reflections of (3.8) off the Liouville wall:\n\u1e7cj = c c e\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n2(j+ 23 )\u03c6 \u2212i 2(j+ 21 )(X\u2212X)\n\ne\n\n.\n\n(3.24)\n\nThese operators8 have the opposite X momentum as Vj , and the same exponent of \u03c6. They are related to the operators (3.8) as [10] (with \u03b3(x) =\nIn [1], these were obtained by acting on Vj with j0+ 2j + 1 times. This leads to powers\n\u221a\nof \u03b2 which can be put to a constant consistently since j + = \u03bc is a spin 0 operator.\n8\n\n16\n\n\f\u0393(x)\n\u0393(1\u2212x) ):\n\nVj = S(j) \u1e7c\u2212j\u22121\n\u22122j\u22121\n\nS(j) = \u2212(\u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(1))\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0393(2j + 2)\n\u0393(\u22122j)\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(3.25)\n\nFrom the cigar theory, we can simply understand them as reflections off the\ntip. Operators in the coset with j \u2265 \u2212 12 and j \u2264 \u2212 21 are also related by a\nreflection amplitude [33, 37] (we are restricting to specific (c, a) fields):\n\u03a6j,\u2212j,j = R(j, \u2212j, j) \u03a6\u2212j\u22121,\u2212j,j .\n\n(3.26)\n\nwith\n\u0393(\u2212j + m)\u0393(\u2212j \u2212 m)(\u0393(2j + 1))2\nR(j, \u2212j, j) = \u2212(\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1))\u22121\u22122j\n\u0393(1 + j + m)\u0393(1 + j \u2212 m)(\u0393(\u22122j \u2212 1))2\n\"\n\u00132 #\n\u0012\n\u0393(2\n+\n2j)\nm=\u2212j\n* (\u0393(\u22122j))2 .\n\u2212\u2192 \u2212(\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1))\u22121\u22122j\n\u0393(\u22122j)\n\n(3.27)\n\nSince the observables Vj in the c = 1 string are mapped to \u03a6j,\u2212j of the\ncoset, we see from (3.26) that \u1e7cj maps to the operators \u03a6j,j+1 in the coset.\nWe shall use these amplitudes to fix the relative normalization between the\ncoset and c = 1 string operators. We may write\n\u03a6j,\u2212j,j = N 2 S(j) \u03a6\u2212j\u22121,\u2212j,j\n\nwith\n\nN = \u0393(\u22122j) ,\n\n(3.28)\n\n1\n\u1e7c\u2212j\u22121 .\n\u0393(\u22122j)\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhich tells us that\n\u03a6j,\u2212j,j 7\u2192 \u0393(\u22122j) Vj\n\nand\n\n\u03a6\u2212j\u22121,\u2212j,j 7\u2192\n\nWe will see later that these relative normalizations are indeed the natural\nones when we compare the disc one-point functions of the respective branes\nin the two theories.\n\n3.4\n\nSome connections to the conifold geometry\n\nIn this section, we briefly discuss a few target space geometrical aspects\nof the bulk theory. We note that this subsection is technically somewhat\northogonal to the rest of the paper. We discuss some features of the well\n\n17\n\n\fknown claim [13] that the c = 1 string theory is equivalent to the topological\nB-model on the deformed conifold defined as a hypersurface inC4 :\n\u0012\n\u0013\na1 a4\ndet\n= a1 a2 \u2212 a3 a4 = \u03bc .\n(3.30)\na3 a2\nTo support the claim, we review in some detail the construction of the analog\nof the holomorphic three-form in the c = 1 bosonic string language. The\nholomorphic three-form can locally be written as:\n\u03a9=\n\nda1 da2 da3\n.\na3\n\n(3.31)\n\nWe can translate the holomorphic three-form in terms of the operators\nthat generate the ground ring using the relations a1 = xx\u2032 , a2 = yy \u2032 , a3 =\nxy \u2032 , a4 = yx\u2032 , where\ny = O 1 ,\u2212 1\n\nx = O1,1\n2 2\n\n\u2032\n\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nx = O 1,1\n\n2\n\ny = O 1 ,\u2212 1 .\n\n2 2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(3.32)\n\nThe resulting expression for the holomorphic threeform can be compactly\nwritten as:\n\u03a9 = \u03c9 \u2227 \u03b8\u2032 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2227 \u03c9\u2032\n(3.33)\nwhere we have made use of the following definitions for the volume form \u03c9\nand the one-form \u03b8 on the (x, y)-plane:\n\u03b8 = xdy \u2212 ydx\n\nand\n\n\u03c9 = d\u03b8 = dx \u2227 dy,\n\n(3.34)\n\nand similarly for the right-movers. Using the duality between forms and\nvector fields [44], one can dualize the three-form to the vector field S:\nS = x\u2202x + y\u2202y \u2212 x\u2032 \u2202x\u2032 \u2212 y \u2032 \u2202y\u2032 .\n\n(3.35)\n\nIn [44], there is a precise dictionary between physical vertex operators in the\nc = 1 string and vector fields and differential forms on the conifold. From the\nabove reasoning, the vertex operator that corresponds to the holomorphic\n3-form can now be read off to be\n\u03a9 7\u2192 a + a,\n\n(3.36)\n\nwhere a is the ghost number one operator introduced in (3.12). The vector\nfield S in (3.35) measures the difference between left and right-moving Liouville momentum in the c = 1 bosonic string theory. All functions on the\n18\n\n\fquadric defined by (3.30) must be S-invariant. Indeed this is equivalent to\nthe statement that all operators in the c = 1 theory have equal left-right\nLiouville momentum [44].\nThere are an infinite number of left and right moving currents on the\nworldsheet Js,n,n\u2032 which are generated from the elements of the cohomology\nusing a descent procedure described in [44]. The currents that generate the\nleft and right SU (2) action are those with s = 1. These are symmetries of\nthe c = 1 string and so symmetries of the B-model on the deformed conifold.\nIn the geometric description, these symmetries are therefore generated by\nvector fields whose Lie derivative action on the holomorphic 3-form vanishes\nL * \u03a9 = 0. The explicit expressions for these vector fields can be obtained\nfrom the discussion in the appendix of [43]. The s = 1 currents are given\nby9\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ a4\nY = \u2212a4\n\u2212 a2\n\u2202a4\n\u2202a2\n\u2202a1\n\u2202a3\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ a2\n\u2212 a1\n\u2212 a3\nZ = a4\n\u2202a4\n\u2202a2\n\u2202a1\n\u2202a3\n\nX = a1\n\n(3.37)\n\nThey satisfy the algebra\n[X, Y ] = Z\n\n[Z, X] = \u2212X\n\nand\n\n[Z, Y ] = Y .\n\n(3.38)\n\nThese vector fields generate the left SU (2) currents and one can check that\nthe Lie derivative of each of these vector fields leaves \u03a9 in (3.33) invariant.\nThe simplest way to do this is to define\n\u039b = df \u2227 \u03a9 = da1 da2 da3 da4 ,\n\n(3.39)\n\nand show that LX \u039b = LX df = 0 and similarly for Y and Z. That concludes\nour review of some features and symmetries of the conifold geometry and\nits connection to the c = 1 string language. We move on from the closed\nstring to the open string sector in the next section.\n\n4\n\nD-branes and open strings\n\nIn this section, we shall present the boundary states for the B-branes in the\ntopological theory on the cigar by starting with the known BPS boundary\nstate on the physical cigar theory, and restricting to the chiral primaries. We\n9\n\nThese coincide with the expressions in equation (2.24) of [43] when expressed in the\n(x, y, x\u2032 y \u2032 ) variables.\n\n19\n\n\fshall show that the one-point functions of these operators precisely match\nthe one-point functions of the c = 1 closed string operators (described in\nthe previous section) on the branes when the matter part of the brane is\nat the point corresponding to Neumann boundary conditions. Further, by\nanalyzing the vacuum annulus diagram and disk diagrams in the topological\ntheory, we show that the open string spectrum and boundary two point\nfunctions are the same.\n\n4.1\n\nThe branes of the c = 1 theory\n\nIn the c = 1 theory, the D-branes are described by a boundary state in the\nCFT describing the free boson at self-dual radius tensored with a boundary\nstate in the Liouville theory at c = 25 with one BRST condition imposed.\nIn the c = 1 matter sector, the boundary states are those of SU (2)1\nwhich span [36] the three-dimensional SU (2) group manifold. The boundary\ncondition breaks the SU (2)L \u00d7 SU (2)R of the closed strings to the diagonal\nSU (2)+ under which the open string states are classified.\nAs described in the introduction, the Liouville theory admits two types\nof boundary conditions. one corresponding to branes localized in the strong\ncoupling region and the other extended in the Liouville direction to the\nweak coupling region. The localized ZZ branes do not have any further\nparameters, whereas the extended FZZT branes have an additional modulus\ngiven by the complex parameter \u03c3 which is related to the position in the\nLiouville direction where the brane dissolves.\nIn the open string sector, the ZZ branes admit only the identity representation, so the only allowed marginal operators are the three Goldstone\nbosons corresponding to the broken\ngenerators. At the north pole on the\n\u221a\n3-sphere10 , these are (ic\u2202X, ce\u00b1i 2X ). The operator c\u2202X however is null in\nthis theory, as can be seen from the negative sign in the partition function\nof the ZZ brane in the c = 1 theory11 . When X has the interpretation of\ntime, this operator is the gauge field A0 which does not have a kinetic term.\nThere can be however physical Wilson lines of this gauge field when X is a\nEuclidean compact direction (as we consider).\nThe FZZT branes on the other hand admit in the open string sector all\nthe continuous and discrete representations. The physical operators at ghost\nnumber one [12] are labeled as Vnl where (l, n) are the quantum numbers of\n10\n\nIn the circle description,\nthis point corresponds to Neumann boundary conditions.\n\u221a\nThe operators e\u00b1i 2X become marginal only at the self dual radius.\n11\nThis can be seen by tensoring the ZZ partition function [45] with the annulus amplitude of the c = 1 Neumann brane [36]\n\n20\n\n\fthe conserved SU (2), 2l \u2208 Z, \u2212l \u2264 n \u2264 l. The (l, l) operators are explicitly\ngiven by12\n\u221a\n\u221a\nVlbdry = ce 2(2l+1)(iX\u2212\u03c6)\u2212 2\u03c6 .\n(4.1)\nThe 3 modes of dimension 1 on the FZZT branes correspond to the three\nGoldstone modes of the broken generators. Turning on these modes changes\nthe value of the zero mode corresponding to the broken symmetry.\n\n4.2\n4.2.1\n\nD0/ZZ branes\nBoundary state\n\nThe (1, 1) ZZ brane in the c = 1 string theory is a tensor product of two\nboundary states: the (1, 1) ZZ brane in Liouville theory and the Neumann\nbrane in the matter sector. The one point function of a closed string operator\ntherefore factorizes as\nhVj i = he\u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n2(j+ 32 )\u03c6\n\ni * hei\n\n\u221a\n\n2(j+ 21 )(X\u2212X)\n\ni.\n\n(4.2)\n\nThe disc one-point functions for the ZZ branes are normalized so that h1i =\n1. This is useful as all momentum independent factors drop out of the\nexpressions for the one-point function. The non-trivial piece of the one\npoint function arises from the Liouville part of the operator (3.8) and can\nbe read off from [45] to be (with b = 1 and Q = 2 in their conventions)\n3\n\nhVj i = 2 * (\u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(1))\u2212j\u2212 2 *\n\n1\n.\n\u0393(\u22122j \u2212 1)\u0393(\u22122j)\n\n(4.3)\n\nIn the coset theory, the properly normalized one-point function is [9, 37,\n18, 2, 17]:\n\u0393(\u22122j)\u0393(0)\n\u03a8D0 (j ; \u2212j, \u2212j)\n\u0393(1)\u0393(3)\n\u2212 12 \u2212j\n* (\u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(1))\u22121\n3 3 3 = (\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1))\nD0\n\u0393(\u22122j \u2212 1)\u0393(\u22122j)\n\u0393(3)\u0393(0)\n\u03a8 (\u2212 2 ; 2 , 2 )\n\u0014\n\u0015\n3\n1\n\u0393(\u22122j)\n=\n* 2 (\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1))\u2212j\u2212 2\n\u0393(3)\n\u0393(\u22122j \u2212 1)\u0393(\u22122j)\n(4.4)\nTaking into account the normalization factor (3.29) for the two vertex operators with j = j and j = \u2212 32 , we see that there is exact match with the\nc = 1 one point function.\n12\nIn contrast to the closed strings, the even dimensional representations of SU (2) are\nnot allowed. we have kept the convention \u03b1\u2032open = \u03b1\u2032closed in writing the above vertex\noperators on the branes. This introduces a factor of two in the vertex operators (4.1) as\na function of l compared to the closed strings.\n\n21\n\n\f4.2.2\n\nOpen string spectrum\n\nThe open string spectrum on the topological branes can be deduced from the\nannulus amplitude by restricting to the open string chiral primaries. The\nlocalized branes have only the identity representation in the open string\nchannel e.g. [18], and the NS sector open string partition function (k = 1)\nis given by\nNS\nZ1,1\n(\u03c4, \u03bd) =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010 2\n\u03983 (\u03c4, \u03bd) X\n1\ns \u2212s 2s\u22121\ns2 +s 2s+1\nq\ny\n\u2212\nq\ny\n\u03b7(\u03c4 )3\n1 + yq s\n1\ns\u2208ZZ+ 2\n\n=\n\n\u0011\n\u03983 (\u03c4, \u03bd) X \u0010 s2 \u2212s 2s\u22121\ns\nq\ny\n(1\n\u2212\nyq\n)\n.\n\u03b7(\u03c4 )3\n1\n\n(4.5)\n\ns\u2208ZZ+ 2\n\nThe total number of chiral primaries in the open channel can be obtained\nsimply by writing out the Ramond sector partition function and counting\nthe number of Ramond ground states. This can be easily done in our case.\nThe result is\nR\nZ1,1\n(\u03c4, 0) = 2 + 4q + 12q 2 + . . .\n(4.6)\nThus, we infer that there are two chiral primary states. The dimension and\nR-charge of these states can be found by now expanding (4.5) as\nc\n\nNS\nTrNS q L0 y J0 = q 24 Z1,1\n(\u03c4, \u03bd)\n3\n\n= 1 + q + (y \u22123 + y \u22121 + y + y 3 )q 2 + (y \u22122 + 3 + y 2 )q 2 + . . .\n(4.7)\nIt is easy to see that the two chiral primary states have dimension and R0)\ncharge (\u2206, QR ) given by (0, 0) and ( 32 , 3). The first state with (j = m =\n\u221a\n2X\n13\n\u00b1i\nand its reflected operator match the two physical open string states e\non the ZZ branes in the c = 1 theory discussed earlier. Note that this is\nsimply the chiral part of the closed string map (3.8), (3.24), after being\ncareful about normalizations. We make a few remarks about the spectrum :\n\u2022 The (j = \u2212m = 0) state maps to the spin 21 representation in the closed\nstring theory (3.8), (3.24). In the open string theory, it maps to operators\nin the spin 1 representation. The reason is the same as to why only odd\ndimensional reps are allowed on the FZZT branes in this theory [12], and\n13\n\nAs in the closed string case, operators with j + j \u2032 = \u22121 are reflected into each other,\nand the topological theory will only count (e.g. from the Ramond sector ground states\n(4.6)) one for each such pair of operators.\n\n22\n\n\fboils down to the fact that the conformal dimension (R charge) of a closed\nstring operator is the sum of the left and right dimensions (R charge). Operationally, this is the factor of two in (4.1).\n\u2022 The other state with (\u2212j = m = 32 ) and its reflected counterpart corresponds to the ghost number zero states Bj , B\u0303j described in (3.11) and\ndiscussed in [1, 40].\n\u2022 The operator corresponding to the state c\u2202X is not present in the spectrum, as on the ZZ branes of the c = 1 theory. There is however one other\nmode which is not a physical perturbative open string state which enters\nthe definition of the B-brane boundary state as the zero mode of the scalar\ncorresponding to the R-current. This corresponds to the Wilson line on the\nZZ brane.\n\u2022 The two open string \"moduli\" above are not dimension one operators on\nthe physical branes in the superstring theory involving this coset, such a\nbrane would have no moduli (e.g. the localized branes constructed in [4, 5]).\n\n4.3\n\nD2/FZZT branes\n\nLet us introduce a bit of notation to facilitate the matching of boundary\nstates between the extended D2 branes of the coset and the FZZT branes\nin c = 1 string theory. The FZZT branes are semiclassically defined by a\nboundary interaction of the form [10]\nZ\ne\u03c6 dx ,\n(4.8)\nSbdry = \u03bcB\n\u2202\u03a3\n\nwhere x is a coordinate along the boundary. The one point functions are\nsolutions to certain recursion relations which are obtained by looking at\na bulk two point function involving specific (bulk) degenerate fields. The\nresult for the one point functions are written in terms of a uniformization\n\u03bc2\nparameter s related to \u03bcB as cosh2 (\u03c0bs) = \u03bcB sin \u03c0b2 where we have to\ntake the limit b \u2192 1. Here \u03bc is the bulk cosmological constant. We shall\nexplicitly write them out in the following section. For now, we focus on a\nsimilar discussion of extended branes in the coset CFT following [17].\nThe discussion in [17] is in the context of N = 2 liouville theory with\nboundary, which is just the mirror theory to the one we have been considering. In particular, there is a precise map between the extended A-branes\nin that theory and the extended B-branes we consider. These can again be\n\n23\n\n\fdescribed in terms of a boundary interaction term\nZ\n\u221a\ndx(\u03bb\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u03bb)(\u03c8 + \u03c8 \u2212 \u2212 i 2\u2202\u03b8)e\u2212Q\u03c6\nSbdy = \u2212\u03bc\u0303B\n\n(4.9)\n\nThe common link between the two boundary interactions is that these are\n\"holomorphic square roots\" of bulk screening operators [17]. The \u03bb are\nboundary fermions that introduce Chan-Paton factors on the boundary. The\none point functions are again computed using techniques similar to the Liouville case and are specified by a complex parameter \u03c3 which is related to\n1\n1\n\u03bc\u0303B above as \u03bc\u0303B = 2\u03c0k\n(\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1)) 2 \u0393(\u2212 k1 ) cos( \u03c0k \u03c3).\n4.3.1\n\nBoundary state\n\nLet us compare the one point functions of FZZT branes and the extended\nD2 branes of the supersymmetric coset theory. The non-trivial piece arises\nfrom the Liouville factor, and can be read off from [10] to be (putting b = 1)\n1\n\nhVj i = (\u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(1))\u2212j\u2212 2 \u0393(2j + 1)\u0393(2j + 2) cosh(\u03c0s(2j + 1)) .\n\n(4.10)\n\nNote that this is the unnormalized one point function and we have only kept\nthe j-dependent pieces. The relevant wavefunction in the coset theory can\nbe obtained from [18, 37] to be\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u0393(0)\n\u03a8D2 (j ; \u2212j, \u2212j) = (\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1))\u2212j\u2212 2 \u0393(\u22122j)ei\u03c3(2j+1) +\ne\u2212i\u03c3(2j+1) \u00d7\n\u0393(2j + 1)\n\u00d7 \u0393(2j + 1) \u0393(2j + 2) .\n1\n\n= \u0393(\u22122j) * 2 (\u03bc\u0303\u03b3(1))\u2212j\u2212 2 \u0393(2j + 1) \u0393(2j + 2) cos(\u03c0\u03c3(2j + 1)) .\n(4.11)\n\nThus, taking into account the normalization (3.29), we see that the unnormalized one point functions once again match if we identify the FZZT\nparameter (s) with the semi-classical B-field on the D2 brane (\u03c3) as is = \u03c3.\n4.3.2\n\nOpen string spectrum and two point function\n\nThe open string spectrum is deduced from the annulus amplitude [18] as\nbefore. The open string spectrum on extended D2-branes on the cigar is\nindependent of \u03bcB and the boundary state allows all the continuous and\ndiscrete representations in the open string channel. The analysis of the\nspectrum therefore reduces to that of the (chiral part of) the closed string\n24\n\n\fspectrum as in section 3. Restricting attention to the chiral primaries, we\nfind that the topological open string operators labeled by an half-integer l\ncan be mapped to the marginal operators Vlbdry of the FZZT branes.\nNote that in this case, like the closed strings, but in contrast to the\nlocalized branes, the three operators corresponding to motion along the\nbroken SU (2) directions are all physical.\nThe boundary operators have a boundary fermion number, and each\nbrane thus has a two dimensional Chan-Paton index. The open string operators have even or odd boundary fermion numbers at each end and are thus\ntwo by two matrices. This fermion number maps to the ghost number as\nfor the closed strings, and while comparing boundary two point functions,\nwe restrict ourselves to physical operators at fermion number 1.\nThe boundary open string reflection amplitude on the FZZT branes is:\nj+ 1\n\n2\nd(l|s1 , s2 ) = \u03bdF ZZ\n\nG(\u22122l \u2212 1)\n\u00d7\nG(2l + 1)\n1\n\nS(l +\n\n3\n2\n\n+\n\n2\ni s1 +s\n2 )S(l\n\n+\n\n3\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n2\ni s1 \u2212s\n2 )S(l\n\n+\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n+ i s1 \u2212s\n2 )S(l +\n\n3\n2\n\n2\n\u2212 i s1 \u2212s\n2 )\n(4.12)\n\nwhere \u03bdF ZZ = \u03c0\u03bc\u03b3(b = 1). The boundary two point function for chiral\noperators with fermion number one (l + m = 0) on the D2-brane on the\ncigar is [17]:\n\u0393(\u2212l + m) l+ 1 G(\u22122l \u2212 1)\n\u03bd 2\n\u00d7\n\u0393(l + m + 1)\nG(2l + 1)\n1\n5\n3\nS(l + J1 + J2 + 2 )S(l + J1 \u2212 J2 + 2 )S(l \u2212 J1 + J2 + 23 )S(l \u2212 J1 \u2212 J2 + 12 )\n1 G(\u22122l \u2212 1)\n\u00d7\n= \u0393(\u22122l) * \u03bd j+ 2\nG(2l + 1)\n1\ns1 +s2\ns1 \u2212s2\ns1 +s2\n3\n3\n3\n2\nS(l + 2 + i 2 )S(l + 2 + i 2 )S(l + 32 \u2212 i s1 \u2212s\n2 )S(l + 2 \u2212 i 2 )\n(4.13)\nd\u22121\n\u03bb (l, m|J1 , J2 ) =\n\nwhere the parameter J is related to \u03c3 as \u03c3 = 2J + 1. This makes it clear\nthat we need to identify is = \u03c3, just as with the one-point functions. One\ncan observe that with this identification, these two expressions agree upto\na normalization factor which we observe to be the square root of the factor\nin (3.28), (3.29) as expected for a boundary operator.\n\n25\n\n\f5\n\nClosing Remarks\n\nWe have revisited the correspondence between the topological cigar at level\none and the c = 1 string theory and clarified the discussion in [1] regarding\nthe mapping of bulk operators. We have reproduced the states listed in\nthe appendix of [1] in our analysis, and in our description the identification\nof the states in the list as null vectors in the Verma modules of the affine\nSL(2, IR) current algebra is made manifest.14 The same procedure also\nallowed us to precisely map the states in the list to specific representatives\nof the topological observables using the Wakimoto variables.\nWe also showed that the states in the (twisted) super-coset to which the\nstates of the c = 1 string are mapped, descend\nthe Hilbert space of\nP from\n+w\nthe parent SL(2, IR)1 theory derived in [23], w D\u2212j=1/2 . The states that\nnaively seem to descend from representations labeled by different j values\nare understood to descend from the spectrally flowed representations.\nThese results teach us a little about the relation of the topological theory\non the cigar with the physical superstring theory. To compare the spectrum\nand correlation functions in the A model on the cigar to those of the c =\n1 theory, we use the untwisted cigar SCFT and restrict to states which\nformally obey the chiral primary condition. Most of these states are not of\ndimension one, but could be tensored with other states to produce on-shell\nstates in a superstring theory on a larger spacetime involving the cigar, as\ndone in [3, 35].\nWe matched the one point functions that define the D0/D2 branes in\nthe topological coset with the ZZ/FZZT branes of the c = 1 string theory.\nFurther, we mapped the open string deformations for the two kinds of branes\nand also the boundary two point function on the extended D2 and FZZT\nbrane. The statements in the above paragraph also apply to the open string\nmodes on the branes in the topological theory.\nAt various places in the paper, we have a discussion of the SU (2) symmetry intrinsic to the c = 1 theory. The closed c = 1 string theory has a\nSU (2) \u00d7 SU (2) symmetry, and this is also a symmetry of the topological\nstring theory on the coset. However, the currents that generate these symmetries are not dimension one currents in the untwisted SCFT and and so\ndo not generate symmetries of the superstring theory involving this coset\n(e.g. cigar \u00d7IR1,3 ).\nBoth the ZZ and the FZZT branes (and their topological counterparts)\n14\n\nWe believe that our analysis may clarify properties of the c = 1 cohomology used\nin the comparison of the c = 1 string amplitudes to the amplitudes derived from the\nLandau-Ginzburg model as described in [15].\n\n26\n\n\fpreserve a diagonal\nSU (2). The D2/FZZT branes have three marginal op\u221a\nerators (e\u00b1i 2X , \u2202X) which correspond to motion in the directions of the\nbroken generators. On the D0/ZZ brane, one of these operators (\u2202X) becomes null, and only its zero mode survives. Based on the identification of\nthe closed string theory with the topological theory on the deformed conifold,\nit is natural to identify the localized (compact) brane with the Lagrangian\nbrane wrapping the S 3 of the deformed conifold.\nWe believe that our analysis could be useful in recovering the BPS sector\nof the gauge theory physics for branes on the conifold from an exact worldsheet description. It would be especially interesting to apply similar techniques to more general non-compact Calabi-Yau manifolds. For instance, it\nwould be instructive to compute the superpotential for scalars arising from\ncombinations of D-branes wrapping cycles in the Calabi-Yau purely from\nthe worldsheet theory.\nOur analysis could also be helpful to better understand the topological\nsubsector of the AdS/CFT correspondence, and more generally, holography.\nRecently, it was shown [35] that the Liouville field emerges as a holographic\ndirection in topological theories involving the SL(2) current algebra. In the\nlast couple of years, holography in theories involving the Liouville theory\nhas been understood better using D-branes in these theories [25, 21]. The\nidentification of the D-branes in c = 1 and the D-branes in the topological\ncigar goes a step towards completing this circle of ideas.\nWe close by noting that the techniques used to map the closed string\nobservables are not specific to the cigar at level one. In particular, one\ncan do a similar computation for the c < 1 theories coupled to Liouville\ntheory. Recently it was suggested in [40] that these are related to c < 1\nnon-minimal matter coupled to Liouville. It would be interesting to repeat\nthe null vector analysis for SL(2, IR) at general level k to get a better grip\non the cohomology of the twisted supercosets, i.e. of the topological string\non these N = 2 superconformal backgrounds, from first principles.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Bobby Acharya, Freddy Cachazo, Eleonora Dell'Aquila,\nEmanuel Diaconescu, Edi Gava, K.

We follow the conventions of [14, 18] and references therein. The primaries of the bosonic SL(2, IR)k+2 are denoted\nVmj bos mbos , where mbos is the charge under the purely bosonic j 3 current\n\nj\n\n3\n\n(z)Vmj bos mbos (0)\n\nmbos Vmj bos mbos\n\u223c\nz\n\nj\n\n3\n\n(z)Vmj bos mbos (0)\n\nmbos Vmj bos mbos\n.\n\u223c\nz\n(A.1)\n\nThey have (left and right) conformal dimensions\n\u2206(Vj,mbos ,mbos ) = \u2206(Vj,mbos ,mbos ) = \u2212\n\nj(j + 1)\n.\nk\n\n(A.2)\n\nAs these fields are independent of the free fermions, they are also primary\nfields of the superconformal SL(2, IR) at level k. In order to obtain the\nprimaries of the coset, it is useful to bosonize the various currents as follows:\nr\nk\n\u2202X3\ni\u2202H = \u03c8 + \u03c8 \u2212\nJ3 = \u2212\n2\nr\nr\nc\nk+2\nJR = i\n\u2202XR\nj3 = \u2212\n\u2202x3 ,\n(A.3)\n3\n2\nwhere the normalizations ensure that the scalars have canonical OPEs. Since\nwe have left-right symmetric conventions, there are similar expressions for\nthe right-moving sector as well. These scalars are not all independent and\nusing the definition of the bosonic currents and the N = 2 algebra (2.3), we\ncan rewrite all scalars in terms of X3 and XR :\nr\nr\nr\nr\nk\nk+2\n2\nk+2\nx3 = \u2212iXR +\nX3\nand\niH = \u2212\nX3 + i\nXR .\n2\n2\nk\nk\n(A.4)\nThe right moving currents have a similar expansion in terms of scalars.\nGiven these expressions, and knowing that the current that is gauged in the\n28\n\n\fcoset are j 3 (in the bosonic case), we can decompose\nq\n\nVmj bos ,mbos = \u03a6jmbos ,mbos e\n\u2261\n\n2\n(mbos x3 +mbos x3 )\nk+2\n\nq\n2\n\u221a 2i\n(mbos XR +mbos X R )\n(m X +m X )\nj\n(k+2)k\n\u03a6mbos ,mbos e\ne k bos 3 bos 3(A.5)\n\nwhere \u03a6jmbos ,mbos is a primary of the bosonic Euclidean coset CFT (at level\nk + 2).

The extended algebra is associative provided the\ncurrents satisfy some extra conditions [28]. A few explicit realizations of the\nassociative extended current algebra in terms of minimal models are known.\nIn this appendix, we exhibit another realization of this extended current\nalgebra, on the superconformal cigar at central charge c = 9. We realize the\nalgebra explicitly in terms of asymptotic variables on the cigar (or N = 2\nLiouville theory). We then remark on how the operators that extend the\nalgebra map into the c = 1 bosonic string theory.\nIt was shown in [28] that a left-moving N = 2 superconformal algebra at\ncentral charge c = 9 allows for an extension by two currents of spin 3/2 and\ncharges \u00b13 (which we denote by R and R\u2217 ) and two currents of spin 2 and\ncharges \u00b12 (namely Y and Y \u2217 ). A constructive way to find this extension\nis to first consider the operators R and R\u2217 , which are (standard) spectral\nflow operators, and then to close the algebra using the OPE's. It can be\nshown that the resulting algebra is associative provided some extra relations\nbetween the currents are satisfied [28]:\n(J R R)(z) = \u2202R(z)\n\n1\n(J R Y ) + (G\u2212 R) = \u2202Y (z).\n2\n\n(B.1)\n\nThe algebra in the general case was given in terms of the modes of the\ncurrents in [28].\nWe remark in passing that at large volume, the currents R can be constructed using the fact that a unique holomorphic three-form exists on a\nCalabi-Yau threefold. (For c = 6, there exists a similar extension of the\ncurrent algebra, leading to a small N = 4 superconformal algebra. Also\nfor higher values of the central charge, currents associated to holomorphic\nforms on the CYn spaces can be defined. And, indeed, worldsheet currents\ncan be associated to forms on special holonomy manifolds, generically.)\n\n30\n\n\fIn summary, we conclude that in the cigar or Liouville conformal field\ntheory at central charge c = 3+ k6 , and at k = 1, we can enlarge the standard\nN = 2 superconformal algebra with the above currents.\n\nIn asymptotic variables\nIn the following, we exhibit explicitly the realization of the N = 2 superconformal algebra in\u221aterms of asymptotic coordinates on the cigar (where in\nthis appendix Q = 2). We first recall the N = 2 superconformal algebra\nin these variables (see e.g. [26]):\n1\nTas = \u2212 (\u2202\u03c1\u2202\u03c1 + \u2202\u03b8\u2202\u03b8 + \u03c8\u03c1 \u2202\u03c8\u03c1 + \u03c8\u03b8 \u2202\u03c8\u03b8 + Q\u2202 2 \u03c1)\n2\n1\nG\u00b1\nas = \u221a (i(\u03c8\u03c1 \u00b1 i\u03c8\u03b8 )(\u2202\u03c1 \u2213 i\u2202\u03b8) + iQ(\u2202\u03c8\u03c1 \u00b1 i\u2202\u03c8\u03b8 ))\n2\nR\nJas = \u2212i\u03c8\u03c1 \u03c8\u03b8 + iQ\u2202\u03b8.\n\n(B.2)\n\nWe also define the useful quantities:\n1\n\u00b1\n\u03c8cig\n= \u221a (\u03c8\u03c1 \u00b1 i\u03c8\u03b8 )\n2\n+ \u2212\n\u2212i\u03c8\u03c1 \u03c8\u03b8 = \u03c8cig \u03c8cig = i\u2202H.\n\n(B.3)\n\nWe now wish to extend this standard N = 2 algebra and show that it closes\non itself, and that it does satisfy the associativity condition. We define\nfirst of all the left-moving currents which are exponentials in the free boson\ncorresponding to the U (1)R current, and which have dimension 3/2 and\ncharge 3:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nR = 2eiH+i 2\u03b8 = 2\u03c8 + ei 2\u03b8\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(B.4)\nR\u2217 = 2e\u2212iH\u2212i 2\u03b8 = 2\u03c8 \u2212 e\u2212i 2\u03b8 .\nNext we record the currents Y and Y \u2217 that arise from considering the OPE's\nof these currents with the supercurrents. These are currents with dimension\n2 and charges \u00b12:\n\u221a\ni \u221a\nY = \u221a ei 2\u03b8 (\u2202\u03c1 + i\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 i 2\u03c8\u03b8 \u03c8\u03c1 )\n2\n\u221a\n\u221a\ni\nY \u2217 = \u221a e\u2212i 2\u03b8 (\u2202\u03c1 \u2212 i\u2202\u03b8 + i 2\u03c8\u03b8 \u03c8\u03c1 ).\n2\n\n31\n\n(B.5a)\n(B.5b)\n\n\fThis explicit realization of the algebra can now be used to check straightforwardly that the equations (B.1) for associativity are satisfied. This gives\na new and interesting representation of the extended N = 2 superconformal\nalgebra at c = 9.\nSince we haven't found an encoding of the extended algebra in terms of\nOPE's in the literature (although it immediately follows from the algebra in\nterms of the oscillators [28]), we record it here for the readers convenience :\n\nG\u2212 (z)R(w) \u2243\nG+ (z)R\u2217 (w) \u2243\n\n2Y (w)\n(z \u2212 w)\n2Y \u2217 (w)\n(z \u2212 w)\n3R(w)\n(z \u2212 w)2\n3R\u2217 (w)\n(z \u2212 w)2\n2\n(z \u2212 w)3\nG+ (w)\n(z \u2212 w)2\nG\u2212 (w)\n(z \u2212 w)2\n\n(B.6a)\n(B.6b)\n\n\u2202R(w)\nz\u2212w\n\u2202R\u2217 (w)\nG\u2212 (z)Y \u2217 (w) \u2243\n+\nz\u2212w\n2J R (w)\n(J R )2 (w) + \u2202J R (w)\n+\n+\nR(z)R\u2217 (w) \u2243\n(z \u2212 w)2\n(z \u2212 w)\nR\n+\n(J G )(w)\n+\nR(z)Y \u2217 (w) \u2243\n(z \u2212 w)\n(J R G\u2212 )(w)\nR\u2217 (z)Y (w) \u2243\n\u2212\n(z \u2212 w)\n1\nR 2\nR\n2J R\n3\n2 (J ) + T + \u2202J\n+\n+\nY (z)Y \u2217 (w) \u2243\n(z \u2212 w)4 (z \u2212 w)3\n(z \u2212 w)2\n\u2212 1 (G+ G\u2212 ) + (T J) + 41 \u2202((J R )2 ) + \u2202T\n.\n+ 2\n(z \u2212 w)\nG+ (z)Y (w) \u2243\n\n+\n\n(B.6c)\n(B.6d)\n(B.6e)\n(B.6f)\n(B.6g)\n\n(B.6h)\n\nWe have checked all these OPE's on the representation in terms of asympotic\nvariables, and also that the currents R, R\u2217 , Y and Y \u2217 have the correct OPE's\nwith the energy-momentum tensor and the U (1)R current in accord with\ntheir conformal dimension and R-charge. All other OPE's (except for the\nstandard N = 2 superconformal algebra OPE's that are not mentioned\nabove) are regular.\n\nMapping the algebra onto the c = 1 string\nWe can embed this well-known symmetry structure in the standard realization of supersymmetric string theory, into the much larger symmetry group\n32\n\n\fof the topological string realization of a subsector of the theory. To that end,\nwe proceed to translate the currents constructed above into the c = 1 language. The map between the basic twisted N = 2 currents and the currents\nin c = 1 string theory has already been discussed in the bulk of the paper.\nIt remains to understand the currents R, R\u2217 and Y, Y \u2217 . The operator R is a\nchiral primary operator in the untwisted theory with conformal dimension\nand R-charge (\u2206, Q) = ( 32 , 3). From equation (3.8) in the bulk of the paper,\nit follows that it can be mapped to the left-moving part of the operator V\u2212 3 ,\n2\nwhich has the c = 1 representation\nR(z) 7\u2192 c e\u2212i\n\n\u221a\n\n2X(z)\n\n.\n\n(B.7)\n\nFrom the definition of the operator Y (z) in (B.6), and the mapping of the\nsupercurrent G\u2212 (z) in (2.12), we conclude that\n\u2212i\nY (z) = G\u2212\n\u22121 * R(z) 7\u2192 \u03b2(z) e\n\n\u221a\n\n2X(z)\n\n.\n\n(B.8)\n\nThis is the integrand of the operator denoted K \u2212 (z) we introduced in (3.9).\nIt plays a crucial role in constructing representatives of the whole c = 1\nstring cohomology. We have thus identified a small subalgebra of the large\nsymmetry group of the c = 1 string with higher spin currents that are\nalready present in the full string theory.\n\nReferences\n[1] S.
