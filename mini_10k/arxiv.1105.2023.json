The\nmajority of approaches to the problem can be reduced to\nthe following main principles suggested by Bekenstein as\nearly as 38 years ago [2]:\n\u2022 The black hole is a composite object.\n\u2022 Constituents of a black hole responsible for black\nhole entropy reside on its event horizon; the area of\nthe horizon is quantized\nAn = \u2206A * n,\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, ...,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u2206A is the quantum of black hole area, \u2206A \u223c\nlP2 , so that the horizon surface consists of n identical\npatches - constituents of a black hole - each of area\n\u2206A. Then, if every patch can have k states, the\ntotal number of states of a black hole is\nW = kn .\n\n(3)\n\n\u2022 From the statistical mechanics point of view, the\nblack hole is a conventional object; in particular,\nthe entropy of a black hole is the logarithm of the\nnumber of states associated with its horizon,\nS = ln W = n ln k.\n\n(4)\n\nBecause the patches are independent of one another, the total entropy of a black hole is just n\ntimes the entropy of a single patch s1 = ln k.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ro@stc.gov.ua, ropotenko@i.ua\n\n\u2206Mn \u223c\n\n1\n.\nMn\n\n(5)\n\nFor convenience in the subsequent comparison, we shall\nrefer to the approach (model) based on these principles\nas the composite black hole approach (model ). However\nthese principles raise new puzzles. A puzzle is [3], that\nlocally there is nothing special about the horizon, so it\nis hard to see why it should behave as an object with\nthe local degrees of freedom (3). Another puzzle is that\nwe assign an entropy to something which is a classical\nsolution of the gravitational field equations, something\nwhich behaves like a soliton, but we do not usually assign\nan entropy to a soliton [4], [5]. One more puzzle is that\nthe black hole, although additive (4), is nevertheless an\nindivisible object. The next puzzle is related with the\nspectrum (5). It implies a discrete emission spectrum.\nBut if the black hole is a conventional object, then the\nseparation between subsequent energy levels should be\nexponentially small \u2206Mn \u223c exp(\u2212SBH ) and the emission\nspectrum is practically continuous. Finally, the greatest\npuzzle is the nature of black hole constituents and their\nquantum states. In connection with these 38-year puzzles\na question arises: Is it possible that this is not the point\nthat there is not yet quantum theory of gravity, but the\npoint is that our model is not completely adequate to the\nphysical nature of black holes?\nIn [6] a new approach to the problem of black hole entropy was developed and applied to a Schwarzschild black\nhole. It is based on the concept of internal angular momentum of a black hole Lz = A/(8\u03c0G). This approach\ndoes not need the concept of constituents for determining\nthe black hole entropy and is free of the difficulties of the\ncomposite black hole approach. The basic idea of the approach will be presented below. For convenience, we shall\nrefer to this approach (model) as the fundamental black\nhole approach (model ). The purpose of this paper is to\n\n\f2\nsummarize and extend this approach to a generic KerrNewman black hole. The Kerr-Newman case is more difficult than the Schwarzschild one. The point is that a\nKerr-Newman black hole has additional degrees of freedom related with rotation and electromagnetism. If the\nblack hole is a fundamental object, then these degrees of\nfreedom can give a contribution to the total degeneracy\nof the black hole. Note that the statistical interpretation\nof a Kerr-Newman black hole has been studied by many\nauthors but in the framework of the composite black hole\nmodel (the list of references is too long to be presented\nhere). Moreover, these authors ignored the problem of\nrotation of a symmetric structureless black hole in real\nspace from the quantum mechanical point of view.\nThe main results of the paper are as follows.\n\u2022 It is believed that the first law of black-hole mechanics\nk\ndM =\ndA + \u03a9dJ + \u03a6dQ,\n8\u03c0G\n\n(6)\n\nhas no independent physical significance and acquires it only after identifying with the first law\nof thermodynamics. It is argued that the first law\nof black-hole mechanics has a direct physical significance: not only the term \u03a9dJ but all terms in\nthe law have the same mechanical meaning - the\nrotational kinetic energy of a black hole in real or\ninternal space.\n\u2022 A black hole has rotational symmetries and no internal structure. Classically it can rotate about any\nof its axes (the Kerr solution). But from a quantum\nmechanical point of view such a motion is impossible. It is argued that the rotation of a black hole is\nnevertheless observable due to the dragging effect.\nMoreover, it is the dragging effect, that removes\nthe degeneracy with respect to the direction of J.\n\u2022 At first sight it seems that in the fundamental black\nhole approach all three terms in (6) should give\na contribution in the total degeneracy factor of a\nblack hole. But this is not so. The Kerr-Newman\nblack hole is a system of plane rotators represented\nby the corresponding terms in the first law of blackhole mechanics. That is, the first law of black-hole\nmechanics should read as\ndM = \u03c91 dL1z + \u03c92 dL2z + \u03c93 dL3z ,\n\n(7)\n\nrather than (6). Here \u03c9i are the angular frequencies\nand Liz are the z-components of the angular momenta of the black hole in the corresponding spaces.\nThe energy levels of rotators are non-degenerate.\n\u2022 The degeneracy of energy levels of a black hole\narises because the energy of a black hole does not\ndepend on where L1z is determined on the horizon.\nQuantization of L1z = A/(8\u03c0G) gives the equidistant area spectrum of a black hole with the area\n\nquantum \u2206A = 8\u03c0lP2 . Since the precision with\nwhich L1z can be determined equals to the size of\nthe area quantum \u2206A = 8\u03c0lP2 , the degeneracy of a\nblack hole is\nW =\n\nA\n.\n8\u03c0lP2\n\n(8)\n\nThat is why it is determined by the first term in\nblack hole mechanics.\n\u2022 The horizon is not a configuration surface with local\ndegrees of freedom but phase space (surface). Once\nwe have accepted this, the black hole entropy is no\nlonger arbitrary and uniquely determined by\nS = 2\u03c0W.\n\n(9)\n\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II\nwe consider the degeneracy in Kerr-Newman black holes.\nWe begin with the basic idea suggested early in [6]. Then\nwe consider a trouble with the first law of black-hole mechanics and argue that the law has independent physical\nsignificance. We also show that the Kerr-Newman black\nhole can be viewed as a system of non-degenerate plane\nrotators. Finally, we find the origin of black hole degeneracy. In Sec. III we consider some applications of our\napproach.\nII.\n\nTHE BLACK HOLE DEGENERACY\nA.\n\nThe basic idea\n\nIn [7] an internal angular momentum of a\nSchwarzschild black hole Lz = A/(8\u03c0G) was determined. Quantization of Lz gives the equidistant area\nspectrum of a black hole Am = \u2206A * m, m = 0, 1, 2, ...,\nwith the area quantum \u2206A = 8\u03c0lP2 . The number of\nmicrostates is intrinsically an integer. But exp(2\u03c0m)\nis not integral [8]. On the other hand, the energy of\na black hole does not depend on where Lz is located\non the horizon. The precision with which Lz can\nbe determined equals the size of the area quantum.\nTherefore, the number of states accessible to a black\nhole can be determined as m = A/8\u03c0lP2 . However,\nonce we have accepted this, the black hole entropy\nis uniquely determined by S = 2\u03c0(number of states)\n(not by S = log (number of states)). This means that\nthe black hole is a nonadditive object. This agrees\nwith the thermodynamical properties of a black hole.\nIn particular, the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is not\na homogeneous first order function of the black hole\nenergy. Moreover, we cannot divide a black hole into\ntwo independent subsystems by a partition as an ideal\ngas in a box (the area theorem). And the black hole\nconstituents cannot be extracted from a black hole.\nTherefore the black hole cannot be thought as made up\nof any constituent subsystems each of them endowed\n\n\f3\nwith its own independent thermodynamics [9]. We have\nto consider a single black hole as a whole system. On\nthe other hand, the black hole is a vacuum solution of\nthe gravitational equations and can be viewed as a kind\nof gravitational soliton i.e. as a physical object, localized\n\"within the event horizon\" and possessing a mass M .\nMoreover, for r > Rg the Schwarzschild coordinate t\nis timelike and the coordinate r is spacelike. But for\nr < Rg , t is a spacelike coordinate and r is timelike. So\n\"time\" and \"radial\" coordinates swap character when\nwe cross r = Rg . This looks like a twist of spacetime.\nThus the black hole should be viewed as a fundamental\nobject like an elementary particle or, rather, a string\n(because we can assign an entropy to the string). Of\ncourse, this idea is not new but rather folklore. 't Hooft\n[4] had already pointed out that there is no fundamental\ndifference between black holes and elementary particles,\nand Susskind and other researchers deepened this\ninsight still further [5]. According to this point of view\nthe spectrum of particles does not terminate at the\nPlanck mass but continues on to indefinitely large mass\nin the form of black holes. It is necessary to stress,\nhowever, that in our approach we do not postulate the\nfundamental character of black holes but rather derive\nit.\n\nB.\n\nThe degeneracy problem\n\nThe Kerr-Newman case is more difficult than the\nSchwarzschild one. The fact is that a Kerr-Newman black\nhole has additional degrees of freedom associated with rotation and electromagnetism. The first law of black hole\nthermodynamics and the generalized Smarr formula are\n(neglecting a hypothetical magnetic charge)\ndM = T dS + \u03a9dJ + \u03a6dQ,\n\n(10)\n\nan eigenvalue of a single-particle Hamiltonian and the\nentropy is a function of the total energy\nS = S(M ).\n\nThe degeneracy of the energy level M would then be a\nproduct of three degeneracy factors, one depending only\non A, one only on J (usually 2J + 1), and third only on\nQ. Is this true? To answer the question, we should investigate the nature of terms k(dA/8\u03c0G), \u03a9dJ and \u03a6dQ\nin the first law of black hole mechanics.\nC.\n\nThe trouble with the first law of black-hole\nmechanics\n\nIt is widely believed that the laws of black hole mechanics have no independent physical significance and acquire\nit only after identifying with the laws of thermodynamics. For example, the first law of black-hole mechanics\nreads\ndM =\n\nk\ndA + \u03a9dJ + \u03a6dQ.\n8\u03c0G\n\n(11)\n\nwhere M is the black-hole mass, T is the Hawking temperature, S is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, \u03a9 is the\nangular velocity, J is the angular momentum, \u03a6 is the\nelectric potential and Q is the electric charge of a black\nhole. According to statistical physics [10], the entropy of\na conventional composite body is a function of its internal energy alone. If the black hole is such an object, then\nits entropy is\nS = S(M \u2212 2\u03a9J \u2212 \u03a6Q),\n\n(12)\n\nand the additional degrees of freedom do not contribute\nto the black hole degeneracy. In statistical physics the\ninternal energy of a body is interpreted as the total of the\nkinetic and potential energy of all the constituents that\ncompose it. If the black hole is a fundamental object,\nthen this concept has no meaning. In this case M is\n\n(14)\n\nIt is nothing but a statement of energy conservation for\na black hole. Here, dM , is the change in mass (energy)\nof a black hole. The second and third terms on the right\nhand side are usually interpreted as changes in the energy due to rotation and electromagnetism. But the first\nterm with dA does not have a direct physical interpretation. As is well known, all basic conservation laws of\nenergy also contain a mix of terms of different nature,\nbut all these terms have clear physical meaning. In contrast to this, the first law of black-hole mechanics has no\nindependent physical significance and becomes meaningful after identifying with the first law of thermodynamics\nif one assumes the following expressions for the temperature and entropy of a black hole\nTH =\n\nM = 2T S + 2\u03a9J + \u03a6Q,\n\n(13)\n\nk\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nSBH =\n\nA\n.\n4lP2\n\n(15)\n\nThe same is true, of course, of the generalized Smarr\nformula (11). In what follows it will be convenient to use\nthe formula\nM = 2k\n\nA\n+ 2\u03a9J + 2\u0398Q2 ,\n8\u03c0G\n\n(16)\n\nwhere\n\u0398=\n\n\u03a6\n,\n2Q\n\n(17)\n\nand the surface gravity k, the angular velocity \u03a9, and the\nelectric potential \u03a6 are\nk=\n\nr+ \u2212 M\n2 + a2 ,\nr+\n\n\u03a9=\n\n2\nr+\n\na\n,\n+ a2\n\n\u03a6=\n\nQr+\n,\n+ a2\n\n2\nr+\n\n(18)\n\np\nHere r+ = M + M 2 \u2212 Q2 \u2212 a2 and a is the specific\nangular momentum, a = J/M . As is easily seen, all three\n\n\f4\nterms in (16) have the same structure of the form 2\u03c9i Li ,\nwhere \u03c91 = k, \u03c92 = \u03a9, \u03c93 = \u0398 and L1 = A/(8\u03c0G),\nL2 = J, L3 = Q2 . The factors \u03c9i are in turn very similar\nand have the same dimensions of frequency. The Li have\ndimensions of action. What does this mean?\n\nD.\n\nAn assumption\n\nIt turns out that the first law of black-hole mechanics\nhas a direct physical significance: not only the term \u03a9dJ\nbut all terms in the first law of black-hole mechanics have\nthe same mechanical meaning - the rotational energy of\na black hole in real or in an internal space. Namely, we\nassume that the Kerr-Newman black hole can be viewed\nas a system of plane rotators represented by the corresponding terms in the first law of black-hole mechanics.\nThat is, the first law of black-hole mechanics should read\nas\nX\n\u03c9i dLiz . (19)\ndM = \u03c91 dL1z + \u03c92 dL2z + \u03c93 dL3z =\ni\n\nrather than (14). Here \u03c9i are the angular frequencies\nand Liz are the z-components of angular momenta of a\nblack hole in real or in an internal space. Their concrete\nexpressions will be determined below. Accordingly\n\nlies outside or at the event horizon, r \u2265 2GM . In transforming from Schwarzschild to Euclidean Rindler coordinates the Schwarzschild time t transforms to a variable\n\u03c6 = kt in the Euclidean Rindler plane R2 , k = 1/(4GM ).\nBut the metric has a coordinate singularity corresponding to r = 2GM . Regularity is obtained if \u03c6 is interpreted as an angular coordinate with periodicity 2\u03c0. In\n[7], it was shown that there exists the z component of\nthe angular momentum which is conjugate to this angle,\nL\u0302z = i~\u2202/\u2202\u03c6 with an eigenvalue Lz = A/8\u03c0G. We call\nit Rindler angular momentum. In the Euclidean formulation the Rindler angular momentum and the Hawking\ntemperature have the same origin - the periodicity in the\nSchwarzschild imaginary time - and, therefore, the universal geometrical nature. The angular momentum L\u0302z is\nthe generator of rotations around z axis (this axis corresponds to r = 2GM ). Since there exists only one way\nof rotation, the black hole represents a plane rotator in\nan internal space. As early as 38 years ago, by proving\nthat the black hole horizon area is an adiabatic invariant, Bekenstein showed [2] that the quantum of black\nhole area is of the form \u2206A = 8\u03c0lP2 . In [7], by following\nthe approach used by Susskind [5] to derive the Rindler\nenergy, quantization of the black hole area (and entropy)\nwas obtained from the commutation relation and quantization condition for Lz . Namely, since\nLz =\n\nM = 2\u03c91 L1z + 2\u03c92 L2z + 2\u03c93 L3z = 2\n\nX\n\n\u03c9i Liz .\n\n(20)\n\ni\n\nMoreover, the energy levels of these rotators are nondegenerate, so that the degeneracy factors associated\nwith L1z , L2z and L3z do not give a contribution to the\ntotal degeneracy of a black hole. There are good reasons\nfor supposing that this is in fact so.\n\nA\n= m~,\n8\u03c0G\n\nm = 0, 1, 2, ... ,\n\n(21)\n\nthen\nA = 8\u03c0lP2 * m,\n\n(22)\n\nS = 2\u03c0 * m.\n\n(23)\n\nand\n\nThe energy of a Schwarzschild black hole in terms of a\nplane rotator is\nE.\n\nRotational terms: 2k(A/8\u03c0G)\n\nThe black hole entropy is a concept defined in the rest\nframe of an external fiducial observer. Moreover, the\nKerr-Newman metric extended into the region within the\nevent horizon cannot describe the spacetime inside the\nblack hole [11]. So, since we do not deal with the interior\nof a black hole, we regard the Euclidean formulation as\nthe more fundamental one. After all calculations with\nthe Euclideanized Kerr-Newman have been completed,\nwe analytically continue the results obtained back to real\nvalue of coordinate time t. Moreover, since the black hole\nentropy is associated with the event horizon, we deal only\nwith the Rindler section of the whole Euclidean KerrNewman manifold. The important fact is that in the\nnear-horizon approximation the metric of an arbitrary\nblack hole can be reduced to the Rindler form.\nFor example, the Rindler section of the Euclidean\nSchwarzschild manifold R2 \u00d7 S 2 is an analytic continuation of that part of the Lorentzian geometry that just\n\nM = 2\u03c9Lz = 2~\u03c9 * m,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = k is the frequency of a black hole in an internal\nspace associated with Lz . Note that Lz is an adiabatic\ninvariant as well as A.\nIn [6] it was suggested that quantization of a\nSchwarzschild black hole is nothing but the Landau quantization and a Schwarzschild black hole represents a twodimensional isotropic oscillator with an additional interaction \u03c9 L\u0302z , where \u03c9 = k. But the model of an oscillator\npresupposes a zero-point energy of a black hole in the\nabsence of the black hole which seems unlikely. In contrast, the spectrum of a plane rotator does not contain a\nzero-point energy. In what follows we shall use the model\nof a plane rotator. The model of a harmonic oscillator\ncan be considered only as an approximation; the model\nreduces to that of a plane rotator in the limit of large m.\nSetting t = \u2212i\u03c4 and reasoning as in the the\nSchwarzschild case, we can define the Euclidean KerrNewman metric [12]. This metric is complex and it\n\n\f5\nis asymptotically flat in a coordinate system rotating\nwith the angular\nvelocity of a black hole \u03a9. The locus\np\nr+ = M + M 2 \u2212 Q2 \u2212 a2 will be a conical singularity unless we identify the point (\u03c4, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) with the point\n(\u03c4 + i2\u03c0k \u22121, r, \u03b8, \u03c6+ i2\u03c0\u03a9k \u22121 ). As a result, the real coordinate time t transforms\np to an angular coordinate about\nthe \"axis\" r+ = M + M 2 \u2212 Q2 \u2212 a2 . Alternatively we\ncan in addition analytically continue in the specific angular momentum a and charge Q to get a real Riemannian\nmetric. In this case the Euclidean Kerr-Newman manifold has a structure identical to that of the Euclidean\nSchwarzschild manifold R2 \u00d7S 2 and, in particular, it covers only the exterior of a black hole and it also requires\nthe compactification of the Euclidean time in order to\neliminate a conical singularity. In an exactly similar manner to the Schwarzschild case, we can determine Rindler\nangular momentum of a Kerr-Newman black hole with\nthe quantized eigenvalues [7]\nL1z \u2261\n\nA\n= m~,\n8\u03c0G\n\nm = 0, 1, 2, ... ,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere A is the area of a Kerr-Newman black hole. Since\nthe Euclidean Kerr-Newman spacetime has no region corresponding to the region r < r+ in the Lorentzian spacetime, the negative integers m are ruled out (as mentioned\nin the beginning, continuation of the Lorentzian KerrNewman line element inside the surface of the horizon has\nno physical meaning at all). As in the Schwarzschild case,\nwe can consider the Kerr-Newman black hole as a plane\nrotator associated with the angular momentum. Analogously, the first term on the right hand side in (16) can\nbe regarded as the rotational energy of a Kerr-Newman\nblack hole\n2k\n\nA\n= 2\u03c91 L1z ,\n8\u03c0G\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03c91 = k is the angular frequency of the black hole\nin an internal space. As is well known, the energy levels\nof a plane rotator except the ground state is doubly degenerate (this follows from the fact that for every energy\nlevel the rotator can rotate both in positive and in the\nnegative direction). Since there are only positive values\nof m, the plane rotator does not give a contribution to\nthe total degeneracy of a black hole.\nF.\n\nRotational terms: 2\u03a9J\n\nAt first glance the rotation of a black hole in real space\nis impossible. A Schwarzschild black hole is spherical in\nshape apart from quantum fluctuations and has no internal structure. Classically, it can rotate about any of its\naxes. Analogously, a classical Kerr-Newman black hole\ncan rotate around its axis of symmetry. But from a quantum mechanical point of view the rotation of such objects\nis unobserved. A black hole cannot rotate, because any\nrotation leaves its horizon surface invariant and thus by\ndefinition does not change the quantum-mechanical state;\n\nthere is nothing \"inside a black hole\" to change its position during the rotation and there is nothing marked\non its surface to define the orientation. Moreover, no\norbiting spots can observed on the horizon, since all radiation from the horizon is infinitely redshifted. But our\narguments \"against the rotation\" are imperfect. Indeed,\nin Newton's theory a gravitational field is in no way dependent on the motion of matter. So the gravitational\nfields of a rotating sphere and the same sphere at rest are\ncompletely identical. But in Einstein's theory this is not\nso: a rotating sphere drags spacetime around itself. This\nphenomenon is known as the dragging of inertial frames.\nIt is also known as the Lense-Thirring effect. The effect\nis differential, stronger near the black hole and weaker\nat larger distances. Moreover, within the ergosphere the\ndragging is so strong that no object can remain at rest. It\nis the dragging effect, that makes the rotation of a black\nhole observable. Thus, illuminating space by a suitable\nbeam of test particles we may detect rotation of a black\nhole. And the degree to which the particles rotate is a\nmeasure of how rapidly this hole rotates.\nThe Kerr-Newman black hole is axially symmetric but\nnot spherically symmetric (i.e. rotationally symmetric\nabout one axis only which is the angular-momentum\naxis). Since the angular velocity \u03a9 is constant over the\nhorizon, the black hole rotates rigidly. Therefore we can\nregard the Kerr-Newman black hole as a rigid symmetric\nrotator or top. According to quantum mechanics [13],\nthe stationary states of a symmetrical top are described\nby three quantum numbers: the angular momentum J\n(J = 0, 1, 2, ...) and its components along the axis of\nthe top J\u03b6 = K (K = J, J \u2212 1, ..., \u2212J) and along the\nz-axis fixed in space Jz (Jz = J, J \u2212 1, ..., \u2212J). The degeneracy of each energy level of the top with K 6= 0 is\nW = 2(2J +1) because Jz can take 2J +1 different values\nfor a given value of J, and K can be either positive or\nnegative, corresponding to the two possible directions of\nrotation about the axis of angular momentum.\nBut we have ignored the frame-dragging effect. It turns\nout that when it is taken into account, the degeneracy\nfactor of a Kerr-Newman black hole is completely removed. To deduce this, it is not in fact necessary to\nsolve the equation J\u02c6\u03c8 = J\u03c8 in the Kerr-Newman metric; instead, we can argue as follows. First, a black hole\ndrags a fixed coordinate system about its axis of angular momentum. As a result, the stationary states of our\nsymmetrical top are determined only by the quantum\nnumber Jz . Secondly, the hole's rotation drags the coordinate system into orbital motion in the same direction\nas the hole rotates. As a result, the two-fold degeneracy\nwith respect to values of Jz are completely removed. As\nis well known, in order to compensate the dragging effect\nand to have a convenient family of observers for which\nevents at the same (Boyer-Lindquist) time are simultaneous, a family of zero angular momentum observers is\nused. These observers are at fixed r and \u03b8, but have a\nconstant angular velocity \u03c9 = d\u03c6/dt. An observer corotating with the frame-dragging angular velocity \u03c9 is in\n\n\f6\na state of zero angular momentum, and experiences no\ncentrifugal forces. From the point of view of such an\nobserver a Kerr-Newman black hole is viewed as a nondegenerate plane rotator rather than a symmetrical top.\nThus the second term on the right hand side in (16) is\nthe kinetic energy of rotation of a Kerr-Newman black\nhole in real space,\n2\u03a9dJ = 2\u03c92 L2z ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\n\u03c92 = \u03a9,\nG.\n\nL2z = Jz .\n\nThe third term 2\u0398Q2 is the change in the electrostatic\nenergy of a black hole. This term is also related with\nrotations but in an internal space. The electric charge\nis a conserved quantity. This is a consequence of invariance of the Lagrangian under the one-dimensional group\nU (1) of gauge transformations. This group is equivalent\nto O(2), the orthogonal group of rotations in a plane.\nTwo-dimensional rotations or gauge transformations belong to the Abelian group. As a result, the electric charge\nis additive in the same way as the z component of the angular momentum. On the other hand, the electric charge\nis quantized. But it is not known for certain why it is\nquantized. There have been many suggestions, including\nKaluza-Klein models [14], magnetic monopoles [15] and\ngrand unified theories [16] to explain the quantization of\nelectric charge. The important fact is that all these suggestions are closely related to the quantization of angular\nmomentum. For example, in the original Kaluza-Klein\nmodel charged particles are ones that go round in the\nfifth curled up dimension (neutral particles do not move\nin fifth dimension). The charge is proportional to the\nangular momentum of the motion round the curled up\nfifth dimension. In quantum theory, angular momentum\nis quantized, so charge is quantized. Note that when a\nKerr-Newman black hole is described in the framework\nof a five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model, the quantities\n\u03a9 and \u03a6 enter the expressions in a similar manner, and\ntheir properties are to a certain extent similar [17].\nWe shall assume that the electric charge of a black hole\nis an integer multiple of the fundamental unit of electric\ncharge e. Since the charge operator Q\u0302 is the generator\nof the U (1) gauge transformations, its spectrum of eigenvalues should be of the form\nn = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ...\n\n(29)\n\nThen\n2\u0398Q2 = 2\u0398(4\u03c0\u03b1n2 ~),\n\n2\u0398Q2 = 2\u03c93 L3z .\n\n(28)\n\nRotational terms: 2\u0398Q2\n\nQ = en,\n\nan analogy between the electric charge generating gauge\ntransformations and the z component of the angular momentum generating rotations in a plane. Secondly, as is\neasily seen from (30), the states of electrostatic energy\nof a black hole are doubly degenerate due to the factor\nn2 . This is just the degeneracy we should expect for a\nplane rotator. Therefore we can interpret the term 2\u0398Q2\nas the kinetic rotational energy of a black hole in an internal charge space and express it in terms of a plane\nrotator\n\n(30)\n\nwhere the definition of the fine structure constant \u03b1 =\ne2 /(4\u03c0~) has been used. At this point we should note\nthe following. First, as has been stated above, there is\n\n(31)\n\nNote that the interpretation of 2\u0398Q2 as the rotational\nenergy of a plane rotator has more formal significance\nthan that of 2k(A/8\u03c0G) and 2\u03a9J. Because of this, we\ndo not determine the frequency \u03c93 and the angular momentum L3z . Nevertheless, we shall use the form 2\u03c93 L3z\nto uniform the term 2\u0398Q2 with other rotational terms.\nFinally we must return to the degeneracy factor. The\npoint is that despite the existence of two kind of charges\nwith opposite signs in nature, the sign of the black hole\ncharge Q is given, so the energy levels of the rotator are\nin fact non-degenerate.\nH.\n\nThe origin of degeneracy\n\nAs has been shown above, a Kerr-Newman black hole\nhas three rotational degrees of freedom associated with\nthe angular momenta L1z , L2z and L3z . But these degrees of freedom do not give a contribution to the total degeneracy of a black hole. We did not determine\nL3z and \u03c93 explicitly. If we determined L3z and \u03c93 as\nL3z = Q2 and \u03c93 = \u0398, for example, we should have\nan additional degeneracy associated with \u03c9i . It is clear,\nhowever, that in this case all \u03c9i are linearly independent.\nSo, is there a degeneracy in black holes at all? It turns\nout that the energy of a Kerr-Newman black hole, as in\nthe Schwarzschild case, does not depend on where L1z\nis located on the horizon. The precision with which L1z\ncan be determined equals the size of the area quantum\n\u2206A = 8\u03c0lP2 . Therefore, the number of states accessible\nto a black hole can be determined as\nW =\n\nA\n.\n8\u03c0lP2\n\n(32)\n\nWe can imagine this as follows. Associate our rotator\nwith a vortex with the area of core \u2206A = 8\u03c0lP2 . Then the\nnumber of ways to place the vortex on the horizon is just\n(32), the ratio of the area of a black hole to the area of the\ncore. As a result, the (configuration) surface of the event\nhorizon becomes phase space of a black hole, as it should;\nas is well known, the phase space of a plane rotator is\ntwo-dimensional. Therefore, quantization of the black\nhole area and entropy is nothing but quantization of the\nphase surface\nS = 2\u03c0m.\n\n(33)\n\n\f7\nNote that string theory needs to introduce the notion of\na stretched horizon to avoid the problem of the local degrees of freedom. In loop quantum gravity, it is believed\nthat the only possible degrees of freedom on the horizon\nhave to be global or topological, described by a topological quantum field theory. According to the traditional\napproach we would have to take the logarithm of W .\nBut in this case the generalized second law of black hole\nthermodynamics (GSL) would be violated [6] (it appears\nthat much earlier, Gour and Mayo showed [18] that the\nformula for the black hole entropy S = f (A) with the\nfunction f (A) = ln A clashes with the GSL and must be\nexcluded). It turns out that once we have accepted the\nfact that the black hole degeneracy is proportional to the\narea, the black hole entropy is no longer arbitrary and\nuniquely determined by\nS = 2\u03c0W\n\nA.\n\nSOME APPLICATIONS\n\nSystem of black holes (and matter)\n\nTo avoid misunderstanding, we should add a clarifying remark concerning a system of black holes. Suppose,\nfor simplicity, that two black holes are far apart and\ntheir interaction is negligible, so that they can be viewed\nas statistically independent. Let S1(2) = 2\u03c0m1(2) and\nW1(2) = m1(2) be the entropy and degeneracy of the first\n(second) black hole, respectively. Then the number of\nstates for the combined system is W = W1 W2 = m1 m2 .\nWhat is the entropy of the system? Obviously, we cannot write the total entropy as S = 2\u03c0m1 m2 because our\nsystem is not a single black hole. It seems that we would\ntake the logarithm of W : ln W = ln m1 + ln m2 . But\nin this case, as mentioned above, we cannot interpret\nln m1(2) as the entropy of the first (second) black hole.\nDoes W = m1 m2 exist? Yes, it does. But ln m1(2) is not\nthe entropy of the first (second) black hole. Despite this\nfailure the laws of thermodynamics are still valid, so we\ncan define the entropy as\nS = S1 + S2 = 2\u03c0(m1 + m2 ).\n\n(35)\n\nAt this point we refer back to the meaning of the quantum number m. It is the angular (\"magnetic\") quantum\nnumber. Since interaction is weak, the angular momentum Lz of the whole system can be regarded as the sum\nof the angular momenta L1z and L2z of its parts,\nLz = L1z + L2z .\n\nm = m1 + m2 .\n\n(37)\n\nAccording to thermodynamics the entropy of combine\nsystem is additive. Thus the law of addition for the\nRindler angular momenta is nothing but a law of thermodynamics. We have considered the case of two independent black holes. But we can extend it to an arbitrary\nnumber of black holes (and matter).\nNote that the relation S = 2\u03c0m can be also viewed\nas the angular momentum quantization condition on the\nphase of wave-function: if the eigenfunction of Lz is to be\nsingle-valued, it must be periodic in phase, with period\n2\u03c0. So we can consider m also as a topological number\n(winding number). As has been shown above, it is an\nadditive number.\n\n(34)\n\n(not by S = log W ). This relation is the only way to reconcile the formula S = 2\u03c0m with the requirement that W\nbe integral. The absence of the logarithm means that the\nblack hole is a nonadditive object. Reasoning as in the\nthe Schwarzschild case (subsection A), we conclude that\nthe Kerr-Newman black hole is a fundamental object.\nIII.\n\nThen it follows that\n\n(36)\n\nB.\n\nThe mean separation between energy levels\n\nFrom (24) it follows that the separation between energy\nlevels of a black hole is\n\u2206Mn =\n\nm2P\n.\n2Mn\n\n(38)\n\nThis value is equal in order of magnitude to the width of\nenergy level Rg\u22121 . This value, however, does not agree\nwith estimation obtained from the usual definition of\nentropy, h\u2206Mn i \u223c exp(\u2212SBH ). As mentioned in Introduction, this compounds a problem in the composite\nblack hole approach. The fact is that in this approach\nthe energy levels should split due to unavoidable interactions between the constituents, so the mean separation between energy levels should be really \u223c exp(\u2212Sbh ).\nThis implies that the discreteness of the spectrum is very\nblurred and difficult to see observationally. In contrast,\nin the fundamental black hole approach there are no constituents, so there is no splitting and the discreteness can\nbe observed.\nC.\n\nThe relation Lz = \u03b1\u2032 M 2\n\nAlthough the black hole is a fundamental object, it is\nunstable and decays by emitting Hawking radiation (as is\nwell known, stability does not appear to be a criterion of\nthe fundamental nature). Therefore black holes can be\nviewed as resonant poles in the S-matrix for scattering\nof stable particles [19]. In this case there there should\nbe poles in the complex s plane (where the Mandelstam\nvariable s is the total center-of-mass energy squared) at\n2\nsm = M m\n\u2212 i\u0393m ,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u0393m is the width of energy level in the s plane\nand the energy spacing between the subsequent energy\nlevels of a black hole is given by (38). Srednicki noted\n\n\f8\n[19] that (38) is very unusual behavior for a set of resonances. Namely, its series never terminates. As is well\nknown, all known laboratory systems (for example, such\nas nuclei) have dense resonances, but always there is a\nthreshold above which the poles are replaced by a cut.\nIt turns out that the strange behavior of black hole resonances noted by Srednicki can be explained in our model.\nThe Schwarzschild black hole is \"the ground state of the\nKerr-Newman black hole\". So we restrict our consideration to uncharged, non-rotating black holes. The point\nis that the Rindler angular momentum Lz = 2GM 2 is\nproportional to the square of the mass of a black hole\nand increases without limit\nLz = \u03b1\u2032 M 2 .\n\n(40)\n\nHere we have introduced the notation \u03b1\u2032 = 2m\u22122\nP ; the\nreason for this will be clear in a moment. This resembles the well-known angular momentum - mass relation\nfor hadronic resonances. As is well known, the graph of\nthe angular momentum J of hadronic resonances against\n\n[1] R. M.

An\nargument is (see, for example, M. Maggiore, Phys. Rev.\nLett. 100, 141301 (2008)) that since the number of states\nis the exponential of a very large number, we cannot\ncalculate W with a precision of order one, necessary\n\ntheir mass squared falls into lines J = \u03b1\u2032 M 2 called Regge\ntrajectories. The constant \u03b1\u2032 is known as the Regge\nslope. Instead of terminating abruptly as in the case of\nnuclei, the graph continue on indefinitely, implying that\nquarks don't fly apart when spun too fast. In contrast to\nnuclei, there is no a threshold there. This is a manifestation of quark confinement. It has a simple explanation in\nthe string picture where the relation J = \u03b1\u2032 M 2 emerges\nnaturally from a rotating open string. In string model,\nhadrons are modeled by relativistically rotating strings\ncapped with massless quarks at both ends. For example,\nmeson resonances obey the relation J = \u03b1\u2032 M 2 with the\nslope \u03b1\u2032 \u223c (1 GeV)2 . Here the slope \u03b1\u2032 is inversely proportional to the string tension. But this is an effective\nstring theory. As is well known, to date string theory is\nconsidered as the unified theory of particle physics and\ngravity, so the slope of fundamental strings is determined\nby the fundamental constants of gravity and quantum\ntheory, \u03b1\u2032 \u223c m\u22122\nP . But it is just the slope of a black hole\n(40).\n\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n\nto distinguish an integer from a non-integer value. An\nobjection is that the entropy S is a continuously variable whereas W , being an integer, varies discontinuously.\nTherefore W is to be considered as just enormously large,\nso large that a change of one unit in W influences S to\nonly a vanishingly small degree. In our opinion, this is\nnot a problem of the precision of calculation: we do not\nneed, for example, to calculate W = exp(ln(2011)) with\na precision of order one, to know that W is integral.\nG.
