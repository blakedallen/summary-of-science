We study Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz functions whose values are continuous operators from a locally convex topological space which admits the\nfactorization property into its conjugate dual space. We show how this case\ncan be reduced to the case of functions whose values are bounded operators\nfrom a Hilbert space into itself.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the present paper we pursue our study of Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz functions in the\ncase of operator valued functions. In [3] we studied Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz1 functions whose values are bounded operators from a Banach space B into its conjugate\ndual space B \u2217 (that is, into the space of its anti-linear continuous functionals). The\npresent work is set in the framework of locally convex vector spaces which have the\nfactorization property. The methods and focus in [3] are different than those in\nthe present paper. In [3] we used in an essential way the theory of linear relations\nin Hilbert spaces, and we obtained realization theorems for Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz\nfunctions; see Theorem 1.1 below. Here the factorization property for positive operators in certain locally convex topological vector spaces plays a central role, and\nthe main point is the reduction to the Hilbert space case; see Theorem 4.2 below.\nLet V be a locally convex topological vector space, let V \u2217 denote the space of its\nantilinear continuous functionals and let\nh*, *iV\n\u2217\n\ndenote the duality between V and V . We shall denote by L(V, V \u2217 ) the space of\ncontinuous operators from V into V \u2217 and, more generally, by L(V, W) the space of\ncontinuous operators from V into another locally convex topological vector space\nW. For a Hilbert space H, L(H) stands for the space of bounded operators from H\ninto itself.\nAn operator A \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ) is said to be positive (notation: A \u2265 0) if\n(1.1)\n\nhAv, viV \u2265 0,\n\n\u2200v \u2208 V.\n\nThe space V is said to possess the factorization property if every A \u2265 0 in L(V, V \u2217 )\nadmits a factorization of the form\nA = T \u2217 T,\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 47Bxx,46A03.\nKey words and phrases. Positive kernels, locally convex spaces.\n1\nWe used the terminology Carath\u00e9odory function in [3].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDANIEL ALPAY, OLGA TIMOSHENKO AND DAN VOLOK\n\nwhere T is a continuous operator from V into some Hilbert space (depending on\nA). It was proved by J. Gorniak and A. Weron (see [7, Theorem 2.13 p. 240]) that\nV has the factorization property if and only if for every A \u2265 0 in L(V, V \u2217 ) the map\nv 7\u2192 hAv, viV\nis continuous. We remark that the results of [3] are in fact valid in any locally\nconvex vector space which has the factorization property, and this is the setting in\nwhich we consider the present work.\nAn L(V, V \u2217 )-valued function \u03a6 defined in the open unit disk D (but a priori without\nany analyticity property) is called a Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz function if the kernel\n\u03a6(z) + \u03a6(w)\u2217 V\n1 \u2212 zw\nis positive in D. We denote by C(V, V \u2217 ) the family of L(V, V \u2217 )-valued Carath\u00e9odoryHerglotz functions. In the case when V is a Hilbert space H we use the notation\nC(H).\n(1.2)\n\nK\u03a6 (z, w) =\n\nTheorem 1.1. Let V be a locally convex topological vector space with the factorization property, and let \u03a6 \u2208 C(V, V \u2217 ). Then there exist a Hilbert space H and\noperators C \u2208 L(V, H), V \u2208 L(H), D \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ), such that:\n(1) V is an isometry:\nV \u2217 V = IH\nand D is purely imaginary:\nD + D\u2217\n\n= 0;\n\nV\n\n(2) \u03a6(z) admits the representation\n(1.3)\n\n\u03a6(z) = D + C \u2217 (I + zV \u2217 )(I \u2212 zV \u2217 )\u22121 C,\n\nz \u2208 D.\n\nIn particular, \u03a6(z) admits (in the weak sense) the power series expansion\n(1.4)\n\n\u03a6(z) = M0 + 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz n Mn ,\n\nn=1\n\u2217\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhere the coefficients Mn \u2208 L(V, V ) are given by\n(\nD + C \u2217 C,\nif n = 0,\nMn =\nC \u2217 V \u2217n C,\nif n \u2265 1,\nand, therefore, \u03a6(z) is weakly analytic2 in the open unit disk D.\n\nProof. The representation (1.3) was originally obtained in [3] in the setting of Banach spaces; the proof in the present setting is absolutely the same.\n\u0003\nRemark 1.2. In the case when V is a Banach space, L(V, V \u2217 ) is a Banach space,\nas well, and weak analyticity is equivalent to strong analyticity; see [11, Theorem\nVI.4, p. 189]. Then \u03a6 is strongly analytic, which is also evident from the fact that\nthe coefficients Mn in (1.4) are uniformly bounded.\n2See [12, p. 80-81].\n\n\fCARATH\u00c9ODORY\u2013FEJ\u00c9R INTERPOLATION\n\n3\n\nRemark 1.3.

Given N \u2208 N and operators M0 , . . . MN \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ), such that the\nToeplitz operator matrix MN is positive, find a function \u03a6 \u2208 C(V, V \u2217 ) such that\n\u03a6(z) \u2212 (M0 + 2\n\nN\nX\n\nz n Mn ) = O(z N +1 ).\n\nn=1\n\nWe shall prove (see Theorem 4.1 below) that Problem 1.4 is always solvable. Furthermore, it turns out that \u03a6 \u2208 C(V, V \u2217 ) if and only if\n(1.8)\n\n\u03a6(z) = D + T \u2217 \u03c6(z)T,\n\nwhere D \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ) is purely imaginary, T \u2208 L(V, H) for some Hilbert space H and\nran(T ) = H, \u03c6 \u2208 C(H). Moreover, given \u03a6, the operator D is determined uniquely\n\n\f4\n\nDANIEL ALPAY, OLGA TIMOSHENKO AND DAN VOLOK\n\nwhile the operator T and the space H are determined up to unitary mappings.\nHence we can reduce interpolation problems for which the value of the function\n\u03a6 \u2208 C(V, V \u2217 ) is pre-assigned at the origin to interpolation problems for functions\n\u03c6 \u2208 C(H).\nThis last point explains also why formula (1.8) is much more precise and useful\nthan the seemingly similar formula (1.3). In (1.3) the operator C need not have\ndense range (in fact C can be chosen to be the adjoint of point evaluation at the\norigin), and the reduction mentioned above does not apply for (1.3).\nThe original motivation for [3] and for the present work originates with works on\nextrapolation stationary stochastic processes with values in a Banach space, or\nmore generally in a linear space; see for instance [8], [6], [10]. Our aim is to develop\nthe theory of de Branges-Rovnyak spaces, and associated problems such as inverse\nscattering (see [1], [2]) in the linear space case.\nThe paper consists of four sections besides the introduction. In the second section\nwe review some facts on locally vector spaces which have the factorization property.\nIn the third section we review the solution of the Carath\u00e9odory-Fej\u00e9r in the Hilbert\nspace case. The main results of this paper, including the characterization of a\nCarath\u00e9odory-Herglotz function in terms of its power series and the solution of the\nCarath\u00e9odory-Fej\u00e9r interpolation problem appear in Section 4.\n2. Preliminaries: spaces with the factorization property\nLet V be a locally convex topological vector space with the factorization property\nand let A \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ) be positive. We shall say that the factorization A = T \u2217 T,\nwhere T \u2208 L(V, H) and H is a Hilbert space, is minimal if the range of T is dense\nin H.\nProposition 2.1. Let V be a locally convex topological vector space with the factorization property and let A \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ) be positive. Let\n(2.1)\n\nA = T \u2217 T,\n\n(2.2)\n\nA = (T \u2032 )\u2217 T \u2032\n\nbe two factorizations via Hilbert spaces H and H\u2032 and assume that the factorization\n(2.1) is minimal. Then there exists an isometry V \u2208 L(H, H\u2032 ) such that T \u2032 = V T .\nMoreover, if the factorization (2.2) is also minimal then V is unitary.\nProof. The proof follows the argument in [7]. The formula\nR = {(T v, T \u2032 v),\n\nv \u2208 V} .\n\ndefine a relation on H\u00d7H\u2032 , which is isometric and has a dense domain; it is therefore\nthe graph of an isometric operator V . If the range of R is dense, as well, then V\nmust be unitary.\n\u0003\nProposition 2.2. Assume that V admits the factorization property. Then so does\nVN .\nProof. Let A be a positive continuous operator from V N into (V \u2217 )N . We consider\nthe matrix representation A = (Alj )l,j=1,...N , where Alj \u2208 L(V, V \u2217 ). We want to\n\n\fCARATH\u00c9ODORY\u2013FEJ\u00c9R INTERPOLATION\n\n5\n\nprove that the map\n(2.3)\n\n(v1 , . . . vn ) 7\u2192\n\n*\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb \uf8f6\nv1\nv1 +\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7 \uf8ec .. \uf8f7\nA\uf8ed . \uf8f8,\uf8ed . \uf8f8\nvN\n\nvN\n\nVN\n\nis continuous. The positivity of A implies that the operators All are positive. Since\nV has the factorization property, the maps\nv 7\u2192 hAll v, viV ,\n\nl = 1, . . . N,\n\nare continuous. Thus it suffices to show that the maps\n(2.4)\n\n(v, w) 7\u2192 hAlj w, viV\n\nare continuous for l 6= j.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that l < j. The positivity of A implies that\nthe operator\n\u0013\n\u0012\nAll Alj\nAjl Ajj\n\nis positive from V 2 in to (V \u2217 )2 .

We give a proof for completeness, using a one step extension procedure, as in\nfor instance [13]. Note that the spaces are not assumed to be separable.\nWe shall use the following formula (see [5, (0.3) p. 3]): let\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA B\nG=\nC D\n\n\f6\n\nDANIEL ALPAY, OLGA TIMOSHENKO AND DAN VOLOK\n\nbe such that A is invertible, then\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\nI\n0\nA\n(3.1)\nG=\nCA\u22121 I\n0\n\n0\nD\u00d7\n\n\u0013\u0012\nI\n0\n\n\u0013\nA\u22121 B\n,\nI\n\nwhere D\u00d7 = D \u2212 CA\u22121 B is called the Schur complement of D.\n\nTheorem 3.1. If V = H is a Hilbert space then Problem 1.4 is solvable.\nProof. We replace MN by \u01ebIHN +1 + MN , where \u01eb > 0. This last operator is strictly\npositive (that is, positive and boundedly invertible):\n\u01ebIHN +1 + MN > 0.\nWe set\n\u22121\n\n(\u01ebIHN +1 + MN )\n\n\u2217\n\u03b2N\n\u03b4N\n\n\u0012\n\u03b1N\n=\n\u03b2N\n\n\u0013\n\nand\n\nMN\n\n\u0001\n. . . M 1 = \u03b3N ,\n\nwhere, to lighten the notation, we do not stress for the moment the dependence on\n\u01eb. Let X \u2208 L(H). In view of (3.1), we see that the Toeplitz matrix\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX\u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\u01ebIHN +1 + MN\n\u03b3N\nX\n\u03b3N\n\u01ebIH + M0\nis strictly positive if and only if\n\n\u0012 \u2217\u0013\n\u0001\nX\n\u03b3N (\u01ebIHN +1 + MN )\u22121\n.\n\u2217\n\u03b3N\n\n\u01ebIH + M0 > X\n\nUsing 3.1, the last inequality can be rewritten as\n(3.2)\n\n\u00d7 \u2217\n\u22121\n\u2217\n\u01ebIH + M0 \u2212 \u03b3N \u03b4N\n\u03b3N > (X + \u03b3N \u03b2N \u03b1N\n)\u03b1N (X + \u03b3N \u03b2N \u03b1\u22121\nN ) .\n\nBut the operator on the left hand side of (3.2) is the Schur complement of \u01ebIH + M0\nin \u01ebIHN +1 + MN , which is strictly positive. Hence the operator ball defined by (3.2)\nis non-empty. Setting MN +1 (\u01eb) = X, where X satisfies (3.2), we obtain MN +1 > 0.\nReiterating this procedure we can choose a sequence of operators\nMN +1 (\u01eb), MN +2 (\u01eb), . . .\nsuch that all the corresponding Toeplitz matrices\nMN +1 (\u01eb), MN +2 (\u01eb), . . .\nare strictly positive. The corresponding function\n\u03a6\u01eb (z) = M0 + 2\n\nN\nX\n\nMk z k + 2\n\nis in the Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz class since\n\u03a6\u01eb (z) + \u03a6\u01eb (w)\u2217\n1 \u2212 zw\n= 2 lim z n IH z n\u22121 IH\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n***\n\nMk (\u01eb)z k\n\nk=N +1\n\nk=1\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u0001\nIH Mn (\u01eb) wn IH\n\nwn\u22121 IH\n\n***\n\nIH\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n.\n\nThe positivity of the matrices Mn (X) implies, much in the same way as in the\nproof of Proposition 2.2, that the operators Mn (\u01eb) are uniformly bounded in norm\nfor \u01eb \u2264 1. We now want to let \u01eb \u2192 0. We use the fact (see for instance [4, Chapter\n\n\fCARATH\u00c9ODORY\u2013FEJ\u00c9R INTERPOLATION\n\n7\n\n5]) that L(H) is the dual space of the trace class operators in L(H), and hence, by\nBanach-Alaoglu theorem (see [4, Lemma 2.3, p. 102]) the closed unit ball of the\nspace L(H) is weakly compact. Let now \u01ebk , k = 0, 1, . . . be a sequence of numbers\ndecreasing to 0. Since rank one operators are trace class, we can find a subsequence\n\u01eb1,k and an operator MN +1 \u2208 L(H) such that\nlim hMN +1 (\u01eb1,k )x, yiH = hMN +1 x, yiH ,\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 H.\n\nSimilarly there exists a subsequence \u01eb2,k of the sequence \u01eb1,k and an operator\nMN +2 \u2208 L(H) such that\nlim hMN +2 (\u01eb2,k )x, yiH = hMN +2 x, yiH ,\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 H.\n\nUsing the diagonal argument, we find a sequence of bounded operators Mn , n > N\nand a sequence of numbers \u03b7k = \u01ebk,k decreasing to 0 such that\nlim h\u03a6\u03b7k (z)v, wi = h\u03a6(z)v, wi,\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nP\u221e\nwhere \u03a6(z) = M0 + 2 n=1 z n Mn . The function \u03a6 is a Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz\nfunction. Indeed, for every k the kernel K\u03a6\u03b7k (z, w) is positive. Thus for every\nchoice of n \u2208 N, z1 , . . . , zn \u2208 D and h1 , . . . , hn \u2208 H the n \u00d7 n matrix with lj entry\nequal to\nhK\u03a6\u03b7k (zl , zj )hj , hl iH\nis positive. Letting k \u2192 \u221e we get that the kernel K\u03a6 (z, w) is positive in D.\n\n\u0003\n\n4. Characterization of a Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz function in terms\nof its power series\nAs already noticed, the space V N has the factorization property when V has. As a\nconsequence we have:\nTheorem 4.1. Let N \u2208 N and let M0 , . . . , MN be continuous operators from V\ninto V \u2217 . Assume that the Toeplitz block operator matrix MN given by (1.7) is a\npositive operator from V N +1 into (V \u2217 )N +1 . Let\nM0 + M0\u2217 |V\n= T0\u2217 T0 ,\n2\nwhere T0 is a continuous operator from V into a Hilbert space H0 with dense range.\nThen there exist a unitary operator U from H0 into itself and a bounded operator\nC from H0 into itself such that\n(4.1)\n\nM0 + M0\u2217 |V\n= T0\u2217 C \u2217 CT0\n2\n\nand\n\nMj = T0\u2217 C \u2217 U j CT0 ,\n\n, j = 1, . . .

Write\n\u0001\nF = F0 F1 * * * FN .\n\nWe have in particular\n\nM0 + M0\u2217 |V\n= F0\u2217 F0 = F1\u2217 F1 = * * * = FN\u2217 FN .\n2\nBy Proposition 2.1, there exist isometries V0 , . . . , VN from H0 into H such that\nFj = Vj T0 ,\n\nj = 0, . . . , N.\n\n\u2217\n\nLet j > i. The equality MN = F F leads to\n(4.2)\n\nMj = T0\u2217 V0\u2217 Vj T0 = T0\u2217 V1\u2217 Vj\u22121 T0 = * * * = T0\u2217 Vi\u2217 Vj\u2212i T0 .\n\nIn view of (4.2) we have:\n\uf8eb \u2217\nT0\n0\n\uf8ec 0 T0\u2217\n\uf8ec\n*\nMN = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec *\n\uf8ed *\n*\n0\n*\n\uf8eb\n(4.3)\nI\n\uf8ec V1\u2217 V0\n\uf8ec \u2217\n\u00d7\uf8ec\n\uf8ec V2 V0\n\uf8ed *\nVN\u2217 V0\n\n0\n0\n*\n*\n\n***\n***\n*\n*\n\nV0\u2217 V1\nI\nV1\u2217 V0\n*\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\u00d7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nT0\u2217\n\n***\nV0\u2217 V1\nI\n*\n\nV0\u2217 VN\n***\n*\n*\nI\n\nFurthermore the block Toeplitz operator\n\uf8eb\nI\nV0\u2217 V1\n***\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8ec V1 V0\nI\nV\n0 V1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec *\n*\n*\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed *\n*\n*\nVN\u2217 V0\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\nT0\n\uf8f7\uf8ec 0\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8ec *\n\uf8f7\uf8ec\n\uf8f8\uf8ed *\n0\n\nV0\u2217 VN\n***\n*\n*\nI\n\n0\nT0\n*\n*\n*\n\n0\n0\n*\n*\n\n***\n***\n*\n*\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\nT0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\u22650\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nsince T0 has dense range. The problem is thus reduced to the Hilbert space case,\nand Theorem 3.1 is applicable. The proof is now easily completed.\n\u0003\nWe now turn to the main result of this paper:\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let M0 , M1 , . . . be an infinite sequence of elements of L(V, V \u2217 ) such\nthat all the matrices MN defined by (1.7), N = 0, 1, . . ., are positive. Then for every\nz in the open unit disk, the series\n\u03a6(z) = M0 + 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nz n Mn\n\nn=1\n\nconverges weakly, and defines a Carath\u00e9odory-Herglotz function. Furthermore, \u03a6\ncan be written as (1.8):\n\u03a6(0) \u2212 \u03a6(0)\u2217 Vv\n+ T0\u2217 \u03c6(z)T0 .\n2i\nConversely, every function of the form (1.8) belongs to C(V, V \u2217 ).\n\u03a6(z) =\n\n\fCARATH\u00c9ODORY\u2013FEJ\u00c9R INTERPOLATION\n\n9\n\nProof: From the proof of Theorem 4.1 follows that that there is a Hilbert space\nH0 and an operator T0 \u2208 L(B, H0 ) with dense range and such that for every N \u2265 0,\nMN = diag (T0\u2217 , . . . T0\u2217 )TN diag (T0 , . . . , T0 ),\nwhere TN is a uniquely defined positive block Toeplitz operator from H0N +1 into\nH0N +1 . Since the TN are uniquely defined, they are of the form\nTN = (ti\u2212j )i,j=0,...N ,\nwhere the tj are bounded operators from H0 into itself. As in the proof of Theorem\n3.1 (see (3.3)), the function\n\u221e\nX\n\u03c6(z) = t0 + 2\ntn z n\nn=1\n\nbelongs to C(H0 ), and (1.8) holds with \u03c6.\nThe converse follows from\n\nK\u03a6 (z, w) = T0\u2217 K\u03c6 (z, w)T0 .\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] D.
