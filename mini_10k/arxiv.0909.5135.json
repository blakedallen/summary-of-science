Introduction\nBoth HD 51106 and HD 50747 have been observed with CoRoT\n(Baglin et al. 2006). They were secondary targets observed in\nthe asteroseismology field during the initial run of the satellite.\nThe choice of HD 51106 was based on its spectral type (Am)\nin our search for possible variability. Since very few Am stars\noscillate (as reviewed in Kurtz, 2000), it is thus very interesting to investigate more thoroughly the link between pulsations\nand chemical pecularities with both the high sensitivity and frequency resolution of CoRoT. HD 51106 has a magnitude of 7.35\nHD 50747 was the brightest secondary target of this run, and\nhas a spectral type A4IV and a visual magnitude of 5.45. It was\nincluded in this study because of a previous classification as an\nAm star. Although its spectral classification has not yet been\ncompletely settled, this was a promising object for searching for\nvariability.\n\n\u22c6\nBased on observations obtained by CoRoT, a space project operated by the French Space Agency (CNES) with the participation of\nthe Science Program of ESA, ESTEC/RSSD, Austria, Belgium, Brazil,\nGermany, and Spain. Also based on observations made with ESO\ntelescopes at the La Silla Observatory under the ESO large program\nLP178.D-0361, at the Observatoire de Haute Provence, INSU/CNRS,\nFrance, and on observations collected at the Centro Astron\u00f3mico\nHispano Alem\u00e1n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the MaxPlanck Institut f\u00fcr Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrof\u0131\u0301sica de\nAndaluc\u0131\u0301a\n\nIn preparation for the CoRoT mission, extensive high resolution spectroscopy was completed to obtain more precise physical\nparameters of these stars.\nSection 2 presents an analysis of the pre-CoRoT spectroscopic observations of the stars, i.e., orbital parameters, fundamental parameters, abundance analysis. In Sect. 3, we describe\nthe CoRoT data, the method of analysis, and some characteristics of the Fourier transform. A discussion of the significance of\nthe observations, in terms of variable stellar class for HD 50747,\nand binarity effects for HD 51106, is given in Sect. 4.\n\n2. Ground-based spectroscopy\n2.1. The data\n\nThe spectra that we used were of three kinds, all obtained in the\nframework of the CoRoT seismology ground-based observation\nworking group. The logbook of the observations is provided\nin Table 1, which provides the names of the instruments used,\nthe date of the beginning and end of observations, the number\nof spectra obtained and their mean S/N, and the initials of the\nobservers. The SOPHIE spectrograph is mounted on the 1.93 m\ntelescope at Observatoire de Haute-Provence, France, FEROS\non the 2.2-m ESO/MPI telescope at ESO, Chile (Poretti et al.,\n2007), and FOCES on the 2.2-m telescope at the Observatory of\nCalar Alto in Almeria, Spain.\nSpectra were reduced using the software of each observing\nteam. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we computed the\n\n\f2\n\nN. Dolez et al.: HD 51106 and HD 50747: an ellipsoidal binary and a triple system observed with CoRoT.\n\ncorrelation profiles using the least square deconvolution (LSD)\nmethod (Donati et al. 1997). The spectral line list was chosen\nfrom the VALD database (Piskunov et al. 1995) concerning a\ntemplate (Teff,logg)=(8000,4). Common for both stars, this template matches the stellar parameters as closely as possible. All\nstellar lines apart from those of H and He are included in the\ndeconvolution. The correlation profiles derived have a signal-tonoise ratio above 700. For both stars, they are presented in Figs.\n1 & 2.\nTable 1. Logbook of the observations.

Orbital parameters\n\nTo determine the orbital parameters, we measured the velocities\nof the different components using a multi-Gaussian fit performed\non the corrrelation profiles. The solution for the binary orbits\nwas then computed using a Lehmann-Filhes' method-based\ncode that in addition calculated simultaneously the internal\nerrors (Lehman-Filhes 1894). Concerning HD 51106, it appears\nthat the eccentricity is very low (e < 0.01), so we imposed\na circular orbit. Although low, the eccentricity of HD 50747\nis significant, and we retained this value when computing\nthe orbital ephemeris. Note that we only used the velocities\ncomputed from a Gaussian fit. The binary parameters for both\nstars are given in Tables 2 & 3, and the corresponding orbital\nsolutions are represented in Figs. 3 & 4.\n\nFig. 1. Correlation profiles of HD 51106, from SOPHIE spectra.\nThe right axis is labelled in julian days (+2454100). The profiles\nare offset for clarity.\n\nThe case of HD 50747 is complicated because this star exhibits complex line profiles, with two narrow components belonging to a spectral binary (SB2) system, and at least a broad\ncomponent whose variation is very difficult to establish (Fig. 2).\nThis could be interpreted as being a triple system, with two close\ncomponents and a third, much brighter star responsible for at\nleast 80% of the total luminosity of the system. The orbital parameters of the two close components are listed in Table 3. The\nbright star has rapid rotation (see below), but no measurable radial velocity variation: we can therefore infer that this star is far\naway from the two others and the corresponding orbital motion\nis too slow to be measured with the current spectroscopic dataset.\n2.3. Fundamental parameters\n\nFig. 2. Correlation profiles of HD 50747, from SOPHIE spectra.\nThe right axis is labelled in julian days (+2454100).\n\nHD 51106 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary, and the two\ncomponents have similar masses. We assumed that both components of the system have similar fundamental parameters and\nestimated them using the composite Str\u00f6mgren photometry. We\nused two sets of photometric data: those of Hauck & Mermilliod\n(1998), and those of the Gaudi database (Solano et al. 2005).\nThese were dereddened using the code of Moon & Dworetsky\n(1985) and Moon (1985) (Table 4). The fundamental parameters\nfor HD 51106 are T eff = 7870 K and log g = 3.94 for the first\n\nset of data, and T eff = 8050 K and log g = 4.05 for the second\nset.\nHD 50747 is a triple system, consisting of one bright component, and two much fainter components. To date, we have been\nunable to disentangle the three spectra and derive the fundamental parameters of the individual components. We can only estimate the fundamental parameters of the brightest component,\n\n\fN.

By continuing to\napply the Moon & Dworetsky (1985) and Moon (1985) codes\nand the photometric data of Hauck & Mermilliod (1998) and\nof the Gaudi database, the fundamental parameters obtained for\nHD50747 are T eff = 7980 K and log g = 3.45 with the first set\nof data, and T eff = 7810 K and log g = 3.32 with the second set.\nThe discrepancies arise mostly from the difference in H\u03b2 for the\neffective temperature, and in c0 for the surface gravity.\n\nAttempts were made to fit synthetic spectra to the observed data.\nWe used the grids computed with the ATLAS9 (Kurucz 1993)\nLTE model atmosphere, extracting a 8000 K, log g = 4 model.\nThe synthesis was performed using a code developed by V.\nTsymbal (private communication) in LTE: the spectrum is convolved with an adequate instrumental and rotational profile.\nFor HD 51106, as a first attempt, we chose the spectral interval \u03bb\u03bb5500 \u2212 5535\u00c5, because the program used to disentangle the spectra (CRES, Ilijic 2004) can only deal with a very\nsmall span of data. This interval was chosen since it includes\nlines of several chemical elements of interest in the Am phenomenon, namely Ca, Sc, and Fe. For the disentanglement, we\nassumed that the luminosity ratio is around 1.45 according to\nthe standard mass-luminosity relation on the main sequence. For\neach component, we compared the disentangled spectrum with\ntwo synthetic spectra: the first one has solar abundances for all\nthe elements, whereas the second has Ca and Sc underabundant\ncompared to solar by a factor of 100, and Fe overabundant by a\nfactor of 10.\nIn Fig. 5, we see that in both components, Ca and Sc are clearly\nunderabundant (by a factor of 0.01), and Fe is almost solar or\nonly slightly overabundant. Further investigation is needed to\ndraw more precise conclusions. Nevertheless, confirming what\nis suggested by spectral classification, this system consists of\ntwo Am stars.\nAs a by-product, using the shape of the lines in the correlation profiles, we estimated the rotational velocity of the two\ncomponents (v sin i around 20 km s\u22121 ).\n\n\f4\n\nN. Dolez et al.: HD 51106 and HD 50747: an ellipsoidal binary and a triple system observed with CoRoT.\n\nFor HD 50747, we only tried to fit the lines of the brightest component, because, as indicated previously, we could not\ndisentangle the three spectra of the system at this stage. A solar abundance spectrum seems convenient, excluding any strong\nabundance anomaly. We could also estimate the rotational velocity of the brightest component (v sin i = 80 km s\u22121 ), and those\nof the fainter components (around 10 km s\u22121 ).\n1.1\n\nRelative flux\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\nCrII\n\nCaI\nFeI+FeI\n\n0.7\n\nFeI+FeII\nScII\n\nFeII\n\nMgI\n0.6\n\n5510\n\n5515\n\n5520\n\n5525\n\nFig. 6.

CoRoT Observations\nHD 51106 and HD 50747 were observed continuously over 60\ndays during the initial run of CoRoT which began on February\n7, 2007. The stars were secondary targets of the CoRoT asteroseismology field.\n3.1. HD 51106 light curve\n\nIn the CoRoT light curve (Fig. 6, upper panel), one immediately\nnotices a very regular oscillation, a slight modulation with twice\nthat period, and a slow temporal drift which can be attributed\nto CCD ageing (cf Auvergne et al. 2009, this issue). After substracting the drift, using a polynomial fit of the data, we pro-\n\nFig. 7. Upper panel: Fourier transform of the detrended light\ncurve. Lower panel: residual Fourier transform after extracting\nthe main frequency (0.499 d\u22121 ). The highest peaks correspond\nto the orbital period of the binary, and the others are linear combinations or harmonics. The phase of the oscillations at 0.499\nd\u22121 , 0.25 d\u22121 , and 0.75 d\u22121 are 0.95, 0.51, and 0.52, respectively.\n\nceeded to extract the frequencies using the Period04 software\n(Lenz and Breger 2005).\nThe Fourier transform detects two frequencies (Fig. 7, upper\npanel) close to 0.499 d\u22121 and 0.25 d\u22121 . We analysed the data, using prewhitening methods (included in the Period04 code). Apart\nfrom the above-mentioned frequencies, there are no other peaks\nin the power spectrum above the noise level, except for peaks\nthat are probably harmonics or linear combinations of those two\n(Fig. 7, lower panel) peaks caused by the spectral window, and\nlow frequency peaks related to the residual long period drift of\nthe data and jumps in the light curve. All significant frequencies,\neven the most conspicuous at 0.499 d\u22121 , can indeed be described\nas harmonics of the 0.25 d\u22121 one.\n\n\fN. Dolez et al.: HD 51106 and HD 50747: an ellipsoidal binary and a triple system observed with CoRoT.\n\n5\n\nTable 5. Period04 analysis results of HD 50747.\n\nFig. 8. Upper panel: detrended light curve of HD 50747. Lower\npanel: Power Spectrum (square root).\nIt is interesting to consider the residual light curve after\nsubstracting the main frequency (Fig. 6, lower panel). One can\nsee that the 0.25 d\u22121 oscillation is almost in phase with the main\nfrequency (its maximum being offset by about 0.15 period).\nWe can also clearly see that the next harmonic (0.75 d\u22121 ) has\na phase exactly opposite to that of the 0.25 d\u22121 oscillation,\nwith maxima of the former falling exactly within minima of the\nlatter. This combination results in a difference between even\nand odd minima, and also between even and odd maxima of the\nlight curve.\nThere is a very conspicuous jump in the data at around 48\ndays: this is clearly an instrumental effect that has been only partially corrected during the pre-reduction stages completed while\nobtaining the 'N2' data set. This effect appears when a CCD\npixel is affected by a cosmic ray. At our level of analysis, we did\nnot attempt to improve this, because it affects only very low frequencies (and somehow the noise level), and does not influence\nthe domain of frequencies of interest for this binary.\n3.2. HD 50747 light curve\n\nThe CoRoT light curve clearly exhibits variations, of an amplitude of about one thousandth of the total luminosity (Fig. 8, upper panel).\nThe Fourier transform (Fig. 8, lower panel) exhibits many\nfrequencies. The two main peaks are at F1=4.865 d\u22121 and\nF2=0.956 d\u22121 (periods of 4.93 hours and 25.1 hours, respectively). We analysed the data using the Period04 code (Lenz\nand Breger 2005) and found more than 40 significant frequencies: the frequencies listed in Table 5 all have an amplitude more\nthan 3 times larger than the noise level, which is estimated to be\n15.\u03bcmag in the domain 1 d\u22121 - 6 d\u22121 . We note that no significant\nfrequency was found above 6 d\u22121 , except for peaks caused by\nthe spectral window of the observations.\nIn this table, we did not include some very low frequency\npeaks, which we believe are caused by instrumental effects, such\nas, a slow drift of data or hot pixels correction. We could not\ndetect any clear effect of the orbital motion of the stars in the\ndataset: the orbital frequency (about 0.108 d\u22121 ) and its first harmonics were lost in the low frequency noise. We also tried to\nidentify a modulation of the oscillations by the orbital motion,\nwhich would appear as lateral peaks around, for example, F1\n\nF1\nF2\nF3\nF4\nF5\nF6\nF7\nF8\nF9\nF10\nF11\nF12\nF13\nF14\nF15\nF17\nF18\nF19\nF20\nF21\nF22\nF23\nF24\nF25\nF26\nF27\nF28\nF29\nF30\nF31\nF32\nF33\nF34\nF35\nF36\nF37\nF38\nF39\nF40\nF41\n\nFrequency\n\u03bcHz\nd\u22121\n56.309\n4.865\n11.070\n0.956\n4.787\n0.414\n25.381\n2.193\n11.804\n1.020\n67.383\n5.822\n8.262\n0.714\n40.985\n3.541\n12.997\n1.123\n39.320\n3.397\n5.710\n0.493\n17.909\n1.547\n28.056\n2.424\n14.019\n1.211\n33.271\n2.875\n28.271\n2.443\n15.628\n1.350\n35.905\n3.102\n31.232\n2.698\n5.230\n0.452\n23.246\n2.008\n36.602\n3.162\n37.385\n3.230\n10.740\n0.928\n45.144\n3.900\n13.658\n1.180\n4.309\n0.372\n31.437\n2.716\n32.759\n2.830\n15.786\n1.364\n68.125\n5.886\n33.575\n2.901\n4.913\n0.424\n15.314\n1.323\n30.782\n2.660\n13.216\n1.142\n40.863\n3.531\n7.422\n0.641\n32.265\n2.788\n68.548\n5.923\n\nAmplitude\n\u03bcmag\n465.326\n419.315\n218.525\n225.250\n200.361\n157.676\n137.349\n155.490\n115.464\n117.916\n111.093\n105.581\n86.470\n98.215\n95.513\n84.361\n57.912\n60.125\n66.914\n77.300\n60.237\n57.721\n56.063\n61.108\n54.500\n62.307\n59.474\n49.910\n56.642\n49.791\n48.071\n48.838\n60.885\n48.604\n47.912\n45.118\n70.136\n40.011\n41.449\n39.074\n\nComment\n\nF1+F2\n\nartefact?\n\nF1-F2\n\n(4.86 d\u22121 ), separated from it by the orbital frequency. From the\nparameters of the star system, we calculated that the amplitude\nof those peaks should be about 0.5% of the amplitude of F1, and\nthis is lower than the noise in this part of the spectra, even after\nsubstracting the oscillation F1 itself.\nTwo frequencies were identified as linear combinations of\nthe two main frequencies (sum and difference: F6 and F26 in\nTable 5). The frequency F22 is probably an observation artefact,\nrelated to the combination of satellite orbit and Earth rotation.\nThis frequency at 2.008 d\u22121 remarkably appears also in the spectrum of HD 51106. Since it is very close to an harmonic of the\norbital period of the star, it could easily be confused with it. The\nhigh resolution of CoRoT, because of the 60 days duration of the\nobservation, helped to prevent this confusion.\n\n4. Interpretation\nOur results for the two stars systems are very different, albeit\ninteresting.\n4.1. HD 51106\n\nThe light curve of this object is convincingly characteristic of\nan ellipsoidal binary, with a periodic signal at half the orbital\nperiod, plus a smaller signal at the orbital period. The CoRoT\nobservation confirms to good accuracy (superior to 10\u22124 ) the orbital period obtained from the ground (Table 2). The main period\nof two days is caused by the deformation of the stars into an ellipsoidal shape, caused by tidal effects.\n\n\f6\n\nN. Dolez et al.: HD 51106 and HD 50747: an ellipsoidal binary and a triple system observed with CoRoT.\n\nThe amplitude of the variation provides insight to the star\ndeformation: since the luminosity variation is around 0.3%, the\nstar must be stretched by at least 0.3%, a value that is modulated\nby the orbit inclination. Since the binary is non-eclipsing, it is\ndifficult to determine this inclination.\nThe 4-day period is linked to a slight asymmetry in the ellipsoids, produced for example by the heating of the two hemispheres of the stars which are in front of each other. We can assume that the rotation of the stars is synchronized with the orbital\nperiod, which is compatible with the rotation velocity obtained\nin Sect. 2.5. As can be seen in Fig. 6, this period affects the odd\nand even minima of the curve, which is natural for the heating\nprocess, but also the odd and even maxima. This means that the\nasymmetry is also caused by a luminosity difference between the\nforward and backward hemispheres of the stars, which is usually related to the O'Connell effect (O'Connell 1951, Davidge\n& Milone 1984).\nHowever, the curve is also very similar to that of a chemically peculiar star with an irregular chemical composition at\nthe surface (as for example HD 50773, see Luftinger et al., this\nissue). From what is known about HD 51106, we can probably\nexclude this hypothesis: the star is classified as an Am star,\nas confirmed by the analysis of its abundances using FEROS,\nSOPHIE, and FOCES spectra. Since Am stars are not known to\nhave measurable magnetic fields, our star is unlikely to exhibit\nmagnetic spots or noticeable chemical inhomogeneities at its\nsurface.\n\n4.2. HD 50747\n\nFor this star system, the situation is more exciting because we\nare clearly dealing with a pulsating variable star. Since it is in a\ntriple system, and the physical parameters of two of the stars are\nbadly determined, the basic questions are:\n1. which of the stars is a variable?\n2. what type of variable is it?\nWe could even investigate the possibility of there being two\nvariable stars in the system. The variability is dominated by two\nfrequencies, (F1 and F2). As we also detected two frequencies\nthat are the sum and differences of F2 and F1, this indicates that\nF1 and F2 belong to the same star, and weakens the likehood that\nthere are two variable stars in the system.\nThe brightest component is also probably not a pulsator, because it clearly falls outside any known variability regions in the\nHR diagram, but is instead situated outside the blue edge of the\n\u03b4-Scuti instability domain.\nWe can clearly exclude the hypothesis that the star is a hot\nvariable (e.g., SPB), because the luminosity indicates that the\nstars in the close orbit are cooler than the component in rapid\nrotation. On the basis of the mass derived from the orbit analysis and the range of frequencies present in the power spectrum,\nthe most likely hypothesis is a \u03b3-Doradus star. Among all the\nvariable stars of this particular class, we know that a large proportion belong to binary systems (Mathias et al. 2004; Henry et\nal. 2007).\nIn the case of HD 50747, the best candidate variable is the\nmore massive of the two close components: this latest assumption is based on the probable mass of the star (Table 3), somewhat heavier than the Sun, whereas the other component seems\nto be lighter. Of course, if the value of sin i is small enough,\n\nthe lighter component could have a mass in the right range to\nbe unstable. It is unfortunately difficult to determine the fundamental parameters of the two close components accurately\nfrom the composite spectrum. From examination of the spectra\nof HD 50747, it appears that this lighter component is very faint\n(its lines are scarcely visible), and it is unlikely to be hot enough\nto be in the instability strip.\n\n5. Conclusion\nWe have analysed observations of HD 51106 and HD 50747 acquired by CoRoT during its initial run. To interpret these data,\nwe also employed the analysis of pre-CoRoT observations, obtained from the FEROS (ESO observatory), SOPHIE (HauteProvence observatory), and FOCES (Calar Alto Astronomical\nObservatory) spectrographs: from this data we discovered that\nHD 51106 is a binary system consisting of two Am stars, and\nHD 50747 is a triple system with two close components.\nThe light curve of HD 51106 shows no indication of intrinsic variation of the stars, because the observed quasi-sinusoidal\nvariation can be attributed entirely to the orbital motion of the\nbinary. HD 51106 is a very classical case of an Am star: most\nAm stars are in binary systems, the abundances anomalies being explained by the deceleration in the rotation caused by tidal\neffects. The usual view is that diffusion produces a settling of\nhelium and prevents the excitation of pulsations (Vauclair et al.,\n1974). Despite this phenomenon, several pulsating classical Am\nstars have been discovered (Kurtz 2000, Li 2000, Henry & Fekel\n2005). Even with its improved detection by CoRoT, HD 51106\nremains, however, similar to the majority of non-pulsating Am\nstars.\nOur analysis of the spectra of HD 50747 has demonstrated\nthat it is a triple system, with two close components orbiting in\n9.25 days and a third star dominating the luminosity. The light\ncurve provides evidence of many frequencies between a few\nhours and one day. The most likely present interpretation is that\none star in the system is a variable, the most probable candidate\nbeing the more massive of the two close components: its characteristics, although not determined precisely, and the range of\nfrequencies observed are compatible with those of a \u03b3-Doradus\nstar.\nAcknowledgements.
