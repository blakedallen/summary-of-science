Both superbursters and soft X-ray transients probe the process of deep crustal heating in compact stars. It was recently shown that the\ntransfer of matter from crust to core in a strange star can heat the crust and ignite superbursts provided certain constraints on the strange quark\nmatter equation of state are fulfilled.\nAims. We derive corresponding constraints on the equation of state for soft X-ray transients assuming their quiescent emission is powered in\nthe same way, and further discuss the time dependence of this heating mechanism in transient systems.\nMethods. We approach this using a simple parametrized model for deep crustal heating in strange stars assuming slow neutrino cooling in the\ncore and blackbody photon emission from the surface.\nResults. The constraints derived for hot frequently accreting soft X-ray transients are always consistent with those for superbursters. The\ncolder sources are consistent for low values of the quark matter binding energy, heat conductivity and neutrino emissivity. The heating\nmechanism is very time dependent which may help explain cold sources with long recurrence times. Thus deep crustal heating in strange stars\ncan provide a consistent explanation for superbursters and soft X-ray transients.\n\nKey words.

Introduction\n\nerations for the quiescent emission from soft X-ray transients;\ntwo of the most important LMXB activities.\n\nStrange stars are a class of compact stars made entirely of\nabsolutely stable strange quark matter except for a possible\nthin crust of ordinary nuclear matter below the neutron drip\ndensity separated from the core by a strong Coulomb barrier\n(Itoh 1970; Baym & Chin 1976; Witten 1984; Haensel et al.\n1986; Alcock et al. 1986). The stability of strange quark matter depends on poorly constrained strong interaction properties and remains to be decided by observation or experiment\n(see Madsen (1999); Weber (2005); Weber et al. (2006) for reviews). If true, the strange matter hypothesis would imply that\nall compact stars are likely to be strange stars (because the\ngalactic flux of quark matter lumps from strange star collisions\nwill trigger the hadron-to-quark transition in neutron stars and\nsupernova cores (Madsen 1988; Caldwell & Friedman 1991)),\nand so strange star models should be able to reproduce observed characteristics of compact stars. Specifically strange\nstars should be able to reproduce the bursting behavior of low\nmass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) expected to contain some of\nthe heaviest compact stars due to accretion, and here we test\nthe consistency of the recent model for superburst ignition in\nstrange stars by Page & Cumming (2005) with similar consid-\n\nSuperbursts, first discovered by Cornelisse et al. (2000),\nare a rare kind of type I X-ray bursts from LMXBs distinguishing themselves by extreme energies (\u223c 1042 erg),\nlong durations (4\u201314 hours) and long recurrence times (\u223c 1\nyear) \u2013 see Kuulkers (2004) for a recent review of their observational properties. The mechanism behind superbursts is\nthought to be unstable thermonuclear burning of carbon in\nthe crust at densities around 109 g cm\u22123 (Cumming & Bildsten\n2001; Strohmayer & Brown 2002; Cumming & Macbeth 2004;\nBrown 2004; in't Zand et al. 2004; Cooper & Narayan 2005;\nCumming et al. 2005). The fuel for such an event is provided\nby the burning of accreted hydrogen and helium at the surface,\nwhich may take place either stably or unstably. In the latter case\nit gives rise to ordinary type I X-ray bursts. The ashes from\nthis process, containing about 10% carbon by mass, are compressed under the increasing weight of the layers above, and\nwhen enough carbon has been accumulated it may be ignited\nand burn unstably. Observed superburst light curves require the\nignition to take place at temperatures around 6 \u00d7 108 K and\ncolumn depths of approximately 1012 g cm\u22122 , and as the heat\nreleased by accretion and burning at the surface is quickly rera-\n\n\f2\n\nM. Stejner and J. Madsen: Deep crustal heating of strange stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients\n\ndiated and does not penetrate to this depth, these ignition conditions must be set by the process of deep crustal heating and\ntherefore probe the physics of the deep crust and core (Brown\n2004; Cooper & Narayan 2005).\nIn neutron stars deep crustal heating refers to the heat released as the sinking ashes undergo electron captures and most\nimportantly \u2013 at densities above 1012 g cm\u22123 \u2013 pycnonuclear\nreactions (Haensel & Zdunik 1990, 2003; Brown et al. 1998).\nThis amounts to about 1.4 MeV per nucleon and heats the core\nto \u223c 108 K depending on the accretion rate. It has however been\ndifficult to achieve superburst ignition at the appropriate column depth, and in a recent investigation Cumming et al. (2005)\nshowed that neutrino emission from Cooper pairing of neutrons\nat densities in the range 1012 \u22121013 g cm\u22123 limits the crust temperature below 5 \u00d7 108 K. Thus unstable carbon ignition seems\nimpossible at the observed depth unless Cooper pair emission\nis less efficient than currently thought or some additional heating source can be found.\nIn strange stars there can be no pycnonuclear reactions because the crust density is limited by the neutron drip density,\nbut for the same reason there can be no Cooper pair emission\nfrom neutrons either. Furthermore the energy released by matter tunneling through the Coulomb barrier at the base of the\ncrust and converting to quark matter could be much greater\nthan that released by pycnonuclear reactions in neutron stars.\nThus it seems reasonable to expect that strange stars in LMXBs\ncan be heated to higher temperatures than neutron stars, and\nPage & Cumming (2005) recently showed that this can lead\nto superburst ignition at the observed column depths if certain\nconstraints on the strange quark matter core parameters are fulfilled.\nSoft X-ray transients are LMXBs which undergo accretion\noutbursts lasting days to years separated by long periods of quiescence in which no or very little accretion takes place and\nthe X-ray luminosity drops to \u223c 1032 erg s\u22121 (Campana et al.\n1998; Rutledge et al. 1999; Tomsick et al. 2004). When accretion stops, the heat deposited at the surface quickly radiates away, and so in the absence of any residual accretion\nthe surface temperature should reflect the temperature of the\ncore including the effects of deep crustal heating. This has\nbeen thoroughly investigated for neutron stars in the literature\n(Brown et al. 1998; Ushomirsky & Rutledge 2001; Colpi et al.\n2001; Brown et al. 2002; Rutledge et al. 2002a; Yakovlev et al.\n2003, 2004, and references therein) establishing deep crustal\nheating as an unavoidable heating mechanism in the core,\nwhich should at least provide a \"rock bottom\" luminosity for\nthese sources. Residual accretion may still play a role however\n\u2013 indeed the power law components in the spectra of many of\nthese sources are often taken as a sign of residual accretion or\nshock emission from a rotation powered pulsar \u2013 and furthermore the properties of the core remains uncertain, so the precise\nnature of the quiescent emission is not firmly established.\nConsidering the many possible phases and poorly constrained properties of strange quark matter one would expect \u2013\nfor the same general reasons they were able to fit superbursters\n\u2013 that a wide range of strange star models can reproduce the\nobserved properties of soft X-ray transients. Our approach is\ntherefore to use a simple parametrized model for deep crustal\n\nheating in strange stars to discuss the consistency between constraints on strange quark matter derived from superbursters and\nsoft X-ray transients, as such a mutual fit is likely to constrain\nthe strange quark matter equation of state further.\nWe describe the overall structure of strange stars and their\ncrusts in Sect. 2 and then turn to deep crustal heating in Sect. 3.\nIn Sect. 4 we compare models with different assumptions about\nthe cooling mechanism to observations of soft X-ray transients,\nand we discuss the importance of time dependence in Sect. 5\nbefore concluding in Sect. 6.\n\n2. Strange stars and their crusts\nIf strange stars are stable they contain roughly equal numbers of up, down and strange quarks in their core, but due\nto the higher mass of the negative s-quark, these will normally be slightly disfavored giving the core an overall positive quark charge to be compensated by electrons. Even colorflavor locked strange quark matter, which is strictly charge neutral in bulk (Rajagopal & Wilczek 2001) has an overall positive\nquark charge due to surface effects (Madsen 2000, 2001; Usov\n2004). Because strange quark matter is self bound the density is\nlargely constant in the core dropping by only a factor of a few\nfrom the center to the surface, where it goes from above nuclear density to zero within a few fm \u2013 see e.g. Alcock et al.\n(1986); Haensel et al. (1986); Glendenning & Weber (1992);\nKettner et al. (1995); Weber (1999); Glendenning (2000);\nZdunik et al. (2001); Zdunik (2002) for details on the global\nproperties of strange stars. Since the electrostatic force is much\nweaker than the strong force confining the quarks, some of\nthe electrons necessary to create an overall charge neutral object will form a thin atmosphere outside the quark phase held\nin place by a huge electric field. The electric field \u2013 up to\n1018 V cm\u22121 \u2013 is capable of sustaining a nuclear matter crust\ndecoupled from the quark phase by a small electron filled\ngap (Alcock et al. 1986; Kettner et al. 1995; Stejner & Madsen\n2005). The crust is electrically neutral in bulk however, so beyond the boundary layer its structure is given by hydrostatic\nequilibrium with an equation of state corresponding to the\nchemical composition of the ashes from the surface burning\n(Glendenning & Weber 1992; Zdunik et al. 2001). The crust\nmass roughly follows (Zdunik et al. 2001)\n!\n2GM\n4\u03c0R4 Pb\n1\u2212\n(1)\nMC =\nGM\nRc2\n!\u03b3 \"\n#\nR4\nM\u2217\n\u22125 6 \u03c1b\n1 \u2212 0.295\nM\u2299\n(2)\n= 8.1 \u00d7 10\nM\u2217 \u03c1D\nR6\nwhere Pb is the pressure at the bottom of the crust, M\u2217 = M/M\u2299\nis the stellar mass in units of the solar mass, R6 = R/10 km is\nthe stellar radius, \u03c1b is the density at the bottom of the crust,\n\u03c1D = 7.8 \u00d7 1011 g cm\u22123 is the neutron drip density, \u03b3 \u2243 4/3 is\nthe adiabatic index in the crust and the last equality assumes the\ncrust composition found by Haensel & Zdunik (2003) for accreting neutron stars. The density at the bottom of the crust may\nbe limited by the neutron drip density if the Coulomb barrier\nfrom the core is sufficiently high, which depends on the details\nof the equation of state of strange quark matter. In most cases\n\n\fM. Stejner and J. Madsen: Deep crustal heating of strange stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients\n\nthis will not be possible though and the maximum crust density\nis then determined by the rate at which ions tunnel through the\nCoulomb barrier such that the tunneling rate for an accreting\nstar is equal to the accretion rate or corresponds to the inverse\nstellar age if the star is isolated (see Stejner & Madsen (2005)\nfor a detailed discussion). The tunneling rate close to this equilibrium is very sensitive to the crust density so there is no great\ndifference between these two cases in terms of crust density,\nbut for the same reason one may expect that in soft X-ray transients the tunneling rate will vary with the accretion rate \u2013 we\nreturn to this point in Sect. 5.\nSince the crust has no significant heating sources of its own\n(electron captures in the crust amount to less than 40 keV per\nnucleon (Haensel & Zdunik 2003)) its thermal profile is set by\nthe diffusion of heat from the core towards the surface. The\nsurface temperature, T S , is therefore only a function of the core\nsurface temperature, T i , and thus probes the process of deep\ncrustal heating. A detailed account for such T S \u2212 T i relations\ncan be found in e.g. Yakovlev et al. (2004), but in a reasonable approximation T i,9 \u2243 0.1T S2,6 (Gudmundsson et al. 1983),\nwhich will be sufficient for our purpose. Here T S,6 = T S /106\nK and T i,9 = T i /109 K is actually the temperature at a density of 1010 g cm\u22123 , but as the crust is largely isothermal at\nthis depth, one can take this to be the core surface temperature\n(Gudmundsson et al. 1983; Yakovlev et al. 2004).\nIn the discussion above and in what follows we have assumed the conventional description of strange stars with a\nsharp core surface, an electron filled gap and a nuclear crust.\nIt should be mentioned however that Jaikumar et al. (2006) recently showed, that if the surface tension of strange quark matter is not too high, it may be unstable to phase separation at\nlow pressure leading to a crust of quark nuggets embedded in a\ndegenerate electron gas, which would in many ways resemble\nthe nuclear crust on neutron stars. The consequences of such\na crust in an accreting system are not clear at present, and we\nrestrict ourselves to the traditional scenario.\n\n3. Deep crustal heating in accreting strange stars\nDeep crustal heating in strange stars was recently studied\nby Page & Cumming (2005) as a means of achieving superburst ignition conditions at the appropriate column depth\nand thus constrain the properties of strange quark matter\n(see also the work on continuously accreting strange stars by\nMiralda-Escude et al. (1990)). It was shown that observed ignition conditions are achieved for a wide range of crust density,\n\u03c1b , strange quark matter binding energy, QSQM , neutrino emissivity, \u01eb\u03bd , and thermal conductivity, K, provided that the direct\nUrca process does not operate in the core implying that strange\nquark matter should be a color superconductor. Furthermore\na set of useful analytical approximations to the core surface\ntemperature were shown to reasonably approximate numerical\ncalculations. Here we will use those same approximations to\nfind the corresponding constraints on strange quark matter in\nsoft X-ray transients and a relationship between the observable\nparameters of superbursters and soft X-ray transients. For clarity and to emphasize the approximations we therefore briefly\n\n3\n\nreview the calculation by Page & Cumming (2005) in the following subsection.\n\n3.1. Approximate thermal structure\nAs accretion on the strange star drives the crust towards its\nmaximum density, the rate at which nuclei (or neutrons if\nthe neutron drip density can be reached) tunnel through the\nCoulomb barrier into the quark matter core will increase until an equilibrium crust density is reached. This density may\nvary as a function of the unknown Coulomb barrier height at\nthe quark matter surface but this would not change the qualitative features of the model and for our purpose we will assume\nthat the equilibrium crust density is \u223c 1011 g cm\u22123 . As the nuclei cross into the strange quark matter core at the rate \u1e41 (in\nunits of nucleons cm\u22122 s\u22121 unless otherwise stated) and are dissolved, they release an energy, QSQM \u2264 100 MeV per nucleon\n(the actual value depends on uncertain values for strong interaction parameters but is fixed if these parameters were known).\nThis heats the core until an equilibrium or steady state temperature is reached as the heating balances energy loss by neutrino\nemission in the core. This is assumed to take place at a (slow)\nrate of\n\u01eb\u03bd \u2243 Q\u03bd \u00d7 T 98 erg cm\u22123 s\u22121 ,\n\nQ\u03bd \u223c 1018 \u2212 1022\n\n(3)\n\nwith T 9\n=\nT/109 K, corresponding to modified\nUrca and bremsstrahlung processes (Page et al. 2005;\nYakovlev & Pethick 2004). We thus neglect a slow dependence\non density in Q\u03bd which would only amount to a factor of order\nunity since the core density is nearly constant.\nWe will \u2013 at first \u2013 assume that this equilibrium is simply\ndetermined by the average accretion rate, which would be reasonable in systems where the tunneling is more or less continuous. We return to this point in section 5 however as this steady\nstate assumption may not be sufficient for all systems.\nFollowing Page & Cumming (2005) we model the thermal\nprofile of the core in a plane parallel approximation with heat\ntransport taking place by conduction and with a heat sink from\nneutrino emission. The inward directed heat flux from the conversion of nucleons to strange quark matter, F, is determined\nby\n\u03c1\n\ndF\n= \u2212\u01eb\u03bd ,\ndy\n\nF = \u2212\u03c1K\n\ndT\ndy\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the density, K is the thermal conductivity of strange\nquark matter, assumed to lie the range 1019 \u2212 1022 cgs, and y is\nthe column density. Again we will neglect slow dependencies\nof K on density and temperature so assuming that \u03c1, Q\u03bd and K\nare constant in the core this gives\nT = a(y + b)(\u22122/7)\n\na=\n\nQ\u03bd\n7 7 1\n9\n8\n2 9 (10 ) \u03c12 K\n\n!\u22121/7\n\n(5)\n\nwhere b is a constant of integration determined by the requirement that all heat\nentering the core is emitted as neutrinos,\nR\n\u1e41QSQM = \u03c1\u22121 \u01eb\u03bd dy. Assuming that the integral is dominated\n\n\f4\n\nM. Stejner and J.

Constraints on the core parameters\n(7)\n\nwhere R6 is the core radius in units of 10 km. Equating\nthis to Eq.

(6) and (7) are certainly oversimplified they were shown by Page & Cumming\n(2005) to agree reasonably well with numerical calculations of\na full general relativistic model. Furthermore they offer a physical transparency, which given the many poorly constrained\nproperties of strange quark matter, is perhaps just as desirable\nin what follows as full numerical models. Specifically Eqs. (6)\nand (7) are general enough not to depend on the properties of a\nparticular strange quark matter phase \u2013 except for the assumption of slow neutrino emissivity necessary to obtain superburst\nignition. They are in fact general enough to also describe neutron stars at the same level of detail, and indeed Eq. (7) corresponds entirely to case (ii.a) in Yakovlev et al. (2003) for lowmass neutron stars with slow neutrino emission. Thus much of\nwhat follows would also apply for neutron stars \u2013 although in\nthat case it has of course been done in much greater detail.\nIn deriving Eqs. (6) and (7) we assumed that cooling by\nneutrino emission dominated photon emission from the surface. This is certainly the case in superbursters, where the\ncore is very hot, but for cold enough cores this may not be\nthe case and one should take the surface luminosity into account. Approximating the surface with a blackbody we can estimate when this becomes important by setting, 4\u03c0R2 \u1e41QSQM =\n4\u03c0R2 \u03c3T S4 , which using the Gudmundsson et al. (1983) relation,\n2\n, gives a core temperature\nT i,9 \u2243 0.1T S,6\nT i,9 = 20\n\nof core parameters photon emission may therefore be important\nin soft X-ray transients with the lowest accretion rates as low\nas a few times 10\u221212 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\n\n(8)\n\nEquating this to Eq. (7) shows that cooling by photon emission\nbecomes important in the isothermal case below an accretion\nrate of\n!\nQSQM \u22121 \u22121/3\nR6 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (9)\n\u1e41 = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u221213 Q\u22121/3\n\u03bd,21 100 MeV\nwith a similar expression giving a somewhat lower limit for a\nnon-isothermal core. Similar conclusions for neutron stars were\nreached by Yakovlev et al. (2003). Given the right combination\n\nEqs. (6) and (7) relate quark matter properties represented by\nQ\u03bd , QSQM and K to the stellar accretion rate and core surface temperature under the assumption that the accretion rate\nis high enough for neutrino cooling to dominate. In case there\nare independent constraints on the core surface temperature\nand the accretion rate Eqs. (6) and (7) can also be regarded as\nnecessary relations between the quark matter core parameters\nQ\u03bd , QSQM and K. This approach was taken for superbursts in\nPage & Cumming (2005) assuming that the crust below the superburst ignition depth is approximately isothermal so the core\nsurface temperature can be approximated by the superburst ignition temperature, T i,9 \u2243 0.7 at \u1e41 = 0.1 \u2212 0.3 \u1e41Edd. We will\nmake the same assumption and take over the superburst parameter constraints from Page & Cumming (2005).\nAssuming that soft X-ray transients are also powered by\ndeep crustal heating, a different independent constraint on the\nquark core parameters can be obtained by applying Eqs. (6)\nand (7) to observations of the accretion rate and surface temperature of soft X-ray transients using a T S \u2212T i relation such as the\none in Yakovlev et al. (2004) or Gudmundsson et al. (1983).\nAql X-1 is an example of a well studied soft X-ray transient\nwhich has h\u1e41i \u2243 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , T S\u221e \u2243 113 eV (Yakovlev et al.\n2003; Rutledge et al. 2002a) and therefore T i,9 \u2243 0.3 using a\ncanonical mass-radius relationship, R = 10 km, M/R = 0.2,\nand T S = T S\u221e /(1 \u2212 2GM/R)1/2. The relations between the quark\nmatter core parameters thus obtained for superbursts and for\nthe soft X-ray transient Aql X-1 are compared in Fig. 1. If we\nkeep Q\u03bd fixed and increase QSQM then K must also increase to\nproduce the required temperature until the critical conductivity is reached and the star must be isothermal. Therefore only\nthe regions below the isothermal curves contain possible solutions for each class of object and there can be no common solution for superbursters and Aql X-1 between the two isothermal curves shown. It is clear that the range of quark matter\nparameters permitted for the soft X-ray transient Aql X-1 is\nsignificantly smaller than that allowed by the superbursters; in\nparticular the quark matter binding energy per baryon, QSQM ,\nnecessary to fit the soft X-ray transient must be in the lower part\nof the range allowed for fitting superbursters, other parameters\nbeing equal. We further note that the non-isothermal relations\nfrom Eq. (6) agree remarkably well in the range where common\nparameters fit superbursters and Aql X-1, whereas no simulta-\n\n\fM. Stejner and J. Madsen: Deep crustal heating of strange stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients\n\nneous isothermal solutions for the two classes of objects seem\nto exist.\n\nFig. 1. Constraints on quark core parameters obtained from\nsuperbursters (solid) and the soft X-ray transient Aql X-1\n(dashed) assuming slow neutrino cooling for both. QSQM is\ngiven as a function of Q\u03bd for different choices of K. Thin\nlines show non-isothermal constraints from Eq. (6) with K =\n1019 , 1020 , 1021 , 1022 cgs from the bottom up. Non-isothermal\nconstraints for Aql X-1 are nearly indistinguishable from those\nfor superbursters. Thick lines show isothermal constraints from\nEq. (7). We take \u1e41 = 0.3\u1e41Edd for the superbursters.\nFor a fixed (albeit unknown) set of strong interaction parameters neither the quark matter binding energy QSQM , nor\nthe quark core surface density should vary between stars, because both are given directly by the strong interaction parameters. The neutrino luminosity is dominated by the core surface\ncontribution and strange stars are furthermore characterized by\nan almost constant density in the core unless we are very close\nto the maximum mass strange star, so the slow variations with\ndensity of Q\u03bd and K should be unimportant. K may be inversely\nproportional to the temperature (Haensel 1991) and can therefore vary by a small factor between the coldest soft X-ray transients with quark core temperature \u223c 108 K and superbursters\nwith core temperature \u223c 7 \u00d7 108 K. If no density thresholds between phases or emission mechanisms are crossed when going\nfrom superbursters to soft X-ray transients it should therefore\nbe reasonable to expect approximate agreement between the relations in Fig. 1, as seen for the non-isothermal solutions, but\nnot order of magnitude differences as found in the isothermal\ncase.\n\n3.3. Scaling relations for the surface temperature\nIn this subsection we will use Eqs. (6) and (7) to relate the\nparameters for strange stars with deep crustal heating that can\nfit soft X-ray transient data and superbursters simultaneously,\nassuming slow neutrino cooling to be the dominant cooling\nmechanism. In particular we will derive relations between surface temperature and accretion rate for soft X-ray transients for\nstrange star model parameters that fit superbursts. These rela-\n\n5\n\ntions will then be compared to observational data for soft X-ray\ntransients in the following Section.\nTo the extent that QSQM and Q\u03bd do not vary between stars\nwe can utilize Eqs. (6) and (7) to compare the other parameters\nfor two arbitrary strange stars with deep crustal heating. In the\nfollowing we shall in particular be interested in cases where\none of the stars is a superburster (SB) and the other a soft Xray transient (X). From Eq.

This would translate into a temperature\ncorrection of about one percent which is far below the observational uncertainty so we can use the accretion rates in the\nliterature even though they are derived for neutron stars.

The (KSB /K)1/18\nterm can give a factor \u223c 0.9 if K depends on the temperature\nand \u03b1SB . 0.2 so we keep both of these terms but note that\nuncertainties in these parameters are strongly suppressed too.\n\n4. Comparison with observations\nThe observational sample most commonly used to test relations for deep crustal heating such as Eqs. (14) and (12) consists of soft X-ray transients in the field with short outburst\ndurations and recurrence times, for which X-ray observations\nin quiescense have determined or limited the surface temperature. The outburst duration should be short so the crust has not\nbeen significantly heated by the release of nuclear energy from\nthe accreted matter and the surface temperature is therefore set\nby deep crustal heating. The recurrence time should be short\nenough that at least a few outbursts have been observed allowing a reasonable estimate of the time averaged accretion rate\n\u2013 although one should remember that the last 37 years of Xray observations are not necessarily representative of the \u223c 104\nyears of accretion history needed to reach thermal equilibrium.\nSimilarly since the accretion history for stars in globular clusters is uncertain one should only use systems in the field.\nUseful lists of such systems and their properties including references can be found in e.g. Yakovlev et al. (2003) and\nTomsick et al. (2004). We will take this data, summarized in\nTable 1, as our observational basis and briefly discuss each system below. The best examples of such systems are Aql X-1,\nCen X-4 and 4U 1608-522 being short outburst field soft X-ray\ntransients with detected thermal components. Tomsick et al.\n(2004) discuss the outburst history of these sources and we cite\ntheir accretion rates which are based on the review of soft X-ray\ntransient activity by Chen et al. (1997) using\nh\u1e41i =\n\nL\u0304Peak Nto f\n\u01ebc2 (33 yr)\n\n(18)\n\nwhere L\u0304Peak is the time averaged peak outburst luminosity, N\nis the number of outbursts, f = 0.4 is a factor which accounts\nfor the shape of the light curve, \u01eb = 0.2 is the fraction of rest\nmass energy released during the accretion and the time average\nis taken over 33 years of observation. Aql X-1, Cen X-4 and\n4U 1608-522 have gone though 21, 2 and 16 outburst respectively between 1969 and 2003 allowing estimates of the accretion rate. Temperatures are found from spectral fits to absorbed\nneutron star atmosphere models assuming a mass of 1.4 M\u2299 \u2013\nthis also yields the best fit radius cited. Cen X-4 and some observations of Aql X-1 further require a power law component\npossibly indicating residual accretion during quiescense.\nFor SAX J1808.4-3658, SAX J1810.8-2609 and XTE\nJ2123-058 no thermal components have been detected and so\nwe only cite upper limits to the surface temperature. SAX\nJ1810.8-2609 and XTE J2123-058 have each shown only one\noutburst so the accretion rate is actually an upper limit. The accretion rate cited for SAX J1808.4-3658 is based on the two\noutbursts in 1996 and 1998, but further outburst have ocurred\nin 2000, 2002 and 2005 (see Wijnands (2004) for a review).\nThese systems are therefore not expected to agree well with\nthe theory, but at least the upper limits to their surface temperatures should not lie significantly below the prediction of deep\ncrustal heating if they have accreted for long enough to have\nreached thermal equilibrium.\nXTE J1709-267 lies 9-10 arcmin from NGC 6293 which\nhas a tidal radius of 14.2 arcmin and so may be associated with\nthis globular cluster although distance measurements are inconclusive on this (Jonker et al. 2004). It has shown two outbursts\nsince 1995 and has a varying power law component.\nAs should be clear from the discussion above the data is\nrather uncertain and should be treated with some caution. In\nparticular the time averaged accretion rates are hardly more\nthan estimates, and the surface temperatures, when they can be\nfound, are uncertain and may not only reflect deep crustal heating. Nevertheless deep crustal heating should provide a minimum temperature for systems that have accreted long enough\nand so we should at least test for consistency with the observations if not perfect agreement. In Fig. 2 we plot the data from\nTable 1 and compare with photon cooling curves as well as\nEqs. (12), (14) and (16), that assume neutrino cooling, for values of \u03b1SB corresponding to \u1e41SB = 0.1 and 0.3 \u1e41Edd.\nThe overall agreement with our predictions from neutrino\nemission in superbursts is not impressive. Except Aql X-1 and\n4U 1608-522 the observations fall significantly below the predicted temperature for neutrino cooling, and actually pure photon cooling does better if QSQM . 1 MeV although it should\nnot be dominant for the high accretion rates in Aql X-1 and 4U\n1608-522. This raises two issues.\nFirst it is noteworthy that the two sources which fall close\nto the superburst prediction without photon cooling, are the\nhottest and most frequently accreting sources thus resembling\nsuperbursters the most. In turn this raises the question whether\nthe accretion history may lead to heating with a pronounced\ntime dependence and whether the time averaged accretion rate\nis then still a good predictor for the temperature \u2013 we discuss\nthis possibility in the next section.\n\n\fM.

Thus we now\ndemand \u2013 similarly to the procedure in Yakovlev et al. (2003)\n\u2013 LDH = 4\u03c0R2 \u1e41QSQM = L\u03b3 + L\u03bd where LDH is the luminosity required to carry away the energy released by deep crustal\nheating and L\u03b3 = 4\u03c0R2 \u03c3T S4 is the usual blackbody luminosity. Following the calculation that leads to Eq. (6) the nonisothermal neutrino luminosity is\nT i,9\nL\u03bd = 4\u03c0R * 0.3 \u1e41Edd * 100 MeV *\n0.87\n2\n\n!9/2\n\n1/2\nQ1/2\n\u03bd,21 K20 .

We see that photon cooling\ndominates at low accretion rates and low QSQM whereas for\nhigh accretion rates and QSQM we recover the neutrino cooling curves relevant to superbursters. In particular we note that\nQSQM = 0.4 MeV while still fulfilling the superburst requirements at high accretion rates provides a close fit to some of\nthe sources at low accretion rates that were difficult to explain\nwith neutrino cooling alone. In this case other processes must\nbe heating the surfaces of Aql X-1 and 4U 1608-522 though.\nBrown et al. (1998) similarly found that deep crustal heating of neutron stars could explain the quiescent emission from\nCen X-4 if only 0.1 MeV of the energy released by pycnonuclear reactions during an outburst was conducted into the core\nand deposited there. Yakovlev et al. (2003, 2004) instead interpreted Cen X-4 and SAX J1808.4-3658 as massive neutron\nstars with enhanced neutrino emission. In the context of strange\nstars the energy is deposited directly in the core, but no enhanced neutrino cooling is required if the quark matter binding\nenergy QSQM is small.\n\n\f8\n\nM.

Left: comparing combined photon and neutrino cooling of an isothermal core (solid; cf. Eq. (22)) to the observations in\nTable 1 with QSQM as labelled for each curve . For reference we also show curves with neutrino cooling only (dashed; cf. Eq. (14))\nand photon cooling only (dotted). The curves assuming QSQM = 100 MeV and neutrino cooling only are nearly identical. For\nCen X-4 the quoted temperature intervals overlap. Right: corresponding curves for a non-isothermal core.\n\n5. Time dependence of the mass transfer rate\nThe quiescent luminosity from some of the sources discussed here (i.e. Aql X-1 (Rutledge et al. 2002a), and Cen\nX-4 (van Paradijs et al. 1987; Campana et al. 1997, 2004;\nRutledge et al. 2001)) have been found to vary by factors of a\nfew on timescales of days to years raising the question of how\ntime dependent the heating mechanism is following an outburst. Furthermore the time dependence of the heating mechanism may be important in sources with long recurrence times\nand help explain their relatively low temperatures reducing the\nneed to keep QSQM small.\nTo fully demonstrate either of these points would require a\ndetailed time dependent model for cooling strange stars, which\nis beyond our scope here. Thus the calculations below are concerned only with the time dependence of the tunneling rate \u2013\nand hence the heating \u2013 following an outburst, but we note that\nwith respect to its consequences for the surface temperature we\nmay be guided by similar considerations for neutron stars.\nIn neutron stars heat is released during and after an accretion event at the depth and on the time scale (months for\nthe pycnonuclear reactions) corresponding to the individual\nelectron captures, neutron emissions and pycnonuclear reactions. It then takes about 1 yr for the heat from the pycnonuclear reactions to diffuse to the surface (Brown et al. 1998;\nUshomirsky & Rutledge 2001) and since it spreads out along\nthe way, it is seen there as a heat wave lasting approximately the\nthermal diffusion time to the surface. Ushomirsky & Rutledge\n(2001) investigated the time dependence of this process for 1day long outbursts, and found that energy deposited at depths,\nwhere the diffusion time to the surface was shorter than the outburst recurrence time, could produce significant variations in\nthe surface luminosity following a pattern in time corresponding to the diffusion time for each nuclear reaction. If for instance the recurrence time was 1 year and assuming a low thermal conductivity in the crust, the luminosity variations were\na few percent of the average, and only one heat wave could\nbe seen because the diffusion time from the depth of the pyc-\n\nnonuclear reactions was on the order of the recurrence time. If\nthe recurrence time was 30 years the variations in the luminosity could be up to 30 percent for cores with standard cooling\nand a factor of 3-4 for cores with accelerated cooling (e.g. pion\ncondensates). In this case two separate heat waves were seen \u2013\none corresponding to electron captures in the outer crust visible a few days after the outburst and the other to the pycnonuclear reactions deeper in the crust emerging about a year later.\nFor higher thermal conductivity variations were larger and happened on shorter time scales.\nBy analogy if the tunneling rate at the bottom of the crust \u2013\nand hence the heating \u2013 is sufficiently time dependent following an accretion event, we would expect the qualitative conclusions in Ushomirsky & Rutledge (2001) to apply, possibly\nleading to strong variations in the surface temperature following an outburst as the resulting heat waves reach the surface.\nOne difference may be though that in strange stars the heat is\nreleased at a lower density in the crust with a shorter diffusion\ntime to the surface so the two heat waves may be closer in time.\nThe transfer of mass from crust to core by tunneling takes\nplace at a rate of (Alcock et al. 1986; Stejner & Madsen 2005)\n\ndMC\n= \u2212mN Nion \u00d7 \u03bd \u00d7 \u03c4(\u03c1b )\ndt\n= \u22124\u03c0R2d \u03c1b \u00d7 \u03bd \u00d7 \u03c4(\u03c1b )\n\u03c1b\n= \u221223.8 \u03c4(\u03c1b ) M\u2299 s\u22121\n\u03c1D\n\n(23)\n\nwhere mN is the mass of ions at the bottom of the crust, Nion\nis the number of such ions whose motion allow them to strike\nthe Coulomb barrier taken to be the number within one lattice\ndistance, d \u223c 200 fm, \u03c1b is the density at the bottom of the\ncrust, \u03bd . 1 MeV is the frequency of this motion and \u03c4(\u03c1) is the\ntransmission rate.

We plot this behaviour in Fig. 4 assuming e\u03c6e (RS ) = 20 MeV and the crust\ncomposition in Haensel & Zdunik (2003) (106 Ge at maximum\ndensity). From Eq. (23) a star accreting 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 must\nhave log \u03c4 . \u221242 in equilibrium, so as previously mentioned\nthe tunneling rate close to equilibrium is very sensitive to the\ndensity.\n\nFig. 5. A crude model of Cen X-4. Crust mass in a system accreting with 10 day long accretion outbursts separated by quiescent intervals of 30 years and an average accretion rate of\n1.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The inset shows a few equilibrium cycles.\nThe peaks seen here have a flat top which is not resolved in\ntime on the scale shown.\n\nFig. 4. Plot of Eq. (24) assuming e\u03c6e (RS ) = 20 MeV and 106 Ge\nat the crust boundary. Note that for this barrier height the gap\nwidth goes to zero and \u03c4 to 1 somewhat below the neutron drip\ndensity, which can then not be reached.\nEq. (2) gives a relation between MC and \u03c1b so we can solve\nEq. (23) to find the crust mass and tunneling rate for given accretion scenarios. Assuming the same parameters as in Fig. 4\nwe show a solution in Fig. 5 with 10 day long accretion outbursts separated by quiescent intervals of 30 years and an average accretion rate of 1.9 \u00d7 10\u221211 M\u2299 yr\u22121 \u2013 roughly corresponding to Cen X-4. We start the integration with a crust\nmass sufficiently low that the tunneling rate is negligible and\nlet it build up until the mass transferred to the core during\neach cycle matches the average accretion rate. At this point the\ncrust mass is at its maximum \u2013 as determined by the choice of\ne\u03c6e (RS ) = 20 MeV \u2013 during the accretion outbursts and then\nrelaxes to a state with very little tunneling within about a year\nafter each outburst. Fig. 6 shows the corresponding result for\na system resembling Aql X-1 accreting 10 in every 220 days\n\nFig. 6. A crude model of Aql X-1. Crust mass in a system accreting with 10 day long accretion outbursts separated by quiescent intervals of 220 days and an average accretion rate of\n10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The inset shows a few equilibrium cycles.\nThus practically all the heating takes place during and immediately after the outburst when the transfer rate is essentially\nthe accretion rate, and the heating mechanism is indeed extremely time dependent. In systems such as Aql X-1 and 4U\n1608-522 the outburst recurrence time is comparable to the\ndiffusion time to the surface however. The heat wave resulting from an accretion outburst will therefore be smeared out,\nand the crust temperature will not vary significantly between\noutbursts unless one assumes a high thermal conductivity in\nthe crust, so a steady state model using the average accretion\nrate should be able to predict the temperature. Conversely in\n\n\f10\n\nM. Stejner and J. Madsen: Deep crustal heating of strange stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients\n\nsystems such as Cen X-4 where the recurrence time is significantly longer than the diffusion time to the surface one would\nexpect larger temperature variations following an outburst.\nFurthermore in such systems the core \u2013 or the surface layers of the core in the non-isothermal case \u2013 may have time to\ncool significantly between outbursts. In this case we would not\nexpect Eqs. (12), (14) and (16) to hold, but if (speculatively)\nthe tunneling rate late in the cycle is a better predictor of the\ntemperature at this point, Eq. (12) assuming neutrino cooling\nonly would actually give a surface temperature around 76 eV\nfor Cen X-4 as observed. The same argument for XTE J1709267 assuming a 6 year recurrence time would lead to surface\ntemperatures as low as 83 eV. Here the recurrence time may\nnot be quite long enough however, and furthermore the temperature we cite was measured in May 2003 not very long after\nthe March-April 2002 outburst, so the argument may be too\nsimple. The temperature we cite for Cen X-4 was measured in\n1997-2000 long after the 1979 outburst so this should provide a\nmore clear-cut case. For the temperature of the three remaining\nsources to reach their upper bounds in this way with the cited\naccretion rates, the outburst recurrence times would have to be\nvery long (\u223c 50, 100 and 800 years for SAX J1810.8-2609,\nXTE J2123-058 and SAX J1808.4-3658 respectively).\nThis shows how the the time dependence of the heating\nmechanism may potententially help explain the coldest soft Xray transients, even if QSQM is too high for photon cooling to\ndominate. More work including details on the cooling of the\ncore and the transport properties of both crust and core would\nbe required though to show that it is possible for the temperature to change this rapidly.\n\n6. Conclusion\nUsing a simple scaling argument for the steady state temperature of accreting strange stars we have presented a consistency\ncheck between the constraints on strange quark matter derived\nfrom superburst ignition conditions, and the temperature of quiescent soft X-ray transients \u2013 both assumed to derive from deep\ncrustal heating by transfer of matter from crust to core.\nFor systems with short recurrence times where the steady\nstate temperature may be expected to be a good approximation we found reasonable agreement assuming neutrino cooling\nonly \u2013 although the range of quark matter parameters giving\nsuperbursters between the isothermal curves in Fig. 1 is then\nexcluded by soft X-ray transients. Assuming a combination of\nphoton and neutrino cooling for soft X-ray transients, we saw\nin Fig. 3 that if QSQM . 1 MeV even the coldest sources may\nbe explained while still fulfilling superburst ignition conditions\nat high accretion rates.\nWe further showed that the tunneling rate near the equilibrium crust mass depends sensitively on the crust density and\nconsequently that essentially all the heating takes place during\nor immediately after an outburst. This points to the need for\na fully time dependent model to fit systems with recurrence\ntimes significantly longer than the thermal diffusion time to\nthe surface, but if the low level tunneling rate long after the\noutburst is a better predictor for such systems, it would provide a fit for Cen X-4 assuming only neutrino cooling as well.\n\nThe upper temperature bounds on SAX J1810.8-2609, XTE\nJ2123-058 and SAX J1808.4-3658 can not be reached for the\ncited accretion rates in this way unless the recurrence times are\nvery long. This is consistent with the outburst histories of SAX\nJ1810.8-2609 and XTE J2123-058 \u2013 one known outburst each\n\u2013 but does not compare well with the \u223c 2 yr recurrence time\nfor SAX J1808.4-3658. Similarly to the situation with neutron\nstars (Campana et al. 2002; Yakovlev et al. 2004) some form\nof enhanced cooling would thus seem to be required if SAX\nJ1808.4-3658 has accreted for long enough to heat the core to\nits equilibrium temperature and QSQM is too high for photon\ncooling to dominate. XTE J1709-267 has an intermediate recurrence time, and its temperature was measured shortly after\nan outburst making interpretation difficult.\nIf \u2013 as seems reasonable \u2013 a combination of the two cooling\nmechanisms is required to explain the observations we should\nfurther note that the constraints imposed by Aql X-1 in Fig. 1\nare not relevant since they were derived assuming only neutrino\ncooling. The requirement that QSQM . 1 MeV can therefore be\nmet \u2013 even if only just \u2013 for the quoted range in Q\u03bd and K\nassuming the parameters fit superburst ignition conditions in\nFig. 1. Although such fine tuning in the binding energy can not\nbe ruled out it is rather conspicuous, but given the simplicity\nof our model and that we have not dealt with the uncertainties\nor the time dependence in detail such quantitative conclusions\nshould be treated with caution. We have attempted to test for\nconsistency, not to determine the quark matter parameters. This\nwould require more detailed modelling, possibly taking the individual accretion history of each source into account, which\nmay alleviate the need to keep QSQM small.\nThus even assuming a high QSQM the model seems consistent for the systems where it should be most credible and with\nthe exception of SAX J1808.4-3658 no clear inconsistency can\nbe demonstrated for the other sources studied here. However\nSAX J1808.4-3658 is difficult to explain with neutron stars as\nwell, and its precise nature remains to be decided. At this point\nstrange stars thus seem to do no worse than neutron stars in explaining the quiescent emission of soft X-ray transients regardless of the assumed core parameters, and for a low QSQM they\nexplain even the coldest sources including SAX J1808.4-3658.\nBecause the two cooling mechanisms are important in different\naccretion regimes it finally seems likely that detailed modelling\nalong with more accurate temperature measurements at low accretion rates would constrain the core parameters further \u2013 or\nperhaps demonstrate a clear inconsistency.\nFinally we should not omit a short discussion of the\ninteresting quasi persistent transients KS 1731-260 and\nMXB 1659-29 (Wijnands et al. 2001; Rutledge et al. 2002b;\nWijnands et al. 2002, 2003, 2004; Cackett et al. 2006). These\nare systems with prolonged accretion outbursts \u2013 12.5 and 2.5\nyears duration respectively \u2013 and a convincing case has been\nbuilt for the suggestion that their crusts are significantly heated\nduring these outbursts and brought out of thermal equilibrium\nwith the core. The thermal components in their spectrum therefore show the cooling of the crust to thermal equilibrium and\nrecently Cackett et al. (2006) using new Chandra and XMMNewton data found that both systems are now close to equilibrium allowing the core temperatures and thermal cooling time\n\n\fM. Stejner and J. Madsen: Deep crustal heating of strange stars in superbursters and soft X-ray transients\n\nscales of the crusts to be determined. Fitting the cooling curves\nwith an exponential decay towards a constant temperature presumably reflecting the core temperature the constant was found\nto be 71.3 \u00b1 1.6 eV for KS 1731-260 and 52.1 \u00b1 1.6 eV for\nMXB 1659-29 at infinity. Using a canonical mass-radius relationship this implies surface temperatures of 93.1 \u00b1 2.1 eV and\n68.0 \u00b1 2.1 eV respectively, so these sources are both cold but\nnot unusually so. Only upper limits to the accretion rates can be\nestablished with any certainty however due to the very limited\nnumber of observed outbursts. For KS 1731-260 (one outburst\nin 1988-2001) this is 5.1 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Yakovlev et al. 2003)\nusing the time-averaged flux of Rutledge et al. (2002b). For\nMXB 1659-29 Wijnands et al. (2003) find bolometric fluxes\nof 5 \u2212 10 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for the 1999-2001 outburst and\n2 \u2212 12 \u00d7 10\u221210 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 for the 1976-1979 outburst which\nusing the highest of these values in Eq. (18) (with f = 1) means\nan upper limit of 1.6 \u00d7 10\u221210 M\u2299 yr\u22121 for a distance of 10 kpc.\nReferring to Fig. 3 both of these limits are very high given\nthe surface temperatures, and would require enhanced cooling\nfor both strange stars and neutron stars \u2013 but then the accretion rates are hardly certain enough to back up such a claim.\nPerhaps more interesting the e-folding times for the crust temperature relaxing back to the core temperature were determined\nboth sources. Both of these were rather short (246 \u00b1 62 days for\nKS 1731-260 and 501 \u00b1 61 days for MXB 1656-29) and by\ncomparison with the neutron star cooling curves computed by\nRutledge et al. (2002b) for the accretion history of KS 1731260 may be taken as evidence for high thermal conductivity\nin the crust. Strange stars are missing the deep crust between\n1011 and 1015 g cm\u22123 and as we have seen there is very little\ntunnelling in quiescence, so although it would go too far to\nshow this in detail here, it should be safe to assume that they\ncool faster than neutron stars relaxing the need for high thermal conductivity in the crust. This new development therefore\nfurther underlines how rewarding a time dependent model for\naccreting strange stars might be.\nAcknowledgements.
