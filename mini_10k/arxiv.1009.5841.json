Introduction and Main Results\nIn [BZ2] Burago and Zalgaller proved the following theorem, that represents a P L version for dimension n = 2 of the celebrated Nash-Kuiper C 1\nisometric embedding theorem [Na], [Ku1]:\nTheorem 1.1. Any compact orientable P L 2-manifold admits a P L isometric embedding in R3 .\nRemark 1.2. Nonorientable P L 2-manifolds are shown to admit P L immersions into R3 .\nOf course, one has to properly define the notion of isometric embedding\nfor the case of P L manifolds. We leave this for Section 2.\nThe main purpose of this note is to examine the validity of Theorem\n1.1 above in dimensions n > 2, hence of the Nash-Kuiper-Burago-Zalgaller\nembedding process - henceforward abbreviated as N KBZ. In particular we\nprove the following negative result:\nTheorem 1.3. In any dimension n \u2265 3 there exists a compact P L manifold\n(in fact an infinity of such manifolds) that can not be P L isometrically\nembedded in Rn+1 via the NKBZ method.\nDate: November 13, 2018.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 52B70, 57R40, 53C42, 30C65.\nKey words and phrases.

In any dimension n \u2265 3 there exists a compact P L manifold (in fact an infinity of such manifolds) that admits no nontrivial quasiconformal embedding in Rn+1 .\nAgain, as in the proof of Theorem 1.3, the method to prove the result\nabove, besides an examination of the proof of Theorem 1.1, is to make appeal to the theory of quasiconformal/quasiregular mappings, more precisely\nto apply a theorem of Rickman and Srebro ([RS]) on the nonexistence of\nquasiregular mappings with large local index on a finite, evenly distributed\nset in Rn , n \u2265 3 (see Theorem 2.11 below).\nRemark 1.5. The implication of the nonexistence of such an embedding to\nGraphics, Imaging and related applicative fields was discussed in some detail\nin [Sa4].\nThe remainder of the paper is apportioned as follows: In Section 2 we\npresent the necessary background. Section 3 represents a sketch of the\nBurago-Zalgaller construction. It is followed, in Section 4, by an analysis of the obstructions to the extension of the said construction to higher\ndimensions. The main results are proven in Section 5. In the last section we\ndiscuss the role of curvature. In particular, we show that the compactness\ncondition, given in [BZ2], is too restrictive, and prove that their embedding\nresult holds, in fact, for a quite large class of unbounded manifolds (with or\nwithout boundary). We also give a P L version of the Gauss compatibility\ncondition for existence of isometric embeddings of P L 2-manifolds into R3 .\nA few precautionary words to the reader: It is possible \u2013 indeed, it is\nrather probable \u2013 that part of the material contained herein, especially in\nSection 2, will appear redundant and classical. However, since the paper\ndoes not properly appertain neither to Differential Geometry, nor to Quasiconformal/Quasiregular Function Theory, but rather lies in an indeterminate area between these two fields, we have decided to make the paper self\ncontained, hence as friendly as possible to readers of both backgrounds (and\nhopefully, of any mathematical background).\n2. Terminology, Notation and Preliminaries\n2.1. P L Isometric Embeddings. It is a quite common mistake to believe\nP L isometric embeddings coincide with the isometric embeddings in the\nclassical (smooth) Riemannian context. It is true that a (rather straightforward) Riemannian structure on P L manifolds can be defined \u2013 for full\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n3\n\ndetails see [Te]. However, due to the lack of smoothness, the classical curvature operator can not be defined, therefore the two notions of isometric\nembedding (i.e. classical and P L) diverge. Indeed, they coincide only for\npiecewise flat manifolds \u2013 see, e.g. [Be]. It is, therefore important to emphasize the difference and give the correct definition in the P L case. (See\n[Gr], [LeDo] and, for a a lengthier discussion, [Sa4]).\nDefinition 2.1. Let M n be a P L manifold (or, more generally, a metric\nspace). A map f : M n \u2192 N \u03bd , where N \u03bd is another manifold (metric space)\nis called a P L isometric embedding, or a path isometry iff\n(i) It is a topological embedding\nand\n(ii) length(f (\u03b3)) = length(\u03b3) ,\nfor all1 curves in M n .\nRemark 2.2. It is interesting to note that if one discards the embedding\nrequirement, then the following rather surprisingly result is obtained, namely\nthat any P L-manifold of dimension \u2264 4 admits an P L isometry into Rn\n([Za1]).\nFor more results on the metric geometry of P L surfaces see e.g. [Sa1],\n[SA].\n2.2. Locally Flat Manifolds. In the following we shall want to clearly distinguish between piecewise flat embeddings and simply P L ones. Therefore,\nwe bring here, following Loukkainnen [Lu], the necessary definition. First,\nwe have to introduce some notation:\nLet m 6= n be natural numbers. First, let Rn+ = {X \u2208 Rn | xn \u2265 0},\nn\nR++ = {x \u2208 Rn+ | xn\u22121 \u2265 0}, and we identify Rq with {x \u2208 Rn | xi = 0, if i \u2265\nn\nq + 1}. Next, we define: Rn,q\n+ = {x \u2208 R+ | xi = 0, if i \u2264 n \u2212 q}, and\nn,q\nn,q\nn,1\nn,1\nR++ = {x \u2208 R+ | xn\u22121 \u2265 0}. (R++ = R+ .)\nA model for locally flat manifold pair at a point of a submanifold, or\nsimply a (n, q)-model, we mean one of the following pairs:\nn,q\nn\n(i) (Rn , Rq ), (Rn , Rq+ ), (Rn+ , Rn,q\n+ ), (R+ , R++ ), if q \u2265 2;\n(ii) (Rn , R1 ), (Rn , R1+ ), (Rn+ , Rn,1\n+ ), if q = 1;\n(iii) (Rn , R0 ), (Rn+ , R0 ), if q = 0;\nDefinition 2.3. A P L submanifold M of Rn is called locally flat (LF ), or\npiecewise flat (P F ), iff for any point x \u2208 M , there exists an open neighbourhood U of x in Rn , an (n, q)-model (N, L) and a P L homeomorphism\nh : U \u2192 N , such that h(U \u2229 M ) = L, and h(x) = 0.\n2.3. Quasiregular Mappings.\nDefinition 2.4. Let D \u2286 Rn be a domain; n \u2265 2 and let f : D \u2192 Rn be a\ncontinuous mapping. f is called\n(1) quasiregular (qr) iff\n1even for those of infinite length\n\n\f4\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\n(a) is locally Lipschitz (and thus differentiable a.e.);\nand\n(b) 0 < |f \u2032 (x)|n \u2264 KJf (x), for any x \u2208 M n ;\nwhere f \u2032 (x) denotes the formal derivative of f at x, |f \u2032 (x)| = sup |f \u2032 (x)h|,\n|h| = 1\n\nand where Jf (x) = detf \u2032 (x);\n(2) quasiconformal (qc) iff f : D \u2192 f (D) is a quasiregular homeomorphism;\n\nThe smallest number K that satisfies condition (b) above is called the outer\ndilatation of f .\nRemark 2.5. One can extend the definitions above to mappings f : M n \u2192\nN n , where M n , N n are oriented, connected Riemannian n-manifolds, n \u2265 2,\nby using coordinate charts (for details see, e.g. [Va2]).\nRemark 2.6. Admittedly, the appellative quasiconformal conveys little geometric meaning. Certainly, the term mappings of bounded distortion, originally introduced by Reshetnyak [Re] is far more apt to convey the geometric\ncontent of such mappings and would, perhaps, be better used in the present\ngeometric context. However, the notions of quasiconformal and quasiregular\nmappings have gained ground, due to the fact that they clearly point to the\nfact that such mappings represent natural extensions of the classical conformal, respective analytic mappings in the plane. Because of this reason, and\ndue to the fact that core of the paper is based upon the observation that\nno \"almost conformal\", quasiconformal parametrizations of the neighborhoods of the vertices of a polyhedron are possible in dimension n \u2265 3 (see\nSection 4, (5) and Section 5), we have retained here the more established\nterminology (albeit, perhaps, at the detriment of geometric intuition).\nIf f : D \u2192 Rn is quasiregular, then there exists K \u2032 \u2265 1 such that the\nfollowing inequality holds a.e. in M n :\n(2.1)\n\nJf (x) \u2264 K \u2032 inf |Tx f h|n\n|h|=1\n\nBy analogy with the outer dilatation we have the following definition:\nDefinition 2.7. The smallest number K \u2032 that satisfies inequality (2.1) is the\ninner dilation KI (f ) of f , and K(f ) = max(KO (f ), KI (f )) is the maximal\ndilatation of f . If K(f ) < \u221e we say that f is called K-qr.\nThe dilations are K(f ), KO (f ) and KI (f ) are simultaneously finite or\nn\u22121\n(f ) and\ninfinite. Indeed, the following inequalities hold: KI (f ) \u2264 KO\nn\u22121\nKO (f ) \u2264 KI (f ). This allows us to talk about the dilatation (K) of a\nmapping, without being more specific.\nFor planar quasiregular mappings we have the following classical structure\ntheorem:\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n5\n\nTheorem 2.8 (Stoilow, [St]). Let f : D \u2192 R2 be a nonconstant quasiregular\nmapping. Then f admits the following factorization: f = g \u25e6 h, where\nh : D \u2192 R2 is quasiconformal and h : f (D) \u2192 C \u2261 R2 is a nonconstant\nholomorphic mapping.\nIn particular, any quasiregular mapping f : D \u2192 Rn is locally quasiconformally equivalent to the mapping z 7\u2192 z m , z \u2208 C, for some m = m(x0 ) \u2208\nN, x0 \u2208 D. Unfortunately, no generalization of Stoilow's Theorem result\nexists in dimension n \u2265 3. (We shall further expand upon this subject\nshortly.)\nDefinition 2.9. Let f : D \u2192 Rn be a quasiregular mapping. The set\nBf = {x \u2208 M n | f is not a local homeomorphism at x} is called the branch\nset of f .\nSince any quasiregular mapping f : M n \u2192 N n is discrete, that is f \u22121 (y)\nis discrete, for any y \u2208 M n (see [Re]), we can introduce the following\nDefinition 2.10. Let f : D \u2192 Rn be an orientation preserving map. The\nlocal topological index of f at x is defined as:\n(2.2)\n\ni(x, f ) = inf\n\nU \u2208 N (x)\n\nsup|f \u22121 (y) \u2229 U |\ny\n\nNote that if f : D \u2192 Rn is a quasiregular mapping, then i(x, f ) \u2265 1 and,\nmoreover, x \u2208 Bf iff i(x, f ) > 1.\nAlso, for n \u2265 3 the local topological index cannot be uniformly too large\non all the points of a non-degenerate continuum F . To be more precise, the\nfollowing inequality holds:\n(2.3)\n\ninf i(x, f ) < nn\u22121 KI (f ) .\n\nx\u2208F\n\n(See e.g. [Ri2], III. 5.9.)\nMoreover, even though local topological index can be arbitrarily large at\nan isolated point (see [Ri1], pp. 263-264), it can not be too large even on a\nfinite number of points if the points and the indices of the map f at these\npoints are evenly distributed:\nTheorem 2.11 ([RS], Theorem 1.1). Let f : D \u2192 Rn , D \u2286 Rn , n \u2265 3 be\na non-constant K-qr mapping. Then, for any x0 \u2208 D, there exist t0 , p > 0,\nsuch that, and for any x1 , . . . , xm \u2208 Bn [x0 , t], 0 < 0 \u2264 t0 , and satisfying the\nfollowing conditions:\n(1) |x0 \u2212 xm | = t;\n\n\u0001 1\n(2) |xj\u22121 \u2212xj | = t/p, where p0 \u2264 p \u2264 m \u2264 p\u03bd and 1 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 i(x0 , f )/KI (f ) n\u22121 ,\n\nthere exists j \u2208 {1, . . . , m} such that i(xj , f ) < i(x0 , f ). (Here Bn [x0 , t]\ndenotes the closed ball of center x0 and radius t.)\n\n\f6\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\n2.3.1. Coefficients of Quasiconformality. We bring below a few results regarding the coefficients of quasiconformality of some specific domains. In\nthis we rely on [Va2] and [Ca]. These results are needed in the proof of our\nresult.\nDefinition 2.12. Let D \u2282 Rn , D \u2243 Bn . The coefficients of quasiconformality of D are defined as follows:\n(2.4)\n\nKI (D) =\n\ninf\n\u223c\n\nf :D \u2192Bn\n\nKI (f ), KO (D) =\n\nK(D) =\n\ninf\n\u223c\n\ninf\n\u223c\n\nf :D \u2192Bn\n\nKO (f ),\n\nK(f ).\n\nf :D \u2192Bn\n\nDefinition 2.13. Let x \u2208 Rn be a point with cylindrical coordinates x =\n(r cos \u03c6, r sin \u03c6, z1 , . . . , zn\u22122 ). The set D\u03b1 = {0 < \u03c6 < \u03b1}, (0 < \u03b1 \u2264 2\u03c0)\nis called a wedge of angle \u03b1. More generally, a domain D \u2282 Rn , n \u2265 3 is\ncalled a wedge of angle \u03b1 iff there exists a similarity mapping f such that\nf (D) = D\u03b1 . f \u22121 ({r = 0}) is called the edge of D. Given a domain \u03a9, a\npoint b \u2208 \u2202\u03a9 is called a wedge point iff there exist a neighborhood U of b and\na wedge D of angle \u03b1, such that b lies on the edge of \u03a9 and U \u2229 D = U \u2229 \u03a9.\n\nDefinition 2.14. The homeomorphism f : D\u03b1 \u2192 D\u03b2 , f (r, \u03c6, z) = (r, \u03b1\u03b2 \u03c6, z),\nz = (z1 , . . . , zn\u22122 ), is called a (folding, or winding (or, more precisely, (k)winding mapping).\nWe should note that, for n \u2265 3, foldings are topologically equivalent to\nz 7\u2192 z k \u00d7 Id (where Id denotes the identity mapping of Rn\u22122 ).\nIf \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2, then f is quasiconformal, with dilatations KI (f ) = \u03b1\u03b2 , KO (f ) \u2265\n( \u03b1\u03b2 )1/(n\u22121) . In particular, for \u03b2 = \u03c0, we obtain KI (D\u03b1 ) = \u03b1\u03c0 , KO (D\u03b1 ) =\n( \u03b1\u03c0 )1/(n\u22121) , whence K(D\u03b1 ) = \u03b1\u03c0 .\nRemark 2.15. Remarkably, the coefficients of quasiconformality for nonconvex domains (i.e. \u03c0 \u2264 2\u03c0) are not known (at least to the best of our\nknowledge).\nFollowing [Ca], we note the following natural generalization of the definition of a wedge:\nDefinition 2.16. The domain D\u03b1k \u2282 Rn , D\u03b1k = {(r, \u03c61 , . . . , \u03c6n\u2212k+1 , zn\u2212k+1 , . . . , zn )}\nis called a dihedral wedge of type k and angle \u03b1.\nRemark 2.17. For k = n \u2212 2 we recuperate the classical definition of wedges.\nProposition 2.18 ([Ca]). The coefficients of quasiconformality for D\u03b1k are:\n1\n\u0012\n\u0013 n\u22121\n\u03c0 n\u2212k\u22121\n\u03c0 n\u2212k\u22121\n, KO (D\u03b1k ) \u2265\n,\n(2.5)\nKI (D\u03b1k ) =\n\u03b11 * * * \u03b1n\u2212k\u22121\n\u03b11 * * * \u03b1n\u2212k\u22121\nK(D\u03b1k ) =\n\n\u03c0 n\u2212k\u22121\n.\n\u03b11 * * * \u03b1n\u2212k\u22121\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n7\n\nCorollary 2.19. Let D be a convex polyhedron in Rn and let m denote the\nnumber of faces of D. Then we have the following estimates:\n\u0012\n\u0013 1\nm \u2212 n + 2 n\u22121\nm\u2212n+2\n, KO (P) \u2265\n(2.6)\nKI (P) \u2265\n,\nm\u2212n\nm\u2212n\n\nm\u2212n+2\n.\nm\u2212n\nRemark 2.20. Clearly, the same estimates hold for P L-smooth convex manifolds.\nK(P) \u2265\n\nA different slight generalization of wedges is the following one:\nDefinition 2.21. Let D \u2282 Rn be a domain. We say that D has a curvilinear\nwedge of angle \u03b1 at x0 \u2208 \u2202D iff, for all K > 1, there exists a neighbourhood\nU of x0 , such that f (U \u2229 D) = Bn \u2229 D\u03b1 .\nAnother type of related domains are the so called raylike domains:\n\nDefinition 2.22. A domain D \u2282 Rn is called raylike, with vertex v \u2208 \u2202D,\niff v + t(x \u2212 v) \u2208 D, for all x \u2208 D and any t > 0).\n\nTheorem 2.23 ([Va2], Theorem 40.3). Let D, G be domains in Rn , such\nthat G is raylike, with vertex v. If v has a neighbourhood U , such that\nU \u2229 D = U \u2229 G, then KI (D) \u2265 KI (G), KO (D) \u2265 KO (G), K(D) \u2265 K(G).\n\nRemark 2.24. These (rather straightforward) generalizations of the notion of\nwedge, allow us to extend Theorem 1.2 and Proposition 1.4 to more general\nP L embeddings, not just to piecewise flat ones (see also Section 4, (3) below).\nBefore concluding his section, let us consider again the folding map, this\ntime from a different point of view: As we have already noted, Stoilow's\nTheorem does not hold in dimensions higher than 2. There exists, however,\na characterization of those quasiregular mappings topologically equivalent\nto a folding:\n\nTheorem 2.25 (Martio-Rickman-V\u00e4isal\u00e4, [MRV]). Let f : D \u2192 Rn be a\nquasiregular mapping and let x0 be a point of D. If there exist a neighbourhood Nx0 of x0 , and a homeomorphism \u03c6x0 : Nx0 \u2192 Rn , such that\n\u03c6(Nx0 \u2229 Bf ) \u2282 Rn\u22122 \u2286 Rn , then locally at x0 , f is quasiconformally equivalent to a folding mapping (hence to z 7\u2192 z k \u00d7 Id).\n\nRemark 2.26. This result suggests an approach to the existence problem of\nP L embeddings of P L n-manifolds into Rn+1 , n \u2265 3, alternative to the one\nadopted in the present paper.\n\n2.4. Higher Dimensional Angles. Since we discuss in the following sections \u2013 mainly in Sections 5 and 6 \u2013 the role of angles (and curvatures) in\nthe case of dimension higher than 2, we succinctly present here a modicum\nof necessary definitions.\nWhile presumably intuitive, we bring here the following technical definition of dihedral angles, as given in [CMS]:\n\n\f8\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\nDefinition 2.27. A simplicial cone C k \u2282 Rk \u2282 Rn , is defined as: C k =\nk\nT\nHj , where Hj are open half spaces in general position, such that 0 \u2208\nj=1\nT\nHj , j = 1, . . . , k. Lk\u22121 = C k Sn\u22121 is called a spherical simplex.\nDefinition 2.28. Consider the simplices \u03c3 k < \u03c4 m , and let p \u2208 \u03c3 k . Define\n\u2192 | x \u2208 \u03c4 m, \u2212\n\u2192 \u03c3 k }, where \u2212\n\u2192 denotes\nthe normal cone: C \u22a5 (\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m ) = {\u2212\npx\npx\u22a5\npx\nthe ray through x and base-point p. The spherical simplex L(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m ) associated to C \u22a5 (\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m ) is called the link of \u03c3 k in \u03c4 m .\n\nRemark 2.29. C \u22a5 (\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m ) does not depend upon the choice of q.\nDefinition 2.30. The (internal) dihedral angle \u2221(\u03c4 k , \u03c3 m ) is defined as the\nnormalized volume of L(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m ), where the normalization is such that the\nvolume of Sn\u22121 equals 1, for any n \u2265 2.\n\nDefinition 2.31. Denote by L(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m )\u2217 the dual simplex of L(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m ), i.e.\nL(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m )\u2217 = {v \u2208 S | \u2221(v, u) > \u03c0/2, \u2200u \u2208 L(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m )}. The normalized\nvolume of L(\u03c3 k , \u03c4 m )\u2217 is called the exterior dihedral angle of \u03c3 k \u2282 \u03c4 m and\nwe denote it by \u2220(\u03c4 k , \u03c3 m ).\n3. The Burago-Zalgaller construction\nWe present here very briefly the main steps of the Burago-Zalgaller construction, the accent being placed on the geometric aspects of the construction and on those elements of the proof that are problematic when passing\nto higher dimensions \u2013 to be discussed in detail in the following section. For\nthe full technical intricacies of the proof, the reader should consult the original paper [BZ2]. We concentrate solely on the case of compact, orientable\nmanifolds, both because they represent the basic case (whose modification\nproduces the construction for the other cases) and because the full connection with quasiconformal mappings is displayed here (in contrast with the\nnonorientable case).\n(1) Start with a C 2 smooth, short embedding f0 of the given P L compact, closed 2-manifold P. To obtain the necessary short embedding,\none may use a suitable homotety (see [Na]).\n(2) Produce a variation of the original embedding in certain (small)\nneighborhoods of the vertices, such that each neighborhood has a\nstandard form (more precisely, a disk neighborhood) that allows us\nto produce a standard embedding in the vicinity of the vertices. The\nstandard embedding above is supplied by the standard conformal\nmap (or folding) from K(\u03b8, \u03c1) = {0 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 \u03b8, \u03c1 > 0} to K(\u03bb, r) =\n{0 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 \u03bb, r > 0} given by:\n\u03bb\n\u03c6, r = a\u03c1\u03bb/\u03b8 .\n\u03b8\n(The most important case for our purposes being: \u03bb = 2\u03c0.)\n\u03c8=\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n9\n\nThe resulting, varied embedding f1 will have different forms if the\nsum \u03b8i of the angles incident at the vertex vi is < 2\u03c0 or > 2\u03c0 \u2013 see\nalso (4) below.\nHowever, in both cases, the embedding f1 will be short in the\ncomplement of the said neighborhoods.\n(3) Replace the neighborhoods of the vertices with small disjoint polygonal neighborhoods Nv . More precisely:\n(a) If \u03b8 < 2\u03c0, encircle A by a small \"regular\" hexagon composed of\n6 triangles of apex angle \u03b8/6.\nSome small enough neighbourhood of A the will be mapped by\nthe standard conformal mapping onto a planar disk.\nOver each triangle included in such a neighbourhood, one can\nperform the basic construction (see (6) below), obtaining a P L\nisometric embedding of this neighbourhood.\n(b) If \u03b8 > 2\u03c0, proceed analogously to the previous case but\n(i) In a small circular neighbourhood of radius r1 map (a)\nisometrically on radial segments and (b) using a \u03b8/2\u03c0 contraction on circles centered at A;\n(ii) In a annular neighbourhood {r1 < r < r2 } use the standard conformal mapping with the same contraction factor\n\u03b8/2\u03c0.\nReplace the neigbourhood above with a \"cogwheel\" (i.e. a circle surrounded by isosceles \"triangles\" of sides, e.g. 2\u03b4, and\nhaving as bases arcs of the same length). The interior of each\n\"cogwheel\" is P L isometric embedded using \"ripples\". (The\nbasic element of each such \"ripple\" is a pair of congruent triangles, having a common vertex in the center of the \"cogwheel\",\none side of each being a radius, and a second common vertex\nbuilt over the midpoint of an arc used in the construction of the\n\"cogwheel\" \u2013 see Figure\n4 of [BZ2]).\nS\nThe complement of v Nv is triangulated using solely acute angle\ntriangles. (In particular, at convex vertices subdivide each triangle\ninto n2 similar triangles, for some large enough n; while at nonconvex vertices into almost regular triangles.) This has to be performed with care, so that a certain inequality ([BZ2], (5), p. 373),\nregarding the angles of the triangles composing the triangulation\nwould(will) hold. Moreover, an additional variation of the triangulation is also applied.\n(4) A further variation of f1 is performed in the complement of the union\nof the neighborhoods of the vertices. Here is employed a construction\nof Kuiper [Ku1] constituting in the adding a (finite) succession of C 2\nsmooth waves superimposed on f1 (P). The embedding f2 obtained\nin this manner is C 2 smooth and short2 Moreover, f2 will be almost\n2Again, the contraction constant can be precisely specified.\n\n\f10\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\nconformal in the complement of (sufficiently small) neighborhoods\nof the vertices vi such that the \u03b8i > 2\u03c0. (The measure of \"almost\nconformality\" is a function of \u03b1 and the degree of approximation of\nan isometry.)\n(5) The triangles obtained at the previous stages are further subdivided,\nin order to obtain of sufficiently small mesh. Here the degree of\n\"almost conformality\" is exceedingly important, since it is used to\nassure that the triangles Ti and ti (of the standard construction element \u2013 see (6) below) are almost similar and also to produce dihedral\nangles close to \u03c0. In addition, the dihedral angle between adjacent\n\"ti \" triangles are uniformly close to \u03c0.\n(6) Apply the canonical (standard) construction element:\n(a) Let T = \u25b3(A1 , A2 , A3 ) and t = \u25b3(a1 , a2 , a3 ) be acute triangles;\n(b) let B, b and R, r the centers and radii of their respective circumscribed circles;\n(c) let Ep = 12 Ak Al , ep = 21 ak al ; p, k, l \u2208 {1, 2, 3};\n(d) and let Hp = BEp , hp = bep .\nMoreover, let T \u2243 t, Ak Al > ak al , k, l \u2208 {1, 2, 3}.\nThen T can be isometrically P L embedded in R3 , as the pleated\nsurface included in the right prism with base t, such that Ak Al Ap\nfits ak Ep\u2032 al Ek\u2032 ap El\u2032 , where: B \u2032 b\u22a5t, B \u2032 ap = R and Ep\u2032 , Ek\u2032 , El\u2032 on\nthe faces of the prism, such that ak Ep\u2032 = Eip al = 21 Ak Al .\nThe following variations of the basic construction above are also\nconsidered:\n(i) Each angle \u03c6 of T satisfies the condition 0 < \u03b1 < \u03c6 and\nC * Ak Al > ak al , C < 1. Moreover, Ak Al /ak al \u2248 1.\n(ii) Each of the lateral faces of the prism \u2013 including the broken lines ak Ep\u2032 al \u2013 can be (independently) slightly rotated\naround the lines ak al such that the construction still can\nbe performed. (The rotation angle depends upon the constants \u03b1 and C above.)\n(In general, one has to simultaneously construct a large number\nof the standard construction elements above.)\nThis employment of the basic construction element may be done\nstraightforwardly in the region of \"almost conformality\" and in the\nneighborhoods of vertices vi for which \u03b8i < 2\u03c0. For vertices vi ,\nsuch that \u03b8i > 2\u03c0, a certain variation of the construction is needed:\nmore precisely P F \"ripples\" are added, see [BZ2] (and [Sa4] for a\nshort presentation). Note that here, the construction of a (local)\ntriangulation by acute triangles is essential.\n(7) We obtain a C 2 smooth, short3 embedding f2 (P) of all the standard\nconstruction elements, therefore achieving the desired P L isometric\nembedding of P.\n3again, in precise, controlled manner\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n11\n\n4. Obstructions to the Burago-Zalgaller construction in\ndimension n \u2265 3\nWe list here a number of impediments in the extension of the BuragoZalgaller construction to higher directions.\n(1) Existence of acute triangulations.\nAs we have underlined in the previous section (e.g. in (6), (7)),\nthe proof of [BZ2], is based on the existence of acute triangulations,\nmore specifically, on a previous result of Burago and Zallgaler [BZ1].4\nHowever, such a result does not exists for higher dimensions. Indeed,\nnext to nothing is known about the existence of such triangulations\nin dimension n \u2265 3.5\n(2) Nonexistence of smooth embeddings.\nAs mentioned in (2) of the previous section, a smooth \u2013 i.e. of\nclass C 2 or higher \u2013 embedding of the given P L manifold is supposed\nto exist. However, the existence of obstructions for the smoothening\nof a P L manifolds are classical (see [Mu1], [HM]). It follows that, in\ncertain cases, even the first step of the Burago-Zalgaller proof can\nnot be implemented.\n(3) Nonexistence of P L approximations.\nAs it is shown in the proof's synopsis above (see also the enunciation of Theorem 1.4 of [BZ2]), the gist of the proof is to produce\nP L isometric embeddings arbitrarily close to a given smooth one. In\nfact, the approximation is even piecewise flat6, at least away from\nKuiper waves (cf. Section 3, (4)).\nHowever, such approximations (neither P L, nor piecewise flat)\ndo not always exist in codimension 2, as it is shown in a number of\ncounterexamples due to Shtan'ko [Sh]. (It should be noted that they\ndo exist, however, in any other codimension \u2013 see [Lu].)\nSince we work in codimension 1, this obstruction is not truly relevant. It is, however, an impediment if one tries to apply the original\nNash construction [Na], that makes appeal to codimension 2, that\nis without using Kuiper's improvement [Ku1], for which only one\nadditional dimension is needed.\n(4) Standard conformal mapping\nIn Section 3, (2) the role of the standard conformal mapping is\ndescribed. Furthermore, the mapping f2 , that is supposed to be\n4As we have see, they are necessary in the definition of the canonical construction\n\nelement, in the construction modified neighborhoods of the vertices, as well as in the\ntriangulation of the compliment of the neighborhoods of the vertices (section 3, (3)). In\nconsequence, they are needed in the final modification of the construction (Section 3, (6)).\n5There seems to exist little information apart from the one summarized in [Za1]. (However, there is a renewed hope, due to a different method recently developed by Tasmuratov\n[Ta].)\n6This fact makes the Burago-Zalgaller construction apparently intuitive and attractive\nfor the Graphics community (see [Sa4]).\n\n\f12\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\nalmost conformal is introduced in Section 3, (4). While the authors\ndo not explicitly state this fact, they introduce a quasiconformal\nstructure on the given manifold, that is further deformed to become\narbitrarily close to conformality.\nUnfortunately, while any topological manifold of any dimension\nn 6= 4 admits a quasiconformal structure, by a result of Donaldson\nand Sullivan [DS], this does not hold in dimension n = 4. In fact,\nthere exists an embedding of the unit ball B4 into R4 , that admits no\nquasiconformal approximation. It follows that, in dimension n = 4,\nthe use of the standard conformal mapping is problematic. Moreover, while P L and locally flat quasiconformal approximations of\nembeddings exist for n \u2265 2, n 6= 4 and codimension m 6= 2, (see\nLuukkainen [Lu]), such approximations do not exists for n = 4 and\nq = 2 (again, by Shtan'ko's results).\n(5) Main obstruction\nHowever, the main obstruction in extending the Burago-Zalgaller\nconstruction to dimension 3 and higher, resides in the fact, already\nalluded to in Remark 2.6, that it is not possible to obtain the needed\n\"almost conformal\" quasiconformal parametrization of the neighborhoods of the vertices of a polyhedron of dimension n \u2265 3, due to the\nfact that the dilatation is bounded away from 1 as discussed in some\ndetail in Section 2.3.1 above. This fact represents the main tool\nemployed in the proof of our main results, in Section 5 below.\nRemark 4.1. It should be noted that even the shape of the initial\nsmooth embedding is important. Indeed, general \"apple-shaped\"\ndomains in Rn , n \u2265 3, do not admit any quasicomformal mapping\nonto Bn (see [Ca], [Vu]).\n5. Proofs of the Main Results\nBefore proceeding to the technical part of the proofs, let us note that, as\ntheir name suggests, quasiconformal mappings represent, indeed, the proper,\ntechnical notion for the \"almost conformal\" mappings of [BZ2] \u2013 see [Ag]\nfor precise estimates as well as proofs of the more delicate aspects of the\ntheory, regarding the non-differentiability of everywhere of quasiconformal\nmappings. (Similar estimates were also given in [Pes].)\nProof of Theorem 1.3. We show that if n \u2265 3 one can not produce, for\nany given P L manifold, quasiconformal embeddings(mappings, as close to\nconformality as desired, as it is required in the Burago-Zalgaler construction.\nFirst, let us note that the mapping fk obtained after performing each of\nthe iterations of the Burago-Zalgaller construction is, indeed, quasiconformal: By Section 3, (4) it is quasiconformal in the complement of the neighborhoods of the vertices. Moreover, in the neighborhoods of the vertices, the\nconstruction of Section 3, (3) renders, by the finiteness of the triangulation\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n13\n\nand by the finite types of simplices employed, a quasiconformal7 mapping.\nTherefore, the resulting mapping is, piecewise quasiconformal8. It follows,\nby [Va1], that it is, in fact, quasiconformal.\nMoreover, since the polyhedron is compact, the (Nash-Kuiper) limiting\nisometric f2 mapping will also be quasiconformal (see, e.g. [Va1], Theorem\n37.2) and, by [MRV], Lemma 4.5, its index will be \u2265 lim supk\u2192\u221e i(vj , fk ),\nwhere vj denote vertices of the P L manifold.\nLet F1 , F2 be two n-dimensional faces, F1 \u2229 F2 = e, and let Te \u2282 P be\na tube of radius \u01eb. Let \u03b1 = \u2221(F1 , F2 ) denote the dihedral angle between\nF1 , F2 . The dihedral wedge D\u03b1 is raylike at any interior point of e and\nTe \u2282 D\u03b1 satisfies the conditions of Theorem 2.23. It follows that K(Te ) \u2265\nK(D\u03b1 ) = \u03b1\u03c0 \u226b 0. Therefore, K(P) \u2265 max \u03b1\u03c0 , where the maximum is taken\nover all the dihedral angles of P.\nClearly, one can produce dilatation K(P) as large as desired, by choosing\npolyhedra with at least one dihedral angle (between n-faces) \u03c0/m, where m\nis any (arbitrarily large) natural number.9\n\u0003\nRemark 5.1. By a result of Heinonen and Hinkkanen [HH], at each stage of\nthe NKBZ construction, the resulting map will not only be quasiconformal,\nbut actually quasisymmetric10. That is, for compact polyhedra in some Rm ,\nthe local, infinitesimal condition of quasiconformality implies (in fact, it is is\nactually equivalent to) a global one (i.e. quasisymmetry), thence in this case\nthe local distortion of the P L Riemannian metric translates into a global\none, quantitatively11. (This fact should be viewed in the light of the brief\ndiscussion in Section 2.1).\nRemark 5.2. Note that in the theorem of Rickman and Srebro the quasiregular mapping considered is defined on a proper domain D in Rn (for some\nn \u2265 2). As such, it applies to P L-solid polyhedra P\u0303 in Rn , that is to the\ninterior of a compact polyhedral surfaces P embedded (P L isometrically)\nin Euclidean space. This corresponds perhaps to our intuition, but falls\nsomewhat short of our goal. To remedy this deficiency, one possibility is to\nuse the fact that P L quasiconformal mappings are quasiconformal [Va1] and\n7even if not, as already stressed, actually conformal\n8in a rather strong sense\n9Note that, in any case, by Corollary 2.18, the distortion coefficient of any polyhedron\n\nof dimension n \u2265 3 is bounded away from 1.\n10Recall that, given two metric spaces (X, d) and (Y, \u03c1), an embedding (in particular,\na homeomorphism) f : X \u2192 Y is called quasisymmetric iff there exists a homeomorphism\n\u03b7 : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e), such that if d(x, y) \u2264 td(x, z), then \u03c1(f (x), f (y)) \u2264 \u03b7(t)\u03c1(f (x), f (z)),\nfor any triple points x, y, z \u2208 X. Note that, while any quasiymmetric homeomorphism is\nquasiconformal, the opposite implication is far from being trivial even for mappings from\nRn to itself and holds only if n \u2265 2. In fact, it is false for n = 1. (See, e.g. [Va2], [He1]\nfor proofs and further details and [He2] for a brief, yet lucid and inspiring exposition.)\n11That is the numerical parameters obtained depend solely on the parameters presumed\nin the hypothesis.\n\n\f14\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\nclassical extension results (see, e.g. [Va2], 17.18 and 35.3),12 to show that\nthe mapping can be extended from P\u0303 to P = \u2202 P\u0303.\n\nProof of Proposition 1.4. Proceeding along lines similar to those of the\nproof of Theorem 1.3, suffices in this case to consider a polyhedron (even,\nfor simplicity, one homotopic to a sphere) whose set of vertices satisfies the\ndensity conditions required in the statement of Theorem 2.10, and whose\n(solid) angles at the said vertices are large enough to ensure that the index\nof the winding mapping at these these points will satisfy condition (2) of\nTheorem 2.10.\n\u0003\nBefore concluding this section we bring the following remark:\nGiven the fact that there exists no other method of P L isometric embedding, apart from the NKBZ construction, it is possible that there exist\nno such embedding for P L manifolds, if n \u2265 3. Therefore, in the light of\nthe results proven here and of the more general discussion in the preceding\nsection, we venture the following\nConjecture 1. For any n \u2265 3, there exists an n-dimensional P L-manifold\nM n (and in fact, an infinity of such manifolds), that admits no P L isometric\nembedding in Rn+1 .\n6. The Role of Curvature\n6.1. First Remarks. Note that the main obstruction in obtaining an almost conformal mapping resides \u2013 rather against geometric intuition \u2013 on\nthe edges of triangulation, and not at the vertices (0-dimensional faces). (See\nalso [Pet], pp. 175 and 186.) In particular, if n = 3 and M n is a a manifold\nwith boundary embedded in Rn , then small values of the dihedral angle \u03b1\n(see Section 3 and 5 above), are associated to large mean curvature H of the\nP L surface S 2 = \u2202M 3 , as opposed to the Gauss curvature concentrated at\nthe vertices (see, e.g. [Ba], [CMS]). Indeed, any pyramid with large base angles (i.e. with corresponding large dihedral angles) can be quasiconformally\nmapped onto a half-space, with bounded dilatation, which depends only on\nn and not on the angles at the vertices Ai , even if the (dihedral) face-angles,\nincident to the apex are not bounded from below (i.e having small, positive\nGauss curvature) (see [Ca], Theorem 3.6.10. and Theorem 3.6.13.).13\nIn dimension n \u2265 3, mean and Gauss curvature are replaced by the so\ncalled j th mean curvatures and Lipschitz-Killing curvatures, respectively (see\n[CMS]). Fittingly, these curvatures are also expressible in terms of (higher\ndimensional) dihedral angles. However, in order not to diverge too much,\nfor details we refer the reader to the above mentioned paper of Cheeger et\nal.\n12See also another extension result due to Tukia and V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 [TV].\n13Moreover, cones \u2013 and even cylinders, as a limiting case when the vertex angle tends\n\nto 0 \u2013 can be quasiconformally mapped onto Hn\n+ with small dilatation, and this can be\ndone independently of the vertex angle.\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n15\n\nRemark 6.1. Actually, one can dispense with the use of the initial smooth\nembedding, and formulate the bounded curvature condition for the P L (P F\nsurface) in terms of the so called generalized principal curvatures14 \u2013 see\n[Z\u00e41], [Z\u00e42]. (The fact that the C 2 smooth requirement is, in fact, too\nstrong is also noted in [BZ2], Remark 1.10. Note that a sufficient condition\nmentioned there is that the initial embedding f0 admits a C 0 approximation;\ncompare with the discussion in Sect 4, (3).)\n6.2. Unbounded 2-Manifolds. We remark here that the NKBZ construction actually holds even for unbounded (noncompact), orientable 2-manifolds,\nthat admit a \"geometrically well behaved\" isometric embedding in R3 . Formally, we can state the following result:\nProposition 6.2. Let M be a connected, oriented 2-dimensional P L manifold, without boundary or having a finite number of compact boundary components, that admits a C 2 smooth embedding into R3 . Then M admits a P L\nisometric embedding in R3 .\nRemark 6.3. Regarding the existence of an isometric embedding, with the\nprescribed curvature property see Section 6.3 below.\nProof. We begin with the simpler case of manifolds without boundary.\nNote that, again, by Nash's argument (see [Na]) we may presume that\nthe given C 2 embedding is short.\nWe can apply Peltonen's argument [Pel] (after eventually considering a\nsmoothing to the C \u221e class) to produce an exhaustion {Mi } of M .15 The\n\"size\" of the elements of the exhaustion16 is a function solely of the maximal\nosculatory (tubular) radius \u03c9M = sup{\u03c1 > 0 | S2 (x, \u03c1) osculatory at any x \u2208\nM }, where S2 (x, \u03c1) is an osculatory sphere at x \u2208 M iff: (i) S\u03bd\u22121 (x, \u03c1) is\ntangent at x; and (ii) Bn (x, \u03c1) \u2229 M n = \u2205. (For details see [Pel].) Note that\n14We recall the definition of generalized principal curvatures\nFirst, we define be the reach of X \u2282 Rn , reach(X) as:\n\nreach(X) = sup{r > 0 | for all y \u2208 Nr (X), there exists a unique x \u2208 X, nearest to y} ,\nwhere Nr (X) denotes the r-neighborhood of X.\nThen, for any 0 < \u03b5 < reach(X), \u2202N\u03b5 (X) is a C 1,1 hypersurface, hence it admits\nprincipal curvatures (in the classical sense) a.e., and let \u03ba\u03b5i (x + \u03b5n), denote the i-th such\ncurvature at a generic point. (Here n represents the normal to X at x.) We can now\ndefine the i-th generalized principal curvature as:\n\u03bai (x, n) = lim \u03ba\u03b5i (x + \u03b5n) ,\n\u03b5\u21920\n\n(and the limit exists Hn\u22121 a.a. (x, n), where, as usual, H denotes the Hausdorff measure).\n15Incidentally, Peltonen's goal was to produce a thick (or fat) triangulation of each of\nthe elements of the exhaustion, as well as of their intersections. While more technical\ndefinitions can be given (see [Sa2]), for our present purposes suffices to say that thick\ntriangulations are precisely those for which the individual simplices may each be mapped\nonto a standard (Euclidean) n-simplex, by a L-bilipschitz map, followed by a homotety,\nwith a fixed L.\n16\nas well as the (local) density of the vertices of the triangulation\n\n\f16\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\nan osculatory sphere exists at any point of M n , for all sufficiently smooth\nRiemannian manifolds \u2013 see, e.g. [Pel]. We exploit this feature to ensure that\nthat also in this case, the manifold does not intersect itself, hence that an\nembedding of a tubular neighborhood of M can be obtained, thus assuring\nthat canonical construction elements can be produced without intersections.\nThe principal curvatures will be uniformly bounded on each Mi , thence,\nby Buragogo and Zalgaller's argument ([BZ2], p. 379)), the N KBZ construction can be performed on any of these submanifolds (with boundary)\nMi . Therefore, the respective maps fi and the resulting map f will be quasiconformal, by [Ge]. Here we have to make appeal to the variation for compact manifolds with boundary of the Burago-Zalgaller construction.17Also,\nwe may have to use a subdivisions and \u03b5-moves18 to assure that, for all i,\nthe vertices on the common boundary Ni = \u2202Mi = \u2202Mi+1 appertain to the\ntriangulations of both of the considered elements of the exhaustion.\nTo obtain the extension of the proposition to manifolds with boundary,\none has to use the modification of Peltonen's construction given in [Sa2] and\napply the Burago-Zalgaller construction for each of the (compact) boundary\ncomponents.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.4. The fitting result for nonorientable 2-manifolds can also be\nproved along the same lines.\n6.3. Metric Curvature and Compatibility Conditions. We begin by\nnoting that the frustrating, and not infrequently confusing aspect of P F\nembeddings (and, in general, of P L ones), is that they are highly counterintuitive, not least with regard to the discrepancy between the intrinsic and\nextrinsic curvature. We have discussed this in some detail in [Sa4]. However,\nwe mention here an example due to O'Rourke [O'R], of a vertex in piecewise\nflat surface, for which the intrinsic Gaussian curvature, computed using the\nangle defect at the vertex (see, e.g. [Ba]) is 0, while its extrinsic one, given\neither by its generalized principal curvatures (as above) or, alternatively,\nusing metric curvatures (see below) is highly positive.\nSince the classical notion of curvature can not be defined for P L (P F )\nsurfaces, due to their lack of differentiability (at the vertex points), an analogue of Nash's Theorem for smooth 2-manifolds is not immediate, and even\nthe use of generalized curvatures (as mentioned above) does not really solve\nthe problem, and not solely due to the aforementioned counterintuitiveness.\nWe propose here an approach that allows us to formulate both local and\nglobal \"curvature sensitive\" embedding conditions in R3 for P L 2-manifolds.\nBefore proceeding further, we should emphasize here that the method we\npropose here is quite different from the one of, e.g., [Wu], [BS], [No], [MTW].\n17Note that the gluing condition of the pieces M is also given Peltonen in terms of\ni\n\n\u03c9M .\n18see, e.g., [Mu2]\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n17\n\nWe make appeal to notions and results from metric geometry. In this we\nrest mainly on [Pl]. First, we introduce some notation:\nLet S\u03ban denote the n-dimensional simply connected space\nform (i.e. S0n \u2261\n\u221a\nRn ; S\u03ban \u2261 Sn\u221a\u03ba \u2013 the n-dimensional sphere of radius \u03ba, if \u03ba > 0; and\nS\u03ban \u2261 Sn\u221a\u03ba \u2013 the n-dimensional S\u03ban \u2261 Hn\u221a\u2212\u03ba stands for the hyperbolic space\n\u221a\nof \u221a\ncurvature \u2212\u03ba, as represented by the Poincar\u00e9 ball model of radius R =\n1/ \u2212\u03ba , if \u03ba < 0).\nGiven a metric space (X, d) and x, y, z points in X. The triple {x, y, z}\n(viewed as a finite metric space) can be isometrically embedded in S\u03ban if\n(6.1)\n\nd(x, y) + d(x, z) + d(y, z) \u2264 2\u03c0 .\n\n\u221a\n\nwhere \u2212\u03ba is taken to be \u221e, if \u03ba \u2264 0.\nThe image of such an isometric embedding is unique, up to an isometry of\nS\u03ban (see, e.g. [Pl], Proposition 12), it is called the model (or representative)\ntriangle (of the triple {x, y, z}) in S\u03ban , and will be denoted by T (x\u0304, \u0233, z\u0304).\nGiven three points xi , xj , xl in a metric space (X, d), we denote by \u03b1\u03ba (xi , xj , xl ) \u2208\n[0, \u03c0], the angle \u2221(xj xi xl )19 of the model triangle in S\u03ban . Note that \u03b1\u03ba is a\ncontinuous function of \u03ba and a monotone increasing function in the variables\n\u03ba and d1 = d(xj , xl ).\nLet Q = {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 } be a metric quadruple (that is, a 4 point metric\nspace Q). We introduce the following quantities:\n(6.2)\n\nV\u03ba (xi ) = \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xl ) + \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xm ) + \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xl , xm )\n\nwhere xi , xj , xl , xm \u2208 Q are distinct , and \u03ba is any number;\n\n(6.3)\n\nA\u03ba (Q) = max V\u03ba (xi ) .\ni\n\nFrom the analogous properties of \u03b1\u03ba it follows that V\u03ba (x) is a continuous, monotone increasing function of \u03ba. (Hence A\u03ba (Q) is also monotone\nincreasing as a function of \u03ba.)\nThe first result we need to introduce our approach to a curvature-sensitive\nisometric embedding of P L manifolds is the following proposition (see, e.g.\n[Pl], Proposition 20):\nProposition 6.5. Let Q = {x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 } be a nondegenerate20 metric\nquadruple. Then Q admits an isometric embedding in S\u03ba3 iff (i) Ak (Q) \u2264 2\u03c0,\nand (ii) the triangle inequality holds for any triple \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xl ), \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xm ),\n\u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xp ). Moreover, the embedding is planar (i.e. it(Q) can be embedded in (some) S\u03ba2 ) if there exists an index i such that \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xl ) =\n\u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xm ) + \u03b1\u03ba (xi ; xj , xp ).\nThe notion on which our approach rests is the so called Wald-Berestovskii\n(metric) curvature [Wa], [Ber] (see also [Bl] for a detailed exposition on\nmetric curvatures in general):\n19that is of apex x\ni\n20A metric quadruple is called nondegenerate iff no point lies between two other points.\n\n\f18\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\nDefinition 6.6. Let (X, d) be a metric space. An open set U \u2282 X is called\na region of curvature \u2265 \u03ba iff any metric quadruple can be isometrically\nembedded in Sm , for some m \u2265 k. A metric space (X, d) is said to have(to\nbe of) Wald-Berestovskii curvature \u2265 \u03ba iff for any x \u2208 X is contained in a\nregion U of curvature \u2265 \u03ba.\nIt turns out that regions of curvature \u2265 \u03ba can be characterized easily in\nterms of the embedding angle, more precisely we have the following result\n(see, e.g. [Pl], Theorem 23):\nProposition 6.7. Let (X, d) be a metric space and let U \u2208 X be an open\nset. U is a region of curvature \u2265 \u03ba iff V\u03ba (x) \u2264 2\u03c0, for any metric quadruple\n{x, y, z, t} \u2282 U .\nNote that we can consider the Wald-Berestovskii curvature at an accumulation point (of a metric space) by considering limits of the curvatures\nof (nondegenerate) regions of diameter converging to 0. Since, by a theorem of Wald [Wa], for smooth surfaces (in R3 ), Gauss curvature and WaldBerestovskii coincide, we can now proceed and present our approach to the\nisometric embedding of P L manifolds into Rn+1 problem. First, the metric\nspace we shall consider will be the 1-skeleton of the manifold, with the obvious metric. We note that, in this context the natural choice for the open\nset U required in Definition 6.6 is the closed star of a given vertex v, that is,\nthe set {evj }j of edges incident to v. Therefore, the set of metric quadruples\ncontaining the vertex v is finite and Proposition 6.7 is readily applied.\nThe local isometric embedding condition is now easy to express, in view\nof Propositions 6.5 and 6.7. Namely, given a vertex v, the following system\nof inequalities:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 max A0 (v) \u2264 2\u03c0;\n\u03b10 (v; vj , vl ) \u2264 \u03b10 (v; vj , vp ) + \u03b10 (v; vl , vp ), for all vj , vl , vp \u223c v;\n(6.4)\n\uf8f3\nV\u03ba (v) \u2264 2\u03c0;\n\n(Here \"\u223c\" denotes incidence, i.e. the existence of a connecting edge ei = vvj ,\nand, of course, V\u03ba (v) = \u03b1\u03ba (v; vj , vl ) + \u03b1\u03ba (v; vj , vp ) + \u03b1\u03ba (v; vl , vp ), where\nvj , vl , vp \u223c v, etc.)\nHere the first two inequalities represent the (extrinsic) embedding condition, while the third one represents the intrinsic curvature (of the P L\nmanifold) at the vertex v.\nThe global embedding condition follows immediately:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 max A0 (vi ) \u2264 2\u03c0;\n\u03b10 (vi ; vj , vl ) \u2264 \u03b10 (v; vj , vp ) + \u03b10 (v; vl , vp ), for all vj , vl , vp \u223c vi ;\n(6.5)\n\uf8f3\nV\u03ba (vi ) \u2264 2\u03c0; for all vi \u2208 VM .\n\nwhere the inequalities above hold for all vi \u2208 VM . (Here VM denotes the set\nof vertices of M .)\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n19\n\nThe system (6.4) represents as a P L version of the Gauss compatibility (or\nfundamental) equation of classical Differential Geometry of surfaces, while\n(6.5) functions as a P L analogue of the similar global conditions on curvature that are satisfied in the classical Nash embedding of smooth manifolds.\nHowever, for the problem of the path isometric embedding itself, perhaps\nother methods (such as those adopted in the papers mentioned at the begining of this subsection) should be better considered. Moreover, this should\nbe regarded in view of the recent results of Matou\u0161ek, Tancer, and Wagner,\n[MTW], namely that the P L isometric embedding problem of n-dimensional\nsimplicial complexes in Rn , n \u2265 5 is undecidable and also that the more general problem of P L isometric embedding problem of n-dimensional simplicial\ncomplexes in RN , is N P -hard for N \u2265 n \u2265 (2N \u2212 2)/3, for any n \u2265 4.\nAt this point, a number of observations are mandatory:\n(1) Obviously there exists an inherent weakness in the approach above,\ndue to the fact that the Wald-Berestovskii curvature is a comparison curvature, thence only inequations, can be given, not equations.\nHowever, in the defense of the considered definition (of curvature),\nit may be said that it requires only simple computations, using just\nquite standard, elementary trigonometry (albeit in S\u03ban , for n = 2\nand n = 3).\n(2) This brings up the following natural question: Is it possible \u2013 and\nif so, how? - to actually compute the Wald-Berestovskii curvature\nof a P L manifold (or of a metric graph), using solely the metric of\nthe manifold (respectively, graph), that is without making recourse\nto an actual embedding?\nThe answer to this question is positive, at least for spaces satisfying the local existence of shortest geodesic and having bounded\n(pinched) curvature [Ber], Theorem 6 (see also [Bl]) \u2013 thence also in\nour case \u2013 it is possible to compute the embedding curvature of a\nmetric quadruple, due to a pioneering work of Wald [Wa] (see also\n[Bl] for a somewhat more recent and detailed exposition, and [Sa3]\nfor a perhaps more readily available \"digest\"). We have the following formula for the embedding curvature \u03ba(Q) of a metric quadruple\nQ:\n(6.6)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n0\nif D(Q) = 0\u221a;\n\u03ba, \u03ba < 0 if det(cosh\u221a \u2212\u03ba * dij ) =\u221a0 ;\n\u03ba(Q) =\n\uf8f4 \u03ba, \u03ba > 0 if det(cos \u03ba * dij ) and \u03ba * dij \u2264 \u03c0\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nand all the principal minors of order 3 are \u2265 0;\nwhere dij = d(xi , xj ), 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 4, and D(Q) denotes the so called\nCayley-Menger determinant:\n\n\f20\n\nEMIL SAUCAN\n\n(6.7)\n\nD(x1 , x2 , x3 , x4 ) =\n\n0 1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1 0 d12 d13 d214\n1 d212 0 d223 d224\n1 d213 d223 0 d234\n1 d214 d224 d234 0\n\n.\n\nAs far as the actual computation of \u03ba(Q) using Formula (6.6) is\nconcerned, it should be noted that, apart from the Euclidean case,\nthe equations involved are transcendental, and can not be solved, in\ngeneral, using elementary methods. Moreover, when solving them\nby with the assistance of computer based methods (e.g. making\nuse of MATLAB), they display certain numerical instability. For a\nmore detailed discussion and some first numerical results, see [Sa1],\n[SA]. (Here, again, the advantage of the approach suggested by\nPropositions 6.5 and 6.7 is evident, at least as far as the type of the\ninvolved computations is concerned.)\n(3) To compute the extrinsic curvature of an embedding (and to compare it to the intrinsic, given one) we can again make appeal to\nmetric curvatures. In this case, we shall use metric versions for the\ncurvatures of curves, to compute the maximal and minimal sectional\ncurvatures of the embedding. Again, the metric space under investigation is the 1-skeleton of the P L surface, and the considered curves\nare pairs of edges having in common the vertex at which we wish to\ncompute curvature. As options for the metric curvature of such P L\ncurves we can consider either the Menger curvature or the FinslerHaantjes curvature \u2013 see [Sa1] and [SA] for a discussion of the the\npracticability of this approach in Graphics, and for some first experimental results (as well as [Bl] for a detailed presentation of the two\ntypes of curvatures considered).\n(4) While due to the monotony of Vk , it would appear that for higher\n\u03ba there are less possible solutions for the third inequality in (6.5)\nand (6.4), it should be remembered that this inequality represents a\nprescribed condition, representing the curvature of the manifold at\nthe considered vertex.\n(5) To actually solve the system (6.5) appears to be quite difficult and we\npostpone this problem for further study. We should however, note\nhere that here we consider the isometric embedding (under curvature\nconstrains) of P L manifolds, and not the P L isometric embedding\nof such manifolds, as in Burago and Zalgaller paper (as well as in the\nfirst part of this paper). Paradoxically, the introduction of \"superfluous\" vertices, and, in consequence, of additional inequalities, may\nactually make the problem more manageable, by introducing more\ndegrees of freedom, thus rendering the embedding more flexible. We\n\n\fPLEMBEDD-AND-QR\n\n21\n\ndo not, however, know how to quantize this freedom and introduce\nthe equations.\n(6) Obviously, there is nothing special about the particular (and rather\nrestricted) case of 1-skeleta of polyhedra (or, more specific, of P L\nsurfaces), and the embedding criteria (6.4) and (6.5) can be applied\nto any locally finite metric graph. Therefore, system (6.5) represents a partial answer to a question of posed by N. Linial [Li] (see\n[Sa4]). Admittedly, in this case the notion of intrinsic curvature is\nless natural. Moreover, in the absence of triangles \u2013 whose existence\nis not guaranteed in the general \u2013 the very definition of, say, FinslerHaantjes curvature is, in this case, quite problematic. We defer such\nproblems for further study [Sa5].\n(7) It is sometimes desirable (especially in an applicative setting) to\nembed the given P L surface (or graph) either in S3 (for representation reasons), or in H3 (due to its exponential volume growth). In\nboth cases, the appropriate embedding conditions are immediate to\nobtain, from Proposition 6.5(i).\nLet us also note here that an isometric embedding criterion in Rn ,\nas well as in Sn and Hn , in terms of the Cayley-Menger and related\ndeterminants (and some related results) can be found in [Bl]. Here,\nagain, the practicability of the required numerical computations is\nfar from clear, and the advantage of our method is evident.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author wishes to express his gratitude to Peter Buser for his wonderful\nhospitality and for the numerous stimulating discussions on this theme and\nmany others that took place during the author's visits at EPFL.
