Quantum algorithms are typically understood in terms of the evolution of a multiqubit quantum system under a prescribed sequence of unitary transformations. The input to the\nalgorithm prescribes some of the unitary transformations in the sequence with others remaining\nfixed. For oracle query algorithms, the input determines the oracle unitary transformation.

The\ntask of discriminating amongst the admissible oracle unitary transformations results in an exhaustive\ncollection of algorithms which can solve the problem with certainty.\nKeywords: Quantum computing, quantum algorithms, quantum state discrimination, unitary discrimination.\nPACS: 03.67Ac, 03.67.-a, 03.65.-w\n\nORACLE ALGORITHMS AND DISCRIMINATION OF QUANTUM\nOPERATIONS\nQuantum algorithms [1, 2, 3, 4] are usually solve computational problems with the aid\nof a binary oracle function f : {0, 1}n 7\u2192 {0, 1}m , which depends on the problem. The\nsimplest case, where m = 1, occurs in the Deutsch-Jozsa [1] and Grover's [4] algorithms.\nIn quantum algorithms a given oracle, f , is invoked via unitary transformation, \u00db f ,\nwhose structure depends on the nature of the oracle. For example, in both the DeutschJozsa algorithm [5] and Grover's algorithm the oracle is defined on computational basis\nstates, |xi \u2261 |xn . . . x1 i with xi \u2208 {0, 1} , to be \u00db f |xi = (\u22121) f (x) |xi and this is extended\nlinearly to superpositions of computational basis states. The general structure of such\noracle algorithms is encapsulated in an algorithm unitary\n\u00dbalg = V\u0302M\u00db f . . . \u00db f V\u03021\u00db f V\u03020\n\n(1)\n\nwhere V\u03020 , . . . , V\u0302M are oracle independent unitary transformations and the oracle is invoked M times. This is applied to a quantum system in an oracle independent initial\nstate |\u03a8i i, giving an oracle dependent final state \u03a8 f = \u00dbalg |\u03a8i i , upon which a computational basis measurement is performed. It is important to note that the input to the\nalgorithm is the oracle unitary and not the initial state. The output from the algorithm\npotentially identifies the oracle unitary or a class of oracle unitaries. For example, in\nGrover's algorithm for searching a database one marked item at location s, f (x) = 0\nwhenever x 6= s and f (s) = 1. The standard Grover's algorithm terminates in a compuDiscrimination of Unitary Transformations and Quantum Algorithms\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n1\n\n\ftational basis measurement which yields s with high probability. Since the admissible\noracles for this problem can be labeled by s, the algorithm identifies the input oracle\nunitary with high probability. We thus regard the quantum algorithm as a tool for discriminating between classes of admissible input oracle unitaries.\nThe problem of discriminating between unitary transformations is usually reduced\nto a quantum state discrimination problem [6, 7]. This considers\napplication of one\n\b\nunitary from a collection of known possible unitaries, \u00db1 , \u00db2, . . . , any of which\nmay be invoked with known probabilities {p1 , p2 , . . .} . An (unknown) unitary from\nthis collection is selected and can be applied one or more times to a single quantum\nsystem, after which a measurement is performed so as to infer the actual unitary used.\nWe consider the case where the unitary is used once. This is converted into a standard\nstate discrimination problem [8] by choosing an initial state, described by a density\noperator \u03c1\u0302i , and applying the given unitary, \u00db j , to yield an output state \u03c1\u0302f j = \u00db j \u03c1\u0302i\u00db j\u2020 .\nThe problem of discrimination between the unitaries reduces to discrimination between\nthe states {\u03c1\u0302f 1 , \u03c1\u0302f 2\b, . . .} . This involves subjecting the system to a POVM with positive\noperator elements \u00ca1 , \u00ca2 , . . . that satisfy \u2211 j E\u02c6 j = I\u02c6 and applying an rule for inferring\nthe state from the measurement outcome (for example, if the measurement yields the\noutcome associated with E\u02c6 j , then the state was \u03c1\u0302f j ). This can be converted to an\ninference about the unitary used and the task is to find the POVM and the initial density\noperator which maximizes the probability with which the unitary is correctly inferred.\nThe central idea of this work is to use techniques for discrimination of quantum states\nor unitaries to arrive at and assess quantum algorithms. In the remainder of this article\nwe focus on the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.\n\nAPPLICATION TO THE DEUTSCH-JOZSA ALGORITHM\nThe Deutsch-Jozsa problem considers functions f : {0, 1}n 7\u2192 {0, 1} which are required\nto be in one of two possible classes : constant or balanced. A constant function returns\nthe same output for all possible arguments while a balanced function returns 0 for exactly\nhalf of the possible inputs and 1 for the other half. The problem is to determine the\nfunction class with a minimum number of oracle invocations. A classical algorithm that\nsolves with certainty requires 2n\u22121 + 1 oracle invocations in the worst case [1, 9]. A\nquantum algorithm for solving this exists [1, 9] and, in its modified form [5], uses the\noracle defined on computational basis elements as\n\u00db f |xi := (\u22121) f (x) |xi .\n\n(2)\n\nThe question that we pose is whether it is possible to arrive at quantum algorithms that\nsolve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem purely by considering the possibility of discriminating\nbetween the oracle unitaries for balanced and constant functions, given by Eq. (2).\nSince the Deutsch-Jozsa problem requires that a determination of function class\nrather than the actual function used, the discrimination problem is one of discriminating\nbetween the two classes of unitary transformations. The can be conveniently recast as a\nproblem of discriminating between two quantum operations, one corresponding to the\ntwo constant functions and the other to the set of all balanced functions. Generally either\nDiscrimination of Unitary Transformations and Quantum Algorithms\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n2\n\n\frelevant quantum operation can be represented as \u03c1\u0302i 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0302f = \u2211 f in class p f \u00db f \u03c1\u0302i\u00db f\u2020 where\n\b\np f | f in class are the probabilities with which the various unitaries within each class\nare applied. The operation for the constant class is independent of these probabilities\nand performs\n\u03c1\u0302i 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0302f const = \u03c1\u0302i .\n(3)\nFor the balanced class, we consider the case where p f are identical for all balanced\nfunctions. A detailed calculation shows that the operation is\n!\nN\u22121\n1\n(4)\n\u2212\u03c1\u0302i + N \u2211 P\u0302x \u03c1\u0302i P\u0302x\n\u03c1\u0302i 7\u2192 \u03c1\u0302f bal =\nN \u22121\nx=0\nwhere N = 2n and P\u0302x := |xi hx| . The problem of discrimination between the two classes\nof unitaries reduces to that of discrimination between the two density operators, \u03c1\u0302f const\nand \u03c1\u0302f bal . Conclusive discrimination between these requires a POVM with two elements\n\u00caconst and \u00cabal = I\u02c6 \u2212 \u00caconst . If the measurement outcome associated with \u00caconst is obtained, then it will be inferred that the state after the application of the operation is\n\u03c1\u0302f const and that hence the unitary is one for a constant function; a similar rule applies\nfor the balanced case. The probability with which\na correct inference\nwill be made\n\u0001\n\u0001\nis Pr (correct inference) = pconst Tr \u03c1\u0302f const \u00caconst + pbal Tr \u03c1\u0302f bal \u00cabal where pconst and\npbal = 1 \u2212 pconst are the probabilities with which the function is chosen from the constant or balanced classes respectively.\nThe inference will \u0001be correct with certainty for\n\u0001\narbitrary pconst \u0001if Tr \u03c1\u0302f const \u00caconst = 1 and Tr \u03c1\u0302f bal \u00cabal = 1. The requirement that\nTr \u03c1\u0302f const \u00caconst = 1 can be shown, via a series of inferences based on the positivity\nof both \u03c1\u0302f const and \u00caconst and the fact that their eigenvalues are each in the range [0, 1],\nto imply that \u00caconst is the identity operator on the support of \u03c1\u0302f const (i.e. the subspace orthogonal to the kernel) and is zero elsewhere. Applying this to the analogous operators\nfor the balanced case yields the result that the supports of \u03c1\u0302f const and \u03c1\u0302f bal are orthogonal\nor, equivalently\n\u03c1\u0302f const \u03c1\u0302f bal = \u03c1\u0302f bal \u03c1\u0302f const = 0.\n(5)\nEqs. (3)-(5) imply that\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c1\u0302i , \u039b\u0302 = 0 and\nN \u039b\u0302\u03c1\u0302i =\n\n(6)\n\n\u03c1\u0302i2 .\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u039b\u0302 := \u2211N\u22121\nx=0 P\u0302x \u03c1\u0302i P\u0302x and satisfies the requirements for a density operator. Denote\nthe orthonormal basis in which the two operators \u03c1\u0302i and \u039b\u0302 can be diagonalized simultaneously by { \u03c6 j | j = 1, . . . N}. Thus \u03c1\u0302i = \u2211M\nj=1 p j \u03c6 j \u03c6 j where M is the number of\nN\nnon-zero eigenvalues of \u03c1\u0302i and \u039b\u0302 = \u2211 j=1 \u03bb j \u03c6 j \u03c6 j . Suppose that p1 6= 0. Then Eqs. (6)\nand (7) can be shown to imply that\nM\np1\n= p1 \u2211|\u03c61 (x)|4 + \u2211 pk \u2211|\u03c6k (x)|2 |\u03c61 (x)|2 .\nN\nx\nx\nk6=1\n\nDiscrimination of Unitary Transformations and Quantum Algorithms\n\nOctober 30, 2018\n\n(8)\n\n3\n\n\fwhere \u03c61 (x) = hx|\u03c61 i . The normalized state |\u03c61 i satisfies \u2211x |\u03c61 (x)|2 = 1 and a Lagrange\nmultiplier technique demonstrates that, subject to this constraint, \u2211x |\u03c61 (x)|4 > 1/N with\nequality attained if and only if |\u03c61 (x)|2 = 1/N for all x = 0, . . .N \u2212 1. Thus Eq. (8)\nimplies\nM\np1\np1\n(9)\n>\n+ \u2211 pk \u2211|\u03c6k (x)|2 |\u03c61 (x)|2 .\nN\nN k6=1\nx\nwith equality if and only if |\u03c61 (x)|2 = 1/N for all x = 0, . . .N \u2212 1. Since the second term\non the right hand side of Eq. (9) is non-negative, the only possibility is that the equality\nholds and that |\u03c61 (x)|2 = 1/N for all x = 0, . . . N \u2212 1. This implies that pk = 0 for k 6= 1.\nThus the only possible initial states which discriminates conclusively and correctly\nwith certainty between the two classes of quantum operations for the Deutsch-Jozsa\nproblem are \u03c1\u0302i = |\u03c6 i h\u03c6 | where\n1\n|\u03c6 i = \u221a\nN\n\nN\u22121\n\n\u2211 ei\u03b8x |xi\n\n(10)\n\nx=0\n\nwith \u03b8x arbitrary real phases. The corresponding POVM elements are \u00caconst = |\u03c6 i h\u03c6 |\nand \u00cabal = I\u02c6 \u2212 \u00caconst . It is easily verified that this algorithm discriminates with certainty\nbetween balanced and constant functions regardless of a priori probabilities.\n\nCONCLUSION\nWe have shown that the techniques of unitary discrimination can be applied to yield\nan exhaustive collection of algorithms which solve the Deutsch-Jozsa problem with\ncertainty. This suggests that it may be fruitful to investigate unitary discrimination in\nthe context of other algorithms or whenever the set of input states is restricted (such as\nthermal equilibrium states in NMR).\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThe author is grateful for support from the Mesa State College Faculty Professional\nDevelopment Fund.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
