In 1914 Max Planck suggested a natural units system in which G = c = ~ = 1 and everything\nelse would be measured in centimeters. For that purpose it was assumed that Newton's equation\n(1) also holds at the quantum level. Under this condition, comparing the gravitational energy for\nm = m\u2032 with the quantum of energy for a wavelength \u03bb \u2248 r, it follows that\n~c\nm2\n=\nE =< F~ .~r >= G\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\nTogether with Maxwell equations and the laws of thermodynamics, this leads to three quantities\nwhich characterize the so called Planck regime:\nr\nr\nr\n~c\n~G\n~G\n\u221233\n19\n\u2248 10 cm, tP l =\n\u2248 10\u221244 sec\n(2)\n\u2248 10 Gev, \u03bbP l =\nmP l =\n3\nG\nc\nc5\n\u2217\n\nmaia@unb.br\n\n\fPlanck's conclusion established a landmark in the development of modern physics:\n\"These quantities retain their natural significance as long as the law of gravitation and that of\nthe propagation of light in a vacuum and the two principles of thermodynamics remain valid; they\ntherefore must be found always the same, when measured by the most widely differing intelligences\naccording to the most widely differing methods\" [1].\nToday, we can safely say that electrodynamics, actually all known gauge theories, and the laws\nof thermodynamics remain solid. However, the validity of Newton's law at 10\u221233 cm has not been\nexperimentally confirmed. It has been recently shown to hold at 10\u22123 cm, but with strong hints that\nit breaks down at 10\u22124 cm [2]. It should be noted also that the constant G is valid for the Newtonian\nspace-time which has the product topology \u03a33 \u00d7IR, where \u03a33 denotes the 3-dimensional simultaneity\nsections, implying that the gravitational constant has the physical dimensions [G] = [L]3 /[M ][T ]2 ,\nappropriate for 3-dimensional manifolds only.\nIn 1916 Newton's gravitational law changed dramatically to general relativity, including the\nprinciples of equivalence, the general covariance and Einstein's equations in a 4-dimensional spacetime\n1\n(3)\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nThe Newtonian gravitational constant G, was retained in (3), to guarantee that the theory would\nreproduce the Newtonian theory in its weak field limit, without the need to change constants.\nHowever, the consequences of this are quite embarrassing: Indeed, the maintenance of G in (3)\noriginates the hierarchy problem of the fundamental interactions. While all relativistic gauge\ninteractions are quantized at the Tev scale of energies, gravitation would be quantized only at\n\u2248 1019 Gev, which, as we have seen, coincide with the energy level predicted by Planck for Newtonian\nquantum gravity, which is the weak field limit of general relativity. Furthermore, the relativistic\nquantum gravitational theory compatible with the physical dimensions of G would be defined only\nin a 3-dimensional foliation of space-time, as originally conceived by Dirac [3], Arnowitt, Deser and\nMisner [4]. However, such foliation is not consistent with the diffeomorphism invariance of general\nrelativity [5].\nThe criticism on the validity of Planck's regime for quantum gravity is basis of the seminal\npaper by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Gia Dvali & Savas Dimopolous (ADD) [6] in 1998, inaugurating the\nbrane-world program: Using the known fact that all gauge fields are defined in four dimensions,\nthese authors proposed a solution of the hierarchy problem, assuming that the four dimensional\nspace-time in which the known gauge interactions are confined is a submanifold embedded in a\nD=4+N-dimensional space, but gravitation would access the extra dimensions, with the same\nenergy (Tev) of the gauge interactions. In the following we show how Nash's theorem provides a\nmathematical support for such program, including the necessity for gravitational propagation in\nthe extra dimensions.\n\n2\n\nNash's Theorem and Gravitational Perturbations\n\nAs far as the standard gauge theories are concerned, the 4-dimensionality of space-time is sufficient.\nThis can be understood in more general terms as a consequence of the duality operations of the\nYang-Mills equations. Defining the curvature 2-form F = F\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd , F\u03bc\u03bd = [D\u03bc , D\u03bd ], D\u03bc =\n\u2202\u03bc + A\u03bc then the Yang-Mills equations are written as\nD \u2227 F = 0 e D \u2227 F \u2217 = 4\u03c0j \u2217\nwhere the dual of the gauge curvature 2-form F is\n\u2217\n\u2217\nF \u2217 = F\u03bc\u03bd\ndx\u03bc \u2227 dx\u03bd , F\u03bc\u03bd\n= \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F \u03c1\u03c3\n\nIt follows that D \u2227 F \u2217 is a 3-form that must be isomorphic to the current 1-form j \u2217 . This condition\ndepends on the 4-dimensionality of the space-time [7, 8].\nOn the other hand, the gravitational field not being a standard gauge theory does not have such\nformal limitation. Therefore, it was assumed in [6] that gravity should propagate along extra\ndimensions. This is not al all obvious, but it has a solid mathematical justification based in the\nfoundations of Riemannian geometry. The local curvature of a manifold is given by the Riemann\ntensor\nR(U, V )W = [\u2207u , \u2207V ]W \u2212 \u2207[U,V ] W\n(4)\n\n\fwhich describes the variation of a tangent vector field W when it is dragged along a four-sided\ncontour defined by the vectors U and V . This tensor tells about the local shape of the manifold,\nwithout comparing it to anything else that could be used as a standard of shape. This implies\nthat (4) describe the curvature of a class of equivalence of Riemannian geometries with the same\ncurvature, as was stated by Riemann himself [9]: \"...arbitrary cylindrical or conical surfaces [manifolds] count as equivalent to a plane...\" In other words, the Riemann curvature is ambiguous in the\nsense that Riemannian manifolds with different local shapes have the same Riemannian curvature.\nThis situation created some discomfort until 1873 when L. Schlaefli proposed a solution for such\nambiguous situation, conjecturing that all Riemannian manifold should be embedded into a larger\n(Euclidean) space, the latter acting as the curvature reference [10].\nGeneral relativity does not present such curvature ambiguity because Minkowski's space-time\nwas set as the standard flat manifold against which all other space-time curvatures are compared.\nThe same space-time is chosen as the ground state for the gravitational field, where particles and\nquantum fields are defined. This choice would be fine, were not for the experimental evidences of a\nsmall but non-zero cosmological constant. Since the presence of this constant is not compatible with\nthe Minkowski space-time, we face a conflicting situation: Either we define particles, quantum fields\nand their vacua states in the Minkowski space-time using the Poincar group, or else these properties\nshould be defined in a deSitter space-time using the deSitter group [11]. The cosmological constant\nand the vacuum energy density based on the Poincar symmetry cannot be present simultaneously\nin Einstein's equations, without bringing up the current cosmological constant issue.\nOn the other hand, the embedding space suggested by Schlaefli can provide a curvature reference\nindependently of the ground state, thus eliminating the conflict. To see how this works, consider the\nembedding map X : Vn \u2192 VD , D = n + N satisfying the embedding equations (Index convention:\n\u03bc, \u03bd = 1..n, a, b = n + 1..D, A, B = 1...D)\nA B\nA B\nX,\u03bc\nX,\u03bd GAB = g\u03bc\u03bd , X,\u03bc\n\u03b7b GAB = 0, \u03b7aA \u03b7bB GAB = gab\n\nwere \u03b7a denotes N vectors orthogonal to Vn . When the components of the Riemann tensor of\nA B\nthe embedding space RABCD are written in the Gaussian frame {X,\u03bc\n, \u03b7b }, we obtain the Gauss,\nCodazzi and Ricci equations respectively\nA B C D\nRABCD X,\u03b1\nX,\u03b2 X,\u03b3 X,\u03b4 = R\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 \u2212 2g mn k\u03b1[\u03b3m k\u03b4]\u03b2n\n\nA B C D\nRABCD X,\u03b1\n\u03b7b X,\u03b3 X,\u03b4 = k\u03b1[\u03b3b;\u03b4] \u2212 g mn A[\u03b3mb k\u03b1\u03b4]n\nC D\nRABCD \u03b7aA \u03b7bB X,\u03b3\nX,\u03b4 = \u22122g mn A[\u03b3ma A\u03b4]nb \u2212 2A[\u03b3ab;\u03b4]\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\u2212 g mn k[\u03b3ma k\u03b4]nb\n\n(7)\n\nshowing the components of the Riemann curvature of VD expressed in terms of the Riemann tensor\nof Vn ; the extrinsic curvatures k\u03bc\u03bda (one for each \u03b7a ) and the components of the third fundamental\nform A\u03bcab .\nHowever, if the embedding space is to serve as a reference it must hold for all possible Riemannian geometries. This relevant detail is the main result of Nash's theorem of 1956, where\nhe introduced the concept of metric perturbations (or deformations) along the extra embedding\ndimensions [12]: Given the embedding of some background Riemannian geometry Vn with metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd , then we may obtain another manifold with the perturbed metric given by\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 g\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03b4g\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122k\u03bc\u03bda \u03b4y a\n\n(8)\n\nThus, Nash's perturbations not only warps the manifold, but it also stretches deforms it, so that\nall Riemannian geometries can be generated, having the curvature of the embedding space as a\nreference. Nash's theorem was soon generalized to pseudo-Riemannian spaces embedded in pseudoRiemannian Manifolds [13].\nIn order to define such perturbations the embedding must be differentiable. This condition was\nimplemented by Nash, using an smoothing operation to eliminate edges and wrinkles during the\ndeformation. We find it easier and perhaps more fundamental to understand this condition as a\nconsequence of the Einstein-Hilbert principle for the embedding space geometry:\nZ\n\u221a\n(9)\n\u03b4A = \u03b4 R \u2212GdV = 0\nwhich has the meaning that the embedding space has the smoothest possible curvature. Under\nsuch condition and from equations (5)-(7), it follows that the embedding map X must also be\n\n\fdifferentiable to produce a differentiable and continuously perturbable embedded manifold. notice\nthat in order to reproduce Einstein's gravitation, the dynamical variables in (9) must be taken to\nbe the components of the embedding space metric GAB , which are separated into the variables g\u03bc\u03bd ,\nk\u03bc\u03bda and A\u03bcab present in (5)-(7).\n\n3\n\nCosmological Applications\n\nThe standard Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model is sufficiently simple to make\nit locally embedded in a 5-dimensional flat space, satisfying Nash's differentiable conditions. Therefore, it can be taken as a background cosmology, which can be deformed along the fifth-dimension.\nHowever here we evaluate the effects of the extrinsic geometry in the FLWR background only (that\nis without perturbations). From (9) we obtain the 5-dimensional Einstein's equations\n1\n\u2217\n,\nRAB \u2212 RGAB = 8\u03c0G\u2217 TAB\n2\n\nA, B = 1..5\n\nwhere G\u2217 denotes the gravitational constant, with physical dimensions appropriate for 4-dimensional\nhypersurfaces of the 5-dimensional space, consistent with the proposed solution of the hierarchy\nproblem. Therefore, the value of G is taken to correspond to the new Planck scale, somewhere\n\u2217\nwithin the Tev scale of energies [6]. TAB\ndenotes the energy-momentum tensor of the known gauge\nfields and of ordinary matter, both confined to the 4-dimensional space-time. Since only gravitation can access the extra dimensions, general covariance cannot apply in the embedding space,\nbut it remains valid in the 4-dimensional space-time. When the above equations are written in the\nA B\nGaussian frame {X,\u03bc\n, \u03b7 }, we obtain the 4-dimensional gravitational equations (for the derivation\nof these equations see eg [14]),\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg\u03bc\u03bd + \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd + Q\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0G\u2217 T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\u03c1\nk\u03bc;\u03c1\n\u2212h,\u03bc = 0\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nwhere we have simplified the notation to k\u03bc\u03bd5 = k\u03bc\u03bd , h = g \u03bc\u03bd k\u03bd\u03bd , K 2 = k \u03bc\u03bd k\u03bc\u03bd and\n1\nQ\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212k \u03c1 \u03bc k\u03c1\u03bd + hk\u03bc\u03bd+ (K 2 \u2212 h2 )g\u03bc\u03bd , Q\u03bc\u03bd ;\u03bd = 0,\n2\nThe confinement of ordinary matter and gauge fields corresponds simply to T\u03bc5 = T55 = 0. The\ncosmological constant \u039b comes after the contracted Bianchi identity applied to the entire left-hand\nside of (10).\n\n3.1\n\nThe Cosmological Constant Problem\n\nHere we refer to the original cosmological constant problem described in [15]. Using the semiclassical\nEinstein's equations in general relativity the quantum vacuum can be described as a perfect fluid\nwith state equation pv = \u2212 < \u03c1v >=constant [16]:\n1\nm\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 Rg\u03bc\u03bd + \u039bg\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd\n+ 8\u03c0G < \u03c1v > g\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(12)\n\nm\nwhere T\u03bc\u03bd\nstands for the classical sources. Comparing the constant terms in both sides of this\nequation we obtain \u039b/8\u03c0G =< \u03c1v >, or as it is commonly stated, the cosmological constant is the\nvacuum energy density. However, current observations tell that \u039b/8\u03c0G \u2248 10\u221247 Gev 4 (here, c = 1).\nOn the other hand, admitting that quantum field theory holds up to the Planck scale, the vacuum\nenergy density would be < \u03c1v >\u2248 (1019 Gev)4 = 1076 Gev 4 . This difference cannot be resolved\nby any known theoretical procedure in quantum field theory. Even supposing that quantum field\ntheory holds to the Tev scale or less, the difference would be still too large to compensate. This\ndifficulty has become to known as the cosmological constant problem.\nHere we consider that the above difference is not only numerical, but it is mainly conceptual,\nresulting from the superposition of two incompatible ground states for the gravitational field in\ngeneral relativity: The flat Minkowski ground state was chosen to be the reference of curvature,\nbut the experimental evidences of \u039b/8\u03c0G 6= 0 however small, point to a deSitter ground state, which\n\n\fis conceptually incompatible with the Minkowski's choice. The implications being that particles and\nfields, their masses and spins defined by the Casimir operators of the deSitter group are different\nfrom those defined by the Poincar group, and they coincide only when \u039b vanishes.\nThe above numerical and conceptual conflicts can be resolved with the Schlaefli embedding\nconjecture as implemented by Nash, where the deSitter and Minkowski space-times may coexist.\nIndeed, in (10) \u039b/8\u03c0G\u2217 is a gravitational component resulting from the gravitational equations\nin the embedding space. However, the vacuum energy density < \u03c1v > is a confined quantity in\nthe space-time, regardless of the perturbations of its metric. Finally, the presence of the extrinsic\ncurvature k\u03bc\u03bd the conserved quantity Q\u03bc\u03bd of (10), imply that those constants cannot be canceled\nwithout imposing a constraint on the extrinsic curvature, which is now part of the gravitational\ndynamics in the embedding space.\n\n3.2\n\nThe Accelerated Expansion\n\nTo solve the system (10), (11) we start with the last of these equations to determine the general\nform of the extrinsic curvature for the FLRW metric. We find that\nkij =\n\nb\ngij , i, j = 1, 2, 3,\na2\n\nk44 =\n\n\u22121 d b\n\u0227 dt a\n\nwhere b(t) (= k11 ) remains an arbitrary function as a consequence the confinement condition.\nReplacing this result in (10) we obtain the modified Friedman's equation\n\u0012 \u00132\n\u03ba\n4\n\u039b\nb2\n\u0227\n+ 2 = \u03c0G\u2217 \u03c1 + + 4\na\na\n3\n3\na\n\n(13)\n\nshowing that the extrinsic curvature contributes to the accelerated expansion of the universe. To see\nthis, as a first guess to determine b(t) we have considered an analogy between the extrinsic curvature\nand the and x-matter (XCDM) phenomenological fluid [17]. Interpreting Q\u03bc\u03bd as a geometrical fluid\nQ\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\n[(px \u2212 \u03c1x )U\u03bc U\u03bd \u2212 \u03c1g\u03bc\u03bd ], px = \u03c9x \u03c1x\n8\u03c0G\u2217\n\nand comparing this with the geometric expression of Q\u03bc\u03bd for the FLRW universe, a simple equation\nfor b(t) is obtained\n\u1e03\n1\n\u0227\n= (1 \u2212 3\u03c9x )\nb\n2\na\nThis cannot be integrated because we do not know \u03c9x . However, assuming in particular that\n\u03c9x = constant = \u03c90 we obtain a simple solution\nb(t) = b0 (\n\na 1 (1\u22123\u03c90 )\n)2\na0\n\nReplacing in (13) we obtain the modified Friedman's equation\n\u0012 \u00133(1+\u03c90 )\n\u0012 \u00132\na\n\u03ba\n4\n\u039b\n\u0227\n+ 2 = \u03c0G\u2217 \u03c1 + + b20\na\na\n3\n3\na0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the constant a0 corresponds to today's radius of the universe. In particular using G = G\u2217\nthe constants b0 and \u03c90 can be adjusted to match the accelerated expansion of the universe as\ncompared with the XCDM phenomenological model [14].\n\n3.3\n\nThe Dynamics of the Extrinsic Curvature\n\nWith the application of Nash's theorem to cosmology, the extrinsic curvature assume the fundamental role of promoting the perturbations of the gravitational field. Noting that it is a symmetric\nrank-2 tensor field, it represents a spin-2 field in space-time, whose dynamics must be determined\nindependently of the fluid model.\nIn 1954 S. Gupta noted that the Fierz-Pauli equation for a linear massless spin-2 field in\nMinkowski space-time has a remarkable resemblance with the linear approximation of Einstein's\n\n\fequations [18]. He found that indeed such field must satisfy an equation that has the same formal\nstructure as Einstein's equations, defined on Minkowski's space-time.\nIn order to derive Gupta's equation for k\u03bc\u03bd for any curved manifold, we use an analogy with\nRiemannian's geometry, keeping in mind that the geometry of the embedded space-time has been\nalready defined by the metric g\u03bc\u03bd .\nIn the case of a 5-dimensional embedding space, we replace k\u03bc\u03bd by a new tensor given by\nf\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n2\n2\nk\u03bc\u03bd , and f \u03bc\u03bd = k \u03bc\u03bd\nK\nK\n\nso that f \u03bc\u03c1 f\u03c1\u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc . Then, the analogous to the Levi-Civita connection is\n\u03a5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 =\n\n1\n(f\u03c1\u03bd,\u03bc + f\u03c1\u03bc,\u03bd \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd,\u03c1 ) and \u03a5\u03bc\u03bd \u03c3 = f \u03c3\u03c1 \u03a5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n2\n\nAfter, imposing the equivalent to \"metricity condition' f\u03bc\u03bd||\u03c1 = 0, we may calculate the analogous\nof the \"Riemann curvature\" tensor\nF\u03bd\u03b1\u03bb\u03bc = \u03a5\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd,\u03b1 \u2212 \u03a5\u03bc\u03b1\u03b3,\u03bb + \u03a5\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc \u03a5\u03c3\u03bb\u03bd \u2212 \u03a5\u03bb\u03c3\u03bc \u03a5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd\nand define Ricci and scalar tensors respectively by F\u03bc\u03bd = f \u03b1\u03b2 F\u03bc\u03b1\u03b2\u03bd , F = f \u03bc\u03bd F\u03bc\u03bd . With these\ndefinitions we arrive at Gupta's equations for the f-field\n1\nF\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 F f\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b1f \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c4\u03bc\u03bd acts like a source field for the extrinsic curvature, with a coupling constant \u03b1f . A simple\nexample is given by the vacuum equation F\u03bc\u03bd = 0 which reproduces in particular the XCDM model,\nbut now without any appeal to the fluid analogy [19].\n\n3.4\n\nStructure Formation\n\nThe formation of large structures in the early universe has been mostly attributed to gravitational\nperturbations produced by other than baryons sources, generally referred to as the dark matter\ncomponent of the universe. In the present case, the extrinsic curvature solution of (15) should have\nan observable effect in space-time, independently of the perturbations. Therefore, it is possible\nthat the theoretical power spectrum obtained from (14) coincide with the observed one. In a\npreliminary analysis we obtain a power spectrum which is similar to the power spectrum from the\ncosmic microwave background radiation obtained from the WMAP experiment.\n\nFigure 1: The NASA-CAMB theoretical power spectrum resulting from (14) calculated for \u22121 \u2264 \u03c90 \u2264 \u22121/3, Massive\nNeutrinos=1, massless neutrinos =3.04.\n\nAs we see, the third peak closely matches the observed one [20].\n\n\fConcluding Remarks\nThe embedding of a space-time manifold into another defined by the Einstein-Hilbert principle may\nlead to an interesting gravitational theory, not only because its mathematical consistency provided\nby the Schlaefli conjecture as resolved by Nash's theorem, but mainly because it can meet the\ndemands of modern cosmology, with the minimum of additional assumptions.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author wishes to thank the UFRN and the organizers of the Second Indo-Brazilian Workshop.
