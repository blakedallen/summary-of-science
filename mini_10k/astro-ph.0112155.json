A detailed study of the gaseous environs of bilateral\n1\n\nMember of the Carrera del Investigador Cient\u0131\u0301fico of CONICET (Argentina)\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDubner et al.\n\nSNRs is a very useful tool to disentangle intrinsic origins (like the presence of\nbiconical beams from a central neutron star (NS), asymmetric explosions, etc.)\nfrom extrinsic causes (stratification of the interstellar density, the strength and\norientation of the ambient magnetic field, etc.).\nAs a part of an ongoing project to observe the environs of bilateral SNRs, we\nhave conducted a detailed H i study around G296.5+10.0 and G320.4\u20131.2. These\ntwo bilobular SNRs share the characteristic of harbouring an eccentric X-ray\npulsar in the interior (the source 1E 1207.4\u20135209 inside G296.5+10.0, Helfand &\nBecker 1984, and PSR B1509-58 associated with G320.4\u20131.2, Seward & Harnden\n1982). Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) we surveyed\nwide fields around these extended SNRs, looking for peculiar alignments, and/or\nproperties of the surrounding gas which may give clues as to the origin of the\nobserved radio morphology.\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nMosaic interferometric \u03bb 21 cm H i observations were carried out using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), during four sessions of 13 hours each\nin 1998. Short spacing data were added to the interferometric database in order\nto recover structures at all spatial frequencies. The single dish data were taken\nwith the Argentinian 30-m radiotelescope (IAR) for G296.5+10.0, and with the\nParkes 64-m telescope (from the SGPS survey, McClure-Griffiths et al. 2001)\nfor G320.4\u20131.2.

Its symmetry\naxis is oriented almost perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The radio quiet\nneutron star 1E 1207.4-5209 is located about 6\u2032 from the geometric center.\nAfter inspection of the H i emission within the observed velocity range (\u2013\n225,+350) km s\u22121 , we find that the best morphological correspondence between\nthe surrounding H i gas and the radio, X-rays and optical emission associated\nwith G296.5+10.0, occur between VLSR \u223c \u221217 km s\u22121 and \u201314 km s\u22121 . In\nthis velocity range some good matches are observed to the NE and along a short\nportion of the western limb of the SNR (Figure 1, left panel).\nThe distribution of the absorbing column density integrated between the\nobserver and the G296.5+10.0 shows a striking hole in the H i emission, exactly\ncoincident with the X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209 in all the three coordinates (l,\n\n\fEnvirons of Bilateral Supernova Remnants\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.\nLeft panel: Comparison of a ROSAT X-ray image of\nG296.5+10.0 (in contours) and the H i distribution around VLSR \u223c \u221215\nkm s\u22121 (in greyscale, from Giacani et al. 2000).

From this fact we independently confirm the association between\nthe NS and the SNR. The X-ray flux from the radio quiet NS must be heating\nthe local gas around 1E 1207.4-5209, thus providing a hot background against\nwhich the emission of the cold foreground H i is self-absorbed.\n3.2.\n\nThe SNR G320.4\u20131.2\n\nThis SNR has a bilateral appearance in the radio range. The optical/radio/Xray nebula RCW 89 is located on the NW extreme of G320.4\u20131.2. The young\npulsar PSR B1509\u201358 lies between the two main radio components. In the Xray wavelengths the system is dominated by the pulsar emission (also detected\nat radio wavelengths and in \u03b3\u2212rays). Recent Chandra images show with great\ndetail the bright X-ray synchrotron nebula associated with the pulsar, with a\ncollimated feature that is interpreted as a relativistic jet directed along the pulsar\nspin axis (Gaensler et al. 2002, this proceedings).\nThe H i survey of the environs have shown that G320.4\u20131.2 evolves within an\nelongated cavity, with the NW radio lobe interacting with a dense wall (atomic\ndensity n \u223c 12\u221215 cm\u22123 ) (Figure 1, right panel). Such wall would be responsible\nfor the flat appearance of the NW half of the SNR. The interaction between the\ncollimated relativistic outflow from the pulsar and the densest clump of this\nH i feature near RCW 89, would be responsible for the formation of the bright\nradio and X-rays knots and for the H\u03b1 emission of the nebula. To the SE, the\nSNR expands into a lower density medium, thus explaining the farther distance\nattained by this lobe, as well as its semi-circular morphology. An extended\nversion of this work is presented in Dubner et al. (2002).\n\n\f4\n4.\n\nDubner et al.\nConclusions\n\nBased on a detailed study of the distribution and kinematics of the H i around the\nSNRs G296.5+10.0 and G320.4\u20131.2, we conclude: (a) in the case of G296.5+10.0,\nwhich is placed far from the Galactic plane, the surrounding gas has had little influence in the morphology of the SNR. Our observations have confirmed\nthe physical association between this SNR and the isolated radio-quiet neutron\nstar 1E 1207.4-5209. Asymmetric explosion, and/or biconical outflows from\nthe neutron star, must have contributed to the present bilateral morphology of\nG296.5+10.0.; (b) in the case of G320.4\u20131.2, located in a higher density environment, the properties of the surrounding medium combined with the characteristics of the associated pulsar have conditioned the present morphology of\nthe SNR. The H i observations have revealed the existence of a cavity in the\ninterstellar medium. We propose that as a consequence of the interaction of the\nexpanding SN shock with the northern wall of this cavity, the NW radio lobe of\nG320.4\u20131.2 acquired a flatten appearance. Also, the encounter of the relativistic\npulsar outflow with this wall is probably responsible for the formation of the\noptical nebula RCW 89.\nAcknowledgments.
