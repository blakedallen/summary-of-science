In the soft\nx-ray wavelength region, polarization control (from linear to circular) is highly desirable in\nstudying ultrafast magentic phenomena and material science. The x-ray FEL is normally\nlinearly polarized based on planar undulators. Variable polarization could in principle be\nprovided by employing an APPLE-type undulator [4]. However, its mechanical tolerance\nfor lasing at x-ray wavelengths has not been demonstrated, and its focusing property may\nchange significantly when its polarization is altered. An alternative approach for polarization\ncontrol is the so-called \"crossed undulator\" (or \"crossed-planar undulator\"), which is the\nsubject of this paper.\nThe crossed-planar undulator was proposed by K.-J Kim to generate arbitrarily polarized light in synchrotron radiation [5] and FEL sources [6]. It is based on the interference\nof horizontal and vertical radiation fields generated by two adjacent planar undulators in a\ncrossed configuration (see Fig. 1). A phase shifter between the undulators is used to delay\nthe electron beam and hence to control the final polarization state. For incoherent radiation\nsources, the radiation pulses generated in two adjacent undulators by each electron do not\noverlap in time. Thus, a monochromator after the second undulator is required to stretch\nboth pulses temporally in order to achieve interference. The degree of polarization is limited\nby beam emittance, energy spread, and the finite resolution of the monochromator, as studied in a series of experiments at BESSY [7, 8]. On the other hand, for completely coherent\nradiation sources (such as generated from a seeded FEL amplifier or an FEL oscillator),\nthe interference occurs due to the overlap of two radiation components in the second undulator [6]. A recent crossed-undulator experiment at the Duke storage ring FEL reported\ncontrollable polarization switches with a nearly 100% total degree of polarization [9].\nIt is well-known in the FEL community that SASE light is transversely coherent but\ntemporally chaotic due to the shot noise startup. Thus, the effectiveness of the crossed\nundulator for polarization control deserves a detailed study. In this paper, starting with\none-dimensional (1D) FEL theory, we calculate both radiation components and generalize\nthe results of Ref. [6] to the case of SASE. We then determine the required length of the\nsecond undulator in order to produce the same average power as that produced in the\n2\n\n\fy\nx\nEy\nEx\n\nz\nPhase\nUndulator-2\nShifter\n\nUndulator-1\n\nFIG. 1: (color) Schematic of the crossed undulator for polarization control\n\nfirst undulator. We show that the degree of polarization can be determined by the time\ncorrelation of the two radiation fields and compute its asymptotic expression in the highgain limit. The analytical results are compared with 1D SASE simulations after a proper\nstatistical averaging. Finally, three-dimensional (3D) effects and simulation results are also\ndiscussed.\n\nII.\n\nFIELD CALCULATION\n\nFigure 1 shows a schematic of the crossed undulator applied to a SASE FEL. In the\nfirst planar undulator with a total length L1 , spontaneous radiation is amplified to generate\nhorizontally polarized SASE field Ex . In the second undulator (of length L2 ) that is rotated\n90\u25e6 with respect to the first one, Ex propagates freely without interacting with the electron\nbeam, while a vertically polarized radiation field Ey is produced by the micro-bunched beam.\nA simple phase shifter such as a four-dipole chicane placing between the two undulators can\nslightly delay the electrons in order to adjust the relative phase of the two polarization\ncomponents.\nIn this section, we determine both SASE field components generated by the crossed\nundulator. Let E(z, t) be the complex but slowly varying electric field at undulator distance\nz and time t. We write\nE(z, t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03c91 d\u03bd\n\u221a E\u03bd (z)ei\u2206\u03bd[(k1 +ku )z\u2212\u03c91 t] ,\n2\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c91 = k1 c is the fundamental resonant frequency corresponding to the average beam\nenergy (c is the speed of light); \u03bd = \u03c9/\u03c91 and \u2206\u03bd = \u03bd \u2212 1 is the relative frequency detuning,\nku = 2\u03c0/\u03bbu with \u03bbu the undulator period. Following Refs. [10, 11], the 1D FEL interaction\nstarting from shot noise can be described by the coupled Maxwell-Klimontovich equations.\n3\n\n\fIn the small signal regime before FEL saturation, the equations can be linearized and solved\nby the Laplace transformation:\n\nd\u03bc\n(\u2212i2\u03c1ku )e\u2212i2\u03c1\u03bcku z E\u03bd,\u03bc ,\n2\u03c0i\nI\nd\u03bc \u2212i2\u03c1\u03bcku z \u03ba1 E\u03bd,\u03bc dV /d\u03b7 \u2212 F\u03bd (0)\nF\u03bd (z) =\ne\n,\n2\u03c0i\n(\u03b7/\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc)\n\nE\u03bd (z) =\n\nI\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ni\ni\u03ba2 n0\nF\u03bd (0)\nE\u03bd,\u03bc =\nE\u03bd (0) +\nd\u03b7\n,\n2\u03c1ku D(\u03bc)\n2\u03c1ku\n\u03b7/\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc\nZ\n\u2206\u03bd\nV (\u03b7)\nD(\u03bc) = \u03bc \u2212\n\u2212 d\u03b7\n.\n2\u03c1\n(\u03b7/\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc)2\n\n(3)\n\nHere E\u03bd and F\u03bd are, respectively, the Fourier components of the electric field and of the\nKlimontovich distribution function that describes the discrete electrons in longitudinal phase\nspace, with E\u03bd (0) and F\u03bd (0) the Fourier components of the initial conditions; D(\u03bc) = 0\ndetermines the FEL dispersion relation where \u03bc is the Laplace parameter. In addition,\nparameter \u03c1 is the dimensionless FEL Pierce parameter [12], V (\u03b7) is the electron energy\ndistribution with \u03b7 the relative energy deviation, n0 is the electron volume density; \u03ba1 =\neK[JJ]/(4\u03b302 mc2 ), \u03ba2 = eK[JJ]/(2\u01eb0 \u03b30 ), where K is the dimensionless undulator strength\nparameter, the Bessel function factor [JJ] is equal to [J0 (\u03be) \u2212 J1 (\u03be)] with \u03be = K 2 /(4 + 2K 2 ),\n\n\u03b30 is the initial electron energy in units of mc2 , and \u01eb0 is the vacuum permittivity. Note\n\nthat the contour integration of \u03bc in Eq. (2) must enclose all singularities in the complex \u03bc\nplane. Based on this solution, we can calculate radiation field components in the crossed\nundulator according to their initial conditions.\n\nA.\n\nHorizontal radiation field\n\nThe radiation field Ex in the first undulator develops from electron shot noise, with the\ninitial conditions\nE\u03bdx (0)\n\n= 0,\n\nZ\n\nF\u03bdx (0)d\u03b7\n\nNe\n1 X\nei\u03bd\u03c91 tj (0) ,\n=\nN\u03bb j=1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere N\u03bb is the number of electrons in one radiation wavelength, and tj (0) is the random\narrival time of the j th electron at the entrance to the first undulator. We assume the first\n4\n\n\fundulator operates in the exponential growth regime. In this regime, the dispersion relation\nhas a solution \u03bc0 with a positive imaginary part that gives rise to an exponentially growing\nfield amplitude. For a cold beam with vanishing energy spread, we take V (\u03b7) = \u03b4(\u03b7) in\nEq. (2) and obtain\nN\n\nE\u03bdx (z)\n\ne\n\u2212i\u03ba2 n0 \u2212i\u03bc0 2\u03c1ku z X\n=\ne\nei\u03bd\u03c91 tj\n2\u03c1ku N\u03bb 3\u03bc0\nj=1\n\nfor z \u2264 L1 .\n\n(5)\n\nIn this high-gain regime, the electron distribution from Eq. (2) can be simplified as [6]:\nF\u03bdx (z) =\n\ni\u03ba1 E\u03bdx (z)dV /d\u03b7\n2ku (\u2212\u03bc0 \u03c1 + \u03b7)\n\nfor z \u2264 L1 .\n\n(6)\n\nThis electron distribution function will be used as an initial condition for the calculation of\nthe vertical radiation field as follows.\n\nB.\n\nVertical radiation field\n\nThe radiation field Ey in the second undulator is generated by the pre-bunched electron\nbeam in the first undulator. To control the radiation polarization, the required path length\ndelay of the phase shifter chicane is on the order of the FEL wavelength. Such a weak\nchicane does not have dispersive effects that could result in micro-bunching, such as can be\nfound for example in an optical klystron (see, e.g., Ref. [13]). Hence, the initial conditions\nat the entrance of the second undulator is\nE\u03bdy (0) = 0 ,\n\nF\u03bdy (0) = F\u03bdx (L1 ) .\n\n(7)\n\nAs the electron beam develops micro-bunching during the FEL interaction in the first\nundulator, it will radiate coherently in the second undulator. From discussions in Ref. [6]\nand simulation results shown in Sec. IV below, the intensity of Ey can increase to the same\nlevel as that of Ex in about one gain length. Thus, for a relatively short second undulator,\nwe consider only coherent radiation and ignore any feedback of the radiation on the electron\nbeam. With this approximation, the third term at the right hand side of D(\u03bc) in Eq. (3)\ncan be dropped, and Eq. (2) can now be written as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\nI\nF\u03bdx (L1 )\nd\u03bc e\u2212i2\u03c1\u03bcku z2 i\u03ba2 n0\ny\ni\u03c6\nd\u03b7\nE\u03bd (z2 ) =e\n2\u03c0i \u03bc \u2212 \u2206\u03bd/2\u03c1 2\u03c1ku\n\u03b7/\u03c1 \u2212 \u03bc\nI\n\u2212i2\u03c1\u03bcku z2\nx\nE\u03bd (L1 ) \u03bc + \u03bc0\nd\u03bc e\n.\n= \u2212 ei\u03c6\n2\u03c0i \u03bc \u2212 \u2206\u03bd/2\u03c1 \u03bc20\n\u03bc2\n5\n\n(8)\n\n\fHere z2 is the undulator distance from the beginning of the second undulator. The extra\nphase factor ei\u03c6 is introduced by the phase shifter just before the second undulator. In the\nlast step of Eq. (8), we have taken a cold beam with vanishing energy spread and made\nuse of the relation \u03ba1 \u03ba2 n0 = 4ku2 \u03c13 . Note that \u03bc0 is the exponential growth solution that\nsatisfies D(\u03bc0 ) = 0 and is a function of the detuning parameter \u2206\u03bd, i.e.,\n\u221a \u0014\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0015\n3\n1\n\u2206\u03bd (\u2206\u03bd)2\n(\u2206\u03bd)2\n\u03bc0 \u2248 \u2212 1 \u2212\n1\u2212\n+i\n.\n+\n2\n3\u03c1\n36\u03c12\n2\n36\u03c12\nEq. (8) can be solved by the residue theorem:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0003\n\u03c8 2i \u0002\ny\nx\ni(\u03c6\u2212\u03c8/2)\nE\u03bd (z2 ) = E\u03bd (L1 )e\nsinc\n\u03c1ku z2 \u2212 \u03bc0 ei\u03b1 (\u03c1ku z2 )2 ,\n2\n2 \u03bc0\n\nwhere sinc(x) = sin(x)/x, \u03c8 = \u2206\u03bdku z2 , and\n\u0014\n\u0015\nsin(\u03c8/2)\n\u03b1 = arctan\n.\nsinc(\u03c8/2) \u2212 cos(\u03c8/2)\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\nNote that \u03b1 = \u03c0/2 when \u2206\u03bd = 0. The first term in the square bracket of Eq. (10) describes\ncoherent spontaneous radiation from a density-modulated beam and grows linearly with\nthe undulator distance z2 (as discussed in Ref. [14] in the context of harmonic generation).\nSince the electron beam from the first undulator possesses not only density modulation but\nalso energy modulation, the momentum compaction of the second undulator can convert\nthe energy modulation into additional density modulation. Thus, the second term in the\nsquare bracket of Eq. (10) describes the enhanced radiation due to the evolution of the density modulations inside the second undulator which grows quadratically with the undulator\ndistance.\nIn order to generate circularly polarized light, we require that both Ex and Ey have the\nsame average amplitude.

At the end of the second undulator when z = L1 + L2 , these\nradiation fields in the time domain are\nZ\n\u03c91 d\u03bd y\n\u221a E\u03bd (z2 = L2 )ei\u2206\u03bd[(k1 +ku )(L1 +L2 )\u2212\u03c91 t] ,\nEy (t) =\n2\u03c0\nZ\n\u03c91 d\u03bd x\n\u221a E\u03bd (z = L1 )ei\u2206\u03bd[(k1 +ku )L1 +k1 L2 \u2212\u03c91 t] .\nEx (t) =\n2\u03c0\n\n(14)\n\nNote that we only used Eq. (1) for Ex at z = L1 (and t1 ) and applied the free space\npropagation phase factor ei\u2206\u03bd[k1 L2 \u2212\u03c91 (t\u2212t1 )] in the second undulator as Ex does not interact\nwith the electron beam there. Because of the chaotic nature of SASE radiation, we perform\na statistical analysis to quantify the state of polarization.\nFollowing the standard optics textbooks (see, e.g., Refs. [15, 16]), the state of polarization\ncan be described by the coherency matrix\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nhEx (t)Ex\u2217 (t)i hEx (t)Ey\u2217 (t)i\n\uf8fb,\nJ=\uf8f0\n\u2217\n\u2217\nhEy (t)Ex (t)i hEy (t)Ey (t)i\n\n(15)\n\nwhere * means complex conjugate, and the angular bracket refers to the ensemble average.\nThe degree of polarization can be calculated as [15, 16]\ns\ndet[J]\n,\nP \u2261 1\u22124\n(tr[J])2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere det[J] and tr[J] are the determinant and trace of the coherency matrix, respectively.\nIt is also convenient to introduce the first-order time correlation between Ex and Ey as\ngxy \u2261\n\nhEx (t)Ey\u2217 (t)i\n.\n[h|Ex (t)|2 ih|Ey (t)|2 i]1/2\n\n(17)\n\nFor polarization control in the crossed undulator, we are particularly interested in the\ncase when the average intensities of the two radiation components are the same: h|Ex (t)|2 i =\n \u0304 Under this condition, the coherency matrix simplifies to\nh|Ey (t)|2 i = I.\n\uf8ee\n\nJ = I \u0304 \uf8f0\n\n1\n|gxy |e\u2212i\u03b8\n7\n\ni\u03b8\n\n|gxy |e\n1\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb,\n\n(18)\n\n\fwhere \u03b8 is the phase difference between Ex and Ey . When \u03b8 = \u00b1 \u03c02 , the combined radiation\n\nis circularly polarized; when \u03b8 = 0 or \u03c0, it is linearly polarized at \u00b145\u25e6 relative to the\nhorizontal axis. The state of polarization is controllable by adjusting the phase shift \u03c6 in\n\nEq. (10) so that the net phase in gxy is \u03b8 = \u00b1 \u03c02 or 0/\u03c0. With equal intensity in both\ntransverse directions, the degree of polarization in Eq. (16) is simply given by the amplitude\nof the x-y time correlation, i.e.,\nP = |gxy | .\n\n(19)\n\nIn the x-ray wavelength region, the electron bunch duration is typically much longer than\nthe coherence time of the SASE radiation. Thus, a SASE pulse consists of many random\nintensity spikes that are statistically independent. For a flattop current distribution (of\nwidth T ), we can convert the ensemble average of Eq. (17) into a time average as\nZ T /2\n1\ngxy = lim  \u0304\ndtEx (t)Ey\u2217 (t)\nT \u2192\u221e IT \u2212T /2\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u03c91 d\u03bdE\u03bdx (L1 )E\u03bdy\u2217 (L2 )e\u2212i\u2206\u03bdku L2 ,\n= \u0304\nIT \u2212\u221e\n\n(20)\n\nwhere we have applied Eq. (14) and the Parseval relation in converting the time integration\nto the frequency integration. Assuming that the first undulator operates in the exponential\ngain regime, the frequency dependence of E\u03bdx is approximately Gaussian, i.e.,\nh|E\u03bdx (z)|2 i\n\n2\n \u0304\nIT\n\u2212 (\u2206\u03bd)2\n2\u03c3\n\u03bd ,\ne\n=\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3\u03c9\n\nwhere the relative rms SASE bandwidth is [10, 11]\ns\n\u03c3\u03bd = \u03c3\u03c9 /\u03c91 =\n\n\u221a\n\n(21)\n\n9\u03c1\n.\n3ku L1\n\n(22)\n\nSince the short second undulator generates coherent radiation from a pre-bunched beam\nthat possesses the same narrow bandwidth \u03c3\u03bd , we can expand \u03bc20 in Eq. (10) to first order\nin \u2206\u03bd by using Eq. (9). We also ignore the frequency dependence of the second term in the\nsquare bracket of Eq. (10) because its contribution to the radiation intensity is relatively\nsmall. Finally, we have\n1\n|gxy | \u2248 \u221a\n2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nd\u03bd\u0304\n\n\u0010 2\n\u0011\nexp \u2212 \u03bd\u03042 \u2212 i \u03bd\u0304\u03c3\u03bd k2u L2 sinc\n1 + (\u2212 12 + i\n\n\u221a\n\n3 \u03bd\u0304\u03c3\u03bd\n) 3\u03c1\n2\n\n\u03bd\u0304\u03c3\u03bd ku L2\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere \u03bd\u0304 = \u2206\u03bd/\u03c3\u03bd . In view of Eq. (13), we take L2 = 1.3LG in Eq. (23) and obtain the\ndegree of polarization by computing |gxy |.\n8\n\n\fTABLE I: Main parameters for the LCLS soft x-ray FEL used in simulations.\nParameter\n\nvalue unit\n\nelectron beam energy\nrelative energy spread\nbunch peak current\n\n0(0.023) %\nkA\n\n1.2\n\n\u03bcm\n\naverage beta function\n\n8\n\nm\n\nundulator period \u03bbu\n\n3\n\ncm\n\nundulator parameter K\n\nA.\n\nGeV\n\n2\n\ntransverse norm. emittance\n\nIV.\n\n4.3\n\n3.5\n\nFEL wavelength\n\n1.509\n\nnm\n\nFEL \u03c1 parameter\n\n0.119\n\n%\n\n1D power gain length LG\n\n1.17\n\nm\n\n3D power gain length L3D\nG\n\n1.48\n\nm\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\n\n1D results\n\nWe first use a 1D FEL code to simulate the SASE radiation produced by the crossed\nundulator configuration and to analyze the degree of polarization. The code follows the\ntime-dependent approach developed in Ref. [17] and employs the shot noise algorithm of\nPenman and McNeil [18]. Electron energy spread can be included using Fawley's beamlet\nmethod [19]. After computing the Ex field produced in the first undulator, we allow Ex to\npropagate freely without further interacting with the electron beam. The simulated electron\ndistribution from the first undulator is then used to generate the Ey field in the second\nundulator.\nAs a numerical example, we use the parameter set listed in Table I that is similar to the\nsoft x-ray LCLS operation [1]. In the 1D simulations, the energy spread is set to zero since\nwe want to compare with the previous analytical results.\nFig. 2 shows the average radiation power in both x and y directions produced by the\ncross undulator.

Here L1 is the length of the first undulator, L2 = 1.3LG = 1.53\nm is the length of the second undulator.\n\nundulator length L2 = 1.3LG \u2248 1.53 m is held constant. As predicted by Eq. (13), the\npower of the two radiation components are essentially the same in the exponential gain\nregime. Near saturation, the power of the vertical field is lower than that of the horizontal\none because the FEL-induced energy spread starts to de-bunch the electron beam in the\nsecond undulator. We repeat the simulations 200 times for each L1 with different random\nseeds to start the process and calculate the first-order time correlation between Ex and Ey\nat the exit of the second undulator using the ensemble average defined in Eq. (17). Figure 3\nshows the amplitude of this correlation from the simulation results as well as the numerical\nintegration of Eq. (23) (the red solid curve) for a comparison. When the first undulator\nis less than a couple of gain lengths, the crossed undulator operates in the spontaneous\nemission regime, the amplitude of the x-y correlation and hence the degree of polarization\nare very small without the use of a monochromator. The degree of polarization increases in\nthe exponential growth regime and reaches a maximum of 85% near the FEL saturation. In\nthis regime and especially when the gain is very high, we see very good agreement between\nsimulations and Eq. (23). In the saturation regime, the amplitude of the x-y correlation\nstarts to decrease, and the linear theory starts to deviate from the simulation results.\nThere are two effects that prevent the degree of polarization to reach 100% in a crossedundulator SASE FEL. First, there is relative slippage between Ex and Ey in the second\n10\n\n\f1\n\n| gxy |\n\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\nL1 (m)\n\n20\n\n25\n\nFIG. 3: (color) Amplitude of the time correlation |gxy | from the 1D simulations (black star) and\nfrom Eq.

(24) (see text for\nmore details).\n\nundulator. Since Ex stops interacting with the electron beam after the first undulator, the\ngroup velocity of Ex is the speed of light c. However, the group velocity of Ey is slower than\nc because it is generated by the micro-bunched beam that travels at the average longitudinal\nvelocity \u03b2k c. In fact, 1D simulations indicate that the group velocity of Ey is almost the\nsame as that of the electrons within the short second undulator section. (This numerical\nresult is also confirmed in 3D simulations to be discussed in the next section.) To estimate\nthe slippage effect, we take Ey (t) \u2248 Ex (t \u2212 \u03c4 ) with c\u03c4 = L2 (1 \u2212 \u03b2k ) and apply the first-order\ntime correlation function of the SASE field to estimate |gxy |:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0\u03c4 2\n(24)\ng(\u03c4 ) = exp \u2212 2 ,\n2\u03c4c\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c4c = \u03c0/\u03c3\u03c9 is the coherence time [20], and \u03c3\u03c9 is given by Eq. (22). Equation (24)\nyields the blue dashed curve shown in Fig. 3, which indicates that the slippage effect only\naccounts for about a half of the depolarization in the crossed undulator. A careful examination of the intensity profile between Ex and Ey shows a visible difference from a simple\ntime delay (see Fig. 4 for a 3D example). This accounts for the additional depolarization\neffect in a crossed undulator SASE FEL.\n\n11\n\n\fB.\n\n3D Discussions\n\nA remarkable feature of a SASE FEL is its transverse coherence. At a sufficiently high\ngain, a single transverse mode with the largest growth rate will dominate over all other\ntransverse modes for a typical SASE FEL. Thus, we expect the previous 1D analysis still\napplies to 3D situations in the high gain limit, with the maximum polarization obtainable at\nthe end of the exponential growth regime. Since the length of the second undulator is short,\nthe diffraction effects for the free-propagating Ex in the x-ray wavelength regime is expected\nto be small. Thus, the 3D effects such as emittance and diffraction do not play significant\nroles in determining the degree of polarization for a crossed undulator SASE FEL.\nWe use the 3D FEL code GENESIS 1.3 [21] to check these expectations. The electron\nbeam is dumped at the end of the first undulator and is used to generate Ey in the second\nundulator. Ex propagates in the same length of the second undulator but without any\nundulator magnetic field. We use the same soft x-ray FEL example listed in Table I as the\n1D case but with a relative energy spread of 0.023%, which roughly corresponds to the LCLS\nsoft x-ray parameters. The length of the first undulator is chosen to be 23 m and is about 3 m\nbefore the saturation point. A 2-m short second undulator is necessary to produce the same\nradiation power for the vertical field (see Fig. 4). The 3D power gain length corresponding to\nthese parameters is L3D\nG = 1.48 m, so Eq. (13) approximately holds in this 3D case. We use\nthe on-axis far-field radiation intensity and phase from GENESIS simulations to calculate\nthe time correlation between Ex and Ey of Eq. (17). Instead of performing many statistical\nruns for the ensemble average, we average the result over hundreds of intensity spikes within\nthe radiation pulse in order to save on simulation effort. The amplitude of the x-y correlation\nfrom this 3D calculation is 87%, very close to the 1D prediction. Figure 4 shows the central\nsection of the simulated power profiles Px and Py at the end of the second undulator. A\nsmall time delay due to the slippage effect and a somewhat different temporal structures\nbetween Px and Py are the main depolarization effects, as discussed in the previous section.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe statistical analysis presented in this paper shows that the crossed-planar undulator\nis an effective method for polarization control in a SASE FEL.

The maximum degree of polarization is over 80% from both\ntheory and simulations. If fast pulsed magnets are employed in the phase shifter chicane, the\nrelative phase between the two radiation components from the crossed undulator can vary at\nhundreds of Hz, hence enabling fast polarization switching for many scientific applications.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank P.
