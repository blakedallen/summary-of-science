China\nDecember 4, 2018\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing the idea that information is the negative entropy, we propose that\nthe information and entropy of an isolated system can convert into each other\nwhile the sum of them is an invariant for any physical process. The holographic\nprinciple is then reformulated in the way that this invariant is bounded by\nthe Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the system. It is found that Heisenberg's\nuncertainty relation in quantum mechanics can be derived from this bound.\nPACS number(s): 03.65.Ta,04.60.-m,03.67.-a\n\nThe concepts of information and entropy [1, 2] play more and more important roles\nin physics both in technical and theoretical aspects [3]. It seems that information is more\nfundamental than space as well as matter since each physical law must be written in terms\nof a certain type of information such as coordinate, curvature, energy, mass, etc.. Hence,\nin order to construct the unified law of all interactions in nature, one should inquire what\nare the informational contexts of space and matter and how to measure these physical\nquantities in a unified framework of information. Ever since the holographic principle was\nproposed [4, 5] the information and entropy manifest themselves as key concepts as a guide\nfor constructing successful theory of quantum gravity (for recent review, see [6]). The\ninformation, known as how much uncertainty can be eliminated in light of an observer,\ncan be defined as the deviation of the actual entropy of a system from the maximal\nentropy that the system may contain [7]. The feature of information is that an observer's\nacquiring of information about an isolated system is always associated with decreasing of\nuncertainty on the system. Since information describes the observer's capability to predict\nthe outcome of physical system some time later, it is an observer-dependent quantity.\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: jzchen511@yahoo.com.cn\n\n1\n\n\fHowever, the sum of the information and entropy may be of physically significant if this\nsum is independent of the observers.\nIn this Letter, we argue that information and entropy of a system are two sides of one\ncoin in the sense that they can convert into each other in the process of measurement\nand evolution of the system while the sum of them is an invariant. We show that this\ninvariant is the maximal information (or entropy) by which the holographic principle\nis reformulated. By applying this assumption to a system of one particle, we derive\nuncertainty relation from the holographic principle.\nLet p be the probability of obtaining the information I for an observer. The relation\nbetween them can be given by the fact that probability is multipliable while information\nis additive:\nI = k ln(1/p).\n\n(1)\n\nThis is the well-known Shannon formula for information. By setting k = 1/ ln 2, one finds\nthat Eq. (1) becomes\nI = log2 (1/p).\n\n(2)\n\nThis implies I = 1 when p = 1/2, that is, the information to make decision in two possible\nchoices with equal probability is exactly 1 bit.\nSince the probabilities pi of acquiring the different information Ii vary or depend on\nthe contexts of the information Ii , i = 1, * * *, N, the total amount of information should\nP\nbe the direct sum of Ii : I = N\ni=1 Ii . The average information I is\nI=\n\nN\nX\n\np i Ii = \u2212\n\ni=1\n\nN\nX\n\npi log2 pi .\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nIt is evident that in the case of equal probabilities pi = p for all pi\nI = \u2212 log2 p = \u2212k ln p = Ii .\n\n(4)\n\nThis enable us to look the i-th information Ii as average information.\nWe know that entropy is the measurement of how much a system is in disorder while\nI is exactly the opposite. For this reason, one can define the information of an observer\nas the deviation of the actual entropy from the maximal entropy [7]. Clearly, this concept\nis well defined for an isolated system only if we assume that the maximal entropy is\nfixed. Motivated by the general consideration of the relationship between information\nand entropy in physics and beyond, we propose an ansatz that the sum of entropy and\ninformation (or, the total IE) is an invariant for an isolated system:\nS + I = Invariant.\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fin which the constant keep invariant during the system evolution. This implies that for\nan observer the entropy S of an isolated system will decrease as information I about it\nincreases, and vice versa. In this sense, information is nothing but IE though it may have\nnot become into knowledge about the system for a specified observer. In the following,\nwe will provide a demonstration of why this is so.\nAccording to the standard thermodynamics, the entropy S of an isolated system is\ngiven by the Boltzman formula\nS = kB ln W,\n\n(6)\n\nin which W is the total number of the microscopic states corresponding to a macroscopic\nstate of the system. Notice that p in Eq. (1) is the probability of the macro-state\nappearing as an information, one has p = W * p0 , where p0 is the probability of a microstate appearing. Hence, if we choose unified unit for information and entropy in (1) and\n(6) so that kB = k, one finds\nkB ln W + k ln(1/p) = k ln(1/p0 ) = I0 .\n\n(7)\n\nFor an isolated system with definite volume, N is the total number of the elementary\nparticles, which is fixed. Since volume element L in phase space is finite and definite,\np0 = 1/LN is also definite. This shows that Eq. (5) holds for the system.\nWe rewrite Eq. (7) as\nS = I0 \u2212 I.\n\n(8)\n\nThen when an observer finally acquires, by repeating measurements enough times, maximal amount of information Imax about a given system, one finds I0 = Imax , that is\nS = Imax \u2212 I.\n\n(9)\n\nEq. (9) indicates that entropy is the measurement of a part of information that the\nobserver is short of in trying to accurately describe the states of system.\nNow that the conservation equation (5) should hold for any physical system on matter\nwhat underlying interactions involved, it must be true for a black hole. For a black hole\nwith horizon area A we know from the well-known Bekenstein-Hawking formula [8, 9, 10]\nthat its entropy is given by\nSBH =\n\nkB A\n,\n4lp2\n\n(10)\n\nin which lp = (G~/c3 )1/2 stands for the Planck length. In the Planck unit this entropy is a\nquarter of the area of its horizon. Since we know nothing about the black hole (IBH = 0),\nit follows from Eq. (5) that\nSBH = Imax .\n3\n\n(11)\n\n\fThis implies, together with Eq. (10), that the information of an outer observer about\na black hole has completely converted into entropy proportional to its horizon area. In\nother words, one can reinterpret Eq. (11), by the assumption (5), as that the information\nhas all been saved on the horizon boundary of the black hole as its entropy. It is clear\nthat Eq. (10) is the limit case of Eq. (5) in above sense. Now that Eq. (10) is believed\nto be valid without depending the dynamical details of interactions [6, 11, 12], one can,\nin principle, assume that it applies for any system with strong gravitational interaction,\nincluding the system of photons.\nIf one inputs energy from outer region into the system through its boundary, the IE\nwithin the system will increase. Then, Eq. (11) indicates that the total IE of an isolated\nsystem(or space-time region) with boundary area A is bounded up by the entropy SBH\nof a black hole with same area of horizon,\nS + I \u2264 SBH =\n\nkB A\n.\n4lp2\n\n(12)\n\nClearly, this agrees with the holographic principle S \u2264 A/4 in Planck unit since information I of an observer about the system can not be negative. The right side of Eq.\n(12) is known as the holographic bound [6]. We know that holographic principle provides\nfor a system an upper bound of information of 1 bit per Planck area Ap = (2lp )2 on its\nboundary. We note here that Eq. (12) has reformulated the holographic principle by\ndivision the IE into two parts S and I explicitly.\nTo see the implication of Eq. (12), we reconsider the case of black hole. From Eq.\n(9) we know that, in order to acquire information from black hole, it is necessary for\nthe outer observer to reduce its entropy, or, equivalently, reduce the area of its horizon.\nThis can be exactly done by the process of Hawking radiation [13]. Hence, in light of the\nformulation (12), the Hawking process will necessarily carry the information out of the\nblack hole which has previously disappeared in it. The black hole information paradox is\nthen eliminated.\nLet us consider, for simplicity, a free particle with mass M. According to the holographic bound (12) there exists a space-time region V enclosing this particle such that\nthe IE of the particle would not be more than that given by the area A of the boundary \u2202V\nof V . Holographic principle implies that V can not be a geometric point since otherwise\nthe IE of this particle will be equal or less that the entropy bound 0 = A/4 , which\ncontradicts with the fact that it has the nonzero IE. In addition, a point-like particle can\nnot be possible since otherwise it appears as a singularity in space-time, which must be\nsurrounded by an even horizon (\u2202V ) to avoid a bare singularity. The radius of this region\nis the lower limit for position observation. Therefore, one has following inequality for the\n4\n\n\fentropy S of the particle\nS\u2264\n\nkB A\n.\n4lp2\n\n(13)\n\nEven if we know nothing about the makeup of the particle we can assume that the\nenergy E = Mc2 of the particle arises from the contributions of its internal degrees of\nfreedom constrained by the bound (13). We can then associate the energy E with a\ntemperature T which corresponds to some unknown motion of these degrees of freedom.\nThis temperature T should be in consistent with the standard relation of entropy in\nRE\nthermodynamics: S = 0 dE/T . Then, it follows from Eq. (13) that\nMc2\nkB A\n,\n\u2264\nT\n4lp2\nor,\nMc2 \u2264 kB T *\n\nA\n.\n4lp2\n\n(14)\n\nFor the internal motion of all degrees of freedom within one-particle system, one can\nestimate that the energy of this system is about M c2 \u2248 kB T . Therefore, Eq. (14) becomes\nA\n\u2265 1,\n4lp2\nor, using lp2 = G~/c3 ,\n\u03c0R2 c3\n4\u03c0R2\n=\n\u2265 1,\n4G~/c3\nG~\n\n(15)\n\nin which R is the characteristic radius of the region V . For an observer who it is going to\nmeasure this particle V is the hidden region and the boundary A = 4\u03c0R2 is the horizon\narea of the particle with mass M. Thus, R should be given by Schwarzschild radius [14]:\nR = 2MG/c2 . If we rewrite Eq. (15) as\nRc2 2\u03c0cR\n*\n\u2265 1.\n2G\n~\nThen, one finds\nRMc \u2265\n\n~\n.\n2\u03c0\n\n(16)\n\nThe fact that region V is hidden for the observer outside implies that the implication of the radius R can be understood as the lower limit of the position measurement\nimplemented by the observer. Therefore, one can identify R as the position uncertainty\nR = \u2206x of the particle with respect to the observer. We also know [14] that the hidden\n5\n\n\fregion V given by Schwarzschild radius is the one that can not be measured even by the\nfastest particles, namely, the photons. Therefore, Mc = Mc2 /c is the most-likely loss\nof the particle momentum during the measuring process since the momentum transfer is\nmaximal for the measurable particle with vanishing rest mass. Hence, Mc \u2248 \u2206p. So, it\nfollows from Eq. (16) that\n~\n.\n(17)\n2\u03c0\nThis is the well-known uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics up to a constant of\norder 1/\u03c0. In spite of the presence of the mystical factor 1/\u03c0 in the relation (17) it is in\nconsistent with the Heisenberg's relation \u2206x\u2206p \u2265 ~/2. Since the validity of Heisenberg's\nrelation is mainly confined in the phenomena with the gravity relatively weak in contrast\nwith other interactions, one can look Eq. (17) as the uncertainty relation that may\ngenerally holds in quantum gravity.\nIn summary, we proposed an ansatz that the sum of information and entropy of an\nisolated system is identically conserved in the process of measurement and evolution of\nthe system, by which the holographic principle was reformulated in terms of the concept\nof the information entropy. It was found that uncertainty principle between position and\nmomentum can be derived from the holographic principle. Therefore, the uncertainty\nrelation in quantum theory is a manifestation of the finiteness of total information that\nan observer can acquire by measuring a system.\n\u2206x * \u2206p \u2265\n\nReferences\n[1] J. von Neumann, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (Princeton\n\nUniversity Press, Princeton 1955).\n[2] T.
