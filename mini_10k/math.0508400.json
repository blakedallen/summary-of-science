We present examples which show that in dimension higher than\none or codimension higher than two, there exist toric ideals IA such that no\nbinomial ideal contained in IA and of the same dimension is a complete intersection. This result has important implications in sparse elimination theory\nand in the study of the Horn system of partial differential equations.\n\n1. Introduction\nGiven a configuration A = {a1 , . . . , an } \u2282 Zm of integral points generating Zm ,\nthe (toric) ideal IA \u2282 C[x1 , . . . , xn ] is generated by all binomials\nxu \u2212 xv ,\nwhose exponents u, v \u2208 Nn satisfy A * u = A * v. Here we are also denoting by A\nthe m \u00d7 n matrix whose j-th column is aj . Note that IA is weighted-homogeneous\nfor every weight w in the row-span of A. We shall assume that (1, . . . , 1) is in the\nrow-span of A and, consequently, that IA is a (standard) homogeneous ideal.\nThe configuration A and its associated toric ideal IA are the central characters\nin several areas of very active research in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry,\nand differential algebra. The associated projective variety XA has a natural action\nof the algebraic torus (C\u2217 )m making it into a projective toric variety of dimension\nd := m \u2212 1. We call d the dimension of A.\nLet LA \u2282 Rn be the lattice\nLA = {v \u2208 Zn : A * v = 0}\nand let r := n \u2212 m be the codimension of A. Let B = {v1 , . . . , vr } \u2282 LA be a\nmaximal set of vectors linearly independent over Q. We also denote by B the n \u00d7 r\nmatrix whose j-th column is vj and consider the binomial ideal JB generated by\n+\n\u2212\nthe binomials xvj \u2212 xvj , where vj = vj+ \u2212 vj+ is the decomposition in positive and\nnegative components.\n\u00b11\nIt has been proven in [8] that JB \u2297 C[x\u00b11\n1 , . . . , xn ] is always a complete intersec\u00b11\ntion in the Laurent polynomial ring, and that it coincides with IA \u2297 C[x\u00b11\n1 , . . . , xn ]\nif and only if the greatest common divisor g of the maximal minors of B satisfies\ng = 1. This positive integer g is precisely the index with respect to LA of the lattice\nspanned by B. We will refer to JB as a basis ideal . Following [14] we will reserve\nthe term lattice basis ideal for the case when B is a Z-basis of LA . Clearly JB \u2282 IA\nand, in general, this containment is proper.\n\u2217\nAMS Subject Classification: Primary 14M10, Secondary 14M25, 13C40\nE.

CURRAN, AND A. DICKENSTEIN\n\nIn this note we study a question which arises naturally in the study of Adiscriminants [7] and of Horn systems of differential equations [6]: does every toric\nideal contain a complete intersection basis ideal (i.e. a complete intersection binomial ideal of the same dimension)? This is indeed the case if XA is a monomial\ncurve (d = 1) or in the codimension two case (r = 2). The purpose of this note is to\nshow that in any dimension higher than one and any codimension higher than two,\nthere exist toric ideals IA such that no basis ideal contained in IA is a complete\nintersection.\n\u2217\nWe recall that the dual variety XA\nof XA is the Zarisky closure of the locus\n\u2217\nof hyperplanes tangent to XA at a smooth point. When XA\nis a hypersurface,\nits defining equation is the A-discriminant. This notion, introduced by Gel'fand,\nKapranov, and Zelevinsky [12], generalizes the classical notion of the discriminant\nof a univariate polynomial. Dickenstein and Sturmfels [7] have shown how to compute A-discriminants for codimension two (i.e. n \u2212 m = 2) configurations. A\nkey ingredient of this work is the fact that every basis ideal in a codimension two\ntoric ideal is a complete intersection. Our results show that a different approach is\nneeded to describe A-discriminants in higher codimensions.\nThe work of Gel'fand et al. on sparse elimination was a step toward the study\nof A-hypergeometric (or GKZ) systems. Consider the \"quantized\" version of the\nideal IA , that is, the left ideal HA (\u03b2) in the Weyl algebra\nDn = Chx1 , . . . , xn , \u22021 , . . . , \u2202n i\ngenerated by the toric operators \u2202 u \u2212 \u2202 v , A * u = A * v together with the Euler\noperators associated with the (C\u2217 )m action:\naj1 x1 \u22021 + * * * + ajn xn \u2202n \u2212 \u03b2j ,\nwhere \u03b2 = (\u03b21 , . . . , \u03b2m ) \u2208 Cd . An A-hypergeometric function of degree \u03b2 is a\nlocally defined (multivalued) holomorphic function Cn annihilated by HA (\u03b2). This\nnotion of hypergeometric functions encompasses most of the classical univariate and\nmultivariate hypergeometric functions. GKZ systems are holonomic for all choices\nof parameters \u03b2, and so in particular, the corresponding spaces of A-hypergeometric\nfunctions are finite dimensional. Another classical multivariable generalization of\nhypergeometric differential equations is given by the Horn systems, which are closely\nrelated to the GKZ systems. A Horn system consists of the Euler operators and only\nthose toric operators coming from a basis ideal JB contained in IA . Dickenstein,\nMatusevich, and Sadykov [6] have shown that, in codimension two, the behavior\nof an A-hypergeometric and that of any of its associated Horn systems is not very\ndifferent. This relies on the fact that such basis ideals are complete intersections.\nHowever, if the basis ideal is not a complete intersection, the Horn system has an\ninfinite dimensional local solution space for all choices of parameters and, thus, is\nnever holonomic. Our examples show that in the general multivariate case, the\nA-hypergeometric and Horn systems have essentially distinct behavior.\nAcknowledgments: We are grateful to Bernd Sturmfels for many helpful conversations and to John Abbott and Lorenzo Robbiano of the CoCoA group for their\nprogramming assistance.

Preliminaries\nThe study of binomial ideals is intimately connected with the study of (affine)\nsemigroup algebras. It is from this perspective, and beginning with the work of\nHerzog [13] and Delorme [5], that the question of classifying complete intersection\nbinomial ideals has been extensively studied by many authors [1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 14,\n15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22]. A combinatorial characterization of these ideals is given\nin [11] in terms of a choice of B and the notion of mixed matrices; that is, matrices\nsuch that every column contains a strictly positive and a strictly negative entry.\nNote that since the columns of the matrix B add up to zero, B is automatically\nmixed. The following result follows from [8, Theorem 2.1] and [11, Theorem 2.3]\n(see also [17, Theorem 2.7]):\nTheorem 2.1. The ideal JB is a complete intersection if and only if for every\nmixed n\u2032 \u00d7 r\u2032 -submatrix B \u2032 \u2282 B we have n\u2032 \u2265 r\u2032 .\nSince a mixed submatrix must contain at least two rows it follows that:\nCorollary 2.2. If r \u2264 2, every basis ideal JB is a complete intersection.\nIt is also easy to prove that if m = 2, i.e. for XA a monomial projective curve,\nthere exists B such that JB is a complete intersection. Indeed, let\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 1 *** 1\n,\n(2.1)\nA =\na1 a2 * * * an\nwhere a1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 an are coprime. Performing a row operation that does not change\nIA , we may assume without loss of generality that a1 = 0 and, therefore all aj \u2265 0.\nConsider now the following choice B of A:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\na3 \u2212 a2 a4 \u2212 a3 * * * an \u2212 an\u22121\n\uf8ec \u2212a3\n\uf8f7\n0\n***\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\na2\n\u2212a4\n***\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n..\n(2.2)\nB = \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n0\n0\na\n3\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n..\n.\n.\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n.\n.\n\u2212an\n.\n0\n0\n***\nan\u22121\n\nSince ai \u2212 ai+1 \u2265 0, it follows that every mixed submatrix of B must contain more\nrows than columns and therefore JB is a complete intersection.\nNote that already in the simplest case of the twisted cubic; i.e. the curve XA\nassociated with:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1 1 1\nA =\n,\n0 1 2 3\nthe toric ideal IA is not a complete intesection but it does contain a complete\nintersection basis ideal.\nGiven a vector v \u2208 Zn we define the support of v:\nsupp(v) := {i \u2208 {1, . . . , n} : vi 6= 0}.\n+\n\nSimilarly we set supp (v) := {i : vi > 0}, supp\u2212 (v) := {i : vi < 0}. If u, v \u2208 Zn\nwe say that u is conformal to v if supp+ (u) \u2282 supp+ (v) and supp\u2212 (u) \u2282 supp\u2212 (v).\nGiven a configuration A = {a1 , . . . , an } \u2282 Zm , a vector v \u2208 LA is called a circuit\nif its support is minimal among all elements in LA relative to inclusion. As shown\n\n\f4\n\nE. CATTANI, R. CURRAN, AND A. DICKENSTEIN\n\nin the proof of [19, Lemma 4.9], if u is a circuit in LA of maximal dimension m\nwith supp(u) = {i1 , . . . , im+1 }, then up to multiple:\n(2.3)\n\nu =\n\nm+1\nX\nj=1\n\n\u0001\n(\u22121)j det aii , . . . , aij\u22121 , aij+1 , . . . , aim+1 eij .\n\nThe following is Lemma 4.10 in [19]:\nLemma 2.3. Every vector v \u2208 LA may be written as a non-negative rational linear\ncombination of n \u2212 m circuits each of which is conformal to v.\nDefinition 2.4. Given a configuration A = {a1 , . . . , an } \u2282 Zm we say that a basis\nideal JB is generated by circuits if and only if each of the column vectors of B is a\ncircuit in LA .\nProposition 2.5. A toric ideal IA contains a complete intersection basis ideal if\nand only if it contains a complete intersection basis ideal generated by circuits.\nProof. Let {v1 , . . . , vr } \u2282 LA be a Q-linearly independent set defining a complete\nintersection basis ideal. Let i \u2208 {1, . . . , r} be the smallest index such that vi is\nnot a circuit. Using Lemma 2.3 write vi as a non-negative rational combination of\ncircuits w1i , . . . , wri :\nvi = q1 w1i + * * * + qr wri .\nClearly, some wji must be linearly independent from {vk , k 6= i}, hence we may\nreplace vi by the circuit wji to obtain a new Q-linearly independent set. Continuing\nin this manner we obtain a linearly independent set {w1 , . . . , wr } consisting of\ncircuits and such that wi is conformal to vi .\nLet B (respectively C) denote the matrix whose columns are the vectors vi\n(respectively wi ). Since wi is conformal to vi it follows that if C \u2032 is a mixed\nsubmatrix of C then the corresponding submatrix B \u2032 of B is also mixed. Hence,\nby Theorem 2.1, if JB is a complete intersection, so is JC .\n\u0003\n3. Toric ideals of dimension at least two\nIn this section we will exhibit examples of configurations in any dimension\nd = m \u2212 1 \u2265 2, which do not contain any complete intersection basis ideal. By\nassumption we may suppose that A \u2282 {1} \u00d7 Zd . By abuse of notation we will\nidentify A with its projection onto Zd .\nTheorem 3.1. Let A be the vertex set of a lattice polytope in Rd and n = |A|.\nThere exists N = N (d) such that, for n \u2265 N , IA does not contain any complete\nintersection basis ideal.\nProof. Let B \u2282 Zn\u00d7(n\u2212m) such that its columns are a Q-basis of the kernel lattice\nLA . Note that every column of B must contain at least two strictly positive and\ntwo strictly negative entries since, otherwise, one of the points in A would be in the\nconvex hull of some of the other points in A and that is impossible by assumption.\nSuppose JB is a complete intersection. It then follows from Theorem 2.1 that\nevery (n \u2212 m \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 m) minor of B must be non-mixed. In other words, for any\nsubset J \u2282 {1, . . . , n}, |J| = m + 1, there exists a column vi of B such that either\nthe positive support supp\u0001+ (vi ) or the negative support supp\u2212 (vi ) is contained in\nn\nJ. Clearly, there are d+2\nindex sets J of cardinality m + 1 = d + 2.\n\n\fCOMPLETE INTERSECTIONS IN TORIC IDEALS\n\n5\n\nNow, for a given vi , its positive support\ncontains at least two indices and therefore\n\u0001\nit may be contained in at most n\u2212d\ndistinct\nfour-index sets J. Thus, since B has\n2\nn \u2212 d \u2212 1 columns and taking into account the positive and negative supports, the\ncondition may be satisfied for at most\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\u22122\n2 (n \u2212 d \u2212 1)\nd\nindex sets J.

In the planar case d = 2, the inequality (3.1) is satisfied for n \u2265 22.\nHowever, it is clear that the estimates above are very rough and that one should\nexpect Theorem 3.1 to hold for n considerably smaller than 22.\nExample 3.3. Consider a configuration {a1 , . . . , a10 } of ten points in Z2 which are\nthe vertices of a polygon. We may assume them to be ordered counterclockwise.\nGiven four indices 1 \u2264 i < j < k < l \u2264 10, there exists a relation\n\u03bbi ai \u2212 \u03bbj aj + \u03bbk ak \u2212 \u03bbl al = 0,\nwhere \u03bbi , \u03bbj , \u03bbk , \u03bbl are positive integers. Such a relation defines a circuit in the\nlattice kernel LA . Using the computer algebra system CoCoA [4], we searched for\nsets of seven such relations satisfying the condition in Theorem 2.1. The following\nis such an example. We have only indicated the sign of the coefficients since that\nis all that matters in Theorem 2.1 and, for generic coefficients, the matrix B will\nbe of maximal rank.\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nB=\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u2212\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n+\n\u2212\n0\n+\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212\n0\n\n+\n0\n0\n\u2212\n0\n0\n0\n+\n\u2212\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+\n\u2212\n+\n0\n0\n\u2212\n\n+\n0\n\u2212\n0\n0\n+\n0\n\u2212\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n+\n0\n\u2212\n+\n0\n0\n0\n\u2212\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n+\n\u2212\n+\n0\n\u2212\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nWe were unable to obtain similar examples with n = 11. We suspect that Theorem 3.1 holds for polygons in the plane with at least 11 vertices.\n4. Toric ideals of codimension at least three\nIt follows from Remark 3.2 that Theorem 3.1 furnishes examples of toric ideals\nwhich do not contain any complete intersection basis ideal in codimension greater\nthan twenty-one. In this section we will describe a different class of examples which\nshow that in every codimension greater than two there exist toric ideals with that\nsame property.\n\n\f6\n\nE. CATTANI, R. CURRAN, AND A. DICKENSTEIN\n\nLet n = m + r, and consider a configuration consisting of the vertices of a cyclic\npolytope (we refer to [23] for other properties of this important class of polytopes):\n\uf8eb\n\n(4.1)\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nA = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n1\nt1\nt21\n..\n.\n\n1\nt2\nt22\n..\n.\n\n***\n***\n***\n\n1\ntn\nt2n\n..\n.\n\ntm\u22121\n1\n\ntm\u22121\n2\n\n***\n\ntm\u22121\nn\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nwhere 0 < t1 < t2 < * * * < tn are integers. For appropriate choices of t1 , . . . , tn , the\ncolumns of A span Zm .\nTheorem 4.1. Let r \u2265 3. For n \u2265 2(r2 \u2212 r + 1) the toric ideal IA associated with\nthe matrix (4.1) does not contain any complete intersection basis ideal.\nProof. According to Proposition 2.5, it suffices to show that IA does not contain\nany complete intersection basis ideal generated by circuits which, up to constant,\nare given by the expression (2.3). On the other hand, note that all maximal minors\nof A are non-zero and the determinant\n\u0001\ndet aii , . . . , aij\u22121 , aij+1 , . . . , aim+1\nis strictly positive since it is the Vandermonde determinant for\ntii < * * * < tij\u22121 < tij+1 < * * * < tim+1 .\nTherefore, if v \u2208 LA is a circuit then it will have exactly r \u2212 1 zero entries while\nthe remaining entries will alternate in sign.\nThis means that if B is an n \u00d7 r matrix whose columns are a circuit basis of LA\nthen each column of B contains exactly r \u2212 1 entries which are zero and B contains\na total of r(r \u2212 1) zero entries. This implies that if n \u2265 2(r2 \u2212 r + 1), B will have to\ncontain two consecutive rows all of whose entries are non-zero. Let B \u2032 denote the\n2 \u00d7 3 submatrix consisting of those two rows. Since the signs of the columns are\nalternating, B \u2032 is mixed and, by Theorem 2.1, JB is not a complete intersection.\nIn fact, if B \u2032 consists of the j-th and k-th rows of B, the codimension two ideal\nhxj , xk i is an associated prime ideal of JB .\n\u0003\nRemark 4.2. For r = 3 the lower bound in Theorem 4.1 is 14. One can show that\nfor n \u2264 11 every toric ideal IA admits a complete intersection basis ideal. We do\nnot know if there are examples of configurations with n = 12 or n = 13 that do not\nadmit any such basis ideals.\nReferences\n[1] M. Barile, M. Morales, and A. Thoma.
