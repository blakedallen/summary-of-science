Thanks to\nthe large binding energy (60 meV) and the small Bohr radius (1.8 nm) of ZnO excitons, the\nachievement of a polariton laser working at room temperature based on the coherent emission\nfrom exciton-polaritons in their ground state is expected [3,4]. A strong coupling regime\n(SCR) up to 410 K [2,5-9] is demonstrated but the lasing threshold is not crossed, mainly due\nto the low photon lifetime. Two different conceptions of ZnO microcavities have been\nreported: all oxide structures with high quality factors but polycrystalline zinc oxide layers [57], or hybrid cavities with a better quality of the active layer but a reduced photonic\nconfinement [2,8-9]. Similar to previous works on GaN-based microcavities [10,11] a third\napproach can be followed using two dielectric mirrors after removal of the substrate used for\nthe epitaxy of the active layer for a high quality factor and a reduced inhomogeneous\nbroadening of the ZnO excitons.\nIn this letter, we present the first realization of a double dielectric mirror epitaxial\nZnO-based microcavity working in the strong coupling regime. We first describe the growth\nprocess and the achievement of SCR at room temperature. The suppression of the bottleneck\neffect in the lower polariton branch at a low power density appears as proof of a long\npolaritonic lifetime.\nThe cavity structure is given in Fig. 1(a). First, a high-quality half-wavelength (\u03bb/2)\nlayer of ZnO was grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) on a 3 AlN/(Al,Ga)N pair stack\ngrown by MBE on a (111) Si substrate. On the top of the ZnO layer, a 3.5-pair SiO2/SiNx\ndielectric Bragg reflector (DBR) was deposited by radio-frequency -plasma-enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) and completed by a 200-nm-thick aluminum layer\n(theoretical reflectivity: 98.5%). The obtained structure was then bonded onto a Pyrex plate\nand the silicon substrate was subsequently removed by chemical etching terminated by SF6/O2\n\n2\n\n\finductively coupled plasma etching. The first AlN layer is used as an etch-stop during the\nremoval step of the silicon substrate. Finally, a 10-pair SiO2/SiNx top Bragg mirror was\ndeposited by RF-PECVD in place of the silicon substrate.\nAngle resolved reflectivity (R) and photoluminescence (PL) experiments were\nperformed at low (5 K) and room temperature with incidence angles from 2\u00b0 to 85\u00b0\n(resolution < 1\u00b0). A halogen lamp is used for reflectivity. A 266 nm continuous wave (cw)\nlaser is focused on a 300-\u03bcm-diameter spot (macro-PL measurements) and is adjustable from\n2 to 20 \u03bcm for \u03bc-PL though a UV objective (numerical aperture 0.4).\nPrior to the deposition of the last dielectric mirror, the PL spectrum of the half cavity\nafter Si etching was recorded at 10 K (Fig. 1(b)). An intense luminescence associated to\nneutral donor bound excitons in ZnO is observed at about 3.36 eV [12] whereas the peak at\n3.90 eV corresponds to the excitonic luminescence of (Al,Ga)N [13]. Indeed, neither the\nquality of the ZnO layer nor that of the AlGaN of the nitride stack is affected by the removal\nof the substrate. Two photonic modes are also observed on the low energy side of the\nspectrum.\nThe quality factor of the complete cavity has been measured far from the ZnO\nexcitonic energies in order to assess the linewidth of the uncoupled cavity mode. Using\nmacro-PL excitation conditions, a quality factor (Q) of 150 is obtained, far from the\ntheoretical prediction (Q=900) based on transfer matrix simulations, which consider solely a\nhomogeneous broadening of the cavity mode. The Q-value measured by macro-PL is strongly\nreduced with respect to the theoretical one due to thickness fluctuations both in the active\nregion and in the DBRs [14]. In our case, thickness fluctuations due to the inhomogeneous\nand incomplete removal of the Si substrate can further contribute to the inhomogeneous\nbroadening. Indeed, a mapping of the cavity mode energy (Fig. 1(c)) shows that the spatial\ninhomogeneities occur at the scale of 2-10 \u03bcm. Thus, by reducing the \u03bcPL spot diameter to 2\n\n3\n\n\f\u03bcm we were able to differentiate extended areas where Q reaches 675, close to the theoretical\nvalue (Fig. 1(d)).\nAngle-resolved reflectivity measurements recorded at room temperature in TM\npolarization (i.e., with the electric field parallel to the incidence plane) for an incidence angle\nfrom 5\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 are reported in Fig. 2(a). On the upper spectrum (5\u00b0), two features are\nobserved: the optical cavity mode at 3200\u00b11 meV negatively detuned and the broad excitonic\ntransition at 3310\u00b110 meV. With increasing incidence angle, the cavity mode moves towards\nthe exciton energy and the SCR is evidenced by the anticrossing of the two modes. The\nresonance is observed at 35\u00b0 and the Rabi splitting (\u03a9) is equal to 42\u00b15 meV. Due to the\ncurrent cavity design, the electric field is more intense in the nitride stack than in the ZnO\nactive layer and consequently the Rabi splitting is smaller than could be expected for a\nconventional \u03bb/2 thick ZnO layer. A second anticrossing is also observed between the LPB\nand the Bragg polariton (BP) between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0 (\u03a9=30\u00b15 meV). The reflectivity\nmeasurements at 5 K (not shown here) also exhibit the SCR with a Rabi splitting equal to\n55\u00b14 meV in TM polarization. The increase of the Rabi splitting at low temperature can be\nsimply explained by the reduction of the exciton linewidth, which approaches that of the\nphotonic mode [15]. The detection at 5 K of A, B, and C excitons at 3376\u00b13, 3382\u00b13, and\n3427\u00b12 meV, respectively, in agreement with previous measurements [8], confirms the high\nquality of the active layer. The dispersion of the polaritonic modes deduced from reflectivity\n(solid squares) and PL (open circles) data at 300 K is plotted in Fig. 2(b). A very good\nagreement is found between both measurements. The quasiparticle (QP) model is used to\ncalculate the polaritonic dispersion curves and the photonic and excitonic compositions of the\nmodes [16]. Three quasiparticles are considered in the current cavity: the cavity (cav) and\nBragg (b) modes, as well as one excitonic transition (exc), which accounts for A and B ZnO\nexcitons, as they cannot be individually resolved at room temperature. Optical modes interact\n\n4\n\n\fwith the exciton through coupling terms called Vcav and Vb. The damping terms of the\noscillators associated with these quasiparticles and deduced from the analysis of the\nreflectivity spectra are \u0393exc=50 meV, \u0393cav=21 meV, and \u0393b=54 meV. In Fig. 2(b), the dotted\nlines represent the uncoupled excitonic transition and the dispersion of the photonic modes\nwhereas the solid lines correspond to the calculations using the QP model. The coupling terms\n(Vcav and Vb) deduced from the simulation, 22 and 14 meV, respectively, are consistent with\nthe expected values (since \u03a9~2V).\nThe macro-PL (illuminating spot of 300 \u03bcm in diameter) of the cavity has been\nrecorded as a function of the emission angle (\u03b8) - with respect to the normal direction of the\nsample \u2013 for various excitation powers. The integrated intensity of the LPB measured for\nthree laser intensities is divided by the corresponding value of the laser intensity (16, 40, and\n170 W/cm2). Taking into account the photonic character of the LPB previously calculated\n(Fig. 2(c)), it is possible to determine the polariton distribution within the LPB, which is\nrepresented in Fig. 3(a). At low excitation intensity (16 W/cm2) the polariton distribution is\nmaximum at about 18\u00b0 due to the so-called bottleneck effect, which prevents thermalization\nof polaritons towards the k=0 low energy states. In this configuration, the relaxation time (\u03c4rel)\nis probably larger than the polariton lifetime (\u03c4pol) given that the photonic lifetime, which in\nthe current situation is limiting the overall polariton lifetime, equals 0.03 ps due to the large\nspatial inhomogeneities [17]. Under an excitation power of 40 W/cm2, this bottleneck can be\novercome and the polariton distribution is approximatively constant whatever the emission\nangle. The suppression of the bottleneck can be attributed to the increase of the polaritonpolariton scattering, which is more efficient when more polaritons are created [18, 19]. For\nthe largest excitation power (170 W/cm2), polaritons not only relax more efficiently towards\nk=0 but also leak into the BP branch, as observed in ref. 18.\n\n5\n\n\fHowever, due to the spatial inhomogeneities of the Q-factor (i.e., of the photon\nlifetime), the macro-PL signal, and consequently the observed relaxation in Fig. 3(a), is\naveraged over regions of very different optical properties (regions of different Q-values and of\ndifferent detunings, as illustrated by the blue spectrum in Fig. 1(d)). In order to get rid of this\naveraging, the luminescence of the cavity was also recorded as a function of the emission\nangle through Fourier imaging by using a microscope objective which allows us to collect PL\nemission up to 20\u00b0. The advantage of this method lies in the fact that it allows to investigate\nthe angular dependence of the emission within small areas that are more homogeneous with\nrespect to the cavity finesse. A region 20 \u03bcm in diameter was investigated and the results are\nreported in Figs. 3(b) and 3(c) for excitation intensities equal to 4.5 and 400 W/cm2,\nrespectively. The emission patterns are similar in both cases, with no bottleneck observable\neven at the lowest excitation intensity, a situation radically different to the one observed by\nmacro-PL. With this spot diameter (20 \u03bcm), Q is found to be equal to 300 (photon\nlifetime=0.06 ps), i.e., twice as large as in the macro-PL measurements. It is noteworthy that\neven though the spectra in Fig. 3(b) and 3(c) were recorded at a position of larger negative\ndetuning (-120 meV) than those in Fig. 3(a) and, therefore, with a larger \u03c4rel, polaritons are\nthermalized at k=0, pointing clearly towards a polariton lifetime that is now equal to or larger\nthan \u03c4rel [17]. Thus, when the investigated area is homogeneous in Q and with a Q-value\nlarger than its mean value (Figs. 3(b) and 3(c)), efficient relaxation towards k=0 can be easily\nobtained (even at low excitation intensities), this being a necessary condition for polariton\ncondensation. Unfortunately the polariton lifetime, mainly determined by its photonic\nlifetime, was still too short to enable polariton condensation.\n\nIn conclusion, we have fabricated an epitaxial ZnO microcavity embedded between two\ndielectric mirrors and studied its optical properties. This approach exploits the etching\n\n6\n\n\fselectivity between silicon and nitrides, and allows us to increase the quality factor of the\ncavity while maintaining a high optical quality of the active layer. However, as evidenced by\n\u03bc-PL experiments at room temperature, the cavity Q is spatially inhomogeneous on a scale of\nseveral micrometers. Larger excitation power densities are therefore required in order to\novercome the bottleneck effect when exciting larger regions, as compared to the spatial scale\nof the Q inhomogeneities. Finally, efficient polariton relaxation towards k=0 could be\naccomplished at room temperature in regions several micrometers in diameter at low\nexcitation intensities.\n\nThe authors acknowledge G.

(a) Sketch of the full hybrid ZnO microcavity (after processing). (b)\nPhotoluminescence (T=10 K, 244 nm cw excitation) of the structure after Si removal and\nbefore the deposition of the top DBR. (c) Energy mapping in a small area (30 \u03bcm) using a cw\n266 nm laser (d) Micro-photoluminescence (spot of 2 \u03bcm in diameter) at 300 K recorded on a\nregion of homogeneous Q and cavity mode energy (red spectrum) and at the boundary\nbetween two regions of different Q and cavity mode energy values (blue spectrum).\n\nFig. 2. (a) Evolution of angle-resolved reflectivity from 5\u00b0 to 70\u00b0 recorded in TM polarization\nat room temperature. (b) Dispersion of the polaritonic modes deduced from reflectivity (solid\nsquares) and photoluminescence (open circles) data. The solid lines correspond to the\ncalculation using the QP model; dotted lines correspond to the uncoupled modes and the\nexcitonic dispersion. (c) Angular dependence of the eigenstate composition of the LPB\ncalculated within the QP model. Note that the excitonic part is rather small below 20\u00b0\n(negative detuning) and beyond 50\u00b0 (positive detuning, due to the arrival of the Bragg mode).\n\nFig. 3. (a) Distribution of the polaritons in the LPB is deduced from angle-resolved macrophotoluminescence (spot of 300 \u03bcm in diameter) at 300 K for different excitation powers (16,\n40, and 170 W/cm2). (b,c) Images of the angular dispersion of the LPB with a cw 266 nm\nlaser focused on a 20 \u03bcm diameter spot for two excitation intensities of 4.5 and 400 W/cm2.\n\n10\n\n\fPL intensity\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nZnO\n\nPhotonic modes\n\nAlGaN\nHalf-cavity\nafter Si removal\nmacro-PL, T=10K\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nEnergy (eV)\n3.180\n\n20\n\n(c)\n3.190\n\nY Axis (\u03bcm)\n\n15\n3.201\n\n10\n3.211\n\n5\n\n3.217\n\nMode energy (eV)\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nX Axis (\u03bcm)\n\n(d)\n\nPL intensity\n\nFull cavity, T=300 K\n\u03bcPL (\u03bb=266 nm)\n\u03c6spot=2 \u03bcm\n\n0\n\n3.16\n\n3.18\n\nQ=675\n\n3.20\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFigure 1\n\n11\n\n3.22\n\n3.24\n\n\f(a)\n\n(b)\n\nTM, T=300 K\n\nReflectivity, TM\nPhotoluminescence\nSimulation (QP model)\n\nReflectivity\n\n5\u00b0\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n3.6\n\n3.4\n\nUPB\n\n3.2\n\nLPB\nBP\n\nT=300K\n\n70\u00b0\n3.2\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n3.8\n\nEigenstate composition\n\n3.0\n1.0\n\n(c)\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\nCalculation\nusing the QP\nmodel for\nthe LPB\n\nCavity photon\nExciton\nBragg photon\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nIncidence angle (\u00b0)\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFigure 2\n\n12\n\n60\n\n70\n\n\fLower polariton distribution\n\n(a)\n\n16 W/cm2\n40 W/cm2\n\n170 W/cm2\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nEmission angle (\u00b0)\n\n(b) 4.5 W/cm2\n\n(c) 400 W/cm2\n\n3.26\n\n3820\n3.24\n3840\n3.22\n3860\n3.2\n3880\n3.18\n\n3900\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20 -20\n\nEmission angle (\u00b0)\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nEmission angle (\u00b0)\n\nFigure 3\n\n13\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nWavelength (\u00c5)\n\n3800\n\n\f"}
