Box 296, Epping, NSW 1710, Australia\nABSTRACT\nWe describe a new estimate of the radio galaxy 1.4GHz luminosity function and its\nevolution at intermediate redshifts (z \u223c 0.4). Photometric redshifts and color selection\nhave been used to select BJ < 23.5 early-type galaxies from the Panoramic Deep Fields,\na multicolor survey of two 25\u2737\u25e6 fields. Approximately 230 radio galaxies have then\nbeen selected by matching early-type galaxies with NVSS radio sources brighter than\n5mJy. Estimates of the 1.4GHz luminosity function of radio galaxies measure significant\nevolution over the observed redshift range. For an \u03a9M = 1 cosmology the evolution of\nthe radio power is consistent with luminosity evolution where P (z) \u223c P (0)(1 + z)kL and\n3 < kL < 5. The observed evolution is similar to that observed for U V X and X-ray\nselected AGN and is consistent with the same physical process being responsible for the\noptical and radio luminosity evolution of AGN.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - galaxies: evolution - galaxies: luminosity function\n- radio continuum\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvolution of radio sources is required to explain the observed number of radio sources and the\nredshift distribution of radio sources with observed optical counterparts (Longair 1966; Condon\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1984; Peacock 1985). Radio emission from high redshift AGN is detectable in wide-field radio sky\nsurveys and the optical counterparts of some z > 3 radio-loud QSOs can be detected on Schmidt\nphotographic plates. However, most radio-loud AGN are radio galaxies and at z \u223c 0.5 their faint\noptical counterparts (BJ \u223c 23) make it difficult to obtain the large spectroscopic samples required\nto measure the evolution of the luminosity function.\nSeveral previous samples of radio galaxies with redshifts are summarized in Table 1. To date,\nmost estimates of the radio galaxy luminosity function have relied on catalogues limited to bright\nradio flux limits (Kuehr et al. 1981; Wall and Peacock 1985; Dunlop et al. 1989) or bright optical\nflux limits (Condon 1989; Sadler et al. 1989; Machalski and Condon 1999). These catalogues contain\nrelatively few radio galaxies (as opposed to radio-loud QSOs) at z > 0.2, and consequently shed\nlittle light on the radio galaxy luminosity function and its evolution at these redshifts. Samples\nthat have attempted to extend our knowledge of the radio galaxy luminosity function at z >\n\u223c 0.2, by\nextending the identification of mJy radio sources to faint optical magnitudes (B > 22) have been\nlimited to relatively small samples of objects (10-60 galaxies) due to the difficultly of obtaining\nfollow-up spectroscopy. As a result, estimates of the radio galaxy luminosity function and evolution\nobtained from these samples are still subject to significant uncertainty.\nWith photometric redshifts and color selection, it is possible select and estimate the redshifts of\nfaint early-type galaxies in multicolor imaging surveys (Brown et al. 2000). By matching early-type\ngalaxies with sources from the radio catalogues, it is possible to compile a large uniformly selected\ncatalogue of radio galaxies to measure the evolution of the radio galaxy luminosity function. As\nthe radio galaxies are selected from deep wide-field imaging data, a large catalogue of radio-quiet\ngalaxies is also available to measure the environments of the radio galaxies (Brown et al. 2001).\n\n2.\n\nThe Panoramic Deep Fields\n\nThe Panoramic Deep Fields (Brown 2000) are 5\u25e6 \u00d7 5\u25e6 images of the South Galactic Pole (SGP)\nand UK Schmidt field 855 (F855). The images were produced by stacking SuperCOSMOS scans\nof UK Schmidt photographic plates in U , BJ , R and I bands. Object detection, instrumental\nphotometry and faint object star-galaxy classifications were determined with SExtractor (Bertin\nand Arnouts 1996). Photometric calibration of the data was determined with CCD images and\npublished photometry with corrections for dust extinction being derived from the dust maps of\nSchlegel et al. (1998). The final galaxy catalogues are complete to BJ \u223c 23.5 and R \u223c 22. Brown\n(2000) provides a detailed description of the data reduction and calibration of the Panoramic Deep\nFields.\nPhotometric redshifts were calibrated using the polynomial fitting method of Connolly et al.\n(1995) and \u223c 700 Panoramic Deep Field galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from the\nNED database (Brown et al. 2000). Comparison of the photometric redshifts of radio galaxies with\nspectroscopic redshifts showed that radio galaxy redshifts were systematically underestimated by\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\u223c 15%. This is almost certainly due to radio galaxies being more luminous and having slightly\nbluer colors than other early-type galaxies (Sadler et al. 1989; Govoni et al. 2000) To correct for\nthis, the photometric redshifts of radio galaxies in this paper were increased by 15% and Figure 2\nshows there is good agreement between the corrected photometric and spectroscopic redshifts.\n\n3.\n\nSelection of Radio Galaxies\n\nThe radio galaxy sample consists of Panoramic Deep Field galaxies which are associated with\nobjects in the NVSS source catalogue (Condon et al. 1998). BJ \u2212 R color and photometric redshifts\nwere used to select BJ < 23.5 galaxies which are redder than a non-evolving Sbc where the Sbc\ncolors were determined with the k\u2212corrections of Coleman et al. (1980). The optical galaxies were\nthen matched to radio sources from the NVSS source catalog. The selection of early-type galaxies\nremoves contamination of the radio galaxy sample by QSOs and starbursts. If unified models\nof radio-loud AGN (Barthel 1989) are valid, the removal of QSOs from the sample removed radio\ngalaxies viewed at certain orientations. However, as the galaxy photometric redshifts are not usable\nfor QSOs, the removal of QSOs from the sample allowed the measurement of radio galaxy evolution\nwithout spectroscopic redshifts.\nAs the evolution of the radio galaxy population was studied, the criterion used for matching\nradio and optical sources could not be a function of redshift. High completeness was also required to\nprevent the estimate of the luminosity function being dominated by corrections for incompleteness.\nLow contamination of the sample was required so estimates of the luminosity function and radio\ngalaxy environments would not be dominated by galaxies not associated with radio sources.\nThe brightest NVSS source catalogue positions have 1\u03c3 error estimates of \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 while the\n\u2032\u2032\nfaintest (\u223c 2.5mJy) source positions have errors of >\n\u223c 10 (Condon et al. 1998). The sky surface\ndensity of BJ < 23.5 galaxies which meet the color selection selection criterion is \u223c 0.5/\u2737\u2032 so >\n\u223c 40%\nof \u223c 2.5mJy sources have an unassociated optical galaxy within 3\u03c3 of the radio source position. To\nprevent the catalogue being dominated by spurious matches to faint radio sources, the radio flux\nlimit was set to 5mJy which is slightly brighter than completeness limit of the NVSS catalogue.\nThe Panoramic Deep Fields contain \u223c 9 \u00d7 104 early-type galaxies and \u223c 104 radio sources\nmaking the manual selection of radio galaxies prohibitively time consuming. An obvious automated criterion for selecting optical counterparts to radio sources is to match objects within \u223c 3\u03c3\nof the radio source centroid. However, as many extragalactic radio sources have extended emission,\nthis will be incomplete for a significant fraction of radio sources. Selection criterion using only the\nangular separation between radio and optical sources can select a large fraction of all radio sources.\nHowever, for a fixed angular scale, the projected distance increases with redshift introducing selection effects which are a function of redshift. Large radio sources will be excluded at low redshift\nbut will be included at high redshift where the angular size of the radio sources is less than the\nselection criterion.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAs the optical counterparts of radio sources are physical associations, a selection criterion based\non the physical separation of the optical and radio sources can be used to select radio galaxies.\nWhile the NVSS catalogue does not contain redshift information, photometric redshifts can be\nused to estimate the redshifts of optical galaxies and the projected distance between the optical\nand radio sources. As the size (in physical coordinates) of radio sources does not rapidly evolve\nbetween z \u223c 1 and z \u223c 0 (Buchalter et al. 1998), a selection criterion using a fixed projected\ndistance should not introduce selection effects which are a function of redshift.\nTo determine the projected distance used as the selection criterion for optical counterparts,\nthe distribution of projected distances between NVSS sources and optical galaxies within 30\u2032\u2032 of\nNVSS sources was measured and is plotted in Figure 1. The number of optical counterparts declines\nrapidly on scales < 20h\u22121 kpc (h \u00d7 100kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 \u2261 H0 ) after which the distribution has a long\ntail. Approximately 25% of the NVSS sources with early-type galaxies within 30\u2032\u2032 have more than\none early-type counterpart which is consistent with much of the tail in Figure 1 being contamination.\nTo reduce the contamination, optical galaxies > 20h\u22121 kpc from NVSS sources were excluded from\nthe radio galaxy sample. A complete list of the radio galaxy sample is provided in Table 2.\nThe completeness of the selection criterion was estimated by applying the 20h\u22121 kpc criterion\nto radio galaxies from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey identified by Machalski and Condon\n(1999). Approximately 85% of radio galaxies identified by Machalski and Condon (1999) were\nselected with the 20h\u22121 kpc criterion. Fluxes in the NVSS source catalogue are estimated by fitting\nelliptical Gaussians to the radio emission and for \u223c 5% of radio galaxies where the fits are poor, the\nfluxes disagree with Machalski and Condon (1999) by > 5%. At z < 0.05, an increasing fraction\nof radio galaxies have radio emission resolved into multiple components by the NVSS resulting in\n\u223c 50% of radio galaxies having source catalogue flux estimates which disagree with Machalski and\nCondon (1999).\nWhile contamination is low with the 20h\u22121 kpc selection criterion, it is still present in the radio\ngalaxy catalogue. To prevent these objects from biasing the estimate of the luminosity function,\na control sample was constructed by randomly repositioning the radio sources and matching them\nto the galaxy catalogue. This process was repeated 10 times so the control sample size was large\nenough to not be a significant source of noise in the estimate of the luminosity function.\nApproximately 2% of radio sources with optical counterparts have 2 optical counterparts resulting in ambiguous redshift estimates. As this is a small fraction of the total catalogue, rejecting\nthese objects from the radio galaxy and control samples only reduced the completeness of the sample by 4% and did not significantly bias estimates of the evolution of radio galaxies. The estimates\nof the space density and luminosity function parameters were renormalized to account for the 2%\nof radio galaxies removed from the catalogue. The final catalogue of radio galaxies contains 230\nobjects while the control sample (generated with 10 times as many radio sources) contains 229\nobjects.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n4.\n\nRedshift Distribution\n\nThe BJ and R Hubble diagrams for the optical counterparts of NVSS sources are shown in\nFigure 3. There is a strong correlation between redshift and magnitude though this is partially due\nto the use of photometric redshifts which result in objects with the same multicolor photometry\nhaving the same redshift estimate. The R band Hubble diagram shows evidence of incompleteness\nat z > 0.55 due to the BJ magnitude limit. As the apparent magnitude of a MBJ \u223c \u221220 elliptical at\nz \u223c 0.55 is BJ \u223c 23, this is not unexpected. As the incompleteness at z > 0.55 could significantly\nbias estimates of radio galaxy evolution, the sample was limited to redshifts z < 0.55. At low\nredshifts, the errors of the photometric redshifts are comparable to the redshift estimates resulting\nin large errors for the estimates of the radio power. To prevent these objects from introducing errors\ninto the estimate of the luminosity function, only the 196 radio galaxies with 0.10 < z < 0.55 were\nused to estimate the luminosity function. The redshift distributions of the radio galaxy sample,\nthe Parkes selected regions(Dunlop et al. 1989) and Phoenix(Hopkins et al. 1998) are shown in\nFigure 4. The size of the Panoramic Deep Fields results in an improved estimate of the radio\ngalaxy luminosity function at z \u223c 0.4 and the broad redshift distribution has allowed the evolution\nof z < 0.55 radio galaxies to be measured.\n\n5.\n\nColor Distribution\n\nThe color selection criterion applied to the radio galaxy candidates will affect the sample\ncompleteness at some level. If a large fraction of radio galaxies have colors bluer than the selection\ncriterion, significant uncertainty is introduced into estimates of the luminosity function and its\nevolution. The colors of galaxies in the radio galaxy sample are shown as a function of redshift in\nFigure 5. While most radio galaxies have red colors, some do have colors similar to the selection\ncriterion. However, this could be due to contamination which is comprised mostly of blue galaxies\nwhich dominate the faint galaxy population.\nThe estimated restframe colors of the radio galaxy sample are plotted in Figure 6. Restframe\ncolors were estimated with linear extrapolations from the E and Sbc k\u2212corrections from Coleman\net al. (1980). The peak of the distribution is \u223c 0.2 magnitudes redder than the BJ \u2212 R = 1.01\nselection criterion. For comparison, the distribution of radio galaxy colors from Govoni et al. (2000)\nis also shown. If Govoni et al. (2000) sample is representative of all radio galaxies, then \u223c 85% of\nradio galaxies were selected by the color selection criterion. However, the distributions in Figure 6\nare not identical and a systematic \u03b4(BJ \u2212 R) = 0.1 difference between the Govoni et al. (2000)\nand Panoramic Deep Field colors could alter the completeness by \u223c 10%. For the remainder of the\npaper, the incompleteness due to the color selection criterion is assumed to be 15%.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n6.\n\nThe 1.4 GHz Luminosity Function\n\nThe restframe radio power of the sources was estimated with\nlogP1.4 (WHz\u22121 ) = logS1.4 (mJy) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1r )log(1 + z) + 2logDl (Mpc) + 17.185\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S1.4 is the observed 1.4GHz radio flux, Dl is the luminosity distance and \u03b1r is the radio\nspectral index which is assumed to be 0.7. The radio luminosity function was estimated with\n\u03a6(P1.4 ) =\n\nX\ni\n\n1\nVmax,i\n\n(2)\n\n(Schmidt 1968) where Vmax,i is the maximum comoving volume in which the ith source would be\nincluded in the sample. The value of Vmax,i is given by\nZ zmax\nc\ndVc\nVmax,i = \u03a9\u03b7i\ndz\n(3)\nH0 zmin dz\nwhere \u03a9 is the survey area, \u03b7i is the completeness of the survey for sources with the properties of\nsource i, zmin and zmax are the minimum and maximum redshifts where source i would be included\nin the sample and Vc is the comoving volume. The values of zmin and zmax were set by the bright\nand faint flux limits (optical and radio) for the sample and the lower and upper limits for the\nredshifts over which the luminosity function is determined.\nThe radio luminosity function of radio galaxies for 0.10 < z < 0.30 and 0.30 < z < 0.55 is\nshown in Figure 7 and listed in Table 3. To be consistent with previous work, the estimates of\nthe luminosity function have been determined with \u03a9M = 1 and H0 = 100kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The\n0.10 < z < 0.30 space density is comparable to the low redshift samples of Sadler et al. (1989)\nand Machalski and Godlowski (2000) at P1.4 > 1023 WHz\u22121 . Machalski and Godlowski (2000) may\nsuffer incompleteness at P1.4 < 1023 WHz\u22121 as their estimate of the space density decreases with\ndecreasing radio power. The space density of 0.30 < z < 0.55 radio galaxies is significantly higher\nthan the low redshift samples which is consistent with evolution occurring over the observed redshift\nrange.\nTo measure the evolution of the radio galaxy luminosity function, the data was been fitted\nwith a 2 power-law function\n\u03a6(P )d(logP ) = C\n\n\u2217\n\n\"\u0012\n\nP \u2217 (z)\nP\n\n\u0013\u03b1\n\n+\n\n\u0012\n\nP \u2217 (z)\nP\n\n\u0013\u03b2 #\u22121\n\nd(logP )\n\n(4)\n\n(Boyle et al. 1988; Dunlop and Peacock 1990). The evolution of the luminosity function was\nassumed to be pure luminosity evolution where\nP \u2217 (z) = P \u2217 (0)(1 + z)kL\n\n(5)\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n(Boyle et al. 1988). The best-fit values for the C \u2217 , P \u2217 (0), \u03b1, \u03b2 and kL were obtained by minimizing\nS = \u22122lnL\n\n(6)\n\n(Marshall et al. 1983) where L is the likelihood. The value of S is given by\nS = \u22122\n\nNrg\nX\ni=1\n\nln[\u03a6(P, zi )] + 2f\n\nNc\nX\ni=1\n\nln[\u03a6(P, zi )] + 2\n\nZ Z\n\n\u03a6(P, z)\u03a9(P, z)\n\ndV\ndzdP\ndz\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Nrg is the number of radio galaxies in the sample, Nc is the number of control objects and f\nis the number of radio sources used to produce the radio galaxy catalogue divided by the number of\nradio sources used to generate the control catalogue. Error estimates for the measured parameters\nwere determined by computing \u2206S for each parameter in turn while allowing the other values\nfor the parameters to float (Lampton et al. 1976; Boyle et al. 1988). The errors quoted for the\nremainder of the paper were determined for \u2206S = 1 which is equivalent to 1\u03c3. The goodness-of-fit\nof the model was tested using the 2D Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) statistic described by Peacock\n(1983).\nThe best-fit estimate of the luminosity function is shown in Figure 8 and the estimates of\nluminosity function parameters and the KS probability are listed in Table 4. To allow comparison\nwith low redshift samples, the radio power of sources used to estimate the space density have been\ndivided by the estimate of the luminosity evolution. The luminosity function model is comparable\nto estimates of the luminosity function at low redshift. Also, as shown in Figure 4, the model is a\ngood approximation to the observed redshift distribution of Panoramic Deep Field radio galaxies.\nThe estimates of the luminosity function parameters are affected by Malmquist bias due to\nerrors in the radio flux and redshift estimates. To correct for this, artificial datasets of radio galaxies\nwere generated using 2 power-law functions. The fluxes and redshifts were then scattered assuming\ntheir error distributions can be approximated by Gaussians. The distribution of 1\u03c3 values for the\nradio flux error distribution were determined using the error estimates provided by the NVSS source\ncatalogue. For the photometric redshifts, the errors were estimated by computing the rms of the\ndifference between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts as a function of redshift for early-type\ngalaxies. The parameters which reproduced the observed luminosity function are listed in Table 4.\nWith the exception of \u03b2, most parameters changed by <\n\u223c 1\u03c3 and as shown in Figure 8, the estimate\nof the luminosity function at z \u223c 0 is comparable the original estimate.\nThe estimate of the luminosity function and its evolution assumes that the radio galaxy catalogue is dominated by steep spectrum radio sources which is consistent with previous estimates\nof the luminosity function (Dunlop and Peacock 1990). However, if a significant fraction of the\nradio galaxy catalogue are flat-spectrum sources, a smaller value of \u03b1r would be more appropriate\nfor estimating the radio powers and the luminosities of the z \u223c 0.5 radio galaxies would be significantly decreased. However, as shown in Table 4, decreasing the value of \u03b1r to 0.5 only decreases\nthe estimate of kL by \u223c 1\u03c3.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe estimates of the luminosity evolution are comparable to previous estimates of the evolution\nof radio-loud AGN including QSOs (Dunlop and Peacock 1990). The similarity of radio-loud\nQSO and radio galaxy evolution is consistent with the unified theory of radio-loud AGN (Barthel\n1989) where radio-loud QSOs and radio galaxies are the same class of object observed at different\norientations. The radio evolution of radio galaxies is also similar to the evolution of radio-quiet AGN\nin the optical and X-ray (Boyle et al. 1988, 1994), starburst galaxies in the radio (Rowan-Robinson\net al. 1993) and the star formation rate in the UV (Lilly et al. 1996).\nWhile the similarity of the luminosity function and its evolution to previous work is not unexpected, it does confirm the ability of the techniques used in this work to estimate the radio galaxy\nluminosity function. If the color selection and photometric redshifts are used to select radio galaxies\nfrom deep 4-m imaging, it will be possible to accurately measure the decline of the z > 4 radio-loud\nAGN luminosity function with redshift and place constraints on the epoch of formation of AGN.\nThe same techniques will also allow wide-field surveys to improve estimates of the z \u223c 0.2 radio\ngalaxy luminosity function, clustering and environments.\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nThe Panoramic Deep Fields and the NVSS have been used to compile a catalogue of BJ < 23.5\nradio galaxies. In this paper we report a new estimate of the radio galaxy luminosity function at\nz > 0.1 based on this sample. Radio fluxes, multicolor photometry and photometric redshifts have\nbeen used to select 230 radio galaxies over 50\u2737\u25e6 . By matching radio sources to optical counterparts\nwith selection criterion that are a function of projected distance, radio galaxies are selected with\nhigh completeness without introducing a strong bias as a function of redshift. There is significant\nevolution of the radio galaxy luminosity function at z < 0.55 which can be parameterized by\nluminosity evolution where P (z) \u223c P (0)(1+z)kL where 3 < kL < 5. The observed evolution of radio\ngalaxies is consistent with the same physical process being responsible for the evolution of radio\ngalaxies and radio-quiet AGN. As the estimate of the luminosity function does not require large\nnumbers of spectroscopic redshifts, it will be possible to apply the same techniques to multicolor\nsurveys where the time required to obtain large numbers spectroscopic redshifts is prohibitive.\n\n8.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors wish to thank the SuperCOSMOS unit at Royal Observatory Edinburgh for\nproviding the digitized scans of UK Schmidt photographic plates.
