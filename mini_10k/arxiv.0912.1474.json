It is caused by a beautiful description of toric varieties in terms of\nconvex geometry. Actual efforts to generalize such a description to other classes of objects\nare very natural. Let us recall that an irreducible normal algebraic variety X is called toric\nif there is a regular action of an algebraic torus T on X with an open orbit, see, for example, [11]. This definition can be generalized in different ways. One possibility is to consider\narbitrary torus actions on algebraic varieties. Recently a semi-combinatorial description of\nsuch actions in terms of so-called polyhedral divisors living on varieties of smaller dimension\nwas introduced in [1] and [2]. Another variant is to restrict the (complex) algebraic torus\naction on a toric variety to the maximal compact subtorus (S 1 )n , to axiomatize this class of\n(S 1 )n -actions, and to consider such actions on wider classes of topological spaces. This is an\nactive research area called Toric Topology, see [7]. Further, one may consider algebraic actions\nwith an open orbit replacing the torus T with a non-abelian connected reductive algebraic\ngroup G. The study of generically transitive G-actions leads to the theory of equivariant\nembeddings of homogeneous spaces G/H, where H is an algebraic subgroup of G. This\ntheory is well-developed. In particular, there are classes of homogeneous spaces with combinatorial description of embeddings. These are the so-called spherical homogeneous spaces\nor, more generally, homogeneous spaces of complexity not exceeding one. The description of\nembeddings here is much more complicated than in the toric case, see [18], [23].\nIt is also natural to replace the torus T with the commutative unipotent group Gna =\nGa \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Ga (n times), where Ga is the additive group of the ground field K. The theory of\ngenerically transitive Gna -actions may be regarded as an \"additive analogue\" of toric geometry.\nBut in this case we come across principal differences. It is easy to see that a generically\ntransitive action of a unipotent group on an affine variety is transitive [20, Section 1.3].\nSo, in contrast with the toric case, we can not cover a variety with generically transitive\nSupported by RFBR grants 09-01-99648-, 09-01-90416-Ukr-f-a, and the Deligne 2004 Balzan Prize in\nMathematics.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\nGna -action by invariant affine charts. Also it is known that any toric variety contains finitely\nmany T -orbits and that an isomorphism between toric varieties as algebraic varieties provides\ntheir isomorphism in the category of toric varieties [6, Theorem 4.1]. In additive case these\nproperties do not hold: one may consider two G2a -actions on the projective plane P2 given in\nhomogeneous coordinates as\n[z0 : z1 : z2 ] \u2192 [z0 : z1 + a1 z0 : z2 + a2 z0 ]\nand\n[z0 : z1 : z2 ] \u2192 [z0 : z1 + a1 z0 : z2 + a1 z1 + (\n\na21\n+ a2 )z0 ].\n2\n\nIn the first case, there is a line consisting of fixed points, while for the second action there\nare three G2a -orbits. Finishing with these negative observations, we turn to a positive side.\nIn [13], an algebraic interpretation of generically transitive Gna -actions on Pn is given.\nNamely, it is shown there that such actions correspond to local finite-dimensional algebras.\nThe aim of the present paper is to study this correspondence in more details. In Section 1\nwe recall basic facts on generically transitive Gna -actions. There is an initial correspondence\nbetween cyclic rational faithful (m + 1)-dimensional Gna -modules V and isomorphism classes\nof pairs (R, U), where R is a local associative commutative K-algebra with an m-dimensional\nmaximal ideal m and U is an n-dimensional subspace of m that generates the algebra R.\nThese data determine a generically transitive Gna -action on the closure of the orbit Gna hvi in\nthe projectivization Pm of the space V with v \u2208 V being a cyclic vector. Conversely, every\ngenerically transitive Gna -action on a normal projective variety arises in this way. Suppose\nthat the subspace U coincides with the maximal ideal m, or equivalently, n = m. Then we\nobtain a generically transitive Gna -action on the projective space Pn .\nLet G be an algebraic group acting on an algebraic variety X. Recall that modality of the\naction is the maximal number of parameters in a continuous family of G-orbits on X. In\nSection 2 modality of a generically transitive Gna -action on Pn is calculated in terms of the\ncorresponding local algebra R. Also some estimates on modality are given. The next section\nis devoted to classification of Gna -actions on Pn of modality one. The classification results in\nseries of finite-dimensional 2-generated local algebras (Theorem 3). It implies that for every\ngiven n the number of actions of modality one is finite and for n \u2265 5 there are exactly n + 1\ngenerically transitive Gna -actions on Pn of modality one. On the contrary, actions of modality\ntwo admit moduli spaces of positive dimension. It brings some analogy with the embedding\ntheory for homogeneous spaces of reductive groups with small complexity, cf. [23].\nStarting from Section 4 we study generically transitive Gna -actions on projective hypersurfaces. These actions correspond to the case when U is a hyperplane in the ideal m. Generically\ntransitive Gna -actions on the non-degenerate quadric Qn \u2282 Pn+1 are described in [21]. It is\nshown there that for every n such an action is unique up to isomorphism, and the corresponding pair (R, U) is indicated. We prove in Section 4 that families (of isomorphism classes) of\ngenerically transitive Gna -actions on a degenerate quadric admit moduli. In Theorem 4 we\ncharacterize pairs (R, U) representing actions on quadrics and develop an algebraic techniques\nto deal with such actions. More generally, Theorem 5 states that if U is a hyperplane in m and\nthe pair (R, U) determines a generically transitive Gna -action on a hypersurface X \u2282 Pn+1 ,\nthen the degree of X equals the maximal exponent d such that md is not contained in U.\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n3\n\nIn the last section we discuss possible generalizations, namely, Gna -structures on flag varieties and toric varieties.\nWe use [12] as a general reference for algebraic geometry, and [14] for algebraic groups\nand their representations. The ground field K is assumed to be algebraically closed and of\ncharacteristic zero.\n1. Hassett-Tschinkel correspondence\nIn this section we recall some results from [13], see also [21, \u00a7 2]. Let \u03c1 : Gna \u2192 GLm+1 (K) be\na faithful rational representation. The differential defines a representation d\u03c1 : g \u2192 glm+1 (K)\nof the tangent algebra g = Lie(Gna ) and the induced representation \u03c4 : U(g) \u2192 Matm+1 (K) of\nthe universal enveloping algebra U(g). Since the group Gna is commutative, the algebra U(g)\nis isomorphic to the polynomial algebra K[x1 , . . . , xn ], where g is identified with the subspace\nhx1 , . . . , xn i. The algebra R := \u03c4 (U(g)) is isomorphic to the factor algebra U(g)/Ker \u03c4 , where\nKer \u03c4 = {y \u2208 U(g) : \u03c4 (y) = 0}. As \u03c4 (x1 ), . . . , \u03c4 (xn ) are commuting nilpotent operators, the\nalgebra R is finite-dimensional and local. Let us denote by X1 , . . . , Xn the images of the\nelements x1 , . . . , xn in R. Then the maximal ideal of R is m := (X1 , . . . , Xn ). Clearly, the\nsubspace U := \u03c4 (g) = hX1 , . . . , Xn i generates the algebra R.\nAssume that Km+1 is a cyclic Gna -module with a cyclic vector v, i.e., h\u03c1(Gna )vi = Km+1 .\nThe subspace \u03c4 (U(g))v is g- and Gna -invariant; it contains the vector v and therefore coincides\nwith the space Km+1 . Let I = {y \u2208 U(g) : \u03c4 (y)v = 0}. Since the vector v is cyclic, the ideal\nI coincides with Ker \u03c4 , and we get identifications\nR\u223c\n= \u03c4 (U(g))v = Km+1 .\n= U(g)/I \u223c\nUnder these identifications the action of an element \u03c4 (y) on Km+1 corresponds to the operator\nof multiplication by \u03c4 (y) on the factor algebra R, and the vector v \u2208 Km+1 goes to the residue\nclass of unit. Since Gna = exp(g), the Gna -action on Km+1 corresponds to the multiplication\nby elements of exp(U) on R.\nConversely, let R be a local (m+1)-dimensional algebra with a maximal ideal m, and U \u2286 m\nbe a subspace that generates the algebra R. Fix a basis X1 , . . . , Xn in U. Then R admits\na presentation K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/I, where I is the kernel of the homomorphism K[x1 , . . . , xn ] \u2192\nR, xi 7\u2192 Xi . These data define a faithful representation \u03c1 of the group Gna := exp(U) on the\nspace R: the operator \u03c1((a1 , . . . , an )) acts as multiplication by the element exp(a1 X1 + * * * +\nan Xn ). Since U generates R, one checks that the representation is cyclic with unit in R as a\ncyclic vector.\nSummarizing, we get the following result.\nTheorem 1. [13, Theorem 2.14]. The correspondence described above establishes a bijection\nbetween\n(1) equivalence classes of faithful cyclic rational representations \u03c1 : Gna \u2192 GLm+1 (K);\n(2) isomorphism classes of pairs (R, U), where R is a local (m + 1)-dimensional algebra\nwith a maximal ideal m and U is an n-dimensional subspace of m that generates the\nalgebra R.\nRemark 1. Let \u03c1 : Gna \u2192 GLm+1 (K) be a faithful cyclic rational representation. The\nset of cyclic vectors in Km+1 is an open orbit of a commutative algebraic group C with\n\n\f4\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\n\u03c1(Gna ) \u2286 C \u2286 GLm+1 (K), and the complement of this set is a hyperplane. In our notation,\nthe group C is the extension of the commutative unipotent group exp(m) by scalar matrices.\nA faithful linear representation \u03c1 : Gna \u2192 GLm+1 (K) determines an effective action of the\ngroup Gna on the projectivization Pm of the space Km+1 . Conversely, let G be a connected\naffine algebraic group with the trivial Picard group, and X be a normal G-variety. By [16,\nSection 2.4], every line bundle on X admits a G-linearization. Moreover, if G has no nontrivial characters, then a G-linearization is unique. This shows that every effective Gna -action\non Pm comes from a (unique) faithful rational (m + 1)-dimensional Gna -module.\nAn effective Gna -action on Pm is generically transitive if and only if n = m. In this case\nthe corresponding Gna -module is cyclic. It terms of Theorem 1 the condition n = m means\nU = m, and we obtain the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. [13, Proposition 2.15] There is a one-to-one correspondence between:\n(1) equivalence classes of generically transitive Gna -actions on Pn ;\n(2) isomorphism classes of local (n + 1)-dimensional algebras.\nIn this correspondence we realize the space Pn as the projectivization P(R) of the algebra\nR, and the Gna -action is given as the action of a group of invertible elements of R by multiplication. The complement of the open Gna -orbit on P(R) is the hyperplane P(m). More\nprecisely, let us give an algebraic interpretation of the Gna -orbit structure on Pn . Recall that\ntwo elements a and b of an algebra R are associated if there exists an invertible element c \u2208 R\nsuch that a = bc.\nProposition 1. The correspondence of Theorem 2 determines a bijection between Gna -orbits\non Pn and association classes of nonzero elements in the algebra R.\nProof. The Gna -orbit of the point [x] \u2208 P(R), where x \u2208 R\\{0}, coincides with [K\u00d7 *exp(m)x] \u2282\nP(R). Further, the set R\u00d7 of invertible elements of the algebra R is K\u00d7 \u2295 m. Since exp(m) =\n1 + m, we get K\u00d7 * exp(m)x = R\u00d7 x.\n\u0003\nRemark 2. The correspondence of Theorem 2 together with classification results of [22]\nyields that the number of equivalence classes of generically transitive Gna -actions on Pn is\nfinite if and only if n \u2264 5 [13, Section 3], see also [19].\n2. Modality of actions on projective spaces\nSuppose that an affine algebraic group G acts regularly on an irreducible algebraic variety\nX. It is well known [20, Section 1.4] that there is a non-empty open subset W \u2286 X consisting\nof G-orbits of maximal dimension. Denote by d(G, X) the codimension of the orbit Gx in\nX, where x \u2208 W . It follows from Rosenlicht's Theorem [20, Section 2.3] that d(G, X) equals\nthe transcendency degree of the field K(X)G of rational invariants on the variety X. The\ncondition d(G, X) = 0 means that the G-action is generically transitive.\nThe modality mod(G, X) of a G-action on X is the maximal value of d(G, Y ) over all\nirreducible G-invariant subvarieties Y \u2286 X. In particular, we have mod(G, X) = 0 if and\nonly if X contains a finite number of G-orbits.\nConsider an action of the group Gna on the space Pm corresponding to the pair (R, U) as\nin Section 1. Since the representation d\u03c1 of the Lie algebra g = Lie(Gna ) on the space Km+1\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n5\n\nis given by multiplication by elements of U on R, we conclude that the isotropy subalgebra\ngx of an element x \u2208 R coincides with the subspace\nAnnU (x) = {y \u2208 U : xy = 0}.\nIn particular, we have gx = 0 for every x \u2208 R \\ m. Denote by Ck,U the Zariski closure of\nthe subset {x \u2208 m : dim AnnU (x) = k} \u2286 m. Then the typical Gna -orbit on each irreducible\ncomponent of Ck,U is of dimension n \u2212 k. This gives a first interpretation of modality.\nProposition 2. The following equality holds\nmod(Gna , Pm ) = max(dim Ck,U + k) \u2212 (n + 1).\nk\n\nIn the sequel we consider generically transitive Gna -actions on Pn , i.e., assume n = m and\nU = m. Let us introduce some notation: Ann(x) := Annm (x), Ck := Ck,m and mod(R) :=\nmod(Gna , Pn ). Clearly, 0 \u2264 mod(R) \u2264 n \u2212 1. For each n, Hassett and Tschinkel have proved\nthat the extreme value 0 is achieved for a unique algebra R, see also Corollary 2 below. In\nProposition 4 we prove that the extreme value n \u2212 1 is also achieved in a unique way.\nExample 1. Let R = K[x1 , . . . , xs ]/IN +1 , where the ideal IN +1 \u2282 K[x1 , . . . , xs ] is generated\nby all monomials of degree N + 1. The annihilator of a polynomial f (X1 , . . . , Xs ) \u2208 R\ncoincides with the linear span of all monomials of degree \u2265 N + 1 \u2212 k, where k is degree of\nthe lowest term of f . Therefore all non-empty subsets Ck are linear spans of monomials of\ndegree greater or equal to a given value, and\n[N\n] \u0012\n\u0013 X\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\n2\nX\ns+i\u22121\ns+i\u22121\nmod(R) =\n\u2212\n\u2212 1.\ns\u22121\ns\n\u2212\n1\nN+1\ni=1\ni=[\n\n2\n\n]\n\nIn particular, N = 1 and s = n implies mod(R) = n \u2212 1.\nThe operator of multiplication by x \u2208 mi maps mj in mi+j . Thus dim Ann(x) \u2265 dim mj \u2212\ndim mi+j , and we get\nLemma 1. mod(R) \u2265 maxi,j (dim mi + dim mj \u2212 dim mi+j ) \u2212 (n + 1).\nSet ri := dim mi \u2212 dim mi+1 . In particular, r0 = 1. Suppose mN 6= 0 and mN +1 = 0. Then\nn = r1 + r2 + * * * + rN . Using Lemma 1 with j = 1, we obtain\nProposition 3. mod(R) \u2265 maxi ri \u2212 1.\nExample 1 shows that the modality can significantly exceed the value maxi ri \u2212 1.\nCorollary 1. If mod(R) = l, then the algebra R can be generated by l + 1 elements and\ndim mN \u2264 l + 1.\nCorollary 2. [13, Proposition 3.7] For any n > 0 there exists a unique (n + 1)-dimensional\nlocal algebra of modality zero; it is isomorphic to K[x]/(xn+1 ).\nProof. By Corollary 1, an algebra of modality zero is generated by one element.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet us recall that the sequence (r0 , r1 , . . . , rN ) is called the Hilbert-Samuel sequence of the\nalgebra R. This sequence does not determine modality of the algebra. Indeed, consider the\nalgebras\nK[x, y]/(x4 , xy, y 3) and K[x, y]/(x4 , y 2, x2 y).\n\n\f6\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\nThey share the same Hilbert-Samuel sequence (1, 2, 2, 1). In the next section it is shown that\nthe first algebra has modality one, while the second one has modality two.\nLet Ann(m) = {x \u2208 m : yx = 0 for all y \u2208 m}. Then the subspace P(Ann(m)) coincides\nwith the set of Gna -fixed points in Pn , and the inequality mod(R) \u2265 rN \u22121 can be strengthened\nas mod(R) \u2265 dim Ann(m) \u2212 1. It is known that a local finite-dimensional algebra R is\nGorenstein if and only if dim Ann(m) = 1 [9, Proposition 21.5]. Such algebras are assigned\nto generically transitive Gna -actions on Pn with a unique fixed point.\nProposition 4. For each n > 0 there exists a unique (n + 1)-dimensional local algebra of\nmodality n \u2212 1; it is isomorphic to K[x1 , . . . , xn ]/(xi xj , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 j \u2264 n).\nProof. Suppose there is a Gna -action on Pn with an (n \u2212 1)-parameter continuous orbit family.\nThen any orbit from this family is just a Gna -fixed point. The complement to the open orbit\nin Pn is the hyperplane P(m), so all the points in this hyperplane should be Gna -fixed. This\ncondition is equivalent to the equality m2 = 0.\n\u0003\nRemark 3. Since the association classes in the algebra R coincide with orbits of the lineal\nalgebraic group K\u00d7 * exp(m), the classes of a given dimension form a finite union of irreducible\nlocally closed subvarieties in R. The codimension of a class in such a subvariety may be\naddressed as the number of parameters in a continuous family of classes. The codimension\nis preserved under the passage to projectivization P(R), and by Proposition 1, the maximal\nnumber of parameters is the modality of R. Moreover, the closure of the association class\nof an element x \u2208 R coincides with the principal ideal Rx. Thus we may speak about the\nnumber of parameters in a continuous family of principal ideals and interpret mod(R) as the\nmaximum of these numbers.\nProposition 5. If I is a proper ideal of the algebra R, then\nmod(R/I) \u2264 mod(R).\nProof. The canonical homomorphism R \u2192 R/I induces a homomorphism of groups\nGna := exp(m) \u2192 Gra := exp(m/I),\n\nwhere r = dim(R/I) \u2212 1,\n\nand a surjective morphism of varieties P(R) \\ P(I) \u2192 P(R/I). The latter morphism is\nequivariant with respect to the Gna - and Gra -actions on P(R) and P(R/I) respectively. Assume\nthat we have a continuous k-parameter family of Gra -orbits on P(R/I). Some irreducible\ncomponent of the inverse image of this family projects to the family dominantly. Then\ntypical Gna -orbits on this component form at least k-parameter family on P(R) \\ P(I). This\ncompletes the proof.\n\u0003\nWe finish this section by introducing a combinatorial way to estimate modality of a local\n(n + 1)-dimensional algebra K[x1 , . . . , xs ]/I, where I is a monomial ideal. Denote by N the\nset of non-constant monomials in x1 , . . . , xs that do not belong to I. To each subset L \u2286 N\nassign a subset S(L) = {a \u2208 N : ab \u2208 I for any b \u2208 L}. The subset S(L) consists of\nmonomials annihilating all the elements of the factor algebra with support at L. It implies\nthe inequality\nmod(R) \u2265 max(|L| + |S(L)|) \u2212 (n + 1),\nL\n\nwhich can be strict. For example, with the algebra K[x1 , x2 ]/(x21 , x22 ) we get 1 > 0.\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n7\n\n3. Algebras of modality one\nIn this section we classify local algebras corresponding to generically transitive Gna -actions\non Pn of modality one.\nTheorem 3. Local finite-dimensional algebras of modality one form the following list:\nAa,b = K[x, y]/(xa+1 , y b+1 , xy), a \u2265 b \u2265 1;\nCa = K[x, y]/(xa+1 , y 2 \u2212 x3 ), a \u2265 3;\n\nBa,b = K[x, y]/(xy, xa \u2212 y b), a \u2265 b \u2265 2;\n\nCa1 = K[x, y]/(xa+1 , y 2 \u2212 x3 , xa y), a \u2265 3;\n\nCa2 = K[x, y]/(xa+1 , y 2 \u2212 x3 , xa\u22121 y), a \u2265 3;\n\nCa3 = K[x, y]/(y 2 \u2212 x3 , xa\u22122 y), a \u2265 4;\n\nD = K[x, y]/(x3 , y 2); E = K[x, y]/(x3 , y 2, x2 y).\nThese algebras are pairwise non-isomorphic.\nProof. It follows from Corollary 2 that all algebras of Theorem 3 have positive modality. Let\nus show that their modality does not exceed one.\nEvery element of the algebra R = Aa,b has the form\n\u03b1k xk + \u03b1k+1 xk+1 + . . . + \u03b2s y s + \u03b2s+1 y s+1 + . . . =\ng\n= (\u03b1k xk + \u03b2s y s )(1 + \u03b1g\nk+1 x + . . . + \u03b2s+1 y + . . .),\nwhere the second factor is invertible. For every 1 \u2264 k \u2264 a and 1 \u2264 s \u2264 b define a morphism\n\u03c6k,s : P1 \u2192 P(R),\n\n\u03c6k,s ([\u03b1 : \u03b2]) = [\u03b1xk + \u03b2y s].\n\nSince every non-open Gna -orbit in P(R) intersects \u03c6k,s (P1 ) for some k and s, modality of the\nalgebra Aa,b does not exceed one. The algebra Ba,b is a homomorphic image of Aa,b , and\nProposition 5 implies that modality of Ba,b does not exceed one.\nFor other types of algebras the following lemma is useful.\nLemma 2. Suppose that a linear basis v1 , . . . , vn of the ideal m of a local algebra R satisfies\nthe following conditions:\n1. the element vs does not belong to the principal ideal (vs+1 ) for every s \u2265 1;\n2. for all vs and vs+p , p \u2265 2, there exists a vector ws,p \u2208 m such that vs+p = vs ws,p and\nvs+1 ws,p = 0 or vr , r \u2265 s + p + 1.\nThen the modality of the algebra R does not exceed one.\nProof. Consider an element\nb = \u03b10 vs +\n\nX\n\n\u03b1p vs+p ,\n\nwith \u03b10 6= 0.\n\np\u22651\n\nLet us show that there exists an element\nc = 1 + \u03b22 ws,2 + . . . + \u03b2n\u2212s ws,n\u2212s\nsuch that b = (\u03b10 vs + \u03b11 vs+1 )c. Indeed, write down the equality\n\u03b10 vs + \u03b11 vs+1 + . . . + \u03b1n\u2212s vn = (\u03b10 vs + \u03b11 vs+1 )(1 + \u03b22 ws,2 + . . . + \u03b2n\u2212s ws,n\u2212s ),\n\n\f8\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\nand consider the coefficients at vs+2 , . . . , vn on the right. They are equal to \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n\u2212s\nrespectively, so one may find the values of \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2n\u2212s successively. The element c is invertible, so again every non-open Gna -orbit in P(R) intersects one of the curves \u03c6s (P1 ) with\n1 \u2264 s \u2264 n \u2212 1, where\n\u03c6s : P1 \u2192 P(R),\n\n\u03c6s ([\u03b1 : \u03b2]) = [\u03b1vs + \u03b2vs+1].\n\nThe assertion follows.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet us indicate a basis satisfying the conditions of Lemma 2 for the algebra Ca :\nx, y, x2 , xy, x3 , x2 y, . . . , xa , xa\u22121 y, xa y,\nand for the algebra D:\nx, y, x2 , xy, x2 y.\nThe algebras of types Ca1 , Ca2 , Ca3 are factor algebras of Ca and E is a factor algebra of D, so\ntheir modality cannot exceed one.\nNow we prove that any algebra of modality one is included in the list of Theorem 3.\nLemma 3. Modality of the algebra H := K[x, y]/(x4 , y 2 , x2 y) is greater than one.\nProof. One checks that typical G5a -orbits on the projective 3-space P(hx2 , x3 , y, xyi) are onedimensional.\n\u0003\nLemma 4. Let R = K[x, y]/I, where the ideal I is generated by polynomials not containing\nany of the terms x, x2 , x3 , y, xy. Then modality of R is greater than one.\nProof. By assumptions, the algebra H is a factor algebra of R.\n\n\u0003\n\nLet R be a local finite-dimensional algebra of modality one. Using Corollary 1, one can\nassume that it has the form K[x, y]/I, where every term of a polynomial from I has degree\n\u2265 2. Consider the algebra R\u2032 = R/m3 . It is easy to see that there exists a linear change of\nvariables taking R\u2032 to one of the following non-isomorphic algebras:\nK[x, y]/(x2 , xy, y 2), K[x, y]/(x3 , xy, y 2), K[x, y]/(x2 , y 2),\nK[x, y]/(x3 , xy, y 3), K[x, y]/(x3 , x2 y, y 2).\nCase 1: R\u2032 = K[x, y]/(x2 , xy, y 2). In this case we have m2 = m3 , so R = R\u2032 = A1,1 .\nCase 2: R\u2032 = K[x, y]/(x3 , xy, y 2). In this case xy, y 2 \u2208 m3 and the factor space mi /mi+1 is\nspanned by the class of the element xi with i \u2265 3. The elements of the form xi are linearly\n2\na\nindependent in R, hence\nP the ielements 1, y, x, x , . . . , x , a \u2265 2, form\u2032 a basis of\nPthis algebra.\nAssume that xy = i\u22653 \u03b1i x . Replace the basis element y with y = y \u2212 i\u22653 \u03b1i xi\u22121 to\nP\nobtain xy \u2032 = 0 and (y \u2032 )2 = j\u22653 \u03b2j xj . Suppose that the last expression is not zero and \u03b2s is\nthe first nonzero coefficient. If s < a, then multiplying the equality by xa\u2212s , we get xa = 0, a\ncontradiction. It means that (y \u2032 )2 = 0 or (y \u2032)2 = xa , and the algebras Aa,1 (a \u2265 2) and Ba,2\n(a \u2265 3) appear. Algebras of the second type are Gorenstein unlike the others. Algebras of\nthe same type with different indices have different dimensions.\nCase 3: R\u2032 = K[x, y]/(x2 , y 2). In this case x2 , y 2 \u2208 m3 and every monomial of degree three\nis in m4 , hence m3 = m4 = 0, R = R\u2032 . It is easy to check that the algebra R\u2032 is isomorphic to\nB2,2 .\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n9\n\n3\nCase 4: R\u2032 = K[x, y]/(x3 , xy, y 3). In this case we have xy \u2208 mP\nand R is aPlinear span of\na\nb\nthe elements 1, x, . . . , x , y, . . . , y , a \u2265 b \u2265 2. Assume that xy = i\u22653 \u03b1i xi + j\u22653 \u03b2j y j . Let\nus show that there\nproviding the condition xy = 0. Indeed, take\nP exists ak change\u2032 of variables\nP\n\u2032\na basis x = x + k\u22652 \u03c6k y and y = y + s\u22652 \u03c8s xs and write down\nX\nX\nX\nX\nX\nx\u2032 y \u2032 =\n\u03b1i xi +\n\u03b2j y j +\n\u03c6k y k+1 +\n\u03c8s xs+1 +\n\u03c6k \u03c8s xs y k .\ni\u22653\n\nj\u22653\n\ns\u22652\n\nk\u22652\n\nk,s\u22652\n\nHere the monomial xs y k is decomposed as the sum of terms xi and y j of degree at least\nk + s + 2 each. Now one can consider the coefficients at x3 , y 3, x4 , y 4, . . . in the expression for\nx\u2032 y \u2032 and obtain \u03c82 , \u03c62 , \u03c83 , \u03c63 , . . . one by one. Therefore, we can further assume that xy = 0.\nSuppose there is an element \u03ber xr + * * * + \u03bea xa + \u03bcp y p + * * * + \u03bcb y b , \u03ber 6= 0, in the ideal\nI. If r < a, then we can multiply both parts by xa\u2212r and come to a contradiction with the\ncondition xa 6= 0. In the same way it can be shown that p = b. Thus the algebras Aa,b ,\na \u2265 b \u2265 2, and Ba,b , a \u2265 b \u2265 3, appear. The inequalities are caused by linear independency\nof the classes of the elements x2 and y 2 in m2 /m3 . The algebras from the second family\nare Gorenstein unlike the others. The algebras of the same type with different indices have\ndifferent Hilbert-Samuel functions.\nP\nP\nCase 5: R\u2032 = K[x, y]/(x3 , x2 y, y 2). In this case we have y 2 = i\u22653 \u03b1i xi + j\u22652 \u03b2j xj y. A\nP\nchange y \u2032 = y + p\u22652 \u03c6p xp leads to the equation\nX\nX\nX\nX\n(y \u2032)2 =\n\u03b1i xi +\n\u03b2j xj y + 2\n\u03c6p xp y +\n\u03c6p \u03c6s xp+s .\ni\u22653\n\nj\u22652\n\np\u22652\n\np,s\u22652\n\nSetting the coefficients at x2 y, x3y, . . . P\nequal zero permits to obtain \u03c62 , \u03c63 , . . . one by one.\n2\nTherefore one can assume that y = i\u22653 \u03b1i xi . It is easy to see that there exists a root\nof any integer order from an element \u03b10 + \u03b11 x + \u03b12 x2 + . . ., where \u03b10 6= 0, in R. If y 2 =\nxe (\u03b1e + \u03b1e+1 x + . . .) and \u03b1e 6= 0, then replace y by v \u22121 y, where v 2 = \u03b1e + \u03b1e+1 x + . . ., to\nobtain y 2 = xe . Now there are the variants y 2 = 0 or y 2 = xe . If the elements xa and xc y are\nnonzero and xa+1 = xc+1 y = 0, then a \u2265 c \u2265 1 a \u2265 2 (since the elements x2 and xy are not\nin m3 ). Also the second possibility requires the restrictions a \u2265 e \u2265 3 and c + e \u2265 a, since\ny 2 xc+1 = xc+e+1 = 0.\nCase 5.1: y 2 = 0. There are also the conditions xa+1 = 0 and xc+1 y = 0. If there is no\nother relation in R,\n4 we obtain the algebras D and E. Suppose that we have\nP then by Lemma\nP\nanother equality i\u2265i0 \u03bei xi + j\u2265j0 \u03bcj xj y = 0. Then i0 \u2265 3 and j0 \u2265 2, since the elements x\nand y are linearly independent mod m2 , and the elements x2 and xy are linearly independent\nmod m3 . If all \u03bei = 0 (resp. \u03bcj = 0), then we obtain a contradiction multiplying by xc\u2212j0\n(resp. by xa\u2212i0 ). If i0 \u2264 c, then we get a contradiction multiplying by y. Hence i0 \u2265 c + 1.\nMoreover, if a \u2212 i0 6= c \u2212 j0 , then multiplying by an appropriate power of x again leads to a\ncontradiction. It means that i0 = a \u2212 d and j0 = c \u2212 d for some d \u2265 0; here a \u2212 d > c. Assume\nthat d is maximal over all relations. So there is a relation xa\u2212d \u03c71 \u2212 xc\u2212d \u03c72 y = 0, where\n\u03c7i = \u03b1i0 + \u03b1i1 x + . . ., \u03b1i0 6= 0, or equivalently, xa\u2212d \u2212 xc\u2212d \u03c7y = 0, where \u03c7 := \u03c7\u22121\n1 \u03c72 . The\na\u2212d\nc\u2212d\nreplacement of y by \u03c7y provides the relation x \u2212 x y = 0. One can subtract the relation\nof this form from any other relation with corresponding lower terms to cancel the lower terms\nor to obtain a contradiction. From Lemma 4 and the inequality a \u2212 d > c > d + 1 \u2265 1 it\nfollows that a \u2212 d = 3 and c = 2. In this case d = 0, a = 3, c = 2, and our algebra can be\n\n\f10\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\nwritten as K[x, y]/(y 2, x3 y, x3 \u2212 x2 y). Replace the variable x by \u22123x + y to show that this\nalgebra is isomorphic to D.\nCase 5.2: here R is a factor algebra of the algebra K[x, y]/(xa+1 , y 2 \u2212 xe , xc+1 y). If R\ncoincides with this algebra, then Lemma 4 reduces the proof to the case e = 3. The inequalities\na \u2265 c \u2265 a \u2212 e imply four possible variants: c = a, a \u2212 1, a \u2212 2, a \u2212 3 . In the last case it\nfollows from c \u2265 1 that a \u2265 4 and wePget the algebras\nCa , Ca1 , Ca2 and Ca3 respectively.\nP\nAssume there is another relation i\u2265i0 \u03bei xi + j\u2265j0 \u03bcj xj y = 0. As in the previous case\none shows that i0 \u2265 3, j0 \u2265 2 and a \u2212 i0 = c \u2212 j0 = d. Again set the value of d maximal\nover all relations; thus the equation of described form implies all the relations in the algebra\nR. Multiply the equation by y to obtain another equation with lower terms xc\u2212d+e and\nxa\u2212d y. It is compatible with the others whenever there are extra restrictions: two inequalities\nc \u2212 d + e > a and a \u2212 d > c or one equality a \u2212 (c \u2212 d + e) = c \u2212 (a \u2212 d). The last formula\nis equivalent to e = 2(a \u2212 c). Here e \u2265 4, hence a \u2212 c \u2265 2. It means that a \u2212 d \u2265 c \u2212 d + 2;\ntherefore we have a \u2212 d \u2265 4, c \u2212 d \u2265 2. From Lemma 4 it follows that there are no algebras\nof modality one in this case.\nThus the restrictions c \u2212 d + e > a and a \u2212 d > c hold. Lemma 4 reduces the remainder to\nthe following cases:\nCase 5.2.1: e = 3. From the inequalities c + 3 \u2212 d > a and a \u2212 d > c it follows that\n3 \u2212 2d > 0, hence d = 0, 1. If d = 1, then c + 2 > a > c + 1, and we come to a contradiction.\nIf d = 0, then c + 3 > a > c; in other words, we have c = a \u2212 1 or c = a \u2212 2. If the second\npossibility holds, then a = c + 2 \u2265 2 + d + 2 = 4. Denote the obtained algebras by Da1 and\nDa2 respectively. We are going to prove that they are isomorphic to Ca\u22121 and Ca3 .\nCase 5.2.1.1: Da1 \u223c\n= Ca\u22121 (a \u2265 4) and D31 \u223c\n= D. Consider the following variable change\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\nin Ca\u22121 : x = ux + vy, y = wx + zy, where u, v, w, z are some invertible polynomials\nin x. The first required equality (x\u2032 )a y \u2032 = 0 holds automatically. The second condition\n(x\u2032 )a = (x\u2032 )a\u22121 y 6= 0 gives an equality for the constant terms: av0 = z0 . The third relation\n(x\u2032 )3 = (y \u2032)2 provides the equation\nx3 (u3 \u2212 z 2 ) + x4 (3uv 2 \u2212 w 2 ) + x2 y(3u2v \u2212 2wz) + x3 yv 3 = 0.\nSince the u, v, w, z do not contain y, one obtains all the coefficients of u, v, w, z considering\nthe coefficients at x3 , x2 y, x4 , x3 y, . . . . Thus we determine the required generators and prove\nthe isomorphism.\nCase 5.2.1.2: Da2 \u223c\n= Ca3 . The proof is similar. Consider x\u2032 = ux + vy and y \u2032 = wx2 + zy in\nCa3 , where u, v, w, z are some invertible polynomials in x. The condition (x\u2032 )a\u22121 y \u2032 = 0 holds\nautomatically; the relation (x\u2032 )a = (x\u2032 )a\u22122 y 6= 0 results in the equality for the constant terms\nu30 = u0 w0 + (a \u2212 2)v0 z0 ; the last equality (x\u2032 )3 = (y \u2032)2 provides the relation\nx3 (u3 \u2212 z 2 ) + x4 (3uv 2 \u2212 w 2 ) + x2 y(3u2v \u2212 2wz) + x3 yv 3 = 0,\nwhich determines u, v, w, z like in the previous case.\nCase 5.2.2: a \u2212 d = 3. Here we obtain a = 3, hence e = 3, and this case reduces to 5.2.1.\nNow we have to prove that the algebras Ca , Ca1 , Ca2 , Ca3 , D and E are not pairwise isomorphic. The algebras Ca , Ca3 and D are Gorenstein. To prove that they are not isomorphic let\nus calculate their dimensions:\ndim Ca = 2(a + 1) \u2265 8,\n\ndim Ca3 = 2a \u2212 1 \u2265 7,\n\ndim D = 6.\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n11\n\nFor non-Gorenstein algebras dimensions are\ndim Ca1 = 2a + 1 \u2265 7,\n\ndim Ca2 = 2a \u2265 6,\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 3.\n\ndim E = 5.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3. For n \u2265 5 there are (n + 1) pairwise non-isomorphic local (n + 1)-dimensional\nalgebras of modality one, while for n = 2 we have 1 algebra, for n = 3 there are 2 algebras,\nand for n = 4 there are 4 algebras. In particular, for any n > 0 the number of equivalence\nclasses of generically transitive Gna -actions of modality one on Pn is finite.\nLet us show that there is an infinite family of pairwise non-isomorphic 7-dimensional local\nalgebras of modality two. Consider algebras with Hilbert-Samuel sequence (1, 3, 3). Here\nmultiplication is determined by a bilinear symmetric map m/m2 \u00d7 m/m2 \u2192 m2 . Such maps\nform a 18-dimensional space; the group GL(3) \u00d7 GL(3) acts here with a one-dimensional\ninefficiency kernel. It means that there are infinitely many generic pairwise non-isomorphic\nalgebras of this type. Let us prove that modality of a generic algebra equals two. By\nProposition 2, mod(R) = maxk (dim Ck + k) \u2212 (n + 1); here the annihilator of a generic point\nx \u2208 m coincides with m2 , so k = 3 and C3 = m. When k = 4 (resp. 5), the dimension of Ck\ndecreases by 1 (resp. at least by 2). Finally, for k = 6 the space Ck coincides with m2 . One\nconcludes that mod(R) = (6 + 3) \u2212 7 = 2.\nNote that for every monomial ideal I the finite-dimensional algebra K[x, y]/I determines\nthe Young diagram with boxes assigned to all monomials not in I. Conversely, to every Young\ndiagram one assigns a local finite-dimensional monomial algebra with two generators. The\ndiagrams (n) and (1, . . . , 1) correspond to modality zero.\n\nqqq\n\nqq\nq\n\nBy Theorem 3, diagrams of modality one are exactly (s, 1, . . . , 1), (2, 2), (3, 2), (2, 2, 1),\n(3, 3) and (2, 2, 2).\nqqq\nq\nqq\n\nIt would be interesting to calculate the modality for an arbitrary Young diagram. Another\nintriguing problem is to connect Theorem 3 with the classification of singularities of modality\none in the sense of [3].\nLet us also mention that finite-dimensional 2-generated local algebras occur in the study\nof local punctual Hilbert schemes and of pairs of commuting nilpotent matrices. Lately\nthere were many works in this direction, see [5] and references therein. Let (A, B) be a pair\nof commuting nilpotent n \u00d7 n matrices with a fixed cyclic vector. If R = K[A, B], then\nmod(R) may be interpreted as the maximal number of parameters in a continuous family of\nsubspaces invariant for both A and B. The variety of pairs of commuting nilpotent matrices\n\n\f12\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\nwith a fixed cyclic vector admits a natural action of the general linear group. It is shown in\n[17, Theorem 1.9] that if we consider the canonical map from the punctual Hilbert scheme\nHilbn (A2 ) to the symmetric power Symn (A2 ), the quotient by the action mentioned above\nis the fibre H[n] over the point np, where p is a point on A2 . Roughly speaking, the local\npunctual Hilbert scheme H[n] parametrizes 2-generated local algebras of dimension n. The\nHilbert-Samuel sequence defines a stratification of H[n] by locally closed subsets, see [15,\nProposition 1.6]. Applications of this stratification in linear algebra may be found in [5]. The\nmodality being another numerical invariant of a local algebra gives rise to other stratification\nof H[n], and it may be interesting to study its properties.\n4. Gna -actions on degenerate quadrics\nWe return to the settings of Section 1. Given the projectivization Pm of a rational Gna module and a point x \u2208 Pm , the closure of the orbit Gna * x is a projective variety. Since\nthe closure is Gna -invariant, it inherits a (generically transitive) Gna -action. Conversely, any\nnormal projective Gna -variety can be equivariantly embedded into the projectivization of a\nrational Gna -module [20, Section 1.2]. If the action is generically transitive, then one may\nassume that this is the orbit closure of a cyclic vector. Therefore any generically transitive\nGna -action on a normal projective variety is determined by a pair (R, U), see Theorem 1. This\ntime the correspondence is not bijective, since the orbit closure is not necessarily normal and\nthe equivariant embedding of a projective variety into the projectivization of a Gna -module is\nnot unique. For example, the pair (K[x]/(xm+1 ), hxi) determines a standard Ga -action on P1\nfor all m \u2265 1.\nLet R be a local (m + 1)-dimensional algebra with a maximal ideal m and U be an ndimensional subspace of m that generates the algebra R. A pair (R, U) is called an H-pair\nif U is a hyperplane in m, or, equivalently, m = n + 1. Such pairs correspond to generically\ntransitive Gna -actions on hypersurfaces in Pn+1 . The degree of the hypersurface is called the\ndegree of the H-pair.\nAn H-pair of degree 2 is called quadratic. In this case we get a generically transitive\nGna -action of a projective quadric\nQ(n, k) := {[z0 : z1 : . . . : zn+1 ] ; q(z0 , z1 , . . . , zn+1 ) = 0} \u2282 Pn+1 ,\nwhere q is a quadratic form of rank k + 2 with 1 \u2264 k \u2264 n. In this notation the non-degenerate\nquadric Qn \u2282 Pn+1 is Q(n, n); see [12, Chapter I, Exercise 5.12] for basic geometric properties\nof projective quadrics.\nExample 2. Consider the H-pair (R, U) = (K[x]/(x5 ), hx, x2 , x4 i). Denote by X1 , X2 and\nX3 the images of the elements x, x2 and x4 in the algebra R. We have\nexp(a1 X1 + a2 X2 + a3 X3 ) =\na2\na3\na2 a2\na4\na21\nX2 + 2 X3 + a1 a2 X13 + 1 X13 + 1 X3 + 1 X3 ,\n2\n2\n6\n2\n24\n3\nand the Ga -orbit of the line h1i has the form\n\u0015\n\u001b\n\u001a\u0014\na31\na22 a21 a2 a41\na21\n; a1 , a2 , a3 \u2208 K .\n: a1 a2 +\n: a3 +\n+\n+\n1 : a1 : a2 +\n2\n6\n2\n2\n24\n= 1 + a1 X1 + a2 X2 + a3 X3 +\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n13\n\nIn homogeneous coordinates [z0 : z1 : z2 : z3 : z4 ] on P4 our pair determines a hypersurface\ngiven by the equation:\n3z02 z3 \u2212 3z0 z1 z2 + z13 = 0.\nIt is proved in [21] that the quadric Qn admits a unique (up to isomorphism) generically\ntransitive Gna -action corresponding to the pair (An , Un ), where\nAn = K[y1 , . . . , yn ]/(yi yj , yi2 \u2212 yj2 ; i 6= j) and Un = hY1 , . . . , Yn i\nfor n > 1, and A1 = K[y1 ]/(y13), U1 = hY1 i. Here by Yi we denote the image of the element\nyi in An . We describe below the H-pairs that determine generically transitive Gna -actions on\ndegenerate quadrics. An algebra homomorphism \u03c6 : R \u2192 R\u2032 is called a homomorphism of\nH-pairs \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (R\u2032 , U \u2032 ) if \u03c6(U) = U \u2032 . Since the subspace U \u2032 generates the algebra R\u2032 ,\na homomorphism of H-pairs is a surjective homomorphism of algebras.\nProposition 6. An H-pair (R, U) determines a generically transitive Gna -action on the\nquadric Q(n, k) if and only if there exists a homomorphism of H-pairs \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (Ak , Uk ).\nProof. Suppose that a pair (R, U) determines a generically transitive Gna -action on Q(n, k).\nLet q be the corresponding quadratic Gna -invariant form and B the associated bilinear symmetric form. The operator of multiplication by an element a \u2208 U is skew-symmetric with\nrespect to the form B, i.e., B(ab, c) + B(b, ac) = 0 for every b, c \u2208 R. If an element c is in the\nkernel I of the form B, then the first term is zero, and ac \u2208 I. The subspace U generates the\nalgebra R, so I is an ideal in R.\nLet us show that I \u2286 U. Otherwise one has m = U + I. Putting b = c = 1 in the condition\nof skew-symmetry, we get B(1, U) = 0 and hence B(1, m) = 0. For every u1 , u2 \u2208 U one has\nB(u1 , u2) + B(1, u1 u2 ) = 0. It means that B restricted to U is zero. Note that B(1, 1) = 0,\nsince the unit corresponds to a point on the quadric. But the form B should be of rank at\nleast 3, a contradiction.\nThe form q induces a non-degenerate quadratic form q on the factor algebra R/I. The condition of skew-symmetry shows that q is Gka -invariant, where the Gka -action is given by the pair\n(R/I, U/I). By [21, Theorem 3] this pair is isomorphic to (Ak , Uk ), and the homomorphism\nwe need is the projection (R, U) \u2192 (R/I, U/I).\nConversely, assume that \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (Ak , Uk ) is a homomorphism of H-pairs. One can\nlift the non-degenerate Gka -invariant form q on Ak to a Gna -invariant form q on R by putting\nthe kernel I of the form q equals Ker (\u03c6). We know that the H-pair (R, U) determines a\ngenerically transitive Gna -action on some hypersurface and that q(1) = 0; so this hypersurface\nis the quadric q = 0.\n\u0003\nCorollary 4. If \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (R\u2032 , U \u2032 ) is a homomorphism of H-pairs and the H-pair (R\u2032 , U \u2032 )\nis quadratic, then the H-pair (R, U) is quadratic as well.\nTheorem 4. An H-pair (R, U) is quadratic if and only if m3 \u2282 U.\nProof. If m3 \u2282 U, then (R/m3 , U/m3 ) is an H-pair. If we prove that any pair (R, U) with\nm3 = 0 is quadratic, then Theorem 4 follows from Corollary 4. The algebra R can be\ndecomposed into the direct sum of its subspaces: R = h1i \u2295 U \u2295 h\u03bci, where \u03bc \u2208 m2 . Define a\nbilinear symmetric form B on the space R by B(1, 1) = 0, B(1, \u03bc) = \u22121, B(1, U) = 0, and for\nevery x, y \u2208 m obtain the value B(x, y) from the equality xy = u + B(x, y)\u03bc, where u \u2208 U. In\n\n\f14\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\nthis case the rank of the form B is at least 3. Let us check that the operator of multiplication\nby an element u \u2208 U is skew-symmetric with respect to B. Fix a basis e0 = 1, e1 , . . . , en \u2208 U\nand en+1 = \u03bc in the algebra R. It suffices to show that B(uei , ej ) + B(ei , uej ) = 0 for all\ni \u2264 j. Here both terms are zeroes apart from the case i = 0, j = 1, . . . , n, and B(ue0 , ej ) is\nthe coefficient at \u03bc in the decomposition of the element uej , while B(e0 , uej ) is opposite to\nthe coefficient at \u03bc for the same element.\nConversely, suppose that an H-pair (R, U) is quadratic. Then for some k there exists a\nhomomorphism of H-pairs \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (Ak , Uk ). If m3 is not contained in U, then its image\n\u03c6(m3 ) is not contained in Uk , hence \u03c6(m3 ) 6= 0. But in Ak the cube of the maximal ideal is\nzero, a contradiction.\n\u0003\nCorollary 5. Consider a homomorphism \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (R\u2032 , U \u2032 ) of H-pairs. The H-pair\n(R, U) is quadratic if and only if the H-pair (R\u2032 , U \u2032 ) is quadratic.\nLet us take a closer look at pairs (R, U) determining generically transitive Gna -actions on\nthe quadric Q(n, n \u2212 1). There is a homomorphism \u03c6 : (R, U) \u2192 (An\u22121 , Un\u22121 ) described in\nProposition 6. Its kernel I should be one-dimensional, we have mI = 0 and Ann(m) = hI, Ci,\nwhere C \u2208 m is an element with \u03c6(C) = Y12 . The multiplication determines a bilinear map\n(U/I) \u00d7 (U/I) \u2192 Ann(m). Let us fix a basis vector P in I and obtain two bilinear symmetric\nforms B1 and B2 on U/I:\nxy = B1 (x + I, y + I)P + B2 (x + I, y + I)C for all x, y \u2208 U.\nThe form B2 is non-degenerate. Not the vectors P and C, but the line hB2 i and the linear\nspan hB1 , B2 i are defined uniquely. If B1 and B2 are proportional, one can obtain B1 = 0 by\nchanging the basis; in this case we get the pair\nR = K[x1 , . . . , xn\u22121 , p ]/(xi xj , x2i \u2212 x2j , xi p, p2 ; i 6= j), U = hX1 , . . . , Xn\u22121 , P i.\nOtherwise the flag hB2 i \u2282 hB1 , B2 i in the space of bilinear forms on U/I is well-defined. In\nan appropriate basis the form B2 is represented by the identity matrix, and the matrix of the\nform B1 is diagonal. One can assume that the second matrix has 1 and 0 as first two diagonal\nelements and other n \u2212 3 diagonal elements determine the parameters for isomorphism classes\nof the pairs. Hence there is an infinite family of pairwise non-equivalent generically transitive\nG4a -actions on the quadric Q(4, 3). Set the quadric Q(4, 3) by the equation z12 +z22 +z32 = 2z0 z5\nin P5 ; the action of the element (a1 , a2 , a3 , a4 ) at the point [z0 : z2 : z2 : z3 : z4 : z5 ] is given\nby the formula\na2 + a23 t + 2a4\n[z0 : a1 z0 + z1 : a2 z0 + z2 : a3 z0 + z3 : 2\nz0 + a2 z2 + ta3 z3 + z4 :\n2\na2 + a22 + a23\nz0 + a1 z1 + a2 z2 + a3 z3 + z5 ]\n: 1\n2\ndepending on the parameter t \u2208 K.

Degree of a hypersurface\nThe following result generalizes Theorem 4.\nTheorem 5. Let X be the closure of a generic orbit of an effective Gna -action on Pn+1\ncorresponding to an H-pair (R, U). Then the degree of the hypersurface X equals the maximal\nexponent d such that the subspace U does not contain the ideal md .\nProof. Let N be the maximal exponent with mN 6= 0 and d be the maximal exponent with\nmd 6\u2282 U. Consider the flag UN \u2286 UN \u22121 \u2286 * * * \u2286 U1 = U, where Ui = mi \u2229 U, and construct a\nbasis {ei } in U coordinated with this flag. Add a vector e \u2208 md \\ U to obtain a basis in m.\nFor a nonzero vector v \u2208 m the maximal number l such that v \u2208 ml is called the weight of\nthe vector and is denoted by \u03c9(v). For example, \u03c9(e) = d. One may assume that the weights\nof the vectors e1 , . . . , en do not decrease, that the vectors e1 , . . . , es are the basis vectors of\nweight 1, and that the vectors e1 , . . . , ek are the basis vectors of weight < d. The hypersurface\nX coincides with the closure of the projectivization of the set\n{exp(a1 e1 + * * * + an en ) : a1 , . . . , an \u2208 K}.\nSuppose that exp(a1 e1 + * * *+ an en ) = 1 + z1 e1 + * * * + zn en + ze. Then zi = ai + fi (a1 , . . . , ari ),\nwhere the weights of e1 , . . . , eri do not exceed \u03c9(ei ). In particular, z1 = a1 , . . . , zs = as .\njr\nAssume that i > s. For any term \u03b1aj11 . . . ari i , \u03b1 \u2208 K\u00d7 , of the polynomial fi one has\nj1 \u03c9(e1 ) + * * * + jri \u03c9(eri ) \u2264 \u03c9(ei ).\nObserve that ai = zi \u2212 fi (a1 , . . . , ari ). One can show by induction that any element ap ,\np = 1, . . . , ri , can be expressed as a polynomial Fp of degree \u2264 \u03c9(ep ) in z1 , . . . , zrp , zp . It means\nthat ai can be expressed as a polynomial Fi of degree \u2264 \u03c9(ei ) in z1 , . . . , zri , zi . Finally, we have\nz = f (a1 , . . . , ak ), where for every term \u03b1aj11 . . . ajkk , \u03b1 \u2208 K\u00d7 , one has j1 \u03c9(e1 ) + * * * + jk \u03c9(ek ) \u2264\nd. Replace each ai , i = 1, . . . , k by its expression in z1 , . . . , zri , zi and obtain z = F (z1 , . . . , zk ).\nTherefore the degree of every term of the polynomial F does not exceed d.\nFor any polynomial G(y1 , . . . , ym ) of degree r one can multiply each term of degree q by\nr\u2212q\nz0 to get a homogeneous polynomial that we denote by HG(z0 , y1 , . . . , ym ). The polynomial\nFe(z1 , . . . , zk , z) = z \u2212 F (z1 , . . . , zk ) being linear in z is irreducible. Thus the closure of the\norbit Gna h1i is given by the equation H Fe(z0 , z1 , . . . , zk , z) = 0, where z0 denotes the first\ncoordinate in the basis {1, e1 , . . . , en , e} of the algebra R.\nWe have to show that there is a term of degree d in the polynomial F . We use induction\non n. If n = 1, then the corresponding pair is (R, U) = (K[y]/(y 3), hyi). Here d = 2, and the\npair is quadratic by Theorem 4. Suppose n \u2265 2. Then the linear span I = hek+1 , . . . , en i is a\nsubset of U and an ideal in R. As we know, the polynomials F (z1 , . . . , zk ) for two pairs (R, U)\nand (R/I, U/I) coincide. So the assumption is applicable if I 6= 0. There is only one case left,\nnamely, I = 0, or, equivalently, k = n, md = hei and md+1 = 0. In this situation the element\ne can be represented as a homogeneous form of degree d in e1 , . . . , es . It is well known that\nevery homogeneous form of degree d can be decomposed as the sum of d-th powers of linear\nforms. Hence e is equal to a d-th power of some linear combination of e1 , . . . , es . Changing\nthe basis, one can assume that ed1 = e and that th e vectors e1 , e21 , . . . , ed\u22121\nform the subset\n1\n{ei : i \u2208 I} of the basis {e1 , . . . , en } of the space U. Then for any j \u2208\n/ I the polynomial fj has\n\u03c9(e )\nno terms depending only on a1 . Further, if i \u2208 I, then fi contains the term \u03c9(e1i )! a1 i . One\ncan show by induction that the polynomial Fi contains some term depending on zi whenever\n\n\f16\n\nIVAN ARZHANTSEV AND ELENA SHAROYKO\n\ni \u2208 I. So we can presume that the pair (R, U) is of the form (K[y]/(y d+1), hy, y 2, . . . , y d\u22121i)\nfor calculating the coefficient at z1d in the polynomial F (z1 , . . . , zk ). For this pair we have\ne1 = y, e2 = y 2 , . . . , ed\u22121 = y d\u22121 and e = y d.

Concluding remarks\nWe would like to mention several classes of algebraic varieties where the classification of\ngenerically transitive Gna -actions may be valuable.\nLet G be a connected semisimple algebraic group and P be a parabolic subgroup of G. The\nhomogeneous space G/P is a projective variety called a (generalized) flag variety. All flag\nvarieties admitting a generically transitive Gna -action are found in [4]. Recently E. Feigin [10]\nhas constructed a Gna -degeneration for arbitrary flag varieties. On the other side, the problem\nof description of all generically transitive Gna -actions on a given flag variety is still open.\nHassett-Tschinkel correspondence provides such a description for Pn \u223c\n= SL(n + 1)/P1 , where\nP1 is a maximal parabolic subgroup in SL(n+1) corresponding to the first simple root. By [21],\na generically transitive Gna -action on the non-degenerate quadric Qn \u223c\n= SO(n+2)/P1 is unique.\nWe expect further uniqueness results for the Grassmannians Gr(k, n) with 2 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2212 2.\n\n\fHASSETT-TSCHINKEL CORRESPONDENCE\n\n17\n\nThe study of generically transitive Gna -actions on G-varieties is related to classification of\nmaximal commutative unipotent subgroups in G. More precisely, let G be an affine algebraic\ngroup acting on a variety X and F be a commutative unipotent subgroup of G. Assume that\nthe restricted F -action on X is generically transitive. Then F is a maximal commutative\nunipotent subgroup of G. For G = SL(n+1), a characterization of maximal commutative\nunipotent subgroups which act generically transitively on Pn may be obtained from [22,\nTheorem 15].\nThe classification of singular del Pezzo surfaces with a generically transitive G2a -action is\nobtained by U. Derenthal and D. Loughran [8].\nFinally let us return to toric varieties. Applying the blow-up construction, one obtains\nmany generically transitive Gna -actions on toric varieties starting from Pn . But how to get\na complete classification of Gna -actions? The first instructive examples are the Hirzebruch\nsurfaces Fn . It is proved in [13, Proposition 5.5] that for n > 0 the surface Fn carries two\ndistinct generically transitive G2a -actions.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors are grateful to the referee for a careful reading and many helpful suggestions\nand remarks.\nReferences\n[1] K.
