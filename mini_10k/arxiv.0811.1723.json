Phys. A: Math. Gen.\n\n\fFinite-temperature Screening and the Specific Heat of Doped Graphene Sheets\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nGraphene is a newly realized two-dimensional (2D) electron system that has attracted\na great deal of interest in the scientific community because of the new physics which it\nexhibits and because of its potential as a new material for electronic technology [1, 2].\nThe agent responsible for many of the interesting electronic properties of graphene\nsheets is the non-Bravais honeycomb-lattice arrangement of Carbon atoms, which leads\nto a gapless semiconductor with valence and conduction \u03c0-bands. States near the\nFermi energy of a graphene sheet are described by a spin-independent massless Dirac\nHamiltonian [3]\nHD = vF \u03c3 * p ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere vF is the Fermi velocity, which is density-independent and roughly three-hundred\ntimes smaller that the velocity of light in vacuum, and \u03c3 = (\u03c3 x , \u03c3 y ) is a vector\nconstructed with two Pauli matrices {\u03c3 i , i = x, y}, which operate on pseudospin\n(sublattice) degrees of freedom. Note that the eigenstates of HD have a definite chirality\nrather than a definite pseudospin, i.e. they have a definite projection of the honeycombsublattice pseudospin onto the momentum p.\nWhen non-relativistic Coulombic electron-electron interactions are added to the\nkinetic Hamiltonian (1), graphene represents a new type of many-electron problem,\ndistinct from both an ordinary 2D electron gas (EG) and from quantum electrodynamics.\nThe Dirac-like wave equation and the chirality of its eigenstates lead indeed to both\nunusual electron-electron interaction effects [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] and to unusual response to\nexternal potentials [9, 10].\nWithin this low energy description, the properties of doped graphene sheets depend\non the dimensionless coupling constant\ne2\n,\n(2)\n\u01eb~vF\nand on an ultraviolet cut-off \u039b = kc /kF. Here g = gs gv = 4 accounts for spin and valley\ndegeneracy, kF = (4\u03c0n/g)1/2 is the Fermi wave number with n the electron density, and\nkc should be assigned a value corresponding to the wavevector range over which the\ncontinuum model (1) describes graphene. For definiteness we take kc to be such that\n\u221a\n\u03c0kc2 = (2\u03c0)2 /A0 , where A0 = 3 3a20 /2 is the area of the unit cell in the honeycomb\nlattice, with a0 \u2243 1.42 \u00c5 the Carbon-Carbon distance. With this choice\n\u221a\ng\n\u039b= \u221a\n.\n(3)\nnA0\nThe continuum model is useful when kc \u226b kF , i.e. when \u039b \u226b 1.\nVafek [11] has recently shown that the specific heat of undoped graphene sheets\npresents an anomalous low-temperature behavior showing a logarithmic suppression\nwith respect to its noninteracting counterpart, CV (T \u2192 0)/CV (0) \u221d T / ln(T ). On\nthe other hand, in Refs. [6, 7] we have demonstrated (see also Ref. [8]) that doped\ngraphene sheets are normal (pseudochiral) Fermi liquids, with Landau parameters that\n\u03b1gr = g\n\n\f3\n\nFinite-temperature Screening and the Specific Heat of Doped Graphene Sheets\n\npossess, however, a quite distinct behavior from those of conventional 2D EGs. In this\nwork we calculate the Helmholtz free energy F (T ) of doped graphene sheets within\nthe Random Phase Approximation (RPA) [12, 13]. This allows us to access important\nthermodynamic quantities, such as the compressibility and the specific heat, which can\nbe calculated by taking appropriate derivatives of the free energy. We show that, at low\ntemperatures, the specific heat of doped graphene, contrary to the one of the undoped\nsystem [11], has the usual linear-in-temperature behavior, which is solely controlled by\nthe renormalized velocity of quasiparticles as in a normal Fermi liquid.\n2. The Helmoltz free energy and the Lindhard response function at finite\ntemperature\nThe free energy F = F0 + Fint is usually decomposed into the sum of a noninteracting\nterm F0 and an interaction contribution Fint . To evaluate the interaction contribution\nto the Helmholtz free energy we follow a familiar strategy [13] by combining a coupling\nconstant integration expression for Fint valid for uniform continuum models (~ = 1 from\nnow on),\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd2 q\nN 1\nd\u03bb\nvq S (\u03bb) (q, T ) \u2212 1 ,\n(4)\nFint (T ) =\n2\n2 0\n(2\u03c0)\nwith a fluctuation-dissipation-theorem (FDT) expression [13] for the static structure\nfactor,\nZ +\u221e\n1\n(\u03bb)\n(\u03bb)\nS (q, T ) = \u2212\nd\u03c9 coth (\u03b2\u03c9/2)Im\u03c7\u03c1\u03c1\n(q, \u03c9, T ) .\n(5)\n\u03c0n 0\nHere vq = 2\u03c0e2 /(\u01ebq) is the 2D Fourier transform of the Coulomb potential and\n\u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 . We anticipate that this version of the FDT (in which the frequency\nintegration has to be performed over the real-frequency axis) requires care in handling\nthe plasmon contribution to Fint (T ) (see discussion below).\nThe RPA approximation for Fint then follows from the RPA approximation for\n(\u03bb)\n\u03c7\u03c1\u03c1 (q, \u03c9):\n(\u03bb)\n\u03c7\u03c1\u03c1\n(q, \u03c9, T ) =\n\n\u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T )\n1 \u2212 \u03bbvq \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T )\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T ) is the noninteracting density-density response-function,\nX Z d2 k 1 + ss\u2032 cos(\u03b8k,k+q )\n(0)\n\u03c7 (q, \u03c9, T ) = g lim+\n\u03b7\u21920\n(2\u03c0)2\n2\n\u2032\ns,s =\u00b1\n\n\u00d7\n\nnF (\u03b5k,s ) \u2212 nF (\u03b5k+q,s\u2032 )\n.\n\u03c9 + \u03b5k,s \u2212 \u03b5k+q,s\u2032 + i\u03b7\n\n(7)\n\nHere \u03b5k,s = svF k are the Dirac band energies and nF (\u03b5) = {exp[\u03b2(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03bc0 )] + 1}\u22121 is the\nusual Fermi-Dirac distribution function, \u03bc0 = \u03bc0 (T ) being the noninteracting chemical\npotential. As usual, this is determined by the normalization condition\nZ +\u221e\n\u03bc0 (T ) =\nd\u03b5 \u03bd(\u03b5)nF (\u03b5) ,\n(8)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\fFinite-temperature Screening and the Specific Heat of Doped Graphene Sheets\n\n4\n\nwhere \u03bd(\u03b5) = g\u03b5/(2\u03c0vF2 ) is the noninteracting density of states. For T \u2192 0 one finds\n\u03bc0 (T ) = \u03b5F \u2212 \u03c0 2 (T /TF )2 /6, where TF = \u03b5F/kB is the Fermi temperature. The factor in\nthe first line of Eq. (7), which depends on the angle \u03b8k,k+q between k and k+q, describes\nthe dependence of Coulomb scattering on the relative chirality ss\u2032 of the interacting\nelectrons.\nAfter some straightforward algebraic manipulations we arrive at the following\nexpressions for the imaginary [Im \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T )] and the real [Re \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T )] parts\nof the noninteracting density-density response function for \u03c9 > 0:\n\u001a\ng X\n(0)\n\u0398(vF q \u2212 \u03c9)q 2f (vF q, \u03c9)\nIm \u03c7 (q, \u03c9, T ) =\n4\u03c0 \u03b1=\u00b1\nh\ni\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\n\u00d7 G+ (q, \u03c9, T ) \u2212 G\u2212 (q, \u03c9, T )\ni\u001b\nh \u03c0\n(\u03b1)\n2\n+ \u0398(\u03c9 \u2212 vF q)q f (\u03c9, vFq) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1,\u2212 + H+ (q, \u03c9, T )\n2\n(9)\nand\n\u001a\ng X \u22122kB T ln[1 + e\u03b1\u03bc0 /(kB T ) ]\nRe \u03c7 (q, \u03c9, T ) =\n+ \u0398(\u03c9 \u2212 vF q)\n4\u03c0 \u03b1=\u00b1\nvF2\nh\ni\n(\u03b1)\n(\u03b1)\n\u00d7 q 2 f (\u03c9, vFq) G\u2212 (q, \u03c9, T ) \u2212 G+ (q, \u03c9, T )\ni\u001b\nh \u03c0\n(\u03b1)\n2\n.\n+ \u0398(vF q \u2212 \u03c9)q f (vF q, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1,\u2212 + H\u2212 (q, \u03c9, T )\n2\n(10)\n(0)\n\nHere\n1\nf (x, y) = p\n,\n2 x2 \u2212 y 2\nZ \u221e\n(\u03b1)\nG\u00b1 (q, \u03c9, T ) =\ndu\n1\n\n(11)\n\u221a\n\nexp\n\n\u0012\n\nand\n(\u03b1)\nH\u00b1 (q, \u03c9, T )\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nu2 \u2212 1\n\u0013\n,\n|vF qu \u00b1 \u03c9| \u2212 2\u03b1\u03bc0\n+1\n2kB T\n\ndu\nexp\n\n\u0012\n\n1 \u2212 u2\n\u0013\n.\n|vF qu \u00b1 \u03c9| \u2212 2\u03b1\u03bc0\n+1\n2kB T\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nThese semi-analytical expressions for Re \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T ) and Im \u03c7(0) (q, \u03c9, T ) constitute\nthe first important result of this work.

(4) can be carried out partly analytically\ndue to the simple RPA expression (6).

Note that in a usual 2D EG the\nexchange energy starts to matter little for T of order TF because all the occupation\nnumbers are small and the Pauli exclusion principle matters little. In the graphene case\nhowever exchange interactions with the negative energy sea remain important as long\nas T is small compared to vF kc /kB = TF \u039b.\nThe free energy calculated according to Eq. (14) is divergent since it includes the\ninteraction energy of the model's infinite sea of negative energy particles. Following\nVafek [11], we choose the free energy at T = 0, f (T = 0), as our \"reference\" free\nenergy, and thus introduce the regularized quantity \u03b4f \u2261 f (T ) \u2212 f (T = 0). This\nagain can be decomposed into the sum of a noninteracting contribution, \u03b4f0 (T \u2192\n0) = \u2212g\u03b5F \u03c0 2 (T /TF )2 /12, and an interaction-induced contribution \u03b4fint (T ) = fint (T ) \u2212\nfint (T = 0), which can be calculated from Eq. (14). Numerical results for \u03b4fint (T ) as a\nfunction of the reduced temperature T /TF are presented in the left panel of Fig. 4.\nThe low-temperature behavior of the interaction contribution to the free energy can\nbe extracted analytically with some patience.

Right\npanel: the specific heat CV (T ) (in units of kB ) as a function of T /TF .\n\nBefor concluding this Section, we remind the reader that in Ref. [6] it has been\nproven that the renormalized RPA quasiparticle velocity v \u22c6 is given, at weak coupling\nand to leading order in \u039b, by\n\u03b1gr [1 \u2212 \u03b1gr \u03be(\u03b1gr )]\nv\u22c6\n=1+\nln \u039b .\nvF\n4g\n\n(17)\n\n3. The specific heat and the compressibility\nThe specific heat can be calculated from the second derivative of the Helmholtz free\nenergy, CV = \u2212T \u2202 2 [n\u03b4f (T )]/\u2202T 2 \u2021. Numerical results for CV (T ) as a function\nof temperature are reported in Fig. 4. We thus see that \u03b4fint (T \u2192 0) \u221d T 2 in\nEq. (15) implies a conventional Fermi-liquid behavior with a linear-in-T specific heat.\nMoreover, comparing Eq. (15) with Eq. (17) we find that the ratio between CV and its\n(0)\nnoninteracting value CV is given by\nlim\n\nCV\n\nT \u21920 C (0)\nV\n\n=\n\nvF\n,\nv\u22c6\n\n(18)\n\na well-known property of normal Fermi liquids [12, 13]. We are thus led to conclude, in\nfull agreement with the zero-temperature calculations of the quasiparticle energy and\nlifetime performed in Refs. [6, 7], that doped graphene sheets are normal Fermi liquids.\nNote that the fact that interactions enhance the quasiparticle velocity [see Eq. (17)]\nimplies that the specific heat of doped graphene sheets is suppressed with respect to its\nnoninteracting value.\nThe compressibility can be calculated from the following equation\n1\n\u2202 2 [n\u03b4fint (T )]\n1\n=\n+\n,\nn2 \u03ba(T )\nn2 \u03ba0 (T )\n\u2202n2\n\n(19)\n\n\u2021 The second derivative is calculated using the full temperature dependent free-energy of the noninteracting system, \u03b4f0 (T ), and not its analytical expression reported above that is valid only for\nT \u226a TF .\n\n\fFinite-temperature Screening and the Specific Heat of Doped Graphene Sheets\n1\n\nT = 0.0 TF\nT = 0.1 TF\nT = 0.2 TF\n\n0.95\n\n\u03ba(T )/\u03ba0(T )\n\n8\n\n0.9\n0.85\n0.8\n\n\u039b = 102\n\n0.75\n0.7\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\u03b1gr\nFigure 5.

Conclusions\nIn this work we have presented semi-analytical expressions for the real and the imaginary\nparts of the density-density linear-response function of noninteracting massless Dirac\nfermions at finite temperature. These results are very useful to study finite-temperature\nscreening within the Random Phase Approximation. For example they can be used to\ncalculate the conductivity at finite temperature within Boltzmann transport theory and\nmake quantitative comparisons with recent experimental results in unsuspended [14, 15]\nand suspended graphene sheets [16, 17].\nThe Lindhard function at finite temperature is also extremely useful to calculate\nfinite-temperature equilibrium properties of interacting massless Dirac fermions, such\nas the specific heat and the compressibility. For example, in this work we have been\nable to show that, at low temperatures, the specific heat of interacting massless Dirac\nfermions has the usual normal-Fermi-liquid linear-in-temperature behavior, with a slope\nthat is solely controlled by the renormalized quasiparticle velocity.\nAcknowledgments\nM.P. was partly supported by the CNR-INFM \"Seed Projects\".\n\n\fFinite-temperature Screening and the Specific Heat of Doped Graphene Sheets\n\n9\n\nReferences\n[1] Geim A K and Novoselov K S 2007 The rise of graphene Nature Mater. 6 183; Exploring graphene\n- Recent research advances, Solid State Commun. 143 (2007), edited by Das Sarma S, Geim\nA K, Kim P, and MacDonald A H; Castro Neto A H, Guinea F, Peres N M R, Novoselov K S\nand Geim A K 2007 The electronic properties of graphene arXiv:0709.1163 [to appear in Rev.\nMod.
