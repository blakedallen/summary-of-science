INTRODUCTION\n\nAbout 5% of all hot subdwarf stars (sdB, sdO)\nshow He-enriched surface abundances (He-sdB, He-sdO).\nWhile most normal H-rich subdwarfs are supposed to be\nlow mass core He-burning stars with atmospheres dominated by H due to the action of gravitational settling, the\nevolutionary status of the He-rich subclass is less clear.\nHe-rich subdwarfs have been suggested to be the result\nof either He white dwarf mergers (Saio & Jeffery 2000)\nor late helium core flashes (Brown et al. 2001). Regardless the particular scenario proposed for their formation,\nit is accepted that some of these stars are still contracting towards the He-core burning phase (EHB), as otherwise gravitational settling of the remaining H would have\nturned the star into a H-rich sdB star.\nTwo families of pulsators have been discovered\nwithin the H-rich sdB stars: the rapid pulsators (sdBVr; Kilkenny et al. 2010) discovered by Kilkenny et al.\n(1997), and the slow pulsators (sdBVs; Kilkenny et al.\n2010) discovered by Green et al. (2003). While sdBVr\nstars show short pulsation periods (\u223c 80 \u2212 400 s) ascribed to radial modes and non-radial p-modes, sdBVs\npulsations (with periods \u223c 2500 \u2212 7000 s) are associated to non-radial long period g-modes. Pulsations in\nboth groups of variable stars have been explained by\nthe action of the \u03ba-mechanism due to the partial ionization of iron group elements in the outer layers, where\nthese elements are enhanced by the action of radiative\nlevitation (Charpinet et al. 1997; Fontaine et al. 2003).\nWhile many sdBV stars are known, only one He-sdB\nstar, LS IV-14\u25e6 116, has been found to be a pulsator\n(Ahmad et al. 2004; Ahmad & Jeffery 2005). In fact, LS\nIV-14\u25e6 116 is a very intriguing object: while its atmospheric parameters (Teff and g) place it well within the\nsdBVr instability region (Naslim et al. 2010; Green et al.\nElectronic address: mmiller@fcaglp.unlp.edu.ar\n\n2011), it displays periods typical of the sdBVs family\nof pulsators (Ahmad & Jeffery 2005; Green et al. 2011).\nFrom a spectroscopical perspective, LS IV-14\u25e6 116 is\nalso an intriguing object, showing a mild He-enrichment\n(nHe = 0.16) and very high excesses of zirconium, yttrium and strontium in its atmosphere (Naslim et al.\n2011). In this sense, both the He-enrichment and the\nheavy metal excesses might be related to the effects of\nongoing diffusion before reaching diffusive equilibrium,\nthus placing the star in the pre-EHB phase. Up to now,\nthe driving mechanism behind the long period pulsations\nof LS IV-14\u25e6 116, as well as the absence of short period\npulsations, remains a mistery and the star poses a challenge to the theory of stellar pulsations (Fontaine et al.\n2008). In this connection, the recent confirmation of both\nthe multiperiodic variability and the Teff \u2212 g values for\nLS IV-14\u25e6 116 (Green et al. 2011) strongly increase the\nenigma.\nWhile most pulsations exhibited by pulsating stars (included those of sdBVs and sdBVr stars) are self excited through the classical \u03ba-mechanism, no star has\nbeen discovered so far to be excited by the \u01eb-mechanism.\nThe only possible exception are some oscillations in\n\u03b4 Scuti stars (Lenain et al. 2006) and PG 1159 stars\n(Kawaler et al. 1986; C\u00f3rsico et al. 2009), but neither of\nthese have been confirmed. In the \u01eb-mechanism, the driving is due to the strong dependence of nuclear burning\nrates on temperature. In the layers where nuclear reactions take place, thermal energy is gained at compression by the enhancement of nuclear energy liberation,\nwhile the opposite happens during the expansion phase\n(Unno et al. 1989).\nIn the present letter we show that long period g-mode\npulsations, like those observed in LS IV-14\u25e6 116, can be\nunderstood as driven by the \u01eb-mechanism acting during\nthe unstable shell burning events that take place before\nthe star settles on the He-core burning phase. In addition, our scenario might explain the intriguing absence of\n\n\fMiller Bertolami M. M., C\u00f3rsico A. H. & Althaus L.

SCENARIO AND NUMERICAL DETAILS\n\nTo explore the effects of the \u01eb-mechanism in a contracting pre He-core burning subdwarf star, we have computed the evolution of an initially 1.03 M\u2299 , Z = 0.02 star\nmodel (see Miller Bertolami et al. 2008 for details about\nthis sequence) that departs from the red giant branch\njust before the He-core flash, and experiences the flash\nas a shallow mixing hot flasher of 0.47378 M\u2299 (mild Heenrichment, Y = 0.5978; see Lanz et al. 2004 for a definition). Stellar structure and evolution equations have\nbeen solved with LPCODE stellar evolution code as in our\nprevious works (Miller Bertolami et al. 2008 and references therein). Although our computations have been\nperformed within the hot-flasher scenario, the existence\nof He-shell subflashes in both the hot-flasher and merger\nscenarios makes our approach valid regardless the actual\norigin of LS IV-14\u25e6 116.\nAs seen in Fig. 1, after the primary He-core flash (not\nshown in the figures) the star contracts towards the Hecore burning phase through a series of He-shell subflashes\n(loops in Fig. 1), evolving through the region in the\nTeff \u2212 g diagram occupied by LS IV-14\u25e6 116. For this sequence we analyzed the pulsational stability properties\nof more than 1000 stellar structure models, one every\nfive stellar evolution timesteps, covering the whole evolution from the primary He-core flash to the final settling on the He-core burning phase. For each model we\nrestricted ourselves to explore the l = 1 g-modes in the\nperiod range from 500 to 6000 s. The stability analysis of the stellar models was carried out by means of\nthe linear, nonradial, nonadiabatic pulsation code described in C\u00f3rsico et al. (2006) with the inclusion of the\n\u01eb-mechanism mode driving operating in He-burning layers as described in C\u00f3rsico et al. (2009). Two standard\nsimplifications have been introduced. We have adopted\nthe \"frozen-in convection\" approximation in the stability analysis and we have assumed that dS/dt = 0 in the\nnon-perturbed background model adopted in the computations. While the latter is not rigorously true in contracting stellar models, the timescale of the He-subflashes\n(\u223c 1000 \u2212 10000 yr) is nonetheless much longer than the\n\n16\n14\n\n5\n\n12\n5.2\n\n10\n\n5.4\n\n8\n6\n\n5.6\n\n4\n5.8\n6\n4.65\n\nshort period p-mode pulsations in LS IV-14\u25e6 116. In the\nlight of our results, LS IV-14\u25e6 116 would be the first star\nin which pulsations driven by the \u01eb-mechanism have been\ndetected, thus being the first proof that the \u01eb-mechanism\ncan indeed drive pulsations in stars.\n\n18\n\nNumber of unstable modes\n\n# subflash\n\nLog g\n\n2\n\n2\n0\n4.6\n\n4.55\n\n4.5\n\n4.45\n\nLog Teff\nFig. 1.- Evolution of our sequence before settling on the He-core\nburning phase.

To assess the validity of \"frozen-in convection\"\napproximation we computed the turn-over timescale of\nconvection at the peak of the helium flashes as\nZ Rtop\ndr\n\u03c4glo =\n,\n(1)\nv\nRbase MLT\nwhere Rbase and Rtop are the radial coordinates of the\nboundaries of the convective zone and vMLT is the velocity of the convective elements within the mixing length\ntheory of convection. As seen in the fourth column of\nTable 1, the convective turnover times are much longer\nthan the unstable periods obtained in this work (see Fig.\n2). Thus, the assumption of \"frozen-in convection\" is\nlargely justified.\n3. RESULTS\n\nIn Fig. 1 we can see how the star becames recurrently\na pulsator as it evolves towards the EHB. Our sequence\nof models is very close to the location of LS IV-14\u25e6 116\nin the Teff \u2212 g diagram. Note that no attempt to fit the\nexact location has been done, as we have just used a sequence from our previous work (Miller Bertolami et al.\n2008). It would be easy to attain a better agreement by\nconsidering a sequence with a lower He-abundance or earlier He-core flash (see Miller Bertolami et al. 2008). Fig.\n2 shows the evolution of the pulsation periods of our HesdB sequence of models. In the upper panel we depict the\nsituation found for the complete pre-EHB phase. Note\nthat, each time a subflash develops, we obtain unstable\ng-modes, with the periods getting shorter as the star experiences subsequent, deeper, subflashes. The bottom\npanel illustrates the situation for the first and strongest\nflash of the series and shows the derived e-folding times\nfor each mode.

Colored points indicate unstable\nmodes with color coding indicating the e-folding time of each unstable mode.\n\nof the excited modes getting shorter than the duration of\nthe pulse (\u03c4duration ), indicating that these modes should\nattain observable amplitudes (see also Table 1).\nWhile the whole evolution from the primary He-flash\nto the EHB takes about 2 Myr, the unstable stages add\nup to \u223c 68000 yr (see Table 1). It is worth noting that\nthis refers to the formally unstable stage, including some\nstages with somewhat long e-folding times, and that the\nactual unstable phases might be shorter. Then, within\nthis picture, we would expect the variable to non variable\nratio of He-sdB to be lower than 1/30. It is worth noting\nthat this is consistent with the fact that only one HesdB star, out of 23 studied objects, has been found to be\na variable (Ahmad & Jeffery 2005; Ahmad et al. 2004).\nAs shown in Fig. 2, most unstable modes exhibit periods\nin the range 600 \u2212 2000 s close to the periods observed in\nLS IV-14\u25e6 116 (1954-5084 s), and definitely much longer\nthan the periods displayed by sdBVr stars in the same\nregion of the Teff \u2212 g plane. In particular, it is worth noting that our models are able to reproduce the dominant\nperiodicity observed in LS IV-14\u25e6 116 (P = 1954 s).\nOur computations show that not all modes with periods within the unstable range are excited. In fact,\nonly modes with significant amplitudes in the He-burning\nshell are destabilized. This can be seen in Fig. 3 where\nthe real part of the eigenfunction \u03b4T /T and the differential work (dW/dr) for two modes with consecutive radial\norders (k = 26; stable and k = 25; unstable) are shown.\nThis behavior, in which the \u01eb-mechanism acts as a narrow\nband filter exciting only modes with large amplitudes in\nthe narrow He-burning shell region, has been reported in\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n\n\u03b4T/T (k=25, unstable)\n\u03b4T/T (k=26, stable)\n40 * \u03b4T/T (k=26, stable)\nLog \u03b5nuclear\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\nR/Rstar\n\n0.08\n\nFig. 3.- Lower Panel: Values of \u03b4T /T for two consecutive\nmodes during the first He-subflash, k = 25 (unstable) and k = 26\n(stable). For the unstable mode, the large amplitude of \u03b4T /T\nin the region of the He-burning shell can be easily appreciated.\nUpper Panel: Differential work (dW/dr) for the modes k = 25 and\nk = 26. Note the strong driving contribution of the burning shell\n(dW/dr > 0) in the case of the unstable mode. In the interest of\ncomparison we have arbitrarily magnified \u03b4T /T and dW/dr for the\nstable mode (dotted line). Brown curls indicate the location of the\nHe-flash driven convective zone.\n\nprevious works (Kawaler et al. 1986; C\u00f3rsico et al. 2009).\nIt has been mentioned (Green et al. 2011) that the effect of the enhancement of He in nonadiabatic computations in the context of the \u03ba-mechanism in sdB stars\nmight be related with the pulsations observed in LS IV14\u25e6 116. As a consequence, once might wonder to which\nextent our results are related with the \u03ba-mechanism.\nAlso, one might wonder to which extent the so called\n\"convective blocking\" mechanism (Pesnell 1987) at the\nHe-shell flash convective zone might help to destabilize\nthe modes. In order to check our results, we have carried out explicit tests by switching off the derivatives\nof \u01ebHe in our nonadiabatic computations. As expected,\nwhen the \u01eb-mechanism is turned off, all unstable modes\nshown in Fig. 2 become stable, indicating that the driving mechanism behind the unstable modes is indeed the\n\u01eb-mechanism alone.\nAs mentioned in previous paragraphs, our results suggest that the periods of unstable modes become shorter\nwhen the star experiences deeper subflashes, that is,\nwhen the burning shells move towards the core. One\nmight then wonder where should the shell be located in\norder to excite modes with periods embracing the whole\nrange of periods observed in LS IV-14\u25e6 116. In this connection, we performed a numerical experiment by artificially shifting outwards the location of the burning shell\n\n\f4\n\nMiller Bertolami M. M., C\u00f3rsico A. H. & Althaus L.

As shown in Fig. 4,\nit would be enough to shift the location of the shell to\nlog q =\u223c \u22120.37 (q := 1 \u2212 m(r)/M\u22c6 ) to excite modes with\nperiods covering the complete range of observed periods of LS IV-14\u25e6 116. Interestingly enough, this location\nis completely within the range of locations of the burning shells in the merger scenario (see figures 2 and 3\nof Saio & Jeffery 2000). Whether this means that LS\nIV-14\u25e6 116 is a post-merger object or that He-shell subflashes develop differently from that current stellar evolution models predict (as suggested by recent 3D hydrosimulations of the event; Moc\u00e1k et al. 2009) should be\nobject of further study.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have shown that the \u01eb-mechanism is able to excite\npulsations in the He-sdB star LS IV-14\u25e6 116. Although\nour computations have been performed within the hotflasher scenario, the existence of He-shell subflashes in\n\nboth the hot-flasher and merger scenarios makes our\nconclusions valid regardless the actual origin of LS IV14\u25e6 116.\nOur results strongly suggest that long period g-mode\npulsations exhibited by LS IV-14\u25e6 116 are driven by the\n\u01eb-mechanism. If so, it is the first confirmation that the\n\u01eb-mechanism can drive pulsations in stars. Interestingly,\nif LS IV-14\u25e6 116 is a star in a fast evolutionary phase\nthen iron and nickel might not have had enough time\nto accumulate in the driving region and drive p-mode\npulsations, thus explaining also the intriguing absence of\nthese modes in LS IV-14\u25e6 116 lightcurve.\nThe fact that our model covers only partially the range\nof periods observed in LS IV-14\u25e6 116 might be related to\nthe possibility that the star is a post-merger object, in\nwhich the locations of the He-flash shells are different\nfrom those of hot-flasher objects. In fact, the numerical experiment performed in the previous section suggest\nthat nonadiabatic computations of the \u01eb-mechanism on\npost-merger stellar models might show better agreement\nwith the observed periods of LS IV-14\u25e6 116. Computations of the \u01eb-mechanism in post-merger He-sdB stellar\nmodels would be very valuable.\nIn short, we have shown that the LS IV-14\u25e6 116 atmospheric values (Teff , g and nHe ), the existence of long period g-mode pulsations, and possibly the absence of the\nclassic \u03ba-mechanism p-mode pulsations can be simultaneously explained if LS IV-14\u25e6 116 is as star undergoing\na He-shell flash in its way towards the EHB.\n\nThis work has been supported by grants PIP 112200801-00904 and PICT-2010-0861 from CONICET and\nANCyT, respectively.
