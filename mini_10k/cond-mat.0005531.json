Introduction\nStudies of friction of elastomeric materials over hard surfaces have been, up to now,\nlimited to stationary sliding, although practical situations are often non stationary.\nExtensive experimental studies of the sliding friction of rubber show that the steady\nstate dynamic friction force F ss varies with temperature T and velocity V according\nto a single 'master curve' (Grosch, 1963):\nF ss (V, T ) = F ss (aT V )\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere aT is a decreasing function of temperature, characteristic of the bulk viscoelastic properties of a given elastomer (see eg. Ferry, 1970). Furthermore (Grosch,\n1963) for materials with widely different viscoelastic properties, this curve shows\na single peak for smooth tracks (plane glass) with its maximum occurring at a\nvelocity Vs such that Vs /fG\u2032\u2032 (where fG\u2032\u2032 is the frequency at which the bulk loss\nmodulus is maximum) defines a length ds of molecular size. For rough tracks, a\nsecond peak appears, with its maximum at a velocity Vh such that Vh /f\u03b4 (where f\u03b4\nis the frequency at which the bulk loss tangent is maximum), defines a length dh of\nthe order of the track roughness. Two different mechanisms were associated with\nthese two length scales, one attributed to adhesion loss involving interfacial molecular bonds, the other one to viscoelastic dissipation within the bulk of the asperities.\nFor the adhesion component, the mechanism by which a frequency characteristic\nof the bulk might be involved is not clear, and several theories where proposed to\nexplain the bell shaped master curve observed.\n\u2020 To whom correspondence should be addressed\n\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\nTEX Paper\n\n\f2\n\nO. Ronsin & K. Labastie Coeyrehourcq\n\nFollowing the seminal adhesion theory of metal friction of Bowden and Tabor\n(1950), Ludema & Tabor (1966) described the adhesive friction force between a\nspherical hard indenter and a flat viscoelastic surface as a combination of two\nphysical terms :\nF = \u03c3s \u03a3r\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u03a3r is the real area of contact and \u03c3s is a mean interfacial shear stress required\nto break junctions. In their single Hertz contact geometry, the area of contact varies\nas \u03a3r \u221d E(t0 )\u22122/3 where E is the time dependent Young modulus evaluated at\nthe time t0 necessary for the contact to travel its own size at velocity V , namely\nt0 = a/V where a is the contact size. As the viscoelastic modulus obeys a timetemperature equivalence with a shift factor aT and increases with reduced time\nt/aT , \u03a3r increases with t0 /aT and decreases, in stationary sliding, with V . The\nshear stress \u03c3s is expected to increase with the reduced shear rate aT \u01eb\u0307 as observed\nin bulk tensile fracture experiments on the same kind of elastomers (Smith 1958).\nAssuming that the shear is accommodated in a thin interfacial layer of thickness h,\n\u01eb\u0307 = V /h, and \u03c3s increases with aT V . Finally, the friction force reads\nF ss (aT V ) = \u03c3(aT V )\u03a3(t0 /aT = a/(aT V ))\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhich produces a bell shaped curve with a position of the maximum in good agreement with experimental results, provided that h is chosen to be of order 10 nm\n(Ludema & Tabor, 1966).\nSavkoor (1987) used a similar approach to describe friction of rough surfaces,\nas the result of the statistical averaging, over the contact population, of a single\nmicrometric contact response. He analyzed the two effects, with a more detailed description of the evolution of the contact area, and introduced a fracture mechanics\ndescription of the shear strength, based on a Griffith-like energetic criterion for failure of the contact. This theory, though leading to the correct qualitative behavior,\ndepends highly on details such as geometric characteristics of the surfaces.\nAnother approach, proposed by Schallamach (1953, 1963) focuses on the interfacial term, which is described as thermally activated formation and breaking of\nbonds between rubber molecules and the hard substrate. This yields a mean force\nnecessary to break bonds that increases with velocity, but a number of bonds that\ndecreases with velocity, leading to a global friction force that qualitatively has the\nobserved bell shape.\nIn all these approaches, adhesive friction is viewed as a competition between\ntwo effects : the material strength (force to break a bond, shear strength) increasing\nwith velocity, and the amount of adhesive (number of bonds, area of contact) that\ndecreases with velocity. In steady state, these effects are mixed and thus difficult\nto separate.\nRecently, studies of non stationary friction of non elastomeric materials have\nbeen successful in separating these two contributions to the friction force. They\nconcern friction at low velocities (\u2264 100\u03bcm s\u22121 ) between macroscopically flat surfaces with a micrometric roughness, forming a multicontact interface (MCI) with\na large but dilute population of contacts. The phenomenology of these systems,\nwhich has proved to be independent to a large extent of the nature of the materials\ninvolved (granite, paper, polymer glasses), is quantitatively described by the stateand rate- dependent friction (SRF) laws first introduced by Rice & Ruina (1983).\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\fSliding friction of elastomers\n\n3\n\nThe detailed analysis of polymer glasses has shown that these laws can be interpreted through the Tabor-like decomposition (1.2) involving the real area of contact\n\u03a3r and the interfacial shear strength \u03c3s . For multicontact interfaces, this decomposition is particularly well suited to explain the Amontons-Coulomb proportionality\nobserved between the friction force and the normal load through a linear dependence\nof the real area of contact on normal load, coming from the statistical distribution\nof asperity heights (Greenwood & Williamson, 1966). The small variations of the\nfriction coefficient which are responsible for the dynamical stability of the system\ndepicted on figure 1 were extensively studied. They could be attributed to the evolution of the real area of contact with a \"state\" variable - a time-dependent age \u03c6\n- and to the dependence of the interfacial shear strength \u03c3s on the instantaneous\nshear rate\u2020, which is itself proportional to the instantaneous velocity \u1e8b of the slider.\nThat is, the friction force can be written :\nF (\u1e8b, \u03c6) = W \u03bc(\u1e8b, \u03c6) = \u03c3s (\u1e8b)\u03a3r (\u03c6)\n\n(1.4)\n\nThe variations of the contact area with age could be obtained by measuring the\nincrease in static friction with the time of contact tc prior to sliding. For polymer\nglasses, this is associated to the plastic creep of the load-bearing asperities, as\nobserved by direct visualization of the real area of contact (Dieterich & Kilgore,\n1994) and by quantitative comparison with the bulk plastic creep properties for\nvarious temperatures below the glass transition (Berthoud at al., 1999). In steady\nsliding, this ageing occurs during a time D0 /V where D0 is a characteristic length\nfound to be of the same order of magnitude as the mean contact size. The friction\nforce then has a form similar to Ludema & Tabor's :\nF ss (V ) = \u03c3s (V )\u03a3r (D0 /V )\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhich, at low velocity (\u2264 100 \u03bcm s\u22121 ), was found to be a decreasing function\nof velocity, leading to the existence of a bifurcation between steady sliding and\nstick-slip oscillations. This bifurcation could be analyzed quantitatively with a time\nevolution law for the state variable \u03c6 in non steady conditions that accounts for\nthe past history of the system over the length D0 , and that interpolates between\nthe static and steady state regimes :\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ t\nx(t) \u2212 x(t\u2032 )\ndt\u2032\n(1.6)\nexp \u2212\n\u03c6(t) =\nD0\n\u2212\u221e\nwhich takes the differential form :\n\u03c6\u0307 = 1 \u2212\n\n\u1e8b\u03c6\nD0\n\n(1.7)\n\nThe dependences of real area of contact on age and of shear strength on velocity\nwere found to be logarithmic :\n\u03c3s (\u1e8b)\n\u03a3r (\u03c6)\n\n= \u03c3s0 (1 + \u03b1 ln(\u1e8b/V0 ))\n= \u03a30r (1 + m ln(\u03c6/\u03c60 ))\n\n(1.8)\n(1.9)\n\n\u2020 provided that no mechanisms of strength evolution with time, such as polymer chains interdiffusion, is at work (Berthoud et al., 1999)\n\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f4\n\nO. Ronsin & K. Labastie Coeyrehourcq\n\nwith values of \u03b1 and m small compared to unity. The friction coefficient thus reduces, to first order in \u03b1 and m, to the usual SRF expression :\n\u03bc(\u1e8b, \u03c6) = \u03bc0 + A ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u1e8b\nV0\n\n\u0013\n\n+ B ln\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c60\n\n\u0013\n\n(1.10)\n\nWhen the steady state friction decreases with velocity (i.e. when B \u2212 A > 0), this\nfriction laws predicts (see Appendix A) a bifurcation from steady sliding to stickslip oscillations at low system stiffness and/or high normal loads for the system\ndepicted on figure 1, as observed experimentally. The detailed study of this bifurcation, coupled with steady state and static measurements, gives access to all the\nparameters involved in the SRF laws. This kind of analysis, performed as a function\nof temperature for polymer glasses, showed that the shear response of the contacts,\nwhich is expected to occur at the junction between asperities within a molecular\nthick layer of weaker material (confined polymer chain ends) is an activated process\nwith an activation volume of order (1 nm)3 , indicating that this nanometer thick\nlayer between the contacts slides by activated depinning of uncorrelated nanometric blocks, giving a picture very similar to Schallamach's description of interfacial\nsliding of rubbers (Schallamach, 1953, 1963).\nThis paper deals with the extension of this description of non stationary friction\nto elastomers. We show that the low velocity friction properties of a multicontact\ninterface between elastomers and rough hard glass, studied as a function of temperature, are indeed quantitatively described by the SRF laws. The viscoelastic\nproperties of the material appear through a temperature dependence of the SRF\nparameter A and B compatible with a WLF transform. This permits to separate\nclearly the shear strength and the area of contact contributions to the friction force,\nand to bridge between Tabor and Schallamach's descriptions of elastomer friction.\nThe paper is organized as follows : in the next section, we describe the experimental\nsetup. Section 3 presents the results of the static, steady state sliding and unsteady\nfriction measurements, followed by a discussion of these results within the SRF\nframework.\n\n2. Experimental\n(a) Samples\nWe studied three elastomers made of synthetic poly-isoprene, reticulated with\ndicumyl peroxide at 443 K. The glass transition temperature Tg , determined by\ndifferential scanning calorimetry, was changed by adding plasticisers (liquid paraffin\nor resin). The samples were moulded in 2.8 mm thick plates. The composition in\nmass and the glass transition temperatures of the samples are shown on table 1.\nThe dynamic mechanical properties (storage G\u2032 and loss moduli G\u2032\u2032 ) of the three\nelastomer samples were obtained in the frequency range 0.1 \u2212 750 Hz for various\ntemperatures. This permitted to perform a WLF transform (shown on figure 2(a)\nfor sample #1), leading to the shift factors aT that are presented, on figure 2 with\nthe glass transition as a reference temperature. Most of the results obtained are,\nunless stated, qualitatively independent of the sample and we will therefore present\nthe quantitative results obtained on sample #1.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f5\n\nSliding friction of elastomers\n\nTable 1.

This procedure has proved to give a reproducible rms roughness of\n1.3 \u03bcm.\nThe track (15 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 1 cm3 ) is made of rough glass prepared in the same way.\nWe use a glass track in order to avoid any dependence of the shear strength \u03c3s with\nthe contact age \u03c6 that might be caused by inter-diffusion of polymer chains.\n(b) Friction apparatus\nThe details of the experimental setup sketched on figure 1 are described in\ndetail elsewhere (Berthoud et al. 1999). The slider is driven along the track by\na translation stage, composed of a stepping motor pushing a cantilever spring of\nstiffness k. The spring pushes the slider through a cross-cylinder junction in such\nway that the contact is in the same plane as the track-slider interface. The velocity\nrange of the driving stage is V = 0.1 to 200 \u03bcm s\u22121 ensuring that frictional heating\nis negligible. The spring stiffness k was chosen to be the most compliant part of\nthe setup in order to be a control parameter of the stability of the system. Using\nthe relaxed storage modulus of the most compliant sample, we can estimate a lower\nlimit for the shear stiffness of the samples in the temperature range studied of 106\nN m\u22121 . We used cantilever springs of maximal stiffness 2.4 \u00d7 105 N m\u22121 . The force\napplied to the slider is deduced from the spring deflection measured by an eddy\ncurrent inductive transducer with a sub-micron resolution within the frequency\nrange.\nThe temperature control of the samples was achieved by gluing resistive stripes\n(total of 140 W) under the track and over the slider, each with a 100\u03a9 platinum\nprobe and a controller for thermal regulation. The elastomer temperature was also\nmeasured with a separate probe located inside it. Both track and sample where\nenclosed in a styrofoam box. The temperature was thus controlled between room\ntemperature and 370 K with 0.5 K precision. It was found that humidity has an\ninfluence on the results only when above 60% and the results presented here were\nobtained under dryer conditions.\n(c) Friction force measurement\nThis setup allows the measurement of both static and dynamic friction forces.\nThe static force Fs is defined from the peak value of the tangential force when\nloading rapidly the slider from rest. Both static and dynamic friction forces show\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f6\n\nO. Ronsin & K. Labastie Coeyrehourcq\n\nsimilar fluctuations that depend on the slider's position along the track and which\ncorrespond to long wavelength inhomogeneities of the interface. They can thus be\nremoved by measuring the friction forces \u2206F relative to dynamic friction in steady\nstate at a reference velocity Vref measured at the same position. This enabled us\nto measure the variations of friction forces with an error lower than the track\nfluctuations. The absolute value of the force is obtained by adding to \u2206F the mean\nvalue of the friction force at the reference velocity Vref over the whole track.\nFigure 3 shows the static and dynamic friction forces measured as a function of\nthe normal load W .\nThe proportionality defines the static and dynamic friction coefficients as the\nslopes \u03bcs = Fs /W and \u03bcd = Fd /W . This proportionality of the friction force to the\nnormal load is usually attributed to a linear relation between the real area of contact\nand the normal load, as expected from Greenwood's description of multicontact\ninterfaces (Greenwood & Williamson, 1966).\n\n3. Results\n(a) Static friction\nIn order to study the dependence of the static friction force on contact time tc\nprior to sliding, we follow a procedure proposed by Berthoud et al. (1999) : the slider\nis first put in steady sliding at a velocity Vref during 10 seconds in order to renew\nthe contact population. It is then stopped, remaining under tangential load for a\nresting time tc . After that time, the slider is shear-loaded at velocity Vload and the\nforce is recorded. The static friction is then defined from the peak value of the force,\nat which point the instantaneous velocity of the slider equals the loading velocity.\nIt has been shown (Berthoud et al. 1999) that the loading rate has an effect on the\nvalue of the static friction coefficient. We thus measure it at the constant loading\nrate Vload = 100\u03bcm s\u22121 . For convenience, the reference velocity Vref is chosen equal\nto the loading velocity. Figure 4 shows the static friction coefficient \u03bcs as a function\nof contact time tc for different temperatures. We find a quasi-logarithmic increase\nof the static friction with rest time, with a mean slope depending strongly on\ntemperature. In order to analyze this dependence within the SRF framework, we\ndefine a local logarithmic slope \u03b2s = d\u03bcs /d ln tc over the first two decades of time.\nFigure 5 shows the dependence of \u03b2s on T , showing a clear maximum around\n60\u25e6 C. In order to analyse the influence of temperature on this ageing effect, we\ntried to check whether it obeys a time-temperature equivalence. By applying a\ntemperature-dependent scaling 1/asT in time to each set of measurements, we could\nobtain a single 'master curve' (figure 6(a)) for the static friction coefficient :\n\u03bcs (tc , T ) = \u03bcs (tc /asT )\n\n(3.1)\n\nFurthermore, figure 6(b) shows that the shift factors asT agree quantitatively with\nthe viscoelastic bulk ones. Static ageing is thus the result of an increase of the real\narea of contact through viscoelastic creep of the load bearing asperities.\n(b) Steady state dynamic friction\nThe steady state dynamic friction coefficient \u03bcss\nd (V ) was measured for various\ntemperatures, as shown on figure 7. The friction always decreases with velocity\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\fSliding friction of elastomers\n\n7\n\nwithin the temperature range studied, but with slopes that depend on temperature.\nAgain, we define a local logarithmic slope \u03b2d = \u2212d\u03bcss\nd /d ln V between 0.1 and 10\n\u03bcm s\u22121 , which is shown as a function of temperature on figure 8. It exhibits a clear\nmaximum at about 330 K and the trend at higher temperatures indicates that \u03b2d\nmight become negative. As for static friction, we are able to define temperaturedependent scaling factors adT in time, with the help of which measurements at\nvarious temperatures fall on a single 'master curve' shown on figure 9(a) :\nss d\n\u03bcss\nd (V, T ) = \u03bcd (aT V )\n\n(3.2)\n\nFigure 9(b) shows that the scaling factors adT compare quantitatively with bulk ones,\nin agreement with previous sliding friction measurements on various elastomers\n(Grosch, Ludema & Tabor), although we don't see the peak that was observed in\nthese experiments. However, the saturation found at low reduced velocity indicates\nthat such a peak might be present in our system at higher temperatures.\n(c) Non stationary friction, stick-slip bifurcation\nBecause of the velocity weakening behavior of the steady friction force, stationary sliding could only be obtained under low loads and with stiff external springs.\nThe system otherwise slides through a succession of sticking and slipping phases.\nThe bifurcation between these two dynamical regimes is continuous : the amplitude of the stick-slip oscillations continuously grows from zero when increasing the\nnormal load as shown on figure 10 (a).\nFigure 10 (b) shows the dynamical phase diagram of the system in the (k/W , V )\nspace, at room temperature. The critical reduced stiffness slightly depends on the\nvelocity V as observed on other materials in the same multicontact configuration.\nThis kind of bifurcation is accounted for by the linear stability analysis of the\nSRF laws (see Appendix A). It is predicted to occur for\n\u0012 \u0013\nB\u2212A\n\u03b2d\nk\n=\n=\n(3.3)\nW c\nD0\nD0\nThe critical reduced stiffness (k/W )c was measured at a driving velocity V =\n2\u03bcm s\u22121 for various temperatures, together with the pulsation \u03a9c of the stick-slip\noscillations at the bifurcation. Using the previous measurements of the velocity\nweakening slope \u03b2d at corresponding temperatures, we can then deduce the value\nof the memory length D0 = \u03b2d /(k/W )c .\nFigure 11 shows the values obtained for different temperatures for the three\nelastomers used. Though the dispersion is large due to cumulative errors on \u03b2d and\n(k/W )c , the memory length appears independent of temperature and sample type,\nhaving an average value of D0 \u2243 1 \u03bcm, comparable with the surface roughness,\nin accordance with the geometrical interpretation of this length in terms of a slip\ndistance necessary to renew the contact population.\nThe pulsation \u03a9c gives access to the dependence of the friction coefficient on\nthe instantaneous velocity A = \u2202\u03bcd /\u2202ln \u1e8b as (see Appendix A)\n\u0012 \u0013\nV2\nk\n(3.4)\nA=\nW c D0 \u03a92c\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f8\n\nO. Ronsin & K. Labastie Coeyrehourcq\n\nIts temperature dependence is shown on figure 12. The indirectness of the measurement leads to cumulative errors that become large, but there is nevertheless a\nclear increase with temperature.\n\n4. Discussion\nWe have so far shown that the velocity weakening regime in steady sliding leading to a continuous bifurcation between steady sliding and stick-slip oscillations is\ncompatible with the phenomenological state- and rate-dependent friction laws. This\npermitted the determination of the various parameters involved. A further step can\nbe made by trying to link the dynamic response to the static threshold. Provided\nthat the loading phase is short compared to the static age tc of the multicontact\ninterface, static friction is a transient measurement at the loading velocity Vload\nwith an age tc , and following the SRF description, the static friction coefficient can\nbe written as\n\u03bcs (tc ) = \u03bc0 + A ln(Vload /V0 ) + B ln(tc /t0 )\n\n(4.1)\n\nThis implies a logarithmic dependence of the static friction on the loading velocity, which was indeed observed and found quantitatively compatible with this law\nfor polymer glasses (Berthoud et al. 1999). Furthermore, the logarithmic ageing\nslope \u03b2s should compare with B. As we have measured independently the direct\neffect parameter A, and the steady state friction slope \u03b2d = B \u2212 A, the comparison\ncan be done as shown on figure 13 where \u03b2d + A and \u03b2s are plotted for different\ntemperatures. The agreement indicates that the state-and rate-dependent friction\nmodel coherently describes the friction of rough elastomers on rough glass. Furthermore, the memory length D0 was found to be independent of either temperature or\nmaterial and to be on the order of the mean contact size. This shows that the interpretation of the age parameter in terms of real area of contact which was shown to\nhold for polymer glasses also holds here, though the physical origin of the ageing is\nclearly viscoelastic in our case, as was suggested by Ludema & Tabor (1966). This is\nconfirmed by the fact that the dependence of static friction on both time and temperature follows a time-temperature equivalence compatible with bulk viscoelastic\nmeasurements.\nThe comparison of our results with other experimental studies of steady sliding\nfriction on elastomers is limited because, with our system, we only observed velocity\nweakening behavior. However, we have seen that the saturation of \u03bcss\nd at low reduced\nvelocities (figure 9(a)) may be the trace of the maximum observed in previous\ninvestigations. We assumed that the viscoelastic dissipation due to the deformation\nof asperities while sliding was negligible compared to adhesive dissipation. This\ncan be checked by an evaluation of the deformation contribution to the friction\ncoefficient as a function of viscoelastic properties of the material and the geometric\ncharacteristics of the surfaces forming the multicontact interface. At sliding velocity\nV , the contacts are stressed during a time of the order of V /a where a is the mean\ncontact size. Such a contact will be subjected to a deformation \u01eb \u2243 a/R, where R is\nthe asperity radius of curvature, within a volume of order a3 . The energy dissipated\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\fSliding friction of elastomers\n\n9\n\nby viscoelastic losses in the contact will then be of order\na5\n(4.2)\nR2\nto the friction force such that\n\nEdef \u2243 G\u2032\u2032 (V /a) \u00d7 \u01eb2 \u00d7 a3 \u2243 G\u2032\u2032 (V /a)\nThis dissipation will result in a contribution Fdef\naFdef = Edef , or to a contact shear resistance\n\u03c3def \u2243 G\u2032\u2032\n\na2\nR2\n\n(4.3)\n\nFrom Greenwood's (Greenwood & Williamson, 1966) description of \u221a\nelastic multicontact interfaces, we can estimate the mean contact size as \u0101 \u2243 R\u03c3 and the\nmean contact pressure as\n\u0010 \u03c3 \u00111/2\n(4.4)\np\u0304 = W/\u03a3r = G\u2032\nR\nwhere \u03c3 is the characteristic length of the asperity height distribution. The deformation loss will thus give a contribution to the friction coefficient of the order\nof\n\u03c3def \u0010 \u03c3 \u00111/2\n(tan \u03b4)aT f =V /\u221a\u03c3R\n\u2243\n(4.5)\n\u03bcdef (aT V ) \u2243\np\u0304\nR\n\nThis is in agreement with the experiments of Grosch (1966) on dry silicon carbide\npaper for which \u03c3 and R are expected to be of the same order of magnitude. Note\nthat a similar result was obtained by Persson (1998) but in the limited case of very\nrough surfaces for which \u03c3 and R are of the same order of magnitude. For our\nsurfaces, these quantities, measured from surface profiles, are of order \u03c3 \u2243 1 \u03bcm\nand R \u2243 100 \u03bcm. Furthermore, the loss tangent of sample #1 has a maximum of\n0.9 about a reduced frequency aT f\u03b4 \u2243 10\u22123 Hz. The deformation component of\nfriction is thus\n\u221a expected to have a maximum of order 0.09 at a reduced velocity\naT V \u2243 aT f\u03b4 \u03c3R \u2243 10\u22122 \u03bcm s\u22121 . From figure 9, we see that there is no peak about\nthis velocity and that the measured friction is about five times higher. This is also\nthe case for the other samples and the observed friction comes clearly from adhesive mechanisms in the contact junctions. From our interpretation of this adhesive\ncomponent of friction, the change from a regime of velocity weakening to velocity\nstrengthening at high temperatures or low velocities would arise from an inefficient\nageing (state) effect compared to the rheological shear response (rate) of the interface. This gives further support to the adhesion view of Ludema & Tabor. We thus\npropose an extension of their description of elastomer friction accounting for non\nsteady dynamics as\nF (\u1e8b, \u03c6, T ) = \u03c3s (aT \u1e8b)\u03a3r (\n\n\u03c6\n)\naT\n\n(4.6)\n\nwith the time evolution of the state variable \u03c6 given by equation (1.7), which\nreduces to equation (1.3) in steady state, the contact size being averaged over the\ncontact population. We don't expect the interfacial shear strength to compare with\nthe bulk shear strength of the elastomer as no wear effect could be observed. A\nmechanism similar to Schallamach's (1953) description of interfacial friction, in\nterms of thermally activated and uncorrelated depinning of interfacial molecular\nbonds, as was proposed for glassy polymers, is more probable.\nArticle submitted to Royal Society\n\n\f10\n\nO. Ronsin & K. Labastie Coeyrehourcq\n\n5. Conclusion\nWe have shown that the non steady adhesive friction of elastomers over hard glass,\nwith a well defined surface geometry forming a multicontact interface is quantitatively described by the phenomenological state- and rate-dependent friction laws.\nThis permits the separation between the two contributions to the friction force :\nthe interfacial shear strength and the area of contact, which are mixed in steady\nsliding. This extends Ludema & Tabor's (1966) description of elastomers friction in\nterms of an interfacial shear strength similar to that invoked by Schallamach (1953,\n1963), and a real area of contact that was shown to evolve through viscoelastic\ncreep within the bulk of the contacting asperities leading to memory effects over a\nlength characteristic of the mean contact size.\nWe are grateful to T.
