VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\nANDREI MOROIANU\nAbstract. Motivated by the possible characterization of Sasakian manifolds in terms\nof twistor forms, we give the complete classification of compact Riemannian manifolds\ncarrying a Killing vector field whose covariant derivative (viewed as a 2\u2013form) is a\ntwistor form.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 53C55, 58J50.\nKeywords: Killing vector fields, twistor forms, gradient conformal vector fields.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe concept of twistor forms on Riemannian manifolds was introduced and intensively\nstudied by the Japanese geometers in the 50's. Some decades later, theoretical physicists\nbecame interested in these objects, which can be used to define quadratic first integrals\nof the geodesic equation, (cf. Penrose and Walker [9]) or to obtain symmetries of field\nequations (cf. [2], [3]). More recently, a new impetus in this direction of research was\ngiven by the work of Uwe Semmelmann [10] (see also [1], [6], [7]).\nRoughly speaking, a twistor form on a Riemannian manifold M is a differential p\u2013\nform u such that one of the three components of its covariant derivative \u2207u with respect\nto the Levi\u2013Civita connection vanishes (the two other components can be identified\nrespectively with the differential du and codifferential \u03b4u). If moreover the codifferential\n\u03b4u vanishes, u is called a Killing form. For p = 1, twistor forms correspond to conformal\nvector fields and Killing forms correspond to Killing vector fields via the isomorphism\nbetween T \u2217 M and T M induced by the metric.\nTwo basic examples of manifolds carrying twistor forms are the round spheres and\nSasakian manifolds, cf. [10, Prop. 3.2 and Prop. 3.4]. A common feature of these\nexamples is the existence of Killing 1\u2013forms whose exterior derivatives are twistor 2\u2013\nforms.\nConversely, if \u03be is a Killing 1\u2013form of constant length with twistor derivative, then it\ndefines a Sasakian structure (see Proposition 2.3 below). It is therefore natural to drop\nthe assumption on the length, and to address the question of classifying all Riemannian\nmanifolds with this property.\nAfter some preliminaries on twistor forms in Section 2, we study the behaviour of\nclosed twistor 2\u2013forms with respect to the curvature tensor in Section 3. This is used\n1\n\n\f2\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\nto obtain the following dichotomy in Section 4: if \u03be is a Killing 1\u2013form with twistor\nexterior derivative, then either \u03be satisfies a Sasaki\u2013type equation, or its kernel is an\nintegrable distribution on M. The two possibilities are then studied in the last four\nsections, where in particular new examples of Riemannian manifolds carrying twistor\n2\u2013forms are exhibited. A complete classification is obtained in the compact case, cf.\nTheorem 8.9.\nAcknowledgments. It is a pleasure to thank Paul Gauduchon and Christophe\nMargerin for many enlightening discussions.\n2. Preliminaries\nLet (M n , g) be a Riemannian manifold. Throughout this paper vectors and 1\u2013forms\nas well as endomorphisms of T M and two times covariant tensors are identified via the\nmetric. In the sequel, {ei } will denote a local orthonormal basis of the tangent bundle,\nparallel at some point. We use Einstein's summation convention whenever subscripts\nappear twice.\nWe refer the reader to [10] for an extensive introduction to twistor forms. We only\nrecall here their definition and a few basic properties.\nDefinition 2.1. A p\u2013form u is a twistor form if and only if it satisfies the equation\n\u2207X u =\n\n1\n1\nX y du \u2212\nX \u2227 \u03b4u,\np+1\nn\u2212p+1\n\n(1)\n\nfor all vector fields X, where du denotes the exterior derivative of u and \u03b4u its codifferential. If, in addition, u is co\u2013closed (\u03b4u = 0) then u is said to be a Killing form.\nBy taking one more covariant derivative in (1) and summing over an orthonormal\nbasis X = ei we see that every twistor p\u2013form satisfies\n\u2207\u2217 \u2207u =\n\n1\n1\n\u03b4du +\nd\u03b4u.\np+1\nn\u2212p+1\n\nTaking p = 1 and \u03b4u = 0 in this formula shows that\n\n1\n\u2207\u2217 \u2207u = \u2206u,\n(2)\n2\nfor every Killing 1\u2013form u. For later use we also recall here the usual Bochner formula\nholding for every 1\u2013form u:\n\u2206u = \u2207\u2217 \u2207u + Ric(u).\n(3)\nDefinition 2.2. A Sasakian structure on M is a Killing vector field \u03be of constant length,\nsuch that\n\u0001\n\u22072X,Y \u03be = k h\u03be, Y iX \u2212 hX, Y i\u03be ,\n\u2200 X, Y \u2208 T M,\n(4)\nfor some positive constant k.\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n3\n\nNotice that we have extended the usual definition (which assumes k = 1 and \u03be of unit\nlength) in order to obtain a class of manifolds invariant through constant rescaling.\nIf we denote by u the 2\u2013form corresponding to the skew\u2013symmetric endomorphism\n\u2207\u03be, then (4) is equivalent to\n\u2207X u = k\u03be \u2227 X,\n\nk > 0.\n\n(5)\n\nIn particular, if \u03be defines a Sasakian structure, then d\u03be is a closed twistor 2\u2013form, a fact\nwhich was noticed by U. Semmelmann (cf. [10, Prop. 3.4]). As a partial converse, we\nhave the following characterization of Sasakian manifolds:\nProposition 2.3. Let \u03be be a Killing vector field of constant length on some Riemannian\nmanifold such that d\u03be is a twistor 2\u2013form. Then \u03be is either parallel or defines a Sasakian\nstructure on M.\nProof. We may assume that \u03be has unit length. Let us denote by u the covariant derivative of \u03be\n\u2207X \u03be =: u(X),\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 T M.\n\n(6)\n\nIt is a direct consequence of the Kostant formula that u is parallel in the direction of \u03be\n(see Section 4 for details). Since u is a closed twistor form, we have\n\u2207X u =\n\n1\nX \u2227 \u03b4u,\nn\u22121\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 T M,\n\nwhereas for X = \u03be we get that \u03b4u is collinear to \u03be. Since \u03be never vanishes, there exists\nsome function f on M such that\n\u2207X u = f X \u2227 \u03be,\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 T M.\n\n(7)\n\nOn the other hand, \u03be has unit length so u(\u03be) = 0. Differentiating this last relation with\nrespect to some arbitrary vector X and using (6) and (7) yields\nu2 (X) = f X \u2212 f hX, \u03bei\u03be,\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 T M,\n\n(8)\n\nand in particular the square norm of u (as tensor) is\nhu, ui := hu(ei ), u(ei )i = \u2212hu2 (ei ), ei i = (1 \u2212 n)f.\nOn the other hand, (6) yields for every X \u2208 T M\n\u2207X (hu, ui) = 2f hX \u2227 \u03be, ui = 4f u(X, \u03be) = 0.\nThus f is a constant, non\u2013positive by (8). If f = 0, \u03be is parallel, otherwise \u03be defines a\nSasakian structure by (7).\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\n3. Closed twistor 2\u2013forms\nIn this section (M n , g) is a (not necessarily compact) Riemannian manifold of dimension n > 3. We start with the following technical result\nProposition 3.1. Let u be a closed twistor 2\u2013form, identified with a skew\u2013symmetric\nendomorphism of T M. Then, for every other skew\u2013symmetric endomorphism \u03c9 of T M\none has\n(n \u2212 2)(R\u03c9 \u25e6 u \u2212 u \u25e6 R\u03c9 ) = (Ru \u25e6 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u25e6 Ru ) + (u \u25e6 Ric \u25e6 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u25e6 Ric \u25e6 u),\n\n(9)\n\nwhere R\u03c9 is the skew\u2013symmetric endomorphism of T M defined by\n1\nR\u03c9 (X) := Rej ,\u03c9(ej ) X.\n2\n\nProof. The identification between 2\u2013forms and skew\u2013symmetric endomorphisms is given\nby the formula\n1\nu = ei \u2227 u(ei ).\n(10)\n2\nDepending on whether u is viewed as a 2\u2013form or as an endomorphism, the induced\naction of the curvature on it reads\nR\u03c9 (u) = R\u03c9 ek \u2227 u(ek )\n\nand\n\nR\u03c9 (u) = R\u03c9 \u25e6 u \u2212 u \u25e6 R\u03c9 .\n\n(11)\n\nLet X and Y be vector fields on M parallel at some point. Differentiating the twistor\nequation satisfied by u\n1\nY \u2227 \u03b4u\n\u2200 Y \u2208 TM\n(12)\n\u2207Y u =\n1\u2212n\nin the direction of X yields\n1\n1\nY \u2227 \u2207X \u03b4u =\nY \u2227 ej y \u22072X,ej u\n\u22072X,Y u =\n1\u2212n\nn\u22121\n1\n1\n=\nY \u2227 ej y RX,ej u +\nY \u2227 ej y \u22072ej ,X u\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n1\n1\n1\n=\nY \u2227 ej y RX,ej u +\nY \u2227 ej y \u2207ej (\nX \u2227 \u03b4u)\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\n1\u2212n\n1\n1\n=\nY \u2227 ej y RX,ej u \u2212\nY \u2227 \u2207X \u03b4u\nn\u22121\n(n \u2212 1)2\n1\n1\nY \u2227 ej y RX,ej u +\n\u22072X,Y u,\n=\nn\u22121\nn\u22121\nwhence\n1\n\u22072X,Y u =\nY \u2227 ej y RX,ej u.\n(13)\nn\u22122\nUsing the first Bianchi identity we get\n1\n1\nRu (X) = Rej ,u(ej ) X = (RX,u(ej ) ej + Rej ,X u(ej )) = RX,u(ej ) ej .\n2\n2\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n5\n\nThis, together with (11) and (13) yields\n(n \u2212 2)\u22072X,Y u = Y \u2227 ej y RX,ej ek \u2227 u(ek )\n= g(ej , RX,ej ek )Y \u2227 u(ek ) \u2212 Y \u2227 RX,u(ek ) ek\n= \u2212Y \u2227 u(Ric(X)) \u2212 Y \u2227 Ru (X).\n\nAfter skew\u2013symmetrizing in X and Y we get\n\n(n \u2212 2)RX,Y u = X \u2227 u(Ric(Y )) + X \u2227 Ru (Y ) \u2212 Y \u2227 u(Ric(X)) \u2212 Y \u2227 Ru (X).\n\nLet now \u03c9 be some skew\u2013symmetric endomorphism of T M. We take X = ei , Y = \u03c9(ei )\nin the previous equation and sum over i to obtain:\n1\n(n \u2212 2)R\u03c9 (u) =\nei \u2227 u(Ric(\u03c9(ei ))) + ei \u2227 Ru (\u03c9(ei ))\n2\n\u0001\n\u2212\u03c9(ei ) \u2227 u(Ric(ei )) \u2212 \u03c9(ei ) \u2227 Ru (ei )\n= ei \u2227 u(Ric(\u03c9(ei ))) + ei \u2227 Ru (\u03c9(ei ))\n= (u \u25e6 Ric \u25e6 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u25e6 Ric \u25e6 u) + (Ru \u25e6 \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9 \u25e6 Ru ),\n\ntaking into account that for every endomorphism A of T M, the 2\u2013form ei \u2227 A(ei )\ncorresponds to the skew\u2013symmetric endomorphism A \u2212tA of T M.\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 3.2. If u is a closed twistor 2\u2013form, the square of the endomorphism corresponding to u commutes with the Ricci tensor:\nu2 \u25e6 Ric = Ric \u25e6 u2 .\nProof. Taking \u03c9 = u in (9) yields\n(n \u2212 3)(Ru \u25e6 u \u2212 u \u25e6 Ru ) = 0,\n\nso u and Ru commute (as we assumed n > 3).

Killing vector fields with twistor derivative\nWe will use the general results above in the particular setting which interests us.

Notice that in contrast to Proposition 2.3, we no\nlonger assume the length of \u03be to be constant.

We denote by f the function defined on the support of \u03be\nsatisfying (1 \u2212 n)\u03b4u = f \u03be (this normalization turns out to be the most convenient one\nin the computations below). On the support of \u03be the twistor equation (12) then reads\nRecall now the formula\n\n\u2207X u = f X \u2227 \u03be,\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 T M.\n\n(20)\n\n(n \u2212 2)\u22072X,Y u = \u2212Y \u2227 u(Ric(X)) \u2212 Y \u2227 Ru (X)\n\nobtained in the previous section.

More explicitly, |u|2 = 21 hu(ei ), u(ei )i. Taking the\nexterior derivative in (23) yields\n0 = df \u2227 d(|\u03be|2) = \u22122df \u2227 u(\u03be),\n\n(24)\n\nwhich, together with (22) leads to\nu(df ) \u2227 \u03be = 0.\n\n(25)\n\nThe main goal of this section is to show the following\nProposition 4.1. Either f is constant on M, or u has rank 2 on M and \u03be \u2227 u = 0.\nProof. Suppose that f is non\u2013constant. Since the support of \u03be (say M0 ) is a dense open\nsubset of M, there exists a non\u2013empty connected open subset U of M0 where df does\nnot vanish. We restrict to U for the computations below. First, (24) shows that u(\u03be) is\ncollinear to df , which, together with (25) implies that\nu2 (\u03be) = \u03b1\u03be,\n\n(26)\n\nfor some function \u03b1 defined on U.\nDifferentiating this relation with respect to some vector X and using (15) and (20)\nyields\n(X \u2227 f \u03be)(u(\u03be)) + u((X \u2227 f \u03be)(\u03be)) + u3 (X) = \u03b1u(X) + X(\u03b1)\u03be,\n\nor equivalently\n\nu3 (X) \u2212 (f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1)u(X) = (X(\u03b1) \u2212 f hX, u(\u03be)i)\u03be \u2212 f hX, \u03beiu(\u03be).\n\n(27)\n\nIn terms of endomorphisms of T M, identified with (2, 0)\u2013tensors, (27) becomes\nu3 \u2212 (f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1)u = (d\u03b1 \u2212 f u(\u03be)) \u2297 \u03be \u2212 f \u03be \u2297 u(\u03be).\nThe left hand side of this relation is clearly skew\u2013symmetric. The symmetric part of\nthe right hand side thus vanishes: (d\u03b1 \u2212 2f u(\u03be)) \u2299 \u03be = 0, whence d\u03b1 = 2f u(\u03be)) on U.\nUsing (23) we get d\u03b1 = \u2212d(|u|2), so\n\u03b1 = \u2212|u|2 + c\n\n(28)\n\nfor some constant c. We now use (27) in order to compute the trace of the symmetric\nendomorphism u2 on Tx M for some x \u2208 U. It is clear that \u03be and u(\u03be) are linearly\nindependent eigenvectors of u2 with eigenvalue \u03b1. Let V denote the orthogonal complement of {\u03be, u(\u03be)} in Tx M. For X \u2208 V , (27) becomes u3 (X) \u2212 (f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1)u(X) = 0,\nso the minimal polynomial of the endomorphism u|V divides the degree 2 polynomial\n\u03bb(\u03bb \u2212 (f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1)). Thus u2 has at most 2 different eigenvalues on V : f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1 and 0,\nwith multiplicities denoted by k and n \u2212 k \u2212 2 respectively. We obtain:\n(28)\n\n\u22122|u|2 = tr(u2 ) = 2\u03b1 + k(f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1) = 2c \u2212 2|u|2 + k(f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1),\n\n\f8\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\nshowing that either f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1 is constant or k = 0. In the first case we obtain by taking\nthe exterior derivative\n0\n\n=\n(28)\n\n=\n\nd(f |\u03be|2 + \u03b1) = |\u03be|2df + f d(|\u03be|2) + d\u03b1\n(23)\n\n|\u03be|2 df + f d(|\u03be|2) \u2212 d(|u|2) = |\u03be|2df.\n\nThis shows that f is constant on U, contradicting the definition of U.\nWe therefore get k = 0. This means that the restriction of u to the distribution V\nvanishes, so\n1\n\u03be \u2227 u(\u03be)\nd\u03be = u =\n(29)\n2\n|\u03be|2\non U. In particular we get\n\u03be\u2227u= 0\n\nand\n\nu \u2227 u = 0 on U.\n\n(30)\n\nIt remains to show that the equation \u03be \u2227 u = 0 holds on the entire manifold M, not\nonly on the (possibly small) open set U. This is a consequence of the following remark.\nThe covariant derivatives of the 3\u2013form \u03be \u2227 u and of the 4\u2013form u \u2227 u can be computed\nat every point of M0 using (15) and (20):\n1\n\u2207X (\u03be \u2227 u) = u(X) \u2227 u + \u03be \u2227 (f X \u2227 \u03be) = X y (u \u2227 u)\n2\n\u2207X (u \u2227 u) = 2f X \u2227 \u03be \u2227 u.\n\nThis can be interpreted by saying that the section (\u03be \u2227 u, u \u2227 u) of \u039b3 M0 \u2295 \u039b4 M0 is\nparallel with respect to the covariant derivative D on this bundle defined by\n1\nDX (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) = (\u2207X \u03c3 \u2212 X y \u03c4, \u2207X \u03c4 \u2212 2f X \u2227 \u03c3).\n2\nSince a parallel section which vanishes at some point is identically zero, (30) implies\nthat \u03be \u2227 u vanishes identically on M0 , thus on M because M0 is dense in M.\n\u0003\nMost of the remaining part of this paper is devoted to the study of the two possibilities\ngiven by the above proposition.\n5. The case where f is constant\nIn this section we consider the case where the function f defined on the support of \u03be\nis constant and we assume that M is compact. We then have\nTheorem 5.1. If the covariant derivative u := \u2207\u03be of a non\u2013parallel Killing vector field\n\u03be on M satisfies\n\u2207X u = c\u03be \u2227 X\n(31)\nfor some constant c, then either \u03be defines a Sasakian structure on M, or M is a space\nform.\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n9\n\nProof. For the reader's convenience we provide here a proof of this rather standard fact.\nWe start by determining the sign of the constant c. From (16), (17) and (31) we obtain\nRX,\u03be Y = \u22072X,Y \u03be = (\u2207X u)(Y ) = (c\u03be \u2227 X)(Y ) = c(h\u03be, Y iX \u2212 hX, Y i\u03be).\nTaking the trace over X and Y in this formula yields\nRic(\u03be) = \u2212Rei ,\u03be ei = (n \u2212 1)c\u03be.\nNow, the two Weitzenb\u00f6ck formulas (2) and (3) applied to the Killing 1\u2013form \u03be read\n1\n1\n\u2207\u2217 \u2207\u03be = \u03b4d\u03be = \u2206\u03be\n2\n2\n\nand\n\n\u2206\u03be = \u2207\u2217 \u2207\u03be + Ric(\u03be).\n\nThus Ric(\u03be) = \u2207\u2217 \u2207\u03be so taking the scalar product with \u03be and integrating over M yields\n(n \u2212 1)c|\u03be|2L2 = |\u2207\u03be|2L2 .\nThis shows that c is non\u2013negative, and c = 0 if and only if \u03be is parallel, a case which\nis not of interest for us. By rescaling the metric on M if necessary, we can therefore\nassume that c = 1, i.e. \u03be satisfies the Sasakian condition (4)\n\u22072X,Y \u03be = h\u03be, Y iX \u2212 hX, Y i\u03be.\nIf the norm of \u03be is constant, we are in the presence of a Sasakian structure by Definition\n2.2.\nSuppose that \u03bb := |\u03be|2 is non\u2013constant. Then the function \u03bb is a characteristic\nfunction of the round sphere. More precisely, the second covariant derivative of the\n1\u2013form d\u03bb can be computed as follows. Using the relation \u2207X \u03be = u(X) we first get\nd\u03bb = \u22122u(\u03be), therefore (31) gives\n\u2207Y d\u03bb = \u22122(\u03be \u2227 Y )(\u03be) \u2212 2u2 (Y ).\nBy taking another covariant derivative with respect to some vector X (at a point where\nY is assumed to be parallel) we obtain after a straightforward calculation\n\u22072X,Y d\u03bb + 2X(\u03bb)Y + Y (\u03bb)X + d\u03bbhX, Y i = 0.\nA classical result of Tanno and Gallot (cf. [11] or [5, Corollary 3.3]), shows that if d\u03bb\ndoes not vanish identically, the sectional curvature of M has to be constant, so M is a\nfinite quotient of the round sphere.\n\u0003\nWe end up this section by remarking that conversely, every Killing vector field on\nthe round sphere (and all the more on its quotients) satisfies (14). This follows for\ninstance from [10, Prop. 3.2]. The main idea is that the space of Killing 1\u2013forms\n(respectively of closed twistor 2\u2013forms) on the sphere coincides with the eigenspace for\nthe least eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on co\u2013closed 1\u2013forms (respectively on closed\n2\u2013forms), and the exterior differential defines an isomorphism between these two spaces.\n\n\f10\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\n6. The case where \u03be \u2227 u = 0\nFrom now on we suppose that the function f defined by (20) is non\u2013constant. By\nProposition 4.1 the 3\u2013form \u03be \u2227 d\u03be vanishes on M, thus the distribution orthogonal to \u03be\n(defined on the support of \u03be) is integrable. We start by a local study of the metric, at\npoints where \u03be does not vanish.\nProposition 6.1. Around every point in the support of \u03be, the manifold M is locally\nisometric to a warped product I \u00d7\u03bb N of an open interval I and a (n \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional\nmanifold N such that the differential of the warping function \u03bb is a twistor 1\u2013form on\nN.\nProof. By the integrability theorem of Frobenius, M can be written locally as a product\n\u2202\nI \u00d7 N where \u03be = \u2202t\nand N is a local leaf tangent to the distribution \u03be \u22a5 . The metric g\ncan be written\ng = \u03bb2 dt2 + ht\nfor some positive function \u03bb on I \u00d7 N and some family of Riemannian metrics ht on\n\u2202\nN. Of course, the fact that \u03be = \u2202t\nis Killing just means that \u03bb and ht do not depend\n2 2\non t, i.e. g = \u03bb dt + h is a warped product. The 1\u2013form \u03b6, metric dual to \u03be, is just\n\u03bb2 dt, so u = 21 d\u03b6 = \u03bbd\u03bb \u2227 dt. We now express the fact that u is a twistor form on M\nin terms of the new data (\u03bb, h). Let X denote a generic vector field on N, identified\nwith the vector field on M projecting over it. Similarly, we will identify 1\u2013forms on N\nwith their pull\u2013back on M. Since the projection M \u2192 N is a Riemannian submersion,\nthese identifications are compatible with the metric isomorphisms between vectors and\n1\u2013forms.\nThe O'Neill formulas (cf. [8, p. 206]) followed by a straightforward computation give\n\u2207\u2202 u=0\n\u2202t\n\nand\n\n\u2207X u = \u03bb\u2207X d\u03bb \u2227 dt,\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 T N,\n\nwhere we denoted by the same symbol \u2207 the covariant derivative of the Levi\u2013Civita\nconnection of h on N. Taking the inner product with X in the second equation and\nsumming over an orthonormal basis of N yields \u03b4 M u = \u03bb\u2206N \u03bbdt, so u is a twistor form\nif and only if\n1\n\u2207X d\u03bb = \u2212\nX\u2206N \u03bb,\n\u2200 X \u2208 TN\nn\u22121\nwhich just means that d\u03bb is a twistor 1\u2013form on N.\n\u0003\nWe can express the above property of d\u03bb by the fact that its metric dual is a gradient\nconformal vector field on N. These objects were intensively studied in the 70's by\nseveral authors. In particular Bourguignon [4] has shown that a compact manifold\ncarrying a gradient conformal vector field is conformally equivalent to the round sphere.\nThe converse of this result does not hold (i.e. not every conformally flat metric on the\nsphere carries gradient conformal vector fields, cf. Remark 8.3 below). We study this\nnotion in greater detail in the next section.\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n11\n\n7. Gradient conformal vector fields\nDefinition 7.1. A gradient conformal vector field (denoted for convenience GCVF in\nthe remaining part of this paper) on a connected Riemannian manifold (M n , g) is a\nconformal vector field X whose dual 1\u2013form is exact: X = d\u03bb. The function \u03bb (defined\nup to a constant) is called the primitive of X.\nLet X be a GCVF. Since X is a gradient vector field, its covariant derivative is a\nsymmetric endomorphism, and the fact that X is conformal just means that the trace\u2013\nfree symmetric part of \u2207X vanishes. Thus X satisfies the equation\n\u2207Y X = \u03b1Y,\n\nwhere \u03b1 = \u2212 \u03b4X\n. In particular, L X g = 2\u03b1g.\nn\n\n\u2200 Y \u2208 TM\n\n(32)\n\nIn the neighbourhood of every point where X is non\u2013zero, the metric g can be written\ng = \u03c8(t)(dt2 + h)\n\nfor some positive function \u03c8. Conversely, if g can be written in this form, then\nGCVF whose primitive is \u03a8 (the primitive of \u03c8 in the usual sense).\n\n(33)\n\u2202\n\u2202t\n\nis a\n\nWe thus see that the existence of a GCVF does not impose hard restrictions on the\nmetric in general. Remarkably, if the GCVF has zeros, the situation is much more rigid:\nProposition 7.2. Let X be a GCVF on a Riemannian manifold (M n , g) vanishing at\nsome x \u2208 M. Then there exists an open neighbourhood of x in M on which the metric\ncan be expressed in polar coordinates\ng = ds2 + \u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22121 ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere gS n\u22121 denotes the canonical round metric on S n\u22121 and \u03b3 is some positive function\n\u03b3 : (0, \u03b5) \u2192 R+ . The norm of X in these coordinates is a scalar multiple of \u03b3:\n|X| = c\u03b3.\n\n(35)\n\nNotice that the metric defined\nR t p by (34) is in particular of type (33), as shown by the\nchange of variable s(t) := 0 \u03c8(r)dr.\n\nProof. Let \u03c4 be the unit tangent vector field along geodesics passing trough x. From\n([4, Lemma 4]) we have that X is everywhere collinear to \u03c4 . Using the Gauss Lemma,\nwe know that the metric g can be expressed as g = ds2 + hs in geodesic coordinates on\n\u2202\nsome neighbourhood U of x, where hs is a family of metrics on S n\u22121 (of course, \u03c4 = \u2202s\nin these coordinates). Since x is an isolated zero of X (cf. [4, Corollary 1]), the norm\nof X is a smooth function |X| = \u03b2 defined on U \u2212 {x}, and X = \u03b2\u03c4 . We then compute\nd\u03b2\nh \u0307s = L \u03c4 g = \u03b2 \u22121 L X g + 2d(\u03b2 \u22121) \u2299 X \u266d = 2\u03b1\u03b2 \u22121 g \u2212 2\n\u2299 ds\n\u03b2\nd\u03b2\n\u2299 ds\n= 2\u03b1\u03b2 \u22121hs + 2\u03b1\u03b2 \u22121ds2 \u2212 2\n\u03b2\n\n\f12\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\nBy identification of the corresponding terms in the above equality we obtain the differential system\n(\nd\u03b2 = \u03b1ds\nh \u0307s = 2\u03b1\u03b2 \u22121hs\nRs\nThe first equation shows that \u03b2 only depends on s: \u03b2 = \u03b2(s) = 0 \u03b1(t)dt. The second\nequation yields\nhs = \u03b2 2 (s)h\n(36)\nfor some metric h on S n\u22121 .\nWe claim that h is (up to a scalar multiple) the canonical round metric on the\nsphere. To see this, we need to understand the family of metrics hs on S n\u22121 . We\nidentify (Tx M, g) with (Rn , eucl) and S n\u22121 is viewed as the unit sphere in Tx M. If V\nis a tangent vector to S n\u22121 at some v \u2208 Tx M, then hs (V, V ) is the square norm with\nrespect to g of the image of V by the homothety of ratio s followed by the differential\nat v of the exponential map expx .

The classification\nWe turn our attention back to the original question. Recall that \u03be is a non\u2013parallel\nKilling vector field on (M n , g) such that \u03be \u2227 d\u03be = 0 and d\u03be is a twistor form. We\ndistinguish two cases, depending on whether \u03be vanishes or not on M.\nCase I. The vector field \u03be has no zero on M. The distribution orthogonal to \u03be is\nthen globally well\u2013defined and integrable, its maximal leaves turn out to be compact\nand can be used in order to obtain a dimensional reduction of our problem.\nDefinition 8.1. Let N be a Riemannian manifold, let \u03bb be a positive smooth function\non N and let \u03c6 be an isometry of N preserving \u03bb (that is, \u03bb \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03bb). The quotient of\nthe warped product R \u00d7\u03bb N by the free Z\u2013action generated by (t, x) 7\u2192 (t + 1, \u03c6(x)) is\ncalled the warped mapping torus of \u03c6 with respect to \u03bb and is denoted by N\u03bb,\u03c6 .\nProposition 8.2. A compact Riemannian manifold (M n , g) carries a nowhere vanishing Killing vector field \u03be as above if and only if it is isometric to a warped mapping\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n13\n\ntorus N\u03bb,\u03c6 where (N n\u22121 , h) is a compact Riemannian manifold carrying a GCVF with\nprimitive \u03bb and \u03c6 is an isometry of N preserving \u03bb.\nProof. The \"if\" part follows directly from the local statement given by Proposition 6.1.\nSuppose, conversely, that (M, \u03be) satisfy the conditions above. We denote by \u03c6t the flow\nof \u03be and by Nx the maximal leaf of of the integrable distribution \u03be \u22a5 . Clearly \u03c6t maps\nNx isometrically over N\u03c6t (x) . We claim that this action of R on the space of leaves of\n\u03be \u22a5 is transitive. Let x \u2208 M be an arbitrary point of M and denote\n[\nMx :=\nN\u03c6t (x) .\nt\u2208R\n\nFor every y \u2208 Mx we define a map \u03c8 : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u00d7 Ny \u2192 M by\n\u03c8(t, z) := \u03c6t (z).\n\nThe differential of \u03c8 at (0, y) is clearly invertible, thus the inverse function theorem ensures that the image of \u03c8 contains an open neighbourhood of y in M. On the other hand\nMx contains the image of \u03c8 by construction, therefore Mx contains an open neighbourhood of y. Thus Mx is open. For any x, y \u2208 M one either has Mx = My or Mx \u2229My = \u2205.\nThus M is a disjoint union of open sets\n[\nM=\nMx\nx\u2208M\n\nso by connectedness we get Mx = M for all x.\n\nSince the norm of \u03be is constant along its flow, we deduce that |\u03be| attains its maximum\nand its minimum on each integral leaf Nx . By the main theorem in [4], each leaf is\nconformally diffeomorphic to the round sphere, so in particular it is compact. Reeb's\nstability theorem then ensures that the space of leaves is a compact 1\u2013dimensional\nmanifold S and the natural projection M \u2192 S is a fibration. Hence S is connected, i.e.\nS\u223c\n= S 1 . On the other hand we have a group action of R on S given by t(Nx ) := N\u03c6t (x)\nand S is the quotient of R by the isotropy group of some point. Since S is a manifold,\nthis isotropy group has to be discrete, therefore is generated by some t0 \u2208 R. Then\nclearly M can be identified with the warped mapping torus N\u03bb,\u03c6 , where N := Nx ,\n\u03c6 := \u03c6t0 and the warping function \u03bb is the restriction to N of |\u03be|.\n\u0003\nRemark 8.3. A compact Riemannian manifold admitting gradient conformal vector\nfields is completely classified by one single smooth function defined on some closed interval and satisfying some boundary conditions. More precisely, such a manifold is\nisometric to the Riemannian completion of a cylinder (0, l) \u00d7 S n\u22122 with the metric\ndt2 + f (t)gS n\u22122 , where f : (0, l) \u2192 R+ is smooth and satisfies the boundary conditions\nf (t) = t2 (1 + t2 a(t2 )) and f (l \u2212 t) = t2 (1 + t2 b(t2 )),\n\nfor some smooth functions a, b : (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) \u2192 R+ .\n\n\u2200 |t| < \u03b5,\n\n(37)\n\nThe proof is very similar to that of Theorem 8.6 below and will thus be omitted.\n\n\f14\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\nCase II. The vector field \u03be has zeros on M. The study of this situation is more\ninvolved since the distribution orthogonal to \u03be is no longer globally defined. On the\nother hand one can prove that the orbits of \u03be are always closed in this case, which turns\nout to be crucial for the classification. This follows from a more general statement:\nProposition 8.4. Let M be a compact Riemannian manifold and let \u03be be a Killing\nvector field on M. If the covariant derivative of \u03be has rank 2 (as skew\u2013symmetric\nendomorphism) at some point x \u2208 M where \u03be vanishes, then \u03be is induced by an isometric\nS 1 \u2013action on M, and in particular its orbits are closed.\nProof. Let Z denote the set of points where \u03be vanishes, and let Z0 the connected component of Z containing x. It is well\u2013known that Z0 is a totally geodesic submanifold\nof M of codimension 2 (equal to the rank of \u2207\u03be). Moreover, at each point of Z0 , \u2207\u03be\nvanishes on all vectors tangent to Z0 .\nSince M is compact, its isometry group G is also compact. The Killing vector field \u03be\ndefines an element X of the Lie algebra g of G. The exponential map of G send the line\nRX onto a (not necessarily closed) Abelian subgroup of G. Let T be the closure of this\nsubgroup and denote by t its Lie algebra. T is clearly a compact torus. We claim that\nT is actually a circle. If this were not the case, one could find an element Y \u2208 t defining\na Killing vector field \u03b6 on M non\u2013collinear to \u03be. Let y be some point in Z0 . Since by\ndefinition \u03bey = 0 we get exp(tX) * y = y for all t \u2208 R, whence g * y = y for all g \u2208 T ,\nthus showing that \u03b6 vanishes on Z0 . Since the space of skew\u2013symmetric endomorphisms\nof Tx M vanishing on Tx Z0 is one\u2013dimensional, we deduce that (\u2207\u03b6)x is proportional to\n(\u2207\u03be)x . Finally, since a Killing vector field is determined by its 1\u2013jet at some point, and\n\u03bex = \u03b6x = 0, we deduce that \u03b6 is collinear to \u03be, a contradiction.\nTherefore T is a circle acting isometrically on M and \u03be is the Killing vector field\ninduced by this action.\n\u0003\nLet M0 denote as before the set of points where \u03be does not vanish. The integrable\ndistribution \u03be \u22a5 is well\u2013defined along M0 and T acts freely and transitively on its maximal\nintegral leaves. If (N, h) denotes such a maximal integral leaf, Proposition 6.1 shows\nthat M0 is isometric to the warped product S 1 \u00d7\u03bb N, g = \u03bb2 d\u03b82 +h, where \u03bb is a positive\nfunction on N whose gradient is a conformal vector field X. Since \u03bb is the restriction\nof the continuous function |\u03be| on M, it attains its maximum at some x \u2208 N. Of course,\nX vanishes at x.\nWe thus may apply Proposition 7.2 to the gradient conformal vector field X on N.\nThe metric on N can be written h = ds2 + \u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 on some neighbourhood of x. The\nlength of X, which by (34) is equal to c\u03b3(s), only depends on the distance to x. Assume\nthat X vanishes at some point y := expx (tV ) (where V is a unit vector in Tx N). Then\nit vanishes on the whole geodesic sphere of radius t. On the other hand X has only\nisolated zeros, so the geodesic sphere S(x, t) is reduced to y. This would imply that N\nis compact, homeomorphic to S n\u22121 , so M0 = S 1 \u00d7 N is compact, too. On the other\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n15\n\nhand M0 is open, so by connectedness M0 = M, contradicting the fact that \u03be has zeros\non M.\nThis proves that x is the unique zero of X on N. In fact we can now say much\nmore about the global geometry of M. Recall that M is the disjoint union of M0 and\nZ, where Z, the nodal set of \u03be, is a codimension 2 submanifold and M0 = N \u00d7 S 1 is\nendowed with a warped product metric. In order to state the global result we need the\nfollowing\nDefinition 8.5. Let l > 0 be a positive real number and let \u03b3, \u03bb : (0, l) \u2192 R+ be two\nsmooth functions satisfying the following boundary conditions:\n(\nlims\u21920 \u03b3(s) = 0,\nlims\u2192l \u03b3(s) > 0\n(38)\nlims\u21920 \u03bb(s) > 0,\nlims\u2192l \u03bb(s) = 0\nWe view the sphere S n as the topological join of S n\u22122 and S 1 , obtained from [0, l] \u00d7\nS\n\u00d7 S 1 by shrinking {0} \u00d7 S n\u22122 \u00d7 S 1 to {point} \u00d7 S 1 and by shrinking {l} \u00d7 S n\u22122 \u00d7 S 1\nto {point} \u00d7 S n\u22122 .\nn\u22122\n\nThen S n , endowed with the Riemannian metric\n\ng = ds2 + \u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 + \u03bb2 (s)d\u03b82\ndefined on its open submanifold (0, l) \u00d7 S n\u22122 \u00d7 S 1 is called the Riemannian join of S n\u22122\nand S 1 with respect to \u03b3 and \u03bb and is denoted by S n\u22122 \u2217\u03b3,\u03bb S 1 .\nNotice that the metric g extends to a continuous metric on S n . We will see below\nunder which circumstances this extension is smooth.\nTheorem 8.6. Let N be a maximal leaf of the distribution \u03be \u22a5 of M0 and let x \u2208 N be\nthe unique zero of the gradient conformal vector field X = \u2207(|\u03be|) on N. We then have\n\n(i) There exists some positive number l, not depending on N, such that the exponential\nmap at x maps diffeomorphically the open ball B(0, l) in Tx N onto N.\n(ii) The submanifold Z is connected, isometric to a round sphere S n\u22122 . The closure\nof each integral leaf N defined above is N = N \u222a Z.\n\n(iii) M is isometric to a Riemannian join S n\u22122 \u2217\u03b3,\u03bb S 1 , where \u03b3 is (up to a constant)\nequal to the derivative of \u03bb.\nProof. (i) Consider the isometric action of S 1 on M induced by \u03be. For \u03b8 \u2208 S 1 denote\nby N\u03b8 the image of N through the action of \u03b8 on M. Of course, N\u03b8 is itself a maximal\nintegral leaf of \u03be \u22a5 . For every unit vector V \u2208 Tx N, we define\nl(x, V ) := sup{t > 0 | expx (rV ) \u2208 N, \u2200 r \u2264 t}.\n\nClearly, l(x, V ) is the distance along the geodesic expx (tV ) from x to the first point on\nthis geodesic where X vanishes. Of course, the exponential map on N\u03b8 coincides (as\nlong as it is defined) with the exponential map on M since each N\u03b8 is totally geodesic.\n\n\f16\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\nAs noticed before, the norm of X along geodesics issued from x only depends on the\nparameter along the geodesic, therefore l(x, V ) is independent of V and can be denoted\nby l(x). Since we have a transitive isometric action on the N\u03b8 's, l(x) actually does not\ndepend on x neither, and will be denoted by l. This proves that each N\u03b8 is equal to the\nimage of the open ball B(0, l) in T\u03b8(x) N\u03b8 via the exponential exp\u03b8(x) .\n(ii) Let us denote by Z\u03b8 the set N\u03b8 \\ N\u03b8 . By the above, Z\u03b8 is the image of the\nround sphere S(0, l) in T\u03b8(x) N\u03b8 \u2282 T\u03b8(x) M via the exponential map (on M) exp\u03b8(x) . In\nparticular, each Z\u03b8 is a connected subset of Z, diffeomorphic to S n\u22122 . Every element\n\u03b8\u2032 \u2208 S 1 maps (by continuity) Z\u03b8 to Z\u03b8\u2032 \u03b8 and on the other hand, it preserves Z. We\ndeduce that Z\u03b8 = Z\u03b8\u2032 for all \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 S 1 and since Z is the union of all Z\u03b8 , we obtain\nZ = Z\u03b8 . The other assertions are now clear.\n(iii) This point is an implicit consequence of the local statements from the previous\nsections. First, by Proposition 6.1 M0 is diffeomorphic to N \u00d7 S 1 with the warped\nproduct metric g = gN + \u03bb2 d\u03b82 , where \u03bb is a function on N whose gradient X is a\nGCVF vanishing at x. From Proposition 7.2 and (i) above we see that N \\ {x} is\ndiffeomorphic to (0, l) \u00d7 S n\u22122 with the metric gN = ds2 + \u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 . If we denote by\nS the orbit of x under the S 1 \u2013action on M defined by \u03be, this shows that M0 \\ S is\ndiffeomorphic to (0, l) \u00d7 S n\u22122 \u00d7 S 1 with the metric\ng = ds2 + \u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 + \u03bb2 (s)d\u03b82 ,\n\n\u2202\nwhere \u03bb represents the norm of \u03be and X = \u2207\u03bb = \u03bb\u2032 (s) \u2202s\n. From (35) we get |\u03bb\u2032| =\n|X| = c\u03b3. Taking into account that X does not vanish on M0 \\ S, we see that \u03bb\u2032 does\nnot change sign on (0, l), so \u03b3 equals the derivative of \u03bb up to some non\u2013zero constant.\nFinally, the boundary conditions (38) are easy to check: lims\u21920 \u03b3(s) = 1c |Xx | = 0,\nlims\u2192l \u03b3(s) is equal to the radius of the round (n \u2212 2)\u2013sphere Z and is thus positive,\nlims\u21920 \u03bb(s) = |\u03bex | > 0 and lims\u2192l \u03bb(s) = 0 because \u03be vanishes on Z.\n\u0003\n\nIn order to obtain the classification we have to understand which of the above Riemannian join metrics are actually smooth on the entire manifold. For this we will use\nthe following folkloric result\nLemma 8.7. Let f : (0, \u03b5) \u2192 R+ be a smooth function such that limt\u21920 f (t) = 0. The\nRiemannian metric dt2 + f (t)gS n\u22121 extends to a smooth metric at the singularity t = 0\n1\nif and only if the function f \u0303(t) := f (t 2 ) has a smooth extension at t = 0 and f \u0303\u2032 (0) = 1.\nNotice that the above condition on f amounts to say that f (t) = t2 + t4 h(t2 ) for some\nsmooth germ h around 0.\nCorollary 8.8. Let \u03b3 : (0, l) \u2192 R+ be a smooth function satisfying lims\u21920 \u03b3(s) = 0 and\nlims\u2192l \u03b3(s) > 0. For c > 0 consider the function\nZ l\n\u03bb(s) := c\n\u03b3(t)dt.\n(39)\ns\n\n\fKILLING VECTOR FIELDS WITH TWISTOR DERIVATIVE\n\n17\n\nThe Riemannian join metric\ng = ds2 + \u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 + \u03bb2 (s)d\u03b82\ndefined on (0, l) \u00d7 S n\u22122 \u00d7 S 1 extends to a smooth metric on S n if and only if there exist\ntwo smooth functions a and b defined on some interval (\u2212\u03b5, \u03b5) such that\n1\n\u03b3(t) = t(1 + t2 a(t2 )) and \u03b3(l \u2212 t) = + t2 b(t2 ), \u2200 |t| < \u03b5.\n(40)\nc\nProof. Since \u03bb(0) > 0, g extends to a smooth metric at s = 0 if and only if ds2 +\n8.7, this is equivalent to \u03b3 2 (t) =\n\u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 extends smoothly at s = 0. By Lemma\np\n2\n4\n2\nt + t h(t ) for some smooth h, so \u03b3(t) = t 1 + t2 h(t2 ) = t(1 + t2 a(t2 )) for some\nsmooth function a. Similarly, g extends smoothly at s = l if and only if the same holds\nfor ds2 + \u03bb2 (s)d\u03b82 , which, by Lemma 8.7 is equivalent to the existence of some smooth\nfunction d defined around 0 such that \u03bb(l \u2212 t) = t + t3 d(t2 ). Taking (39) into account,\nthis is of course equivalent to the second part of (40).\n\u0003\nSummarizing, we have\nTheorem 8.9. Let (M n , g) be a compact Riemannian manifold carrying a non\u2013parallel\nKilling vector field \u03be whose covariant derivative is a twistor 2\u2013form. Then one of the\nfollowing possibilities occurs:\n1. M is a space form of positive curvature and \u03be is any Killing vector field on M.\n2. M is a Sasakian manifold and \u03be is the Sasakian vector field.\n3. M is a warped mapping torus N\u03bb,\u03c6\nM = (R \u00d7 N)/(t,x)\u223c(t+1,\u03c6(x)) ,\n\ng = \u03bb2 d\u03b82 + gN ,\n\nwhere N is is a compact (n \u2212 1)\u2013dimensional Riemannian manifold carrying a GCVF\n\u2202\nwith primitive \u03bb (cf. Remark 8.3), \u03c6 is an isometry of N preserving \u03bb and \u03be = \u2202\u03b8\n.\n4. M is a Riemannian join S n\u22122 \u2217\u03b3,\u03bb S 1 with the metric g = ds2 +\u03b3 2 (s)gS n\u22122 +\u03bb2 (s)d\u03b82\nwhere \u03b3 : (0, l) \u2192 R+ is a smooth function satisfying the boundary conditions (40), \u03bb is\n\u2202\n.\ngiven by formula (39), and \u03be = \u2202\u03b8\nWe end up these notes with some open problems related to the classification above.\nOne natural question is the following : which compact Riemannian manifolds carry\ntwistor 1\u2013forms \u03be with twistor exterior derivative? To the author's knowledge, in all\nknown examples \u03be is either closed or co\u2013closed. In the first case, the metric dual of \u03be is\na GCVF, so the manifold is described by Proposition 7.2. The second case just means\nthat \u03be is Killing, and the possible manifolds are described by Theorem 8.9.\nMore generally, one can address the question of classifying all compact Riemannian\nmanifolds M n carrying a Killing or twistor p\u2013form whose exterior derivative is a non\u2013\nzero twistor form (2 \u2264 p \u2264 n \u2212 2). Besides the round spheres, the only known examples\nare Sasakian manifolds (for odd p), nearly K\u00e4hler 6\u2013manifolds (for p = 2 and p = 3)\nand nearly parallel G2 \u2013manifolds (for p = 3).\n\n\f18\n\nANDREI MOROIANU\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
