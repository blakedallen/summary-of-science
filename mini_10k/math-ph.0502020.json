Introduction\nOne of the most fundamental problems in the theory of random matrices is to\nderive the joint density functions for the eigenvalues (or equivalently, the measures\nassociated with the eigenvalue distributions) of various types of matrix ensembles.\nIn his monograph [12], Mehta summarized the classical analysis methods by which\nthe density functions for various types of ensembles were derived case by case. But\na systematical method to compute the density functions was desired.\nThe first achievement in this direction was made by Dyson [8], who introduced an\nidea of expressing various kinds of circular ensemble in terms of symmetric spaces\nwith invariant probability measures. From then on, guided by Dyson's idea, many\nauthors observed new random matrix ensembles in terms of Cartan's classification of Riemannian symmetric spaces, and obtained the joint density functions for\nsuch ensembles using the integration formula on symmetric space (see, for example, [3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 15]). Here we mention the recent work of Due\u00f1ez [7] briefly.\nDue\u00f1ez explored the random matrix ensembles which correspond to infinite families\nof compact irreducible Riemannian symmetric spaces of type I, including circular\northogonal and symplectic ensembles and various kinds of Jacobi ensembles. Using an integration formula associated with the KAK decomposition of compact\ngroups, he obtained the induced measure on the space of eigenvalues associated\nwith the underlying symmetric space, and then derived the eigenvalue distribution of the corresponding random matrix ensemble. These methods of deriving\nthe eigenvalue distributions of random matrix ensembles by means of Riemannian\nsymmetric spaces were summarized by the excellent review article of Caselle and\nMagnea [6].\n1This work is supported by the 973 Project Foundation of China (\u266fTG1999075102).\nKeywords: Random matrix ensemble, Lie group, Integration formula.\nAMS 2000 Mathematics Subject Classifications: 15A52 (Primary); 58C35, 57S25 (Secondary)\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIn this paper we provide a generalization of the random matrix ensembles, including all classical ensembles, and then give an unified way to derive the joint density\nfunction for the eigenvalue distribution by one simple formula. The proof of this\nformula make no use of integration formula. In fact, the corresponding integration\nformula can be derived from this formula as corollary. We also give a classification\nscheme of the generalized random matrix ensembles, which will include all classical\nensembles and some new ensembles which were not considered before.\nMore precisely, Let \u03c3 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X be a smooth action of a Lie group G on\na Riemannian manifold X, preserving the induced Riemannian measure dx. Let\np(x) be a G-invariant smooth function on X, and consider the measure p(x)dx on\nX, which is not necessary a finite measure. We choose a closed submanifold Y\nof X consisting of representation points for almost all G-orbits in X. The Riemannian structure on X induces a Riemannian measure dy on Y . Let K be the\nclosed subgroup of G which fixes all points in Y , then the map \u03c3 reduces to a map\n\u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2192 X. Suppose there is a G-invariant measure d\u03bc on G/K, and\nsuppose dim(G/K \u00d7 Y ) = dim X, then it can be proved that the pull back measure\n\u03c6\u2217 (p(x)dx) of the measure p(x)dx is of the form \u03c6\u2217 (p(x)dx) = d\u03bcd\u03bd for some measure d\u03bd on Y , which is just the measure associated with the eigenvalue distribution.\nThe measure d\u03bd can be expressed as the form d\u03bd(y) = P(y)dy for some function\nP(y) on Y , which is just the joint density function. We write P(y) as the form\nP(y) = p(y)J(y), then under some orthogonality condition (that is Ty Y \u22a5 Ty Oy\nfor almost all y \u2208 Y ), we can compute the factor J(y) by the following formula\n(1.1)\n\nJ(y) = C| det \u03a8y |,\n\nwhere C is a constant, which can also be computed explicitly. This formula is the\nmain result of this paper, the density function P(y) and the eigenvalue distribution\nd\u03bd are determined by it. Here the map \u03a8y : l \u2192 Ty Oy is defined by\nd\n\u03c3exp t\u03be (y),\ndt t=0\nwhere l is a linear subspace of the Lie algebra g of G such that g = k \u2295 l, k is the\nLie algebra of K. We call the system (G, \u03c3, X, p(x)dx, Y, dy) a generalized random\nmatrix ensemble. The measure d\u03bd and the function P(y) on Y are called generalized\neigenvalue distribution and generalized joint density function, respectively. Using\nFormula (1.1), one can derive the joint density function for Gaussian ensemble,\nchiral ensemble, new transfer matrix ensembles, circular ensemble, Jacobi ensemble,\nand some other new generalized ensembles. The precise deriving process will be the\ncontent of a sequel paper [2]. Here we should point out that the proof of Formula\n(1.1) is not difficult, but this formula is very effective and available. The derivation\nof all concrete examples in [2], including all classical random matrix ensembles, will\nbe based on it.\n\u03a8y (\u03be) =\n\nOnce the eigenvalue distribution d\u03bd is derived by Formula (1.1), under a covering condition, we can get the associated integration formula. The Weyl integration\nformula for compact Lie groups, the Harish-Chandra's integration formula for complex semisimple Lie groups and real reductive groups, the integration formulae on\nRiemannian symmetric spaces of noncompact and compact types which were appeared in [9], as well as their Lie algebra versions are all of particular cases of it\n(see [2]).\n\n\f3\n\nNow let us give a sketch of each section of this paper. In \u00a72 we will develop\nsome geometrical preliminaries on the geometry of G-space which will be required\nto establish the generalized ensemble. After presenting four conditions, that is, the\ninvariance condition, the transversality condition, the dimension condition, and\nthe orthogonality condition, on which the definition of generalized ensemble will be\nbased, we will prove in Theorem 2.5 a primary form of Formula (1.1).\n\u00a73 will be devoted to the integration over G-spaces, which will be needed when\nwe derive the integration formula associated with the generalized random matrix\nensemble. Based on the four conditions presented in \u00a72 and a covering condition,\nwe will prove an integration formula in Theorem 3.3, which converts the integration\nover a G-space to the integration by first integrating over each G-orbit, and then\nintegrating over the orbits space. Two criterions on when the covering condition\nholds will also be given.\nPrepared by the preliminaries of \u00a72 and \u00a73, In \u00a74 we will give the precise definition\nof the generalized random matrix ensemble, as well as the associated generalized\neigenvalue distribution and generalized joint density function. In Theorem 4.1 the\nFormula (1.1) will be presented, from which the associated eigenvalue distribution\nmeasure and density function will be derived for various concrete examples of the\ngeneralized ensemble in an unified way in [2].\nIn \u00a75 we will give a classification scheme of generalized ensembles, that is, the\nlinear ensemble, the nonlinear noncompact ensemble, the compact ensemble, the\ngroup and algebra ensembles, as well as the pseudo-group and pseudo-algebra ensembles. According to this classification scheme, Gaussian ensemble and chiral ensemble are included in linear ensemble, new transfer matrix ensembles is included\nin nonlinear noncompact ensemble, circular and Jacobi ensembles are included in\ncompact ensemble. Some new ensembles which were not considered before will also\nbe included.\n2. Geometry of G-spaces\nIn this section we develop some geometrical preliminaries which will be needed\nto establish our theory of the generalized random matrix ensembles.\nFirst we make some preparation about measures on manifolds. Let M be an\nn-dimensional smooth manifold. A measure dx on M is called smooth (or quasismooth) if on any local coordinate chart (U ; x1 , * * * , xn ) of M , dx has the form\ndx = f (x)dx1 * * * dxn , where f is a smooth function on U and f > 0 (or f \u2265 0),\ndx1 * * * dxn is the Lebesgue measure on Rn . Note that the smooth measures on\nM are unique up to multiplying a positive smooth function on M , so the concept\nof set of measure zero makes sense, which is independent of the choice of smooth\nmeasure.\nLet M, N be two n-dimensional smooth manifolds, and let \u03c6 : M \u2192 N be a\nsmooth map. If dy is a smooth (or quasi-smooth) measure on N which can be\nexpressed locally as dy = f (y)dy1 * * * dyn , we can define the pull bake \u03c6\u2217 (dy) of dy\n\n\f4\n\nlocally as\n\n(2.1)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6 (dy) = f (\u03c6(x)) det\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202y\n\u2202x\n\n\u0013\n\ndx1 * * * dxn .\n\nIt is easily to check that the definition is compatible when we choose different\ncoordinate charts, and \u03c6\u2217 (dy) is a quasi-smooth measure on M . We can not expect\n\u03c6\u2217 (dy) is smooth in general, even if dy is smooth, since \u03c6 may have critical points.\nBut if \u03c6 is a local diffeomorphism and dy is smooth, then \u03c6\u2217 (dy) is smooth.\nIf M, N are Riemannian manifolds and dx, dy are the associated Riemannian\nmeasures, then we can express the pull back measure \u03c6\u2217 (dy) globally. To do this,\nfirst we need some comments on the \"determinant\" of a linear map between two\ndifferent inner product vector spaces of the same dimension. Suppose V, W are two\nn-dimensional vector spaces with inner products. For n vectors\np v1 , * * * , vn \u2208 V , let\naij = hvi , vj i for 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, and define V ol(v1 , * * * , vn ) = det(aij ). Note that\nif v1 , * * * , vn is an orthogonal basis, then V ol(v1 , * * * , vn ) = |v1 | * * * |vn |. For vectors\nin W we define the same things. Suppose A : V \u2192 W is a linear map, define\n\n(2.2)\n\n| det A| =\n\nV ol(Av1 , * * * , Avn )\n,\nV ol(v1 , * * * , vn )\n\nwhere v1 , * * * , vn is a basis of V . It is easily to check that the definition is independent of the choice of the basis v1 , * * * , vn . In the special case that v1 , * * * , vn is an\northogonal basis of V and Av1 , * * * , Avn are mutually orthogonal, then\n\n(2.3)\n\n| det A| =\n\n|Av1 | * * * |Avn |\n.\n|v1 | * * * |vn |\n\nNote that we can only expect the norm of the determinant | det A| is well defined,\nsince the sign \"\u00b1\" depends on the choice of orientations of V and W .\nProposition 2.1. Suppose M, N are two n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds\nwith the associated Riemannian measures dx, dy, repsectively. If \u03c6 : M \u2192 N is a\nsmooth map, then\n(2.4)\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (dy) = | det(d\u03c6)x |dx.\n\nProof.

Let G be a Lie group, which acts on an n-dimensional smooth manifold X. The action is denoted by \u03c3 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X, and we denote \u03c3g (x) = \u03c3(g, x).\nOur first goal is, roughly speaking, to choose a representation point in each G-orbit\nOx = {\u03c3g (x) : g \u2208 G}, and the representation points should depend smoothly on\nthe orbits. But in general this aim can only be achieved partially. So suppose we\nhave a closed submanifold Y of X, which consists of the representation points of\nthe orbits in one's mind, such that Y intersects \"almost all\" orbits transversally.\nMore precisely, we suppose there are closed zero measure subsets Xz \u2282 X, Yz \u2282 Y .\nLet X \u2032 = X \\ Xz , Y \u2032 = Y \\ Yz , and suppose that\n[\n(a) (invariance condition) X \u2032 =\nOy .\ny\u2208Y \u2032\n\n(b)\n\n(transversality condition)\n\nTy X = Ty Oy \u2295 Ty Y ,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\nIt is clear that (a) implies Y \u2032 = Y \u2229 X \u2032 , and then Yz = Y \u2229 Xz . Notice that X \u2032\nand Y \u2032 are open and dense submanifolds of X and Y , respectively. So \u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 ,\nTy X \u2032 = Ty X, Ty Y \u2032 = Ty Y .\nLet K = {g \u2208 G : \u03c3g (y) = y, \u2200y \u2208 Y }, then K is a closed subgroup of G.\nFor g \u2208 G, we denote [g] = gK in G/K. The map \u03c3 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X reduces\nto a map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2192 X by \u03c6([g], y) = \u03c3g (y), and then induces a map\n\n\f6\n\nG/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 by restriction, which we also denote by \u03c6. By the assumption\nabove, \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is surjective. For x \u2208 X, Let Gx = {g \u2208 G : \u03c3g (x) = x}\nbe the isotropic subgroup associated with x. Then K \u2282 Gy , \u2200y \u2208 Y . Let dx, dy be\nsmooth measures on X and Y , respectively. We suppose dx is G-invariant. In the\nfollowing we suppose that\n(c)\n\n(dimension condition)\n\ndimGy = dimK,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\nThis means that \u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 , Gy and K have the same Lie algebras, and the only\ndifference between Gy and K is that Gy may have more components than K. Then\nfor some y \u2208 Y \u2032 , we have\ndimX =dimTy X\n=dimTy Y + dimTy Oy\n=dimY + dimG \u2212 dimGy\n=dimY + dimG \u2212 dimK.\nSo \u03c6 is a map between manifolds of the same dimension, and the pull back \u03c6\u2217 (dx)\nof dx makes sense. Suppose also that there is a G-invariant smooth measure d\u03bc on\nG/K, then the product measure d\u03bcdy on G/K \u00d7 Y is smooth, so\n(2.5)\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (dx) = J([g], y)d\u03bcdy\n\nfor some J \u2208 C \u221e (G/K \u00d7 Y ) with J \u2265 0.\nRemark 2.1. The G-invariant smooth measure d\u03bc on G/K exists if and only if\n\u2206G |K = \u2206K , where \u2206G and \u2206K are the modular functions on G and K, respectively, see, e.g., Knapp [11], Section 8.3. For concrete examples in the following\nsections, this condition always hold.\nProposition 2.2. The smooth function J \u2208 C \u221e (G/K \u00d7 Y ) is independent of the\nfirst variable [g] \u2208 G/K. So we can rewrite formula (2.5) as\n\u03c6\u2217 (dx) = J(y)d\u03bcdy\n\n(2.6)\nwhere J \u2208 C \u221e (Y ) with J \u2265 0.\n\nProof. We denote the natural action of h \u2208 G on G/K also by lh , then one can\neasily verify that \u03c3h \u25e6 \u03c6 = \u03c6 \u25e6 (lh \u00d7 id). By the G-invariance of dx and d\u03bc, we have\nJ([g], y)d\u03bcdy\n=\u03c6\u2217 (dx)\n=\u03c6\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c3h\u2217 (dx)\n=(lh \u00d7 id)\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c6\u2217 (dx)\n=(lh \u00d7 id)\u2217 (J([g], y)d\u03bcdy)\n=J(h[g], y)(lh\u2217 (d\u03bc) \u00d7 id\u2217 (dy))\n=J([hg], y)d\u03bcdy.\nSo J([g], y) = J([hg], y) for all g, h \u2208 G, which means J is independent of the first\nvariable.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.3. There exists a quasi-smooth measure d\u03bd on Y such that\n(2.7)\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (dx) = d\u03bcd\u03bd.\n\n\f7\n\nThe measure d\u03bd is given by\n(2.8)\n\nd\u03bd(y) = J(y)dy.\n\n\u0003\nThe factor J(y) can also be given by more general smooth measures u(x)dx and\nv(y)dy on X and Y . A direct calculation yields the following\nProposition 2.4. Suppose conditions (a), (b), and (c) hold. If the measures vary\nby dx\u2032 = u(x)dx, dy \u2032 = v(y)dy, and d\u03bc\u2032 = \u03bbd\u03bc, where u, v are positive smooth\nfunctions on X, Y , respectively, u is G-invariant, and \u03bb is a positive constant, then\nJ(y) varies by\nu(y)\nJ(y).\nJ \u2032 (y) =\n\u03bbv(y)\n\u0003\nNow we suppose that there is a Riemannian structure on X such that dx and dy\nare the induced Riemannian measures on X and Y , respectively. We suppose the\nfollowing orthogonality condition holds\n(d)\n\nTy Y \u22a5 Ty Oy ,\n\n(orthogonality condition)\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\nThen we can compute the factor J(y) in a simple way by the following theorem.\nLet l be a linear subspace of the Lie algebra g of G such that g = k \u2295 l, where\nk is the Lie algebra of K. Let \u03c0 : G \u2192 G/K be the natural projection, then\n(d\u03c0)e |l : l \u2192 T[e] (G/K) is an isomorphism. We endow a Riemannian structure on\nG/K such that the associated Riemannian measure is d\u03bc, then it also induces an\ninner product on T[e] (G/K). For y \u2208 Y , we define a linear map \u03a8y : l \u2192 Ty Oy by\n(2.9)\n\n\u03a8y (\u03be) =\n\nd\ndt\n\nt=0\n\n\u03c3exp t\u03be (y),\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 l.\n\nIf y \u2208 Y \u2032 , then dim l = dim Ty Oy . We choose an inner product on l, and endow the\ninner product on Ty Oy induced from the Riamannian structure on X. Then the\n\"determinants\" | det \u03a8y | and | det((d\u03c0)e |l )| make sense.\nTheorem 2.5. Under the above assumptions, we have\n(2.10)\n\nJ(y) = C| det \u03a8y |,\n\nfor y \u2208 Y \u2032 , where C = | det((d\u03c0)e |l )|\u22121 is a constant.\nProof. By the transversality condition (b), the tangent map\n(d\u03c6)([e],y) : T([e],y) (G/K \u00d7 Y ) \u2192 Ty X\nof \u03c6 at the point ([e], y) (y \u2208 Y \u2032 ) can be regarded as\n(d\u03c6)([e],y) : T[e] (G/K) \u2295 Ty Y \u2192 Ty Oy \u2295 Ty Y.\ne y = (d\u03c6)([e],y) |T (G/K) : T[e] (G/K) \u2192 Ty Oy , then it is obvious that\nDenote \u03a8\n[e]\ne\n\u03a8y = \u03a8y \u25e6 (d\u03c0)e |l , and one can easily show that in the matrix form,\n\u0012\n\u0013\ney 0\n\u03a8\n(d\u03c6)([e],y) =\n.\n0 id\n\n\f8\n\nSince d\u03bc is the associated Riemannian measure on G/K, the product measure\nd\u03bcdy is the the associated Riemannian measure on the product Riemannian manifold G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 . By Proposition 2.1 and the orthogonality condition (d),\nJ(y) = det(d\u03c6)([e],y)\n\u0012\n\u0013\ney 0\n\u03a8\n= det\n0 id\ne\n=| det \u03a8y |\n\n=| det(\u03a8y \u25e6 ((d\u03c0)e |l )\u22121 )|\n=C| det \u03a8y |,\n\nwhere C = | det((d\u03c0)e |l )|\u22121 . This proves the theorem.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 2.2. Although formula (2.10) only hold on Y \u2032 , since Y \u2032 is dense in Y and\nJ \u2208 C \u221e (Y ), we can get J(y) for all y \u2208 Y by smooth continuation.\n3. Integrations over G-spaces\nOccasionally we will be interested in some kinds of integration formulae. In\nthis section we give some preliminaries on integrations. The reader who has more\ninterest in the eigenvalue distributions of the generalized random matrix ensembles\nmay skip this section and go to \u00a74 directly.\nThe following proposition generalizes the change of variables formula for multiple\nintegration.\nProposition 3.1. Let \u03c6 : M \u2192 N be a smooth map between two n-dimensional\nsmooth manifolds M and N , dy a smooth measure on N . If \u03c6 is a local diffeomorphism and is a d-sheeted covering map, then for any f \u2208 C \u221e (N ) with f \u2265 0 or\nwith f \u2208 L1 (N, dy), we have\nZ\nZ\n1\n(3.1)\nf (y)dy =\nf (\u03c6(x))\u03c6\u2217 (dy).\nd\nN\nM\n\nProof. It is a standard argument using partition of unity, the details is omitted\nhere.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.1. Formula (3.1) seems like a formula which relates degree of a map and\nintegration of volume forms on manifold. When M, N are compact and oriented,\nthen under the conditions of Proposition 3.1, up to a \"\u00b1\" sign, formula (3.1) says\nnothing but of this. But, in general, the integration of differential forms is not\nsuitable for us. What we will need is a change of variables formula which should\nignore the negative sign.\nAs in the previous section, Let X be a G-space, where X is an n-dimensional\nsmooth manifold, G is a Lie group. Then we have the reduced map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2192\nX. Suppose dx, dy, and d\u03bc are smooth measures on X, Y , and G/K, respectively,\nwith dx and d\u03bc to be G-invariant. Our goal is to convert the integration over X\nto the integration over Y . Suppose the conditions (a), (b), and (c) hold. We hope\nthe map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 satisfies the conditions as given in Proposition 3.1.\n\n\f9\n\nProposition 3.2. Suppose conditions (a), (b) and (c) hold. Then \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192\nX \u2032 is a local diffeomorphism.\nProof. Let e be the unit element in G. For ([e], y) \u2208 G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 , d\u03c6([e],y) (0, v) =\nv, \u2200v \u2208 Ty Y \u2032 , so Ty Y \u2032 \u2282 Im(d\u03c6([e],y) ). Furthermore, \u03c6|G/K\u00d7{y} : G/K \u00d7 {y} \u2192\nOy \u223c\n= G/Gy is a local diffeomorphism, so Ty Oy \u2282 Im(d\u03c6([e],y) ). Thus d\u03c6([e],y) is\nsurjective. But dim(G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 ) = dimX \u2032 , so d\u03c6([e],y) is in fact an isomorphism.\nFor general ([g], y) \u2208 G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 , notice that \u03c6 \u25e6 lg = \u03c3g \u25e6 \u03c6, where lg ([h], y) =\n([gh], y), so d\u03c6([g],y) \u25e6 (dlg )([e],y) = (d\u03c3g )([e],y) \u25e6 d\u03c6([e],y) , and d\u03c6([e],y) is isomorphic\nimplies d\u03c6([g],y) is isomorphic. Thus \u03c6 is everywhere regular, and hence is a local\ndiffeomorphism.\n\u0003\nTo make Proposition 3.1 available, we endow the following covering condition.\n(e) (covering condition)\nmap, with d < +\u221e.\n\nThe map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is a d-sheeted covering\n\nTheorem 3.3. Suppose conditions (a), (b), (c), and (e) hold. Then we have\n!\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\nf (x)dx =\n(3.2)\nf (\u03c3g (y))d\u03bc([g]) J(y)dy\nd Y\nX\nG/K\nfor all f \u2208 C \u221e (X) with f \u2265 0 or with f \u2208 L1 (X, dx), where J \u2208 C \u221e (Y ) is\ndetermined by Formula (2.6).\nProof. By Proposition 3.2, \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is a local diffeomorphism. By the\ncovering condition (e), \u03c6 is a d-sheeted covering map. So by Proposition 3.1, for\nf \u2208 C \u221e (X) with f \u2265 0 or f \u2208 L1 (X, dx), we have\nZ\nZ\nf (x)dx\nf (x)dx =\nX\u2032\nX\nZ\n1\nf (\u03c6([g], y))\u03c6\u2217 (dx)\n=\nd G/K\u00d7Y \u2032\nZ\n1\n=\nf (\u03c3g (y))J(y)d\u03bc([g])dy\nd G/K\u00d7Y \u2032\n!\nZ\nZ\n1\nf (\u03c3g (y))d\u03bc([g]) J(y)dy\n=\nd Y\u2032\nG/K\n!\nZ\nZ\n1\n=\nf (\u03c3g (y))d\u03bc([g]) J(y)dy\nd Y\nG/K\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.4. Under the same conditions as in the above Theorem, if furthermore\nf (\u03c3g (x)) = f (x), \u2200g \u2208 G, x \u2208 X, then\nZ\nZ\n\u03bc(G/K)\nf (y)J(y)dy.\nf (x)dx =\n(3.3)\nd\nY\nX\n\n\f10\n\n\u0003\nTo make the above conclusion more available, we give some criterions on when\nthe map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is a covering map.\nProposition 3.5. Let M, N be smooth n-dimensional manifolds. Then an everywhere regular smooth map \u03c6 : M \u2192 N is a d-sheeted covering map if and only if\nfor each y \u2208 N , \u03c6\u22121 (y) has d points.\nProof.\n\nThe \"\u21d2\" part is obvious. We prove the \"\u21d0\" part.\n\nFor y \u2208 N , let \u03c6\u22121 (y) = {x1 , * * * , xd }. Since \u03c6 is everywhere regular, there\nexists open neighborhood Ui of xi , i = 1, * * * , d, such that Ui \u2229 Uj = \u2205 for i 6= j,\nTd\nand \u03c6i = \u03c6|Ui : Ui \u2192 \u03c6(Ui ) is a diffeomorphism. Let V = i=1 \u03c6(Ui ), and\nlet Vi = \u03c6\u22121\ni (V ), then \u03c6|Vi is also a diffeomorphism onto V . We conclude that\nS\nd\n\u03c6\u22121 (V ) = i=1 Vi . In fact, \u2200z \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (V ), let zi = \u03c6i\u22121 (\u03c6(z)), then zi \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (\u03c6(z))\nand zi 6= zj for i 6= j. But z \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (\u03c6(z)) and |\u03c6\u22121 (\u03c6(z))| = d, this force z = zi0\nSd\nSd\nfor some i0 . Hence z \u2208 i=1 Vi . Therefore \u03c6\u22121 (V ) = i=1 Vi . The Lemma is\nproved.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.6. Suppose conditions (a), (b) and (c) hold. If furthermore \u2203d \u2208 N\nsuch that \u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 ,\n(1)\n\nthe isotropic subgroup Gy = K,\n\n(2)\n\n|Oy \u2229 Y \u2032 | = d,\n\nthen \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is a d-sheeted covering map.\nProof. By Proposition 3.2, \u03c6 is a local diffeomorphism. So by the above Proposition, we need only to show that for each x \u2208 X \u2032 , \u03c6\u22121 (x) has d points.\nFor x \u2208 Y \u2032 , suppose Ox \u2229 Y \u2032 = {y1 , * * * , yd }. Then there exists gi \u2208 G such that\n\u03c3gi (yi ) = x for each i \u2208 {1, * * * , d}. Then ([gi ], yi ) \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (x). On the other hand, if\n([g], y) \u2208 \u03c6\u22121 (x), then y = yi0 for some i0 \u2208 {1, * * * , d}. Now we have \u03c3gg\u22121 (x) =\ni0\n\n\u03c3g (yi0 ) = x, that is ggi\u22121\n\u2208 Gx = K, so [g] = [gi0 ] and ([g], y) = ([gi0 ], yi0 ). Thus\n0\n\u03c6\u22121 (x) = {([g1 ], y1 ), * * * , ([gd ], yd )}.\nIn general for x \u2208 X \u2032 , suppose \u03c3h (x) \u2208 Y \u2032 for some h \u2208 G, then the relation\n\u03c6 (\u03c3h (x)) = lh (\u03c6\u22121 (x)) reduces the general case to the above one.\n\u0003\n\u22121\n\nBoth Proposition 3.5 and Corollary 3.6 will be used in the following sections\nwhen we consider concrete examples.\nRemark 3.2. The converse of Corollary 3.6 is not true. That is, the isotropic\nsubgroups Gy associated with y \u2208 Y \u2032 may vary \"suddenly\", even if Y \u2032 is connected.\nFor example, The group SO(n) acts on RP n smoothly if we regard RP n as the\nquotient space by gluing the opposite points on the boundary of the closed unit ball\nB n . Let Xz be the image of {0}, Y be the image of the segment {(x, 0, * * * , 0) : |x| \u2264\n1}, then the conditions (a), (b), (c), and (e) hold. The isotropic subgroup associated\nwith the image of a point in Y \u2032 which is an interior point of B n is diag(1, SO(n\u22121)),\n\n\f11\n\nbut for the image of the point (1, 0, * * * , 0), its isotropic subgroup is diag(\u00b11, O\u00b1 (n\u2212\n1)) (here O\u00b1 (n \u2212 1) = {g \u2208 O(n \u2212 1) : det g = \u00b11} ). Other examples with\nthe similar phenomena will appeared in [2] when we consider the group ensemble\nassociated with complex semisimple Lie groups. When the phenomena of sudden\nvariation of the isotropic subgroups happens, whether we can in general make them\nto be of the same by enlarging the set Xz is an open problem.\n4. Generalized random matrix ensembles\nNow we are prepared to establish the generalized random matrix ensembles.\nLet G be a Lie group which acts on an n-dimensional smooth manifold X by\n\u03c3 : G \u00d7 X \u2192 X. For the convenience, we suppose X is a Riemannian manifold.\nSuppose the induced Riemannian measure dx is G-invariant (note that we do not\nrequire the Riemannian structure on X to be G-invarinant). Let Y be a closed\nsubmanifold of X which is endowed the induced Riemannian measure dy, and let\nK = {g \u2208 G : \u03c3g (y) = y, \u2200y \u2208 Y }. As in \u00a72, we form the map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2192 X\nby \u03c6([g], y) = \u03c3g (y). Let Xz \u2282 X, Yz \u2282 Y be closed zero measure subsets of X and\nY , respectively. Denote X \u2032 = X \\ Xz , Y \u2032 = Y \\ Yz . We suppose the conditions (a),\n(b), (c), and (d) of \u00a72 hold. For the reader's convenience, we list them below.\n[\n(a) (invariance condition) X \u2032 =\nOy .\ny\u2208Y \u2032\n\n(b)\n\n(transversality condition)\n\n(c)\n\n(dimension condition)\n\n(d)\n\n(orthogonality condition)\n\nTy X = Ty Oy \u2295 Ty Y ,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\ndimGy = dimK,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\nTy Y \u22a5 Ty Oy ,\n\n\u2200y \u2208 Y \u2032 .\n\nSuppose d\u03bc is a G-invariant smooth measure on G/K, and suppose p(x) is a Ginvariant smooth function on X. Then by Corollary 2.3, there is a quasi-smooth\nmeasure d\u03bd on Y such that\n(4.1)\n\n\u03c6\u2217 (p(x)dx) = d\u03bcd\u03bd.\n\nDefinition 4.1. Let the conditions and notations be as above. Then the system\n(G, \u03c3, X, p(x)dx, Y, dy) is called a generalized random matrix ensemble. The manifolds X and Y are called the integration manifold and the eigenvalue manifold,\nrespectively. The measure d\u03bd on Y determined by (4.1) is called the generalized\neigenvalue distribution.\nRecall that in \u00a72 we have defined the map \u03a8y : l \u2192 Ty Oy by\n\u03a8y (\u03be) =\n\nd\ndt\n\nt=0\n\n\u03c3exp t\u03be (y),\n\n\u2200\u03be \u2208 l,\n\nwhere l is a linear subspace of g such that g = k \u2295 l. Thanks to the preliminaries\nin \u00a72, we can compute the generalized eigenvalue distribution directly according to\nthe following theorem.\n\n\f12\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let (G, \u03c3, X, p(x)dx, Y, dy) be a generalized random matrix ensemble. Then the generalized eigenvalue distribution d\u03bd is given by\nd\u03bd(y) = P(y)dy = p(y)J(y)dy,\n\n(4.2)\nwhere\n\nJ(y) = C| det \u03a8y |,\n\n(4.3)\nhere C = | det((d\u03c0)e |l )|\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\nProof. This follows directly from Proposition 2.2, Corollary 2.3, Proposition 2.4\nand Theorem 2.5.\n\u0003\nThe function P(y) = p(y)J(y) determined by formula (4.2) is called the generalized joint density function.\nOne of the most fundamental problems in the random matrix theory is to compute the eigenvalue distribution d\u03bd. In our generalized scheme, it is given by formulae (4.2) and (4.3). Note that the power of (4.3) is reflected by the fact that\nit provides a direct and unified method to compute the eigenvalue distributions of\nvarious kinds of random matrix ensembles. In the sequel paper [2], we will see that\nall the classical ensembles are included in the generalized scheme, and the corresponding eigenvalue distributions can be derived from (4.2) and (4.3). We will also\npresent various kinds of generalized ensemble which were not considered before,\nand compute their eigenvalue distributions explicitly.\nNow we consider the integration formula associated with the generalized random\nmatrix ensemble. As in \u00a73, we assume the following covering condition holds.\n(e) (covering condition)\nmap, with d < +\u221e.\n\nThe map \u03c6 : G/K \u00d7 Y \u2032 \u2192 X \u2032 is a d-sheeted covering\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let (G, \u03c3, X, p(x)dx, Y, dy) be a generalized random matrix ensemble. Suppose the covering condition (e) holds. Then we have the following integration formula\n!\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\nf (\u03c3g (y))d\u03bc([g]) d\u03bd(y)\nf (x)p(x)dx =\n(4.4)\nd Y\nG/K\nX\nfor all f \u2208 C \u221e (X) with f \u2265 0 or with f \u2208 L1 (X, p(x)dx). If moreover f (\u03c3g (x)) =\nf (x), \u2200g \u2208 G, x \u2208 X, then\nZ\nZ\n\u03bc(G/K)\n(4.5)\nf (x)p(x)dx =\nf (y)d\u03bd(y).\nd\nX\nY\n\nProof. It is obvious by Theorem 3.3 and Corollary 3.4.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn formula (4.5), if the measure p(x)dx is a probability measure, and we let\nR\nf = 1, we get \u03bc(G/K)\nd\nY d\u03bd(y) = 1. So if G/K is compact, we can normalized the\nmeasure d\u03bc such that \u03bc(G/K) = d, then the generalized eigenvalue distribution d\u03bd\nis a probability measure.\nRemark 4.1. The condition f \u2208 C \u221e (X) in Theorem 4.2 is superfluous. In fact, it\nis sufficient to assume f is measurable. The same is true for Proposition 3.1 and\nTheorem 3.3.\n\n\f13\n\n5. A classification scheme of generalized ensembles\nIn this section we give a classification scheme of the generalized random matrix\nensembles, that is,\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nLinear ensemble,\nNonlinear noncompact ensemble,\nCompact ensemble,\nGroup ensemble,\nAlgebra ensembles,\nPseudo-group ensemble,\nPseudo-algebra ensemble.\n\nFirst we define the linear ensemble and the nonlinear noncompact ensemble.\nLet G be a real reductive Lie group with Lie algebra g in the sense of Knapp\n[11], Section 7.2. Then G admits a global Cartan involution \u0398, which induces\na Cartan involution \u03b8 of g. Let the corresponding Cartan decomposition of g is\ng = k \u2295 p. Let K = {g \u2208 G : \u0398(g) = g}, P = exp(p), then K is a maximal\ncompact subgroup of G with Lie algebra k, P is a closed submanifold of G satisfies\nTe P = p. The spaces p and P are invariant under the adjoint action A = Ad|K and\nthe conjugate action \u03c3 of K, respectively. Let a be a maximal abelian subspace\nof p, and let A be the connected subgroup of G with Lie algebra a. Let M =\n{k \u2208 K : Ak (\u03b7) = \u03b7, \u2200\u03b7 \u2208 a} = {k \u2208 K : \u03c3k (a) = a, \u2200a \u2208 A}. It can be shown\nthat there are Riemannian structures on p and P inducing K-invariant Riemannian\nmeasures dX on p and dx on P . They also induce Riemannian measures dY on a\nand da on A. There is also a K-invariant smooth measure d\u03bc on K/M . Let p1 (\u03be)\nand p2 (x) be K-invariant positive smooth functions on p and P , then it can be\nproved that the systems (K, A, p, p1 (\u03be)dX(\u03be), a, dY ) and (K, \u03c3, P, p2 (x)dx, A, da)\nare generalized random matrix ensembles, which we called linear ensemble and\nnonlinear noncompact ensemble, respectively. It can be shown that the Gaussian\nensemble and the chiral ensemble are particular examples of linear ensemble, and\nthe new transfer matrix ensembles are particular examples of nonlinear noncompact\nensemble.\nNext we define the compact ensemble. Let G be a connected compact Lie group\nG with Lie algebra g. Suppose \u0398 is a global involutive of G with the induced\ninvolution \u03b8 = d\u0398 of g. Let K = {g \u2208 G : \u0398(g) = g}, and let p be the eigenspace\nof \u03b8 corresponding the eigenvalue \u22121. Let P = exp(p), then P is invariant under\nthe conjugate action \u03c3 of K. It was proved in [1] that P is a closed submanifold\nof G satisfies Te P = p, which is just the identity component of the set {g \u2208 G :\n\u0398(g) = g \u22121 }. Let a be a maximal abelian subspace of p, and let A be the torus\nwith Lie algebra a. There is a Riemannian structure on P induces a K-invariant\nRiemannian measure dx on P and a Riemannian measure da on A. Let M = {k \u2208\nK : \u03c3k (a) = a, \u2200a \u2208 A}, then there is a K-invariant smooth measure d\u03bc on K/M .\nLet p(x) be a K-invariant positive smooth function on P , then it can be proved\nthat the system (K, \u03c3, P, p(x)dx, A, da) is a generalized random matrix ensemble,\nwhich we call it compact ensemble. It can be shown that the circular ensemble and\nthe Jacobi ensembles are particular examples of compact ensemble.\n\n\f14\n\nLet G be an unimodular Lie group G with Lie algebra g. Then there are Riemannian structures on G and g inducing a \u03c3-invariant Riemannian measure dg on\nG and an Ad-invariant Riemannian measure dX on g, where \u03c3 denotes the conjugate action of G on itself. Let p1 (g) and p2 (\u03be) be two function on G and g,\nrespectively, which are invariant under the corresponding actions of G. If there\nexists a closed submanifold Y of G such that (G, \u03c3, G, p(g)dg, Y, dy) is a generalized\nrandom matrix ensemble, where dy is the induced Riemannian measure on Y , then\nwe call it a group ensemble. And if there exists a closed submanifold y of g such\nthat (G, Ad, g, p(\u03be)dX(\u03be), y, dY ) is a generalized random matrix ensemble, where\ndY is the induced Riemannian measure on y, then we call it an algebra ensemble.\nAmong all the unimodular Lie groups, the connected compact Lie group and the\nconnected complex semisimple Lie group are of particular interest. For a connected\ncompact Lie group G, we can let the submanifold Y of G be a maximal torus T of\nG, and let the submanifold y of g be the Lie algebra of T . For a connected complex\nsemisimple Lie group G, we can let the submanifold y of g be a Cartan subalgebra\nof g, and let the submanifold Y of G be the corresponding Cartan subgroup of\nG. For these cases, it can be proved that the systems (G, \u03c3, G, p(g)dg, Y, dy) and\n(G, Ad, g, p(\u03be)dX(\u03be), y, dY ) are generalized random matrix ensembles.\nNow we define the pseudo-group ensemble and the pseudo-algebra ensembles,\nwhich are related to real reductive groups. Let G be a real reductive group with lie\nalgebra g. Let \u03b8 be a Cartan involution of g, and let h1 , * * * , hm be a maximal set\nof mutually nonconjugate \u03b8 stable Cartan subalgebras of g with the corresponding\nCartan subgroups H1 , * * * , Hm of G. Denote the sets of all regular elements in\nG and g by Gr and gr . Let Hj\u2032 = Hj \u2229 Gr , h\u2032j = hj \u2229 gr . Then it is known\nF\nF\nS\nS\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthat Gr = m\ngr = m\nj=1\ng\u2208G \u03c3g (Hj ) (see [11], Theorem 7.108),\nj=1\ng\u2208G Adg (hj )\nF\n(see\n1.3.4.1), here the symbol\ndisjoint union. Each\nS [14], Proposition\nS \" \" means\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c3\n(H\n)\nis\nan\nopen\nset\nin\nG,\nand\neach\nAd\n(h\n)\ng j is an open set in g.\ng\u2208G g\ng\u2208G\nSj\nS\n\u2032\n\u2032\nLet Gj = g\u2208G \u03c3g (Hj ), gj = g\u2208G Adg (hj ). It can be shown that some suitable\nRiemannian structures on G and g induce a \u03c3-invariant measure dgj on Gj and\nan Ad-invariant measure dXj on gj for each j, and they also induce a Riemannian\nmeasure dhj on Hj and a Riemannian measure dYj on hj . It is known that Z(Hj ) =\n{g \u2208 G : \u03c3g (h) = h, \u2200h \u2208 Hj }, Hj = {g \u2208 G : Adg (\u03be) = \u03be, \u2200\u03be \u2208 hj }. Let d\u03bc\u2032j , d\u03bcj\nbe G-invariant measures on G/Z(Hj ) and G/Hj , respectively. In general, the\nspaces Gj and gj may have singularities. But this doesn't matter, since they are\nclosures of open submanifolds in G and g, whose boundaries have measure zero.\nIf we ignore this ambiguity, then it can be proved that (G, \u03c3, Gj , dgj , Hj , dhj ) and\n(G, Ad, gj , dXj , hj , dYj ) are generalized random matrix ensembles, which we called\npseudo-group ensemble and pseudo-algebra ensemble, respectively.\nDue to the generality of the definition, our classification could not exhaust all\nkinds of generalized ensemble. But it would include all kinds of classical random\nmatrix ensembles and some new examples of generalized ensembles, which will be\nanalyzed explicitly in the sequel paper [2].\n\n\f15\n\nReferences\n[1] An, J., Wang, Z., On the realization of Riemannian symmetric spaces in Lie groups, preprint,\nmath.GT/0502028.\n[2] An, J., Wang, Z., Yan, K., A Generalization of random matrix ensemble II: concrete examples\nand integration formulae, preprint.\n[3] Altland, A., Zirnbauer, M.
