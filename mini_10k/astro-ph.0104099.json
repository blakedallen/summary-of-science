In the case of M71 it is found that the\nobserved CN and CH band strengths are best matched by the identical C/N/O abundances which fit the bright giants, implying: 1) little if any mixing is taking place during\nred giant branch ascent in M71, and 2) a substantial component of the C and N abundance inhomogeneities is in place before the main sequence turn-off. The unlikelihood\nof mixing while on the main sequence requires an explanation for the abundance variations which lies outside the present stars (primordial inhomogeneities or intra-cluster\nself enrichment). For M13 it is shown that the 3883\u00c5 CN bands are too weak to be\nmeasured in the spectra for any reasonable set of expected compositions. A similar\nsituation exists for CH as well. However, two of the more luminous program stars do\nappear to have C abundances considerably greater than those found among the bright\ngiants thereby suggesting deep mixing has taken place on the M13 red giant branch.\nSubject headings: globular clusters: general - globular clusters: individual (M71, M13)\n- stars: evolution - stars: abundances\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBy virtue of their large populations of coeval stars, the Galactic globular clusters present us\nwith a unique laboratory for the study of the evolution of low mass stars. The combination of their\nextreme ages, compositions and dynamics also allows us a glimpse at the early history of the Milky\nWay and the processes operating during its formation. These aspects become even more significant\nin the context of the star-to-star light element inhomogeneities found among red giants in every\ncluster studied to date. The large differences in the surface abundances of C, N, O, and often Na,\nMg, and Al have defied a comprehensive explanation in the three decades since their discovery.\n1\n\nBased partially on observations obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the California Institute of Technology and the University of California\n2\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, Oshkosh, Wisconsin\n\n3\n\nPalomar Observatory, Mail Stop 105-24, California Institute of Technology\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nProposed origins of the inhomogeneities typically break down into two scenarios: 1) As C, N,\nO, Na, Mg, and Al are related to proton capture processes at CN and CNO-burning temperatures,\nmaterial cycled through a region above the H-burning shell in evolving cluster giants may be\nbrought to the surface with accompanying changes in composition. While standard models of low\nmass stars do not predict this \"deep mixing\", several theoretical mechanisms have been proposed\n(e.g., the meridional mixing of Sweigart & Mengel 1979, and turbulent diffusion, Charbonel 1994,\n1995) with varying degrees of success. Moreover, there is ample observational evidence that deep\nmixing does take place during the red giant branch (RGB) ascent of metal-poor cluster stars\n(the works here are far too numerous to list - see the reviews of Kraft 1994 and Pinsonneault\n1997 and references therein). 2) It has also become apparent that at least some component of\nthese abundance variations must be in place before some cluster stars reach the giant branch.\nSpectroscopic observations of main sequence turn-off stars in 47 Tuc (Hesser 1978; Hesser & Bell\n1980; Bell, Hesser, & Cannon 1983; Briley, Hesser, & Bell 1991; Briley et al.1994, 1996; Cannon et\nal. 1998) and NGC 6752 (Suntzeff & Smith 1991) have shown variations in CN and CH-band and\nNa line strengths consistent with patterns found among the evolved giants of these clusters. The\nassumption that these low mass cluster stars are incapable of both deep dredge-up and significant\nCNO nucleosynthesis while on the main sequence leads to the possibility that the early cluster\nmaterial was at least partially inhomogeneous in these elements or that some form of modification\nof these elements has taken place within the cluster. Suggested culprits include mass-loss from\nintermediate mass asymptotic giant branch stars, novae, and supernovae ejecta (see Smith & Kraft\n1996, and Cannon et al. 1998 for an excellent discussion of these possibilities).\nThus the observed light element inhomogeneities imply that there is some aspect of the structure of the evolving cluster giants which remains poorly understood (the deep mixing mechanism),\nthat the early proto-clusters may have been far less homogeneous, that intermediate mass stars may\nhave played a greater role in setting the composition of the present day low mass stars than previously thought, etc. Indeed, the evidence sited in the reviews above have lead many investigators\nto suggest that a combination of processes are responsible, i.e., many clusters contain star-to-star\ninhomogeneities established early in their histories which have been further altered by deep mixing\nduring RGB ascent. This of course greatly exacerbates the problem as a knowledge of the composition of the more easily observed bright red giants will not tell the whole story of their chemical\nhistory - one must also understand the makeup of the main sequence stars.\nCohen (1999a,b) measured CH and CN indices for a large sample of main sequence stars in each\nof M71 and M13. In the case of M71, clear variations of both indices were seen at a fixed luminosity\namong the main sequence stars which are significantly larger than the observational uncertainties.\nCohen found that these indices are each to first order bimodal and they are anti-correlated. There\nare approximately equal numbers of CN weak/CH strong and CN strong/CH weak main sequence\nstars in M71. At least qualitatively, these patterns are very similar to those observed among the\nbright M71 red giants. In the case of M13, which is metal poor compared to M71 by a factor of \u223c 4,\nthe observed indices are much weaker, and variability from star to star was not clearly detected in\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\neither the CH or the CN index.\nThe purpose of the present paper is to determine the range of C and N abundances which\nwill reproduce the behavior observed in the M71 main sequence stars and to compare this with\nthe range in abundances found on the giant branch of M71 by Briley, Smith & Claver (2001). For\nM13, we examine the detectability of star-to-star variations in the observed CH and CN indices for\nthe sample of main sequence stars of Cohen if the behavior of C, N and O is similar to that found\namong its giants and attempt to constrain the allowed range of C, N, and O abundances.\nThe approach adopted here is to represent the sample of globular cluster main sequence stars\nby a series of model atmospheres taken from isochrones appropriate for M13 and for M71 across\nthe relevant luminosity range. We demonstrate the validity of the models by comparing colors\ngenerated using them to the observed color magnitude diagrams (CMDs). These models are then\nused to generate synthetic spectra from which CH and CN indices are measured. The model C,\nN, and O abundances are then adjusted in an attempt to reproduce the behavior of the observed\nstars.\n\n2.\n\nTHE ADOPTED MODELS AND VERIFICATION OF THEIR VALIDITY\n\nThe first step in our analysis is to demonstrate that the adopted model points are a satisfactory\nmatch to the observed stars in the region of the main sequence turnoff for M13 and for M71. The\nisochrones used here are from the O-enhanced grid of Bergbusch & VandenBerg (1992).\nAssuming a metallicity of [F e/H] = \u22120.80 for M71 (Sneden et al. 1994), seven Tef f /log g\npoints were chosen from the 14 Gyr [F e/H] = \u22120.78 isochrone spanning a range in luminosity of\n4.7 < MV < 3.0. Model atmospheres were calculated for each of these points using the MARCS\nprogram (Gustafsson et al. 1975) which were then fed into the synthetic spectrum generating\nprogram SSG (Bell & Gustafsson 1978; Gustafsson & Bell 1979; Bell & Gustafsson 1989; Bell,\nPaltoglou, & Tripicco 1994) using the linelist of Tripicco & Bell (1995). Each synthetic spectrum\nwas initially computed from 3,000 to 12,000\u00c5 in 0.1\u00c5 intervals and convolved with V, R, I filter\ncurves as described in Gustafsson & Bell (1979) and Bell & Gustafsson (1989) to yield colors\nappropriate to each model. These colors are listed in Tables 1 and 2. Figure 1(a) compares the\nisochrone colors with the V , I photometry (corrected for reddening) of Stetson (2000) of \u2248 4000\nstars with V < 20 in M71. A distance of 3.9 kpc and a reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.25 mag was\nassumed from the on line compilation of Harris (1996).\nA similar approach was followed in the case of M13 where a metallicity of [F e/H] = \u22121.51\n(Kraft et al. 1992) was assumed. Model points were chosen from the 16 Gyr [F e/H] = \u22121.48 grid.\nThe corresponding colors are given in Table 2 and plotted in Figure 1(b) with the V , I photometry\nof Stetson (2000). For M13 a distance of 7.2 kpc and a reddening of E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.02 was used\n(Harris 1996), however, an additional 0.11 magnitudes in (m \u2212 M )V (i.e., a 5% increase in distance)\nwas required for the best fit to the observed CMD.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nAlso plotted in both panels of Figure 1 are the locations of the Keck program stars in the\ncluster CMDs. The isochrones and models adopted for M71 and M13 are shown to be a good\nmatch, with the spread about the isochrone consistent with observational errors in the case of M13.\nFor M71, the spread is broader, but still consistent with a combination of observational errors,\nreddening variations at a level of 10% of the total reddening (see Cohen & Sleeper 1995), and\npossibly a few non-members.\n\n3.\n\nTHE OBSERVED CN AND CH INDICES\n\nThe I(uvCN) index employed by Cohen (1999a,b) measured the flux removed by the 3883\u00c5 CN\nfeature as a fraction relative to a nearby single-side continuum bandpass. Unfortunately, the\nobserved spectra are not flux calibrated and therefore include the signature of the instrumental\nresponse. The affect of this is to cause offsets in one-sided indices such as I(uvCN) (although we\nnote that for comparisons between stars of similar luminosities, this is not an issue as they all share\nsimilar offsets).\nTo facilitate removal of this signature and for comparisons with synthetic spectra, we have\nre-measured the uv CN feature using the S(3839) index (Norris et al. 1981). Because S(3839) is\nthe logarithm of the ratio between a comparison bandpass and a CN \"feature\" bandpass, slopes\ninduced by instrumental response result in constant zero-point shifts in the indices which can be\nquantified and removed. For the present observations, the shift in the index was measured using the\ncontinuum fitting routine of IRAF's \"splot\" package. Each spectrum was fitted with a third order\ncubic spline and the S(3839) index computed from each fit. The resulting offset was 0.180\u00b10.008\nand 0.178\u00b10.007 for the M71 and M13 spectra, respectively. For the double sided I(CH) (Cohen\n1999a), a much smaller shift of \u22120.009\u00b10.003 was found in the case of M71 and \u22120.004\u00b10.006\nin M13. As the fits also include the actual stellar continua, the same procedure was adopted\nfor the synthetic spectra as well (we are essentially comparing indices of flattened spectra). One\nsigma errors in S(3839) were also calculated from Poisson statistics in the feature and continuum\nbandpasses.\n\n4.\n\nTHE COMPUTATION OF THE CN AND CH INDICES FROM SYNTHETIC\nSPECTRA\n\nFor each of the model Tef f /log g points taken from the isochrones, high resolution synthetic\nspectra were generated using the SSG code. Scaled solar abundances based on the metallicities\nabove were adopted with differing C/N/O abundances (discussed below). These spectra were\ncomputed from 3,000 to 6,000\u00c5 at a wavelength step size of 0.02\u00c5 and a microturbulent velocity\nof 1.5 km/s. They were then convolved with a Gaussian of width 8\u00c5 to match the resolution of\nthe observed spectra. S(3839) and I(CH) indices were measured from the smoothed spectra and\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nare given in Tables 1 and 2. As with the observed spectra, the smoothed synthetic spectra were\nimported into IRAF and the continuum fitted with the splot routine. Indices measured from the\nresulting fits yielded a zero point shift of 0.025\u00b10.001 in S(3839) for both M71 and M13 spectra.\nThe C/N/O abundances used in the calculation of synthetic spectra for M71 are based on\nabundances used by Briley et al. (2001) in a DDO photometric study of M71 bright giants. Using\nCN sensitive C(4142) and CH sensitive C(4245) colors it was found that the locus of CN-weak\ngiants of M71 were best fit by [C/F e]=0.0, [N/F e]=+0.4, [O/F e]=+0.4 and by [C/F e]=\u22120.3,\n[N/F e]=+1.4, [O/F e]=+0.2 for the CN-strong stars. To aid in comparison with the present mainsequence stars, their results are shown in Figure 2.\nFor M13, Smith et al. (1996) performed an analysis of CN and CH band strengths in eleven\nof the cluster's bright giants. Their resulting abundances centered roughly about [C/F e]=\u22120.85,\n[N/F e]=+0.7, [O/F e]=+0.4 and [C/F e]=\u22121.1, [N/F e]=+1.2, [O/F e]=\u22120.5 for the CN-weak and\nstrong giants respectively and a set of models with these compositions have been calculated here.\nHowever, the low [C/Fe] abundances of the evolved giants also suggests a deep mixing process\nmay have altered the initial C/N/O abundances of these stars. As a test of this possibility, we\nhave also calculated a set of models assuming arbitrary \"pre-mixing\" abundances of [C/F e]=0.0,\n[N/F e]=+0.4, [O/F e]=+0.4 and [C/F e]=\u22120.3, [N/F e]=+0.9, [O/F e]=0.0 (with the requirement\nthat the total number of C/N/O atoms remain constant).\n\n5.\n\nDISCUSSION\n5.1.\n\nM71\n\nThe observed CN and CH band strengths for 77 M71 main-sequence stars are plotted against\ntheir brightness in R (see Cohen 1999b) in Figure 3. The stars have arbitrarily been divided\ninto CN-weak and strong groups based on their S(3839) indices. As was pointed out by Cohen\n(1999b), the sample falls into a bimodal distribution with a pronounced CN/CH anticorrelation.\nThis pattern is evident among the more luminous giants of the cluster as well (see Figure 2).\nMoreover, the relative numbers of CN-weak and strong stars are remarkably similar: for the bright\ngiants, 48 are CN-weak and 30 are strong. Among the main-sequence stars, 44 are weak and 31 are\nstrong. Three stars marked as diamonds in Figure 3 have anomalously large CN indicies. Based on\nradial velocities from higher dispersion spectra to be presented in a later paper, one of these three\nstars (star 1951333+184107) is not a member of M71 and star 1951311+183525 is probably not a\nmember.\nAlso plotted in Figure 3 are the indices measured from the synthetic spectra described above\nusing the same set of C/N/O abundances which fit the giants in Figure 2 (the zero point shifts\nin the indices have been applied). The agreement between the fits of the CN and CH sensitive\nindices in both the giants and main-sequence stars is remarkably good, suggesting similar C and\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nN abundances in the two samples and little change in these abundances over the six magnitudes\nobserved.\nSimilar results have also been found among the giants and main-sequence stars of 47 Tucanae,\na nearby cluster of comparable metallicity to M71. The C/N/O abundances used here are very close\nto those used by Briley (2001) to fit the CN and CH band strengths of 283 giants, the only difference\nbeing an [O/F e] of +0.45 assumed for both CN-weak and CN-strong giants in 47 Tuc. Among\nthe main-sequence stars, spectroscopic abundance studies have also yielded C and N abundances\nsimilar to those found among the 47 Tuc giants (see Briley et al. 1994 and Cannon et al. 1998).\nThus both M71 and 47 Tuc, two relatively metal-rich clusters, appear to show little evidence\nof change in C/N/O abundances from the upper main-sequence through the bright giants. This\nis in striking contrast to the significant (factor of ten) C depletions with luminosity seen among\nthe more metal-poor clusters such as M92, M15, and NGC 6397 (see references in the reviews\nmentioned above). While at first appearing contradictory, the difference may well be the result\nof the higher H-burning shell temperatures and smaller mean molecular weight gradients found in\nmore metal-poor stars (as discussed by Sweigart & Mengel 1979, Charbonnel 1995, Cavallo et al.\n1996, 1998, and others) which should lead to increasingly significant C/N/O abundance changes\ndue to dredge-up with decreasing metallicity. The present results then do not rule out the operation\nof deep dredge-up in evolving cluster giants, particularly in metal-poor stars.\nHowever, it is clear the process responsible for the C and N inhomogeneities in M71 and 47 Tuc\ncannot be deep mixing during the ascent of the RGB: the bulk of the inhomogeneities are in place\nat the main sequence turn-off. Moreover, the shallow convective zones and low rates of CN-cycle\nprocessing in low mass cluster main sequence stars make mixing on the main sequence an unlikely\nscenario. One is then left with the possibilities of a primordial inhomogeneity or some pollution\nmechanism operating early in the cluster histories. In this regard, M71 provides an interesting data\npoint as it is almost four magnitudes fainter in luminosity than 47 Tuc (Harris 1996) and would\nbe required to be considerably more massive in the past (not an unlikely scenario given M71's low\ngalactic latitude) if the observed inhomogeneities are indeed due to retained gas from intermediate\nmass AGB stars.\n\n5.2.\n\nM13\n\nThe situation in M13 is considerably different from M71. With its lower metallicity, both the\nhotter main-sequence turn-off and lower numbers of both C and N atoms conspire to greatly reduce\nCN formation. This can be seen in Figure 4 where the S(3839) indices of the program stars with V\nphotometry of Stetson (2000) are plotted against the indices from the synthetic spectra. Despite\nsignificant differences in the C and N abundances used in the models, the 3883\u00c5 CN band is in\nall cases too weak to be detected and cannot be used to constrain N abundance variations among\nthe M13 main-sequence stars. There does appear to be some CH formation, however the band is\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ntoo weak to be useful at the signal level of our spectra at depletions of [C/F e] \u2248 \u22120.3 or greater\nat the main sequence turn-off.\nWe do note the two more luminous M13 stars (at R = 17.9) which do apparently exhibit a \u2248\n0.3 dex difference in [C/F e]. Their C abundances are also substantially greater than C abundances\nfound among eleven bright M13 giants by Smith et al. (1996) which averaged near [C/F e] = \u22121.\nThis result, although only based on two stars, is consistent with an episode of deep mixing taking\nplace on the M13 RGB as has also been suggested by the high resolution Na study of Pilachowski\net al. (1996).\nWe are very grateful to Peter Stetson for providing access to his photometric database.

For M71, the published coordinates are within 1.5 arcsec of the astrometric coordinates.\nFor M13, the published coordinates for objects in Field 2 are of comparable accuracy. However,\nthe coordinates published in Cohen (1999a) for main sequence stars in field 1 of M13 are 0.3 sec of\ntime West and 7 arc sec South of the astrometric coordinates.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nREFERENCES\nBell, R.
