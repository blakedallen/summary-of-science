Introduction\nThe study of Calabi-Yau compactifications [1] has been tremendously fruitful. These\nmodels play an important role in deriving realistic models of low-energy particle physics\nfrom the heterotic string. Their study has also lead to fascinating discoveries about stringy\ngeometry and mathematical physics [2].\nMore recently, it has become clear that Calabi-Yau compactifications of type II strings\nare also a reasonable starting point for model building. In orientifolds of such models, Dbranes wrapping various cycles give rise to non-Abelian gauge groups, and can yield a\nreasonable facsimile of the Standard Model [3]. Background RR and NS fluxes can also\nbe included, and generate a computable (super)potential which stabilizes many of the\nmoduli fields [4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15]. In addition, the fluxes and branes backreact\non the bulk geometry, yielding warped compactifications [16,5,17]. In special cases, the\nwarping can be a large effect [18,9,19,20]. This provides a natural mechanism for explaining\nhierachies of scales, as suggested by Randall and Sundrum [21].\nHowever, such Calabi-Yau orientifolds are merely the tip of the iceberg. One way\nto see this is as follows. Starting from the type IIB theory on a Calabi-Yau space M in\nabsence of NS three-form flux H, one can construct a dual type IIA description of the same\n\nphysics in terms of a mirror Calabi-Yau W . On the other hand, in the presence of generic\n\nH-flux on M , the mirror geometry W can no longer be a Calabi-Yau space. This is clear\n\nbecause mirror symmetry is a kind of generalization of T-duality [22], and T-duality maps\nnontrivial H to an interesting deformation of the T-dual metric.\n\nIn this way, starting from a solution of the IIB theory on a Calabi-Yau orientifold with\n\nbackground fluxes, one can generate mirror IIA geometries which are not (orientifolds of\na) Calabi-Yau, but are supersymmetric solutions of the equations of motion. It should be\nclear that more generically, one can construct models which are not described by CalabiYau geometries in either picture. For instance, turning on generic NS flux in the IIA non\nCalabi-Yau geometry will result in solutions whose IIB dual is no longer a Calabi-Yau\nspace.\nThe resulting models are of interest for phenomenological reasons as well. They are\ntypically expected to have fewer moduli than conventional Calabi-Yau compactifications.\nIn addition, the computable potential on moduli space could, in some cases, be useful from\na cosmological viewpoint (for a recent investigation in this direction see [23]).\nHere, we describe the simplest examples of such new supersymmetric compactifications of type II strings. Our starting point is the T 6 /Z2 orientifold of type IIB theory\n1\n\n\fin the presence of NS and RR three-form fluxes, discussed in detail in [12,13]. In simple\nenough cases these models possess classical isometries, and by performing Buscher duality\ntransformations [24], one is able to construct dual solutions which are not Calabi-Yau geometries. Instead, we find that the dual manifolds are well described as cosets, generalizing\nthe three-dimensional nilmanifold. They can also be thought of as twisted tori, first studied\nin [25]. The light scalar fields in these models are governed by a (super)potential which is\ngenerated by both the fluxes and certain gravitational charges which can be formed from\nthe background metric [26].\nThis paper concerns itself with type II strings, but similar questions are also of interest\nin the context of the heterotic string. Once again, one would like to ask about supersymmetric vacua in the presence of the three-form NS flux [27]. Little is known about such\nmodels, but in some cases these heterotic vacua are dual to the type II ones.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows. In \u00a72, we briefly review the class of models\n\nstudied in [12] and discuss how T-duality in the presence of H-flux generates twisted tori\nby describing a simple toy example. In \u00a73, we derive various dual descriptions of the\nT 6 /Z2 flux vacua, which exhibit generalizations of the twisting encountered in \u00a72. For\n\nillustration we present a detailed discussion of an N = 2 supersymmetric compactification\nto 4d with several dual descriptions involving non Calabi-Yau geometries. We also find\nthat consideration of the M-theory limit indicates that this example can be connected\n(on the moduli space of vacua) to a smooth type II Calabi-Yau compactification (with no\norientifolding). In \u00a74, we directly derive the supersymmetry conditions in the dual pictures,\n\nand write down an effective 4d superpotential which imposes these constraints. We also\nverify that this superpotential correctly reproduces expected domain wall tensions, in the\nspirit of [4,28]. We close with some comments on further directions for research in \u00a75. In\n\ntwo appendices, we summarize the T-duality formulae for the transformations of IIA/IIB\nfields and spinors which are used throughout the paper.\nWe end by commenting on some recent related work. The papers [29,30,31] discuss\nflux compactifications and their relation to gauged supergravity. While this work was in\nprogress, we also became aware of several related projects. Work which has significant\noverlap with the present paper appeared recently in [32,33]. Heterotic string compactifications on non Calabi-Yau spaces related by duality to the models studied in [12] have\nappeared in [34] (and earlier work in this direction appeared in [27,5]). Other compactifications which involve \"duality twists\" and are related indirectly to the twisted tori which\nappear in \u00a72 have appeared in [35,36]. Finally, some of our results were also found by S.\n\nGukov [37].\n\n2\n\n\f2. Basic Formalism\n2.1. Flux vacua in IIB on T 6 /Z2\nThe theories that we will discuss in subsequent sections are all related via T-duality to\nIIB theory compactified on a T 6 /Z2 orientifold. In this orientifold, the Z2 acts to invert all\nsix circles. In the absence of flux, the theory is T-dual to the type I theory, and preserves\nN = 4 supersymmetry. Since there are 64 O3 planes located at the fixed-points of the\nZ2 , RR tadpole cancellation requires that there also be 16 space-filling D3 branes. These\nare the T-duals of 16 D9 branes of SO(32) in Type I, and the low energy effective field\ntheory is the same SO(32) N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, coupled to N = 4\nsupergravity, familiar from Type I.\nHowever, this is not the most general solution to the T 6 /Z2 tadpole cancellation\ncondition. This class of compactifications also admits different superselection sectors in\nwhich we turn on quantized NS-NS and RR three-form fluxes. Let H3 denote the NS-\n\nNS flux and F3 denote the RR flux.1 These field-strengths satisfy a Dirac quantization\ncondition\n1\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03b1\u2032\n\nZ\n\n1\nF3 = m\u03b3 \u2208 Z,\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03b1\u2032\n\u03b3\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3\n\nH3 = n\u03b3 \u2208 Z,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere \u03b3 labels the classes in H3 (T 6 , Z). In the presence of such fluxes, the D3 brane charge\ntadpole cancellation condition reads 2 :\n1\nNflux + ND3 = 16\n2\nwhere\nNflux\n\n1\n=\n(2\u03c0)4 \u03b1\u20322\n\nZ\n\nT6\n\nH3 \u2227 F3 .\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nSo if we turn on fluxes, we should in general introduce fewer D3 branes.\n1\n\nThe calligraphic font on the NS-flux indicates that it is a quantity associated with the IIB\n\norientifold that we are now discussing, and not with one of the T-dual theories that we will describe\nin later sections. Confusion is less likely for the RR flux, which changes rank under T-duality, so\nwe do not use the calligraphic notation in the RR-sector.\n2\n\nAs in [12], we ignore the possibility of exotic O3 planes. To consistently do this, we must\n\nchoose the integers in (2.1) to be even, as explained in [13]. This will be sufficient for our purposes.\n\n3\n\n\fNonvanishing fluxes give rise to an effective superpotential for the Calabi-Yau complex\nstructure moduli [4]. (A detailed derivation of this in the context of IIB orientifolds was\ngiven in App. A of [9]). The superpotential is\nZ\nW = G3 \u2227 \u03a9,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere\nG3 = F3 \u2212 \u03c6H3\n\n(2.5)\n\nand \u03c6 is the IIB axio-dilaton. It follows that supersymmetric vacua are located at points in\ncomplex structure moduli space where G is of type (2,1) and imaginary self-dual. Furthermore, for supersymmetry, the K\u00e4hler structure J should be chosen to make G3 primitive\n(i.e. satisfy J \u2227 G3 = 0). These conditions were studied in detail for the case of T 6 /Z2 in\n\n[12], and it was found that for generic choices of the fluxes (2.1) there are no supersym-\n\nmetric critical points. However, for suitable non-generic choices of flux, one can find vacua\nwith N = 1, 2, 3 supersymmetry (and reduced numbers of moduli).\n\nIn the absence of flux, these models admit isometries and various T-dual descriptions\n\nexist. The RR three-form flux transforms quite simply under T-duality. Our goal in the\nfollowing subsections will be to explore what happens when one tries to construct analogous\nT-dual descriptions in the presence of nontrivial H3 -flux.\n\nBefore moving on, we should note one further interesting feature of these models. The\n\nfluxes and transverse branes and O-planes act as sources for a nontrivial warping of the\nmetric. The 10-metric in string frame takes the form\nds2 = e\u22122A \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + e2A g\u0303mn dxm dxn\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3 and m, n = 4, * * * , 9. The metric g\u0303mn is the unwarped metric on the\ncompactification space. The warp-factor e2A is determined by the equation\n \u0303 2 e4A = (2\u03c0)4 (\u03b1\u2032 )2 gs \u03c1\u03033 +\n\u2212\u2207\n\ngs\nm\ng\nnp\nGmnp G\n12\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere tildes denote the use of the unwarped metric, and \u03c13 refers to the localized D3charge density (which gets contributions from both D3 branes and O3 planes). One can\nargue as in [9,13] that under rescaling the metric g\u0303mn \u2192 \u03bb2 g\u0303mn , the warp factor behaves\n\nlike e2A \u223c 1 + O(\u03bb\u22124 ). Therefore, at large radius and weak coupling, where one trusts\n\nthe supergravity equations, the corrections due to the warp factor are negligible. In the\n\nexamples we provide in this paper, one can choose the moduli to lie in a regime where one\ncan neglect the warping.\n4\n\n\f2.2. A warm-up: The twisted torus\nAs a preliminary indication of what to expect, let us consider the following simple toy\nmodel. Imagine starting with a square three-torus M parametrized by x, y, z, with metric\nds2 = dx2 + dy 2 + dz 2 .\nSuppose one has also turned on N units of NS three-form flux through this torus\nZ\n1\nH3 = N.\n(2\u03c0)2 (\u03b1\u2032 ) M\n\n(2.8)\n\n(2.9)\n\nWe can choose a gauge where\nByz = N x\n\n(2.10)\n\nwith other components vanishing. (From now on, we set (2\u03c0)2 \u03b1\u2032 = 1 for convenience).\nNow, imagine T-dualizing along the z direction. In the T-dual, the B field vanishes.\nThe resulting T-dual metric is\nds2 = dx2 + dy 2 + (dz + N xdy)2\n\n(2.11)\n\nWe will call such a space a \"twisted torus\" or a \"nilmanifold,\" following [38] and [39]\nrespectively. The identifications to be made in interpreting (2.11) are not the same as in\na standard T 3 . Instead one should identify3\n(x, y, z) \u223c\n= (x, y + 1, z) \u223c\n= (x, y, z + 1) \u223c\n= (x + 1, y, z \u2212 N y).\n\n(2.12)\n\nThis space has another convenient description, as a coset. Consider R3 , presented as\nthe space of upper triangular 3 \u00d7 3 matrices with ones along the diagonal:\n\uf8eb\n\n1 y\n\uf8ed\ngN (x, y, z) = 0 1\n0 0\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212 N1 z\nx \uf8f8\n1\n\n(2.13)\n\nwhere x, y, z are real numbers. Let us call this group G3N (R). For any N , this group is\n\nisomorphic to the three-dimensional Heisenberg group H3 . We can also define G3N (Z) by\nconsidering analogous matrices\n3\n\nThe nontrivial identification (x, y, z) \u223c\n= (x+1, y, z\u2212N y) is necessary in order that dz+N xdy =\n\nd(z \u2212 N y) + N (x + 1)dy be globally well-defined.\n\n5\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\n1\ngN (a, b, c) = \uf8ed 0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\nb \u2212 N1 c\n1\na \uf8f8\n0\n1\n\n(2.14)\n\nwith a, b, c integers. This has a natural action on G3N (R) by matrix multiplication. Consider the right-coset M = G3N (R)/G3N (Z). The resulting identifications are\n(x, y, z) \u223c (x + a, y + b, z \u2212 N by + c).\n\n(2.15)\n\nA little thought shows that the spaces (2.15) are the same as the twisted tori (2.12).\nSince these spaces were obtained as a right-coset, we would naively expect the twisted\ntori to possess an isometry group corresponding to left-multiplication by G3N (R). However,\n\nthe one-forms appearing in the metric (2.11) are the right-invariant forms \u03b7 1 = dx, \u03b7 2 = dy,\n\n\u22121\n(x, y, z).4 The would-be Killing\n\u03b7 3 = dz + N xdy, defined by gN (\u03b7 1 , \u03b7 2 , \u03b7 3 ) = dgN gN\n\nvectors that generate left-multiplication are the right-invariant vector fields k1 = \u2202x , k2 =\n\u2202y \u2212N x\u2202z , k3 = \u2202z , dual to the \u03b7 i . Of these, only k3 is actually an isometry of the metric.5\n\nThe isometry is the U (1) of translations in the z-direction.\n\nIt is easy to see that the twisted torus is topologically distinct from the untwisted torus.\nFor instance, h1 (M ) = 2 for M = the twisted T 3 . One can prove this as follows. Since\n\u0001\nG3N (R) is topologically R3 , it follows that \u03c01 G3N (R)/G3N (Z) = G3N (Z). The homology\ngroup H1 (M, Z) is the abelianization of this group, that is, the group G3N (Z) modulo\n\nits commutator subgroup. (Here commutator mean group-commutator XY X \u22121 Y \u22121 , as\nopposed to algebra-commutator XY \u2212 Y X). It is easy to show that the commutator\n\nsubgroup is generated by eN , where e = gN (0, 0, 1). The group H1 (Z) is then Z \u00d7 Z \u00d7 ZN ,\n4\n\nNote that the positive-definite metric (2.11) is not same as the Cartan metric Tr dg dg, which\n\nis easily seen to vanish. (Since the group is non-semi-simple, the usual theorem that the Cartan\nmetric is positive-definite does not apply).\n5\n\nThe reader is invited to check that the nonvanishing Lie derivatives of the form Lk \u03b7 are\n\nLk1 \u03b7 = N dy and Lk2 \u03b7 3 = \u2212N dx. Consequently, only Lk3 acting on the metric is nonzero.\n3\n\nAnother way to understand this is in terms of the generators of right-multiplication. All of\nthese generators are compatible with the metric, but only k3 (which has a dual interpretation as\ngenerator of either left- or right-multiplication) is compatible with the quotienting that defines\nthe coset. That is, k3 is the only generator of right-multiplication that lies in the commutant of\nG N (Z) in G N (R).\n\n6\n\n\fwith the first factor generated by gN (1, 0, 0), the second by gN (0, 1, 0), and the third by e\nmodulo eN . The real-valued homology group is H1 (M, R) = R2 , of dimension two.6\nUsing Cartan's structure equation\nd\u03b7 a + \u03c9 a b \u2227 \u03b7 b = T a = 0,\n\nT a = torsion,\n\n(2.16)\n\nit is straightforward to solve for the spin connection of the twisted T 3 . We have\nd\u03b7 1 = d\u03b7 2 = 0,\n\nd\u03b7 3 = N \u03b7 1 \u2227 \u03b7 2 ,\n\n(2.17)\n\nso the solution is\n\u03c9 1 2 = \u2212 12 N \u03b7 3 ,\n\n\u03c9 2 3 = 21 N \u03b7 1 ,\n\n\u03c9 3 1 = 21 N \u03b7 2 .\n\n(2.18)\n\nTaking the antisymmetric part of the spin-connection, we obtain a three-form\n\u03c9(3) = \u03b7 a \u2227 \u03b7 b \u2227 \u03c9ab = N \u03b7 1 \u2227 \u03b7 2 \u2227 \u03b7 3 .\n\n(2.19)\n\nThis illustrates a general rule. When a component of NS flux is lost through T-duality,\nit reappears in the antisymmetrized spin-connection as\n\u03c9(3) = k \u2227 FKK + . . . ,\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere k is the Killing one-form of the isometry, and FKK is the flux of the corresponding\nKaluza-Klein gauge field [26]. In this case, AKK = N xdy, FKK = N dx \u2227 dy, and k =\n\ngzm dxm = dz + N xdy.\n\nThis toy model is not really a solution of the string equations of motion: If one tries to\ncompactify on a T 3 with H3 -flux, both the string coupling and the volume of the torus have\n\ntadpoles and want to relax to extreme values. However, in the more elaborate backgrounds\n\nreviewed in \u00a72.1, one can find stable toroidal compactifications with both H3 and F flux.\n\nThen, dualizing along any isometry directions will yield new stable vacua, with \"twistings\"\nquite analogous to the one above. These vacua will also have a convenient description as\ncosets.\nOne final comment before we move on. Starting with the metric (2.8) and B field\n\n(2.10), we have discussed the geometry which results after one T-duality. It is interesting\n6\n\nThe interpretation of the torsion factor ZN is that that there is a third one-cycle, around\n\nwhich string winding is conserved modulo N . This is the T-dual of the statement that momentum\non the original T 3 is conserved modulo N in the presence of N units of NS-flux.\n\n7\n\n\fto ask what happens on doing additional T-dualities. The geometry (2.11) (with B = 0)\nis independent of the y direction. T-dualizing further along this direction gives rise (using\nthe T-duality rules in App. A) to the metric\nds2 =\nand B field\n\n1\n(dz 2 + dy 2 ) + dx2\n2\n2\n1+N x\n\n(2.21)\n\nNx\n.\n(2.22)\n1 + N 2 x2\nThis background looks quite puzzling at first. For example, on going around the x circle the\nByz =\n\n2\nmetric of the z, y two-torus, T{yz}\n, is not periodic even up to an SL(2, Z) transformation\n\n(2.21).\nA little more thought shows that the metric (2.21) and B field (2.22) are in fact periodic\n\nup to an element of O(2, 2, Z) which does not belong to SL(2, Z). This can be understood\n\n2\nas follows. In the metric (2.11), on going around the x circle, the two-torus T{yz}\nis twisted\n\nby an element of SL(2, Z) which we denote as A. T-duality along the y direction, which\nwe denote as Ty , does not commute with A. As a result in the final solution the metric\nand B field, (2.21) and (2.22), twist by the transformation Ty\u22121 ATy \u2208 O(2, 2, Z) on going\naround the x circle.\n\nThe facts above imply that the supergravity approximation is not adequate to describe\n2\nthis background. Momentum modes along the Tyz\nmix with winding modes on going\n\naround the x circle. Since this paper restricts itself to the supergravity approximation,\nwe do not consider backgrounds of this sort any further. We follow a simple rule to avoid\nthem: never T-dualize twice along two directions a, b, if [H3 ]abc 6= 0 for any direction c in\n\nthe starting configuration. Twists by elements of the O(2, 2, Z) duality group have been\nconsidered in [35,36].\n2.3. Twisted Tori in General\n\nThe nilmanifold and related generalizations we discussed above are in fact examples\nof twisted tori discussed in the seminal paper of Scherk and Schwarz [25].\nOne way to think about twisted tori in general is as follows (see also [38]): They\nare parallelizable manifolds with a well defined, nowhere vanishing basis of vielbein fields.\nBelow, we denote this basis of vielbein one-forms as \u03b7 a , a = 1, . . . , n. The coordinate basis\none-forms dx\u03b1 are related to the vielbein \u03b7 a by\n\u03b7 a = U (x)a\u03b1 dx\u03b1 .\n8\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fThe quantity U \u2208 GL(n, R) is a matrix which specifies the twisting.\n\nIn particular the twisting matrix U must satisfy an important property. The coeffi-\n\na\ncients fbc\n, defined by\n\n1 a b\nd\u03b7 a = \u2212 fbc\n\u03b7 \u2227 \u03b7c ,\n2\n\n(2.24)\n\nmust be constant on a twisted torus. Following [25], we refer to these coefficients as\nstructure constants.\nNote that as a result the spin connection is also a constant on a twisted torus. This\nfollows because the spin connection can be expressed in terms of the structure constants\nas\nc\nwab\n=\n\n1 c\ns\ns\n(f \u2212 \u03b4bs \u03b4 cj faj\n\u2212 \u03b4 cj \u03b4as fbj\n),\n2 ab\n\n(2.25)\n\n(where \u03b4 bs etc denote the Kronecker delta symbol). Finally, it is worth mentioning that in\nthe low-energy theory obtained after KK reduction on a twisted torus, masses for moduli\nand (non abelian) gauge couplings can arise. These depend only on the structure constants,\nand have no other depndence on the twisting matrix U .\nLet us see how this general discussion applies to the examples of \u00a72.2. Consider the\n\nvielbein (2.11)\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ndx\n\u03b71\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8ed \u03b72 \uf8f8 = \uf8ed\ndy\n3\n\u03b7\ndz + N xdy\n\uf8eb\n\n(2.26)\n\nNote first that the \u03b7 a are well defined on the twisted torus. In particular as mentioned\nin the footnote after (2.12), \u03b7 3 twists by the appropriate SL(2, Z) transformation in going\naround the x circle. The twisting matrix U can be read off from (2.26), and is:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 0\n1 0\uf8f8\nNx 1\n\n1\nU = \uf8ed0\n0\n\n(2.27)\n\n3\n3\nThe structure constants then take the form f12\n= \u2212f21\n= \u2212N , with all other components\n\nvanishing. They are indeed constant 7 . Thus the generalized nilmanifolds of \u00a72.2 have all\nthe properties of twisted tori discussed in [25].\n7\n\n8\n\na\nStrictly speaking, once the effects of warping are included the coefficients fbc\nare no longer\n\nconstant. In this sense the compactification is a generalisation of the twisted torus considered in\n[25].\n8\n\na\n= 0. This too is met by\nThere is one more condition on the structure constants in [25], fab\n\nthe example of \u00a72.2.\n\n9\n\n\fThere is another way to connect our discussion of twisted tori above with nilmania\nfolds. The structure constants fbc\nin general define a (non-compact) Lie algebra. For the\n\ntwisted torus of \u00a72.2 this is the Heisenberg algebra (with N playing the role of h\u0304). The\n\ncorresponding group is the group of upper triangular matrices G. The nilmanifolds are\ncosets of exactly this group by appropriate discrete subgroups.\n\n3. New geometries from T 6 /Z2\n3.1. A detailed example\nFor concreteness, it is helpful to describe explicitly a nontrivial example where one\ncan see the considerations of the previous subsections come into play. As our starting\npoint, we take the N = 2 supersymmetric flux compactification on T 6 /Z2 which played an\n\nimportant role in [40]. The fluxes are chosen to be:\n\nF3 = 2dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dy 3 + 2dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dy 3\n\n(3.1)\n\nH3 = 2dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 + 2dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dx3\n\n(3.2)\n\n(Again, here and in the rest of the paper, we set equal to 1 the factor of (2\u03c0)2 \u03b1\u2032 that should\nappear on the RHS when specifying each of the fluxes). The factors of 2 are inserted to\navoid various subtleties related to \"exotic\" O3 planes which arise when the fluxes aren't\neven. It follows from the equations of [12] that this model has a moduli space of N = 2\n\nsupersymmetric vacua. Along this moduli space, the T 6 looks like a (T 2 )3 . The three T 2 's\n\nlie in the xi y i directions, with i = 1, 2, 3, respectively. The complex structure moduli \u03c41,2,3\nof the three two-tori, together with the axio-dilaton \u03c6, satisfy the equations\n\u03c6\u03c43 = \u22121\n\n(3.3)\n\n\u03c41 \u03c42 = \u22121\n\n(3.4)\n\nThere are also K\u00e4hler moduli which are constrained only by the primitivity condition. For\nsimplicity, we work at a point in moduli space where the metric is diagonal with radii\nRxi , Ryi . The constraints on the moduli (3.3) and (3.4) can be written in terms of the\nradii using \u03c4i = iRyi /Rxi .\nThis is a nongeneric situation; for generic choices of flux, the complex structure and\n\u03c6 would have been completely frozen. But it is convenient to consider such an example,\n10\n\n\fwhere the fluxes are quite simple, for several reasons. One is that then the dual geometries\nare also quite simple. The other, perhaps more important, reason is that then one can\nargue that the dual description is at large radius (and weak coupling), and hence the dual\ngeometry is meaningful, for an appropriate regime of parameters.\nChoose a gauge where\nBx1 x3 = 2x2 , By1 x3 = 2y 2\n\n(3.5)\n\nare the nonvanishing components of the B\u03bc\u03bd field on the internal space. It is an easy\n\nmatter to find various dual geometries now. We want to avoid the subtleties which arise,\nas described in \u00a72.2, when one attempts to dualize two directions which appear in a de-\n\ncomposable piece of H. We see that while avoiding this, we can still safely perform three\nT-dualities (along the x1 , y 1 and y 3 directions) in this model.\nLet us make one more comment. In the discussion below, to focus on the essential\nfeatures, we neglect the effects of the warp factor (2.6), (2.7). As mentioned in section\n2, this is a good approximation for large volume. More complete formulae with the warp\nfactor can be found in section 4, in the discussion of supersymmetry.\nOne T-Duality: A IIA Dual\nThere are several choices for the order in which one performs the dualities. It is clear\nthat dualizing the y 3 circle does not yield any twisting in the geometry of the dual, so we\nshall save that for our last transformation.\nWe will obtain a more interesting result by first dualizing along, say, the x1 direction.\nAfter performing one T-duality along this direction, we obtain a model where the metric\nnow has a nontrivial 2 \u00d7 2 block in the x1 x3 coordinates:\n3\nX\n1\n1\n2\n3 2\n2\n2 2\n2\n3 2\nds = 2 (dx + 2x dx ) + Rx2 (dx ) + Rx3 (dx ) +\nRy2i (dy i )2 .\nRx1\ni=1\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nIn other words, the x1 , x2 , x3 coordinates are sweeping out the nilmanifold encountered in\n\u00a72.2, while the y i still live on a square T 3 .\n\nIn this description, one still has a residual H3 -field\nH3 = 2dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dx3 , By1 x3 = 2y 2\n\n(3.7)\n\nalong with RR two-form and four-form fluxes\nF2 = 2dx2 \u2227 dy 3\n11\n\n(3.8)\n\n\fF4 = 2(dx1 + 2x2 dx3 ) \u2227 dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dy 3 .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe O3 planes have turned into O4 planes wrapping the x1 circle.\nThe constraints on moduli (3.3), (3.4) can be easily re-written in terms of the new\ntype IIA variables. They read\n\u03c11 \u03c42 = \u22121\n\n(3.10)\n\nR\u0303x1 \u03c6\u03c43 = \u22121\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere \u03c11 is the volume modulus \u03c11 = iR\u0303x1 Ry1 , R\u0303x1 = 1/Rx1 is the radius of the T-dualized\ncircle in the IIA theory, and all other quantities refer to IIA variables as well. It is clear that\nby choosing the point in moduli space appropriately, one can make this T-dual description\nthe effective description, as compared to the IIB starting point.\nNotice that it follows from App. A that the piece of the H-field which had a leg along\nthe x1 direction is encoded after the duality transformation in the spin-connection \u03c9 in\nthe IIA theory. In the notation of App. A, one finds that\ng(x1 ) = 2x2 dx3 ,\n\n\u03c9(x1 ) = \u22122dx2 \u2227 dx3 .\n\n(3.12)\n\nHere, g(x1 ) is the Kaluza-Klein gauge-field corresponding to the isometry in the x1 direction, and \u2212\u03c9(x1 ) = dg(x1 ) is the corresponding field-strength. The Killing one-form\n\ncorresponding to this isometry is k = \u03b7 1 /Rx2 1 , where \u03b7 1 = (dx1 + 2x2 dx3 ). So, as in \u00a72.2\n\nand [26], the antisymmetrized spin-connection is\nKK\n\u03c9(3) = k \u2227 F(2)\n=\n\n1\ndx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 .\nRx2 1\n\n(3.13)\n\nTherefore, explaining the moduli constraints (3.10) and (3.11) directly in the IIA theory\nshould require us to write down a superpotential which has nontrivial dependence on the\nspin-connection, or equivalently, on the corresponding Kaluza-Klein flux. This expectation\nwill be borne out in \u00a74, where we derive the IIA superpotential and show that it can\ncorrectly reproduce the constraints (3.10) and (3.11) in this example.\n\nFinally, we note here that this compactification manifold is non-K\u00e4hler. One way to\nprove this is as follows. As in \u00a72.2, we can use the relationship between the fundamental\n\ngroup and the first homology of the manifold to compute h1 . In this case, h1 = 5, while for\na K\u00e4hler manifold h1 is always even. As we will describe in \u00a74.1, this particular example\ndoes admit an integrable complex structure, so it is a complex but non-K\u00e4hler space.\n12\n\n\fTwo T-Dualities: A IIB Dual\nAgain, dualizing the y 3 coordinate at this stage would not lead to any further interesting twists in the metric. So instead we dualize the y 1 coordinate. The resulting IIB\ngeometry is characterized by the metric\nds2 = R\u0303x2 1 (dx1 + 2x2 dx3 )2 + Rx2 (dx2 )2 + Rx3 (dx3 )2\n1\n+ 2 (dy 1 + 2y 2 dx3 )2 + Ry22 (dy 2 )2 + Ry3 (dy 3 )2 .\nRy 1\n\n(3.14)\n\nAt this stage of the duality, we have reached a state where the B-field on the internal space\nvanishes. However, there is a nontrivial RR three-form flux\nF3 = 2(dx1 + 2x2 dx3 ) \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dy 3 + 2(dy 1 + 2y 2 dx3 ) \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dy 3\n\n(3.15)\n\nIt is simple to T-dualize the moduli constraints (3.3) and (3.4) and one again finds that\nin a suitable regime of moduli space, this twice T-dualized geometry is the most effective\ndescription of the physics. One can again quickly argue that this space is non-K\u00e4hler,\nby writing out the fundamental form J which comes from the metric (3.14). This form\nhas dJ 6= 0. A more complete discussion of this is given in \u00a74.2, where we describe the\nsupersymmetry conditions after two T-dualities.\nThree T-Dualities: The IIA \"Mirror\"\nFinally, one can perform a third T-duality along the y 3 direction. One might call the\nresult a \"mirror\" geometry to our starting point, since mirror symmetry can be understood\nas T-duality along supersymmetric T 3 fibers [22]. The effect of this last duality on the\ngeometry is simply to take the metric from the previous step and flip Ry3 \u2192 1/Ry3 . There\n\nis in addition a nonvanishing F2 flux\n\nF2 = 2(dx1 + 2x2 dx3 ) \u2227 dy 2 + 2(dy 1 + 2y 2 dx3 ) \u2227 dx2 .\n\n(3.16)\n\nAlthough this is a mirror description of the original IIB Calabi-Yau orientifold, the\nresulting metric is not related to a Calabi-Yau metric. The new information is encoded in\nwindings:\n\u2022 The x1 x3 T 2 undergoes an SL(2,Z) monodromy as one goes around the x2 circle.\n\n\u2022 The y 1 x3 T 2 undergoes an SL(2,Z) monodromy as one goes around the y 2 direction.\n\nAltogether, the nontrivial structure of the metric can be encoded in some SL(3,Z)\n\nmatrices that act on the x1 y 1 x3 directions, as one moves around on the base parametrized\n13\n\n\fby x2 y 2 y 3 . It would be very interesting to find such non Calabi-Yau mirrors of (orientifolds\nof) more generic Calabi-Yau manifolds with flux. Note that in the example above we Tdualised along the x1 , y 1 , y 3 direction, so this is the T 3 fibre of mirror symmetry. The\nSL(3, Z) twist then mixes the fibre and base directions of the Calabi-Yau manifold.\nAfter this third T-duality, the moduli constraints become:\nR\u0303y1 Rx2 = R\u0303x1 Ry2\n\n(3.17)\n\nR\u0303y1 R\u0303x1 = gs Rx3\n\n(3.18)\n\nwhere now all variables appearing are the appropriate variables for the final IIA description\n(each R\u0303 is the inverse of the original starting IIA radius, and gs is the final IIA coupling).\nBy choosing an appropriate regime of couplings and radii, one can satisfy these constraints\nwhile making the description after three T-dualities the most effective description.\n3.2. M-theory limit and the web of vacua\nOur final IIA background has the following property.9 By taking the strong-coupling\nlimit of this IIA vacuum one can get an M-theory description where all radii (including\nthat of the 11th dimension) are large in 11d Planck units, consistent with the constraints\n(3.17) and (3.18). But since the IIA background was characterized by only a nontrivial\nmetric and F2 , the M-theory description should be purely geometrical.\nTo obtain 4d N = 2 supersymmetry from M-theory, one should compactify it on a\n\nCalabi-Yau threefold times a circle. Therefore, the 11d limit of this model should yield M-\n\ntheory on some Calabi-Yau threefold X times a circle. From this viewpoint, we have done\na twisted reduction (presumably using a twisted circle in the T 3 -fibers of the Calabi-Yau\nthreefold) to get our IIA model. It may be possible to characterize this threefold more\nconcretely, using facts about the M-theory lift of the D6 branes and O6 planes. Since\nit is known how to write the M-theory lift of O6 planes in terms of the Atiyah-Hitchin\nspace, and how to relate D6 branes to ALE metrics in M-theory [41], the construction\nof the Calabi-Yau X should involve gluing these local features together into a compact\ngeometry. In fact, one can obtain a family of models with different numbers of D6 branes\n(and different twisting) by rescaling the original fluxes. In particular, it is possible to\nrescale the fluxes so that one satisfies the RR tadpole conditions with no D6 branes. The\n9\n\nWe thank P. Berglund and N. Warner for emphasizing this point to us.\n\n14\n\n\fM-theory lift of this model would only involve a gluing of Atiyah-Hitchin spaces (and the\nright twisting of the S 1 to give rise to F2 ) in the M-theory limit. It would be interesting\nto more completely characterize the Calabi-Yau manifolds one gets by lifting this set of\nmodels.\nEven without detailed knowledge of the structure of X, this result is interesting because it implies that the orientifold example we have described here is connected, on the\nmoduli space of vacua, to type IIA compactifications on smooth Calabi-Yau threefolds\n(with no orientifolding). It was already shown in [40] that the model with no fluxes, which\nis just dual to the standard N = 4 supersymmetric compactification of the heterotic string\n\non T 6 , is connected by vacuum bubbles (of very low tension, in appropriate regimes) to the\nother flux vacua on T 6 /Z2 . In particular, our N = 2 model lies on the same configuration\nspace as the heterotic string on T 6 (or type II on K3\u00d7T 2 ), in a meaningful sense. But this,\n\ncombined with our present result, implies that the web of N = 2 type II compactifications\non Calabi-Yau spaces is connected (slightly \"off\" the moduli space) to the N = 4 models,\nand to the N = 1, 2 flux models of [12].\n\nFinally, it should be clear that we have considered this N = 2 model for its simplicity,\n\nand because we are confident that vacua with extended supersymmetry exist as solutions\nto the full theory. However, our considerations could be repeated with many N = 1 flux\n\nvacua (in the approximation that the flux-generated potential is the full potential). In\nsuitable examples, where there is a IIA dual picture involving only F2 flux, one would then\nexpect to find a connection between these flux models and M-theory compactifications on\nmanifolds of G2 holonomy.\n3.3. The example as a coset\nThe example described above can also be characterized simply as a coset, in analogy\nwith the nilmanifold of \u00a72.2. Although we will discuss the procedure which allows us to do\n\nthis in our example, it should be clear that the ideas would generalize to other \"twisted\ntori.\" For simplicity, we will provide the coset description of the 5-manifold Y spanned by\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , y 1 , y 2 ) in (3.14) (the y 3 direction is just an extra circle in the geometry), with\nall radii set to 1.\nA convenient basis of invariant one-forms on Y is provided by\n\u03b7 1 = dx1 + 2x2 dx3 ,\n\n\u03b7 2 = dx2 ,\n\n\u03b7 4 = dy 1 + 2y 2 dx3 ,\n\n\u03b7 5 = dy 2 .\n15\n\n\u03b7 3 = dx3 ,\n\n(3.19)\n\n\fThese satisfy an equation of the form\n1 i j\n\u03b7 \u2227 \u03b7k ,\nd\u03b7 i = \u2212 fjk\n2\n\n(3.20)\n\nwhere f is antisymmetric on its two lower indices. The only non-vanishing components of\nf in this case are\n1\n1\nf32\n= \u2212f23\n= 2,\n\n4\n4\nf35\n= \u2212f53\n= 2.\n\n(3.21)\n\ni\nGiven such \"structure constants\" fjk\n, we can naturally write down a Lie algebra with\n\ngenerators Ei , satisfying the commutation relations:\ni\n[Ej , Ek ] = fjk\nEi .\n\n(3.22)\n\nA simple matrix representation of generators satisfying these relations can be written down\nas follows. Define the matrices E\u03b1\u03b2 which have only one nonzero entry:\n(E\u03b1\u03b2 )ij = \u03b4\u03b1,i \u03b4\u03b2,j .\n\n(3.23)\n\nThen a representation of the algebra (3.22) with structure constants (3.21) is given by\nchoosing\nE1 = 2E24 , E2 = 2E23 , E3 = \u22122E34 , E4 = 2E14 , E5 = 2E13 .\n\n(3.24)\n\nIt is easy to check that these generators have the property that at the quadratic level,\nall products vanish except\nE2 E3 = \u22122E1 , E5 E3 = \u22122E4 .\n\n(3.25)\n\nTherefore, when we exponentiate the Lie algebra to form a group G, we find that one can\nwrite the generic group element as\ng = 1 + x1 E 1 + x2 E 2 + x3 E 3 + y 1 E 4 + y 2 E 5\n\n(3.26)\n\nHere 1 is the unit matrix and the xs and ys are real numbers. We can also define a group\nG(Z), as the group whose elements can be written as\nh=1+\n\n5\nX\ni=1\n\nwith ni \u2208 Z.\n16\n\nni E i\n\n(3.27)\n\n\fNow, consider identifying points in G under left-multiplication by elements of G(Z).\nOne sees that\n(1 + ni Ei )(1 + x1 E1 + x2 E2 + x3 E3 + y1 E4 + y2 E5 ) =\n1 + E1 (n1 + x1 \u2212 2n2 x3 ) + E2 (n2 + x2 ) + E3 (n3 + x3 ) + E4 (n4 + y1 \u2212 2n5 x3 ) + E5 (n5 + y2 ).\n(3.28)\nTherefore, the identifications generated by the G(Z) action are precisely those which are\ncharacteristic of the twisted geometry with metric (3.14). In particular, the twisted identifications\n(x1 , x2 , x3 , y 1 , y 2 ) \u223c (x1 \u2212 2x3 , x2 + 1, x3 , y 1 , y 2 ) \u223c (x1 , x2 , x3 , y 1 \u2212 2x3 , y 2 + 1)\n\n(3.29)\n\nare reproduced by (3.28).\nThe structure described here generalizes to the full set of T-duals of flux vacua on\nT 6 /Z2 . The invariant one-forms in the twisted picture always define structure constants\nvia an equation of the form (3.20). These structure constants can be used to define a Lie\nalgebra and a corresponding Lie group G, which admits a simple representation in terms\nof upper triangular matrices. The resulting generalized nilmanifold geometry is a coset of\nG by the appropriate discrete subgroup.\n\n4. Supersymmetry\nIn this section we analyse the spinor conditions and determine the requirements imposed by N = 1 supersymmetry in the various T-dual descriptions. Starting from the IIB\nbackgrounds in the class described in \u00a72.1, we characterize the theories obtained after one\nT-duality in \u00a74.1 and those obtained after two T-dualities in \u00a74.2. The supersymmetry\n\nrequirements will also fix the superpotential (the analogue of (2.4)) in the dual theories,\nas is discussed in \u00a74.3.\nOur approach is straightforward. In the starting IIB theory the neccessary and sufficient conditions for susy in the presence of flux are well know [42,11], and were summarized\nin \u00a72.1. We use the known rules of T-duality [43,44], summarized in Apps. A and B, to\n\nmap these conditions to the dual theories. This yields the required conditions for susy in\nthe dual variables.\n17\n\n\f4.1. IIA with O4 Planes\nWe start with the IIB theory with O3 planes. In the discussion below, we will follow the\nnotation of [42] closely, see also [12]. We consider the conditions imposed by supersymmetry\non the metric and flux in the original IIB theory, and map them to conditions in the IIA\ntheory.\nThe supersymmetry conditions:\nOur notation is as follows. We denote the direction along which T-duality is carried\nout as x. \u03bc, \u03bd refer to coordinate indices along all six internal directions, while \u03b1, \u03b2 refer to\ncoordinate indices along the five internal directions, not including x. Finally, a, b denote\nthe six tangent space indices. One more comment before we get started. Unlike much of\nthe rest of this paper, we include the warp factor in this subsection.\nSupersymmetry requires that metric of the starting IIB theory is conformally CY3\n(more generally it is a manifold with reduced holonomy, in our case T 6 ).10 Up to the warp\nfactor it is therefore complex and K\u00e4hler. Let\n\u01eb\u0303 = \u01eb\u0303L + i\u01eb\u0303R\n\n(4.1)\n\ndenote the spinor in the IIB theory which meets the requirements of supersymmetry.\nAs discussed in [11,42], \u01eb\u0303 is of B-type and therefore has definite SO(6) chirality. An\nalmost complex structure (ACS) can then be defined by\nJba = \u01eb\u0303\u2020 [\u03b3 a , \u03b3b ]\u01eb\u0303\n\n(4.2)\n\n(we take \u01eb\u0303 to be appropriately normalised so that J 2 = \u22121). For T 6 /Z2 the spinor \u01eb\u0303 is a\n\nconstant independent of the internal coordinates, and it is easy to see that the Nijenhuis\ntensor vanishes. As a result the ACS (4.2) is integrable.\nNow we turn to the metric in the IIA theory obtained by one T-duality. We denote\n\nthe direction along which the T-duality is carried out as x. We start with the metric on\nthe T 6 /Z2 in IIB\nds2 = e2A j\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd ,\nwhere j\u03bc\u03bd is constant and A is the warp factor. There is also a B field:\n\n(4.3)\n11\n\n[B2 ]x\u03b1 = [H3 ]x\u03b1\u03b2 x\u03b2 .\n10\n\nHere we only consider compactifications where the dilaton is a constant.\n\n11\n\nOther components of the B field do not enter in determining the dual metric.\n\n18\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fWe find after using the rules for T-duality, App. A, that the resulting metric in IIA can\nbe written as\n2\n\n\u22122A\n\nds = e\n\n1\njxx\n\n2A\n\nx x\n\n\u03b7 \u03b7 +e\n\n\u0012\n\nj\u03b1x j\u03b2x\nj\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\njxx\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b7\u03b1 \u03b7\u03b2 .\n\n(4.5)\n\n\b\nHere, \u03b7 x , \u03b7 \u03b1 , \u03b1 = 2, . . . , 6, is a basis of one-forms defined by\n\u03b7 x = dx \u2212 Bx\u03b1 dx\u03b1\n\n(4.6)\n\nand\n\u03b7 \u03b1 = dx\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03b1 = 2, . . . , 6.\n\n(4.7)\n\nUsing Bx\u03b1 = \u2212gx\u03b1 /gxx (from App. A), we can equivalently write (4.6) as\ngxx \u03b7 x = k(x) \u2261 gx\u03bc dx\u03bc .\n\n(4.8)\n\nThe quantitity k(x) in Eq. (4.8) is the Killing one-form. It is one-form that is dual to\nthe Killing vector \u2202x , which generates translations in the x-direction. (In components,\n\u03bc\n= \u03b4x\u03bc , so k(x)\u03bc = gx\u03bc ).\nk(x)\n\nA nowhere vanishing, globally well-defined vielbein field, \u03b7\u0302 a , a = 1, . . . , 6, can be\ndefined in terms of the \u03b7 x , \u03b7 \u03b1 by diagonalizing the metric (4.5). This is in accord with \u00a72.3\n\nwhere we had discussed that twisted tori are in general parallelizable manifolds.\n\nNext we turn to the spinor analysis. The spinor transformations rules under T-duality\nshow, generally, that if \u01eb\u0303 (4.1) meets the spinor conditions for susy in IIB, then the spinor\n\u01eb = \u01ebL + i\u01ebR\n\n(4.9)\n\nmeets the required conditions in the IIA theory. Here \u01eb is defined in terms of the IIB spinor\nas follows:\n\u01eb\u0303L = \u03a9\u01ebL , \u01eb\u0303R = \u01ebR .\n\n(4.10)\n\n\u03a9 is defined in App. B.\nConsider now the following definition of an ACS in the IIA case. It is given by the\nsame matrix Jba defined in (4.2), but with the indices a, b taking values in the \u03b7\u0302 a tangent\nspace basis (defined after (4.7)) of the dual manifold. Expressed in terms of the IIA spniors\nthe almost complex structure takes the form:\n\u2020\n\nJba = (\u03a9\u01ebL + i\u01ebR ) [\u03b3 a , \u03b3b ] (\u03a9\u01ebL + i\u01ebR ) .\n19\n\n(4.11)\n\n\fIt is useful to understand this ACS in the basis of one-forms defined in (4.6), (4.7).\nGroup the \u03b7 x , \u03b7 \u03b1 into two sets, \u03b7 1 = \u03b7 x , \u03b7 2 , \u03b7 3 and \u03b7 4 , \u03b7 5 , \u03b7 6 . Then define holomorphic one\nforms as\ni\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 i + \u03c4ji \u03b7 3+j , i, j = 1, * * * 3.\n\n(4.12)\n\nThis choice of holomorphic one forms defines an almost complex structure (ACS)\nparametrized by the matrix \u03c4ji . The reader will notice that the above steps are analogous to parametrizing the complex structure for a torus. Keeping that analogy in mind\nwe will refer to \u03c4ji as the period matrix of the twisted torus below. Since the spinor \u01eb\u0303 (4.1)\nis a constant, the ACS defined in (4.11) is a member of this family, and corresponds to a\nparticular choice of the matrix \u03c4ji .\nIn the basis of holomorphic one-forms the metric (4.5) can be written as\ni \uf6be\u0304\nds2 = gi\uf6be\u0304 \u03b7H\n\u03b7\u0304H ,\n\n(4.13)\n\nwhere gi\uf6be\u0304 can be easily obtained in terms of the IIA metric (4.5). This shows that the\nmetric is Hermitian with respect to the ACS (4.11). We can now define a two-form, called\nthe fundamental two-form,\n\uf6be\u0304\ni\n.\nJIIA = igi\uf6be\u0304 \u03b7H\n\u2227 \u03b7\u0304H\n\n(4.14)\n\nWe will see towards the end of this section that the ACS defined above is not integrable.\nOne can also show that the fundamental two-form, (4.14), is not closed\n\n12\n\n. This implies\n\nthat the dual geometry is not K\u00e4hler. We will see below that an integrable ACS can be\ndefined in the IIA theory, but even with this choice, the fundamental two-form is not closed\nand the manifold is not K\u00e4hler. This is in agreement with our discussion of the specific\nexample in \u00a73.1, where we showed that the first homology group of the dual manifold is\n\nodd dimensional.\n\nThe main motivation for considering the ACS above is that the resulting susy conditions on the flux are easy to state, as we shall now see. Consider first the requirements\nimposed by susy on the flux in the IIB theory. These are that the G3 flux should be of\ntype (2, 1) and primitive, as reviewed in \u00a72.1. We now map these conditions to the IIA\nside.\n12\n\n1\n= d\u03b7 x 6= 0. Another term arises because gi\uf6be\u0304\nFor example, one term in dJ arises from, d\u03b7H\n\ndepends on the warp factor, A, (4.3).\n\n20\n\n\fAs discussed in App. B, the flux G3 maps on the IIA side to the three-form\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u221a\nGIIA = F\u03034(x) + gxx \u03b7 x \u2227 F2 \u2212 i gxx /gsIIA H3 \u2212 gxx \u03b7 x \u2227 \u03c9(x) .\n\n(4.15)\n\nEq. (4.15) is based notation that is also introduced in App. B, we will comment more on\nthe various terms that appear in it below.\nWith the choice of ACS specified above in (4.11) and (4.9), it then follows, as we\nillustrate in App. B, that the (2, 1) and primitivity conditions map to two requirements on\nthe IIA side. First, that GIIA is of type (2, 1) with respect to the ACS (4.11), (4.9). And\nsecond, that it satisfies the condition:\nJIIA \u2227 GIIA = 0,\n\n(4.16)\n\nwhere JIIA is the fundamental two-form (4.14) in the IIA theory. We will refer to (4.16) as\nthe primitivity condition, since it is analogous to the corresponding condition in the IIB\ntheory.\nBefore going further let us discuss the various terms in (4.15) in more detail. These\narise from the flux G3 , (2.5), after T-duality. F\u03034(x) in (4.15), stands for the gauge invariant\nfour-form in IIA with one leg along the x direction. It arises from F3 in the IIB theory with\nno leg in the x direction. Similarly, F2 and H3 denote the two form and NS three form in\nIIA, these terms arise from F3 with a leg along the x direction and from H3 without a leg\n\u221a\nalong the x direction respectively. The quantity gxx /gsIIA is simply the dilaton in the IIB\ntheory. Finally, the last term in (4.15), arise by T-duality from H3 with a leg along the\n\nx direction. The quantity k(x) = gxx \u03b7 x is the Killing one-form (4.8) associated with the\n\nisometry in the x-direction, and \u2212\u03c9(x) is the corresponding Kaluza-Klein field-strength.\n\nTogether, \u2212gxx \u03b7 x \u2227\u03c9(x) is the antisymmetrised spin-connection three-form \u03c9(3) ,13 in accord\n\nwith our discussion in section 2, (2.20).\n\nIt is also worth commenting that from a IIA perspective, forgetting about the original\nIIB description, the direction x is singled out in (4.15) (and in the IIA superpotential)\nbecause the O4 planes extend along it.\nBelow we comment in more detail on the ACS defined above in the susy analysis. In\n\u00a74.3, we discuss how to formulate a superpotential in the IIA theory which implements the\n(2, 1) condition on the flux, GIIA .\n13\n\nAll other components of the antisymmetrized spin-connection are required to vanish by the\n\norientifold projection.\n\n21\n\n\fThe ACS in more detail\nIt is clear that the ACS defined in the IIA theory above, (4.11), bears a close relation\nto the complex structure in the starting IIB theory, (4.2). However, in the IIA theory, due\nto the non-trivially twisted torus, the ACS is not integrable, in general. The condition\nfor integrability [45] is easy to state in terms of the structure constants which specify\nthe twist, (2.24). In the holomorphic basis (4.12) (with i, \u0131\u0304 denoting holomorphic and\nantiholomorphic indices respectively), it takes the form:\n\u0131\u0304\nf\uf6be\u0304ik\u0304 = fjk\n= 0.\n\n(4.17)\n\nThe lack of integrability is perhaps best illustrated with an example. Consider the\nexample of one T-duality discussed in \u00a73.1. We start in the IIB theory at a point in moduli\n\nspace where the T 6 is of the form (T 2 )3 , with the modular parameters of the three T 2 s being\npurely imaginary, of the form \u03c4i = iRyi /Rxi . The three holomorphic differentials then are\n\ndz i = dxi + \u03c4i dy i . For simplicity we also take the metric to be of form: ds2 = dz i dz\u0304 \u0131\u0304 .\nIn the IIA dual theory the resulting ACS (4.11) corresponds to the choice of the period\nmatrix \u03c4ji , (4.12), of the form\n\u03c4ji = diag(\u03c41 , \u03c42 , \u03c43 ).\n\n(4.18)\n\nThe three holomorphic one forms are then given by\n1\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 x + \u03c41 \u03b7 4 ,\n\n2\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 2 + \u03c42 \u03b7 5 ,\n\n3\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 3 + \u03c43 \u03b7 6 .\n\n(4.19)\n\nWe will skip some of the details here, but this can be established by using the matrix Q\u03bc\u03bd\ndefined in App. B, to relate the vielbein \u03b7\u0302 a , which appears in (4.11), to the basis (4.6),\n(4.7), which in turn is related to the holomorphic one forms in (4.12).\nTo test for integrability, we consider\n1\nd\u03b7H\n= d\u03b7 x = \u03b7 2 \u2227 \u03b7 3 .\n\n(4.20)\n\nExpressing the RHS in terms of the holomorphic basis (4.19), one sees that f2\u030413\u0304 6= 0, so\n(4.17) is not met\n\n14\n\n.\n\nWe have not explored in general whether an integrable ACS can be defined in the dual\nmodel. For the example considered above the answer turns out to be yes. E.g., consider\nan alternate choice of holomorphic one forms\n1\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 1 + \u03c41 \u03b7 4 ,\n\n2\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 2 + \u03c42 \u03b7 3 ,\n\n3\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 5 + \u03c43 \u03b7 6 .\n\n(4.21)\n\n1\n2\n2\nThen one can show that d\u03b7H\n\u223c \u03b7H\n\u2227 \u03b7\u0304H\n, so (4.17) is now met.\n14\n\nWe have neglected the effects of warping here. Incorporating them does not change the\n1\n1\n1\nhas an additional term.\n= e\u2212A \u03b7 x + \u03c41 eA \u03b7 4 , so that d\u03b7H\nis now given by \u03b7H\nconclusions. \u03b7H\n\n22\n\n\f4.2. IIB with O5 Planes\nWe turn next to the model obtained by two T-dualities. Since the analysis is very\nsimilar to the one T-duality case, we will be brief below\n\n15\n\n. The two directions along\n\nwhich T-duality is done are denoted by x, y. Using the rules in App. A the metric after\ntwo T-dualities can be written as\nds2 = \u0135xx \u03b7 x \u03b7 x + \u0135yy \u03b7 y \u03b7 y + 2\u0135xy \u03b7 x \u03b7 y + \u0135\u03b1\u0302\u03b2\u0302 \u03b7 \u03b1\u0302 \u03b7 \u03b2\u0302 .\n\n(4.22)\n\nHere \u03b7 x , \u03b7 y , \u03b7 \u03b1\u0302 denote a basis of one-forms given by:\n\u03b7 x = dx \u2212 Bx\u03b1\u0302 dx\u03b1\u0302\n\u0011\n\u0135yy \u0010\n= dx +\n\u0135xx \u0135(x) \u2212 \u0135xy \u0135(y) ,\ndetxy \u0135\n\n(4.23)\n\n\u03b7 y = dy \u2212 By\u03b1\u0302 dx\u03b1\u0302\n\u0011\n\u0135xx \u0010\n\u0135yy \u0135(y) \u2212 \u0135xy \u0135(x) ,\n= dy +\ndetxy \u0135\n\n(4.24)\n\n\u03b7 \u03b1\u0302 = dx\u03b1\u0302 .\n\n(4.25)\n\nand\n\nThe notation used above is as follows.

(4.8) is\n\u0135xx \u03b7 x + \u0135xy \u03b7 y = k\u0302(x) \u2261 \u0135x\u03bc dx\u03bc ,\n\u0135yx \u03b7 x + \u0135yy \u03b7 y = k\u0302(y) \u2261 \u0135y\u03bc dx\u03bc .\n\n(4.26)\n\nHere, k\u0302(x) and k\u0302(y) are the Killing one-forms that are dual to the Killing vectors \u2202x and \u2202y ,\nwhich generate translations in the x- and y-directions, respectively. (The determinants in\nthe definition of \u03b7 x ,\u03b7 y cancel out in the linear combinations on the LHS of (4.26), leaving\nthe RHS).\nOnce again we define an ACS in the T-dual theory, in terms of the spinor \u02c6\u01eb\u0303. In a\nvielbein basis \u03b7\u0302 a which is obtained by diagonalising the metric above, it takes the form\n15\n\nWe neglect the warp factor here, this can be included along the lines of the previous section.\n\n23\n\n\f(4.2). Holomorphic one forms analogous to (4.12) can now be defined, and the metric (4.22)\ncan be written in the form (4.13) in this basis. This allows us to define a fundamental\ntwo-form. It takes the form:\n\uf6be\u0304\ni\n.\nJ\u02c6 = i \u0135i\uf6be\u0304 \u03b7H\n\u2227 \u03b7H\n\n(4.27)\n\nAs discussed in App. B, the G3 flux of the starting IIB theory now maps to a three\nform\nn\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\no\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nx\ny\nx\ny\nx\ny\n\u011c3 = F\u0303\n+\n\u2227\nF\u0303\n\u2212\n\u0135\n\u03b7\n+\n\u0135\n\u03b7\n\u2227\nF\u0303\n+\ndet\n\u0135\n\u03b7\n\u2227\n\u03b7\n\u2227\nF\u0302\n\u0135\n\u03b7\n+\n\u0135\n\u03b7\nxx\nxy\nxy\n1\nxy\nyy\n5(yx)\n3(y)\n3(x)\nq\no\nn\n\u0001\n\u2212 i/\u011dsIIB detxy \u0135 \u01243 + \u0135xx \u03b7 x \u2227 d\u0135(x) + \u0135yy \u03b7 y \u2227 d\u0135(y) .\n(4.28)\nOur notation is defined in App. B. Supersymmetry then leads to the conditions that \u011c3\nis of type (2, 1) (with reference to the ACS defined above) and primitive (with respect to\nthe fundamental form (4.27)).\nLet us comment briefly on the various terms in (4.28). These arise from G3 , (2.5),\n\u02c6\nin the starting IIB theory after T-duality. F\u0303\n5(yx) , arises from F\u03033 with no leg along the\n\u02c6\n\u02c6\nx, y directions, F\u0303\n, F\u0303\n, from F\u0303 with a leg along either y or x direction and F\u0302 from\n3(x)\n\n3\n\n3(y)\n\nF\u03033 with a leg along both x, y directions. \u01243 arises from H3 with no leg along the x, y\n\ndirections. Finally, the last two terms in (4.28), are components of the antisymmetrised\nspin connection in the dual theory. They arise from H3 with one leg along the x or y\n\ndirections. In this context it is worth noting that the last two terms in (4.28) can be\nrewritten as:\n\u0135xx \u03b7 x \u2227 d\u0135(x) + \u0135yy \u03b7 y \u2227 d\u0135(y) = k\u0302(x) \u2227 F x + k\u0302(y) \u2227 F y ,\n\n(4.29)\n\nwhere k\u0302(x,y) are the Killing one forms defined in (4.26) and F x,y are the field strengths of\nthe associated KK gauge fields\n\n16\n\n.\n\nMore on the ACS in the two T-duality case\nBefore proceeding let us discuss the ACS defined in the dual IIB theory in more detail.\nIn general for the case after two T-dualities we find that the ACS is not integrable. Let\nus illustrate this lack of integrability with the example discussed in section 3.1, which was\nalso used in the discussion of the ACS in the one T-duality case, (4.17) onwards, above.\n16\n\nAx\u03bc\n\nThis follows from the standard relation between the KK gauge potential and the metric,\n= \u0135\u03bc\u03b1 \u0135 \u03b1x , \u03b1 = x, y, and similarly for Ay\u03bc .\n\n24\n\n\fStarting in the IIB theory with a metric of form ds2 = dz i dz\u0304 \u012b , we now T-dualize along\nboth x1 , y 1 . The three holomorphic forms are then given by\n1\n2\n3\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b7 x + \u03c4 1 \u03b7 y , \u03b7H\n= \u03b7 2 + \u03c4 2 \u03b7 5 , \u03b7H\n= \u03b73 + \u03c4 3 \u03b76 .\n\n(4.30)\n\n1\nNow considering d\u03b7H\nwe find that (4.17) is not met, except at special points in moduli\n\nspace where \u03c4 1 = \u03c4 2 . Note, this is different from the constraint in moduli space imposed\nby supersymmetry, (3.4), except at the special point \u03c4 1 = \u03c4 2 = i. Thus, generically, we\nsee that the ACS is not integrable.\nOne finds that an alternative ACS can be defined which is integrable in this example.\n1\n3\nIt corresponds to keeping the definition of the holomorphic one form \u03b7H\n, \u03b7H\nthe same as\n\nin (4.30), but changing\n2\n\u03b7H\n= \u03b72 + \u03c4 1 \u03b75.\n\n(4.31)\n\nNow it is easy to see that the integrability condition (4.17) is met.\nWe have not explored the question of whether an integrable ACS exists in full generality. However, we expect in several cases, obtained for example after two T-dualities, that\nthis is true [46]. If \u01eb\u0302 is the spinor in the dual IIB theory that meets the susy conditions,\nwe write\n\u01eb\u0302 = \u01eb\u0302+ + \u01eb\u0302\u2212\n\n(4.32)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u0302\u00b1 are spinors of definite SO(6) chirality 17 . An alternate ACS can then be defined,\nusing \u01eb\u0302+ , of the form\nJba = (\u01eb\u0302+ )\u2020 [\u03b3 a , \u03b3b ](\u01eb\u0302+ )\n\n(4.33)\n\nand similarly, using \u01eb\u0302\u2212 . These alternate ACSs are expected to be integrable in several\ninstances.\nIn the example discussed above for instance, the ACS (4.33) is related to the one used\nin our susy analysis by a rotation in the \u03b7 2 , \u03b7 5 plane by \u03c0/2. This takes \u03c42 \u2192 \u22121/\u03c42 . In\nview of the constraint (3.4), this means that the ACS (4.33) in this example is the same\n\nas the ACS (4.31), which we argued above is integrable. The definition of the ACS (4.33)\nis also analogous to that of Strominger [27] (see also [34]).\n17\n\nNote after two T-dualities the spinor \u01eb\u0302 is not of B-type.\n\n25\n\n\f4.3. Superpotential\nIn this section we will first construct a superpotential in the IIA theory obtained by\none T-duality in \u00a74.1 above, which correctly implements the (2, 1) condition on the flux\n\nGIIA . Next we will verify that in the example of \u00a73.1 the superpotential gives the correct\n\ntensions for various BPS branes in the theory, and the correct constraints on moduli. We\nthen briefly present a similar analysis for the IIB theory obtained after two T-dualities (as\ndescribed in \u00a74.2). Throughout this subsection, we work in the approximation where the\n\nwarp factor (2.7) has been set equal to one.\nOne T-Duality: The IIA Superpotential\n\nOur discussion in this section makes use of the ACS introduced in \u00a74.1 (4.11),(4.12).\n\nThe ACS is parametrized by a period matrix \u03c4ji . One can define a holomorphic (3, 0) form\n(with respect to this ACS), which is given by\n1\n2\n3\n\u03a9 = \u03b7H\n\u2227 \u03b7H\n\u2227 \u03b7H\n.\n\n(4.34)\n\nNote that due to the torus being twisted, \u03a9 is not closed in general.\nThe superpotential which implements the (2, 1) condition for GIIA is given by\nWIIA =\n\nZ\n\nM\n\nGIIA \u2227 \u03a9IIA .\n\n(4.35)\n\nThe argument leading to (4.35) is closely analogous to that in the original IIB theory. We\nbegin by noting that \u03a9 depends on period matrix, \u03c4ji . Varying \u03a9 with repect to \u03c4ji gives us\na basis of nine (1, 2) forms which are well defined on the twisted torus 18 . Thus demanding\nthat\n\u2202WIIA /\u2202\u03c4ji = 0,\nimposes the condition that GIIA has no (1, 2) terms in it\n18\n\n(4.36)\n19\n\n.\n\nBy well-defined we mean that they have the required periodicity properties imposed by the\n\nnon-trivial twists. In general, any form which has constant coefficients when expanded in the \u03b7\nbasis (4.6), (4.7) meets this condition.\n19\n\nWe assume here that to begin with GIIA has constant coefficients in the \u03b7 basis. This is\n\nmanifestly true for the expression (4.15) obtained by T-duality.\n\n26\n\n\fNext, we note that GIIA depends on the field\n\n20\n\n\u221a\n\ngxx /gsIIA . Varying with respect to\n\nit and demanding that WIIA = 0 then sets the (3, 0) and (0, 3) terms of GIIA to vanish,\nyielding the required result that GIIA is of type (2, 1).\nOne more comment is in order. Notice that GIIA has an explicit dependence on the\nmetric component gxx as well (in the terms proportional to F2 etc). However, varying with\nrespect to it does not give any additional constraints.21\nBrane Tensions in the IIA theory\nAs described above, the primitive (2,1) ISD condition can be imposed by a superpoR\ntential G \u2227 \u03a9, supplemented by the condition J \u2227 G = 0. So, we have\nWIIA =\n\nZ\n\nGIIA \u2227 \u03a9IIA ,\n\n(4.37)\n\nwhere GIIA is given by Eq. (4.15). As a check that this is the correct expression, we can\ncompute the tensions of domain walls from wrapped branes, and verify that these tensions\nsatisfy the formula\nTdomain\n\nwall\n\n= a \u2206W = a\n\nZ\n\n\u2206G \u2227 \u03a9 ,\n\n(4.38)\n\nwith the appropriate choice of a.22 For simplicity, we restrict to the case of a T 6 that\nfactorizes into T 2 \u00d7T 2 \u00d7T 2 with respect to both the K\u00e4hler and complex structure moduli:\ndz i = dxi + \u03c4 i dy i ,\nJ=\n\nX\n\n\u03c1i dz i dz \u0131\u0304 ,\n\n\u03c4 i = iRyi /Rxi\n\u03c1i = iRxi Ryi\n\n(no sum),\n(no sum).\n\n(4.39)\n(4.40)\n\nWe also assume that the IIB dilaton-axion has no real (axionic) component. It is convenient\nto define the quantity\n\u03a9\u0303IIB = Rx1 Rx2 Rx3 \u03a9 = (Rx1 dx1 + iRy1 dy 1 ) \u2227 (1 \u2192 2) \u2227 (1 \u2192 3).\n20\n\n(4.41)\n\nThis is in fact the dilaton of the original IIB theory rewriten in the IIA variables. It has a\n\npartner, which in IIA language is A1(x) . Dependence on the partner arises, e.g., from F\u03034 .\n21\n\nThe \u03c4jx components of the period matrix always come multipled by gxx in WIIA .\n\n22\n\nWe will not determine a from first principles here, but it is possible to do so by paying\n\nproper attention to normalization. The tension in Einstein frame is then e\u2212K/2 \u2206W , where K is\nthe K\u00e4hler potential. One then needs to convert to string frame to compare to the results of this\nsection.\n\n27\n\n\fThe utility of this definition is that the components of \u03a9\u0303IIB are the powers of i times the\nvolume forms of various three-cycles. In terms of \u03a9\u0303IIB ,\nIIB\nTdomain\nwall\n\n= cIIB\n\nZ\n\n\u2206GIIB \u2227 \u03a9\u0303IIB ,\n\ncIIB = aIIB /(Rx1 Rx2 Rx3 ).\n\n(4.42)\n\nSimilarly, in the dual IIA theory obtained by T-dualizing in the x-direction, it is convenient\nto define an analogous quantity \u03a9\u0303IIA , obtained from (4.41) by replacing Rx dx with Rx\u22121 \u03b7 x .\nWe then obtain a IIA expression for the domain wall tension, of the same form as (4.42).\nThe IIA and IIB expressions for the tension must be equal.\nConsider first a D5-brane that wraps a three-cycle \u03b33 of T 6 on IIB side. Then,\nas we pass through the resulting domain wall in R3,1 , we have \u2206GIIB = \u2206F3 , where\nF3 /(2\u03ba210 \u03bcD5 ) is in the cohomology class Poincar\u00e9 dual to \u03b33 . Consequently,\ncIIB\n\nZ\n\n\u2206GIIB \u2227 \u03a9\u0303IIB =\n\ncIIB 2\u03ba210 \u03bcD5\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\u0303IIB =\n\u03b33\n\ncIIB (2\u03ba210 gsIIB )\u03c4D5\n\nZ\n\n\u03a9\u0303IIB .\n\n(4.43)\n\n\u03b33\n\nEqs. (4.42) and (4.43) correctly give the tension of the domain wall if\n1/cIIB = 2\u03ba210 gsIIB ,\n\n(4.44)\n\nand if the pullback of \u03a9\u0303IIB to \u03b33 is a phase factor times the volume form. It is easy to see\nfrom the explicit form of \u03a9\u0303 (4.41), that if the latter is true, then\n\u03a9\u0303IIA \u2227 Rx\u22121 \u03b7 x = ei\u03b1 Vol(\u03b34 )\nRx \u03a9\u0303IIA\n\n\u0001\n\n1\ndxi\nxij 2\n\n(\u03b34 wrapped by T-dual D6) D5 \u22a5 x,\n\n\u2227 dxj = ei\u03b1 Vol(\u03b32 )\n\n(\u03b32 wrapped by T-dual D4) D5 k x,\n\n(4.45)\n(4.46)\n\nwhere ei\u03b1 is a phase factor and Vol(\u03b3) denotes the volume form on \u03b3. In these two cases\nwe also have\n1\ngx[i Fjk] 3!\ndxi \u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk = Rx\u22122 \u03b7 x \u2227 F(2) ,\n\nFxijk \u03b7 x \u2227\n\ni\n1\n3! dx\n\n\u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk = F(4) ,\n\n(4.47)\n(4.48)\n\nrespectively, so that GIIA \u2227 \u03a9\u0303IIA = Rx\u22121 F(2) \u2227 Vol(\u03b34 ) in the first case, and GIIA \u2227 \u03a9\u0303IIA =\nRx\u22121 F(4) \u2227 Vol(\u03b32 ) in the second.

(4.53) and (4.54) together give cIIA = cIIB Rx2 , which agrees with Eqs. (4.51) and\n\u0001\n(4.44). The carrier of \u03c9(3) ijx charge is a Kaluza-Klein monopole, which can be regarded\n\nas a KK5-brane, or twisted 6-brane [26].\n\nModuli constraints from the IIA superpotential\nIn the example considered in \u00a73.1 it is possible to directly derive the constraints\n\non moduli (3.10) and (3.11) which apply in the T-dual IIA description, by computing\nand stationarizing the superpotential (4.37). Direct calculation of GIIA (4.15) using the\nformulae in App. A yields\n1\nGIIA = dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dy 3 + R\u0303x2 1 (dx1 + x2 dx3 ) \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dy 3\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\n\u2212 i/gsIIA R\u0303x1 dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2227 dx3 + R\u0303x2 1 dx1 \u2227 dx2 \u2227 dx3 .\n29\n\n(4.55)\n\n\fSo one finds that WIIA is\n\u0001\n1\nWIIA = 1 + \u03c11 \u03c4 2 + R\u0303x1 /gsIIA (\u03c4 3 + \u03c11 \u03c4 2 \u03c4 3 ) .\n2\n\n(4.56)\n\nHere the \u03c1 and \u03c4 moduli are being defined as in a conventional square six-torus, so e.g.\n\u03c11 = iR\u0303x1 Ry1 and so forth.23\nAs an aside, we should note that it is not surprising that 1/gsIIA appears in the\nsuperpotential together with a factor of the IIA radius R\u0303x1 . The 10d IIB axio-dilaton\n\u03c6 is a complex scalar, and can appear in a 4d N = 1 chiral multiplet, and hence in a\n\nsuperpotential. In contrast, the 10d IIA dilaton is a real scalar, and first becomes part\n\nof a complex scalar in 9d; and the combination that appears in WIIA is precisely (by Tduality) the IIB dilaton \u03c6. This is the field that appears as part of a chiral multiplet in\nthe low-energy 4d supersymmetric theory.\nAt this point, we see immediately that the constraints on moduli that we will find\nfrom varying (4.56) will agree with the results (3.10) and (3.11) that follow by dualizing\nthe original IIB constraints. This is because (4.56) precisely agrees (up to the change of\nnotation from IIB to IIA variables) with the original IIB superpotential.\nSuperpotential after Two T-Dualities\nAfter two T-dualities, the superpotential is\nZ\n\u0174IIB = \u011c3 \u2227 \u03a9\u0302IIB ,\n\n(4.57)\n\nwhere \u011c3 is given by Eq. (4.28). An argument similar to that of \u00a74.3 shows that it correctly\n\nimplements the (2, 1) condition on the flux, \u011c3 . A similar identification of domain wall\ntensions can be performed again in this case. The terms in \u011c3 and the corresponding\ndomain walls are summarized in the following table:\nTerm in \u011c3\n\nDomain Wall\n\nF5(yx)\nk(x) \u2227 F3(y)\nk(y) \u2227 F3(x)\n\u0001\ndetxy \u0135 \u03b7 x \u2227 \u03b7 y \u2227 F1\n\u01243\n\u0135xx \u03b7 x \u2227 d\u0135(x)\n\u0135yy \u03b7 y \u2227 d\u0135(y)\n\nD3-brane transverse to x and y\nD5-brane wrapped on x, transverse to y\nD5-brane wrapped on y, transverse to x\nD7-brane wrapped on x and y\nNS5-brane wrapped on x and y\nKK5-brane transverse to x\nKK5-brane transverse to y\n\n23\n\nAs a reminder, R\u0303x1 is the radius of the x1 circle in the IIA theory. The other radii are the\nsame as in the original IIB theory and are denoted without tildes.\n\n30\n\n\f5. Discussion\nThe main lesson we can draw from this paper is that new solutions of the string\nequations of motion based on non Calabi-Yau geometries exist. These can provide supersymmetric vacua after suitable flux is turned on. While we have concentrated on the type\nII theories in this paper, it is clear (for example by duality, as in [34]) that similar constructions exist in the heterotic theory. Moreover, in the simplest examples described in this\npaper, we can construct a superpotential sensitive to this departure from \"Calabi-Yauness.\"\nIt would be very interesting to characterize properly in mathematical terms what the class\nof such compactifications is, and discover how to most efficiently parametrize their moduli\nspaces and superpotentials. Other recent work in this direction has appeared in [32,33].\nThere are also several connections of our new vacua with other backgrounds. As we\nsaw in \u00a73, in some cases, we expect our models to have a lift to an M-theory compactifi-\n\ncation on a manifold of special holonomy. It would be very interesting to find examples\nwhere the M-theory Calabi-Yau (for N = 2) or G2 (for N = 1) geometry could be specified\n\nmore explicitly. Perhaps one can go further towards determining the Calabi-Yau X which\n\nappeared in \u00a73.1 by gluing together Atiyah-Hitchin and ALE metrics.\n\nAnother connection arises by using the duality explored by Hull in [47]. There, it\n\nis argued that M-theory on the nilmanifold is dual to the massive type IIA theory. It\nfollows from this that type IIA theory compactified on the nilmanifold should be dual\nto appropriate compactifications of the massive IIA theory. But we have seen in \u00a73.1\nthat compactifications of the IIA theory on the nilmanifold (and an additional transverse\nT 3 ), with appropriate orientifold actions and background fluxes, yield supersymmetric\nvacua. This implies that the massive IIA theory, which has no ground state with unbroken\nsupersymmetry in ten dimensions, does have vacua with unbroken supersymmetry in lower\ndimensions.\nThere are many clear directions for future work along the lines of this paper:\n\u2022 We have written down examples of novel geometries which arise by dualizing known\n\nvacua. However, the superpotential formulae of \u00a74 can be applied directly to find super-\n\nsymmetric vacua. It would be interesting to exhibit a vacuum which is not related by\nduality to a compactification on a Calabi-Yau orientifold or G2 space in any controlled\n\nlimit.\n\u2022 Our construction started from the T 6 /Z2 orientifold, and the simplicity of T 6 is what is\n\nresponsible for the simple nature of our dual metrics and superpotential formulae. However,\n31\n\n\fit is clear that starting from a more general Calabi-Yau, one could still try to T-dualize\nalong the T 3 fibers [22]. As long as H does not have any components with more than one\nleg along the fibers, this should yield a sensible dual geometry. It would be worthwhile to\nexplore the geometries that arise in this way. Some steps in this direction have been taken\nin the recent papers [32,33].\n\u2022 The detailed structure of the moduli spaces of these new compactifications are somewhat\n\nmysterious. In the large volume limit, the moduli space should have a description in\ngeometrical terms (analogous to the description of Calabi-Yau moduli space which follows\nfrom Yau's theorem). It would be nice to work out an intrinsic formulation of this moduli\nproblem in terms of large radius geometry. In the examples of this paper, and possibly\nmore generally, it could be that the correct procedure is to view all of these vacua as being\nspecified by: i) a choice of Calabi-Yau manifold M , ii) a choice of background NS and\nRR fluxes on M , iii) a choice of background \"KK monopole flux\" or \"twisting\" on M (in\nthe examples at hand, this corresponds to the choice of twisting in the nilmanifold). One\nthen stationarizes the superpotential (which now contains a contribution from the twisting\niii)), and obtains in this way constraints on the \"formerly Calabi-Yau\" moduli. However\nthis prescription, in addition to being vague, depends on various conjectures (about the\nexistence of metrics with appropriate windings iii) given the Calabi-Yau metric on M , for\ninstance) which are not obviously true.\n\u2022 We have seen in this paper that compactifications with flux, after T-duality, turn into\n\ntwisted tori. The twisting gives rise to a non-compact group and the twisted torus can be\nviewed as a coset of this non-compact group. In the examples studied here these turn out\nto be generalizations of the nilmanifold. This raises the natural question of whether all\nScherk-Schwarz compactifications can be understood in this way as cosets. More generally,\nthe connection between flux, twisted tori and cosets (or orbifolds) needs to be understood\nbetter, building on the recent work in [35].\n\u2022 Finally, it would be nice to see if the new compactifications and computable potentials\ndescribed here can, together with other ingredients (notable possibilities are D-brane instanton effects and gaugino condensates), lead to models of interest in string cosmology. A\ndiscussion of the cosmology arising from IIB Calabi-Yau orientifolds with three-form flux\nrecently appeared in [23], the conclusion being that the potentials obtained to date are too\nsteep to serve a useful role in models of inflation or quintessence.\n32\n\n\fAppendix A. T-duality maps of fields\nIn this appendix we express the T-duality maps from IIA to IIB and vice versa. We\nbegin by first explaining our conventions and notation. We will mainly use the conventions\nof Polchinski [48] for the supergravity fields (with the same normalisations). In particular,\n1\n1\nF\u03034 = dC3 + A1 \u2227 H3 , F\u03035 = dC4 \u2212 C2 \u2227 H3 + B2 \u2227 F3 ,\n2\n2\n\n(A.1)\n\nstand for the gauge invariant RR 4-form and 5-form field strengths in the IIA and IIB\ntheories. Also we will use the notation\nF\u03033 = F3 \u2212 C0 H3 ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nin the IIB theory.\nWe also remind the reader of some of our notation. x denotes the direction along which\nwe T-dualise. \u03bc, \u03bd denote corrdinate indices and take six values, \u03b1, \u03b2 denote all coordinate\nindices except x and take five values. Finally, a, b, denote tangent space indices.\nTo save clutter we denote the metric as j\u03bc\u03bd and g\u03bc\u03bd in the IIB and IIA theories\nrespectively. We also denote the NS two form potential and field strengths as B, H3 and\nB, H3 in the IIB and IIA theories respectively.\nGiven an n form Fn we use the notation Fn(x) to denote an n \u2212 1 form whose components are given by:\n[Fn(x) ]i1 ,***in\u22121 = [Fn ]xi1 ***in\u22121 .\n\n(A.3)\n\nFinally\nj(x) =\n\n1\njxx\n\njx\u03b1 dx\u03b1 , g(x) =\n\n1\ngx\u03b1 dx\u03b1\ngxx\n\n(A.4)\n\ndenote one forms in IIB and IIA theory and\n\u03c9(x) = \u2212dg(x) ,\ndenotes a two form in IIA theory.\n33\n\n(A.5)\n\n\fWith these definitions, the map between IIA, and IIB theory under T-duality in the\nx-direction is given as follows [43,44]: The Neveu-Schwarz fields transform as\n\ngxx =\ngx\u03b1\n\n1\n\njxx\nBx\u03b1\n=\u2212\njxx\n\ng\u03b1\u03b2 = j\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\nBx\u03b1 = \u2212\n\n1\njxx\n\n(jx\u03b1 jx\u03b2 \u2212 Bx\u03b1 Bx\u03b2 )\n\njx\u03b1\njxx\n\nB\u03b1\u03b2 = B\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212\n\n1\njxx\n\n(A.6)\n\n(jx\u03b1 Bx\u03b2 \u2212 Bx\u03b1 jx\u03b2 )\n\ng IIB\ngsIIA = \u221as\njxx\n\nHere the left hand refers to fields in the IIA theory and the right hand side to fields in the\nIIB theory.

T-duality map of spinor conditions\nIn this appendix we discuss the T-duality transformation rules for the IIB and IIA\nspinor conditions. Our discussion largely follows [44]. We first discuss the map for Tduality along one direction and then, more briefly, two directions.\nOne T-duality\nWe denote the spinors and vielbein in the IIB (IIA) theory with (without) a tilde\nsuperscript. The vielbein in IIB and IIA theory are related by\n\u1ebd\u03bca = Q\u03bc\u03bd e\u03bda\n\n(B.1)\n\nwhere the matrix Q is given by\nQ=\n\n\u0012\n\ngxx\n0\n35\n\n(g + B)x\u03b1\n1\n\n\u0013\n\n(B.2)\n\n\fGamma matrices with tangent space indices are the same in the IIB and IIA theories,\ni.e.\n\u03b3\u0303 a = \u03b3 a .\n\n(B.3)\n\n\u01eb\u0303 = \u01eb\u0303L + i\u01eb\u0303R ,\n\n(B.4)\n\nWe will denote these as \u03b3 a below.\nOne can show [44] that if\n\nmeets the spinor conditions imposed by susy in the IIB theory, then\n\u01eb = \u01ebL + i\u01ebR\n\n(B.5)\n\nmeets the spinor conditions in the IIA theory. Here\n\u01eb\u0303L = \u03a9\u01ebL ,\n\n(B.6)\n\n\u01eb\u0303R = \u01ebR ,\n\n(B.7)\n\nand\n\u03a9 = \u2212\u221a\n\n1\n\u03b311 \u03b39 .\ngxx\n\n(B.8)\n\nThe above statement is true if the IIB and IIA fields are related under T-duality by the\ntransformations (A.6), (A.10).\nWe now turn to mapping the spinor conditions of type IIB to type IIA. We will not\ndemonstrate the map in full detail. Instead we give one representative example. Consider\nthe dilatino variation in the IIB theory. Since the dilaton-axion is constant in the IIB\ntheory, it is (eq.(2.3) of [42]):\n\u03b4 \u03bb\u0303 = \u2212\n\ni\nG\u0303\u01eb\u0303,\n24\n\n(B.9)\n\nwhere\nG\u0303 = \u03b3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 [G3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\n\n(B.10)\n\n[G3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 \u2261 [F3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c6 [H3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\nh i\n\u0001\n= F\u03033\n\u2212 i/gsIIB [H3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\n\n(B.11)\n\nwith\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3\n\nand \u01eb\u0303 = \u01eb\u0303L + i\u01eb\u0303R . Then using the relation between the vierbeins (B.1), we have the\nrelations:\n\u03b3\u0303 x = gxx \u03b3 x + [g + B]x\u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b1\n36\n\n\fand\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03b1 = \u03b3 \u03b1 .\nUsing the T-duality relations between the fields (A.10), the flux\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n[H3 ]\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = [H3 ]\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 + \u03c9(x) \u2227 B(x) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 g(x) \u2227 H3(x) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\n(B.12)\n\n[H3 ]x\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212\u03c9x\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(B.13)\n\nSo\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 [H3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = H3 \u2212 gxx g(x) \u2227 \u03c9(x) \u2212 g(x) \u2227 H3(x) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u03b3 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 gxx \u03b3 x\u03b1\u03b2 \u03c9x\u03b1\u03b2 .\n\n(B.14)\n\nAs mentioned at the end of this appendix, the RHS can be written as follows:\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 [H3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = H3 \u2212 gxx \u03b7 x \u2227 \u03c9(x) \u2212 \u03b7 x \u2227 H3(x) \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 .\n\n(B.15)\n\nSimilarly, using (A.10),\nh i\nF\u03033\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\nh i\n= F\u03034\n\nx\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\nand\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212 B(x) \u2227 F2 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 + B(x) \u2227 g(x) \u2227 F2(x) \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\nh i\nF\u03033\n\nx\u03b1\u03b2\n\nSo we find\nh i\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F\u03033\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n= F2 \u2212 g(x) \u2227 F2(x) \u03b1\u03b2 .\n\nh\ni\n= F\u03034(x) + gxx g(x) \u2227 F2\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u03b3 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 + gxx F2 \u2212 g(x) \u2227 F2(x) \u03b1\u03b2 \u03b3 x\u03b1\u03b2 . (B.16)\n\nOnce again as discussed at the end of the appendix this can be expressed as\nh i\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F\u03033\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\nh\ni\n= F\u03034(x) + gxx \u03b7 x \u2227 F2\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\n\n\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 .\n\n(B.17)\n\nFrom (B.15), (B.17) we obtain\n\u03b3\u0303 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 [G3 ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 = \u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 [GIIA ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 ,\n\n(B.18)\n\nwhere GIIA is a three-form in the IIA theory given by\n\u0010\n\nx\n\nGIIA = F\u03034(x) + gxx \u03b7 \u2227 F2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u221a\n\u0001\ni g xx\nH3 \u2212 gxx \u03b7 x \u2227 w(x) \u2212 \u03b7 x \u2227 H3(x) .\n\u2212\nIIA\ngs\n37\n\n(B.19)\n\n\fSetting the dilatino variation to zero in IIB sets the RHS of (B.18) to zero, yielding the\ncondition that\n\u03b3 \u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 [GIIA ]\u03bc\u03bd\u03c3 \u01eb\u0303 = 0.\n\n(B.20)\n\nThe ACS in IIA is defined by the relation (4.11). In turn this defines a holomorphic basis,\n(4.12), in which\n\u03b3 \u0131\u0304 \u01eb\u0303 = 0.\n\n(B.21)\n\nIt is then easy to see that (B.20) leads to the condition that the term in GIIA of type (3, 0)\nvanish and that the (2, 1) term satsifies the condition of primitivity (4.16).\nIt is straightforward to repeat this discussion for the gravitino variation in IIB theory.\nMapping the resulting conditions to IIA yield the additional constraints that GIIA is purely\nof type (2, 1) and primitive.\nWe end this discussion of the one T-duality case with two observations. First, we note\nthat (B.15) follows from (B.14), and (B.17) follows from (B.16), due to the fact that\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\n[\u03c9x \u2227 dx]\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = H3(x) \u2227 dx \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = g(x) \u2227 H3(x) x\u03b1\u03b2 = g(x) \u2227 \u03c9(x) x\u03b1\u03b2 = 0.\n\n(B.22)\n\nSecond, we note that the last term in the expression (B.19) for GIIA is absent. It arises\nfrom the term dj(x) in the original IIB theory on T 6 /Z2 , which vanishes since j(x) is a\nconstant in that theory.
