However, the result given there contains\na mistake. In this paper, we correct it.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLet p > 3 be a prime number and q a power of p. Let E be an elliptic curve over\nthe finite field Fq . Thus, we can assume that E has equation E : y 2 = x3 + ax + b.\nThe set of rational points on E, denoted by E(Fq ), has group structure. If n is an\ninteger, we denote by E(Fq )[n] (or E[n] if the field is the algebraic closure Fq of Fq )\nthe rational points of order n. If n is relatively prime with p, E[n] \u223c\n= Z/nZ \u00d7 Z/nZ.\nLet \u03c8n (x) be the division polynomials of E (see [1]). As it is well known, the\nroots of the polynomial \u03c8n are the abscissas of the n-torsion points, that is\nP = (x, y) \u2208 E[n] \u21d4 \u03c8n (x) = 0.\nHence, the factorisation patterns of these polynomial give information about the\nextension where the n-torsion points are defined.\nThe Frobenius endomorphism,\n\u03c6 : E(Fq ) \u2192 E(Fq )\n(x, y) \u2192 (xq , y q )\ncharacterizes the rationality of a point of the elliptic curve as follows\n\u2200P \u2208 E(Fq ), P \u2208 E(Fqn ) \u21d4 \u03c6n (P ) = P.\nIn the paper Factorisation of division polynomials (Proc. Japan Academy, Ser\nA. 80, no. 5, pp. 79-82), Verdure gives the degree and the number of factors of the\ndivision polynomial of an elliptic curve. However, the result present there contains\na mistake. We correct it here.\n\n2\n\nPatterns of l-th division polynomials\n\nLet l be an odd prime different from the characteristic of Fq . We present here the\nfactorisation patterns of division polynomial only when the l-torsion points generate\ndifferent extension fields (the wrong result in [2]). If all l-torsion points are defined\nover the same extension field, the factorisation can be found in [2].\n1\n\n\fFirst of all, we fix the notation. Let f be a one variable polynomial over a field\nK of degree n. We say that the factorisation pattern of f is\n((\u03b11 , n1 ), . . . , (\u03b1d , nd ))\nif f factorizes over K as\nf =k\n\nni\nd Y\nY\n\nPi,j\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nwith Pi,j an irreducible polynomial of degree \u03b1i .\nThe next result shows how the Frobenius endomorphism acts on E[l] when the\nl-torsion points are not all defined over the same extension of Fq .\nLemma 1 ([2]) Let E be an elliptic curve defined over Fq . Let \u03b1 be the degree\nof the minimal extension over which an l-torsion point is defined, l an odd prime\nnot equal to the characteristic of Fq . Assume that E[l] 6\u2282 E(Fq\u03b1 ). Then there exist\n\u03c1 \u2208 F\u2217l of order \u03b1 and a basis P, Q of E[l] over Fl in which the n-th power of the\nFrobenius endomorphism can be expressed, for all n, as:\n\u0012 n\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 n\n\u03c1\n0\n\u03c1 n\u03c1n\u22121\n0 ( \u03c1q )n\n0\n\u03c1n\n\nif \u03c12 6= q or \u03c12 = q respectively. The number \u03c1 is uniquely defined by the above\nproperties.\n\nThe previous result help us to determine the factorisation pattern of division\npolynomial \u03c8l (x) when its factors are not all of the same degree. The next proposition solves the mistake, in the function i(x, y), made in [2].\nProposition 2 Let E be an elliptic curve defined over Fq . Let \u03b1 be the degree of\nthe minimal extension over which E has a non-zero l-torsion point. Assume that\nE[l] 6\u2282 E(Fq\u03b1 ). Let \u03c1 \u2208 F\u2217l be as defined in Lemma 1. Let \u03b2 be the order of q/\u03c1 in\nF\u2217l . Then the pattern of the division polynomial \u03c8l is:\n((h(\u03b1),\n\n(l\u22121)2\nl\u22121\nl\u22121\n2h(\u03b1) ), (h(\u03b2), 2h(\u03b2) ), (i(\u03b1, \u03b2), 2i(\u03b1,\u03b2) ))\n\nif q 6= \u03c12 ,\n((h(\u03b1),\n\nl\u22121\nl\u22121\n2h(\u03b1) ), (h(\u03b1)l, 2h(\u03b1) ))\n\nif q = \u03c12 ,\nwith\nh(x) =\nand\ni(x, y) =\n\n(\n\nlcm(x,y)\n,\n2\n\nlcm(x, y),\n\n(\nx,\nx\n2\n\nx odd,\n,\nx even,\n\nx,y even and \u03c52 (x) = \u03c52 (y),\notherwise.\n2\n\n\fRemmark 3 Verdure gives the function i(x, y) = lcm(x, y)/2 when x and y are\nboth even.\nProof.\nWe follow the proof given in [2] except for the wrong cases.\nLet I be an irreducible factor \u03c8l (x) of degree d, and P a point of l-torsion\ncorresponding to one of its roots, then d is the minimum positive integer n such that\n\u03c6n (P ) = \u00b1P . Let (P, Q) be a basis of E[l] as in Lemma 1. We distinguish the cases\nq 6= \u03c12 and q = \u03c12 .\ni) Suppose that q 6= \u03c12 . If R is an l-torsion point which is a non-zero multiple\nof P (or Q), we have that the minimum n such that \u03c6n (R) = \u00b1R is n = h(\u03b1)\n(or h(\u03b2)). Notice that, \u03c6n (R) = \u2212R if and only if \u03b1 (or \u03b2) is even, and hence\nn = \u03b1/2 (or \u03b2/2).\nFinally, let R be any non-zero l-torsion point not of the previous form, then\nR = k(P + jQ) with 1 \u2264 j, k \u2264 l \u2212 1. So, \u03c6n (R) = k(\u03c6n (P ) + j\u03c6n (Q)). The\nsubgroup generated by R (hRi) is rational over Fqn if and only if \u03c6n (R) = \u00b1R.\nThe minimum extension where hRi is defined is Fqn , with n minimum such\nthat \u03c6n (R) = \u00b1R.\nIt is easy to prove that \u03c6n (R) = R if and only if \u03c6n (P ) = P and \u03c6n (Q) = Q.\nHence lcm(\u03b1, \u03b2) | n and n = lcm(\u03b1, \u03b2) is the minimum.\nOn the other hand, \u03c6n (R) = \u2212R, if and only if \u03c6n (P ) = \u2212P and \u03c6n (Q) = \u2212Q.\nThis is only possible when \u03b1 and \u03b2 are both even. Moreover, lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2) | n\nand \u03b1 or \u03b2 not divides lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2) (if, for example, \u03b1 | lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2), then\n\u03c6n (P ) = P ). On the other hand, \u03b1/2 and \u03b2/2 have the same parity, otherwise,\nfor example, if \u03b1/2 is even and \u03b2/2 odd then lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2) = lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2) and\n\u03b2 divides lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2) which is a contradiction. If \u03c52 (\u03b1) = \u03c52 (\u03b2), then n =\nlcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2) is the minimum integer such that \u03c6n (P ) = \u2212P and \u03c6n (Q) =\n\u2212Q. Otherwise, if both valuations are not equal, lcm(\u03b1/2, \u03b2/2) is divisible by\n\u03b1 if \u03c52 (\u03b1) < \u03c52 (\u03b2) (by \u03b2 if \u03c52 (\u03b1) > \u03c52 (\u03b2)) which contradicts \u03c6n (R) = \u2212R.\nCounting the number of points of each type, namely l \u2212 1, l \u2212 1 and (l \u2212 1)2 ,\nwe have the number of factors of each type.\nii) Suppose that q = \u03c12 . A point which is a non-zero multiple of P leads to factors\nof degree \u03b1 or \u03b1/2 as before. If R is not a multiple of P , then in order to have\n\u03c6n (R) = \u00b1R, we have that \u03c1n = \u00b11 and n\u03c1n\u22121 = 0. Then, depending on the\nparity of \u03b1, we have n = lcm(\u03b1, l) or n = lcm(\u03b1/2, l). Finally, since \u03b1 | l \u2212 1,\nit is relatively prime to l. Therefore, these values are h(\u03b1)l.\n\u0003\nExample 4 Consider the elliptic curve y 2 = x3 + 3x + 6 over F17 and take l =\n5. Then \u03b1 = 2 and \u03b2 = 4. According to [2], the pattern of \u03c85 (x) should be\n((1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 4)), but in fact it is ((1, 2), (2, 1), (4, 2)).\n\n3\n\n\fI am grateful to the referee, for this careful review and his suggestion at the\npreliminar version.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.H.
