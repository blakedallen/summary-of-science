INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Casimir calculations are usually accomplished by two methods: a global approach,\nwhen from the very beginning the total vacuum energy of quantum fields are calculated\nfor given boundary conditions, and a local consideration, when first the space density of\nthe vacuum energy is found. The both methods are in agreement if the integration of\nthe vacuum energy density gives the total Casimir energy. As known, the first example\nwhere this condition is not satisfied was a perfectly conducting wedge, i.e., two perfectly\nconducting plates that are crossed at given angle. The calculation of the Casimir energy for\nthese boundary conditions has the following peculiarities. The spectrum of electromagnetic\noscillations inside the wedge is continues and it does not depend explicitly on the opening\nangle of the wedge. The boundaries are flat therefore there is no problem with additional\ndivergences due to the boundary curvature. However, on the cross line of the plates the\nsmoothness of the boundary is obviously violated due to the cusp. Till now a correct\ndefinition of the total vacuum energy of the fields inside the wedge is lacking. It has been\ncalculated only the spatial density of vacuum energy inside the wedge. It turns out that this\ndensity possesses a non-integrable singularity \u223c r \u22124 in cylindrical coordinates r, \u03b8, z with\nthe z axes along the cross line of the plates. For the first time these calculations have been\ndone probably in Ref. [1] by making use of a simple method of images and later in Ref. [2]\nby applying the Green's function method. In recent publications [3,4] in the framework of\nthe Schwinger source theory it was shown how to avoid some mathematical inconsistency\ntaking place in previous calculations [2,5].\nThe geometry of space analogous to that between the crossing plates also encounters\nin other physical problems, in particular, in the cosmic string theory (the space outside\nthe string) and under consideration of quantum fields at finite temperature on the Rindler\nspace-time.\nThe geometry of space in the background of a cosmic string is determined by the solution\nof the Einstein equations with the energy-momentum tensor of matter defined by the string.\nWhen the string is located along the z axes and possesses the linear mass density \u03bc, then the\nspace outside the string is isomorphic to the manifold C2\u03c0\u2212\u03c6 \u00d7R1 , where R1 is an infinite line\nalong the z axes and instead of a plane perpendicular to this axes one has two dimensional\ncone C2\u03c0\u2212\u03c6 with the angle deficiency \u03c6 = 8\u03c0G\u03bc, G being the gravitational constant. The\ncone of an angle \u03b2 becomes a plane when \u03b2 = 2\u03c0. Certainly the boundary conditions for\nfields inside the wedge W\u03b1 \u00d7 R1 and on the space C\u03b2 \u00d7 R1 are in the general case different.\nFor the cone C\u03b2 the periodic boundary conditions are natural. For fields inside the wedge\nthe boundary conditions are determined by the relevant physical origin of the fields and by\nthe physical characteristics of the boundary.\nThe manifold C\u03b2 \u00d7 R2 arises under consideration of fields on the Rindler space-time\nat finite temperature \u03b2 \u22121 . In order to calculate the Helmholtz free energy and entropy of\nfields on this space the local zeta function technique was proposed [6]. A nontrivial problem\nencountered here is the construction of required analytic continuation of this zeta function.\nSuch a continuation has been accomplished separately for lower and higher eigenvalues of\nthe Laplace operator in the problem at hand.\nAs far as we know the Casimir energy for a perfectly conducting wedge at finite temperature was considered only in Ref. [7] by the multiple scattering method. In that paper\n2\n\n\funusual temperature dependence of the Casimir forces in this problem was noted. These\nforces, tending to reduce the angle \u03b1 between the plates, diminish when taking into account\nthe first temperature correction.\nThe present article seeks to show that the most simple and consistent (from the mathematical point of view) approach to the calculation of the Casimir effect for a perfectly\nconducting wedge is to use the local zeta function technique. In order to construct such\nspectral function one should find not only the spectrum of the regarding operator but also\nits eigenfunctions. When looking for the solutions to the Maxwell equations in confined\nregions (waveguides or resonators) it is convenient to use the Hertz potentials or Hertz vectors [2,8]. This technique considerably simplifies the calculations, specifically, removing the\nproblem of choosing the gauge. It is this way that we shall follow when constructing the\nlocal zeta function for electromagnetic field inside a perfectly conducting wedge W\u03b1 \u00d7 R1 .\nThe layout of the paper is as follows. In Section II the Hertz potentials are introduced\nand the solutions to Maxwell equations inside a perfectly conducting wedge are constructed.\nThese potentials are expressed in terms of two scalar functions which satisfy Dirichlet and\nNeumann boundary conditions. In Section III the local zeta function in the problem at hand\nis constructed. By a simple change of angle variable this function reduces to the analogous\none for a massless scalar field on the manifold C\u03b2 \u00d7 R1 , when \u03b2 = 2\u03b1. Therefore the analytic\ncontinuation developed in Ref. [6] is also applicable in our case. The local zeta function\nconstructed enables one to calculate the vacuum energy density of the electromagnetic field\ninside a wedge without subtraction of infinities. In Section IV transition to the global zeta\nfunction is carried out by introducing a cutoff nearby the cusp at the origin. Proceeding\nfrom this the heat kernel coefficients are calculated and the high temperature asymptotics\nof the Helmholtz free energy and of the torque of the Casimir forces are found. The wedge\nsingularity gives rise to a specific high temperature behaviour \u223c T 2 of the quantities under\nconsideration. The obtained results are directly applicable to the free energy of a scalar\nmassless field and electromagnetic field on the background of a cosmic string. In Section\nV we summarize our results. In the Appendix the local zeta functions are constructed for\nscalar massless fields inside a wedge with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.\nII. SOLUTION TO MAXWELL EQUATIONS IN TERMS OF HERTZ VECTORS\n\nFinding the solutions of Maxwell equations inside confined regions proves to be a rather\ndifficult problem. Mainly it is due to the vector character of the electromagnetic field. A\nconvenient technique for this purpose is to use the electric (\u03a0\u2032 ) and magnetic (\u03a0\u2032\u2032 ) Hertz\nvectors [8\u201310]. The Lorentz gauge condition\n1\u2202\u03c6\n=0\nc \u2202t\nis satisfied identically because the Hertz vectors are connected with the potentials A and \u03c6\nin the following way\n1\u2202\u03a0\nA=\n, \u03c6 = \u2212div \u03a0.\nc \u2202t\nFor boundary problems with cylindrical symmetry the electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields\nare expressed in terms of the Hertz vectors having only one nonzero component\ndivA +\n\n3\n\n\f\u03a0\u2032 = (0, 0, U),\n\n\u03a0\u2032\u2032 = (0, 0, V ).\n\n(2.1)\n\nHere cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03b8, z) are used with z axes directed along the intersection line\nof the wedge planes. The scalar functions U and V are the eigenfunctions of the Laplace\noperator and meet, respectively, Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the boundary \u2202\u0393\n\u2206U = \u03c9 2U,\n\u2206V = \u03c9 2 V,\n\nU|\u2202\u0393 = 0,\n\u2202V\n= 0.\n\u2202n \u2202\u0393\n\n(2.2)\n(2.3)\n\nWhen considering the electromagnetic field inside a perfectly conducting dihedral of opening\nangle \u03b1 (for simplicity, conducting wedge W\u03b1 ) the eigenvalues of the operator (\u2212\u2206) are\n\u03c9 2 \u2261 \u03c9 2 (k, \u03bb) = k 2 + \u03bb2 ,\n\n\u2212\u221e < k < \u221e,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03bb < \u221e,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith k being the wave vector along the z direction. In all the functions we have dropped for\nsimplicity the time-dependent factor ei\u03c9t . The spectrum (2.4) does not depend explicitly on\nthe opening angle \u03b1 of the wedge. This point proves to be a crucial one when attempting\nto construct a global zeta function in this problem (see Section IV).\nThe Dirichlet boundary value problem (2.2) has the following normalized eigenfunctions\n(E-modes)\neikz\nu\u03bbnk (r, \u03b8, z) = \u221a Jnp (\u03bbr) sin(np \u03b8),\n\u03c0\u03b1\n0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 \u03b1,\n\np = \u03c0/\u03b1,\n\nn = 1, 2, . . . ,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03bb < \u221e.\n\n(2.5)\n\nFor the Neumann boundary value problem (2.3) the normalized eigenfunctions (H-modes)\nhave the form\neikz\nv\u03bbnk (r, \u03b8, z) = \u03b7n0 \u221a Jnp (\u03bbr) cos(np\u03b8),\n\u03c0\u03b1\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n\n0 \u2264 \u03bb < \u221e,\n\n\u03b7n0 =\n\n(\n\n\u221a1 , n = 0,\n2\n1, n = 1, 2, . . . .\n\nThe eigenfunctions (2.5) and (2.6) meet the orthogonality condition\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\nZ \u03b1\n1\ndz\nr dr\nd\u03b8 f\u03bb\u2217\u2032 n\u2032 k\u2032 (r, \u03b8, z)f\u03bbnk (r, \u03b8, z) = \u03b4nn\u2032 \u03b4(\u03bb \u2212 \u03bb\u2032 ) \u03b4(k \u2212 k \u2032 )\n\u03bb\n\u2212\u221e\n0\n0\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\nand the completeness condition\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nn=0 (1)\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\ndk\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\u2217\n\u03bb d\u03bb f\u03bbnk\n(r \u2032 , \u03b8\u2032 , z \u2032 )f\u03bbnk (r, \u03b8, z) =\n\n4\n\n1\n\u03b4(r \u2212 r \u2032 ) \u03b4(z \u2212 z \u2032 ) \u03b4(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8\u2032 ) .\nr\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fHere f\u03bbnk (r, \u03b8, z) are the eigenfunctions (2.5) or (2.6). The relations (2.7) and (2.8) can be\neasily verified if one takes into account the formula [11]\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u03bb d\u03bb Jq (\u03bbr)Jq (\u03bbr \u2032 ) = \u03b4(r \u2212 r \u2032 ) .\nr\n0\nFor given Hertzian vectors \u03a0\u2032 and \u03a0\u2032\u2032 the electric and magnetic fields are constructed\nby the formulas\nE = \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 \u03a0\u2032 ,\nE = i\u03c9\u2207 \u00d7 \u03a0\u2032\u2032 ,\n\nH = \u2212i\u03c9\u2207 \u00d7 \u03a0\u2032\nH = \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 \u03a0\u2032\u2032\n\n(E-modes) ,\n(H-modes) .\n\n(2.9)\n\nIt has been proved [12] that the superposition of these modes gives the general solution to\nthe Maxwell equations in the problem under consideration.\nHowever in the zeta function formalism there is no need to recover the electric and\nmagnetic fields trough these formulas in order to construct the energy density or the energy\nmomentum tensor as one proceeds when the Green's function technique is used [2\u20134]. It is\nan essential merit of the approach considered.\nIII. LOCAL ZETA FUNCTION FOR PERFECTLY CONDUCTING WEDGE\n\nAt the beginning we remind a few general formulas that define a local zeta function. Let\nwe have a differential operator L with well posed eigenvalue problem (here it is convenient\nto use the Dirac bracket notation)\nLfn (x) = \u03bbn fn (x) or L|n >= \u03bbn |n > .\n\n(3.1)\n\nBy making use of the completeness of the vector set {|n >}, one can represent (formally) a\nunity operator I acting in the linear space of the vectors |n > as follows\nX\nI=\n|n >< n| .\n(3.2)\nn\n\nIn view of this, we have for the inverse operator L\u22121\nL\u22121 =\n\nX |n >< n|\n\u03bbn\n\nn\n\n.\n\n(3.3)\n\nIt can be easily checked with allowance for Eq. (3.1). For the sth power of the inverse\noperator L\u22121 we can write\nL\u2212s =\n\nX |n >< n|\n\u03bbsn\n\nn\n\n.\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe local zeta function \u03b6(s, x) of the operator L is a diagonal matrix element of the operator L\u2212s\n5\n\n\f\u03b6(s, x) =\n\nX < x|n >< n|x >\nn\n\n\u03bbsn\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u2217\n\u03bb\u2212s\nn fn (x)fn (x) .\n\n(3.5)\n\nn\n\nThe global zeta function\n\u03b6(s) =\n\nX\n\n\u03bb\u2212s\nn\n\n(3.6)\n\nn\n\nis obtained by integration of \u03b6(s, x) over the whole space\nZ\n\u03b6(s) = \u03b6(s, x) dx .\n\n(3.7)\n\nThus the local zeta function \u03b6(s, x) can be interpreted as a spatial density for the global\nzeta function \u03b6(s).\nWhen calculating the vacuum energy of a relativistic quantum field E0 by making use of\nthe zeta function regularization [13,14], we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nE0 = \u03b6 s = \u2212\n,\n(3.8)\n2\n2\nwith the operator L being the spatial part of the relevant differential operator defining the\nfield dynamics in the problem at hand. In this case \u03bbn = \u03c9n2 , where \u03c9n are the classical\ncharacteristic frequencies of the field under study. In view of Eqs. (3.7) and (3.8), the\nquantity (1/2)\u03b6(\u22121/2, x) can be interpreted as the vacuum energy density calculated in\nthe framework of the zeta function regularization. Besides that, it is easy to show that\nthe vacuum expectation value of the canonical energy-momentum tensor of non-interacting\nscalar field can be represented in the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1 X 1/2 \u2217\n\u03bb f (x)fn (x) = \u03b6 \u2212 , x .\n(3.9)\n< 0|T00 (x)|0 >=\n2 n n n\n2\n2\nIn this case the operator L is simply \u2212\u2206.\nThe main difficulty in obtaining the local zeta function (3.5), as well as the global one\n(3.6), is an analytic continuation of these formula to the region Re s < 1.\nIt is remarkable that for constructing the local zeta function \u03b6(s, x) only the spectrum\nand the eigenfunctions of the relevant operator are needed. The explicit form of the regarding physical fields (for example, electromagnetic fields) is not involved in these formulas.\nTherefore we shall not use Eq. (2.9) determining the electric and magnetic fields. Instead\nof that we proceed from the spectrum (2.4) in the problem at hand and the respective\neigenfunctions (2.5) and (2.6).\nSubstituting Eqs. (2.4), (2.5) and (2.6) into the definition of the local zeta function (3.5)\nwe obtain\n(\n)\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u221e\nX\n1\n1 2\n\u03bbd\u03bb\n2\n\u03b6(s, r, \u03b8, z) =\ndk\nJ (\u03bbr) +\nJnp\n(\u03bbr)[sin2 (np\u03b8) + cos2 (np\u03b8)]\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u2212\u221e 0 (k 2 + \u03bb2 )s 2 0\nn=1\n\"\n#\nZ \u221e Z \u221e\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u03bbd\u03bb\n1 2\n2\ndk\n=\nJ (\u03bbr) +\nJnp\n(\u03bbr) .\n(3.10)\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u2212\u221e 0 (k 2 + \u03bb2 )s 2 0\nn=1\n6\n\n\fThus the local zeta function in the problem at hand is independent of the angle variable\n\u03b8 and, that is natural, of z due to the homogeneity of the system in the z-direction. For\nsimplicity, we shall drop these arguments in what follows.\nBy making use of the value of the integral\nZ \u221e\n\u221a 1\u22122s \u0393(s \u2212 1/2)\ndk\n1\n\u03c0\u03bb\n=\n, Re s > ,\n(3.11)\n2\n2\ns\n\u0393(s)\n2\n\u2212\u221e (k + \u03bb )\nwe cast Eq. (3.10) into the form\n\u221e\n\n1 \u0393(s \u2212 1/2) X\u2032\n\u03b6(s, r) = \u221a\n\u0393(s)\n\u03c0\u03b1\nn=0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n2\n\u03bb2\u22122s Jnp\n(\u03bbr)d\u03bb .\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe prime on the summation sign means that the n = 0 term is taken with half weight.\nNow we have to use the following integration formula (see equation 6.574.2 with \u03bc = \u03bd\nin Ref. [15])\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03bd \u2212 \u03bb + 1\n\u03bb\u22121\nZ \u221e\n\u03b1 \u0393(\u03bb)\u0393\n2\n\u2212\u03bb 2\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013,\n\u0012\nt J\u03bd (\u03b1t)dt =\n2\u03bd + \u03bb + 1\n\u03bb+1\n0\n\u03bb\n2\n\u0393\n2 \u0393\n2\n2\nRe (2\u03bd + 1) > Re \u03bb > 0,\n\n\u03b1 > 0.\n\n(3.13)\n\nApplying this formula we can accomplish the integration in each term in Eq. (3.12) for the\nrespective values of the variable s restricted by the equalities\n1 < Re s < np +\n\n3\n,\n2\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . .\n\n(3.14)\n\nIn these regions the integral (3.13) converges. Therefore the objections against using this\nformula brought up in Ref. [3] are obviously not applicable here. As a result, we obtain\n\u221e\n\n1\n\u0393(s \u2212 1) X\u2032 \u0393(np + 3/2 \u2212 s)\n\u03b6(s, r) =\n.\n2\u03c0\u03b1r 3\u22122s \u0393(s) n=0 \u0393(np + s \u2212 1/2)\n\n(3.15)\n\nWhen deriving this equation the formula for the doubling of the gamma function argument\n[15]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u22121/2 2z\u22121/2\n(3.16)\n\u0393(2z) = (2\u03c0)\n2\n\u0393(z)\u0393 z +\n2\nhas been used.\nBy making use of the asymptotics of the ratio of two gamma functions [16], one can\neasily show (see below) that the series (3.15) converges in the region\nRe s >\n\n3\n,\n2\n7\n\n(3.17)\n\n\fwhile the first term with n = 0 in the sum (3.15) is defined in the region\n1 < Re s <\n\n3\n.\n2\n\n(3.18)\n\nThus in the problem under study, there is no representation for the local zeta function (3.15)\ndetermining it as an analytic function of the complex variable s in a finite region. The first\nterm in Eq. (3.15) is defined in the region (3.18) but the rest of the sum is defined in the\nstrip\n3\n3\n< Re s < + 1 .\n2\n2\n\n(3.19)\n\nCheeger has proposed to overcome this difficulty in the following way [17]. The analytic\ncontinuation should be constructed separately for the first term with n = 0 in Eq. (3.15) and\nfor the rest sum in this equation. Further the obtained results should be added. Obviously,\nsuch a continuation is unique.\nFollowing the paper [6], we introduce the function\nG2\u03b1 (s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u0393(np \u2212 s + 1)\nn=1\n\n\u0393(np + s)\n\n,\n\nRe s > 1 .\n\n(3.20)\n\nFor \u03b1 = \u03c0 (p = 1) we have\nG2\u03c0 (s) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u0393(n \u2212 s + 1)\nn=1\n\n=\n\n\u0393(n + s)\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 \u2212 s (1 \u2212 s)(2 \u2212 s)\n\u0393(1 \u2212 s)\n1+\n=\n+\n+ ...\u2212 1\n\u0393(s)\ns\ns(1 + s)\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 s)\n[F (1 \u2212 s, 1; s; 1) \u2212 1] ,\n\u0393(s)\n\nRe s > 1,\n\nwhere F (\u03b1, \u03b2; \u03b3; z) is the hypergeometric function. Equation 9.122.1 from Ref. [15] gives\nF (1 \u2212 s, 1; s; 1) =\n\n\u0393(s)\u0393(2s \u2212 2)\n,\n\u0393(2s \u2212 1)\u0393(s \u2212 1)\n\nRe s > 1 .\n\nFinally we obtain\nG2\u03c0 (s) = \u2212\n\n\u0393(1 \u2212 s)\n,\n2\u0393(s)\n\nRe s > 1 .\n\n(3.21)\n\nThe right-hand side of this equation can naturally be considered as an analytic continuation\nof the function G2\u03c0 (s) to all over the complex plane s. On the other hand, the expression in\nthe right-hand side of Eq. (3.21) for 1/2 < Re s < 1 is nothing else as the first term with\nn = 0 in the sum in Eq. (3.15). Thus the analytical continuation of the first term in the\nsum (3.15) is trivial.\nThe basic idea of the analytical continuation of the function G2\u03b1 (s) for \u03b1 6= \u03c0 proposed\nby Cheeger [17] is also simple. It relies on the fact that the n-th term of the series (3.20)\nhas a polynomial asymptotics for large n\n8\n\n\f\u221e\n\nan =\n\nX\n\u0393(np \u2212 s + 1)\n\u223c (np)1\u22122s\ncj (s)(np)\u22122j ,\n\u0393(np + s)\nj=0\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhere the functions cj (s) are calculated exactly upon substituting in Eq. (3.22) the know\nasymptotics for the gamma function [6,16]. From Eq. (3.22) it follows immediately that the\nseries in Eq. (3.20) determining the function G2\u03b1 (s) is convergent for\nRe s > 1 .\n\n(3.23)\n\nWhen summing over n, the terms in the asymptotics (3.22) with\nRe (2s + 2j \u2212 1) \u2264 1\n\n(3.24)\n\nlead to the divergences. Therefore, it is natural to substitute these sums by respective values\nof the Riemann zeta function \u03b6R (s) [6]\nX\nG2\u03b1 (s) = p1\u22122s\np\u22122j cj (s) \u03b6R (2s + 2j \u2212 1) + analytical part ,\n(3.25)\n0\u2264j\u22641\u2212Re s\n\nwhere the analytical part is the sum of the differences between an and the asymptotic terms\nin Eq. (3.19) picked out in the way described above. In the general case, it is impossible\nto calculate this analytical part, i.e., to express it in terms of known analytical functions.\nHowever, for\n1\n3\nk\n1\ns = , 0, \u2212 , \u22121, \u2212 , . . . , \u2212\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n(3.26)\n\nthis part vanishes because for these values of s the ratio an in Eq. (3.22) reduces to the finite\npolynomial in n. The positive integer k in Eq. (3.26) obviously depends on the number\nof asymptotic terms in Eq. (3.26) summed by the Riemann zeta function in the course of\nanalytical continuation. Thus for values of the variable s listed in Eq. (3.20) there is an\nexplicit representation of the function G2\u03b1 (s) in terms of the Riemann zeta function. For\nthe boundary value s = 1 the series defining the function G2\u03b1 (s) diverges\nG2\u03b1 (1) =\n\n\u221e\nX\nn=1\n\n\u221e\n\n\u0393(np)\n1X1\n=\n.\n\u0393(np + 1)\np n=1 n\n\n(3.27)\n\nIt leads to a simple pole at the point s = 1 which acquires the analytic continuation of the\nfunction G2\u03b1 (s) to the region Re s < 1.\nIn view of Eqs. (3.20) and (3.21), the zeta function (3.15) can be represented in the form\n\u03b6(s, r) =\n\n1\n\u0393(s \u2212 1)\n1\nI2\u03b1 (s \u2212 1/2)\n[G2\u03b1 (s \u2212 1/2) \u2212 G2\u03c0 (s \u2212 1/2)] = \u221a\n,\n3\u22122s\n3\u22122s\n2\u03c0\u03b1r\n\u0393(s)\n2 \u03c0\u03b1r\n\u0393(s)\n(3.28)\n\nwhere, following Ref. [6], we have introduced the function\n9\n\n\fI2\u03b1 (s) =\n\n\u0393(s \u2212 1/2)\n\u221a\n[G2\u03b1 (s) \u2212 G2\u03c0 (s)] .\n\u03c0\n\n(3.29)\n\nThis function, as well as G2\u03b1(s) , possesses only a simple pole at the point s = 1. At the first\nsight the gamma function \u0393(s\u22121/2), entering in the definition of I2\u03b1 (s), leads to the poles for\ns = 1/2, \u22121/2, \u22123/2, . . . . However, it can be shown [6] that the difference G2\u03b1 (s) \u2212 G2\u03c0 (s)\nvanishes at these points.\nThe local zeta function (3.28) for electromagnetic field inside a perfectly conducting\ndihedral of opening angle \u03b1 is equal to twice the corresponding zeta function for a massless\nscalar field on the space C\u03b2 \u00d7 R1 with \u03b2 = 2\u03b1, where C\u03b2 is a cone of angle \u03b2 [6]. This\nconclusion is obvious if one takes into account the relation between corresponding boundary\nvalue problems (see Eq. (12) in Ref. [18]). It is also easy to arrive at this conclusion directly\nwriting out a complete set of the eigenfunction for a scalar massless field on the manifold\nC \u03b2 \u00d7 R1 :\nsin\neikz\n(np\u03b8),\nf\u03bbnk (r, \u03b8, z) = \u03b7n0 \u221a Jnp (\u03bbr)\ncos\n\u03c0\u03b2\n\nn = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n\np=\n\n2\u03c0\n.\n\u03b2\n\n(3.30)\n\nIn this case all the eigenvalues with n = 1, 2, . . . turn out to be double degenerate, each\nof them has two eigenfunctions proportional to sin(np\u03b8) or cos(np\u03b8). The local zeta functions for scalar fields inside a wedge with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are\nconstructed in The Appendix.\nIn order to find in the approach developed the spatial distribution of the vacuum energy\ninside the conducting wedge (see Eqs. (3.8) and (3.18)) the value of G2\u03b1 (\u22121) should be\ncalculated. Here we show how to do this applying the procedure of analytic continuation of\nthe function G2\u03b1 (s) described above.\nFrom Eq. (3.24) it follows that for s = \u22121 three terms with j = 0, 1, 2 in the asymptotics\n(3.22) should be summed by making use of the Riemann zeta function. For s = \u22121 Eq.\n(3.22) gives\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0393(np + 2)\n1\n3\n.\n(3.31)\n= (np) 1 \u2212\n\u0393(np \u2212 1)\n(np)2\nComparing Eqs.

(3.28) and taking into account that\n2\n\u0393(\u22123/2)\n=\u2212 ,\n\u0393(\u22121/2)\n3\nwe find\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03b6 \u2212 ,r\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n=\u2212\n\n1\n(p2 \u2212 1)(p2 + 11)\n360\u03c0 2 r 4\n\nand respectively for the density of the vacuum energy\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n(p2 \u2212 1)(p2 + 11) ,\n\u03c1(r) = \u03b6 \u2212 , r = \u2212\n2\n2\n720\u03c0 2 r 4\n\n(3.37)\n\np=\n\n\u03c0\n.\n\u03b1\n\n(3.38)\n\nFor \u03b1 < \u03c0 (p > 1) the vacuum energy density is negative, and it vanishes for \u03b1 = \u03c0 (p = 1),\nwhen the wedge transforms into semispace. Putting in Eq. (3.38) \u03b1 \u2192 0 and r \u2192 \u221e in\nsuch a way that r\u03b1 = d = constant, one arrives at the vacuum energy density between two\nparallel perfectly conducting plates\n\u03c1plates = \u2212\n\n\u03c02\n.\n720 d4\n11\n\n(3.39)\n\n\fMultiplying this expression by the volume of space bounded by plates S d, where S is the\narea of the plate surface, we obtain the well known Casimir energy [19,20]\nEC = \u2212\n\n\u03c02S\n.\n720 d3\n\n(3.40)\n\nThe vacuum energy density (3.38) posses non-integrable singularity at the point r = 0.\nHere we shall not touch the physical origin of this singularity. It is discussed in the literature\nfor a long time (see, for example, Refs. [2,3,21]). When defining the global quantities in the\nproblem at hand, we simply introduce a cutoff at the lower limit of integration over r. Thus\nfor the total energy we have\nZ \u221e\nZ \u03b1\n(p2 \u2212 1)(p2 + 11)\n.\n(3.41)\nE=\nrdr\nd\u03b8 \u03c1(r) = \u2212\u03b1\n1440\u03c0 2 \u03b52\n\u03b5\n0\nHaving calculated the energy density for a conducting wedge, one can immediately recover all the components of the relevant energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd [2]. In fact, taking\ninto account the symmetries of the problem and the vanishing of the trace and divergence\nof T\u03bc\u03bd one finds\nT\u03bc\u03bd =\n\n1\nf (\u03b8, \u03b1) diag(1, \u22123, 1, 1) = (Trr , T\u03b8\u03b8 , Tzz , \u2212\u03c1)\nr4\n\n(3.42)\n\nwith some function f (\u03b8, \u03b1), vanishing when \u03b1 = \u03c0. Substituting \u03c1 on the right-hand side of\nEq. (3.42) by Eq. (3.38) we obtain\n(p2 \u2212 1)(p2 + 11)\nf (\u03b1) =\n.\n720\u03c0 2\nThus all the components of the energy-momentum tensor are found. Specifically, we conclude\nthat the surface density of the Casimir force F (r) acting on the wedge faces is\nF (r) = \u2212T\u03b8\u03b8 (r) =\n\n(p2 \u2212 1)(p2 + 11)\n.\n240\u03c0 2 r 4\n\nThese forces tend to diminish the opening angle \u03b1 between the wedge plates.\nThe torque of the Casimir forces about the origin is\nZ \u221e\n3E\n(p2 \u2212 1)(p2 + 11)\nM=\n=\u2212\n.\nF (r) r dr =\n2\n2\n480\u03c0 \u03b5\n\u03b1\n\u03b5\n\n(3.43)\n\n(3.44)\n\nCertainly it depends on the cutoff parameter \u03b5. We again recall that all the quantities found\nin our study are related to a unit length along the z direction.\nIV. HIGH TEMPERATURE ASYMPTOTICS OF THE CASIMIR EFFECT FOR\nA CONDUCTING WEDGE\n\nIn this section we briefly consider the application of the constructed zeta function to\ninvestigation of the temperature behavior of the problem under consideration. In the general\n12\n\n\fcase, to find the temperature dependence of the local characteristics proves to be a rather\ncomplicated problem that still waits its complete solution [21]. Therefore we address the\nglobal thermodynamical function of electromagnetic filed inside a perfectly conducting wedge\n(the Helmhotz free energy). For this purpose we need the global zeta function. However Eq.\n(3.7) cannot be used for this purpose directly due to non-integrable singularity at r = 0 of\nthe local zeta function (3.28). We again introduce a cutoff in the r integral\nZ \u221e\nZ \u03b1\n\u03b6(s) =\nrdr\nd\u03b8 \u03b6(s, r)\n\u03b5\n\n0\n\n1\n\u0393(s \u2212 1)\n=\n[G2\u03b1 (s \u2212 1/2) \u2212 G2\u03c0 (s \u2212 1/2)]\n1\u22122s\n2\u03c0\u03b5\n(1 \u2212 2s) \u0393(s)\nI2\u03b1 (s \u2212 1/2)\n= \u221a 1\u22122s\n.\n2 \u03c0\u03b5\n(1 \u2212 2s)\u0393(s)\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe appearance of the cutoff here can be formally explained in the following way. In\nthe general case, the local zeta function (3.5) is, from the mathematical stand point, a\ndistribution. Therefore its complete definition requires specification of the relevant set of\ntest functions. In the problem at hand one can choose the test functions proportional to\nthe step function \u03b8(r \u2212 \u03b5). Certainly this consideration is a formal one, and the problem\nof constructing the global zeta function for boundary conditions in question still waits its\nsolution.\nOne could try to substitute the known spectrum (2.4) directly in the definition of the\nglobal zeta function (3.7). However, without introducing a cutoff the integration cannot be\ndone here Really,\nZ\nZ\nZ \u221e\n1 \u0393(s \u2212 1/2) \u221e 2\u22122s\n\u03bb d\u03bb\ndk \u221e\n\u03bb\nd\u03bb .\n(4.2)\n= \u221a\n\u03b6\u0304(s) =\n(k 2 + \u03bb2 )s\n2 \u03c0\n\u0393(s)\n0\n\u2212\u221e 2\u03c0 0\nOn introducing the exponential regularization in the \u03bb-integral we obtain\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n\u0393(3 \u2212 2s)\n2\u22122s\n\u03bb\nd\u03bb \u2192\n.\ne\u2212\u03b5\u03bb \u03bb2\u22122s d\u03bb =\n\u03b53\u22122s\n0\n0\n\n(4.3)\n\nFinally the zeta function \u03b6\u0304(s) acquires the form\n1 \u0393(s \u2212 1/2) \u0393(3 \u2212 2s)\n\u03b6\u0304(s) = \u221a\n.\n\u0393(s)\n\u03b53\u22122s\n2 \u03c0\n\n(4.4)\n\nThis expression disagrees with Eq. (4.1). The substantial shortcoming of the formula (4.4),\nin comparison with Eq. (4.1), is independence of the opening angle \u03b1. Therefore we shall\nuse further the zeta function (4.1).\nThe global zeta function (4.1) enables one to construct immediately the high temperature\nasymptotics of the thermodynamical functions in the problem at hand [22]. Here it is\nworth reminding that in our consideration we are dealing only with the spatial part of\nthe differential operator governing the fluctuation dynamics of electromagnetic field (see\nEqs. (2.2) and (2.3)). Therefore the corresponding global zeta function enables one to\nconstruct, in a direct way, only the high temperature asymptotics of the thermodynamical\n13\n\n\fcharacteristics in the problem under study. In order to investigate complete temperature\nbehavior of these characteristics a complete spectral zeta function is needed that involves\nalso the summation over the Matsubara frequencies.\nThe high temperature expansion for the Helmholtz free energy has the form [23] (~ =\nc = 1)\nF (T ) \u2243\n\nT \u2032\n\u03b6 (0) +\n2\n\nX\n\nan T 4\u22122n cn ,\n\nn=0,1/2,1,3/2,...\n\nT \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(4.5)\n\n***,\n\n(4.6)\n\nHere cn 's are numerical coefficients\nc0 = \u2212\n\n\u03c02\n,\n90\n\nc1/2 = \u2212\n\n\u03b6R (3)\n,\n4\u03c0 3/2\n\nc1 = \u2212\n\n1\n,\n24\n\nsafe for c3/2 and c2 , which also depend on ln T , and an 's are the heat kernel coefficients. The\nlatter are determined by the zeta function through the relation\n\u0012\n\u0013\nan\n3\n\u03b6(s)\u0393(s), n = 0, 1/2, 1, . . . .\n(4.7)\n= lim s + n \u2212\n(4\u03c0)3/2 s\u2192 23 \u2212n\n2\nAs follows from Eq. (4.1) the zeta function \u03b6(s) has simple poles at the point s = 1/2\n(due to the multiplier (1 \u2212 2s) in the denominator) and at the point s = 3/2 because the\nfunction I2\u03b1 (z) has such a pole at the point z = 1. Thus, only the heat kernel coefficients\na0 and a1 do not vanish in the problem under study. This is in full accord with the general\nproperties of the heat kernel expansion [24]. Indeed, for flat manifolds without boundary or\nwith flat boundary all the heat kernel coefficients except for a0 are equal to zero.\nAnd what is more, one can show in the general case that the heat kernel coefficient a0 is\nequal to the volume of the system under consideration. The corresponding term in the high\ntemperature expansion (4.5)\n\u2212a0\n\n\u03c02 4\nT\n90\n\nis the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the free energy of electromagnetic field in the space restricted\nby the boundaries\n\u03c02\n2\nF\n= \u2212 T 4 = \u2212 \u03c3T 4 ,\nV\n90\n3\n\n(4.8)\n\n4\nwhere \u03c3 = \u03c0 2 kB\n/(60c2~3 ) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.\nWhen the system has an infinite volume (just that very case is considered here), a special\nlimiting procedure should be used in calculations of a0 (see, for example, Ref. [25]). In the\nproblem at hand this implies the introduction of a cutoff also at large values of r: \u03b5 \u2264 r \u2264 R.\nIn view of this the substitution of the zeta function (4.1) into Eq. (4.7) gives\n\na0 = (R2 \u2212 \u03b52 )(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c0) .\n\n(4.9)\n\nIn the problem at hand we are dealing with two independent scalar fields. Therefore the\nvalue (4.9) should be compared with doubled volume of the system under study\n14\n\n\f2V = 2\u03c0(R2 \u2212 \u03b52 )\n\n\u03b1\n= (R2 \u2212 \u03b52 ) \u03b1 .\n2\u03c0\n\n(4.10)\n\nIt is worth noting once more that all our formulas give the quantities per unit length along\nthe axes OZ. The distinction between Eqs. (4.9) and (4.10) are obviously attributed to a\nspecial condition satisfied by the zeta function (4.1), namely, \u03b6(s) = 0 for \u03b1 = \u03c0.\nAll the terms in the asymptotics (4.5), safe for the term with n = 0, describe the deviation\nfrom the Stefan-Boltzmann law. In the problem in question the coefficient a1 does not vanish\ndue to the discontinuity of the boundary at the point r = 0 (wedge or cone singularity).\nThere is a voluminous literature concerning with such a singularity. we mention here only\na few papers [6,17,26\u201329] where further references can be found.\nTaking into account the behaviour of the gamma function at the origin \u0393(s) \u223c s\u22121 , s \u2192\n0 we deduce from Eq.

(3.25)\nwith j = 0, 1. It gives\nG2\u03b1 (0) = lim p1\u22122s [c0 (s)\u03b6R (2s \u2212 1) \u2212 p\u22122 c1 (s)\u03b6R (2s + 1)].\ns\u21920\n\n(4.15)\n\nThe coefficients c0 (s) and c1 (s) are explicitly written, for example, in Ref.

The authors have used the method of images for constructing the Green's\nfunctions of electromagnetic field inside the dihedral, the photon energy being cut in ultraviolet region. In terms of the notations used in the present paper, the high temperature\nasymptotics of M found in Ref. [1] reads\nM\u2243\n\n1 The\n\n\u03c0T\n,\n12\u03b12 \u03b5\n\nT \u2192 \u221e.\n\nexamples of such asymptotics can be found in Ref. [22]\n\n16\n\n(4.23)\n\n\fHere we have also to ascertain disagreement with our calculations.\nIn the preceding section it was shown that the zeta function of electromagnetic field\ninside a perfectly conducting dihedral of opening angle \u03b1 is equal to double zeta function\nfor a massless scalar field on the manifold C\u03b2 \u00d7 R1 with 2\u03b1 = \u03b2, where C\u03b2 is a cone of angle\n\u03b2. Therefore all the results obtained in our consideration are directly applicable to the\nmassless scalar field on the manifold C\u03b2 \u00d7 R1 , in particular to the cosmic string background.\nReally, the general solution to the Maxwell equations in the presence of a cosmic string\nare expressed in terms of two scalar massless fields that satisfy the periodicity conditions\nin angle variable with a period \u03b2 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6, where \u03c6 is the deficiency angle of the metric\ndue to the cosmic string, \u03c6 = 8\u03c0G\u03bc. Most simply one can come to this conclusion in\nthe following way. Let us assume that the string has a finite transverse size, rstr , and its\nsurface is perfectly conducting. Obviously, the reasonings of the Section II apply to this\nboundary configuration, two scalar functions U and V being periodic in angle variable \u03b8\nand meeting the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at r = rstr . Letting rstr\ntend to zero, we substitute the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at r = rstr\nby requirement that the relevant solutions to be bounded everywhere including the origin:\n0 \u2264 r < \u221e. The periodicity condition in angle variable \u03b8 apparently remains. From here we\ninfer that the local zeta function for electromagnetic field in the presence of cosmic string is\nobtained from the relevant zeta function for the conducting wedge (3.28) by the substitution\n2\u03b1 = 2\u03c0 \u2212 8\u03c0G\u03bc. Specifically, for the vacuum energy density in this case we have again Eq.\n(3.39) with the same substitution. The same result was obtained in Ref. [30] by making use\nof the Greens function method. Further, the high temperature corrections to the StefanBoltzmann law for the free energy of electromagnetic field on the background of a cosmic\nstring are given by the formula\nF (T ) \u2243\n\nT \u03b6R (3)\nT 2 \u03c6 4\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6\n+\n,\n32\u03c0 3 \u03b5\n72~c 2 2\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c6\n\nT \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(4.24)\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nWe have shown that the technique of the local zeta function enables one to carry out, in\na consistent way, the calculation of the vacuum energy density of electromagnetic field inside\na conducting wedge without dealing with obvious divergences. This regularization method\nleads to a finite expression for the energy density under study without any subtractions.\nOur consideration is a natural addition to studies of the Casimir effect for a wedge accomplished in recent papers [3,4] by making use of Green's function method. Employment of\nthe Hertz potentials for constructing the general solution of the Maxwell equations results in\na considerable simplification of the calculations of the local zeta function in the problem at\nhand. Transition to the global zeta function has been carried out by introducing a cutoff for\nsmall r. On this basis the nonzero heat kernel coefficients a0 , a1 , and the zeta determinant\nwere calculated. Remarkably that the coefficient a1 does not depend on the cutoff and it is\ncompletely determined by the wedge singularity of the boundary. Proceeding from this the\nhigh temperature asymptotics of the Helmholtz free energy and of the torque of the Casimir\nforces are found. The wedge singularity gives rise to a specific high temperature behaviour\n17\n\n\f\u223c T 2 of the quantities under consideration. The found results are directly applicable to the\nfree energy of electromagnetic field on the background of a cosmic string.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nV.V.N. is grateful to Dr. D. V.

(A1) can be stored in a single term\n#\n\"\nZ\n\u221e\nX\n1\n\u0393(s \u2212 1/2) \u221e\n1\n2\n2\nJnp (\u03bbr) \u2212 J0 (2\u03bbr sin p\u03b8)\n\u03b6D (s, r, \u03b8) = \u221a\nd\u03bb \u03bb2\u22122s J0 (\u03bbr) +\n2\n2\n2 \u03c0\u03b1\u0393(s) 0\nn=1\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u0393(s \u2212 1/2)\n\u221a\n= \u03b6(s, r) \u2212\nd\u03bb \u03bb2\u22122s J0 (2\u03bbr sin(p\u03b8)) ,\n(A2)\n2\n4 \u03c0\u03b1\u0393\n0\nwhere \u03b6(s, r) is the local zeta function for electromagnetic field in a conducting wedge defined\nin Eq. (3.10). By making use of the integration formula 6.561.14 from [15]\n\u0001\nZ \u221e\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc \u2212\u03bc\u22121 \u0393 2 + 2 \u03bd + 2 \u03bc\n\u0001 \u2212 Re \u03bd \u2212 1 < Re \u03bc < , a > 0\nx J\u03bd (ax)dx = 2 a\n1\n1\n1\n2\n\u0393 2 + 2\u03bd \u2212 2\u03bc\n0\nwe cast Eq. (A2) into the final form\n\n18\n\n\f1\n\u0393(3/2 \u2212 s)\n1\n.\n\u03b6D (s, r, \u03b8) = \u03b6(s, r) + \u221a\n3\u22122s\n2\n\u0393(s)\n8 \u03c0\u03b1(r sin(p\u03b8))\n\n(A3)\n\nThe last term in Eq. (A3) is first defined in the strip\n3\n3\n< Re s < ,\n4\n2\n\n(A4)\n\ndetermined by the conditions of applicability of Eq. (A3). As usual under the analytic\ncontinuation, we assume that outside this strip the same equation holds.\nProceeding along similar lines we obtain the local zeta function for the Neumann boundary conditions\n1\n1\n\u0393(3/2 \u2212 s)\n\u03b6D (s, r, \u03b8) = \u03b6(s, r) \u2212 \u221a\n.\n2\n8 \u03c0\u03b1(r sin(p\u03b8))3\u22122s\n\u0393(s)\n\n(A5)\n\nIn particular the vacuum energy densities for massless scalar fields subjected to the Dirichlet\nand Neumann boundary conditions on the wage sites are\n\u03c1D (r, \u03b8) = \u03c1\u2212 (r, \u03b8),\n\n\u03c1N (r, \u03b8) = \u03c1+ (r, \u03b8),\n\n(A6)\n\nwhere\n1\n1\n,\n\u03c1\u00b1 (r, \u03b8) = \u03c1(r) \u00b1\n4\n2\n16\u03c0\u03b1r sin4 (p\u03b8)\n\n(A7)\n\nand \u03c1(r) is the vacuum energy density of electromagnetic field, defined in Eq. (3.38).\nThus the vacuum energy densities derived have nonintegrable singularities near by the\nwedge sites. It is a typical behaviour of spatial distribution of the Casimir energy (see, for\nexample, Ref. [31]).\nThe local zeta function technique, consider in the present paper, cannot directly be\napplied to the scalar field with conformal coupling. The point is that in this case the\nrelation (3.9) does not hold.\n\n19\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] M. L. Levin, S. M.
