DAVIS1\nAbstract. Given a profinite group G with finite virtual cohomological dimension, let {Xi } be a tower of discrete G-spectra, each of which is fibrant as a\nspectrum, so that X = holimi Xi is a continuous G-spectrum, with homotopy\nfixed point spectrum X hG . The E2 -term of the descent spectral sequence for\n\u03c0\u2217 (X hG ) cannot always be expressed as continuous cohomology. However, we\nshow that the E2 -term is always built out of a certain complex of spectra, that,\nin the context of abelian groups, is used to compute the continuous cochain\ncohomology of G with coefficients in limi Mi , where {Mi } is a tower of discrete\nG-modules.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this note, G always denotes a profinite group. Let Hc\u2217 (G; M ) denote the\ncontinuous cohomology of G with coefficients in the discrete G-module M . This\ncohomology is defined as the right derived functors of G-fixed points. Then we\nalways assume that G has finite virtual cohomological dimension; that is, there\nexists an open subgroup H and a non-negative integer m, such that Hcs (H; M ) = 0,\nfor all discrete H-modules M and all s \u2265 m.\nAll of our spectra are Bousfield-Friedlander spectra of simplicial sets. In particular, a discrete G-spectrum is a G-spectrum such that each simplicial set Xk is a\nsimplicial object in the category of discrete G-sets (thus, for any l \u2265 0, the action\nmap on the l-simplices, G \u00d7 (Xk )l \u2192 (Xk )l , is continuous when (Xk )l is regarded\nas a discrete space). The category of discrete G-spectra, with morphisms being\nG-equivariant maps of spectra, is denoted by SptG .\nDiscrete G-spectra are considered in more detail in [2], which shows (see [2,\nTheorem 3.6]) that SptG is a model category, where a morphism f in SptG is a\nweak equivalence (cofibration) if and only if f is a weak equivalence (cofibration) in\nSpt, the category of spectra. Given a discrete G-spectrum X, the homotopy fixed\npoint spectrum X hG is obtained as the total right derived functor of fixed points:\nX hG = (Xf,G )G , where X \u2192 Xf,G is a trivial cofibration and Xf,G is fibrant, all\nin SptG .\nLet X0 \u2190 X1 \u2190 X2 \u2190 * * * be a tower of discrete G-spectra, such that each Xi\nis a fibrant spectrum. As explained in [2, Lemma 4.4], there exists a tower {Xi\u2032 } of\ndiscrete G-spectra, such that there are weak equivalences\n\u2243\n\n\u2243\n\nholim Xi \u2212\u2192 holim Xi\u2032 \u2190\u2212 lim Xi\u2032 .\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nDate: June 21, 2006.\n1\nThe author was supported by an NSF grant. Most of this paper was written during a visit to\nthe Institut Mittag-Leffler (Djursholm, Sweden).\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDANIEL G. DAVIS\n\n(In this paper, holim always denotes the version of the homotopy limit of spectra\nthat is constructed levelwise in the category of simplicial sets, as defined in [1]\nand [10, 5.6].) Since the inverse limit of a tower of discrete G-sets is a topological\nG-space, and because holimi Xi can be identified with limi Xi\u2032 , in the eyes of homotopy, holimi Xi is a continuous G-spectrum. Notice that, under this identification,\nthe continuous G-action respects the topology of both G and all the Xi together.\nContinuous G-spectra and examples of such in chromatic stable homotopy theory\nare considered in [2].\nGiven the tower {Xi } and the continuous G-spectrum holimi Xi , its homotopy\nfixed point spectrum, (holimi Xi )hG , is defined to be holimi (Xi )hG . This construction is called homotopy fixed points because it is equivalent to the usual definition\nwhen G is a finite group and it is the total right derived functor of fixed points in\nthe appropriate sense (see [2, Remark 8.4]).\nBy [2, Theorem 8.8], thanks to the assumption of finite virtual cohomological\ndimension, there is a descent spectral sequence\n(1.1)\n\nE2s,t \u21d2 \u03c0t\u2212s ((holim Xi )hG ),\ni\n\nwhere\n(1.2)\n\nE2s,t = \u03c0 s \u03c0t (holim(\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G )\ni\n\n(see the beginning of Section 2 for the meaning of \u0393\u2022G ), and, if the tower of abelian\ngroups {\u03c0t (Xi )} satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition for every integer t, then E2s,t \u223c\n=\ns\n(G; {\u03c0t (Xi )}), which is continuous cohomology in the sense of Jannsen. (This\nHcont\ncohomology is obtained by taking the right derived functors of limi (\u2212)G , a functor\nfrom towers of discrete G-modules to abelian groups; see [7].)\nIn expression (1.2), since \u03c0t (holimi (\u2212)) is not necessarily limi \u03c0t (\u2212), the E2 -term\nof descent spectral sequence (1.1), in general, can not be expressed as continuous\ncohomology, and, in general, it has no compact algebraic description. For example,\nas pointed out in [2, Remark 8.10], when G = {e},\ns\nHcont\n({e}; {\u03c0t (Xi )}) = lim \u03c0t (Xi )\ni\n\nE20,t\n\nand\n= \u03c0t (holimi Xi ), and these need not be isomorphic, due to the familiar\nlim1 i \u03c0t+1 (Xi ) obstruction. However, in this note, we show that the E2 -term (1.2)\ncan always be described in an interesting way.\nIn more detail, Theorem 2.3 gives a particular cochain complex C \u2217 for computing\nthe continuous cochain cohomology of G for a topological G-module limi Mi , where\n{Mi } is a tower of discrete G-modules. In Corollary 4.4, we show that the E2 -term\nof (1.2) can always be given by taking the cohomology of the homotopy groups of\nthe complex C \u2217 , where limi Mi is replaced by the continuous G-spectrum holimi Xi ,\nin an appropriate sense. This presentation of the E2 -term shows that E2\u2217,\u2217 always\ntakes into account the topology of the continuous G-spectrum, even when it cannot\nbe expressed as continuous cohomology.\nSection 3 of this note consists of a discussion of the construction of descent\nspectral sequence (1.1). Section 5 explains why two other potentially plausible\ninterpretations of (1.2) fail to work.\n\n\fTHE E2 -TERM OF THE DESCENT SPECTRAL SEQUENCE\n\n3\n\nAcknowledgements. I am grateful to the referee for helpful comments and for\npointing out that the statement of the main result could be simplified. Also, I\nthank Paul Goerss and Halvard Fausk for useful remarks.\n2. The pro-discrete cochain complex and continuous cohomology\nWe begin this section with some terminology. If C is a category, then tow(C) is\nthe category of towers\nC0 \u2190 C1 \u2190 C2 \u2190 * * *\nin C. The morphisms {fi } are natural transformations such that each fi is a morphism in C. In this note, we will be working with tow(DMod(G)), where DMod(G)\nis the category of discrete G-modules, and tow(SptG ).\nIf A is an abelian group with the discrete topology, let Mapc (G, A) be the abelian\ngroup of continuous maps from G to A. If X is a spectrum, one can also define\nMapc (G, X), where the l-simplices of the kth simplicial set (Mapc (G, X)k )l are\ngiven by Mapc (G, (Xk )l ), where (Xk )l is given the discrete topology.\nConsider the functor\n\u0393G : SptG \u2192 SptG ,\n\nX 7\u2192 \u0393G (X) = Mapc (G, X),\n\nwhere the action of G on Mapc (G, X) is induced on the level of sets by (g * f )(g \u2032 ) =\nf (g \u2032 g), for g, g \u2032 \u2208 G and f \u2208 Mapc (G, (Xk )l ), for each k, l \u2265 0. As explained in [2,\nDefinition 7.1], the functor \u0393G forms a triple and there is a cosimplicial discrete\nG-spectrum \u0393\u2022G X. Also, it is clear that \u0393G : DMod(G) \u2192 DMod(G) can be defined\nas above, so that, given a discrete G-module M , \u0393\u2022G M is a cosimplicial discrete\nG-module.\nWe do not claim any originality in the following definition.\nDefinition 2.1. Let {Xi } be an object in tow(DMod(G)) or in tow(SptG ). Then\nthe pro-discrete cochain complex is defined to be the complex\nC \u2217 (G; {Xi }) = lim(\u0393\u2217G Xi )G ,\ni\n\nwhere \u0393\u2217G Xi is the canonical complex associated to \u0393\u2022G Xi , where, if {Xi } is in\ntow(SptG ), then the complex lives in the stable homotopy category. The prodiscrete cochain complex is a complex of abelian groups or spectra, respectively,\nand the limit and colimit are both formed in abelian groups or in spectra (not the\nstable homotopy category), respectively.\nLet M be any topological G-module (that is, an abelian Hausdorff topological\ngroup that is a G-module, with a continuous G-action). Then the continuous\n\u2217\n(G; M ), is the cohomology\ncochain cohomology of G with coefficients in M , Hcts\nof a cochain complex that has the form\n(2.2)\n\nM \u2192 Mapc (G, M ) \u2192 Mapc (G2 , M ) \u2192 * * *\n\n(see [9, pg. 106] for details). We note that, by [7, Theorem (2.2)], if {Mi } is a tower\nof discrete G-modules that satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then\nH s (G; lim Mi ) \u223c\n= H s (G; {Mi }),\ncts\n\ni\n\ncont\n\nfor all s \u2265 0, but, in general, these two versions of continuous cohomology need not\ns\nbe isomorphic. Also, if M is a discrete G-module, then Hcts\n(G; M ) = Hcs (G; M ).\nNow we show that the pro-discrete cochain complex can be used to compute\ncontinuous cochain cohomology.\n\n\f4\n\nDANIEL G. DAVIS\n\nTheorem 2.3. If {Mi } is a tower of discrete G-modules, then\nH s (G; lim Mi ) \u223c\n= H s [C \u2217 (G; {Mi })].\ncts\n\ni\n\nProof. As explained in [9, pg. 106], for a topological G-module M , the chain complex in (2.2) is defined by taking the G-fixed points of the complex\nX \u2217 (G; M ) = [Mapc (G, M ) \u2192 Mapc (G2 , M ) \u2192 * * * ],\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere X n (G; M ) = Mapc (Gn+1 , M ) has a G-action that is defined by\n(g * f )(g1 , ..., gn+1 ) = g * f (g \u22121 g1 , ..., g \u22121 gn+1 ).\nNow let M be a discrete G-module. Then it is a standard fact that the cochain\ncomplex (X \u2217 (G, M ))G is naturally isomorphic as a complex to the cochain complex\n(\u0393\u2217G M )G . This isomorphism uses the fact that the abelian group of n-cochains of\n(\u0393\u2217G M )G is isomorphic to Mapc (Gn+1 , M )G , where Mapc (Gn+1 , M ) has a G-action\nthat is given by\n(g * f )(g1 , g2 , g3 , ..., gn+1 ) = f (g1 g, g2 , g3 , ..., gn+1 ).\nSince\nG\n(X n (G; lim Mi ))G \u223c\n= lim((X n (G; Mi ))G ) \u223c\n= lim(\u0393n+1\nG Mi ) ,\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwe have:\ns\nHcts\n(G; lim Mi ) = H s [(X \u2217 (G; lim Mi ))G ] = H s [lim(\u0393\u2217G Mi )G ],\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2217\n\nG\n\nwhere we used the aforementioned fact that (X (G, Mi ))\nurally isomorphic cochain complexes.\n\nand (\u0393\u2217G Mi )G are nat\u0003\n\n3. Constructing the descent spectral sequence\nIn this section, we review how descent spectral sequence (1.1) is constructed\nand we compare it with a spectral sequence whose E2 -term is always Jannsen's\ncontinuous cohomology.\nGiven a tower {Xi } of discrete G-spectra, such that each Xi is a fibrant spectrum,\nby [2, Remark 7.8, Definition 8.1],\n(holim Xi )hG = holim holim(\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G .\ni\n\nThus,\n\ni\n\n\u2206\n\n(holim Xi )hG \u223c\n= holim(holim(\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G ),\ni\n\ni\n\n\u2206\n\nand descent spectral sequence (1.1) is the conditionally convergent homotopy spectral sequence\nlims \u03c0t (holim(\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G ) \u21d2 \u03c0t\u2212s (holim(holim(\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G ))\ni\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2206\n\ni\n\n(see [2, Theorem 8.8]).\nIn the above context, there is another spectral sequence that is natural to consider. Since\n(holim Xi )hG \u223c\n= holim(\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G ,\ni\n\n\u2206\u00d7{i}\n\nthere is a conditionally convergent homotopy spectral sequence\nlims \u03c0t ((\u0393\u2022 (Xi )f,G )G ) \u21d2 \u03c0t\u2212s (holim(\u0393\u2022 (Xi )f,G )G ) \u223c\n= \u03c0t\u2212s ((holim Xi )hG ),\n\u2206\u00d7{i}\n\nG\n\n\u2206\u00d7{i}\n\nG\n\ni\n\n\fTHE E2 -TERM OF THE DESCENT SPECTRAL SEQUENCE\n\nsuch that\n\n5\n\ns\n(G; {\u03c0t (Xi )})\nlims \u03c0t ((\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G ) \u223c\n= Hcont\n\n\u2206\u00d7{i}\n\n(see [5, Proposition 3.1.2]). This spectral sequence is closely related to the l-adic\ndescent spectral sequence of algebraic K-theory (see [10], [8]).\nWe see that we have two spectral sequences with abutment \u03c0\u2217 ((holimi Xi )hG ).\nAs pointed out in the Introduction, if the tower {\u03c0t (Xi )} satisfies the Mittag-Leffler\ncondition for every integer t, then the spectral sequences have isomorphic E2 -terms.\nHowever, as stated in the Introduction, the case G = {e} shows that these two\nspectral sequences can have different E2 -terms, so that the spectral sequences can\nbe different from each other.\nSince the second spectral sequence described above has an E2 -term that always\nhas a nice algebraic description, it is natural to ask what is the value of descent\nspectral sequence (1.1). We will see that, because the descent spectral sequence is\nthe homotopy spectral sequence of a cosimplicial spectrum, in certain cases it can\nbe compared with an Adams-type spectral sequence that is strongly convergent.\nLet n \u2265 1 and let p be a prime. Let K(n) be the nth Morava K-theory spectrum\nwith K(n)\u2217 = Fp [vn\u00b11 ], where the degree of vn is 2(pn \u2212 1). Also, let En denote the\nLubin-Tate spectrum, where En\u2217 = W (Fpn )[[u1 , ..., un\u22121 ]][u\u00b11 ], where the degree\nof u is \u22122, and the complete power series ring over the Witt vectors is in degree\nzero.\nLet Z be a K(n)-local spectrum and suppose that there is an augmentation\nZ \u2192 holimi (\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G . If the associated complex of spectra\n\u2217 \u2192 Z \u2192 holim Mapc (G, (Xi )f,G )G \u2192 holim Mapc (G, Mapc (G, (Xi )f,G ))G \u2192 * * *\ni\n\ni\n\nis a K(n)-local En -resolution of Z (for the definition of this, see [4, Appendix A]),\nthen descent spectral sequence (1.1) is isomorphic to the strongly convergent K(n)local En -Adams spectral sequence with abutment \u03c0\u2217 (Z) (see [4, Proposition A.5,\nCorollary A.8]). Thus, the descent spectral sequence is strongly convergent and the\nmap Z \u2192 holim\u2206 holimi (\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G \u223c\n= (holimi Xi )hG is a weak equivalence ([4,\nCorollary A.8]).\nIn this way, in [3, Chapter 10], the author showed that, given a finite spectrum X,\nthe descent spectral sequence for \u03c0\u2217 ((En \u2227X)hG ) is strongly convergent and isomorphic to the K(n)-local En -Adams spectral sequence with abutment \u03c0\u2217 (EndhG \u2227 X),\nwhere G is a closed subgroup of the extended Morava stabilizer group Gn and EndhG\nis the spectrum constructed by Devinatz and Hopkins in [4] (EndhG is denoted by\nEnhG in [4]).\n4. The E2 -term and the pro-discrete cochain complex\nIn this section, we show that the E2 -term of (1.2) can be built out of the same\ncomplex that computes continuous cochain cohomology. More precisely, given a\ncontinuous G-spectrum holimi Xi , there exists a tower {Xi\u2032 } of discrete G-spectra,\nsuch that\n(4.1)\nE s,t \u223c\n= H s [\u03c0t (C \u2217 (G; {X \u2032 }))].\n2\n\ni\n\nWe find the expression on the right-hand side in (4.1) interesting for the following\nreason. The homotopy fixed point spectrum is defined with respect to a continuous\naction of G on the spectrum. Thus, homotopy fixed points take into account the\n\n\f6\n\nDANIEL G. DAVIS\n\ntopology of the spectrum. Similarly, since the E2 -term is built out of the prodiscrete cochain complex of spectra, the E2 -term is always taking into account the\ntopology of the spectrum.\nBy [6, VI, Proposition 1.3], tow(SptG ) is a model category, where {fi } is a weak\nequivalence (cofibration) if and only if each fi is a weak equivalence (cofibration)\nin SptG .\nTheorem 4.2. The E2 -term (1.2) of descent spectral sequence (1.1) has the form\n(4.3)\nE s,t \u223c\n= \u03c0 s \u03c0t (lim(\u0393\u2022 X \u2032 )G ),\n2\n\nG\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere {Xi } \u2192 {Xi\u2032 } is a trivial cofibration with {Xi\u2032 } fibrant, all in tow(SptG ).\nProof. Let {Xi\u2032 } be as stated in the theorem. By [6, VI, Remark 1.5], each Xi\u2032 is\n\u2032\nfibrant and each map Xi\u2032 \u2192 Xi\u22121\nis a fibration, all in SptG .\nFor any k \u2265 0, we consider the expression\nholim((\u0393\u2022G Xi\u2032 )G )k = holim(Mapc (G, Mapc (G, * * * , Mapc (G, Xi\u2032 ) * * * )))G ,\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere Mapc (G, \u2212) appears k + 1 times. By [2, Section 3], the forgetful functor\nU : SptG \u2192 Spt, Mapc (G, \u2212) : Spt \u2192 SptG , where Mapc (G, X) = \u0393G (X), and\nthe functor (\u2212)G : SptG \u2192 Spt all preserve fibrations. Thus, {Xi\u2032 } is a tower of\nfibrations of fibrant spectra, all in Spt. This implies that {Mapc (G, Xi\u2032 )} is a tower\nof fibrations of fibrant spectra, in SptG , and hence, in Spt. By iteration,\n{Mapc (G, Mapc (G, * * * , Mapc (G, Xi\u2032 ) * * * ))}\nis a tower of fibrations of fibrant spectra, in SptG , so that\n{(Mapc (G, Mapc (G, * * * , Mapc (G, Xi\u2032 ) * * * )))G }\nis a tower of fibrations of fibrant spectra in Spt. Therefore, the canonical map\nlim((\u0393\u2022G Xi\u2032 )G )k \u2192 holim((\u0393\u2022G Xi\u2032 )G )k\ni\n\ni\n\nis a weak equivalence.\nSince {((\u0393\u2022G Xi )G )k } and {((\u0393\u2022G (Xi )f,G )G )k } are towers of fibrant spectra, there\nis a zigzag of weak equivalences\nlim((\u0393\u2022 Xi\u2032 )G )k \u2192 holim((\u0393\u2022 Xi\u2032 )G )k \u2190 holim((\u0393\u2022 Xi )G )k \u2192 holim((\u0393\u2022 (Xi )f,G )G )k ,\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere \u0393 = \u0393G . This zigzag of weak equivalences implies that\n\u03c0 s \u03c0t (lim((\u0393\u2022 X \u2032 )G )) \u223c\n= \u03c0 s \u03c0t (holim((\u0393\u2022 (Xi )f,G )G )).\ni\n\nG\n\ni\n\nG\n\ni\n\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.4. Let\n\n{Xi\u2032 }\n\nbe as in Theorem 4.2. Then there is an isomorphism\nE s,t \u223c\n= H s [\u03c0t (C \u2217 (G; {X \u2032 }))],\n2\n\nwhere\n\nE2s,t\n\ni\n\nis the E2 -term of (1.2).\n\ns\nRemark 4.5. By Theorem 2.3, H s [C \u2217 (G; {\u03c0t (Xi\u2032 )})] \u223c\n(G; limi \u03c0t (Xi )).\n= Hcts\n\n\fTHE E2 -TERM OF THE DESCENT SPECTRAL SEQUENCE\n\n7\n\n5. The failure of other possible descriptions of the E2 -term\nAfter studying the expression in (4.3) further, one recalls that limi (\u2212)G is the\ns\nfunctor used to define Hcont\n(G; \u2212), and, if M is any discrete G-module, then\n0 \u2192 M \u2192 \u0393\u2217G M\nis a (\u2212)G -acyclic resolution of M , so that H s [(\u0393\u2217G M )G ] = Hcs (G; M ).\nLet {Mi } be a tower of discrete G-modules. If\n{0} \u2192 {Mi } \u2192 {\u0393\u2217G Mi }\nis a limi (\u2212)G -acyclic resolution of {Mi } in tow(DMod(G)), then\ns\n(G; {Mi }).\nH s [(lim(\u2212)G )({\u0393\u2217G Mi })] = Hcont\ni\n\nThis would imply that E2s,t \u223c\n= H s [\u03c0t (limi (\u0393\u2217G Xi\u2032 )G )] is computed by taking the\ncohomology of the homotopy groups of a complex of spectra in the stable homotopy\ncategory, that, in the context of abelian groups, computes continuous cohomology.\nThis would be an interesting presentation of the E2 -term.\nHowever, it is not hard to show that\n{0} \u2192 {Mi } \u2192 {\u0393\u2217G Mi }\nneed not be a limi (\u2212)G -acyclic resolution of {Mi } in tow(DMod(G)), so that the\nabove interpretation of the E2 -term does not work out. For example, by [7, (2.1)],\nthere is a short exact sequence\ns\n(G; {\u0393G Mi }) \u2192 lim Hcs (G; \u0393G Mi ) \u2192 0,\n0 \u2192 lim1 Hcs\u22121 (G; \u0393G Mi ) \u2192 Hcont\ni\n\ni\n\nfor each s \u2265 0, where Hc\u22121 (G; \u2212) = 0. Therefore, when s \u2265 1, Hcs (G; \u0393G Mi ) = 0,\ns\n(G; {\u0393G Mi }) = 0. But, the short exact sequence also\nso that, for all s \u2265 2, Hcont\nimplies that\n1\nHcont\n(G; {\u0393G Mi }) \u223c\n= lim1 Mi ,\ni\n\nwhich need not vanish. Thus, {\u0393G Mi }, the first object in the complex {\u0393\u2217G Mi },\nneed not be limi (\u2212)G -acyclic in tow(DMod(G)).\nUpon further consideration of the expression in (4.3), one notices that, for any\nk, l, m \u2265 0,\n((lim(\u0393m+1 X \u2032 )G )k )l = lim(\u0393m+1 ((X \u2032 )k )l )G \u223c\n= Map (Gm , lim((X \u2032 )k )l )\ni\n\nG\n\ni\n\ni\n\nG\n\nc\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\nis an isomorphism of sets. If one could promote this isomorphism to\n(5.1)\nlim(\u0393m+1 X \u2032 )G \u223c\n= Map (Gm , lim X \u2032 ),\ni\n\nG\n\ni\n\nc\n\ni\n\ni\n\nthen one could use this to interpret the expression in (4.3) as being the cohomology\nof homotopy groups applied to the complex of continuous cochains with target\n(\"coefficients\") the continuous G-spectrum limi Xi\u2032 .\nBut notice that, in this interpretation, the expression Mapc (Gm , limi Xi\u2032 ) does\nnot have the desired meaning. For isomorphism (5.1) to hold, limi Xi\u2032 must be\na spectrum whose simplicial sets have simplices with the pro-discrete topology.\nBut, as a Bousfield-Friedlander spectrum, in the construction Mapc (Gm , limi Xi\u2032 ),\nlimi Xi\u2032 consists of simplicial sets whose simplices all have the discrete topology, by\ndefault. This conflict means that this interpretation also fails to work.\n\n\f8\n\nDANIEL G. DAVIS\n\nReferences\n1. A. K. Bousfield and D. M.
