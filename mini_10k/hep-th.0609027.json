( For a recent review, see Ref. [1]. )\nIn all these analyses, the basic formalism for the thermodynamical entropies is known as\nthe Wald's formalism which provides a general entropy formula, based on the first law of\nthermodynamics, in the presence any covariant combinations of the curvatures [2, 3, 4]. But,\nthere is a serious and well-known problem in this formalism: The second law of thermodynamics\nis not manifest, in contrast to the first law2 . However, it does not seem that this question has\nbeen well explored in the recent studies of supergravity black holes. Actually, without the\nguarantee of the second law, there would be no justification for identifying the entropies, even\nthough they satisfy the first law [5].\nMore recently, the corrections due to the gravitational Chern-Simons term [6, 7, 8] have been\nstudied in several different approaches, and it has been found that there are good agreements\nbetween the thermodynamical entropies based on the first law, and the statistical entropies\nbased on the boundary conformal field theories (CFT) [9, 10, 11, 12]. But, the agreements were\nnot perfect and there were some discrepancies in a strong coupling regime, though not been\nwell studied in the literatures.\nIn order to resolve the discrepancies I have re-considered the first law and argued that they\ncan be resolved by considering a new entropy formulae such as the second law is guaranteed\nfrom some new re-arrangements of the usual form of the first law [13, 14]. In this paper, I\nstudy general higher curvature corrections as well and show that there is similar discrepancies for a \"negative\" conformal factor (\u03a9\u0302 < 0), in which the thermodynamic entropy become\nnegative, which has been claimed \"unphysical\" in the literatures [15] or speculated as an indication of some thermodynamic instability [16, 17]. But, I argue that this can be resolved also\nby considering appropriate new entropy formulae, which being manifestly non-negative and\nsatisfying the second law, similarly to the case with the gravitational Chern-Simons. And, I\nshow that the new thermodynamical entropy agrees perfectly with the statistical entropy for\nall values of the conformal factor of the higher curvature terms and the coupling constant of\nthe gravitational Chern-Simons term. Here, the agreement with both the higher curvature and\ngravitational Chern-Simons corrections is not so trivial because the appropriate Hilbert spaces\nfor well-defined CFT are in conflict, but I find that this is actually possible in our case, due to\n2\n\nFor a class of higher curvature theories where the Lagrangian is a polynomial in the Ricci scalar R, the\nsecond law can be proved with the null (matter) energy condition and cosmic censorship. But, for other cases,\nthere has been no general proof.\n\n2\n\n\fa nice balancing of the two Hilbert spaces.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows.\nIn Sec. II, I consider the BTZ black hole in the presence of the generic, higher curvature\ncorrections, and I identify new entropies, which being manifestly non-negative, such as the\nsecond law of thermodynamics can be satisfied. The obtained entropy agrees with the usual\nWald's formula for the positive conformal factor \u03a9\u0302 > 0. However, it disagrees with the Wald's\nformula for \u03a9\u0302 < 0, which gives a negative entropy.\nIn Sec. III, I consider the statistical entropies and I find perfect agreements with the new\nthermodynamical entropies that have been found in Sec. II, even for the \u03a9\u0302 < 0 case as well as\nthe \u03a9\u0302 > 0 case.\nIn Sec. IV and V, I consider the gravitational Chern-Simons correction term as well, in\naddition to the generic higher curvature terms. I find perfect agreements between the thermodynamical and statistical entropies for \"all\" values (either \u03a9\u0302 > 0 or \u03a9\u0302 < 0) of the conformal\nfactor of the higher curvature terms and the coupling constant of the gravitational ChernSimons. The agreement with both of the two corrections is possible because of an appropriate\nbalancing of them, though it is not a trivial matter because of a conflict in the appropriate\nHilbert space for a well-defined CFT for each correction.\nIn Sec. VI, I conclude with several open questions.\nIn this paper, I shall keep the Newton's constant G and the Planck's constant h\u0304 in order\nto clearly distinguish the quantum gravity effects with the classical ones. But, I shall use the\nunits of c \u2261 1, kB \u2261 1, for the speed of light c and the Boltzman's constant kB for convenience,\nas usual.\n\nII.\n\nThe BTZ black hole with higher curvatures\n\nThe (2+1)-dimensional gravity with higher curvature terms and a (bare) cosmological constant \u039b = \u22121/l0 2 can be generally described by the action on a manifold M [ omitting some\nboundary terms ]\n1\nIg =\n16\u03c0G\n\nZ\n\nM\n\n\u221a\nd x \u2212g\n3\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\nf (g , R\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\u03bc ) +\n\n2\nl0 2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere f (g \u03bc\u03bd , R\u03bc\u03bd , \u2207\u03bc ) is an arbitrary scalar function constructed from the metric g \u03bc\u03bd , Ricci\ncurvature tensor R\u03bc\u03bd , and the covariant derivatives \u2207\u03bc [2, 3, 4]. This action is the most generic,\ndiffeomorphically invariant form in three dimensions since there is no independent component\nof the Riemann tensor due to vanishing Wely tensor. The equations of motion, by varying (2.1)\n\n3\n\n\fwith respect to the metric, are\n1\n1\n\u2202f\n\u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd f \u2212 2 g \u03bc\u03bd = t\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u2202g\u03bc\u03bd\n2\nl0\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere the pseudo-tensor t\u03bc\u03bd is given by\n1\nt\u03bc\u03bd = (\u2207\u03bd \u2207\u03b1 P\u03b1 \u03bc + \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03b1 P\u03b1 \u03bd \u2212 \u2737P \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b2 P\u03b1\u03b2 )\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith P\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 g\u03b1\u03bc g\u03b2\u03bd (\u2202f /\u2202R\u03bc\u03bd ).\nIn the absence of the higher curvature terms, there is a black hole solution, known as the\nBTZ ( Banados-Teitelboim-Zanelli ) solution, which is given by the metric [18]\nds2 = \u2212N 2 dt2 + N \u22122 dr 2 + r 2 (d\u03c6 + N \u03c6 dt)2\n\n(2.4)\n\nwith\nN2 =\n\n2\n2\n(r 2 \u2212 r+\n)(r 2 \u2212 r\u2212\n)\nr+ r\u2212\n, N\u03c6 = \u2212\n.\n2 2\nl0 r 2\nl0 r\n\n(2.5)\n\nHere, r+ and r\u2212 denote the outer and inner horizons, respectively. The mass and angular\nmomentum of the black hole are given by\n2\n2\n2r+ r\u2212\nr+\n+ r\u2212\nm=\n,\n2 , j =\n8Gl0\n8Gl0\n\n(2.6)\n\nrespectively. Note that these parameters satisfy the usual mass/angular momentum inequality\nm2 \u2265 j 2 /l0 2 in order that the horizon exists or the conical singularity is not naked, with the\nequality for an extremal black hole having the overlapping inner and outer horizons. This\nsatisfies the usual Einstein equation\n1\n1\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd R \u2212 2 g \u03bc\u03bd = 0\n2\nl0\n\n(2.7)\n\nwith a constant curvature scalar R = \u22126/l0 2 .\nBut, even in the presence of the generic higher curvature terms, the BTZ solution can be\nstill a solution since the local structure would be \"unchanged\" by higher curvatures. The only\neffects would be some \"re-normalization\" of the bare parameters l0 , r+ , and r\u2212 [9, 11, 12, 15]:\nThe renormalized cosmological constant will be denoted by3 \u039bren = \u22121/l2 and the function\nl = l(l0 ) depends on the details of the function f 4 ; however, I shall use the same notations r\u00b1\nIn the renormalized frame, one can also \"construct\" the Einstein equation R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 21 g \u03bc\u03bd R \u2212 l12 g \u03bc\u03bd = 0, as in\n(2.7), from the relations R\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = (R/6)(g\u03bc\u03b1 g\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03b2 g\u03bd\u03b1 ) and R = \u22126/l2.\n4\nFor f\u0012= R + aR2 + bR\u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd with\n\u0013 some appropriate coefficients a, b [15], the function l = l(l0 ) is given by\nq\n\u22122\n\u22122\n/(2(b \u2212 a)).\n\u22126l = \u22121 \u00b1 1 \u2212 24(b \u2212 a)l0\n3\n\n4\n\n\fin the renormalized frame also, for brevity. And, in this case one finds t\u03bc\u03bd = 0 trivially from\nP\u03b1\u03b2 \u221d g\u03b1\u03b2 for any constant-curvature solution [15]. On the other hand, the original mass and\nangular momentum, computed from the standard Hamiltonian approach [19, 3], become\nM = \u03a9\u0302m, J = \u03a9\u0302j,\n\n(2.8)\n\nrespectively, where the conformal factor \u03a9\u0302 is defined by\n\u2202f\n1\n,\n\u03a9\u0302 \u2261 g\u03bc\u03bd\n3\n\u2202R\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhich being constant for any constant-curvature solution [15]. Note that \u03a9\u0302 is \"not\" positive\ndefinite such as the usual inequality of the mass and angular momentum would not be valid\ngenerally5\nM \u2212 J/l = \u03a9\u0302(m \u2212 j/l),\n\n(2.10)\n\nbut it depends on the sign of \u03a9\u0302: For \u03a9\u0302 > 0 (case (i)) one has the usual inequality M \u2265 J/l;\nhowever, for \u03a9\u0302 < 0 (case (ii)), one has an anomalous inequality J/l \u2265 M with the \"negative\"\nM and J, though their magnitudes still satisfy the usual bound M 2 \u2265 J 2 /l2 .\nNow, by considering the first law of thermodynamics\n\u03b4M = \u03a9+ \u03b4J + T+ \u03b4SW ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nwith the Hawking temperature T+ and the angular velocity \u03a9+ of the (outer) event horizon r+\nT+ =\n\nh\u0304\u03ba\n2\u03c0\n\n=\nr+\n\n2\n2\nh\u0304(r+\n\u2212 r\u2212\n)\n, \u03a9+ = \u2212N \u03c6\n2\n2\u03c0l r+\n\nr+\n\n=\n\nr\u2212\nlr+\n\n(2.12)\n\nfor the surface gravity function\n\u03ba=\n\n1 \u2202N 2\n,\n2 \u2202r\n\n(2.13)\n\nthe black hole entropy can be identified as\nSW = \u03a9\u0302\n\n2\u03c0r+\n.\n4Gh\u0304\n\n(2.14)\n\nThis agrees with the Wald's entropy formula [15], and this should be the case since the entropy\nin the Wald's formalism is basically defined by the first law of thermodynamics [4]. But, I\n5\n\nHere, m and j represent the usual mass and angular momentum for the metric (2.4) in the renormalized\nr 2 +r 2\n\nframe m = +8Gl2\u2212 , j =\nm \u2212 j/l \u2265 0 still.\n\n2r+ r\u2212\n8Gl ,\n\nwith the renormalized parameters l, r\u00b1 , such as one has the usual inequality\n\n5\n\n\fmust note that the first law can not be \"proved\" without knowing the form of the entropy\nand temperature, basically. Actually, in the case of black holes, we usually know the Hawking\ntemperature, as in (2.12), from the Hawking radiation analysis with a given, Riemanian6,\nmetric and so we can identify the entropy, by \"assuming\" the first law. This is a basic process\nto compute the entropy in the general class of gravity theories (see, for example, Refs. [3, 4]).\nHowever, a basic problem of this approach is that the second law is not guaranteed, in\ngeneral. Actually, in the higher derivative gravity theories there would be deep changes in the\nentropy, and the second law or the Hawking's area (increasing) theorem has to be revisited\ncompletely, generally. But, in regards to the area theorem, this is \"not\" true in our case: Our\nspace is maximally symmetric, i.e., a constant curvature space, and so the higher curvature\neffects to the energy momentum tensor, t\u03bc\u03bd of (2.3) vanishes, as I have clearly noted in the\nparagraph below (2.7). Other higher curvature effects in the Einstein equation (2.2) from the\narbitrary function f , give only some re-normalization of the bare parameters l0 , r+ , r\u2212 , as I have\nexplained in the same paragraph, such as the resulting equation be just the original vacuum\nEinstein equation (2.7) with the parameters' re-normalization7 . So, as far as the area theorem\nfor the outer horizons is concerned, the usual derivations via the Raychaudhuri's equation with\nthe null energy condition for matter's energy-momentum tensor still works in our case since\nthe vacuum Einstein equation satisfies the null-energy condition, trivially [20]. Moreover, there\nis another approach, called the \"physical process\" [21, 4]), to prove the area theorem which\ndoes not depends on the details of the gravity [2]. It depends only on the first law with an\nappropriate energy condition, and the area law is evident, in this approach, from the first law\n(2.11) also. (For the details, see Ref. [22].) Hence, it is clear that the entropy formula (2.14)\nsatisfies the second law, for the case of \u03a9\u0302 > 0, since it is already in the Bekenstein's form,\nwhich being proportional to the area of the outer horizon A+ = 2\u03c0r+ , such as the Hawking's\narea (increasing) theorem implies the increasing entropy [23].\nOn the other hand, the situation is quite different for \u03a9\u0302 < 08 since (2.14) would not guarantee\nthe second law nor the positiveness because it would \"decrease\" indefinitely, with the negative\nvalues, as the outer horizon r+ be increased, from the area theorem. Actually, this seems to be\ngeneral feature of higher derivative gravities in arbitrary dimensions [24, 16, 25, 17] or Taub-Bolt\nspacetime with a cosmological constant [17, 26], and in the literatures it has been speculated\n6\n\nFor some non-Riemanian geometry, it seems that a different Hawking temperature could occur. See Ref.\n[20] for this possibility.\n7\nThere are an explicit comment about this in the literature (see the footnote 2 in Ref. [12]) and an explicit\ncomputation also (see the Example in Sec.3.4 in Ref. [15]); and see also the two footnotes 3 and 4, in this paper,\nabout this. This has been also discussed more explicitly in Ref. [20].\n8\nNote that our theory with the negative conformal factor does not affect the causal strcture in the Einstein\nframe either since the (three-dimensional) frame transformation \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = \u03a9\u03022 g\u03bc\u03bd is insensitive to the sign of \u03a9\u0302\n[4, 15].\n\n6\n\n\fas an indication of some thermodynamic instability (for example, see Refs. [16, 17]). But, this\nseems to be physically nonsensical since the entropy is non-negative, \"by its definition\" as a\nmeasure of disorderedness [27]; the positiveness of the entropy is a \"minimum\" requirement\nthat must be satisfied if the entropy has a statistical mechanical origin [4]. Moreover, without\nthe guarantee of the second law, there would be no justification for identifying the entropies,\neven though they satisfy the first law [5]. So, in this paper I consider a different approach which\ncan resolve the two problems, simultaneously. The new resolution is to consider an entropy\nSW \u2032 = |\u03a9\u0302|\n\n2\u03c0r+\n,\n4Gh\u0304\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhich is non-negative manifestly and also satisfying the second law from the area theorem9 ,\nas in the case of SW in (2.14) for a positive \u03a9\u0302. But, in this case I must pay the price, by\nconsidering a new temperature\nT+ \u2032 \u2261 \u2212T+ ,\n\n(2.16)\n\ninstead of T+ , in order to satisfy the first law also.\nIn the following sections, I will show that the new approach is actually what favored by\nthe statistical entropy through a CFT analysis, which provides the new entropy formula (2.15)\ndirectly: With the correct values of M, J, and the entropy SW \u2032 , which is non-negative and\nproportional to the (outer) horizon area, there is no other choice in the temperature.\n\nIII.\n\nStatistical entropy\n\nIt is well known that, in the absence of the higher curvature terms, the statistical entropy\nof the BTZ black hole can be computed from a two-dimensional CFT, which is described\nby Virasoro algebras, on the asymptotic Anti-de Sitter (AdS) boundary with the help of the\nCardy formula, and there is a complete agreement with the thermodynamical BekensteinHawking entropy. There are basically two approaches to compute the CFT, i.e., the Virasoro\nalgebras. One approach is a quantum approach which identifies the central charges of the\nCFT, in the context of the conjectured AdS/CFT correspondence [28], by evaluating the\nanomalies of the CFT effective action on the AdS boundary, from the regularized bulk gravity\naction [29, 30, 31]. The other approach is a classical one which directtly computes (classical)\nVirasoro algebras based on the classical symmetry algebras of the asymptotic isometry of AdS3\n[32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. It is widely known that these two approaches agree completely, and this\nprovides an explicit check of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n9\n\nThe physical process version of the second law for this definition or the area theorem is related to the same\ngeometric effect as that of the \u03a9\u0302 > 0 case. (See Ref. [22] for the details.)\n\n7\n\n\fRecently, these analyses have been generalized to the theories with higher curvature terms,\nand some good agreements were known between the thermodynamical and statistical entropies,\nas well as the agreements between the holographic anomaly approach and classical symmetry\nalgebra approach. But, in contrast to the usual claims in the literatures, these analyses have\nsome problems which \"might\" invalidate the AdS/CFT correspondence. First, there are some\ndiscrepancies in the usual thermodynamical and statistical entropies, though this has not been\nwell explored in the literatures [15, 9, 12]. Second, the computation about the classical symmetry algebra, by transforming a gravity action with the higher curvature terms into the usual\nEinstein-Hilbert action with some auxiliary tensor matter fields, \"might\" have some problems\nsince there would be some non-trivial, boundary contributions in the Virasoro generators L\u0302\u00b1\nm\nand central charges from the matter fields \"in general\" [37, 38, 39], in contrast to the work [15],\nthough the agreements seems to be plausible in the context of AdS/CFT. In this paper, the\nsecond problem will not be discussed further and left as an open problem. In the remainder\nof this paper, I will concentrate only the first problem and in the context of the quantum approach of the \"holographic anomalies\", which has been computed rigorously recently, such as\nthe second problem does not occur, in contrast to Ref. [15].\nNow, in order to discuss the first problem in detail, I start by noting the holographic\n(conformal) anomalies in the expectation values of the boundary stress tensor [9], for a boundary\nmetric ds2 \u2243 \u2212r 2 dx+ dx\u2212 with r taken to infinity,\nD\n\nE\n\nT++ (x+ ) = \u2212\n\nE\nh\u0304\u0109\u2212\nh\u0304\u0109+ D\n, T\u2212\u2212 (x+ ) = \u2212\n24\u03c0\n24\u03c0\n\n(3.1)\n\nwith the central charges [40, 9][ I follow the conventions of Ref.

In the absence of the higher curvature\nterms, this reduces to the usual result for the holographic conformal anomaly of AdS3 from\n\u03a9\u0302 = 1 [29, 30, 31], whereas higher curvature terms produce the departures from the unity, i.e.,\n\u03a9\u0302 \u2212 1, which can be either positive or negative, depending on the coupling constants of the\nhigher curvature terms.\nThen, let me consider the ground state Virasoro generators, expressed in terms of the black\nhole's mass and angular momentum:\nlM \u00b1 J \u0109\u00b1\n+\n2h\u0304\n24\n(lm \u00b1 j) \u0109\u00b1\n= \u03a9\u0302\u00b1\n+ .\n2h\u0304\n24\n\n=\nL\u0302\u00b1\n0\n\n(3.6)\n\nWith the Virasoro algebras of L\u0302\u00b1\nm in the standard form, which are defined on the plane, one\ncan use the Cardy formula for the asymptotic states [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]\n\u02c6 \u00b1) \u2243\nlog \u03c1(\u2206\n\nv\nu \u0010\nu1\n2\u03c0 t \u0109\u00b1\n\n6\n\n\u02c6\u00b1\n\u2212 24\u2206\nmin\n\n\u0011\n\n!\n\n\u00b1\n\u02c6 \u00b1 \u2212 \u0109 ,\n\u2206\n24\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u02c6 \u00b1 are the eigenvalues, called conformal weights, of the operator L\u03020 for black-hole\nwhere \u2206\n\u02c6 \u00b1 i and \u2206\n\u02c6\u00b1\nquantum states |\u2206\nmin are their minimum values.

Note that the correct \"1/h\u0304\" factor for the semiclassical black hole entropy\ncomes from the appropriate recovering of h\u0304 in (3.2) and (3.6). According to the conditions of\nvalidity (3.8) and (3.9), this entropy formula is valid only when both of the two conditions\n(r+ \u00b1 r\u2212 ) \u226b l,\n\n(r+ \u00b1 r\u2212 ) \u226b h\u0304G\n\n(3.12)\n(3.13)\n\nare satisfied. The usual semiclassical limit of large black hole (area), in which the back-reaction\nof the emitted radiation from the black hole is neglected [47, 48] and so the thermodynamical\nentropy formula (2.14) and (2.15) from the first law can be reliable, agrees with the condition\n(3.13). The condition (3.12) provides one more restriction on the black hole systems, though this\ndoes not seem to be needed, in general. But, at this stage, the condition of large central charges\n\u0109\u00b1 \u226b 1, i.e., l \u226b h\u0304G [46], which would be related to the leading supergravity approximation\nof AdS/CFT correspondence [28], is not needed yet. It is interesting to note also that the\nstatistical entropy (3.10) from the Cardy formula (3.7) has basically the same form for both\nthe Einstein-Hilbert action and the higher curvature corrected action; the only changes are\nsome correction terms in the central charges and the conformal weights themselves, rather than\nconsidering the higher order corrections to the Cardy formula itself ! This is because the higher\ncurvature terms do not necessarily imply the quantum corrections, such as even the higher\ncurvature terms can be treated semiclassically by neglecting the back reaction effects, which\nare quantum effects, and so (3.9) or (3.13) can be satisfied [14].\nNow, let me consider the following two cases, depending on the signs of \u03a9\u0302: (i). \u03a9\u0302 \u2265 0 and\n(ii). \u03a9\u0302 < 0.\n\n10\n\n\f(i). \u03a9\u0302 \u2265 0: In this case, I have |\u03a9\u0302| = \u03a9\u0302 and the statistical entropy (3.10) becomes\nSstat = \u03a9\u0302\n\n2\u03c0r+\n.\n4Gh\u0304\n\n(3.14)\n\nThis agrees exactly with the usual Wald's entropy formula (2.14), as was known also in the\n\u02c6 \u00b1 \u2212 \u0109\u00b1 /24 are positive definite such\nliteratures [9, 12, 15]. And, this is the case where \u0109\u00b1 and \u2206\nas the Cardy formula (3.7) has a well-defined meaning. In the gravity side also it shows the\nusual behavior with the \"positive\" mass and angular momentum satisfying the normal inequality M \u2265 J/l, as well as M 2 \u2265 J 2 /l2 .\n(ii). \u03a9\u0302 < 0: In this case, I have |\u03a9\u0302| = \u2212\u03a9\u0302 and so the statistical entropy (3.10) becomes\nSstat = \u2212\u03a9\u0302\n\n2\u03c0r+\n.\n4Gh\u0304\n\n(3.15)\n\nThis agrees exactly with the modified entropy formula (2.15), which is manifestly positive and\nguarantees the second law of thermodynamics, even in this case. But, this can not agree with\nthe usual Wald's formula (2.14), giving a negative entropy, though this has not been wellexplored in the literatures10 ; this discrepancy can be only resolved in the modified entropy\nformula (2.15). And, this is the case where there is an abnormal mass bound due to M \u2264 J/l\nwith negative M and J. Moreover, in the CFT side also, this is not the usual system either\n\u02c6 \u00b1 \u2212 \u0109\u00b1 /24 = \u03a9\u0302(ml \u2212 j)/2h\u0304 are negative valued, but the CFT\nbecause \u0109\u00b1 = \u03a9\u0302(3l/2Gh\u0304) and \u2206\nis perfectly well defined. The application of the Cardy formula to the case of negative \u0109\u00b1 and\n\u02c6 \u00b1 \u2212 \u0109\u00b1 /24 might be questioned due to the existence of negatives-norm states with the usual\n\u2206\nE\nE\n\u02c6 \u00b1 . However, this problem\n\u02c6 \u00b1 = 0 (n > 0) for the highest-weight state |\u2206\ncondition L\u0302\u00b1\nn |\u2206\ncan be easily cured, though not quite well-known, by considering another representation of\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n \u0303\u00b1\nthe Virasoro algebras with L\u0303\u00b1\n\u2261 \u2212\u0109\u00b1 and L\u0303\u00b1\nn \u2261 \u2212L\u0302\u2212n , c\u0303\nn |\u2206 i = 0 (n > 0) for the new\n \u0303 \u00b1 i [49, 13, 14]; this implies that the Hilbert space need to be \"twisted\"\nhighest-weight state |\u2206\nin which\ntheE whole states vectors be constructed from the doubly-twisted highest-weight state\nE\n+\n \u0303\n \u0303\n|\u2206 \u2297 |\u2206\u2212 . The formula (3.10), which is invariant under this substitution\u2013actually their selfcompensations of the negative signs produce the real and positive statistical entropy, should\nbe understood in this context.\nIn summary, I have found exact agreements between the new thermodynamic black hole entropies which are manifestly non-negative, satisfying the second law, and have been evaluated\nin the bulk (AdS) gravity side and the CFT entropies in the asymptotic boundary, for any\nvalue of the conformal factor \u03a9\u0302 of higher curvature gravities. So, the modified entropy formula\n10\n\nThe errors in Ref.

The BTZ solution (2.4), (2.5) satisfies the\nsame equations of motion as (2.7) from C \u03bc\u03bd = 0, like as t\u03bc\u03bd = 0, for any constant curvature\nsolution, and of course with the renormalized parameters l, r+ , and r\u2212 .\n11\n\nNote that the dimensioless coupling constant \u03b2\u0302 is related to the one used in Refs. [6, 7, 8] as \u03b2\u0302 = \u22121/(\u03bcl0 ),\nin Ref. [11] as \u03b2\u0302 = \u2212\u03b2S /l0 , and in Ref.

Here, (\u03a9\u0302 \u2212 1)-factors came from the higher curvature corrections of (2.8) and\n\u03b2\u0302-factors came from the gravitational Chern-Simons corrections of (4.5). In contrast to the\ncase with the higher curvature corrections only, the usual inequalities of the mass and angular\nmomentum are not generally valid,\n!\n\n\u03b2\u0302\n(m \u2212 j/l),\nMtot \u2212 Jtot /l = \u03a9\u0302 1 \u2212\n\u03a9\u0302\n!\n\u03b2\u0302 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nMtot \u2212 Jtot /l = \u03a9\u0302 1 \u2212\n(m2 \u2212 j 2 /l2 )\n2\n\u03a9\u0302\n\n(4.8)\n\nbut depends on the values of the ratio, \u03b7\u0302 \u2261 \u03b2\u0302/\u03a9\u0302: For small values of ratio, |\u03b7| < 1, the usual\n2\n2\ninequality in magnitudes is preserved, i.e., Mtot\n\u2265 Jtot\n/l2 ; however, for the large values of ratio,\n|\u03b7| > 1, one has an anomalous inequality with an exchanged role of the mass and angular\n2\n2\nmomentum as Jtot\n/l2 \u2265 Mtot\n; also, at the critical value |\u03b7| = 1, the modified mass and angular\n2\n2\nmomentum are \"always\" saturated, i.e., Mtot\n= Jtot\n/l2 , regardless of inequality of the bare\nparameters m,j and the signs of \u03a9\u0302. But, the inequality for Mtot and Jtot depends on the sign\nof \u03a9\u0302, also.\nNow, by considering the first law of thermodynamics as\n\u03b4Mtot = \u03a9+ \u03b4Jtot + T+ \u03b4SW (tot)\n\n(4.9)\n\nwith the temperature T+ and angular velocity \u03a9+ of the outer horizon r+ , the total entropy\ncan be identified as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0r\u2212\n2\u03c0r+\n.\n(4.10)\n+ \u03b7\u0302\nSW (tot) = \u03a9\u0302\n4Gh\u0304\n4Gh\u0304\n12\n\nThis has been checked in several different approaches, e.g., the quasi-local method's in Ref. [50], the\nsuper-angular momentum's in Ref. [51], the ADM's in Refs. [52, 53], the holography's in Refs. [10, 11].\n\n13\n\n\fThis agrees with the Wald's entropy formula [12], as it should be. But, as I have argued for the\ngravitational Chern-Simons corrected case in the recent works [13, 14] and in Sec. II for the\nhigher- curvature corrected case, the positiveness nor the second law of thermodynamics would\nnot be guaranteed by the entropy (4.10), generally. Especially for the gravitational ChernSimons correction term in (4.10), being proportional to the inner-horizon area A\u2212 = 2\u03c0r\u2212 ,\nthere is no guarantee of the second law due to lack of area (increasing) theorem for the inner\nhorizon; rather, it seems like that this would rather decrease due to the instability of the inner\nhorizon [54, 55]. The only way of guaranteeing the second law from the entropy (4.10) is to\nconsider an appropriate balancing of \u03a9\u0302 and \u03b2\u0302 such as the contributions from the area of the\nouter-horizon area A+ = 2\u03c0r+ dominate those from A\u2212 : Since r+ \u2265 r\u2212 is always satisfied,\nthis condition is equivalent to |\u03b7\u0302| < 1 with \u03a9\u0302 > 0. Actually, this is the case where the usual\nmass/angular momentum inequalities hold from (4.6)\u223c(4.8) and the system behaves as an\nordinary BTZ black hole, though there are some shifts and conformal factor corrections in the\nmass, angular momentum, and entropy [12].\nOn the other hand, for the other values of \u03a9\u0302 and \u03b7\u0302, the entropy of (4.10) does not guarantee\nthe positiveness nor the second law, and I need some different forms of the entropy. There are,\nincluding the above ordinary case, totally 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 possible cases from 2 possibilities for \u03a9\u0302\n( \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03a9\u0302 < 0 ) and 3 possibilities for \u03b7\u0302 ( |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1, \u03b7 > 1, \u03b7 < \u22121 ). Let me consider the\nfollowing five cases, in addition to the case of (a). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1 for the ordinary black holes\nabove, depending on the values of \u03a9\u0302 and \u03b7\u0302: (b). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03b7\u0302 > 1, (c). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03b7\u0302 < \u22121, (d). \u03a9\u0302 < 0,\n|\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1, (e). \u03a9\u0302 < 0, \u03b7\u0302 > 1, and (f). \u03a9\u0302 < 0, \u03b7\u0302 < \u22121.\n(b). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03b7\u0302 > 1: In order to study this case, I first note the following identity in the BTZ\nsystem [13, 14]\n\u03b4m = \u03a9+ \u03b4j + T+ \u03b4SBH\n\n(4.11)\n\n= \u03a9\u2212 \u03b4j + T\u2212 \u03b4S\u2212\n\n(4.12)\n\nwith the temperature T\u2212 and angular velocity \u03a9\u2212 of the inner horizon r\u2212\nh\u0304\u03ba\nT\u2212 =\n2\u03c0\n\nr\u2212\n\n2\n2\nh\u0304(r\u2212\n\u2212 r+\n)\n=\n, \u03a9\u2212 = \u2212N \u03c6\n2\n2\u03c0l r\u2212\n\nr\u2212\n\n=\n\nr+\nlr\u2212\n\n(4.13)\n\nand the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\nSBH =\n\n2\u03c0r+\n.\n4Gh\u0304\n\n(4.14)\n\nHere, the physical relevances of the parameters T\u2212 and \u03a9\u2212 are not clear. But, here and below,\nI use T\u2212 , \u03a9\u2212 just for convenience in identifying the new entropy, from the \"assumed\" first law\n14\n\n\fof thermodynamics (4.12).13\nNow, let me consider, from (4.6) and (4.7),\n\u03b4Mtot \u2212 \u03a9\u2212 \u03b4Jtot = \u03a9\u0302 [\u03b4m \u2212 \u03a9\u2212 \u03b4j + \u03b7\u0302(\u03b4j/l \u2212 \u03a9\u2212 \u03b4m)] ,\n\n(4.15)\n\ninstead of \u03b4Mtot \u2212 \u03a9+ \u03b4Jtot in (4.9). Then, it is easy to see that the first two terms in the right\nhand side become T\u2212 \u03b4S\u2212 by using the second identity (4.12). And also, the final two terms in\nthe bracket become T\u2212 \u03b4SBH by using the first identity (4.11) and another identity\n\u22122\n\u03a9\u2212 = \u03a9\u22121\n+ l .\n\n(4.16)\n\nSo, finally I find that (4.15) becomes a new re-arrangement of the first law as\n\u03b4Mtot = \u03a9\u2212 \u03b4Jtot + T\u2212 \u03b4Snew\n\n(4.17)\n\nwith a new black hole entropy\n2\u03c0r+\n2\u03c0r\u2212\n.\n(4.18)\n+ \u03b7\u0302\n4Gh\u0304\n4Gh\u0304\nWith the new entropy formula, it is easy to see the previous argument for the second law of\nthermodynamics of (4.10) in the small values of coupling as |\u03b7\u0302| < 1, with \u03a9\u0302 > 0, can now be\napplied to that of (4.18) in the large values of coupling as |\u03b7\u0302| > 1.\nSnew = \u03a9\u0302\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(c). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03b7\u0302 < \u22121: In this case, the entropy formula (4.18) would not guarantee the second\nlaw of thermodynamics nor the positiveness of the entropy: The entropy would \"decrease\"\nindefinitely, with the negative values, as the outer horizon r+ be increased from the Hawking's\narea theorem [23]. But, there is a simple way of resolution from the new form of the first law\n(4.17), as in the case of \u03a9\u0302 < 0 with the higher curvature terms only in Sec. II.

This agrees exactly with the usual entropy formula\n(4.10), which agrees with the Wald's formula also [12]. And, this is the case where \u0109\u00b1\ntot and\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u02c6 tot \u2212 \u0109tot /24 are positive definite such as the Cardy formula (3.7) has a well-defined meaning.\n\u2206\nIn the gravity side also it shows the usual behavior with the \"positive\" mass and angular mo2\n2\nmentum, satisfying the normal inequality Mtot\n\u2265 Jtot\n/l2 .\n(b). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03b7\u0302 > 1 or \u03a9\u0302 < 0, \u03b7\u0302 < \u22121: In this case, I have |\u03b3\u0302 + | = \u03b3\u0302 + , |\u03b3\u0302 \u2212 | = \u2212\u03b3\u0302 \u2212 and so the\nstatistical entropy (5.5) becomes\nSstat(tot) = \u03a9\u0302\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0r+\n2\u03c0r\u2212\n+ \u03b7\u0302\n4Gh\u0304\n4Gh\u0304\n17\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(5.8)\n\n\fThis agrees exactly with the new entropy formula (4.18), which guarantees the second law of\nthermodynamics in this case.

Moreover, in the CFT side also, this is not the usual system either\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u02c6\u2212\nbecause \u0109\u2212\ntot = \u03b3\u0302 3l/(2Gh\u0304) and \u2206tot \u2212 \u0109tot /24 = \u03b3\u0302tot (ml \u2212 j)/2h\u0304 are negative valued, though\ntheir self-compensations of the negative signs produce the real and positive statistical entropy.\nHowever, the CFT is perfectly well defined, as I have discussed in the case (ii) of Sec. III, by\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nconsidering another representation of the Virasoro algebra with L\u0303\u2212\nn(tot) \u2261 \u2212L\u0302\u2212n(tot) , c\u0303tot \u2261 \u2212\u0109tot\n \u0303\u2212\n \u0303\u2212\nand L\u0303\u2212\nn(tot) |\u2206tot i = 0 (n > 0) for a new highest-weight state |\u2206tot i [13, 14]; this implies that\nthe Hilbert space need to be \"twisted\"\nin which\nthe whole states vectors be constructed from\nE\nE\n+\n\u2212\n\u02c6 tot \u2297 |\u2206\n \u0303 tot , in contrast to the double twistings for the case\nthe twisted highest-weight state |\u2206\n(ii) of Sec. III. The formula (5.5), which is invariant under this substitution, should be understood in this context. On the other hand, if I take the limit \u03b7\u0302 \u2192 \u221e, this becomes the \"exotic\"\nblack hole system that occurs in several different contexts [56, 57, 58, 59, 13]. Interestingly,\nthis includes the limiting case of \u03a9\u0302 \u2192 0 with any finite, non-vanishing \u03b2\u0302 = \u03a9\u0302\u03b7\u0302, as well as the\ncase of \u03b2\u0302 \u2192 \u221e, with the finite \u03a9\u0302, in which there is only the gravitational Chern-Simons term,\nwithout the Einstein-Hilbert and its higher curvature corrections,\n(c). \u03a9\u0302 > 0, \u03b7\u0302 < \u22121 or \u03a9\u0302 < 0, \u03b7\u0302 > 1: In this case, I have |\u03b3\u0302 + | = \u2212\u03b3\u0302 + , |\u03b3\u0302 \u2212 | = \u03b3\u0302 \u2212 and the\nstatistical entropy (5.5) becomes\nSstat(tot) = \u2212\u03a9\u0302\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0r+\n2\u03c0r\u2212\n+ \u03b7\u0302\n4Gh\u0304\n4Gh\u0304\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(5.9)\n\nNote that this is positive definite and this should be the case due to the definition Sstat(tot) =\n\u02c6+\n\u02c6\u2212\n\u02c6\u00b1\nlog(\u03c1(\u2206\ntot )\u03c1(\u2206tot )) \u2265 0 for the number of states \u03c1(\u2206tot ) \u2265 1. This agrees exactly with the\nmodified new entropy formula (4.19), which guarantees the second law. And this is the case\nwhere Mtot can be negative and Jtot has the opposite direction to the bare one j, in contrast\nto the positive definite Mtot and Jtot in the cases of (a) and (b), as well as the anomalous\n+\n2\n2\n\u02c6+\ninequality Jtot\n/l2 \u2265 Mtot\n. In the CFT side, \u0109+\ntot and \u2206tot \u2212 \u0109tot /24 become negative-valued now,\nand I need to twist this right-moving sector, rather than the left-moving one as in the case (b),\n+\n+\n+\n+\n \u0303+\nL\u0303+\nn(tot) \u2261 \u2212EL\u0302\u2212n(tot) , Ec\u0303tot \u2261 \u2212\u0109tot and L\u0303n(tot) |\u2206tot i = 0 (n > 0) for the twisted highest-weight\n \u0303+\n\u02c6\u2212\nstate |\u2206\ntot \u2297 |\u2206tot .\n(d). \u03a9\u0302 < 0, |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1: In this case, I have |\u03b3\u0302 \u00b1 | = \u2212\u03b3\u0302 \u00b1 and the statistical entropy (5.5)\nbecomes\nSstat(tot) = \u2212\u03a9\u0302\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0r\u2212\n2\u03c0r+\n+ \u03b7\u0302\n4Gh\u0304\n4Gh\u0304\n18\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(5.10)\n\n\fThis agrees exactly with the modified entropy formula (4.21), which is positive definite and\nguarantees the second law as well as the first law. This case is exactly the same situation as in\nthe case (ii) of Sec. III, and there is the upper bound for the mass, i.e., Mtot \u2264 Jtot /l \u2264 0, though\n2\n2\none has the usual inequality in the magnitudes Mtot\n\u2265 Jtot\n/l2 . And, in contrast to the above (b),\n \u0303+\n \u0303+\n(c) cases, I need the doubly-twisted highest-weight state |\u2206\ntot i \u2297 |\u2206tot i with the new presenta\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n \u0303\u00b1\ntion of the Virasoro algebras for L\u0303\u00b1\nn(tot) \u2261 \u2212L\u0302\u2212n(tot) , c\u0303tot \u2261 \u2212\u0109tot , and L\u0303n(tot) |\u2206tot i = 0 (n > 0).\nIt is interesting to note that I have perfectly well-defined CFT for all the possible cases and\nthere are no conflicts, in the general theory of (4.1), between the \"single\" twisting of the Hilbert\nspace with the gravitational Chern-Simons of Sec.III and the \"double\" twistings with the higher\ncurvatures [13, 14] : They are well self-organized such as the negative norm states do not occur.\nIn summary, I have found exact agreements between the new thermodynamical black hole\nentropies for the bulk (AdS) gravity with the gravitational Chern-Simons as well as the general\nhigher curvature terms and the CFT entropies in the asymptotic boundary, for all values of\nthe coupling \u03b7\u0302 and the conformal factor \u03a9\u0302. It is remarkable that CFT has no conflict, for the\ngeneral theory with both the higher curvature and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, between\nthe single twisting of the Hilbert space for the gravitational Chern-Simons term and double\ntwisting for the higher curvatures such as the CFT can be well-defined for all cases, though\nthis is not so clear at first. So, the new entropy formulae for the strong coupling |\u03b7\u0302| > 1, either\n\u03a9\u0302 > 0 or \u03a9\u0302 < 0 and the modified entropy formula for \u03a9\u0302 < 0, |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1 seem to be supported\nby the CFT approach also. This reveals the AdS/CFT correspondence in the sub-leading orders with the \"all\" higher curvature terms and the higher derivative term of the gravitational\nChern-Simons, as well as in the leading order with the Einstein-Hilbert action.\n\nVI.\n\nSummary and open problems\n\nI have studied the thermodynamics of the BTZ black hole in the presence of all the higher\ncurvature terms and a gravitational Chern-Simons term, and its solid connection with a statistical approach, based on the holographic anomalies.\nThe main results are as follows:\nFirst, for the case of a large coupling |\u03b7\u0302| > 1, with any value of \u03a9\u0302, the new entropy\nformulae are proposed, from the purely thermodynamic point of view such as the second law\nof thermodynamics be guaranteed.\nSecond, for the case of \u03a9\u0302 < 0, |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1, the modified (Wald's) formula is proposed from\npurely the second law.\nThird, I have found supports for the proposals from a CFT based approach which reproduces\n\n19\n\n\fthe new entropy formulae for |\u03b7\u0302| > 1 and the modified formulae for \u03a9\u0302 < 0, |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1, as well as\nthe usual entropy formula for a small coupling |\u03b7\u0302| \u2264 1, \u03a9\u0302 > 0. This would provide a non-trivial\ncheck of the AdS/CFT correspondence, in the presence of higher curvature/derivative terms in\nthe gravity theory. I have also found that there is no conflict, for the general theory with both\nthe higher curvature and gravitational Chern-Simons terms, from the different Hilbert space\nfor each term.\nSome open problems would be the followings:\n1. A difficult problem of the new entropy formulae is that they require rather unusual\ncharacteristic temperature T\u2212 = \u03ba/(2\u03c0)|r\u2212 or temperature T+ \u2032 = \u2212T+ , being negative-valued,\nor T\u2212 \u2032 = \u2212T\u2212 , and angular velocity \u03a9\u2212 , being the inner-horizon angular velocity in the BTZ\nblack hole. The \"negative\" temperature is quite well defined in the statistical mechanics when\nthere is an upper bound of the energy levels [27]. This situation is is quite similar to our\ncase where the entropy is a function of the mass and there is upper bound of mass. So, the\nnegative-valued temperature might not be so strange in this context. But this is contrast to the\nHawking temperature in the usual Hawking radiation whose radiation spectrum is determined\nby the metric alone [60].\n2. Can we compute the \"classical\" Virasoro algebra \"directly\" in the higher curvature frame,\nwithout recourse to the frame transformation to the theories without the higher curvatures ?\n2\u2032 . Can we explicitly prove that the auxiliary tensor matters which appear after the frame\ntransformation have \"no\" contributions to the Virasoro algebras, such as there are perfect\nagreements between the holographic anomalies and the classical Virasoro algebra approaches ?\nThis would provide a more \"direct\" check of the AdS/CFT correspondence.\n3. Can we find the gauge theoretic formulations of the higher curvature gravities ? This\nwould provide a more \"explicit\" computation of the classical Virasoro algebras [35, 37, 14].\nComplete answers to these problems are still missing. But, as far as the first open problem\nis concerned, I have recently proposed how this might be circumvented by noting some possible\nlimitations of the standard approach initiated by Hawking [60] in our unusual circumstances\n[13, 20]. Here, the important point would be that a dynamical geometry responds differently\nunder the emission of Hawking radiation, even though the formal metric is the same [13]. For\nthe case of negative conformal factor (\u03a9\u0302 < 0) in the higher curvature black hole in Sec. II, for\nexample, the emission of a particle with a (positive) energy \u03c9 would reduce the black holes's\nmass M, which being negative valued, from the conservation of energy, but this corresponds\nto the \"increasing\" of the (positive) mass m in the ordinary BTZ black hole context, due to\nthe negative factor in (2.8). So, this implies that the horizon, in the ordinary BTZ black hole\ncontext, expands as it emits Hawking radiation with a positive energy, in contrast to the case\nof positive mass black hole.\n20\n\n\fHere, the conservations of energy and angular momentum, which are not well enforced in\nthe standard computation, would have a crucial role. In this respect, the Parikh and Wilczek's\napproach [61], which provides a direct derivation of Hawking radiation as a quantum tunneling\nby considering the global conservation law naturally, would be an appropriate framework to\nstudy this problem. This is currently under study.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Jacob Bekenstein, Gungwon Kang, Sergei Odintsov, and Ho-Ung Yee\nfor useful correspondences.
