For this reason, we present mass-loss predictions\nfrom Monte Carlo radiative transfer models for very massive stars up to 300M\u2299 . Using\nour new dynamical approach, we find an upturn or \"kink\" in the mass-loss versus \u0393\ndependence, at the point where our model winds become optically thick. These are\nthe first mass-loss predictions where the transition from optically thin O-star winds to\noptically thick Wolf-Rayet winds has been resolved.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nStellar winds from massive O and Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are ubiquitous and form an\nimportant aspect of both stellar and galaxy evolution. Despite recent reductions in\nO-star mass-loss rates by factors of \u223c3 in comparison to unclumped empirical rates,\npopulation synthesis models by Voss et al. (2009) \u2013 utilizing rotating stellar models\nsuch as those of Meynet & Maeder (2003) that employ theoretical Vink et al. (2000)\nrates that match the factors \u223c3 reduced rates \u2013 show that the role of stellar winds in\nmassive-star feedback has increased over the last decade. The reason for this possibly\ncounter-intuitive finding is that stellar rotation has increased luminosities, whilst the\nobjects also enter the WR-phase sooner. Strong stellar winds may prevent the most\nmassive stars from entering the eruptive Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase, at least\nat Galactic metallicity. It is these very massive stars (VMS) with their strong stellar\nwinds that are thought to dominate the radiative and kinetic energy input in young (<10\nMyr) clusters, as well as the radio-active 26-Al input that gives rise to gamma-ray lines\nfrom Galactic star-forming regions like Orion and Carina (Voss et al. 2010, 2012).\nOur understanding of stellar mass loss from the most massive stars is also crucial\nfor the determination of their final fates, with respect to the formation of intermediate\n1\n\n\f2\n\nJorick S. Vink\n\nmass-black holes (Belkus et al. 2007; Yungelsen et al. 2008), the occurrence of pairinstability supernovae (Langer et al. 2007), and the mass distribution of neutron stars\nand black holes (Heger et al. 2003; Eldridge & Vink 2006)\nA most relevant issue concerns the stellar upper mass limit. Until recently, many\nstudies accepted the existence of an upper limit of 120-150M\u2299 , but a recent study by\nCrowther et al. (2010) claimed much higher luminosities and masses for the central\nWN5h objects of the R136 cluster than previous estimates (de Koter et al. 1997). One\nof the potential problems with the Crowther et al. luminosities is that the stars are\nclustered, and whilst Crowther et al. took great care in the assessment of a potential\nbinary nature of the objects, there is a non-negligible chance that the stars are \"polluted\"\nwith the light from line-of-sight objects.\nIn the context of the VLT Flames Tarantula Survey, we have recently discovered\nand analysed a new WN5h object, VFTS 682, a near-identical twin of R136a3 (Evans\net al. 2011, Bestenlehner et al. 2011). This object is in apparent isolation from the\nR136 cluster, some 30 pc away, which raises interesting questions about its origin (see\nBestenlehner et al. for a discussion on the object having formed in isolation or being a\nslow runaway). It also allowed us to assess the reliability of the Crowther et al. luminosity claims for the WN5h stars in the central cluster. Our finding of log L/L\u2299 = 6.5 \u00b1 0.2\nfor the \"isolated\" object VFTS 682 seems to support the claim for high luminosities of\nWN5h stars in the Tarantula region. As VFTS 682 is in relative isolation from the dense\ncluster, we argue that the chance of a line-of-sight coincidence is much lower than for\nthe WN5h stars in the core of R136, and we thus have independent evidence that the\n\"traditional\" 120 or 150M\u2299 stellar upper-mass limit has been broken. The upshot is that\nmass-loss rates for stars with masses above 150M\u2299 are needed to establish the evolution\nand fate of the most massive stars. Here, we present predictions from 60 up to 300M\u2299 .\nIn the VMS regime, stars are identified as late-type nitrogen-rich WNh stars. These\nobjects are extremely close to the Eddington limit \u0393 = grad /ggrav = \u03baL/(4\u03c0cGM).\n2.\n\nMass loss predictions using the Monte Carlo method\n\nStellar winds from massive stars are driven by radiation pressure as extensively described by e.g. Puls et al. (2008). Our Monte Carlo methodology is basically the same\nas the one used to predict mass-loss rates for standard OB stars (Vink et al. 2000). It is\nbased on the energy extraction method of Abbott & Lucy (1985), and improved by de\nKoter et al. (1997) and Vink et al. (1999). The method underlying the mass-loss recipe\nhowever, was semi-empirical, in the sense that a \u03b2-type velocity law was assumed, that\nreached a certain terminal wind velocity v\u221e , which was consistent with empirical values\n(determined from blue edges of ultraviolet P Cygni profiles). As empirical v\u221e values\nare quite accurate (to within \u223c20%), this was the preferred approach in order to obtain\nreliable theoretical mass-loss rates, that could serve as input in stellar evolution calculations. Nevertheless, now that we wish to predict mass-loss rates for VMS, we advance\nour approach, aiming to derive mass-loss rates without the use of empirical constraints.\nM\u00fcller & Vink (2008) suggested a new line force parametrization that explicitly\ndepends on radius (rather than the velocity gradient as often assumed). Furthermore, a\nnew iteration method was proposed, and utilized with respect to a 40 M\u2299 \"standard\" O\nstar. The results were encouraging in that the predicted v\u221e was only slightly (\u223c10%)\nlarger than observed. More recently, Muijres et al. (2012) computed an extensive grid\nof mass-loss rates and terminal wind velocities, and tested the methodology of M\u00fcller\n\n\fAuthor's Final Checklist\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Mass-loss predictions versus the Eddington parameter \u0393 \u2013 divided by\nM 0.7 . Symbols correspond to models of different mass ranges (Vink et al. 2011).\n\n& Vink (2008) by comparison to hydrodynamical computations. Encouragingly, both\nmethods give similar results for the supergiant regime, validating the M\u00fcller & Vink\n(2008) approach for VMS.\nNugis & Lamers (2002) highlighted the relevance of the iron-peak opacities in\nthe deepest photospheric layers for the initiation of Wolf-Rayet winds, which was confirmed by the Gr\u00e4fener & Hamann (2008) models for hydrogen-rich late WNh stars.\nAccording to these wind models, the presence of opacity peaks may cause \u0393 to exceed\nunity in deep layers, leading to the formation of optically-thick winds. In the Monte\nCarlo approach, we trace the radiative driving of the entire wind, and as most of the\nenergy is transferred in the supersonic regime, we are less susceptible to the details of\nthe photospheric region. Our strategy has the advantage that it allows us to explore the\ntransition from transparent to dense stellar winds, that occurs in models that do include\nthe full \u0393 in subsonic regions for \u0393 close to one. As our Monte Carlo models capture the full physics in the layers around and above the sonic point, we argue that they\ncorrectly predict the qualitative behaviour of the transition from transparent to opaque\nwinds (Vink et al. 2011 for further details).\n3.\n\nResulting VMS mass-loss rates\n\nIn Fig. 1 we present our new dynamically consistent mass-loss predictions for high\n\u0393 values. In order to assess the \u0393 dependence separately from an additional mass or\nluminosity dependence, we divided the new mass-loss rates by M 0.7 . For the lower \u0393\nrange, the slope of \u1e40 \u221d \u03932.2 is in good agreement with previous O star results. We\nhighlight the kink at \u0393 \u223c0.7. Above the kink, the winds are optically thick, and the\n\n\f4\n\nJorick S. Vink\n\nFigure 2. The predicted normalized He ii \u03bb4686 flux versus wavelength for three\nvalues of \u0393 (see Vink et al. 2011).\n\n\u1e40 vs. \u0393 relation has become much steeper, i.e. \u1e40 \u221d \u03934.7 , in agreement with the\nearlier reported \u1e40 \u221d \u03935 for the semi-empirical (i.e. not necessarily locally dynamically\nconsistent) calculations (Vink 2006). This steep slope in the high \u0393 regime agrees\nwell with the empirically determined slope in the Arches cluster stars, as well as that\ndetermined using the PoWR models (see Gr\u00e4fener et al. 2011 for further discussion).\nIn order to find out if radiation-driven mass-loss rates continue to rise with increasing \u0393, we consider the mass-independent wind efficiency parameter \u03b7 = \u1e40v\u221e /(L/c).\nAt values of \u0393 \u223c0.5 we find \u03b7 numbers of \u223c 1, in accordance with standard Vink et al.\n(2000) models. However, when \u0393 approaches unity, \u03b7 rises in a curved manner to values as high as \u03b7 \u22433. Such large \u03b7 values are more commensurate with WR winds than\nthose of common O stars, and these results thus confirm a natural extension from common O-type mass loss to more extreme WN behaviour. Additionally, we note that the\nkink in the predicted mass-loss rate is accompanied by a transition of the velocity-law\nparameter \u03b2, with \u03b2 \u223c1 around the kink, in accordance with models of M\u00fcller & Vink\n(2008) and Muijres et al. (2012), to values larger than unity when \u0393 exceeds 0.7. Large\n\u03b2 values had already been suggested to be more commensurate in WR stars previously,\nbut it is reassuring to find that our modelling naturally predicts a transition in \u03b2 at the\nsame point as where the kink in the mass-loss relations occurs.\n4.\n\nSpectral morphology: the characteristic He 4686 Angstrom line\n\nWe have presented evidence for a transition in the mass-loss-\u0393 exponent, as well as in\nthe wind acceleration parameter \u03b2 from the moderate \u0393 \"optically thin wind\" cases to\n\"optically thick wind\" cases for objects that find themselves above \u0393 >\n\u223c 0.7, forming\n\n\fAuthor's Final Checklist\n\n5\n\npseudo-photospheres. We might expect that the transition \u0393 = 0.7 is the point where\nthe spectral morphology of standard O-type stars changes from the common O and\nOf-types into a WN-type spectrum. The spectral sequence involving the Of/WN stars\nhas a long history (e.g. Walborn et al. 1992) but it had yet to be placed into a proper\ntheoretical context. Figure 2 shows a sequence for the predicted He ii 4686\u00c5 lines for\nthree gradually increasing values of \u0393. Although the first spectrum below the transition \u0393 already shows filled-in emission \u2013 characteristic for Of stars \u2013 the line-flux is\nrather modest compared to that found for the next two profiles with \u0393 values exceeding the critical \u0393 value. The stars show very strong He ii 4686\u00c5 emission lines, more\ncharacteristic for WR stars of the nitrogen sequence (WN).\n5.\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe presented mass-loss predictions from Monte Carlo radiative transfer models for\nVMS in the mass range 40-300M\u2299 and with Eddington factors \u0393 in the range 0.4\u2013\n1.0. Our models suggest that the spectral transition from Of to WN corresponds to\na transition from relatively low \u0393 to high \u0393 values (and larger velocity law parameter\n\u03b2) for WN stars. This assertion is not only based on the numerically larger mass-loss\nvalues, but more specifically on the finding of a \"kink\" at \u0393 = 0.7 where the mass-loss\nslope in function of \u0393 shows an upturn.\nReferences\nAbbott D.C., Lucy L.B. 1985, ApJ 288, 679\nBelkus H., Van Bever J., Vanbeveren D., 2007, ApJ 659, 1576\nBestenlehner J.M., Vink J.S., Gr\u00e4fener G., et al., 2011, A&A 530L, 14\nCrowther P.A., Schnurr O., Hirschi R., et al., 2010, MNRAS 408, 731\nde Koter A., Heap S.R., Hubeny I., 1997, ApJ 477, 792\nEldridge J.J., Vink J.S., 2006, A&A 452, 295\nEvans C.J., Taylor W.D., Henault-Brunet V., et al. 2011, A&A 530, 108\nGr\u00e4fener G., Hamann W.-R. 2008, A&A 482, 945\nGr\u00e4fener G., Vink J.S., de Koter A., Langer N., 2011, A&A (in press), astro-ph/1106.5361\nHeger A., Fryer C.L., Woosley S.E., Langer N., Hartmann D.H., 2003, ApJ 591, 288\nLanger N., et al., 2007, A&A 475, 19\nMeynet G., Maeder A., 2003, A&A 404, 975\nMuijres L., Vink J.S., de Koter A., et al., 2012, A&A submitted\nM\u00fcller P.E., Vink J.S., 2008, A&A 492, 493\nNugis T., Lamers H.J.G.L.M., 2002, A&A 389, 162\nPuls J., Vink J.S., Najarro F., 2008, A&ARv 16, 209\nVink, J.S. 2006, ASPC 353, 113 (astro-ph/0511048)\nVink J.S., de Koter A., Lamers H.J.G.L.M. 1999, A&A 345, 109\nVink J.S., de Koter A., Lamers H.J.G.L.M. 2000, A&A 362, 295\nVink J.S., Muijres L.E., Anthonisse B., et al., 2011, A&A 531, 132\nVoss R., Diehl R., Hartmann D.H., et al., 2009, A&A 504, 531\nVoss R., Diehl R., Vink J.S., Hartmann D.H., 2010, A&A 520, 51\nVoss R., Martin P., Diehl R., Vink J.S., Hartmann D.H., Preibish T., 2012, A&A\nWalborn N.R., Ebbets D.C., Parker J.W., Nichols-Bohlin J., White R.L., 1992, ApJ 393, 13\nYungelson L.R., van den Heuvel E.P.J., Vink J.S., et al., 2008, A&A 477, 223\n\n\f"}
