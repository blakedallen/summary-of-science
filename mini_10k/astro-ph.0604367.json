Their emergence\nsignalled a fundamental transition in cosmic history, from\nan initial state of simplicity to one of increasing complexity\n(e.g. Ciardi & Ferrara 2005). Specifically, the first stars enriched the intergalactic medium (IGM) with the first heavy\nelements (Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Madau, Ferrara & Rees\n2001; Mackey, Bromm & Hernquist 2003; Furlanetto & Loeb\n2003, 2005; Scannapieco, Schneider & Ferrara 2003; Bromm,\nYoshida & Hernquist 2003; Yoshida, Bromm & Hernquist\n2004; Schneider et al. 2006). Secondly, they contributed to\nthe reionization of the Universe, as inferred from the optical\ndepth to Thomson scattering measured by the Wilkinson\nMicrowave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP; Spergel et al. 2006),\ndue to their efficient production of ionizing photons. To elucidate these feedback effects, we have to ask: What were the\nproperties of the first generations of metal-free stars?\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: tgreif@astro.as.utexas.edu\n\nc 0000 RAS\n\nNumerical simulations imply that star formation inside 'minihaloes' relied on molecular hydrogen cooling,\nand resulted in typically very massive so-called Population III (Pop III) stars with characteristic masses >\n\u223c 100 M\u2299\n(Bromm, Coppi & Larson 1999, 2002; Abel, Bryan & Norman 2000, 2002; Nakamura & Umemura 2001). Minihaloes\nare characterized by virial temperatures below 104 K, and\nthe star forming gas did not go through an ionized phase,\nprior to the late stages of the protostellar accretion process.\nIn environments, however, where such ionization did occur,\nthe thermal evolution of the primordial gas is predicted\nto have been markedly different (see Johnson & Bromm\n2006a,b for details). This difference arises because the hydrogen deuteride (HD) molecule provides an additional cooling\nchannel, allowing the metal-free gas to cool to temperatures\nbelow those possible solely via H2 cooling (e.g. Flower et al.\n2000; Galli & Palla 2002; Nakamura & Umemura 2002). Gas\nfragmentation in cases where HD cooling is important could\ntherefore have resulted in metal-free stars that were somewhat less massive than 'classical' Pop III stars. These stars,\nhaving typical masses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 , have been termed Population II.5 (Pop II.5), indicating their transitional status in\nterms of typical mass and formation epoch between Pop III\nand Pop I/II (Mackey et al. 2003; Johnson & Bromm 2006a).\nConnected to this, Tumlinson, Venkatesan & Shull (2004)\nand Tumlinson (2006a,b), together with other groups, have\nargued that the observed chemical abundances in metal-poor\nGalactic halo stars are best explained by assuming that the\n\n\f2\n\nT. H. Greif and V. Bromm\n\nfirst stars were somewhat less massive, different from the\ntheoretical expectation (see Section 4). Our model could\nprovide a natural explanation for such an intermediate mass\nscale, both in terms of the physics of primordial gas cooling\nand in terms of the cosmological environment where such\nstars could have formed.\nThe conditions necessary for HD cooling to become important were possibly met in a number of high-z environments (Johnson & Bromm 2006a). Among them are fossil\nH ii regions, left behind after the death of a Pop III star (e.g.\nNagakura & Omukai 2005; Susa & Umemura 2006; Johnson\n& Bromm 2006a,b; Abel, Wise & Bryan 2006), and shocks\ninduced either by the first supernova (SN) explosions (e.g.\nMachida et al. 2005), or as a result of hierarchical structure formation during the assembly of the first dwarf galaxies (e.g. Uehara & Inutsuka 2000; Nakamura & Umemura\n2002). In this paper, we consider in particular the latter\npossibility, assuming that Pop II.5 stars formed during the\nvirialization of primordial haloes with virial temperatures\n> 104 K, which is sufficient to ionize the collapsing gas.\n\u223c\nIn the following, we construct separate cosmic star formation histories for the two distinct populations of metalfree stars (Section 2). We then compare the ionizing photon\nand heavy element production of our model to observations\n(Section 3), and conclude by summarizing our results and\ndiscussing the relevance of our work in light of recent developments (Section 4).\nThroughout this paper, we adopt a \u039bCDM model of\nhierarchical structure formation, with cosmological parameters consistent with the WMAP 3-yr results (Spergel et\nal. 2006), i.e. density in matter \u03a9m = 1 \u2212 \u03a9\u039b = 0.24,\ndensity in baryons \u03a9b \u0001= 0.042, Hubble parameter h =\nH0 / 100 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 = 0.73, tilt ns = 0.95 and a normalization of the power spectrum to \u03c38 = 0.74. For calculations involving the latter, we use the transfer function of\nEisenstein & Hu (1999).\n\n2\n2.1\n\nCOSMIC STAR FORMATION HISTORY\nPopulation III\n\nAs the very first generation of stars to form out of primordial gas, Pop III has been investigated extensively over the\nlast decade (e.g. Barkana & Loeb 2001; Bromm & Larson\n2004; Ciardi & Ferrara 2005; Glover 2005). Already prior to\nthe first numerical simulations of early structure formation,\nmolecular hydrogen was identified as the primary coolant\nfor pure H/He gas (e.g. Peebles & Dicke 1968; Couchman &\nRees 1986; Tegmark et al. 1997). This view has been confirmed by detailed simulations since 1996 (e.g. Haiman et al.\n1996; Abel et al. 1998, 2000; Bromm et al. 1999, 2002; Fuller\n& Couchman 2000; Nakamura & Umemura 2001; Yoshida\net al. 2003, 2006). Within variants of the CDM model, the\nfirst stars are predicted to have formed in minihaloes of total mass \u2243 106 M\u2299 at redshifts z >\n\u223c 20. Such minihaloes\nhave virial temperatures in excess of a minimum value,\nTmin \u2243 103 K, required for collapsing gas to cool in less than\na Hubble time (e.g. Haiman et al. 1996; Tegmark et al. 1997,\nYoshida et al. 2003). The evolution of gas inside minihaloes,\ndriven by H2 cooling, leads to the formation of protostellar fragments with typical masses >\n\u223c 100 M\u2299 (Bromm et al.\n\n1999, 2002; Abel et al. 2000, 2002; Yoshida et al. 2006). We\nadopt this characteristic mass scale, and assume throughout\nthis paper that Pop III has an extremely top-heavy initial\nmass function (IMF) with cutoffs at 100 and 500 M\u2299 , and a\nstandard Salpeter (1955) slope. Consistent with simulation\nresults (Abel et al. 2000, 2002; Bromm et al. 2002) and recent semianalytic treatments predicting a low Pop III star\nformation efficiency (e.g. Haiman & Bryan 2006; Choudhury\n& Ferrara 2006), we assume f\u2217 \u223c 0.001, which corresponds\nto >\n\u223c 1 stars per halo. However, since uncertainties remain,\nwe will reconsider our choice of this crucial quantity in later\nsections.\n\n2.1.1\n\nPopulation III Star Formation\n\nA straigthforward semianalytic approach to determine the\nstar formation rate (SFR) for Pop III is given by the PressSchechter (PS) formalism (Press & Schechter 1974), providing an expression for the abundance of dark matter haloes.\nAn improved fit to simulation results is obtained by assuming ellipsoidal instead of spherical collapse, introduced by\nSheth, Mo & Tormen (2001). In quantitative studies (e.g.\nHeitmann et al. 2006; Reed et al. 2006), the Sheth-Tormen\n(ST) approach has proven to be significantly more accurate,\nwith maximum deviations of \u2243 50 per cent, leading us to\nadopt this formalism for all further calculations. By comparison, the PS mass function underpredicts the abundance\nof haloes at very high redshifts by almost an order of magnitude, although our qualitative results remain unaffected.\nUsing the ST approximation, we can estimate the number of dark matter haloes, N (M, z), per unit mass and comoving volume at a given redshift:\ndN (M, z)\n= nST (M, z) .\ndM dV\n\n(1)\n\nSince only a small fraction of haloes is massive enough to\nfulfil the cooling condition imposed by Tvir > Tmin = 103 K,\nwe must adjust the limits of integration appropriately when\ncalculating the collapsed fraction of mass, Fcol (z), available\nfor Pop III star formation:\n1\nFcol (z) =\n\u03c1m\n\nZ\n\nMmax\n\ndM M nST (M, z) ,\n\n(2)\n\nMmin\n\nwhere \u03c1m is the total mass density of the background universe. The limits in the integral, Mmin = Mcrit (Tmin ) and\nMmax = Mcrit (Tmax ), are related to the virial temperature\nby:\nMcrit = 108 M\u2299\n\n\u0010 \u03bc \u0011\u22123/2 \u0010 T \u00113/2 \u0010 1 + z \u0011\u22123/2\nvir\n0.6\n\n104 K\n\n10\n\n, (3)\n\nwhere \u03bc is the mean molecular weight, i.e. 1.2 for neutral\nand 0.6 for ionized, primordial gas. Since the Universe is\nmostly neutral at high redshifts, we choose \u03bc = 1.2 for all\nfurther calculations. The lower mass limit in the integral corresponds to the minimum virial temperature below which\nhaloes cannot cool efficiently. We set the upper limit to\n8\nTmax = 104 K, as haloes with masses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 go through\na more complicated cooling process, leading to the formation of stars with characteristic masses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 , termed\nPop II.5. This novel generation of stars will be discussed in\nSection 2.2.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTwo populations of metal-free stars in the early Universe\nApplying the above criteria, we obtain a preliminary\nform for the Pop III SFR:\n\u03a8\u2217 (z) = \u03c1m\n\ndFcol (z)\n\u03a9b\nf\u2217\n\u03a9m\ndz\n\ndz\ndt\n\n.\n\nFeedback Mechanisms\n\nAt some point during primordial star formation, negative\nfeedback effects must have become important, eventually\nterminating the Pop III mode, as stars in the present-day\nUniverse are characterized by much higher metallicities and\ntypically have low masses. Perhaps the most relevant negative feedback mechanism is heating due to photoionization (photoheating), since massive Pop III stars produce\nvast amounts of ionizing photons (e.g. Tumlinson & Shull\n2000; Bromm, Kudritzki & Loeb 2001b; Schaerer 2002),\nwith escape fractions around unity (Whalen, Abel & Norman 2004; Kitayama & Yoshida 2005; Alvarez, Bromm &\nShapiro 2006a). Related to this, other radiative feedback\nmechanisms have also been considered (for a recent review,\nsee Ciardi & Ferrara 2005).\nOf particular importance is the impact of radiation\nin the Lyman-Werner (LW) bands on neighbouring minihaloes, which might readily dissociate H2 and suppress efficient cooling (e.g. Haiman, Rees & Loeb 1997; Omukai &\nNishi 1999; Ciardi, Ferrara & Abel 2000; Haiman, Abel &\nRees 2000; Machacek, Bryan & Abel 2001; Ricotti, Gnedin\n& Shull 2001, 2002a,b; Kitayama et al. 2001; Glover &\nBrand 2001; Yoshida et al. 2003; Omukai & Yoshii 2003;\nMesinger, Bryan & Haiman 2006; MacIntyre, Santoro &\nThomas 2006). Despite the extensive effort, no consensus\nhas yet been reached on the overall significance of this effect. Alternatively, positive feedback due to an early X-ray\nbackground produced by relic black holes has been suggested\n(e.g. Haiman et al. 2000; Machacek, Bryan & Abel 2003;\nGlover & Brand 2003). Pop III stars in the range 100 \u2013 140\nand 260 \u2013 500 M\u2299 are expected to collapse directly to black\nholes after their main sequence lifetimes of <\n\u223c 3 Myr (Heger\net al. 2003), emitting X-rays during the subsequent accretion of gas. Other possible sources include X-ray binaries\nand SN remnants (e.g. Natarajan & Almaini 2000; Helfand\n& Moran 2001). The buildup of an early X-ray background\ncould enhance the production of free electrons in neighbouring minihaloes, thereby increasing the H2 fraction and consequently the cooling rate. This would result in an increase\nof Pop III star formation and could possibly compensate for\nnegative feedback caused by photoheating or LW radiation.\nBased on the revised value of the optical depth to\nThomson scattering (e.g. Spergel et al. 2006), we find that\nPop III must have been terminated fairly rapidly (see Section 3). This leads us to concentrate on negative feedback,\nand in the following we will discuss the impact of the LW\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nbackground, and subsequently of photoheating, on primordial star formation.\n\n(4)\n\nThe solid line in Panel (b) of Fig. 1 shows the result, implying that Pop III star formation peaks around z \u2243 10, and\ndeclines sharply towards z \u2243 5, as an increasing number\nof minihaloes merge into larger haloes with masses above\nMmax . We emphasize that this is not the final SFR, as we\nhave neglected all forms of feedback. In the next few sections, we will therefore investigate the impact of relevant\nfeedback mechanisms on Pop III.\n\n2.1.2\n\n3\n\n2.1.3\n\nLyman-Werner Feedback\n\nThe high masses and surface temperatures of Pop III stars\ngive rise to yields of the order of 105 ionizing photons per\nstellar baryon (e.g Bromm et al. 2001b; Schaerer 2002). Naturally, the flux in the LW bands is also high, dissociating H2\nin neighbouring haloes and reducing the fraction of gas that\ncan cool efficiently. To describe this feedback mechanism,\nwe must find a connection between the background LW flux\nand the cooling rate of a halo, and also between the mass in\nstars and the associated photon yields.\nFor simplicity, we assume that all emitted LW photons escape into the IGM, and are thus available for H2 dissociation in a nearby minihalo, but account for the redshifting of photons out of the LW bands. This approach\nclearly overestimates the LW background, yet will turn out\nto be instructive when discussing the results. The buildup of\na homogeneous LW background proceeds over a very short\nperiod of time, since the comoving mean free path of a LW\nphoton at z = 30 is \u2243 10 Mpc (Mackey et al. 2003). Often, the presence of such a pervading background has been\nassumed in investigating the cooling process of a minihalo\nunder LW irradiation. Specifically, Machacek et al. (2001)\nhave derived an analytic fit to their simulation results, giving an estimate of the gas fraction that cools and reaches\nhigh densities as a function of halo mass and LW flux:\nfLW (M, J21 ) = 0.06 ln\n\n\u0012\n\nM/M\u2299\n0.47\n1.25 \u00d7 105 + 8.7 \u00d7 105 F21\n\n\u0013\n\n, (5)\n\nwhere F21 = 4\u03c0J21 is the flux in the LW bands, such that:\nJLW = J21 \u00d7 10\u221221 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 . This formula\nexplicitly shows that H2 cooling rates rise towards higher\nhalo masses, enabling them to withstand larger amounts of\nLW flux. Averaging this fraction over the halo mass range\nhosting Pop III, and 'normalizing' it to the value obtained\nfor an absent LW background, yields the mass fraction of\ngas available for star formation as a function of z and J21 :\n\nRM\n\nmax\ndM M nST (M, z)fLW (M, J21 )\nMmin\n \u0304\nfLW (J21 , z) = R Mmax\n, (6)\ndM M nST (M, z)fLW (M, J21 = 0)\nM\nmin\n\nwhere the normalisation accounts for the fact that Machacek\net al. (2001) imply a definition for the star formation efficiency different from our choice of a constant f\u2217 , independent of halo mass. Thus, the SFR at any given redshift is\nreduced relative to the no-feedback SFR of equation (4) by\nprecisely this factor:\n\u03a8\u2032\u2217 (J21 , z) = f \u0304LW (J21 , z)\u03a8\u2217 (z) ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere J21 is implicitly a function of redshift as it is linked\nto the mass already incorporated into stars. To complete\nthe feedback cycle, we must therefore connect the LW flux\nwith the comoving density in stars, \u03c1\u2217 (z). For simplicity, we\nassume that the ratio of mean LW frequency to the relevant\nbandwidth is of the order of unity:\nJLW (z) \u2243\n\nhc\n\u03b7LW \u03c1\u2217 (z) (1 + z)3 ,\n4\u03c0mH\n\n(8)\n\n\f4\n\nT. H. Greif and V. Bromm\n\nwhere \u03b7LW is the number of photons emitted in the LW\nbands per stellar baryon, and:\n\u03c1\u2217 (z) =\n\nZ\n\nzr\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (z \u2032 )\n\nz\n\ndt\ndz \u2032 ,\ndz \u2032\n\n(9)\n\nsuch that \u2206z = zr \u2212 z corresponds to the maximum distance a LW photon can travel before it is redshifted out\nof the LW bands. Since all stellar populations contribute\nto the LW background, possibly with distinct values for\n\u03b7LW , the star formation histories of Pop II.5 and Pop I/II\nare directly linked to Pop III. Schaerer (2002) has provided time-integrated spectral properties of metal-free stars\nover a wide range of masses, and our calculations of \u03b7LW\nare based on this work. For Pop III, we integrate over the\nSalpeter-weighted mass range 100 \u2013 500 M\u2299 , which results\nin \u03b7LW \u2243 104 . As will be discussed in more detail later in this\npaper, Pop II.5 is assumed to have masses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 , leading us to adopt mass cut-offs at 10 and 100 M\u2299 , and again\na standard Salpeter slope. Using the spectra of Schaerer\n(2002), we find \u03b7LW \u2243 2 \u00d7 104 . For Pop I/II, we adopt\n\u03b7LW = 4\u00d7103 , which is comparable to the ionizing flux. The\nexplicit SFRs used for Pop II.5 and Pop I/II correspond to\n1/3\nthe feedback parameter Kw = 2/3, which will be discussed\nlater. We note, however, that varying this parameter hardly\naffects our results.\nApplying the above treatment allows us to describe\nPop III star formation in an evolving LW background. Our\ncalculation is shown in Fig. 1 (dotted line), compared to\nthe no-feedback case (solid line). Somewhat surprisingly, the\noverall amplitude of the effect is not too high, although we\nhave conservatively assumed that no LW photons are lost.\nOn the other hand, we have not included the effect of biasing since the build-up of a homogenuous LW background\nis very rapid. The shape of the modified SFR is also quite\ninteresting, and can be explained by a decomposition into\ntwo competing processes: As the LW background increases,\nthe Pop III SFR tends to decline, yet as haloes become more\nmassive, they can sustain higher LW fluxes, enabling ongoing Pop III star formation towards lower redshifts. To summarize, LW feedback might not be as efficient as previously\nassumed (e.g. Haiman et al. 1997; Mackey et al. 2003), yet\nfor definitive conclusions one must apply detailed numerical\nsimulations that self-consistently solve the hydrodynamics\nand radiative transfer.\n2.1.4\n\nPhotoheating\n\nThe emergence of the first H ii regions around star-forming\nhaloes has an important effect on high-redshift star formation. The temperature of ionized bubbles is raised to\n\u223c 104 K, quenching star formation in affected regions, as\nprimordial gas can no longer condense into the shallow gravitational wells of minihaloes. Since Pop III stars produce copious amounts of ionizing photons, with escape fractions of\nthe order of unity (e.g. Alvarez et al. 2006a), and haloes are\nstrongly biased at these high redshifts, photoheating could\nin fact be a dominant feedback mechanism for Pop III (e.g.\nKramer & Haiman 2006). To quantify this feedback, we begin with given ionization histories, and assume that Pop III\nstar formation is suppressed by a factor equal to the volume\nfilling fraction of ionized regions, Qion (z), weighted by the\nmean correlation between haloes. With this treatment, we\n\nFigure 1. (a) Buildup of the LW background in units of\n10\u221221 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 Hz\u22121 sr\u22121 . We here consider the LW radiation produced by all stellar populations. (b) The SFR for Pop III,\nneglecting all feedback effects (solid line), and after inclusion of\nLW feedback (dotted line).\n\nmight overestimate the strength of the feedback, as alreadycollapsed haloes are subject to photoevaporation rather than\ninfall suppression due to photoheating, the former being a\nmuch slower process (e.g. Shapiro, Iliev & Raga 2004; Iliev,\nShapiro & Raga 2005). However, since the collapse of neighboring minihaloes is synchronized only to within \u223c 107 yr,\ncompared to propagation times of the first H ii regions of\n\u223c 106 yr (e.g. Alvarez et al. 2006a), we expect that most\nhaloes have not yet reached high enough densities to be subject to photoevaporation.\nTo explicitly determine the effect of biasing, we use the\nwell-known linear correlation function \u03behh (M, R, z) between\ntwo haloes of mass M at a comoving distance R:\n\u03behh (M, R, z) = b2 (M, z)\u03bemm (R) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere b(M, z) is the linear bias of a halo of mass M and\n\u03bemm (R) is the mass correlation function (e.g. Mo & White\n2002). Since haloes are distributed according to the ST function, we can determine the average bias at any given redshift:\nb\u0304(z) =\n\nR Mmax\n\ndM M b(M, z)nST (M, z)\n\nMmin\nMmax\n\nR\n\nMmin\n\ndM M nST (M, z)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhich replaces b(M, z) in equation (10). The second step\nconsists of linking the volume filling fraction of ionized regions to the typical size of an ionized bubble, which we do\nby assuming that the volume of a typical H ii region is equal\nto Qion (z) divided by the current number density of haloes,\nn(z):\nQion (z)\n4\n\u03c0R3 (z) =\n.\n3\nn(z)\n\n(12)\n\nWith these preparations, we can ascertain the probability pion (z) that a freshly collapsed halo lies within an already\nexisting H ii region:\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTwo populations of metal-free stars in the early Universe\npion (z) = Qion (z) [1 + \u03behh (z)] ,\n\n5\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the halo correlation function \u03behh (z) adopts the interpretation of an excess probability. This enables us to write\nthe modified SFR with respect to the no-feedback SFR as:\n\u03a8\u2032\u2217 (z) = [1 \u2212 pion (z)] \u03a8\u2217 (z) .\n\n(14)\n\nTo calculate the SFRs we must supply reionization histories, and choose Gaussian functions of the form Qion (z) =\n2\ne\u2212(z\u22126) /w , where w = 57, 25 and 5 corresponds to early, intermediate and late reionization, respectively. For all three\ncases, reionization ends at z = 6, thus being in agreement with observations suggesting that the Universe was\ncompletely ionized by z >\n\u223c 6, e.g. the absence of the Gunn\n& Peterson (1965) trough in the spectra of high-redshift\nquasars, and considerations of the thermal history of the\nIGM (e.g. Theuns et al. 2002; Hui & Haiman 2003). Additionally, the three reionization histories reproduce optical\ndepths of \u03c4 = 0.12, 0.09 and 0.06, thus spanning the current error bars of the WMAP measurement. For the three\ndifferent values of w as mentioned above, Panel (a) in Fig. 2\nshows early (dotted line), intermediate (dashed line) and\nlate (dot-dashed line) reionization, whereas Panel (b) traces\nthe modified SFRs derived from these reionization histories.\nAs is evident from the plots, the different epochs of reionization lead to vastly different SFRs, with efficiencies varying\nby more than one order of magnitude. This is primarily an\neffect of halo biasing, amplifying the impact of small volume filling fractions Qion (z). We tentatively conclude that\nPop III ends very rapidly once a small number of minihaloes\nhave formed stars.\nAt this point, it is important to note that we have not\nyet derived self-consistent reionization and star formation\nhistories. However, it is instructive to outline the range of\npossibilities and defer conclusions about the most likely and\nself-consistent scenario to later sections.\n\n2.2\n\nPopulation II.5\n\nThe term Pop III has traditionally been used to denote stars\nforming in extremely low metallicity environments, independent of the associated halo mass. In the following, we will\ndeviate from this terminology, and instead distinguish between two populations of metal-free stars according to the\nenvironments in which they form. We thereby propose an intermediate stellar generation between Pop III and Pop I/II\n(see Mackey et al. 2003; Johnson & Bromm 2006a).\nAs discussed in Section 2.1, haloes in the range Tvir \u2243\n103 \u2013 104 K cool almost exclusively by molecular hydrogen\ntransitions, and produce stars with an extremely top-heavy\nIMF. Yet gas assembled in more massive haloes goes through\nan ionized phase and experiences a different cooling process\n(Johnson & Bromm 2006a,b). In this process, HD cooling\nallows the gas temperature to reach that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) within a Hubble time. By reaching the CMB limit, these haloes produce stars with typical\nmasses >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 , about an order of magnitude less than is\nthe case for Pop III (Johnson & Bromm 2006a). Associating\nthis intermediate generation of stars with metal-free haloes\nabove Tvir = 104 K allows us to derive a SFR for Pop II.5.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nFigure 2. (a) Early (dotted line), intermediate (dashed line) and\nlate (dot-dashed line) reionization, here applied to calculate the\nsuppression of Pop III star formation by photoheating. (b) Comparison of the modified SFRs to the no-feedback case (solid line).\n\n2.2.1\n\nPopulation II.5 Star Formation\n\nTo obtain a preliminary SFR for Pop II.5, we once again\napply the ST formalism, yet adjust the limits of integration\nwhen determining the collapsed mass fraction\n\u0001 by setting the\nlower limit to Mmin = Mcrit Tmin = 104 K and the upper\nlimit to infinity. This satisfies the conditions for their formation sites, as these haloes go through an ionized phase in the\ncourse of their virialization (e.g. Johnson & Bromm 2006a).\nThe SFR is computed according to equation (4), except that\nwe use a different star formation efficiency, f\u2217 \u223c 0.01. This\nchoice reflects the intermediate nature of Pop II.5 between\nPop III and Pop I/II, and will be further justified in later\nsections. The solid line in Panel (b) of Fig. 3 shows the resulting SFR, implying that Pop II.5 produces stars about an\norder of magnitude more efficiently than Pop III (see Fig. 2),\nbut also peaks at later times.\n\n2.2.2\n\nFeedback Mechanisms\n\nDue to the deep potential wells of typical Pop II.5 haloes\n8\n(>\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 ), and the fact that cooling by atomic hydrogen sets in, photoheating is no longer a dominant feedback\nmechanism. Specifically, Dijkstra et al. (2004) have shown\nthat suppression of gas infall is not as efficient in the highredshift Universe as it is for z <\n\u223c 6. We performed calculations including infall suppression in ionized regions of the\nIGM and verified this conclusion. Efficient self-shielding of\nionized gas assembled in more massive haloes also renders\nLW feedback unimportant (see Johnson & Bromm 2006b).\nConsequently, Pop II.5 can only be terminated by chemical feedback, as multiple SNe in a host galaxy combine to\nform so-called 'superwinds', expanding into the IGM and\nenriching neighbouring haloes with metals (e.g. Madau et\nal. 2001; Mori, Ferrara & Madau 2002; Furlanetto & Loeb\n\n\f6\n\nT. H. Greif and V. Bromm\n\n2003, 2005; Wada & Venkatesan 2003). In the next section,\nwe will therefore introduce a semianalytic model describing\nchemical enrichment, which subsequently leads to the termination of Pop II.5.\n2.2.3\n\nChemical Feedback\n\nOnce the metallicity of the IGM exceeds a critical level, the\nformation of primordial, metal-free stars is suppressed and\nstar formation switches to a more conventional mode (e.g.\nOmukai 2000; Bromm et al. 2001a; Schneider et al. 2002).\nThe precise value of this 'critical metallicity' is still heavily debated, as some authors argue that dust production in\nthe early Universe might be responsible for lowering Zcrit\nto almost 10\u22126 Z\u2299 (e.g. Schneider et al. 2006, and references therein). However, due to remaining uncertainties we\nchoose the more robust value Zcrit = 10\u22123.5 Z\u2299 , which is\nbased on the physics of fine structure cooling, and does not\ndepend on whether dust is present or not, and if so, what\nits composition might be (e.g. Bromm et al. 2001a; Bromm\n& Loeb 2003; Santoro & Shull 2006). Pop III stars in the\nrange 140 \u2013 260 M\u2299 explode as Pair-Instability Supernovae\n(PISNe), with substantial metal yields y \u2243 0.5 (Heger et\nal. 2003), yet due to their rare nature they are likely inefficient polluters (also see Section 3.3). We therefore suggest\nthat Pop II.5 is largely responsible for enriching the IGM\nabove the critical threshold and quenching metal-free star\nformation.\nIn modelling the propagation and distribution of metals,\nwe closely follow the semianalytic treatment of SNe winds\nperformed by Furlanetto & Loeb (2005). Utilizing the wellknown Sedov (1959) solution of an expanding bubble in a\nuniform background, they find an expression for the ratio of\nenriched mass to (total) halo mass:\n\u03b7(M )\n\n=\n\n3/5\n27Kw f\u22173/5 E51\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\nM\n1010 M\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9sn\n100 M\u2299\n\n\u0013\u22122/5 \u0010\n\n\u0013\u22123/5\n\n1+z\n10\n\n\u0011\u22123/5\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere Kw is a free parameter describing radiative losses, E51\nis the typical energy emitted by a SN in units of 1051 erg and\n\u03c9sn is the mass in stars per SN (\u2243 20 M\u2299 for our assumed\nPop II.5 IMF). By integrating \u03b7(M ) over the ST function\nto determine the fraction of space with metals, and weighting it with the mean bias at a given reshift, Furlanetto &\nLoeb derive a probability function ppris (z) for freshly collapsed gas to be pristine. We identify this quantity with the\nfraction of gas that has just collapsed and is available for\nPop II.5 star formation. In doing so, we implicitly assume\nthat the mean metallicity of the fraction of space reached by\nan expanding superwind lies well above Zcrit . We will justify\nthis assumption below.\nThe properties of these SNe follow directly from our\nassumed IMF. Stars in the range \u2243 10 \u2013 25 M\u2299 explode\nas conventional core-collapse SNe with energies E51 \u2243 1,\nand metal yields y \u2243 0.05, while stars with masses above\n\u2243 40 M\u2299 collapse directly to black holes (Heger et al. 2003).\nThe fate of stars with masses 25 \u2013 40 M\u2299 seems to be not\nso unambiguous, as those with low core angular momenta\nend their lives as faint SNe, while those with higher core\nangular momenta may explode as hypernovae (HNe), with\n\nenergy outputs E51 >\n\u223c 10 (Heger et al. 2003). As a reasonable\ncompromise, we therefore assume that all stars in the range\n25 \u2013 40 M\u2299 explode as HNe with typical energies E51 =\n10, although variations herein do not significantly affect our\nresults. Averaging the energy output and metal yield over\nthe IMF results in E \u030451 \u2243 2 and \u0233 \u2243 0.04.\nWith this information, we can determine the metal content of a region affected by a typical superwind. Explicitly,\nthe metallicity of an enriched region is given by the ratio of\nmass in metals Mz to the mass of the expanding bubble:\nZ=\n\n\u03a9m Mz\n.\n\u03a9b \u03b7(M )M\n\n(16)\n\nThe mass in metals can be calculated from the total mass\nof the star-forming region by means of the star formation\nefficiency and the metal yield, resulting in:\nZ\n\n=\n\ny\n\u22123/5\nf 2/5 E51\n27Kw \u2217\n\u00d7\n\n\u0012\n\nM\n1010 M\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c9sn\n100 M\u2299\n\n\u00132/5 \u0010\n\n1+z\n10\n\n\u00133/5\n\n\u00113/5\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\nFor a typical Pop II.5 halo of 108 M\u2299 , forming at z = 15,\n1/3\nand with Kw set to the fiducial value 2/3, we find Z \u2243\n\u22123\n3 \u00d7 10 Z\u2299 . This lies well above the critical metallicity and\nproves that our initial assumption was justified.\nTo obtain a SFR that accounts for enrichment by superwinds, we simply multiply the original SFR with ppris (z),\nthereby selecting the pristine fraction of freshly collapsed\ngas:\n\u03a8\u2032\u2217 (z) = ppris (z)\u03a8\u2217 (z) .\n\n(18)\n\nUsing this semianalytic model, we compute star formation\nhistories for three different radiation loss parameters, i.e.\n1/3\nKw = 1, 2/3 and 1/2, corresponding to strong, intermediate and weak chemical feedback, respectively. Panel (a) in\n1/3\n1/3\nFig. 3 shows ppris (z) for Kw = 1 (dotted line), Kw = 2/3\n1/3\n(dashed line) and Kw = 1/2 (dot-dashed line), whereas\nPanel (b) shows the implied SFRs. As expected, higher radiative losses result in less chemical enrichment and more efficient star formation. Also, the termination process is much\nslower than is the case for Pop III, due to the nature of\nthe feedback: Wind hosts are heavily biased at these high\nredshifts, implying that enriching superwinds overlap and\ndo not enrich large volume filling fractions, whereas the effect of biasing only marginally inhibits the propagation of\nionization fronts.\n2.3\n\nPopulation I/II\n\nIn order to compare the SFRs we have derived for Pop III\nand Pop II.5 to recent stellar generations, and also determine the reionization history of the Universe, we will briefly\ndiscuss our model for Pop I/II. Closely following the treatment of Pop II.5, and maintaining consistency in terms of\nour ST approach, we assume that haloes above Tvir = 104 K\nform Pop I/II stars once they have been polluted by enriching superwinds:\n\u03a8\u2032\u2217 (z) = [1 \u2212 ppris (z)] \u03a8\u2217 (z) ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03a8\u2217 (z) is the no-feedback SFR introduced in Section 2.2.1.

Note that this expression was derived for\nthe WMAP first year parameters, and the true SFR would\nbe somewhat lower. In the redshift regime of interest, i.e.\nz<\n\u223c 15, both plots are in good agreement, since at higher\nredshifts Pop II.5 becomes the dominant mode.\nIn the next section, we will evaluate the SFRs we have\nderived for Pop III, Pop II.5 and Pop I/II by comparing\nthe ionizing photon and metal production to observational\nconstraints.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nOBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES\n\nTo test the validity of our models, we must compare our\nSFRs to observational signatures. This turns out to be a\nformidable task, as the sites of early star formation are the\nmost distant sources of stellar radiation in the Universe,\nand all empirical constraints to date have been indirect. Yet\nthe situation is rapidly improving by utilizing existing telescopes such as Spitzer, and pushing them to their limits\n(e.g. Barkana & Loeb 2001; Bromm & Larson 2004; Ciardi\n& Ferrara 2005; Beers & Christlieb 2005).\nOne of the most important clues on early star formation\nis the WMAP measurement of the optical depth to Thomson\nscattering, recently revised to be \u03c4 \u2243 0.09 \u00b1 0.03 (Spergel et\nal. 2006). By providing an integral constraint on the total\nionizing photon production of the Universe, this measurement is well suited to validate our models. Related to this,\nwe briefly consider the contribution of metal-free stars to the\ncosmic near infrared background (CNIRB), as an excess in\nthe range 1 \u2013 2 \u03bcm has been discovered after subtraction of\nall known foreground sources (Cambr\u00e9sy et al. 2001; Santos,\nBromm & Kamionkowski 2002).\nAnother observational probe with great promise concerns the distribution of metals in the Universe, as considerable improvements have been made in measuring the\nmetallicity of the IGM by quasar absorption lines (e.g. Pettini 2001). By computing the mass fraction of metals ejected\ninto the IGM, we compare our results to metal abundances\nof the Ly\u03b1 forest (e.g. Songaila 2001), thereby elucidating\nthe enrichment properties of Pop III and Pop II.5. Finally,\nwe consider how metal-poor Galactic halo stars can be accomodated within our theoretical framework (for a recent\nreview see Beers & Christlieb 2005).\n\n3.1\n\nFigure 4. Pop I/II star formation for intermediate chemical feedback (dashed line), compared to an analytic fit by Springel &\nHernquist (solid line).\n\n7\n\nIonizing Photon Production\n\nThe most significant change related to the release of the\nWMAP 3-yr results concerns the optical depth to Thomson\nscattering, as the refined measurement revealed a reduction\nby nearly 50 per cent. At first sight, this might imply that\nearly star formation was greatly suppressed, yet due to revisions in other cosmological parameters as well (i.e. the fluctuation power at small scales), high-z structure formation is\nrather shifted to lower redshifts by \u2206z \u2243 5, implying that\nprimordial star formation is still relevant (e.g. Alvarez et\nal. 2006b). To investigate this connection more thoroughly,\nwe must determine reionization histories and optical depths\nproduced by our SFRs.\nA straightforward manner of quantifying the evolution\nof H ii regions is to assume that each photon escaping a host\ngalaxy ionizes one intergalactic hydrogen or helium atom.\nSupplementing this by a term encompassing recombination\nof electrons results in a simple formula for the evolution of\nthe volume filling fraction of ionized regions (e.g. Wyithe &\nLoeb 2003, and references therein):\ndQion (z)\ndz\n\n=\n\n1 dnion (z)\n\u2212 \u03b1B nb C(z)\nnb\ndz\ndt\n,\n\u00d7Q2ion (z) (1 + z)3\ndz\n\n(21)\n\nwhere nb is the comoving density in baryons, nion (z) the\ncomoving density in ionizing photons, \u03b1B the case B re-\n\n\f8\n\nT. H. Greif and V. Bromm\n\ncombination coefficient and C(z) the clumping factor. This\nmethod is well established in modelling the evolution of H ii\nregions, and we refer to Wyithe & Loeb (2003) for details.\nThroughout this paper, we choose \u03b1B = 2.6\u00d710\u221213 cm3 s\u22121 ,\nassuming that ionized regions are photoheated to \u223c 104 K\n(e.g. Osterbrock & Ferland 1989). To concentrate on the\nkey effects, we make the following simplifying assumptions:\n(i) We neglect ionizing photons emitted by quasars. (ii) We\ndo not distinguish between helium and hydrogen, implying\nthat helium can only be ionized once. (iii) We use a simple analytic fit of the form C(z) = 1 + 9 [(1 + z) /7]\u22122 , with\nC(z) = const. = 10 for z < 6, to describe the evolution of\nthe clumping factor. This is a compromise between contemporary approaches, and we refer to Haiman & Bryan (2006)\nfor further discussion.\nThe crucial quantity in equation (21) is nion (z), as it\nlinks our SFRs to the ionizing photon production. We establish this connection by assuming that the number of ionizing\nphotons emitted per redshift interval is proportional to the\nSFR. Explicitly, the conversion from newly formed mass in\nstars to the comoving density of ionizing photons is given\nby:\n1 dnion (z)\ndt\n1 \u03a9m\n=\nfesc \u03b7ion \u03a8\u2217 (z)\nnb\ndz\n\u03c1m \u03a9b\ndz\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere fesc is the escape fraction of ionizing photons from\nthe host halo and \u03b7ion the number of ionizing photons emitted per stellar baryon. Evidently, fesc and \u03b7ion have different\nvalues for each population, and much effort has been undertaken to constrain these parameters. Specifically, Alvarez et\nal. (2006a) have found the escape fraction of ionizing photons in minihaloes to be between 0.5 and 1, leading us to\nadopt fesc = 0.7 for Pop III. The escape fraction for typical\nPop I/II galaxies is a strong function of redshift (e.g. Inoue,\nIwata & Deharveng 2006), yet for early galaxies a reasonable estimate is 0.1, whereas for Pop II.5 we can only guess\nthat the best-fitting value must lie between 0.7 and 0.1. We\nhereby use fesc \u2243 0.3, but keep in mind that it is generally\na free parameter. In deriving \u03b7ion for Pop III and Pop II.5,\nwe proceed similarly to Section 2, and use the spectra for\nmetal-free stars provided by Schaerer (2002). This yields\n\u03b7ion \u2243 9 \u00d7 104 for Pop III, and \u03b7ion \u2243 3 \u00d7 104 for Pop II.5.\nA common estimate for the ionizing photon production of\nPop I/II is \u03b7ion \u2243 4 \u00d7 103 .\nWith these quantities at hand, we compute the ionization histories Qion (z) implied by our SFRs. Panel (a) in\nFig. 5 shows the ionization histories for the three distinct\nSFRs for Pop III determined in Section 2, i.e. early (dotted\nline), intermediate (dashed line) and late (dot-dashed line)\nreionization, combined with intermediate chemical feeback\nfor Pop II.5 (although variations in Kw hardly affect our\nresults). By comparing Fig. 5 with Fig. 2, we conclude that\nintermediate reionization is by far the most likely and selfconsistent model, as especially late reionization permits a\ngenuinely high SFR (see Fig. 2), which induces a large contribution to the ionizing photon production, and ultimately\ncontradicts the proposed reionization history. This further\nconfirms our assumption that Pop III must be terminated\nfairly rapidly.\nIn a final step, we determime the optical depth to\nThomson scattering implied by these ionization histories:\n\nFigure 5. Ionization histories (a), and implied optical depths\n(b) for the cases of preliminary early (dotted line), intermediate\n(dashed line) and late (dot-dashed line) reionization, as used to\ncalculate the SFRs for Pop III (also see Fig. 2). For comparison,\nPanel (b) includes the range of allowed values for the optical depth\nas measured by WMAP (long-dashed lines).\n\n\u03c4 = c\u03c3T nb\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nz\n\ndz \u2032 Qion (z \u2032 ) 1 + z \u2032\n\n\u00013 dt\n\ndz \u2032\n\n,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere z is the redshift of emission and \u03c3T the cross-section\nto Thomson scattering (e.g. Wyithe & Loeb 2003). According to this equation, the optical depth of a given ionization\nhistory is a well determined quantity, and Panel (b) in Fig. 5\nshows the optical depths corresponding to the three reionization histories of Panel (a). Not surprisingly, late reionization\n(as in Fig. 2) produces a value near the upper limit, whereas\nfor early and intermediate reionization the resulting optical\ndepth is very close to \u03c4 = 0.09.\nAt this point, we have also tested the validity of our star\nformation efficiencies for Pop III and Pop II.5. For values\nmuch higher than our fiducial choices (see Table 1), we find\noptical depths that are unrealistically large. On the other\nhand, much smaller values completely neglect primordial\nstar formation for ionization purposes. Taken together, this\nleads us to maintain the values we assumed in Section 2.\n3.2\n\nNear Infrared Background\n\nThe high ionizing photon yields of typical Pop III and\nPop II.5 stars might imply a significant contribution to the\nCNIRB. This possibility was investigated in detail by Santos\net al. (2002), as an excess of the order \u223c 1 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121 in\nthe wavelength regime 1 \u2013 2 \u03bcm was detected by the Diffuse\nInfrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on the Cosmic\nBackground Explorer (COBE; e.g. Cambr\u00e9sy et al. 2001).\nThe possible contribution to this wavelength range is made\nup of Ly\u03b1 photons, redshifted by the amount \u2206z \u2243 7 on the\nlower end, and \u2206z \u2243 15 on the higher end, implying that\nthis period of time was relevant for producing the observed\nexcess. Since Pop III is already extinct at these redshifts\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTwo populations of metal-free stars in the early Universe\n\n9\n\n(we only consider intermediate reionization), Pop II.5 is the\nonly remaining candidate. To determine its importance for\nthe CNIRB, we link the ionizing photon production to the\nmass in stars, and for simplicity assume that all ionizing\nphotons are reprocessed through recombinations into Ly\u03b1\nemission:\nJNIR \u2243\n\nhc\n\u03b7ion\n4\u03c0mH\n\nZ\n\n15\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (z)\n\n7\n\ndt\ndz .\ndz\n\n(24)\n\nHere, we have once again assumed that \u03bd\u0304NIR /\u2206\u03bdNIR is of the\norder of unity. Fairly independent of Kw , this results in an\nupper limit of JNIR \u223c 10\u22123 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121 , which is much too\nlow to account for the observed discrepancy. However, this\nresult does not exclude the possibility of tracing primordial\nstars with fluctuations of the cosmic infrared background,\nas suggested by Kashlinsky et al. (2004).\n3.3\n\nFigure 6. Chemical Enrichment of the IGM by Pop III for intermediate reionization (dashed line), compared to the Ly\u03b1 forest\nand the critical metallicity Zcrit (long-dashed lines).\n\nMetal Production\n\nIn recent years, detailed studies of quasar absorption lines\nhave provided a means of probing metal abundances of Ly\u03b1\nsystems with column densities as low as 1014 cm\u22122 , made\npossible by improvements in data analysis techniques (e.g.\nPettini 2001, and references therein). One of the most important developments concerns the discovery of a metallicity\nfloor in the Ly\u03b1 forest of the order 10\u22123 Z\u2299 in the redshift\nrange z \u2243 2 \u2013 6, which cannot be explained by galactic outflows of normal Pop I/II galaxies (e.g. Songaila 2001; Aguirre\net al. 2005). This implies that early star formation might\nhave been responsible for establishing such a homogeneous\nlevel of enrichment. Following up on this conclusion, we discuss enrichment models for both Pop III and Pop II.5, and\nelucidate their contributions to the observed metal abundances of the IGM.\n\n10\u22123.5 Z\u2299 (long-dashed lines). For the case of highly efficient mixing, chemical enrichment by Pop III does not raise\nthe globally averaged metallicity above Zcrit , implying that\nPop II.5 star formation remains possible even in regions affected by PISNe winds. As is evident from Fig. 6, we predict a minimum bedrock metallicity in the IGM of the order\nZIGM \u223c 10\u22125 Z\u2299 , much lower than current measurements\nof the Ly\u03b1 forest imply. This is not necessarily a contradiction, as the lowest column density regions of the IGM are\nnot yet accessible for probing. Detecting such a low bedrock\nmetallicity would provide a telltale signature of Pop III star\nformation in early minihaloes.\n\n3.3.2\n3.3.1\n\nIntergalactic Enrichment by Pop III\n\nAs Heger et al. (2003) have discussed, Pop III stars in the\nrange 140 \u2013 260 M\u2299 end their lives as PISNe, extremely violent SNe explosions with energies E51 <\n\u223c 100 and metal yields\n0.5.\nDue\nto\nthe\nshallow\npotential\nwells of minihaloes,\ny<\n\u223c\nthese massive explosions completely evacuate their gaseous\ncontent, and distribute metals into the IGM with high efficiency and homogeneity (e.g. Bromm et al. 2003; Yoshida\net al. 2004). On the other hand, Pop III stars with initial\nmasses in the range 100 \u2013 140 and 260 \u2013 500 M\u2299 collapse directly to black holes, making them negligible for enrichment\npurposes (Heger et al. 2003). To find the correctly weighted\nmetal yield, we average y over the IMF, resulting in \u0233 \u2243 0.2.\nThis quantity is essential in modelling the enrichment process by Pop III, as it connects the mass in stars to the mass\nin metals. Applying the argument of homogeneous enrichment, we estimate a lower limit of the IGM metallicity by\ndetermining the ratio of density in metals to the background\ndensity for a given SFR:\n\u0233\nZIGM (z) =\n\u03c1m\n\nZ\n\nz\n\n\u221e\n\n\u03a8\u2217 (z \u2032 )\n\ndt\ndz \u2032 .\ndz \u2032\n\n(25)\n\nFig. 6 shows the resulting metallicity of the IGM for intermediate reionization (dashed line), compared to the fiducial value Z \u223c 10\u22123 Z\u2299 for measurements of the Ly\u03b1 forest (e.g. Songaila 2001), and the critical metallicity Zcrit =\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nLocal Enrichment by Pop II.5\n\nThe assumption of homogeneous metal distribution throughout the IGM breaks down for Pop II.5, as typical explosion\nenergies of conventional core-collapse SNe are significantly\nlower than those of PISNe, and the Universe at large has\ngrown much more inhomogeneous since the epoch of Pop III.\nWe therefore assume that metals are distributed only inside\nenriching superwinds, and use equation (15) to determine\nthe average density of such an enriched region:\n\u03c1\u0304(z) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndM M \u03b7(M, z)nST (M, z) .\n\n(26)\n\nMmin\n\nInserting \u03c1\u0304 instead of \u03c1m into equation (25), and adopting the relevant values of \u0233, E51 and f\u2217 for Pop II.5, we\ndetermine the average metallicity of regions affected by superwinds. For our fiducial parameter Kw = 2/3 this yields\nZ \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 Z\u2299 , which is in very good agreement with\nour calculation of Section 2, and lies close to measurements\nof low column density Ly\u03b1 clouds (e.g. Songaila 2001). The\nmetallicity exceeds Zcrit by almost one order of magnitude,\nfurther confirming our initial assumption that superwinds\nquench metal-free star formation in affected regions. An intuitively unexpected result is that stronger chemical feedback results in less efficient metal production, which can be\nexplained by the fact that a decrease in radiative losses enables the enriching winds to pollute larger regions of the\nIGM, thereby terminating Pop II.5 more efficiently.\n\n\f10\n\nT. H. Greif and V. Bromm\n\n3.3.3\n\nMetal-Poor Halo Stars\n\nThe discovery of metal-poor stars in the halo of the Milky\nWay with extremely low iron content, yet excess light element abundances, has triggered discussion on the properties\nof the first stars (e.g. Beers & Christlieb 2005). Various authors have argued that a less top-heavy IMF is more successfull in reproducing the observed abundance patterns, as\nfaint SNe and HNe of intermediate mass stars produce metal\nyields consistent with those found in metal-poor halo stars,\nprovided these are of second-generation and formed from\nthe relics of a metal-free population (e.g. Heger & Woosley\n2002; Umeda & Nomoto 2002, 2003, 2005; Tumlinson et al.\n2004; Daigne et al. 2004; Iwamoto et al. 2005). Based on the\ndetailed physics of gas cooling, we have found primordial\nstar formation to be dominated by stars >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 , and can\ntherefore naturally account for the existence of metal-poor\nhalo stars.\n\n4\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have constructed star formation histories for two distinct\npopulations of metal-free stars, characterized by their respective IMFs and formation environments. Specifically, we\nhave attributed Pop III to form in minihaloes with characteristic stellar masses >\n\u223c 100 M\u2299 , whereas second-generation\n8\nhaloes of >\n10\nM\ngive\nrise to an intermediate Popula\u2299\n\u223c\ntion II.5, enabling the formation of >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 stars by activating HD as an important low-temperature coolant. Acknowledging that both populations are subject to radiative\nand chemical feedback, we have shown that Pop III is terminated in the course of reionization, whereas Pop II.5 ends\nwith the distribution of metals into the IGM by enriching superwinds, raising the metallicity in affected regions\nabove Zcrit = 10\u22123.5 Z\u2299 . We have confirmed the validity of\nour models by determining reionization histories and optical\ndepths, and have excluded a dominant primordial contribution to the excess of the CNIRB background in the wavelength regime 1 \u2013 2 \u03bcm. Finally, we have discussed chemical\nenrichment of the IGM by Pop III and Pop II.5, finding that\nPop III produces a minimum bedrock metallicity in the IGM\nof the order ZIGM \u223c 10\u22125 Z\u2299 , whereas Pop II.5 enriches the\nIGM to levels of the low column density Ly\u03b1 forest. Summarizing these results, Fig. 7 compares the best-fitting SFRs\nfor all three stellar populations, whereas Table 1 shows their\ncharacteristic quantities.\nThe introduction of an intermediate generation of\nmetal-free stars by means of formation environment provides a possible physical explanation to the empirically derived argument that early star formation might have been\ndominated by a less top-heavy IMF (e.g. Umeda & Nomoto\n2002, 2003; Tumlinson et al. 2004; Tumlinson 2006a,b). One\nhint comes from the realization that a single, top-heavy primordial population might overproduce metals while underproducing ionizing photons (e.g. Ricotti & Ostriker 2004;\nDaigne et al. 2004, 2005; Matteucci & Calura 2005). Some\nauthors have also pointed out that metal yields of low column density Ly\u03b1 clouds at z \u2243 2 \u2013 6 show enrichment signatures by more intermediate mass stars (e.g. Daigne et al.\n2004, 2005; Matteucci & Calura 2005). Another argument\nfocuses on the abundance patterns of metal-poor Galactic\n\nFigure 7.

By additionally considering the chemical evolution\nof the Galaxy, it has been found that a more moderate\nIMF dominated by >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 stars best fits the currently\navailable observational constraints (e.g. Tumlinson 2006a,b).\nMost recently, the revision of the optical depth to Thomson\nscattering has further weakened the case for a purely topheavy primordial population, even in the light of a significantly reduced amplitude of the matter fluctuation power\n(e.g. Choudhury & Ferrara 2006; Haiman & Bryan 2006).\nTaken together, these arguments provide a strong case for\na more moderate IMF, yet thus far no physical framework\nhas been found to accomodate such lower mass stars. In this\npaper, we have shown that the physics of HD cooling lead to\na natural transition in terms of typical stellar masses, and\nforce a distinction between two populations of metal-free\nstars.\nWhat was the relative importance of Pop III and\nPop II.5? From our models, we estimate that only \u2243\n10 per cent of all mass involved in metal-free star formation went into Pop III, and that Pop II.5 was the dominant,\nand typical, mode of primordial star formation. This might\nsuggest that Pop III had a negligible impact on observable\nquantities, yet due to their extreme nature they might have\nnevertheless left distinct signatures. Especially their influence on the IGM could have been notable, as we expect\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTwo populations of metal-free stars in the early Universe\nthat only PISNe are able to enrich the lowest column density regions in a homogeneous manner. Another clue might\nbe provided by a characteristic reionization signature, as\nPop III stars have unique spectra (e.g. Tumlinson & Shull\n2000; Tumlinson, Giroux & Shull 2001; Bromm et al. 2001b;\nOh, Haiman & Rees 2001; Tumlinson, Shull & Venkatesan\n2003; Venkatesan, Tumlinson & Shull 2003). In light of these\nfindings, it is essential to push observational frontiers to ever\nhigher redshifts, yet also extend the reach of numerical simulations to more complex cosmological environments. In future work, we plan to apply such simulations to address the\nissues of intergalactic metal enrichment and star formation\nin atomic cooling haloes.\n\n5\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank Marcelo A.
