By the monotonicity formula, the function A(r) = A(r)\nr2\nis monotonically increasing. We say that M has area growth constant A(M) \u2208 (0, \u221e], if\nA(M) = limr\u2192\u221e A(r). Note that under a rigid motion or homothety M \u2032 of M, the number\nA(M) = A(M \u2032 ), and so, A(M) \u2265 \u03c0, which is the area growth constant of a plane. We say\nthat M has quadratic area growth, if A(M) < \u221e.\nBasic results in geometric measure theory imply that for any M with quadratic area\ngrowth and for any sequence of positive numbers ti \u2192 0, the sequence homothetic shrinkings\nM(i) = ti M of M contains a subsequence that converges on compact subsets of R3 to a limit\n\u2217\n\npartially supported by NSF grant DMS-0405836.\npartially supported by NSF grants DMS-9971563 and DMS-0139887. Any opinions, findings, and\nconclusions or recommendations expressed in this publication are those of the authors and do not necessarily\nreflect the views of the NSF.\n\u2020\n\n1\n\n\fminimal cone C in R3 over a geodesic integral varifold in the unit sphere S 2 , which consists\nof a balanced finite configuration of geodesic arcs with positive integer multiplicities. C is\ncalled a limit tangent cone at infinity to M.\nIn 1834, Scherk [14] discovered a singly-periodic embedded minimal surface S \u03c02 in R3\nwith quadratic area growth constant 2\u03c0. Away from the x3 -axis, Scherk's surface is asymptotic to the union of the (x1 , x3 )-plane and the (x2 , x3 )-plane. Geometrically Scherk's singlyperiodic surface may be viewed as the desingularization of these two orthogonal planes,\nwhich form its unique limit tangent cone at infinity. In 1988, Karcher [2] defined a oneparameter deformation S\u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ], of Scherk's original surface S \u03c02 , which are also called\nScherk surfaces and which may be viewed as the desingularization of two vertical planes\nwith an angle \u03b8 between them. The limit tangent cone at infinity to S\u03b8 consists of the\nunion of these planes. We remark that under appropriate homothetic scalings, the surfaces\nS\u03b8 converge to a catenoid as \u03b8 \u2192 0. Note that a catenoid has a plane of multiplicity two\nas its limit tangent cone at infinity.\nIn [6], Meeks presented the following three conjectures related to minimal surfaces with\nquadratic area growth.\nConjecture 1. (Unique Limit Tangent Cone Conjecture, see Conjecture 11 in [6].) A\nproperly immersed minimal surface in R3 of quadratic area growth has a unique limit\ntangent cone at infinity.\nConjecture 2. (Quadratic Area Growth Conjecture, see Conjecture 13 in [6].) A properly\nimmersed minimal surface M in R3 has quadratic area growth if and only if there exists a\nstandard double cone in R3 that intersects M in a compact set. By standard double cone,\nwe mean the union of all lines in R3 passing through the origin and through some \u03b5-disk\non S 2 , \u03b5 < \u03c02 .\nConjecture 3. (Scherk Uniqueness Conjecture, see Conjecture 10 in [6].) A connected\nproperly immersed minimal surface M in R3 with quadratic area growth constant A(M) <\n3\u03c0 must be a plane, a catenoid or a Scherk singly-periodic minimal surfaces S\u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ].\nThe main goal of this paper is to prove Conjecture 3 under the additional hypothesis of\ninfinite symmetry.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 1. A connected properly immersed minimal surface in R3 with infinite symmetry\ngroup and area growth constant less than 3\u03c0 is a plane, a catenoid or a Scherk singly-periodic\nminimal surface.\nWe view Theorem 1 as a first step in resolving Conjecture 3. We hope that some of the\nideas used in the proof of Theorem 1 will eventually lead to a proof of this more general\nconjecture and that such a proof will in turn lead to a positive solution of the following\nfundamental singularities question.\nConjecture 4. (Isolated Singularities Conjecture, see Conjecture 4 in [6].) Suppose M is\na minimal surface in a closed geodesic ball B in a Riemannian three-manifold such that\n\u2202M \u2282 \u2202B and M is properly embedded in B punctured at the center of the ball. Then,\nM extends across the puncture to a smooth compact embedded minimal surface in B.\nSuppose now that M is a properly immersed minimal surface in R3 with infinite symmetry group. Then, M is either a surface of revolution, and so, is a catenoid, or M is invariant\nunder a screw motion symmetry with possibly trivial rotational part and the symmetry acts\nin an orientation preserving manner on M. In [11], Meeks and Rosenberg studied properly\nembedded minimal surfaces M in R3 , which are invariant under a group Z of isometries\ngenerated by a screw motion symmetry with vertical axis and whose quotient surface M in\nthe flat three-manifold R3 /Z has finite topology. They proved that the ends of such a M\nare asymptotic to horizontal planes, vertical flat half annuli (quotients of half planes in R3 )\nor helicoid ends in R3 /Z. Thus, if M has quadratic area growth and M has finite topology (finitely generated fundamental group), then M must have ends asymptotic to vertical\nhalf annuli. Such annular ends of M are called Scherk ends, because the singly-periodic\nquotients S \u03b8 of the classical Scherk examples, S\u03b8 \u2282 R3 , \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ], have this type of end. It\nfollows that M is also invariant under a pure translation, and so, after a rigid motion and\nhomothety, we will assume that Z = {(0, 0, n) | n \u2208 Z} acts by translation on R3 in this\ncase.\nThe next theorem is the key result that we need to prove Theorem 1.\nTheorem 2. The Scherk minimal surfaces S \u03b8 are the unique connected minimal surfaces\nin R3 /Z with four Scherk ends.\n3\n\n\fTo our knowledge, this theorem is the first uniqueness result for singly-periodic Scherk\nsurfaces of genus greater than 1. The case of genus 0 was shown by Meeks and Rosenberg\n[9], and the case of genus 1 was carried out in the doctorial thesis of Hai-Ping Luo [5].\nWe emphasize a corollary of Theorem 2, by noting that if M \u2282 R3 /Z has ends asymptotic\nto vertical half annuli, then its lift to R3 , in the complement of a vertical cylinder, is\nasymptotic to four half planes. Thus, we may regard such a surface as a periodic minimal\ndesingularization of the intersection of two planes, and rephrase Theorem 2 as:\nCorollary 1. The Scherk minimal surfaces S \u03b8 are the unique connected periodic minimal\ndesingularizations of the intersections of two planes.\nOur proof of Theorem 1 is broken up into a series of propositions, which appear in\nsections of the manuscript. Let M \u2282 R3 /Z be a connected properly immersed minimal\nsurface with four Scherk ends. The lifted surface M \u2282 R3 then has quadratic area growth\nconstant 2\u03c0. Applying the monotonicity formula for area to M at a possible point of\nself-intersection, we see that M is an embedded minimal surface. In section 2, we prove\nthat the corresponding M has two vertical planes of Alexandrov symmetry, just as the\nclassical Scherk examples have. These planes decompose M into four nonempty closed\nsimply connected regions; we study two one-forms underlying the Weierstrass representation\nof M. These forms naturally define flat structures on each of these four regions in M, and\nthese flat structures develop to one of the two complements of a zigzag in E2 . In section\n3, we prove a local rigidity theorem for the surfaces M with fixed angle \u03b8 between their\nScherk ends. The implicit function theorem then asserts that in terms of the angle map\nbetween the Scherk ends \u03b8 : M\u03ba \u2192 (0, \u03c02 ], defined on the moduli space M\u03ba of examples\nM of genus \u03ba in R3 /Z (defined up to congruence), we have that every component of M\u03ba\nis a nontrivial curve C and \u03b8|C : C \u2192 \u03b8(C) \u2282 (0, \u03c02 ] is a diffeomorphism. In section 4,\nwe prove that \u03b8 : M\u03ba \u2192 (0, \u03c02 ] is proper, and so, \u03b8|C : C \u2192 (0, \u03c02 ] is a diffeomorphism. In\nsection 5, we prove that for \u03b1 close to 0, \u03b8\u22121 (\u03b1) is one of the Scherk examples S \u03b1 . Thus,\nM\u03ba contains only one component, which is the component of Scherk examples. This result\nproves Theorem 2.\nIn section 6, we prove that if M is a properly embedded minimal surface in R3 with\nA(M) < 3\u03c0, then A(M) = \u03c0 and M is a plane or A(M) = 2\u03c0. Under the assumption that\nM has infinite symmetry group, we then prove that M is either a catenoid or M is invariant\n4\n\n\funder a group Z of translations with M = M/Z having finite topology. Then, our results\nfrom section 5 complete the proof of Theorem 1.\nOur basic strategy of proving Theorem 2 is to show that the angle map \u03b8 on the moduli\nspace is open and proper and that examples with small angle in M\u03ba are Scherk; this strategy\nis motivated by the proofs of two previous uniqueness theorems in the literature. LazardHolly and Meeks [4] used this approach in their characterization of the family of Scherk\ndoubly-periodic minimal surfaces Se\u03b8 , \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c02 ], which are also parametrized by the angle\nbetween the ends of their quotient surfaces, as being the only properly embedded minimal\nsurfaces in R3 with genus 0 quotients. A similar approach was also used by Meeks, Perez\nand Ros [8] to characterize of the one-parameter family of Riemann minimal examples,\nthe helicoid and the plane, as being the only properly embedded periodic genus 0 minimal\nsurfaces in R3 . In another direction, Perez and Traizet [13] have recently classified the\nproperly embedded singly-periodic minimal surfaces with quotient surfaces having genus 0\nand finite topology; their classification theorem has similar structural attributes and they\nprove that these surfaces are precisely the Scherk towers defined earlier by Karcher [2].\nTheir classification result then leads to the classification [12] of properly embedded doublyperiodic minimal surfaces in R3 whose quotients have genus 1 and parallel annular ends in\nT \u00d7 R, where T is a flat torus. We remark that this last classification result implies that\nthese genus 1 minimal surfaces are the same examples which were defined by Karcher in\n[3].\nFinally, we remark that the idea used in our proof of Theorem 1 of demonstrating the\nlocal rigidity of a minimal surface in a moduli space of flat structures is a cornerstone of the\nwork of Weber and Wolf ([20, 18, 19]) in their Teichm\u00fcller-theoretic approach to existence\nproblems in minimal surface theory.\n\n2\n\nExistence of Alexandrov planes of reflectional symmetry.\n\nThe following proposition is well-known to experts in the field and the proof (unpublished)\nwe give is due to Harold Rosenberg.\n\n5\n\n\fProposition 3. Let M \u2282 R3 be a properly embedded minimal surface invariant under\ntranslation by the vectors Z = {(0, 0, n) | n \u2208 Z} and such that the quotient surface M =\nM/Z has four Scherk ends and the genus of M is \u03ba. Let Ax1 and Ax2 be the vertical annuli\nparallel to the x1 and x2 axes, respectively, which are quotients of the vertical (x1 , x3 )- and\nthe (x2 , x3 )-planes, respectively by the Z-action.\nThen:\n1. After rigid motion, we may assume M is invariant under reflection in the vertical\nannuli Ax1 , Ax2 , which each intersect M orthogonally in \u03ba + 1 strictly convex simple\nclosed curves contained in the respective annuli.\n2. The regions of M on either side of Ax1 or Ax2 are graphs over their projections\nto the respective annuli. In particular, the (x1 , x3 )-plane and the (x2 , x3 )-plane are\nAlexandrov planes of reflexive symmetry for M, after a rigid motion of M.\nProof. Consider the flux vectors\nvi =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b3i\n\n(\u2207x1 , \u2207x2 ), i = 1, 2, 3, 4\n\ndefined for oriented loops \u03b31 , \u03b32, \u03b33 , \u03b34 around the four cyclically ordered Scherk ends of M.\nSince each of these vectors is a unit vector and the sum of these vectors is zero by the\ndivergence theorem, we see that after a rotation of M around the x3 -axis, we must have\nv1 = (cos \u03b1, sin \u03b1), v2 = (cos \u03b1, \u2212 sin \u03b1), v3 = \u2212v1 and v4 = \u2212v2 , where \u03b1 \u2208 (0, \u03c04 ]. Note\nthat the Scherk ends of M are asymptotic to ends A1 , A2 , A3 , A4 , of flat vertical annuli,\nwhere vi is parallel to Ai .\nNow consider the family E(1, t) of vertical annuli, which are parallel to Ax1 and pass\nthrough the point (0, t, 0), for t \u2208 R. Let R(1, t) : R2 \u00d7 R/Z \u2192 R2 \u00d7 R/Z denote reflection\nacross E(1, t), let M + (1, t) denote the portion of M on the side of E(1, t) which contains\nlarge positive x1 valued points of M and let M \u2212 (1, t) = R(1, t)(M + (1, t)). Note that\nfor t > 0 sufficiently large, the surface M + (1, t) consists of two almost flat annular end\nrepresentatives for M and \u2202M + (1, t) = \u2202M \u2212 (1, t) = M \u2229 M \u2212 (1, t).\nDefine t1 to be the infinum of the values t such that M + (1, t) is a nonnegative graph\nwith bounded gradient over its projection to E(1, t) and \u2202M \u2212 (1, t) = M \u2229 M \u2212 (1, t). By\n6\n\n\fthe interior maximum principle and the Hopf maximum principle applied along \u2202M \u2212 (1, t1 ),\nwe observe that M + (1, t1 ) is a graph over its projection to E(1, t1 ), R(1, t1 )(M ) = M\nand M is orthogonal to E(1, t1 ). This observation is just the standard one that arises in\nthe application of the Alexandrov reflection argument, when one take into account the\nmaximum principle at infinity [10] which guarantees that an end of M \u2212 (1, t1 ) cannot be\nasymptotic to an end of M unless M \u2212 (1, t1 ) \u2282 M .\nNote that \u2202M + (1, t1 ) consists of a finite number of simple closed curves in E(1, t1 ), since\nit has compact boundary. Furthermore, M + (1, t1 ) is a planar domain with two ends, since\nit is a graph over a proper noncompact planar domain in the annulus E(1, t1 ) with two\nends. Since the Euler characteristic \u03c7(M ) = 2(1 \u2212 \u03ba) \u2212 4 = \u22122 \u2212 2\u03ba, then \u2202M + (1, t1 ) =\nM \u2229 E(1, t1 ) consists of \u03ba + 1 simple closed curves. Since these curves are planar lines of\ncurvature on M and M + (1, t1 ) is a graph over its projection to E(1, t1 ), then the simple\nclosed curves in \u2202M+ (1, t) are strictly convex curves bounding disks in E(1, t1 ).\nSimilarly, we have for some t2 a related annulus E(2, t2 ) parallel to Ax2 , which is an\nAlexandrov annulus of symmetry for M . After a fixed translation of M , we may assume that\nthe circle E(1, t1 ) \u2229 E(2, t2 ) is (0, 0) \u00d7 R/Z \u2282 R2 \u00d7 R/Z. The proposition now follows.\n\n3\n\nThe angle map \u03b8 : M\u03ba \u2192 (0, \u221e] is a local diffeomorphism.\n\nOur goal in this section is to prove the following result.\nProposition 4. For any component C in M\u03ba, the image \u03b8(C) is an open subset of (0, \u03c02 ]\nand \u03b8|C : C \u2192 \u03b8(C) is a diffeomorphism.\nThe proof of Proposition 4 will depend on the following lemma.\nLemma 5. If M \u2208 M\u03ba with \u03b8(M ) = \u03b80 , then M is locally rigid, i.e., there are no deformations of M though a family of minimal surfaces in M\u03ba with the same angle \u03b80 .\nBefore we begin the proofs, we need to recall the Weierstrass representation and set\nsome notation. Recall that for a Riemann surface R with a holomorphic function g and\n\n7\n\n\fa holomorphic form dh (not necessarily exact, despite the notation), we may define a\nconformal branched minimal immersion via a map F : R \u2192 E3 by\nZ\nz\u2192\n7 Re\n\nz\n\n\u03c10\n\n\u0010 \u0010\n1\n2\n\ng\u2212\n\n1\ng\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1\ndh, g + g dh, dh .\ni\n2\n\n(1)\n\nFor this surface, the function g will be the Gauss map (postcomposed with stereographic projection) and dh will be the complexified differential of the third coordinate in\nE3 . Conversely, given a conformal minimal immersion F : R \u2192 E3 with Gauss map g and\ncomplexified differential dh of the third coordinate, the surface may be represented by the\nexpression (1). The induced metric on the minimal surface is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\ndsF (R) =\n|g| +\n|dh|;\n(2)\n2\n|g|\nthus a regular minimal surface will have zeroes of dh of order n balanced by poles or zeroes\nof g of the same order.\nThe global problem for producing minimal surfaces is that of well-definedness: analytic\ncontinuation around a cycle must leave the map unchanged. Thus we require\nZ \u0010\nZ \u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1\n1\nRe 2 g \u2212 g dh = Re 2i g + g1 dh\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nZ\n(3)\n= Re dh = 0\n\u03b3\n\nfor every cycle \u03b3 \u2282 R.\nWith this background in hand, we may begin the proof of Lemma 5.\nProof. Let M be the lift of M to R3 . Let g and dh denote the Weierstrass data of M in\nthe standard notation. These combine to define the forms gdh and g1 dh, which we restrict\nto one of the fundamental domains of the surface with respect to the Z2 \u2295 Z2 group of\nAlexandrov reflections guaranteed to exist by Proposition 3.\n\n3.1\n\nThe shape of the developments of |gdh| and | 1g dh|.\n\nThe fundamental domain described above is planar, and as the group elements act as isometries of the singular flat metrics |gdh| and | 1g dh|, the forms gdh and g1 dh develop injectively\n8\n\n\fto planar Euclidean domains, say \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh bounded by a 'zigzag' boundary, as we\ndescribe in just a moment. Before we do that, however, we note that we already see that\nas the fundamental domain is periodic with respect to a translation (in space), which is an\nisometry of |gdh| and | 1g dh| as well, then the developed image of the domain is invariant by\na cyclic group of translational isometries (of the plane).\nMuch of our attention in this section will be focussed on the boundaries of the developed\ndomains \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh , as those boundaries contain much of the geometry of the surface\nM. Indeed, from the geometry of M, we recognize the basic shape of the zigzag boundary\nof the developed image in E2 . To draw this boundary, begin by drawing an arc downwards\nfor some distance at a slope of \u22121. Then make a left turn and draw a segment upwards at\na slope of +1. Then draw downwards along a segment of slope \u22121, etc. Continue drawing\nin this way n = 2\u03ba + 2 segments (n is even and \u03ba is the genus of M) and then repeat the\npattern indefinitely, both backwards and forwards. This construction is meant to determine\nthe gdh structure (the portion of the plane above the zigzag) for the surface M.\nThe 1g dh structure is then determined by the requirement that its periods should be\nR\nR\nconjugate to those of the gdh structure, i.e. gdh = \u03b3 g1 dh for all cycles \u03b3 \u2282 M. So we do\nthis: on another plane, we draw another zigzag, so that the portion of the plane above that\nzigzag will correspond to the 1g dh structure. The conjugate period requirement is that we\ndraw it as follows: we draw the first arc at a slope of +1 and of exactly the same length as\nthe first segment on the first (gdh) zigzag. Then we draw the second arc at a slope of \u22121 of\nexactly the same length as the second segment on the first zigzag. We draw the third arc at\nslope +1 and of the same length as the third segment of the first zigzag. We continue this\nconstruction for all n segments and then repeat in both directions to guarantee symmetry\nby an infinite group of translations (i.e. isometries of the range E2 of development).\nWe assert that the developments \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh of a fundamental domain for the\naction of the Z2 \u2295 Z2 group of Alexandrov reflections on M have the forms described above.\nIn effect, we have to prove two statements to justify this: first we need to show that the\nboundary of those domains \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh are piecewise straight, and then we need to\nshow that those straight edges meet at angles that alternate between \u03c02 and 32 \u03c0. For the first\nclaim, note that those Alexandrov reflections are isometries of the flat singular metrics |gdh|\nand | g1 dh|, and that the boundary of the fundamental domain is fixed by the isometry. But\n9\n\n\fas a smooth fixed set of an isometry is totally geodesic, and the metrics |gdh| and | 1g dh|\nare flat and smooth away from the the poles and zeroes of g, we see that the smooth\ncomponents of the boundary of the developed images (\u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh ) of the fundamental\ndomain of M is bounded by straight lines. Next observe that at the endpoints of those\ngeodesic segments (those endpoints corresponding to the 2\u03ba + 2 points where M meets\nthe intersection Ax2 \u2229 Ax1 described in Proposition 3), the forms gdh and g1 dh alternate\nbetween being regular and having second order zeroes. (Also, one of those two forms has\na double zero at such a point if and only if the other one of the forms is regular there.) Of\ncourse, the developed image of a holomorphic one-form with a zero of order k has a cone\npoint with cone angle 2\u03c0(k + 1); as these endpoints of the straight lines are fixed points\nof all four of the reflections, we see that one-quarter of the cone-angles will be visible in\none of the fundamental domains. Thus the boundaries will be composed of straight lines,\nmeeting at angles that alternate between \u03c02 and 23 \u03c0, with angles at corresponding points of\n\u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh disagreeing, as claimed.\nBecause the gdh and g1 dh structures are defined on the same Riemann surface, there is\na conformal map between those planar domains (above the corresponding zigzag).\nIn all of this, we have ignored the flat structure for the form dh. This is because, following\nthe same procedure for the development of dh as we did for the developments of \u03a9gdh and\n\u03a9g\u22121 dh , we see that the form dh develops on a fundamental domain to a domain with\npiecewise straight edges meeting at angles of \u03c0. Thus the developed image is a (geometric)\nhalfplane with a periodic collection of distinguished points on the boundary. As any such\ndomain satisfies the (vertical) period condition that the distinguished points lie horizontally\nparallel to each other, we see that any such domain will satisfy the relevant period condition,\nand there is no restriction on the geometry of this domain. This geometric fact corresponds\nto the observation that the developed domain doubles to a geometric sphere, so that the\nform dh is exact. From both points of view, we cannot expect to glean much information\nfrom the period condition for M on dh.\n\n3.2\n\nThe angle between the ends.\n\nHaving described the geometric structure of the developments \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh of the defining Weierstrass forms gdh and 1g dh of M, our next goal is to describe the moduli space\n10\n\n\fM(\u03b80 ) of candidates for surfaces with asymptotic angle fixed at \u03b8 = \u03b80 . To do this, we\nneed to recognize the angle between those asymptotic planes in the zigzags, as our moduli\nspace will be defined in terms of zigzags.\nProposition 6. There is a function m(\u03b8) which is strictly monotone in \u03b8 so that if\nthe Scherk ends of M make an angle of \u03b8 with one another, then the zigzag boundaries\nof the domains \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh are invariant by a group of translations generated by\nhz 7\u2192 z + lM (e) exp(im(\u03b8))i, where lM (e) is the length of the translation vector of M and\n\u221a\ni = \u22121.\nWe begin by considering the quotient of the surface by a single vertical plane of sym\u2192\n\u2212\nmetry. A single fundamental domain of the quotient has flux F across this boundary equal\nto the flux across its ends, the latter given by\n\u2212\n\u2192\nF = (2 cos(\u03b8/2))h~n.\n\n(4)\n\nHere \u03b8 is the angle between the planes, h is the (normalized) height of the fundamental\ndomain, and ~n is the (appropriate) normal to the reflective planes. Of course, the pair of\nends of the domain is homologous to the \u03ba + 1 closed curves {\u03b31 , . . . , \u03b3\u03ba+1} of intersection\nbetween the plane and the surface. As these curves are orthogonal to the plane, the flux\nacross those circles is given by\nX\n\u2212\n\u2192\nlM (\u03b3i )~n\nF =\n\u03ba+1\n\ni=1\n\u03ba+1 Z\nX\n\n!\n1\n1\n(|g| + )|dh| ~n\n=\n2\n|g|\n\u03b3\ni\ni=1\n\u0015!\nZ\n\u03ba+1 \u0014Z\n1\n1 X\n|gdh| +\n| dh| ~n,\n=\n2 i=1 \u03b3i\n\u03b3i g\n\nas the line element on the surface is given by dsM = 12 (|g| +\nthe length of the flux vector as\n\n1\n)|dh|.\n|g|\n\n\u2192\n\u2212\n1X\n[l|gdh| (\u03b3i ) + l|gdh| (\u03b3i )].\nF = |F | =\n2 i=0\n\u03ba+1\n\n11\n\nThus, we can rewrite\n\n\fWe now consider the quotient by action of reflection in the other vertical plane. As\nreflection about this plane is an isometry for the metrics |gdh| and | 1g dh|, we see that we\nmay rewrite the previous equation as\nF =\n\n\u03ba+1\nX\n\n[l\u03a9gdh (\u0393i ) + l\u03a9g\u22121 dh (\u0393i )].\n\ni=0\n\nHere, we multiply by two because we are only measuring lengths on a single fundamental\ndomain of the Z2 \u2295 Z2 action (instead of in the pair of fundamental domains in the previous\nline), and we interpret \u03b3i as having trace \u0393i in that domain. Yet, by construction, the arcs\n\u0393i are the arcs of the zigzags which all have the same slope, say +1. Since, by construction\nas well, we have\nl\u03a9gdh (\u0393i ) = l\u03a9g\u22121 dh (\u0393i ),\nwe conclude\nF =2\n\n\u03ba+1\nX\n\nl\u03a9gdh (\u0393i ).\n\n(5)\n\ni=0\n\nWe consider next the total translational displacement of the zigzag, i.e. the Euclidean\ndistance between a point and its image under a generator of the isometry group of \u03a9gdh or\n\u03a9g\u22121 dh . Elementary Euclidean geometry describes this quantity in terms of the the segments\nof the zigzag, as follows. Note that if we project a zigzag along one of its directions, we\nobtain a segment composed of isometric images of the the arcs of one slope, and if we\nproject in the orthogonal direction, we obtain a segment composed of isometric images of\narcs of the other slope: the translational displacement is the length of the hypotenuse of the\nright triangle with these two segments as legs. Now the total translational displacement is\nnormalized by the requirement that the translation lM (e) of the end is fixed; if \u0393 is an arc\naround an end of a fundamental domain, then lM (\u0393) = 21 (l|gdh| (\u0393) + l|g\u22121dh| (\u0393)) = l\u03a9gdh (\u0393).\nThus, lM (e) = l\u03a9gdh (\u0393)+o(1) (as \u0393 tends towards the end e) and this fixes the translational\ndisplacement length .\nIn summary, from equations (4) and (5), we know that the total length, say L+ (\u03b8), in\n\u03a9gdh of the segments {\u03930 , . . . , \u0393\u03ba} (of slope +1) is a monotone function of \u03b8 \u2208 (0, \u03c0), while\nthe length of the total displacement vector of the segments in a fundamental domain has\nlength fixed independently of the angle \u03b8. Now the difference between the endpoints of a\n12\n\n\ffundamental domain of the zigzag is described as having length lM (e) and argument given\nas arctan( LL\u2212+ ) \u2212 \u03c04 , where L\u2212 is the total length of all of the segments of the zigzag of slope\n\u22121. Thus, as L2\u2212 + L2+ = lM (e)2 , we see that the the slope of the orbit of a point in \u03a9gdh\nunder the action of the cyclic group of translations is monotone in the asymptotic angle \u03b8\nbetween the ends.\nFor the rest of the proof of Lemma 5, we will assume that the angle between the ends\nis fixed. The passage above shows that this forces the zigzag boundary to have an orbit\nwhose slope is m(\u03b80 ), which is a well-defined constant depending only on \u03b80 .\n\n3.3\n\nDeformations of Orthodisks.\n\nIn general, a domain bounded by a zigzag with orthogonal edges is known as an orthodisk.\nAn orthodisk has geometry described by the positions of its vertices {Pi }. A pair of or\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\nthodisks with conjugate edge vectors Pj Pj+1 are called conjugate orthodisks. We have\nshown in section 3.1 how a minimal surface of the type we are considering in this paper\ngives rise to a conjugate pair of orthodisks. Moreover, such a conjugate pair of orthodisks\nis quite special, as the identity map on the minimal surface descends to a conformal map\nbetween the orthodisks which takes vertices on one orthodisk, say \u03a9gdh , to corresponding\nvertices on the other orthodisk, say \u03a9g\u22121 dh . In this subsection, we will study a moduli space\nof pairs of conjugate orthodisks; these pairs will usually not be related by a conformal map\nwhich preserves corresponding vertices.\nTo introduce this space, consider a surface M \u2208 M\u03ba with \u03b8(M ) = \u03b80 , as described\nin the statement of Proposition 6. Then the domains \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh for M have zigzag\nboundaries with slopes m(\u03b80 ) as described in the previous subsection. There is also then\na 2\u03ba-dimensional family {(\u03a9gdh , \u03a9g\u22121 dh )} of pairs of domains bounded by deformations of\nthose zigzags invariant under the same group of Euclidean planar isometries as for M:\nof course, most of the pairs in this space will not be related by a conformal map which\npreserves corresponding vertices, as would be the case for the pair, say Z0 , of domains for\nM.\nWe then consider a family {Mt } of minimal surfaces containing M = M0 ; these then\ninduce, as above, a family {Zt } of such pairs of zigzags passing through Z0 , which would\ndeform through domains with zigzag boundaries. Infinitesimally, then, we can compute\n13\n\n\fthe general form of the (infinitesimal) Beltrami differential for the gdh domain and for\nits counterpart on the g1 dh domain. This pair represents a tangent direction to the pair\n(gdh, 1g dh), construed to be a point in the product of Teichmuller spaces of the quotient\ndomains.\nWith all of this background, the crux of the argument is to compute those Beltrami\ndifferentials. In particular, let us denote by, say \u03bd, the Beltrami differential prescribing the\ndeformation on the g1 dh structure, and by, say \u03bc, the Beltrami differential parametrizing\nthe deformation of the gdh structure. We then pull back \u03bd to the gdh structure via the\nassumed conformal map F and obtain a Beltrami differential F \u2217 \u03bd. Then, if \u03bc is the Beltrami\ndifferential for the gdh structure, we compute (!) F \u2217 \u03bd = \u2212\u03bc.\nThe upshot of this result is that the two domains \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh cannot remain conformally related for t 6= 0, unless the lengths of all of the segments are preserved, ie., gdh and\n1\ndh do not change, which means that the family {Mt } of minimal surfaces is infinitesimally\ng\nunmoving.\nIn particular, from F \u2217 \u03bd = \u2212\u03bc, and since \u2212\u03bc is not equivalent to \u03bc unless both are\nequivalent to zero, we conclude that neither structure has deformed. But one can check\nthat this can only mean that no periods have changed, and so, the minimal surfaces {Mt }\nhave only deformed by a congruence/homothety. That concludes the argument, at least in\noutline form.\nWe need to formalize the previous discussion. Let \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh denote the orthodisk\nstructures for the forms gdh and 1g dh, respectively. We are concerned with relating the\nEuclidean geometry of the orthodisks (which corresponds directly with the periods of the\nWeierstrass data, as in the construction above) to the conformal data of the domains \u03a9gdh\nand \u03a9g\u22121 dh . From the discussion above, since a family of minimal surfaces {Mt } will always\ngive rise to a corresponding family {(\u03a9gdh (t), \u03a9g\u22121 dh (t))} of orthodisks, it is clear that the\nallowable infinitesimal motions can be parameterized in terms of the Euclidean geometry of\n\u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh . These infinitesimal motions are given by infinitesimal changes in lengths\nof finite sides with the changes being done simultaneously on \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh to preserve\nconjugacy of the periods. The link to the conformal geometry is that a motion which\ninfinitesimally transforms \u03a9gdh , say, will produce an infinitesimal change in the conformal\nstructure. Tensorially, this tangent vector to the moduli space of conformal structures is\n\n14\n\n\frepresented by a Beltrami differential.\n3.3.1\n\nInfinitesimal pushes.\n\nHere, we explicitly compute the effect of infinitesimal pushes of certain edges on the conformal geometry. This is done by explicitly displaying the infinitesimal deformation and\nthen computing the Beltrami differential.\nIn what follows, we rotate our picture by an angle of \u03c0/4 so that all of our boundary\nedges are either horizontal or vertical. This simplifies our notation somewhat, even if it\ncomplicates the meaning of 'conjugacy'.\n\n15\n\n\fR\n3\n\nR\n5\n\nR1\nR\n4\n\n\u03b5\n\nR\n2\n\nR6\n\nFigure 1: Domain for Beltrami Differential Computation\nWe first consider the case of a horizontal finite side, say E; as in the figure above, we see\nthat the neighborhood of the horizontal side of the orthodisk in the plane naturally divides\ninto six regions which we label R1 ,...,R6 . Our deformation f\u03b5 = f\u03b5,b,\u03b4 differs from the identity\nonly in such a neighborhood, and in each of the six regions, the map is affine.

Let the space \u2206\u03ba denote the space of conjugate pairs of orthodisks\nof the type described at the opening of the argument in subsection 3.3. The two-fold\nbranched cover of the double of one of these orthodisks is, after quotient by a translation,\n17\n\n\fa surface of genus \u03ba (which branches over the sphere at a set of 2\u03ba + 2 points on an\nequator). Thus, we may regard \u2206\u03ba as a subset \u2206\u03ba \u2282 T\u03ba \u00d7 T\u03ba of the product of a pair of\nTeichm\u00fcller spaces T\u03ba ; note dim \u2206\u03ba = dim T\u03ba . Let X0 denote a pair which is related by a\nconformal map \u03b6 : \u03a9gdh \u2192 \u03a9g\u22121 dh (and which therefore defines a periodic minimal surface\nwith the appropriate ends); note that such an example may be regarded as an element\nX0 \u2208 \u2206\u03ba \u2282 T\u03ba \u00d7 T\u03ba.\nWe claim that \u2206\u03ba is transverse to the diagonal D\u03ba = {(R, R)} \u2282 T\u03ba \u00d7 T\u03ba, where of\ncourse dim D\u03ba = dim \u2206\u03ba . To see this, note that we may regard a tangent direction as\na pair (\u03bd\u0307gdh , \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh ) of Beltrami differentials, each representing a tangent direction to the\npoints [\u03a9gdh ] \u2208 T\u03ba and [\u03a9g\u22121 dh ] \u2208 T\u03ba , respectively. Yet at X0 , the points [\u03a9gdh ] and [\u03a9g\u22121 dh ]\nrepresent the identical point in T\u03ba , so we begin by computing how the Beltrami differentials\n\u03bd\u0307gdh and \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh relate to one another. To this end, consider how an infinitesimal push in\nthe sense of the previous section on an edge E defines Beltrami differentials \u03bd\u0307gdh and \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh .\nOf course, the conjugacy of \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh provides, via the formulas of that section, the\n1 dz\u0304\nnear an interior point\nbasic defining relation that if \u03bd\u0307gdh has local expansion \u03bd\u0307gdh (z) = 2b\ndz\nd\n\u03b6\u0304\nof an edge E, then also \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh (\u03b6) = 2b1 d\u03b6 at the corresponding edge. However, since X0 is\na pair of conformally related orthodisks, we may also assume, in this particular case, the\nexistence of a conformal map \u03b6 : \u03a9gdh \u2212\u2192 \u03a9g\u22121 dh which preserves the vertices. Such a\nmap takes vertical sides to horizontal sides by construction and this has the local expansion\n\u03b6 = \u00b1i|c|z + 0(|z|2 ) near an interior point of an edge. We therefore compute the pullback\nof \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh to \u03a9gdh as\nd\u03b6\u0304\n\u03b6\u0304 \u2032 dz\u0304\n\u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh (\u03b6) = \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh (\u03b6) \u2032\nd\u03b6\n\u03b6 dz\n= (\u2212\u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh (\u03b6) + h.o.t.)dz\u0304/dz\n1 dz\u0304\n=\u2212\n2b dz\nalong the edge E. We conclude that, locally in the interior of the edge E, we have \u03b6 \u2217 \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh =\n\u2212\u03bd\u0307gdh + ob (1), where ob (1) may be taken arbitrarily small. The above computation nearly\nproves that [\u03bd\u0307gdh ] = \u2212[\u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh ] as elements of the tangent space T\u03a9gdh T\u03ba = T\u03a9g\u22121 dh T\u03ba : what\nis left to prove for that conclusion is that the contributions to [\u03bd\u0307gdh ] or [\u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh ] from the\nregions R3 and R5 \u2013 and their counterparts in the other fundamental domains for the\nZ2 \u2295 Z2 group of Alexandrov reflections \u2013 is negligible. To see this, begin by noticing that\n18\n\n\four surface M is hyperelliptic, branching over the points where the Gauss map g is singular,\nie. over the images of the endpoints of the edges of the zigzags. Recall next that the pairing\nof the tangent and cotangent spaces to T\u03ba is given by integrating the product of Beltrami\ndifferentials and holomorphic quadratic differentials on M . Now, as M is hyperelliptic, the\nTaylor expansion of a holomorphic quadratic differential \u03a6 on M around (the lift of) a\ncorner of an edge is even, i.e. \u03a6 = (c0 + c2 w 2 + h.o.t)dw 2. This descends to a neighborhood\n1\n4\n2\nof a corner of the edge via the local map w = z 3 as \u03a6 = ( 19 c0 z \u2212 3 + 19 c2 z \u2212 3 + Oz (1))dz 2 .\n2\nIn terms of this expression, the terms of order O(z \u2212 3 ) and higher are easily seen to\nintegrate against [\u03bd\u0307gdh ] or [\u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh ] to negligible amounts in a small neighborhood of the\n4\nendpoints of an edge, but the term of order O(z \u2212 3 ) is more worrying. To understand that\nit also has but a negligible effect, we need to consider its effect in an entire neighborhood in\nM of an endpoint of an edge of the zigaag. In particular, we consider the development of the\nother three fundamental domains whose closures contain that point: these developments\nare obtained by reflection across the edges incident to that point. After a reflection in each\nof these edges, we obtain the development of the domain in the image of w 7\u2192 \u2212w of our\noriginal domain: it has the form in Figure 1 consisting of the regions R2 , R4 and R6 . In that\nregion, because the deformation of the relevant edge will be downwards instead of upwards,\nthe Beltrami differentials \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh and \u03bd\u0307gdh should be regarded as expressed by the formulas\nfor \u2212\u03bd\u0307 in (7). In terms of these explicit formulas and using that the map between these\ndevelopments may be written as \u03a8 : z 7\u2192 \u2212z (abusing notation by setting a = 0 in both\nformulas), we note that\n\u03a8\u2217 (\u2212\u03bd\u0307\n\nR6\n\n) + \u03bd\u0307\n\nR3\n\n= \u03a8\u2217 (\u2212\u03bd\u0307\n\nR4\n\n) + \u03bd\u0307\n\nR5\n\n= 0.\n\n(8)\n\nOn the other hand, since \u03a6 is even, we have that \u03a8\u2217 \u03a6 = \u03a6, and so we conclude that the\nR\npairing \u03a6\u03bd\u0307 between \u03a6 and either \u03bd\u0307 = \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh or \u03bd\u0307 = \u03bd\u0307gdh over the images of the regions\nR3 , R4 , R5 and R6 (in all of the fundamental domains) vanishes: the effect of \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh and\n\u03bd\u0307gdh as tangent vectors in a pairing with covectors is given by integration over (the images\nof) the regions R1 (and R2 ).\nWe conclude that for \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh and \u03bd\u0307gdh defining an infinitesimal push, we have [\u03b6 \u2217 \u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh ] =\n\u2212[\u03bd\u0307gdh ] as elements of the tangent space to T\u03ba. Further, since any deformation of X0 is given\nby a linear combination of such infinitesimal pushes, we conclude that [\u03bd\u0307gdh ] = \u2212[\u03bd\u0307g\u22121 dh ]\nas elements of the tangent space T\u03a9gdh T\u03ba = T\u03a9g\u22121 dh T\u03ba . Thus, any conjugacy-preserving\n19\n\n\fdeformation of X0 destroys the conformal equivalence of \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh to the order of\nthe deformation, a statement which implies \u2206\u03ba is transverse to the diagonal. This concludes\nthe proof of the claim.\nTo finish the proof of Proposition 4, observe any deformation Mt of minimal surfaces\nthrough M0 must preserve the conformality between \u03a9gdh (t) and \u03a9g\u22121 dh (t). Thus, by the\ncomputation above, we conclude that the tangent vector for Mt is trivial as a tangent vector\nto Teichm\u00fcller space, and moreover, the forms gdh and 1g dh are only trivially deformed.\nSince these forms suffice as Weierstrass data, we conclude that Mt deforms only by an\ninfinitesimal congruence, as desired.\nRecall the moduli spaces M(\u03b8) of pairs of surfaces (\u03a9gdh , \u03a9g\u22121 dh ) whose zigzag boundaries have orbits of points which accend at slope m(\u03b8) under the translation group. The\nparagraph above shows that M(\u03b80 ) meets the diagonal D\u03ba in T\u03ba \u00d7 T\u03ba transversely. As the\ndim(M(\u03b8)) + dim(T\u03ba) = dim(T\u03ba \u00d7 T\u03ba ), the implicit function theorem implies that there is\na curve X\u03b8 \u2208 M(\u03b8) \u2229 D\u03ba for \u03b8 near \u03b80 . By our construction of zigzags, such an element X\u03b8\nrepresents a periodic minimal surface whose ends make an angle \u03b8 with each other. This\nconcludes the proof of Proposition 4.\n\n4\n\nProperness of the angle map.\n\nIn this section, we prove the following properness result.\nProposition 7. The angle map \u03b8 : M\u03ba \u2192 (0, \u03c02 ] is proper.\nProof. Since M\u03ba consists of curves and \u03b8 : M\u03ba \u2192 (0, \u03c02 ] is a local diffeomorphism by\nProposition 4, it is sufficient to prove that if {M n }n\u2208N is a sequence of examples in M\u03ba\nwith limn\u2192\u221e \u03b8(M n ) = \u03b80 > 0, then a subsequence of the surfaces converges on compact\nsubsets of R3 /Z to a minimal surface M \u221e \u2208 M\u03ba with \u03b8(M \u221e ) = \u03b80 . Note that we choose\nthe surfaces {M n }n\u2208N so that each lies in R3 /Z and is invariant under reflection in the\nvertical annuli Ax1 , Ax2 in R3 /Z given in the statement of Proposition 3.\nAs the four ends of M n are asymptotically flat, the lifted surface Mn in R3 has area\ngrowth constant A(Mn ) = 2\u03c0. Thus, by the monotonicity formula for area of a minimal\nsurface in R3 , every Mn has at most 2\u03c0r 2 of area in balls of radius r. Hence, after choosing\n20\n\n\fr < 12 so that the balls in R3 embed in the quotient space, we see that the surfaces M n\nhave locally bounded area in R3 /Z. We now check that there are also uniform estimates\nfor the curvature of the surfaces in the sequence.\nArguing by contradiction and after extracting a subsequence, suppose that there exist\npoints pn \u2208 M n with maximal absolute curvature \u03bb2n \u2265 n; note that maximal curvature\npoints pn exist since the asymptotic curvature of the M n is zero. Consider the homothfn = \u03bbn [M n \u2229 B(pn , 1 )] in the homothetically expanded ball\netically expanded surfaces M\n2\nfn are submanifolds in the flat three-manifolds \u03bbn B(pn , 1 ), which\n\u03bbn B(pn , 12 ). The surfaces M\n2\n\u221a\nare isometric to balls B(~0, rn ) of radius rn = \u03bb2n \u2265 2n in R3 centered at the origin ~0; these\nfn to lie in B(~0, rn ) \u2282 R3 .\nballs are converging naturally to all of R3 . Consider the surfaces M\nfn have maximal absolute curvature 1 at the origin and in balls of radius r \u2264 rn\nSince the M\nhave area at most 2\u03c0r 2 , standard results (see, for example, [7]) imply that a subsequence of\nthese surfaces converges on compact subsets of R3 to a properly embedded minimal surface\nf in R3 with absolute curvature at most 1 and with absolute curvature 1 at the origin.\nM\nf is connected by the strong halfspace theorem [1]. Furthermore, since each\nThe surface M\nfn has total\nfn has the same total absolute curvature as M n \u2229 B(pn , 1 ), then each M\nsurface M\n2\nabsolute curvature less than the total absolute curvature of M n , which by the Gauss-Bonnet\nf has finite total\nformula is \u22122\u03c0\u03c7(M n ) which is the finite number 4\u03c0(\u03ba +1). In particular, M\nf is embedded and not flat, it has at least two ends which are asymptotic\ncurvature. Since M\nf has area growth constant at most 2\u03c0 and it\nto either planes or ends of catenoids. Since M\nf is a\nis not a plane, then it has exactly two ends. By Schoen's theorem [15], we see that M\ncatenoid with waist circle passing through the origin.\nWe claim that each of the Alexandrov annuli of symmetry of the M n intersect B(pn , rn )\nf. Otherwise, the surface M\nf would be\nfor n large and limit to planes of symmetry for M\nfn \u2282 \u03bbn M n , which are graphical over their projections to one\nthe limit of domains in M\nof its Alexandrov annuli of symmetry. It would then follow that the Gaussian image of\nf would lie in a hemisphere of S 2 , which is false for a catenoid. Hence, the Alexandrov\nM\nfn limit in a natural way to Alexandrov planes of symmetry\nannuli of symmetry of the M\nf which, after a translation of M,\nf we can consider to be the (x1 , x3 )- and (x2 , x3 )of M,\nplanes. Furthermore, since each component of the fixed point set of an Alexandrov annulus\nof symmetry is a simple closed convex curve, which is invariant under reflection across the\n\n21\n\n\fother such Alexandrov annulus and hence has two fixed points, then it is easy to show that,\nf is connected, the fixed point set of one of the planes of Alexandrov symmetry of M\nf\nsince M\nf. It follows that M\nf\nmust intersect the fixed point set of the other plane of symmetry of M\n\nis a catenoid with axis being either the x1 -axis or the x2 -axis (rather than with axis being\nthe x3 -axis).\nFrom the discussion in the previous paragraph, we conclude that a subsequence of the\nlocally finite integral minimal varifolds M n in R3 /Z converges to a limit minimal varifold\nM \u221e with mass density 2 at some point of the vertical circle \u03b1 = (0, 0) \u00d7 R/Z in R3 /Z. It\nfollows from the monotonicity formula for area that M \u221e is the union of two flat vertical\nannuli, not necessarily distinct and both containing \u03b1.\nWe claim that the convergence of the M n to M \u221e is smooth away from \u03b1. If not, then\nthere exists a point p \u2208 R3 /Z \u2212 \u03b1, such that, after extracting a subsequence, the absolute\ncurvature of the M n in the \u03b5 = 21 d(p, \u03b1) ball B(p, \u03b5) centered at p is at least n. Let qn\ncn = M n \u2229 B(p, \u03b5), where the function d(*, \u2202 M\ncn )|K|(*) has its maximum\nbe a point of M\np\ncn . Let \u03bbn = |K(qn )| and note\nvalue; here, |K|(*) is the absolute curvature function on M\ncn \u2229 B(qn , rn )), where rn = 1 d(qn , \u2202B(p, \u03b5)), have bounded\nthat the surfaces \u03a3n = \u03bbn (M\n2\ncurvature in the balls \u03bbn B(qn , rn ) of radius rn centered at qn . These balls converge to R3\nwith qn considered to be at the origin. The surfaces \u03a3n have absolute curvature bounded\nby 4 and have local area estimates. Our previous arguments now imply that a subsequence\nof the \u03a3n converges to a catenoid in R3 and this catenoid contains a point which is a\nlimit of points coming originally from \u03b1 = Ax1 \u2229 Ax2 . This is a contradiction, since \u03b1 is\ndisjoint from B(p, \u03b5). This contradiction proves that the surfaces M n converge smoothly\nwith multiplicity two to M \u221e , away from \u03b1.\nWe claim that M \u221e is either Ax1 or Ax2 with multiplicity two. If not, then since M \u221e\nis the union of two flat vertical annuli, the circle \u03b1 \u2282 M \u221e is contained in the intersection\nset of two distinct vertical flat annuli, and so, every point p \u2208 \u03b1 is a point in the singular\nset of convergence to M \u221e . Now, the blow up argument in the previous paragraph shows\nthat, for any \u03b5 > 0 the ball B(p, \u03b5) contains for n large, an approximately scaled down\ncatenoid in M n , and so, the total absolute curvature of M n \u2229 B(p, \u03b5) is at least 3\u03c0 for n\nlarge. Since \u03b5 is arbitrary and the total absolute curvature of M n is 4\u03c0(\u03ba + 1) which is\nfinite, we obtain a contradiction. Hence, M \u221e is Ax1 or Ax2 with multiplicity two as a limit\n22\n\n\fvarifold. (Although we do not use it here, we observe that this argument also shows, after\nchoosing a subsequence, that there are at most \u03ba + 1 distinct singular points of convergence\nof the M n to Ax1 or Ax2 , which by our earlier arguments must lie on \u03b1).\nLet N\u03b5 (\u03b1) be any fixed \u03b5 > 0 neighborhood around \u03b1. For n large, our analysis of the\nlimits \u03bbn M n shows that Mn \u2212 N\u03b5 (\u03b1) consists of four annular Scherk ends of Mn . Now,\nwe have also shown that the convergence of M n \u2212 N\u03b5 (\u03b1) to M \u221e \u2212 N\u03b5 (\u03b1) is smooth along\n\u2202(M n \u2212 N\u03b5 (\u03b1)), so the flux vectors (integrals of the conormals along each component of\n\u2202(M n \u2212 N\u03b5 (\u03b1))) are converging to either (\u00b11, 0, 0) or (0, \u00b11, 0), since those limits are the\nflux vectors of M \u221e . But these flux vectors are also the flux vectors of the ends of M n\nby the divergence theorem, and the flux vectors of the ends of M n are bounded away\nfrom (\u00b11, 0, 0), since the limit angle \u03b80 > 0. This contradiction implies that the sequence\n{M n }n\u2208N with \u03b8(M n ) \u2192 \u03b80 > 0 have uniformly bounded curvature.\nWe now prove that our original sequence {M n }n\u2208N with \u03b8(M n ) \u2192 \u03b80 > 0 converges to\nan example M \u221e \u2208 M\u03ba. Since the sequence of surfaces has uniformly bounded curvature\nand local area estimates, a subsequence converges on compact subsets of R3 /Z to a properly\nembedded minimal surface M \u221e . Recall that the sum of the lengths of the convex curves in\nMn \u2229 Axi corresponds to the flux of \u2207x(i+1) mod 2 of Mn , which is less than or equal to 2\nand is determined by \u03b8(Mn ). Since every convex curve in M n \u2229 (Ax1 \u222a Ax2 ) intersects the\nvertical circle \u03b1, these \u03ba + 1 convex curves M n \u2229 Axi converge smoothly to \u03ba + 1 convex\ncurves in M \u221e \u2229 Axi , each of length less than 2 for i = 1, 2. Moreover, the lengths of these\ncurves are also bounded away from zero, since they are planar curves and principal on Mn :\nany pinching of them would then blow up the curvature somewhere along them. Yet these\nlengths correspond to the lengths of the segments in the zigzags bounding the domains\n\u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh for Mn , so we see that these domains \u03a9gdh and \u03a9g\u22121 dh for Mn also converge\nsmoothly and without degeneration to the orthodisks of M \u221e .\nThese orthodisks, together with the implied vertex-preserving conformal map between\nthem, of course determine the Weierstrass data for a minimal surface whose geometry is\ngiven by the Euclidean geometry of the orthodisks. Here, since the limiting orthodisk has\na fundamental domain bounded by 2\u03ba + 2 nondegenerate segments of alternating slope,\nwe see that the surface M \u221e is a nondegenerate minimal surface of genus \u03ba. Further, as\nthe flux is determined (see Proposition 6) by the slope of the orbit of a vertex, and the\n\n23\n\n\forthodisks are converging smoothly, we see that \u03b8(M \u221e ) = \u03b80 .\nThis completes the proof of the proposition.\nRemark 8. We note that the flux argument given in the curvature estimate part of the\nproof of Proposition 7 implies that if, for some sequence in {M n }n\u2208N in M\u03ba we have\n\u03b8(M n ) \u2192 0, then the locally finite limit integral minimal varifold M \u221e is the annulus Ax1\nwith multiplicity two.\n\n5\n\nSmall angle examples are Scherk examples.\n\nIn this section, we prove the following result.\nProposition 9. For every \u03ba > 0, there exists an \u03b5 > 0 such that if M \u2208 M\u03ba and\n\u03b8(M ) < \u03b5, then M is a Scherk example.\nProof. Suppose M n \u2208 M\u03ba is a sequence of examples, where \u03b8(M n ) < n1 . After extracting a\nsubsequence, the M n converges to an integral varifold M \u221e . From the proof of Proposition\n7 and Remark 8, it is easy to see that M \u221e is one of the annuli Ax1 or Ax2 (with multiplicity\ntwo) of symmetry and that the limiting flux vectors to the ends of the M n converge to\nvectors in M \u221e . Hence, M \u221e corresponds to Ax1 . Modifications of the arguments used\nin the proof of Proposition 7 also show that, for \u03b1 = (0, 0) \u00d7 R/Z and n large, there\nexist \u03ba + 1 points Pn = {p1 (n), p2 (n), . . . , p\u03ba+1 (n)} \u2282 M n \u2229 \u03b1 with normal vector (0, 0, 1)\ntogether with small positive numbers \u03b51 (n), \u03b52 (n), . . . , \u03b5\u03ba+1 (n), such that for each i, the\nintersection B(pi (n), \u03b5i (n)) \u2229 M n is a compact annulus which is C 2 -close to a standard\ncatenoid with axis along the x2 -axis, which has been scaled by inverse of square root of\nthe absolute curvature at pi (n). Furthermore, after replacing by a subsequence, the surface\nS\nfn = M n \u2229 [R3 /Z \u2212 \u03ba+1 B(pi (n), \u03b5i (n))] consists of two components which are graphs of\nM\ni=1\ngradient less than n1 over their projections to the annulus M \u221e .\nfn converges smoothly to M \u221e punctured in at\nA subsequence of the (paired) graphs M\nmost \u03ba + 1 points with graphical gradients converging to zero as n \u2192 \u221e. Thus, the\ndegenerating conformal structures of M n as n \u2192 \u221e can be seen to converge to that of\ntwo copies of the annulus with nodes forming at the (limits of the) \u03ba + 1 points Pn along\n\u03b1 \u2282 M \u221e.\n24\n\n\fbn denote the Z-cover of one of the fundamental annuli of Mn and let A\nb denote\nNow let A\nbn and An are conformal half-planes, with the points\nthe limit of An . Thus, the domains A\nbn ; that sequence Pbn converges\nPn lifting to a periodic sequence Pbn of boundary points of A\nbn of lifts of the nodes Nn on the boundary of A.\nb We shall also have\nto a periodic sequence N\nbn \u2282 \u2202 A\nbn which are lifts of the points Qn \u2208 M n \u2229 \u03b1 whose\nneed of the periodic sequence Q\nbn alternate in position along\nnormal vectors are (0, 0, \u22121). Naturally, the points Pbn and Q\nbn and Q\nbn \u2192 N\nbn along with Pbn . We take the upper half-plane H as a model for A\nbn and\n\u2202A\nb and we let the images of Pbn be given by {ak,l = k + al | l = 0, . . . , \u03ba where a0 = 0 and\nA,\nbn be given by {bk,l = k + bl | l = 0, . . . , \u03ba, where\n0 < al < 1 for l > 1} and the images of Q\n0 < bl \u2264 1}. Naturally we take ak,j < bk,j < ak,j+1 < bk,j+1 for every k. These points ak,j\nand bk,j depend on n, but we will suppress the natural dependence on n until it is relevant\nand important.\nbn and An . These evidently\nAs in section 3, we consider the forms gdh and g1 dh on A\ndevelop to domains bounded by a periodic boundary, as described in \u00a7 3.1.

This sort of analysis has been carried out by Traizet\nin a number of slightly different settings (e.g. [17], [16]). Unfortunately for the brevity of\nthis argument, while we can follow his general outline, he does not seem to have treated\nthis precise case; fortunately, as all of the relevant information about the surfaces Mn is in\nthe development (9) (recall that the dh development offers no substantive restrictions), we\ncan give a full yet more elementary treatment directly from the equations (9).\nR\nR\nThe crucial condition is that \u03b3 gdh = \u03b3 1g dh for every cycle \u03b3 \u2282 M. On the annuli An ,\nthis implies that\nFgdh (\u03b1) \u2212 Fgdh (\u03b2) = Fg\u22121 dh (\u03b1) \u2212 Fg\u22121 dh (\u03b2)\nfor \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 Pn \u222a Qn : here the point is that any cycle on Mn is homologous to a linear\ncombination of arcs on the boundary connecting the vertical points of the Gauss map.\nLet us normalize the setting. We focus on four consecutive points \u03b1 \u2212 c\u03b5, \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b2 + d\u03b5;\nnaturally, each of the points depends on the parameter n, and as n \u2192 \u221e, the points \u03b1 \u2212 c\u03b5\nand \u03b1 converge to a node as do \u03b2 and \u03b2 + d\u03b5. In the natural notation, we compute\ne\u2212i\u03c0/4\n(d \u2212 c)\u03b5 log \u03b5 + higher order terms and\n2\nei\u03c0/4\nFg\u22121 dh (\u03b2) \u2212 Fg\u22121 dh (\u03b1) = c0 \u2212\n(d \u2212 c)\u03b5 log \u01eb + higher order terms.\n2\nFgdh (\u03b2) \u2212 Fgdh (\u03b1) = c0 +\n\nThus, in order that Fgdh (\u03b2) \u2212 Fgdh (\u03b1) = Fg\u22121 dh (\u03b2) \u2212 Fg\u22121 dh (\u03b1), we must have (from the\nsingular term) that d = c. As this computation holds for the interval between any pair of\npoints coalescing to a node, we find that |ak,j \u2212 bk,j |/|ak\u2032,j \u2212 bk\u2032 ,j | \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e for any\nchoice of k, k \u2032 , j and j \u2032 .\nRemark 10. This last statement reflects that the sizes of the curves (as curves in space)\nbeing pinched are (asymptotically) identical.\nBefore turning our attention to the \"small\" intervals between ak,j and bk,j , we readjust our notation, setting bk,j = ak,j + \u03b5 + \u03b7k,j where \u03b7k,j = o(\u03b5(n)) = o(\u03b5) as n \u2192 \u221e.\nAlso, being mindful of convergence issues that will eventually arise, we explicitly consider\n\n26\n\n\fapproximations\n\u00151/2 Y\n\u00151/2\nM Y\n\u03ba \u0014\nz \u2212 a0,j\n(z \u2212 ak,j )(z \u2212 a\u2212k,j )\n=e\ndz\nz \u2212 b0,j\n(z\n\u2212\nb\nk,j )(z \u2212 b\u2212k,j )\nj=0\nj=0\nk=1\n\u00151/2 Y\n\u00151/2\nZ \u03b6 Y\u0014\nM Y\n\u03ba \u0014\nz \u2212 b0,j\n(z \u2212 bk,j )(z \u2212 b\u2212k,j )\nM\ni\u03c0/4\nF\u03a9g\u22121 dh (\u03b6) = \u2212e\ndz\nz \u2212 a0,j\n(z \u2212 ak,j )(z \u2212 a\u2212k,j )\nj=0\nF\u03a9Mgdh (\u03b6)\n\ni\u03c0/4\n\nZ\n\n\u03ba \u0014\n\u03b6Y\n\n(10)\n\nk=1\n\nto the infinite vertex Schwarz-Christoffel map in (9). As the convergence of the \"partial\nproduct\" map in (10) is uniform in M with estimates independent of n (because Pn \u222a Qn\nconverge to the nodes, uniformly in n), we see that the maps in (10) provide uniformly\naccurate approximations of the maps in (9) on compacta, for M and n sufficiently large.\nWe consider the quantity F\u03a9Mgdh (bk,j ) \u2212 F\u03a9Mgdh (ak,j ) = F\u03a9Mgdh (ak,j + \u03b5 + \u03b7k,j ) \u2212 F\u03a9Mgdh (ak,j )\n(for M \u226b k) as n \u2192 \u221e, or equivalently, as \u03b5 \u2192 0.

We first aim to show that there is a unique configuration\n{ck,j } which satisfies (11), that this configuration consists of equally spaced points (to order\no(1) in M), and finally that this symmetric configuration is a non-degenerate critical point.\nTo begin, we observe that the \"force\" equations (11) may be interpreted as the vanishing\nb k,j }) = \u2212 Q(k,j)6=(k\u2032 ,j) |ck,j \u2212 ck\u2032 ,j \u2032 |\u22121 . As the ck,j are\nof the gradient for the function H({c\n|k|=M\n\nperiodic in n (at least up to the cut off M), we may regard this function as arising from\na function H with domain the simplex D = {0 = c0,0 < c0,1 < * * * < c0\u03ba < 1}. Clearly\nthe function H is proper on this simplex, and so we may expect an interior critical point\nat an interior global minimum. We now compute the Hessian of H, as equivalently, the\nM\nM\ndifferential of the map F M : D \u2192 R\u03ba+1 given by F M = (F0,0\n, . . . , F0\u03ba\n).

As this vector (\u03bb, . . . , \u03bb) represents\nonly a constant translation of the nodes to one direction or other, it is not a permissable\ndeformation in D, since we required c0,0 = 0. Thus this Hessian is negative definite on the\n(projectivized) domain D of configurations of nodes. Thus each critical point of \u2212H has\nindex 0, and so, Morse theory applied to the cell D implies that there is a unique critical\npoint.\n2\n\u03ba\n1\n, \u03ba+1\n, . . . , \u03ba+1\n) \u2208 D denote the configuration of equally spaced\nFinally let c\u2217 = (0, \u03ba+1\nM \u2217\npoints in D. We observe that Fi (c ) = o( M1 ). Thus, since the unique zero (say cM ) of\nF M is a minimum of H, it is then uniformly bounded away from \u2202D, and so we see that\ncM \u2192 c\u2217 as M \u2192 \u221e.\nWe conclude that the equally spaced point set c\u2217 is the unique limit configuration of the\nvertices {ak,j , bk,j }. Moreover, from the analysis above of the Hessians, we observe that c\u2217 is\na non-degenerate zero of the map F0,j : D \u2192 R\u03ba+1 (where we have now passed to the limit\nforce equations (12)). Thus, by the implicit function theorem, there is a unique extension of\nthis configuration to the unnoded case (9), yielding a zigzag, whose corresponding minimal\nsurface has Scherk ends making a small positive angle between them. But as the standard\nScherk examples are also such a family, and the family produced by the implicit function\ntheorem is unique, we conclude that M n = S(tn ) for n large. This completes the proof of\n29\n\n\fProposition 9.\n\n6\n\nThe proofs of Theorems 1 and 2.\n\nWe are now in a position to prove Theorem 2. By the openness result in Proposition 4, the\ncomponents of M\u03ba are curves. By properness result in Proposition 7, for each component\nC of M\u03ba, the map \u03b8 : C \u2192 (0, \u03c02 ] is a diffeomorphism. By the uniqueness result for small\nangle in Proposition 9, the only component of M\u03ba for which the restriction of \u03b8 is onto\nis the component of Scherk examples. Hence, M\u03ba consists of the component of Scherk\nexamples, which proves Theorem 2.\nAssume now that M is a connected minimal surface with A(M) < 3\u03c0. In this case,\nthe limit tangent cone C of M is a cone over an integral varifold F of S 2 , consisting of\na finite number of geodesic segments joined at the finite number of vertices of F , and at\neach vertex x0 \u2208 F , in a small neghborhood of x0 , the varifold F consists of two geodesics\ncrossing transversely. This fact follows immediately from our area growth assumption and\nthe fact that when considered to be a current, the varifold F has no boundary. From this\nlocal property at the vertices, we see immediately that F is a finite union of circles and\nour area assumption implies that there are at most two such circles, counted with possible\nmultiplicity. In particular, the area growth constant A(M) = k\u03c0, where k = 1 or 2.\nIf A(M) = \u03c0, then M is a plane by the monotonicity formula for area. So, assume now\nthat A(M) = 2\u03c0. In this case, any limit tangent cone at infinity for M consists of two\nplanes or a single plane of multiplicity two. Now assume that M has infinite symmetry\ngroup and we will prove that M is a catenoid or one of the Scherk examples.\nSince M has infinite symmetry group, then M is invariant under a continuous group\nof rotations or it is invariant under a screw motion symmetry. Assume that M is not a\ncatenoid, which is the only minimal surface of revolution. Since M is invariant under a\nscrew motion symmetry, one sees that it has a unique limit tangent cone C(M) at infinity.\nIt follows that C(M) consists of two distinct planes or a single plane of multiplicity two.\nSince the screw motion symmetry of M leaves C(M) invariant, the screw motion composed\nwith itself four times is a pure translation \u03b3 : R3 \u2192 R3 , which, after a rigid motion and\nhomothety, can be taken to be translation by the vector (0, 0, 1) that lies in \"both\" planes\n30\n\n\fin C(M).\nConsider the translational subgroup Z = {(0, 0, n) | n \u2208 N} of R3 , which leaves M\ninvariant. Note that if M = M/Z \u2282 R3 /Z has finite topology, then Theorem 2 implies M\nis a Scherk surface. So, it remains to show M has finite topology. If C(M) consists of two\ndistinct planes P1 , P2 , then the facts that each has multiplicity 1 and M is periodic imply\nthat outside of some solid cylinder \u2206 around P1 \u2229 P2 , M consists of four graphs of small\ngradient over (P1 \u222a P2 ) \u2212 \u2206, which implies M has finite topology.\nAssume now that C(M) is the (x1 , x3 )-plane P (with multiplicity two as a locally finite\nintegral varifold) and we will obtain a contradiction. Since C(M) is unique and M is\ninvariant under Z, there exists a Z-invariant regular neighborhood N(P ) whose width\naround P is a positive function W (|x1 |) which grows sublinearly in the variable |x1 |, such\nthat M is contained in the interior of N(P ). Let N(Ax1 ) in R3 /Z be the quotient regular\nneighborhood of Ax1 . Note that every annulus in R3 /Z which is parallel to Ax1 must\nintersect M , otherwise M is contained in a halfspace in R3 which contradicts the Half Space\nTheorem [1], since M is not a plane. For some R > 0 large, the circle \u03b1R = (0, R) \u00d7 R/Z\nlies outside of N(Ax1 ). For \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c02 ], let A(\u03b8) be the vertical infinite flat half annulus in\n[0, \u221e) \u00d7 [0, \u221e) \u00d7 R/Z with boundary \u03b1R and parallel to the vector (cos(\u03b8), sin(\u03b8), 0).\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that A(0) \u2229 M 6= \u2205, and so, by the maximum\nprinciple for minimal surfaces, A(0) intersects M transversely at some point. It follows that\nA(\u03b80 ) also intersects M transversely at some point for some positive \u03b80 close to 0. Since\nA(\u03b80 ) intersects N(Ax1 ) in a compact set, then there is a nonempty compact subdomain \u2206\nof M which lies in one of the bounded components of N(Ax1 ) \u2212 A(\u03b80 ). Hence, there exists\na largest \u03b81 such that A(\u03b81 ) \u2229 M 6= \u2205 and such that at every point of this intersection,\nM locally lies on one side of A(\u03b81 ). This contradicts the maximum principle for minimal\nsurfaces, which completes the proof of Theorem 1.\n\nReferences\n[1] D. Hoffman and W. H. Meeks III.
