[The criterion for a 2D Bose system\nto be \"dilute\" will be specified below.] In this way, results for thermodynamic quantities (like the critical temperature and the chemical potential) are most readily\nobtained. In addition, these results are amenable to extension to more complex systems, such as the composite\nbosons occurring in the BCS to Bose-Einstein crossover\nproblem.9 Finally, our method enables us to treat on\nequal footing the dilute Bose gas both in two and three\ndimensions.\nPrevious studies of the 2D dilute Bose gas have considered the superfluid phase either at zero temperature10\u201313\nor at finite temperature.7,14 At finite temperature, the\nabsence of a condensate in 2D required either the separation of wave-vector integration into rapid and slow\nparts,7 or the use of appropriate renormalization group\nmethods.14 Previous approaches to the 2D dilute Bose\ngas, however, did not address the following issues: (i)\nThe description of the normal phase (above the critical\ntemperature) by standard diagrammatic methods. (ii)\nUpon lowering the temperature, the detection by these\nmethods of a superfluid phase transition not associated\nwith the establishing of long-range order.\nIn this respect, standard many-body diagrammatic\nmethods prove sufficient for a complete description of\nthe normal phase of the 2D dilute Bose gas. In particular, the t-matrix approximation for the self-energy will\nbe shown to provide the correct description for a dilute\nBose gas above Tc , akin to the three-dimensional (3D)\ncase. Both in 2D and in 3D, an explicit analytic expression for the self-energy as a function of wave vector and\nfrequency will be presented.\nIn our approach, the expression (1) for the critical\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nRenewed interest in two-dimensional (2D) superfluid\nsystems has been recently prompted by the discovery of\nhigh-temperature superconductors. Before that, studying 2D bosonic systems was mainly motivated by experiments on adsorbed helium monolayers1 and spinpolarized hydrogen recombining on a helium film.2 More\nrecently, Bose condensation has been achieved experimentally in dilute gases of alkali atoms3 and in atomic\nhydrogen,4 stimulating active research in this field both\nexperimentally and theoretically.5\nEven though Bose-Einstein condensation is known not\nto occur at finite temperature for the ideal and interacting boson systems both in one and two dimensions,\nthe absence of a condensate does not necessarily imply\nthe lack of a phase transition to a superfluid state for\nan interacting 2D Bose system.6 In this system, particles with small momenta behave like a condensate and\nare responsible for the presence of a nonvanishing superfluid density.7 The critical temperature for the superfluid phase transition was estimated by Popov7 using a functional integral formalism. The same estimate\nfor the critical temperature was later obtained by Fisher\nand Hohenberg8 using a renormalization-group approach,\nwith the result\nTc \u2248\n\n2\u03c0n\n,\nm ln ln [1/(nr02 )]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n is the particle density, m the boson mass, and r0\nthe range of the interaction potential between bosons (we\nset h\u0304 = kB = 1 throughout). In these studies, Popov7\nand Fisher and Hohenberg8 approached the phase transition from the superfluid phase and the normal phase,\nrespectively.\n1\n\n\ftemperature obtained by Popov7 and by Fisher and\nHohenberg8 appears as a lower bound for the validity\nof the t-matrix as a controlled approximation for the dilute Bose gas. The ensuing diagrammatic classification\nscheme for the dilute Bose gas will, in fact, be shown\nto break down when the temperature T approaches a\nlower temperature TL , which coincides with the estimate (1) for the critical temperature given in Refs. 7\nand 8. In this way, the occurrence of a superfluid phase\ntransition enters the diagrammatic theory for the dilute Bose gas, since the physical mechanism leading to\na breakdown of diagrammatic perturbation theory can\nonly be the presence of a phase transition. In addition, by applying our method to the 3D case we obtain\n(TL \u2212 TBE )/TBE \u223c n1/3 a, where TBE is the 3D BoseEinstein temperature and a is the scattering length, in\nagreement with recent Monte Carlo simulations15,16 on\nthe 3D dilute Bose gas which yield for the critical temperature Tc the same result we obtain for TL .\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 sets up\nthe diagrammatic theory for the 2D dilute Bose gas in\nthe normal phase and calculates the corrections to the\nchemical potential and the effective mass due to the interaction. Section 3 discusses the occurrence of the superfluid phase transition for the dilute Bose gas through\na breakdown of the approximations introduced in Section 2. The value of the breakdown-temperature TL is\nthen given both in two and three dimensions. Section\n4 gives our conclusions. In the Appendix, the full dependence of the t-matrix self-energy on wave vector and\nfrequency is obtained both in 2D and in 3D by exploiting the diluteness condition. In addition, the validity of\nsome approximations on which the theoretical arguments\nof the text rely is explicitly tested numerically.\n\nWe begin by considering a 2D bosonic system interacting via a short-range two-body potential v(r) with a\nfinite range r0 , which becomes a \u03b4-function when r0 \u2192 0\n(cf. Ref. 12). We examine the dilute limit of this system,\nwhich is initially identified by the condition nr02 \u226a 1,\nwhere n is the bosonic density. [A stronger condition on\nthe parameter nr02 will be required below.] We further\nconsider temperatures above a nominal critical temperature Tc but lower than an upper temperature of the\norder of Tn \u2261 2\u03c0n/m, at which quantum effects become\nimportant.17\nUnder these assumptions, the selection of the diagrams\nyielding the leading contributions to the self-energy for\nthe 2D dilute Bose gas in the normal state proceeds along\nsimilar lines as for the 3D dilute Bose gas.\nAkin to the 3D case, also in 2D every cycle (defined\nas a closed path constructed by a sequence of \"bare\"\nbosonic propagators, with a common wave vector and\nMatsubara frequency flow) introduces a Bose function\n2\n(e(q /(2m)\u2212\u03bc)/T \u2212 1)\u22121 , which appears after the summation over the common frequency running along the cycle\nis performed. This function, in turn, cuts off the integral\nover the remaining wave-vector variable approximately\nat |q| \u2243 (mT )1/2 , which is much smaller than the cutoff 1/r0 introduced by the potential (owing to the the\ndiluteness condition and the assumption T \u223c Tn ).\nThe description of the dilute Bose gas accordingly retains only those diagrams with a minimal number of cycles, that is, just one cycle. These diagrams are shown\nin Fig. 1(a) and constitute the so-called t-matrix approximation for the self-energy.7,18\n\n+\nII. T-MATRIX APPROXIMATION FOR A\nDILUTE SYSTEM OF INTERACTING BOSONS\n\n+...\n\n+\n(a)\n\nIn this Section, we analyze the diagrammatic theory\nfor the 2D Bose gas in the normal phase and determine\nthe leading contributions to the self-energy in the dilute\nlimit. We give an analytic expression for the wave-vector\nand frequency dependence of the self-energy, which becomes asymptotically exact in the dilute limit (as verified in the Appendix). We further use the zero wavevector and frequency value of this self-energy to dress\nthe single-particle Green's functions of the theory in a\nself-consistent way. This step will enable us to identify\na lower temperature TL below which the classification of\ndiagrams for the dilute Bose system breaks down, as discussed in the next Section. In addition, we obtain the\nexplicit leading corrections to the chemical potential \u03bc\ndue to interaction, thus recovering an earlier result by\nPopov7, and to the effective mass.\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFIG. 1. (a) t-matrix approximation for the self-energy of\nan interacting Bose gas; (b) Particle-hole bubble; (c) Particle-particle bubble.\n\nAt T \u223c Tn higher-order diagrams can be estimated by\nreplacing the bare potential by the t-matrix itself and assigning to each additional cycle a factor t0 \u03a0ph (0). Here,\nt0 and \u03a0ph (0) are the zero frequency and wave-vector\nvalues of the t-matrix and of the particle-hole bubble\n(Fig. 1(b)), respectively. It will further shown below that\nthe product t0 \u03a0ph (0) \u221d 1/ ln[1/(nr02 )] \u226a 1 in the dilute\n2\n\n\flimit.\nWe will verify, however, that the classification of diagrams based on the cycle argument breaks down upon\nlowering the temperature down to a value TL . More\nprecisely, we will find that the t-matrix correctly describes the dilute Bose gas in the temperature range\n<\nTL <\n\u223c T \u223c Tn , in the sense that no other diagrams besides\nthe t-matrix itself need to be included.\nThe self-energy corresponding to the set of diagrams\ndepicted in Fig. 1(a) reads:\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u0012 \u2032\nX Z d2 q\u2032\nq \u2212 q q\u2032 \u2212 q\n\u2032\n\u2032\nG(q ) t\n,\n,q + q\n\u03a3t (q) = \u2212T\n(2\u03c0)2\n2\n2\n\u03c9\u03bd \u2032\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\nq \u2212 q\u2032 q\u2032 \u2212 q\n(2)\n,\n, q + q\u2032\n+t\n2\n2\n\n\u03a3t (0) \u2248\n\n(5)\n\nBy entering in this expression the analytic form of the\nchemical potential \u03bc0 ,21 we obtain eventually\n8\u03c0n/m\n\u2212 e\u2212Tn /T )|])\n8\u03c0n/m\n\u2248\n2\nln[1/(nr0 )] + ln[Tn /(2\u03c0T )] \u2212 ln | ln(1 \u2212 e\u2212Tn /T )|\n8\u03c0n\n\u2248\n(6)\nm ln [1/(nr02 )]\n\n\u03a3t (0) \u2248\n\nln(1/[mT r02 | ln(1\n\nthe last result holding for Tn / ln[1/(nr02 )] \u226a T <\n\u223c Tn ,\n< Tn )\nT\nwhich includes the temperature range (TL <\n\u223c\n\u223c\nof physical interest.

The only temperature dependence of \u03bc thus\noriginates from \u03bc0 . In particular, at T = Tc we substitute the value of Tc from Eq.

(2) and (3) are considered\nto be bare ones. Quite generally, self-energy insertions\nin the Green's functions become relevant when the phase\ntransition is approached. It is shown in the Appendix\nthat, in the dilute limit, the dependence of the self-energy\n\u03a3t (q) on q can be disregarded when calculating physical\nquantities, so that one may set \u03a3t (q) \u2243 \u03a3t (0) in all singleparticle Green's functions entering Eqs. (2) and (3) and\nre-absorb the constant \u03a3t (0) by a shift of the chemical\npotential. In this way, when the chemical potential is\nexpressed in terms of n and T , one obtains\n\u03bc \u2212 \u03a3t (0) = \u03bc0\n\n8\u03c0n\nm ln [1/(m|\u03bc0 |r02 )]\n\n\u03bc(Tc ) = \u03bc0 (Tc ) + \u03a3t (0)\n1\n8\u03c0n\n2\u03c0n\n+\n\u2248\u2212\n2\n2\nm ln [1/(nr0 )] ln ln[1/(nr0 )] m ln [1/(nr02 )]\n8\u03c0n\n\u2248\n,\n(7)\nm ln [1/(nr02 )]\nprovided that ln ln(1/(nr02 ) is sufficiently larger than\nunity (dilute limit). This result coincides with the value\nof the chemical potential obtained in Refs. 7,8 where the\ncritical temperature was approached from below.\nThe effective mass can eventually be calculated after\nanalytic continuation of \u03a3t (q). The result is\nm\u2217\n1\n=1+\n.\nm\n4 ln ln[1/(nr02 )]\n\n(4)\n\n(8)\n\nDetails of the derivation of Eq.

(2) and (3) to be self-consistently dressed by the\nself-energy (2) with q = 0, resulting in an \"improved\" tmatrix approximation which can be adopted to approach\nthe critical temperature more closely.\nThe explicit expression of \u03a3t (q) for arbitrary values of\nq is given by Eq. (A7) of the Appendix, which is asymptotically valid in the dilute limit. From that expression,\nthe shift of the chemical potential due to interaction as\nwell as the relevant effective mass can be obtained. For\nthe chemical potential, it is sufficient to know the value\nof \u03a3t (0), which from Eq. (A7) becomes:20\n\nIII. BREAKDOWN OF THE BOSONIC\nT-MATRIX APPROXIMATION AND THE\nSUPERFLUID PHASE TRANSITION\n\nWe pass now to show that the selection of diagrams\nmade in the previous Section, which was based on the\ncycle argument, breaks down upon lowering the temperature when the superfluid phase transition is approached.\nSpecifically, consideration of the temperature at which\nthe particle-hole diagrams (which where discarded by the\ncycle argument) are no longer negligible in comparison\n3\n\n\fwith the particle-particle diagrams, will lead us to identify a lower temperature TL that turns out to coincide\nwith the critical temperature (1) determined in Refs. 7\nand 8.\nTo determine the range of validity of the t-matrix approximation, it is enough to compare the particle-particle\nbubble \u03a0pp of Fig. 1(c) (which constitutes the building\nblock of the t-matrix of Fig. 1(a)) with the particlehole bubble \u03a0ph of Fig. 1(b). This statement follows\nfrom the classification of diagrams we have made because\nt0 \u2243 \u03a0pp (0)\u22121 in the dilute limit [cf. Eqs. (A2) and (A4)],\nyielding \u03a0ph (0)/\u03a0pp (0) as the small parameter of the theory at T \u223c Tn . The ratio \u03a0ph (0)/\u03a0pp (0) grows, however,\nupon lowering the temperature below Tn and reaches the\nvalue of unity at the temperature TL introduced above.\nThe particle-particle bubble is given by\n\u03a0pp (0) = T\n\nXZ\n\u03c9\u03bd\n\nr0\u22121\n\nd2 q\nG(q) G(\u2212q)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nTL \u2248\n\n\u03a0pp (0) =\n\n(9)\n\nr0\u22121\n\nm\n4\u03c0\nm\n\u2248\n4\u03c0\n\n\u2248\n\nd2 q 1 + 2nB (\u03be(q))\n(2\u03c0)2\n2\u03be(q)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ r0\u22121\n1\n|q| nB (\u03be(q))\n1\n+\nln\nd|q|\n2m|\u03bc0 |r02\n2\u03c0 0\n\u03be(q)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n(10)\nln\n2m|\u03bc0 |r02\n\n\u03a0pp (0) \u2248\n\nwhere nB (x) = (ex/T \u2212 1)\u22121 is the Bose function and the\nlast asymptotic equality holds in the dilute limit nr02 \u226a 1\nand for temperatures of the order of Tn (such that |\u03bc0 | \u223c\nTn ).\nThe particle-hole bubble for q = 0 is, as usual, given by\n\u03a0ph (0) = \u2202n/\u2202\u03bc. For the two dimensional Bose gas the\nchemical potential is known analytically for all temperatures and densities21 , such that\nm e\u03bc0 /T\n\u2202n\n=\n.\n\u2202\u03bc\n2\u03c0 1 \u2212 e\u03bc0 /T\n\nm\nm\n=\n2\u03c0 2 r0\n4\u03c0a\n\n(14)\n\nwhere a is the scattering length, and\n\u03a0ph (0) =\n\n2mn1/3\nTBE\n\u2202n\n\u2248\n\u2202\u03bc\n3\u03b6(3/2)4/3 T \u2212 TBE\n\n(15)\n\nsince \u03bc0 \u2243 \u22129\u03b6(3/2)2(T \u2212 TBE )2 /(16\u03c0TBE ) for the chemical potential of the ideal Bose gas (valid near the BoseEinstein temperature TBE = 2\u03c0/\u03b6(3/2)2/3 n2/3 /m). The\ntemperature at which these contributions coincide then\ndefines the 3D breakdown temperature TL3D . One obtains:\n\n(11)\n\nAt T \u223c Tn , \u03bc0 (n, Tn ) \u223c Tn and \u2202n/\u2202\u03bc \u223c m, such\nthat the ratio \u03a0ph (0)/\u03a0pp (0) \u2248 1/ ln[1/(nr02 )] \u226a 1 in\nthe dilute limit. When T \u226a Tn , on the other hand,\n|\u03bc0 | \u226a T and \u2202n/\u2202\u03bc \u2248 mT /(2\u03c0|\u03bc0 |), which is much\nlarger than the corresponding value at T \u223c Tn . A lower\ntemperature TL can thus be reached, such that the ratio\n\u03a0ph (0)/\u03a0pp (0) equals unity when\nTL\n1\n1\n=\nln\n.\n2 2m|\u03bc0 |r02\n|\u03bc0 |\n\n(13)\n\nvalid under the assumption ln ln[1/(nr02 )] \u226b 1 (which\ndefines the diluteness condition in 2D). This expression for TL coincides with the estimate (1) for the critical temperature given by Popov7 and by Fisher and\nHohenberg8 . Note that the double-log dependence of TL\non nr02 originates, on the one hand, from the log dependence of \u03a0pp (0) on |\u03bc0 | and, on the other hand, from\nthe exponential dependence of \u03bc0 on T at low temperatures. Note also that the more stringent diluteness condition ln ln[1/(nr02 ) \u226b 1 (in the place of the original\nnr02 \u226a 1) is required to get a finite temperature range\n<\n(TL <\n\u223c T \u223c Tn ), where self-energy diagrams can be selected by the diluteness condition.\nOn physical grounds, the only mechanism which may\nlead to the breakdown of the diagrammatic classification\nin terms of a small parameter (as explicitly seen above)\nis the occurrence of a phase transition. The breakdown\ntemperature TL is thus expected to provide an estimate\nfor the superfluid critical temperature Tc , also because\nthe two temperatures TL and Tc are expected to have\nthe same functional dependence on nr02 , as comparison\nof our expression for TL with the value (1) for the critical\ntemperature obtained in Refs. 7,8 indeed shows.\nOur identification of TL with Tc is further confirmed\nby applying the same sort of arguments to the 3D dilute\nBose gas, for which Monte Carlo results are available.15,16\nIn this case, the particle-particle and particle-hole bubbles are given, respectively, by\n\nwhere G(q) = (i\u03c9\u03bd \u2212 q2 /(2m) + \u03bc0 )\u22121 according to the\narguments above. With the notation \u03be(q) = |q|2 /(2m) \u2212\n\u03bc0 , we obtain:\nZ\n\nTn\nln ln[1/(nr02 )]\n\n8\u03c0\nTL3D \u2212 TBE\n=\nn1/3 a \u2243 2.33 n1/3 a .\nTBE\n3\u03b6(3/2)4/3\n\n(16)\n\nThis result agrees with recent Monte Carlo simulations\nfor the 3D hard-core Bose gas in the dilute limit,16 which\nyielded precisely (Tc \u2212TBE )/TBE = (2.3\u00b10.25)n1/3a, and\ncoincides with the analytic result of Ref. 22, which was\nobtained by a completely different method.\nThe result (16) should be regarded as altogether non\ntrivial, since previous analytic treatments of the 3D dilute Bose gas resulted either in different dependences of\n\n(12)\n\nEntering now the asymptotic expression |\u03bc0 | \u2248 T e\u2212Tn /T ,\nwhich holds for T \u226a Tn , yields eventually\n4\n\n\f(Tc \u2212 TBE )/TBE on the parameter n1/3 a, e.g., of the type\n(n1/3 a)1/2 [cf. Ref. 23] or (n1/3 a)2/3 [cf. Ref. 24], or in\nthe same linear dependence on the parameter n1/3 a, but\nwith a different proportionality coefficient.25\u201327 In our\napproach, the linear dependence on the parameter n1/3 a\nof the temperature shift has been directly related to the\nquadratic dependence of the free-boson chemical potential on T \u2212 TBE near TBE in 3D.\n\ncomplex physical situations.\nIn this respect, a possible application of our results\nmay be the normal state of high-temperature cuprate\nsuperconductors, which are quasi-two-dimensional systems.\nExperiments related to the normal28,29 and\nsuperconducting30 state in these systems suggest, in\nfact, that a correct description of their properties might\nrequire an intermediate (crossover) approach between\nthe Fermi liquid theory (weak-coupling) and the dilute Bose gas approach (strong-coupling). For this reason, crossover theories have been considered by several authors, both for the normal state31,32 and the\nbroken-symmetry phase.33,34 Since a reliable study of the\ncrossover problem should require a good knowledge of at\nleast the extreme (weak- and strong-coupling) limits, the\napproach developed in this paper might shed light on the\nstrong-coupling limit of these theories.9\n\nIV. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper, we have considered the two-dimensional\ndilute Bose gas in the normal phase, in the interesting\ntemperature region ranging from an upper temperature\nTn (below which quantum effects become important) to a\nlower temperature TL (which we have identified as the superfluid critical temperature). In this temperature region\nwe have analyzed the ordinary diagrammatic theory and\norganized it in powers of the parameter 1/ ln[1/(nr02 )],\nwhich was assumed to be small compared to unity.\nIn this way, the standard t-matrix has been identified\nas yielding the dominant set of diagrams for the selfenergy when nr02 \u226a 1. Further analysis of the theory\nto define the temperature range where the t-matrix approximation holds has, however, led us to consider the\nstronger condition ln ln[1/(na2 )] \u226b 1 as characteristic of\nthe \"dilute\" Bose gas in two dimensions, thus confirming\nthe criterion introduced by Fisher and Hohenberg8 via\ndifferent methods.\nOur identification of the lower temperature TL (and,\nthus, of the superfluid critical temperature) rests on the\nfinding that the diagrammatic classification scheme for\nthe 2D dilute Bose gas breaks down at this lower temperature, in the sense that additional diagrams (besides the\nt-matrix) become also important at TL and the hierarchy\nestablished for the dilute gas no longer holds. In this respect, it may be worth mentioning that our criterion to\nidentify the critical temperature does not contradict the\nusual criterion which defines Tc (n) as the temperature\nwhere the equation \u03bc(n, Tc ) = \u03a3(q = 0; n, Tc) is satisfied.\nSolving, in fact, for this equation requires one to rely\non an approximation for the self-energy which is valid\neven at Tc . We have seen, however, that in our case the\nt-matrix approximation for the self-energy breaks down\nbefore reaching Tc , as soon as the critical region above Tc\nis approached.\nThe finding that an estimate of the superfluid critical\ntemperature can be obtained from the ordinary diagrammatic theory in the normal phase, both in two and three\ndimensions, constitutes per se a nontrivial result, especially because the nature of the (superfluid) transition\nin two and three dimensions is quite different (involving,\nrespectively, quasi-long-range order and true long-range\norder). In addition, our approach is rather straightforward and amenable to direct implementation to more\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are indebted to C. Castellani, P.

From this expression, the effective mass (at\nq = 0) is calculated. In addition, the approximation\n\u03a3t (q) \u2243 \u03a3t (0)\n\n(A1)\n\n(which is crucial for the arguments presented in the text)\nwill be justified theoretically and checked numerically.\nBoth two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases will\nbe considered for completeness.\n1. Two dimensions\n\nIt is convenient to parametrize the short-range potential by a separable potential in wave-vector space, by\nsetting v(k \u2212 k\u2032 ) = v0 wk wk\u2032 with wk = \u03b8(k0 \u2212 |k|) and\nk0 = r0\u22121 . In this way, Eq.

(A4), af(a)\nter the replacement i\u03a9\u03bd \u2032 \u2192 z, it can be readily verified\nthat t(P, z) has a simple pole for z = P2 /(4m) + 2|\u03bc0 | +\nk02 /[m(1 \u2212 e\u22121/\u1e7d0 )] (with \u1e7d0 = mv0 /(4\u03c0)) and a branch\n0\ncut along the real axis for P2 /(4m) + 2|\u03bc0 | < Re(z) <\n2\n2\nP /(4m) + 2|\u03bc0 | + k0 /m. The frequency sum in Eq. (A5)\ncan be then performed by a contour integration, yielding\nthree distinct contributions: one from the simple pole of\n\u22120,5\nthe Green's function G(q\u2032 , z), one from the simple pole of\nthe t-matrix, and one from the integration along the cut\nof t(q + q\u2032 , z). The term originating from the simple pole\nof the t-matrix, which occurs for Re(z) > k02 /m, is expo\u22121\nnentially suppressed by the Bose factor 1/(exp(\u03b2z) \u2212 1)\nand is thus negligible. The term associated with the integration along the cut can be estimated to be smaller than\n\u22121,5\nthe term from the simple pole of the Green's function by\n0\n1\n2\n3\n0,5\n1,5\n2,5\n2\na factor 1/ ln[1/(nr0 )], and is also negligible in the dilute\nq / k0\nlimit.

As\nan example, in Fig. 2 the analytic expression for \u03a3t (q)\nis compared with the numerical results for the choice of\nparameters T = Tn , mv0 /(4\u03c0) = 1, and nr02 = 1.6\u00d710\u22123.\nOne can see that in this case the agreement is excellent.\nThe expression (A7) for the self-energy can also be\nused to verify that, when evaluating physical quantities (such as the density n), the wave-vector and frequency dependence of \u03a3t (q) is actually irrelevant, so\nthat one can approximate \u03a3t (q) \u2243 \u03a3t (0) as anticipated\nin Eq. (A1). This is because the presence of the logarithm in Eq. (A7) makes the dependence of \u03a3t (q) on q\nrather slow. The approximation \u03a3t (q) \u2243 \u03a3t (0) is thus\njustified over a large portion of q space and can be exploited to evaluate physical quantities. In particular, for\nT = Tn we have obtained numerically that the relative\nP R d2 q\nerror when evaluating n = \u2212T \u03bd (2\u03c0)\n2 G(q) alterna2\ntively with G(q) = [i\u03a9\u03bd \u2212 q /(2m) + \u03bc \u2212 \u03a3t(q)]\u22121 or with\nG(q) \u2192 G0 (q) = [i\u03a9\u03bd \u2212 q2 /(2m) + \u03bc \u2212 \u03a3t (0)]\u22121 is less\n\u22122\nthan 1% for nr02 <\n\u223c 10 .\nFinally, the t-matrix self-energy (A7) can be exploited\nto calculate the effective mass for the dilute Bose gas.\nRecall that, once the retarded self-energy is known, the\neffective mass can be calculated as35\n\u0013\u0014\n\u0015\u22121\n\u0012\nm \u2202Re\u03a3(|q|, \u03c9)\n\u2202Re\u03a3(|q|, \u03c9)\nm\u2217\n1+\n,\n= 1\u2212\nm\n\u2202\u03c9\n|q|\n\u2202|q|\n\n2. Three dimensions\n\nThe three-dimensional case can be treated in a parallel\nfashion to the two-dimensional case. By considering the\nsame separable potential adopted in 2D, and by following\nthe same steps which lead to Eq. (A4), we now obtain:\n\"\nr\nm\nP2\n1\n1/2\n\u22121\n+ 2 k0 \u2212 m\n\u2212 i\u03a9\u03bd\n\u22122\u03bc0 +\nt (P ) =\nv0\n2\u03c0\n4m\n\uf8f9\n1/2\nk0 /m\n\uf8fb\n(A12)\n\u00d7 arctan q\nP2\n\u2212 i\u03a9\u03bd\n\u22122\u03bc0 + 4m\nwhere the complex arctan is defined, as usual, in terms of\nthe principal branch of the complex logaritm as follows:\narctan z =\n\ni 1 \u2212 iz\nln\n.\n2 1 + iz\n\n(A13)\n\nLike in 2D, the t-matrix t(P, z) has a branch cut along\nthe real axis for P2 /(4m) + 2|\u03bc0 | < Re(z) < P2 /(4m) +\n2|\u03bc0 |+k02 /m, and a simple pole located along the real axis\nfor Rez > P2 /(4m) + 2|\u03bc0 | + k02 /m. Upon trasforming\nthe frequency sum in (A5) into a contour integration, the\nt-matrix simple pole contribution will be again strongly\nsuppressed by the Bose factor, while the term associated\nwith the integration along the cut can now be proven to\nbe smaller than the term originating from the simple pole\nof the Green's function by a factor (nr03 )1/2 . In the dilute\nlimit, only the simple pole of the Green's function therefore contributes to the contour integration. By the same\nargument leading to Eq. (A7), we obtain the following\nasymptotic expression for the t-matrix self-energy:\n\"\nr\nq2\n1\nm\n\u03a3t (q)\n2\n+ 2 k0 \u2212 |\u03bc0 | +\n\u2248 wq/2\n\u2212 i\u03c9\u03bd\n2n\nv0\n2\u03c0\n4m\n\uf8f6\uf8f9\u22121\n1/2\nk0 /m\n\uf8f8\uf8fb\n.

Here we\nare interested in its value at q = 0, which is relevant at\nlow temperatures.\nThe self-energy (A7) can be analytically continued via\nthe replacement i\u03c9n \u2192 \u03c9 + i0+ . The quasi-particle-pole\nequation (A9) at q = 0 can then be solved asymptotically, to yield\n\u0013\n\u0012\nln ln[1/(nr02 )]\n(A10)\n\u03c90 = \u2212\u03bc + \u03a3t (0) 1 \u2212 2\nln(1/(nr02 )]\n\u03c9q =\n\nThe asymptotic expression (A14) has also been checked\nagainst numerical calculation of Eq. (A5) in three dimensions. In Fig. 3 the analytic expression (A14) is compared\nwith the numerical results for the choice of parameters\nT = Tn , (2\u03c0 2 )/(mv0 k0 ) \u2192 0, and n1/3 r0 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\nEven in 3D the agreement is excellent.\nThe approximation \u03a3t (q) \u2243 \u03a3(0) has further been\nchecked by evaluating the particle density. In this case,\nwe have found that the error introduced by the approximation (A1) in the estimate for the density is less than\n\u22123\n1% when nr03 <\n\u223c 5 \u00d7 10 .\nFinally, the solution of the quasi-particle-pole equation (A9) at q = 0 in 3D is given by\n\nas it can be verified by inserting the value (A10) for \u03c90 in\nthe quasi-particle-pole equation and by discarding subleading terms in the dilute limit nr02 \u226a 1. The derivatives of \u03a3(q, \u03c9) at (q = 0, \u03c9 = \u03c90 ) can also be readily\ncalculated. The effective mass at q = 0 is then given by\nm\u2217\n1 + 1/(2 ln ln[1/(nr02 )])\n\u2248\n\u2248 1 + 1/(4 ln ln[1/(nr02 )]).\nm\n1 \u2212 1/(4 ln ln[1/(nr02 )])\n(A11)\nNote the occurrence of the same double-log dependence\ncharacteristic of the temperature TL .\n\n\u03c90 = \u2212\u03bc + \u03a3t (0) = |\u03bc0 | ,\n7\n\n(A15)\n\n\fFIG. 3. \u03a3(q, \u03c9\u03bd ) (units of Tn ) for a 3D dilute Bose gas at\nT = Tn and n1/3 r0 = 1 \u00d7 10\u22122 .
