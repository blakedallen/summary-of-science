Results of numerical experiments are presented.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this paper we consider a system of weakly nonlinear equations with a small positive\nparameter \u03b5:\nUt + A(U )Ux = \u03b5B(t, x, \u03b5t, \u03b5x, U, Ux , Uxx , Uxxx ),\n(1.1)\nwhere U = (u1 , u2 , . . . , un )T is a column vector, A = kaij k is an n \u00d7 n matrix, and\nB = (b1 , b2 , . . . , bn )T is a column vector. We assume that all coefficients are sufficiently\nsmooth functions.\nMany physical problems are described by such systems. We mention only some examples: dispersive waves in plasma, problems of weakly nonlinear optics, one-dimensional\ngas dynamic equations, shallow water waves. The construction of uniform asymptotic\napproximations of the solution of (1.1) becomes a nontrivial task if secular terms arise in\nthe expansion. We can illustrate this situation by considering the following linear problem\nut + ux = \u03b5u,\nu(0, x) = sin x.\n\n(1.2)\n\nWe find easily the exact solution of problem (1.2)\nu(t, x, \u03b5) = e\u03b5t sin(x \u2212 t).\nUsing a Taylor series expansion of the function e\u03b5t we get that\nu(t, x, \u03b5) = sin(x \u2212 t) + \u03b5t sin(x \u2212 t) +\nCopyright c 2001 by A Krylovas and R \u010ciegis\n\n\u03b52 t2\nsin(x \u2212 t) + * * * .\n2\n\n(1.3)\n\n\fAsymptotic Approximation of Hyperbolic Weakly Nonlinear Systems\n\n459\n\nThis expansion has secular terms \u03b5t, \u03b52 t2 , . . ., and therefore the formula (1.3) is asymptotical only if \u03b5t \u226a 1. In this case we have that\nu(t, x, \u03b5) = sin(x \u2212 t) + O(\u03b5t).\nFor \u03b5t = O(1) this expansion is not asymptotical. On the other hand the problem (1.2)\nhas a classical solution in any domain\n0 < t + |x| < c0 /\u03b5,\nhere c0 is a constant. It is easy to prove that\nlim u(t, x, \u03b5) 6= sin(x \u2212 t).\n\n\u03b5\u21920\n\nTherefore it is a nontrivial task to construct\u0001 an asymptotical approximation, which is\nuniformly valid in the region t + |x| = O \u03b5\u22121 .\nThe basic idea of all asymptotic methods is to introduce new \"slow\" variables, e.g.,\n\u03c4 = \u03b5t, \u03be = \u03b5x, and to define explicitly the dependence on \"fast\" variables. For example\nin [21] the solution is obtained in the following form:\n\u0001\nuj = \u03c8j (\u03b6, \u03b7j ) + O(\u03b5),\n\u03b6 = \u03b51+a t,\n\u03b7j = \u03b5a x \u2212 \u03bbj t + \u03b51\u2212a \u03c6(t, x) .\n\nSubstituting these expressions into system (1.1), using a Taylor expansion with respect to\n\u03b5, and equating coefficients at \u03b5j we get equations for new unknown functions \u03c8j\n\u03c8j\u03b6 + (\u03b1j \u03c8j + \u03b2j )\u03c8j\u03b7j + \u03b3j \u03c8j\u03b7j \u03b7j \u03b7j + \u03b4j \u03c8j = 0.\n\nOur goal is to approximate the initial nonlinear problem by some fundamental equations, for which the analytical solution exists. The Burgers' equation and the Korteweg-de\nVries equations are examples of such problems. Most asymptotical methods are based on\nphysical assumptions and no strict mathematical proofs of the validity of these approximations are given [2, 11]. Important applications of asymptotic methods are given in\n[6, 8, 19]. A survey of mathematical results on asymptotic expansion methods is presented by Kalyakin in [12], see also Keworkian and Cole [13]. Similar problems arise\nnot only for systems of equations, but also for semilinear perturbed wave equations, the\ntelegraph equation and weakly nonlinear beam equation [3, 7, 18].\nUsually application of formal asymptotic method reduces the initial problem to a single\nnonlinear wave equation [21]. Our method reduces problem (1.1) to the integro-differential\nsystem of averaged equations. A new problem can be seen as a more difficult problem,\nthan the initial formulation. However, we will show that the averaged system disintegrates\ninto independent equations in the non-resonance case. Moreover, our method allows to\ndescribe accurately the resonance interaction of waves, as well. Our internal averaging\nmethod is close to the multiple-scale method, which is used for similar problems in [7]. The\napplication of internal averaging method for solving gas dynamic equations is presented\nin [5].\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the general\naveraging scheme. We propose the averaging operators and compare our scheme with the\nother similar methods. In Section 3, we consider the resonance case, when the averaged\nsystem is connected. Section 4 deals with the application of the proposed algorithm for a\nshallow water model. It is proved that the initial system is ill-posed, hence the regularized\nmodel is formulated. The averaged system also gives a nontrivial regularization of the\nshallow water model. Finally we give the results of numerical experiments.\n\n\f460\n\n2\n\nA Krylovas and R \u010ciegis\n\nMethod of averaging\n\nLet U0 be a constant solution of equation (1.1):\nB(t, x, \u03b5t, \u03b5x, U0 , 0, 0, 0) = 0.\n\n(2.1)\n\nWe assume that problem (1.1) is hyperbolic in the neighborhood of U0 , i.e. there exists\nan n \u00d7 n matrix R = krij k det R 6= 0 such that\n\u039b \u2261 diag {\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbn } = RA(U0 )R\u22121 .\n\n(2.2)\n\nWe are interested in finding a small-amplitude wave solution\nU (t, x, \u03b5) = U0 + \u03b5U1 (t, x, \u03b5).\n\n(2.3)\n\nLinearizing equations (1.1) with respect to U0 yields the system of equations\nVt + \u039bVz = \u03b5F (t, x, \u03b5t, \u03b5x, V, Vx , Vxx , Vxxx ) + o(\u03b5),\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere V = RU1 , and the function F is given by\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nF = \u2212RA1 R\u22121 V R\u22121 Vx + R B0 R\u22121 V + B1 R\u22121 Vx\n\u0003\u0001\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n+ B2 R\u22121 Vxx + B3 R\u22121 Vxxx ,\n\u0015\nn \u0014\nX\n\u2202\ndA(U0 )\nA1 [U1 ] \u2261\nU1 =\naij (U0 ) u1k ,\ndU\n\u2202uk\nk=1\n\nb0j\n\nBm [U1 ] = (bm1 , bm2 , . . . , bmn )T ,\nn\nX\n\u2202bj (t, x, \u03b5t, \u03b5x, U0 , 0, 0, 0)\n=\nu1k ,\n\u2202u0k\nk=1\n\nb2j =\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2202bj\nu1kxx ,\n\u2202u0kxx\n\nb3j =\n\nm = 0, 1, 2, 3,\nn\nX\n\u2202bj\nb1j =\nu1kx ,\n\u2202u0kx\nk=1\n\nn\nX\nk=1\n\n\u2202bj\nu1kxxx .\n\u2202u0kxxx\n\nIf \u03b5 = 0, then system (2.4) with the initial condition\nV (0, x, \u03b5) = V0 (x)\n\n(2.5)\n\ndescribes n independent linear waves vj = v0j (x \u2212 \u03bbj t).\nIf t+|x| \u223c \u03b5\u22121 , then the exact solution of initial-value problem (2.4), (2.5) (and therefore\nalso of problem (1.1)) is not close to the simple wave.

For comparison the classical averaging along characteristics [16] is\ndefined by:\nZ\n1 T\ng(\u03c4, \u03be, s, yj + \u03bbj s, v(\u03c4, \u03be, t, x))ds\nlim\nT \u2192\u221e T 0\nand it can be called the external averaging.\nWe illustrate the difference between these two techniques, by considering the model\nsystem with the internal resonance\nut + ux = \u03b5v sin x,\nvt = 0,\n\nu(0, x, \u03b5) = 0,\n\nv(0, x) = sin x.\n\nThe external averaging gives the problem\nUt + Ux = 0,\n\nU (0, x) = 0\n\nand U \u2261 0 does not approximate the exact solution\n\u03b5\nu(t, x, \u03b5) = (2t + sin 2(x \u2212 t) \u2212 sin 2x)\n4\nif t \u223c \u03b5\u22121 .

If it is satisfied,\nthen averaged system (2.8) disintegrates into independent equations, which are similar to\n(2.12).\nIt was proved in [15], that the class of functions M, for which the internal averaging\ncan be applied, includes almost periodic functions. For example, let assume that\nfj = \u03c1j (\u03c4, \u03be, t, x)u1 u2 * * * un ,\nu0j \u223c\n\n\u03c1j =\n\nX\n\nl=(lt ,lx )6=0\n\nX\nk\u2208Z\n\n0\n\nujk (\u03be)ei\u03bdjk x .\n\nx x)\ni(\u03bd t t t+\u03bdjl\nx\n\n\u03c1j (\u03c4, \u03be)e\n\njl\n\n,\n\n\f464\n\nA Krylovas and R \u010ciegis\n\nThen system (2.6) is non-resonance if\n\u2200 lt , lx , lk \u2208 Z\n\n|lt | + |lx | +\n\nx\nt\n\u03bdjl\nt + \u03bdjlx \u03bbj +\n\nX\nk6=j\n\nX\nk6=j\n\n|lk | =\n6 0:\n\n0\n(\u03bbj \u2212 \u03bbk ) 6= 0.\n\u03bdkl\nk\n\n(3.4)\n\nThus our method treats uniformly both the resonance and non-resonance problems.\nThe mathematical justification of the method was given only in the case, when the operator B in system (1.1) does not depend on Uxx and Uxxx . But our results for non-resonance\nsystems coincide with the results given by some other methods. Therefore we expect that\nasymptotic solution approximates uniformly the exact solution in more general cases too.\nThe numerical analysis of such problems will be given in the next section.\n\n4\n\nShallow water waves\n\nIn this section we consider the system of shallow water equations [1]\nZt + (HU )x = \u03b5\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0001\n1\n1\n3\nH Uxx x \u2212 (HU )xxx \u2212 HHx (HU )xx \u2212 (ZU )x ,\n6\n2\nUt + Zx = \u2212\u03b5U Ux ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere z = \u03b5Z is the water surface level, u = \u03b5U is the horizontal velocity of the fluid, H is\nthe normalized bottom equation.
