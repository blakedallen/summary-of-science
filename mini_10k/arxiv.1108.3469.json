It may be possible to control the number of stacked IJJs\nwith an accuracy of a single IJJ by developing this method.\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIntrinsic Josephson junctions (IJJs) have been regarded as high quality Josephson junctions because of\ntheir atomically flat structure1 . Macroscopic quantum\ntunneling (MQT) has been reported in small IJJ stacks in\nrecent years2\u20138 and has attracted attention9\u201313 because of\nthe existence of new quantum phenomena3 and the possibility of an \"intrinsic phase qubit\" working at higher\ntemperatures.\nBi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+y (BSCCO) has often been chosen for\nthose MQT studies, because one can easily cleave the\ncrystals with Scotch tape to prepare thin and flat crystals. In fact obtaining thin and flat crystals is the crucial\npoint in the fabrication process to form a small s-shaped\nIJJ stack either using focused ion beam (FIB) etching\ntechnique14 or using double sided cleaving method, i.e.,\nargon ion etching15,16 . Because of this, much less experimental studies using IJJ stacks of other cuprates have\nbeen done.\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO) is known as a material having\nlarge Josephson plasma frequency \u03c9p reaching THz17,18 .\nThe quantum fluctuations in phase space are proportional to \u03c9p 19,20 ; a Josephson junction having larger \u03c9p\nmay let us perform qubit operations at higher temperature. Therefore LSCO is one of the favorable materials\nto be implemented as intrinsic phase qubits. However\nan LSCO IJJ stack cannot easily be fabricated since it\n\na) Present\n\naddress: Service de Physique de l'Etat Condens\u00e9\n(SPEC), CEA-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette 91191, France.\nb) Present address: Department of Applied Physics, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo 184-8588, Japan.\nc) Present address: Department of Quantum Engineering, Nagoya\nUniversity, Nagoya 464-8603, Japan\nd) Present address: Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin f\u00fcr Materialien und\nEnergie GmbH, 14109 Berlin, Germany\n\nis difficult to cleave the bulk crystal by Scotch tape, unlike BSCCO. This means that the double sided cleaving\ntechnique15,16 cannot be applied to LSCO. Indeed only a\nfew experimental studies fabricating s-shaped LSCO IJJ\nstacks in bulk crystals have been reported21\u201324 . Another\npossibility is to use thin films but a priori this is not\na good solution because the grain boundaries cannot be\nneglected25,26 .\nIn this article, (1) we report success in fabricating an\nLSCO IJJ stack in a bulk crystal with submicron lateral\ndimensions by FIB etching, and (2) we propose a new\nmethod to fabricate a submicron LSCO IJJ stack using\nboth FIB etching and argon ion etching. The IJJ stacks\nhave the smallest lateral dimensions reported so far, and\nthe new fabrication method allows us to control the number NIJJ of stacked LSCO IJJs with high precision. This\nnew method could also be applied to other cuprate materials such as REBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212y (RE: rare earth) compounds, which can hardly be cleaved by Scotch tape, unlike BSCCO.\n\nII.\n\nSAMPLE PREPARATION\n\nTo carve out an s-shaped IJJ stack in an LSCO single crystal using the FIB etching technique14 , we need\nto prepare a specimen which is thin along the c-axis.\nThe desired thickness is . 30 \u03bcm, because of the slow\netch rate of the FIB system27 . Figure 1 shows the process to prepare thin LSCO specimens. An LSCO single crystal grown by the traveling solvent floating zone\nmethod28 , with nominal Sr concentration x = 0.09, was\ncut and formed into a small rectangular parallelepiped\nshape. The dimensions are about 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 3 mm3 , and\nthe long edge is along the c-axis [Fig. 1(a)]. The direction of the crystal c-axis was determined by X-ray Laue\ndiffraction patterns before cutting.\nThe small rod was fixed onto a metal plate with epoxy\n\n\f2\n(c)\n\n(a)\n\n(a)\n\nSilver epoxy\n\nFIB etching\n\nCO\n\nLS\nc\n\nI+\nIV-\n\nEpoxy adhesive\n\n(b)\n\nab - plane\n\nSilver epoxy\n\n1.5 \u00b0\n\nMicro bridge\n\nV+ gO\nM\n\nc\n\nLSCO\n\n(d)\n\n(b)\n\n(b)\n\nadhesive (Torr Seal, Ideal Vacuum Products), and carefully cleaved as schematically depicted in Fig. 1(a). A\nshiny flat surface, an indication of the ab-plane, appeared\nafter cleaving as shown in Fig. 1(b). Tiny crystal pieces\nwere obtained by cutting the flat part using a wire saw.\nThe typical lateral dimension of these pieces is 0.05 - 0.1\nmm, and the typical thickness is 20 - 50 \u03bcm. One of the\npieces was fixed on a magnesium oxide (MgO) substrate\nby polyimide glue, and four electrical contacts were made\nby silver epoxy as shown in Fig. 1(c) and 1(d). To reduce\ncontact resistance, we annealed the sample at 400 \u25e6 C for\n10 minutes in oxygen in a mirror furnace (MILA-3000,\nUlvac).\n\nIII. FABRICATION OF A SUB-MICRON LSCO IJJ\nSTACK BY FIB ETCHING\n\nWe used a focused a FIB/scanning ion microscope\n(FIB/SIM) system (SMI-9800SE, Seiko instruments) for\nboth etching and observation. First a constricted microbridge was formed in the center of the sample as shown\nin Fig. 2(a). The length of the bridge is about 5 \u03bcm\nand the width is about 1 \u03bcm. Then we etched the microbridge from the ab direction in order to make two slits,\nas depicted in Fig. 2(b). The two slits are separated\nby \u223c 0.9 \u03bcm. Finally the micro-bridge was etched from\nthe c direction again, to narrow the width down to \u223c\n0.5 \u03bcm. Here the beam angle is slightly (\u223c 1.5\u25e6 ) tilted\nto compensate for the finite angle of the ion beam, as\n\na (b)\n\na (b)\n\na (b)\n\n(d)\n\nF#29\n\nc\n1 \u03bcm\n\n50 \u03bcm\n\nFIG. 1.

(b) An optical microscope image after cleaving.\nA shiny surface of the ab-plane is obtained as shown inside\nthe dotted square. (c) Tiny specimens are cut out from the\ncleaved rod by a wire saw, and one of the tiny pieces is fixed\nonto the substrate by polyimide adhesive.

This\npicture shows a cross-section of the micro bridge viewed from\nthe direction of the dotted arrow in (a). The micro-bridge is\nslightly (\u223c 1.5\u25e6 ) tilted to compensate for the finite angle of\nthe ion beam. (d) A scanning ion microscope image of the IJJ\nstack \"F#29\". The right hand shows the crystal structure of\nLSCO and a schematic of the IJJ array.\n\nschematically shown in Fig. 2(c).\nSince the two slits overlap slightly along the c-axis, an\napplied current I flows along the c direction in-between\nthe slits as shown by the red arrow in Fig. 2(d). Therefore the small area can be regarded as an s-shape IJJ\nstack14\u201316 as schematically depicted on the right hand\nside in Fig. 2(d). The lateral dimension of the LSCO\nIJJ stack \"F#29\" is 0.45 \u00d7 0.95 \u03bcm2 . The thickness is\nabout 30 - 40 nm, estimated from SIM images. To our\nknowledge, this is the first report of a submicron LSCO\nIJJ stack formed in a bulk crystal.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSIONS FOR F#29\n\nFigure 3 shows a current-voltage (I \u2212 V ) characteristic\nof F#29 at 0.7 K. A sharp voltage jump (the dashed\narrows in Fig. 3) and a large hysteresis (the solid arrows\nin Fig. 3) are observed. These features suggest that\nthe small structure fabricated acts as a stack of tunnel\nJosephson junctions, similar to BSCCO IJJ stacks1,15 .\nTherefore F#29 can be regarded as a submicron LSCO\nIJJ stack.\nResistive multi-branches1 do not appear in F#29. On\nthe contrary, we recognize that all the junctions simultaneously switch to their resistive state (dotted arrows\nin Fig. 3). This fact implies that all the IJJs have the\nsame critical currents; therefore our LSCO crystal has\nhomogeneous carrier density, and the LSCO IJJ stack\nwas fabricated without any extra damage such as resid-\n\n\f3\n\nF#29\n\n(a)\n\nI\n\n@0.7 K\n\nc\na (b)\n\nLSCO\n\na (b)\n\n(c)\n\nAr ion beam\nCaF2\n\nIR\n\nFIB\n\nV\n\n(b) FA#8\n\nX: 50 mV/div\nY: 100 \u03bcA/div\n\nual gallium ions. A similar switching phenomenon has\nbeen already reported in uniform BSCCO stacks, and referred to as \"uniformly switching\" by Jin et al.3 . As the\n2\ngreat enhancement of the MQT rate proportional to NIJJ\n(NIJJ : the number of stacked IJJs) was observed in the\nBSCCO uniform stacks3 , the unconventional and interesting quantum phenomenon may also emerge in LSCO\nIJJ stacks.\nAnother feature of F#29 is the large retrapping current\nIR (see the arrow in Fig. 3). In underdamped JJ's, the\nfluctuation free retrapping current IR0 is given by29\n4Ic0\n,\n\u03c0Q\n\na (b)\n\nIJJ stack\nc\n\nFIG. 3. (Color online) A snapshot of an I \u2212 V curve of the\nLSCO IJJ stack #F29. The arrows indicate the course of the\ncurrent ramp. The retrapping current IR is represented by\nthe yellow arrow.\n\nIR0 '\n\nc\n\n(d)\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Ic0 is the fluctuation free critical current, and Q\nis the quality factor of the junction. From Eq. 1 and\nFig. 3, Q of F#29 is roughly estimated to be 3 - 4. This\nmeans that the LSCO IJJ stack is moderately damped.\nDiscussing about the damping effect in the LSCO IJJ\nstack here is beyond the scope of this article. The damping effects of BSCCO IJJ stacks as well as various types\nof Josephson junctions have been intensively studied by\nKrasnov et al 29 .\n\na (b)\n\nIn section III, we described the fabrication process for\nan LSCO IJJ stack using only FIB etching. A typical\nspatial resolution of the FIB machine, however, is about\n10 - 50 nm. This is rather coarse with respect to the\nthickness of a single IJJ of LSCO, \u2248 0.7 nm. Therefore\nit is extremely difficult to control NIJJ using the FIB machine. Because of the new quantum phenomenon mentioned earlier3 , controlling NIJJ of an LSCO IJJ stack\nis an interesting although difficult challenge. Here, we\npresent a developed fabrication method in which argon\nion etching is performed after FIB etching in order to\ngradually increase the thickness of the LSCO IJJ stack.\n\nI\n1 \u03bcm\n\nFIG. 4. (Color online) A schematic of the developed process.\n(a) FIB etching was performed from the direction of the a(b)axes to form two slits. Here the two slits do not overlap\nalong the c-axis. (b) A SIM image of \"FA#8\" [taken after\nthe process (a)]. (c) Argon ion etching to develop the upper\nslit. (d) An LSCO IJJ stack with a small number of junctions\nis formed.\n\nAfter making a micro bridge with 0.7 \u03bcm width by the\nsame procedure described in section III and Fig. 2(a),\ncalcium fluoride (CaF2 ) was evaporated through a metal\nmask in order to make a protection layer for the electrodes. Then two slits were formed by FIB etching as\nschematically depicted in Fig. 4(a). In Fig. 4(b) we\nshow a SIM image of the sample \"FA#8\" taken after the\nprocess of Fig. 4(a). The distance between the slits is 0.5\n\u03bcm. Note that the two slits do not overlap along the caxis, i.e., the IJJ stack is not yet formed at this point. In\nthe next step, the depth of the top slit was gradually increased using an argon ion etching machine (MPS-3000,\nIon tech) as schematically shown in Fig. 4(c). As a result,\na submicron LSCO IJJ stack with small NIJJ is formed\nas depicted in the center of Fig. 4(d).\n\nVI.\nV. FABRICATION OF AN LSCO IJJ STACK BY FIB\nAND ARGON ION ETCHING\n\na (b)\n\nDISCUSSIONS FOR FA#8\n\nThe resistance versus temperature (R - T ) curves of\nFA#8 are shown in Fig. 5. The black dashed curve in\nFig. 5 represents the resistance of the micro bridge before making the two slits, as in Fig. 2(a). The red dotted\ncurve in Fig. 5 shows the resistance after making the two\nslits and 3 min of argon ion etching [see Fig. 4(c)]. One\ncan see that the resistance drastically increases. Figure\n6(a) represents the I \u2212 V characteristic at this point. A\ntiny voltage jump without hysteresis, which is similar to a\nweak-link junction, appears. This implies that the LSCO\nIJJ stack starts being formed, but at this point the thickness is almost zero. The green solid curve in Fig. 5 is after three more min etching (6 min total).

Figure 6(b) and (c) show the I \u2212 V curves after\netching for 6 min total. Resistive multi-branches emerge,\nand these are quite distinguishable, especially in the low\nvoltage regime of 0 to 30 mV as indexed in Fig. 6(c).\nThese results both the R \u2212 T curves and the I \u2212 V curves\nsuggest that the depth of the upper slit has increased\nalong the c-axis by the argon ion etching and eventually\nan LSCO IJJ stack is formed as schematically depicted\nin Fig. 4(c).\nThe superconducting transition temperature Tc in Fig.\n5 is recognized to be 24 K, which is taken from the midpoints of the transitions. The Sr concentration of FA#8\nis thus estimated to be x \u2248 0.0930 , and is consistent with\nthe nominal value. We note that Tc of all three curves\ndoes not change, implying that argon ion etching does not\naffect the carrier density of the crystal. This is a great\nadvantage for iterative experiments, such as in Ref.16 , as\nwell as for applications.\nIn Fig. 6(c), we determine that NIJJ is about 15. At\nhiger voltage, the gaps between each resistive brach are\nnarrower. This is probably attributed to self-heating of\neach LSCO IJJ, as is the case for BSCCO. Assuming\nNIJJ \u2248 15, we roughly estimate the etching rate of our\nargon ion etching machine to be about 3.5 nm/min. With\nproper values of the acceleration voltage and ion beam\ncurrent, we should be able to etch LSCO crystals with an\netch rate of 0.7 nm/min, namely 1 IJJ/min, as already\ndemonstrated for BSCCO by You et al.16 . Thus this\nmethod may let us control NIJJ of an LSCO IJJ stack\nwith an accuracy of single IJJ.\nIt is interesting that the resistive multi branches are\nnot observed when ramping up the bias current, but observed only while ramping down, as we can see in Fig.\n6(b) and (c).

The numbers show indexes\nof the Nth resistive branch.\n\nthe IJJ stack jumps to around 40 mV and goes up to\nthe maximal voltage (\u223c 100 mV) with chaotic behavior\n[arrow 2 in Fig. 6(c)]. Then it goes down to the superconducting state while showing multi-branches [arrow 3\nin Fig. 6(c)]. We have already reported a similar feature\nof I \u2212 V characteristics in a larger (\u2248 3 \u03bcm2 ) LSCO IJJ\nstack23 , and this phenomenon may be attributed to the\nstrong interaction among stacked IJJs31 . Further studies\nare needed to understand this.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn conclusion, we successfully fabricated submicron\nLa2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO) intrinsic Josephson junction\n(IJJ) stacks either by focused ion beam (FIB) etching\nor by an original combined FIB/argon ion beam etching\ntechnique. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of submicron LSCO IJJ stacks. About 15 resistive\nmulti-branches appeared in the sample fabricated by the\nlatter technique. This method may let us control the\nnumber of stacked LSCO IJJs with an accuracy of a single\nIJJ. This method could also be applied to other cuprate\nmaterials which are difficult to cleave with Scotch tape,\n\n\f5\nsuch as rare earth compounds REBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212y (RE: rare\nearth) as well as other Lanthanum compounds.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partially supported by MEXT under\nGrant No. 1905014.
