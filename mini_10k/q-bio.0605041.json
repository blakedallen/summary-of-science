This process of neutral evolution is an important mode of genetic change, and\nforms the basis for the molecular clock. We present a mathematical theory that predicts the\nnumber of accumulated mutations, the index of dispersion, and the distribution of stabilities in\nan evolving protein population from knowledge of the stability effects (\u2206\u2206G values) for single\nmutations. Our theory quantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable\nproteins, and provides formulae for calculating how fluctuations in stability can overdisperse\nthe molecular clock. It also shows that the structural influences on the rate of sequence evolution observed in earlier simulations can be calculated using just the single-mutation \u2206\u2206G\nvalues. We consider both the case when the product of the population size and mutation rate\nis small and the case when this product is large, and show that in the latter case the proteins\nevolve excess mutational robustness that is manifested by extra stability and an increase in the\nrate of sequence evolution. All our theoretical predictions are confirmed by simulations with\nlattice proteins. Our work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding how protein\nbiophysics shapes the process of evolution.\n\n3\n\n\fINTRODUCTION\n\nProteins evolve largely through the slow accumulation of amino acid substitutions. Over evolutionary time, this process of sequence divergence creates homologous proteins that differ\nat the majority of their residues, yet still fold to similar structures that often perform conserved biochemical functions (L ESK and C HOTHIA 1980). The maintenance of structure and\nfunction during sequence divergence suggests that much of protein evolution is neutral in\nthe sense that observed sequence changes frequently do not alter a protein's ability to fold\nand adequately perform the biochemical function necessary to enable its host organism to\nsurvive. This comparative evidence for neutrality in protein evolution has been corroborated by experimental studies showing that the mutations separating diverged sequences often have no effect other than modest and additive changes to stability (S ERRANO et al. 1993),\nand that a large fraction of random mutations do not detectably alter a protein's structure or\nfunction (S HORTLE and L IN 1985; PAKULA et al. 1986; L OEB et al. 1989; G UO et al. 2004;\nB LOOM et al. 2005; B LOOM et al. 2006). In this respect, it seems that protein evolution should\nbe well described by Kimura's neutral theory of evolution, which holds that most genetic\nchange is due to the stochastic fixation of neutral mutations (K IMURA 1983). One of the\nkey predictions of the neutral theory is that assuming a constant mutation rate, the number of mutations separating two proteins should be proportional to the time since their divergence (K IMURA 1983). Indeed, the observation by Z UCKERKANDL and PAULING (1965)\nthat proteins are \"molecular clocks\" that accumulate mutations at a roughly constant rate\nhas long been taken as one of the strongest pieces of evidence supporting the neutral the-\n\n4\n\n\fory (O HTA and K IMURA 1971).\nHowever, mutations that are neutral with respect to a protein's capacity to perform its biological function often affect protein thermodynamics. The biological functions of most proteins\ndepend on their ability to fold to thermodynamically stable native structures (A NFINSEN 1973).\nYet natural proteins are typically only marginally stable, with free energies of folding (\u2206Gf )\nbetween -5 and -15 kcal/mol (F ERSHT 1999). Most random mutations to proteins are destabilizing (G ODOY-RUIZ et al. 2004; PAKULA et al. 1986; M ATTHEWS 1993; K UMAR et al. 2006),\nand their effects on stability (measured as \u2206\u2206G, the \u2206Gf of the mutant protein minus the \u2206Gf\nof the wildtype protein) are frequently of the same magnitude as a protein's net stability. The\nimpact of a mutation on a protein's function can therefore depend on the protein's stability: a\nmoderately destabilizing mutation that is easily tolerated by a stable parent protein may completely disrupt the folding of a less stable parent. This effect of protein stability on mutational\ntolerance has been verified by experiments demonstrating that more stable protein variants are\nmarkedly more robust to random mutations (B LOOM et al. 2005; B LOOM et al. 2006).\nThe fact that mutations that are neutral with respect to direct selection for protein function\ncan affect a protein's tolerance to subsequent mutations is not consistent with the simplest formulation of the neutral theory of evolution, which tends to assume that the fraction of mutations\nthat is neutral remains constant in time. K IMURA (1987) himself recognized the possibility that\nthe neutrality might change, and TAKAHATA (1987) mathematically treated the consequences\nof a \"fluctuating neutral space\". In particular, Takahata showed that fluctuating neutrality could\nexplain the observed overdispersion in the molecular clock (C UTLER 2000b) (the tendency for\n\n5\n\n\fthe variance in the number of fixed mutations to exceed the expectation for the Poisson process\npredicted by the neutral theory) long considered troublesome for the neutral theory. However,\nfurther progress on this topic was stymied by the lack of a specific model for how or why\nprotein neutrality might fluctuate.\nMore recently, researchers have preferred to describe neutral evolution using the concept of \"neutral networks,\" which are networks in the space of possible protein sequences\nin which each functional protein is linked to all other functional proteins that differ by only a\nsingle mutation (S MITH 1970; H UYNEN et al. 1996; G OVINDARAJAN and G OLDSTEIN 1997;\nVAN\n\nN IMWEGEN et al. 1999; B ORNBERG -BAUER and C HAN 1999; T IANA et al. 2000; BASTOLLA et al. 2002).\n\nA neutrally evolving protein population is then envisioned as moving on the neutral network, and the neutrality of the population may fluctuate if the nodes on the network differ\nin their connectivities. A general theoretical treatment of evolution on neutral networks by\nVAN\n\nN IMWEGEN et al. (1999) has shown that if the product of the population size and muta-\n\ntion rate is small then members of the population are equally likely to occupy any node, while if\nthis product is large then the population will preferentially occupy highly connected nodes (see\nalso (B ORNBERG -BAUER and C HAN 1999; TAVERNA and G OLDSTEIN 2002b; X IA and L EVITT 2004)).\nSimulations with simplified lattice models of proteins have attempted to provide insight into\nthe specific features of protein neutral networks. These simulations have shown that lattice\nprotein neutral networks are centered around highly connected nodes occupied by stable proteins (B ORNBERG -BAUER and C HAN 1999; X IA and L EVITT 2004; W INGREEN et al. 2004;\nB ROGLIA et al. 1999), a finding consistent with the experimental observation (B LOOM et al. 2005;\n\n6\n\n\fB LOOM et al. 2006) that stable proteins are more mutationally robust. Lattice protein studies also suggest that protein structures differ in their \"designabilities\" (defined as the total\nnumber of sequences that fold into a structure), and that sequences that fold into more designable structures will neutrally evolve at a faster rate due to the increased size and connectivity of their neutral networks (G OVINDARAJAN and G OLDSTEIN 1997; L I et al. 1996;\nE NGLAND and S HAKHNOVICH 2003; C HAN and B ORNBERG -BAUER 2002; W INGREEN et al. 2004).\nFinally, simulations have demonstrated that fluctuations in neutrality as a protein population\nmoves along its neutral network can lead to an overdispersion of the molecular clock (BASTOLLA et al. 2002),\nas originally suggested by Takahata. However, an extension of these lattice protein simulations\nof evolution on neutral networks into a quantitative theory has been difficult because protein\nneutral networks are far too large to be computed for all but the simplest lattice models.\nHere we present a mathematical treatment of neutral protein evolution that describes the\nevolutionary dynamics in terms of the \u2206\u2206G values for single mutations, which are experimentally measurable. Our treatment is based on the experimentally verified (B LOOM et al. 2005;\nB LOOM et al. 2006) connection between protein stability and mutational robustness, as well\nas a few biophysically supported assumptions about \u2206\u2206G values for random mutations. By\nlinking a protein's tolerance to mutations with stability, we are able to quantitatively describe\nneutral evolution without a full description of the neutral network. We can then compute the\naverage number of accumulated mutations, the average fraction of neutral mutations, the index\nof dispersion, and the distribution of stabilities in a neutrally evolving population solely from\nknowledge of the \u2206\u2206G values for single mutations. In addition, we follow the formalism of\n\n7\n\n\fVAN\n\nN IMWEGEN et al. (1999) to calculate all four of these properties in the limit when the\n\nproduct of the population size and mutation rate is much less than one and in the limit when\nthis product is much greater than one. In demonstrating that these properties are different in\nthese two limits, we show that the rate of fixation of neutral mutations can vary with population\nsize in violation of one of the standard predictions of Kimura's neutral theory (K IMURA 1987).\nOur work presents a unified view of neutral protein evolution that is grounded in measureable\nthermodynamic quantities.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nLattice Protein Simulations We performed simulations with lattice proteins of L = 20\nmonomers of 20 types corresponding to the natural amino acids. The proteins could occupy\nany of the 41,889,578 possible compact or non-compact conformations on a two-dimensional\nlattice. The energy of a conformation C is the sum of the nonbonded nearest-neighbor interactions, E (C) =\n\nL i\u22122\nP\nP\n\nCij (C) \u00d7 \u01eb (Ai , Aj ), where Cij (C) is one if residues i and j are nearest\n\ni=1 j=1\n\nneighbors in conformation C and zero otherwise, and \u01eb (Ai , Aj ) is the interaction energy between residue types Ai and Aj , given by Table 5 of M IYAZAWA and J ERNIGAN (1985). We\ncomputed the stability of a conformation Ct as \u2206Gf (Ct ) = E (Ct )+T ln {Q (T ) \u2212 exp [\u2212E (Ct ) /T ]} ,\nwhere Q (T ) =\n\nP\n\nexp [\u2212E (C i ) /T ] is the partition sum, made tractable by noting that there\n\n{C i }\nare only 910,972 unique contact sets. All simulations were performed at a reduced temperature\nof T = 1.0\nWe used adaptive walks to find sequences that folded into each of the three arbitrarily chosen conformations shown in Fig. 2 with \u2206Gf \u2264 0, and then neutrally evolved these sequences\n8\n\n\ffor 104 generations with a population size of N = 100. Our evolutionary algorithm was as\nfollows: at each generation we randomly chose a protein that folded to the parental structure\nwith \u2206Gf \u2264 0 from the population and mutated each residue to some other randomly chosen\nresidue with probability 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 , and continued doing this until we had filled the new population with proteins. At the end of this equilibration evolution, we chose the most abundant\nsequence in the population as the starting point for further analysis and for the computation\nof the distribution of \u2206\u2206G values for all 380 point mutations (sequences shown in Fig. 2).\nIn principle, computing the distribution of \u2206\u2206G values over all sequences in the population\nrather than just the most abundant one should give a more accurate representation of the true\nform of this distribution, and indeed we found that doing this slightly increased the accuracy\nof the predictions shown in Fig. 2. However, the resulting improvement in accuracy was small,\nsince the approximate constancy of the \u2206\u2206G distribution during neutral evolution (discussed\nbelow) means that the distribution computed over a single sequence is representative of that\ncomputed over all sequences in the population. Therefore, we chose to compute the \u2206\u2206G\ndistribution over just the most abundant sequence since this choice more closely tracks what\nwould be experimentally feasible with real proteins. (It is experimentally tractable to compute\n\u2206\u2206G values for a single protein, but would be unmanageable to do so for all proteins in a\nnatural population.)\nTo collect data for the case when the product N \u03bc of the population size N and the per\nprotein per generation mutation rate \u03bc is \u226a 1, we first equilibrated 1,000 replicates by evolving each of them with a population size of N = 10 and for 5,000 generations starting with\n\n9\n\n\fa clonal population of the initial sequence described above. The remainder of the evolutionary algorithm was as described above: the mutation rate stayed at 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 per residue per\ngeneration (corresponding to a per protein per generation mutation rate of \u03bc = 10\u22122 ), and at\neach generation all proteins that folded to the target native structure with \u2206Gf \u2264 0 reproduced\nwith equal probability. We then evolved each of these equilibrated populations for a further\n5,000 generations to collect data. We combined the data for all the folded proteins in the final populations of all the replicates to calculate the average number of mutations hmiT after T\ngenerations, the corresponding index of dispersion RT , and the distribution of stabilities shown\nin Fig. 2. If we instead simply randomly chose a single folded protein from the final population of each replicate, we obtained results that were identical within the precision shown in\nFig. 2. We emphasize that hmiT and RT were computed by keeping track of the actual number\nof mutations that had occurred during the evolutionary history of each protein, not simply by\ncounting the number of amino acid differences between the ancestral and final sequences (the\ntwo quantities may differ if a single site undergoes multiple mutations, as discussed in more\ndetail in later sections).\nTo generate the data for N \u03bc \u226b 1, we used the same procedure but with N = 105 and only\nperformed 10 replicates. We again computed the statistics shown in Fig. 2 by combining the\ndata for all of the folded proteins in the final populations of all 10 replicates. Similar results\nwere obtained if we instead computed hmiT and RT over all of the folded proteins in the final\npopulation of a single replicate (average values of hmiT were identical while the RT values of\n1.03, 0.95, and 0.94 were extremely similar to those shown from top to bottom in Fig. 2). This\n\n10\n\n\foutcome is expected since the probability distributions for N\u03bc \u226b 1 evolve deterministically.\n\nLattice Protein Predictions The numerical predictions for the lattice proteins given in Fig. 2\nwere computed by constructing the matrix W described in the first section of RESULTS with\na bin size of b = 0.005 and truncating the matrix by assuming that no proteins would have\nstabilities less than -5.0. For the case when N \u03bc \u226a 1, hmiT was calculated using Equation 6\nand RT was calculated using Equation 11. For N \u03bc \u226b 1, hmiT was calculated using Equation\n18 and RT was calculated using Equation 19.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAssumptions and Mathematical Background In this section we describe the physical view\nof protein evolution that motivates our work. We begin with the basic observations that evolution selects for protein function, and that most proteins must stably fold in order to function (A NFINSEN 1973), meaning that protein stability is under evolutionary pressure only insofar as it must be sufficient to allow a protein to fold and function. In taking this view,\nwe ignore those proteins (estimated at 10% of prokaryotic and 30% of eukaryotic proteins)\nthat are intrinsically disordered (U VERSKY et al. 2005), as well as those rare proteins that are\nonly kinetically stable (JASWAL et al. 2002). Natural selection for function requires a protein to fold with some minimal stability \u2206Gmin\nf , since proteins that lack this minimal stability will be unable to reliably adopt their native structure and perform their biochemical\n=\ntask. A protein's extra stability beyond this minimal threshold is quantified as \u2206Gextra\nf\nextra\n\u2264 0 (more negative val\u2206Gf \u2212\u2206Gmin\nf , meaning that all functional proteins must have \u2206Gf\n\n11\n\n\fues of \u2206Gf indicate increased stability). We further assume that as long as \u2206Gextra\n\u2264 0, natf\nural selection for protein function is indifferent to the exact amount of extra stability a protein\nposesses. This assumption is at odds with the persistent speculation that high stability inherently impairs protein function and so is selected against by evolution (D E P RISTO et al. 2005;\nS OMERO 1995). But the circular argument most commonly advanced to support this speculation - that the observed marginal stability of natural proteins indicates that higher stability is\ndetrimental to protein function - has now been contradicted both by experiments that have\ndramatically increased protein stability without sacrificing function (S ERRANO et al. 1993;\nG IVER et al. 1998;\n\nVAN DEN\n\nBURG et al. 1998; Z HAO and A RNOLD 1999) and by demon-\n\nstrations that marginal stability is a simple consequence of the fact that most mutations are\ndestabilizing (TAVERNA and G OLDSTEIN 2002a; A RNOLD et al. 2001, as well as the current\nwork). There is a possibility, however, that certain regulatory proteins must be marginally\nstable to faciliate rapid degradation (H UNTZICKER et al. 2006). To summarize, current biochemical evidence supports our assumption that (with certain well-defined exceptions) the only\nrequirement imposed on protein stability by natural selection for protein function is that stability must meet or surpass some minimal threshold (a protein must have \u2206Gextra\n\u2264 0).\nf\nA mutation to a protein changes its stability by an amount \u2206\u2206G, and experimental measurements of \u2206\u2206G values have shown that most mutations are destabilizing (have \u2206\u2206G >\n0) (PAKULA et al. 1986; G ODOY-RUIZ et al. 2004; M ATTHEWS 1993; K UMAR et al. 2006).\n\u2264 0 since\nA mutation is neutral with respect to selection for stability if \u2206\u2206G + \u2206Gextra\nf\nthe mutant protein still satisfies the minimal stability threshold; otherwise the mutant does\n\n12\n\n\fnot stably fold and is culled by natural selection. Of course, mutations can also have specific effects on protein function (such as altering an enzyme's activity), but experiments have\nshown that such mutations are rare compared to the large number of mutations that affect stability (S HORTLE and L IN 1985; PAKULA et al. 1986; L OEB et al. 1989; B LOOM et al. 2006).\nMutations can also have effects unrelated to the functioning of the individual protein molecule:\nthey can affect its propensity to aggregate (C HITI et al. 2000), alter its codon usage (A KASHI 2003),\nchange its mRNA stability (C HAMARY and H URST 2005), affect the efficiency or accuracy\nof translation (A KASHI 2003; ROCHA and DANCHIN 2004), or change the fraction of mistranslated proteins that fold (D RUMMOND et al. 2005). These higher-level effects are probably most apparent in the evolution of highly expressed proteins (D RUMMOND et al. 2005;\nPAL et al. 2001). However, here we ignore such effects and assume that the evolutionary impact of a mutation is mostly determined by its effect on protein stability (an assumption in\nagreement with a recent bioinformatics analysis by S ANCHEZ et al. (2006)). The view we\npresent therefore describes the impact of a mutation solely by its \u2206\u2206G value and the \u2206Gextra\nof\nf\nthe wildtype protein, and is summarized graphically in Fig. 1 We have previously used a similar\nview to successfully describe experimental protein mutagenesis results (B LOOM et al. 2005;\nB LOOM et al. 2006).\n[Figure 1 about here.]\nTo use the view of Fig. 1 to construct a useful description of neutral protein evolution,\nwe make one major assumption: that the overall distribution of \u2206\u2206G values for random mutations stays roughly constant as the protein sequence evolves. Actually, this assumption is\n13\n\n\fstronger than is strictly needed for the mathematical theory presented below - the theory can\nbe developed simply by assuming that all proteins with the same \u2206Gf have the same distribution of \u2206\u2206G values (in this case the matrix elements Wij introduced below depend on\nj in addition to the difference i \u2212 j). However, we make the stronger assumption that the\n\u2206\u2206G distribution remains constant during sequence evolution, since we believe that this assumption is consistent with existing evidence. We emphasize that this assumption does not\nimply that we are arguing that the \u2206\u2206G distribution is identical for every possible protein\nsequence. Clearly, for any given structure there is a most stable sequence (with all \u2206\u2206G\nvalues positive), a least stable sequence (with all \u2206\u2206G values negative), and a vast range of\nsequences in between. However, most of these sequences fall within a stability range that\nis never populated by evolution, since simulations (TAVERNA and G OLDSTEIN 2002a) and\nexperiments (K EEFE and S ZOSTAK 2001; DAVIDSON et al. 1995) clearly show that the vast\nmajority of protein sequences do not stably fold into any structure (meaning the least stable\nfolded protein is still far more stable than the typical random sequence). Among the subset of sequences that do stably fold, the simple statistical reality that marginally stable sequences are far more abundant than highly stable sequences causes evolution to further confine itself mostly to sequences with stabilities far less than that of the most stable sequence\n(TAVERNA and G OLDSTEIN 2002a; A RNOLD et al. 2001, as well as the current work). This\nfact is amply demonstrated by engineering experiments that have greatly increased the stability\nof natural proteins without sacrificing any of their functional properties (S ERRANO et al. 1993;\nG IVER et al. 1998;\n\nVAN DEN\n\nBURG et al. 1998; Z HAO and A RNOLD 1999). Therefore, al-\n\n14\n\n\fthough the distribution of \u2206\u2206G values certainly varies widely among all sequences, it is still\nreasonable to assume that it is relatively constant among those sequences visited by natural evolution. This assumption of a constant \u2206\u2206G distribution among evolved sequences is explicitly supported by simulations (B LOOM et al. 2005; B LOOM et al. 2006; B ROGLIA et al. 1999;\nW ILKE et al. 2005, as well as the current work), and is consistent with the observation that the\nnumber of neighbors on a protein's neutral network is approximately determined by its stability (B ORNBERG -BAUER and C HAN 1999; X IA and L EVITT 2004). Furthermore, protein\nmutagenesis experiments indicate that the \u2206\u2206G values for random mutations are usually additive (S ERRANO et al. 1993; W ELLS 1990), meaning that any given mutation to a protein of\nlength L will alter only \u2248 1/L of the other \u2206\u2206G values, leaving the \u2206\u2206G distribution mostly\nunchanged. Finally, the assumption of a constant \u2206\u2206G distribution has been shown to explain the experimentally observed exponential decline in the fraction of functional proteins\nwith increasing numbers of mutations (B LOOM et al. 2005). However, we acknowledge that\nat present the assumption of a roughly constant \u2206\u2206G distribution among neutrally evolving\nproteins can be verified only for lattice proteins - for real proteins the most we can say is that\nit is consistent with existing experimental evidence.\nWe begin our mathematical treatment by conceptually dividing the continuous variable of\nprotein stability into small discrete bins of width b. This discretization of stability allows us to\ntreat mutations as moving a protein from one bin to another - the bins can be made arbitrarily\nsmall to eliminate any numerical effects of the binning. The stability of each folded protein in\nthe evolving population (the folded proteins are all those with \u2206Gextra\n\u2264 0) can be described\nf\n\n15\n\n\fby specifying its stability bin. Specifically, a protein is in bin i if it has \u2206Gextra\nbetween\nf\n(1 \u2212 i) b and \u2212ib, where i = 1, 2, . . .. Let Wij be the probability that a random mutation has\na \u2206\u2206G value such that it moves a protein's stability from bin j to bin i, where i and j both\nare in the range 1, 2, . . .. Then Wij is easily computed as the fraction of \u2206\u2206G values between\nb (j \u2212 i \u2212 1) and b (j \u2212 i). Since Wij only describes transitions between folded proteins, and\nsince we have assumed that a protein's mutational tolerance is determined by its stability, then\nthe fraction of folded mutants (neutrality) of a protein in bin j is \u03bdj =\n\nP\n\nWij . Clearly, more\n\ni\n\nstable proteins will have larger values of \u03bdj .\n\nIn the next two sections, we will use the matrix W with elements Wij to calculate the\ndistribution of stabilities in an evolving protein population of constant size N, the mean number of mutations hmiT after T generations, the corresponding index of dispersion RT =\n2\n\nhm2 iT \u2212hmiT\n, and the average fraction of mutations h\u03bdi that do not destabilize the proteins\nhmiT\npast the minimal stability threshold. We assume that W is computed from the distribution of\n\u2206\u2206G values for all random single amino-acid mutations, although in principle it could be for\nany type of mutation. We also assume that the per-protein-per-generation mutation rate \u03bc is\nsmall, so that at each generation a protein undergoes at most one mutation. Our calculations\nat first follow, and then extend the theoretical treatment by\n\nVAN\n\nN IMWEGEN et al. (1999) of\n\nevolution on a neutral network. In particular, we follow their lead in separately treating the\ntwo limiting cases where the product N\u03bc of the population size and mutation rate is \u226a 1 and\n\u226b 1. We emphasize that all of the equations derived in the next two sections depend only on\nthe mutation rate \u03bc, the number of generations T , and the matrix W which can be computed\n\n16\n\n\ffrom the single-mutant \u2206\u2206G values. The population size N determines the applicable limiting\ncase, but otherwise drops out of all final results.\n\nLimit when N\u03bc \u226a 1 When N \u03bc \u226a 1, the evolving population is usually clonal, since each\nmutation is either lost or goes to fixation before the next mutation occurs. If a mutation destabilizes a protein in the population beyond the stability cutoff, then it is immediately culled\nby natural selection. If a mutation does not destabilize a protein beyond the stability cutoff, it will be lost to genetic drift with probability\n\nN \u22121\nN\n\nand go to fixation with probability\n\n1/N (K IMURA 1983). Since mutations occur rarely (N \u03bc \u226a 1), the loss or fixation of the\nmutant will occur before the next mutant appears in the population. The entire population\ntherefore moves as one entity along its neutral network. The population can thus be described\nby the column vector p (t), with element pi (t) giving the probability that the population is in\nstability bin i at time t.\nIf the population is initially in stability bin j, at each generation there is a probability\nN \u03bcWij that a protein experiences a mutation that changes its stability to bin i, and if such a\nmutation occurs, then there is a probability of 1/N that it is eventually fixed in the population.\nTherefore, at each generation there is a probability \u03bcWij that the population experiences a\nmutation that eventually causes it to move from stability bin j to bin i. If we define the matrix\nV so that the diagonal elements are given by Vii = \u03bdi and all other elements are zero, then p\nevolves according to\np (t + 1) = (I \u2212 \u03bcV + \u03bcW) p (t)\n\n17\n\n(1)\n\n\fwhere I is the identity matrix. Note that this equation treats lethal mutations (those that destabilize a protein beyond the cutoff) as immediately being lost to natural selection and so leaving\nthe population in its original stability bin (hence the population accumulates a mutation with\nprobability \u03bcV rather than probability \u03bc). Equation 1 describes a Markov process with the nonnegative, irreducible, and acyclic transition matrix A = I \u2212 \u03bcV + \u03bcW, and so p approaches\nthe unique stationary distribution po satisfying\n0 = (V \u2212 W) po .\n\n(2)\n\nThis equation gives the expected distribution of protein stabilities solely in terms of the singlemutant \u2206\u2206G values.\nWe now calculate the average number of mutations hmiT,o that accumulate in an equilibrated population after T generations and the corresponding index of dispersion RT,o . We emphasize that hmiT,o represents the average number of accumulated mutations during the course\nof the evolutionary process. When the number of accumulated mutations m is small compared\nto the length of the protein sequence L (m \u226a L), then m is just equal to the number of residues\ndiffering from those in the parent protein sequence (the Hamming distance). However, when\nm becomes substantial relative to L, m becomes larger than the Hamming distance since some\nsites will undergo multiple mutations (J UKES and C ANTOR 1969). In this case it is necessary\nto use a substitution model to infer m from the observed Hamming distance. In the treatment\nthat follows, we calculate the expected value of m; application of these formulae to actual protein sequences requires use of one of the well-established statistical techniques for inferring\nm from the Hamming distance (J UKES and C ANTOR 1969; G OLDMAN and YANG 1994). We\n18\n\n\fbegin the calculation of hmiT,o by defining p (m, t) to be the column vector with element i giving the probability that at time t the population has accumulated m mutations and is in stability\nbin i. The time evolution of p (m, t)is given by\np (m, t + 1) = (I \u2212 \u03bcV) p (m, t) + \u03bcWp (m \u2212 1, t).\n\n(3)\n\nThe kth moment of the number of mutations at time t is\nhmk it = e\n\nX\n\nmk p (m, t),\n\n(4)\n\nm\n\nwhere e = (1, . . . , 1) is the unit row vector. We can write a recursive equation for hmit in the\nlong-time limit (steady state) by multiplying both sides of Equation 3 by m, summing over m,\nand left multiplying by e to obtain\nhmit+1 = e (I \u2212 \u03bcV)\n\nX\n\nmp (m, t) + \u03bceW\n\nm\n\n= eA\n\nX\n\nX\n\nmp (m \u2212 1, t)\n\nm\n\nmp (m, t) + \u03bceWpo\n\nm\n\n= hmit + \u03bch\u03bdio,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere we have used the property eA = e, noted that in the long-time limit\n\nP\n\np (m, t) = po\n\nm\n\nand\n\nP\nm\n\nmp (m \u2212 1, t) =\n\nP\n\n[(m \u2212 1) p (m \u2212 1, t) + p (m \u2212 1, t)] =\n\nm\n\nP\n\nmp (m, t) + po , and\n\nm\n\ndefined the average neutrality as h\u03bdio = eWpo = eVpo .

In a fashion analogous to the construction of Equation 5, we can write a\n19\n\n\frecursive expression for the long-time limit of hm2 iT,o as\nhm2 it+1 = e (I \u2212 \u03bcV)\n\nX\n\nm2 p (m, t) + \u03bceW\n\nm\n\n= eA\n\nX\n\n2\n\nm2 p (m \u2212 1, t)\n\nm\n\nm p (m, t) + 2\u03bceW\n\nm\n\nX\n\nmp (m, t) + \u03bceWpo\n\nm\n\n\"\n\n= hm2 it + 2\u03bceW A\n2\n\n2\n\nX\n\n= hm it + 2\u03bc eW\n\nX\n\n#\n\nmp (m, t \u2212 1) + \u03bcWpo + \u03bch\u03bdio\n\nm\n\nt\u22121\nX\n\nA\u03c4 Wpo + \u03bch\u03bdio\n\n(7)\n\n\u03c4 =0\n\nwhere we have used the property (implicit in Equation 5) that in the long-time limit,\n\nP\n\nmp (m, t) =\n\nm\n\nA\n\nP\n\nmp (m, t \u2212 1) + \u03bcWpo .

Let\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbK be the eigenvalues of V\u2212W, and let r1 , . . . , rK and l1 , . . . , lK be the corresponding\nright and left eigenvectors, normalized so that li rj = 1 if i = j and 0 otherwise. These eigenvectors are also eigenvectors of the irreducible, acyclic, stochastic A, and the corresponding\neigenvalues are 1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bb1 , . . . , 1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbK , with Perron-Frobenius theorems guaranteeing that one\neigenvalue (chosen here to be 1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bb1 ) is equal to one and all other eigenvalues have absolute\nvalues less than one. Then r1 and l1 are right and left eigenvectors of Q with eigenvalue 1 (i.e.\nr1 = po and l1 = e), and all other eigenvalues of Q are zero. The spectral decompositions are\ntherefore Q = r1 l1 and A = r1 l1 +\n\nK\nP\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi ) ri li . Inserting these spectral decompositions\n\ni=2\n\ninto Equation 9, we find for the index of dispersion a value of\nRT,o\n\n\u0013 K\nT \u0012\nX\n2\u03bc\nt X\n= 1 \u2212 \u03bch\u03bdio +\neW\n1\u2212\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )t\u22121 ri li Wpo ,\nh\u03bdio\nT\nt=1\ni=2\n\nsince At = r1 l1 +\n\nK\nP\n\n(10)\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )t ri li (E WENS and G RANT 2005). In the limit of large T and\n\ni=2\n\nsmall \u03bc, the value of RT,o given by the above equation approaches the value\nT\n\nRT,o\n\nK\n\nXX\n2\u03bc\neW\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )t\u22121 ri li Wpo\n\u2248 1+\nh\u03bdio\nt=1 i=2\nK\n\n\u2248 1+\n\nX\n2\n\u03bb\u22121\neW\ni ri li Wpo ,\nh\u03bdio\ni=2\n\nwhere the \u03bch\u03bdio term drops out because \u03bc is small and the\n\nT\nP\n\nt=1\n\n(11)\n\nt\nT\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi )t\u22121 term drops out\n\nbecause T is large and |1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03bbi | < 1. This equation shows that RT,o approaches a constant\n\n21\n\n\fvalue independent of T and \u03bc. Although we could not prove that value of RT,o given by Equation 11 is necessarily greater than one (since some of the eigenvalues \u03bbi could be complex), in\nall of our simulations we observed RT,o > 1, suggesting that when N\u03bc \u226a 1, fluctuations in\nprotein stability tend to overdisperse the molecular clock.\n\nLimit when N \u03bc \u226b 1 When N \u03bc \u226b 1, the population is spread across many nodes of the\nneutral network rather than converged on a single sequence (VAN N IMWEGEN et al. 1999).\nIn this limit, we treat the evolutionary dynamics of the population deterministically (i.e., we\nassume an infinite population size), and describe the distribution of stabilities in the population\nby the column vector x (t), with element xi (t) giving the fraction of proteins in the population\nat time t that have stabilities in bin i. At generation t, the fraction of mutated proteins that\ncontinue to fold is h\u03bdit = eWx (t). These folded proteins reproduce, and in order to maintain\na constant population size, this reproduction must balance the removal of proteins by death,\nmeaning that each folded sequence must produce an average of \u03b1t = [1 \u2212 \u03bc (1 \u2212 h\u03bdit )]\u22121\noffspring. The population therefore evolves according to\nx (t + 1) = \u03b1t [(1 \u2212 \u03bc) I + \u03bcW] x (t) .\n\n(12)\n\nAfter the population has evolved for a sufficient period of time, x approaches an equilibrium\ndistribution of x\u221e . The corresponding equilibrium neutrality is h\u03bdi\u221e = eWx\u221e , and the\nequilibrium reproduction rate is \u03b1 = [1 \u2212 \u03bc (1 \u2212 h\u03bdi\u221e )]\u22121 , so\nx\u221e = \u03b1 [(1 \u2212 \u03bc) I + \u03bcW] x\u221e .\n\n22\n\n(13)\n\n\fThis equation can be rewritten to show that x\u221e is the principal eigenvector of W,\nh\u03bdi\u221e x\u221e = Wx\u221e .\n\n(14)\n\nWe note that h\u03bdi\u221e approximates the asymptotic neutrality for the decline in the fraction of\nfolded proteins upon random mutagenesis (B LOOM et al. 2005; W ILKE et al. 2005).\nWe now determine the average number of accumulated mutations hmiT,\u221e and the corresponding index of dispersion RT,\u221e by treating the forward evolutionary process. As described\nin the text immediately prior to Equation 3, our calculations describe the actual number of\nmutations accumulated during the evolutionary process, which may differ from the number\nof sequence differences relative to the ancestor if a single site undergoes multiple mutations.\nWhen N \u03bc \u226b 1, it is not a priori obvious that the average number of mutations present in the\npopulation is equivalent to number of fixed substitutions along the line of descent. Therefore,\nin the APPENDIX, we show that identical results are obtained by tracing a randomly chosen\nprotein backwards in time along its ancestor distribution, proving the treatment we give below\nis mathematically equivalent to treating the time-reversed process. We define x (m, t) as the\ncolumn vector with element i giving the fraction of the population at time t that has accumulated m mutations and is in stability bin i. Once the population has reached the equilibrium\ndistribution of stabilities, the time evolution of x (m, t) is\nx (m, t + 1) = \u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03bc) x (m, t) + \u03b1\u03bcWx (m \u2212 1, t).\n\n(15)\n\nThe recursion can be solved to obtain\nx (m, t) = \u03b1\n\nt\n\nt \u0012 \u0013\nX\nt\n\u03ba=0\n\n\u03ba\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bc)t\u2212\u03ba \u03bc\u03ba W\u03ba x (m \u2212 \u03ba, 0) ,\n\n23\n\n(16)\n\n\fas can be verified by direct substitution. Since we are assuming the population has equilibrated\nat time 0 and no mutations have accumulated at that time, x (m, 0) is x\u221e for m = 0 and 0\notherwise. Furthermore, x\u221e satisfies Equation 14, so multiplying Equation 16 by e yields\n\u0012 \u0013\nt\n\u03b1t (1 \u2212 \u03bc)t\u2212m (\u03bch\u03bdi\u221e )m ,\nx (m, t) =\nm\n\n(17)\n\nwhere x (m, t) = ex (m, t) gives the fraction of the population that has accumulated m mutations after t generations. The average number of accumulated mutations after T generations is\nthe mean of this binomial distribution,\nhmiT,\u221e =\n\nT \u03bch\u03bdi\u221e\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03bc (1 \u2212 h\u03bdi\u221e )\n\n(18)\n\nUsing the well known result for the variance of the binomial distribution, we find that the index\nof dispersion is\nRT,\u221e = 1 \u2212\n\n\u03bch\u03bdi\u221e\n.\n1 \u2212 \u03bc (1 \u2212 h\u03bdi\u221e )\n\n(19)\n\nIt is important to reiterate that the above equation was derived under the assumption that there\nis at most one mutation per sequence per generation. For realistic distributions of mutations\n(i.e. Poisson), this means that \u03bc \u226a 1. In this regime, RT,\u221e is close to one.\n\nLattice Protein Simulations We tested our theory's predictions on the evolutionary dynamics\nof lattice proteins. Lattice proteins are simple protein models that are useful tools for studying protein folding and evolution (C HAN and B ORNBERG -BAUER 2002). Our lattice proteins\nwere chains of 20 amino acids that folded on a two-dimensional lattice. The energy of a lattice\nprotein conformation was equal to the sum of the pairwise interactions between non-bonded\n24\n\n\famino acids (M IYAZAWA and J ERNIGAN 1985). Each lattice protein has 41,889,578 possible\nconformations, and by summing over all of these conformations we could exactly determine\nthe partition sum and calculate \u2206Gf . We set a minimal stability threshold for the lattice proteins of \u2206Gmin\n= 0, meaning that we considered all proteins that folded to the target structure\nf\nwith \u2206Gf \u2264 0 to be folded and functional, while all proteins with \u2206Gf > 0 were considered\nto be nonfunctional. We note that this stability threshold is equivalent to requiring a lattice\nprotein to spend at least half of its time in the target native structure at equilibrium. We began\nby generating lattice proteins that stably folded to each of the three different structures shown\nin Figure 2. For each of these three proteins, we determined the distribution of \u2206\u2206G values\nfor all 380 single mutations (these distributions are shown in Figure 2). These distributions\nwere used to construct the matrix W and to predict the equilibrium distribution of stabilities,\nthe average number of mutations, and the indices of dispersion for both the N \u03bc \u226a 1 and the\nN \u03bc \u226b 1 cases, using the equations presented in the preceding sections.\nTo test the accuracy of these predictions, we then simulated evolving populations of the\nlattice proteins with a standard evolutionary algorithm using Wright-Fisher sampling. Briefly,\nthe populations were held at a constant size of either N = 10 or N = 105 . At each generation, a\nnew population was created by choosing parents with equal probability from all folded proteins\nin the previous generation's population, and copying these parents into the new population\nwith a mutation rate of 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 mutations per residue per generation. Since the proteins\nhave a length of 20 amino acids, this mutation rate corresponds to a per-protein-per-generation\nmutation rate of \u03bc = 10\u22122 . Therefore, the product N \u03bc is either 0.1 or 103 , corresponding\n\n25\n\n\fto N \u03bc \u226a 1 or N \u03bc \u226b 1, respectively. We emphasize that the lattice protein evolutionary\nalgorithm is the same for both population sizes. When N = 10 the population naturally follows\ndynamics approximating those presented for N\u03bc \u226a 1, while when N = 105 it naturally\nfollows dynamics approximating those presented for N\u03bc \u226b 1 (as evidenced by the excellent\nagreement of the predictions with the simulations). For N = 10, we performed 1,000 replicates\nfor each different structure. For N = 105 , computational constraints limited us to 10 replicates\nfor each structure (however the evolutionary dynamics are nearly deterministic in this case,\nso all replicates yielded similar results). We note that during the simulations we recorded the\nnumber of mutations that actually accumulated rather than simply computing the number of\ndifferences (Hamming distance) from the original sequence.\nFigure 2 shows the theoretical predictions and simulation results for each of the three structures. The theoretical predictions are in good agreement with the simulation results. Figure 2\nclearly shows that when N \u03bc \u226b 1, the proteins tend to be more stable than when N \u03bc \u226a 1.\nThis extra stability is a biophysical manifestation of the neutrally evolved mutational robustness predicted by VAN N IMWEGEN et al. (1999). This increase in stability leads to a substantial increase number of accumulated mutations. In accordance with the theoretical predictions,\nwhen N \u03bc \u226a 1 the index of dispersion is elevated above one by fluctuations in protein stability.\nAnother clear results from the simulations is that proteins of different structure show markedly\ndifferent distributions of stabilities and rates of sequence evolution due to the differences in\ntheir \u2206\u2206G distributions. Overall, the simulations offer strong support for the validity of the\ntheoretical predictions in the preceding sections.\n\n26\n\n\f[Figure 2 about here.]\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have presented that a theory that offers quantitative predictions about the distribution of\nstabilities, the average number of fixed mutations, and the index of dispersion for an evolving\nprotein population in terms of the \u2206\u2206G values for individual mutations. We have demonstrated that these predictions are accurate for simple lattice proteins, and have used existing\nbiophysical evidence to argue that the basic theoretical assumptions should also be accurate for\nreal proteins. In this section, we give qualitative interpretations of the mathematical results and\ndiscuss their implications for our understanding of protein evolution.\nOne major result is to show that the effects of protein structure on the rate of sequence\nevolution can be quantitatively cast in terms of the \u2206\u2206G values for single mutations. Numerous lattice protein simulations have shown that protein structure can dramatically affect\nthe rate of sequence evolution, since structures that are more \"designable\" (encoded by more\nsequences) can evolve their sequences more rapidly (as can be seen in Fig. 2 of this work)\n(G OVINDARAJAN and G OLDSTEIN 1997; B ORNBERG -BAUER and C HAN 1999; T IANA et al. 2000;\nX IA and L EVITT 2004; L I et al. 1996; C HAN and B ORNBERG -BAUER 2002; W INGREEN et al. 2004).\nUnfortunately, these simulations typically measure structural designability by enumerating a\nlarge number of lattice protein sequences, meaning that their findings cannot be extended to\nreal proteins for which such extensive enumeration is impossible. However, recent theoretical\nwork by E NGLAND and S HAKHNOVICH (2003) has made progress in connecting designability to observable structural properties, and a bioinformatics analysis based on this theoretical\n\n27\n\n\fmeasure of designability indicates that structure indeed influences the evolutionary rate of real\nproteins (B LOOM et al. 2006b). Our work provides a way to quantitatively relate the structural influences on protein evolution to experimentally measureable \u2206\u2206G values, opening the\ndoor to further connecting structural designability and sequence evolution to laboratory stability measurements. Although thousands of \u2206\u2206G values have been measured experimentally\n(K UMAR et al. 2006), at present there are no large sets of measurements for truly random mutations to a single protein. When such sets of measurements become available, it should be\npossible to use them in conjunction with the theory that we have presented to predict the neutralities of real proteins with different structures.\nA second important result is to show that protein evolutionary dynamics can depend on the\nproduct of population size and mutation rate, N\u03bc. When N\u03bc \u226b 1, the evolving protein population is polymorphic in stability and subject to frequent mutations, so the more stable (and\nthus more mutationally tolerant) proteins produce more folded offspring. In contrast, when\nN \u03bc \u226a 1, the population is usually monomorphic in stability and so all members of the population are equally likely to produce folded offspring. The general tendency for populations to\nneutrally evolve mutational robustness when N \u03bc \u226b 1 has previously been treated mathematically by VAN N IMWEGEN et al. (1999), and a variety of lattice protein simulations have noted\nthe tendency of evolving protein populations to preferentially occupy highly connected neutral network nodes (B ORNBERG -BAUER and C HAN 1999; TAVERNA and G OLDSTEIN 2002b;\nX IA and L EVITT 2004). Our work shows that for proteins, in the limiting cases when N \u03bc \u226a 1\nor \u226b 1, this process can be rigorously described by considering only protein stability, rather\n\n28\n\n\fthan requiring a full analysis of the neutral network (provided, as we have argued is likely to be\nthe case, that the assumption of a roughly constant \u2206\u2206G distribution holds for real proteins as\nwell as it holds for our lattice proteins). In addition, we prove that the number of accumulated\nmutations depends on whether N\u03bc is \u226a 1 or \u226b 1. This finding is at odds with the standard\nprediction (K IMURA 1987) of Kimura's neutral theory that the rate of evolution is independent\nof population size. The reason for this discrepancy is that the standard neutral theory fails to account for the possibility that increasing the population size so that N \u03bc \u226b 1 can systematically\nincrease the fraction of mutations that are neutral.\nA third important contribution of our theory is to use the distribution of \u2206\u2206G values for single mutations to predict the distribution of protein stabilities in an evolving population. Several\nresearchers have pointed out that evolved proteins will be marginally stable simply because\nmost mutations are destabilizing (TAVERNA and G OLDSTEIN 2002a; A RNOLD et al. 2001);\nwe have described this process quantitatively. In addition, we have shown how the neutral\nevolution of mutational robustness when N\u03bc \u226b 1 will shift the proteins towards higher stabilities (as shown in Fig. 2), although this increase in stability is limited by the counterbalancing\npressure of predominantly destabilizing mutations. The formulae we provide can in principle be combined with experimentally measured \u2206\u2206G values to predict the expected range of\nstabilities for evolved proteins.\nOur work also weds Takahata's concept that fluctuating neutral spaces might overdisperse\nthe molecular clock (TAKAHATA 1987; C UTLER 2000b; BASTOLLA et al. 2002) to a concrete\ndiscription of how protein neutrality fluctuates during evolution. When N \u03bc \u226a 1, fluctuations\n\n29\n\n\fin protein stability can cause an overdispersion in the number of accumulated substitutions\nthat can be calculated from the single-mutant \u2206\u2206G distribution. Furthermore, given our assumption of a roughly constant \u2206\u2206G distribution, we show that the index of dispersion will approach a constant value that is independent of time or mutation rate, but will depend on whether\nN \u03bc \u226a 1 or \u226b 1. Previous simulations have indicated that overdispersion indeed depends on\nthe population size (BASTOLLA et al. 2002; W ILKE 2004) - we have explained this dependence by showing that stability-induced overdispersion does not occur when N \u03bc \u226b 1 since\nthe population's distribution of stabilities equilibrates as it spreads across many sequences.\nMathematically, the difference in the cases N \u03bc \u226b 1 and N \u03bc \u226a 1 is that, assuming the \u2206\u2206G\ndistribution remains relatively constant, when the population size is sufficiently large, the distribution of protein stabilities no longer fluctuates in a manner that influences the probability\nof a substitution (Equation 3 contains \u03bcV in the first term on the right side, while Equation 15\ndoes not).\nIn summary, we have presented a mathematical theory of how thermodynamics shape neutral protein evolution. A major strength of our theory is that it makes quantitative predictions\nusing single-mutant \u2206\u2206G values, which can be experimentally measured. Our work also\nsuggests how neutral and adaptive protein evolution may be coupled through protein thermodynamics. Protein stability represents an important hidden dimension in the evolution of new\nprotein function, since extra stability that is itself neutral can allow a protein to tolerate mutations that confer new or improved functions (B LOOM et al. 2006). Our theory describes the\ndynamics of protein stability during neutral evolution - adaptive protein evolution is super-\n\n30\n\n\fimposed on these stability dynamics, with proteins most likely to acquire beneficial mutations\nwhen they are most stable.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nWe thank Frances H.

We show that the results so obtained are identical to those\nfound in the main text, where we analyzed the forward-time process to compute the mean and\nvariation in the number of mutations across the population of evolving proteins.\nWhen N \u03bc \u226b 1, the population is now never converged to a single sequence, so it is not a\npriori obvious that the average number of mutations present in the population is equivalent to\nthe expected number of fixed substitutions along the line of descent. In fact, in the limit of very\nlarge population sizes there may not even be a common line of descent in relevant time frames,\nsince many new mutations will occur before any given mutation goes to fixation. In the main\ntext we calculated the average number of mutations hmiT,\u221e a sequence in the population has\naccumulated over the last T generations by treating the forward evolution of the population.\nHere we trace a randomly chosen protein in the population back in time, and show that the\naverage number of substitutions hsiT that it has accumulated over the last T generations is\nequal to hmiT,\u221e . We also show that indices of dispersion of hmiT,\u221e and hsiT have the same\nvalue of RT,\u221e .\nTo calculate hsiT , we first define a vector a giving the ancestor distribution (H ERMISSON et al. 2002):\n38\n\n\felement i of a (T \u2212 t) gives the probability that a randomly chosen sequence from the population at time T had a predecessor with stability in bin i at time T \u2212t. The transition probabilities\nof a (T \u2212 t) when the population is in equilibrium are the discrete time analogue of those computed by H ERMISSON et al. (2002). From Equation 15 of the main text, it follows that the\nfraction of sequences in bin i at time t + 1 that had as their ancestor in the previous generation\na sequence in bin j is \u03b1t [(1 \u2212 \u03bc) \u03b4ij + \u03bcWij ] xj (t). In order to obtain the probability that a\nsequence in bin i at time t + 1 had an ancestor in bin j, we have to divide this fraction by the\ntotal number of sequences in bin i at time t + 1. When the population is at equilibrium, \u03b1t = \u03b1\nand xi (t + 1) = xi (t) = xi where xi is the element from x\u221e . Hence, the probability that a\nsequence in bin i had an ancestor in bin j is \u03b1 [(1 \u2212 \u03bc) \u03b4ij + \u03bcHji ], where we have defined\nHji = Wij xj /xi ,\n\n(20)\n\na (T \u2212 t) = \u03b1 [(1 \u2212 \u03bc) I + \u03bcH] a (T \u2212 t + 1) ,\n\n(21)\n\nThe time evolution of a is therefore\n\nwhere the matrix H is defined by Equation 20. Equation 21 can be solved to show that the\nequilibrium value of a is a\u221e satisfying\nh\u03bdi\u221e a\u221e = Ha\u221e .\n\n(22)\n\nIf we define a (s, T \u2212 t) as the vector with element i giving the probability that a randomly\nchosen sequence at time T had a predecessor at time T \u2212 t in stability bin i and with s substitutions relative to the sequence at time T , then the time evolution for an equilibrated population\n\n39\n\n\fis\na (s, T \u2212 t \u2212 1) = \u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03bc) a (s, T \u2212 t) + \u03b1\u03bcHa (s \u2212 1, T \u2212 t) .\n\n(23)\n\nWe can solve Equations 23 and 22 in a manner analogous to the forward process to obtain\n\u0012 \u0013\nt t\n\u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03bc)t\u2212s (\u03bch\u03bdi\u221e )s a\u221e .\na (s, T \u2212 t) =\ns\n\n(24)\n\nAgain defining a (s, T \u2212 t) = ea (s, T \u2212 t) as the probability of having accumulated s substitutions as one moves back t generations from time T , we obtain the binomial distribution\n\u0012 \u0013\nt t\n\u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03bc)t\u2212s (\u03bch\u03bdi\u221e )s .\na (s, T \u2212 t) =\ns\n\n(25)\n\nComparison of Equation 17 of the main text and Equation 25 shows that they are identical.\nTherefore, all moments computed from the two distributions must be equal. In particular, this\nproves that hmiT,\u221e = hsiT , and that the corresponding indices of dispersion have the same\nvalue of RT,\u221e defined by Equation 19 of the main text. This shows that when N \u03bc \u226b 1, we\nexpect equivalent results regardless of whether we average over the number of mutations in\nall sequences present in the population, or randomly choose a single sequence and trace back\nalong its ancestor distribution.\n\n40\n\n\fList of Figures\n\n1\n\n2\n\nA thermodynamic view of protein evolution.
