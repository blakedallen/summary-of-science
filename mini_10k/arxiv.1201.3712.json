Introduction\n\nwith the mean photon number of the coherent\nlight and quadrature variance of the superposed\ncoherent and squeezed light, we undertake a\nprocedure of analysis based on combining the\nHamiltonians and using the usual definition for\nthe quadrature variance of the superposed light.\nFrom the results of our analysis, we discover\nthat the presence of the squeezed light has some\neffect on the mean photon number of the coherent light. This must certainly be due to the\nprocedure of analysis we have employed. Moreover, we find that the quadrature variance of\nthe superposed coherent and squeezed light is\nequal to that of the squeezed light only. In other\nwords, the coherent light has no contribution to\nthe quadrature variance of the superposed light.\nThe origin of this problem must be the use of\nthe usual definition for the quadrature variance\nof the superposed light.\n\nIt has been established that a one-mode subharmonic generator produces light with a maximum quadrature squeezing of 50% below the\ncoherent-state level [1-4]. In addition, some\nauthors [5-7] have studied the statistical and\nsqueezing properties of superposed coherent and\nsqueezed light, produced by harmonic and subharmonic generations in the same cavity. These\nauthors have carried out their analysis by combining the pertinent Hamiltonians and applying the usual definition for quadrature variance.\nBut such procedure leads to physically unjustifiable mean photon number of the coherent light\nand quadrature variance of the superposed coherent and squeezed light.\nIn order to see clearly the problems connected\n\u2217\n\nEmail address: fesseha@phys.aau.edu.et\n\n1\n\n\fthen note that the noise operator associated\nwith the vacuum reservoir has no effect on the\ndynamics of the cavity mode operators. Hence\nupon dropping this noise operator, the quantum Langevin equation for the operator \u00e2 can\nbe written as\n\nIn order to avoid the aforementioned problems, we calculate the mean photon number and\nquadrature variance of the superposed coherent and squeezed light, applying a procedure of\nanalysis based on superposing the Q functions\nand slightly modifying the usual definition for\nthe quadrature variance of the superposed light.\nWe also determine the quadrature squeezing of\nthe superposed cavity and output light.\n\nd\u00e2(t)\n1\n= \u2212 \u03ba\u00e2(t) \u2212 i[\u00e2(t), \u0124],\ndt\n2\n\nwhere \u03ba is the cavity damping constant.

Contrary to our expectation, the coherent light has no contribution to the quadrature variance of the superposed light. We maintain standpoint that the\nproblems connected with the first term in Eq.\n(22) and the quadrature variance described by\nEq. (28) could be resolved by carrying out the\npertinent analysis based on superposing the Q\nfunctions, instead of combining the Hamiltonians, and by slightly modifying the usual definition for the quadrature variance of superposed\nlight beams.\n\n(21)\n\nNow on account of (12) and (13), we see that\nh\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2i =\n\n(25)\n\nThis can be put in the form\n\n.\n(19)\n1+b\nFollowing the same procedure as the one leading to the result given by (17), we obtain from\nEqs.

(22) is the\nmean photon number of the squeezed light.\nHowever, the first term does not represent the\nmean photon number of the coherent light. The\nmean photon number of the coherent light is\njust the first term with \u03b52 = 0. We clearly see\nthat the presence of the squeezed light has some\neffect on the mean photon number of the coherent light. There cannot be any physically valid\njustification for this effect. The origin of the\nproblem connected with the first term in Eq.\n(22) must certainly be the procedure of analysis we used, which is based on combining the\nHamiltonians.\n\n3.
