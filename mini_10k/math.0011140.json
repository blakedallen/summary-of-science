Kishimoto\nDepartment of Mathematics, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060, Japan\nNovember 2000\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nBy a flow on a unital C \u2217 -algebra A we mean a strongly continuous one-parameter automorphism group. The infinitesimal generator \u03b4\u03b1 of a flow \u03b1 is a closed derivation in A, by\nwhich we mean that \u03b4\u03b1 is a closed linear operator which is defined on a dense *-algebra\nD(\u03b4\u03b1 ) and satisfies that \u03b4\u03b1 (x)\u2217 = \u03b4\u03b1 (x\u2217 ) and \u03b4\u03b1 (xy) = \u03b4\u03b1 (x)y + x\u03b4\u03b1 (y). See [1, 4, 17] for\nthe general theory of derivations.\nIf \u03b1 is a flow and u = (ut ) is a one-parameter family of unitaries of A such that t 7\u2192 ut\nis continuous and us \u03b1s (ut ) = us+t for all s, t \u2208 R, we say that u is an \u03b1-cocycle. Then\nAd u\u03b1 : t 7\u2192 Ad u\u03b1t is a flow and is called a cocycle perturbation of \u03b1. If u is differentiable\nwith\ndut\n|t=0 ,\nh = \u2212i\ndt\nthen Ad u\u03b1 is an inner perturbation of \u03b1 in the sense that \u03b4Ad u\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b1 + ad ih, where ad ih\nis the inner derivation defined by ad ih(x) = i(hx \u2212 xh) for x \u2208 A. We write Ad u\u03b1 also\nas \u03b1(h) in this case.\nIf v is a unitary which is not in the domain D(\u03b4\u03b1 ), then the flow\nAd v \u03b1 Ad v \u2217 : t 7\u2192 Ad v\u03b1t (v \u2217 ) \u03b1t ,\nwhich is conjugate to \u03b1, is a cocycle perturbation of \u03b1 but not an inner perturbation. In\ngeneral a cocycle perturbation is conjugate to an inner perturbation since any \u03b1-cocycle\nu is cohomologous to a differentiable one w, i.e., ut = vwt \u03b1t (v \u2217 ) for some unitary v (see\n[12]).\nBy an inner flow we mean a flow given by t 7\u2192 Ad eiht = et adih for some self-adjoint\nelement h in A. We say that \u03b1 is approximately inner if there is a sequence (hn ) in Asa\nsuch that \u03b1t = lim Ad eihn t , i.e., \u03b1t (x) = lim Ad eihn t (x) for every t \u2208 R and x \u2208 A, or\nequivalently, uniformly continuous in t on every compact subset of R and every x \u2208 A.\nWhen A is an AF C \u2217 -algebra, we call \u03b1 an AF flow if there is an increasing sequence (An ) of finite-dimensional C \u2217 -subalgebras of A such that 1A \u2208 A1 , A = \u222an An\nand \u03b1t (An ) = An for all n and t. In this case there is an hn in (An )sa such that\n1\n\n\f\u03b1t |An = Ad eihn t |An and hence \u03b1 is approximately inner. (The term AF flow is coined\nin [2] while the adjective locally representable is used in [12] and elsewhere to refer to the\nsame object.)\nWhen A is a UHF C \u2217 -algebra, we call \u03b1 a UHF flow if there is an increasing sequence\n(An ) of full matrix C \u2217 -subalgebras of A such that 1A \u2208 A1 , A = \u222an An , and \u03b1t (An ) = An\nN\nfor all n and t. If we set Bn = An \u2229 A\u2032n\u22121 with A0 = 0, then A \u223c\n= \u221e\n1 Bn and \u03b1t (Bn ) = Bn\nfor all n. Namely \u03b1 is of infinite tensor product type. Note that UHF flows are AF\nflows and there are AF flows on UHF C \u2217 -algebras which are not UHF flows. This follows\nbecause there are AF flows which have more than one KMS states for some temperature\nwhile UHF flows always have a unique KMS state for any temperature (see e.g., [12]).\nWe call \u03b1 a compact flow if the closure of \u03b1R in Aut(A), the automorphism group of\nA, is compact, or equivalently, if there is an increasing sequence (Vn ) of finite-dimensional\nsubspaces of A such that A = \u222an Vn and \u03b1t (Vn ) = Vn for all n and t. A periodic flow is\ncompact but there are more. If \u03b1 is an AF flow, then it is compact.\nIn [13] we refer to locally inner (or locally representable) flows as a generalization\nof AF flows. That is, a flow \u03b1 is locally inner if there is an increasing sequence (An )\nof (arbitrary) C \u2217 -subalgebras of A such that A = \u222an An and \u03b1 leaves An invariant and\nrestricts to an inner flow on An . Apparently AF flows are locally inner and locally inner\nflows are approximately inner. But there seems to be no obvious relation between compact\nflows and locally inner flows.\nWhen A is a UHF C \u2217 -algebra, we have the following implications for flows:\nUHF flows \u21d2 AF flows\n\n(\n\n\u21d2 Locally inner f lows\n\u21d2 Compact f lows\n\nwhere the reverse implications are false (for the latter note that the examples of non-AF\nflows constructed in [13] are locally inner and compact).\nThere is certainly a non-compact flow (e.g., a flow with some asymptotic abelianess),\nbut we do not seem to know if there is a flow which is not even a cocycle perturbation of\na compact flow. If there is a flow which is not approximately inner (against the PowersSakai Conjecture [17]), it is likely that we have such a one among the compact (or even\nperiodic) flows since there is such a one for some simple AF C \u2217 -algebra, which is obtained\nfrom [14] and Lin's classification theorem for simple C \u2217 -algebras of tracial topological\nrank zero. Hence there may be no inclusion relation between the compact flows and the\napproximately inner flows.\nIn this note we will briefly discuss compact flows and then look into UHF flows, a\nsimplest kind of flows!\nWe will show in 2.2 that if \u03b1 is an approximately inner compact flow on A, then the\ndomain D(\u03b4\u03b1 ) of the generator \u03b4\u03b1 contains a maximal abelian C \u2217 -subalgebra (masa for\nshort) of A, a property which obviously holds for locally inner flows. We here refer to a\nresult that the AF flows are characterized by the property that the domain contains a\ncanonical AF masa (see [13] for details).\n\n2\n\n\fWhen A is a UHF C \u2217 -algebra such that A \u2297 A \u223c\n= A, we call a UHF flow \u03b3 on A\nuniversal if \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 is cocycle conjugate to \u03b3 for any UHF flow \u03b1 on A (i.e., there is an\nisomorphism \u03c6 of A \u2297 A onto A such that \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 is a cocycle perturbation of \u03c6\u22121 \u03b3\u03c6).\nThere exist universal UHF flows on A (as shown in 3.1) and they are mutually cocycle\nconjugate, or even almost conjugate (see 4.5). In the case of the CAR algebras we will\nconstruct a universal UHF flow in a simple way extending a result given in [12]; see 5.1.\nWhen \u03b1 is a flow on A and \u03c3 is the flip automorphism of A \u2297 A, i.e., \u03c3(x \u2297 y) =\ny \u2297 x, x, y \u2208 A, we say that \u03c3 is \u03b1-invariantly approximately inner if there is a sequence\n(un ) of unitaries in A \u2297 A such that \u03c3 = lim Ad un and k(\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t )(un ) \u2212 un k\u21920 for each\nt \u2208 R, or equivalently uniformly in t on every compact subset of R. We shall prove for an\napproximately inner flow \u03b1 that \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 is a cocycle perturbation of a (universal) UHF flow\nif and only if \u03c3 is \u03b1-invariantly approximately inner, where \u03b3 is a universal UHF flow;\nsee 4.6. We do not really have any application of this result (except for a result on quasiUHF flows; see 4.7) but this is a first attempt to characterize UHF flows; see [13, 2] for\nsome results on AF flows. We shall also note that if the flip is \u03b1-smoothly approximately\ninner, i.e., if we replace the condition k(\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t )(un ) \u2212 un k\u21920 by that (\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t (un )) is\nequi-continuous in the above definition, then \u03b1 has a unique KMS state for each inverse\ntemperature, see 4.3. This follows from [8] and applies to the one-dimensional quantum\nlattice systems, thus providing another proof of the well-known uniqueness result.\n\n2\n\nCompact flows\n\nProposition 2.1 Let A be a separable C \u2217 -algebra and \u03b1 a flow on A. Then the following\nconditions are equivalent:\n1. The closure of {\u03b1t | t \u2208 R} in Aut(A) is compact.\n2. For each x \u2208 A the closure of {\u03b1t (x) | t \u2208 R} is compact.\n3. For each x of a dense subset of A the closure of {\u03b1t (x) | t \u2208 R} is compact.\n4. The linear span of Ap = {x \u2208 A | \u03b1t (x) = eipt x} for all p \u2208 R is dense in A.\n5. There is an increasing sequence (Vn ) of finite-dimensional subspaces of A such that\nA = \u222an Vn and \u03b1t (Vn ) = Vn for all n and t.\nProof. (1)\u21d2(2)\u21d2(3) is obvious. To show that (3)\u21d2(1) let (xn ) be a dense sequence\n(xn ) in the dense subset of A given in (3) and let (tn ) be a sequence in R; then there is\na subsequence (tn(k) ) such that both (\u03b1tn(k) (xm )) and (\u03b1\u2212tn(k) (xm )) converge for any m.\nThen the (strong) limit of (\u03b1tn(k) ) exists as an automorphism. This implies (1).\nIf (1) holds, then the closure of \u03b1R is a compact abelian group and hence (4) follows.\nIt is immediate that (4)\u21d2(5)\u21d2(3).\nWe recall that \u03b1 is said to be a compact flow if the conditions in 2.1 are satisfied.\n3\n\n\fProposition 2.2 Let A be a unital separable simple C \u2217 -algebra and \u03b1 a flow on A. If\n\u03b1 is an approximately inner compact flow, then D(\u03b4\u03b1 ) contains a maximal abelian C \u2217 subalgebra of A.\nProof. Since \u03b1 is approximately inner, \u03b1 has a pure ground state \u03c9. If G denotes the\nclosure of \u03b1R , then \u03c9 is left invariant under G. Thus the GNS representation associated\nwith \u03c9 is a G-covariant irreducible representation \u03c0 of A. Since A is simple, \u03c0 is faithful.\nLet U be a continuous representation of G on H\u03c0 such that Ug \u03c0(x)Ug\u2217 = \u03c0g(x) for\nP\nx \u2208 A. There is an orthogonal family (Ep )p\u2208\u011c of projections such that Ug = p < g, p >\nEp , where \u011c is the character group of G; \u011c is a countable discrete abelian group. Let\nAG = {x \u2208 A | \u2200g \u2208 G, g(x) = x} and denote by \u03c0p the representation of AG on Ep H\u03c0 ,\ni.e., \u03c0p (a) = \u03c0(a)|Ep H\u03c0 , a \u2208 AG . It follows that {\u03c0p | p \u2208 \u011c} is a disjoint family of\nirreducible representations of AG since \u03c0(AG )\u2032 = UG\u2032\u2032 . Under this circumstance we will\nshow that there is a maximal abelian C \u2217 -subalgebra (masa) of AG which is also a masa\nin A.\nBy the following lemma there is an h \u2208 (AG )sa such that \u03c0(h) \u223c\n= \u2295p\u2208\u011c \u03c0p (h) is diagonal\nand all the eigenvalues of \u03c0(h) have multiplicity one. Let C be a masa of AG such that\nC \u220b h. Since A \u2229 C \u2032 is G-invariant, A \u2229 C \u2032 is the closed linear span of the eigenspaces of\nG|A\u2229C \u2032 . Let x \u2208 A\u2229C \u2032 be a nonzero element such that g(x) =< g, q > x, g \u2208 G for some\nq \u2208 \u011c. Then there must be a p \u2208 \u011c and a unit vector \u03be in Ep H such that \u03c0(x)\u03be 6= 0 and\n\u03c0(h)\u03be = \u03bb\u03be for some \u03bb \u2208 R. Since \u03c0(x)\u03be \u2208 Ep+q H and \u03c0(h)\u03c0(x)\u03be = \u03c0(x)\u03c0(h)\u03be = \u03bb\u03c0(x)\u03be,\n\u03c0(x)\u03be is a constant multiple of \u03be. This implies that q = 0 and then x \u2208 C. Thus we can\nconclude that C is a masa in A.\nLemma 2.3 Let A be a separable C \u2217 -algebra and let (\u03c0n ) be a sequence of irreducible\nrepresentations of A such that if m 6= n then \u03c0m is disjoint from \u03c0n . If (Sn ) is a sequence of\ndense subsets of R then there is an h \u2208 Asa such that \u03c0n (h) is diagonal and PSp(\u03c0n (h)) \u2282\nSn for all n. Furthermore h can be chosen so that all the eigenvalues of \u03c0n (h) have\nmultiplicity one for every n.\nProof. We will construct a sequence (hn ) in Asa and an increasing sequence (ekn )n\u2265k of\nfinite-dimensional projections on Hk = H\u03c0k for each k such that khn k < 2\u2212n , limn ekn = 1,\n\u03c0k (hn )ek,n\u22121 = 0 for k = 1, 2, . . . , n \u2212 1, and for Hn = h1 + h2 + * * * + hn ,\n[\u03c0k (Hn ), ekn ] = 0, k = 1, 2, . . . , n\nPSp(\u03c0k (Hn )|ekn Hk ) \u2282 Sk , k = 1, 2, . . . , n,\nwhere PSp denotes the set of eigenvalues. Then we will let h = limn Hn and then since\n\u03c0k (h)ek,n = \u03c0k (Hn )ekn , we will have that PSp(\u03c0k (h)) \u2282 Sk for all k.\nTo construct such sequences as above, we will argue inductively by using Kadison's transitivity theorem (see, e.g., 1.21.16 of [18]). Suppose that we have constructed\nh1 , h2 , . . . , hn and ekm with n \u2265 m \u2265 k satisfying the above conditions. With Hn =\n4\n\n\fh1 + * * * hn let Ek be the spectral measure of \u03c0k (Hn ) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1. For each k we\nfind a finite family Fk of disjoint translates of [0, 2\u2212n\u22121 ) and a family {\u03be(I)}I\u2208Fk of unit vectors in (1\u2212ekn )Hk such that Ek (I)\u03be(I) = \u03be(I) and the linear span of \u03be(I), I \u2208 Fk is so large\nthat it almost contains any prescribed vector from (1 \u2212 ekn )Hk . Choose \u03bbI \u2208 Sk \u2229 I and\nlet PI denote the projection onto the linear space spanned by \u03be(I) and (\u03c0k (Hn ) \u2212 \u03bbI )\u03be(I).\nP\nThen the family (PI )I\u2208Fk is mutually orthogonal and the sum Pk = I PI is orthogonal\nP\nP\nto ekn . It follows that kPk (\u03c0k (Hn ) \u2212 I \u03bbI PI )Pk k = k I PI (\u03c0k (Hn ) \u2212 \u03bbI PI )PI k < 2\u2212n\u22121 .\nWe will then choose an hn+1 \u2208 Asa such that khn+1 k \u2264 2\u2212n\u22121 , [\u03c0k (hn+1 ), Pk ] = 0 for\nP\nk \u2264 n + 1, \u03c0k (hn+1 )ekn = 0 for k \u2264 n, and \u03c0k (hn+1 )Pk = \u2212(\u03c0k (Hn ) \u2212 I \u03bbI PI )Pk for\nk = 1, 2, . . . , n + 1. Then we obtain that \u03c0k (Hn + hn+1 )\u03be(I) = \u03bb(I)\u03be(I). We let ek,n+1 be\nthe sum of ekn (0 if k = n + 1) and the projection onto the linear span of \u03be(I), I \u2208 Fk .\nThus we have constructed hn+1 , ek,n+1 as required. (A similar argument is used in [9].)\nRemark 2.4 In 2.2 the assumption that \u03b1 is approximately inner is made to ensure that\nthere is a G-covariant irreducible representation for G = \u03b1R . This assumption certainly is\nnot necessary as we can see from the following example. If \u03b1 is a flow on the Cuntz algebra\nO2 = C \u2217 (s1 , s2 ) such that \u03b1t (sj ) = ei\u03bcj t sj , where \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 are rationally independent, then\n\u03b1 is compact and G is the gauge action \u03b3 of T2 given by \u03b3z1 ,z2 (sj ) = zj sj . In this case\n\u03b1 is not approximately inner but \u03b3 has a covariant irreducible representation. Hence the\nconclusion of 2.2 follows for this \u03b1 (though it is easy to show that directly). On the\nother hand there is an example of a compact flow where G does not have a covariant\nirreducible representation. For example if \u03b1 is a flow on the irrational rotation C \u2217 algebra A\u03b8 = C \u2217 (u1 , u2 ) with u1 u2 = e2\u03c0i\u03b8 u2 u1 and \u03b8 irrational such that \u03b1t (uj ) = ei\u03bcj t uj ,\nwhere \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 are rationally independent, then G is the gauge action \u03b3 of T2 given by\n\u03b3z1 ,z2 (uj ) = zj uj . Since \u03b3 is ergodic, only the tracial representation is covarint though\nthere is an \u03b1-covariant irreducible representation [9]. In this case we do not know whether\nthe domain D(\u03b4\u03b1 ) contains a masa or not.\n\n3\n\nUniversal UHF flows\nac\n\nWe say that a flow \u03b1 on A is almost conjugate to a flow \u03b2 on B and denote it by \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2\nif for any \u01eb > 0 there is an isomorphism \u03c6 of A onto B such that k\u03b1t \u2212 \u03c6\u22121 \u03b2t \u03c6k < \u01eb for\nac\ncc\nt \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. If A (or B) is separable and simple and \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2, then \u03b1 \u223c \u03b2, i.e., \u03b1 is cocycle\nconjugate to \u03b2 (see 1.2 of [12]). To prove this we use the fact that if A is simple and\nk\u03b1t \u2212 \u03c6\u22121 \u03b2t \u03c6k < 2, then there is a unitary ut \u2208 A such that \u03b1t = Ad ut \u03c6\u22121 \u03b2t \u03c6. To get\nan \u03b1-cocycle from the family (ut ) of unitaries so obtained for small |t|, we may use 8.1 of\n[16], which requires separability.\nLet A be a UHF C \u2217 -algebra such that A \u2297 A \u223c\n= A. We recall that a flow \u03b3 on A is a\ncc\nuniversal UHF flow if \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 \u223c \u03b3 for any UHF flow \u03b1 on A.\nProposition 3.1 If A is a UHF C \u2217 -algebra such that A\u2297A \u223c\n= A, then there is a universal\nUHF flow \u03b3 on A.\n5\n\n\fProof. There exists a (finite or infinite) sequence (pi ) of prime numbers such that A \u223c\n=\nki k2\nkn\n.\nLet\nS\nbe\nthe\nset\nof\nintegers\nwhich\nare\nof\nthe\nform\np\np\n*\n*\n*\np\nwith\nk\n\u2265\n0.\n\u2297i Mp\u221e\ni\n1 2\nn\ni\n\u223c\nThen it follows that A = \u2297q\u2208S Mq\u221e . For each q \u2208 S let (hn ) be a dense sequence in the\nself-adjoint diagonal matrices of Mq . We define a flow \u03b3 (q) on the UHF C \u2217 -algebra Mq\u221e\nby\n\u221e\nO\n\nAd eithn\n\nn=1\n(q)\n\nand define a flow \u03b3 on A by \u2297q\u2208S \u03b3 .\nIf \u03b1 is a UHF flow on A, then there are an infinite sequence (qn ) in S and a sequence\n(kn ) with kn \u2208 Mqn being self-adjoint and diagonal such that \u03b1 is conjugate to\n\u221e\nO\n\nAd eitkn .\n\nn=1\n\nHence \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 is of the same form as \u03b3 = \u2297q\u2208S \u03b3 (q) (by tensoring \u03b3 (q) with \u2297n:qn =q Ad eitkn )\nbut the sequence (h\u2032n ) defining the flow on Mq\u221e may be different from the (hn ) defining\n\u03b3 (q) for some q \u2208 S. But since they are dense in the self-adjoint diagonal matrices of Mq\u221e\ncc\nfor any q \u2208 S, we can conclude that \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 is cocycle conjugate to \u03b3, i.e., \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 \u223c \u03b3. (As\nac\na matter of fact \u03b3 \u2297 \u03b1 \u223c \u03b3.)\nLet F (A) denote the set of flows on A. We give a topology on F (A) by\nd(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n2\u2212n max k\u03b1t (xn ) \u2212 \u03b2t (xn )k,\n\nn=1\n\n|t|\u22641\n\nwhere (xn ) is a dense sequence of the unit ball of A. That is, \u03b1n converges to \u03b1 if \u03b1nt (x)\nconverges to \u03b1t (x) uniformly in t on [\u22121, 1] for all x \u2208 A. Let AIF (A) denote the set of\napproximately inner flows on A, i.e., the closure of inner flows.\nProposition 3.2 Let A be a UHF C \u2217 -algebra such that A \u2297 A \u223c\n= A and \u03b3 a universal\nUHF flow on A. Then\n{\u03c6\u22121 \u03b3\u03c6 | \u03c6 \u2208 Aut(A)} \u2261 C(\u03b3)\nis dense in AIF (A).\nProof. Let h \u2208 Asa . It suffices to show that the closure of C(\u03b3) contains the inner flow\nt 7\u2192 Ad eith .\ncc\nSince \u03b3 is a universal UHF flow, it follows that \u03b3 \u2297 (\u2297\u221e Ad eith ) \u223c \u03b3, i.e., there is an\nisomorphism \u03c6 of A \u2297 (\u2297\u221e A) \u2261 \u2297\u221e A onto A and a k \u2208 Asa such that\n\u03b3t \u2297 (\n\n\u221e\nO\n\n(k)\n\nAd eith ) = \u03c6\u22121 \u03b3t \u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03b3 (k) is the inner perturbation of \u03b3 by ad ik. Let \u03c6n denote the homomorphism of\nA into A obtained by restricting \u03c6 to the n + 1'st factor of \u2297\u221e A. Then we have that\nlim (\u03c6n Ad eith (x) \u2212 \u03b3t \u03c6n (x)) = 0\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n6\n\n\funiformly in t on [\u22121, 1] for every x \u2208 A. Since there are isomorphisms \u03c6\u0303n of A onto\nA such that lim(\u03c6n (x) \u2212 \u03c6\u0303n (x)) = 0 for every x \u2208 A, we may assume that \u03c6n 's are all\nisomorphisms of A onto A and obtain that Ad eith is the limit of \u03c6\u22121\nn \u03b3\u03c6n \u2208 C(\u03b3).\ncc\n\nRemark 3.3 If a flow \u03b1 absorbs the universal UHF flow \u03b3, i.e., \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1, then the\nclosure of C(\u03b1) contains AIF (A). This follows since for h \u2208 Asa ,\n\u03b1\u2297(\n\n\u221e\nO\n\ncc\n\nAd eith ) \u223c \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u2297 (\n\n\u221e\nO\n\ncc\n\ncc\n\nAd eith ) \u223c \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1.\n\nProposition 3.4 If A is a UHF C \u2217 -algebra such that A \u2297 A \u223c\n= A, then the universal\nUHF flows on A are mutually almost conjugate. In particular a cocycle perturbation of a\nuniversal UHF flow \u03b3 is almost conjugate to \u03b3.\ncc\n\nProof. If \u03b1 is a UHF flow and \u03b3 is a universal UHF flow, it follows that \u03b1\u221e \u2297 \u03b3 \u221e \u223c \u03b3,\nwhere \u03b1\u221e = \u2297\u221e \u03b1 etc. Hence for any \u01eb > 0 there exists a flow \u03c1 on A such that \u03b1\u221e \u2297\u03b3 \u221e \u2297\u03c1\nis conjugate to \u03b3 up to \u01eb (i.e., k\u03b1t\u221e \u2297\u03b3t\u221e \u2297\u03c1t \u2212\u03c6\u22121 \u03b3t \u03c6k < \u01eb for any t \u2208 [\u22121, 1] and for some\nisomorphism \u03c6 : A\u221e \u2192A). Hence \u03b1\u221e \u2297 \u03b3 \u221e \u2297 \u03c1 = \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1\u221e \u2297 \u03b3 \u221e \u2297 \u03c1 is conjugate to \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3\nac\nac\nac\nup to \u01eb. Hence \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3. If both \u03b1 and \u03b3 are universal, it follows that \u03b1 \u223c \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3.\nRemark 3.5 Let A be a UHF C \u2217 -algebra with A \u2297 A \u223c\n= A. Then there is a universal\nautomorphism \u03b3 of A in the sense that \u03b3\u2297\u03b1 is cocycle conjugate to \u03b3 for any automorphism\n\u03b1 of A. Namely an automorphism with the Rohlin property is universal (see, e.g., [3, 11,\n10, 7]). The universal automorphisms are mutually almost conjugate.\n\n4\n\nThe flip automorphism\n\nWhen A is a UHF C \u2217 -algebra, the flip automorphism \u03c3 of A \u2297 A defined by \u03c3(x \u2297 y) =\ny \u2297 x, x, y \u2208 A is approximately inner (since \u03c3 induces the identity map on K0 (A \u2297 A),\nwhich has rank one). Hence there is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in A \u2297 A such that\n\u03c3 = limn Ad un .\nLet \u03b1 be a flow on A. Since \u03c3(\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1) = (\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1)\u03c3, we can ask a question of whether\none can put an extra condition, in connection with \u03b1, on the sequence (un ) above.\nBefore turning to this special situation we present the following two propositions to\nclarify the conditions we are thinking of (cf. [8]).\nProposition 4.1 Let A be a unital C \u2217 -algebra and let \u03b1 be a flow on A and \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(A)\nsuch that \u03c3 \u22121 \u03b1\u03c3 = \u03b1. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n1. There is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in D(\u03b4\u03b1 ) such that \u03c3 = limn Ad un and\nsupn k\u03b4\u03b1 (un )k < \u221e.\n7\n\n\f2. There is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in A such that \u03c3 = limn Ad un and (t 7\u2192 \u03b1t (un ))\nare equi-continuous in n.\nProof. If (1) is satisfied, then so is (2) for the same (un ). To go from (2) to (1) we may\nneed to modify (un ). Since a similar technique will apply in the proof of the following\nproposition, we do not give it here.\nWe will express the conditions in the above proposition by saying that \u03c3 is \u03b1-smoothly\napproximately inner, which is weaker than the condition that \u03c3 is \u03b1-invariantly approximately inner, which will appear in the following.\nProposition 4.2 Let A be a unital C \u2217 -algebra and let \u03b1 be a flow on A and \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(A)\nsuch that \u03c3 \u22121 \u03b1\u03c3 = \u03b1. Then the following conditions are equivalent:\n1. There is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in D(\u03b4\u03b1 ) such that \u03c3 = limn Ad un and\nlimn k\u03b4\u03b1 (un )k = 0.\n2. There is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in A such that \u03c3 = limn Ad un and k\u03b1t (un ) \u2212\nun k\u21920 uniformly in t on every compact subset of R.\n3. There is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in A such that \u03c3 = limn Ad un and k\u03b1t (un ) \u2212\nun k\u21920 for every t \u2208 R.\nProof. It is obvious that (1)\u21d2(2)\u21d2(3).\n(3)\u21d2(2). Let \u01eb > 0 and define\nIn = {t \u2208 R | sup k\u03b1t (um ) \u2212 um k \u2264 \u01eb}.\nm\u2265n\n\nSince \u222an In = R and In 's are closed, \u222an In\u25e6 is dense in R by the Baire Category theorem,\nwhere In\u25e6 is the interior of In . If (a, a + \u03b4) \u2282 In\u25e6 for some a \u2208 R, \u03b4 > 0, and n, then\nk\u03b1t (um ) \u2212 um k \u2264 2\u01eb for t \u2208 (\u2212\u03b4, \u03b4) and m \u2265 n. Then the rest is easy.\n(2)\u21d2(1). Let f be a C \u221e -function on R with compact support such that f \u2265 0 and\nR\nf (t)dt = 1 and let, for a small \u01eb > 0,\nxn\u01eb = \u01eb\n\nZ\n\nf (\u01ebt)\u03b1t (un )dt.\n\nkxn\u01eb \u2212 un k \u2264 \u01eb\n\nZ\n\nf (\u01ebt)k\u03b1t (un ) \u2212 un kdt,\n\nSince\n\none can choose a sequence (\u01ebn ) such that \u01ebn \u0581 0 and kyn \u2212 un k\u21920 with yn = xn\u01ebn . Note\nthat yn \u2208 D(\u03b4\u03b1 ) and that\nZ\nk\u03b4\u03b1 (yn )k \u2264 \u01ebn\n\n|f \u2032 (t)|dt.\n\nIf we denote by vn the unitary obtained by the polar decomposition of yn , the sequence\n(vn ) satisfies the desired properties.\n\nIf a flow \u03b1 has more than one \u03b1-KMS states for some inverse temperature, the following\nshows that the flip is not \u03b1-smoothly approximately inner.\n8\n\n\fProposition 4.3 Let A be a UHF C \u2217 -algebra and \u03b1 a flow on A and suppose that the\nflip is \u03b1-smoothly approximately inner (or more precisely, \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1-smoothly approximately\ninner), i.e., the conditions in 4.1 are satisfied for A\u2297A, \u03b1 \u2297\u03b1, and the flip automorphism\n\u03c3 in place of A, \u03b1, and \u03c3 respectively. Then the the set of \u03b1-KMS states is a singleton\n(if not empty) for each inverse temperature.\nProof. Let \u03c9i be an \u03b1-KMS state at inverse temperature c \u2208 R for i = 1, 2. Then \u03c91 \u2297 \u03c92\nis an \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1-KMS state of A \u2297 A at c. Since the flip \u03c3 commutes with \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1 and the flip\nis \u03b1-smoothly approximately inner, the flip leaves each \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b1-KMS state invariant by the\nfollowing lemma, i.e., (\u03c91 \u2297 \u03c92 )\u03c3 = \u03c91 \u2297 \u03c92 or \u03c92 \u2297 \u03c91 = \u03c91 \u2297 \u03c92 . Hence \u03c91 = \u03c92 .\nThe following lemma is shown by M. Fannes et al [8] (or 5.3.33A of [4] vol. II), but\nwe will present another proof based on the definition of the KMS condition in terms of\nholomorphic functions.\nLemma 4.4 Let A be a unital C \u2217 -algebra and let \u03b1 be a flow and \u03c3 \u2208 Aut(A) such that\n\u03c3 \u22121 \u03b1\u03c3 = \u03b1. Suppose that \u03c3 is \u03b1-smoothly approximately inner. Then \u03c9\u03c3 = \u03c9 for any\n\u03b1-KMS states at inverse temperature c \u2208 R.\nProof. Let \u03c9 be an \u03b1-KMS state at inverse temperature c > 0. (The case c < 0 entails\njust some notational changes and the case c = 0 is trivial.) By definition, for any x, y \u2208 A\nthere is a bounded continuous function F (z) on Sc = {z \u2208 C | 0 \u2264 Iz \u2264 c} such that F\nis analytic in the interior of Sc and\nF (t) = \u03c9(x\u03b1t (y)), F (t + ic) = \u03c9(\u03b1t (y)x)\nfor t \u2208 R. Let (un ) be the sequence of unitaries as given in 4.1 and denote by Fn,x the\nfunction F obtained by taking un x for x and u\u2217n for y. In particular Fn,x satisfies\nFn,x (t) = \u03c9(un x\u03b1t (u\u2217n )), Fn,x (t + ic) = \u03c9(\u03b1t (u\u2217n )un x),\nfor t \u2208 R. Since t 7\u2192 \u03b1t (u\u2217n )un is equi-continuous in n, we may assume by passing to a\nsubsequence that Fn,y converges, for y = x and y = 1, uniformly on every compact subset\nof the boundary \u2202Sc . Then Fn,y converges, say to Fy , uniformly on every compact subset\nof Sc . It follows that Fy is a bounded continuous function on Sc which is analytic in the\ninterior.\nSuppose further that \u03c9 is factorial, which causes no loss of generality since the extreme\nKMS states are all factorial. Then since (\u03b1t (u\u2217n )un ) is central, it follows that \u03c9(\u03b1t (u\u2217n )un x)\nconverges to F1 (t + ic)\u03c9(x). This implies that Fx (z) = F1 (z)\u03c9(x) for z \u2208 R + ic and hence\nfor z \u2208 Sc . Since Fx (0) = \u03c9\u03c3(x) and F1 (0) = 1, we obtain that \u03c9\u03c3(x) = \u03c9(x). Hence\n\u03c9\u03c3 = \u03c9.\nWe may apply the above proposition 4.3 to the one-dimensional quantum lattice systems (since the bounded surface energy condition obviously implies that the flip is \u03b1smoothly approximately inner), where the uniqueness of KMS states is of course wellknown (see [17]). This is yet another proof.\n9\n\n\fWhen L is a bounded linear map of a C \u2217 -algebra B into a C \u2217 -algebra A, we denote by\nkLkcb the completely bounded norm defined by supn kL \u2297 idn k, where idn is the identity\nmap on the matrix algebra Mn so that L \u2297 idn is a linear map of B \u2297 Mn into A \u2297 Mn .\nIn the following proposition we will use such a norm when B is finite-dimensional and\nL is a difference of homomorphisms. In this case it follows from Christensen's result [5]\nthat for any \u01eb > 0 there is a \u03b4 > 0 such that if kLk < \u03b4 then kLkcb < \u01eb. (Because if\nL = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 has sufficiently small norm with \u03c6i a unital homomorphism of B into A, then\nthere is a unitary u \u2208 A such that ku \u2212 1k is small and \u03c62 = Ad u\u03c61 , which entails that\nkLkcb = k(id \u2212 Ad u)\u03c61kcb \u2264 2ku \u2212 1k.)\nProposition 4.5 Let A be a UHF C \u2217 -algebra with A\u2297A \u223c\n= A and \u03b1 a flow on A.

Let \u03c3 denote the flip of A \u2297 A. By the assumption on \u03b1 there exists a unitary\nu \u2208 A \u2297 A such that\nAd u|A1 \u2297 A1 = \u03c3|A1 \u2297 A1 ,\nmax k\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t (u) \u2212 uk < \u01eb/2.\nt\u2208I\n\nWe may suppose that there is a finite type I subfactor B of A such that B \u2297 B \u220b u and\nB \u2283 A1 .\nBy using the (\u03c6n ) and \u03c6 in the statement, we define linear maps \u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n and \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6n of\nthe algebraic tensor product A \u2299 A into A by\n\u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n (x \u2297 y) = x\u03c6n (y),\n\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6n (x \u2297 y) = \u03c6(x)\u03c6n (y).\nSince (\u03c6n (y)) is a central sequence for any y \u2208 A, both \u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n and \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6n are approximate\nhomomorphisms. Thus \u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n (u) and \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6n (u) are close to unitaries for the u \u2208 B \u2297 B\nabove for all large n.\nSince\nk\u03b1t (\u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n )(u) \u2212 \u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n (\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t (u))k\n\n10\n\n\fconverges to zero uniformly in t \u2208 I, we obtain that\nk\u03b1t (\u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n )(u) \u2212 \u03b9 \u2297 \u03c6n (u)k < \u01eb/2\nfor t \u2208 I and for all large n.\nP\nFor a finite sum i xi \u2297 yi \u2208 B \u2297 B it follows that\nk\u03b1t (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6n )(\n\nX\n\nxi \u2297 yi ) \u2212 (\u03c6 \u2297 \u03c6n )(\n\nX\n\n\u03b1t (xi ) \u2297 \u03b1t (yi ))k\n\ni\n\ni\n\nconverges to\nk\n\nX\n\n\u03b1t \u03c6(xi ) \u2297 \u03b1t (yi ) \u2212\n\ni\n\nX\n\n\u03c6\u03b1t (xi ) \u2297 \u03b1t (yi )k\n\ni\n\nwhich is less than or equal to k(\u03b1t \u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b1t )|Bkcb k\n\nP\n\ni\n\nxi \u2297 yi k.

Thus, by choosing a sufficiently\nlarge n and taking the unitary part of the polar decomposition of yn , which is already\nclose to a unitary, we obtain the conclusion. (As a matter of fact k(Ad u \u2212 \u03c6)|A1 k can be\nmade small independently of \u01eb.)\nTheorem 4.6 Let A be a UHF C \u2217 -algebra with A \u2297 A \u223c\n= A and \u03b3 a universal UHF flow\ncc\non A. If \u03b1 is an approximately inner flow on A such that \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u223c \u03b1, the following\nconditions are equivalent:\ncc\n\n1. \u03b1 \u223c \u03b3;\n2. The flip is \u03b1-invariantly approximately inner.\n\n11\n\n\fProof. (1)\u21d2(2). We may assume that \u03b1 is an inner perturbation of \u03b3, i.e., \u03b4\u03b1 = \u03b4\u03b3 + ad ih\nfor some h \u2208 Asa . We know that there is a sequence (un ) of unitaries in D(\u03b4\u03b3 ) \u2299 D(\u03b4\u03b3 )\nsuch that u\u2217n = un , \u03b4\u03b3\u2297\u03b3 (un ) = 0, and \u03c3 = limn Ad un , where \u03c3 is the flip of A \u2297 A. Hence\nit follows that un \u2208 D(\u03b4\u03b1\u2297\u03b1 ) and that\n\u03b4\u03b1\u2297\u03b1 (un ) = ad(ih \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 ih)(un ) = (ih \u2297 1)un \u2212 un (1 \u2297 ih) + (1 \u2297 ih)un \u2212 un (ih \u2297 1)\nconverges to zero. This is what we wanted to show; see 4.2.\ncc\n(2)\u21d2(1). Since \u03b3 \u221e \u223c \u03b3, we see that there is a sequence (\u03c6n ) in Aut(A) such that\n\u03c6\u22121\nn \u03b3\u03c6n \u2192\u03b3 and (\u03c6n (x)) is central for any x \u2208 A. Since \u03b1 is an approximately inner flow\ncc\nsatisfying \u03b1 \u223c \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 \u221e and any inner flow can be embedded into \u03b3, we see that \u03b1 also\nsatisfies the above condition. Since the flip is both \u03b3 and \u03b1-invariantly approximately\ninner, we can apply 4.5 to both of them.\nLet (An ) be an increasing sequence of finite type I subfactors of A with A = \u222an An .\nLet \u01eb > 0.

We then\nchoose B2 for A2 , \u03b3, and 2\u22122 \u01eb by 4.5 and choose \u03c62 \u2208 Aut(A) by 3.3 such that for t \u2208 I,\n\u22123\nk(\u03b3t \u2212 \u03c6\u22121\n2 \u03b1t \u03c62 )|B2 kcb < 2 \u01eb.\n\nHere we again assume that \u03c62 (B2 ) \u2282 A3 as above.

Hence we get that k(\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t )(un ) \u2212 un k \u2264 7\u01ebn for t \u2208 I.\nSince there is a sequence (wn ) of unitaries in A \u2297 A such that \u03c3 = lim Ad wn and\n\u03b3t \u2297 \u03b3t (wn ) = wn , we have that the sequence (un \u2297 wn ) satisfies that \u03c3 = lim Ad(un \u2297 wn )\nand k(\u03b1t \u2297 \u03b1t \u2297 \u03b3t \u2297 \u03b3t )(un \u2297 wn ) \u2212 un \u2297 wn k\u21920 uniformly in t \u2208 I, i.e., the flip is\n\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3-invariantly approximately inner. By the previous theorem we can conclude that\n\u03b1 \u2297 \u03b3 is a cocycle perturbation of \u03b3.\n\n14\n\n\f5\n\nThe CAR algebra\n\nWhen A is the CAR algebra (i.e., A \u223c\n= M2\u221e ), we can give a universal flow in a simple\nway.\nTheorem 5.1 Let (\u03bbn ) be a sequence in R and define a UHF flow \u03b1 on A = M2\u221e by\n\u03b1t =\n\n\u221e\nO\n\nAd\n\nn=1\n\neit\u03bbn 0\n0\n1\n\n!\n\n.\n\nThen \u03b1 is a universal UHF flow on A if and only if there is a subsequence (\u03bbnk ) such that\nP\nlimk \u03bbnk = 0 and k \u03bb2nk = \u221e.\nProof. If \u03b1 is a universal UHF flow, then the \u03c4 bottom marginal spectrum of \u03b1 must be\nfull, i.e., \u0393\u03c4,\u2212 (\u03b1) = R+ , where \u03c4 is the tracial state of A (see [12]). If there is an \u01eb > 0\nP\nsuch that n:|\u03bbn|<\u01eb \u03bb2n < \u221e, then \u0393\u03c4,\u2212 (\u03b1) \u2282 [\u01eb, \u221e) by 5.3 of [12]. Hence there must be a\nP\nsubsequence (\u03bbnk ) such that limk \u03bbnk = 0 and k \u03bb2nk = \u221e.\nConversely suppose that (\u03bbn ) satisfies the required property. Let (\u03bcn ) be another\nsequence in R and denote by \u03b2 the UHF flow constructed as in the above statement.\ncc\nWhat we have shown in [12] is that \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 \u223c \u03b1 for all such \u03b2. Now what we have to show\ncc\nis that \u03b1 \u2297 \u03b2 \u223c \u03b1 for any UHF flow \u03b2. As in [12] this follows easily from the following\nlemma.\nLemma 5.2 Let (\u03bbn ) be a sequence in R as in the above theorem and let T be a finite\nsubset of R of order 2k . For any \u01eb > 0 there exist an N \u2208 N with N > k, a partition P\nof the power set PN of {1, 2, . . . , N} into 2N \u2212k sets of order 2k , and a map F of PN onto\nT such that for any S \u2208 P , F |S is bijective and\n|E(x) \u2212 E(y) \u2212 F (x) + F (y)| < \u01eb, x, y \u2208 S,\nwhere E(x) =\n\nP\n\ni\u2208x\n\n\u03bbi .\n\nProof. This lemma is shown in the case k = 1 in [12]. We will extend the proof there to\ncover the general case k > 1, at the same time using the result for the case k = 1.\nWe write the elements of T as \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . . , \u03bc2k in the increasing order. Since only the\ndifferences between \u03bci 's matter, we assume that \u03bc2k = \u2212\u03bc1 .\nFor a large N it is certainly not difficult to find a subset {x1 , x2 , . . . , x2k } of PN such\nthat (E(x1 ), E(x2 ), . . . , E(x2k )) is almost equal to (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . . , \u03bc2k ) + C for some C \u2208 R\nsince {E(x) | x \u2208 PN } is densely distributed in a large interval. We have to cover PN\nwith the disjoint union of such sets {x1 , x2 , . . . , x2k }. Then the map F : PN \u2192T is an\nobvious one.\nLet \u03bc0,i = \u03bci and\n1\n\u03bcj,i = (\u03bc2j (i\u22121)+1 + \u03bc2j i ), i = 1, 2, . . . , 2k\u2212j ,\n2\n15\n\n\ffor j = 1, 2, . . . , k. Since \u03bc2k = \u2212\u03bc1 , we have that \u03bck,1 = 0. For a fixed j, (\u03bcj,i) is\nincreasing in i and\n\u03bcj,2i\u22121 < \u03bcj+1,i < \u03bcj,2i .\nBy slightly changing \u03bci 's we may assume that all those \u03bcj,i 's belong to Z\u03b4 for some \u03b4 > 0,\nwhich is smaller than \u01eb. Furthermore, by using the result for k = 1, we may assume that\nall \u03bbn = \u03b4.\nFix a large N and define En (x) for x \u2208 PN and n \u2208 N with n \u2264 N by\nEn (x) =\n\nX\n1 X\n(\n\u03bbi \u2212\n\u03bbi )\n2 i\u2264n, i\u2208x\ni\u2264n, i6\u2208x\n\n= (\u266f{i \u2208 x| i \u2264 n} \u2212 n/2)\u03b4.\nWe say that x is good if there is a subsequence n1 , n2 , . . . , nk of even integers such that\nEnj (x) = \u03bck\u2212j, ij\nfor some ij ; in particular Enk (x) = \u03bcik . We will make the smallest possible choice for\neach nj inductively for j = 1, 2, . . . , k. Since \u03bck\u2212j\u22121,2i\u22121 < \u03bck\u2212j,i < \u03bck\u2212j\u22121,2i , this entails\nij+1 = 2ij \u2212 1 or 2ij .\nWe claim that if x is good, then x can be matched with other 2k \u2212 1 good elements of PN in a unique way so that the resulting sequence (x1 , x2 , . . . , x2k ) satisfies that\n(Enk (x1 ), Enk (x2 ), . . . , Enk (x2k )) exactly equals (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . . , \u03bc2k ). Since\nxi\n\n\\\n\n{nk + 1, nk + 2, . . . , N}\n\nis independent of i by the construction, it follows that (E(x1 ), E(x2 ), . . . , E(x2k )) is equal\nto (\u03bc1 , \u03bc2 , . . . , \u03bc2k ) + C for some C, where E(xi ) = EN (xi ).\nIf x is good as above, we define x\u2032 \u2208 PN by\nx\u2032 = x\u25b3{nk\u22121 + 1, nk\u22121 + 2, . . . , nk },\nwhere \u25b3 denotes difference of sets. Then x\u2032 is again good; Enj (x\u2032 ) = \u03bck\u2212j,ij for j =\n1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1 and Enk (x\u2032 ) = \u03bcl , where l = ik + 1 if ik is odd and otherwise l = ik \u2212 1. In\ngeneral if (\u03bck\u2212j,ij ) is monotone for j = m, m + 1, . . . , k, we define x\u2032 \u2208 PN by\nx\u2032 = x\u25b3{nm + 1, nm + 2, . . . , nk }.\nThen we have that x\u2032 is good and Enk (x\u2032 ) = \u03bcl , where l = 2k\u2212m im if ik is odd and\notherwise l = 2k\u2212m(im \u2212 1) + 1 (since \u03bck\u2212m,im = (\u03bc2k\u2212m (im \u22121)+1 + \u03bc2k\u2212m im )/2 and ik is\neither 2k\u2212m (im \u2212 1) + 1 or 2k\u2212mim by the monotonicity). If we make the smallest possible\nchoice of n\u2032j such that En\u2032j (x\u2032 ) = \u03bck\u2212j,i\u2032j , we have that n\u2032k = nk , where the latter is the\nchoice for x. We may call this process the reflection at (m, im ) or loosely at \u03bck\u2212m,im . By\napplying the above process inductively we can obtain the other 2k \u2212 1 good elements from\none good x, which form the desired set of order 2k . (To understand why we get a set\n16\n\n\fof 2k elements in this way we should visualize a binary tree of depth k with each node\nlabeled by \u03bcji such that the root is labeled by \u03bck1 = 0 and if a node is labeled by \u03bck\u2212j,i\nwith j < k or more precisely is addressed by (k \u2212 j, i), meaning that it is at a distance\nk \u2212 j from the root and at the i'th position from the left among the nodes of distance\nk \u2212 j from the root, then it has two children labeled by \u03bck\u2212j\u22121,2i\u22121 and \u03bck\u2212j\u22121,2i from left\nto right; so the leaves are labeled by \u03bc1 = \u03bc0,1 , \u03bc2, . . . , \u03bc2k from left to right. Any good\nelement x \u2208 PN corresponds to a path from the root to a leave of this binary tree, which\nis the path determined by (k \u2212 j, ij ), j = 0, 1, . . . , k with i0 = 1 and (ij ) as given in the\ndefinition of good. By the procedure indicated above we get 2k \u2212 1 elements corresponding\nto other 2k \u2212 1 paths. Note that to each interior node there is a reflection to be applied;\nand there are 2k \u2212 1 of them.)\nIn this way we obtain the family FN of such sets of order 2k . Since the procedure is\ncanonical, FN is a disjoint family. Let GN be the union of elements of FN . If x \u2208 PN \\ GN ,\nthen x is not good and in particular |En (x)| < \u03bc2k for all n = 1, 2, . . . , N.\nFor each k \u2208 Z with |k| < \u03bc2k /\u03b4 \u2261 K, we have that\n\u266f{x \u2208 PN \\ GN | E(x) = k\u03b4}\n\u266f{x \u2208 GN | E(x) = k\u03b4}\nconverges to zero as even N goes to infinity. Furthermore we have that\n\u266f(PN \\ GN )\nmin|k|\u2264K \u266f{x \u2208 GN | E(x) = k\u03b4}\nconverges to zero as even N goes to infinity (since the ratios among \u266f{x \u2208 GN | E(x) = k\u03b4}\nfor various k converge to 1).\nFor each x \u2208 PN \\ GN we specify a subset Sx of GN of order 2K + 1 such that\n{E(y) | y \u2208 Sx } = {k\u03b4 | |k| \u2264 K}.\nIf N is a sufficiently large even integer, we can specify Sx , x \u2208 PN \\ GN such that Sx 's\nare mutually disjoint.\nLet {x1 , x2 , . . . , x2k } be a subset of PN \\ GN . If E(x1 ) = k\u03b4, we make the following\nsubstitutions (simultaneously):\nyk\u22121 \u2190 x1 , yk\u22122 \u2190 yk\u22121 , . . . , y\u2212K \u2190 y\u2212K+1, x1 \u2190 y\u2212K ,\nwhere yk \u2208 Sx1 satisfies E(yk ) = k\u03b4. After these substitutions we have that E(x1 ) =\n\u2212K\u03b4 = \u03bc1 . By making suitable substitutions among {xi } \u222a Sxi for i = 2, . . . , 2k we have\nthat E(xi ) = \u03bci , i.e., {x1 , x2 , . . . , x2k } satisfies the desired property. By these substitutions\nwe have introduced only an error of \u03b4 to some sets belonging to FN , i.e., for S \u2208 FN\nmodified by these processes, the elements of S will be ordered as x1 , x2 , . . . , x2k so that\n|E(xi ) \u2212 \u03bci \u2212 C| = 0, \u00b1\u03b4 for all i and for some C. This completes the proof.\n\n17\n\n\fReferences\n[1] O. Bratteli, Derivations, dissipations and group actions on C \u2217 -algebras, Lecture Notes in\nMath. 1229, Springer, 1986.\n[2] O.
