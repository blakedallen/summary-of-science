INTRODUCTION\n\nIn the last few years there has been another wave of excitement regarding the question of\nneutrino masses. This is largely due to the many new experiments testing neutrino oscillations, most notably the positive indications obtained by Super Kamiokande on atmospheric\nneutrino oscillations [1]. Similar indications come from other experiments [2\u20135]. The solar\nneutrino experiments have for many years provided independent evidence for neutrino oscillations [6\u201310]. Accelerator and reactor experiments have also played an important role.\nThey have furnished strict bounds on neutrino oscillation parameters [11\u201316]. In the case of\nthe LSND experiment [16] at Los Alamos evidence for \u03bd \u03bc \u2192 \u03bd e oscillation has been reported.\nSee refs [17] for recent reviews.\n\nIt is hoped that new experimental results can be used to determine the neutrino squared\nmass differences and mixing angles. In turn, these may help to infer the neutrino mass\nmatrix. This is presumably a possible gateway to a more fundamental theory beyond the\nstandard model. Of course this is a highly speculative area, and even though there are\nmany imaginative proposals [18], it seems fair to say that the the true answer is essentially\nunknown. In order to make progress in this direction, it seems useful to investigate various\nplausible Ansatze for the neutrino mass matrix. From this point of view we propose the\nAnsatz for the 3 generation neutrino mass matrix, M\u03bd :\nTr(M\u03bd ) = 0\n\n(1.1)\n\nand investigate its consequences. We are considering the neutrinos to be represented by\n2-component spinors so that, in the most general situation, M\u03bd is an arbitrary symmetric\ncomplex matrix.\nAs we will see in section II, Eq. (1.1) can be motivated from an SO(10) grand unified\nmodel [19], in which it may be derived with some assumptions. Physically, Eq. (1.1)\ncorresponds to the well known approximate signature of grand unification that\n\nm(b)\nm(\u03c4 )\n\n\u2243 3.\n\nFurthermore we will see in sections IV and V that Eq. (1.1) can be straightforwardly\ncombined with experimental information to get an idea of the neutrino masses themselves\n\nas well as the \"texture\" of M\u03bd . Relevant matters of notation are discussed in section III\nwhile a summary is presented in section VI.\n\nII. PLAUSIBILITY OF THE ANSATZ\n\nIn the SO(10) grand unification model each generation contains one light massive two\ncomponent neutrino and also a very heavy one which is \"integrated out\" according to the\n1\n\n\f\"seesaw mechanism\" [20]. The effective 3 \u00d7 3 neutrino mass matrix takes the form:\nM\u03bd = ML \u2212 MDT MH MD\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere ML , MH and MD are respectively the mass matrices of the light neutrinos, heavy\nneutrinos and heavy-light mixing (or \"Dirac matrix\"). Generally the second, seesaw, term\nis considered to dominate. Here however we shall assume the first term to be the dominant\none. This is necessary for the present derivation of Eq. (1.1) to hold. Also, a rough order of\nmagnitude estimate for the second term would be\n\nm(\u03c4 )2\n1016 GeV\n\nor about 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 eV. Thus, the\n\nseesaw term could be negligible if neutrino masses turn out to be appreciably larger than\nthis value. Now in SO(10), Higgs mesons belonging to the 10, 120 and 126 representations\n\ncan contribute to the fermion masses at tree level. One has [21] for the down quark, charged\nlepton and light neutrino mass matrices,\n1\nMd = aS(10) + bA(120) \u2212 cS(126)\n3\nrMe = aS(10) + dA(120) + cS(126)\n\n(2.2)\n\nsML = eS(126)\nwhere a, b, c, d, e are numbers representing Higgs meson vacuum values. S(10), A(120) and\nS(126) are the matrices of the Yukawa type constants which couple the fermions to the 10,\n120 and 126 Higgs mesons respectively; the matrices S(10) and S(126) must be symmetric\nwhile A(120) is antisymmetric. Finally, r \u2243 3 is a renormalization factor for comparing the\n\nquark masses with the charged lepton masses at a low energy scale rather than at the grand\nunified scale; s is a similar factor for the neutrino masses. With the stated assumption that\nthe ML term dominates in Eq. (2.1) we get\nTr(M\u03bd ) \u221d Tr(Md ) \u2212 rTr(Me )\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhich clearly also holds when any number of 10's or 120's are present but only a single 126.\nThe matrices appearing in Eq. (2.3) are so far essentially unrestricted complex ones. To\nproceed, we make the further assumption that the matrices are hermitian. Then Md and\nMu may each be brought to diagonal form by unitary transformations. Thus the right hand\nside of Eq. (2.3) may be evaluated to yield approximately,\nTr(M\u03bd ) \u221d m(b) \u2212 rm(\u03c4 ) \u2243 0\n\n(2.4)\n\naccording to a well known numerical success, based on the observation that r \u2243 3, of grand\nunification [22]. Note that we have not needed to assume that the mass matrix has any\n2\n\n\fzero elements.\u2217 Even if the cancellation on the right hand side of Eq. (2.4) is not perfect,\nit should still be a good approximation. In an SO(10) model where the mass matrices are\nhermitian, M\u03bd will be real symmetric. We will investigate this case and also the possibility\nthat the more general case holds.\n\nIII. SOME NOTATION\n\nOur plan is to combine the Ansatz Eq. (1.1) with experimentally obtained results on\nneutrino oscillations in order to learn more about M\u03bd itself. For this purpose it may be\nhelpful to set down our notation [23] for the pieces of the effective SU(2)L \u00d7 U(1) theory\n\ninvolving neutrinos and to make some related remarks.\n\nThe free Lagrangian containing three two component massive fields is:\n1\nLf ree = \u2212i\u03c1\u2020 \u03c3\u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03c1 \u2212 (\u03c1T \u03c32 M\u03bd \u03c1 + h.c.),\n2\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere M\u03bd = M\u03bdT is the (not yet diagonalized) neutrino mass matrix of the underlying theory\nto be identified with the matrix in Eq. (1.1). Note that we are free to multiply the first\nmass term in Eq. (3.1) by an overall arbitrary phase which is a matter of convention. It is\npossible [23] to find a unitary matrix U which brings M\u03bd to real, positive, diagonal form in\nthe following way:\nU T M\u03bd U = M\u0302,\n\nM\u0302 = diag(m1 , m2 , m3 ).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe mass diagonal fields \u03bd are then\n\u03c1 = U\u03bd.\n\n(3.3)\n\nSimilarly, the column vector of left handed negatively charged leptons in the underlying\ntheory, EL is related to the mass diagonal fields eL by\nEL = \u03a9eL ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere \u03a9\u2020 = \u03a9\u22121 .\n\n\u2217 In\n\n[24] a similar mechanism was studied for MH where, in addition, a special combined Fritzsch-\n\nStech Ansatz was used. Here we are not making any special Ansatz of this type for the mass\nmatrices.\n\n3\n\n\fCombining factors from Eq. (3.3) and Eq. (3.4) we obtain the unitary mixing matrix,\nK for the charged current weak interaction,\nK = \u03a9\u2020 U.\n\n(3.5)\n\nig\nLint = \u221a W\u03bc\u2212 \u0113L \u03b3\u03bc K\u03bd + h.c.,\n2\n\n(3.6)\n\nThis appears in the Lagrangian term,\n\nwhere a conventional four component Dirac notation with \u03b35 diagonal is being employed and\n\u03bd has only the first two components non zero. Next we parameterize K [23]. It is possible\nto restrict detK = 1 by adjusting an overall phase which can be absorbed in \u0113L . Then we\nwrite\nK = \u03c90 (\u03b1)\u03c923 (\u03b723 , \u03c623 )\u03c912 (\u03b712 , \u03c612 )\u03c913 (\u03b713 , \u03c613 ),\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u03c90 (\u03b1) = diag(ei\u03b11 , ei\u03b12 , ei\u03b13 ),\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere\n\nwith \u03b13 = \u2212(\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) and, for example\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\ncos\u03b712\n\n\u03c912 (\u03b712 , \u03c612 ) = \uf8ef \u2212e\u2212i\u03c612 sin\u03b712\n0\n\nei\u03c612 sin\u03b712 0\ncos\u03b712\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n.\n0\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n1\n\n(3.9)\n\nEq. (3.7) contains the eight parameters needed to characterize an arbitrary unitary unimodular matrix. From the standpoint of Eq. (3.6) it can be further simplified by using the\nfreedom to rephase \u0113L \u2192 \u0113L \u03c90\u22121 (\u03b1) without changing the free part of the charged lepton\n\nLagrangian. On the other hand, the form of the mass terms in Eq. (3.1) shows that the\nneutrino fields can not be rephased. Thus a suitable minimal parameterization\u2020 for K in\n(3.6) is\nK = \u03c923 (\u03b723 , \u03c623 )\u03c912 (\u03b712 , \u03c612 )\u03c913 (\u03b713 , \u03c613 ),\n\n(3.10)\n\ninvolving three \"angles\", \u03b7ab and three \"phases\", \u03c6ab . Note the identity\n\u03c90 (\u03b1)\u03c9ab (\u03b7ab , \u03c6ab )\u03c90\u22121(\u03b1) = \u03c9ab (\u03b7ab , \u03b1a + \u03c6ab \u2212 \u03b1b ).\n\u2020 This\n\nis written out in detail in Eq (2) of [25]\n\n4\n\n(3.11)\n\n\fThis identity may be used to transfer two of the phases \u03c6ab in Eq. (3.7) to a diagonal matrix\non the right of K as, for example,\nK = \u03c923 (\u03b723 , 0)\u03c912 (\u03b712 , 0)\u03c913 (\u03b713 , \u03c613 )\u03c90\u22121(\u03c4 ),\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere \u03c41 + \u03c42 + \u03c43 = 0, which may be used instead of Eq. (3.10).\nWe also need the formula for the amplitude of neutrino oscillation. For the case when a\nneutrino, produced by a charged lepton of type a, \"oscillates\" to make at time t, a charged\nlepton of type b, we have\namp(a \u2192 b) =\n\nX\n\n\u2217\nKa\u03b1\nKb\u03b1 e\u2212iE\u03b1 t ,\n\n(3.13)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the sum goes over the neutrinos of definite mass, m\u03b1 . Inserting the parameterization\nEq. (3.12) into Eq. (3.13) shows that the effect of the factor \u03c90\u22121 (\u03c4 ) cancels out. Thus for\nordinary oscillations, K is parameterized by three angles and one CP violating phase as for\nthe CKM quark mixing matrix. On the other hand, the two additional CP violating phases\n\u03c41 and \u03c42 show up if one considers neutrino-antineutrino oscillations [26] or neutrinoless\ndouble beta decay [27]. The formula for the probability, Pab is gotten by taking the squared\nmagnitude of Eq. (3.13) and replacing the exponential factor E\u03b1 t by (E + m2\u03b1 /(2E))L,\nwhere E is the neutrino energy and L is the oscillation distance. For practical reasons it is\nvery important to take account of the experimental uncertainties in E and L. The simplest\napproximation [28] is to define b = L/(4E) and assume that one can smear Pab with a\nGaussian distribution in b. b0 is defined as the mean value and \u03c3b as the standard deviation\nappropriate to the particular physical setup. Then we find for the smeared probability\nhPab i = \u03b4ab \u2212 2\n\nX\n\n\u03b1<\u03b2\n\n[Re(f\u03b1\u03b2ab )(1 \u2212 cos(2b0 m2\u03b2\u03b1 )exp(\u22122\u03c3b2 (m2\u03b2\u03b1 )2 ))\n\n(3.14)\n\n+ Im(f\u03b1\u03b2ab )sin(2b0 m2\u03b2\u03b1 )exp(\u22122\u03c3b2 (m2\u03b2\u03b1 )2 )],\n\u2217\n\u2217\nKb\u03b2 and m2\u03b2\u03b1 = m2\u03b2 \u2212 m2\u03b1 . Notice that when Im(f\u03b1\u03b2ab ) = 0, hPab i\nKb\u03b1\nwhere f\u03b1\u03b2ab = Ka\u03b1 Ka\u03b2\n\nis independent of the sign of m2\u03b2\u03b1 .\n\nIV. LEARNING ABOUT M\u03bd FROM EXPERIMENT\n\nSince Tr (M\u03bd ) = 0 provides only two real equations for 12 real parameters, it is clear that\nit has a relatively small amount of predictivity. In particular it cannot say much about the\ntexture (e.g. possible zeroes) of M\u03bd which is suppposed to derive from a deeper theory than\nthe standard model. On the other hand, we shall see that our Ansatz is complementary to\n5\n\n\fthe results which should emerge from analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments. Together,\nthey should enable us to actually (with some conditions) reconstruct M\u03bd .\nFirst, in this section, we shall consider M\u03bd to be hermitian so that the argument in favor\nof Tr (M\u03bd ) = 0 presented in section II holds without any further assumptions. Since M\u03bd is\nsymmetric it must be real. It can be brought to real diagonal form via a real rotation R\nas RT M\u03bd R. However there is no guarantee that all eigenvalues of M\u03bd will be positive. We\ncan make them all positive by rephasing the diagonal fields with negative eigenvalues by a\nfactor i (see Eqs. (3.1) and (3.2)). This means that the general diagonalizing matrix U in\nEq. (3.2) now takes the form\nU = R\u03c9,\n1\n\n1\n\n(4.1)\n1\n\nwhere \u03c9ab = \u03b4ab \u03b7b2 with \u03b7b2 = 1 for a positive eigenvalue and \u03b7b2 = i for a negative eigenvalue.\nWe notice that Eq. (4.1) is of the form Eq. (3.12) for which we already noticed that the\nfactor \u03c9 cancels out in the neutrino oscillation formula Eq. (3.14). Furthermore only the\nsquare of the mass is relevant in Eq. (3.14). Thus we choose to work in this section with\nsome negative masses and no factor \u03c9 in Eq. (4.1).\nTo avoid confusion, we remark that the factor \u03c9 in Eq. (4.1) does not introduce any CP\nviolation in the theory [29] since M\u03bd is real in any event.\nNow let us suppose that an experimental analysis of all neutrino oscillation experiments is\nmade based on a formula like Eq. (3.14) (or one which treats the experimental uncertainties\nin a more sophisticated way). Furthermore assume that the CP violating phase \u03c613 in Eq.\n(3.12) is negligible. Then we should know the magnitudes of the squared neutrino mass\ndifferences\n(m2 )2 \u2212 (m1 )2 = A,\n\n(m3 )2 \u2212 (m2 )2 = B,\n\n(4.2)\n\nwhere A and B can be either positive or negative. Then, assuming the leptonic theory to\nbe CP conserving, our Ansatz would imply\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n0 = Tr (M\u03bd ) = Tr RM\u0302 RT = m1 + m2 + m3 ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwhere Eq. (3.2) was used. Eqs. (4.2) and (4.3) comprise three equations for the three\nneutrino masses m1 , m2 and m3 . We can solve to get:\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n2 \u221a 2\nB\n2\n2\n(m1 ) =\nA + B + AB \u2212 A +\n,\n3\n2\nB \u2212 (m1 )2\n,\nm2 =\n2m1\nm3 = \u2212m1 \u2212 m2 .\n6\n\n(4.4)\n\n\fThis leads to a limited number of solutions, depending on sign choices.\nIf we make the further assumption that the charged lepton mixing matrix \u03a9 in Eq.\n(3.4) is approximately the unit matrix (this is expected to be a reasonable but not perfect\napproximation) we can identify R \u2248 K which would be obtained from experiment. Then,\n\nusing the masses found in Eq. (4.4), we could reconstruct M\u03bd as\nM\u03bd \u2248 RM\u0302 RT .\n\n(4.5)\n\nTo proceed, we need only insert the experimental results for A, B and K in (4.4) and\n(4.5). Of course, it is presumably the task of the next decade to solidify the experimental\ndetermination of these quantities. We can, at the moment, only give a preliminary discussion.\nFor this purpose we will use the results of a recent preliminary analysis of all neutrino\nexperiments by Ohlsson and Snellman [30]. These authors found, by a least square analysis,\na best fit for (our notation) |A|, |B| and the leptonic mixing matrix K. They used the\nformula Eq. (3.14) with a suitable choice of b0 and \u03c3b2 for each experiment. Furthermore,\n\nthey made the simplifying assumption that K is real. Finally they only searched for a fit in\nthe range 10\u22124 eV2 \u2264 |A| \u2264 10\u22123 eV2 , 0.2 eV2 \u2264 |B| \u2264 2 eV2 . This range corresponds to\n\nmass difference choices for which the MSW effect [31] for solar and atmospheric neutrinos\n\nis not expected to be important and so greatly simplifies the analysis. Thus there is no\nguarantee that the solution of [30] is unique. Altogether they fit sixteen different solar\nneutrino, atmospheric neutrino, accelerator and reactor experiments, including LSND. The\nbest fit is:\n|A| = 2.87 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV2 ,\n\n|B| = 1.11 eV2 ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nfor the squared mass differences and\n\uf8ee\n\n0.7052\n\n0.7052 0.0732\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef \u22120.6441 0.5940 0.4820 \uf8fa\nKexp = \uf8ef\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n0.2964 \u22120.3871 0.8731\n\n(4.7)\n\nfor the lepton mixing matrix K. As discussed above we will identify K \u2248 R here, keeping\n\nK real but allowing for negative masses. The best fit matrix K was obtained to be similar\nbut not identical to the \"bimaximal mixing\" matrix [32].\nWith the best fit squared mass differences in Eq. (4.6), our model predicts, from the\nfirst of Eq. (4.4), eight different possibilities. These correspond to four different sign configurations for A and B times the two possible signs for m1 . However, only two of these eight\nare essentially different; these are\n7\n\n\ftype I :\ntype II :\n\nm1 = 0.6082 eV,\n\nm2 = 0.6084 eV,\n\nm1 = 1.053701 eV,\n\nm3 = \u22121.2166 eV\n\nm2 = \u22121.053565 eV,\n\nm3 = \u22120.000136 eV\n\n(4.8)\n(4.9)\n\nThe other solutions correspond to interchanging whichever of |m1 | and |m2 | is greater (which\n\nhas only a negligible effect since they are almost degenerate) or reversing the signs of all\nmasses. Physically it is clear what is happening: the smallness of |A| compared to |B| in\nEq. (4.2) forces |m1 | \u2248 |m2 |. Then we have either m1 \u2248 m2 with, using the constraint Eq.\n\n(4.3), m3 \u2248 \u22122m1 or m1 \u2248 \u2212m2 with m3 very small.\n\nSince we have assumed the neutrinos to be of Majorana type for our plausibility argu-\n\nment in section II, their interactions will violate lepton number. Then they should mediate\nneutrinoless double beta decay (\u03b2\u03b20\u03bd ) [33]. Such a process has not yet been observed and\nan upper bound has been set for the relevant quantity\nhm\u03bd i \u2261\n\n3\nX\n\n(K1\u03b1 )2 m\u03b1 .\n\n(4.10)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nThe best upper bound at present is [34] hm\u03bd i \u2264 0.2 \u2212 0.6 eV, reflecting some uncertainty in\n\nthe estimation of the needed nuclear matrix elements.\n\nSubstituting the best fit for the matrix K from Eq. (4.7) together with our results in\nEqs. (4.8) and (4.9) into Eq. (4.10) yields predictions for the two cases:\ntype I :\ntype II :\n\nhm\u03bd i = 0.60 eV,\n\n(4.11)\n\nhm\u03bd i = 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 eV.\n\n(4.12)\n\nBoth solutions seem to be acceptable, the type I case marginally but the type II case\ndefinitely. Note that the small value for hm\u03bd i in the type II case is due to the best fit\nprediction [30] K11 = K12 and also to the fact that m2 is negative. The same value would\n\nclearly result if we made m2 positive and set K12 = 0.7052i as discussed around Eq. (4.1)\nabove.\nFinally, let us reconstruct the underlying neutrino mass matrices for each of the two\ncases. We use Eq. (4.5) based on the assumption that M\u03bd is real and also our ansatz to find\n(in units of eV):\n\ntype I :\n\ntype II :\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0.5985 \u22120.0643 \u22120.1167\n\n\uf8ee\n\n6.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u22120.9199 0.5078\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\nM\u03bd = M\u03bdT \u2248 \uf8ef \u22120.0643 0.1843 \u22120.7680 \uf8fa ,\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n\u22120.1167 \u22120.7680 \u22120.7828\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\nM\u03bd = M\u03bdT \u2248 \uf8ef \u22120.9199\n\uf8f0\n0.5078\n8\n\n0.0654\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n.\n0.0410 \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n0.0410 \u22120.0654\n\n(4.13)\n\n(4.14)\n\n\fThe type I matrix does not have an excellent candidate for a \"texture\" zero. However the\nsmall value of (M\u03bd )11 in the type II case is certainly suggestive. These matrices lead to\nneutrino masses and a mixing matrix which give a best fit to all present data. It will be\ninteresting to see if either of them hold up in the future.\nIncidentally, on comparing Eqs. (4.13) and (4.14) it is amusing to observe the large\ndifference in two mass matrices \"generated\" in the same way except with respect to how\nTr (M\u03bd ) = 0 is satisfied.\n\nV. CASE OF COMPLEX M\u03bd\n\nIt seems interesting to also investigate the Ansatz Tr(M\u03bd ) = 0 when M\u03bd is no longer\nrestricted to be real. This also raises the problem of constructing the unitary diagonalizing matrix U in Eq.(3.2), in terms of the experimentally measured lepton mixing matrix\nKexp . For simplicity, as before, we will make the approximation that the charged lepton\ndiagonalizing matrix \u03a9 is the unit matrix.\nApart from an overall (conventional) phase we may write\nU = \u03c90 (\u03c3)Kexp \u03c90\u22121 (\u03c4 ),\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the 2-parameter quantity \u03c90 was defined in Eq. (3.8). Since Kexp has four parameters\nU in Eq. (5.1) is described by eight parameters. As mentioned before, the two parameters\nin \u03c90\u22121 (\u03c4 ) are not measurable in neutrino oscillation experiments but show up when one considers (\u03b2\u03b2)o\u03bd . The two parameters in \u03c90 (\u03c3) may be eliminated, for experimental purposes,\nby rephasing the charged leptons. However, for the theoretical purpose of reconstructing\nthe underlying neutrino mass matrix M\u03bd , their existence cannot be ruled out. (They also\ndo not contribute to (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd .)\nFor the purpose of relating the Ansatz on M\u03bd to the physical neutrino masses in M\u0302 , we\nnote\n\u22121 \u22121\n\u2217\nTr(M\u03bd ) = Tr(Kexp\n\u03c90 (2\u03c3)Kexp\n\u03c90 (2\u03c4 )M\u0302 ).\n\n(5.2)\n\nFor further simplicity of the analysis we adopt the special case \u03c90 (2\u03c3) = 1 and also\nidentify Kexp with the real best fit in Eq. (4.7); our Ansatz now reads\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n0 = Tr(M\u03bd ) = Tr \u03c90 (2\u03c4 )M\u0302 .\nWith the redefinitions \u03b21 = 4\u03c41 + 2\u03c42 and \u03b22 = 2\u03c41 + 4\u03c42 , Eq. (5.3) becomes\n9\n\n(5.3)\n\n\f\u03b2\n\n2\n\nm\n\nm\n\n1\n\n2\n\u03b21\nm\n\n3\nFIG. 1. Geometrical picture of Eq. (5.4).\n\nei\u03b21 m1 + ei\u03b22 m2 + m3 = 0\n\n(5.4)\n\nThis may be conveniently visualized as the vector triangle shown in Fig. 1.\nCombining Eqs. (5.4) and (4.2) gives four real equations for the five unknown quantities\n(m1 , m2 , m3 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 ). Thus we have (for each set of (A, B) sign choices) a one parameter\nfamily of solutions. It is convenient to choose this parameter to be m3 . Then m1 and m2\nmay be found from the equations (4.2), provided that solutions exist. In this way all three\nsides of the triangle in Fig.1 are determined. The angles may finally be found as\nm21 \u2212 m22 \u2212 m23\n2m2 m3\nm2\nsin\u03b21 = \u2212 sin\u03b22 .\nm1\n\ncos\u03b22 =\n\n(5.5)\n\nWe also need to investigate the constraint arising from the non-observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd .\nEq. (4.10) now becomes, with Eq. (5.1) as the mixing matrix\nhm\u03bd i = m1 (Kexp\n\n11 )\n\n2 \u2212i\u03b21\n\ne\n\n+ m2 (Kexp\n\n12 )\n\n2 \u2212i\u03b22\n\ne\n\n+ m3 (Kexp\n\n13 )\n\n2\n\n.\n\n(5.6)\n\ni\n\n(5.7)\n\nUsing the Ansatz constraint Eq. (5.4), Eq. (5.6) may be rewritten as\nh\n\nhm\u03bd i = (Kexp\n\n2\n12 ) \u2212 (Kexp\n\ni\n\nh\n\n\u2212i\u03b22\n2\n+ (Kexp\n11 ) m2 e\n\n2\n13 ) \u2212 (Kexp\n\n2\n11 ) m3 .\n\nThis form is very convenient when identifying Kexp with the best fit solution in Eq. (4.7). In\nthe present context such an identification corresponds to CP violation for the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd process\nbut not for usual neutrino oscillations. Since the (11) and (12) matrix elements are equal in\nEq. (4.7) we find the simple result\n10\n\n\fhm\u03bd i = 0.49m3 .\n\n(5.8)\n\nThus if the upper bound on hm\u03bd i is conservatively identified as in the 0.2 \u2212 0.6 eV range,\n\nwe should have in this case\n\nm3 \u2264 0.41 \u2212 1.22eV.\n\n(5.9)\n\nIn the present complex case there is a continuum of possible solutions labelled by those\nvalues of m3 satisfying Eq. (5.9), rather than just the two possibilities found in Eq. (4.8)\nand Eq. (4.9). Actually, the continuum separates roughly into two classes similar to either\nEq. (4.8) or Eq. (4.9). In the generalized type I class, m3 is of the order B = 1.11 eV while\nm1 and m2 are related to nearly oppositely directed vectors in Fig. 1 and are also of the\norder B. In the generalized type II class, B is negative; m1 and m2 correspond to vectors of\norder |B| which are oppositely directed to each other, while m3 ranges from very small to\norder |B|.\n\nGiven the bound Eq. (5.9) from the non-observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)o\u03bd , there are important\n\nlimitations on the allowed m3 values for type I solutions. In this case B is positive so the\nequation\n(m2 )2 = (m3 )2 \u2212 B = (m3 )2 \u2212 (1.11 eV)2 ,\n\n(5.10)\n\nwill only allow solutions for m3 > 1.11 eV. This range is barely compatible with Eq. (5.9).\nThus the type II case where B < 0 and m1 \u2248 m2 > m3 seems most probable.\n\nAs an example of a solution for complex M\u03bd , consider choosing m3 = 0.2 eV. Then a\n\nsolution is obtained with (compare with Fig. 1)\nm1 \u2248 m2 \u2248 1.128 eV, m3 = 0.2 eV, \u03b21 \u2248 95.1o , \u03b22 \u2248 264.9o .\n\n(5.11)\n\nThe matrix U, which diagonalizes M\u03bd is obtained from Eq. (5.1), with the approximation\n\u03c90 (\u03c3) = 1, and with now:\n\u03c90\u22121 (\u03c4 ) = diag(0.976 + 0.216i, 0.301 \u2212 0.953i, 0.500 + 0.866i)\n\n(5.12)\n\nThis factor introduces CP violation in the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd process but not in ordinary neutrino\noscillations.\nFinally the underlying neutrino mass matrix, U M\u0302 U T is \"reconstructed\" as (in units of\neV):\n\uf8ee\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\nM\u03bd = M\u03bdT = \uf8ef\n\n0.049 \u2212 0.085i \u22120.855 \u2212 0.481i 0.459 + 0.287i\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\n.\n0.076 + 0.009i \u22120.025 + 0.131i \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\u22120.125 + 0.077i\n\n11\n\n(5.13)\n\n\fThis is structurally similar to the real type II solution displayed in Eq. (4.14), although the\nsuppression of the (11) element is not so pronounced. Notice that m3 is considerably smaller\nthan the almost degenerate pair m1 and m2 . Furthermore m1 and m2 are large enough to\npossibly play some role in astrophysics.\n\nVI. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe investigated the Ansatz Tr (M\u03bd ) = 0 for the underlying (pre-diagonal) three generation neutrino mass matrix. It was motivated by noting that in an SO(10) grand unified\nmodel where M\u03bd was taken to be real (CP conserving), it corresponds to the well known\nunification of b quark and \u03c4 lepton masses. While not very predictive by itself it yields\ninformation complementary to what would be gotten from a complete three flavor analysis\nof all lepton number conserving neutrino oscillation experiments. Specifically from the specification of the magnitudes of two neutrino squared mass differences and also of the leptonic\nmixing matrix we can, with some assumptions, find the neutrino masses themselves and\n\"reconstruct\" M\u03bd . This determination can be sharpened by consideration of the constraints\nimposed by non-observation of neutrinoless double beta decay.\nFor the purpose of testing our Ansatz we employed the results of a reasonable best fit to\nall present neutrino experiments (including LSND) by Ohlsson and Snellmann [30]. This fit\nwill inevitably be improved in the next few years as new experiments are completed. They\nwere able to fit the data without assuming any CP violation. This agrees with assuming\nM\u03bd to be real. We found two essentially different solutions in that case. The first features\ntwo neutrinos having approximately equal mass 0.608 eV and a third neutrino of mass 1.217\neV. This solution is on the borderline of being ruled out by non-observation of (\u03b2\u03b2 0\u03bd ). The\nsecond solution has two neutrinos with approximately degenerate mass 1.054 eV and a third\nneutrino with a mass 1.36\u00d710\u22124 eV. This solution is very safe from being ruled out by (\u03b2\u03b2 0\u03bd )\nexperiments. It also features a reconstructed M\u03bd which has an extremely small (11) element.\nNote that, for both solutions, even though M\u03bd is real there are some (CP conserving) factors\nof i in the mixing matrix when all masses are taken to be positive. Alternatively one may\nhave no i's in the mixing matrix while allowing some masses to be negative. The latter form\nis useful for seeing intuitively how Tr(M\u03bd )=0 is possible.\nThe case of matching the above best fit data to a complex M\u03bd was also considered. In this\nsituation there are CP violating phases in the lepton mixing matrix which affect the (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd\nprocess but do not affect ordinary total lepton number conserving neutrino oscillations.\nSuch phases could also be measurable in principle with the observation of a decay like \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192\n12\n\n\f\u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bc+ . The case of complex M\u03bd allows a larger number of solutions. With a simplifying\nassumption there is a one parameter family of allowed neutrino mass sets. Roughly, these\nfall into one of the two types already encountered for real M\u03bd .\nA question of some interest is whether the neutrinos are massive enough to play a role\nin cosmology. The relevant criterion [35] for this to occur is usually stated as\n\na ma\n\nP\n\n> 6 eV.\n\nFor the type II solutions with complex M\u03bd we have found the largest mass sum to be about\n4.5 eV corresponding to m1 \u2248 m2 = 1.62 eV and m3 \u2248 1.22 eV. However this is on the very\nborder of acceptability for non observation of (\u03b2\u03b2)0\u03bd .\n\nFuture best fits to the neutrino oscillation data can easily be accommodated in the\npresent framework. Of course, the predictions for neutrino masses and mixings will depend\non this input.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe would like to thank H. Benaoum for useful comments on the manuscript.
