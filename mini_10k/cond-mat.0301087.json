With the variation of the coefficient of restitution, the mass ratio\nbetween two spheres or the box size, we show that two types of segregated states and\ncrossover between them are realized in such a small simple system. PACS number(s):\n\nGranular materials exhibit various complex phenomena1,2 . Examples are segregations\nof particles mixtures with different properties which appear by shaking or stirring them, or\nconfined them in a horizontally rotating drum, and so on3\u201318 . Recently, many studies for\nseveral segregated patterns and the crossover between them are reported10\u201318 .\nIn this paper, instead of carrying out simulations with many particles, we choose a simple\nsystem consisting of inelastic hard spheres with different masses. Although the system is\nso simple, it will be shown to exhibit segregation of particles. This system is expected as a\nsimple model of local processes of highly excited granular mixtures.\nSuch small systems with elastic hard discs are recently investigated, and are found to show\na prototype of solid-liquid phase transition, glass transition, and the transition between the\nstatic and dynamic friction19\u201321 . In the following, we show that this simple system realizes\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\nawa@complex.c.u-tokyo.ac.jp\n\n1\n\n\fthe crossover between two segregated states like the change between different segregated\npatterns obtained in recent studies10\u201318 .\nThe system under consideration consists of two inelastic hard sphere particles with unit\nradius and different masses which are confined in a two-dimensional square box (Fig. 1).\nThe left-hand wall is set at the origin of the horizontal axis and is in contact with the energy\nsource. All walls are rigid and have a length larger than 4. The interaction between a\nparticle and the walls without an energy source occurs only through hard-core collisions.\nWe give the position of a light and a heavy particle in the horizontal direction xL and xH\nas the distance from the left wall, and the mass mL = 1 and mH = M > 1. The interaction\nbetween two particles occur through inelastic hard-core collisions with the the coefficient of\nrestitution e. A particle hitting the left-hand wall in contact with the energy source with\nthe velocity (vh , vv ) bounces back with the velocity (Vh , Vv ) (Vh > 0). Here, subscripts h\nand v indicate, respectively, the horizontal and vertical directions. In this paper, we employ\na heat bath of the temperature T as the energy source because of the simplicity. Then, the\nvelocity (Vh , Vv ) is chosen randomly from the probability distributions Ph (Vh ) and Pv (Vv )22 :\nPh (Vh ) =\n\nmi Vh2\nmi Vh\nexp(\u2212\n)\nT\n2T\n\n(1)\n\nmi 1\nmi Vv2\n) 2 exp(\u2212\n),\n2\u03c0T\n2T\n\n(2)\n\nPv (Vv ) = (\n\nwhere T is the temperature of the heat bath fixed as unity. (We give the Boltzmann constant\nas 1.)\nIn the following, we perform the simulation of the above system with the length of walls\nS is = 4.05, = 4.2, and = 4.5. For this range of S, particles are densely packed and the\ncollision between particles occur frequently. Now, in order to characterize the distribution\nof two particles, we define the segregation parameter \u03b4 \u2261< xL \u2212 xH >t where <>t means\nthe time average. If \u03b4 \u223c 0, the particles are not segregated while the sign of \u03b4 gives the\naverage configuration of the two particles.\nNow, we draw the phase diagram of the model against {M, e} (M > 1 and e < 1),\naccording to the size of S. Figure 2 shows the diagram for (a) S = 4.05, (b) S = 4.2 and (c)\n2\n\n\fS = 4.5. Here, \u03b4 > 0 holds in the region with +, \u03b4 < 0 holds in the region with \u2212, and \u03b4 \u223c 0\nholds in the shadow area drawn by multiple of points. (In this paper, we regard the case\nwith \u2212(S \u2212 d) \u00d7 10\u22123 < \u03b4 < (S \u2212 d) \u00d7 10\u22123 as \u03b4 \u223c 0 where d is the diameter of the particle.)\nIndependently of S, each phase diagram has following characteristics. For small M, \u03b4 \u223c 0\nor \u03b4 > 0 holds over all the range of e < 1. When M is increased, the system realizes two\nstates with \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b4 < 0 and the crossover between them depends on e. In particular,\ncritical value e to realize the crossover between states with \u03b4 < 0 and \u03b4 > 0 is independent\nof M for large limit of M. However, crossover points shift to larger e and larger M with the\nincrease of S. This means the change of the packing fraction of particles is also relevant to\nthe crossover between \u03b4 < 0 and \u03b4 > 0 states. Moreover, the crossover points for S = 4.05\nform a curve with 'N' shape, while the curve becomes smooth with the increase of S like in\nFig. 2 (b) and (c).\nFigure 3 (a) shows \u03b4 as a function of e foe M = 1.5, M = 2.0, M = 3.65 and M = 6.0\nwith S = 4.05. For large M, \u03b4 takes a minimum value at about e \u223c 0.825 and the minimum\nvalue decreases with the increase of M. In Fig. 3 (b), \u03b4 is plotted as a function of M for\ne = 0.825, e = 0.625 and e = 0.55. Here, \u03b4 has a peak at M \u223c 1.3. With the decrease of e,\n\u03b4 for larger M becomes larger than that for M at the peak.\nTo expalin the existence of the two segregated states with \u03b4 > 0 and \u03b4 < 0, we consider\ntwo effects determining the sign of \u03b4, respectively; One effect contributes to the increase of\n\u03b4 and the other contributes to the decrease of \u03b4 with the decrease of e.\nFirst, we study the former effect. The light particle's velocity just after the contact with\nthe energy source on the left-hand wall tends to be faster than the heavy particle's because\nthese velocities are a decrease function of the mass of each particle.On the other hand, by\niterations of the collision between two particles, their velocities approach with each other\nbecause e < 1. This implies that the light particle tends to be located farther from the\nleft-hand wall than to the heavy particle. Thus, \u03b4 is expected to increase with the decrease\nof e. The contribution of this effect is expected to increase with 1 \u2212 e, and as a rough\napproximation, it is assumed to be proportional to 1 \u2212 e.\n3\n\n\fSecond, we study the effect by which \u03b4 is decreased with the decrease of e. If e is given\na value close to 1, the approach of two particles' velocities is slow. Then if M >> 1, the\nlight particle moves much faster than the heavy one for most of the time and the collision\nbetween two particles occurs frequently. Then, the light particle behaves like a potential\nbarrier for the motion of the heavy particle. In this case, the heavy particle's motion to\ngo accross this potential barrier is important to determine the particle distribution. The\nkinetic energy of the heavy particle with the case of xL < xH is smaller than that of xL > xH\nbecause, in the former case, the heavy particle can not make a contact with the heat bath\ndirectly and the energy is supplied only by collisions with the light particle. This means\nthat the mean velocity of the heavy particle of the case xL < xH is smaller than that of\nxL > xH , while the ratio between velocities is roughly estimated to be e : 1. Then, the ratio\nbetween the time required to switch from xL < xH to xL > xH and that to switch from\nxL > xH to xL < xH is given as 1 : e. Here, this effect on \u03b4 is prominent only for the case\nwith the large collision frequency which is almost propotional to e. In addition, this collision\nfrequency increases with the decrease of S. Then, the contribution from the above effect is\napproximately estimated as \u03b41 \u223c (e \u2212 1)e/C(S) (C is an increase function of S.).\nBy the combination of these effects, \u03b4 for large M is given as \u03b4 \u223c A\u03b40 +B\u03b41 = (1\u2212e)(A\u2212\nB\ne).\nC(S)\n\nHere, A and B are given as positive constant values. With adequate A, B, and C\n\nholding 0 < AC(S)/B < 1, \u03b4 takes a negative value for large e (1 > e > AC(S)/B) and a\npositive value for small e (0 < e < AC(S)/B). This result also gives that the crossover value\nof e between the state with \u03b4 < 0 and that with \u03b4 > 0 becomes larger with the increase of\nS. If M is small, the contribution of \u03b41 is expected little. Thus, \u03b4 > 0 is realized for small\nM.\nIn this paper, the mass segregation and the phase inversion are investigated through a\nsystem which consists of only two inelastic hard spheres in a square box with heat bath.\nWith the variation of the coefficient of restitution, the mass ratio or the box size, two types\nof states with different particle distributions and crossover between them are observed for\nthe case with a large mass ratio between two particles. The system we studied here may\n4\n\n\flook too small and simple. However, we expect that this system can describe local dynamics\nof highly excited granular systems, and provide a basis for the understanding of particle\nsegregations in granular system consisting of many particles.\nThe effects of the gravity, the size differences and the friction should be considered in\norder to investigate the generality of obtained phenomena like the crossover between different segregated states10\u201318 . Further analytical study of this system to clarify the presented\nbehavior as well as the study of systems with three or more particles are necessary in future.\nThe author is grateful to K.Kaneko, M.
