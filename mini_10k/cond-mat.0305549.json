The structure is\ncalled scale-free (SF) network, which exhibits a powerlaw degree distribution P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 , 2 < \u03b3 < 3, for the\nprobability of k connections. The topology deviates from\nthe conventional homogeneous regular lattices and random graphs. Many researchers are attracted to a new\nparadigm of the heterogeneous SF networks in the active\nand fruitful area.\nThe structure of SF networks also gives us a strong\nimpact on the dynamics of epidemic models for computer viruses, HIV, and others. Recently, it has been\nshown [19] that a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)\nmodel on SF networks has no epidemic threshold; infections can be proliferated, whatever small infection rate\nthey have. This result disproves the threshold theory\nin epidemiology [22]. The heterogeneous structure is\nalso crucial for spreading the viruses on the analysis of\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models [14][17]. In\ncontrast to the absence of epidemic threshold, an immunization strategy has been theoretically presented in\nSIS models [7][21]. The targeted immunization applies\nthe extreme disconnections by attacks against hubs with\nhigh-degrees on SF networks [1] to a prevention against\nthe spread of infections.\nIn this paper, we investigate the dynamic properties\nfor spreading of computer viruses on the SF networks\nestimated from real data of e-mail communication [15].\nAs a new property in both simulation and theoretical\nanalysis, we suggest a growing network with new e-mail\nusers causes the recoverable prevalence from a temporary silence of almost complete extinction. The typical\nphenomenon in observations [11][23] is not explained by\nthe above statistical analysises at steady states or meanvalues (in the fixed size or N \u2192 \u221e). We first consider,\nin simulations, a realistic growing model with the proba-\n\nbilistic execution and detection of viruses on the SF network. Then, for understanding the mechanisms of recoverable prevalence and extinction, we analyze simpler\ngrowing models in deterministic equations. By using a\nmean-field approximation without the connectivity correlations, we derive bifurcation conditions from the extinction to the recoverable prevalence (or the opposite),\nwhich is related to the growth, infection, and immune\nrates. Moreover, we verify the effectiveness of the targeted immunization by anti-viruses for hubs even in the\ngrowing system.\n\nII.\n\nA.\n\nE-MAIL NETWORK\n\nThe state transition for infection\n\nWe consider a network whose vertices and edges represent computers and the communication via e-mails between users. The state at each computer i = 1, . . . , N is\nchanged from the susceptible, hidden, infectious, and to\nthe recovered by the remove of viruses and installation\nof anti-viruses. We make a realistic model in stochastic\nstate transitions with probabilities of the execution and\nthe detection of viruses. Fig. 1 shows the state transitions, where \u03bb and \u03b4 denote the execution rate from\nthe hidden to the infectious state and the detection rate\nfrom the special subjects or doubtful attachment files.\nThe probability at least one detection from the ni viruses\non the computer is 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)ni , and the probability at\nleast one execution is 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb)ni . We assume the infected mail is not sent again for the same communication\npartner (sent it at only one time) to be difficult for the\ndetection. Thus, ni is at most the number of in-degree\nat each vertex. In the stochastic SHIR model, the final\nstate is the recovered or immune by anti-viruses, if at\nleast one infected mail is received.\n\n\f2\ndetection from\nreceive-mails\n\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) n i\n\npropagation by sent-mails\nreceive-mails\n\n.\n.\n.\n\n. . .\n\nSusceptible\n\nHidden infected\n\nInfectious\n\nRecovered\n(Immune)\n\nexecution\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4)n i\n\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb) n i\n\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) n i\n\ndetection by\ninfected diseases\n\ndetection befor the infections\nin the latents 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) n i\n\nFIG. 1: S-H-I-R state transition diagram.\n\nthe average number of mails par day k\u0304 = 5 \u223c 20.

In addition, the cumulative histograms of\nless than degree k in Fig. 3 (a) have similar shapes to\nthem in a larger network of e-mail address books [18].\nThe solid lines in Fig. 3 correspond to non-cumulative\ndistributions of the in-degree and out-degree estimated\nas stretched exponential\n(a) Pin (k) \u223c k \u22121.97 \u00d7 exp(\u221272.26 \u00d7 k \u2212316.23), Pout (k) \u223c\nk \u22122.29 \u00d7 exp(\u221256.98 \u00d7 k \u2212247.39 ),\n(b) Pin (k) \u223c k \u22121.82 \u00d7 exp(0.63 \u00d7 k \u221252.99 ), Pout (k) \u223c\nk \u22122.02 \u00d7 exp(0.6 \u00d7 k \u221259.23 ),\n(c) Pin (k) \u223c k \u22121.75 \u00d7 exp(\u22120.71 \u00d7 k \u221253.42 ), Pout (k) \u223c\nk \u22121.39 \u00d7 exp(\u22121.43 \u00d7 k \u2212137.95 ),\n(d) Pin (k) \u223c k \u22122.87 \u00d7 exp(3.54 \u00d7 k \u22120.048 ), Pout (k) \u223c\nk \u22122.49 \u00d7 exp(3.23 \u00d7 k \u22120.002 ).\n\n(a)\n\nIn all of them, the factor of power law as a scale-free\nnetwork is dominant. Note that the in-degree distribution in Fig. 3 (d) is the most close to the exponential\ndistribution in [18] with a strong cut-off, and that both\ndata consists of only the internal networks. However, as\nin [6] [18], we must further discuss about the reason why\nexponential in-degree distribution appears in only the internal networks. This is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe non-exponential distributions may be caused by the\nlimited size of the sample, or by that the eliminated links\nfrom the external nodes have an impact on the generation\nof hubs in a scale-free network.\n\nC.\n\n(b)\nFIG. 2: Power-law degree distributions with the exponents\n\u03b3out = 2.5 and \u03b3in = 1.9 for (a) sent-mails and (b) receivemails between users including the internal and the external\n[15] . The frequency at degree k is counted in the interval\nbetween [k, k + 10], except of the outer of more than 100\ndegree at k = 200.\n\nB.\n\nThe scale-free structure\n\nWe show the network structure based on real data measured by questionnaires for 2,555 users in a part of World\nInternet Project 2000 [15]. The distributions of both\nsent- and receive-mails follow a power-law in Fig. 2, the\nparameters are estimated as \u03b3out = 2.5, \u03b3in = 1.9, and\n\nThe (\u03b1, \u03b2) model\n\nWith the estimated parameters, we generate a SF network for the contact relations between e-mail users, by\napplying the simple (\u03b1, \u03b2) model [13], in which the slopes\n1\n1\nand \u03b3out \u2248 1\u2212\u03b2\nare controlled by\nof power-law \u03b3in \u2248 1\u2212\u03b1\nthe \u03b1-\u03b2 coin in Table I (in the case of e-mails \u03b1 = 0.4736\nand \u03b2 = 0.6). Growing with a new vertex at each step,\nk edges are added as follows. As the terminal, the coin\nchooses a new vertex with probability \u03b1 and an old vertex\nwith probability 1 \u2212 \u03b1 in proportion to its in-degree. As\nthe origin, the coin chooses a new vertex with probability\n\u03b2 and an old vertex with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b2 in proportion\nto its out-degree. According to both the growth and the\npreferential attachment [3][4], the generation processes\nare repeated until the required size N is obtained as a\nconnected component without self-loops and multi-edges.\nThe (\u03b1, \u03b2) model generates both of edges from/to a new\nvertex and edges between old vertices, the processes are\nsomewhat analogous to ones in the generalized BA model\n[2][3].\n\n\f3\n2\n\nprobability\n\u03b1\n1\u2212\u03b1\n\u03b2\nself-loop at new vertex origin: new, terminal: old\n1\u2212\u03b2\nterminal: new, origin: old\nboth of old vertices\n\nCumlative Distribution\n\n10\n\nTABLE I: Directed edge generation by the \u03b1-\u03b2 coin.\n\n1\n\n10\n\nIII.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 0\n\nIn\u2212degree\n\n50\n\n(a)\n5\n\n10\n\nCumlative Distribution\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 0\n\nIn\u2212degree\n\n50\n\n100\n\nOut\u2212degree\n\n(b)\n\n4\n\nCumlative Distribution\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 0\n\nIn\u2212degree\n\n50\n\n100\n\nOut\u2212degree\n\n(c)\n\n3\n\nCumlative Distribution\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\n5\n\nSIMULATIONS FOR STOCHASTIC MODEL\n\n100\n\nOut\u2212degree\n\n0\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\nOut\u2212degree\n\nIn\u2212degree\n\n(d)\nFIG. 3: The cumulative distributions of the in-degree and\nout-degree for e-mail networks.

In the following simulations, we set the\nexecution rate \u03bb = 0.1, the detection rate \u03b4 = 0.04, the\naverage number of edges k\u0304 = 6.6, and initial infection\nsources of randomly chosen five vertices (the following\nresults are similar to other small values \u03bb = 0.2, 0.3 and\n\u03b4 = 0.05, 0.06). These small values are realistic, because\ncomputer viruses are not recognized before the prevalence and it may be executed by some users. We note\nthe parameters are related to the sharpness of increasing/decreasing infections up/down (\u03b4 is more sensitive).\nIt is well known, in a closed system of the SHIR model,\nthe number of infected computers (the hidden and infectious states) is initially increased and saturated, finally converged to zero as the extinction. While the pattern may be different in an open system, indeed, oscillations have been described by a deterministic KermackMcKendrik model [22]. However a constant population\n(equal rates of the birth and the death) or territorial\ncompetition has been mainly discussed in the model, the\ngrowth of computer network is obviously more rapid,\nand the communications in mailing are not competitive.\nThus, we consider a growing system, in which 50 vertices\nand the corresponded new k\u0304 edges are added at every\nstep, from an initial SF network with N = 400 up to\n20350 at 400 steps. Here, one step is corresponding to a\nday (400 steps \u2248 a year). These values of \u03bb, \u03b4, k\u0304, and\nthe growth rate are only examples with something of reality for simulations, since the actual values depends on\nthe observed period are still unknown. As shown in Fig.\n4(a)(b), the phenomena of persistent recoverable prevalence are found in the open system, but not in the closed\nsystem.\nTo prevent the wide spread of infections, we investigate\nhow to assign anti-virus softwares onto the SF networks.\nWe verify the effectiveness of the targeted immunization\nfor hubs even in the cases of recoverable prevalence. Fig.\n4(c)(d) show the average number of infected computers\nwith recoverable prevalence in 100 trials, where immunized vertices are randomly selected or as hubs according to the out-degree order of the 10 %, 20 %, 30 % of\ngrowing size at every 30 steps (corresponded to a month).\nThe number is decreased as larger immune rates for hubs,\nviruses are nearly extinct (there exists only few viruses)\nin the 30 % as marked by \u00d7 in Fig. 4(c). While it is\nalso decreased as larger immune rates for randomly selected vertices, however they are not extinct even in the\n\n\f4\n30 % as marked by \u00d7 in Fig. 4(d). Fig. 5(a)(b) show the\nnumber of recovered states by the hub and random immunization of the 30 % (triangle marks) for the comparison\nwith the normal detections (rectangle marks). The immunized hubs are dominant than the normal detections\nin Fig. 5(a). However, there is no such difference for the\nrandom immunization in Fig. 5(b). In the case of the 10\n%, the relation is exchanged; the number of detections\nis larger than that of both hub and random immunization. It is the intermediate in the case of the 20 %. From\nthese results, we remark the targeted immunization for\nhubs strongly prevents the spread of infections in spite\nof the totally fewer recovered states than that in random\nimmunization.\nIV.\n\n(a)\n\nANALYSIS FOR DETERMINISTIC MODEL\n\nAlthough the stochastic SHIR model is realistic, the\nanalysis is very difficult in the open system. Thus, we\nanalyze simpler deterministic SIR models for the spreading of computer viruses to understand the mechanisms of\nrecoverable prevalence and extinction by the immunization. We consider the time evolutions of S(t) > 0 and\nI(t) > 0 (t \u2265 0), which are the number of susceptible and\ninfected vertices. We assume that infection sources exist\nin an initial network, and that both network growth and\nthe spread of viruses are progressed in continuous time\nas an approximation. In addition, we have no specific\nrules in growing, but consider a linearly growing network\nsize and the distribution of connections on an undirected\nconnected graph as a consequence.\nA.\n\n(b)\n\nHomogeneous SIR model\n\nAs the most simple case, in the homogeneous networks\nwith only the detection of viruses, the time evolutions are\ngiven by\ndS(t)\n= \u2212b < k > S(t)I(t) + a,\n(1)\ndt\ndI(t)\n= \u2212\u03b40 I(t) + b < k > S(t)I(t),\n(2)\ndt\nwhere a > 0 and 0 < b, \u03b40 < 1 denote the growth,\ndef\ninfection, and detection rates, respectively. < k > =\nP\nk kP (k) is the average number of connections with a\nprobability P (k). The term S(t)I(t) represents the frequency of contact relations. Note that the number of\nrecovered vertices R(t) is a shadow variable defined by\ndR(t)\n= \u03b40 I(t). From the network size N (t) = S(t) +\ndt\nI(t) + R(t), the solution is given by N (t) = N (0) + at as\na linear growth. Fig. 6(a) shows the nullclines of\ndS\na\n=0: S=\n,\ndt\nb<k>I\ndI\n\u03b40\ndef\n= 0 : S = S\u2217 =\n, (I 6= 0)\ndt\nb<k>\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\nFIG. 4: Typical behavior of the spread on SF networks in (a)\na closed system and (b) an open system with simultaneously\nprogress of both spread of viruses and growth of network.

The directions of vector filed are dedI\nfined by the positive or negative signs of dS\ndt and dt .\ndef\n\nThere exists a stable equilibrium point (I \u2217 , S \u2217 ), I \u2217 = \u03b4a0 .\nThe states of S and I are converged to the point with a\ndamped oscillation. We can easily check the real parts of\neigenvalues for the Jacobian are negative at the point.\n\nB.\n\nHeterogeneous SIR model\n\nNext, we consider the heterogeneous SF networks at\nthe mean-field level, in which the connectivity correlations are neglected [16]. We know that static and grown\nnetworks have different properties for the size of giant\ncomponent [8] and the connectivity correlations [5][12]\neven if the degree distributions are the same. In particular, the correlations may have influence on the spread,\nhowever they are not found in all growing network models or real systems. We have experientially observed the\ncorrelations are very week in the (\u03b1, \u03b2) model in the\nprevious simulations as similar to the nearest neighbors\naverage connectivity in the generalized BA model rather\nthan the fitness model or AS in the Internet [20]. At\nleast, non-correlation seems to be not crucial for the absence of epidemic threshold [7][16][19][21], the existence\nof correlations is much still less nontrivial in e-mail net-\n\nIk\n\nI*k\n\ndI k/dt = 0\n\n(b)\nFIG. 6: Nullclines and the vector fields for (a) homogeneous\nand (b) heterogeneous SIR models. The state in both cases\nis converged to an equilibrium point with a damped oscillation, which is corresponded to persistent recoverable prevalence around the non-zero level I \u2217 or Ik\u2217 .\n\nworks. Although the mean-field approach by neglecting\nthe correlations in macroscopic equations at a large network size is a crude approximation method, it is useful\nfor understanding the mechanisms of the spread in growing networks, as far as it is qualitatively similar to the\nbehavior of viruses in the stochastic model or observed\nreal data. Indeed, the following results are consistent\nwith the analysis for correlated cases [10], except of the\nquantitative differences.\nWe introduce a linear kernel [12] as Nk (t) \u223c ak \u00d7 t,\nNk (t) = Sk (t) + Ik (t) + Rk (t), which are sum of the numbers of susceptible, infected, and recovered vertices with\ndef\n\u2212\u03bd\n, A > 0,\nconnectivity k, and the growth rate\nP ak = Ak P\n\u03bd > 2. Note that the total N (t) = k Nk (t) \u223c ( k ak )\u00d7\nt means a linear growth of network size. Since the maximum degree increases as progressing the time and approaches to infinity, it has a nearly constant growth rate\nR\u221e\nP\u221e\n1\u2212\u03bd\n\u2212\u03bd\nfor large t. As shown\ndk = Am\nk=m ak \u223c m Ak\n\u03bd\u22121\nin [12], the introduction of linear kernel is not contradiction with the preferential (linear) attachment [3] [4].\nAt the mean-field level in a somewhat large network\n\n\f6\na\n\nwith only the detection of viruses, the time evolutions of\nSk > 0 and Ik > 0 are given by\ndSk (t)\n= \u2212bkSk (t)\u0398(t) + ak ,\ndt\ndIk (t)\n= \u2212\u03b40 Ik (t) + bkSk (t)\u0398(t),\ndt\n\n(3)\n\nS\n-b<k>I\n\n(4)\nb<k>S\n\nwhere the shadow variable Rk (t) is implicitly defined by\ndef\ndef P\ndRk (t)\n= \u03b40 Ik (t).
