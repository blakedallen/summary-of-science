Quarks and gluons are\nconfined inside hadrons since they have color charges.\nEach color current of quark and gluon is gauge dependent, and therefore they are not physical observables.\nThe confinement of quarks and gluons is due to the nonabelian character of the gauge field theory, and the dynamics of quarks and gluons should be controlled by the\nkinematical constraints of the nonabelian nature of the\ngauge field theory. For example, the quark color current\nwhich is gauge dependent cannot come out from hadrons\nas the MIT bag model assumes [2]. In this respect, the\nconfinement should not simply be originated from the\nforce between quarks and anti-quarks. In fact, it has recently been shown that Wilson's area law between two\nquarks [3] is not physically justified and his area law is\nthe result of an artifact of Wilson's action. Indeed, Wilson's action inevitably picks up unphysical contributions\nto the Wilson loop integral [4] which results in a fictitious\narea law. Therefore, there is no confinement which arises\nfrom a linear potential between quarks inside hadrons.\nIn addition, it is, even more, difficult to define a force\nbetween quarks since the color charge of quarks is not a\nconserved quantity.\nThe gauge dependence of the quark color charge is well\nknown. Yet, it is somewhat puzzling that one often finds\ndiscussions in field theory textbooks concerning the shape\nof the quark-quark potential in the perturbative calculations. The potential between quarks may be defined if the\ncolor charge of quarks is a conserved quantity. However,\nsince the color charge of quarks is not conserved and is\nindeed gauge dependent in QCD, it is difficult to consider\nany interactions between quarks whose color charges are\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: fffujita@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\naddress: kanemaki@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\n\narbitrary time dependent numbers.\nIn this paper, we clarify that the gauge dependence\nof the quark-gluon interaction cannot be taken away by\nany kinds of transformation. Therefore, the quark-quark\npotential which is derived in the second and higher order\nperturbative calculations of the quark-gluon interaction\ncannot be a physical quantity since it depends on the\ngauge variable \u03c7a which is an arbitrary function of space\nand time.\nThe difficulty of evaluating interactions between\nquarks is also related to the non-existence of a free quark\nstate since one cannot carry out any perturbative calculations which are always based on the S-matrix formulation. As is well known, one has to prepare free quark\nstates as the initial and final states in the S-matrix evaluations. However, since there is no free quark state, one\ndoes not know how to proceed the S-matrix calculation\nin QCD as far as one wishes to be sufficiently careful.\nFor comparison, we briefly discuss the gauge dependence of the electron-photon interaction in the perturbation calculation. This is carefully examined in some\nof the field theory textbooks, and the potential between\nelectrons is well defined because the gauge dependence of\nthe electron-photon interaction is nicely eliminated under\nthe vector current conservation. This is closely related to\nthe fact that the electron charge is indeed conserved, and\none can always define a free electron state as a trivially\nsimple fact. In this respect, there is no problem in evaluating Feynman diagrams in a perturbation theory of\nQED.\nUnder the condition that the fermion current is not\nconserved, we show that the different choices of the gauge\nfixings (temporal gauge A0 = 0 and Coulomb gauge\n\u2207 * A = 0 ) give different Coulomb interactions. This\nis quite serious since one cannot rely on the perturbative calculations of the quark-quark interactions since the\ncolor quark current is not conserved. The only way out of\nthis dilemma may be to calculate the quark-quark interactions with the total Hamiltonian in a non-perturbative\nfashion since the total Hamiltonian is always gauge invariant. At the present stage, we do not know which\n\n\f2\nof the shape of the quark-quark inteactions may emerge\nfrom the non-perturbative treatment. We note that the\nMIT bag model assumes that the quark-quark interactions can be ignored and quarks are free inside hadrons\nand that the confinement must be realized by the boundary condition at the bag surface.\nHere, we also discuss an old but new physical quantity,\nthe conservation of the Noether current in QCD [1]. As\nlong as a physical quantity like charge is gauge invariant\nand is conserved, then there is a good chance that it\nmay be observed. Here, we discuss a conserved current\nwhich is composed of one quark and one gluon. This\nis the only conserved color current of QCD which must\nplay an important role for QCD dynamics. Since this\ncurrent is connected to the QG\u2212state, this state can be\na physical observable since it is gauge independent and\nhas a conserved charge. Therefore, this QG\u2212state has\na finite possibility of existence in nature even though it\nhas a color charge and a fractional electric charge. Up\nto now, there is no observation of the fractional charge\n[5, 6], but it does not mean that the object cannot be a\nphysical observable, at least, theoretically.\n\nwhere T a denotes the generator of SU (N ) group and n\nis related to N by n = N 2 \u2212 1. Here, T a satisfies the\nfollowing commutation relations\n[T a , T b ] = iC abc T c\nwhere C abc denotes the structure constant of the group\ngenerators.\nIn eq.(2.1), Tr { } means the trace of the group generators of SU (N ), and we make use of the following identity\nas a normalization of the representation of the generators\nTr{T aT b } =\n\n1\n\u03b4ab .\n2\n\nTherefore, the last term of eq.(2.1) can be rewritten as\n1\n1\n\u2212 Tr{G\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd } = \u2212 Ga\u03bc\u03bd Ga,\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n4\nwhere Ga\u03bc\u03bd is described as\nGa\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Aa\u03bc \u2212 gCabc Ab\u03bc Ac\u03bd .\n\nII.\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nQCD WITH SU (N ) COLORS\n\nThe properties of QCD are well discussed in field theory textbooks, but we review gauge dependent parts in\norder to make later discussions easier to understand. In\nparticular, we stress that the conservation law of the color\ncurrent is the only conserved current in connection with\nthe gauge fields in the theory. It is a well known fact that,\nin any field theory models without exception, a conserved\ncharge has been playing a dominant role for understanding its dynamics. In this sense, it is very strange that the\nconserved color current has not been carefully considered\nup to now when QCD dynamics is investigated and evaluated, and we believe it should be definitely necessary to\ntake into account the current conservation in some way\nor the other in order to obtain any important information\nof physical observables in hadron dynamics from QCD.\n\nB.\n\nInfinitesimal gauge transformation\n\nThe QCD Lagrangian density is invariant under the\nfollowing infinitesimal local gauge transformation with\n\u03c7 = \u03c7a T a\n\u03c8 \u2032 = (1 \u2212 ig\u03c7)\u03c8 = (1 \u2212 igT a\u03c7a )\u03c8\n\n(2.6a)\n\nA\u2032 \u03bc = A\u03bc + ig[A\u03bc , \u03c7] + \u2202\u03bc \u03c7\n\n(2.6b)\n\nwhere \u03c7 is infinitesimally small.

(4.3)\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe first term is a total divergence and thus does not\ncontribute to perturbative calculations. However, there\nis no way to eliminate the second term which is a gauge\ndependent term.\nTherefore, one sees that one cannot make any simpleminded perturbative calculations of quark-quark interactions in QCD, contrary to the QED case where the\nelectron-electron interaction is well defined and calculated as we will see below. This means that one cannot define any potential between quarks, and this is of\ncourse consistent with the picture that the color charge\nof quarks are not gauge invariant, and therefore it is time\ndependent.\n\n\u0001\n\u2202\u03bc \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc T a \u03c8 + C abc G\u03bc\u03bd,b Ac\u03bd = 0.\n\n(3.3)\n\nV.

In this case,\nwe obtain\na\n\na\n\n\u03b4L = L(\u03c8 \u2032 , \u2202\u03bc \u03c8 \u2032 , A\u2032 \u03bd , \u2202\u03bc A\u2032 \u03bd ) \u2212 L(\u03c8, \u2202\u03bc \u03c8, Aa\u03bd , \u2202\u03bc Aa\u03bd ) = 0.\nBy making use of the equations of motion for \u03c8 and Aa\u03bc ,\nwe obtain\n\u0002\n\u03b4L = \u2212ig(i\u2202\u03bc \u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc T a \u03c8 + i\u03c8\u0304\u03b3 \u03bc T a \u2202\u03bc \u03c8)\n\u0003\n+gC bca (\u2202\u03bc G\u03bc\u03bd,b Ac\u03bd + G\u03bc\u03bd,b \u2202\u03bc Ac\u03bd ) \u03b8a = 0.\n\nTherefore, we easily see that\n\nThis means that the Noether current\n\nis indeed conserved. That is,\n\u2202\u03bc I \u03bc,a = 0\n\nLI = \u2212ej\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212 e\u2202 \u03bc (j\u03bc \u03c7) + e(\u2202 \u03bc j\u03bc )\u03c7\n\n(3.6)\n\nThus, the quark color current alone is not conserved,\nand therefore there is no conservation of the quark color\ncharge. This is consistent with the fact that the color\ncurrent of quarks is not a gauge invariant quantity.\nIV. GAUGE NON-INVARIANCE OF\nINTERACTION LAGRANGIAN\n\nThe interaction Lagrangian density of QCD that involves quark color currents is written as\n(4.1)\n\nNow, the interaction Lagrangian density LI is not gauge\ninvariant, and therefore if one wishes to make any perturbation calculations involving the quark color currents,\nthen one should check it in advance whether one can\nmake the gauge invariant quark-quark interactions or\nnot.\nThe interaction Lagrangian density is transformed into\na new shape under the gauge transformation\nLI = \u2212gj\u03bca (A\u03bc,a + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c7a )\n\n(4.2)\n\n(5.2)\n\nand one sees easily that the second term in the right hand\nside is a total divergence and thus does not contribute to\nperturbative evaluations. The third term vanishes as long\nas the current conservation holds,\n\u2202 \u03bc j\u03bc = 0.\n\nLI = \u2212gj\u03bca A\u03bc,a .\n\n(5.1)\n\nHowever, eq. (5.1) can be rewritten as\n\nwhere the quark color current j\u03bca is defined as\nj\u03bca = \u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc T a \u03c8.\n\nLI = \u2212ej\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212 ej\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc \u03c7.\n\n(3.5)\n\n(5.3)\n\nTherefore, it is clear that the electron-photon interaction\nis gauge independent, and the potential between electrons is a well defined quantity in QED under the condition that the vector current is conserved. Therefore, one\ncan well calculate electron-electron potentials in the perturbation theory, which are Coulomb potential or some\nothers like hyperfine interactions\n\nVI.\n\nTWO CHOICES OF GAUGE FIXINGS\n\nNow, we present the evaluation of the quark-quark interactions when there is no conservation of the quark\ncurrent. Here, we suppress both the color degree and the\nexplicit gluon-gluon vertex in the calculations since they\nare not relevant in the present discussions.\n\n\f4\nSince there is no conservation of the quark current, the\nequation of motion becomes\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = g(j \u03bd + X \u03bd )\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere the extra current X \u03bd is introduced by hand here,\nbut, in QCD, this corresponds to the gluon currents.\nTherefore, we have \u2202\u03bc (j \u03bc + X \u03bc ) = 0, but \u2202\u03bc j \u03bc 6= 0.\nIn this case, we can easily calculate the Coulomb interaction for the different gauge fixings, the Coulomb gauge\n\u2207 * A = 0 and the temporal gauge A0 = 0, and show\nthat the different choices of the gauge fixing give indeed\ndifferent Coulomb interactions between quarks. This is\nconsistent with the observation in section IV.\nA.\n\n(6.2)\n\nWe take the Coulomb gauge\n\u2207 * A = 0.\n\n(6.3)\n\nSince the quark current is not conserved ( \u2202\u03bc j \u03bc 6= 0 ),\nthe equation of motion for the gauge field A0 becomes\nfrom eq.(6.1)\n\u22072 A0 = \u2212g(j0 + X0 ).\n\n(6.4)\n\nThis is just a constraint which can be easily solved, and\nwe obtain\nZ\ng\n(j0 (r \u2032 ) + X0 (r \u2032 )) d3 r\u2032\nA0 (r) =\n.\n(6.5)\n4\u03c0\n|r \u2032 \u2212 r|\nNow, we can make use of the following relation\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n2 3\n(\u2207A0 ) d r = \u2212\n(\u22072 A0 )A0 d3 r\n2\n2\n(j0 (r \u2032 ) + X0 (r \u2032 )) (j0 (r) + X0 (r)) d3 rd3 r\u2032\n|r \u2032 \u2212 r|\n(6.6)\nwhere the surface integrals are set to zero. Therefore, the\nCoulomb interaction becomes\nZ\nZ\n1\n3\nHC = gj0 (r)A0 (r)d r \u2212\n(\u2207A0 )2 d3 r\n2\ng2\n=\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n(j0 (r \u2032 ) \u2212 X0 (r \u2032 )) (j0 (r) + X0 (r)) d3 rd3 r\u2032\n|r \u2032 \u2212 r|\n(6.7)\nIt is clear that if we set X0 = 0, then we can recover the\nnormal Coulomb interaction.\ng2\n=\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nNow, we take the A0 = 0 and therefore the equation\nof motion for the gauge field beomes\n\u2207*\n\n\u2202A\n= \u2212gj0 .\n\u2202t\n\n(6.8)\n\nHere, there is still a gauge freedom left. Namely, E =\n\u2212 \u2202A\n\u2202t and B = \u2207 \u00d7 A are invariant under the following\ntransformation\nA \u2192 A + \u2207\u03c7(r)\n\n(6.9)\n\nA = AT + \u2207\u03be,\n\nwith\n\n\u2207 * AT = 0.\n\n(6.10)\n\nIn this case, the equation of motion for the gauge field\nbecomes\n\nH = \u03c8\u0304 (\u2212i\u03b3 * \u2207 + m) \u03c8 \u2212 gj * A + gj0 A0\ni\n1h 2\n\u0226 \u2212 (\u2207A0 )2 + B 2 .\n2\n\nTemporal gauge\n\nwhere \u03c7(r) depends only on the coordinate r.\nTherefore, we can write the vector field A as\n\nCoulomb gauge\n\nThe Hamiltonian of quarks interacting with the gauge\nfield can be written\n\n+\n\nB.\n\n\u22072 \u03c60 = \u2212g(j0 + X0 ),\n\nwith\n\n \u0307\n\u03c60 \u2261 \u03be.\n\n(6.11)\n\nTherefore, 21 \u02262 term in the Hamiltonian can be written\nT\nwith ET = \u2212 \u2202A\n\u2202t where ET is the transverse electric\nfield\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n\u02262 d3 r =\nET2 d3 r+ ET *\u2207\u03c60 d3 r+\n(\u2207\u03c60 )2 d3 r.\n2\n2\n2\n(6.12)\nThe second term in the right hand side vanishes and the\nthird term is just the same as the normal Coulomb interaction. Therefore, the Coulomb interaction with the\ntemporal gauge becomes\n(j0 (r \u2032 ) + X0 (r \u2032 )) (j0 (r) + X0 (r)) d3 rd3 r\u2032\n|r \u2032 \u2212 r|\n(6.13)\nwhich is different from the Coulomb interaction from\nthe Coulomb gauge fixing. Clearly again, if the extracurrent X0 is switched off, then we can recover the normal Coulomb interaction which, of course, agrees with\nthe one that is obtained from the Coulomb gauge fixing.\nTherefore, we see that the different choices of the gauge\nfixing give different Coulomb interactions when the current is not conserved. This confirms that the gauge invariance of the interaction term LI = \u2212gj\u03bca A\u03bc,a cannot\nbe recovered for the nonabelian gauge field theory like\nQCD since the quark currents alone are not conserved.\nThis means that the quark-quark interactions have some\ndifficulties when one starts from the perturbation theory.\nIt is unfortunate that one gluon exchange potential\nwhich has been very popular up to now does not make\nsense if one starts to calculate it from the perturbation\ntheory. We should find out some alternative expressions\nfor interactions between quarks and gluons.\nHC =\n\ng2\n8\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n\f5\nVII.\n\nQG\u2212STATE\n\nFrom eqs.(3.4) and (3.5), one sees that the color\noctet vector current of one quark and one gluon state\n( QG\u2212state ) is conserved. Therefore, the color charge\nQaI of the QG\u2212state which is defined as\nZ\na\nQI = I 0,a d3 x\n(7.1)\nis indeed a conserved quantity even though it is not a\ncolor singlet. In addition, the charge QaI of QG\u2212state is\na gauge invariant quantity.\nHere, one may ask as to whether this QG\u2212state can\nbe observables or not. The answer is yes, that is, it may\nphysically exist since it is gauge independent and a conserved quantity. At least, there is no reason to say that\nit cannot exist theoretically.\nOne may then ask whether this is a bound state or not.\nBut we believe it is not an important question whether\nit may be a bound state or something else. It is for\nsure that, once it were made, then there is no way to\ndecay since quark or gluon alone cannot exist by themselves. The only question, though rather serious, is that,\nin which way the QG\u2212state can be created. Or in other\nwords, what should be a probability of producing this\nobject from any kind of hadronic or leptonic reactions ?\nFor the above statement, one may claim that there is\nno fractional electric charge observed in nature [5, 6], and\ntherefore it should not exist. This may be right, but at\nthe present stage, we cannot claim more than what it is\nlike.\nSince we prove that the one gluon exchange potential\nbetween quarks is not a well defined quantity, we should\nask what is the potential between two nucleons. To this\nquestion, we can answer to some extent. Firstly, the\nmost important nucleon-nucleon potential must be given\nby the one pion exchange process. This is quite reasonable since pion which is a color singlet object can propagate between nucleons and should indeed produce a one\npion exchange potential which is a favorable object from\nexperiments. In addition to the boson exchange interac-\n\n[1] Fayyazuddin and Riazuddin, \"A modern introduction to\nparticle physics\", (World Scientific, 2000)\n[2] A. Chodos, R.L. Jaffe,K. Johnson, C.B.

This may cause a repulsive interaction between\nnucleons and it should be rather short range interactions. However, this mechanism of the QG exchange force\nshould be a future problem to be solved.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have examined the gauge invariance of the quarkgluon interaction in QCD. In most of field theory text\nbooks, people have carefully discussed the gauge dependence of the electron-photon interaction in QED and confirmed that the apparent gauge dependence of the interaction can be well eliminated. However, for QCD, the\ngauge invariance of the quark gluon interaction in the\ncontext of the perturbation theory has not been examined carefully in any of field theory textbooks. This may\nbe because the QCD case was treated just in the same\nas the QED case. Obviously, there is a serious difference\nbetween QCD and QED, which is essentially due to the\nnonabelian character of the gauge fields. Here, we have\nshown that the quark-gluon interaction in QCD is always\ngauge dependent and there is no way to eliminate the\ngauge dependence in the quark-gluon interaction. This\nmeans that one cannot define the quark-quark potential,\nat least, in a perturbative sense. Therefore, it should be\nmeaningless to discuss the shape of the quark-quark potential in perturbative calculations even though one can\ntreat a heavy quark in the non-relativistic kinematics in\nwhich the concept of potential itself is well defined.\nHowever, we have not presented any alternative for\nthe quark interactions with gluons, and this is a future\nproblem to be solved.\nFurther, we point out that there is a conserved quantity which is composed out of one quark and one gluon\nQG\u2212state, and this is gauge invariant and has a conserved charge. The possibility of its existence in nature\nshould be carefully examined.\n\n(2004)\n[6] A.S. Goldhaber, Jour. Math. Phys. 44, 3607 (2003) 3471\n(1974)\n[7] F. Mandl and G.
