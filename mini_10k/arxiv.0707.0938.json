Solution requires\naccurate calculations determining the spectra of random classical radiation which are in\nsteady-state equilibrium with various classical mechanical scattering systems. Calculations\nfor a few scattering potentials have been performed. Scattering calculations involving the\ndipole approximation for particles of very small charge in a harmonic potential[1] or in some\nnonlinear potentials have been carried out.[2][3] Although the harmonic potential gives\nno condition on the radiation spectrum other than spatial isotropy, the other potentials\nsuggest that the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum is the only radiation spectrum giving equilibrium\nbetween radiation and matter in classical physics.\n\nAlso, a class of potentials has been\n\ntreated when the scattering particle's linear momentum takes the relativistic form,[4] and\nagain the conclusion was that equilibrium required the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum.\nIt has been suggested for more than thirty years[3] that understanding of classical radiation equilibrium may require the use of relativistic scattering systems, specifically particles\nin Coulomb potentials.\n\nMore recently it has been noted that the unique value e of elec-\n\ntronic charge may also play a crucial role in classical radiation equilibrium.[5] In the last\ntwo decades, these suggestions have been been greeted with overwhelming rejection by the\nreferees at the leading physics journals.\n\nOne referee declared that these suggestions are\n\nmerely desperate searches for \"loopholes\" to avoid the obvious conclusion that classical\nphysics is associated with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Other referees have suggested that\nsuch ideas are so far from currently accepted physics that they were unpublishable unless a\ncomplete solution of the classical blackbody problem (and indeed of all atomic physics) was\npresented.\nNevertheless the fact remains that there has never been a classical scattering calculation involving the Coulomb potential, which is the only classical potential which has been\nextended to a fully relativistic system.\n\nNow the Coulomb potential is special not only\n\nbecause of its connections to relativistic physics but also because of its scaling symmetry\nproperties.\n\nSince most physicists seem unable to take seriously the need for relativistic\n\nscattering systems for blackbody radiation equilibrium, perhaps scaling symmetry (which\nis easy to analyze) may afford an easier glimpse into the problems of classical radiation\nequilibrium.\n\nA scaling analysis of scattering is what we carry out in this article.\n2\n\nWe\n\n\fcarry out precise calculations for a model scattering situation and note the scale invariance\nand universal character of the radiation spectrum associated with scattering involving the\nCoulomb potential and only the Coulomb potential.\n\nWe believe the results indicate the\n\nserious nature of the remaining \"loophole\" in the classical blackbody problem.\n\nII.\n\nCLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETIC ZERO-POINT RADIATION\n\nIn this article we carry out a model scattering calculation which represents a crude analogue to treating zero-temperature thermal radiation, classical electromagnetic zero-point\nradiation.\n\nNow apparently many physicists are still unaware of the concept of classical\n\nzero-point radiation, and indeed some referees at the leading physics journals regularly reject the possibility of classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation.\n\nHowever, classical\n\nzero-point radiation is an intrinsic part of classical electromagnetism which enters the theory as the homogeneous boundary condition on Maxwell's equations.[1] It is required in\norder to give a classical electromagnetic description of the experimentally observed van der\nWaals forces (Casimir forces) between macroscopic objects at zero temperature.[6] Furthermore, classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation in connection with electric dipole\nharmonic oscillator systems provides a classical description of a number of phenomena which\nare usually regarded as having only a quantum description, such as van der Waals forces,[1]\ndiamagnetism,[7] and thermal effects of acceleration through the vacuum.[8]\n\nA reader of\n\nthis manuscript who can not conceive of classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation may\nfind it hard to follow the logic of our model calculation. The decision to restrict our analogy\nto zero-temperature was made so as to simplify the analysis as much as possible and thereby\nhopefully make it transparent to readers.\nClassical zero-point radiation is the random classical radiation which is present at the\nabsolute zero of temperature. In order to fit the experimentally observed Casimir forces (as\ncalculated numerous times[9] under various conditions within classical electrodynamics), it\nmust take the form\nE\u03c9 = bzp \u03c9\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E\u03c9 is the average energy per normal mode of angular frequency \u03c9, and bzp is a\nconstant. For numerical agreement with the observed Casimir forces, the constant bzp must\n\n3\n\n\ftake the value\nbzp = 5.27 \u00d7 10\u221228 erg-sec\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is a familiar number.[10] The spectrum of zero-point radiation is (up to a multiplicative constant) the unique spectrum of random classical radiation which is Lorentz\ninvariant[11] and the unique spectrum which is scale invariant[12] under the \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling\nallowed by electromagnetism.[13]\n\nSince each normal mode of the electromagnetic field at\n\n(angular) frequency \u03c9 takes the form of a harmonic oscillator[14] at frequency \u03c9 and can be\ndescribable in terms of action-angle variables, it follows from Eq. (1) and E = J\u03c9 \u03c9 that\nthe average value of the action variable J\u03c9 (associated with each normal mode of frequency\n\u03c9) takes the same constant value bzp independent of \u03c9.\nSince classical electromagnetic radiation in an enclosure can not bring itself to equilibrium, the interaction of radiation with scattering systems represents the crucial element in\ndetermining the equilibrium spectrum. Thermal radiation equilibrium involves steady-state\nbehavior for both the scatterer and the radiation. The motion of the charged particles in\nmatter and the random radiation must fit together so that, on average, there is no change\nin the particle energy and no change in the spectrum of the random radiation. Presumably\nthere is some aspect encoded within the scatterers which produces the universal character\nfound for thermal radiation.\n\nIn this article we investigate the scattering of radiation by\n\ncharged particles in a crude model and find that the Coulomb potential possesses scaling\naspects which allow an associated universal radiation spectrum.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE MODEL CALCULATION\n\nIn our simplified model, we consider a single charged particle of mass m and charge e\nundergoing uniform circular motion with speed v = \u03c9r in a central potential V (r) = \u2212k/r n ,\nthe motion satisfying Newton's second law\nv2\nk\nm\u03b3 = n n+1\nr\nr\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b3 = (1 \u2212 v 2 /c2 )\u22121/2 . The orbital angular momentum of the particle is given by\nJ = rm\u03b3v\n\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\fNow if the particle undergoing uniform circular motion has charge e, then it will radiate\nenergy into the electromagnetic field at the rate[15]\nP =\n\n2 e2 4 4 2\n\u03c9 \u03b3 r\n3 c3\n\n(5)\n\nIn order to balance the energy loss to emitted electromagnetic radiation, we imagine a circularly polarized plane wave of angular frequency \u03c9 propagating along the axis perpendicular\nto the orbital motion. (We may picture the particle's motion as constrained by two frictionless plane sheets so that it remains in a fixed orbital plane despite the magnetic force\ndue to the plane wave, or else we can consider two counter-propagating plane waves so as\nto eliminate the magnetic field in the orbital plane.) The amplitude E0 of the electric field\nof the plane wave is taken as the smallest possible value such that the incident wave will\nprovide the energy loss given in Eq. (5). Thus we require\nP =\n\n2 e2 4 4 2\n\u03c9 \u03b3 r = eE0 v\n3 c3\n\n(6)\n\n2e 2 4\n\u03c9 v\u03b3\n3 c3\n\n(7)\n\nor, since r = \u03c9/v,\nE0 =\n\nwith an associated radiation energy density u for the incident plane wave\nu=\n\n\u0001\n1\n1 e2 4 2 8\nE02 + B02 =\n\u03c9 v \u03b3\n8\u03c0\n9\u03c0 c6\n\n(8)\n\nIn this fashion we make an association between a particle motion and and an electromagnetic\nfield corresponding to a steady-state coherent (in contrast to random) radiation scattering\nsituation. This association can be regarded as an analogue of the association between the\naverage particle motion and the electromagnetic spectrum which holds in classical thermal\nradiation equilibrium. Since both scattering situations involve the known classical electromagnetic interaction between charged particles and electromagnetic waves, we expect that\nexploring one situation may give us insights into the other.\n\nIV.\n\n\u03c3ltE \u22121 -SCALING SYMMETRY FOR CLASSICAL ELECTROMAGNETISM\n\nWe say that a system is \u03c3-scale invariant or has \u03c3-scaling symmetry if the system is\nmapped onto itself under a dilatation which multiplies appropriate quantities in the system\nby a factor of \u03c3. Although the set of all classical mechanical systems allows independent\n5\n\n\fscalings of length \u03c3l , time \u03c3t , and energy \u03c3E , classical electromagnetism allows only one\n\u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling symmetry which connects together the scalings of length, time and energy.[5]\nThe scaling coupling of length and time is required by the appearance of a fundamental\nvelocity c for electromagnetic radiation, and the coupling of energy and length is required\nby the appearance of a smallest elementary charge e in nature.\n\nUnder \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling,\n\nlengths are scaled as l \u2192 l\u2032 = \u03c3ltE \u22121 l, times are scaled as t \u2192 t\u2032 = \u03c3ltE \u22121 t, and energies\nare scaled as E \u2192 E \u2032 = E/\u03c3ltE \u22121 . It follows that all speeds are \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant since\nv = l/t \u2192 v \u2032 = (\u03c3ltE \u22121 l)/(\u03c3ltE \u22121 t) = l/t = v. Electric charge q is \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant since\nthe potential energy E between two point charges q a distance r apart behaves as q 2 = Er \u2192\nq \u20322 = E \u2032 r \u2032 = (E/\u03c3ltE \u22121 )(\u03c3ltE \u22121 r) = q 2 . Orbital angular momentum J is \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant\nsince J = rm\u03b3v \u2192 J \u2032 = r \u2032 m\u2032 \u03b3 \u2032 v \u2032 = (\u03c3ltE \u22121 r)(m/\u03c3ltE \u22121 )\u03b3v = rm\u03b3v = J . Electromagnetic\n2\nfields E and B scale under \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling as E = e/r 2 \u2192 E \u2032 = e/r \u20322 = e/(\u03c3ltE \u22121 r)2 = E/\u03c3ltE\n\u22121 .\n\nMass m is related to energy mc2 and so scales as an energy m \u2192 m\u2032 = m/\u03c3ltE \u22121 .\n\nV.\n\n\u03c3ltE \u22121 -SCALING SYMMETRIES FOR THE MODEL SCATTERING SYSTEMS\n\nWe are now in a position to note the scaling symmetries for the model scattering systems\ndescribed above. Under \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling symmetry, a potential energy function V (r) = \u2212k/r n\nis mapped to a new potential energy function V (r) \u2192 V \u2032 (r \u2032 ) = V (r)/\u03c3ltE \u22121 = \u2212k \u2032 /(r \u2032 )n =\n\u2212n\n\u2212n\n1\u2212n\n\u2032\nn\n\u2032\nn\n\u2032\nn\n= \u2212(\u03c3ltE\n\u2212k \u2032 /(\u03c3ltE \u22121 r)n = \u2212\u03c3ltE\n\u22121 k /r\n\u22121 k /k)k/r , or V (r) = \u2212(\u03c3ltE \u22121 k /k)k/r . Form\n\ninvariance requires that\nn\u22121\nk \u2032 = \u03c3ltE\n\u22121 k\n\n(9)\n\nThus the potential energy function retains its form under a \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling transformation\nif and only if the constant k appearing in the potential energy is also transformed to k \u2032 =\nn\u22121\n\u03c3ltE\n\u22121 k. Thus there is exactly one potential energy function which is \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant\n\nk \u2032 = k, and that is the potential energy function where n = 1, namely the Coulomb potential\nV (r) = \u2212k/r. If we write the potential function in terms of elementary charges of magnitude\ne, this is V (r) = \u2212e2 /r.\nThe \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariance associated with the Coulomb potential reappears in the equation for the orbital speed of the particle. Thus combining equations (3) and (4) for a general\npotential V (r) = \u2212k/r n , we can eliminate the orbital radius r so as to obtain an equation\nconnecting the orbital speed v and the orbital angular momentum J in terms of the particle\n6\n\n\fmass m and the potential parameter k\nv 2\u2212n \u03b3 1\u2212n =\n\nnk n\u22121\nm\nJn\n\n(10)\n\nThe Coulomb potential with n = 1 is very special because in this case (and only in this\ncase) the particle mass m disappears from Eq. (10) for the orbital speed giving\ne2\nk\n=\nJ\nJ\n\nv=\n\n(11)\n\nThis last equation is clearly \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant since v, e, and J are all invariant.\nThis matter of \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariance reappears in the scattering spectrum given by Eqs.\n(7) and (8) and gives a universal character to the spectrum. The electric field E0 appearing\nin Eq. (7) can be regarded as a function of the angular frequency \u03c9 of the wave (which\nexactly matches the angular frequency of the orbital motion of the mass m in the potential\nV (r)) and of the orbital particle speed v.\n\nFor the Coulomb potential (and only for the\n\nCoulomb potential), the orbital speed v as given in Eq. (11) is independent of the particle\nmass m. Thus the equations Eq. (7) and (8) for the electric field and the electromagnetic\nenergy density become\n2e\nE0 = 3 \u03c9 2\n3c\n\n\u0012\n\ne2\nJ\n\n\u0012 2 \u00132 #\u22122\n\u0013\"\ne\n1\u2212\nJc\n\nand\n\u0001\n1 e2 4\n1\nE02 + B02 =\n\u03c9\nu=\n8\u03c0\n9\u03c0 c6\n\n\u0012\n\ne2\nJ\n\n\u00132 \"\n\u0012 2 \u00132 #\u22124\ne\n1\u2212\nJc\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nWe notice that the radiation spectrum given by Eqs. (7) and (8) makes no reference whatsoever to the orbital motion of any charged particle m other than through the angular\nmomentum J. The spectrum associates an electric field E0 and corresponding electromagnetic energy density u with a given frequency \u03c9 and with fundamental constants e and c\nprovided that the value of any orbital angular momentum J is chosen as a constant, perhaps\nchosen as the same constant as appeared above in Eq. (2). Thus we have arrived at a universal spectrum of just the sort which we would want to associate with thermal radiation at\nzero temperature, classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation. We also emphasize that\nthe constant k = e2 can not be allowed to change continuously or the universal character of\nthe spectrum will be lost.\nUnder \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale transformation, the spectrum given in Eqs. (7) and (8) is invariant.\n2\nThe electric field transforms as E0 \u2192 E0\u2032 = E0 /\u03c3ltE\n\u22121 while the energy per unit volume\n\n7\n\n\f4\ntransforms as u \u2192 u\u2032 = u/\u03c3ltE\n\u22121 ; these transformation forms are matched by the powers of\n\n\u03c9 appearing on the right-hand sides of the equations while all the remaining parameters are\n\u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant.\nPerhaps it is helpful to characterize the uniqueness of the scattering spectrum (7) in the\nCoulomb case in a different way. If one rescales units according to \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling, the value of\nk appearing in the potential energy function V (r) = \u2212k/r n changes with the units for every\ncase except n = 1. Thus it is natural to regard k as a parameter available for an adiabatic\nchange in mechanics, except for the Coulomb potential function where the parameter e2 = k\nis \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant and can be chosen as fixed. The angular momentum J of a particle\nin orbit in the potential V (r) is an action variable and so is an adiabatic invariant which\ndoes not change with an adiabatic change of the parameter k. Thus for a general value of\nn, the different values of k for fixed mass m will involve different frequencies \u03c9 and different\nscattering electric fields E0 . This generates a spectrum connecting electric field strength E0\nand frequency \u03c9 for each fixed value of mass m. However, in general, different values of mass\nm will generate different spectral connections between E0 and \u03c9. Now we remember that\nthermal radiation equilibrium involves a unique equilibrium spectrum which is independent\nof the mass m of the charged particle which is scattering the radiation.\n\nIn our crude\n\nanalogue to thermal radiation scattering, we have found that the Coulomb potential energy\nfunction with unique charge e is associated with a unique spectrum connecting E0 and \u03c9\nindependent of the mass m of the orbiting particle.\n\nMoreover, the Coulomb scattering\n\npotential is the only potential energy function of the form V (r) = \u2212k/r n which gives such\na unique spectrum.\n\nVI.\n\nSCALING SYMMETRIES FOR SCATTERERS OF CLASSICAL ZERO-\n\nPOINT RADIATION\n\nThe \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scaling symmetries which we have noted above for our model scattering calculation reappear in the scattering of random radiation at zero-temperature corresponding\nto classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation.\n\n8\n\nThe zero-point radiation spectrum is\n\n\f\u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant. Thus the two-field correlation function is given by[13]\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03c3\u03c1\nFzp\n(x)Fzp\n(y)\n\n= g \u03bc\u03c3 \u2202x\u03bd \u2202y\u03c1 \u2212 g \u03bc\u03c1 \u2202x\u03bd \u2202y\u03c3 \u2212 g \u03bd\u03c3 \u2202x\u03bc \u2202y\u03c1 + g \u03c3\u03c1 \u2202x\u03bc \u2202y\u03bd\n\n\u0001\n\n2bzp c\n\u03c0(x \u2212 y)2\n\n(14)\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nwhere Fzp\n(x) is the electromagnetic field tensor, g \u03bc\u03bd is the metric for Minkowski spacetime,\n\nx and y are spacetime displacements, and bzp is the constant appearing in Eq. (2) which\nhas the units of angular momentum. Under a \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale transformation, the correlation\nfunction is invariant[13] since the the four inverse powers of \u03c3ltE \u22121 associated with the two\nfactors of electromagnetic field on the left-hand side are matched by the four inverse powers\nof space or time on the right-hand side.\nThe scattering equations for a particle of charge e in a Coulomb potential function V (r) =\n\u2212e2 /r can be given in manifestly Lorentz-covariant form. The particle motion follows the\nrelativistic form of Newton's second law including radiation reaction (which is usually known\nas the Lorentz-Dirac equation)[16]\n2 e2\nd2 x\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bd\n+ 3\nm 2 = eFCoul\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c4\n3c\n\n\u0012\n\nd3 x\u03bc\n1 dx\u03bc d2 x\u03bd d2 x\u03bd\n+\nd\u03c4 3\nc2 d\u03c4 d\u03c4 2 d\u03c4 2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n+ eFZP\n\ndx\u03bd\nd\u03c4\n\n(15)\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nwhere FCoul\ngives the electromagnetic fields of the Coulomb potential, the term involving\n\u03bc\u03bd\n2e2 /(3c3 ) gives the radiation damping, and Fzp\nis the random zero-point radiation with the\n\ncorrelation function given in Eq. (14). The scattered electromagnetic fields can be written\nin terms of the potentials as F \u03bc\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202 \u03bd A\u03bc , where the potentials satisfy the wave\nequation with source J \u03bc given by the scattering charged particle\n\u00032 A\u03bc =\n\n4\u03c0 \u03bc\nJ\nc\n\n(16)\n\n1\n(x) + 2\nc\n\nZ\n\n(17)\n\nwith solution\n\u03bc\n\nin\u03bc\n\nA (x) = A\n\nd4 x\u2032 D(x \u2212 x\u2032 )J \u03bc\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\nwhere Ain\u03bc is the vector potential for the incoming zero-point radiation Fzp\n= \u2202 \u03bc Ain\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u2202 \u03bd Ain\u03bc , while D(x \u2212 x\u2032 ) = 2c\u03b8(x0 \u2212 x\u20320 )\u03b4[(x \u2212 x\u2032 )2 ] is the retarded Green function for\nthe scalar wave\nequation, and J \u03bc is the current density for the scattering charged particle\nZ\nJ \u03bc (x) = ec d\u03c4 (dx\u03bce /d\u03c4 )\u03b4 4 [x \u2212 xe (\u03c4 )].\nSince under a scaling transformation, the mass m transforms inversely with \u03c3ltE \u22121 , while\n\n\u22122\nx\u03bc and \u03c4 transform directly with \u03c3ltE \u22121 , it follows that every term in Eq. (15) scales as \u03c3ltE\n\u22121\n\n9\n\n\fand hence that the equation is \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant provided the mass is transformed. The\nwave equation (16) involves three inverse powers of \u03c3ltE \u22121 on each side and hence is \u03c3ltE \u22121 \u22121\nscale invariant. Similarly, every term in Eq. (17) scales as \u03c3ltE\n\u22121 and hence that equation\n\nis also \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant. Since the scattering equations are scale invariant provided the\nmass m is transformed, we expect that the \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariance of the incoming zero-point\nradiation will be preserved for the Coulomb potential, just as the spectrum in our model\ncalculation is \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant independent of particle mass m. However, there has been\nno complete calculation showing the invariance of zero-point radiation under scattering by\na charged particle in a Coulomb potential.\nIn the physics literature, all of the scattering calculations for random classical radiation\ninvolve potentials other than the Coulomb potential. In the inertial frame where the radial\nforce on the orbiting particle takes the form F = nk/r n+1 , the particle equation of motion\ncorresponding to Eq. (15) for a general potential function will not be \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant\nsince invariance in form requires that the constant k be transformed with 1 \u2212 n factors of\n\u03c3ltE \u22121 , as in Eq. (9).\n\nSince for a general potential function the equations describing the\n\nradiation scattering are not \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariance, it should come as no surprise that the\n\u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariance of the income zero-point radiation is not preserved, just as it is not\npreserved in our model calculation if n 6= 1. Rather, the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum, which is\nnot \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant, seems to be the spectrum which is invariant for (at least dipole)\nscattering by more general classical potentials.[2][3][4]\nIt is also worth noting that zero-point radiation is the unique spectrum of random radiation which is Lorentz invariant.[11] Equation (14) gives the manifestly Lorentz covariant\ntwo-point correlation function for classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation.\n\nIn Eqs.\n\n(15)-(17) we have given the manifestly Lorentz-covariant form for the scattering equations.\nWe suggest again that the Lorentz-invariant character of zero-point radiation is likely to be\npreserved by such a scattering system. On the other hand, a general mechanical scatterer\nbreaks the Lorentz-invariance of the scattering equations. It does not seem surprising that\nthe Lorentz-invariant zero-point spectrum is transformed toward a non-Lorentz-invariant\nform by scattering systems which are not Lorentz invariant.\n\n10\n\n\fVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this article we have carried out a specific model calculation for the coherent electromagnetic radiation spectrum of minimum intensity which will hold a charged particle in a\ncircular orbit in a potential function V (r) = \u2212k/r n . We find that the radiation spectrum\nis \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariant and independent of the particle mass for a fixed value of angular\nmomentum only in the case where the Coulomb potential with fixed charge e2 provides the\nbasic mechanical behavior for the orbit. We have noted the \u03c3ltE \u22121 -scale invariance of the\nelectromagnetic radiation and the scattering equations for electromagnetic radiation when\nthe Coulomb potential is used. We believe that our arguments strongly suggest that the\nCoulomb potential may provide an electromagnetic scatterer which leaves invariant the zeropoint radiation spectrum. Rather than being merely a \"loophole\" in the problem of classical\nradiation equilibrium, this calculation is the fundamental classical calculation which needs\nto be performed.\nHowever, nonrelativistic quantum physics apparently has such a complete hold on the\nminds of many physicists, that they reject the possibility that some classical calculations\nstill need to be done to clarify the distinctions between classical and quantum phenomena.\n\n[1] T.
