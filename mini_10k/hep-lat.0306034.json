Strouthos\nDepartment of Physics, Box 90305, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708, USA.\n\narXiv:hep-lat/0306034v1 25 Jun 2003\n\nUsing the monomer-dimer representation of strongly coupled U (N ) lattice gauge theories with\nstaggered fermions, we study finite temperature chiral phase transitions in (2 + 1) dimensions. A\nnew cluster algorithm allows us to compute monomer-monomer and dimer-dimer correlations at\nzero monomer density (chiral limit) accurately on large lattices. This makes it possible to show\nconvincingly, for the first time, that these models undergo a finite temperature phase transition\nwhich belongs to the Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class. We find that this universality class is\nunaffected even in the large N limit. This shows that the mean field analysis often used in this limit\nbreaks down in the critical region.\n\nComputing quantities in Lattice QCD with massless\nquarks is notoriously difficult. Most known algorithms\nbreak down in the chiral limit. For this reason questions\nrelated to the universality of chiral phase transitions are\namong the many questions that remain unanswered. It is\noften difficult to compute critical exponents sufficiently\naccurately to rule out all possibilities except one.\nThe most useful simplification of lattice QCD occurs\nin the strong coupling limit which retains much of the\nunderlying physics of QCD except for large lattice artifacts. In this limit spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking\nand its restoration due to finite temperature effects have\nbeen studied using large N and large d expansions [1\u20133].\nHowever, since these approaches are based on mean field\nanalysis they cannot help in determining the universality\nof phase transitions.\nInterestingly lattice QCD with staggered fermions interacting through U (N ) gauge fields can be mapped into\na monomer-dimer system in the strong coupling limit [4].\nThese models contain an exact U (1) chiral symmetry, a\nremnant of the full chiral symmetry of QCD. When it\nwas proposed, the monomer-dimer representation offered\na new approach to study strongly coupled gauge theories\nclose to the chiral limit from first principles. Unfortunately, this dream has remained unfulfilled until now.\nAs in the weak coupling regime, most numerical simulations of the monomer-dimer systems have suffered from\ncritical slowing down close to the chiral limit and hence\nhave only allowed calculations with limited accuracy [5].\nRecently, a cluster algorithm has been discovered to\nstudy these strongly coupled lattice gauge theories in the\nchiral limit [6]. This allows precision calculations in the\nchiral limit for the first time. As a first application of this\nnew algorithm, in this article we study the finite temperature critical behavior in (2 + 1) dimensions. In agreement with expectations from universality, we find with\nvery high precision the chiral phase transition to be in\nthe same universality class as the Berezinski-KosterlitzThouless (BKT) transition [7]. Our results are comparable to other known high precision spin-model studies of\nthis universality class. We also show that the BKT transition persists even in the large N limit, showing that the\n\nmean field analysis breaks down in the critical region.\nAlthough our results will primarily be of interest to\nlattice gauge theorists, it is possible that they may have\na wider audience. We are basically studying monomerdimer models and such models have a long history [8, 9].\nThey have been studied extensively in the context of statistical and condensed matter physics. In the sixties,\nthese models attracted a lot of attention [10, 11] when\nit was shown that the Ising model can be rewritten as\na dimer model [12]. In the late eighties, these models\nbecame fashionable again in the quantum version [13] as\na promising approach to the famous Resonating-ValenceBond (RVB) liquid phase [14]. More recently the quantum dimer approach has again gained momentum since it\nwas shown that the RVB liquid phase is actually realized\non a triangular lattice [15]. This has raised hope that\ndimer models may also yield a theoretical understanding\nof the spin-liquid phase [16]. Inspite of these studies, as\nfar as we know, a BKT transition has not been studied\nin the context of a dimer model.\nThe partition function of the model we study in this\narticle is given by ([4])\nZ\n\u0001\nZ = [dU ]d\u03c8d\u03c8\u0304 exp \u2212S[U, \u03c8, \u03c8\u0304] ,\n(1)\nwhere [dU ] is the Haar measure over U (N ) matrices and\nd\u03c8 d\u03c8\u0304 specify Grassmann integration. At strong couplings, the Euclidean space action S[U, \u03c8, \u03c8\u0304] is given by\nthe fermionic part\ni\nh\nX\nX\n\u2020\n\u03c8\u0304i \u03c8i , (2)\n\u03c8i \u2212 m\n\u03b7hiji \u03c8\u0304i Uhiji \u03c8j \u2212 \u03c8\u0304j Uhiji\n\u2212\nhiji\n\ni\n\nwhere i refers to the lattice site on a periodic three dimensional cubic lattice of size Lx , Ly along the two spatial\ndirections and size Lt along the euclidean time direction,\nhiji represents the bond connecting the nearest neighbor\nsites i and j, Uhiji are N \u00d7 N unitary matrices associated\nwith the bond hiji and represent the gauge fields, \u03c8i is\nan N component column vector and \u03c8\u0304i is an N component row vector made up of Grassmann variables and\nrepresent staggered fermion fields at the site i. We will\nassume that the gauge links satisfy periodic boundary\n\n\f2\nconditions while the fermion fields satisfy either periodic\nor anti-periodic boundary conditions. The factors \u03b7hiji\nare the well known staggered fermion phase factors that\ndepend on the coordinates i(or j). We will choose them\n2\nto have the property that \u03b7hiji\n= 1 when hiji is a spatial\n2\nbond, and \u03b7hiji\n= T when hiji is a temporal bond. The\nexact form of \u03b7hiji is not important at strong couplings\n2\nsince only \u03b7hiji\nappears in the final partition function.\nThe real parameter T acts like a temperature. By working on asymmetric lattices with Lt << L and allowing\nT to vary continuously, one can study finite temperature\nphase transitions in strong coupling QCD [5].\nThe partition function given in eq.(1) can be rewritten\nas a monomer-dimer system given by\nZ =\n\n\u2032\nX\n\n[n,b]\n\nY\n\nhiji\n\n(zhiji )bhiji\n\n(N \u2212 bhiji )!\nbhiji !N !\n\nY N!\nmni ,\nn\n!\ni\ni\n\n(3)\nand is discussed in detail in [4, 6]. Here ni = 0, 1, 2, ..., N\nrefers to the number of monomers on the site i, bhiji =\n0, 1, 2, ..., N represents the number of dimers on the bond\n2\nhiji, m is the monomer weight, zhiji = \u03b7ij\nare the dimer\nweights. Note that while spatial dimers carry a weight\n1, temporal dimers carry a weight T . The sum is over\nall monomer-dimer configurations [n, b] which are constrained such that the sum of the number of monomers\nat each site and the dimers that touch the site is always\nN (the number of colors). The \u2032 in the sum reminds us\nof this constraint. In this work we choose Lx = Ly = L.\nComparing eqs. (3) and (1) we learn that zero\nmonomer density corresponds to the chiral limit. The\nbipartite nature of the lattice can be used to distinguish\nevery site j as either even or odd. If we define \u03c3j = +1\nfor an even site and \u03c3j = \u22121 for an odd site, it is easy\nto show that when m = 0 the action given in eq. (2) is\ninvariant under U (1) chiral transformations,\n\u03c8(j) \u2192 ei\u03c3j \u03b8 \u03c8(j), \u03c8\u0304(j) \u2192 \u03c8\u0304(j)ei\u03c3j \u03b8 .\n\n(4)\n\nThe results of [6] show convincingly that this U (1) chiral symmetry breaks spontaneously at zero temperatures\nin two spatial dimensions. In this article we study the\nfinite temperature critical behavior and show that it belongs to the BKT universality class as expected. For this\npurpose we compute the chiral susceptibility \u03c7s and the\nwinding number susceptibility \u03c7W , both of which are often computed in this context. The chiral susceptibility\nis equivalent to the spin susceptibility of classical XY\nmodels and is given by\n\u03c7s =\n\n1 X\n1 \u22022Z\nh\u03c8\u0304i \u03c8i \u03c8\u0304j \u03c8j i =\nV i,j\nV Z (\u2202m)2\n\nm=0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere V = L2 Lt is the lattice volume. It is easy to see\nthat \u03c7s is the integrated monomer-monomer correlation\n\nfunction. We define the winding number susceptibility\nby\n\u03c7W =\n\n\u03c0\nhW 2 + Wy2 i.\n2 x\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Wx and Wy are the winding numbers in the x\nand\nPand are given by Wx =\nP y directions respectively\n( i \u03c3i bhiji )/Lx ,and Wy = ( i \u03c3i bhiji )/Ly . In the definition of Wx and Wy the site j is chosen such that the\nbond hiji is along the positive x and y directions respectively.\nIn this study we fix Lt and compute \u03c7s and \u03c7W as\na function of L. There are striking predictions for the\nlarge L behavior of these quantities if the phase transition\nbelongs to the BKT universality class. If Tc represents\nthe critical temperature we expect\n\uf8f1\nT < Tc\n\uf8f2 L2\u2212\u03b7(T )\n(7)\n\u03c7s \u221d L1.75 [log(L)]0.125 T = Tc\n\uf8f3\nconstant\nT > Tc\nand\n\n\u03c7W\n\n\uf8f1\nT < Tc\n\uf8f2 1/[2\u03b7(T )]\n= [2 + 1/ log(L/L0 )] T = Tc\n\uf8f3\n0\nT > Tc\n\n(8)\n\nin the large L limit. At T = Tc the next to leading order\ncorrection is also shown since it can be important. The\ncritical exponent \u03b7(T ) is expected to change continuously\nwith temperature but remain in the range 0 \u2264 \u03b7(T ) <\n0.25 assuming the monomers carry a unit of U (1) charge.\nThese predictions have been discussed in [7, 17\u201319] and\nhave been used in [20, 21] earlier to demonstrate BKT\nbehavior. In order to confirm these predictions we have\ncomputed \u03c7s and \u03c7W using the algorithm discussed in\n[6], for lattice sizes ranging from L = 32 to L = 750 and\nthe number of colors from N = 1 to N = 32. We vary T\nwith fixed Lt = 4 to study the critical behavior.\nLet us first discuss our results for N = 1. In figures 1\nand 2 we plot \u03c7s and \u03c7W as functions of L. We find that\n\u03c7s fits extremely well to the form bL2\u2212\u03b7 when T \u2264 1.0\nwith \u03b7 changing continuously in the expected region. In\ntable I we show the fits along with their \u03c72 per degree\nof freedom (\u03c72 /d.o.f.). In the last column we give the\nresults for 1/(2\u03c7W ) on the largest lattices that we could\ncompute it. This value matches the value of \u03b7 obtained\nby the fits. The figures and the fits also indicate that\nwhen T \u2265 1.10 one is in the high temperature phase\nwith a finite correlation length.\nWhen 1.02 \u2264 T \u2264 1.06, we find that the values of \u03b7\ndo not match 1/2\u03c7W even on the largest lattices while\ntheir values are close to a quarter as expected near the\nphase transition. There are noticeable finite size effects\nin \u03c7W .

The inset shows \u03c72 /d.o.f vs. T for the fit \u03c7W = 2 +\n1/ log(L/L0 ) which is valid only at Tc .\n\nalso fit the data for \u03c7W to the form (c+1/ log(L/L0 )) following [20]. The last column of table II shows the values\nof 1/2c obtained from the fit. We find that the logarithmic terms are unimportant for T \u2264 1.0 as expected.\nHowever, they appear to affect the value of \u03b7 and 1/(2c)\n(which is 1/(2\u03c7W ) in the thermodynamic limit) in the\nrange 1.02 \u2264 T \u2264 1.06. In particular the value of 2r is\nconsistent with expectations at T = 1.04. Further, the\nnew values of \u03b7 are closer to 1/2c. Using the fact that\n\u03c7W = (2 + 1/ log(L/L0 )) is exactly valid at T = Tc we\nfit the data for \u03c7W to this form for various values of T .\nIn the inset of figure 2 we plot \u03c72 /d.o.f as a function\nof T . Based on where the minimum occurs we estimate\nTc = 1.040(5).\nWe have checked that \u03c7s and \u03c7W show similar evi-\n\ndence for a BKT transition at higher values of N . Using techniques similar to the N = 1 we have computed Tc for various values of N . We find that Tc =\n0.708(6)N + 1.40(4) \u2212 1.07(4)/N fits our results very well\nfor all values of N with a \u03c72 /d.o.f of 1.1. The detailed\nanalysis of results at higher N and the dependence of\nnon-universal critical properties on Lt will be presented\nelsewhere.\nWith regards to the N dependence of our results we\nfind two interesting observations. When N approaches\ninfinity it is often believed that a mean field analysis becomes useful. Here we argue that there are exceptions\nto this lore. Consider the Mermin-Wagner-Coleman theorem which shows that a continuous symmetry cannot\nbreak in two dimensions [22]. However, it can be shown\nthat \u03b7 = 0 at N \u2192 \u221e in the mean field approach, which\nmeans that the condensate is non-zero. Clearly, this cannot be true at any large but finite N . Witten has argued\nthat when the symmetry is U (1) the large N analysis is\nstill applicable since \u03b7 \u223c 1/N at large N [23]. Our results\nfor a fixed T = 1.0, shown in figure 3, do agree with this\nconjecture. Interestingly, as N becomes large and T /Tc\nis held fixed instead of T , we find that \u03b7 6= 0 even in the\nlarge N limit. Figure 4 shows that \u03b7 approaches an interesting function of T /Tc as N becomes large. Extending\nthis observation to QCD, we think that the t'Hooft limit\n(large N, small gauge coupling g, with g 2 N held fixed)\nmay be quite similar [24].\nIn strictly two dimensions the monomer-monomer cor-\n\n\f4\nbreaking of a global U (1) chiral symmetry in three dimensions. The winding numbers Wx and Wy we have\ndefined are exactly the magnetic flux in the x and the\ny directions obtained using the magnetic field defined in\n[26]. We interpret the divergence free magnetic field as\nthe conserved current related to the U (1) chiral symmetry.\n\n0.25\n0.2\n\n\u03b7 0.15\n\nWe would like to thank P. Hasenfratz, R.

We think a closer examination of this result in\nthe context of BKT transitions would be interesting.\nFinally we note that the N = 1 model has been recently studied in [26] on various types of lattices, using\nanother algorithm which is efficient in measuring dimerdimer correlations at zero monomer density [27]. The\nauthors of [26] show the existence of a Coulomb phase\nin three dimensions on cubic lattices. Our results support this observation indirectly, however we interpret the\nresults differently. We use the connection of the dimer\nmodel with strongly coupled lattice QED to show that\nthe long range correlations are a result of a spontaneous\n\n[1] N. Kawamoto and J. Smit, Nucl. Phys.
