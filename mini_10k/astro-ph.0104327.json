Gaisser\nBartol Research Institute, University of Delaware\nNewark, DE 19716\nNovember 10, 2018\n\nAbstract\nSimple approximations for fluxes of atmospheric muons and muon neutrinos are\ndeveloped which display explicitly how the fluxes depend on primary cosmic ray energy\nand on features of pion production. For energies of approximately 10 GeV and above\nthe results are sufficiently accurate to calculate response functions and to use for\nestimates of systematic uncertainties.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere are several reasons for which it is useful to have simple approximations for production of muons and neutrinos by interactions of cosmic-ray nucleons in the atmosphere.\nFirst, the dependence on pion and kaon production, as well as the dependence on energy\nof the primary cosmic rays can be displayed explicitly. This is useful to make estimates\nof the systematic errors in the expected signals in muon and neutrino detectors that arise\nfrom uncertainties in the primary cosmic-ray spectrum and in meson production, which\nin general depend on energy.\nThe dependence of the signal in a particular detector on the primary energy spectrum\nis its response function. The classical use of response functions for muon telescopes [1]\nis to interpret measurements of solar modulation of muons as a function of muon energy\nand geomagnetic latitude [2]. In addition, response functions are useful for planning and\noptimizing Monte Carlo simulations of detectors because they display explicitly the relative\nportion of the signal that comes from each part of the primary spectrum.\nFor power-law spectra the analytic approximations for fluxes of muons and neutrinos\nare well-known [3, 4, 5]. In this paper we develop approximations which also display the\ndependence on primary energy. Such approximations allow semi-analytic evaluation of\nresponse functions. They can also be used to estimate the muon-induced signal produced\nby a fluence of protons with an arbitrary energy spectrum and time profile, such as might\nbe associated with a strong solar event.\n\u2217\n\nThis research is supported in part by the US Department of Energy grant DE-FG02 91ER 40626.\n\n1\n\n\fThe approximate results here are valid for muons and muon-neutrinos at relatively\nhigh energy, of order ten GeV and above. This includes the interesting cases of underground measurements of atmospheric muons and of upward energetic muons induced by\natmospheric neutrinos. The same results can, of course, be obtained with greater precision\nand for low energies, including electron neutrinos, by Monte Carlo simulations or by more\ncomplicated numerical calculations. The analytic approximations are nevertheless useful\nfor the insight they provide and for the diagnostic purposes mentioned above.\n\n2\n\nDerivation of analytic approximations\n\nThe differential production spectra of muons and neutrinos of energy E from decay of\npions in atmospheric cosmic ray cascades are given by\ndN\ndE dE\u03c0 dEN dX\n\nX dX \u2032\nS(E, E\u03c0 ) 1\n=\nP\u03c0 (E\u03c0 , X, X \u2032 )\n(1 \u2212 r\u03c0 )E\u03c0 d\u03c0 0 \u03bbN\n1\n\u2032\n\u00d7 FN \u03c0 (E\u03c0 , EN ) e\u2212X /\u039bN \u03c6(EN ),\nE\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n(1)\n\nwhere P\u03c0 (E\u03c0 , X, X \u2032 ) is the probability that a charged pion produced at slant depth\nX \u2032 (g/cm2 ) survives to depth X (> X \u2032 ). For muons the kinematic factor, S(E, E\u03c0 ),\nhas the form\nE\u03bc,0\n\u2212 E\u03c0 ),\n(2)\nS\u03bc (E\u03bc,0 , E\u03c0 ) = \u0398(E\u03c0 \u2212 E\u03bc,0 ) \u0398(\nr\u03c0\nwhile for muon neutrinos it is\nS\u03bd\u03bc (E\u03bd , E\u03c0 ) = \u0398(E\u03c0 \u2212\n\nE\u03bd\n),\n(1 \u2212 r\u03c0 )\n\n(3)\n\nm2\n\nwhere r\u03c0 = m2\u03bc . Here \u0398 is the Heaviside step function, and the subscript 0 in Eq. 2\n\u03c0\nindicates muon energy at production (see Appendix).\nThe contribution from kaon-decay has the same form as Eq. 1 with appropriate changes\nin kinematic factors and an overall factor for the branching ratio of BK\u2192\u03bc\u03bd = 0.635.\nThe various parameters relevant for N \u2192 [K, \u03c0] \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc are summarized in Table 1. The\ndifferences between the decay parameters for kaons and pions and between the mass ratios,\nr\u03c0 and rK are responsible for the striking difference between the importance of kaons for\nneutrinos as compared to muons. In particular, kaons become the dominant source of\natmospheric neutrinos for E\u03bd larger than \u223c 100 GeV even though more pions than kaons\nare produced.\nThe integral in Eq. 1 is over atmospheric depth X \u2032 measured in g/cm2 along the\ntrajectory of the incident particle at zenith angle \u03b8. The nucleon interaction length is \u03bbN .\nThe factor exp{\u2212X \u2032 /\u039bN } \u03c6(EN ) is the flux of nucleons of energy EN at slant depth X \u2032 ,\nwhere \u039bN is the nucleon attenuation length in the atmosphere and \u03c6(EN ) is the primary\nspectrum of nucleons per GeV/nucleon. The superposition approximation [6] is used for\nnucleons bound in nuclei.\nThe normalized inclusive cross section for N + air \u2192 \u03c0 \u00b1 + X is\nFN \u03c0 (E\u03c0 , EN ) =\n\nE\u03c0 d\u03c3(E\u03c0 , EN )\n\u2248 c+ (1 \u2212 x)p+ + c\u2212 (1 \u2212 x)p\u2212 ,\n\u03c3N\ndE\u03c0\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fTable 1: Parameters for atmospheric \u03bc+ + \u03bc\u2212 and \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc\nMass-square ratios:\nr\u03c0\nrK\n0.573\n.046\nCharacteristic Edecay : \u01eb\u03c0\n\u01ebK\n\u01eb\u03bc\n115 GeV\n850 GeV\n1 GeV\nAttenuation lengths:\n\u039b\u03c0\n\u039bK\n\u039bN\n\u03bbN\n2\n2\n2\n160 g/cm\n180 g/cm\n120 g/cm\n86 g/cm2\nTable 2: Parameters for kaon and pion production\nc+\np+\nZ+\nc\u2212\np\u2212\nZ\u2212\ncharged pions 0.92\n4.1\n0.047\n0.81 4.8 0.034\ncharged kaons 0.037 0.87 0.0089 0.045 3.5 0.0028\nwhere x = x\u03c0 = E\u03c0 /EN . The parameters of this scaling approximation are fixed by\ncomparison to accelerator data in the sub-TeV range [4], and the adequacy of the simple\napproximation is verified later by comparison of the calculated neutrino flux to the result\nof a complete Monte Carlo calculation. A more complicated or precise expression could\nbe used for the inclusive cross section if desired. The expressions for kaons have the same\nform, and the numerical values used in this paper are given in Table 2.\nThe survival probability in Eq. 1 is a product of survival against decay and survival\nagainst interaction.\n\u2032\n\nP\u03c0 (E\u03c0 , X, X ) =\n\n\u0012\n\nX\u2032\nX\n\n\u0013\u01eb\u03c0 /E\u03c0 cos \u03b8\n\nexp{\u2212(X \u2212 X \u2032 )/\u039b\u03c0 }.\n\n(5)\n\nUse of the pion attenuation length, \u039b\u03c0 , rather than the pion interaction length, \u03bb\u03c0 < \u039b\u03c0 ,\nin the interaction factor of Eq. 5 accounts approximately for the regeneration of charged\npions when pions interact in the atmosphere. The first factor in Eq. 5 is the probability\nfor survival against decay, and the explicit form used here is valid in the approximation\nof an exponential atmosphere with scale height h0 and decay constant \u01eb\u03c0 = m\u03c0 c2 h0 /c\u03c4\u03c0 .\nFinally, 1/d\u03c0 = \u01eb\u03c0 /(E\u03c0 X cos \u03b8) is the differential pion decay probability (per g/cm2 )\nin an exponential atmosphere. The simple angular dependence displayed here is valid\nwhen the curvature of the Earth can be neglected (\u03b8 \u2264 60\u25e6 ). For large angle the analysis\nis more complicated, but one approach is to use the same form with cos \u03b8 replaced by an\neffective value that depends on \u03b8 [7].\nThe next step is to carry out the integral over the production depth, X \u2032 , in Eq. 1.\nThis is done by expanding the exponential of X \u2032 and expressing the result as a series of\nthe form\n\u0013n\u22121\n\u221e \u0012\ndX \u2032\n1\nX\ne\u2212X/\u039b\u03c0 X\n=\n(\u2212a\u03c0 )\n,\n\u03bbN\n\u03bbN n=1 \u039b\u03c0\nn!(1 + nE\u03c0 cos \u03b8/\u01eb\u03c0 )\n0\n(6)\nwhere a\u03c0 = \u039b\u03c0 /\u039bN \u2212 1 \u2248 0.33. Substituting this expression into Eq. 1 we can now\nintegrate over all depths X of pion decay. The upper limit of this integral can safely be\nextended to infinity since most production of secondaries occurs well above the ground.\n\n1\nd\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nP\u03c0 (E\u03c0 , X, X \u2032 ) e\u2212X\n\n\u2032 /\u039b\n\nN\n\n3\n\n\fThe result for \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc is\nS\u03bd (E\u03bd , E\u03c0 ) 1\ndN\n=\nFN \u03c0 (E\u03c0 , EN ) G\u03c0 (E\u03c0 , \u03b8) \u03c6(EN ).\ndE\u03bd dE\u03c0 dEN\n(1 \u2212 r\u03c0 )E\u03c0 E\u03c0\n\n(7)\n\nThe physics of cascade propagation is included in Eq. 7 by the factor\n\u221e\n\u039b\u03c0 X\nG\u03c0 (E\u03c0 , \u03b8) =\n\u03bbN n=1\n\n(\n\n(\u2212a\u03c0 )n\u22121\n1 + n E\u03c0 cos \u03b8/\u01eb\u03c0\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThe contribution from kaons has the same form with aK = \u039bK /\u039bN \u2212 1 \u2248 0.5.\nThe dependence on the inclusive cross sections for pion (and kaon) production by nucleons can be displayed immediately in the approximation of a power-law primary spectrum\nby changing variables from {E\u03bd , E\u03c0 , EN } to {E\u03bd , x\u03c0 , z = x\u03c0 EN } and integrating over z to\nobtain\nZ \u221e\ndN\ndz\n\u03b3\u22121 FN \u03c0 (x\u03c0 )\nG\u03c0 (z, \u03b8) \u03c6(z),\n(9)\n= (x\u03c0 )\ndE\u03bd dx\u03c0\n1 \u2212 r\u03c0\nE\u03bd /(1\u2212r\u03c0 ) z\nwhere \u03b3 is the integral spectral index.

Dependence on these processes is contained\nin the attenuation lengths, \u039bN and \u039b\u03c0 [\u039bK ]. which appear respectively in Eq. 1 and in\nthe expression for G\u03c0 [GK ] as defined in Eq. 8. The attenuation lengths are related to the\nrespective interaction lengths and inclusive cross sections by \u039bi = \u03bbi /(1 \u2212 Zi\u2192i ), where\ni stands for nucleon (N = p or n), charged pion or charged kaon. Note from Eq. 8 that \u039b\u03c0\ncancels out of the expression when E\u03c0 /\u01eb\u03c0 \u226a 1, reflecting the fact that low energy pions\n[kaons] usually decay before they interact. The small cross processes K \u00b1 \u2194 \u03c0 \u00b1 , as well\nas neutral kaons, are neglected as sources of \u03bd and \u03bc in these approximations.\n\n3\n\nResponse Functions and Fluxes\n\nTo obtain the response function, the integral over pion energy is carried out in Eq. 7\nmaking use of the scaling approximation of Eq. 4.

The values of parameters that have been used in the analytic\napproximations are listed in Tables 1 and 2. They correspond most closely to the hadroproduction model of Ref. [8] for interaction energies around 100 GeV. The approximation falls\nbelow the neutrino flux at low energy primarily because the contribution from muon decay\nis not included in the approximation. At high energy the approximation is 10-15% higher\nthan the Monte Carlo, because the simple, energy-independent forms for kaon production\nused here are not identical to the actual representation in the Monte Carlo. The analytic\napproximations could be tuned to give a better representation of this [8] or any other\ninteraction model, but doing so is not the object of this paper.

These include\npropagation of errors, calculation of response functions and evaluation of the phase space\nregions that are most important for the determining the fluxes of neutrinos and muons.\nIn Fig. 3 I show the fractions of \u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc from \u03c0 \u00b1 and from K \u00b1 to demonstrate the\nimportance of kaon production. Note that over the entire energy region, approximately 7075% of \u03c6\u03bd comes from free protons (most of the rest is from nucleons in primary helium) [9].\nThus, any uncertainty from the approximate, superposition model treatment [6] of bound\nnucleons will be small.\nHaving established that the method is adequate, the next step is to calculate the\nresponse functions for a range of energies. This is illustrated in Fig. 4 for muons and\nneutrinos. Note that the neutrino response is shifted to higher primary energy than the\nresponse for muons. In addition, it is slower to reach an asymptotic form. These features\nare consequences of the kinematics of \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc as compared to K \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bc coupled with the\ngreater relative importance of kaons for neutrinos at high energy. Pions must have more\nthan twice the energy of daughter \u03bd\u03bc , while E\u03c0 \u2265 E\u03bc,0 (compare Eqs.2,3). This shifts the\n\u03bd\u03bc response to higher energy when the pion chain is dominant. At higher energy, where\nkaons dominate the production of \u03bd\u03bc the response shifts to lower energy.\n\n4\n\nEstimates of Uncertainties\n\nTo illustrate how the formalism presented here can be used to estimate uncertainties in\nthe calculated result, we consider the example of vertically upward, neutrino-induced,\nthrough-going muons at Super-Kamiokande [10].

The heavy line shows the corresponding distribution of parent nucleon energies.\nThis distribution should be used to weight the uncertainties in the input in a convolution\nover primary energy. A similar analysis can be made for neutrino-induced muons that\nstop inside the detector.\nThere are two main sources of uncertainties in calculations of fluxes of muons and\nneutrinos with energies in the multi-GeV range and above. We deal first with those\narising from uncertainties in the primary spectrum and then with those from uncertainties\nin treatment of pion and kaon production.\n\n4.1\n\nPrimary spectrum\n\nSince approximately 75% of high energy atmospheric neutrinos are produced by incident\nprotons, I concentrate on that component of the cosmic-ray spectrum for the analysis of\nuncertainties. A summary of data is shown in Fig. 6. The solid line is the proton spectrum\nused in Ref. [8], which I take as the reference spectrum. The resulting uncertainty in the\nflux of atmospheric neutrinos that is relevant for the Super-K example will be a convolution\nof the uncertainties in the data of Fig. 6 with the response function shown as the heavy\nsolid line in Fig. 5.\nIt is natural to divide the discussion into three energy regions:\n4.1.1\n\nUp to \u223c 100 GeV\n\nPrimaries with energies below 100 GeV are the most precisely measured.

While they do not cover the full range of interest they\ncan be used to renormalize the single measurement [19] that spans the important energy\nrange up to \u223c 1 TeV. Several measurements have been made in the past decade with\nballoon-borne magnetic spectrometers capable of making relatively precise momentum\nmeasurements for well-identified protons and nuclei. Since the LEAP experiment [12],\nfive other experiments [13, 14, 15, 16, 17] confirm a significantly lower normalization than\nthe earlier standard reference [18]. Particularly noteworthy are the BESS98 [17] and the\nAMS [15] measurements, which agree with each other to within 5% over two decades in\nenergy. These data have been used as the basis of a new fit [9] as shown in Fig. 6. The\nsystematic uncertainty in the primary spectrum below 100 GeV is estimated in Ref. [9] as\n< \u00b15%.\n4.1.2\n\nUp to \u223c 1 TeV\n\nThe energy region from 0.1 to 2 TeV, explored by the large balloon-borne tracking calorimeter of Ryan et al.

The remaining overall\nuncertainty in this energy region is \u223c \u00b110%.\n4.1.3\n\nThe multi-TeV region\n\nMost of the data in this energy range comes from balloon flights of emulsion chambers, [20,\n21, 23] which measure only the electromagnetic component of the energy deposited by the\ninteracting proton in the chamber. This is subject to large fluctuations superimposed on\nthe uncertainty in the underlying inelasticity distribution of protons when they interact\nin the emulsion chamber. There is also one measurement in this energy region made with\na tracking calorimeter carried on flights of the SOKOL satellite [22].\nThe uncertainties in these measurements are at the level of \u00b125%. In addition, there\nis an indication that the flux falls below the reference spectrum above \u223c 20 TeV by up to\na factor of 2. However, the contribution from protons with EN > 20 TeV to the energy\nrange responsible for \u03bd\u03bc -induced upward muons is small.\n9\n\n\fPrimary proton spectra\nBartol flux [8]\nNew fit [9]\nLEAP [12]\nCAPRICE [13]\nMASS91 [14]\nAMS [15]\nIMAX [16]\nBESS98 [17]\nWebber [18]\nRyan et al.

The figure illustrates\nthe growing relative importance of kaons. It also illustrates the importance of the extreme\nforward fragmentation region for the contribution of kaons, reflecting the leading p \u2192\n\u039b + K + process. The shapes are scale invariant in the approximations used here, and\nthey indicate the regions of phase space that are important for production of atmospheric\nneutrinos.\nA global estimate of the uncertainty due to pion and kaon production is obtained, as in\nRef.

For upward, through-going muons in Super-Kamiokande, as shown in Fig. 5,\nthe three energy regions of the primary spectrum, < 0.1 TeV, 0.1 < EN < 1 TeV and\n> 1 TeV contribute respectively fractions of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.4 to the signal. Weighting and\nadding the corresponding three uncertainties (\u00b1.05, \u00b1.10, \u00b1.25) in quadrature gives an\noverall uncertainty of \u00b111% due to the primary spectrum. Uncertainties in ZN \u03c0 and ZN K\nare estimated in Ref. [8] as \u00b112% and \u00b117% respectively. Roughly equal fractions of the\nsignal are from pions and kaons, so the combined uncertainty from the interaction model\nis \u223c \u00b110% giving an overall estimated uncertainty of \u00b115%.\nFor upward, stopping muons in Super-K, the corresponding analysis shows that essentially all the signal comes from primaries with E < 1 TeV/nucleon, of which \u223c 60% are\nin the well-measured region between 10 and 100 GeV. Thus the weighted uncertainty due\nto uncertainty in the primary spectrum is estimated as \u00b15%. For this lower energy sam11\n\n\fple, approximately two-thirds are from decay of pions, so the weighted uncertainty from\nhadronic interactions is also somewhat smaller than for through-going muons, \u00b110%, giving a combined uncertainty of \u00b111%.\nCombining these two numbers results in an estimate of \u00b119% for the uncertainty in the\ncalculated ratio of stopping to through-going neutrino-induced, upward muons in Super-K\nexpected in the absence of oscillations.\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nThe main results of the paper are contained in Eq. 9 and in Eqs. 11 and 12 [and the\ncorresponding expressions for kaons]. Eq. 9 displays explicitly how the flux depends on\nthe phase space for pion [kaon] production. One can see from the corresponding plots\nwhich regions of phase space need to be measured in experiments such as HARP [24], in\norder to improve the input to calculations of atmospheric neutrinos.\nEqs. 11 and 12 show respectively the response functions for \u03bd\u03bc and for muons. These\ncan be convolved with the response of an underground detector to neutrinos or muons to\nshow how the signal depends on the primary spectrum. The response functions in Fig. 4\ncan also be used as an aid in planning a Monte Carlo calculation of atmospheric muon or\nneutrino fluxes and their signals in a particular detector. By knowing the distribution of\nprimary energies that contribute to the neutrino (or muon) flux at E\u03bd(\u03bc) , one can determine\nin advance the range and distribution of primary energies needed to obtain a result with\nsufficient statistical accuracy.\nSince the formulas 11 and 12 display the dependence on primary energy explicitly,\nthey can also be used to estimate the signal from a primary spectrum of arbitrary shape\nand evolution, such as might be associated with a violent solar flare. Applications to\ncalculation of neutrino fluxes in astrophysical beam dumps (with appropriately modified\ncascade propagation factors, G\u03c0,\u03bc ) are also possible.\nIn \u00a74 we gave an example of the use of the semi-analytic approach in estimating \"theoretical\" uncertainties in an expected neutrino-induced signal. A complementary approach\nis simply to compare different, independent calculations of the spectrum of atmospheric\nneutrinos. Fig. 8 shows a comparison of four calculations. The calculations of Ref. [8]\nand [25] are one-dimensional Monte Carlo calculations. The calculation of Ref. [5] is an\nanalytic calculation assuming a pure power-law primary spectrum of nucleons and scaling\nfor the inclusive cross sections. These three calculations are within a range of \u2248 10% of\neach other over the relevant range of energies. Several earlier calculations are compared\nin Fig. 7 of Ref. [8] and are also within this range. The three-dimensional calculation of\nBattistoni et al. [26] is shown by the points in the figure. (Because of the complexity of\nthe 3-D calculation, statistics in the near vertical bin are limited at present, especially so\nat the high-energy end [27].) The calculation of Ref. [26] assumed the same primary spectrum as used in Ref. [8]. In addition, the energy range here is well into the region for which\nthree-dimensional effects can be neglected. The differences are therefore presumed to be a\nresult of differences in the representation of pion and kaon production. The authors of the\ncalculations shown in Fig. 8 are in the process of comparing hadronic interaction models\nwith the goal of minimizing this source of uncertainty in the calculations of atmospheric\nmuons and neutrinos.\n\n12\n\n\fCalculated vertical neutrino fluxes\n800\n\n3\n-2 -1 -1\n2\nE\u03bd dN\u03bd/dE\u03bd(m sr s GeV )\n\n700\n\nAGLS [3]\nHonda [23]\nLipari [24]\nFLUKA [25]\nAnalytic (see Fig. 1a)\n\n600\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n101\n\n102\n\n103\n\n104\n\nE\u03bd (GeV)\nFigure 8: Comparison of three calculations of the vertical flux of atmospheric neutrinos\n(\u03bd\u03bc + \u03bd\u0304\u03bc ) [8, 25, 5].\n\n6\n\nAppendix: Approximate treatment of muon decay and\nenergy loss\n\nFor muons, which lose energy and which may decay in the atmosphere before reaching\nthe ground, we must first multiply by the muon survival probability and take account of\nmuon energy loss between production at depth X and the ground at vertical atmospheric\ndepth X0 \u2248 1030g/cm2 . This is done by multiplying Eq. 1 by the muon survival probability before integrating over the depth, X, of pion (or kaon) decay. The muon survival\nprobability given by Lipari [5] can be rewritten in the form\nP\u03bc (E\u03bc , X, X0 ) =\n\nX cos \u03b8\nE\u03bc\nX0 E\u03bc + \u03b1(X0 / cos \u03b8 \u2212 X)\n\n!\u01eb\u03bc /(E\u03bc cos \u03b8+\u03b1 X0 )\n\n,\n\n(14)\n\nHere E\u03bc is the muon energy at the ground, whereas its energy at production in Eq. 2 is\nE\u03bc,0 = E\u03bc + \u03b1(X0 / cos \u03b8 \u2212 X).\nTo simplify the integration, I make the approximation of replacing X in the expression\nfor E\u03bc,0 and in Eq. 14 by \u039bN \u2248 120 g/cm2 , which is its mean value at low energy (E\u03bc <\nE\u03c0 \u226a \u01eb\u03c0 \u2248 115 GeV). Ionization energy loss is characterized by \u03b1 \u2248 2 MeV/g/cm2 , so\nE\u03bc,0 \u2248 E\u03bc + 2 GeV/cos\u03b8, and the approximate forms will be valid for E\u03bc \u226b 2/ cos \u03b8 GeV,\nin practice, for E\u03bc > 10 GeV for the applications of this paper.\n13\n\n\fFor high energy, ionization energy loss is negligible, but radiative losses due to pair\nproduction, bremsstrahlung, and hadronic interactions of muons begin to become important. However, the radiation lengths are sufficiently large that the probability of significant\nradiative energy losses in the atmosphere is small, and they have been neglected here.\nWith these approximations, we can now follow the same steps used to obtain Eq. 7.\nThe result is\ndN\ndE\u03bc dE\u03c0 dEN\n\n=\n\nS\u03bc (E\u03bc,0 , E\u03c0 ) 1\nFN \u03c0 (E\u03c0 , EN )\n(1 \u2212 r\u03c0 )E\u03c0 E\u03c0\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u221e\nX\n\u039b\u03c0\n(\u2212a\u03c0 )n\u22121\nA(E\u03bc )\nCn (E\u03bc )\n\u03c6(EN ).\n\u03bbN\n1 + nE\u03c0 cos \u03b8/\u01eb\u03c0\nn=1\n\nHere\nA(E\u03bc ) =\n\n1\n\u039b\u03c0 cos \u03b8\nX0 1 + 2/E\u03bc cos \u03b8\n\n(15)\n\n!\u01eb\u03bc /((E\u03bc cos \u03b8+2)\n\nand\n\u01eb\u03bc\nCn = Cn\u22121 \u00d7 1 +\n(n \u2212 1)(E\u03bc cos \u03b8 + 2)\nwith\n\u01eb\u03bc\nC1 = \u0393 1 +\n(E\u03bc cos \u03b8 + 2)\n\n!\n\n!\n\nReferences\n[1] T.K.
