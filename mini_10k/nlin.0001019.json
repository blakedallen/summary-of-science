INTRODUCTION\n\nThe analysis of complex systems by nonlinear deterministic differential equations has attracted much attention in recent years. Given a parameterized differential\nequation, best-fit parameters can be obtained by a leastsquares minimization, see e.g. [1\u20135].\nOften, however, the dynamics does not follow a\nstrict deterministic law. In dissipative systems, due\nto fluctuation-dissipation theorems, thermal noise might\nhave to be taken into account [6]. Furthermore, in open\nnonequilibrium systems like in biology and economy, the\ndynamics is often also exposed to highdimensional, effectively random, influences, see [5] for an example. This\ncalls for a description by nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDE), respectively their corresponding\nFokker-Planck equations [7\u20139]. While parameter estimation in linear stochastic and nonlinear deterministic\ndifferential equations even for data covered by additive\nobservational noise is well known, see [5] for a review, the\nestimation of parameters in nonlinear SDEs is still under\ndevelopment. In this paper we discuss three approaches\nfor parameter estimation in nonlinear SDEs. The results\ncarry over to modeling by Fokker-Planck equations.\nThe organization of this paper is as follows: In the\nnext section, we briefly summarize the theory of integrating SDEs and exemplify its practice for the van der\nPol oscillator undergoing stochastic forcing. In Section\nIII we discuss three approaches for parameter estimation\nin nonlinear stochastic differential equations. In Section\nIV we compare two of these approaches in a simulation\nstudy using the stochastic van der Pol oscillator.\n\n(2)\nwhich is of order 1/2 for multiplicative noise and of order\n1 for additive noise. The\n\u221a characteristics of integration\nschemes for SDEs is the \u03b4t term which results from the\nintegration rules for white noise [11].\nFor the task of parameter estimation, we assume that\nthe system under observation can be adequately described by Eq. (1) with unknown parameter vector ~\u03b8.\nThe process is observed at discrete time points given by\nthe sampling interval \u2206t. For nonlinear deterministic differential equations it is usually possible to chose identical time steps for the integration and the sampling. The\nnecessity of using a low order scheme for SDEs means\nthat the integration step size \u03b4t is usually much smaller\nthan the sampling interval \u2206t by which the time series is\nrecorded. Thus, while Eq. (2) can be written as\n~x(t + \u03b4t) = ~h(~x(t)) + \u03bd(t)\n\n(3)\n\nwith ~h(~x(t)) a function that can be related back to the\nparameter vector ~\u03b8 of ~a(~\u03b8, ~x(t)) and \u03bd(t) uncorrelated\nGaussian noise, on the time scale \u2206t of sampling the\nrelationships are more intricate. While it is still possible\nto formulate the dependence between present and future\nstates as\n~x(t + \u2206t) = ~g(~x(t)) + \u03b7(t)\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\n~ ~x(t)) can, in general, not\nthe parameter vector \u03b8~ of ~a(\u03b8,\nbe inferred from ~g(~x(t)). Furthermore, \u03b7(t), while still\nuncorrelated with zero mean, does in general not represent Gaussian noise. In other words, in nonlinear SDEs\nthe relation between the mean of the conditional density p(~x(t + \u2206t)|~x(t)) and the drift-term ~a(~\u03b8, ~x(t)) is not\nexplicitly known (The analogous problem is given for\nmodeling such systems by their corresponding FokkerPlanck equation). Furthermore, the conditional density\np(~x(t+\u2206t)|~x(t)) is, in general, not Gaussian although ~\u01eb(t)\nin Eqs. (1,2) is Gaussian. For these reasons parameter\nestimation in SDEs is a non-trivial task.\n\nII. INTEGRATING NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC\nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\nA. Theory\n\nA stochastic differential equation (SDE) with parameter vector ~\u03b8 is given by:\n~x \u0307 = ~a(~\n\u03b8, ~x)~\u01eb ,\n\u03b8, ~x) + b(~\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~\u01eb denotes uncorrelated Gaussian noise or, in mathematical terms, the increment of Brownian motion. This\ngeneral form includes additive and multiplicative dynamical noise. ~a(~\u03b8, ~x) is usually denoted as (deterministic)\ndrift term, b(~\u03b8, ~x) is called the diffusion term.\nThe integration of a SDE is not straightforward. This\nis due to the mathematical problems of evaluating integrals which involves the dynamical noise ~\u01eb, see [10]\nfor a brief introduction and [11] for a detailed discussion. Applying the same ideas underlying higher order integration schemes for deterministic differential equation\nlike Runge-Kutta [12] to SDEs leads to hardly treatable\nstochastic integrals given in [9]. Thus, only low order\n\nB. An example\n\nTo exemplify the practical issues of integrating SDEs,\nwe choose the van der Pol oscillator [13]:\n\u1e8d = \u03bc (1 \u2212 x2 ) \u1e8b \u2212 x,\n\n\u03bc > 0.\n\n(5)\n\nThis system exhibits a limit cycle due to the amplitude\ndependent change of the sign of the damping term. We\nexpose it to a random force of unit variance, leading to\n\n2\n\n\f\u1e8b1 = x2\n\u1e8b2 = \u03bc (1 \u2212 x21 ) x2 \u2212 x1 + \u01eb\n\n,\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\nC. A consequence\n\nThe above considerations also have consequences for\nmathematical models used in simulation studies and proposed for analyzing time series in the frame of nonlinear\nstochastic systems by difference equation of the type :\nx1 (t + \u03b4t) = x1 (t) + \u03b4t x2 (t)\n(8)\n\u221a\n2\n+ 1) = f (~\np, x(t), x(t \u2212 1), . . . , x(t \u2212 m)) + \u01eb(t) .\n. (9)\nx2 (t + \u03b4t) = x2 (t) + \u03b4t (\u03bc (1 \u2212 x1 (t)) x2 (t) \u2212 x1 (t)) + \u03b4t \u01eb(t) x(t\n\nwhere x1 denotes the location and x2 the velocity. The\nEuler integration scheme for Eqs. (6,7) is given by\n\n(10)\n\nIn the following we chose \u03bc = 3. To obtain a sampled\ntime series of the system, one has to decide on \u03b4t and \u2206t.\n\u2206t should be chosen so that the process is reasonably\nsampled. Characteristics of the stochastic van der Pol\noscillator and related perturbed limit cycles have been\ninvestigated in [14,15]. These authors have shown that\nthe mean period of this system is slightly smaller than the\nperiod of the corresponding deterministic system which\nis approximately 9 s. By choosing \u2206t = 0.5, we obtain\napproximately 18 data points per mean period.\nThe choice of the integration step size \u03b4t is more difficult. For deterministic systems adaptive algorithms\nare well established that guarantee an upper bound for\nthe deviation from the true trajectory [12]. No corresponding straightforward procedure is available for SDEs.\nFor SDEs the characteristic quantities are the conditional densities p(~x(t + \u2206t)|~x(t)). To obtain a sampled\ntrajectory that can be regarded as a realization of the\nSDE, \u03b4t has to be chosen such small that the conditional\ndensities become independent of \u03b4t for smaller values.\nFigs. 1 and 2 shows this procedure for the first component of ~x(t + \u2206t) of the stochastic van der Pol oscillator denoted by x1 (t + \u2206t) for the two state vectors\n~x(t) = (\u22120.0935, \u22124.284) and ~x(t) = (1.021, \u22120.9375).\nThe conditional densities p(x1 (t + \u2206t)|~xi (t)) were estimated by triangular kernel estimators [16] based on 5000\nintegrations of the SDE. The quality of these estimated\ndensities with respect to bias and variance depends on the\nwidth of the kernel. By visual inspection, the width of\nthe kernel was chosen equal to 0.02 in Fig. 1 and equal to\n0.1 in Fig. 2. In Fig. 1, the estimated conditional density\nchanges drastically between \u03b4t = 0.1s and \u03b4t = 0.01s. It\nbecomes independent from \u03b4t for \u03b4t = 0.001s. In Fig. 2,\nthis already happens for \u03b4t = 0.01s. The reason for the\ndifferent behavior is that the time evolution in the first\ncase experiences more of the nonlinearity of the system.\nBy investigating numerous analogous simulations, we regarded \u03b4t = 0.001s as an appropriate integration time\nstep. The two state space vectors ~x(t) used for the above\nsimulation were realizations of the trajectory obtained\nwith \u03b4t = 0.001s. Thus, the procedure for determining\n\u03b4t is an interactive one that has to be selfconsistent.\nFig. 3 shows a realization of the stochastic van der Pol\noscillator with \u03bc = 3, \u03b4t = 0.001 and \u2206t = 0.5. The two\ndata points marked by arrows at time 28s, respectively\n28.5s were used for the estimation of the conditional densities shown in Figs. 1 and 2.\n\nHere the sampling interval is set to unity, \u01eb(t) denotes\nuncorrelated Gaussian noise, ~p the parameters and m\nthe order of the model, see e.g. [17]. For these models\nthe conditional distribution of x(t + 1) given the history\nis Gaussian. Due to the Gaussianity, least squares optimization leads to a maximum likelihood estimation of\nthe parameters which is asymptotically unbiased and efficient [18,19]. Figs. 1 and 2 show that for difference\nequations that are thought to be discretized versions of\nSDEs, the dynamical noise should be non-Gaussian, see\nthe skewed distribution in Fig. 2, and state dependent\nheteroscadistic. It might even be multimodal.\nIII. PARAMETER ESTIMATION\n\nIn this section we discuss three methods to estimate\nparameters in SDEs. Due to its superior statistical properties, the most desirable method would be a maximum\nlikelihood estimation [18,19]. We argue that this approach is not feasible. Then we discuss recently suggested quasi-maximum likelihood approaches [20]. The\nthird approach applies the integration scheme, Eq. (2),\nfor the whole sampling interval by using \u2206t = \u03b4t. With\nrespect to the identification of the two time scales this\nlast approach is similar to a procedure to estimate parameters in SDEs proposed in [21\u201323]. In the simulation\nstudies presented in these publications the time series\nwere sampled at the time step of integration.\nTo simplify the exposition, we consider a scalar dynamics and a single parameter \u03b8 in the following.\n\nA. Maximum likelihood estimation\n\nDenoting the stationary distribution of the SDE for a\ngiven parameter \u03b8 by \u03c0(x|\u03b8), the likelihood for a sampled\ntime series of length N reads :\nL(x(t1 ), x(t2 ), . . . , x(tN ); \u03b8) = \u03c0(x(t1 )|\u03b8)\n\nN\n\u22121\nY\n\np(x(ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8)\n\ni=1\n\n(11)\nMaximizing L(.; \u03b8) leads to an estimator \u03b8\u0302 that is\nasymptotically unbiased and has least conservative confidence regions. Note that a biased estimator can lead\n3\n\n.\n\n\fto erroneous interpretations of results, while suboptimal\nconfidence regions 'only' lowers the power to reject simpler models in favor of more complex ones, but does not\nlead to statistically false positive results.\nUsually, the logarithm of the likelihood is considered\nand the term \u03c0(x(t1 )|\u03b8) whose influence vanishes asymptotically is neglected:\nL(x(t2 ), x(t3 ), . . . , x(tN )|\u03b8) =\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\nshows that the loss in optimality is often rather small [26].\nEq. (14) is called estimation equation, and the resulting\nestimator is called quasi maximum likelihood estimator.\nBibby and Sorensen [20] have shown that in the case\nof SDEs one possible choice for G(\u03b8) is given by:\nG(\u03b8) =\n\ni=1\n\n, (15)\n\nwhere gi (.) is a function that is derived from the SDE\nand E(x(ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8) denotes the expected value of\nx(ti+1 ) conditioned on the observed x(ti ) for a given \u03b8.\nDifferent possible procedures for deriving gi (.) given the\nSDE are discussed in [20].\nIn opposite to the conditional density necessary for the\nmaximum likelihood case, the conditional expectation in\nEq. (15) can the estimated reliably with a comparable\nsmall numbers of integrations in the intervals [ti , ti+1 ]\nstarting from the observed x(ti ).\n\n(12)\nThe maximum likelihood estimator \u03b8\u0302mle is defined by:\nd\nL(x(t2 ), x(t3 ), . . . , x(tN ); \u03b8) = 0\nd\u03b8\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nTo obtain \u03b8\u0302mle an iterative optimization strategy has\nto be applied. Starting from an initial guess for the parameter, the conditional densities p(x(ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8) in\nEq. (12) have to be estimated and evaluated. This can\nbe achieved by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck\nequation or by applying the integration scheme, Eq. (2),\nwith the actual guess of the parameters several times on\nthe intervals [ti , ti+1 ] starting from the observed x(ti ) to\nestimate the conditional density, e.g. by kernel estimation\n[16]. Then, the log-likelihood can be calculated. Based\non this procedure, the parameter is changed until the loglikelihood is extremal by applying some optimization algorithm [12]. The performance of this procedure depends\nheavily on the quality of the density estimation. Thus, for\nthe procedure based on integrating the SDE thousands\nof trajectories in each interval [ti1 , ti ] have to be realized. Note that the densities shown in Figs. 1 and 2 that\nwere based on 5000 realizations are not smooth enough\nto enable a numerically stable estimation of the parameters. Furthermore, this procedure involves the choice of\na parameter determining the bandwidth of the density\nestimator. This parameter has to be chosen data driven\nand state dependent, e.g. by a computer intensive crossvalidation procedure [16,24,25]. Therefore, the desirable\nmethod of maximum likelihood is hardly applicable.\n\nC. \"\u2206t = \u03b4t\" approach\n\nIn the third approach we use the discretization scheme,\nEq. (2), on the interval of the whole sampling time step\n\u2206t by setting \u2206t = \u03b4t in Eq. (2). This yields an estimate\nx\nb((ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8). The parameters are adjusted until the\nmean square error\nN\n\u22121\nX\ni=1\n\n(x(ti+1 ) \u2212 x\nb((ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8))2\n\n(16)\n\nis minimized. This method neglects the existence of the\ntwo time scales for integrating and sampling SDEs. Furthermore, it implicitly assumes that the variance of the\nconditional density is state space independent and Gaussian.\nIV. SIMULATION STUDY\n\nWe investigate the behavior of the quasi maximum likelihood and the \"\u2206t = \u03b4t\" approach in a simulation study\nusing the stochastic van der Pol oscillator introduced in\nSection II B. We integrated the process with \u03b4t = 0.001s.\nThe smaller the sampling time, the smaller the differences\nbetween ~h(.) in Eq. (3) and ~g(.) in Eq. (4) will be. Thus,\nthe less severe the effects of ignoring the two time scales\nby the \"\u2206t = \u03b4t\" approach will be [27\u201329]. Therefore, we\ninvestigate the behavior of the two approaches described\nabove for different sampling times between \u2206t = 0.005s\nand \u2206t = 0.5s. As in the simulation study presented\nin [23], we assume that the whole state space vector is\nobserved.\nFor the quasi maximum likelihood approach, Section\nIII B, we chose the term gi (.) in Eq. (15) to be:\n\nB. Quasi maximum likelihood estimation\n\nBibby and Sorensen [20] suggested to use a quasi maximum likelihood estimator instead of the infeasible maximum likelihood estimator, Eq. (13). The key idea of\nthis procedure is that Eq. (13) can formally be read as a\nsearch for a root :\n,\n\ngi (.) (x(ti+1 ) \u2212 E(x(ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8))\n\nln p(x(ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8) .\n\ni=1\n\nG(\u03b8) = 0\n\nN\n\u22121\nX\n\n(14)\n\ndefining an estimator \u03b8\u0302. By virtue of choosing G(\u03b8),\nthe resulting computationally feasible estimator can be\nforced to be unbiased by paying the price that the resulting confidence region are no longer optimal. Experience\n4\n\n\fgi (~x(ti )) = (1 \u2212 x21 ) x2\n\n,\n\nIt might become tractable with the advent of more powerful massive parallel computers. In the presented simulation study, the quasi maximum likelihood approach\nyielded unbiased estimates for the parameter. Disregarding the existence of the two time scales of integration and\nof sampling in SDEs and using the discretization scheme\nof the SDE itself on the time scale of the sampling led to\nresults that are unbiased only for the case of heavy oversampling, but biased for conventional sampling rates.\nThus, methods that require the sampling time interval\nto be an admissable integration time step, like suggested\nin [21,22], are applicable to measured time series only for\nsufficiently sampled data. The same holds for the desirable approach to nonparametrically estimate the complete functional form of the deterministic drift term of a\nstochastic differential equation based on the discretization of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation proposed in [23] where formally even the limit \"sampling\ninterval \u2192 0\" is required.\nThe approaches discussed in this paper require to observe the complete state space vector which is usually not\npossible. Our future work will concentrate on the generalization to the case of parameter estimation in nonlinear\nstochastic differential equations based on scalar observations as it is already possible in linear stochastic and\nnonlinear deterministic systems [5].\n\n(17)\n\ngeneralizing the line of argument of [20]. The term\n\"(x(ti+1 ) \u2212 E(x(ti+1 )|x(ti ), \u03b8)\" in Eq. (15) is read as\n(x1 (ti+1 ) \u2212 E(x1 (ti+1 )|~x(ti ), \u03b8). Thus, we predict the observed location x1 (ti+1 ) based on the whole state space\nvector at the present time step ti . The expected value of\nx1 (ti+1 ) is estimated based on 50 integrations. Finding\nthe zero of Eq. (15) is performed by routines from [12].\nFor the \"\u2206t = \u03b4t\" approach, Section III C, we use the\ninformation from the whole state space from the history\nand from the present state. The minimization is perform\nby routines from [12].\nFig. 4 displays the results of the simulation study for\nsampling time steps \u2206t ranging from 0.005 to 0.5. The 2\u03c3\nconfidence intervals were calculated from 50 repetitions.\nThe length of the time series for different sampling times\nwere chosen such that 1000 data points enters the estimation. The quasi maximum likelihood approach yields\nunbiased results independent from the sampling interval.\nFor realistic sampling intervals the \"\u2206t = \u03b4t\" approach\ngives strongly biased results. Only for a sampling time\nof \u2206t \u2264 0.025 its estimate is consistent with the true parameter. This would require to sample the process with\napproximately 360 points per period. Note that classical time series like the sunspot data and the Canadian\nlynx data are sampled with 11, respectively 10 points per\nperiod, see e.g. [30].\nFig. 5 shows the results analogous to Fig. 4 for nonlinearity parameter \u03bc = 5. The relative bias of the \"\u2206t =\n\u03b4t\" approach for sampling intervals \u03b4t = 0.05s, 0.1s and\n0.5s is larger than for \u03bc = 3 due to the higher degree of\nnonlinearity. Thus, in general, a sufficient sampling for\nthe linearly approximating \"\u2206t = \u03b4t\" approach to work\ndepends on the degree of nonlinearity.\n\n[1] H.

DISCUSSION\n\nModeling time series of open nonequilibrium systems\nby nonlinear stochastic differential equations (SDE) allows to take into account the effects of the huge number\nof degrees of freedom that might be active in such systems. A fundamental problem in estimating parameters\nin SDEs is taught by the theory of integrating nonlinear\nstochastic differential equations. A central message from\nthis theory is that there are in general two time scales:\nthat of integration and that of sampling. As a consequence, the mean and the distributional characteristics\nof conditional densities on the time scale of sampling can,\nin general, not be related back to the parameters of the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE).\nWe discussed three approaches for parameter estimation in SDEs based on sampled time series. Unfortunately, the desirable maximum likelihood approach is not\nfeasible in the present context due to its extreme computational burden to estimate the conditional distributions.\n\n5\n\n\faround the applied sampling time steps \u2206t =\n0.005s, 0.01s, 0.025s, 0.05s, 0.1s and 0.5s. The true\nvalue of the parameter \u03bc = 3 is marked by the solid\nline.\n\n[15] H. Leung, Physica A 221, 340 (1995).\n[16] B.
