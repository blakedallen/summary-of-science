It is widely recognized in\nthe hole-doped high-Tc cuprates that the suppression of\nthe superconductivity through the substitution of magnetic impurities such as Ni for Cu is weaker than through\nthe substitution of nonmagnetic impurities such as Zn\nfor Cu, [1, 2] which is a trend opposite to that observed in conventional superconductors.

[4] The so-called dynamical stripe\ncorrelations of spins and holes in the CuO2 plane [5] observed in La-based high-Tc cuprates tend to be pinned\nand stabilized by Zn more effectively than by Ni. [6\u20138]\nThese contrasting behaviors suggest that Ni has weak\ninfluence on the electronic and magnetic states in the\nCuO2 plane. In recent years, moreover, neutron scattering, [9, 10] magnetization, [11] muon spin relaxation\n(\u03bcSR), [12] X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) [13]\nexperiments and a theoretical work using the numerical\nexact diagonalization calculation [14] have suggested that\na hole tends to be bound around a Ni impurity, leading\nto the decrease of the effective hole-concentration. That\nis, a Ni2+ ion with the spin quantum number S = 1 tends\nto trap a hole, forming a Ni2+ ion with a ligand hole, i.e.,\na so-called Zhang-Rice doublet state (the effective value\nof S is 1/2) so as not to disturb the antiferromagnetic\n(AF) correlation between Cu2+ spins with S = 1/2 so\nmuch. These suggest that Ni is no longer regarded as an\nusual magnetic impurity in the high-Tc cuprates.\nThe above new concept of hole-trapping by Ni may pin\n\n\f2\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nPolycrystalline samples of LSCNO with x = 0.08\u22120.30\nand y = 0\u22120.10 were prepared by the ordinary solid-state\nreaction method. [8] All of the samples were checked by\nthe powder X-ray diffraction to be of the single phase.\nSpecific-heat measurements were carried out by the thermal relaxation method in zero magnetic field and 9 T at\nlow temperatures down to 0.4 K, using a commercial ap-\n\n30\n\n40\n\n(a) La2-xSrxCu1-yNiyO4 y = 0.05\n\n(b) y = 0.10\n30\n\n20\n\nx = 0.30\n\nCtot/T (mJ/K2 mol)\n\ndown the issue whether or not a quantum critical point\n(QCP) resides in the superconducting (SC) region on the\nphase diagram of high-Tc cuprates. It has been pointed\nout that the magnitude of the pseudo gap decreases with\nincreasing hole-concentration per Cu, p, and seems to\nvanish at p \u223c 0.19. [15] Moreover, the electrical resistivity, \u03c1, has exhibited a T -linear behavior above Tc in a very\nlimited region near the optimally doped regime, suggesting the existence of a quantum critical region. [16\u201318] To\ninvestigate the quantum phase transition, the SC state\nconcealing the normal ground state has to be removed.\nIn the La-based cuprate La2\u2212x Srx CuO4 (LSCO) where\nthe superconductivity is suppressed by the application of\nhigh magnetic field, in fact, it has been suggested that\nthe quantum critical region deduced from the T -linear\nbehavior of \u03c1 seems not to converge at a singular point\nof p in the ground state as in the case of a conventional\nquantum phase transition, but seems to spread out over\na wide range of p in the overdoped regime at low temperatures. [19] In Zn-substituted La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Zny O4\n(LSCZO) where the superconductivity is suppressed by\nZn, on the other hand, \u03bcSR measurements [20] have\nrevealed that the development of the Cu-spin correlation through the Zn substitution is weakened gradually\nwith increasing p in the overdoped regime and disappears\naround x = 0.30 where the superconductivity in LSCO\ndisappears, suggesting that QCP in the viewpoint of the\nCu-spin correlation [21] is not located simply at p \u223c 0.19\nbut is extended in the overdoped regime due to the presence of a phase separation into short-range magnetically\nordered and metallic regions. Both high magnetic field\nand Zn suppressing the superconductivity, however, may\naffect the Cu-spin correlation which is probably indispensable to the appearance of HTSC. Therefore, the exploration of QCP in La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Niy O4 (LSCNO) in\nwhich the superconductivity is suppressed by Ni attracts\ngreat interest.\nIn this paper, specific heat, \u03c1, magnetization and\n\u03bcSR measurements have been carried out to investigate\nthe electronic state in the normal state of non-SC Nisubstituted LSCNO in a wide range of x and y. [22, 23]\nIn particular, we have focused on the temperaturedependent change of the hole dynamics from the underdoped to overdoped regime in order to obtain a whole\naspect of the electronic state in the normal state, because only separated results in limited ranges of p and\ntemperature have been reported so far.

Data of x = 0.23, 0.30 and y = 0.10 in a magnetic field\nof 9 T are also indicated by crosses. The inset shows the\ntemperature dependence of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T in Zn-substituted\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Zny O4 with x = 0.10, 0.13 and y = 0.02.\nArrows indicate the magnetic transition temperature, TN , estimated from \u03bcSR measurements. [12, 26]\n\nFor T 2 \u2264 30 K2 , on the other hand, it is found that\nCtot /T tends to deviate upward or downward from the\nT 2 -dependence, suggesting an anomalous change of Cel\nat low temperatures.\nAfter removing the phonon contribution from the total specific heat to investigate the anomalous deviation\nat low temperatures in detail, the temperature dependence of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T for LSCNO with y = 0.05 and\n0.10 is shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. Here,\nCph was estimated from the fit of the data in the temperature range of 30 K2 \u2264 T 2 \u2264 50 K2 in Fig. 1\nto Eq. (3.1). For all the samples, (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T is\nfound to be almost constant above 5 K, while it sig-\n\nnificantly varies depending on x below 5 K. Here, we\ndefine the effective hole-concentration per Cu, peff , in\na sample as peff = x \u2212 y, which is reasonable in the\ncase that a Ni2+ ion traps a hole. For low-peff samples\nof (x, y) = (0.08 \u2212 0.13, 0.05) and (0.13 \u2212 0.18, 0.10),\n(Ctot \u2212Cph )/T decreases with decreasing temperature below 5 K, while it increases below 5 K for high-peff samples\nof (x, y) = (0.20 \u2212 0.30, 0.05) and (0.25 \u2212 0.30, 0.10). For\nintermediate-peff samples of (x, y) = (0.15 \u2212 0.18, 0.05)\nand (0.20\u22120.23, 0.10), (Ctot \u2212Cph )/T once increases with\ndecreasing temperature and then decreases below 5 K.\nTherefore, the behavior of (Ctot \u2212Cph )/T at low temperatures are summarized to exhibit a gradual crossover from\nthe decrease to increase with increasing x. It is noted\nthat a small upturn of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T around the lowest\ntemperature observed for (x, y) = (0.08 \u2212 0.13, 0.05) and\n(0.13 \u2212 0.15, 0.10) is probably due to the so-called Schottky anomaly often observed in high-Tc cuprates. [24]\nTo make quantitative discussion about Cel , values of\n(Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T before and after the change around 5 K\nare defined as \u03b3HT and \u03b3LT , respectively, and plotted\nin Fig. 3(a). Concretely, \u03b3HT is defined as the averaged\nvalue of (Ctot \u2212Cph )/T at 5\u22127 K for all the samples. The\n\u03b3LT for (x, y) = (0.08 \u2212 0.13, 0.05) and (0.13 \u2212 0.15, 0.10)\nexhibiting the Schottky anomaly is defined as the minimum value at low temperatures below 1 K and \u03b3LT\nfor the other samples of (x, y) = (0.15 \u2212 0.30, 0.05) and\n(0.18\u22120.30, 0.10) is defined as the value of (Ctot \u2212Cph )/T\nat the lowest temperature of 0.4 K. Normal-state values of \u03b3, \u03b3N , in Ni-free LSCO obtained by Momono and\nIdo [25] is also plotted for comparison. It is found that\n\u03b3HT is in approximate agreement with \u03b3N at each x.\nThis indicates that values of \u03b3 are dependent on the\nSr-concentration x irrespective of the Ni-concentration\ny at high temperatures above 5 K. Therefore, in comparison with the other experimental results suggesting\nthe occurrence of hole-trapping by Ni at high temperatures, [9, 10, 13] the present results indicate that the\n\n\f4\n\nT (K)\n100\n\n10\n\n5\n\n2\n\n1\n\n(0.20\u22120.30, 0.10), \u03b3LT is apparently larger than \u03b3N owing\nto the enhancement of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T at low temperatures below 5 K. The enhancement of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T is\nreminiscent of the Kondo effect. [27] As shown in Fig.\n2(b), in fact, the enhancement of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T at low\ntemperatures for (x, y) = (0.23, 0.10) and (0.30, 0.10) is\nsuppressed by the application of a magnetic field of 9\nT, which is also a typical behavior in the Kondo state.\nTherefore, high-peff samples with Ni impurities are interpreted as being in a Kondo-like state at low temperatures below 5 K. As for intermediate-peff samples of\n(x, y) = (0.15 \u2212 0.18, 0.05) and (0.20 \u2212 0.23, 0.10), the\nenhancement of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T with decreasing temperature is followed by the decrease below \u223c 1 K. This is\nregarded as a crossover of the electronic state from the\nKondo-like state to the strong hole-trapping state with\ndecreasing temperature.\n\n0.5\n\n20\n\nLa2-xSrxCu1-yNiyO4\n1.2\n1.0\n\n15\nln\u03c1\n\n0.6\n\nT\n0.4\n\nln\u03c1\n\nx = 0.13 , y = 0.05\nx = 0.20 , y = 0.07\nx = 0.15 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.18 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.20 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.23 , y = 0.10\n\nx = 0.20,\ny = 0.07\n\n0.8\n\nVRH\n\n0.2\n\n10\n\n0\n\nx = 0.23, y = 0.10\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 1.4\n\nT\n\n5\n\n-1/3\n\n(K-1/3)\n\nTVRH\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nT-1/3 (K-1/3)\nFIG. 4: (color online) Temperature dependence of the\nelectrical resistivity, \u03c1, plotted as ln \u03c1 vs.\nT \u22121/3 for\nLa2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Niy O4 with y = 0.05, 0.07 and 0.10.

Arrows indicate TVRH\nbelow which ln \u03c1 changes linearly to T \u22121/3 .\n\ncomplete hole-trapping by Ni does not take place at high\ntemperatures above 5 K.\nOn the other hand, \u03b3LT appears to disagree with \u03b3N at\neach x. Figure 3(b) shows the dependence on peff of \u03b3LT\nand \u03b3N . It is found that \u03b3LT is in approximate agreement\nwith \u03b3N for low-peff samples of (x, y) = (0.08 \u2212 0.15, 0.05)\nand (0.13 \u2212 0.18, 0.10), suggesting that the strong holetrapping by Ni2+ takes place resulting in the effective\ndecrease of the hole-concentration in these samples at\nlow temperatures below 5 K.\nIt is possible that the decrease in (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T with\ndecreasing temperature at low temperatures below 5 K\nis simply caused by the reduction of DOS at the Fermi\nlevel accompanied by the formation of a magnetic order,\nnot accompanied by the strong hole-trapping by Ni2+ .\nTo check the possibility, the temperature dependence of\nthe specific heat was measured for Zn-substituted LSCZO\nwith x = 0.10, 0.13 and y = 0.02, in which a stripe-like\nmagnetic order is formed at low temperatures below TN\nestimated from \u03bcSR measurements, [26] as shown in the\ninset of Fig. 2(a). It is found that no significant decrease\nin (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T is observed below TN , suggesting that\nthe observed decrease in (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T with decreasing\ntemperature at low temperatures below 5 K for LSCNO is\nirrelevant to the magnetically induced reduction of DOS.\nFor high-peff samples of (x, y) = (0.18 \u2212 0.30, 0.05) and\n\nB.\n\nElectrical resistivity\n\nFigure 4 shows the temperature dependence of \u03c1 plotted as ln\u03c1 vs. T \u22121/3 for (x, y) = (0.13, 0.05), (0.20, 0.07)\nand (0.15 \u2212 0.23, 0.10). Linear behaviors are observed at\nlow temperatures below TVRH shown by arrows for all the\nsamples, suggesting the occurrence of two-dimensional\n(2D) variable-range hopping (VRH) conduction. As \u03c1\nexhibits a metallic behavior at high temperatures for\n(x, y) = (0.13, 0.05), (0.20, 0.07) and (0.18 \u2212 0.23, 0.10),\nit is suggested for low-peff samples that holes tend to be\nlocalized gradually with decreasing temperature and turn\ninto a strongly localized state exhibiting VRH conduction\nbelow TVRH .\nFigure 5(a) shows the temperature dependence of \u03c1 for\n(x, y) = (0.30, 0.05), (0.20, 0.07) and (0.23\u22120.30, 0.10). It\nis found that the samples except for (x, y) = (0.30, 0.05)\nexhibit logarithmic temperature-dependence below 5\u221210\nK and following saturation below 1 \u2212 2 K. As shown\nin Fig. 5(b), moreover, negative magnetoresistance is\nobserved at low temperatures where the logarithmic\ntemperature-dependence of \u03c1 is observed. These are\ncharacteristic of a Kondo state and/or a 2D Andersonlocalized state. In these samples, in fact, a behavior characteristic of a Kondo state is observed also in the specific\nheat measurements, as described in Sec. III A. Therefore, the logarithmic temperature-dependence of \u03c1 in zero\nfield is interpreted as being due to the occurrence of the\nKondo-like state, namely, due to screening of localized\nNi2+ spins by mobile holes.\nFor (x, y) = (0.23, 0.10), it is found that the logarithmic increase in \u03c1 with decreasing temperature tends to\nbe saturated around 1 \u2212 2 K and then increases again\nbelow 1 K. The saturated behavior of \u03c1 may be regarded\nas the one toward the unitary limit of the Kondo state.\nTo understand the increase below 1 K, however, another mechanism is required, as discussed later. It is\nnoted for (x, y) = (0.30, 0.05) that no logarithmic increase in \u03c1 is observed at low temperatures, although\n\n\f5\n1.0\n\n4.0\n\n(a) La Sr Cu Ni O\n2-x\n\n3.5\n\nx\n\n1-y\n\n4\n\n(b) y = 0.10\n1.0\n\ny = 0.05\n\n0.8\n\n2.0\n\nM / H (10-3 emu/mol)\n\n2.5\n\nS\n\n0.6\n\nx = 0.30 , y = 0.05\nx = 0.20 , y = 0.07\nx = 0.23 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.25 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.27 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.28 , y = 0.10\nx = 0.30 , y = 0.10\n\n3.0\n\n\u03c1 (m\u03a9cm)\n\ny\n\n2\n\n(a) La2-xSrxCu1-yNiyO4\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n0.2\nx (Sr)\n\n0\n\n0.22\n\n0\n0\n\n0.18\n\n0\n0\n\nTN\n\n0\n0\n\nH=1T\n\n0.15\n\nTN\nH = 1T\n\n0.08\n\n0\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0\n1000 1\n\n0.3\n\nx=\n0.30\n0.25\n\n0.25\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\ny = 0.10\n\n0.2\n\nx=\n0.30\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n1.5\n\nS = 1/2\n\n0.6\n0.4 y = 0.05\n\n1\n\n0.23\n0.20\n0.18\n0.15\n0.13\n\n10\n\nT (K)\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nT (K)\n\n0.5\nFIG. 6: (color online) Temperature dependence of the magnetization divided by the magnetic field, M/H, in a magnetic\nfield of 1 T for La2\u2212x Srx Cu1\u2212y Niy O4 with (a) y = 0.05 and\n(b) y = 0.10.

The data are shifted top\nand bottom. The characteristics are as follows. (i) All the\nsamples exhibit Curie-like behavior more or less. (ii) For\n(x, y) = (0.08 \u2212 0.18, 0.05) and (0.13 \u2212 0.20, 0.10), downward deviation of M/H from the Curie-like behavior is\nobserved at low temperatures below \u223c 10 K. (iii) The\nM/H due to the so-called 2D-AF correlation between\nCu2+ spins, [28] \u03c7AF , is invisible for all the samples, because probably the variation of the Curie-like M/H with\ntemperature is much larger than that of \u03c7AF in the mea-\n\nsured temperature-range.\nThe temperature dependence of M/H is fitted using\nthe following equation;\nM/H = \u03c70 + \u03c7AF + C/(T \u2212 \u03b8).\n\n(3.2)\n\nThe first term represents a temperature-independent one\noriginating from the van Vleck paramagnetism, ion-core\ndiamagnetism, etc. The third term is a Curie-Weiss one\ndue to Ni2+ spins. The \u03b8 is the Weiss temperature and\nC the Curie constant given by\nC = N g 2 S(S + 1)\u03bc2B /3kB .\n\n(3.3)\n\nHere, N is the number of Ni2+ spins, g the g-factor,\n\u03bcB the Bohr magneton and kB the Boltzmann constant.\nEarly measurements of M/H in LSCNO by Xiao et al. [2]\nhave suggested that the Curie-like behavior is caused by\nthe substituted Ni2+ spins.\nFor underdoped and highly Ni-substituted samples\nof LSCNO, it has been reported that \u03c7AF exhibits a\nbroad maximum above room temperature and monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature below room\ntemperature, [28] allowing us to express \u03c7AF being linearly dependent on temperature. For optimally doped\nand overdoped samples of LSCNO, on the other hand,\nthe broad maximum in \u03c7AF has been observed below\nroom temperature. [28] In fact, the fitting of the data of\n(x, y) = (0.15 \u2212 0.30, 0.05) to Eq. (3.2) in which \u03c7AF\nis linearly dependent on temperature has failed. On\nthe other hand, the data of (x, y) = (0.08, 0.05) and\n(0.13 \u2212 0.30, 0.10) have been fitted to Eq. (3.2) at high\ntemperatures above TN , as shown in Fig. 6.

[23]\nTSB is defined as the temperature below which (Ctot \u2212Cph )/T\ndecreases with decreasing temperature. TKondo is the onset\ntemperature of the Kondo-like state where (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T\nincreases with decreasing temperature. TVRH is defined as\nthe onset temperature of the variable-range hopping conduction. The magnetic transition temperature, TN , estimated\nfrom \u03bcSR measurements [12] is also plotted, together with\nthe reported data of y = 0. [29] Dashed lines are to guide the\nreader's eye.\n\nvalues of S using Eq. (3.3) are plotted in the inset of Fig.\n6. It is found that the values of S are between 0.1 and 0.3\nand much smaller than the expected value of S = 1 in the\nNi2+ state. This suggests that holes tend to be localized\naround Ni2+ forming Zhang-Rice doublet states even at\nhigh temperatures for comparatively low-peff samples, so\nthat each Ni2+ spin is antiferromagnetically coupled with\na hole-spin, resulting in the decrease in S of Ni2+ spins.\nIt is noted that the smaller values of S than 1/2 expected\nfrom the AF coupling between a Ni2+ spin with S = 1\nand a hole-spin with S = 1/2 may be due to the mixing\nof Ni 3d and O 2p orbitals.\nAs to the downward deviation of M/H from the Curielike behavior at low temperatures for comparatively lowpeff samples, the onset temperature of the deviation of\nM/H is found to be in rough agreement with TN estimated from \u03bcSR measurements. [12] This suggests that\nthe deviation of M/H is due to the development of the\nmagnetic correlation between Ni2+ and Cu2+ spins toward the formation of a magnetic order.\n\nFigure 7 displays the phase diagram of LSCNO, in\nwhich the temperatures where (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T shown in\nFig. 2 starts to decrease and increase with decreasing\ntemperature, TSB and TKondo , respectively, the temperature below which \u03c1 shown in Fig. 4 exhibits VRH conduction, TVRH , are plotted as a function of peff . For\nhigh-peff samples, it is unclear whether or not holes tend\nto be localized around Ni2+ at high temperatures, so that\npeff may be meaningless. In the Kondo-like state at low\ntemperatures, on the other hand, holes are localized in\nthe ground state so as to screen Ni2+ spins, so that peff\nis meaningful at low temperatures.\nIn Fig. 7, TN estimated from \u03bcSR measurements [12]\nis also plotted, together with the reported data of y =\n0. [29] For peff < 0.10, a long-range magnetic order is\nformed in the ground state, confirmed by the muon-spin\nprecession. For peff \u2265 0.10, on the other hand, both\nthe presence of fast depolarization of muon spins and\nthe absence of muon-spin precession at low temperatures\nsuggest the formation of a short-range magnetic order,\nwhich is discussed later. It is found that TSB is in good\nagreement with TN , suggesting that the decrease in the\nelectronic specific heat at low temperatures is deeply related to the formation of the magnetic order. That is,\nsupposed that a hole is strongly bound by a Ni2+ ion,\nthe effective value of S of the Ni2+ ion with a ligand hole\nis regarded as being roughly the same as that of Cu2+\nspins, tending to the recovery of the S = 1/2 network\nof Cu2+ spins. [14] Moreover, the strong hole-trapping\nby a Ni2+ ion is expected to reduce the frustration effect\nbetween Cu2+ spins. Therefore, it is guessed that each\nNi2+ ion traps a hole strongly so as not to disturb the\nAF correlation in the network of Cu2+ spins.\n\nB.\n\nTemperature dependence of the electronic state\nin the underdoped regime\n\nHere, we discuss the temperature-dependent change\nof the electronic state in the underdoped regime, as\nschematically shown in Fig. 8. In the case of x > y, that\nis, p is larger than the Ni-concentration, y, there exist two\nkinds of hole in the CuO2 plane; one is weakly localized\naround Ni2+ forming a Zhang-Rice doublet state and the\nother is mobile forming a Zhang-Rice singlet state with\nCu2+ spins at room temperature, as shown in Fig. 8(a).\nIt has been suggested from XAFS experiments by Hiraka\net al. [13] that holes tend to be localized around Ni even\nat room temperature. The present result of M/H that\nthe value of S of Ni2+ spins is much smaller than 1 suggests the localization of holes around Ni2+ at high temperatures. On the other hand, relatively good conduction occurs at high temperatures, judged from \u03c1 shown\n\n\f7\nshown in Fig. 6 and by the good coincidence of \u03b3HT with\n\u03b3N at each x.\nWith further decreasing temperature, each Ni2+ ion\nstrongly traps a hole, resulting in the formation of the\nmagnetic order of Cu2+ spins and in the decrease in\n(Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T at low temperatures below TN \u223c TSB ,\nas shown in Fig. 8(c). Below TN , moreover, the suppression of M/H is observed due to the participation of\nNi2+ spins in the AF order of Cu2+ spins. No significant anomaly is detected in \u03c1 around TSB , implying that\nthe state of holes except for ones around Ni2+ does not\nchange so much.\n\nC.\n\nFIG. 8: (color online) Schematic drawing of the CuO2 plane\n(a) in the underdoped regime at high temperatures of T >\nTVRH where both weakly localized holes around Ni2+ and itinerant holes exist, (b) in the underdoped regime at T < TVRH\nwhere localized holes exhibit variable-range hopping conduction, (c) in the underdoped regime at low temperatures below\nTN \u223c TSB where holes are strongly bound by Ni2+ , (d) in the\noverdoped regime at low temperatures below TKondo where\nscreening of localized Ni2+ spins by conducting holes takes\nplace forming a Kondo-like state.\n\nin Fig. 4. These results naturally draw the conclusion\nthat the two kinds of hole, namely, weakly localized holes\naround Ni2+ forming a Zhang-Rice doublet state and mobile holes forming a Zhang-Rice singlet state with Cu2+\nspins reside in the CuO2 plane at high temperatures.\nAs shown in Fig. 8(b), mobile holes moving around\nin the CuO2 plane at high temperatures tend to be localized below TVRH , leading to the occurrence of VRH\nconduction. On the other hand, holes around Ni2+ are\nmaintained in its original form, supported by the constant value of S in the moderate range of temperature as\n\nTemperature dependence of the electronic state\nin the overdoped regime\n\nIn the overdoped regime, \u03c1 exhibits a metallic behavior at high temperatures. At low temperatures below\nTKondo , on the other hand, Kondo-like behavior is observed in the specific heat and \u03c1 measurements. In this\ncase, mobile holes are scattered by Ni2+ spins, leading to\nthe screening of the Ni2+ spins toward the ground state,\nas shown in Fig. 8(d). It attracts interest that the ground\nstate of the Kondo-like state due to Ni2+ spins in the\noverdoped regime is more or less analogous to the holetrapping state due to Ni2+ in the underdoped regime.\nVery recently, a logarithmic increase in \u03c1 and negative\nmagnetoresistance have been observed also in the overdoped Bi-based cuprate in which Fe with a large magnetic\nmoment is partially substituted for Cu, [31] suggesting\nthe occurrence of the Kondo effect. Here, it should be\nstressed that the Kondo state generally appears in metallic samples. Therefore, the present result is one of significant evidences for the occurrence of a Fermi-liquid state\nin the overdoped regime.\n\nD.\n\nChange of the ground state upon hole doping\n\nIn the ground state of the underdoped regime, each\nNi2+ ion traps a hole strongly and a magnetically ordered state appears. In the ground state of the overdoped regime, on the other hand, a metallic state with\nKondo-like behavior due to Ni2+ spins is realized. It\nis found that TN decreases gradually with increasing peff\nand tends to disappear around peff = 0.18\u22120.19 as shown\nin Fig. 7. This is reminiscent of the possible existence\nof QCP around peff = 0.18 \u2212 0.19, as formerly suggested\nfrom various experiments. [15] As shown in Fig. 2, in\nfact, (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T exhibits a logarithmic increase with\ndecreasing temperature down to the lowest temperature\nof 0.4 K for (x, y) = (0.22 \u2212 0.23, 0.05), which is consistent with the theoretical prediction by Moriya and Ueda\nin the 2D-AF quantum critical region. [32]\nFor (x, y) = (0.15 \u2212 0.18, 0.05) and (0.20 \u2212 0.23, 0.10),\non the other hand, (Ctot \u2212Cph )/T increases with decreasing temperature due to the occurrence of the Kondo-like\n\n\f8\nstate, followed by a decrease at lower temperatures accompanied by a magnetic transition. Moreover, \u03b3LT is\napparently larger than \u03b3N for these samples. These are\ninconsistent with the concept of the simple QCP at which\ntwo adjacent phases in the ground state are definitely\nseparated in the phase diagram. Therefore, the present\nresults conflict with the simple QCP physics.\nIt has been suggested from the magnetization, [33\u2013\n38] specific heat [39\u201341] and \u03bcSR [42\u201344] measurements\nthat a microscopic phase separation into SC and normalstate regions takes place in a sample of the overdoped\nhigh-Tc cuprates. Based on these results, it is possible\nin Ni-substituted LSCNO that a phase-separated state\nconsisting of the magnetically ordered region observed\nin the underdoped regime and the metallic region observed in the overdoped regime is realized in a sample\naround the boundary between the magnetically ordered\nand metallic phases in the phase diagram. These explain\nthe specific-heat results around peff = 0.10 \u2212 0.13 exhibiting an enhancement of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T due to the\noccurrence of the Kondo-like state in the metallic region\nand a suppression of (Ctot \u2212 Cph )/T due to the strong\nhole-trapping by Ni2+ in the magnetically ordered region. Moreover, the above explanation is also supported\nby larger values of \u03b3LT shown in Fig. 3 than the expected\nones assuming the strong hole-trapping by Ni2+ . That\nis, as only the magnetically ordered region in a phaseseparated sample is characterized by peff , the value of\n\u03b3LT tends to be larger than that in the complete holetrapping state. Furthermore, the distinctive behavior of\n\u03c1 for (x, y) = (0.23, 0.10) shown in Fig. 5 is well explained taking into account the phase separation. That\nis, both the increase and following saturation of \u03c1 with a\ndecrease of temperature below \u223c 5 K are characteristic\nof a Kondo-like state in the metallic region of a sample,\nwhile the further increase of \u03c1 with decreasing temperature below 1 K is due to the strong hole-trapping by\nNi2+ in the magnetically ordered region of a sample.\nThe occurrence of the phase separation around the\nboundary between the magnetically ordered and metallic phases appears to be consistent with the results in\nLSCO where the superconductivity is suppressed by the\napplication of high magnetic field [19] or by the Zn substitution. [20] In-plane \u03c1 measurements in high magnetic\nfields in LSCO have revealed that a T -linear behavior\ncharacteristic of the quantum critical region is observed\nnot only in a limited region of p \u223c 0.19 but also in an\nextended one in the overdoped regime and coexists with\nthe T 2 behavior. The \u03bcSR measurements for 3 % Znsubstituted LSCZO have revealed that the Zn-induced\ndevelopment of the Cu-spin correlation does not vanish\naround p = 0.19 as formerly indicated by Panagopoulos et al. [21] but is weakened gradually with increasing p in the overdoped regime and disappears around\nx = 0.30. [20] These results are understood in terms of\na phase separation into a quantum critical region with\nthe T -linear resistivity and the developed Cu-spin correlation and a Fermi-liquid region with the T 2 resistiv-\n\nity. Accordingly, it is much convinced that the quantum phase transition in LSCO occurs not at a single\npoint of p in the ground state but in an extended region of p, that is, the change of the ground state upon\nhole doping is crossover-like due to the phase separation.\nSince the T -linear behavior of \u03c1 has been observed in\nvarious high-Tc cuprates [16\u201318] and the occurrence of\nthe phase separation has been proposed in various overdoped cuprates, [33\u201344] the present results together with\nformer ones [19, 20] strongly suggest that HTSC emerges\naround the quantum critical region affected by the phase\nseparation.\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have carried out specific heat, \u03c1, magnetization and\n\u03bcSR measurements in non-SC Ni-substituted LSCNO, in\norder to investigate the temperature-dependent change of\nthe electronic state and the ground state inside the pristine SC dome of LSCO without disturbing the Cu-spin\ncorrelation in the CuO2 plane so much. In the underdoped regime, it has been found that at high temperatures there exist two kinds of hole, that is, weakly localized holes around Ni2+ forming a Zhang-Rice doublet\nstate and itinerant holes forming a Zhang-Rice singlet\nstate, deduced from the metallic behavior of \u03c1 and the\nreduced value of S below 1 of Ni2+ spins. With decreasing temperature, itinerant holes tend to be localized and\nboth kinds of hole exhibit VRH conduction at low temperatures. Finally, in the ground state, each Ni2+ ion\ntraps a hole strongly and that a magnetically ordered\nstate appears, evidenced from the decrease in DOS at\nthe Fermi level in the specific heat measurements and\nfrom the appearance of a magnetic transition in the \u03bcSR\nmeasurements. In the overdoped regime, on the other\nhand, it has been found that a metallic state is realized\nat high temperatures, while a Kondo-like state is formed\naround Ni2+ spins at low temperatures, confirmed by the\nincrease in Cel /T , the logarithmic increase in \u03c1 and the\nnegative magnetoresistance. It has been concluded that\nthe ground state of non-SC LSCNO changes upon hole\ndoping from a magnetically ordered state with the strong\nhole-trapping by Ni2+ to a metallic state with Kondolike behavior due to Ni2+ spins and that the quantum\nphase transition is crossover-like due to the phase separation into short-range magnetically ordered and metallic regions. Since the T -linear behavior of \u03c1 has been\nobserved in various high-Tc cuprates [16\u201318] and the occurrence of the phase separation has been proposed in\nvarious overdoped cuprates, [33\u201344] it is suggested that\nHTSC emerges around the quantum critical region affected by the phase separation.\n\n\f9\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Y.
