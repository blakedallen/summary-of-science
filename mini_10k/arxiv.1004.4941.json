Introduction.\nA\nLet K be a p-adic number field with ring of integers A, and let G1/n\ndenote an \"AA\nheight n formal A-module\" over F p , that is, G1/n is a (one-dimensional) formal group law\nequipped with complex multiplication by A, and its underlying formal group law has p\u1e90 p\nis simply a p-height n\nheight dn, where d = [K : Q p ]. (In the base case K = Q p , G1/n\nformal group law over F p .) The automorphism group of the underlying formal group law\nA\nof G1/n\nis the well-known height dn Morava stabilizer group, whose cohomology is the\ninput for many spectral sequences computing stable homotopy groups of spheres and other\nspectra; see [4] and [5] for one approach, and chapter 6 of [18] for another. Among the\nA\nautomorphisms of the underlying formal group law G1/n\n, some automorphisms commute\nwith the complex multiplication by A, and others do not; hence the automorphism group of\nA\nG1/n\nis naturally a subgroup of the height dn Morava stabilizer group. (It is even a closed\nsubgroup; see Proposition 4.3 and also this paper's companion and sequel paper, [21].)\n\nDate: July 2016.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nANDREW SALCH\n\nIn this paper we develop methods for computing the restriction map from the cohomolA\nogy of the height dn Morava stabilizer group to the cohomology of Aut(G1/n\n). In particular,\nin Theorem 2.9 we compute the continuous linear dual Hopf algebra of the group ring of\nA\nAut(G1/n\n) (recall that, if A = \u1e90 p , this linear dual Hopf algebra is called the height n Morava\nstabilizer algebra; see section 6.3 of [18]), as well as the map from the height dn Morava\nA\nstabilizer algebra to the linear dual of the group ring of Aut(G1/n\n), induced by the inclusion\nA\nof Aut(G1/n ) into the Morava stabilizer group.\nThe rest of the paper consists of applications of Theorem 2.9. We make the cohomology\ncomputations for n = 1 and d = 2 and p > 3; that is, for each quadratic extension K/Q p , we\ncompute the restriction map in cohomology from the cohomology of the height 2 Morava\nstabilizer group to the cohomology of Aut(G1A ) \u001b A\u00d7 . Here A is again the ring of integers of\nK. Up to isomorphism, there are only quadratic extensions of Q p , one of which is unramified (and its relevant cohomological computation is Theorem 3.5), and two of which are\ntotally ramified (and their relevant cohomological computations are Theorems 3.6 and 3.7).\n\u001b\nBy local class field theory, the norm residue symbol map is an isomorphism A\u00d7 \u2212\u2192\nGal(K ab /K nr ), where K nr is the compositum of the unramified extensions of K, and K ab\nthe compositum of the abelian extensions of K; see Theorem 4.1 for a quick review of\nthis fact. The natural isomorphism Aut(G1A ) \u001b A\u00d7 , composed with the norm residue symbol, embeds A\u00d7 as a closed (by Proposition 4.3) subgroup of the height 2 Morava stabilizer group; hence, by the work of Goerss and Hopkins (see [7]), there exists an action\nof Gal(K ab /K nr ) on (a model for) the Lubin-Tate/Morava E-theory spectrum E2 , for each\nquadratic extension K/Q p , and by [5], there exists a descent spectral sequence whose input\nis the (continuous) Galois cohomology of K ab /K nr and whose output is the homotopy-fixed\nab\nnr\npoint spectrum E2h Gal(K /K ) . In Theorem 5.1 we run this spectral sequence after smashing\nwith the Smith-Toda complex V(1) at each prime p > 3, and we compute the resulting\nmap from the homotopy groups of LK(2) V(1) to the homotopy groups of the homotopy\nab\nnr\nfixed-point spectrum V(1) \u2227 E2h Gal(K /K ) .\nOne interesting consequence is that the map\n\u0013\n\u0012\nh Gal(Q p (\u03b6 p2 \u22121 )ab /Q p (\u03b6 p2 \u22121 )nr )\u22caGal(F p2 /F p )\n(1.0.1)\n\u03c0\u2217 (LK(2) V(1)) \u2192 \u03c0\u2217 V(1) \u2227 E2\nis injective on the sub-F p [v\u00b11\n2 ]-module of \u03c0\u2217 (LK(2) V(1)) generated by 1 and the element\n\u03b62 from Hopkins' chromatic splitting conjecture, and the map 1.0.1 is zero on the rest of\n\u03c0\u2217 (LK(2) V(1)). Here \u03b6 p2 \u22121 denotes a primitive (p2 \u2212 1)th root of unity.\nAnother interesting consequence is Corollary 4.6: the product of the restriction maps\nY\n\u1e90 p\n); F p2 ) \u2192\nHc\u2217 (Gal(K ab /K nr ); F p2 )\n(1.0.2)\nHc\u2217 (Aut(G1/2\n[K:Q p ]=2\n\nis injective in cohomological degrees \u2264 1, and for each homogeneous element\n\u1e90 p\n); F p2 ), either x or the Poincar\u00e9 dual of x has nonzero image under the\nx \u2208 Hc\u2217 (Aut(G1/2\nmap 1.0.2. (The product in the map 1.0.2 is taken over all isomorphism classes of quadratic\nextensions of Q p .) More generally: given a homogeneous element x \u2208 \u03c0\u2217 (LK(2) V(1)), eiab\nnr\nther x or the Poincar\u00e9 dual class of x is detected in \u03c0\u2217 (E2Gal(K /K ) ) for some quadratic\nextension K/Q. I do not know yet if this phenomenon generalizes to higher heights or to\nsmaller primes.\nThis paper is a complete (and much improved) rewrite of much older material I wrote\nwhen I was in graduate school. I am grateful to T. Lawson for suggesting a Galois descent\n\n\fMODULI OF FORMAL A-MODULES UNDER CHANGE OF A.\n\n3\n\nargument used in the proof of Theorem 5.1, and to D. Ravenel for teaching me a great deal\nabout formal modules and stable homotopy when I was a graduate student.\nConventions 1.1.\n\u2022 In this paper, all formal groups and formal modules are implicitly assumed to be one-dimensional.\n\u2022 Throughout, we will use Hazewinkel's generators for BP\u2217 (and, more generally,\nfor the classifying ring V A of A-typical formal A-modules, where A is a discrete\nvaluation ring).\n\u2022 By a \"p-adic number field\" we mean a finite field extension of the p-adic rationals\nQ p for some prime p.\n\u2022 When a ground field k is understood from context, we will write \u039b(x1 , . . . , xn ) for\nthe exterior/Grassmann k-algebra with generators x1 , . . . , xn , and P(x1 , . . . , xn ) for\nthe polynomial k-algebra with generators x1 , . . . , xn .\n\u2022 We make use of standard conventions when dealing with Hopf algebroids, as in\nAppendix 1 of [18]: we write \u03b7L , \u03b7R : A \u2192 \u0393 for the left and right unit maps of\na Hopf algebroid (A, \u0393), and if a \u2208 A, we sometimes also write a as shorthand for\n\u03b7L (a) \u2208 \u0393.\n\u2022 When G is an affine group scheme over a field k, we write k[G]\u2217 for the Hopf\nalgebra corepresenting G, and given a k[G]\u2217 -comodule M, we write H \u2217 (G; M) for\nthe group scheme cohomology Ext\u2217k[G]\u2217 \u2212comod (k, M).\n\u2022 When G is a profinite group and M a discrete G-module, we write Hc\u2217 (G; M) for\nthe usual continuous cohomology of G, i.e., Hc\u2217 (G; M) = colimN H \u2217 (G/N; M N ),\nwhere the colimit is taken over all finite index normal subgroups N of G.\n2. Moduli of formal A-modules under change of A.\nThe basic definition is:\nDefinition 2.1. Let A be a commutative ring, and let R be a commutative A-algebra. A\nformal A-module over R is a formal group law G(X, Y) \u2208 R[[X, Y]] together with a ring\nhomomorphism \u03c1 : A \u2192 End(G) such that \u03c1(a)(X) \u2261 aX modulo X 2 .\n\nThe addition in End(G) is the formal addition given by G, and the multiplication is\ncomposition. Chapter 21 of [9] is a good reference for formal A-modules; the paper [17]\nis a faster (but more abbreviated) introduction. Another reference which gives at least an\nattempt at an introductory account is [23].\nThe classical results on p-height and p-typicality (as in [10]) were generalized to formal A-modules, for A a discrete valuation ring (all but the first claim is proven by M.\nHazewinkel in chapter 21 of [9]; the first claim is easier, and not directly used in this paper,\nbut a proof can be found in [22]):\nTheorem 2.2. Let A be a discrete valuation ring of characteristic zero, with finite residue\nfield. Then the classifying Hopf algebroid (LA , LA B) of formal A-modules admits a retract\n(V A , V A T ) with the following properties:\n\u2022 The inclusion map (V A , V A T ) \u0592\u2192 (LA , LA B) and the retraction map (LA , LA B) \u0592\u2192\n(V A , V A T ) are maps of graded Hopf algebroids, and are mutually homotopy-inverse.\n\u2022 If F is a formal A-module over a commutative A-algebra R and the underlying\nformal group law of F admits a logarithm logF (X), then the classifying map LA \u2192\nP\nn\nR factors through the retraction map LA \u2192 V A if and only if logF (X) = n\u22651 \u03b1n X q\nfor some \u03b11 , \u03b12 , * * * \u2208 R \u2297Z Q, where q is the cardinality of the residue field of A.\n\u2022 V A \u001b A[v1A , v2A , . . . ] with vnA in grading degree 2(qn \u2212 1), and V A T \u001b V A [t1A , t2A , . . . ]\nwith tnA in grading degree 2(qn \u2212 1).\n\n\f4\n\nANDREW SALCH\n\n\u2022 The generators {viA } for V A , called the Hazewinkel generators, are defined as follows: we fix a uniformizer \u03c0 for A, and let v0A = \u03c0. The universal A-typical formal\nA-module has logarithm of the form\nX\ni\n(2.0.3)\nlog(x) =\n\u03bbiA x p ,\ni\u22650\n\nand the equation\n\u03c0\u03bbhA =\n\n(2.0.4)\n\nh\u22121\nX\n\ni\n\nA q\n\u03bbiA (vh\u2212i\n) ,\n\ni=0\n\ncan be solved recursively for elements v1A , v2A , * * * \u2208 V A ; these are the Hazewinkel\ngenerators.\n\u2022 We have a formula\nX\ni1 +***+ir\u22121\ni1\n(2.0.5)\n,\n\u03bbhA =\n\u03c0\u2212r viA1 (viA2 )q . . . (viAr )q\ni1 +***+ir =h\n\nwhere \u03c0 is the uniformizer and q the cardinality of the residue field of A, and all i j\nare positive integers.\nDefinition 2.3. Let A be a discrete valuation ring of characteristic zero, with uniformizer\n\u03c0, and with finite residue field. Let R be a commutative A-algebra, and let G be a formal\nA-module over R.\n\u2022 We say that G is A-typical if the classifying map LA \u2192 R factors through the\nretraction LA \u2192 V A .\n\u2022 If G is A-typical and n is a nonnegative integer, we say that G has A-height\n\u2265 n if the classifying map V A \u2192 R factors through the quotient map V A \u2192\nA\n). We say that G has A-height n if G has A-height \u2265 n but\nV A /(\u03c0, v1A , . . . , vn\u22121\nnot A-height \u2265 n + 1. If G has A-height \u2265 n for all n, then we say that G has\nA-height \u221e.\n\u2022 The inclusion V A \u2192 LA associates, to each formal A-module, an A-typical formal\nA-module typ(G) which is isomorphic to it. If G is an arbitrary (not necessarily\nA-typical) formal A-module, we say that G has A-height n if typ(G) has A-height\nn.\nThe following is proven in [9]:\nProposition 2.4. Let p be a prime number.\n\u2022 Every formal group law over a commutative \u1e90 p -algebra admits the unique structure of a formal \u1e90 p -module. Consequently, there is an equivalence of categories\nbetween formal group laws over commutative \u1e90 p -algebras, and formal \u1e90 p -modules.\nUnder this correspondence, a formal \u1e90 p -module is \u1e90 p -typical if and only if its underlying formal group law is p-typical. If G is a formal \u1e90 p -module of \u1e90 p -height n,\nthen its underlying formal group law has p-height n.\n\u2022 If L, K are finite extensions of Q p with rings of integers B, A respectively, if L/K is\na field extension of degree d, and if G is a formal B-module of B-height n, then the\nunderlying formal A-module of G has A-height dn.\n\u2022 In particular, if K/Q p is a field extension of degree d, if K has ring of integers A,\nand if G is a formal A-module of A-height n, then the underlying formal group law\nof G has p-height dn. Consequently, the only formal groups which admit complex\nmultiplication by A have underlying formal groups of p-height divisible by d.\n\n\fMODULI OF FORMAL A-MODULES UNDER CHANGE OF A.\n\n5\n\nDefinition 2.5. Let G be an A-typical formal A-module over a commutative A-algebra R\ngiven by power series G(X, Y) \u2208 R[[X, Y]] and \u03c1(X) \u2208 R[[X]]. The strict automorphism\ngroup scheme of G, written strictAut(G), is the group scheme which sends a commutative A-algebra S to the group of strict automorphisms of G \u2297R S , i.e., the group (under\ncomposition) of formal power series f (X) \u2208 S [[X]] such that\n\u2022 f (X) \u2261 X mod X 2 ,\n\u2022 f (G(X, Y)) = G( f (X), f (Y)), and\n\u2022 f (\u03c1(X)) = \u03c1( f (X)).\nBy the usual functor-of-points argument, the strict automorphism scheme strictAut(G)\nof G is co-represented by the Hopf algebra R \u2297V A V A T \u2297V A R, where R is an V A -algebra\nvia the ring map V A \u2192 R classifying G, and (as is the usual convention, see e.g. chapter 6\nof [18]) V A T is a left V A -algebra via the left unit map \u03b7L : V A \u2192 V A T and V A T is\na right V A -algebra via the right unit map \u03b7R : V A \u2192 V A T . (Recall that the left and\nright unit maps classifying the underlying A-typical formal A-module of the source and\ntarget of the universal strict isomorphism of A-typical formal A-modules.) We will write\nR[strictAut(G)]\u2217 for the co-representing Hopf algebra of strictAut(G).\nIt is worth being careful about notation: strictAut(G) is a profinite group scheme but\noften fails to be proconstant, so it is not always the case that R[strictAut(G)]\u2217 is the continuous R-linear dual of the group ring R[strictAut(G)(R)], even when R is a field.\nIn Definition 2.6 we introduce a new notation which we find very convenient:\nDefinition 2.6.

The claim about the behavior of the map 2.0.8 on the generators t1A , t2A , . . . is a\ngeneralization of Lemma 3.11(a) of [17]. Proving this claim requires some explanation\nof how the generators t1A , t2A , . . . in V A T work; see e.g. the proof of Theorem A.2.1.27(d)\nB\nin [18]. Write Guniv\nfor the universal B-typical formal B-module, and write logGuniv\nB (X) =\nP\nn\nB q\nB\nn\u22650 \u03bbn X for its logarithm.

Hence the map of\nHopf algebroids \u03b3 : (V Anr , V Anr T ) \u2192 (V B , V B T ) sends \u03b7R (\u03bbnAnr ) to \u03b7R (\u03bbnB ) for all n, i.e.,\nsolving the equation 2.0.10 yields that \u03b3(tnAnr ) = tnB .\nAnr\nThe unramified case is similar: the map V A \u2192 V Anr sends \u03bbnA to \u03bbne/d\nif n is divisible by\nthe residue degree d/e = [Knr : K], and sends \u03bbnA to zero if n is not divisible by the residue\ndegree, and solving equation 2.0.10 yields that the map\nA\nk(\u03b1)[strictAut(\u03b1 G1/dn\n)]\u2217\nei\n\n= k(\u03b1)[t1A , t2A , . . . ]/(tiA \u03b1q\n\n\u22121\n\nen\n\nei\n\n\u2212 (tiA )q \u2200i) \u2192 l[t1Anr , t2Anr , . . . ]/(tiAnr \u03b1q\n\n\u22121\n\nen\n\n\u2212 (tiAnr )q \u2200i)\n\nAnr\n= l[strictAut(\u03b1 Ge/dn\n)]\u2217\n\nAnr\nsends tnA to tne/d\nif n is divisible by the residue degree d/e = [Knr : K], and sends tnA to zero\nif n is not divisible by the residue degree.\n\n\fMODULI OF FORMAL A-MODULES UNDER CHANGE OF A.\n\n7\n\nNow for the claim about the kernel of the map 2.0.9: we need to break the problem into\ntwo parts, an unramified part and a totally ramified part. Let Knr denote the maximal unramified extension of K contained in L, and write Anr for the ring of integers of Knr . From\nLemma 3.11(b) of [17] we have that the map \u03b3 : V A \u2192 V Anr classifying the underlying\nAnr\nA-typical formal A-module of the universal Anr -typical formal Anr -module sends vnA to vne/d\nif the residue degree d/e divides n, and \u03b3(vnA ) = 0 if d/e does not divide n.\nMeanwhile, the map \u03b3\u2032 : V Anr \u2192 V B can be computed using equation 2.0.4:\n\uf8eb h\u22121\n\uf8f6\nh\u22121\n\uf8ec\uf8ecX\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u03c0A X\nAnr Anr qi \uf8f7\nB qi\n\u2032\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03bbiB (vh\u2212i\n)\n(2.0.11)\n\u03b3 \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ed \u03bbi (vh\u2212i ) \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 =\n\u03c0\nB i=0\ni=0\nB\nB\nB\nB\nand the fact that \u03b3\u2032 (\u03bbiAnr ) = \u03bbiB .

Then the profinite group scheme \u03b1 G1A is the proconstant group scheme taking the\n\n\f10\n\nANDREW SALCH\n\nvalue 1 + \u03c0A, the group (under multiplication) of 1-units in A. That is, the Hopf algebra\nk\u2032 [\u03b1 G1A ]\u2217 is the continuous k\u2032 -linear dual of the topological group ring k\u2032 [1 + \u03c0A].\nProof. It follows from the Barsotti-Tate module generalization of the well-known Dieudonn\u00e9Manin classification of p-divisible groups over algebraically closed fields (see [11]; also\n\u2032\nsee [16] for a nice treatment of the theory of Barsotti-Tate modules) that \u03b1 G1A \u2297k\u2032 k \u001b \u03b2 G1A \u2297k\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nk for all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 k\u2032 , where k is the algebraic closure of k\u2032 ; and that strictAut(\u03b1 G1A \u2297k\u2032 k ) is the\nproconstant group scheme with value 1 + \u03c0A.

In the case of strictAut(\u03b1 G1A ), it is profinite by virtue of being the limit (over\nn) of the strict automorphism group scheme of a formal A-module n-bud, and the strict\nautomorphism group scheme\n\u0010 i of a formal A-module\n\u0011 n-bud is corepresented by the Hopf\nalgebra k\u2032 [t1 , t2 , . . . , tm ]/ ti \u03b1q \u22121 \u2212 tiq , i = 1, . . . , m , where m is the integer floor of logq n.\ni\n\nThat Hopf algebra splits, as a k\u2032 -algebra, as the tensor product of copies of k\u2032 [ti ]/(ti \u03b1q \u22121 \u2212\ni\nq\nq\nti ) for various i.

So strictAut(\u03b1 G1A ) is indeed \"already\" (i.e., without any need to\nchange base to an algebraic closure) proconstant over k\u2032 .\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.3 is easy and classical, essentially a part of local class field theory:\nTheorem 3.3. Let p > 3, and let K/Q p be a quadratic extension with ring of integers A.\nLet \u03c0 be a uniformizer for A and let k be the residue field of A.

Here A is the ring of integers of K and k is the residue\nfield of A.\n1\n\"My own belief is that we know it already, though no one will believe me-that whatever can be said about\nnon-Abelian class field theory follows from what we know now, since it depends on the behavior of the broad\nfield over the intermediate fields-and there are sufficiently many Abelian cases,\" E.
