Let Fq be the field of q elements, where q is a power of a prime p. Let\nk := Fq (\u03b8), where \u03b8 is transcendental over Fq , and define an absolute value | * |\u221e at the\ninfinite place of k so that |\u03b8|\u221e = q. Let k\u221e := Fq ((1/\u03b8)) be the \u221e-adic completion of\nk, let k\u221e be an algebraic closure, let K be the \u221e-adic completion of k\u221e , and let k be\nthe algebraic closure of k in K.\n1.1.2. Anderson t-motives. Let t be a variable over Fq that is independent from \u03b8, and\nlet k[t; \u03c3] be the ring of polynomials in t and \u03c3 over k subject to the relations\nct = tc,\n\n\u03c3c = c1/q \u03c3,\n\n\u03c3t = t\u03c3,\n\nc \u2208 k.\n\nAn Anderson t-motive is a left k[t; \u03c3]-module M that is free and finitely generated as\nboth a left k[t]-module and as a left k[\u03c3]-module and that satisfies (t \u2212 \u03b8)n M \u2286 \u03c3M\nfor all n sufficiently large (see \u00a73.4). Anderson t-motives were originally defined in [2],\nwhere they were called \"dual t-motives.\"\nDate: June 29, 2007.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

We let T := K{t} be the Tate algebra of power series\nin K[[t]] that are convergent on the closed unit disk in K, and let L \u2286 K((t)) be its\nfraction field. Let E be the subring of T consisting of power series that are everywhere\nconvergent and whose coefficients lie in a finite extension of k\u221e . Finally, for a Laurent\nP n\nP\nseries f = i ai ti \u2208 K((t)) and an integer n \u2208 Z, we set \u03c3 \u2212n (f ) := f (n) := i aqi ti .\nIf M is an Anderson t-motive and m \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (M) has entries comprising a k[t]-basis\nof M, then there is a matrix \u03a6 \u2208 Matr (k[t]) representing multiplication by \u03c3 on M so\nthat\n\u03c3m = \u03a6m\n\u00d7\ns\nand det \u03a6 = c(t \u2212 \u03b8) for some c \u2208 k and s \u2265 1. The Anderson t-motive is rigid\nanalytically trivial (see Proposition 3.4.7) if there is a matrix \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (T) so that\n\u03a8(\u22121) = \u03a6\u03a8.\n\nIt can be shown that the entries of \u03a8 are in fact in E (see Proposition 5.1.3).\n1.1.4. Connection with t-modules. The category of rigid analytically trivial Anderson\nt-motives is equivalent to the category of uniformizable abelian t-modules defined over\nk, as in [1]. For a given Anderson t-motive M and associated t-module E, there is an\nexplicit connection\nperiods of E\n\n\u2190\u2192\n\nk-linear combinations of entries of \u03a8(\u03b8)\u22121 .\n\nThe details of this relationship will be the subject of a future paper with Anderson, but\nexamples are already seen in \u00a73.3 for the Carlitz motive (see also S. K. Sinha [28, \u00a75.2]\nfor examples involving special values of the function field \u0393-function).\n1.1.5. Remarks on t-motive terminology. G. Anderson introduced t-motives in [1]. Later\nin [2] dual t-motives, which had several technical advantages, were introduced. The algebraic properties of these two types of t-motives are essentially the same, and the\ntwo categories are anti-equivalent to each other. In this paper we will follow the dual\nt-motive point of view only, and throughout we refer to them as Anderson t-motives.\nIn the following paragraph we discuss a third type of t-motive, defined properly in \u00a73.4,\nwhich are our primary objects of study.\n1.1.6. Tannakian category of t-motives. In \u00a73.4 we show that the category of rigid\nanalytically trivial Anderson t-motives up to isogeny embeds as a full subcategory of a\nneutral Tannakian category T over Fq (t). Objects in T are called simply t-motives, and\nthroughout the paper the term \"t-motive\" will refer exclusively to an object in T. In\nparticular, from this standpoint all t-motives are rigid analytically trivial. Also objects\nin T do not necessarily come from pure Anderson t-motives in the sense of [1], and so\nT is a mixed category.\nBy Tannakian duality, for each object M in T, the Tannakian subcategory TM generated by M satisfies an equivalence of categories\nTM \u2248 Rep(\u0393M , Fq (t)),\n\nwhere Rep(\u0393M , Fq (t)) is the category of finite dimensional representations over Fq (t)\nof some algebraic subgroup \u0393M \u2286 GLr defined over Fq (t) (see \u00a73.5). The group \u0393M is\ncalled the Galois group of M .\nIt should be noted that R. Pink [23] has defined a category H of mixed Hodge structures for function fields that is a neutral Tannakian category over Fq (t). He showed that\nthe category of rigid analytically trivial Anderson t-motives that are also \"mixed\" embeds as a full subcategory of H. It would be interesting to investigate the relationships\namong Pink's Hodge structures, the t-motives defined in this paper, and their associated\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n3\n\nGalois groups. In the end our category of t-motives is best suited for our transcendence\napplications, so we do not pursue further here the connections with Pink's work. See\nalso D. Goss [14] for additional comparisons between t-motives and motives over Q.\nThe following is the main theorem of this paper (restated later as Theorem 5.2.2).\nTheorem 1.1.7. Let M be a t-motive, and let \u0393M be its Galois group. Suppose that\n\u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) \u2229 Matr (k[t]) represents multiplication by \u03c3 on M and that det \u03a6 =\n\u00d7\nc(t \u2212 \u03b8)s , c \u2208 k . Let \u03a8 be a rigid analytic trivialization of \u03a6 in GLr (T) \u2229 Matr (E).\nFinally, let L be the subfield of k\u221e generated over k by the entries of \u03a8(\u03b8). Then\ntr. degk L = dim \u0393M .\n1.1.8. Grothendieck's conjecture. In light of \u00a71.1.4, the statement of Theorem 1.1.7 can\nbe thought of as a function field version of Grothendieck's conjecture on periods of\nalgebraic varieties. For an abelian variety A over Q of dimension d, let P be the period\n1\nmatrix of A that represents an isomorphism between H 1 (A(C), Q)\u2297Q C and HDR\n(A/C),\nwith basis defined over Q. Grothendieck's conjecture is that\ntr. degQ Q(P ) = dim MT(A),\nwhere MT(A) is the Mumford-Tate group of A and is an algebraic subgroup of GL2d \u00d7Gm\nover Q. P. Deligne [11, Cor. I.6.4] has proved that the dimension of MT(A) is an upper\nbound for the transcendence degree. Conjecturally the Mumford-Tate group is isomorphic to the motivic Galois group of the motive h1 (A) \u2295 Q(1) over Q. More generally\nGrothendieck's period conjecture states that if X is a smooth variety over Q, then\ntr. degQ Q(P (X)) = dim \u0393mot\nX ,\nwhere P (X) is the period matrix of X and \u0393mot\nX is the motivic Galois group of X over Q.\nIt should be pointed out that by work of C. Bertolin [5] many standard transcendence\nconjectures over Q, such as Schanuel's conjecture, follow from expanded versions of\nGrothendieck's period conjecture.\n1.2. Algebraic independence of Carlitz logarithms. One application of Theorem 1.1.7 is a characterization of algebraic relations over k of Carlitz logarithms of\nalgebraic numbers.\n1.2.1. Carlitz exponential. The Carlitz exponential is the power series\ni\n\u221e\nX\nzq\nexpC (z) := z +\n.\ni\ni\n(\u03b8q \u2212 \u03b8)(\u03b8q \u2212 \u03b8q ) * * * (\u03b8qi \u2212 \u03b8qi\u22121 )\ni=1\n\nAs is well known (see [15, Ch. 3], [31, \u00a72.5]), the function defined by expC converges\neverywhere on K, is Fq -linear, and has kernel Fq [\u03b8] \u03c0\ne , where\n\u221e\n\u0011\n\u221a\n\u221a Y\u0010\ni \u22121\nq\u22121\nq\u22121\n\u2208 k\u221e (\n1 \u2212 \u03b81\u2212q\n\u2212\u03b8\n\u2212\u03b8)\u00d7 .\n\u03c0\ne := \u03b8\ni=1\n\nThe Carlitz exponential also satisfies the functional equation\nexpC (\u03b8z) = \u03b8 expC (z) + expC (z)q ,\n\nz \u2208 K.\n\nMoreover, this functional equation induces an exact sequence of Fq [t]-modules,\n0 \u2192 Fq [\u03b8] \u03c0\ne \u2192 K \u2192 C(K) \u2192 0,\n\nwhere C(K) is the Fq [t]-module of K-valued points on the Carlitz module C (see \u00a73.4.4)\nand where t acts by multiplication by \u03b8 on the first two terms. The number \u03c0\ne is called\nthe Carlitz period.\n\n\f4\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n1.2.2. Carlitz logarithm. The Carlitz logarithm is the inverse of expC (z),\ni\n\u221e\nX\nzq\nlogC (z) := z +\n,\n2\n(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8q )(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8q ) * * * (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8qi )\ni=1\nq/(q\u22121)\n\nwhich as a function on K converges for all z \u2208 K with |z|\u221e < |\u03b8|\u221e\nlogarithm is Fq -linear and satisfies the functional equation\n\n. The Carlitz\n\n\u03b8 logC (z) = logC (\u03b8z) + logC (z q ),\nfor all z \u2208 K where all three terms converge.\n1.2.3. Linear forms in Carlitz logarithms. We recall a theorem of J. Yu. Suppose\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr \u2208 K satisfy expC (\u03bbi ) \u2208 k for each i = 1, . . . , r. As in the previous section there are many potential k-linear relations among \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr . However, Yu proved\nthat these are the only possible linear relations over k in the following function field\nanalogue of Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms.\nTheorem 1.2.4 (Yu [33, Thm. 4.3]). Suppose \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr \u2208 K satisfy expC (\u03bbi ) \u2208 k for\ni = 1, . . . , r. If \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr are linearly independent over k, then the numbers 1, \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr\nare linearly independent over k.\nYu's result is an application of his far reaching Theorem of the Sub-t-module [33,\nThm. 0.1], which characterizes all k-linear relations among logarithms of points in k on\ngeneral t-modules. Transcendence results about the Carlitz periods and Carlitz logarithms go back to Carlitz and Wade in the 1940's. For detailed accounts of the history\nof transcendence results for Drinfeld modules, including Yu's theorem, see W. D. Brownawell [9] and D. S. Thakur [31, Ch. 10].\n1.2.5. Algebraic independence of Carlitz logarithms. In characteristic 0, Baker's theorem on linear forms in natural logarithms of algebraic numbers is best known. In the\nsituation of Carlitz logarithms we use Theorem 1.1.7 to prove the following theorem\n(restated later as Theorem 6.4.2).\nTheorem 1.2.6. Let \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr \u2208 K satisfy expC (\u03bbi ) \u2208 k for each i = 1, . . . , r.\nIf \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr are linearly independent over k, then they are algebraically independent\nover k.\nIt should be noted that, using Mahler's method, L. Denis [12] has proved the special\ncase of this theorem where \u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbr are restricted to values of logC on elements of\nFq (\u03b81/e ), e \u2265 1, of degree in \u03b8 less than q/(q \u2212 1).\n1.3. Methods of proof.\n1.3.1. \u03c3-semilinear difference equations. The category of t-motives is a certain full subcategory in the category of left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-modules which are finite dimensional as\nk(t)-vector spaces. To every t-motive M one can associate a matrix \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t))\nrepresenting multiplication by \u03c3 and a rigid analytic trivialization \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) so that\n\u03a8(\u22121) = \u03a6\u03a8. Here recall that L is the fraction field of the Tate algebra T. Thus the\ncolumns of \u03a8 satisfy a system of \u03c3-semilinear difference equations in the sense of [25],\n\u223c\nwhere \u03c3 = (f 7\u2192 f (\u22121) ) : L \u2192 L, and we develop the theory of such equations in this\ncontext in \u00a74. In spirit this theory is close to the Galois theory of differential equations\nand difference equations in characteristic 0 [4], [6], [10], [20], [24], [25], [26].\nIn \u00a74 we develop the Picard-Vessiot theory for certain kinds of difference equations for\n\u03c3 and construct their difference Galois groups (see Theorem 4.2.11). However, careful\nattention must be paid to the fact that the fixed field of \u03c3 in k(t) is Fq (t). The Galois\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n5\n\ntheory of difference equations developed by M. van der Put and M. F. Singer [25] is\nquite useful here, but it does not completely apply because they fundamentally use that\nthe field of fixed elements under the difference automorphism is algebraically closed.\nOn the one hand, because the fixed field of \u03c3 in L is also Fq (t), the Galois groups we\nconstruct are themselves defined over Fq (t). However, that Fq (t) is not algebraically\nclosed nor even perfect presents several difficulties because in general the Fq (t)-valued\npoints of the Galois group need not be dense and the group itself need not be a priori\nsmooth.\n1.3.2. t-motives and difference Galois groups. Given a t-motive M of dimension r over\nk(t), the difference Galois group \u0393 is a subgroup of GLr over Fq (t). Let \u03a3 be the k(t)subalgebra of L generated by the entries of \u03a8 and det(\u03a8)\u22121 , and let \u039b be its fraction\nfield. The field L is naturally a left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module via the automorphism \u03c3, and\n\u03a3 and \u039b are both \u03c3-invariant. Then\n\u0393(Fq (t)) \u223c\n= Aut\u03c3 (\u03a3/k(t)),\nwhere the right-hand side is the group of automorphisms of \u03a3 over k(t) that commute\nwith \u03c3. Moreover, this identification is compatible with base extensions of Fq (t) (see\n\u00a74.4.1\u20134.4.3).\nWe work out an explicit description of \u0393(Fq (t)) in \u00a74.4, and, using crucially that L\nis a separable extension of k(t) and that k(t) is algebraically closed in \u039b, we show that\n\u0393 has the following properties:\n\u2022 \u0393 is smooth over Fq (t) (Theorem 4.3.1(b));\n\u2022 dim \u0393 = tr. degk(t) \u039b, (Theorem 4.3.1(c));\n\n\u2022 The elements of \u039b fixed by \u0393(Fq (t)) are precisely k(t) (Theorem 4.4.6).\n\nThese properties are essential for proving in Theorem 4.5.10 that\n\u0393\u223c\n= \u0393M ,\n\nwhere \u0393M is the Galois group associated to M by Tannakian duality.\n1.3.3. The proof of Theorem 1.1.7. The primary vehicle for proving this theorem is a\nk-linear independence criterion from [2, Thm. 3.1.1]. It is stated here in Theorem 5.1.1.\nWe apply this criterion to the rigid analytic trivializations of tensor powers of M so as\nto compare the dimensions of the k-span of monomials of the entries of \u03a8(\u03b8) of a given\ndegree and the k(t)-span of monomials in the entries of \u03a8. Ultimately we show that\ntr. degk L = tr. degk(t) \u039b,\nthe latter of which is the same as the dimension of \u0393M .\n\u00d7\n\nq/(q\u22121)\n\n1.3.4. Carlitz logarithms.

We determine a set of defining equations of the Galois\ngroup \u0393X of X in Theorem 6.3.2 each of which is a linear polynomial over k(t). These\nlinear relations each produce a k-linear relation on the logarithms and \u03c0\ne. We then use\nTheorem 1.1.7 to show that all algebraic relations must arise from these relations.\n\n\f6\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n1.4. Acknowledgements. The author thanks D. Brownawell, L.

Let F be a field of characteristic p. For a formal series\nf := i\u2208Q ai ti with ai \u2208 F , we let Supp(f ) := {i \u2208 Q | ai 6= 0}. We let F hhtii be the set\nof such series for which Supp(f ) is a well-ordered subset of Q. This condition implies\nthat F hhtii is a field under the natural addition and multiplication of these series so\nthat ti tj = ti+j (see P. Ribenboim [27, \u00a72]). If F is algebraically closed, then F hhtii is\nalgebraically closed [27, \u00a75]. If F is a perfect field, then F hhtii is also perfect.\nIt should be noted that, when F is algebraically closed, F hhtii is not the algebraic\nclosure of the Laurent series field F ((t)).

For all definitions of tensor categories and Tannakian categories, we follow\nDeligne and J. S. Milne [11, \u00a7II]. Other useful references include [8], [10], [26, App. B].\nAs mentioned in \u00a71.1.6, Tannakian categories for t-motives have been considered\npreviously by Pink [23], though through a different construction. Parts of the theory\nof t-motives defined below have been considered by Y. Taguchi [29] and A. Tamagawa\n[30] in their study of the Tate conjecture for t-modules. Also our theory has similarities\nwith the theory of \u03c3-bundles defined by U. Hartl and Pink [16].\n3.1. The rings k[t; \u03c3] and k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ].\n3.1.1. Definition. The ring k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ] is the noncommutative ring of Laurent polynomials in the variable \u03c3 with coefficients in k(t), subject to the relation\n\u03c3f = \u03c3(f )\u03c3 = f (\u22121) \u03c3\nfor all f \u2208 k(t). Thus every element of k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ] has the form\nfi \u2208 k(t).\n\nPm\n\ni=\u2212m\n\nfi \u03c3 i , where\n\n3.1.2. Ring-theoretic properties. The polynomials in \u03c3 with coefficients in k[t] comprise\nthe subring k[t; \u03c3] of k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]. The ring k[\u03c3] is the subring of polynomials with\ncoefficients in k. Both k[t; \u03c3] and k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ] are domains. The center of k[t; \u03c3] is\nFq [t], and the center of k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ] is Fq (t). The fundamental properties of the ring\nk[t; \u03c3] are covered in [2, \u00a74].\n3.2. Pre-t-motives. Here we define the category P of pre-t-motives and explore its\nbasic properties. In particular we show in Theorem 3.2.13 that P is a rigid abelian\nFq (t)-linear tensor category.\n3.2.1. The category P. We let P be the category of left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-modules that are\nfinite dimensional over k(t). Morphisms in P are left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module homomorphisms. We call P the category of pre-t-motives, though it is worth noting that P is a\ncategory of difference modules with respect to the automorphism \u03c3 : k(t) \u2192 k(t) in the\nsense of [25].\n3.2.2. Preliminary properties of P. The category of pre-t-motives is an abelian category.\nFor two objects P and Q in P, it follows that HomP (P, Q) is an Fq (t)-vector space. A\nstraightforward adaptation of the proof of [1, Thm. 2] shows that the map\nHomP (P, Q) \u2297Fq (t) k(t) \u2192 Homk(t) (P, Q)\nis injective. Thus HomP (P, Q) is a finite dimensional Fq (t)-vector space.\n3.2.3. Representations of pre-t-motives.

If P is a pre-t-motive, then there is\na unique matrix \u03a6 = \u03a6p \u2208 GLr (k(t)) such that\n\u03c3p = \u03a6p.\n\n\f10\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\nWe say that \u03a6 represents multiplication by \u03c3 on P . Moreover, the matrix \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t))\nuniquely determines the left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module structure on P with respect to p.\nNow suppose that \u03c6 : P \u2192 Q is a morphism of pre-t-motives and that p \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (P )\nand q \u2208 Mats\u00d71 (Q) are bases for P and Q respectively.

Tensor products of pre-t-motives. Let P and Q be pre-t-motives. Then the k(t)vector space P \u2297k(t) Q is made into a k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module by defining\n\u03c3(m \u2297 n) := (\u03c3m) \u2297 (\u03c3n).\nIt is clear that then multiplication by \u03c3 is bijective on P \u2297k(t) Q and that P \u2297k(t) Q\nis a pre-t-motive. Likewise we define arbitrary finite tensor products of pre-t-motives\nNn\nwith diagonal \u03c3-action. For a fixed pre-t-motive P and n \u2265 1, we set P \u2297n := i=1 P\nto be the n-th tensor power of P .\n3.2.5. Representations of tensor products. Let p = [p1 , . . . , pr ]tr and q = [q1 , . . . , qs ]tr\nbe k(t)-bases for pre-t-motives P and Q respectively. Then, with respect to the basis\np \u2297 q := [p1 \u2297 q1 , p1 \u2297 q2 , . . . , pr \u2297 qs ]tr ,\non P \u2297 Q, the Kronecker product, \u03a6p\u2297q = \u03a6p \u2297 \u03a6q , represents multiplication by \u03c3\non P \u2297 Q. Similarly these conventions extend to arbitrary finite tensor products of\npre-t-motives.\n3.2.6. The Carlitz motive. We define the Carlitz motive to be the pre-t-motive C whose\nunderlying k(t)-vector space is k(t) itself and on which \u03c3 acts by\n\u03c3f := (t \u2212 \u03b8)f (\u22121) ,\n\nf \u2208 C.\n\nFor n \u2265 1, the underlying k(t)-vector space of C \u2297n is also k(t), and multiplication by\n\u03c3 on C \u2297n is given by\n\u03c3f = (t \u2212 \u03b8)n f (\u22121) , f \u2208 C \u2297n .\nSee also [3].\n\n3.2.7. Internal Hom. Let P and Q be pre-t-motives, and set\nR := Homk(t) (P, Q).\nThen R is a k(t)-vector space. We define a k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module structure on R by\nsetting\n\u03c3 * \u03c1 := \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u22121 , \u03c1 \u2208 R.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that \u03c3 * \u03c1 : P \u2192 Q is k(t)-linear, and so \u03c3 : R \u2192 R, and\nthat this action of \u03c3 extends naturally to a left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module structure on R. We\nwrite Hom(P, Q) for the k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module R just defined. It is also a pre-t-motive.\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n11\n\n3.2.8. Identity object. Let 1 := k(t) together with a \u03c3-action defined by\n\u03c3f = \u03c3(f ) = f (\u22121) ,\n\nf \u2208 1.\n\nThen 1 is a pre-t-motive. Moreover, for any pre-t-motive P , the natural isomorphisms,\nP \u22971 \u223c\n= 1\u2297P \u223c\n= P , are isomorphisms of pre-t-motives. Thus 1 is an identity object\nwith respect to tensor products in P.\nLemma 3.2.9. EndP (1) \u223c\n= Fq (t).\nProof. Suppose \u03c6 : 1 \u2192 1 is a morphism in P. As a map of k(t)-vector spaces, there is\nsome a \u2208 k(t) so that \u03c6(f ) = af for all f \u2208 k(t). Since \u03c6 is also k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3\u22121 ]-linear, we\n\u0003\nmust have \u03c3a = a\u03c3, and so a is in the center of k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]. Thus a \u2208 Fq (t).\n3.2.10. Duals. Let P be a pre-t-motive. Then set\nP \u2228 := Hom(P, 1).\nThe pre-t-motive P \u2228 is called the dual of P . As a k(t)-vector space, P \u2228 is the dual\nvector space of P . If p forms a basis for P , let p\u2228 be the dual basis. We find easily\nthat\n\u0001tr\n.\n\u03a6p\u2228 = \u03a6\u22121\np\n\nIf \u03c6 : P \u2192 Q is a morphism of pre-t-motives, then the dual morphism of k(t)-vector\nspaces, \u03c6\u2228 : Q\u2228 \u2192 P \u2228 , is also k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-linear. These constructions are functorial in\nP and Q, and thus P 7\u2192 P \u2228 : P \u2192 P defines a contravariant Fq (t)-linear functor.\n\n3.2.11. Dual of the Carlitz motive. Using the definition of the Carlitz motive in \u00a73.2.6,\nwe see that C \u2228 is isomorphic to k(t) as a k(t)-vector space and that\n1\n* f (\u22121) , f \u2208 C \u2228 (= k(t)).\n\u03c3f =\nt\u2212\u03b8\nFurthermore, we see that C \u2228 \u2297 C \u223c\n= 1 and that C is an invertible object in P. Thus\nthe functor\nP 7\u2192 P \u2297 C : P \u2192 P\nis an equivalence of categories. We define for n \u2208 Z,\n\uf8f1\n\u2297n\n\uf8f4\nif n > 0,\n\uf8f2C\nC(n) := 1\nif n = 0,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2228 \u2297\u2212n\n(C )\nif n < 0.\n\n3.2.12. Rigid abelian tensor category. In the language of [11, \u00a7II.1], it is easily shown\nthat the category of pre-t-motives is an abelian Fq (t)-linear tensor category. We omit\nthe details, but we observe that\n\u2022 each HomP (P, Q) is a finite dimensional vector space over Fq (t);\n\u2022 \u2297 is compatibly associative and commutative;\n\u2022 \u2297 is Fq (t)-bilinear;\n\u2022 1 is an identity object with respect to tensor products.\nFurthermore, it is straightforward to check that\n\u2022 the pre-t-motive Hom(P, Q) defines an internal Hom in P that is compatible\nwith tensor products;\n\u2022 for each pre-t-motive P , there is a natural isomorphism P \u223c\n= P \u2228\u2228 .\nTherefore, P is also rigid. We record this information in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.2.13. The category P of pre-t-motives is a rigid abelian Fq (t)-linear tensor\ncategory.\n\n\f12\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n3.3. Rigid analytic triviality.\n3.3.1. The category R. Let P be a pre-t-motive. We set\nP \u2020 := L \u2297k(t) P,\nand give P \u2020 a left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module structure by setting\nLet\n\n\u03c3(f \u2297 m) := f (\u22121) \u2297 \u03c3m.\n\nP B := (P \u2020 )\u03c3 = {\u03bc \u2208 P \u2020 | \u03c3\u03bc = \u03bc}.\nThen P B is an Fq (t)-vector space, and P 7\u2192 P B is a covariant functor from P to the category of Fq (t)-vector spaces. (The \"B\" in P B stands for \"Betti.\") It is straightforward\nto check that P 7\u2192 P B is left exact.\nWe say that P is rigid analytically trivial if the natural map\nL \u2297Fq (t) P B \u2192 P \u2020\n\nis an isomorphism. If P \u223c\n= Q as pre-t-motives and P is rigid analytically trivial, then\nso is Q. We let R denote the strictly full subcategory of P whose objects are the rigid\nanalytically trivial pre-t-motives. Clearly the zero object is rigid analytically trivial, and\nso R is non-empty. We shall see momentarily that 1 and C are also rigid analytically\ntrivial.\nLemma 3.3.2. We have L\u03c3 = Fq (t).\nProof. By definition, for f \u2208 L\u03c3 we have f (\u22121) = f , and so by (2.2.4.1) the polar divisor\nD of f on the closed unit disk in K must also satisfy D(\u22121) = D. Therefore D is the\ndivisor of zeros of a polynomial c in Fq [t]. Then cf \u2208 T, and (cf )(\u22121) = cf , from which\nwe have cf \u2208 T \u2229 Fq [[t]] = Fq [t].\n\u0003\nProposition 3.3.3. The pre-t-motive 1 is rigid analytically trivial.\nProof. It is clear that 1\u2020 = L with \u03c3f := f (\u22121) for f \u2208 L. Therefore, by Lemma 3.3.2,\n\u0003\n1B = L\u03c3 = Fq (t). Thus L \u2297Fq (t) 1B \u223c\n= 1\u2020 .\n3.3.4. The power series \u03a9.

Since \u03a9 has infinitely many zeros in K, it follows that \u03a9 \u2208\n/ K(t). Since \u03a9 has\nno zeros inside the unit disk, it follows that \u03a9 \u2208 T\u00d7 .

The proofs of parts (a) and (b) are essentially the same as the proof of [2,\nLem. 4.4.13] with minor modifications. We provide a sketch for completeness. ((a) \u21d0;\n(b)): Certainly if we have such a \u03a8, then the entries of \u03a8\u22121 p are both an L-basis of P \u2020\nand also an Fq (t)-linearly independent set in P B . By Proposition 3.3.8, the entries of\n\u03a8\u22121 p must be an Fq (t)-basis of P B , and thus P is rigid analytically trivial. ((a) \u21d2):\nOn the other hand, if P is rigid analytically trivial, then there is a matrix \u0398 \u2208 GLr (L)\nso that the entries of \u0398p are both an L-basis of P \u2020 and an Fq (t)-basis of P B . Setting\n\u03a8 := \u0398\u22121 gives the desired matrix.\nFor part (c), we first let P be the k[t]-span of the entries of p, and set\nP\u2020 := T \u2297k[t] P,\n\nPB := {\u03bc \u2208 P\u2020 | \u03c3\u03bc = \u03bc}.\n\n\f14\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\nP\nFor \u03bc \u2208 P B , write \u03bc =\nfi pi = f * p with f \u2208 Mat1\u00d7r (L). We claim that for some\nc \u2208 Fq [t], we have c\u03bc \u2208 PB . Let den(f ) \u2208 K[t] denote the monic least common multiple\nof the denominators of f , which is well-defined by (2.2.4.1). Then since \u03c3\u03bc = \u03bc, we\nhave\nf * p = \u03c3(f * p) = f (\u22121) * \u03a6p.\n\nTherefore, den(f ) = den(f (\u22121) * \u03a6). But \u03a6 \u2208 Matr (k[t]), so den(f (\u22121) * \u03a6) divides\nden(f (\u22121) ). Degree considerations force den(f ) = den(f (\u22121) ). Therefore take c =\nden(f ) \u2208 Fq [t]. This proves the claim, and moreover we have shown that\nPB \u223c\n= Fq (t) \u2297Fq [t] PB .\n\nFurthermore, it follows that as L-vector spaces, P \u2020 \u223c\n= L \u2297Fq [t] PB . Let \u03bd =\n= L \u2297 T P\u2020 \u223c\n[\u03bd1 , . . . , \u03bdr ]tr be an Fq [t]-basis for PB . Then for some \u0398 \u2208 GLr (L) \u2229 Matr (T), we have\n\u03bd = \u0398p. Since \u03c3\u03bd = \u03bd, it follows that \u0398(\u22121) \u03a6 = \u0398. By our initial hypotheses, d(t \u2212\n\u00d7\n\u03b8)s det(\u0398)(\u22121) = det(\u0398). Choose b \u2208 k so that d = b(\u22121) /b. Then from Lemmas 3.3.2\nand 3.3.5 (and the fact that \u0398 \u2208 Matr (T)), we see that\n\u03b3\nb det(\u0398) = s , \u03b3 \u2208 Fq [t].\n\u03a9\nWe claim that \u03b3 \u2208 F\u00d7\nq .

We also see\nthat\nP \u2192 P B : R \u2192 Vec(Fq (t)),\nwhere Vec(Fq (t)) is the category of finite dimensional vector spaces over Fq (t), is an\nexact Fq (t)-linear functor.\nProposition 3.3.13. Let P and Q be rigid analytically trivial pre-t-motives. Then the\nnatural map\nHomR (P, Q) \u2192 HomFq (t) (P B , QB )\nis injective.\nProof. Suppose \u03c6 : P \u2192 Q is a morphism in HomR (P, Q). Then we have an exact\nsequence in R,\n\u03c6\n\n0 \u2192 ker \u03c6 \u2192 P \u2192 Q \u2192 Q/\u03c6(P ) \u2192 0,\nwhich leads then to an exact sequence of Fq (t)-vector spaces,\n\u03c6B\n\n0 \u2192 (ker \u03c6)B \u2192 P B \u2192 QB \u2192 (Q/\u03c6(P ))B \u2192 0.\nSince the dimension over k(t) of each term in the first sequence is the same as the\ndimension over Fq (t) of the corresponding term in the second sequence, we see that\n\u03c6B = 0 if and only if \u03c6 = 0.\n\u0003\nProposition 3.3.14. If pre-t-motives P and Q are rigid analytically trivial, then\n(a) P \u2297Q is rigid analytically trivial, and the natural map P B \u2297Fq (t) QB \u2192 (P \u2297Q)B\nis an isomorphism of Fq (t)-vector spaces;\n\u0001\u2228\n\u0001B\n(b) P \u2228 is rigid analytically trivial, and the natural map P B\n\u2192 P\u2228\nis an\nisomorphism of Fq (t)-vector spaces.\nProof. Here we make use of Proposition 3.3.9. We first note that\n(P \u2297 Q)\u2020 = L \u2297k(t) (P \u2297k(t) Q) \u223c\n= (L \u2297k(t) P ) \u2297L (L \u2297k(t) Q) = P \u2020 \u2297L Q\u2020 ,\nwhere the middle isomorphism is an isomorphism of L-vector spaces that commutes\nwith the action of \u03c3. We observe that we can choose k(t)-bases for P , Q, and P \u2297 Q\nso that multiplication by \u03c3 is represented by matrices \u03a6P , \u03a6Q , and \u03a6P \u2297Q satisfying\n\u03a6P \u2297Q = \u03a6P \u2297 \u03a6Q .\n\nBy Proposition 3.3.9, we can choose \u03a8P , \u03a8Q \u2208 GLr (L) that are rigid analytic trivializations of \u03a6P and \u03a6Q . Then we note that \u03a8P \u2297Q := \u03a8P \u2297 \u03a8Q is a rigid analytic\ntr\ntrivialization of \u03a6P \u2297Q . Now note that \u03a6P \u2228 := (\u03a6\u22121\nP ) represents multiplication by \u03c3\n\u22121 tr\n\u2228\nwith respect to the dual basis and that \u03a8P := (\u03a8P ) is a rigid analytic trivialization.\nThe second parts of (a) and (b) are straightforward.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.3.15. The category R of rigid analytically trivial pre-t-motives is a neutral\nTannakian category over Fq (t) with fiber functor P 7\u2192 P B : R \u2192 Vec(Fq (t)).\nProof. We have seen that\n\u2022 1 is in R (Proposition 3.3.3);\n\u2022 R is an abelian category (Proposition 3.3.11 and \u00a73.3.12);\n\u2022 R is closed under tensor products and duals (Proposition 3.3.14).\nThus R is a rigid abelian Fq (t)-linear tensor subcategory of P (see [11, Defs. II.1.14-15]).\nWe have also shown that\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n17\n\n\u2022 EndR (1) = Fq (t) (Lemma 3.2.9);\n\u2022 For each P in R, the Fq (t)-vector space P B is finite dimensional (Proposition 3.3.8);\n\u2022 P 7\u2192 P B is Fq (t)-linear and exact (Proposition 3.3.11 and \u00a73.3.12);\n\u2022 P 7\u2192 P B is faithful (Proposition 3.3.13);\n\u2022 P 7\u2192 P B is a tensor functor (Proposition 3.3.14).\n\nThus R is a neutral Tannakian category over Fq (t) with fiber functor P 7\u2192 P B (see [11,\nDef. II.2.19]).\n\u0003\n\n3.4. Anderson t-motives. Here we recall the definitions and essential properties of\n\"dual t-motives\" from [2]. So as not to confuse these objects with the duals of t-motives\nto be used later on, we call these objects Anderson t-motives, since they are simply the\ndual notion of the objects studied in [1].\n3.4.1. Definition. An Anderson t-motive M is a left k[t; \u03c3]-module such that\n\u2022 M is free and finitely generated over k[t];\n\u2022 M is free and finitely generated over k[\u03c3];\n\u2022 (t \u2212 \u03b8)n M \u2286 \u03c3M for all n \u226b 0.\n\nA morphism of Anderson t-motives is a left k[t; \u03c3]-module homomorphism. In this way\nAnderson t-motives form a category.\nAs in \u00a73.2.3, if m \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (M) is a k[t]-module basis for M, then there is a matrix\n\u03a6 = \u03a6m \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (k[t]) so that\n\u03c3m = \u03a6m.\n\nSince a power of t \u2212 \u03b8 annihilates M/\u03c3M, we have\ndet \u03a6 = c(t \u2212 \u03b8)s\n\u00d7\n\nfor some c \u2208 k , where s is the rank of M as a k[\u03c3]-module.\n3.4.2. Anderson t-motives to pre-t-motives. Given an Anderson t-motive M we obtain\na pre-t-motive M by setting\nM := k(t) \u2297k[t] M\nand defining\n\u03c3(f \u2297 m) := f (\u22121) \u2297 \u03c3m.\n\nIt is straightforward to check that M is a left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-module, and it is of course\nfinite dimensional as a k(t)-vector space. Moreover, M 7\u2192 M is a functor from the\ncategory of Anderson t-motives to the category of pre-t-motives.\n3.4.3. The Carlitz motive. Let C be the Anderson t-motive whose underlying k[t]module is k[t] itself. Then the action of \u03c3 on C is defined by\n\u03c3(f ) = (t \u2212 \u03b8)f (\u22121) ,\n\nf \u2208 C.\n\nIt is not difficult to check that C is an Anderson t-motive, and that its image in P is\nthe Carlitz motive. For any n \u2265 1, we also have the n-th tensor power of C,\nC(n) := C \u2297k[t] * * * \u2297k[t] C,\nwith diagonal \u03c3-action. It is an Anderson t-motive sent to C(n) in P.\n\n\f18\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n3.4.4. The Carlitz module. The Carlitz module C over k is defined to be the Fq -algebra\nk together with an Fq [t]-module structure defined by\nCt (x) := \u03b8x + xq ,\n\nx \u2208 k.\n\nThat is the Fq -algebra homomorphism a 7\u2192 Ca : Fq [t] \u2192 k[\u03c3 \u22121 ] defined by t 7\u2192 \u03b8 + \u03c3\u22121\ninduces an Fq [t]-module structure on k. See [15, Ch. 3] or [31, \u00a72.5] for more details.\nTo see the relationship with the Carlitz motive, we note that there is an isomorphism\nC\nC(k) \u223c\n=\n(\u03c3 \u2212 1)C\nof Fq [t]-modules. Indeed if x \u2208 k, then\n\ntx = \u03b8x + (t \u2212 \u03b8)x = \u03b8x + \u03c3(xq ) = \u03b8x + xq + (\u03c3 \u2212 1)xq .\n\nSimilarly ax \u2261 Ca (x) (mod \u03c3 \u2212 1) for all a \u2208 Fq [t]. It is a simple matter to check that\nthere is a natural isomorphism of Fq -vector spaces C/(\u03c3 \u2212 1)C \u223c\n= k. Thus C/(\u03c3 \u2212 1)C\npresents the Carlitz module directly.\nProposition 3.4.5. For Anderson t-motives M and N, the natural map\nHomk[t;\u03c3] (M, N) \u2297Fq [t] Fq (t) \u2192 HomP (M, N )\nis an isomorphism of Fq (t)-vector spaces.\nProof. Let \u0398 denote the map in question. It is clearly Fq (t)-linear. To see that it is\ninjective, we first observe that if \u03b1 \u2208 Homk[t;\u03c3] (M, N) \u2297Fq [t] Fq (t) then \u03b1 = \u03c6 \u2297 v1 , for\nsome \u03c6 \u2208 Homk[t;\u03c3] (M, N) and v \u2208 Fq [t], v 6= 0. Then v\u0398(\u03b1) = \u0398(v\u03b1) = \u0398(\u03c6 \u2297 1) =: \u03c6.\nBut\n\u03c6 \u2208 Homk[t;\u03c3] (M, N) \u2286 Homk[t] (M, N),\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 Homk(t)[\u03c3,\u03c3\u22121 ] (M, N ) \u2286 Homk(t) (M, N ),\nand so \u03c6 = 0 if and only if \u03c6 = 0. Thus \u0398(\u03b1) = 0 if and only if \u03b1 = 0.\nFor surjectivity, suppose that \u03c6 \u2208 HomP (M, N ). Fix k[t]-bases m and n for M and N\nrespectively, and extend these to bases m and n of M and N . Then the map \u03c6 : M \u2192 N\nis represented by a matrix F \u2208 Matr\u00d7s (k(t)) so that F (\u22121) \u03a6n = \u03a6m F as in \u00a73.2.3. By\nchoice of m and n, \u03a6m and \u03a6n have entries in k[t], and it suffices to show that F has\nentries with denominators in Fq [t].\nFor a matrix B with entries in k(t), let den(B) \u2208 k[t] be the monic least common\nmultiple of the denominators of the entries of B. Since det(\u03a6n ) = c(t \u2212 \u03b8)s for some\n\u00d7\ns \u2265 0 and c \u2208 k , we see that\nden(F )(t \u2212 \u03b8)s * F (\u22121) = den(F )(t \u2212 \u03b8)s * \u03a6m F \u03a6\u22121\nn \u2208 Matr\u00d7s (k[t]).\n\nTherefore, den(F (\u22121) ) divides den(F )(t\u2212\u03b8)s . However, den(F (\u22121) ) = den(F )(\u22121) and so\ndeg(den(F (\u22121) )) = deg(den(F )). Thus, it suffices to show that den(F (\u22121) ) is relatively\nprime to t \u2212 \u03b8, since then den(F )(\u22121) = den(F ) whence all of the denominators of F\nare in Fq [t].\nSuppose that t \u2212 \u03b8 divides den(F (\u22121) ), and so t \u2212 \u03b8q divides den(F ). Then t \u2212 \u03b8q\ndivides den(\u03a6m F ), because otherwise t \u2212 \u03b8q would divide det(\u03a6m ) which is a power of\n(\u22121)\nt \u2212 \u03b8. Likewise, t \u2212 \u03b8q divides den(\u03a6m F \u03a6\u22121\n). By repeating the same\nn ) = den(F\n(\u22121)\nargument we see that den(F\n) is divisible by each of\n2\n\nt \u2212 \u03b8, t \u2212 \u03b8q , t \u2212 \u03b8q , . . .\n\ncontradicting that den(F (\u22121) ) \u2208 k[t].\n\n\u0003\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n19\n\n3.4.6. Rigid analytic triviality. Similar to \u00a73.3.1, if M is an Anderson t-motive, then we\nset\nM\u2020 := T \u2297k[t] M.\n\nWe provide M\u2020 with a k[t; \u03c3]-module structure by setting \u03c3(f \u2297 m) = f (\u22121) \u2297 \u03c3m, and\nwe set\nMB := (M\u2020 )\u03c3 = {\u03bc \u2208 M\u2020 | \u03c3\u03bc = \u03bc}.\nWe say that M is rigid analytically trivial if the natural map T \u2297Fq [t] MB \u2192 M\u2020 is an\nisomorphism. The following proposition is a companion to Proposition 3.3.9.\n\nProposition 3.4.7. Let M be an Anderson t-motive, and let M be its corresponding\npre-t-motive. Suppose m \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (M) is a k[t]-basis for M, and let \u03a6 \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (k[t])\nrepresent multiplication by \u03c3 on M with respect to m.\n(a) M is rigid analytically trivial if and only if it admits a rigid analytic trivialization\n\u03a8 with \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (T).\n(b) If \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (T) is a rigid analytic trivialization of \u03a6, then the entries of \u03a8\u22121 m\nform an Fq [t]-basis of MB .\n(c) M is rigid analytically trivial if and only if M is rigid analytically trivial.\nProof. The proofs of parts (a) and (b) are in [2, Lem. 4.4.13] and follow the same\nlines as their counterparts in Proposition 3.3.9. Part (c) is then a consequence of\nProposition 3.3.9(c).\n\u0003\n3.4.8. Definition. We define the category AI of Anderson t-motives up to isogeny as\nfollows:\n\u2022 Objects of AI : Anderson t-motives;\n\u2022 Morphisms of AI : For Anderson t-motives M and N,\nHomAI (M, N) := Homk[t;\u03c3] (M, N) \u2297Fq [t] Fq (t).\n\nWe also define the full subcategory ARI of rigid analytically trivial Anderson t-motives\nup to isogeny by restriction. We sum up the results of this section in the following\ntheorem.\nTheorem 3.4.9. Let P be the category of pre-t-motives, and let R be the category of\nrigid analytically trivial pre-t-motives.\n(a) The functor M 7\u2192 M : AI \u2192 P is fully faithful.\n(b) The functor M 7\u2192 M : ARI \u2192 R is fully faithful.\n\nProof. Part (a) is simply a restatement of Proposition 3.4.5. That the functor in part\n(b) is well-defined follows from Proposition 3.4.7(c), and its full faithfulness follows from\nProposition 3.4.5.\n\u0003\n3.4.10. The category T. We define the category T of t-motives to be the strictly full\nTannakian subcategory of R generated by the essential image of the functor\nM 7\u2192 M : ARI \u2192 R.\n\nThe category of t-motives can further be described as follows:\n\u2022 Objects of T: rigid analytically trivial pre-t-motives that can be constructed\nfrom Anderson t-motives using direct sums, subquotients, tensor products, duals, and internal Hom's.\n\u2022 Morphisms of T: morphisms of left k(t)[\u03c3, \u03c3 \u22121 ]-modules.\nIt is worth noting that Proposition 3.4.7(c) says that the category of t-motives is the\nstrictly full Tannakian subcategory of R generated by the intersection in P of R and\nthe image of all Anderson t-motives.\n\n\f20\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n3.5. Galois groups of t-motives. Having defined a Tannakian category of t-motives,\nit is now possible to assign to each t-motive a linear algebraic group over Fq (t), which\nwe call the Galois group of the t-motive. For essential facts about Tannakian categories\nand their associated groups, we refer to [8], [11], [26, App. B].\n3.5.1. Fiber functors. The functor\n\u03c9:T\nM\n\n\u2192 Vec(Fq (t))\n7\u2192 M B\n\nis the fiber functor of T. For any commutative Fq (t)-algebra R, we let \u03c9 (R) : T \u2192\nMod(R) be the extension of \u03c9 defined by\n\u03c9 (R) (M ) := R \u2297Fq (t) M B ,\n\nwhere Mod(R) is the category of finitely generated left R-modules. Now fix a t-motive\nM . We let TM be the strictly full Tannakian subcategory of T generated by M . That\nis, TM consists of all objects of T isomorphic to subquotients of finite direct sums of\nM \u2297u \u2297 (M \u2228 )\u2297v for various u, v. The fiber functor of TM is \u03c9M : TM \u2192 Vec(Fq (t)),\n(R)\nthe restriction of \u03c9 to TM , and similarly we restrict \u03c9M to TM for an Fq (t)-algebra R.\n3.5.2. Galois groups. As T is a neutral Tannakian category over Fq (t), there is an affine\ngroup scheme \u0393T over Fq (t) so that T is equivalent to the category Rep(\u0393T , Fq (t)) of\nfinite dimensional representations of \u0393T over Fq (t):\nT \u2248 Rep(\u0393T , Fq (t)).\n\nThe group \u0393T is defined to be the group of tensor automorphisms of the fiber functor\n\u03c9; that is, if R is any Fq (t)-algebra, then\n\u0001\n(R)\n\u0393T (R) = Aut\u2297\n.\nT \u03c9\n\nNow for any t-motive M , there is a linear algebraic group \u0393M := \u0393TM over Fq (t) so\nthat TM is equivalent to Rep(\u0393M , Fq (t)). As such, for any Fq (t)-algebra R, \u0393M (R) =\n(R) \u0001\nAut\u2297\nTM \u03c9M . In this way we find that we have a naturally defined faithful representation\n\u0393M \u0592\u2192 GL(M B )\nover Fq (t), which provides the basis for constructing the equivalence of categories,\nTM \u2248 Rep(\u0393M , Fq (t)).\n\nThe group \u0393M is called the Galois group of M . Furthermore, there is a surjective group\nhomomorphism,\n\u0393T \u0589 \u0393M .\nIf N is another t-motive in TM , then there is a natural surjective homomorphism,\n\u0393M \u0589 \u0393N . In \u00a74, we will show that \u0393M can be calculated using systems of \u03c3-semilinear\nequations. For now we will calculate the Galois group of the Carlitz motive C.\nLemma 3.5.3. For m, n \u2208 Z,\nHomT (C(m), C(n)) \u223c\n=\n\n(\n\nFq (t)\n0\n\nif m = n,\nif m =\n6 n.\n\nProof. By tensoring with C(\u2212m), we see that HomT (C(m), C(n)) \u223c\n= HomT (1, C(n \u2212\nm)). Thus it suffices to assume that m = 0. If \u03c6 : 1 \u2192 C(n) is a morphism in T,\nthen \u03c6 is represented by some a \u2208 k(t)\u00d7 such that a = a(\u22121) (t \u2212 \u03b8)n . By Lemma 3.3.5,\nthis equation has no non-zero solutions a \u2208 k(t) unless n = 0, in which case a can be\nanything in Fq (t).\n\u0003\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n21\n\nTheorem 3.5.4. For the Carlitz motive C, there is an isomorphism \u0393C \u223c\n= Gm over\nFq (t).\nProof. It is easy enough to check this theorem directly. However, by Lemma 3.5.3, TC\nis equivalent to a Z-graded category of vector spaces over k(t) with a fiber functor to\nVec(Fq (t)), and so its Galois group is Gm over Fq (t) [11, Ex. II.2.30].\n\u0003\n4. Galois theory of systems of \u03c3-semilinear equations\nIn this section we demonstrate how to calculate the Galois group of a t-motive as\nthe Galois group of a system of difference equations with respect to the automorphism\n\u03c3 : k(t) \u2192 k(t). These systems of equations and their Galois groups are similar to\nsystems of linear differential equations and their Galois groups, and one should compare\nour constructions with [25, Ch. 1], [26, Chs. 1\u20132], which we have used as guides, as well\nas [4], [6], [10], [18], [20], [24]. For an example of a Galois group of this type in the\ncontext of t-motives, see also the proof of [7, Prop. 7.1].\nVan der Put and Singer [25] have developed the theory of Picard-Vessiot rings for\nlinear difference equations which is quite useful in our context. However, their treatment generally assumes that the field of constants is algebraically closed. In our case\nthe field of constants is Fq (t), which presents several difficulties. On the other hand,\nthe Picard-Vessiot rings treated in [25] are not always domains, whereas our central\nPicard-Vessiot rings are domains by construction, which provides several benefits for\nthe characterization of their Galois groups. It is worth noting that some of what is\ncovered here is covered by the theory of Y. Andr\u00e9 [4], but we present everything from\nscratch for completeness. We thank the referee for making several useful suggestions\nfor improving the clarity of this section.\n4.1. Solutions of \u03c3-semilinear equations.\n4.1.1. Fields of definition. Let F \u2286 K \u2286 L be fields together with an automorphism\n\u03c3 : L \u2192 L. We say that the triple (F, K, L) is \u03c3-admissible if\n\u2022 \u03c3 restricts to automorphisms of F and K;\n\u2022 F = F \u03c3 = K \u03c3 = L\u03c3 ;\n\u2022 L is a separable extension of K.\nThe primary example of \u03c3-admissible fields that we have in mind is\n(F, K, L) = (Fq (t), k(t), L),\nwith automorphism \u03c3 defined as in \u00a72.2.5 by \u03c3(f ) = f (\u22121) . This example will be\nimportant for applications to t-motives in \u00a74.5. To see that this triple is \u03c3-admissible,\nwe know that Fq (t) = Fq (t)\u03c3 = k(t)\u03c3 by definition and that L\u03c3 = Fq (t) by Lemma 3.3.2.\nAlso, since L is linearly disjoint from k(t1/p ), it is therefore separable over k(t) [22, Thm.\n26.3]. Henceforth we shall assume that a \u03c3-admissible triple (F, K, L) has been chosen.\n4.1.2. Convention. If \u03c1 : S \u2192 R is a homomorphism of modules or rings, and B \u2208\nMatr\u00d7s (S), we let \u03c1(B) \u2208 Matr\u00d7s (R) be the matrix obtained by applying \u03c1 to the\nentries of B.\n4.1.3. Definition. Given a matrix \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (K), we consider vectors \u03c8 \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (L)\nthat satisfy\n\u03c3(\u03c8) = \u03a6\u03c8.\nIn this way, we define a system of \u03c3-semilinear equations, and \u03c8 is a solution. The set\nof solutions\nSol(\u03a6) := {\u03c8 \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (L) | \u03c3(\u03c8) = \u03a6\u03c8}\n\n\f22\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\nis an F -vector space.\nLemma 4.1.4. Let \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (K). Suppose that \u03c81 , . . . , \u03c8m \u2208 Sol(\u03a6) are linearly independent over F . Then they are linearly independent over L.\nProof. The proof is in the same spirit as the one for Lemma 3.3.7, and we omit it.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.1.5. Let \u03a6 \u2208 Matr (K). Then Sol(\u03a6) is an F -vector space of dimension\nat most r.\n4.1.6. Fundamental matrix of solutions. Given \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (K), suppose \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L)\nsatisfies\n\u03c3(\u03a8) = \u03a6\u03a8.\nThen by Lemma 4.1.4 and Corollary 4.1.5, the columns of \u03a8 form an F -basis for Sol(\u03a6).\nThe matrix \u03a8 is called a fundamental matrix for \u03a6. It is useful to note that \u03a8\u2032 \u2208 GLr (L)\nis another fundamental matrix for \u03a6 if and only if \u03a8\u22121 \u03a8\u2032 is fixed by \u03c3. That is, if and\nonly if \u03a8\u2032 = \u03a8\u03b4 for some \u03b4 \u2208 GLr (F ).\n4.2. The difference Galois group. Throughout this section we fix \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (K) and\nsuppose that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a fundamental matrix for \u03a6 with respect to our \u03c3-admissible\ntriple (F, K, L).\nFor a ring R, we let GLr/R denote the R-group scheme of r\u00d7r invertible matrices. Its\ncoordinate ring is R[X, 1/ det X], where X = (Xij ) is an r \u00d7 r matrix of independent\nvariables. If S is an R-algebra, we will as usual let GLr (S) denote the group of Srational points on GLr/R . For any R-scheme Z, we let ZS := S \u00d7R Z be its base\nextension to an S-scheme.\n4.2.1. Construction of \u0393. We define a K-algebra map \u03bd : K[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L by setting\n\u03bd(Xij ) := \u03a8ij . We let\np := ker \u03bd,\n\n\u03a3 := im \u03bd = K[\u03a8, 1/ det \u03a8] \u2286 L.\n\nWe let \u039b be the fraction field of \u03a3. Finally, we let Z = Spec \u03a3. In this way Z is the\nsmall closed subscheme of GLr/K such that \u03a8 \u2208 Z(L).\nNow set \u03a81 , \u03a82 \u2208 GLr (L \u2297K L) to be the matrices such that (\u03a81 )ij = \u03a8ij \u2297 1 and\ne := \u03a8\u22121 \u03a82 \u2208 GLr (L \u2297K L). We define an F -algebra map\n(\u03a82 )ij = 1 \u2297 \u03a8ij , and let \u03a8\n1\ne ij . We let\n\u03bc : F [X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297K L by \u03bc(Xij ) = \u03a8\nq := ker \u03bc,\n\n\u2206 := im \u03bc,\n\nand finally we set \u0393 = Spec \u2206. In this way \u0393 is the smallest closed subscheme of GLr/F\ne \u2208 \u0393(L \u2297K L). If we wish denote the dependence on \u03a8, we will write Z\u03a8\nsuch that \u03a8\nand \u0393\u03a8 for these spaces.\nAmong other things, we will see in Theorem 4.2.11 that \u0393 is a closed subgroup of\nGLr/F and that Z is a \u0393K -torsor under right-multiplication.\n4.2.2. The automorphisms \u03c3 0 and \u03c3 1 . We define a natural \u03c3-linear automorphisms\n\u03c3 0 , \u03c3 1 : L[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L[X, 1/ det X],\nby setting \u03c3 0 X := X and \u03c3 1 X := \u03a6X. We note that \u03c3 0 restricts to an automorphism\nof R[X, 1/ det X] for any F -subalgebra R of L, and that \u03c3 1 induces automorphisms of\nK[X, 1/ det X] and \u03a3[X, 1/ det X]. We see that\n\u03c3 0 q = q,\n\n\u03c3 1 p = p.\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n23\n\nThe first equality is clear since q \u2286 F [X, 1/ det X]. For the second, we note that for\nh(X) \u2208 K[X, 1/ det X], we have \u03c3 1 (h)(X) = \u03c3 0 (h)(\u03a6X), and so\n\u03c3 1 (h)(\u03a8) = \u03c3 0 (h)(\u03a6\u03a8) = \u03c3 0 (h)(\u03c3(\u03a8)) = \u03c3(h(\u03a8)).\n\nThus, \u03c3 1 p = p. This equality implies further that \u03bd\u03c3 1 = \u03c3\u03bd. The following lemma provides a correspondence between the contraction and extension of ideals in L[X, 1/ det X].\nSee also [26, Lem. 1.23].\nLemma 4.2.3. The functions between sets of ideals,\n{a \u2286 F [X, 1/ det X]} \u2190\u2192 {b \u2286 L[X, 1/ det X] | \u03c3 0 b = b},\na\n\u2192\n(a)\nb \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X]\n\u2190\nb\n\nare bijections.\n\nProof. Since \u03c3 0 is trivial on F [X, 1/ det X] \u2286 L[X, 1/ det X], these maps are welldefined. One knows already that (a)\u2229F [X, 1/ det X] = a for all ideals a \u2286 F [X, 1/ det X]\n(see [34, \u00a7VII.11]). Now let b \u2286 L[X, 1/ det X] be an ideal with \u03c3 0 b = b, and let\na := b \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X]. Letting {gi }i\u2208I be an F -basis of F [X, 1/\nPdet X], we have that\n{gi }i\u2208I is an L-basis of L[X, 1/ det X]. For h \u2208 b we write h =\nbi gi , bi \u2208 L, and we\nlet l(h) be the number of i \u2208 I for which bi 6= 0. We show that h \u2208 (a) by induction\non l(h). If l(h) = 0 the result is clear. If l(h) = 1, then h = bg for some b \u2208 L\u00d7 and\ng \u2208 {gi }. Moreover, then g \u2208 a. Now suppose that l(h) > 1. By multiplying by an\nelement of L we can assume that bi1 = 1 and that bi2 \u2208 L \\ F for some i1 , i2 \u2208 I. (If all\nbi \u2208 F , then h \u2208 a.) One sees that\nl(\u03c3 0 h \u2212 h) < l(h),\n\nand since \u03c3 0 b = b, we have \u03c3 0 h \u2212 h \u2208 b. Therefore, \u03c3 0 (h) \u2212 h \u2208 (a). Similarly,\n\u22121\n\u03c3 0 (b\u22121\ni2 h) \u2212 bi2 h \u2208 (a). However,\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\n(\u03c3(b\u22121\ni2 ) \u2212 bi2 )h = \u03c3 0 (bi2 h) \u2212 bi2 h \u2212 \u03c3(bi2 ) * (\u03c3 0 h \u2212 h).\nThe left-hand side is non-zero, and the right-hand side is in (a). Therefore h \u2208 (a). \u0003\n\nProposition 4.2.4. Define a morphism of affine L-schemes \u03c6 := ZL \u2192 GLr/L so\nthat on points u 7\u2192 \u03a8\u22121 u for u \u2208 Z(L). Then \u03c6 factors through an isomorphism\n\u03c6\u2032 : ZL \u2192 \u0393L of affine L-schemes.\nProof. For commutative rings R \u2286 S and for any ideal I in R[X, 1/ det X], we let IS\ndenote its extension to S[X, 1/ det X]. Now the ideal p \u2286 K[X, 1/ det X] is the defining\nideal of the K-scheme Z, and q \u2286 F [X, 1/ det X] is the defining ideal of of the F -scheme\n\u0393. If we set\n\u03b1 : L[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L[X, 1/ det X],\nto be the L-algebra homomorphism determined by setting \u03b1(X) = \u03a8\u22121 X, then the\nmap\n\u000e\n\u03b1 : L[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L[X, 1/ det X] pL ,\ninduced by \u03b1, is the map \u03c6 on the level of coordinate rings. It then suffices to prove\nthat qL = \u03b1\u22121 pL .\nAs noted in \u00a74.2.2, we have that \u03c3 0 qL = qL and \u03c3 1 pL = pL . Furthermore,\n\u03c3 1 \u03b1X = \u03c3 1 (\u03a8\u22121 X) = (\u03c3\u03a8)\u22121 (\u03c3 1 X) = \u03a8\u22121 X = \u03b1\u03c3 0 X,\n\nand so \u03c3 1 \u03b1 = \u03b1\u03c3 0 , which implies that\n\u03c3 0 \u03b1\u22121 pL = \u03b1\u22121 pL .\n\n\f24\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\nBy Lemma 4.2.3, it follows that \u03b1\u22121 pL is generated by \u03b1\u22121 pL \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X].\nNow we regard L \u2297K L as an L-algebra through the map f 7\u2192 f \u2297 1. If we let \u03bc\u0303 :\nL[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297K L be the unique L-algebra homomorphism such that \u03bc\u0303X = \u03a82 ,\nthen we note that the composition\n\u03b1\n\n\u03bc\u0303\n\nF [X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297K L\nis in fact \u03bc. Since L is a field, the map L[X, 1/ det X]/pL \u2192 L \u2297K L induced by \u03bc\u0303 is\ninjective. Therefore,\nq = \u03b1\u22121 pL \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X],\n\nand by our argument in the previous paragraph, qL = \u03b1\u22121 pL .\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 4.2.5. The ideal p \u2286 K[X, 1/ det X] is maximal among proper \u03c3 1 -invariant\nideals.\nProof. Let m \u2287 p be a proper ideal of K[X, 1/ det X] such that \u03c3 1 m \u2286 m. Because\nK[X, 1/ det X] is noetherian, it follows that \u03c3 1 m = m. Now \u03b1\u22121 mL \u2287 \u03b1\u22121 pL = qL ,\nand we see easily that \u03c3 0 \u03b1\u22121 mL = \u03b1\u22121 mL . Therefore, by Lemma 4.2.3,\n\u03b1\u22121 mL = (\u03b1\u22121 mL \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X])L .\nLet a \u2286 F [X, 1/ det X] be a maximal ideal that contains \u03b1\u22121 mL \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X],\nand let E := F [X, 1/ det X]/a, which is a finite extension of F . By Lemma 4.2.3,\nwe see that a = aL \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X], and it follows that there is an isomorphism \u03b2 :\n\u223c\nL[X, 1/ det X]/aL \u2192 L \u2297F E. Now if we consider the maps\n\u03b1\u22121\n\n\u03b2\n\n\u03a0 : L[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297F E,\nwe see that mL \u2286 ker \u03a0. If we let \u03c0 : K[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297F E be the restriction of \u03a0,\nthen easily m \u2286 ker \u03c0 and ker \u03c0 is a proper ideal. Moreover, since \u03b1\u22121 \u03c3 1 = \u03c3 0 \u03b1\u22121 , it\nfollows that ker \u03c0 is a \u03c3 1 -invariant ideal of K[X, 1/ det X]. Therefore, the maximality\nof m implies that m = ker \u03c0.\nNow let \u03a8\u2032 \u2208 GLr (L \u2297F E) be defined by \u03a8\u2032ij = \u03c0(Xij ). The automorphism \u03c3 on L\nextends to an automorphism of L \u2297F E by acting by the identity on E, and it is easily\nseen that (L \u2297F E)\u03c3 = E. In this way \u03c3(\u03a8\u2032 ) = \u03a6\u03a8\u2032 , and this implies that the matrix\n\u03b4 := (\u03a8\u2032 )\u22121 \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (E). Now \u03b4 induces an automorphism on (K \u2297F E)[X, 1/ det X]\nvia\n\u2032\n\n\u03b4 * h(X) := h(X\u03b4).\n\nIf we extend \u03c0 to \u03c0 : (K \u2297F E)[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297F E by the identity on E, then we\nsee that we have the extended ideals\npK\u2297F E = p \u2297F E \u2286 m \u2297F E \u2286 ker \u03c0 \u2032 = \u03b4 * (p \u2297F E).\nBut (K \u2297F E)[X, 1/ det X] is a noetherian ring, and so p \u2297F E \u2286 \u03b4 * (p \u2297F E) implies\nthat p \u2297F E = \u03b4 * (p \u2297F E). Thus,\np \u2297F E = m \u2297F E = \u03b4 * (p \u2297F E).\nNow (K \u2297F E)[X, 1/ det X] is a free K[X, 1/ det X]-module, since E is a vector space\nover F , and is therefore faithfully flat over K[X, 1/ det X]. So by intersecting with\nK[X, 1/ det X] we see that p = m (see [22, Thm. 7.5]).\n\u0003\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n25\n\n4.2.6. Contracted ideals of \u03a3[X, 1/ det X]. The following lemma is a companion to\nLemma 4.2.3, and relies on the preceding corollary. See also [25, Lem. 1.11].\nLemma 4.2.7. Let b \u2282 \u03a3[X, 1/ det X] be an ideal that is \u03c3 0 -invariant. Then b is\ngenerated by b \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X].\nProof. Let a := b \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X]. Let {gi }i\u2208I be an F -basis for F [X, 1/ det X] such\nthat I = IaP\n\u222a I1 , where {gi }i\u2208Ia is an F -basis for a. Choose a subset J \u2286 I1 minimal\nso that b \u2229 i\u2208J \u03a3gi contains a non-zero element of b/(a). Pick j \u2208 J, and let\nP\nm := {b \u2208 \u03a3 | \u2203 i\u2208J bi gi \u2208 b/(a), bj = b}\n\nSince \u03c3 0 b = b, and since each gi is fixed by \u03c3 0 , it follows that m is a non-zero \u03c3invariant ideal of \u03a3. However, by Corollary 4.2.5, \u03a3 has no \u03c3-invariant ideals\nP other\nthan {0} and \u03a3. Thus, m = \u03a3. Therefore there exists h \u2208 b so that h = i\u2208J bi gi\nmod (a) and bj = 1. Now \u03c3 0 (h) \u2212 h is supported on a proper subset of J modulo (a),\nand so\nP it must be 0 modulo (a) by the minimality of J. Therefore each bi \u2208 F , and\n\u0003\nthus i\u2208J bi gi \u2208 (a), which is a contradiction.\nProposition 4.2.8. Define a morphism of affine K-schemes \u03c8 : Z \u00d7 Z \u2192 Z \u00d7 GLr/K\nso that on points (u, v) 7\u2192 (u, u\u22121 v) for u, v \u2208 Z(K). Then \u03c8 factors through an\nisomorphism Z \u00d7 Z \u2192 Z \u00d7 \u0393K of affine K-schemes.\n\nProof. Again we work on the level of coordinate rings and maintain conventions and\ndefinitions in the proof of Proposition 4.2.4. The ring \u03a3 \u2286 L is isomorphic to the\ncoordinate ring of Z over K. Likewise, the ring \u03a3[X, 1/ det X]/p\u03a3 is the coordinate\nring of Z \u00d7 Z, and \u03a3[X, 1/ det X]/q\u03a3 is the coordinate ring of Z \u00d7 \u0393K . The L-algebra\nautomorphism \u03b1 in the proof of the previous proposition restricts to an automorphism\nof \u03a3[X, 1/ det X], and in this way the homomorphism\n\u000e\n\u03b1 : \u03a3[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 \u03a3[X, 1/ det X] p\u03a3\ninduced by \u03b1 represents the morphism \u03c8 of affine K-schemes. We then need to show\nthat q\u03a3 = \u03b1\u22121 p\u03a3 .\nLet a = \u03b1\u22121 p\u03a3 \u2229 F [X, 1/ det X]. By Lemma 4.2.7,\n\u03b1\u22121 p\u03a3 = a\u03a3 .\n\nThen as in the proof of Proposition 4.2.4, qL = \u03b1\u22121 pL and both are now equal to aL .\nSince q and a are both ideals in F [X, 1/ det X] and F and L are fields, it follows that\nq = a.\n\u0003\nLemma 4.2.9. Let G be a group, and let A and B be subsets of G, A non-empty, such\nthat the map\n(u, v) 7\u2192 (u, u\u22121 v) : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A \u00d7 G\nfactors through a bijection \u03c6 : A \u00d7 A \u2192 A \u00d7 B. Then B is a subgroup of G and A is\nstable under right-multiplication by elements of B.

PAPANIKOLAS\n\nTheorem 4.2.11. Let (F, K, L) be a \u03c3-admissible triple for an automorphism \u03c3 : L \u2192\nL. Suppose we have \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (K) and \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) so that \u03c3(\u03a8) = \u03a6\u03a8. Then \u0393 := \u0393\u03a8\nis a closed F -subgroup scheme of GLr/F , and the closed K-subscheme Z := Z\u03a8 of\nGLr/K is stable under right-multiplication by \u0393K and is a \u0393K -torsor.\nProof. Since Z(\u03a3) is non-empty, Propositions 4.2.4 and 4.2.8 imply that (u, v) 7\u2192\n(u, u\u22121 v) : Z(\u03a3) \u00d7 Z(\u03a3) \u2192 Z(\u03a3) \u00d7 \u0393(\u03a3) is a bijection. Lemma 4.2.9 and the Yoneda\nlemma [32, \u00a71.2\u20131.4] imply that \u0393\u03a3 is a subgroup of GLr/\u03a3 and that Z\u03a3 is a \u0393\u03a3 -torsor.\nSince the inclusion F \u2192 \u03a3 is faithfully flat, we see that \u0393 is a closed F -subgroup\nscheme of GLr/F by flat descent [32, \u00a717.1\u201317.3]. Similarly, since the inclusion K \u2192 \u03a3\nis faithfully flat, Z admits the structure of a \u0393K -torsor.\n\u0003\n4.3. Criterion for smoothness. We continue with the notation of the previous section, and in particular have fixed a \u03c3-admissible triple (F, K, L) together with \u03a6 \u2208\nGLr (K), \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) satisfying \u03c3(\u03a8) = \u03a6\u03a8. In this section, we explore when \u0393 is\nsmooth over F , that is, when the coordinate ring of \u0393F is reduced.\nTheorem 4.3.1. Suppose K is algebraically closed in the fraction field \u039b of \u03a3. Then\n(a) The K-scheme Z is absolutely irreducible and is smooth over K.\n(b) The F -scheme \u0393 is absolutely irreducible and is smooth over F .\n(c) The dimension of \u0393 over F is equal to the transcendence degree of \u039b over K.\nProof. The ideal p \u2286 K[X, 1/ det X] is prime. The field \u039b is separable over K, since\nit is a subfield of L. That K is algebraically closed in \u039b then implies that pK \u2286\nK[X, 1/ det X] is prime [34, VII.11, Thm. 39]. Thus Z is smooth over K. Because\n\u0393K \u223c\n= ZK , \u0393 must be smooth over F . By construction the transcendence degree of \u039b\nover K is equal to the dimension of Z, which is equal to the dimension of \u0393.\n\u0003\n4.3.2. The case (Fq (t), k(t), L). This case is of particular interest to our applications to\nt-motives. It turns out that in this case, all Galois groups are smooth, via the following\nproposition. We continue with our usual notation.\nProposition 4.3.3. Suppose (F, K, L) = (Fq (t), k(t), L), and suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t))\nand \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) satisfy \u03a8(\u22121) = \u03a6\u03a8. Then k(t) is algebraically closed in \u039b = k(t)(\u03a8).\n\u0001\nProof. Let f \u2208 \u039b \u2229 k(t), and consider the field H := k t; f (i) : i \u2208 Z obtained by\nadjoining all of the twists of f to k(t). Each f (i) is algebraic over k(t), and so H/k(t) is\nalgebraic. Since \u039b is finitely generated as a field over k(t), so is H. Thus [H : k(t)] < \u221e.\nFurthermore, H is invariant under \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u22121 .\nThe field H is the function field of a smooth projective curve X over k, and the\ninclusion k(t) \u2286 H provides a surjective morphism X \u2192 P1k over k. Now \u03c3 : H \u2192 H\ninduces an automorphism \u03c4 : X \u2192 X as a scheme over Fq . Because \u03c3 leaves the\nintegral closure of k[t] in H invariant, the points \u221e1 , . . . , \u221ed in X above the point \u221e\nin Pk1 are permuted by \u03c3. Thus we can construct an effective divisor I of X such that\n\u03c4 (I) = I and Supp(I) = {\u221e1 , . . . , \u221ed }. Now for N \u2265 1 sufficiently large, the field H\nis generated over k(t) by the functions in the finite dimensional k-vector space\nS := \u0393(X, N * I) \u2286 H.\n\nBy our assumptions on I, this space is invariant under \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u22121 . If the entries of\nf := [f1 , . . . , fm ]tr form a k-basis for S, then there is a matrix A \u2208 GLm (k) so that\n\u03c3(f ) = Af . If g \u2208 Matm\u00d71 (S) and g = Bf for some B \u2208 GLm (k), then\n\u03c3(g) = B (\u22121) AB \u22121 g.\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n27\n\nBy the theory of Lang isogenies [19], we can pick a B \u2208 GLm (k) so that\nB \u22121 B (1) = A(1) ,\n\nand if we let g := Bf , then \u03c3(g) = g. Thus S contains a k-basis g that is fixed by\n\u03c3, and H = k(t, g). Let g be an entry of g. Then g \u2208 k(t) \u2229 L\u03c3 = Fq (t). Thus\n\u0003\n[H : k(t)] = 1.\nCorollary 4.3.4. Let (F, K, L) = (Fq (t), k(t), L), and suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) and\n\u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) satisfy \u03c3(\u03a8) = \u03a6\u03a8. Then the Galois group \u0393 of \u03a8 is smooth over Fq (t).\n4.4. The Galois action. In this section we will assume that K is algebraically closed\nin \u039b, and so in particular by Theorem 4.3.1, \u0393F and ZK are reduced and irreducible.\n4.4.1. \u03c3-automorphisms of \u03a3 and \u039b. Let Aut\u03c3 (\u03a3/K) denote the group of automorphisms of \u03a3 over K that commute with \u03c3. Similarly we define Aut\u03c3 (\u039b/K). In fact, it\nis true that\nAut\u03c3 (\u03a3/K) = Aut\u03c3 (\u039b/K).\nIndeed every automorphism \u03be \u2208 Aut\u03c3 (\u03a3/K) extends uniquely to an automorphism in\nAut\u03c3 (\u039b/K). On the other hand, if \u03b7 \u2208 Aut\u03c3 (\u039b/K), then as matrices in Matr (L),\n\u03c3(\u03b7(\u03a8)) = \u03b7(\u03c3(\u03a8)) = \u03b7(\u03a6\u03a8) = \u03a6\u03b7(\u03a8). Thus, \u03b7(\u03a8) = \u03a8\u03b3 for some \u03b3 \u2208 GLr (F ), and so\n\u03b7(\u03a8) \u2208 Matr (\u03a3). Therefore \u03b7 restricted to \u03a3 takes values in \u03a3.\n4.4.2. The action of \u0393(F ). For \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(F ), we have an automorphism of K-schemes\n\u03b3 : Z \u2192 Z defined by right multiplication by \u03b3. On the level of coordinate rings, the\ninduced map is\n\u03b3 = (h(X) 7\u2192 h(X\u03b3)) : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3,\nwhich is a K-linear automorphism that commutes with the action of \u03c3. Thus we have\na group homomorphism,\n\u03ba : \u0393(F ) \u2192 Aut\u03c3 (\u039b/K),\nwhich is easily seen to be injective. Now if \u03b4 \u2208 Aut\u03c3 (\u039b/K), then \u03b4 induces an automorphism of the non-empty Z(\u039b) that is right-multiplication by an element of \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(\u039b).\nThat \u03b4 commutes with \u03c3 implies that \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(\u039b\u03c3 ) = \u0393(F ). Thus \u03ba is an isomorphism.\n4.4.3. Base extensions. Given our \u03c3-admissible triple (F, K, L), we choose an extension\n\u03c3\nof \u03c3 to an automorphism of L. Then L is an algebraic extension of F . Indeed, the\n\u03c3\nmonic irreducible polynomial of any h \u2208 L over L must have coefficients in L\u03c3 = F .\n\u03c3\nThus if we let F = L , then (F, K, L) is a \u03c3-admissible triple. The Galois group \u0393\u2032\ndefined by the system \u03c3(\u03a8) = \u03a6\u03a8 defined with respect to (F, K, L) is seen to be \u0393F by\ne be the coordinate of Z and \u039b\ne be its fraction\nPropositions 4.2.4 and 4.2.8. If we let \u03a3\nK\nfield, then we see that\ne\ne\n\u0393(F) \u223c\n= Aut\u03c3 (\u039b/K).\n= Aut\u03c3 (\u03a3/K)\n\u03c3n\n\nFurthermore, for n \u2265 1, let Fn = L , and suppose that (Fn , K, L) is \u03c3 n -admissible.\nThen \u03a8 is a fundamental matrix for \u03a6n := \u03c3 n\u22121 (\u03a6) * * * \u03c3(\u03a6)\u03a6. Again by Propositions 4.2.4 and 4.2.8, we see that the Galois group of this system of equations is \u0393Fn .\nAnd thus,\ne\ne\n\u0393(Fn ) \u223c\n= Aut\u03c3n (\u039b/K).\n= Aut\u03c3n (\u03a3/K)\n\n4.4.4. Galois action for \u0393(F ). Continuing with the notation of the previous paragraphs,\ne\nsuppose that F = \u222aFn . Then every element of \u0393(F ) induces an automorphism of \u039b/K\nn\nthat commutes with \u03c3 for all n \u226b 0. In this case, we will call this the induced action\ne\nof \u0393(F ) on \u039b.\n\n\f28\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n4.4.5. The case (Fq (t), k(t), L). It is worth pointing out that the situation is quite nice\nin our usual setting. For n \u2265 1, the triple (Fqn (t), k(t), L) is \u03c3 n -admissible. As in \u00a72.2.5,\nthere is a canonical extension of \u03c3 to Khhtii \u2287 L. Furthermore, we see that\nL\n\n\u03c3n\n\n\u03c3n\n\n= k(t)\n\n\u03c3n\n\n= Fq (t)\n\n=: Fn ,\n\nand so (Fn , k(t), L) is a \u03c3 n -admissible triple. Every element of Fq (t) is fixed by some\npower of \u03c3, and so\n[\nFq (t) =\nFn .\nn\u22651\n\nWe now return to the general situation, but it is important to note that the following\ntheorem applies to Galois groups in the usual (Fq (t), k(t), L) setting.\n\nTheorem 4.4.6. Let \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (K), and suppose that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a fundamental\nmatrix for \u03a6. Assume that K is algebraically closed in \u039b = K(\u03a8). Fix an extension of\n\u03c3n\n\u03c3 to L, and let Fn := L . Suppose that (Fn , K, L) is \u03c3 n -admissible for each n \u2265 1,\ne be the coordinate ring of Z and let \u039b\ne be its fraction\nand suppose that F = \u222aFn . Let \u03a3\nK\nfield, both considered subrings of L.\ne fixed by \u0393(F ) is K.\n(a) The subfield of \u039b\n(b) The elements of \u039b fixed by \u0393(F ) are precisely K.\ne is fixed by \u0393(F ). We consider f \u2208 \u039b\ne to be\nProof. See [25, Lem. 1.28]. Suppose f \u2208 \u039b\n1\na function f : ZK \u2192 PK . For i = 1, 2, we consider the two maps of K-schemes\n\u03c0\n\nf\n\n1\n,\ngi : ZK \u00d7 \u0393K \u2192 ZK \u00d7 ZK \u2192i ZK \u2192 PK\n\nwhere \u03c0i is the i-th projection. Because f is \u0393(F )-invariant and because \u0393(F ) is dense\nin \u0393K since \u0393 is smooth over F , we must have g1 = g2 . Therefore, f \u25e6 \u03c01 = f \u25e6 \u03c02 ,\nwhich implies that f is constant. This proves part (a). Part (b) follows from part (a)\nand the assumption that K is algebraically closed in \u039b.\n\u0003\n4.4.7. Remark. If \u0393(F ) is Zariski dense in \u0393, then it follows that \u039b\u0393(F ) = k(t).\n4.5. The group \u0393 and t-motives. Given a t-motive M , we defined the Galois group\n\u0393M of M in \u00a73.5.2. Associated to M we can also choose a matrix \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) that\nrepresents multiplication by \u03c3 on M . Let \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) be a rigid analytic trivialization\nof \u03a6. We will show that \u0393M is isomorphic to \u0393 := \u0393\u03a8 over Fq (t).\n4.5.1. t-motives and \u03c3-semilinear equations. Let M be a t-motive. We fix the following\nnotation throughout this section. Let m be a basis for M , and let \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t))\nrepresent multiplication by \u03c3 on M . We pick a rigid analytic trivialization \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L)\nfor M , which is at the same time a fundamental matrix for \u03a6.\nLet Mvu := M \u2297u \u2297 (M \u2228 )\u2297v . Because TM is Tannakian, if N is any t-motive in TM ,\nthen N is the subquotient of a direct sum of various Mvu , and vice versa. It follows\nfrom Propositions 3.3.9(b) and 3.3.11(b) that the entries of a fundamental matrix \u03a8N\nfor N are in \u03a3, and in fact we can take \u03a8N \u2208 GLs (\u03a3) for some s.\nFor an Fq (t)-algebra R, we let \u03a3(R) := R \u2297Fq (t) \u03a3.\nLemma 4.5.2. For any t-motive N in TM and Fq (t)-algebra R, the natural map,\n\u03a3(R) \u2297Fq (t) N B \u2192 \u03a3(R) \u2297k(t) N\nis bijective.\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n29\n\nProof. Let \u03ba be the map defined in the statement of the lemma. Thus as above we can\npick a basis n for N and a rigid analytic trivialization \u03a8N \u2208 GLs (\u03a3) with respect to n.\n\u22121\nB\n(R)\nBy Proposition 3.3.9(b), \u03a8\u22121\n-basis\nN n is an Fq (t)-basis for N . Now 1 \u2297 (\u03a8N n) is a \u03a3\n(R)\nB\nof \u03a3\n\u2297Fq (t) N (here and elsewhere 1 \u2297 A for a matrix A is the matrix of the same\ndimension whose entries are each tensored by 1 on the left). If f \u2208 Mat1\u00d7s (\u03a3(R) ), then\n\u0001\n\u22121\n\u03ba (f \u2297 1) * (1 \u2297 (\u03a8\u22121\nN n)) = (f \u03a8N \u2297 1) * (1 \u2297 n).\n\nThe entries of (\u03a8\u22121\nN \u2297 1) * (1 \u2297 n) are in the image of \u03ba, and\n\u03a8N * (\u03a8\u22121\nN \u2297 1) * (1 \u2297 n) = 1 \u2297 n.\n\nThus \u03ba is surjective. Since \u03a8N \u2208 GLs (\u03a3), the map \u03ba is bijective.\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.5.3. Let M be a t-motive, and let N be a t-motive in TM . If we consider\nN B to be an algebraic group over Fq (t), then there is a natural representation\n\u03beN : \u0393 \u2192 GL(N B )\nover Fq (t) that is functorial in N .\nProof. Since every t-motive N in TM is constructed from M via tensor products, duals,\nand subquotients, to define this representation it suffices to define it on M B itself.\nFunctoriality in N will be automatic.\nTo define the representation on M B , it suffices by the Yoneda lemma [32, \u00a71.2\u20131.4]\nto define a representation\n(R)\n\n\u03beM : \u0393(R) \u2192 GL(R \u2297Fq (t) M B )\nfor every Fq (t)-algebra R and show that it is functorial in R. Let R be an Fq (t)-algebra,\nand let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(R). Define\n\u039e(R) (\u03b3) := \u03b3 \u2297 1 = (h(\u03a8) \u2297 m 7\u2192 h(\u03a8\u03b3) \u2297 m) : \u03a3(R) \u2297k(t) M \u2192 \u03a3(R) \u2297k(t) M,\n\nwhich is an isomorphism of k(t)-vector spaces. Now by Lemma 4.5.2, R\u2297Fq (t) M B spans\n\u03a3(R) \u2297k(t) M as a \u03a3(R) -module. Let \u03be (R) (\u03b3) be the restriction of \u039e(R) (\u03b3) to R\u2297Fq (t) M B .\nWe claim that the image of \u03be (R) (\u03b3) is R \u2297Fq (t) M B . Indeed, since \u03a8\u22121 m forms an\nFq (t)-basis of M B by Proposition 3.3.9(b), for f \u2208 Mat1\u00d7r (R), we have\n\u03be (R) (\u03b3) : f * (1 \u2297 \u03a8\u22121 )m 7\u2192 f * \u03b3 \u22121 (1 \u2297 \u03a8\u22121 )m.\n\nThus \u03be (R) (\u03b3) is an R-linear automorphism of R\u2297Fq (t) M B . It is straightforward to check\nthat this is construction is functorial in R, and so we have defined a homomorphism\n\u03beM : \u0393 \u2192 GL(M B ).\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.5.4. Let M be a t-motive. The representation \u03beM : \u0393 \u2192 GL(M B ) is\nfaithful.\nProof. As defined in the the proof of the previous theorem we see easily that \u03be (R) :\n\u0393(R) \u2192 GL(R \u2297Fq (t) M B ) is injective for all Fq (t)-algebras R.\n\u0003\n4.5.5. The functor \u03beM . For a t-motive M , if \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) represents multiplication\nby \u03c3 on M and if \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a rigid analytic trivialization of \u03a6, then Theorem 4.5.3\ndefines a functor\n\u03beM : TM \u2192 Rep(\u0393, Fq (t)).\nIt is straightforward to check that \u03beM is a tensor functor. Let\n\u223c\n\n\u03b7M : Rep(\u0393M , Fq (t)) \u2192 TM\n\n\f30\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\nbe the equivalence of categories defined in \u00a73.5.2. Letting\nF : Rep(\u0393, Fq (t)) \u2192 Vec(Fq (t))\nbe the forgetful functor, we see immediately that \u03c9M = F \u25e6\u03beM . Thus by [11, Cor. II.2.9],\nthere is a unique homomorphism \u03c0M : \u0393 \u2192 \u0393M over Fq (t) so that the natural functor\n\u03c4M : Rep(\u0393M , Fq (t)) \u2192 Rep(\u0393, Fq (t)) induced by \u03c0M satisfies\n\u03beM \u25e6 \u03b7M = \u03c4M .\nProposition 4.5.6. Let M be a t-motive. Suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) represents\nmultiplication by \u03c3 on M and that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a rigid analytic trivialization for \u03a6.\nThen the functor\n\u03beM : TM \u2192 Rep(\u0393, Fq (t))\n\nis fully faithful.\n\nProof. For any t-motives N and P in TM , there is a natural isomorphism of Fq (t)vector spaces, HomTM (P, N ) \u223c\n= HomTM (1, Hom(P, N )). Thus it suffices to prove full\nfaithfulness when P = 1. Now HomTM (1, N ) \u223c\n= N \u2229 N B = {n \u2208 N | \u03c3n = n}, and this\nprovides an injection HomTM (1, N ) \u0592\u2192 Hom\u0393 (1B , N B ).\nConversely suppose that \u03c6 : 1B \u2192 N B is a \u0393-morphism. Pick a k(t)-basis n for\nN . Then \u03c6(1) = h(\u03a8) * n for some h(\u03a8) \u2208 Mat1\u00d7s (\u03a3) by Lemma 4.5.2. Let E/Fq (t)\nbe a finite extension of fields. We see that for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E), the action of \u03be (E) (\u03b3) :=\n(E)\n\u03beM (N )(\u03b3) on E \u2297Fq (t) N B is simply the restriction of the natural map \u039e(E) (\u03b3) =\n1 \u2297 \u03b3 : \u03a3(E) \u2297k(t) N \u2192 \u03a3(E) \u2297k(t) N to E \u2297Fq (t) N B . Since \u03c6 is a \u0393-morphism, it follows\nthat \u03be (E) (\u03b3)(\u03c6(1)) = \u03c6(1) for all \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E). Thus,\nh(\u03a8) * n = \u03c6(1) = \u03be (E) (\u03b3)(\u03c6(1)) = h(\u03a8\u03b3) * n,\n\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E).\n\nBecause n is a \u03a3(E) -basis of \u03a3(E) \u2297k(t) N , the entries of h(\u03a8) must each be fixed\nby every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E). By varying over all E/Fq (t) finite, Theorem 4.4.6 implies that\nh(\u03a8) \u2208 Mat1\u00d7s (k(t)). Thus \u03c6(1) \u2208 N \u2229 N B .\n\u0003\nLemma 4.5.7. Let \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)), and suppose that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a fundamental\nmatrix for \u03a6. Suppose that W \u2286 \u039b\u2295s is a vector subspace over \u039b such that for every\nfinite extension of fields E/Fq (t),\n\u0393(E) * (E \u2297Fq (t) W ) \u2286 E \u2297Fq (t) W.\nThen W has a system of defining equations over k(t).\nProof. Suppose that W has dimension s\u2212m, and let A(\u03a8) \u2208 Matm\u00d7s (\u039b) be a coefficient\nmatrix for a system of defining equations for W . By changing the order of the variables\nif necessary, we can use Gaussian elimination on A(\u03a8) to obtain\nG(\u03a8) = [Im , C(\u03a8)],\nwhere C(\u03a8) \u2208 Matm\u00d7(s\u2212m) (\u039b). Both A(\u03a8) and G(\u03a8) provide coefficient matrices for\nequations for W , and so it suffices to show that C(\u03a8) has entries in k(t).\nLet E/Fq (t) be a finite extension of fields. Since E \u2297Fq (t) W is invariant under\n\u0393(E), it follows that, for every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E), the matrix G(\u03a8\u03b3 \u22121 ) is also the coefficient\nmatrix of a defining set of equations for E \u2297Fq (t) W . Now the columns of the matrix\n[\u2212C(\u03a8), Is\u2212m ]tr \u2208 Matm\u00d7s (\u039b) form a basis for W .

Suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) represents\nmultiplication by \u03c3 on M and that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a rigid analytic trivialization for\n\u03a6. For every t-motive N in TM and every \u0393-subrepresentation V of N B , there is a\nsub-t-motive P \u2286 N so that \u03beM (P ) = V .\nProof. Pick a k(t)-basis n \u2208 Mats\u00d71 for N with \u03c3n = \u03a6N n, and let \u03a8N \u2208 GLs (L) be a\nrigid analytic trivialization for \u03a6N . Let v \u2208 Matv\u00d71 (N B ) be an Fq (t)-basis for V , and\nextend v to a basis u of N B , u = [v, w]tr . By Lemma 4.5.2, there is a H(\u03a8) \u2208 GLs (\u03a3)\nso that u = H(\u03a8) * n. We note that H(\u03a8) = \u03b4 \u22121 \u03a8\u22121\nN for some \u03b4 \u2208 GLs (Fq (t)) by\nProposition 3.3.9(b).\nLet E/Fq (t) be a finite extension of fields, and let \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E). The action of \u03b3 on\nE \u2297Fq (t) N B is given by the restriction of \u039e(E) as in the proof of Proposition 4.5.6 to\nE \u2297Fq (t) N B . Thus,\n\u03be (E) (\u03b3)(u) = H(\u03a8\u03b3)n = H(\u03a8\u03b3)H(\u03a8)\u22121 u.\nSince V is invariant under \u0393, it follows that the upper right v \u00d7 (s \u2212 v) block of\nH(\u03a8\u03b3)H(\u03a8)\u22121 is 0 for every \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393(E). Let D(\u03a8) \u2208 Mats\u00d7(s\u2212v) (\u039b) be the s \u2212 v\nright-most columns of H(\u03a8)\u22121 , and consider the subspace W \u2286 Mat1\u00d7s (\u039b),\nW = {x \u2208 Mat1\u00d7s (\u039b) | x * D(\u03a8) = 0}.\nBy our considerations on H(\u03a8) at the end of the preceding paragraph, we see from\nLemma 4.5.7 that W has a set of defining equations over k(t). Thus there is a C \u2208\nMatv\u00d7s (k(t)) of maximal rank so that C * D(\u03a8) = 0. Extend C to a matrix B \u2208\nGLs (k(t)) such that C forms the top rows of B. Now let n\u2032 = B * n = [p, q]tr , with\n\u03c3n\u2032 = \u03a6\u2032 n\u2032 , and let P be the k(t)-span of p = C * n.

Thus P is a sub-t-motive of\nN . Furthermore, as H(\u03a8)\u22121 = \u03a8N \u03b4, \u03b4 \u2208 GLs (Fq (t)), it follows that B * H(\u03a8)\u22121 is a\nrigid analytic trivialization of \u03a6\u2032 . If we set take \u03a8P to be the upper left-hand block of\nB * H(\u03a8)\u22121 , then \u03a8P is a rigid analytic trivialization for \u03a6P . Moreover, it follows that\nP B = V by Proposition 3.3.9(b).\n\u0003\nProposition 4.5.9. Let M be a t-motive. Suppose that \u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) represents\nmultiplication by \u03c3 on M and that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (L) is a rigid analytic trivialization for \u03a6.\nTo every representation W in Rep(\u0393, Fq (t)) there is a t-motive N in TM so that W is\nisomorphic to a subquotient of \u03beM (N ).\nProof. The representation M B is faithful by Corollary 4.5.4. Thus any object in\nRep(\u0393, Fq (t)) is isomorphic to a subquotient of a direct sum of representations of\nthe form (M B )uv := (M B )\u2297u \u2297 ((M B )\u2228 )\u2297v .

Then\nthe functor\n\u03beM : TM \u2192 Rep(\u0393, Fq (t))\nis an equivalence of Tannakian categories. Equivalently, the homomorphism \u03c0M : \u0393 \u2192\n\u0393M is an isomorphism over Fq (t).\nProof. By Propositions 4.5.6 and 4.5.8, the map \u03c0M is faithfully flat [11, Prop. II.2.21(a)].\nBy Proposition 4.5.9, \u03c0M is a closed immersion [11, Prop. II.2.21(b)]. Thus \u03c0M is an\nisomorphism of affine group schemes over Fq (t).\n\u0003\n4.5.11. Remark. Although we have focused on objects in the category T, the above\ntheorem is true (with the same proof) if M is replaced by simply a rigid analytically\ntrivial pre-t-motive.\n5. Galois groups and transcendence\nIn this section we first recall the linear independence criterion introduced in [2] by\nAnderson, Brownawell, and the author, and one of its applications to t-motives. We\nthen link this together with our study of the Galois groups of certain t-motives, whose\nmatrices representing multiplication by \u03c3 have entries in k[t] and whose fundamental\nmatrices have entries in E. These t-motives include as a subset rigid analytically trivial\nAnderson t-motives. In what follows our primary goal will be to consider the fundamental matrix \u03a8 associated to such a t-motive M and to equate the transcendence degree\nover k of \u03a8(\u03b8) and the dimension of the Galois group of M .\n5.1. Linear independence criterion.\nTheorem 5.1.1 ([2, Thm. 3.1.1]). Let \u03a6 \u2208 Matr (k[t]) be given such that det \u03a6 =\n\u00d7\nc(t \u2212 \u03b8)s , c \u2208 k , and suppose that \u03c8 \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (E) satisfies\n\u03c8 (\u22121) = \u03a6\u03c8.\n\nFor every \u03c1 \u2208 Mat1\u00d7r (k) such that \u03c1\u03c8(\u03b8) = 0, there is a P \u2208 Mat1\u00d7r (k[t]) so that\nP (\u03b8) = \u03c1 and P \u03c8 = 0.\n5.1.2. Connection with solutions of \u03c3-semilinear equations. At first glance at the above\ntheorem, the solutions \u03c8 of the \u03c3-semilinear equation associated to \u03a6 are quite special in that their entries are assumed to be in E. However, the following proposition\ndemonstrates that this situation is not unusual.\nProposition 5.1.3 ([2, Prop. 3.1.3]). Suppose we are given \u03a6 \u2208 Matr (k[t]) and \u03c8 \u2208\nMatr\u00d71 (T) so that\ndet \u03a6(0) 6= 0, \u03c8 (\u22121) = \u03a6\u03c8.\nThen we necessarily have \u03c8 \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (E).\n\n5.1.4. Connection with left k[t; \u03c3]-modules. The following is a variation on [2, Prop. 4.4.3]\nwith slightly milder hypotheses. We do not assume that the representing matrix \u03a6 is\none directly associated to an Anderson t-motive. However, we do obtain the same\nequality of dimensions (with the same proof).\nProposition 5.1.5 ([2, Prop. 4.4.3]). Let \u03a6 \u2208 Matr (k[t]) and \u03c8 \u2208 Matr\u00d71 (E) be given\nas in Theorem 5.1.1. Let N be the k[t]-span in E of the entries of \u03c8, and let V be the\nk-span in k\u221e of the entries of \u03c8(\u03b8). Then rkk[t] N = dimk V .\n\n\fTANNAKIAN DUALITY FOR t-MOTIVES AND CARLITZ LOGARITHMS\n\n33\n\nProof. Let N1 := {P \u2208 Mat1\u00d7r (k[t]) | P \u03c8 = 0}. We then obtain an exact sequence of\nk[t]-modules,\n0 \u2192 N1 \u2192 Mat1\u00d7r (k[t]) \u2192 N \u2192 0,\n\nwhere the second map is given by P 7\u2192 P \u03c8. It is easy to check that this is an exact\nsequence of left k[t; \u03c3]-modules. Every k[t]-basis for N1 can be extended to a basis of\nMat1\u00d7r (k[t]), and so the number of k-linearly independent relations of k-linear dependence among the entries of \u03c8(\u03b8) is at least as great as rkk[t] N1 . Thus rkk[t] N \u2265 dimk V .\nMoreover, Theorem 5.1.1 implies that every k-linear relation among the entries of \u03c8(\u03b8)\nlifts to a k[t]-linear relation among the entries of \u03c8. Thus rkk[t] N \u2264 dimk V .\n\u0003\n5.2. Dimensions and transcendence degrees.\n5.2.1. Rigid analytic trivializations over E. Let M be a t-motive. Suppose that \u03a6 \u2208\nGLr (k(t)) \u2229 Matr (k[t]) represents multiplication by \u03c3 on M and that det \u03a6 = c(t \u2212 \u03b8)s ,\n\u00d7\nc \u2208 k . An important observation is that by Propositions 3.3.9(c) and 5.1.3, there is a\nrigid analytic trivialization \u03a8 for \u03a6 such that \u03a8 \u2208 GLr (T) \u2229 Matr (E).\nTheorem 5.2.2. Let M be a t-motive, and let \u0393M be its Galois group. Suppose that\n\u03a6 \u2208 GLr (k(t)) \u2229 Matr (k[t]) represents multiplication by \u03c3 on M and that det \u03a6 =\n\u00d7\nc(t \u2212 \u03b8)s , c \u2208 k . Let \u03a8 be a rigid analytic trivialization of \u03a6 in GLr (T) \u2229 Matr (E).\nFinally, let L be the subfield of k\u221e generated over k by the entries of \u03a8(\u03b8). Then\ntr. degk L = dim \u0393M .\nProof. By Theorem 4.5.10, the groups \u0393M and \u0393\u03a8 are isomorphic. Moreover, by Theorem 4.3.1, their dimension is the same as tr. degk(t) \u039b, where \u039b = k(t)(\u03a8) \u2286 L. Now\nlet Q = k[\u03a8(\u03b8)] \u2286 L, and let S = k(t)[\u03a8] \u2286 \u039b. Then as rings,\nQ\u223c\n= k[Xij ]/a,\n\nS\u223c\n= k(t)[Xij ]/b,\n\nfor ideals a and b. For d \u2265 1, let k[Xij ]d and ad denote the elements of k[Xij ] and\na of total degree \u2264 d, and let Qd \u2286 Q correspond to their quotient. Similarly define\nk(t)[Xij ]d , bd , and Sd .\nFix d \u2265 1. Now for any n \u2265 1, the entries of \u03a8\u2297n comprise all monomials of\ntotal degree n in the \u03a8ij . If \u03c8 is a column of \u03a8\u2297n , then \u03c8 (\u22121) = \u03a6\u2297n \u03c8. Thus let\n\u03c8 \u2208 MatN \u00d71 (E) be the column vector whose entries are the concatenation of 1 and\neach of the columns of \u03a8\u2297n for n \u2264 d. (Here N = (r2d+2 \u2212 1)/(r2 \u2212 1).) Then if\n\u03a6 \u2208 MatN (k[t]) \u2229 GLN (k(t)) is the block diagonal matrix\n\u0001\u2295rd\n\u0001\u2295r2\n,\n\u2295 * * * \u03a6\u2297d\n\u03a6 := [1] \u2295 \u03a6\u2295r \u2295 \u03a6\u22972\n(\u22121)\n\nit follows that \u03c8\n= \u03a6 \u03c8. Now it is easy to see that Qd is the k-span of the columns\nof \u03c8(\u03b8) and that Sd is the k(t)-span of the columns of \u03c8. Since \u03a6 and \u03c8 satisfy the\nhypotheses for Proposition 5.1.5, we see that for all d \u2265 1,\ndimk Qd = dimk(t) Sd .\nThus the homogenizations of Q and S have the same Hilbert series (see [34, Ch. VII,\n\u0003\n\u00a712]), and so tr. degk L = tr. degk(t) \u039b.\n6. Application to Carlitz logarithms\n6.1. Carlitz logarithms and t-motives.\n\n\f34\n\nMATTHEW A. PAPANIKOLAS\n\n6.1.1.

As in \u00a74.2, we can construct\nthe coordinate ring as the image of \u03bc : Fq (t)[X, 1/ det X] \u2192 L \u2297k(t) L, the Fq (t)-algebra\ne = \u03a8\u22121 \u03a82 . As before let q = ker \u03bc.

It will be convenient henceforth to label the non-trivial coordinates of\nG \u2286 GLr+1 as X0 , . . . , Xr .\nBecause the Carlitz motive C is contained in X, it is an object in TX , and hence\nthere is a surjection \u03c0 : \u0393X \u0589 Gm over Fq (t) by Theorem 3.5.4. Now under \u03bd :\nk(t)[X0 , X0\u22121 , X1 , . . . , Xr ] \u2192 L, which takes X to \u03a8, we have \u03bd(X0 ) = \u03a9. Thus the\naction of any \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393X (Fq (t)) on \u03a9 agrees with the action of the X0 -coordinate of \u03b3 on\n\u03a9.

Thus we can think of V \u2286 Gra with coordinates X1 , . . . , Xr .\nProposition 6.2.3. With notation as above, the group V is a linear subspace of Gra\nover Fq (t).\n\nProof. Since \u0393X is a smooth over Fq (t) by Theorem 4.3.1, one verifies that the map \u03c0\nis surjective on Lie algebras, and hence V is also smooth. Thus it is determined by the\nZariski closure of V (Fq (t)) in Gra . Because \u03c0 is surjective, for any non-zero \u03b1 \u2208 Fq (t),\n\u0003\n\u0002\nwe can choose \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393X (Fq (t)) so that \u03c0(\u03b3) = \u03b1.

Continuing in this way we see that if f has a pole at t = \u03b8, then it must\nhave a pole at each t = \u03b8(\u2212i) , i \u2265 1, which is not possible. By a similar argument we\ndeduce that f (\u22121) is also regular at t = \u03b8.

For part (c), part\n(a) implies that dimk N \u2264 dim \u0393X , since the defining polynomials for \u0393X generate a set\nof k-linear relations on \u03c0\ne, logC (\u03b11 ), . . . , logC (\u03b1r ) of dimension r +1\u2212dim \u0393X .

Let \u03b6\u03b8 = q\u22121 \u2212\u03b8, let X be the t-motive X(\u03b6\u03b8 ) of dimension 2 over k(t),\nand let \u03a8 = \u03a8(\u03b6\u03b8 ). Since \u03b6\u03b8 satisfies Ct (\u03b6\u03b8 ) = \u03b8\u03b6\u03b8 + \u03b6\u03b8q = 0, we see that \u03b6\u03b8 is a t-torsion\npoint on the Carlitz module. Moreover, expC (\u03b8 logC (\u03b6\u03b8 )) = 0, and one calculates that\nlogC (\u03b6\u03b8 ) =\n\n\u03c0\ne\n.\n\u03b8\n\nThus \u0393X is 1-dimensional by Theorem 6.3.2(c). If we consider the function in T\n\u03a5 := tL\u03b6\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b6\u03b8 (t \u2212 \u03b8),\nthen \u03a5(\u22121) = \u03a5/(t \u2212 \u03b8). Thus \u03a5 = f /\u03a9 for some f \u2208 Fq [t] by Lemma 3.3.5. Evaluation\nat t = \u03b8 shows that f = \u22121 identically. Therefore, Z\u03a8 is defined by\nZ\u03a8 : \u03b6\u03b8 (t \u2212 \u03b8)X0 \u2212 tX1 \u2212 1 = 0.\nIt follows that the defining equation for \u0393X is\n\u0393X : tX1 \u2212 X0 + 1 = 0.\nIn the notation of Theorem 6.3.2, we have\nF := X1 ,\nG := tX1 \u2212 X0 + 1,\n\nb0 := t + 1,\nH := G \u2212 f X0 ,\n\nb1 := 1\nf := \u03b6\u03b8 (t \u2212 \u03b8) \u2212 1.\n\n6.4.
