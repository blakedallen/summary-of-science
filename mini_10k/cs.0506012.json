A non-cooperative power control game\nis considered in which each user seeks to choose a transmit\npower that maximizes its own utility while satisfying the user's\ndelay requirements. The utility function measures the number of\nreliable bits transmitted per joule of energy and the user's delay\nconstraint is modeled as an upper bound on the delay outage\nprobability. The Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is derived, and its existence and uniqueness are proved. Using a largesystem analysis, explicit expressions for the utilities achieved at\nequilibrium are obtained for the matched filter, decorrelating and\nminimum mean square error multiuser detectors. The effects\nof delay constraints on the users' utilities (in bits/Joule) and\nnetwork capacity (i.e., the maximum number of users that can\nbe supported) are quantified.\n\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nIn wireless networks, power control is used for resource\nallocation and interference management. In multiple-access\nCDMA systems such as the uplink of cdma2000, the purpose\nof power control is for each user terminal to transmit enough\npower so that it can achieve the desired quality of service\n(QoS) without causing unnecessary interference for other users\nin the network. Depending on the particular application, QoS\ncan be expressed in terms of throughput, delay, battery life,\netc. Since in many practical situations, the users' terminals\nare battery-powered, an efficient power management scheme\nis required to prolong the battery life of the terminals. Hence,\npower control plays an even more important role in such\nscenarios.\nConsider a multiple-access DS-CDMA network where each\nuser wishes to locally and selfishly choose its transmit power\nso as to maximize its utility and at the same time satisfy\nits delay requirements. The strategy chosen by each user\naffects the performance of other users through multiple-access\ninterference. There are several questions to ask concerning this\ninteraction. First of all, what is a reasonable choice of a utility\nfunction that measures energy efficiency and takes into account\ndelay constraints? Secondly, given such a utility function, what\nstrategy should a user choose in order to maximize its utility?\nIf every user in the network selfishly and locally picks its\nutility-maximizing strategy, will there be a stable state at which\nThis research was supported by the National Science Foundation under\nGrant ANI-03-38807.\n\nno user can unilaterally improve its utility (Nash equilibrium)?\nIf such an equilibrium exists, will it be unique? What will be\nthe effect of delay constraint on the energy efficiency of the\nnetwork?\nGame theory is the natural framework for modeling and\nstudying such a power control problem. Recently, there has\nbeen a great deal of interest in applying game theory to\nresource allocation is wireless networks. Examples of gametheoretic approaches to power control are found in [1\u20138].\nIn [1\u20135], power control is modeled as a non-cooperative\ngame in which users choose their transmit powers in order\nto maximize their utilities. In [8], the authors extend this\napproach to consider a game in which users can choose their\nuplink receivers as well as their transmit powers. All the\npower control games proposed so far assume that the traffic\nis not delay sensitive. Their focus is entirely on the trade-offs\nbetween throughput and energy consumption without taking\ninto account any delay constraints. In this work, we propose\na non-cooperative power control game that does take into\naccount a transmission delay constraint for each user. Our\nfocus here is on energy efficiency. Our approach allows us\nto study networks with both delay tolerant and delay sensitive\ntraffic/users and quantify the loss in energy efficiency due to\nthe presence of users with stringent delay constraints.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we\npresent the system model and define the users' utility function\nas well as the model used for incorporating delay constraints.\nThe proposed power control game is described in Section III,\nand the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the\nproposed game is discussed in Section IV. In Section V, we\nextend the analysis to multi-class networks and derive explicit\nexpressions for the utilities achieved at Nash equilibrium.\nNumerical results and conclusions are given in Sections VI\nand VII, respectively.\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\nWe consider a synchronous DS-CDMA network with K\nusers and processing gain N (defined as the ratio of symbol\nduration to chip duration). We assume that all K user terminals\ntransmit to a receiver at a common concentration point, such\nas a cellular base station or any other network access point.\nThe signal received by the uplink receiver (after chip-matched\nfiltering) sampled at the chip rate over one symbol duration\n\n\fcan be expressed as\nr=\n\nB. Delay Constraints\nK\nX\n\n\u221a\npk hk bk sk + w,\n\n(1)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere pk , hk , bk and sk are the transmit power, channel\ngain, transmitted bit and spreading sequence of the k th user,\nrespectively, and w is the noise vector which is assumed to be\nGaussian with mean 0 and covariance \u03c3 2 I. We assume random\nspreading sequences for all users, i.e., sk = \u221a1N [v1 ...vN ]T ,\nwhere the vi 's are independent and identically distributed\n(i.i.d.) random variables taking values in {\u22121, +1} with equal\nprobabilities.\n\nLet X represent the (random) number of transmissions\nrequired for a packet to be received without any errors. The\nassumption is that if a packet has one or more errors, it\nwill be retransmitted. We also assume that retransmissions are\nindependent from each other. It is clear that the transmission\ndelay for a packet is directly proportional to X. Therefore,\nany constraint on the transmission delay can be equivalently\nexpressed as a constraint on the number of transmissions.\nAssuming that the packet success rate is given by the efficiency\nfunction f (\u03b3)1 , the probability that exactly m transmissions\nare required for the successful transmission of the packet is\ngiven by\nPr{X = m} = f (\u03b3) (1 \u2212 f (\u03b3))m\u22121 ,\n\nA. Utility Function\nTo pose the power control problem as a non-cooperative\ngame, we first need to define a suitable utility function. It is\nclear that a higher signal to interference plus noise ratio (SIR)\nlevel at the output of the receiver will result in a lower bit\nerror rate and hence higher throughput. However, achieving a\nhigh SIR level requires the user terminal to transmit at a high\npower which in turn results in low battery life. This tradeoff\ncan be quantified (as in [1]) by defining the utility function of\na user to be the ratio of its throughput to its transmit power,\ni.e.,\nTk\nuk =\n.\n(2)\npk\nThroughput is the net number of information bits that are\ntransmitted without error per unit time (sometimes referred\nto as goodput). It can be expressed as\nL\nRk f (\u03b3k ),\n(3)\nTk =\nM\nwhere L and M are the number of information bits and\nthe total number of bits in a packet, respectively. Rk and\n\u03b3k are the transmission rate and the SIR for the k th user,\nrespectively; and f (\u03b3k ) is the \"efficiency function\" which\nis assumed to be increasing and S-shaped (sigmoidal) with\nf (\u221e) = 1. We also require that f (0) = 0 to ensure that\nuk = 0 when pk = 0. In general, the efficiency function\ndepends on the modulation, coding and packet size. A more\ndetailed discussion of the efficiency function can be found in\n[8]. Note that for a sigmoidal efficiency function, the utility\nfunction in (2) is a quasiconcave function of the user's transmit\npower. The throughput Tk in (3) could also be replaced with\nany increasing concave function such as the Shannon capacity\nformula as long as we make sure that uk = 0 when pk = 0.\nBased on (2) and (3), the utility function for user k can be\nwritten as\nL f (\u03b3k )\nuk =\n.\n(4)\nR\nM\npk\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have assumed that the transmission rate is the same for all users, i.e., R1 = ... = RK = R.\nAll the results obtained here can be easily generalized to the\ncase of unequal rates. The utility function in (4), which has\nunits of bits/Joule, captures very well the tradeoff between\nthroughput and battery life and is particularly suitable for\napplications where energy efficiency is crucial.\n\n(5)\n\n1\n. We model the delay requirements\nand, hence, E{X} = f (\u03b3)\nof a particular user (or equivalently traffic type) as a pair\n(D, \u03b2), where\nPr{X \u2264 D} \u2265 \u03b2.\n(6)\n\nIn other words, we would like the number of transmissions to\nbe at most D with a probability larger than or equal to \u03b2. For\nexample, (2, 0.9), i.e., D = 2 and \u03b2 = 0.9, implies that 90%\nof the time we need at most two transmissions to successfully\nreceive a packet. Note that (6) can equivalently be represented\nas an upper bound on the delay outage probability, i.e.,\nPdelay\n\noutage\n\n, Pr{X > D} \u2264 1 \u2212 \u03b2.\n\n(7)\n\nBased on (5), the delay constraint in (6) can be expressed\nas\n\nD\nX\n\nm=1\n\nor\n\nm\u22121\n\nf (\u03b3) (1 \u2212 f (\u03b3))\n\n\u2265 \u03b2,\n\nf (\u03b3) \u2265 \u03b7(D, \u03b2),\nwhere\n\n(8)\n1\n\n\u03b7(D, \u03b2) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2) D .\n\n(9)\n\nHere, we have explicitly shown that \u03b7 is a function of D and \u03b2.\nSince f (\u03b3) is an increasing function of \u03b3, we can equivalently\nexpress (8) as\n\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b3\u0303,\n(10)\nwhere\n\u03b3\u0303 = f \u22121 (\u03b7(D, \u03b2)) .\n\n(11)\n\nTherefore, the delay constraint in (6) translates into a lower\nbound on the SIR. Since different users could have different\ndelay requirements, \u03b3\u0303 is user dependent. We make this explicit\nby writing\n\u03b3\u0303k = f \u22121 (\u03b7k ) ,\n(12)\n1\n\nwhere \u03b7k = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2k ) Dk . A more stringent delay requirement, i.e., a smaller D and/or a larger \u03b2, will result in a higher\nvalue for \u03b3\u0303. Without loss of generality, we have assumed that\nall the users in the network have the same efficiency function.\nIt is straightforward to relax this assumption.\n1 This assumption is valid in many practical systems (see [8] for further\ndetails).\n\n\fIII. P OWER C ONTROL G AME WITH D ELAY C ONSTRAINTS\nWe propose a power control game in which each user\ndecides how much power to transmit in order to maximize its\nown utility and at the same time satisfy its delay requirements.\nWe have shown in Section II-B that the delay requirements\nof a user translate into a lower bound on the user's output\nSIR. Therefore, each user will seek to maximize its utility\nwhile satisfying its SIR requirement. This can be captured by\ndefining a delay-constrained utility for user k as\n\u001a\nuk\nif \u03b3k \u2265 \u03b3\u0303k\n,\n(13)\n\u0169k =\n0\nif \u03b3k < \u03b3\u0303k\n\nwhere uk and \u03b3\u0303k are given by (4) and (12), respectively.\nLet G\u0303 = [K, {Ak }, {\u0169k }] denote the proposed noncooperative game where K = {1, ..., K}, and Ak = [0, Pmax ],\nwhich is the strategy set for the k th user. Here, Pmax is the\nmaximum allowed power for transmission. We assume that\nonly those users whose delay requirements can be met are\nadmitted into the network. For example, for the conventional\nmatched filter, this translates into having\nK\nX\n\nk=1\n\n1\n< 1.\n1 + \u03b3\u0303Nk\n\nThis assumption makes sense because admitting a user that\ncannot meet its delay requirement only causes unnecessary\ninterference for other users.\nThe resulting non-cooperative game can be expressed as the\nfollowing maximization problem:\nmax \u0169k for k = 1, ..., K,\npk\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the pk 's are constrained to be non-negative. The above\nmaximization can equivalently be written as\nmax uk subject to \u03b3k \u2265 \u03b3\u0303k for k = 1, ..., K.\npk\n\n(15)\n\nLet us first solve the above maximization by ignoring the\nconstraints on SIR. For all linear receivers, we have\n\u03b3k\n\u2202\u03b3k\n=\n.\n(16)\n\u2202pk\npk\nTaking the derivative of uk with respect to pk and taking\nadvantage of (16), we obtain\n\u2202uk\nf \u2032 (\u03b3k ) \u2202\u03b3k\nf (\u03b3k )\n\u03b3k f \u2032 (\u03b3k ) \u2212 f (\u03b3k )\n=\n\u2212\n=\n.\n\u2202pk\npk \u2202pk\np2k\np2k\nTherefore, the unconstrained utility function for user k is\nmaximized when the user's output SIR is equal to \u03b3 \u2217 , where\n\u03b3 \u2217 is the (positive) solution to\nf (\u03b3) = \u03b3 f \u2032 (\u03b3).\n\n(17)\n\nIt can be shown that for a sigmoidal efficiency function, \u03b3 \u2217\nalways exists and is unique. In addition, for all \u03b3k < \u03b3 \u2217 , uk\nis increasing in pk and for all \u03b3k > \u03b3 \u2217 , uk is decreasing in\npk [9]. Therefore, \u0169k is maximized when user k transmits at\na power level that achieves \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 at the output of the uplink\nreceiver, where\n\u03b3\u0303k\u2217 = max{\u03b3\u0303k , \u03b3 \u2217 }.\n(18)\nIn the next section, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for our proposed game.\n\nIV. NASH E QUILIBRIUM\n\nFOR THE\n\nP ROPOSED G AME\n\nThe Nash equilibrium for the proposed game is a set\nstrategies (power levels) for which no user can unilaterally\nimprove its own (delay-constrained) utility function. We now\nstate the following proposition.\nProposition 1: The Nash equilibrium for the noncooperative game G\u0303 is given by p\u0303\u2217k = min{p\u2217k , Pmax }, for\nk = 1, * * * , K, where p\u2217k is the transmit power that results\nin an SIR equal to \u03b3\u0303 \u2217 at the output of the receiver with\n\u03b3\u0303k\u2217 = max{\u03b3\u0303k , \u03b3 \u2217 }. Furthermore, this equilibrium is unique.\nProof: Based on the arguments presented in Section III,\n\u0169k is maximized when the transmit power pk is such that \u03b3k =\n\u03b3\u0303k\u2217 = max{\u03b3\u0303k , \u03b3 \u2217 }. If \u03b3\u0303k cannot be achieved, the user must\ntransmit at maximum power level to maximize its utility. Let us\ndefine p\u0303k as the power level for which the output SIR for user\nk is equal to \u03b3\u0303k . Since user k is admitted into the network only\nif it can meet its delay requirements, we have p\u0303k \u2264 Pmax . In\naddition, because \u0169k = 0 for pk < p\u0303k , there is no incentive for\nuser k to transmit at a power level smaller than p\u0303k . Therefore,\nwe can restrict the set of strategies for user k to [p\u0303k , Pmax ].\nIn this interval, \u0169k = uk and hence the utility function is\ncontinuous and quasiconcave. This guarantees existence of a\nNash equilibrium for the proposed power control game.\nFurthermore, for a sigmoidal efficiency function, \u03b3 \u2217 , which\nis the (positive) solution of f (\u03b3) = \u03b3 f \u2032 (\u03b3), is unique and as\na result \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 is unique for k = 1, 2, ..., K. Because of this and\nthe one-to-one correspondence between the transmit power and\nthe output SIR, the Nash equilibrium is unique.\nThe above proposition suggests that at Nash equilibrium,\nthe output SIR for user k is \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 , where \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 depends on the\nefficiency function through \u03b3 \u2217 as well as user k's delay\nconstraint through \u03b3\u0303k . Note that this result does not depend on\nthe choice of the receiver and is valid for all linear receivers\nincluding the matched filter, the decorrelator and the (linear)\nminimum mean square error (MMSE) detector.\nV. M ULTI - CLASS N ETWORKS\nLet us now consider a network with C classes of users. The\nassumption is that all the users in the same class have the same\ndelay requirements characterized by the corresponding D and\n\u03b2. Based on Proposition 1, at Nash equilibrium, all the users in\nclass c will have the same\u0001 output SIR, \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) = max{\u03b3\u0303 (c) , \u03b3 \u2217 },\nwhere \u03b3\u0303 (c) = f \u22121 \u03b7 (c) . Here, \u03b7 (c) depends on the delay\nrequirements of class c, namely D(c) and \u03b2 (c) , through (9).\nThe goal is to quantify the effect of delay constraints on the\nenergy efficiency of the network or equivalently on the users'\nutilities.\nIn order to obtain explicit expressions for the utilities\nachieved at equilibrium, we use a large-system analysis similar\nto the one presented in [10] and [11]. We consider the\nasymptotic case in which K, N \u2192 \u221e and K\nN \u2192 \u03b1 < \u221e. This\nallows us to write SIR expressions that are independent of the\nspreading sequences of the users. Let K (c) be the number of\n(c)\nusers in class c, and define \u03b1(c) = limK,N \u2192\u221e KN . Therefore,\nPC\nwe have c=1 \u03b1(c) = \u03b1.\nIt can be shown that for the matched filter (MF), the\ndecorrelator (DE), and the MMSE detector, the minimum\n\n\f11\n\npower required by user k in class c to achieve an output SIR\nequal to \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) is given by the following equations:\n=\n\n1\n\u03b3\u0303\n\u03c3\nP\n(c) \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\nh2k 1 \u2212 C\n\u03b1\nc=1\n\n10\n\nC\nX\n\nfor\n\n\u03b1(c) \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) < 1,(19)\n\nc=1\n\npDE\nk\n\n1 \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) \u03c3 2\n= 2\nhk 1 \u2212 \u03b1\n\nfor \u03b1 < 1,\n\n(20)\n\nFig. 1.\n\nNote that we have implicitly assumed that Pmax is sufficiently\nlarge so that the target SIRs (i.e., \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) 's) can be achieved by\nall users. Furthermore, since \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) \u2265 \u03b3\u0303 (c) for c = 1, * * * , C,\n\u2217(c)\nL\nwe have \u0169k = uk = M\nR f (\u03b3\u0303pk ) . Therefore, for the matched\nfilter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE detector, the utilities\nachieved at the Nash equilibrium are given by\n1\u2212\n\nC\nX\n\n(c) \u2217(c)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b3\u0303\n\nc=1\nC\nX\n\nfor\n\n!\n\nf (\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) )\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\n\n\u03b1(c) \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) < 1, (22)\n\nc=1\n\n\u0169DE\nk\n\nLR 2\n=\nhk\nM \u03c32\n\n1\u2212\n\nC\nX\n\n(c)\n\n\u03b1\n\nc=1\n\n!\n\nf (\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) )\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\nC\nX\n\nfor\n\n\u03b1(c) < 1,\n\n(23)\n\nc=1\n\nand\nM SE\n\u0169M\nk\n\nLR 2\nh\n=\nM \u03c32 k\n\n1\u2212\n\nC\nX\n\n(c)\n\n\u03b1\n\nc=1\n\nfor\n\nC\nX\n\nc=1\n\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\n1 + \u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\n\n\u03b1(c)\n\n!\n\nf (\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c) )\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\n\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2217(c)\n< 1.

This means that the MMSE reciever\nk\nk\nk\nachieves the highest utility as compared to the decorrelator and\nthe matched filter. Also, the network capacity (i.e., the number\nof users that can be admitted into the network) is the highest\nwhen the MMSE detector is used.

(27)\n1 + \u03b3\u2217\n\nComparing (22)\u2013(24) with (25)\u2013(27), we observe that the\npresence of users with stringent delay requirements results\nnot only in a reduction in the utilities of those users but\n\nTarget SIR, \u03b3\u0303 \u2217 , as a Function of \u03b2 for D =1,2, and 3.\n\nalso a reduction in the utilities of other users in the network.\nA stringent delay requirement results in an increase in the\nuser's target SIR (remember \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 = max{\u03b3\u0303k , \u03b3 \u2217 }). Since f (\u03b3)\n\u03b3 is\nmaximum when \u03b3 = \u03b3 \u2217 , a target SIR larger than \u03b3 \u2217 results in\na reduction in the utility of the corresponding user. In addition,\nbecause of the higher target SIR for this user, other users in the\nnetwork experience a higher level of interference and hence are\nforced to transmit at a higher power which in turn results in a\nreduction in their utilities (except for the decorrelator, in which\ncase the multiple-access interference\nis completely removed).\nPC\n(c)\nAlso, since \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 \u2265 \u03b3 \u2217 and\n\u03b1\n= \u03b1, the presence\nc=1\nof delay-constrained users causes a reduction in the system\ncapacity (again, except for the decorrelator). Through (22)\u2013\n(24), we have quantified the loss in the utility (in bits/Joule)\nand in network capacity due to users' delay constraints for the\nmatched filter, the decorrelator and the MMSE receiver. The\nsensitivity of the loss to the delay parameters (i.e., D and \u03b2)\ndepends on the efficiency function, f (\u03b3).\nVI. N UMERICAL R ESULTS\nLet us consider the uplink of a DS-CDMA system with\nprocessing gain 100. We assume that each packet contains\n100 bits of information and no overhead (i.e., L = M =\n100). The transmission rate, R, is 100Kbps and the thermal\nnoise power, \u03c3 2 , is 5 \u00d7 10\u221216 W atts. A useful example for\nthe efficiency function is f (\u03b3) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b3 )M . This serves\nas an approximation to the packet success rate that is very\nreasonable for moderate to large values of M [3]. We use\nthis efficiency function for our simulations. Using this, with\nM = 100, the solution to (17) is \u03b3 \u2217 = 6.48 = 8.1dB.\nFig. 1 shows the target SIR as a function of \u03b2 for D = 1, 2,\nand 3. It is observed that, as expected, a more stringent delay\nrequirement (i.e., a higher \u03b2 and/or a lower D) results in a\nhigher target SIR.\nWe now consider a network where the users can be divided\ninto two classes: delay sensitive (class A) and delay tolerant\n(class B). For users in class A, we choose DA = 1 and\n\u03b2A = 0.99 (i.e., delay sensitive). For users in class B, we\nlet DB = 3 and \u03b2B = 0.90 (i.e., delay tolerant). Based on\n\u2217\n\u2217\nthese choices, \u03b3\u0303A\n= 9.6dB and \u03b3\u0303B\n= \u03b3 \u2217 = 8.1dB. Without\nloss of generality and to keep the comparison fair, we also\nassume that all the users are 100 meters away from the uplink\n\n\f1\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\nRatio of Utilities\n\nRatio of Utilities\n\n1\n0.9\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\nu\nA\nu\nB\nu\nA\nu\nB\nu\nA\nuB\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n/\n\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\n\n(MF)\n(MF)\n(DE)\n(DE)\n(MMSE)\n(MMSE)\n\n0.5\nu\nA\nuB\nu\nA\nu\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\nB\n\n/\n/\n/\n/\n\nu\nu\nu\nu\n\n(DE)\n(DE)\n(MMSE)\n(MMSE)\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n\u03b1 /\u03b1\nA\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n\u03b1 /\u03b1\nA\n\nFig. 2.

The system load is assumed to be \u03b1 (i.e., K\nN = \u03b1)\nand we let \u03b1A and \u03b1B represent the load corresponding to\nclass A and class B, respectively, with \u03b1A + \u03b1B = \u03b1.\nWe first consider a lightly loaded network with \u03b1 = 0.1\n(see Fig. 2). To demonstrate the performance loss due to the\npresence of users with stringent delay requirements (i.e., class\nA), we plot uuA and uuB as a function of the fraction of the load\ncorresponding to class A users (i.e., \u03b1\u03b1A ). Here, uA and uB are\nthe utilities of users in class A and class B, respectively, and\nu represents the utility of the users if they all had loose delay\nrequirements which means \u03b3\u0303k\u2217 = \u03b3 \u2217 for all k. Fig. 2 shows\nthe loss for the matched filter, the decorrelator, and the MMSE\ndetector. We observe from the figure that for the matched filter\nboth classes of users suffer significantly due to the presence\nof delay sensitive traffic. For example, when half of the users\nare delay sensitive, the utilities achieved by class A and class\nB users are, respectively, 50% and 60% of the utilities for the\ncase of no delay constraints. For the decorrelator, only class\nA users suffer and the reduction in utility is smaller than that\nof the matched filter. For the MMSE detector, the reduction in\nutility for class A users is similar to that of the decorrelator,\nand the reduction in utility for class B is negligible.\nWe repeat the experiment for a highly loaded network with\n\u03b1 = 0.9 (see Fig. 3). Since the matched filter cannot handle\nsuch a significant load, we have shown the plots for the decorrelator and MMSE detector only. We observe from Fig. 3 that\nbecause of the higher system load, the reduction in the utilities\nis more significant for the MMSE detector compared to the\ncase of \u03b1 = 0.1. It should be noted that for the decorrelator\nthe reduction in utility of class A users is independent of\nthe system load. This is because the decorrelator completely\nremoves the multiple-access interference.\nIt should be further noted that in Figs. 2 and 3 we have\nonly plotted the ratio of the utilities (not the actual values).\nAs discussed in Section V, the achieved utilities for the MMSE\ndetector are larger than those of the decorrelator and the\nmatched filter.\n\nwhere each user seeks to choose a transmit power that\nmaximizes its own utility while satisfying the user's delay\nrequirements. The utility function measures the number of\nreliable bits transmitted per joule of energy. We have modeled\nthe delay constraint as an upper bound on the delay outage\nprobability. We have derived the Nash equilibrium for the\nproposed game and have shown that it is unique. The results\nare applicable to all linear receivers. In addition, we have used\na large-system analysis to derive explicit expressions for the\nutilities achieved at equilibrium for the matched filter, decorrelator and MMSE detector. The reductions in the users' utilities\n(in bits/Joule) and network capacity due to the presence of\nusers with stringent delay constraints have been quantified.\n\nVII.
