Pascoli I-06123, Perugia, Italy\n\nAbstract\nWe discuss the values of resonance peaks of the cross\u2013section of\na heavy quark bound state obtained by means of a Green function\nmethod applied to a Coulombic model and compare the result to the\n\u03a5 and J/\u03c8 data.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe total cross\u2013section of a heavy quark bound state resonance in an\ne+ e\u2212 annihilation is described by the Breit\u2013Wigner formula\n\u221a\n3\u03c0\n\u0393ee \u0393\n(1)\n\u03c3( s) = 2 \u221a\nM ( s \u2212 M )2 + \u03932 /4\n\u221a\nwhere M is the mass of the resonance, s the centre of mass energy,\n\u0393 the total width and \u0393ee the decay width into electrons.\nFor a bound state however a better analytical description of its\ntotal cross\u2013section is given by the imaginary part of the Green function of the bound state itself [1, 2, 3]. The basic idea is to consider\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the bound state and compute its Green\nfunction\n(H \u2212 E)G(x, y, E) = \u03b4(x \u2212 y)\n(2)\nwhere H is the Hamiltonian of the system\nH=\u2212\n\u2217\n\n\u22072x\n+ V (x).\n2m\n\nnicola.fabiano@pg.infn.it\n\n1\n\n(3)\n\n\fThe imaginary part of the derivative of the Green function given by (2)\ntaken at the origin is proportional to the cross\u2013section at threshold.\nThe finite width of the state is taken into account by the substitution\nE \u2192 E + i\u0393, E being the energy offset from 2m threshold. So for the\ntotal cross\u2013section we obtain\n\u03c3(E, \u0393) \u223c \u03c3e+ e\u2212 IG(0, 0, E + i\u0393)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c3e+ e\u2212 accounts for the e+ e\u2212 part of the process and depends\non the energy solely by the function 1/s if the energy of the process\nis below the Z threshold. That is, this formula involves only the photon propagator and not the Z exchange together with its interference\neffect. The other factors depend on the particular process taken into\naccount and are not universal [4, 5]. We have therefore factored eq. (4)\nin a product of terms, the first one for the e+ e\u2212 process and the second\none for the hadronic part of cross\u2013section.\n\n2\n\nThe Green function method\n\nThe next step is to compute the Green function for a realistic model.\nThe Coulombic potential\nV (r) = \u2212\n\n4 \u03b1s\n3 r\n\n(5)\n\nwhere r = |x| provides an integrable system which is quite realistic for\na heavy quark bound state provided the QCD energy scale of \u03b1s is set\nto the inverse of Born radius, rB = 2/(3m\u03b12s ), see [4] and references\ntherein. In this case we are able to provide a fully analytical solution\nfor the bound state energy levels, namely\nEn = \u2212\n\n4 m\u03b12s\n9 n2\n\n(6)\n\nThe solution to problem (2) in the case of S wave is given in [5]\nwith a slight notation change\n\nG(0, 0, E + i\u0393) =\n+ log\n\nk\n\u03bc\n\n\u0012 \u0013\n\nm\n\u22122\u03bb\n4\u03c0\n\u0014\n\n\u0012\u0012\n\nk\n+\n2\u03bb\n\u0013\n\n+ \u03c8(1 \u2212 \u03bd) + 2\u03b3 \u2212 1 )]\n\np\n\n(7)\n\nwhere k = \u2212 m(E + i\u0393), \u03bb = 2\u03b1s m/3 and the wavenumber \u03bd = \u03bb/k,\n\u221a\nE = s \u2212 2m. The \u03c8 is the logarithmic derivative of Euler's Gamma\n\n2\n\n\ffunction \u0393(x), \u03b3 \u2243 0.57721 is Euler's constant and \u03bc is a soft scale\nthat cancels out in the determination of physical observables.\nBy inspection of eq. (7) we see that the main contribution for energies E close to the one of bound states (6) is given by the \u03c8 function,\nwhich has simple poles for negative integers \u2212n in the complex plane:\n\u03c8(z) = \u2212\n\"\n\u221e\nX\n\u03c8 (k) (1)\n\nk=1\n\nk!\n\n+\n\n1\n+ \u03c8(n + 1) +\nz+n\n\n\u03b6(k + 1) \u2212 \u03b6(k + 1, n + 1)] (z + n)k\n\n(8)\n\nfor z \u2192 \u2212n, where \u03c8 (k) (z) is the k-th derivative of the \u03c8(z) function\nP\n\u2212z\nwith respect to z, the so\u2013called polygamma function; \u03b6(z) = \u221e\nk=1 k\nP\u221e\n\u2212z\nis the Riemann zeta function, while \u03b6(z, q) = k=1 (k + q) is the\nHurwitz zeta function [6].\n\n3 Results of the Coulombic model for\n\u03a5 state\nAs previously discussed in sec. 1 the cross\u2013section of a heavy quark\nresonance below Z mass could be written as\n\u03c3(E, \u0393) \u223c\n\n1\nIG(0, 0, E + i\u0393)\ns\n\n(9)\n\nwhere in our particular model of Coulombic interaction G is given\nexplicitly by formula (7).\nWith (9) we are going to compute the ratio of the 2S and 1S\nresonance peaks respectively, which should be independent upon the\nparticular bound state chosen for this evaluation. In fact one obtains\nthe following expression\nM2\nIG(0, 0, E2S + i\u03932S )\n\u03c3(E2S , \u03932S )\n= 1S\n2 \u00d7 IG(0, 0, E\n\u03c3(E1S , \u03931S )\nM2S\n1S + i\u03931S )\n\n(10)\n\nwhich will be renamed as \u03c3(2)/\u03c3(1) for sake of brevity. The first term\nof RHS of eq. (10) is close to 1, and from eq. (6) the mass of the bound\nstate is given by\n2 \u03b12s\nMn = 2m + En = 2m 1 \u2212\n9 n2\n\n!\n\n2 /M 2 is given by 1 + \u03b12 /3 + O(\u03b14 ).\nso that the ratio M2S\ns\ns\n1S\n\n3\n\n(11)\n\n\fDefining a suitable variable depending on a generic width value\nt = \u0393/E1 , with E1 given by eq. (6) for n = 1, we obtain the fairly\nelegant expression\n\u03c3(2)\n\u03c3(1)\n\n=\n\u2212\n\n+O(t6 )\n\n1\n42 \u03c0 2 + 425 t2\n+\n\u2212\n8\n128\n\u0001\n147384 \u03b6 (3) + 1134 \u03c0 4 + 11096 \u03c0 2 + 36545 t4\n+\n3072\n(12)\n\u0001\n\nwhich would suggest a value close to 1/8 for this ratio. Unfortunately\nthe (12) is a very slowly convergent series as its numeric evaluation\nshows:\n\u03c3(2)\n= 0.125 + 6.559 t2 \u2212 48.877 t4 + O(t6 )\n(13)\n\u03c3(1)\nthat is, the coefficient of O(tk ) term grows more than k! , suggesting\nto evaluate the result with the full expression of (7) for the Green\nfunction.\nWe will make use now of this method with \u03a5 resonances data.\nThis bb bound state is the ideal candidate for this method: it is rather\nheavy, mb \u223c 5 GeV, so that it should allow us to neglect the confining\nlinear term proportional to r in the QCD potential [7, 8, 9].\nFor the \u03a5(1S) PDG data [10] give us:\nM\u03a5 (1S) = 9.46030 \u00b1 0.00026 GeV ,\n\u0393(1S) = 54.02 \u00b1 1.25 keV ,\n\n\u0393ee (1S) = 1.340 \u00b1 0.018 keV ;\n\n(14)\n\nwhile for the \u03a5(2S) one reads\nM\u03a5 (2S) = 10.02326 \u00b1 0.00031 GeV ,\n\u0393(2S) = 31.98 \u00b1 2.63 keV ,\n\n\u0393ee (2S) = 0.612 \u00b1 0.011 keV .\n\n(15)\n\nPlugging all those data into the Coulombic model (5) and eq. (10)\nwe compute the ratio of the first two peaks for the \u03a5 resonance obtaining the value\n\u03c3(2)\n= 0.211 \u00b1 0.024 .\n(16)\n\u03c3(1)\nThis result is very sensitive to the exact total width value, and depends\nmuch less on both the mass of the state and the exact \u03b1s coupling of\nthe Coulombic model. It differs from first term of the series expansion (12) by approximately a factor of 2 proving its slow convergence\ndespite the smallness of its parameter t, of the order of 10\u22124 .\n\n4\n\n\f4\n\nComparison with data\n\nWe are ready now to compare our results with the \u03a5 measurements.\nFrom eq. (1) the maximal value of the Breit\u2013Wigner resonance cross\u2013\nsection is given by the expression\n\u03c3max =\n\n12\u03c0 \u0393ee\n.\nM2 \u0393\n\n(17)\n\nUsing again the experimental data of eqs. (14), (15) we have the following value for the measured ratio:\n\u0012\n\n\u03c3(2)\n\u03c3(1)\n\n\u0013\n\nexp\n\n= 0.685 \u00b1 0.094 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich is quite sensitive to the exact determination of the widths. It\nis clear that this value doesn't agree with (16); some caveats are in\norder here.\nAccording to [10, 11], because of ISR (initial state radiation) and\nBeamstrahlung effect the observed line shape is not simply given by\neq. (1) but a convolution of the \u03a5 width of O(keV), of ISR and of beam\nenergy spread of O(MeV). The \u0393ee value cannot therefore be directly\nmeasured, but is calculated from the production cross\u2013section of \u03a5\nintegrated over the incoming e+ e\u2212 energies, that is\nZ\n\n\u03c3(e+ e\u2212 \u2192 \u03a5)dE\n\n(19)\n\nThe integral itself however is again calculated from the Breit\u2013Wigner\nformula (1) in a bootstrap fashion, thus leading to a heavily model\ndependent result of the cross\u2013section shape.\nThe Coulombic model works well even at lower than \u03a5 scales [12],\nthere could be however some relativistic non negligible effect in this\ncase (recall from sec. 1 that this whole method is non\u2013relativistic).\nFrom the virial theorem applied to a Coulombic model we obtain the\nrelation between the kinetic and potential energies average \u2212hV i/2 =\nhT i that leads to a speed estimate of the component quark inside the\nmeson\n8\n(20)\nhv 2 i = \u03b12s\n9\nThis brings a \u03b3 relativistic correction of about 8% at \u03a5 scale that\ncould change the computed ratio.\n\n5\n\nFurther estimates: the J/\u03c8 case\n\nTo shed some more light on this discrepancy we have described it could\nbe useful to compare our results to the one obtained from J/\u03c8 data.\n\n5\n\n\fThis cc bound state is less ideal than the former \u03a5 for our purpose,\nas it is lighter (mc \u223c 1.5 GeV), thus linear confining terms for the\npotential as well as relativistic corrections could have larger effects.\nFrom PDG data for J/\u03c8 [10] we read:\nMJ/\u03c8 (1S) = 3096.916 \u00b1 0.011 MeV ,\n\u0393(1S) = 93.2 \u00b1 2.1 keV ,\n\n\u0393ee (1S) = 5.55 \u00b1 0.14 keV ;\n\n(21)\n\nwhile for the \u03c8(2S) one reads\nM\u03c8(2S) (2S) = 3686.09 \u00b1 0.04 MeV ,\n\u0393(2S) = 317 \u00b1 9 keV ,\n\n\u0393ee (2S) = 2.38 \u00b1 0.04 keV .\n\n(22)\n\nProceeding like described in sec. 4 we obtain for the J/\u03c8 peak measured values\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3(2)\n= 0.0890 \u00b1 0.0083 .\n(23)\n\u03c3(1) exp\nThe Green function approach method detailed in sections 2 and 3 gives\nus\n\u03c3(2)\n= 0.0368 \u00b1 0.0019 .\n(24)\n\u03c3(1)\nA comparison of eq. (24) with eq. (23) shows that the result for the\nJ/\u03c8 case is slightly worse than the one for \u03a5 as expected. In fact\nfor the former case the two central values differ for more than 27\u03c3G ,\nwhile in the latter the difference is less pronounced, above 19\u03c3G (here\n\u03c3G refers to the error given by the Green function procedure). An\nestimate of the relativistic \u03b3 correction for J/\u03c8 done in the same\nfashion of eq. (20) gives us a result of about 38%.\nThis \u03b3 correction together with the absence of a linear term in the\npotential could account for the larger difference seen at a lower energy\nscale.\nWe must stress again that this method of the Green function for\na Coulombic potential of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation furnishes us with\nan exact analytical solution given by eq. (7) only in the case of this\nparticular interaction, and only for a non\u2013relativistic system. The\naddition of further correction terms to the potential of eq. (5) like a\nlinear confining term r or a relativistic correction of order v 2 would\nspoil the integrability of this problem and thus the possibility of full\ncontrol over solutions. For instance, a Hamiltonian with a funnel\npotential like V (r) = \u22124\u03b1s /(3r)+ar or a Hamiltonian with relativistic\ncorrection H = p2 /(2m) \u2212 p4 /(8m3 ) + V (r) are not exactly solvable,\n\n6\n\n\fand even a perturbative approach is unfit in our case as corrections to\nthe original H of eqs. (3) and (5) are not small. Those systems would\ncall for a purely numerical search of results which is beyond the scope\nof this paper.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have compared the ratio of the first two cross\u2013section resonance\n\u03a5 peaks computed from a QCD model and the one obtained from the\nexperiments, given respectively by 0.211 \u00b1 0.024 and 0.685 \u00b1 0.094.\nAnother comparison is done for the J/\u03c8 case, giving a calculated\nvalue of 0.0890 \u00b1 0.0083 and an experimental one of 0.0368 \u00b1 0.0019\nfor peaks ratio. Albeit the two results do not agree with each other,\nit is necessary to consider that the theoretical model could need some\nrelativistic corrections. On the other hand, the experiments do not\ngive a direct measurement of the peaks, but rather depend on the\nmodel used to evaluate the cross\u2013section.\nTherefore it should be possible to compare again the two results\nusing more refined methods from the theoretical model side and from\nthe measure technique as well.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of N.
