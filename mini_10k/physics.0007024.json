Our\nstudy is based on using the data from about 70 GPS stations located in\nthe neighbourhood of the eclipse totality phase in Europe. The eclipse\nperiod was characterized by a low level of geomagnetic disturbance (Dstvariation from -10 to -20 nT), which alleviated significantly the problem of\ndetecting the ionospheric response to the eclipse. Our analysis revealed a\nwell-defined effect of a decrease (depression) of the total electron content\n(TEC) for all GPS stations. The delay between minimum TEC values with\nrespect to the totality phase near the eclipse path increased gradually from\n4 min in Greenwich longitude (10:40 UT, LT) to 8 min at the longitude\n16\u25e6 (12:09 LT). The depth and duration of the TEC depression were found\nto be 0.2-0.3 TECU and 60 min, respectively. The results obtained in this\nstudy are in good agreement with earlier measurements and theoretical\nestimates.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nExperimental observations of the ionosphere at the time of solar eclipses provide\nthe source of information about the character of behavior of the various ionospheric parameters. Regular ionospheric effects of solar eclipses are fairly well\nunderstood. They imply an increase of effective reflection heights, a reduction in\nconcentration in the F-layer maximum, and a decrease in total electron content\n\n1\n\n\f(TEC) in the ionosphere, which is typical of the transition to the nightside ionosphere (Cohen, 1984). The behavior of the above parameters can be modeled\nusing appropriate ionospheric models (Stubbe, 1970; Boitman et al., 2000).\nThe main parameters of the ionospheric response are the value of the delay \u03c4\nwith respect to the eclipse totality phase, as well as its amplitude A and duration\n\u2206T . Almost all publications devoted to the study of the ionospheric response\nto solar eclipses present estimates of these parameters. A knowledge of these\nvalues makes it possible to refine, in terms of the respective aeronomic ionospheric\nmodels, the time constants of ionization and recombination processes at different\nheights in the ionopshere.\nThe measurements of \u03c4 were made by analyzing the characteristics of the\nionosphere-reflected radio signal at vertical-incidence soundings at a network of\nionospheric stations (Marriott et al., 1969; Goncharov et al., 1982; Boitman et\nal., 2000) by measuring the frequency Doppler shift at vertical- and obliqueincidence soundings (Boitman et al., 2000). In the cited references, the value of\n\u03c4 was found to vary from 0 (Marriott et al., 1969) to 20 min, with the amplitude\nA of a decrease in local electron density of order 9 \u00d7 104 cm\u22123 , and the response\nduration of about 1 hour (Boitman et al., 2000).\nSimilar measurements at an ionospheric station were made during the solar\neclipse of September 23, 1987 in the south-eastern Asia (Cheng, 1992). The amplitude, delay and duration of the ionospheric response were found to be 0.3 \u00d7106\ncm\u22123 , 18 min and 1 hour 30 min, respectively. At the same time, measurements\nduring the eclipse of October 24, 1995 in the same region provided an estimate of\n\u03c4 of about 80 min (Huang, 1999), \u2206T = 1 hour 20 min, and A in excess of 1 \u00d7106\ncm\u22123 . The measurements of f0 F 2 over the Scaramanga station during a partial\nsolar eclipse of May 20, 1996 (Anastassiadis, 1970) give the value of \u03c4 of about\n38 min. In paper Zherebtsov et al. (1998a), the delay time of the ionospheric\nresponse to the eclipse was between 25 and 30 min (at 300 km altitude).\nInteresting results were obtained in observations of an annular solar eclipse\nof May 30, 1984 at the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (Salah, 1986). A\ndecrease in electron density with respect to the eclipse totality phase occurred\nin this case 20\u201330 min later, with A = 4 \u00d7 106 cm\u22123 , and \u2206T = 2 hours 15 min.\nHowever, facilities of this kind are too few to be extensively used in experiments\nduring solar eclipses.\nThe ionospheric response to the March 9, 1997 total solar eclipse was investigated using a network of ionosondes (Zherebtsov et al., 1998b). For this event,\nthe position of the minimum of the trough in the time dependence of electron\ndensity was shifted with respect to the time of maximum occultation of the solar\ndisk by 10\u201315 min, with A = 1 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 , \u2206T = 1 hour 15 min.\nA large amount of data was obtained by measuring the Faraday rotation of the\nplane of polarization of VHF signals of geostationary satellites (Klobuchar et al.,\n1970; Hunter et al., 1974; Davies,1980; Rama Rao, 1982; Essex, 1982; Deshpande,\n1982; Singh, 1989). These measurements revealed the eclipse-induced effect of\n2\n\n\fa deep depression (decrease) in TEC with the amplitude A varying from 2 to\n14 TECU, and with a typical time of TEC depression and recovery of about\nseveral hours (the unit of measurement of TEC that is adopted in the literature\ncorresponds to 1016 \u22122 ). The spread in the values of \u03c4 was also found to vary\nover a wide range, from 5 to 40 min.\nAccording to Klobuchar et al. (1970), for a total solar eclipse that occurred\nin spring (March 7, 1970), the amplitude A was 11 TECU, \u2206T = 2 hours 44\nmin, and \u03c4 of order 33 min. For the total solar eclipse of February 16, 1980,\nthe observations at Waltair (Singh, 1989) gave the following estimates: A =\n0.11 TECU, \u2206T = 1 hour, and \u03c4 = 20 min. Essex et al. (1982) inferred that for\nthe total solar eclipse of February 20, 1979, the values of A and \u03c4 are 14 TECU\nand 33 min, respectively.\nHence a large body of experimental data do not permit us to make any reliable estimates of the basic parameters of the ionospheric response. One of the\nreason for such a great difference is attributable to the use of different methods of\nmeasurements which differ greatly by spatial and temporal resolution. However,\nthe main reason is caused by dissimilar characteristics of the eclipse itself, by\ngeophysical conditions of individual measurements, and by a large difference of\nthe latitude, longitude and local time when experiments are conducted.\nTo obtain more reliable information about the behaviour of the ionosphere\nduring an eclipse, it is necessary to carry out simultaneous measurements over a\nlarge area covering regions with a different local time. Furthermore, high spatial\n(of some tens of kilometres at least) and temporal (at least 1 min) resolution is\nneeded. However, none of the above familiar methods meets such requirements.\nThe development of the global navigation system GPS and the creation, on its\nbasis, of extensive networks of GPS stations (which at the end of 1999 consisted\nof no less than 600 sites), the data from which are placed on the INTERNET\n(Klobuchar, 1997), open up a new era in remote sensing of the ionosphere. At\nalmost any point of the globe and at any time at two coherently-coupled frequencies f1 = 1575.42 MHz and f2 = 1227.60 MHz, two-frequency multichannel\nreceivers of the GPS system are used to carry out high-precision measurements\nof the group and phase delay along the line o sight between the ground-based\nreceiver and satellite-borne transmitters in the zone of reception. The sensitivity\nafforded by phase measurements in the GPS system permits irregularities to be\ndetected with an amplitude of up to 10\u22123 \u201310\u22124 of the diurnal variation of TEC.\nAfraimovich et al. (1998) were the first to use in a detailed analysis of regular\nionopsheric effects measurements of TEC and its gradients for the total solar\neclipse of March 9, 1997, using for this purpose the GPS interferometer at Irkutsk.\nTheir results bear witness to significant changes occurring in the process of ion\nproduction in the ionosphere during the solar eclipse, simultaneously in a large\nvolume of space with a radius of at least 300 km at 300 km altitude. The delay\nof a minimum TEC value with respect to the phase of totality is about 10 min,\nthe depth of TEC depression varies from 1 to 3 TECU, and \u2206T = 1 hour 15 min.\n3\n\n\fBoitman et al. (2000) obtained a good agreement of these data, as well of\nmeasurements for several HF Doppler sounding paths with results of a numerical\nsimulations using the ionosphere-plasmasphere coupling model (Krinberg, 1984).\nUnfortunately, during this eclipse the total shadow's path in 1997 was monitored\nby only few GPS stations; therefore, it was not possible to determine the spatialtemporal characteristics of the ionopsheric response.\nAccording to the data from five GPS stations reported by Tsai and Liu (1999)\nfor the solar eclipses of October 24, 1995 and March 9, 1997, the delay \u03c4 varied\nover a broad range, from 0 to 30 min, the amplitude A was close to 7 TECU, and\n\u2206T varied from 40 min to 1 hour.\nA unique opportunity to exploit the potential of the GPS network was provided by the total solar eclipse of August 11, 1999. For this period of time, the\nINTERNET made available the data from at least 100 GPS stations located in\nWestern and Central Europe within and near the totality path. A massive flow of\npublications on the various ionospheric effects of this eclipse should be forthcoming, based on the GPS data in conjunction with the data from other observing\nfacilities. The objective of this paper is to determine the basic parameters of the\nionospheric response to the August 11, 1999 total solar eclipse using these data.\nGeneral information about the eclipse, and a description of the experimental geometry are given in Section 2. The ionospheric response to the eclipse is\ndiscussed in Section 3 using the data from reference ionospheric station Chilton.\nThe processing technique for the GPS network data, and results derived from\nanalysing the ionospheric response of the August 11, 1999 solar eclipse in Europe\nare outlined in Section 4. Results obtained in this study are discussed in Section\n5.\n\n2\n\nThe geometry and general information of total solar eclipse AUGUST 11, 1999\n\nThe last solar eclipse in the 20\u2013th century began in North Atlantic, and path of\nthe Moon's shadow made first landfall in south-western England at 10:10 UT;\nthe Sun at that time was at an angle of 45\u25e6 over the eastern horizon. The centre\nline duration of total eclipse averaged 2 min, and the total eclipse was confined\nto a narrow corridor 103 km wide.\nFig. 1 shows a schematic map of the path of the Moon's shadow crossing\nparts of Western and Central Europe (the data from Espenak, 1999 were used in\nconstructing this map). The centre line of eclipse at ground level is shown as a\nthick line, and thin lines correspond to its southern and northern boundaries. The\nlocation of reference ionospheric station Chilton (RAL) is marked by the symbol\n\u22c6. Dots \u2022 and symbols + show the locations of the GPS stations used in the\nanalysis; their geographic coordinates are presented in Table 1. Dots \u2022, together\n4\n\n\fwith symbols + are used to represent a total set of GPS stations. Symbols + form\na network of GPS stations located near the eclipse path; therefore, we designated\nthis group as the near zone. Numbers for the longitudes 10\u25e6 W , 0\u25e6 , 10\u25e6 E, 20\u25e6 E,\n30\u25e6 E, 40\u25e6 E correspond to the local time for these longitudes.\nIn this paper we confine ourselves to analysing only to a region of Western and\nCentral Europe from the coast of southern England to the point with coordinates\n56.03\u25e6 N, 37.2\u25e6 E, where the totality phase was observed at 11:20 UT (14:20 LT).\nThus the solar eclipse effect occurred for the conditions of the daytime summer\nionosphere.\nThe distance along the great-circle arc between the above-mentioned extreme\npoints is about 2900 km, with the time difference of 67 min only. Hence a\ndistinguishing characteristic of this eclipse was the supersonic speed of the Moon's\nshadow sweeping through the terrestrial surface, exceeding 720 m/s.\nAt ionospheric heights the totality path was travelling somewhat further\nsouth. The onset time of the totality phase for the height h=300 km over Budapest is 1.3 min ahead of that at ground level. The difference in the values of\nthe totality phases and their onset times is caused by the Sun's altitude over the\nhorizon. At the time of the totality phase in Budapest (11:05 UT, or 14:05 LT),\nit was as small as 59\u25e6 .\nThe period under consideration was characterized by a low level of geomagnetic disturbance (Dst-variation from -10 to -20 nT), which simplified greatly the\nproblem of detecting the ionospheric response of eclipse.\n\n3\n\nThe ionospheric response by eclipse from date\nof ionospheric station Chilton\n\nFirst we consider the variations of critical frequencies f0 F 2 over the time interval\n00:00-24:00 UT on August 11, 1999 according to the data from station Chilton\n(RAL) - Fig. 2a. The onset time of the totality phase of eclipse in the area of station Chilton (RAL) at 300 km altitude is shown by a vertical solid line. As might\nbe expected under the conditions of the summer ionosphere, the mean level of\nf0 F 2 differs only slightly for the night-time and daytime. Nevertheless, a decrease\nof f0 F 2 during the totality phase of eclipse is sufficiently clearly distinguished.\nConsider the variations of ionospheric parameters for the time interval 06:00\u2013\n15:00 UT on August 11, 1999, and on the background days of August 10 and\n12, using the data from station Chilton (RAL) - Fig. 3. Dots correspond to\nvariations of critical frequencies f0 F 2 (panel a), f0 F 1 (panel c), apparent heights\nh\u2032 F (panel b), and h\u2032 F 2 (panel d) for August 11, 1999. Solid curves plot the\nsame values that are smoothed with a time window of 60 min. For August 10\nand 12, only smoothed curves are given, with the same time window of 60 min.\n\n5\n\n\fThe onset time of the totality phase of eclipse (10:16 UT) at 300 km altitude over\nthe station is shown by a thin vertical line.\nThe eclipse effect is most conspicuous in the variations of critical frequencies\nf0 F 2, whose maximum difference from the background values on August 10 and\n12 at the time of reaching a minimum (10:20 UT) was up to 2 MHz. On the\nother hand, the amplitude of a decrease of f0 F 2 for the August 11 event (after\nthe totality phase of eclipse) does not exceed 1 MHz. The eclipse effect on other\nparameters is not as clearly distinguished, and becomes evident only when comparing the smoothed curves. Similar results of measurements at an ionospheric\nstation were obtained during the total solar eclipse of September 23, 1987 in\nSouth-Eastern Asia (K. Cheng, 1992).\nThe f0 F 2 \u2013 variations, measured at station Chilton (RAL) at time intervals\nof 4 min, are presented in greater detail in Fig. 4a (heavy dots). The solid curve\nconnecting these dots is an approximating one for these values. This panel plots\nalso the geometrical function of eclipse S(t) at 300 km altitude, calculated for\nstation Chilton. Minimum values of f0 F 2 and S(t) correspond to the points A\nand B in this figure. The respective delay \u03c4 between the time of a minimum of\nf0 F 2 and of the function S(t) is close to 4 min in this case.\nThe data from the station Chilton (RAL) and from GPS station HERS nearest\nto it are compared in the next Section.\n\n4\n\nThe process of GPS\u2013network data and results\nof analysis of ionospheric effect by total solar\neclipse of August 11, 1999\n\nWe now give a brief account of the sequence of procedures used in processing\nthe GPS data. Input data are represented by series of \"oblique\" values of TEC\nI(t), as well as by the corresponding series of elevations \u03b8(t) measured from the\nground, and azimuths \u03b1(t) of the line of sight to the satellite measured clockwise\nfrom the northward direction. These parameters are calculated by our developed\nCONVTEC program by converting the GPS-standard RINEX-files from the INTERNET. Series of elevations \u03b8(t) and azimuths \u03b1(t) of the line of sight to the\nsatellite are used to determine the location of subionospheric points. In the case\nunder consideration, all results were obtained for larger than 45\u25e6 elevations \u03b8(t).\nFig. 4c presents the experimental geometry in the area of ionospheric station\nChilton (RAL) - \u22c6, and GPS station HERS (\u2022). Heavy dots \u2022 show the centre\nline of eclipse at ground level, and smaller dots correspond to its southern and\nnorthern boundaries. The symbol \u2217 shows the position of the subionospheric\npoint at the time of a maximum response of TEC (see below).\nVarious methods for reconstructing the absolute value of TEC are currently\nunder development using measurements of both phase and group delays; however,\n6\n\n\feffective algorithms for an accurate solution of this problem are still unavailable\nfor the different types of two-frequency receivers and operating modes of the GPS\nsystem. In this connection, for purposes of this paper, we limit our attention to\nconsidering only those TEC variations which were obtained from phase delay\nmeasurements by formula (Afraimovich et al., 1998):\nIp =\n\n1\nf12 f22\n[(L1 \u03bb1 \u2212 L2 \u03bb2 ) + const + nL]\n40.308 f12 \u2212 f22\n\n(1)\n\nwhere L1 \u03bb1 and L2 \u03bb2 are additional paths of the radio signal caused by the\nphase delay in the ionosphere, (m); L1 and L2 represent the number of phase\nrotations at the frequencies f1 and f2 ; \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 stand for the corresponding\nwavelengths, (m); const is the unknown initial phase ambiguity, (m); and nL are\nerrors in determining the phase path, (m).\nFor an approximate specification of the TEC constant component I0 at time\nintervals of 2 hours, we made use of the INTERNET data on corresponding global\nmaps of the absolute vertical value of TEC in the IONEX format (Mannucci,\n1998) - see also Fig. 2b. To normalize the response amplitude we converted the\n\"oblique\" TEC to an equivalent \"vertical\" value:\nI(t) = Ip (t)sin(\u03b8(t))\n\n(2)\n\nAlthough, because of a strong horizontal TEC gradient and without regard\nfor the spericity of the problem, this procedure gives a very rough result, but this\nresult is quite acceptable because all our results were obtained for larger than 45\u25e6\nelevations \u03b8(t).\nWith the purpose of eliminating variations of the regular ionosphere, as well as\ntrends introduced by the satellite's motion, we employ the procedure of eliminating the trend by preliminarily smoothing the initial series with the time window\nin the range from 40 to 100 min which is fitted for each TEC sampling. Such a\nprocedure is also required for a clearer identification of the ionospheric response\nof eclipse which is characterized by a relatively small amplitude (see below) under the presence of space-time TEC variations that are not associated with the\neclipse.\nFor the purposes of illustration of the data processing procedure Fig. 5\npresents the filtered TEC variations dI(t) for August 11 (thick line), and for\nthe background days of August 10 and 12, 1999 (thin lines) for station HERS\nfor satellite N14 (PRN 14) - c), as well as for stations ZIMM (PRN 1) - b) and\nWTZT (PRN 14) - a), which are separated from station HERS, respectively, by\n7\u25e6 and 13\u25e6 in longitude eastward. Figures correspond to GPS satellite numbers.\nThe onset time of the totality phase of eclipse at 300 km altitude for the corresponding subionospheric points is shown by vertical solid lines. As is evident\nfrom the figure, responses to the eclipse at these stations are very similar in both\nform and amplitude, but the response delay increases with the longitude. dI(t)\n7\n\n\f\u2013 variations for the background days of August 10 and 12, 1999 for different stations differ substantially not only from the TEC response to eclipse but also from\none another.\nFig. 4b presents the filtered variations of TEC dI(t) for station HERS for\nPRN 14 during August 11, 1999 (thick line). This panel plots also the geometrical function of eclipse at 300 km altitude, S(t), that is calculated for the\nsubionospheric point of PRN 14. A minimum value of S(t) corresponds to the\npoint A in the figure.\nAs is apparent from this figure, the form of the filtered variations is similar\nto a triangle whose vertex (point B) corresponds to the time at which the TEC\nattains its minimum value. The value of dImin itself can serve as an estimate\nof the amplitude of TEC response to eclipse, and the time interval between the\ntimes of intersection of the line dI=0 (points C and D) can serve as an estimate of\nthe duration of the response \u2206T . The corresponding delay \u03c4 between the times\nof the minimum of dImin and of the function S(t) in this case was found to be 4\nmin, which coincides with the estimate of \u03c4 for ionospheric station Chilton (see\nSection 3). The response amplitude in this case was close to 0.18 TECU, and\nthe response duration was 46 min.\nSuch dI(t) \u2013 variations are characteristic for all GPS stations and satellite\nnumbers 01 and 14 listed in Table 1. The choice of the same satellites, PRN 01\nand PRN 14, for the entire selected set of GPS stations was dictated by the fact\nfor these satellites a maximum value of the elevation \u03b8 of the line of sight to the\nsatellite exceeded 45\u25e6 for the time interval 10:00-12:30 UT, which reduced to a\nminimum the possible error of conversion to the \"vertical\" value of TEC as a\nconsequence of the sphericity.\nThe first line of Table 2 presents the results of a statistical processing for the\nentire set of GPS stations listed in Table 1. The second line includes only those\nstations whichlie in the immediate vicinity of the eclipse path, within \u00b1 5\u25e6 with\nrespect to the centre line (near zone). In Table 2, the values before the bar are\nmean values, and those after the bar correspond to the standard deviation. The\nmean value of \u03c4 for the entire set of stations is 16 min, while for the stations\nin the near zone this value is 7 min. The mean value of the amplitude A=0.3\nTECU for all stations and A=0.1 TECU for the near zone. The width of the\nTEC trough for the far and near zones \u2206T = 60 min, on average.\nFig. 6 presents a longitudinal dependence of the time position tmin of minima\nof the curves dI(t) for subionospheric points lying in the immediate vicinity of\nthe eclipse band (satellites 1 and 14) - heavy dots. Dark symbols \u25b3 designate\nthe times of totality phases of the geometrical function of eclipse versus longitude\nwhich are calculated for the subionospheric points. Shaded symbols \u22c4 correspond\nto delay times between maximum of the geometrical function of eclipse and a\nminimum in TEC.\nIt was found that the delay \u03c4 increases gradually from 4 min at the Greenwich\nlongitude (10:23 UT, LT) to 16 min at the longitude of 16\u25e6 (12:09 LT).\n8\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nOur results are in good agreement with earlier measurements and theoretical\nestimates (see a review of the data in the Introduction). The key feature of our\ndata is a higher reliability of determining the main parameters of the response to\neclipse which is due to high space-time resolution and to the increased sensitivity\nof detection of ionospheric disturbances inherent in the GPS-array method which\nwe are using.\nAlso, due regard must be had to the fact that the distinctive property of\nthe eclipse under consideration was a relatively small response amplitude, which\nrequired special filtering of the TEC series (see preceding Section). The reason is that, unlike a number of eclipses for which more-or-less reliable data were\nobtained, this eclipse occurred in the summer season characterized by only moderate differences of the daytime and night-time ionization. Furthermore, in this\nsituation the time variation of f0 F 2 and vertical TEC near noon usually shows a\nminimum which, in essence, masks the eclipse effect (see also Fig. 2b). It is also\nvital to note that the time constant of a decrease in ionization in the F2 maximum exceeds substantially the duration of the totality phase of eclipse, which\nleads also to a decrease in response amplitude.\nThe local time-dependence of \u03c4 that is revealed in this paper is in agreement\nwith theoretical estimates reported in (Stubbe, 1970). The value of \u03c4 for foF2,\napproaching 6 min, corresponded to 13:40 LT. Using modeling methods (Ivelskaya\net al., 1977) showed that the variations of the delay time \u03c4 of minimum local\nelectron density Ne (t) with respect to a minimum of the ion production function\nare as follows: \u03c4 = 1-2 min at 150 km altitude, \u03c4 = 3 min at 200 km, \u03c4 = 20\nmin at 300 km, and \u03c4 = 45 min above 600 km. In this paper \u03c4 is estimated,\nrespectively, at about 3 min for 200 km altitude and 20 min for 300 km altitude\nfor 12 LT.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to K. S. Palamartchouk, A.
