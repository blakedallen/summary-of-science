The new\nheteostructures can be obtained by applying strain to a single material in a periodic or aperiodic\nway. The conversion of an indirect gap into an optical active direct or quasi-direct gap problem\nhas also been investigated together with the role of zone folding in this phenomenon.\nThe advent of the nanotechnology and the possibility to manipulate at the atomic level, added to the\ncontinuous improvements of the growth techniques made it possible to obtain structures and systems\nwhich did not exist previously (such as quantum dots, quantum wires, photonic bandgap materials, nanotubes, ultrathin quantum well superlattices, etc.). A great effort is still devoted to the research on new and\noriginal structures.\nThe strain \u2013confinement interplay and related effects are attracting a great deal of attention for their\ntechnological and theoretical implications [1, 2, 3]. Both quantum wire (1D) and dot (0D) like confinement can be induced by strain [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Obviously, when a strain \u03c7 is applied to a semiconductor,\nthe conduction (CB) and valence bands (VB) of both light holes (LH) and heavy holes (HH) are differently shifted in the vicinity of the Brillouin zone centre. The subbands are lowered for one type of holes\nand lifted for the other. It can be expected that if the strain is applied to selected regions of the same\nmaterial, we could obtain an original structure of wells and barriers for holes (Fig. 1) giving simultaneously rise to the two types I and II superlattices (SL), one for LH and another for HH. These perturbed\nstructures (PS) can be divided in periodic perturbed structures (PPS) and aperiodic perturbed structures\n(APS) according to the way in which the strain is applied. There is no particular restriction on the intensity of \u03c7 which can be applied on the material. We stress that in all what follows, the choice of strain\nstrengths is dictated by reasons of commodity such as the induced potential wells can be sufficient for\nthe apparition of confinement and tunnelling. Also, our chosen materials are semiconductors widely used\nin different studies with well known bulk properties and characteristics.\nThe envelope function method (EFM) based on the 8x8 Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian including \u03c7 [9, 10]\nis an adequate method to study this kind of systems. VB is decoupled from CB and the spin orbit coupling is neglected since it is large enough in all our materials. Thus, the problem reduces to a 4x4 Hamiltonian matrix for VB and a single band equation for CB. Even if more complex versions like the first\nprinciples EFM are existing now [11], the EFM with fitted parameters is widely used in nanostructure\nstudies, being valid when Bloch functions near CB and VB tops are slowly varying at the interfaces and\npotential variations are smooth in the unit cell.\nIn practice, it is by analyzing the nature of the wavevectors that a region can be identified as a well or a\nbarrier. Thus, we implemented a code which determines itself the nature of each region and treats adequately each one. In CB (single band), there are four types of regions (i) the \"tunnelling region\" (TR),\n(ii) the \"confinement region\" (CR), (iii) regions labelled FR where any state is forbidden because the\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\nCorresponding author: e-mail: nsekkal@yahoo.fr and nsekkal@ictp.it\nOn leave from Applied Materials Laboratory, Centre de Recherches (ex CFTE), Universit\u00e9 Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s, 22000, Algeria\nOn leave from Computational Materials Science Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 de Sidi Bel Abb\u00e8s, 22000, Algeria\n\n\f2\n\nNadir Sekkal, V.R.Velasco : Novel strain-induced low dimensional confinement structures.\n\nwhole sample plays the role of a barrier and (iv) regions labelled VR where all states are virtual and the\nwhole sample plays the role of a well. However, in VB (multiband), there are also mixed regions due to\nholes scattering. In particular, there is the case where one kind of holes is tunnelling while the other has a\nvirtual state. Such regions will be denoted VTR. We will also use the label MR for mixed regions which\noccur when in the extreme regions, one hole has extended states while the other has evanescent states.\nWe remind that if we have a CR the presence of confined states is not guaranteed because a secular equation must be obeyed. However, when a region is TR, tunnelling exists but not necessarily a resonant one.\nWe also stress that LH and HH are decoupled only for k // = (k x , k y ) = 0 .\nLet us consider the example of the VB of InAs taking into account the in-plane wave vector, i.e,\nk // = (k x , k y ) \u2260 0 whose effect is important [12]. The Luttinger parameters are taken from Refs [13]. A\nstrain \u03c7 = -70.74 meV was applied along the [001] direction before and after a bulk region of 200 \u00c5\nlying in the [001] direction. Our predictions are confirmed. Five regions are obtained (Fig. 2a). The\nhigher FR is followed by a CR containing four confined subbands which we have all identified with our\nsingle band code at k // = 0 as being HH. The MR appears for higher k // and is followed successively by\na VTR then a VR both containing subbands due only to virtual states and not to resonant tunnelling effect (RTE) which cannot occur in APS since it is analogous to a single well. All VTR/VR states are HH\n(at k // = 0 ) except the one at -140.63 meV which is LH. The physical reasons of these findings can be\nunderstood from Fig. 3 where we see clearly how \u03c7 has split the HH-LH degeneracy in the central layer.\nHH is pushed upwards by 35.91 meV while LH is lowered by 105.57 meV so that we obtain a well for\nHH and a barrier for LH. At k // = 0 and for energies 0 < E < 35.91 meV HH is confined while LH is\nforbidden but for -105.57 < E < 0 meV, HH states are virtual while LH is tunnelling and when E < 105.57 meV both HH and LH states are virtual.\nThe investigations on a double APS constituted by InAs/ InAs(P)/ InAs/ InAs(P)/ InAs (P for perturbed)\nwith three central InAs blocks of 200, 50 and 200 \u00c5 respectively and the same previous \u03c7 =-70.74 meV\nlead to results similar to classical HS's: most of the confined VB's are split twofold (Fig. 2b) as if it was\ndue to interferences in a double barrier. In this case also, all levels at k // = 0 were identified HH except\ntwo lying at -140.19 and -74.37 meV, the first one being virtual and the second a resonant tunnelling\nstate. This resonance can be easily understood by analogy with the classical double barriers where RTE\ntakes place. Hence, negative resistance phenomenon (NRP) is expected to occur and this is interesting\nsince it may be obtained with only one bulk material. Our calculated holes transmissivity and reflectivity\n[10] resemble to those observed in classical HS.\nThe results for CB lend strong support to what claimed above. For a GaAs/GaAs(P)/GaAs single APS\nwith a 300 \u00c5 central region subjected to a negative strain of -40 meV, we found three regions (Fig. 4a):\nFR and VR sandwich a CR where three subbands are confined. All three bands are parabolic and have\nthe same effective mass close to the bulk 0.067m0 [13]. When strain was turned to positive, CR was\nreplaced by TR but not in the same limits. In the case of a CB of a double APS of GaAs/ GaAs(P)/GaAs/\nGaAs(P)/ GaAs with three central layers of 50, 300 and 50 \u00c5 respectively with the previous positive\nstrain results were similar to RTE (Fig. 4b). It is clear now that NRP is possible in present PS's. Thus,\ndepending on the sign of strain, we have either CR or TR and since this holds also for holes at k // = 0 ,\nthe above prediction is confirmed: we expect both types I and II simultaneously at k // = 0 .\nThe band discontinuities \u2206ELH ,HH ,c represent the band offsets of PS's and are directly related to the applied strain. At k // = 0 the width of the energetic interval of CR of CB is equal to the strain magnitude\n(Fig. 4) and there are two different shifts for LH and HH which are both linked by the simple following\n\uf8eb \u2212 2.a.(S11 + 2 S12 ) \uf8f6\nformula to \u03c7: \u2206E LH ( HH ) = \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\u00b1 1\uf8f7\uf8f7.\u03c7 , where Sij are the compliance constants, a and b repre\uf8ed 3.b.(S11 \u2212 S12 )\n\uf8f8\nsent the hydrostatic and the shear deformation potentials respectively, the plus or minus sign depends\nwhether it is an LH or an HH. Far from k // = 0 , the VB energetic interval varies while those of CB are\n\n\fSubmitted to : Review Title. (2008)\n3\n\nconstant but shifted. These simple relations make the present PS's good candidates to study this fundamental problem. On the other hand, if a small strain is applied, a pure zone folding (PZF) may occur. The\nlatter can transform an indirect gap into a direct one by carrying the bottom of CB just above the top of\nVB as already proposed by Gnutzmann and Clausecker [14] who opted for Si/SiGe SL's. We have investigated this possibility in the PS(m, n) which gives the opportunity to check on the PZF effect since\nunlike the SiGe systems, the same atoms are found on either side of the interfaces, m and n being the\nnumbers of unperturbed and perturbed monolayers.\nSince \u2206V is small, the PS eigensystem is obtained by a simple ZF which determines a unique set of\nequivalent bulk wavevectors k to each wavevector KPS of the PS. The general principle being that the\nbulk k 's in which are located the VB top and the CB bottom belong to the same equivalent set to a given\nKPS . Thus, some arithmetic rules on m and n must be obeyed. The latter can lead to complicated situations. Fortunately, these arithmetic rules are not mandatory to obtain a quasi-direct gap.\nFor these investigations, we have employed the local density approximation (LDA) based full potential\nlinear muffin tin orbital method in the atomic sphere [15] as implemented in lmtART code [16]. Notice\nthat a 1D (small) strain changes the atomic distances and leads to large supercells. Then, as an approximation, we considered small rigid atomic shifts. This is justified since both are expected to produce just\nan almost PZF. PZF lowers drastically the \u0393-\u0393 indirect gap which becomes closer to the direct gap. The\ndifference being just 21 meV for PPS(5,5) (Fig. 5a) and the small atomic shift decreases it more by 3\nmeV (Fig.5b). Even if underestimated by LDA, these \u0393-\u0393 gaps are promising. Notice that the high symmetry directions do not have same lengths and they vary with m, n but for reasons of comparison, the\nvariations were plotted versus the indexes of k 's instead of k 's themselves. Gaps variations with m, n\nare not uniform because in each case the bulk equivalent point set is different. However, for large m + n,\nthese sets involve closer bulk wavevectors and become almost comparable so that the study in terms of m\n+ n is justified. We remark a competition between two PPS points, one lying in M-\u0393 and the other in \u0393Z. The latter is in general the lower. We remark from Fig. 5[b+c] that the \u0393-\u0393 quasi-direct gap in a\nSi(4)/SiGe(4) SL is comparable to that of PS(4,4) but smaller.\nTo explain this evolution, we have checked that at the contrary of bulk Si for which the 3s orbital is almost absent from the CB bottom at \u0393, the latter contribute significantly in the PPS's. The presence of a\nquasi-direct gap and of a significant contribution of the 3s orbital to the bottom of CB at makes the optical activity a reachable goal in principle. We checked also that the contributions in Si(4)/SiGe(4) are\nsimilar to those of PS(4,4) and that they were mostly due to Si. Thus, we infer that ZF has a greater influence on the optoelectronic properties of Si(4)/SiGe(4) than the incorporation of Ge atoms. This is to\nshed light on the controversial problem of whether dislocations or ZF is the responsible [17].\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a new kind of low dimensional systems which can be obtained from a\nsingle material. We checked the indirect to optical active direct or pseudo direct gap conversion problem\nand that our structures may have confinement, tunnelling and negative resistance comparable to the usual\nHS's and SL's. The fabrication of PPS's may not be easy because of the condition of localisation of the\nperturbation in periodical and nanometric distances. Fortunately this condition is not required for APS's\nand it is reasonable to think possible their fabrication. Topics like RTE, VB mixing and band offsets may\nbe interesting in PS's. The spatial separation (type I or II) may affect the excitonic effects. In summary,\nwith such structures, new applications are expected. This work shows also that in the absence of dislocations, ZF may be responsible of the optical activity in SiGe systems and similar.\nAcknowledgements One of the authors, N.S thanks the CSIC of Madrid (Spain), the CTAPS of Irbid (Jordan) and\nthe ICTP of Trieste (Italy) for their hospitality in 2003, 2005 and 2007/2008.
