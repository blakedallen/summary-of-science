The richness of the physics\naround the MIT stems from the fact that it is a quantum phase transition where disorder and Coulomb interactions coexist and compete in the determination of the\nground state. In the case of the n-doped semiconductors,\nthe MIT appears at doping densities where the Fermi\nlevel is in the impurity band [3]. This observation allows a description taking into account only the electronic\nstates built from the hydrogenic ground state of the doping impurities. For densities slightly larger than the\ncritical one (in the metallic side of the transition) noninteracting models, like the Matsubara-Toyozawa (MT)\n[4] are applicable. Furthermore, the previous description\nin terms of impurity sites is often traded by the Anderson model of a tight-binding lattice with on-site or hopping disorder. Large amounts of numerical work have\nbeen devoted to the Anderson model [5] and the critical exponents obtained fit reasonably well those of the\nexperimental measurements [6].\nThe recently developed field of spintronics is contributing to put the MIT again into the focus of the condensed\nmatter community. A key concept for possible applications of spintronics is the spin relaxation time, that is, the\ntypical time in which the electron spin loses its initially\nprepared direction. Interestingly, the maximum spin relaxation times in n-doped semiconductors have been observed for impurity densities close to that of the MIT\n[7\u201311]. This intriguing physics is not completely understood at present, and various mechanisms of spin relaxation have been thought to be active at the MIT region\n[12\u201315]. At the level of models, the generalization of the\nAnderson model in order to include some spin-orbit coupling has been provided by Ando [16]. While this model\nis very useful to study the progressive breaking of the\n\nspin symmetry [17], its connection with experimentally\nrelevant systems requires the estimation of coupling parameters which are not obtainable from first principles.\nThis situation has lead us to reconsider the MT model of\nimpurity sites randomly placed in order to incorporate in\nit the spin-orbit interaction. The various spin-orbit couplings (intrinsic and extrinsic) can be included and lead\nto effective Hamiltonians which depend on fundamental\nmaterial constants, rather than on adjustable parameters.\nIn this paper we first consider the MT model in order to\ncharacterize the regions of extended and localized states,\nanalyzing the limitations of the model and the conditions\nof applicability. We then include one of the sources of\nspin-orbit coupling, the Rashba interaction [15] to study\nhow the previous picture evolves under increasing values of the coupling strength. This work is a necessary\nstep towards the understanding of spin dynamics in the\ngeneralized models that will allow us to extract the spin\nrelaxation times close to the MIT.\nWe start by considering the MT Hamiltonian [4]\nX\n\u2020\nH0 =\nt\u03c3\u03c3\n(1)\nm\u2032 m cm\u2032 \u03c3 cm\u03c3 ,\nm6=m\u2032 ,\u03c3\n\nwhere c\u2020m\u2032 \u03c3 (cm\u03c3 ) represents the creation (annihilation)\noperator for the ground state of the impurity at site m\u2032\n(m) with spin projection \u03c3 in the z-direction. The spin\ndegree of freedom is irrelevant for the MT model, but it\nwill become crucial later. The hopping matrix element is\nt\u03c3\u03c3\nm\u2032 m = h\u03c6m\u2032 |Vm\u2032 |\u03c6m i\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nRm\u2032 m\nRm\u2032 m\nexp \u2212\n,\n= \u2212V0 1 +\na\na\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c6p (r) = \u03c6(|r \u2212 Rp |), with \u03c6(r) = 1/(\u03c0a3 )1/2 \u00d7\nexp (\u2212r/a), and a is the effective Bohr radius. The\nCoulombic potential produced by the impurity placed at\nRp is Vp (r) = \u2212V0 (a/|r \u2212 Rp |), where V0 = e2 /\u03b5a and \u03b5\n\n\f2\n\n10\n\n0.2\n\n5\n\n0.1\n(ni a3 )1/3 = 0.4\n\nIPR/N\n\n0\n\n0\n5\n\n0.1\n\n2.5\n(ni a3 )1/3 = 0.33\n\n0\n0.1\n\nDOS [V0\u22121 ]\n\nstands for the static dielectric constant of the semiconductor.\nIn order to characterize the electronic eigenstates in the\nimpurity band from the point of view of their extended\nor localized nature, we solve numerically the eigenvalue\nproblem defined by the Hamiltonian (1) for given configurations in which N impurities are randomly placed in a\nthree-dimensional volume. Performing the impurity average we obtain (Fig. 1) the density of states (DOS) and\nthe inverse participation ratio (IPR) for three densities\non the metallic side of the transition. The impurity band\ndevelops around the E = 0 level of the isolated impurity in an asymmetric fashion: the DOS exhibits a long\nlow-energy tail while the high-energy part is bounded\nby E = 1 (in units of V0 ). We verify that the width\nof the impurity band increases with the doping density.\nThe highest-energy states correspond to electronic wave\nfunctions localized on small clusters of impurities. This\nclustering is known to happen in realistic systems due to\nthe lack of hard-core repulsion between impurities on the\nscale of a [15, 18].\nBefore continuing with the analysis of the numerical\nresults obtained from the MT model, we discuss some\ntechnical features of the model and the difficulties that\nwe face in trying to improve upon it. Firstly, we notice\nthat the chosen basis set is not orthogonal. In principle, we can deal with this issue by writing a generalized\neigenvalue problem which includes the matrix of orbital\noverlaps [19, 20]. This procedure results in unphysical\nhigh-energy states (with E \u226b 1) that necessitate the\ninclusion of hydrogenic states beyond the 1s orbital in\norder to be described properly. However, care must be\ntaken since enlarging the basis set leads to the problem of\novercompleteness. Fortunately, for the properties we are\ninterested in, the effects arising from non-orthogonality\nare known to be small for moderate doping densities, and\nthat is why we will not consider them in the numerical\nwork, thus staying within the original MT model. Finally, another drawback of the MT model is that the\nhigh-energy edge of the impurity band overlaps with the\nconductance band, which starts at V0 /2 (the effective Rydberg) and is not included in the MT description. As seen\nin Fig. 1 the DOS beyond V0 /2 is always very small, and\ntherefore we can ignore the effects that the hybridization\nof the bands would yield in a more complete model.\nThe IPR measures the degree of extension of the electronic wave function. Large values of the IPR denote in\ngeneral extended states while low values are associated\nwith localized states. In particular, an homogeneously\ndistributed wave function would have an IPR/N = 1,\nwhile a localized state would exhibit a vanishing IPR/N\nupon increasing values of N . In our study of spin relaxation it is important to know whether the states near the\nFermi energy are in the region of extended or localized\nstates.\nThe determination of the mobility edges from the size\n\n0\n4\n2\n\n(ni a3 )1/3 = 0.29\n0\n\n0\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nE[V0 ]\n\nFIG. 1. Density of states (DOS, thick line and right scale) and\ninverse participation ratio (IPR, left scale) for three different\ndensities on the metallic side of the metal-insulator transition, obtained through impurity averaging in the MatsubaraToyozawa model. The solid, dashed and dotted curves of\nIPR/N are for N = 2744, 4096 and 5832, respectively, and\nthe vertical lines indicate the Fermi energy.\n\nscaling of Fig. 1 is not straightforward. This difficulty\narises from the heavily structured DOS of the MT model.\nAt low energy the small values of the DOS translates into\na poor statistics for feasible sizes. In the high-energy part\nof the impurity band the separation between the curves\ncorresponding to different values of N is masked by the\nsmall values of the IPR/N .\nFor the highest density (top panel) the IPR/N exhibits\na relatively flat region at intermediate energies, which\nis approximately independent of N for the two largest\nsystem sizes. The lower mobility edge can be located\nroughly at E \u223c 3.5, where the latter curves separate.\nFor lower impurity densities (lower panels) the previous\nanalysis becomes increasingly demanding in terms of system sizes. We see that the flat region of IPR/N shrinks\nfrom which we can conclude that the lower mobility edge\nis shifting towards higher values of E.\nThe study of spin relaxation in doped semiconductors\nwith densities close to the that of the MIT calls for a\ngeneralization of the previously discussed MT model that\nincorporate spin-orbit coupling. Such an extension was\ndone in Ref. [15], where a spin-flip term\nH1 =\n\nX\n\n\u2020\n\u03c3\u03c3\ntm\n\u2032m c \u2032\nm \u03c3 cm\u03c3\n\n(3)\n\nm6=m\u2032 ,\u03c3\n\nwas added to H0 (\u03c3 = \u2212\u03c3).\n\nSimilarly to the spin-\n\n\f3\nconserving case, we have\nX\nh\u03c8\u0303m\u2032 \u03c3 |Vp |\u03c8\u0303m\u03c3 i.\nt\u03c3\u03c3\nm\u2032 m =\n\n1\n\nRr = 1\n10\n\n(4)\n\n10\u22126\n\np6=m\n\n10\u22126\n\n\u2193\n\n10\u22123\n1\n\nRr = 100\n\n10\u22122\n10\n\n\u2191\n\n\u22123\n\nLDOS\n\nThe wave function \u03c8\u0303m\u03c3 is a spin-mixed conduction-band\nstate with an envelope part \u03c6m (r) and a lattice-periodic\npart which has a small spin admixture. In Ref. [15], the\nexpression of the matrix elements of Eq. (4) within an\n8-band Kane model were obtained. Since the two-center\nintegrals p = m, m\u2032 were shown to vanish, the spin-flip\nhopping amplitude is given by the sum of three-center integrals with p 6= m, m\u2032 . The three-center integrals cannot\nbe analytically solved in general. In Ref. [15] we provided\napproximate analytical expressions of t\u03c3\u03c3\nm\u2032 m which allowed\nus to estimate the spin relaxation times. On the other\nhand, in this work we take the route of the numerical\nevaluation of the three-center integrals.\nSpin-orbit coupling is known to favor the delocalization of disordered systems in two dimensions. In what\nfollows we repeat the previous analysis, done for the MT\nmodel, for the spin-orbit generalized model in this case,\nfor increasing values of the spin-orbit coupling Rr (the\nsubindex r stands for Rashba).\nFor the realistic values of the spin-orbit coupling\nstrength (Rr = 1) considered in Ref. [15], the spinadmixture perturbation energies are, even for largest system sizes that we can treat numerically, orders of magnitude smaller than the MT level spacing. In Fig. 2 we\nshow the spectral decomposition of a MT eigenstate with\n\u03c3 = 1 in the basis of spin-admixed eigenstates of H0 +H1 .\nOnly for enhanced values of Rr do we obtain significant\nprojections into the two spin-admixed subspaces.\nThe study of larger values of Rr then appears not only\nas a useful tool for analyzing the progressive inclusion of\nspin-orbit effects, but also as a need for numerical simulations of the spin dynamics.\nIn Fig. 3 we present the DOS and IPR/N of the extended model for the three densities previously treated\nand various values of the spin-orbit coupling strength Rr .\nThe DOS does not noticeably change with Rr , and that\nis why we only present the Rr = 1 case. The spin-orbit\ncoupling results in the increase of the IPR/N as a function of Rr in the region of extended states. This effect\nis more prominent for the larger density. The low-energy\nsector that has localized states in the MT model exhibits\nIPR/N curves approximately independent of N , which is\na signature of the delocalization tendency.\nIn Fig. 4 we perform a finite-size scaling of the IPR/N\nfor a given density above the MIT critical density and\none value of the spin-orbit coupling enhancement factor,\nRr = 50.\nIn conclusion, we revisited the problem of the characterization of the eigenstates of the Matsubara-Toyozawa\nmodel from the point of view of their localization, and\nperformed a similar analysis in an extended model proposed recently which includes the structural inversion\n\n\u2191\n\n\u22123\n\n10\u22123\n10\u22122\n\n\u2193\n\n1\n10\u22121\n\nRr = 500\n\n\u2191\n\n10\u22122\n\n10\u22122\n\u2193\n\n10\u22121\n\u22121\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nE[V0 ]\n\nFIG. 2.

We found that\nwhile the density of states is not considerably modified\nby the spin-orbit interaction, the nature of the states is\nnoticeably affected by it showing a tendency to the delocalization.\nWe acknowledge the financial support of the Coll\u00e8ge\nDoctoral Europ\u00e9en of the Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg and\nof UBACYT through grant number X495.\n\n[1] Conduction in non-crystalline materials, by Sir Nevill\nMott (Oxford Science Publications, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1987).\n[2] The Mott Metal Insulator Transition: Models and Methods, by Forian Gebhard (Springer, Berlin, 2010).\n\n\f4\n0.4\n\n20\n0.2\n\n10\n\n15\nIPR/N\n\n(ni a3 )1/3 = 0.4\n\n0.1\n0\n\n0\n10\n\n0.1\n\n5\n\n(ni a3 )1/3 = 0.33\n\n0\n\nDOS [V0\u22121 ]\n\n0.2\n\n0\n7.5\n\n0.1\n\n5\n2.5\n\n(ni a3 )1/3 = 0.29\n0\n\n0\n\u22128\n\n\u22126\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22122\n\n0\n\nE[V0 ]\n\nFIG. 3.
