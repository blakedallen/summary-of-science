INTRODUCTION\n\nM 87 is one of the nearest active galaxies (16.7 Mpc;\nJord\u00e1n et al. 2005) which exhibits relativistic outflows. The\nmass of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) is measured to be 3.2 \u00d7109 M\u2299 from HST observations of the ionized gas disk (e.g., Macchetto et al. 1997). Recent analyses\nof the stellar kinematics suggest a larger mass of 6.6 \u00d7 109\nM\u2299 (Gebhardt et al. 2011). This larger mass gives an apparent size \u223c 8 \u03bcas for the Schwarzschild radius rs . This galaxy\ntherefore provides a unique opportunity to study the relativistic outflow with the highest physical resolution in units of rs .\nBased on the VLA/VLBI observations during the past three\ndecades, the structure of the M87 jet has been extensively\nexamined. Junor et al. (1999) found a smooth variation of\nthe jet opening angle from 60\u25e6 at \u223c 0.03 pc to smaller than\n10\u25e6 over \u223c 10 pc, indicating that the jet is being collimated\nby the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) process (Meier et al.\n2001). One of the most interesting features in the M87 jet\nis the bright knot G, lying about 1\u2032\u2032 (\u223c 78 pc) from the core in\nthe VLA maps (Owen et al. 1989). That region has been resolved by the HST into a structured complex known as \"HST1\" (Biretta et al. 1999). It is located around 0.8 - 1.0\u2032\u2032 (or\n62 \u2212 78 pc) from the core. It consists of bright knots, whose\n(apparent) proper motions are superluminal with a range of\n4c \u2212 6c (Biretta et al. 1999). A similar velocity pattern has\nbeen observed at radio frequencies using the VLBA. The component of HST-1 which is furthest upstream (i.e., HST-1d), is\nstationary to within the errors (< 0.25c), and has been identified as the origin of the superluminal ejections (Cheung et al.\n2007). The structure of the jet downstream of HST-1 (1 \u2212 18\u2032\u2032\nor 0.1 \u2212 1.5 kpc) can be characterized by a conical shape\nwith an opening angle of \u223c 6\u25e6 (Owen et al. 1989). HST1 is also a remarkable site for large flaring activity across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum from radio through optical to X-ray\nbands (Madrid 2009; Harris et al. 2009). Chandra observations show that the flaring event started in 2000, and its brightness eventually increased more than 50 times. Peak brightness\noccurred in 2005 and an adiabatic compression has been suggested as a cause of the flare (Harris et al. 2006). It is thought\n\nto be one possible sites for TeV \u03b3-ray emission (Harris et al.\n2009). Note that all distances are in projection throughout this\nsection.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTIONS\n2.1. EVN data\nWe conducted the EVN observations towards M 87 on\n7 March 2009 at a wavelength of 18 cm with Cambridge\n(UK), Effelsberg (Germany), Jodrell Bank (UK), Knockin\n(UK), Medicina (Italy), Noto (Italy), Onsala (Sweden), Torun\n(Poland), and Westerbork (Netherlands) stations. Both left\nand right circular polarization data were recorded at each telescope using 8 channels of 8 MHz bandwidth and 2 bit sampling. The data were correlated at the JIVE correlator.\nA priori amplitude calibration for each station was derived\nfrom a measurement of the system temperatures during each\nrun and the antenna gain. Fringe fitting was performed using AIPS. After delay and rate solutions were determined,\nthe data were averaged over 12 seconds in each IF and selfcalibrated using Difmap.\n2.2. MERLIN data\n\nWe conducted the MERLIN observations on 9 March 2007\nat a wavelength of 18 cm with Defford, Cambridge, Knockin,\nDarnhall, Jodrell Bank and Tabley stations. Both left and\nright circular polarization data were transferred from each\ntelescope with 15 MHz bandwidth.\nInitially, the data were pipelined, and a channel-by-channel\nflux scale derived from 3C 286 observation was applied. After\nthis a priori amplitude calibration, we self-calibrated the data\nusing Difmap.\n2.3. VLBA data\n\nWe also analyzed archival VLBA data of the M 87 jet\n(BK073). Those observations were carried out on 22 January\n2000 at 15 GHz with all ten stations of the VLBA and one station of the VLA. 4 IFs, each with an 8-MHz bandwidth, were\nrecorded at each telescope. Data reduction was conducted in\n\n\f2\n\nAsada & Nakamura\n\nF IG . 1.- (a) MERLIN image of M 87. Contours are plotted at -1, 1, 2, ...,\n1024 \u00d7 3.64 mJy beam\u22121 , which is three-times the residual r.m.s. noise. The\nimage is restored with a circular beam of 25 arcsec to emphasize the extended\nstructure. (b) EVN image of M 87. Contours are plotted at -1, 1, 2, ..., 1024\n\u00d7 1.37 mJy beam\u22121 , which is three-times the residual r.m.s. noise. The\nsynthesized beam is 17.8 mas \u00d7 13.1 mas with the major axis at a position\nangle of 76.1\u25e6 . (c) VLBA image of M 87. Contours are plotted at -1, 1, 2, ...,\n1024 \u00d7 0.45 mJy beam\u22121 , which is three-times the residual r.m.s. noise. The\nsynthesized beam is 1.22 mas \u00d7 0.59 mas with the major axis at a position\nangle of -3.99\u25e6 .\n\nthe same manner as for the EVN observations. We reproduced an M 87 image, which is consistent with that published\nin Kovalev et al. (2007).\n3. RESULTS\n\nWe show the images from EVN, MERLIN and VLBA observations in Fig. 1. Image qualities are summarized in table\n1. The bright core at the eastern edge of the jet and continuous jet emission are detected in all images. We define the\ncore with a Gaussian model which was fitted to the innermost\nbright region in all the images. The isolated component at the\ndistance of 900 mas from the core in the EVN image is the\nHST-1 knot. It corresponds to the first bright component to\nthe west of the core in the MERLIN image. This feature was\nnot detected in the VLBA image at 15 GHz, since that data\n\nwere taken before the HST-1 component underwent its flaring\nevent. One of the most important achievements in our observations is a clear detection of continuous jet emission up to\n500 mas from the core in the EVN image. The continuous jet\nstructure between 160 and 500 mas has been suggested in previous measurements (Reid et al. 1989; Cheung et al. 2007),\nbut here they are robustly detected and resolved with high significance in our EVN observations.\nIn order to illustrate the structure of the M 87 jet, we analyze the jet emission along a position angle of 338\u25e6 and fit the\ncross sections of the jet with one Gaussian or multiple Gaussians for all the images. We define the width of the jet as the\ndeconvolved FWHM for the one-Gaussian fitting case. For\nthe multiple-Gaussian fitting case, we define the distance between the outer edges of the FWHMs as the width of the jet.\nWe note that the jet cross sections can be represented mainly\nby two Gaussians when multiple Gaussians were fitted. This\nis consistent with the edge brightened model suggested by\nprevious observations (Owen et al. 1989; Reid et al. 1989;\nJunor et al. 1999).\nWe show the radius of the jet as a function of the deprojected distance from the core in units of rs in Fig. 2. Note\nthat the radius as defined perpendicular to the jet does not suffer from orientation effects. We assume that the viewing angle\nof the jet is 14\u25e6 based on a beaming analysis (Wang & Zhou\n2009). Hereafter, we use the deprojected distance along the\njet throughout the paper. We note that 1 mas corresponds to\n530 rs in deprojected distance. We measure the radius of the\njet at the innermost region by using the previous VLBA image at 43 GHz by Walker et al. (2008) as well. The jet radius\nincreases downstream, as clearly shown in Fig. 2. We found\nthat the streamlines of the M87 jet can be divided into two\ndifferent regimes: i) a parabolic shape with a = 1.73 \u00b1 0.05\n(z \u221d ra , where r is the radius of the jet emission and z is\nthe axial distance from the core), on scales up to \u223c 2.5 \u00d7\n105 rs , and ii) a conical shape with a = 0.96 \u00b1 0.1 starting\nat around 2.5 \u00d7 105 rs . It is remarkable that the jet propagates with a single power-law streamline over more than three\norders of magnitude in distance. Furthermore, it is notable\nthat the two observed power-law streamlines intersect at 2 \u00d7\n105 rs , which is close to the Bondi radius of 3.8 \u00d7 105 rs\n(\u223c 250 pc1 ) (Allen et al. 2006). Indeed, this is the first observational evidence detecting a transition from parabolic to\nconical streamlines in extragalactic jet systems.\n4. DISCUSSION AND SUMMARY\n4.1. Unconfined Structure: Downstream of HST-1\n\nWe consider a conical streamline (z \u221d ra , a = 1) for supersonic jets. In an adiabatic jet, the internal pressure pjet\ndecreases with axial distance z as z \u22122\u0393 (\u0393: the ratio of specific heats). So, we speculate that the constant expansion of\nthe jet radius and a conical structure downstream of HST1 to knot A in the M87 jet, requires the same axial gradient for the external ISM pressure, pism , as pjet (Owen et al.\n1989). If pism decreases slower than pjet , then pism > pjet at\nsome distance so that a recollimation shock will be triggered\n(Sanders 1983). The self-similar solution of a conical streamline for the magnetized case (with a purely toroidal field component) requires pism \u221d z \u2212b , b = 4 (Zakamska et al. 2008).\nFor a general (non-self-similar) case, b > 2 is allowed in\n1 The original value is replaced by taking into account of the mass difference of SMBH.\n\n\fStructure of the M87 Jet\n\n3\n\nF IG . 2.- Distribution of the radius of the jet as a function of the deprojected distance from the core in units of rs . We used images obtained by previous\nVLBA measurements at 43 GHz (red circles) and at 15 GHz (orange circles), EVN measurements at 1.6 GHz (green circles) and MERLIN measurements at 1.6\nGHz (blue circles). The jet is described by two different shapes. The solid line indicates a parabolic structure with a power law index a of 1.7, while the dashed\nline indicates a conical structure with a of 1.0. HST-1 is located around 5 \u00d7 105 rs . The black area shows the size of minor axis of the event horizon of the\nspinning black hole with maximum spin. The grey area indicates the size of the major axis of the event horizon of the spinning black hole with maximum spin,\nand corresponds to the size of the event horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole. The dotted line indicates the size of the inner stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the\naccretion disk for the Schwarzschild black hole.\n\nanalytical and numerical models (Tchekhovskoy et al. 2008;\nLyubarsky 2009; Komissarov et al. 2009). X-ray observations reveal the ISM properties such as the Bondi radius rB \u223c\n250 pc and the King core radius rc \u2243 1.4 kpc (see, e.g.,\nYoung et al. 2002; Di Matteo et al. 2003; Allen et al. 2006).\nThus, the region of conical streamlines in the M87 jet lies between rB and the marginal radius for the power-law decay\nbeyond rc in the King profile, indicating that the ISM distribution is essentially uniform. We thus rule out that the structure downstream of HST-1 is hydrostatically confined by pism\nin order to conform to a conical streamline.\nIn order to possess a conical streamline without any overcollimation between knots HST-1 and A, the condition pjet &\npism should be maintained. Knots HST-1 to A do appear\nto be over-pressured with respect to the external pressure\n(Owen et al. 1989). However, pjet of the inter-knot regions,\nas estimated by the minimum energy argument for the VLA\ndata (Sparks et al. 1996), appears under-pressured with respect to pism , as estimated by the recent X-ray observations\n(Young et al. 2002; Rafferty et al. 2006). One possibility\nis an underestimation of the magnetic field strength when\nthe toroidal (azimuthal) components are not considered, cf.\n\nOwen et al. (1989). It has been further suggested that the\nmagnetic field energy is at least in equipartition (or even larger\nwith a factor of 1 \u223c 2) with the energy of the radiating ultrarelativistic electrons (Stawarz et al. 2005).\nWe note that over-pressured knots do appear to have trails of\nstationary recollimation shocks in purely hydrodynamic jets.\nFalle & Wilson (1985) performed hydrodynamic simulations\nto apply stationary recollimation shocks to the observed knots\nat VLA scales under the assumption of the shallow ISM gradient (pism \u221d z \u22121 ). Stationary features, however, are in conflict\nwith the observed large proper motions (Biretta et al. 1995,\n1999), while the ISM also does not appear to have such a\ngradient. Therefore, we suggest that the highly magnetized\nnature of the jet may be responsible for the conical part of the\nM87 jet.\n4.2. Confined Structure: Upstream of HST-1\n\nWe next consider a parabolic streamline (1 < a \u2264 2)\nfor supersonic jets. It is shown that the magnetized jet\ncan be parabolic in analytical and numerical models where\nthe ISM pressure is decreasing as pism \u221d z \u2212b , b = 2\n(Tchekhovskoy et al. 2008; Komissarov et al. 2009). A self-\n\n\f4\n\nAsada & Nakamura\n\nsimilar solution, also exists for non-magnetized cases with a\npure parabolic streamline (a = 2) under the same pism dependence with b = 2 (Zakamska et al. 2008). Their solution indicates pjet . pism with pressure increasing near the jet edge.\nSo far, no analytical or numerical solutions, except a = 2,\nhave been derived in the non-magnetized cases. We note that\neven in a hydrodynamic recollimation shock model, the jet\nboundary (\"shocked zone\" at the interface of the jet and the\nISM) is expected to be parabolic. However, the ISM is required to be uniform (pism \u223c const.) (Komissarov & Falle\n1997; Nalewajko & Sikora 2009).\nIn order to have parabolic streamlines, b \u223c 2 is required\nin magnetized jets. It is important to examine the distributions of pism . A recent analytical model for a giant ADAF\n(Narayan & Fabian 2011) shows b \u223c 2.3 from beyond rB\ndown to the SMBH, and it is universally derived for slow\nrotation of the ISM (. 30 % of the Keplerian speed) with\nthe wider range of the \u03b1-viscosity parameter (0.001 - 0.3)\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973). A spherically symmetric accretion with MHD turbulence (Shcherbakov 2008) produces\nb \u223c 2.1 without a strong dependence on the parameters and\nthe equation of state. However, the spatial resolution in current X-ray observations is not high enough to resolve this region.\n4.3. HST-1\n\nThe radius of HST-1 appears to be smaller than the size\nestimated by the two power-law streamlines. The maximam\nmeasured radius of the HST-1 region is 2200 rs \u00b1 300 rs and\nmean value is 1300 rs \u00b1 150 rs , while the expected radii are\n3000 rs \u00b1 400 rs for the parabolic case and 4100 rs \u00b1 200 rs\nfor the conical case, respectively. One possibility is that the\njet is subjected to over-collimation towards HST-1.\nAs is seen in Fig. 2, HST-1 is located downstream of the\nBondi radius (rB ), where the jet changes from parabolic to\nconical shape. This transition is presumably caused by the different profiles of the external pressure (changing from steep\nto shallow gradients): The distribution of the external gas follows the influence of gravity from the central SMBH inside of\nrB , while it can be flattened outside of rB . The field strength\n|B| at HST-1 is 0.5 \u2013 20 mG as estimated by the X-ray variability (Perlman et al. 2003; Harris et al. 2009). Supposing\n|B| \u223c 1 mG for our reference, the magnetic pressure is expected to be about 100 times larger (i.e., over-pressured) than\nthe ISM value pism \u223c 4.3 \u00d7 10\u221210 dyn cm\u22122 (Allen et al.\n2006, ne = 0.17 cm\u22123 and kT = 0.8 KeV).\nAnother interesting objective is understanding the production of the superluminal components (Biretta et al. 1999;\nCheung et al. 2007). The observed motions are modeled\nby the quad relativistic shocks in the MHD helical jet\n(Nakamura et al. 2010). Recent optical polarimetry requires\na coherent helical field to explain the distribution of polarization vectors (perpendicular to the jet) (Perlman et al. 2003)\nand variations of the radio electric vector positional angles as\nwell as the fractional polarization degree (Chen et al. 2011),\nindicating either a helical distortion to the jet or a shock propagating through a helical jet (Perlman et al. 2011).\nAn interpretation for the origin of HST-1 as a hydrodynamic\nrecollimation shock has been proposed by Stawarz et al.\n(2006, hereafter S06) and Bromberg & Levinson (2009,\nhereafter BL09). S06 does not explain the observed gradual\ncollimation, and is inconsistent with our observational result.\nThey assume a freely expanding (i.e., a conical) jet which is\nalready in the particle-dominated regime upstream of HST-1.\n\nS06 suggests a shallow external pressure profile pism \u221d z \u22120.6\ninside some critical radius of 3\u2032\u2032 (\u2248 234 pc), as determined by\na stellar cusp (a break in the stellar surface brightness of the\nM87 host galaxy) (Lauer et al. 1992). BL09 also models the\nrecollimation shock at HST-1 with the same pressure profile.\nIn summary, we propose that a transition from parabolic\nto conical streamlines, occurs via a strong compression, due\nto the change in the slope of the axial profile of pism . This\ncondition can be achieved by an imbalance between pjet and\npism in the radial direction due to the over-collimation. It\nis remarkable that recent General Relativistic MHD simulations (McKinney 2006) reproduce the observed transition\nfrom parabolic (a \u223c 1.7) to conical (a \u223c 1.0) streamlines.\nHowever, the scale of the transition does not match with the\nobservations. We suggest that the properties of MHD jets\nshould be considered in a realistic ISM environment.\n4.4. Towards the Jet Origin: BH or Disk?\n\nRecent VLBA observations indicate the VLBI core at 43\nGHz (core43) is located at 20 rs from the position of the\nSMBH for the viewing angle of 14\u25e6 (Hada et al. 2011). With\nthe VLBA image, the size of the core43 can be measured to\nbe 17 \u00b1 4 rs at the position angle of 68\u25e6 , which is approximately perpendicular to the jet axis. If we assume the core\nis the innermost part of the jet emission, the radius of the jet\nis 9 \u00b1 2 rs . This is in good agreement with the extrapolated\nradius of the jet of 9 \u00b1 2 rs assuming parabolic streamlines\nin the inner region. If this is the case, the jet propagates with\na single power-law streamline over more than four orders of\nmagnitude of distance.\nThe jet opening angle is one of the key parameters in\nthe MHD jet acceleration mechanism. Blandford & Payne\n(1982, hereafter BP82) suggest that the jet is initiated by the\nmagneto-centrifugal force if the jet inclination angle between\nthe penetrating magnetic line of force and accretion disk is\nsmaller than 60\u25e6 , which corresponds to a jet opening angle\nlarger than 60\u25e6 . If we assume that the core43 is the innermost\npart of jet emission, the jet opening angle would be estimated\nto be 46\u25e6 at 20 rs . Therefore, the core43 would be located\ndownstream of the Alfv\u00e9n surface where the magnetic pressure gradient force plays a role. Thus, future sub-mm VLBI\nprojects can access initial acceleration mechanisms by direct\nimaging and measure the deviation from parabolic streamlines\nupstream of the core43 .\nFurthermore, as we show in Fig. 2, the parabolic jet can\nbe extrapolated to the vicinity of the SMBH. At the \"axial\" distance of z = 3.4 rs from the SMBH, it intersects the\ntheoretically-expected, inner stable circular orbit (ISCO) of\nthe accretion disk for a Schwarzschild black hole. If the jet\nradius departs from the extrapolation line well beyond 3.4\nrs , it will indicate that the jet originates in the accretion disk\n(BP82). If the streamline is as extrapolated down to 3.4 rs ,\nthe jet must originate from the accretion disk (BP82) around\na spinning black hole and/or the ergosphere of the spinning\nblack hole (Blandford & Znajek 1977, hereafter BZ77). If\nwe see no departure down to 0.5 rs from the SMBH, it indicates that the jet originates from the ergosphere of the spinning black hole (BZ77). Note that the above discussion for\nprograde spinning black holes, while the upper limit of the\nISCO is 4.5 rs for retrograde spinning black holes. Therefore\ntracing back the ridge line and identifying the ejection point\nof the jet is one of the crucial tests to an evaluation of the\nformation mechanism of the jet (BP82 and/or BZ77). More\nfundamentally, it provides an important method for detection\n\n\fStructure of the M87 Jet\n\n5\n\nTABLE 1\nQ UALITIES OF THE IMAGES\nObservation\nEVN\nMERLIN\nVLBA\n\nSynthesised beam\n[mas]\n\n[degree]\n\nPeak intensity\n[Jy beam\u22121 ]\n\nRMS noise level\n[mJy beam\u22121 ]\n\nDynamic Range\n\n[mas]\n17.8\n25\n1.22\n\n13.1\n25\n0.59\n\n76.1\u25e6\n0\u25e6\n-3.99\u25e6\n\n1.77\n2.00\n0.838\n\n0.47\n1.21\n0.15\n\n3770\n1650\n5590\n\nthe spin of the SMBH2 and evaluation of the general theory of\nrelativity.
