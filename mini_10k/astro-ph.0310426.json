EG Cnc, after the main superoutburst\naccompanied with development of superhumps typical of a WZ Sge-type dwarf nova, exhibited a series\nof six major rebrightenings. During these rebrightenings and the following long fading tail, EG Cnc persistently showed superhumps having a period equal to the superhump period observed during the main\nsuperoutburst. The persistent superhumps had a constant superhump flux with respect to the rebrightening phase. These findings suggest the superhumps observed during the rebrightening stage and the fading\ntail are a \"remnant\" of usual superhumps, and are not newly triggered by rebrightenings. By comparison\nwith the 1977 outburst of this object and outbursts of other WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, we propose an activity sequence of WZ Sge-type superoutbursts, in which the current outburst of EG Cnc is placed between\na single-rebrightening event and distinct outbursts separated by a dip. The post-superoutburst behavior\nof WZ Sge-type dwarf novae can be understood in the presence of considerable amount of remnant matter\nbehind the cooling front in the outer accretion disk, even after the main superoutburst. We consider the\npremature quenching of the hot state due to the weak tidal effect under the extreme mass ratio of the WZ\nSge-type binary is responsible for the origin of the remnant mass.\nKey words: accretion, accretion disks - stars: novae, cataclysmic variables - stars: dwarf novae -\nstars: individual (EG Cancri)\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWZ Sge-type dwarf novae are an unusual subtype\nof SU UMa-type dwarf novae (Bailey 1979; Downes,\nMargon 1981; Patterson et al. 1981; O'Donoghue\net al. 1991; Kato et al. 2001b). WZ Sge-type dwarf\nhave properties common to SU UMa-type dwarf novae\n(Vogt 1980; Warner 1985; Warner 1995) in that they show\nsuperoutbursts and superhumps. The most unusual properties of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are characterized by\nthe extremely low frequency of outbursts (usually once in\nyears to decades), the extremely large outburst amplitude\n(exceeding 6 mag) and long (in some cases reaching \u223c100\nd before the quiescence is reached) duration, and the lack\nor extreme deficiency of normal (short) outbursts, which,\nin ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae, occur more frequently than superoutbursts (cf. Warner 1995).\n\nThe origin of such unique characters has been long\nsought, both from the observational and theoretical sides.\nTwo basic ideas have been historically proposed, just like\na descendant from historical discussions on the mechanism of dwarf nova outbursts. One is the mass-transfer\ninstability model, which assumes the outer atmosphere of\nthe extreme low-mass secondary in WZ Sge-type dwarf\nnovae become unstable to the irradiation from the outbursting accretion disk, thus giving rise to an enhanced\nmass-transfer from the secondary, which leads to a longlasting superoutburst (the best historical example of this\napplication being Patterson et al. 1981).\nThe other is an application of the disk-instability model,\nwhich, with an assumption of very low quiescent viscosity\nof the accretion disk, can produce the main characteristics\nof WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, namely the long outburst intervals and the absence of normal outbursts (Smak 1993;\n\n\f2\n\nT. Kato et al.\n\nOsaki 1995b). The required quiescent viscosity (\u03b1C ) to reproduce such long outburst intervals has been shown to be\nextremely small (\u03b1C < 0.00005: Smak 1993; \u03b1C < 0.003:\nOsaki 1995b). These values of the required quiescent viscosity has usually been considered too small for a disk\nwith a developed magneto-rotational instability Balbus,\nHawley (1991), although this problem is recently becoming more positively resolved by considering a suppression\nof this instability in a cold disk with a low electric conductivity Gammie, Menou (1998).\nThe apparent difficulty with the low quiescent viscosity has historically invoked modifications of the diskinstability model exemplified by the truncated inner disk\nLasota et al. (1995). This model supposed a cold steady\nstate-solution during quiescence, and a slight variation in\nmass-transfer rate was supposed to be the cause of infrequent outbursts. Warner et al. 1996 proposed another\npossibility of the magnetically truncated disk. Although\nthese truncated disks were successful in reproducing one of\nthe characteristics of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae (the long\nrecurrence time), these models with a high \u03b1C (\u223c 0.01)\nhave been shown by Osaki 1998 to meet difficulties in\nreproducing long-lasting superoutbursts. Although there\nhave been attempts (e.g. Buat-M\u00e9nard, Hameury 2002)\nto reproduce long outbursts by considering an enhanced\nmass-transfer during superoutbursts, the resultant light\ncurve is very different from observation. Furthermore,\nthe supposed observational evidence for an enhanced\nmass-transfer is excluded by later careful analysis (Osaki,\nMeyer 2003).\nIn addition to these outburst properties, WZ Sge-type\ndwarf novae are shown to have other properties common\nto all members, but are absent in ordinary SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae. One is the presence of early superhumps1\nduring the earliest stage of superoutbursts of WZ Sge-type\ndwarf novae (cf. Kato 2002). The early superhumps have\na stable period almost identical with the orbital period\n[during the best observed 2001 superoutburst of WZ Sge,\nthe period of the early superhumps was reported to be\nvery slightly shorter than the orbital period (Ishioka et al.\n2002)].\nThis feature was historically first detected and described in WZ Sge itself (Bohusz, Udalski 1979; Patterson\net al. 1981), although the origin of this variation was\nnot properly discussed or identified at this time. The\ncommon existence of early superhumps among WZ Sgetype dwarf novae has been progressively confirmed: AL\nCom (Kato et al. 1996; Howell et al. 1996; Patterson\net al. 1996; Nogami et al. 1997a; Ishioka et al. 2002),\nHV Vir (Kato et al. 2001b; Ishioka et al. 2003), RZ Leo\n(Ishioka et al. 2001), and the main focus of this paper, EG\nCnc (Matsumoto, Schmeer 1996; Matsumoto et al. 1998b).\nThe other is occasional \"dips\" (transient fading episodes\nlasting for one to several days) during the later stage of\nsuperoutburst, which was first clearly described in the\n1978 outburst of WZ Sge (e.g. Ortolani et al. 1980),2\n1\n2\n\nThis feature is also referred to as orbital superhumps (Kato et al.\n1996) or outburst orbital hump (Patterson et al. 1998).\nRichter (1992) was the first to discuss on the systematic ten-\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nand was repeated in the 1995 outburst of AL Com (Kato\net al. 1996; Howell et al. 1996; Patterson et al. 1996;\nNogami et al. 1997a). Nogami et al. (1997a) repoeted that\nthe stage after the dip phenomenon shares the characteristics common to superoutbursts of ordinary SU UMatype dwarf novae: the presence of a likely precursor and\nthe subsequent growth of usual superhumps. From these\nfindings, the 1977-1978 outburst of WZ Sge and the 1995\noutburst of AL Com were interpreted as \"double superoutbursts\" (Nogami et al. 1997a).3\nAn argument naturally rises why such a sequence of superoutburst can be only realized in WZ Sge-type dwarf\nnovae. A naive explanation may be a consequence of\nenhanced-mass transfer, but is rather difficult to reconcile considering the low proper angular momentum of the\n\"fresh\" transferred matter, accumulation of which will\nmore easily produce normal outbursts than a second superoutburst. Osaki (1995b), Howell et al. (1996), and\nKuulkers et al. (1996) instead suggested a possibility of\nthe cooling and heating waves originating before the termination of the entire superoutburst. Nogami et al. 1997a\npresented observational evidence in AL Com that the\nsecond superoutburst was triggered by a short outburst,\nwhich, from the absence of superhumps, was attributed\nto a normal outburst as seen in ordinary SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae. Independent observations during the second (super)outburst are critically needed to confirm the\nuniversality of the claimed observational features, and to\nexplain the unique outburst pattern of WZ Sge-type dwarf\nnovae.\nOn 1996 November 30, an alert (vsnet-alert 599)\nthrough the VSNET alert system (Kato et al. 2003d) notifying a bright outburst of the suspected WZ Sge-type\nstar,4 EG Cnc (Schmeer et al. 1996) announced the opening of a new story.\nEG Cnc was originally discovered by Huruhata (1983)\nfrom his photographic archive on the occasion of an outburst in 1977. Subsequent searches for other photographic\nmaterials between 1977 and 1983, and searches for further outbursts by Huruhata himself and a number of amateur astronomers have yielded a null result until 1995.\nMcNaught (1986) correctly identified the quiescent counterpart on Palomar Sky Survey prints, and suggested from\nits marked blue color and the apparent low frequency of\noutbursts that this object is similar to the dwarf nova WZ\nSge.\nUpon the alert by Schmeer, we started time-resolved\n\n3\n\n4\n\ndency of the existence of \"dips\" in outbursts for stars with infrequent outbursts. This discussion, however, has been considered rather ambiguous mainly from the imaginary interpolation\nof the data, and from the general lack of knowledge of that time\nregarding individual dwarf-nova subtypes.\nThe dwarf nova V2176 Cyg, discovered by Hu et al. (1997),\nprobably showed the same course of double superoutbursts\n(Vanmunster, Sarneczky 1997; Nov\u00e1k et al. 2001). See also\nT.

We discuss mainly on its peculiar late-stage\nphenomenon, particularly focusing on repetitive rebrightenings.\n2.\n\nDate of maximum\u2217 Magnitude\u2020 T (d)\u2021\n50439\n13.3\n***\n50446\n13.4\n7\n50453\n13.3\n7\n50458\n13.2\n5\n50465\n13.3\n7\n50475\n13.2\n10\n\u2217\nJD\u22122400000.\n\u2020\nMaximum visual magnitude.\n\u2021\nTime since the preceding rebrightening.\n\nObservations\n\nThe methods of observation and reduction were the\nsame as in Matsumoto et al. (1998b). The observations at Osaka Kyoiku University were carried out using the 50-cm telescope at the Cassegrain focus (focal\nlength = 6.0m) equipped with an Astromed EEV 88200\nCCD camera (1152 \u00d7 790 pixels) and a V -band filter.\nThe observations at Ouda Station were carried out using the 60-cm telescope at the Cassegrain focus (focal\nlength = 4.8m) equipped with a Thomson TH 7882 CCD\ncamera (576 \u00d7 384 pixels). We used an interference filter\ndesigned to reproduce the Johnson V band. The 2 \u00d7 2\non-chip binning mode was used. The frames obtained at\nOsaka Kyoiku University were reduced using the IRAF.5\nThe frames obtained at Ouda Station were reduced with\na microcomputer-based automatic aperture and PSF photometry packages developed by one of the authors (TK).\nWe used GSC 1948.1452 (V = 12.82) as the local comparison star, whose constancy during the observation was\nconfirmed to 0.01 mag using the check star GSC 1948.1193\n(V = 13.86). Heliocentric correction were applied before\nthe following analysis. Table 1 lists the log of CCD photometry.\n2.2.\n\nCourse of the 1996\u20131997 Outburst\n\nFigure 1 represents the overall course of the outburst from CCD and visual observations reported to the\nVSNET, including the available V -band CCD observations, averaged to one to a few points per night. The\nobject was first detected in outburst on 1996 November\n30.917 UT at mvis \u223c12 (Schmeer et al. 1996). The last\navailable negative observation was done on November\n22.685 UT, giving an upper limit of 13.3 (T. Watanabe,\nprivate communication). The early rise was unfortunately\nnot observed due to the interference by the Moon. The\noutburst thus started some time between November 22\nand 30. The existence of early superhumps (Matsumoto\net al. 1998b), which are known to rapidly decay within\nseveral days of the maximum light of a WZ Sge-type superoutburst, and the recorded maximum brightness (mvis\n= 11.8) close to that of the 1977 outburst, suggest that\nthe detection by Schmeer was made within a few days of\nthe start of the outburst.\nThe main superoutburst lasted until December 15 (HJD\n2450433), followed by a precipitous decline. The object\n5\n\nTable 2. List of rebrightenings.\n\nThe Course of the 1996\u20131997 Outburst\n\n2.1.\n\nIRAF is distributed by the National Optical Astronomy\nObservatories, U.S.A.\n\n3\n\nthen faded close to or below V = 16. On December\n20 (HJD 2450438), the first hint of rebrightening was\nrecorded in the Ouda data. On the next night, the object reached the peak brightness of V = 13.29, and soon\nstarted fading rapidly. This rebrightening was first considered to be of the rather common phenomenon among short\norbital-period SU UMa-type dwarf novae (e.g. V1028\nCyg: Baba et al. 2000, see also Kato et al. 1998), not\nnecessarily confined to WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The\nunique property of EG Cnc, however, emerged after this.\nThe star remained about 3 mag brighter than its quiescence, and again showed a rebrightening 7 days after its\nfirst one. Similar rebrightenings repetitively occurred six\ntimes in total (counting those exceeding V = 14 at maximum), separated by five to eleven days. Table 2 summarizes the observed post-superoutburst rebrightenings.\nAlthough there was a suggestion of two rebrightenings after the 1994 superoutburst of another WZ Sge-type candidate, UZ Boo (Kuulkers et al. 1996),6 , such a large number\nof repetitive brightenings had been never observed in any\ndwarf novae until this outburst of EG Cnc.\nAfter its sixth rebrightening on 1997 January 26, EG\nCnc then entered a stage of slow, steady decline, keeping\nthe rate of slow fading between rebrightenings. This stage\nlasted at least until our last observation on 1997 April 25\n(146 d after Schmeer's detection of the outburst), when\nEG Cnc had a magnitude of V = 18.6, which was still 0.6\nmag above the quiescence (cf. Matsumoto et al. 1998b).\nEG Cnc thus reproduced the long-fading tail of WZ Sge\nobserved in 1978 (cf. Ortolani et al. 1980) and AL Com\nin 1995 (Nogami et al. 1997a), accompanied by numerous\nshort rebrightenings instead of a superoutburst-looking\nsecond outburst in WZ Sge and AL Com. Figure 2 shows\nthe comparison of outburst light curves of three bestobserved WZ Sge-type dwarf novae in the recent years.\n6\n\nOur own examination of the available data, together with those\npresented in Kuulkers et al. (1996), led to a less conclusive result regarding the separate occurrence of rebrightenings in UZ\nBoo. The firm conclusion has been hindered by the insufficient\ndetection threshold, and by the unfavorable visibility condition\njust before the solar conjunction.\n\n\f4\n\nT. Kato et al.\n\nTable 1.

Ishioka et al. in preparation, respectively.\n\nSuperhumps and rebrightenings\nSuperhumps\n\nAs already described in Matsumoto et al. (1998b), doubly humped early superhumps were observed during the\nearliest two nights of our observations. Since the raw light\ncurve was not presented in Matsumoto et al. (1998b), we\npresent the light curve in figure 3. Then \"textbook\" superhumps (often referred to as common superhumps or ordinary superhump when discussing on WZ Sge-type stars)\nemerged (e.g. figure 4).\nFigures 5 and 6 show the comparison of the profiles\nof these two kinds of superhumps between the recent\nthree well-observed WZ Sge-type dwarf novae (the data\nof AL Com from Kato et al. 1996, HV Vir from Kato\net al. 2001b). The periods (0.05877 d and 0.06038 d)\nused in folding the data of EG Cnc are our revised estimates, using the PDM (Phase Dispersion Minimization:\nStellingwerf 1978) technique to the datasets for 1996\nDecember 2\u20133 (the stage showing early superhumps) and\n1996 December 7\u201313 (common superhumps), after subtracting the trend of linear decline in each dataset. The\nnew best periods were determined using a minimum determination algorithm developed by one of the authors (TK).\nThe 1-\u03c3 errors for these periods were determined to be\n0.00017 and 0.00001 d, respectively, using Fernie's application to Lafler-Kinman class of statistics (Fernie 1989).\nStatistical F-tests yielded significance levels of the signals\n87% (N = 261) and >99.9% (N = 805), respectively.\nAs is evident from these figures, all of these three WZ\nSge-type dwarf novae showed doubly peaked early superhumps, sometimes with a rather complex structure (cf.\nKato 2002).\nThe smallness of the amplitude in EG Cnc probably\nsuggests that this early modulation had already started\nto decay at the time of observations, or that this system\nhas a low orbital inclination (cf. Osaki, Meyer 2002). The\nexistence of these early superhumps, whose periods are\n\n\f6\n\nT.

The accuracy of maximum determination\nis typically 0.001 d during the main superoutburst, and\n0.002 d during the rebrightening stage.\nIn order to see whether the observed maximum times\ncan be expressed by a continuous period change of a coherent variation, or we need to introduce a discontinuous\nphase jump (cf. Kato et al. 2003a), we calculated residuals\nto linear fits to the observed times in both cases assuming\nthe superhumps having no phase jump and a 0.5 phase\njump. The latter (0.5 phase jump, or phase reversal) corresponds to the phenomenon what is called late superhumps (Haefner et al. 1979; Vogt 1983; van der Woerd\net al. 1988; Hessman et al. 1992).\nIn the former case, the superhump period was confirmed\nto show a discontinuous change and larger O \u2212 C values\n(figure 11), while the latter case showed a more reasonable,\nsmooth period change when we assume E >159 maxima\nare late superhumps. This identification looks reasonable\nthat E = 159 corresponds to the termination of the main\nsuperoutburst, at which a 0.5 phase jump is known to\nbe most frequently observed (e.g. Haefner et al. 1979;\nVogt 1983). In table 3, we provide E numbers assuming\nthe 0.5 phase jump for E >159.\nA linear regression to the observed superhump times\n(table 3) yielded the following ephemeris:\nHJD(maximum) = 2450422.8750 + 0.060430E.\n\n(1)\n\nThe O \u2212C's given in table 3 were calculated against this\nlinear regression (see figure 12). The superhump period\ninitially increased during the main superoutburst and the\nfirst rebrightening, and the period started to decrease following the main superoutburst.

These findings make a clear\ncontrast to what are observed during the initial stages of\nan ordinary SU UMa-type superoutburst (Warner 1985).\nThe repetitive brightenings less likely represent the start\nof another superoutburst in spite of accompanying superhumps. Instead, they bear more characteristics of normal\noutbursts. The persistent superhumps should be rather\nconsidered to be the consequence of a persistent eccentricity in the accretion disk, and rebrightening must have\noccurred independent of these superhumps.\n\n\fNo. ]\n4.\n4.1.\n\nWZ Sge-type Dwarf Nova EG Cnc\n\nDiscussion\nOutburst Statistics\n\nAs briefly discussed in section 1, no confirmed outburst was observed since the 1977 (discovery) outburst\nuntil 1995. In order to estimate the possibility of missed\noutbursts (owing to the observational gaps) we applied\nMonte-Carlo simulations on actual observations by the\nVSOLJ members. The total number of observations was\n238, distributing between JD 2445344 and 2450933, spanning \u223c15 yr. The results were that 52% of simulated\nsuperoutbursts (the light curve was assumed to identical\nwith the present one) and 86% of simulated normal outbursts (maximum magnitude of 13.3 and decay rate of 1\nmag d\u22121 assumed) were missed. These probabilities can\nbe considered as upper limits, since the VSOLJ database\ncontains no observations by Huruhata himself, and the object had been equally intensively monitored by a number\nof skilled visual observers, including P. Schmeer. Though\nit is still premature to conclude on the previous occurrence of outbursts, the 1-\u03c3 lower limit of recurrence times\nof superoutbursts (Ts ) and normal outbursts (Tn ) can be\nset 4 and 1 yr, respectively, assuming the Poisson statistic\nof the outburst occurrence. The low number of outbursts\nhas been also confirmed by the absence of a confirmed\noutburst in the VSNET observations after the 1996\u20131997\none.\nThese lower limits of recurrence times are located at\nthe longest end of the distribution of Ts among all SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae (e.g. Nogami et al. 1997b; Kato\net al. 2003b).\n4.2.\n\nComparison with the 1977 Outburst\n\nAccording to Huruhata (1983), the 1977 outburst\nstarted between 1977 November 9.8 and 12.8 UT. The\nbrightest measured magnitude was 11.9 on 1977 November\n12.8. Since the photometric sequence of the comparison\nstars by Huruhata closely matches the present scale (M.\nHuruhata, private communication), we can safely compare\nHuruhata's values with our modern V -magnitudes. The\nobject declined to 12.4 mag on November 22.8 UT, 10.9\nd after the initial detection. The duration of the outburst\nindicates that the 1977 outburst was also a superoutburst.\nAfter an observational gap of 11 d, Huruhata (1983) further positively detected the variable on three films taken\nin two separate occasions in early December, giving estimates \u223c14.0 mag 21\u201322 d and 25 d after the initial detection.\nConsidering that the duration of the main superoutburst in 1996 did not exceed 23 d, even taking the observational gap into account, some of these December positive\ndetections may be interpreted as a hint of rebrightenings,\nor a part of a second (super)outburst. The main difference\nfrom the 1996\u20131997 outburst is the faintness (14.0 mag)\nduring this stage. It is, however, clear no evidence was\nfound regarding repeated rebrightenings as in 1996\u20131997,\nand the 1977 outburst seems to more resemble the 1913\nand 1946 outbursts of WZ Sge. It would be important to\nnote the same star at times exhibit different patterns of\n\n11\n\nactivity.\n4.3.\n\nOrbital Period\n\nBased on our own analysis, we propose the period\nof early superhumps (P = 0.05877 d) to be the candidate orbital period. Patterson et al. (1998) alternatively proposed a different (0.05997 d) period, which is\nextremely close to the superhump period. We suspect\nthat this period identification suffered from ambiguity\nfrom two reasons. The spectroscopic period by Patterson\net al. (1998) was not directly from radial velocity variations but from a periodic variation of the asymmetry of\nthe profile. We must note that this method of period\ndetermination could have suffered from the remaining eccentricity in the disk, as would be naturally expected from\nthe long persistence of the superhumps. The photometric\nmethod was even more ambiguous; our own analysis of the\nearly-stage variations gave a different result (Matsumoto\net al. 1998b), which was also favored by quiescent photometry Matsumoto et al. (1998a). We absolutely need\nan independent determination from true radial velocity\nobservation before concluding on the true identification\nof the orbital period. In this paper, we adopt our own\nidentification (P = 0.05877 d) in the following discussion.\n4.4.\n\nEG Cnc as a WZ Sge-Type Dwarf Nova\n\nAs Matsumoto et al. (1998b) pointed out, the optical\nbehavior of the present outburst bears all the characteristics common to those of known WZ Sge-type dwarf novae.\nTable 4 summarizes the comparison of the observed properties between these objects. The late-stage behavior of\nsuperoutbursts has a wide range of diversity between objects, and even between different outbursts of the same\nobject, in spite of the marked similarity of the general\nlight curve and the time evolution of superhumps during\nthe early stage of outbursts.\nPhenomenologically, the superoutbursts of WZ Sgetype dwarf novae seem to make a continuous sequence\nranging from superoutburst without noticeable rebrightenings (WZ Sge in 1913 and 1946), ones accompanied by a\nsingle rebrightening (EG Cnc in 1977; possibly HV Vir in\n1992, cf. Kato et al. 2001b), double to multiple rebrightenings (EG Cnc in 1996\u20131997; UZ Boo in 1994: Kuulkers\net al. 1996), and to two distinct outbursts separated by a\n\"dip\" (WZ Sge in 1978\u20131979, 2001; AL Com in 1961, 1995\nand 2001), some of which may be double superoutbursts.\nA similar idea of a continuum of types of outbursts\nof large-amplitude, infrequently outbursting dwarf novae (Tremendous Outburst Amplitude Dwaef Novae or\nTOADs: Howell et al. 1995a) was discussed in Howell\net al. (1995b), who mainly treated the diversity of duration and brightness of superoutbursts in these systems.\nAn ideal model of WZ Sge-type dwarf novae should reproduce this wide and continuous variety of outburst activity\nby changing some input parameters.\n\n\f12\n\nT.

Figure 13 demonstrates enlarged light curves of each\nrebrightening. The first five rebrightenings showed rather\ncommon outburst behavior: an abrupt rise and a 3-mag\nfade in 3 d. The time needed for the rise is well confined\nto less than 0.4 d from the observations of the fourth and\nfifth rebrightenings. The sixth rebrightening is different,\naccompanied with a slow rise lasting more than a day before reaching maximum.\nA similar phenomenon, but with a lesser amplitude, was\nalso observed in time-resolved CCD photometry of the\nfirst rebrightening (figures 14 and 15). A fast-rising type\nrebrightening occurred at around HJD 2450439, while a\nmore slowly rising brightening followed at around HJD\n2450443 (not counted as one of six major rebrightenings\nbecause of its faintness) shows much a slower rise and faint\n\npeak brightness (the faintness of the peak was also confirmed from the subsequent CCD observations reported to\nthe VSNET).8 Although whether or not this small brightening can be treated in the same context of other (major)\nrebrightenings is an open question, the slow rising stage\nof this small brightening was more analogous to the sixth\nrebrightening, possibly implying the common underlying\nmechanism.\nThe existence of two types (fast-rising and slow-rising)\nof rebrightenings may represent the coexistence of insideout-type and outside-in-type outbursts, more usual ones\nbeing the faster outside-in-type. The sixth rebrightening\nmay be related to the former, \"slow\" rebrightening.\n4.6.\n\nOn the Interpretation of Rebrightenings\n\nSince the disk instability theory predicts the cycle\nlength of normal outbursts, for a certain range of parameters, is roughly inversely proportional to the masstransfer rate (e.g. Ichikawa, Osaki 1994), it would be natural to attribute the increased outburst activity after the\nmain superoutburst to an enhanced mass-transfer somehow caused by the superoutburst. Since the measured\nshort outburst intervals (5\u201310 d) are one of the shortest\neven among frequently outbursting SU UMa-type dwarf\nnovae (cf. Warner 1995; Nogami et al. 1997b), this interpretation would require (assuming no change in other\nparameters before and after the superoutburst) a mass8\n\nWe regard this phenomenon as a kind of rebrightening, not a result of flickering, since the duration (\u223c 1 d) of the phenomenon,\nas well as the continued slow rising for 7 hr, was much longer\nthan the superhump period.\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nWZ Sge-type Dwarf Nova EG Cnc\n\n13\n\n12\n1st\n\n14\n\n14\n\n15\n\n15\n\n16\n\n16\n\n17\n50436 50438 50440 50442\n\nVisual magnitude\n\n12\n13\n\n3rd\n\n0\n\n2nd\n\n13\n\n17\n50442 50444 50446 50448 50450\n12\n\n14\n\n15\n\n15\n\n16\n\n16\n\n2\n\n4\n\n\"slow\" mini-outburst\n\n6\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nTime after maximum (d)\n17\n50450 50452 50454 50456\n12\n13\n\n5th\n\n17\n50454 50456 50458 50460 50462\n12\n6th\n\n13\n\n14\n\n14\n\n15\n\n15\n\n16\n\n16\n\n17\n\n17\n50462 50464 50466 50468\n\n50472 50474 50476 50478\n\nHJD-2400000\n\nHJD-2400000\n\nFig. 13.

The sixth rebrightening seems to be different,\nshowing a slow rising trend more than a day before reaching\nmaximum.\n\n0\n\nRelative V Magnitude\n\n\"fast\" mini-outburst\n\n4th\n\n13\n\n14\n\nRelative magnitude\n\n12\n\n13\n\nDetails of the first mini-outburst\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n50438\n\n50440\n\n50442\n\n50444\n\n50446\n\nHJD - 2400000\n\nFig. 14.

The rebrightening occurring around HJD 2450439\nrepresents a \"fast\" rebrightening, while the small one (not\ncounted as one of six major rebrightenings because of the\nfaintness) occurring around HJD 2450443 shows a much\nslower rise and fainter peak brightness.\n\ntransfer rate something between ordinary SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae and ER UMa stars (Kato, Kunjaya 1995;\nRobertson et al. 1995; Misselt, Shafter 1995; Nogami\net al. 1995; Kato et al. 1999). The ER UMa stars are\npeculiar SU UMa-type stars which are proposed to have\nmass-transfer rates several times higher than in ordinary\nSU UMa-type dwarf novae (Osaki 1995a; Osaki 1995c).\nAlthough the initial pattern and amplitudes of rebrightenings of EG Cnc closely resembled those of ER UMa\nstars, the enhanced mass-transfer and the enhanced hot\nspot brightness would not solely by themselves explain\nthe later behavior, since the brightness of the system was\nshown to decrease gradually (see figure 1), even after the\nsixth rebrightening. This smooth decrease in brightness\nshould require smoothly decreasing frequency of rebrightenings, which is contrary to the observation if the system\nbrightness actually reflects the brightness of the hot spot\nor the mass-transfer rate.\nOsaki et al. (1997) instead proposed a model to reproduce these rebrightenings, by assuming increased quiescent viscosity after the main superoutburst. This model,\nby adjusting the time dependence of the quiescent viscosity and its radial dependence through the disk, could at\nleast reproduce the observed rebrightenings without an\nassumption of an enhanced mass-transfer.\nOsaki et al. (1997) originally suggested that such increased quiescent viscosity is somehow related to the turbulent motion in the disk resulting from the tidal instability. They also proposed the extremely low mass-transfer\nrate in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae would be responsible for\nthe slow circularization of the eccentric disk, leading to the\nslow decrease in the quiescent viscosity after the outburst\nand multiple rebrightenings never seen in usual dwarf no-\n\n\f14\n\nT. Kato et al.\n\nvae. The underlying physical mechanism for the decay\nof the disk viscosity has been recently proposed by Osaki\net al. (2001) by considering a decay of MHD turbulence\nunder the condition of the low magnetic Reynolds numbers in the cold accretion disk (Gammie, Menou 1998).\nA potential difficulty of this model (Osaki et al. 2001)\nis that the disk after the main superoutburst would not\nexpand enough to trigger a second superoutburst as reported in AL Com (Nogami et al. 1997a). [Note that the\noutburst of AL Com after the \"dip\" was not composed\nof recurring small rebrightenings, as observed in the 2001\nsuperoutburst of WZ Sge.]\nHowell et al. (1996) and Kuulkers et al. (1996)9 proposed the idea that some material can be piled up just\nbehind the cooling wave, causing it to be reflected as a\nheating wave, which they considered to cause an additional brightening.\nRegarding the reason why such a condition is predominantly met in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, or TOADs,\nKuulkers et al. (1996) suggested that the stored disk\nmaterial survives being depleted by accretion, owing to\nthe low occurrence of normal outbursts in these systems.\nHowever, the degree of depletion of the disk mass during\none supercycle is rather expected to affect the initial condition of superoutburst, but not necessarily that of the\nlate-stage condition of superoutburst. As Osaki (1995b)\nhas shown, the late stage of WZ Sge-type superoutbursts is expected to follow the same time-evolution as\nthose of usual dwarf novae. The initial excessive matter is effectively accreted on a viscous time-scale; it is\nnot still convincingly clear how the low occurrence of normal outbursts (or its precondition) naturally explains the\nunique late-stage phenomenon in WZ Sge-type superoutbursts. Though the discussion was more limited to SXTs,\nCannizzo et al. (1995) could reproduce a similar pattern of\nrebrightenings by modifying the radial dependence of the\n\u03b1 viscosity. This model, however, would suffer, as in the\nmodel proposed by Osaki et al. (1997), from the depletion\nof high-angular momentum matter necessary to invoke an\nimmediate second superoutburst.\nWe alternately consider a possibility that the matter in\nthe outer accretion disk may be left from being accreted\nduring the main superoutburst, by way of the premature\nquenching of the hot state in the outer disk. We propose the weaker turbulence and resultant heating caused\nby the weaker tidal instability in the outer disk than in\nordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae can be responsible for\nthis possibility. This weaker tidal torque can be reasonably achieved under conditions of extreme mass ratios in\nWZ Sge-type dwarf novae, which can hold the 3:1 reso9\n\nKuulkers et al. (1996) also discussed outburst properties of soft\nX-ray transients (SXTs). At least one of SXTs (GRO J0422+32\n= V518 Per) definitely shows similar rebrightenings (minioutbursts). The cause of such rebrightenings have been discussed (e.g. Chen et al. 1993; Augusteijn et al. 1993). These\nauthors favored the irradiation-induced mass-transfer in SXTs\nas the cause of rebrightenings. As already discussed Kuulkers\net al. (1996), this effect is expected to be much smaller, however, in dwarf novae than in SXTs. See also Kuulkers (1998)\nand Kuulkers (2000) for recent discussions.\n\n[Vol. ,\n\nnance radius well inside the Roche lobe of the primary, or\nthe maximum dimension of the expanded disk. This possibility was originally proposed in 1997 by Kato et al. 1997\nand Kato et al. (1998), which was further explored by\nHellier (2001) and Osaki et al. (2001). The unusual presence of Na D absorption line (Patterson et al. 1998) could\nbe attributed to the cool reservoir in the disk required by\nthis interpretation.\nSuperoutbursts in ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae\nare believed to be triggered when the disk radius, upon\nthe ignition of the outburst, first reaches the radius of\nthe 3:1 resonance during the normally outbursting cycle\n(Osaki 1989). The eccentricity wave (Lubow 1992) caused\nby the tidal instability should naturally start in the outermost region of the disk, and should propagate inward, accounting for the general decrease in the superhump period\nduring superoutbursts of ordinary SU UMa-type dwarf novae (Lubow 1992).\nIn WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, however, the absence of\nnormal outbursts may lead to an accumulation of a large\namount of matter, leading to more violent expansion of the\ndisk during superoutburst enabling the disk expanding beyond the 3:1 resonance. The above picture then predicts\nthe eccentricity wave can propagate outward. The presence of positive period derivatives of superhump periods in\nsome WZ Sge-type dwarf novae and infrequently outbursting, large-amplitude SU UMa-type dwarf novae (e.g. AL\nCom: Nogami et al. 1997a; V1028 Cyg: Baba et al. 2000;\nSW UMa: Semeniuk et al. 1997; Nogami et al. 1998; HV\nVir: Ishioka et al. 2003; see also Kato et al. 2003c for\na recent summary of period derivatives in SU UMa-type\ndwarf novae) would strengthen the idea of the relative difference in the location of generation and propagation of\ntidal instability between WZ Sge-type and ordinary SU\nUMa-type dwarf novae. The extremely low mass-ratios in\nWZ Sge-type dwarf novae could play the key role in generating tidal instability well inside the entire disk radius.\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nWe obtained extensive CCD photometry during the\n1996\u20131997 superoutburst of EG Cnc. This outburst\nshowed an unprecedented series of six major rebrightenings spaced by 5\u201310 d. During this rebrightening stage\nand the following slow fading tail, photometric modulations with a period of 0.0603 d persisted, which is equal\nto the superhump period observed in the latter course of\nthe main superoutburst. We suggest that the superhumps\nobserved during the rebrightening stage and the fading\ntail are a \"remnant\" of usual superhumps, and are not\na result of rebrightenings. By comparison with the 1977\noutburst of this object and outbursts of other WZ Sgetype dwarf novae, we propose an activity sequence of WZ\nSge-type superoutbursts, in which the current outburst\nof EG Cnc is placed between a single-rebrightening event\nand distinct outbursts separated by a dip. We propose a\nnew potential explanation of post-superoutburst behavior\nof the WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, by considering the effect\nof extreme mass ratios in these binaries on the generation\n\n\fNo. ]\n\nWZ Sge-type Dwarf Nova EG Cnc\n\nand propagation of the tidal instability.\nWe are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual and CCD estimates via the\nVSNET alert network, and especially to Patrick Schmeer\nfor his detection and early notification of the longawaited outburst.\nWe are grateful to the VSOLJ\nstaffs and members providing earlier observations.
