While the universal relation between the room-temperature thermopower S290K and the critical\ntemperature is found to hold in the strongly overdoped region (\u03b4>0.14), a strong violation is observed in\nthe underdoped part of the phase diagram. The observed behaviour is compared with other cuprates and\nthe different scenarios are discussed.\n\nIntroduction. \u2013 The determination of the number of holes injected in CuO2 plane, p,\nwhich plays a key role in high-Tc superconductivity, is still an open question. Universal\nempirical behaviour between the thermoelectric power (TEP) at 290 K, S290K, and the ratio\nTc/Tcmax, known as Obertelli-Cooper-Tallon law [1] (OCT), is currently used as a measure of\np. This robust behaviour seems to be valid even in the case of YBa2Cu3O7-\u03b4 where the charge\nis distributed between CuO chains and CuO2 planes. The only known compound where this\nuniversal OCT law fails is the untypical La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) superconductor [2].Quite\nrecently, however, a renewed interest has been raised by the observation of a departure from\nthe OCT trend in the case of Bi2Sr2-zLazCuO6+\u03b4 (Bi(La)-2201) [3, 4].\nHall effect measurements can be also used to determine the hole number p, but in the case\nof the cuprates, the obtained values do not correspond to those expected from chemical\ndetermination [5]. Considering the structure, the average valence of Cu, denoted 2+p, leads\nin the stoichiometric La2-xSrxCuO4 compound to identify p with the concentration of Sr, x. In\nother cuprates, such as Bi2Sr2Can-1CunO2n+4+\u03b4, with determined oxygen excess \u03b4, an\nestimation of p can also be obtained [6], although the charge transfer is more complicated\ndue to the nonstoichiometricity of the structure. An alternative way to estimate p when the\nratio Tc/Tcmax is known is through a phenomenological law proposed by Presland et al. [7].\nAs pointed-out in Ref [3] and included in OCT behaviour itself [1], one can determine that\nthe universal OCT relation holds if the hole number p estimated from phenomenological\nlaw, p(Tc/Tcmax), and from S290K [8], p(S290K), lead to the same value.\n1\n\n\fHere, we present a detailed study on the doping evolution of the thermoelectric power in\nboth Bi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b4 thin films and ceramics in the overall superconducting region. The\nmeasurements on both type of samples appear to be essential to get complementary\ninformation. While in the case of ceramic samples we can determine the oxygen excess \u03b4,\nthey remain intrinsically overdoped [9]. This restriction is overcome by using thin films\nwhich allow access to the strongly underdoped region of the (Tc, \u03b4) phase diagram, but\nwithout direct information about oxygen content in the sample. The observed properties on\nboth types of materials are comparable in the overlap part of the phase diagram. An observed\ndeparture from the universal OCT behaviour is analysed and discussed.\nExperimental methods. \u2013 The single-layered Bi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b4 (Bi-2201) samples are either caxis-oriented epitaxial thin films or polycrystalline samples.\nThin films were grown by RF magnetron sputtering on SrTiO3 substrates [10]. The\noxygen content of a given sample was changed by repeated annealing treatments in\ncontrolled atmosphere from an overdoped state with Tc(R=0)\u223c4.5 K (A1) to a strongly\nunderdoped nonsuperconducting state with Tc(R=0)\u223c0 K (A6). The maximal critical\ntemperature achieved was Tcmax(R=0)\u223c16.5 K (A2). The most highly overdoped sample with\nTc(R=0)\u223c0 K (B) is obtained by an annealing treatment in an oxidising plasma. The doping\nevolution of the resistivity is given elsewhere [11]. The above described annealing procedure\ninduces successive changes in the carrier content in the film in a controlled and reversible\nway [12].\nSintered samples were prepared using a classical solid reaction method [13]. Hole\nconcentration can be adjusted through oxygen excess \u03b4, which has been quantitatively\ncontrolled by thermogravimetric techniques [9,14]. All polycrystalline samples have the\nsame cationic composition. According to electron microprobe analysis, the resulting average\ncation ratio was found to be very close to Bi:Sr:Cu=2:2:1.\nThermoelectric measurements on thin films were performed using a conventional steady\nflow technique. The single-crystal substrate SrTiO3 does not contribute to the measured\nthermopower. Temperature and voltage gradients were simultaneously measured using Ttype (25 \u03bcm) thermocouples fixed on two gold sputtered contact pads. Detailed thermopower\nmeasurements on ceramic samples are published separately [15]. The observed TEP\nproperties are fully reproducible in both thin films and ceramic samples. The critical\ntemperature Tc is determined from the onset of dc magnetisation [16, 17], which is found to\nbe in good agreement with Tc(R=0).\nResults and discussion. \u2013 Typical temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power\nS(T) of Bi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b4 thin films in the overall (Tc, \u03b4) phase diagram is shown in fig.1. The\nmost overdoped (B) and the most underdoped (A6) states are situated at the limit of the\nsuperconducting region with Tc\u223c0, while A2 is in optimally doped state. The results are in\ngood agreement with those obtained for Bi-2201 ceramics [15] with well-controlled oxygen\nexcess \u03b4 [9]. The S(T) behaviour is strongly dependent on the oxygen doping. While a nonmonotonous behaviour is observed for the underdoped states (A2-A6), a marked upward\ncurvature is present in the overdoped states (B, A1). A possible scenario where S arises from\ntwo different drag and diffusion contributions was discussed previously [4,15,18].\n\n2\n\n\f5\nA6\n0\n\nA5\n\n20\n\n0.12\n\n\u03b4\n\n0.08\n\nceramics\nfilms\n\nA3\n\nC\n\n0.16\n\n15\n\nA4\n-5\n\n0.2\n\nTc (K)\n\nS (\u03bcV/K)\n\nIn fig. 2 we show the variation of the critical temperature Tc as a function of the room\ntemperature thermopower S290K. We observe good quantitative agreement between results\nobtained on thin films (closed symbols) and ceramic samples (open symbols). One may\nnotice that in the overall superconducting region the room temperature thermopower remains\nmostly negative (S290K<0). The optimally doped sample (A2) has S290K around -8 \u03bcV/K\ninstead of the zero value expected from the OCT relation. A similar deviation from the\nuniversal relation was already reported in La-doped Bi-2201 single crystals [3], where S290K\n\u223c-6 \u03bcV/K was found in the case of optimally doped Bi2Sr1.7La0.3CuO6+\u03b4.\n\nOD\n\nUD\n\n10\n\nA2\n-10\nB\n\n5\n\nA1\n\n-15\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n0\n\n300\nT (K)\n\nFig. 1\n\n-20\n\n-10\n0\nS290 K (\u03bcV/K)\n\n10\n\nFig. 2\n\nFig. 1. \u2013 Temperature dependence of the thermoelectric power S for Bi-2201 thin films at different\ndoping levels. The doping states, labelled by A1-A6, are obtained by successive annealing treatments\non the same film. B and A6 are situated near the limit of superconducting region (Tc\u223c0), while A2 is\nin an optimally doped state (Tc\u223c16.5 K). C is an intermediary overdoped state (Tc\u223c4.5 K).\nFig. 2. \u2013 Phase diagram (Tc, S290K) of Bi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b4 thin films (closed circles) and ceramics (open\ncircles). The oxygen excess values \u03b4, indicated in the top axis, are determined in the case of ceramic\nsamples [9]. The overdoped (OD) and the underdoped (UD) region are also identify in the figure.\nDotted line is just a guide to the eyes.\n\nIn fig. 3, Tc/Tcmax is plotted as a function of S290K in order to show the disagreement\nbetween the universal behaviour (solid line) and our results obtained on non-substituted Bi2201 (circles). The results reported on La-doped Bi-2201 [3] (dashed line) are also shown in\nthe same figure. In comparison with OCT behaviour, the superconducting region (Tc,S290K)\n3\n\n\fin the Bi-2201 compound is extremely narrow. In the overdoped region, a good agreement is\nobserved between these two single-layer Bi-2201 samples. Moreover, in the strongly\noverdoped region, the doping dependence of Tc/Tcmax is very close to the universal\nbehaviour. At the same time, in the underdoped part, a disagreement is observed between the\nLa-doped Bi-2201 and non-substituted Bi-2201 single-layer, and in both cases the observed\nbehaviour is very different from the universal one. A similar behaviour is also evidenced in\nthe case of the singular branch in Bi(La)-2201 single crystals [4]. On the other hand, LSCO\ncompounds shows completely different behaviour than that of Bi-2201. Over the entire\nsuperconducting range S290K remains positive, converging to the OCT behaviour in the\nstrongly underdoped, non-superconducting part [2].\n\nTc (K)\n\nTc/Tcmax\n\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u03b4\nTc0\n\n20\n10\n\nOD\n\nUD\n0 -20 -10 0 10\nS290 K (\u03bcV/K)\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nBi-2201\n\nBi(La)-2201\n\n0\n\nOCT\n\n50\n\n100\nS290 K (\u03bcV/K)\n\nFig. 3. \u2013 Comparison of Tc/Tcmax vs. S290K between non-substituted Bi-2201 films (closed circles) and\nceramics (open circles) and La-doped Bi-2201 single crystals (dashed line) [3]. Previously\nestablished empirical OCT relation is shown by solid line [1]. Inset: estimation of the fictitious Tcmax0\nvalue from the phenomenological law [7] with p(S290K) [8] (solid line).\n\nTo quantify the agreement between different results, we compare the hole number p\ndetermined from the phenomenological law Tc/Tcmax=1-82.6(p-0.16)2 [7], p(Tc/Tcmax), with\nthat from the OCT relation S290K=24.2-139p in the OD region [8], p(S290K) (fig. 4). The\nagreement between p(Tc/Tcmax) and p(S290K) is observed within 10% (dotted line) in the\nstrongly overdoped region (\u03b4>0.14), while a disagreement between them is observed for\n\u03b4<0.14. As the two determined hole doping numbers are similar in the strongly overdoped\nregion (0.14<\u03b4<0.18), the OCT relation holds within 10%, while it is strongly violated in the\nunderdoped region. As it was discussed previously [3], the failure of the OCT behaviour\ncould come from a somehow reduced either critical temperature or thermoelectric power. In\nthe following we will discuss these two possibilities.\nIf we assume that measured Tc values are somehow reduced from the real ones, without\naffecting the thermoelectric power, we can estimate the fictitious Tc0 values from the\nphenomenological law [7] with the hole number determined from thermopower values\n4\n\n\fp(S290K) (inset of the fig. 3) [19]. In this case all measured samples (except A6) are situated\nin the overdoped region of the phase diagram. However this point remains questionable\nconsidering the general doping tendencies of the normal state properties of cuprates. The\npseudogap opening in the underdoped region [20]. In our case, doping state A2 shows the\nlinear T-variation of the resistivity, characterising the optimal doping state and the lessdoped ceramic sample (\u03b4\u223c0.10) shows the positive slope of the susceptibility \u03c7(T), which is\na signature of the pseudogap effect [17]. Moreover, the estimated fictitious maximal critical\ntemperature Tcmax0\u223c24 K is still lower than expected for single-layer HTC compounds and\ndoes not allow to explain the differences with the maximal critical temperature in the other\nsingle-layer Tl-2201 (Tcmax\u223c85 K) [21] and Hg-1201 (Tcmax\u223c97 K) [22] compounds.\n\n0.3\n\n0.16\n\n0.24\n\n0.32\n\n0.4\n\n100\n\nLSCO\nBi-2201(La)\nBi-2201\n\n50\n\n0.2\n\n\u2206S290 K\n\np (Tc/Tcmax)\n\np (\u03b4)\n0.08\n\n0\n0.1\n\n-50\n0\n\n0.15\n\n0.2\n0.25\np (S290 K)\n\n0\n\n0.3\n\nFig. 4\n\n0.05\n\n0.1 0.15 0.2\np (Tc/Tcmax)\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\nFig. 5\n\nFig. 4. \u2013 The hole number p(Tc/Tcmax) as a function of p(S290K).

Solid line represents OCT behaviour.\n\nWith the goal of analysing the second possibility, a somehow reduced measured\nthermoelectric power from the real one without affecting Tc, the difference between the\nmeasured S290K and empirical behaviour S290KOCT is plotted as a function of p(Tc/Tcmax)\n(circles). The same analysis is done in the case of Bi(La)-2201 data from Ref.[3] (dashed\nline) and LSCO data from Ref.[2] (dashed-dotted line). As it was seen before the\nconvergence of S290K for single-layer Bi-2201 family to OCT behaviour (solid line) is clearly\nindicated. Approaching weak hole numbers, \u2206S290K increases in an approximately\n5\n\n\fexponential way. The LSCO compound shows completely opposite behaviour with negative\n\u2206S290K. The convergence of S290K to S290KOCT is signalled in the strongly underdoped\nnonsuperconducting behaviour [2], whereas a saturation of S290K to around \u223c10 \u03bcV/K is\npresent in the overdoped region. Within the frame of the drag model [18,4], the positive\nthermopower values of LSCO could be explained with the anomalously large contribution of\ndrag, arising from the existing excitation of carriers. In the case of Bi-2201 family, the drag\ncontribution is diminished down to zero leaving only negative diffusion contribution in the\nstrongly overdoped region (\u03b4>0.17) [15]. On the other hand, the anomalously negative\nthermopower in Bi-2201 is possibly related to the underlying electronic structure, giving rise\nto the non-classical Fermi-liquid diffusion [15,23].\nTo avoid the above discrepancy, Ando et al. [3] used the universality of Hall coefficient\nmeasurements in cuprates in order to estimate the hole number p, relaying on the welldetermined p in LSCO family. The predicted fictitious Tc0 values are bigger than the\nmeasured one Tc, even in the overdoped region where our present results indicate a\nconvergence to the universal behaviour. On the other hand, the hole number taken from the\naverage valence of Cu (top axis in fig.4), is also overestimated, in the comparison with other\nhole-number determinations. Finally, the disagreement between p(Tc/Tcmax) [7] and p(S290K)\n[8] can be avoided using a modified phenomenological relation Tc/Tcmax=1-Z(p-popt)2 with Z\nand popt different than the usual values of 82.6 and 0.16 respectively [24]. However, the\ndifference with other single-layer Tl-2201 and Hg-1201 cuprates remains unclear.\nAll the above discussed approaches reveal the complexity of the Bi-2201 family. The\nincrease of the residual resistivity \u03c10 and the appearance of a localisation effect in Bi-2201\n[11] indicate the presence of disorder which could diminish the critical temperature.\nHowever, a reduced critical temperature without influence on the thermopower can not\nexplain the observed untypical behaviour from that of other single-layer compounds. At the\nsame time, the underlying electronic structure, giving rise to the robust negative values of\nthermopower, might be related to the structural distortions found in Bi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b4 [25,26].\nMoreover, the substitution of Sr by La reduces these distortions [25] and approaches Bi(La)2201 to the other cuprates (fig. 3). The observed distortions linked to charge transfer could\nalso lead to the overestimated p values, as determined from the Cu valence. More work is\nnecessary to clarify this point.\nIn summary, we show the detailed doping dependence of thermopower measurements on\nBi2Sr2CuO6+\u03b4 thin films and ceramic samples in the overall superconducting region. The\nresults are in good agreement with the empirical OCT relation in the strongly overdoped\nregion (0.14<\u03b4<0.18), while for \u03b4<0.14, a failure of the OCT behaviour is observed. This\nbehaviour is similar to the doping dependence reported on Bi(La)-2201 samples in the\noverdoped region but it is very different in the underdoped part. The superconducting\n(Tc,S290K) phase diagram appears to be extremely narrow, reflecting anomalous underdoped\nregion in non-substituted Bi-2201, even more anomalous than the one found in La-doped Bi2201.\nWe thank F.
