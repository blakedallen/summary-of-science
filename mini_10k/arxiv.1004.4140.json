Our results suggest that the ground state of a three dimensional\nhyperkagom\u00e9 compound differs distinctly from its frustrated counterparts on a pyrochlore lattice\nand reveals a juxtaposition of spin liquid order and strong dimerised coupling.\nPACS numbers:\n\nIn recent years it has become evident that magnetic\nfrustration provides an excellent path to novel and exotic magnetic order [2? \u20135]. Evocative names such as\nspin liquids, spin glasses and spin ice are associated with\nthe frustration of magnetic spins. In spin liquids the\nenergy scale of interactions between the spins does not\ninfluence the ordering temperature and due to a manifold of degenerate states the spins remain fluctuating at\ntemperatures much lower than the interaction energies.\nAn illustrative example of a spin liquid with a large spin\nvalue S >> 12 , a cooperative paramagnet, is Tb2 Ti2 O7 .\nTb2 Ti2 O7 remains disordered down to the lowest temperatures and displays a spin liquid state [6]. The excitation\nspectrum reveals, in addition to crystal field excitations\n[7], a continuum of fluctuating spins that slow down with\ndecreasing temperature but remain fluctuating down to\n0.05 K [8]. A second example of a cooperative paramagnet is the kagom\u00e9 antiferromagnet deuteronium jarosite\nwhich shows gapless magnetic excitations extending out\nto at least 20 meV with a linear temperature dependence\nof the spin fluctuation rate [9]. These two examples highlight the continuum of liquid-like quasielastic scattering\ntypically observed in a cooperative paramagnet and conform to the prediction by Moessner et al. that a system\nof classical spins on some frustrated lattices will observe\na linear temperature dependence of the spin fluctuation\nrate [10, 11].\nContrary to expectation this work presents, to our\nknowledge, the first inelastic neutron scattering study\non a three dimensional (3D) hyperkagom\u00e9 structure,\nGd3 Ga5 O12 (GGG) in which we show spin liquid order\nthat is concomitant with distinct gapped modes pointing towards singlet-triplet excitations arising from short\nrange antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations. These results\n\nthus shed new light on the spin dynamics of frustrated\nhyperkagom\u00e9 structures.\n\nFIG. 1: The garnet structure of GGG with two interpenetrating hyperkagom\u00e9 lattices showing the interatomic, intertriangular and inter hyperkagom\u00e9 exchange interactions, J1 ,\nJ2 and J3 , respectively. For clarity only the Gd3+ are shown.\n\nStructurally, rare earth garnets such as GGG are one\nof very few realizations of a hyperkagom\u00e9 structure, a 3D\nlattice of corner sharing triangles. Another recently created hyperkagom\u00e9 compound is Na4 Ir3 O8 , [12]. In fact,\nGGG consists of two interpenetrating hyperkagom\u00e9 lattices with the triangulated nearest neighbors linked via\nan exchange interaction, J1 , while individual triangles\nare coupled through 2nd nearest neighbor interactions,\nJ2 and the two hyperkagom\u00e9 lattices linked via a third\nnearest neighbor term J3 [13]. In GGG the magnetic\n\n\f2\nGd3+ spins are isotropic (S = 7/2) and are often considered as Heisenberg spins due to single ion anisotropy\nof less than 0.04 K [14]. However the non-negligible\ndipole exchange, D = 0.7 K, could lead to anisotropy\n[13]. Magnetically GGG shows a Curie-Weiss temperature of -2.3 K indicative of AF correlations but does not\norder down to 0.025 K [13, 15]. Although indications of\nshort range order was hinted at by bulk measurements\n[15, 16], proof was obtained by neutron diffraction that\nrevealed a spin liquid-like ground state down to 0.14 K\nwith the development of sharper but not resolution limited magnetic diffraction peaks below 0.14 K [1] in addition to the spin-liquid like scattering. Interestingly long\nrange magnetic order is achieved via the application of\nonly 1 Tesla [17, 18].\nThe dynamic nature of GGG has previously been studied first via the indirect measurement of \u03bcSR. Two \u03bcSR\nstudies confirmed the absence of long range order down\nto 0.025 K, however these studies disagree on the nature\nof the slowing down of the spin fluctuations. In a study\nby Dunsiger et al. [19], a linear decrease of Gd spin fluctuations was observed below 1 K which extrapolated to\n8.2 \u03bceV at 0 K while Marshall et al. [20], also determined\nthe slowing down of fluctuations but observed a temperature independent relaxation below 0.2 K. A more direct study, by M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy [21], observed the\nfluctuating Gd spins down to 0.027 K with a decrease in\nspin fluctuating rate from 11.9 \u03bceV at 0.4 K to 0.12 \u03bceV\nat 0.09 K. Most recently, Ghosh et al. [22] pointed to a\nnew dynamical phenomena, in the low temperature phase\nbelow 0.14 K, in which fluctuating uncompensated moments coexist with unsaturated AF order and quantum\nprotectorates of defect centered clusters.\nTheoretically Yavorks'kii et al. [23] were able to reproduce the spatial correlations of the low temperature\n(T< 0.14 K) phase by taking into account the nearest\nneighbor and the nearly infinite dipole exchange interactions, J = 0.107 K [13] and D = 0.7 K [24]. Yavorks\"kii et al. showed that J and D are perturbed by\nmuch smaller exchange interactions J2 and J3 [23, 24]\nand these smaller components dictate the incommensurate ordering wavevector of the low temperature phase\nT< 0.14 K. The work in this Letter presents inelastic neutron measurements on polycrystalline GGG from which\nwe obtain both spatial and temporal information [25].\nNeutron time-of-flight measurements were performed at\nthe spectrometer IN5 of the Institut Laue-Langevin [26].\nIN5 was set up to an incident energy of Ei = 1.94 and 3.27\nmeV with average elastic linewidths of 50 and 80 \u03bceV,\nrespectively, full width at half maximum (FWHM). The\nresolution was determined using a standard incoherent\nscatterer. The temperature dependence of the scattering\nfunction S(Q, \u03c9) was measured between 0.06 and 9 K.\nThe instrumental background was measured using an\nidentical empty cell at 2 K and subtracted from the raw\ndata. The sample used in this work is that used in the\nprevious work of Petrenko et al. [1] containing 99.98 %\nof the non-absorbing isotope 160 Gd. High resolution neu-\n\ntron diffraction using D1A of the Institut Laue Langevin,\n\u03bb = 1.9 \u00c5, was used to determine the upper level of a\npossible disorder on the Ga/Gd sites. The refinement revealed a fully stochiometric sample, the error of the site\noccupations indicated the upper limit of disorder to less\nthan 2%.\nS( Q, \u03c9) at 0.06 K is shown in Fig.2. Clearly there\n\nFIG. 2: Powder averaged scattering function S(Q, \u03c9) of GGG\nat 0.06 K with incident Ei = 1.94 meV. Insert is a cut at\nwavevector transfer = 0.5 \u00c5\u22121 showing the elastic lineshape\nand two low lying excitations with the corresponding fits as\ndescribed in the text.\n\nis a first inelastic contribution at E = 0.58(3) meV. The\nlower energy contributions are more easily understood by\ntaking a cut at constant wavevector transfer, see inset of\nFig.2, and are well described by a Gaussian elastic line,\nthe FWHM of which is fixed by the vanadium standard,\nand two further inelastic contributions at 0.04(1) and\n0.14(2) meV. To avoid confusion the three excited states\nare henceforth named INS1 (0.04 meV), INS2 (0.14 meV)\nand INS3 (0.58 meV). The inelastic scattering cross sections can be characterized by the dispersion relation, lifetime (\u03c4 \u223c \u0393\u22121 ) and intensity. These parameters can be\nobtained by linking the neutron inelastic magnetic excitation to the dynamic susceptibility via\nS(Q, \u03c9) =\n\n00\n1\n{n(\u03c9) + 1)}F 2 (Q)\u03c7 (Q, \u03c9),\n\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere F (Q) is a dimensionless structure factor that follows the magnetic form factor and {n(\u03c9)+1)} is the thermal population factor. The dynamical susceptibility can\nbe further described by a Lorentzian form corresponding\n\n\f3\nto an exponential decay of excitations in time, written in\nterms of a damped harmonic oscillator:\n00\n\n\u03c7 (Q, \u03c9) =\n\n4\u03c9\u03c9q \u0393q\n,\n(\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03a92q )2 + 4\u03c9q2 \u03932q\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a92q = \u03c9q2 + \u03932q , \u0393q is a q-dependent linewidth, corresponding to the FWHM of the peak. Furthermore the\nfit function is convolved with the instrumental resolution\n[26].\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Elastic scattering cross section at 0.06 and\n0.025 K. (b) Difference in elastic scattering cross section between 0.06 and 0.25 K. The dashed line corresponds to longish\nranged ordered peaks observed by Petrenko et al. [1]\n\nThe data has been characterized at each position of\nwavevector transfer. Fig. 3(a) shows the elastic scattering observed at 0.06 and 0.25 K which represents 82 %\nof the total scattering. This scattering is reminiscent of\na spin liquid-like structure factor. In addition, incommensurate Bragg peaks corresponding to longer range\ncorrelations develop below 0.14 K within the elastic line.\nThe resolution of the elastic line gives an upper limit of\n50 \u03bceV for the spin fluctuation rate probed. Previous\n\u03bcSR [19, 20] and M\u00f6ssbauer measurements [? ] indicate fluctuation rates around 8.2 \u03bceV which this data\nwill not be sensitive to. However, the extra scattering\nthat develops below 0.25 K , Fig.3 (b), shows features\nof interest, marked by the dashed lines, representing the\nscattering from longer range static correlations first observed by Petrenko et al. [1] and theoretically reproduced\n\nby Yavorks'kii et al. [23]. Although longer range correlations exist there is no sign of associated spin waves. It\nis possible that these are too weak to be observed since\nthe correlations remain finite on the scale of 100 \u00c5 [1].\nThe three inelastic peaks, INS1, INS2 and INS3 are all\ndispersionless within the resolution probed. These excitations do not originate from either local vibrational\nexcitations nor crystal field excitations since their dependence on wavevector transfer neither increases with\n|Q|, as would be expected from local vibrational excitations, nor follow the Gd3+ form factor expected for\ncrystal field excitations [25, 27]. The possibility that the\nhigher level excitation is a crystal field excitation affected\nby an internal molecular field can be excluded as this is\nnot compatible with the specific heat data [13, 28].\nFig.4(a) shows the wavevector dependence of the integrated intensity of the three inelastic peaks. The intensity of INS3 at 0.06 K, integrated in energy across the\nregion of interest, reveals spatial correlations corresponding to the scattering cross section expected from a triplet\nexcitation above a ground state of singlet dimers [29]. In\nthis case, a dimer can be understood as short range order\nof AF coupled spins within a cluster effectively shielded\nfrom its neighboring cluster. Magnetic interactions between clusters can therefore be neglected. The neutron\nscattering cross section for such a ground state is given\nby\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd2 \u03c3\nsin(Qd)\n2\n\u221d A(T )F (Q) 1 \u2212\n,\n(3)\nd\u03a9d\u03c9\nQd\nwhere d is the separation between spins, F (Q) is the\nGd3+ magnetic form factor [27] and A(T ) is a temperature scaling factor linked to the canonical partition function proportional to the thermal distribution of the singlet ground state and the triplet excited state, A(T ) =\n1/(1 + 3exp(\u2212JGdN N /kB T )), with T = temperature, kB\nthe Boltzmann constant and JGdN N is the nearest neighbor exchange energy JGdN N = JN N S(S + 1) = 1.68K\n[29]. The dashed lines in Fig.4(a) correspond to spatial\ncorrelations with near neighbor exchange interaction (-), d = 3.7915 \u00c5 and next nearest exchange interaction\n(-*-) d = 5.7916 \u00c5. Clearly the data are well described by\na model including only near neighbor exchange interactions. The energy FWHM of this excited state at 60 mK\nis equivalent to the instrumental resolution, thus indicating strong coupling between dimerized Gd moments.\nThe inset of Fig. 4(a) shows the integrated intensity of\nthe wavevector transfer of INS1, INS2, obtained with incident neutron energy Ei = 1.94 meV to optimize resolution. The variation of width and position of the peaks do\nnot exceed the resolution of the instrument and are thus\nconsidered as constants. The wavevector dependence of\nthe integrated intensity of INS1 follows closely the short\nrange order behavior of INS3, the dashed line represents\nthe lineshape of Eqn. ??. At low and high wavevector transfer the model of short range correlations fails\nindicating that extra terms remain important for a full\ndescription of the ground state. The integrated intensity\n\n\f4\nof INS2 shows a minima close to the position in reciprocal\nspace that corresponds to nearest neighbor correlations\nindicating that the origin of INS2 is very different to that\nof INS1 and INS3.\nThe temperature dependence of the normalized integrated intensities of INS1, INS2 and INS3 is shown in\nFig.4(b)(top). The dashed line represents the thermal\nbehavior expected from a singlet-triplet excitation, A(T ),\nwith an exchange interaction JGdN N = 1.68 K, the near\nneighbor exchange interaction obtained by Schiffer et al.\n[16]. The dashed line follows closely the integrated intensity of INS3 thus further validating the notion of a\ndimerized short range AF ordered state. Neither INS1\nnor INS2 follow the temperature dependence of INS3.\nThe integrated intensity of the INS1 excitation follows\na trend similar to INS3, albeit with a reduced exchange\ninteraction J = 1.3 K, up to 0.6 K but at higher temperatures does not follow this trend. The integrated intensity\nof INS2 has a maxima at 0.6 K.\nFurther information concerning the INS3 excitation is\nrevealed in Fig. 4(b)(bottom). Unlike INS1 and INS2,\nINS3 shows a strong temperature dependence in its energy position and the excitation lifetime. The peak energy position can be followed by a power law function\nwith parameters \u03b2 = 0.12(1) and falls to zero at T =\n1.67(2) K. The excitation lifetime can be described by\nthe algebraic form \u03c4 = A T\u03be with \u03be = 0.84 \u00b1 0.21 and\nA diverges to the inverse of the instrument resolution at\n0.06 K, see the inset of Fig. 4(b)(bottom). The relevance\nof these parameters becomes clear when reviewing recent\ntheoretical work by Robert et al. [30] showing that, in\ncontrast to the pyrochlore lattice [10, 11, 31], sufficient\ntemporal and spatial stiffness in a classical kagom\u00e9 antiferromagnet can give rise to magnetic excitations corresponding to acoustic and optical modes in addition to a\nsoft mode.\nThese excitations depend strongly on the temperature regime. At high temperatures (T /J \u2265 0.2 ) only\na quasielastic signal centered at 0 meV is expected. On\ndecreasing T /J from 0.2 to 10\u22122 the quasielastic signal\nsplits into two excitations, an acoustic mode and a nondispersive soft mode that softens with decreasing temperature below T /J \u2264 10\u22122 . An optical mode develops at \u03c9\n= 2J for T /J < 5e\u22123. Furthermore, the theoretical excitations are characterized by the temperature dependence\nof their lifetime with an algebraic dependence \u03c4 = AT \u03be\nwith \u03be = 0.995 for quasielastic scattering and \u03be = 0.18\nfor inelastic scattering in the regime of cooperative paramagnetism, T /J \u2264 0.1. The temperature regime probed\nin this work extends from the partially ordered phase at\n0.06 K into the paramagnetic regime at 1.2 K corresponding to 0.04<T /J<0.7 (with J = 1.68 K).\nThe excitations observed cannot be assigned to acoustic excitations which would remain dispersive and originate from Bragg peaks, even with powder averaging.\nHowever it is possible to assign the non-dispersive gapped\nexcitations to the optical or soft modes with a high energy\nmode at \u03c9 = 4J and not 2J as predicted [30]. Robert cal-\n\nculated the excitations for a classical Heisenberg kagom\u00e9\nAF. It is well known that substantial long range dipole\nexchange interactions play an important role, such a\nmode would therefore be lifted upwards due to further\nexchange interactions and could therefore be observed at\n\u03c9 = 4J. Analogous to phonons, a magnetic optical mode\ncan arise from a localized perturbation of interactions as\nfound in the short range dimerized interactions displayed\nby INS1 and INS3.\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Integrated intensity of INS3 as a function of\nwavevector transfer. The dashed lines correspond to a model\nof short range AF correlation with only near neighbor (\u2013)\nor next nearest neighbor correlations (-*-).

The data indicate that the longer range order, observed below 0.14 K in previous diffraction work\n\n\f5\nis static and does not impact on the behavior of the\nhigher energy spectral density which can be linked to\nthe partially ordered state of GGG. 82 % of the scattering is static with a fluctuation rate of less than 0.05 \u03bceV\nincorporating a large component of the spin liquid-like\nstructure factor. The remaining spectral weight lies in\nthree gapped magnetic excitations two of which can be\n\nmodeled with the spatial dependence of short range AF\ndimer-like correlations. This is highly unusual in a compound with a ground state manifold in which a continuum of excitations is expected to be characteristic of the\ndynamic nature of the magnetic ground state, thus leading to a new class of magnetic dynamic order for hyperkagom\u00e9 compounds.\n\n[1] O.
