Neutral alkali atoms have the potential to be very well suited for this purpose due to\ntheir electronic structure which involves long lived nuclear spins and very sensitive highly excited\nRydberg states. In this paper we describe a fabrication method based on quartz glass to structure\narbitrary shapes of microscopic vapor cells. We show that the usual spectroscopic properties known\nfrom macroscopic vapor cells are almost unaffected by the strong confinement.\n\nRecently a number of quantum devices such as single\nphoton sources, quantum gates and memories, and\nrepeaters have been realized.[1, 2] It is now desirable to\naccomplish an integrable common technological platform\nfor quantum networks with such components. Based\non their electronic structure which involves long lived\nnuclear spins, very sensitive highly excited Rydberg\nstates and technically convenient optical transitions\nneutral alkali atoms have the potential to serve for this\npurpose. Scalable single photon sources can potentially\nbe realized by using the Rydberg blockade.[3] For this\na confinement of the atoms on a scale smaller than\nthe blockade radius (typically a few micrometers) is\nrequired. Recently it was demonstrated that glass\nwalls do not lead to detrimental dephasing of Rydberg\natoms in micrometer-sized vapor cells.[4] Hence they\nare promising candidates to serve as a scalable single\nphoton source. Combined with an integrated linear\noptical network fed by those single photon sources\nand an integrated quantum memory for those photons\nbased on the long lived nuclear spin in integrable dense\nthermal vapor cells, all the necessary components for\na quantum network can potentially be realized in a\nholistic approach.[5] A crucial technological step is the\nfabrication and filling of micrometer-sized alkali vapor\ncells. The miniaturization of alkali vapor cells with\na focus on metrology applications has already been\nbrought forward.[6] Another approach is based on the\nARROWS technology.[7] Also hollow fibers have been\nfilled with thermal and cold atoms.[8\u201310]\nIn this paper we describe a fabrication method to structure arbitrary shapes of vapor cells with micrometer\nresolution based on Optical Bonding Of Vacuum Atom\nCells (OBOVAC). We show that the filling of these\nmicrometer-sized cells can be carried out and that the\nusual spectroscopic properties known from larger cells\nare almost not affected by the confinement. Due to\nthe very convenient optical access and the good optical\nquality of the microcells the spatial addressing of the\ncells is straightforward. We use standard absorption and\nfluorescence spectroscopy methods in a confocal setup\nto determine the spatial distribution and the optical\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n110 \u03bcm\n20 \u03bcm\n\n10 \u03bcm\n20 \u03bcm\n\n(d)\n15 mm\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Etched channels and dots ranging from 20 to 200\n\u03bcm.

The vapor cells are\nmade of two quartz substrates with the dimensions 15 x\n15 x 5 mm3 . The shape of the micrometer-sized structures which provide the confinement for the rubidium\nvapor is defined by photolithographic methods. First\none of the substrates is spin-coated with photoresist\nwhich is subsequently exposed using a photomask. The\nexamples shown here are either u-formed paths with\nwidths of 10 \u03bcm or 100 \u03bcm or more complex patterns\n(see Fig. 1(a)). After the development of the photoresist\nthe exposed areas are removed and the structures are\n\n\f2\n\nWe performed spatially resolved absorption spectroscopy as well as confocal fluorescence spectroscopy\nto confirm that the fabrication and the filling of the\nmicrocell produced by OBOVAC technology was accomplished. We used two stabilized laser diodes, one\nat 780 nm and one at 776 nm. The density of the\nrubidium atoms in the cell and hence the optical density\nis adjusted by heating the reservoir. The substrates are\nalways kept at a higher temperature than the reservoir to\navoid condensation of rubidium in the microstructures.\nThe lasers pass the cell perpendicular to the contact\nsurface of the substrates, and only 10 \u03bcm of rubidium\nvapor are crossed. To be able to resolve structures\nin the micrometer regime the beams are focused with\na microscope objective with a numerical aperture of\n0.55 and a working distance of 13 mm, which results\nin a beam width at the focal point of \u223c 3 \u03bcm. The\nobjective is also used to collect the light emitted by\nthe atoms during the fluorescence measurements. The\ncell is mounted on a translation stage with an accuracy\nof 0.5 \u03bcm and is moved with respect to the fixed\nposition of the focal point to obtain spatially resolved\nsignals. At a cell temperature of 180\u25e6C and a reservoir\ntemperature of 160\u25e6C absorption spectra have been\ntaken at various positions in the spectroscopy cell. For\nthe fluorescence spectroscopy the laser diode at 780\nnm is locked to the 87 Rb 5S1/2 F = 2 \u2192 5P3/2 F = 3\ntransition, and the laser diode at 776 nm is locked to\nthe 87 Rb 5P3/2 F = 3 \u2192 5D5/2 F = 4 transition for the\n\nAbsorption\nFluorescence\n5 \u03bcm\n\nSignal (a.u.)\n\ntransfered to the substrate by wet etching. The depth\nof the structures can be varied by changing the etching\ntime. We have chosen the etching time such that we\nobtain structures with a depth of approximately 10 \u03bcm.\nAs this depth requires a relatively long etching time the\nobtained structures were broadened due to the isotropic\netching behavior. This resulted in trenches with trapezoidal cross sections ranging from \u223c 20 to \u223c 40 \u03bcm\nand from \u223c 110 to \u223c 135 \u03bcm. A scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM) picture of a trench is shown in Figure\n1(b). Closing the trenches results in micrometer-sized\nchannels. Therefore, the structured substrate is covered\nwith a second substrate in optical contact. The covering\nsubstrate is prepared with two blind holes so that it is\nstill possible to reach the etched structures from the\noutside. Subsequently, the two substrates are fused\ntogether at the edges of the contact surface. To fill the\ncell with rubidium a tube is connected to the blind hole.\nWith this tube the whole cell is connected to a vacuum\napparatus, which allows us to fill the tube\u0001with rubidium\nunder vacuum conditions < 10\u22126 mbar . Afterwards\na liquid droplet of rubidium is filled into the tube and\nthe spectroscopy cell is separated from the vacuum\napparatus. The spectroscopy cell thus consists of the\ntwo substrates and the tube which serves as rubidium\nreservoir (Fig. 1(d)).\n\n5D5/2\n\n6P3/2\n776 nm\n\n420 nm\n\n5P3/2\n780 nm\n\n5S1/2\n\n0\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nPosition (\u03bcm)\n20 \u03bcm\n40 \u03bcm\n\nFIG. 2: Results of the spatially resolved absorption and fluorescence measurements.

Afterwards the atoms decay via the\n6P3/2 state with a fluorescence at 420 nm back into the\nground state, which is analyzed with a spectrometer.\nThe advantage of proving the presence of rubidium\nwith this kind of spectroscopy is its background-free\nscheme, as the detected light is spectrally well separated\nfrom the excitation lasers. At various positions in the\nspectroscopy cell the fluorescence signal was detected at\na cell temperature of 190\u25e6 C and a reservoir temperature\nof 130\u25e6 C. Figure 2 shows the maximum absorption of the\n87\nRb 5S1/2 F = 2 \u2192 5P3/2 F = 1, 2, 3 transition as well\nas the detected fluorescence light at 420 nm for a scan\nacross the channel with the trapezoidal cross section\nranging from \u223c 20 to \u223c 40 \u03bcm. As the temperature\nand thus the rubidium density was kept constant in the\nexperiments both the absorption and the fluorescence\nsignal depend essentially on the vapor layer thickness.\nThe fact that absorption as well as fluorescence itself can\nbe observed shows that the filling of the spectroscopy cell\nwas accomplished. Furthermore the comparison of the\nspatial dependence of the signals with the trench widths\nobtained with the SEM confirms that the rubidium is\nconfined to the structures etched into the substrate.\nAbsorption spectra for reservoir temperatures ranging\nfrom 90\u25e6 C up to 240\u25e6 C have been taken to show that\nthe optical density of the thermal rubidium vapor can\nbe varied over a large range.

The inset in Figure\n3 shows some of the spectra. A function assuming a\nVoigt profile for all the involved transitions was fitted to\nthe data. From the fits the optical density at the 85 Rb\n5S1/2 F = 3 \u2192 5P3/2 F = 4 resonance was calculated.\nThe results are presented in Figure 3 showing that\noptical densities of more than 17 can be reached. For\ntemperatures up to 190\u25e6 C the optical density of a thermal vapor only taking into account Doppler broadening\nand assuming a rubidium density calculated from the\nvapor-pressure model given by [11] was fitted to the\nresults with the offset temperature as fitting parameter.\nThis leads to a systematic correction of the temperature\nby \u223c \u22127 K which is most likely caused by the temperature sensor being separated a few millimeters from the\nreservoir. The resulting optical density is also shown\nin Figure 3. The discrepancy for higher temperatures\nresults from an increasing linewidth of the Lorentzian\ncontribution to the Voigt profile. This is possibly due to\nan additional collisional broadening caused by material\ndesorbing from the quartz and will be investigated in\nfurther work. We performed electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT) measurements in the 20 \u03bcm channel\nto confirm that the confining walls do not introduce\n\nWe introduced the OBOVAC technology which is a\nmethod to fabricate arbitrary shapes of vapor cells. Spatially resolved absorption and fluorescence measurements\nin such a cell demonstrated that the fabrication and the\nfilling of these micrometer-sized cells can be carried out.\nWe also performed EIT measurements which proved that\ncoherent spectroscopy is also possible in these cells. We\nplan to extend this approach to cell dimensions as small\nas 1 \u03bcm both in thickness and transverse size. We plan to\nintegrate optical waveguides and test various coatings in\nfuture experiments. We envision that the presented technology enables a platform for room temperature quantum\nnetworks based on thermal vapor cells.\nWe acknowledge the assistance and the fruitful discussions with H.
