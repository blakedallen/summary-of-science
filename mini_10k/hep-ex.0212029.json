Data are presented and\ndiscussed.\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe quantum chromodynamics hadron spectrum includes doubly charmed baryons\n++\n+\n++\n(DCBs): \u039e+\ncc (ccd), \u039ecc (ccu), and \u03a9cc (ccs), as well as the triply charmed \u03a9ccc (ccc). A 1996\nDCB review [1] collected information on masses, lifetimes, internal structure, production cross\nsections, decay modes, branching ratios, yields, and experimental requirements for optimizing\nthe signal and minimizing the backgrounds. DCB works published since then are given in\nRefs. [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The doubly and triply charmed baryons provide a new window\nfor understanding the structure of all baryons. As pointed out by Bjorken [11], one should\nstrive to study the triply charmed (ccc) baryon. Its excitation spectrum, including several\nnarrow levels above the ground state, should be closer to the perturbative regime than is the\ncase for the DCBs. The (ccq) studies are a valuable prelude to such (ccc) efforts.\nHadron structures with size scales much less than 1/\u039bqcd should be well described by\nperturbative QCD. The tightly bound color antitriplet (cc)3\u0304 diquark in (ccq) may satisfy this\ncondition. But the DCB radius may be large, if it is dominated by the low mass q orbiting\nthe tightly bound (cc) pair. The study of such configurations and their weak decays can help\nto set constraints on models of quark-quark forces [12, 13]. Stong [14] emphasized how the\nQQq excitation spectra can be used to phenomenologically determine the QQ potential, to\ncomplement the approach taken for QQ\u0304 quarkonium interactions.\nSavage and Wise [15] discussed the (ccq) excitation spectrum for the q degree of freedom\n(with the (cc) in its ground state) via the analogy to the spectrum of Q\u0304q mesons, where the\n(cc) pair plays the role of the heavy Q\u0304 antiquark. Fleck and Richard [12] calculated excitation\nspectra and other properties of (ccq) baryons for a variety of potential and bag models,\nwhich describe successfully known hadrons. In contrast to heavy mesons, the descriptions of\nlight quark (qqq) and singly charmed (cqq) baryons are less successful.

The investigation of\nthe (ccq) system should help put constraints on baryon models, including light quark (qqq)\nand singly charmed (cqq) baryons, since the (ccq) has a quark structure intermediate between\n(qqq) proton and Q\u0304q meson structures.\nIn the double-charm system, there have been many predictions for the masses of the J=1/2\nstates and the J=3/2 hyperfine excitations [9]. Most results are consistent with expectations\nof a ground state mean mass around 3.6 GeV/c2 . The (cc) color antitriplet diquark has spin\nS=1. The spin of the third quark is either parallel (J=3/2) or anti-parallel (J=1/2) to the\ndiquark. For (ccq), the J=1/2 states are expected to be lower than the J=3/2 states by around\n80 MeV/c2 [9, 10, 12, 16].\nBjorken [11] and also Fleck and Richard [12] suggest that internal W exchange diagrams\nin the \u039e+\ncc decay could reduce its lifetime to around 100f s, roughly half the lifetime of the\n+\n\u039bc . Considering possible constructive interference between the W-exchange and two c-quark\ndecay amplitudes, it is possible that this state should have an even shorter lifetime.\nWe describe qualitatively the perturbative production mechanism for DCBs. One must\nproduce two c quarks (and associated antiquarks), and they must join to a tightly bound,\nsmall size anti-triplet pair. The pair then joins a light quark to produce the final (ccq). The\ntwo c-quarks may be produced (initial state) with a range of separations and relative momenta\n(up to say tens of GeV/c). In the final state, if they are tightly bound in a small size (cc)\npair, they should have relative momentum lower than roughly 1 GeV/c. The overlap integral\nbetween initial and final states determines the probability for the (cc)-q fusion process. Such\ncross sections may be smaller by as much as 10\u22122 -10\u22123 compared\nto single-charm production.\n\u221a\nAoki et al. [17] reported a low statistics measurement at s =26 GeV/c2 for the ratio of\ndouble to single open charm pair production, of 10\u22122 . This D D\u0304D D\u0304 to D D\u0304 cross section ratio\nwas for all central and diffractive events. This high ratio is encouraging for (ccq) searches.\nCross section guestimates are given in Ref. [1].\nBrodsky and Vogt [18] suggested that there may be significant intrinsic charm (IC) cc\u0304 components in hadron wave functions, and therefore also ccc\u0304c\u0304 components. The double intrinsic\ncharm component can lead to (ccq) production, as the (cc) pairs pre-exist in the incident\nhadron. Intrinsic charm (ccq) production, with its expected high Xf distribution, would\ntherefore be especially attractive. When a double charm IC state is freed in a soft collision,\nthe charm quarks should also have approximately the same velocity as the valence quark.\nThus, coalescence into a (ccq) state is likely. Cross section guestimates are given in Ref. [1].\nThe semileptonic and nonleptonic branching ratios of (ccq) baryons were estimated by\nBjorken [11] in 1986. He uses a statistical approach to assign probabilities to different decay\nmodes. He first considers the most significant particles in a decay, those that carry baryon or\nstrangeness number. Pions are then added according to a Poisson distribution. The Bjorken\nmethod and other approaches for charm baryon decay modes are described by Klein [19]. For\n+ + \u2212 +\nthe \u039e++\ncc , Bjorken [11] estimated the \u039bc \u03c0 K \u03c0 final state to have 5% branching ratio; while\n+\n+ + \u2212\nfor the \u039ecc , he estimated the \u039bc \u03c0 K final state to have 3% branching ratio. One expects [1]\nthat roughly 80% of the (ccq) decays are hadronic, with as many as one-third of these leading\nto final states with all charged hadrons.\n\n3\n\nObservation of DCBs at Fermilab SELEX\n\nThe SELEX experiment (E781) at Fermilab [20, 21, 22, 23] carries out DCB data analysis\nbased on the sample of 1630 \u039b+\nc and 10210 D-meson events from lifetime studies of these\nparticles. SELEX used 600 GeV/c beams of \u03c0 \u2212 , \u03a3\u2212 , and protons to produce charm particles\nin Carbon and Copper targets, detecting them with a magnetic spectrometer with high mass\nresolution (\u2248 5 MeV /c2 ) and high proper lifetime resolution (\u2248 20 fs.), and Cerenkov particle\nidentification of particles above 25 GeV/c.\n3\n\n\f+\n\u039bc\nVertex\n\nccd\nVertex\n\nPrimary\nVertex\n\nK\n\nBeam\nTrack\n\np\n\n\u03c0+\n\nL1\n\nK\n\nL\n\n+\n\u039ecc\n\n\u03c0+\n\n-\n\n2\n\nDecay Schematic\n\n\u2212 + +\nFigure 1: Schematic of \u039e+\ncc \u2192 K \u03c0 \u039bc\n\nSELEX has two statistically-compelling new high-mass states near 3.5 GeV/c2 decaying to\n\u2212 + +\n2\n+\n(3460 MeV/c2 ) and \u039b+\nc K \u03c0 \u03c0 (3520 MeV/c ) decay channels of DCBs \u039ecc (ccd)\n(ccu) [24, 25].

The 3520 MeV/c state satisfies all expectations for being\na \u039e+\ncc state. Its mass is compatible with most model calculations for the DCB ground state.\nIts lifetime is shorter than 30 fs at 90% confidence. The 3460 MeV/c2 state has the decay\ncharacteristics of a \u039e++\ncc state, and a comparable lifetime. However, it is difficult to understand\nthe 60 MeV/c2 mass difference between the Q=1 and Q=2 states if they are members of the\nground state isodoublet. It is not yet confirmed that J = 1/2 for both states.\nSELEX analysis and simulations continue for the charmed Lambda (\u039bc ) decay-mode DCB\ndata. SELEX also searches for the states observed to date in decay channels where the final\nstate has a charmed D-meson rather than a \u039bc -baryon. Continuing SELEX data analysis\naims to achieve a more complete understanding of the double charm sector, production with\ndifferent beam particles, decay modes, cross sections and their A-dependence, XF and pt\ndistributions.\n\n\u2212 +\n\u039b+\nc K \u03c0\nand \u039e++\ncc\n\n3.1\n\nFeatures of the Selex spectrometer\n\nSELEX is a 3-stage magnetic spectrometer [20]. The negative 600 GeV/c Fermilab Hyperon\nBeam had about equal fluxes of \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03a3\u2212 . The positive beam was 92% protons. For charm\nmomenta in a range of 100-500 Gev/c, mass resolution is constant and primary (secondary)\nvertex resolution is typically 270 (560) \u03bcm. A RICH detector labelled all particles above\n25 GeV/c, greatly reducing background in charm analyses. [21]. The details of single-charm\n\u2212 +\nanalyses involving \u039b+\nc \u2192 pK \u03c0 reconstructions can be found in [22, 23].\n\n3.2\n\nDouble-charm Analysis for \u039bc Decay Modes\n\nThe double-charm search began with the sample of 1630 \u039b+\nc events (cud) used in the lifetime\nanalysis. We ask for a weak-decay vertex lying between the primary vertex and the observed\n+\n\u2212\n+\n\u039b+\nc decay vertex.

The event topology contains two secondary vertices. In the first, a\n\u2212 +\n\u039b+\nc and a K \u03c0 meson pair are produced. This vertex may be distinguished from the primary\nvertex, if the (ccd) lifetime is sufficiently long. The \u039b+\nc now propagates some distance, and\ndecays at the next vertex. The experiment must identify the two secondary vertices. The idea\nis shown schematically in Fig. 1.\nWe reconstruct total electric charge states Q=1 and Q=2 in separate reconstructions. The\nQ=1 sample consists of two oppositely-charged tracks along with a \u039b+\nc . The Q=2 sample\n+\nconsists of a positively-charged triplet along with the \u039bc . Because the meson-pair tracks from\nthe intermediate vertex may have energies below the RICH detection threshold (25 GeV/c\nfor pions), or since they miss the RICH when they are emitted at wide angles, few achieve\n\u2212 +\nparticle identification in the RICH. To be consistent with a ccd \u2192 \u039b+\nfinal state, the\nc K \u03c0\nnegative track should be a Kaon. We build \"right-sign\" and \"wrong-sign\" samples, based on\ncalling the negative track a Kaon or a pion, respectively.\nEvent selection cuts used here were taken without change from previous single-charm\nstudies. For short-lived states, L1 /\u03c31 \u2265 1 and the \u039b+\nc momentum vector must point back\nto the primary vertex within a \u03c72 cut. We have varied the cuts and observe that no signal\nsignificance depends critically on any cut value. The signals seen here are stable.\n3.2.1\n\nQ = 1 reconstruction, 3520 MeV/c2\n\nFig. 2. shows the K\u2212 \u03c0 + \u039b+\nc mass distribution for single-charged baryons.

The general agreement between right-sign (negative track is Kaon) and wrongsign (negative track is pion) average levels and fluctuations in Fig. 2 confirms that most events\nare combinatoric background. The signal channel shows a 22-event excess over a background\nof 6.1 \u00b1 0.51 events, for a single-bin significance of 6.3 \u03c3. Treating this with gaussian statistics,\nthe probability of such an excess is less than 10\u22128 for a single bin. We searched for a peak in\nthe interval 3.2-4.3 GeV/c2 , or 110 bins. In each bin there is a Poisson-distributed number\nof events along with a Gaussian fluctuation on the background. Summing these effects gives\nthe overall probability that our search would find such a fluctuation anywhere in the search\ninterval of less than 10\u22124 .\nWe calculated the lifetime likelihood for signal and sideband regions in reduced proper\ntime t\u2217 = M(L \u2212 Lmin )/pc for several different lifetime values. In this analysis Lmin = \u03c31 , the\nerror on the vertex separation L1 in the schematic from Fig. 1. From SELEX single-charm\nlifetime studies, we know the lifetime resolution is about 20 fs. Here, the sidebands show a\nlifetime of 30+18\n\u221212 fs. The signal region result is shorter, with lifetime less than 30 fs at 90%\nconfidence. These two results are, of course, statistically consistent with a common short\nlifetime for signal and sideband regions.\n3.2.2\n\nQ=2 Reconstruction, 3460 MeV/c2\n\n2\n2\nFig. 3 shows a \u039e++\ncc candidate at 3460 MeV/c . The peak is narrow, 6 \u00b1 1 MeV/c , matching\nour simulation width. The final state meets the double-charm Cabibbo-favored criteria: final\nstate single charm, final state baryon, final state K\u2212 . The Q=2 sample distribution is quite\ndifferent from that for Q=1. The kinematic threshold for this channel opens near 3.0 GeV/c2 ,\nyet we have only 2 events below the 3460 mass peak. The background under the peak is clearly\nPoisson-distributed. Making a likelihood fit to a linear background function, we find 9 events\nin the peak, compared to an expected background of 1.6 events. The Poisson probability that\nthere is an excess of 7.4 events or more is 5 x 10\u22125 . This search looked for an isospin partner\n2\nto the \u039e+\ncc (3520) and was limited to the range 3.3-3.6 GeV/c , containing 13 bins of width\n\n6\n\n\f12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n+ - + +\n\n\u039bc K \u03c0 \u03c0\nData\n\n2\n\nMean 3780 MeV/c\n2\nSigma 26 MeV/c\nsignal/\u221a(back)\n31/\u221a(31) = 5.6\u03c3\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n3.6\n\n3.7\n\n3.8\n\n3.9\n\n4\n\n\u2212 + + +\n2\nFigure 4: \u039e++\ncc \u2192 K \u03c0 \u03c0 \u039bc mass distribution in 7.5 MeV/c bins.

The probability for a statistical fluctuation up to a 7.4-event excess in any of\nthese 13 bins is less than 7 x 10\u22124 .\nThere are too few events to attempt a lifetime analysis, either for signal or background.\nWe have compared the rest-frame angular decay variables to a phase-space simulation. The\ncomparison is good for the signal region. The background tends to be more peaked along the\nflight direction of the candidate, as one might expect for accidental reconstructions.\n+\nOne can ask why there are so few \u039e++\ncc candidates compared to \u039ecc (3520) candidates.\nSimulation shows that the acceptance is substantially lower for the Q=2 system at masses\nbelow 3500 MeV/c2 than for a corresponding Q=1 system. The SELEX spectrometer cuts off\nthe slow pion acceptance from the higher-multiplicity state. This can be seen in the data by\nthe presence of low-mass background in Fig. 2 and its absence in Fig. 3.\n3.2.3\n\nQ=2 Reconstruction, 3780 MeV/c2\n\n\u2212 + +\n++\nWe also searched at higher mass for \u039b+\nc K \u03c0 \u03c0 decay of \u039ecc (ccu) [24]. We have evidence\n++\n2\n[26] for a \u039ecc ccu baryon near 3780 MeV/c , a state which may be an excited DCB \u039e++\ncc\n(ccu*). The data are shown in Fig. 4, with a linear fit to the background. Other fits are\npossible, with higher background levels, as in Fig. 5. The background curves are determined\nfrom the spectrum itself, from background simulation studies, and taking into account also\nthe wrong-sign mass plot. The higher background in Fig. 5 is based on a simulation study,\nwhich shows that the excess near 3660 MeV may be due to combinatorial background of a\nreal ccd with a \u03c0 + from the primary vertex. This leads us to fit from 3650 MeV, to account\nfor this effect. The number of signal events drops, the background increases, and the signal\nsignificance drops from 5.6\u03c3 to 4.0\u03c3. The width of the peak is roughly three times wider than\nthe low lying DCB peaks, which would be possible for a state which decays strongly. For this\nccu* however, the data do not have a plausible explanation, in that roughly 50% of the signal\n\u2212 + +\n+ +\nevents above background decay weakly (to \u039b+\nc K \u03c0 \u03c0 ) and 50% decay strongly (to \u03c0 \u039ecc ).\nThis is not possible for a single state. We can not now draw unambiguous conclusions.

The mean pt is 1 GeV/c and mean xF \u223c\n0.33. This value of xF is significantly higher than the value xF \u2248 0.10 that one expects [1] if\nthe (ccd) is produced near threshold in a central collision.\n++\nWe compared production of the \u039e+\nstates by different beam hadrons. The\ncc and \u039ecc\nDCBs we see are produced solely by the baryon beams in SELEX data. There are no signal\ncandidates from the pion beam. We also checked if there is a dependence on the target nucleus.\nWe found [24] that the diamond/copper ratio of the signal events is similar to the sideband\nevents, which in turn behave like single-charm production.\nCount rate estimates for DCBs at were given previously [1] based on ccq cross section of\nat most 25 nb per nucleon (25 nb/N). This value is based on a reduction factor of 1000 per\nproduced charm quark, considering that the open charm production cross section (25\u03bcb/N)\nis 1000 times lower than the total inelastic cross section 25 mb/N. But SELEX DCB cross\nsections are several orders of magnitude higher, as approximately 60 DCBs are observed in a\nsample of 1630 \u039bc . Simulation studies suggest that the double-charm states may account for\nas much as 40% of the \u039b+\nc sample seen in this experiment, a surprisingly high fraction. Work\nis in progress to calibrate the SELEX trigger efficiency factor, in order to fix the absolute\nvalue of the DCB cross sections. The high DCB cross section is reminiscent of the discovery\nof the \u039e+\nc baryon in the WA62 experiment at CERN, using a 135 GeV/c hyperon beam [27].\nThat cross section was also anomalously large and still has no good theoretical explanation.\nThe FOCUS photoproduction experiment at Fermilab has looked for these states using their\n\u039b+\nc events. They see very few candidate events and no signal peaks [28].\n\n8\n\n\f+\n\n\u039bc K \u03c0 \u03c0\n-\n\n+\n\n+\n\n4\n\n3.5\n\nRIGHT-SIGN\n\ncos(\u03b8K*) > -.6\n\nWRONG-SIGN\n\ncos(\u03b8K*) > -.6\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n3.3\n\n3.35\n\n3.4\n\n3.45\n\n3.5\n\n3.55\n\n3.6\n\n\u2212 + + +\n2\nFigure 6: \u039e++\ncc \u2192 K \u03c0 \u03c0 \u039bc mass distribution in 7.5 MeV/c bins, with angle cut.

Wrong-sign background is shown as open histogram boxes.\n\n3.4\n\nBackground Reduction Studies for \u039bc Decay Channels\n\nThe cleanest SELEX DCB data are for ccd and ccu lowest peaks, while for ccu* the backgrounds are significant. Consider the ccu at 3460 MeV. Events outside the signal region show\na strong preference for the center-of-mass (CM) angle of the negative track to be near 180\ndegrees, where the angle is with respect to the \u039b+\nc direction. This suggests that these tracks\nrepresent accidental overlaps of a low energy primary track and a real secondary vertex. In\nthe CM system, a low energy primary track is interpreted as a back-angle track from the\nsecondary vertex.\nSimulation indicates that a cut to remove such events should have little effect on the signal\nregion for a phase-space distribution. That is indeed the case in the data. For the ccu at 3460\n\u2217\nMeV, with a cut cos(\u03b8K\n) > \u2212.6, we obtain 1 background and 8 signal events. The spectrum is\nshown in Fig. 6. This angle cut gives result cleaner than without the angle cut, where we had\npreviously 1.6 background and 7.4 signal events. Without this cut, the Poisson probability\nthat there is an excess of 7.4 events in any of the 13 bins between 3.3-3.6 GeV/c2 is less than\n7 x 10\u22124 , and the signal significance is 5.8 \u03c3. With this cut, the Poisson probability that there\nis an excess of 8 events in any of these 13 bins is reduced to 10\u22125 , and the signal significance is\n7.9 \u03c3. We will make similar studies for the ccu* data. The CM angle cut does affect the ccu*\nregion strongly, but not in a way that is simple to understand. For ccu, ccu*, SELEX studies\nto what extent the decay angular distribution of the K\u2212 in the rest frame of the K\u2212 \u03c0 + \u039b+\nc\nsystem is compatible with a phase-space simulation, both for signal and for background. With\nfurther simulations, SELEX will try to better understand such experimental distributions, and\nwill explore other methods of reducing the backgrounds.\n\n3.5\n\nSearch for double-charm baryons in D-meson decay modes\n\nSELEX started complementary DCB data analysis of these same states based on our independent data for D-meson decays. Some possible decay modes of interest are: (D + K \u2212 p), (D 0 K\u0304 0 p)\n9\n\n\ffor (ccd); (D + \u039b\u03c0 + ), (D 0 \u039b\u03c0 + \u03c0 + ), (D + K\u0304 0 p), (D \u2217+ \u039b\u03c0 + ), (D + K \u2212 p\u03c0 + ), for (ccu). This work is\nin progress.\n\n4\n\nPlanning for the CERN COMPASS experiment\n\nThe SELEX efforts will help in the planning of a future state-of-the-art double charm measurement via the CERN COMPASS experiment, and elsewhere. The Sept. 2002 COMPASSFuture meeting at CERN included already a presentation of SELEX data, and initial COMPASS plans in response to consultations with SELEX on the SELEX DCB data [30]. Based on\nthe SELEX results, one could expect from COMPASS [1, 30] up to 10,000 reconstructed DCBs\nfor a 100 day run. The SELEX data have stimulated more detailed plans/prospects/efforts\nat COMPASS to study DCB and even triply charmed baryon spectroscopy.\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nWe reviewed DCB theory. We presented SELEX data for two statistically-compelling new\n\u2212\nhigh-mass states that decay into a final state \u039b+\nand one or two \u03c0 + , as expected for\nc , K\n2\ndouble-charm baryon decays. The 3520 MeV/c state satisfies all expectations for being a\n\u039e+\ncc state. Its mass is compatible with most model calculations for the double-charm baryon\nground state. Its lifetime is shorter than 30 fs at 90% confidence. The 3460 MeV/c2 state\nhas the decay characteristics of a \u039e++\ncc state. However, it is difficult to understand the 60\nMeV/c2 mass difference between the Q=1 and Q=2 states if they are members of the ground\nstate isodoublet. We have not yet tried to confirm that J = 1/2 for both states. We also\n2\nshowed evidence [26] for a \u039e++\ncc (ccu) baryon near 3780 MeV/c , a high mass state decaying\n\u2212 + +\n++\nto \u039b+\nc K \u03c0 \u03c0 , which may be a decay mode of an excited DCB \u039ecc (ccu*). The SELEX data\nhave been used already in the planning of the CERN COMPASS DCB experiment. Internet\nlinks to SELEX and COMPASS DCB presentations are given in Ref. [31].\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are indebted to the staff of Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory and for invaluable technical support from the staffs of collaborating institutions.
