INTRODUCTION\n\nThe bounds on the anomalous magnetic moment of the \u03c4 lepton, a\u03c4 are much weaker than\nthe ones for electron and muon. Due to the \u03c4 lepton's short lifetime of (291.0 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10\u221215\nseg, its anomalous magnetic moment can not be measured by a spin precession method and\nno direct measurement of a\u03c4 exists so far. Because of the impossibility of measuring a\u03c4\nby spin precession method, the present bounds have been obtained by analysis of collision\nexperiments. In that sense, interesting articles, which obtain bounds on a\u03c4 , have been\npublished recently. The OPAL Collaboration [1] uses a reaction proposed for A. Mendez\nand A. Grifolds [2] some years ago. They obtained limits on a\u03c4 from the non-observation of\nanomalous \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 \u03b3 production at LEP. In other article, G.A.Gonzales-Sprinberg, A.Santamaria\nand J.Vidal using LEP1, SLD, and LEP2 data, for tau lepton production, and data from\nCDF, D0 and LEP2, for W-decays into tau lepton, established model independent limits on\nno-standard electromagnetic and weak magnetic moments of the tau lepton [3]. In this case\nthe obtained electromagnetic bound is | a\u03c4 |< 0.009 at 95% C.L., which is the best bound\nobtained today but still far away of the theoretical precision for a\u03c4 :(1177.3 \u00b1 0.3) \u00d7 10\u22126 .\nThis weakness of the a\u03c4 bounds is unfortunate since large deviations from the S.M. values\nare expected for the \u03c4 lepton. In particular, in composite models one would expect larger\neffects for the tau lepton than for the rest of the leptons. In this article we are interested\nin studying the capability of an \u03b3\u03b3 collider to improve the existing bounds on a\u03c4 . In this\nrespect we study the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 process which was studied in the past for different authors\n[4]. It is an extremely clean process because it has not interference with weak interactions,\nbeing a purely QED process. Moreover, the high center of mass energies proposed for this\ncollider makes of it an adequate laboratory to see anomalous magnetic moment effects which\ngrow with the energy. In this work, we analyze a different set of observables than the ones\npreviously studied by other authors [4]. In particular, we analyze the angular distribution\nfor the universality ratio and asymmetries in the production of polarized \u03c4 when the initial\nphotons are polarized too. As far as we know this observable set has not been analyzed yet.\nFollowing Ref [5], in order to analyze tau magnetic moments, we will use an effective\nlagrangian description. Thus, in section 2, we describe the effective lagrangian formalism. In\nsection 3, we summary the helicity formalism, which is used for calculating the cross-section.\nIn the same section we present the different used observable. Finally, in section 4 we give\nour conclusions.\n\nII. THE EFFECTIVE LAGRANGIAN APPROACH\n\nIn the last few years, effective lagrangians have been used as an adequate framework to\nstudy low energies effects of physics beyond the standard model (SM). Since the SM gives\na very good description of all physics at energies available at present accelerators, then one\nexpects that any deviation of the SM can be parametrized by an effective lagrangian built\nwith the field and symmetries of the SM. In this conditions, the effective lagrangian contains a\nrenormalizable piece, the SM theory and non-renormalizable operators of dimension higher\n1\n\n\fthan 4 which are suppresed by inverse powers of the high energy physics scale, \u039b. The\nleading non-standard effects will come from the operators with the lowest dimension. Those\nare dimension six operators. In particular, there are only two six-dimension operators which\ncontribute to the anomalous magnetic moments [6]:\ng\u2032\nL\u0304L \u03c6\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c4R B \u03bc\u03bd\n2\u039b2\ng\n\u2212\n\u2192\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2192\n\u2212\nL\u0304\n\u03c4\n\u03c6\u03c3\n\u03c4\nW\n=\nL\n\u03bc\u03bd\nR\n2\u039b2\n\nOB =\nOW\n\n(1)\n\nwhere LL = (\u03bdL , \u03c4L ) is the tau leptonic doublet and \u03c6 is the Higgs doublet. B \u03bc\u03bd and\nW \u03bc\u03bd are the U(1)Y and SU(2)L field strength tensor, and g \u2032 and g are the corresponding\ngauge couplings. Thus, we write our effective Lagrangian as\nLef f = LSM + \u03b1B OB + \u03b1W OW + h.c.\n\n(2)\n\nAs we are not interested in studying CP violation effects, then we will take the coupling\n\u03b1B and \u03b1W real. Moreover, we will consider them as free parameters without any further\nassumption.\nThe interaction lagrangian can be written in term of the physical fields A\u03bc , Z\u03bc and W\u03bc\u00b1 .\nIn our particular case, we are only interested in the effective electromagnetic interaction,\nsince we are studying a process which only involves electromagnetic interactions. In this\nconditions the relevant lagrangians is\nLef f = LSM + a\u03c4\n\ne\n\u03c4\u0304 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd \u03c4 F \u03bc\u03bd + * * *\n4m\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the dots represent non-relevant pieces of the lagrangian and F\u03bc\u03bd is the electromagnetic field strength tensor. We have expressed the coupling in function of a\u03c4 because\nit is directly related to the experimental measurement and theoretical calculations. The a\u03c4\nconstant can be expressed in terms of \u03b1B , \u03b1W and \u039b as follows\n\u221a\n2vm\u03c4\na\u03c4 =\n(\u03b1B \u2212 \u03b1W )\n(4)\n\u039b2\n\nIII. THE \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 PROCESS\n\nIn this section we study the \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 process which only involves electromagnetic interactions plus additional magnetic moment couplings given by eq(3).\nThis process is of interest for a number of reasons. Increased cross section for high energy\nand the absence of weak contributions are further complementary features of the two-photon\n2\n\n\fprocess. In addition, very hard photons at high luminosity may be produced in Compton\nbackscattering of laser light of high energy e+ e\u2212 beams.\nThe corresponding Feynman diagrams are shown in Fig.1 and the corresponding amplitude for the process can be written as:\nM = \u2212ie2 [P\u03c4 (p1 \u2212 k1 )T1 + P\u03c4 (p1 \u2212 k2 )T2 ]\nwhere P\u03c4 (k) = 1/(k 2 \u2212 m2\u03c4 ) and\nT1 = \u016b(p1 )(\u03b3\u03bc \u2212 i\n\n(5)\n\na\u03c4\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03b4 k1\u03b4 )(p/1 \u2212 k/1 )\n2m\u03c4\n\na\u03c4\n\u03c3\u03bd\u03c1 k2\u03c1 )v(p2 )\u01eb\u03bc1 \u01eb\u03bd2\n2m\u03c4\na\u03c4\nT2 = \u016b(p1 )(\u03b3\u03bd \u2212 i\n\u03c3\u03bd\u03c1 k2\u03c1 )(p/1 \u2212 k/2 )\n2m\u03c4\na\u03c4\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03b4 k1\u03b4 )v(p2 )\u01eb\u03bc1 \u01eb\u03bd2\n(\u03b3\u03bc \u2212 i\n2m\u03c4\n(\u03b3\u03bd \u2212 i\n\n(6)\n\nBounds on the anomalous coupling a\u03c4 can be obtained from a test of universality in\n\u03b3\u03b3-colliders by assuming that only the tau lepton has anomalous magnetic moment (muon\nand electron magnetic moments have been measured quite precisely [7]).\nIn order to compare with the experimental data, we define the angular dependent universality ratio for unpolarized initial photon and final lepton:\nR(\u03b8) =\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9|(\u03b3\u03b3\u2192\u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 )\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9|(\u03b3\u03b3\u2192\u03bc\u03bc\u0304)\n\n(7)\n\nThis ratio is a function of the dispersion angle and the tau lepton anomalous magnetic\nmoment, a\u03c4 . We have considered final lepton as massless. In this conditions the above ratio\ncan be written as\nR(\u03b8) \u2243 1 + \u03b4R(\u03b8, a\u03c4 )\n\n(8)\n\nwhere\n\u03b4R(\u03b8, a\u03c4 ) = 4c2\u03c4 s\n\ni\nsin2 (\u03b8) h\n2\n2\n4\n+\nc\ns\nsin\n(\u03b8)\n\u03c4\n1 + cos2 (\u03b8)\n\n(9)\n\nFor simplicity in the calculation we have used the related constant c\u03c4 = a\u03c4 /(4m\u03c4 ). We\nillustrate the behaviour of \u03b4R as a function of a\u03c4 and\n\u221a \u03b8, showing in Fig.2 the contour plot\nfor different values of \u03b4R in the (cos \u03b8,a\u03c4 ) plane for s = 200 GeV. As it is shown in this\nfigure the maximal sensibility of this observable is reached for \u03b8 closed to \u03c0/2.\n3\n\n\fAnother way to present the same results\nis shown in Fig.3, where we plot R as a function\n\u221a\nof cos \u03b8 for different values of a\u03c4 , for s = 200 GeV. If the tau lepton is a sequential lepton\nwith the same properties of the electron and muon, then we expect an R = 1 value. In the\nother hand, if effects of new physics were relevant for the tau lepton, then we would expect\na different value of R. For example, we consider a measurement of R compatible with one\n< 0.003\n(the\u221aSM value) within a accuracy of 10%, then we could obtain an a\u03c4 bound of a\u03c4 \u223c\nfor s = 200 GeV.\nThe Photon Linear Collider may be the best alternative to the electron-positron collider.\nIn this collider we have the opportunity to control the initial photon polarization by the\ninverse Compton scattering of the polarized laser by the electron-positron beam at NLC\n[8,9]. Adjusting the laser polarization, we can get highly polarized photon. We discuss only\nthe case of circular polarized beam. In this conditions, we study the process \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 \u03c4 \u03c4\u0304 for the\npolarized tau lepton pair production from circular polarized photon collision (\u03b3L,R \u03b3L,R \u2192\n\u03c4L,R \u03c4\u0304L,R ) in the center-mass (CM) frame at tree level in perturbation theory. Due to the\nhigh CM energies involved, we can consider the final lepton as massless. The polarization\nof the final tau (anti-tau) can be studied by their decay products. They are referred to as\nthe spin analyzer of the tau lepton. Effectively, the spin polarization of the produced tau is\nreflected in the distorted distribution of the decay products. Therefore, the \u03c4 -polarization\ncan be determined from a measurement of the spectrum of the final charged particle in the\n\u2212\n\u2212\nfollowing decay channels: \u03c4 \u2212 \u2192 \u03bd\u03c4 \u03c0 \u2212 ,\u03bd\u03c4 \u03c1\u2212 ,\u03bd\u03c4 a\u2212\n1 ,\u03bd\u03c4 e \u03bd\u0304e ,\u03bd\u03c4 \u03bc \u03bd\u0304\u03bc .\nIn order to simplify the calculation of the cross-section when the initial photons and the\nfinal tau pairs are polarized we use the Helicity Amplitude Method (HAM). In this section\nwe summarize the principal features of this method.\nIn order to calculate these amplitudes we follow the rules from helicity formalism and\nuse identities of the type\n{\u016b\u03bb(p1 )\u03b3 \u03bc u\u03bb (p2 )}\u03b3\u03bc = 2u\u03bb(p2 )\u016b\u03bb(p1 ) +\n2u\u2212\u03bb(p1 )\u016b\u2212\u03bb (p2 ),\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is in fact the so called Chisholm identity, and\np/ = u\u03bb (p)\u016b\u03bb (p) + u\u2212\u03bb(p)\u016b\u2212\u03bb (p),\n\n(11)\n\ndefined as a sum of the two projections u\u03bb (p)\u016b\u03bb(p) and u\u2212\u03bb (p)\u016b\u2212\u03bb (p).\nThe spinor products are given by\ns(pi , pj ) \u2261 \u016b+ (pi )u\u2212 (pj ) = \u2212s(pj , pi ),\nt(pi , pj ) \u2261 \u016b\u2212 (pi )u+ (pj ) = [s(pj , pi )]\u2217 .\n\n(12)\n\nUsing the above rules, which are proved in Ref. [10], we can reduce many amplitudes to\nexpressions involving only spinor products.\n4\n\n\fFor the\nof the initial photon we take [10] \u01eb\u03bc\u03bb (k) = N \u016b\u03bb (k)\u03b3 \u03bc u\u03bb (p), where\n\u221a polarization\nN = 1/ 4k.p and p\u03bc is any lightlike vector not collinear to k \u03bc . We take for p\u03bc one of the\nother momenta occurring in the problem. In particular we take p = p1 , where p1 is the\n4-moment of the tau lepton.\nFor simplicity in the expressions and in the numerical calculation we assign a number\nfor each 4-moment as it is shown in Fig.1. In this conditions, we represent the products\ns(pi , pj ) and t(pi , pj ) with the symbols sij and tij respectively. The corresponding amplitude\nare written as functions of these symbols:\nT1 (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) = \u22124f1 f2 s13 s34 t12 t13\nT1 (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 1) = 4f1 f2 s13 s24 t213 (\u22121 + 4c2\u03c4 s23 t23 )\nT1 (\u22121, 1, \u22121, \u22121) = 8f1 f2 c\u03c4 s13 s23 t12 t13 t24\nT1 (\u22121, 1, \u22121, 1) = \u22128f1 f2 c\u03c4 s13 s23 t213 t34\nT1 ( 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121) = \u22128f1 f2 c\u03c4 s213 s34 t13 t23\nT1 ( 1, \u22121, 1, 1) = 8f1 f2 c\u03c4 s12 s13 s24 t13 t23\nT1 ( 1, 1, 1, \u22121) = 4f1 f2 s213 t13 (\u22121 + 4c2\u03c4 s23 t23 )t24\nT1 ( 1, 1, 1, 1) = \u22124f1 f2 s12 s13 t13 t34\nT2 (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121) = 4f1 f2 s23 s34 t12 t23\nT2 (\u22121, \u22121, 1, \u22121) = 4f1 f2 s14 s23 (\u22121 + 4c2\u03c4 s13 t13 )t223\nT2 (\u22121, 1, \u22121, \u22121) = \u22128f1 f2 c\u03c4 s13 s23 t12 t14 t23\nT2 (\u22121, 1, 1, \u22121) = \u22128f1 f2 c\u03c4 s13 s23 t223 t34\nT2 ( 1, \u22121, \u22121, 1) = \u22128f1 f2 c\u03c4 s223 s34 t13 t23\nT2 ( 1, \u22121, 1, 1) = \u22128f1 f2 c\u03c4 s12 s14 s23 t13 t23\nT2 ( 1, 1, \u22121, 1) = 4f1 f2 s223 (\u22121 + 4c2\u03c4 s13 t13 )t14 t23\nT2 ( 1, 1, 1, 1) = 4f1 f2 s12 s23 t23 t34\n\n(13)\n\nwhere c\u03c4 = a\u03c4 /(4m\u03c4 ) and the arguments of the T functions correspond to the helicities\nof \u03c4 , \u03c4\u0304 and the photons respectively. After the evaluation of the amplitudes for the corresponding diagrams, we obtain the cross-sections of the analyzed processes for each point of\nthe phase space and for different helicity of the particles involved in the process.\nIn this conditions we are ready to study different kinds of observables built with the\ncross-section for polarized particles. The photon, which goes ahead in positive z direction, is\nconsidered polarized left, being z the beam axis. The other initial photon, that goes ahead in\nthe negative z direction, is supposed unpolarized. Thus, we define the following observable\nand we call it Asymmetry\nALR (\u03b8) =\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9|L \u2212 d\u03c3/d\u03a9|R\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9|L + d\u03c3/d\u03a9|R\n\n(14)\n\nwhere d\u03c3/d\u03a9|L(R) is the differential cross-section production for Left (Right) tau. The\nanti-tau is considered unpolarized and the initial state is prepared as we have explained\n5\n\n\fabove. From the general expression for the amplitude is easy to obtain an analytic result\nfor ALR (\u03b8)\nALR (\u03b8) =\n\n\u22122 cos \u03b8 + 4c2\u03c4 s(2 \u2212 cos \u03b8) sin2 \u03b8\n1 + cos2 \u03b8 + 16c2\u03c4 s(1 + c2\u03c4 s sin2 \u03b8/4) sin2 \u03b8\n\n(15)\n\n\u221a\nIn fig.4 and fig.5 we show ALR (\u03b8) for different values of a\u03c4 for s = 200GeV and 500GeV\nrespectively. In particular we plot the curve for a\u03c4 = 0.009 which corresponds to the best\nbound obtained from other authors [3], and the curve for a\u03c4 = 0.001177 that corresponds\nto the theoretical estimation for a\u03c4 . As we can see this asymmetry\nis an observable sensible\n\u221a\nto effects of magnetic anomalous moment. In particular for s = 500 GeV, we can see an\nimportant apartment between the standard prediction (a\u03c4 = 0) and the best present bound\n(a\u03c4 = 0.009). In this respect we define the relative apartment between the asymmetry and\nthe SM-asymmetry (a\u03c4 = 0)\nALR (\u03b8) \u2212 ASM\nLR (\u03b8)\n\u03b4=\n\u00d7 100\n2\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the denominator 2 in the above expression corresponds to the all variation range of\nthe asymmetry. This apartment \u03b4 can be think as related\n\u221a to the experimental\n\u221a precision in\nthe ALR measurement. In fig. 6 and 7 we plot \u03b4 for s = 200GeV and s = 500GeV\nrespectively. We can see a significant apartment for moderate values of a\u03c4 , which makes of\nthis asymmetry a useful observable to bound magnetic anomalous moment.\nFor completeness, we define another related observable involving the total cross-section\nBLR =\n\n\u03c3L \u2212 \u03c3R\n\u03c3L + \u03c3R\n\n(17)\n\nwhere\n\u03c3L(R) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03c3\n|L(R) d\u03a9\nd\u03a9\n\n(18)\n\nFor this observable, it is easy to obtain an analytic expression\nBLR =\n\nc2\u03c4 s\n1/4 + 2c2\u03c4 s + 2/5c4\u03c4 s2\n\n(19)\n\nNote that this observable vanishes in the Standard Model (a\u03c4 = 0). In fig.8 we show it\nas a function of a\u03c4 for 200 GeV and 500 GeV center of masses energies respectively. We\ninclude a vertical line that represent the current best bound for a\u03c4 . As we can see the BLR\nvalues show a significant deviation of the SM value (BLR = 0).\n6\n\n\fIV. CONCLUTION\n\nIn this work we study a set of different observables which were not investigated by another\nauthors previously. These observables involve universality test and polarization effects. We\nhave founded that, by using these observable set, it could be possible to improve the actual\nbounds for a\u03c4 .\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank CONICET (Argentina), Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata (Argentina)\nfor their financial supports.\n\n7\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\nThe OPAL Collaboration, K.
