That is, a\n\"sensible\" world-view, such as that proposed in [3], is unfortunately untenable.\nSo either the objective reality-condition (that things exist in definite\nstates whether we look or not) must be broken, e.g. as in orthodox quantum\nmechanics, or the locality-condition (that events arbitrarily far away cannot\naffect what happens here and now - relativistic separability and causality)\nmust be broken, e.g. as in non-local hidden variable theories. The variables\nare called \"hidden\" because their existence is only conjectured and beyond\nour (present) control, but meant to complete quantum mechanics into a uniform description of micro and macro1 . The first detailed such theory, perfectly deterministic and compatible with all known experimental data, was\n[10]. Notice, however, that we are not necessarily considering any specific existing hidden variable theory, but an \"ultimate\" hidden variable theory that\nin principle decides everything deterministically. In contrast in the orthodox\napproach to quantum mechanics the quantum particles in effect behave as\nparticles when observed and as waves when not observed - thereby, and at the\nmost fundamental level, introducing the ill-defined act of observation (\"measurement problem\", \"collapse of the wave function\", Bohr's \"irreversible act\nof measurement\"), whereas particles in hidden variable theories always behave as particles but are being \"pushed around\" by the underlying (hidden)\ndynamics. In such deterministic systems the present state completely and\nuniquely determines the future, but as is well-known chaotic systems can\n\"impersonate\" randomness due to their extreme sensitivity to initial conditions; in a nutshell chaos is about order and disorder in deterministic systems\nthat are nonlinear.\nSo far, it has not been possible to distinguish between the locality vs.\nreality alternatives, and the choice has been mainly one of personal taste.\nHowever, as hidden variable theories are deterministic (quantum particles behaving as realistic classical particles all the time, encoding Einstein's\n\"elements of physical reality\" [3]) and orthodox quantum mechanics fundamentally probabilistic (each individual event/measurement assumed to be\n1\n\nBell himself was heavily biased towards a hidden variable resolution of the problem\n\n[9].\n\n2\n\n\fcompletely random), it should be possible to experimentally test the distinction between them.\nAn experiment to test this possibility could be devised in analogy to the\nconfirmation of deterministic chaos in a dripping water faucet [11],[12]. It\nis of course well-known that deterministic chaos requires nonlinear systems\nwhereas the Schr\u00f6dinger equation is linear. However, most hidden variable\ntheories like the original by Bohm [10] are manifestly nonlinear2 .\nIf we, for example, replace the dripping faucet with a double-slit experiment3 with individual quantum entities (electrons, neutrons, photons, etc),\nthe effectively one-dimensional position (qi ) of the successive \"hits\" on the\ndetector screen, in effect defining a discrete time-series, can be used to try to\nreconstruct a chaotic attractor, in case the underlying theory is dissipative\n, or a deterministic structure in phase space, in case it is non-dissipative\n(Hamiltonian), by applying a method [13],[14] of converting a single data series into a phase space portrait via \"delay coordinate embedding\". This can\nbe accomplished, assuming a suitably low-dimensional attractor/structure,\nby defining the coordinates as follows\nx = qi ,\n\ny = qi+1 ,\n\nz = qi+2 .\n\n(1)\n\nA given i then gives a point, (x, y, z), in phase space.\nTo give an elementary example, the seemingly random data in Fig.1 is\nreally due to the deceptively simple, but actually incredibly rich, \"logistic\nmapping\"\nxn+1 = k xn (1 \u2212 xn ),\n(2)\nin its highly chaotic regime with k = 4 [15].\nThe reconstructed attractor, using the method described above, is seen\nin Fig.2 (2-D) and in Fig.3 (3-D).\nWe do not, however, expect that an eventual attractor/structure in real\nquantum mechanical data will be so simple and low-dimensional, even though\nthe logistic mapping has been shown to be in qualitative and quantitative\n2\n\nAs an aside, if hidden variables is the correct way to explain the violation of Bell's\ninequality this could make true quantum chaos possible, as opposed to the usual notion of\n\"quantum chaos\" which is concerned with quantum signatures of corresponding systems\nknown to be chaotic in the classical case, as the linear structure of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nalone does not support true chaos.\n3\nAccording to R.P. Feynman the double slit experiment \"...has in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the only mystery.\", The Feynman Lectures on\nPhysics, Vol.III, p. 1-1.\n\n3\n\n\fx\n\nn\n\nFigure 1: Seemingly random data, actually generated by the simple and\ndeterministic \"logistic mapping\" in its chaotic region, see text, and [15].\nagreement with numerous real-life systems in all branches of science, see e.g.\n[16] for some early examples. This would be very surprising if not for the\nremarkable fact that there exists a \"universality\" in this kind of chaos [17].\nIn a sense, the logistic mapping is just like a model for observing \"random\" hits on an effectively 1D-detector screen of unit length (arbitrarily\ndefined), just like in the double slit experiment. The detector in effect defines a natural Poincar\u00e9 section - a discrete \"stroboscope\" mapping of the\nunit interval onto itself - of the underlying continuous dynamics described\nby differential equations. If there is a deterministic mechanism underlying\nthe \"random\" hits on the screen, creating the known statistical distribution\nafter many hits, it should then show up as a structure in reconstructed phase\nspace.\nIn principle, to capture all emitted quantum particles, the ideal would be\nto have a perfectly efficient 4\u03c0-detector, faithfully recording each individual\nquantum particle on its \"latitude and longitude\". A 2D-iterated mapping,\nof the classic predator-prey kind, would then be a model for the successive\nhits, the simplest one using \"non-overlapping generations\", where each hit\nis described by two coordinates (originally the populations of predator and\nprey species) and is determined by the previous hit through a mapping of\nthe form\nxn+1 = f (xn , yn ), yn+1 = g(xn , yn ).\n(3)\n\n4\n\n\fy\n1\n\n1\n\nx\n\nFigure 2: The reconstructed attractor in 2-D from the data in Fig.1, using Eq.\n(1), showing that its \"randomness\" has its origin in dynamical deterministic\nchaos.\nOne such model, the H\u00e9non mapping [18]\nxn+1 = yn + 1 \u2212 ax2n ,\n\nyn+1 = bxn ,\n\n(4)\n\ngives the famous H\u00e9non-attractor. For the canonical values a = 1.4 and b\n= 0.3 the H\u00e9non map is chaotic; each individual hit appears random, but\na clear structure builds up over time, analogous to hits in the double-slit\nexperiment. In the former case the structure is fractal [19], whereas in the\nlatter case it may or may not be.\nHowever, one could argue that any eventual hidden variables must \"know\"\nthat we have restricted the \"landing platform\" for the quantum particle to\nan effectively 1D-strip, so that additional spatial variables are superfluous.\nThe hidden variables must also keep track of if one or both slits are open\nand relay that information non-locally (faster than the speed of light) to the\ndetector screen, as in [10], to comply with the violation of Bell's inequality.\nAs modern technology has made it possible to trap and observe individual\nquantum objects, such as atoms, it might be better and easier to exploit this\nfact than trying to use the mythical double-slit. Measurements of \"quantum\njumps\" in single atoms [20],[21], and the resulting fluctuation of their fluorescent on/off-states, may make an ideal testing ground where recorded data\nshould already be present (the time-series underlying Fig. 2 in both articles\n[20],[21] could in principle be directly inserted into Eq. (1) above), but only\nimagination limits the list of possible experimental setups.\n5\n\n\f1\n\ny\n\n1\n\nz\n\n0\n\nx\n1\n\nFigure 3: Reconstructed attractor in 3-D from the data in Fig.1, again using\nEq. (1).\nIf the seemingly random florescence gives rise to a distinct structure in\nphase space, with non-integer fractal dimension, onto which the phase space\npoints are concentrated, it would be a clear indication that it is actually\nthe consequence of dynamical deterministic chaos (i.e. hidden variables), in\ndirect analogy to how [11],[12] revealed deterministic chaos in the dynamics\nof the dripping water faucet. For examples of qualitatively typical chaotic\nattractors/structures see, e.g., the figures in [11],[12] or the famous examples\npresented in the figures in this article (accompanied by their respective physical implications to the problem at hand in the figure captions to Figs. 5 and\n7). However, the exact shape, dimension and complexity will be governed by\nthe (unknown) detailed underlying dynamics. The rest of the analysis carries\nthrough just like in [11],[12].\nIn fact, in the present case it is in principle even easier to obtain a conclusive result as any observed structure indicates a deviation from the usual\nassumption of total randomness of quantum mechanics - where it is normally assumed that, e.g., the hit of an individual particle is a completely\n\n6\n\n\findependent and truly random process - even if one has collected one million\nsuccessive data points the next one, according to orthodox quantum mechanics, will be a complete surprise and impossible to predict even in principle,\nsee Fig.4.\n\nFigure 4: When no dynamical relation between the data points (qi ) exists,\nno structure is obtained by the reconstruction mechanism, Eq. (1). This\nwould be the case for \"orthodox\" quantum mechanics where each individual\nhit/result/event is assumed to be completely random. The world could then\nnot be objectively real, but could be local.\nSo, in a perfect world it should be easy to potentially disprove orthodox\nquantum mechanics. A practical problem is of course that there exist no\nperfect particle detectors, which results in missing part of the series and also\nin the introduction of noise in the data. The more of the series one misses, the\nharder it becomes to reconstruct an (eventual) attractor/structure. This may,\nas stated above, be circumvented by observing, e.g., single atoms exhibiting\nquantum jumps as this \"...can be detected with unity quantum efficiency\"\n[20].\nIf, however, no attractor/structure is found in the experimental data, i.e.,\n7\n\n\fif the points are scattered randomly in phase space, as in Fig.4, where every qi\nhas been generated at random, then quantum mechanical \"measurements\"\n(e.g., hits on detector screen, timing between on/off-states, etc) probably\ncannot be described by deterministic equations, and some truly stochastic\neffect(s) must instead be at work, e.g. as assumed in orthodox quantum\nmechanics.\nHence, it should be possible to test, and potentially falsify: either the\nhypothesis that quantum randomness is due to underlying deterministic dynamics - hidden variables (in which case the \"randomness\" actually would\nmerely be apparent, not fundamental) - without having to know and penetrate the details of the underlying equations, or the standard fundamentally\nprobabilistic interpretation/postulate of Born as used in orthodox quantum\nmechanics, and hence answer if Nature prefers to break locality or objective\nreality on her fundamental level. In case of the former, it would indicate an\nunexpected and deep hidden connection between the three great revolutions\nof 20th-century science; relativity, quantum mechanics and chaos theory, and\nperhaps even point the way towards a unified complex nonlinear systems theory of the future.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.S.

To mimic the apparently random behavior of quantum mechanical data it will be a \"strange\nattractor\" with non-integer (fractal [19]) dimension analogous to the famous\nLorenz-attractor, here reconstructed from time series data from only one of\nthe three variables of the Lorenz system [22] - the very first concrete example of dissipative chaos. Any apparent attractor structure would tell us\nNature is not local - causes arbitrarily far may affect results \"here\" - i.e.\nthere are influences going faster than light (even if we cannot control them\nfor practical telegraphy). Furthermore, it would indicate that the orthodox\n(\"Copenhagen\") interpretation of quantum mechanics is wrong.\n\n11\n\n\fy\n\nx\n\nFigure 6: \"The Lorenz Map\" - when successive, erratically fluctuating, amplitude maxima were plotted for the Lorenz attractor (previous figure) using\na technique analogous to the one described in this article, the surprising result was this nearly one-dimensional attractor; hidden order in chaos [22],\nand a concrete simple example of the relation between continuous dynamics\nand discrete mappings.\n\n12\n\n\f10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n0\n\n0\n2\n\n2\n4\n\n4\n6\n\n6\n8\n\n8\n10\n\n10\n\nFigure 7: If \"hidden variables\" are governed and determined by nondissipative (Hamiltonian) equations no attractor will result, yet a structure\ndiffering from pure randomness will emerge. Such a result would imply\nthe same conclusion regarding the world as noted in the text accompanying Fig.5. The example shows the modern reconstructed phase space of the\n\"restricted circular three-body problem\" in astronomy [23], where Poincar\u00e9\nfirst glimpsed what today is known as deterministic chaos, non-dissipative\nin this case. This (the corrected and printed version [24]) was his winning\ncontribution (price money: 2,500 Swedish Kronor) to a contest announced\nin 1885 to celebrate the 60th birthday of the Swedish King Oscar II in 1889.\nWhat Poincar\u00e9 found was that small changes in the initial conditions (such as\npositions and initial velocities of planets) produced huge and unpredictable\noutcomes - deterministic chaos in today's parlance.\n\n13\n\n\f"}
