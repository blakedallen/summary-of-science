The description\nis provided by solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity which interpolate smoothly\nbetween a special holonomy manifold and an event horizon with Anti-de Sitter geometry. For known examples of Anti-de Sitter solutions, the associated special holonomy\nmetric is derived. One explicit Anti-de Sitter solution of M-theory is so treated for\nfivebranes wrapping each of the following cycles: K\u00e4hler cycles in Calabi-Yau two, three- and four-folds; special lagrangian cycles in three- and four-folds; associative\nthree- and co-associative four-cycles in G2 manifolds; complex lagrangian four-cycles\nin Sp(2) manifolds; and Cayley four-cycles in Spin(7) manifolds. In each case, the associated special holonomy metric is singular, and is a hyperbolic analogue of a known\nmetric. The analogous known metrics are respectively: Eguchi-Hanson, the resolved\nconifold and the four-fold resolved conifold; the deformed conifold, and the Stenzel\nfour-fold metric; the Bryant-Salamon-Gibbons-Page-Pope G2 metrics on an R4 bundle\nover S 3 , and an R3 bundle over S 4 or CP2 ; the Calabi hyper-K\u00e4hler metric on T \u2217 CP2 ;\nand the Bryant-Salamon-Gibbons-Page-Pope Spin(7) metric on an R4 bundle over S 4 .\nBy the AdS/CFT correspondence, a conformal field theory is associated to each of the\nnew singular special holonomy metrics, and defines the quantum gravitational physics\nof the resolution of their singularities.\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence [1] provides a conceptual framework for consistently encoding the\ngeometry of Anti-de Sitter and special holonomy solutions of M-/string theory in a quantum theory.\nThough the class of spacetimes to which it can be applied is restricted, and unfortunately does not\ninclude FLRW cosmologies, it provides the only complete proposal extant for the definition of a\nquantum theory of gravity. For the prototypical example of AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 /R10 and N = 4 super YangMills, the Maldacena conjecture is by now approaching the status of proof [2], [3]. The literature\non the correspondence is enormous, from applications in pure mathematics to phenomenological\n\ninvestigations. On the phenomenological front, much effort has been devoted to extending the\nAdS/CFT correspondence from N = 4 super Yang-Mills to more realistic field theories [4] and\n\neven QCD itself [5], [6]. Also, recent developments have raised the hope that we may soon be\nable to use AdS/CFT to test M-/string theory in the lab [7]-[10]. On the mathematical front, the\nmotivation provided by the AdS/CFT correspondence has stimulated spectacular progress in differential geometry; early work on the correspondence showed that there is a deep interplay between\nAnti-de Sitter solutions of M-/string theory, singular special holonomy manifolds and conformal\nfield theories [11], [12]. This relationship has since been the topic of intense investigation; a recent\nhighlight has been the beautiful work on Sasaki-Einstein geometry, toric Calabi-Yau three-folds and\nthe associated conformal field theories [13]-[19]. What has become clear is that the geometry of a\nsupersymmetric AdS/CFT dual involves an Anti-de Sitter manifold, a singular special holonomy\nmanifold1 and a supergravity solution which, in a sense that will be made more precise, interpolates smoothly between them. This geometrical relationship, between Anti-de Sitter manifolds and\nsingular special holonomy manifolds, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence in M-theory,\nis the subject of this paper.\nThe canonical example of this relationship, from IIB, is that between conically singular Calabi-\n\nYau three-folds and Sasaki-Einstein AdS5 solutions of IIB supergravity. Each of these geometries,\nindividually, is a supersymmetric solution of IIB, preserving eight supercharges. Furthermore, the\nmanifolds may be superimposed2 to obtain another supersymmetric solution of IIB, admitting four\nsupersymmetries. This interpolating solution - the supergravity description of D3 branes at a\nconical Calabi-Yau singularity - has metric\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\u00131/2 \u0010\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0011\nB\nB\n2\n1,3\ndr 2 + r 2 ds2 (SE5 ) ,\nds (R ) + A + 4\nds = A + 4\nr\nr\n2\n\n(1.1)\n\nfor constants A, B and a Sasaki-Einstein five-metric ds2 (SE5 ). Setting B=0 gives the IIB solution\nR1,3 \u00d7 CY3 , while setting A=0 gives the solution AdS5 \u00d7 SE5 . For positive A, B, the solution\n1\n2\n\nWith the obviously special non-singular exception of flat space.\nBecause, with a suitable ansatz including both, the supergravity field equations linearise.\n\n1\n\n\fis globally smooth, and contains two distinct asymptotic regions: a spacelike infinity where the\nmetric asymptotes to that of the Calabi-Yau, and an internal spacelike infinity, where the metric\nasymptotes to that of the Anti-de Sitter, on an event horizon at infinite proper distance. The causal\nstructure of these solutions is discussed in detail in [20]. The Calabi-Yau singularity is excised in the\ninterpolating solution, and removed to infinity; an important feature of the interpolating solution\nis that it admits a globally-defined SU(3) structure.\nThe AdS/CFT correspondence tells us how to perform this geometrical interpolation in a quantum framework. Open string theory on the singular Calabi-Yau reduces, at low energies, to a\nconformally invariant quiver gauge theory, at weak 't Hooft coupling. This is the low-energy effective field theory on the world-volume of a stack of probe D3 branes located at the singularity. The\ngauge theory encodes the toric data of the Calabi-Yau. The same quiver gauge theory, at strong 't\nHooft coupling, is identical to IIB string theory on the AdS5 \u00d7 SE5 ; by the AdS/CFT dictionary,\n\nthe CFT also encodes the Sasaki-Einstein data of the AdS solution. Clearly, it can only do this for\nboth the Calabi-Yau and the AdS5 if their geometry is intimately related. In the classical regime,\n\nthis relationship is provided by the interpolating solution. In the quantum regime, the relationship\nis provided by the CFT itself; the interpolation parameter is the 't Hooft coupling. In effect, the\nCFT is telling us how to cut out the Calabi-Yau singularity quantum gravitationally, and replace\nit with an event horizon with the geometry of Anti-de Sitter.\nThe correspondence is best understood for branes at conical singularities of special holonomy\nmanifolds. However, starting from the work of Maldacena and Nu\u00f1ez [21], many supersymmetric\nAdS solutions of M-/string theory have been discovered,[22]-[29], [13], which cannot be interpreted\nas coming from a stack of branes at a conical singularity. Instead, they have been interpreted as the\nnear-horizon limits of the supergravity description of branes wrapped on calibrated cyles of special\nholonomy manifolds. The CFT dual of the AdS/special holonomy manifolds is the low-energy\neffective theory on the unwrapped worldvolume directions of the branes. A brane, heuristically\nenvisioned as a hypersurface in spacetime, can wrap a calibrated cycle in a special holonomy manifold, while preserving supersymmetry. A heuristic physical argument as to why this is possible is\nthat a calibrated cycle is volume-minimising in its homology class; as a probe brane has a tension,\nit will always try to contract, and so a wrapped probe brane is only stable if it wraps a minimal\ncycle. The supergravity description of a stack of wrapped branes, by analogy with that of branes\nat conical singularities, should be a supergravity solution which smoothly interpolates between a\nspecial holonomy manifold with an appropriate calibrated cycle, and an event horizon with Anti-de\nSitter geometry. As the notion of an interpolating solution is central to this paper, a more careful\ndefinition of what is meant by these words will now be given.\n\n2\n\n\fDefinition 1 Let MAdS be a d-dimensional manifold admiting a warped-product AdS metric\ngAdS , that, together with a matter content FAdS , gives a supersymmetric solution of a supergravity\ntheory in d dimensions. Let MSH be a d-dimensional manifold admitting a special holonomy\n\nmetric gSH , which gives a supersymmetric vacuum solution of the supergravity with holonomy\nG \u2282 Spin(d \u2212 1). Let MI be a d-dimensional manifold admitting a globally-defined G-structure,\n\ntogether with a metric gI and a matter content FI that give a supersymmetric solution of the\nsupergravity. Then we say that (MI , gI , FI ) is an interpolating solution if for all \u01eb, \u03b6 > 0, there\n\nexist open sets OAdS \u2282 MAdS , OI , OI\u2032 \u2282 MI , OSH \u2282 MSH , such that for all points pAdS \u2208 OAdS ,\npI \u2208 OI , p\u2032I \u2208 OI\u2032 , pSH \u2208 OSH ,\n|gAdS (pAdS ) \u2212 gI (pI )| < \u01eb,\n\n|gSH (pSH ) \u2212 gI (p\u2032I )| < \u03b6.\n\n(1.2)\n\nWe also define the following useful pieces of vocabulary:\nDefinition 2 If for a given pair (MAdS , gAdS , FAdS ), (MSH , gSH , FSH ), there exists an interpolating solution, then we say that MSH is a special holonomy interpolation of MAdS and that\n\nMAdS is an Anti-de Sitter interpolation of MSH . Collectively, we refer to (MAdS , gAdS , FAdS ) and\n(MSH , gSH , FSH ) as an interpolating pair.\nThe objective of this paper is to derive candidate special holonomy interpolations of some of the\nwrapped fivebrane near-horizon limit AdS solutions of [22]-[25]. In [31], candidate special holonomy\ninterpolations of the AdS5 M-theory solutions of [21] were derived. These AdS solutions describe\nthe near-horizon limit of fivebranes wrapped on K\u00e4hler two-cycles in Calabi-Yau two-folds and\nthree-folds. As these results fit nicely into the more extensive picture presented here, they will be\nreviewed briefly below. The new special holonomy metrics that will be derived here are candidate\ninterpolations of: the AdS3 solution of [24], describing the near-horizon limit of fivebranes wrapped\non a K\u00e4hler four-cycle in a four-fold; the AdS4 solution of [23], interpreted in [24] as the nearhorizon limit of fivebranes on a special lagrangian (SLAG) three-cycle in a three-fold; the AdS3\nsolution of [24], for fivebranes on a SLAG four-cycle in a four-fold; the AdS4 solution of [22], for\nfivebranes on an associative three-cycle in a G2 manifold; the AdS3 solution of [24], for fivebranes on\na co-associative four-cycle in a G2 manifold; the AdS3 solution of [25], for fivebranes on a complex\nlagrangian (CLAG) four-cycle in an Sp(2) manifold; and the AdS3 solution of [24], for fivebranes on\na Cayley four-cycle in a Spin(7) manifold. This paper therefore provides one candidate interpolating\npair for every type of cycle on which M-theory fivebranes can wrap, in all manifolds of dimension\nless than ten with irreducible holonomy, with the exception of K\u00e4hler four-cycles in three-folds and\nquaternionic K\u00e4hler four-cycles in Sp(2) manifolds, for which no AdS solutions are known to the\nauthor.\n\n3\n\n\fNo interpolating solutions of eleven-dimensional supergravity which describe wrapped branes\nare known. However, based on various symmetry and supersymmetry arguments, the differential\nequations they satisfy are known, for all types of calibrated cycles in all special holonomy manifolds\nthat play a r\u00f4le in M-theory. These equations will be called the wrapped brane equations; there\nis an extensive literature on their derivation [32]-[41]; the most general results are those of [39][41]. The key point that will be exploited here is that both members of an interpolating pair\nshould individually be a solution of the wrapped brane equations, with a suitable ansatz for the\ninterpolating solution. This is just like what happens for an interpolating solution associated to a\nconical special holonomy manifold.\nOne of the many important results of [13] was to show how any AdS5 solution of M-theory,\ncoming from fivebranes on a K\u00e4hler two-cycle in a three-fold, satisfies the appropriate wrapped\nbrane equations. The canonical frame of the AdS5 solutions, defined by their eight Killing spinors,\nadmits an SU(2) structure. The AdS5 solutions may also be re-written in such a way that the\ncanonical AdS5 frame is obscured, but a canonical R1,3 frame is made manifest. This frame admits\nan SU(3) structure, and is defined by half the Killing spinors of the AdS5 solution. And it is\nthis Minkowski SU(3) structure which satisfies the wrapped brane equations. By definition, any\ninterpolating solution describing fivebranes on a K\u00e4hler two-cycle in a three-fold admits a globallydefined SU(3) structure; this structure smoothly matches on to the SU(3) structure of the CalabiYau and also to the canonical SU(3) structure of the AdS5 solution. This construction has since\nbeen systematically extended to all calibrated cycles in manifolds with irreducible holonomy of\nrelevance to M-theory in [39], [40], [41], and, starting from the wrapped brane equations, has been\nused to classify (ie, derive the differential equation satisfied by) all supersymmetric AdS solutions\nof M-theory which have a wrapped-brane origin.\nThe strategy used here to construct candidate special holonomy interpolations of the AdS solutions is therefore the following. We first construct the canonical Minkowski frames and structures\nof the AdS solutions, which satisfy the appropriate wrapped brane equations. We then use these\nas a guide to formulating a suitable ansatz for an interpolating solution. It is then a (reasonably)\nstraightforward matter to determine the most general special holonomy solution of the AdS-inspired\nansatz for the interpolating solution. In each case, the special holonomy metric thus obtained is\nthe proposed interpolation of the AdS solution. No attempt has been made to determine the interpolating solutions themselves. It is therefore a matter of conjecture whether the special holonomy\nmetrics obtained are indeed interpolations of the AdS solutions. However the results are sufficiently\nstriking that it is reasonable to believe that for the proposed interpolating pairs an interpolating\nsolution does indeed exist.\nAs an illustration of this procedure, consider the results of [31] for the proposed interpolation\nof the N = 2 AdS5 solution of [21], describing the near-horizon limit of fivebranes on a K\u00e4hler\n\n4\n\n\ftwo-cycle in a two-fold. When re-written in the canonical Minkowski frame, the AdS solution is of\nthe form\n\u0011\ni\n\u0010\nh\nh\nF 2 2 i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u22121\n2\n2\n1,3\n2\n\u22121\ndu + u (d\u03c8 \u2212 P ) + dt + t ds (S ) ,\nds = L ds (R ) + ds (H ) + L F\n2\n(1.3)\nwhere3 dP = Vol[H 2 ], the period of \u03c8 is 2\u03c0 and F, L are known functions of the coordinates u and\nt. The ansatz for the interpolating solution is then simply that F, L are allowed to be arbitrary\nfunctions of u, t. The most general special holonomy solution with this ansatz is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,6 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n(1.4)\n\nwhere, up to an overall scale,\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u22121\nR2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds (N\u03c4 ) =\nds (H ) +\n\u2212 1 (d\u03c8 \u2212 P ) +\n\u22121\ndR2 .\n4\nR4\nR4\n\n(1.5)\n\nThe range of R is R \u2208 (0, 1]. At R = 1, an S 2 degenerates smoothly, and a H 2 bolt stabilises. At\nR = 0, the metric is singular, where the K\u00e4hler H 2 cycle degenerates. In the probe-brane picture,\nthe fivebranes should be thought of as wrapping the H 2 at the singularity. Otherwise, they can\nalways decrease their worldvolume by moving to smaller R. This incomplete special holonomy\nmetric is to be compared with the Eguchi-Hanson metric [42], which is\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u22121\n1\n1\nR2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds (S ) + 1 \u2212 4 (d\u03c8 \u2212 P ) + 1 \u2212 4\nds (EH) =\ndR2 ,\n4\nR\nR\n\n(1.6)\n\nwhere now dP = Vol[S 2 ]. As is well known, this metric is complete in the range R \u2208 [1, \u221e). At\n\nR = 1, an S 2 degenerates smoothly and a K\u00e4hler S 2 bolt stabilises.\nIn every case, the conjectured special holonomy interpolations of the AdS solutions derived in\n\nthis paper are singular, and they have exactly the same relationship with known complete special\nholonomy metrics as that of (1.5) with Eguchi-Hanson. To make the pattern clear, it worth quoting\none more example now. The conjectured special holonomy interpolation of the AdS3 solution of\n[24] for fivebranes on a Cayley four-cycle in a Spin(7) manifold is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,2 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere, up to an overall scale,\n36 2\n9\nR\nds (N\u03c4 ) = R2 ds2 (H 4 ) +\n20\n100\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nR10/3\n\n\u0013\n\na\n\na\n\n\u2212 1 DY DY +\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nR10/3\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\ndR2 ,\n\n(1.8)\n\nHere, and throughout, ds2 (AdSn ), ds2 (H n ), ds2 (S n ), denote the maximally symmetric Einstein metrics on ndimensional AdS manifolds, n-hyperboloids or n-spheres with unit radius of curvature, respectively. The cartesian\nmetric on flat space will be denoted by ds2 (Rn ). The volume form on a unit n-hyperboloid or n-sphere will be\ndenoted by Vol[H n ], Vol[S n ], respectively.\n\n5\n\n\fwhere the Y a are constrained coordinates on an S 3 and D will be defined later. The range of R\nis R \u2208 (0, 1]; at R = 1 the S 3 degenerates smoothly and a H 4 bolt stabilises. At R = 0 the\nmetric is singular where the H 4 Cayley four-cycle degenerates. This metric is to be compared with\nthe Spin(7) metric on an R4 bundle over S 4 , first found by Bryant and Salamon [43] and later\nindependently by Gibbons, Page and Pope [44]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n1\n1\n36 2\n9 2 2 4\na\na\n2\nR 1 \u2212 10/3 DY DY + 1 \u2212 10/3\ndR2 ,\n(1.9)\nds (BSGPP) = R ds (S ) +\n20\n100\nR\nR\nThis metric is complete in the range R \u2208 [1, \u221e); at R = 1 an S 4 degenerates smoothly and a\nCayley S 4 bolt stabilises.\nThis relationship with known complete special holonomy metrics is a universal feature of all\nthe proposed special holonomy interpolations of this paper. As this series of incomplete special\nholonomy metrics has so many features in common, they will be given a collective name, the N\u03c4\n\nseries. Though they have been derived here from the AdS M-theory solutions ab initio, they may be\nobtained in a much simpler way a posteriori, by analytic continuation of known complete metrics4 .\n\nIn every case, they may be obtained from a known complete metric with a radial coordinate of semiinfinite range, at the endpoint of which an S m degenerates and a calibrated S n (or, as appropriate,\nCP2 ) cycle stabilises. The N\u03c4 series is obtained by changing the sign of the scalar curvature of\nthe bolt and analytically continuing the dependence of the metric on the radial coordinate. This\ngenerates a special holonomy metric with a \"radial\" coordinate of finite range, with a smoothly\ndegenerating S m and a stabilised H n (or Bergman) bolt at one endpoint, and a singular degeneration\nat the other. For the Calabi-Yau N\u03c4 with K\u00e4hler cycles in three-folds and four-folds, the analogous\nknown metrics are the resolved conifold of [45], [46], and its four-fold analogue (see [47] for useful\nadditional background on the resolved conifold). For the Calabi-Yau N\u03c4 with SLAG cycles, the\n\nanalogous known metrics are the Stenzel metrics [48] (see [49], [50] for useful background on the\nStenzel metrics). The Stenzel two-fold metric coincides with Eguchi-Hanson, and the Stenzel\nthree-fold metric coincides with the deformed conifold metric of [45] (see [51], [47] for additional\nbackground on the deformed conifold). For the G2 N\u03c4 metrics with co-associative cycles, the\nanalogous known metrics are the BSGPP metrics [43], [44] on R3 bundles over S 4 or CP2 . For the\nG2 N\u03c4 metric with an associative cycle, the analogous known metric is the BSGPP metric [43],\n[44] on an R4 bundle over S 3 . See [52], [53], [50] for more background on the complete G2 metrics.\nFor the Sp(2) N\u03c4 metric with a CLAG cycle, the analogous known metric is the Calabi metric\non T \u2217 CP2 [54]; the Calabi metric is the unique complete regular hyper-K\u00e4hler eight-manifold of\n4\n\nThe N\u03c4 metrics have almost certainly been found before, though because they are incomplete, they have been\npresumably been rejected hitherto as pathological and uninteresting. What now makes them interesting is their\ninterpretation as special holonomy interpolations of AdS solutions, for which their incompleteness is probably a\npre-requisite: see conjecture 2 below.\n\n6\n\n\fco-homogeneity one [55]; for further background on the Calabi metric, see [56]. Finally, for the\nSpin(7) N\u03c4 metric with a Cayley four-cycle, we have seen that the analogous known metric is the\nBSGPP metric on an R4 bundle over S 4 ; see [52], [53], [50] for more details.\nWhat is most striking about the conjectured special holonomy interpolations obtained here is\nthat they are all singular. As occurs in the conical context, the expectation is that the singularity\nof the special holonomy manifold is excised in the interpolating solution, and that the conformal\ndual of the geometry gives a quantum gravitational definition of this process. If this is correct,\nthen a singularity of the special holonomy manifold is an essential ingredient of the geometry of\nAdS/CFT. It would also explain a hitherto rather puzzling feature of the AdS solutions studied\nhere, all of which were originally constructed in gauged supergravity. While for the N\u03c4 series it\nis possible to obtain the known special holonomy manifolds by replacing the H n factors with S n\nfactors, for their AdS interpolations this does not seem to be possible; the AdS solutions exist only\nfor hyperbolic cycles. This makes sense if an AdS/CFT dual can exist only for a singular special\nholonomy manifold; otherwise, if AdS solutions like those studied here, but with S n cycles, existed,\ntheir special holonomy interpolations would be non-singular. Another way of saying this is that it\nseems that a conformal field theory can be associated to the singular N\u03c4 series of special holonomy\n\nmetrics, but not to their non-singular known analogues. If this idea is correct, it means that\nwhat the AdS/CFT correspondence is ultimately describing is the quantum gravity of singularity\nresolution for special holonomy manifolds. We formalise the geometry of this idea in the following\ntwo conjectures.\nConjecture 1 Every supersymmetric Anti-de Sitter solution of M-/string theory admits a special\nholonomy interpolation.\nConjecture 2 With the exception of flat space, the metric on every special holonomy manifold\nadmitting an Anti-de Sitter interpolation is incomplete.\n\nThe organisation of the remainder of this paper is as follows. In section two, as useful introductory material, we will review the relationship between the canonical AdS and Minkowski frames for\nAdS solutions, how to pass from one to the other by means of a frame rotation, and the relationship\nbetween the AdS and wrapped brane structures. In section three, we will derive the conjectured\nspecial holonomy interpolations of AdS solutions for fivebranes wrapped on cycles in Calabi-Yau\nmanifolds. Section four is devoted to the proposed Sp(2) interpolating pair, section five to the G2\ninterpolating pairs and section six to the Spin(7) interpolating pair. In section seven we conclude\nand discuss interesting future directions.\n\n7\n\n\f2\n\nCanonical Minkowski frames for AdS manifolds\n\nIn this section we will review how the canonical AdS frame defined by all the Killing spinors of a\nsupersymmetric AdS solution is related to its canonical Minkowski frame defined by half its Killing\nspinors; for more details, the reader is referred to [13], [39]-[41]. The canonical Minkowski structure\nof an AdS solution is the one which can match on to the G-structure of an interpolating solution.\nThis phenomenon - the matching of the structure defined by half the supersymmetries of the AdS\nmanifold to that of an interpolating solution - is another, more precise way of stating the familiar\nfeature of supersymmetry doubling in the near-horizon limit of a supergravity brane solution.\nWe will in fact distinguish two cases, which will be discussed seperately. The AdS solutions we\nstudy for fivebranes on cycles in manifolds of SU(2), SU(3) or G2 holonomy have purely magnetic\nfluxes. This means that no membranes are present in the geometry. However, the AdS solutions for\nfivebranes on four-cycles in eight-manifolds (Spin(7), SU(4) or Sp(2) holonomies) have both electric and magnetic fluxes. In probe-brane language, we can think of a stack of fivebranes wrapped a\nfour-cycle in the eight-manifold. We also have a stack of membranes extended in the three overall\ntransverse directions to the eight-manifold. The membrane stack intersects the fivebrane stack in a\nstring; the low-energy effective field theory on the string worldvolume is then the two-dimensional\ndual of the AdS3 solutions that come from these geometries. The presence of the membranes complicates the relationship of the AdS and Minkowski frames a little, so first we will discuss the case\nof fivebranes alone, and purely magnetic fluxes.\n\n2.1\n\nAdS spacetimes from fivebranes on cycles in SU (2), SU (3) and G2\nmanifolds\n\nThe metric of an interpolating solution describing a stack of fivebranes wrapped on a calibrated\ncycle in a Calabi-Yau two- or three-fold, or a G2 manifold, takes the form\n\u0010\n\u0001\u0011\n2\n2\n2\n10\u2212p\u2212q\n2\n\u22121\n2\n1,p\n2\n2\n,\nds = L ds (R ) + ds (Mq ) + L dt + t ds S\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere Mq admits a globally-defined SU(2), SU(3) or G2 structure respectively. The Minkowski\nisometries are isometries of the full solution, and the flux has no components along the Minkowski\n\ndirections. The dimensionality of Mq is q = 4, 6, 7, respectively. The dimensionality of the unwrapped fivebrane worldvolume is p + 1, so p = 3 for a K\u00e4hler two-cycle, p = 2 for a SLAG\nor associative three-cycle, and p = 1 for a co-associative four-cyle. The intrinsic torsion of the\nG-structure on Mq must satisfy certain conditions, implied by supersymmetry and the four-form\nBianchi identity. These conditions are what are called the wrapped brane equations; they will be\n\n8\n\n\fgiven for each case below, and need not concern us now. For more details, the reader is referred to\n[39].\nOur interest here is how to obtain a warped product AdS metric from the wrapped-brane\nmetric (2.1), and vice versa. The first step is to recognise that every warped-product AdSp+2\nmetric, written in Poincar\u00e9 coordinates, may be thought of as a special case of a warped R1,p\nmetric. If the AdS warp factor is denoted by \u03bb, and is independent of the AdS coordinates, then\n\u03bb\u22121 ds2 (AdSp+2) = \u03bb\u22121 [e\u22122r ds2 (R1,p ) + dr 2 ].\n\n(2.2)\n\nTherefore our first step is to identify L = \u03bbe2r in (2.1), with r the AdS radial coordinate. The\nnext step is to pick out the AdS radial direction r\u0302 = \u03bb\u22121/2 dr from the space transverse to the R1,p\nfactor in (2.1). In the cases of interest to us, the AdS radial direction is a linear combination of the\nradial direction v\u0302 = Ldt on the overall transverse space, and a radial direction in Mq , transverse\n\nto the wrapped cycle. We denote this radial basis one-form on Mq by \u00fb. Thus we can obtain the\nAdS radial basis one-form by a local rotation of the frame of (2.1):\nr\u0302 = sin \u03b8\u00fb + cos \u03b8v\u0302,\n\n(2.3)\n\nfor some local angle \u03b8 which we take to be independent of r. Denoting the orthogonal linear\ncombination in the AdS frame by \u03c1\u0302, we have\n\u03c1\u0302 = cos \u03b8\u00fb \u2212 sin \u03b8v\u0302.\n\n(2.4)\n\nNow, imposing closure of dt and r-independence of \u03b8, we get\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\n\u03bb\nd(\u03bb\u22123/2 cos \u03b8).\n2 sin \u03b8\n\n(2.5)\n\nDefining a coordinate \u03c1 for the AdS frame according to \u03c1 = \u03bb\u22123/2 cos \u03b8, we get\n\u03c1\nt = \u2212 e\u22122r ,\n2\n\u03bb\nd\u03c1.\n\u03c1\u0302 = p\n2 1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12\n\n(2.6)\n\nFinally, we impose that the metric on the space tranverse to the AdS factor is independent of\nthe AdS radial coordinate, and (in deriving the AdS supersymmetry conditions from the wrapped\nbrane equations) that the flux has no components along the AdS radial direction. Thus we obtain\nthe (for our purposes) general AdSp+2 metric contained in (2.1):\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0001\nd\u03c12\n\u03bb3\n2\n2\n2\n10\u2212p\u2212q\n2\n\u22121\nds (AdSp+2 ) +\n+ \u03c1 ds S\n+ ds2 (Mq\u22121 ),\n(2.7)\nds = \u03bb\n4 1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12\n9\n\n\fwhere ds2 (Mq\u22121 ) is defined by\nds2 (Mq ) = ds2 (Mq\u22121 ) + \u00fb \u2297 \u00fb.\n\n(2.8)\n\nIn addition, we have\n\u00fb = \u03bb\n\nr\n\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12\ndr +\n\u03bb3\n\ns\n\n!\n\u03bb3\n\u03c1\nd\u03c1 .\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12 2\n\n(2.9)\n\nSince in general we know the relationship between the Minkowski-frame coordinate t and the AdS\nframe coordinates r, \u03c1, when we know \u03bb explicitly for a particular solution, we can integrate (2.9)\nto find an explicit coordinatisation of the AdS solution in the Minkowski frame. Thus we can pass\nfreely from one frame to the other, for any explicit solution.\nHaving discussed the relationship of the frames, let us now discuss the relationship between\nthe structures. Since, in passing from (2.1) to (2.7) we pick out a preferred direction on Mq , the\nG-structure of (2.1) on Mq is reduced to a G\u2032 structure on Mq\u22121 in (2.7). For q = 4, the SU(2)\nstructure on M4 is reduced to an identity structure on M3 ; the SU(2) forms on M4 decompose\naccording to\nJ4 = e1 \u2227 e2 + e3 \u2227 \u00fb,\n\n\u03a94 = (e1 + ie2 ) \u2227 (e3 + i\u00fb),\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\nwith\nds2 (M4 ) = e1 \u2297 e1 + e2 \u2297 e2 + e3 \u2297 e3 + \u00fb \u2297 \u00fb.\n\n(2.12)\n\nFor q = 6, the SU(3) structure on M6 reduces to an SU(2) structure on M5 ; the SU(3) structure\nforms decompose according to\nJ6 = J4 + e5 \u2227 \u00fb,\n\n\u03a96 = \u03a94 \u2227 (e5 + i\u00fb),\n\n(2.13)\n\nwith\nds2 (M6 ) = ds2 (M5 ) + \u00fb \u2297 \u00fb = ds2 (M4 ) + e5 \u2297 e5 + \u00fb \u2297 \u00fb,\n\n(2.14)\n\nand the SU(2) structure of the AdS frame is defined on M4 . For q = 7, the G2 structure on M7\nreduces to an SU(3) structure on M6 ; the G2 structure forms decompose according to\n\u03a6 = J6 \u2227 \u00fb \u2212 Im\u03a96 ,\n1\nJ6 \u2227 J6 + Re\u03a96 \u2227 \u00fb,\n\u03a5 =\n2\n\n10\n\n(2.15)\n\n\fwith\nds2 (M7 ) = ds2 (M6 ) + \u00fb \u2297 \u00fb,\n\n(2.16)\n\nand the SU(3) structure of the AdS frame is defined on M6 .\n\n2.2\n\nAdS spacetimes from fivebranes on four-cycles in eight-manifolds\nof Spin(7), SU(4) or Sp(2) holonomy\n\nAs discussed above, because of the presence of non-zero electric flux for AdS3 solutions from fivebranes on four-cycles in eight-manifolds, the relationship between the canonical AdS and Minkowski\nframes of the AdS solutions is a little more complicated. These systems are the subject of [41], to\nwhich the reader is referred for more details5 . The metric of an interpolating solution describing\na stack of fivebranes wrapped on a four-cycle in an eight-manifold, with a stack of membranes\nextended in the transverse directions, takes the form\nds2 = L\u22121 ds2 (R1,1 ) + ds2 (M8 ) + C 2 dt2 .\n\n(2.17)\n\nAgain, the Minkowski isometries are isometries of the full solution, the electric flux contains a factor\nproportional to the Minkowski volume form, and the magnetic flux has no components along the\nMinkowski directions. The Minkowski directions represent the unwrapped fivebrane worldvolume\ndirections; the membranes extend in these directions and also along dt. Note that in this case\nthe warp factor of the overall transverse space (the R coordinatised by t) is independent of the\nMinkowski warp factor. The global G-structure is defined on M8 ; the structure group is Spin(7),\nSU(4) or Sp(2), as appropriate. Again, supersymmetry, the four-form Bianchi identity, and now,\nthe four-form field equation imply restrictions on the intrinsic torsion of the global G-structure.\nThese equations, the wrapped brane equations for these systems, are given in [41].\nTo obtain an AdS3 metric from (2.17), we again require that that L = \u03bbe2r , with r the AdS\nradial coordinate and \u03bb the AdS warp factor, which we require to be independent of the AdS\ncoordinates. As before, we must now pick out the AdS radial direction r\u0302 = \u03bb\u22121/2 dr from the space\ntransverse to the Minkowski factor. In the generic case of interest to us, the AdS radial direction\nis a linear combination of the overall transverse direction e9 = Cdt and a radial direction in M8\ntransverse to the cycle that we denote by e8 . Thus, as before, we write the frame rotation relating\n5\n\nIn [41], somewhat more general wrapped brane metrics were considered than those of this discussion. However\nthe discussion of this section is sufficiently general for the applications of interest in this paper.\n\n11\n\n\fthe Minkowski and AdS frames as\nr\u0302 = sin \u03b8e8 + cos \u03b8e9 ,\n\u03c1\u0302 = cos \u03b8e8 \u2212 sin \u03b8e9 ,\n\n(2.18)\n\nfor a local rotation angle \u03b8 which we take to be independent of the AdS radial coordinate. Imposing\nAdS isometries on the electric and magnetic flux, and requiring that the metric on the space\ntransverse to the AdS factor is independent of the AdS coordinates, we find that we may introduce\nan AdS frame coordinate \u03c1 such that\n\u03bb\u22123/2 cos \u03b8 = f (\u03c1),\n\u03bb\np\nd\u03c1,\n2 1 \u2212 \u03bb3 f 2\n\n\u03c1\u0302 =\n\n(2.19)\n\nfor some arbitrary function f (\u03c1). See [41] for a fuller discussion of this point. Then the general\nAdS metric contained in (2.17) is\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bb3\n1\n2\n2\n2\nds (AdS3 ) +\nd\u03c1 + ds2 (M7 ),\nds =\n\u03bb\n4(1 \u2212 \u03bb3 f 2 )\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere ds2 (M7 ) is defined by\nds2 (M8 ) = ds2 (M7 ) + e8 \u2297 e8 .\n\n(2.21)\n\nThe basis one-forms of the Minkowski frame are given in terms of the basis one-forms of the AdS\nframe by\ns\n!\nr\n3\n2\n3\n1\n\u2212\n\u03bb\nf\n\u03bb\nf\ne8 = \u03bb\ndr +\nd\u03c1 ,\n\u03bb3\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3 f 2 2\n1\nCdt = \u03bbf dr \u2212 \u03bbd\u03c1.\n2\n\n(2.22)\n\nFor an explicit AdS3 solution we know \u03bb and f explicitly, and so we can integrate these expressions\nto get an explicit coordinatisation of the AdS solution in the Minkowski frame. Thus we can freely\npass between the canonical AdS and Minkowski frames for known AdS solutions.\nAs in the previous subsection, because we are picking out a preferred direction on M8 , the\n\nMinkowski-frame structure on M8 is reduced, in the AdS frame, to a structure on M7 . A Spin(7)\nstructure on M8 is reduced to a G2 structure on M7 ; the decomposition of the Cayley four-form is\n\u2212\u03c6 = \u03a5 + \u03a6 \u2227 e8 .\n\n12\n\n(2.23)\n\n\fAn SU(4) structure on M8 is reduced to an SU(3) structure on M7 . The decomposition of the\nSU(4) structure forms is\nJ8 = J6 + e7 \u2227 e8 ,\n\n\u03a98 = \u03a96 \u2227 (e7 + ie8 ),\n\n(2.24)\n\nwith\nds2 (M8 ) = ds2 (M7 ) + e8 \u2297 e8 = ds2 (M6 ) + e7 \u2297 e7 + e8 \u2297 e8 ,\n\n(2.25)\n\nwith the SU(3) structure forms defined on ds2 (M6 ). Finally, an Sp(2) structure on M8 reduces\nto an SU(2) structure on ds2 (M7 ). The decomposition of the triplet of Sp(2) almost complex\nstructures (which obey the algebra J A J B = \u2212\u03b4 AB + \u01ebABC J C , A = 1, 2, 3) under SU(2) is\nJ 1 = K 3 + e5 \u2227 e6 + e7 \u2227 e8 ,\n\nJ 2 = K 2 \u2212 e5 \u2227 e7 + e6 \u2227 e8 ,\nJ 3 = K 1 + e6 \u2227 e7 + e5 \u2227 e8 ,\n\n(2.26)\n\nwith\nds2 (M8 ) = ds2 (M4 ) + e5 \u2297 e5 + e6 \u2297 e6 + e7 \u2297 e7 + e8 \u2297 e8 ,\n\n(2.27)\n\nand the K A are a triplet of self-dual SU(2)-invariant two-forms on M4 , which satisfy the algebra6\nK A K B = \u2212\u03b4 AB \u2212 \u01ebABC K C . Having concluded the introductory review, we now move on to the\nmain results of the paper.\n\n3\n\nCalabi-Yau interpolating pairs\n\nIn this section, we will give conjectured interpolating pairs for fivebranes wrapped on calibrated\ncycles in Calabi-Yau manifolds. First we will discuss K\u00e4hler cycles, then SLAG cycles. In order to\npresent a complete picture, we will summarise the results of [31] for K\u00e4hler two-cycles in two-folds\nand three-folds. In the new cases, we will first present the pair, and then give the derivation of the\nspecial holonomy interpolation from the AdS solution.\n\n3.1\n\nK\u00e4hler cycles\n\nIn this subsection, the AdS solutions for which we give a conjectured special holonomy interpolation are: the half-BPS AdS5 solution of [21], describing the near-horizon limit of fivebranes on\n6\n\nThe slightly eccentric labelling of the SU (2) structure forms is chosen to coincide with an unfortunate conventional quirk of [41].\n\n13\n\n\fa two-cycle in a two-fold; the quarter-BPS AdS5 solution of [21], for a two-cycle in a three-fold;\nand the AdS3 solution of [24], admitting four Killing spinors, for a four-cycle in a four-fold. The\nspecial holonomy interpolations of the first two cases are derived in [31]; here we will just describe\nthe conjectured pair. All the other pairs given in this paper are new, and their derivation will be\ngiven.\n\n3.1.1\n\nTwo-fold\n\nThe conjectured interpolating pair The metric of the half-BPS AdS5 solution of [21] is given\nby\nds\n\n2\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1 2 2\nd\u03c12\n\u03bb3\n1\n2\n3 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nds (AdS5 ) + ds (H ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb \u03c1 )(d\u03c8 \u2212 P ) +\n+ \u03c1 ds (S ) ,\n=\n\u03bb\n2\n4 1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12\n\u03bb3 =\n\n8\n,\n1 + 4\u03c12\n(3.1)\n\nwhere dP = Vol[H 2 ].

At R = 0 (corresponding to \u03be = \u03c0/2) an S 3 degenerates\nsmoothly, provided that \u03c8 has the same periodicity as for the AdS coordinate. The metric is\n\u221a\nsingular at R = 2/ 3 (corresponding to \u03be = \u2212\u03c0/2) where the K\u00e4hler H 2 cycle degenerates. This\nmetric is the hyperbolic analogue of the resolved conifold metric of [45], [46].\n3.1.3\n\nFour-folds\n\nThe interpolating pairs This is the first new case we encounter. A set of AdS3 solutions was\nconstructed by Gauntlett, Kim and Waldram (GKW) in [24], that describe the near-horizon limit\nof M5 branes on a K\u00e4hler four-cycle in a Calabi-Yau four-fold, intersecting membranes extended in\nthe directions transverse to the four-fold. The AdS solutions admit four Killing spinors, and are\nas follows.

In addition,\ndP = Vol[S 2 ],\ndP \u2032 = R4 .\n\n(3.8)\n\nThe range of \u03c1 is \u03c1 \u2208 [\u22122, 2]; at the end-points, an S 3 smoothly degenerates, provided that \u03c8\n\nis periodically identified with period 4\u03c0. These manifolds admit an SU(3) structure, which was\nobtained in [41], and will be given below (in somewhat more transparent coordinates), together\nwith the magnetic flux (the electric flux, which is irrelevant to the discussion, can be obtained from\n[24] or [41]).\nThe conjectured special holonomy interpolation of these manifolds is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,2 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n(3.9)\n\nwhere, up to an overall scale,\n\u0011\n1\ncos2 \u03be\n1 \u0010 2\n2\n\u2032 2\n2\n2\nds2 (N\u03c4 ) = (1 + sin \u03be)ds2 (KE\u2212\ndR\n+\nR\n(d\u03c8\n+\nP\n\u2212\nP\n)\n,\n)\n+\nds\n(S\n)\n+\n4\n2\n2(1 + sin \u03be)\ncos2 \u03be\n2\n1\n(3.10)\n\u2212 sin3 \u03be + sin \u03be = \u2212 R2 .\n3\n3\nThis is identical to the three-fold metric of the previous subsection, but with the H 2 replaced by a\nKE\u2212\n4 . It has the same regularity properties, and is the hyperbolic analogue of the four-fold resolved\nconifold. Now we will discuss its derivation.\nThe G-structure of the AdS solutions First we will give the SU(3) structure of the AdS\nsolutions, defined by all four Killing spinors.

The\nfivebrane worldvolume directions are the Minkowski and KE\u2212\n4 directions; the membranes extend\nalong the Minkowski and t directions.

To determine the Calabi-Yau\ninterpolation with this ansatz, we set HM 5,M 2 = 1 and require that F1,2 are functions only of u.\nThe derivation of the Calabi-Yau metric is now identical to that for the three-fold interpolation of\nthe previous subsection, as given in [31]. This close analogy between fivebranes wrapped on K\u00e4hler\nfour-cycles in four-folds and two-cycles in three-folds has recently been used to construct infinite\nfamilies of AdS3 solutions [28], [29], [30] motivated by the analogous AdS5 solutions [13].\n\n18\n\n\fIn any event, to determine the special holonomy metric, observe that closure of \u03a98 , with the\nobvious frame inherited from the AdS solution, is automatic.

The AdS solutions for which a Calabi-Yau interpolation is derived\nare respectively the AdS4 solution of [23], admitting eight Killing spinors; and the AdS3 solution\nof [24], admitting four Killing spinors. In each case we will first give the conjectured pair, then the\nderivation of the Calabi-Yau interpolation from the AdS solution.\n\n3.2.1\n\nThree-fold\n\nThe interpolating pair The eleven-dimensional lift of the AdS4 solution of [23] was later interpreted [24] as the near-horizon limit of fivebranes wrapped on a SLAG three-cycle in a three-fold.\nThe metric is given by\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n\u03bb3\n1\n2\n2\n3\n3 2\na\na\n2\n2\n2\n1\n2\nds (AdS4 ) + ds (H ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb \u03c1 )DY DY +\nd\u03c1 + \u03c1 ds (S ) ,\nds =\n\u03bb\n4(1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12 )\n\n19\n\n\f\u03bb3 =\n\n2\n.\n8 + \u03c12\n\n(3.29)\n\nThe flux, which in this case is purely magnetic and irrelevant to the discussion, may be obtained\nfrom [24] or [39].

The range of \u03c1 is \u03c1 \u2208 [\u22122, 2]; at the endpoints, the\nS 3 degenerates smoothly. The electric flux may be obtained from [24] or [41]; the magnetic flux\nwill be given below.\n\nDenoting a basis for H 4 by ea , the metric of the conjectured Calabi-Yau interpolation of this\nsolution is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,2 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n(3.55)\n\nwhere, up to an overall scale,\nds2 (N\u03c4 ) =\n\n(2 + cos 2\u03b8)1/4 h 2\ncos \u03b8(ea \u2212 Y a Y b eb )2 + sin2 \u03b8DY a DY a\ncos \u03b8\n\u0011i\n3 cos \u03b8 sin3 2\u03b8 \u0010 2\na a 2\n.\nd\u03b8\n+\n(Y\ne\n)\n+\n8 sin3 \u03b8(2 + cos 2\u03b8)\n\n(3.56)\n\nThis metric is the hyperbolic analogue of the Stenzel four-fold. Without loss of generality, we can\ntake the range of \u03b8 to be \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0/2). Near \u03b8 = 0, the S 3 degenerates smoothly, and up to a scale\nthe metric is given by\n\nds2 = ds2 (H 4 ) + d\u03b82 + \u03b82 DY a DY a .\n\n(3.57)\n\nThe other degeneration point, \u03b8 = \u03c0/2, is singular. Now we give the derivation of the conjectured\ninterpolation.\nThe G-structure of the AdS solution The AdS3 solution admits an SU(3) structure defined\nby all four Killing spinors. The structure satisfies the torsion conditions of [41] for the near-horizon\nlimit of fivebranes on a SLAG four-cycle in a four-fold, together with the Bianchi identity for the\nmagnetic flux, dFmag = 0, which in this case is not implied by the torsion conditions.

In the AdS metric (4.1), the Y a , a = 1, ..., 4\nparameterise an S 3 , Y a Y a = 1, and\n\nDY a = dY a + \u03c9 a b Y b ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nwith \u03c9ab the spin connection one-forms of B4 . The electric flux is irrelevant to the discussion, and\nmay be obtained from [25] or [41]; the magnetic flux will be given below.\nTo give the conjectured special holonomy interpolation of this metric, we first make the following\ndefinitions. Let ea denote a basis for the Bergman metric (4.2). Let J A , A = 1, 2, 3, denote a basis\nof self-dual SU(2) invariant three-forms on B4 , obeying the algebra J A J B = \u2212\u03b4 AB \u2212 \u01ebABC J C , and\nlet J 3 be the K\u00e4hler form of B4 .

The wrapped cycle \u03a34 is an arbitrary conformally half-flat Einstein manifold, with\nscalar curvature normalised such that R = \u221212. This means that the Ricci tensor of \u03a34 is given by\nRij = \u22123gij ,\n\n(5.2)\n\nJ4aij Cijkl = 0,\n\n(5.3)\n\nand the Weyl tensor is anti-self-dual,\n\n34\n\n\ffor a triplet of self-dual two-forms J4a , a = 1, 2, 3, on \u03a34 . An example of such a manifold is hyperbolic\nfour-space H 4 . The Y a are constrained coordinates on S 2 , Y a Y a = 1, and\n1\nDY a = dY a \u2212 \u01ebabc Y b \u03c9ij J4cij ,\n2\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere \u03c9ij are the spin connection one-forms of \u03a34 . The range of \u03c1, which without loss of generality\n\u221a\nis taken to be non-negative, is \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 8/3 3]. At \u03c1 = 0 the R-symmetry S 1 degenerates smoothly9 ,\n\u221a\nwhile at \u03c1 = 8/3 3 the S 2 parameterised by the Y a degenerates smoothly.\nThe metric of the conjectured G2 interpolation of these AdS solutions is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,3 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n(5.5)\n\nwhere up to an overall scale,\nR2\nR2 2\nds (\u03a34 ) +\nds (N\u03c4 ) =\n2\n4\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n1\n1\na\na\n\u2212 1 DY DY +\n\u22121\ndR2 .\nR4\nR4\n\n(5.6)\n\nThe range of R is R \u2208 (0, 1]. At R = 1, the S 2 degenerates smoothly. The metric is singular at\nR = 0 where the co-associative \u03a34 degenerates. These metrics are the analogues, for negatively\ncurved conformally half-flat Einstein \u03a34 , of the regular BSGPP G2 metrics on R3 bundles over S 4\nor CP2 [43], [44].

For special holonomy we must have L = constant, which we take\n\nto be unity. We also must have that F1,2,3 are functions of u only; the function F3 is then at our\ndisposal, and we set it to 1. The condition of G2 holonomy is then\nd\u03a6 = d\u03a5 = 0,\n\n(5.18)\n\nds2 (N\u03c4 ) = F12 ds2 (\u03a34 ) + F22 DY a DY a + du2 ,\n\n(5.19)\n\nfor the metric\n\nwith the G2 structure inherited from the AdS frame,\n\u03a6 = J6 \u2227 du \u2212 Im\u03a96 ,\n1\n\u03a5 =\nJ6 \u2227 J6 + Re\u03a9 \u2227 du,\n2\n1\nJ6 = F12 Y a J4a + F22 \u01ebabc Y a DY b \u2227 DY c ,\n2\n2\nabc a\n\u03a96 = F1 F2 (\u01eb Y DY b \u2227 J4c + iDY a \u2227 J4a ).\n\n(5.20)\n\nWith R = \u221212, closure of \u03a6 implies\n\u2202u (F12 F2 ) = F22 \u2212 F12 ,\n\n(5.21)\n\nwhile closure of \u03a5 implies\n\u2202u (F14 ) = 4F12 F2 ,\n2\u2202u (F12 F22 ) = \u22124F12 F2 .\n37\n\n(5.22)\n\n\fIt is readily verified that (5.22) imply (5.21). Integrating (5.22) is straightforward. Adding, we find\nthat\nF22 =\n\n\u03b12\nF12\n,\n\u2212\n2F12\n2\n\n(5.23)\n\nfor some constant \u03b1.

The constant \u03b12 may be set\nto unity, up to an overall scale in the metric. Defining a new coordinate R4 = x/4, the G2 metrics\nconjectured to be the interpolation of the co-associative AdS3 solutions of [24] are as given above.\n\n5.2\n\nAssociative cycle\n\nThe interpolating pair The AdS4 solution of [22], describing the near-horizon limit of Mfivebranes wrapped on an associative three-cycle in a G2 manifold, admits four Killing spinors, and\nis as follows.

The range of \u03c1 is \u03c1 \u2208 [\u22121, 1], with the S 3 degenerating smoothly at\n\u03c1 = \u00b11.\n\nThe conjectured G2 interpolation of this metric is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,3 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n38\n\n(5.28)\n\n\fwhere up to an overall scale\n\u0011\nR2 \u0010 1\nR2 2 3\nds (H ) +\n\u2212 1 \u03bca \u03bca +\nds (N\u03c4 ) =\n3\n3\n9 R\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u22121\nR3\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\ndR2 .\n\n(5.29)\n\nThis metric is singular where the associative H 3 degenerates, at R = 0. At R = 1, the S 3\ndegenerates smoothly. This N\u03c4 metric is a singular hyperbolic analogue of the BSGPP G2 metric\non an R4 bundle over S 3 of [43], [44]. This N\u03c4 metric was also found in [59], as the conjectured G2\ninterpolation of the AdS2 IIB solution of [26], for D3 branes wrapped on an associative three-cycle.\n\nIf it is indeed the interpolation of both these AdS solutions, then there are two distinct conformal\ntheories that have their origins in this geometry. The first is a superconformal quatum mechanics,\narising on the unwrapped (time) direction of D3-branes on the H 3 of (5.29); the second is a threedimensional superconformal theory, arising on the unwrapped worldvolume directions of M5-branes\non the H 3 . Now we discuss the derivation of N\u03c4 from the M-theory AdS4 solution.\nThe G-structure of the AdS solution With ea a basis for H 3 , the SU(3) structure of the\nAdS solution, defined by all its four Killing spinors, is [39]\n4 p\n\u221a\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12 \u03bca \u2227 ea ,\n5 5\u03bb\n8\n1\n8\n\u221a\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12 ) \u01ebabc ea \u2227 \u03bcb \u2227 \u03bcc \u2212 \u221a\nVol[H 3 ],\n=\n3/2\n3/2\n2\n25 5\u03bb\n5 5\u03bb\nr\n\u0012\n\u00133\np\n1 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u03c12 1 abc a\n8\n1\n2\nabc a\nb\nc\n3 \u03c12\n\u01eb\n\u03bc\n\u2227\n\u03bc\n\u2227\n\u03bc\n\u2212\n\u01eb \u03bc \u2227 eb \u2227 ec .

We make the following\nmetric ansatz for this solution:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = L\u22121 ds2 (R1,2 ) + F12 ds2 (H 3 ) + L2 F32 du2 + F22 \u03bca \u03bca + dt2 ,\n40\n\n(5.40)\n\n\fwith L, F1,2,3 functions of u and t. For special holonomy we set L = 1, and require that F1,2,3 are\narbitrary functions of u. In fact, the determination of the G2 metric from this point on exactly\nfollows that of [59], where a conjectured G2 interpolation of the AdS2 solution of [26] for a D3 brane\nwrapped on an associative three-cycle was studied. The ansatz for the G2 manifold is exactly the\nsame, and the reader is referred to [59] for the rest of the derivation, or invited to perform it as a\nuseful excercise.\n\n6\n\nSpin(7) interpolating pairs\n\nIn this section, we will give conjectured interpolating pairs for fivebranes wrapped on Cayley fourcycles in Spin(7) manifolds. First we give the pairs, then the derivation of the Spin(7) interpolations.\nThe interpolating pairs The GKW AdS3 solutions [24] describing the near-horizon limit of\nfivebranes on Cayley four-cycles, with membranes in the overall transverse directions, admit two\nKilling spinors and have metrics given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n7 2\n\u03bb3\n1\n2\n3 2\na\na\n2\n2\nds (AdS3 ) + ds (\u03a34 ) + (1 \u2212 \u03bb f )DY DY +\nd\u03c1 ,\nds =\n\u03bb\n4\n4(1 \u2212 \u03bb3 f 2 )\n\u03bb3 =\n\n6\u03c1\n49\n, f= .\n2\n84 + 15\u03c1\n7\n\n(6.1)\n\nThe electric flux may be obtained from [24] or [41], and the magnetic flux will be given below.\nThe wrapped cycle \u03a34 is an arbitrary conformally-half flat negative scalar curvature Einstein fourmanifold, normalised such that the Ricci scalar is R = \u221212. We have flipped the definition of\n\norientation on \u03a34 relative to [24]; the conformally half-flat condition reads J Aij Cijkl = 0, with\nJ A , A = 1, 2, 3, a basis of self-dual two-forms on \u03a34 and Cijkl the Weyl tensor on \u03a34 . The Y a ,\na = 1, ..., 4 are constrained coordinates on an S 3 , Y a Y a = 1, and\n1\nDY a = dY a + \u03c9cdJ Acd J Aab Y b ,\n4\n\n(6.2)\n\nwhere \u03c9ab are the spin connection one-forms of \u03a34 . The range of \u03c1 is \u03c1 \u2208 [\u22122, 2]; at the end-points,\nthe S 3 degenerates smoothly.\nThe conjectured Spin(7) interpolation of this metric is\nds2 = ds2 (R1,2 ) + ds2 (N\u03c4 ),\n\n41\n\n(6.3)\n\n\fwhere up to an overall scale\n9\n36 2\nds (N\u03c4 ) = R2 ds2 (\u03a34 ) +\nR\n20\n100\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nR10/3\n\n\u0013\n\na\n\na\n\n\u2212 1 DY DY +\n\n\u0012\n\n1\nR10/3\n\n\u22121\n\n\u0013\u22121\n\ndR2 .\n\n(6.4)\n\nThese metrics are singular at R = 0, where the Cayley four-cycle \u03a34 degenerates. At R = 1, the\nS 3 degenerates smoothly. As discussed in the introduction these metrics are the analogues, for\nnegatively curved conformally half-flat Einstein \u03a34 , of the regular BSGPP Spin(7) metric on an\nR4 bundle over S 4 , [43], [44]. We now give the derivation of the N\u03c4 metric from the AdS metric.\nThe G-structure of the AdS solution The solution admits a G2 structure, defined by both its\nKilling spinors, which satisfies the torsion conditions of [37]10 together with the Bianchi identity for\nthe magnetic flux (also given in [37]) which in this case is not implied by the torsion conditions. the\ntorsion conditions of [37] were interpreted in [41] as the conditions defining the near-horizon limit\nof fivebranes wrapped on a Cayley four-cycle. These conditions are satisfied by all supersymmetric\nAdS3 solutions of M-theory.

The importance of this concept in the geometry of the supersymmetric AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence has been stressed. Two conjectures have been made: that all supersymmetric\nAdS solutions of M-/string theory admit a special holonomy interpolation, and that, with the\nexception of flat space, all metrics on special holonomy manifolds admitting an AdS interpolation\nare incomplete. For a representative sample of known supersymmetric AdS solutions of M-theory,\na series of canditate incomplete special holonomy interpolations has been derived. The series of\ninterpolations is closely related to a set of celebrated complete special holonomy metrics.\nSeveral interesting directions for future research are suggested by the results of this paper.\nThe geometrical question of most importance is undoubtedly the construction of an interpolating\nsolution describing a wrapped brane, for one of the proposed interpolating pairs of this paper.\nSince the whole series of pairs share many common features, understanding how to do this for\none of them would almost certainly facilitate the construction of an interpolating solution for all.\nA reasonable guess for what the boundary conditions of an interpolating solution for these pairs\nshould be is the following. It should match on to an N\u03c4 metric at its regular degeneration point.\nIt should also match on the AdS solution at a degeneration point of its transverse space. There is\nan unfixed volume modulus in all of the N\u03c4 metrics; this will be fixed, in an interpolating solution,\nby the global topological requirement of matching onto an AdS solution. For the AdS solutions\nwithout R-symmetry isometries, the degeneration points of the transverse space are symmetric; an\ninterpolating solution should match on to one of them. For the AdS solutions with R-symmetry\nisometries, the degeneration points of the transverse space are asymmetric; in this case, it seems\n\n45\n\n\fplausible that an interpolating solution should match on to the AdS solution at its R-symmetry\ndegeneration point. Understanding how this comes about, and solving the wrapped brane equations\nfor an interpolating solution, is not just a problem in Riemannian geometry. It seems very likely that\nthe Lorenztian character of an interpolating solution will enter in an essential way, with the causal\nstructure of the interpolating solution playing a key part. This is because (at least by analogy with\nconical interpolations) an interpolating solution should match on to the special holonomy manifold\nat a spacelike infinity, and the AdS manifold at an event horizon. Of the two coordinates which\nplay a r\u00f4le in the frame rotation underlying the relationship between the interpolating pairs of\nthis paper, one has a finite range while the range of the other is infinite. Though they cannot\nreally be seperated, in a rough sense the non-compact direction should determine the Lorentzian,\ncausal structure, and the compact direction the Riemannian. A very delicate interplay between\nthe two is required, to fulfill the appropriate Lorenztian and Riemannian boundary conditions for\nan interpolating solution. Understanding the geometry of the frame rotation in more depth may\nreveal how to linearise the wrapped brane equations, and so superimpose the interpolating pair,\njust as for conical interpolations. Another intriguing point about the frame rotation is that the\nrelationship between the AdS and Minkowski frame coordinates is in every case given by the root\nof a polynomial. This strongly suggests some deeper underlying algebraic geometry which has not\nbeen appreciated.\nOther interesting geometrical questions raised by this work include the following. For branes\nwrapped on K\u00e4hler cycles, there exist rich classes of AdS solutions that have not been studied here.\nThese include AdS5 solutions from M-fivebranes on two-cycles in three-folds [13], AdS3 solutions\nfrom M-fivebranes on four-cycles in fourfolds [28], [30] and AdS3 solutions from D3-branes on twocycles in four-folds [29], [30]. It would be interesting to apply the methods of this paper to these\nother solutions, and so determine candidate interpolations. For the AdS-from-D3-brane solutions\nof [29], [30] it should be particularly feasible to construct the interpolating solutions, since in this\ncase the four-fold geometry is essentially conical [62], [30], [59]. Also AdS2 M-theory solutions have\nnot been discussed in this paper at all; a rich class has recently been discovered in [30], and some\nolder ones are to be found in [24]. Using the classification results of [63], [40], it would be interesting\nto determine their candidate interpolations.\nIt should also be possible to use the notion of an interpolating pair to construct new AdS\nsolutions. For all cases other than K\u00e4hler cycles, to the knowledge of the author, only a single AdS\nsolution is known to exist - the one studied in this paper. On the other hand, numerous complete\ncohomogeneity-one special holonomy metrics are known; for example, for G2 and Spin(7), several\ncomplete metrics, whose construction was inspired by the BSGPP metrics, were given in [52], [53].\nHyperbolic analogues of these metrics should also exist, and if so, it will almost certainly be possible\nto map them to new AdS solutions.\n\n46\n\n\fA more long-term project concerns the construction of the conformal quantum duals of the\ninterpolating pairs. In M-theory, this problem is hampered by the notoriously intractable question\nof the effective field theory on the worldvolume of a stack of fivebranes (for membranes, some\ninteresting progress on the world-volume theory, highlighting its non-associativity, has recently\nbeen made in [64]). In IIB, this is less of a problem, and it should be possible to make progress\nconstructing the duals of wrapped D3-brane geometries, even with existing techniques.\nIn the geometry of wrapped brane physics, we have for so long been restricted to the near-horizon\nlimit, the AdS geometry, that it has become commonplace to think that only this geometry is of\nrelevance to investigations of the CFT. Indeed, recently it has been shown that it is in fact possible\nin principle to reconstruct the CFT from the near-horizon geometry alone11 using holographic\nrenormalisation techniques [65], [66]. However, doing this for AdS geometries of the complexity of\nthose studied in this paper is likely to be very difficult indeed, if not impossible, in practice. And\nfocussing on the AdS geometry alone ignores the central message of this paper: that the geometry\nof AdS/CFT involves, in an essential way, both an Anti-de Sitter and a special holonomy manifold.\nIt is also possible, as a matter of principle, to construct the CFT dual from the geometry of the\nspecial holonomy manifold alone. It is worth recalling that this is how the quiver gauge theory\nduals of the Y p,q manifolds were in fact constructed [16], [17]; as, indeed, was N = 4 super Yang\nMills itself in this context [1]. Knowing both members of an interpolating pair means that CFT\nconstruction techniques can be brought to bear on both geometries; knowing both significantly\nenriches our understanding of the correspondence.\n\n8\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to express my gratitude to Jerome Gauntlett for ongoing discussions, collaboration\nand debate; and also to Dina Daskalopoulou, for general inspiration.
