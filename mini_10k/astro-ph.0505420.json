Several general trends have been identified for equilibrated, selfgravitating collisionless systems, such as density or anisotropy profiles. These are\nintegrated quantities which naturally depend on the underlying velocity distribution\nfunction (VDF) of the system. We study this VDF through a set of numerical\nsimulations, which allow us to extract both the radial and the tangential VDF. We find\nthat the shape of the VDF is universal, in the sense that it depends only on two things\nnamely the dispersion (radial or tangential) and the local slope of the density. Both the\nradial and the tangential VDF's are universal for a collection of simulations, including\ncontrolled collisions with very different initial conditions, radial infall simulation, and\nstructures formed in cosmological simulations.\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n2\n\n1. Introduction\nThe last few years have shown remarkable progress in the understanding of pure dark\nmatter structures. This has been provided initially by numerical simulations which have\nobserved general trends in the behaviour of the radial density profile of equilibrated\ndark matter structures from cosmological simulations, which roughly follow an NFW\nprofile [1, 2], see [3] for references. General trends in the radial dependence of the velocity\nanisotropy has also been suggested [4, 5]. More recently have more complex relations\nbeen identified, which even hold for systems which do not follow the most simple radial\nbehaviour in density. These relations are first that the phase-space density, \u03c1/\u03c3 3 , is\na power-law in radius [6], and second that there is a linear relationship between the\ndensity slope and the anisotropy [7].\nAll of these are integrated quantities, and still very little is known about the\nunderlying velocity distribution function (VDF) of real collisionless systems. We\nwill here initiate such a study by performing a set of different simulations of purely\ncollisionless systems. We will then extract the VDF and split this into the radial part\nand the tangential part for numerous bins in potential energy. This will allow us to\nmore fully appreciate the complicated structure of the VDF. We will show that within\nthe structures which have been perturbed strongly and subsequently allowed to relax,\nboth the radial and the tangential VDF's have a universal shape. This shape is given\nonly as function of the velocity dispersion and the local density slope.\n2. Head-on collisions\nThe first controlled simulation is the head-on collision between two initially isotropic\nNFW structures. For the construction of the initial structures, we use the Eddington\nmethod as described in [8], which imposes an exponential cut-off in the very outer\nregion. We create an initial NFW structure with zero anisotropy containing 1 million\nparticles. The parameters are chosen corresponding to a total mass of 1012 solar masses\n(concentration of 10), and half of the particles are within 160 kpc. The structure is\nin equilibrium in the sense that when evolving such a structure in isolation its global\nproperties remain unchanged.\nWe now place two such structures very far apart with 2000 kpc between the centres,\nwhich is well beyond the virial radius. Using a softening of 0.2 kpc, we now let these\ntwo structures collide head-on with an initial relative velocity of 100 km/sec towards\neach. After several crossings the resulting blob relaxes into a prolate structure. We\nrun all simulations until there is no further time variation in the radial dependence of\nthe anisotropy and density. We check that there is no (local) rotation. We run this\nsimulation for 150 Gyrs, which means that a very large part of the resulting structure\nis fully equilibrated.\nWe now take the resulting structure (now containing 2 million particles, in a prolate\nshape) and collide 2 copies together, again with their centres separated by 2000 kpc, and\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n3\n\nwith initial relative velocity of 100 km/sec. We now use softening of 1 kpc. The resulting\nstructure is even more prolate when observed in density contours, and we evolve this\nfor another 150 Gyr.\nAll simulations were carried out using PKDGRAV, a multi-stepping, parallel\ncode [9], which uses spline kernel softening and multi-stepping based on the local\nacceleration of particles. The simulations were performed on the zBox at Zurich\nUniversity.\nIn order to analyze the resulting structure we divide it into bins in potential\nenergy, linearly distributed from the softening length to beyond the region which is\nfully equilibrated. For the analysis and figures presented in this paper, we always only\ninclude a region outside 3 times the softening. We center the structure on the center\nof potential (using potential as weight-function instead of mass as done for center of\nmass). Most other analyses are centering on either the center of mass, or on the most\nbound particle, but the difference is very small. We calculate the local density for each\nparticle from its nearest 32 neighbours, and we average the density for all the particles\nin the potential bin. Similarly, each particle has a radius from the center of potential,\nand we can average this over all the particles in the potential bin. The resulting density\nprofile, h\u03c1i as a function of hri, is very similar to an NFW profile (see figure 1).\n\nFigure 1. Left panel: Resulting density profile of a repeated head-on collision between\ntwo initially isotropic NFW structures. The thin black line is of the NFW shape. Right\npanel: Resulting phase-space density profile of a repeated head-on collision between\ntwo initially isotropic NFW structures. The thin black lines are just power-laws in\nradius, with slopes \u22122.02 (radial), \u22121.85 (tangential), and \u22121.92 (total).\n\nOne can also calculate velocity dispersions for each potential bin of the structure.\nWe split the velocities into radial and tangential, and on figure 1 we present the phasespace density, \u03c1/\u03c3 3 , as a function of radius. The \u03c3 can be either the radial, tangential\nor total. The relationship between phase-space density and radius has been considered\n\n\f4\n\nA universal VDF\n\nseveral times [6, 10, 11, 12, 13] and seems to be well established. Using the Jeans\nequation together with the fact that phase-space density is a power-law in radius allows\none to find the density slope in the central region numerically [6], and even analytically\nfor power-law densities [14]. Recently a much refined study [10] using both the phasespace density being a power-law in radius and also the linear relationship between density\nslope and anisotropy, showed that one can solve the Jeans equations analytically and\nextract the radial dependence of density, anisotropy, mass etc. This analysis was made\nusing \u03c3rad . Whereas we here confirm that the phase-space density roughly follows a\npower-law in radius, then it is not clear which of the dispersions leads to a better fit to\na power-law (see figure 1). Given the fact that the anisotropy changes as function of\nradius, then if one of the phase-space densitities (e.g. using \u03c3rad ) is a power-law, then\nthe other (e.g. using \u03c3tot ) must have slightly s-shaped residuals.\nFor each bin we can also define the radial derivative of the density (the density\nslope)\n\u03b1\u2261\n\ndlnh\u03c1i\n,\ndlnhri\n\n(1)\n\nand we can extract the radial velocity distribution function (VDF) for each potential\nbin. We present the radial VDF for bins with \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122.6, \u22122 and \u22121.1 in the left panel\nof figure 2. The red (open) stars are from a bin in the region with shallow density slope\n(\u03b1 \u2248 \u22121.1), the green (open) squares are from an intermediate bin (slope close to \u22122),\nand the blue (filled) triangles are from a bin in the outer region (slope close to \u22122.6).\nThere seems to be a clear trend, namely that the VDF from bins in the inner region\nhave longer high energy tails than VDF's from bins in the outer region. On the same\nfigure have we overplotted 3 black (solid) lines, which have the shape\nfr (v) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)\n\n\u0012\n\nv\n\u03ba1 \u03c3rad\n\nq\n\u00132 ! 1\u2212q\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere q and \u03ba1 are free parameters. This is of the Tsallis form [15], and depends on\nthe entropic index q. This form reduces to the Gaussian shape f (v) \u223c exp(\u2212(v/v0 )2 )\nwhen q = 1. This functional form is chosen partly for simplicity (and because it includes\nthe classical exponential), and partly because some simple structures are know to have\nVDF's of exactly this form [16, 17]. The corresponding q's of these 3 lines in figure 2\nare 0.75, 0.81, 1.08, showing that the bin in the region with more shallow density slopes\n(with q = 1.08) has a longer high energy tail than a Gaussian. In particular do we see\nthat the resulting VDF's do not have the shape of Gaussians with a cut-off at the escape\nvelocity.\nThe shape of eq. (2) provides a reasonable fit to all the energy range only for\nthe most shallow profile, namely in the spatial region where the velocity dispersion is\nisotropic. In the regions with steeper density profile does the shape of eq. (2) only\nprovide a fit in the high energy region of the VDF, and in order to fully fit the radial\nVDF in the low energy region must one consider a more general shape. Detailed look at\nthe figures in fig. 2 reveals that the general radial VDF may be better fit with a more\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n5\n\nFigure 2. The radial VDF for 3 potential bins in the simulation of repeated headon\ncollisions between NFW structures with very different initial conditions. The potential\nbins are chosen near density slope of \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121.1 (open red stars), \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122 (open green\nsquares) and \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122.6 (filled blue triangles). The thin (solid) lines are of the shape\ngiven by eq. (2), using q's of 0.75, 0.81 and 1.08 (fig a); q = 0.79, 0.91 and 1.05 (fig b);\nand q = 0.75, 0.89 and 1.045. The similarity between these figures is striking.\n\nflat-topped (larger q) in the low energy region, and with a (small) q as described above\nfor the high energy region, however we will not pursue this issue further here.\nIt is worth commenting briefly on the definition of radial and tangential used in this\npaper. We are splitting the equilibrated structure in potential bins, which is because\nthe energy of each particle is composed of potential and kinetic energy. Since we wish to\nextract the VDF's, then we must consider potential bins and not radial bins, however,\nthe potential bins are virtually spherical in the outer region, and there is only a small\neffect in the central region. Now, we define \"radial\" strictly with respect to a spherical\nsymmetry. Clearly the splitting between radial and tangential will depend somewhat\non the actual shape of the structure considered: if the structure is very elongated, then\nthe concept of \"radial\" must be with respect to the shape of this structure. One can\nextract the shape from either density contours or from the potential energy contours,\nand the shape will be different (density contours are much more triaxial), and hence\nthe definition of \"radial\" depends on which kind of shape one is referring to. We will in\nthis paper, for simplicity, ignore this complication, and simply extract the radial with\nrespect to spherical symmetry. We hope to discuss this issue in full in a future analysis.\n2.1. Dependence on initial conditions?\nTo address the question of how strongly the VDF's from the head-on collisions described\nabove depend on the initial conditions, we now consider 2 simulations each with two\nsteps. i) First we create a spherical isotropic NFW structure with 1 million particles\nas described above. We take each individual particle in this structure and put its\ntotal velocity along the radial direction, maintaining the sign with respect to inwards or\noutwards from the halo centre. We keep the energy of each particle fixed. This structure\nis thus strongly radially anisotropic. ii) Now we take two such radially anisotropic\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n6\n\nstructures and place their centres 2000 kpc apart (well outside the virial radius) with\nrelative velocity of 100 km/sec towards each other. We use softening of 1 kpc for these\ntests. Before the centres of the two structures collide the radial motion of the particles\nbehaves almost like a radial infall simulation, and strong scattering of the particles is\nobserved. The 2 individual structures pick random orientations in space as they become\ntriaxial [18]; their orientations are completely erased after the two structures collide\nhead-on. We let the structure equilibrate. We take two copies of the resulting structure\nand collide these head-on, again with 100 km/sec. The final equilibrated region contains\napproximately 2.5 million particles (of the total of 4 million particles).\nThe resulting VDF's extracted in potential bins near density slopes of\n\u22122.3, \u22122, \u22121.2 are shown in the central panel of figure 2, and the black (solid) lines\nare again of the shape of eq. (2), with q's of 0.79, 0.91 and 1.05.\nSecond, we run a simulation identical to the one just described, except that we place\neach individual particle in the initial structures on tangential orbits, without changing\nthe energy of the individual particles. This initial condition thus corresponds to strongly\ntangential motion. When letting this structure equilibrate in isolation it settles down\nwith a tangential anisotropy of \u03b2 \u223c \u22122. Again, two such structures are collided headon. We again take two copies of the resulting structure and collide these headon. The\nresulting VDF's are shown in the right panel of figure 2, where the bins were chosen\nto be near density slope of \u22122.6, \u22122 and \u22121.15, and the black (solid) lines are of the\nshape eq. (2), with q's of 0.75, 0.89 and 1.045. One should keep in mind, that this last\nstructure was created with zero radial velocity, and hence the radial VDF was created\nwhile perturbing the structure and letting it relax.\nIt is clear from the figures above, that the simple shape of eq. (2) provides a\nreasonable fit to the tails of the radial VDF's. Furthermore, there seems to be a general\ntrend in the connection between density slope and the best fitting q, which is shown in\nfigure 3 as blue (solid) triangles.\nSuch a trend with shallower density slope implying larger q's was suggested from\nsimplified theoretical considerations [17]. It is interesting to note that ref. [19] found that\nthe radial VDF of the inner-most bin is fit with a Gaussian q = 1, and the intermediate\nbins can be fitted with q = 0.65, in reasonable agreement with our findings.\nFinally we consider simulated cosmological \u039bCDM haloes that form in a standard\nexpanding hierarchical universe, and we analyse these haloes in the same way as above.\nWe consider two relaxed halos, each with approximately 1/2 million particles in the\nequilibrated region. These are the two binary haloes taken from the Local Group\nsimulation of [20]. One of these haloes is strongly oblate, the other strongly prolate\nin density contours. We also perform a radial infall simulation with 1 million particles,\nand analyse the resulting structure as described above. We first present the density and\nphase-space density of the radial infall simulation as functions of radius (in simulation\nunits) in figure 4, from which it appears that using the total dispersion leads to a slightly\nbetter fit to a power-law in radius, since the residuals from a power-law is slightly sshaped when using \u03c3rad instead.\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n7\n\nFigure 3. The q's which best fit the high energy tail of the radial VDF's (blue\ntriangles) as a function of the density slope. The green (filled) pentagons are fitted from\nthe radial VDF's of a combination of cosmological simulations and a radial collapse\nsimulation. The red (open) stars are the q's which best fit the high energy tail of the\n2 dimensional tangential VDF. There is a general trend, namely that more shallow\nslopes are better fit with higher q.\n\nFor these 3 simulations we extract the VDF's in potential bins, and we present\nthese 3 simulations together in the left column of figure 5, where we are plotting the\nradial VDF for bins with density slope near \u22121.1, \u22122 and \u22122.6 respectively. Also in\nthese figures do we plot black (solid) lines of the form in eq. (2), using q's of 1.1, 0.9 and\n0.8 respectively. A potential bin near density slope of \u22122.6 has much larger scatter since\nthis region is not fully mixed in the cosmological runs. We present the corresponding\n\u03b1's and q's as green (filled) pentagons in figure 3, and we find good agreement with the\nresults from the controlled collisions.\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n8\n\nFigure 4. The density and phase-space density as functions of radius for the radial\ncollapse model. The black line in the left panel is of the NFW shape. Right panel: The\nsymbols are when using different dispersions (radial, tangential, total), and it appears\nthat using the total dispersion provides a slightly better fit to a power-law in radius.\nThe solid (thin) black lines are power-laws in radius, using powers of \u22121.9 (radial), 1.4\n(tangential), and \u22121.6 (total).\n\n3. Tangential VDF\nIn order to discuss the shape of the tangential VDF we now present the tangential VDF\nin 3 bins from each of the simulations described above. These are the same bins as\ndiscussed for the radial VDF, namely one bin in the outer region (near \u03b1 = \u22122.6), a\nbin near an intermediate slope (near \u03b1 = \u22122), and a bin near a shallow density slope\n(near \u03b1 = \u22121.1).\nThe first impression from the right column of figure 5 is that indeed all the tangential\nVDF's look very similar for these different simulations: the simulations with 4 million\nparticles which have been run for a very long time (red, blue and green symbols) lie\nvery close to each other, and the scatter in figure 5 is from the low resolution structures\nfrom the cosmological simulation (each with about 1/2 million particles) and the radial\ninfall simulation (with 1 million particles). This scatter is most visible for the bin near\na shallow profile (top panel) where there are relatively few particles.\nOne should keep in mind that the initial conditions for two of these simulations were\nwith all the particles on completely radial orbits, and therefore the tangential VDF's\nappear purely as a result of the structure being perturbed and setteling down in a stable\nconfiguration.\nWhen comparing figures 5 one sees another trend, namely that the high energy tail\nof the VDF becomes longer for more shallow density profile. This was exactly what we\nnoticed for the radial VDF above.\nThese are the 2-dimensional tangential VDF's, and for a classical gas they would\nhave had the shape ft \u223c v exp(\u2212v 2 /v02 ), where v0 is some normalizing velocity. We see\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n9\n\nFigure 5. Left column: The radial VDF's from a cosmological simulation (blue circles\nand red triangles) and a radial infall simulation (black squares). Row 1: The potential\nbins were chosen near density slope of \u03b1 = \u22121.1, and the black (solid) line is of the\nshape in eq. (2), using q = 1.1. Row 2: \u03b1 = \u22122, q = 0.9. Row 3: \u03b1 = \u22122.6, q = 0.8.\nRight column: The tangential VDF's from all the simulations discussed above.\nThe black (solid) line has two parts (separated at vtan = 1.6 \u03c3tan ), each fitted with the\nshape given in eq. (3), where the low energy part uses q = 5/3, and the outer region\n(high energy part) has a free q. Row 1: using a potential bin near the density slope\nof \u03b1 = \u22121.1, and the black (solid) line uses q = 0.9 in the high energy part. Row 2:\n\u03b1 = \u22122, q = 0.86. Row 3: \u03b1 = \u22122.6, q = 0.76.\n\n\f10\n\nA universal VDF\n\nclearly from the figures that they all have a rather characteristic break, somewhere near\nvtan = 2 \u03c3tan , and hence a Gaussian will give a very poor fit.\nWe are interested in making a phenomenological fit to the shape of these tangential\nVDF, and it is natural to consider the 2-dimensional generalization of eq. (2), namely\nft (v) = v\n\n1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)\n\n\u0012\n\nv\n\u03ba2 \u03c3rad\n\nq\n\u00132 ! 1\u2212q\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\nhowever, given the break near vtan = 2 \u03c3tan this is clearly not sufficient. We will therefore\nfit with two such shapes, one in the small velocity region, and another in the high velocity\nregion. It was argued in [7] that the tangential VDF's could have the shape of eq. (3)\nwith q = 5/3, and one sees immedeately that the small velocity region is very well fit\nwith exactly this shape for all the bins in potential. We pick the position vtan = 1.6 \u03c3tan\nas the transition velocity for all figures, and fit the high energy region with the shape\nof eq. (3), but with q a free parameter. The combined fit is shown as black (solid) lines\nin the 3 figures, and these provide a very good fit to the full VDF's. We are using q's of\n0.76, 0.86 and 0.9 (larger q corresponds to more shallow density profile). These results\nfor the high energy tail of the tangential VDF's are also shown in figure 3 as red (open)\nstars. Again there is a general trend showing that more shallow density profiles give\ntangential VDF's which have power-law tails given by larger q's.\n4. Full VDF\nHaving identified that both the radial and the tangential distribution functions have\nthe same universal shapes for different simulations, for potential bins which are at the\nsame value of the density slope, we can now also plot the full (3 dimensional) VDF.\nAlso cosmological simulations have considered the full VDF and found that a Gaussian\nin general does not give a good fit to the VDF [20, 21].\nA comment on the uniqueness of the connection between the VDF's and the density\nis in order at this point. The density is simply given as an integral over the full VDF,\nR\n\u03c1 = f d3 v, however, this is completely independent of the anisotropy. If the anisotropy\nis zero, then this equation can be inverted for spherical systems (by the Eddington\nmethod) to give the VDF as a function of the density profile. This inversion gives a\nunique VDF. However, for an anisotropic and non-spherical system this inversion is\nalmost certainly not unique, and it is therefore not obvious that the VDF should be\nuniversal between these different simulations. On a more philosophical note, one should\nkeep in mind that the individual particles are gravitationally scattered off each other\nwhile the structures are forming: the individual particles only feel the local particles\nand the local change of density and potential. It is therefore the VDF's which are\ntruely universal. The integrated quantities, namely density and anisotropy, are universal\nbecause of the universality of the VDF's. If we are ever going to truely understand the\nuniversality of density and anistropy, then we should take a step back and understand\nthe universality of the VDF's.\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n11\n\nInstead of plotting for all the simulations, we will only show the full VDF for one,\nnamely the repeated head-on collision between initially isotropic NFW structures. This\nis shown in figure 6, where the potential bins are chosen near density slope of \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121.1\n(open red circles), \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122 (open green squares) and \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122.6 (filled blue triangles).\n\nFigure 6. The total 3-dimensional VDF for 3 potential bins in the simulation of a\nrepeated headon collision between initially isotropic NFW structures. The potential\nbins are chosen near density slope of \u03b1 \u2248 \u22121.1 (open red circles), \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122 (open\ngreen squares) and \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122.6 (filled blue triangles). The solid lines which are shifted\ndownwards for visibility are from the isotropic NFW structure, and do not exhibit the\ndouble-hump.\n\nIn the spatially central region with shallow density profile there is zero anisotropy,\nand the full VDF can again be reasonably fitted by two functions of the shape\nftot = v 2 fr . This is shown with the dashed (black) line going through the red circles\n(using different q's in the high and low energy region, q1 \u2248 1.3, q2 \u2248 1). In the\nspatial regions with non-zero anisotropy the full VDF looks much more complicated,\nin particular, in regions with large anisotropy is develops a double-hump shape (see\nblue filled triangles in figure 6). For comparison we show the corresponding full VDF\nfrom the initial conditions of a stable NFW structure with zero anisotropy as solid\n\n\fA universal VDF\n\n12\n\nlines shifted downwards for visibility (regions corresponding to the same density slope\nas for the repeated head-on collision). These initial conditions clearly do not have the\ndouble-hump, since they are isotropic.\n5. Conclusions\nWe have identified a universality of the velocity distribution function (VDF) of\nequilibrated structures of collisionless, selfgravitating particles through a set of\ncontrolled numerical experiments. We find that the radial and tangential VDF are\nuniversal in the sense that they depend only on the dispersion (radial or tangential) and\nthe local slope of the density. This universality of the VDF is non-trivial, since the final\nstructures are not spherical and isotropic.\nOur simulations include controlled collision experiments between structures which\nare initially isotropic as well as highly anisotropic, radial infall collapse, and structures\nformed in cosmological simulations.\nThe high energy tail of the radial VDF is well approximated by the shape given in\neq. (2), however, for regions with non-zero anisotropy (steep density slopes) there are\ncorrections in the low-energy part of the VDF.\nThe tangential VDF is well described by a combination of two functions of the\nshape of eq. (3), where the low-energy part has q = 5/3, and the high-energy part has\na q similar to the one describing the radial VDF.\nWhereas the general trend, namely that steeper density slope implies small q,\nis in agreement with theoretical expectations, then the actual shape of the VDF's is\nnot understood yet. Our numerical results may hopefully inspire further theoretical\nunderstanding of the VDF of collisionless particles.\nAcknowledgments\nWe sincerely thank J\u00fcrg Diemand for pointing out an important mistake in an early\ndraft of this paper.
