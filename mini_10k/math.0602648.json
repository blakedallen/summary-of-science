WAGNER\nAbstract. Mason's Conjecture asserts\u0001 that for an m\u2013element\nrank r matroid M the sequence (Ik / m\n: 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) is logk\narithmically concave, in which Ik is the number of independent\nk\u2013sets of M.

This condition is known to hold for the set of bases of\na regular matroid. We show that if \u03c9 is a weight function on a\nset system Q that satisfies the Rayleigh condition then Q is a convex delta\u2013matroid and \u03c9 is logarithmically submodular. Thus, the\nhypothesis of the probabilistic conjecture leads inevitably to matroid theory. We also show that two\u2013sums of matroids preserve\nthe Rayleigh condition in four distinct senses, and hence that the\nPotts model of an iterated two\u2013sum of uniform matroids satisfies\nthe Rayleigh condition. Numerous conjectures and auxiliary results are included.\n\n1. Introduction.\nMason's Conjecture [28] is that the sequence (Ik : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) of\nnumbers of independent k\u2013sets of an m\u2013element rank r matroid\n\u0001 M is\nm\nlogarithmically concave in the strong sense (I-4) that (Ik / k : 0 \u2264\nk \u2264 r) is log\u2013concave. That is, that\nIk\u22121 Ik+1\nIk2\n\u0001 \u2265 m\u0001* m\u0001\nm 2\nk\n\nk\u22121\n\nk+1\n\nfor all 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r \u2212 1. A weaker form of the conjecture is (I-2) that the\nsequence (Ik : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) itself is log\u2013concave: Ik2 \u2265 Ik\u22121 Ik+1 for all\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 r \u2212 1. Mahoney [27] has shown that (I-2) holds for graphic\n(cycle) matroids of outerplanar graphs. Dowling [15] has shown the\ninequalities Ik2 \u2265 Ik\u22121 Ik+1 in general for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 7. Zhao [40] has\n\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. 05A20; 05B35, 60C05, 82B20.\nKey words and phrases. matroid, delta\u2013matroid, logarithmic concavity, Rayleigh\nmonotonicity, Potts model.\nResearch supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada under operating grant OGP0105392.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\nshown that Ik2 \u2265 (1 + 1/k)Ik\u22121Ik+1 in general for 1 \u2264 k \u2264 5. These are\ncurrently the most notable partial results on Mason's Conjecture.\nThere is a related conjecture in probability theory, but its origin\nis obscure. Pemantle [30] considers a lot of conditions of this kind.\nThe Big Conjecture 3.4 states that if \u03c9 : B(E) \u2192 [0, \u221e) is a nonnegative P\nweight function on a finite Boolean algebra B(E), and\u0001if\nfk (\u03c9) := S\u2286E: |S|=k \u03c9(S) for all 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m = |E| then (fk (\u03c9)/ m\n:\nk\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) is logarithmically concave, provided that \u03c9 satisfies something we call the Rayleigh condition. This condition is a strong pairwise\nnegative correlation property among random variables {Xe : e \u2208 E}\ncorresponding to the elements of the ground\u2013set E, with joint distribution function encoding the weight function \u03c9. The Rayleigh condition is known to hold in its weakest form (B\u2013Rayleigh, for bases)\nfor all regular (unimodular) matroids, and for many more [13]. There\nare more refined and informative versions of the Rayleigh condition for\nmatroids: I\u2013Rayleigh, S\u2013Rayleigh, and Potts\u2013Rayleigh for independent\nsets, spanning sets, and the Potts model, respectively.\nA positive solution to the Big Conjecture would be a very good thing.\nIf so, then every I\u2013Rayleigh matroid satisfies Mason's Conjecture (I-4).\nIn Section 5 we see that every series\u2013parallel matroid is I\u2013Rayleigh, and\nwe have reason to believe that the class of I\u2013Rayleigh matroids might\ncontain all graphs, maybe all regular matroids, perhaps even more.\nThus, this line of reasoning has the potential for substantial progress\non Mason's Conjecture.\nAlthough the Big Conjecture has not been proven we do have a new\nequivalent form of it, Conjecture 3.11, which states that if \u03c9 satisfies the\nRayleigh condition then its symmetrization \u03c9\ne also satisfies the Rayleigh\ncondition. By the exchangeable (symmetric function) case of the Big\nConjecture \u2013 that is, Proposition 3.6 \u2013 this implies the inequalities\non (fk (\u03c9)). This suggests an entirely different approach towards the\nrequired inequalities.\nIn Section 2 we briefly review some unimodality conditions for nonnegative real sequences, some sequences associated with matroids, and\nsome relevant unimodality conjectures and results. This is meant to\nput the results of later sections in context.\nIn Section 3 we look at some examples, state the Big Conjecture\n3.4, prove the exchangeable case Proposition 3.6 of it, and review some\nsupplementary results. This is also partly a capsule summary of some of\nSection 2.4 of Pemantle [30]. Then we give a new equivalent form of the\nBig Conjecture 3.11, and, after some algebra, the sufficient conditions\nConjectures 3.13 and 3.14. These latter two conjectures are more local\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n3\n\nthan 3.11, so even though they are strictly stronger they might be more\namenable to proof.\nIn Section 4 we show that if \u03c9 is Rayleigh then Supp(\u03c9), the set\nof sets on which \u03c9 is positive, is a convex delta\u2013matroid, and that \u03c9\nis logarithmically submodular. Regarding the conjectures of Section 2\nthis is a negative result: the Big Conjecture is directly relevant only to\nMason's Conjecture (I-4). On the other hand, this structure might be\nuseful in an attempt to prove the Big Conjecture.\nIn Section 5 we turn to finding examples to populate the theory.\nWe see that uniform matroids are Potts\u2013Rayleigh. We show that the\nRayleigh condition on the Potts model partition function is preserved\nby two\u2013sums of matroids. Consequently, every series\u2013parallel matroid\nis Potts\u2013Rayleigh. Analogously, two\u2013sums preserve the Rayleigh condition for matroids in any of the three frozen senses: for bases, for independent sets, or for spanning sets. Concerning the I\u2013Rayleigh property\nfor graphs we have a few small examples and two relatively technical\nconjectures. CJSSS [9] gives the generating function for the set of\nspanning forests of a graph as a Grassmann\u2013Berezin integral. This is a\nbeautiful result, and can only help any attempt to prove that graphs are\nI\u2013Rayleigh. As an adjunct to the Big Conjecture 3.4 we give a related\nscale of Conjectures 5.11, guessing that various classes of matroids are\nI\u2013Rayleigh. Some binary matroids fail to be balanced [34], but within\nthe class of sixth\u2013root\u2013of\u2013unity matroids there are no show\u2013stoppers\nin sight. They might all be Potts\u2013Rayleigh! The relationship between\nthe Potts\u2013Rayleigh condition and the half\u2013plane property (HPP) is unclear \u2013 my guess is for counterexamples both ways. There is still very\nlittle data to go on, and many interesting examples are sure to be as\nyet undiscovered.\nIn preparing this paper I have benefitted from conversations and correspondence with many people. In particular I thank Andr\u00e9 Bouchet,\nSeth Chaiken, Bill Cunningham, Jim Geelen, Bill Jackson, Tom Liggett,\nRobin Pemantle, and Alan Sokal for their comments.

Logarithmic Concavity Conjectures for Matroids.\n2.1. unimodality conditions.\nLet 0 \u2264 s \u2264 r \u2264 m be integers, and let as , as+1 , . . . , ar be a finite sequence of nonnegative real numbers. Consider the following conditions\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\non this sequence a = (ak : s \u2264 k \u2264 r):\n(a-0) no internal zeros: if s \u2264 i < j < k \u2264 r and ai ak 6= 0, then aj 6= 0;\n(a-1) unimodality: as \u2264 as+1 \u2264 * * * \u2264 ap \u2265 * * * \u2265 ar for some s \u2264 p \u2264 r;\n(a-2) logarithmic concavity: a2k \u2265 ak\u22121 ak+1 for all s + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 r \u2212 1;\n(a-3) logarithmic concavity of the sequence (k!ak : \u0001s \u2264 k \u2264 r);\n(a-4) logarithmic concavity of the sequence (ak / m\n: s \u2264 k \u2264 r);\nk\u0001\nr\n(a-5) logarithmic concavity of the sequence (ak / k : s \u2264 k \u2264 r);\n(a-6) the polynomial as + as+1 t + * * * + ar tr has only real (nonpositive)\nzeros.\nElementary arguments show that (a-5) =\u21d2 (a-4) =\u21d2 (a-3) =\u21d2 (a-2),\nand that (a-2) and (a-0) together imply (a-1). Newton's Inequalities\n(item (51) of [20]) assert that (a-6) implies both (a-5) and (a-0). The\nsequences we consider are usually easily seen to satisfy (0).\n2.2. sequences associated with matroids.\nLet M be a loopless matroid of rank r on a set E of size |E| = m.\nSeveral sequences associated with M have been conjectured to satisfy\none or another of the above conditions. In most cases counterexamples\nto condition (5) can be found easily, so condition (4) is the strongest\nreasonable conjecture.\n(Wk : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) in which Wk is the number of flats of M of\nrank k. Unimodality (W-1) was conjectured by Rota [32] in the late\n1960s, and logarithmic concavity in any of the forms (W-2) to (W-4)\nwas conjectured by Mason [28] in the early 1970s. Seymour [33] has\nshown that W22 \u2265 W1 W3 for matroids with at most four points on any\nline.\n(Ik : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) in which Ik is the number of independent sets of\nM of size k. Unimodality (I-1) was conjectured by Welsh [39] in the\nlate 1960s, and logarithmic concavity in any of the forms (I-2) to (I-4)\nwas conjectured by Mason [28] in the early 1970s. Partial results were\nreviewed in the first paragraph of the Introduction. If Conjecture 3.4\nis true then every series\u2013parallel graph satisfies (I-4), which would be\nprogress.\n(\u03c7k : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) in which \u03c7k is the number of subsets of E of\nsize k containing no broken circuit of M (relative to any fixed total\norder on E). For graphic matroids these are the coefficients of the\nchromatic polynomial of the graph. Unimodality (\u03c7-1) was conjectured\nby Read [31] in the late 1960s (for graphs), and logarithmic concavity\nin the form (\u03c7-2) was conjectured by Hoggar [21] in the early 1970s\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n5\n\n(also for graphs). The literature on zeros or coefficients of chromatic\npolynomials is extensive - see [7, 23, 31, 35] for starters.\n(hk : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) in which the integers hk are defined by the relation\nr\nr\nX\nX\nk\nhk xk (1 + x)r\u2212k .\nIk t =\nk=0\n\nk=0\n\nThe properties (h-1) to (h-4) were conjectured for this sequence by\nDawson [14] in the early 1980s. Dawson\nproves that (h-2,0) implies\n\u0001\nm\n(I-2,0), and that the sequence (hk / k : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) is nonincreasing.\nFix any E \u2032 \u2286 E and consider (ck : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 r) in which ck is the\nnumber of bases B of M such that |B \u2229 E \u2032 | = k. Condition (c-5)\nwas proven by Stanley [36] and condition (c-6) by Godsil [19] in the\nearly 1980s, both for the class of regular matroids. Condition (c-6)\nwas proven recently for the larger class of HPP matroids by Choe and\nWagner [13]; see also [12, 38]. Does the B\u2013Rayleigh condition imply\n(c-2)?\nIt must be said that conjectures (\u03c7-1) and (h-1) now seem dubious in the generality of all matroids. Even (I-1) seems a little suspect\nsince Bj\u00f6rner [2, 3] has given counterexamples to (I-1) and (h-1) in the\nsomewhat wider arena of shellable simplicial complexes. But we are\nnot asking for universal results \u2013 rather, just for the identification of\nsignificant classes of matroids (or related objects) satisfying more\u2013or\u2013\nless restrictive versions of these unimodality conditions.\n2.3. from integer sequences to polynomials.\nFor a loopless matroid M on a set E and a set m = {me : e \u2208 E} of\npositive integers indexed by E, let M[m] be the matroid obtained from\nM by replacing each e \u2208 E by me elements in parallel. The number of\nk\u2013element independent sets of M[m] is\nX\nY\nIk (M[m]) =\nme ,\nS\u2208IM: |S|=k\n\ne\u2208S\n\nin which IM is the simplicial complex of independent sets of M. Considering the conjectures about (Ik ) for all of these matroids at the same\ntime, we are led to consider properties of the polynomial\nX Y\nye ,\nZ(IM; y) :=\nS\u2208IM\n\ne\u2208S\n\nin which y = {ye : e \u2208 E} is a set of algebraically\nindependent\nQ\nS\ncommuting indeterminates.

Negatively Correlated Random Variables.\n3.1. partition functions and the rayleigh condition.\nFor our purposes it suffices to consider finite sets of binary (zero or\none) valued random variables.\nLet E be a finite set with |E| = m, let B(E) be the set of all subsets\nof E, and let \u03c9 : B(E) \u2192 [0, \u221e) be a nonnegative\u2013valued function on\nB(E) that is not identically zero. Let y := {ye : e \u2208 E} be a set of\nalgebraically independent commuting indeterminates, and consider the\npartition function\nX\nZ(\u03c9; y) :=\n\u03c9(S)yS .\nS\u2286E\n\nFor any choice of positive values ye > 0 for each e \u2208 E, this determines\na probability measure \u03bc = \u03bcy on B(E) by setting\n\u03bc(S) :=\n\n\u03c9(S)yS\nZ(\u03c9; y)\n\nfor all S \u2286 E. The atomic random variables of this theory are Xe for\neach e \u2208 E, given by\n\u001a\n1 if e \u2208 S,\nXe (S) :=\n0 if e 6\u2208 S.\nThe expectation of a random variable X is\nX\nhXi :=\nX(S)\u03bc(S).\nS\u2286E\n\nThe covariance of two random variables X and Y is\nCov(X, Y ) := hXY i \u2212 hXihY i.\nThe hypothesis we put on the weight function \u03c9 is the following:\nfor any positive choice of parameters y > 0, and any distinct e 6= f\nin E, Cov(Xe , Xf ) \u2264 0. As a short codename for this hypothesis, we\nwill say that the weight function \u03c9 or the partition function Z(\u03c9; y)\nsatisfies the Rayleigh condition; even more briefly, we will say that \u03c9 or\nZ is Rayleigh. The reason for this terminology is by analogy with the\nRayleigh monotonicity property of (linear resistive) electrical networks.\nThat is (with the notation of Example 3.1) that BG is Rayleigh for a\ngraphic matroid G. In fact, BM is Rayleigh for a much wider class of\nmatroids than the regular ones [11, 12, 13, 37, 38].\nThe following three examples define classes of weight functions \u03c9 for\nwhich the question \"Is \u03c9 Rayleigh?\" seems interesting.\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n7\n\nExample 3.1. Let Q \u2286 B(E) be any set system, and define 1Q :\nB(E) \u2192 [0, \u221e) by\n\u001a\n1 if S \u2208 Q,\n1Q(S) :=\n0 if S 6\u2208 Q.\nThe corresponding partition function Z(1Q; y) will be denoted more\nsimply by Z(Q; y). In particular, for a matroid M we consider this\nconstruction with Q being any of:\nthe set BM of bases of M,\nthe set IM of independent sets of M,\nthe set SM of spanning sets of M.\nExample 3.2. For a matroid M of rank r on the ground set E, and\nreal q > 0, define \u03c9 : B(E) \u2192 (0, \u221e) by\n\u03c9(S) := q \u2212rankM (S) .\n\nDenote the corresponding partition function by Z(M, q; y). It is the\npartition function of the q\u2013state Potts model associated with the matroid M. The set systems of Example 3.1 are limiting cases of this\nexample, as follows. Fix 0 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1 and consider the substitution\nq (1\u2212\u03b1)r Z(M, q; q \u03b1y). For S \u2286 E(M), the coefficient of yS in this is q to\nthe power\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1)(r \u2212 rankM(S)) + \u03b1(|S| \u2212 rankM(S)).\n\nThis exponent is nonnegative for all S \u2286 E(M). As q \u2192 0 only those\nterms in which the exponent is zero survive. Thus\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 Z(SM; y) if \u03b1 = 0,\nZ(BM; y) if 0 < \u03b1 < 1,\nlim q (1\u2212\u03b1)r Z(M, q; q \u03b1 y) =\nq\u21920\n\uf8f3\nZ(IM; y) if \u03b1 = 1.\nSee Sokal [35] for an excellent survey of the combinatorial and analytic\nproperties of Potts model partition functions. Limiting arguments can\nbe used to show that if Z(M, q; y) is Rayleigh for all q in an interval\n0 < q \u2264 q\u2217 (M) then both IM and SM are Rayleigh, and that if either\nIM or SM is Rayleigh then BM is Rayleigh.\n\nExample 3.3. A nonsingular M\u2013matrix is a square real symmetric\nmatrix for which all principal minors are positive and all off\u2013diagonal\nelements are nonpositive. If either A or A\u22121 is a nonsingular M\u2013matrix\nwith rows and columns indexed by E, define \u03c9A : B(E) \u2192 (0, \u221e) by\nputting \u03c9A (S) equal to the minor of A indexed by rows and columns\nin S, for every S \u2286 E. (By Jacobi's formula for complementary minors\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\nof inverse matrices, this is possible.) With the notation of Conjecture\n3.4, Holtz [22] has recently proven (f-4,0) for such \u03c9A .\n3.2. the big conjecture.\nConjecture 3.4. Let Z(\u03c9; y) satisfy the Rayleigh condition.

But the hypothesis is unchanged by\nrescaling ye = we ze for each e \u2208 E. Considering Z(\u03c9; wz) as a polynomial in z, the Big Conjecture implies (f(w)-4,0) for all w > 0. Thus,\nnothing is gained.\nNote also that Proposition 4.7(a) implies that if Z(\u03c9; y) is Rayleigh\nthen (fk (\u03c9) : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) has no internal zeros, the condition (f-0).\nSince Proposition 4.7 is derived independently of the results of this\nsection we may make use of it here.\nIf Conjecture 3.4 is true then any matroid M for which IM is Rayleigh\nsatisfies Mason's conjecture (I-4).\nIn light of Example 3.3, for which \u03c9 is it possible to find a symmetric matrix A with principal minors {\u03c9(S) : S \u2286 E} and off\u2013diagonal\nentries of A\u22121 equal to Cov(Xe , Xf ) for all e 6= f in E?\nHere are some formulae to keep in mind regarding the covariances\nfor an arbitrary partition function Z(\u03c9;\ny).

WAGNER\n\nThis extends to doubly\u2013infinite sequences of indeterminates aj and bk .\nA variety of finiteness or convergence conditions can then be applied.\nThe next result implies the exchangeable case of Conjecture 3.4, and\nadds to the equivalent conditions of Theorem 2.7 of Pemantle [30].\nProposition 3.6. For 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m, let ek (y) be the k\u2013th elementary\nsymmetric function of y = {y1 , . . . , ym }. Consider\nZ(y) = a0 e0 (y) + a1 e1 (y) + * * * + am em (y),\nin which the ak are nonnegative real numbers. The following are equivalent:\n(a) the polynomial Z(y) satisfies the Rayleigh condition;\n(b) the sequence (ak : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) is logarithmically concave with no\ninternal zeros, the condition (a-2,0);\n(c) \u2206Z{1, 2} is a positive linear combination of Schur functions;\n(d) \u2206Z{1, 2} is a positive linear combination of monomial symmetric\nfunctions.\nProof. First, to prove that (a) implies (b), assume that Z(y) satisfies\nthe Rayleigh condition. Fix 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m \u2212 1. For t > 0 let yi = t\u22121 for\n1 \u2264 i \u2264 k \u2212 1 and yj = t for k + 2 \u2264 j \u2264 m. Then, as t \u2192 0,\ntk\u22121 Z(y) \u2192 ak\u22121 + ak (yk + yk+1) + ak+1 yk yk+1.\n\nSince Z satisfies the Rayleigh condition, the inequality \u2206Z{k, k + 1} \u2265\n0 for all t > 0 implies that a2k \u2265 ak\u22121 ak+1 . Proposition 4.7(a) implies\nthat (a-0) holds.\nNext, to prove that (b) implies (c), assume that the sequence (ak :\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) is logarithmically concave with no internal zeros. With\nthe notation of Lemma 3.5, if bk = ek (y3 , ..., ym ) then\nZ12 (y) = Z21 (y) = c1 and Z12 (y) = c2 and Z 12 (y) = c0 .\nThus, by Lemma 3.5,\n\u2206Z{1, 2} = Z12 Z21 \u2212 Z12 Z 12 = c21 \u2212 c0 c2\nX\n=\n[aj+1 ak+1 \u2212 aj ak+2 ] [bj bk \u2212 bj\u22121 bk+1 ] .\n0\u2264j\u2264k\n\nThe factor aj+1 ak+1 \u2212 aj ak+2 is nonnegative by the hypothesis of logarithmic concavity with no internal zeros. The factor bj bk \u2212 bj\u22121 bk+1 is,\nby the Jacobi\u2013Trudy formula, the Schur function of shape [2j 1k\u2212j ] in\nthe quantities {y3 , ..., ym }.\nTo see that (c) implies (d), one need only note that Schur functions\nare positive linear combinations of monomial symmetric functions.\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n11\n\nFinally, if (d) holds then \u2206Z{1, 2} is nonnegative for all y > 0.\nSince Z is a symmetric function this suffices to verify (a) that Z is\nRayleigh.\n\u0003\nIn general, the difference \u2206Z{e, f } might have negative coefficients,\neven though Z is Rayleigh. This happens for example when Z =\nZ(BK4 ; y) and e, f \u2208 E(K4 ) are non\u2013adjacent edges. See Example 5.2\nand Conjectures 5.3 and 5.4.\n3.3. supplementary remarks on the big conjecture.\nConjecture 3.4 is implied by the conjunction of two others. Partition\nE = E1 \u222aE2 with E1 \u2229E2 = \u2205. For i = 1, 2 let A\u2032i be an upward\u2013closed\nsubset of B(Ei ), and let\nAi := {S \u2286 E : S \u2229 Ei \u2208 A\u2032i }.\n\nThis defines two increasing events A1 and A2 with disjoint support.\nConjecture 3.7. Let Z(\u03c9; y) satisfy the Rayleigh condition. Then for\nall y > 0, and for all pairs of increasing events A1 , A2 with disjoint\nsupport,\nh1A1 \u2229A2 i \u2264 h1A1 i * h1A2 i.\nThis says that pairwise negative correlations (in the strong sense\nof the Rayleigh condition) imply negative correlations for all pairs of\nincreasing events with disjoint support. This stronger negative correlation property is known as negative association of the variables\n{Xe : e \u2208 E}, or of their partition function.\nThe following important result is due to Feder and Mihail [16]; also\nsee Theorem 6.5 of Lyons [26] and Theorem 1.3 of Pemantle [30].\nTheorem 3.8. If Z(\u03c9; y) is Rayleigh and homogeneous then it is negatively associated for all y > 0.\nConjecture 3.9.\n\u0001 Let Z(\u03c9; y) be negatively associated for all y > 0.\nThen (fk (\u03c9)/ m\n: 0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) is logarithmically concave with no\nk\ninternal zeros, the condition (f-4,0).\nAllowing the y > 0 to vary independently is essential for Conjecture\n3.4, as the following example shows.\nExample 3.10. For \u03b3 \u2265 0, let\n\nZ(t) = 1 + 12t + 60t2 + 20\u03b3t3 + 60t4 + 12t5 + t6 .\n\nThis sequence of coefficients (fk ) satisfies (f-4) if and only if 4 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 8,\n(f-2) if and only if 3 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 15, (f-1) if and only if \u03b3 \u2265 3, and (f-0) if and\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\nonly if \u03b3 > 0. For an exchangeable set of binary variables {X1 , . . . , X6 }\nwith this partition function Z(t), all pairwise correlations are the\n\u221a same\nas for X1 and X2 . A short calculation yields that if 2.61725 \u2248 6.85 \u2264\n\u03b3 \u2264 8 then \u2206Z{1, 2} is a polynomial with nonnegative coefficients,\nand hence is nonnegative for all t > 0. Thus, for \u03b3 in this range Z(t)\nsatisfies a restricted form of the Rayleigh condition (the form in which\nall ye = t are equal). But when \u03b3 = 2.9, for example, the unimodality\ncondition (f-1) does not hold. Thus, in Conjecture 3.4, it is essential\nthat the y > 0 be allowed to vary at least somewhat independently.\n3.4. an equivalent form of the big conjecture.\nTo reduce the general case to the exchangeable case consider the\ne acting on a partition function Z(\u03c9; y)\nsymmetrizing operator Z 7\u2192 Z,\nof m variables y1 , ..., ym by\nX\ne y) := 1\nZ(e\n\u03c9 ; y) := Z(\u03c9;\nZ(\u03c9; y\u03c3 ),\nm!\n\u03c3\u2208Sm\n\nthe sum being over all permutations\nQ \u03c3 in the symmetric group Sm (on\nthe set E indexing y), and y\u03c3S := e\u2208S y\u03c3(e) for all S \u2286 E.\u0001 Calculation\nreveals that for all S \u2286 E with |S| = k, \u03c9\ne (S) = fk (\u03c9)/ m\n.

A set\u2013system Q is weakly Rayleigh\nif there is some nonnegative weight function \u03c9 with support equal to\nQ such that Z(\u03c9; y) meets the Rayleigh condition.\nLemma 4.1. Let Q \u2286 B(E) be a (weakly) Rayleigh set\u2013system.\n(a) For all g \u2208 E, both Qg and Qg are (weakly) Rayleigh.\n(b) The dual Q\u2217 is (weakly) Rayleigh.\nProof. Let Z(\u03c9; y) be a polynomial with support Q. To prove part (a),\nfor distinct e, f, g \u2208 E, a short calculation shows that\n\u2206Z{e, f } = \u2206Z g {e, f } + yg \u0398Z{e, f |g} + yg2\u2206Zg {e, f }\n\nfor some polynomial \u0398Z{e, f |g}. Taking limits as yg \u2192 0 or as yg \u2192 \u221e\nshows that if Z meets the Rayleigh condition then so do Z g and Zg . If\n\u03c9 = 1Q then Qg and Qg are Rayleigh as well.\nFor part (b) one calculates that for e, f \u2208 E,\n\u2206Z \u2217 {e, f }(y) = (yE )2 \u2206Z{e, f }(1/y),\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\nfrom which the result follows.\n\n15\n\n\u0003\n\nTheorem 4.2. Let Q \u2286 B(E) be a weakly Rayleigh set\u2013system. If\n{\u2205, E} \u2286 Q then Q = B(E).\nProof. Let Z(\u03c9; y) be a polynomial with support Q that meets the\nRayleigh condition.\nWe proceed by induction on |E| = m. The bases m = 0 or m = 1\nare trivial. For the case m = 2 let E = {e, f }, so that Z has the form\nZ = A + Bye + Cyf + Dye yf\nfor nonnegative constants A, B, C, D with A and D positive. Since Z\nis Rayleigh the inequality BC \u2265 AD holds, so that both B and C are\npositive as well. Hence Q = B(E) in this case.\nFor the induction step we assume that m \u2265 2. Arguing for a contradiction, suppose that S \u2282 E is such that S 6\u2208 Q. (So, in particular,\nS 6\u2208 {\u2205, E}.) If there is a subset \u2205 \u2282 T \u2282 S such that T \u2208 Q then\nthe interval [T, E] of B(E) is a smaller Boolean algebra, and the contraction QT is weakly Rayleigh by Lemma 4.1(a). By the induction\nhypothesis, S r T \u2208 QT , so that S \u2208 Q, a contradiction. Therefore,\nQ \u2229 [\u2205, S] = {\u2205}. Thus, there is an element e \u2208 S such that {e} 6\u2208 Q.\nNow, if e \u2208 T \u2282 E then T 6\u2208 Q; for if it were the case that T \u2208 Q then\nthe fact that the deletion QErT is Rayleigh by Lemma 4.1(a) and the\ninduction hypothesis imply that {e} \u2208 Q. Thus, Q \u2229 [{e}, E] = {E}.\nTherefore Z(\u03c9; y) has the form Z = Z e + KyE for some constant\nK > 0. Since m \u2265 2 there is some f \u2208 E r {e}. Now Qfe = \u2205 and\nboth Qef 6= \u2205 and Qef 6= \u2205, so that \u2206Z{e, f } < 0 for every y > 0.\nThis contradicts the hypothesis that Z(\u03c9; y) is Rayleigh, completing\nthe induction step and the proof.\n\u0003\nA set\u2013system Q is convex if it satisfies the condition that for any\nS \u2286 T \u2286 S \u2032 \u2286 E, if S, S \u2032 \u2208 Q then T \u2208 Q.\nCorollary 4.3. Every weakly Rayleigh set\u2013system is convex.\nProof. Let Q \u2286 B(E) be a weakly Rayleigh set\u2013system. If S \u2286 T \u2286\n\u2032\nS \u2032 with S, S \u2032 \u2208 Q then consider the set\u2013system (QS )ErS . This is\nweakly Rayleigh by Lemma 4.1(a), and contains both \u2205 and S \u2032 r S.\n\u2032\nBy Theorem 4.2, T r S is in (QS )ErS , so that T is in Q.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.4. If \u03c9 : B(E) \u2192 [0, \u221e) is Rayleigh then \u03c9 is logarithmically submodular: for all S, T \u2208 B(E),\n\u03c9(S)\u03c9(T ) \u2265 \u03c9(S \u2229 T )\u03c9(S \u222a T ).\n\n\f16\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\nProof. By the m = 2 case of the proof of Theorem 4.2, this inequality\nholds whenever S \u2229 T is covered by both S and T . It holds trivially if\neither of S \u2229 T or S \u222a T is not in Supp(\u03c9), so assume otherwise. By\nCorollary 4.3, the interval [S \u2229 T, S \u222a T ] is contained in Supp(\u03c9). Let\nS \u2229 T = S0 \u2282 S1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Sk = S\n\nand\n\nS \u2229 T = T0 \u2282 T1 \u2282 * * * \u2282 Tl = T\nbe saturated chains in B(E). By the above remarks, for all 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k\nand 1 \u2264 j \u2264 l,\n\u03c9(Si \u222a Tj\u22121 )\u03c9(Si\u22121 \u222a Tj ) \u2265 \u03c9(Si\u22121 \u222a Tj\u22121 )\u03c9(Si \u222a Ti ).\n\nTaking the product of all these inequalities and cancelling the common\nfactors (which are strictly positive), we obtain\nThat is\nas desired.\n\n\u03c9(Sk \u222a T0 )\u03c9(S0 \u222a Tl ) \u2265 \u03c9(S0 \u222a T0 )\u03c9(Sk \u222a Tl ).\n\u03c9(S)\u03c9(T ) \u2265 \u03c9(S \u2229 T )\u03c9(S \u222a T ),\n\n\u0003\n\nInterestingly, the choice of saturated chains in this proof is arbitrary\nand disappears in the answer.\n4.2. exchange properties of the support.\nLemma 4.5. Let Q \u2286 B(E) be a weakly Rayleigh set\u2013system, and let\nA, B \u2208 Q with A \u2229 B = \u2205. For every {e, f } \u2286 B and g \u2208 A, at least\none of the sets Qfeg or Qef g is not empty.\nProof. Let Z(\u03c9; y) be a Rayleigh polynomial with support Q, and suppose that the conclusion fails to hold. Let {e, f } \u2286 B and g \u2208 A be\nsuch that both Qfeg and Qef g are empty. Then, in \u2206Z{e, f } the indeterminate yg does not occur in the term Zef Zfe . However, the pair (A, B)\ncontributes yA yB to the term Z ef Zef , so the indeterminate yg occurs\nin this term. No matter what values yc > 0 are chosen for all c 6= g,\nas yg \u2192 \u221e, \u2206Z{e, f } \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This contradicts the hypothesis that Z\nmeets the Rayleigh condition, completing the proof.\n\u0003\nA delta\u2013matroid is a set\u2013system Q \u2286 B(E) that satisfies the following\nsymmetric exchange axiom:\n(SEA) if A, B \u2208 Q and e \u2208 A\u25b3B, then there is an f \u2208 A\u25b3B such\nthat A\u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Q.\n(Here \u25b3 denotes the symmetric difference of sets.) Notice that Q is\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n17\n\na delta\u2013matroid if and only if Q\u2217 is a delta\u2013matroid. A good deal of\nmatroid theory generalizes well to delta\u2013matroids; see [4, 5, 6, 17, 18]\nfor starters.\nTheorem 4.6. Every weakly Rayleigh set\u2013system is a convex delta\u2013\nmatroid.\nProof. Let Z(\u03c9; y) be a polynomial with support Q that meets the\nRayleigh condition. That Q is convex has been established in Corollary\n4.3. The strategy of the proof is along the lines of [11, 12].\nWe verify that Q is a delta\u2013matroid by induction on the size |E| = m\nof the underlying set. The base cases m \u2264 2 are trivial, so assume that\nm \u2265 3. By Lemma 4.1(a) and the induction hypothesis, for any g \u2208 E\nthe set systems Qg and Qg are convex delta\u2013matroids.\nNow consider any A, B \u2208 Q and e \u2208 A\u25b3B. To verify the SEA for\n(A, B, e) in Q, we must find an element f \u2208 A\u25b3B such that A\u25b3{e, f } \u2208\nQ. If A\u25b3{e} \u2208 Q then we can choose f = e to satisfy the SEA, so we\nare left with the case that A\u25b3{e} 6\u2208 Q.\nIf g \u2208 A \u2229 B then consider the sets A\u2032 := A r {g} and B \u2032 := B r {g}\nin Qg , and the element e \u2208 A\u2032 \u25b3B \u2032 . By the SEA for (A\u2032 , B \u2032 , e) in Qg ,\nthere is an element f \u2208 A\u2032 \u25b3B \u2032 such that A\u2032 \u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Qg . This is an\nelement f \u2208 A\u25b3B such that A\u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Q. Thus, we can assume that\nA \u2229 B = \u2205.\nIf g \u2208 E r (A \u222a B) then consider the sets A and B in Qg , and the\nelement e \u2208 A\u25b3B. By the SEA for (A, B, e) in Qg , there is an element\nf \u2208 A\u25b3B such that A\u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Qg . This is an element f \u2208 A\u25b3B\nsuch that A\u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Q. Thus, we can assume that A \u222a B = E.\nNow, if A = \u2205 then B = E, while if B = \u2205 then A = E. In either\ncase, since Q is convex, Q = B(E). Since B(E) is a delta\u2013matroid we\ncan assume that both A and B are nonempty. Since |E| = m \u2265 3, one\nof the sets A or B has at least two elements. By Lemma 4.5 there is a\nthird set C \u2208 Q such that A \u2229 C 6= \u2205 and B \u2229 C 6= \u2205.\nFrom this point on we resort to a case analysis based on the two\nmain cases e \u2208 A or e \u2208 B, and on several subcases.\nCase I: e \u2208 A.\nSubcase (i): e \u2208 A r C.\nLet g \u2208 A \u2229 C, and consider A\u2032 := A r {g} and C \u2032 := C r {g} in\nQg . By the SEA for (A\u2032 , C \u2032 , e) in Qg , there is an f \u2208 A\u2032 \u25b3C \u2032 such that\nA\u2032 \u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Qg . Since A\u2032 \u25b3C \u2032 \u2286 A\u25b3B, this is an element f \u2208 A\u25b3B\nsuch that A\u25b3{e, f } \u2208 Q. This verifies the SEA for (A, B, e) in Q in\nthis subcase.\nSubcase (ii): e \u2208 A \u2229 C and |A \u2229 C| \u2265 3.\nLet g \u2208 B \u2229 C, so that C \u2032 := C r {g} and B \u2032 := B r {g} are in Qg .\n\n\f18\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\nBy the SEA for (C \u2032 , B \u2032 , e) in Qg , there is an f \u2208 C \u2032 \u25b3B \u2032 such that\nC \u2032 \u25b3{e, f } is in Qg . Thus, C \u2032\u2032 := C\u25b3{e, f } is in Q. Now e \u2208 A r C \u2032\u2032 ,\nand g \u2208 B \u2229 C \u2032\u2032 , and since |A \u2229 C| \u2265 3 it follows that |A \u2229 C \u2032\u2032 | \u2265 1.\nThus, C \u2032\u2032 is a set with the properties of C in subcase I(i), reducing\nsubcase I(ii) to that previously solved subcase.\nSubcase (iii): e \u2208 A \u2229 C and |A \u2229 C| = 2.\nRepeating the argument for subcase I(ii) produces a set C \u2032\u2032 with the\nproperties of C in subcase I(i) except when A \u2229 C = {e, f }, in which\ncase C \u2032\u2032 := C\u25b3{e, f } is disjoint from A. But then [C \u2032\u2032 , C] \u2286 Q since Q\nis convex, and it follows that C \u2032\u2032\u2032 := C r {e} \u2208 Q. Now this C \u2032\u2032\u2032 is a set\nlike C in subcase I(i), reducing subcase I(iii) to that previously solved\nsubcase.\nSubcase (iv): A \u2229 C = {e}.\nIf |A| \u2265 2 and |B| \u2265 2 then this case can be avoided as follows: for\nany g \u2208 A r {e}, Lemma 4.5 can be used to ensure that the particular\nelement g is contained in C, so that one of the subcases I(i,ii,iii) holds\ninstead. Thus, we can assume that either |A| = 1 or |B| = 1.\nIf A = {e} then |B| \u2265 2, and [{e}, C] \u2286 Q since Q is convex. Thus\nwe can assume that |C| = 2, so let C = {e, g} with g \u2208 B. If {g} \u2208 Q\nthen A\u25b3{e, g} = {g} \u2208 Q suffices to verify the SEA for (A, B, e) in Q,\nso we can assume that {g} 6\u2208 Q. Applying the SEA to ({e}, B r {g}, e)\nin Qg , there is an f \u2208 B r {g} such that {f, g} \u2208 Q. If {f } \u2208 Q then\nA\u25b3{e, f } = {f } \u2208 Q suffices to verify the SEA for (A, B, e) in Q, so we\ncan assume that {f } 6\u2208 Q. Now let R := Q \u2229 B({e, f, g}). The partition\npolynomial for the restriction of \u03c9 to R has the form\nZ|R = Ke ye + Kef ye yf + Keg ye yg + Kf g yf yg + Kef g ye yf yg\nfor nonnegative constants KS with Ke , Keg , and Kf g positive. (Note\nthat \u2205 6\u2208 R since \u2205 = A\u25b3{e} 6\u2208 Q.) This is Rayleigh, by Lemma\n4.1(a). The Rayleigh difference of f and g in Z|R is\n\u2206Z|R{f, g} = Kef Keg ye2 \u2212 Ke ye (Kf g + Kef g ye )\n\n= (Kef Keg \u2212 Ke Kef g )ye2 \u2212 Ke Kf g ye .\n\nThis quantity can be made negative by taking ye > 0 to be sufficiently\nsmall, contradicting the fact that Z|R is Rayleigh. Thus this part of\nthe subcase does not arise, completing the proof of subcase I(iv) when\n|A| = 1.\nIf |B| = 1 then |A| \u2265 2. Let B = {g}, so that C = {e, g}. Applying\nthe SEA to ({g}, A r {e}, g) in Qe , either {e} \u2208 Q or there is an\nh \u2208 A r {e} such that {e, h} \u2208 Q. If {e} \u2208 Q then [{e}, A] \u2286 Q since\nQ is convex; thus we can assume that there is an h \u2208 A r {e} such\nthat {e, h} \u2208 Q. If {h} \u2208 Q then, since Q is convex, A\u25b3{e} \u2208 Q;\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n19\n\nsince we have assumed that this is not the case, {h} 6\u2208 Q. Now let\nR := Q \u2229 B({e, g, h}). The partition polynomial for the restriction of\n\u03c9 to R has the form\nZ|R = Ke ye + Kg yg + Keg ye yg + Keh ye yh + Kgh yg yh + Kegh ye yg yh\nfor nonnegative constants KS with Ke , Kg , Keg , and Keh positive. This\nis Rayleigh, by Lemma 4.1(a). The Rayleigh difference of e and h in\nZ|R is\n\u2206Z|R{e, h} = (Ke + Keg yg )Kgh yg \u2212 Kg yg (Keh + Kegh yg ).\n\nSince this is nonnegative for all y > 0 it must be the case that Kgh > 0;\nthat is, {g, h} \u2208 Q. This set has the form of the set C in subcase I(i),\nreducing the problem to that previously solved subcase. This completes\nthe analysis of Case I.\nCase II: e \u2208 B.\nSubcase (i): |A| \u2265 2.\nIn this case Lemma 4.5 can be used to ensure that the particular element e \u2208 B is contained in C. From this point, the argument for\nsubcase I(i) applies verbatim to this subcase as well, establishing the\nSEA for (A, B, e) in Q in this subcase.\nSubcase (ii): |A| = 1.\nIf e \u2208 C then A \u2282 A\u25b3{e} \u2286 C, so that A\u25b3{e} \u2208 Q because Q is\nconvex. Thus we can assume that e \u2208 B r C. Let A = {g}. Since\n{g} \u2286 C and Q is convex we can assume that |C| = 2, so let C = {g, h}\nwith h \u2208 B. By the SEA for ({g}, B r{h}, e) in Qh , either {e, g, h} \u2208 Q\nor {e, h} \u2208 Q. If {e, g, h} \u2208 Q then {e, g} \u2208 Q since Q is convex; but\n{e, g} = A\u25b3{e} 6\u2208 Q by a previous assumption. Thus we see that\n{e, h} \u2208 Q. Let R := Q \u2229 B({e, g, h}). The partition polynomial for\nthe restriction of \u03c9 to R has the form\nZ|R = K\u2205 + Ke ye + Kg yg + Kh yh + Keh ye yh + Kgh yg yh\nfor nonnegative constants KS with Kg , Kgh , and Keh positive. This is\nRayleigh, by Lemma 4.1(a). The Rayleigh difference of e and h in Z|R\nis\n\u2206Z|R{e, h} = Ke (Kh + Kgh yg ) \u2212 (K\u2205 + Kg yg )Keh .\nSince this is nonnegative for all y > 0 it must be the case that Ke > 0;\nthat is, {e} \u2208 Q. Since A\u25b3{e, g} = {e} \u2208 Q, this establishes the SEA\nfor (A, B, e) in Q in Case II.\nThis completes the case analysis, the induction step, and the proof.\n\u0003\nAfter that, proofs of the following consequences follow familiar lines.\nProposition 4.7(a) implies (f-0) for Rayleigh \u03c9 with support Q.\n\n\f20\n\nDAVID G.

The quantity \u2206Z{e, f } = C + Byg + Ayg2 is a quadratic polynomial of yg . For any values yc > 0 for all c \u2208 Er{e, f, g}, this polynomial\nis nonnegative for all yg \u2265 0. Since AC \u2265 0, if B 2 \u22124AC \u2265 0 then both\nroots have the same sign. Thus, either B 2 \u2212 4AC < 0 or B 2 \u2212 4AC \u2265 0\nand B \u2265 0. This yields the desired inequality.\n\u0003\n5. Sufficient Conditions.\n5.1. examples.\nExample 5.1. Let U = U(m, r) denote the uniform matroid of rank\nr on m elements. Its rank function on B(E) is given by rank(S) =\nmin{r, |S|} for all S \u2286 E. Its Potts model partition function Z(U, q; y)\nis in the exchangeable case, and so it is Rayleigh if and only if (q \u2212 min{r,k} :\n0 \u2264 k \u2264 m) is logarithmically concave with no internal zeros, by Proposition 3.6. This occurs for all 0 < q \u2264 1.\nExample 5.2. Small graphs can be shown to be I\u2013Rayleigh by moderate computations. For Z = Z(IKn ; y), for example, there are two\ncases by symmetry for \u2206Z{e, f }: the edges {e, f } are either adjacent or not. With E(K4 ) = {{1, 2}, ..., {3, 4}} labelled {1, ..., 6} in\nlexicographic order, we need only calculate \u2206Z{1, 2} and \u2206Z{1, 6}.\nThe results are that \u2206Z{1, 2} \u226b 0 (has positive coefficients) and that\n\u2206Z{1, 6} \u226b (y2 y5 \u2212 y3 y4 )2 . In both cases \u2206Z is nonnegative for all\ny > 0. Thus IK4 is Rayleigh.\nSimilar computations have shown that K6 , K3,4 and W7 are I\u2013Rayleigh.\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n23\n\nAlan Sokal showed me a computation that the Potts model of K4 is\nRayleigh for all 0 < q \u2264 1, in Oct. 2005.\nConjecture 5.3 has been checked for n \u2264 6.\nConjecture 5.3. If e, f are adjacent edges in Kn then \u2206Z(IKn ){e, f }\n\u226b 0 (has positive coefficients).\nConjecture 5.4 implies Conjecture 5.3. The analogous statement\nwith BG in place of IG follows from Theorem 5.6 of Choe and Wagner\n[13].\nConjecture 5.4. If e, f are edges in a graph G and \u2206Z(IG){e, f } has\nnegative coefficients, then there is a K4 \u2013minor of G in which e and f\noccur on non\u2013adjacent edges.\nOne might also conjecture that the only terms in \u2206Z(IG){e, f } with\nnegative coefficients already appear in \u2206Z(BG){e, f }. This is too optimistic \u2013 it is true for K4 but not for K5 .

Simplifying the above formula we obtain\n(1 \u2212 q)2 \u2206N{e, f } = (M g )2 (C + B\u03b3 + A\u03b3 2 )\nin which\nC = q 2 \u2206Lg {e, f } \u2212 q\u0398L{e, f |g} + \u2206Lg {e, f }\nB = \u22122q\u2206Lg {e, f } + (1 + q)\u0398L{e, f |g} \u2212 2\u2206Lg {e, f }\nA = \u2206Lg {e, f } \u2212 \u0398L{e, f |g} + \u2206Lg {e, f }.\nAnother way to write this is\nC + B\u03b3 + A\u03b3 2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n= (\u03b3 \u2212 q)2 \u2206Lg {e, f } + yg \u0398L{e, f |g} + yg2\u2206Lg {e, f } .\n\nin which yg := (1 \u2212 \u03b3)/(\u03b3 \u2212 q) is positive and finite for all 0 < q < 1\nand y > 0. Thus\n(1 \u2212 q)2 \u2206N{e, f } = (M g )2 (\u03b3 \u2212 q)2 \u2206L{e, f }(yg = (1 \u2212 \u03b3)/(\u03b3 \u2212 q)).\nThis is nonnegative for all 0 < q \u2264 q\u2217 (L). Therefore, the Potts model\nof N = L \u2295g M is Rayleigh for\n0 < q \u2264 min{q\u2217 (L), q\u2217 (M)}.\nThis completes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\n5.3. classes of rayleigh matroids.\nProposition 5.9. Let G = (V, E) be a finite connected graph. For each\nS \u2208 IG let \u03c9G (S) be the product of the sizes of the connected components\nPn\u22121\nfk (\u03c9G )tn\u2212k has\nof (V, S). Then \u03c9G , supported on IG, is such that k=0\nonly real (nonpositive) zeros, the condition (f-6).\n\n\fNEGATIVE CORRELATION\n\n29\n\nProof. Orient the edges of G arbitrarily, and let D be the corresponding\nV \u2013by\u2013E signed incidence matrix, and Y := diag(ye : e \u2208 E), and\nQ := DY D \u2020 . For any y > 0 the matrix Q is Hermitian, in fact positive\nsemidefinite with a one\u2013dimensional nullspace, so that det(tI + Q) has\nonly real zeros. By the Binet\u2013Cauchy identity and the principal minors\nmatrix\u2013tree theorem [10],\nX\ndet(tI + Q) =\nt|R| det Q(R|R)\nR\u2286V\n\n=\n\nX\n\nt|R|\n\nR\u2286V\n\n=\n\nn\nX\nk=0\n\nX\n\nS\u2208B(E,n\u2212|R|)\n\ntn\u2212k\n\nX\n\n| det D(R|S]|2yS\n\n\u03c9G (S)yS .\n\nS\u2208B(E,k)\n\nFor all y > 0 this polynomial has only real (nonpositive) zeros. When\ny = 1 this implies (f-6).\n\u0003\nConjecture 5.10. For any finite connected graph G, the \u03c9G defined in\nProposition 5.9 is Rayleigh.\nHere is a very interesting formula for Z(IG; y) from which we might\nbe able to see that IG is Rayleigh. The Grassmann\u2013Berezin calculus\ntechnique of [1, 8, 9] is great, and in particular formula (13) of CJSSS\n[9] implies that\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nZ\nX\ntn Z(IG; y/t) = d(\u03c8 \u03c8\u0304) exp \uf8f0\u03c8\u0304(tI + Q)\u03c8 \u2212 t\nye \u03c8\u0304i \u03c8i \u03c8\u0304j \u03c8j \uf8fb .\ne=hiji\u2208E\n\nHere \u03c8i and \u03c8\u0304i are fermionic degrees of freedom associated with vertex\ni, and Q = DY D \u2020 is as in Proposition 5.9. Combinatorially, the idea\nis that trees can also be rooted negatively at their edges as well as\npositively at their vertices. Since a tree has one more vertex than\nedge, each tree gets a net count of one, and so each spanning forest is\ncounted exactly once. It should be possible to compute \u2206Z(IG){e, f }\nfrom this \u2013 to see if it is positive will be more difficult. Generalization\nof this formula to wider classes of matroids is also a worthy goal. For\ncomparison, note that\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\ndet(tI + Q) = d(\u03c8 \u03c8\u0304) exp \u03c8\u0304(tI + Q)\u03c8 .\nTo conclude, let's sum up our paltry stock of examples.\nThe class of Potts\u2013Rayleigh matroids:\n* contains all uniform matroids U(m, r);\n\n\f30\n\nDAVID G. WAGNER\n\n* contains the graph K4 ;\n* is closed by taking duals, minors, and two\u2013sums.\nThe class of I\u2013Rayleigh matroids:\n* contains all Potts\u2013Rayleigh matroids;\n* contains the graphs K6 , K3,4 , and W7 ;\n* is closed by taking minors and two\u2013sums.\nThe class of Potts\u2013Rayleigh matroids contains all series\u2013parallel graphs.\nThus, if the Big Conjecture 3.4 is true then every series\u2013parallel graph\nsatisfies Mason's Conjecture (I-4).\nConjecture 5.11. The class of I\u2013Rayleigh matroids contains\n1. all planar graphs;\n2. all graphs;\n3. all regular matroids;\n4. all sixth\u2013root of unity matroids;\n5. all half\u2013plane property matroids;\n6. all B\u2013Rayleigh matroids.\nBy familiar results and others in [12, 13], these conjectures are increasingly strong. Conjecture 5.11.6 is that IM is Rayleigh if and only\nif BM is Rayleigh \u2013 this is almost certainly false, and a specific counterexample is much to be desired. Conjecture 5.11.2 seems reasonable.\nSimilar conjectures could be made about the Potts\u2013Rayleigh condition,\nwith even less evidence.\nReferences\n[1] A.
