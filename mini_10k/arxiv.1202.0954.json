The career of a young physicist\nOne of the most eminent physicists ever, Ernest Rutherford earned his scientific\nreputation primarily by his pioneering contributions to radioactivity and nuclear\nphysics (Eve 1939; Wilson 1983). Indeed, he discovered the atomic nucleus and\nfounded nuclear physics as a flourishing research field. When one of his colleagues\nand biographers, the English-Canadian physicist Arthur Stewart Eve, once\nobserved that Rutherford always appeared to be riding on the \"crest of the wave,\"\nRutherford replied, \"Well! I made the wave, didn't I?\" (Eve 1939, p. 436). He was\n\nCentre for Science Studies, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark. E-mail:\nhelge.kragh@ivs.au.dk. A version of this paper will appear in Spanish in a book to be\npublished by the Residencia de Estudiantes in Madrid.\n*\n\n\f2\n\nnot a modest man, and had no reason to be modest, yet he added, \"At least to some\nextent.\"\nAs a result of his early work in radioactivity, at the age of 37 he was\nawarded the Nobel Prize in chemistry. That he was awarded the chemistry prize,\nand not the one in physics, may appear strange, but at the time radioactivity was\ngenerally considered a branch of chemistry rather than physics. Later in life, when\nhe had become a public figure and statesman of science, he received numerous\nhonours and scientific prizes. For example, in 1914 he was made a knight, in 1922\nhe received the prestigious Copley Medal from the Royal Society, and in 1925 he\nwas honoured by being conferred the Order of Merit. He ended his life as Baron\nRutherford of Nelson, a title which was conferred on him in 1931.\nBorn in 1871 near Nelson in rural New Zealand, in 1887 young Rutherford\nwon a scholarship to Nelson College, a secondary school, where he boarded for\nthree years. After having received another scholarship, from 1890 to 1894 he\nattended Canterbury College in Christchurch, where he was able to cultivate his\ngrowing interest in mathematics and physics. Having obtained a Master of Arts\ndegree, he did work on the magnetization of iron by a rapidly alternating electric\ncurrent and also invented an apparatus that could detect wireless or Hertzian\nwaves over what at the standards of the time were large distances. In 1895 he was\nawarded a scholarship that allowed him to go to England to do graduate research\nat Cambridge University's famous Cavendish Laboratory. The director of the\nlaboratory was J. J. Thomson, who a few years later would initiate a new chapter in\nthe history of physics by discovering the electron. Thomson was keenly interested\nin Rutherford's electromagnetic detector and generally impressed by his brilliance\nat experimental research.\nThe result was a joint paper on the ionization of gases caused by the\nrecently discovered X-rays. According to the two Cambridge physicists, the effect\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 1. Young Ernest\nRutherford, at the time\nhe was a professor at\nMcGill University.\n\nof the X-rays was to create an equal number of positive and negative ions in the gas\nmolecules. Apart from examining the action of the X-rays, in subsequent work\nRutherford (1899) turned to the even more recent \u2013 and even more enigmatic \u2013 rays\nproduced by uranium and a few other substances. In his first work on what at the\ntime was often known as either \"uranium rays\" or \"Becquerel rays\" (after their\ndiscoverer, Henri Becquerel) he demonstrated that the rays were inhomogeneous,\nconsisting of at least two components. One of the components was easily absorbed\nwhile the other had a greater ability of penetrating matter. Rutherford called the\nfirst component \"alpha\" and the second type \"beta.\" At the end of the lengthy\npaper he suggested that the rays were similar to X-rays, but \"The cause and origin\nof the radiation continuously emitted by uranium and its salts still remain a\nmystery\" (Rutherford 1899, p. 163).\nShortly after having completed this important work on uranium rays,\nRutherford left Cambridge for Montreal, Canada, where he had been offered the\nMacDonald professorship in physics at McGill University (Figure 1). It was here he\nwould make a name for himself as the leading authority in radioactive research.\n\n\f4\n\n2. Enigmas of radioactivity\nFollowing the announcement of Marie and Pierre Curie in 1898 that they had\ndiscovered two new radioactive elements, radium and polonium, the nascent field\nof radioactivity was eagerly taken up by an increasing number of physicists and\nchemists. Which substances were radioactive? How did they fit into the periodic\nsystem of the elements? Was the apparently spontaneous activity affected by\nphysical and chemical changes? These were some of the questions addressed by the\nfirst generation of specialists in radioactive research, a field initially dominated by\nscientists in Paris and Montreal. The ambitious and competitive Rutherford was\ndetermined to establish himself as the leader of research in radioactivity. \"I have to\nkeep going, as there are always people on my track,\" he wrote to his mother in\n1902. \"I have to publish my present work as rapidly as possible in order to keep in\nthe race. The best sprinters in this road of investigation are Becquerel and the\nCuries in Paris, who have done a great deal of very important work on the subject\nof radioactive bodies during the last few years\" (Pais 1986, p. 62).\nRutherford not only kept in the race, his scientific results established him as\nan authority in radioactivity on line with, or even in front of, the Curies. During his\nMontreal period he engaged not only in innovative research but also found time to\nwrite two of the first comprehensive textbooks on the subject: Radio-Activity\nappeared in 1904, and two years later his Silliman lectures of 1905 were published\nunder the title Radioactive Transformations. They are both classics of science.\nExamining the ionization caused by thorium, in 1900 he identified a radioactive gas\nthat became known as \"thorium emanation\" but the chemical nature of which at\nfirst eluded him. The puzzle only increased when somewhat similar \"emanations\"\nwere found associated with radium and actinium. Collaborating with Frederick\nSoddy, an English demonstrator in chemistry working at McGill, Rutherford\n\n\f5\n\nprovided experimental evidence that the emanation was most likely a new inert gas\n\u2013 what today is called radon. Moreover, they found that emanation, whether from\nthorium or radium, lost its activity over a brief period of time. This was the first\nindication that radioactive substances were characterized by a new parameter, a\nlife-time or a half-life (Rutherford 1900).\nMore than other specialists in radioactivity, Rutherford focused his\nresearch on the properties and nature of the alpha rays. Early experiments\nsuggested that these rays went undeflected through electric and magnetic fields\nand thus were neutral, a view that Rutherford and other researchers held for a year\nor two. However, further experiments made in Montreal proved that the particles\nmaking up the alpha rays were actually positive and with a mass comparable to\nthat of the hydrogen atom. Rutherford soon came to the conclusion that the\nparticles were positive ions of helium, the inert gas that originally had been\ndetected in the sun's atmosphere and in 1895 was discovered in uranium minerals.\nAlthough convinced that alpha particles were doubly charged helium ions (He2+), it\nwas only in 1908, after he had moved to Manchester, that he provided the final\nproof for the \u03b1 = He2+ hypothesis. This he did in a brilliant experiment with his\nassistant Thomas Royds in which it was proved spectroscopically that helium was\nproduced by the alpha rays emitted by radium emanation. Together with data from\nthe magnetic and electric deflection of alpha rays, the experiment gave \"a decisive\nproof that the \u03b1 particle after loosing its charge is an atom of helium\" (Rutherford\nand Royds 1909, p. 166).\nWhile primarily investigating radioactivity from an experimental\nperspective, Rutherford was also keenly interested in explaining the phenomenon\nin causal terms. The origin of radioactivity was at the time a complete mystery, but\nduring the first decade of the twentieth century many physicists came to believe\nthat it had to be found in the internal structure of the atom (Kragh 1997).\n\n\f6\n\nRutherford was generally in favour of a model of the composite atom along the\nlines suggested by J. J. Thomson, assuming that negative electrons and positive\nalpha particles preexisted in the atom in some dynamical equilibrium\nconfiguration. As they rotated or vibrated, they would loose energy in accordance\nwith the laws of electromagnetism and eventually be expelled from the atom.\nRutherford realized that this \"radiation-drain hypothesis\" was not entirely\nsatisfactory, but in lack of better explanation he cautiously supported it. As he saw\nit, some future development of atomic theory, perhaps a modification of the\nThomson model, would most likely yield a causal explanation of radioactivity in\nterms of the internal structure of the atom. He examined the question in some detail\nin his Silliman lectures, where he concluded that Thomson's approach, although\n\"somewhat artificial,\" was nonetheless \"of great value as indicating the general\nmethod of attack of the greatest problem that at present confronts the physicist.\"\nRutherford (1906, p. 265) wrote:\nAs our knowledge of atomic properties increases in accuracy it may yet be\npossible to deduce a structure of the atom which fulfills the conditions required by\nexperiment. A promising beginning has already been made, and there is every\nhope that still further advances will soon be made in the elucidation of the\nmystery of atomic structure.\n\nThe mystery of atomic structure was eventually elucidated, but an explanation of\nradioactivity of the kind Rutherford had in mind never appeared. Only after the\nemergence of quantum mechanics did it become clear that radioactivity is a\ngenuinely acausal phenomenon. In any case, on the hypothesis that radioactivity\nwas caused by disruptions of electrical particles in the interior of the atom it\nseemed natural to suppose that it was a property common to all matter. Were all\nelements radioactive, only some more active than others? This was indeed what\nmany scientists believed at the time, especially after Norman Campbell had proved\n\n\f7\n\nin 1906 that potassium and rubidium are weakly radioactive (they contain the betaradioactive isotopes K-40 and Rb-87, respectively, both with very long life-times).\nRutherford shared the view that radioactivity is a general property of\nmatter: \"It is a matter of general experience that every physical property discovered\nfor one element has been found to be shared by others in varying degree ... It might\nthus be expected as general principles that the property of radioactivity which is so\nmarked in a substance like radium would be shown by other substances\"\n(Rutherford 1906, p. 217).\n\n3. Transmutations and atomic decay\nIn December 1908 Rutherford received in Stockholm the Nobel Prize in chemistry\n\"for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of\nradioactive substances.\" Somewhat bemused to have transformed so quickly from a\nphysicist to a chemist, he chose as the subject for his Nobel Lecture \"The Chemical\nNature of the Alpha Particles from Radioactive Substances\" (Rutherford 1962-1965,\nvol. 2, pp. 137-146). Rutherford had been nominated for the 1907 prize in both\nphysics (seven nominations) and chemistry (one nomination), and also in 1908\nthere were more physics than chemistry nominations, namely, five to three.\nInterestingly, far most of the nominators were Germans, while none were British\n(Jarlskog 2008). An important reason for the award of the prestigious prize was the\ndisintegration or decay theory of radioactivity, which he had proposed some years\nearlier and which still counts as the fundamental law of radioactive change.\nAs mentioned, in his study of 1900 of the properties of thorium emanation\nRutherford had found that the activity of the substance decreased exponentially in\ntime and thus could be ascribed a definite half-life. In his further investigation of\nthe phenomena of decay and regeneration of radioactive intensity he joined forces\n\n\f8\n\nFigure 2. The exponential decay of radium emanation (radon) and the\nregeneration of radium, as shown in the 1903 Rutherford-Soddy paper.\n\nwith Soddy, which in 1902 resulted in the first version of the disintegration theory,\nto appear in a refined form the following year (Figure 2). According to Rutherford\nand Soddy, a radioactive substance transformed into another substance in the sense\nthat the atoms changed from a \"parent element\" to another \"daughter element\" at a\ncharacteristic rate. Not only do atoms change or transmute, they also do so\nrandomly, such as expressed by a certain decay constant (\u03bb) that depends only on\nthe nature of the radioactive element. The fraction of atoms dN that disintegrate in a\nsmall interval of time dt follows the expression\n\n( )\n\nIn another formulation, if a radioactive substance originally, at t = 0, consists of N0\natoms, after a time t the number of the same atoms will be reduced to\n\n( )\n\n\f9\n\nThe decay constant, which is measured in inverse time units, can also be expressed\nby the mean life-time T or the half-life T1\u20442, the time required for the number of\nparticles to decrease by a factor of 2. The connection between the three quantities is\n\nAs Rutherford was well aware, the decay law is of a statistical nature, giving only\nthe probability that an atom decays in some interval of time between t0 and t0 + \u0394t.\nSome atoms will decay almost instantly, while others will survive for a much\nlonger time. Another way of expressing this statistical nature is that a radioactive\natom does not age: the probability of decay does not depend at all on the age of the\natom, but only on its kind. Rutherford realized that the form of the decay law\nseemed to disagree with causal-dynamical models of radioactivity, such as\nadvocated by J. J. Thomson. For according to these models, \"All atoms formed at\nthe same time should last for a definite interval. This, however, is contrary to the\nobserved law of transformation, in which the atoms have a life embracing all values\nfrom zero to infinity\" (Rutherford 1906, p. 267). Neither Rutherford nor others\ncould explain the conundrum.\nAlthough the transformation theory of Rutherford and Soddy met some\nresistance in chemical circles, it was accepted remarkably smoothly by the majority\nof physicists. However, French physicists were an exception. Marie and Pierre\nCurie, Albert Laborde, Andr\u00e9 Debierne, and other French specialists in\nradioactivity adopted a positivistic ideal of science which implied that phenomena\nshould be given high priority and material hypotheses low priority. They\nconsequently refused to commit themselves to specific causal hypotheses such as\nsubatomic transformation (Malley 1979). The resistance in Paris towards the\n\n\f10\n\nRutherford-Soddy theory was a major reason why the momentum in radioactive\nresearch changed from Paris to other centres in Canada, England and Germany.\nRutherford and Soddy realized that the constant activities of uranium and\nthorium were only apparent, a result of very long life-times that would not\nimmediately turn up experimentally. In an important paper of 1903 they stated the\ngeneral law of radioactive change, noting that \"The complexity of the phenomena\nof radioactivity is due to the existence as a general rule of several different types of\nmatter changing at the same time into one another, each type possessing a different\nradioactive constant\" (Rutherford and Soddy 1903, p. 580). They also pointed out,\nas did Pierre Curie and Laborde in Paris at the same time, that the energy released\nin the disintegration of radium was enormous compared with the one arising from\nchemical combustion processes. For the energy of one gram of radium they\nestimated a lower limit of 15,000 calories or 63 kJ per year.\nRutherford and Soddy were evidently fascinated by the prospects of what\nthey called \"atomic energy\" and which they conceived as a general form of energy\nlocked up in all atoms, not only in those belonging to the radioactive elements.\nThey further speculated that the new atomic energy would prove to be of great\nimportance to astrophysics as it promised an explanation of stellar energy\nproduction: \"The maintenance of solar energy, for example, no longer presents any\nfundamental difficulty if the internal energy of the component elements is\nconsidered to be available, i.e. if processes of sub-atomic change are going on.\"\nLess speculatively, Rutherford and his American collaborator, the\nradiochemist Bertram Boltwood at Yale University, realized that the radioactive\ndecay law might provide a way to estimate the age of old rocks and thus to settle\nthe much discussed question of the age of the earth, a question that physicists and\ngeologists had widely different opinions of (Badash 1989). Recognizing that helium\nwas produced by alpha-radioactive bodies, in 1904 Rutherford suggested that the\n\n\f11\n\nhelium trapped in radioactive minerals might provide a means for determining the\nage of the earth. The method did not work, and a better one was proposed by\nBoltwood, who had found that lead is always present in uranium minerals. This he\ntook as evidence that it was the end product of the uranium series. Using\nRutherford's data and the decay law, the age of rock samples could be estimated.\nThe result was that the age of the earth was probably greater than one billion years,\na value much exceeding earlier estimates based on thermodynamical reasoning.\nIn 1929 Rutherford used a much improved version of the uranium-lead\nmethod to argue that the upper limit of the age of the earth was 3.4 billion years, a\nvalue some two billion years short of the presently known age, which is 4.55 \u00b1 0.07\nbillion years (Rutherford 1929).\n\n4. The road to the nuclear atom\nRutherford was not originally much interested in atomic structure, except that he in\na general way favoured a model of the kind proposed by Thomson, where the\nelectrons moved in circular orbits within a sphere of atomic dimensions\nhomogeneously filled with a fluid of positive electricity. \"The mobile electrons\nconstitute, so to speak, the bricks of the atomic structure, while the positive\nelectricity acts as the necessary mortar to bind them together,\" as Rutherford (1906,\np. 266) phrased it. When he seriously turned to atomic theory, which he only did\nafter having become professor at Manchester University in 1908, it was to a large\nextent the result of his deep interest in the particles constituting the alpha rays\n(Heilbron 1968; Badash 1983).\nIn experiments with Hans Geiger, a young German physicist, Rutherford\ndeveloped a technique that enabled them to detect individual alpha particles by the\nscintillations caused when a particle hit a screen of zinc sulphide. In 1908 Geiger\nreported preliminary results of the scattering of alpha particles on metal foils, but\n\n\f12\n\nFigure 3.

B and M can rotate, while\nthe metal foil F and the radon source R\nremain in their positions.\n\nonly at small angular deflections. The following year he investigated the matter\nmore fully in collaboration with 21-year-old Ernest Marsden (Figure 3). The two\nphysicists found that heavier metals were far more effective as reflectors than light\nones and that a thin platinum foil scattered one of every 8,000 alpha particles by an\nangle \u03c6 larger than 90 degrees. These early experiments induced Rutherford to\ndevelop a unified scattering theory that could not only account for the ordinary\nscattering of alpha and beta particles but also for the large-angle scattering of the\nfirst kind of particle.\nWhereas Thomson pictured the alpha particle as an atomic congregation of\n10-12 electrons, Rutherford came to the conclusion that it was a point particle, like\nthe electron. Because the alpha particle was a helium atom deprived of its two\nelectrons, this view implied, in effect, a nuclear model of the helium atom. By late\n1910 Rutherford was focusing on a new picture of atomic structure that was\nconsistent with the scattering experiments and differed drastically from the\nThomson model (Figure 4). On 14 December 1910 he wrote to Boltwood: \"I think I\ncan devise an atom much superior to J. J.'s, for the explanation of and stoppage of \u03b1\nand \u03b2 particles, and at the same time I think it will fit in extraordinarily well with\n\n\f13\n\nFigure 4. Rutherford's early\ncalculations of the scattering of\nalpha particles, and his sketch of\nthe nuclear atom. He pictured a\nheavy atom as consisting of a\ncentral positive charge\nsurrounded by negative electrons,\nbut without considering their\nconfigurations.\n\nthe experimental numbers\" (Badash 1969, p. 235). He presented his new and\nsupposedly superior atomic model in a landmark paper in the Philosophical\nMagazine of May 1911.\nIn this paper Rutherford concluded that in order to produce the observed\ndeflections of \u03c6 > 90\u00b0, scattering had to take place in a single encounter between the\nalpha particle and a highly charged and concentrated mass. He consequently\nsuggested that the atom contained at its centre a massive charge Ne surrounded by\na cloud of the opposite charge (e denotes the elementary electrical charge). Since the\nresults of his calculations were independent of the sign of the charge, the nucleus\ncould just as well be a concentration of electrons embedded in a positive fluid \u2013 not\nunlike an extreme case of the Thomson atom. He explained: \"Consider an atom\nwhich contains a charge \u00b1 Ne at its centre surrounded by a sphere of electrification\n\n\f14\n\ncontaining a charge\n\nNe supposed uniformly distributed throughout a sphere of\n\nradius R.\" As to the sign of the central charge: \"For convenience, the sign will be\nassumed to be positive\" (Rutherford 1911, p. 670 and p. 687).\nBased on this picture of the atom, Rutherford derived a general formula\nthat expressed the number of charged particles y scattered a certain angle \u03c6 at a\ndistance from the scattering material. The formula, soon known as the Rutherford\nscattering formula, related the function y = y(\u03c6) to the mass and velocity of the\nincident particles, the number of atoms in a unit volume of the scattering material,\nand the nuclear charge N of this material. As Rutherford demonstrated, in the case\nof alpha particles in particular his formula agreed very well with the experimental\ndata obtained in Manchester. The data indicated \"that the value of this central\ncharge for different atoms is approximately proportional to their atomic weights, at\nany rate for atoms heavier than aluminium.\" According to Rutherford's analysis,\nthe gold atom, of atomic weight A = 197, had a charge of N \u2245 100, which agreed\nreasonably well with what he suspected was a general approximation, namely the\nrelationship A/2 < N < A.\nIt should be pointed out that in 1911 the notion of the atomic number Z as\nthe ordinal number of the elements in the periodic system did not yet exist.\nChemical elements were still defined by their atomic weights. Rutherford might\nhave been the first to use the term \"atomic number,\" which he did at the end of\n1913, but the concept was introduced a little earlier by the Dutch amateur physicist\nAntonius van den Broek. According to van den Broek, the physical meaning of the\natomic number was that it represented the nuclear charge in the Rutherford atom\n(that is, Z = N).\nThe idea of concentrating the positive atomic charge in a tiny central part of\nthe atom was not quite original with Rutherford's model. In 1904 the Japanese\nphysicist Hantaro Nagaoka had proposed a \"Saturnian\" model in which thousands\n\n\f15\n\nof electrons rotated on one or more circles around a massive positive charge of\nminute dimensions. Nagaoka's Saturnian atom was well known for a couple of\nyears, but it turned out to be unstable and played no motivating role for\nRutherford. He did however refer to Nagaoka's theory, which he compared with\nhis own. Nowhere in his paper of 1911 did Rutherford refer to the central charge as\na \"nucleus\" or his model as a \"nuclear atom\" (nor did Nagaoka use such\nterminology). The name \"nucleus\" was first used by the British astrophysicist John\nNicholson in a paper that appeared later in 1911, and then in connection with an\natomic model which was only superficially related to Rutherford's.\nTerminology apart, the nuclear atom introduced by Rutherford in 1911 did\nnot make a splash in the world of physics. It would soon be recognized as a\nrevolution in the theory of matter, but at the time it was met with indifference and\nscarcely considered to be a new theory of the constitution of the atom. It was not\nmentioned in proceedings of the first Solvay congress, taking place in Brussels in\nthe autumn of 1911 with Rutherford as a participant, nor did it receive much\nattention in the physics journals. Even Rutherford himself did not consider his\ndiscovery as the epoch-making event that it turned out to be. For example, in his\nmassive 1913 textbook on radioactivity, titled Radioactive Substances and their\nRadiations, there were only two references to the nuclear atom and its implications.\nHe now declared the nucleus to be positively charged, surrounded by electrons\n\"which may be supposed to be distributed throughout a spherical volume or in\nconcentric rings in one plane.\" The nucleus was extremely small, but not point-like.\nOn the contrary, Rutherford pictured it as a complex body held together by what\nwould become known as nuclear forces, the first example of strong interactions\n(Rutherford 1913, p. 620):\nPractically the whole charge and mass of the atom are concentrated at the centre,\nand are probably confined within a sphere of radius not greater than 10-12 cm. No\n\n\f16\n\ndoubt the positively charged centre of the atom is a complicated system in\nmovement, consisting in part of charged helium and hydrogen atoms. It would\nappear as if the positively charged atoms of matter attract one another at very\nsmall distances for otherwise it is difficult to see how the component parts at the\ncentre are held together.\n\nIn other words, if a strong attractive force was not postulated, the electrostatic\nrepulsion between the constituent nuclear charges would blow the nucleus apart.\nIt is customary to speak of Rutherford's atomic model, but in 1911 there\nwas not really such a model, at least not in the sense of \"atomic model\" that was\nordinarily adopted at the time. Rutherford presented his theory primarily as a\nscattering theory and realized that, considered as a theory of atomic structure, it\nwas most incomplete. First and foremost, it could offer no suggestion of how the\nextra-nuclear electrons were arranged, the very issue that was central to atomic\nmodels. \"The question of the stability of the atom proposed need not be\nconsidered,\" he wrote, \"for this will obviously depend upon the minute structure\nof the atom, and on the motion of the constituent charged parts\" (Rutherford 1911,\np. 671). His nuclear atom was impotent when it came to chemical questions such as\nvalency and the periodic system, and it fared no better when it came to physical\nquestions such as spectra, magnetic properties, and the dispersion of light. An\natomic theory anno 1911 would be considered really convincing only if it included\nthe system of electrons, which Rutherford's did not.\nThe status of the nuclear theory improved in the spring of 1913, when\nGeiger and Marsden published new data on the scattering of alpha particles that\nwere in excellent agreement with the scattering formula. The new experiments\nsharpened the relationship between the nuclear charge and atomic weight, which\nRutherford now took to be N \u2245 A/2. The work of Geiger and Marsden confirmed\nRutherford's atomic model considered as a scattering theory, but not as a theory of\natomic structure. The new results obtained in Manchester were as irrelevant for the\n\n\f17\n\nelectronic configurations as Rutherford's atom was silent about them. It is\nunderstandable that most physicists outside Manchester preferred to ignore the\nnuclear atom or consider it merely a hypothesis.\n\n5. The Bohr-Rutherford atomic model\nAfter a stay with Thomson in Cambridge, in March 1912 young Niels Bohr arrived\nin Manchester to do postdoctoral work under Rutherford. The 26-year-old Danish\nphysicist was convinced of the essential truth of the nuclear atom, which he first\nused to investigate the energy loss of alpha particles as they were absorbed in\nmatter. Within a few months he was able to present to Rutherford some\npreliminary ideas of atomic structure that a year later resulted in a seminal series of\nthree papers with the common title \"On the Constitution of Atoms and Molecules\"\n(Heilbron and Kuhn 1969; Kragh 2012). Bohr's new theory turned Rutherford's\nnuclear atom into a full-blown quantum model of the atom, and it was only with\nthis extension that the nuclear atom became scientifically fertile and widely\naccepted. For example, Kasimir Fajans, a Polish radiochemist who worked in\nManchester, did not originally accept Rutherford's nuclear model. In a letter to\nRutherford from the end of 1913, he wrote: \"I have followed Bohr's papers with\nextraordinary interest, and now I no longer doubt the complete correctness of your\natomic theory. The reservations I expressed ... have been entirely removed by\nBohr's work\" (Kragh 2012, p. 48).\nIn his original discussion of the Rutherford atom Bohr focused on its lack of\nmechanical stability and the formation of simple molecules, whereas he\ndisregarded issues of optical spectroscopy. Only in March 1913 did he fully realize\nthat the new atomic theory he had in mind must include the emission of line\nspectra as a crucial feature. In his paper in the July 1913 issue of Philosophical\n\n\f18\n\nMagazine he emphasized from the beginning that all his considerations rested on\nRutherford's nuclear atom, which he summarized as follows (Bohr 1913, p. 1):\nAccording to this theory, the atoms consist of a positively charged nucleus\nsurrounded by a system of electrons kept together by attractive forces from the\nnucleus; the total negative charge of the electrons is equal to the positive charge of\nthe nucleus. Further, the nucleus is assumed to be the seat of the essential part of\nthe mass of the atom, and to have linear dimensions exceedingly small compared\nwith the linear dimensions of the whole system.\n\nBohr pointed out several weaknesses of this model, in particular that it was\nunstable from both a mechanical and electromagnetic point of view. In the case of a\nhydrogen atom, consisting of a single electron revolving around a nucleus of\nopposite charge, it followed from Maxwellian electrodynamics that the electron\nwould radiate energy, with the result that the radius would decrease until the\nelectron coalesced with the nucleus (Figure 5). Obviously, to save the attractive idea\nof the nuclear atom some drastic revisions in the picture of the atom had to be\nmade. These revisions Bohr formulated in two postulates which violated\nassumptions of classical physics and introduced the quantum discontinuity as an\nessential feature in atomic architecture. An atomic system, he claimed, can only\nexist in certain \"stationary states\" in which revolving electrons do not emit energy.\nOnly when the system changes abruptly from a higher state E2 to a lower state E1\nwill the energy difference appear as radiation with a frequency \u03bd given by\n\nwhere h is Planck's quantum of action. What matters in the present context is that\nBohr's theory was eminently successful in explaining precisely those phenomena\nabout which the original Rutherford atom had nothing to say. The successes were\nprimarily restricted to the spectra of simple atoms and ions (such as H, He+ and\n\n\f19\n\nFigure 5. Bohr's draft calculations from 1913 of the radiation emitted\nby a circulating electron, causing it to spiral towards the nucleus.\n\nLi2+), but the theory also promised an explanation of the formation of molecules and\nthe structure of complex atoms in accordance with the periodic system\nAlthough Rutherford's tiny atomic nucleus was largely outside the scope of\nBohr's theory, it was a necessary foundation for it and sometimes appeared\nexplicitly in the theory. For example, Bohr was able to explain the spectroscopic\nRydberg constant R in terms of fundamental constants of nature (the mass of the\nelectron m, Planck's constant h, the elementary charge e, and the speed of light c).\n\n\f20\n\nWhen it turned out that the predicted hydrogen spectrum did not agree precisely\nwith measurements, Bohr pointed out that the electron and the nucleus would both\nrotate around their common centre of mass. In this case the mass of the electron m\nshould be replaced with the so-called reduced mass\n\nwhere M is the mass of the nucleus. The result was that Rydberg's constant would\ndepend slightly on the mass of the nucleus, and with this correction the\ndisagreement vanished.\nPhysicists accepting the nuclear model generally assumed that beta\nparticles came from the rings of electrons surrounding the nucleus. This was also\nthe view of Rutherford, who distinguished between \"the instability of the central\nnucleus and the instability of the electronic distribution. The former type of\ninstability leads to the expulsion of an \u03b1\u2013particle, the latter to the appearance of \u03b2\nand \u03b3\u2013rays\" (Rutherford 1912, p. 461). However, according to Bohr it was necessary\nthat beta particles had the same origin in the nucleus as alpha particles. It was\nknown that some radioactive substances, apparently belonging to the same\nelement, emitted beta rays with different velocities. If the substances were isotopes\nthey would have the very same electron systems and only differ in their atomic\nweights, meaning their nuclei. As Bohr pointed out, this showed that beta rays\nmust have their origin in the nucleus and not in the electronic system. Bohr's\nconclusion forced Rutherford to change his mind and it soon became generally\naccepted among specialists in radioactivity.\nIn 1914 James Chadwick, one of Rutherford's former students, had shown\nthat the energy of the beta spectrum was essentially continuously distributed,\n\n\f21\n\nFigure 6. Chadwick's beta-ray spectrum of 1914, obtained by two different methods.\n\ncontrary to the discrete energies of the alpha spectrum (Figure 6). This was a result\nthat would cause a great deal of problem in physics until it was finally explained by\nthe neutrino hypothesis in the early 1930s (Jensen 2000). Rutherford thought he\ncould account for the continuous spectrum on the assumption that beta particles\nwere expelled from the nucleus. In passing through the outer distribution of\nelectrons a beta particle would collide with these electrons and share its energy\nwith them. \"As a statistical result of a large number of atoms,\" he wrote, \"the\nvelocity of the escaping \u03b2 particles will, on the average, be continuously distributed\n... [and] this would give rise to the continuous spectrum of \u03b2 rays\" (Rutherford\n1914b, p. 308). Alas, it soon turned out that Rutherford's new theory of beta\nradioactivity was no more able to explain the continuous spectrum than other\ntheories.\nRealizing that Bohr's theory provided new confirmation of the nuclear\natom, Rutherford supported it from the very beginning. However, although\nadvocating the theory he was somewhat reluctant when it came to its foundation in\n\n\f22\n\nthe postulates and its use of quantum theory. In a paper of 1914 he expressed the\nfeeling of many physicists: \"There no doubt will be much difference of opinion as\nto the validity of the assumptions made by Bohr in his theory of the constitution of\natoms and molecules, but a very promising beginning has been made on the attack\nof this most fundamental of problems, which lies at the basis of physics and\nchemistry\" (Rutherford 1914a, p. 351). Rutherford sensed that Bohr's theory broke\nwith established norms of physics, such as causality, and this made him uneasy. As\nearly as March 1913, before the publication of the theory, he responded in a letter to\nBohr's ideas about quantum jumps (Kragh 2012, p. 70):\nThere appears to me one grave difficulty in your hypothesis, which I have no\ndoubt you fully realize, namely, how does an electron decide what frequency it is\ngoing to vibrate at when it passes from one stationary state to the other? It seems\nto me that you would have to assume that the electron knows beforehand where it\nis going to stop.\n\nBohr's atomic theory was strange indeed, but it was also empirically successful and\nthe best possible support of the nuclear atom. Another very important support\ncame at the end of 1923, when Henry Moseley announced his first investigations of\nthe characteristic X-rays from a large number of elements, a line of work he had\nbegun in Manchester. Moseley's data only made sense on the assumption that a\nchemical element was defined by the positive charges in the nucleus; they showed\nthat each place in the periodic table corresponded to a change of one nuclear\ncharge. \"The results,\" he wrote, \"have an important bearing on the question of the\ninternal structure of the atom, and strongly support the views of Rutherford and of\nBohr\" (Moseley 1913, p. 1025).\nLatest by 1916 the nuclear atom, which now had become the BohrRutherford model of the atom, was generally accepted in the physics community.\n\n\f23\n\nFigure 7. The Manchester laboratory in which Rutherford made the first\nexperiments with artificial transmutations of elements.\n\n6. Speculations and artificial transmutations\nWhile Bohr continued to examine the general principles of quantum theory and\natomic structure, Rutherford focused in his work after 1915 on the secrets of the\natomic nucleus. In 1919 he left Manchester to succeed Thomson as director of the\nCavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, but before leaving he had made another\nspectacular discovery, almost as important as the transformation theory of\nradioactivity and the nuclear atom (Badash 1983; Wroblewski 2002). In December\n1917, while still engaged in some war-related work, he wrote to Bohr in\nCopenhagen: \"I am detecting & counting the lighter atoms set in motion by \u03b1\nparticles & the results, I think, throw a good deal of light on the character &\ndistribution of forces near the nucleus. I am also trying to break up the atom by this\nmethod\" (Stuewer 1986, p. 322). What he in a later letter to Bohr called \"some\n\n\f24\n\nrather startling results\" were published in the April 1919 issue of the Philosophical\nMagazine.\nIn a study of 1914 of the action of alpha particles on a hydrogen gas\nMarsden had obtained results that seemed to indicate that the radioactive source\nitself gave off hydrogen nuclei. He suspected that the hydrogen nuclei were being\nemitted along with the alpha particles. In a reinvestigation of these experiments,\nRutherford studied systematically the action of alpha particles on various gases by\ndetecting the scintillations produced by particles formed by the action (Figure 7).\nWith alpha rays from radium C (bismuth-214) passing through pure nitrogen he\nobserved what he called an anomalous effect, namely, the production of long-range\nscintillations that appeared much the same as those produced by hydrogen atoms.\nRutherford (1919, p. 586) found it\n... difficult to avoid the conclusion that these long-range atoms arising from the\ncollision of alpha particles with nitrogen are not nitrogen atoms but probably\ncharged atoms of hydrogen, or atoms of mass 2. If this be the case, we must\nconclude that the nitrogen atom is disintegrated under the intense forces\ndeveloped in close collision with a swift \u03b1 particle, and that the hydrogen atom\nwhich is liberated formed a constituent part of the nitrogen nucleus.\n\nWritten in a later notation, the process suggested by Rutherford was\n\nan example of modern alchemy! At the end of his paper, Rutherford spelled out the\nconsequences of his interpretation of the experiment as the first case of an artificial\natomic disintegration, although one performed by projectiles of natural origin:\nConsidering the enormous intensity of the forces brought into play, it is not so\nmuch a matter of surprise that the nitrogen atom should suffer disintegration as\nthat the \u03b1 particle itself escapes disruption into its constituents. The results as a\nwhole suggest that, if \u03b1 particles \u2013 or similar projectiles \u2013 of still greater energy\n\n\f25\n\nwere available for experiment, we might expect to break down the nuclear\nstructure of many of the lighter atoms.\n\nFurther work done in the Cavendish Laboratory proved that Rutherford had\nindeed achieved an artificial transmutation of one element to another, but not quite\nthe one he thought. Believing that the alpha particle was a fundamental constituent\nof matter, he could not imagine that it would itself be transformed. In 1925 Patrick\nBlackett, a junior colleague of Rutherford's and a future Nobel laureate, used the\ncloud chamber to photograph eight cases of alpha-nitrogen disintegration out of a\ntotal of 23,000 photographs with about 420,000 tracks of alpha particles. His\nphotographs showed two and not three tracks emerging from the impact point, and\nthe process was consequently reinterpreted as a nitrogen-oxygen transmutation:\n\nIn a lecture of 1925 to the Royal Institution, Rutherford (1925, p. 588) explained:\n\"He [Blackett] concluded that the \u03b1 particle was captured in a collision which led to\nthe ejection of a proton. ... It thus appears that the nucleus may increase rather than\ndiminish its mass as the result of collisions in which a proton is expelled.\"\nRutherford considered the nuclear experiments made in Manchester and\nCambridge to be of particular interest because they indicated how the atomic\nnucleus was constituted. In agreement with the so-called \"two-particle\nparadigm,\"from 1913 to about 1933 it was generally assumed that the nucleus\nconsisted of hydrogen nuclei (protons) and electrons. For example, nitrogen-14 was\nthought to consist of 14 protons and 7 electrons, and lithium-7 of 7 protons and 4\nelectrons. However, there were many ideas of other, more or less hypothetical\nconstituents. In his Bakerian lecture delivered to the Royal Society on 3 June 1920,\nRutherford offered several suggestions of new nuclear particles, although\n\n\f26\n\nFigure 8. Rutherford's\nmodels for the three\nlithium isotopes, as he\npresented them in his\n1920 Bakerian lecture.\nThe negative signs\nrepresent nuclear\nelectrons, and the circles\nwith the numbers 1, 3,\nand 4 inside represent a\nproton, an X3++ particle,\nand an alpha particle,\nrespectively.\n\nultimately these would all consist of protons and electrons. Incidentally, this was\nthe occasion at which he introduced the name \"proton\" as an alternative to\nhydrogen nucleus, hydrogen ion, or positive electron.\nAt the same occasion he advocated the existence of the \"neutron\" as a\ntightly bound composite proton-electron particle. (The name \"neutron\" had been\nproposed as early as 1899, but Rutherford may have been unaware of it and he only\nused the name in 1921.) \"Such an atom,\" he said, \"would have very novel\nproperties. ... It should enter readily the structure of atoms, and may either unite\nwith the nucleus or be disintegrated by its intense field, resulting possibly in the\nescape of a charged H atom or an electron or both\" (Rutherford 1920, p. 34). And\nthis was not all, for he also suggested that there was experimental evidence for a\nlight helium nucleus consisting of three protons bound by one electron. We would\ndenote such a particle 3He, but Rutherford used the notation\n\n. Moreover, he saw\n\nno reason why a heavy hydrogen isotope (2H) consisting of two protons and one\nelectron \u2013 a deuteron in later terminology \u2013 should not exist (Figure 8). A couple of\n\n\f27\n\nquotations from the 1920 Bakerian lecture may serve to illustrate Rutherford's\nideas:\nIn considering the possible constitution of the elements, it is natural to suppose\nthat they are built up ultimately of hydrogen nuclei and electrons. ... We have\nshown that atoms of mass about 3 carrying two positive charges are liberated by\n\u03b1\u2013particles both from nitrogen and oxygen, and it is natural to suppose that these\natoms are independent units in the structure of both gases. ... We have seen that\nso far the nuclei of three light atoms have been recognized experimentally as\nprobable units of atomic structure, viz.,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n, where the subscript\n\nrepresents the mass of the element.\n\nRutherford's ideas of the structure of the nucleus were admittedly speculative and,\nhe emphasized, \"purely illustrative.\" He nonetheless took them seriously and\ncontinued for several years to develop them into an elaborate \"satellite\" model of\nthe atomic nucleus. According to this model, the nucleus consisted of a massive\ncore surrounded by proton and electron satellites as well as neutral satellites\nconsisting of these two particles (Stuewer 1986). He believed that the satellite model\nexplained not only the disintegration of light nuclei but also natural radioactivity,\nand found it important enough to include it in Radiations from Radioactive substances,\na book published in 1930 and written with Chadwick and Charles Ellis. However,\nat that time it was realized that the satellite model was a blind alley and that no\nproper understanding of the internal structure of the atomic nucleus had been\nachieved by the large amount of work done through the 1920s.\nOnly in 1932, with Chadwick's discovery of the real neutron \u2013 an\nelementary particle and not a proton-electron composite \u2013 did physicists slowly\nbegin to understand the nucleus that Rutherford had discovered more than twenty\nyears earlier. And they realized that the nucleus, and the atom as a whole, could\nonly be understood on the basis of the new quantum mechanics. Rutherford, on the\n\n\f28\n\nother hand, largely ignored quantum theory in his extensive investigations of\nradioactivity and nuclear physics. It was not a kind of theory he appreciated.\n\n7. Concluding remark\nRutherford continued to contribute to the frontier of nuclear physics until his death\nin 1937. Following the discovery in 1932 of deuterium, the mass-2 isotope of\nhydrogen, he engaged in a research programme with the aim of finding the\nsuspected mass-3 isotope (tritium) or its nucleus, called the triton. From a historical\npoint of view it is interesting that the possible existence of tritium was suggested as\nearly as 1913, when Bohr made the suggestion at the Birmingham meeting of the\nBritish Association for the Advancement of Science (Kragh 2011; Kragh 2012, p. 97).\nHe even tried to detect it by means of spectroscopy, but in vain.\nAbout twenty years later Rutherford and his Cavendish group took up the\nquestion, which they did by bombarding deuterium atoms with accelerated\ndeuterons. They hoped to detect the reaction\n\nbut were unable to confirm the presence of tritons. In his very last scientific paper,\nRutherford (1937) carefully evaluated the evidence for and against tritium,\nconcluding that although tritons had probably been detected in nuclear reactions,\ntritium had not been obtained in such quantities that its properties could be studied\nby ordinary physical and chemical methods. Two years later tritium was\ndiscovered in a cyclotron experiment, produced by means of the same deuterondeuteron process and identified by its beta decay into helium-3 (Eidinoff 1948).\n\n\f29\n\nLiterature\nBadash, Lawrence, ed.
