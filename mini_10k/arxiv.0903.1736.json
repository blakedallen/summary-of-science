It is of particular importance in quantum information and quantum-optical realizations of strongly interacting many-body systems. The\ninteraction strength between single photons and quantum dipole oscillators is determined by the value of the\nelectromagnetic field at the position of the oscillator and\nthus by the spatial confinement of the photons. This\nhas lead to the development of cavity quantum electrodynamics where strong confinement and thus strong coupling is achieved by means of low-loss micro-resonators\n[1]. An alternative suggested by Andre and Lukin [2] and\nfirst implemented in a proof-of-principle experiment by\nBajcsy et al. [3], is to create spatially confined quasistationary pulses of light with very low losses by means\nof electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) [4, 5]\nin an ensemble of \u039b-type three-level atoms driven by two\ncounter-propagating control fields. The physical properties of stationary light were discussed in a number of theoretical studies. It was shown that under adiabatic conditions quasi-stationary light obeys a Schr\u00f6dinger equation with complex mass and that inhomogeneous control\nfields can be used to spatially confine and compress its\nwave-packet [6]. The fundamental quasi-particles of stationary light have been identified [7], a transition from a\nSchr\u00f6dinger-like to a Dirac-like dynamics has been found\n[8] and many-body phenomena with stationary-light polaritons have been discussed theoretically such as the\nTonks gas transition [9] and Bose-Einstein condensation\n[10].\nAn essential assumption of the original model for stationary light is the secular approximation in which spatial\nmodulations of the ground-state coherence of the \u039b-type\natoms with wavenumbers on the order of the optical fields\nand its harmonics are neglected. The latter is a very good\napproximation in warm gases, where atomic motion leads\nto a fast dephasing of fast spatial oscillations. It fails\nhowever for cold gases or other systems where the motion is suppressed such as solids [11] or atoms in optical\nlattices [12, 13]. Although the problem of a secular ap-\n\nproximation can be entirely avoided by using a double-\u039b\nrather than a \u039b transition [7, 14], it is interesting to consider the dynamics in a cold gas of \u039b-type atoms without\nthe secular approximation. The earliest analysis of this\ncase was done by Moiseev and Ham [15]. However their\nanalysis was limited to the case of unequal coupling field\nintensities, thus the probe field was not really stationary. In a more recent study M\u00f8lmer and Hansen found\nthat without secular approximation the wave-packet of\nlight is truly stationary for equal strength of the control\nfield, i.e. does not undergo a diffusive spreading, and\nthe only source of photon loss is the finite lifetime of the\nground-state coherence [16]. In this analysis radiative\nlosses where neglected however. The result obtained in\n[16] predicts the possibility of light trapping in EIT media with unprecendented Q factors. In the present paper\nwe analyze stationary light in \u039b-type media without the\nsecular approximation by taking into account the relaxation of the excited state. We prove that the unavoidable\nexcited-state decay limits the lifetime of the probe field\nin the medium. It leads either to a broadening of the\nquasi-stationary wavepacket in time or a splitting into\ntwo pulses [17] depending on the system parameters. The\ngeneral dynamical behaviour is non-trivial, leading e.g.\nto a non-exponential decay of photons from the initial\nvolume. We identify parameter regimes in which the effective loss in cold gases is slower or faster than the one\nin a warm gas where the secular approximation holds.\n\nII.\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS OF STATIONARY\nLIGHT BEYOND THE SECULAR\nAPPROXIMATION\n\nWe here consider a medium consisting of an ensemble\nof non-moving three-level atoms with a \u039b configuration\nshown in Fig.1. We assume that initially some coherence\nis stored in the lower levels of the atomic medium, so\nthat when a standing wave resonant coupling field \u03a9c\nis applied, a quasi-stationary probe field E is created.\nFor simplicity the states |gi and |si are assumed to be\ndegenerate, thus the wave vectors of the probe and the\ncoupling fields have equal magnitude k.\n\n\f2\n\u03c3\u0302ge and equations (2) are reduced to\n\u0393\u03c3\u0302ge = igE + i\u03a9c \u03c3\u0302gs\n\u2202t \u03c3\u0302gs = i\u03a9\u2217c \u03c3\u0302ge .\n\n(4)\n\nDifferentiating the first equation with respect to time and\nassuming a constant control field \u03a9c yields\n\u2202t \u03c3\u0302ge =\n\n|\u03a9c |2\nig\n\u2202t E \u2212\n\u03c3\u0302ge ,\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\nwhich has the formal solution\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2202E\n|\u03a9c |2\nexp \u2212\n(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) d\u03c4\n\u2202\u03c4\n\u0393\n0\n\u001a\n\u001b\n|\u03a9c |2\n\u03a9c\nt .\n(5)\n+i \u03c3\u0302gs (z, 0) exp \u2212\n\u0393\n\u0393\n\nig\n\u03c3\u0302ge (z, t) =\n\u0393\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Schematic diagram of the three-level\natomic system and the medium pumped by a standing wave\ncoupling field.\n\nThe interaction Hamiltonian in rotating wave approximation reads\nX\n\u0001\nj\nj\n+ H.c.,\n(1)\ngE \u03c3\u0302eg\n+ \u03a9c \u03c3\u0302es\n\u0124 = \u2212~\nj\n\nwhere E is the dimensionless slowly-varying complex amplitude of the probe field, g is the atom field coupling\nconstant, \u03a9c is the Rabi frequency of the coupling field,\nj\nand \u03c3\u0302\u03bc\u03bd\n= |\u03bcijj h\u03bd| are the atomic transition operators of\nthe jth atom between states |\u03bci and |\u03bdi. The atom dynamics is governed by Langevin equations corresponding\nto (1) and including losses from the excited state. They\ncan be written as\n\u2202t \u03c3\u0302ge = \u2212\u0393\u03c3\u0302ge + igE(\u03c3\u0302gg \u2212 \u03c3\u0302ee ) + i\u03a9c \u03c3\u0302gs ,\n\u2202t \u03c3\u0302gs = i\u03a9\u2217c \u03c3\u0302ge + igE \u03c3\u0302es ,\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nwhere \u0393 is the relaxation rate of the upper level and it\nis assumed that the decoherence of the lower-level transition is negligible on the time scale of interest. In the\nlimit of low probe-field intensities (|gE| \u226a |\u03a9c |) and for\nan initial preparation of the ensemble in the ground state\n|gi, we can set in eq.(2) \u03c3\u0302gg \u2248 1\u0302; \u03c3\u0302ss = \u03c3\u0302ee = \u03c3\u0302se = 0,\nwhich corresponds to the well-known pertubative linearresponse limit. Since losses are included in the above\nequations there should be in general Langevin noise operators [18]. The noise operators are however inconsequential since in the linear-response limit, considered here,\nthere is no excitation of the excited states. Thus they\nare neglected. We assume furthermore, that the characteristic duration of interaction T is long compared with\nrespect to the upper level relaxation (\u0393T \u226b 1). This allows for an adiabatic elimination of the optical coherence\n\nZt\n\nSince the coupling field is a standing wave formed by two\ncounterpropagating fields of equal intensity and polarization, it can be expressed as \u03a9c (z) = 2\u03a9 cos (kz), where\n\u03a9 represents the amplitude of the coupling field. The\nprobe field consists also of two counterpropagating components E = E+ eikz + E\u2212 e\u2212ikz . Due to the presence of\n|\u03a9c (z)|2 in the exponents in eq.5, the optical coherence\nand thus by virtue of eq.4 also the ground-state coherence will develop all harmonics of e\u00b1ikz . Thus we make\nthe ansatz\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03c3\u0302gs (z, t) =\n\u03c3\u0302ge (z, t) =\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nX\n\n(n)\n\u03c3\u0302gs\n(z, t) eiknz ,\n\n(6)\n\n(n)\n\u03c3\u0302ge\n(z, t) eiknz .\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nThe secular approximation corresponds to disregarding\nall terms in \u03c3\u0302gs with n 6= 0. This is justified in a hot gas\nwhere atomic motion washes out the fast spatial oscilla(n)\ntions associated with terms \u03c3\u0302gs and n 6= 0 [2],[6].\nThe propagation of the probe pulse components are\ngoverned by the Maxwell equations for the slowly varying\nfield amplitudes\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2202\n(\u00b11)\nE\u00b1 = igN \u03c3\u0302ge\n.\n(7)\n\u00b1c\n\u2202t\n\u2202z\n(\u00b11)\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302ge are the components of atomic coherence between levels |gi and |ei that oscillate in space according\nto e\u00b1ikz , and N is the number density of atoms.\nIf the stationary light pulse is generated from a stored\nspin coherence without rapidly oscillating components,\n(\u00b1n)\ni.e. for \u03c3gs (z, t = 0) = 0, for n 6= 0 the corresponding\ninitial conditions are\n\u00b11\n\u0393\u03c3\u0302ge\n(z, 0) = i\u03a9 \u03c3\u0302gs (z, 0),\n\u00b1n\n\u03c3\u0302ge\n(z, 0)\n\n= 0,\n\nfor n 6= 1.\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nUsing the identity eA cos z =\n\n\u221e\nP\n\nI|n| (A) cos (zn) =\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\u221e\nP\n\nizn\n\nI|n| (A) e\n\n, with In being the nth order modified\n\nwhere tan2 \u03b8 = g 2 N/\u03a92 .

Thus stationary light in cold gases or solids\ndoes not provide a perfect cavity. Secondly the decay of\nthe intensity can either be slower or faster as compared\nto the case with secular approximation. In the first case,\ni.e. Fig.3 the evolution of the field distribution is very\nsimilar to the diffusive spreading but much slower than\nin the secular-approximation limit shown in Fig.5. On\nthe other hand in the second case (see Fig.4), two pulse\ncomponents emerge which propagate with the group velocity vgr = c cos2 \u03b8 with some additional loss [17].\nWe now want to give a qualititative explanation of the\ndifferent dynamics in the two cases, which is due to the\ndifferent action of the integral kernels f\u00b1 in eqs.(13) and\n(14). For this it is instructive to perform a Laplacetransform of eqs.(13) and (14):\n\u0010\n\u0011\ned = \u2212fe\u2212 (s) * sE\nes \u2212 Es (0) ,(19)\nes \u2212 Es (0) + \u2202\u03be E\nsE\n\u0010\n\u0011\nes = \u2212fe+ (s) * sE\ned \u2212 Ed (0) ,(20)\ned \u2212 Ed (0) + \u2202\u03be E\nsE\nwhere the Laplace transform of f\u00b1 reads\n\u0014r\n\u0015\n1\na\ne\nf+ (s) =\n2 +1\u22121 ,\na\ns\n\"\n#\n1\n1\n\u2212p a\nfe\u2212 (s) =\n+1 .\na\n2s + 1\n\ned \u2212 Ed (0) = \u2212\nsE\n\ned\n\u2202\u03be E\n,\n1 + fe\u2212 (s)\nes\n\u2202\u03be E\n.\n1 + fe+ (s)\n\n1.\n\nlimit of small a\n\nAssuming that a is small, a series expansion of 1/(1 +\ne\nf\u00b1 (s)) yields\ns\n1\n\u2248\ne\ns\n+\n1\n1 + f\u00b1 (s)\n\nFor the slow time evolution, i.e. for (physical) times large\ncompared to (g 2 N/\u0393)\u22121 only values of s \u226a 1 are relevant, and thus the right hand side can be replaced by s.\nSubstituting this into eqs.(19) and (20) one arrives at\n\u2202\u03be2 Es \u2212 Es = \u2212 (Es (\u03be, 0) + \u2202\u03be Ed (\u03be, 0)) ,\n\u2202\u03be2 Ed \u2212 Ed = \u2212 (Ed (\u03be, 0) + \u2202\u03be Es (\u03be, 0)) ,\nwhich describes truly stationary wave packets that decay\nexponentially with increasing distance. That there is no\ndynamics is of course due to the fact that only the leading\norder term in the expansion of 1/(1 + fe\u00b1) was taken into\naccount.\n\nThis yields\n\nes \u2212 Es (0) = \u2212\nsE\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) Spatio-temporal dynamics of sum Es\n(a) and difference Ed \u00d7 10 (b) modes of the probe field, as\nwell as field component E+ (c), corresponding to the bottom\ncurve in Fig.2, i.e. tan2 \u03b8 = 1.

A numerical as well as approximate analytical solution showed that for small coupling field intensities the probe field spreading is slower\nthan in the secular approximation but in contrast to the\nresults of [16] non-zero. In the opposite limit of strong\ncoupling the probe pulse splits into two counterpropagating components.\nG.N. acknowledges support by the Alexander von\nHumboldt Foundation.\n\nMod.
