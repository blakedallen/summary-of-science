For\neach vertex x \u2208 V (G), let NG (x) = {y \u2208 V (G) : xy \u2208 E(G)}, NG [x] = NG (x) \u222a {x},\nand EG (x) = {xy : y \u2208 NG (x)}. The cardinality |EG (x)| is the degree of x, denoted by\ndG (x). For two disjoint nonempty and proper subsets S and T in V (G), we use EG (S, T )\nto denote the set of edges between S and T in G, and G[S] to denote a subgraph of G\ninduced by S.\nA subset D \u2286 V is a dominating set of G if NG (x) \u2229 D 6= \u2205 for every vertex x in\nG\u2212D. The domination number of G, denoted by \u03b3(G), is the minimum cardinality of all\ndominating sets of G. The Roman dominating function on G, proposed by Cockayne et\nal. [1], is a function f : V \u2192 {0, 1, 2} such that each vertex xP\nwith f (x) = 0 is adjacent to\nat least one vertex y with f (y) = 2. For S \u2286 V let f (S) =\nf (u). The value f (V (G))\nu\u2208S\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nThe work was supported by NNSF of China (No. 11071233).\nCorresponding author: xujm@ustc.edu.cn\n\n\fis called the weight of f , denoted by f (G). The Roman domination number, denoted by\n\u03b3R (G), is defined as the minimum weight of all Roman dominating functions, that is,\n\u03b3R (G) = min{f (G) : f is a Roman dominating function on G}.\nA Roman dominating function f is called a \u03b3R -function if f (G) = \u03b3R (G). Roman\ndomination numbers have been studied, see, for example [1, 2, 4\u20139, 11, 12, 14].\nTo measure the vulnerability or the stability of the domination in an interconnection\nnetwork under edge failure, Fink et at. [3] proposed the concept of the bondage number\nin 1990. The bondage number, denoted by b(G), of G is the minimum number of edges\nwhose removal from G results in a graph with larger domination number of G.\nThe Roman bondage number, denoted by bR (G) and proposed first by Rad and Volkmann [10], of a nonempty graph G is the minimum number of edges whose removal from\nG results in a graph with larger Roman domination number. Precisely speaking, the\nRoman bondage number\nbR (G) = min{|B| : B \u2286 E(G), \u03b3R (G \u2212 B) > \u03b3R (G)}.\nAn edge set B that \u03b3R (G \u2212 B) > \u03b3R (G) is called the Roman bondage set and the\nminimum one the minimum Roman bondage set. In [6], the authors showed that the\ndecision problem for bR (G) is NP-hard even for bipartite graphs.\nFor a complete t-partite graph Km1 ,m2 ,...,mt , its bondage number determined by Fink\net al. [3] for the undirected case and by Zhang et al. [15] for the directed case. Motivated\nby these results, we, in this paper, consider its Roman bondage number. For a complete\nt-partite undirected graph Km1 ,m2 ,...,mt with m1 = m2 = . . . = mi < mi+1 \u2264 . . . \u2264 mt\nt\nP\nand n =\nmj , we determine that\nj=1\n\n\uf8f1 i\n\u230a2\u230b\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 2\ni\nbR (Km1 ,m2 ,...,mt ) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nn\n\u22121\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nn \u2212 mt\n\nif\nif\nif\nif\nif\n\nmi\nmi\nmi\nmi\nmi\n\n=1\n=2\n=2\n=3\n\u22653\n\nand\nand\nand\nand\nand\n\nn \u2265 3;\ni = 1;\ni \u2265 2;\ni = t \u2265 3;\nmt \u2265 4.\n\nConsider K3,3,...,3 of order n \u2265 9, which is an (n \u2212 3)-regular graph. The above result\nmeans that bR (K3,3,...,3 ) = n \u2212 1. In this paper, we further determine that bR (G) = n \u2212 2\nfor any (n \u2212 3)-regular graph G of order n \u2265 5 and G 6= K3,3,...,3 .\nIn the proofs of our results, when a Roman dominating function of a graph is constructed, we only give its nonzero value of some vertices.\nFor terminology and notation on graph theory not given here, the reader is referred\nto Xu [13].\n\n2\n\nPreliminary results\n\nLemma 2.1 (Cockayne et al. [1]) For a complete t-partite graph Km1 ,m2 ,...,mt with 1 \u2264\nm1 \u2264 m2 \u2264 . . . \u2264 mt and t \u2265 2,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 2, if m1 = 1;\n3, if m1 = 2;\n\u03b3R (Km1 ,m2 ,...,mt ) =\n\uf8f3\n4, if m1 \u2265 3.\n\n\fLemma 2.2 (Hu and Xu [6]) Let G be a graph of order n \u2265 3 and t be the number of\nvertices of degree n \u2212 1 in G. If t \u2265 1, then bR (G) = \u2308 2t \u2309.\nLemma 2.3 (Hu and Xu [6]) Let G be a nonempty graph of order n \u2265 3, then \u03b3R (G) = 3\nif and only if \u2206(G) = n \u2212 2.\nLemma 2.4 Let G be an (n \u2212 3)-regular graph of order n \u2265 4. Then \u03b3R (G) = 4.\nProof. Since G is an (n \u2212 3)-regular graph and n \u2265 4, G is nonempty. Let f be a\nminimum Roman dominating function of G. If there is no vertex x such that f (x) = 2,\nthen f (y) = 1 for every vertex y. Therefore, \u03b3R (G) = f (G) \u2265 4. Assume that there is\nsome vertex x with f (x) = 2. Let u and v be the only two vertices not adjacent to x in\nG. If f (u) = 0 or f (v) = 0, then there exists a vertex y 6= x adjacent to u or v in G such\nthat f (y) = 2 and hence \u03b3R (G) = f (G) \u2265 f (x) + f (y) = 4. If f (u) \u2265 1 and f (v) \u2265 1,\nthen \u03b3R (G) = f (G) \u2265 f (x) + f (u) + f (v) \u2265 4. In the following, we prove \u03b3R (G) \u2264 4.\nFor any vertex x, let y and z be the only two vertices not adjacent to x in G. Denote\nf (x) = 2 and f (y) = f (z) = 1. Then, f is a Roman dominating function of G with\nf (G) = 4, and hence \u03b3R (G) \u2264 4. Thus, \u03b3R (G) = 4.\nLemma 2.5 Let G be an (n\u22123)-regular graph of order n \u2265 5 and B be a Roman bondage\nset of G. Then EG (x) \u2229 B 6= \u2205 for any x \u2208 V (G).\nProof. By Lemma 2.4, \u03b3R (G) = 4. Let G\u2032 = G\u2212B. Then \u03b3R (G\u2032 ) > 4 since B is a Roman\nbondage set in G. By contradiction, assume EG (x)\u2229B = \u2205 for some x \u2208 V (G). Let y and\nz be the only two vertices not adjacent to x in G. Denote f (x) = 2 and f (y) = f (z) = 1.\nSince every u \u2208\n/ {x, y, z} is adjacent to x, f is a Roman dominating function of G\u2032 with\n\u2032\nf (G ) = 4. Thus we obtain a contradiction as follows. \u03b3R (G\u2032 ) \u2264 f (G\u2032 ) = 4 < \u03b3R (G\u2032 ).\nLemma 2.6 Let G be an (n\u22123)-regular graph of order n \u2265 5 and B be a Roman bondage\nset of G, x be any vertex, y and z be the only two vertices not adjacent to x in G. If\nEG (x)\u2229B = {xw}, then |EG ({y, z, w}, x\u2032)\u2229B| \u2265 1 for any vertex x\u2032 \u2208 V (G)\\{x, y, z, w}\nthat is adjacent to each vertex in {y, z, w} in G.\nProof. Since EG (x) \u2229 B 6= \u2205 by Lemma 2.5, there is a vertex w such that xw \u2208\nEG (x) \u2229 B. Let G\u2032 = G \u2212 B. Then \u03b3R (G\u2032 ) > 4 by Lemma 2.4. By contradiction, suppose\nEG ({y, z, w}, x\u2032) \u2229 B = \u2205 for some vertex x\u2032 \u2208 V (G) \\ {x, y, z, w} that is adjacent to each\nin {y, z, w} in G. Set f (x) = f (x\u2032 ) = 2. Then, f is a Roman dominating function of G\u2032\nwith f (G\u2032 ) = 4 since NG\u2032 [x] \u222a NG\u2032 [x\u2032 ] = V (G), a contradiction.\nLemma 2.7 Let G be an (n\u22123)-regular graph of order n \u2265 6 and B be a Roman bondage\nset of G. For three vertices x, y and z that are pairwise non-adjacent in G, if each of\nthem is incident with exact one edge in B, then |B| \u2265 n \u2212 2 and, moreover, |B| \u2265 n \u2212 1\nif G = K3,3,...,3 .\nProof. By the hypothesis, for any v \u2208 {x, y, z}, |EG (v) \u2229 B| = 1 and v is adjacent to\nevery vertex in V (G \u2212 {x, y, z, v}). Let xu \u2208 EG (x) \u2229 B. We claim yu \u2208 EG (y) \u2229 B\nand zu \u2208 EG (z) \u2229 B. In fact, by contradiction, without loss of generality suppose\nyv \u2208 EG (y) \u2229 B and zw \u2208 EG (z) \u2229 B with u 6= v and u 6= w. Then, u is adjacent to y\n\n\fand z in G \u2212 B. Set f (x) = f (u) = 2. Then f is a Roman dominating function of G\nwith f (G \u2212 B) = 4, which contradicts with \u03b3R (G \u2212 B) > 4 by Lemma 2.4.\nLet s and t be the only two vertices not adjacent to u in G, and let V \u2032 = V (G) \\\n{x, y, z, u, s, t}. By the hypothesis, each vertex in {y, z, u} is adjacent to all vertices in\nV \u2032 in G.

Let {X1 , X2 , . . . , Xt } be the corresponding t-partitions of V (G).\n(1) If mi = 1 and n \u2265 3, then G has i vertices of degree n \u2212 1, and so bR (G) = \u2308 2i \u2309\nby Lemma 2.2.\n(2) If mi = 2, then \u2206(G) = n \u2212 2. By Lemma 2.1, \u03b3R (G) = 3. Let B \u2286 E(G) be a\nRoman bondage set of G with |B| = bR (G) and G\u2032 = G \u2212 B. Then \u03b3R (G\u2032 ) > \u03b3R (G) = 3,\nand so \u2206(G\u2032 ) \u2264 n \u2212 3 by Lemma 2.3. Thus, |B \u2229 EG (x)| \u2265 1 for every vertex in Xj\n(1 \u2264 j \u2264 i), that is, |B| \u2265 2 if i = 1 and |B| \u2265 i if i > 1.\nIf i = 1, then only two vertices of degree n \u2212 2 are in X1 , and the removal of any two\nedges incident with distinct vertices in X1 results in a graph G\u2032\u2032 with \u2206(G\u2032\u2032 ) \u2264 n \u2212 3,\nand hence \u03b3R (G\u2032\u2032 ) 6= 3 by Lemma 2.3. Since \u03b3R (G\u2032\u2032 ) \u2265 \u03b3R (G) = 3, \u03b3R (G\u2032\u2032 ) \u2265 4. Thus,\nbR (G) \u2264 2 and hence bR (G) = 2.\ni\nS\nIf i > 1, then the subgraph H induced by\nXj of G is a complete i-partite graph\nj=1\n\nwith each partition consisting of two vertices, which is 2-edge-connected and 2(i \u2212 1)regular, and so has a perfect matching M with |M| = i. Thus, G \u2212 M has the maximum\ndegree n \u2212 3 and hence \u03b3R (G \u2212 M) 6= 3 by Lemma 2.3. Since \u03b3R (G \u2212 M) \u2265 \u03b3R (G) = 3,\n\u03b3R (G \u2212 M) \u2265 4. Thus, bR (G) \u2264 |M| = i, and so bR (G) = i.\n(3) Assume mi = 3 and i = t. Then G is (n \u2212 3)-regular. Note that if t = 2\nthen n = 6 and bR (K3,3 ) = 4 = n \u2212 2. It is easy to verify that the conclusion is\ntrue for t = 3, 4, and assume t \u2265 5 below. Let x \u2208 V (G) and H = G \u2212 EG (x),\nthen \u03b3R (H) = 1 + \u03b3R (K2,3,...,3 ) = 4 by Lemma 2.1. By the conclusion (2) just showed,\nbR (K2,3,...,3 ) = 2 and hence\nbR (G) \u2264 |EG (x)| + bR (K2,3,...,3 ) = (n \u2212 3) + 2 = n \u2212 1.\nWe now prove that bR (G) \u2265 n \u2212 1. By contradiction. Assume that there is a Roman\nbondage set B of G such that |B| \u2264 n \u2212 2. Let G\u2032 = G \u2212 B. Then \u03b3R (G\u2032 ) > \u03b3R (G) = 4\nby Lemma 2.1, and |EG (x) \u2229 B| \u2265 1 for any vertex x \u2208 V (G) by Lemma 2.5. If\n|EG (x) \u2229 B| \u2265 2 for any vertex x \u2208 V (G), then the subgraph induced by B has the\nminimum degree at least two, and so |B| \u2265 n, a contradiction. Thus, there is a vertex\nx1 in G such that |EG (x1 ) \u2229 B| = 1. Let x1 y1 \u2208 B and, without loss of generality, let\nX1 = {x1 , x2 , x3 } and X2 = {y1 , y2, y3 }. By Lemma 2.8,\n|E(G[{y1 , x2 , x3 }]) \u2229 B| \u2265 1,\n\n(3.1)\n\n|EG (y2 ) \u2229 B| \u2265 1 and |EG (y3 ) \u2229 B| \u2265 1.\n\n(3.2)\n\nand by Lemma 2.5,\nLet V1 = V (G) \\ (X1 \u222a X2 ).

The worst case is that u and\nv belong to different partitions of X3 , . . . , Xt . Since t \u2265 5, there exists some i with\n3 \u2264 i \u2264 t such that both u and v are not belong to Xi . Thus, each vertex in Xi is\nincident with exact one edge in B. By Lemma 2.7, |B| \u2265 n \u2212 1, a contradiction.\nThus, bR (K3,3,...,3 ) = n \u2212 1.\n(4) We now assume mi \u2265 3 and mt \u2265 4. By Lemma 2.1, we have \u03b3R (G) = 4. Let u\nbe a vertex in Xt and f be a \u03b3R -function of G \u2212 EG (u). Then u is an isolated vertex.\nThus, f (u) = 1 and f (G \u2212 u) = 4 by Lemma 2.1 since G \u2212 u is a complete t-partite\ngraph with at least 3 vertices in every partition. Thus \u03b3R (G \u2212 EG (u)) = 5 > 4 = \u03b3R (G),\nand hence bR (G) \u2264 |EG (u)| = n \u2212 mt .\nWe now show bR (G) \u2265 n \u2212 mt . Let B be a minimum Roman bondage set of G, and\nlet G\u2032 = G \u2212 B. Then \u03b3R (G\u2032 ) > \u03b3R (G) = 4.\nAssume that there is a vertex x in G such that EG (x) \u2229 B = \u2205.

Then f is a Roman dominating function of G\u2032\nwith f (G\u2032 ) = 4, a contradiction. Thus,\nEG (y, Xj ) \u2229 B 6= \u2205 for any y \u2208 V (G \u2212 Xj ).\nIt follows that\n|B| \u2265 |V (G) \\ Xj | = n \u2212 mj \u2265 n \u2212 mt .\nWe now assume that\n|EG (x) \u2229 B| \u2265 1 for any x \u2208 V (G).\n\n(3.6)\n\nIf |EG (x) \u2229 B| \u2265 2 for any x \u2208 V (G), then the subgraph induced by B has the\nminimum degree at least two, from which we have |B| \u2265 n > n \u2212 mt .\nWe suppose that there exists a vertex x1 \u2208 V (G) such that |EG (x1 ) \u2229 B| = 1.\nLet x1 \u2208 Xj and x2 , x3 , . . . , xmj be the other vertices of Xj .

By Lemma 2.6, |EG ({w, y, z}, x\u2032)\u2229B| \u2265 1\nfor any vertex x\u2032 \u2208 X1 = V (G) \\ {x, y, z, w, p, q}, and so |EG ({w, y, z}, X1) \u2229 B| \u2265\n|X1 | = n \u2212 6. Then,\nn \u2212 3 \u2265 |B| \u2265 |{xw}| + |EG ({w, y, z}, X1) \u2229 B|\n+|E(G[{y, z, w}]) \u2229 B| + |(EG (p) \u222a EG (q)) \u2229 B|\n\u2265 1 + (n \u2212 6) + 1 + 1\n= n \u2212 3.\n\n(4.3)\n\nIt follows that the equalities in (4.3) hold, which implies that |EG ({p, q}) \u2229 B| = 1.\nThen (EG (p) \u222a EG (q)) \u2229 B = {pq} and then, EG (p) \u2229 B = EG (q) \u2229 B = {pq}. By\nLemma 4.2, |B| \u2265 n \u2212 2, a contradiction.\nCase 2 yz \u2208 E(G).\nLet r and s be the only vertex except x not adjacent to y and z in G, respectively.\nBy Lemma 2.8, |E(G[{w, y, z}])\u2229B| \u2265 2. By Lemma 2.6, |EG ({w, y, z}, x\u2032)\u2229B| \u2265 1\nfor any vertex x\u2032 \u2208 X2 = V (G) \\ {x, y, z, w, p, q, r, s}. Thus, we have that\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 n \u2212 6 if |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| \u2264 2;\nn \u2212 7 if |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| = 3;\n|EG ({w, y, z}, X2) \u2229 B| \u2265 |X2 | \u2265\n(4.4)\n\uf8f3\nn \u2212 8 if |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| = 4,\nand\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 1\n|(EG (p) \u222a EG (q) \u222a EG (r) \u222a EG (s)) \u2229 B| \u2265\n2\n\uf8f3\n2\n\nif |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| \u2264 2;\nif |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| = 3;\nif |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| = 4,\n\n(4.5)\n\nIt follows from (4.4) and (4.5) that\n\nn \u2212 3 \u2265 |B| \u2265 |{xw}| + |EG ({w, y, z}, X2) \u2229 B| + |E(G[{w, y, z}]) \u2229 B|\n\u001a +|(EG (p) \u222a EG (q) \u222a EG (r) \u222a EG (s)) \u2229 B|\nn \u2212 2 if |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| \u2264 3;\n\u2265\nn \u2212 3 if |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| = 4.\n\n(4.6)\n\nThe Eq. (4.6) implies that |{r, s} \u222a {p, q}| = 4, |B| = n \u2212 3 and |(EG (p) \u222a EG (q) \u222a\nEG (r) \u222a EG (s)) \u2229 B| = 2. Then there exist two vertices u, v in {p, q, r, s} such that\nEG (u) \u2229 B = EG (v) \u2229 B = {uv}. By Lemma 4.2, |B| \u2265 n \u2212 2, a contradiction.\nThus, bR (G) = n \u2212 2, and so the theorem follows.\n\nReferences\n[1] E. J. Cockayne, P.A. Dreyer, Jr., S.M. Hedetniemi, S.T.
