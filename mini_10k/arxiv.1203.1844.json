Castelo Ferreira\nAbstract\nIn this work are computed analytical solutions for orbital motion on a\nbackground described by an Expanding Locally Anisotropic (ELA) metric ansatz. This metric interpolates between the Schwarzschild metric\nnear the central mass and the Robertson-Walker metric describing the expanding cosmological background far from the central mass allowing for a\nfine-tuneable covariant parameterization of gravitational interactions corrections in between these two asymptotic limits. In particular it is shown\nthat the decrease of the Sun's mass by radiation emission plus the General\nRelativity corrections due to the ELA metric background with respect to\nSchwarzschild backgrounds can be mapped to the reported yearly variation of the gravitational constant \u0120 through Kepler's third law. Based on\nthe value of the heuristic fit corresponding to the more recent heliocentric\nephemerides of the Solar System are derived bounds for the value of a constant parameter \u03b10 for the ELA metric as well as the maximal corrections\nto perihelion advance and orbital radii variation within this framework.\nHence it is shown that employing the ELA metric as a functional covariant parameterization to model gravitational interactions corrections\nwithin the Solar System allows to maintain the measurement projection\nstandards constant over time, specifically both the Astronomical Unit\n(AU ) and the Gravitational constant (G). Also it is noted that the effect\nobtained is not homogeneous for all planetary orbits consistently with the\ndiversity of estimates in the literature obtained assuming Schwarzschild\nbackgrounds.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nIntroduction\nMotivation\n\nIn this work our main objective is to employ a background described by an\nexpanding locally anisotropic (ELA) metric [1, 2] to analytically model the\ncorrections to orbital motion with respect to orbital motion on a Schwarzschild\nbackground within the Solar System. In particular, based in analytical orbital\nsolutions for the background described by the ELA metric we will explicitly\ncompute the respective corrections to the orbital period due to two distinct\ncontributions, both the Sun's mass decrease corrections and the corrections\nobtained when considering expanding backgrounds [3]. In particular it is shown\nthat, when considering a expanding background described by the ELA metric, it\nis possible to map these corrections to the heuristic variation of the gravitational\nconstant \u0120, simultaneously having negligible contributions to the remaining\n\n1\n\n\forbital parameters. Considering the most recent estimate for the average value\n \u0307 \u2299 = \u0120\u00d7M\u2299 +G\u00d7 \u1e40\u2299 obtained from the numerical analysis\nof the variation GM\nof planetary ephemerides [4] we will compute bounds for the values of the metric\nfunctional parameter which, in turn, will allow to estimate the contributions due\nto the ELA metric background to the orbital period, orbital perihelion advance\nand orbital radius variation of the several planets within the Solar System.\nThe ansatz for the Expanding Locally Anisotropic (ELA) metric [1] was\noriginally suggested as a possible description of local matter distributions in the\nexpanding universe [5, 6], hence interpolating between the Schwarzschild (SC)\nmetric [7] near the central mass and the Robertson-Walker (RW) metric [8]\ndescribing the expanding cosmological background far from the central mass.\nHence the ELA metric generalizes the isotropic McVittie metric [9] and the\nanisotropic metrics considered in [10], having the novelty of maintaining the SC\nevent horizon free of space-time singularities and maintain as the only spacetime singularity the SC mass pole at the origin such that the value of the SC\nmass pole is maintained [11, 1]. This metric is locally anisotropic consistently\nwith astrophysical observations [12, 13] converging at large radius to the RW\nmetric such that global isotropy is maintained. As this metric depends on a\nfunctional parameter \u03b1(r) dependent on the radial distance r to the central\nmass being considered, only the asymptotic limits for this parameter are fixed,\nspecifically at spatial infinity, at the SC radius (the event horizon) and at the\nlocation of massive point-like particles. In between the SC radius and spatial\ninfinity there are no theoretical restrictions on the metric parameter \u03b1.\nWe recall that the two asymptotic backgrounds for the ELA metric (the SC\nmetric and the RW metric) are well established results both phenomenologically\nand theoretically such that an interpolation between both these limiting solutions is physically required justifying the existence of gravitational corrections\nto SC backgrounds at intermediate spatial scales. In addition let us note that\nthe background mass-energy density as well as the corrections to the gravitational acceleration with respect to the respective quantities for SC backgrounds\ndepend on the metric functional parameter \u03b1 such that the value of this parameter allows to fine-tune the gravitational interactions corrections, namely the\npredictions for orbital motion and gravitational red-shifts. Therefore the motivation to investigate whether measured deviations from the predictions on SC\ngravitational backgrounds can be consistently described by an ELA background\nis two-fold:\n\u2022 it allows for the definition of the functional parameter \u03b1 for intermediate\nspatial scales maintaining compatibility with the asymptotic solutions,\nhence allowing to research the inclusion of the ELA metric within more\nfundamental frameworks;\n\u2022 it allows for a mathematical modelation of gravitational systems maintaining compatibility with the asymptotic well established solutions, hence\nsimultaneously increasing the accuracy of predictions and fixing a relation\nbetween the corrections to gravitational acceleration, red-shifts and the\nbackground mass-energy density through Einstein Equations.\nHence, generally, a fit of the gravitational parameter to experimental data allows\nboth for a modelation parameterization of gravitational corrections to SC backgrounds as well as to fix, within this framework, the background mass-energy\n2\n\n\fdensity such that this construction describes unaccounted background extended\nmatter densities as well as the respective gravitational corrections to physical\nobservables similarly to the heuristic dark matter distributions [14].\n\n1.2\n\nELA Metric\n\nSpecifically the line-element for the ELA metric is [1]\nds2\n\n=\n\n(1 \u2212 USC ) c2 dt2 \u2212 r2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0010\n\u00112\n\u03b1\n1\nr\n1\ndr \u2212 H (1 \u2212 USC ) 2 + 2 c dt\n\u2212\n.\n1 \u2212 USC\nc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H = \u0227/a is the time dependent Hubble rate defined as the rate of change\nof the universe scale factor a, USC = 2GM/(c2 r) is the usual Schwarzschild\ngravitational potential, G is the Gravitational constant, M is the value of the\nSchwarzschild mass pole for the central mass being considered and c is the speed\nof light in vacuum. Here the radial coordinate r cohincides with the physical\nmeasurable distances, hence corresponds to the proper spatial coordinate. The\nexponent \u03b1 is, generally, a function of the radial coordinate which must obey\nthe following asymptotic conditions [1]:\n1\n1. \u03b1(r \u223c 0) \u223c \u2212 , ensuring that the value of the SC mass pole is maintained;\nr\n2. \u03b1(r = rSC ) \u2265 3, ensuring that the SC event horizon is not an extended\nspace-time singularity;\n3. \u03b1(r \u223c +\u221e) \u223c 0, ensuring that the total background mass is finite and the\nRW background is asymptotically recovered;\nwhere rSC = 2GM/c2 is the SC radius. Following these conditions we consider\nthe simplified ansatz studied in [1, 15]\n\u03b1(r)\n\n\u1fb10\n\n= (\u1fb10 \u2212 \u03b11 ) + \u03b11 USC (r) = (\u1fb10 \u2212 \u03b11 ) + \u03b11\n=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 \u03b10.0 \u2265 3 , r \u223c rSC\n\uf8f3\n\n\u03b10\n\n2GM\n,\nc2 r\n(2)\n\n, r \u226b rSC\n\nwhere \u1fb10 and \u03b11 are numerical coefficients. The bound \u1fb10 \u2265 3 ensures that the\nSC radius is an event horizon and space-time is singularity free at this horizon,\nwhile for the bound \u1fb10 > 5 space-time is asymptotically Ricci flat near the event\nhorizon such that the SC metric is a good approximation in a neighbourhood\nof the point-like mass M . The coefficient \u03b11 < 0 ensures that the singularity\nat the origin coincides with the SC mass-pole. In the following analysis we will\nconsider it arbitrarily close to zero, \u22121 \u226a \u03b11 < 0, such that outside the event\nhorizon its effects are negligible, hence \u03b1 \u2248 \u03b10 for planetary orbits. For further\ndetails in the derivation of the ELA metric ansatz see [1].\nBased in this ansatz we will compute the analytical corrections to two body\nheliocentric orbital motion within the solar system on the ELA metric background (1) with respect to orbital motion on Schwarzschild backgrounds [17, 16].\n3\n\n\fMore accurate results including the many body gravitational interactions in the\nSolar System can only be computed by extensive numerical analysis including\nthe known bodies in the solar system [18, 19]. These analysis are usually carried\nin the PPN formalism which includes both the General Relativity corrections to\nthe classical Newton law of gravitation on Schwarzschild backgrounds, as well\nas corrections of extended theories of gravity such as Brans-Dicke gravity [20].\n\n1.3\n\nStandard of measurement in the Solar System\n\nIn addition to the IS unit (the meter), as standard of measurement within\nthe Solar System it is also commonly employed the Astronomical Unit (AU ).\nToday this quantity has a fixed value in IS units. However its original definition\nrelies on the classical Kepler's third law fixing a mathematical relation between\nthe measurement projection for spatial-lengths and the measurement projection\nfor temporal-lengths (through the gravitational constant G). Specifically the\noriginal definition of the AU was stated in IS units as [21, 23, 22, 4]\nAU =\n\nG M\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\nT1AU.0\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132 ! 13\n\n= 149597870700 m ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere M\u2299 = 1.9891 \u00d7 1030 kg is the Sun's mass, G = 6.67 \u00d7 10\u221211 kg \u22121 m3 s\u22122\nis the Gravitational constant and T1AU.0 = 31562889.928 . . . s is the Keplerian\norbital period for a point mass in an elliptic orbit with semi-major axis of\nvalue 1 AU . This original definition exactly matches Kepler's third law for a\nplanet orbiting the Sun in an elliptic orbit with semi-major axis of length rorb =\n1 AU being based on the existence of a classical Keplerian p\nconstant of motion,\nspecifically the angular momentum J0 (rorb = 1 AU ) = \u2212 G M AU (1 \u2212 e2 ),\nwhere e is the orbit eccentricity. Hence time and space measurements are related\nby this classical conservation law stated in the definition (3).\nAs many of simulations and analysis of dynamical motion within the Solar\nSystem, in particular of orbital motion, in the literature assumed this constraint (3), often the interpretation of experimental data would favour either a\ntime varying value for the AU or the gravitational constant G as the best fits. In\nparticular, in the original work by Krasinsky and Brumberg [23] (see also [22]),\nconsidering experimental data from range measurements of planetary orbital\nmotion plus range measurements from orbiters and landers it was concluded\nthat a yearly variation of the AU constitutes a best fit to the planetary and\nspacecraft ephemerides within the Solar System. It is today accepted that such\nvariation has no physical meaning and that any standard of measurement should\nbe maintained fixed [4, 19]. Nevertheless these analysis imply that some sort\nof unmodeled gravitational interaction deviation with respect to Schwarzschild\nbackgrounds predictions is present in the Solar System.\nWe also note that formally, any corrections to Kepler's third law (3), can be\nmathematical rewritten as a time varying AU or G such that maintaining the\nclassical constraint (3) for a fixed value of the AU accounts for a time varying\nG. Following these observations the planetary ephemerides were recently reanalyzed by Pitjeva and Pitjev [4] maintaining the AU fixed and accounting for\nthe experimental bounds on the Sun's mass variation \u1e40\u2299 6= 0 showing that,\nfurther including a time varying Gravitational constant \u0120 6= 0, allows for a\nbetter fit than previous analysis. Specifically the estimate considered for the\n4\n\n\fSun's mass variation due to radiation and matter emission and absorption is\n(see [4, 24] and references therein)\n\u1e40\u2299\n\u221214\n= \u22126.7+3.1\n(yr\u22121 ) ,\n\u22123.1 \u00d7 10\nM\u2299\n\n(4)\n\nand the unmodeled fitted value of the variation of the Gravitational constant\nis [4]\n\u0120\n\u221214\n= +1.65+5.85\n(yr\u22121 ) .\n(5)\n\u22125.85 \u00d7 10\nG\nIn the remaining of this work we exploit the mathematical constraint between\nthe Gravitational constant and the orbital period implemented by Kepler's third\nlaw, hence the original definition of the AU (3), showing that the perturbative\ncorrections to the classical Keplerian period due to the background described\nby the ELA metric (1) can describe this unmodeled variation of G. Generally\nsuch map is formally expressed by considering the corrections to the several\nquantities over a given period of time, for instance an orbital period for a orbit\nwith semimajor axis of value 1 AU . For the specific case of the AU definition (3),\nmaintaining a fixed value for this standard of measurement, we obtain\n\u0120\nG\n\n\u2261\n\n1 \u2206G1AU.0\nT1AU.0\nG\n\n= \u2212\n\n1\nT1AU.0\n\n\u2206M\u2299.1AU.0\nAU 3\n+2\nM\u2299\nGM\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\n2\u03c0\nT1AU.0\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2206T1AU.0\nT1AU.0\n\n!\n\n(6)\n,\n\nwhere \u2206G1AU.0 is the unmodeled variation of the Gravitational constant G over\none orbital period, \u2206M\u2299.1AU.0 is the variation of Sun's mass due to emission\nand absorption of matter and radiation over one orbital period and \u2206T1AU.0\nis the modeled variation (over one orbital period) of the orbital period with\nrespect to the classical Keplerian orbital period T1AU.0 . We remark that for\na given planetary orbit, also the semimajor axis will generally be varying over\ntime.\nWe also note that the estimates of [18, 4] are computed for heliocentric\ndistances and the estimates of [19] are computed for barycentric distances such\nthat some discrepancies, mainly on estimates for orbital radii and time variation\nof the orbital radii are verified between both approaches as the distance between\nthe centre of the Sun and the solar System barycentre is of order \u223c 108 m. For\ntechnical simplification and aiming at a direct comparison with the estimates\nin [18, 4], we will carry our calculations in heliocentric distances. We stress that\nfor a numerical simulation on an expanding background with a fix value of the\nAU and without considering the classical constraint corresponding to the Kepler\nthird law (3) the gravitational constant should be considered fixed such that the\ndeviation of orbital motion from the predictions of Schwarzschild backgrounds\nis fully described by the corrections to gravitational interactions which depend\non the functional parameter \u03b1(r) (1).\n\n5\n\n\f1.4\n\nOutline\n\nWhen required, for numerical evaluation of the Hubble rate H and the deceleration factor q of today's universe, we are considering the values [13]\nH0\nq0\n\n=\n\nH|t=t0 = 2.28 \u00d7 10\u221218 s\u22121 ,\n\n=\n\n\u00e4\n\u2212\na\n\n\u0012 \u0013\u22122\n\u0227\na\n\n(7)\nt=t0\n\n= \u22120.582 .\n\nAs for the planetary orbital parameters considered for numerical evaluations we\nare considering the data presented in table 1.\nPlanet\nMercury\nVenus\nEarth\nMars\nJupiter\nSaturn\nUranus\nNeptune\nPluto\n\nrorb\n(\u00d71011 m)\n\ne\n\nm\n(\u00d71024 kg)\n\n\u03b4orb\n(deg)\n\n\u03b4per\n(deg)\n\nf\n(deg)\n\n0.579091768\n1.08208926\n1.49597887\n2.27936637\n7.78412027\n14.26725413\n28.70972220\n44.98252911\n59.06376272\n\n0.20563069\n0.00677323\n0.01671022\n0.09341233\n0.04839266\n0.05415060\n0.04716771\n0.00858587\n0.24880766\n\n0.3302\n4.8685\n5.9736\n0.64185\n1898.6\n568.46\n86.832\n102.43\n0.0125\n\n7.00487\n3.39471\n0\n1.85061\n1.30530\n2.48446\n0.76986\n1.76917\n17.14175\n\n77.45645\n131.53298\n102.94719\n336.04084\n14.75385\n92.43194\n170.96424\n44.97135\n224.06676\n\n174.796\n50.4468\n357.517\n19.3564\n18.8180\n320.347\n142.956\n267.767\n14.8601\n\nTable 1: Planetary orbits parameters: the semi-major axis rorb , the eccentricity\ne, the mass m, the orbital inclination \u03b4orb , the longitude of perihelion \u03b4per and\nthe true anomaly f [25].\nThis work is organized as follows. In section 2 are computed the analytical solutions for orbital motion on the background describe by the ELA metric\nbeing derived the General Relativity corrections to orbital perihelion advance\nand orbital period for such backgrounds. This derivation is carried considering\na static elliptical orbit approximation. In section 3 are analyzed circular orbits\non the ELA metric background (1) and computed the orbital radius variation\nwithin this approximation. In section 4 are analyzed the corrections to Kepler's\nthird law due to the decrease of the Sun's mass and due to the background\ndescribed by the ELA metric. In particular are derived estimates for the several contributions that allow to match the heuristic fit to the variation of the\nGravitational constant [4] and it is computed the value of the ELA metric parameter \u03b10 that maps such fit to the gravitational corrections obtained for the\nbackground described by the ELA metric. Are also computed the respective\ncorrections to orbital perihelion advance and orbital radius variation. In the\nconclusions we shortly resume and discuss the results obtained in this work.\n\n2\n\nPerturbative Static Elliptical Orbit Solutions\n\nIn this section we derive analytical solutions for elliptical orbits on the background described by the ELA metric ansatz (1). In particular we will explicitly\n6\n\n\fcompute the General Relativity corrections on such backgrounds to the Keplerian elliptical orbit solution r(\u03c6) = 1/u0 (\u03c6) with\nu0 (\u03c6) =\n\n1 + e cos(\u03c6)\n, d = rorb (1 \u2212 e2 ) ,\nd\n\n(8)\n\nwhere e is the orbit eccentricity and rorb is the elliptic orbit semi-major axis.\nWe note that such corrections will generally include the General Relativity corrections on Schwarzschild backgrounds as well as corrections depending on the\nHubble rate H.\nIt is hard, if not impossible, to obtain an exact analytical solution considering\nthe differential equations for a time varying Hubble rate H. The main difficulty\nis that energy conservation is no-longer given by a constant of motion, instead\nwe have a non-linear second order differential equation on the function t coupled\nto the differential equation for r. Hence, for technical simplification purposes,\nwe are taking the static orbit approximation by considering a fixed Hubble rate\nH = H0 corresponding to today's measured value for this rate.\nFrom the metric line-element (1) let us consider the Lagrangian definition [17, 16] to order H02\n\u0013\u0012\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u0010\ndt\nr \u00112\nL\nc\n(1 \u2212 USC )\u03b1\n=\n1 \u2212 USC \u2212 H0\nm\nc\nd\u03c4\n\u03b10\n1\nr\ndt dr\n\u22121\n(1 \u2212 USC ) 2 2 c\n\u2212\nc\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4\n1 \u2212 USC\n\u0001\n+O H02 t .\n\n+2H0\n\n\u0012\n\ndr\nd\u03c4\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2212 r2\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c4\n\n\u00132\n\n(9)\nThis Lagrangian is a constant L/m = c and it is considered that the orbit of\nthe test body is lying in the plane of constant coordinate \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 such that\nd\u03b8 = 0 and sin \u03b8 = 1 [17, 16].

Explicitly it is the term \u22122q0 H02 t r (1 \u2212\nUSC )(\u03b10 \u22121)/2 (dt/d\u03c4 ) (dr/d\u03c4 ). Comparing the terms of order H02 in the Lagrangian with this term we conclude that this is a valid approximation as long\nas the value of the time coordinate is below the following bound\nt\u226a\u2212\n\n\u03b10\n1\n1 EH\nr\n\u223c 1013 years.\n(1 \u2212 USC ) 2 \u2212 2\nq0 dr/d\u03c4\nmc2\n\n(13)\n\nThis bound is well above any astrophysical measurement time span and has been\nobtained by considering the following simplified assumptions, within the solar\nsystem, from the experimental upper bounds on the orbital radius variations\nwithin the Solar System [24] we consider the estimate for the ratio |r/\u1e591 | >\n1020 , assume weak gravitational field USC \u226a 1 and values of \u03b10 for which the\napproximation (1 \u2212 USC )(\u03b10 \u22121)/2 \u223c 1 is valid. We note that this approximation\nwill no longer be valid for very large values of the metric exponent, |\u03b10 | \u226b 0.\nNoting that for orbits in the solar system the function u has relatively small\nvalues (0.5 \u00d7 10\u221212 < u < 0.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 m\u22121 , where rorb is the orbit semi-major\naxis), with the objective of further simplifying the differential equation (12), we\nconsider a series expansion on u of the terms of order H02 which is equivalent to\nan expansion on the weak gravitational field.

Hence, although\nfor positive values of \u03b10 the approximation (15) subject to the bound (17) allows to establish a fairly good estimate for the maximum contribution of the\ncorrections on the ELA metric background, for negative values of \u03b10 no bounds\ncan be set for such contribution.

The analytical solutions computed so far do not allow to estimate\nsuch variation for the orbital radius as we have approximated the ELA metric\nbackground by a static background with fixed Hubble rate H0 = H(t0 ) (9).\nIn the next section, from conservation of angular momentum, we estimate the\norbital radius variation by considering approximately circular orbits.\n\n3\n\nCircular Orbits Approximation: Time Varying Orbital Radius\n\nIn this section, with the objective of estimating the orbital radius variation on\nbackgrounds described by the ELA metric, we are analyzing circular orbits on\nsuch backgrounds.

Consistently at very large\nradius (r \u223c lH = c/H) the gravitational potential is negligible (1/r \u223c 0) such\nthat pure cosmological expansion is asymptotically recovered and no stable orbits exist (\u1e591 /r \u223c 2q02 H 3 r3 > 0).\nAs for the specific dependence of the orbital radius variation on the parameter \u03b10 it is positive for small values of \u03b10 \u223c 0 being of the same order\nof magnitude of the pure expansion effects, for growing positive values of this\nparameter, the radius variation decreases having a negative minimum value and\nthen asymptotically vanishing in the limit \u03b10 \u2192 +\u221e . This is actually expected,\nwe note that in this limit the shift function is null, lim\u03b10 \u2192+\u221e (1\u2212USC ) = 0, such\nthat we exactly recover the SC metric, hence a Ricci flat space-time for which\n\u1e591 /r is exactly null for all orbits. As for growing negative values of this parameter the radius variation increases up to a maximum positive value and then\ndecreases monotonically. For large negative values of this parameter \u03b10 \u226a 0\nthe corrections with respect to Schwarzschild backgrounds become significantly\nhigher with \u1e591 /r < 0 being unbounded from below.

We recall that the original Solar System modeling is carried assuming the definition of the AU (3) which is based on\nthe classical Kepler's third law and, as discussed in the introduction, when this\nlaw is not considered to be a constraint (3), both the values for the AU and G\ncan be maintained fixed such that the measured deviations from the predictions\nof orbital motion on Schwarzschild backgrounds are accounted for by the ELA\nmetric background. Aiming at mapping these effects to the heuristic fit of the\nvariation of the Gravitational constant \u0120/G (5) to planetary ephemerides obtained in [4] we will discuss both the range measurement and the orbital motion\npredicted corrections on the backgrounds described by the ELA metric with\nrespect to Schwarzschild backgrounds.\nSpecifically, for each planetary orbit, the effects that contribute to the heuristic variation of the Gravitational constant when considering Kepler's third law\nas a constraint (3) are, the decrease of the Sun's mass, the orbital period corrections and the orbital radius variation. Hence, for a planetary orbit of average\nheliocentric semi-major radius rorb we obtain respectively the three distinct\ncontributions\n\u0120\n\u0120\n\u0120\n\u0120\n=\n+\n,\n(35)\n+\nG\nG\nG\nG\norb\n\norb.\u1e40\u2299\n\norb.\u2206T\n\norb.\u1e59\n\nwhere the several contributions are\n\u0120\nG\n\u0120\nG\n\u0120\nG\n\n=\norb.\u1e40\u2299\n\n=\norb.\u2206T\n\n=\norb.\u1e59\n\n\u1e40\u2299\n(yr\u22121 ) ,\nM\u2299\n\u0012 \u00132\n3\n\u2206TH 2 Tyr\nrorb\n2\u03c0\n\u22122\n(yr\u22121 ) ,\nGM\u2299 T\nT\nT\n\u0012 \u00132\n3\nrorb\n\u1e59orb Tyr\n2\u03c0\n+3\n(yr\u22121 ) .\nGM\u2299 T\nrorb T\n\n\u2212\n\n(36)\n\nIn these expressions all quantities are expressed in IS units and the reference\nyear is considered to be the Julian year define in IS seconds as\nTyr = 31557600 s .\n\n(37)\n\nThe contribution due to the variation of the Sun's mass is constant (4) while\nboth the corrections to the orbital period and the time variation of the orbital\nradius depend on the value of the metric parameter \u03b10 . To obtain a precise\nestimate for the values of these contributions it would be required a numerical analysis of the Solar System dynamics. To further proceed analytically let\nus consider the approximate analytical estimates discussed in the previous sections such that the expression for \u2206TH 2 is given in (29) and the expression for\n\u1e59orb /rorb is given in (34) corresponding to the corrections to the orbital period\nand orbital radius variation due to the expanding background described by the\n17\n\n\fG\u0090Gorb H \u030110-12 yr-1 L\n\nG\u0090Gorb H \u030110-12 yr-1 L\n\n6\n\nHaL Mercury's Orbit contribution to G\u0090G\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n\nHbL Venus's Orbit contribution to G\u0090G\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03910\n2\n\nHcL Earth's Orbit contribution to G\u0090G\nG\u0090Gorb H \u030110-12 yr-1 L\n\nG\u0090Gorb H \u030110-12 yr-1 L\n\n4\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03910\n\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n\nHdL Mars's Orbit contribution to G\u0090G\n\n1\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-4\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n\u03910\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03910\n\nFigure 3: Variation of the Gravitational constant \u0120/G\n(35) as a function\norb\nof the constant metric parameter \u03b10 when Kepler's third law is considered as a\nconstraint, for: (a) the orbit of Mercury; (b) the orbit of Venus; (c) the orbit\nof Earth; (d) the orbit of Mars.\nELA metric with respect to the respective quantities computed on Schwarzschild\nbackgrounds. These estimates are a fairly good approximation except for the\norbital radius variation for the planet Mercury and the planet Pluto due to the\nrelatively high eccentricity of their orbits. Nevertheless, as we are going to show\nnext, the main contributions that are mapped to the variation of the Gravitational constant are due to the decrease of the Sun's mass (4) and to the General\nRelativity corrections to the orbital period on backgrounds described by the\nELA metric such that the contribution due to the orbital radius variation is\nnegligible being lower than the remaining contributions by a factor of 10\u221227 at\nMercury's orbit and by a factor of 10\u221224 at Pluto's orbit, hence being negligible\nfor the estimate obtained. For completeness of the analytical expressions we are\nkeeping this contribution in the following derivations.\nFor each planetary orbit these contributions have an inflection point near\n\u03b10 = 1 such that for \u03b10 \u226b 0 it is verified a significant increase of the variation\nof the Gravitational constant while for \u03b10 \u226a 0 it is verified a significant decrease\nof the variation of the Gravitational constant. As an example, the dependence\nof the variation \u0120/G\non the values of the parameter \u03b10 for the inner planets\norb\nof the Solar System, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars is plotted in figure 3.\nAs for the corrections to Kepler's third law as perceived for Earth based\nrange measurements are computed by evaluating the difference between the\ncorrections corresponding to the geodesic motion of Earth and the corrections\ncorresponding to the geodesic motion of the planet for which the range measurement is being considered. Hence, for range measurements between Earth\nand any other planet in the Solar System, these corrections are mapped to a\n\n18\n\n\fvariation of the gravitational constant as\n\u0120\nG\nwhere \u0120/G\n\norb.Earth\n\n\u0120\nG\n\n=\nrange\n\nand \u0120/G\n\norb.Earth\n\norb.planet\n\n\u0120\nG\n\n\u2212\n\n,\n\n(38)\n\norb.planet\n\ncorrespond to \u0120/G\n\norb\n\n(35) evaluated\n\nfor the orbit of Earth and the orbit of each planet, respectively.\nFurther noting that, when performing numerical analysis and numerical integration of the Solar System dynamics, the fitted variation of the Gravitational\nconstant is approximately a linear effect [4] being independent of each planet's\nmass, a estimate for the average value of \u0120/G\n(35) can be obtained by a\norb\nsimple average of the contributions due to each planetary orbit\n\n*\n\n\u0120\nG\n\n+\n\n=\n\n9\nX\n\u0120\nG\ni=1\n\norb.i\n\n9\n\norbit\n\n.\n\n(39)\n\nAs for the average value for the contribution of \u0120/G\n\nrange\n\nto the experimental\n\ndata measurement can be estimated by an average weighted by the number of\nevents Ni divided by the respective rms residuals \u03c3i\n\n*\n\n\u0120\nG\n\n+\n\n=\n\n9\nX\n\n\u0120\nG\n\ni=1,i6=3\n\nrange\n\n9\nX\n\nrange.i\n\ni=1,i6=3\n\nNi\n\u03c3i\n.\n\n(40)\n\nNi\n\u03c3i\n\nIn these expressions the index i runs from 1 to 9 referring to the planets in the\nSolar System listed in table 1 and \u0120/G\nand \u0120/G\nare the variations of\norb.i\n\nrange.i\n\nthe Gravitational constant evaluated for each planetary orbit in the Solar System\nfor heliocentric orbital motion (35) and Earth based range measurements (38),\nrespectively. The values of the weights wi = Ni /\u03c3i are computed from table 2\nand table 3 of [4] being \u03c91 = 4.65, \u03c92 = 35692.38, \u03c93 = 0, \u03c94 = 469279.08,\n\u03c95 = 74.86, \u03c96 = 348.02, \u03c97 = 62.40, \u03c98 = 64.66 and \u03c99 = 38.79.\nHence, when considering the ELA metric background, there will be two distinct corrections which can be mapped into the heuristic fit to the variation of\nthe Gravitational constant \u0120/G. Let us recall that the numerical analysis of the\nSolar System dynamics has, generally, two distinct procedures [18, 19]. First the\nephemerides are built considering as the base model only the well established\nGeneral Relativity gravitation interactions on Schwarzschild backgrounds. Then\nthe ephemerides are numerically integrated by considering a wide number of\nparameters which generally may include corrections to the gravitational interactions on Schwarzschild backgrounds, for example the PPN parameters \u03b3, \u03b2\nand \u03b1, as well as the variation of the Gravitational constant, corresponding to\nthe parameter \u0120/G. It is D\nfrom this\nE second numerical analysis that an unmodeled fit to the parameter\n\n\u0120/G\n\nfit\n\nis obtained (5). Therefore when mapping\n19\n\n\fthe ELA metric background gravitational interactions corrections to deviations\nfrom the gravitational interactions on Schwarzschild backgrounds it is required\nto consider corrections to both of these procedures. In particular when mapping the modeled correction to an heuristic variation of the Gravitational constant we obtainD that\nE the average value with respect to the ephemerides data is\nhGieph = G0 + \u0120\nand, when fitting the ephemerides data to a heliocentric\nrange\nD E\nD E\nmodel of the Solar System, we obtain hGieph = G0 + \u0120\n\u2212 \u0120\n, where the\nfit\norb\nD E\ncontribution \u0120\ncorresponds to the heuristic fit (5). Hence matching these\nfit\ntwo expressions we obtain the following map between the fit to the parameter\n\u0120/G (5) and the modeled average contributions (39) and (40)\n* +\n* +\n* +\n\u0120\n\u0120\n\u0120\n=\n+\n.\n(41)\nG\nG\nG\nfit\n\norb\n\nrange\n\nGenerally we could consider a variation of the functional parameter \u03b1 across\nthe Solar System such that, for each planetary orbit, this metric parameter\nwould be given by an approximately constant value \u03b10.i . However a more accurate fit to ephemerides requires a full numerical analysis including the gravitational corrections due to the ELA metric background. For analytical analysis\npurposes, let us simply consider an approximately constant coefficient \u03b10 across\nthe Solar System. Hence, from the map (41) and for the value of the fit (5) we\nobtain\n* +\n\u0120\n= 1.65 \u00b1 5.85 \u00d7 10\u221214 (yr\u22121 ) \u21d4 \u03b10 |H 2 = 1.06+0.96\n(42)\n\u22121.14 .\nG\nfit\n\nWe note that the dependence of the variation of the Gravitational constant\non \u03b10 has an inflexion point near \u03b10 = 1 (see figure 3), the relatively large\nuncertainty on the value of \u03b10 is mainly due to the proximity to this inflexion\npoint. In table 3 are listed the values of the contributions from each planetary\norbit in the Solar System to the estimate (42). The correction to the orbital\nperiod per each Julian year in the range of the parameter \u03b10 given in (42) is\napproximately the same for all planetary orbits\n\u2206TH 2\n\nTyr\n= \u22120.065 \u00b1 1.16 \u00d7 10\u22126 s yr\u22121 ,\nT\n\n(43)\n\nwhere \u2206TH 2 corresponds to the period correction per revolution for each planet (29).\nAlthough this correction is enough to map the heuristic fit to the variation of\nthe AU , we note that it is negligible for most of other purposes, even for archaeological fits to the variation of the Solar System parameters we obtain at\nmost a variation of the Earth year by \u00b11.7 h over a period of 109 years, hence\nwithin the uncertainty of such estimate [24].\nAs for the values for the corrections to the orbital perihelion advance and\norbital radii variation for each planet are listed in table 4. These corrections\nare lower by more than 8 orders of magnitude when compared to the respective\npredictions for Schwarzschild backgrounds.

The estimate uncertainty for\neach of these values is more than 8 orders of magnitude below the quoted values.\ntions of motion employed for the dynamical analysis of the Solar System do\nnot include the effects due to the Sun's mass variation, hence these corrections must also be taken in consideration when mapping the fitted value of the\nGravitational constant to the gravitational corrections due to the background\ndescribed by the ELA metric.

Including the corrections (44)\non the previous analisys we obtain the final estimate for the metric parameter\n\u03b10\n* +\n\u0120\n= 1.65 \u00b1 5.85 \u00d7 10\u221214 (yr\u22121 ) \u21d4 \u03b10 = 0.98+1.06\n(46)\n\u22121.01 .\nG\nfit\n\nHence it is not excluded the interpretation that our result simply corresponds to\na statistical flutuation of the experimental measurements. Also we remark that\nthe analysis carried here was computed by considering the average effect of two\nbody interactions, specifically the Sun and each of the planets. A full numerical\nanalysis of orbital ephemerides is required to properly include the many body\n22\n\n\finteractions in the Solar System and eventualy obtain a more accurate estimate\nfor the metric parameter.\nWith respect to the ELA metric background we note that the value of the\nmetric parameter \u03b10 parameterizes the local anisotropic corrections with respect to the isotropic cosmological background, specifically space-time is locally\nisotropic for \u03b10 = 0 which corresponds to the isotropic background described by\nthe McVittie metric [9]. The value of \u03b10 \u2248 1.06 (42) corresponds to a relatively\nsmall perturbation to the isotropic background which, as has been shown, corresponds to relatively small corrections to the orbital parameters. Consistently\nwith this discussion we remark that, when compared with a isotropic variation\nof the Gravitational constant \u0120/G, the corrections due to the ELA metric background to the orbital period are relatively more relevant than the corrections\nto the orbital perihelion advance and orbital radius variation. It is due to the\nbackground anisotropy between the radial direction and angular directions that\nsuch effect is attainable. In addition we recall that, when considering point-like\nmassive objects, as we approach the SC horizon the metric exponent \u03b1 should\nbe greater or equal to \u03b1(rSC ) = 3 to ensure that space-time is singularity free at\nthis horizon. This requirement is not absolutely necessary as the real Sun is not\na point-like mass being instead an extended spheroid, hence without an event\nhorizon. Nevertheless we further note that the uncertainty on the estimate of\nthe constant \u03b10 is relatively large and we may expect that a functional parameter \u03b1 varying across the Solar System would allow for a better fit to planetary\nephemerides, hence we may conjecture that its value should be decreasing with\ngrowing heliocentric distances being close to \u03b1 = 3 near the Sun. This discussion is not conclusive being required a numerical analysis of the Solar System\ndynamics including the corrections due to the ELA metric background to actually verify if such a profile for the values of \u03b1 is the best fit to planetary motion\nin the Solar System.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we have mapped the corrections to Kepler's third law on backgrounds described by the ELA metric (1) to the heuristic variation of the Gravitational constant \u0120/G estimated from numerical analysis of the Solar System\ndynamics on Schwarzschild backgrounds. These corrections plus the decrease of\nthe Sun's mass by radiation emissions fully account for the fitted value of the\nvariation of the Gravitational constant (5). Reflecting the anisotropic nature of\nthe ELA metric background, the more relevant contribution to such modeling\nis due to the orbital period corrections, being the contributions to the orbital\nradii variation negligible.\nThe constant value for the metric parameter that matches the quoted variation of the Gravitational constant is \u03b10 = 0.98+1.06\n\u22121.00 (46), hence relatively close\nto the value \u03b10 = 0 which corresponds to the isotropic background described\nby the McVittie metric. For completeness let us further note that other effects\nwhich may be relevant on backgrounds described by the ELA metric such as\nthe corrections to the Doppler shift for range measurements, are negligible for\nthis value of the metric parameter, being of the same order of magnitude of the\neffects attributed to the isotropic cosmological expansion [30, 15]. Following the\nsame arguments we further conclude that, within the Solar System the contri-\n\n23\n\n\fbution to the cosmological mass-energy density within the Solar System due to\nthe ELA metric background is negligible [31] (for further details see [15]).\nHence we have shown that the heuristic variation of the Gravitational constant \u0120/G [23, 4] can alternatively be mapped and modeled by the ELA metric\nbackground parameterizing the corrections to gravitational interactions within\nthe Solar System without considering Kepler's third law as a constraint through\nthe definition of the AU (3). Such construction allows for a fixed constant value\nboth for the AU and the Gravitational constant G independently of the original\ndefinition of the AU as has recently been suggested [4, 19]. For analytical analysis purposes we have considered a constant metric parameter \u03b10 for which we\nobtain a relatively high uncertainty. More generally a radially symmetric functional parameter with varying value across the Solar System would allow for a\nsignificant reduction of such uncertainty as well as allowing to match the distinct\nunmodeled estimates for \u0120 for the several planets in the Solar System [24, 32].\nThe results obtained here are enough to motivate a numerical analysis of the\nSolar System dynamics including the ELA metric background corrections to\ngravitational interactions. This framework solves the problem of the unwelcome\nvariation of the measurement projection standard (whether the AU , whether\nthe Gravitational constant G) and constitutes as well a playground for testing\nthe ELA metric background in the most well known of all the astrophysical\nsystems, the Solar System. We leave such study to another work.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by grant SFRH/BPD/34566/2007 from FCT-MCTES.\nWork developed in the scope of the strategical project of GFM-UL PEst-OE/MAT/UI0208/2011.\n\nReferences\n[1] P.
