The large conductivity change ratio, combined with an accessible transition temperature and rich\ncorrelated-electron physics2\u20134 has made this an attractive compound for many researchers. Much attention has\nhistorically revolved around controversy over the driving\nphysics of the phase transition; particularly whether it\nis a Mott transition5\u20137 or Pierels transition2,8,9 . However, also of interest is the ability of the IMT to happen\non ultrafast (100fs) timescales10 , and the wide range of\nstimuli which can trigger it11,12 . Along these lines, recent interest has also shifted from purely academic to industrial as well; following proposed applications ranging\nfrom optical devices13 and hybrid-metamaterials14\u201316 to\nelectronic components17,18 and data storage19,20 . With\nthis rise of potential applications comes opportunities for\nnew avenues of research and development, but also new\nchallenges to satisfy the durability and flexibility that\nreal-world devices demand21 . Understanding the role of\ntemperature and structural transitions in various VO2\nphenomenon is key to pushing towards potential of applications.\nIn this manuscript we take an interest in the recently\nreported22,23 phenomenon of self-sustaining oscillations\n\na) Tom.Driscoll@Duke.edu\n\nin VO2 bridges. The widespread prevalence of voltage controlled oscillators in electronics makes this phenomenon an enticing candidate for devices. It is fairly\nwell accepted that these oscillations represent a triggering of the Insulator-to-Metal Transition (IMT), followed\nby a reseting Metal-to-Insulator Transition (MIT). However, despite headway on controlling such oscillations in\nVO2 23,24 , there is still debate over whether the underlying driving mechanism is thermal or electrostatic. In\nliterature, VO2 is most often thermally triggered, and\nyet these oscillations appear to respond to foremost to\napplied voltage across the device. The unavoidable presence of joule-heating currents through the 2-terminal device during operation, coupled with the observed sensitivity of the oscillations to device temperature21,25 , make\nfor a contentious situation.\nIn our investigation we first experimentally reproduce\nthe oscillations discovered by the authors of Ref22 . The\nuse of a high-performance oscilloscope in our experiment gives us access to very fine time-resolution data\nwhich is useful in our modeling. The details and data\nof our experiment are reported in Section II. Following this, we develop a model which replicates and explains the observed waveshape in terms of electricallytriggered domains. Our model, reported in Section III,\ndescribes a network of electrically and/or thermally triggered grains. This model is inspired by several previously proposed models26,27 . While these previous models also predict avalanche-like transitions under the right\nconditions26 , our our model expands on this framework\nto track time-dependent effects and allow possibility of\na voltage-triggered phase-transition. Alongside voltage\ntriggering, we investigate the role of temperature in the\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1. Schematic of the circuit diagram used to reproduce\noscillations, depicting the VO2 device as a variable resistance\nand capacitance. Inset shows optical photograph of a sample\ndevice. The Al2 O3 substrate is 330\u03bcm thick, and is mounted\non a glass cover slip. All experiments are performed at room\ntemperature.\n\noscillations, and importantly, we find while a voltagedriven picture replicates experimental data - thermal\nheating alone is quantitatively and qualitatively unable\nto explain the structure of the observed oscillations. Nevertheless, device temperature does affect oscillations, and\nthermal co-factors to the voltage triggering are needed\nto reproduce aspects of the data. In Section IV we discuss how the percolative transition of VO2 affects the\nshape of the MIT, and what this means regarding effective medium within the phase-coexistence region. In\nSection V we conclude the manuscript with an overview\nof our results, and an outlook on possible directions for\nVO2 research and application.\nII.\n\nVOLTAGE CONTROLLED OSCILLATIONS.\n\nOur investigation begins with replicating VO2 oscillations using the procedure reported by Kim et.al22,24 . A\ndevice consisting of a 10\u03bcm x 10\u03bcm VO2 bridge between\ntwo large (~400\u03bcm) metal (Ni:Au) electrodes (Figure 1inset ) is hooked in series with a limiting resistor (Rext )\nand voltage source (Vapp ). This setup is shown schematically in Figure 1. Although we do not intentionally add\nexternal capacitance, the presence of such Cext in instruments and cables is unavoidable - and should be included\nin the effective circuit. The applied voltage Vapp is a\ntransient square pulse (between 1\u03bcs to 1ms) from a Agilent function generator (model 33120A) riding on top of\na constant bias voltage (Vbias = 12V ). This is shown as\nthe black trace in Figure 2, giving a peak applied voltage\nof 22V. The voltage across the device (VD , as shown by\nthe blue trace in Figure 2) is monitored with a LeCroy\n(model wavepro 7-zi) oscilloscope, which allows for high\ntime-resolution (40GS/s) sampling resolution even over\nmillisecond-long pulses.\nIn this configuration, the VO2 device functions essentially as a capacitor with a variable internal shunt\n\nFIG. 2. Applied voltage and voltage across the device as a\nfunction of time.\n\nresistance RD . The capacitance CD is primarily fixed\nby device geometry, although variations of the dielectric constant of VO2 throughout the phase transition\n(such as have been shown in the context of memorycapacitance15,28 and VO2 hybrid-metamaterials14 ) may\nhave small effects - and we discuss this later in Section IV B. The pre-pulse steady-state starting voltage is\nVD =Vbias RD /(RD + Rext ). At the start of the pulse\n(t=0), VD increases, following a canonical ResistanceCapacitance (RC) charging curve. Once VD surpasses a\nthreshold voltage (which we will call VD:IM T ), it transitions sharply from increasing VD to decreasing. We\nassign this change to an IMT event occurring in the\nVO2 , which effectively lowers the internal shunt resistance RD of the capacitor. With lower internal resistance, the capacitor undergoes rapid discharge and VD\nplummets. This discharge continues until VD reaches a\nlower threshold voltage (VD:M IT at which a second event\n- which we similarly assign to a a Metal-to-InsulatorTransition (MIT) - restores the high internal device resistance. The process reverses and this sequence of events\nrepeats; alternating charging and discharging between\nIMT and MIT events with a fairly stable periodicity24 .\n\nIII.\n\nGRAIN-SCALE MODEL OF OSCILLATIONS.\n\nOur hope is that by developing a model for these observed oscillations, we may gain insight into the driving\nmechanism behind them. We start with a 2D network\nof square VO2 grains of differing size, each with total\nresistivity dependent on its size and its state (metal or\ninsulator)29,30 . The granularity of polycrystaline VO2\nis well documented31,32 , although the size of grains may\nvary considerably from one VO2 preparation to another.\nThere is also evidence to suggest the percolation length\nscales for the IMT may not always coincide with the crystal granularity33\u201335 . A cartoon illustrating our model ar-\n\n\f3\nof the device capacitance which involves the VO2 dielectric), which is found via finite element simulation using\nthe COMSOL commercial code package. C0 is a geometrical capacitance which is determined empirically, fitting\n1/RC to the capacitive charging curve. External circuit\nparameters such as Rext and Vapp are taken directly from\nexperimental values. The extrema values for RD (metal)\nand RD (insulator) are taken from temperature data.\n\nA.\n\nFIG. 3. Cartoon of the grains resistor-network. Left and\nright sides are the beginning of the nickel electrodes. In the\ncartoon, the size of squares represent a distribution of grain\nsizes and resistor colors serve to highlight the corresponding\ndifferent resistance.\n\nThermal triggering\n\nThe temperature driven IMT-MIT has been investigated in great detail and we ground our model using\nexperimental data giving resistance as a function of temperature R(T) through the phase transition. This data is\nshown in Figure 4a, and displays the characteristic sharp\nchange in resistivity around 345K.\nThen, in a procedure similar to previous works6,26 , we\nassume each grain will undergo an IMT in response a\n\"high-threshold\" temperature Tij\nIM T , and a MIT at a\nij\nlow-threshold TM IT .\nij\nif (T ij > TIM\nT)\n\nRij = Rmet\nrangement is shown in Figure 3. The network consists of\nNi xNj grains, and in our model we restrict our investigation to a 50x50 network array to keep computation time\nmanageable.\nThis grain network is placed in an external circuit containing resistance Rext and capacitance Cext , and driven\nby Vapp , as shown in Figure 1.

This includes solving a Kirchoff network problem36 for the voltage across each grain and the\nThevenin effective circuit resistance RD .

From this, we find a variance\nof T0 = 340o K and \u03c3T2 =.1*T0 reproduces the shape of\nthe IMT fairly well. This fit gives us confidence that we\nunderstand the thermal response of VO2 , even though\nour thermal model is simple compared to some previous\ntreatments.\nUsing this temperature-only-triggered model, we attempt to reproduce the oscillations shown in Figure 2.\nOur model tracks the power dissipated in each grain and\nemploys a finite-element method to solve for the grain\nand substrate temperatures as a function of time. Material thermal parameters are taken from literature, and\nthe enthalpy of phase-transition for VO2 is included. Figure 4b re-plots our experimental VD oscillations in blue,\nand the model results in green. The result is striking: although we can track VD for a short while, we are unable\nto produce any oscillatory phenomena.\nGeneralizing the behavior that prohibits oscillations,\nthermal-initiated IMTs exhibit a runaway behavior\nrather than the self-stabilizing oscillatory nature seen in\nFigure 2. This is apparent in the average VO2 grain\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4. a) Experimental resistance of our device as a function\nof temperature RD (T) (black).

We also plot\nthe average VO2 temperature TD from our model, illustrating\na runaway heating behavior that precludes oscillations.\n\ntemperature plot (red) of 4b. Note that although individual different grains may attain different temperatures\nover the course of oscillations, such gradients equalize\nquickly within the network. Average temperature remains a fairly accurate and easily visualized metric of\nthe VO2 oscillation thermodynamics. As the thermallytriggered IMT occurs, VO2 temperature skyrockets even\nwhile VD discharges. Once the temperature of the discharged device has surpassed T0IM T , there is no way for\nit to cool thereafter. Power dissipation and temperature\nboth settle towards steady-state with the device firmly\nin the metallic state. The causes of this process will become more apparent as we discuss thermal dynamics in\nSection III D.\n\nB.\n\nElectrical triggering\n\nWith the failure of a temperature-only-triggering\nmodel to produce oscillations, and following insights\nfrom previous work on voltage-induced effects in\nVO2 ,22,26,37,38 we now introduce an electric-field driven\ntransition. To do this, we also assign a voltage drop at\nwhich each grain undergoes phase transition Vij\nIM T and\nVij\n.\nWe\nagain\nuse\nrandom\nvalues\nfrom\na\nnormal\ndisM IT\n\nFIG. 5.

From an\nenergetics perspective, this makes a great deal of sense\n- both distributions are surely tied to the same underlying Mott-physics. V0 remains a fitting parameter in our\nmodel.\nAs we have not removed possible thermal triggering,\nthe conditions for grain transition can now be stated as:\nRij = Rmet\n= Rins\n\nij\nij\n> TIM T ))\nif ((V ij > VIM\nT ) OR (T\n(11)\nij\nij\nif ((V ij < VM\n< TM IT ))\nIT ) AND (T\n(12)\n\nThis combined triggering criterion reproduces both the\nwaveshape and periodicity of the experimentally observed oscillations quite well. In Figure 5, we re-plot the\nexperimental data from Figure 2 in blue, and numerical\nresults from our model are shown overlaid in green.\nC.\n\nVoltage-temperature dependence\n\nAlthough section III B demonstrated voltage is the primary trigger, device temperature still plays a role in oscillations. There is a known dependence of oscillation\namplitude on device temperature25 . If we look carefully\nat the data in Figure 5, we notice a subtle decay envelope to the amplitude of the VIM T oscillation peaks. We\nbelieve this envelope is caused by a thermalization of the\ndevice on a multi-oscillation timescale. To accommodate\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 6. Experimental data (blue) for oscillations over a long\n100\u03bcs Vapp pulse. We observe a clear decay envelope to the\namplitude of VIM T in the oscillations. For clarity, the bottom\nhalf of the oscillations are omitted as we observe no enveloping\nhere. To show this decay is a thermalization envelope caused\nby device heating, we also plot the temperature dependent\nV0IM T (T ) from equation 13 (red).\n\nthis, we include a temperature-dependence to the IMT\ntransition voltage as\nij\nij\nVIM\nT (T ) \u2192 (\u03ba(T \u2212 T0 ) + 1)VIM T\n\n(13)\n\nwhere T0 =295o K. \u03ba is a liner temperature coefficient, the\nfitting of which we discuss below. Without including this\nvoltage-temperature interplay, our model quickly loses\nsync with the experimental data over the course of several\noscillation periods. This thermalization envelope is most\nclearly observed over a long pluse, and experimental data\n(solid blue) for a 100\u03bcs pulse is shown in Figure 6. For\nclarity in this figure, the bottom half of the oscillations is\nomitted from view (interestingly, we observe no envelope\nof VM IT ).\nUsing the data from Figure 6 combined with our\nthermal-finite element model, we can fit a value for \u03ba.\nOverlaid on the experimental data (dashed line) is this\nfit, which gives \u03ba = \u22128.3x10\u22123 . This value of \u03ba is used\nin our oscillation model.\nExplanation of this a long time-scale thermalization is\nstraightforward. Although locally the VO2 film may heat\nor cool quite quickly in response to current through its\nvolume, the 500\u03bcm thick sapphire substrate is comparatively massive. The large thermal inertia of the substrate\nsmooths out oscillatory heating away from the film; and\nwhen heated only from the top the substrate can require\ntens of micro-seconds to reach a steady-state temperature\ngradient.\n\nD.\n\nTemperature dynamics\n\nIn the above Section III C we have discussed the critical\ninterplay between temperature and voltage-triggering,\nshowing how a long multi-oscillation timescale thermalization envelopes the oscillation amplitude. In this section, we look closer at the temperature evolution on the\ntimescale of the oscillation period.\n\nFIG. 7. Model results of temperature dynamics during VD oscillations. The horizontal dashed line at TIM T =340o K shows\nmean transition temperature, and demonstrates that the average temperature reached during oscillations falls short of\nwhat's needed to drive the IMT transition. We also divide\nthe oscillation into insulating/charging regions(I) and metallic/discharge regions(II). This draws attention to the sharp\nincrease in temperature which occurs only after the VIM T\ntrigger, qualitatively discrediting a thermal-driving picture\nfor oscillations.\n\nTo begin, in Figure 7 we plot the average grain temperature (red) during oscillations along with VD (green)\n- both from our model. Looking at Figure 7 quantitatively, we notice that the average temperature reached is\nnot sufficient to trigger oscillations. Although the peak\naverage temperature during the discharge cycle of the oscillation comes close to reaching TIM T , a thermal-driving\nevent would have to occur at-or-before the peak in VD .\nThe model results indicate that the device is well below TIM T when VD:IM T is reached. The temperature\nrange in Figure 7 agrees fairly well with previous numerical work on the subject39 , and our own investigations using commercial finite element package COMSOL.\nCompared to COMSOL, our home-grown finite-element\ncode over-estimates temperatures reached - perhaps due\nto difficulty in modeling all of the spatially massive substrate (this is not an issue for commercial packages such\nas COMSOL). However, commercial codes cannot be run\nfrom within Runge-Kutta time-stepping of equation 1,\nand our code thus critically allows us to calculate temperature dynamics during oscillations.\nAlthough a quantitative argument for non-thermal\ntriggering seems compelling, we are acutely aware that\nprecisely solving for temperature can be difficult in such\nnanoscale systems. Material properties can differ from\npublished bulk values, and interface effects can dominate\ntransport and heating40 . As we look closely though, the\npower dissipation in the device also appears qualitatively\nunfit to explain the oscillations. A thermally-driven transition would have to follow the logical sequence:\nI The insulating device heats with applied VD until it\nreaches TIM T , where it undergoes an IMT (becoming metallic).\nII The metallic device discharges its stored capacitive\nenergy through the its own volume - cooling as it\n\n\f6\n\nIn this section, we go into further detail on the mechanisms of the IMT and MIT transitions. Polycrystalline\nVO2 is known to exhibit percolative behavior during\nphase transition2,26,34,43 , and this has interesting effects\non a voltage-triggered transition. Using the model from\nSection III which accurately predicts the observed electrical oscillations, we attempt to gain insight on several\nof the internal processes during oscillatory events.\n\nstochastic distribution for Vij\nIM T (see Equation 9), this\ncan be a random grain anywhere in the network. In experiments, it is seen that the phase-transition is often\nseeded at particular places such as defects or boundaries.\nThe unlucky grain that first hits its IMT trigger condition undergoes an IMT. Once this grain becomes metallic, it supports a lower voltage drop (Rins /Rmet \u2248 20)\n- which shifts much of its voltage burden to neighboring grains. The neighboring grains in turn become increasingly likely to undergo their own IMT events. The\nIMT spreads across the entire sample in an avalanchelike manner. This process is depicted in Figure 8a for a\nnetwork of 50x50 grains. The upper sequence of black\nand white frames shows whether each grain is insulating (white) or metallic (black). The lower color frames\ndepict the voltage drop across each grain. The neighborneighbor grain interaction, mediated by voltage drop is\nquite evident.\nAs is common in percolative systems, the Thevenin\nresistance RD of the network is quite sensitive to the\nspatial distribution of triggered grains. The device resistivity RD is shown above each frame in the sequence of\nFigure 8, and we see the largest drop occurs in frames #6\nand 7, where the percolation path is completed from left\nto right. Once a conducting path forms RD plummets,\nand VD begins to drop as the device discharges.\nDuring discharge, there comes a point where VD drops\nfar enough that a similar process happens in reverse. This\nMIT is depicted in Figure 8b. However, the MIT process\nis not exactly the reverse of the IMT. The equations governing resistors in parallel tend to \"favor\" low-resistances\nin the following manner: Decreasing the value of one resistor (in a parallel network) lowers the Thevenin resistance significantly, but raising the value of a single resistor has only a little effect on the Thevenin resistance.\nFor this reason, the avalanche-like behavior observed in\nFigure 8a is not seen in Figure 8b. Instead, the process\nmuch more closely resembles random percolation, with\nonly moderate neighbor-neighbor interaction. This difference in the mechanisms between IMT and MIT may\nexplain the difference in sharpness of the transitions at\nVDIM T and VDIM T observed in experiments.24\n\nA.\n\nB.\n\ndischarges - until it reaches TM IT where it undergoes\nMIT (becoming insulating).\nIII The process repeats.\nHowever, Figure 7 illustrates that region II which occurs after VD:IM T is a region of maximum power dissipation; a region of heating not cooling. A simple ohms-law\nargument explains: Just before and just after the IMT,\nVD is approximately VD:IM T . However, the resistance\nRD has changed by a factor of 10, and thus the power\ndissipated (P=V2D:IM T /RD ) is substantially greater during region II than during region I. Thus, we come to\nthe conclusion that a purely-thermal explanation for the\noscillations is qualitatively as well as quantitatively mismatched to experimental data.\nSummarizing Section III, we have identified voltage\nas a key player in triggering observed oscillations on\nthe grounds of several thermal arguments. One interesting question then is whether electrostatic voltage\nmay also trigger the also IMT in a current-free (ie.\nFET) configuration. The joule-heating present in our\ntwo-terminal device complicates matters, in light of the\nvoltage/temperature interplay identified in Section III C.\nPrevious work has suggested such electrostatic switching\ncan exist,6,41,42 although these early results await further\nconfirmation. Exploring the phase-space defined by the\ninterplay of temperature, electrostatic field, and current\nin these VO2 oscillations may reveal information about\nthe correlated electron dynamics and energy scales associated with the Mott-transition.\nIV.\n\nPERCOLATION\n\nPercolative avalanche driven oscillations\n\nIn several previous works26,27 , avalanche-like MIT and\nIMT transitions have been observed under the right conditions. The immediacy of the observed change from\ncharging to discharging in our oscillations leads us to suspect similar avalanche behavior in our electrically-driven\ndevice. Examining the details of our model, we see that\nthe voltage drop across any grain in the network (see Figure 3) is proportional to the resistance of the grain. During the charging cycle of the waveform voltage across the\nentire device (VD ) increases, and Vij across each grain\ndoes as well. This charging continues until one \"unlucky\"\ngrain hits its Vij\nIM T first. Because the grains receive a\n\nEffective medium effects\n\nThe percolative nature of the VO2 phase transition allows for an inhomogeneous intermediate state where both\nmetallic and insulating VO2 coexist. The dielectric constants of metal and insulating phase VO2 are distinct;\nand when both phases can be present in a composite it\nleads to interesting properties. The average response of\nthe inhomogeneous sample is described by an effective\nmedium, and can have radically different values than either. This leads to quite interesting and novel effects. For\nexample, the inhomogeneity2,35 of polycrystalline VO2\nmid-transition is responsible for observed memristance19\nand memory-capacitance15,28 .\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 8. Step-by-step depiction of the avalanche-like transition for a 50x50 grain network. The time of each frame increases\nfrom left to right. a) shows the IMT transition occurring at VD:IM T , giving a bi-color plot (top) indicating whether each grain\nis metallic or insulating and the the voltage (bottom) across each grain in the network. b) shows the same plots for the MIT\ntransition occurring at VD:M IT .\n\nThe same memory-capacitance as reported in15 has\npreviously been attributed as playing a key role in\nvoltage-controlled oscillations in VO2 24 . This is a question we are situated to investigate in more depth using\nour model. To look closely at the effects of capacitance\non the oscillations, we focus attention on a single IMT\ntransition event. In Figure 9, we plot CD (t) (as calculated from equations 2-4), along with the familiar VD\nand RD .\nLooking at Figure 9, as VO2 transitions from insulating to metallic at the IMT, RD drops monotonically to\nits metallic-state value. The capacitance CD , however,\nbriefly increases before also decreasing to its metallicstate value. This increase is due to the coexistence of\nmetallic and insulating grains, and is predicted by effective medium (Equation 4). However, as Figure 9 shows,\nthe increase in CD is a small effect, and is contained to a\nshort timespan near the start of the IMT. This leads us\nto believe the effective medium behavior of CD has only\na minor influence on the shape of the oscillations, and is\nnot a primary driver. We observe the same increase in\nCD at the MIT transition edge, but it also is too small\nand short-lived an effect to bear responsibility for the\noscillations.\n\nFIG. 9. Model values for CD plotted with VD and RD over\none oscillation period. Effective medium within the VO2 (see\nEquation 2) causes a brief spike in CD at immediately near\nthe IMT and MIT transitions. As seen, this spike effect is\nquite small compared to the overall change of both CD and\nRD , and exists only for a very brief fraction of the oscillation\nperiod. The jagged shape of the model curves for RD and\nCD reveal the small jumps typical of percolation discussed in\nSection IV A\n\nV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this work, we have discussed the thermal and electrical driving mechanisms behind observed oscillations occurring in VO2 films. In addition to experimentally confirming the oscillations reported by Y.W. Lee et.al.22 , we\nhave compiled a numerical model which is able to replicate and explain these oscillations in terms of an voltagetriggered Insulator-to-Metal phase-transition. Tempera-\n\n\f8\nture is known to trigger the IMT in VO2 , and temperature plays some role in the shape of the oscillations. However, we find that temperature-only triggering cannot explain oscillations. This result is likely of great importance\nfor applications of these oscillations, as repeated thermalcycling typically appreciably shortens device lifetime.\nOne question that remains unaddressed is the role, if\nany, of the structural phase transition in an electric-field\ntriggered transition. The temperature driven IMT in\nVO2 exhibits a structural transition that happens concurrent with the electronic reconfiguration. However, there\nis evidence2,6,34,44\u201349 to suggest the electronic and structural transitions are not necessarily linked, but merely\noverlaid. This structural electronic decoupling suggests\nthe electronic correlations in VO2 play an important role\nin the IMT phase transition.\nStudies which probe the crystal structure simultaneous with these oscillations have not yet been reported\n- likely because the time and length scales associated\nwith the VO2 oscillator devices greatly complicate experiments such as x-ray diffraction. However, as mentioned\nin the introduction (Section I) the question of whether\nor not the structural transition occurs has great implications about the longevity of these devices. In many\napplications, devices could easily be expected to perform\n1012 to 1014 oscillation events over their lifetime, a likely\nimpossibility if crystallographic changes are occurring.\nAn evident goal for the new future is to experimentally\ninvestigate the existence of structural transition in oscillations in the near future.\n\nVI.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nT.D. acknowledges support from an IC postdoctoral\nfellowship.
