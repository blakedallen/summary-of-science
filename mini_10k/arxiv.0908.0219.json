For example, it is well known that the canonical\nensemble is not defined in asymptotically flat space. This is because having thermal radiation at constant\ntemperature at infinity is not compatible with asymptotic flatness. One can avoid this problem by enclosing\nthe system in a box, which is unphysical, or by working in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space which needs not any unphysical perfectly reflecting walls at finite radius, the rising gravitational potential in AdS space, plus natural\nboundary conditions at infinity, acts to confine whatever is inside. On the other hand, due to the conjecture\nof AdS/CFT correspondence [1], which says that string theory/M theory on an AdS space (times a compact\nmanifold) is dual to a strong coupling conformal field theory (CFT) residing on the boundary of the AdS\nspace, over the past decade, a lot of attention has been focused on AdS space and relevant physics. Further,\nWitten [2] argued that thermodynamics of black holes in AdS space can be identified to that of dual strong\ncoupling CFTs. Therefore one could study thermodynamics and phase structure of strong coupling CFTs by\ninvestigating thermodynamics and phase structure of AdS black holes. It is well-known that thermodynamics\nof AdS black holes is quite different from that of their counterparts in asymptotically flat space and that there\nis a Hawking-Page phase transition between large black hole and thermal radiation in AdS space [3]. Therefore\nit is also of great interest to study self-gravitating configurations in AdS space and their thermodynamics.\nSelf-gravitating radiation gas has been investigated thoroughly. Sorkin, Wald and Zhang [4] have studied\nthe equilibrium configurations of self-gravitating radiation in a spherical box of radius R in asymptotically\nflat space. It was found that for locally stable configuration, the total gravitational mass of radiation obeys\nthe inequality M < \u03bcmax R, where \u03bcmax = 0.246. In AdS space, Page and Philips [5] examined the selfgravitating configuration of radiation in four dimensional space-time. The configuration can be labeled as its\nmass, entropy and temperature versus the central energy density. They found that there exist locally stable\nradiation configurations all the way up to a maximum red-shifted temperature, above which there are no\nsolutions; there is also a maximum mass and maximum entropy configuration occurring at a higher central\ndensity than the maximal temperature configuration. Beyond their peaks the temperature, mass and entropy\nundergo an infinite series of damped oscillations, which indicates the configurations in this regime are unstable.\nThe self-gravitating radiation in five dimensional AdS space has been studied in [6] (see also [7]) with similar\n\n\f3\nconclusions. Recently, Vaganov [8] and Hammersley [9] independently discussed the self-gravitating radiation\nconfigurations in higher dimensional AdS spaces. They found that in the case of 4 \u2264 d \u2264 10, the situation\nis qualitatively similar to the case in four dimensions, while d \u2265 11, the oscillation behavior disappears.\nNamely, there is a critical dimension, dc.ads = 11 (very close, but not exact), beyond which, the temperature,\nmass and entropy of the self-gravitating configuration are monotonic functions of the central energy density,\nasymptoting to their maxima as the central density goes to infinity. The equilibrium configurations of selfgravitating radiation gas in AdS space are quite different from those of their counterparts in asymptotically\nflat space.\nRecently Chavanis investigated spherically symmetric equilibrium configurations of relativistic stars with\na linear equation of state P = a\u03c1 in flat space [10]. The equation of state P = a\u03c1 says the pressure P\nis proportional to the energy density \u03c1, where a is a ratio coefficient. Theoretically, different coefficients\ncorrespond to different stars, although it is impossible to define names for all the stars corresponding to each\ncoefficient. The speed of sound is given by (dP/d\u03c1)2 c = a2 c, where c is the speed of light. Thus causality\nrequires a2 \u2264 1. As a result, 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1 is considered only. One could identify relativistic stars by an equation\nof state with their different ratio coefficients. In the Newtonian limit a \u2192 0, it returns the classical isothermal\nequation of state. On the other hand, the case with a = 1/(d \u2212 1), where d is the dimension of space-time,\ncorresponds to a gas of self-gravitating radiation; the core of neutron stars or so called \"photon stars\" where\nthe pressure is entirely due to radiation. A gas of baryons interacting through a vector meson field for the\ncase of a = 1 is called the \"stiffest\" star. Chavanis found that the structure of the system is highly dependent\non the dimensionality of space-time and that the oscillations in the mass-central density profile disappear\nabove a critical dimension dc.f lat (a) depending on the coefficient a. Above this dimension, the equilibrium\nconfigurations are stable for any central density, contrary to the case d < dc.f lat . For Newtonian isothermal\nstars (a \u2192 0), the critical dimension dc.f lat (0) = 11. For the stiffest stars (a = 1), dc.f lat (1) = 10 and for a\nself-gravitating radiation(a = 1/(d \u2212 1)), dc.f lat = 1 + 9.96404372... very close to 11. The oscillations exist for\nany a \u2208 [0, 1] when d \u2264 10 and they cease to exist for any a \u2208 [0, 1] when d \u2265 11.\nIn a previous paper [11], we have studied self-gravitating radiation configurations with plane symmetry in\nAdS space and found that the situation is quite different from the one in spherically symmetric AdS space.\nIn the present paper we continue this study and consider the self-gravitating configurations with a linear\nequation of state P = a\u03c1 in higher (d \u2265 4)-dimensional spherically symmetric AdS space, in order to see the\ndependence of the critical dimension on the parameter a and to see whether there is any essential difference\n\n\f4\nbetween the configurations in flat space and the configurations in AdS space.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we give a general formulism to describe\nthe relativistic stars with a linear equation of state P = a\u03c1 in AdS space. The numerical results are given in\nSec. III. The Sec. IV is devoted to the conclusions.\nII.\n\nRELATIVISTIC STARS WITH LINEAR EQUATION OF STATE IN ADS SPACE\n\nConsider a d-dimensional asymptotically AdS space with metric\nds2 = \u2212e2\u03b4(r) h(r)dt2 + h\u22121 (r)dr2 + r2 \u03b3ij dxi dxj ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4 and h are two functions of the radial coordinate r, and \u03b3ij is the metric of a (d \u2212 2)-dimensional\nEinstein manifold with constant scalar curvature (d \u2212 2)(d \u2212 3). We take the gauge limr\u2192\u221e \u03b4(r) = 0, and\nrewrite the metric function h(r) as\nh(r) = 1 +\n\nr2\n16\u03c0Gm(r)\n\u2212\n,\nl2\n(d \u2212 2)\u03a9rd\u22123\n\n(2)\n\nwhere l denotes the radius of the AdS space with cosmological constant \u039b = \u2212(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2)/2l2, \u03a9 is the\nvolume of the Einstein manifold, and m(r) is the mass function of the solution. In this gauge, the total\ngravitational mass of the solution is just\nM = lim m(r).\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(3)\n\nThe Einstein field equations with the cosmological constant and energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd are\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2)\n1\ng\u03bc\u03bd = 8\u03c0GT\u03bc\u03bd .\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R \u2212\n2\n2l2\n\n(4)\n\nThe metric function \u03b4(r) and the mass function m(r) satisfy the following equations\n\u03b4 \u2032 (r) = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n8\u03c0Gr\nT tt \u2212 T rr ,\n(d \u2212 2)h(r)\n\nm\u2032 (r) = \u2212\u03a9rd\u22122 T tt .\n\n(5)\n\nThe stress-energy tensor of perfect fluid is T\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + P )U\u03bc U\u03bd + P g\u03bc\u03bd , where U\u03bc is the four-velocity of the\nfluid. For self-gravitating radiation, the equation of state obeys P = \u03c1/(d \u2212 1). For linear relativistic stars,\nP = a\u03c1 with a \u2208 [0, 1]. Thus the equations in (5) reduce to\n\u03b4 \u2032 (r) =\n\n8\u03c0Gr\n(1 + a)\u03c1,\n(d \u2212 2)h(r)\n\nm\u2032 (r) = \u03a9rd\u22122 \u03c1.\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\f5\nM\n\n0.8\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0.4\n\n15\n\n20\n\nLog \u03a1 0\n\na = 1\u0090Hd-1L\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 1: The self-gravitating radiation in AdS space: The mass of the self-gravitating radiation configuration versus\nthe central energy density from dimension d = 4 (top curve) to d = 12 (bottom curve).\n\nIn this paper we are particularly interested in the relation between the total mass of configuration and the\ncentral energy density. To integrate (6) and (7), we make a scaling transformation as follows,\nr \u2192 l r,\n\n\u03c1 \u2192 l\u22122 \u03c1,\n\nm(r) \u2192 ld\u22123 m(r),\n\n(8)\n\nso that r, \u03c1 and m become dimensionless. In the numerical integration, we will adopt the units 8\u03c0G = 1 and\nl = 1, and rescale the mass function as\n16\u03c0Gm(r)/(d \u2212 2)\u03a9 \u2192 m(r).\nIn that case, the gravitational \"mass\" M in the plots in the next section in fact is the gravitational mass\ndensity, 16\u03c0GM/(d \u2212 2)\u03a9, of corresponding relativistic star configurations. From the conservation of the\nenergy-momentum tensor, one can derive the energy density \u03c1(r) satisfies the following equation\nd\u03c1\n(a + 1)\u03c1r\n=\ndr\n2a\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u22123 d\u22121\nd\u22123\n2a\u03c1\n\u2212\n\u2212 2\n\u2212\nr2\nh(r)\nr h(r) (d \u2212 2)h(r)\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\nFurther, note that the equations (7) and (9) are singular at r = 0. To avoid this, in the numerical calculations,\nwe will start the integration from r = \u01eb = 10\u22125 to r = L = 100. Obviously, the accuracy of the numerical\ncalculations depends on the values of \u01eb and L.\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nTo be more clear to discuss all kinds of critical dimensions of relativistic stars with a linear equation of state\nin AdS space, let us first revisit the self-gravitating radiation case. In [9] Hammersley found that in the case\nof 4 \u2264 d \u2264 10, there exist locally stable radiation configurations all the way up to a maximum mass, beyond\n\n\f6\n10 8-2 d Hd - 3 L2 M\na = 0.5\n\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nLog \u03a1 0\n\nFIG. 2: The case of a = 0.5 in AdS space: The mass of relativistic star configurations versus the central energy density\nfrom dimension d = 4 (bottom curve) to d = 12 (top curve).\n\ntheir peaks the curves undergo an infinite series of damped oscillations, which indicates the configurations\nin this regime are unstable. However, with d \u2265 11, the oscillation behavior disappears. The configurations\nturn to be monotonic functions of the central energy density, asymptoting to their maxima as the central\ndensity goes to infinity. Namely, there is a critical dimension. By numerical analysis, Hammersley [9] found\na semi-empirical model\nlog \u03c1c \u2248 0.50d + \u221a\n\n5.75\n\u2212 2.20,\n11.0 \u2212 d\n\n(10)\n\nwhich gives a critical dimension dc.ads = 11, and a similar conclusion was also reached by Vaganov [8]\nindependently. We reproduce the result in Fig. 1.\nNow we turn to the case of relativistic stars with a linear equation of state P = a\u03c1. Due to the requirement\nof causality, we consider the cases with 0 \u2264 a \u2264 1. In Fig. 2, we plot the mass of relativistic stars configurations\nversus the central energy density from dimension d = 4 to d = 12 for the case of a = 0.5. Note that in Fig. 2\nwe rescale the mass M with scale 108\u22122d (d\u22123)2 in each dimension for better displaying all curves in one figure.\nWe notice that for a certain value of a, the configurations of different dimensions from 4 to 12 are similar to\nthe case of self-gravitating radiation stars. For the case of lower dimensions, there exist obvious oscillations\nwhich can be seen from Fig 3. As for the higher dimensions, the oscillations become weaker and weaker,\nand finally beyond some critical dimensions, configurations become monotonic functions of the central energy\ndensity. Fig. 4 is the case of d = 11. Note that in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 each curve corresponds to each relativistic\nstar with coefficient a which undergoes a continuous variation from 0.01 to 1.0 with step 0.1, and also we\nrescale the mass density M to M/Mmax in each case of coefficient a for better comparing those different cases.\nAs a matter of fact, it is not really accurate to determine the critical dimensions only by the naked eyes to\n\n\f7\nM\nMmax\n1.0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nLog \u03a1 0\n\n0.6\nd=4\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 3: The case of d=4 in AdS space: The mass of relativistic star configurations versus the central energy density\nfrom the coefficient a = 1 (left curve) to a = 0.01 (right curve).\nM\nMmax\n1.0\n\n0.8\nd = 11\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nLog \u03a1 0\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 4: The case of d=11 in AdS space: The mass of relativistic star configurations versus the central energy density\nfrom the coefficient a = 1 (left curve) to a = 0.01 (right curve).\n\nwatch these curves. To be more accurate to determine the critical dimensions, we take the numerical analysis\napproach. In Fig. 5 one can see clearly that for each curve there exists a saturation point, log \u03c1c (the red dot in\nthe figure), which is the location of the first local maximum. The saturation point moves towards the right side\nas the dimension d increases. Beyond the saturation points, the curves undergo an infinite series of damped\noscillations. When the dimension increases, the oscillations become weaker and weaker, while the saturation\npoint log \u03c1c becomes larger and larger, and finally, beyond a critical dimension dc.ads , the saturation point\nlog \u03c1c goes to infinity. So we can determine the critical dimension by analyzing the variation of the saturation\npoints.\nSome data of saturation points log \u03c1c are listed in Table I.

The blue hollow dots are the scattered data of the\ncritical dimensions dc.ads (a). The red dashed curve is the case of linear fitting. The blue dashed curve is the case of\nthe third-order fitting. The black thick curve is the case of average fitting.\n\nIn Fig. 6 we plot the scattered diagram of the critical dimensions dc.ads (a) versus the coefficient a. It can be\nseen that the value of dc.ads (a) becomes smaller and smaller as the value of the coefficient a goes from 0 to 1.\nSo dc.ads (a) can be considered to be a monotonic function of the coefficient a. The red dashed line in Fig. 6 is\nthe result of a linear numerical fitting for these scattered data. It could be seen that for all kinds of relativistic\nstars with a linear equation of state P = a\u03c1 (a \u2208 [0, 1]), the critical dimensions dc.ads (a) \u2208 [10.1063, 11.1601].\nObviously, the lower and upper bounds of dc.ads (a) for this kind of fitting are a little wider because these\nscattered data are not really linear related. To obtain more accurate results, we need to adopt non-linear\nfitting which could better fit the scattered data. The results of the second and third-order fitting are listed\nin Table III. The blue dashed curve in Fig. 6 is the case of the third-order fitting. Note that the curve of\nthe second-order fitting is not plotted in Fig. 6 because it is overlapped with the most of the linear fitting\ncurve. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that the curve of the third-order fitting can better fit the scattered data.\nNamely, in AdS space for all kinds of relativistic stars with a linear equation of state P = a\u03c1 (a \u2208 [0, 1])\nthe critical dimensions dc.ads (a) \u2208 [10.1763, 11.1097]. The minimum for the stiffest star in AdS space is\ndc.ads (1) = 10.1763 and the maximum for the Newtonian isothermal star is dc.ads (0) = 11.1097. In Fig. 7\nwe plot the saturation points log \u03c1c versus the dimension d for each relativistic star (corresponding to each\ncoefficient a ) from a = 0.1 (right blue curve) to a = 1.0 (left red curve) in the range 9.4 \u2264 d \u2264 11.4. The low\nand up bounds of the critical dimensions dc.ads (a) \u2208 [10.1763, 11.1097] are also plotted in this figure (the blue\n\n\f10\n25\n\n20\n\nlog\u03c1c\n\n15\n\n10\n\nd=10.1291 \u2192\n\nd=11.1429 \u2192\n\n5\n\u2190 d=10.1763\n\n0\n9.4\n\n9.6\n\n9.8\n\n10\n\n10.2\n\n10.4\n\nd=11.1097 \u2192\n\n10.6\n\n10.8\n\n11\n\n11.2\n\n11.4\n\nd\nFIG. 7: The saturation points \u03c1c versus the dimension d from a = 0.1 (right blue curve) to a = 1.0 (left red curve).

The\nblack thick curves are the low and up bounds of the critical dimensions dc.ads.aver (a) \u2208 [10.1291, 11.1429], respectively.\n\ndashed curves). One can find that for the stiffest stars (a = 1), the left red curve increases steeply and finally\nup to a critical dimension d = 10.1763. However, for Newtonian isothermal stars a \u2192 0, the right blue curve\nchanges more slowly, up to the critical dimension d = 11.1097.\nBy an analysis of asymptotic behavior, Chavanis [10] found that the critical dimension runs from d = 10\nto 11 when the coefficient a decreases from a = 1 to 0 in flat space. Namely the difference of dimension\n\u25b3df lat = dc.f lat (0) \u2212 dc.f lat (1) = 1. In our case, namely in AdS space, the critical dimension runs from\nd = 11.1097 to 10.1763 with \u25b3dads = dc.ads (0) \u2212 dc.ads (1) = 0.9334 when a varies from 0 to 1. If taking the\naveraged values, then one has \u25b3dads = dc.ads.aver (0) \u2212 dc.ads.aver (1) = 11.1429 \u2212 10.1291 = 1.0138. There\nexists some difference between the flat and AdS cases. Therefore we guess that for all kinds of relativistic\nstars with a linear equation of state regardless of in AdS and flat spaces, the critical dimensions dc.ads (a)\nand dc.f lat (a) vary just within 1 dimension when a changes from 0 to 1, and the inaccuracy between the two\ncases is very small, within 1.38%. Therefor the critical dimension for a stable relativistic stars with a linear\nequation of state is 12, rather than 11, which is the case of self-gravitating radiation configurations.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThere exists a critical dimension for self-gravitating configurations in general relativity, beyond which the\nconfigurations with any central energy density are always stable; below which there exists a maximal mass\n\n\f11\nconfiguration for a certain central energy density, when the central energy density increases, the configuration\nbecomes unstable. In this paper we studied the self-gravitating configurations (relativistic stars) with a linear\nequation of state P = a\u03c1 in AdS space, where a is a constant parameter within a \u2208 [0, 1]. We found that the\ncritical dimension depends on the parameter a, it runs from d = 11.1097 to 10.1763 in the third order fitting\nas a varies from a = 0 to 1. The result is a little different from the case in flat space. It runs from d = 11.1429\nto 10.1291 if one takes the averaged fitting. In that case, it is very close to the case in flat space within the\ninaccuracy 1.38%. Therefore it is of interest to study the self-gravitating configurations in de Sitter space and\nto see whether there exist any differences among the three cases.\nIn [8] and [9], it was found that the critical dimension of self-gravitating radiation configurations is d = 11.\nCombing the results obtained in [11] and in the present paper, we see that in fact, the dimension d = 11\nmight not have any other special physical meaning, except for the stability divide. Note that the fact that no\nspecial happens for thermodynamics of AdS Schwarzschild black holes in d \u2265 4, it is of interest to understand\nthe meaning of the existence of the critical dimension in the AdS/CFT correspondence.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported partially by grants from NSFC, China (No. 10821504 and No. 10525060), a grant\nfrom the Chinese Academy of Sciences with No. KJCX3-SYW-N2.\n\n[1] J.
