In this paper, we specifically investigate the matter of approximating the quantum tori by matrix algebras generated by unitaries in finite\ndimension, which is suggested for instance in [4, sec. 3.3].\nWe start by recalling the foundations of the quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance theory. Rieffel introduced in [27] a notion of convergence for compact\nquantum metric spaces [25], which generalizes to noncommutative geometry\nthe Gromov-Hausdorff distance [10, Ch.3] between isometry classes of compact metric spaces. A compact quantum metric space (A, L), as defined in [25]\nand [27], is an order-unit space A endowed with a seminorm L such that the\ndual distance dL , defined for any two states \u03bc, \u03bd of A by\ndL (\u03bc, \u03bd) = sup{|\u03bc(a) \u2212 \u03bd(a)| : a \u2208 A, L(a) \u2264 1},\n\n(1.1)\n\ninduces the weak* topology on the state space S(A) of A. Such a seminorm\nis called a Lip-norm. The classical examples of Lip-norms are the Lipschitz\nseminorms on C(X) for any compact metric space (X, d) (see [7, sec. 11.3,\nTheorem 11.3.3]). Rieffel's definition refines an idea in [2][3, Chapter VI].\nNow, let (A, L) and (B, L\u2032 ) be two compact quantum metric spaces with respective state spaces S(A) and S(B). Let C(L, L\u2032 ) be the set of Lip-norms on\nthe order-unit space A \u2295 B whose quotients on A (resp. B) are the Lip-norm\nL (resp. L\u2032 ). Rieffel proves in [27] that C(L, L\u2032 ) is nonempty, and defines the\nquantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance by setting:\ndistq ((A, L), (B, L\u2032 )) = inf {H[dL\u2032\u2032 ] (S(A), S(B)) : L\u2032\u2032 \u2208 C(L, L\u2032 )} ,\nwhere H[dL\u2032\u2032 ] is the Hausdorff distance induced by the distance dL\u2032\u2032 on the\nweak*-closed subsets of the state space S(A \u2295 B) of A \u2295 B, and where dL\u2032\u2032 is\ndefined by (1.1).\nWe now turn to the problem resolved in this paper. Let G be a compact\nAbelian group endowed with a continuous length function l, and denote by e\nthe unit of G. The length function l induced a metric dl on the group G by\nsetting dl (g \u2032, g) = l(g \u22121 g \u2032 ) for all g, g \u2032 \u2208 G, and dl in turn generates a topology\n\u03c42 on G. We denote by \u03c41 the original (compact) topology of G, and we denote\nby H(l) the Hausdorff distance defined by dl on the closed subsets of G. We\nmake the following simple observation:\nLemma 1.1 We have: \u03c41 = \u03c42 . The group G is therefore separable. In particular, if (Xn )n\u2208N is a sequence of closed subsets of G converging to G for H(l),\nthen\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nXn is dense in G.\n\nn=0\n\nPROOF. Since l is continuous, it is immediate that \u03c42 \u2286 \u03c41 . The other inclusion is from a standard argument [28] which we include here for convenience.\n2\n\n\fLet F be a closed set for \u03c41 . Since (G, \u03c41 ) is compact, F is compact as well.\nSince \u03c42 \u2286 \u03c41 , the set F is compact for \u03c42 as well. Since \u03c42 is Hausdorff, the set\nF is closed in (G, \u03c42 ). Hence \u03c41 = \u03c42 . The topology \u03c41 is compact and metrizable under our assumptions, hence G is separable. Now, since (Xn )n\u2208N converges to G for H(l), we have by definition that for any \u03b5 > 0 and g \u2208 G there\nexists N \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 N the \u03c42 -open ball {x \u2208 G : l(x\u22121 g) < \u03b5}\nintersects Xn . Hence all open balls in \u03c42 intersect\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nXn , which is therefore\n\nn=0\n\ndense in \u03c42 , hence in \u03c41 . \u2737\n\nRemark 1.2 Lemma (1.1) shows that we do not lose any generality by working with a group G endowed with a length function l which generates a compact\ntopology on G, or with a separable compact group G, which can always be endowed with a continuous length function. Varying the length function on G is\nthe subject of Theorem (4.4).\nb Of course, G\nb is\nThe Pontryagin topological dual group of G is denoted by G.\nb by A(G),\nb and endow\ndiscrete.

Let us start by defining a\nb with its natural groupoid structure [21],\ntrivial group bundle \u03a9 = \u03a9(0) \u00d7 G\nwhere the space of units \u03a9(0) is defined by:\n\u0010 \u0011\n\nn\n\nb :\u03c3\u2208A\n\u03a9(0) = (n, \u03c3) \u2208 N\u00d7A G\nn\n\no\n\nand thus the multiplication of (n, \u03c3, \u03c7) \u2208 \u03a9 and (n\u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 , \u03c7\u2032 ) \u2208 \u03a9 is defined if\nand only if n = n\u2032 and \u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2032 and is then given by (n, \u03c3, \u03c7\u03c7\u2032 ).\nb \u00d7 G,\nb thus it is\nThe groupoid \u03a9 is topologized simply as a subset of N \u00d7 A(G)\na metrizable locally compact space by construction. It is straightforward that\nthe multiplication of the groupoid \u03a9 is continuous on the sets of composable\nb and just as easily one checks\npairs by continuity of the multiplication in G,\nthat the inverse map of \u03a9 is continuous. Hence, \u03a9 is a topological groupoid as\ndefined in [21, Definition 2.1, p. 16]. In addition, if \u03bc is the counting measure of\nb then the constant function u \u2208 \u03a9(0) 7\u2192 \u03bc is obviously a (left) Haar system\nG,\non \u03a9. Yet, we will not use this Haar system here.\n\nNow, the groupoid \u03a9 contains the following subgroupoid, which is itself a\ngroup bundle over \u03a9(0) :\n5\n\n\fe = {(n, \u03c3, \u03c7) \u2208 \u03a9 : \u03c7 \u2208 J } is a closed subgroupoid of \u03a9 and\nLemma 2.1 \u03a9\nn\ne (0) = \u03a9(0) .\n\u03a9\ne is a subgroupoid of \u03a9 with the same unit space\nPROOF. It is trivial that \u03a9\ne is closed in \u03a9. Since \u03a9 is metrizable, it is\n\u03a9(0) , so we shall only show that \u03a9\ne\nenough to check that \u03a9 is sequentially closed in \u03a9. Let (kn , \u03c3n , \u03c7n )n\u2208N be a\ne which converges in \u03a9 to (k, \u03c3, \u03c7). If k \u2208 N, then there exists\nsequence in \u03a9\nN \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 N we have kn = k, and therefore \u03c3n \u2208 Ak and\nb so\n\u03c7n \u2208 Jk . The group Jk is discrete and the group Ak is closed in A(G),\ne\n(\u03c3, \u03c7) \u2208 Ak \u00d7 Jk and thus (k, \u03c3, \u03c7) \u2208 \u03a9.\n\nb is discrete, there exists N \u2208 N such\nThe alternative case is k = \u221e. Since G\ne the character\nthat for all n \u2265 N we have \u03c7n = \u03c7. Therefore, by definition of \u03a9,\n\u03c7 of G is 1 on Hkn for all n \u2265 N. Yet, by assumption, (Hkn )n\u2208N converges\nto G for H(l), since (Hn )n\u2208N does and limn\u2192\u221e kn = \u221e. Hence by Lemma\nS\n(1.1), the subset \u221e\nn=N Hkn of G is dense in G. Since \u03c7 is continuous on G and\nconstant equal to 1 on a dense subset of G, it is the trivial character 1. Hence\ne\n(k, \u03c3, \u03c7) = (\u221e, \u03c3, 1) \u2208 \u03a9.\n\u2737\ne\nDefinition 2.2 Let \u0393 be the algebraic quotient space \u03a9\\\u03a9.\nFormally, \u0393 is the\nquotient space of the equivalence relation \u223c on \u03a9 defined for all x, y \u2208 \u03a9 by\ne\nx \u223c y if and only if (x, y) \u2208 \u03a9(2) and y \u22121 x \u2208 \u03a9.\n\nLemma 2.3 Endowed with the quotient topology and the quotient algebraic\nstructure, \u0393 is an amenable separable Hausdorff locally compact groupoid such\nthat its space of units is \u0393(0) = \u03a9(0) , and the canonical surjection q : \u03a9 \u2192 \u0393\nis an open epimorphism.\nPROOF. By [21, proposition (2.1), p. 75], \u0393 is a locally compact Hausdorff\nspace and q is open. Standard algebraic manipulations show that q defines a\ngroupoid structure on \u0393, which is again a trivial bundle of groups over \u03a9(0) .\nThe fiber of range (and source) (n, \u03c3) \u2208 \u0393(0) (= \u03a9(0) ) is just the discrete group\nd , hence the groupoid \u0393 is r-discrete. The map (n, \u03c3) \u2208 \u0393(0) 7\u2192 \u03bc , where\nH\nn\nn\nd , defines a left Haar system on \u0393. We fix\n\u03bcn is the counting measure on H\nn\nthis system in the rest of this paper. We remark that this Haar system is not\nobtained as the image of the Haar system on \u03a9 by q. Last, since G is separable,\nb so \u03a9 is separable and so is \u0393. Since H\nd is Abelian for any n \u2208 N, it is\nso is G,\nn\namenable and thus so is \u0393. \u2737\nMore generally, groupoids of this type were used in [12] as sources of counterexamples for the Baum-Connes conjecture, but this is not the direction we\nwill follow now.\n6\n\n\fIn the case of the two dimensional quantum tori, as well as some other special\ncases, it is interesting to note that a different groupoid can be constructed and\nserve the same purpose of obtaining continuous fields of C*-algebras. In fact,\nwe will provide here a construction which is more general than what we really\nneed for the purpose of this paper, but is worthy of interest none the less.\nWe consider a sequence (Xn )n\u2208N of closed subsets of a compact metric space\n(X\u221e , d), such that (Xn )n\u2208N converges to X\u221e for the Hausdorff distance H[d]\ndefined by d. For each n \u2208 N, we assume given a continuous action \u03b1n of\nd on the space X . We assume that for any \u03b5 > 0, any g \u2208 G\nb\nthe group H\nn\nn\nand any y \u2208 X\u221e , there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for all n \u2208 N, for all x \u2208 Xn\nd such that l(h\u22121 g) < \u03b4, we have\nsuch that d(x, y) < \u03b4 and for all h \u2208 H\nn\ng\nd(\u03b1nh (x), \u03b1\u221e\n(y)) \u2264 \u03b5.\no\n\nn\n\nb is a groupoid for the\nNow, the set \u0398 = (n, x, \u03c7) : n \u2208 N, x \u2208 Xn , \u03c7 \u2208 G\nmultiplication defined for (n, x, \u03c7) \u2208 \u0398 and (n\u2032 , x\u2032 , \u03c7\u2032 ) \u2208 \u0398 only when n = n\u2032\nand x\u2032 = \u03b1n\u03c7 (x) by setting (n, x, \u03c7)(n, \u03b1n\u03c7 (x), \u03c7\u2032 ) = (n, x, \u03c7\u03c7\u2032 ).\n\nIn particular, the unit space \u0398(0) of \u0398 is {(n, x, 1) : n \u2208 N, x \u2208 Xn }, the source\nmap is given by s\u0398 (n, x, \u03c7) = (n, x, 1) and the range map by r\u0398 (n, x, \u03c7) =\n(n, \u03b1n\u03c7 (x), 1) for all (n, x, \u03c7) \u2208 \u0398. The inverse of (n, x, \u03c7) is (n, \u03b1n\u03c7 (x), \u03c7\u22121 ).\nb Our assumption on\nNow, \u0398 is topologized naturally as a subset of N \u00d7 X \u00d7 G.\nthe coherence of the actions \u03b1n ensure that the multiplication in \u0398 and the\ne\ninverse map are continuous. Now, as before, we define two new groupoids \u0398\ne by \u0398\ne = {(n, x, \u03c7) \u2208 \u0398 : \u03c7 \u2208 J } and \u0393\ne = \u0398\\\u0398.\ne\nand \u0393\nAgain, the unit space\nn\n(0)\ne\ne\nof \u0393 is \u0398 .

This allows us to construct a natural left Haar system\ne and we will now see how this structure helps obtain a continuous field\non \u0393,\nof C*-algebras.\n\nExample 2.4 (Quantum Tori of dimension 2) With the notations of Example (1.4 ), we set Xn = U1n and X\u221e = T. Let \u03b8n \u2208 U1n for all n \u2208 N and\nd = Z1 acts on X by rotation by \u03b8 , and Z acts on T by\n\u03b8 \u2208 T. Then H\nn\nn\nn\nn\nrotation by \u03b8 as well. Of course Z \u00d7\u03b8 C(T) is a quantum torus.\n2.2 Continuous fields of twisted groupoid C* \u2013algebras\nWe recall the following definition from [20, Definition 2.1.1], also in [15, Definition 5.2]:\nDefinition 2.5 A continuous field of groupoids (G, p, T ) is a locally compact\ngroupoid G together with a Hausdorff locally compact space T and a continuous\n7\n\n\fopen map p : G \u2192 T such that p = p \u25e6 r = p \u25e6 s.\nAs a consequence of this definition, for any t \u2208 T , the set p\u22121 ({t}) is a closed\nsubgroupoid of G, namely the reduction of G to the saturated closed subset\np\u22121 ({t}) \u2229 G (0) , as defined in [21, Definition 1.4, p.8]. We shall denote this\ngroupoid by G[t]. It is locally compact, and it inherits by restriction a left\nHaar system from any left Haar system on G. In our previous paragraph, we\ne p, N).\nencountered two such continuous fields of groupoids: (\u0393, r, \u03a9(0) ) and (\u0393,\n\nRamazan proves in [20, Theorem 2.4.6] (see also [15, Theorem 5.5]) that C \u2217 (G)\nis then an algebra of continuous sections for the family (C \u2217 (G[t])t\u2208T . The proof\nof this result essentially follows the layout proposed by [23] to prove lower and\nupper semicontinuity for fields of C*\u2013algebras. The key result used for both\nthose steps in the case of groupoids is the disintegration of representations of\ntwisted groupoid crossed products proven by Renault in [22, Theorem 4.1].\n\nWe will need in our work a slightly more general result:\nTheorem 2.6 Let (G, p, T ) be a continuous field of groupoid, and assume G\nis separable. Let \u03b8 be a continuous 2-cocycle on G. Let f \u2208 Cc (G), and for all\nt \u2208 T denote by f t the restriction of f to the subgroupoid G[t] := p\u22121 ({t}) and\nby \u03b8t the restriction of \u03b8 to G[t]. For any C*-algebra A, we denote the norm\nof A by k.kA .\nt 7\u2212\u2192 f t\nt 7\u2212\u2192 f t\n\nC \u2217 (G[t],\u03b8t )\n\u2217 (G[t],\u03b8 )\nCred\nt\n\nis upper semicontinuous over T ,\nis lower semicontinuous over T .\n\nIn particular, when G is amenable we conclude that t 7\u2192 kf t kC \u2217 (G[t],\u03b8t ) is continuous over T , hence:\nCorollary 2.7 C \u2217 (G, \u03b8) provides a continuous structure for the field of C*\u2013\nalgebras (C \u2217 (G[t], \u03b8t ))t\u2208T when G is an amenable locally compact groupoid.\nThe complete proof of these results can be found in [16], but since it follows\nessentially well-known techniques already used in [20, Theorem 2.4.6], we shall\nomit it here. The remark which allows us to generalize [20, Theorem 2.4.6]\nto our situation is simply that, if U is a saturated subset of G (0) , then the\nrestricted groupoid GU satisfy the property that if x \u2208 GU and y \u2208 G then\n(x, y) \u2208 G (2) or (y, x) \u2208 G (2) if, and only if y \u2208 GU and either (x, y) or (y, x)\n(2)\nare in GU . Therefore, the restriction of the continuous 2-cocycle \u03b8 to GU is a\ncontinuous 2-cocycle of GU . From this, the argument in [20] works just as well\nin our setting to prove Theorem (2.6). The key observation is the following\nexact sequence:\n8\n\n\fProposition 2.8 Let G be a separable locally compact groupoid. Let U be a\nsaturated open subset of G (0) and let \u03b8 be a continuous 2-cocycle of G. Let F\nbe the complement of U in G (0) , and let GU (resp. GF ) be the reduced groupoid\nfrom G to U (resp. F ). Then the following sequence is exact:\n0 \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 (GU , \u03b8U ) \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 (G, \u03b8) \u2212\u2192 C \u2217 (GF , \u03b8F ) \u2212\u2192 0\nwhere \u03b8U (resp. \u03b8F ) is the 2-cocycle of GU (resp. GF ) obtained by restriction\nof \u03b8.\nThis proposition was originally proven in [21] for r-discrete groupoids and\nthen mentioned in a more general setting in [13]. In [20], Proposition (2.8)\nwas proven for \u03b8 = 1, and the proof carries along immediately to the twisted\ncase by using the full force of [22, Theorem 4.1] (see [16, Part 1]). The proof\nof the upper semicontinuity in Theorem (2.6) follows from Proposition (2.8)\nby observing that p\u22121 ({t}) \u2229 G (0) is a saturated closed subset of G (0) for all\nt \u2208 T . The lower semicontinuity relies on explicitly writing a family of well\nchosen \u03b8-representations of G, as detailed in [16] and [20] (for \u03b8 = 1).\nNow, let us introduce the 2-cocycle \u03b3 of \u0393 by setting:\n\u03b3 ((n, \u03c3, \u03c7), (n, \u03c3, \u03c7\u2032 )) = \u03c3(\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 ),\nfor all ((n, \u03c3, \u03c7), (n, \u03c3, \u03c7\u2032 )) \u2208 \u0393(2) . It is straightforward to check that \u03b3 is a\n2-cocycle on \u0393. It remains to prove that \u03b3 is continuous. Note that \u03b3 lifts\nnaturally to an (algebraic) 2-cocycle of \u03a9, and \u03b3 is continuous on \u0393 if and\nonly if its lift to \u03a9 is continuous since the canonical surjection is open. Let us\nsimply denote the lift of \u03b3 to \u03a9 by \u03b3 again. Since \u03a9 is metrizable, it is enough\nto prove that \u03b3 is sequentially continuous. Let ((nj , \u03b2j , \u03c7j ), (nj , \u03b2j , \u03c7\u2032j ))j\u2208N be a\nb is discrete,\nsequence in \u03a9(2) converging to ((n, \u03b2, \u03c7), (n, \u03b2, \u03c7\u2032)) in \u03a9(2) . Since G\nthere exists N \u2208 N such that for all j \u2265 N we have \u0010(\u03c7j\u0011, \u03c7\u2032,j ) = (\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 ).\nb , we then have\nOn the other hand, by definition of the topology on A G\nlimj\u2192\u221e \u03b2j (\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 ) = \u03b2(\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 ). Hence \u03b3((nj , \u03b2j , \u03c7j ), (nj , \u03b2j , \u03c7\u2032j ))j\u2208N converges to\n\u03b3((n, \u03b2, \u03c7), (n, \u03b2, \u03c7\u2032)) and \u03b3 is continuous.\n\nWe shall denote by ((At : t \u2208 T ), B) the continuous field of C*-algebras with\nparameter space T , where the continuous structure of the family (At )t\u2208T of\nC*-algebras is given by the C*-algebra B of continuous sections of (At )t\u2208T , as\ndefined in [6, Definition 10.3.1, p. 194]. Since \u0393 is amenable and separable by\nLemma (2.3), and we have proven that \u03b3 is a continuous 2-cocycle of \u0393, we\nhave by Corollary (2.7):\nCorollary 2.9\nof C*\u2013algebras.\n\n\u0010\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\nd , \u03c3 : (n, \u03c3) \u2208 \u0393(0) , C \u2217 (\u0393, \u03b3) is a continuous field\nC\u2217 H\nn\n\n9\n\n\fAlso, in exactly the same fashion, we can apply Corollary (2.7) to the bundle\ne\nof transformation groupoids \u0393:\nCorollary 2.10\nC*-algebras.\n\n3\n\n\u0010\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010 \u0011\u0011\n\nd \u00d7 X : n \u2208 N , C\u2217 \u0393\ne\nC\u2217 H\nn\nn\n\u03b1n\n\nis a continuous field of\n\nQuantum Gromov-Hausdorff convergence\n\n3.1 Finite dimensional Approximations\nWe denote by \u03bbn the Haar probability measure on Hn for all n \u2208 N, and\nwe denote by k.kL1 the norm of L1 (Hn , \u03bbn ).

We now have reduced our problem to proving that the family of finite dimensional quantum metric spaces\n(\u03b8n (V\u03b5 ), Ln )n\u2208{N\u03b5 ,N\u03b5 +1,...,\u221e} forms a continuous field of compact quantum metric spaces. The method is similar to the one in [27], yet it is adapted to the\nfact we are dealing here with many groups rather than just one.\nThe first observation is a direct consequence of the first part of our paper:\nLemma 3.9 Let a \u2208 V\u03b5 . The function n \u2208 N 7\u2192 k\u03b8n (a)kn is continuous (at\ninfinity).\n16\n\n\fPROOF. Let a \u2208 V\u03b5 . We define f \u2208 Cc (\u0393) as follows. Let (n, \u03c3, \u03c7) \u2208 \u0393. If\nn < N\u03b5 we set f (n, \u03c3, \u03c7) = 0. Assume now that n \u2265 N\u03b5 . We denote by qn the\nb \u2192H\nd . If \u03c7 6\u2208 q (supp(\u03c6\nc\u03b5 )) then we set f (n, \u03c3, \u03c7) = 0.\ncanonical surjection G\nn\nn\nb such that q (\u03c7\u2032 ) = \u03c7\nc\u03b5 )) then there exists a unique \u03c7\u2032 \u2208 G\nIf \u03c7 \u2208 qn (supp(\u03c6\nn\n\u2032\nby corollary (3.5). We set f (n, \u03c3, \u03c7) = a(\u03c7 ). The function f is continuous by\nconstruction.\nc\u03b5 ) which is compact as\nThe support of f is contained in the set \u0393(0) \u00d7 supp(\u03c6\nc\u03b5 ) is finite and \u0393(0) is compact by construction. Therefore, f defines an\nsupp(\u03c6\nelement in C \u2217 (\u0393, \u03b3). By Corollary (2.9), n 7\u2212\u2192 f (n,\u03c3n ) is continuous on N\nn\n(since we assumed that limn\u2192\u221e \u03c3n = \u03c3\u221e ).\n\nFor n \u2265 N\u03b5 , by choosing in Proposition (3.8) the map \u03b8n to be the restriction\nof the map \u0398n , it is immediate that f (n, \u03c3, \u03c7) = \u03b8n (a)(\u03c7) for n \u2265 N\u03b5 . We\ntherefore deduce that f (n,\u03c3n ) = \u03b8n (a) and our lemma is proven. \u2737\n\nNow, we turn to the continuity of the Lip-norms. For all a \u2208 V\u03b5 and g \u2208 G\\{e},\ng\nwe set \u2206g (a) = l(g)\u22121 (\u03b1G\n(a) \u2212 a).\nObserve\nthat \u2206g (a) \u2208 V\u03b5 as \u03b1G orestricts to an action on V\u03b5 , so Ln (\u03b8n (a)) =\nn\nd ), and so \u03b8 (\u03b1g (a)) =\nsup k\u03b8n (\u2206g (a))kn : g \u2208 Hn \\{e} since \u03b8n (a) \u2208 Cc (H\nn\nn\nG\ng\n\u03b1H\n(\u03b8\n(a))\nfor\nany\ng\n\u2208\nH\nfor\nour\nchoice\nof\n\u03b8\n=\n\u0398\non\nV\n.\nn\nn\nn\nn\n\u03b5\nn\nFor a \u2208 V\u03b5 , the function n \u2208 N 7\u2192 k\u03b8n (a)kn is continuous on the compact\nN\\{0, 1, . . . , N\u03b5 \u2212 1} by Lemma (3.9), so it is bounded and so we can define\nkak\u2217 = supn\u2208N\\{0,1,...,N\u03b5 \u22121} k\u03b8n (a)kn . It is straightforward to check that k.k\u2217 is\na norm on V\u03b5 .\nProposition 3.10 Let a \u2208 V\u03b5 . The function n \u2208 N 7\u2192 Ln (\u03b8n (a)) is continuous\n(at infinity).\n\nPROOF. Let \u03b5 > 0 and a \u2208 V\u03b5 . There exists g\u03b5 \u2208 G\\{e} such that L\u221e (a) \u2212\n\u03b5 \u2264 k\u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u221e \u2264 L\u221e (a). Now, the function g 7\u2192 \u2206g (a) is continuous at g\u03b5 \u2208 G\nfor the norm k.k\u2217 . Indeed, the dual action \u03b1G is continuous on (V\u03b5 , k.k\u221e ), and\nsince V\u03b5 is finite dimensional, all the norms on V\u03b5 are equivalent. Moreover,\nby assumption l is continuous and l(g) = 0 only when g = e, so the function\ng \u2208 G\\{e} 7\u2192 l(g)\u22121 is continuous as well.\nTherefore, we can find \u03b4 > 0 such that, for all g \u2208 G such that l(g\u03b5 g \u22121) \u2264 \u03b4,\nwe have:\nk\u2206g (a) \u2212 \u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u2217 \u2264 \u03b5\nby continuity of g \u2208 G\\{e} 7\u2192 \u2206g (a) for k.k\u2217 at g\u03b5 .\n17\n\n\fAlso, by Lemma (3.9), we can choose N \u2208 N so that for all n \u2265 N:\nk\u03b8n (\u2206g\u03b5 (a))kn \u2212 k\u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u221e \u2264 \u03b5.\nOn the other hand, since (Hn )n\u2208N converges for the Hausdorff distance H(l)\nto G, there exists N \u2032 \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 N \u2032 , any point in G is within\nan \u03b4-ball whose center is in Hn . In particular, we can find, for all n \u2265 N \u2032 , an\nelement gn \u2208 Hn such that l(g\u03b5 gn\u22121 ) \u2264 \u03b4. We let N \u2032\u2032 = max(N, N \u2032 ).\nWe can now compute, for all n \u2265 N \u2032\u2032 :\nk\u03b8n (\u2206gn (a))kn \u2212 k\u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u221e \u2264 k\u03b8n (\u2206gn (a))kn \u2212 k\u03b8n (\u2206g\u03b5 (a))kn\n+ k\u03b8n (\u2206g\u03b5 (a))kn \u2212 k\u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u221e\n\u2264 k\u03b8n (\u2206gn (a) \u2212 \u2206g\u03b5 (a))kn + \u03b5\n\u2264 k\u2206gn (a) \u2212 \u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u2217 + \u03b5 \u2264 2\u03b5\nwhere we used that \u03b8n is a linear map of norm 1 as the restriction of \u0398n by\nProposition (3.8). Now we can conclude that, for n \u2265 N \u2032\u2032 :\nLn (\u03b8n (a)) \u2265 k\u03b8n (\u2206gn (a))kn \u2265 k\u2206g\u03b5 (a)k\u221e \u2212 2\u03b5 \u2265 L\u221e (a) \u2212 3\u03b5.\nHence lim inf n\u2192\u221e Ln (\u03b8n (a)) \u2265 L\u221e (a).\nOn the other hand, it is obvious that Ln (\u03b8n (a)) \u2264 L\u2032n (a) where L\u2032n (a) =\nsup{k\u03b8n (\u2206g (a))kn : g \u2208 G\\{e}}. Yet, we are now in the setting of [27, Lemma\n9.3]: we have a continuous field of norms on a finite dimensional vector space,\nand we define the Lip-norms L\u2032n as the supremum, for each of those norms,\nof the same sets (because now we only deal with one group, G). We therefore\nomit this part and we refer the reader to [27, Lemma 9.3] or [16] for the\ndetails. \u2737\n\nIn fact, we have proven a little more. Let (Hn\u2032 )n\u2208N be a sequence of closed\nsubgroups of G such that Hn \u2286 Hn\u2032 for all n \u2208 N. We can define a sequence of\nLip-norms\nn\n\no\n\nLHn\u2032 : a \u2208 V\u03b5 7\u2212\u2192 sup k\u03b8n (\u2206g (a))kn : g \u2208 Hn\u2032 \\{e} .\n\n(3.5)\n\nOf course, the sequence (Hn\u2032 )n\u2208N of closed subspaces of G converge to G for\n\u2032\n\u2032 = L\u221e .\nH(l), so we set H\u221e\n= G. We observe, with obvious notations, that LH\u221e\n\u2032\nThen the simple observation Ln \u2264 LHn\u2032 \u2264 Ln lead to the following:\nCorollary 3.11 For all a \u2208 V\u03b5 we have limn\u2192\u221e LHn\u2032 (a) = L\u221e (a).\nWe can now conclude this section, by using [27, Lemma 9.3]:\n18\n\n\fCorollary 3.12 We have:\nlim distq ((\u03b8n (V\u03b5 ), Ln ) , (V\u03b5 , L\u221e )) = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n3.3 Main Theorem\nWe can now conclude this section with our main theorem, which is now an\nimmediate consequence of Proposition (3.8) and Corollary (3.12):\nTheorem 3.13 Let G be a compact Abelian group endowed with a continuous\nlength function l.

There exists a sequence (An , Ln )n\u2208N\nof compact quantum metric spaces such that for all n \u2208 N we have An is a full\nmatrix algebra, and\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\nlim distq (An , Ln ) , C(Td ), L\u221e\n\nn\u21920\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\n= 0.\n\nPROOF. Set \u03c80 = . . . = \u03c8d/2\u22121 = 0 in Proposition (3.14). \u2737\nCorollary 3.16 Let d = 2. Then for any \u03c3 \u2208 A(Z2 ), there exists a sequence\n(An , Ln )n\u2208N of compact quantum metric spaces such that for all n \u2208 N we have\nAn is a full matrix algebra, and\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\nlim distq (An , Ln ) , C(Z2 , \u03c3), L\u221e\n\nn\u21920\n\n\u0011\u0011\n\n= 0.\n\nPROOF. All skew bicharacters of Z2 are of the form \u03c3[\u03c8\u039b] for some \u03c8 \u2208\n[0, 1[. We conclude by applying Proposition (3.14). \u2737\n\nWe invite the interested reader to compare our construction in Corollary (3.16)\nand Proposition (3.14) to the construction in [19], where a sequence of direct\nsums of two full matrix algebras has an inductive limit which is an AF algebra\nin which C \u2217 (Z2 , \u03c3) embeds. This construction can also be found in [5, Secs.\nVI.3-VI.5, pp. 172-180]. The reader may check that each summand in these\nfinite dimensional algebras converge to C \u2217 (Z2 , \u03c3) for distq by Theorem (3.13).\nWe will return to the problem of approximating the tori of odd dimension by\nfull matrix algebras in the next section.\n\n4\n\nVarying Length Functions and Dimensional Collapse\n\nWe adopt a different framework in this section. We let G be a compact group\nwith unit e, and A be a unital C*-algebra whose norm is denoted by k.kA . We\nassume given a strongly continuous ergodic action \u03b1 of G on A. The group G\nis not necessarily Abelian, nor a Lie group.\nWe let (ln )n\u2208N be a sequence of continuous length functions on G. We wish\nto deal with the more general case when the limit of a sequence of length\nfunctions is not a length function on G, but factors into a continuous length\nfunction on a quotient of G. Let H be a normal subgroup of G and K = G\\H.\n21\n\n\fBy [11, Theorem 5.26, p. 40], the space K is a topological group, and the\ncanonical surjection g \u2208 G 7\u2192 [g] \u2208 K is continuous, so K is compact.\nNow, we suppose that the sequence (ln )n\u2208N converges uniformly on G to a\nfunction lf\n\u221e such that:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 lf\n\u221e (g)\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 lf (g)\n\u221e\n\n= 0 for g \u2208 H,\n\n(4.1)\n\n> 0 for g 6\u2208 H.\n\nLemma 4.1 If the sequence (ln )n\u2208N satisfies the conditions (4.1), then there\nexists a continuous length function l\u221e on K such that ln (g) \u2212\u2192 l\u221e ([g]) for\nn\u2192\u221e\nall g \u2208 G.\n\nPROOF. Since ln is a length function on G for all n \u2208 N, we have that\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf\nf \u2032\nf \u22121\nf\nlf\n\u221e (gg ) \u2264 l\u221e (g) + l\u221e (g ) and l\u221e (g ) = l\u221e (g) for all g, g \u2208 G by taking the\n\u2032\npointwise limit. Let g \u2208 G and g \u2208 H. We observe that\n\u0010\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf\nf\nlf\n\u221e (g) \u2264 l\u221e (gg ) + l\u221e (g )\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u2032\n= lf\n\u221e (gg )\n\nf \u2032\nf\n\u2264 lf\n\u221e (g) + l\u221e (g ) = l\u221e (g)\n\u0011\n\n\u2032\n\u2032 \u22121\nf\n= 0 because g \u2032 \u2208 H and (4.1) holds by assumpsince lf\n\u221e (g ) = l\u221e (g )\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf\ntion. We thus have shown that lf\n\u221e (g) = l\u221e (gg ) for all g \u2208 H. We can thus\ndefine a function l\u221e on K by setting l\u221e ([g]) = lf\n\u221e (g), and by construction\n\u2032\nlimn\u2192\u221e ln (g) = l\u221e ([g]). We have, for all g, g \u2208 G:\n\u2032\n\u2032\nf\nf \u2032\nl\u221e ([g][g]\u2032) = lf\n\u221e (gg ) \u2264 l\u221e (g) + l\u221e (g ) = l\u221e ([g]) + l\u221e ([g ]),\n\nand similarly l\u221e ([g]\u22121 ) = l\u221e ([g]). Moreover, l\u221e ([g]) = 0 if and only if lf\n\u221e (g) =\n0, which is equivalent by (4.1) to g \u2208 H. Hence l\u221e ([g]) = 0 if and only if [g]\nis the identity [e] of K. Therefore l\u221e is a length function on K. It remains to\nprove that l\u221e is continuous. Now, the canonical surjection g \u2208 G 7\u2192 [g] \u2208 K is\ncontinuous and open by [11, Theorem 5.17, p. 37]. Therefore, l\u221e is continuous\non K = [G] if and only if g 7\u2192 l\u221e \u25e6 [g] is continuous on G. Yet by construction\ng 7\u2192 l\u221e \u25e6 [g] is lf\n\u221e , which is continuous on G, since it is the uniform limit\nof the sequence (ln )n\u2208N of continuous (length) functions. This concludes our\nlemma. \u2737\n\nRemark 4.2 We observe that, without assuming (4.1), the zero set of the\npointwise limit lf\n\u221e of the sequence (ln )n\u2208N of continuous length functions on\nG is always a group. It is also straightforward that this group is normal if\nthere exists some N \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 N, the length functions ln are\ninvariant by the inner automorphisms of G. If moreover the sequence (ln )n\u2208N\n22\n\n\fconverges uniformly, we can set H to be this normal subgroup of G and by\nconstruction the hypotheses of Lemma (4.1) are then satisfied.\nFor each n \u2208 N, we define on K the quotient length functions lnK by setting\nfor all g \u2208 G:\nlnK ([g]) = inf {ln (g \u2032 ) : g \u2032 \u2208 G, [g] = [g \u2032]} .\nThe following lemma will be useful:\nLemma 4.3 For each n \u2208 N, the length function lnK is continuous on K.\nMoreover, the sequence (lnK )n\u2208N converges uniformly on K to l\u221e .\nPROOF. Let n \u2208 N. By definition, we have for all [g] \u2208 K:\nlnK ([g]) = inf {ln (gh) : h \u2208 H} .\nNow, since ln is a length function, we have for all h \u2208 H and g \u2032 \u2208 G:\n|ln (gh) \u2212 ln (g \u2032h)| \u2264 ln (g \u22121g \u2032 )\nand so the family of functions (g 7\u2192 ln (gh))h\u2208H is equicontinuous on the compact G. Their infimum is therefore continuous as well, so g \u2208 G 7\u2192 lnK ([g]) is\ncontinuous. Since g \u2208 G 7\u2192 [g] \u2208 K is a continuous open surjection, we deduce\nthat lnK is continuous on K.\nNow let us fix g \u2208 G. Since H is compact and h 7\u2192 ln (gh) is continuous on H,\nthere exists hn \u2208 H such that inf {ln (gh) : h \u2208 H} = ln (ghn ). We then have\nlnK ([g]) \u2212 l\u221e ([g]) = ln (ghn ) \u2212 lf\n\u221e (ghn ) since we have shown in Lemma (4.1)\nthat lf\n\u221e is constant on the coset gH in G. Therefore:\n\nsup lnK ([g]) \u2212 l\u221e ([g]) \u2264 sup ln (g) \u2212 lf\n\u221e (g) .\n\n(4.2)\n\ng\u2208G\n\n[g]\u2208K\n\nK\nBy definition, lf\n\u221e is the uniform limit on G of the sequence (ln )n\u2208N so (ln )n\u2208N\nconverges uniformly on K to l\u221e by (4.2). \u2737\n\nWe recall that, given an ergodic strongly continuous action \u03b1 of any compact\ngroup \u03a3 of unit e with a length function \u03c1 on a unital C*-algebra A of norm\nk.kA , Rieffel proved in [24] that the seminorm defined for all a \u2208 A by\nn\n\nL(a) = sup \u03c1(g)\u22121 ka \u2212 \u03b1g (a)k : g \u2208 \u03a3\\{e}\nis a Lip-norm on A.\n\nWe are now ready to prove the main result of this section:\n23\n\no\n\n(4.3)\n\n\fTheorem 4.4 Let AK be the fixed-point C*-algebra of the action \u03b1 restricted\nto H. Let (ln )n\u2208N be a sequence of continuous length functions on G satisfying\nthe conditions (4.1). Moreover, we assume that\n\nlim\n\nsup\n\nn\u2192\u221e [g]\u2208K\\{[e]}\n\nl\u221e ([g])\n\u22121 =0\nlnK ([g])\n\n(4.4)\n\nand that for all n \u2208 N we have ln (g \u22121 g \u2032g) = l(g \u2032 ) for all g, g \u2032 \u2208 G.\nFor all n \u2208 N we define on A the Lip-norm L[n] from \u03b1 and ln as in (4.3).\nNow, let \u03b1K be the quotient action of K on AK induced by \u03b1. The action \u03b1K is\nstrongly continuous and ergodic. We can therefore define the Lip norm L[\u221e]\non AK obtained from the action \u03b1K of K on AK and the continuous length\nfunction l\u221e of Lemma (4.1). We have:\nlim distq ((A, L[n]) , (AK , L[\u221e])) = 0.\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nPROOF. We start by remarking that \u03b1 is a strongly continuous ergodic\naction on AK which coincides with an action \u03b1K of K on AK . Indeed, let\na \u2208 AK , g \u2208 G and h \u2208 H. Then \u03b1gh (a) = \u03b1g (\u03b1h (a)) but by definition of AK\nK\nwe have \u03b1h (a) = a. Hence we can define \u03b1[g]\n(a) by \u03b1g (a) for any g \u2208 G and\nfor all a \u2208 AK , where as usual [g] is the class of g in K. Moreover we have:\nK\n(a)) = \u03b1hg (a) = \u03b1g (\u03b1g\u22121 hg (a))\n\u03b1h (\u03b1[g]\nK\n= \u03b1g (a) = \u03b1[g]\n(a),\n\nsince h \u2208 H and so g \u22121 hg \u2208 H since H is a normal subgroup of G. Therefore,\nK\nsince h \u2208 H was chosen arbitrarily, \u03b1[g]\n(a) \u2208 AK by definition. Hence, \u03b1K is\nan action of K on AK . Since \u03b1 is ergodic, so is \u03b1K . Since g \u2208 G 7\u2192 [g] \u2208 K\nis a continuous open surjection of G onto K, the strong continuity of \u03b1 on G\nimplies the strong continuity of \u03b1K on K.\nThus, the action \u03b1K and the continuous length function l\u221e indeed define a\nLip-norm L[\u221e] on AK by setting, for all a \u2208 AK :\n\nL[\u221e](a) = sup\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\nK\na \u2212 \u03b1[g]\n(a)\n\nl\u221e ([g])\n24\n\nA\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n: [g] \u2208 K\\{[e]} .\n\uf8fe\n\n\fNow we also observe that for all n \u2208 N, and most importantly for all a \u2208 AK :\n(\n\nka \u2212 \u03b1g (a)kA\nL[n](a) = sup\n: g \u2208 G\\{e}\nln (g)\n= sup\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\nK\na \u2212 \u03b1[g]\n(a)\n\n\uf8f3\n\nA\n\n)\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n: [g] \u2208 K\\{[e]} .\n\uf8fe\n\nlnK ([g])\n\n(4.5)\n\nIn other words, for each n \u2208 N, the restriction of L[n] to AK agrees with the\nLip-norm LK [n] obtained from the action \u03b1K of K and the continuous length\nfunction lnK of K. We shall only use the notation L[n]. Also, we observe that\nfor any n \u2208 N, the Lip-norm L[n] is the supremum of a family of continuous\nfunctions on A, so it is lower-semicontinuous on A. Similarly, L[\u221e] is lowersemicontinuous on AK .\nWe now turn to the main argument of our theorem. We define the conditional\nexpectation E on A by setting for all a \u2208 A:\nE(a) =\n\nZ\n\nh\u2208H\n\n\u03b1h (a)d\u03bbH (h)\n\nwhere \u03bbH is the Haar probability measure on H. A standard argument shows\nthat E is indeed a conditional expectation whose range is the fixed point\nC*\u2013algebra AK of the action \u03b1 restricted to H. Now, we can compute:\nka \u2212 E(a)kA =\n\u2264\n\nZ\n\nH\n\nZ\n\nH\n\n(a \u2212 \u03b1h (a)) d\u03bbH (h)\n\n\u2264\nA\n\nZ\n\nH\n\nka \u2212 \u03b1h (a)kA d\u03bbH (h)\n\nL[n](a)ln (h)d\u03bbH (h) = L[n](a)\n\nZ\n\nH\n\nln (h)d\u03bbH (h)\n\n(4.6)\n\nfor all n \u2208 N. We used in the first equality the fact that \u03bbH is a probability\nmeasure.\nLet \u03b5 > 0 be given. RNow, by assumption, (ln )n\u2208N converges uniformly to 0\non H, hence limn\u2192\u221e H ln (h)d\u03bb\n(h) = 0. Therefore there exists N0 \u2208 N such\nR H\nthat for all n \u2265 N0 we have H ln (h)d\u03bbH (h) \u2264 41 \u03b5. Hence by (4.6) we have:\n1\nka \u2212 E(a)kA \u2264 \u03b5L[n](a).\n4\n\n(4.7)\n\nSince L[n] is a lower semicontinuous seminorm, we have that\nL[n]\n\n\u0012Z\n\nH\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1h (a)d\u03bbH (h) \u2264\n\nZ\n\nH\n\nL[n](\u03b1h (a))d\u03bbH (h).\n\nNow we have that L[n](\u03b1h (a)) = L[n](a) since the inner automorphisms of G\n25\n\n\fpreserve ln . Hence we have:\nL[n]\n\n\u0012Z\n\nH\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03b1h (a)d\u03bbH (h) \u2264\n\n\u0012Z\n\nH\n\n\u0013\n\nd\u03bbH L[n](a) = L[n](a)\n\nas \u03bbH is a probability measure on H. In other words, for all a \u2208 A we have:\nL[n](E(a)) \u2264 L[n](a).\n\n(4.8)\n\nHence, using [27, Proposition 8.5] with (4.7) and (4.8), we have, for all n \u2265 N0 :\n1\ndistq ((A, L[n]) , (AK , L[n])) \u2264 \u03b5.\n4\n\n(4.9)\n\nWe now use a similar method to that of the proof of Proposition (3.8). Let us\nendow K with its unique probability Haar measure \u03bbK . For any\np \u2208 N\\{0}, we\nR\ndenote by \u03c6p the function given by Lemma (3.1) such that G l\u221e \u03c6p d\u03bb < p\u22121 .\nLet p \u2208 N\\{0} such that\nZ\n\n1\nl\u221e (g)\u03c6p (g)d\u03bbK (g) \u2264 \u03b5.\n8\nK\n\n(4.10)\n\nWe define the operator \u03b1\u03c6Kp on AK by setting, for all a \u2208 AK :\n\u03b1\u03c6Kp (a)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nK\n\n\u03c6p (g)\u03b1gK\u22121 (a)d\u03bbK (g).\n\nWe denote by Vp the image by \u03b1\u03c6Kp of the self-adjoint part of AK . It is an easy\ncorollary of [27, sec. 8, pp. 37\u201339] that Vp is an finite dimensional order-unit\nsubspace of AK such that L[\u221e](a) < \u221e for all a \u2208 Vp (specifically, AK is the\ndirect sum of the isotopic components of A for the irreducible representations\nwhose characters appear in \u03c6p ). Now, as in the proof of Proposition (3.8), we\nhave, for all n \u2208 N:\na \u2212 \u03b1\u03c6Kp (a)\n\nA\n\n\u2264\n\n\u0012Z\n\nK\n\n\u0013\n\nlnK (g)\u03c6p(g)d\u03bbK (g) L[n](a),\n\n(4.11)\n\nK\nwhere we \u0010denoted\nl\u221e by l\u221e\nto ease notations. Now, by Lemma (4.3), the\n\u0011\nK\nsequence ln\nconverges uniformly to l\u221e on K. Therefore, there exists\nn\u2208N\nN1 \u2208 N such that, for all n \u2265 N1 we have:\n\nZ\n\n1\nlnK (g)\u03c6p(g)d\u03bbK (g) \u2264 \u03b5\n4\nK\n\n(4.12)\n\nusing (4.10). We conclude from (4.11) and (4.12) that for all a \u2208 AK and all\nn \u2208 N such that n \u2265 N1 we have:\na \u2212 \u03b1\u03c6Kp (a)\n\nA\n\n26\n\n1\n\u2264 \u03b5L[n](a).\n4\n\n(4.13)\n\n\fOf course, with the same argument as used in the proof of Proposition (3.8)\nand also used to deduce (4.8), we have, for all n \u2208 N such that n \u2265 N1 and\nfor all a \u2208 AK :\n(4.14)\nL[n](\u03b1\u03c6Kp (a)) \u2264 L[n](a).\nBy construction, the range of \u03b1\u03c6Kp restricted to the self-adjoint part of AK is\nthe order-unit subspace Vp of AK .

Hence limn\u2192\u221e L[n](a) = L[\u221e](a).\nSummarizing, on the finite dimensional order-unit space Vp we have a continuous field of Lip-norms (L[n])n\u2208N , and so by [27, theorem 11.2] we conclude\nthere exists N3 \u2208 N such that for all n \u2265 N3 we have:\n1\ndistq ((Vp , L[n]) , (Vp , L[\u221e])) \u2264 \u03b5.\n4\n\n(4.16)\n\nHence by the triangle inequality, using (4.15) and (4.16), we have for all n \u2265\nmax{N1 , N3 }:\n3\ndistq (((AK , L[n])) , ((AK , L[\u221e]))) \u2264 \u03b5.\n4\n27\n\n(4.17)\n\n\fBy the triangle inequality, using (4.17) and (4.9), we conclude that for all\nn \u2265 N4 where N4 = max{N0 , N1, N3 }:\ndistq (((A, L[n])) , ((AK , L[\u221e]))) \u2264 \u03b5.\nThis concludes the proof of this Theorem. \u2737\nRemark 4.5 By Lemma (4.3), for each n \u2208 N the length function lnK is\ncontinuous on K, so it can be used to define a Lip-norm LK [n] on AK via the\nstrongly continuous ergodic action \u03b1K . The proof of Theorem (4.4) shows in\nparticular that the field of Lip-norms n \u2208 N 7\u2192 LK [n] (where LK [\u221e] = L[\u221e])\nis continuous on AK .\nWe obtain in particular the following corollary, when H = {e}:\nCorollary 4.6 Let (ln )n\u2208N be a sequence of continuous length functions on G\nuniformly converging on G to a function l\u221e , such that\nlim\n\nsup\n\nn\u2192\u221e g\u2208G\\{e}\n\nl\u221e (g)\n\u22121 = 0\nln (g)\n\nand l\u221e (g) = 0 only if g = e. Then l\u221e is a continuous length function on G. If\nwe denote by L[n] the Lip-norm defined on A by \u03b1 and ln for all n \u2208 N then\nlim distq ((A, L[n]) , (A, L[\u221e])) = 0\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nPROOF. Setting H = {e}, we can first use Lemma (4.1) to conclude that\nl\u221e is indeed a continuous length function on K = G. Then we simply apply\nTheorem (4.4) to complete the proof of our corollary. \u2737\n\nTheorem (4.4) is not vacuous, as there exists sequences of continuous length\nfunctions satisfying its hypotheses. We now focus on our fundamental example\n(1.4). The following easy lemma proposes a construction of such sequences\nd\nwhen G = Udk and H = {1} \u00d7 Ud\u2212\u03b4\nk \u2032\u2032 for any k \u2208 N , any \u03b4 \u2208 {0, . . . , d}, and\nwhere k \u2032\u2032 \u2208 Nd\u2212\u03b4 and k \u2032 \u2208 N\u03b4 are uniquely defined by k = (k \u2032 , k \u2032\u2032 ). With these\nnotations, K = U\u03b4k\u2032 . Observe that we can also write Udk = U\u03b4k\u2032 \u00d7 Ud\u2212\u03b4\nk \u2032\u2032 . We\nhave:\nLemma 4.7 Let l be a continuous length function on Udk . We set, for n \u2208 N:\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n1\nln (\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) =\nl(\u03c91 , 1)\nl(\u03c91 , \u03c92) + 1 \u2212\nn+1\nn+1\n28\n\n\fwhere \u03c91 \u2208 U\u03b4k\u2032 and \u03c92 \u2208 Ud\u2212\u03b4\nk \u2032\u2032 . Then the sequence (ln )n\u2208N satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem (4.4), namely (4.1) and (4.4).Moreover the length function\nl\u221e on U\u03b4k\u2032 is given by \u03c9 \u2208 U\u03b4k\u2032 7\u2212\u2192 l(\u03c9, 1).\nPROOF. This proof is straightforward. We refer to [16]. \u2737\nAn interesting remark is that we can use Theorem (4.4) together with Lemma\n(4.7) to prove that there exist sequences of quantum tori converging for distq\nto a circle (\u03b4 = 1) or even a point (\u03b4 = 0).\n\nNow, we have the following obvious corollary from Theorem (4.4) and Proposition (3.14):\nCorollary 4.8 Let d \u2208 2N + 1. There exists a sequence (An , LAn )n\u2208N of\ncompact quantum metric spaces, where An is a full matrix algebra\nfor each\n\u0010\n\u0011\nd\nn \u2208 N, such that (An , LAn )n\u2208N converges to the ordinary torus C(T ), L\u221e =\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nC \u2217 (Zd ), L\u221e for distq .\n\nPROOF. This is a simple diagonal argument. Let n \u2208 N. Let lm be given as\nin Lemma (4.7) for any m \u2208 N. By Proposition (3.14) there exists a prime\nnumber qn,m and a skew bicharacter \u03c3n,m of Zd+1\n(qn,m ,...,qn,m ) such that An,m =\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nC \u2217 Zd+1\n(qn,m ,...,qn,m ) , \u03c3n,m is a full matrix algebra and\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndistq (An,m , LAn,m ), (C(Td+1 ), L[lm ]) \u2264 (2n)\u22121\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nwhere LAn,m is the lip-norm defined on C \u2217 Zd+1\n(qn,m ,...,qn,m ) , \u03c3n,m by the dual\nd+1\naction of U(qn,m ,...,qn,m ) and the length lm . Now, using Theorem (4.4), we can\npick m large enough so that\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndistq (C(Td ), L[l]), (C(Td+1 ), L[lm ]) \u2264 (2n)\u22121 .\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nHence for this m we have distq (An,m , LAn,m ), (C(T), L[l]) \u2264 n\u22121 . \u2737\n\n5\n\nAnnex: Any compact metric space can be approximated in Gromov\u2013Hausdorff distance by matrix algebras\n\nOne could be tempted to ask the question: when is any compact metric space\nthe limit of full matrix algebras for distq ? Surprisingly, the answer is all of\n29\n\n\fthem. However, the construction we will propose is blind to any symmetry of\nthe limit space, and in particular, it does not prove our theorem (3.13) even\nwhen the limit is C \u2217 (Zd ) = C(Td ), as the Lip-norms on the matrix algebras\nare not coming from any action of a product of cyclic groups. Of course, the\nfollowing result does not tell us anything about approximations of the quantum\ntori in general.\nLet (X = {x1 , . . . , xn }, d) be a metric space of cardinality n \u2208 N whose distance d induces a Lipschitz seminorm L on C(X). Let \u03b5 > 0. Also, define the\nfollowing maps:\n\uf8ee\n\nDn : f \u2208 C(X) 7\u2212\u2192\n\n\uf8ef f (x1 )\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef .\n\uf8ef ..\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n***\n.\nf (x2 ) . .\n.. ..\n.\n.\n***\n\n0\n..\n.\n0\n\n0 f (xn )\n\nPn : A \u2208 Mn 7\u2212\u2192 (xi 7\u2192 Ai,i ) ,\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa,\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nwhere for any matrix A, the complex number Ai,j is the (i, j)th entry of A. We\nset the seminorm:\nLo,n (A) = sup |Aij | .\ni6=j\n\nWith these notations introduced, we can state our result:\nProposition 5.1 Let \u03b5 > 0 be given. Set, for n \u2265 1:\nL\u03b5 = max{L \u25e6 Pn ,\n\nn2 \u2212 n\nLo,n }.\n2\u03b5\n\nThen L\u03b5 is a Lip-norm on Mn , and moreover\ndistq ((C(X), L), (Mn , L\u03b5 )) \u2264 \u03b5.\nPROOF. Proving that a seminorm such as L\u03b5 is a Lip-norm for a finite\ndimensional algebra is a triviality, as all that is needed is that L\u03b5 (A) = 0 if,\nand only if A = \u03bb1 for some \u03bb \u2208 C. Now, if L\u03b5 (A) = 0 then Lo,n (A) = 0 so A\nis diagonal, and since L(P (A)) = 0, P (A) is a constant function, hence L\u03b5 is\na Lip-norm.\nWe now set, for f \u2208 C(X) and A \u2208 Mn :\n2\nkf \u2212 Pn (A)kC(X) ,\n\u03b5\nLN (f, A) = max{L(f ), L\u03b5 (A), N(f, A)}.\nN(f, A) =\n\n30\n\n\fN is trivially a continuous seminorm over C(X) \u2295 Mn , and we check:\nN(1, 0) = N(0, 1) =\n\n2\n\u03b5\n\nand yet N(1, 1) = 0 and, obviously,\nN(f, Dn (f )) = 0 = N(Pn (A), A).\nNow, this implies that N is a bridge for L and L\u03b5 as defined in [26], as indeed\nwe check:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 L(Pn (A)) \u2264 L\u03b5 (A)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3L\n\n\u03b5 (Dn (f ))\n\n= L(f ).\n\nIn other words, LN is a Lip-norm compatible with (C(X), L) and (Mn , L\u03b5 ).\nIt is therefore now sufficient to prove that the Hausdorff distance between\nthe state spaces of C(X) and Mn in the state space of C(X) \u2295 Mn are \u03b5close. Let (\u03bc, \u03bd) \u2208 S(C(X)) \u00d7 S(Mn ), and let (f, A) \u2208 C(X) \u2295 Mn be such\nthat LN (f, A) \u2264 1. Then by definition of N, we have kf \u2212 Pn (A)k \u2264 12 \u03b5, so,\ndefining the linear functional \u03bc \u25e6 Pn on Mn , we see that\n1\n|\u03bc(f ) \u2212 \u03bc(Pn (A))| \u2264 \u03b5.\n2\nSince Pn is a positive map and Pn maps the unit of Mn to the unit of C(X),\nthe linear map \u03bc \u25e6 Pn is a state of Mn . Thus S(C(X)) is in an \u03b5-neighborhood\nof S(Mn ) in Hausdorff distance for the dual metric of LN .\nOn the other hand, D being trivially a positive unit-preserving map, the map\n\u03bd \u25e6 D is a state of C(X), and:\n|\u03bd(D(f )) \u2212 \u03bd(A)| \u2264 |\u03bd(A \u2212 D \u25e6 P (A))| + |\u03bd(D(f ) \u2212 D \u25e6 P (A))|\n\u2264 kA \u2212 D \u25e6 P (A)k + kf \u2212 P (A)k\n1\n\u2264 (n2 \u2212 n)Lo,n (A) + \u03b5 \u2264 \u03b5.\n2\n\u2737\nCorollary 5.2 Any compact metric space (X, d) is a limit point of the space\nof full matrix algebras with Lip-norms, topologized by the quantum GromovHausdorff distance.\nPROOF. Let \u03b5 > 0. Since X is compact, there exists a finite subset X\u03b5 of X\nS\nsuch that X \u2286 x\u2208Xn B(x, \u03b5) where B(x, \u03b5) is the open ball in X of center x\nand radius \u03b5. Thus, in particular, we have that distq (C(X), C(X\u03b5 )) \u2264 \u03b5. Let\n31\n\n\fn = #X\u03b5 . There exists, by Proposition (5.1), a Lip-norm Ln on Mn such that\ndistq (C(X\u03b5 ), Mn ) \u2264 \u03b5. By the triangle inequality, we conclude the proof our\nproposition. \u2737\n\nReferences\n[1] N. Bourbaki, Int\u00e9gration, \u00c9l\u00e9ments de Math\u00e9matiques, vol.
