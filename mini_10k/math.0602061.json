INTRODUCTION\nDirected graphs provide a simple and universal tool to model connection structures. It is not\naccidental that the first systematic monograph in the theory of digraphs [1] was titled \"Structural\nModels: An Introduction to the Theory of Directed Graphs.\" Digraphs frequently serve to model\nprocesses that can proceed in the direction of arcs. Physical transference, service, control, transmission of influences, ideas, innovations, and diseases are examples of such processes. If a process\ncan start from a number of vertices and ends with the inclusion of all vertices, then the process\ncan be modelled by the family of out forests (i.e., spanning diverging forests) of the digraph. The\nenumeration of all out forests allows one to determine the typical roles of the vertices in the process:\none vertex is a typical starting point, another vertex is a typical intermediate point, some vertex\nis a typical terminating point of the process, etc. If an initial (weighted) digraph imposes some\nmeasure on the said processes, then the \"role profile\" of each vertex can be expressed numerically.\nMoreover, an exact answer can be given to the following important question: how likely is it that\nthe process initiated at vertex j arrives at vertex i. It is not surprising that out forests of a digraph\nturn out to be closely related with Markov chains realizable on the digraph.\nThe study of out forests has been started in [2]. Generally, they were given less attention in the\nliterature, than that given to spanning diverging trees (out arborescences), which exist only for a\nnarrow class of digraphs. We mention in this connection [3\u201311], where still undirected forests were\nconsidered in most cases. The maximum out forests (i.e., out forests with the greatest possible\nnumber of arcs) of a digraph were studied in [12,13]. It was established that the normalized matrix\nof such forests coincides with the matrix of limiting probabilities of every Markov chain related to\nthe given digraph. Some results on spanning forests of directed and undirected multigraphs were\ngiven in [14, 15].\n1\n\nThis work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research and INTAS.\n0005-1179/01/6203-0443$25 c 2001 MAIK \"Nauka/Interperiodica\"\n\n\f444\n\nAGAEV, CHEBOTAREV\n\nIn this paper, we study the normalized matrix of out forests (which has been also termed the\nmatrix of relative forest accessibilities and the matrix of forest proximities) and the matrices of\nforests with fixed numbers of arcs.\n2. NOTATION AND SOME EARLIER RESULTS\nIn the terminology, we mainly follow [1, 16]. Suppose that \u0393 is a weighted digraph without\nloops, V (\u0393 ) = {1, . . . , n} (n > 1) is its set of vertices, and E(\u0393 ) its set of arcs. The weights of all\narcs are supposed to be strictly positive. A subgraph of a digraph \u0393 is a digraph whose vertices\nand arcs belong to the sets of vertices and arcs of \u0393 ; the weights of subgraph's arcs are the same as\nin \u0393 . A restriction of \u0393 to V \u2032 \u2282 V (\u0393 ) is a digraph whose arc set contains all the arcs in E(\u0393 ) that\nhave both incident vertices in V \u2032 . A spanning subgraph of \u0393 is a subgraph with vertex set V (\u0393 ).\nThe indegree id(w) of vertex w is the number of arcs that come to w, outdegree od(w) of vertex w\nis the number of arcs that come from w. A vertex w will be called undominated if id(w)=0 and\ndominated if id(w) \u2265 1. A vertex w is isolated if \u0393 contains no arcs incident to w.\nA route in a digraph is an alternating sequence of vertices and arcs w0 , e1 , w1 , . . . , ek , wk with\nevery arc ei being (wi\u22121 , wi ). If every arc ei is either (wi\u22121 , wi ) or (wi , wi\u22121 ), then the sequence is\ncalled a semiroute. A path in a digraph is a route all whose vertices are different. A circuit is a\nroute with w0 = wk , the other vertices being distinct and different from w0 . A vertex w is reachable\nfrom a vertex z in \u0393 if w = z or \u0393 contains a path from z to w. A semicircuit is an alternating\nsequence of distinct vertices and arcs, w0 , e1 , w1 , . . . , ek , w0 , where every arc ei is either (wi\u22121 , wi )\nor (wi , wi\u22121 ) and all vertices w0 , . . . , wk\u22121 are different. The restriction of \u0393 to any maximal subset\nof vertices connected by semiroutes is called a weak component of \u0393 . Let E = (\u03b5ij ) be the matrix\nof arc weights. Its entry \u03b5ij is zero if and only if there is no arc from vertex i to vertex j in \u0393 . If\n\u0393 \u2032 is a subgraph of \u0393 , then the weight of \u0393 \u2032 , \u03b5(\u0393 \u2032 ), is the product of the weights of all its arcs; if\n\u0393 \u2032 does not contain arcs, then \u03b5(\u0393 \u2032 ) = 1. The weight of a nonempty set of digraphs G is defined as\nfollows:\nX\n\u03b5(G) =\n\u03b5(H);\nH\u2208G\n\nthe weight of the empty set is 0.\nThe Kirchhoff matrix [17] of a weighted digraph \u0393 is the n \u00d7 n-matrix L = L(\u0393 ) = (lij ) with\nP\nelements lij = \u2212\u03b5ji when j 6= i and lii = \u2212\nlik , i, j = 1, . . . , n.\nk6=i\n\nA diverging tree is a digraph without semicircuits that has a vertex (called the root) from which\nevery vertex is reachable. The indegree of every non-root vertex of a diverging tree is 1. If w is the\nroot, then id(w) = 0. A converging tree is a digraph without semicircuits that has a vertex (called\nthe sink ) reachable from every vertex.\nA diverging forest (converging forest) is a digraph without circuits such that id(w) \u2264 1 (respectively, od(w) \u2264 1) for every vertex w. An out forest (in forest) of a digraph \u0393 is any its spanning\ndiverging (respectively, converging) forest.\nThe weak components of diverging forests (converging forests) are diverging trees (respectively,\nconverging trees).\nDefinition 1. An out forest F of a digraph \u0393 is called a maximum out forest of \u0393 if \u0393 has no\nout forest with a greater number of arcs than in F . An in forest F of a digraph \u0393 is a maximum\nin forest of \u0393 if \u0393 has no in forest with a greater number of arcs than in F .\nObviously, every maximum out forest of \u0393 has the minimum possible number of weak components (out trees); this number will be called the out forest dimension of the digraph and denoted\nAUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL Vol. 62 No. 3 2001\n\n\fSPANNING FORESTS OF A DIGRAPH\n\n445\n\nby v. The number of arcs in any maximum out forest is obviously n \u2212 v. The number of weak\ncomponents of every maximum in forest will be called the in forest dimension of the digraph and\ndenoted by v \u2032 . Obviously, for every digraph, v, v \u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , n}.\nIf a digraph \u03931 is obtained from \u0393 by the reversal of all arcs, then the out forests in \u0393 naturally\ncorrespond to the in forests in \u03931 and vice versa. Therefore, the out forest dimension and in forest\ndimension of \u0393 are respectively equal to the in forest dimension and out forest dimension of \u03931 .\nThe following proposition states that the dimensions v and v \u2032 of a digraph are not connected,\nexcept for the case where v = n and v \u2032 = n.\nProposition 1. 1. Let k, k\u2032 \u2208 {1, . . . , n \u2212 1}. Then there exists a digraph on n vertices such\nthat v = k and v \u2032 = k\u2032 .\n2. For every digraph \u0393 on n vertices, v = n \u21d4 v \u2032 = n \u21d4 E(\u0393 ) = \u2205.\nThe proofs are given in the Appendix.\nThroughout the paper, we mainly deal with diverging forests. However, all the results have\ncounterparts formulated in terms of converging forests. Simple properties of out forests have been\nstudied in [13] (Section 3). We do not cite them here and only confine ourselves to the following\nProposition 2. If i and j belong to different trees in a maximum out forest F of a digraph \u0393,\nand j is a root in F, then \u0393 contains no paths from i to j.\nLet us adduce some definitions and results from [13] which are frequently used below.\nDefinition 2. A nonempty subset of vertices K \u2286 V (\u0393 ) of digraph \u0393 is an undominated knot 2\nin \u0393 iff all the vertices that belong to K are mutually reachable and there are no arcs (wj , wi ) such\nthat wj \u2208 V (\u0393 ) \\ K and wi \u2208 K.\nu\nf = S Ki , where K1 , . . . , Ku are all the undominated knots of \u0393 , and K + is the\nSuppose that K\ni\ni=1\n\nset of all vertices reachable from Ki and unreachable from the other undominated knots. For any\nundominated knot K of \u0393, denote by \u0393K the restriction of \u0393 to K and by \u0393\u2212K the subgraph with\nvertex set V (\u0393 ) and arc set E(\u0393 ) \\ E(\u0393K ). For a fixed K, T will designate the set of all spanning\ndiverging trees of \u0393K and P will be the set of all maximum out forests of \u0393\u2212K . By T k , k \u2208 K, we\ndenote the subset of T consisting of all trees that diverge from k, and by P K\u2192i , i \u2208 V (\u0393 ), the set\nof all maximum out forests of \u0393\u2212K such that i is reachable from some vertex that belongs to K in\nthese forests.\nBy F (\u0393 ) = F and Fk (\u0393 ) = Fk we denote the set of all out forests of \u0393 and the set of all out\nforests of \u0393 with k arcs, respectively; Fki\u2192j will designate the set of all out forests with k arcs where\nj belongs to a tree diverging from i.\nDefinition 3. The matrix J \u0304 = (J \u0304ij ) = \u03c3 \u22121 Qn\u2212v , where \u03c3 = \u03b5(Fn\u2212v ), Qn\u2212v = (qij ) =\nj\u2192i\n(\u03b5(Fn\u2212v\n)), will be called the normalized matrix of maximum out forests of a digraph.\nTheorem 1.

Since LQk the is Kirchhoff matrix of some weighted digraph (Proposition 5), all\nits principal minors are nonnegative (by Theorem 6 in [2]). Therefore, all LQk are singular M matrices (see, e.g., item (A1) of Theorem 4.6 in [20]). Alternatively, this can be concluded from the\nnonnegativity of the real parts of the eigenvalues (see Proposition 9 below) and the nonpositivity\nof off-diagonal elements of L (item (F12) of Theorem 4.6 in [20]). It follows from the representation\n\u03c3k+1 I \u2212 Qk+1 = LQk (Proposition 3) of the singular M -matrix LQk that \u03c3k+1 = \u03c1(Qk+1 ), i.e.,\n\u03c3k+1 is the spectral radius of Qk+1 , k = 0, . . . , n \u2212 v \u2212 1.

R(A) and N (A) will designate the range\nand the null space of A, respectively.\nAs has been seen in [13], the dimensions of R(J\u0304) and R(LT ) are v and n \u2212 v, respectively.\nFurthermore, R(LT ) \u2229 R(J\u0304) = {0} and, since the dimensions of R(LT ) and R(J\u0304) sum to n, Rn\ndecomposes to the direct sum of R(LT ) and R(J\u0304):\nRn = R(LT )+\u0307R(J\u0304).\n\n(19)\n\nSince LJ \u0304 = 0 (Theorem 3), we get N (L) = R(J\u0304) and N (J\u0304 ) = R(LT ), thus, the sum (19) is\northogonal.\n \u0304 = 0, the orthogonal decomposition\nSimilarly, in view of JL\nT\n\nRn = R(L)+\u0307R(J\u0304 )\nT\n\nAUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL Vol. 62 No. 3 2001\n\n\fSPANNING FORESTS OF A DIGRAPH\nT\n\n451\nT\n\nholds along with R(L) \u2229 R(J\u0304 ) = {0}, N (J\u0304) = R(L), and N (LT ) = R(J\u0304 ).\nIn accordance with (19), every vector u \u2208 Rn is uniquely represented as u = u1 +u2 , where u1 \u2208\nT\nT\nT\nR(LT ) = N (J\u0304 ) and u2 \u2208 R(J\u0304) = N (L).

THE MOORE-PENROSE AND GROUP INVERSES OF THE KIRCHHOFF MATRIX\nIn this section, we obtain some expressions for the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse and the\ngroup inverse of the Kirchhoff matrix L. The Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a rectangular\ncomplex matrix A is the unique matrix X such that\n(1) AXA = A,\n(2) XAX = X,\n(3) (AX)\u2217 = AX,\n(4) (XA)\u2217 = XA,\nwhere (AX)\u2217 and (XA)\u2217 are the conjugate transposes (Hermitian adjoints) of AX and XA, respectively.\nFor any matrix A, the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse, A+ , does exist and is unique. If A is\nnonsingular, then A+ coincides with A\u22121 .\nThe Moore-Penrose inverses are of theoretical and practical interest. The latter is because A+\nprovides the normal pseudosolution of the inconsistent equation Ax = b: it is x = A+ b. The\nnormal pseudosolution is a vector of the minimum length that minimizes the length of Ax \u2212 b (the\nminimum norm least-squares solution). As applied to Laplacian matrices, such solutions, among\nothers, were considered for some preference aggregation problems (more specifically, estimation\nfrom paired comparisons) [23], in constructing geometrical representations for systems modelled by\ngraphs [24], in the analysis of social networks, and cluster analysis.\nThe group inverses are no less important (see, e.g., [22]). A matrix X is the group inverse of\na square matrix A, if X satisfies the conditions (1) and (2) in the definition of Moore-Penrose\ngeneralized inverse and also\n(5) AX = XA.\nThe group inverse of A is denoted by A# . Generally, group inverses need not exist, but if such\na matrix exists, then it is unique, but A+ = A# is not necessary.\nIf L is symmetric (in particular, this is the case for symmetric digraphs, which can be identified\n \u0304 \u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u22121 J \u0304 (with any \u03b1 > 0) is [15] the Moorewith undirected graphs), then the matrix (L + \u03b1 J)\nAUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL Vol. 62 No. 3 2001\n\n\f452\n\nAGAEV, CHEBOTAREV\n\nPenrose generalized inverse and the group inverse of L.

ACCESSIBILITY VIA FORESTS AND DENSE FORESTS IN DIGRAPHS\n8.1. Forest accessibility\nThe entries of Q(\u03c4 ) measure the proximity of the vertices of an undirected multigraph [14, 15].\nT\nThe matrix J \u0304 = lim\u03c4 \u2192\u221e QT (\u03c4 ) was analyzed in [13] as the matrix of limiting accessibilities of a\nmultidigraph. Here, we study the matrix P 1 (\u03c4 ) = QT (\u03c4 ) with \u03c4 > 0 as an accessibility measure\nfor digraph vertices. By Theorem 4, the (i, j)-entry of this matrix is the total weight of out forests\nthat \"connect\" i with j in the digraph where the weights of all arcs are multiplied by \u03c4 . Along with\nP 1 (\u03c4 ), we consider the matrix of in forests P 2 (\u03c4 ). Its (i, j)-entry is the total weight of in forests\n(of the modified digraph) where j is a sink and i belongs to a tree converging to j.\nThe following definition is formulated for an arbitrary vertex accessibility measure (formally,\nevery square matrix of order n or, more precisely, the corresponding matrix-valued function of a\ndigraph can be considered as such a measure). A measure P 2 is called to be dual to a measure P 1\nif under the reversal of all arcs in an arbitrary digraph (provided that the weights of the arcs are\npreserved), the matrix of P 2 for the modified digraph coincides with P1T calculated for the initial\ndigraph. It follows from this definition that P 2 is dual to P 1 if and only if P 1 is dual to P 2 . In [15],\nthree self-dual accessibility measures were studied.\nLet us check the satisfaction of the characteristic conditions listed below for P 1 (\u03c4 ) and P 2 (\u03c4 ).\nTriangle inequality for accessibility measures requires the symmetry of the corresponding matrix\nAUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL Vol. 62 No. 3 2001\n\n\f454\n\nAGAEV, CHEBOTAREV\n\n(see, e.g., [26]).

For any digraph \u0393 and any i, k, t \u2208 V (\u0393 ), if \u0393 includes a path from i to\nk, i 6= k 6= t, and every path from i to t contains k, then (1) pik > pit ; (2) pkt > pit .\nMonotonicity. Suppose that the weight of some arc \u03b5pkt in a digraph \u0393 increases. Then:\n(1) \u2206pkt > 0 and for any i, j \u2208 V (\u0393 ), (i, j) 6= (k, t) implies \u2206pkt > \u2206pij ;\n(2) For any i \u2208 V (\u0393 ), if there is a path from k to t, and each path from k to i includes t, then\n(a) \u2206pkt > \u2206pki and (b) \u2206pki > \u2206pti ;\n(3) For any i \u2208 V (\u0393 ), if there is a path from i to k and every path from i to t includes k, then\n(a) \u2206pkt > \u2206pit and (b) \u2206pit > \u2206pik .\nThe results of testing P 1 (\u03c4 ), P 2 (\u03c4 ), and P 3 (\u03c4 ) are collected in the following proposition.\nProposition 11. The measures P 1 (\u03c4 ) and P 2 (\u03c4 ) are dual to each other for every \u03c4 > 0.\nThey satisfy nonnegativity, reversal property, disconnection condition, the first part of item 1, and\nitem 2 of monotonicity. Moreover, P 1 (\u03c4 ) satisfies items 1 of diagonal maximality and transit\nproperty; P 2 (\u03c4 ) satisfies items 2 of these conditions. With respect to the remaining statements of\nmonotonicity, P 1 (\u03c4 ) satisfies items 2 and 3b, whereas P 2 (\u03c4 ) satisfies items 3 and 2b, and they both\nviolate the second part of item 1. Furthermore, P 1 (\u03c4 ) breaks item 3a of monotonicity and item 2\nof transit property, whereas P 2 (\u03c4 ) breaks item 2a of monotonicity and item 1 of transit property.\nTriangle inequality for P 3 (\u03c4 ) is not satisfied.\nT\nAs was noted in [13], the limiting accessibility P = J \u0304 of a digraph does not completely correspond to the general concept of proximity. Notice that disconnection condition, which is satisfied\nfor the limiting accessibility in one side only, is completely fulfilled for P 1 (\u03c4 ) and P 2 (\u03c4 ). Moreover,\nP 1 (\u03c4 ) and P 2 (\u03c4 ) obey a number of conditions which are satisfied by the limiting accessibility in\nthe nonstrict form only.3\n\n8.2. Accessibility via dense forests\nNow we consider a measure which is intermediate between the limiting accessibility (which\ndepends on Qn\u2212v only) and the forest accessibility Q(\u03c4 ) (which is a weighted sum of all matrices Qk ).\nThis new measure is determined by the matrices Qn\u2212v\u22121 and Qn\u2212v (or, equivalently, by the matrices\n3\n\nBy the nonstrict form of a condition we mean the result of substituting nonstrict inequalities (\u2265 and \u2264)\nfor the strict ones (> and <) in it.\nAUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL Vol. 62 No. 3 2001\n\n\fSPANNING FORESTS OF A DIGRAPH\n\n455\n\n \u0304 which also determine L# as stated in Proposition 8).

Spanning rooted forests (of an undirected multigraph) with n \u2212 v or n \u2212 v \u2212 1 arcs are\ncalled in [15] dense forests, and the undirected counterpart of the accessibility measure (23) with\n\u03c3n\u2212v\nis called accessibility via dense forests.\n0 < \u03b1 < \u03c3n\u2212v\u22121\n\nConsider two accessibility measures for digraphs: P 1 (\u03b1) = RT (\u03b1), accessibility via dense diverging forests and P 2 (\u03b1), accessibility via dense converging forests.\nAn important property of the set of dense diverging forests is as follows.\nProposition 12. 1. For any vertex i \u2208 V (\u0393 ), there exists an out forest in Fn\u2212v\u22121 where i is\na root. 2. For any path (chain subgraph) in \u0393, there exists an out forest in Fn\u2212v\u22121 \u222a Fn\u2212v that\ncontains this path.\nA similar proposition is true for converging forests. At the same time, the set of maximum out\nforests Fn\u2212v and the set of maximum in forests do not have this property. For example, on Fig. 1\nin [13], no maximum out forest contains arc (4, 2).\nWe now test P 1 (\u03b1) and P 2 (\u03b1). Similar to the previous consideration, triangle inequality for\naccessibility measures will be checked for the index P 3 (\u03b1) = (P 1 (\u03b1) + P1T (\u03b1) + P 2 (\u03b1) + P2T (\u03b1))/4,\nsince this inequality requires the symmetry of the corresponding matrix.\nProposition 13. For any \u03b1 \u2208] 0, \u03c3n\u2212v /\u03c3n\u2212v\u22121 [, the measures P 1 (\u03b1) and P 2 (\u03b1) are dual to each\nother. They satisfy nonnegativity and disconnection condition. Moreover, the nonstrict versions of\nitems 1 of diagonal maximality and transit property are satisfied by P 1 (\u03b1), and items 2 of these\nconditions by P 2 (\u03b1). Both measures violate monotonicity. Triangle inequality for accessibility\nmeasures is not true for P 3 (\u03b1).\nCONCLUSION\nThe normalized matrices of out forests are stochastic and determine the transition probabilities\nin the geometric observation model applied to the Markov chains related to the digraph under\nconsideration. Various matrices of forests can be represented by simple polynomials of the Kirchhoff\nmatrix. The Moore-Penrose generalized inverse L+ and the group inverse L# of the Kirchhoff\nmatrix L can be explicitly represented via L and the normalized matrix J \u0304 of digraph's maximum\nout forests. The matrices of diverging and converging forests characterize the pairwise accessibility\nof vertices. These and other results enable one to consider the matrices of spanning forests as a\nuseful tool for the analysis of digraph's structure.\nAPPENDIX\nProof of Proposition 1. 1. At first, let k \u2264 k\u2032 < n. \u0393 is constructed as follows. We draw\na diverging star rooted at the first vertex and having k\u2032 \u2212 k leaf vertices. Also, we draw a path\ndiverging from the root of the star and containing, in addition to the root, n \u2212 k\u2032 \u2265 1 vertices that\nAUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL Vol. 62 No. 3 2001\n\n\f456\n\nAGAEV, CHEBOTAREV\n\nare not included in the star. The remaining k \u2212 1 vertices are left isolated. Then v = 1 + (k \u2212 1) = k\nand v \u2032 = 1 + (k\u2032 \u2212 k) + (k \u2212 1) = k\u2032 , as required.\nIf k\u2032 \u2264 k < n, then we draw a star converging to the first vertex and having k \u2212 k\u2032 other vertices.\nAlso, we draw a path diverging to the center of the star and containing, in addition to the sink,\nn \u2212 k \u2265 1 vertices that are not included in the star. The remaining k\u2032 \u2212 1 vertices are left isolated.\nAs well as in the first case, we have v = k and v \u2032 = k\u2032 . The second statement is obvious.\nProof of Theorem 6.

In [13], we used the notion of weighted 2-digraph: it is a multidigraph\nwith arc multiplicities no more than two. The weight of a 2-digraph is the product of the weights\nof its arcs. For a weighted digraph H and its vertices u, w \u2208 V (H), by H + (u, w) we denote\nthe 2-digraph with vertex set V (H) and the arc multiset obtained from E(H) by the increment\nof the multiplicity of (u, w) by 1. Similarly, if H is a 2-digraph and u, w \u2208 V (H), then by H \u2032 =\nH \u2212(u, w) we denote the 2-digraph that differs from H in the multiplicity of (u, w) only: n\u2032 ((u, w)) =\nmax(n((u, w)) \u2212 1, 0).\nNow introduce the following notation. Let Fkj\u2192s +(l, i) = {Fkj\u2192s + (l, i) | Fkj\u2192s \u2208 Fkj\u2192s }.

Observe that the digraph resulting from \u0393 by multiplying the weights of all arcs by \u03c4 has the Kirchhoff matrix \u03c4 L, and its total weight of out forests\nwith j arcs is \u03c4 j \u03c3j . Hence, the required statement follows from Theorem 8.\nProof of Theorem 10. We first prove the following lemma.\nLemma 4. If a maximum out forest of a digraph \u0393 is a tree, i.e., the out forest dimension of\n\u0393 is 1, then L + J \u0304 is nonsingular.\n \u0304 = 0. Then there exists a vector\nProof of Lemma 4.

Expand the determinant\nof M in the last column (which consists of ones). By the matrix-tree theorem for digraphs (see,\ne.g., [1, 16]), if there exists a spanning tree diverging from i, then the cofactor of lin in L-which\nequals the cofactor of the ith entry of the last column of M -is positive, whereas, in the opposite\ncase, it is zero. By the hypothesis of this lemma, the maximum out forests of \u0393 are diverging\ntrees. Therefore, the cofactor of at least one entry of the last column of M is positive. Hence,\ndet M expanded as above is also positive. Thereby, rank M = n, whence the unique solution of the\nsystem (30) is b1 = * * * = bn = 0. This contradiction proves Lemma 4.\nSuppose that V1 , . . . , Vp are the vertex sets of the weak components of \u0393 .

Consequently, the sth block of J \u0304 coincides with J \u0304 .\nBy virtue of (32) and (33), it is sufficient to prove the statement of the theorem for the case of\np = 1. Let \u0393 consist of a single weak component. Suppose, without loss of generality, that V (\u0393 )\nis indexed in such a way that the first numbers are attached to the vertices in K1 , the subsequent\nf By\nnumbers to the vertices in K2 , etc. The last numbers are given to the vertices in V (\u0393 )\\K.\nitem 2 of Theorem 1, L + J \u0304 is a block lower triangular matrix with v + 1 blocks: K1 corresponds\nf corresponds to the last block.\nto the first block, Kv corresponds to the vth block; V (\u0393 )\\K\nThe determinant of the block triangular matrix L + J \u0304 is the product of the determinants of\nits diagonal blocks, whereas its rank is no less than the sum of ranks of the diagonal blocks (see,\ne.g., [25]). Note that, as well as in the case of weak components of \u0393 (see above), the block of L + J \u0304\n \u0304 K ) constructed\ncorresponding to an undominated knot Ki , coincides with the matrix L(\u0393Ki ) + J(\u0393\ni\nfor \u0393Ki . To demonstrate this, it suffices to use item 3 of Theorem 1. Every maximum out forest of\nan undominated knot is a diverging tree (out arborescence). Therefore, the nonsingularity of the\ndiagonal blocks of L + J \u0304 that correspond to the undominated knots follows from Lemma 4.\nThe (v + 1)st block of L + J \u0304 coincides with the corresponding block of L, since the last block of\nJ \u0304 is zero (by item 2 of Theorem 1). The last block of L is nonsingular. Indeed, by Theorem 6 in [2],\nf is the set of roots. This weight\nits determinant is the weight of the set of out forests in \u0393 where K\nis strictly positive, since the indicated set of forests is nonempty: such forests can be obtained from\nf\nthe maximum out forests of \u0393 by the removal of all arcs between the vertices within K.\nThus, the diagonal blocks of L + J \u0304 are nonsingular, hence, L + J \u0304 is nonsingular.
