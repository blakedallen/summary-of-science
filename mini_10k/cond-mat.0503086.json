During cell motility, the leading\nedge of the cell exhibits a range of dynamic structures such as lamellipodia, filopodia and\n\n\f2\nmembrane ruffles (Small,2002;Pollard,2003). These dynamic surface patterns of moving cells\nare usually observed to have lengthscales in the 1\u03bcm range, and appear in many different\ncell types (Gungabissoon,2003). The lamellipodium is a flat, disk-like extensional structure\ngenerally occurring at the periphery of spreading cells while the filopodia or micro-spikes\nare actin rich needle-like structures seen generally as extensions of the lamellipodium. To\ngenerate movement, the cells use precursor contacts found in membrane ruffles, or on the\nunderside of filopodia, which can help form adhesive contacts. The lamellipodia are generally\nextruded in the direction of a strong signal such as a chemoattractant that induces cell\nmigration. The extracellular stimulus turns on certain membrane bound activators that in\nturn activate a series of proteins that trigger actin branching and polymerization leading\nto a directed and regulated protrusive force. The interplay between the dynamics of the\nactivators, the protrusive forces generated by the actin polymerization and the membrane\ndynamics results in the rich variety of dynamic structures described above. This kind of\nactin based motion is ubiquitous with examples ranging from the chemotaxis of macrophages\nto the movement of metastatic tumor cells. Since cell motility depends so crucially on the\nformation of these dynamic membrane structures, it is imperative to understand the origin\nand dynamics of these structures.\nThere have been a number of theoretical approaches to the problem of cell motility driven\nby actin polymerization (Mogilner,1996;Bottino,2002;Grimm,2003;Stephanou,2004). These\nstudies focus on the inter-relationship between the dynamics of actin polymerization and\nthe protrusive forces generated which lead to propulsion. However, one important aspect\nthat has been neglected so far is the crucial role played by membrane bound activators\n(henceforth referred to simply as activators or membrane proteins), and in particular the\nthermal density fluctuations and the spontaneous membrane curvature associated with the\nactivators. Activators that have been well studied include the Rho family GTPase Cdc42\nand the membrane phospholipid PIP2 (Higgs,2001). These activators bind to, and activate,\nWASp/Scar family proteins by inducing a conformational change. The WASp/Scar proteins in turn activate Arp2/3 which is directly responsible for generating new branches in\nthe actin network (Higgs,2001;Blanchoin,2000;Carlier,2003). Fluctuations in the density of\nthe membrane activators can thus directly lead to fluctuations in the actin branch density\nand hence the protrusive force. Also important is the fact that both Cdc42 and PIP2 have\nbeen shown to induce and sense membrane curvature by binding to BAR domain proteins\n\n\f3\nand epsin respectively (Habermann,2004;Ford,2002). In this paper we propose an approach\nthat takes into account density fluctuations and membrane curvature associated with the\nmembrane activators. The dynamics of the actin polymerization, and its dependence on\nthe relative concentration of actin and supporting proteins, has been calculated by Carlsson\n(Carlsson,2003). This gives us the steady-state velocity of the advancing membrane and\nactin gel, as a function of the branching rate which is directly proportional to the membrane density of the activators. We therefore separate the in-cell dynamics of the actin\npolymerization, from the in-membrane dynamics of the activators. The diffusion and spontaneous curvature associated with these membrane activators will determine the time and\nlength-scales of the dynamic patterns. This allows us to write a simple model and arrive\nat analytical expressions, while still preserving the rich variety of dynamical behavior that\nis observed. The merits of such an approach, apart from the knowledge gained concerning\ndynamical models, lie in its quantitative and testable predictions for cell motility in vivo.\nOur\n\nwork\n\ndraws\n\non\n\nprevious\n\nmodels\n\nof\n\ninstabilities\n\nin\n\nactive\n\nmembranes\n\n(Chen,2004;;Sankararaman,2004;Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000;Prost,1998),\n\nsome of\n\nwhich we have combined here into a simpler form. The previous analyses are different\nin essential ways from the present study. They consider the case where the active membrane\nproteins are ion-pumps and therefore solve for the fluid circulations, which is not necessary here. The first analysis (Chen,2004) considers a system close to a phase separation\ntransition, which is not a constraint in our work. The possibility of wave-like propagation for negative spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins, was also not considered\n(Chen,2004;Sankararaman,2004). The second analysis (Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000)\ndoes find propagating modes, but does not specifically relate them to the spontaneous curvature of the membrane activators. Our model is therefore an application of these previous\nstudies to the case of actin-driven cellular motility. It allows us to describe, in a very detailed\nand transparent way, the physics of this system in terms of an active membrane.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nWe now introduce our model for the dynamics of the coupled system consisting of the\nmembrane, the activators and the actin polymerization induced forces. The problem we\nwish to solve is shown schematically in Fig.1. We have an average areal density of activating\n\n\f4\nproteins, n0 , which induces actin polymerization such that the membrane moves forward at a\nvelocity given by: v0 = An0 \u223c 1\u22120.1\u03bcm/sec, where A is a coefficient that depends on various\n\nfactors, such as concentration of actin monomers, temperature etc., and n0 \u223c 2 * 1015 m\u22122 .\nThe time evolution of the density of these activating proteins is described by a diffusion\nequation (Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000)\n\u2202n\n= D\u22072 n \u2212 \u039b\u03baH\u22074 h + \u2207 * fn\n\u2202t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere D \u223c 1\u03bcm2 /sec is the in-membrane diffusion coefficient of the proteins, \u03ba is the bending\nmodulus of the membrane (typically \u03ba \u223c 10kB T ), \u039b = D/\u03c7 is mobility of the proteins in the\nmembrane where \u03c7 \u2243 kB T is the effective in-plane compression energy of the proteins, H is\nthe spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins, and the thermal noise force satisfies\nthe following correlation: hfn (r, t)fn (r \u2032 , t\u2032 )i = 2n0 \u039bkB T \u03b4(r \u2212 r \u2032 )\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ). The first term\ndescribes the free diffusion of the activators on the membrane, while the last term captures\nthe effect of thermal noise. Evidence for free diffusion of the membrane proteins that activate\nthe polymerization of actin, appears in (Gerisch,2004). The second term takes into account\nthe coupling between the spontaneous curvature of the activators and the local curvature of\nthe membrane. Here h refers to the coordinate that measures the normal displacement of\nthe membrane from a flat reference plane.\nThe membrane deviation from flatness obeys the following equation of motion\n\u2202h\n=\u2212\n\u2202t\n\nZ\n\ndr \u2032 \u039b(r \u2212 r \u2032 )\u03ba\u22074 h(r \u2032 ) + An\n\n(2)\n\nfor a free, flat membrane. Here the first term is simply the response of a membrane that is\nsurrounded by a fluid, characterized by the hydrodynamic interaction kernel \u039b. After Fourier\ntransforming into q-space, the hydrodynamic interaction kernel is given by \u039b(q) = 1/4\u03b7q,\nand the response of the free membrane is \u03c9q = \u03baq 3 /4\u03b7, where \u03b7 is the viscosity of the\nsurrounding fluid. We note that if the edge of the membrane is highly curved, then the\nmembrane response is different. We take the response in this limit to be: \u03c9q,1 \u223c \u03baq/4\u03b7d2,\nwhere d is the local radius of curvature at the membrane edge (Fig.1), assuming that the\nhydrodynamic interaction (Oseen kernel) remains the same as that for the flat membrane\n(Zilman,2002). A similar form for the response of a flat membrane occurs when tension is\ndominant and is given by \u03c9q,t = \u03c3q/2\u03b7, where \u03c3 is the effective surface tension. This regime\noccurs for wavevectors: q < qt =\n\nq\n\n\u03c3/\u03ba. In the analysis below, the results using either \u03c9q,1\n\n\f5\nor \u03c9q,t are interchangeable, by making the transformation: \u03ba/2d2 \u2194 \u03c3. The second term\ndescribes the action of the actin polymerization induced forces, whose effect we model by the\naddition of a velocity to the membrane. This velocity is taken to be directly proportional to\nthe local density of activators, with a proportionality constant, A, as described above. The\ntwo equations (eqs. 1,2) form a coupled set that completely describes the dynamics of our\nsystem. We now describe, in detail, the assumptions that we make in our model.\n\nA.\n\nDiscussion of assumptions\n\nIn this paper, we assume that the membrane proteins do not bind to the actin network,\nand that the diffusion coefficient (in eq.1) is homogeneous. The diffusion coefficient, D,\nmay be treated as an effective value, which takes into account the average (uniform) effect\nof actin interactions with the membrane proteins. This is an approximation, since the\ndiffusion coefficient is likely to decrease when the density, n, increases, due to a \"crowding\neffect\" (Almeida,1995). It may also depend on the actin density. Future work may include\nthe dependence of the diffusion coefficient on the actin density, membrane curvature and\nthe dynamics of protein-actin binding/unbinding. The binding of the membrane proteins\nto the actin network that they nucleate, introduces an effective attraction between them,\nwhich may drive phase separation. An effective protein-protein interaction will introduce a\nterm of the form: J(r \u2212 r \u2032 )n(r)n(r \u2032 ), to Eq.1. This possibility is deferred to future studies.\nWe use the term \"activator-proteins\" in the most general sense: it stands for membrane\nproteins that trigger actin polymerization, branching or bundling, that produces in turn a\nprotrusive force on the membrane. In addition to the activators mentioned above, there\nare, for example, the VASP membrane proteins that recruit fascin, which cross-links actin\nfilaments into bundles. These bundles can push more effectively on the membrane, and\nproduce filopodia (Biyasheva,2004). We consider a single species of membrane activator,\nwhich is also constantly in its \"on\" state. A more detailed description could allow for the\nkinetics of the turning-on of these activators, which is a process influenced by the presence\nof other proteins, such as external chemotactic signals or binding of other cellular proteins,\nthe average density n and membrane curvature. Nevertheless, in this paper, we wish to\ninvestigate the dynamics that arise from the simplest model first.\nIn Eq.2, we neglect the thermal fluctuations of the membrane, which are usually much\n\n\f6\nsmaller than the motion due to the actin polymerization (see Section IV). The thermal\nfluctuations of the membrane and the actin-induced motion described above are incoherent\n(decoupled) , so that they simply add to the overall mean-square height fluctuations. We\nfurther expect the thermal fluctuations of the membrane to be almost eliminated when the\nmembrane is being pushed by the actin network, since any membrane motion that is not\nsynchronized with the actin polymerization, such as the thermal motion, will be reduced\nto negligible values due to the large bulk modulus Y of the actin gel, giving mean-square\nheight fluctuations: hh2 i \u221d kB T /Y . The membrane response, \u03c9q , which we used above, for\na membrane that is pushed by the actin polymerization, describes the dynamics of the fluid\nflow outside the cell, and does not need to include the elasticity of the actin network. For the\nsame reason, membrane motion that arises directly from the spontaneous curvature of the\nmembrane proteins (Chen,2004;Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000;Sankararaman,2004), is\nalso negligible since it too is incoherent with respect to the motion due to actin polymerization.\nIn Eq.2 we also assume that there is a linear relation between the density of activators,\nn, (and therefore of activated Arp2/3 protein) and the forward velocity of the membrane.\nThat this assumption is valid for low densities and velocities (i.e. velocities low with respect\nto the saturation polymerization velocity: vp \u223c 1\u03bcm/sec) has been shown explicitly within\nthe context of a model that considers an obstacle driven forward by a polymerizing actin\nnetwork with a spatially homogeneous branching rate (Carlsson,2003). Above a very small\ncut-off branching rate, the forward velocity increases linearly with the branching rate and\nsaturates to a maximum at high branching rates. This behavior is generic and not crucially\nmodel dependent. One can also reach the same conclusion from a continuum perspective.\nAt low densities the branching of the actin gel increases linearly with the activator density\n(Blanchoin,2000). This means that the bulk modulus of the gel will aslos be a linear function\nof the activator density: Y \u221d n. The relation between the velocity normal to the plane of\nthe membrane and the modulus of the pushing gel is given by (Gerbal,2000)\n1\nv\n=\nvp\n1 + FYext\nSb\n\n(3)\n\nAt low gel densities, Eq.3 implies: v/vp \u2243 Y (Sb /Fext ), where Fext is the external drag force\nand Sb is the local area of the membrane which is pushed by the actin gel. Thus we do\nfind a linear relation between the velocity and the density n. At high densities the velocity\n\n\f7\nsaturates at vp , and our analysis breaks down.\nNote that our description of an imposed velocity, v(n) = An in Eq.2, due to the\nactin polymerization, is different from that of an imposed force condition Factin (Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000;Gov,2004). The imposed velocity condition is natural if it is\ndetermined by the dynamics of the actin polymerization in the lamellipodia. This condition\nalso applies if there is a roughly constant drag force due to the actin gel itself (Gerbal,2000).\nOn the other hand, if the motion is determined by the action of the drag force of the surrounding fluid, then it is more natural to keep the imposed force condition, and substitute:\nA \u2192 Factin n/\u03b7q, in Eq.2.\nAnother assumption implicit in Eq.2 is that changes in the membrane density of the\nactivators translates instantaneously into changes in the force with which the actin gel is\npushing the membrane. This is not strictly true, and we now wish estimate the time lag for\nthis process. First there is the chemical time for Arp2/3 activation. This is of order 1msec,\nwhich translates to membrane density fluctuations of length-scale 10nm, which, in turn, is\nmuch shorter than the typical mesh size of the actin gel (\u223c 50nm). So we may neglect this\ncontribution to the time lag. There is growing evidence that the new branches are formed\ndirectly at the free barbed ends of the actin filaments, that are in contact with the membrane\n(Carlier,2003). In this case, there would be no other source of time lag. However, if the\nArp2/3 can diffuse into the bulk and nucleate new branches at barbed ends further back\nfrom the leading edge, it would be another source of time-lag. Experimental observations\nsuggest that barbed ends are localized to a width of \u03bb \u223c 100nm from the leading edge\n(Bailly,1999). The average time for a new filament to grow and cover that distance back to\nthe plane of the membrane, and add to the pushing force, is: t\u03bb = \u03bb/vp \u223c 300msec. On this\ntime scale, the membrane density fluctuations can diffuse away over length-scales smaller\n\u221a\nthan t\u03bb D \u223c 200nm. This length is of the order of 4 unit mesh sizes of the actin gel, while\nwe are interested in a continuum description that is valid over longer length scales. We\ntherefore conclude that, within these limitations, for length-scales longer than 200nm, we\ncan neglect the time-lag.\n\n\f8\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe now solve for the dynamics of the system by first fourier transforming both Eqs. (1,2),\nand using solutions of the form: e\u2212i(\u03c9t+q*r) . This gives the following system of equations in\nmatrix form\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec \u2212i\u03c9 + \u03c9D\n\uf8ed\n\n\u2212A\n\n\u2212Bq 4\n\u2212i\u03c9 + \u03c9q\n\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\uf8ec n \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8ed\n\nh\n\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec \u2212ifn q \uf8f7\n\n=\uf8ed\n\n0\n\n\uf8f8\n\n(4)\n\nwhere B \u2261 \u039b\u03baH and \u03c9D = Dq 2 . The dispersion equation of the protein density n and\nmembrane height h respectively, is given by equating the determinant of the matrix in Eq.4\nto zero, which yields\nq\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n2\n\u03c9D + \u03c9q \u2212 4ABq 4 + \u03c9D\n\u2212 2\u03c9D \u03c9q + \u03c9q2\n2\nq\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n2\n\u2212 2\u03c9D \u03c9q + \u03c9q2\n\u03c9h = \u2212i \u03c9D + \u03c9q + 4ABq 4 + \u03c9D\n2\n\n\u03c9n = \u2212i\n\n(5)\n\nwhere, the time-dependent response is given by (n, h)(t) \u221d exp (\u2212i\u03c9n,h t). It is to be noted\nthat these solutions decay exponentially in time if Re[\u03c9n,h ] > 0. We now discuss the results\nfor two different cases, positive (H > 0) and negative (H < 0) spontaneous curvature of the\nmembrane activator proteins.\n\nA.\n\nPositive spontaneous curvature\n\nMembrane activators with positive spontaneous curvature (H > 0) will prefer to aggregate\nat the locations with maximum local curvature (Fig.2). The solution for the membrane\nheight h, in this case, decays with time (Im[\u03c9h ] > 0, Re[\u03c9h ] = 0), while for the membrane\ndensity of the activator proteins, n, we find that there can be an instability in the form of\nan exponentially increasing function of time (Im[\u03c9n ] < 0, Re[\u03c9n ] = 0)(Fig.3a). Depending\non the form of the membrane response we choose, we get unstable behavior for the following\nrange of q-wavevectors\n\u03c9q : q < qc ,\n\nqc =\n\n\u03c9q,1 : q > qc,1 ,\n\nqc,1\n\n4\u03b7AB\n4\u03b7v0 |H|\n=\n\u03baD\nn0 \u03c7\n\u03baD\n\u03c3D\n=\nor\n2\n4\u03b7d AB\n2\u03b7AB\n\n(6)\n\nThese results arise when the bare response of the protein diffusion is faster than the response of the membrane. In this case, the protein aggregates in response to the membrane curvature fluctuations, and builds up density fluctuations as it responds faster\n\n\f9\n(Fig.2).\n\nSimilar instabilities due to aggregation of membrane proteins with positive\n\nspontaneous curvature were described in previous studies of different active membranes\n(Chen,2004;Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000). In Fig.3a we plot \u03c9n and \u03c9h as a function\nof q (for the case of a free tension-less membrane).\nThe general form of the instability criterion, q < qc (Eq.6), follows from comparing the\ntime-scales of membrane motion and in-membrane diffusion of the combined shape-density\nundulations (Fig.2a). These undulations combine a local increase in the membrane protein\ndensity, with the driven (active) normal motion of the membrane. The motion of these\nshape-density undulations can be described by an effective diffusion with a dispersion relation\ngiven by q 2 = \u03c9bump /D \u2032 , where D \u2032 = AB/D = v0 |H|\u03ba/n0 \u03c7. We now discuss the parameters\nthat control this motion. The membrane \"bump\" diffuses faster when the driving velocity\nproduced per membrane protein, proportional to v0 /n0 , is larger. This is because, density\nfluctuations are converted faster into a height undulation. Larger spontaneous curvature,\nH, causes the membrane bumps to have smaller wavelengths, which move faster. Finally,\nlarger osmotic pressure of the membrane proteins \u03c7 results in a larger wavelength of the\ndensity fluctuations, resulting in slower motion. The unstable regime occurs for wavevectors\nwhere the membrane response, \u03c9q , is slower than the rate of diffusion of density-bumps,\n\u03c9bump . In this regime, the aggregation of the membrane proteins can occur before membrane\nundulations decay away. The criterion appearing in (6) is simply a restatement of this result.\nIt is to be noted that the final expression for qc (Eq.6) is independent of both the membrane\nbending modulus, \u03ba, and the membrane protein diffusion coefficient, D. Quantitatively,\nusing the parameters given before (see section II), we find: D \u2032 \u223c D/2.\nThe instability we describe above does not lead to a real divergence, since the velocity\nsaturates at vp and the local density of the membrane proteins saturates due to their finite\nsize. Note that a similar behavior of the critical wavevector of the membrane instability, was\nshown in (Stephanou,2004): kc \u221d ka /Da , where ka is the rate of actin polymerization, and\nDa is the bulk diffusion coefficient of actin monomers in the cell cytoplasm. Comparing to\nour expression for qc (Eq.6), we see that both results are directly proportional to the rate of\nactin growth (ka or v0 ) and inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient in the plane of\nthe membrane, which tends to smooth away the density accumulation (in (Stephanou,2004)\nthe actin diffusion was assumed to be confined to a sub-membrane layer). The details of the\ntwo models are nevertheless very different.\n\n\f10\nB.\n\nNegative spontaneous curvature\n\nFor negative spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins (H < 0), we find that there\nis a range of wavevectors for which the response frequencies \u03c9n and \u03c9h are real (Fig.3b). This\ncorresponds to a wave-like behavior, though still damped (or even over-damped) (Fig.2b).\nThe range of the wavevectors over which this occurs is given by the condition that the\nsquare-root term in Eq.5 becomes negative. This gives\n\u221a\n4\u03b7(2 D \u2032 D + D)\n\u03c9q : q < qw , qw =\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\u221a\n\u03c9q,1 : q > qw,1, qw,1 =\n2\n4\u03b7d (2 D \u2032 D + D)\n\n(7)\n\nThe real parts of the frequencies for the height function and the activator density function are in anti-phase with each other (Fig.3b), and correspond to an effective propagation\nvelocity vef f = Re[\u03c9]/q in the limit of small wavevectors (q \u2192 0)\n\u03c9q :\n\n1 q\nvef f = q (4D \u2032 + D)D\n2\n\nThe damping of these waves is given in this limit by the factor: e\u2212Dq\n\n(8)\n2 t/2\n\n, coming from the\n\nmembrane protein diffusion. For the tension-dominated (second case in Eq.7), there are\npropagating waves in the limit of large wavevectors (q \u2192 \u221e), where we get\n\u03c9q,1 :\n\n1 q\nvef f,1 = q (4D \u2032 + D)D\n2\n\nand the damping of these waves is given in this limit by the factor: e\u2212(Dq\n\n(9)\n2 +\u03c3q/2\u03b7)t/2\n\n. The\n\nq\n\nwaves therefore decay over a length-scale given by: l \u2243 q \u22121 (4D \u2032 + D)D/D, which is of the\norder of the wavelength of the density-height perturbation.\n\nIn Fig.3b we plot the imaginary and real parts of \u03c9n and \u03c9h as a function of q (using \u03c9q\nof the flat and tension-less membrane). Note that for q < qw the imaginary parts of both\nfrequencies are equal, while the real parts have the same magnitude but opposite signs. For\nany choice of parameters, the motion of n and h changes from damped (Re[\u03c9] > Im[\u03c9])\nto over-damped (Re[\u03c9] < Im[\u03c9]) wave-like propagation as q increases (see inset of Fig.3b).\nFinally, when q > qw , we find the usual exponential decay for both functions (Re[\u03c9] =\n0, Im[\u03c9] > 0). At the critical wavevector qw , both the response frequencies have the value:\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03c9h = \u03c9n = \u2212i16( AB + D)(2 AB + D)2 \u03b7 2 /\u03ba2 .\nIn the regime of wave-like propagation q < qw (or q > qw,1 ), the density fluctuations\ntravel faster than the bare diffusion, due to the additional curvature driving force (Eqs.8,9)\n\n\f11\n(Fig.3b). The driving force for the wave-like propagation of density-curvature fluctuations is\nshown schematically in Fig.2b. A local increase in the protein density will result in increased\nmembrane curvature there, which then drives these proteins into lower density areas due to\ntheir negative H, in addition to the usual diffusion. This curvature-induced restoring force\ngives rise to the (albeit damped) oscillatory behavior.\n\nC.\n\nProtein density and membrane height correlations\n\nSo far, we have described the wavevector regimes where, depending on the sign of the\nspontaneous curvature of the activators, one gets either an instability or wave-like modes.\nWe now wish to address the question of the actual amplitudes of the fluctuations that\ncharacterize the motion in these regimes. This we do by calculating the correlation functions\nof the membrane height and of the membrane activator density. Solving Eq.4 we get\nhfn2 (q, \u03c9)iq 2(\u03c9 2 + \u03c9q2 )\n\u03c9 2(\u03c9D + \u03c9q )2 + (\u03c9D \u03c9q \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 ABq 4 )2\nhfn2 (q, \u03c9)iq 2A2\nhh2 (q, \u03c9)i = 2\n\u03c9 (\u03c9D + \u03c9q )2 + (\u03c9D \u03c9q \u2212 \u03c9 2 \u2212 ABq 4 )2\n\nhn2 (q, \u03c9)i =\n\n(10)\n\nIntegrating these functions over \u03c9 we find the spatial (static) correlations hn2 (q)i, hh2 (q)i.\nWe plot these functions in Fig.4, for a free and tension-less membrane. Analytic expressions\nfor these functions can be calculated, but are quite lengthy, so we will give them explicitly\nonly for the limiting cases.\nIt is to be noted that the height fluctuations in our model are derived solely from\nthermally-driven density fluctuations of the membrane proteins.\n\nThis is why we get:\n\nhh2 (q, \u03c9)i \u221d hfn2 (q, \u03c9)i \u221d kB T . These height undulations are superimposed over the average forward motion of the membrane, at average velocity v0 , determined by the average\ndensity n0 .\nAnother notable point is that we assumed a continuous and constant force, or driving\nvelocity, due to the actin polymerization in Eq.2. This is reasonable as long as we are\ninterested in membrane motions on timescales longer than the duration of an individual\nactin polymerization event. More generally, we can describe the actin-induced velocity (or\nforce) by a random shot-noise behavior (Gov,2004), with a typical time \u03c4 . This amounts\nto replacing: A2 \u2192 A2 /(1 + (\u03c9\u03c4 )2 ) in the numerator of Eq.10 for hh2 (q, \u03c9)i. This is easily\n\n\f12\ncalculable, and is found to change the behavior quantitatively, but not to change the value\nof the critical wavevector qc , or the qualitative forms of hh2 (q)i in the q \u2192 0, \u221e limits.\nWe now discuss the form of the density and height correlations in various cases and limits.\nFor positive spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins (H > 0) (Fig.4a), we find a\ndivergence of both the density and membrane height fluctuations at the critical wavevector\nqc (Eq. 6). Around the critical wavevector, setting q = qc + \u03b4, the divergences have the form\n2\n\n4\u03b7v02 H kB T \u03ba 1\nqc2 \u03ba\nhfn2 i\n=\n2D 4\u03b7|\u03b4|(D + D \u2032 )\n\u03c73 n0 (D + D \u2032 ) |\u03b4|\n4\u03b7hfn2 iA2\n1\nkB T\n4\u03b7v02\n\u221a\nhh2 (qc )i = \u221a 4\n=\n4\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03baqc 2\u03c7n0 (D + D ) |\u03b4|\n2qc \u03ba|\u03b4|D(D + D )\n\nhn2 (qc )i =\n\n(11)\n\nwhere, from the last line, we can define: hh2 (qc )i = kB Tef f /\u03baqc4 . The \"effective\u221a\ntemperature\": Tef f /T = 4\u03b7v02/ 2\u03c7n0 (D + D \u2032 )\u03b4, diverges at the critical wavevector. This is\nreminiscent of the divergence in the effective temperature describing the response of active\nhair bundles in the hair-cells of the auditory system (Martin,2001) when there is a resonance\nwith an internal driving frequency. In our case the divergence occurs when the length-scale\nof the active process is in \"resonance\" with the length-scale of the spontaneous curvature.\nIn the limit q \u2192 0, the height correlations have the form: hh2 (q)i = kB Tef f /\u03baq 4 . Here\nwe chose to define an effective temperature, Tef f , since the power law dependence is similar\nto the behavior of the thermal membrane height fluctuations (Safran,1994): hh2 (q)iT =\nkB T /\u03baq 4 .The appearance of thermal-like correlations is not surprising, since the driving\n\nforce for the height fluctuations comes from the thermal fluctuations of the membrane protein\ndensity: hfn2 (q, \u03c9)i \u221d kB T . Thermal-like correlations also appear for various choices of active\nmembranes (Manneville,20001;Ramaswamy,2000;Gov,2004). The effective temperature we\ndefined, has the following limiting forms\nD\u2032 \u2192 0\nD\u2032 \u2192 \u221e\n\n\u03bav02\nv0\nTef f\n\u2192\n=\n\u2032\nT\n2DD n0 \u03c7\n2D|H|\ns\n2\n\u03bav0\nTef f\n1 v0 n0 \u03c7\n\u2192 \u221a\n=\nT\n2 D\u03ba|H|3\n2 DD \u20323 n0 \u03c7\n\n(12)\n\nThe functional form of Tef f /T is very intuitive: the effective temperature increases with the\npushing velocity of the actin v0 , and is inversely proportional to the diffusion coefficient of\nthe membrane proteins, which smooths away the density fluctuations.\nIn contrast, the density fluctuations are finite in the limit q \u2192 0. Note that for the free\n\ndiffusion problem, we recover the usual free diffusion: hn2 (q)i = n0 q 2 kB T D/2wD \u223c n0 . In\n\n\f13\nour model we find in the following limits\nD \u2032 \u2192 0 hn2 (0)i \u2192\n\n\uf8eb\n\nn0 kB T \uf8ed\n1\u2212\n\u03c7\n\nn0 kB T\nD \u2192 \u221e hn (0)i \u2192\n\u03c7\n2\n\n\u2032\n\ns\n\ns\n\nD\u2032\n2D\n\nD\nD\u2032\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\n(13)\n\nThe first limit shows the approach to the bare membrane diffusion in the absence of actin\npolymerization (v0 \u2192 0). In the second limit we find that the rapid formation of membrane\nundulations, due to v0 \u2192 \u221e, effectively localizes the membrane proteins and suppresses any\nlong wavelength density fluctuations.\nIn the limit q \u2192 \u221e the density and height fluctuations are given by\nhfn2i\nn0 kB T\n=\n2D\n\u03c7\n2 2\n16\u03b7 v0 kB T 1\nhh2 (\u221e)i =\n\u03c7n0 \u03ba2 q 6\n\nhn2 (\u221e)i =\n\n(14)\n\nThe density fluctuations are finite, and approach the bare membrane diffusion result (see\nfirst part of Eq.13). The height fluctuations decay in this limit in a non-thermal form,\nreminiscent of similar results for model active membranes (Gov,2004).\nIn the case of negative spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins (H < 0), as\nwe have already seen, no instability occurs (fig.4b). For the density correlations we find\nthat hn2 (q)i is approximately a constant as a function of q (Fig.4b), close to the limiting\n\nvalue hn2 (\u221e)i (Eq.14) of free diffusion. There is a region of reduced correlations, that\ncorresponds to the additional restoring curvature force, which now acts to smooth away any\ndensity fluctuations. The density correlations therefore dip for wavevectors q < qw (Eq.7),\nwhere there is wave-like propagation. The height correlations show a cross-over from 1/q 4\n\nto 1/q 6 decay around qw .\nWe now consider the correlations for the tension dominated case (or thin lamellipodium\nedge). Here the membrane response is given by \u03c9q,1 , \u03c9q,t \u221d q. The results in the low and\nhigh q limits are\nTef f\n4\u03c0v02 \u03b7 2\n,\n=\nT\nn0 \u03c7\u03c3\n\nkB Tef f\nq \u2192 0 hh (q)i \u2243\n\u03c3q 2\nkB Tef f\nq \u2192 \u221e hh2 (q)i \u2243\n\u03baq 4\n2\n\nv0\nTef f\n=\nT\n2D|H|\n\nr\n\n(2D \u2032/D\n\n+ 1) +\n\nq\n\n4D \u2032 /D\n\n+1\u2212\n\nq\n\nr\n\n(2D \u2032 /D + 1) \u2212\n\n4D \u2032/D + 1\n\nq\n\n4D \u2032/D + 1\n\n\f14\n(15)\nThe first limit has the same form as for thermal fluctuations in the tension dominated\nregime, while the large q limit has the form of thermal fluctuations in a free and tension-less\nmembrane, prompting us to express both in terms of an effective temperature.\nOne of the most striking results is that the height fluctuations increase with increasing\nfluid viscosity \u03b7 (Eqs.11-14,15).This behavior can be intuitively understood as arising from\na height fluctuation that is driven at a constant velocity v0 over a time interval that is\nproportional to the viscosity (1/\u03c9q \u221d \u03b7). This is similar to the results of a previous analysis\nof active membranes driven by ion pumps (Prost,1998). In both these cases, the active\nmembrane proteins are allowed to have density fluctuations, while they impose a given\nvelocity on the membrane. This is in contrast to the results of active membrane proteins\nthat produce a fluctuating force with zero average value (shot-noise), where the height\nfluctuations are found to decrease with increasing fluid viscosity (Gov,2004). Note that if\nthe actin imposes a force, Factin , rather than a velocity v, on the membrane, this introduces\nanother factor of 1/q 2 \u03b7 2 to the height correlations hh2 (q)i (see discussion following Eq.2),\nand the dependence on the viscosity is subsequently modified.\nThe density and height fluctuations also increase when the membrane diffusion coefficient\nis decreased (Eqs.11,12,15): hh2 (q)i \u221d 1/D. A similar result appeared in (Prost,1998), but\nwas limited there to the tension-less regime. We find that this behavior also appears in the\ntension-dominated case (Eq.15), which seems to be more realistic for living cells (see next\nsection). The origin of this behavior is very intuitive; slower diffusion allows fluctuations in\nthe membrane protein density to survive longer, causing larger height undulations.\nWe now examine how the correlations depend on frequency. The power spectrum of the\nheight fluctuations as a function of frequency can be obtained by integrating Eq.10 over q.\nThis gives us the temporal correlations hn2 (\u03c9)i, hh2(\u03c9)i. Since the integration is not possible\nanalytically, we do it numerically. We plot the height correlation function in Fig.5, for the\ncell membrane with the elastic parameters: \u03ba and \u03c3. These parameters are found empirically,\nby fitting to the observed thermal fluctuations alone, i.e. when the actin polymerization is\nblocked (Zidovska,2003) (see next section). For comparison we also plot the correlation that\narises purely from thermal fluctuations. This approaches the free membrane limit at high\nfrequencies \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e, where hh2 (\u03c9)ithermal \u2192 \u03c9 \u22125/3 (Zilman,2002). At lower frequencies, in\n\n\f15\nthe tension dominated regime, the thermal behavior is: \u221d \u03c9 \u22121 .\n\nThe active fluctuations are found to have a hh2 (\u03c9)iactin \u221d \u03c9 \u22122 behavior at small \u03c9 \u2192\n\n0, and hh2 (\u03c9)iactin \u221d \u03c9 \u22123 at large \u03c9 \u2192 \u221e. The cross-over occurs roughly where the\nfrequency of the membrane bending modes equals the frequency of the effective diffusion\nof the membrane bumps. For the case when H < 0, the cross-over corresponds to the\nappearance of propagating waves and occurs at the wavevector, qw . The frequency of the\nheight fluctuations corresponding to this wavevector, is given by \u03c9h , shown as the vertical\ndashed-line in Fig.5.\nFuture experiments that probe the power spectrum of the height fluctuations, should show\na clear difference between the thermal and active components. The actin-induced contribution to the height fluctuations are predicted to be much more confined to low frequencies\nthan the thermal contribution.\n\nIV.\nA.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nComparison with experiments\n\nExperimental observations of the actin-driven motion of cells and cell membranes\n(Gerisch,2004;Vicker,2002;Giannone,2004) show both wave-like propagations and finger-like\nfilopodia. Since our model predicts that both behaviors are possible, depending on the sign\nof the spontaneous curvature, H, of the membrane proteins, one possibility is that activators\nwith both types of spontaneous curvature exist in vivo. There is also the possibility that\nthe spontaneous curvature of a membrane activator is altered by a conformational change\nthat is brought about by phosphorylation or binding to another protein (or a number of proteins), either already in the membrane or from the cytoplasm (Small,2002). Thus the cell\nhas many options, all of which it may use to adjust the local concentration of the membrane\nproteins which produce either uniform growth or filopodia (Biyasheva,2004;Nozumi,2003).\nWe predict that these proteins (or protein complexes) have different spontaneous curvatures: H < 0 for uniform growth and H > 0 for filopodia. Indeed for filopodia growth\nthe membrane proteins have to form specific complexes which, in light of our model, must\nhave large spontaneous curvature (Gauthier-Campbell,2004;Wood,2002). These complexes\ncan then recruit crosslinking proteins such as fascin, which help form tight actin bundles\n\n\f16\ninside the growing filopodia (Biyasheva,2004). Future extensions of our model may include\nthe coupling of dynamical changes in the spontaneous curvature, H, to the local densities\nof various proteins.\nAnother source of experimental corroboration for our overall qualitative picture of the\ndynamic co-localization of activator membrane proteins and actin polymerization in high (or\nlow) curvature regions of the leading edge, is provided by the experiments of Nalbant et al\n(Nalbant,2004). The authors visualized the dynamics of activated Cdc42 in living cells and\nshowed that there was a strong correlation between the most recently formed protrusions and\nthe level of active Cdc42 in its vicinity, mostly concentrated at the tips of the protrusions.\nThey also show that the activator proteins are present only near the base regions of filopodia,\nconsistent with our assertion that the activators form the initial seed for the filopodium by\nassembling an actin rich bump, whereafter the newly recruited bundling agents and normal\nbarbed end polymerization of the actin filaments can lead to the filopodia structure.\nFor positive spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins (H > 0), we can estimate\nthe critical wavevectors (Eq.6), using typical values of the various parameters (see sec.II). For\nthe spontaneous curvature we use H \u223c (5 \u2212100nm)\u22121 (Girard,2005). For the flat membrane\n\u22121\ncase we find: qc\u22121 \u2243 1 \u2212 10\u03bcm. For the membrane edge case we find: qc,1\n\u2243 d * (dqc ),\n\nwhere typically: d \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1\u03bcm. Our analysis predicts a specific wave-vector (qc ) which\nbecomes unstable, so that the resulting filopodia should have an average spacing given by\nthe corresponding wavelength. This length-scale appears to correlate well with the observed\naverage separation between neighboring filopodia (Oldenbourg,2000), of 1.5 \u2212 3\u03bcm. Note\nthat from Eq.6, increase in the membrane tension causes an increase in the density of\nfilopodia (Parker,2002). Increased membrane tension was found to reduce the velocity with\nwhich actin polymerization is pushing the membrane (Raucher,2000), so that we expect not\nonly more numerous but also smaller filopodia under increased membrane tension.\nWe predict that the density and height fluctuations increase when the membrane diffusion coefficient is decreased (Eqs.11,12,15). The membrane diffusion coefficient may be\nchanged by addition of various chemical agents, such as changing the cholesterol content\n(Vasanji,2004;Vrljic,2005). Note that changing the cholesterol level may affect the activation of the membrane proteins (Niggli,2004), which is a process that is not included in the\npresent work.\nThis prediction may explain the recently observed low membrane diffusion (high micro-\n\n\f17\nviscosity) at the leading edge of moving cells (Vasanji,2004). The ratio of the diffusion\ncoefficients between the cell side and leading edge is found to be: Dtrail /Dlead \u223c 3. If we\ncorrelate the r.m.s. height fluctuations from Eqs.(11,12) with the average rate of lamelq\nq\n\u221a\nlipodial extension, we predict: Vlead /Vside \u2243 hh2 (q)ilead /hh2 (q)iside \u2243 Dtrail /Dlead \u2243 3.\n\nThis is in good agreement with the measurement (Vasanji,2004). Our model therefore provides a natural explanation for this otherwise paradoxical observation: the membrane is\nstiffer (more viscous) in regions where motility is increased. Presumably larger undulations\nin the shape of the leading edge, help the cell overcome local friction barriers, and results in\nfaster overall motion (Ehrengruber,1996). Additionally, the membrane undulations at the\nmoving front can provide localization points for the formation of adhesion complexes, which\nare important in completing the cycle of cell motility (Lavelin,2005;Zaidel-Bar,2003).\nThis result of our model may also explain the observed response of endothelial cells'\nmotion to shear flow (Tardy,1997;Albuquerque,2003). In these experiments it was shown\nthat the cells move less quickly against the direction of the flow, as compared to the perpendicular and parallel directions. Concurrent with this motion, there is an increase in\nthe fluidity of the membrane in the front part of the cell, by as much as a factor of 2\n(Haidekker,2000;Butler,2001). According to our model the amplitude of the active mem\u221a\nbrane fluctuations is therefore reduced by a factor of \u223c 2 compared to the rear of the\ncell, which is in very good agreement with the measured drop in the fluctuation amplitude\nin the presence of shear (Dieterich,2000). This then results in the observed orientational\nmotility (Tardy,1997;Albuquerque,2003). Such a physical response to shear flow may complement or trigger the biochemical changes that take place in the presence of shear-flow\n(Zaidel-Bar,2005).\nFor negative spontaneous curvature of the membrane proteins (H < 0), we can estimate the critical wavevector (Eq.7) using the values of the parameters that appear above.\nThis gives us qw\u22121 \u2243 1 \u2212 10\u03bcm, which is similar to what we obtained for qc (Eq.6). Thus\nboth the instabilities and the wave-like motions have the property that they occur only\nfor membrane length-scales larger than some critical length-scale, \u223c 1\u03bcm. Indeed, there\nare no long-lived actin structures smaller than this length-scale, on the cell membrane\n(Gerisch,2004;Vicker,2002).\nFor the velocity of the propagating waves, we get from Eq.8: vef f \u223c qD, which results\nin velocities of the order: vef f \u223c 1 \u2212 0.1\u03bcm/sec for wavevectors: q \u223c 1(\u03bcm)\u22121 . Actin\n\n\f18\nwaves with these velocities and wavelengths are indeed observed on the surface of cells\nand lamellipodia (Gerisch,2004;Vicker,2002;Giannone,2004). Note that in these experiments\nthe observed waves are on the bottom part of the cell, where the membrane is largely\nflat next to the glass substrate. Our analysis predicts that the actin waves correspond to\nsmall undulations on the membrane surface (Fig.2b). Our interpretation of these waves is\ntherefore different from that given in (Vicker,2002), where the surface waves are proposed\nto be sections through three-dimensional spiral waves in the cell bulk. Recent experiments\nseem to confirm our interpretation since they suggest that the actin structures are largely\nconfined to the cell membrane (Gerisch,2004), and that the travelling-wave propagation is\nrelated to actin polymerization around a high density Arp2/3 complex (Bretschneider,2004).\nThe formation and decay of these density fluctuations occurs on a timescale, tf luct \u223c 2 \u2212\n3sec, which is in agreement with membrane diffusion times over the lateral size of these\nformations (\u223c 1/2\u03bcm). The slower decay as compared to the formation, \u223c 3.5sec vs.\n\u223c 2sec respectively, may be due to the extra distance to diffuse out of the bump (Fig.2b):\ntf luct * v0 \u223c 0.1\u03bcm. Alternatively the diffusion coefficient may decrease due to the dense\nactin gel formation.\nRecently the static height correlations, hh2 (q)i, were measured on living cells (Zidovska,2003). The mean-square height undulations of the active cell are found to be \u223c 8\ntimes larger than for the inactive cell (Zidovska,2003). The correlations agree with the\ntension-dominated behavior given in Eq.15 (Fig.6), if we use the same parameters as before\nand take the surface tension to be \u03c3 \u223c 0.5 \u00d7 10\u22128 J/m2 . In particular, cells that lack the\nactin-polymerization motility, display much smaller fluctuations (Zidovska,2003) presumably\nof thermal origin. Indeed these fluctuations are well described by confined thermal correlations of the form (Gov,2003): hh2 (q)i \u221d kB T /(\u03baq 4 + \u03c3q 2 + \u03b3), with \u03c3 \u223c 3.7 \u00d7 10\u22128 J/m2 and\n\u221a\n\u03b3 \u223c 2.6 \u00d7 105 J/m4 (Fig.6). The equivalent confinement distance: dT \u2243 kB T /8 \u03b3\u03ba \u223c 70nm,\nis consistent with the average separation between the fibers of the actin mesh, which underlies the membrane. In a normal cell, when actin polymerization is driving the membrane\nfluctuations, there is no meaning to any membrane confinement. It is then possible to fit the\nactive cell data to the thermal fluctuations of an unconfined membrane, with an \"effective\ntemperature\" of Tef f /T \u223c 8 (Fig.6). This approach though does not give us any information about the nature of the active fluctuations. From the q \u2192 0 limit of Eq.15 we get an\neffective temperature of this magnitude if we take: \u03c3 to be smaller than the value given by\n\n\f19\nthe fit to the thermal fluctuations, by a factor of \u223c 8, n0 \u223c (300nm)\u22122 , and an effective\nviscosity \u03b7 \u223c 100\u03b7water . These parameters are within reasonable limits for a cell, but an\nexact comparison with the data awaits independent determination of these parameters.\nOther experimental data (Agero,2003) indicate that in a living cell there is an exponential\ncomponent to the probability distribution function of the height fluctuations, while in a cell\nthat has its actin polymerization blocked, only the usual Gaussian term due to thermal\nmembrane fluctuations remains. We can assume that the usual thermal height fluctuations\nadd incoherently to the active fluctuations, which according to our model arise from the\nfluctuations in the density of the membrane proteins, n. For simplicity let us describe\nthe case where H = 0, so that the density of the membrane proteins is decoupled from\nthe membrane height fluctuations (Eq.1). In the limit of small density fluctuations, the\ncorresponding actin polymerization induced height fluctuations are given by Eq.2\n\u03b4h \u2243 A\u03b4ndt \u223c\n\nAL2 2\n\u03b4n\nn0 D\n\n(16)\n\nwhere the diffusion occurs in a membrane patch of size L over a time: dt \u2243 (L2 /D)(\u03b4n/n0 ).\nThis relation states that larger density fluctuations (larger \u03b4n/n0 ) take longer to diffuse\naway. The probability distribution function of the density fluctuations \u03b4n/n0 is a thermal\nGaussian (Manneville,2001;Ramaswamy,2000), so that combined with Eq.16 we get\nP (\u03b4n) \u2243 e(\u2212\u03c7\u03b4n\n\n2 /n2 k T )\n0 B\n\n\u21d2 P (\u03b4h) \u2243 e(\u2212\u03c7D\u03b4h/v0 L\n\n2k\n\nBT )\n\n(17)\n\nThus the probability distribution does indeed have an exponential component. The larger\nthe driving velocity v0 , the more enhanced the distribution for larger height fluctuations. On\nthe other hand large values of the diffusion coefficient D or membrane protein compression\nenergy \u03c7, narrow the distribution by causing density fluctuations to have shorter life-times\nand amplitudes. A quantitative comparison with the observations awaits future experiments.\nRecent data (Neto,2005) indicates that the velocity of actin induced membrane ruffles,\nis strongly temperature dependent. According to our model this velocity is proportional to\nthe membrane diffusion coefficient (Eq.8,9): vef f \u221d Dq, where q is the inverse of the typical\nlength-scale of these ruffles (usually \u223c 1 \u2212 2\u03bcm (Neto,2005)). Since the diffusion coefficient\nis inversely proportional to the membrane viscosity (Almeida,1995), we expect it to vanish\nat the liquid-gel transition temperature Tm , where the viscosity diverges (Dimova,2000):\n\n\f20\nD(T ) \u221d |T \u2212Tm |1.4 . Using typical values for Tm = 20o C, and q = 0.67\u03bcm\u22121 , we fit the overall\nscale of D(T ) (inset of Fig.7), such that the resulting velocity vef f agrees with the observation\n(Fig.7a). Furthermore, the observed decay time of smaller height fluctuations, also behaves\nas: \u03c4decay \u221d 1/Dq 2, with a larger wavevector (smaller wavelength) of q = 1.15\u03bcm\u22121 (Fig.7b).\nFinally, the mean-square membrane curvature was observed not to depend on the temperature (Neto,2005). The mean-square curvature: hH 2 i =\n\nR\n\nq 4 h2q d2 q, is dominated by q \u2192 \u221e\n\nmodes, while the mean-square amplitude of height fluctuations hh2 i is dominated by the\nq \u2192 0 modes. From our model we predict that for the tensionless membrane, the amplitude\n\nof the q \u2192 0 modes does depend on the diffusion D (Eq.12): hh2 i \u221d 1/D(T ), while the\namplitude of the q \u2192 \u221e modes does not (Eq.14). This difference could explain the independence of the observed r.m.s. curvature on the temperature, except for the very weak\nq\n\u221a\nhH 2 i \u221d kB T which amounts to \u223c 2% over the observed temperature range (Neto,2005).\nDetailed comparisons between our model (namely hh2 (q)i,hh2 (\u03c9)i) and the experimental\n\ndata (Gerisch,2004;Bretschneider,2004), awaits more quantitative analysis of the spatial and\ntemporal shape fluctuations in living cells (Zidovska,2003;Agero,2003;Neto,2005).\nSo far we have discussed the membrane dynamics at the leading edge which is what we\nare modeling. However, our model can also give us insights into phenomena that occur at\nthe cellular scale. An example of complicated, oscillatory dynamics of the bulk actin gel,\nis described in (Giannone,2004). The authors find a periodic interruption (\u223c 20s) in the\nforward motion of lamellipodia that had no filopodia. One possibility for the mechanism is\nshown schematically in (Fig.8). The activating membrane proteins are initially concentrated\nat the lamellipodium edge, and since there are no filopodia we can take the spontaneous\ncurvature to be small or negative. As the forward motion persists the leading edge thins\nsuch that the local curvature is too high for these proteins and they prefer to move to the less\ncurved membrane on the upper surface. This causes a backward propagating wave of actin\npolymerization, which proceeds until the back edge of the lamellipodium. This explains why\nthe contractions occur every tcont \u223c Llam /v \u223c 10 \u2212 30sec, where Llam \u223c 2\u03bcm is the thickness\nof the lamellipodium (Giannone,2004) and v \u223c 0.1\u03bcm/sec is of the order of the calculated\npropagation velocity vef f (Section IV) (Fig.8). The membrane dynamics we considered in\nthe present model are therefore coupled in the cell to the dynamical variations affecting the\nentire actin layer, and this coupling remains to be described.\n\n\f21\nB.\n\nPredictions\n\nOur model allows us to make testable and quantitative predictions. For example:\n\u2022 Changing the fluid viscosity and membrane tension will shift the average density of\nfilopodia (Eq.6).\n\u2022 The velocity of propagation of actin density fluctuations on the cell membrane, is\npredicted to be linear in the diffusion coefficient of membrane proteins (Eq.8).\n\u2022 Similarly, the amplitude of density and height fluctuations are predicted to increase\nwhen the membrane diffusion coefficient is decreased (Vasanji,2004) (Eqs.11,12,15).\nNote that the density of filopodia, given by qc (6), is independent on D.\n\u2022 In the tension-dominated regime, which seems to be applicable to most cells, the long\nwave-length height fluctuations increase with increasing of the fluid viscosity (Eq.15).\nThe same behavior is found also in the tension-less case (Eq.12).\n\u2022 Our prediction that the membrane proteins that initiate filopodia (Nozumi,2003) have\na high spontaneous curvature, has to be tested. Incorporation of these proteins into\nsynthetic vesicles and observing the resulting shape transformations could determine\nthis parameter.\nSome of these manipulations are possible in living cells, while others are better tested in\nsynthetic systems (Vasanji,2004).\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe dramatic membrane dynamics that occur at the surface of stimulated cells is a\nconsequence, not only of the actin polymerization dynamics, but also of the interplay between\nthe dynamics of the membrane itself and that of the activators that reside on it. Keeping\nthis in mind, we presented a simple model that treats the dynamics of a membrane under\nthe action of actin polymerization forces that depend on the local density of freely diffusing\nactivators on the membrane. We took into account the thermal density fluctuations and the\nspontaneous curvature associated with the activators and showed that, depending on the\nspontaneous membrane curvature associated with the activators, the resulting membrane\n\n\f22\nmotion can be wave-like, corresponding to membrane ruffling and actin-waves, or unstable,\nindicating the tendency of filopodia to form. Thus our simple model system managed to\ncapture the wide range of complex dynamics observed at the leading edges of motile cells\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively indicating that the essential physics had been retained.\nOur model not only provides detailed estimates of the morphology and dynamics of the\nmembrane structures, but also provides quantitative explanations for a variety of related\nexperimental observations. These include the puzzling increase in membrane micro-viscosity\nat the leading edge of migrating cells, the appearance of an exponential contribution to the\nprobability distribution of membrane height fluctuations and the temperature dependence\nof the membrane ruffle velocity among others. Thus, our model offers a simple framework\nwith which to analyze and understand experimental data and make quantitative predictions\nto be tested by future experiments.\nWe should, however, keep in mind that cell motility involves many processes which we\ndid not take into account in our model, such as adhesion, formation of stress fibers and the\naction of molecular motors. Even within the context of our model, the dynamics of the actindriven cell motility is largely assumed to be controlled by dynamics of proteins on the cell\nmembrane, which fails to capture the link between the dynamics of these membrane proteins\nand the bulk dynamics of the actin gel, occurring behind the moving front (Plastino,2004).\nIntegrating all these components into a holistic picture remains a challenge. We should\ntherefore view our model as representing the physical dynamics of the membrane-actin\nsystem, which trigger the formation of patterns in the membrane morphology, that are\npart of the overall motility mechanism. Our model therefore provides answers to one part\nof the overall problem of cell motility and should be useful for any integrated approach to\ncellular motility.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nN.G. thanks BSF grant number 183-2002, EU SoftComp NoE grant and the Robert Rees\nFund for Applied Research, for their support.

(a) The Arp activating membrane proteins are\nsymbolized by the black squares, diffusing in the flat membrane. Where they have a high\ndensity the actin polymerization is more extensive (dashed regions) and so is the velocity of\nthe membrane (normal arrows). (b) In the case where the polymerization is confined to a\nthin leading edge, the local high curvature changes the response to \u03c9q,1.\nFig.2: Schematic picture of the two behaviors depending on the spontaneous curvature\nof the membrane proteins. (a) H > 0: fluctuations in the density of the Arp activating membrane proteins grow unstable when the proteins aggregate into the high curvature\n\"filopodia\". (b) H < 0: wave-like propagation due to the restoring force of the curvature,\nbreaking up high density fluctuations (dashed arrows).\nFig.3: Calculated response frequencies of the membrane protein density \u03c9n and membrane\nheight undulations \u03c9h (using \u03c9q of a flat membrane, \u03ba = 10kB T and v0 = 1\u03bcm/sec). The\nbare diffusion rate \u03c9D and bare membrane response \u03c9q are shown by the dotted and dot-dash\nline respectively. (a) H = (10nm)\u22121 : \u03c9n -solid line, \u03c9h -dashed line. The critical wavevector\nqc (Eq.6) below which the density fluctuations are unstable is indicated by the vertical dotted\nline. (b) H = \u2212(3nm)\u22121 : The imaginary parts are given by the solid lines while the real\nparts are given by the dashed lines. The critical wavevector qw (Eq.7) below which the\nwave-like fluctuations occur is indicated by the vertical dotted line. In the inset we show\nthat the imaginary part can be smaller than the real part for small enough q.\nFig.4: Calculated static density and membrane height correlation functions: hn2 (q)i-solid\n\nline,hh2 (q)i-dashed line. (a) H = (10nm)\u22121 : The correlations diverge at the critical wavevec-\n\ntor qc (Eq.6), indicated by the vertical dotted line. The limiting values hn2 (0)i (Eq.13) and\n\nhn2 (\u221e)i (Eq.14) are shown by the horizontal dotted and dash-dot line respectively. (b)\nH = \u2212(3nm)\u22121 : The density correlations dip for wavevectors q < qw (Eq.7), indicated by\nthe vertical dotted line. The height correlations show a monotonous decay, having a crossover from 1/q 4 to 1/q 6 behavior around qw . The limiting value hn2 (\u221e)i (Eq.14) is shown\nby the horizontal dash-dot line.\n\nFig.5: Calculated height fluctuations as a function of the frequency \u03c9. The dash-dot line\nis the thermal fluctuations, that approach \u03c9 \u22125/3 at large frequencies (asymptotic dashedline). The actin-induced fluctuations are given by the solid and dotted lines, for H > 0 and\n\n\f29\nH < 0 respectively. The asymptotic behavior is given by the dashed straight lines: \u03c9 \u22122\nand \u03c9 \u22123 in the limit of small and large frequencies respectively. The vertical dashed line\nrepresents the frequency of the cross-over, roughly given by \u03c9h (qw ).\nFig.6: Calculated static height correlation function hh2 (q)i in the tension-dominated\nregime (Eq.15) (dashed line), compared with the data (Zidovska,2003) for normal cell (stars)\nand inactivated cell (squares). The solid line and dash-dot lines show the behavior for the\nthermal height fluctuations in an unconfined and confined membrane respectively. The lower\npanel shows the two cases: (a) Inactivated cell with confined thermal membrane fluctuations,\nand (b) actin-induced fluctuations in the normal cell.\nFig.7:(a) Calculated velocity of actin-induced membrane ruffles: vef f \u221d D(T ) (solid line),\nwhere D(T ) is shown in the inset. The experimental data (circles) is from (Neto,2005). (b)\nCalculated decay time of actin-induced membrane fluctuations: \u03c4decay \u221d 1/D(T ) (solid line),\ncompared to the experimental data (squares) (Neto,2005).\nFig.8: Schematic description of the periodic contractions found in lamellipodia growth\n(Giannone,2004). (a) The membrane proteins initially localized at the lamellipodia's edge\n(filled circles) produce a forward pushing actin network (shaded ellipse). (b,c) As the edge\nthins they are pushed towards less curved regions at the top of the lamellipodia, and then\npropagate until the back edge. (d) The forward edge is again thicker now, so these membrane\nproteins can localize there and forward motion resumes.\n\n\f30\n\nFIG. 1:\nVIII.\n\nFIGURES\n\n\f31\n\n(a)\n\nTime\n\n(b)\n\nTime\n\nFIG. 2:\n\n\f32\n\nFIG. 3:\n\n\f33\n\nFIG. 4:\n\n\f34\n\nFIG. 5:\n\n\f35\n\nFIG. 6:\n\n\f36\n\nFIG. 7:\n\n\f37\n\nFIG. 8:\n\n\f"}
