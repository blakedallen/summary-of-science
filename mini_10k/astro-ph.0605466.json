Microquasars are sources of very high-energy gamma-rays and, very probably, highenergy gamma-ray emitters. We propose a model for a jet that can allow to give accurate observational predictions for jet emission at different energies and provide with physical information\nof the object using multiwavelength data.\nKeywords. X-rays: binaries, gamma rays: theory, gamma rays: observations\n\nMicroquasars are X-ray binaries with relativistic jets whose emission extends from radio to gamma-rays. In particular, LS 5039, discovered by Paredes et al. (2000), turned\nout to be the first likely high-energy gamma-ray microquasar due to its possible association with the EGRET source 3EG J1824\u22121514 (Paredes et al. 2000). Further theoretical\nstudies furnished with more reliability this association (Bosch-Ramon & Paredes 2004),\nwhich could be extended to other EGRET sources (Kaufman Bernad\u00f3 et al. 2002, Romero\net al. 2003, Bosch-Ramon et al. 2005a). Very recently, Aharonian et al. (2005) have published the detection of the microquasar LS 5039 at TeV energies, leaving no doubt about\nthe gamma-ray emitting nature of these objects. The aim of the present work is to show\nthat from the theoretical point of view microquasar jets can be sources of emission with\nenergies covering the whole spectral band.\nIn our model, the jet is modelled as dynamically dominated by cold protons and\nradiatively dominated by relativistic leptons. The characteristics of the orbit and the\ncompanion star constrain the way in which the accretion takes place. This has been\ntaken into accout for a consistent orbital variability treatment. The magnetic field energy\ndensity and the non-thermal particle maximum energy values along the jet depend on the\ncold matter energy density and the particle acceleration/energy loss balance, respectively,\nand the amount of relativistic particles within the jet is restricted by the efficiency of the\nshock to transfer energy to them. The model takes into account the external and internal\nphoton and matter fields, which interact with relativistic particles in the magnetized\njet, producing emission from radio to very high energies. Concerning the the physical\nparameters of the model, we have adopted the typical values for a massive X-ray binary\nsystem and the standard ones in jet and acceleration theory (OB star, semi-major axis\nof about 0.1 AU, strong stellar wind, jet matter/accretion matter rate ratio of about 0.1,\nmagnetic field of about a 10% of the equipartition one, acceleration efficiencies 10\u22123 10\u22121 qBc). For further details concerning the model, see Bosch-Ramon et al. (2005b).\nThis model has been applied to LS 5039. In Fig. 1, we show the computed SED, and the\nflux and photon index evolution along the orbit for this source. The model underpredicts\nthe fluxes in the radio and TeV band. Although the difference is less than one order\n119\n\n\f120\n\nBosch-Ramon, V. et al.\n\nFigure 1. a) Computed SED for LS 5039 and b) its flux and photon index evolution at\ndifferent energy bands.\n\nof magnitude, it could be interpreted as a hint that more intense high energy processes\n(particle acceleration and emission) are taking place already outside the binary system,\nsince radiation is emitted mainly within the 100 GeV-photon absorption region close to\nthe companion star. This could also lead to higher fluxes in radio, due to this radiation\nis optically thin when emitted outside the binary system. Concerning the variability of\nthe source along the orbit, we have used a particular accretion model for this source\nconsisting in a slow equatorial wind from a fast rotating stellar companion (Casares\net al. 2005), altogether with a stream of matter ejected during the periastron passage\nand reaching the compact object at phase 0.8\u20130.9, when the X-ray (Bosch-Ramon et al.\n2005c) and the TeV peaks (Aharonian et al. 2005, Casares et al. 2005) are observed. For\nmore details concerning the application of the model to LS 5039, see the work of Paredes\net al. (2005). It is worth noting that the total jet kinetic power required for producing\na SED like the one plotted in Fig. 3 is few times 1036 erg/s. Therefore, the very likely\nnature of microquasars and, in particular, LS 5039 as GeV-TeV emitters appears well\nfounded from theoretical grounds.\nAcknowledgements\nV.B-R. and J.M.P. acknowledge partial support by DGI of the spanish Ministerio de\nEducaci\u00f3n y Ciencia under grant AYA2004-07171-C02-01, as well as additional support\nfrom the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER).
