Precise measurements are needed to test modern many-body\natomic theory in this alkali-like system to the 1% level\nand beyond. Such precision is necessary, for example, to\ninterpret proposed measurements of parity violation in\nBa+ and Ra+ [13, 14, 15].\n\u03c4 ~ 6 ns\n74 %\n\n49\nco 3 n\noli m\nng\n\nm = 1/2\n\n6S1/2\n\n27 %\n\n4F5/2\n\n5D5/2\n\u03c4 ~ 32 s\n\nm = 3/2\nm = 1/2\n\n5D3/2\n\nm = -1/2\n\n\u03c4 ~ 80 s\n\nm\n\n73 %\n\nde 614\nsh nm\nelv\n3%\ning\n65\n0\nre\nn\npu m\nm\np\n\n.5 n\n\nBa\n\n\u03c4 ~ 8 ns\n\n+\n\n230\n\n6P1/2\n138\n\n23 %\n\n2051 nm\n\n6P3/2\n\n4\nsh 55 n\nelv m\ning\n\narXiv:0808.1826v1 [physics.atom-ph] 13 Aug 2008\n\nDepartment of Physics, Box 351560, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-1560\n(Dated: October 29, 2018)\n\nm = -3/2\n\nm = -1/2\n\nEarlier we reported [14, 16] developing a technique for\nevaluating matrix elements by precisely measuring offresonant Zeeman-like light shifts in a single trapped barium ion. Here we describe the technique in more detail,\nand present new measurements that, together with previous results [16], provide a more complete picture of\nmatrix elements involving low-lying states of Ba+ . The\ntechnique is in principle generalizable to other atoms and\nions possessing convenient metastable states; we show\nthat unknown matrix elements can be individually targeted by choosing an appropriate off-resonant light shift\nwavelength. The key idea is to determine the ratio of\nlight shifts simultaneously measured in two atomic states,\nthereby eliminating the need to precisely know or control the light shift laser intensity. Our measurements\nplace constraints on the Ba+ matrix elements that can\ntest modern atomic theories, such as the coupled-cluster\nmethod, and ab initio techniques ([8, 11, 12], for example).\nThrough dynamic polarization of a (two-level)\natom [17], an off-resonant light beam shifts the energies\nof atomic states by\n\u03a92\n,\n(1)\n4\u03b4\nwhere \u03a9 is the Rabi frequency that scales linearly with\nthe light electric field strength and the atomic dipole matrix element h1|er|2i, and \u03b4 is the detuning of the light\nbeam from the two state resonance frequency. Eq. 1 is\neasily generalized to multi-state atoms.

After a\nperiod of laser cooling, the 493 nm beam is made dim\nand circularly polarized via an acousto-optic and electrooptic modulator. Since the laser beam is aligned with\nthe dominant magnetic field, optical pumping into one\nof the 6S1/2 sub-levels results with extremely high efficiency; for this discussion we assume pumping into the\nm = \u22121/2 state. Both the 493 nm and 650 nm resonant\nlasers are shuttered, and a precisely-timed pulse of radiofrequency voltage is applied to a half-loop of wire about\n1 mm away from the trapped ion, oriented such that an\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n5 rf/probe pulses\n\n0.1\n\n6.5795\n\n0.8\nShelving probability\n\nAs described in earlier reports [15, 16], we trap single barium ions in a twisted-wire Paul-Straubel ring\ntrap roughly 0.75 mm in diameter. The trap itself is\nmade from tantalum, and all nearby surfaces-vacuum\nfeedthrough pins, ovens containing pure barium, dc compensation electrodes, an electron emission filament, and\na half loop of wire that serves as a source of spin-flip radio frequency fields-are made from non magnetic tungsten or tantalum. A uniform \u223c 1.5 G magnetic field,\nestablished by coils mounted on the vacuum system,\nsplits magnetic sub-levels by a few MHz and avoids a\nfluorescence dark state [23]. Surrounding the vacuum\nchamber and magnetic field coils are two layers of magnetic shielding. Un-lightshifed spin-resonance resolution is ultimately\nlimited by residual magnetic noise of\n\u221a\n\u223c 40 \u03bcG/ Hz at the site of the ion.\nWe perform Doppler cooling on the 493 nm 6S1/2 \u2194\n6P1/2 transition while also applying a 650 nm laser to\nprevent the ion from populating the metastable 5D3/2\nstate. Both of these lasers are locked to an opto-galvanic\nresonance in a barium hollow cathode lamp; the 493 nm\nlaser linewidth is typically 10 MHz while the 650 nm\nlaser linewidth is purposefully broadened by modulation\nto \u223c 100 MHz to destroy a coherent population trapping dark state in this system [24]. Camera optics image the ion fluorescence onto a photo-multiplier tube; we\ntypically observe 4000 counts/s of 493 nm fluorescence\nwhen slightly above saturation. Filtered light emitting\ndiodes (Lumileds) are light sources that cover the 455 nm\n6S1/2 \u2194 6P3/2 transition that can result in a decay to\nthe metastable 5D5/2 'shelving' state, and the 614 nm\n5D3/2 \u2194 6P3/2 transition that correspondingly empties or 'deshelves' the 5D5/2 state. Though the diodes'\nspectra are extremely broad, we nonetheless can drive\nthese transitions at rates exceeding 10 Hz. (We have\ndriven the 6S1/2 \u2194 5D5/2 electric-quadrupole transition\nat 1762 nm, most recently with a diode pumped fiber\nlaser source, which would provide more efficient shelving/deshelving in future experiments.)\n\nShelving probability\n\n0.6\n\n6.5800\nSpin flip frequency (MHz)\n\n6.5805\n\n1 rf/probe pulse\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n5 rf/probe pulses\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n2\nSpin-flip rf exposure time (ms)\n\n3\n\nFIG. 4: Single ion spin resonances in the 6S1/2 state as functions of frequency (top) and exposure time (bottom). See text\nfor a description of the spin sensitive electron shelving technique. We found that the low contrast of the spin resonances\n(due to an unfavorable branching ratio of decays from 6P1/2 )\ncould be improved by exposing the ion to several repeated rf\nspin flips and optical probe pulses as shown here.\n\noscillating magnetic field perpendicular to the quantization axis develops. This pulse is engineered to be the appropriate duration and strength to be a so-called \u03c0-pulse;\nwhen resonant, it causes the ion spin to completely flip\nfrom m = \u22121/2 to m = +1/2. Then, a dim, circularly\npolarized 'probe' pulse of 493 nm light either leaves the\nion alone if it remained in the 6S1/2 , m = \u22121/2 state\nafter the rf pulse, or moves it to the 6P1/2 if the rf pulse\nsucceeded in flipping the spin to m = +1/2. Roughly\n30 % of the time, this excited ion will then decay to the\nlong-lived 5D3/2 state. A 150 ms pulse of 455 nm light\nmoves any ion still in the 6S1/2 state to the 5D5/2 via\na decay from 6P3/2 state (the decay fraction to 5D3/2 is\nfortunately very rare, approximately 3%). Finally, application of bright, linearly polarized 493 nm and 650 nm\nradiation results in ion fluorescence only if the ion is not\nstuck in 5D5/2 ; this is correlated to whether the rf spin\nflip was successful.\nThis measurement sequence is repeated many times to\ngather statistics, and using several trial spin flip radio\n\n\f5\nCorrect exposure time\n\n5\n0.\n\n0.\n\n0.2\n\n4\n\n0.80\n\n0.7\n\n74\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.70\n\nShelving Prob.\n\n0.3\n\n0.\n\n0.75\n\n0.1\n\n0.\n\n0.\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.65\n\n0.3\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\nShelving Prob.\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n5\n0.\n\n2\n\n4\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n0.7\n\n0.74\n\n0.50\n\n0.\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\nMisalignment angle \u03b8 (degrees)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n20\nDetuning \u03b4 / \u03a9\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n1\n0.5\n\nCorrect exposure\nIncorrect exposure\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n20\nDetuning \u03b4 / \u03a9\n\nNo light shift, offset for clarity\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\nSmall light shift\nIncorrect exposure time\n\n0.2\n\n2.550\n\nfrequencies to build a resonance curve as shown in Figure 4; varying the rf pulse duration while on resonance\nshows the Rabi probability flopping. The contrast in such\ncurves is low due to the 30% branching ratio we rely on\nto transfer spin information of the the 6S1/2 into state\ninformation in the 5D3/2 state. We found that we could\nimprove the contrast of the spin resonances by applying repeated rf spin slip and dim 493 nm optical probe\npulses at the expense of the coherent features of the resonance curves. We found that 3\u20135 repetitions yielded the\nmost success; two repetitions mimicked certain aspects of\nRamsey interrogation, complicating curve fitting, while\nmany more repetitions led to broadening of resonances.\nWe aggressively searched for, and did not find at the level\nof 10\u22123 of the light shift, any shifts in the resonance centers due to the additional pulses.\nWe employ a similar technique to measure the\n5D3/2 , m = \u00b11/2 splitting \u03c9D . After a period of laser\ncooling, the 650 nm laser beam is made circularly polarized; for instance, \u03c3 \u2212 . Population accumulates through\noptical pumping in the 5D3/2 m = \u22121/2 and m = \u22123/2\nlevels. The fraction of population in m = \u22121/2, which\nwe call a\u22121/2 , turns out to be an important parameter\nof systematic effects discussed later. Figure 5 shows the\nresult of a rate equation model for determining a\u22121/2 for\na given 650 nm laser misalignment and degree of circular\npolarization; notice that a\u22121/2 is maximized with imperfect polarization. With the 650 nm and 493 nm lasers\nshuttered, a timed radio frequency pulse is engineered to\ntransfer population from the m = \u22121/2, \u22123/2 manifold\nto the m = +1/2, +3/2 manifold of 5D3/2 .

At\nlarge light shifts \u2206D \u226b \u03a9D , the 5D3/2 , m = \u00b11/2 levels are\nisolated into an effective two level system with a different\nRabi frequency than the unshifted J = 3/2 system [25, 26].\nAt small light shifts \u2206 \u223c \u03a9D , the tensor light shift makes all\nthe 5D3/2 splittings quasi resonant, leading to complicated\nlineshapes.\n\nless be defined that results in maximum population transfer in analogy to a spin-flip [26]. The dim, circularly polarized 650 nm laser again probes the 5D3/2 state, transferring any population in the upper spin manifold out to\nthe ground state via a likely decay from 6P1/2 while an\nion left in the m = \u22121/2 or m = \u22123/2 state is likely unaffected. A 455 nm shelving pulse moves an ion in 6S1/2 to\nthe metastable 5D5/2 state, as before. Finally, resonant\n650 nm and 493 nm laser light results in bright ion fluorescence as long as the ion is not in the 5D5/2 shelved\nstate; dim observed fluorescence is correlated with the\nsuccess of the rf spin flip.\nAs seen in previous work [16], and Figure 6, the shape\nof the curves differs from the familiar sin2 \u03a9t dependence\nrelevant in the J = 1/2 case, but can be fit to the solution of the appropriate optical Bloch equations [27].\nSome details of the resonance curves depend sensitively\non the initial condition a\u22121/2 of the 5D3/2 state, as well as\nthe duration, polarization, and alignment of the 650 nm\nprobe pulse.\n\n\f6\n(|\u03c3| > 0.95). The beam is aligned to counter-propagate\nalong the 493 nm and 650 nm resonant beams, and therefore also along the magnetic field, confirmed to within 5\u25e6\nby separate optical pumping experiments.\nWe took interleaved resonance scans of \u03c9S , \u03c9D , \u03c9SLS\nLS\nand \u03c9D\n, the latter being spin-resonance scans with the\nlight shift laser incident on the ion. The scans \u03c9SLS and\nLS\n\u03c9D\ndiffered from \u03c9S and \u03c9D in only two respects. First,\nbecause the residual power, pointing, and polarization\nnoise of the light shift laser causes drift in the frequenLS\ncies \u03c9SLS , and \u03c9D\n, we used higher spin-flip radio frequency voltages during the light shifted scans to powerbroaden the resonances by factors of 2\u201310; however, the\nradio frequency pulse 'area' \u03a9S t was kept constant. Second, the tensor part of the light shift in the 5D3/2 state\nmade the 5D3/2 , m = \u00b11/2 levels an effective two-level\nsystem for light shifts large compared to the spin flip\nRabi frequency; i.e. \u2206D \u226b \u03a9D . In this limit, the spindynamics of the J = 3/2 system changes such that the\neffective \u03c0-pulse exposure time scales down by a factor\nof 2 compared to the unshifted 5D3/2 sublevels [25]; see\nFigure 6. Therefore, the corect spin-flip rf pulse 'area'\nLS\n\u03a9LS\nD tD = \u03a9D tD /2.\nV.\n\nFIG. 7: In this example spin resonance data set, we find the\nZeeman splittings \u03c9S and \u03c9D with and without application\nof an off-resonance light shift laser. Though coherent features\nare observed on the spectral lines, in practice we fit the resonance profiles to Gaussian lineshapes since temporal magnetic\ndrift and light shift laser intensity, pointing, and polarization\nnoise tends to broaden the lines.\n\nIV.\n\nMEASUREMENT OF LIGHT SHIFTS\n\nHere we describe our measurements of the vector light\nshifts \u2206S and \u2206D due to an applied beam of off-resonant,\ncircularly polarized light. The ratio R = \u2206S /\u2206D (see\nEq. 7\u20139) is independent of the intensity of the laser, and\nlargely independent of errors in polarization and alignment; see Figure 7 for an example data run. A previous report [16] details our result using a single-frequency\nArgon-ion laser at 514.531 nm. We will now discuss a\nnew measurement using a 1W, polarization-preserving,\nYb-fiber laser (Koheras) at 1111.68 nm. Though tunable, we operated this laser with no active frequency stabilization; its wavelength was checked with a commerical wavemeter between measurements so that laser frequency variations would cause only a 10\u22125 relative error\nin our reported value of R. After warm-up, the laser's\nlong term power variation, measured after a high quality\npolarizer, was less than 2%. The light shift beam polarization was made circular with an achromatic quarterwave plate (|\u03c3| > 0.9) or Babinet-Solieil compensator\n\nDATA\n\nA typical resonance curve scan consisted of a few hundred spin-flip trials at about 20 equally spaced radio frequencies, 10 or so of which would be on or near-resonant.\nAbout 1 hour of data taking would reach \u223c 1 Hz statistical resolution on the few MHz \u03c9S and \u03c9D . Four to\neight hours of data taking would yield \u223c 0.1% statistical precision on the quantity R; one such data collection\nrun is shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows the results\nof about 40 of these runs at each wavelength, plotted\nagainst \u2206D /\u03a9D , the most important parameter leading\nto systematic effects. The fitted slope of R vs. \u2206D is zero\nwithin the statistical errors, implying that the light shift\nratio is independent of laser intensity. Adding statistical\n(one standard deviation) and systematic errors (discussion to follow) together in quadrature, we find that\nR(514.531 nm) = \u221211.494(13),\nR(1111.68 nm) = +0.4176(8).\n\n(10)\n(11)\n\nThe quoted error in the latter result has been \u03c72 corrected by a factor of 1.3 to account for unexplained\nexcess scatter in the data; the reduced \u03c72 of the result\nat 514.531 nm is 1.0.\nVI.\n\nSYSTEMATIC ERROR ANALYSIS\n\nA leading virtue of the experiment design is the lack\nof significant systematic effects. Light shifts are proportional to the laser intensity I, which in general is difficult\nto measure at the site of the ion with any precision. By\n\n\f7\n\nLight shift ratio\n\nrors, fluctuations, and spectral purity. Next, we analyze\nac-Zeeman effects from the trapping and spin-flip fields,\nand finally, systematic fluctuations in the magnetic field\nand ion position.\n\nA.\n\n5D3/2 resonance line shape effects\n\nThough we expect to measure the m = \u00b11/2 splitting\n\u2206D in 5D3/2 , the shifts of the outer two splittings\n\nLight shift ratio\n\n(Light shift / Line width)\n\n(Light shift / Line width)\n\nFIG. 8: Light shift ratio data at 514 nm and 1111 nm plotted against the most important parameter for systematic effects, \u2206D /\u03a9D (the light shift magnitude over the 5D3/2 resonance linewidth). Data in the shaded regions are cut from\nthe straight line fit because the size of the lineshape fitting\nerror is expected to be > 10\u22123 while the sign is uncontrolled;\nthis explains the large scatter at low \u2206D /\u03a9D . In each case,\nthis data cut does not change the fitted values for R beyond\nthe quoted errors. No statistically significant slopes are derived from these plots which might otherwise imply an effect\ndue to hyperpolarizability. To account for the larger than expected scatter in the 1111 nm data, we have \u03c72 -corrected the\nreported value.\n\nmeasuring the light shifts in two states, however, the intensity drops out completely in the ratio R. By choosing\nto measure the m = \u00b11/2 splittings in both the 6S1/2 and\n5D3/2 , errors in laser polarization and alignment affect\nthe light shift ratio only in second order. By interleaving the measurements temporally, noise and drift in the\nmagnetic field, laser pointing, polarization, and intensity\nare shared by both shifted and unshifted resonances and\nthus do not contribute to the ratio.\nThe effects that remain are smaller than the statistical precision of the data. The first effect documented\nin this section is the most important: line-shape effects\nthat plague the light-shifted 5D3/2 resonance. We then\nconsider laser problems: misalignments, polarization er-\n\n\u2206upper \u2261 E5D3/2 ,m=3/2 \u2212 E5D3/2 ,m=1/2 \u2212 \u03c9D ,\n\n\u2206lower \u2261 E5D3/2 ,m=\u22121/2 \u2212 E5D3/2 ,m=\u22123/2 \u2212 \u03c9D\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\nLS\nnevertheless play a role in shifting the \u03c9D\nlineshape\nthrough distortions of the resonance profile. Only the\nvector part of the light shift Hamiltonian shifts magnetic sublevels an amount proportional to m. While\nscalar shifts are completely undetectable, the tensor shift\nmakes \u2206upper and \u2206lower in general different than \u2206D =\n\u2206middle . If the light shifts are comparable in size to the\nspin-flip Rabi frequency \u2206D \u223c \u03a9, then all the shifted\n5D3/2 , m \u2194 m \u00b1 1 resonances are quasi-resonant with\nthe spin-flip field. Since our optical pumping method\nprepares the 5D3/2 state in some statistical mixture of\nthe m = \u22121/2, \u22123/2 states, the resulting spin resonance\ncurves can be quite complicated and distorted as illustrated in Figure 6. We expect the size of the distortion\nto decrease as the relative size of the vector light shift\n\u2206D /\u03a9D increases; this is confirmed with a model of the\nBloch equations. Also, the sign of the distortion reverses\nif the sense of circular polarization of either the 650 nm\noptical pumping beam, or the light shift beam polarization reverses; this explains the large scatter of the data\nin Figure 8 at small relative light shifts \u2206D /\u03a9D . For\ndata collected with the 1111.68 nm laser, we performed\nan equal number of data runs in each of the four possible light shift polarization and 5D3/2 state preparation\nconfigurations.\nWe observe that the size of the distortion depends sensitively on the optical pumping conditions that prepare\nthe ion, while the sign depends on the sense of light\nshift circular polarization \u03c3 < 0 or \u03c3 > 0, and whether\nthe ion is initially prepared in the m = \u22121/2, \u22123/2 or\nm = +1/2, +3/2 manifolds by choosing a \u03c3 \u2212 or \u03c3 + polarized 650 nm beam during optical pumping. We modeled the optical pumping, light shift Hamiltonian, rf spinflip, and detection-by-shelving aspects of the experiment\nby numerically integrating the Bloch equations with the\nspin flip Hamiltonian using Runge-Kutta routines [28] for\nall conceivable experimental conditions at several candidate light shift wavelengths. Simulated experimental\ndata were then subjected to our curve fitting routines to\ndetermine \u2206D as we would measure it. The expected\nrelative \u2206D shift error is plotted in Figure 9 against the\nrelevant scaling parameter: the ratio of light shift to spinflip Rabi frequency \u2206D /\u03a9D . Intuitively, for \u03c0-pulses of\n\n\f8\n0\n\ncircular polarization aligned along the magnetic field. We\nwill show in this section that the light shift ratio R is\ninsensitive to misalignments and errors in polarization as\nlong as the light shifts are much smaller than the Zeeman\nshifts,\n\n10\n\n-1\n\nRelative line fitting error\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n514 nm\n\n\u2206S \u226a \u03c9S ,\n\u2206D \u226a \u03c9D .\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n1111 nm\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n20\n(Light shift / linewidth)\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFIG. 9: Models of the 5D3/2 spin resonance line-fitting error. The top graph compares the typical error magnitude for\n514 nm and 1111 nm light shifts considered here. The bottom graph shows the error profiles for some other candidate\nlight shift wavelengths. For each wavelength, the top curve\nassumes initial 5D3/2 optical pumping fraction a\u22121/2 = 0.8,\nthe maximum typically observed while the bottom curve assumes a\u22121/2 = 0.51 which minimizes lineshape error. Dashes\nlines illustrate approximate bounds on \u03a9D /\u2206D that keep the\nline fitting relative error below 0.1%.\n\nrf, \u2206D /\u03a9D is also a measure of the vector light shift divided by the spin-flip linewidth.\nSince the sign of the error depends on both the sign\nof the light shift laser polarization and the sign of the\ncircular polarization used for state preparation, in principle the error can be cancelled by performing reversals\nof these parameters. While we did implement such reversals in the 1111 nm data set, the earlier runs using\n514 nm were not systematically controlled in this way.\nTherefore, for a consistent treatment, we have decided to\ncut data which our model suggests has a line fitting error\nof more than 0.1 %. In both data sets, this cut procedure\ndoes not end up shifting the reported R values by more\nthan the stated final precision.\nB.\n\nLaser misalignments, polarization errors\n\nOur experiment is designed to ideally measure only\nvector light shifts which are maximized in the case of pure\n\nH = HZeeman + HLight shift\n\uf8eb 3\n\u2032\n=\uf8ed\n\nFirst we will treat laser misalignments and polarization\nerrors following [27, 29].

When \u03b1 = 0,\n\u03c3 points along the direction of the main magnetic field\n\u1e91, and the quantity \u2206D defined in Eq. 6 exactly measures the vector light shift. But for \u03b1 6= 0, the light shift\nperturbation does not commute with the Zeeman Hamiltonian.

The first\nterm, linear in \u2206\u2032D however, is common to both \u2206D and\n\u2206S and therefore cancels in the ratio. We mechanically\nconstrain misalignment angles to below 5\u25e6 , verified by\nthe observed efficiency of optical pumping. Deviations\nfrom true perfect circular polarization are almost always\nless than 5%. For the typical \u2206D \u2248 10 kHz light shift\non a background magnetic field splitting \u03c9D \u2248 2.5 MHz,\nthe relative error due to Eq. 19 is less than 1 \u00d7 10\u22124 . A\nsimilar treatment of the tensor shift [27] mixed into \u2206D\nby a misaligned beam gives a similarly small error.

The slope diverges near atomic dipole resonances.\nIn regions with an expected relative error |R\u2032 | < 0.1 nm\u22121 , a\nlaser with free running stability of \u2206\u03bb = 0.01 nm contributes\na relative systematic error to the light shift ratio of 10\u22123 .\nThe region with low |R\u2032 | around 470 nm is in-between the\n6S1/2 \u2194 6P1/2 and 6S1/2 \u2194 6P3/2 transitions.\n\nprism we separated out and observed < 1 mW of pump\nlight emitting from the fiber. Any residual pump light\nthat did end up focused on the ion would not likely be\nwell circularly polarized since the polarizing elements we\nemploy are wavelength dependent. The purity and stability of the 514 nm laser is discussed elsewhere [16, 25].\nWe programmed the data acquisition system to monitor\nthe light shift beam power with a photodiode and halt\ndata taking in the case that the light shift power drifted\n5% above or below a set point. We employed active laser\nintensity control during the experiments at 514 nm.\n\n\u03bb0\n\nWe expect |R\u2032 | to become large only near Ba+ dipole\ntransitions. Using existing literature values for the barium reduced matrix elements, we plot this function in\nFigure 10. Examining it helps us determine the level\nof laser stability required at particular wavelengths. If a\ngiven laser can be stabilized to within \u2206\u03bb over the course\nof the experiment then the contribution to the expected\nrelative error in the reported light shift ratio is\n\u03c3\u03bb\n= |R\u2032 (\u03bb0 )|\u2206\u03bb.\nR\n\n1\n\n10\nLight-shift ratio derivative (1/nm)\n\n(18)\n\n2\n\n10\n\n(22)\n\nThe maximum drifts observed using a wavemeter over\nthe months spent collecting data were \u2206\u03bb = 0.001 nm\nand 0.01 nm for the 514.531 nm and 1111.68 nm lasers\nrespectively. We adjusted the wavelength of the Yb-fiber\nlaser at the beginning of each data run but made no\nattempt to actively stabilize it. The Yb-fiber laser is\npumped with high power 795 nm diode lasers.

Further, as shown in Figure 11, the\ndeviation scales with the trapping rf strength which confirms that rf currents at the trapping frequency \u03c9trap \u2248\n9.5 MHz generate an oscillating magnetic field of sufficient size to shift our single ion resonances.

This translates into systematic\nlight shift errors of \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22125 for the bulk of the data.\nThough this effect is well below the statistical sensitivity and dwarfed by other systematics, we attempted to\nsearch for any shift that scaled with \u03a9spin flip by taking\nspecial interleaved data runs differing only in spin-flip\nmagnitude by a factor of 25.\n\n(g-factor ratio - 2.505220) \u2022 (106)\n\n-100\n\n-150\n\n-200\n\n-250\n\n-300\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\nTrap power (W)\n\nFIG. 11: Data showing the measured g-factor ratio deviation\nwith trap rf strength.

We demonstrate that the largest relative\neffect these shifts have on the light shift ratio R is at\nthe 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 level but could be much worse if the trap\nrf is made nearly degenerate with any spin resonances,\nor if any light shift was large compared to the Zeeman\nsplittings.\n\nE.\n\nOn-resonant, rf Bloch-Siegert shift (i.e. from\nspin-flipping field)\n\nThe resonant spin-flip field is itself responsible for an\nac-Zeeman light shift through the Bloch-Siegert effect:\n\u2206\u03c90BS = +\n\n\u03a92spin flip\n.\n4\u03c90\n\n(26)\n\nThe effect would cancel in the light shift ratio if we\nprobed the light-shifted and unshifted resonances with\nthe same rf power. In practice we do not since the lightshifted resonances undergo a substantial amount of temporal noise, from fluctuating laser intensity or pointing,\n\nF.\n\nCorrelated magnetic field shifts\n\nAny change in the magnetic field correlated with the\nmeasurement of 6S1/2 versus 5D3/2 resonances vanishes\nentirely in the light-shift ratio. However, a change in\nB correlated with the application of the light shift laser\ndoes not cancel out. The only conceivable mechanism\nis a fluctuation of the magnetic field due to the actuation of the stepper-motor shutter gating the light shift\nlaser. We try to suppress any such effect with two layers\nof magnetic shielding, and by placing the shutter more\nthan 1 m from the trap with the solenoid aligned perpendicular to the quantization axis. A flux-gate magnetometer placed just outside the magnetic shielding showed no\nchange larger than 1 mG correlated with the light shift\nbeam shutter. Testing for any shift using the ion itself is\nstraightforward: leaving the light shift laser turned off,\nwe performed a typical light shift ratio data run with narrow \u03c9D resonances. During several dedicated scans, we\nfind that there are no apparent shutter-correlated shifts\nat the \u00b12 Hz level. The error would be correlated in both\n6S1/2 and 5D3/2 resonances and larger in the former by\nthe g-factor ratio of 2.5. We put limits on the error in R\ndue to this effect to \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 for 10 kHz type shifts.\nDespite being below the statistical sensitivity, we assign\nthis error estimate to each light shift run.\n\nG.\n\nSystematic ion displacements\n\nAny systematic shift in the ion's position due to the\napplication of the light shift laser will lead to a light shift\nratio error: a displaced ion experiences a different light\nintensity and magnetic field. Also, the dipole force on\nan ion in the 6S1/2 will be in principle different than\nwhen in the 5D3/2 state. Fortunately the rf trapping\nforce dwarfs these effects by many orders of magnitude.\nPrevious work [27] also treats systematic movement of\nthe ion trap loop and fluctuations of the pseudo-potential\ndue to application of the spin-flip rf: such mechanisms\ncontribute to a systematic shift at a level far below the\nother effects considered in this section.\n\n\f11\nVII.\n\nTHE EXTRACTION OF MATRIX\nELEMENTS\n\nAs a simple first step, we can turn our results into values for reduced dipole matrix elements, by solving for two\ndesired quantities in Eq. 9, using literature values of the\nother required dipole matrix elements as 'known' quantities. Performing this operation using literature values [8]\nyields\n|h5D3/2 ||er||6P1/2 i| = 3.14(8) ea0\n\n|h5D3/2 ||er||4F5/2 i| = 4.36(36) ea0,\n\nwhere the errors are due mainly to uncertainties in the\nliterature values. There are additional errors due to\nterms in Eq. 9 we have not included, such as core excitations and continuum states. The latter should contribute at the few percent level; studies of the dc-Stark\neffect in Ba+ [31] that imply the fractional effect of highn and continuum levels is \u2248 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 for 6S1/2 , m =\n\u00b11/2 states and \u2248 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22122 for 5D3/2 , m = \u00b11/2\n\n\u2217\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n\n[17]\n\nNow at Clarendon Laboratory, University of Oxford;\nElectronic address: jeff.sherman@gmail.com\nJ.
