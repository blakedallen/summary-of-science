It has been\nobserved by several authors that there is a link between freness of topological dynamical\nsystems and ideal intersection properties of C \u2217 -algebras (see e.g. Zeller-Meier [40], Effros,\nHahn [4], Elliott [5], Archbold, Quigg, Spielberg [1, 31, 32], Kawamura, Kishimoto,\nTomiyama [7, 8, 38]). A lot of attention has also been given the connection between\nminimality of topological dynamical systems and simplicity of the corresponding C \u2217 algebras (see e.g. [3], [30], [37], [38] and [39]). To be more precise, suppose that X\nis a topological space and s : X \u2192 X is a continuous function; in that case the pair\n(X, s) is called a topological dynamical system. A subset Y of X is called invariant if\ns(Y ) \u2286 Y . The topological dynamical system (X, s) is called minimal if there is no\ninvariant closed nonempty proper subset of X. An element x \u2208 X is called periodic\nif there is a positive integer n such that sn (x) = x; an element of X which is not\n\u2217\n\nAddress: University West, Department of Engineering Science, SE-46186 Trollh\u00e4ttan, Sweden, E-mail:\nPatrik.Lundstrom@hv.se\n\u2020\nAddress: Department of Mathematical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Universitetsparken 5,\nDK-2100 Copenhagen \u00d8, Denmark, E-mail: oinert@math.ku.dk\n\n1\n\n\f1 Introduction\nperiodic is called aperiodic. Recall that the topological dynamical system (X, s) is called\ntopologically free if the set of aperiodic elements of X is dense in X. Now suppose that\ns is a homeomorphism of a compact Hausdorff space X. Denote by C(X) the unital\nC \u2217 -algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on X endowed with the supremum\nnorm, pointwise addition and multiplication, and pointwise conjugation as involution.\nThe map \u03c3s : C(X) \u2192 C(X) which to a function f \u2208 C(X) associates f \u25e6 s \u2208 C(X) is\nthen an automorphism of C(X). The action of \u03c3s on C(X) extends in a unique way to\na strongly continuous representation \u03c3 : Z \u2192 Aut(C(X)) subject to the condition that\n\u03c3(1) = \u03c3s , namely \u03c3(k) = \u03c3sk , for k \u2208 Z. In that case, the associated transformation\ngroup C \u2217 -algebra C \u2217 (X, s) can be constructed (see e.g. [2] or [29] for the details). In 1978\nPower showed the following elegant result connecting simplicity of C \u2217 (X, s) to minimality\nof s.\nTheorem 1 (Power [30]). If s is a homemorphism of a compact Hausdorff space X of\ninfinite cardinality, then C \u2217 (X, s) is simple if and only if (X, s) is minimal.\nInspired by Theorem 1, the second author of the current article has in [18] and [27]\nshown analogous results (see Theorem 2) relating properties of an arbitrary topological\ndynamical system (X, s), where s is a group homomorphism from a group G to Aut(X),\nto ideal properties of the skew group algebra C(X) \u22ca\u03c3 G. For more details concerning\nskew group algebras, and, more generally, skew category algebras, see Section 2.\nTheorem 2 (\u00d6inert [18] and [27]). Suppose that X is a compact Hausdorff space and\ns : G \u2192 Aut(X) is a group homomorphism. Consider the following three assertions:\n(i) C(X) \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple;\n(ii) s is minimal;\n(iii) s is faithful.\nThe following conclusions hold:\n(a) (i) implies (ii) and (iii);\n(b) if G is an abelian group, then (i) holds if and only if (ii) and (iii) hold;\n(c) if G is isomorphic to the additive group of integers and X has infinite cardinality,\nthen (i) holds if and only if (ii) holds.\nFor related results concerning the ideal structure in skew group algebras and, more\ngenerally, group graded rings and Ore extensions, see [22], [23] [24], [25], [26], [33], [34]\nand [35].\nA natural question is if there is a version of Theorem 2 that holds for dynamics defined\nby families of partial functions on a space, that is functions that do not necessarily have\nthe same domain or codomain. In this article we address this question by using the\nmachinery developed by the authors in [11] for category dynamical systems. These are\ndefined by families, stable under composition, of continuous maps between potentially\n\n2\n\n\f1 Introduction\ndifferent topological spaces. We show a generalization of Theorem 2 to the case of skew\ncategory algebras defined by these maps and spaces (see Theorem 3 below). To be more\nprecise, suppose that G is a category. The family of objects of G is denoted by ob(G);\nwe will often identify an object in G with its associated identity morphism. The family\nof morphisms in G is denoted by mor(G); by abuse of notation, we will often write n \u2208 G\nwhen we mean n \u2208 mor(G). Throughout the article G is assumed to be small, that is\nwith the property that mor(G) is a set. The domain and codomain of a morphism n in G\nis denoted by d(n) and c(n) respectively. We let G(2) denote the collection of composable\npairs of morphisms in G, that is all (m, n) in mor(G) \u00d7 mor(G) satisfying d(m) = c(n).\nFor each e \u2208 ob(G), let Ge denote the collection of n \u2208 mor(G) with d(n) = c(n) = e. Let\nGop denote the opposite category of G. We let Top denote the category having topological\nspaces as objects and continuous functions as morphisms. Suppose that s : G \u2192 Topop\nis a (covariant) functor; in that case we say that s is a category dynamical system. If G is\na groupoid, that is a category where all morphisms are isomorphisms, then we say that\ns is a groupoid dynamical system1 . If e \u2208 ob(G), then we say that an element x \u2208 s(e)\nis periodic if there is a nonidentity n : e \u2192 e in G such that s(n)(x) = x; an element\nof s(e) which is not periodic is called aperiodic. We say that s is topologically free if for\neach e \u2208 ob(G), the set of aperiodic elements of s(e) is dense in s(e). We say that s is\nminimal if for each e \u2208 ob(G), there is no nonempty proper closed subset Y of s(e) such\nthat s(n)(Y ) \u2286 Y for all n \u2208 Ge . We say that s is faithful if for each e \u2208 ob(G), and each\nnonidentity n \u2208 Ge , there is x \u2208 s(e) such that s(n)(x) 6= x. For each e \u2208 ob(G), we let\nC(e) denote the set of continuous complex valued functions on s(e). For each n \u2208 G the\nfunctor s induces a map \u03c3(n) : C(d(n)) \u2192 C(c(n)) by the relation \u03c3(n)(f ) = f \u25e6 s(n),\nfor f \u2208 C(d(n)). If we use the terminology introduced in Section 2, then the map \u03c3\ndefines a skew category system (see Definition 4). In the same section, we show how one\nto each skew category system may associate a so called skew category algebra A \u22ca\u03c3 G\n(see also [19] for a more general construction) where A = \u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e). In Section 2, we\nobtain two results concerning simplicity of a general skew category algebra A \u22ca\u03c3 G. (see\nProposition 11 and Proposition 14). These results are applied to category dynamical\nsystems in Section 3, where we show the following generalization of Theorem 2 from\ngroups to categories.\nTheorem 3. Let s : G \u2192 Topop be a category dynamical system with the property that\nfor each e \u2208 ob(G), the space s(e) is compact Hausdorff. Consider the following four\nassertions:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(i) \u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple;\n(ii) G is inverse connected;\n\n(iii) s is minimal;\n(iv) s is faithful.\n1\n\nThe notion groupoid dynamical system is in the C \u2217 -algebra literature used in a sense different from\nours, see e.g. [12] and [13].\n\n3\n\n\f2 Simple Skew Category Algebras\nThe following conclusions hold:\n(a) (i) implies (ii), (iii) and (iv);\n(b) if G is a locally abelian groupoid, then (i) holds if and only if (ii), (iii) and (iv)\nhold;\n(c) if G is a groupoid with the property that for each e \u2208 ob(G) the space s(e) is infinite\nand the group Ge is isomorphic to Z, then (i) holds if and only if (ii) and (iii) hold.\nVarious types of crossed product algebras associated to groupoid dynamical systems,\nand even more general types of dynamical systems, have appeared in the literature before\n(see e.g. [6, 12, 13, 28]). The difference between these algebras and our algebras is that,\ngenerally speaking, our skew category algebras are defined in an algebraic way, without\nmaking use of any topology. For example, by choosing A to be a C \u2217 -algebra and our\ncategory G to be a locally compact group acting on A, we may form the skew category\nalgebra A \u22ca\u03c3 G, and also the standard crossed product C \u2217 -algebra appearing in e.g. [36].\nThe relation between these two algebras is that the skew category algebra sits as a dense\nsubalgebra inside the crossed product C \u2217 -algebra.\n\n2 Simple Skew Category Algebras\nIn this section, we first recall the definitions of skew category systems (A, G, \u03c3) and skew\ncategory algebras A \u22ca\u03c3 G from [11] (see Definition 4 and Definition 6). Thereafter, we\nshow two results concerning simplicity of skew category algebras and properties of skew\ncategory systems (see Proposition 11 and Proposition 14). These results will be applied\nto category dynamical systems in Section 3.\nConventions on rings. Let R be an associative ring. The identity map R \u2192 R is\ndenoted by idR . If R is unital then the identity element of R is nonzero and is denoted\nby 1R . The category of unital rings is denoted by Ring. We say that a subset R\u2032 of\nR is a subring of R if it is itself a ring under the binary operations of R. We always\nassume that ring homomorphisms between unital rings respect the identity elements.\nIf A is a subset of R, then the commutant of A in R is the set of elements of R that\ncommute with every element of A. If A is a commutative subring of R, then A is called\nmaximal commutative in R if the commutant of A in R equals A. All ideals of rings are\nsupposed to be two-sided. By a nontrivial ideal we mean a proper nonzero ideal. If R\nis commutative and x \u2208 R, then Ann(x) denotes the ideal of R consisting of all y \u2208 R\nsatisfying xy = 0. If G is a monoid of endomorphisms of a ring A, then we say that a\nsubset B of A is G-invariant if for every g \u2208 G the inclusion g(B) \u2286 B holds. The ring\nA is called G-simple if there is no nontrivial G-invariant ideal of A.\nConventions on categories. Let G be a category. Recall that G is called connected\nif its underlying undirected graph is connected. Note that if G is a groupoid, then\nG is connected precisely when there to each pair e, f \u2208 ob(G), is n \u2208 mor(G) with\nd(n) = e and c(n) = f . We say that G is locally a group (locally abelian) if each\n\n4\n\n\f2 Simple Skew Category Algebras\nmonoid Ge , for e \u2208 ob(G), is a group (abelian). We say that G is inverse connected\nif given e, f \u2208 ob(G), there are m, n \u2208 mor(G) with d(m) = c(n) = f and mn = e.\nNote that if G is both inverse connected and locally a group, then G is a groupoid. A\ncongruence relation R on G is a collection of equivalence relations Re,f on hom(e, f ), for\ne, f \u2208 ob(G), chosen so that if (m, m\u2032 ) \u2208 Re,f and (n, n\u2032 ) \u2208 Rf,g , then (mn, m\u2032 n\u2032 ) \u2208 Re,g ,\nfor all e, f, g \u2208 ob(G). If e, f \u2208 ob(G) and n \u2208 hom(e, f ), then we let [n] denote the\nequivalence class in hom(e, f ) defined by Re,f . Suppose that H is another category and\nthat F : G \u2192 H is a functor. The kernel of F , denoted ker(F ), is the congruence relation\non G defined by letting (m, n) \u2208 ker(F )e,f , for e, f \u2208 ob(G), whenever m, n \u2208 hom(e, f )\nand F (m) = F (n). Recall that ker(F ) is called trivial if for each e, f \u2208 ob(G), ker(F )e,f\nis the equality relation on hom(e, f ). We say that ker(F ) is locally trivial if for each\ne \u2208 ob(G), ker(F )e,e is the equality relation on hom(e, e).\nDefinition 4. By a skew category system we mean a triple (A, G, \u03c3) where G is a\n(small) category, A is the direct sum of unital rings Ae , for e \u2208 ob(G), and \u03c3 is a functor\nG \u2192 Ring satisfying \u03c3(n) : Ad(n) \u2192 Ac(n) , for n \u2208 G.\nRemark 5. Suppose that (A, G, \u03c3) is a skew category system. The fact that \u03c3 is a\nfunctor G \u2192 Ring can be formulated in terms of maps by saying that\n\u03c3(e) = idAe\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c3(m)\u03c3(n) = \u03c3(mn)\n\n(2)\n\nfor all e \u2208 ob(G), and\nfor all (m, n) \u2208 G(2) .\nDefinition 6. If (A, G, \u03c3)Pis a skew category system, then we let A \u22ca\u03c3 G denote the\ncollection of formal sums n\u2208G an un , where an \u2208 Ac(n) , n \u2208 G, are chosen so that all\nbut finitely many of them are nonzero.

It is clear that these operations define a ring\nstructure on A \u22ca\u03c3 G. We call A \u22ca\u03c3 G the skew category algebra defined by (A, G, \u03c3).\nOften we let un denote 1Ac(n) un for all n \u2208 G.\n\n5\n\n\f2 Simple Skew Category Algebras\nRemark 7.

Suppose that T := A \u22ca\u03c3 G is a skew category algebra. If we for each n \u2208 G,\nput Tn = Ac(n) un , then T = \u2295n\u2208G Tn , Tm Tn = Tmn , for (m, n) \u2208 G(2) , and Tm Tn = {0},\notherwise. In the terminology of [9], [10], [20] and [21] this means that a skew category\nalgebra is a strongly category graded ring.\nProposition 9. If A \u22ca\u03c3 G is a skew category algebra and I is an ideal of A \u22ca\u03c3 G, then\n(a) the equality I = A \u22ca\u03c3 G holds if and only the equality I \u2229 Ae = Ae holds for all\ne \u2208 ob(G);\n(b) if G is inverse connected, then the equality I = A \u22ca\u03c3 G holds if and only if the\nequality I \u2229 Ae = Ae holds for some e \u2208 ob(G).\nProof. Let R denote A \u22ca\u03c3 G.\n(a) The \"only if\" statement is clear. Now we show the \"if\" statement. Suppose that\nfor every e \u2208 ob(G) the equality I \u2229 Ae = Ae holds. Take x \u2208 R. From the definition of\nskew category algebras it follows that there is a finite subset X of ob(G) satisfying\n!\nX\n(5)\nue = x.\nx\ne\u2208X\n\nP\nP\nP\nBut e\u2208X ue \u2208 e\u2208X Ae = e\u2208X I \u2229 Ae \u2286 I which, by equation (5), implies that x \u2208 I.\nSince x was arbitrarily chosen from R, we get that I = R.\n(b) The \"only if\" statement is clear. Now we show the \"if\" statement. Suppose that\nI \u2229 Ae = Ae for some e \u2208 ob(G). Take f \u2208 ob(G). By (a) we are done if we can show\nthat I \u2229Af = Af . Since G is inverse connected, there are m, n \u2208 G with d(m) = c(n) = e\nsuch that f = mn. But then uf = um ue un \u2208 I \u2229 Af . This implies that I \u2229 Af = Af .\nProposition 10. Let A \u22ca\u03c3 G be a skew category algebra. Suppose that R is a congruence\nrelation\ncontained in ker(\u03c3). If I is the two-sided ideal in A\u22ca\u03c3 G generated by an element\nP\nn\u2208mor(G) an un , where an \u2208 Ac(n) , for n \u2208 mor(G), with an = 0 for all but finitely many\nn \u2208 mor(G),\nsatisfying an = 0 if n does not belong to any of the classes [e], for e \u2208 ob(G),\nP\nand n\u2208[e] an = 0, for e \u2208 ob(G), then A \u2229 I = {0}. In particular, if A \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple,\nthen ker(\u03c3) is locally trivial.\n\n6\n\n\f2 Simple Skew Category Algebras\nProof. See the proof of [19, Proposition 9].\nProposition 11. Let A \u22ca\u03c3 G be a skew category algebra. Consider the following five\nassertions:\n(i) A \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple;\n(ii) G is inverse connected;\n(iii) for each e \u2208 ob(G), the ring Ae is Ge -simple;\n(iv) for each e \u2208 ob(G), the ring Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) is a field;\n(v) ker(\u03c3) is locally trivial.\nThe following conclusions hold:\n(a) (i) implies (ii)-(v);\n(b) if G is a locally abelian groupoid, then (i) holds if and only if (ii)-(v) hold.\nProof. Let R denote A \u22ca\u03c3 G.\n(a) Suppose that (i) holds. We first show (ii). Take e, f \u2208 ob(G). Let I denote the\nideal generated by ue in R. Since R is simple it follows that I = R. In particular, we get\nthat uf \u2208 I. Since I consists of the set of finite sums of the form xue y, where x, y \u2208 R,\nit follows that there exist m, n \u2208 mor(G) with d(m) = c(n) = e such that uf = um ue un .\nThis implies that f = mn and hence that G is inverse connected. Now we show (iii).\nTake e \u2208 ob(G) and a nonzero Ge -invariant ideal Je of Ae . Let I denote the ideal of R\ngenerated by Je ue . Since R is simple we get that I = R. This implies in particular that\nue \u2208 I. Then ue \u2208 I \u2229 Ae ue = Je ue which implies that 1Ae \u2208 Je . Hence Je = Ae . Now\nwe show (iv). Let e \u2208 ob(G). Take a nonzero x in Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) and let I be the ideal of\nR generated by x. Since I is nonzero and R is simple, we get that I = R. In particular,\nue equals a finite sum of elements of the form yxz where y, x \u2208 Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge . But since x\nbelongs to Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) we get that ue = wx = xw for some w \u2208 Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge . All that is\nleft to show now is that w \u2208 Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ). Take v \u2208 Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge . Then, since x commutes\nwith v, we get that wv = wvue = wvxw = wxvw = ue vw = vw. Assertion (v) follows\nimmediately from Proposition 10.\n(b) From (a) it follows that we only need to show the \"if\" statement. Suppose that\n(i)-(v) hold. Let I be a nonzero ideal of R. Then there is a nonzero element x =\nP\nn\u2208mor(G) an un in I, where an \u2208 Ac(n) , for n \u2208 mor(G) and an = 0 for all but finitely\nmany n \u2208 mor(G),\nP with the property that ae 6= 0 for some e \u2208 ob(G). Indeed, take\na nonzero y = m\u2208mor(G) bm um in I. We now consider two cases. Case 1: There is\nn \u2208 mor(G) with d(n) = c(n) and bn 6= 0. Then x = yun\u22121 has the desired property\nwhere e = c(n). Case 2: There is n \u2208 mor(G) with d(n) 6= c(n) and bn 6= 0. Since G is\ninverse connected it follows that there are m, p \u2208 mor(G) with d(m) = c(n), c(p) = d(p)\nand mp = c(n). Then x = yu(nm)\u22121 has the desired property where e = c(n). Let J be\nthe ideal of Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge consisting of all b \u2208 Ae such that there are bn \u2208 Ae , for n \u2208 Ge \\{e},\n\n7\n\n\f2 Simple Skew Category Algebras\nwith the property that bn \u2208 A\nPe , for n \u2208 Ge \\ {e}, where bn = 0 for all but finitely many\nn \u2208 Ge \\ {e}, and y := b + n\u2208Ge \\{e} bn un \u2208 ue Iue and Supp(y) \u2286 Supp(x). By the\nabove discussion concerning the element x it follows that J is nonzero. Now we show\nthat J is Ge -invariant. Take m \u2208 Ge . Then, since Ge is abelian, it follows that\nX\nX\n\u03c3(m)(bn )un .\num bun um\u22121 = \u03c3(m)(b) +\nI \u220b um yum\u22121 = um bum\u22121 +\nn\u2208Ge \\{e}\n\nm\u2208Ge \\{e}\n\nTherefore, \u03c3(m)(b) \u2208 J. By Ge -simplicity of Ae it follows that J P\n= Ae . In particular,\nwe can choose y so that b = 1Ae . Among all nonzero elements z = n\u2208Ge cn un \u2208 ue Iue ,\nwith cn = 0 for all but finitely many n \u2208 Ge , choose an element minimizing | Supp(z)|.\nBy the above discussion, we can assume that ce = 1 for such an element z. Now we show\nthat z \u2208 Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ). Take a \u2208 Ae and m \u2208 Ge . Then, since Ge is abelian, it follows\nthat\nX\n(a\u03c3(m)(cn ) \u2212 cn \u03c3(n)(a)) umn .\naum z \u2212 zaum =\nn\u2208Ge\n\nSince\n\na\u03c3(m)(ce ) \u2212 ce \u03c3(e)(a) = a\u03c3(m)(1Ae ) \u2212 1Ae a = a1Ae \u2212 1Ae a = a \u2212 a = 0\nwe get that | Supp(aum z \u2212 zaum )| < | Supp(z)|. Since aum z \u2212 zaum \u2208 ue Iue , we get,\nby minimality of | Supp(z)|, that aum z \u2212 zaum = 0. Therefore z \u2208 Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ). Since\nZ(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) is a field and z is nonzero, it follows that z is invertible in Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge and\nhence that ue Iue = Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge . In particular I \u2229 Ae = Ae . Simplicity of A \u22ca\u03c3 G now\nfollows directly from Proposition 9(b).\nProposition 12. Let A \u22ca\u03c3 G be a skew category algebra with A commutative. Consider\nthe following two assertions:\n(i) if I is a nonzero ideal of A \u22ca\u03c3 G, then I \u2229 A 6= {0};\n(ii) the subring A is maximal commutative in A \u22ca\u03c3 G.\nThe following conclusions hold:\n(a) (i) implies (ii);\n(b) (ii) does not imply (i) for all categories G;\n(c) if G is a groupoid, then (i) holds if and only if (ii) holds.\nProof. See the proof of [11, Proposition 2.3].\nRemark 13. For other results related to the implication (i) implies (ii) in Proposition\n12, see [19]. The implication (ii) implies (i) in Proposition 12 actually holds for all\nnondegenerate groupoid graded rings, see [20].\nProposition 14. Let A \u22ca\u03c3 G be a skew category algebra with A commutative. Consider\nthe following six assertions:\n\n8\n\n\f3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\n(i) A \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple;\n(ii) G is inverse connected;\n(iii) for each e \u2208 ob(G), the ring Ae is Ge -simple;\n(iv) for each e \u2208 ob(G), the ring Z(Ae \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) is a field;\n(v) ker(\u03c3) is locally trivial.\n(vi) A is maximal commutative in A \u22ca\u03c3 G.\nThe following conclusions hold:\n(a) (i) implies (ii)-(vi);\n(b) if G is a groupoid, then (i) holds if and only if (ii)-(vi) hold.\nProof. Let R denote A \u22ca\u03c3 G.\n(a) Suppose that (i) holds. By Proposition 11(a) we get that (ii)-(v) hold. It follows\nfrom Proposition 12(a) that (vi) holds.\n(b) Suppose that G is a groupoid. By (a) we only need to show the \"if\" statement.\nSuppose that (ii)-(vi) hold. We show (i). Let I be a nonzero ideal\nP of R. By Proposition\n12(b), we get that I \u2229 A is a nonzero ideal of A. Since I \u2229 A = e\u2208ob(G) I \u2229 Ae , there is\ne \u2208 ob(G) such that I \u2229 Ae is a nonzero ideal of Ae . Take n \u2208 Ge . From the fact that G\nis a groupoid, we get that there is m \u2208 Ge such that nm = e. Then\nn(I \u2229 Ae )ue = \u03c3(n)(I \u2229 Ae )unm = \u03c3(n)(I \u2229 Ae )un um = un (I \u2229 Ae )um \u2286\n\u2286 (un Ium ) \u2229 un Ae um \u2286 I \u2229 \u03c3(n)(Ae )un um \u2286 (I \u2229 Ae )unm = (I \u2229 Ae )ue .\nHence un (I \u2229 Ae ) \u2286 I \u2229 Ae and thus I \u2229 Ae is also Ge -invariant. By Ge -simplicity of Ae\nthis implies that I \u2229 Ae = Ae . By Proposition 9(b), we get that I = R.\n\n3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 3. To this end, we need a result from [11] (see Proposition 15) concerning topological freeness and maximal commutativity. We shall also need\nthree results (see Proposition 17, Proposition 19 and Proposition 20) relating minimality\nof category dynamical systems to simplicity of the corresponding skew category algebras.\nIn the end of this section, we discuss the implications of these results for the connection\nbetween dynamical systems defined by partially defined functions (see Definition 24) and\nproperties of the corresponding skew category algebras (see Examples 26 and 28).\nLet s : G \u2192 Topop be a category dynamical system. Then (\u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e), G, \u03c3) is a\nskew category system. Indeed, we need to check conditions (1) and (2) from Remark 5.\nTake e \u2208 ob(G) and f \u2208 C(e). Then \u03c3(e)(f ) = f \u25e6s(e) = f. Therefore \u03c3(e) = idC(e) . Take\n(m, n) \u2208 G(2) and f \u2208 C(d(n)). Then \u03c3(m)\u03c3(n)(f ) = \u03c3(m)(f \u25e6 s(n)) = f \u25e6 s(n) \u25e6 s(m) =\nf \u25e6 (s(m) \u25e6op s(n)) = f \u25e6 s(mn) = \u03c3(mn)(f ). Therefore \u03c3(m)\u03c3(n) = \u03c3(mn). Hence, we\nmay form the skew category algebra (\u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e)) \u22ca\u03c3 G.\n\n9\n\n\f3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\nProposition 15. Suppose that s : G \u2192 Topop is a groupoid dynamical system. If for each\ne \u2208 ob(G) the space s(e) is locally compact Hausdorff, then the following two assertions\nare equivalent:\n(i) s is topologically free;\n(ii) the subring \u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e) is maximal commutative in [\u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e)] \u22ca\u03c3 G.\nProof. See the proof of [11, Theorem 3.2].\nLemma 16. Suppose that X and Y are topological spaces and A \u2286\n\u0001 X and B \u2286 Y . If\nf : X \u2192 Y is a continuous function such that f (A) \u2286 B, then f A \u2286 B.\nProof. The inclusion f (A) \u2286 B can equivalently\nbe stated as the inclusion A \u2286 f \u22121 (B).\n\u0001\nSince f is continuous we\u0001get that f \u22121 B is a \u0001closed subset of X containing A and hence\nalso A, i.e. A \u2286 f \u22121 B or equivalently f A \u2286 B.\n\nProposition 17. If s : G \u2192 Topop is a minimal category dynamical system such that for\neach e \u2208 ob(G) the topological space s(e) is infinite and Hausdorff and Ge is isomorphic\nto the additive group of integers, then s is topologically free and, hence, faithful.\nProof. Take e \u2208 ob(G). We will show that every point in s(e) is aperiodic, which,\nof course, implies that the set of aperiodic points in s(e) is dense. Take x \u2208 s(e).\nThen Ge (x) is a nonempty Ge -invariant subset of s(e). By Lemma 16 the set Ge (x)\nis a nonempty closed Ge -invariant subset of X, which, since s is minimal, implies that\nGe (x) = s(e). Since s(e) is infinite and Hausdorff it follows that Ge (x) is infinite. Let g\nbe a generator for Ge . Seeking a contradiction, suppose that there is a nonzero integer\nN such that s(gN )(x) = x. Then the cardinality of Ge (x) is less than or equal to |N |.\nThis contradicts the fact that Ge (x) is an infinite set. Therefore, s(gN )(x) 6= x, for all\nnonzero integers N , and hence x is an aperiodic point in s(e).\nRecall that a topological space X is called completely regular if given any closed proper\nsubset F of X, there is a nonzero continuous complex valued function on X that vanishes\non F .\nLemma 18. Every compact Hausdorff topological space is completely regular.\nProof. See any standard book on point set topology, e.g. [14].\nProposition 19. Suppose that s : G \u2192 Topop is a category dynamical system with\neach s(e), for e \u2208 ob(G), compact Hausdorff. If for each e \u2208 ob(G), the ring C(e) is\nGe -simple, then s is minimal.\nProof. We show the contrapositive statement. Suppose that s is not minimal. Then\nthere is e \u2208 ob(G) such that s(e) is not Ge -minimal, that is there is a closed nonempty\nproper Ge -invariant subset Y of s(e). Define IY to be the set of f \u2208 C(e) that vanish on\nY . It is clear that IY is a Ge -invariant proper ideal of C(e). By Lemma 18, it follows\nthat IY is also nonzero. Therefore, C(e) is not Ge -simple.\n\n10\n\n\f3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\nProposition 20. Suppose that s : G \u2192 Topop is a category dynamical system with each\ns(e), for e \u2208 ob(G), compact. If s is minimal, then for each e \u2208 ob(G), the ring C(e) is\nGe -simple.\nProof. We show the contrapositive statement. Suppose that there is e \u2208 ob(G) such that\nC(e) is not Ge -simple. Then there is a T\nnontrivial Ge -invariant ideal I of C(e). For a\nsubset J of C(e), let NJ denote the set f \u2208J f \u22121 ({0}). We claim that NI is a closed,\nnonempty proper Ge -invariant subset of C(e). If we assume that the claim holds, then s\nis not minimal and the proof is done. Now we show the claim. Since I is Ge -invariant the\nsame is true for NI . Since I is nonzero it follows that NI is a proper subset of s(e). Since\neach set f \u22121 ({0}), for f \u2208 I, is closed, the same is true for NI . Seeking a contradiction,\nsuppose that NI is empty. Since C(e)P\nis compact, P\nthere is a finite subset J of I such\n2\nthat NJ = NI . Then the function F = f \u2208J |f | = f \u2208J f f belongs to I and, since NJ\nis empty, it has the property that F (x) 6= 0 for all x \u2208 s(e). Therefore 1e = F * F1 \u2208 I,\nwhere 1e denotes the constant map s(e) \u2192 C which sends each element of s(e) to 1. This\nimplies that I = C(e) which is a contradiction. Therefore NI is nonempty.\nProposition 21. If s : G \u2192 Topop is a category dynamical system with each s(e), for\ne \u2208 ob(G), compact Hausdorff, then s is faithful if and only if ker(\u03c3) is locally trivial.\nProof. Suppose that s is not faithful. Then there is e \u2208 ob(G) and a nonidentity n \u2208 Ge\nsuch that s(n) = ids(e) . This implies that \u03c3(n) = idC(e) and hence that \u03c3 is not locally\ntrivial.\nSuppose that \u03c3 is not locally trivial. Then there is e \u2208 ob(G) and a nonidentity n \u2208 Ge\nsuch that \u03c3(n) = idC(e) . This implies that f (s(n)(x)) = f (x) for all f \u2208 C(e) and all\nx \u2208 s(e). By Urysohn's lemma (see any standard book on point set topology, e.g. [14]),\nthe set of continuous complex valued functions on a compact Hausdorff space separates\npoints. Hence, we get that s(n)(x) = x for all x \u2208 s(e). Therefore s is not faithful.\nProof of Theorem 3. Let R denote [\u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e)] \u22ca\u03c3 G.\n(a) Suppose that R is simple. By Proposition 11(a) it follows that G is inverse connected and that each C(e), for e \u2208 ob(G), is Ge -simple. By Proposition 19, this implies\nthat s is minimal. By Proposition 11(a) again it follows that ker(\u03c3) is locally trivial. By\nProposition 21 we get that s is faithful.\n(b) By (a) we only need to show the \"if\" statement. Suppose that G is a locally\nabelian inverse connected groupoid and that s is minimal and faithful. We show that R\nis simple. By Proposition 20 it follows that each C(e), for e \u2208 ob(G), is Ge -simple and\nby Proposition 21 we conclude that ker(\u03c3) is locally trivial. Take e \u2208 ob(G). We claim\nthat Z(C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) is a field. If we assume that the claim holds, then, by Proposition\n11(b), it follows that R is simple. Now we show the claim. We will in fact show that\nZ(C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) = C where we identify a complex number z with the constant function\n1z in C(e) that maps each element of s(e) to z. It isPclear that Z(C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) \u2287 C. Now\nwe show the inclusion Z(C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) \u2286 C. Take n\u2208Ge fn un \u2208 Z(C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) where\nfn \u2208 C(e), for n \u2208P\nG(e), and f\u0001n = 0 P\nfor all but finitely\nmany n \u2208 Ge . For every m \u2208 Ge ,\n\u0001\nu\nholds.\nFrom the fact that Ge is\nf\nu\n=\nf\nu\nthe equality um\nm\nn\u2208Ge n n\nn\u2208Ge n n\n11\n\n\f3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\nabelian, we get that fn (s(m)(x)) = fn (x), for m, n \u2208 Ge and x \u2208 s(e). For every n \u2208 Ge\nchoose a complex number zn in the image of fn . Since fn \u25e6 s(m) = fn it follows that the\nset fn\u22121 (zn ) is a nonempty Ge -invariant closed subset of s(e). Since s is minimal it follows\nthat fn\u22121 (zn ) = s(e) and hence that fn = 1zn , for n \u2208 Ge . Take a nonidentity m \u2208 Ge .\nFrom the fact that s is faithful, we get that there is a \u2208 s(e) such that s(m)(a) 6= a.\nSince P\nC(e) separates the points in s(e) there is g \u2208 C(e) such that g(a) 6= g(s(m)(a)).\nSince n\u2208Ge 1zn un commutes with g we get that 1zm (x)(g(x) \u2212 \u03c3(m)(g)(x)) = 0 for all\nx \u2208 s(e). By specializing this equality with x = a, we get that zm (g(a) \u2212 g(s(m)(a)) = 0\nwhich in turn implies that zm = 0. Therefore, the inclusion Z(C(e) \u22ca\u03c3 Ge ) \u2286 C holds.\n(c) We can show this in two ways. Either, we use Theorem 3(b) and the faithful part\nof Proposition 17, or we can construct a direct proof (similar to the proof of (b) above)\nusing Proposition 14, the topologically free part of Proposition 17 and Proposition 15.\n\u0003\nRemark 22. If we omit the condition that s is faithful, then the conditions (ii) and (iii)\nin Theorem 3 do not necessarily imply that [\u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e)] \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple. In fact, let\nG and H be any nontrivial groups. By abuse of notation, we let e denote the identity\nelement of both groups. Suppose that X is a compact Hausdorff space equipped with\na minimal G-action G \u00d7 X \u220b (g, x) 7\u2192 g(x) \u2208 X. Define an action of G \u00d7 H on\nX by the relation G \u00d7 H \u00d7 X \u220b (g, h, x) 7\u2192 g(x) \u2208 X; this action is also minimal.\nThen C(X) \u22ca\u03c3 (G \u00d7 H) is not simple. In fact, let I be the ideal generated by the\nset of elements of the form u(e,e) \u2212 u(e,h) , for h \u2208 H. Define the homomorphism of\nabelian groups \u03c6 : C(X) \u22ca\u03c3 (G \u00d7 H) \u2192 C(X) by the additive extension of the relation\n\u03c6(f u(g,h) ) = f , for g \u2208 G, h \u2208 H and f \u2208 C(X). We claim that I \u2286 ker(\u03c6). If we\nassume that the claim holds, then I is a nontrivial ideal of C(X) \u22ca\u03c3 (G \u00d7 H), since\n\u03c6|C(X) = idC(X) . Now we show the claim. By the definition of I it follows that it is\nenough to show that \u03c6 maps elements of the form f1 u(r,s) (u(e,e) \u2212 u(e,h) )f2 u(t,v) to zero,\nwhere f1 , f2 \u2208 C(X), r, t \u2208 G and s, h, v \u2208 H. However, since \u03c3(e, h)(f2 ) = f2 , we get\nthat f1 u(r,s) (u(e,e) \u2212 u(e,h) )f2 u(t,v) = f1 \u03c3(r, s)(f2 )(u(rt,sv) \u2212 u(rt,shv) ) which, obviously, is\nmapped to zero by \u03c6.\nRemark 23. If we omit the condition that G is locally abelian in Theorem 3, then the\nconditions (ii), (iii) and (iv) do not necessarily imply that [\u2295e\u2208ob(G) C(e)] \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple.\nIndeed, \u00d6inert has given an example of this phenomenon when G is the nonabelian group\nof homeomorphisms of the circle S 1 acting on the compact Hausdorff space S 1 (for the\ndetails, see [27, Example 6.1]).\nDefinition 24. Suppose that X is a topological space. By a partially defined dynamical\nsystem on X we mean a collection P of functions such that:\n\u2022 if f \u2208 P , then the domain d(f ) of f and the codomain c(f ) of f are subsets of X\nand f is continuous as a function d(f ) \u2192 c(f ) where d(f ) and c(f ) are equipped\nwith the relative topologies induced by the topology on X;\n\u2022 if f \u2208 P , then idd(f ) \u2208 P and idc(f ) \u2208 P ;\n\n12\n\n\f3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\n\u2022 if f, g \u2208 P are such that d(f ) = c(g), then f \u25e6 g \u2208 P .\nWe say that an element x of X is periodic with respect to P if there is a nonidentity\nfunction f in P with d(f ) = c(f ) and f (x) = x. An element x is aperiodic with respect to\nP if it is not periodic. We say that P is topologically free if the set of aperiodic elements\nof X is dense in X. We say that P is minimal if for every Y \u2286 X, satisfying Y = d(g)\nfor some g \u2208 P , there is no nonempty proper closed subset S \u2286 Y such that f (S) \u2286 S\nfor all f \u2208 P satisfying d(f ) = c(f ) = Y . We say that P is faithful if given a nonidentity\nfunction f \u2208 P with d(f ) = c(f ), then there is x \u2208 d(f ) such that f (x) 6= x. By abuse of\nnotation, we let P denote the category having the domains and codomains of functions in\nP as objects and the functions of P as morphisms. We let the obvious functor P \u2192 Top\nbe denoted by tP . Let GP denote the opposite category of P and let sP : GP \u2192 Topop\ndenote the opposite functor of tP . We will call sP the category dynamical system on X\ndefined by the partially defined dynamical system P .\nProposition 25. If X is a topological space and P is a partially defined dynamical system\non X, then P is topologically free (minimal, faithful) if and only if sP is topologically free\n(minimal, faithful) as a category dynamical system.\nProof. This follows immediately from the definition of topological freeness (minimality,\nfaithfulness) of P and sP .\nTo illustrate the above definitions and results, we end the article with some concrete\nexamples of partially defined dynamical systems.\nExample 26. Suppose that we let X denote the real numbers equipped with its usual\ntopology and we let Y denote the set of nonnegative real numbers equipped with the\nrelative topology induced by the topology on X. Let sqr : X \u2192 Y and sqrt : Y \u2192 X\ndenote the square function and the square root function, respectively. Furthermore, let\nabs : X \u2192 X denote the absolute value. Let P be the partially defined dynamical system\nwith ob(P ) = {X, Y } and mor(P ) = {idX , idY , sqr, sqrt, abs}. Then we get the following\ntable of partial composition for P\nidX idY sqr sqrt abs\n\u25e6\nidX idX\n\u2217\n\u2217 sqrt abs\n\u2217\nidY sqr\n\u2217\n\u2217\nidY\n\u2217\n\u2217 idY sqr\nsqr sqr\nsqrt \u2217 sqrt abs\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217 sqrt abs\nabs abs\nPut G = P op and let AX and AY denote the set of continuous complex valued functions\n\u2032 , g , g \u2032 , h , h\u2032 \u2208 A\n\u2032\n\u2032\non X and Y respectively. Take fX , fX\nX X\nX\nX and fY , fY , gY , gY \u2208 AY .\nX\nThen the product of\nB1 := fX uidX + gX uabs + hX usqr + fY uidY + gY usqrt\nand\n\u2032\n\u2032\nuabs + h\u2032X usqr + fY\u2032 uidY + gY\u2032 usqrt\nuidX + gX\nB2 := fX\n\n13\n\n\f3 Minimal and Faithful Category Dynamical Systems\nin the skew category algebra A \u22ca\u03c3 G equals\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nB1 B2 = f X f X\nuidX + fX gX\n+ gX (fX\n\u25e6 abs) + gX (gX\n\u25e6 abs) + hX (gY\u2032 \u25e6 sqr) uabs +\n\u0001\n\u0001\n+ fX h\u2032X + hX (fY\u2032 \u25e6 sqr) + gX (h\u2032X \u25e6 abs) usqr + fY fY\u2032 + gY (h\u2032X \u25e6 sqrt) uidY +\n\u0001\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+ fY gY\u2032 + gY (fX\n\u25e6 sqrt) + gY (gX\n\u25e6 sqrt) usqrt .\n\nNow we examine the properties (i)-(iv) in Theorem 3.\nProperty (i) is false. Indeed, the ideal I of A \u22ca\u03c3 G generated by uabs equals\nAX uabs + AX usqr + AY usqrt .\n\nHence I is a nontrivial ideal of A \u22ca\u03c3 G, which, in particular, implies that A \u22ca\u03c3 G is not\nsimple.\nBy direct inspection of the table of partial composition for P it follows that property\n(ii) is false.\nProperty (iii) is false. In fact, if we let S be any subset of the set of the non-negative\nreal numbers, then abs(S) = S. Hence P is not minimal.\nProperty (iv) is true. Indeed, the only nonidentity function in P that has equal domain\nand codomain is abs. But abs(x) = \u2212x 6= x for any negative real number.\nRemark 27. It can be shown (see [11, Example 28] for the details) that the partially\ndefined dynamical system in Example 26 is not topologically free.\nExample 28. Let X denote a set equipped with the discrete topology. We now consider\ntwo partially defined dynamical systems P on X.\n(a) Let P be the partially defined dynamical system on X having one-element subsets\nof X as objects and the unique functions between such sets as morphisms. Now we\nexamine the properties (ii), (iii) and (iv) in Theorem 3. It is clear that P is a locally\nabelian inverse connected (small) groupoid so (ii) holds. By the definition of P it follows\ndirectly that it is both minimal and faithful. Therefore, by Theorem 3, we get that\nA \u22ca\u03c3 G is simple. We leave it as an exercise to the reader to show that A \u22ca\u03c3 G is\nisomorphic as a complex algebra to the direct limit lim MY (C), where the direct limit is\n\u2212\u2192\ntaken over finite subsets Y of X and we let MY (C) denote the complex subalgebra of\nA \u22ca\u03c3 G generated by elements of the form um for m \u2208 mor(P ) with d(m), c(m) \u2208 Y .\nThe maps MY (C) \u2192 MY \u2032 (C), for finite subsets Y and Y \u2032 of X with Y \u2286 Y \u2032 , defining\nthe direct limit, are defined by sending un , for n \u2208 P with d(n), c(n) \u2208 Y , to un . If X\nis a finite set of cardinality n, then it is clear that lim MY (C) is isomorphic to the ring\n\u2212\u2192\nMn (C) of n \u00d7 n complex matrices. In particular, we now retrieve simplicity of Mn (C).\n(b) Let P be the partially defined dynamical system on X consisting of all subsets of\nX as objects and all maps between such sets as morphisms. Then P is a small category\nwhich is not a groupoid. Now we examine the properties (i)-(iv) in Theorem 3. It is\neasy to see that P is not topologically free. By Proposition 15 and Proposition 14 we\nconclude that A \u22ca\u03c3 G is not simple, so (i) is false. By choosing e, f \u2208 ob(G) (i.e. subsets\nof X) of different cardinality, it is easy to see that P is not inverse connected, so (ii) is\nfalse. It is clear that P is minimal and faithful, so (iii) and (iv) are true.\n\n14\n\n\fReferences\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe second author was partially supported by The Swedish Research Council (postdoctoral fellowship no. 2010-918) and The Danish National Research Foundation (DNRF)\nthrough the Centre for Symmetry and Deformation.\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
