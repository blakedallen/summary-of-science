Motivated by classical physical\nlaws such as Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell's electrodynamics, in this work we add the restrictive postulate\nthat the observables of macroscopic objects are evolved continuously through space and time. Quantum theory\nviolates both macroscopic realism and the continuity assumption. While decoherence or collapse models (e.g.\ndue to a universal noise background or gravitational self energy) can restore macroscopic realism, we show\nthat a continuous spatiotemporal description does not become possible in general. This shines new light on the\nquestion how the classical world arises out of the quantum realm.\n\nClassical laws, as they are formulated in mechanics or electrodynamics, (i) give a continuous spatiotemporal evolution\nof a system's properties and (ii) also are in agreement with the\ntheory-independent concept of macroscopic realism (macrorealism) [1]. For example, the position or angular momentum\nof a macroscopic body evolve continuously in space and time\nas governed by classical laws in the form of certain differential equations. These physical properties are macrorealistic,\ni.e. they can be assumed to exist prior to observation and to be\nnot influenced by them. The predictions of quantum mechanics violate macrorealism. Decoherence is the mechanism by\nwhich-through interaction with an environment-the nondiagonal terms of a system's density matrix are suppressed,\nturning quantum states into statistical mixtures [2]. We show\nthat, although decoherence can establish macrorealism, it does\nnot necessarily lead to a continuous spatiotemporal evolution\nof macroscopic variables.\nMacrorealism (MR) bases on three postulates [3]:\n\"(1) Macrorealism per se. A macroscopic object\nwhich has available to it two or more macroscopically distinct states is at any given time in a definite one of those states.\n(2) Non-invasive measurability. It is possible in\nprinciple to determine which of these states the\nsystem is in without any effect on the state itself\nor on the subsequent system dynamics.\n(3) Induction. The properties of ensembles are\ndetermined exclusively by initial conditions (and\nin particular not by final conditions).\"\nThese assumptions allow to derive the so called LeggettGarg inequality for temporal correlations, whose violation\nindicates the non-classicality of a macroscopic object [4].\nNotwithstanding recent achievements that could demonstrate\nquantum interference in large systems [5], the high experimental demands for a demonstration of the violation of macrorealism have not been achieved yet.\nOne can distinguish various levels of \"classicality\" for a\nmacroscopic physical system. The most abstract level is the\n\nMacrorealism\nMacrorealism & continuity\nClassical physics\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online.) Illustration of the different levels of classicality: \"Macrorealism\" (MR) in the Leggett-Garg definition, \"Macrorealism and continuity\" (MR&C) as put forward in this work, and\n\"Classical physics\" with concrete laws of motion.\n\npostulation that systems obey the Leggett-Garg inequality and\nmacrorealism (MR). We now introduce the more restrictive\nnotion of classicality as the conjunction of macrorealism and\ncontinuity (MR&C). MR&C bases on the three postulates of\nMR as well as on a fourth one:\n(4) Continuity. The observables of macroscopic\nobjects evolve continuously through space and\ntime.\nNotwithstanding MR&C represents a narrower class of theories than MR, continuity is a natural assumption because\neven the allegedly discrete and abrupt events in the physical\nworld like the result of a dice toss stem from a continuous\nevolution of all objects through space and time.\nThe most restrictive level is classical physics itself where\nsystems obey concrete laws such as Newton's or Maxwell's\nequations. While it is clear that validity of classical physics\nimplies validity of MR&C but not the opposite, we will show\nthat the theory sets obey the strict relation \"Classical physics \u2282\nMR&C \u2282 MR\". This is illustrated in Figure 1 and has interesting consequences for the quantum-to-classical transition, as\nwe will present a situation where due to environmental decoherence (or collapse models [6]) MR is fulfilled but MR&C is\nnot. Since decoherence is extremely hard to avoid, our results\nshould be interpreted as a chance for experiments to demonstrate a certain level of non-classicality despite the action of\ndecoherence.\n\n\f2\nIn Refs. [7, 8] it was demonstrated that the Leggett-Garg\ninequality can always be violated under sharp measurements\neven for arbitrarily large systems, using as an example a quantum spin- j. However, one can speak about a violation of\nmacrorealism only if sufficiently coarse-grained \"classical\"\nmeasurements are employed which distinguish macroscopically distinct states. Under coarse-grained measurements, one\ncan distinguish between two types of time evolutions. For\nthe set of \"classical\" Hamiltonians, the temporal correlations\nsatisfy macrorealism and even obey classical laws of motion.\nHowever, there exist \"non-classical\" Hamiltonians which allow to violate macrorealism even under coarse-grained measurements. Essentially, they need to build up macroscopic superpositions in time. In this paper, we show that decoherence\nvalidates MR. However, whether or not non-classical Hamiltonians lead to a violation of MR&C depends on the concrete\nmodel of decoherence. Sufficiently strong thermal (dissipative) environments may establish the validity of MR&C, while\neven arbitrarily strong dephasing (non-dissipative) environments are not able to accomplish that.\nWe now introduce the basic mathematical concepts for\nthe further analysis. The (normalized and positive) Qdistribution of a quantum spin- j state \u03c1\u0302 is given by [9] Q(\u03a9) \u2261\n2 j+1\n4\u03c0 h\u03a9|\u03c1\u0302|\u03a9i with |\u03a9i the spin coherent states [10]. In a\ncoarse-grained spin measurement, the whole unit sphere is\ndecomposed into a number of mutually disjoint angular regions \u03a9k where the (polar and azimuthal) angular size of these\nregions, \u2206\u0398, has to be much larger \u221athan the inverse square\ncoarseroot of the spin length j: \u2206\u0398 \u226b 1/ j. A (POVM)\n!\nj+1\n|\u03a9ih\u03a9|\nd2 \u03a9\ngrained measurement with elements P\u0302k \u2261 24\u03c0\n\u03a9k\nfinds out in which of these coarse-grained \"slots\" the quanP\ntum system is ( k P\u0302k = 11) [8]. The outcome k is found\nwith probability wk = Tr[\u03c1\u0302P\u0302k ] or just via integration over\nthe Q-distribution,\nrepresenting a classical ensemble of spins:\n!\nwk = \u03a9 Q(\u03a9) d2 \u03a9. This reflects macrorealism per se.\nk\nUpon measurement the state \u03c1\u0302 is reduced to \u03c1\u0302k =\nM\u0302k \u03c1\u0302 M\u0302k\u2020 /wk , with M\u0302k the Kraus operators obeying M\u0302k\u2020 M\u0302k =\nj+1\nh\u03a9|\u03c1\u0302k |\u03a9i.\nP\u0302k . Its corresponding Q-distribution is Qk = 24\u03c0\nExcept near slot borders the Q-distribution before measurement is the (weighted) mixture of the Q-distributions of the\nP\npossible reduced states \u03c1\u0302k [8]: Q(\u03a9) \u2248 k wk Qk (\u03a9).\nThe time evolution of the system obeys the Leggett-Garg\ninequality and macrorealism, if the Q-distribution at any time\nt j without prior measurements is approximately the same as\nthe weighted mixture (over all possible outcomes k) of the Qdistributions that resulted from an intermediate measurement\nat any time ti (ti < t j ) and then evolved to t j [8]:\nX\nQ(\u03a9, t j ) \u2248\nwk,ti Qk,ti (\u03a9, t j )\n(1)\nk\n\nThis is the necessary and sufficient condition for macrorealism, as it incorporates both macrorealism per se and noninvasive measurability (together with induction). If it is fulfilled, the Leggett-Garg inequality follows [8]. We will use\nthis condition and not the Leggett-Garg inequality to test\nmacrorealism. Under non-classical Hamiltonians we under-\n\nstand those that violate eq. (1), and an example is (in units\nwhere ~ = 1)\n\u0124 = i \u03c9 (|\u2212 jih+ j| \u2212 |+ jih\u2212 j|) .\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u03c9 is the precession frequency and |+ ji (|\u2212 ji) is the\neigenstate of the spin- j operator's z-component with maximal (minimal) eigenvalue, or equivalently, the coherent state\npointing to the north (south). (For states of light, nonlinear\nmedia may be used to implement similar interactions [11].)\nStarting from the initial state along north, i.e. |\u03a8(0)i = |+ ji,\nthe Hamiltonian (2) produces an oscillating macroscopic superposition state\n|\u03a8(t)i = cos(\u03c9t) |+ ji + sin(\u03c9t) |\u2212 ji .\n\n(3)\n\nThe spin effectively behaves as a two-level system, albeit its\ntwo states are macroscopically distinct. Given that the spin\nitself is isolated, coarse-grained measurements or the fact that\nonly measurement apparatuses couple to an environment [2]\ndo not prevent a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality and\nmacrorealism [8]. But what happens if the system itself is continuously monitored by an environment?\nGiven the Hamiltonian (2) with the time evolution operator \u00dbt = exp(\u2212i\u0124t) = cos(\u03c9t) (|+ jih+ j|+|\u2212 jih\u2212 j|) +\nP j\u22121\nsin(\u03c9t) (|\u2212 jih+ j|\u2212|+ jih\u2212 j|) + m=\u2212\nj+1 |mihm|, let us approximate the effects of (dephasing) system decoherence by the\nfollowing simplified model: The initial state along north,\n\u03c1\u0302(0) = |+ jih+ j|, freely evolves without decoherence a short\ntime \u2206t to\n\u03c1\u0302(\u2206t) = cos2 (\u03c9\u2206t) |+ jih+ j| + sin2 (\u03c9\u2206t) |\u2212 jih\u2212 j| + c.t.\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the coherence terms \"c.t.\" are of the form |+ jih\u2212 j| and\n|\u2212 jih+ j|. Now we assume that the macroscopic spin system\n(e.g. say j \u223c 1023 ) decoheres very rapidly (in the standard\npointer basis of |+ ji and |\u2212 ji), for instance due to the fact\nthat a single qubit from the environment couples to it in a\ncontrolled-not interaction [2], becomes inaccessible immediately afterwards, and does not interact (recohere) with it anymore. If it is impossible to make (joint) measurements on the\nenvironmental qubit (and our spin system), the partial trace\nover the qubit of the total density matrix has to be performed,\nwhich kills the coherence terms in eq. (4), leading to the decohered state of the system: \u03c1\u0302(\u2206t) = cos2 (\u03c9\u2206t) |+ jih+ j| +\nsin2 (\u03c9\u2206t) |\u2212 jih\u2212 j|. Repeating the alternating sequence of free\ntime evolution and rapid decoherence, we obtain the general\nexpression for the (decohered) state at time n\u2206t:\n\u03c1\u0302(n\u2206t) = An |+ jih+ j| + (1\u2212An) |\u2212 jih\u2212 j| .\n\n(5)\n\nThe survival probability to find the state along north, An , can\nbe retrieved from the recurrence relation An = c An\u22121 + (1 \u2212\nc) (1\u2212 An\u22121) with integer n, c \u2261 cos2 (\u03c9\u2206t), and A0 = 1. If \u2206t\nis not too small (to avoid a quantum Zeno-like freezing of the\ninitial state [12] in this model) but smaller than the dynamical\ntimescale of the Hamiltonian, \u03c9\u22121 , the probability An decays\nto A\u221e = 12 in a way which can be very well approximated by\nA(t) =\n\n1\n2\n\n(1 + e\u2212\u03bdt )\n\n(6)\n\n\f3\nwith \u03bd \u2248 2 sin2 (\u03c9\u2206t)/\u2206t the characteristic decay rate. For\ntimes t \u226b \u03bd\u22121 the state asymptotically approaches an equal\nweight statistical mixture \u03c1\u0302(\u221e) = 21 (|+ jih+ j| + |\u2212 jih\u2212 j|). (In\ncontrast, the probability to find the state along north, i.e. |+ ji,\nat time t if no environmental decoherence takes place is given\nby cos2 (\u03c9t), where this characteristic cosine-law allows to violate the Leggett-Garg inequality.)\nAs we will see below, the results of this simple model are\ngeneric for the wide class of exact decoherence models with\ndephasing environments. The environmental microscopic degrees of freedom drive the system into a mixture, but it does\nnot leave the subspace spanned by |+ ji and |\u2212 ji, and never\npopulates any of the other spin z-component eigenstates. The\nparticular decay form (6) of the survival probability is expected to hold very well in all cases where the characteristic\ndecoherence time \u03c4dec , suppressing off-diagonal elements in a\ndensity matrix, is fast compared to the dynamical timescale of\nthe Hamiltonian (2), i.e. whenever \u03c4dec \u226b \u03c9\u22121 .\nLet us now investigate what this means for the violation of\nthe Leggett-Garg inequality. We use eq. (5) in its continuous\nform, i.e. \u03c1\u0302(t) = A(t) |+ jih+ j| + [1 \u2212 A(t)] |\u2212 jih\u2212 j|, with A(t)\nthe survival probability. If no (coarse-grained) measurement\ntakes place, the spin's Q-distribution at time t j -i.e. the lefthand side of eq. (1)-is given by\nQ(t j ) = A(t j ) Qnorth + [1\u2212A(t j)] Qsouth ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Qnorth (Qsouth ) is the Q-distribution of a spin pointing\nto the north (south). If a measurement takes place at the intermediate time ti (0 < ti < t j ), the weighted mixture of the\nreduced and evolved Q-distributions-i.e. the right-hand side\nof eq. (1)-reads\n{A(ti ) A(t j \u2212ti ) + [1 \u2212 A(ti )] [1 \u2212 A(t j \u2212ti )]} Qnorth\n+ {A(ti ) [1 \u2212 A(t j \u2212ti )] + [1 \u2212 A(ti )] A(t j \u2212ti )} Qsouth .\n\n(8)\n\nWithout loss of generality, we can set A(t) = 21 [1 + a(t)]\nwith some function a(t) such that A(t) is always between 0\nand 1. We then find that the non-invasiveness-condition (1),\ni.e. the equality of (7) and (8), translates into the condition\na(t j ) = a(ti ) a(t j \u2212 ti ). This is fulfilled if and only if a(t) has\nthe form e\u2212\u03bdt , where the solution with negative \u03bd is excluded\nbecause a(t) must always be between \u22121 and +1. This means\nthat the only allowed form of A(t) is eq. (6). Therefore, in all\ndecoherence models producing an exponential decay of the\nsurvival probability-and only in those-the system's time\nevolution under the Hamiltonian (2) fulfills the condition (1)\nfor non-invasive measurability, and consequently macrorealism is satisfied.\nHowever, in the case of non-classical Hamiltonians, dephasing decoherence (and therefore collapse models due to a\nuniversal noise background or gravitational self energy which\nalso have only a dephasing effect [6]) cannot account for\na continuous spatiotemporal description of the macroscopic\nspin variables. To see this, it is enough to use coarse-grained\nmeasurements corresponding to only three different angular\n\nHiL Dephasing environment\n\nHiiL Thermal environment\n\nP\n\nP\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-j\n\n0\n\nj\n\nmz\n\n0\n-j\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-j\n\n0\n\nj\n\nmz\n\n0\n-j\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-j\n\n0\n\nj\n\nmz\n\n0\n-j\n\n0\n\nj\n\n0\n\nj\n\n0\n\nj\n\nmz\n\nmz\n\nmz\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online.)

According to eq. (5), the\ninitial spin along north can be found pointing to the south at\nsome later time, although it did not go through the equatorial region. No classical Hamilton function can achieve such\ndiscontinuous \"jumps\" of a spin vector.\nThe key point here is that in classical physics as well as in\nMR&C we have differential equations for observable quantities such as spin directions. Under all circumstances, these\nequations evolve the observables continuously through real\nspace and time. In quantum mechanics, however, the situation is very different. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation evolves the\nstate vector continuously through Hilbert space and, under\nnon-classical Hamiltonians, one cannot give a continuous spatiotemporal description of the coarse-grained (macroscopic)\nobservables, even if macrorealism itself is valid.\nIn the last part, we will investigate two decoherence models\nin detail, using numerical solutions of the Lindblad master\nequation [13, 14]:\n\u0011\n1X \u0010\nd\n[L\u0302k \u03c1\u0302, L\u0302\u2020k ] + [L\u0302k , \u03c1\u0302L\u0302\u2020k ] , (9)\n\u03c1\u0302(t) = \u2212i [\u0124, \u03c1\u0302] \u2212\nk\ndt\n2\nwith the Lindblad operators L\u0302k . We assume the spin- j system\n\n\f4\nto consist of N = 2 j spin- 21 particles and consider\n\u0124 =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c9 (\u03c3\u0302+1 \u03c3\u0302+2 . . . \u03c3\u0302+N \u2212 \u03c3\u0302\u22121 \u03c3\u0302\u22122 . . . \u03c3\u0302\u2212N ),\n\nMacroscopic\nquantum systems\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is, up to a constant factor, the Hamiltonian (2).

(i) In the first case, similar to the scenario above,\nthe Lindblad operator corresponds to a local dephasing [14]:\nPN\nL\u0302dp = i=1\n\u03b3dp \u03c3\u0302+i \u03c3\u0302\u2212i . (ii) In the second case, a thermal enviPN\nronment is modeled by [14] L\u0302th = 12 i=1\n\u03b3th [(n\u0304+1) \u03c3\u0302\u2212i \u2212 n\u0304 \u03c3\u0302+i ].\nThe coupling parameter for the case of dephasing is set to\n\u03b3dp = 1 so that the Lindblad and the Hamiltonian part in the\nmaster equation are of the same order. The average number\nof excitations n\u0304 in the thermal environment is proportional to\nthe temperature. We considered the case when n\u0304 \u226b 1 and the\ncoupling is such that \u03b3th n\u0304 = 1. The evolutions for the two\ncases were computed up to the times that are needed to approximately reach the corresponding stationary distributions.\nFor the reasons of numerical convenience, the master equation\n(9) was solved using solutions of an equivalent stochastic nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the quantum trajectories in the\nsystem's Hilbert space of pure states. The particular form of\nthe stochastic equation that we have used is the one given by\nthe theory of quantum state diffusion [15], but other forms of\nequivalent stochastic equations or the direct solutions of (9)\nwould give the same results. The evolution of the expectations for an arbitrary observable is then given by averaging\nover many stochastic trajectories (103 in our computation).\nThe results of the numerical computations are illustrated in\nthe histograms in Figure 2. We took N = 2 j = 10 spin- 21 particles, initially all with spin along z, and computed the values\nPN z\n\u03c3\u0302i .\nof the (dimensionless) magnetization along z, m\u0302z = 12 i=1\nThe possible domain of outcomes mz \u2208 [\u2212 j, j] is divided into\nintervals and the probability P that, without any intermediate\nmeasurement, mz is in one of the intervals at a particular time\nis shown. The two columns correspond to snapshots at successive moments in the dimensionless time \u03c9t with dephasing\n(left column) and thermal decoherence (right column). Apparently, the evolution of mz under decoherence by dephasing is\ndiscontinuous in the sense that intermediate intervals between\nnorth and south are never populated. As in the simple model\nabove, eq. (5), the environment just kills off-diagonal terms in\nthe density matrix. On the other hand, the strong thermal environment actively perturbs the diagonal elements of the matrix\nand produces a continuous evolution and therefore in principle allows a continuous spatiotemporal description in terms of\nclassical laws of motion.\nConclusion.-Figure 3 gives an overview regarding the\nquantum-to-classical transition. The introduction of the concept macrorealism and continuity (MR&C) in this work is at\nleast of twofold significance: First, it opens up the chance for\nexperiments to demonstrate a certain level of non-classicality\ndespite the action of decoherence. Second, it shows that the\ncollapse models which have been put forward to forbid macroscopic quantum effects [6] are insufficient on their own, as-\nlike dephasing-they only destroy superpositions but would\n\ncoarse-grained\n\nMicroscopic\nquantum systems\nType of\nmeasurements\n\nsharp\nViolation of\nLeggett-Garg ineq.\n\nclassical\nMacrorealism &\nclass. laws of motion\n\nSystem\nHamiltonian\n\nnon-classical\n\nNo macrorealism\nthermal ?\n\nMacrorealism &\ncontinuous spatiotemporal evolution\n\ndephasing\n\nEnvironmental\ndecoherence\n\nMacrorealism but\nno continuous spatiotemporal evolution\n\nFIG. 3: (Color online.) Microscopic systems as well as macroscopic\nsystems under sharp measurements allow to violate the Leggett-Garg\ninequality [7, 8]. Since no macroscopic (coarse-grained) \"classical\" observables are involved, one cannot speak about a violation of\nmacrorealism in these cases. Under coarse-grained measurements of\na macroscopic system and classical Hamiltonians not only macrorealism is valid but also classical laws of motion can emerge [7]. Nonclassical Hamiltonians-building up macroscopic superpositions in\ntime-allow to violate macrorealism even under coarse-grained measurements [8]. In this work, we have shown that decoherence then\nestablishes macrorealism but that for dephasing environments it cannot account for a continuous spatiotemporal description of the evolution of macroscopic observables. Whether thermal environments can\nachieve such a description in general remains an open question.\n\nnot in general ensure a continuous evolution of macroscopic\nproperties.\nThis work was supported by the Austrian Science Foundation FWF (SFB, Project No. P19570-N16, and CoQuS), the\nEuropean Commission through Project QAP (No. 015846),\nWUS Austria, \u00d6AD, and the Serbian Ministry of Science\n(Contract No. 141003).\n\n[1] A.
