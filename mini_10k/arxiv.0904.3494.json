Muller et al. (1963) and\nothers have identified clumps of H I emission with motions that are inconsistent with Galactic\nrotation. Formally, these high velocity clouds (HVCs) are identified by either having a line of\nsight velocity, |vLSR |, greater than 90 km s\u22121 with respect to the local standard of rest or else\ndiffer from the rotational velocity of the disk by greater than 50 km s\u22121 at a given Galactic longitude (Wakker & van Woerden 1997). Despite over 40 years of study, the origin of these HVCs\nremains a mystery. Our position within the Milky Way's disk provides a unique perspective of\ntheir spatial distribution. However, because the clouds do not obey Galactic rotation, distance\nmeasurements rely on the serendipitous position of stars and stellar spectroscopy to find distance\nbrackets (e.g. Thom et al. 2006, 2007; Wakker et al. 2007, 2008) or other coincidences, such as the\nassociation of the Magellanic Stream with the Magellanic Clouds, or the interaction of Smith's\nCloud (Lockman et al. 2008) and the Magellanic Stream (McClure-Griffiths et al. 2008) with the\nGalactic Disk. Other HVCs may be tidal debris (e.g. Lockman 2003, Putman et al. 2004). Such\ncoincidences yield distances to individual HVCs of order 10 kpc, but are quite rare and tell us\nlittle about the population as a whole. Accurate distances to H I clouds allow us to calculate\ntheir masses and to map their positions about the Galaxy and thereby differentiate between several\nHVC formation scenarios, which in turn have implications for cosmology and structure formation,\nchemical enrichment, and halo dynamics.\nTo explain the pervasive structure of Galactic HVCs across the sky, one must invoke multiple\nexplanations. The Magellanic Stream is likely the result of tidal interactions with the Large and\nSmall Magellanic Clouds. For other HVCs, Shapiro & Field (1976) and Bregman (1980) postulated\nthat a galactic fountain mechanism could be responsible for raising hot gas into the Galactic halo\nwhere it would cool, condense, and then rain back down on the disk. Meanwhile, Oort (1970)\nproposed that these H I clouds are primordial left-overs that are just now being accreted by the\nMilky Way. This theory was revived recently by Blitz et al. (1999) and Braun & Burton (1999)\nwho suggested that some types of HVCs were associated with low mass dark matter halos seen in\nmodels of \u039bCDM galaxy formation (Klypin et al. 1999). HVCs may also be produced by a cooling,\ncondensing hot halo (e.g. Maller & Bullock 2004, Fukugita & Peebles 2006, Sommer-Larsen 2006,\nPeek et al. 2008). These theories have different predictions for the mass distribution, the vertical\ndistance from the disk, and the metallicity for the clouds (see Wakker & van Woerden 1997, and\nreferences therein). But in either case, their presence would not be unique to our own Galaxy: in\norder to gain insight into the Galactic HVC population we observe other nearby spiral galaxies.\nAs the closest large spiral galaxy to the Milky Way, M 31 is an excellent test bed in which\nto search for HVC analogs. Thilker et al. (2004) find \u223c 20 discrete objects within 50 kpc of the\nM 31 disk which range in H I mass between 105 and 107 M\u2299 and can be characterized by a steep\npower law distribution. The authors suggest that these clouds may trace the dark matter halos\naround M 31 that are predicted from \u039bCDM models. However, many of the clouds show velocity\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\ncontinuity implying that they may be tidal remnants associated with the stellar stream of M 31,\nor part of the H I bridge between M 31 and M 33 (Westmeier et al. 2005).\nObserving edge-on galaxies reveals the vertical distribution of gas. The first, and subsequently,\nthe most well studied galaxy for extraplanar H I is the edge-on spiral NGC 891 (e.g. Swaters et al.\n1997). The deepest published observations probe to H I masses of 9.3 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 and a column\ndensity of 1.6 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 (Oosterloo et al. 2007). These observations show that NGC 891 has a\nlarge H I halo that extends vertically out to 14 kpc from the thin H I disk and, in one quadrant, out\nto 22 kpc, contributing nearly 30% of the total H I mass of the galaxy. This halo is characterized\nby differential rotation, but it lags behind the rotation of the disk by 15 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . Studies\nof NGC 891 and other nearly edge-on galaxies imply that there is a significant link between the\namount of star formation in the disk (as measured by H\u03b1 or radio continuum), and the properties\nof the lagging halo, which is believed to be evidence for gas circulation by a galactic fountain\n(Swaters et al. 1997, Heald et al. 2006a,b, 2007). In general, they find that the scale height and\nthe velocity gradient decrease with increasing star formation rate. Unfortunately, observations of\nedge-on galaxies are unable to tell us about either the position of clouds around the disk, or their\nvertical motion-the latter of which plays a part in identifying HVCs in the Milky Way.\nIn face-on galaxies H I at anomalous velocities and H I holes may be the result of gas accretion (e.g. M 101; van der Hulst & Sancisi 1988) or massive star formation (e.g. NGC 628;\nKamphuis & Briggs 1992). The mass and morphology of clouds are frequently used to discriminate\nbetween high velocity complexes that are likely to be in-falling extragalactic gas versus galactic\nfountain gas energized by supernovae. In the case of accretion, the gas tends to be located in the\nouter portions of the galaxy and is more massive. In the star formation case, the gas clouds tend\nto have lower masses and are associated with regions of H\u03b1 or UV emission, or H I holes (e.g.\nBoomsma et al. 2008). The largest H I holes in M 101 may be the result of recent collisions with\nextragalactic clouds; supernovae are ruled out because of the energy requirement to account for the\namount of H I removed from the disk, and there is no evidence from UV or radio continuum data\nto support extraordinary star formation activity (van der Hulst & Sancisi 1988). NGC 6946 has an\nH I plume and large scale asymmetries probably related to tidal encounters (Kamphuis & Sancisi\n1993; Boomsma et al. 2008), as well as high-velocity gas and holes related to star formation. From\nthe mass in the high velocity gas, Kamphuis & Sancisi (1993) estimate a SN rate of 1 per 100 years\nto feed a galactic fountain, which is roughly consistent with the six SNe that have been observed\nin the galaxy this century.\nInclined galaxies have the benefits of both edge-on and face-on observations. One can distinguish the presence of extraplanar H I gas that lags behind the rotation of the disk and identify\nanomalous velocity gas with some sense of its location with respect to the disk while, at the same\ntime, look for sites of active star formation that would be obscured in edge-on galaxies. There are a\nnumber of good examples of this. Position-velocity (hereafter p-v) slices of NGC 2403 show H I gas\nabove and below the thin disk rotating 25 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 slower (Schaap et al. 2000; Fraternali et al.\n2002), analogous to the extra-planar gas in NGC 891. Furthermore, channel maps show counter-\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nrotating gas (Fraternali et al. 2001, 2002). In other examples, an asymmetry in the distribution of\ndiffuse gas in NGC 253 is evidence for merger or accretion activity (Boomsma et al. 2005). Meanwhile H\u03b1 emission, from star formation activity, is correlated with high velocity gas in NGC 6822\n(de Blok & Walter 2006). H I holes have been observed in NGC 4559 that are attributed to supernova explosions or stellar winds (Barbieri et al. 2005).\nIn order to better understand the origin of HVCs in the Milky Way and those seen around\nM 31, it is essential to observe a number of galaxies with similar properties that are well-situated for\ndetailed study. NGC 2997 is the largest spiral galaxy in the loose galaxy group, LGG 180 (Garcia\n1993). This galaxy group was one of six observed by Pisano et al. (2007) in a Parkes survey of\nnearby Local Group analogs to search for intra-group HVC candidates. No HVC analogs were\nfound in any of the groups down to a mass limit . 107 M\u2299 . We chose NGC 2997 for deep, high\nresolution observations because of its similarities to the Milky Way and M 31 in mass, luminosity,\nand star formation rate. It is a relatively isolated galaxy (no known companions within 110 kpc),\nit is moderately inclined with respect to the line of sight (\u223c 33\u25e6 ), and it has with a well behaved\nrotation curve. NGC 2997 was also chosen because it cannot be confused with Galactic or Local\nGroup H I emission. Given a healthy star formation rate, it would not be surprising to find evidence\nfor a lagging H I disk; its inclination allows us to investigate the position and kinematics of clouds\nwith respect to the galactic disk in simple rotation. With these observations we identify extraplanar\nH I and HVC analogs associated with galactic fountains, galaxy formation, and tidal debris and\nuse the characteristics of such HVCs to discriminate between their possible origins.\nThe observations of NGC 2997 and data reduction are described in Section 2. The resulting data are described in Section 3 including the results from modelling each H I component in\nNGC 2997. In Section 4 we consider possible origins of the extraplanar gas of the thick disk and\nthe anomalous velocity H I clouds, and compare the H I in NGC 2997 to that of other galaxies.\nWe also derive the star formation rate and distance of NGC 2997, and discuss how it affects the\nconstraints on the origins of HVCs. We conclude in Section 5.\n\n2.\n\nObservations & Data Reduction\n\nIn January 2006, we observed NGC 2997 with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA)\nfor 28 hours in the EW682 configuration. These observations were in addition to archival ATCA\ndata (from project C453) for NGC 2997 taken during 1995 and 1996, amounting to a total of\n59 hours in 6 different configurations (Table 1). The data were flagged and calibrated using the\nstandard procedures in Miriad (Sault & Kileen 2008). From 15-26 January 2007, we observed\nthe galaxy for a total of 61 hours in 7-8 hour blocks with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope\n(GMRT). The GMRT is comprised of 30 antennas in a fixed \"Y\"-configuration with 14 antennas\nwithin 1 km and a maximum baseline of 25 km. The data were flagged and calibrated in AIPS\nat the GMRT using the standard procedures. Each night was individually imaged and inspected\nbefore being combined to create our final data cube. All observations were taken at a velocity\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nTable 1: Summary of ATCA Observations\nDate\n1995 Oct 27\n1995 Nov 7\n1995 Dec 15\n1996 Jan 21\n1996 Jan 23\n1996 Feb 22\n2006 Jan 7\n2006 Jan 8\n2006 Jan 9\n\na\n\nConfiguration/\nObserving\nMax Baseline (m)a Time (hrs)\n1.5D/1439 (4439)\n10\n6A/2923 (5939)\n14\n6C/2786 (6000)\n13\n750C/750 (5020)\n12\n750B/765 (4500)\n11\n1.5C/1485 (4500)\n9\nEW352/352 (4439)\n8.5\nEW352/352 (4439)\n8.5\nEW352/352 (4439)\n11\n\nMaximum separation between antennas, excluding (and including) the 6 km antenna.\n\nresolution of 6.596 km s\u22121 .\nTo combine the data, the reduced GMRT observations were written out of AIPS and read into\nMiriad 1 . The visibility data were combined in Miriad with the task UVAVER, and cleaned using\nthe task MOSSDI. We imaged 120 channels centered on the galaxy using a robustness of 2 and\ndown-weighted the longest baselines from the GMRT. We derive a distance to NGC 2997 of 12.2\nMpc using published 2MASS Tully-Fisher relations (Masters et al. 2008) that we adopt throughout\nthe paper. Discussion of this derivation is left to the Section 4.3 in order to not take away from\nthe focus of this paper on the H I properties of the galaxy. At this distance, our observations have\na spatial resolution of 14\u2032\u2032 = 0.8 kpc. Altogether, our final cube has a rms noise of \u03c3 = 0.404\nmJy km s\u22121 beam\u22121 channel\u22121 . At 5\u03c3 we achieve a mass sensitivity of 4.7 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 channel\u22121\nand a column density of 9.6 \u00d7 1019 cm\u22122 beam\u22121 channel\u22121 .\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\nWe present our data cube in the form of channel maps in Figures 1-3. These channel maps\nhave been clipped at the 3\u03c3 level to emphasize the galactic emission. The figures illustrate the\ngeneral rotation of NGC 2997, but also show evidence of a thick disk and additional H I that is\n1\n\nIn Miriad, the imported image headers were incomplete:\nwe had to set the rest frequency to\n1.420405752 GHz and, for the purposes of estimating the rms noise before imaging, we added the correct values for the system temperature (76 K) and system gain (0.22 Jy/K/antenna \u00d7 30 antennas).\nhttp://www.gmrt.ncra.tifr.res.in/gmrt_hpage/Users/doc/spec_mod.pdf\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nmoving at velocities inconsistent with a rotating thin disk.\nIn Figure 4 we present moment maps created from the data cubes: the optical DSS image with\nH I contours, the total H I intensity map, the velocity field, and the velocity dispersion (moments\n0-2). The moments are calculated independently for each pixel within a specified clip range-in\nour case, it is calculated from pixels containing emission above 5\u03c3 of our rms sensitivity in order\nto avoid large outliers, particularly on the outskirts of the galaxy where the noise is increasing\nwith distance from the pointing center. In the optical image, it becomes evident that the H I gas is\nextended to the northwest with respect to the optical disk. However, the intensity weighted velocity\nmap looks fairly well behaved; there is no direct evidence that the galaxy has been disturbed by a\nstrong encounter. Finally, the velocity dispersion map shows that the greatest dispersion occurs in\nthe center likely due to beam smearing effects and due to intense star formation as suggested by\nstrong radio continuum emission at the center of the galaxy.\nFigure 5 shows the integrated H I profile over the area of the entire galaxy. Summing the\nemission in this profile yields a total flux for NGC 2997 of 226.6 Jy km s\u22121 . This compares to\n162.3 Jy km s\u22121 from HIPASS (Meyer et al. 2004). However, the latter value is likely to be low\nsince the HIPASS measurement assumed the galaxy was unresolved. At a distance of 12.2 Mpc,\nour measured flux corresponds to a total H I mass of 7.96 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 .\nWe are interested in understanding the nature of the H I in NGC 2997 and identifying gas\nclouds that are analogous to the HVCs observed in the Milky Way. In decomposing the galaxy,\nwe find there are three components that contribute to its total H I content. A thin disk dominates\nthe total H I emission and can be modeled by a Gaussian profile with a velocity dispersion of\n11 \u00b1 3 km s\u22121 . We modeled and fit a rotation curve to this thin disk, however, there is additional\ngas that appears as a wing on the side of the thin disk's velocity profile towards the systemic\nvelocity. This \"thick disk\" contributes approximately 16 \u2212 17% of the total H I mass and has a\nvelocity dispersion of \u223c 16 km s\u22121 . While this second component shows regular rotation, it lags\nbehind the thin disk at a relatively constant rate. The third component consists of H I emission\nthat cannot be explained in terms of either disk component, and some of which is counter-rotating.\nThese three components stand out in Figure 6.\nTable 2 summarizes the properties we derive for the galaxy. We calculate a new distance to\nNGC 2997 based on the 2MASS Tully-Fisher relations from Masters et al. (2008). The radio center,\nsystemic velocity, inclination, position angle, and the maximum rotational velocity come from our\nrotation curve fit to the velocity field. The integrated flux and MHI come directly from the data\ncube. Mdyn is calculated from the maximum rotational velocity. The velocity gradient, scale height\nand cyclindrical height come from our best fit model of the extraplanar H I. The star formation\nrate is estimated from values in the literature. Sections 3.1-3.3 and Discussion describe in detail\nhow we arrive at these values.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nTable 2: Properties of NGC 2997\nProperty\nHubble Type\nOptical Center (J2000)\nOptical Extent\nDistance\nRadio Center (J2000)\nRadio Extent\nSystemic Velocity\nInclination, i\nPostion Angle\nIntegrated Flux Density\nH I Mass, MHI\nMaximum vrot\nDynamical Mass, Mdyn\nVelocity gradient, dv\ndz\nScale Height, z\nCyclindrical Height, zcyl\nStar Formation Rate\n\nValue\nSAca\n09h 45m 38.8s -31\u25e6 11\u2032 27.9\u2032\u2032a\n8.9\u2032 \u00d7 6.8\u2032a\n12.2 Mpcb\n09h 45m 35.9s -31\u25e6 11\u2032 27.8\u2032\u2032\n15.6\u2032 \u00d7 11.1\u2032c\n1089 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121\n32.3\u25e6 \u00b1 0.3\n107.1\u25e6 \u00b1 0.6\n226.6 Jy km s\u22121\n7.96 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 b\n226 \u00b1 2 km s\u22121\n2.1 \u00d7 1011 M\u2299\n18 \u2212 31 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121\n0.7 \u00b1 0.2 kpc\n0.5 \u00b1 0.1 kpc\n5 \u00b1 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121\n\nNote. - Unless otherwise stated, the values in Table 2 are derived from this work.\na\n\nOptical position and extent obtained from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED).\n\nb\n\nDistance and H I mass are derived from the 2MASS Tully Fisher relations of Masters et al.

To model it, we clipped the\ndata cube at 10% of the galaxy's peak emission (in a manner similar to Fraternali et al. 2002)\nand fit a Gaussian to this upper part of the velocity profiles. By clipping the emission at this\nlevel we prevent the subsequent analysis of NGC 2997's thin disk from being biased by broad, low\ncolumn density H I velocity components. We fit a rotation curve to the thin disk following the\nprocedure of Begeman (1989). We assume that the position angle and inclination of the galaxy are\nconstant for all radii (we assume an ideal, flat disk), and from this we derive a systemic velocity\nof 1089 \u00b1 5 km s\u22121 , a position angle of 107.1\u25e6 \u00b1 0.6 and an inclination of 32.3\u25e6 \u00b1 0.3. The errors\nare the average errors found for rings between 5 \u2212 30 kpc, however, Figure 7 shows that there is a\ngradient in the position angle, which has not been taken into account.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe top panel of Figure 7 shows our best fit rotation curve. It rises out to \u223c 12 kpc, then\nslowly declines to greater than 25 kpc. We trust this rotation curve to \u223c 28 kpc, beyond which the\nlopsidedness of the H I emission produces large errors in the fit. In addition, in order to understand\nthe quality of our assumption that the disk is flat and ideal, we re-fit the rotation curve allowing the\ninclination and the position angle to vary while keeping the rotational velocity fixed to the value\nfound for each ring in the tilted ring model. The middle and bottom panels of Figure 7 show how\nthe inclination and position angle, respectively, vary with radius. In these instances the rotational\nvelocity for each ring is fixed to the value plotted in the top panel.\nThere is evidence that NGC 2997 deviates from the ideal, flat disk. The bottom panel of Figure\n7 suggests that we were unable to fit a self-consistent rotation curve with a uniform position angle\nbecause it declines steadily with radius. In the tilted-ring model, inclination and rotation velocity\nare coupled through a vrot sin i term. This makes for a degeneracy between a flat inclination and\nfalling rotation curve that is particularly strong for low inclination galaxies. The \"S\" like appearance\nof contours near the minor axis (Figure 4) indicate that NGC 2997 may have a slightly warped H I\ndisk.\n\n3.2.\n\nModeling the Lagging Thick Disk\n\nOur deep observations of NGC 2997 show that the H I gas is not confined to the thin disk.\nIn p-v slices the contours of H I emission show a shallow gradient towards the systemic velocity: a\nfeature which has been identified in a small number of other galaxies and has been referred to as a\n\"beard\" (e.g. NGC 2403; Schaap et al. 2000; Fraternali et al. 2002). After modeling the dominant\nH I component, we subtract the thin disk from the original data cube and find that 1.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299\nof residual H I emission remains-about 18% of the total MHI of the galaxy.\nThis second component can be fit by a Gaussian with a higher velocity dispersion than the\nthin disk (\u223c 16 km s\u22121 ) which reflects the thermal motions of the gas convolved with a vertical\nvelocity gradient (de Blok & Walter 2006). The peak velocity of the fitted Gaussian resides closer\nto the systemic velocity of the galaxy than gas in the thin disk at the same radius. In other words,\nit appears to follow galactic rotation, but at slower rotational velocities. We fit a second rotation\ncurve to the residual data by assuming that this thick disk has the same large-scale morphology as\nthe thin disk, with the same systemic velocity (1089 km s\u22121 ), position angle (107\u25e6 ) and inclination\n(32\u25e6 ). From Figure 8 we see that peaks in the two rotation curves roughly coincide with one\nanother, implying that they are related, however the thick disk consistently lags behind that of the\nthin disk by \u223c 60 km s\u22121 . A similar lagging disk has been observed in NGC 891 (25 \u2212 200 km s\u22121 ;\nSwaters et al. 1997) and NGC 2403 (25 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 ; Schaap et al. 2000; Fraternali et al. 2002).\nTo understand this relation we also attempted to derive the thick disk rotation curve from\nthe residual data without assuming it has the same properties as the thin disk. While we successfully fit a position angle (\u223c 25\u25e6 ), we were unable to find a consistent inclination. In NGC 2403,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nFraternali et al. (2002) show that a rotated position angle, such as this can be explained by an\noverall inflow of the anomalous gas. However, as we find no other evidence for radial gas motion\nwhen we include it in our models of NGC 2997, we disregard it.\nWe took this kinematic modeling a step further by adding a velocity gradient to the rotation\ncurve as a function of height above the disk mid-plane. We followed similar procedures to those\ndemonstrated by Heald et al. (2006a) and Oosterloo et al. (2007). The GIPSY task GALMOD\nallows one to create a model data cube from user supplied parameters: the rotational velocity,\nthe scale height and the surface density. A modified version of this task (Heald, 2008, private\ncommunication) includes two additional parameters to specify (1) the rate of change in velocity,\ndv/dz, with height, z, and (2) a cylindrical height above the disk at which the gradient begins, zcyl ,\nsuch that the rotation of the gas is described by the following equations:\n)\n(\nvrot (R, 0)\nz \u2264 zcyl ,\n.\n(1)\nvrot (R, z) =\nvrot (R, 0) \u2212 (z \u2212 zcyl ) dv\ndz z \u2265 zcyl\nWe examined p-v slices along the galaxy's major axis to compare the models created from the\nmodified GALMOD task with our data (Figure 9).\nThe cylindrical height was the easiest parameter to fit. It is defined as the distance from the\nmid-plane at which the velocity gradient begins. Setting its value has the effect of imposing the\nvelocity at which the peak of the emission occurs. For example, with a smaller cylindrical height\nthe velocity gradient begins closer to the mid-plane and, for an inclined galaxy, the resulting sum\nof emission projected along the line of sight appears to shift towards lower velocities. A cylindrical\nheight of 0.5\u00b10.1 kpc fits our data best. This is within the range of values derived for other galaxies:\nHeald et al. (2007) report values ranging from 0.4 kpc in NGC 4302 to 1.2 kpc in NGC 5775 using\nH\u03b1 kinematics of ionized gas; while Oosterloo et al. (2007) report a value of 1.3 kpc for NGC 891\nin H I.\nThe value of the scale height predominately influences the lowest level H I contours of the p-v\ndiagram. A large scale height places more emitting material at greater distances from the disk\nand, therefore, at lower velocities with respect to the rotational velocity at the mid-plane so the\nH I contours become shallower toward the systemic velocity with increasing scale height. The best\nfit for the scale height is 0.7 \u00b1 0.2 kpc. Our errors are based on the resolution of parameter space\nsampled and the degree to which the models differed significantly by eye.\nThe model is least sensitive to the velocity gradient, probably due to NGC 2997's relatively low\ninclination and the low column density of the gas in the lagging disk. Varying this value changes\nthe gradient of the H I contours in the model, however it does so less dramatically than varying\nthe scale height. This, combined with the clumpiness of the H I due to spiral arms and other\nfeatures in the disk, make it difficult to estimate a good fit. We estimate the velocity gradient to\nbe between 18 \u2212 31 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 . Again, these values fall in the range reported for NGC 4302\n(22.8 \u2212 59.2 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ; Heald et al. 2007), NGC 5775 (8 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ; Heald et al. 2006a), and\nNGC 891 (15 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ; Oosterloo et al. 2007).\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nAnomalous H I\n\nIn spite of this extensive modeling, there is a significant amount of remaining H I that is\nspatially or kinematically distinct from the disk gas. In order to identify this faint emission we\nHanning smoothed in velocity and spatially smoothed the data to twice the original beam size. The\nresulting cube has a resolution of 28\u2032\u2032 \u00d722\u2032\u2032 . The rms noise improves to \u03c3 = 0.15 mJy beam\u22121 , or\na 5\u03c3 mass sensitivity of 1.7 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 channel\u22121 and column density of 8.9 \u00d7 1018 cm\u22122 beam\u22121\nchannel\u22121 . We visually searched this cube and found several examples of anomalous H I features\nwhose basic properties are presented in Table 3: their projected radial distance from the center of\nthe galaxy, their velocity offset from the H I disk, and their H I mass as well as an estimate for\ntheir contribution to the mass accretion rate. This is not an exhaustive list, but merely illustrates\nsome of the most prominant examples of HVC analogs associated with NGC 2997. Figure 10 shows\nwhere we have taken slices through the smoothed data cube to present these features in Figures\n11A\u2013D.\nOf these anomalous features, we find 5 examples of H I clouds that are completely distinct from\nthe H I disk. They were identified in p-v slices as having velocity offsets of greater than 50 km s\u22121\nfrom H I gas in the disk at the same position (Figures 10 & 11). In three of the five examples, the\nH I gas is counter-rotating with respect to the H I disk (Slices A & C), and in one instance we find\nan H I cloud whose velocity component along the line of sight is actually faster than the rotation\nof the disk (Slice B). The clouds we identify reside within 20 kpc from the center of the galaxy,\nwhich places them within the extent of the projected H I disk, but outside the optical disk as it is\nseen in DSS images (Figure 4), and they all have H I masses of approximately 107 M\u2299 . They were\nnot detected by Pisano et al. (2007) because of the low angular resolution of their Parkes (14\u2032 ) and\nATCA (\u223c 1\u2032 ) data. There are significant indications of a larger population of H I clouds around\nNGC 2997, however we are less confident in their identification because they are closer to our mass\nsensitivity limit and because of residual phase calibration errors in the data cube.\nIn addition to the H I clouds, there are two other prominent features of anomalous H I we see\nin velocity channels: a \"spur\" of counter-rotating gas near the center of the galaxy and a \"tail\"\nof emission lagging in rotation, extending to the west from the north half of the galaxy. Unlike\nthe H I clouds which are distinct, both of these features are connected to the main disk of the\ngalaxy (making it difficult to estimate their mass). The \"spur\" is attached north of the center,\nand arcs to the east and south extending greater than 6 kpc east from the center of the galaxy\n(v = 1016.1 \u2212 1082.0 km s\u22121 in Figures 1 & 2). In p-v slices the same feature looks like a shell\nof emission that is connected to the disk (Figure 11B, C & D). We estimate the H I mass in the\nspur to be \u223c 2.6 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 . The \"tail\" contributes to the asymmetry total intensity map (Figure\n4). Although the contours of the intensity weighted velocity map (Figure 4) are well behaved,\nindividual velocity channels, v = 943.5 \u2212 983.1 km s\u22121 (Figure 1), show emission on the north side\nof the galaxy. The coherence of this emission can be seen in Slices A & B of Figure 11: the feature\nlooks like a bifurcation of the H I disk in p-v space. Its velocity component along the line of sight\nis actually moving faster than the rotation of the disk. We calculate the mass of the tail to be\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n3.1 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 .\nTable 3: Properties of Anomalous H I Clouds in NGC 2997\nDistance Velocitya\nTF Massb\nAccretion Ratec\nObj.

The thick disk has a mass of 1.4 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 , a broader velocity dispersion, \u223c 16 km s\u22121 , and\nlags behind the rotational velocity of the thin disk by \u223c 60 km s\u22121 . The anomalous H I clouds are\nspatially or kinematically distinct from both H I disk components. The clouds have individual H I\nmasses between 106.7\u22127.3 M\u2299 , are offset from the disk by 80 \u2212 200 km s\u22121 and, in some instances,\nare counter-rotating. In this section we compare our results with the distribution of H I observed\naround other galaxies, we speculate on the possible origins of NGC 2297's HVC analogs, we discuss\nour results in the context of the Local Group HVCs, and we examine the effect of our distance\nestimate on our conclusions.\n\n4.1.\n\nExtraplanar H I\n\nNGC 2997 is one of the lowest inclination galaxies in which a lagging disk has been modeled.\nIt is impossible to do this same decomposition for a face-on galaxy because the measured velocities\ncontain no information on the rotation of the gas, but moderate to high inclination galaxies are\nwell suited to this analysis. The velocity gradient we estimate for NGC 2997, 18 \u2212 31 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 ,\nappears to be typical of spiral galaxies for which deep observations reveal extended extraplanar gas.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nOur findings are consistent with that seen in NGC 2403 where Fraternali et al. (2001) calculate\nthe thick disk to have a mean rotation velocity 25 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 lower than that of the thin disk,\nin NGC 4459 where Barbieri et al. (2005) find a thick disk that lags by 12 \u2212 25 km s\u22121 , and\nin NGC 891, where the velocity gradient ranges from 14 to 43 km s\u22121 kpc\u22121 depending on the\nlocation in the galaxy (Oosterloo et al. 2007). NGC 6946 also has a similar lagging halo of cold gas\n(Boomsma et al. 2008).\nThis range of values for the velocity gradient in spiral galaxies suggests that one might correlate\nit with star formation activity. Heald et al. (2006a,b, 2007) have done a complementary study of\nthree high inclination galaxies, NGC 5775, NGC 891, and NGC 4302, in which they find that the\nmagnitude of the velocity gradient, measured in ionized gas (H\u03b1), decreases with star formation\nactivity, as measured in far infrared luminosity. For NGC 2997, we calculate a star formation rate\nof 5 \u00b1 1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 from 60 and 100 \u03bcm IRAS fluxes (following Kewley et al. 2002; Bell 2003) and 1.4\nGHz fluxes (following Condon et al. 2002; Bell 2003). However, it is unclear how well NGC 2997\nsupports such a correlation: its values for the velocity gradient and scale height are close to the\nmean of those galaxies, while the star formation rate is a bit high. Heald et al. (2007) also suggest\nthat the product of the velocity gradient and the scale height tends towards 20 km s\u22121 . We estimate\ndv/dhz = 12 \u2212 21 km s\u22121 , which is consistent with their suggestion.\nFrom a theoretical standpoint, the detection of a thick, lagging disk is consistent with the\nidea developed by Bregman (1980) in which the Galactic HVCs are clouds condensing out of a hot\nGalactic corona fed by supernovae in the disk. In his galactic fountain model, gas blown out of the\ndisk by star formation moves radially outward and slows down to conserve angular momentum as it\nmoves vertically away from the mid-plane. If the observed lag is only due to conservation of angular\nmomentum then, in the case of NGC 2997, gas that lags by 60 km s\u22121 behind a disk rotating at\n200 km s\u22121 originated 70% closer to the center of the galaxy. However, if hydrodynamic effects\nare important, the radial motion is less dramatic. Cooling gas condenses out of the corona and\nmoves inward again. Evidence for radial inflow of 10 \u2212 20 km s\u22121 has been observed in NGC 2403\n(Fraternali et al. 2001) and perhaps in NGC 4559 (Barbieri et al. 2005). We do not find evidence\nfor radial inflow of H I in NGC 2997, but such a signature may be ambiguous due to the low\ninclination of the galaxy. Radially infalling clouds would also be expected if these clouds originated\nin a cooling hot galactic halo that is at the virial temperature of the dark matter halo as proposed\nby Maller & Bullock (2004), however holes in the H I disk may be evidence that supernovae are\nresponsible for circulating this gas.\nIn a number of cases where we see anomalous H I clouds in p-v slices, we also see depressions\nin the H I column density in the disk (Slices B & D). These H I \"holes\" occur near the outskirts\nof the H I disk, but outside of the optical disk, and we hesitate at calling them holes because they\nfrequently occur between two H I spiral arms. These may be sites where H I has been blown out of\nthe disk from supernovae, however one cannot rule out that these may also be the result of a dwarf\ngalaxy that has impacted the disk. For example, this may be the case for large holes in NGC 6946\n(Boomsma et al. 2008) and M 101 (van der Hulst & Sancisi 1988). In any case, it is interesting to\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nnote that all of the anomalous H I we identify is coincident with the H I disk and we do not find\nany large H I clouds far from it.\nThe large clouds of counter-rotating H I gas and the \"spur\" cannot be explained by a galactic\nfountain mechanism. While fountain gas lags behind the main disk in rotation, it will conserve\nangular momentum and so can not be counter-rotating. Additionally, to eject clouds of 107 M\u2299\nfrom the disk at the observed velocity offsets requires an spatially and temporally coherent injection\nof 1054 ergs of energy. This corresponds to of order 104 supernovae, assuming 10% efficiency. Despite\nthe star formation rate of NGC 2997, this appears to be implausibly high. Based on this energy\nargument, and their position with respect to the optical disk, we conclude that these H I features\nare more likely material being accreted by NGC 2997, either out of a hot galactic halo (Peek et al.\n2008), or are the remnants of a tidally disrupted gas rich dwarf galaxy. The maximum individual\ncloud mass from the Peek et al. (2008) simulations is 5 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , however they do not rule out\nthe possibility of cloud complexes having higher masses. We estimate a lower limit for the total\naccretion rate of 1.2 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which may help sustain the vigorous star formation rate, especially\nif it is augmented by gas from the lagging disk which one would expect to eventually fall back\ntowards the mid-plane.\nFeatures such as the asymmetry in the extended northwest spiral arm are usually interpreted\nas evidence for past interactions between galaxies, and there are two possible culprits. The nearest\nLGG 180 group galaxy is a dwarf galaxy, ESO 434-G041, which is \u223c 115 kpc to the southeast.\nIt is resolved in our ATCA observations, but lies outside the primary beam of the GMRT. NED\nlists another dwarf galaxy, ESO 434-G030, \u223c 90 kpc to the southwest, but we do not see this\ngalaxy in our data. Assuming that the velocity differences in the plane of the sky are similar to\nthe line-of-sight velocity differences between these galaxies and NGC 2997, any encounter would\nhave taken place \u223c 1 Gyr ago. While there are no apparent connections between these galaxies\nand NGC 2997 in H I, nor any optical signatures of disturbances in the dwarf galaxies, a past tidal\nevent or interaction seems to be the most likely explanation for pulling such a large amount of H I\nfrom the disk in such a coherent manner, causing the asymmetry. On the other hand, we do not\nbelieve that interactions are the most probable origin for the anamolous H I clouds. Similarly, the\n\"tail\" feature, on the northwest side of the galaxy, seems best explained by accretion\u2013perhaps a\ndwarf galaxy that has been tidally disrupted as it passed near NGC 2997.\n\n4.2.\n\nComparison with M 31 Clouds and Galactic HVCs\n\nWe have identified the most massive anomalous H I clouds associated with NGC 2297. These\nfive clouds have masses of order 107 M\u2299 . The spectrum of cloud masses extends to lower masses\nbut, in many cases, it is difficult to separate them as distinct from emission in the thick disk.\nNonetheless, we can still compare the clouds we have identified with those reported in the Local\nGroup and around other galaxies.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nThe H I mass distribution of clouds in M 31 given by dM(MHI ) \u221d MHI \u22122 dMHI , allows us to\nestimate the total number of similar clouds we should expect to see around NGC 2997. Most clouds\nhave masses in the range (0.15\u22121.3)\u00d7106 M\u2299 with only Davies' Cloud having MHI = 107 M\u2299 . For\nsources smaller than our beamsize, seen by Thilker et al. (2004) we would expect to detect about\n10 of the M 31 HVC analogs at the 5\u03c3 level (and about 4 above the 10\u03c3 level); for those clouds\nthat we could resolve, we lack the column density sensitivity to detect them. However, we already\nknow from the observations of Pisano et al. (2007) that there are no low column density H I clouds\nresiding off the disk of NGC 2997. The HVCs discovered around M 31 in higher resolution images\nby Westmeier et al. (2005) have an average size of 1 kpc (equivalent to the size of our beam at the\ndistance of NGC 2997) and are below our detection limits.\nWith recently determined distant brackets to Milky Way HVCs, we can put our H I clouds into\na local context. For Complex C, Wakker et al. (2007) estimate MHI to be (0.7 \u2212 6) \u00d7 106 M\u2299 . The\nH I masses for four other clouds range from (0.09 \u2212 0.41) \u00d7 104 M\u2299 (Cloud g1) to (0.68 \u2212 1.60) \u00d7 106\nM\u2299 (Complex GCP; Wakker et al. 2008). Therefore, at the distance of NGC 2997, we are only\nsensitive to the most massive Milky Way HVCs for which distance measurements exist. However,\nwe also see more massive features (\u223c 107 M\u2299 ) for which their are few counterparts around the Milky\nWay and M 31. Nonetheless, our discoveries are consistent with anomalous H I clouds observed in\nother galaxies (Sancisi et al. 2008, and references therein).\n\n4.3.\n\nImplications of the Distance Estimate to NGC 2997\n\nThe distribution of H I clouds we find around NGC 2997 can be used to place limits on\ncosmological and large scale structure simulations for the number of small dark matter halos around\nmassive galaxies. The H I masses we calculate depend on the square of the assumed distance to the\ngalaxy. However, local large scale structure results in an inaccurate distance estimate to NGC 2997\nbecause its peculiar velocity is not dominated by Hubble flow. Unfortunately, an attempt to correct\nfor this, the velocity flow model of Masters (2005), is sparsely populated by galaxies in the volume\naround NGC 2997, so we choose to calculate the distance to NGC 2997 using the Tully-Fisher\nrelation (hereafter TF).\nThe TF relations based on near infrared observations may be the most reliable because they are\nless impacted by dust than optical magnitudes. We retrieved the 2MASS J, H, and K-band magnitudes from NED and used the bias corrected TF parameters specific to Sc galaxies (Masters et al.\n2008, Table 2):\nM (J) \u2212 5 log h = \u221221.017 \u2212 9.228(log W \u2212 2.5)\nM (H) \u2212 5 log h = \u221221.847 \u2212 9.165(log W \u2212 2.5)\nM (K) \u2212 5 log h = \u221222.039 \u2212 10.092(log W \u2212 2.5)\nTo estimate the internal extinction, we interpolated between I and K bands to get values for J and\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nH using the formulae in Courteau et al. (2007). The FWHM of the H I profile (W = 445 km s\u22121 )\ncomes from Parkes observations (Pisano et al. 2007, Pisano et al. 2009, in preparation), corrected\nfor instrumental effects, turbulent motions, cosmological broadening, and inclination as per the\nformula in Masters et al. (2008). From these 2MASS TF relations we derive a mean distance of\n12.2 \u00b1 0.9 Mpc.\nThis new distance estimate places NGC 2997 about 10% closer to the Milky Way than the\nestimates found on NED, corrected for peculiar velocity due to local density enhancements, and\n18% closer than the velocity flow model of Masters (2005). This places somewhat tighter constraints\non the fact that we do not see a large population of H I clouds outside the disk of NGC 2997. The\nanomalous H I clouds within the disk, for which we calculate masses, become more consistent with\nthose observed around M 31 and more consistent with the mass estimate for Complex C in the\nMilky Way. Despite this closer distance estimate, the difference between it and previous estimates\nis not enough to change the formation hypotheses for the individual clouds we identify.\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nOur observations of NGC 2297 reveal a galaxy with a lagging, thick disk and anamolous H I\nclouds in the halo similar to other galaxies, such as NGC 2403 (Fraternali et al. 2001) and NGC 6946\n(Boomsma et al. 2008). The presence of a lagging disk, which may be caused by star formation\nactivity, and the presence of large H I clouds and counter-rotating gas from accretion show that\nmany processes contribute to the distribution of this cold gas.\nWe propose that the lagging disk is the result of a galactic fountain process in which gas is\nblown out of the disk by supernovae. This gas experiences a decreasing gravitational force as it\nmoves away from the mid-plane, so it drifts radially outward. As a result, this gas rotates in the\nsame sense as the thin disk, but at slower velocities to conserve angular momentum. From IRAS\n60 and 100 \u03bcm, and 1.4 GHz radio continuum fluxes we estimate fairly vigorous star formation\nrate in NGC 2997 of about 5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 to support the renewal of this lagging disk. Of the total H I\nmass of the galaxy, 16 \u2212 17% resides in this lagging disk.\nThe most likely origin for the H I clouds we discover is accretion from a hot galactic halo or from\nnearby dark matter halos. The H I cloud masses are of order 107 M\u2299 . From their velocity offset\nwith respect to nearby disk gas, we estimate a kinetic energy for the clouds relative to the rotation\nof the disk of \u223c 1054 ergs and conclude that it is unlikely their presence is due to supernovae.\nMeanwhile, the spur and tail may be the remnants of tidally disrupted gas rich dwarf galaxies.\nThe anomalous H I we identify makes up approximately 1 \u2212 2% of the total H I mass. Finally,\nthe asymmetry of NGC 2997 to the northwest appears best explained by a tidal interaction with\nanother galaxy, although it is not obvious whom the culprit may be.\nThe features we find are not out of line with those observed in the Local Group, nor compared\nto other galaxies for which similar observations and modeling have been done, although the clouds of\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nNGC 2997 tend to be more massive than the clouds for which we have distance brackets in the Milky\nWay, even with an improved distance from the 2MASS Tully-Fisher relations that place NGC 2997\n12 \u2212 23% closer. In spite of NGC 2997's relative isolation, we believe that a number of dynamic\nprocesses contribute to the sum of extraplanar H I gas, including star formation, accretion, and\ngalaxy interactions. Deeper observations of NGC 2997 as have been accomplished with NGC 891\nwould likely continue to reveal extended structure.\n\n6.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge George Heald for sharing his modified GIPSY task to model the\nlagging disk.
