Let U be a numeration system, a set X \u2286 N is U -star-free\nif the set made up of the U -representations of the elements in X is a\nstar-free regular language. Answering a question of A. de Luca and\nA. Restivo [10], we obtain a complete logical characterization of the\nU -star-free sets of integers for suitable numeration systems related to a\nPisot number and in particular for integer base systems. For these latter\nsystems, we study as well the problem of the base dependence. Finally,\nthe case of k-adic systems is also investigated.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn the study of numeration systems, a natural question is to determine\nif a set of non-negative integers has a \"simple\" representation within the\nconsidered number system. Otherwise stated, is it possible for a given set\nX \u2282 N, to find a \"simple\" algorithm (a finite automaton) testing membership in X ? This question has given rise to a lot of papers dealing with the\nso-called recognizable sets. A subset X of N is said to be k-recognizable if\nthe language made up of the k-ary expansions of all the elements in X is\nregular (i.e., recognizable by a finite automaton).\nSince the work of A. Cobham [3], it is well-known that the recognizability\nof a set depends on the base of the numeration system. If k and l are two\nmultiplicatively independent integers then the only subsets of N which are\nsimultaneously k-recognizable and l-recognizable are exactly the ultimately\nperiodic sets.\nAmong the recognizable sets, it could be interesting to describe the sets\nwhose corresponding languages of representations belong to a specific subset of regular languages. Among the regular languages, the \"simplest\" are\ncertainly the star-free languages because the automata accepting those languages are counter-free. Having in mind this idea of \"simpler\" representation\nof a set, A. de Luca and A. Restivo have considered in [10] the problem of\ndetermining the existence of a suitable base k such that the k-ary representations of the elements belonging to a set X \u2282 N made up a regular language\nof (unrestricted) star-height 0 (such a set is then said to be k-star-free). One\nof the main results of [10] is that if a l-recognizable set X is such that its\ndensity function is bounded by c(log n)d , for some constants c and d, then\nthere exists a base k such that X is k-star-free.\nThe star-free languages have been extensively studied in the literature\n[12, 14, 15, 16]. In particular M.P. Sch\u00fctzenberger has shown that the starfree languages - i.e., the languages expressed in terms of extended regular\nDate: November 14, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nM. RIGO\n\nexpressions without the star operation - are exactly the aperiodic languages\n[14]. We recall that a language L \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 is aperiodic if there exists a positive\ninteger n such that for all words u, v, w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 ,\nuv n w \u2208 L \u21d4 uv n+1 w \u2208 L.\nIn the present paper, we answer some of the remaining open questions\nadressed in [10] about sets of integers having a representation of star height\n0. Especially, we give a complete characterization of the k-recognizable sets\nsuch that the language of k-ary expansions is aperiodic. To obtain this result,\nwe use the first-order logical characterization of the star-free languages given\nby R. McNaughton and S. Papert [12].\nIn the first two sections, for the sake of simplicity we consider the case of\nthe binary system. Next, we show how our results can be extended not only\nto the k-ary systems but also to numeration systems defined by a linear recurrent sequence whose characteristic polynomial is the minimal polynomial\nof a Pisot number (a Pisot number is an algebraic integer \u03b8 > 1 such that\nthe other roots of the minimal polynomial of \u03b8 have modulus less than one).\nIn this wider framework, we have to consider the additional assumption that\nthe set of all the representations computed by the greedy algorithm is starfree. For instance, this assumption is satisfied for the Fibonacci system. In\nSection 5, we consider the problem of the base dependence of the aperiodicity of the representations for integer base systems. The obtained result can\nbe related to the celebrated Cobham's theorem: only ultimately periodic\nsets can be k- and l-star-free for two multilplicatively integers k and l but if\nthe period p of an ultimately periodic set is greater than 1 then this set is\nk-star-free for some k depending on p but not for all k \u2208 N. In particular,\nwe show that a set is k-star-free if and only if it is k n -star-free for any n \u2265 1.\nIn the last section, we consider the case of the unambiguous k-adic numeration system. It is worth noticing that the unique k-adic representation of\nan integer is not computed through the greedy algorithm and therefore this\nsystem differs from the other systems encountered in this paper. It appears\nunsurprisingly that the star-free sets with respect to this latter system are\nexactly the k-star-free sets.\nIn the following, we assume the reader familiar with basic formal languages theory (see for instance, [5]). Finite automata will be denoted as\n5-tuples M = (Q, q0 , F, \u03a3, \u03b4) where Q is the set of states, q0 is the initial states, F \u2286 Q is the set of final states, \u03a3 is the input alphabet and\n\u03b4 : Q \u00d7 \u03a3 \u2192 Q is the transition function.\n2. Logical characterization of star-free languages\nLet us consider the alphabet \u03a32 = {0, 1}. A word w in \u03a3+\n2 can be identified as a finite model Mw = (M, <, P1 ) where M = {1, . . . , |w|} (|w| is\nthe length of w), < is the usual binary relation on M and P1 is a unary\npredicate for the set of positions in w carrying the letter 1. For our convenience, positions are counted from right to left. As an example, the word\nw = 1101001 corresponds to the model (M, <, P1 ) where M = {1, . . . , 7}\nand P1 = {1, 4, 6, 7}. For further purposes, as in [16] we expand this model\nwith its maximal element max (in the latter example, max = 7) - notice\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n3\n\nthat max is definable in terms of <. So to each nonempty word in \u03a3+\n2 is\nassociated a model (M, <, P1 , max).\nA language is said to be star-free if it is obtained from finite sets by a finite\nnumber of Boolean operations (union, intersection and complementation)\nand concatenation products. McNaughton and Papert have shown that\nthese languages are exactly those defined by first-order sentences when words\nare considered as finite ordered models [12] (a sentence is a formula whose all\nvariables are bound). As an example, the language 1+ 0\u2217 is star-free because\nif we denote by X the complement \u03a3\u22172 \\ X of X then\n1+ 0\u2217 = {1}\u2205{0}\u2205 \u2205{1}\u2205 where \u2205 = {0} \u2229 {00}\nand this language is also defined by the formula\n(1)\n\n(\u2203x)[P1 (x) \u2227 (\u2200y)(x < y \u2192 P1 (y)) \u2227 (\u2200y)(y < x \u2192 \u00acP1 (y))].\n\nThe language of all the formulas defining star-free languages will be denoted\nby LSF (if necessary, to recall the alphabet \u03a32 we can write LSF,2 ). Notice\nthat with these finite models, we are not considering the empty word.\nTo be precise, if \u03c6(x0 , . . . , xn ) is a formula having at most x0 , . . . , xn as\nfree variables, the interpretation of \u03c6 in a word-model Mw having M as\ndomain and r0 , . . . , rn as M -elements is defined in a natural manner and we\nwrite Mw |= \u03c6[r0 , . . . , rn ] if \u03c6 is satisfied in Mw when interpreting xi by ri .\nThe language defined by a formula \u03c6 is\n{w \u2208 \u03a3+\n2 | Mw |= \u03c6}.\n2.1. Syntax of logical formulas in LSF . The first-order language of the\nfinite ordered models representing words is defined as follows. The variables\nare denoted x, y, z, . . . and are ranging over M -elements. The terms are\nobtained from the variables and the constant max. The atomic formulas\nare obtained by the following rules:\n1. if \u03c41 and \u03c42 are terms then \u03c41 < \u03c42 and \u03c41 = \u03c42 are atomic formulas\n2. if \u03c4 is a term then P1 (\u03c4 ) is an atomic formula.\nFinally, we obtain the set LSF of all the formulas by using the Boolean connectives \u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u2192, \u2194 and the first-order quantifiers (\u2203x) . . . and (\u2200x) . . .\nwhere x is a variable.\nNotice that for convenience we are somehow redundant in our definitions,\n\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 stands for \u00ac(\u00ac\u03c6 \u2227 \u00ac\u03c8), x = y stands for \u00ac((x < y) \u2228 (y < x)), \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8\nstands for \u00ac\u03c6 \u2228 \u03c8 and \u03c6 \u2194 \u03c8 stands for (\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c8) \u2227 (\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6). We also write\nx \u2264 y for (x < y) \u2228 (x = y).\nIt is worth noting that in this formalism we can define y = x + 1, where\nx and y are variables,\ny = x + 1 \u2261 (x < y) \u2227 (\u2200z)(x < z \u2192 y \u2264 z)\nbut the form z = x + y is not allowed, if x, y and z are variables [12].\n3. Logical characterization of recognizable sets of integers\nIn the present section, we consider the binary numeration system. If x is\nan non-negative integer, the binary expansion of x computed through the\ngreedy algorithm (the normalized 2-representation of x) is denoted \u03c12 (x)\n(for a presentation of the greedy algorithm, see [6]). Notice that \u03c12 (0) is the\n\n\f4\n\nM. RIGO\n\nempty word \u03b5 and we allow leading zeroes in normalized 2-representations.\nThus, the set of all the normalized representations is\nN2 = 0\u2217 {\u03c12 (n) | n \u2208 N}.\nA set X of integers is said to be 2-recognizable if the set \u03c12 (X) of the\nnormalized 2-representations of all the elements in X is a regular language.\nRemark 1. Allowing leading zeroes does not change the star-free behavior\nof a language made up of representations. Indeed, let \u03a3k = {0, . . . , k \u2212 1},\nk \u2265 2 and L \u2282 \u03a3\u2217k \\ 0\u03a3\u2217k be a regular language consisting of words which do\nnot begin with 0. Then L is star-free if and only if 0\u2217 L is star-free. Indeed,\n0\u2217 L = \u2205{1, . . . , k \u2212 1}\u2205L and L = 0\u2217 L \\ (0 \u2205).\nDefinition 2. A set X \u2282 N is said to be 2-star-free if \u03c12 (X) (or equivalently\n0\u2217 \u03c12 (X)) is a regular aperiodic language.\nIt is well-known that the 2-recognizable sets are exactly those definable\nin the first-order structure hN, +, V2 i (see [2, Theorem 6.1] or [8, 17]) where\nV2 (x) is the greatest power of 2 dividing x (and V2 (0) is 1). Thus X \u2282 N is\nsaid to be 2-definable if there exists a formula \u03c6 of hN, +, V2 i such that\nX = {n \u2208 N | hN, +, V2 i |= \u03c6(n)}.\nInstead of V2 (x), we shall use the binary relation \u01eb2 (x, y) defined by \"y\nis a power of 2 occurring in the normalized 2-representation of x\". As an\nexample (74, 8) belongs to \u01eb2 because \u03c12 (74) = 1001010 but (74, 16) and\n(74, 31) do not. Thus we can write\nX\nx=\ny.\n\u01eb2 (x,y)\n\nObserve also that (x, x) belongs to \u01eb2 if and only if x is a power of 2.\nRemark 3. The structures hN, +, V2 i and hN, +, \u01eb2 i are equivalent (i.e., for\nany formula \u03c6(n) of hN, +, V2 i there exists a formula \u03c6\u2032 (n) of hN, +, \u01eb2 i such\nthat {n \u2208 N | hN, +, V2 i |= \u03c6(n)} = {n \u2208 N | hN, +, \u01eb2 i |= \u03c6\u2032 (n)} and\nconversely). Indeed, \u01eb2 (x, y) is defined in hN, +, V2 i by\n(V2 (y) = y) \u2227 (\u2203z)(\u2203t)(x = t + y + z \u2227 z < y \u2227 (y < V2 (t) \u2228 t = 0))\nand V2 (x) = y is defined in hN, +, \u01eb2 i by\n\u01eb2 (x, y) \u2227 (\u2200z)(\u01eb2 (x, z) \u2192 y \u2264 z).\nTo be complete, notice that the binary relation < is definable in the Presburger arithmetic hN, +i by\nx < y \u2261 (\u2203z)(\u00ac(z = 0) \u2227 y = x + z).\nFor our purposes, we introduce a subset L2,n of formulas \u03c6(n) in hN, +, \u01eb2 i\ndefined as follows.\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n5\n\n3.1.

(when specified, b and n have some special role).\nRoughly speaking n is dedicated to be the only free variable and b plays the\nrole of an upper limit for all the bound variables occurring in a formula.\nThe only terms are the variables. The atomic formulas are obtained with\nthe following rules:\n1. If x and y are variables (6= b, n) then x < y and x = y are atomic\nformulas.\n2. if x is a variable (6= b, n) then \u01eb2 (n, x) is an atomic formula.\nIf \u03c6 is a formula whose x is a free variable (x 6= b, n) then\n(\u2203x)<b\n2 \u03c6 \u2261 (\u2203x)(\u01eb2 (x, x) \u2227 x < b \u2227 \u03c6)\nand\n(\u2200x)<b\n2 \u03c6 \u2261 (\u2200x)(\u01eb2 (x, x) \u2227 x < b \u2227 \u03c6)\nare formulas. To obtain formulas, we can also use the usual Boolean connectives \u00ac, \u2227, \u2228, \u2192, \u2194 either for formulas or atomic formulas. We are now\nable to define L2,n . If \u03c6 is a formula in which the only free variables are\n(possibly) n and b then\n(\u2203b)(\u01eb2 (b, b) \u2227 \u03c6)\nis a formula of L2,n having (possibly) a single free variable n.\nExample 4. The formula \u03c6(n) given by\n(2)\n\n\u03c6(n) \u2261(\u2203b){\u01eb2 (b, b) \u2227 (\u2203x)<b\n2 [\u01eb2 (n, x) \u2227\n<b\n(\u2200y)<b\n2 (x < y \u2192 \u01eb2 (n, y)) \u2227 (\u2200y)2 (y < x \u2192 \u00ac\u01eb2 (n, y))]}\n\nbelongs to L2,n . We shall see that the set X = {n | hN, +, \u01eb2 i |= \u03c6(n)}\nis such that \u03c12 (X) = 1+ 0\u2217 . Thus \u03c6(n) actually defines a 2-star-free set of\nintegers. As another example, the set Y of the powers of 2 is 2-star-free\nbecause \u03c12 (Y ) = 10\u2217 and it is also definable in L2,n by the formula\n(3)\n\n<b\n\u03c8(n) \u2261 (\u2203b)[\u01eb2 (b, b) \u2227 (\u2203x)<b\n2 (\u01eb2 (n, x) \u2227 (\u2200y)2 (\u01eb2 (n, y) \u2192 x = y))].\n\nWith this definition of L2,n , we obtain quite easily the following result.\nTheorem 5. A set X \u2286 N is 2-star-free (i.e., \u03c12 (X) is regular aperiodic)\nif and only if X is definable by a first-order formula of L2,n .\nProof. Let us first show that the condition is sufficient. Let X \u2286 N be a set\ndefined by a formula \u03c8 of L2,n . This formula is of the form\n\u03c8 \u2261 (\u2203b)(\u01eb2 (b, b) \u2227 \u03c6)\nand we can assume that \u03c8 has n as only free variable. (If \u03c8 is a sentence,\nthen X is equal to N or \u2205 and the result is obvious.) Let us now proceed to\nsome syntaxical transformations. In \u03c8, we keep only \u03c6 in which we replace\n<\n\u2032\n\u2032\neach occurrence of \u01eb2 (n, x), (\u2200x)<\n2 and (\u2203x)2 with respectively P1 (x ), (\u2200x )\n\u2032\n\u2032\nand (\u2203x ) . The remaining variables x are naturally replaced with x . It is\nclear that the obtained formula \u03c6\u2032 has no free variable and belongs to LSF .\nIndeed, n appears in \u03c6 only through terms of the form \u01eb2 (n, x). (As an\nexample, the reader can consider the formulas (2) and (1).) Therefore, \u03c6\u2032\ndefines a star-free language L over {0, 1}. To conclude this part of the proof,\nwe have to show that \u03c12 (X) = L. Let n be such that hN, +, \u01eb2 i |= \u03c8(n).\n\n\f6\n\nM. RIGO\n\nAssume that \u01eb2 (n, x) appears in \u03c6 with x = 2l for some l < log2 b because\n<\nx is within the scope of a quantifier (\u2200x)<\n2 or (\u2203x)2 . It means that \u03c12 (n)\nhas a 1 in the (l + 1)th position (counting positions from right to left and\nbeginning with 1). In \u03c6\u2032 corresponding to \u01eb2 (n, x), we have P1 (x\u2032 ) which\nmeans that the model of a word - i.e., the representation of an integer -\nsatisfying \u03c6\u2032 has a 1 in position x\u2032 . Thus, we obtain the result when x\u2032 is\nidentified as 1 + log2 x. The upper limit in \u03c8 given by b and appearing in\n<\n\u2032\nthe quantifiers (\u2200x)<\n2 and (\u2203x)2 is clearly understood in \u03c6 since in LSF we\nconsider words as finite models. It is the reason for removing the first part\nof \u03c8 to obtain \u03c6\u2032 and the constant max can be identified as log2 b.\nLet us now assume that X is a 2-star-free set. By McNaughton and\nPapert's theorem, \u03c12 (X) is defined by a sentence \u03c6 in LSF where the bound\nvariables are denoted x, y, z, . . . (6= n, b). In \u03c6, we replace (\u2200x), (\u2203x) and\n<\n\u2032\nP1 (x) with respectively (\u2200x)<\n2 , (\u2203x)2 and \u01eb2 (n, x) to obtain a formula \u03c8 . It\nis clear that\n\u03c8 \u2261 (\u2203b)(\u01eb2 (b, b) \u2227 \u03c8 \u2032 )\nis a formula of L2,n and has possibly n as single free variable. To conclude\nthe proof, it is clear that\nX = {n \u2208 N | hN, +, \u01eb2 i |= \u03c8(n)}.\nOne can view b as 2max if max is a constant of the finite model associated\nto a word.\nExample 6. The set 10\u2217 can be defined by the following formula of LSF\n(\u2203x)(P1 (x) \u2227 (\u2200y)(P1 (y) \u2192 x = y)).\nThe reader can check that this formula corresponds exactly to the formula\n(3) in L2,n if one proceeds to the transformations indicated in the second\npart of the proof.\nRemark 7. From the logical characterization of the 2-star-free sets given in\nthe previous theorem, other equivalent models can be obtained. In [2], it is\nshown how a finite automaton M can be effectively derived from a formula\n\u03c6 of hN, +, V2 i defining a 2-recognizable set X. Using classical results [4],\nit is also clear that the characteristic sequence of this X is 2-automatic and\nthe morphisms generating it can be derived from M and thus from \u03c6.\n4. Generalization to linear numeration systems\nFor the sake of simplicity, we have up to now considered the binary numeration system but Theorem 5 can be extended to more general numeration\nsystems.\nDefinition 8. A linear numeration system U is a strictly increasing sequence (Un )n\u2208N of integers such that U0 = 1, sup UUn+1\nis bounded and\nn\nsatisfying for all n \u2208 N a linear recurrence relation\nUn+k = ck\u22121 Un+k\u22121 + * * * + c0 Un , ci \u2208 Z, c0 6= 0.\nBy analogy to the binary system, the normalized representation of x is\ndenoted by \u03c1U (x) (with leading zeroes allowed) and VU (x) is the greatest\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n7\n\nUn appearing in the greedy decomposition of x with a non-zero coefficient\n(VU (0) = U0 = 1). A set X \u2286 N is U -recognizable if \u03c1U (X) is regular.\nIn the following, we shall only consider the class U of linear numeration\nsystems (Un )n\u2208N whose characteristic polynomial is the minimal polynomial\nof a Pisot number. For instance, the k-ary system and the Fibonacci system\nbelong to U . The choice of the class U relies mainly upon the following\nresult. If U = (Un )n\u2208N is a numeration system belonging to U then the U recognizable sets are exactly those definable in hN, +, VU i (see [1, Theorem\n16]). In fact, U is up to now the largest set of numeration systems having\nwell-known and useful properties such as the recognizability of addition.\nis bounded, the alphabet of the norLet U = (Un )n\u2208N \u2208 U . Since sup UUn+1\nn\nmalized representations is finite and is denoted AU = {0, . . . , c}. Naturally\nwords over AU will be interpreted as finite models (M, <, P1 , . . . , Pc , max)\nand the star-free languages are exactly those defined by first-order sentences\nin this formalism (the extension of LSF defined in Section 2.1 is left to the\nreader). As an example, if w = 1230112 then P1 = {2, 3, 7}, P2 = {1, 6} and\nP3 = {5}.\nInstead of VU (x), we shall use c binary relations \u01ebj,U (x, y), j = 1, . . . , c,\nmeaning that y is an element of the sequence (Un )n\u2208N appearing in the\nnormalized decomposition of x with a coefficient j. Thus\nc\nX\nX\nj y.\nx=\nj=1 \u01ebj,U (x,y)\n\nRemark 9. The structures hN, +, VU i and hN, +, \u01eb1,U , . . . , \u01ebc,U i are equivalent, \u01ebj,U (x, y) is defined by\n(VU (y) = y) \u2227 (\u2203t)(\u2203z)(x = t + j.y + z \u2227 z < y \u2227 (y < VU (t) \u2228 t = 0))\nand VU (x) = y by\n(\u01eb1,U (x, y) \u2228 * * * \u2228 \u01ebc,U (x, y)) \u2227 (\u2200z)((\u01eb1,U (x, z) \u2228 * * * \u2228 \u01ebc,U (x, z)) \u2192 y \u2264 z).\nBy analogy to L2,n introduced in the frame of the binary system, we can\ndefine a language LU,n of formulas in hN, +, \u01eb1,U , . . . , \u01ebc,U i having possibly\na single free variable n. For instance,\n(\u2203x)<\nU \u03c6 \u2261 (\u2203x)(\u01eb1,U (x, x) \u2227 x < b \u2227 \u03c6).\nThe reader could easily make up the complete definition of LU,n .\nLet us just introduce two notations, if \u03c6 is any formula of LU,n , we shall\ndenote by P(\u03c6) the main part of the formula (i.e., the largest sub-formula\nin which b is still free), namely the formula is necessarily of the form\n\u03c6 \u2261 (\u2203b)(\u01eb1,U (b, b) \u2227 P(\u03c6)).\nIf \u03c1U (N) is aperiodic then it is definable by a sentence X of LSF . In X, we\n<\nreplace Pj (x), (\u2200x) and (\u2203x) with \u01ebj,U (n, x), (\u2200x)<\nU and (\u2203x)U respectively\nto obtain a formula XN being the main part of a formula in LU,n .\nTheorem 10. Let U be a numeration system in U . If NU = 0\u2217 \u03c1U (N) is\naperiodic then a set X \u2286 N is U -star-free (i.e., \u03c1U (X) is regular aperiodic)\nif and only if X is definable by a first-order formula of LU,n of the form\n(\u2203b)(\u01eb1,U (b, b) \u2227 P(\u03c6) \u2227 XN )\n\n\f8\n\nM. RIGO\n\nwhere \u03c6 is a first-order formula of LU,n .\nProof. The only differences with the proof of Theorem 5 appear when we\nshow that the condition is sufficient. Roughly speaking, we should have to\nbe careful for the choice of a formula \u03c6 in LU,n because we want to obtain\na corresponding formula in LSF valid only for normalized representations\ninterpreted as finite models. To avoid this problem we use the formula XN .\nLet \u03c6 be any formula of LU,n . It is necessarily of the form\n(\u2203b)(\u01eb1,U (b, b) \u2227 P(\u03c6)).\nAssuming that XN and P(\u03c6) have different variables except for n and b then\n\u03c8 \u2261 (\u2203b)(\u01eb1,U (b, b) \u2227 P(\u03c6) \u2227 XN )\nis again a formula of LU,n . Adding the part XN in such a formula \u03c8 ensures\nthat if we transform \u03c8 into a sentence \u03c8 \u2032 of LSF (following the scheme given\nin the proof of Theorem 5) then the words satisfying \u03c8 \u2032 are all normalized\nU -representations and the corresponding language is aperiodic.\nRemark 11. Notice that for the k-ary system, the set of all the normalized\nk-representations (allowing leading zeroes) is aperiodic\n0\u2217 \u03c1k (N) = {0, . . . , k \u2212 1}\u2217 = \u2205\nand any word of \u03a3k is a valid normalized k-representation. So in this special\ncase, we do not need a formula XN . To be precise, XN is a tautology. In\nparticular, this explains the simpler form of Theorem 5 which holds for any\nnumeration system with an integer base k.\nExample 12. Let us consider the Fibonacci system given by U0 = 1, U1 = 2\nand Un+2 = Un+1 + Un . As a consequence of the greedy algorithm,\nNU = \u220511\u2205\nis aperiodic and defined by the following sentence of LSF\nX \u2261 (\u2200x)(\u2200y)[(\u2203z)(x < z < y) \u2228 \u00ac(P1 (x) \u2227 P1 (y))]\ncorresponding to\n<\n<\nXN \u2261 (\u2200x)<\nU (\u2200y)U [(\u2203z)U (x < z < y) \u2228 \u00ac(\u01eb1,U (x) \u2227 \u01eb1,U (y))].\n\nSo any formula \u03c6 of LU,n gives a new formula\n(\u2203b)(\u01eb1,U (b, b) \u2227 P(\u03c6) \u2227 XN )\ndefining a U -star-free subset of N (which could be finite or empty depending\non the compatibility of the conditions given by P(\u03c6) and XN ).\nContinuing this example, we show that the set of even integers is not\nU -star-free although it is easily definable in the Presburger arithmetic by\n\u03c6(n) \u2261 (\u2203x)(n = x + x).\nIndeed, Un is even if and only if n \u2261 1 (mod 3) and therefore, for any n, two\nbut not the three words 1(01)n , 1(01)n+1 and 1(01)n+2 are in the language\n\u03c1U (N). So the set of even integers is not definable in LU,n .\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n9\n\n5. Base dependence\nIn this section, we consider once again integer base numeration systems\nand study the base dependence of the star-free property. We show that the\nsets of integers are classified into four categories.\nThe proof of the first result in this section does not use the previous logical\ncharacterization of the p-star-free sets but relies mainly on automata theory\narguments.\nProposition 13. Let p, k \u2265 2. A set X \u2286 N is p-star-free if and only if it\nis pk -star-free.\nProof. Let us first show that if X \u2286 N is pk -star-free then X is p-star-free.\nAssume that \u03c1pk (X) is obtained by an extended regular expression over the\nalphabet \u03a3pk = {0, . . . , pk \u2212 1} without star operation. In this expression,\none can replace each occurrence of a letter j \u2208 \u03a3pk with the word 0k\u2212l \u03c1p (j)\n(l = |\u03c1p (j)|) of length k. Since we only use concatenation product, the\nresulting expression defining the language L \u2282 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}\u2217 is still starfree and it is clear that \u03c1p (X) = L.\nExample 14. The set X = {3.4n | n \u2208 N} is 4-star-free,\n\u03c14 (X) = 3 0\u2217 = {3} \u2205{1, 2, 3}\u2205.\nThe set X is also 2-star-free, we simply have to replace, 0, 1, 2 and 3 with\nrespectively 00, 01, 10 and 11 and\n\u03c12 (X) = 11 (00)\u2217 = {11} \u2205{01, 10, 11}\u2205.\nBefore continuing the proof, we recall another characterization of the\nstar-free languages given by McNaughton and Papert.\nDefinition 15. A deterministic finite automaton is permutation free if there\nis no word that makes a nontrivial permutation (i.e., not the identity permutation) of any subset of the set of states. In the same way, a language is\nsaid to be permutation free if its minimal automaton is permutation free.\nExample 16. The automaton depicted in Figure 1 is not permutation free.\nIndeed, the word 01 makes a non trivial permutation of the set {p, r}.\n\n0\n1\n\nq\n\n0\np\n\n1\n0\n\n1\n\n0\n\nr\n\n1\n\ns\nFigure 1. A non permutation free automaton.\n\nTheorem 17. [12, Theorem 5.1] A language is star-free if and only if it is\npermutation free.\n\n\f10\n\nM. RIGO\n\nLet us also recall a well-known result from automata theory.\nProposition 18. [5, Section III.5] Let L \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 be a regular language having\nML = (QL , q0 , FL , \u03a3, \u03b4L ) as minimal automaton. If M = (Q, q0\u2032 , F, \u03a3, \u03b4)\nis an accessible deterministic automaton recognizing L then there exists an\napplication \u03a6 : Q \u2192 QL such that \u03a6 is onto and for each q \u2208 Q and w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 ,\n\u03a6(\u03b4(q, w)) = \u03b4L (\u03a6(q), w).\nAssume now that X \u2286 N is p-star-free. Using Remark 1 and Theorem 17, 0\u2217 \u03c1p (X) is a permutation free language and we denote by M =\n(Q, q0 , F, \u03a3p , \u03b4) its minimal automaton. From M, we build a new automaton M\u2032 = (Q, q0 , F, \u03a3pk , \u03b4\u2032 ) having the same set of states. The transition\nfunction \u03b4\u2032 of M\u2032 is defined as follows. For each j \u2208 \u03a3pk , p, q \u2208 Q, let\nw = 0k\u2212l \u03c1p (j) where l = |\u03c1p (j)|, then \u03b4\u2032 (p, j) = q if and only if \u03b4(p, w) = q.\nExample 19. Let \u03a32 = {0, 1} and consider the automaton M depicted\nin Figure 2. If we consider the 4-ary numeration system, we build a new\n\n0\n\n0,1\n\n0\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 2. An automaton M over \u03a32 .\nautomaton M\u2032 depicted in Figure 3 by considering in M the paths of label\n00, 01, 10 and 11 replaced respectively by 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\n0,2\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0,1,2,3\n\n2,3\n\n1\n3\n\nFigure 3. The corresponding automaton M\u2032 over \u03a34 .\nThe automaton M\u2032 is accessible. Let q \u2208 Q. Since M is accessible, there\nexists a word w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217p such that \u03b4(q0 , w) = q. Observe that in M, we have\na loop of label 0 in the initial state q0 . So for any n \u2208 N, \u03b4(q0 , 0n w) = q.\nChoose n such that |0n w| = ik. The word 0n w corresponds to a word\nw\u2032 \u2208 (\u03a3pk )i and \u03b4\u2032 (q0 , w\u2032 ) = q. So M\u2032 is accessible.\nThe automaton M\u2032 is permutation free. Assume the contrary. If there\nexists T \u2286 Q and a word w\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217pk such that w\u2032 makes a nontrivial permutation of T . Then w\u2032 corresponds to a word w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217p producing a nontrivial\npermutation in the same subset T of the set of states of M. This is a\ncontradiction.\nIt is clear from the construction of M\u2032 , that this automaton accepts exactly the language 0\u2217 \u03c1pk (X). The only remaining problem before being able\nto apply Theorem 17 is that M\u2032 is not necessarily reduced. Indeed, due to\nits definition, through M\u2032 we only look in M at words of length ik, i \u2265 0.\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n11\n\nLet M\u2032\u2032 = (Q\u2032\u2032 , q0\u2032\u2032 , F \u2032\u2032 , \u03a3pk , \u03b4\u2032\u2032 ) be the minimal automaton of 0\u2217 \u03c1pk (X).\nThanks to Proposition 18, we have an onto application \u03a6 between the automata M\u2032 and M\u2032\u2032 namely between the sets Q and Q\u2032\u2032 . To conclude the\nproof by applying Theorem 17, we have to show that M\u2032\u2032 is permutation\nfree. Assume that there exists a subset T of Q\u2032\u2032 and a word w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217pk such\nthat w makes a nontrivial permutation of T . So there exists a state q \u2208 T\nsuch that \u03b4\u2032\u2032 (q, w) \u2208 T and \u03b4\u2032\u2032 (q, w) 6= q. Therefore M\u2032 is not permutation\nfree, w makes a nontrivial permutation of \u03a6\u22121 (T ) \u2286 Q. Indeed, there exist\nr \u2208 \u03a6\u22121 (q) \u2286 \u03a6\u22121 (T ) and s \u2208 \u03a6\u22121 (\u03b4\u2032\u2032 (q, w)) \u2286 \u03a6\u22121 (T ) such that r 6= s and\n\u03b4\u2032 (r, w) = s. This is a contradiction because we have shown previously that\nM\u2032 is permutation free.\nIt is well-known that any finite union of arithmetic progressions is p-starfree for some p (see [10, Theorem 1.4]). So a natural question is to determine\nif an arithmetic progression r + s N = {r + sn | n \u2208 N}, s > 1, is p-star-free\nfor any p \u2265 2 or only for some specific bases p.\nExample 20. The set of even integers is 2-star-free and therefore 2n -starfree for each n. But this set is not 3-star-free, indeed \u03c13 (2N) is the set of\nwords over {0, 1, 2} having an even number of 1 (and therefore the minimal\nautomaton of this language is not counter-free, which is another way to say\nthat the language is not permutation free). Notice also that 2 and 10 are\nmultiplicatively independent but 2N is 10-star-free. Actually, it is easy to\nsee that the set of even integers is (2p)-star-free, for any p. So with this\nexample, we see that we obtain a slighty different phenomenom that the one\nencountered in Cobham's theorem.\nA finite union of arithmetic progressions being ultimately periodic, we\ncan always write it as \u222aqj=1 (rj + s N) \u222a F where F is a finite set and s is\nthe l.c.m. of the periods of the different progressions. Since aperiodicity is\npreserved up to a finite modification of a language, we can forget the finite\nset F and assume that rj < s. Union of aperiodic sets being again aperiodic,\nwe shall consider a single set r + s N.\nProposition 21. The set r + s N, (with r < s and s > 1) is (is)-star-free\nfor any integer i > 0.\nProof. The reader can easily check that the language made up of the (is)-ary\nexpansions of the elements in r + s N is\n\u03a3\u2217is {r, r + s, . . . , r + (i \u2212 1)s}\nwhich is a definite1 language.\nWe even have a better situation.\nProposition 22. Let r + s N be such that r < s, s > 1 and the factorization\nof s as a product of primes is of the form\ns = p\u03b11 1 * * * p\u03b1k k , \u03b1i > 0\nIf P = \u03a0kj=1 pj then r + s N is (iP )-star-free for any integer i > 0.\n1\nA language L \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 is said to be definite if there exist finite languages M and N such\nthat L = N \u222a \u03a3\u2217 M . So to test the membership of a word in L, we only have to look at\nits last letters.\n\n\f12\n\nM. RIGO\n\nProof. Let \u03b1 = supj=1,... ,k \u03b1j . By definition of P , it is clear that (iP )\u03b1+n is\na multiple of s for all integers n \u2265 0 and i > 0. So in the (iP )-ary expansion\nof an integer the digits corresponding to those powers of iP provide the\ndecomposition with multiples of s. To obtain an element of r + s N, we\nthus have to focus on the last \u03b1 digits corresponding to the powers 1, iP ,\n. . . ,(iP )\u03b1\u22121 of weakest weight. Consider the finite set\nY = {r + ns | n \u2208 N and r + ns < (iP )\u03b1 }.\nFor each yj \u2208 Y , j = 1, . . . , t, consider the word \u03c1iP (yj ) preceded by some\nzeroes to obtain a word yj\u2032 \u2208 \u03a3\u2217iP of length \u03b1. To conclude the proof, observe\nthat the language made up of the (iP )-ary expansions of the elements in\nr + s N is\n\u03a3\u2217iP {y1\u2032 , . . . , yt\u2032 }\nand is a definite language.\nRemark 23. The situation of Proposition 22 cannot be improved. Indeed\nwith the previous notations, consider an integer Q which is a product of\nsome but not all the prime factors appearing in s. For the sake of simplicity,\nassume that\nQ = p\u03b22 2 * * * p\u03b2k k , 1 \u2264 \u03b2j \u2264 \u03b1j .\nFor each n, Qn 6\u2261 0 (mod s). Indeed, if Qn = i s then\nk\n= i p\u03b11 1 * * * p\u03b1k k\np2n\u03b22 * * * pn\u03b2\nk\n\nwhich is a contradiction since p1 does not appear in the left hand side factorization. Moreover, it is clear that the sequence (Qn mod s)n\u2208N is ultimately\nperiodic. Therefore \u03c1Q (r + s N) is regular but not star-free because, due to\nthis periodicity, the corresponding automaton is not counter-free. As an\nexample, one can check that 6N is neither 2-star-free nor 3-star-free.\nTo summarize the situation, the sets of integers can be classified into four\ncategories:\n1. The finite and cofinite sets are p-star-free for any p > 1.\n2. The ultimately periodic sets of period s = p\u03b11 1 * * * p\u03b1k k > 1 are (iP )star-free for P = \u03a0kj=1 pj and any i > 0. In particular, these sets are\nP m -star-free for m \u2265 1.\n3. Thanks to Cobham's theorem, if a p-recognizable set X is not a finite\nunion of arithmetic progressions then X is only pk -recognizable for\nk \u2265 1 (p being simple2 ). So if a p-star-free set X is not ultimately\nperiodic then X is only pk -star-free for k \u2265 1 (p being simple).\n4. Finally, there are sets which are not p-star-free for any p > 1.\n2\nBeing multiplicatively dependent is an equivalence relation over N, the smallest element in an equivalence class is said to be simple. For instance, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 are\nsimple.\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n13\n\n6. p-adic number systems\nThe p-ary numeration system is built upon the the sequence Un = pn and\nthe representation of an integer is a word over the alphabet {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}\ncomputed through the greedy algorithm. On the other hand, the p-adic\nnumeration system is built upon the same sequence but representations are\nwritten over the alphabet {1, . . . , p}. It can be shown that each integer has\na unique p-adic representation (see [13] for an exposition on p-adic number\nsystems). For instance, the use of p-adic system may be relevant to remove\nthe ambiguity due to the presence of leading zeroes in a p-ary representation.\nIndeed, 0 is not a valid digit in a p-adic representation (see for instance [9,\np. 303] for a relation to L systems).\nIn this small section, we show that the p-star-free sets are exactly the sets\nof integers whose p-adic representations made up a star-free language.\nCapital Greek letters will represent finite alphabets.\nIf \u2206 \u2282 Z is a finite alphabet and w = wn * * * w0 is a finite word over \u2206,\nwe denote by \u03c0p (w) the numerical value of w,\n\u03c0p (w) =\n\nn\nX\n\nwi pi .\n\ni=0\n\nFor instance, 1001 and 121 are respectively the 2-ary and 2-adic representations of 9,\n\u03c02 (1001) = \u03c02 (121) = 9.\nLet w \u2208 \u2206\u2217 be such that \u03c0p (w) \u2208 N. The partial function \u03bdp : \u2206\u2217 \u2192\n{0, . . . , p \u2212 1}\u2217 mapping w onto \u03c1p (\u03c0p (w)) is called the normalization function. Thanks to a result of C. Frougny, the graph of this function is regular\nwhatever the alphabet \u2206 is [7]. For the case we are interested in, the language\n\u03bdbp R = {(u, v) | u \u2208 {1, . . . , p}\u2217 0\u2217 , v \u2208 \u03a3\u2217p , |u| = |v|, \u03c0p (uR ) = \u03c0p (v R )}\n\nis the reversal of the graph of the normalization funciton mapping the p-adic\nrepresentation of an integer onto its p-ary representation. The trim minimal\nautomaton (the sink has not been represented) of \u03bdbp R is given in Figure 4\nand is clearly permutation free. So thanks to Theorem 17, \u03bdbp R is star-free.\n\n(1,1),...,\n(p\u22121,p\u22121)\n\n(p\u22121,0)\n(p,1)\n\n(0,0)\n\n(p,0)\n(0,1)\n(1,2),...,(p\u22122,p\u22121)\nFigure 4. From p-adic to p-ary representation.\nLemma 24. A language L \u2286 \u03a3\u2217 is star-free if and only if LR is star-free.\n\n\f14\n\nM. RIGO\n\nProof. Let u, v, w \u2208 \u03a3\u2217 . Assume that L is aperiodic, for n large enough\nu v n w \u2208 LR \u21d4 wR (v R )n uR \u2208 L\n\u21d4 wR (v R )n+1 uR \u2208 L\n\u21d4 u v n+1 w \u2208 LR .\nThus \u03bdbp is a star-free language.\nWe denote by p1 and p2 the canonical homomorphisms of projection, if A\nand B are sets, p1 : A \u00d7 B \u2192 A : (a, b) 7\u2192 a and p2 : A \u00d7 B \u2192 B : (a, b) 7\u2192 b.\nLemma 25. Let L \u2286 \u03a3\u2217 be a star-free language. Then the language\nL \u2295 \u0393\u2217 = {(x, y) | x \u2208 L, y \u2208 \u0393\u2217 , |x| = |y|}\nis also star-free.\nProof. Let u, v, w \u2208 (\u03a3 \u00d7 \u0393)\u2217 . Since L is star-free and p1 and p2 are letterto-letter (length preserving homomorphisms), we have\nu v n w \u2208 L \u2295 \u0393\u2217 \u21d4 p1 (u v n w) \u2208 L & p2 (u v n w) \u2208 \u0393\u2217\n\u21d4 p1 (u) p1 (v)n p1 (w) \u2208 L & p2 (u) p2 (v)n p2 (w) \u2208 \u0393\u2217\n\u21d4 p1 (u) p1 (v)n+1 p1 (w) \u2208 L & p2 (u) p2 (v)n+1 p2 (w) \u2208 \u0393\u2217\n\u21d4 p1 (u v n+1 w) \u2208 L & p2 (u v n+1 w) \u2208 \u0393\u2217\n\u21d4 u v n+1 w \u2208 L \u2295 \u0393\u2217\n\nNaturally, we can also define the language \u0393\u2217 \u2295 L in a similar way.\nGenerally, the homomorphic image of a star-free language is not star-free\n[12, p. 12] but the following weaker result holds.\nLemma 26. If a language L \u2282 (\u03a3 \u00d7 \u0393)\u2217 of couples of words of the same\nlength is star-free then p1 (L) \u2282 \u03a3\u2217 and p2 (L) \u2282 \u0393\u2217 are also star-free.\nProof. One can apply the same reasoning as the one given in the proof of\nthe previous lemma.\nWe are now able to prove the main result of this section (notice that a\nsmall mention to p-adic systems appears also in [11]).\nProposition 27. A set X \u2286 N is p-star-free if and only if the language\nmade up of the p-adic representations of the elements in X is star-free.\nProof. If \u03c1p (X) is a star-free language then thanks to Lemma 25,\n{0, . . . , p}\u2217 \u2295 \u03c1p (X)\nis star-free. Thanks to Lemma 24 and since the family of aperiodic languages\nis closed under boolean operations, the language\nL = [{0, . . . , p}\u2217 \u2295 \u03c1p (X)] \u2229 \u03bdbp\n\nis again star-free. To conclude the first part of the proof, we apply Lemma\n26, p1 (L) is star-free and it is clear that this language is exactly made up of\nthe p-adic representations of the elements in X.\n\n\fSTAR-FREE SETS OF INTEGERS\n\n15\n\nConversely, let M \u2282 {1, . . . , p}\u2217 be such that \u03c0p (M ) = X. If M is starfree then thanks to Remark 1 and using the previous lemmas,\nis star-free.\n\np2 [(0\u2217 M \u2295 {0, . . . , p \u2212 1}\u2217 ) \u2229 \u03bdbp ]\n7.
