Let {\u03c6s }s\u2208S be a commutative semigroup of completely positive,\ncontractive, and weak*-continuous linear maps acting on a von Neumann algebra N . Assume there exists a semigroup {\u03b1s }s\u2208S of weak*-continuous \u2217endomorphisms of some larger von Neumann algebra M \u2283 N and a projection\np \u2208 M with N = pM p such that \u03b1s (1 \u2212 p) \u2264 1 \u2212 p for every s \u2208 S and\n\u03c6s (y) = p\u03b1s (y)p for all y \u2208 N . If inf s\u2208S \u03b1s (1 \u2212 p) = 0 then we show that\nthe map E : M \u2192 N defined by E(x) = pxp for x \u2208 M induces a complete\nisometry between the fixed point spaces of {\u03b1s }s\u2208S and {\u03c6s }s\u2208S .\n\nLet (S, +, 0) be a commutative semigroup with unit 0. Consider the partial preorder on S induced by the semigroup structure as follows. If s, t \u2208 S then s \u2264 t if\nand only if there exists r \u2208 S such that s + r = t. If X is a Hausdorff topological\nspace and f : S \u2192 X is a function, , then lims\u2208S f (s) denotes its limit along the\ndirected set (S, \u2264), whenever this limit exists.\nLet M be a von Neumann algebra. Let CP (M ) denote the semigroup of all\ncompletely positive, contractive and weak*-continuous linear maps \u03b2 : M \u2192 M .\nLet also End(M ) be the semigroup of all weak*-continuous *-endomorphisms of\nM . A family {\u03b2s }s\u2208S \u2282 CP (M ) is called a semigroup if the map s 7\u2192 \u03b2s is a unital\nhomomorphism of semigroups from S into CP (M ).\nSuppose now that {\u03b1s }s\u2208S \u2282 End(M ) is a semigroup. Let p be an orthogonal\nprojection in M such that\n\u03b1s (1 \u2212 p) \u2264 1 \u2212 p\n\n\u2200s \u2208 S.\n\nThen one can define, for every s \u2208 S, a completely positive mapping on the von\nNeumann algebra N = pM p as follows:\n\u03c6s (x) = p\u03b1s (x)p\n\n\u2200x \u2208 N.\n\nIt is clear that {\u03c6s }s\u2208S \u2282 CP (N ). A short calculation shows that\n\u03c6s (pxp) = p\u03b1s (x)p\n\n\u2200x \u2208 M,\n\nand using this, one can show that {\u03c6s }s\u2208S is a semigroup. According to the terminology used in Chapter 8 of [1], where this construction is given for one-parameter\nsemigroups, {\u03b1s }s\u2208S is a dilation of {\u03c6s }s\u2208S and p is a co-invariant projection for\n{\u03b1s }s\u2208S .\nWe shall prove the following result, which shows that, under a suitable minimality\ncondition, the fixed point spaces of {\u03b1s }s\u2208S and {\u03c6s }s\u2208S are completely isometric.\nWe point out that the minimality condition is always satisfied by the minimal Edilation of a CP-semigroup as constructed in [1].\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

First,we show that E(M \u03b1 ) = N \u03c6 . It is clear that E(M \u03b1 ) \u2282 N \u03c6 . Let \u03bc be\nan invariant mean on S. This means that \u03bc is a state on the von Neumann algebra\nl\u221e (S) of all complex-valued bounded functions on S that remains invariant under\ntranslations. It is well known [5] that any commutative semigroup is amenable, in\nthe sense that it admits invariant means.\nLet y \u2208 N \u03c6 . For each \u03b3 in the predual M\u2217 of M , let f\u03b3 \u2208 l\u221e (S) be defined by\nf\u03b3 (s) = (\u03b1s (y), \u03b3)\n\ns \u2208 S.\n\nThen there exists z \u2208 M such that\n(z, \u03b3) = \u03bc(f\u03b3 )\n\n\u2200\u03b3 \u2208 M\u2217 .\n\nSince \u03b1s are weak * continuous and {\u03b1s }s\u2208S is a semigroup, it follows that z \u2208 M \u03b1 .\nMoreover pzp = y and this shows that E(M \u03b1 ) = N \u03c6 .\nIn order to go further, we need to use the minimality assumption on {\u03b1s }s\u2208S .\nSuppose now that w \u2208 M \u03b1 . Since inf t\u2208S \u03b1t (1 \u2212 p) = 0 we see that\nso \u2212 lim \u03b1s (pwp) = w.\ns\u2208S\n\n\fLIFTING FIXED POINTS\n\n3\n\nSince E(M \u03b1 ) = N \u03c6 it follows that the limit\n\u03c0(y) = so \u2212 lim \u03b1s (y)\ns\u2208S\n\n\u03c6\n\nexists for every y \u2208 N and that \u03c0 \u25e6 E = id on M \u03b1 . In particular E is completely\nisometric on M \u03b1 . All the other assertions are straightforward consequences of what\nwe have already proved.\n\u0003\nThis result and its proof provide, in particular, an alternate and simplified approach to the lifting theorem for fixed points of completely positive maps from [6].\nIn the case when S is either a commutative, countable and cancellative semigroup\nor S = Rd+ for some d \u2265 1, and {\u03b1s }s\u2208S are unit preserving, part 2 of Theorem 1\nfollows directly from Proposition 4.4 together with Theorem 4.5 from [4]. In the\ncase when {\u03c6s }s\u2208S is the semigroup induced by the unilateral shift on the Hardy\nspace H 2 , the existence of the limit in part 3 of Theorem 1 is proved in [2].\nWe close with the following result which shows that part 3 of the previous theorem holds true even without assuming the existence of a dilation.\nTheorem 2. Let N \u2282 B(H) be a von Neumann algebra on some Hilbert space H.\nLet (S, +, 0) be a commutative semigroup with unit. Let {\u03c6s }s\u2208S be a semigroup of\ncompletely positive, contractive and weak*-continuous linear maps on N . Let\nN \u03c6 = {x \u2208 N : \u03c6t (x) = x, \u2200t \u2208 S}\nand let C \u2217 (N \u03c6 ) be the C \u2217 -subalgebra of N generated by N \u03c6 . Then for each y \u2208\nC \u2217 (N \u03c6 ) there exists the strong-operator limit\n\u03a6(y) = so \u2212 lim \u03c6s (y)\ns\u2208S\n\nand the map y 7\u2192 \u03a6(y) is completely positive, contractive, idempotent, and moreover\nRan(\u03a6) = N \u03c6 .\nProof. Let \u03bc be an invariant mean on S. Let y \u2208 N . For each \u03b3 in the predual N\u2217\nof N , let f\u03b3 \u2208 l\u221e (S) be defined by\nf\u03b3 (s) = (\u03c6s (y), \u03b3)\n\ns \u2208 S.\n\nThen there exists z \u2208 N such that\n(z, \u03b3) = \u03bc(f\u03b3 )\n\n\u2200\u03b3 \u2208 N\u2217 .\n\nSince {\u03c6s }s\u2208S are weak* continuous and {\u03c6s }s\u2208S is a semigroup, it follows that\nz \u2208 N \u03c6 . Let us denote z = \u03c1(y). The mapping \u03c1 : N \u2192 N is completely positive,\ncontractive, idempotent, and Ran(\u03c1) = N \u03c6 . Moreover\n\u03c6s \u25e6 \u03c1 = \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c6s = \u03c1.\nLet \u03a6 : C (N ) \u2192 N be the restriction of \u03c1 to C \u2217 (N \u03c6 ). A well known result from\n[3] shows that\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03a6(\u03a6(x)y) = \u03a6(\u03a6(x)\u03a6(y))\n\n\u2200x, y \u2208 C \u2217 (N \u03c6 ).\n\nThis easily implies that ker(\u03a6) is the closed left ideal in C \u2217 (N \u03c6 ) generated by all\nthe operators of the form xy \u2212 \u03a6(xy) with x, y \u2208 N \u03c6 . Moreover by polarization we\nsee that ker\u03a6 is the closed ideal of C \u2217 (N \u03c6 ) generated by all the operators of the\nform x\u2217 x \u2212 \u03a6(x\u2217 x) with x \u2208 N \u03c6 .\n\n\f4\n\nBEBE PRUNARU\n\nLet x \u2208 N \u03c6 . Since {\u03c6s }s\u2208S are completely positive, they satisfy the KadisonSchwarz inequality,therefore\n\u03c6s (x\u2217 x) \u2212 x\u2217 x \u2265 0\nfor all s \u2208 S hence the net {\u03c6s (x\u2217 x)}s\u2208S is monotone increasing. It follows from\nthe way \u03a6 is constructed that\n\u03a6(x\u2217 x) = so \u2212 lim \u03c6s (x\u2217 x).\ns\u2208S\n\nLet y = \u03a6(x\u2217 x) \u2212 x\u2217 x. It follows that\nso \u2212 lim \u03c6s (y) = 0.\ns\u2208S\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c6\n\nLet a \u2208 C (N ) and let h \u2208 H. Then\nk\u03c6s (ay 1/2 )hk2 \u2264 (\u03c6s (y 1/2 a\u2217 ay 1/2 )h, h) \u2264 kak2 (\u03c6s (y)h, h).\nThis shows that lims\u2208S k\u03c6s (z)hk = 0 for every z \u2208 ker \u03a6 therefore\n\u03a6(w) = so \u2212 lim \u03c6s (w)\ns\u2208S\n\nfor every w \u2208 C \u2217 (N \u03c6 ). This completes the proof.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] W. Arveson, Noncommutative dynamics and E-semigroups, Springer Monographs in\nMathematics, Springer-Verlag, New York, 2003.\n[2] J. Barria and P. R.
