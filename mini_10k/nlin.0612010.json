As a model to study some minimal conditions for the emergence of collective behavior in\na chaotic network, we consider the coupled map system\n\u001a\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)f (xit ) + \u01ebht , with probability p,\nxit+1 =\nf (xit ),\nwith probability 1 \u2212 p,\n(1)\nwhere xit (i = 1, 2, . . . , N ; N = system size) gives the\nstate of the ith element at discrete time t; \u01eb is the coupling strength, f is a map defining the local dynamics,\nand\n\n2\n\nN\n1 X\nht =\nf (xit )\nN i=1\n\n(2)\n\nis the instantaneous mean field of the system that provides a global coupling. The parameter p is the probability of connection of an element to the mean field at\ntime t. Thus the average fraction of globally connected\nelements at any given time is p.\nAs local dynamics in Eq. (1) we shall consider the\nlogarithmic map f (x) = b + log |x| [2], where b is a real\nparameter and x \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). This map exhibits robust\nchaos, with no periodic windows and no separated chaotic\nbands, in the parameter interval b \u2208 [\u22121, 1].\nA synchronized state at time t is defined by the condition xit = xjt , \u2200i, j, in which case the dynamics is described by the single map xt+1 = f (xt ). The synchronization of the elements in the network can be characterized by the time-average h\u03c3i of the instantaneous standard deviations \u03c3t of the distribution of site variables xit ,\ndefined as\nN\n\u00012\n1 X\n\u03c3t =\nf (xit ) \u2212 ht\nN i=1\n\n\"\n\n\u01eb. There is a threshold value pc \u2243 0.75 at which h\u03c3i = 0\n(within a precision of 10\u22128 in our calculations), indicating that the elements are synchronized. The range of\np where chaotic synchronization takes place is indicated\nby the label S. For p = 1, the system Eq. (1) becomes\na globally coupled map network [3] which is known to\nsynchronize. However, Fig. 1 reveals that the reinjection\nof a global coupling function to a fraction of randomly\nselected elements in the system is enough to achieve synchronization. The critical value pc for the emergence of\nsynchronization depends on the parameters of the system, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\n#1/2\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nFigure 1 shows the quantity h\u03c3i (right vertical axis) as\na function of the probability p, for fixed values of b and\n\n1.2\nT\n\nNTCB\n\nCB\n\nS\n\n0\n0.8\n\nh\u03c3i\n\nht\n-2\n0.4\n\n-4\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\np\nFIG. 1: Left vertical axis: bifurcation diagram of ht as a function of p. For each value of p, the mean field was calculated\nat each time step during a run starting from random initial\nconditions on the local maps, uniformly distributed on the\ninterval [\u22128, 8], after discarding the transients. The regions\nwhere collective states occur are labeled T (turbulent), NTCB\n(nontrivial collective behavior), CB (chaotic bands), S (synchronization). Right vertical axis: h\u03c3i vs p, continuous line.\nFixed b = \u22120.7, \u01eb = 0.4; size N = 105 .\n\n\f2\nThe instantaneous mean field of the system ht can\ncharacterize more complex collective behaviors arising in\nthe system Eq. (1). When b \u2208 [\u22121, 1], the elements in\nthe network are chaotic and desynchronized. However,\nfor some parameter values, ht reveals the existence of\nglobal periodic attractors. Figure 1 shows the bifurcation diagram of ht (left vertical axis) as a function of p,\nfor fixed b and \u01eb. In this representation, collective periodic states at a given value of the parameter p appear\nas sets of small vertical segments which correspond to\nintrinsic fluctuations of the periodic orbits of the mean\nfield.\nIn the region labelled by T (turbulent) in Fig. 1, ht follows a normal statistical behavior around a mean value\n(a collective fixed point) with fluctuations reflecting the\naveraging of N completely desynchronized chaotic elements. Increasing the probability of connection p induces\na transition to periodic collective states occurring in the\nchaotic range of the local dynamics: a pitchfork bifurcation takes place from a collective fixed point to a collective period-two state (a state for which the time series of\nht alternatingly moves between the corresponding neighborhoods of two separate values). Collective states of\nhigher periodicity arise by further increasing p: global\nperiodic attractors of period 2, 4, 8, and 16 are possible\nin this system. The amplitude of the collective periodic\nmotions manifested in ht do not decrease with an increase in the system size N . As a consequence, the variance of ht itself does not decay as N \u22121 with increasing\nN but rather it saturates at some constant value related\nto the amplitude of the collective period. This is a phenomenon of nontrivial collective behavior, where macroscopic quantities in a spatiotemporal dynamical system\nexhibit ordered evolution coexisting with local chaos [4].\nNote that the emergence of collective periodic behavior in\nthis system cannot be attributed to the presence of periodic windows in the local dynamics since the logarithmic\nmap possesses robust chaos for b \u2208 [\u22121, 1]. Figure 1 indicates with the label NTCB the interval of p where nontrivial collective behavior arises in this system. Before\ncrossing the boundary of the synchronization region, the\ncollective states described by ht take the form of chaotic\nbands. These states are labelled CB (collective bands)\nand they consist of the motion of chaotic elements that\nmaintain some coherence.\nFigure 2 shows the regions where the different collective states of the system Eq. (1) occur on the space of\n\n[1] M. Newman, A. Barabasi, and D. J. Watts, The structure\nand Dynamics of Networks, (Princeton University Press,\nPrinceton, NJ, 2006).\n[2] T. Kawabe and Y.

These regions are separated by stability boundaries which have been numerically calculated.\nFor p = 1, Fig. 2 yields the intervals of stability of the\ncollective states S, NTCB and CB corresponding to globally coupled logarithmic maps and which have been previously found [5]. Figure 2 shows that those collective\nstates can also emerge when a fraction of randomly selected maps are connected to the mean field and appropriate values of the coupling strength are employed.\n2.5\nT\n\n2\n\nNTCB\n1.5\n\n\u01eb\n1\n\nCB\n\nS\n\n0.5\nNTCB\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\np\nFIG. 2: Boundaries on the parameter plane (p, \u01eb) separating\ndifferent collective states of the system.

This procedure may have practical applications in the control of spatiotemporal systems. These\nresults may be relevant in some biological and social contexts where the global information is often available only\nto a portion of agents in those systems.\nThis work was supported by CDCHT, Universidad de\nLos Andes, under grant No. C-1396-06-05-B and by\nFONACIT under grant No. F-2002000426, Venezuela.\n\n[4] H.
