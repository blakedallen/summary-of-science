We construct an efficient model for graphs of finitely generated subgroups of free\ngroups.

In addition, we answer a\nquestion of Culler and Shalen on ranks of intersections in free groups. The latter has also been\ndone independently by R. P. Kent IV.\n\n1. I NTRODUCTION\nOne purpose of this article is to investigate the interplay between the join and intersection of a\npair of finitely generated subgroups of a free group. Our main result, Theorem 2.4, is a minor\ngeneralization of the construction of the first author from [4], and produces a simple model for\nanalyzing intersections and joins. We use this technique to give a quick proof of a theorem\nof Dicks [2]. Another application of Theorem 2.4 is an answer to an unpublished question of\nCuller and Shalen [1]. This has been done independently by Kent [3]. Explicitly, the result is\nthe following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1. Let G = H1 \u2217M H2 be a graph of free groups such that each Hi has rank 2. If\nG \u0589 F3 then M is cyclic or trivial.\nOne can derive upper bounds on the rank of the intersection given lower bounds on the rank of\nthe join. This has also been observed in the nice article of Kent [3], where some upper bounds\nare explicitly computed. The proof of Theorem 1.1 presented here differs only slightly from\nhis. In the broadest terms, the two articles share with most papers in the subject an analysis\nof immersions of graphs, a method that dates back to Stallings [5]. Specifically, Kent uses\ndirectly the topological pushout of a pair of graphs along the core of their pullback, a graph\nwhich appears here as the underlying graph of a reduced graph of graphs.\nAcknowledgements. The authors are very grateful to Richard Kent for many discussions on\nthis topic, in particular those regarding Theorem 1.1.

Finally, many thanks to the referee for several useful comments and suggestions,\nespecially a much simplified proof of Lemma 2.2.\n2. G RAPHS\n\nOF GRAPHS\n\nA graph of graphs is a finite graph of spaces such that all vertex spaces are combinatorial\ngraphs and all edge maps are embeddings. Below are some simple operations on graphs of\ngraphs. All vertices and edges are indicated by lower case letters, and their associated spaces\nwill be denoted by the corresponding letter in upper case. We will not keep track of orientation\nhere despite its occasional importance-we trust the reader to sort out this simple matter when\nit arises. Let X be a graph of graphs with vertices vi and edges e j .\nBoth authors were supported in part by NSF postdoctoral fellowships.\n\n\fGraphs of subgroups of free groups\n\n2\n\n(M1) Making vertex and edge spaces connected: Let Vi,1 , . . . ,Vi,ni be the connected components of the vertex space Vi associated to the vertex vi of the underlying graph G, and\nE j,1 , . . . , E j,mi be the connected components of the edge space E j . We construct a new\ngraph of graphs as follows. First, we build the underlying graph. For each i and j, we\ntake a collection of vertices vi,k and edges e j,l , one for each connected component of\neach vertex space and edge space, respectively. We label vi,k with Vi,k and e j,l with E j,l ,\nand attach e j,l to vi,k if the image of E j,l in Vi is contained in Vi,k . The attaching maps\nfor this graph of graphs are the obvious ones. If e j,l is adjacent to vi,k , then we attach\nan end of E j,l \u00d7 I to Vi,k by the inclusion map.\n(M2) Removing unnecessary vertices: If V is a vertex space with exactly two incident edges\nsuch that both inclusions are isomorphisms, we remove v and regard the pair of incident\nedges as a single edge. If V has one incident edge and the inclusion is an isomorphism,\nwe remove V and the incident edge.\n(M3) Removing isolated edges: If a vertex space V has an edge e that is not the image of an\nedge from an incident edge space, we remove e from V .\n(M4) Collapsing free edges or vertices: We call an edge e of a vertex space V free if it is the\nimage of only one edge from the collection of incident edge spaces, say e\u2032 \u2282 E. In this\ncase, we remove e and e\u2032 from V and E. If a vertex space V is a point and has only one\nincident edge space, we remove v and the incident edge.\nA graph of graphs is reduced if any application of these operations leaves the space unchanged.\nNotice that any graph of graphs can be converted to a reduced graph of graphs by greedily\napplying (M1) through (M4). The remaining requisite operations on graphs of graphs are blow\nups and blow downs at a vertex.\n(M5) For a vertex space V , divide the incident edge spaces into two classes E1 , . . . , En and\nEn+1 , . . . , Em , and let V1 (V2 , resp.) be the union of the images of Ei , i \u2264 n (i > n, resp.).\nWhen V1 \u2229V2 is non-trivial, we replace V by V1 \u2294V2 and introduce a new edge v1 \u2229 v2\nwith the edge graph V1 \u2229V2 . Next, we attach Ei to V1 for i \u2264 n, Ei to V2 for i > n, and\nthe newly introduced edge space V1 \u2229V2 to V1 and V2 via the inclusion maps.\n(M6) Blow up: We blow up a vertex by applying (M5). We pass to connected components of\nthe newly created vertex and edge spaces via (M1). Finally, we pass to the associated\nreduced graph of graphs using (M2).\n(M7) Blow down: Let E be an edge space of a graph of graphs. If the two embeddings of\n/ then we remove the edge e of the\nE have disjoint images, that is, \u03b9 (E) \u2229 \u03c4 (E) = 0,\nunderlying graph and identify the two endpoints of e. Finally, the graph carried by the\nnew vertex is the one obtained by identifying the vertex space(s) at the ends of e by\nsetting \u03b9 ( f ) = \u03c4 ( f ), where f is either a vertex or an edge of E.\nRemark. Notice that if X has no free or isolated edges, then the space obtained by blowing\nup a vertex with an application of (M6) also has no free or isolated edges. Also, when V is\nconnected, it follows that V1 \u2229V2 is non-trivial and thus (M5) is applicable.\nThe horizontal subgraph of a graph of graphs is the graph obtained by restricting vertex and\nedge spaces to vertices. The mid-graph of a graph of graphs is the graph obtained by restricting\nvertex and edge spaces to midpoints of edges. These two subgraphs are denoted \u0393H and \u0393M ,\nrespectively. Note that neither of these graphs is necessarily connected. If X is reduced, then\n\u0393M and \u0393H do not have any valence one vertices. Conversely, if either one of them has a\nvalence one vertex, then there must be a free edge or vertex in X . If there are isolated edges,\nthen a component of \u0393M is a point. In particular, if X is reduced, then every component of \u0393M\nhas nontrivial fundamental group.\n\n\fGraphs of subgroups of free groups\n\n3\n\nLemma 2.1. Blowing up and blowing down are homotopy equivalences.\nThis follows easily upon observing that if two of the edges introduced during a blowup are\nboth adjacent to a vertex introduced during the blowup, then the images of the edge spaces\nthey carry are disjoint. That the remaining moves, other than (M3), preserve the homotopy\ntypes of X , \u0393H and \u0393M , is clear. Note that (M3) only serves to remove trivial components of\n\u0393M .\nIt is important to know when to blow up X . The following lemma achieves this.\nLemma 2.2. Let \u2206 be a connected graph with a collection C = {\u2206i }m\ni=1 of (not necessarily\ndistinct) connected subgraphs. If every edge of \u2206 is contained in at least two \u2206i and m > 3,\nthen after relabeling the \u2206 j , there is a partition C1 = {\u22061 , . . . , \u2206n } and C2 = {\u2206n+1 , . . . , \u2206m }\nof C such that at least two \u2206i in C1 intersect nontrivially and at least two \u2206i in C2 intersect\nnontrivially.\nProof. It suffices to find distinct A, B,C, D \u2208 C such that A \u2229 B 6= 0/ and C \u2229 D 6= 0.\n/ If all triple\nintersections are empty then C has at most two elements by connectivity of \u2206. Let A, B,C \u2208 C\nsuch that A \u2229 B \u2229 C 6= 0.\n/ Since \u2206 is connected, there is some D meeting, again without loss,\nC.\n\u0003\nRemark. Notice that if V is a vertex space of a reduced graph of graphs X with at least four\nincident edge spaces, then we can use Lemma 2.2 to ensure that (M5) is applicable.\nLet X be a reduced graph of graphs such that all vertex and edge spaces are connected. The\nspace X has an underlying graph that we shall denote by \u0393U (X ). Let m(X ) be the highest\nvalence of vertex of \u0393U (X ), n(x) the number of vertices with valence m(X ), and \u03c7 (\u0393U (X )) the\nEuler characteristic of \u0393U (X ). The complexity of X is the lexicographically ordered 3\u2013tuple\nc(X ) := (\u03c7 (\u0393U (X )), m(X ), n(X )).\nWe call a blowup of a vertex v using two sets of edge spaces satisfying Lemma 2.2 nontrivial.\nOur next lemma justifies this terminology.\nLemma 2.3. Let X be reduced and m(X ) > 3. If X \u2032 is obtained from X via a nontrivial application of (M6) to a vertex v with valence m(X ), then c(X \u2032 ) < c(X ).\nProof. Let {vi } be the vertices of X \u2032 introduced during a blow up of X at the vertex v. These\nvertices must have valence at least two, as otherwise X has a free edge and is not reduced. We\nassume contrary to the claim that c(X ) = c(X \u2032 ). If the Euler characteristics of the underlying\ngraphs of X and X \u2032 are equal, then the subgraph B spanned by the edges associated to the\nconnected components of V1 \u2229V2 must be a tree. First observe that it is connected as otherwise\nV could not have been connected. Second, if B is not a tree, then the Euler characteristic of the\nunderlying graph must decrease. As B is a tree we have\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n(1)\n1 \u2212 valence(v) = \u2211 1 \u2212 valence(vi ) .\n2\n2\ni\nIf both m(X \u2032 ) = m(X ) and n(X \u2032 ) = n(X ), then all but one of the vertices vi0 has valence two\nsince there are no valence one vertices making a positive contribution to the sum on the right\nhand side of (1). Therefore, every component of V1 (the alternative is handled identically) is the\nimage of exactly one incident edge space from one element of the partition of edges incident\nto v. However, this is impossible since the blowup X \u2032 was assumed to be nontrivial.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to state our main result.\n\n\fGraphs of subgroups of free groups\n\n4\n\nTheorem 2.4. Every graph of graphs X such that no connected component of \u0393M is a tree can\nbe converted to a reduced graph of graphs X \u2032 all of whose vertex groups have valence three.\nThere is a homotopy equivalence (X \u2032 , \u0393\u2032H , \u0393\u2032M ) \u2192 (X , \u0393H , \u0393M ).\nThe corank of a group G is the maximal rank of a free group that it maps onto and will be\ndenoted by cr(G). Before proving Theorem 2.4, a few remarks are in order. First, observe that\nif X is reduced, then the natural map \u03c01 (X ) \u2192 \u03c01 (\u0393U (X )) is surjective. Second, the complexity\nof all graphs of graphs homotopy equivalent to X is bounded below by (1 \u2212 cr(\u03c01 (X )), 3, 0).\nThat said, we now give a proof of Theorem 2.4.\nProof of Theorem 2.4. First we apply (M4) until there are no free edges. This does not change\nthe homotopy type of the triple (X , \u0393H , \u0393M ). There are no isolated edges since each component\nof \u0393M is assumed to have nontrivial fundamental group. Next, we pass to connected components of edge and vertex spaces and then pass to the associated reduced graph of graphs by removing valence two vertex spaces. Let X be a reduced graph of graphs, and consider a sequence\n{Xi } starting with X such that Xi is obtained from Xi\u22121 by nontrivially blowing up a maximal\nvalence vertex. Since all the Xi are homotopy equivalent and the maps \u03c01 (Xi ) \u2192 \u03c01 (\u0393U (Xi )),\ni > 0, are surjective, c(Xi ) \u2265 (1 \u2212 cr(\u03c01 (X )), 3, 0). According to Lemma 2.3, c(Xi ) > c(Xi+1 ).\nSince the complexity is bounded below, for some n, Xn has only valence three vertices.\n\u0003\nA graph of graphs represents a graph of free groups when the \u03b5 \u2013neighborhood of \u0393M is a\nproduct I \u00d7 \u0393M . In this case there are two natural immersions \u0393M \u2192 \u0393H in the sense of Stallings\n[5]. Moreover, there is an immersion \u0393H \u2192 \u0393U . We say such a graph of graphs is representing.\nConversely, suppose that G = \u2206(H1 , . . . , Hk , M1 , * * * , Ml ) is a graph of free groups with vertex\ngroups Hi , edge groups M j , and that there is a map \u03b3 : G \u2192 F which embeds each Hi . Let \u03b9 j\nand \u03c4 j be the two inclusion maps M j \u0592\u2192 H\u03b9 ( j) and M j \u0592\u2192 H\u03c4 ( j) . Represent F as the fundamental\ngroup of a marked labeled graph R with one vertex, and find immersions of marked labeled\ngraphs \u03b7i : \u0393Hi \u2192 R representing \u03b3 |Hi , and \u03bc j : \u0393M j \u2192 R representing \u03b3 |M j . We choose the\nnotation \u0393Hi in anticipation of the fact that they are the connected components of the horizontal\nsubgraph of the graph of graphs under construction.\nThe immersion \u03bc j factors through \u03b7\u03b9 ( j) and \u03b7\u03c4 ( j) via \u03b9 j : \u0393M j \u2192 \u0393H\u03b9 ( j) and \u03c4 j : \u0393M j \u2192 \u0393H\u03c4 ( j) . We\nconstruct a space X by taking the \u0393M j \u00d7 I as edge spaces, taking the \u0393Hi as vertex spaces, and\nusing as attaching maps \u03b9 j : \u0393M j \u00d7 {0} \u2192 \u0393H\u03b9 ( j) and \u03c4 j : \u0393M j \u00d7 {1} \u2192 \u0393H\u03c4 ( j) . Let \u03b1 j : \u0393M j \u00d7 I \u2192\n\u0393M j be the projection to the first factor. Since \u03b7\u03b9 ( j) \u25e6 \u03b9 j = \u03bc j and \u03b7\u03c4 ( j) \u25e6 \u03b9 j = \u03bc j there is a well\ndefined map \u03c0 : X \u2192 R which restricts to \u03b7i and agrees with \u03bc j \u25e6 \u03b1 j .\nWe now endow X with the structure of a graph of graphs. Let b be the base point of R. Let\nV = \u03c0 \u22121 (b) and El = \u03c0 \u22121 (ml ), where ml is the midpoint of an edge el of R. Each edge el of\nR induces two maps of El to V , each of which is an embedding. That these are embeddings\ncan be seen as follows. If one fails to be injective on vertices of El , then some \u0393Hi \u2192 R is\nnot an immersion. If it is injective on vertices but not on edges, then some \u0393M j \u2192 R is not\nimmersed. Thus, we may use this data to endow X with the structure of a graph of graphs. By\nTheorem 2.4, we can repeatedly blow up X until we produce a graph of graphs X \u2032 all of whose\nvertices have valence three. If (M3) is ever applied in the process, then it must be that some Mi\nwas trivial.\nRemark. Let w be a vertex of a vertex space V of a graph of graphs X . It follows that w is\na vertex of \u0393H and the valence of w in \u0393H is exactly the number of edge graphs incident to V\nwhose images contain w. If X is reduced and V has valence three, then there must be a vertex\nof V which is contained in the image of all three incident edge graphs. Moreover, if \u0393M has a\nvalence three vertex w, then the images of w in \u0393H must each have valence three in \u0393H .\n\n\fGraphs of subgroups of free groups\n\n5\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1. We begin by representing G \u0589 F3 by a map from a graph of graphs X\nto a bouquet of three circles R. Note that since G \u0589 F3 , at least one of the maps Hi \u2192 F3 is\ninjective. If the other fails to be injective, the result is immediate. Consequently, we are reduced\nto the case when both are injective and thus the construction above can be implemented. By\nblowing X up, we may assume that X has only valence three vertices. The map G \u0589 F3 factors\nthrough the map G \u223c\n= \u03c01 (X ) \u0589 \u03c01 (\u0393U ), and the rank of \u0393U must be either 3 or 4. If the latter\nholds, then M is trivial and the theorem holds. If \u0393U has rank 3, since all vertices of \u0393U are\nvalence three, there must be exactly four. By the remark above, if \u0393M has a valence three vertex,\nthen the map from the set of valence three vertices of \u0393H to the set of valence three vertices\nof \u0393U cannot be injective. Since the two components of \u0393H each have fundamental group F2 ,\nthey have 2 valence three vertices apiece. However, this implies the contradiction that \u0393U has\nat most 3 valence three vertices. Thus, \u0393M has vertices of valence at most two and so has rank\nat most one, as claimed.\n\u0003\nRemark. By [4], M is contained in the subgroup generated by a basis element in at least one\nof H1 or H2 .\nOther inequalities of this type are easily obtained through an analysis of a reduced valence\nthree graph of graphs representing the intersection. In particular, special cases of the Hanna\nNeumann conjecture can be verified with this analysis. For explicit inequalities, we refer the\nreader to Kent [3] who has also derived them.\n3. I NTERSECTIONS\n\nOF SUBGROUPS OF FREE GROUPS\n\nLet H1 and H2 be subgroups of a fixed free group F. If G = \u2206(H1 , H2 ; M j ), a graph of free\ngroups with two vertex groups {Hi }, edge groups {M j }, with no monogons and a a map\n\u03c0 : G \u0589 F embedding each of the factors Hi , then the vertex spaces of a graph of graphs X\nrepresenting \u2206 are bipartite.\nA graph of graphs is simple-edged if no vertex space has a bigon. To relate reduced graphs of\ngraphs to intersections of free groups we need to understand what happens when a graph of\ngraphs X as above is not simple-edged. Let p and q be the midpoints of a pair of offending\nedges, \u0393 = \u0393U (X ) the underlying graph of X , and give the edges of \u0393 distinct oriented labels.\nThe labeling of \u0393 induces labelings of \u0393M and \u0393Hi . Let \u0393\u2032M be the labeled graph obtained\nby identifying p and q. By folding the labeled graph \u0393\u2032M (see for instance [5]), we obtain a\nlabeled graph \u0393K with fundamental group K = \u03c01 (\u0393K , p). Folding endows \u0393K with a pair of\nimmersions \u03bdi : \u0393K \u2192 \u0393Hi . In addition, there is an immersion \u03b7 j : \u0393M j \u2192 \u0393K and the edge map\n\u0393M j \u2192 \u0393Hi is just \u03bdi \u25e6 \u03b7 j .\nWe must consider two cases with regard to p and q after folding. Namely, the midpoints p and\nq are either in the same component of \u0393M or in distinct components of \u0393M . We address the\nlatter first and assume, without loss of generality, that \u0393M1 and \u0393M2 are the components of \u0393M\ncontaining p and q. Compute the fundamental groups of \u0393H1 and \u0393H2 with respect to the images\nof p (which coincide with the images of q). From this we see that \u03c0 (H1 ) \u2229 \u03c0 (H2 ) contains\n\u03c0 (M1 ) and \u03c0 (M2 ). If \u03c0 (M1 ) 6< \u03c0 (M2 ) and \u03c0 (M2 ) 6< \u03c0 (M1 ), then each inclusion \u03c0 (Mi ) \u0592\u2192\n\u03c0 (H1 ) \u2229 \u03c0 (H2 ) is proper and the image of the fundamental group of \u0393K , computed with respect\nto the image of p, is precisely hM1 , M2 i. If neither \u03b71 nor \u03b72 is an isomorphism of labeled\ngraphs, then K properly contains M1 and M2 . In the event we are in the first case, without loss\nof generality, we shall assume that p, q are contained in \u0393M1 . We identify the vertices p and q\nof \u0393M and then fold to obtain a labeled graph \u0393K . As before, the immersion \u0393M1 \u2192 \u0393Hi factors\n\n\fGraphs of subgroups of free groups\n\n6\n\nthrough the induced immersion \u0393K \u2192 \u0393Hi . In this case \u0393M \u2192 \u0393K cannot be an isomorphism of\ngraphs and H1 \u2229 H2 properly contains M1 .\nLet X be a reduced simple-edged graph of graphs with underlying graph \u0393 = \u0393U (X ). Let\nX(\u0393) be the collection of reduced simple-edged graphs of graphs with underlying graph \u0393. If\nX , X \u2032 \u2208 X(\u0393), then X \u2264 X \u2032 if there is a map of graphs of spaces X \u2192 X \u2032 such that all restrictions\nto vertex and edge spaces are embeddings. We can restrict to the subcollection XX (\u0393) such\nthat for each X \u2032 \u2208 XX (\u0393) there is a map X \u2192 X \u2032 and the map \u0393H (X ) \u2192 \u0393H (X \u2032 ) is a graph\nisomorphism. Clearly XX (\u0393) has a maximal element Y . To link reduced simple-edged graphs\nof graphs to the strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture, we only need to observe that since\nX is simple-edged, each component of \u0393M (X ) is an embedded subgraph of \u0393M (Y ) (i.e. the\nfundamental groups of components of \u0393M (X ) are free factors of the respective components of\n\u0393M (Y )).\nThe strengthened Hanna Neumann conjecture then implies that if G is as above and the associated graph of graphs is simple-edged, then\n\n\u03c7 (\u0393H1 )\u03c7 (\u0393H2 ) + \u03c7 (\u0393M ) \u2265 0\nThe equivalence of the amalgamated graph conjecture and the strengthened Hanna Neumann\nconjecture of [2] follows immediately from the observation that the vertex and edge spaces\nof a representing simple-edged graph of graphs can be written as in the statement of Dicks'\ntheorem. We leave the details of the construction of this correspondence to the reader, though\nwe state a version of the equivalence for completeness.\nLet X be a simple-edged reduced graph of graphs all of whose vertices are valence three that\nrepresents a homomorphism \u2206(H1 , H2 , M j ) \u2192 F. Let vi be the vertices of \u0393U (X ), and for each\ni, let \u2206i be the intersection of the images of the three edge spaces incident to vi . Finally, let \u2206\nbe the disjoint union of the \u2206i , \u03a31 = \u2206 \u2229 \u0393H1 and \u03a32 = \u2206 \u2229 \u0393H2 , and \u03bc be the number of edges\nin \u2206.\nTheorem 3.1.\n\n1\n1\n\u03c7 (H1 )\u03c7 (H2 ) + \u2211 \u03c7 (Mi ) = |\u03a31 | \u0307|\u03a32 | \u2212 \u03bc\n4\n2\ni\n\nThe proof is straightforward. The number of valence three vertices of \u0393Hi is |\u03a3i |, \u0393Hi has only\nvalence two or valence three vertices, and the Euler characteristic of Hi is therefore \u2212 12 |\u03a3i |. The\nEuler characteristic of each \u0393M j is computed in the same manner. \u03bc is the number of valence\nthree vertices of \u0393M . In this formulation, the amalgamated graph conjecture simply states that\nif one is given a reduced simple-edged representing graph of graphs whose horizontal graph\nhas two components, then the right hand side of the above equality is nonnegative.\nR EFERENCES\n[1] M.
