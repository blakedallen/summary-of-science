Although the linear polarisation observed in AGN is accepted as evidence\nof synchrotron emission, the physical significance - hence the correct interpretation - of\nthe CP in AGN is not clear. This is largely because, until now, the observations were of\ninsufficient quality to constrain the properties of the CP.\nNew data from the VLBA and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) have\nenabled a reassessment of the origin of CP. The high angular resolution of the VLBA gives\nit a decisive advantage over most telescopes in circular polarimetry. Since the magnitude of\nthe CP is usually small and occurs primarily in compact regions, high resolution is necessary\nto mitigate the effects of beam depolarisation. The VLBA has also been able to, for the first\ntime, determine the location of a circularly polarised region in an AGN relative to its core\nand jets.\nParadoxically, the ATCA, with its modest angular resolution, has made equally important contributions to our understanding of CP. Its advantage is the demonstrated ability to\nmeasure the degree of CP in sources to better than 0.01%. It is particularly useful when\nthe angular resolution of the instrument is irrelevant because there is some other means of\nobtaining high angular resolution information about the source, usually from source variability. Its ability to do high precision, short timescale monitoring of intraday variable (IDV)\nradio sources, coupled with an understanding of interstellar scintillation, allows it to achieve\nmicroarcsecond resolution polarimetry.\nWe outline in Section 2 the various possible origins of the CP and in Section 3 the\nconstraints placed upon these mechanisms by the observations. Various other sources that\nexhibit CP are discussed in Section 4. The conclusions are presented in Section 5.\n\u2217\n\nPresent address: Kapetyn Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen, The Netherlands\n\n1\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nOrigins of Circular Polarisation\nSynchrotron Emission\n\nThere is a small degree of CP associated with synchrotron emission. For an electron with\nLorentz factor \u03b3 gyrating around a field line at an angle \u03b8 to the line of sight the degree of\nCP observed is (Legg & Westfold 1968)\nmc =\n\ncot \u03b8\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bd\n3\u03bdH\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u2248 cot \u03b8/\u03b3\n\n(1)\n\nin an optically thin source, where \u03bdH = eB sin \u03b8/me is the electron gyrofrequency. The degree\nof CP for an optically thick source remains similar; it is modified by a term of order unity\ndependent on the distribution of relativistic electrons, N (\u01eb) \u221d \u01eb\u22122\u03b1\u22121 (Melrose 1971). In a\nhomogeneous source the sense of the CP is expected to reverse as the source becomes optically\nthick.\nEquation (1) implies that high CP is associated with emission from particles with low\nLorentz factors, \u03b3, or emission nearly parallel to the magnetic field (i.e. small \u03b8). However,\nin both instances the power expected from synchrotron radiation is small. The brightness\ntemperature of particles radiating with Lorentz factor \u03b3 is limited by self-absorption to TB <\n\u223c\n(\u03b3 \u2212 1)me c2 /k \u2248 0.6 \u00d7 1010 (\u03b3 \u2212 1) K. However, bulk relativistic motion of the emitting region\ntoward the observer can Doppler boost the radiation, permitting higher degrees of CP for a\ngiven observed brightness temperature.\nThe emission intensity in synchrotron radiation is proportional to (sin \u03b8)\u03b1+1 . This falls to\nzero for emission nearly parallel to the magnetic field lines (i.e. as \u03b8 \u2192 0). Although a high\ndegree of CP is expected from radiation parallel to the magnetic field, it is associated with low\npower emission. Furthermore, regions with small \u03b8 would be confined to a small volume of\nthe source in any plausible model for the distribution of the magnetic field. The importance\nof magnetic field non-uniformity is implied by the fact that the degree of linear polarisation\nobserved in AGN is at least an order of magnitude lower than the \u223c 70% expected due\nto synchrotron radiation. This suggests that the level of CP expected due to synchrotron\nradiation is at least an order of magnitude lower than that expected from equation (1).\nThe low levels of CP expected from this emission mechanism and the fact that its mc \u221d\n\u03bd \u22121/2 dependence is generally not observed (see references in Saikia & Salter 1998) suggest\nthat synchrotron emission is not responsible for most of the CP observed in extragalactic\nsources at centimetre wavelengths.\n\n2.2\n\nCyclotron Emission\n\nCyclotron emission refers to radiation from non-relativistic electrons (i.e. \u03b3 \u2212 1 \u226a 1). If the\nelectron orbit is edge-on to the line of sight then 100% linearly polarised radiation is observed\nand, if face-on, the radiation is fully circularly polarised. Elliptically polarised radiation is\nobserved for intermediate orientations.\nCyclotron emission occurs at frequencies that are integer multiples of the cyclotron frequency, \u03bdH . The power of the emission at the harmonics of the cyclotron frequency is proportional to sin \u03b8, and thus falls to zero as \u03b8 \u2192 0. The radiative power in these harmonics\ntherefore falls to zero as the emission becomes more circularly polarised. The radiative power\nis non-zero for \u03b8 = 0 only for the emission at the fundamental frequency, and this is the only\nradiation which may be, in principle, fully circularly polarised.\n2\n\n\fThe brightness temperature of the emission in the rest frame of the emitting particles is\nlow: TB \u223c 0.6 \u00d7 1010 K. Unless the cyclotron emission is highly Doppler boosted any CP\nassociated with it is easily diluted by emission from brighter, synchrotron emitting regions.\n\n2.3\n\nCoherent Emission Mechanisms\n\nCoherent emission processes have the potential to account for CP in AGN. The polarisation\nof pulsar radiation suggests that this is plausible. Pulsar radiation must be due to coherent\nemission, since the brightness temperature of the radiation is in the range TB \u2248 1022 \u22121026 K.\nThe emission is also observed to be highly polarised (e.g. Manchester, Taylor, & Huguenin\n1975), however it is possible that the CP in pulsars is not intrinsic to the radiation mechanism\nat all, but instead arises due to propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere.\nIt is difficult to make specific comments about the polarisation properties of any coherent\nemission that may occur in AGN since (i) there is no preferred mechanism for the coherent\nemission, (ii) the polarisation properties of most of the various mechanisms have not been\nconsidered in detail, and (iii) it is unknown whether the physical conditions necessary for the\ncoherent emission would also lead to depolarisation of the escaping radiation. This last point\nis relevant because any coherent emission observed in AGN is likely to emanate from many\nlocalised patches emitting simultaneously (e.g. Melrose 1991; Benford 1992), which would\nlead to averaging out of the polarisation properties of each individual patch. Nonetheless,\nsome specific mechanisms predict no CP (Windsor & Kellogg 1974; Benford 1984).\nCoherent mechanisms are not required to explain high brightness temperature emission\nin IDV sources (see Melrose, these proceedings), and they do not seem to be explicitly required to explain the few per cent levels of CP seen in these sources either. Furthermore,\nif these processes do operate in AGN it is not obvious that they would dominate incoherent\nsynchrotron emission or propagation induced polarisation effects.\n\n2.4\n\nFaraday Conversion in a Relativistic Plasma\n\nPropagation can convert CP from linear polarisation in a process analogous to Faraday rotation, called generalised Faraday rotation or Faraday repolarisation (Sazonov 1969; Pacholczyk\n1973; Jones & O'Dell 1977).\nThe transfer of polarised radiation in a birefringent plasma may be understood in terms\nof the Poincar\u00e9 sphere (Figure 1). A magnetised homogeneous plasma has two mutually\northogonal natural wave modes, with some difference in wavenumber between the two modes,\n\u2206k 6= 0. The wave modes of a given birefringent medium define a diagonal through the\norigin and opposite ends on the surface of the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. Propagation through the\nplasma induces a phase difference L\u2206k between the two orthogonally polarised wavefields\nwhich results in a rotation of the polarisation vector around the Poincar\u00e9 sphere at constant\nlatitude around the axis defined by the natural modes.\nIn a magnetised relativistic plasma the natural modes of the medium are elliptically polarised. Propagation of radiation through such a plasma converts linearly polarised radiation\ninto circularly polarised radiation as follows (Kennett & Melrose 1998):\nV (\u03bd) = U0 (\u03bd) sin(\u03bb3 RRM),\nRRM = 3 \u00d7 104\n\n\u0012\n\nL\n1 pc\n\n\u0013*\n\nEL\n\n(2)\n\u0012\n\nnr\n1 cm\u22123\n\n3\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nB\n1G\n\n\u00132\n\n+\n\nsin2 \u03b8 rad m\u22123 ,\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere the relativistic rotation measure, RRM, depends upon the density of relativistic particles, nr , the path length, L, the magnetic field, B, and the minimum Lorentz factor of the\npairs, EL . This effect operates only when the direction of the incident linear polarisation is\nat an oblique angle to the projection of the magnetic field on the plane orthogonal to the\nray direction. The axes used to define the Stokes parameters may be chosen such that synchrotron emission has Q 6= 0, U = 0. With this choice, the effect occurs only if the incident\nradiation has U0 6= 0, requiring either Faraday rotation or that it originate from a region of\nthe source where the magnetic field is in a different direction to that in the region where the\npolarisation conversion takes place.\nA characteristic of this model is a strong frequency dependence on the sign of V . If RRM\nis high enough to produce appreciable amounts of CP at high frequency, this model predicts\nrapid changes in its handedness at low frequency. In a relativistic plasma, the position angle\nof the radiation defined by the U \u2212 V plane rotates \u221d \u03bb3 .\nHowever, the structure of the source can have important consequences for the frequency\ndependence of the CP. The Blandford-K\u00f6nigl jet is a particular and relevant instance of\nthis (Blandford & K\u00f6nigl 1979). Its largely self-similar structure can ensure that, at each\nfrequency, the CP is of constant sign and comparable magnitude. This is because the emission\nheight of the CP observed along the jet varies as a function of frequency.\nOne specific configuration for producing moderate (a few per cent) CP with consistent\nsign (see Begelman, these proceedings) involves a plasma with a weak uniform magnetic field\nand a highly spatially variable random magnetic field. The random component, with high\nrotativity per unit length, can generate moderate degrees of CP. Because this model relies\non a highly spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, one expects that the CP, as observed on\nthe plane of the sky, is also highly spatially inhomogeneous. The viability of this model can\nbe constrained from scintillation observations, as described in Section 3.\n\n2.5\n\nScintillation-induced Circular Polarisation\n\nAnother model that relies upon a highly inhomogeneous medium involves scintillation-induced\nCP (Macquart & Melrose 2000a,b). This is produced when even unpolarised radiation propagates through a region with non-uniform ne B (related to the Faraday rotation per unit\nlength). A transverse gradient in this quantity leads to different ray bending for the rightand left-hand circularly polarised radiation. Since the wavefronts are also rippled due to the\nphase delays caused by the inhomogeneity, as occurs in scintillation, transverse displacement\nof the two wavefronts can induce CP. The difference in bending angles between the two senses\nof polarisation is small but the radiation propagates over a large distance, so that the displacement between the two wavefronts, and hence the CP, can be appreciable. This theory\nmay provide an explanation for the variable CP observed at cm wavelengths in some AGN\nand in Sgr A*.\nThere is no preferred handedness for the sense of the CP produced by this mechanism:\nalthough the mean square CP is non-zero, the mean CP, averaged over a sufficiently long\ntime span, is zero. One expects sign changes in the CP on a timescale associated with the\nscintillation pattern. This is not observed. However, this model needs to be extended to\nremove some of the constraining assumptions on which it is based. The most notable of these\nis the assumption that the inhomogeneities occur on a thin screen. The relaxation of this\nassumption to take into account the extended nature of the medium would affect both the\nmagnitude of the effect and the timescale on which sign changes are predicted to occur.\n\n4\n\n\fV (right-hand)\n\n2\u03c7\n2\u03a8\n\nU\n\nQ\nV (left-hand)\n\nFigure 1: The Poincar\u00e9 sphere may be used to represent the polarisation state of radiation.\nElliptically polarised radiation is mapped from the Stokes parameters P/I = [Q, U, V ]/I to\nthe coordinates [cos(2\u03c7) cos(2\u03a8), cos(2\u03c7) sin(2\u03a8), sin(2\u03c7)]. The arrowed diagonal depicts a\ncase in which natural modes of a medium are elliptical. Generalised Faraday rotation in such\na medium corresponds to rotation of the polarisation vector at constant latitude about this\naxis.\n\n3\n\nObservational Properties\n\nIn this section we concentrate on the connection between the CP and its variability. Rayner\n(these proceedings) contains a further discussion on the origins of the CP in AGN.\nThe CP in AGN was known to be variable almost twenty years ago (e.g. Weiler & de Pater\n1983; Komesaroff et al. 1984). In their monitoring of a sample of AGN at 5 GHz, Komesaroff\net al. (1984) observed several general features which have been borne out by more accurate\nmeasurements:\n\u2022 Changes in CP occur with only small accompanying changes in the total intensity.\nInterpreting these in terms of an intrinsic change in the source due to, say, the emergence\nof a new component, the authors argued this implied degrees of CP typically \u223c 5% in\nthe polarised subcomponents of these sources. (These arguments also apply if the\nvariability is due to scintillation.)\n\u2022 The timescale of variability in CP is shorter than that of the linear polarisation, which\nin turn is shorter than that in the total intensity.\n\u2022 The magnitude of the fractional variability in the CP usually exceeds that in the linear\npolarisation, which exceeds that in the total intensity.\nComparison with recent ATCA and VLBA observations shows that many sources retain\nthe same handedness of CP over decade-long time scales. However, early measurements\nindicated that some sources do change sign: Komesaroff et al. (1984) noted sources 2 out of\n14 on the \u223c 100 day timescale that the observations were sensitive to. The reality of these\nsign changes has not been pursued with recent observations.\n5\n\n\fThe CP appears to occur in compact regions. VLBI observations by Homan & Wardle\n(1999) and Homan, Attridge, & Wardle (2001) support the general conclusion that the CP\nis associated with the compact regions near the cores of AGN.\nIt is not clear why some sources exhibit high degrees of CP. There appears to be no\nconnection between the degree of CP and the linear polarisation (Rayner, Norris, & Sault\n2000). VLBI suggests this may be due to Faraday depolarisation of the linearly polarised\nradiation (e.g. Homan et al. 2001). There is, however, a tentative connection between high\nCP and IDV AGN. Many of these sources exhibit strong and variable CP; these sources\ninclude PKS 1519\u2212273 (Macquart et al. 2000), PKS 0404\u2212385 and PKS 1144\u2212379. In each\ncase the degree of CP implied by comparing the changes in Stokes V and I is a few per cent1 .\nThe last two sources exhibit CP variability on shorter timescales than that observed in the\ntotal intensity, suggesting that it emanates from an even more compact region that does the\nemission responsible for the bulk of the unpolarised variability.\nAre the degrees of CP inferred in IDV sources atypical? The possibility that many other\nsources have high CP in regions so compact that they appear beam depolarised even on VLBI\nscales remains to be investigated.\n\n3.1\n\nThe Significance of CP Variability\n\nThe prevalence of CP variability in AGN suggests that it occurs predominantly in compact\nregions. One might expect that it should vary more rapidly than I because it can also change\nsign. However, this is unlikely to be the correct explanation for the short timescale. Both\nStokes Q and U can also change sign in the same manner as the CP, but they are not,\nin general, observed to vary as quickly. The rarity of sign reversals in the CP also argues\nagainst this, especially when compared to the large position angle changes observed in linear\npolarisation in the same sources.\nThe fact that the simultaneous total flux density and polarised flux density variations in\nIDV sources are different is often used as evidence against the viability of scintillation in these\nsources. While scintillation affects all four Stokes parameters of the propagating radiation\nidentically2 , the structure of the scintillating source complicates the issue.\nA simple source model comprised of two compact (scintillating) components illustrates\nthis. Suppose one component is faint but highly (say 10%) circularly polarised, while the other\nis strong but unpolarised. If the angular separation between the sources is comparable to the\nangular scale of the scintillations (\u223c \u03b8F = rF /D for weak scintillations) then the fluctuations\ndue to each of the components are uncorrelated. Furthermore, because the fluctuations in\nCP come from one component while the majority of the unpolarised flux density variations\noriginate from the other, the fluctuations in Stokes V and I show only a small correlation.\nThe nature of the correlation may change during the course of a year if the direction\nof the scintillation velocity changes. Such changes are possible because changes in Earth's\nvelocity, due to its orbit about the Sun, can substantially alter the apparent scintillation\nvelocity. If the two source components lie in a line parallel to the scintillation velocity one\nobserves identical fluctuations in both components, but with a delay corresponding to the\nangular separation of the components relative to the scale of the scintillation pattern. If the\nvelocity is orthogonal, one sees a loss of correlation, with a large decorrelation if the angular\n1\n\nThe mean degree of CP in these three sources ranges from \u2248 0.2 \u2212 0.8%.\nThis is strictly only true if the medium is unmagnetised, but it holds to a good approximation for scintillations in our Galaxy's ISM.\n2\n\n6\n\n\fseparation of the components is greater than the relevant scintillation decorrelation length\ndivided by distance to screen (i.e. \u03b8F in the weak scattering regime).\nHowever, real sources are more complicated than two blobs. VLBI polarimetric imaging\n(e.g. Gabuzda, Pushkarev, & Cawthorne 2000) shows a great richness of detail and structure\nin the linear polarisation of milliarcsecond components in AGN. If IDV sources exhibit the\nsame richness of structure on microarcsecond scales that they do on VLBI scales it would be\nsurprising that the polarisation lightcurves of IDV sources bear any resemblance at all to the\nfluctuations in total intensity! Indeed, many IDV sources show rich structure in polarisation\nlightcurves relative to the total intensity.\nThis suggests that attempts to model source variability in terms of a finite number of\ndistinct components are missing the point. One instead ought to be talking about measuring\nthe power spectrum of the brightness distribution in each of the four Stokes parameters.\nIt is possible to invert for the source structure in a rigorous manner if the variability is\ndue to scintillation. Formally, the power spectrum of the observed fluctuations is the product\nof the scintillation power spectrum due to a point source, which is known or can be determined, and the power spectrum of the source angular brightness distribution; see Macquart\n& Jauncey (2001 submitted) for more detail, and Figure 2 for an intuitive explanation of\nthe effect of source structure on its lightcurve. This technique would be useful in testing the\nmodel advanced by Begelman for which one expects small-scale structure in the CP.\n\n4\n\nLessons from Other Sources\n\nSgr A*\nCP has been detected in Sgr A* from 1.4 to 8.6 GHz with ATCA and the VLA (Bower,\nFalcke, & Backer 2000; Sault & Macquart 1999). The mean degree of CP is 0.3% but the\nCP varies on a timescale of \u223c 10 days, much faster than the monthly to yearly variability\nobserved in the total flux density at these frequencies. The origin of the variability is not\nwell constrained; it could be intrinsic or due to scintillation of a compact component in the\nsource.\nThe spectrum of the mean degree of CP is flat from 1.4 to 8.6 GHz but the significance\nof this is complicated by the fact that one does not know the degree of CP in the polarised\ncomponent. It appears that only a small portion of the source is polarised. Changes in the\nCP are accompanied by only small changes in the total intensity. If the variability in the CP\nis indeed associated with the variability of a specific component of the source, the 1.4 and\n2.4 GHz ATCA data suggest the presence of a subcomponent with an intrinsic CP of a few\npercent.\nGalactic microquasars\nCP is observed in several Galactic microquasars. CP was first detected in SS433 by Fender\net al. (2000) but the data were insufficient to determine the origin of the CP. While the\ntotal intensity emission and linearly polarised emission were unresolved, the CP was not. It\nwas suggested that the CP originated in the inner parts of the system and that the actual\npolarisation of these regions was as high as 10%.\nCP has recently been discovered in GRO 1655\u221240 from ATCA archival data of the August\n1994 outburst (J.-P. Macquart et al., in preparation). The time evolution of the CP was\nobserved at frequencies from 1.4 to 9 GHz, and shows the CP changing sign during the early\nstages of the outburst, reaching a maximum and decaying over a period comparable to the\ndecay of the total emission.\n7\n\n\fintensity\n\n(i)\nTotal Intensity\n\nI0+I1\nI0\n\nV1\n\n1\n\nV1, I1\n\n0\n\n0\n\ntime\n\nintensity\n\nI0\n\n(ii)\n\nCircular Polarization\n1\n\nTotal Intensity\n\nCircular Polarization\n1\n\nI0+I1\nV1\n1\n\nV1, I1\nI0\n\n(iii)\nP1\nP2\n\nPolarization 2\n\npolarized intensity\n\nPolarization 1\n\nt0\n\nt0\n\nFigure 2: Typical lightcurves for common source configurations: (i) a polarised sub-source\nembedded in a source too large to scintillate, (ii) two scintillating sources, with the smaller\ncomponent embedded in the larger, and (iii) two distinct polarised components.\n\n8\n\n\f5\n\nConclusions\n\nThe advent of high precision circular polarimetry has enabled a reassessment of the CP in\nAGN. However, most of the outstanding questions twenty years ago regarding the origin of\nthe CP in AGN still remain.\nVLBI and variability (scintillation) measurements indicate the CP in AGN is associated\nwith the emission near their cores, and that it occurs in very compact regions. Future\nmeasurements of the CP will therefore only be useful if the observations are capable of\nresolving this polarised emission.\nThe best means of obtaining this resolution at the centimetre wavelengths at which the\nCP is currently being detected is via scintillation 'imaging'. ATCA data indicate that a\nlarge proportion of IDV sources exhibit variable CP. Scintillation data can be used to extract\ninformation about the degree of the CP and its location relative to the linearly polarised and\nunpolarised emission.\nHigh precision polarimetry over a larger range of frequencies would be useful in constraining the origin of the circularly polarised emission. However, its use may be limited.\nComplications due to source inhomogeneity and structure limit the degree to which one can\nuse the spectral slope of the CP to constrain its origin.\n\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to thank Don Melrose, Dave Rayner, and Bob Sault for their advice and help.\n\nReferences\nBenford, G. 1984, ApJ, 282, 154\nBenford, G. 1992, ApJ, 391, L59\nBlandford, R.D., & K\u00f6nigl, A. 1979, ApJ, 232, 34\nBower, G.C., Falcke, H., & Backer, D.C. 1999, ApJ, 523, L29\nFender, R., Rayner, D., Norris, R., Sault, R.J., & Pooley, G. 2000, ApJ, 530, L29\nGabuzda, D.C., Pushkarev, A.B., & Cawthorne, A.W. 2000, MNRAS, 319, 1109\nHoman, D.C., & Wardle, J.F.C. 1999, AJ, 118, 1942\nHoman, D.C., Attridge, J.M., & Wardle, J.F.C. 2001, ApJ, 556, 113\nJones, T.W., & O'Dell, S.L. 1977, ApJ, 215, 236\nKennett, M.P., & Melrose, D.B. 1998, PASA, 15, 211\nKomesaroff, M.M., Roberts, J.A., Milne, D.K., Rayner, P.T., & Cooke, D.J. 1984, MNRAS,\n208, 409\nLegg, M.P.C. & Westfold, K.C. 1968, ApJ, 154, 99\nMacquart, J.-P., & Melrose, D.B. 2000a, Phys.
