INTRODUCTION\nThis work is devoted to the introduction of the concepts \"curvature\" and\n\"torsion\" with respect to the linear transports along paths considered in [1].\nThe former concept turns out to be more general in a sense that it can be\nintroduced in arbitrary vector bundles, while the latter one can be defined only\nin the tangent bundle to a differentiable manifold.\nThe theory of linear transports along paths will not be repeated here, the\nreader being referred to [1] for further details. We shall only mention briefly\n1 Permanent\n\naddress: Laboratory of Mathematical Modeling in Physics, Institute for Nuclear Research and Nuclear Energy, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Boul.

A path in B is a map \u03b3 : J \u2192 B, J being a real\ninterval (of arbitrary type).\nTo any C 1 linear transport (L-transport) along paths L in (E, \u03c0, B) is associated a derivation D along paths which maps \u03b3 into a derivation D\u03b3 along \u03b3\nsuch that its action on any C 1 section \u03c3 over \u03b3(J) is (s and s + \u01eb belong to J)\n\u00021 \u03b3\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0003\nD\u03b3 \u03c3 (\u03b3(s)) := Ds\u03b3 \u03c3 := lim\nLs+\u01eb\u2192s \u03c3(\u03b3(s + \u01eb)) \u2212 \u03c3(\u03b3(s)) ,\n\u03b5\u21920 \u03b5\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere L\u03b3s\u2192t , s, t \u2208 J is the L-transport along \u03b3 from s to t.\nIf {ei }(the Latin indices run from 1 to dim(\u03c0 \u22121 (x)), x \u2208 B) is a field of bases\nalong \u03b3, i.e. {ei (s)} is a basis in \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b3(s)), and \u03c3 = \u03c3 i ei (a summation from\n1 to dim(\u03c0 \u22121 (x)), x \u2208 B over repeated on different levels indices is assumed),\nthen the explicit form of (1.1) is\nh d\u03c3 i (\u03b3(s))\ni\n\u0001\nD\u03b3 \u03c3 (\u03b3(s)) =\n+ \u0393i.j (s; \u03b3)\u03c3 j (\u03b3(s)) ei (s)\nds\n\n(1.2)\n\nin which \u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) are the coefficients of L(coinciding with that of D). The\ngeneral form of \u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) is given by\n\u0393\u03b3 (s) = [\u0393i.j (s; \u03b3)] = F \u22121 (s; \u03b3)\n\ndF (s; \u03b3)\nds\n\n\u0010\n\n=\n\n\u2202H(s, t; \u03b3)\n\u2202t\n\nt=s\n\n\u0011\n,\n\n(1.3)\n\nF (s; \u03b3) being nondegenerate C 1 matrix function of s(defining also the general\nform of the matrix H(s, t; \u03b3) of L; cf.[1]). If along \u03b3 is made the change\n\u2032\n{ei (s)} \u2192 {ei\u2032 (s) = Aii\u2032 (s)ei (s)} of the basis {ei }, where [Aii\u2032 (s)] =: [Aii (s)]\u22121\nis a nondegenerate matrix function, then in the new basis {ei\u2032 } the coefficients\nof L are\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0393i..j \u2032 (s; \u03b3) = Aii (s)Ajj \u2032 (s)\u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) + Aii (s)\n\ndAij \u2032 (s)\n.\nds\n\n(1.4)\n\nIf B is a manifold and \u03b3 : J \u2192 B is a C 1 path with a tangent vector field, then\nof special interest are the L-transports along C 1 paths whose coefficients have\nthe form\ndim(B)\nX\ni\n\u0393.j (s; \u03b3) =\n\u0393i.j\u03b1 (\u03b3(s))\u03b3\u0307 \u03b1 (s)\n(1.5)\n\u03b1=1\n\nfor some functions \u0393i.j\u03b1 : B \u2192 R. In particular, if (E, \u03c0, B) is the tangent bundle\nto B, then \u0393i.j\u03b1 are coefficients of a linear connection, the corresponding to which\nparallel transport coincides with the considered L-transport along (smooth)\npaths.\nThe usage of the operator D\u03b3 , associated to a given L-transport along paths\nthrough (1.1), gives a possibility for defining the torsion and the curvature of\n2\n\n\fthat transport to which is aimed this paper. The torsion is introduced in Sect.\n2, where it is prove that it vanishes only for parallel transports generated by\nsymmetric linear connections. The curvature is defined in Sect. 3, where also\nsome its properties are investigate. Certain concluding remarks are made in\nSect. 4.\n2. TORSION\nLet M be a differentiable manifold and (T (M ), \u03c0, M ) be its tangent bundle\n(some times denoted simply by T (M ))[2].\nLet \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 M, J and J \u2032 being real intervals, be a C 2 map. With \u03b7(*, t)\nand \u03b7(s, *), s, t \u2208 J we denote the paths \u03b7(*, t) : s \u2192\u2192 \u03b7(s, t) and \u03b7(s, *) : t \u2192\n\u03b7(s, t) and with \u03b7 \u2032 (*, t)\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (s, *), respectively, the tangent to them vector fields.\nDefinition 2.1. The torsion operator of an L-transport along paths in\n(T (M ), \u03c0, M ) is the map T : \u03b7 \u2192 T \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 T (M ) defined for all (s, t) \u2208\nJ \u00d7 J \u2032 by\n\u03b7(s,*) \u2032\n\nT \u03b7 (s, t) := Ds\u03b7(*,t) \u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (*, t) \u2212 Dt\n\n\u03b7 (s, *) \u2208 T\u03b7(s,t) (M ),\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere D is the derivation along paths corresponding in accordance with (1.1)\nto the given L-transport along paths.\nLet in (T (M ), \u03c0, M ) be fixed some local coordinate basis. For the sake of\nsimplicity we assume \u03b7(J, J \u2032 ) to lie in only one coordinate neighborhood of the\ngenerating this basis coordinates. Then, using (1.2), we get the components of\nT \u03b7 (s, t) to be\n!\n\u0010\u2202 \u2202\n\u03b7\ni\ni\n(T (s, t)) =\n+ \u0393i.j (s; \u03b7(*, t))(\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (s, t))j \u2212\n\u03b7\n\u2202s \u2202t\n(s,t)\n\u0010\u2202 \u2202\n\u2212\n\u03b7i\n\u2202t \u2202s\n\n!\n\n(s,t)\n\n+ \u0393i.j (t; \u03b7(s, *))(\u03b7 \u2032 (s, t))j ,\n\nwhere \u0393i.j (. . .) are the coefficients of the considered L-transport. As we supposed\n\u03b7 to be aC 2 map, from here we find\nT \u03b7 (s, t)i = \u0393i.j (s; \u03b7(*, t))(\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (s, t))j \u2212 \u0393i.j (t; \u03b7(s, *))(\u03b7 \u2032 (s, t))j .\n\n(2.2)\n\nProposition 2.1. If an L-transport in (T (M ), \u03c0, M ) is a parallel transport\ngenerated by a linear connection \u2207 with local coefficients \u0393i.jk , then in every\ncoordinate basis\n\u0001i\n(2.3)\nT \u03b7 (s, t) = [\u0393i.jk (\u03b7(s, t)) \u2212 \u0393i.kj (\u03b7(s, t))](\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (s, t))j (\u03b7 \u2032 (s, t))k .\nProof. From what is supposed it follows that the coefficients of the Ltransport have the representation (1.5), i.e.\n\u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) = \u0393i.jk (\u03b3(s))\u03b3\u0307 k (s)\n3\n\n(2.4)\n\n\ffor every \u03b3. Substituting this equality into (2.2), we get (2.3).\nUnder the condition of the above proved proposition it naturally arises the\ntorsion tensor T of \u2207. In fact, if we take two C 2 vector fields A and B defined\non one and the same neighborhood U \u2282 M and for every x \u2208 U define \u03b7x\nby \u03b7x (s0 , t0 ) = x, \u03b7x\u2032 (s, t0 ) = A\u03b7x (s,t0 ) and \u03b7x\u2032\u2032 (s0 , t) = B\u03b7x (s0 ,t) for a fixed\n(s0 , t0 ) \u2208 J \u00d7 J \u2032 , then, we can put\n(T (A, B))(x) := T \u03b7x (s0 , t0 ).\n\n(2.5a)\n\nSo, from (2.3), we obtain\n[T (A, B))(x)]i = [\u2212\u0393i.jk (x) + \u0393i.kj (x)]Aj (x)B k (x),\n\n(2.5b)\n\nhence T (A, B) = \u2207A B \u2212 \u2207B A \u2212 [A, B], [A, B] being the commutator of A and\nB[2], is the usual torsion tensor (cf.[2]).\nThe next proposition shows that the torsion operator, as in a case of parallel\ntransports generated by linear connections, characterizes the deviation in the\ngeneral case of arbitrary L-transports in the tangent bundle to a given manifold\nfrom the parallel transports generated by symmetric affine connections.\nProposition 2.2. The torsion operator of a given L-transport in (T (M ), \u03c0, M )\nis zero in a neighborhood of some point x \u2208 M , i.e.\nT \u03b7 (s, t) = 0\n\nf or every \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 M, \u03b7(s0 , t0 ) = x,\n\n(2.6)\n\nif and only if that transport is a parallel transport generated by symmetric linear\nconnection in that neighborhood.\nProof. The sufficiency is almost evident: if the given L-transport is a\nparallel transport generated by a symmetric linear connection, then T = 0(by\ndefinition of such connection) and it is valid (2.4) as a consequence of which\nfrom (2.5a) follows (2.6).\nConversely, let (2.6) be true. Then from (2.2), we get\n\u0393i.j (s; \u03b7(*, t))(\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (s, t))j = \u0393i.l (t; \u03b7(s, *))(\u03b7 \u2032 (s, t))\nfrom which follows\n\u0393i.j (r; \u03b3) = \u0393i.jl (r; \u03b3)\u03b3\u0307 l (r),\nwhere \u0393i.jl (r; \u03b3) are some functions, \u03b3 = \u03b7(*, t), \u03b7(s, *), respectively r = s, t and\nis the tangent to \u03b3 vector field.\nTherefore, we see that \u0393i.jk (s; \u03b7(*, t)) = \u0393i.kj (t; \u03b7(s, *)). So, as a consequence\nof the arbitrariness of \u03b7, the common value of the right and left hand sides of\nthis equality can depend only on the point \u03b7(s, t). Denoting this common value\nby \u0393i.kj (\u03b7(s, t)) we obtain \u0393i.kl (\u03b7(s, t)) = \u0393i.lk (\u03b7(s, t)) and\n\u0393i.k (r; \u03b3) = \u0393i.kl (\u03b3(r))\u03b3\u0307 l (r),\n\nr \u2208 J, \u03b3 = \u03b7(*, t), \u03b7(s, *),\n\nresp. r = s, t.\n\nAs \u03b7 is arbitrary, from here we find\n\u0393i.k (r; \u03b3) = \u0393i.kl (\u03b3(r))\u03b3\u0307 l (r),\n4\n\n\u0393i.kl = \u0393i.lk\n\n(2.7)\n\n\ffor every path \u03b3 : J \u2192 M and r \u2208J. Due to (2.5b) and proposition 5.1 of [1]\n(see also the comments after its proof) this means that \u0393i.kl are coefficients of a\nsymmetric linear connection the generated by which parallel transport coincides\nwith the initial L-transport (see also proposition 5.4 from [3] and the note after\nits proof).\n3. CURVATURE\nThe curvature operator, which is referred to an arbitrary vector bundle\n(E, \u03c0, B) is defined analogously to the torsion operator.\nLet \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192B.\nDefinition 3.1. The curvature operator of an L-transport along paths in\nthe vector bundle (E, \u03c0, b) is a map R : \u03b7 \u2192 R\u03b7 , R\u03b7 : (s, t) \u2192 R\u03b7 (s, t) where\nR\u03b7 (s, t) maps C 2 sections of (E, \u03c0, b) into sections of (E, \u03c0, b) and it is defined\nfor every (s, t) \u2208 J \u00d7 J \u2032 by\nR\u03b7 (s, t) := D\u03b7(*,t) \u25e6 D\u03b7(s,*) \u2212 D\u03b7(s,*) \u25e6 D\u03b7(*,t) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nIf A is a C 2 section of (E, \u03c0, B) and {ei } is a field of bases in \u03b7(J, J \u2032 ), i.e.\n{ei (s, t)} is a basis in \u03c0 \u22121 (\u03b7(s, t)), then, by means of (1.2), we get\n[(R\u03b7 (s, t))(A)](\u03b7(s, t)) = R\u03b7 (s, t)i.j Aj (\u03b7(s, t))ei (s, t),\nwhere\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2202 i\n\u2202 i\n\u0393.j (t; \u03b7(s, *)) \u2212\n\u0393.j (s; \u03b7(*, t)) +\n\u2202s\n\u2202t\ni\nk\ni\n+\u0393.k (s; \u03b7(*, t))\u0393.j (t; \u03b7(s, *)) \u2212 \u0393.k (t; \u03b7(s, *))\u0393k.j (s; \u03b7(*, t))\n(3.3)\nR\u03b7 (s, t)i.j =\n\nare the components of R with respect to {ei } at the point (\u03b7, s, t).\nProposition 3.1. If B is a manifold, \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 B is of class C 2 and the\ncoefficients of some L-transport have the form (1.5), then the components of its\ncurvature operator in any basis are\nR\u03b7 (s, t)i.j = R(\u03b7(s, t))i.j\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03b7 \u2032 (s, t))\u03b1 (\u03b7 \u2032\u2032 (s, t))\u03b2 ,\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere\ni\nh \u2202\n\u2202\nR(\u03b7(s, t))i.j\u03b1\u03b2 = \u2212 \u03b2 (\u0393i.j\u03b1 ) + \u03b1 (\u0393i.j\u03b2 ) \u2212 \u0393k.j\u03b1 \u0393i.k\u03b2 + \u0393k.j\u03b2 \u0393i.k\u03b1\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\n\u03b7(s,t)\n\n.(3.5)\n\nProof. This proof reduces to a simple substitution of (1.5) into (3.3).\nIf an L-transport is a parallel transport in (T (M ), \u03c0, M ) generated by a\nlinear connection \u2207 with coefficients \u0393i.jk , then, as a consequence of the last\nproposition, naturally arises the curvature tensor R of \u2207[2]. Actually, let us\ndefine A, B and \u03b7x as it was done before (2.5a) and put\n(R(A, B)C)(x) := [(R\u03b7x (s0 , to ))C](x)\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor arbitrary vector field C. From here, (3.4) and (3.5), we find R(A, B) =\n\u2207A \u2207B \u2212 \u2207B \u2207A \u2212 \u2207[A,B] and that the components of R at x \u2208 M are exactly\n(R(x))i.jkl as they are given by (3.5)(cf . e.g. [2]).\n5\n\n\fProposition 3.2. Let in some basis {ei\u2032 } the coefficients of an L-transport\nin a vector bundle (E, \u03c0, B) be zeros along every path, i.e.\n\u2032\n\n\u0393i..j \u2032 (s; \u03b3) = 0\n\nf or every \u03b3 : J \u2192 B.\n\n(3.7)\n\nThen:\n1) If B is a manifold and \u03b3 is aC 1 path, then in every basis {ei } is valid (1.5),\ni.e.\n\u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) = \u0393i.j\u03b1 (\u03b3(s))\u03b3\u0307 \u03b1 (s), \u03b3 : J \u2192 B,\n(3.8)\nfor some functions \u0393i.j\u03b1 : B \u2192 R. Besides, in the basis {ei\u2032 } is fulfilled the\nequality\n\u2032\n\u0393i..j \u2032 \u03b1 (x) = 0, x \u2208 B;\n(3.9)\n2) The curvature of the considered L-transport is zero, i.e.\nR\u03b7 (s, t) = 0\n\nf or every \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 B,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich, if B is a manifold, is equivalent to\nR(x)i.j\u03b1\u03b2 = 0,\n\nx \u2208 B.\n\n(3.10\u2032 )\n\u2032\n\nProof. Let us choose a basis {ei } in E such that ei (x) == Aii (x)ei\u2032 (x), x \u2208\n\u2032\n\u2032\nB, det[Aii ] 6= 0, \u221e and [Aii\u2032 ] := [Aii ]\u22121 .\nd\nFrom (3.7) and (1.4) follows 0 = \u0393i.j (s; \u03b3)Ajj \u2032 (\u03b3(s)) + ds\nAjj \u2032 (\u03b3(s)) or\n\u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) = \u2212\n\n\u0011 \u2032\n\u0010 \u2202A i\u2032 \u2032 \u0011\n\u0010d\nj\nAij \u2032 (\u03b3(s)) )Ajj (\u03b3(s)) =\nAj (x)\nds\n\u2202s j\n\nx=\u03b3(s)\n\n\u03b3\u0307 \u03b1 (s)\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere {x\u03b1 } are local coordinates in a neighborhood of \u03b3(s).

If the curvature operator of an L-transport in a vector\nbundle (E, \u03c0, B) is zero, i.e.\nR\u03b7 (s, t) = 0 f or every \u03b7 : J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 B, s, t \u2208 J,\n\n(3.13)\n\nthen in E there exist fields of bases {ei\u2032 } in which the coefficients of the Ltransport are zeros along every path, i.e. (3.7) is valid. Besides, all of these\nfield of bases are obtained from one another by linear transformations with\nconstant coefficients.\n6\n\n\fProof. Let us choose a field of bases {ei } in E. We have to prove the\nexistence of a transformation {ei (x)} \u2192 {ei\u2032 (x) = Aii\u2032 (x)ei (x), det[Aii\u2032 (x)] 6=\n0, \u221e}, such that in the basis {ei\u2032 } to be fulfilled (3.7).\n\u2032\nIf we let [Aii (x)] := [Aii\u2032 (x)]\u22121 , then, due to (1.4), it follows that (3.7) is\nequivalent to\n\u2032\nd i\u2032\nAi ((\u03b3(s)) = Ail (\u03b3(s))\u0393l.i (s; \u03b3)\nds\n\nf or every \u03b3 : J \u2192 B.\n\n(3.14)\n\n\u2032\n\nNow we shall prove the existence of Aii (x) satisfying this equality which will\nmean also the existence of the pointed transformation.\nLet V := J \u00d7 * \u00d7 J(n = dim(B) times) and \u03b7 : V \u2192B. For every y =\ny\n(y1 , . . . , yn ) \u2208 V we define maps \u03b7iy : J \u2192 B and \u03b7ij\n: J \u00d7 J \u2032 \u2192 B, such that\ny\ny\n\u03b7i (s) := \u03b7(y)|yi =s and \u03b7ij (s, t) := \u03b7(y)|yi =s,yj =t (for i = j we must have s = t\ny\nhere). Evidently \u03b7iy does not depend on yi and \u03b7ij\nis independent of yi and yj .\n\u2032\nNow we shall prove the existence of Aii (x) satisfying\n\u2032\n\u2202 i\u2032\nAi (\u03b7(y)) = Ail (\u03b7(y))\u0393l.i (yj ; \u03b7jy ),\nj\n\u2202y\n\n(3.15)\n\nwhich is obtained from (3.14) for s = yj and \u03b3 = \u03b7j , as a consequence of which\n\u03b7j (yj ) = \u03b7(y).\nIn fact, a simple calculation shows that\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\u2202 \u0010 i\u2032\n\u2202 2 \u0011 i\u2032\n\u22022\ny\nl\nA\n(\u03b7(y))\n=\nA\n(\u03b7(y))\u0393\n(y\n;\n\u03b7\n)\n\u2212\n\u2212\nk\ni\nl\n.i\nk\n\u2202y j \u2202y k\n\u2202y k \u2202y j\n\u2202y j\n\u2212\n\n\u0011\n\u0001m\ny\n\u2032\n\u2202 \u0010 i\u2032\ny\nl\nA\n(\u03b7(y))\u0393\n(y\n;\n\u03b7\n)\n= Aim (\u03b7(y)) R\u03b7jk (yj , yk ) .i ,\nj\nl\n.i\nj\nk\n\u2202y\n\nfrom which, due to (3.13), follows the expression between the first and the\nsecond equality signs to be equal to zero. But these are exactly the integrability\nconditions for (3.15). Hence, the system (3.15) has a solution with respect to\n\u2032\nAii .(All such solutions are obtained from one of them by a left multiplication\nwith a constant matrix, but this is insignificant here.)\nIt is important to be noted that by its construction this solution depends\nonly on the point \u03b7(y) but not on the map \u03b7 itself. Consequently, if we take a\npath \u03b3 : J \u2192 B and put y j = s, \u03b7j = \u03b3 and \u03b7(y) = \u03b3(s) in (3.15) (the remaining\narbitrariness in \u03b7 is insignificant), we get (3.14). So, in the basis {ei\u2032 } defined by\n\u2032\nei (x) = Aii (x)ei\u2032 (x) is valid (3.7), i.e. in {ei\u2032 } the coefficients of the considered\nL-transport are zeros.\nAt the end, if in two arbitrary bases {ei } and {ei\u2032 = Aii\u2032 ei } holds \u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) =\ni\u2032\n\u0393..j \u2032 (s; \u03b3) = 0 for every path \u03b3, then from (1.4) follows dAii\u2032 (\u03b3(s))/ds = 0, so\n\u2032\nwe get Aii (x) =const.\nTheorem 3.1. If in a vector bundle is given an L-transport along paths,\nthen a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a field of bases\nin the bundle, in which the coefficients of the L-transport are zeros along any\n7\n\n\fpath, or, equivalently, in which the transport's matrix is unit along any path,\nis the curvature operator of this L-transport to be zero.\nProof. This result is a direct consequence of propositions 3.3 and 3.2, as\nwell as proposition 5.2 from [1].\nProposition 3.4. If an L-transport in the tangent bundle to a manifold\nhas a zero curvature, then a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence\nof a holonomic basis in which the coefficients of the L-transport are equal to\nzero is it to be torsion free, or, equivalently, when this L-transport is a parallel\ntransport generated by a symmetric linear connection.\nProof. First of all, the second part of the proposition is a corollary from\nproposition 2.2.\nIf the conditions of this proposition are fulfilled, then by proposition 3.2 in\nthe pointed holonomic basis are valid (3.7) \u2212 (3.9), the last of which, together\nwith (2.3), gives T \u03b7 (s, t) = 0.\nOn the opposite, if T \u03b7 (s, t) = 0, then from the conditions of the proposition,\n(2.5a), (3.6), theorem 3.1 and proposition 3.2 follows that the considered Ltransport is a parallel transport generated by a linear connection with vanishing\ncurvature and torsion. Hence the coefficients \u0393i.jk of this connection and \u0393i.j of the\nL-transport are connected through the relation \u0393i.j (s; \u03b3) = \u0393i.jk (\u03b3(s))\u03b3\u0307 k (s), but,\nas is known (see e.g. [4]), for the first quantities there exists a holonomic basis\nin which they vanish. In fact, if in {\u2202/\u2202xi } the connection's coefficients are \u0393i.jk ,\n\u2032\n\nthen there exists Aij = Aij \u2032 , such that \u0393i.jk = Aij \u2032 \u2202Ajj /\u2202xk , as the integrability\n\u2032\ni\nconditions for these equations with respect to Aij are exactly R.jkl\n= 0. The\ni\ni\ni\nbasis ej \u2032 = Aj \u2032 \u2202/\u2202x is holonomic because the conditions for this are T.jk\n== 0.\n\u2032\ni\nAnd at the end, as a consequence of (1.5), we have \u0393..j \u2032 k\u2032 = 0.\n\u2032\n\n4. CONCLUSION\nIn this work we have introduced the curvature and torsion of a linear transport along paths in, respectively, a vector bundle and the tangent bundle to\na manifold. This was done by means of the assigned to the transport derivation along paths. Evidently, the same scheme works also with respect to any\nderivation along paths (we did not used explicitly the transports anywhere).\nThis fact is in a natural agreement with the proved in [1] equivalence between\nL-transports along paths and derivations along paths. On the other hand, as\nthe derivation along paths is a local concept such must be, and in fact are,\nthe curvature and torsion of a linear transport along paths. From this point of\nview arises the problem for the global analogs of these concepts, which will be\nconsidered elsewhere.\nAt the end, we want to note that the investigated in [5] \"flat\" linear transports in tensor bundles are \"flat\" in the sense that their curvature operators, as\nthey are defined in the present paper, are zero. This follows from the simple fact\nthat the derivations along paths corresponding to these transports are covariant\ndifferentiations along paths generated by linear connections (see [5], Sect. 3 and\n\n8\n\n\fSect. 3 of the present work).\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe author expresses his gratitude to Prof. Vl.
