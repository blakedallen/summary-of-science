The self\u2013duality of the field strength is shown to arise\nas a consequence of the supergravity solution.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe space/time noncommutativity that arises on D-branes in the presence of a near critical\n'electric' Neveu-Schwarz potential has produced some interesting surprises. In particular\non a D3 brane after taking a certain limit, one is left with a new noncommutative open\nstring theory (NCOS) that is decoupled from closed strings [1,2]. One natural question is to\n\n\u2217 d.berman@phys.rug.nl\n\u2020 p.sundell@phys.rug.nl\n\n1\n\n\fdetermine the M\u2013theory origin of these NCOS. The five\u2013brane plays the role of the D-brane\nand the open membrane plays the role of the string. The background three form C then\nplays the role of the NS two form. This has motivated the investigation of the five\u2013brane\ntheory in the background of a non trivial C field [3,4]. A decoupling limit for the five\u2013brane\nthat is the M\u2013theory origin of the NCOS limit was given in [5,6]. This theory has near\ncritical field strength and is believed to be associated with an open membrane theory in six\ndimensions.\nPreviously, the dual supergravity descriptions of different brane theories have been investigated in several contexts, for a review see [7]. In particular the soliton that interpolates\nbetween two different SUSY vacua has been interpreted as providing a description of the\nthe flow between the corresponding decoupled brane theories [8]. This has recently been\ndiscussed for the NCOS in [5,9]. In this paper we will examine some aspects of the supergravity dual of the five\u2013brane theory. In particular we identify the solution to eleven\ndimensional supergravity that is dual to the five\u2013brane theory at critical field strength and\nalso describes the flow from the conformal (2,0) theory to the noncommutative five brane\n(OM) theory. This solution has been analysed previously in [10\u201314]. We will also describe\nthe appropriate critical decoupling limit for the noncommutative five\u2013brane (OM) theory\nfrom the supergravity point of view as an asymptotic flow.\nThere is one important consideration that need to be adressed when determing the limits\nthat one may take on the five\u2013brane. The adapted field strength H = db + f5\u2217 C must obey\nthe following nonlinear self\u2013duality constraint [16],\n\u221a\n\n\u2212 det g\n1 + K \u22121 \u03bb\n\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3\u03bb\u03c4 H\u03c3\u03bb\u03c4 =\n(G )\u03bc H\u03bd\u03c1\u03bb ,\n6\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g is the determinant of the induced spacetime metric g\u03bc\u03bd , \u01eb012345 = 1, the scalar K\nand the tensor G\u03bc\u03bd are given by\nK=\n\ns\n\n1+\n\nl6p 2\nH ,\n24\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\n\fG\u03bc\u03bd\n\n1+K\n=\n2K\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n\nl6 2\n+ p H\u03bc\u03bd\n4\n\n!\n\n(3)\n\n.\n\nThis presents a small puzzle; why should the bulk supergravity three form potential obey\nsuch a self\u2013duality constraint? Here we will analyse the five\u2013brane supergravity solution\ndescribed in [12] and demonstrate how this solution leads to the non\u2013linear self\u2013duality of C\npulled back to the five\u2013brane and also how one may describe the critical field limit, crucial\nto the NCOS construction, from the point of view of the five\u2013brane SUGRA solution.\nWe will also examine the five\u2013brane directly in six dimensions from the open membrane\npoint of view. A solution to the open membrane equations of motion in the background of\nnear critical field strength is presented that is the natural lift of the string solution given in\n[2]. The properties of this solution are in accordance with the physical picture of the critical\nfield limit where the tension of the membrane cancels the force excerted due to the charged\nmembrane boundary. This solution describes how the membrane becomes absorbed into\nthe five\u2013brane worldvolume which is also in agreement with the dual supergravity solution.\nRelated ideas concerning the noncommutaive five\u2013brane (OM) theory and NCOS can be\nfound in [17].\n\nII. THE SUPERGRAVITY DESCRIPTION\n\nA five\u2013brane solution of eleven\u2013dimensional supergravity with a finite deformation of the\nspacetime three\u2013form potential was found in [10\u201312]. Here we will use the notation of [12].\n(\u03bc = 0, 1, .., 5; p = 6, .., 9, 11):\nds2 = (\u22062 \u2212 \u03bd 2 )\n\n\u2212 16\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2206+\u03bd\n\uf8ed\n\u2206\u2212\u03bd\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 21\n\nHpqrs = l\u22123\np \u01ebpqrst \u2202t \u2206 ,\n\n\u2206\u2212\u03bd\ndx2\u2212 +\n\u2206+\u03bd\n\u0012\n\n\u2206=k+\n\n\u0013 12\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n\ndx2+ \uf8f8 + (\u22062 \u2212 \u03bd 2 ) 3 dy 2 ,\n\nR3\n,\nr3\n\ni j k\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1p = l\u22123\np e\u03bc e\u03bd e\u03c1 Fijk \u2202p \u2206\n\n1\n\nR \u2261 N 3 lp ,\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere k and R are integration constants and Fijk (i = 0, 1, ..., 5) is the following three\u2013form;\n3\n\n\f2 \u2212 21\n\n2\n\nFijk = (\u2206 \u2212 \u03bd )\n\n(\u03b4il +\n\n1\nq l )hljk\n2\u03bd i\n1\n\n2(\u2206 + \u03bd) 2\n\n1\nhijk = \u01ebijklmn hlmn ,\n6\n\n+\n\nqij = hikl hj kl ,\n\n(\u03b4il \u2212\n\n1\nq l )hljk\n2\u03bd i\n1\n\n2(\u2206 \u2212 \u03bd) 2\n\u03bd2 =\n\n!\n\n,\n\n1 ij\nq qij ,\n24\n\n(7)\n\n(8)\n\nThe spatial line element dx2+ and the Lorentzian line element dx2\u2212 are given by\n1\n1\ndx2\u00b1 = \u03b4\u03bci \u03b4\u03bdj (\u03b4ij \u00b1 qij )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd .\n2\n2\u03bd\n\n(9)\n\nThe geometry of the solution was analysed in [12]. To avoid naked singularities the parameter\n\u03bd must be restricted to 0 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 k. There are three distinct cases.\ni) \u03bd = 0 the solution is the usual five brane metric with AdS7 \u00d7 S 4 in the near horizon.\nii) 0 < \u03bd < k, this is a noncritical field strength deformation. The solution interpolates\nbetween the near horison AdS7 \u00d7 S 4 geometry of N coinciding five\u2013branes and flat\nspacetime at r = \u221e.\niii) \u03bd = k, this is the critical field strength deformation, it interpolates between AdS7 \u00d7 S 4\nand the geometry of an array of membranes stretched in the x\u2212 direction and 'smeared'\nin the x+ direction. The line element is given below in (10).\nThe precise justification for relating \u03bd to the field strength on the five\u2013brane is given below\nwhen we analyse the properties of C3 . It is the third case we wish to study. In the asymptotic\nregion, r \u2192 \u221e one recovers the 'smeared' membrane metric:\nr\nds =\nR\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u00132\n\ndx2\u2212 +\n\nR\n(dx2+ + dy 2 ) ,\nr\n\n(10)\n\nAs disussed in [12] the solution has 16 unbroken supersymmetries. As we flow to AdS,\nr \u2192 0 we have the usual 16 \u2192 32 symmetry restoration. This metric (10) had also been\ninvestigated in the context of seven dimensional domain wall supergravity with 16 unbroken\nsupersymmetries [18]. The fact it is the smeared membrane metric that appears in the world\nvolume of the five\u2013brane is consistent with the OM interpretation of the critical field limit\n[5], see the discussion below.\n4\n\n\fWe next determine the three form potential that is induced on the five\u2013brane worldvolume.\nThis essentially means that one must solve the field strength Hp\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 for the potential C\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 ,\nwhere\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1p = \u2212\u2202p C\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 + 3\u2202[\u03bc C\u03bd\u03c1]p .\n\n(11)\n\nFirst, making use of the algebraic properties of hijk we determine,\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n2\n2 \u22122 i j j\n2\n2 l\nl\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1p = l\u22123\np (\u2206 \u2212 \u03bd ) \u03b4\u03bc \u03b4\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1 (\u2206 + \u03bd )\u03b4i \u2212 \u2206qi hljk \u2202p \u2206 .\n\n(12)\n\nThen, fixing a gauge so that C\u03bc\u03bdp = 0 (which preserves the background symmetry) we may\nsolve for C\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 as follows\ni j k\nC\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = l\u22123\np \u03b4\u03bc \u03b4\u03bd \u03b4\u03c1\n\nIntroducing an\n\nSO(5,1)\nSO(3)\u00d7SO(2,1)\n\n(\u03b4il + 2\u03bd1 qi l ) (\u03b4il \u2212 2\u03bd1 qi l )\nhljk .\n+\n2(\u2206 + \u03bd)\n2(\u2206 \u2212 \u03bd)\n!\n\n(13)\n\nvalued sechsbein, {v\u03bc \u03b1 , u\u03bc a }, \u03b1 = 0, 1, 2, a = 3, 4, 5, of the\n\ninduced metric, g\u03bc\u03bd at r = \u221e as follows:\ng\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc X M \u2202\u03bd X N gM N |r=\u221e = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 v\u03bc \u03b1 v\u03bd \u03b2 + \u03b4ab u\u03bc a u\u03bd b ,\n\n(14)\n\nwe can write the pull\u2013back of C at infinity\n2\u03bd 1\n2\u03bd 1\n) 2 \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 v\u03bc\u03b1 v\u03bd\u03b2 v\u03c1\u03b3 + l\u22123\n) 2 \u01ebabc ua\u03bc ub\u03bd uc\u03c1\np (\nk+\u03bd\nk\u2212\u03bd\nh\n2\u03bd\n=q\n.\n\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 v\u03bc\u03b1 v\u03bd\u03b2 v\u03c1\u03b3 + h\u01ebabc ua\u03bc ub\u03bd uc\u03c1 ,\nh2 l6p =\nk\u2212\u03bd\n1 + h2 l6p\n\nC\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 |r=\u221e = l\u22123\np (\n\n(15)\n(16)\n\nThe purpose of this rewriting is that we can then identify the three-form (16) with the\nsolution to the five\u2013brane non\u2013linear self\u2013duality equation (1), described in [3]. Thus the\nvacuum at r = \u221e has a non\u2013trivial three\u2013form potential (16) in the five\u2013brane directions,\nand moreover it in fact obeys the five\u2013brane field equation (1). Hence we may identify\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 = C\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 |r=\u221e .\n\n(17)\n\nThe critical field strength limit described in [5,6] is when h2 l6p \u2192 \u221e. From (16) we see this\noccurs in the asymptotic region when \u03bd \u2192 k. Hence this justifies our identification of the\n5\n\n\f\u03bd = k case with the critical field strength limit. It is important notice that the non\u2013linear\nnature of the five\u2013brane self\u2013duality is crucial for the critical limit. (Linear self\u2013duality\nwould not allow a critical limit.)\nWe now wish to describe a decoupling limit, i.e. a limit whereby lp \u2192 0, which has an\nasymptotic region with five\u2013brane metric and field strength scaling as described in [5,6].\n2\nThe decoupling limit must obey the criteria that the line element l\u22122\np ds and the four\u2013form\n\nfield strength H are held fixed (such that the supergravity action is finite for this background;\nby making N large the curvature becomes small and the supergravity approximation makes\nsense).\nThus we are drawn to consider the following limit:\nl3n\n\u03bd = k = g3n ,\n2lp\n\nx\u0303\u00b1 =\n\n\u2212 n n \u22121\nlg 2 lp2 x\u00b1\n\nwhere x\u0303\u00b1 , r\u0303 and the length scale lg are fixed and\n\n1\n\n,\n\nr\u0303 =\n\nlng r\n1\n\nl1+n\nN3\np\n\n,\n\n(18)\n\nn > 0. After rewriting in terms of fixed\n\nvariables one has:\n1\n2\n1\n2\nds2\n= f 3 r\u0303 2 dx\u03032\u2212 + f \u2212 3 r\u0303 \u22121 dx\u03032+ + N 3 f 3 r\u0303 \u22121 (dr\u0303 2 + r\u0303 2 d\u03a92 ) ,\n2\nlp\n\n(19)\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\nH4 = N\u01eb4 (S 4 ) + d r\u0303 3 dx\u03033\u2212 + f \u22121 dx\u03033+ ,\n2\n\n(20)\n\nf = 1 + r\u0303 \u22123 .\n\n(21)\n\nThis does not describe a field theory limit in the asymptotic region. It would be wrong to\nexpect a field theory description of the noncommutive five\u2013brane, just as one does not have\na field theory description for the D3 brane with temporal noncommutativity. The five\u2013brane\nwith non-trivial C in a decoupling limit has also been considered in [14] and indeed the line\nelement (19) was found. This predated the discussion of the noncommutative five\u2013brane\n(OM) theory and the importance of the critical field limit.\n\n1 This\n\ncondition follows from considering the graviton absorption cross section [19]; this was\n\npointed out to us by M. Alishahiha.\n\n6\n\n\fFIGURES\n\nAdSxS\n\nSmeared M2\n\n(2,0)\n\nNCM5\n(OM)\n\nFIG. 1. The flow as controlled by r\u0303 to the (2,0) theory from the NC five\u2013brane (OM) theory is\ngiven by the interpolation between AdS7 \u00d7 S 4 and the smeared membrane metric.\n1\n\nOne may then check that scaling r\u0303 \u223c \u01eb\u2212 3 exactly reproduces the scaling taken for the\nnoncommutative five\u2013brane (OM) theory [5,6]:\n1\n\nlp \u2192 \u01eb 3 ,\n\nH\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2192 \u01eb\u22121 ,\n\nHabc \u2192 \u01eb0 ,\n\ng\u03b1\u03b2 \u2192 \u01eb0 ,\n\ngab \u2192 \u01eb1 .\n\n(22)\n\nOne important property of this limit is that the open membrane metric described in [6] is\nfixed in units of lp .\nIn summary, the solution (4)-(5) interpolates between a stack of five\u2013branes at r = 0 with\nzero field strength and a stack of five\u2013branes at r = \u221e with non\u2013vanishing field strength\nH\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 given by (17). The solution is fixed in the limit given by lp \u2192 0 and (18), which flows\nto a decoupled six\u2013dimensional noncommutative five\u2013brane (OM) theory.\nIt is worth remarking that such a limit is only possible at critical field strength. In the\nnon-critical case, 0 < \u03bd < k, one cannot obtain a brane decoupled from the bulk theory.\nThis is consistent with how the NCOS limit requires critical field strength to decouple the\nbulk modes.\n\nIII. CRITICAL OPEN MEMBRANE SOLUTION\n\nWe may interpret the source of the constant field strength at r = \u221e as an array of self\u2013dual\nstrings stretched along the boundary of the space in the x\u2212 direction and smeared homogeneously in the x+ \u2013directions. These self\u2013dual strings are boundaries of open membranes. In\nthe critical limit, given by \u03bd = 1, the open membranes become dissolved into the five\u2013brane.\n7\n\n\fThis is exactly analogous to how open strings behave in D\u20133 brane with the critical field\nstrength [1,2].\nWe will now illustrate this by analysing the solutions of the membrane field equations in the\nbackground provided by a five\u2013brane with critical field strength.\nThe membrane is described by the following equations of motion, constraints and boundary\nconditions [20].\n\u1e8c \u03bc +\n\n1\n{X \u03bd , {X \u03bc , X\u03bd }} = 0 ,\nl2p\n\n\u1e8a 2 = \u2212\n\n(23)\n\n1\n{X \u03bc , X \u03bd }{X\u03bc , X\u03bd } ,\n2l2p\n\n\u1e8a \u03bc \u2202i X\u03bc = 0 ,\n\ni = \u03c1, \u03c3 ,\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\n1q\n\u2212 det \u03b3n\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 X\u03bc + \u01eb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 H\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 n\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 X \u03bd \u2202\u03b3 X \u03c1 = 0 ,\nl2p\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u1e8a \u03bc and \u2202i X \u03bc denote differentiation with respect to the worldvolume time \u03c4 and\nspatial coordinates \u03c1, \u03c3, respectively,\n{A, B} = \u01ebij \u2202i A\u2202j B ,\n\n(27)\n\nand the determinant of the worldvolume metric is given by\nq\n\n\u2212 det \u03b3 =\n\n1\n{X \u03bc , X \u03bd }{X\u03bc , X\u03bd } .\n4\n2lp\n\n(28)\n\nIn what follows we shall choose the normal derivative at the boundary to be given by\nn\u03b1 \u2202\u03b1 = \u2202\u03c1 .\nIn order to find a solution we make an ansatz where the open membrane is infinitely stretched\nin the X 2 direction as follows\nX 0 = X 0 (\u03c4, \u03c1) ,\n\nX 1 = X 1 (\u03c4, \u03c1) ,\n\nX \u03bc = constant ,\n\nX 2 = lp \u03c3 ,\n\n\u03bc = 3, ..., 9, 11 .\n8\n\n(29)\n\n(30)\n\n\fThis results in the equations:\n\u1e8c \u03bc \u2212 X \u2032\u2032\u03bc = 0 ,\n\n(31)\n\n(\u1e8a 0 )2 + (X \u20320 )2 = (\u1e8a 1 )2 + (X \u20321 )2 ,\n\n(32)\n\n\u1e8a 0 X \u20320 = \u1e8a 1 X \u20321 ,\n\nX\n\n\u2032\u03bc\n\n\u03bc\n\n= H \u1e8a ,\n\n(33)\n\nH\u2261\n\nhl3p\nq\n\n1 + h2 l6p\n\n(34)\n\n.\n\nThese equations are equivalent to the equations of an open string in an electric field H =\n\u03b1\u2032 F 0 1 = \u03b1\u2032 g 00 F01 .\nIn case 0 \u2264 H < 1 the general solution is given by\nX 0 = \u00b1X 1 = alg (\u03c4 \u00b1 H\u03c1) ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere lg is a fixed length and a a real constant. In the case H = 1, however, there are new\ncritical solutions appearing. The solution for H = 1 is given by\nX 0 = lg (a\u03c4 + b\u03c1) ,\n\nX 1 = lg (b\u03c4 + a\u03c1) .\n\n(36)\n\nThus we have a static, non-degenerate open membrane solution given by\nX 0 = lg \u03c4,\n\nX 1 = lg \u03c1 ,\n\nX \u03bc = constant ,\n\nX 2 = lg \u03c3 ,\n\n(37)\n\n\u03bc = 3, ..., 9, 11 .\n\nNotice that in the limit lp \u2192 0 we have carried out a reparametrisation of \u03c3 \u2192\n\n(38)\nlg\n\u03c3.\nlp\n\nClearly\n\nthis does not affect the geometry of the solution.\nThe length scale lg for this solution is the scale introduced in [5,6]. This is the effective\ntension of the open membrane inside the five\u2013brane and is related to the five\u2013brane field\n1\n\nstrength by lg = (h2 l9p ) 3 .\n\n9\n\n\fThus the solution describes a membrane stretched out inside the five\u2013brane in the 0, 1, 2\ndirections. This is what one expects from the dissolved membrane interpretation of the\nfive\u2013brane supergravity solution given by (10).\nPhysically, one sees that the membrane tension (which is scaled to \u221e) is cancelled by\nthe scaling of the electric field so that the membrane retains a finite length scale. This is\nreminiscent of the zero force condition experienced by BPS solutions. It would be interesting\nto see whether the cancellation properties persist (as they do for BPS solutions) beyond the\nclassical level.\nAn obvious application would be to investigate the thermal properties of the noncommutative\n(OM) theory by analysing the non extremal version of the smeared membrane metric (10).\n\nIV.
