Most of applicable and interesting characteristics of graphene has been investigated intensely\nexperimentally1\u20136 . Because of interesting phenomena\nwhich graphene showed, the artificial material has been\nreceived robust attentions from theoretical and experimental physics communities7\u201310 . Induction of superconductive correlations into graphene layer by proximity of\nsuperconducting electrodes observed experimentally by\nHeersche et al.11 . Also inducing the ferromagnetism into\ngraphene layers by means of proximity effects observed\nexperimentally by Tombros et al.12 . In this regard,\ntheoretical scientists utilized Dirac-Bogoliubov-de Genne\n(Dirac-BdG) for investigating and predicting interesting\nphenomena because of the proximity effects7,9,13\u201316 .\nInterplay between ferromagnetic graphene sheets\nand conventional superconductor is generalized\ntheoretically15 . Also Linder et al.17 generalized the\ntheoretical investigations from conventional to unconventional superconductors in similarity with metallic\ncases which has been studied intensely18\u201320 . Most of\nthe previous works are devoted to study electronic transport properties of the graphene-based junctions such\nas; Josephson currents8,21 , electronic conductance9,24 ,\nspintronic conductance22,23 , shot noise10,26 and etc.,\nbut poor attentions has been focused on the heat\ntransport properties and electronic thermal conductance\nof the junctions. The BTK formalism is generalized\nby Bardas and Averin27 for obtaining electronic thermal conductance in the clean limit. Also, Devyatov\n\na) Current\n\naddress: Department of Physics, Sharif University of\nTechnology, Tehran 11155-9161, Iran.\nb) Current address: Department of Physics, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway.\n\net al.28,29 studied electronic thermal conductance of\nNormal metal|I|d junctions in the ballistic regime.\nFor high-sensitive devices including graphene-based\njunctions, knowing all electronic and thermal properties of the junctions are crucial and important points\nfrom application point of view. Few previous works\ndevoted for investigating of electronic thermal transport\ncharacteristics of the graphene-based junctions30,31 .\nIn this paper we especially investigate signatures of\ndx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry on the electronic heat transport\ncharacteristics of the F|I|d junctions. We start with the\nDirac-BdG Hamiltonian and use obtained wave functions within the three regions and appropriate boundary conditions at interfaces for deriving the Andreev\nand Normal reflection coefficients in the thin barrier\napproximation24,25 . Using the mentioned coefficients we\npresent numerical investigations of electronic thermal\nconductance of the Ferromagnetic|Insulator|d/s-wave superconductor junctions in the ballistic limit. We find that\nfor F|I|d junctions the electronic thermal conductance, \u0393\nshows oscillatory behavior vs barrier strength. Increasing the orientation angle of the superconducting gap \u03b1\nup to values close to \u03c0/4 only enhances whole values of\nthe \u0393 and for maximum value of the superconducting\ngap orientation angle namely \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 magnitude of the\noscillations diminish highly. Another finding is that the\nelectronic thermal conductance shows an exponential increase vs temperature for small values of \u03b1. By increasing\nthe angle of superconducting gap orientation up to \u03c0/4\nthe mentioned exponential form modify to linear form\nand at \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 the thermal conductance shows precisely\nlinear increase with respect to temperature, namely \u0393 \u221d T\nthat the finding induces in mind the Wiedemann-Franz\nlaw32 from metals in the low temperatures. The paper is\norganized as follows:\nIn Sec. II we explain the analytical derivations of Andreev and Normal reflection coefficients by starting from\nthe Dirac-BdG Hamiltonian and in Sec. III the electronic\nthermal conductance of F|I|S is investigated by plotting\n\n\f2\nthe quantity with respect to strengthes of exchange field\nand barrier in the thin barrier approximation regime. In\nSec. IV we study the effects of dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry\non the electronic thermal conductance of the junctions\nwithin the thin barrier approximation. The paper go to\nend with conclusions in Sec. V.\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nWe study interplay between graphene-based ferromagnetic and superconductor junctions in the ballistic limit,\ntherefore we employ the Dirac-BdG Hamiltonian for obtaining suitable wave functions.

By applying the thin barrier approximation on the obtained reflection and transmission factors they reduce to simple factors that are available in\nthe Appendix A. For investigating the electronic thermal\nconductance of the junction one needs to calculate the\nprobabilities of Andreev and Normal reflections namely\n|rA,\u03c3\u0304 |2 and |rN,\u03c3 |2 .

We proceed to investigate the characteristics of electronic heat\ntransport \u0393 of the mentioned junctions and throughout\nthe paper we normalize energies with respect to \u22060 and\nwe set \u22060 = ~ = kB = 1 throughout our computations.\nIII. ELECTRONIC THERMAL CONDUCTANCE OF THE\nF|I|S JUNCTIONS IN THE THIN BARRIER\nAPPROXIMATION\n\nIn this section we study electronic thermal transport\ncharacteristics of the Ferromagnetic|Insulator|s-wave superconductor junctions in the ballistic and thin barrier\n\napproximation regime. In Fig. 2 we set T = 0.2Tc ,\nand plot normalized thermal conductance \u0393 vs normalized strength of barrier \u03a9/\u03c0 for three different values of\nmagnetization texture strength h/\u22060 , also in Fig. 3\n\u03a9 = 0 is set and the normalized conductance is plotted for three values of temperatures vs magnetization\ntexture strength h/\u22060 . Throughout our calculations we\nhave set EF = 10\u22060 and also used a large mismatch potential U0 . The normalized thermal conductance shows\nan oscillatory behavior vs \u03a9/\u03c0 which this finding can be\nunderstood by noting the fact that how the amplitude of\nAndreev and Normal reflections depend on \u03a9, (See Appendix A). In the thin barrier approximation, the width\nof normal layer L and barrier potential V0 set for small\nand large values, respectively. Andreev and Normal coefficients are involved cos 2\u03a9 and sin 2\u03a9 terms which are\nperiodic functions of \u03a9 and consequently the appeared\nperiodic oscillations in the thermal conductance are originated from the two appeared periodic functions in the\nAndreev and Normal coefficients. As it can be seen in\nFig. 1, since the configuration contains one semi-infinite\nsuperconductor the Andreev bound states don't contribution to the transport characteristics of the junction\nunder consideration7,8,24,25 . For small values of magnetic\nstrength, the amplitude of oscillations has been enhanced\nin comparison with larger values of h/\u22060 .\nBy increasing the magnetic strength, incident angle defined in Eq. (3) reduce and hence diminish the amplitude\nof oscillations which means suppression of available propagating channels in the system. The normalized thermal\nconductance of the F|I|S junction is plotted vs. h/\u22060 ,\nthe magnetization strength of Ferromagnetic region, in\nFig. 3 for three values of T = 0.2Tc , 0.5Tc , 0.7Tc and also\n\u03a9 = 0 is set for the three plots.

Increasing the\nexchange splitting suppress propagating Dirac Fermions\nmodes in the configuration under consideration up to values near h ' EF , for larger values of h the propagating\nchannels enhance , see Ref.s 14 and 15. In the light of\nabove discussion, the thermal conductance reach to its\nminimum value at h ' EF that depends on the temperature. The fact also can be inferred from Fig. 2 which the\ncurve of h = 12\u22060 has an intermediate value between the\ncurves of h = 2\u22060 and h = 7\u22060 . We proceed to investigate effects of d-wave symmetry on the heat conductance\nof F|I|d junctions in the clean limit.\n\nIV. ELECTRONIC THERMAL CONDUCTANCE OF THE\nF|I|D JUNCTIONS IN THE THIN BARRIER\nAPPROXIMATION\n\nNow we present main results of this paper namely\nthe fingerprints of dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconducting region\non the electronic heat transport characteristics of F|I|d\njunctions in the thin barrier regime whose interfaces are\nlocated at x = 0, L. As it is seen in Fig. 1, unlike\ns-wave superconductors, the role of crystal orientation\nof dx2 \u2212y2 -wave superconductors with respect to interface is very important. We assume a two-dimensional\nd-wave superconductor with cylindrical Fermi surface\nin the k-space is deposited on top of graphene sheet\nand connected to a sandwiched insulator region between Ferromagnetic and superconducting regions. The\npair potential for s-wave\nsuperconductor is isotropic\nq\np\ni.e. \u2206(T )=\u22060 tanh 1.76 Tc /T \u2212 1. On the other\nhand, the pair potential for dx2 \u2212y2 -wave symmetry is\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nT/T\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nc\n\nFIG. 4.\n(Color online) The normalized thermal conductance \u0393 of F|I|d graphene-based junctions vs temperature\nfor five values of d-wave superconducting gap orientation\n\u03b1 = 0, \u03c0/16, \u03c0/8, 3\u03c0/16, \u03c0/4.

In this case, superconducting gap is\nanisotropic i.e. \u2206\u00b1 (T, \u03b3)=\u2206d (T ) cos(2\u03b3 \u00b1 2\u03b1) in which\n\u03b1 is angle of a-axis with respect to normal trajectory\nto the interface (See Fig. 1) and \u03b3 is propagation angle of quasiparticles. The temperature dependency of\nd-wave superconductors is different from s-wave case33 .\nAs it mentioned above, for the thin barrier approximation is assumed that L \u001c 1 and V0 \u001d 1, so one can\nconsider \u03a9 as a constant and terms involving \u03a9 reduce\nto simpler ones. Here we have set EF = 10\u22060 and use\nlarge mismatch potential U0 . Fig. 4 indicates electronic\nheat conductance of the F|I|d junctions vs temperature\nfor five different values of crystal orientation of dx2 \u2212y2 wave superconductor \u03b1, the exchange field and strength\nof thin barrier are set at h = 2\u22060 and \u03a9 = 0, respectively. Electronic thermal conductance for \u03b1 = 0, \u03c0/16\nshows an exponential increase vs temperature and for\nlarger values of \u03b1, the exponential form is modified to\nlinear increase. The heat conductance shows completely\nlinear increase vs temperature at maximum value of superconductor crystal orientation angle \u03b1 = \u03c0/4 that induces in mind the Wiedemann-Franz law for metals in\nlow temperatures which thermal conductance is proportional to temperature, \u0393 \u221d T . The finding is arisen\nfrom orientational-dependent superconducting gap that\nincreasing \u03b1 decreases the propagating channels of superconducting correlations described by Andreev reflection\ncoefficients. Although the Dirac and Schrodinger equations are used in graphene-based and metallic junctions\nrespectively but the behaviors of thermal conductance\nin the graphene-based junctions are qualitatively similar\nto results of metallic N|I|d-wave junctions in which the\npropagating channels of moving quasi-particles is closed\n\n\f5\n2.5\n\u03b1=\u03c0\n\u03c0/4\n\n\u03b1=3.7\u03c0\n\u03c0/16\n\u03b1=\u03c0\n\u03c0/8\n\n\u03b1=3.3\u03c0\n\u03c0/16\n\n\u03b1=\u03c0\n\u03c0/16\n\n\u03b1=3\u03c0\n\u03c0/16\n\n\u03b1=0\n\nNormalized Thermal Conductance \u0393\n\n2.0\n1.9\n1.8\n\nNormalized Thermal Conductance \u0393\n\n\u03b1=\u03c0\n\u03c0/4\n\u03b1=3\u03c0\n\u03c0/16\n\u03b1=\u03c0\n\u03c0/8\n\u03b1=\u03c0\n\u03c0/16\n\u03b1=0\n\n2\n\n1.7\n1.6\n1.5\n1.4\n1.3\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0.2\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\n\u03a9/\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\nFIG. 5.

In this context d-wave symmetry\nshows the same effects on thermal conductance of both\ngraphene-based and metallic junctions. The behaviors\nof heat conductance vs strength of barrier are shown in\nFig. 5 for several values of \u03b1. Temperature and exchange\nfield have set in h = 2\u22060 and T = 0.2Tc . The thermal\nconductance vs strength of barrier region shows an oscillatory behavior and the increase of \u03b1 enhance whole\nvalues of heat conductance. The period of oscillations vs\nstrength of barrier suppresses completely for maximum\ncrystal orientation angle \u03b1 = \u03c0/4. In Fig. 6 the thermal\nconductance is plotted vs the strength of magnetization\nexchange field h/\u22060 for several values of \u03b1 and T = 0.2Tc .\nIn general, \u0393 for F|I|d junctions vs h/\u22060 behaves similar\nto F|I|S configuration . The behavior can be verified by\nnoting the mentioned reasons in the Sec. III for F|I|S\ncase.

We found that for F|I|S junctions,\nthe heat conductance vs magnetization strength h/\u22060\nshows a minimum at values near h ' EF that by\nincreasing temperature the minimum move towards\nsmaller values of h/\u22060 . The finding is qualitatively\nsimilar to F|I|d junctions but increasing superconductive\ngap orientation \u03b1 shifts whole values of \u0393 towards larger\nvalues and no change induces to the trend of \u0393 vs h/\u22060 .\nThe electronic thermal conductance vs barrier strength\noscillates and shows identical behavior for F|I|S and F|I|d\nconfigurations for all values of superconductor crystal\norientation \u03b1 except values near \u03b1 ' \u03c0/4.
