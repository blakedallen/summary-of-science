The spectrum of 80 ks of data from when the\nsource was bright, using the the lowest 10 ks as background, is well fitted over the 3\u201310 keV\nband with a simple power-law of photon index \u0393 = 2.11. The source spectrum can therefore\nbe decomposed into an approximately constant component, containing a strong iron emission\nline, and a variable power law component. Assuming that the power-law continuum extends\ndown to 0.5 keV enables us to deduce the absorption acting on the nucleus. A simple model\ninvolving Galactic absorption and 2 photoelectric edges (at 0.72 and 0.86 keV) is adequate\nfor the EPIC spectrum above 1 keV. It still gives a fair representation of the spectrum at lower\nenergies where absorption lines, UTAs etc are expected. Applying the absorption model to the\nlow flux spectrum enables us to characterize it as reflection-dominated with iron about 3 times\nSolar. Fitting this model, with an additional power-law continuum, to 32 \u00d7 10 ks spectra of\nthe whole observation reveals that \u0393 lies mostly between 2 and 2.3 and the normalization of\nthe reflection-dominated component varies by up to 25 per cent. The breadth of the iron line\nsuggests that most of the illumination originates from about 2 gravitational radii. Gravitational\nlight bending will be very strong there, causing the observed continuum to be a strong function\nof the source height and much of the continuum radiation to return to the disk. Together these\neffects can explain the otherwise puzzling disconnectedness of the continuum and reflection\ncomponents of MCG\u20136-30-15.\nKey words: galaxies: active \u2013 galaxies: Seyfert: general \u2013 galaxies: individual: MCG\u20136-3015 \u2013 X-ray: galaxies\n\n1 INTRODUCTION\nThe X-ray spectrum of the bright Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG\u20136-30-15\n(z = 0.00775) has a broad emission feature stretching from below 4 keV to about 7 keV. The shape of this feature, first clearly\nresolved with ASCA by Tanaka et al. (1995), is skewed and has\na peak at about 6.4 keV. This profile is consistent with that predicted from iron fluorescence from an accretion disc inclined at\n30 deg and extending down to within about 6 gravitational radii\n(6rg = 6GM/c2 ) of a black hole (Fabian et al. 1989; Laor 1991).\nIn part of the ASCA observation the line extended below 4 keV\n(Iwasawa et al. 1996) which means that the emission originates at\nradii less than 6rg , possibly due to the black hole spinning. XMMNewton has now observed MCG\u20136-30-15 twice (Wilms et al. 2001;\nFabian et al. 2002a) and in both cases the line extended down to\nabout 3 keV.\nThe X-ray continuum emission of MCG\u20136-30-15 is highly\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: acf@ast.cam.ac.uk\n\nvariable (see Vaughan, Fabian & Nandra 2002 for a recent analysis). If the observed continuum drives the iron fluorescence then\nthe line flux should respond to variations in the incident continuum on timescales comparable to the light-crossing, or hydrodynamical time of the inner accretion disc (Fabian et al 1989; Stella\n1990; Matt & Perola 1992; Reynolds et al 1999). This timescale\n(\u223c 100M6 s for reflection from within 10rg around a black hole of\nmass 106 M6 M\u2299 ) is short enough that a single, long observation\ncan span many light-crossing times. This has motivated observational efforts to find variations in the line flux (e.g. Iwasawa et al.\n1996, 1999; Reynolds 2000; Vaughan & Edelson 2001; Shih, Iwasawa & Fabian 2002). These analyses indicated that the iron line\nin MCG\u20136-30-15 was indeed variable on timescales of \u223c 104 s,\nbut that the amplitude of the variations was considerably less than\nexpected and the variations were not correlated with the observed\ncontinuum. The data also showed a strong correlation between\nthe photon index of the best-fitting power-law and the flux of the\nsource.\nIn this letter we examine the later, long XMM-Newton ob-\n\n\f2\n\nFabian et al.\n\nFigure 1. Top panel: EPIC pn (red) and combined MOS1+MOS2 (blue)\nspectra, Bottom panel: Ratio of data to a power-law model joining the 2.5\u2013\n3 keV data and 7.5\u201310 keV data (cf. Fig. 1 of Fabian et al. 2002a). As this\nis not a realistic model for the continuum the residuals should be considered merely as representative of the spectral complexity. The data from the\ntwo instruments obviously show slightly different spectral details. The inset\npanel shows the pn residuals around the iron line region with the \u223c 6.9 keV\nfeature marked.\n\nservation in more detail using a simple two-component model to\nexplain the observed spectral variability. Specifically, the data are\ncompared to the model proposed by Shih et al. (2002) comprising a\nhighly variable power-law component plus a constant (or less variable) harder component carrying the iron line. This gives a good\nfit to the data, with the harder, line-carrying component dominating\nlowest flux states of the observation. On the assumption that the\nvariable component of the spectrum is just a power-law, the variability enables us to determine the attenuation at low energies due\nto both Galactic absorption and the warm absorber in MCG\u20136-3015. It also enables us to demonstrate that there is no subtle additional absorption influencing the shape of the extensive low-energy\n\"red\" wing to the iron line.\n\nas is also clear from this plot, the detailed spectral features revealed\nby the two detectors are subtly different. As the instruments were\noperated simultaneously these differences represent differences in\nthe spectral calibration between the MOS and pn. In particular, the\npn shows a somewhat steeper spectral slope (\u0393 = 1.97 \u00b1 0.08 for\nthe pn compared to \u0393 = 1.86 \u00b1 0.15 for the MOS), a larger excess\nof emission in the 3.5\u20135.5 keV band, and obvious sharp features\naround \u223c 1.8 keV and \u223c 2.2 keV. These last two features are most\nlikely associated with the instrumental edges of Si-K at 1.84 keV\nand Au-M at 2.3 keV. The two spectra also diverge strongly below\n\u223c 0.6 keV.\nDetailed spectral fits to the 2.5\u201310.0 keV spectrum were presented in Fabian et al. (2002a) based on the MOS data only. These\ngave a more conservative estimate of the strength and breadth of\nthe broad iron line than the pn data. The greater excess in the\npn data in the 3.5\u20135.5 keV band leads to an apparently stronger\nline with a significantly stronger red wing. Fitting Model 31 of\nFabian et al. (2002a) to the 2.5\u201310 keV pn spectrum gave a good fit\n(\u03c72 = 1310.9 for 1492 degrees of freedom, dof ) with the following parameters: continuum slope \u0393 = 2.02 \u00b1 0.01, disc inclination\ni = 27.5 \u00b1 0.9 deg, inner radius rin = 1.95 \u00b1 0.03rg , break radius rbr = 6.1+0.8\n\u22120.5 rg , inner emissivity index qin = 5.5 \u00b1 0.3,\nouter emissivity index qout = 2.7 \u00b1 0.1 and a line equivalent\nwith of EW = 685+50\n\u221232 eV. The equivalent width of the possible\n\u223c 6.9 keV emission line is EW = 17 \u00b1 3 eV.\nIt should be noted that while the above calibration problems\nremain with the EPIC spectral responses, it is not clear whether\nthe MOS or the pn data give a more accurate description of the\nshape of the broad iron line. However, while the absolute values of\nbest-fitting model parameters are sensitive to detector-dependent\ncalibration, the spectral variability characteristics should be, to first\norder at least, independent of these problems. Therefore, the pn data\nare used for the purposes of the spectral variability analysis below\nas they have the highest signal-to-noise ratio. It should be noted\nthat while the form of the spectral variability should be calibrationindependent, the exact details of any spectral models will remain\nsensitive to the calibration uncertainties outlined above.\n2.2 Spectral variability\n\n2 ANALYSIS\n\n2.2.1 The difference spectrum\n\nFabian et al. (2002a) discuss details of the observation and basic\ndata reduction. For the present paper the data were reprocessed\nentirely with the latest software (SAS v5.3.3) but the procedure followed that discussed in the previous paper (except that\nthis time the source extraction radius was 35 arcsec). For both the\nEPIC pn and MOS data, standard spectral redistribution matrices\nwere used and ancillary responses were generated using ARFGEN\nv1.48.10. The source spectra were fitted using XSPEC v11.1\n(Arnaud 1996) and the quoted errors on the derived model parameters correspond to a 90 per cent confidence level for one interesting\nparameter (i.e. a \u2206\u03c72 = 2.7 criterion), unless otherwise stated,\nand fit parameters (specifically line and edge energies) are quoted\nfor the rest frame of the source.\n2.1 EPIC spectra\n\nIn this section the two-component model discussed in Shih et al.\n(2002) is applied to spectra obtained from the XMM-Newton observation. If the spectrum can be broken into two distinct emission\ncomponents then the observed spectrum during any given time interval, accounting for the effects of absorption, can be written as\nS = A \u00d7 (N1 s1 + N2 s2 ), where s1 and s2 represent the spectra of\nthe two emission components, N1 and N2 are their normalisations,\nrespectively, and A gives the absorption profile.\nShih et al. (2002) found that such a model adequately described the spectral variability observed in MCG\u20136-30-15 by\nASCA, with one component having a constant flux while the other\nvaried only in normalisation. If the spectral variability can indeed\nbe described in terms of a variable emission component and another component that remains constant (or, at least, varies very little\non the timescales of interest) then it becomes possible to examine\nthe absorption profile using the spectral variability. The difference\n\nFig. 1 shows the time-averaged EPIC pn and MOS spectra for the\nentire dataset compared to a simple power-law model fitted between 2.5\u20133.0 keV and 7.5\u201310.0 keV. The emission feature peaking\nat 6.4 keV is prominent, as is the absorption below 2 keV. However,\n\n1 Model 3 consists of a power-law continuum plus a pexrav reflection\ncomponent (R = 1) and an iron line, both relativistically blurred using a\nbroken power-law emissivity function.\n\n\fThe iron line in MCG\u20136-30-15 from XMM-Newton\n\n3\n\nFigure 2. EPIC pn light curve (0.2\u201310 keV) showing the 10 ks intervals flux discussed in the text. (This light curve has not been corrected for the live-time of\nthe pn camera in small-window mode, which is just a scaling factor.)\n\nbetween two spectra that differ significantly in flux (different N1\nbut identical N2 ) is simply A \u00d7 (N1,high \u2212 N1,low )s1 . The difference spectrum is thus the spectrum of the variable component\nonly, modified by absorption. If the variable spectral component is\na power-law, as suggested by Shih et al. (2002), then the difference\nbetween two spectra of different fluxes should be a simple powerlaw modified by (Galactic and intrinsic warm) absorption.\nIn order to examine this possibility the XMM-Newton observation was divided into 32 \u00d7 10 ks intervals (Fig. 2) from each\nof which spectra were obtained. The lowest-flux spectrum is from\ninterval 303:k. A high-flux spectrum was extracted from the first\n80 ksec of data from this revolution (303:a\u2013h). The average count\nrate during the high-flux interval is 32.6 ct s\u22121 and during the lowflux interval the count rate is 13.5 ct s\u22121 (after correcting for the\nlive-time of the pn camera in small-window mode). Subtracting the\ntwo spectra (i.e. high\u2212low), accounting for the difference in exposure times, gives the difference spectrum shown in Fig. 3.\n\nFigure 3. Top panel: The difference spectrum (high\u2212low). Bottom panel:\nData/model residuals when the difference spectrum is compared to a simple\npower-law model fitted only above 3 keV (red crosses) and a power-law\nmodified by a simple absorber (green circles).\n\n2.2.2 A simple absorption model\nAcross the 3\u201310 keV band the difference spectrum is well fitted\nby a power-law, with photon index \u0393 = 2.11 \u00b1 0.05. The strong,\nbroad iron line, while clear in both the high- and low-flux spectra\nwhen examined separately, is not apparent in the difference spectrum. The iron line flux must be very similar in these two spectra,\neven though the total (i.e. continuum) flux differs by a factor of\nabout 2 above 7 keV. This then implies a very strong line equivalent width during the low-flux interval.\nExtrapolating the power-law model to 0.5 keV reveals the attenuation spectrum of the source (Fig. 3). The warm absorber is\nclear as the large drop above \u223c 0.7 keV which recovers by about\n2 keV, and the Galactic absorption mostly accounts for the decrease at lower energies. These features can be accounted for using a very simple absorption model (similar to that used to model\nASCA data of the source; Otani et al 1996) comprising a powerlaw modified by absorption from neutral gas of column density\nNH = 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , explained by the Galactic column\ndensity (4.06 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 ; Elvis, Lockman & Wilkes 1989), to-\n\ngether with two warm absorption edges (at E1 = 0.72\u00b10.005 keV\nof depth \u03c42 = 0.61\u00b10.03 and at E2 = 0.86\u00b10.01 keV with depth\n\u03c42 = 0.19\u00b10.04). The obvious candidates for such edges are OVII\nand OVIII, respectively.\nWe note that the above simple absorption model may be adequate for fitting data at CCD resolution above 1 keV but cannot\nbe the whole explanation for data below that energy, where absorption by lines and Unresolved Transition Arrays are expected.\nThe important point for the present work is that there are no major\nabsorption features associated with iron-K, i.e. above 7 keV, nor\nwith Si, S etc between 2\u20134 keV. The broad iron emission line is not\nstrongly affected by any absorption features. Very similar results\nare obtained if the absolute minimum, 11 ks, spectrum from within\nintervals 303:k and l is used. Note that these results depend on the\nabsorption not varying, which is consistent with the rms variability\nspectrum (Fabian et al 2002a) showing no edges.\n\n\f4\n\nFabian et al.\n\nFigure 4. From top to bottom the panels show: a) Data/model ratio plot\nfrom fitting the lowest 10 ks flux spectrum with a power-law between 2\u2013\n3 keV and 7.5\u201310.0 keV (including the effects of absorption as derived\nfrom the difference spectrum); b) EFE model spectrum including relativistic blurring and absorption effects; c) the intrinsic model spectrum (note\nlines due to OVIII and OVII below 0.7 keV); and d) the data/model ratio of\nthe best fitting model in the 1\u201310 keV band extended down to 0.5 keV.

The RDC normalization is approximately constant and shows variations of up to \u00b125 per cent, with\nthe variations showing no obvious correlation with other parameters.\n\n2.2.3 The low-flux spectrum\nThe absorption model derived above was then applied to the spectrum obtained from the low-flux interval. Fitting this spectrum with\na power-law, and including the absorption as described above, reveals the very strong iron emission line and an excess of emission\nbelow \u223c 1.5 keV (Fig. 4).\nThe iron line can be modelled by a LAOR profile (Laor 1991)\nwith a high equivalent width (EW = 1.4 keV) extending into an\ninner radius of 1.8rg with an emissivity profile index of 3.3 \u00b1 0.3.\nThe spectrum can also be fitted reasonably well with the constant\ndensity ionised disc model of Ross, Young & Fabian (1999), when\nrelativistic blurring is included (again using a broken emissivity\nlaw). The model used included three times solar abundances and\nthe best-fitting ionisation parameter was \u03be = 10, with the reflection component dominating over the power-law (R = 5.5). We\nhereafter refer to this spectral model as the Reflection-Dominated\nComponent (RDC) .\n\n2.2.4 Fitting the whole light curve\nWe now extend the study of the simple, absorbed, two-component\nmodel to the whole dataset. A model consisting of the simple absorption model from Section 2.2.2 applied to the best-fitting RDC\nand a Power-Law Component (PLC), with all parameters apart\nfrom the normalizations and PLC photon index fixed, was then fitted to all 32 spectra over the energy band 1\u201310 keV.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 5. All fits gave acceptable values of \u03c72 . The photon index \u0393 of the PLC is seen to lie between\n2 and 2.3 for most of the spectra. The deviant results occur when\nthe PLC normalization is low and disappear if the fit is made over\nthe 2\u201310 keV band. It is possible that there are small changes in the\n\n3 INTERPRETATION\nWe have shown that the spectral variability of MCG\u20136-30-15,\non timescales of 10 ks, is accounted for by an almost constant\nreflection-dominated component together with a highly variable\npower-law component, which has an almost constant photon index,\nsupporting the model of Shih et al (2001). We now attempt to interpret the source using a two component RDC plus PLC model. An\nalternative interpretation, in which the line is progressively ionized\nand weakened as the source brightens, is presented and discussed\nby Ballantyne, Vaughan & Fabian (2002).\nExplaining the constant emission component provides us with\na significant challenge. It appears to be mostly due to reflection.\nHowever it is not simply due to reflection of the observed powerlaw component since that repeatedly varies by factors of two or\nmore on short timescales (but not shorter than the inferred emission\nregion size, if it is indeed only a few rg ). In other words the RDC\nand PLC appear to be separate. Since however both show the effects\nof the warm absorber they must originate in a similar location to\nwithin the dimensions of the warm absorber (probably less than\n1 pc). As the iron line in the RDC indicates emission peaking at\nonly a few gravitational radii we shall henceforth assume that this\nis indeed where that component originates. We then have to explain\nwhy so little of the continuum which causes the line is observed and\nwhy the power-law continuum we do see does not seem to have any\nassociated reflection.\nWe are driven to consider that the intrinsic X-ray emission is\nanisotropic, so that the reflection component is a smoothed average of many variable power-law components, most of which do not\nilluminate our line of sight. This could be due to source geometry, relativistic beaming of the emitters, or to the general relativistic\n\n\fThe iron line in MCG\u20136-30-15 from XMM-Newton\nbending of light expected from an emission region so close to the\nblack hole. We now address each of these in turn.\n3.1 Geometrical effects\nAs discussed by Fabian et al. (2002b) in the case of 1H 0707\u2013495,\nthe surface of the disc could be corrugated. If the continuum is\nemitted close to the surface within the corrugations then it could\nshow large apparent variability as part of it disappears within a corrugation. The reflected component could be strong, since we are\nonly seeing part of the intrinsic PLC (and multiple reflection may\noperate; Ross et al. 2002), and be approximately constant.\n3.2 Intrinsic beaming\nIf the emitting region, or the emitting electrons, are relativistic, then\nthe emission can be beamed. We may see variations as beams from\ndifferent regions or populations of electrons sweep our line of sight.\nReflection from the disc however responds to the average of many\nbeams sweeping over it. Note that if the particles are relativistic\nthen the reflection can be strong due to the intrinsic anisotropy of\nthe inverse-Compton process (Ghisellini et al. 1991).\n\n5\n\nwell represented by the sum of an almost constant reflectiondominated component and a highly variable power-law component.\nWe emphasise that this is only an approximation to the spectral\nvariability as it does not account for the observed changes in the\npower-spectral density with energy, nor the hard lags (Vaughan et\nal 2002). Acting on both is a warm absorber, which above 1 keV\nis relatively simple and dominated by highly-ionized oxygen. Provided that the emission predominantly originates from about 2rg ,\nthen the strengths of the components and their behaviour are accounted from by strong gravtiational light-bending. The black hole\nin this case is presumably spinning rapidly.\nStrong broad iron lines in active galactic nuclei may require\nthe central black hole to have a high spin in order that returning\nradiation creates a strong reflection component. If the rapid variability in MCG\u20136-30-15 is in part due to strong light-bending amplifying small changes in source height, then the similarity with the\ntiming behaviour of the soft state of Cygnus X-1 (Vaughan, Fabian\n& Nandra 2002) suggests that it too may be rapidly spinning. Further extrapolation to the variability of many Narrow-Line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies (e.g. Boller et al 1997) is also interesting.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n3.3 General relativistic effects\nIf we accept the evidence from the line shape the the emission peaks\nat say 2rg , then the returning radiation (Cunninham 1975) will be\nvery important (see also Martocchia et al. 2002; Dabrowski et al.\n1997). An observer on the disc at that radius would see much of\nthe Sky covered by disc, due to gravitational light bending. The\nreflection is therefore strong and dominated by the average PLC\nemission from the opposite side of the disc. The PLC which we\nsee will be dominated by the approaching side, perhaps associated\nwith the plunge region just within the marginally stable orbit (Krolik 1999, Agol & Krolik 2000). This will be a much smaller region,\nalso Doppler boosted, than that to which the reflection responds. If\nits height varies with time then so will the flux of the PLC, whereas\nthe RDC will see a much more constant illumination and so vary\nlittle (see Dabrowski & Lasenby 2001, Fig. 12, for the expected\nvariation in equivalent width, dominated by changes in height of\nthe PLC). The appearance of the PLC and RDC are therefore essentially decoupled, as required.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\nThe iron line in MCG\u20136-30-15 appears to indicate an extreme disc\naround a spinning black hole. We have proposed several explanations for the apparent constancy of the RDC and distinguishing between them is not simple. General relativistic effects ought however\nto be important if much of the emission originates at about 2rg .\nThey do provide a simple explanation in which small changes in\nthe height of the power-law emission region lead to large changes\nin the observed flux as a consequence of gravitational light bending; much of the flux is bent onto the disk giving a strong, almost\nconstant, reflection component. This model will be pursued in detail elsewhere.\nIf instead the emission is anisotropic due to relativistic beaming, then the PLC might extend as a power-law to high energies,\nperhaps above 500 keV as seen in the hard tail in the soft state of\nCygnus X-1.\nIn summary, we find that the spectrum of MCG\u20136-30-15 is\n\nBased on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded\nby ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).
