Moreover, the core dark matter distribution may offer insight into the structure formation\nprocess. Unfortunately, cluster cores also tend to be the site of complicated astrophysics. X-ray\nimaging spectroscopy of relaxed clusters, a standard technique for mapping their dark matter\ndistributions, is often complicated by the presence of their putative \"cooling flow\" gas, and the dark\nmatter profile one derives for a cluster is sensitive to assumptions made about the distribution of this\ngas. Here we present a statistical analysis of these assumptions and their effect on our understanding\nof dark matter in galaxy clusters.\n\nIntroduction\nThe cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm of modern cosmology has enjoyed spectacular\nsuccess in describing the formation of large-scale structure in the universe [1, 2, 3, 4].\nGalaxy-scale dark matter halos, however, exhibit several apparent inconsistencies with\nCDM, for example: the number of Milky Way satellites appears to be at least an order\nof magnitude lower than CDM predictions [5, 6, 7], and dark matter halos in dwarf and\nlow surface brightness galaxies are much less cuspy than in CDM simulations [8, 9, 4].\nSome reports [11, 12] even suggest that CDM fails on galaxy cluster scales for some\nclusters, but the latter are controversial [13, 14].\nIf CDM does indeed require alterations, there is no shortage of tailors. Proposed\nmodifications include, though are not limited to, self-interacting dark matter [15, 16],\nwarm dark matter [17], annihilating dark matter [18], scalar field dark matter [19, 20],\nand mirror matter [21], each of which is invoked to soften the core density profile. Many\nof these modifications will soften the core profile of galaxy clusters as well, although\nother astrophysical processes such as the adiabatic contraction of core baryons [22] may\nameliorate this effect. Baryons, however, introduce a host of complications to CDM\nsimulations; their effects will require a great deal of effort to disentangle [23].\nIn order to discriminate among CDM, its modifications, and other astrophysical influences, we have initiated a program to map the dark matter profiles of a sample of galaxy\ncluster cores. We use imaging spectroscopy from Chandra X-ray Observatory obser-\n\n\f- - The Emergence of Cosmic Structure - -\n\n2\n\nvations [24] and archival data [25] to extract the deprojected radial dependence of the\nbaryon density and temperature of each cluster. In order to extract a dark matter profile\nfrom spatially resolved X-ray spectroscopy one usually assumes that the galaxy cluster\nis spherically symmetric and in hydrostatic equilibrium, and so for the most part we\nhave restricted our sample to clusters for which these assumptions are most likely valid.\nUnfortunately, these clusters often contain \"cooling flow\" gas in their cores which complicates the spatial and spectral models. How one models the X-ray emission from this\ncool gas can significantly alter the resulting dark matter profile. If the model contains\nonly a single emitting component (at temperature T and density \u03c1 ) at each radius, the\ninferred temperature profile will tend to dip significantly toward the center of a cooling\nflow cluster. If, however, gas in the the central few radial bins contains a second (cooler)\ncomponent which is cospatial and isobaric with the first, the hot gas temperature profile\nremains flat into the core. The latter case tends to produce a larger central mass (see Figure 1A) and steeper density profile than the the former.\nOur problem, then, is \u0005 the age-old\n\u0004\nexercise of choosing between a simple model M and a complex model M . Once we\nhave done this, we will be better able to address the other issues listed above.\n\nModels\nIn order to ascertain the importance of a second emission component we adopt a\nsimplified geometry\ncontaining only two spherical shells (inner = 1, outer = 2). In both\n\u0004\n\u0005\nmodels (M and M ), \u0004 shell 2 contains a (hot) thermal plasma at temperature T2h and\nin shell 1, characterized\ndensity \u03c12h . Model M contains only one emission component\n\u0005\nby a temperature T1h and a density \u03c11h , whereas model M contains a hot and a cool\nemission component in shell 1, described by T1h , \u03c11h , T1c , and \u03c11c . The X-ray emission\nfrom each component is modelled spectroscopically as using the M EKAL [26, 27, 28, 29]\nmodel as implemented in the X SPEC software package [30]. The best-fit parameter\nHereafter\nwe will\nvalues of each model are calculated using a \u03c7 2 minimization routine.\n\u0004\n\u0005\nrefer to\nthe simple and complex model\nparameters using vectors \u03b8 and \u03b8 , respectively;\n\u0004\u0007\u0006 \b\n\u0005 \u0006 \b\ni.e., \u03b8\nT1h \u03c11h T2h \u03c12h and \u03b8\nT1h \u03c11h T1c \u03c11c T2h \u03c12h .\nAt this point, tradition dictates that we employ a statistical test from the standard\narsenals [31, 32, 33], such as the\nlikelihood ratio test or\u0005 the F-test,\u0006 to choose between the\n\u0004\ntwo models. However, since \u03b8 lies on a boundary of \u03b8 (with \u03c11c 0), these tests cannot\nbe employed [34]. Instead, we construct an empirical F-distribution using Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and gauge the significance of the complex model from\nthe location of the F value of the data within that distribution [34].\n\nConstructing an empirical F-distribution\n\u0004\n\nStarting with the best-fit parameters \u03b80 of model M , we sample the 4D parameter\nspace in its vicinity using MCMC sampling. This is done by running a Tcl script within\nX SPEC which calculates the probability distribution function P of a trial perturbation\n\u03b81 about \u03b80 given the observed data. The trial point is chosen using the trial distribu-\n\n\f- - The Emergence of Cosmic Structure - -\n\nA\n\n3\n\nB\n\nFIGURE 1.

The choice of q is arbitrary; we restrict\nourselves\nto functions\n\b\n\u0006\n\b\nq \u03b8 j \u03b8i (this is\nwhich are symmetric in parameter space transitions, i.e. q \u03b8i \u03b8 j\nthe Metropolis algorithm \u2013 see ftp://ftp.cs.utoronto.ca/pub/radford/\nreview.ps.Z; in\nthis example\nwe used a 4D gaussian deviate). This new parameter\n\b\n\b\nset is accepted if P \u03b81 \u0013\u0012 P \u03b80 exceeds a random number on [0,1]. If not, the trial point is\nrejected and new one is selected. \b The sequence of accepted \u03b8i is a Markov Chain whose\nstationary distribution follows\nP \u03b8 [35]. We repeat this procedure until we have 100\n\u0004\nvalues of \u03b8 for model M .\nFor each of the parameter sets in the sample we simulate an X-ray spectrum, taking\nproper account of the instrument response\nand\nphoton statistics. We then model each of\n\u0004\n\u0005\nthe simulated data sets using both M and M , and tabulate the F-value of each data set:\nF\n\b\u0017\u0016\n\n\u0004\n\n\u0006\n\n\b\n\n\u0004\n\n\b\n\n\u03c7 2 \u03b8 \u0015\u0014 \u03c7 2 \u03b8\n\b \u0004\n\b\u0017\u0016 \u0004\n\u03c7 2 \u03b8 \u0013\u0012 \u03bd\n\n\u0005\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bd\nis the number of degrees of freedom of the simple model. (In practice, the\nnormalization can be ignored.) The F-distribution for the cooling flow cluster EMSS\n1358+6245 is shown in Figure 1B. The F-value of the original Chandra data set is\nindicated with a dashed line.\n\nConclusion\nOf the 100 MCMC simulations that\u0016 were\nrun, only two resulted in an F-value which\n\u0004\nexceeded that of the data \u2013 that is, if\nwere the correct description, an F-value as large\nas that observed would occur with a probability of only 2% \u2013 meaning that the model\nwith a separate, co-spatial cool component is preferred. The result is that a model with a\n\n\f- - The Emergence of Cosmic Structure - -\n\n4\n\nsteeper density profile and a larger central mass is favored. If this trend obtains for most\ncooling flow clusters, it may rule out several of the CDM modifications.\nWe have demonstrated a technique which provides a rigorous and quantitative procedure for deciding between emission models of cooling flow clusters. As we continue\nto model clusters in the Chandra archive, this method will faciliate comparisons with\nCDM simulations by helping to remove much of the uncertainty in the derivation of\ncluster core density profiles.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
