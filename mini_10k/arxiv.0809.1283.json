The major\nadvantage of studying pulsars is that we know that\nthey are powered by rotational energy loss. It is\ngenerally accepted that the rotating magnetic field\nworks as a unipolar inductor to exert a large electromotive force on the spinning neutron star (NS)\nsurface and that the resulting potential drop in the\nrotating magnetosphere leads to the acceleration of\ncharged particles to ultra-relativistic energies. The\nchallenge is then to investigate where and how they\nconvert this energy into radiation that we observe.\nThe pulsar magnetosphere can be divided into two\nzones (Fig. 1). The closed zone is filled with a dense\nplasma co-rotating with the star, whereas the open\nzone allows plasmas to flow along the open field\nlines, escaping to large distances through the light\ncylinder. Here, the light cylinder is located at distance\n\u03c0LC=c/\u03a9 from the rotation axis, where \u03a9 denotes the\nNS rotational angular frequency and c the speed of\nlight. The last-open field lines, which become parallel\nto the rotation axis at the light cylinder, form the\nborder of the open magnetic field line bundle. In all\nthe pulsar emission models, particle acceleration and\nthe resulting photon emissions take place within the\nopen zone.\n\nFig. (1). Schematic figure (side view) of the pulsar\nmagnetosphere. The slot gap extends from the stellar\nsurface to the light cylinder on the last-open field line\n(in the open zone) with trans-field thickness much less\nthan the outer gap. The outer gap is traditionally\nassumed to be located between the null charge surface\nand the light cylinder.\n\nAttempts to model the particle accelerator in a pulsar\nmagnetosphere concentrate on two scenarios: polar-cap\n(PC) models with emission altitudes within several NS\nradii above a PC surface (Harding et al. 1978;\nDaugherty & Harding 1982; Dermer & Sturner 1994;\nSturner et al. 1995), and the outer-gap (OG) models\n\n\f-2-\n\nwith acceleration occurring near the light cylinder\n(Cheng et al. 1986a, b; Chiang & Romani 1992, 1994,\nRomani & Yadigaroglu 1995; Romani 1996; Zhang\n& Cheng 1997; Cheng et al. 2000). Both models\npredict that electrons and/or positrons are accelerated\nin a charge depletion region, a potential drop, by the\nelectric field along the magnetic field lines to radiate\nhigh-energy gamma-rays via the curvature and\ninverse-Compton processes.\nIt is widely accepted from phenomenological studies\nthat coherent radio photons are emitted from the PC\naccelerator. It should be noted that the PC model\npredicts the so-called 'pencil beam' emission with a\nsmall solid angle along the magnetic axis, because\nthe emission takes place only from the lower altitudes\n(i.e., near the NS surface). Since the radio pulsation\ngenerally exhibits a single sharp peak in each\nrotational period, we can reproduce such pulse\nprofiles if the observer's viewing angle is close to the\nmagnetic inclination angle. However, to explain the\nincoherent high energy emissions, which generally\nexhibit widely separated double peaks, one has to\ninvoke a very small magnetic inclination angle and\nthe observer's viewing angle with respect to the\nrotation axis. Thus, to explain the \u03b3-ray pulsations\ndetected from all the six brightest pulsars (for Crab,\nNolan et al. 1993, Fierro et al. 1998; for Vela,\nKanbach et al. 1994; Fierro et al. 1998; for Geminga,\nMayer-Hasselwander et al. 1994; Fierro et al. 1994;\nfor PSR B1706-44, Thompson et al. 1996; for B150958, Matz et al. 1994; for B1951+32, Ramanamurthy\net al. 1995, Kuiper et al. 1998) in terms of the spindown luminosity, a high-altitude emission, which\nresults in the so-called 'fan beam' emission with a\nlarge solid angle (~1 ster), drew attention as an\nalternative possibility.\nThe possibility of a high-altitude extension of the PC\naccelerator was originally introduced by Arons &\nScharlemann (ApJ 1979). Developing this\nelectrodynamical model, and incorporating general\nrelativistic effects (Muslimov and Tsygan 1992,\nhereafter MT92), Muslimov & Harding (2003,\nhereafter MH03) began discussing high-energy\nemission from the pulsar slot gap (SG), a narrow\nregion on the last-open field line where the magneticfield-aligned electric field, E||, is decreasing and\naccelerating particles cannot create pairs. Then\nMuslimov & Harding (2004, hereafter MH04)\nextended this lower-altitude solution (within a few\nstellar radii) to higher altitudes (near the light\ncylinder) and found that curvature radiation of the\nprimary particles forms caustic patterns, as suggested\nin the two-pole caustic model proposed by Dyks &\nRudak (2003). Subsequently, Dyks et al. (2004)\nexamined polarization characteristics and found that\nfast swings of the position angle and minima of\npolarization degree can be qualitatively reproduced\n\nwithin their two-pole caustic model. This type of\nemission, SG emission, fills the whole sky and all\nphases in a light curve. That is, most observers catch\nemission from the two poles, if their viewing angle, \u03b6obs,\nis in a reasonable range (e.g., 45o<\u03b6obs<125o for \u03b1 >30o,\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the magnetic inclination). More\nrecently, Harding et al. (2008, hereafter HSDF08)\ninvestigated the SG emission, adding synchrotron\nradiation of the gap-accelerated primaries and highergeneration pairs produced at lower-altitude PC region.\nThey applied the model to the Crab pulsar and\npredicted the pulse profiles and the phase-resolved\nspectra, which are roughly consistent with the\nobservations from 0.3 keV to 10 GeV.\nAn alternative way to consider a high-altitude emission\nis the OG model. To examine the OG quantitatively,\nHirotani & Shibata (1999a, b) first solved the set of\nMaxwell and Boltzmann equations in a pulsar\nmagnetosphere, extending the method originally\nproposed for a pair-production cascade in a rotating\nblack-hole magnetosphere (Beskin et al. 1992; Hirotani\n& Okamoto 1998). Before Hirotani & Shibata (1999a),\nthe accelerator position, strength of E||, and even the\nexistence of the OG itself, have been hypothesized;\nhowever, they demonstrated, in their one-dimensional\nanalysis of a pair-production cascade along the\nmagnetic field line, that the OG does exist as the\nsolution of the set of the Maxwell and Boltzmann\nequations. After that, a number of papers appeared in\nthe same context (for one-dimensional solution along\nthe magnetic field lines, see, Hirotani et al. 2003; for\ntwo-dimensional solutions, see Takata et al. 2006;\nHirotani 2006, 2007a, b; Takata et al. 2008), confirming\nthat the traditional OG models give qualitatively good\nagreement with these self-consistent solutions. In the\npresent paper, we extend the method presented in\nHirotani (2006, hereafter H06), which analyzes the OG\nelectrodynamics in the 2-D poloidal plane and in the 2D momentum space (neglecting the dependence on\ntoroidal momenta in the distribution functions of\nparticles and photons) into 3-D configuration space and\n3-D momentum space. For example, in the present\npaper, photon propagation and pair production is solved\nin the full 3-D magnetosphere. We demonstrate that the\nOG solution is uniquely obtained if we specify the NS\nrotational period, P, magnetic dipole moment, \u03bc,\nsurface temperature, kT, and \u03b1, without introducing any\nartificial assumptions. Phase-resolved spectra and pulse\nprofiles can be predicted, if we additionally give \u03b6obs\nand the distance to the pulsar, d.\nIn the next section, we present the basic equations.\nThen in section 3, we demonstrate that the obtained\nsolution quantifies the phenomenological OG models\ndiscussed so far. In section 4, we apply the same\nmethod to the SG model and point out its difficulties.\nWe finally discuss some implications in section 5.\n\n\f-3-\n\n2 BASIC EQUATIONS\n2.1.

On the NS\nsurface, \u03b8 and \u03c6-\u03a9 t are related with \u03b8 * and \u03c6 * by the\nfollowing two equations:\n\ncos \u03b8* = sin \u03b1 sin \u03b8 cos(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9t ) + cos \u03b1 cos \u03b8 , (10)\n\ncos \u03b8 = \u2212 sin \u03b1 sin \u03b8* cos \u03c6* + cos \u03b1 cos \u03b8* .\n\n(11)\n\nFor example, if the NS is rotating with period P=33 ms\nand magnetic inclination angle \u03b1 =60o, the angular\ncoordinates (\u03b8 *, \u03c6 *) distribute on the polar cap (PC)\nsurface as depicted in figure 2; \u03c6 * is measured counterclockwise from the x axis, where the rotation axis\nresides in the \u2013x direction (i.e., leftwards).

The explicit expressions of S+ and S- are\ngiven by equations (36)-(44) in H06. Since the energy\ntransfer in an emission of a single curvature photon is\ntoo small to resolve with the current energy grids, we\ntake into account the synchro-curvature effects in the\nright-hand side as the radiation-reaction force, PSC/c; its\nexplicit form is given by Chang & Zhang (1996), or\nequations (32)-(35) in H06. For relativistic particles, the\nLorentz factor is given by \u0393=p/(mec).\n2.4. Photon Boltzmann equation\nSince the gap is assumed to be stationary in the corotating frame, the Boltzmann equation for photons\nbecomes (H06)\n\n\u239b k\u03c6\n\u239e \u2202g\nk r \u2202g\nk \u03b8 \u2202g\n\u2212\n\u03a9\n+\n+\n= S\u03b3 , (21)\nc\nc\nc\n\u239c\n\u239f\nk \u2202r\nk \u2202\u03b8\n\u239d k\n\u23a0 \u2202\u03c6\nwhere \u03c6 =\u03c6 -\u03a9 t and k\u2261(-kiki)1/2. The photon\npropagation (r,\u03b8, k r,k\u03b8) in the curved spacetime can be\ncomputed by geometrical optics (see section 2.4 in\nH06) if we give the initial photon propagation direction\nat the emission point. We could assume that photons are\nemitted along the local field lines in the co-rotating\nframe and their propagation direction changes due to\naberration. However, since there is relative acceleration\nbetween the co-rotating and static frames, applying\nspecial relativity becomes bad in the outer\nmagnetosphere and completely breaks down outside the\nlight cylinder. Thus, in this paper, we follows the\nargument of relativistic plasma flows and adopt (Mestel\net al. 1985, Camenzind 1986a,b)\n\n\f-5-\n\nur = \u03ba Br ,\nu \u03b8 = \u03ba B\u03b8 ,\n\nu\u03c6 \u2212 \u03a9u t = \u03ba\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\n\u2212 B\u03c6\nc 2 \u03c1 w2\n\n,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the four velocity u\u03bc is related with the\nobserved velocity dx\u03bc/dt by u\u03bc =ut(dx\u03bc/dt). Since the\ndefinition of the proper time, u\u03bc u\u03bc=c2, gives ut, we\ncan compute the photon emission direction observed\nby a distant static observer by the ratios, ur/u, u\u03b8/u,\nand u\u03c6/u, where u=(-uiui)1/2.\n2.5. Boundary conditions\nTo solve the set of partial differential equations (8),\n(17), and (21) for \u03a8, n+, n-, and g, we must impose\nappropriate boundary conditions. First, let us consider\nthe elliptic type equation (8). For convenience, we\nput \u03a8 =0 on the NS surface, that is, the inner\nboundary. We assume that the lower boundary\ncoincides with the last-open field lines, \u03b8\u2217=\u03b8*max(\u03c6 *),\nwhich is grounded to the star; thus, we also impose\n\u03a8 =0 on the lower boundary. Since pair production is\ncopious above a certain height from the last-open\nfield line, and since E|| is highly screened by the\ndischarge of the produced pairs there, we can safely\nassume that \u03a8 =0 also holds above a certain height,\n\u03b8\u2217=(1-hm)\u03b8*max(\u03c6 *). If we take a larger hm, colatitudinal grid resolution becomes bad. If we take a\nsmaller hm, on the other hand, there is a risk of\nexcluding active field lines from consideration. For\nthe Crab pulsar, we find that hm = 0.26 is a good\ncompromise. The results change little if we increase\n(or decrease) hm 30% from this value. We\nparameterize magnetic co-latitudes with\n\nh \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03b8* / \u03b8*max\n\n(25)\n\nand solve the gap in 0 < h < hm, where h =0 gives the\nlast-open field line. The outer boundary is defined as\nthe place where E|| changes sign near the light\ncylinder and found to appear near the place where\n\u2202 ( \u03c1GJ / B) / \u2202s vanishes due to the curving up of the\n\nions do not efficiently radiate, they contribute to the\ncharge density in the outer magnetosphere and reduce\nE|| to some extent; this contribution is included in the\nreal charge density \u03c1 in the Poisson equation (8). Since\nwe are going to consider copious radiation, pair\nproduction, and global electric current flows, we do not\nspeculate the possibility of the formation of the\n'electrosphere' as suggested by Krause-Polstorff &\nMichel (1985) and Wada & Shibata (2007).\nThroughout this paper, we consider a rotator in the\nsense that the magnetic axis resides in the same\nhemisphere as the rotation axis, that is, \u03a9i B > 0 . In\nthis case, \u03c1GJ<0 holds in the PC region.\n\n3. Results: Outer-gap solution\nIn this section, we apply the method to the Crab pulsar.\nAs representative values, we adopt \u03b1 =60o, kT=100 eV,\nand \u03bc=4\u00d71030 G cm3. Since we are motivated to\nelucidate the gap electrodynamics in this paper, we do\nnot adjust these parameters to obtain better fits with\nobservations.\n3.1. 3-D gap geometry\nLet us begin by presenting the solved gap geometry in\nthe 3-D magnetosphere. Since E|| decreases towards the\nconvex side of the curved field lines (i.e., with\nincreasing h) relatively gradually, we can practically\ndefine hm, above which gap activity is negligible. To\ngrasp how the gap activity decreases at larger h, let us\nfirst present the potential drop along each field line in\nfigure 3, which represents the potential drop as a\nfunction of the gap height h measured from the lastopen field line, and of the magnetic azimuth \u03c6 *. The\npotential drop takes the maximum value \u03a8max~1.4\u00d71015\nV in the leading side (in this case, \u03c6 *~1 rad) due to less\nefficient pair production there. The figure tells us that\nthe potential drop decreases enough around hm=0.16.\n\nfield lines towards the rotation axis (see discussion\naround eq. [67] in H06 for physical reasoning).\nNext, let us consider the hyperbolic type equations\n(17) and (21). In the same manner as in the 2-D\nanalysis, we assume in this 3-D examination that\nelectrons, positrons and photons do not penetrate into\nthe gap across the inner and outer boundaries.\nHowever, if the created current becomes greater than\nthe Goldreich-Julian value, a positive E|| is\nmaintained at the NS surface, which leads to an\nextraction of ions from the surface as a SCLF (see\nsection 2.5 of H06 for details). Even though these\n\nFig. (3) Distribution of the electrostatic potential drop\n[V] along the field line that thread the NS surface at\nmagnetic colatitude h and azimuth \u03c6 *.\n\n\f-6-\n\nFig. (4) Gap trans-field thickness on the last-open\nfield line bundle. The red curve denotes the\nintersection with the null surface where \u03c1GJ vanishes.\n\nFig. (5) Distribution of the maximum E|| [V m-1] near\nthe gap center (in the meridional direction) at each\npoint on the 2-D last-open field line surface (s,\u03c6 *).\n\nTo quantify hm, we define hm above which\nE||<0.01 \u03a8max/\u03c0LC holds. The gap thickness defined in\nthis way, distributes on the last-open field line\nsurface (i.e., s-\u03c6 * plane), as shown in figure 4. It\nshows that the gap is active outside the null surface,\nas originally suggested by Cheng et al. (1986a). The\nobtained gap thickness, h~0.2 is consistent with\nphenomenological OG models (e.g., Tang et al. 2007).\n3.2. Acceleration electric field\nThe magnetic-field-aligned electric field, E||,\nmaximizes near the center (h~0.08) of the red/yellow\n'island' in figure 3. This maximum E|| at each (s,\u03c6 *)\nis depicted in figure 5. Since photons propagate into\nsmaller \u03c6 * direction (i.e., propagate clockwise in the\nco-rotating frame), unless the field lines become\nmostly toroidal (as expected outside the light\ncylinder), pairs are preferentially produced in the\ntrailing side (i.e., at smaller \u03c6 *). As a result, E|| is\nscreened and hence potential drop decreases (fig. 3)\nin the trailing side, making the second peak weaker\nthan the first peak (section 3.3). Figure 5 also shows\nthat E|| is substantially screened in the inner part of\nthe gap. This is because the produced pairs discharge\nso that the original E|| may be reduced.\nIn figure 6, we present the charge density per\nmagnetic flux tube, \u03c1/(\u03a9B/2\u03c0c), as the solid curve,\ntogether with \u03c1GJ/(\u03a9B/2\u03c0c) as dashed. It follows that\n\u03c1/B has a similar gradient with \u03c1GJ/B; this result is\nconsistent with the analytical condition (section 3.3 in\nH06) so that E|| is screened most efficiently. It is\nworth noting that ions could be extracted as a SCLF\nfrom the NS surface if the produced current exceeds\nthe GJ value at the NS surface (section 3.3 in H06).\nIn this case, the real charge density increases from the\ndotted curve to the solid one, where the former only\nincludes the contribution of only the electrons and\npositrons produced in the gap.\n\nFig. (6) Total (solid), created (dotted), and GoldreichJulian (dashed) charge densities in (\u03a9B/2\u03c0c) unit, for\n\u03c6 *=-30o at four different co-latitude, h. The solid curve\nincludes the ionic contribution, while the dotted curve\nrepresents that from the electrons and positrons only.\n\n3.3. Photon mapping result and pulse profile\nWe plot the photon intensity on the pulse phase \u03a6 vs.\nobserver's viewing angle \u03b6obs plane in figure 7. The\nphotons emitted from the north magnetic pole would\nappear at \u03a6 =0 and \u03b6obs =\u03b1 (=60o). The left panel shows\nthat the OG connected to the north pole emits outwardpropagating photons in \u03b6obs >90o, and -140o<\u03a6 < 40o,\nwhile inward ones in \u03b6obs <90o and 130o<\u03a6 < 300o (=60o). On the contrary, from the south-pole OG, inwardpropagating photons appear in \u03b6obs >90o and -50o<\u03a6 <\n120o. Thus, the intensity around \u03b6obs ~120o and \u03a6 ~ 0o\nconsists of both the outward emission from the northpole OG and the inward emission from the south-pole\nOG (right panel). This result is consistent with\nphenomenological 3-D OG models (Takata et al. 2007;\nTang et el. 2008) and self-consistent 2-D OG solution\n(Takata et al. 2008).\n\n\f-7-\n\nFig. (7) Phase plot of the photons having energies above 90 MeV. Left: Emission from the north-pole OG alone;\nright: emission from the both poles. Reddened regions indicate strong intensity.\n\nFig. (8) Pulse profile for nine different viewing angles, \u03b6obs. Normalization is common in all the panels.\nIf we superpose the south-pole SG emissions and\nspecify \u03b6obs, we obtain the pulse profile as presented\nin figure 8, which demonstrates how the profile\ndepends on \u03b6obs. Comparing with observations,\npreferable \u03b6obs is found to be in the range 105o<\u03b6obs\n<125o for \u03b1 =60o. We should notice here that the first\npeak (P1) composed of the outward emission from\nthe outer-most part of the OG, of which distance from\n\nthe rotation axis is \u03c0 >0.7 \u03c0LC. Thus, the shape,\nstrength, and profile of P1 may have to be revised if we\nincorporate the magnetic field deformation due to\nmagnetospheric currents near the light cylinder, instead\nof giving the magnetic field configuration from the\ncurrent-free, rotating magnetic dipole formula as in the\npresent work.\n\n\f-8-\n\nFig. (9) Phase-averaged (top left) and phase-resolved (others) spectrum of the pulsed emission from the Crab\npulsar. The thin solid, dashed, and dotted curves denote the un-absorbed photon fluxes of primary, secondary, and\ntertiary components, respectively, while the thick red solid one presents the spectrum to be observed, including\nabsorption along the line of sight. Interstellar absorption is not considered. The filled circles (LECS), open circles\n(MECS), filled triangles (PDS) denote the Boppo SAX observations, while the open triangle the Gamma-ray\nImaging Spectrometer (GRIS), and inverse filled triangles (OSSE), diamonds (COMPTEL), and filled squares\n(EGRET) denotes the CGRO observations. Data points are from Kuiper et al. (2001)\n[http://www.sron.nl/divisions/hea/kuiper/data.html]. In the top left panel, upper limits by ground-based\nobservations are also plotted above 50 GeV.\n\n3.4. Radiation spectrum\nLet us finally examine the radiation spectrum. From\nfigure 8, we adopt \u03b6obs=125o as an appropriate value\nto obtain the phase-resolved spectrum as presented in\nfigure 9. It follows that the predicted spectrum is\nroughly consistent with observations. At P1 (in pulse\nphase 40.4o-76.4o, central panel), absorption\nsuppress the flux above 50 MeV, as we can see from\nthe un-absorbed primary flux (black thin solid curve)\nand the final flux to be observed (red thick solid\ncurve). This is because most of the photons are\nemitted near the light cylinder (\u03c0 ~0.8\u03c0LC) and hence\nhave large 3-D collision angles (>0.2 rad) with the\nstrong magnetosphereic X-ray photons owing to the\ncurving up field lines towards the rotation axis. In\n\nother pulse phases, absorption becomes important\ntypically above a few GeV. At P2 (177.2o-216.8o,\nbottom center), the synchro-curvature photons emitted\nfrom the primaries in a residual, small-amplitude E||\nregion (see the region \u03c6 *~-2 rad in fig. 5) is less\nsufficient, resulting in the insufficient flux around 10\nMeV. The off-pulse emission (249.2o-18.8o) appears to\nbe small from the pulse profile (fig. 8) but not\nnegligible in the phase-resolved spectrum (fig. 9). This\nis because outward photons appear after P2 being\nemitted close to or beyond the light cylinder by\ncurvature radiation and ICS of the magnetospheric IR\nphotons (Aharonian & Bogovalov 2003), and because\ninward photons appear around phase 20o (for \u03b6obs\n~120o) being emitted from the south-pole OG. The ICS\nphotons are also emitted in other phases; however, they\n\n\f-9-\n\nare totally absorbed by the same IR photon field to\nappear as the secondary synchrotron component\nbetween 100 MeV and 100 GeV, which is negligibly\nsmall compared with the primary curvature flux.\nSince E|| is substantially screened by the produced\npairs in the inner part of the OG (e.g., at s<0.5 \u03c0LC),\nthe outward emission from the north-pole OG does\nnot contribute for the bridge (112.4o-152.0o, top\ncenter) very much. Instead, the inward emission from\nthe south-pole OG contributes to the bridge flux to\nsome extent. The data points are from Harnden &\nSeward (1984), Pravdo & Serlemitsos (1981),\nKnight (1982), Weisskopf et al. (2004), and\nMineo et al. (2006) for X-rays; from Nolan et al.\n(1993), Ulmer et al. (1995), Much et al. (1995),\nFierro et al. (1998), Kuiper et al. (2001) for\n10~MeV-20GeV; from Borione et al. (1997),\nTanimori et al. (1998), Hillas et al. (1998),\nLessard et al. (2000), and de Naurois et al.\n(2002) for the upper limits above 50 GeV.\n\n4. Slot-gap model\nWe apply the same numerical scheme described in\nsections 2 and 3 to the SG model. In section 4.1, we\nbriefly review how the SG is formed in the PC region.\nSince nobody has independently re-examined the SG\nmodel so far, we first check the SG model (MH04;\nMH04; HSDF08) by our code in sections 4.2-4.3.\n\nThus, it had been considered that a PC accelerator is\nnon-active along the polar field lines curved away from\nthe rotation axis, localizing in the vicinity of the NS\nsurface (Arons 1983).\nSubsequently, MT92 pointed out that an energetic PC\naccelerator can exist also along away-curvature field\nlines due to general relativistic (GR) effects, because\n\u03c1GJ/B deviates from the Newtonian value due to the \u03a9\u03c9 factor (instead of \u03a9) in the right-hand side of\nequation (9), as indicated by the black thick solid curve\nin fig. 10. Since the SCLF has \u03c1/(\u03a9B/2\u03c0c) as indicated\nby the red thick solid curve for this revised PC model, a\nnegative-definite \u03c1eff, which ensures a negative-definite\nE||, extends up to a greater altitude than the Newtonian\ncase. Thus, a PC accelerator exists within the altitude\ncomparable to the NS radius for a rapidly rotating NS\nas in the Crab pulsar system. The resulting potential\ndrop is found be enough to reproduce high energy\nemissions (for details, see MH03 and references\ntherein).\nIn spite of these attractive features on energetics, the\nGR-PC accelerator is still localized within a few stellar\nradii even for millisecond pulsars. Thus, the solid angle\nis too small to reproduce the wide pulsed profiles that\nare observed. They were, therefore, motivated by the\nneed to contrive a higher altitude emission model.\n\n4.1. Formation of a slot gap in polar cap region\nFor a parallel rotator, \u03a9i B > 0 , in a PC spacecharge-limited flow (SCLF) model, electrons are\nextracted at a slightly smaller rate (in an absolute\nvalue sense) than the GJ rate. We may write this\nelectric current density as j=\u03c1c=(1-\u03b4)c\u03c1GJ*, where \u03b4\nis a small positive constant and * denotes that the\nquantity is evaluated at the NS surface. Provided that\nthe magnetosphere is stationary in the co-rotating\nframe and that pair production does not take place,\nj/B\u221d\u03c1/(\u03a9B/(2\u03c0c) conserves along the field line, as\nindicated by the green dotted line in figure 10. On the\nother hand, along the magnetic field lines curving\naway from the rotation axis, the Newtonian GJ\ncharge density per magnetic flux tube, \u03c1GJ/(\u03a9B/(2\u03c0c)\n=-B\u03b6/B, where B\u03b6 denotes the magnetic component\nprojected along the rotation axis, increases outwards,\nas indicated by the black thin dashed line. Thus, at\nthe altitude much less than the stellar radius,\n\u03c1eff \u2261\u03c1GJ\u2212\u03c1 changes sign from negative to positive\noutwards, leading to a sign reversal of E|| from\nnegative to positive, thereby terminating the gap.\n(Exactly speaking, the place where E|| changes sign\ndepends not only on the sign of \u03c1eff but also on the\ntrans-field structure; nevertheless, this argument of\ngap termination is qualitatively correct in any case.)\n\nFig. (10). Charge density per magnetic flux tube along\nthe field line curved away from the rotation axis. The\nblack solid curve denotes the Goldreich-Julian charge\ndensity (i.e., eq.[9]) for a dipole magnetic field with GR\ncorrections, while the black dashed one the Newtonian\nvalue. The rotational frequency, radius, and magnetic\ninclination of the NS are 33 ms, 10km, and 60o,\nrespectively. The magnetic field line is selected to be\nthe last-open field line that cross the NS surface at \u03c6 *=0.\nThe green thin solid curve (bottom left corner) denotes\nthe real charge density for Newtonian PC model, while\nthe red thick solid one for the PC model with GR\ncorrections.\n\n\f- 10 -\n\nDeveloping the idea that the pair formation front\n(PFF), above which E|| is screened, occurs at\nincreasingly higher altitude as the magnetic colatitude\napproaches the last-open field line where E|| vanishes\n(Arons & Scharlemann 1979), MH03 first\ninvestigated a self-consistent electrodynamics of the\nSG, a narrow space between PFF (upper boundary)\nand the last-open field line (lower boundary), and\nfound that E|| is greatly reduced by the proximity of\nthe two conducting boundaries.\n\n4.2 Lower-altitude solution\nWe re-examine the SG model of MH03 by applying\nour numerical code. MH03 demonstrated that the PFF\nbecomes almost parallel to the NS surface in the\ncentral part of the PC (i.e., near the magnetic axis)\nand that the PFF rapidly curves up to become almost\nparallel to the last-open field line above several per\ncent of r* for a rapidly rotating, highly magnetized\nNS. We confirmed their results by our code as\nindicated by figure 11, which presents the height, hm,\nof the PFF measured in meridional direction from the\nlast-open field line as a function of s and \u03c6 *. It is also\nconfirmed that the potential drop (fig. 12) is\nconsistent with MH03 (see their eq. [22]), being\n~1.5\u00d71012V along the field lines threading the higheraltitude SG (e.g., at h=0.02, see next subsection for\ndetails on the high-altitude SG). Close to the star, the\nSG structure is found to be almost independent of \u03c6 *.\nThe electrons are accelerated up to the Lorentz factor\nof ~3\u00d7106 at s~0.08r*.\n\n4.3 Higher-altitude solution\nThe SG solution described just above exists only\nwithin the region in which \u03c1eff=\u03c1GJ-\u03c1 <0 holds to\nguarantee a negative-definite E|| throughout the gap.\nTherefore, if \u03c1/B is conserved along the field line (as\nindicated by the horizontal red solid line in fig. 10),\nthe pair-free SG extends only up to the altitude 1.3 r*\nin the case of the Crab pulsar. However, if the SG\nextends only up to such an altitude, the problem of\nthe small emission solid angle occurs in the same\nway as in PC models. Thus, MH04 examined the\npossibility of an extension of the SG into the higher\naltitudes. However, unlike the OG solution, the\nhigher-altitude SG model cannot be constructed\nwithout additional assumptions. We thus describe\nthem in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2, then turn to a reexamination of the high-altitude SG model of MH04\nand HSDF08 in sections 4.3.3 and 4.3.4.\n\n4.3.1 Additional assumption: real charge density\nTo extend the SG into the higher altitudes, MH04\nassumed that \u03c1/B increased with increasing s, as\nindicated by the red solid curve in figure 13. Their\n\nrationale is that the SG physical thickness is less than\n0.4r* even at the light cylinder (for \u0394\u03beSG=hm~0.04 in\ntheir notation) and that the cross-field motion of\ncharges would supply enough positive charges that\nrealizes the outward increase of \u03c1/B in this thin gap\n(e.g., Luo & Melrose 2007 for trapping of relativistic\nplasmas in the closed zone). However, this is,\nunfortunately, not the case. For example, the Newtonian\ndipole field geometry,\nsin 2 (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b1 ) sin 2 \u03b8* ,\n=\nr\nr*\n\n(26)\n\ngives the gap physical thickness rd\u03b8 =2.3(hm/0.04)r* at\nr=0.5\u03c0LC and 6.4(hm/0.04)r* at r=\u03c0LC for \u03c0LC=160r*\n(i.e., for the Crab pulsar). For cross-field motion to\neffectively work, the thickness should less than 0.05r*\n(see section 4.5 in H07); therefore, it is difficult to\njustify the \u03c1/B variation (red solid curve) with crossfield motion, provided that hm>0.001.\nOn these grounds, we abandon to physically justify the\n\u03c1/B variation and simply follow the assumption made\nby equations (28)-(30) in MH04, which ensures the\nnegativity of \u03c1eff=\u03c1GJ-\u03c1, and hence E||, from the PC\nregion to the higher altitudes. In our notation, it is\nequivalent with adopting (eq.[38] in MH04)\n\n\u03c1eff\nB\n\n=\u2212\n\n\u23a4\nr*3 \u239e\n\u03a9 \u23aa\u23a7 \u23a1 \u239b\n\u23a8\u23a2\u03ba \u239c \u03b2 \u2212 3 \u239f + 1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u23a5 cos \u03b1\n\u03c0 LC \u23a0\n2\u03c0 c \u23aa\u23a9 \u23a3 \u239d\n\u23a6\n\n\u23ab\u23aa\n\u23a1 H (\u03c0 LC ) \u03c0 LC f (r* )\n\u23a4\n3\n+ H (r* )\u03b8*max \u23a2\n\u2212 \u03b2 \u23a5 sin \u03b1 cos \u03c6* \u23ac ,\n2\n\u23aa\u23ad\n\u23a3 H (r* ) r* f (\u03c0 LC )\n\u23a6\n(27)\nwhere \u03ba~0.15 describes the space-time dragging effect,\n\u03b2, H, f are close to unity, \u03b2=(1-3r/4\u03c0LC)1/2, H(r)~10.1x\u22120.026x2-0.075x3+0.019x4,\nf(r)~1+0.3x+0.096x2,\nwith x= r*/r.\n\nFig. (11) PFF height, hm on the last-open field line\nsurface in the lower-altitude SG model.

The pair-free\nassumption of the SG model would conserve the\nvalue of \u03c1/(\u03a9B/2\u03c0c) as the red dashed line. However,\nto extend a negative E|| to the higher altitudes,\n\u03c1/(\u03a9B/2\u03c0c) is artificially assumed to vary as the red\nsolid line in the high-altitude SG model. For explicit\nfunctional form of \u03c1eff/B=(\u03c1GJ-\u03c1)/B, see eq. (27).\n\n4.3.2 Additional assumption: trans-field thickness\nNext, let us discuss how the pair-free assumption\nconstrains the co-latitudinal thickness, hm. It is clear\nthat there is always a small inward flux of produced\npositrons in the SG, because they cannot escape from\nthe SG by cross field motion provided that hm>0.001.\nSuch inward-migrating positrons emit curvature\nphotons, which cascade into copious pairs in the\ninner magnetosphere (exponentially with the distance\nalong the field lines). If the produced pairs become a\nnon-negligible fraction of the primary electrons\nextracted from the NS surface, the pair-free\nassumption breaks down. Thus, in this paper, we\ndefine hm of the higher-altitude SG, by imposing that\nthe electric current carried by the produced pairs does\nnot exceed 10% of the primary electron current, c\u03c1GJ,\nalong each field line. Note that this constraint on hm\ncould not be obtained if we only considered the\n\nUnder this assumption, the hm distribution on the lastopen field line bundle (i.e., s-\u03c6 * plane) becomes as\npresent in figure 14. If hm increases from the value at\nsome point, the increased pair production could be\ncompensated by the decrease of hm at another point\nalong the same field line. (Therefore, the 'solved' hm in\nfig. 14 is not unique.) However, since E|| is proportional\nto hm2, the cascaded pairs rapidly increase with\nincreasing hm. Thus, the hm(s, \u03c6 *) presented in figure\n14 gives a good estimate of the upper bound for the SG\nto be pair-free. In another word, the electric potential\ndrop along each field line cannot become very large\ncompared with the value derived from the hm presented\nin figure 14.\n\nFig. (14) SG trans-field thickness, hm, on the last-open\nfield line surface. The red solid curve represents the\nposition of the null surface.\n\nNote that the gap thickness, hm, is constrained by no\nmeans from the first principles. It is only artificially\nimposed so that the SG may be pair-free. It is also\nnoteworthy that hm in the higher altitudes (fig. 14) is\nless than the minimum PFF height hm (~0.017) solved\nin the lower altitudes (fig. 11). In the lower altitudes,\ncascaded pairs above the PFF have outward momenta\nand hence migrate outwards to screen E|| at higher\naltitudes than the PFF. Thus, it seems reasonable to\nsuppose that hm in the higher altitudes cannot exceed\nthe value constrained in the lower altitudes.\nInterestingly, the derived hm (fig. 14) is coincidentally\nless than or comparable to 0.017, even though we do\nnot artificially set the upper limit of hm from the loweraltitude value. Along the field lines threading the NS\nsurface in |\u03c6 *| > 1.5 rad, \u03c1eff becomes positive by\nequation (27); thus, the SG does not exist in the higher\naltitudes for this azimuthal range, as indicated by the\nvanishing gap thickness (i.e., black color) in figure 14.\n\n4.3.3 Potential drop\nAs demonstrated by MH04, the lower-altitude solution\n(relatively) smoothly match the higher-altitude solution\n\n\f- 12 -\n\nat s~1.2r* for the Crab pulsar. Thus, we assume that\nthe higher altitude solution starts from 1.2r* and the\nelectrons are injected with the initial outward\nmomenta determined by the potential drop obtained\nin the lower-altitude SG solution (fig. 11). Adopting\nthe assumption described in sections 4.3.1 and 4.3.2,\nand applying the same numerical code to the higheraltitude SG model, we solve E||, particle distribution\nfunctions, and the photon specific intensity. It follows\nfrom figure 15 that a strong E|| appears only in the\nouter-most portions of the SG; therefore, most of the\npotential drop and hence emission occurs near the\nlight cylinder.\nThe potential drop in the higher-altitude SG is\npresented in figure 16. It shows that the potential\ndrop attains only 2\u00d71012 V, which is less than 1/5 of\nHSDF08 prediction, because hm is constrained to be\nless than half of their estimate (~0.04) due to the pairfree condition.\n\nFig. (15) Acceleration field [V/m] distribution on the\nlast-open field line surface in the higher-altitude SG\nmodel. The solid curve represents the null surface\nposition.\n\n4.3.4 Emission from the SG\nUsing the higher-altitude SG solution, we map the\nphoton intensity as a function of the pulse phase \u03a6\nand the observer's viewing angle \u03b6obs in figure 17.\nThe red ring around the north pole (at \u03b6obs=60o and\n\u03a6 =0o) indicates that photons are efficiently emitted\nfrom relatively lower altitudes (say, s<0.1\u03c0LC) when\nelectrons lose their initial energy gained in the loweraltitude SG (s<1.2r*). Because E|| is weak in the\nmiddle altitudes, caustic emission is negligibly small.\n(For example, electrons' Lorentz factors attain only\n6\u00d7106 at s~0.6\u03c0LC.) However, in the outer-most part\nof the SG (e.g., s>0.7\u03c0LC), relatively strong E||\n(~3\u00d7106V m-1) leads to the emission represented by\nthe cyan arc around \u03b6obs~150o and -110o<\u03a6 <20o).\n\nFig. (16) Electric potential drop [V] along the field line\nthreading the NS at colatitude h and azimuth \u03c6 * in the\nhigher-altitude SG model.\n\nIf we superpose the south-pole SG emissions and\nspecify \u03b6obs, we obtain the pulse profile as presented\nin figure 18. It follows from the ordinate values in\neach panel that the photon flux above 90 MeV is a\nfew orders magnitude less than the OG prediction (fig.\n8). The strong intensity appearing around \u03a6~0o\nrepresents the photons emitted relatively close (r\n<0.1\u03c0LC) to the south pole.\nTo calculate the spectrum, we adopt \u03b6obs=60o (or\nequivalently 120o), because the photon mapping\nresult (fig. 17) shows that the photon intensity\nmaximizes at this viewing angle. Figure 19\ndemonstrates that the predicted flux of the SG\nemission is negligible from IR to VHE. This is solely\nbecause the SG thickness, hm, is severely constrained\nby the pair-free condition, which has not been\nconsidered in any previous SG models.\n\nFig. (17) Photon mapping results on the phase diagram\nin the higher-altitude SG model. The reddened regions\nindicate strong photon intensity. Only the photons\nemitted from the north-pole SG and having energies\ngreater than 90 MeV are plotted.\n\n\f- 13 -\n\nFig. (18) Pulse profile for four different viewing\nangles, \u03b6obs, in the higher-altitude SG model. Note\nthat the typical ordinate values (~10-10) are 103 times\nless than those in figure 8 (~10-7).\n\nwhich adopt the acceleration electric field solved in a\nvacuum gap while assume non-vacuum plasma density\nto compute emissions. If we additionally specify the\ndistance and the observer's viewing angle, we can\npredict the pulse profiles and the phase-resolved spectra\nof arbitrary pulsars. We apply the scheme to the Crab\npulsar and obtain consistent results with observations\n(at least qualitatively). We also apply the same\nnumerical scheme to the SG model, introducing an\nadditional assumption on the real charge density and\nfind that the SG model can predict at most 0.1 % of the\nobserved gamma-ray flux, because its trans-field\nthickness is severely limited due to the pair-free\ncondition, which is necessary not to violate the spacecharge-limited flow assumption in the lower altitudes.\n\n5.1. Similarities between vacuum OG model and\npair-free SG model\nIt is demonstrated in section 3.2 in H06 that a 2-D OG\nhas the produced electric current that is less than the\nGoldreich-Julian value if hm<0.047 and that the\npredicted \u03b3-ray luminosity is less than 1% of the superGJ solutions (fig. 8 in H06). This conclusion is\nunchanged in the present 3-D analysis, except that hm\nvaries as a function of s and \u03c6 *.\n\nFig. (19) Higher-altitude SG prediction of the phaseaveraged spectrum of the Crab pulsar for \u03b6obs=60o.\nFlux is negligible above 100 MeV. Lower-altitude\nSG emission, which is due to the synchrotron process\nfrom the cascaded pairs above the polar-cap PFF and\nbecomes important below 10 MeV, is not depicted to\nclarify the higher-altitude SG component.\n\n5 Discussion\nTo sum up, we have examined the electrodynamic\nstructure of particle accelerators in a 3-D pulsar\nmagnetosphere, by solving the set of Maxwell and\nBoltzmann equations. The accelerator (or the gap)\ncan be solved, if we specify the following four\nparameters: pulsar period, period derivative (or the\nmagnetic dipole moment), magnetic inclination angle,\nand the NS surface temperature, without introducing\nany artificial assumptions. The obtained solution\n(coincidentally) corresponds to a quantitative\nextension of previous phenomenological OG models,\n\nThe situation is similar for the SG model. That is, if we\nimpose a pair-free condition, we have to adopt hm<0.02\nin most portion of the SG. The allowed hm becomes less\nthan half of the limit (0.047) for an OG to be nearly\nvacuum, because the SG has electrons extracted from\nthe NS surface at the GJ rate. These outgoing electrons\nincrease the \u03b3-\u03b3 pair production between the outwardly\npropagating curvature photons and the surface thermal\nX-rays compared with the nearly vacuum (i.e., sub-GJ)\nOG case, which has a much smaller outward particle\nflux. Since the produced positrons return to emit\ncopious curvature \u03b3-rays inwards, the increased pair\nproduction in the higher-altitude SG significantly\nsuppresses hm compared to a nearly vacuum OG. Thus,\nthe predicted SG \u03b3-ray flux becomes even smaller than\nthe nearly vacuum OG case (left panel of fig. 8 in H06).\nIn short, neither the vacuum OG model nor the pair-free\nSG model can explain the observed \u03b3-ray flux. We must\nconsider copious pair production in the gap, which\nallows much greater hm. In this paper, we naturally\nobtain this kind of solution from the set of Maxwell and\nBoltzmann equations under appropriate boundary\nconditions.\n\n5.2. Assumed real charge density in SG model\nLet us briefly discuss how the results change if we\nadopt another real charge density in the higher-altitude\nSG model, instead of equation (27). If we adopt a larger\n(or a smaller) |\u03c1eff| than equation (27), the enhanced (or\n\n\f- 14 -\n\nreduced) E|| results in a smaller (or larger) hm such\nthat the SG is kept pair-free. As a result, it turns out\nthat the potential drop, and hence the photon flux,\nlittle depends on the assumed strength of |\u03c1eff|. This\nkind of negative feedback effect has been, in fact,\nwell-known in OG theories (section 4.2 in H06). On\nthese grounds, we may consider that the OG and the\nSG (and even the PC) models are essentially the same,\nbeing derived from the same set of basic equations\nwith slightly different boundary conditions (and\nadditional assumptions in the case of the SG model).\nOnly human may be trying to discriminate them.\n\n5.3. Source of pulsar winds\nIn the solution that quantifies the OG model (section\n3), the pair production rate in the entire\nmagnetosphere is found to be ~5\u00d71038 s-1. This value\nis less than the constraints that arise from\nconsideration of magnetic dissipation in the wind\nzone ~1040 s-1 (Kirk & Skjaeraasen 2003) and of\nCrab nebula's radio synchrotron emission 3\u00d71040 s-1\n(Arons 2004). It is likely that any OG model cannot\nexplain such a large production rate of electronpositron pairs with outward initial momenta. (If they\nare produced inwardly with typical Lorentz factor of\n~103, they cannot return outwards, by e.g., radiation\npressure from the NS surface.) Thus, it is possible\nthat most of the wind particles are produced (in the\nlower altitudes) above the PFF of a PC accelerator,\nwhich is located near the magnetic pole and does not\nexist on the same field lines as the OG resides. It is\nstill an unsettled question how the PC and OG\naccelerators co-exist in the magnetosphere with the\nelectric current determined by global conditions (e.g.,\nMestel & Shibata 1994; Spitkovsky 2006).\n\n5.4. Application to other pulsars\nIn the present paper, we have concentrated on the\nelectrodynamics of the two representative pulsar\nhigh-energy emission theories, OG and SG models,\nfocusing on the application to the Crab pulsar,\nbecause we consider that theoretical consistency is\nmore important than comparison with observations.\nNevertheless, since we have developed the scheme as\ngeneral as possible, the same numerical code can be\napplied to other rotation-powered pulsars without any\nmodifications. In subsequent papers, we will present\nmore results on other young pulsars, as well as on\nmiddle-aged, millisecond, and possible radio pulsars,\nto explain the data obtained by e.g., ROSAT,\nChandra, XMM, ASCA, BeppoSAX, CGRO, AGILE\nand to predict potential pulsars for GLAST and\nMAGIC observations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nSpecial thanks are due to Dr. A.
