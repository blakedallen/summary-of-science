An important class of such procedures is based on introduction of various metrics on the space information\nstrings, see e.g. [5]. A metric with new interesting features was recently used in theoretical physics (from string\ntheory to theory of disordered systems, spin glasses), see e.g. [6], [7], [8], [9] in cognitive science, psychology\nand image analysis [10]. This is so called p\u2013adic metric (in fact, a class of metrics depending on the parameter\np - a prime number). The main distinguishing feature of this metric is its sensitivity to hierarchic patterns in\ninformation having a special structure matching with p\u2013adic encoding of information.1\nA few years ago 2\u2013adic metric was applied to study the problem of degeneration of the genetic code, see\n[11, 12, 13]. These p\u2013adic models can be considered as new development in the approach to investigation of the\nstructure of the genetic code from the point of view of coding theory, see [14, 15, 16].\nIn the present paper we discuss the structure of the PAM matrix used in bioinformatics (see for example\n[1]) from the point of view of p\u2013adic analysis. We use the 2\u2013adic parametrization of the genetic (amino acid)\ncode obtained in [11] (see also [12] for the different p\u2013adic parametrization).\nIn [11, 12] it was shown that, after some special parametrization of the space of codons (triples of nucleotides)\nthe genetic code becomes a locally constant map of p\u2013adic argument. Moreover, the degeneracy of the genetic\ncode in this language takes the form of local constancy of the corresponding mapping.\nLet us also mention the application of the p\u2013adic parametrization to the description of the Parisi matrix\nfrom the replica symmetry breaking approach to spin glasses [17, 18]. After the p\u2013adic parametrization of the\nnumbers of the lines and the columns the Parisi matrix becomes a locally constant block matrix.\nIt is natural to check, using the p\u2013adic parametrization approach, the structure of the PAM matrix. The\nPAM matrix is used in bioinformatics for sequence alignment and is constructed using a Markov chain model\nof point mutations for a protein chain.\n\u2217 International Center for Mathematical Modelling in Physics and Cognitive Sciences, University of V\u00e4xj\u00f6, S-35195, Sweden,\ne\u2013mail: Andrei.Khrennikov@vxu.se\n\u2020 Steklov Mathematical Institute, Moscow, Russia, e\u2013mail: kozyrev@mi.ras.ru\n1 We remark that to appeal to hierarchical structures is quite common in genetics and bioinformatics in general, see, e.g. [3], [4].\nOur main contribution is combining the hierarchic structure approach with number theory.\n\n1\n\n\fWe assume that the structure of the PAM matrix has some relation to the structure of the genetic code.\nUsing this idea we enumerate the lines and the columns of the PAM matrix using the 2\u2013adic parametrization of\nthe genetic code. After this parametrization the PAM matrix becomes more regular, namely, the dependence\nof the matrix elements Aij of the PAM matrix on the indices i and j is close to locally constant with respect to\nthe 2\u2013adic norm for the majority of matrix elements.\nWe have some exceptions from this rule. It is easy to see that these exceptions are related to several amino\nacids, namely to Y, W, C, F, L. In order to describe this deviations from 2\u2013adicity we introduce the following\nconstruction: we expand (by hands) the PAM matrix into the sum of the two matrices\nA = A(2) + A(\u221e) .\nThe matrix in this expansion A(2) is 2\u2013adically regular (close to locally constant). The matrix A(\u221e) is sparse\n(the majority of matrix elements are zero, non zero matrix elements are mainly concentrated of the lines and\ncolumns related to the amino acids Y, W, C, F, L).\nOne can see that the deviations from 2\u2013adicity (i.e. non\u2013zero matrix elements of A(\u221e) ) are related to amino\nacids which are in some sense special - to the aromatic amino acids Y, W, F, and to Cysteine C which contains\nthe SH group.\nWe also mention that the 2\u2013adic structure of the genetic code is related to some chemical properties of the\namino acids. In particular, hydrophobic amino acids are clustered in two ball with respect to the 2\u2013adic norm.\nTherefore the 2\u2013adic parametrization allows to separate the impact of the chemical and geometrical properties\nof aromatic amino acids for the structure of the PAM matrix.\nThe structure of the present paper is the following.\nIn Section 2 we discuss some family of ultrametric spaces.\nIn Section 3 we describe the 2\u2013adic 2\u2013dimensional parametrization of the genetic code of [11].\nIn Section 4 we put the PAM250 matrix.\nIn Section 5 we describe the reshuffling of the lines and the columns of the PAM matrix, corresponding to\nthe 2\u2013adic parametrization of the genetic code of Section 2.\nIn Section 6 we introduce the expansion of the PAM matrix into the sum of the two matrices, one of which\nis 2\u2013adically regular (close to locally constant) and the other is sparse (majority of matrix elements are equal\nto zero).\nSections 7 and 8 are appendices where the definitions of PAM matrices and the eucaryotic genetic code are\nexposed.\n\n2\n\nUltrametric spaces\n\nAn ultrametric space is a metric space where the metric d(x, y) satisfies the strong triangle inequality:\nd(x, y) \u2264 max (d(x, z), d(y, z)) ,\n\n\u2200x, y, z.\n\nThe strong triangle inequality can be stated geometrically: each side of a triangle is at most as long as the\nlongest one of the two other sides. Such a triangle is quite restricted when considered in the ordinary Euclidean\nspace - it is isosceles, i.e., d(x, y) = d(y, z) or d(x, z) = d(y, z) or d(x, y) = d(z, x).\nAn ultrametric space is a natural mathematical object for description of a hierarchical system. On ultrametric\nspaces there exist many locally constant functions, i.e., functions which are constant on some vicinity of any\npoint, but not necessarily constant on the whole space. In particular, we show that the genetic code can be\nconsidered as a locally constant map on a specially designed ultrametric space, so called 2-adic plane, see [11].\nLet (X, d) be an ultrametric space. We consider balls Ur (a) = {x \u2208 X : d(x, a) \u2264 r}, r > 0, x \u2208 X. So, a is\nthe center of the ball Ur (a) having radius r. We mention a few unusual (from the viewpoint of usual Euclidean\ngeometry) properties of ultrametric balls:\na). Each point of Ur (a) can be chosen as its center. So, inside a ball all points have \"equal rights\".\nb). Any two balls either do not intersect or one of the balls contains the other ball. In this framework,\nclustering into disjoint balls is a very natural operation.\n\n2\n\n\fWe remark that ultrametric spaces were widely used in bioinformatics, see [1, 2]. However, in this paper we\nplan to elaborate new applications of ultrametric spaces to biology (genetics) which are different from mentioned\nones.\nWe are interested in the following special class of ultrametric spaces (X, d). Every point x is the infinite\nsequence of digits\nx = (\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n , . . . ) .\n(1)\nEach digit yields the finite number of values,\n\u03b1i \u2208 Am = {0, . . . , m \u2212 1},\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m > 1 is a natural number, the base of the alphabet Am .\nIf the sequence x = (\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n , . . . ) contains only finite number of non-zero terms (\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ), then\nwe can consider x as the natural number\nn\nX\n\u03b1i mi .\n(3)\nx=\ni=0\n\nMoreover, this formula defines the one to one correspondence between natural numbers (with zero) and the\nspace of final sequences x = (\u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n ).\nWe denote the space of sequences (1), (2) by the symbol Zm . Ultrametric is introduced on this set in the\nfollowing way. For two points\nx = (\u03b10 , \u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n , . . . ),\n\ny = (\u03b20 , \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . , \u03b2n , . . . ),\n\nwe set\n\n1\nif \u03b1j = \u03b2j , j = 0, 1, . . . , k \u2212 1, and \u03b1k 6= \u03b2k .\nmk\nThe ultrametric space (X = Zm , d = dm ) is called the space of m-adic integers.\nThe ultrametric dm describes the following hierarchical structure. If x = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n , . . . ), \u03b1j =\n0, 1, . . . , m \u2212 1, is a vector encoding information on some object, then digits \u03b1j have different weights. The digit\n\u03b10 is the most important, \u03b11 dominates over \u03b12 , . . . , \u03b1n , . . . , and so on. Such hierarchic information vectors\ncan be created by living systems, e.g., by the brain to process information. Applications of m-adic numbers\nto information theory and, in particular, to description of cognitive processes and complex social systems were\ndeveloped in [7, 10, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23].\ndm (x, y) =\n\nIn applications we will use not only \"one dimensional\" m-adic spaces, but also cartesian products of a few\nspaces, e.g., m-adic plane Z2m = Zm \u00d7 Zm and so on. Our aim is to show that 2-adic plane structure was\nembedded in the genetic code, see [11].\nWe remark that m-adic numbers for m = p, where p is a prime number were intensively used (during last\n20 years) in mathematical physics [6, 9]. The number theoretic definition is as follows.\nLet us fix a prime number p > 1. For example, fix p = 2 or fix p = 1999. The example of ultrametric space\nis the field of p-adic numbers Qp , which is the completion of the field of rational numbers with respect to p-adic\nnorm |x|p , defined as follows: for a rational number x = p\u03b3 m\nn , where \u03b3 = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, . . . , and m, n are non-zero\nand are not divisible by p, its p-adic norm is\n|x|p = p\u2212\u03b3 .\np-Adic norm is widely used in number theory and algebraic geometry.\nIf a rational number is divisible by p\u03b3 , where \u03b3 is very large, then its p-adic norm is very small. This\nhierarchy of the degrees of p (i.e. of values of the p\u2013adic norm) gives the hierarchical (ultrametric) structure of\nthe p\u2013adic norm. p-Adic numbers are in one to one correspondence with the series\nx=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nxi pi ,\n\nxi = 0, . . . , p \u2212 1,\n\ni=\u03b3\n\nwhere \u03b3 is integer and x\u03b3 6= 0 (this expansion is the analogue of (3)).\nThe unit ball in Qp with center at a = 0 zero coincides with the space of p-adic integers Zp .\np-Adic numbers were actively used (since pioneer papers of I.Volovich, [24]) in high energy physics (superstring theory, cosmology) and theory of disordered systems (spin glasses), see, e.g., review [9] and the book\n[6].\n3\n\n\f3\n\n2-Adic parametrization of the genetic code\n\nIn the 2\u2013adic parametrization approach of [11] we enumerate in some special way the set of 64 codons (triples\nof nucleotides) by pairs of digits (x, y), x, y = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 7. These digits are in one to one correspondence with\nthe triples (x0 , x1 , x2 ) and (y0 , y1 , y2 ) of 0 and 1 (the expansions of x and y over degrees of 2):\nx = x0 + 2x1 + 4x2 ,\n\ny = y0 + 2y1 + 4y2 ,\n\nxi , yi = 0, 1.\n\n2\u2013Adic norm of x is equal to 2\u2212i , where i is the number of the first non zero xi in the above expansion\n(analogously for y).\nEach pair of digits (xi , yi ) is defined by a nucleotide using the rule\nA\nU\n\nG\n00\n=\nC\n10\n\n01\n.\n11\n\nSince the nucleotides A = (0, 0) and G = (0, 1) are purines, U = (1, 0) and C = (1, 1) are pyrimidines,\nthe different first digits in the above binary representation corresponds to the different chemical types of the\nnucleotides. Namely, the nucleotide (x, y) with x = 0 is a purine, and the nucleotide (x, y) with x = 1 is a\npyrimidine.\nThe second digit y = 0, 1 in the considered parametrization describes the H\u2013bonding character (weak for\ny = 0 and strong for y = 1).\nUsing the above correspondence between the nucleotides and the digits 0 and 1, we introduce the correspondence between the codons (triples of nucleotides) and the triples (x0 , x1 , x2 ) and (y0 , y1 , y2 ) of 0 and 1\n(equivalently, the corresponding x, y = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 7) by the following prescription.\nThe second nucleotide in the codon defines the pair (x0 , y0 ), the first nucleotide in the codon defines the\npair (x1 , y1 ), and the third nucleotide in the codon defines the pair (x2 , y2 ).\nThis rule is related to the following hierarchy of nucleotides in the codon\n2>1>3\ni.e the second nucleotide in the codon is the most important (and the largest in the 2\u2013adic norm) and the third\nnucleotide is the least important.\nAfter that we make the special reshuffling of the values of x and y:\n0, 4, 2, 6, 1, 5, 3, 7 7\u2192 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\nsimilar to made in [17].\nThen we enumerate codons using the described above rule. Namely we put the codons in the table 8 \u00d7 8\nwith the natural 2\u2013adic norm (here the numbers of the lines and columns are x and y defined above):\nAAA\nAAU\nU AA\nU AU\nAU A\nAU U\nUUA\nUUU\n\nAAG GAA\nAAC GAU\nU AG CAA\nU AC CAU\nAU G GU A\nAU C GU U\nU U G CU A\nU U C CU U\n\nGAG AGA\nGAC AGU\nCAG U GA\nCAC U GU\nGU G ACA\nGU C ACU\nCU G U CA\nCU C U CU\n\nAGG\nAGC\nU GG\nU GC\nACG\nACC\nU CG\nU CC\n\nGGA\nGGU\nCGA\nCGU\nGCA\nGCU\nCCA\nCCU\n\nGGG\nGGC\nCGG\nCGC\nGCG\nGCC\nCCG\nCCC\n\nThe 2 \u00d7 2 quadrates here are 2\u2013dimensional 2\u2013adic balls (or clusters) of the diameter 1/4.\nAfter application of the eucaryotic genetic (amino acid) code (described in the Appendix) to the above table\n\n4\n\n\fwe get the table of amino acids on the 2\u2013adic plane\nK\nN\nTer\nY\nI|M\nI\nL\nF\n\nE\nD\nQ\nH\n\nR\nS\nTer|W\nC\n\nV\n\nT\n\nA\n\nL\n\nS\n\nP\n\nG\nR\n\nwhere Ter is the stop codon. Each square in the above table is the 2 by 2 square in the 2-adic plane of codons.\nIn particular, the genetic code map acts as follows on the 2\u2013adic balls\nAAA\nAAU\n\nK\nAAG\n\u2192\n,\nAAC\nN\n\nCCA\nCCU\n\nCCG\n\u2192 P\nCCC\n\nHere we use the standard notations for the nucleotides A, U, G, C and the amino acids.\nWe see, that the degeneracy of the genetic code in the above 2-adic parametrization is described by the\n2-adic proximity - the codons which encode the same amino acid are 2-adically close. Moreover, the domains\nwith the different degeneracy are symmetric at the 2-adic plane - the lower right half of the plane is occupied\nby amino acids with the degeneracy four, and the upper left half of the plane contains the amino acids with the\ndegeneracy mainly equal to two. We also have the five cases of additional degeneracy which is not described by\nthe 2-adic parametrization.\nThe described here 2-adic 2-dimensional parametrization of the genetic code is related to physical\u2013chemical\nproperties of the amino acids. Namely, the hydrophobic amino acids are clustered in the following two 2-adic\nballs in the 2-adic plane:\n\nTer|W\nC\nI|M\nI\nL\nF\n\nV\nL\n\nHere the hydrophobic amino acids are listed according to the book [25].\nUsing the 2-adic parametrization of the genetic code we can divide all the set of amino acid in the groups\n{K, N, E, D, Y, Q, H}, {R, G, W, C}, {I, M, V, L, F}, {T, A, S, P}. These groups are the images with respect\nto the map of the genetic code of the four quadrants (2\u2013adic balls of the diameter 1/2) of the 2\u2013adic plane of\ncodons.\n\n4\n\nThe PAM matrix\n\nThe following table describes the PAM250 matrix:\n\n5\n\n\f\u2217\nA\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nK\nA= L\nM\nN\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nV\nW\nY\n\nA C\nD\nE\nF\nG\n2 \u22122 0\n0 \u22124 1\n\u2217 12 \u22125 \u22125 \u22124 \u22123\n\u2217\n\u2217\n4\n3 \u22126 1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n4 \u22125 0\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n9 \u22125\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n5\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nH\n\u22121\n\u22123\n1\n1\n\u22122\n\u22122\n6\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nI\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22122\n1\n\u22123\n\u22122\n5\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nK\n\u22121\n\u22125\n0\n0\n\u22125\n\u22122\n0\n\u22122\n5\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nL\n\u22122\n\u22126\n\u22124\n\u22123\n2\n\u22124\n\u22122\n2\n\u22123\n6\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nM\n\u22121\n\u22125\n\u22123\n\u22122\n0\n\u22123\n\u22122\n2\n0\n4\n6\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nN\n0\n\u22124\n2\n1\n\u22124\n0\n2\n\u22122\n1\n\u22123\n\u22122\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nP\n1\n\u22123\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22125\n\u22121\n0\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22121\n6\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nQ\n0\n\u22125\n2\n2\n\u22125\n\u22121\n3\n\u22122\n1\n\u22122\n\u22121\n1\n0\n4\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nR\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22124\n\u22123\n2\n\u22122\n3\n\u22123\n0\n0\n0\n1\n6\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nS\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\u22123\n1\n\u22121\n\u22121\n0\n\u22123\n\u22122\n1\n1\n\u22121\n0\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nT\n1\n\u22122\n0\n0\n\u22123\n0\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n0\n\u22121\n\u22121\n1\n3\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nV\n0\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22122\n4\n\u22122\n2\n2\n\u22122\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22121\n0\n4\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\nW\n\u22126\n\u22128\n\u22127\n\u22127\n0\n\u22127\n\u22123\n\u22125\n\u22123\n\u22122\n\u22124\n\u22124\n\u22126\n\u22125\n2\n\u22122\n\u22125\n\u22126\n17\n\u2217\n\nY\n\u22123\n0\n\u22124\n\u22124\n7\n\u22125\n0\n\u22121\n\u22124\n\u22121\n\u22122\n\u22122\n\u22125\n\u22124\n\u22124\n\u22123\n\u22123\n\u22122\n0\n10\n\nBecause the matrix A is symmetrical we put only the half of matrix elements.

These four groups correspond to the second nucleotide in the codons which encode (through\nthe amino acid genetic code) amino acids in the corresponding group. Namely, the first group correspond to the\ncodons with A (Adenine) at the second position, the second group correspond to the codons with G (Guanine),\nthe third group correspond to the codons with U (Uracil), and the fourth group correspond to the codons with\nC (Cytosine).\nCompared to the PAM matrix from the previous Section, this reshuffled matrix is more regular. It has large\npositive matrix elements at the main diagonal, and off diagonal terms are close to block constant at least at\nsome of the 16 blocks, corresponding to matrix elements with the indices from one of the 4 groups of amino\nacids.\nIn particular, in the block corresponding to the matrix elements Aij , i, j \u2208 {T, A, S, P}, all off diagonal\nmatrix elements are equal to 1 (10 matrix elements) or 0 (2 matrix elements).\nIn the block Aij , i \u2208 {K, N, E, D, Y, Q, H}, j \u2208 {T, A, S, P} we have matrix elements equal to 0 (13 matrix\nelements), \u22121 (10 matrix elements), 1 (1 matrix element) and anomalous matrix elements equal to \u22123 and \u22125\ncorresponding to the amino acid Y. The analogous situation we will have in the other blocks of the matrix A.\nWe arrive to the following picture: the PAM matrix A will be a block matrix with matrix elements close to\nlocally constant (i.e. constant in the 16 blocks) if we will exclude matrix elements corresponding to some amino\nacids, namely, to the amino acids Y, W, C, L, F, and R.\n\n6\n\nExpansion for the PAM matrix\n\nIn the present Section we introduce the main construction of this paper: we will expand the PAM matrix A in\nthe sum of the matrices A(2) and A(\u221e) :\nA = A(2) + A(\u221e) ,\nwhere the matrix A(2) will be 2\u2013adically regular (matrix elements are close to locally constant), and the matrix\nA(\u221e) will be sparse (i.e. majority of matrix elements of this matrix will be equal to zero).\nWe propose the following choice for matrices A(2) and A(\u221e) .\n\nA(2)\n\n\u2217\nK\nN\nE\nD\nY\nQ\nH\nR\nG\n=

zero matrix elements of A(\u221e) are mainly concentrated on the lines and columns corresponding to Y,\nW, C, L, F. There are also several non\u2013zero matrix elements corresponding to R and some other amino acids.\nWe see that the non zero matrix elements of A(\u221e) are mainly concentrated on aromatic amino acids, such\nas Y, F, W, and on C which contains the SH group. Therefore deviations from 2\u2013adic regularity (i.e. the block\nstructure of the A(2) matrix) can be discussed as related to the geometric properties of the side chains of amino\nacids (for aromatic amino acids Y, F, W, and for Arginine R), and to the ability of Cysteine C to create a\ndisulfide bond.\n8\n\n\fThe above pictures show the amino acids W, R, C, F, Y corresponding to non-zero matrix elements of the\n(\u221e)\nmatrix A(\u221e) . Let us mention that amino acids F and Y for which the corresponding matrix element AF Y is\nvery large (and majority of the other matrix elements of A(\u221e) for these amino acids are negative) are very\nsimilar from the point of view of geometry.\nOf course, our analysis of PAM matrix based on the 2-adic plane representation of the genetic code is only\nthe first step in using p-adic numbers in genetics and bioinformatics in general. We hope to proceed towards\nother important problems, cf., e.g., [1]\u2013 [4], [26]. Finally, we mention the famous \"In Silico Biology\" project,\nsee, e.g., Yamato et al. [27]. We point out that, in fact, operation of any computer can be represented as\n2-adic dynamical system, see [10], [28]. Therefore 2-adic representation of the genetic code might be useful in\nrealization of the \"In Silico Biology\" project.\n\n7\n\nAppendix: the PAM matrix\n\nIn this section we discuss the construction of the Dayhoff PAM matrix, which can be found for example in [1, 2].\nWe start with blocks - ungapped multiple alignments of proteins from existing databases. Any sequence in\nthe block is no more than 15% different from any other sequence in this block.\nThen, the Markov model, which reproduces the mentioned blocks of proteins was constructed. This Markov\nmodel is defined by the amino acid substitutions (point mutations). We have the stationary distribution pa\nP\nof the probabilities of the amino acids, 20\na=1 pa = 1, and the transition probability pab , normalized by the\ncondition that the probability of a point mutation (substitution of the amino acid) at one step of the Markov\nmodel is equal to 0.01:\n20\nX\npab pb = 0.01.\na,b=1\n\nThen we take the matrix given by the n steps of the Markov model, i.e. the n-th degree P n of the matrix\nP = (pab ), and consider the matrix with the matrix elements\n\u0012 n \u0013\n(P )ab\n.\nA(n) = log10\npb\nThis matrix is known as the PAM matrix (usually n is taken to be equal to 250 and the matrix elements are\napproximated by integers).\n\n8\n\nAppendix: the genetic code\n\nThe following table describes the eucaryotic genetic code - the correspondence between codons (triples of\nnucleotides and amino acids):\n\n9\n\n\fAAA\nAAU\nAAG\nAAC\n\nK\nN\nK\nN\n\nAUA\nAUU\nAUG\nAUC\n\nI\nI\nM\nI\n\nAGA\nAGU\nAGG\nAGC\n\nR\nS\nR\nS\n\nACA\nACU\nACG\nACC\n\nT\nT\nT\nT\n\nUAA Ter\nUAU Y\nUAG Ter\nUAC Y\nUUA\nUUU\nUUG\nUUC\n\nL\nF\nL\nF\n\nUGA Ter\nUGU C\nUGG W\nUGC C\nUCA\nUCU\nUCG\nUCC\n\nS\nS\nS\nS\n\nGAA\nGAU\nGAG\nGAC\n\nE\nD\nE\nD\n\nCAA\nCAU\nCAG\nCAC\n\nQ\nH\nQ\nH\n\nGUA\nGUU\nGUG\nGUC\n\nV\nV\nV\nV\n\nCUA\nCUU\nCUG\nCUC\n\nL\nL\nL\nL\n\nGGA\nGGU\nGGG\nGGC\n\nG\nG\nG\nG\n\nCGA\nCGU\nCGG\nCGC\n\nR\nR\nR\nR\n\nGCA\nGCU\nGCG\nGCC\n\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\nCCA\nCCU\nCCG\nCCC\n\nP\nP\nP\nP\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank B.Dragovich, I.V.Volovich for fruitful discussions and\nvaluable comments.
