The real world,\nhowever, is not given apparent manifestation of the supersymmetry (SUSY), so that this\nsymmetry should be broken down somehow. Various scenarios for a SUSY breaking\nmechanism have been studied so far, such as gravity mediation [1], gauge mediation [2]\nand so forth.\nSeveral years ago, a novel type of SUSY breaking mechanism was proposed based on\nthe super-Weyl anomaly which is often referred to briefly as anomaly mediation mechanism [3][4]. The most appealing aspect of anomaly mediation is its unique predictability\nof soft breaking terms (SBT's). For example gaugino masses, scalar masses and triple\ncoupling of matter multiplets are given respectively by\n\u03b2g M \u2217\n,\ng 3\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202\u03b3i\nM\n1 \u2202\u03b3i\n\u03b2g , +\n\u03b2y\n= \u2212\n4 \u2202g\n\u2202y\n3\n\u2217\nM\n1\n.\n(\u03b3i + \u03b3j + \u03b3k )y ijk\n=\n2\n3\n\nM\u03bb =\nm2i\nAijk\n\n(1.1)\n2\n\n,\n\n(1.2)\n(1.3)\n\nHere indices i, j and k label the chiral matter multiplets. These parameters are all\ndetermined in terms of the beta functions of the gauge coupling \u03b2g , the Yukawa coupling\n\u03b2y and the anomalous dimensions \u03b3i of the i\u2212th chiral multiplet field. M is the auxiliary\nfield of the gravity multiplet whose vacuum expectation value (v.e.v.) is the source of\nSUSY breaking.\nIn spite of its high predictability, the anomaly mediation scenario is not satisfactory\nin all of its details. Namely, scalar partners of leptons are given negative mass squared.\nVarious ideas have been proposed to solve this tachyonic slepton mass problem. They are,\nhowever, necessarily to introduce additional assumptions which include: (i) new bulk field\ninteractions in extra dimensions [4][5], (ii) threshold effects due to new gauge interactions\n[6]-[8], (iii) extra Yukawa couplings [9][10], (iv) Fayet-Iliopoulos D terms of U(1) gauge\ninteractions [11]-[13] and (v) horizontal gauge symmetry [14]. All the solutions of the\ntachyonic slepton problem are of course very interesting in their own right. In this paper,\nhowever, we would like to stick to the simplicity of the original anomaly mediation as\nmuch as possible. We extend the super-Weyl to the super-Weyl-K\u00e4hler anomaly and\npursue the possibility to solve the slepton mass problem with the help of the additional\nK\u00e4hler contribution. In the course of our investigation of the singlet scalar case, we find it\nnecessary to evade the insensitivity of the anomaly mediation to ultraviolet physics along\nthe line of Nelson and Weiner [15].\n1\n\n\f2\n\nSuper-Weyl-K\u00e4hler Anomaly\n\nThe minimal supergravity coupled with matter and gauge multiplets is invariant under\nthe super-Weyl-K\u00e4hler transformation on the classical level. On the quantum level this\nsymmetry is broken down, so the theory is anomalous [16]. The quantum level anomaly\nassociated with this symmetry contains not only the auxiliary field of the gravity multiplet, M, but also the K\u00e4hler potential on the order of \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0GN . In the next paragraph\nwe recapitulate the super-Weyl anomaly contribution driven by the v.e.v. of M, thereby\nreproducing diagrammatically the SBT's. Our graphical analysis makes it easier to derive\nadditional SBT's which originate from the K\u00e4hler potential. This idea considering these\nadditional contributions was put forward for the case of the gaugino term in Ref.[17] and\nfor several SBT's in Ref.[18]. Gaillard and Nelson [18] in particular made use of the\nK\u00e4hler U(1) superspace formalism [19] to compute one-loop quantum effect. These additional terms could hopefully change the nature of the tachyonic slepton problem. In the\nfollowing, we resume this idea from phenomenological viewpoints to calculate additional\ncontribution to the scalar mass terms coming from K\u00e4hler part at the two-loop level.\n\n2.1\n\nWeyl part of Super-Weyl-K\u00e4hler Anomaly\n\nFirstly we reproduce the original SBT's (1.1) and (1.2) diagrammatically. As usual the\nsuper-Weyl anomaly arises through a triangle diagram. The connection of the superWeyl transformation is included in R, which is the chiral superfield containing the scalar\ncurvature, and we have necessarily to consider the R-inserted triangle diagram Fig.1(a).\nIn the following\u221awe use the Pauli-Villars (PV) regularization, and not only the matter\nfields Qi (= Ai + 2\u03b8\u03c7i +\u03b8\u03b8Fi ), but PV fields Q\u2032i encircle the triangle in Fig.1(a). Cardasso\nand Ovrut [16] calculated the component diagram Fig.1(b), in which the external lines\nare bosonic component, and derived the super-Weyl anomaly. If the external lines are\ngaugino \u03bb, then only the PV fields encircle in Fig.1(c) and would produce gaugino mass\nm\u03bb if the auxiliary field M is given v.e.v.\nLet us then calculate gaugino mass m\u03bb coming from Fig.1(c).

In this diagram\nonly the PV fields encircle.\nHere, Q\u2032i 's are chiral PV fields of the same representation as matter fields and \u03a6\u2032 (= A\u2032\u03a6 +\n\u221a\n2\u03b8\u03c7\u2032\u03a6 +\u03b8\u03b8F\u03a6\u2032 ) are those of the adjoint representation.

Furthermore, for the sake of simplicity we ignore Yukawa coupling.\nWe would like to consider the low energy limit of (2.1). Taking the flat limit for\ncomponent fields of gravity multiplet (graviton e \u2192 \u03b4, gravitino \u03c8 \u2192 0, auxiliary fields\nbn \u2192 0, M \u2192 0), eq.(2.1) becomes global SUSY Lagrangian Lglobal = Lglobal\n+ Lglobal\n,\nM\nG\nwhere\nZ\ni Z\nh\nglobal\n\u2020 2V\n\u2032\u2020 2V \u2032\n4\nLM\n(2.4)\n=\nd \u03b8 Qi e Qi + Qi e Qi + d2 \u03b8 m\u2032i Q\u0304\u2032i Q\u2032i + h.c.,\nZ\n1\nglobal\nLG\n=\nd2 \u03b8 2 W a\u03b1 W\u03b1a + h.c.\n4g\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\u2020 2V \u2032\n4\n+ d \u03b8 \u03a6i e \u03a6i + d2 \u03b8 m\u2032\u03a6 \u03a6\u0304\u2032i \u03a6\u2032i + h.c.\n(2.5)\nHowever, the auxiliary field M can have v.e.v. if SUSY is broken down by endowing\nhidden sector fields with v.e.v.. In this case we can take the limit, e \u2192 \u03b4, \u03c8 \u2192 0,bn \u2192\n0, M 9 0, to obtain\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2217\n\u2217\nglobal\n\u2032M\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2032 M\n\u2032\n\u2032\nL\u2192L\n+ \u2212mi\n\u0100 A \u2212 m\u03a6\n\u0100 A + h.c. .\n(2.6)\n3 i i\n3 \u03a6 \u03a6\nHere the terms proportional to M \u2217 appear in addition to the global SUSY Lagrangian\nLglobal . The point to which we should pay attention is that the effect of M appears only\nin the PV fields part. This means that, on the classical level, there is no signature of\nSUSY breaking in the sector of the ordinary fields.

The effect of K\u00e4hler potential also\nappears in the term containing only PV fields in eq.(2.10). However there is a difference\nworth remarking, i.e., the term \u03ba2 Ki F i appears only in the matter PV fields Q\u2032i , but not\nin the gauge PV fields \u03a6\u2032i . Hence including the effect of the K\u00e4hler symmetry amounts to\n\u2217\nreplacing M3 by the following way\n\nM\u2217\nM\u2217 2 2\n\u2192\n\u2212 \u03ba Ki F i ,\n3\n3\n3\n\n(2.11)\n\n\u2217\n\nwithout touching upon M3 in the \u03a6\u2032i part. Note that the term TRj in (2.7) and (2.8) comes\nfrom the matter PV fields Q\u2032i and the term 3CG from \u03a6\u2032i . We are thus led to formulas\n\"\n\u001b#\n\u001a \u2217\n\u2217\n2\nX\ng\nM\n2\nM\nM\u03bb =\n\u22123CG\n,\n(2.12)\n+\nTRj\n\u2212 \u03ba2 Ki F i\n2\n(4\u03c0)\n3\n3\n3\nj\n#\n\"\n2\n2\n\u2217\n4\nX\ng\n2\nM\nM\nm2i =\n,\n(2.13)\n\u2212\nTRj\n\u2212 \u03ba2 Ki F i\nCR 3CG\n(4\u03c0)4\n3\n3\n3\nj\nwhich are more general than (2.7) and (2.8) and encompass the super-Weyl-K\u00e4hler anomaly.\nThe formula (2.12) agrees with the results obtained previously in Refs.[17] and [18]. The\ntwo-loop result (2.13) for the scalar masses is our new formula.\n\n3\n\nTachyonic Slepton Problem\n\nLet us consider the tachyonic slepton problem on the basis of our new formula (2.13).\nOur following discussions differ for the case of gauge non-singlet scalar from the singlet\ncase, such as right handed slepton in MSSM. This is because the first term in the brackets\nof (2.13) is absent for the gauge singlet case. Let us begin with the non-singlet case.\nOn looking at our formulae (2.13), we immediately notice the possibility that the second\nnegative contribution could be rendered very small in contrast to (2.8) by choosing\nM\u2217 2 2\n\u2212 \u03ba Ki F i \u2248 0,\n3\n3\n5\n\n(3.1)\n\n\fthereby making m2i positive. We now argue that eq.(3.1) is realized in fact quite possibly\nin general class of models. As a toy model, we take the following simple O'Raifeartaigh\nmodel in the hidden sector, whose superpotential is given by\nP = aX(Z 2 \u2212 m2hid ) + bmhid Y Z.\n\n(3.2)\n\nHere a and b are complex dimensionless parameters, mhid is a typical mass parameter in\nthe hidden sector and X, Y and Z are chiral superfields. According to [20], M \u2217 is given,\nby virtue of equations of motion, in terms of the superpotential,\nM\u2217\n2\n= \u2212\u03ba2 e\u03ba K/2 P \u2217.\n3\n\n(3.3)\n\nFor example, suppose that the mass scale of the hidden sector is on the order of 1014\nGeV. It then turns out that \u03ba2 K is negligibly small and we\nare able to express (3.3) as\n\u221a\n20\na polynomial of a and b. If these parameters satisfy b \u2248 3 ia (a = real) then we find\neq.(3.1) is realized. We have thus found a possibility to get around the tachyonic slepton\nproblem.\nUntil now we have assumed that the contribution of anomaly mediation is more dominant than that of gravity mediation. One may perhaps wonder whether we also have to\ninclude the effect due to gravity mediation to the slepton mass in so far as the hidden\nand visible sectors are bridged. We are, however, still able to choose the K\u00e4hler potential\nand superpotential in such a way that the gravity mediation effects can be neglected.\nLet us turn to the singlet case. If we demand (3.1), the scalar mass squared (2.13)\nis zero because CG term is absent, and this situation is unrealistic. To overcome the\ndrawback we extend our model a little further. Original anomaly mediation has the\nproperty to be insensitive to ultraviolet physics. The induced SBT's are independent\nof fields which have heavy masses. The heavy mass threshold effect dose not appear.\nExtending the model, however, we can evade this property. Nelson and Weiner [15]\nhave introduced a bilinear coupling in the K\u00e4hler potential and have seen violation of the\ninsensitivity due to the threshold correction. We now take their idea into our consideration\nof the singlet case. Due to bilinear terms the ultraviolet insensitivity is spoiled, so our\nprediction can be possibly modified. (Adding bilinear couplings, a mass scale could be\nintroduced, whose mass scale looks like the Higgs \u03bc parameter. We may get, however, an\nundesirable prediction of the so-called B term, and we leave it open for now.)\nTo have an insight into the effect of bilinear coupling, let us recall the essence of the\nultraviolet insensitivity. The low energy limit of a field W with the heavy mass mW is\nsimilar to (2.10),\n\u0014\n\u001a \u2217\n\u001b\n\u0015\nM\n2 2\nglobal\ni\nLW \u2192 LW + \u2212mW\n\u2212 \u03ba Ki F \u0100W AW + h.c. .\n(3.4)\n3\n3\n6\n\n\fIf mW is large enough, the effect from heavy fields is the same as the one from PV fields\nand hence is equivalent to adding another PV field. As far as the effect is independent\nof the regularization, the heavy field effect is not seen. In this sense even if the K\u00e4hler\npotential term is included, the insensitivity is preserved. Thus heavy fields effect vanish\nand anomaly mediation is insensitive to physics in the ultraviolet.\nThe insensitivity is , however, no longer true, if we add two chiral fields H and H\u0304 with\nbilinear coupling. The part of the K\u00e4hler potential of additional fields is\nKH = H \u2020 H + H\u0304 \u2020 H\u0304 \u2212 cH\u0304H \u2212 c\u2217 H\u0304 \u2020 H \u2020 ,\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere c is the parameter describing the bilinear coupling. Applying the same limit as in\n(2.6), the Lagrangian of additional fields is\n\u0014\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0015\nM\u2217 2 2\nglobal\ni\nLH \u2192 LH + \u2212mc \u2212\n(3.6)\n\u2212 \u03ba Ki F \u0100h Ah + h.c. ,\n3\n3\nwhere mc = cM\n. On looking at (3.4) and (3.6), we immediately notice a remarkable\n3\n\u2217\ndifference in sign in front of M3 . Because of this difference, the heavy fields H and H\u0304\ndiscriminate themselves from PV fields and the threshold effects survive the low energy\nlimit. At the threshold mc , below which the additional fields decouple, the U(1) gaugino\nmass MU (1) for example is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001M\u2217\n\u03b1(mc ) X\n.\n(3.7)\n2\nTRH + TRH\u0304\nMU (1) =\n4\u03c0\n3\n\nHere we have included an arbitrary number of (H, H\u0304) pairs and the summation in (3.7)\nis taken over the pairs. where the sum is over additional fields. Because of the threshold\ncorrection, SBT's are no longer on the anomaly mediation trajectory. We must take\naccount of the running effect from mc to \u03bc. Solving renormalization group equation, we\nfind that the U(1) gaugino mass and the singlet scalar mass m2singlet at the energy scale\n\u03bc are\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0001M\u2217\n\u03b1(\u03bc) X\nTRH + TRH\u0304\n,\n(3.8)\nMU (1) =\n2\n4\u03c0\n3\n\" \bP\n\u0001 2\n\b 2\nT\n+\nT\n8C\nR\nR\nR\nH\nH\u0304\nP\nm2singlet =\n\u03b1 (mc ) \u2212 \u03b12 (\u03bc)\n(4\u03c0)2\nT\nR\nj\nj\n\u0015\n2\n\u0001 2\nM\n1X\nTRH + TRH\u0304 \u03b1 (mc )\n.\n(3.9)\n\u2212\n2\n3\nThese formulae replace the previous ones, (2.12) and (2.13).\n7\n\n\fIn order to see if the threshold corrections are large enough, let us look for conditions to\nbe imposed on the number of (H, H\u0304) pairs. We assume M3 \u223c100TeV which guarantees that\nthe gaugino masses\nare on the\n\u0001 order of 1TeV. We also assume c \u223c O(1) and \u03bc \u223c100GeV.\nP\nTRH + TRH\u0304 >22 is the necessary condition to ensure msinglet > 100GeV\nWe then find\nfor the case that H and H\u0304 are all SU(2) singlet. In other words, if the number of (H, H\u0304)\npairs is greater than eleven, we get positive scalar masses. Finally we remark that the\nmasses of the gauge non-singlet scalars are not much affected by the threshold effects. We\ncan in fact easily confirm that\n(2.13) to the non-singlet scalars are more\n\u0001\nP the contributions\nTRH + TRH\u0304 = 24 than the threshold effects.\ndominant numerically for\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nLet us summarize what we have done in this letter. The theory of supergravity coupled\nwith chiral matters and gauge multiplet is invariant under the super-Weyl-K\u00e4hler transformation, and the symmetry has the anomaly to be broken down on the quantum level.\nOur diagrammatical analysis has shown that the K\u00e4hler part of the anomaly is mediated\nin parallel with the super-Weyl part which has been studied previously. The SBT's which\nhave been known to contain M in the anomaly mediation scenario, have now new contribution driven by K\u00e4hler part of anomaly and the whole effect is summarized by (2.12)\nand (2.13).\nIf the condition (3.1) is satisfied, the mass squared of the non-singlet scalar such as left\nhanded slepton can be positive. In the singlet scalar case, however, the formulae (2.13)\ncombined with (3.1) leads to a vanishing mass squared m2singlet \u2248 0, which is of course\nunfavorable. To circumvent such a prediction, we have taken account of the threshold\ncorrection, by which deviation from the anomaly mediation trajectory is introduced. We\nhave seen that the threshold corrections elevate the masses of gaugino and gauge singlet\nscalar, for example U(1) case, as in (3.8) and (3.9). We have thus got the possibility of\nsolving the tachyonic slepton problem.\n\nAcknowledgement\nWe would like to thank Prof. B.
