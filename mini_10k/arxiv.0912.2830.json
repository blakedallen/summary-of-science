Measuring this quantity by Monte Carlo simulations for q = 8, we construct a\nphase diagram and identify critical properties across the phase-separation lines among the true longrange order, quasi long-range order, and disorder. Our result supports the theoretical prediction\nthat there appears a discontinuous order-disorder transition as soon as the two phase-separation\nlines merge.\nPACS numbers: 64.60.Cn,75.10.Hk,05.10.Ln\n\n1\n\n\fThe existence of quasi long-range order (LRO) characterizes the critical behavior of the\ntwo-dimensional XY model [1, 2, 3] as well as its dual, the solid-on-solid (SOS) model to\ndescribe the roughning transition on a surface [4, 5, 6, 7]. By quasi LRO, we mean that\nthe spin-spin correlation function decays algebraically, which implies that the system is not\nmagnetically ordered. We will refer to a phase having such characteristics as quasiliquid [8].\nThe lack of true magnetic order for the XY model is attributed to spin-wave excitations,\nwhich are gapless and thus excited at any finite temperature. On the other hand, the quasi\nLRO is broken by the vortex-pair unbinding at the Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition\nwhich exhibits an essential singularity. Even though the XY model assumes the continuous\nU(1) symmetry in the spin angle \u03b8, essentially the same nature is observed when the angle\nis discretized into q possible values over \u03b8 = 0, 2\u03c0\n, . . . , 2\u03c0(q\u22121)\n, as long as q is high enough.\nq\nq\nSuch a discrete-spin system is called the q-state clock model if two neighboring spins, which\nhave \u03b8i = 2\u03c0ni /q and \u03b8j = 2\u03c0nj /q with integers ni and nj , respectively, interact via cosine\npotential V (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) = \u2212J cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) with a ferromagnetic coupling constant J > 0. One\ncan generalize this interaction with preserved symmetry, V (\u03b8) = V (\u2212\u03b8) = V (\u03b8 + 2\u03c0), into\nthe form given by the Hamiltonian\nH=\n\nX\nhi,ji\n\nVp (\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ) =\n\nX 2J \u0014\nhi,ji\n\np2\n\n2p2\n\n1 \u2212 cos\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j\n2\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8i is the ith spin angle, and the sum runs over nearest neighbors [9]. It recovers the\nq-state clock model at p = 1 and approaches the q-state Potts model in the limit of large\np [10]. We denote the system defined by Eq. (1) as the generalized q-state clock model.\nSince it has been claimed that this model with p = 1 and q \u2265 8 precisely reproduces the\nKT transition [8], we set q = 8 throughout this work. At the same time, the discreteness\nintroduces a finite gap in the spin-wave excitation, making the true LRO realizable at low\ntemperatures [11, 12, 13, 14]. These two phase transitions are connected by the duality\nrelation, which is exactly established within the Villain approximation [15]. While the\nappearance of the quasi LRO is readily detected by observables such as Binder's fourthorder cumulant [5, 16] or helicity modulus [17, 18, 19] that of the true LRO has been\nobserved by changes in specific heat or magnetization [8, 12, 20]. It is, however, rather\nhard to locate the transition temperature using these quantities, especially for high p values\nwhere the quasi LRO exists in a very narrow temperature range. Thus alternative quantities\nare required, for example, like a direct observation of the formation of giant clusters [21].\n2\n\n\f1\u00d710-3\n\n-1\n\n0\n-1\n\n(a)\n\n0\nRe(m)\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0\n-1\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n1\n\nRe(m)\n\n1\u00d710-2\n\n1\n\nIm(m)\n\n0\n\n1\u00d710-3\n\n1\n\nIm(m)\n\nIm(m)\n\n1\n\n0\n-1\n\n(c)\n\n0\n\n1\n\nRe(m)\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Distributions of the order parameter m on the complex plane, obtained for\np = 1, q = 8, and L = 8. We start from the high-temperature regime and then cool down the\nsystem slowly. Here are shown three characteristic distributions, where one finds (a) a disordered\nphase at temperature T = 1.50, (b) a quasiliquid phase at T = 0.70, and (c) an ordered phase at\nT = 0.36, where the temperatures are given in units of J/kB .\n\nIn this Rapid Communication, we show that the transition can be well localized by a nonlocal order parameter which is obtained from the average spin direction and which makes a\nclear distinction between the true and quasi LROs. Using this quantity it is shown that the\nquasiliquid phase disappears beyond p \u2243 2.8, where the transition becomes discontinuous\njust as for the eight-state Potts model.\nLet us consider the generalized eight-state clock model given above on the L \u00d7 L square\nlattice with the system size N = L2 .

[22], it is instructive to visualize the distribution of m on the complex plane. The\ndistributions in Fig. 1 are obtained by running Monte Carlo simulations with the singlecluster update algorithm [23, 24, 25], and each panel represents a different phase of the\neight-state clock model at a different temperature. In the leftmost panel [Fig. 1(a)], we see\nthe disordered phase in the high-temperature regime. The order parameter m exhibits a\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian peak around the origin, which may be regarded as a delta peak\nat |m| = 0 in the thermodynamic limit. Figure 1(b) illustrates the quasiliquid phase, where\nthe order parameter rotates in the \u03c6 direction with nonzero magnitude. Note that both of\nthe distributions in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) manifest a continuous rotational symmetry, which is\nspontaneously broken at a lower temperature as shown in Fig. 1(c).

(7) with \u03b7/2 = 0.031, which best describes the data with a single curve.\n\nbeing established so that m indicates well-defined directions selected from the eight-fold\nsymmetry.\nA major difference between Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) lies in the distributions of |m|. The transition between the quasiliquid and disordered phases can be detected by means of Binder's\nfourth-order cumulant,\n\nh|m|4 i\n,\n(3)\n2 h|m|2 i2\nwhere h* * *i represents the thermal average [Fig. 2(a)]. The factor of two in the denominator\nUm = 1 \u2212\n\n2\n\nof Eq. (3) is based on the fact that h|m|4 i = 2 h|m|2 i for such a two-dimensional Gaussian\ndistribution as in Fig. 1(a). We should note that Um does not detect the transition between\nthe ordered and quasiliquid phases since they differ only in the angular direction on the\ncomplex plane. Henceforth, we need a quantity capturing the change along \u03c6. In the same\nspirit as Um , one may define a cumulant as\nD E\n5 \u03c6\u03034\nU\u03c6 = 1 \u2212 D E2 ,\n9 \u03c6\u03032\n4\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere \u03c6\u0303 \u2261 (2\u03c0)\u22121 (q\u03c6 mod 2\u03c0) so that U\u03c6 goes to zero when the distribution is uniform with\nrespect to \u03c6. Or we may alternatively have\nm\u03c6 = hcos(q\u03c6)i ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich yields a finite value when \u03c6 is frozen but again vanishes when \u03c6 is isotropically\ndistributed [Fig. 2(b)]. Provided that the system is nearly ordered with large enough q,\nP\nwe approximately have \u03c6 \u2248 N \u22121 j \u03b8j from Eq. (2) so that m\u03c6 \u2248 hcos(2\u03c0n\u0304)i with n\u0304 =\nP\nN \u22121 j nj . By duality, the integer field nj can be mapped to a charge distribution in the\nlattice Coulomb gas [15] and the approximate expression for m\u03c6 has been introduced in\n\nRef. [7] to monitor the fugacity of charged particles under numerical renormalization-group\ncalculations. Since the quasiliquid phase exists between the ordered and disordered phases\nfor q = 8, we have two separate transitions at T = Tc1 and Tc2 , which are clearly detected by\nthe above quantities. Note the movements of data points in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) with different\nsystem sizes. Since the position of an inflection point, T\u2217 , would correspond to where the\ntransition occurs in the thermodynamic limit, we may extrapolate them according to the\nKT scenario,\nln L \u223c |T\u2217 \u2212 Tc |\u22121/2 ,\n\n(6)\n\nto estimate the critical temperatures both for the upper and lower transitions [Fig. 2(c)].\nIn addition, regarding h|m|i = L\u2212\u03b7/2 m\u0303(L, T ) around Tc1 [26], we replace the dependency on\nboth of L and T by that on a single variable m\u03c6 = m\u03c6 (L, T ) so that\nh|m|i = L\u2212\u03b7/2 f (m\u03c6 ).\n\n(7)\n\nIn other words, plotting h|m|i L\u03b7/2 against m\u03c6 , data from different sizes are expected to fall\non a single curve if one correctly selects \u03b7. This provides a way to determine \u03b7 even without\nprecise knowledge of Tc1 (see also Ref. [27]). The best fit is found at \u03b7/2 = 0.031(2) as shown\nin Fig. 2(d), while the theoretical value is given as \u03b7/2 = 1/32 = 0.03125 at T = Tc1 [14].\nWhen altering the potential shape by increasing p in Eq. (1), one may well expect that the\ntwo transitions will eventually transform into a single, discontinuous transition at a certain p\nvalue as the Potts-model limit is approached. How this happens can be found by numerical\nsimulations, and a phase diagram thereby obtained is shown in Fig. 3(a). It seems that the\ntwo phase-separation lines merge as p approaches 3.0. A better estimate is obtained by look\u0001\ning at magnetic susceptibility.

If p is small enough to\nexhibit the quasiliquid phase, susceptibility indeed diverges over a finite temperature range.\nFor p = 2.8, however, we find that data points fall on \u03c7 \u223c |T \u2212 Tc |\u22121.2 which has only one\nsingular point at T = Tc [Fig. 3(b)]. This Tc is also consistent with the results from Um and\nm\u03c6 . We therefore conclude that the quasiliquid phase shrinks to a single point at p \u2243 2.8.\nFurthermore, the distribution of energy per spin, E, exhibits double peaks for p & 2.8. By\nanalogy with Um , we introduce the following quantity:\nVE = 1 \u2212\n\n(E \u2212 hEi)4\n3 (E \u2212 hEi)2\n\n2.\n\n(8)\n\nRecall that if a scalar variable x has a one-dimensional Gaussian distribution with zero\n2\n\nmean, one readily finds hx4 i = 3 hx2 i . Consequently, VE will vanish when there exists\na single peak positioned at hEi. It will approach a nontrivial value, however, when the\n6\n\n\fenergy distribution has double peaks on opposite sides of the average value hEi. A similar\nattempt to define such a quantity has already been made in Ref. [26] for characterizing a\ndiscontinuous transition. Figure 3(c) shows that VE remains finite at p & 2.8, which signals\na change to a discontinuous transition [11, 12].\nThe concept of universality suggests that the critical properties will be kept the same in\nthe vicinity of p = 1. However, one may ask if the natures of the transitions between the\nordered and quasiliquid phases and between the quasiliquid and disordered phases depend\non the value of p. Applying Eq. (7) to higher p values, we find that \u03b7 = 1/16 cannot be ruled\nout even when p approaches 2. However, the quality of fit severely deteriorates at p higher\nthan 2, possibly due to that our magnetization data are easily influenced by the proximity\nof the upper transition. On the other hand, with the same motivation as in Eq. (7), we may\ncharacterize the upper transition by means of the following scaling relation [27]:\n\u03c7 = L2\u2212\u03b7 g(Um ).\n\n(9)\n\nThis method yields \u03b7 = 0.24(1) at p = 1.0 in agreement with the prediction of 1/4 = 0.25\nfor the KT transition [1]. It is not very surprising that \u03b7 tends to be underestimated here if\ntaking into account the logarithmic correction involved in susceptibility [28, 29]. We observe\nfrom our numerical data that the criticality deviates from the standard KT type below the\nmerging point. If we take p = 2.6, for instance, the best fit is found at \u03b7 = 0.41 and the size\ndependence of the transition temperatures deviates from Eq. (6) [Fig. 3(d)]. Still, it remains\nto be investigated in detail how the critical behavior begins to change or if the standard\nKT behavior is recovered for even larger lattice sizes (L > 512) in spite of the data collapse\nshown in Fig. 3(d) for lattice sizes up to L = 512.\nIn summary, we have proposed a practical quantity to distinguish the true and quasi\nLROs, based on the order-parameter distribution. Using this quantity, we have provided a\nphase diagram on the p \u2212 T plane for the generalized eight-state clock model. It has been\nshown that a discontinuous transition appears when the phase-separation lines merge into\none at p \u2243 2.8. We have also checked critical properties along the lines and found changes\nin scaling behaviors before reaching the merging point from numerical calculations up to\nL = 512.\nS.K.B. and P.M. acknowledge the support from the Swedish Research Council with the\nGrant No. 621-2002-4135, and B.J.K. was supported by WCU(World Class University)\n7\n\n\fprogram through the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Ministry of\nEducation, Science and Technology (Grant No. R31-2008-000-10029-0).
