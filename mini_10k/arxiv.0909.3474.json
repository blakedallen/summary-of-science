Providing answers to those questions we bring out the role played by different physical processes in\nthe dynamics of spherical collapse.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe gravitational collapse of massive stars and its resulting remnant (neutron\nstar or black hole) represent one of the few observable scenarios where general\nrelativity is expected to play a relevant role. Therefore, a detailed description\nof gravitational collapse and the modelling of the structure of compact objects\nunder a variety of conditions remain among the most interesting problems\nthat general relativity has to deal with. This fact explains the great attraction\nthat these problems exert on the community of the relativists.\n\u2217\n\nOn leave from UCV, Caracas, Venezuela, e-mail: lherrera@usal.es\n\n1\n\n\fMotivated by the above arguments, we present here a discussion on selfgravitating relativistic fluids, emphasizing the role played by some specific\nphysical phenomena like local anisotropy of pressure, dissipation and electric\ncharge. The discussion will be centred on the answers to a list of questions\nrelated to essential aspects of the dynamics of gravitational collapse.\nThese questions are:\n\u2022 Why is the gravitational collapse a highly dissipative process?\n\u2022 Is there life between quasi\u2013equilibrium and non\u2013equilibrium?\n\u2022 What happens if we relax the Pascal principle? (and why?)\n\u2022 How do electric charge and dissipation affect the evolution of massive\nstars?\n\n2\n\nWHY IS THE GRAVITATIONAL COLLAPSE A HIGHLY DISSIPATIVE PROCESS?\n\nIn order to answer to this question let us present some very rough estimates.\nThe important point is that no matter how much we refine them, the answer\nwill be essentially the same.\nSo, let us consider a massive star which collapses producing a one solar mass neutron star, and let us further assume that this process proceeds\nadiabatically.\nNow a rough calculation for the gravitational binding energy of a one\nsolar mass of 10 Km radius, given by\nGM 2\n6.6 \u00d7 10\u22128 g \u22121 cm3 s\u22122 1066 g 2\n\u2248\u2212\nR\n106 cm\nwith M = M\u2299 \u2248 2.1033 g; R \u2248 10Km\nproduces\nE \u2248 \u22121053 erg.\nE\u2248\u2212\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nThen at least 1053 erg has to be generated during the collapse, therefore\nif we assume that collapse proceeds adiabatically then internal energy (Ein )\nhas to increase by that amount.\n2\n\n\fNext, assuming\nEin \u2248 kT,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the Boltzman constant is k \u2248 1.3 \u00d7 10\u221216 erg.K \u22121 . Then the temperature of such a system should rise to the absurd value\nT \u2248 1069 K,\n\n(4)\n\nimplying that after all it should radiate with a luminosity\nL \u2248 10283 erg.s\u22121,\n\n(5)\n\nwhich would evaporate our object at a time scale of the order of\nt \u2248 (10)\u2212230 s.\n\n(6)\n\nThis sequence of \"absurdities\" is produced by the original assumption of\nadiabaticity. The fact is that in the process of collapse the system has to get\nrid of a huge amount of energy (\u2248 1053 erg ). Accordingly dissipation and\nradiative transport within the star are bound to play an essential role in the\ndynamics of collapse.\nWe shall come back to this point in the last section.\n\n3\n\nIS THERE LIFE BETWEEN\nQUASI\u2013EQUILIBRIUM AND\nNON\u2013EQUILIBRIUM?\n\nIn the study of gravitational collapse it is usual to appeal to numerical methods, which allow for considering more realistic equations of state. However,\nthe obtained results, in general, are restricted and highly model dependent.\nAlso, specific difficulties, associated with numerical solutions of partial differential equations in presence of shocks, further complicate the problem.\nOn the other hand, analytical solutions although more suitable for a general discussion, are found, either for too simplistic equations of state and/or\nunder additional heuristic assumptions whose justification is usually uncertain.\nOn the grounds of the comments above, it is justified to introduce seminumerical techniques, which may be regarded as a \"compromise\" between the\n3\n\n\fanalytical and numerical approaches. These techniques developed in [1], [2]\nand [3] are based on a general algorithm for modelling self\u2013gravitating spheres\nout of equilibrium.\nThe proposed method, starting from any interior (analytical) static spherically symmetric (\"seed\") solution to Einstein equations, leads to a system\nof ordinary differential equations for quantities evaluated at the boundary\nsurface of the fluid distribution, whose solution (numerical), allows for modelling, dynamic, self-gravitating spheres, whose static limit is the original\n\"seed\" solution.\nThe approach is based on the introduction of a set of conveniently defined\n\"effective\" variables (effective pressure and energy density) and an heuristic\nansatz on the latter, whose rationale and justification become intelligible\nwithin the context of the post-quasistatic approximation. In the quasistatic\napproximation, the effective variables coincide with the corresponding physical variables (pressure and density) and therefore the method may be regarded as an iterative method with each consecutive step corresponding to\na stronger departure from equilibrium.\nSuch a seminumerical technique requires the possibility to approach the\nnon\u2013equilibrium state by means of successive approximations, implying an\naffirmative answer to the question posed in the title of this section.\nIn order to show in some detail the basic features of the proposed approach, let us first give a very brief description of the Bondi formalism for\nthe description of spherical collapse in non\u2013comoving coordinates (see [4] for\ndetails).\nThe line element is given in Schwarzschild\u2013like coordinates by\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nds2 = e\u03bd dt2 \u2212 e\u03bb dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bd(t, r) and \u03bb(t, r) are functions of their arguments.\nThe metric given in (7) should satisfy the Einstein equations\nG\u03bd\u03bc = 8\u03c0T\u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(8)\n\nIn order to give physical significance to the T\u03bd\u03bc components we apply the\nBondi approach [4].\nThus, following Bondi, let us introduce purely locally Minkowski coordinates\n(\u03c4, x, y, z)\n4\n\n\fd\u03c4 = e\u03bd/2 dt ;\n\ndx = e\u03bb/2 dr ;\n\ndy = rd\u03b8 ;\n\ndz = rsin\u03b8d\u03c6.\n\nThen, denoting the Minkowski components of the energy tensor by a bar, we\nhave\nT\u030400 = T00 ;\n\nT\u030411 = T11 ;\n\nT\u030422 = T22 ;\n\nT\u030433 = T33 ;\n\nT\u030401 = e\u2212(\u03bd+\u03bb)/2 T01 .\n\nNext, we suppose that when viewed by an observer moving relative to these\ncoordinates with proper velocity \u03c9 in the radial direction, the physical content of space consists of an anisotropic fluid of energy density \u03c1, radial pressure Pr , tangential pressure P\u22a5 , radial heat flux q (which models dissipation\nin the diffusion approximation) and unpolarized radiation of energy density \u01eb\ntraveling in the radial direction (which models dissipation in the free streaming regime). Thus, when viewed by this (comoving with the fluid) observer\nthe covariant tensor in Minkowski coordinates is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n\u03c1 + \u01eb \u2212q \u2212 \u01eb 0\n0\n\u2212q \u2212 \u01eb Pr + \u01eb 0\n0\n0\n0\nP\u22a5 0\n0\n0\n0 P\u22a5\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\nThen a Lorentz transformation gives us the components of T\u03bd\u03bc in terms of\nthe physical variables defined by the comoving Minkowskian observer.\nThus Einstein equations read:\n1\n\u03c1 + Pr \u03c9 2\n2\u03c9q\n\u01eb(1 + \u03c9)\n1\n\u03bb\u2032\n1\n\u2212\u03bb\n\u2212\n+\n+\n=\n\u2212\n+\ne\n\u2212\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n1\u2212\u03c9\n8\u03c0\nr2\nr2\nr\n(\n\nPr + \u03c1\u03c9 2\n2\u03c9q\n\u01eb(1 + \u03c9)\n1 1\n1\n\u03bd\u2032\n\u2212\u03bb\n+\n+\n=\n\u2212\n\u2212\ne\n+\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n1\u2212\u03c9\n8\u03c0 r 2\nr2\nr\n(\n\n(\n\u0011\n1 e\u2212\u03bd \u0010\n2\u03bb\u0308 + \u03bb\u0307(\u03bb\u0307 \u2212 \u03bd\u0307)\nP\u22a5 = \u2212\n8\u03c0 4\n!)\n\u2212\u03bb\ne\n\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bb\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u20322\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u2212\n2\u03bd + \u03bd \u2212 \u03bb \u03bd + 2\n,\n4\nr\n\n5\n\n!)\n\n!)\n\n,\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\n(11)\n\n\f\u03bb+\u03bd\n\n\u03bb+\u03bd\n\n\u03bb+\u03bd\n\n(\u03c1 + Pr )\u03c9e 2\n\u03bb\u0307\nqe 2\ne 2 \u01eb(1 + \u03c9)\n2\n+\n(1\n+\n\u03c9\n)\n+\n=\u2212\n,\n(12)\n2\n2\n1\u2212\u03c9\n1\u2212\u03c9\n1\u2212\u03c9\n8\u03c0r\nwhere dot denotes diferentiation with respect to t and prime denotes r derivatives.\nThis is a system of four equations in partial derivatives for eight unknown\nfunctions: \u03bd, \u03bb, \u03c1, Pr , P\u22a5 , \u01eb, q, \u03c9. Accordingly additional information has to be\ngiven in order to integrate the system. Observe that if the metric functions\nare completely determined, the system (9\u201312) becomes an algebraic system\nof four equations for six unknown functions, implying that the system is not\ncompletely determined unless, infomation is provided through two additional\nequations. In other words the complete knowledge of spacetime is not enough\nto reproduce all physical properties of the sources, a fact which is known but\nusually overlooked.\nWe shall assume our fluid distribution to be bounded by a spherical surface \u03a3 outside of which we have the Vaydia spacetime. In order to avoid the\nexistence of shells on \u03a3, we shall demand the first and second fundamental\nform to be continuous across it (Darmois).\nIt is sometimes useful to consider the \"conservation\" laws derived from\nthe Bianchi identities,\n\u03bc\nT\u03bd;\u03bc\n= 0.\n(13)\nwhich, even though contain no further information than that found in Einstein equations may provide an interesting hindsight on the problem.\nThus for example in the static case the radial component of (13) reads\nPr\u2032 = \u2212\n\nm + 4\u03c0Pr r 3\n2 (P\u22a5 \u2212 Pr )\n(\u03c1 + Pr ) +\n,\nr (r \u2212 2m)\nr\n\n(14)\n\nwhere m is the mass function defined by\nZ r\nr\nm(r, t) = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb ) = 4\u03c0\nT00 r 2 dr.\n2\n0\n\n(15)\n\nEquation (14) is the well known Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkov equation\n(generalized for an anisotropic fluid) whose physical meaning has been extensively discussed in literature.\nNow, we may distinguish three possible regimes of evolution, namely:\n\n6\n\n\f\u2022 Equilibrium. There is no evolution (\u03c9 = 0), metric and physical variables are independent on t and equation (14) is satisfied.\n\u2022 Quasi\u2013equilibrium. The system evolves, but \"very slowly\", meaning\nthat it changes on time scales much larger than hydrostatic time scale\nimplying \u03c9 2 \u2248 0. Thus equation (14) is satisfied at all times and the\nevolution may be regarded as a sequence of equilibrium states.\n\u2022 Non\u2013equilibrium. The system changes on time scales of the order of\n(or smaller than) hydrostatic time scale.\nNow the original question in the title of this section is equivalent to: Can\nwe approach the non\u2013equilibrium by means of successive aproximations? As\nwe shall see, whenever the answer to this question is affirmative, we can describe the evolution of the system by means of a method implying resolution\nof ordinary differential equations instead of partial differential equations.\n\n3.1\n\nEffective variables and the post\u2013quasi\u2013static approximation: The life between quasi\u2013equilibrium\nand non\u2013equilibrium\n\nLet us introduce the following variables:\n\u03c1\u0303 = T00 =\n\n2q\u03c9\n(1 + \u03c9)\n\u03c1 + Pr \u03c9 2\n+\n+\u01eb\n,\n2\n2\n1\u2212\u03c9\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9 )\n1\u2212\u03c9\n\n(16)\n\nPr + \u03c1\u03c9 2\n2q\u03c9\n(1 + \u03c9)\n+\n+\u01eb\n.\n(17)\n2\n2\n1\u2212\u03c9\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9 )\n1\u2212\u03c9\nwhich we shall call respectively \"effective density\" and \"effective pressure\".\nObserve that in equilibrium and quasi\u2013equilibrium the \"effective\" variables\ncoincide with the corresponding physical variables (energy density and radial\npressure).\nNext it follows at once from the field equations that:\nP\u0303 = \u2212T11 =\n\nr\nm = (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03bb ) = 4\u03c0\n2\n\u03bd = \u03bd\u03a3 +\n\nZ\n\nr\n\nr\u03a3\n\nZ\n\nr\n\nr 2 \u03c1\u0303dr,\n\n(18)\n\n2(4\u03c0r 3P\u0303 + m)\ndr.\nr(r \u2212 2m)\n\n(19)\n\n7\n\n0\n\n\fwhere r = r\u03a3 is the equation of the boundary of the fluid distribution and\nsubindex \u03a3 indicates that the quantity is evaluated at the boundary surface.\nThus it follows from the above that the radial dependence of metric functions is determined by the effective variables, this in turn implies that the\nradial dependence of a given fluid distribution is the same in the equilibrium\nand the quasi\u2013equilibrium regime.\nNow if we assume that we can approach the non\u2013equilibrium by successive approximations, the question is: what could we assume next for a regime\nafter the quasi\u2013equilibrium (equation (14) is not satisfied)? From the considerations above it appears that the only sensible assumption for such a regime\nwould be that metric variables share the same radial dependence that they\nhave in equilibrium (or quasi\u2013equilibrium). This assumption which we shall\ncall post\u2013quasistatic\u2013approximation allows us to develop an algorithm to describe (within such approximation) the evolution of self\u2013gravitating spheres.\n3.1.1\n\nThe algorithm for modelling spheres out of equilibrium\n\n1. Take an interior (seed) solution to Einstein equations, representing a\nfluid distribution of matter in equilibrium, with a given\n\u03c1st = \u03c1(r)\n\nPr st = Pr (r)\n\n2. Assume that the r\u2013dependence of P\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303 is the same as that of Pr st\nand \u03c1st , respectively, which implies that metric functions share the\nsame radial dependence as that of the seed solution (the post\u2013quasi\u2013\nstatic\u2013approximation).\n3. Using equations (18) and (19), with the r dependence of P\u0303 and \u03c1\u0303, one\ngets m and \u03bd up to some functions of t, which have to be determined.\n4. For these functions of t one has three ordinary differential equations\n(hereafter referred to as surface equations), namely:\n(a) \u03c9 = \u1e59\u03a3 e(\u03bb\u2212\u03bd)/2 evaluated on r = r\u03a3 .\n\u03bc\n(b) Tr;\u03bc\n= 0 evaluated on r = r\u03a3 .\n\n(c) The equation relating the total mass loss rate with the energy flux\nthrough the boundary surface.\n8\n\n\f5. Depending on the kind of matter under consideration, the system of\nsurface equations described above may be closed with the additional\ninformation provided by the transport equation and/or the equation of\nstate for the anisotropic pressure and/or additional information about\nsome of the physical variables evaluated on the boundary surface (e.g.\nthe luminosity).\n6. Once the system of surface equations is closed, it may be integrated for\nany particular initial data.\n7. Feeding back the result of integration in the expressions for m and \u03bd,\nthese two functions are completely determined.\n8. With the input from the point 7 above, and using field equations, together with the equations of state and/or transport equation, all physical variables may be found for any piece of matter distribution.\nIf the system is \"very far\" from equilibrium then it could be necessary\nto go through the process once again by replacing the seed solution by the\nsolution obtained from the point 8 above. This could be done as many times\nas it is required to obtain a satisfactory description of the system under\nconsideration.\n\n4\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF WE RELAX THE\nPASCAL PRINCIPLE? (AND WHY?)\n\nLocal isotropy of pressure (Pascal principle) is a common assumption in the\nstudy of self\u2013gravitating systems, whenever the fluid approximation is used\nto describe the matter distribution of the object. This Pascalian character\nof fluids is supported by large amount of observational evidence pointing\ntowards the equality of principal stresses under variety of circumstances.\nHowever strong theoretical evidence presented in the last decades by different\nauthors suggest that for certain density ranges, different kind of physical\nphenomena may take place, giving rise to local anisotropy (see [5]\u2013[7] for\ndetails and references). Among them we may mention:\n1. \"Exotic\" phase transition (e. g. pion condensate).\n9\n\n\f2. Magnetic fields.\n3. Type II superconductor.\n4. Type P superfluid.\n5. Boson stars.\n6. Viscosity.\n7. Anisotropic velocity distributions.\n8. Two fluid systems.\n9. Gravstars.\nBesides the physical causes that may produce local anisotropy, it is worth\nnoticing that General Relativity in some sense introduces an \"intrinsic\"\nanisotropy of pressure, by assigning different roles to radial (Pr ) and tangential pressure (P\u22a5 ). Indeed, let us take a look at eq.(14). Its physical\ninterpretation is quite simple. The first term on the left ( the gradient of\npressure) equals the gravitational \"force\" term plus a term produced by the\nanisotropy. Now, the amazing point is that the pressure which appears in the\ngravitational term is the radial pressure. In other words, tangential pressure\ndoes not produce any regenerative pressure effect. Thus, in principle, one\ncould obtain more massive configurations in equilibrium by increasing the\ntangential pressure, since the latter does not affects the gravitational term.\nFinally, the following question appears naturally: How do the properties\nof the locally anisotropic system differ from the locally isotropic one?\nAs it could be expected they differ in many ways. However there are two\nwhich deserve particular attention:\n1. Cracking induced by perturbations of local isotropy of pressure. The\nconcept of cracking was introduced in [8] to describe the behaviour of\nspherically symmetric fluid distributions just after their departure from\nequilibrium, when total nonvanishing radial forces of different signs appear within the system. We say that there is cracking whenever this\nradial force is directed inward in the inner part of the sphere and reverses its sign beyond some value of the radial coordinates (interior to\n10\n\n\fthe boundary of the fluid distribution). For the configurations considered in [8], it was shown that cracking will occur only if deviations from\nlocal isotropy are allowed. Furthermore in [9] it was shown that for a\nlarge class of fluid distributions, cracking would appear if only small\nr)\nrelative anisotropy is permitted ( (P\u22a5P\u2212P\n<< 1).\nr\nIt goes without saying that the appearance of cracking could drastically\naffect the evolution of the configuration.\n2. Changes in the total mass allowed for a compact object. From the\ncomments above about the role of radial and tangential pressure, and\nthe absence of a regenerative effect for the latter, it follows that the\ntotal mass allowed for a compact object would be seriously affected by\nthe presence of local anisotropy.\n\n5\n\nHOW DO ELECTRIC CHARGE AND DISSIPATION AFFECT THE EVOLUTION\nOF MASSIVE STARS?\n\nWe shall now illustrate the effects produced by dissipation and electric charge\nin the process of gravitational collapse. For this purpose we shall use the formalism developed by Misner and collaborators based in comoving coordinates\n[10], [11] (observe the change in notation and signature with respect to [4])).\nThus, let us consider a spherically symmetric distribution of collapsing\nfluid, bounded by a spherical surface \u03a3. The fluid is assumed to be locally\nanisotropic and undergoing dissipation in the form of heat flow (to model dissipation in the diffusion approximation), null radiation (to model dissipation\nin the free streaming approximation) and shearing viscosity.\nChoosing comoving coordinates inside \u03a3, the general interior metric can\nbe written\nds2 = \u2212A2 dt2 + B 2 dr 2 + R2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ),\n(20)\nwhere A, B and R are functions of t and r and are assumed positive. We\nnumber the coordinates x0 = t, x1 = r, x2 = \u03b8 and x3 = \u03c6.\nThe matter energy-momentum T\u03b1\u03b2 inside \u03a3 has the form\nT\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u03bc + P\u22a5 )V\u03b1 V\u03b2 + P\u22a5 g\u03b1\u03b2 + (Pr \u2212 P\u22a5 )\u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b2 + q\u03b1 V\u03b2 + V\u03b1 q\u03b2 + \u01ebl\u03b1 l\u03b2 \u2212 2\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(21)\n11\n\n\fwhere \u03bc is the energy density, Pr the radial pressure, P\u22a5 the tangential\npressure, q \u03b1 the heat flux, \u01eb the energy density of the null fluid describing\ndissipation in the free streaming approximation, \u03b7 the shear viscosity coefficient, V \u03b1 the four velocity of the fluid, \u03c7\u03b1 a unit four vector along the radial\ndirection and l\u03b1 a radial null four vector. These quantities satisfy\nV \u03b1 V\u03b1 = \u22121, V \u03b1 q\u03b1 = 0, \u03c7\u03b1 \u03c7\u03b1 = 1, \u03c7\u03b1 V\u03b1 = 0, l\u03b1 V\u03b1 = \u22121, l\u03b1 l\u03b1 = 0.\n(22)\nObserve that we have assumed the shear viscosity tensor \u03c0\u03b1\u03b2 to satisfy\nthe relation\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03b2 = \u22122\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n(23)\nwhere \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 is the shear tensor. However this last equation is valid only within\nthe context of the standard irreversible thermodynamics (see [12], [13] for\ndetails).\nIn a full causal picture of dissipative variables we should not assume (23).\nInstead, we should use the transport equation derived from the corresponding\ntheory (e.g. the M\u00fcller\u2013Israel\u2013Stewart theory [14]\u2013[15]). However for the\nsake of simplicity, in this work we shall restrict ourselves to the standard\nirreversible thermodynamics theory (only in what concerns shear viscosity,\nfor the heat flux we shall consider a causal theory).\nThe acceleration a\u03b1 and the expansion \u0398 of the fluid are given by\na\u03b1 = V\u03b1;\u03b2 V \u03b2 , \u0398 = V \u03b1 ;\u03b1 .\n\n(24)\n\n1\n\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 = V(\u03b1;\u03b2) + a(\u03b1 V\u03b2) \u2212 \u0398h\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n3\n\n(25)\n\nand its shear \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 by\n\nwhere h\u03b1\u03b2 = g\u03b1\u03b2 + V\u03b1 V\u03b2 .\nSince we are interested in the influence of electric charge too, we need to\ninclude the electromagnetic energy tensor and the Maxwell equations.\nThe former is given by\nE\u03b1\u03b2 =\n\n1\n1\nF\u03b1 \u03b3 F\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 F \u03b3\u03b4 F\u03b3\u03b4 g\u03b1\u03b2 ,\n4\u03c0\n4\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(26)\n\nwhere F\u03b1\u03b3 is the Maxwell tensor, which can be expressed through the four\nvector potential as\nF\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03c6\u03b2,\u03b1 \u2212 \u03c6\u03b1,\u03b2 .\n(27)\n12\n\n\fSince we are considering the charge to be comoving with the fluid, then there\nis no magnetic field, and the four density current is proportional to the four\nvelocity\n\u03c6\u03b1 = \u03a6\u03b4\u03b10 , J \u03b1 = \u03c2V \u03b1 ,\n(28)\nwhere \u03c2 denotes the charge density. Also it can be easily obtained that the\ntotal charge interior to a sphere labelled by coordinate r is independent on\ntime and given by,\nZ r\ns(r) = 4\u03c0\n\u03c2BR2 dr.\n(29)\n0\n\nFrom all the above we may write the Einstein\u2013Maxwell equations\nG\u03b1\u03b2 = 8\u03c0(T\u03b1\u03b2 + E\u03b1\u03b2 ),\n\n(30)\n\nF \u03b1\u03b2 ;\u03b2 = 4\u03c0J \u03b1 .\n\n(31)\n\nHowever we shall not need those equations explicitly, and therefore we\nshall not present them here.

(43) in\n[18]. Let us now analyze in some detail the three terms on the right of (39).\nThe first term on the right hand side of (39) represents the gravitational\nforce. The factor within the round bracket (the same factor as on the left of\n(39)) defines the inertial mass density (\"passive\" gravitational mass density)\nand shows how it is affected by dissipative terms. Observe that it is not\naffected by the electric charge.\nThe factor within the first square bracket shows how dissipation and the\nelectric charge affect the \"active\" gravitational mass term. Using (37) in (39)\nwe see that the charge will increase the \"active gravitational mass\" only if\nZ\n\nR\n\n0\n\ns2\ns2\ndR\n>\nR2\nR\n\n(41)\n\notherwise it will decrease it. In the case\nZ\n\n0\n\nR\n\ns2\ns2\ndR\n=\nR2\nR\n\n(42)\n\nno regenerative effect of charge occurs. This strange effect was already noticed by Bekenstein [18], and enhances the possibility that Coulomb repulsion\nmight prevent the gravitational collapse of the sphere.\nThere are three different contributions in the second square bracket. The\nfirst one is just the gradient of the total \"effective\" radial pressure (which\nincludes the radiation pressure and the influence of shear viscosity on Pr ).\nThe second contribution comes from the local anisotropy of pressure, including the contributions from the radiation pressure and shear viscosity. Finally\nthe last term describes Coulomb repulsion, which is always positive (always\nopposing gravitation). Observe that this repulsive effect is reinforced if the\ncharged distribution is such that (41) is violated, due to the ensuing decreasing of the \"active gravitational mass\" term.\nThe last square bracket contains different contributions due to dissipative\nprocesses. The third term within this bracket is positive (U < 0) showing that\nthe outflow of q > 0 and \u01eb > 0 diminish the total energy inside the collapsing\nsphere, thereby reducing the rate of collapse. The last term describes an\neffect resulting from the coupling of the dissipative flux with the shear of\nthe fluid. The effects of DT \u01eb have been discussed in detail in [19]. Thus it\nremains to analyse the effects of DT q; this depends on the transport equation\nadopted, and we will next proceed to study one case.\n15\n\n\f5.2\n\nCoupling the transport equation with the dynamical equation\n\nWe shall use a transport equation derived from the M\u00fcller-Israel-Stewart\nsecond order phenomenological theory for dissipative fluids [14, 15].\nIndeed, it is well known that the Maxwell-Fourier law for radiation flux\nleads to a parabolic equation (diffusion equation) which predicts propagation\nof perturbations with infinite speed (see [20]-[22] and references therein).\nThis simple fact is at the origin of the pathologies [23] found in the approaches of Eckart [24] and Landau [25] for relativistic dissipative processes.\nTo overcome such difficulties, various relativistic theories with non-vanishing\nrelaxation times have been proposed in the past [14, 15, 26, 27]. The important point is that all these theories provide a heat transport equation which\nis not of Maxwell-Fourier type but of Cattaneo type [28], leading thereby to\na hyperbolic equation for the propagation of thermal perturbations.\nThus we shall assume that our heat flux vector satisfies:\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03c4 h V q\u03b2;\u03b3\n\n1 2 \u03c4V \u03b2\n+ q = \u2212\u03bah (T,\u03b2 + T a\u03b2 ) \u2212 \u03baT\n2\n\u03baT 2\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\n!\n\nq\u03b1,\n\n(43)\n\n;\u03b2\n\nwhere \u03c4 denotes the relaxation time and \u03ba is the coefficient of thermal conductivity.\nThen, coupling (43) with (39) one obtains after some calculations (see\n[17] for details)\n4\n\u03bc + Pr + 2\u01eb \u2212 \u03c3\u03b7 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)DT U\n3\n\u03baE 2\nDR T\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b1)Fgrav + Fhyd +\n\u03c4 #\n\"\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03baT 2 q\n\u03c4\n+ E\n\u2212 DT \u01eb\nDT\n2\u03c4\n\u03baT 2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nU\n3\n1\n5U\n\u2212 2E\u01eb 2 + \u03c3 ,\n+ \u03c3\u2212\n\u2212 Eq\n2R 2\n\u03c4\nR\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nwith\nFgrav\n\n4\n= \u2212 \u03bc + Pr + 2\u01eb \u2212 \u03b7\u03c3\n3\n\u0012\n\n16\n\n\u0013\n\n(44)\n\n\fs2 1\n4\n,\n\u00d7 m + 4\u03c0 Pr + \u01eb \u2212 \u03b7\u03c3 R3 \u2212\n3\nR R2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4\n2\n= \u2212E DR Pr + \u01eb \u2212 \u03b7\u03c3\n3\n\u0015\n1\ns\n+ 2(Pr \u2212 P\u22a5 + \u01eb \u2212 2\u03b7\u03c3) \u2212\nDR s ,\nR 4\u03c0R4\n\"\n\nFhyd\n\n#\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nand\n\n(45)\n\n(46)\n\n\u22121\n4\n\u03baT\n\u03bc + Pr + 2\u01eb \u2212 \u03c3\u03b7\n.\n(47)\n\u03c4\n3\nThe first observation to make is that once the transport equation has been\ntaken into account, then the inertial energy density and the \"passive gravitational mass density\", i.e the factor multiplying DT U and the first factor at\nthe right of (45) respectively (which of course are the same, as expected from\nthe equivalence principle), appear diminished by the factor 1 \u2212 \u03b1, a result\nalready obtained, but here generalized by the inclusion of the viscosity and\nradiative phenomena (see [29]\u2013[30] and references therein). Also observe that\nthe charge does not enter into the definition of \u03b1. However it does affect the\n\"active gravitational mass\" (the factor within the square bracket in (45)).\nLet us now consider a system which starts to collapse. As far as the right\nhand side of (44) is negative, the system keeps collapsing. However, let us\nassume that the collapsing sphere evolves in such a way that, for some region\nof the sphere, the value of \u03b1 increases and approaches the critical value of\n1. Then, as this process goes on, the ensuing decreasing of the gravitational\nforce term would eventually lead to a change of the sign of the right hand side\nof (44). Since that would happen for small values of the effective inertial mass\ndensity, that would imply a strong bouncing of that part of the sphere, even\nfor a small absolute value of the right hand side of (44). Obviously for this\nscenario to occur, evolution should proceed in such a way that \u03b1 approaches\nthe critical value of 1. At present we may speculate that \u03b1 may increase\nsubstantially (for non-negligible values of \u03c4 ) in a pre-supernovae event.\nIndeed, at the last stages of massive star evolution, the decreasing of the\nopacity of the fluid, from very high values preventing the propagation of\nphotons and neutrinos [31], to smaller values, gives rise to neutrino radiative\nheat conduction. Under these conditions both \u03ba and T could be sufficiently\nlarge as to imply a substantial increase of \u03b1. In fact, the values suggested in\n[32] ([\u03ba] \u2248 1037 ; [T ] \u2248 1013 ; [\u03c4 ] \u2248 10\u22124 ; [\u03c1] \u2248 1012 , in c.g.s. units and Kelvin)\n\n\u03b1=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n17\n\n\flead to \u03b1 \u2248 1.\nA numerical model illustrating this effect has recently been presented.\n[33]\nBefore closing this section it is worth mentioning that the reported effect\n(the decreasing of the \"passive gravitational mass density term\" by a factor\n(1 \u2212 \u03b1), is related to the first term on the left and the T a\u03bc term, in (43). But\nthese terms have to be present in any causal theory of dissipation. Accordingly such an effect is also expected to hold for a general family of theories\nwhich includes the M\u00fcller-Israel-Stewart theory.\n\n6\n\nConclusions\n\nTo summarize:\n\u2022 Dissipative phenomena play a relevant role in the dynamics of collapse.\nIn particular, relaxational effects may drastically change the outcome\nof gravitational collapse.\n\u2022 The dynamical regime may be approached by means of successive approximations. Doing so, we are able to describe the evolution by solving\nordinary differential equations, instead of partial differential equations.\n\u2022 Local anisotropy of pressure has to be taken into consideration in the\nstudy of the structure and evolution of massive stars.\n\u2022 Not only the absolute value of electric charge but also its distribution\nmay be relevant in stellar structure and evolution.\n\nReferences\n[1] L.
