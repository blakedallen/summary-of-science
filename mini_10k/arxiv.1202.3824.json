I NTRODUCTION\nTraditionally security in wireless networks has been mainly considered at higher layers\nusing cryptographic methods. However, recent advances in wireless decentralized and ad-hoc\nnetworking have led to an increasing attention on studying physical layer based security. The\nbasic idea of physical layer security is to exploit the physical characteristics of the wireless\nchannel to provide secure communication. The security is quantified by the secrecy capacity,\nwhich is defined as the maximum rate of reliable information sent from the source to the\nintended destination in the presence of eavesdroppers. This line of work was pioneered by\nAaron Wyner, who introduced the wiretap channel and established fundamental results of\ncreating perfectly secure communications without relying on private keys [1]. Wyner showed\nthat when the eavesdropper channel is a degraded version of the main channel, the source\nand the destination can exchange perfectly secure messages at a non-zero rate. In follow-up\nwork [2], the secrecy capacity of Gaussian wiretap channel was studied, and in [3] Wyner's\napproach was extended to the transmission of confidential messages over broadcast channels.\nRecently, researches on physical layer security have generalized these studies to wireless\nfading channels [4]\u2013[7], MIMO channels [8]\u2013[12], and various multiple access scenarios\n[13]\u2013[18].\nMotivated the fact that if the source-wiretapper channel is less noisy than the sourcedestination channel, the perfect secrecy capacity will be zero [3], some recent work has\nbeen proposed to overcome this limitation using relay cooperation, which mainly consists of\ncooperative relaying [19], [20], and cooperative jamming [21], [22]. For instance, in [19] and\n[20], the authors proposed effective decode-and-forward (DF) and amplify-and-forward (AF)\nbased cooperative relaying protocols for physical layer security, respectively. Cooperative\njamming is another approach to improve the secrecy capacity by distracting the eavesdropper\nwith codewords independent of the source messages. In [21] and [22], several cooperative\njamming schemes were investigated for different scenarios, where classical relay strategies\nfail to offer positive performance gains. Relay channel with confidential messages was studied\nin [23] and [24], where the relay node acts both as an eavesdropper and a helper. In [25],\nit was established that cooperation even with an untrusted relay node could be beneficial\nin relay channels with orthogonal components. Then in [26], the authors considered a twohop communication system using an untrusted relay and showed that a cooperative jammer\nenables a positive secrecy capacity which would be otherwise impossible.\nTwo-way communication is a common scenario where two terminals transmit information\nto each other simultaneously. Recently, the two-way relay channel [27]\u2013[31] has attracted\nlots of interest from both academic and industrial communities due to its advantage in saving\n\n\f3\n\nbandwidth efficiently. In [27] and [28], both AF and DF protocols for one-way relay channels\nwere extended to general full-duplex discrete two-way relay channel and half-duplex Gaussian\ntwo-way relay channel, respectively. In [29], different relay strategies consisting of AF, DF,\nand EF (estimate-and-forword) for uncoded two-way relay channels were investigated. In [30],\nanalogue network coding based two-way relay channel with linear processing was analyzed\nand an optimal relay beamforming structure was presented. In [31], a joint network-channel\ncoding was proposed for the two-way relay channel, where channel codes are used at both\nthe sources and a network code is used at the intermediate relay. Although two-way relay\nnetworks have received so much attention so far, the security issue about the relay, especially\nfrom the physical layer security point of view, has not been well investigated.\nTo improve the security in two-way relay channel, distributed protocols are desired. Game\ntheory [32] offers a formal analytical framework with a set of mathematical tools to study\nthe complex interactions among interdependent rational players. Recently, there has been\nsignificant growth in research activities that use game theory for analyzing communication networks, mainly due to the need for developing autonomous, distributed, and flexible\nmobile networks where the network devices can make independent and rational strategic\ndecisions, as well as the need for low complexity distributed algorithms for competitive or\ncollaborative scenarios [33]. In [34] and [35], the authors introduced some recent studies\non signal processing and communication networks using game theory. In [36] and [37], the\nauthors employed game theory to physical layer security to study the interaction between the\nsource and the jammers who assist the source by distracting the eavesdropper, and got some\ndistributed game solutions. For two-way relay networks, it is desirable to study the physical\nlayer security problems with the aid of game theory similar to those for one-way relay cases.\nIn this paper, we investigate physical layer security issues in a two-way relay network with\nfriendly jammers. The two sources can exchange information only through an untrusted relay,\nas there is no direct communication link between them. The untrusted AF relay acts as both\nan essential relay and a malicious eavesdropper that has the incentive to eavesdrop on the\ninformation transmission. For convenience and ease of comparison, we first study the system\nwithout friendly jammers as a special case. We find that a non-zero secrecy rate here is\nindeed available even without the help of friendly jammers. We also derive an optimal power\nvector of the relay and the sources by maximizing the secrecy rate. We further investigate\nthe two-way relay secure communication with friendly jammers, and find that a positive gain\ncan be obtained in the secrecy rate by utilizing proper jamming power from the friendly\njammers. Then the problem comes to how to effectively utilize the jamming power from\ndifferent friendly jammers to maximize the secrecy rate. Thus, we propose a Stackelberg\n\n\f4\n\ngame model between the sources and the friendly jammers as a power control scheme. In the\ndefined game, the sources pay the friendly jammers for interfering the untrusted relay in order\nto increase the secrecy rate, while the friendly jammers charge the sources with a certain\nprice for their service of jamming. In addition, the optimal solutions of the jamming power\nand the asking prices are given and a distributed updating algorithm to obtain the Stakelberg\nequilibrium is provided for the proposed game. Furthermore, a centralized scheme is also\nproposed for comparison with the distributed Stackelberg game based scheme. Finally, the\nproposed approaches and solutions are verified by simulations.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system model of two-way\nrelay communication with friendly jammers is described and the corresponding secrecy rate\nis formulated. In Section III, a two-way relay system without jammers as a special case is\ninvestigated. In Section IV, we define a Stackelberg type of buyer/seller game to investigate\nthe interaction between the sources and the friendly jammers, and analyze the optimization\nproblem of physical layer security in the presence of friendly jammers. Simulation results\nare provided in Section V, and the conclusions are drawn in Section VI.\nII. S YSTEM M ODEL\nAs shown in Fig. 1, we consider a basic two-way relay network consisting of two source\nnodes, one untrusted relay node, and N friendly jammer nodes, which are denoted by Sk , k =\n1, 2, R, and Ji , i = 1, 2, . . . , N, respectively. We denote by N the set of indices {1, 2, . . . , N}.\nAll the nodes here are equipped with only a single omni-directional antenna and operate in\na half-duplex way, i.e., each node cannot receive and transmit simultaneously. Then the\ncomplete transmission can be divided into two phases. During the first phase, shown with\nsolid lines, both source nodes transmit their information to the relay node. Simultaneously, the\nfriendly jammers also transmit the jamming signals in order to distract the malicious relay. In\nthe second phase, shown with dashed lines, the relay node broadcasts a combined version of\nthe received signals to both source nodes. Note that in the system we investigate there is only\none intermediate relay and we assume that no direct link exists between the two sources.\nThus, the sole untrusted relay is necessary for the two-way relaying data transmission. A\nkey assumption\n1\n\n1\n\nwe make here is that the sources have perfect knowledge of the jamming\n\nWe can guarantee this by using some pseudo-random codes which are known to both the friendly jammers and the\n\nsources but not open to the malicious relay. Beyond this, we can also use some cryptographic signals at the friendly\njammers for jamming, where the decryption book is a secret key only open to the sources. Then the sources can have a\nperfect knowledge of the jamming signals if each jammer sends some additional bits consisting of the information of the\njamming signal transmitted (e.g., which code or which encryption method to be used). The information that needs to be\nsent is for one time, which will lead to trivial bandwidth cost.\n\n\f5\n\nsignals transmitted by the friendly jammers, for they have paid for the service.\nLet s1 , s2 , and sJi , i \u2208 N , denote the signal to be transmitted by the source S1 , S2 , and the\njammers Ji , i \u2208 N , respectively. Suppose source nodes S1 and S2 transmit with power p1\nand p2 , and the channel gains from the source nodes to the relay node are denoted by hSk ,R ,\nk = 1, 2. Each friendly jammer node i transmits with power pJi , and the channel gain from\nit to the relay node is denoted by hJi ,R , i \u2208 N . The channel gain contains the path loss and\nthe Rayleigh fading coefficient with zero mean and unit variance. For simplicity, we assume\nthat the fading coefficients are constant over one frame, and vary independently from one\nframe to another.\nIn phase 1, the received signal at the malicious relay can be expressed as\nXq\n\u221a\n\u221a\npJi sJi hJi ,R ,\nyr = nr + p1 s1 hS1 ,R + p2 s2 hS2 ,R +\n\n(1)\n\ni\n\nwhere nr denotes the thermal noise at the relay node R, which is a zero mean Gaussian\nrandom variable with two sided power spectral density of \u03c3 2 , i.e., CN (0, \u03c3 2 ). Furthermore,\nwe assume that the noises at S1 , S2 , and R are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\nIn phase 2, the malicious relay, which works in AF mode, amplifies the received signal\nyr by a factor \u03b2 and then broadcasts the signal to both S1 and S2 with power pr .

Actually, the untrusted\nrelay has the incentive to forward the signals from both the sources since it can eavesdrop on\nthe information transmission through this kind of cooperation. If the relay is non-cooperative\nthat it only receives but not relays the information, then the problem comes to deny-of-service\nattack. However, this can be easily detected by the sources, then the non-cooperative relay\nwill be treated as a thorough eavesdropper and lose the good opportunity to eavesdrop on\nthe information transmission. The sources will then turn to another intermediate relay for\nhelp to relay their information in a practical scenario where there exist multiple intermediate\nrelays. In this paper, we focus on the studies how to prevent the untrusted but necessary\nintermediate relay from eavesdropping the information, and thus, for simplicity and without\nloss of generality, we assume that there is only one necessary intermediate relay in the system\nand the relay is cooperative.\nIII. S ECRECY R ATE\n\nOF\n\nT WO -WAY R ELAY C HANNEL W ITHOUT JAMMERS\n\nFor comparison and consistence, we first investigate the special case without the presence\nof jammers in this section. We prove that there indeed exists a positive secrecy rate for the\ntwo-way relay channel even without the help of friendly jammers distracting the malicious\nrelay. Furthermore, we also obtain an optimal power allocation of the sources and the relay\nto maximize the secrecy rate. In the next section, we will compare the case with friendly\njammers with this case to expect a positive performance gain in the secrecy rate.\n\n\f8\n\nA. Existence of Non-zero Secrecy Rate\nWhen the eavesdropper channels from the two sources to the malicious relay are degraded\nversions of the equivalent main two-way relay channel between S1 and S2 , the two sources can\nexchange perfectly secure messages at a non-zero rate. Firstly, we consider the transmission\nfrom S1 to S2 . In phase 1, the malicious relay receives the signal s1 from S1 , which consists of\nthe information for S2 . Meanwhile, S2 also transmits the signal s2 at the relay, which acts as\nboth the information carrier for S1 and a jamming signal that makes the eavesdropper channel\nfrom S1 to the malicious relay getting worse. In phase 2, the combined signal consisting of\ns1 and s2 arrives at S2 . As S2 has a perfect knowledge of its own signal s2 , the signal that\njammed the malicious relay in phase 1 has no such an effect on S2 . Therefore, it makes\npossible that the eavesdropper channel is worse than the data transmission channel from S1\nto S2 , which means that a non-zero rate for secure communication from S1 to S2 is available.\nIt is the same situation in the transmission from S2 to S1 . From (15), (16) and the expressions\nof K1 in (10) and K2 in (8), we can write the probability of the existence of a non-zero\nsecrecy rate as\n\u0010\n\u0011\nP C\u03031s > 0, C\u03032s > 0 = P (K1 < p2 gS2 ,R , K2 < p1 gS1 ,R )\n)!\n(\nT\nT\n,\n,\n= P pr > max\np2 gS2 2 ,R p1 gS2 1 ,R\n\n(17)\n\nwhere T = (p1 gS1 ,R + p2 gS2 ,R + \u03c3 2 )\u03c3 2 .\nConsidering the power constraints p1 \u2264 pmax , p2 \u2264 pmax , and pr \u2264 pmax , we can get that\no\nn\n, under\nthere exists at least one pair of (pr , p1 , p2 ) that satisfies pr > max p2 gT2 , p1 gT2\nS2 ,R\nS1 ,R \u0011\n\u0010\ng\n+g\nthe channel condition of gSS1 ,R,R gSS2,R,R < pmax\n. Therefore, we have P C\u03031s > 0, C\u03032s > 0 > 0 at\n\u03c32\n1\n\n2\n\nsome power vectors of (pr , p1 , p2 ), which actually indicates that a non-zero secrecy rate in\nthe two-way relay channel is indeed available.\nB. Maximizing the Secrecy Rate\n\nIn this subsection, we try to get an optimal power vector of (pr , p1 , p2 ) which maximizes\nthe secrecy rate of the two-way relay channel. We can formulate the problem subject to the\nindividual secrecy rate constraints and power constraints as\nmax C\u0303 s = max\n\n2\nX\n\nC\u0303ks ,\n\nk=1\n\ns.t.\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 C\u0303 s > 0, C\u0303 s > 0\n1\n2\n.\n\uf8f3 p1 \u2264 pmax , p2 \u2264 pmax , pr \u2264 pmax\n\n(18)\n\n\f9\n\nFrom (17), we have that\nC\u03031s > 0, C\u03032s > 0 \u21d4 pr > max\n\n(\n\nT\nT\n,\n2\np2 gS2 ,R p1 gS2 1 ,R\n\n)\n\n.\n\n(19)\n\nFrom (15), (16), and (18), we can get that\n\u0011+\nW\u0010\ns\nC\u0303 =\nlog F\u0303 (pr , p1 , p2 ) ,\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwhere\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\u0010\n1+\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\nF\u0303 (pr , p1 , p2 ) ,\np1 gS1 ,R\n1 + \u03c32 +p\n1+\n2 gS ,R\n1+\n\np1 gS1 ,R\n\u03c32 +K1\n\n2\n\np2 gS2 ,R\n\u03c32 +K2\n\n\u0011\n\np2 gS2 ,R\n\u03c32 +p1 gS1 ,R\n\n\u0011.\n\n(21)\n\nAs F\u0303 (pr , p1 , p2 ) has the same monotonic property as C\u0303 s under the conditions of (18), we\ncan transform the optimization problem as\n\ns.t.\nIt can be calculated that\n\nmax F\u0303 (pr , p1 , p2 ) ,\n\uf8f1\nn\nT\n\uf8f2 pr > max\n, p1 gT2\np2 g 2\nS2 ,R\n\n(22)\n\nS1 ,R\n\no\n\n.\n\n\uf8f3 p \u2264p , p \u2264p , p \u2264p\n1\nmax\n2\nmax\nr\nmax\n\n\u2202 F\u0303 (pr ,p1 ,p2 )\n\u2202pr\n\n> 0 is always established under the conditions of (22),\n\nwhich implies that F\u0303 (pr , p1 , p2 ) is a monotonically increasing function of pr . Therefore,\nwhen maximizing the secrecy rate C\u0303 s , pr\n\nopt\n\n= pmax , where pr\n\nopt\n\ndenotes the optimal relay\n\npower 3 . As a result, the problem can be further transformed into max F\u0303 (pmax , p1 , p2 ).\nThe optimal solutions of p1 and p2 when maximizing the secrecy rate can be easily obtained\nunder different conditions (i.e., gS1 ,R > gS2 ,R , gS1 ,R < gS2 ,R , and gS1 ,R = gS2 ,R ) through the\nLagrangian method by solving the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions [43]. In this paper,\nsubject to the space limit, we omit the detailed computing process and only give the results\nof the optimal solutions of p1 and p2 as:\n1) For the case that gS1 ,R > gS2 ,R , it yields that p2\n\nopt\n\na solution p\u22171 \u2208 (0, pmax ] that satisfies the equation\np1\n\nopt\n\n= p\u22171 . Otherwise, we have p1\n\nopt\n\n= pmax . Meanwhile, if there exists\n\u2202 F\u0303 (pmax ,p1 ,pmax )\n\u2202p1\n\n= pmax . Here p1\n\nopt\n\nand p2\n\nopt\n\n= 0, then we have\ndenote the optimal\n\npower transmitted by S1 and S2 , respectively.\n2) For the case that gS1 ,R < gS2 ,R , it yields that p1\n\nopt\n\na solution p\u22172 \u2208 (0, pmax ] that satisfies the equation\np2\n\nopt\n\n= p\u22172 . Otherwise, we have p2\n\nopt\n\n\u2202 F\u0303 (pmax ,pmax ,p2 )\n\u2202p2\n\n= 0, then we have\n\n= pmax , and p2\n\nopt\n\n= pmax .\n\n3) For the case that gS1 ,R = gS2 ,R , we have that p1\n3\n\n= pmax . Meanwhile, if there exists\n\nopt\n\n= pmax .\n\nNote that here we calculate the optimal power solution of pr only from a mathematical perspective to maximize the\n\nsecrecy rate. In fact, the intermediate relay has no incentive to transmit with the maximum power.\n\n\f10\n\nIn addition, we verify these optimal solutions by simulations in different cases which is\nshown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 in Section-V, and after further calculation based on the simulation\nresults, we can get that the results agree with the optimal power solutions well.\nIV. P HYSICAL L AYER S ECURITY\n\nWITH\n\nF RIENDLY JAMMERS\n\nIn this section, through further analysis, we first find that the secrecy rate of the sources can\nbe effectively improved by utilizing proper jamming power from the friendly jammers. Then,\nthe problem comes to how to control the jamming power from different friendly jammers\nwhen optimizing the secrecy rate of the sources. In general, in a cooperative wireless network\nwith selfish nodes, nodes may not serve a common goal or belong to a single authority. Thus,\na mechanism of reimbursement to the friendly jammers should be employed such that the\nfriendly jammers can earn benefits from spending their own transmitting power in helping the\nsources for secure data transmission. For the source side, the sources aim to achieve the best\nperformance of secrecy rate with the friendly jammers' help with the least reimbursements\nto them. For the friendly jammer side, each friendly jammer aims to earn the payment not\nonly covers its transmitting cost but also gains as many extra profits as possible. Therefore,\nwe employ a Stackelberg game model [32] as a power control scheme jointly considering\nboth the benefits of the sources and the friendly jammers. In the Stackelberg game model we\nproposed, the two sources as a unity is the sole buyer that starts the process of the proposed\nStackelberg game, and the friendly jammers are the sellers, therefore, the sources are treated\nas leader while the friendly jammers are the followers. Furthermore, the optimal solutions of\nthe jamming power and asking price are investigated and a corresponding distributed updating\nalgorithm is provided. Finally, a centralized scheme is proposed for performance comparison.\nA. Secrecy Rate Improvement using Friendly Jammers\nFrom (13) and (14), we have\nC1s =\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\np1 gS1 ,R\nW \uf8ef \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f0log \uf8ed1 +\n\uf8f8\n2g\nP\n\u03c3\nJ\n,R\nJ\ni\n2\n\u03c3 2 + K1 +\np\ni\npr gS ,R\ni\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212 log \uf8ed1 +\n\n2\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9+\n\np1 gS1 ,R\n\uf8f8\uf8fb ,\nP\n\u03c3 2 + p2 gS2 ,R + gJi,R pJi\ni\n\n(23)\n\n\f11\n\nand\nC2s =\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nW \uf8ef \uf8ec\np2 gS2 ,R\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f0log \uf8ed1 +\n2g\nP\n\u03c3\nJi ,R J\n2\np\n\u03c3 2 + K2 +\npr gS ,R i\ni\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u2212 log \uf8ed1 +\n\n\u03c32\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\uf8f9+\n\np2 gS2 ,R\n\uf8f8\uf8fb .\nP\n+ p1 gS1 ,R + gJi,R pJi\n\n(24)\n\ni\n\nFrom (23) and (24), we can see that both Ck and Ckm , k = 1, 2, are decreasing and convex\nfunctions of jamming power pJi , i \u2208 N . However, if Ckm decreases faster than Ck as the\njamming power pJi increases, Cks might increase in some region of value pJi . But when pJi\n\nfurther increases, both Ck and Ckm will approach zero. As a result, Cks approaches zero.\nCompared to (15) and (16), we can get that if\ni.e.,\n\n\u03c32\npr\n\n\u03c32 gJi ,R\npr gS2 ,R\n\n< gJi ,R and\n\n\u03c32 gJi ,R\npr gS1 ,R\n\n< gJi ,R , \u2200i \u2208 N ,\n\n< min {gS1 ,R , gS2 ,R }, the gain of the secrecy rate will be above zero in some region\n\nof the jamming power pJi . Then the problem comes to how to utilize the jamming power\n\nfrom different friendly jammers effectively to maximize the secrecy rate. Thus, we propose\na Stackelberg game model to achieve effective jamming power control in the following\nsubsections.\nNote that synchronization among the sources and the friendly jammers is important in\nthe investigated system with friendly jammers. Many works have been devoted to the synchronization issues among distributed nodes in cooperative networks, for example in [44],\n[45], effective synchronization schemes among distributed sensors and cooperative relays\nwith low complexity and good performance were proposed. Thus, the synchronization issue\namong the sources and the friendly jammers can be addressed effectively using methods\nsimilar to those proposed in [44], [45]. However, this is not the key investigated issue in this\npaper, therefore, we assume that perfect synchronization among the sources and the friendly\njammers is implemented in the system.\nB. Source Side Game\nWe consider the two sources as two buyers who want to optimize their secrecy rates, while\nthe cost paid for the \"service\", i.e., jamming power pJi , i \u2208 N , should also be taken into\nconsideration. For the source side we can define the utility function as\nUs = a (C1s + C2s ) \u2212 M,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere a is a positive constant representing the economic gain per unit rate of confidential\ndata transmission between the two sources, and M is the cost to pay for the friendly jammers.\n\n\f12\n\nHere we have\nM=\n\nX\n\nmi pJi ,\n\n(26)\n\ni\u2208N\n\nwhere mi is the price per unit power paid for the friendly jammer i by the sources, i \u2208 N .\nWhen considering the optimal transmitting power vector of source S1 and S2 , i.e., (p1 , p2 )\nto achieve the maximum utility value in (25), we can treat the jamming power pJi , i \u2208 N , as\nconstants since all the nodes transmit with independent power. Thus, we can obtain similar\nresults of optimal power solutions as given in Subsection-III-B. But to obtain the optimal\nsolutions of p1 and p2 is not our main purpose here. In this subsection, we formulate the\nsource side game to study how to effectively utilize the jamming power from different friendly\njammers in order to achieve the maximum utility value.\nThen the source side game can be expressed as\n\ns.t.\n\nmax Us = max (a (C1s + C2s ) \u2212 M ) ,\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 C s \u2265 0, C s \u2265 0\n1\n2\n.\n\uf8f3 0 \u2264 pJ \u2264 pmax , pr = pmax , f ixed p1 , p2\n\n(27)\n\ni\n\nThe goal of the sources as buyers is to buy the optimal amount of power from the friendly\njammers in order to maximize the secrecy rate.

Actually, what to our particular interest are not the closed-form expressions of the\noptimal jamming power, but the parameters that affect these optimal solutions. Thus, the\noptimal jamming power solution can be expressed as\n\u0010\n\b\nJ\u2217\nJ\u2217\npi = pi mi , {Ak } , {Bk } , {Tk,i } , {Lk,i } , pJj\n\nj6=i\n\n\u0011\n\n,\n\n(31)\n\nwhich is a function of the friendly jammer's price mi , the other jammers' jamming power\n\b J\npj j6=i , and other system parameters. Noting that there may be up to eight roots of the\npolynomial equation (30), the selected solution should be a real root and can lead to a higher\nvalue of Us in (28) than the other real ones. Subject to the power constraints 0 \u2264 pJi \u2264 pmax\nin the game, we can get the optimal strategy as\n\u0001\n\u2217 \u0001\npJi opt = min max pJi , 0 , pmax .\n\n(32)\n\nIf there are no real roots of the equation (30), then the optimal strategy will be either pJi opt = 0\nor pJi opt = pmax according to which one can achieve a larger Us when other parameters are\nsettled.\nBecause of the high complexity of the solutions to the high order equation in (31), we\nfurther consider a special high interference case to obtain a simple expression of the optimal\nsolution. In this special case, we assume that there is one jammer staying very close to the\nmalicious relay, so that the interference from the jammer is much stronger than the power of\nthe received signals from the sources at the relay. Meanwhile, we also assume that the received\nsignal power is much higher than the additive noise, i.e., high signal-to-noise ratio, which\nmeans \u03c3 2 \u226a p1 gS1 ,R \u226a pJ1 gJ1 ,R and \u03c3 2 \u226a p2 gS2 ,R \u226a pJ1 gJ1 ,R . Then, we have\n\u03c32\n\np2 gS2 ,R\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n\u03c32\n\npJ\n1 gJ1 ,R\n\n\u226a 1,\n\np1 gS1 ,R\npJ\n1 gJ1 ,R\n\n\u226a 1, and\n\np1 gS1 ,R\npJ\n1 gJ1 ,R\n\n\u03c32\np1 gS1 ,R\n\n\u226a 1,\n\n\u226a 1. We assume all the left sides of these\n\ninequalities which are much smaller than 1 approach zero. Therefore, the utility function of\n\n\f14\n\nthe source side in (25) can be approximately calculated as\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\npr p1 gS1 ,R gS2 ,R\np1 gS1 ,R\naW\nlog 1 +\n\u2212 log 1 + J\nUs \u2248\n2\n\u03c3 2 pJ1 gJ1 ,R\np1 gJ1 ,R\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012\np2 gS2 ,R\npr p2 gS1 ,R gS2 ,R\n\u2212 log 1 + J\n\u2212 m1 pJ1\n+ log 1 +\n\u03c3 2 pJ1 gJ1 ,R\np1 gJ1 ,R\n\u0013\n\u0012\naW pr p1 gS1 ,R gS2 ,R p1 gS1 ,R pr p2 gS1 ,R gS2 ,R p2 gS2 ,R\n\u2248\n\u2212 J\n+\n\u2212 J\n\u2212 m1 pJ1\n2\n\u03c3 2 pJ1 gJ1,R\np1 gJ1 ,R\n\u03c3 2 pJ1 gJ1 ,R\np1 gJ1 ,R\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011p g\n\u0011p g\n\u0010p g\naW \u0010 pr gS2 ,R\n1\n1 S1 ,R\nr S1 ,R\n2 S2 ,R\n=\n\u2212 m1 pJ1\n\u2212\n1\n+\n\u2212\n1\nJ\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3\ngJ1,R\n\u03c3\ngJ1 ,R\np1\n1\n= \u2212 D1 J \u2212 m1 pJ1 ,\n(33)\np1\nh\ni\npr gS2 ,R \u0001 p1 gS1 ,R\npr gS1 ,R \u0001 p2 gS2 ,R\naW\nwhere D1 = 2\n1 \u2212 \u03c32\n+ 1 \u2212 \u03c32\nand the second approximation\ngJ ,R\ngJ ,R\n1\n\n1\n\ncomes from the Taylor series expansion log (1 + x) \u2248 x when x is small enough 4 . It can\n\nbe easily observed that if D1 < 0, Us is a decreasing function of pJ1 . As a result, Us can be\noptimized when pJ1 = 0, i.e., the jammer would not play in the game. If D1 > 0, in order to\nfind the optimal power for the sources to buy, we can calculate\n\nD1\n\u2202Us\n=\n2 \u2212 m1 = 0.\nJ\n\u2202p1\n(pJ1 )\nHence, the optimal closed-form solution can be expressed as\nr\nD1\nJ\u2217\np1 =\n.\nm1\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n\n\u2217\n\nBy comparing pJ1 with the power under the boundary conditions, we can obtain the optimal\n\nsolution of the source side game for this special case as\npJ1\n\nopt\n\n\u0001\n\u2217\n= min pJ1 , pmax .\n\n(36)\n\nIn Section-V, we employ the general case setups for simulation. The results indicates that\nthe sources always prefer to buying power from only one jammer when there exists at least\none sufficiently-effective jammer, which is more effective to perform jamming than the other\njammers and is simultaneously asking for a proper price. Therefore, this special case with one\njammer experiencing severe interference is valid in analyzing the proposed game. Under this\nspecial case, we can get a property of the proposed game that the optimal power consumption\n\u2217\n\npJ1 is a monotonous function of its price m1 , which could help to prove the existence of\nthe equilibrium in Subsection-IV-D. We can also prove that the friendly jammer power pJ1\n\n\u2217\n\nbought from the sources is convex in the price m1 under some conditions.\n\u2217\n\nFrom (35), we have the first order derivative of pJ1 as\n\u2217\n1p\n\u2202pJ1\n\u22123\n=\u2212\nD1 m1 2 ,\n\u2202m1\n2\n4\n\nHere we say x is small enough means the high order of x approaches zero.\n\n(37)\n\n\f15\n\nand the second order derivative as\n\u2217\n\n3p\n\u2202 2 pJ1\n\u22125\n=\nD1 m1 2 > 0,\n\u2202m1\n4\n\n(38)\n\u2217\n\nwhich indicates in the high interference case, the optimal power pJ1 is a convex function of\nthe price m1 .\nC. Friendly Jammer Side Game\nFor each friendly jammer, we can define the utility function as\nUi = mi pJi\n\n\u0001ci\n\n,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere ci \u2265 1 is a constant to balance the payment mi pJi from the sources and the transmission\n\ncost pJi of the jammer itself, i \u2208 N . With different values of ci , the jammers have different\n\nstrategies for asking the price mi . Here, the jamming power pJi is also a function of the\nvector of prices (m1 , m2 , . . . , mN ), as the amount of jamming power that the sources will\nbuy also depends on the prices that the friendly jammers ask. Hence, the friendly jammer\nside game can be expressed as\nmax Ui .\n\n(40)\n\nmi\n\nThe goal of each friendly jammer as a seller is to set an optimal price in order to maximize\nits utility. By differentiating the utility in (39) and setting it to zero, we can get\n\u0001ci\n\u0001ci \u22121 \u2202pJi opt\n\u2202Ui\n= pJi opt + mi ci pJi opt\n= 0,\n\u2202mi\n\u2202mi\n\n(41)\n\nwhich is equivalent to solve\n\npJi opt\n\n\u0001ci\u22121\n\n\u2202pJi opt\npJi opt + mi ci\n\u2202mi\n\n!\n\n= 0.\n\n(42)\n\nThe equation (42) can be solved by setting either pJi opt = 0 or\npJi opt + mi ci\n\n\u2202pJi opt\n= 0.\n\u2202mi\n\n(43)\n\nHence, with the optimal solution pJi opt , we can get the solution of the optimal price mi\n\nopt\n\nas a function given as\nmi\nwhere mi\n\nopt\n\ngame, i \u2208 N .\n\nopt\n\n\b\n= m\u2217i \u03c3 2 , gS1,R , gS2 ,R , {gJi,R } ,\n\n(44)\n\nshould be positive; otherwise, the friendly jammer would not participate the\n\n\f16\n\nD. Stackelberg Equilibrium of the Proposed Game\nIn this subsection, we investigate the Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game, at\nwhich neither the sources nor each friendly jammer can further improve its utility by changing\nits own strategy only. From the game definitions of the source side in (27) and the friendly\njammer side in (40), we can define the Stackelberg equilibrium as follows:\nDefinition 1: pJi SE and mi\n\nSE\n\nare the Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game, if\n\nwhen mi is fixed,\nUs\nand when pJi is fixed,\n\n\b J\n\u0001\npi SE =\nUi (mi\n\nUs\nsup\n0\u2264{pJ\ni }\u2264pmax ,\u2200i\n\nSE )\n\n\b J \u0001\npi , \u2200i \u2208 N ,\n\n= sup Ui (mi ) , \u2200i \u2208 N .\n\n(46)\n\nmi\n\n\b\nFrom the analysis in the previous two subsections, we have that pJi opt\n\n{mi opt }N\ni=1\n\n(45)\n\nN\ni=1\n\nin (32) and\n\nin (44) are the optimal solutions of the jamming power needed by the sources\n\nand the asking prices given by the friendly jammers when solving the utility optimization\n\b\nN\nproblem in (27) and (40). And thus, we can obtain the property that the pair of pJi opt i=1\n\nand {mi\n\nN\nopt }i=1\n\nis the Stackelberg equilibrium of the proposed game.\n\nWe can easily prove this property theoretically in the special high interference case with\none efficient friendly jammer close to the untrusted relay. In Subsection-IV-B, we have proved\nthat in this special case, the optimal jamming power solution pJ1\n\nopt\n\nbought from the efficient\n\nfriendly jammer 1 is monotone decreasing and convex with the asking price m1 , when the\nother friendly jammers' prices are fixed. And in this case, the sources would prefer to buy the\njamming power only from the efficient friendly jammer. Therefore, we can obtain that there\nexists a unique Stackelberg equilibrium that are just the optimal solutions of the jamming\npower and the asking prices. However, due to the extremely complex closed-form expressions\nof the optimal solutions, for more general cases, the proof in theory is intractable, and thus\ninstead, we prove by simulations in Section-V that the proposed game can effectively converge\nto a unique Stackelberg equilibrium, which are the optimal solutions of the jamming power\nand the asking price when maximizing the utilities of the sources and the friendly jammers.\nE. Distributed Updating Algorithm\nIn this subsection, we construct a corresponding distributed updating algorithm for the\nproposed game to converge to the Stackelberg equilibrium defined above. By rearranging\n(43), we have\nmi = Ii (m) = \u2212\n\npJi opt\nci\n\n\u0001\n\n\u2202pJ\ni opt\n\u2202mi\n\n,\n\n(47)\n\n\f17\n\nwhere m = [m1 , m2 , . . . , mN ]T , pJi opt is a function of m, and Ii (m) is the price update\nfunction for friendly jammer i, i \u2208 N . The information for updating can be obtained from\nthe sources, which is similar to the distributed power allocation [40]. The distributed algorithm\ncan be expressed in a vector form as\nm (t + 1) = I (m (t)) ,\n\n(48)\n\nwhere I = [I1 , I2 , ..., IN ]T , and the iteration is from time t to time t + 1.\nFurthermore, we can get the convergence of the proposed scheme by proving that the\nupdate function in (48) is a standard function [41] defined as\nDefinition 2: A function I (m) is standard, if for all m \u2265 0, the following properties are\nsatisfied\n1) Positivity: I (m) \u2265 0,\n\n2) Monotonicity: if m \u2265 m\u2032 , then I (m) \u2265 I (m\u2032 ), or I (m) \u2264 I (m\u2032 ),\n3) Scalability: For all \u03b7 > 1, \u03b7I (m) \u2265 I (\u03b7m).\nSimilarly as the situation in [41], we can get that each friendly jammer's price will converge\nto a fixed point, i.e., the Stackelberg equilibrium in our game, from any feasible initial\nprice vector m (0). The positivity of the update function is easy to prove. We know that if\nthe price mi goes up, the sources would buy less from the friendly jammer i. Therefore,\n\u2202pJ\ni opt\n\u2202mi\n\nin (47) is negative, and we can prove the positivity of the price update function as\n(p J )\nIi (m) = \u2212 \u2202pi Jopt > 0, \u2200i \u2208 N .\nci\n\ni opt\n\u2202mi\n\nBecause of the complexity of the optimal solutions in (32) and (44), the monotonicity and\nscalability can only be shown in the high interference case. From (35) and (47), we have the\nupdate function as\nI1 (m) =\n\n\u2217\npJ1\n\u2212 \u2202pJ \u2217\nc1 \u2202m1 1\n\n\u0001\n\n=\u2212\n\nq\n\n\u221a\nc1\n\n\u22122\n\nD1\nm1\n\u2212 32\n\nD1 m1\n\n=\n\n2m1\n,\nc1\n\n(49)\n\nwhich is monotonically increasing with the price m1 and scalable.\nFor more general cases, the analysis is intractable. But in Section-V, we employ the general\ncase setups for simulation and the results show that the proposed distributed game scheme\ncan converge and outperform the case without jammers.\nF. Centralized Scheme for Comparison\nTraditionally, the centralized scheme is employed assuming that all the channel information\nis known. In this subsection, we formulate the centralized problem by optimizing the secrecy\n\n\f18\n\nrate with respect to the constraints of maximal jamming power pmax .\nmax C s = max (C1s + C2s ) ,\npJ\ni\n\npJ\ni\n\n(50)\n\ns.t. 0 \u2264 pJi \u2264 pmax , \u2200i \u2208 N ,\nwhere C1s and C2s are obtained from (23) and (24), respectively. The centralized solution is\nfound by maximizing the secrecy rate only.\nIn Section-V, we compare the proposed distributed algorithm with this centralized scheme.\nFrom the simulation results, we can see that the distributed solution and the centralized\nsolution are asymptotically the same when the unit rate's gain a in (27) is sufficiently large.\nHowever, the distributed solution only needs to update the difference of the power and price\nto be adaptive, while the centralized solution requires all channel information in each time\nslot. Therefore, the distributed algorithm is more efficient in practical applications.\nV. S IMULATION R ESULTS\nTo investigate the performances, we conduct the following simulations. For simplicity and\nwithout loss of generality, we consider a two-way relay system where the sources S1 , S2 , and\nthe malicious relay R are located at the coordinate (\u22121, 0), (1, 0), and (0, 0), respectively.\nThe other simulation parameters are set up as follows: The maximum power constraint pmax\nis 10; the transmission bandwidth is 1; the noise variance is \u03c3 2 = 0.01; Rayleigh fading\nchannel is assumed, where the channel gain consists of the path loss and the Rayleigh fading\ncoefficient; the path loss factor is 2. Here, we select a = 1 for the source side utility in (27).\nFor the special case without jammers, we set the jamming power up to zero. In Fig. 2 and\nFig. 3, we show the secrecy rate as a function of the two sources' transmitting power p1 and\np2 in this special case. It shows that the optimal power vector of (p1 , p2 ) is (0.22pmax , pmax )\nwhen gS1 ,R = 0.3857 and gS2 ,R = 0.0443, and (pmax , 0.32pmax ) when gS1 ,R = 0.0508 and\ngS2 ,R = 0.3018. After further calculation, we can see that the results agree with the optimal\npower allocation conclusions given in Section III.\nFor the single-jammer case, we consider two jammer locations which are (0.3, 0.4) and\n(0.6, 0.8). Fig. 4 shows the secrecy rate as a function of the jamming power when p1 , p2 ,\nand pr are all set up to pmax . We can see that with the increase of the jamming power, the\nsecrecy rate first increases and then decreases. There indeed exists an optimal point for the\njamming power. Also the optimal point depends on the location of the friendly jammer, and\nwe can find that the friendly jammer close to the malicious relay is more effective to improve\nthe secrecy rate. Fig. 5 shows that the optimal amount of the jamming power bought by the\nsources depends on the price requested by the friendly jammer. We can see that the amount\n\n\f19\n\nof bought power gets reduced if the price goes high and the sources would even stop buying\nafter some price point. And thus there is a tradeoff for the jammers to set the price. If the\nprice is set too high, the sources would buy less power or even stop buying.\nFor the multiple-jammer case, we consider two jammers which are located at (0.3, 0.4)\nand (0.5, 0.5), respectively. Note that in the simulations of this scenario the jammers are both\nsufficiently-effective ones. Here we define jammer i as a sufficiently-effective one if it on\nits own can offer a power pJi , pJi \u2208 (0, pmax ], making the secrecy rate improved up to the\nmaximal value. In Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Fig. 9, the secrecy rate Cs , the sources' utility Us ,\nthe first jammer's utility U1 , and the second jammer's utility U2 as functions of both jammers'\nprices are shown, respectively. In Fig. 6, we can see that there exists an upper bound and\na lower bound for the secrecy rate when the channel conditions are settled. When one of\nthe two jammers' prices is low enough, the sources could buy sufficient jamming power\nfrom the jammer to improve the secrecy rate up to the upper bound. When both jammers'\nprices are beyond the sources' payment ability, the secrecy rate would stay at the lower\nbound which is the same as the case without jammers as the sources no longer buy jamming\npower from the jammers. In Fig. 7, we can see that if at least one of the two jammers sets\na low price, the sources' utility is high as the sources could get a high secrecy rate at a\nlow cost from the jammer with low asking price. With both jammers' prices going high,\nthe sources' utility decreases. When the prices of both jammers are so high that the sources\ncannot benefit any more from the jamming service at the high cost, the sources would stop\nbuying. In Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we can find that under this condition (i.e., both of the jammers\nare sufficiently-effective ones) the sources would always prefer to buying service from only\none of the friendly jammers for the best performance. The selected jammer is either more\neffective to improve the secrecy rate when the prices of the jammers are comparable, or the\none whose asking price is low enough. For the friendly jammer side, if the jammer asks\ntoo low price, the jammer's utility is very low. But if the jammer asks too high price, the\nsources might buy the service from the other friendly jammer. Therefore, there is an optimal\nprice for each friendly jammer to ask, and the sources would always select the one which\ncan provide the best performance improvement.\nFor the multiple-jammer case, we also discuss how the optimal secrecy rate changes with\nthe number of jammers increasing. We conduct simulations under two different scenarios,\ni.e., there exists at least one sufficiently-effective jammer and there is no sufficiently-effective\njammer. Here no sufficiently-effective jammer means that the sources could not achieve the\nmaximal secrecy rate with only one jammer's help. Therefore, the sources have to first sort\nthe current friendly jammers in an order of effectiveness, and then buy jamming power from\n\n\f20\n\nthe most effective jammer one by one until the secrecy rate reaches the maximal value. From\n(23) and (24), we can get that if the channel information and the transmitting power of the\nsources and the relay are settled, the maximal achievable secrecy rate will not change, no\nmatter how many jammers are used and how much jamming power bought by the sources\nfrom each jammer. For the non-sufficiently-effective jammer scenario, we set the jammer i\nlocated at (xi , yi ), i \u2208 N , where x2i +yi2 > 4. In Fig. 10, the optimal secrecy rate as a function\nof number of friendly jammers is shown. We can see that if there exists sufficiently-effective\njammers, the optimal secrecy rate does not change as the number of jammers increases. For\nthe sources, they always choose the most effective jammer to achieve the maximal secrecy\nrate, when additional jamming power from other jammers would decrease the optimal secrecy\nrate. In other words, in this scenario, the optimal secrecy rate can reach the maximal value\nwith the most effective jammer's help only. On the other hand, if there are no sufficientlyeffective jammers, the optimal secrecy rate will be improved up to the maximal value as the\nnumber of jammers increases.\nFinally, we compare the distributed solution with the centralized solution of secrecy rate.\nIn Fig. 11, we show the optimal secrecy rate of both the distributed and centralized schemes\nas a function of the gain factor a in (25) with the friendly jammer located at (1, 1). When a\nis large, the sources would care the gain of secrecy rate more than the jamming service cost\nin the game theoretical scheme. We can see that the performance gap between the distributed\nand centralized solutions of optimal secrecy rate is shrinking as a is increasing. And the\nsolutions are asymptotically the same when a is sufficiently large.\nVI. C ONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper, we have investigated the physical layer security for two-way relay communications with untrusted relay and friendly jammers. As a simple case, a two-way relay system\nwithout jammers is first studied, and an optimal power allocation vector of the sources and\nrelay nodes is found. We then investigated the secrecy rate in the presence of friendly jammers.\nFurthermore, we defined and analyzed a Stackelberg type of game between the sources and\nthe friendly jammers to achieve the optimal secrecy rate in a distributed way. Finally, we\nobtained a distributed solution for the proposed game. From the simulation results we can get\nthe following conclusions. First, a non-zero secrecy rate for two-way relay channel is indeed\navailable. Second, the secrecy rate can be improved with the help of friendly jammers, and\nthere is an optimal solution of jamming power allocation. Third, there is also a tradeoff for\nthe price a jammer sets, and if the price is too high, the sources will turn to buying from\nothers. For the game, we can see that the distributed algorithm and the centralized scheme\nhave similar performances, especially when the gain factor is sufficiently large.\n\n\f21\n\nR EFERENCES\n[1] A. D.
