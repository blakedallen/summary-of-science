The system consists of a semi-detached binary system comprised\nof a roche-lobe-filling giant (RG) and a massive (\u223c 1.2 M\u2299 ) white dwarf (WD; Shore et al.\n1996; Fekel et al. 2000). As in classical novae, the eruption follows a thermonuclear runaway\non the surface of the WD (Starrfield et al. 1988). In the case of the RS Oph class of RNe,\nhowever, the ejected material runs into, and shocks, a dense RG wind (Bode & Kahn 1985).\nThe 1985 eruption of RS Oph was, for the first time, the subject of a multi-wavelength\nobservational campaign, from the radio to the x-ray (Bode 1987). The most recent eruption,\non 2006 February 12.83 (Hirosawa 2006, we take this to define the origin of time: t = 0),\ntriggered an even more intensive campaign. Infrared (IR) observations by Das et al. (2006)\nand Evans et al. (2007, hereafter Paper I) show evidence for the shock, seen also at radio\n(O'Brien et al. 2006) and x-ray (Bode et al. 2006; Sokoloski et al. 2006; Ness et al. 2007;\nOsborne et al. 2007) wavelengths, as the ejecta interact with the RG wind. HST observations\nof the ejecta from the 2006 eruption (Bode et al. 2007) showed that emission in [O iii]5007\u00c5\nconsists of two 'rings' consistent with constant velocity expansion of the radio lobes seen\nearlier in the eruption (O'Brien et al. 2006). In contrast the [Ne v]3426\u00c5 lines possibly arise\nfrom two 'polar caps' at the extremities of the rings.\nWe present here further IR observations, obtained with the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS;\nHouck et al. 2004) on the Spitzer Space Telescope (Werner et al. 2003; Gehrz et al. 2007)\nand from ground-based facilities.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nObservations\n2.1.\n\nSpitzer\n\nRS Oph was observed on 2006 Apr 16 (t = 62.51 days) and 2006 Apr 26 (t = 72.54 days)\nwith Spitzer IRS as part of the Directors Discretionary Time program PID 270. Observations\nwere performed using all IRS modules, with IRS blue (13.3\u201318.6 \u03bcm) peak-up on RS Oph.\nThe spectroscopy consisted of 5 cycles of 14 second ramps in short-low mode, 5 cycles of\n30 second ramps in both short-high and long-low modes, and 5 cycles of 60 second ramps\nin long-high mode. IRS basic calibrated data products (BCDs) were processed with version\n14.0.0 of the IRS pipeline. Details of the calibration and raw data processing are specified\nin the IRS Pipeline Description Document1 , version 1.0.\nBad pixels were interpolated in individual BCDs using bad pixel masks provided by the\nSpitzer Science Center (SSC). For the low resolution data, multiple data collection events\nwere obtained at two different positions on the slit using Spitzer's nod function. The low\nresolution two-dimensional BCDs were differenced to remove the background flux contribution and the data were extracted with SPICE (version 1.3-beta1; Spice 2005) using the\ndefault point source extraction widths. For the high resolution data, the point spread function nearly fills the high resolution slit length, so it is not possible to perform background\nsubtraction using nod pairs. Instead, separate sky observations were used to construct a\nmaster sky that was subtracted from the individual BCDs to remove the background contribution. Extraction was performed in the same manner as for the low resolution modules.\nFor both resolution regimes the extracted, background-corrected data were combined, using\na weighted linear mean, into a single output data file. The point-to-point errors were estimated from the standard deviation of the flux at each wavelength bin except when there\nwere fewer than three data points in which case the errors generated by the SSC pipeline\nwere added in quadrature to determine the final error. For the high resolution modules, in\nthe order overlap regions, the long wavelength edge of the orders were much less reliable\nthan the short wavelength edges, and so only the short wavelength regions of overlap were\nretained, i.e. the data from the lower order. As suggested by the SSC, data outside the\nranges 5.2\u201314.5 \u03bcm for the SL module, 9.9\u201319.6 \u03bcm for the SH module, and 14.0\u201338.0 \u03bcm\nand 18.7\u201337.0 \u03bcm for the LL and LH modules, respectively, were discarded as unreliable.\nThe spectral lines were fit using a least squares Gaussian routine that fit the line center,\nline amplitude, continuum amplitude and the slope of the continuum. Individual segments\n< 10% to ensure that segments\nof the IRS spectrum were shifted upwards or downwards by \u223c\n1\n\nssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/irs/dh/PDD.pdf\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nadjoined smoothly. The spectrum for 2006 April 16 is shown in Fig. 1; the spectrum for\n2006 April 26 is not substantially different.\n\n2.2.\n\nGround-based observations\n\nThe SpeX/IRTF data were obtained on 2006 May 1 (t = 77.61 days) and June 3\n(t = 110.72 days), UT using a 0.8\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 15\u2032\u2032 slit and a 10\u2032\u2032 N\u2013S nod for background cancellation.\nNo chopping was performed and extinction corrections were not necessary because of the\nproximity of the calibrator star. Data reduction was done using SpeXTools (Cushing et al.\n2004) with HD164716 (B9V) as the calibrator star. The flux of HD164716 was obtained\nby using the Kurucz (1991; 1994) model of \u03b1 Lyr scaled to the V magnitude of HD164716.\nSpeXTools makes an automatic, and in this case small, correction for extinction based on\nthe measured (B \u2212 V ) colors. UKIRT observations were performed on 2006 April 16 and 24\n(t = days 62.72 and 70.66 respectively) using the UIST instrument; details of the observations\nand data reduction are given in Paper I. The spectra from both telescopes, in the 1\u20132.6 \u03bcm\nand 2.8\u20134.0 \u03bcm ranges, are shown in Figs. 2.\nOptical (BV r \u2032 i\u2032 z \u2032 ) photometry was obtained by the robotic 2m Liverpool Telescope (LT;\nSteele et al. 2004), sited on the island of La Palma, Canaries. Observations commenced as\nsoon as RS Oph had declined to a level that would not saturate the detectors; standard\nphotometric reduction techniques were used.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe IR spectrum contains numerous emission lines. In the Spitzer wavelength range\nthese lines are superimposed on a continuum that declines with increasing wavelength as f\u03bb \u221d\n\u03bb\u22122 , consistent with free-free emission. The emission lines include hydrogen recombination\nlines, together with fine structure lines, many of which are coronal; the hydrogen lines and\nfree-free emission will be discussed elsewhere. We use flux ratios for lines from the same\natomic species and within the same wavelength band to estimate the electron temperature\nin the region in which they originate; the line pairs are listed in Table 1. In Paper I the\n[Si vi]/[Si x] flux ratio enabled us to estimate the temperature of the shocked, IR-emitting\ngas, to be \u2243 9.3 \u00d7 105 K.\nIn this paper we have a wide range of ionic species and ionization stages at our disposal\nfrom which to estimate the electron temperature. Table 1 summarizes the collision strengths\n(\u03a9) at 105 K (Paper I) for the species and ionization stages observed in the IR spectra. This\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\ntemperature is the highest in these sources available in common to all species and stages of\nionization, and the temperature-dependence of \u03a9 is relatively weak. The ionization fractions\nare from Sutherland & Dopita (1993). The [Mg vii]5.50 \u03bcm feature is blended with the H 167 recombination line (\u03bb = 5.52 \u03bcm) at the resolution of the Spitzer SL mode. To correct\nfor this we assume Case B (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006), to estimate the expected flux ratio\nf (H16-7)/f (H9-7) \u2243 0.19 at electron density 2 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 (see below); we use the measured\nflux in the H 9-7 line (\u03bb = 11.31 \u03bcm) to correct the [Mg vii] line for the blend with H 16-7.\nIn view of the uncertainties (particularly in the applicability of Case B) we should give the\ntemperature derived from the Mg lines lower weight than that derived from other species.\nThe derived temperatures are given in Table 1 (column 4). The uncertainties in log T (K)\narising from uncertainties in the line fluxes are \u00b10.2. We note that the temperatures in\nTable 1, derived from the Ne lines (mean \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 105 K), are lower than those derived from\nSi and Mg lines. The temperature derived from the Si lines in this paper is not significantly\ndifferent from that given in Paper I during the early (t = 55.7 days) phase. Apparently there\nis a range of T values present in the shocked region. This result, derived from analysis of the\nIR emission lines, is also suggested by x-ray data obtained on 2006 April 16 (Osborne et al.\n2006) and follows naturally from models of the shock in RS Oph (O'Brien et al. 1992).\nWe shall assume that the electron temperature in the region in which the various Ne and\n[O iv] lines originate is 1.5 \u00d7 105 K, while that in the Si/Mg line emitting region is 9 \u00d7 105 K.\nThe resulting critical densities nc , below which radiative de-excitation begins to dominate\nover collisional de-excitation at the assumed temperatures, are given in Table 2.\nWe use the fluxes in the [Ne v]14.3,24.3 \u03bcm lines to estimate the electron density in the\n'cooler' line-emiting region. Denoting the 2 P2 , 2 P1 and 1 P0 levels as levels '2', '1' and '0'\nrespectively, the fluxes f in the 14.32 \u03bcm and 24.3 \u03bcm lines are\nf = nu\n\nhc\nV\nA\n,\n\u03bb\n4\u03c0D 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere nu (in cm\u22123 , u = 2, 1) is the population of the upper level, \u03bb is the wavelength, A\n(s\u22121 ) is the appropriate Einstein coefficient, V is the emitting volume and D (= 1.6 kpc;\nBode 1987) is the distance. Assuming that the [Ne v]14.2,24.3 \u03bcm lines arise in the same\nregion, the flux ratio gives n2 /n1 \u2243 0.6. Detailed balance between radiative de-excitation,\nand electron collisional excitation and de-excitation amongst the three levels, together with\nthe above values for n2 /n1 and the electron temperature, provide a value for the electron\ndensity ne . We find ne \u2243 2.2 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 in the [Ne v] emitting region.\nOn the basis of radio imaging of the ejecta, O'Brien et al. (2006) estimate that the\ndensity in the radio-emitting shell was \u223c 10\u221217 g cm\u22123 at t \u2243 14 days. The wind/ejecta\ngeometry is known to be complex (Bode et al. 2007); however assuming that the density\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\ndeclines as t\u22122 (appropriate for a uniformly expanding shell of constant thickness), we expect\nthe electron density would be \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 cm\u22123 at t \u2243 63 days, consistent with our estimate\nfrom the Ne lines. From Table 2 we see that this is generally below the critical density for\nall Ne lines with the exception of [Ne v]24.3 \u03bcm, the weakness of which compared with the\nother Ne lines may be consistent with a degree of collisional de-excitation.\nWe estimate the mass of emitting Ne, assuming that n0 + n1 + n2 = n([Ne v]), and using\nthe [Ne v] fluxes from Table 2 and equation (1). We find n([Ne v]) \u2243 8.4 \u00d7 10\u22129 M\u2299 for a\ndistance of D = 1.6 kpc and, using the fractional abundance of [Ne v] at 1.5 \u00d7 105 K from\nSutherland & Dopita (1993), we get M(Ne) \u2243 2 \u00d7 10\u22127 (D/kpc)2 M\u2299 . In principle, we could\nalso determine the mass of O; however it is clear from Table 2 that the deduced ne in the\nNe/O region exceeds the nc for the 2 P3/2 state of [O iv]. Consequently we conclude only that\n\u22127\n2\nM(O) >\n\u223c 1 \u00d7 10 (D/kpc) M\u2299 .\nIn principle it would be straightforward to use the fluxes in the IR Ne (and other\nspecies) lines, together with the fluxes in the H lines, to estimate the Ne:H ratio in the\nejecta/wind mix. However given the complex geometry of the ejecta as evidenced by the\nradio (O'Brien et al. 2006) and HST (Bode et al. 2007) observations we do not consider\nthat this is justified until we have a better understanding of the environment of RS Oph.\nHowever assuming that the emitting volumes of Ne and O coincide, we find n(O)/n(Ne) >\n\u223c 0.6,\ncompared with a {n(O)/n(Ne)}\u2299 of 6.6 (Asplund et al. 2005).\nIn Fig. 3 we plot the time-dependence of the coronal line fluxes for which we have the\nlongest time-base, namely S and Si; line fluxes for earlier data are taken from Paper I. It is\ncurious that the S line fluxes decline monotonically over the first \u223c 80 days of the eruption\nwhereas there is a distinct minimum in the line fluxes around t \u2243 70 days for the Si lines\n(the errors in the measured fluxes are typically \u2243 5%). We consider that this result is real,\nbecause (a) there is a consistent pattern in the behavior of the Si and S lines and (b) it\ncoincides (within the time resolution) with a distinct 'kink' in the BV r \u2032 i\u2032 z \u2032 light curves.\nThere is no corresponding break in either the x-ray light curve (which coincides with the\ndecline of the Super Soft phase; Ness et al. 2007) or in the variation of the hardness ratio\n(Osborne et al. 2007, see Fig. 3, which shows only the V and B light curves for clarity).\nIn classical novae, fluctuations in the visual light curve are often related to fluctuations\nin the mass-loss from the WD and the behavior of the pseudophotosphere; however, it is\ndifficult to see how this can also lead to changes in the coronal line fluxes. Accordingly we\nconsider it unlikely that this behavior is directly related to the mass-loss.\nFor the 1985 eruption of RS Oph, O'Brien et al. (1992) estimated that breakout of the\nshock from the edge of the RG wind occurred \u223c 60-70 days after the eruption, corresponding\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nto 70-80 days after the 2006 eruption, allowing for the greater inter-eruption interval. While\nthis is close to the day 70 event in the 2006 eruption, it is unlikely that the behavior seen\nin Fig. 3 is related to any simple breakout phenomenon, which will be far more complex\nthan the spherically symmetric model of O'Brien et al. (1992). Further, while the electron\ndensity we determine is for the Ne/O region, it is likely that this value is not atypical and the\ndisparity between the nc (Table 2) and ne values suggest that the behavior depicted in Fig. 3\nis not a collisional de-excitation effect. Fig. 3 suggests we may be seeing the combined effects\nof recombination, abundance gradients and element segretation, but a detailed discussion is\nbeyond the scope of this paper.\n\n4.\n\nConcluding remarks\n\nWe have presented the Spitzer IRS spectrum of RS Oph during its 2006 eruption, the\nfirst mid-IR observations of a RN in outburst. The IR spectrum, from 1 \u03bcm to 30 \u03bcm,\nshows the rich fine structure (including) coronal and H recombination line spectrum of the\nshocked RG wind. There are at least two temperature regimes in the shocked wind, and the\ndeduced electron density is consistent with extrapolation from radio observations earlier in\nthe eruption.\nThis work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope,\nwhich is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology under a contract with NASA.
