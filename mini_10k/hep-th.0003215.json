Introduction\nIt is striking that field theories on noncommutative spaces are naturally embedded\nin string theory. The first complete example of this phenomenon was found in toroidal\ncompactifications of Matrix Theory with a nonzero B field [1][2]. Of course the remarkable\nearly construction of membranes by large matrices [3] is very much in this spirit. After [1][2]\nadditional work was done on extracting noncommutative Yang-Mills theory more directly\nfrom open string theory [4]-[8]. In a sense this work culminated in [9] where, among other\nthings, a decoupling limit was carefully formulated in which perturbative open string theory\nreduced to noncommutative Yang-Mills theory. A large amount of work, partially inspired\nby these developments, has been done on the perturbative dynamics of noncommutative\nfield theories [10]-[30]. These field theories have a very interesting and unusual perturbative\nbehavior [26]-[30]. The noncommutativity of the underlying space gives rise to a strong\nmixing between the ultraviolet and the infrared [26][27]. There are analogs of this IR/UV\nmixing in string theory which provides one motivation to study these systems. When loop\ndiagrams are evaluated in these theories, large momentum regions of the loop integration\nlead to terms in the effective action that are infrared divergent and nonanalytic in the\nnoncommutativity parameter \u03b8. In conventional field theory, singularities in the low energy\neffective action usually reflect omission of relevant low energy degrees of freedom, and the\nlow energy description is cured once the the missing degrees of freedom are added. In\n[26][27], it was proposed that at least some of the novel IR/UV divergences of one loop\ndiagrams in the noncommutative theory could be understood as arising from tree level\nexchange of new degrees of freedom. This phenomenon is analogous to open-closed channel\nduality in one loop string graphs, where ultraviolet divergences in the open string channel\ncan be interpreted as infrared divergences arising from tree level exchange of massless\nclosed strings. This work is motivated in part by trying to understand this interpretation\nof the IR/UV singularities in noncommutative field theories.\nNoncommutative gauge theories can be realized in string theory by taking a low energy\ndecoupling limit of theories on D-branes, in the presence of a constant magnetic field\n[1][2][9]. In this stringy setup one can try to reproduce the noncommutative perturbative\nexpansion from string theory. This embedding confronts the issue of whether extra degrees\nof freedom \u2013 apart from the obvious massless open string modes \u2013 are needed to make sense\nof the low energy effective action. As we will show, there seems to be no need to add any\nfurther degrees of freedom. We can account for the entire field theory result by looking\n1\n\n\fat the region of cylinder moduli space which is dominated by massless open strings. The\nopposite region of moduli space, where massless closed strings dominate, gives a vanishing\ncontribution in the zero-slope limit and therefore seem to decouple in the field theory limit.\nThis seems to indicate that the degrees of freedom proposed in [26][27], even though they\nreproduce the low energy effective action after integrating them out, do not have a natural\ninterpretation as massless closed string states.\nIn section 2 we compute the two-point function of the pure noncommutative U (1)\ngauge theory in 3+1 dimensions at one loop in the background field gauge. The background\nfield gauge is very useful for comparing field theory amplitudes with the zero slope limit\nof string amplitudes because the effective action obtained in the background field gauge is\nmanifestly gauge invariant, as is the answer obtained in string theory. At one loop, the two\npoint function of the noncommutative gauge theory has terms which contain logarithmic\nand quadratic [28][30] infrared divergences which do not appear in conventional gauge\ntheories. The appearance of quadratic infrared divergences is surprising, but nevertheless\ncompatible with gauge invariance.\nIn section 3 we embed this gauge theory in bosonic string theory by considering the\nlow energy limit of the theory on a single D3-brane stuck at an R22 /Z2 orbifold singularity\nand in the presence of a magnetic field along the worldvolume directions [31][32]1 . We\ncompute at one loop the planar and non-planar contributions to the two-point function of\nphotons in the string theory. The field theory answer is reproduced by isolating from the\nstring theory amplitude the contribution coming from the boundary of cylinder moduli\nspace where massless open strings are important. Our result indicates that closed string\nmodes decouple from the low energy noncommutative field theory, just as they decouple\nfrom conventional gauge theories realized on branes. We conclude with a discussion of our\nresults in section 4.\n\n2. Gauge Theory Calculation\nIn this section we describe the calculation of the two point function in noncommutative\nU (1) gauge theory in the background field gauge. The action for the U(1) noncommutative\n1\n\nIn this paper we do not discuss the physics of noncommutative field theories with \u03b8 0i 6= 0.\n\nSuch a gauge theory can be realized by having a constant electric field along the brane. However,\nin the decoupling limit the upper bound of the allowed electric field vanishes and the string theory\nrealization is ill-defined.\n\n2\n\n\fYang-Mills theory in a background metric G\u03bc\u03bd is given by\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nd4 x \u2212GG\u03bc\u03c1 G\u03bd\u03c3 F\u03bc\u03bd \u22c6 F\u03c1\u03c3 ,\nS=\u2212\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the field strength is\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 ig[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]\n[A\u03bc , A\u03bd ] = A\u03bc \u22c6 A\u03bd \u2212 A\u03bd \u22c6 A\u03bc .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe action in (2.1) is invariant under the gauge transformation\n\u03b4\u03bb A\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03bb \u2212 ig[A\u03bc , \u03bb] \u2261 D\u03bc \u03bb.\n\n(2.3)\n\nThe noncommutative star product appearing in (2.1)(2.2) is defined by\ni\n\nf (x) \u22c6 g(x) = e 2\n\n\u2202\n\u03b8ij \u2202\u03b1\n\n\u2202\ni \u2202\u03b2j\n\nf (x + \u03b1) g(x + \u03b2)|\u03b1=\u03b2=0 ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nwhere the parameter \u03b8 ij is related to the commutator of the coordinates in the noncommutative space:\n[x\u03bc , x\u03bd ] = i\u03b8 \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(2.5)\n\nWe will quantize the theory in background field gauge [33][34].

The Feynman rules for the noncommutative U (1) theory can\nbe obtained from [34] by simply replacing the structure constants fabc by sin( 21 p\u03bc \u03b8 \u03bc\u03bd k\u03bd ),\nwhere p, k are the momenta of two of the gluons entering the vertex. The Feynman rules\nrelevant for the calculations of this paper are shown in fig. 1.\n4\n\n\fThe explicit gauge invariance of \u0393[0, A] simplifies computations in the gauge theory.\nThe bare field strength, when expressed in terms of the renormalized coupling and gauge\nfield, is\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\nbare\nF\u03bc\u03bd\n= ZA (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc \u2212 igZg ZA [A\u03bc , A\u03bd ]),\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere the Zg , ZA are the coupling constant and field renormalizations\n1/2\n\ng bare = Zg g, Abare\n= ZA Abare\n.\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u22121/2\n\nGauge invariance of (2.10) implies that ZA\n\n(2.11)\n\n= Zg . This means that the \u03b2-function can\n\nbe computed from ZA , which only requires knowledge of the two-point function of the\ntheory.\nThe background field gauge is also very useful for comparing field theory amplitudes\nwith the zero slope limit of string theory amplitudes. Ref. [35] derived the \u03b2-function of\nYang-Mills theory by calculating the effective action of strings in a background magnetic\nfield. Ref. [36] pointed out a correspondence between loop amplitudes in the background\nfield gauge and loops calculated using string motivated rules.\n\nMore recently, [37][38][39]\n\ncalculated two, three and four point gauge boson amplitudes in open bosonic string theory.\nUsing a suitable prescription for continuing the amplitudes off-shell, the renormalization\nconstants obtained from the zero slope limit of the string theory amplitudes were observed\nto respect the background field gauge Ward identities. We will see below that the low\nenergy limit of the string theory amplitudes in our D-brane construction reproduce the\nfield theory loop amplitudes calculated in the background field gauge.\nIn fig. 2 we show the one loop diagrams for the two-point function in U(1) noncommutative gauge theory.

This last term\nis interesting since it modifies the photon dispersion relation.\nWe will see in the next section that the zero slope limit of the one loop string theory\namplitude exactly reproduces the field theory answer (2.14)(2.15). The Schwinger parameter t in the field theory calculation is proportional to the modulus of the string world\nsheet while the Feynman parameter x is related to the separation of the vertex operators\non the worldsheet.\n\n3. The String Theory Calculation\nIn this section we reproduce the field theory results of section 2 using string theory.\nWe will find a simple realization of the noncommutative U(1) gauge theory using D3-branes\nin bosonic string theory and perform a one loop string calculation which will yield, in the\nmassless open string boundary of moduli space, the results of the previous section.\nA four dimensional pure U(1) gauge theory can be realized by taking the low energy\nlimit of the theory on a single D3-brane of bosonic string theory stuck at an R22 /Z2\norbifold singularity. This can be accomplished [31][32] by choosing the action of the orbifold\ngroup on the Chan-Paton factors to be represented by either of the two one-dimensional\n7\n\n\frepresentations of Z2 . The projection equation projects out the transverse scalars and we\nare left with only a gauge field. The noncommutative version of the pure U(1) gauge theory\ncan be obtained by applying a constant magnetic field along the D-brane worldvolume.\nThe quantum effective action of this gauge theory is encoded in the string theory\neffective action. An appropriate truncation of a string loop diagram should provide, in the\nlow energy limit, the field theory answer. We will explicitly verify at the one loop level that\nthe planar and non-planar two-point amplitudes for the photon on the cylinder in a background magnetic field reproduce the corresponding computations in the noncommutative\ngauge theory in the background field gauge.\nThe correlation function of the photon field vertex operators on the disk shows that\nthe low energy classical action on the brane is a noncommutative gauge theory with the\nusual replacement of conventional products by \u22c6-products [9]. Comparison between the\nstring theory calculation and the field theory fixes the normalization of the photon vertex\noperator to be\nV (z, k) = ig\n\nZ\n\n\u2202\u03a3\n\nds e * \u2202s Xeik*X ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere g is the tree level Yang-Mills coupling constant, e\u03bc is the polarization of the photon,\ns is the coordinate on the worldsheet boundary \u2202\u03a3 and indices are contracted with the\nG\u03bc\u03bd metric.\nThe worldsheet topology of the one-loop diagram is a cylinder, which we represent in\nthe complex z-plane as a rectangle of width \u03c0 and height 2\u03c0it \u2013 where 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u221e is the\nmodulus of the cylinder \u2013 and with the edges y = 0 and y = 2\u03c0it identified:\nz = x + iy\n\n0\u2264x\u2264\u03c0\n\ny \u2243 y + 2\u03c0t\n\n0 \u2264 y \u2264 2\u03c0t.\n\n(3.2)\n\nOpen string vertex operators must be inserted on the boundaries of the cylinder at either\nx = 0 or x = \u03c0, with the positions given by w = iy and w = \u03c0 + iy respectively.\nThe full two-point function is obtained by summing over the planar (two vertex operators on the same boundary) and non-planar (each vertex operator on a different boundary)\ndiagrams. These diagrams are given by\nA=\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndt\n2t\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0t\n\ndy1\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n2\u03c0t\n\ndy2 Z(t) < V (y1 , k1 )V (y2 , k2 ) >\u2261 e\u03bc1 e\u03bd2 \u03a0\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere one should keep in mind when computing < . . . > if the diagram is planar or nonplanar. The different terms in (3.3) are easily understood. The 1/2t factor arises from\n8\n\n\fexplicitly gauge fixing the path integral and dividing by the conformal Killing volume of\nthe cylinder (which allows all vertex operators to be unfixed). Z(t) is the open string\npartition function of the vacuum under consideration, which in our case is that of an open\nstring ending on D3-brane of bosonic string theory stuck at an orbifold singularity and\nin a background magnetic field. The correlator < . . . > is computed by contracting the\nfields using the Green's function on the cylinder with boundary conditions modified by the\nbackground magnetic field.\nThe open string partition function is a key ingredient in the measure of the correlation function (3.3). Worldsheet consistency conditions require projecting the open string\nspectrum onto states invariant under the action of the orbifold group. For our Z2 orbifold\nthis is reflected in the partition function\nZ(t) = Tr(\n\n1 + g \u22122tHo\ne\n) = Z1 (t) + Zg (t),\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere Ho is the open string Hamiltonian and g is the Z2 generator. The Z2 action on the\nendpoints of the string corresponding to a stuck D3-brane just multiplies (3.4) by unity\n[31][32][40].

F\u03bc\u03bd are the components of the\nbackground magnetic field.\nIn order to compute the correlation function (3.3) we must solve for the Green's\nfunction of the worldsheet scalars on the cylinder. The background magnetic field along\nthe brane does not modify the equations of motion of the open strings ending on it, but\nit does change the boundary conditions on the worldsheet fields.

We have to examine (3.15) in the decoupling limit specified in [9], which in\nparticular requires taking the \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit. In this limit we only get contributions from\ncorners of string moduli space. We will now show that we obtain the exact planar field\n\ntheory answer from the boundary of moduli space of the cylinder which is dominated by\nmassless open strings5 , which comes from the t \u2192 \u221e limit. We therefore need the large t\n\nexpression of the integrand in (3.15). The large t expansions of Z(t) and of \u2202y \u0393 are given\n\nby\nZ(t) \u2243 Vp+1 (8\u03c0 2 \u03b1\u2032 t)\u2212\n\np+1\n2\n\ne2\u03c0t + p \u2212 1 + O(e\u22122\u03c0t )\n\u0001\n\u2202y \u0393 \u2243 1 \u2212 2x + 2 e\u22122\u03c0xt \u2212 e2\u03c0xt e\u22122\u03c0t ,\n\n\u0001\n\n(3.16)\n\nwhere x = y/2\u03c0t. Plugging these expressions into (3.15) and tossing out the contribution\ndue to the tachyon, one gets (with d = p + 1 and g \u2192 g\u03bc4\u2212d )\nZ 1\nZ\n\u0001 \u2212k2 tx(1\u2212x)\n\u0001 \u221e\ng 2 \u03bc4\u2212d 2\n1\u2212d/2\n2\nP\ndx\nt\n8\n\u2212\n(d\n\u2212\n2)(1\n\u2212\n2x)\ne\n,\ndt\nk\nG\n\u2212\nk\nk\n\u03a0\u03bc\u03bd = i\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n(4\u03c0)d/2\n0\n0\n(3.17)\nwhich is precisely the field theory answer (2.14). To obtain this result we rescaled t \u2192 t/\u03b1\u2032\n\nand y \u2192 y/\u03b1\u2032 . In these new variables (with \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0) any finite value of t is in the extreme\n\nopen string limit of the moduli space. In particular the excited open string corrections in\n\u2032\n\n(3.16) become O(e\u22122\u03c0t/\u03b1 ) which vanish in the decoupling limit. This will be discussed\nfurther in Section 4.\n\n3.2.

The asymptotics of the term proportional to the open string metric G\u03c1\u03c3 is the same as for the planar\ndiagram. The important differences are in the terms proportional to the closed string metric g \u03bc\u03bd and the noncommutativity parameter \u03b8 \u03bc\u03bd . The term proportional to \u03b8 \u03bc\u03bd does not\ncontribute to the exponential in (3.10), but it plays a very important role in the derivative\nterms.\nSince this is a non-planar diagram for an oriented string, there is an overall factor of\n\u22121 since the ends of the string carry opposite charges.

Discussion\nIn the previous sections we have seen how the annulus (cylinder) amplitude of string\ntheory in a background F field reproduces, in the decoupling limit of [9], the planar and\nnonplanar results of noncommutative gauge theory. Let us discuss this in more detail.\nSchematically the two-point function on the annulus is given in the open string channel by\nA\u223c\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ndt t\n0\n\nX\n\nexp (\u2212\u2206I t).\n\n(4.1)\n\nI\n\nThe index I labels all open string states and \u2206I , basically the L0 eigenvalue, is the mass\nsquared of state I plus momentum dependence. In the decoupling limit of [9] \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 and\nhence the string mass scale is sent to infinity. The oscillator contribution to \u2206I is unaffected\n\nby F and hence is just NI /\u03b1\u2032 where NI is the total oscillator occupation number. So in the\n\u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 limit all the excited open string states become much heavier than the massless one\n\nand hence should decouple from the dynamics. The vanishing of the exponential corrections\n\nin (3.17) and (3.19) illustrates this. This is similar to other decoupling limits such as those\nwhich show that field theories arise from branes separated by short distances. As pointed\nout in [26] and further discussed in [27][30]there are peculiar singularities indicating IR/UV\nmixing in the nonplanar noncommutative gauge theory results. These results have been\ninterpreted to mean [26][27] that some closed string residue remains in the field theory, even\n13\n\n\fin the decoupling limit. So it is important to examine if and how decoupling is breaking\ndown here.\nGenerally, the only way decoupling can fail is for the interactions of the decoupled\ntheory to have bad high energy behavior. If loops of massless open string states are UV\ndivergent, then massive open string states will generally be excited, violating decoupling.\nIf the decoupled field theory is divergent but renormalizable then there will be a mild\nviolation of decoupling, but all the effects of the massive string states can be absorbed in\na few \"renormalized\" couplings. For instance, g 2 ln(\u2212p2 /\u03bc2 ) in (2.16) becomes, in string\ntheory, g 2 (ln(\u2212p2 \u03b1\u2032 ) + O(1)).\n\nNow let us examine decoupling in the nonplanar diagrams that display mysterious\n\nUV/IR singularities. We can write a caricature of the string amplitude (3.19) by suppressing the x integral, all numerical factors, and adding back in the effect of the first excited\nopen string state.\nANP \u223c\n\nZ\n\ndt t1\u2212d/2 e\u2212k\n\n2\n\nt\u2212k\u03032 /4t\n\n\u2032\n\n(1 + e\u22122\u03c0t/\u03b1 + . . .).\n\n(4.2)\n\nNote that the k\u0303 2 /4t term in the exponential renders the UV region of the modular integration (t \u2192 0) completely finite for any nonzero k\u0303 2 . This term is present in the field\n\ntheoretic amplitude (2.15) and represents the effect of the rapidly oscillating phases in the\nnoncommutative gauge theory interaction vertices. These phases are enough to render the\nnonplanar amplitude finite for any nonzero k\u0303 2 .\nThe smallest important value of t in (4.2) is roughly t \u223c k\u0303 2 . The contribution of the\n\nfirst excited state is then \u223c e\u22122\u03c0 k\u0303\n\n2\n\n/\u03b1\u2032\n\n. In the decoupling limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0 and this contribu-\n\ntion vanishes for any nonzero k\u0303 2 . The decoupled field theory amplitude is UV finite so\n\ndecoupling cannot fail.\nTo further investigate this question let us keep \u03b1\u2032 finite. There are then two regimes\nto consider. If k\u0303 2 \u226b \u03b1\u2032 then the excited open string state contribution is negligible and\n\nthe decoupled field theory result is accurate. If k\u0303 2 \u226a \u03b1\u2032 , however, the small t region of\nthe integral may be important. This depends on whether the field theory graph without\n\nphase factors is UV divergent. It will be, for instance, if the space-time dimension d is\nlarge enough. If there is a small t UV divergence then all the excited open string states will\nbecome important. In this case the correct way to analyze the situation is to use channel\nduality and rewrite the amplitude in terms of closed string states. At small t only the\nlightest closed string states will contribute, giving a massless propagator 1/k 2 (assuming\nwe drop the closed string tachyon).\n14\n\n\fThe region where the closed string description is valid becomes smaller and smaller\nas we approach the decoupling limit \u03b1\u2032 \u2192 0. In this limit the region of validity shrinks\n\nto a set of measure zero. For all finite k\u0303 2 the decoupled field theory describing only the\nlightest open string mode is exact. So the complete structure of the mysterious IR/UV\nsingularities is contained in the open string description.\nOf course one can formally represent the behavior of the lightest open string in the\ndual closed string channel. But this requires a sum over closed string states of arbitrarily\nhigh mass and does not seem very transparent. This is the usual situation in dualities.\nA regime that has a simple description in one set of variables typically has a complicated\ndescription in the dual variables.\nTo illustrate this point consider (4.2) for general d. The log divergence in d = 4\nbecomes a 1/k\u0303 d\u22124 divergence. The massless closed strings will produce a 1/k 2 behavior\nfor any d. To produce the open string behavior will require a sum over all the closed string\nstates.\nThere is at least one situation where decoupled field theory results can be reproduced\nfrom the lightest closed string state6 . This is the case where a nonrenormalization theorem\nexists [41][42][43]. The contribution of excited open string states vanishes, typically because\nthey are in long multiplets of an extended supersymmetry algebra. The exact amplitude\nis given by the lightest open string state, and so this must also agree with the closed string\nanswer. This mechanism seems to require lots of supersymmetry, and usually applies only\nto special amplitudes. So it seems questionable whether it will be helpful in giving a\ngeneral explanation for these mysterious singularities.\nNote Added\nIn the past week the papers [44][45][46] appeared on the archive.
