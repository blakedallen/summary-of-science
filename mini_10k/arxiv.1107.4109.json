INTRODUCTION\n\nMost very luminous galaxies at z \u223c 0 emit the bulk of\ntheir luminosity in the infrared (IR). These luminous and\nultraluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs and ULIRGs, infrared luminosity LIR [8 \u2212 1000\u03bcm] > 1011 and LIR >\n1012 L\u2299 ) make up the majority of galaxies with Lbol &\n1011.5 L\u2299 . These systems often correspond to major\nmergers and compared to normal star-forming disk galaxies, U/LIRGs exhibit enhanced, concentrated molecular\ngas content, high star formation efficiency, increased active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity, and disturbed morphologies (Sanders & Mirabel 1996). Even the closest\nULIRGs are & 100 Mpc away with compact radio, IR,\nand millimeter line emission (e.g., Lonsdale et al. 1993;\nDownes & Solomon 1998; Sakamoto et al. 2008), so that\nhigh angular resolution (such as that obtained by the\nEVLA) is required to study their structure.\nNonthermal (synchrotron) radio emission is wellestablished to track infrared emission (the \"radio-FIR\ncorrelation,\" Helou et al. 1985; Condon 1992; Yun et al.\n2001) while thermal (bremsstrahlung) radio emission at\n\u03bd & 4 GHz gives an unobscured view of ionizing photon\nproduction. These emission mechanisms, the indifference\nof radio waves to dust, and the resolving power of cmwave interferometers make the radio continuum a natural\n1 National Radio Astronomy Observatory, 520 Edgemont\nRoad, Charlottesville, VA, 22903-2475, USA\n2 National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P.

Deviations from the radio-IR correlation, radio morphology, and brightness can all help distinguish the presence and contribution of AGN to the overall luminosity, though not necessarily uniquely (Condon et al. 1991;\nLonsdale et al. 1995; Sajina et al. 2008; Lonsdale et al.\n2006, and references in the latter).\nThis letter reports first results from our Expanded Very\nLarge Array (EVLA) program to explore the structure of\nstar formation in U/LIRGs using radio continuum emission. We are imaging 22 of the most luminous nearby\nU/LIRGs (LIR > 1011.6 L\u2299 ) in the C (4-8 GHz) band and\nKa (26.5-40 GHz) bands. Here we report observations\nfrom the EVLA's C and D configurations. The EVLA's\ncontinuum sensitivity makes it possible to achieve good\nsignal-to-noise ratio, even at high frequencies, with modest time on source. The large instantaneous bandwidth\nallows us to probe the radio spectral index, \u03b1 (defined so\nthat F\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ), both within and between bands.\nHere explore variations in the radio spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) of our targets and in the radio-IR\ncorrelation. In a simple picture dominated by star formation we would expect the C band to be dominated\nby synchrotron emission with spectral index \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.8\nwhile the Ka contains an approximately equal mixture\nof nonthermal emission and thermal emission, which has\n\u03bd = \u22120.1. For systems dominated by an AGN the spectral index may show wider variation depending on the\norientation of the AGN or injection spectrum of electron\nenergies. We close by showing overlays of the Ka-band\nemission on HST imaging. These highlight the EVLA's\nimproved ability to trace embedded star formation at\nhigh resolution.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTION\n\nOur EVLA resident shared risk observing program,\nAL746, is imaging radio continuum emission from nearby\nLIRGs and ULIRGs. The sample, listed in Table 1, consists of 22 of the most luminous members of the IRAS Re-\n\n\f2\n\nLeroy et al.\n\nvised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS Sanders et al. 2003)\nnorthern enough to be observed by the EVLA. Distances\nspan 50\u2013300 Mpc, with a median of 177 Mpc, and IR\nluminosities go from log10 LIR [L\u2299 ] = 11.6\u201312.69.\nThe whole program consists of imaging each target at\nfour frequencies, \u03bd \u223c 4.7, 7.2, 29, and 36 GHz, with\na bandwidth of 1 GHz centered at each frequency. We\nobserve the two low frequency windows (together the \"Cband\" data) and two high frequencies (the \"Ka-band\"\ndata) simultaneously. Here we report the results from\nthe two most compact EVLA configurations (C and D).\nWe observed each target for \u223c 5 minutes in each band\nand configuration.\nWe reduced the data using the Common Astronomy\nSoftware Applications (CASA) package developed by\nNRAO. We adopted standard approaches to flag bad\ndata (radio frequency interference is a particular issue in\nthe C band) and calibrate the bandpass, phase, and amplitude response of individual antennas. We iteratively\nself-calibrated the data whenever possible.\nWe combined all data for each band into a single image\nusing CASA's multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) capabilities (see Sault & Wieringa 1994). This image reconstruction mode synthesizes interferometer observations across\na wide bandwidth. It accounts for changes in the synthesized beam as a function of frequency and produces\nimages of intensity for a fiducial frequency and maps of\nthe spectral index. For our data, these fiducial frequencies are 5.95 GHz for the C band and 32.5 GHz for the\nKa band. Note that we do not actually observe at either\nof these frequencies, they are merely a intermediate between our two separated 1 GHz windows. At C-band, we\ndeconvolved (CLEAN) the image using components that\nhave both a flux density and a spectral index. At Ka\nband we use components that have only flux density at\nthe fiducial frequency because we expect a flatter spectral index, have a lower signal-to-noise ratio, and have a\nsmaller fractional bandwidth.\nAfter reduction, we have maps of intensity for C and\nKa band and spectral index at C band. Synthesized\nbeams are \u223c 8\u2032\u2032 at C band and \u223c 1\u2032\u2032 at Ka band. The\nnoise in a C-band image is usually \u2248 20 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 ,\nthough for our brightest targets calibration issues sometimes limit us to about twice this value. A typical noise\nin a Ka-band image is \u2248 50 \u03bcJy beam\u22121 . All targets are\ndetected, with peak SNR from 200 to 6.3\u00d7103 at C band\n(median 670) and 12 to 500 at Ka band (median 50).\nWe measure C-band flux densities in the following way:\nwe estimate the RMS noise away from the source. We\nthen identify the region of contiguous SNR > 10 emission\nthat contains the galaxy. We integrate over this area to\nderive the flux density. We take theR intensity-weighted\nR\nmean of the spectral index h\u03b1C i = F\u03bd \u03b1/ F\u03bd derived\nby the MFS CLEAN as the spectral index for the source.\nWe derive Ka-band flux densities by integrating over the\nsame area used to derive the C-band flux densities. Over\nthis matched area, two galaxies have integrated SNR < 3\nat Ka and we omit them from all Ka-band related analysis.\n9 This refers to estimates of the \"total\" (8-1000\u03bcm) infrared\nluminosity constructed from IRAS flux densities by Sanders et al.\n(2003) following Sanders & Mirabel (1996).\n\n3. RESULTS\n3.1. A Typical Synchrotron Spectrum at C-Band\n\nThe left panel in Figure 1 compares our measured Cband flux densities at 5.95 GHz (x-axis) to previous measurements at 8.4 GHz (black circles) and 1.5 GHz (open\nsquares) both drawn from Condon et al. (1991). Table 1\nreports internal C-band spectral indices, \u03b1C . Our median\n\u03b1C is \u22120.67 with 1\u03c3 scatter \u2248 0.15. The SNR of the data\nare very high but an uncertainty of even a few percent in\nthe relative calibrations of the two parts of the C-band\n(e.g., due to calibration problems, radio frequency interference, uncertainties in the primary calibrator model, or\nCLEAN issues) will lead to uncertainties \u223c 0.1.\nWe expect nonthermal (synchrotron) emission to dominate the C-band. Our measured \u03b1 = \u22120.67 is close to\na normal synchrotron spectral index for a star-forming\ngalaxy, \u03b1 \u2248 \u22120.8 (Condon 1992) though AGN can\nproduce similar indices. For \u03b1C = \u22120.67, Figure 1\nshows that our C-band flux densities agree with the Xband measurements of Condon et al. (1991) well. The\nmedian ratio after correcting to the same band using\n\u03b1C = \u22120.67 is \u2248 1.02 and the scatter is 14%, indicating\nvery good agreement. Thus our C-band measurements\nfrom \u2248 4.2\u20135.2 and 6.7\u20137.7 GHz and previous measurements at 8.44 GHz all exhibit good consistency with a\ntypical synchrotron spectrum.\n3.2. Departures From a Simple SED at Low and High \u03bd\n\nIn the simple two-component model outlined in the\nintroduction synchrotron emission with \u03b1 \u223c \u22120.8 dominates below \u03bd \u223c 10 GHz. Above this frequency, the\nradio continuum results from a mixture of synchrotron\nand thermal emission, which has \u03b1 = \u22120.1. In a normal star-forming galaxy the ratio of these two processes\nmay be approximately fixed. Figure 2 shows the radio\nSEDs of our targets, which exhibit significant departures\nfrom this picture at both high and low frequency. We\nnormalize each SED at 5.95 GHz, show literature flux\ndensities from Condon et al. (1991) and Clemens et al.\n(2008), and overplot the simple two-component, optically\nthin model from Condon (1992). The lines through our\nC-band points show our measured \u03b1C .\nAt low frequencies, the 1.5 GHz (L band) flux densities lie mostly below an extrapolation of the synchrotron\nemission measured in C-band, which appears as a dashed\nline in Figure 2. This can be seen from the left panel in\nFigure 1 where the 1.5 GHz points (open squares) tend\nto scatter below the value expected for our measured \u03b1C\n(dashed). Our C-band flux densities and \u03b1C demonstrate\nnormal synchrotron emission at \u03bd & 4 GHz. The low Lband flux densities imply that the radio SED becomes\nflatter (\u03b1 approaches 0) near \u03bd \u223c 1 GHz. This effect was\npreviously inferred from unusually flat (near 0) spectral\nindices contrasting 1.5-to-8.4 GHz (Condon et al. 1991)\nand directly observed via long wavelength observations\nby Clemens et al. (2010).\nFor a normal star-forming galaxy, we expect the radio\nSED to contain an increasing fraction of thermal emission (\u03b1 = \u22120.1) moving toward higher frequencies. By\n\u223c 30 GHz (the Ka band), the SED of such a galaxy would\ncontain roughly equal parts thermal and non-thermal\nemission with flatter \u03b1 than at 5.95 GHz. Figure 2 shows\nthat this simple expectation does not hold for our data.\n\n\fRadio Spectrum of U/LIRGS\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- (left) Flux densities from Condon et al. (1991) (y-axis) as a function of our 5.95 GHz (C-band) flux density (x-axis). Filled\ncircles show X-band (8.4 GHz) flux densities. Open squares show L-band (1.5 GHz) flux densities. Dashed lines show the expected flux\ndensity given our C-band flux density and a spectral index \u03b1 = \u22120.67. Our C-band flux densities agree well with the X-band values. The\nL-band flux densities tend to lie below the expected value, indicating curvature in the radio SED in the range 1\u20135 GHz. (right) Ratio of\nfar-infrared to radio emission (q) for Ka (open diamonds), C (black circles), and L (open squares) bands. All three bands correlate with\nIR emission, as expected, with the lowest scatter in the C-band. The highest luminosity source, with an inverted spectrum, is UGC 08058\n(Markarian 231), which is dominated by an AGN. Red outlines highlight source and two other outliers discussed in the text.\n\nOur Ka-band flux densities tend to lie below the simple model: the model predicts a typical C-to-Ka ratio\n\u2248 2.4, while our median ratio is \u2248 3.15 with 1\u03c3 scatter\n0.75. The radio spectrum is significantly steeper than\nexpected moving to higher frequencies.\nA steep SED at high frequencies has been previously\nobserved in U/LIRGs by Clemens et al. (2008), and the\ndwarf starburst NGC 1569 (Lisenfeld et al. 2004). If\nthere is a significant thermal contribution at \u03bd \u223c 30 GHz,\nand there must be based on the high level of star formation in these systems, then the synchrotron spectral\nindex must be steepening. Clemens et al. (2008) discuss\npossible mechanisms for this and Clemens et al. (2010)\nrevisit the topic, while Lisenfeld et al. (2004) discuss possible explanations for a similar observation in the starburst NGC 1569. Allowing that the thermal emission\nshould be present, the synchrotron emission must be depressed at high frequency. Depressed synchrotron emission could result from synchrotron and inverse Compton\nlosses in aging starbursts or regions with high magnetic\nfields. However, there is no evidence that we observe all\nof these galaxies at a preferential time and these explanations appear inadequate to match the magnitude of\nthe effect. Alternatively, the injection spectrum of electron energies could differ from those in normal galaxies.\nThis is possible for an AGN, but less plausible for radio continuum emission originating from star formation.\nWe suspect that a modified injection spectrum leads to a\ndeficit of high frequency synchrotron emission and drives\nthe high-frequency flux deficit. This is a topic that we\nwill investigate further with our full high resolution data.\nDepressed synchrotron at high frequencies may be a\nway to distinguish systems where the radio is dominated\nby AGN. We expect a minimum level of thermal emission\nin systems with radio emission due mostly to star formation, so AGN likely provide most of the radio emission\n\nin the steepest-spectrum sources.\n3.3. Radio-Infrared Correlation\nDespite the surprises in the radio SED, the radio and\ninfrared fluxes still track one another well. We calculate the far-infrared-to-radio ratio defined by Helou et al.\n(1985) as q\u03bd = log10 (FFIR /S\u03bd ) with FFIR the farIR flux10 in units of 3.75 \u00d7 1012 W m\u22122 and S\u03bd in\nW m\u22122 Hz\u22121 . The median q5.95 = 2.8 with a scatter\nof \u2248 0.16 dex. The Ka band shows comparable scatter.\nThe L-band q1.5 has \u223c 50% more scatter, \u223c 0.25 dex.\nYun et al. (2001) observed 0.26 dex scatter in the L-band\nradio-IR correlation and 0.33 dex scatter for LIRGs and\nULIRGs. The smaller overall scatter in our sample may\nsimply be a result of small number statistics. We interpret the lower scatter at high frequencies in our sample\nas a manifestation of the same phenomenon that leads\nto higher scatter in q1.5 at high luminosities. The curved\nSED at low frequencies in luminous IR galaxies adds scatter to the radio-IR correlation as physical processes other\nthan just star formation become important. At higher\nfrequencies and in lower luminosity galaxies the effects\nare less important.\nThe correlation among the radio bands is stronger than\nthe correlation with the IR, with the strongest correlation\namong the two synchrotron dominated bands: q5.95 and\nq32.5 rank correlate with 0.67; q5.95 and q1.5 exhibit a\nrank correlation coefficient of 0.81; q1.5 and q32.5 have a\nrank correlation 0.57.\nThree galaxies lie notably off the radio-IR correlation.\nThe radio emission from UGC 08058 (Markarian 231) is\nmuch (4.5\u03c3) brighter than one would derive from the IR\nemission. UGC 05101 shows a weaker (2.5\u03c3) excess in the\n10 To calculate q we use the IRAS-defined far-IR flux, which\ncaptures flux from 40\u2013120\u03bcm, not the integrated IR flux quoted\nelsewhere in this paper.\n\n\f4\n\nLeroy et al.\n\nFig. 2.- Normalized spectral energy distributions of our targets, sorted by IR luminosity from top left to bottom right. Gray regions show\nour observed frequencies and circles indicate our measured flux densities. Lines show \u03b1C across our C-band measurement. We normalize\nall values to the 5.95 GHz value and plot literature measurements as open symbols. The dashed line shows a simple two-component model\nmixing optically thin synchrotron (\u03b1 = \u22120.8) with thermal emission (\u03b1 = \u22120.1) at levels appropriate for a star-forming galaxy (Condon\n1992). Our C-band measurements show an approximately normal synchrotron shape in most sources, but U/LIRGs depart from this simple\nmodel at low and high frequencies. Our new Ka measurements confirm a systematic deficit of high-frequency emission, extending this\nresult to higher frequencies (\u03bd \u223c 36 GHz).\n\nsame direction. Both galaxies show evidence for AGN in\nVLBI observations (Lonsdale et al. 1993, 2003). Though\nthe contribution of the AGN to the bolometric luminosity\nis debated, Veilleux et al. (2009) estimate the fraction of\ntotal IR emission due to the AGN to be \u223c 70 \u00b1 15% in\nUGC 08058 and \u223c 35 \u00b1 15% in UGC 05101 Armus et al.\n(see 2007, for an even lower estimate).\nIRASF 08572+3915 shows unusually (2.5\u03c3) strong IR\nemission. This is our faintest target and its IR-excess\nhas been noted before (see discussion in Yun et al. 2004)\nwith \u223c 25% of the IR emission in this galaxy associated with a very hot T & 300 K dust component\n(Armus et al. 2007, the largest such fraction in their\nsample). The flat spectral index at low frequencies\nand the high IR-to-radio ratio in this galaxy could be\nnaively interpreted to indicate a very young starburst\n\n(e.g. Roussel et al. 2006). For example, this galaxy sits\nnext to the youngest-age model point in the diagrams of\nBressan et al. (2002). However, based on near- and midIR spectroscopy (Armus et al. 2007; Risaliti et al. 2010)\nand X-Ray hardness (Iwasawa et al. 2011) much of the\nluminosity is thought to come from a deeply embedded\nAGN in the northwest nucleus. In either case, a luminous, compact, deeply embedded object drives the luminosity and results unusually strong IR emission. We\ndetect it at Ka band, but not at > 3\u03c3 over the C-band\naperture so that further study will have to wait for the\nthe better SNR and smaller matched apertures from our\nfull data set.\n3.4. Tracing Embedded Star Formation\n\n\fRadio Spectrum of U/LIRGS\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.- EVLA Ka-band contours superimposed on grey scale HST ACS/WFC I-band (F814W) images of CGCG 448-020 (II Zw 096,\nleft) and NGC 3690 (right), both on a logarithmic stretch. The contours are displayed in six evenly spaced log steps between 10\u2013100% of\npeak intensity for II Zw 096 and 2\u2013100% of the peak intensity for NGC 3690.\n\nFigure 3 shows our Ka-band emission superimposed\non I-band HST images for two targets, CGCG 448-020\n(II Zw 096, left) and NGC 3690 (right). The images show\nthe utility of combining high-resolution radio data with\nthe multiwavelength data assembled by the Great Observatory All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS, Armus et al.\n2009) to assess the distribution and strength of embedded star formation and AGN activity. In II Zw 096, the\nbrightest radio continuum point does not have an obvious optical counterpart. This bright radio emission\ncoincides with the peak of the IR emission measured\nby Spitzer (Inami et al. 2010), underscoring that this is\na star-forming peak without an obvious optical signature. In NGC 3960 (right), several of the radio sources\nhave optical counterparts, but without the radio emission it is difficult to determine which optical knots harbor luminous embedded activity. Here too, the 32.5 GHz\ncontinuum peaks coincide with the bright IR emission\n(Alonso-Herrero et al. 2010) but with higher angular resolution.\n3.5. Summary\n\nWe present new measurements of radio continuum\nemission from 22 U/LIRGs across 1 GHz windows centered at 4.7, 7.2, 29, and 36 GHz. Our observations\nare consistent with typical synchrotron emission at 4.2\u2013\n7.7 GHz. Comparing these normal C-band results with\nnew high-frequency 29\u201336 GHz fluxes and literature measurements at L, X, and K-bands, we see that the radio\n\nSEDs of U/LIRGs systematically deviate from a simple\ntwo-component model at both low and high frequencies.\nThe new EVLA data here provide: 1) observations filling in previously unsampled parts of the radio SED; 2)\na clear observation of \"normal\" synchrotron behavior in\nthe range 4\u20138 GHz, reinforcing that the radio SED must\nbe curving away from simple expectations; and 3) an observation of systematically low high-frequency flux density at higher frequencies than have been previously studied. The radio fluxes correlate with IR emission as expected, with some suggestion that the C- and Ka-bands\nexhibit a more direct link to IR emission than the Lband.\nAn ongoing extension of this project to all EVLA configurations will dramatically improve our resolution and\nsignal-to-noise ratio in both frequency bands. Combining these data with the multiwavelength data available\nfor our targets, we expect to test if the star formation surface density exhibits any maximum value (e.g.,\nthe limit set by momentum-driven winds suggested by\nMurray et al. 2005), derive characteristic sizes for the\nstar-forming disks, map the spectral index at . 0.5\u2032\u2032\nresolution, and explore the implications of the brightness temperature and radio SED for the dominant radio\nemission mechanism.\nWe thank the anonymous referee for suggestions that\nimproved this work.
