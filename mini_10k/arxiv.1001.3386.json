In [EH89, Theorem 1] Ekeland-Hofer prove that for a centrally symmetric, restricted contact type hypersurface in R2n and for any global, centrally symmetric Hamiltonian perturbation there exists a leaf-wise intersection point. In this note we show that\nif we replace restricted contact type by star-shaped there exists infinitely many leaf-wise\nintersection points or a leaf-wise intersection point on a closed characteristic.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet S \u2282 R2n be a hypersurface. Then S carries a rank-1-foliation where the tangent space\nto a leaf LS (x) through x \u2208 S is given by LS (x) := {v \u2208 Tx S | \u03c9(v, w) = 0 \u2200w \u2208 Tx S}. Here\n\u03c9 is the standard symplectic form on R2n . A point x \u2208 S such that\n\u03c81 (x) \u2208 LS (x)\n\n(1.1)\n\nis called a leaf-wise intersection point, see [Mos78]. A hypersurface is of restricted contact\ntype if there exists a 1-form \u03bb \u2208 \u03a91 (R2n ) with\n(\nd\u03bb = \u03c9\n(1.2)\n\u03bbx (v) 6= 0 \u2200v \u2208 LS (x) .\nWe call a hypersurface Z/2-invariant or centrally symmetric if it is invariant under the symplectic involution I : R2n \u2212\u2192 R2n given by I(x) = \u2212x. We set D\u03c9,Z/2 := {\u03c6 \u2208 Symp(R2n ) |\n\u03c6 \u25e6 I = I \u25e6 \u03c6}. In [EH89] Ekeland and Hofer prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.1 ([EH89], Theorem 1). Assume that S \u2282 R2n is a connected, compact, Z/2invariant hypersurface of restricted contact type. Let t \u2192 \u03c8t be an isotopy of the identity in\nD\u03c9,Z/2 . Then there exists a leafwise intersection point x \u2208 S.\nIn this article we improve Theorem 1.1 under the additional assumption that S bounds a\nstar-shaped (with respect to the origin) regionP\nin R2n , that is, it is of restricted contact type\n1\nxi dyi \u2212 yi dxi .\nwith respect to the standard primitive \u03bb0 = 2\n\nTheorem 1.2. Assume that S \u2282 R2n is a connected, compact, Z/2-invariant, star-shaped\nhypersurface. Let t \u2192 \u03c8t be an isotopy of the identity in D\u03c9,Z/2 . Then there exist infinitely\nmany leaf-wise intersection points on S or there exists a leaf-wise intersection point y such\nthat the leaf LS (y) is closed, that is, LS (y) is a closed characteristic.\nRemark 1.3. If n \u2265 2 then for a generic isotopy of Z/2-equivariant \u03c8t \u2208 D\u03c9,Z/2 there are\nno leaf-wise intersection points on closed characteristics. Hence, there exist infinitely many\nleaf-wise intersection points. This follows from a Z/2-invariant version of [AF08a, Theorem\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53D40, 37J10, 58J05.\nKey words and phrases.

That Theorem 3.3 holds in the Z/2-invariant case is due to the fact that for critical\npoints (v, \u03b7) of A (see below) the loop v does not pass through the fix point 0 of I since for\nan invariant Hamiltonian function H the Hamiltonian flow \u03c6tH fixes 0 for all times.\nAcknowledgments.

Equivariant Rabinowitz Floer homology\nWe consider the standard symplectic space (R2n , \u03c9 = d\u03bb0 ) and the symplectic involution\nI : R2n \u2212\u2192 R2n \u0001given by I(x) = \u2212x. Let F : R2n \u2212\u2192 R be the I-invariant function\nF (x) := 12 |x|2 \u2212 1 . In particular, the Rabinowitz action functional\nA : C \u221e (S 1 , R2n ) \u00d7 R \u2212\u2192 R\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\n(v, \u03b7) 7\u2192 \u2212 v \u03bb0 \u2212 \u03b7 F (v)dt\n\n(2.1)\n\nis invariant under I. Moreover, I acts freely on the critical points of A and on the space of\ngradient flow lines (in the sense of Floer) which asymptotically converge to critical points,\nwhere we use an I-invariant compatible almost complex structure J to define the gradient of\nA. Therefore, we can construct equivariant Rabinowitz Floer homology easily as follows:\n.\nZ/2\nRFCk (S 2n\u22121 , R2n ) := RFCk (S 2n\u22121 , R2n ) (Z/2)\n(2.2)\n\u2202 Z/2 [x] := [\u2202x]\nFor details on the construction of Rabinowitz Floer homology and its relation with leaf-wise\nintersection points we refer to [CF09, AF08b]\nTheorem 2.1 ([CF09]). Since S 2n\u22121 is Hamiltonianly displaceable\nRFH\u2217 (S 2n\u22121 , R2n ) \u223c\n=0\n\n(2.3)\n\nTheorem 2.2. For all k \u2208 Z we have\nZ/2\nRFHk (S 2n\u22121 , R2n ) \u223c\n= Z/2 .\n\n(2.4)\nS 2n\u22121\n\nProof. For a critical point (v, \u03b7) of A the \u03b7-periodic loop v(t/\u03b7) is a Reeb orbit on\nwith\nrespect to the standard contact form or in case (v, 0) the loop v(t) is constant and represents\na point on S 2n\u22121 . Since the Reeb flow \u03c6t on S 2n\u22121 is periodic the action functional A is\nMorse-Bott with critical manifolds\n\u223c S 2n\u22121 k \u2208 Z\nCk =\n(2.5)\nwhere a point x \u2208 S 2n\u22121 is identified with (t \u2192\n7 \u03c62\u03c0kt (x), 2\u03c0k) \u2208 Ck . The Conley-Zehnder\n2n\u22121\nindex \u03bcCZ equals 2nk on Ck . We fix on S\nthe Morse function\nf (x1 , . . . , x2n ) :=\n\n2n\nX\ni=1\n\nix2i .\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fON A THEOREM BY EKELAND-HOFER\n\n3\n\n\u000e\nf descends to a Z/2-perfect Morse function f \u0304 on RP2n\u22121 = S 2n\u22121 (Z/2). In particular, f \u0304\nhas precisely one critical point in each degree 0, . . . , 2n \u2212 1 and therefore, f has critical points\nyl , zl of degree l = 0, . . . , 2n \u2212 1 satisfying \u2212yl = zl . The Morse differential \u03b4 computes to\n\u03b4yl = yl\u22121 + zl\u22121 = \u03b4zl ,\n\n\u2200 l = 1, . . . , 2n \u2212 1\n\n(2.7)\n\nand therefore in the quotient using the notation \u03bel := [yl ] = [zl ]\n\u03b4\u03bel = 2\u03bel\u22121 = 0 \u2200 l = 1, . . . , 2n \u2212 1 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nWe define Morse functions\nf k : Ck \u2212\u2192 R, k \u2208 Z\n(2.9)\nk\n2n\u22121\nk\nk\n\u223c\nby f := f via the identification Ck = S\n. We denote the critical points of f by yl , zlk ,\nl = 0, . . . , 2n \u2212 1.\nThe boundary operator \u2202 in Rabinowitz Floer homology is defined by counting gradient\nflows lines with cascades, see [Fra04, CF09]. Since the Conley-Zehdner index equals 2nk on\nthe critical manifolds Ck the complex RFC\u2217 (S 2n\u22121 , R2n ) has exactly two generators in each\ndegree.

According to Theorem 2.1 by CieliebakFrauenfelder we have RFH\u2217 (S 2n\u22121 , R2n ) \u223c\n= 0. This implies that ak = bk = 1 since otherwise\nk+1\ny0 is a cycle but not a boundary, compare figure 1.\n\nylk\n\nzlk\n\n\u03belk\n\nk\nyl\u22121\n\nk\nzl\u22121\n\nk\n\u03bel\u22121\n\nk\nyl\u22122\n\nk\nzl\u22122\n\nk\n\u03bel\u22122\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nFigure 1.

This proves the Theorem.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn [AF10] we associated spectral values \u03c3(\u03be) to homology classes \u03be in Rabinowitz Floer\nhomology. We define\nZ/2\n\nS := {\u03c3(\u03belk ) | \u03belk \u2208 RFH\u2217 (S 2n\u22121 , R2n )} .\n\n(2.13)\n\nFrom the proof of Theorem 2.1 is follows immediately\nS = 2\u03c0Z\n\n(2.14)\n\nsince A(\u03belk ) = \u22122\u03c0k.\n3. Proof of Theorem 1.2\nWe first assume that the isotopy \u03c8t is generated by a compactly supported Hamiltonian\nfunction H : R2n \u00d7 [0, 1] \u2212\u2192 R. Since \u03c8t \u25e6 I = I \u25e6 \u03c8t we can assume\nH(t, I(x)) = H(t, x) .\n\n(3.1)\n\nMoreover, since S is star-shaped it is a graph over the standard sphere S 2n\u22121 . Therefore, we\ncan find \u0001a family of functions Fr : R2n \u2212\u2192 R, r \u2208 [0, 1], such that F1\u22121 (0) = S, F0 = F =\n1\n2n\u22121 . Thus, all\n2\n\u22121\n2 x \u2212 1 , and all hypersurfaces Fr (0) are I-invariant and graphs over S\nRabinowitz action functionals\nAr : C \u221e (S 1 , R2n ) \u00d7 R \u2212\u2192 R\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\n(v, \u03b7) 7\u2192 \u2212 v \u03bb0 \u2212 \u03b7 Fr (v)dt \u2212 rH(t, v)dt\n\n(3.2)\n\nK := {\u03c8t (x) | x \u2208 S, t \u2208 [0, 1]} \u2282 R2n\n\n(3.3)\n\nare I-invariant. Moreover, I acts freely on the critical points and gradient flow lines for\neach r \u2208 [0, 1]. Equality 2.14 implies that A0 has critical points of arbitrarily large critical\nvalue. [AF10, Corollary 5.13] implies that then also A1 has to have critical points with\narbitrarily large critical value. In particular, A1 has infinitely many critical points. It follows\nfrom [AF08b, Proposition 2.4] that critical points of A1 give rise to leaf-wise intersections.\nMoreover, the map from critical points to leaf-wise intersection points is injective unless there\nexists a leaf-wise intersection on a closed characteristic.
