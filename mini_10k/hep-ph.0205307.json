At low momenta, they directly probe the electric and magnetic charge distribution inside the hadron. In\ngeneral, the form factors are related to the elastic amplitude for a given hadron to absorb a virtual photon. Thus,\none can access the interaction responsible for the recombination of the partons into the hadron.\nThe electro-magnetic form factors of the nucleon are currently subject to a renewed experimental interest. At\nlow momenta, the proton electric and magnetic form factors can be very well described by the same dipole fit,\n2 2\n) , where Mdip = 0.84 GeV. For larger momenta (Q2 & 2 GeV2 ), however, recent\nGpE(M) dip = e(\u03bc)/(1 + Q2 /Mdip\nmeasurements at JLab show that the electric form factor falls off faster than the magnetic one [1, 2]. On the other\nhand, the electric form factor of the neutron has been measured up to Q2 \u2248 2 GeV2 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. It was found\nto be positive, which indicates an inhomogeneous distribution of the positive and the negative charge in the neutron,\nwith the positive charge concentrated near the center.\nFrom the theoretical point of view, the nucleon form factor is one of the few hadronic quantities of fundamental\nimportance. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts power asymptotics G \u223c 1/Q4 [10] related to the minimal number\n(two) of exchanged gluons, which agrees with data. However, the coefficient which is related to the so-called light\ncone nucleon wave function (see e.g. [11]) does not agree with the pQCD asymptotics. This gives rise to the question\nwhether it is actually described by pQCD at all in the experimentally reached region.\nThe situation for the charged pion form factor is similar. The power of Q matches pQCD, but the coefficient does\nnot, although it is well known asymptotically. Therefore, it must be produced by some non-perturbative effect. In\nour recent paper [12], we have calculated the instanton contribution to the pion form factor using the simplest single\ninstanton approximation (SIA). This led to a very good description of the data, without any new parameters involved.\nIn fact, the only relevant parameter is the average instanton size in the QCD vacuum. We further found that the\ncontribution from a single instanton exceeds the one of asymptotic pQCD in a rather wide region Q2 . 10 GeV2\naccessible to current experiments. Moreover, the form factor of the pion was found to follow closely the well-known\nvector dominance monopole expression.\nIt is the guiding motivation of the current investigation to see whether the dipole form of the proton electric form\nfactor can also be explained using instantons. One possible motivation comes from the similarity between the pion\nand the scalar diquark channel, i.e., the ud content of the nucleon. This similarity becomes exact in two color QCD\nand approximate (up to a factor 1/2) for three colors in the instanton context (see e.g. the discussion in [13]).\nMore formally, we find that the nucleon form factor also receives contributions from maximally enhanced instanton\ndiagrams with two zero modes. In contrary, e.g., the form factor of the delta does not receive similar maximal\ninstanton contributions. In fact, in the SIA it vanishes. As the main result of this investigation, we indeed find that\nthe proton electric form factor at intermediate momentum transfer Q2 \u223c 1 \u2212 4 GeV2 is well reproduced by the single\ninstanton contribution with the same standard parameters of the instanton ensemble.\nThere are a number of other interesting questions which emerge from the experimental information on the proton\nform factors. For example, one would like to understand why the low Q2 data for both GpE (Q2 ) and GpM (Q2 ) follow\nthe same dipole fit. In the case of the pion form factor, the success of the monopole fit can be understood in terms\nof vector meson dominance. However, there is not such a simple picture which can explain the dipole behavior of the\nproton form factors, although the mass in the dipole fit, Mdip , is close to the vector meson mass.\nThere are also interesting theoretical questions arising form the data for the neutron form factor. The fact that\nthe electric form factor is non-zero is a clean signature that a naive non-relativistic quark model description based on\n\n\f2\nSU (6) symmetry is inadequate for the dynamic properties of the nucleon. It is then remarkable that such a picture\nworks so well in describing the neutron to proton magnetic moment ratio. Clearly, in order to solve this puzzle, we\nneed to understand what is the main source of SU (6) breaking in the neutron wave function.\nSuch questions have been addressed in a number of phenomenological models as well as in lattice simulations [14, 15].\nIn particular, we discuss two recent works which are related to our analysis. Dong et al. calculated the proton\nand neutron form factors in lattice QCD and studied the sea quark contribution [16] which is due to disconnected\ndiagrams. It was found that the proton electric form factor can be very well reproduced by the connected components\nof the relevant Green functions, with the contribution of the sea being negligible. On the other hand, the connected\ncontribution accounts for roughly only half of the neutron electric form factor. Therefore, their analysis shows that\nthe sea cannot account for the entire SU (6) breaking observed in the neutron wave function.\nMa et al. considered a different source of SU (6) breaking [17]. They calculated the form factors of the nucleon in a\nsimple quark-diquark model, in which relativistic covariance is enforced by using the light front dynamics formalism.\nIn this model, they considered trial wave functions depending on phenomenological parameters, which were fixed in\norder to reproduce the static properties of the nucleon. By varying such parameters, they could tune the amount of\nSU (6) breaking in their valence picture. They found that such a simple model can reproduce very well the existing\ndata for the form factors of the nucleon up to Q2 \u223c 2 GeV2 . Moreover, in this model, the ratio GpE /GpM at high\nmomenta is a consequence of the relativistic correlation between the spin and the momentum of the constituents.\nWe now come back and discuss the significance of the instanton contribution to the neutron and proton electric form\nfactors. Instantons are topologically non-trivial solutions of the Euclidean Yang-Mills equation of motion. Physically,\nthey describe tunneling events in the QCD vacuum and are associated with strong non-perturbative color fields. Form\nfactors are amplitudes of a hadron retaining its identity after large momentum transfers and the strong fields of the\ninstantons may transfer momentum between several quarks at once. Furthermore, instanton zero modes lead to a\nspecial importance of instantons for any problems involving light fermions, especially in spin-zero channels such as\npions or diquarks.\nIn the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) (for a review see [18]), the QCD partition function is assumed to be saturated\nby an ensemble of instantons and anti-instantons of a typical size, \u03c1 \u2248 1/3 fm, and a typical density, n \u2248 1 fm\u22124 . Previous works have shown that the ILM describes quantitatively the spectrum of the light mesons [19] and baryons [20].\nThe instanton induced interaction is effective only between quarks of different flavor and chirality. This implies that,\nin the nucleon, only two quarks can be bound by the 't Hooft interaction, while the third one is more loosely bound.\nIndeed, it was shown [20] that the u and d quark in the nucleon form a bound state, a scalar diquark with a mass\ncomparable to that of a constituent quark. This analysis provided a microscopic motivation for the quark-diquark\nmodel of the nucleon.\nThere are, however, some differences between the quark-diquark picture which emerges from the ILM and the\nsimplest phenomenological model described above. For example, Ma et al. considered a nucleon wave function with\nan equal mixture of a scalar and a vector diquark [17], while the 't Hooft interaction generates a scalar diquark only.\nMoreover, in [17], the diquark is treated as a point-like particle, while in the ILM its size has been estimated to be\napproximately 0.4 fm [21]. Finally, in the ILM it is possible to account for the contribution of the meson cloud and\nthe sea quarks simultaneously, both contributing to the SU (6) symmetry breaking of the nucleon wave function.\nIn a previous work, two of the authors calculated the proton electro-magnetic three-point function in coordinate\nspace [21] both from numerical simulations in the ILM, i.e., including multi-instanton effects, and analytically in the\nSIA. The Green function evaluated theoretically was then compared to a phenomenological one derived from the\nFourier transform of several parametrizations of the experimental data. This approach had the advantage to consider\nlarge-sized correlation functions, for which the contribution of the continuum of excitations was certainly negligible.\nHowever, such a procedure has the shortcoming that it does not allow a direct comparison to the experimental\ndata. From a theoretical point of view, the main result was that the proton electro-magnetic three-point function is\ncompletely dominated by the contribution of a single instanton, up to surprisingly large distances of \u2248 1.8 fm. From\na phenomenological point of view, it was shown that the ILM predictions are consistent with a deviation of GpE from\nthe dipole fit. This is in nice agreement with the result obtained by Ma et al. in their simple model.\nIn the present work we develop a much simpler single instanton calculation, based on the time-momentum correlators used in [12] and [22]. Such a scheme accounts for the leading single instanton effects. The calculation is physically\nvery transparent and presents several analogies with perturbation theory. Moreover, we compare directly to the experimental data. In the pion and nucleon channel, the single instanton contribution is certainly dominant for hadronic\nprocesses at intermediate momenta, Q2 \u2265 1 GeV2 . Moreover, it constitutes the relevant gluonic configurations, which\ntake over with the breakdown of perturbation theory.\nWe have not calculated the contribution of the quark sea (the disconnected diagrams) to the form factor, but argue\nit to be small, roughly \u223c 1/10 of the proton form factor and half of the neutron form factor. We will proceed by\ndescribing the details of our calculation. In section III, we show our results and close by discussing the physical\nimplications.\n\n\f3\nII.\n\nCALCULATIONAL SETUP\n\nFor the determination of the electric form factors of the nucleon, we follow the method used in the calculation of\nthe charged pion electro-magnetic form factor [12]. In the wall-to-wall (W2W) formalism, the electric form factors\ncan be extracted from a combination of three- to two-point functions. In particular, we choose to work in the Breit\nframe and consider the following spatial Fourier transform of the Euclidean three-point correlator\nZ\nG4 (t, q/2; \u2212t, \u2212q/2) = d3 x d3 y ei q*(x+y)/2 h0| Tr \u03b7sc (t, y) J4 (0, 0) \u03b7\u0304sc (\u2212t, x) \u03b34 |0i.\n(1)\nJ4 is the fourth component of the electro-magnetic current operator and \u03b7s (x) is the so-called nucleon scalar current\nwhich, in the case of the proton, reads 1\n\u03b7s (x) = \u01ebabc [ua (x)C\u03b35 db (x)] uc (x).\nAccordingly, we evaluate the Fourier transform of the nucleon two-point given by\nZ\nG(t, q) = d3 x ei q*x h0| Tr \u03b7sc (t, x) \u03b7\u0304sc (0) \u03b34 |0i.\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nIn both Eq. (1) and (3), the additional \u03b34 has been inserted in order for the correlators to receive maximal singleinstanton contribution (see the discussion in [21] and below).\nFor large Euclidean times, one can isolate the contribution of the lowest lying state to the Green function\np(n)\n\nG4\n\n(t, q/2; \u2212t, \u2212q/2) \u2192 2 \u039b2sc\n\n\u0012\n\nM\n\u03c9q/2\n\n\u00132\n\np(n)\n\nGE\n\n(Q2 ) e\u22122 \u03c9q/2 t ,\n\n(4)\n\np(n)\n\nwhere GE (Q2 ) denotes the proton (neutron) electric form factor and \u039bsc the coupling of the scalar current, Eq. (2),\nto the nucleon. The nucleon pole in the two-point function is similarly reached\nG(t, q) \u2212\u2192 2 \u039b2sc e\u2212\u03c9q t .\n\n(5)\n\nIn order to calculate the instanton contribution to such correlation functions, we use the SIA, which was introduced\nin [23] and studied in detail in [24]. In such an approach, only the contribution from the closest instanton is taken\nexplicitly into account, while the effects of the other instantons are incorporated in two induced parameters, the quark\neffective mass, m\u22c6 \u2248 85 MeV, and the average instanton density, n\u0304 \u2248 1 fm\u22124 .\nThe quark propagator in the instanton background is known exactly [25] and consists of a zero-mode part and a\nI\nI\nnon-zero mode part, S I (x, y) = Szm\n(x, y) + Snzm\n(x, y). We showed that the SIA is reliable only if the relevant Green\nfunctions receive contribution from more than one zero-mode propagator [24]. In fact, the additional \u03b34 matrix in\nEq. (1) and (3) has been inserted in order to guarantee such an enhancement.\nIn this work, we choose to further simplify the calculation by adapting the so called \"zero-mode approximation\",\nI\nin which the non-zero mode part of the propagator is replaced by the free one, S I (x, y) \u2243 Szm\n(x, y) + S0 (x, y). This\napproximation is accurate in the case of the nucleon three- and two-point functions which we are considering [21].\nFinally, it is convenient to work directly in a time-momentum representation for the Green functions. This is achieved\nby using the W2W quark propagators evaluated in [12]. Two typical diagrams contributing to the connected threepoint function, Eq. (1), in the SIA are shown in Fig. 1 (A) and (B). Due to the chiral and flavor structure of the\ninstanton induced interaction, the zero modes are restricted to the u and d quark inside the nucleon. This reduces\nthe possible diagrams to the structure depicted in Fig. 1 (A) and (B) and a similar diagram with the instanton to the\nright. The total contribution is nevertheless still quite involved due to the charge conjugation matrix in the nucleon\ncurrents. The interpretation is that in diagram (A) of Fig. 1 the virtual photon probes the diquark content of the\nnucleon, whereas in diagram (B) the photon interacts with the residually bound quark.\nAfter Wick contraction, the calculation of the three- and two-point functions, Eq. (1) and (3), reduces to evaluating\nthe averages of traces of W2W propagators in the single instanton (and anti-instanton) background. The average\ninvolves an integration over the position, size and color orientation of the instanton. We approximate the instanton\n\n1\n\nWe note that the nucleon scalar current contains explicitly the operator which excites a scalar ud diquark. It is this combination that\ncouples strongly to the instanton zero modes. The corresponding operator for the neutron is obtained through the substitution u \u2194 d.\n\n\f4\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(C)\n\nFIG. 1: Graphical representation of the typical contributions to the W2W nucleon electro-magnetic three point function. The\ndouble lined \"walls\" correspond to the spatial Fourier integration, see [12]. The dashed ellipse denotes the four quark (zeromode) instanton interaction. The nucleon is excited at the left, struck by the virtual photon in the middle and absorbed at\nthe right. Two contributions to the connected three-point function are shown. Diagram (A) probes the diquark content of\nthe nucleon, whereas in diagram (B), the photon interacts with the remaining quark. Diagram (C) is disconnected, where the\nphoton probes the sea quark content of the nucleon.\n\nsize distribution to be simply d(\u03c1) = n\u0304 \u03b4(\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u0304), with a typical instanton density, n\u0304 = 1 fm\u22124 , and a typical instanton\nsize, \u03c1\u0304 = 1/3 fm taken from the ILM.2 In general, Wick contracting generates connected as well as disconnected\naverages.\nThe disconnected contribution, Fig. 1 (C), requires some discussion. Physically, it corresponds to the effects of\nthe sea quarks on the form factor. In perturbation theory, this contribution is subleading at large Q due to the\nadditional gluon exchange required to transfer momentum from the struck sea quark to the valence one. In the\ninstanton background field, this momentum transfer can occur via the instanton field itself 3 and also leads to an\nextra suppression at large Q. The total momentum flowing into the sea quark loop q has to be transferred to the\nvalence quarks, which leads to an extra \"instanton form factor\" exp(\u2212\u03c1 |q|) from the non-zero mode propagator in\nthe sea quark loop. This small factor appears in addition to the form factors from the zero mode and non-zero mode\npropagators in the valence pieces.4\nUnfortunately, the evaluation of the W2W non-zero mode propagator is extremely involved and we refrain from\ncalculating the contribution of the disconnected diagram, Fig. 1 (C). We will argue below that it is indeed a small\ncontribution to the proton form factor.\nIn this work, we focus on the electric form factors of the proton and the neutron only, as they come from maximally enhanced diagrams. The instanton contribution to the magnetic form factors of the nucleon can be extracted\nfrom a different combination of the three- and two-point functions [15, 16], which however receives only subleading\ncontributions from a single instanton.\nOnce the Green functions are evaluated, the electric form factor can in principle be determined from the ratio\nof the three- to two-point correlators in the large Euclidean time limit, t \u2192 \u221e. However, in the approach of this\nwork focused on a single instanton, one cannot choose the time interval to be arbitrarily large. In fact, as t becomes\ncomparable with the typical distance between instantons, n\u0304\u22121/4 = 1 fm, many-instanton effects should begin to play a\nnon-negligible role and the SIA will eventually break down. The SIA calculation of the three- and two-point functions\nare compared to numerical simulations in the ILM in [21]. We verified that the SIA calculation of the two-point\ncorrelator, Eq. (3), is reliable up to distances of \u2248 0.9 fm. On the other hand, we found that the single instanton\ncontribution to the three-point function, Eq. (1), saturates the ILM results up to much larger distances of \u2248 1.8 fm.\nIn order to access the proton and neutron form factors, we need to ensure that, at the largest value of the Euclidean\ntime allowed by the SIA, the nucleon pole is reasonably isolated in both the two- and three-point correlation functions.\nThis was assured for the pion, essentially due to the large separation from its resonances. For the nucleon, this is\na more delicate task, because the first resonance with the same quantum numbers, N (1440), is only a few hundred\nMeV heavier than the ground state. This implies that larger time intervals are needed to separate their contributions.\nTherefore, it is a priori not guaranteed that there is a window, in which the SIA is reliable and the nucleon is isolated\n\n2\n\n3\n4\n\nIn [12], we evaluated the pion form factor using different parametrizations of the instanton size distribution. We found that the\npredictions obtained from such a simple delta-function ansatz agree within 10% with those obtained using a parametrization of the\nlattice results for d(\u03c1).\nThe chiral structure of the instanton interaction requires a non-zero mode propagator for the sea quark loop. The free propagator used\nin the zero-mode approximation would lead to a vanishing contribution.\nThese go as exp(\u2212\u03c1 |q|/6) since every valence quark has a total momentum |q|/6 on average in the Breit frame.\n\n\f0.08\n\n1.6\n\n0.07\n\n1.5\n\n0.06\n\n1.4\n\nM [GeV]\n\nLambda sc [GeV 3]\n\n5\n\n0.05\n\n1.3\n\n0.04\n\n1.2\n\n0.03\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n0.02\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\nt [fm]\n\nt [fm]\n\nFIG. 2: The scalar coupling to the nucleon, \u039bsc , (left) and the nucleon mass (right) evaluated from the SIA two-point function\nfor different Euclidean times. The shaded area in the left figure represents the range of values of \u039bsc obtained from quenched\nand unquenched lattice simulations, e.g. [26].\n\nfrom its resonances.\nIn Fig. 2, we show the SIA results for the nucleon coupling and mass, obtained from a fit of the two-point function,\nEq. (3), retaining only the ground state in the spectral decomposition, as in Eq. (5). We find that a plateau, which\nindicates the complete isolation of the proton signal, is obtained for t & 1 fm. Moreover, as t becomes larger than\n1.3 fm, the single instanton contribution rapidly dies out and the approximation breaks down. Unfortunately, on the\nbasis of the analysis developed in [21], we estimate the maximal time interval for which we can trust our two-point\nfunction SIA calculation to be t \u2248 0.9 fm.5 This implies that, in our calculation, the nucleon is not completely isolated\nand we expect a small contamination of the correlation functions from excited states. From the two plots in Fig. 2,\nwe estimate that such effects result in corrections of the order of 10%.\nWe extract the electric form factors from the ratio\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c9q/2 (t) 2 Gp(n)\n(t, q/2, \u2212t, \u2212q/2, t)\np(n)\n4\n2 \u039b2sc (t)\n(6)\n\u2192 GE (Q2 ),\nM (t)\n(G(t, q/2))2\np\nwhere \u039bsc (t), M (t) and \u03c9q/2 (t) = q2 /4 + M (t)2 denote the values extracted from a fit of the two point function\nG(t, q/2) keeping only the nucleon contribution in the spectral decomposition. The ratio of G4 (2t)/G(t)2 ensures\nthat both correlators can be calculated reliably in the SIA. The two factors of the two-point function are needed to\nsustain the nucleon pole over the total Euclidean distance 2 t with a necessary t = 0.9 fm. It corresponds to the\nleading order in a virial expansion in the instanton density. This procedure is at the expense of a dependence on\nthe multi-instanton induced parameters, namely the quark effective mass m\u22c6 and the average instanton density n\u0304, or\nequivalently a dependence on the nucleon coupling \u039bsc and mass. For the pion form factor, it could be achieved that\nsuch a dependence cancels in the calculation, with only the average instanton size \u03c1\u0304 remaining.\nIn Fig. 3, we give the resulting proton electric form factor in the SIA, obtained for different values of the Euclidean\ntime. We observe that our outcome is nearly independent on the chosen time interval restricted to the SIA window. This indicates a cancellation between the small contribution from the excited states to the numerator and the\ndenominator in Eq. (6).\nIII.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe aim of the present calculation is to show that the dipole behavior of the proton electric form factor can be\nexplained from the interaction of the quarks with the field of a single instanton. Our final result for GpE is presented\n\n5\n\nWe note that the total time interval in the three-point function is given by 2 t.\n\n\f6\n\n0.4\nt=0.9 fm\nt=0.8 fm\nt=0.7 fm\n\nGpE(Q 2)\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 3: The proton electric form factor GpE as a function of Euclidean time t. Although the relevant Green functions receive a\ncontribution from the excited states of the order of 10%, for t = 0.9 fm, the form factor is independent of t.\n\nin Fig. 4 in comparison with the dipole fit.6 The results show that the instanton-induced contribution can account for\nthe correct magnitude of GpE . Thus, it should be included in any dynamical model. Whether there is indeed a direct\nrelation between the nucleon form factor and instantons in the QCD vacuum can be further tested on the lattice, in\nmany ways and on a configuration-per-configuration basis. We do not wish to claim that the SIA results have the\naccuracy to explain the high Q2 precision data for the ratio of GpE /GpM . However, much more involved numerical\nsimulations have shown that the ILM is consistent with the high momentum deviation of the proton electric form\nfactor from the dipole fit [21].\nThe result for the neutron form factor is presented in Fig. 5 in comparison to the available experimental data and\nthe lattice results of Dong et al. [16]. As expected, the presence of a massive diquark generates an inhomogeneous\ncharge distribution and leads to a positive form factor. However, in the instanton model, the masses of the scalar\ndiquark and the constituent quark are not that different, which leads to a small neutron form factor. Furthermore,\nwe observe that the connected component of the Green function accounts for roughly half of the form factor only.\nThis is in qualitative agreement with lattice results, which also found that half of the neutron form factor comes from\nthe disconnected diagrams we have neglected in the present calculation. This provides an estimate for its value and\nsupports our assumptions that it is small compared to the proton form factor. In the instanton model it is subleading\nas explained above.\nSummarizing, we have computed the single instanton contribution to nucleon electric form factors. We have carried\nout the calculations analytically in a window of momentum transfer in which the single instanton approximation\ncan be used. The range of validity of the SIA for the nucleon was found to correspond to momentum transfers\nQ2 \u223c 1 \u2212 4 GeV2 . At smaller Q2 , multi-instanton effects appear, and at larger Q2 , there are admixtures of excited\nstates (see the discussion in [22]). Already the existence of such a window for the nucleon in the SIA is highly\nnon-trivial due to the presence of a rich and close spectrum of excited states. The only other hadron for which this\nwas shown to be the case is the pion [12]. The physical reason is that the (single) instanton induces a compact\nquark-diquark structure of the nucleon. Other baryons, such as the decouplet members, do not have such a structure\nand thus are expected to have smaller form factors. For numerical results we used the standard parameters of the\ninstanton ensemble [23], fixed 20 years ago. A similar analysis of the proton to delta transition form factors is in\npreparation [27].\n\n6\n\nAt large momenta, the electric form factor of the proton is experimentally less well resolved than both its ratio to the magnetic one and\nthe magnetic form factor itself. From the measurements at JLab [1, 2], one finds that at Q2 \u223c 1 \u2212 4 GeV2 the electric form factor is\nreduced by about 20 \u2212 50% relative to the magnetic one, whereas the magnetic form factor is still reproduced by the dipole fit very well.\n\n\f7\n\n0.4\nSIA\ndipole fit\n\nGpE(Q 2)\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n5\n\n6\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nFIG. 4: The proton electric form factor evaluated in the SIA (points) compared to the dipole fit (dashed line).
