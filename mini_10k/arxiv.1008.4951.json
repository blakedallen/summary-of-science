This\nproperty of \"flux-freezing\" involves an implicit assumption, however, that plasma fluid velocities remain smooth\nin the limit of vanishing resistivity. This assumption need\nnot be valid if the viscosity vanishes together with the\nresistivity, at a fixed or a decreasing magnetic Prandtl\nnumber. At the implied high Reynolds numbers, smooth\nlaminar plasma flows will be unstable to the development\nof turbulence. We have argued previously that magnetic\nflux-conservation in its usual sense cannot hold at any\nsmall resistivities, no matter how tiny, in a turbulent\nplasma with a Kolmogorov-like energy spectrum [2]. Neither is flux-freezing completely broken but, instead, it\nbecomes intrinsically stochastic due to the roughness of\nthe advecting velocity field [3, 4]. Infinitely-many magnetic field lines are carried to each point-even in the\nlimit of very high conductivity-which must be averaged\nto obtain the resultant magnetic field at that point.\nThe previous ideas are theoretical predictions for turbulent flows of astrophysical and laboratory plasmas.\nHowever, they are exact properties of at least one soluble problem of turbulent advection, the KazantsevKraichnan (KK) model of kinematic magnetic dynamo.\nSee [5\u20137] and many following papers [8\u201316]. In that\nmodel the physical turbulent velocity field is replaced\nby a Gaussian random field that is white-noise in time\nand rough (H\u00f6lder continuous) in space. It is rigorously\nestablished for this model that Lagrangian particle trajectories are \"spontaneously stochastic\" in the limit of\ninfinite Reynolds numbers, with an infinite ensemble of\ntrajectories for a given advecting velocity field and a\n\n\u2217\n\neyink@jhu.edu\n\ngiven initial particle position [17\u201324]. This remarkablebreakdown of Laplacian determinism is a consequence of\nthe properties of two-particle Richardson diffusion [25],\nwhich are also expected to hold for real fluid turbulence.\nThe stochastic nature of flux-freezing must play an essential role in the turbulent magnetic dynamo at high kinetic Reynolds numbers, either for fixed or for vanishing\nmagnetic Prandtl numbers. The zero Prandtl-number\nfluctuation dynamo was studied in an earlier work of\nEyink and Neto [26], hereafter referred to as I, primarily for the KK model. This model undergoes a remarkable transition as the scaling exponent \u03be of the velocity\nstructure function is decreased, with dynamo effect disappearing for \u03be < 1 in space dimension three. This seems\nrather counterintuitive, because velocity-gradients and\nline-stretching rates in the model increase as \u03be is lowered,\nwhich should favor dynamo action. Paper I showed that\nthe stochasticity of flux-freezing is fundamental to understand this transition. Although magnetic line-stretching\nrates indeed increase for decreasing \u03be, the resultant magnetic field at a point is the average of infinitely-many field\nlines advected to that point from a large spatial volume.\nAs shown in I, the correlations between independent linevectors are small for \u03be < 1, when the velocity field is too\nrough, and the net magnetic field decays despite the rapid\ngrowth in strength of individual field lines.\nThe contribution of flux-line stochasticity to turbulent\ndynamo action for \u03be > 1 was not fully explicated in I,\nhowever. Infinitely-many field lines are advected to each\npoint from a large spatial volume, e.g. with diameter\nof order the velocity integral length L in one turbulent\nturnover time L/urms . But all of these field lines are unlikely to make an equal contribution to dynamo action.\nIn particular, field vectors that arrive to the same point\nfrom very distant initial locations must be poorly correlated and give small (or negative) dynamo effect. It\nis not hard to guess that dynamo action in the limit of\n\n\f2\nhigh-Reynolds number Lurms /\u03bd \u001d 1 and low Prandtl\nnumber \u03bd/\u03b7 \u001c 1 must arise mainly from vectors with\ninitial separation distances r of order \u223c `\u03b7 , the resistive\nlength. Indeed, this is the only available length-scale in\nthat limit, on dimensional grounds. The exact contribution to fluctuation dynamo from vectors with initial\nseparation r remains unknown, however, even in the KK\nmodel. One of the main purposes of this paper to provide\na quantitative answer to this problem.\n\nAnother important issue left unresolved in I was the\noutcome of a spatially-uniform initial magnetic field in\nthe dynamo regime of the KK model for \u03be > 1. Can\nsuch a magnetic field provide the seed for a small-scale\nfluctuation-dynamo? This question is very closely connected with the proper formulation of the concept of\n\"magnetic induction\" . This process is usually defined\nas the creation of small-scale magnetic fluctuations by\nthe turbulent \"shredding\" of a non-zero mean magnetic\nfield and has been invoked to explain small-scale magnetic fluctuations in liquid metal experiments [27\u201331], in\nrelated numerical simulations [32, 33], and at the solar\nsurface [34, 35]. It is frequently suggested that this process is distinct from fluctuation dynamo. For example,\nSchekochihin et al. wrote: \"Given a multiscale observed\nor simulated magnetic field, one does not generally have\nenough information (or understanding), to tell whether\nit has originated from the fluctuation dynamo, from the\nmean-field dynamo plus the turbulent induction or from\nsome combination of the two.\" [33] However, if a mean\nmagnetic field can provide a seed for fluctuation dynamo,\nis there really any meaningful physical distinction between the two mechanisms? Or if magnetic induction\nis defined instead as a process that occurs only in the\nabsence of fluctuation dynamo, as it sometimes is, then\nhow can one regard the two processes as acting in \"combination\"? Clearly there is some conceptual confusion in\nthe literature about the proper definition of magnetic induction. We shall use our exact results in the KK model\nto discuss these issues and, also, to evaluate some the\nproposed theories of the induced magnetic spectrum.\n\nThe contents of this paper are as follows. In section II\nwe provide more detailed background to our work and\na more formal statement of the problems to be studied. In section III we study the Lagrangian mechanism of\nthe fluctuation dynamo at zero Prandtl number and the\nquantitative role of stochastic flux-freezing. A first subsection III A presents exact mathematical analysis and\nthe second subsection III B gives numerical results. The\nnext section IV discusses the problem of magnetic induction using our analytical results for the KK model. We\ndraw our final conclusions in section V. Appendices A\nand B present some technical material.\n\nII.\n\nBACKGROUND AND PROBLEM\nSTATEMENT\n\nWe begin this section with a summary of the key results\nof Paper I. A \"dynamo order-parameter\" was introduced\nthere with purely geometric significance. Let x(a, t) be a\nstochastic Lagrangian trajectory, satisfying\np\ndx = u(x, t)dt + 2\u03b7 dW(t), x(t0 ) = a.\n(1)\nWe shall assume in this section that the advecting velocity field is incompressible, \u2207*u = 0, as in I. W(t) in (1)\nis a vector Brownian motion and \u03b7 is the resistivity (or,\nin fact, the magnetic diffusivity). Let `k (a, t) be a passive vector starting as a unit vector \u00eak at space point a\nand time t0 and subsequently transported along x(a, t),\nstretched and rotated by the velocity-gradient. That is,\n`k (a, t) = \u00eak *\u2207a x(a, t).\n\n(2)\n\nThen I introduced the quantity\nRk` (r, t) = h`k (a, t)*`0` (a0 , t)\u03b4 3 (x(a, t) \u2212 x0 (a0 , t))i, (3)\nwith r = a \u2212 a0 , where h*i denotes average over the turbulent velocity realizations, (*) denotes average over the\nrandom Brownian motions and 0 indicates a second, independent realization of the latter. This quantity measures\nnot only the magnitude but also the angular correlation of independent line-vectors that start as unit vectors\n`k (a, t0 ) = ek , `0` (a0 , t0 ) = e` at points a, a0 separated by\ndisplacement r, which end at the same point at time t.\nNow let B be a magnetic field kinematically transported by the random velocity field u and diffused by\nresistivity \u03b7:\n\u2202t B + (u*\u2207)B = (B*\u2207)u + \u03b74B,\n\nB(t0 ) = B(0) . (4)\n\nAs shown in I, the mean energy in this magnetic field can\nbe expressed as\nZ\n2\nk\n`\nhB (t)i = d3 r Rk` (r, t)hB(0)\n(r)B(0)\n(0)i.\n(5)\nIt has been assumed in deriving (5) that initial conditions on the magnetic field are statistically independent\nof the velocity and that both quantities are statistically\nhomogeneous (space translation-invariant). This formula\nmakes clear the close relation of dynamo action to the\nline-correlation (3), which grows exponentially rapidly\nprecisely in the dynamo regime.\nThis connection was verified in I by an exact calculation of the line-correlation (3) in the soluble KazantsevKraichnan (KK) model of turbulent dynamo [5\u20137, 10\u2013\n16]. This model replaces the true turbulent velocity by a\nGaussian random field which is white-noise in time:\nhui (x, t)uj (x0 , t0 )i = \u03baij (r)\u03b4(t \u2212 t0 )\n\n(6)\n\n0\n\nwith r = x \u2212 x . In this model, the magnetic correlation\nfunction\nC ij (r, t) = hB i (r, t)B j (0, t)i\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nevolves according to a closed, linear equation\nk`\n\u2202t C ij = Mij\nk` C ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere M is a singular diffusion operator. If \u03baij (r) \u223c r\u03be\nfor small r, with rugosity exponent 0 < \u03be < 2, then the\nvelocity realizations are rough in space and provide a\nqualitatively good model of turbulent advection. It was\nshown in I that Rk` (r, t) in the KK model is the solution\nof the adjoint equation\n\u2217\n\u2202t Rk` = Mij\nk` Rij\n\n(9)\n\nwith initial condition Rk` (r, t) = \u03b4k` \u03b4 3 (r). This fact was\nexploited to show that Rk` (r, t) in the KK model at zero\nmagnetic Prandtl number, as expected, grows exponentially in the dynamo regime (\u03be > 1) but has only powerlaw time-dependence in the non-dynamo regime (\u03be < 1).\nThe study in I left open, however, several important\nquestions. First, what range of r = |r| substantially contributes to the correlation R and to the space-integral\nin (5)? It is known in the KK model that magnetic\nfield lines arrive to a point from a spatial region with\nradius L(t) \u223c (t \u2212 t0 )1/(2\u2212\u03be) , in the root-mean-square\nsense. This is also expected for kinematic dynamo in a\n.\nreal turbulent fluid, where \u03be = 4/3 and L(t) \u223c (t \u2212 t0 )3/2\ncorresponds to turbulent Richardson diffusion of the field\nlines. However, not all of the field lines in this large volume should be expected to contribute equally to dynamo\naction. Field vectors starting from points separated by\ndistances r much larger than the resistive length-scale\nmay arrive at the same point with small angular correlations and thus contribute little to net magnetic field\ngrowth. It follows from the analysis of I for the KK model\nin its dynamo regime that, for times t long compared to\nthe resistive time-scale,\nRk` (r, t) \u223c e\u2212\u03bbt Gek` (r),\n\n(\u03bb < 0)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u2212\u03bb is the largest (positive) eigenvalue of M\u2217 and\nGe is the corresponding (right) eigenmode. Thus, questions about the spatial structure of R reduce, in the exponential growth regime at sufficiently long times, to the\ncorresponding questions about the right eigenmode Ge of\nM\u2217 (or, equivalently, left eigenmode of M). It is one\nof the goals of the present work to calculate this eigenmode and thereby determine the degree of correlation of\nline-vectors arriving from various initial separations.\nA second important issue left unresolved in I was the\nresponse of a spatially uniform initial magnetic field to\nturbulent advection and stretching. In the case of a uniform initial field, formula (5) simplifies to\nk\n`\nhB 2 (t)i = Rk` (t)hB(0)\nB(0)\ni,\n\n(11)\n\nRk` (t) \u2261\n\nBelow we shall demonstrate this fact.\nThis result is closely connected with another important physical problem, the creation of small-scale magnetic fluctuations by turbulent \"magnetic induction\" of\na non-zero mean-field [27\u201333]. Indeed, the formula (11)\napplies directly to this situation, which corresponds to\nk\n`\nk\n`\nthe special case hB(0)\nB(0)\ni = hB(0)\nihB(0)\ni. This observation already makes clear that there is no essential physical distinction between \"fluctuation dynamo\" and \"magnetic induction\", which simply correspond to different\nchoices of initial magnetic field (random vs. deterministic). Other definitions of \"magnetic induction\" are offered in the literature. If the fluctuation dynamo fails to\noperate for some reason (e.g. if the magnetic Reynolds\nnumber is too small), then the term \"magnetic induction\"\nis sometimes used for the process by which small-scale\nfluctuations are generated from the mean magnetic field.\nIf a mean-field dynamo still operates and creates an exponentially growing large-scale magnetic field, then these\n\"parasitic\" small-scale fluctuations may be also exponentially increasing. This provides another mechanism to\nproduce exponential growth of small-scale magnetic fields\nin the absence of a fluctuation dynamo. If instead there\nis no mean-field dynamo, then such growth of small-scale\nfluctuations by \"magnetic induction\" is sub-exponential.\nWe shall discuss below the non-dynamo regime (\u03be < 1)\nof the KK model as a simple example of such \"magnetic\ninduction\" and use it to evaluate some physical theories\nthat have been proposed for the phenomenon.\nWe mention finally one additional motivation to study\nthe left eigenmodes of M. As pointed out in I, these have\na physical interpretation as correlators of the magnetic\nvector potential A. More precisely, the correlation function defined by\nGk` (r, t) = hAk (r, t)A` (0, t)i,\n\n(14)\n\nin the KK model satisfies\n\u2217\n\u2202t Gk` = Mij\nk` Gij ,\n\n(15)\n\nwith diffusion operator adjoint to that in eq.(8). The underlying reason for this\nR fact is the conservation of magnetic helicity H = d3 r A*B for the ideal induction\nequation. If the latter is written as\n\u2202t B = LB,\n\n(16)\n\nfor a linear operator L (depending on the velocity u),\nthen helicity conservation is equivalent to\n\nwith\nZ\n\nThe quantity (12) measures the correlation of two independent line-vectors that arrive at the same point, regardless of their initial separation. The result (10) does\nnot imply exponential growth of this integrated correlation, however, unless one can show that\nZ\nd3 r Gek` (r) 6= 0.\n(13)\n\nd3 r Rk` (r, t) = h`k (t)*`0` (t)i0 .\n\n(12)\n\n\u2202t A = \u2212L\u2217 A,\n\n(17)\n\n\f4\nup to addition of a gradient term. Different operators L\nare possible, which coincide in their action on solenoidal\nmagnetic fields (\u2207*B = 0), but whose adjoints L\u2217 correspond to different gauge choices for A. Equation (17)\ndirectly implies (15) in the KK model. The addition of\nresistivity to eqs. (16), (17) does not change this result,\nsince the additional Laplacian operator is self-adjoint.\n\nIII.\n\nFLUCTUATION DYNAMO\n\nWe study in this section the Lagrangian mechanism of\nthe fluctuation dynamo in the KK model for three spacedimensions (3D) and for homogeneous and isotropic\nstatistics of both velocity and magnetic fields. We begin in the first subsection III A with exact mathematical\nanalysis of the problem. Most of this discussion applies\nto a fairly general situation, allowing for compressibility\nand helicity of the velocity field. We then specialize to the\ncase of an incompressible, non-helical advecting velocity,\nwith a power-law space-correlation corresponding to an\ninfinite-Reynolds-number inertial-range range for the velocity field. In the second subsection III B we present numerical results for this latter case and discuss their physical interpretation.

(23)\nOne may further write equations in the KK model for\nthe joint correlations of magnetic and vector-potentials\n\nMathematical Analysis\n\nWe discuss two natural choices for the linear operator\nL in the ideal induction eq.(16) and the corresponding\nadjoint operators L\u2217 and gauge choices for the vector\npotential, successively in the following two subsections.\n\n1.\n\nBoldyrev, Cattaneo and Rosner in [14] developed an elegant formulation of the KK model based on the eq.(18)\nfor the case of homogeneous and isotropic statistics. We\nreview their formulation-hereafter referred to as the\nBCR formalism-in Appendix A, paying special attention to issues of gauge-invariance. Readers not previously\nfamiliar with the work of [14] may wish to review that\nappendix before proceeding. One essential observation of\nBCR is that the evolution operator for magnetic correlations factorizes as M = DJ . More precisely, in the KK\nmodel starting from eq.(18)\n\nGauge I\n\n\u03a8i k (r, t) = hB i (r, t)Ak (0, t)i, \u03a8k i (r, t) = hAk (r, t)B i (0, t)i\nusing the operator Ri,k = \u000fipk \u2202p , in terms of which the\noperator D itself factorizes as Dij,k` = Ri,k Rj,` . Then\n\u2202t \u03a8i n = \u2212(Ri,m )\u2217 Jmn,pq Rq,` \u03a8p `\n\u2202t \u03a8mj = \u2212(Rj,n )\u2217 Jmn,pq Rp,k \u03a8k q\n\n(24)\n\nFinally, the vector-potential correlation in (14) obeys\nrs,pq\n\u2202t Gk` = (M\u2217 )pq\nGpq\nk` Gpq = Jk`,rs D\n\nOne choice to write the induction equation is as\n\u2202t B = \u2207\u00d7(u\u00d7B \u2212 \u03b7\u2207\u00d7B).\n\n(18)\n(2)\nLu B\n\nNote that in the ideal equation with \u03b7 = 0,\n=\n\u2212\u2207\u00d7(u\u00d7B) is the Lie-derivative acting on B as a differential 2-form. See [36], eq.(2.3) for \u2207*B = 0. Thus,\nthis form of the induction equation is most directly connected with the conservation of magnetic flux through\nadvected 2-dimensional surfaces. The corresponding adjoint equation for the vector potential is\n\u2202t A = u\u00d7(\u2207\u00d7A) \u2212 \u03b7\u2207\u00d7(\u2207\u00d7A)\n= \u2212(u*\u2207)A + (\u2207A)u\n+\u03b7[4A \u2212 \u2207(\u2207*A)].\n\n(19)\n\nIn the gauge-choice implied by this equation, pure-gauge\nfields A = \u2207\u03bb satisfy \u2207(\u2202t \u03bb) = 0 and are, thus, timeindependent up to possible spatially constant terms.\n\n(25)\n\nwith M\u2217 = J D.

(26)\n\nBCR mainly considered the isotropic sector of the KK\nmodel, invariant under proper rotations but not necessarily space reflections. In that case, with r\u0302 = r/r,\n\u03baij (r) = \u03baL (r)r\u0302i r\u0302j + \u03baN (r)(\u03b4 ij \u2212 r\u0302i r\u0302j ) + \u03baH (r)\u000fijk r\u0302k ,\nwhere \u03baL , \u03baN , and \u03baH = rg are conventional longitudinal, transverse and helical correlation functions, with\nsimilar representations of C, G, etc. However, ref.[14] introduced instead a specialPbasis to expand tensor corre3\nlation functions, as C ij = a=1 Ca \u03beaij with\n1\n1\n1\n\u03be1ij = \u221a (\u03b4 ij \u2212 r\u0302i r\u0302j ), \u03be2ij = r\u0302i r\u0302j , \u03be3ij = \u221a \u000fijk r\u0302k ,\nr\n2r\n2r\n\n\f5\nso that\nC1 =\n\n\u221a\n\n2rCN , C2 = rCL , C3 =\n\n\u221a\n\n2rCH .\n\nThe special feature of this basis is that the Hilbert-space\ninner-product defined by\nZ\nhG, Ci = d3 r Gij (r)C ij (r)\nsimplifies in the isotropic sector to\nZ \u221e\ndr [G1 C1 + G2 C2 + G3 C3 ].\nhG, Ci = 4\u03c0\n0\n\nWe hereafter use the notation C, G etc. in the BCR formalism for the isotropic sector to represent the column\nvectors\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nC1\nC = \uf8ed C2 \uf8f8 .\nC3\n\nIn this representation, the operators J and D take the\nsimple forms\n\u221a\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\n2\n\u2202\n\u2212\u2202\nb a 0\nr\nr\nr\n\u221a\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed\n2\n2\nJ = a 0 c , D=\n\u2212 r2\nr \u2202r\n0 c b\n0\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f8,\n0\n1\n1\n4\nr 2 \u2202r r \u2202r r 2\n\nwith\na(r) =\n\n\u221a\n\n2[2\u03b7 + \u03baN (0) \u2212 \u03baN (r)]\n\n\u221a\n\nThis relation is many-to-one.\nSince Ker(R\u2217 ) =\n\u22a5\n\u2217\n[Ran(R)] , the kernel of R consists of the correlations\nof gradient type:\n\u221a\nG1 (r) = 2\u039b0 (r), G2 (r) = r\u039b00 (r),\n(28)\n\nfor a scalar correlation function \u039b. Thus, any solutions\nG of the adjoint equation that differ by such a gradient\nsolution are mapped to the same solution W of (27). This\nfreedom just corresponds to gauge-invariance of W.\nWe next employ this formalism to discuss the right\neigenfunctions C\u03b1 and left eigenfunctions G\u03b1 of M, which\nsatisfy\nMC \u03b1 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1 C\u03b1 , M\u2217 G\u03b1 = \u2212\u03bb\u03b1 G\u03b1 ,\nrespectively. (Of course, for the continuous spectrum of\nthe operators these are generalized eigenfunctions.) Let\nus suppose that one has obtained the eigenfunction W\u03b1\nof the self-adjoint operator S = R\u2217 J R:\nSW\u03b1 = R\u2217 J RW\u03b1 = \u03bb\u03b1 W\u03b1 .\n\nb(r) = 2\u03b7 + \u03baL (0) \u2212 \u03baL (r)\nc(r) =\n\nComparison of eq.(27) in the isotropic sector with the\ngeneral eq.(24) suggests that W is a simple linear transformation of the magnetic-field, vector-potential correlation \u03a8. For this result, and for the derivation of all the\npreceding statements, see Appendix A.\nWe now discuss the solutions of the adjoint problem\n\u2202t G = M\u2217 G = \u2212J RR\u2217 G. Its solutions are likewise related to solutions of (27) by the equation\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0 \u221a\nW = R\u2217 G = \uf8ed \u2212\u2202r G1 + r2\u0001G2 \uf8f8 .\n3\nr2 \u2202r G\nr2\n\n(29)\n\nThen it is not hard to see that\nC\u03b1 = RW\u03b1 , G\u03b1 =\n\n2[g(0) \u2212 g(r)]r.\n\n1\nJ RW\u03b1 .\n\u03bb\u03b1\n\n(30)\n\nThe first result is obvious. To obtain the second, note\nA crucial observation of BCR is that D factorizes as\nthat, with G\u03b1 as defined above,\nD = \u2212RR\u2217 with\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n0 \u221a0\n0\n0 \u221a\n\u2202r\n0\nSW\u03b1 = W\u03b1 .\nR\u2217 G\u03b1 =\n\u2217\n\u03bb\n2\n2\n\uf8f8 , R = \uf8ed \u2212\u2202r\n\uf8f8.\n\u03b1\nR=\uf8ed0 r\n0\n0\nr\n0 0 \u2212 r12 \u2202r r2\n0\n0 r2 \u2202r r12\nIf this result is used to eliminate W\u03b1 in the definition\nof G\u03b1 , then the statement follows. An interesting conAnother important fact is that Ran(R), the range of the\nsequence is that right and left eigenfunctions are related\noperator R, consists of the solenoidal functions C ij that\nvery simply by\nsatisfy \u2202i C ij = \u2202j C ij = 0. Thus, all solenoidal solutions\n1\nof the equation \u2202t C = MC = \u2212RR\u2217 J C can be obtained\nG\u03b1 =\nJ C\u03b1 .\n\u03bb\u03b1\nby solving\n\u2202t W = \u2212R\u2217 J RW\n\n(27)\n\nwith a self-adjoint operator S = R\u2217 J R, and then setting\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u2202 W\n\u221ar 2\n2\n\uf8f8.\nC = RW = \uf8ed\nr W2\n1\n2\n\u2212 r2 \u2202r (r W3 )\n\nNote also that hC\u03b2 , G\u03b1 i = hRW\u03b2 , \u03bb1\u03b1 J RW\u03b1 i =\n1\n\u03bb\u03b1 hW\u03b2 , SW\u03b1 i = hW\u03b2 , W\u03b1 i = \u03b4\u03b1,\u03b2 . Thus, the left and\nright eigenfunctions are biorthogonal.\nOur discussion so far has been fairly general, permitting a compressible velocity field with reflection-nonsymmetric (helical) statistics. However, we now specialize. If space-reflection symmetric statistics are assumed,\n\n\f6\nthen W3 = C3 = G3 = 0. Furthermore, c(r) = 0 in the\noperator J . Thus, the eigenvalue problem (29) reduces\nto a single equation for W2 :\n\u221a\n2\n\u2212\u2202r (b(r)\u2202r W2 ) + 2 [a(r) \u2212 ra0 (r)]W2 = \u03bbW2 .\nr\nThis is a standard Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problem.\nThe relations (30) yield\n\u221a\n2\nC1 = \u2202r W 2 , C 2 =\nW2\n(31)\nr\n(true even in the reflection non-symmetric case) and\n\u221a\n2a(r)\nb(r)\na(r)\nG1 =\nW2 +\n\u2202r W2 , G2 =\n\u2202r W2 .

The plotted correlations represent the contribution to magnetic energy at a given point produced by field\nvectors that arrive from points separated by distance r\ninitially. As one can see, the contribution is quite diffuse\n(in units of the resistive length `\u03b7 ) with fat, stretchedexponential tails.

We suggest here a heuristic explanation. In the left half of Fig. 11 we show a\npair of parallel field-lines separated by r with their initially transverse line-vectors indicated in red. We then\nshow on the right the result of a large-scale fluid motion\nwhich brings the two line-vectors together to the same\npoint, stretched and rotated by the flow. (It is important to understand that the velocity at scales r > `\u03b7\ncannot actually bring the two lines to touch, but only\nwithin distance \u223c `\u03b7 of each other; it is then the action\nof two independent Brownian motions which completes\ntheir transport to the same point.) Around the time of\nfirst contact shown in the figure, the two line-vectors are\npositively correlated. Further rotation by the flow can\neventually produce anti-alignment and negative correlation. The situation is exactly the opposite, however, for\nthe initially longitudinal line-vectors shown in Fig. 12,\nwhich start on the same (or nearly the same) field-line.\nAs these vectors are brought together by a similar fluid\nmotion as before, the line vectors are anti-aligned near\nthe time of first contact. They may then become positively oriented as further rotation and stretching occurs.\nThese geometric considerations may help to explain why,\neN\nfor large enough r, positive alignment dominates in G\ne L . Transverse\nwhile negative alignment dominates in G\nline-vectors seem to be brought together from large distances by mainly lateral advection of field-lines, while\nlongitudinal vectors are brought together by twisting and\nlooping of field-lines.\n\n\f13\nIV.\n\nUNIFORM FIELDS AND MAGNETIC\nINDUCTION\n\nWe now turn to the second question left open in I,\nthe fate of spatially-uniform magnetic seed fields in the\ndynamo regime of the Kazantsev model. This issue is\nclosely related to the problem of \"magnetic induction\",\nwhich is often defined simply as the generation of smallscale magnetic fluctuations by turbulent tangling of the\nlines of a non-vanishing mean-field. In the case of homogeneous statistics-which we only consider in this\npaper-any non-zero average field must be spatially uniform. Thus, the response of a uniform field to homogeneous turbulence is intimately related to that of magnetic\ninduction. In fact, we shall argue that there is no real\ndistinction in this context between \"magnetic induction\"\nand \"fluctuation dynamo\" with a uniform seed field.\nLet us consider then the special case that the initial\nmagnetic-field B(0) is spatially-uniform (but still possibly random). Applying eq.(11) gives the energy in the\nfluctuation field b = B \u2212 hBi to be\nk\n`\nk\n`\nhb2 (t)i = Rk` (t)hB(0)\nB(0)\ni \u2212 \u03b4k` hB(0)\nihB(0)\ni\nk\n`\nk\n`\n= Rk` (t)hb(0) b(0) i + [Rk` (t) \u2212 \u03b4k` ]hB(0) ihB(0)\ni.\n\n(65)\n\nIn the second line of the equation above, one may make\na formal distinction between \"fluctuation dynamo\" represented by the first term and \"magnetic induction\" represented by the second term. However, their asymptotic\ngrowth rates at long times are the same, both given by\nRk` (t) \u223c e\n\n\u2212\u03bbt\n\nif the integral\nGek` \u2261\n\nZ\n\nGek` ,\n\n(\u03bb < 0)\n\nd3 r Gek` (r)\n\nis non-vanishing. We show now that it is indeed non-zero.\nSince the above integral is gauge-invariant, one may\njust as well consider the integral of Gk` (r). Furthermore,\nas long as the turbulent velocity field (but not necessarily\nthe magnetic field) is statistically isotropic, then\nZ\n1\nGk` = d3 r Gk` (r) = GT \u03b4k`\n3\nR\u221e\n2\nwhere GT \u2261 4\u03c0 0 dr r GT (r) and GT (r) = GL (r) +\n2GN (r) is the trace function.

Notice that we have not assumed any\nspecific form of b(r), as long as the dynamo mode exists.\nIn fact, the entire spatial structure of small-scale fluctuations for \"magnetic induction\" is the same as that\nfor \"fluctuation dynamo\" at long times. Both are determined by the same dynamo eigenmode. To see this, we\nnote that the magnetic correlation can be expanded, in\ngeneral, into right eigenmodes of M :\nX\nC ij (r, t) =\nc\u03b1 e\u2212\u03bb\u03b1 t C\u03b1ij (r)\n(66)\n\u03b1\n\nThe expansion coefficients are determined from the initial\nij\n(r) by\ncorrelation C(0)\nZ\nij\nc\u03b1 \u2261 d3 r G\u03b1;ij (r)C(0)\n(r),\n(67)\nusing biorthogonality of right and left eigenmodes C\u03b1 and\nij\nj\ni\nG\u03b1 . If C(0)\n(r) = hB(0)\nB(0)\ni is r-independent, then for the\nk\n`\nground state mode (say \u03b1 = 0) c0 = G0;k` hB(0)\nB(0)\ni =\n1\n2\n3 GT hB(0) i > 0. Thus, with r fixed,\nC ij (r, t) \u223c c0 e\u2212\u03bb0 t C0ij (r),\n\nt \u2192 \u221e.\n\nThe magnetic correlation C ij (r, t) is dominated by the\nleading dynamo eigenmode C0ij (r) with subleading contributions from additional eigenmodes (point spectrum\nof M) if any. There is no essential physical difference between the two cases of \"fluctuation dynamo\"\n(B(0) = b(0) ) and \"magnetic induction\" (B(0) = hB(0) i).\nIt is interesting to consider in (66) also the opposite\nlimit of large r with t fixed. In that case, the result with\nij\nj\ni\ninitial condition C(0)\n(r) = hB(0)\nB(0)\ni is\nj\ni\nC ij (r, t) \u223c hB(0)\nB(0)\ni,\n\nr \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(68)\n\nij\nj\ni\nThis is clearly true for the case C(0)\n(r) = hB(0)\nihB(0)\ni,\nbecause the above limit then corresponds to \"clustering\"\nof the magnetic correlation function. However, the expansion coefficients (67) are linear in the initial correlaij\ntion, so the above result must hold whenever C(0)\n(r) is\nr-independent. The limit (68) comes entirely from the\ncontinuous spectrum of M in the expansion (66) (for\nwhich the sum over \u03b1 is actually an integral), because the\nfinite number of dynamo eigenmodes C\u03b1 associated to the\npoint spectrum of M all have the stretched-exponential\ndecay in (47), with the corresponding value of \u03bb\u03b1 < 0.\nTheir contribution thus vanishes in the large-r limit.\nWe conclude that there is no essential distinction in the\ndynamo regime between \"magnetic induction\" for a uniform mean-field and \"fluctuation dynamo\" for a homogeneous (but random) seed field, since all of their physical behaviors and underlying mechanisms are exactly the\n\n\f14\nsame. Another possible definition of \"magnetic induction\" which is employed in the literature is the growth\nof small-scale fluctuation fields generated from a nonvanishing mean-field, but only in a parameter regime\nwhere the \"fluctuation dynamo\" does not exist. The\nterm is used this way in discussion of liquid-metal laboratory experiments operated at a sub-threshold regime\n[28, 29, 31]. Although such inductive growth of fluctuations is generally sub-exponential, it may be exponential\nif the average magnetic field is itself exponentially growing because of a mean-field dynamo effect. Of course,\nwith this definition, it makes no sense to regard \"magnetic induction\" and \"fluctuation dynamo\" as possible\nco-existing and competing mechanisms for small-scale\nmagnetic field growth.\nWe may consider as an example of this second type\nof \"magnetic induction\" the failed-dynamo regime of the\nKK model for \u03be < 1, at zero Prandtl number and infinite magnetic Reynolds number. Unlike the liquidmetal experiments where fluctuation-dynamo fails be(c)\ncause Rem < Rem , the failure here is due to the extreme\nroughness of the advecting velocity field (see I). This\nmodel problem is not a perfect analogue of the induction phenenoma seen in the experiments. For example,\nwe solve the KK model with velocity integral scale L = \u221e\n(and thus Rem = \u221e) so that the large-scales of our problem are quite different than the non-universal, inhomogeneous and anisotropic conditions seen in experiments.\nAlso, the average field is uniform in the KK model with\nhomogeneous statistics. Since spatially constant fields\nmust be time-independent, we cannot study in this setting induction of an exponentially growing mean-field.\nOn the other hand, the cited experiments [28, 29, 31]\nhave studied the turbulent induction of a near-uniform,\nstationary external field. The analogy with those experiments is close enough that we can test some proposed\ntheories of \"magnetic induction\" in our model situation.\nWe therefore consider in this light several results of I\nfor the failed dynamo regime of the KK model with \u03be < 1.\nIt was found there for the case of spatially-uniform and\nij\nisotropic initial data C(0)\n(r) = A\u03b4 ij that, at long times,\nhB 2 (t)i \u221d `\u03b6\u03b71 (D1 t)|\u03b61 |/\u03b3 ,\n\n(69)\n\nwith\n3 \u03be\n3\n\u03b61 = \u2212 \u2212 +\n2 2 2\n\nr\n\n1\n1 \u2212 \u03be(\u03be + 2)\n3\n\nwhich is negative and decreasing from 0 to \u22122 for 0 <\n\u03be < 1. Thus, the energy in the magnetic fluctuations\nis growing, but only as a power-law in t. These same\nresults hold , in fact, for general uniform initial data of\nij\nj\ni\nthe form C(0)\n(r) = hB(0)\nB(0)\ni. This follows directly from\neq.(11) when the random velocity (but not necessarily\nthe magnetic field) is statistically isotropic and the linecorrelation matrix Rk` (t) = 13 R(t)\u03b4k` .\nPaper I showed further that there are three spatial\nregimes of the magnetic correlation. These are the re-\n\nsistive range:\nCL (r, t) ' A\n\n00\n\n\u0012\n\n`\u03b7\nL(t)\n\n\u0013 \u03b61 \"\n\u0012 \u0013\u03be #\nr\n1\u22122\nr \u001c `\u03b7 , (70)\n`\u03b7\n\nthe quasi-steady, inertial-convective range:\n\u0013 \u03b61\n\u0012\nr\n`\u03b7 \u001c r \u001c L(t),\nCL (r, t) ' A0\nL(t)\n\n(71)\n\nand the very large-scale range:\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u03b3 \u0015\n2\u03b61 (\u03b61 + 3 + \u03be) L(t)\nCL (r, t) ' A 1 \u2212\nr \u001d L(t).\n\u03b3\nr\n(72)\nWe have here defined L(t) \u2261 (D1 t)1/\u03b3 to be a characteristic large length-scale of the magnetic field. Note that\nA0 , A00 are constants numerically proportional to A. Result (70) follows from the formula for \u0393in (\u03c3) on p.26 of\nI, together with the series expansion of the hypergeometric function 2 F1 (eq.(75) in I). Equations (71) and (72)\nfollow from I, eq.(67) for \u03b1 = 0 with \u03c1 \u001c 1 and \u03c1 \u001d 1, respectively. For the last case, the large-argument asymptotics of the Kummer function in [43], eq. 6.13.1(2), is\nemployed to derive the 1/r\u03b3 term.\nThese three ranges all have simple physical descriptions, which are easiest to discuss based on the corresponding magnetic energy spectra obtained by Fourier\ntransform. In the resistive range the result is\nE(k, t) \u221d\n\nhB 2 (t)i \u2212(1+\u03be)\nk\n\u03b7\n\nk \u001d k\u03b7 .\n\n(73)\n\n(Note that \u03b7 = D1 `\u03be\u03b7 .) This is a Golitsyn-like spectrum,\nwith physics exactly like that discussed earlier for the\nresistive range of the dynamo growth modes. This range\nis very universal in the small-P rm limit.\nThe inertial-convective range has energy spectrum\nE(k, t) ' A0 [L(t)]|\u03b61 | k |\u03b61 |\u22121\n\nkL (t) \u001c k \u001c k\u03b7\n\n(74)\n\nwith kL (t) = 2\u03c0/L(t) \u2192 0 as t \u2192 \u221e. This growing\nrange is responsible for the energy increase in (69). It is\n\"quasi-steady\" in the sense that all its statistical characteristics are identical to those in the forced steady-state\n(see [10] and I), with the uniform initial field replacing\nthe role of the external force. The physics involves a\nnontrivial competition of stretching B*\u2207u and nonlinear\ncascade u*\u2207b. If one assumes that \"induction\" of the initial, background field B(0) *\u2207u dominates the stretching,\nthen this is the same physics invoked by Ruzma\u0131\u0306kin and\nShukurov [44] for induced fluctuations. Assuming a balance of the terms (u*\u2207)b ' b*\u2207u ' B(0) *\u2207u, they proposed on dimensional grounds an Ak \u22121 spectrum, with\n2\nA \u221d hB(0)\ni. However, such a spectrum only occurs in\nthe KK model for \u03be = 0. In that case, the cascade term\nu*\u2207b can be represented as an eddy-diffusivity 2D1 and\na balance equation\n\u2202t b \u2212 2D1 4b = B(0) *\u2207u\n\n\f15\n2\npredicts the correct spectrum hB(0)\nik \u22121 . There is no distinction in this case between the inertial-convective range\nand the resistive range with Golitsyn spectrum. For\n0 < \u03be < 1, however, there is an \"anomalous dimension\"\n|\u03b61 | which corrects the dimensional prediction. There is\nno longer any simple, heuristic argument for the magnetic\nspectral exponent in the quasi-steady range, which requires the computation of a non-perturbative zero-mode.\nThe physics involves a nontrivial competition between\ncreation of magnetic energy by stretching and destruction by turbulent cascade to the resistive range.\nFor the very low wavenumber range k \u001c kL (t) one\nmight expect the dimensional argument of Ruzma\u0131\u0306kin\nand Shukurov to work after all and to correctly yield an\nAk \u22121 spectrum. The results in (70)-(72) correspond to a\nmember of the one-parameter family of self-similar decay\nsolutions found in I, with parameter choice \u03b1 = 0. For\nthe general member of this family, the low-wavenumber\nspectrum is of the form Ak \u03b1\u22121 (\"permanence of large\neddies\"; see I), so setting \u03b1 = 0 should naively lead\nto the Ruzma\u0131\u0306kin-Shukurov prediction. But this is not\nthe case. Fourier transformation of the initial uniform\nmagnetic field instead yields a term in the energy spectrum \u221d A\u03b4(k), a delta-function at k = 0. The actual\nenergy spectrum in the low-wavenumber range is found\nby Fourier transforming the second term in (72) to be\n\nE(k, t) ' A0 [L(t)]\u03b3 k 1\u2212\u03be ,\n\nk \u001c kL (t).\n\n(75)\n\nThe simple physics of this range is direct induction from\nthe spatially-constant field via the balance\n\u2202t b = B(0) *\u2207u.\nIndeed, solving this linear Langevin equation yields\n2\nE(k, t) \u221d hB(0)\ni(D1 t)k 2 Eu (k), reproducing the above\nspectrum. Note that [L(t)]\u03b3 = D1 t corresponds to diffusive spectral growth in this range, due to the white-noise\nin time character of the advecting velocity field. The\ntotal energy in this range remains constant in time, however, because shrinking of the range exactly compensates\nfor increase of the energy spectrum. Once the energy\nb2k ' kE(k, t) in an interval around wavenumber k ap2\nproaches the energy hB(0)\ni in the initial uniform field a\nnonlinear cascade begins and that wavenumber k joins\nthe inertial-convective range with spectrum (74).\nThe above argument resembles one which has been invoked to explain a k \u22125/3 spectrum of magnetic energy reported at wavenumbers k < k\u03b7 in some low-P rm liquidmetal experiments [29, 31] and in a related numerical\nsimulation [32]. These works study the induction of an\nimposed magnetic field by a turbulent flow with a Kolmogorov energy spectrum. The argument made by those\nauthors amounts to assuming a balance between induction of the external magnetic field B(0) and convection by\nthe large-scale velocity u(0) (both mean and fluctuating\ncomponents):\nu(0) *\u2207b = B(0) *\u2207u.\n\nThis leads to the prediction that hu2(0) iE(k) '\n2\nhB(0)\niEu (k), so that Eu (k) ' \u03b52/3 k \u22125/3 implies a similar\nmagnetic energy spectrum E(k). We find this argument\nunconvincing. In the first place, large-scale advection\nconserves the energy in magnetic fluctuations. It cannot\ntherefore balance the input from induction of B(0) . If nonlinear cascade can be ignored, then magnetic energy must\nbe expected to grow, as in our result (75) above, and not\nto saturate. Furthermore, if the large-scale sweeping were\nimportant, then it should appear in our balance argument\nfor (75), because the KK model contains such dynamical\nsweeping effects. However, we see that the correct spectrum at very low wavenumbers is obtained by ignoring\nsuch sweeping as irrelevant. This is consistent with the\nresults of Frisch and Wirth [42] for the diffusive range\nof a passive scalar, who emphasized the (nontrivial) fact\nthat sweeping by large-scales plays no role in the balance\nfor that high-wavenumber range. Finally, we note that\nk \u22125/3 is the (Obukhov-Corrsin) spectrum expected for a\npassive scalar in a Kolmogorov inertial-range and not for\na passive magnetic field. The argument of [29, 31, 32]\nthus omits the effects of the small-scale stretching interaction (b*\u2207)u and we know of no good justification for\ndoing so in a steady-state, saturated regime.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe main purpose of this paper was to quantify the\nimportance of stochasticity of flux-line freezing to the\nzero-Prandtl-number turbulent dynamo. It is a rigorous result for the Kazantsev-Kraichnan model that Lagrangian trajectories becomes intrinsically stochastic in\nthe inertial range with velocity roughness exponent \u03be, due\nto Richardson 2-particle turbulent diffusion. In this situation, infinitely-many magnetic lines in the initial seed\nfield at time t0 are brought to a point at time t from a region of size L(t) \u223c (t\u2212t0 )1/(2\u2212\u03be) . Note that the size of the\nregion sampled is independent of the resistivity. Not all of\nthe magnetic field lines in this large region will, however,\nmake an equal contribution to the net dynamo growth\nof magnetic energy. The contribution from lines initially\nseparated by distance r is quantified, in isotropic nonhelical turbulence, by the line-correlations RL (r, t) and\nRN (r, t). At long times, these correlations are propore L (r) and e\u2212t\u03bbt G\ne N (r), respectively, where\ntional to e\u2212\u03bbt G\ne\ne\nGL (r) and GN (r) are longitudinal and transverse components of the (left/adjoint) dynamo eigenfunction. The\ncentral results of this paper are these two functions, plotted in Fig. 10, which quantify the relative contribution\nto magnetic energy from lines initially separated by the\ndistance r, in resistive units.\nThe principal contribution to the dynamo growth\ncomes from lines at separations of the order of magnitude of the resistive length `\u03b7 . However, the decay of the\ncorrelations, in units of the resistive length, is a slow,\nstretched exponential. This implies that lines which ar-\n\n\f16\nrive from any arbitrary, fixed separation r-no matter\nhow large-will contribute an amount of energy growing\nexponentially rapidly in time. Of course lines separated\nby r much, much greater than `\u03b7 will make a small relative contribution, but even lines separated by many `\u03b7\nmake a substantial contribution. To underline this fact,\ne L (r) and\nwe plot in Fig. 13 below the eigenfunctions G\n2\ne\nGN (r) multiplied by r , which, integrated over r, give\nthe mean magnetic energy for a uniform seed field. (In\norder to make this plot, we have extended our numerical results to r > 163`\u03b7 with the asymptotic formulas\n(64).) As this figure should make clear, lines separated\nby many hundreds of resistive lengths are important to\nthe dynamo growth. To be more quantitative, we find\nthat lines initially separated by up to 968`\u03b7 must be considered in order to get 90% of the total magnetic energy.\nAnother feature dramatically illustrated in Fig. 13 is the\nstrong anti-dynamo effect arising from lines-vectors initially parallel to the separation vector r, represented by\ne L (r). We have proposed a\nthe long negative tail in r2 G\nheuristic explanation for this interesting effect in terms\nof twisting and looping of field lines (Figs. 11 and 12).\n250\nlongitudinal\ntransverse\n\n!

Contributions of line-correlations to the energy. The\nintegrands, r2 GL (r) in blue and r2 GN (r) in green, for magnetic energy with a uniform seed field in eqs.(11),(12).\n\nAs we shall see in a following paper [45] these principle\nconclusions apply not only in the Kazantsev-Kraichnan\nmodel with P rm = 0 but also to kinematic dynamo in\nreal hydrodynamic turbulence with P rm \u223c 1.\nA second purpose of this paper was to discuss the\nmeaningful distinction, if any, between \"fluctuation dynamo\" and \"magnetic induction.\" In the case of the KK\nmodel at P rm = 0 and Rem = \u221e, we have shown that\na uniform mean field (or a uniform random field) may\nprovide the seed field for small-scale fluctuation dynamo.\nThe asymptotic exponential growth rate and the smallscale magnetic correlations are exactly the same as for\nany other random seed field whose correlation function is\n\nnon-orthogonal to the leading dynamo mode. We therefore do not agree with authors [33\u201335] who distinguish\nbetween \"fluctuation dynamo\" and \"magnetic induction\"\nas two fundamentally different mechanisms.\nFor example, Sch\u00fcssler and V\u00f6gler [35] have proposed\nto explain small-scale magnetic fields in the quiet solar\nphotosphere as a consequence of near-surface dynamo action. They mention magnetic induction as a possible alternative explanation, but dismiss it with the remark:\n\" 'Shredding' of pre-existing magnetic flux (remnants\nof bipolar magnetic regions) cannot explain the large\namount of observed horizontal flux since the turbulent\ncascade does not lead to an accumulation of energy (and\ngeneration of a spectral maximum) at small scales. On\nthe other hand, such a behavior is typical for turbulent\ndynamo action.\" We find in the KK model that, quite\nto the contrary, induction of a mean field produces the\nsame small-scale fluctuations and energy spectra as does\nthe fluctuation dynamo. We may indeed say that-at\nleast in the kinematic regime of weak fields- \"magnetic\ninduction\" is nothing but \"fluctuation dynamo\" with a\nlarge-scale, deterministic (mean) seed field.\nAlthough Schekochihin et al. [33] do make a distinction\nbetween two separate mechanisms, their final conclusion\nis not so different from ours. In their Fig. 8(a) they find,\n(c)\nin a sub-threshold regime with Rem < Rem , that saturated energy spectra for induction from a uniform field\nand for decaying spectra of the \"failed\" dynamo state exactly coincide, when normalized to the same total energy.\nThey conclude that \"the same mechanism is responsible\nfor setting the shape of the spectrum of the magnetic\nfluctuations induced by a mean field and of the decaying\nor growing such fluctuations in the absence of a mean\nfield,\" just as we see in the KK model.\nWe have also studied the KK model with velocity\nroughness exponent \u03be < 1, where the P rm = 0 fluctuation dynamo does not exist, and with a uniform magnetic\nseed field in order to get some insight into the physics of\nthe induction mechanism in a failed-dyamo regime. This\nis very roughly the same situation that was studied in several liquid-sodium experiments with P rm . 10\u22125 [27\u201331]\nand in related numerical simulations [32, 33] at somewhat\nlarger Prandtl numbers. Some of those studies have reported observing a k \u22125/3 spectrum of magnetic fluctuations in the velocity inertial-range [29, 31, 32], while others have reported a k \u22121 spectrum [28, 33]. The very least\nwe can conclude from our analysis is that the explanations offered for those spectra based on inertial-range turbulence physics do not successfully explain the results in\nthe KK model, even where those explanations should apparently apply. An exception is the Golitsyn-Moffatt argument for the spectrum at wavenumbers k > k\u03b7 , which\nsucceeds (with slight modification) in the KK model. At\nintermediate wavenumbers kL (t) < k < k\u03b7 , we find in\nthe KK model a range with input of magnetic energy by\ninduction of the mean field balanced by nonlinear stretching and cascade to the resistive scale. This is the same\nphysics invoked in the theory of Ruzma\u0131\u0306kin and Shukurov\n\n\f17\n[44], who predicted a spectrum hB02 ik \u22121 on dimensional\ngrounds. However, this prediction is only verified in the\nKK model for \u03be = 0, where nonlinear cascade can be\naccurately modelled as an eddy-diffusivity. For the KK\nmodel with 0 < \u03be < 1 this prediction is modified by a\nlarge anomalous exponent |\u03b61 | (with |\u03b61 | = 2 for \u03be = 1)\nwhich must be calculated by a non-perturbative argument. At low wavenumbers k < kL (t) in the KK model\nwe find a range with continuous growth of magnetic energy spectrum supplied by induction of the uniform field.\nUnlike the argument in [29, 31, 32], there is no balance\nwith large-scale advection, although such effects exist in\nthe model. Indeed, it is very unclear to us how large-scale\nadvection, which conserves magnetic energy, can by itself\nbalance the input from induction.\nWe shall not attempt here to explain in detail the induced spectra observed in the experiments and simulations, except to note that they must involve large-scale\nphysics outside inertial-range scales. This was, in fact,\nthe point of view of Bourgoin et al. [28] who explained\ntheir k \u22121 spectrum by global fluctuations of the flow pattern. Large-scale effects are certainly necessary to obtain\nsaturation of the energy. If the length-scale L(t) in (74)\nhad a finite limit for large times, e.g. for turbulence\nconfined to a box of size LB , then the system should\nreach a statistical steady-state, just as in the randomlyforced case [10]. Otherwise, magnetic energy would continue to grow without bound within a kinematic description. In such a steady-state, the only extended spectral\nranges would be the nonlinear range (74) and the Golitsyn range (73). The latter is well-confirmed in experiments [27, 28, 31] and simulations [32, 33]. If the k \u22121\nor k \u22125/3 spectra observed at larger scales can be understood at all in terms of inertial-range turbulence, then it\nseems that an analogue of the nonlinear range (74) is the\nmost likely explanation. If so, then the determination of\nthe precise exponent is a hard theoretical problem, for\nthere may be large anomalous scaling corrections to the\ndimensional Ruzma\u0131\u0306kin-Shukurov k \u22121 spectrum.\nThe precise spectral exponent of induced magnetic\nfluctuations in the liquid metal experiments is open to\ndebate. Over the limited scaling ranges available it is\nquite difficult to distinguish between \u22125/3 and \u22121 exponents and the empirical spectra can be fit about equally\nwell with both power-laws, or others as well. It is not\neven clear that the concept of \"scaling exponent\" is entirely well-defined without the possibility to extend the\nputative scaling ranges. Our three spectral ranges (73),\n(74),(75) can be made arbitrarily long by adjusting parameters, but, in the experiments and simulations, only\nthe Golitsyn spectral range can be lengthened by lowering P rm . The low-wavenumber spectral ranges can be\nmade longer only by increasing Rem , but, beyond a criti(c)\ncal value Rem , the dynamo effect sets in and the physical\nphenomena change.\n\nAppendix A: Boldyrev-Cattaneo-Rosner formalism\n\nWe consider in this appendix kinematical relations between the two-point correlations of magnetic fields and\nvector potentials, first for spatially homogeneous ensembles and then for both homogeneous and isotropic ensembles (but not reflection-symmetric). The results are\nclosely related to those in classical references on homogeneous turbulence, such as [46] and [47], but we employ a\nmathematical reformulation of [14] (hereafter, BCR) that\nwas developed for helical turbulence. We discuss here, in\nparticular, the consequences of gauge-invariance.\nThe two-point correlation of the magnetic field in\na homogeneous ensemble is defined as C ij (r, t) =\nhB i (r, t)B j (0, t)i. This satisfies the solenoidality conditions \u2202i C ij = \u2202j C ij = 0. The two-point correlation\nof the magnetic vector-potential is likewise Gij (r, t) =\nhAi (r, t)Aj (0, t)i. A pure gauge field Agi = \u2202i \u03bb has correg\n= \u2212\u2202i \u2202j \u039b with \u039b(r) = h\u03bb(r)\u03bb(0)i. Solenoidal\nlation Gij\ncorrelations C and pure-gauge correlations G g form mutually orthogonal subspaces in the Hilbert space with inner\nproduct\nZ\nhC, Gi = dd r C ij (r)Gij (r).\n(A1)\nThis observation will prove important in what follows.\nNotice also that the magnetic and vector-potential fields\nare related by curls, so that\nC ij = \u2212Dij,k` Gk`\nwith the non-positive, self-adjoint differential operator\nDij,k` = \u000fikp \u000fj`q \u2202p \u2202q .\nIt is furthermore useful to introduce the joint correlations\nof magnetic fields and vector-potentials\n\u03a8i k (r, t) = hB i (r, t)Ak (0, t)i, \u03a8k i (r, t) = hAk (r, t)B i (0, t)i\nwhich are related by \u03a8i k (r, t) = \u03a8k i (\u2212r, t). These are\nobtained from the vector-potential correlation by\n\u03a8i ` = Ri,k Gk`\nwith\nRi,k = \u000fipk \u2202p ,\nand likewise\n\u03a8k j = \u2212Rj,` Gk` = (Rj,` )\u2217 Gk` .\nThe symbol\n* here denotes adjoint with respect to\nR\nhf, gi = d3 r f (r)g(r). Note that Dij,k` = \u2212Ri,k (Rj,` )\u2217 .\nWe are mainly concerned with statistics both homogeneous and isotropic, but not necessarily invariant under\nspace reflections. In that case, the magnetic correlation\nbecomes\nC ij (r, t) = CL r\u0302i r\u0302j + CN (\u03b4 ij \u2212 r\u0302i r\u0302j ) + CH \u000fijk r\u0302k ,\n\n\f18\nwith coefficients depending only on r, t, and the\nsolenoidal condition becomes\n1\nCN (r, t) = CL (r, r) + rCL0 (r, t).\n2\n\nwith the same coefficient scalar functions as \u03a8i ` . Note\nalso that CH = \u22122\u03a80L \u2212 12 r\u03a800L by employing the\nsolenoidality relation between \u03a8N and \u03a8L .\nThe main idea of BCR was to employ a slightly different basis,\n\nNote that there is no condition on CH , as the third term\nis always divergence-free. One can similarly write the\nvector-potential correlation as\nGij (r, t) = GL r\u0302i r\u0302j + GN (\u03b4ij \u2212 r\u0302i r\u0302j ) + GH \u000fijk r\u0302k .\nFor a pure-gauge field\nGgL (r, t) = \u039b00 (r, t), GgN (r, t) =\n\n1 0\n\u039b (r, t), GgH (r, t) \u2261 0.\nr\n\nThis is equivalent to the conditions\nGL (r, t) = GN (r, t) + rG0N (r, t), GH (r, t) \u2261 0.\nWe consider also the mixed magnetic and vector potential correlators:\n\u03a8i j (r, t) = \u03a8L r\u0302i r\u0302j + \u03a8N (\u03b4 i j \u2212 r\u0302i r\u0302j ) + \u03a8H \u000fi jk r\u0302k ,\nThis correlation must be divergence-free in both indices i\nand j. This is trivial for i and follows in j for the first two\nterms by their symmetry in i, j. The third antisymmetric term is always solenoidal in both indices. Another\ninteresting fact is that this mixed correlation is gaugeinvariant in the isotropic sector. To see this, note that\nhB i (r, t)\u039b(0, t)i = P (r, t)r\u0302i\n\nC ij (r, t) = C1\n\nand likewise for Gij , with normalizations chosen so that\nthe Hilbert space inner product in the isotropic sector\nbecomes\nZ \u221e\nhC, Gi = 4\u03c0\ndr [C1 G1 + C2 G2 + C3 G3 ].\n0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\nTrivially C1 = 2rCN , C2 = rCL , C3 = 2rCH . The\nmain advantage of this normalization is the simplification of various differential operators. A straightforward\ncalculation (see details below) gives C = \u2212DG with\n\uf8eb\n\nD=\uf8ed\n\nwhich implies gauge-invariance of \u03a8i k . The same argument implies also that every vector-potential correlation\nin the isotropic sector can be written as a sum G = G s +G g\nof a solenoidal correlation G s and pure-gauge correlation\nG g . This follows by writing the vector-potential field as\nA = As + \u2207\u039b, where As is the Coloumb-gauge potential\nsatisfying \u2207*As = 0, and G s is thereby identified as the\ncorrelator of the Coloumb-gauge vector potential field.\nThe relation \u03a8i ` = Ri,k Gk` becomes in the isotropic\nsector\n\u03a8L = 2\n\nGH\nGH\nGL \u2212 GN\n, \u03a8N =\n+ G0H , \u03a8H =\n\u2212 G0N .\nr\nr\nr\n\nThe solenoidality condition \u03a8N = \u03a8L + 21 r\u03a80L is satisfied automatically, consistent with our earlier conclusion.\nThe relation C ij = Ri,k \u03a8k j likewise becomes\nCL = 2\n\n\u03a8H\n\u03a8H\n\u03a8L \u2212 \u03a8N\n, CN =\n+ \u03a80H , CH =\n\u2212 \u03a80N\nr\nr\nr\n\nby using\n\u03a8k j (r, t) = \u03a8L r\u0302k r\u0302j + \u03a8N (\u03b4kj \u2212 r\u0302k r\u0302j ) + \u03a8H \u000fkj` r\u0302` ,\n\n\u22022\n\u221a r\n2\nr \u2202r\n0\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\u2202r r2\n\u2212 r22\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f8\n0\n1\n1\n4\nr 2 \u2202r r \u2202r r 2\n\nacting on the 3-vector function G = (G1 , G2 , G3 )> . The\noperator D is explicitly self-adjoint in this representation.\nSimilar simplifications occur in the operators R and R\u2217 .\nFollowing BCR we introduce\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0\nW = \uf8ed W2 \uf8f8 ,\nW3\n\nby isotropy. The solenoidal condition implies that\nP (r, t) = \u03b1(t)/r2 and regularity for r \u2192 0 implies that\n\u03b1(t) \u2261 0. By differentiation it then follows that also\nhB i (r, t)\u2202k \u039b(0, t)i = 0,\n\n\u03b4 ij \u2212 r\u0302i r\u0302j\nr\u0302i r\u0302j\n\u000fijk r\u0302k\n\u221a\n+ C2\n+ C3 \u221a ,\nr\n2r\n2r\n\nwith\nW2 = \u03a83 =\n\n\u221a\n\n2r\u03a8H ,\n\nW3 = \u03a81 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n1\n2\u03a82 = \u221a r2 \u03a80L .\n2\n\nThis representation exploits the fact that \u03a8 has implicitly only two degrees of freedom, due to the solenoidality\ncondition on \u03a8L and \u03a8N . A bit of calculation yields\nC = RW, W = R\u2217 G\nwith\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n0 \u221a\n\u2202r\n0\n\uf8f8,\nR = \uf8ed 0 r2\n0\n1\n2\n0 0 \u2212 r2 \u2202r r\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\u2217\n\uf8ed\nR = \u2212\u2202r\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n2\n\uf8f8,\n0\nr\n1\n2\n0 r \u2202r r2\n\n0\n\n\u221a\n\nThe range of the operator R is easily checked to consist\nof the solenoidal correlations, while its adjoint R\u2217 annihilates pure-gauge fields, associated to gauge-invariance\nof W. Combining the above results gives the previous\nformula for D = \u2212RR\u2217 . We see that D is a negativedefinite, self-adjoint operator in the isotropic sector.\n\n\f19\nAppendix B: Numerical Methods\n\nThis appendix discusses the numerical solution of the\nequation (55) in the text:\n\u2202r (r2 b\u2202r \u039b) + \u03bbr2 \u039b = \u2212r2 F.\nThe output of MATSLISE provides an input to this equation, via the source term F = 2\u03a6 + T G. We shall therefore employ the same grid of points ri , i = 1, ..., L that\nwas generated by the MATSLISE algorithm for solving the\nSturm-Liouville problem (44). It is useful to observe that\nthat grid is approximately evenly spaced on a logarithmic\nscale. Thus, we introduce into (55) the variable \u03c3 = ln r\nand multiply by r, giving\n\u2202\u03c3 (p(\u03c3)\u2202\u03c3 \u039b) + q(\u03c3)\u039b = \u2212f (\u03c3)\n\n(B1)\n\nwith definitions (different than in (44))\np = e\u03c3 b(e\u03c3 ), q = \u03bbe3\u03c3 , f = e3\u03c3 F (e\u03c3 ).\nWe then discretize (B1) as\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u039bi+1 \u2212 \u039bi\n\u039bi \u2212 \u039bi\u22121\n1\np(\u03c3i )\n\u2212 p(\u03c3i\u22121 )\n\u03b4\u03c3i\n\u03b4\u03c3i\n\u03b4\u03c3i\u22121\n+q(\u03c3i )\u039bi = \u2212f (\u03c3i )\nwith \u03b4\u03c3i = \u03c3i+1 \u2212 \u03c3i and \u03c3i = ln ri , i = 1, 2, ..., L . An\nextra point is added with \u03c3L+1 = \u221e and \u039bL+1 = 0 to\ndefine the components with i or j = L. This leads to the\nL-vector equation\nM\u039b = F\n\n(B2)\n\nwith negative-definite, self-adjoint, tridiagonal matrix\nMij =\n\np(\u03c3i )\np(\u03c3i\u22121 )\n\u03b4j,i+1 +\n\u03b4j,i\u22121 +\n\u03b4\u03c3\n\u03b4\u03c3i\u22121\n\u0012i\n\u0013\np(\u03c3i ) p(\u03c3i\u22121 )\nq(\u03c3i )\u03b4\u03c3i \u2212\n\u2212\n\u03b4ij\n\u03b4\u03c3i\n\u03b4\u03c3i\u22121\n\nand vector Fi = \u2212f (\u03c3i )\u03b4\u03c3i . The i = L equation is\n\nRr\nintegral 0 d\u03c1 a(\u03c1)W2 (\u03c1)/\u03c1 using the composite trapezoidal rule (cumtrapz in MATLAB). The first (L \u2212 1) linear\nequations from (B2) are then solved using mldivide in\nMATLAB, giving \u039bi , i = 1, 2, ...,\u221aL \u2212 1.\nGetting corrections \u03b4G1 = 2\u039b0 (r), \u03b4G2 (r) = r\u039b00 (r)\nrequires us to approximate also derivatives of \u039b(r). We\nemploy the formula \u039b0 (r) = 1r \u2202\u03c3 \u039b discretized using central differences as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c3i+1 + \u03c3i\u22121 \u039bi+1 \u2212 \u039bi\u22121\n\u039b0i = exp \u2212\n.\n2\n\u03c3i+1 \u2212 \u03c3i\u22121\nAt the endpoints i = 1, L corresponding forward and\nbackward-difference approximations are employed. To\ncalculate the second-derivative \u039b00i , the same formulas are\nemployed with \u039bi replaced by \u039b0i . The difference approximations yields some spurious oscillations for r . 2, which\nare removed by filtering.\nThe parameters \u039b0 , \u039b1 , and \u039bs in the small-r asymptotics (56),(57) for \u039b(r) were determined as follows. We\nfound directly that \u039b0 = \u22121535.5 by taking the limit of\nsmall r in the numerical solution. We then calculated\n\u039b1 in two different ways. First, we solved eq.(58), or\n\u03bb\u039b0 + 12\u039b1 = \u2212F\n\u221a0 . To get a sufficiently accurate value\nof F0 = 2\u03a60 + 24 2A/\u03bb we had to calculate an accurate\nvalue of the integral\nZ \u221e\naW2 .\n\u03a60 = \u2212\ndr\n= \u2212208.1745\nr\n0\nTo get this value, we extended the numerical solution for\nW2 from MATSLISE using the large-r asymptotic formula\n(47) from r = 560 to r = 104 , and then used a composite trapezoid rule to approximate the integral. This gave\n.\nF0 = 439.043 and a resulting value \u039b1 = 11.9299. On\nthe other hand, we could also determine \u039b1 by a leastsquare linear fit to \u039b(r) \u2212 \u039b0 in a log-log plot. Over the\nrange from r = 2.7 \u00d7 10\u22126 to r = 0.12 the best fit was\n.\n\u039b(r) \u2212 \u039b0 = \u039b1 rm with m = 1.9999 and \u039b1 = 11.9517,\nagreeing quite well with the previous, independent determination. Finally, we calculated \u039bs = \u22126.0232 from the\nalready determined numerical constants and eq.(59). It\nwas verified that the full small-r asymptotic expression\n\u039b = \u039breg + \u039bsing with these constants gave an accurate\nfit to the numerical result for r < 0.5.\n\nq(\u03c3L )\u039bL = f (\u03c3L )\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nwith direct solution \u039bL = F (\u03c3L )/\u03bb. The remaining L \u2212 1\nequations can be solved with the above value as boundary condition on \u039bL or, more simply, with the boundary\ncondition \u039bL = 0 (since F (\u03c3) \u2192 0 as \u03c3 \u2192 \u221e). We have\nverified that both choices of boundary conditions lead to\nvery quantitatively similar results; we thus present only\nthose with the condition \u039bL = 0.
