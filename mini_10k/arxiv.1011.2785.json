The description of the dynamics of systems subject to noisy environments [1], as well\nthe detection, quantification and estimation of losses and,\nmore generally, the characterization of lossy channels at\nthe quantum level, received much attention in the recent\nyears [1\u20134]. An efficient characterization of decoherence\nis relevant for quantum repeaters [5], quantum memories\n[6], cavity QED systems [7], superconducting quantum\ncircuits [8], quantum teleportation [9], quantum cryptography [10, 11] and secret-key capacities [12, 13].\nIn this paper we address the discrimination of lossy\nchannels, i.e., we consider a situation where the loss\n(damping) rate of a channel may assume only two possible values and we want to discriminate between them\nby probing the channel with a given class of states. In\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: Carmen.Invernizzi@unimi.it\naddress: matteo.paris@fisica.unimi.it\n\u2021 Electronic address: pirs@cs.york.ac.uk\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nparticular, we address the discrimination of lossy channels for bosonic systems using squeezed thermal states\nas probing states, and focus attention to the case when\none of the values for the loss parameter is zero, i.e., we\naddress the detection of a possible loss against the alternative hypothesis of an ideal lossless channel. Such\nkind of discrimination is crucial since a recent analysis\n[14] has revealed the importance of assessing the deviation from ideal conditions, i.e., the identity channel, in\nimplementing large-scale quantum communication.\nDespite the discrimination of lossy channels has been\nalready considered in the literature, the approach of this\npaper is novel. Previous works have in fact considered\nthis kind of discrimination by constraining the energy irradiated over the unknown lossy channel but not the total\nenergy employed in preparing the input states. For instance, in the quantum reading of digital memories [15],\nthe discrimination of lossy channels has been analyzed\nby fixing the mean total number of photons irradiated\nover the channel, independently on the number of probing modes (this approach has been also followed by the\nrecent Ref. [16]). Previously, in the quantum illumination of targets [17, 18], the channel discrimination was\nperformed by fixing the mean number of photons in each\nof the modes probing the channel. In both these models\nthere was no restriction for the energy involved in the\n\n\f2\nuse of ancillary modes. Our approach considers the discrimination of lossy channels by constraining the total\nenergy of the input state, thus including both the probing mode (irradiated over the unknown lossy channel)\nand a possible ancillary mode (bypassing the lossy channel and detected by the output measurement). Thus,\nwhile previous models were more focussed on restricting\nthe energy irradiated over the channel, we address the\nproblem from the point of view of the input source, i.e.,\nconsidering the global effort in preparing this source. By\nfixing the input energy, we then optimize over an important class of Gaussian states, i.e., single- and two-mode\nsqueezed thermal states. The choice of these states relies in their experimental accessibility, being routinely\ngenerated in today's quantum optics laboratories where\nthey can be reliably controlled [19]. Furthermore, because of the squeezing, they represent important examples of non-classical states, i.e., states with non-positive\nP representation [20]. This is another feature which diversifies our study from previous works [15, 17], where\nthe main goal was the comparison between non-classical\nstates and classical states (i.e., with positive P representation). Note also that our problem, involving a discrete\nchannel discrimination, is completely different from problems of parameter estimation, where one has to infer a\nparameter taking continuous values. The estimation of\nthe damping constant of a bosonic channel has been recently addressed by Refs. [21\u201324].\nIt is clear that, for a given input state, any problem of\nchannel discrimination collapses into a problem of state\ndiscrimination [25\u201329], where we have to compute the\nminimum error probability in identifying one of two possible output states. By assuming M identical copies of\nthe input state and a memoryless quantum channel, we\nhave M output states which are exact replicas of two\nequiprobable states. In this case, the minimum error\nprobability is well-approximated by the quantum Chernoff bound (QCB) [30\u201334]. Now the crucial step is to\nvary the input state, trying to optimize the value of the\noutput QCB. In the case of two lossy bosonic channels,\nthis kind of optimization must be constrained, meaning\nthat we have to fix some crucial parameters of the input states, in particular, their energy. As we have already mentioned before, in our investigation we optimize\nthe QCB on the class of single- and two-mode squeezed\nthermal states by fixing their total energy. Single-mode\nthermal states are sent through the lossy channel, while\ntwo-mode thermal states probe the channel with the one\nof the modes (probing mode) while bypassing the channel and assisting the output measurement with the other\nmode (reference mode). In this scenario, we find that\nthe pure version of these states, i.e., single- and twomode squeezed vacuum states, are optimal for detecting\nlosses, i.e., discriminating a lossy from a lossless channel.\nFurthermore, we are able to show that, for any value of\nthe damping rate smaller than a certain critical value,\nthere is a threshold on the energy that makes the twomode squeezed vacuum state more convenient than the\n\ncorresponding single-mode state. More interestingly, for\ndamping rates larger than the critical value, the twomode squeezed vacuum state performs always better than\nthe single-mode squeezed vacuum state with exactly the\nsame energy.\nIn order to stay close to schemes which are feasible\nwith current technology, we also analyze the effect of the\nmixedness in the probe states. In this case, we study the\nchannel discrimination by fixing not only the total energy\nof the input state but also its total amount of squeezing. Then, we are able to show that two-mode squeezed\nthermal states are always better than their single-mode\ncounterpart when all the thermal photons are directed\ninto the dissipative channel. We have numerically verified\nthat this result also holds, approximately, for unbalanced\ndistribution of the thermal photons. Finally, we also investigate the role of correlations in the improvement of\nloss detection. In order to quantify correlations, besides\nentanglement and mutual information, we exploit the recent results on the quantum discord [35\u201340], which has\nbeen defined with the aim of capturing quantum correlations in mixed separable states that are not quantified by\nentanglement. Thus, at fixed input squeezing, we study\nthe reduction of the QCB as a function of various correlation quantifiers, i.e., quantum mutual information, entanglement and quantum discord. This analysis allows us\nto conclude that employing squeezing in the form of correlations, either quantum or classical, is beneficial for the\ntask of loss detection whenever squeezed thermal states\nare considered as input probes.\nThe paper is structured as follows. In Sec. II we review the discrimination of quantum states together with\nthe general definition of the QCB. In Sec. III we give the\nbasic notation for Gaussian states and in Sec. IV we review the formula of the QCB for Gaussian states. Then,\nin Sec. V we discuss the discrimination of lossy channels\nby considering single-mode and two-mode squeezed thermal states. In particular, we provide the details on how\nto compute the QCB for distinguishing an ideal lossless\nchannel from a lossy channel. Section VI reports the\nmain results regarding the single- and two-mode states\nas a function of the total energy and squeezing. Finally,\nin Section VII we analyze the role of correlations in enhancing the discrimination. Section VIII closes the paper\nwith some concluding remarks.\n\nII.\n\nQUANTUM STATE DISCRIMINATION AND\nQUANTUM CHERNOFF BOUND\n\nAs we have mentioned before, the problem of quantum\nchannel discrimination collapses to the problem of quantum state discrimination when we fix the input state. As\na result, mathematical tools such as the quantum fidelity\nand the QCB are fundamental in our analysis. Despite\nit has been introduced only very recently, the QCB has\nbeen already a crucial tool in several areas of quantum\ninformation: it has been exploited as a distinguishabil-\n\n\f3\nity measure between qubits and single-mode Gaussian\nstates [30, 31], to evaluate the degree of nonclassicality\nfor single-mode Gaussian states [41] or the polarization\nof a two-mode state [42]. It has also been applied in the\ntheory of quantum phase transitions to distinguish between different phases of the XY model at finite temperature [43], and to the discrimination of two ground states\nor two thermal states in the quantum Ising model [44].\nFor continuous variables systems the quantum discrimination of Gaussian states is a central point in view of\ntheir experimental accessibility and their relatively simple mathematical description [45, 46]. In fact, in the case\nof Gaussian states, the QCB can be computed from their\nfirst and the second statistical moments. A first formula,\nvalid for single-mode Gaussian states, was derived in [30].\nLater, Ref. [34] provided a general closed formula for multimode Gaussian states, relating the QCB bound to their\nsymplectic spectra. Furthermore, from these spectra one\ncan derive larger upper bounds which are easier to compute than the QCB [34].\nIn this section, we start by establishing notation and\nreviewing the problem of quantum state discrimination,\ntogether with the general definition of QCB. Then, from\nthe next section, we will specialize our attention to the\ncase of Gaussian states and we will review the formula\nfor Gaussian states in Sec. IV.\nIn its simplest formulation, the problem of quantum\nstate discrimination consists in distinguishing between\ntwo possible states, \u03c1A and \u03c1B , which are equiprobable\nfor a quantum system. We suppose that M identical\ncopies of the quantum system are available. Then, we\nhave the following equiprobable hypotheses, HA and HB ,\nabout the global state\nHA : \u03c1 M\nA = \u03c1A \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1A\n|\n{z\n}\nM\n\nHB : \u03c1 M\nB = \u03c1B \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03c1B .\n|\n{z\n}\n\nis known as the Helstrom matrix [25]. Now, the error probability Pe has to be minimized over EB . Since\nTr[\u039b] = 0, the Helstrom matrix has both positive and\nnegative eigenvalues and the minimum Pe is attained if\nEB is chosen as the projector over \u039b+ , i.e., the positive\nsubspace of \u039b. Assuming this optimal operator\nwe have\n\u221a\nTr[EB \u039b] = Tr[\u039b+ ] = 21 Tr |\u039b| with |\u039b| = \u039b\u2020 \u039b. Thus\nthe minimal error probability is given by\nPe =\nwhere\n\n\u0003\n1\u0002\nM\n1 \u2212 T (\u03c1M\nA , \u03c1B ) ,\n2\n\nT (\u03c1, \u03c3) =\n\n1\nTr |\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c3|\n2\n\nis the so-called trace distance. The computation of the\ntrace distance may be rather difficult. For this reason,\none can resort to the QCB that gives an upper bound to\nthe probability of error Pe [30\u201334]\nPe \u2264\n\nQM\n,\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u0002\n\u0003\nQ = inf Tr \u03c1sA \u03c11\u2212s\n.\nB\n\n(3)\n\n0\u2264s\u22641\n\nThe bound of Eq. (2) is attainable asymptotically in the\nlimit M \u2192 \u221e as follows from the results in [31, 32]. One\nmay think that the trace distance has a more natural\noperational meaning than the QCB. In spite of this, it\ndoes not adapt to the case of many copies; indeed, one\ncan find states \u03c1, \u03c3, \u03c1\u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 such that\nT (\u03c1, \u03c3) < T (\u03c1\u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 ) but T (\u03c1\u2032M , \u03c3 \u2032M ) < T (\u03c1M , \u03c3 M ) .\nBy contrast, the QCB does resolve this problem since\n\nM\n\nIn order to discriminate between these two hypotheses, one can measure the global system by using a\ntwo-outcome positive operator valued measure (POVM)\n{EA , EB }, with EA + EB = I and EA , EB \u2265 0. After observing the outcome j = A or B, the observer infers that\nthe state of the system was \u03c1M\nj . The error probability\nof inferring the state \u03c1M\nwhen\nthe actual state is \u03c1M\nj\nk is\n\u0003\n\u0002\n.\nAs\na\nrethus given by the Born rule Pjk = Tr \u03c1M\nE\nj\nk\nsult, the optimal POVM for this discrimination problem\nis the one minimizing the overall probability of misidentification, i.e., Pe = 12 (PBA + PAB ). Since EA = I \u2212 EB ,\nwe have\n1\n1\nM\nPe = Tr[\u03c1M\nA EB ] + Tr[\u03c1B EA ]\n2\n2\n1\n= (1 \u2212 Tr [EB \u039b]) ,\n(1)\n2\nwhere\nM\n\u039b = \u03c1M\nB \u2212 \u03c1A ,\n\nQ(\u03c1, \u03c3) < Q(\u03c1\u2032 , \u03c3 \u2032 ) =\u21d2 Q(\u03c1M , \u03c3 M ) < Q(\u03c1\u2032M , \u03c3 \u2032M ) .\nBecause of this property, the minimization of the QCB\nover single-copy states (\u03c1 and \u03c3) implies the minimization\nover multi-copy states (\u03c1M and \u03c3 M ). This is true as long\nas the minimization is unconstrained or if the constraints\nregard single-copy observables (e.g., the mean energy per\ncopy).\nFinally, note that there is a close relation between the\nQCB and the Uhlmann fidelity\nF (\u03c1A , \u03c1B ) = Tr\n\n\u0012q\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03c1A \u03c1B \u03c1A\n\n\u00132\n\nwhich is one of the most popular measures of distinguishability for quantum states. In fact, for the singlecopy state discrimination (M = 1) we have [30, 34, 47, 48]\np\np\nF (\u03c1A , \u03c1B )\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 F (\u03c1A , \u03c1B )\nQ\n\u2264 Pe \u2264\n\u2264\n. (4)\n2\n2\n2\n\n\f4\nMore generally, by exploiting the multiplicativity of the\nfidelity under tensor products of density operators, i.e.,\nF (\u03c1A \u2297 \u03c3A , \u03c1B \u2297 \u03c3B ) = F (\u03c1A , \u03c1B )F (\u03c3A , \u03c3B ) ,\nwe can write\nM\nM\nF (\u03c1M\n= FM .\nA , \u03c1B ) = F (\u03c1A , \u03c1B )\n\nThis leads to the general multi-copy version of Eq.

However, if one of the two states is pure, then the QCB just\nequals the fidelity, i.e., we have\nQ(\u03c1A , \u03c1B ) = F (\u03c1A , \u03c1B ) = Tr[\u03c1A \u03c1B ] .\nIII.\n\nGAUSSIAN STATES\n\nwhere \u039b is the real vector\n\u039b = (Re\u03bb1 , Im\u03bb1 , . . . , Re\u03bbn , Im\u03bbn )T .\nIn this case, the state is described by its first two statistical moments, i.e., the vector of mean values X and the\ncovariance matrix (CM) \u03c3, whose elements are defined\nas\nXl =hRl i\n1\n\u03c3lm = h{Rl , Rm }i \u2212 hRl ihRm i\n2\n\n(8)\n\nwhere {A, B} = AB + BA denotes the anti-commutator,\nand hOi = Tr[\u03c1O] is the mean value of the operator O.\nIn the remainder of this section, we consider only zeromean Gaussian states, i.e., Gaussian states with X = 0,\nwhich are therefore fully specified by their CM. The properties of these states may be expressed in very simple\nterms by introducing the symplectic transformations. A\nmatrix S is called symplectic when preserves the symplectic form of Eq. (6), i.e.,\nS\u03a9S T = \u03a9.\n\nIn this section we give the basic notions on bosonic\nsystems and Gaussian states, ending with the definition\nof squeezed thermal states.\nAn n-mode bosonic system is described by a tensorproduct Hilbert space H\u2297n and a vector of canonical\noperators R = (q1 , p1 , . . . , qn , pn )T satisfying the commutation relations\n[Rl , Rm ] = i\u03a9lm ,\n\nThen, according to the Williamson's theorem, for every\nCM \u03c3, there exists a symplectic matrix S such that\n\u03c3 = SW S T\nwhere\nW =\n\nn\nM\n\ndk\n\nk=1\n\nwhere l, m = 1, * * * , 2n and \u03a9lm are the elements of the\nsymplectic form\n\u0013\nn \u0012\nM\n0 1\n.\n(6)\n\u03a9=\n\u22121 0\nk=1\n\nAlternatively, we can use the mode operators ak which\nare given by the cartesian decomposition of the canonical\noperators, i.e.,\n1\n1\nqk = \u221a (ak + a\u2020k ) , pk = \u221a (ak \u2212 a\u2020k ) .\n2\ni 2\nThese operators satisfy the commutation relations\n[ak , a\u2020k\u2032 ] = \u03b4kk\u2032 with k, k \u2032 = 1, * * * , n.\nAn arbitrary quantum state \u03c1 of the system is equivalently described by the characteristic function\n\u03c7[\u03c1](\u03bb) = Tr[\u03c1D(\u03bb)]\nwhere D(\u03bb) = \u2297nk=1 Dk (\u03bbk ) is the n-mode displacement operator, with \u03bb = (\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbn )T , \u03bbk \u2208 C, and\nDk (\u03bbk ) = exp{\u03bbk a\u2020k \u2212 \u03bb\u2217k ak } is the single mode displacement operator. A state \u03c1 is called Gaussian if the corresponding characteristic function is Gaussian\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1 T\nT\n\u03c7[\u03c1](\u039b) = exp \u2212 \u039b \u03c3\u039b + X \u03a9\u039b\n(7)\n2\n\n(9)\n\n\u0012\n\n1 0\n0 1\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\nand the dk 's are called the symplectic eigenvalues of \u03c3.\nThe physical statement implied by the decomposition of\nEq. (9) is that every zero-mean Gaussian state \u03c1 can be\nobtained from a thermal state by performing the unitary\ntransformation US associated with the symplectic matrix\nS, i.e., we have\n\u03c1 = US \u03bd US\u2020\nwhere \u03bd = \u03bd1 \u2297. . .\u2297\u03bdn is a tensor product of single-mode\nthermal states\n\u0012\n\u0013m\n1 X\nn\u0304k\n\u03bdk =\n|mik hm|\nn\u0304k + 1 m n\u0304k + 1\nwith average number of photons given by n\u0304k = dk \u2212 1/2.\nFor a single-mode system the most general zero-mean\nGaussian state may be written as\n\u03c1 = S(\u03b6)\u03bdS \u2020 (\u03b6)\n2\n\nwhere S(\u03b6) = exp{ 12 (\u03b6a\u2020 \u2212 \u03b6 \u2217 a2 )} is the single-mode\nsqueezing operator and \u03b6 = rei\u03c6 \u2208 C. The corresponding\ncovariance matrix is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\na c\n(10)\n\u03c3=\nc b\n\n\f5\nwhere\n1\na = (n\u0304 + ) [cosh(2r) \u2212 sinh(2r) cos \u03c6]\n2\n1\nb = (n\u0304 + ) [cosh(2r) + sinh(2r) cos \u03c6]\n2\n1\n(11)\nc = (n\u0304 + ) sinh(2r) sin \u03c6 .\n2\nIn particular, we can consider the case of a real squeezing\nparameter, e.g., by fixing \u03b6 = \u2212r [50]. In this case, the\nprevious expressions of Eq. (11) simplify into the following\n1\na = (2n\u0304 + 1) exp(2r)\n2\n1\nb = (2n\u0304 + 1) exp(\u22122r)\n2\nc=0.\n\n(12)\n\nThis state defines the single-mode squeezed thermal\nstate. It depends on two real parameters only, i.e., we\nhave\n\u03c1 = S(r)\u03bdS \u2020 (r) = \u03c1(r, n\u0304) .\nIn particular, for n\u0304 = 0 the state is pure and corresponds to a single-mode squeezed vacuum state \u03c1(r, 0) =\nS(r) |0i h0| S \u2020 (r).\nNow let us consider two-mode (zero-mean) Gaussian\nstates. They are completely characterized by their 4 \u00d7 4\nCM\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA C\n\u03c3=\n(13)\nCT B\n\nwith I2 the 2 \u00d7 2 identity matrix and \u03c3z = diag(1, \u22121)\nthe z-Pauli matrix. This corresponds to considering a\ndensity operator of the form\n\u03c1 = S2 (r) (\u03bd1 \u2297 \u03bd2 ) S2 (r)\u2020 ,\n\nwhere S2 (r) = exp{r(a\u2020 b\u2020 \u2212 ab)} is the two-mode squeezing operator. This state depends on three real parameters: the squeezing parameter and the two thermal numbers, i.e., we have\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(r, n\u03041 , n\u03042 ) .\nIn particular, for n\u03041 = n\u03042 = 0 the state is pure and corresponds to a two-mode squeezed vacuum state \u03c1(r, 0, 0) =\nS2 (r)(|0i1 h0| \u2297 |0i2 h0|)S2\u2020 (r).\nIV.\n\nQUANTUM CHERNOFF BOUND FOR\nGAUSSIAN STATES\n\nHere we review the formula of the QCB for multimode\nGaussian states [34]. In particular, we adapt this formula\nto our notation and physical units (here the vacuum noise\nis 1/2, while in Ref. [34] it was equal to 1). Let us consider\ntwo Gaussian states \u03c1 (with statistical moments X and\n\u03c3) and \u03c1\u2032 (with statistical moments X \u2032 and \u03c3 \u2032 ). The\nCMs of these two states can be decomposed as\n\u03c3 = S W (n\u03041 , * * * , n\u0304n ) S T\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\nwhere {n\u0304k } and\n\n{n\u0304\u2032k }\n\n\u03c3 =S\n\nW (n\u0304\u20321 , * * *\n\nS\n\n\u2032T\n\n(17)\n,\n\n(18)\n\nare their thermal numbers, and\n\nW (x1 , * * * , xn ) =\n\nwhere A, B and C are 2 \u00d7 2 blocks. It is useful to introduce the symplectic invariants\n\n, n\u0304\u2032n )\n\nn\nM\n(2xk + 1)I2 .\nk=1\n\nNow let us define the functions\n\nI1 = det A , I2 = det B ,\nI3 = det C , I4 = det \u03c3 .\n\n(14)\n\nBy means of these invariants, we can simply write the\ntwo symplectic eigenvalues as\ns\n\u221a\n\u2206 \u00b1 \u22062 \u2212 4I4\nd\u00b1 =\n,\n2\nwhere \u2206 = I1 + I2 + 2I3 [51, 52]. By means of local\nsymplectic operations, the CM of Eq. (13) can be recast\nin the standard form, where the three blocks A and B\nare proportional to the identity and C is diagonal [51].\nIn the particular case of a two-mode squeezed thermal\nstate, we can write\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 AI2 C\u03c3z\n\u03c3=\n(15)\n2 C\u03c3z BI2\n\nGs (x) =\n\n1\n,\n(x + 1)s \u2212 xs\n\n\u039bs (x) =\n\nxs\n.\n(x + 1)s \u2212 xs\n\nand\n\nThen, the QCB is given by\n\nQ = inf Qs ,\n0\u2264s\u22641\n\nwhere\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03a0s\n1 T \u22121\nQs = \u221a\nexp \u2212 d \u03a3s d .\n2\ndet \u03a3s\nIn the formula of Eq.

First of all, since they\nare zero-mean Gaussian states, we have d = 0 and, therefore, the exponential factor in Eq. (19) disappears. Then,\nthe symplectic decompositions in Eqs. (17) and (18) are\nachieved using symplectic matrices S and S \u2032 which are\njust one-parameter squeezing matrices, i.e., S = S(r)\nand S \u2032 = S \u2032 (r\u2032 ).\nThus, let us consider the discrimination of single-mode\nsqueezed thermal states \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, n\u0304) and \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1\u2032 (r\u2032 , n\u0304\u2032 ).\nIn this case, the QCB can be computed using\n\nwhere\n\n\u03a0s (n\u0304, n\u0304\u2032 )\nQs = p\n,\ndet \u03a3s (r, n\u0304, r\u2032 , n\u0304\u2032 )\n\n(20)\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u0393\n\n1\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u0393\n\n2\n\n\u03c1'\n\n\u03c1'\n\nFIG. 1: Single- and two-mode schemes for the detection of\nlosses.

In order to detect loss, we consider either a\nsingle-mode squeezed thermal state evolving in the lossy\nchannel with parameter \u0393 followed by a measurement at\nthe output, or a two-mode squeezed thermal state with\nthe damping process occurring in only one of the two\nmodes (the probing mode), followed by a measurement\non both of the modes. Our aim is to minimize the error\nprobability in discriminating between the ideal case \u0393 =\n0 and the lossy case \u0393 > 0. In the next section, this\nwill be done by fixing some important parameters of the\ninput state, such as total energy and squeezing [53].\nThe propagation of a mode of radiation in a lossy channel corresponds to the coupling of the mode a with a zero\ntemperature reservoir made of large number of external\nmodes. By assuming a Markovian reservoir and weak\ncoupling between the system and the reservoir the dynamics of the system is described by the Lindblad Master\nequation [54]\n\nDETECTION OF LOSSES BY THERMAL\nPROBES\n\nIn what follows, we study the evolution of a Gaussian state in a dissipative channel E\u0393 characterized by\na damping rate \u0393, which may result from the interaction of the system with an external environment, as for\nexample a bath of oscillators, or from an absorption process. We consider the problem of detecting whether or\nnot the dissipation dynamics occurred. Given an input\nstate \u03c1, this corresponds to discriminating between an\noutput state identical to the input \u03c1, and another output state storing the presence of loss E\u0393 (\u03c1). Lossy channels are Gaussian channels, meaning that they tansform\nGaussian states into Gaussian states. Furthermore, if\nthe input is a squeezed thermal state, then the output\n\n\u03c1\u0307 =\n\n\u0393\nL[a]\u03c1\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere L[a]\u03c1 = 2a\u03c1a\u2020 \u2212 a\u2020 a\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1a\u2020 a. The general solution\nmay be expressed by using the operator-sum representation of the associated completely-positive map, i.e., upon\nwriting \u03b7 = e\u2212\u0393t , we have\nX\n\u033a(\u03b7) =\nVm \u033aVm\u2020\nm\n\nwhere\nVm =\n\nr\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03b7)m m 1 (a\u2020 a\u2212m)\na \u03b72\n,\nm!\n\nand \u033a is the initial state.\n\n\f7\nA.\n\nSingle-mode case\n\nLet us now start with single-mode states. Eq. (22) can\nbe recast into a Fokker-Planck equation for the Wigner\nfunction in terms of the quadrature variables q and p,\n\u1e86 =\n\n\u0003\n\u0393\u0002 T\nT\nT\nW\n\u03c3 \u221e \u2202X\n\u2202 X + \u2202X\n2 X\n\n(r, n\u0304) \u2192 (r, nT ) and (r\u2032 , n\u0304\u2032 ) \u2192 (r\u0393 , n\u0393 )\n\nwhere X = (q, p)T , \u2202X = (\u2202q , \u2202p )T and we introduced\nthe diffusion matrix \u03c3 \u221e = diag(1/2, 1/2). Solving the\nequation for the Wigner function of a single-mode Gaussian state one can obtain the evolution equation for the\nCM \u03c3. This is given by [55]\n\u03c3\u0307 = \u2212\u0393(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3 \u221e ) ,\nwhich yields to\n\u03c3(t) = e\u2212\u0393t \u03c3 0 + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393t )\u03c3 \u221e .\nThe latter equation describes the evolution of an initial\nGaussian state with CM \u03c3 0 towards the stationary state\ngiven by the Gaussian state of the environment with CM\n\u03c3 \u221e . For simplicity, from now on we omit the index of\n\u03c3 0 , we replace \u03c3(t) \u2192 \u03c3 \u2032 , and we insert the time t into\nthe damping parameter \u0393. Thus, the evolved CM of the\nsingle mode case simply reads\n\u03c3 \u2032 = e\u2212\u0393 \u03c3 + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393 ) \u03c3 \u221e .\nNow let us consider the specific case of an input\nsqueezed thermal state \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, nT ) with squeezing r and\nthermal number nT . According to Eqs. (10) and (12), its\nCM is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\na 0\n,\n\u03c3=\n0 b\nwith\na=\n\n1\n1\n(1 + 2nT ) e2r , b = (1 + 2nT ) e\u22122r .\n2\n2\n\nNow, the discrimination between a lossless (\u0393 = 0) and a\nlossy channel (\u0393 > 0) corresponds to the discrimination\nbetween the input state \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, nT ) and the output one\n\u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1\u2032 (r\u0393 , n\u0393 ). In order to estimate the error probability affecting this discrimination, we can compute the\nquantum Chernoff bound. This is achieved by replacing\n\n(23)\n\nAt the output of the channel, the state \u03c1\u2032 has CM\n\u0012\n\u0013\na\u0393 0\n\u2032\n\u03c3 =\n,\n0 b\u0393\n\nin Eq. (20).\nB.\n\nTwo-mode case\n\nAccording to the scheme of Fig. 1, the map describing\nthe evolution of a two-mode state is E\u0393 \u2297 I, where the\nlossy channel E\u0393 acts on the probing mode while the identity channel I acts on the reference mode. At the level\nof the CM it corresponds to the following transformation\n\u0011\n\u0011 \u0010\n\u0010\n\u03c3 \u2032 = e\u2212\u0393/2 I2 \u2295 I2 \u03c3 e\u2212\u0393/2 I2 \u2295 I2\n+ (I4 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393 I2 \u2295 I2 )\u03c3 \u221e .\n\n(27)\n\nAs input state, let us consider a two-mode squeezed thermal state \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, nT1 , nT2 ). Its CM is provided in\nEq. (15) with the elements given in Eq. (16) by replacing\n(r, n\u03041 , n\u03042 ) \u2192 (r, nT1 , nT2 ). The CM of the output state\ncan be derived using the Eq. (27). This CM can be put\nin the normal form of Eq. (15) with elements given by\nEq. (16) by replacing (r, n\u03041 , n\u03042 ) \u2192 (r\u0393 , n\u03931 , n\u03932 ). Here\nthe squeezing parameter r\u0393 and the thermal numbers n\u03931\nand n\u03932 are function of the input parameters r, nT1 and\nnT2 (the explicit expression is too long to be shown here).\nThus, the output state is still a two-mode squeezed thermal state \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1\u2032 (r\u0393 , n\u03931 , n\u03932 ).\nAs before, the discrimination between a lossless (\u0393 =\n0) and a lossy channel (\u0393 > 0) corresponds to the discrimination between the input state \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, nT1 , nT2 ) and\nthe output one \u03c1\u2032 = \u03c1\u2032 (r\u0393 , n\u03931 , n\u03932 ). The error probability affecting this discrimination is estimated by the QCB\nwhich is computed by replacing (r, n\u03041 , n\u03042 ) \u2192 (r, nT1 , nT2 )\nand (r\u2032 , n\u0304\u20321 , n\u0304\u20322 ) \u2192 (r\u0393 , n\u03931 , n\u03932 ) in Eq. (21).\nVI.\n\nOPTIMIZATION OF THE THERMAL\nPROBES\n\nwhere\na\u0393 =\n\n1\n1\n(1 + 2n\u0393 ) e2r\u0393 , b\u0393 = (1 + 2n\u0393 ) e\u22122r\u0393 , (24)\n2\n2\n\nand\np\ndet[\u03c3 \u2032 ] \u2212 1/2\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u2212\u0393\ne a + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393 )/2\n1\n.\nr\u0393 = log \u2212\u0393\n4\ne b + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u0393 )/2\n\nn\u0393 =\n\n(25)\n(26)\n\nThus, we still have a squeezed thermal state \u03c1\u2032 =\n\u03c1\u2032 (r\u0393 , n\u0393 ) with squeezing r\u0393 and thermal number n\u0393 .\n\nIn this section, we optimize the discrimination of a lossless (\u0393 = 0) from a lossy channel (\u0393 > 0) by maximizing\nover thermal probes, i.e., single- and two-mode squeezed\nthermal states. For this sake, we evaluate the QCB as\na function of the most important parameters of the input state, i.e., its total energy and squeezing. In our\nfirst analysis, we show that for fixed total energy, singleand two-mode squeezed vacuum states are optimal. In\nparticular, we show the conditions where the two-mode\nstate outperforms the single-mode counterpart. Then, by\nfixing both the total energy and squeezing, we will find\n\n\f8\nthe optimal squeezed thermal state. According to Sec. II\nthe minimization of the QCB over single-copy states implies the minimization over multi-copy states (when the\nminimization is unconstrained or subject to single-copy\nconstraints). This implies that finding the optimal input state \u03c1 at fixed energy automatically assures that\n\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1 \u2297 * * * is the optimal multi-copy state at fixed energy per copy when we consider a multiple access to the\nunknown (memoryless) channel.\nIn order to perform our investigation we introduce a\nsuitable parametrization of the input energy. Given a\nsingle-mode squeezed thermal state \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, nT ), its energy (mean total number of photons) can be written as\nN1 = nT + nS + 2nS nT ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere nT accounts for the mean number of thermal photons, nS = sinh2 r quantifies the squeezing, and nS nT is\na cross term. Alternatively, we can introduce a squeezing\nfactor \u03b21 \u2208 [0, 1] such that\nn S = \u03b21 N 1\n(1 \u2212 \u03b21 )N1\nnT =\n.\n1 + 2\u03b21 N1\n\n1\n\u03b22 N 2\n2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b22 )N2\n=\u03b3\n1 + \u03b22 N 2\n(1 \u2212 \u03b22 )N2\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\n.\n1 + \u03b22 N 2\n\nnT1\nnT2\n\nOptimal input at fixed total energy\n\nIn our first investigation we fix the mean total number\nof photons of the input state. In other words we fix\nN1 = N2 = N .\n\n(35)\n\nThen we minimize the output QCB among single-mode\nand two-mode squeezed thermal states. As a first step\nwe compute the optimal quantities\nQ1 (N ) := inf Q1 (N, \u03b21 )\n\n(36)\n\nQ2 (N ) := inf Q2 (N, \u03b22 , \u03b3) .\n\n(37)\n\n\u03b21\n\n\u03b22 ,\u03b3\n\n(30)\n\nThen, we compare Q1 (N ) with Q2 (N ).\n\n(31)\n\nwhere nT1 (nT2 ) quantifies the thermal photons in the\nprobing (reference) mode, nS = sinh2 r quantifies the\ntwo-mode squeezing energy, and the last energetic term is\na cross term. In this case, besides the squeezing factor \u03b22 ,\nwe can also introduce an asymmetry parameter \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 1]\nwhich quantifies the fraction of thermal energy used for\nthe probing mode. In other words, we can write\nnS =\n\nA.\n\n(29)\n\nThus the single-mode squeezed thermal state can be\nparametrized as \u03c1 = \u03c1(N1 , \u03b21 ), i.e., in terms of its total energy N1 and the squeezing factor \u03b21 . Note that\nfor \u03b21 = 0 the state is completely thermal with energy\nN1 = nT , while for \u03b21 = 1 the state is a squeezed vacuum\nwith energy N1 = nS . In our problem of loss detection\n(\u0393 = 0 versus \u0393 > 0), we denote by Q1 (N1 , \u03b21 ) the output QCB which is computed by using the input state\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(N1 , \u03b21 ).\nNow, given a two-mode squeezed thermal state \u03c1 =\n\u03c1(r, nT1 , nT2 ), its total energy can be written as\nN2 = nT1 + nT2 + 2nS + 2nS (nT1 + nT2 ) ,\n\nthermal energy nT1 = \u03b3 N2 , and the other one describing\nthe reference mode with thermal energy nT2 = (1\u2212\u03b3)N2 .\nFor \u03b22 = 1 we have instead a two-mode squeezed vacuum\nstate with total energy N2 = 2nS . In this case, the thermal energy is zero and \u03b3 can be therefore arbitrary. In\nour problem of loss detection (\u0393 = 0 versus \u0393 > 0), we\ndenote by Q2 (N2 , \u03b22 , \u03b3) the output QCB which is computed by using the input state \u03c1 = \u03c1(N2 , \u03b22 , \u03b3).\n\n(32)\n(33)\n(34)\n\nThus the two-mode squeezed thermal state can be\nparametrized as \u03c1 = \u03c1(N2 , \u03b22 , \u03b3), i.e., in terms of the\ntotal energy N2 , the squeezing factor \u03b22 , and the asymmetry parameter \u03b3. Note that for \u03b22 = 0 we have two\nthermal states, one describing the probing mode with\n\nQ\n1.0\n\nQ\n1.0\n\nQ\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nN\n5 10 15 20 25\n\nN\n5 10 15 20 25\n\nN\n5 10 15 20 25\n\nFIG. 2: Output QCB Q1 (N, \u03b21 ) optimized over input singlemode squeezed thermal states \u03c1 = \u03c1(N, \u03b21 ). From left to right\nwe consider different values of the transmissivity: \u03b7 = 0.1 (left\npanel), \u03b7 = 0.5 (middle panel) and \u03b7 = 0.9 (right panel). In\neach panel, we plot Q1 (N, \u03b21 ) as function of the energy N\nfor different values of \u03b21 .

(36) and (37) the\ninfima are achieved for \u03b21 = \u03b22 = 1. This is numerically\nshown in Fig. 2 for the single-mode case and in Fig. 3 for\nthe two-mode case. Thus, we have found that, at fixed\ninput energy N , the optimal thermal probes are given by\nsingle- and two-mode squeezed vacuum states. In this\ncase, the input state is pure and the QCB corresponds to\nthe fidelity (which is the case when the s-overlap in Eq.\n(3) is minimized for s approching the border). Let us\nadopt the transmissivity \u03b7 = e\u2212\u0393 to quantify the damping of the channel, so that \u0393 = 0 (ideal channel) corresponds to \u03b7 = 1, and \u0393 > 0 (lossy channel) corresponds\nto 0 \u2264 \u03b7 < 1.

As expected the discrimination improves by increasing the input energy N\nand decreasing the transmissivity \u03b7.\nAs we can see from Fig. 4, for a given value of the\ntransmissivity \u03b7, the two-mode QCB Q2 (N ) outperforms\nthe single-mode QCB Q1 (N ) only after a threshold energy. In fact, for any value of the transmissivity \u03b7\nlarger than a critical value \u03b7c there is a threshold energy\nNth = Nth (\u03b7) that makes the two-mode squeezed vacuum\nstate more convenient than the single-mode counterpart.\nThis threshold energy decreases for decreasing values of\n\u03b7. In particular, for transmissivities less than the critical\nvalue \u03b7c , the threshold energy becomes zero, i.e., the twomode state is always better than single-mode state. We\nhave numerically evaluated the critical value \u03b7c \u2243 0.296\n(corresponding to \u0393c \u2243 1.22).

In\nparticular, note that Nth = 0 at \u03b7 = \u03b7c . Close to the\ncritical transmissivity we have [56]\nNth \u2243 4(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c ) + 5.5(\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7c )2 .\nB.\n\n(40)\n\nOptimal input at fixed energy and squeezing\n\nIt should be said that, in realistic conditions, it is unlikely to have pure squeezing. For this reason, it is im-\n\n\f10\nportant to investigate the performances of the squeezed\nthermal states by fixing this physical parameter together\nwith the total energy. Thus, in this section, we fix both\nthe input energy and squeezing, i.e., we set\nN1 = N2 = N,\n\u03b21 = \u03b22 = \u03b2 (0 \u2264 \u03b2 \u2264 1) .\n\n(41)\n\nThen, we compare the single-mode squeezed thermal\nstate \u03c1 = \u03c1(N, \u03b2) with the two-mode squeezed thermal\nstates \u03c1 = \u03c1(N, \u03b2, \u03b3) for various values of \u03b3. In other\nwords, we compare Q1 (N, \u03b2) and Q2 (N, \u03b2, \u03b3).\nFor fixed N and \u03b2, we find that the minimum of\nQ2 (N, \u03b2, \u03b3) is achieved for \u03b3 = 1 (easy to check numerically). This means that two-mode discrimination is easier\nwhen all the thermal photons are sent through the lossy\nchannel. In this case we find numerically that\nQ2 (N, \u03b2, 1) < Q1 (N, \u03b2) ,\nfor every values of the input parameters N and \u03b2, and\nevery value of damping rate \u0393 in the channel. In other\nwords, at fixed energy and squeezing, there is a two-mode\nsqueezed thermal state (the asymmetric one with \u03b3 =\n1) able to outperform the single-mode squeezed thermal\nstate in the detection of any loss. In order to quantify\nthe improvement we introduce the QCB reduction\n\u2206Q = Q1 (N, \u03b2) \u2212 Q2 (N, \u03b2, 1).\nThe more positive this quantity is, the more convenient is\nthe use of the two-mode state instead of the single-mode\none. In Fig. 6 we show the behavior of \u2206Q as function\nof the input energy and squeezing for two different values\nof the damping. As one can see from the plot, the QCB\nreduction is always positive. Its value increases with the\nenergy while reaching a maximum for intermediate values\nof the squeezing. By comparing the two panels of Fig. 6,\nwe can also note that the QCB reduction increases for\nincreasing damping \u0393 (i.e., decreasing transmissivity).\nN\n8\n\nof any loss \u0393. Here we also show that this is approximately true for \u03b3 . 1. In other words, we show that the\ninequality Q2 (N, \u03b2, \u03b3) < Q1 (N, \u03b2) is robust against fluctuations of \u03b3 below the optimal value \u03b3 = 1. This property is clearly important for practical implementations.\nTo study this situation, let us consider the \u03b3-dependent\nQCB reduction\n\u2206Q\u03b3 = Q1 (N, \u03b2) \u2212 Q2 (N, \u03b2, \u03b3) .\n\n(42)\n\nIn Fig. 7 we have specified this quantity for different values of the asymmetry parameter \u03b3 (each panel refers to\na different value of \u03b3). Then, for every chosen \u03b3, we have\ncomputed \u2206Q\u03b3 over a sample of 103 random values of\nN , \u03b2, and \u0393 (in each panel).

The quantification of the correlations is realized by using the entanglement, the quantum discord and\nthe quantum mutual information. In order to quantify\nthe degree of entanglement of a two-mode Gaussian state,\nwe can use the logarithmic negativity. Let us consider a\nbipartite Gaussian state with CM given in Eq. (13). It is\neasy to derive the symplectic eigenvalues of the partially\ntransposed state.

We have that, for 0 \u2264\nD \u2264 1, the state may be either entangled or separable,\nwhereas all the states with D > 1 are entangled [38, 39].\nFinally, the quantum mutual information, which quantifies the amount of total, classical plus quantum, correlations, is given by I = S(\u03c1A ) + S(\u03c1B ) \u2212 S(\u03c1AB ), where\nS(\u03c1) = \u2212 Tr[\u03c1 log \u03c1] is the von Neumann entropy of the\nstate \u03c1 and \u03c1A(B) = TrB(A) [\u03c1AB ] are the partial traces\nover the two subsystems. For a two-mode squeezed thermal state with CM as in Eq. (15) the quantum mutual\ninformation can be computed using the formula\ni\np\n1h p\nh( I1 ) + h( I2 ) \u2212 h(d+ ) \u2212 h(d\u2212 ) .\nI=\n2\n\nFor pure states the previous three measures are equivalent, whereas for mixed states, as in the case under investigation in this section, they generally quantify different\nkind of correlations. Here we consider the QCB reduction\n\u2206Q\u03b3\u0304 = Q1 (N, \u03b2) \u2212 Q2 (N, \u03b2, \u03b3\u0304) between a single-mode\nsqueezed thermal state \u03c1 = \u03c1(N, \u03b2) and a two-mode\nsqueezed thermal state \u03c1 = \u03c1(N, \u03b2, \u03b3\u0304) with \u03b3\u0304 = 0.999.\nBy fixing the input squeezing \u03b2 and varying the input\nenergy N , we study the behaviour of \u2206Q\u03b3\u0304 as function\nof the three correlation quantifiers, i.e., quantum mutual\ninformation, quantum discord and entanglement (computed over the input two-mode state).\nAs shown in the upper panels of Fig. 8, the QCB reduction \u2206Q\u03b3\u0304 is an increasing function of all the three\ncorrelation quantifiers for fixed input squeezing (\u03b2 = 0.1\nfor the left panel and \u03b2 = 0.9 for the right one). Note\nthat, in each panel and for each quantifier, we plot three\ndifferent curves corresponding to different values of the\ndamping \u0393 = 0.9, 0.5 and 0.1. The monotonicity of\nthe QCB reduction in all the correlation quantifiers suggests that the presence of correlations should definitely\n\n\u2206Q \u03b3\u2212\n\n\u2206Q \u03b3\u2212\n\n0.25\n\n0.14\n0.12\n0.10\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nX\n0.8\n\nE\n0.068\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n0.034\n0.085\n0.051\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nX\n\n2.0\n\nE\n\n0.08\n0.24\n0.12\n\n1.0\n0.5\n\n0.017\n0.5\n\n0.16\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n0.04\n0.5\n\nD\n2.0\n\nE\n2.5\n\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n3\n\nD\n2.0\n\nD\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nI\n\n1\n\n4\n\nI\n\nFIG. 8: (Color online) Upper panels.

In other words, employing the input squeezing in the form of correlations\nis always beneficial for loss detection when we consider\nsqueezed thermal states as input sources. The importance of correlations is confirmed by the plots in the middle panels. Here we consider again the QCB reduction\n\u2206Q\u03b3\u0304 = Q1 (N, \u03b2) \u2212 Q2 (N, \u03b2, \u03b3\u0304) for \u03b3\u0304 = 0.999. Then, by\nvarying input squeezing \u03b2 and energy N , we study \u2206Q\u03b3\u0304\nas function of both discord and entanglement (damping\nis \u0393 = 0.2 in the left panel, and \u0393 = 0.8 in the right\none). These plots show how the QCB reduction is approximately an increasing function of both discord and\nentanglement. Finally, in the lower panels of Fig. 8, we\nalso show how entanglement (left) and discord (right)\nare increasing functions of the quantum mutual information with good approximation (these plots are generated\n\n\f12\nby choosing a random sample of 104 two-mode squeezed\nthermal states).\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have considered the quantum discrimination of lossy channels. In particular, we have focused to\nthe case when one of the two channels is the identity, i.e.,\nthe problem of discriminating the presence of a damping\nprocess from its absence (loss detection). For this kind\nof discriminination we have considered thermal probes as\ninput, i.e., single- and two-mode squeezed thermal states.\nThe performance of the channel discrimination has been\nquantified using the QCB, computed over the two possible states at the output of the unknown channel for\na given input state. Finding the optimal input state \u03c1\nwhich minimizes this bound gives automatically the optimal multi-copy state \u03c1\u2297 \u03c1\u2297 * * * when we consider many\naccesses to the unknown channel (under the assumption\nof single-copy constraints). In this scenario, we have\nfixed the total energy of the input state and optimized\nthe discrimination (detection of loss) over the class of\nsingle- and two-mode squeezed thermal states. We have\nfound numerically that the optimal states are pure, thus\ncorresponding to single- and two-mode squeezed vacuum\nstates. Furthermore, we have determined the conditions\nwhere the two-mode state outperforms the single-mode\ncounterpart. This happens when the energy exceeds a\ncertain threshold, which becomes zero for suitably low\nvalues of the transmissivity (i.e., high values of damping).\nIt is worth noticing that our approach (where we fix\nthe total energy of probing and reference modes) also\ngives a sufficient condition for the problem where only\nthe probing energy is fixed. In fact, if a two-mode state\noutperforms a single-mode state above a certain threshold value Nth of the total energy, this also happens when\njust the energy of the probing mode is above that value\nNth . This is a trivial consequence of the fact that the\ntotal energy is bigger than the probing energy for twomode states (N2 > N2probe ) while the two quantities are\n\n[1] H.-P. Breuer and F.

Thus,\nN2probe = N1probe > Nth can be written as N2 > N1 >\nNth which is a stronger condition than N2 = N1 > Nth ,\nsince the QCB is decreasing in the total energy, as one\ncan see from Eqs. (38) and (39).\nIn our investigation we have then considered the problem of loss detection in more realistic conditions, where\nit is unlikely to have pure squeezing. In this case, we\nhave studied the optimal state for fixed total energy\nand squeezing, i.e., by fixing all the relevant resources\nneeded to create the input state. Under these constraints,\nwe have shown that a two-mode squeezed thermal state\nwhich conveys all the thermal photons in the dissipative\nchannel is the optimal thermal probe. In addition, this\nresult is robust against fluctuations, i.e., it holds approximately also when the thermal photons are distributed\nin a more balanced way between the probe mode (sent\nthrough the dissipative channel) and the reference mode\n(bypassing the channel).\nFinally we have closely investigated the role of correlations in our problem of loss detection. We have found\nthat, for fixed input squeezing, the reduction of the QCB\nis an increasing function of several correlation quantifiers,\nsuch as the quantum entanglement, the quantum discord\nand the quantum mutual information. We then verify\nthat employing the input squeezing in the form of correlations (quantum or classical) is always beneficial for the\ndetection of loss by means of thermal probes.\nThe results of our paper provides new elements in the\nfield of quantum channel discrimination and can be applied to a wide range applications, including the characterization of absorbing materials. In particular, they\nare relevant in all the situations where the physical constraints regard the creation of the input resources rather\nthan the channel to be discriminated.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank Marco Genoni, Stefano Olivares\nand Samuel L.
