The physical mechanism for the instability relies on the fact that a light fluid\n(represented by the magnetic field) supports a heavy fluid (represented by the gas) and\nthe configuration tends to overturn. It has similarities to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability,\nwhen a true light fluid supports a heavy fluid. In the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, the fastest\ngrowing mode has an infinite perturbation wavenumber. However, taking into account a\n\"uni-directional\" magnetic field along the azimuthal direction in the Galactic disk, Parker\n(1966) showed that the magnetic tension stabilizes large wavenumber perturbations and\nresults in a preferred, finite wavenumber. But when the perturbations along the radial\ndirection are allowed, those with an infinite radial wavenumber prevail (Parker 1967). As a\nresult, the structures formed by the Parker instability are expected to be elongated, and Kim\net al. (1998) confirmed it through three-dimensional simulations for the nonlinear evolution\nof the Parker instability.\nThe Parker instability in the interstellar medium (ISM) has been thought to be a viable\nmechanism in forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in the Galaxy (see, e.g., Appenzeller\n1974; Mouschovias et al. 1974; Blitz & Shu 1980). However, the work of Kim et al. (1998)\nraised negative points on that. In addition to the fact that sheet-like structures with the\nsmallest scale in the radial direction are formed, they found that the enhancement factor\nof column density is at most \u223c 2. The second density issue is eased by noting that the\ninterstellar gas can be further susceptible to the thermal instability, as pointed in Parker &\nJopikii (2000), followed by the gravitational instability. However, the first structural issue,\nwhich is the direct result of the infinitesimal radial wavenumber, does not easily go away.\nSeveral ideas on effects that could suppress the maximally unstable nature of the mode\nwith an infinite wavenumber have been suggested. One of them is to invoke a \"stochastic\nmagnetic field\" (Parker & Jopikii 2000), which represents the random component of the\nGalactic magnetic field. Using a field composed of the usual mean component and a transverse component whose strength is weak and random, they showed that in \"cold plasma\"\n(without gas pressure) the weak, random component exerts a significant stabilizing effect on\nthe perturbations with small transverse wavelengths. The physical mechanism is the following. Although weak, the tension of the transverse component that is incurred by the vertical\ngas motions is strong enough to reinstate the gas. They suggested the possibility of preferred\nmodes with finite transverse (radial) wavenumbers. Such modes would result in broadened\nstructures, which would resemble more the morphology of the GMCs. Their stochastic field\nmodel is promising in the sense that i) it is consistent with the turbulent picture of the ISM\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n(see, e.g., Minter & Spangler 1996) and ii) it is supported by the observations of magnetic\nfield in our Galaxy and spiral galaxies (see, e.g., Beck et al. 1996; Zweibel & Heiles 1997).\nHowever, their cold plasma approximation needs to be improved.\nThe purpose of this paper is to analyze fully the effects of the random component of the\nmagnetic field on the Parker instability in a medium with finite gas pressure. We find rather\nsurprising results that the random component either reduces the growth of the instability\nsignificantly or suppresses it completely. And the most unstable mode has a vanishing radial\nwavenumber. The plan of the paper is as follows. Linear stability analysis is carried out by\nanalyzing the dispersion relation in \u00a72. Summary and discussion follow in \u00a73.\n2.\n\nLinear Stability Analysis\n\nWe consider the stability of an equilibrium system where gas is supported by its own\nand magnetic pressures against a \"uniform\" gravity, g, in the negative z (vertical) direction.\nWith realistic gravities different growth rates and wavelengths of unstable modes would\nresult (see, e.g., Kim et al. 1997), but they make the analysis much more involved. In\naddition, we expect the qualitative features of the stability wouldn't be affected by details\nof gravity. For the magnetic field configuration, the stochastic model suggested by Parker &\nJopikii (2000) is adopted. It is composed of a mean component, B(z), in the y (azimuthal)\ndirection, and a random component, \u01eb(z)B(z), in the x (radial) direction. \u01eb(z) is a random\nfunction of z with zero mean. One assumption made on \u01eb(z) is that the correlation length\nis small compared to the vertical scale height of the system. So in the equations below, the\nlocal average is taken by integrating over z for a vertical scale greater than the correlation\nlength of \u01eb(z) but smaller than the scale height. Then, the dispersion h\u01eb2 i is taken as a\nconstant, which becomes a free parameter of the analysis. With finite gas pressure, p, the\nmagnetohydrostatic equilibrium is governed by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2\nd\n2 B\np + (1 + h\u01eb i)\n= \u2212\u03c1g,\n(1)\ndz\n8\u03c0\nwhere \u03c1 is gas density. Two further assumptions are made, which are usual in the analysis of\nthe Parker instability: i) an isothermal equation of state, p = a2s \u03c1, where as is the isothermal\nspeed, and ii) a constant ratio of magnetic to gas pressures, \u03b1 = (1 + h\u01eb2 i)B 2 /(8\u03c0p). Then\nexponential distributions of density, gas pressure, and magnetic pressure are obtained\n\u0013\n\u0012\np(z)\nB 2 (z)\n|z|\n\u03c1(z)\n(2)\n=\n= 2\n= exp \u2212\n\u03c1(0)\np(0)\nB (0)\nH ,\nwhere the e-folding scale height, H, is given by (1 + \u03b1)a2s /g.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe above equilibrium state is disturbed with an infinitesimal perturbation. The perturbed system is assumed to be isothermal too. Since linearized perturbation equations for\nthe case without gas pressure were already derived (Parker & Jopikii 2000), the detailed\nderivation is not repeated here. Instead, a reduced form in terms of velocity perturbations,\n(vx , vy , vz ), is written down as follows:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202 2 vx\n\u2202vx \u2202vy \u2202vz\nvz\n2 \u2202\n= as\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2202t2\n\u2202x \u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\nH\n\u0014 2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n2\nh\u01eb2 i \u2202vz\n\u2202 vx\n\u2202 \u2202vz\nvz\n2 \u2202 vx\n+ vA\n\u2212\n(3)\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202x2\n\u2202x \u2202z\n2H\n2H \u2202x ,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202vx \u2202vy \u2202vz\nvz\n\u2202 2 vy\n2 \u2202\n= as\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2202t2\n\u2202y \u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\nH\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\u001b\n\u0014 2\n\u001a\n\u2202 vy \u2202 2 vy\n\u2202 \u2202vz\nvz\n1 \u2202vz\n2\n2\n+ h\u01eb i\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+ vA \u2212\n2H \u2202y\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202y \u2202z\n2H\n,\n\u2202 2 vz\n\u2202t2\n\n(4)\n\n\u0013\n\u2202vx \u2202vy \u2202vz\nvz\n=\n+\n+\n\u2212\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\nH\n\u0013 \u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0012\n2\n\u2202vx\n\u2202\n1\n1\n\u2202\n\u2202 vz\n2\nvz +\n+\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ vA\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202z H\n\u2202z 2H\n\u2202x\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2202vx \u2202vy \u2202vz\nvz\n1\n+\n+\n\u2212\n+\n2H \u2202x\n\u2202y\n\u2202z\nH\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\u001b\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n1\n1\n1 \u2202vy \u2202 2 vz\n2\n+h\u01eb i\nvz +\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n(5)\n\u2202z H\n\u2202z 2H\n\u2202z H \u2202y\n\u2202x2\n.\n\u221a\nHere, vA is the Alfv\u00e9n speed, B/ 4\u03c0\u03c1, which is constant over z.

(7) is a cubic equation of \u03a92 with complex coefficients. For the case with vanishing\nvertical wavenumber (qz = 0), all the C coefficients become real, and the dispersion relation\ncan be easily solved. For small vertical wavenumbers, the imaginary terms, ih\u01eb2 iqz and\nih\u01eb2 i2 qz in C4 and C2 , can be still ignored. This trick doesn't affect the marginal condition of\nthe stability (\u03a9 = 0), since C0 doesn't contain any imaginary term. Here, we remind readers\nof the definition of \u03b1. It is reserved in this paper for the ratio of magnetic to gas pressures,\nwhereas it was used for the dispersion of \u01eb in Parker & Jopikii (2000). For the dispersion\nh\u01eb2 i is used in this paper.\n\nTwo limiting cases can be considered, which enable us to check the validity of the above\nrelation. The formula with h\u01eb2 i = 0 reduces to the dispersion relation for the original Parker\ninstability (see, e.g., Parker 1967; Shu 1974). The C's without the terms containing h\u01eb2 i\nmatch exactly with the coefficients of Eq. (53) in (Shu 1974), after imposing the isothermal\ncondition \u03b3 = 1. The other limiting formula is for the cold plasma with p = 0 (Parker &\nJopikii 2000). As shown above, our linearized perturbation equations recover those for the\ncold plasma.\nThe full stability property can be analyzed by solving the above dispersion relation\nnumerically. Fig. 1 shows the stability diagram for \u03b1 = 1. Equi-\u03a92 contours with positive\nvalues corresponding to unstable modes are plotted on the (qx2 , qy2 ) plane for a few different\nvalues of h\u01eb2 i1/2 . qz = 0 has been set. Finite qz 's reduce the growth rate (see, e.g., Parker\n\n(9)\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n1966). Three interesting points can be made: with increasing strength of the random component, i) the domain of the instability in the (qx2 , qy2 ) plane shrinks, ii) the maximum growth\nrate decreases, and iii) the qx,max , which gives the maximum growth rate, decreases and\nreduces to zero eventually. Note that without the random component, h\u01eb2 i1/2 = 0, the most\nunstable mode has the growth rate \u03a92 = 0.172 and the radial wavenumber qx,max \u2192 \u221e.\nThe above points can be seen more clearly in Fig. 2, which shows the growth rate and\ntwo horizontal wavenumbers of the most unstable modes as a function of h\u01eb2 i1/2 for three\ndifferent values of \u03b1. Again, qz = 0 has been set. Note that the scale height H changes with\n\u03b1. Hence, both the growth rate and wavenumber in real units scale as 1/(1 + \u03b1). Even after\nthis factor is taken into account, the maximum growth rate increases with \u03b1, due to enhanced\n1/2\nmagnetic buoyancy. Two additional points can be made: i) the critical value h\u01eb2 ic , above\nwhich the Parker instability disappears completely, is independent of \u03b1, and it is computed\n\u221a\nas 1/ 2 = 0.707 from the dispersion relation, and ii) the value of h\u01eb2 i1/2 , above which the\nradial wavenumber of the most unstable mode vanishes, decreases with increasing \u03b1. These\nare the consequences of different roles of uniform and random magnetic fields.\nOn the issue of the formation of GMCs, the most interesting range of the values would be\nh\u01eb i \u223c 0.1, which would result in qx \u223c qy for the most unstable modes (although it would\ndepend on \u03b1, see Fig. 2). Then, the structures formed as the result of the instability would\nbe round, so mimicking GMCs. However, observations suggest a larger random component.\nIt is generally quoted that in the Galactic plane 0.5 . h\u01eb2 i1/2 . 1, with the strength of the\ntotal magnetic field B \u223c 3 \u2212 4\u03bcG (see, e.g., Beck et al. 1996; Zweibel & Heiles 1997).\nBut others such as Minter & Spangler (1996) suggest somewhat smaller values such as\nh\u01eb2 i1/2 \u223c 1/4 \u2212 1/3. If 0.5 . h\u01eb2 i1/2 . 1, the instability disappears completely or the growth\nrate reduces significantly by more than 80%. If h\u01eb2 i1/2 \u223c 1/4 \u2212 1/3, the growth rate reduces\nby 30 \u2212 60%. But in any case the radial wavenumber of the most unstable mode shrinks to\nzero (qx = 0). That is, the instability basically becomes two-dimensional in the plane defined\nby the azimuthal and vertical directions. This result is opposite to that of h\u01eb2 i1/2 = 0, where\nthe dominant mode of the instability has vanishing radial wavelength (qx \u2192 \u221e).\n2 1/2\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion and Summary\n\nThe Parker instability is induced by the magnetic buoyancy of uniform component of\nmagnetic field, while gas pressure and random component exert stabilizing effects. The role\nof gas pressure is mainly exercising pressure force along the uniform component, and set finite\nwavenumbers for the instability along the uniform component direction. On the other hand,\nrandom component threads rising and sinking slices across the uniform field. Its tension\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nbecomes stronger at larger wavenumbers. So the role of the random field is to suppress the\ngrowth of perturbations with large wavenumbers perpendicular to the uniform field.\nThrough the linear stability analysis which includes both gas pressure and random\nmagnetic field, we have found that with the observationally favored values for the strength\nof the random component, 0.5 . h\u01eb2 i1/2 . 1, the tension of the random component that is\nincurred by the vertical gas motions is strong enough that the growth of the instability is\neither significantly reduced or completely suppressed. For smaller values, h\u01eb2 i1/2 \u223c 1/4\u22121/3,\nwhich are suggested by others, the Parker instability is still operating but with reduced\ngrowth rate and vanishing radial wavenumber. With h\u01eb2 i1/2 \u223c 1/4 \u2212 1/3, by taking H = 160\npc and as = 6.4 km/s (Falgarone & Lequeux 1973), the growth time scale and the azimuthal\nwavelength of the most unstable mode are 70\u221295 Myrs and \u223c 2.2 kpc, respectively. They are\ntoo large for the Parker instability to be a plausible mechanism for the formation of GMCs.\nBut it is known that realistic gravity would reduce both (see, e.g., Kim et al. 1997).\nThe more serious obstacle in the context of the GMC formation is the fact that the radial\nwavelength of the most unstable mode is infinity. This indicates the structures formed\nwould be elongated, in this case, along the radial direction. But it is not clear whether\nsuch elongated structures would persist in the stage of the nonlinear development of the\ninstability. That should be tested by numerical simulations.\nThe work was supported in part by KRF through grant KRF-2000-015-DS0046. We\nthank Dr. R. Jokipii for discussions and Dr. T. W.
