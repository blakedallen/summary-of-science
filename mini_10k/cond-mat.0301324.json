At 4.2 K an abrupt and hysteretic increase in resistance is observed at high current densities\nfor one polarity of the current, comparable to the giant magnetoresistance (GMR) effect observed at\nlow fields.

Slonscewski and Berger first\nconsidered this theoretically in 1996 [1, 2]. Its experimental observation a few years later [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] has\nboosted efforts to understand the influence of the conduction electron spin on the magnetization dynamics of\nferromagnetic nanostructures in the presence of high electric currents. A spin current has been demonstrated to\nswitch the magnetization direction of a small magnetic element. Reversible changes in multilayer resistance have\nalso been observed and associated with magnetic excitations or the generation of spin waves. However, an indepth understanding of the relationship between these\ntwo phenomena\u2013reversible excitations of the magnetization and irreversible switching of the magnetization\u2013is\nstill missing.\nIn the initial experiments a point contact was employed\nto inject high current densities into a magnetic multilayer\n[3, 6, 7]. Subsequent experiments have concentrated on\nthe reduction of the lateral size of Co/Cu/Co trilayers\nto the sub-micron scale, resulting in the fabrication of\nnanopillar devices [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In the point\ncontact experiments the applied magnetic field was oriented perpendicular to the thin film plane and was larger\nthan the film demagnetization fields (H\u22652 T). In this\nhigh field regime a peak structure in the differential resistance (dV/dI) at a critical current was interpreted as\nthe onset of current induced excitation of spin waves in\nwhich the current induced spin-transfer torque leads to\nthe uniform precession of the magnetization [3, 6, 15].\nSpin-transfer torque studies on pillar devices concentrated on magnetic fields applied in the thin film plane.\nIn the low-field regime, a hysteretic jump in the differential resistance was observed; clear evidence for current\ninduced magnetization reversal of one of the magnetic\n\nlayers[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Hence, the effect of the\nspin-polarized current on the magnetization seemed to\nbe quite distinct in the low and high field regime. Experimentally, a current induced hysteretic magnetization reversal was only observed at low in-plane fields in nanopillar devices.\nIn this letter we report detailed studies of current\ninduced dynamics of the magnetization in sub-micron\nsize pillar devices at high magnetic fields in the fieldperpendicular to the plane geometry. For sufficiently\nlarge currents of one polarity hysteretic magnetic switching of the layers is observed at high magnetic fields.\nIn contrast to previous results in this geometry with\nmechanical point contacts, these results cannot be understood as small amplitude excitations of the magnetization. Micromagnetic modeling suggests that spintransfer torques induce precessional states which evolve\ninto a static state of antiparallel alignment of the layers.\nSub-micron size pillar devices with the stack sequence\nof |3nm Co|10nm Cu|12nm Co|300nm Cu|10nm Pt| were\nfabricated by thermal and electron-beam evaporation\nthrough a sub-micron stencil mask [13]. TEM images\nshow that this approach produces pillar devices with\nsteep side wall angles (\u223c 7\u25e6 )[14]. The thin Co-layer has\na lower coercivity and is the \"free\" layer in the device.\nThe thick o-layer is the \"fixed\" layer in the device and\nacts to setup a spin-polarized current in the intervening\nCu layer. The inset in Fig. 1(a) shows a sketch of the\npillar device. Details of fabrication and transport properties at low in-plane fields can be found elsewhere [14].\nMany junctions were studied thoroughly as a function\nof current and applied magnetic field. In this paper, we\ndiscuss representative data obtained on a sample of lateral size 90 nm \u00d7 140 nm.

The inset shows\nthe layers sequence (in nm) and the 4-point measurement geometry. (b) dV/dI versus I of the same device. The applied\nfield is H=2.2 T and oriented perpendicular to the film plane.\nAt a critical current a peak structure occurs in the differential\nresistance. The dotted line shows dV/dI at negative currents,\nfor which the peak structure is absent. The inset shows the\nsimultaneous dc-voltage measurement.\n\ndV/dI was measured by means of phase-sensitive lock-in\ntechnique with a 100 \u03bcA modulation current at f =800 Hz\nadded to a dc bias current. The dc voltage was recorded\nsimultaneously. We define positive bias such that the\nelectrons flow from the free layer to the static layer.\nA typical magnetoresistance (MR) measurement of our\npillar devices at 4.2 K with an applied field in the plane\nof the thin films is shown in Fig. 1(a). The device exhibits a clean transition between a low resistance and\nhigh resistance state corresponding to parallel (P) and\nantiparallel alignment (AP) of the magnetization of the\ntwo Co-layers. At 4.2 K the MR of this sample is 5.4\n%. Due to magnetostatic interactions between the layers, the high resistance state is reached before the sign of\nH is reversed[8, 12].\nFig. 1(b) shows dV/dI versus I with the applied field\nperpendicular to the film. Here the applied field (H=2.2\nT) is larger than the demagnetization field of Co thin\nfilms (4\u03c0M \u2248 1.5 T). The sweep to negative currents is\nshown as the dashed line in the figure. From the data\nit is evident that the abrupt change in resistance occurs\nonly for one current direction. In addition, the onset\nof this change in resistance is sharp and takes place at\na critical current, Ic (jc \u2248 2.3 \u00d7 108 A/cm2 ). Its characteristic signature is a peak structure in the differential resistance measurements. In the simultaneous dcmeasurement [shown as inset in Fig. 2(b)] this feature\ncorresponds to a step-like increase of the dc-voltage. The\nparabolic increase in the background resistance for both\ndirections of the current is due to increased electron scat-\n\ntering at high current densities. However, thermal effects\ncannot explain the abrupt and hysteretic change in device resistance: these features are absent in pillar devices\nwith only a single Co-layer (2nm \u2264 t \u2264 19nm) for current densities up to 1.7 \u00d7 109 A/cm2 [16].\nIn earlier reports the peak structure in the differential\nresistance of point contacts was attributed to the excitation of a uniform precession of the free layer [3, 6, 15].\nHowever, this picture cannot explain our data. First, the\nresistance change is large. This can be seen by either\nlooking at the change of slope in the dc-voltage at the\ncritical current Ic or by comparing the differential resistance for I greater than Ic with the differential resistance\nat the same current value but with opposite polarity at\nwhich the abrupt change in resistance is absent. Either\ncomparison shows a change in resistance of about 5 %,\nsimilar to the GMR value of the same device [Fig. 1(a)].\nTherefore, an explanation in terms of a small deviation\nof the free layer magnetization from its parallel alignment with respect to the static layer is not sufficient to\nexplain the observed resistance change. With the measurement of a resistance change comparable to the GMR\neffect, it seems plausible to assume that even at high\nfields the spin transfer effect can produce a full reversal\nof the magnetization[17]. Second, the change in device\nresistance is hysteretic, occurring at higher current density for increasing current [Fig. 1(b)]. The excitations\nof spin waves would decay rapidly on the time scale of\nsuch measurements and thus appear reversible in such\nI-V measurements. Further, as we show below, this interpretation is consistent with micromagnetic modeling.\nThe experimental results of the magnetic field dependence of the critical current is summarized in Fig. 2(a),\nin which the differential resistance is plotted in a grayscale. Here the current is swept up from 20 mA to 36\nmA while the magnetic field is held constant for each\ncurrent sweep. For subsequent current sweeps the field is\nraised from 0.34 T to 2.7 T in steps of 5 mT. In this grayscale plot a critical current Ic separates the \"applied fieldcurrent bias\" plane into two regions. Below the critical\ncurrent the device remains in its low resistance state, in\nwhich both layers are in the parallel orientation. Above\nthe critical current, the magnetization of the device is in\na higher resistance state, in which the relative orientation\nof the magnetization of the two layers deviates strongly\nfrom a parallel configuration.\nThe critical current for decreasing current is shown\nas the dashed line in this figure. Looking at the field\ndependence of the hysteresis \u2206Ic and the field dependence of the critical current Ic , one can distinguish two\nregions. Above 1.4 T the critical current increases with\napplied magnetic field. In this region also \u2206Ic generally increases with increasing field. (There is a deviation\nfrom this behavior between 2.0 T and 2.4 T, in which\n\u2206Ic actually decreases. We suspect this to be due to the\nonset of non-uniform excitations that would reduce the\nhysteresis.) However, below 1.2 T the critical current decreases linearly with applied magnetic field. In this field\n\n\f3\nFIG. 2: (a) Magnetic field dependence of dV/dI versus I. The\ngray scale represents the differential resistance of the junction. Light color corresponds to high resistance and dark to\nlow resistance. The dashed line shows the position of the\njump in resistance for down-sweep of the bias current. (b)\nMicromagnetic simulations of the experiment as described in\nthe text.\n\nregion (1.1 T \u2192 0.35 T), the hysteresis is near the limit\nof our experimental resolution. The resistance jumps for\nboth regions are similar in magnitude, i.e. close to the\nGMR value. To understand these results we consider\nthe Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equations of motion\nfor the free layer including a spin-current induced torque\npredicted by Slonczewski [1, 15]:\ndm\u0302\n~ ef f \u2212 \u03b1 dm\u0302 ] + aI m\u0302 \u00d7 (m\u0302 \u00d7 m\u0302P )\n= \u2212m\u0302 \u00d7 [H\n\u03b3dt\n\u03b3dt\n\n(1)\n\nThis zero-temperature, monodomain model is sufficient to understand the basic physics of spin-transferinduced magnetic excitations [19]. Here m\u0302 and m\u0302P are\n3D-unit vectors in the directions of the magnetization of\n~ ef f is the effective\nthe free and fixed layer respectively. H\n~\n~\n~ is the applied\nfield, Hef f = H \u2212 4\u03c0M (m\u0302 * \u1e91)\u1e91, where H\nexternal field, \u1e91 is the film normal and 4\u03c0M = 1.5T for\nCo. \u03b3 is the gyromagnetic ratio. The second term in the\nbrackets is the damping term and \u03b1 is the Gilbert damping parameter (\u03b1 << 1). The last term incorporates the\nspin-transfer effects. The prefactor, aI , depends on the\ncurrent, the spin-polarization of the current P and the\nangle between the free and pinned magnetic layers \u0398,\n~I\naI = eMV\ng(P, \u0398) [1]. Here g is a function of the polarization P that increases with \u0398 and V is the volume of\nmagnetic element. An increase in aI with angle has been\nfound in a number of different approaches to modeling\nthe spin-transfer effect [20, 21, 22, 23].\nIn the large field regime (H > 4\u03c0M ) the equation of\nmotion can be simplified. Initially both layers are parallel\nto the applied field and the z-component of the free layer\nmagnetization satisfies (neglecting terms of order \u03b12 ):\ndmz\n= (1 \u2212 m2z )[\u03b1(H \u2212 4\u03c0M mz ) \u2212 aI ]\n\u03b3dt\n\n(2)\n\nFrom this equation it can be seen that an initial state\nmz = 1 aligned with the applied field in the z direction\nwill become unstable when aI > \u03b1(H \u2212 4\u03c0M mz ). States\nz\nfor which |mz | < 1 and dm\ndt = 0 correspond to precession of the magnetization in the x-y plane at angular\nfrequency of about \u03b3(H \u2212 4\u03c0M mz ). Importantly, note\nthat a solution with magnetization antiparallel to the effective field (mz =-1) occurs for aI > \u03b1(H \u2212 4\u03c0M ) and\nm\u0302\ncorresponds to a static magnetization ( ddt\n= 0). Thus\n\nthe spin-torque, in this case, leads to a state of maximum magnetic energy of the free layer. Similar high energy states have also been observed in numerical studies\nfor the field in-plane geometry [19, 24]. As aI increases\nwith \u0398 the transition between a precessing state with\n|mz | < 1 and mz = \u22121 occurs rapidly with increasing\ncurrent and is hysteretic. For example, hysteresis occurs\nwhen, aI > \u03b1(H + 4\u03c0M ) for m\u0302 * m\u0302P = \u22121 while at the\nsame current aI < \u03b1(H \u2212 4\u03c0M ) when m\u0302 * m\u0302P = 1. In\naddition, for increasing applied field, the transition occurs at higher current and the width of the hysteresis\nincreases.\nFig. 2(b) shows the result of integration of the eqn.\n1 under the conditions approximating the experiment\n(P = 0.4 for Co and \u03b1 = 0.007 ([25])). The device resistance is plotted on a gray scale versus I and H and\nis computed from the angle between the fixed and free\nlayers using the analytic expression: Rnorm = (R(\u03b8) \u2212\nR(0))/(R(\u03c0) \u2212 R(0)) = (1 \u2212 cos2 (\u03b8/2))/(1 + cos2 (\u03b8/2))\n[20, 23, 26]. For H < 4\u03c0M (below the horizontal dashed\nline in the figure) the pinned layer magnetization tilts\ninto the plane and thus the pinned layer and effective field\nare no longer collinear. In this case, we find precessional\nstates of the magnetization, with the projection of m\u0302 on\nm\u0302P decreasing with increasing current. The average resistance is plotted below this line. The dashed-dotted\nline shows the transition to a lower resistance state for\ndecreasing currents, i.e., for states starting with the layers initially anti-aligned.\nQualitatively there is a good correspondence between\nthe experimental data and the model. The model captures the general features in the data, including the high\nfield region of increasing critical current with increasing applied field and the low field region (H < 1.4T ) in\nwhich the critical current increases with decreasing field.\nHowever, the model predicts significantly lower critical\ncurrents (factor of \u223c 5) and more hysteresis than that\nobserved in the experiment. The latter is perhaps not\nsurprising as we have assumed single domain dynamics\nin the model and likely the relaxation to the low energy\nmagnetic state occurs via non-uniform magnetic states of\nthe free layer.\nThe strongest evidence for current induced magnetization reversal at high fields comes from the experimental observation summarized in Fig. 3. Here we show\nMR measurements at fixed current bias. For low enough\ncurrents the spin-transfer torque cannot initiate magnetization dynamics, independent of the magnitude of the\napplied fields. An increase in magnetic field leads only\nto a more parallel alignment of the two layers. An example for this case is shown in Fig. 3(a). Here the bias\ncurrent I is below a threshold current It \u2248 26.6 mA. The\nfield dependence of the device resistance changes dramatically, once the bias current exceeds It [Fig. 3(b)].\nIn this case, one can distinguish between three distinct\nfield regions. The boundaries H1 , H2 and H3 of these\nthree regions depend on the current bias.

A further increase in current bias [Fig.\n3(c)] shows that at high enough currents the high field\ntransition from antiparallel to parallel alignment becomes\nhysteretic whereas the low field transition from parallel\nto antiparallel alignment remains reversible. The width\nof the hysteresis depends on the current bias and the polarity of the applied field. In general it increases with increasing current bias. This behavior is in sharp contrast\nto earlier reports [3, 6, 8]. In Ref. 8, when a high in-plane\nfield was applied to a pillar device, a large plateau in\nthe magnetoresistance with intermediate resistance Rint\nvalue (RAP > Rint > RP ) was observed. The resistance\nplateau was attributed to a precessing spin-wave state\nin-between P and AP alignment. From Fig. 3 it is clear\nthat in the field perpendicular geometry a large plateau\nin the magnetoresistance is absent. In comparison to\npoint contact experiments [3, 6, 18] high bias currents\nin pillar devices appear to lead to a complete magnetization reversal even at high magnetic fields. Our results\nthus suggest that the peak in dV/dI marks the reversal\nof the free layer, not the onset of magnetization dynamics. Of course, such DC measurements cannot rule out\nthe possibility of high field and current driven magnetic\nexcitations.\nIn summary, we have presented evidence for current\ninduced reversal in Co/Cu/Co pillar devices at high magnetic fields. In the field perpendicular geometry we have\nshown the existence of two distinct field regions at which\na transition between parallel and antiparallel alignment\ntakes place. In the low field region the magnetization reverses gradually to an antiparallel alignment through precessional states. In the high field region, at high enough\ncurrent bias, a hysteretic switching of the layers takes\nplace.\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge useful discussions\nwith S. Zhang, P. M. Levy and R.
