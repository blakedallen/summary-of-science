INTRODUCTION\n\nCold dark matter (CDM) halos are not smooth. Early\nnumerical simulations of the formation of CDM halos\nlacked sufficient resolution to detect much besides the\ngross features of the mass distribution (Davis et al. 1985;\nFrenk et al. 1985; Quinn et al. 1986; Efstathiou et al.\n1988; Frenk et al. 1988). Rapid advances in computational power and in the efficiency of codes have afforded\na dramatic reduction in the particle masses and gravitational softening lengths. Multi-mass techniques (e.g.\nKatz & White 1993; Bertschinger 2001) allow even further resolution increases in particular areas of interest.\nThe resulting high resolution maps of the matter distribution in CDM halos have revealed an astonishing abundance of substructure (Klypin et al. 1999; Moore et al.\n1999; Diemand et al. 2007a, hereafter paper I). In \"Via\nLactea\", the most recent and highest resolution CDM\nsimulation of a Galaxy scale halo to date, the total number of identifiable subhalos has reached \u223c 10, 000, which\ntogether account for 5.6% of the total host halo mass (paper I). Recent progress notwithstanding, the currently\nachievable mass resolution is orders of magnitude above\nthe true cutoff in the CDM fluctuation power spectrum,\nand given the observed scale-invariant nature of the subhalo mass function (dN/d ln M \u221d M \u22121 ), it is likely that\nthe total substructure abundance and mass fraction has\nnot yet converged.\nCDM halos are not round.\nWhereas analytical\nwork often treats CDM halos as spherically symmetric mass distributions, it has been known for some\ntime (Barnes & Efstathiou 1987; Efstathiou et al.\n1988; Frenk et al. 1988) that in general CDM halo\nshapes show significant departures from sphericality.\n\nThere is now a large body of work concerning the\nshapes of isolated CDM halos (Dubinski & Carlberg\n1991; Katz 1991; Warren et al. 1992; Dubinski 1994;\nJing et al. 1995; Tormen 1997; Thomas et al. 1998;\nBullock 2002; Jing & Suto 2002; Springel et al. 2004;\nBailin & Steinmetz 2005; Kasun & Evrard 2005;\nHopkins et al. 2005; Allgood et al. 2006; Bett et al.\n2007; Hayashi et al. 2007; Macci\u00f2 et al. 2007) and\nwidespread agreement on a number of findings: CDM\nhalos tend to be prolate, they are more spherical in their\nouter regions, more massive halos tend to have smaller\naxis ratios, the moment of inertia is aligned with the\nshape velocity anisotropy tensor, the smallest principal\naxis tends to line up with the angular momentum vector,\netc. (for a recent summary, see Allgood et al. 2006).\nWith Via Lactea's unprecedented resolution, we are\nnow for the first time able to extend this shape analysis\nto a well resolved subhalo population. This is interesting\nfrom a theoretical point of view, because of the important\nrole that tidal interactions play in shaping the properties\nof the subhalo population. The shapes of subhalos are\nlikely to be affected by tidal deformations, and a careful\nanalysis of the subhalo shapes might allow us to better\nunderstand the tidal interactions.\nKnowledge of subhalo shapes is important for several\ntypes of observational studies as well. Weak lensing is\nbecoming a very valuable tool for probing cosmological parameters (Brown et al. 2003; Bacon et al. 2003;\nHamana et al. 2003; Jarvis et al. 2003; Hoekstra et al.\n2006; Massey et al. 2007) and constraining density profiles of galaxy groups and clusters (Brainerd 2004;\nMandelbaum et al. 2006a). Any alignment between intrinsic galaxy ellipticity and with other galaxies or the\n\n\f2\n\nShapes of dark matter subhalos\n\nlocal mass density will introduce a bias into the lensing signal (Hirata & Seljak 2004; Bridle & King 2007).\nIn fact, Lee et al. (2005) found evidence for an intrinsic\nalignment, with subhalo minor axes preferentially perpendicular to the host halo's major axis, in a numerical simulation of four cluster scale halos, resolved with\n\u223c 2 \u00d7 106 particles each. They also developed an analytical model under the assumption that this alignment\nwas caused by the host halo's tidal field, and showed\nthat it reproduces the numerical findings well. Observational evidence for subhalo alignment has be found in the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), for galaxies in clusters\n(Agustsson & Brainerd 2006; Mandelbaum et al. 2006b)\nas well as in groups (Faltenbacher et al. 2007). Based\non N-body numerical experiments Ciotti & Dutta (1994)\nconcluded that the tidal field of a spherical cluster could\nbe responsible for the observed radial alignment of cluster galaxy isophotes. A better understanding of typical\nsubhalo shapes and their alignment within the host halo\nmight allow a statistical correction of the resulting bias.\nAnother observational arena dependent on subhalo\nshapes are stellar kinematical studies of Local Group\ndwarf galaxies, which are being used to constrain the\nmasses of their DM host halos (Wilkinson et al. 2004;\nLokas et al. 2005; Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2005; Walker et al. 2006;\nGilmore et al. 2007; Strigari et al. 2007). In almost all\ncases the analysis is performed assuming spherical symmetry and often also a constant velocity anisotropy.\nMore sophisticated analyses of the dwarf galaxy stellar\nmotions will benefit from firm theoretical expectations\nof the intrinsic DM subhalo shapes and should result in\nmore realistic models of the underlying DM mass distribution.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we\nbriefly outline the technique we employed to determine\nthe shape of subhalos. We present the shape parameters of the Via Lactea host halo in Section 3, and move\non in Section 4 to discuss the dependence of the subhalo's shape parameters on the radius at which they are\nmeasured, on their distance from the center of the host,\nand on the subhalo's mass. In Section 5 we present results concerning the spatial distribution of the subhalos\nwithin the host halo and the alignment of their ellipsoids\ntowards the host halo center. In Section 6 we consider the\nredshift evolution of the shapes of a sample of strongly\ntidally affected subhalos. Section 7 contains a discussion\nand summary of our results.\n2. SIMULATION AND SHAPE FINDING METHOD\n\nThe main sample of subhalos analyzed in this work\nstems from the z = 0 output of the \"Via Lactea\" simulation (paper I). This simulation follows the dark matter substructure of a Milky-Way-scale halo (M200 =\n1.77 \u00d7 1012 M\u2299 ) with 234 million particles. With a particle mass of \u2243 20, 000 M\u2299, the simulation resolves around\n10,000 subhalos within r200 = 388 kpc. The global z = 0\nproperties of the host halo and the substructure population was presented in paper I and the joint temporal evolution of host halo and substructure properties,\nwith an emphasis on tidal interactions, was discussed in\nDiemand et al. (2007b, hereafter paper II). Here we focus\non the shapes of the matter distribution in Via Lactea's\nhost halo and subhalo population.\nFor the determination of (sub)halo shapes we follow\n\nthe iterative technique outlined in Allgood et al. (2006).\nThis method is based on diagonalizing the weighted moment of inertia tensor\nX xi,n xj,n\n,\n(1)\nI \u0303ij =\nrn2\nn\nwhere\nrn =\n\np\nx2n + (yn /q)2 + (zn /s)2\n\n(2)\n\nis the ellipsoidal distance in the eigenvector coordinate\nsystem between the (sub)halo's center and the nth particle, and q = b/a and s = c/a are the intermediateto-major and minor-to-major axis ratios, respectively\n(a \u2265 b \u2265 c). Initially I \u0303ij is calculated for all particles\nwithin a spherical window of radius r0 . In subsequent\niterations we fix a = r0 and include only particles with\nrn < r0 . Iteration continues until q and s change by less\nthan 10\u22123 . The degree of triaxiality of a halo is quantified\nby the triaxiality parameter introduced by Franx et al.\n(1991)\n1 \u2212 q2\n.\n(3)\nT =\n1 \u2212 s2\nA halo is said to be oblate for T < 1/3, triaxial for\n1/3 < T < 2/3, and prolate for T > 2/3.\nFor comparison with observational data it is often more\ndesirable to constrain the shape of the potential than\nthe shape of the density distribution. The potential\nshape has the additional advantage that it is less sensitive\nto local density variations (from substructure for example) and is typically smooth and well approximated by\nconcentric ellipsoids (Springel et al. 2004; Hayashi et al.\n2007). Instead of measuring the potential shape directly,\nor by fitting ellipses to the intersections of isopotential\nsurfaces with three orthogonal planes (as advocated by\nSpringel et al. 2004), we diagonalize the unweighted kinetic energy tensor\n1X\nvi,n vj,n ,\n(4)\nKij =\n2 n\nwhere the vi,n are measured in the restframe of the subhalo under consideration.P Kij is related to the potential energy tensor Wij = xi d\u03a6/dxj through the tensor\nvirial theorem\n1 d2 Iij\n= 2Kij + Wij .\n2 dt2\n\n(5)\n\nThe internal structure of the Via Lactea host halo remains practically unchanged after z = 1.7 (paper II) and\nwe expect d2 Iij /dt2 = 0 at z = 0. In that case the eigenvectors of Kij should reflect the principal axes of the\npotential ellipsoid. Note that the assumption of a constant Iij is likely to fail for subhalos that are being tidally\nstripped, and in this case the principal axes of Kij will\nnot necessarily reflect the shape of the potential. Instead\nof the iterative procedure applied for Iij , we simply diagonalize Kij for all particles within the moment of inertia\nellipsoid at a given radius. In the following we will refer\nto shapes determined by diagonalization of Iij and Kij\nas the mass and potential shapes, respectively.\n3. HOST HALO SHAPE\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- The shape of the Via Lactea halo as a function of radius, derived from diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor Iij (top),\nand the velocity anisotropy tensor Kij as a proxy for the shape of the potential (bottom). The color indicates radius. The major principal\naxes at different radii are aligned to within 1\u25e6 , and the mass and potential shapes are aligned to within 5\u25e6 .\n\nAt the present epoch the Via Lactea host halo is prolate. We have determined the principal components of\nIij and Kij as a function of major axis radius. The resulting shape ellipsoids are depicted in Fig. 1. Neither\nthe shape nor the orientation of the ellipsoids vary much\nout to r200 . As a function of radius the major axis eigenvectors for both mass and potential shape are aligned\nto within 1\u25e6 . As expected the potential is significantly\nrounder than the mass distribution, and the major axes\nof the two are aligned to within 5\u25e6 at all radii. In Fig. 2\nwe plot mass and potential shape parameters q and s and\ntriaxiality parameter T at z =0, 0.5, and 1 as a function\nof radius. Recall (from paper II, Figs. 3 and 4) that the\nspherically averaged mass distribution of the Via Lactea\nhost halo remains remarkably constant in proper coordinates after the last major merger at z = 1.7 until today.\nWe now see, however, that the host halo does undergo\nsome adjustments in its shape.\nAt z = 0 the mass distribution becomes slightly less\nspherical towards the center with axis ratios dropping\nfrom \u223c 0.55 at 200 kpc < r < r200 to \u223c 0.45 at 20 kpc,\n\nwhereas the potential shape axis ratios remains constant\nat around 0.8. The triaxiality parameter remains firmly\nin the prolate regime (> 2/3) for both mass and potential throughout the entire halo. The potential shape becomes slightly more prolate in the inner regions. At earlier times, however, we detect some significant changes in\nthe axis ratios, especially in the outer regions. At z = 0.5\nboth q and s are larger by about 0.1-0.15 beyond 100\nkpc, and at z = 1 q is significantly larger than s, resulting in a triaxial, as opposed to prolate, outer region beyond \u223c 200 kpc. The potential shape exhibits variations\nof comparable magnitude. Note that the host halo accretes some fairly massive subhalos (Msub /Mhost \u223c 0.1)\nbetween z = 1 and z = 0.5. Dynamical friction causes\nthese subhalos to spiral in to the center over a few orbits,\nand they lose most of their mass (> 99%) in this process.\nThe associated redistribution of material probably contributes to the observed shape adjustments.\nThe shape of the Via Lactea host halo is consistent\nwith previous studies of the shapes of dark matter halos,\nwhich have generally found them to be mostly prolate\n\n\f4\n\nShapes of dark matter subhalos\n\nFig. 2.- Host halo shape parameters for the mass distribution\n(top panel ) and the potential (bottom panel ) as a function of proper\ndistance from the halo center at z = 0 (solid lines), z = 0.5 (dashed\nlines), and z = 1 (dotted lines).

Observational studies of the shape of the Milky Way galaxy,\nhowever, have been much less conclusive. Disk warping\n(Olling & Merrifield 2000) and some models of the Sagittarius tidal stream (Ibata et al. 2001; Majewski et al.\n2003; Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Delgado et al. 2004) suggest that the\nMilky Way halo is close to spherical (q \u2248 s & 0.8) and\noblate, whereas some studies of the leading arm of the\nSagittarius stream favor a prolate shape with s = 0.6\n(Helmi 2004; Law et al. 2005).\nThe collisionless nature of our Via Lactea simulation prohibits a direct comparison between our findings and the observational constraints on the shape\nof the Milky Way host halo.\nPrevious hydrodynamical numerical studies of galaxy formation have\nfound that the cooling of baryons leads to significantly\nrounder halos (Kazantzidis et al. 2004; Springel et al.\n2004; Bailin & Steinmetz 2005), especially in the central\nregions where s can increase by as much as 0.2 to 0.3. At\nthe moment it is unclear how much of this effect is due\nto a potential overcooling problem in these simulations.\n4. SUBHALO SHAPES\n\nWe now turn to the analysis of the shapes of Via\nLactea's subhalos. Unlike the host halo, which is resolved by over ten million particles even within 0.1r200 ,\nthe subhalo shape determination is limited by numerical\nresolution. We restrict our analysis to halos containing\nat least 5,000 particles within their tidal radius, rt . As\nin paper I, we define rt as the point where the subhalo's\n\nspherically averaged density profile drops to twice the\nlocal underlying matter density. Via Lactea contains 97\nsuch halos within r200 , 309 within 3r200 , and 829 in total.\nOne complication arises from the difficulty in distinguishing between actual subhalo particles and those belonging to the underlying host halo. Our subhalo finder\n(6DFOF, cf. paper I) assigns all particles within the\ntidal radius to the subhalo, without removing unbound\nparticles. Some contribution to Iij and Kij would thus\ncome from background particles. This contribution is\ngenerally negligible for Iij , since the background particles are more or less uniformly distributed throughout\nthe subhalo. The host halo particles, however, significantly distort Kij , because their velocities are typically\nmuch larger and more anisotropic than the subhalo particle velocities, especially for subhalos close to the host\nhalo center. For this reason we have cleaned the subhalos from background host halo particles by comparing\nthe members of each subhalo to those of its progenitor in\nthe penultimate simulation output at z = 0.005 (\u223c 68.5\nMyr before z = 0), and retained only those particles\nthat also appear within rt at the earlier time. This effectively removes all host halo particles from the subhalo\nand allows an accurate determination of Kij . We have\nconfirmed that the shape of Iij is not affected by this\ncleaning procedure.\nThe subhalo tidal radius shrinks as subhalos pass\nthrough the inner regions of the host halo due to the\nincreasing background density. However, as we showed\nin paper II, not all particles beyond this reduced rt are\nactually stripped from the subhalo, and rt re-expands\nas the subhalo begins its climb out of the host halo potential. Measuring the shape for all particles within the\ntidal radius thus probes more central regions for subhalos closer to the halo center than for subhalos in the\nouter regions. To avoid this bias we focus on the subhalo\nshapes for all particles within the radius of the peak of\nthe circular velocity curve, rVmax . This choice comes at\nthe cost of a reduced number of particles, but rVmax does\nnot temporarily decrease at pericenter passage.\n4.1. Shape vs. Radius\nWe first discuss the dependence of subhalo shape on\nthe radius at which they are measured, see Fig. 3. For\nthis analysis we included the complete sample of 829 halos with more than 5000 particles within their tidal radius. Most of these halos currently lie outside of r200 ,\nbut a significant fraction (78% within 2r200 ) have passed\nthrough the host halo at some earlier time (paper II)\nand have experienced tidal interactions. Similarly to the\nVia Lactea host halo, we find that the subhalos' mass\ndistributions become slightly less spherical in the inner\nregions; hqi decreases from about 0.87 at 3rVmax to 0.68\nat 0.2rVmax , the innermost point at which we determine\nsubhalo shapes. Similarly, hsi decreases from 0.72 to\nabout 0.45. The 68% scatter is about 0.2 for both q and s.\nAs expected the potential shape shows even less dependence on radius and is almost spherical, with hqi \u2248 0.9\nand hsi \u2248 0.85. The potential axis parameters also have\na smaller 68% scatter of about 0.1.\nUnlike isolated dark matter halos, which tend to be\nprolate, we find that subhalos are generally triaxial. hT i\nshows a slight decreasing trend with radius, but remains\nin the triaxial regime for both mass and potential shape\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 3.- Mean (sub)halo shape parameters vs. the major axis radius of the ellipsoidal window used in the shape determination. We\nplot the shape of the moment of inertia tensor Iij (solid lines, filled\nsymbols) and the shape of the kinetic energy tensor Kij (dashed\nlines, open symbols). The 68% scatter around the mean is indicated by the shaded region for Iij and by the thin dashed lines\nfor Kij . Top panel : intermediate to major axis ratio, q = b/a.\nMiddle panel : minor to major axis ratio s = c/a. Bottom panel :\ntriaxiality parameter, T = (1 \u2212 q 2 )/(1 \u2212 s2 ).\n\nFig. 4.- Mean (sub)halo shape parameters measured within\nrVmax as a function of distance from the halo center. In addition\nto the mass shape (solid lines, filled circles) and the potential\nshape (dashed lines, open circles), in the top two panels we also\nplot the shape parameters measured within rt (dash-dotted lines,\nopen triangles). The thin solid line indicates r200 = 388 kpc.\n\nthroughout the range of radii that we probed. Note that\nthe 68% scatter around hT i extends into both the prolate\nand oblate regime. At rVmax about 25% of all (sub)halos\nare prolate and an equal number oblate.\n\nfect, and indeed, when we look at the trend vs. distance\nfor shapes measured within rt (dashed lines and open triangles in Fig. 4) we find that for the innermost bin the\nmean axis ratios decrease. At least part of this trend,\nhowever, may also be explained by the temporary decrease of rt as the subhalo passes through pericenter and\nthe shape-radius dependence discussed in Section 4.1.\n\n4.2. Shape vs. Distance\n\n4.3. Shape vs. Vmax\n\nNext we take a look at the dependence of subhalo\nshapes on the distance from the halo center. For this\npurpose we use the shapes determined from all particles\nwithin rVmax . Fig. 4 shows that the shape of the mass\ndistribution is close to independent of distance, with a\nweak but significant trend towards slightly larger axis ratios closer to the host halo center. Within r200 the mean\naxis ratios are hqi = 0.87 and hsi = 0.74, and outside\nof r200 they are hqi = 0.81 and hsi = 0.64. The potential shape is independent of distance, with hqi = 0.93,\nhsi = 0.86. The ellipsoids remains predominantly triaxial over the whole range of distance, for both mass and\npotential.\nOne might have expected a stronger distance dependence, since the subhalo shapes are affected by tidal interactions, which are stronger at the center. This is likely\na consequence of measuring the shapes within rVmax ,\nwhich is deep inside the halo mass distribution, and\nnot as strongly affected by tides. Measuring the shapes\nwithin the tidal radius should give a more pronounced ef-\n\nLastly, we consider the shape parameters as a function\nof the subhalo's Vmax , a proxy for mass, Fig. 5. Again we\nuse all 829 (sub)halos in the simulation. (Allgood et al.\n2006) found that the axis ratios of isolated field halos\nmeasured at 0.3rvir decreased with increasing halo mass,\ni.e. less massive halos are more spherical. In contrast,\nwe find no such trend for subhalos. With the exception\nof the highest mass bin, both q and s appear to be independent of Vmax .\nThe highest Vmax bin (centered on 35 km s\u22121 , corresponding to a tidal mass of \u223c 1010 M\u2299 ) has hsi =\n0.57 \u00b1 0.05, a bit less than would be expected from an\nextrapolation of the Allgood et al. (2006) hsi \u2212 Mhalo\nrelation which gives hsi \u2248 0.69 \u00b1 0.04 at 1010 M\u2299 for\n\u03c38 = 0.74. All but one of the six halos in this bin lie\nwithin 2r200 and can thus be considered subhalos. In\nAllgood et al. (2006) shapes were measured at 0.3rvir ,\nwhereas our subhalo shapes are measured at rVmax . We\nfind it difficult to assign a \"virial\" radius to subhalos (paper II), and instead use the tidal radius rt as the outer\n\n\f6\n\nShapes of dark matter subhalos\nTABLE 1\nThe 3D spatial distribution of subhalos\nNh\nq\ns\n\u03b8a\n\u03b8b\n\u03b8c\nhost halo\n\u2013\n0.58 0.55\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\nM > 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299\n5404 0.66 0.54 10.1 36.2 34.7\nVmax > 5 km s\u22121\n1571 0.68 0.58 13.5 20.1 15.9\nVmax,p > 5 km s\u22121\n3824 0.64 0.59 8.36 15.1 12.8\nVmax,p > 10 km s\u22121\n689\n0.65 0.55 5.90 7.70 5.09\nVmax,p > 15 km s\u22121\n224\n0.64 0.52 10.6 3.13 10.9\ntop 100 Vmax,p\n100\n0.61 0.41 10.6 9.55 12.9\ntop 500 Vmax,p\n500\n0.67 0.54 4.47 4.42 2.91\ntop 1000 Vmax,p\n1000 0.64 0.57 4.10 9.02 9.63\nNote. - The shapes of the subhalo spatial distribution for\ndifferent subhalo samples (described in the text).

Panels and symbols as in\nFig. 4.\n\n\"edge\" of the subhalo. The median ratio of rVmax to rt\nin this bin is 0.16, and for a 1010 M\u2299 field halo with a\nconcentration of 15 rVmax /rvir = 2.163/c = 0.14, so it is\nlikely that we are simply measuring the shapes farther\nin, where axis ratios tend to be smaller (see Fig. 3). For\ncomparison, hsi = 0.70 when measured at rt .\nAt any rate, our mean subhalo axis ratios become independent of mass at lower Vmax . It is possible that tidal\ninteractions cause this flattening of the subhalo shapemass relationship. Another possibility is that halo shapes\n(for both subhalos and field halos) are in fact intrinsically\nindependent of mass when measured at a fixed physical\nscale, such as rVmax . In this case the mass dependence\nfound at 0.3rvir would in effect just be combination of\nradius dependence and the halo mass \u2013 concentration\nrelation: 0.3rvir is smaller than rVmax in massive, low\nconcentration halos. This means that relative to rVmax ,\nthe shapes of more massive halos are probed at smaller\nradii, where axis ratios tend to be smaller. Note that\nin this picture also the redshift dependence observed by\nAllgood et al. (2006) might in part be a consequence of a\nwindow (0.3rvir ) which becomes larger with time due to\nits co-moving definition. Further investigations will be\nnecessary to fully address this issue.\n5. SUBHALO DISTRIBUTION AND SHAPE ALIGNMENT\n\nHaving discussed the dependence of subhalo shapes on\ntheir properties, we now consider the spatial distribution\nand alignment within the host halo.\n5.1. Spatial Distribution\n\nThe spatial distribution of subhalos depends sensitively on the sample selection criterion. In paper II\nwe showed that the z = 0 distribution of Via Lactea\nsubhalos is anti-biased compared to the mass distribution of the host halo. For subhalos selected to have a\nz = 0 mass greater than 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 , the ratio of subhalo number density to host halo mass density is simply proportional to radius, whereas for subhalos selected\nto have a z = 0 Vmax greater than 5 km s\u22121 , this ratio scales as the enclosed mass. Previous studies have\nfound that when subhalos are selected by their mass\nor Vmax at the time of accretion, this bias is substantially reduced, and the resulting subhalo number density\nprofile more closely traces the underlying mass distribution (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Faltenbacher & Diemand\n2006).\nHere we extend this analysis to a full 3D spatial distribution of the subhalos. In addition to the two samples\nconsidered in paper II, we include a range of samples selected by the highest Vmax a subhalo reaches throughout\nits lifetime, a quantity we refer to as 'Vmax,p '. Three of\nthese samples are defined by lower limits, Vmax,p > 5,\n10, and 15 km s\u22121 , and three more by including the 100,\n500, 1000 subhalos with the largest Vmax,p . This type\nof selection is designed to remove the bias introduced by\ntidal interactions, since the selection is performed on subhalo properties prior to their interaction with the host.\nFor each sample of subhalos we diagonalize a weighted\n\"moment of inertia\" tensor (Eq.1) constructed from the\nz = 0 positions of the subhalos, without regard for their\nmasses. We then calculate the axis ratios of the resulting ellipsoids and the angles between their principal axes\nand the principal axes of the host halo's mass distribution measured at r200 .\nThe spatial distribution of all subhalo samples is triaxial, with s comparable to the underlying host halo\ndensity distribution and slightly larger q. Not all of\nthe ellipsoids, however, are aligned with the host halo.\nThe major axis of the ellipsoid defined by all subhalos\nwith Mt > 4 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 (Vmax > 5 km s\u22121 ) is tilted by\n10.1\u25e6 (13.5\u25e6 ) with respect to the host halo's major axis.\nIn general, the subhalo samples selected by Vmax,p are\nmore closely aligned with the host halo. The best alignment is found for the sample consisting of the 500 subhalos with the largest Vmax,p , whose principal axes are\ntilted by less than 5\u25e6 from the host halo's. The results\nfor all samples are summarized in Table 1. Note that\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 7.- The distribution of the cosine of the angle between the\ndirection towards the halo center and the subhalos' major (solid\nlines), intermediate (dotted lines), and minor (dashed lines) axis,\nfor all subhalos within r200 . The data points indicate the fraction\nof subhalos within each bin of width 0.1. Top panel : 97 Via Lactea\nsubhalos within r200 . Middle panel : 520 Via Lactea subhalos outside of r200 . Bottom panel : 69 \"D12\" cluster subhalos within rvir .\nThe intermediate and minor axis data points have been offset by\n\u00b10.01 in the horizontal direction for clarity.\n\nFig. 6.- The ratio of the subhalo number density nsub (re ) to\nthe host\np halo mass density \u03c1(re ) as a function of ellipsoidal radius,\nre = (x\u2032 )2 + (y \u2032 /q)2 + (z \u2032 /s)2 . The ratio has been normalized\nto unity at re = r200 . The solid line indicates nsub /\u03c1 \u221d r and the\ndotted line nsub /\u03c1 \u221d M (< r).\n\nZentner et al. (2005), Libeskind et al. (2005, 2007), and\nKang et al. (2007) also find that the substructure distribution is well aligned with the host halo orientation.\nThe radial dependence of the subhalo number density\nis presented in Fig. 6, where we plot the ratio of the\nsubhalo number density to the host halo's mass density\nas a function of re , the ellipsoidal radius (2). The ratio\nhas been normalized to unity at re = r200 , in order to\nhighlight the radial dependence in the interior of the host\nhalo. The top panel clearly shows the radial dependence\npublished in paper II hold also for ellipsoidal binning:\nsubhalo samples selected according to their present mass\nor Vmax are anti-biased with respect to the host halo\nmass distribution, with the former scaling as nsub /\u03c1 \u221d r\ndown to \u223c 60 kpc and the latter as nsub /\u03c1 \u221d M (< r)\nfor the entire range of radii probed. The bottom panel\nshows that a selection based on Vmax,p removes a lot of\nthis anti-bias. All six samples have a radial number density dependence closer to the host halo mass distribution\nthan the samples selected according to z = 0 properties.\nThe more restrictive the selection criterion is, the larger\nnsub /\u03c1 becomes. For some of the selections the ratio even\nexceeds unity from 80 kpc to r200 , indicating that these\n\nsamples are spatially biased with respect to the host halo,\ni.e. their abundances falls off with radius faster than the\nunderlying density distribution. This bias is probably a\nconsequence of dynamical friction. The subhalos with\nthe largest Vmax,p were massive enough to experience\nsome degree of dynamical friction and spiraled in towards\nthe center. Along the way they lost mass, reducing the\ndynamical friction and preventing them from completely\nmerging with the host. This process would preferentially\nremove such subhalos from the outer regions.\nThe \"top 500 Vmax,p \" sample comes closest to tracing\n\u03c1(r) (both in radial dependence and in the orientation\nof the shape ellipsoid), and we have plotted it in the top\npanel for direct comparison with the samples discussed\nin paper II. The decrease in nsub /\u03c1 below re = 70 kpc is\nprobably at least partially due to numerical resolution,\nsince the decrease is smaller for larger, and therefore better resolved subhalos.\n5.2. Radial Alignment\nVia Lactea's very high numerical resolution allows us\nto investigate the orientation of dark matter subhalos\nwith respect to the host halo center. We find strong\nevidence for preferential radial alignment of the subhalo\ntriaxial mass distribution.\nIn the top panel of Fig. 7 we plot the distribution of\n| cos \u03b8|, the absolute value of the cosine of the angle between each of the principal axes of the subhalo's triaxial\nellipsoid and the radius vector from the host halo center,\nfor the 97 Via Lactea subhalos within r200 . If the subhalo\nellipsoids were randomly distributed with respect to the\nhalo center, this distribution would be flat. Instead we\n\n\f8\n\nShapes of dark matter subhalos\nh| cos \u03b8|i and f (| cos \u03b8| > 0.8) decrease monotonically towards smaller r/rt . The mean tidal radius for the 97 subhalos in this sample is hrt i = 10.6 kpc, and hrVmax i =2.31\nkpc. Not surprisingly, the alignment signal is less pronounced when shapes are measured at rVmax . However,\neven in this case the alignment\np is significant: h| cos \u03b8|i =\n0.58 with an uncertainty (= var(| cos \u03b8|)/Nsub ) of 0.03,\nwhich corresponds to a \u223c 2.5\u03c3 significance.\nNote that while Lee et al. (2005) finds that the subhalo minor axes are preferentially perpendicular to the\nhost halo's major axis in a study of cluster-scale subhalos, and Faltenbacher et al. (2007, in preparation) find a\nsimilar but weaker alignment signal in group-scale subhalos, we find no evidence for such an alignment in the\nVia Lactea subhalo population. The minor axes of our\nsubhalo population shows no correlation with any of the\nhost halo's principal axes.\n6. REDSHIFT EVOLUTION\n\nFig. 8.- The dependence of the subhalo alignment towards the\nhost halo center as function of subhalo radius at which the shape\nis measured. Only subhalos within r200 have been included. Solid\nline: the mean of | cos \u03b8| and its uncertainty. Dotted line: the\nfraction of subhalos with | cos \u03b8| > 0.8 and its Poisson errors. Radii\nas a fraction of rt (filled circles, lower axis) and as a fraction of\nrVmax (open squares, upper axis).\n\nsee that the major axis distribution is strongly peaked\ntowards large values of | cos \u03b8|, indicating that the major\naxis preferentially points towards the halo center. Correspondingly, the intermediate and minor axes are biased\ntowards low values of | cos \u03b8|.\nIn the middle panel of Fig. 7 we plot the same distribution for all halos outside of 3r200 . The distribution\nis flat, showing no evidence for alignment of any of the\nprincipal axes. The alignment effect appears to only be\npresent for subhalos physically associated with the Via\nLactea host halo, and this is one piece of evidence for a\ntidal origin of this radial alignment.\nFor comparison we have plotted (lower panel Fig. 7)\nthe same distribution for the subhalos of a galaxy\ncluster scale dark matter halo, the 14 million particle \"D12\" cluster discussed in Diemand et al. (2004).\nThe same subhalo shape alignment is present here too.\nRagone-Figueroa & Plionis (2007) and Faltenbacher et\nal. (2007, in preparation) also observe such an alignment in a much larger sample of lower resolution group\nand cluster scale dark matter halos and their subhalo\npopulation.\nIf tidal interactions are indeed responsible for the radial alignment, then it may be expected that the alignment would be more pronounced in the outer regions of\nthe subhalo, where tidal effects are strongest. Indeed\nwe observe just such a trend when we look at the mean\nof | cos \u03b8| and f (| cos \u03b8| > 0.8), the fraction of subhalos\nwith | cos \u03b8| > 0.8, versus subhalo radius, see Fig. 8. For\nthis analysis we restrict ourselves to subhalos within r200 ,\nand consider radii as a fraction of both rt and rVmax .\nWhen measured at rt , about 55% of all subhalos have\na major axis that is aligned to within 35\u25e6 of the direction towards the halo center and h| cos \u03b8|i = 0.75. Both\n\nThe fact that the radial subhalo alignment is stronger\nfor subhalos closer to the host halo center (see Fig. 7)\nand that the alignment signal is more pronounced when\nthe shapes are measured in the outer regions of the subhalo (see Fig. 8) is suggestive of a a tidal origin of the\nalignment. In this section we present additional support\nfor this hypothesis by looking at the temporal evolution\nof the shapes and orientations of a small sample of subhalos, chosen according to the following criteria:\ni) the subhalos must lie within r200 at z = 0,\nii) they must have undergone at least three pericenter\npassages since z = 1.7,\niii) they must have experienced significant tidal mass\nloss, \u2206M/M = 1.0 \u2212 Mt (z = 0)/Mt (z = 1.7) > 0.4,\nand\niv) they must contain more than 4000 particles at z = 0\n(Mt (z = 0) > 8 \u00d7 107 M\u2299 ).\nThese constraints result in a sample of 19 well resolved\nsubhalos that have experienced significant tidal interactions with the host halo.\nIn Fig. 9 we show the temporal evolution of hqi, hsi,\nand hVmax i for this subsample. The hVmax i curve shows\nthat these subhalos experience most of their mass growth\nearly on and then continually lose mass due to tidal interactions with the host halo (see paper II for a more\nextensive discussion). Here we show that this tidal interaction also leads to subhalos becoming rounder with\ntime. At formation they have hqi \u2248 0.65 and hsi \u2248 0.5,\nbut these grow as they are captured and begin to feel\nthe host halo's tidal field. After z = 1 hqi remains stable\nat about 0.9, but hsi is still increasing slightly, reaching\n\u223c 0.85 at z = 0. For comparison we also show the z = 0\nmean axis ratios of the 520 halos outside of 3r200 . Owing to their large distance from the host halo, these halos\nhave experienced weaker tidal interactions. As expected\nthese halos are less spherical than the tidally stripped\nsample: hqi = 0.85 and hsi = 0.72. This further supports\nthe notion that tidal interactions tend to make subhalos\nrounder.\nIn the following we further restrict our sample, and\nlook in more detail at the orbits of individual subhalos\n\n\f9\nTABLE 2\nSubhalo properties of the shape evolution subsample\nSubhalo\nId\n04242\n10876\n13351\n13467\n18412\n21500\n\nFig. 9.- hqi (solid line, red), hsi (dotted line, blue), and hVmax i\n(dashed line, green) for the 19 subhalo sample (see text for a discussion of their selection) as a function of time. The two filled\ncircles at z = 0 indicate hqi and hsi for all halos beyond 3r200 ,\nwhich have been less affected by tides from the host halo. The\nshapes are determined within rt .\n\nand the time dependence of their shapes and alignments.\nFor this purpose we hand selected five illustrative examples of subhalos with small pericenters ranging from 9.6\nto 32 kpc. For comparison we also included one subhalo\n(Id #21500) with a higher angular momentum orbit and\na pericenter of 69 kpc. The properties of the selected\nsubhalos are summarized in Table 2.\nIn Fig. 10 we present a three-dimensional visualization\nof the orbits for the six subhalos in this sample. Starting\nwith the z = 0 output and for every fourth output thereafter (corresponding to a time interval of 274 Myr) up to\nz = 2, we have plotted at the subhalo's center of mass location an ellipsoid whose orientation and axis ratios are\ndetermined from all particles within the subhalo's tidal\nradius. The major axis of each ellipsoid is indicated by\na short solid line. For clarity we used a fixed major axis\nlength of 10 kpc, although the tidal radii vary along the\norbit. The orbits are shown in proper coordinates in the\nrest frame of the host halo and the sides of the box range\nfrom -300 to +300 kpc.\nThe most striking feature of these plots is that the\nradial alignment of the subhalo is preserved throughout\nthe majority of its orbit. The subhalos' ellipsoids perform\na near perfect figure rotation such that the major axis\ncontinually points close to the host halo's center. This\nfigure rotation, however, is not seen in subhalo #21500,\nthe one with the higher angular momentum orbit. Its\norientation is almost independent of its orbital position.\nWe have quantified these trends in Fig. 11, where we\nplot each subhalo's radius, its axis ratios q and s, and its\n| cos \u03b8| as a function of time. The evolution of q and s\nvery closely tracks the orbit of the subhalo. Every time\na subhalo passes through pericenter its axis ratios decrease. Note that part of this decrease can be attributed\nto the fact that the tidal radii shrink during pericenter\npassage, and so we are effectively measuring the subhalo\nshapes further in, where they are intrinsically less spher-\n\nz=0\nMt\nVmax\n( M\u2299 )\n( km s\u22121 )\n2.4 \u00d7 108\n15.4\n1.6 \u00d7 108\n14.6\n4.4 \u00d7 108\n18.8\n1.2 \u00d7 108\n14.3\n1.3 \u00d7 108\n12.5\n8.4 \u00d7 107\n11.9\n\nz = 1.7\nMt\nVmax\n(M\u2299 )\n( km s\u22121 )\n3.7 \u00d7 109\n28.2\n4.6 \u00d7 108\n18.8\n2.6 \u00d7 109\n66.9\n2.8 \u00d7 109\n28.6\n4.0 \u00d7 109\n32.5\n1.5 \u00d7 108\n13.4\n\n\u2206M/M\n0.93\n0.66\n0.84\n0.96\n0.97\n0.45\n\nical (see Section 4.1). However, rt drops below rVmax\nonly for one or two outputs close to pericenter, and for\nmost of the orbit remains in the regime where the axis\nratios are almost independent of radius. Thus we conclude that the temporary decrease in rt at pericenter is\nnot sufficient to explain the full extent of the correlation\nbetween axis ratios and orbital position. Furthermore we\nsee from the plot of | cos \u03b8| that the subhalos are indeed\npointing close to the host halo center for the majority of\ntheir orbits. During the fast pericenter passages | cos \u03b8|\ndrops significantly, but remains close to unity almost everywhere else. There are a few exceptions, where | cos \u03b8|\ndrops below unity even away from pericenter, for example at z = 0.7 for #04242 and at z = 0.4 for #10876\nand #13467, and these are most likely caused by close\npassages to other massive subhalos.\nTogether these trends provide strong evidence for a\ntidal origin of the radial alignment of subhalos. As they\norbit the host halo's center of mass, tidal forces continually distort the subhalos' mass distribution, stretching\nthem along the radial direction and compressing them\nin the perpendicular directions. This tidal distortion is\nstronger the closer the subhalo gets to the host halo center, but the pericenter passage occurs so quickly that the\nsubhalo does not have enough time to adjust its orientation to point towards the center.\nOur subsample, of course, was chosen to have experienced strong tidal interactions by requiring \u2206M/M >\n0.4 and at least 3 pericenter passages. However, as we\nshowed in paper II, more than half of all subhalos lose\nmore than 50% of their mass from z = 1 to z = 0, and\nso tidally caused radial alignment is expected for most\nsubhalos. As mentioned above, subhalo #21500 is one\nexample of a subhalo that does not appear to experience\nmuch radial alignment. We found that of the 19 subhalos\nfor which we performed a time dependent analysis, only\nthree subhalos exhibit a similar lack of alignment-orbit\ncorrelation.\n7. CONCLUSION\n\nThe main conclusions of this paper can be summarized\nin the following points.\n\u2022 The shape of the Via Lactea host halo is prolate,\nand slightly less spherical (lower axis ratios) in\nthe central regions. The shape of the potential\n(q \u2248 s \u2248 0.8) is significantly rounder than the mass\ndistribution (q \u2248 s \u2248 0.4 \u2212 0.55).\n\u2022 Whereas isolated halos tend to be prolate, we find\nthat subhalos are predominantly triaxial. Overall subhalos are more spherical than the host halo.\n\n\f10\n\nShapes of dark matter subhalos\n\nFig. 10.- The proper space orbits and shapes of six subhalos (see text for a discussion of their selection) as function of time. Colors\nindicate the distance in proper kpc from the host halo center, which is indicated by the red icosahedron. The symbols depict ellipsoids of\na constant size (major principal axis of 10 kpc) whose axis ratios and orientations are determined from all particles within the subhalo's\ntidal radius. Ellipsoids are plotted for outputs between z = 2 and z = 0 with a stride of 4 outputs, corresponding to a time interval of 274\nMyr. The\naxes hqi\nare =\nindicated\nby short\nlines.\nrandom. The major principal axis of the subhalo\nThemajor\nmassprincipal\nshape has\n0.83 and\nhsi =solid\n0.68,\nav-\n\neraged over all subhalos within 3r200 . The potential shape for these subhalos is very close to spherical, with hqi = 0.93 and hsi = 0.86. Like isolated\nhalos, subhalos tend to be slightly less spherical in\nthe central regions.\n\nmass distribution tends to align with the direction\ntowards the halo center. This alignment disappears for subhalos beyond \u223c 3r200 and is more pronounced when the shape is measured in the outer\nregions of the subhalo.\n\n\u2022 We find a weak trend towards larger axis ratios\nfor subhalos closer to the host halo center. Within\nr200 hqi = 0.87 and hsi = 0.74, compared with\nhqi = 0.82 and hsi = 0.65 for all subhalos outside\nof r200 .\n\n\u2022 Tidal interactions with the host halo tend to make\nthe subhalos rounder over time.\n\n\u2022 For subhalos with Vmax < 30 km s\u22121 the axis ratios\nare independent of Vmax . At higher Vmax they are\nslightly lower.\n\u2022 The spatial distribution of subhalos matches the\nprolate shape of the host halo when subhalos are\nselected by Vmax,p , the largest Vmax they ever had\nduring their lifetime. This type of selection also\nresults in an ellipsoidal radius dependence of the\nsubhalo abundance that more closely follows the\nmass distribution of the host halo than the antibiased distributions from selections based on z = 0\nsubhalo properties like Mt and Vmax .\n\u2022 The orientation of subhalo shape ellipsoids is not\n\n\u2022 For the majority of subhalos whose temporal evolution we studied here in detail, the radial alignment\nis preserved during the subhalo's orbit, and the axis\nratios decrease during pericenter passage. We conclude that the radial subhalo alignment is likely\ncaused by tidal interactions with the host halo.\n\nSupport for this work was provided by NASA grants\nNAG5-11513 and NNG04GK85G.
