The hot\nbig bang cosmology is an extremely successful theory.\nIt explains the existence of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and its thermal nature, the observed expansion of the universe, the abundance of light elements\nand the astrophysical fits for the age of the universe.\nHowever, it leaves without answer why our universe appears so homogeneous and nearly flat at large scales. Inflation offers a natural answer to these questions and, at\nthe same time, provides a predictive mechanism to account for the small observed inhomogeneities [2] responsible for the structure formation in the universe and the\nanisotropies present in the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB), as first detected by the COBE satellite and further analyzed by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe (WMAP) satellite [3]. Inflation predicts production of primordial density perturbations and relic gravitational waves as amplifications of vacuum fluctuations\ntogether with a quantum-to-classical transition at the\nscale of Hubble sphere crossing. Primordial perturbations leave an imprint in the CMB anisotropies, which\nare, therefore, of major importance for understanding\nour universe and its origin. The potential-energy density of a scalar (inflaton) field is assumed to cause the\ninflationary expansion, and the amplification of its quantum fluctuations and those of the metric are inevitable\nconsequences in an expanding universe [4]. The metric\nfluctuations provide the initial conditions for the acoustic\noscillations of the plasma at the onset of the subsequent\nradiation-dominated epoch. The detection of the effects\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress:\naddress:\n\u2021 Electronic address:\n\u00a7 Electronic address:\n\u2020 Electronic\n\nivan.agullo@uv.es\njnavarro@ific.uv.es\nolmo@iem.cfmac.csic.es\nleonard@uwm.edu\n\nof primordial gravitational waves in future high-precision\nmeasurements of the CMB anisotropies, as for instance in\nthe PLANCK satellite mission [5], will serve as a highly\nnon-trivial test for inflation. Therefore, it is particularly\nimportant to scrutinize, from all points of view, the standard predictions of inflation (as summarized for instance,\nin [6]) to be tested empirically. This is the aim of this paper. We point out that if quantum field renormalization\nis taken into account, as in the experimentally tested\nCasimir effect, the quantitative predictions of inflation\nchange significantly, and may be tested in forthcoming\nCMB measurements.\nThe scalar perturbations, which constitute the \"seeds\"\nfor structure formation, are characterized by the power\nspectrum\n\nPR (k) =\n\n\u0012\n\nH\n\u03c6\u0307\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\nH\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6 represents the inflaton scalar field, which dominates the energy density during inflation. Here H stands\nfor the Hubble rate H \u2261 \u0227/a, where a(t) is the expansion factor and dot means derivative with respect\nto the comoving time. The above expression is evaluated at the Hubble radius crossing time tk (usually\ncalled \"horizon crossing\" time), where k/a(tk ) = H. In\nthe typical slow-roll inflationary scenario the homogeneous part of the inflaton field \u03c60 (t) rolls slowly down\nits potential\nV (\u03c6) towards a minimum. Both \u03c6 and\nq\n\n8\u03c0G\nH \u2261\n3 V (\u03c60 ) are changing very gradually and this\nchange is parameterized by the slow-roll parameters \u01eb, \u03b7,\nwhere \u01eb \u2261 \u2212\u1e22/H 2 , and \u03b7 \u2212 \u01eb \u2261 \u03c6\u0308/(H \u03c6\u0307). These parameters can be related to the derivatives of the inflaton\npotential \u221a\n\u01eb = (MP2 /2)(V \u2032 /V )2 , \u03b7 = MP2 (V \u2032\u2032 /V ), where\nMP = 1/ 8\u03c0G is the reduced Planck mass in natural\nunits ~ = 1 = c. In the slow-roll approximation, \u01eb \u226a 1\n\n\f2\nand |\u03b7| \u226a 1, the scalar power spectrum turns out to be\nPR (k) =\n\n1\n2MP2 \u01eb(tk )\n\n\u0012\n\nH(tk )\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n.\n\n(2)\n\nIn addition, the power spectrum of tensor fluctuations is\ngiven by\n\u0012\n\u00132\n8\nH(tk )\nPt (k) = 2\n,\n(3)\nMP\n2\u03c0\nand the tensor-to-scalar ratio is then r = Pt /PR =\n16\u01eb. The power spectra are not exactly scale invariant, they can vary with k and this dependence is parameterized by the scalar and tensorial spectral indices\nns \u2212 1 \u2261 d ln PR /d ln k, nt \u2261 d ln Pt /d ln k. Since these\nindices are related to the slow-roll parameters ns \u2212 1 =\n\u22126\u01eb + 2\u03b7 , nt = \u22122\u01eb, one generates immediately the consistency relation r = \u22128nt , which should be verified by\nany single-field slow-roll inflationary model, irrespective\nof the particular form of the potential.\nIn this paper we shall reexamine, on the basis of general principles of quantum field theory in an expanding\nbackground [7, 8], the fundamental expressions (2-3) for\nthe scalar and tensorial power spectrum. In doing this\nwe shall also be led to modify the expressions for the\nspectral indices in terms of the slow-roll parameters and,\ntherefore, to generate a new consistency relation. We\nwill have all the necessary ingredients to reexamine the\nobservational predictions of inflationary models and here\nwe shall do that for some of the most significant models.\nThe second factor in the fundamental relation (1) has\nits origin in the quantum fluctuation of the scalar inflaton field \u03c6. The first-order perturbation \u03b4\u03c6, where\n\u03c6 = \u03c60 (t) + \u03b4\u03c6(x), obeys the wave equation\n\u2202t2 \u03b4\u03c6 + 3H\u2202t \u03b4\u03c6 \u2212 a\u22122\n\n3\nX\n\n\u2202i2 \u03b4\u03c6 + m2 \u03b4\u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere a(t) is the expansion factor of the unperturbed\nhomogeneous and spatially flat metric ds2 = \u2212dt2 +\na2 (t)d~x2 . The effective mass term, which is necessarily\nsmall in the slow-roll approximation, is given by the second derivative of the potential: m2 = V \u2032\u2032 (\u03c60 ). Moreover,\nthe fundamental relation (3) has also the same quantum\norigin. The two independent polarizations of tensorial\nmodes can be described by a couple of scalar fields h+,\u00d7\nobeying the above wave equation with zero mass. The\nrelation between h (we\u221aomit the subindex + or \u00d7) and\n\u03b4\u03c6 is given by \u03b4\u03c6 \u2261 h/ 16\u03c0G.\nLet us focus first on these tensorial perturbations. The form of the modes is then h~k (t, ~x) =\n~\n(1)\n(\u221216\u03c0G\u03c4 \u03c0/4(2\u03c0)3 a2 )1/2 H\u03bd p(\u2212k\u03c4 )eik~x . The index of\nthe Bessel function is R\u03bd = 9/4 + 3\u01eb and the so-called\nconformal time, \u03c4 \u2261 dt/a(t), is given by \u03c4 = \u2212(1 +\n\u01eb)/aH. Notice that, at early times, the amplitude of\noscillations depends on k in a way similar to that of a\nmassless field in Minkowski space. As time evolves, the\n\ncomoving wavelength reaches the Hubble horizon length\nat tk . A few Hubble times after horizon exit the amplitude freezes completely and, for all subsequent times t,\n2\n(tk )\none has the constant value |h~k |2 = GH\n\u03c0 2 k3 . Because of\nthe loss of phase information, the modes of the perturbations soon take on classical properties [9]. The freezing amplitude is usually codified through the quantity\n\u22062h (k, t), defined in general by \u22062h = 4\u03c0k 3 |h~k (t)|2 , and\nevaluated at the horizon crossing tk (or a few Hubble\ntimes after it). Taking into account the two polarizations, one finally obtains a nearly \"scale free\" tensorial\npower spectrum (3). In a similar way one obtains the\nscalar power spectrum (2).\nAt this stage it is important to remark that the above\ndefinition of the power spectrum is such that the quantum fluctuations of the perturbations in position space\nsatisfy the relation\nZ \u221e\ndk 2\n2\nhh (~x, t)i =\n\u2206 (k, t) .\n(5)\nk h\n0\nThis quantity represents the variance of the Gaussian\nprobability distribution associated to h(~x, t). However,\nin the form given by (5), it is divergent. It might be\nargued, as is common when dealing with random fields,\nthat this divergence can be eliminated by smoothing out\nthe field on a certain scale R to remove the Fourier modes\nwith k \u22121 < R. It can also be argued that the value of hh2 i\nis unimportant and regard the (finite) two-point function\nhh(x1 )h(x2 )i, uniquely defined by \u22062h (k), as the basic object. However, it is our view to regard the variance as\nthe basic physical object, which defines the amplitude of\nfluctuations in position space, and treat h(~x, t) as a quantum entity. Therefore, if one regards h(~x, t) as a quantum\nfield, and hh2 (~x, t)i its two-point function at coincident\npoints, the divergences must be handled in a different\nway. Taking into account the large k asymptotic form of\nthe modes one can estimate the form of the integral at\nan arbitrary time\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ \u221e\ndk 16\u03c0Gk 3 a\n(2 + 3\u01eb)\n2\nhh (~x, t)i \u2248\n] + ... .\n[1 +\nk 4\u03c0 2 a3 k\n2k 2 \u03c4 2\n0\n(6)\nThe first term produces a quadratic divergence, which is\nthe typical singularity of a quantum field in Minkowski\nspace. The second term produces a logarithmic divergence, which is typical of a massless field in an expanding universe. For a quantum mechanical system, with\na finite number of degrees of freedom, such a divergent\nbehavior would not arise and one need not worry about\nthe definition of the physical power spectrum. However,\na quantum field is neither a random field nor a quantum mechanical system with a finite number of degrees\nof freedom. The existence of divergences tells us that\nthe nature of a quantum field is more involved. If we\nwish to have a finite expression for hh2 (~x, t)i one should\nsubtract the divergences in a consistent way. In technical words, one should renormalize the quantum field.\nSince the physically relevant quantity (power spectrum)\n\n\f3\nis expressed in momentum space, the natural renormalization scheme to apply is the so-called adiabatic subtraction [10], as it renormalizes the theory in momentum space. Adiabatic renormalization [7, 8, 11] removes\nthe divergences present in the formal expression (5) by\nsubtracting (16\u03c0Gk 3 /4\u03c0 2 a3 )[1/w + \u02272 /2a2 w3 + \u00e4/2aw3 ]\nmode by mode in the integral (5), where w is the frequency of the modes. The subtraction of the first term\n(16\u03c0Gk 3 /4\u03c0 2 a3 w) to cancel the typical flat space vacuum\nfluctuations was already considered in [12]. However, the\nadditional terms, proportional to \u02272 and \u00e4 are necessary\nto properly perform the renormalization in an expanding\nuniverse. Subtracting consistently the divergent terms\none obtains the finite expression\nZ \u221e\ndk 16\u03c0Gk 3\n\u03c4\u03c0\n2\nhh (~x, t)i =\n[\u2212a |H\u03bd(1) (\u2212k\u03c4 )|2\n2 a3\nk\n4\u03c0\n2\n0\n(2 + 3\u01eb)\na\n]] .\n(7)\n\u2212 [1 +\nk\n2k 2 \u03c4 2\nFor the idealized case of a strictly constant H the subtraction exactly cancels out the vacuum amplitude [10]\np\n(1)\nsince H3/2 (x) = i exp(ix) 2/\u03c0x(\u22121 + i/x). From this it\nfollows that in pure de Sitter inflation there is no production of gravitational waves. One would thus expect that\nthe tensorial power spectrum were proportional to the \u01eb\nslow-roll parameter, which parameterizes the slow change\nin H(t). The fluctuations still acquire classical properties\nthrough decoherence in a time of order H \u22121 after their\nwavelengths become larger than the Hubble radius during inflation [9]. Therefore, it is natural to evaluate the\npower spectrum (with the corresponding adiabatic counterterms) a few Hubble times after the time tk . Since\nthe results will not be far different from those at tk , we\nuse that time to characterize the results. We comment\nfurther on this point after (14). Evaluation of the above\nintegral at the time tk leads to the redefinition\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(4 \u2212 \u01eb)\n2\n2 1+\u01eb\n(1)\n2\n\u2206h (k) = 4GH\n,\n|H\u03bd (\u2212k\u03c4 = 1 + \u01eb)| \u2212\n2\n2\u03c0\n(8)\nwhich turns out to be proportional to \u01eb, \u22062h (k) =\n\u03b116\u03c0G(H(tk )/2\u03c0)2 \u01eb(tk ) + O(\u01eb2 ), where \u03b1 is a numerical\ncoefficient of order unity, \u03b1 \u2248 0.904. Taking into account\nthe usual conventions, we get, at leading order in \u01eb,\n\u0012\n\u00132\n8\u03b1 H(tk )\nPt (k) = 2\n\u01eb(tk ) .\n(9)\nMP\n2\u03c0\nOne can proceed in the same way to reevaluate the\nscalar power spectrum. However, to be precise in the\ncalculation, one must keep the mass term in (4) and\nalso take into account the slow decay of the Hubble\nrate H, as above. The latter is controlled by the slowroll parameter \u01eb, while the former is captured by the\nslowly changing parameter \u03b7 \u2261 MP2 (V \u2032\u2032 /V ), which gives\nm2 = 3\u03b7H 2 . The form of the scalar modes is the same\nas that for\u221athe tensorial ones, up to the fact that the\ncoefficient 16\u03c0G is now absent and the Bessel index is\n\nnow \u03bd 2 = 9/4 + 3\u01eb \u2212 3\u03b7. The adiabatic subtracting terms\nare thenpthose already present for a massless field, with\nw(t) = k 2 /a2 + m2 , together with new terms proportional to the mass (k 3 /4\u03c0 2 a3 )[m2 \u02272 /2a2 w5 +m2 \u00e4/4aw5 \u2212\n5m4 \u02272 /8a2 w7 ]. Therefore, after renormalization, the final result for the scalar power spectrum is\nPR\n\n1\n=\n2Mp2 \u01eb(tk )\n\n\u0012\n\nH(tk )\n2\u03c0\n\n\u00132\n\n(\u03b1\u01eb(tk ) + 3\u03b2\u03b7(tk )) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b2 \u2248 0.448 is another numerical coefficient. In the\ncase of eternal de Sitter expansion, one recovers the previous results of [10, 13].\nThe above expression, together with (9) for the tensorial power spectrum, constitute our main results and lead\nto a change in the testable predictions of inflation. To see\nthis we have to consider the scalar and tensorial spectral\nindices. The standard expression for them, in terms of\nthe slow-roll parameters, is ns \u2212 1 = \u22126\u01eb + 2\u03b7 , nt = \u22122\u01eb.\nHowever, if we invoke renormalization we get\nnt = 2(\u01eb \u2212 \u03b7)\n\n(11)\n\n4\u03b1\u01eb2 + (6\u03b2 \u2212 2\u03b1)\u01eb\u03b7 \u2212 3\u03b2(n\u2032t /2 \u2212 4\u01eb(\u01eb \u2212 \u03b7))\n\u03b1\u01eb + 3\u03b2\u03b7\n(12)\nwhere n\u2032t is the running of the tensorial index n\u2032t \u2261\ndnt /d ln k. Note that n\u2032t can be expressed in terms of\nthe slow-roll parameters as n\u2032t = 8\u01eb(\u01eb \u2212 \u03b7) + 2\u03be, where\n\u03be is defined by \u03be \u2261 MP4 (V \u2032 V \u2032\u2032\u2032 /V 2 ). The above formulae provide, implicitly, algebraic relations between physical observables. The most important one is the relation\nbetween the tensor-to-scalar ratio r \u2261 Pt /PR with the\nspectral and running indices: r = r(nt , ns , n\u2032t ). In the\nsimplest case of n\u2032t = 0, and taking the approximation\n\u03b1 \u2248 2\u03b2, the new consistency condition becomes\nr\n11\n96\n96\n(13)\nr = 1 \u2212 ns + nt +\n(1 \u2212 ns )2 + n2t .\n25\n5\n25\nns \u22121 = \u22126\u01eb+2\u03b7+\n\nThis relation could be potentially checked, and compared\nwith the standard one r = \u22128nt , in near future highprecision anisotropy measurements of the CMB. However, we can already contrast, partially, our predictions\nwith the standard ones on the basis of the five year\nWMAP results by performing a model by model analysis. As a representative example we shall reexamine the\n(4\u2212p) p\n\u03c6 and commonomial chaotic potential V (\u03c6) = \u03bbMP\npare with standard theoretical and experimental results\n[3]. It is not difficult to obtain that\nr=\n\n\u03b1p2\np\n, 1 \u2212 ns =\n,\n(3\u03b2(p \u2212 1)/2 + \u03b1p/4)N\n2N\n\n(14)\n\nwhere N \u2261 ln aend /aW MAP is the number of e-folds\nof inflation between the end of inflation and the epoch\nwhen the wavelength of fluctuations that WMAP detects\nleft the horizon. If the adiabatic counterterms were\n\n\f4\n\nFigure 1: Plot of r versus ns . The contours show the\n68% and 95% CL derived from WMAP5 (in combination\nwith BAO+SN) [3]. We consider V (\u03c6) = m2 \u03c62 (solid line),\nV (\u03c6) = \u03bb\u03c64 (dashed line). The symbols show the prediction\nfrom each of this models in terms of the number N of e-folds.\nThe top part corresponds to the prediction of our formulae,\nwhile the bottom one corresponds to the standard prediction.\n\nevaluated some e-folds n after tk but still well before\nthe end of inflation (n\u01eb \u226a 1), then the value of \u03b1 in\nthe tensorial power spectrum would change to \u03b1 \u2248 2n.\nA similar calculation for the scalar power spectrum\nshould also be carried out. This computation should\ndeal with the gauge-invariant quantity Rk , which is\nconserved outside the Hubble sphere and satisfies the\n\n[1] Guth A., Phys. Rev. D23, 347 (1981).

One then finds\nthat the spectral index ns in (14) is unchanged, and the\nratio r becomes r = 4p2 /(p + 2)N , which is not sensitive\nto the value of n. If the counterterms are evaluated far\nbeyond the end of inflation, one recovers the standard\npredictions r = 4p/N and 1 \u2212 ns = (p + 2)/2N . However,\nsince primordial fluctuations acquire classical properties\nthrough decoherence when their wavelengths become\nlarger than the Hubble radius [9], we find it natural to\nevaluate the spectra at a time close to tk , which implies\nsignificant deviations from the standard prediction (see\n(14)). Note that, with the present understanding of\nthe nonlinear aspects of quantum gravity, it is difficult\nto reach a definitive conclusion regarding this question,\nso the fact that there are observable differences offers\na deep way to experimentally probe this question. In\nfact, if we compare the results at tk with the WMAP\n5-year data for the representative values p = 2 and p = 4\n(Figure 1) we find that both models are compatible\nwith the experimental data for the reasonable range of\nN between 50 and 60 (Figure 1 top). This is in sharp\ncontrast with the prediction of the standard approach\n(Figure 1 bottom) where the monomial potential with\np = 4 is excluded convincingly. With the new predictions\nboth models are compatible with WMAP data for all\nthe values of N between 50 and 60. This is also true\neven if the counterterms are evaluated n e-folds after\ntk , with n\u01eb \u226a 1. The alternative predictions presented\nhere may soon come within the range of measurement\nof high-precision CMB experiments, as expected in the\nPLANCK satellite mission.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work has been supported by grant FIS2008-06078C03-02.
