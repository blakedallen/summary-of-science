Skobeltsyn Institute of Nuclear Physics, Moscow State University 119899 Moscow, Russia\nAbstract\nDeveloped earlier concept of quasielastic knock out of pions from nucleons by\nhigh- energy electrons is propounded as a tool for checking microscopical model ( 3 P0\n- fluctuation ) for decay of N to different channels \u03c0 + B and Preparata model of\nnucleus structure.\n\n1\n\nInroduction\n\n1. The quasielastic knock-out (q.e.k.) of protons out of nuclei by high energy electrons\nwas used as mighty tool for investigation of nucleus structure [1]. Then the concept of\nq.e.k. was extended [2] to the knock-out of electrons out of atoms and molecules and by\nthis method very important results for the structure of these microobjects were obtained.\nFor recent time in the literature, the notion of quasielastic knock out is often discussed\nin hadron physics [3]. In general, this term means that in a process almost whole four\nmomentum of a probe is transferred to only one degree of freedom - for instance to nucleon\nin the process of photoproduction of pions on nuclei.\nWe have extended this notion to the quasielastic knock out of mesons from nucleon and\nnuclei and use this notion to clarify some physical problems. In general, the set of diagrams\ngives contributions to the process of photo- or electroproduction of pions on nucleons. For\nexample, in Fig. 1 we show several such diagrams (with pseudoscalar interaction). In\nthe case of photoproduction all of these diagrams play very important role. However at\nsufficiently high square momentum transfer Q2 (Q2 \u2265 1 (GeV/c)2 , and total invariant mass\nof hadrons W \u2265 2 GeV/c (in order to exclude the contributions of resonances) the situation\nbecomes very simple - for longitudinal photons the \"pion in flight diagram\", that is the\ndiagram with pion pole in t-channel, becomes dominant. This was shown in our previous\npapers [4]. It means that in the longitudinal electroproduction in the mentioned kinematics\nthe real knock-out of pion from nucleon takes place. Thus from experimental data one can\nextract the momentum distribution of pion in nucleon and their spectroscopic factors i.e.\nthe number of pions. This notion opens a new possibility for direct investigation of meson\nstructure of nucleon and relevant problems. The similar considerations are also valid for\n\u2217\n\ne-mail:yudin@helena.sinp.msu.ru\n\n1\n\n\fFigure 1: The Born diagrams of photo- and electro-production of pions on nucleon.\nelectroproduction of pions by transverse virtual photons and we have here the knock-out\nof vector mesons with simultaneous transformation of them into pion (the phenomenon of\n\"deexitation\" that is similar to the deexitation of alpha - particles in nuclei). It can also\nprovide a valuable information on the dynamic of vector mesons in nucleon.\n2. Now let's make several remarks about terms in which we shall discuss these problems.\nThe cross section of electroproduction has the following form:\nd\u03c3(\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 n\u03c0 + )\n\u223c \u03b5\u03c3L + \u03c3T\n(1)\ndW dt\nwhere \u03b5 is a usual polarization parameter of the virtual photon, t - momentum square\ntransferred to nucleon, \u03c3L , \u03c3T - longitudinal and transverse cross sections. Analytically the\nhadron part of pion in flight diagram of Fig.1 is written as follows:\nM(p \u2192 n\u03c0 + )\n1\n1\nM(p \u2192 n\u03c0 + )\n=\n*\n=< n|a\u03c0+ |p >\n2\n2\nk \u2212 m\u03c0\nk0 \u2212 ek\nk0 + ek\nk0 + ek\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a\u03c0+ is an operator of virtual pion absorption, k0 - zero component of transferred\nfrom nucleon to photon four vector, ek - energy of the virtual pion with momentum k in\nthe rest frame of proton, p and n - proton and neutron, M(p \u2192 n\u03c0 + ) - invariant amplitude\nof transformation M(p \u2192 n\u03c0 + ). It is important to point out that this equation takes into\naccount simultaneously the diagrams going \"forward and backward\" in time, and that we\nwork in the lab system. The quantity < n|a\u03c0+ |p > defines the momentum distribution of\npions in proton and we call it \"wave function\" and designate by \u03a8n\u03c0\np . This wave function\nis normalized by the condition:\nZ\n\n2\nn\u03c0\nd\u03c4 |\u03a8n\u03c0\np (k)| = Sp\n\n(3)\n\nwhere d\u03c4 = d3 k/((4\u03c0)3 Ep En ), Ep,n - energies of proton and neutron, Spn\u03c0 is a spectroscopic factor of pion in nucleon. It determines the number of pions participating in\nproduction of the channel. The sum of the spectroscopic factors over all final channels will\ngive the total number of positive pions in nucleon.\n\n2\n\n\fAs a result, we get that the longitudinal cross section of pion electroproduction has the\nfollowing form:\nd\u03c3L (\u03b3 \u2217 p \u2192 n\u03c0 + )\n2 2\n2\n\u223c |\u03a8n\u03c0\n(4)\np (k)| F\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0 (Q )\ndt\n2\nwhere t = k 2 and F\u03b3\u03c0\u03c0\n(Q2 ) - electromagnetic formfactor of pion, Q2 - \"mass\" of the\nvirtual photon.\n\n2\n\nCheck of 3P0 fluctuation model\n\nIt is well known, that the hadrons are effective degrees of freedom and the hadron dynamics\nshould be a phenomenological one. The important ingredient of this phenomenology is the\ncoupling constants of meson with baryons. Now when an \"attack\" on hadrons world is wide\nunderway the number of constant becomes big and it is necessary to search for notions,\nthat can unite the description of hadrons. It is naturally, that the search for unification\nshould be based on quark-gluon degrees of freedom. One way to realize this unification is\nto introduce the coupling between quarks and mesons. Then the coupling with baryons\ncomes out as a result of some averaging over quark structure of baryons. Partially this was\ndone in the paper [5]. But this approach entails also many parameters. It is proved that\nan old model of 3 P0 fluctuation has definite advantages. On diagram level this model is\npresented in Fig.2.\n\n3\n\n`4\n\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFigure 2: The diagram of vacuum production of the flavour SU3-invariant quark-antiquark\npair.\nThe advantage of this approach based on the fact that the five quarks in the final\nsystem can be transformed into hadron by many different ways. This permits one on the\nsame footing to consider and therefore to relate the whole set of meson-baryons coupling\nconstants, for instance pion-baryon, kaon-baryon, vector meson-baryon and so on. The\nformal aspects of this rearrangement were considered in our papers [6, 7] and will not be\ndiscussed here. Calculated momentum distributions and formfactors of pions and kaons in\nnucleon are shown in Fig.3,4.\nOne can see that discussed momentum distributions are very interesting and they demand further investigation.\nIn conclusion we would like to remark that 3 P0 -fluctuation is probably closely related\nwith scalar quark condensate. This is one more reason to investigate this model.\n3\n\n\f*\n\n0,035\n\n6\n\nN\n\n**\n\nN\n\n0,030\n5\n\n-3\n\nN\n\nGeV\n\n0,020\n\np\nB\n\np\n\nY\n\np\n\n|\n\np\n\n0,015\n\n|\n\nY\n\nB\n\n0,025\n\n2\n\n| ,\n\n-3\n\n3\n\n| , GeV\n\n2\n\nD\n\n4\n\n0,010\n\n2\n\n0,005\n\n1\n\n0,000\n0\n0,0\n\n0,0\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n2\n\n0,4\n2\n\nk , GeV /c\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n0,2\n\n0,3\n2\n\n0,4\n2\n\nk , GeV /c\n\n2\n\n0,5\n\n0,6\n\n2\n\nFigure 4: The momentum distributions\n2\nof pions |\u03a8B\u03c0\np | in different channels\n(B = N \u2217 , N \u2217\u2217 ).N \u2217 \u2212 N(1535), N \u2217\u2217 \u2212\nN(1440).\n\nFigure 3: The momentum distributions\n2\nof pions |\u03a8B\u03c0\np | in different channels\n(\u03c0B = \u03c0N, \u03c0\u2206).\n\n3\n\n0,1\n\nMesons in nuclei\n\nOver past years, the problem of pions in nuclei was discussed in literature [8] many times.\nFor instance, a very well known paper has a title \"Where is the pions in nuclei\" [9]. We\ncan nott dwell on the details of this very interesting questions and confine ourselves with\nthe statement that now the problem is partially clear - in any case, the pions in nuclei\npredicted by RPA approach were detected and sharp contradiction between prediction of\nthe theory and (p,n) experiment, that was a base for the title of paper [9], was probably\nremoved. In a sense, one really sees the pions in nuclei injected there by RPA correlations\n[10]. New nontrivial aspects of the nuclear pion problem were considered in the paper [11].\nNevertheless the problem of mesons in nuclei is far from its full solution and probably\nthat we will meet here the unexpected and nontrivial phenomena.\nThe first modern nontrivial notion of meson's injection into nuclei was propounded\nby Migdal [12]. Now it seems clear that his notion of pion condensate in nuclei is not\nrealized. But there exists another concept of pion condensate propounded by Preparata\n[13]. Preparata's idea is closely related to the effect of Dicke [14] that is known in atomic\nphysics for several tens of years.\nThe point is: let's suppose that one has a system of N exited atoms. Then as long as\nradioactive transitions take place the probability of transitions becomes bigger and bigger\nand in the \"middle\" - i.e. when about one half of exited atoms is left - the probability\nbecomes as much as N 2 /4. At large N the increase of probability becomes fantastic!\nPreparata has assumed that in nuclei something similar can take place if one takes into\naccount \u2206-resonance. In this case, one has \u2206 \u2192 excited atoms, N \u2192 atom in the ground\nstate, pion \u2192 photon. According to an estimate by Preparata if one takes into account\nthe existence of such transitions the increasing of self-energy of whole nucleus will result in\ngain of energy that amounts 60 MeV per one nucleon! Thus, a heavy nucleus can consist\nof three coherently vibrating subsystems \u2206-nucleons, \u2206-resonances and pions. With the\nusual way of investigation it is not simple task to observe such a substructures. We suggest\n4\n\n\fto use for this purpose the quasielastic knock out of pions. In Fig.5,\nMD\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\nk\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n2\nFigure 5: Momentum distributions of pions in nuclei: solid line - the MD |\u03a8n\u03c0\np (k)| ,\n\u22123\n(GeV/c) versus |k|, GeV/c in Preparata model; dashed line - the MD in the model\nof independent nucleons.\n\nit is shown the momentum distribution of pions that are injected into nuclei by Preparata\nmechanism in comparison with trivial injection by independent nucleons. We see that the\nmomentum distributions of pions, injected by usual mechanisms (independent nucleons)\nand Preparata mechanism are drastically different and measurement of pion momentum\ndistribution helps to prove whether there exists a collective strengthening of pions in nuclei.\n\nReferences\n[1] D.G.
