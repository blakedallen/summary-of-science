Three-dimensional images of fluorescently\nlabeled collagen are obtained by confocal microscopy and the network geometry is extracted using\na 3d network skeletonization algorithm. Each fiber is modeled as a worm-like-chain that resists\nstretching and bending, and each cross-link is modeled as torsional spring.

Since this modeling effort uses\nnetworks with realistic geometries, this analysis can ultimately serve as a tool for understanding how\nthe mechanics of fibers and cross-links at the microscopic level produce the macroscopic properties\nof the network. While the focus of this paper is on the mechanics of collagen, we demonstrate a\nframework that can be applied to many biopolymer networks.\n\nCollagen is the most abundant animal protein [1] and\nits mechanics have been studied in great detail [2]. It\ntakes on many morphologies, including skin, tendons, ligaments, individual fibers, and gels. Of particular interest\nis the mechanics of collagen-I gels, shown in Figure 1a.\nThese gels provide a relatively simple structure that can\nbe noninvasively observed by confocal microscopy [3] and\nused as a scaffold for growing artificial tissues [4], and as\na 3d environment for studying cell motility [5] and tumor\ninvasion [6, 7]. A critical first step in understanding these\nsystems is to develop a model for the collagen gel alone.\nIn this paper we give a successful theoretical model of\nthe micromechanics of realistic networks.\nCollagen-I gels belong to a class of materials known\nas biopolymers. Other examples include actin, found in\nthe cytoskeleton and fibrin, a component of blood clots.\nA common feature of biopolymer networks is their ability to strain stiffen by 2-3 orders of magnitude at large\nstrains (Figure 1f). The cause of this strain stiffening is\nnot well understood. Storm et al. [8] attributed strain\nstiffening in all biopolymer networks to the pulling out\nof entropic modes of individual filaments. Their calculation required the assumption that deformations are\naffine. Later, Heussinger et al. [9, 10] showed how one\ncould deconstruct the network deformation into a set of\nfloppy modes. They concluded that accounting for the\nnon-affinity was necessary in describing the elastic properties of the network. Onck and colleagues [11, 12] have\nproposed the alternative hypothesis that strain stiffening\nis due to the rearrangement of the fibers as the network\n\nis strained (Figures 1d and 1e). Resolving this debate\nhas been difficult since almost all theoretical analysis has\nbeen on artificially generated networks. The few examples of quantitative comparisons to experiment in the literature [8, 13, 14] are not able to quantitatively fit the\nfull stress-strain response of the gel at varying densities\nusing a single set of parameters.\nIn this paper, we bridge the gap between model and\nexperiment. Three dimensional images of fluorescently\nlabeled collagen gels at different densities are imaged by\nconfocal microscopy (Figure 1a) and the network geometry is extracted using a custom FIbeR Extraction (FIRE)\nalgorithm (Figure 1b) [3]. The gel is modeled as a random network of cross-linked fibers, as described below,\nand the stress-strain response is compared to that measured by an AR-G2 rheometer. Good agreement between\nmodel and experiment is obtained by fitting a single parameter, the cross-link stiffness. The experiments are\ndescribed in detail in [3].\nIn the model for the collagen gel, each fiber is treated\nas a discrete worm-like-chain (WLC) [15] which resists\nstretching and bending, and each cross-link is treated as\na torsional spring, thus more stiff than a freely rotating pin joint but less stiff than a welded joint of fixed\nangle. The stretching modulus of an individual fiber is\ngiven by Ks = EA, where E is the Young's modulus and\nA is the cross-sectional area. The Young's modulus of\na fiber in aqueous conditions has been estimated to be\nbetween 30-800 MPa [16, 17, 18] and we use a modulus of 50 MPa, which fits the data well and is also close\n\n\f2\n\na) Max.

(79MPa)\nto fit their model [14]. It has been shown that a single\nfiber will stiffen by a factor of 2-4 when strained [18]. We\nchoose here to use a constant E both to reduce the number of parameters in the model and to see if geometric\nreorientation of the network is enough to explain strain\nstiffening. Stylianopoulos and Barocas [14] also explored\nthe bilinear and exponential constitutive relations for the\nindividual fibers and observed only minor effects on the\nmacroscopic network behavior. The radius of each fiber\nis r = 30 nm [3, 19]. The bending modulus of the fiber is\ngiven by Kb = EI = 32 pN-\u03bcm2 , where I = \u03c0r4 /4 [20].\nNo cross-linking agent has been added to the gel and very\nlittle is known about the nature of the naturally formed\ncollagen cross-links. We find that we can fit all the data\nby setting the torsional spring stiffness to Kx = 300 pN\u03bcm. To compare Kb to Kx , we consider Kb /lc , where the\nmean cross-link spacing is given by lc \u223c 2 \u03bcm [3]. Thus,\nwe find that Kx \u223c 20Kb /lc . One possible reason for a\nlarger Kx could be an increase in fiber radius near the\ncross-links by a factor of 2, since bending stiffness scales\nby r4 .\nWe assume that in the undeformed state of the net-\n\nwork, there are no internal stresses. Thus the fibers have\nan innate curvature and the cross-links have an equilibrium angle equal to that in their initial configuration.\nWe ignore entropic contributions to the fiber mechanics.\nWhile the geometric persistence length of these fibers has\nbeen measured to be 20 \u03bcm [3], the thermal persistence\nlength is much longer lp = Kb /kT \u223c 1 cm. Furthermore,\nin the case that the strain stiffening is dominated by thermal compliance, one would expect to see a decrease in the\nyield strain with increasing concentration [21]. Collagen\ngels, however, have been shown to have a constant yield\nstrain of about 60% for a wide range of concentrations\n[22]. Thus the total energy in the network for a given\nconfiguration is given below.\n\u00012\n\u00012\n\u00012\nNb\nNx\nNs\nX\nX\nX\n\u2206\u03b8xi\nKb \u2206\u03b8bi\nKs \u2206Li\n+\n+\nKx\nU=\nLi\n2\nLi\n2\n2\ni=1\ni=1\nk=1\n(1)\nHere Na is the number of elements of type a \u2208 {s, b, x},\nwhich denotes stretching, bending, and cross-link, Li is\nthe length of stretching element, \u03b8bi and \u03b8xi are the bending and cross-link angles respectively, and \u2206 indicates the\ndifference between the deformed and undeformed state.\nTo calculate the stress-strain relationship of our model\nnetwork, we perform a series of 18 incremental strain\nsteps by imposing a small deformation on one face, F1\nwhile holding the opposite face, F0 fixed. We impose\ntwo types of deformations: tension (Figure 1d) and shear\n(Figure 1e). In a tensile deformation, we allow the vertices on F0 and F1 to move freely in directions perpendicular to the imposed strain to allow for perpendicular\ncontraction that is seen to occur in these experiments\n[22, 23]. In experiments of this type, the distance between F0 and F1 is on the order of centimeters and the\nsimulated network represents a small region near the center of a sample. In shear, we do not allow the boundary\nnodes on F0 and F1 to move freely. We compare the shear\nresults to cone-plate rheometer experiments, where the\nshear faces are bound to the rheometer. Here, the distance between F0 and F1 is 109 \u03bcm, and the simulated\nnetwork is one fourth the length of the experimental sample between the boundaries. In both deformations, all\nother nodes, including those on the four remaining faces\nof the network, are free to move.\nThe minimum energy state of the network at an imposed strain U (\u000fij ) is found using a conjugate gradient\nmethod developed by Hager and Zhang [24]. The stress\nrequired to hold the network in its current configuration\nis given by \u03c3ij (\u000fij ) = (dU/d\u000fij )/A, where A denotes the\narea of F0 . The results shown in Figures 2 and 3 are\naveraged over all four extracted networks and over all 6\nprinciple shear deformations in the sheared network and\nall 3 principle tensile directions in the stretched network.\nThe results from our shear cell experiments are given\nin Figures 2 and 3a.

Note the good agreement between model\nand data at small and large strains. b) When the curves are\nscaled by \u03c12.68 relatively good data collapse is achieved. We\ndenote lines of slope m = 1 and m = 3 to guide the eye. At\nlarge strains, scaling breaks down and the low density curves\novertake the high density curves because at large strains, stiffness scales linearly with density. Thus this rescaling serves\nmainly as a visualization tool and does not represent a true\ndata collapse.\n\nsamples that are centimeters in length [22]. Figure 2a\nshows a strain sweep from 0.5% to 100% shear strain in\nboth the model and cone-plate rheometer experiments.\nAt small strains, the stress-strain response is linear, as\nexpected, and at larger shear strains, the stress-strain\nresponse appears cubic. In Figure 3a, we show that the\nsmall strain modulus scales by \u03c312 \u223c \u03c12.68 \u000f12 , where \u03c1\nis the collagen density. At this time, it is not possible\nto verify the power law scaling in the model since only\ndensities of 0.5, 1.2, and 1.4 were observed. The fluorescent labeling of the network changes the polymerization\nproperties of the network, causing it to clump at higher\ndensities. We use this scaling relationship to collapse the\ncurves in Figure 2b. The close agreement between model\nand experiment indicates that strain stiffening due to the\ngeometric rearrangement of the collagen fibers is enough\nto explain the strain stiffening seen in experiments.\nAt large strains (\u223c 50% in tension, \u223c 200% in shear),\nthe stress-strain curve of the model becomes linear again,\nthough with a much steeper slope. In Figure 3b, we com-\n\npare the large strain tensile behavior of the model to the\nexperiments of Roeder et al. [22]. While our model underestimates their experimental measurement by a factor\nof 2.5, we find this to be reasonable since the two experiments used different collagen protocols. In particular,\ndifferent buffers were used. In Figure 2, we also explore\nthe case where Kx = Kb = 0, such that we have only a\nnetwork of springs connected at freely rotating pin joints.\nAt low strains, the network can be deformed without exerting any stress, but at strains higher than 25%, we see\nthat this simplification adequately describes the gel.\nA topic of investigation explored by many is the validity of the assumption that these networks deform affinely\n[11, 25]. For brevity, we state only that the deformations\nare highly nonaffine in these simulations, as evidenced\nby a visual inspection of Figure 1d and 1e where it is\nobvious that many fibers leave the volume defined by an\naffine deformation.\nIn summary, we have presented a microstructural\nmodel of a 3d biopolymer gel using a network geometry that is based on the true network architecture. It\ndiffers from previous work in that we use realistic network architectures that have been extracted using the\nFIRE algorithm. We specifically focus on the mechanics\nof collagen-I networks, but emphasize that this modeling\napproach is generalizable to other biopolymer networks.\nThe model has three parameters: {E, r, Kx }. The fiber\nradius and tensile modulus can be measured experimentally and the model uses realistic parameters. The crosslink torsional spring constant must be fit to the data and\nwe used Kx \u223c 20Kb /lc . Fitting this single parameter\ngives the right strain stiffening behavior for networks at\nthree different densities at strains that vary from 0.5% to\n50%. This result lends support to the hypothesis put forward by Onck et al. [11] that strain stiffening in polymer\nnetworks, and particularly collagen-I gels, is governed by\nrearrangement of the gel.\nAnother finding of the model is that at strains greater\nthan 25%, the stiffness of the gel is governed almost en-\n\n\f4\ntirely by stretching of the fibers. This result is relevant\nfor collagen because cells embedded in these gels are seen\nto produce deformations of this order of magnitude [26].\nIn modeling large systems of this type where the strains\nare large, it may be sufficient to treat each fiber as a\nspring rather than a WLC in order to reduce the computation time. This work also demonstrates that an understanding of the cross-link mechanics in these systems is\ncritical to understanding their mechanical properties, as\nhas been seen previously [27]. In much of the theoretical\nwork that has been done on random stick networks, the\ncross-links are treated either as freely rotating pin joints,\nor welded joints of fixed angle [11, 21, 25]. While these\nare sensible simplifying assumptions in developing a theory, they are not adequate for describing actual networks.\nWe note that this model has been designed to capture\nthe short time scale (< 1 hr) behavior of the network,\nwhere it behaves as an elastic solid. Such behavior requires that the cross-links be relatively fixed [28]. This\nsimplified model provides a starting point in the development of a more complete model of collagen gel. Ultimately, a more sophisticated approach, such as that\ntaken by Rodney et al. [29] will be necessary to capture\nthe full dynamic behavior of the gel, where cross-links\nare allowed to slip and break.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank V.
