Rotation curves are determined by\nthe full distribution of the mass of a galaxy, including its luminous component\n(the disk) and its dark component (the halo). While the radial distribution\nof the luminous matter is observed for spiral disks, the disk mass itself is unknown. Regarding the Dark Matter, both the amount and the distribution\nare unknown, and since these physical quantities affect the rotation velocity\nprofile in a different way at different radii, the study of the rotation curves\nbecomes a very important tool to investigate the structure of galaxies.\nThere is sometimes the idea that the smoothness of the observed rotation\ncurves implies a fine-tuning of the halo/disk structural parameters. Related\nto it, although logically orthogonal, there is the view that, due to this smoothness, it is impossible to disentangle the dark and luminous components of a\nRC, because very different mass models are thought to \"produce\" the same\nrotation curve 1 . The aim of this paper is to show that both these ideas are\nincorrect, i.e. that a) the characteristics of the observed RCs do not imply\nthe existence of a fine-tuning in the halo and the disk structural parameters,\nbut, on the contrary, these parameters take all the physically possible values\nand still produce smooth RCs, and b) \"physically\" different mass models yield\ndetectably different RCs, provided that the observational data fulfill well defined high-quality requirements.\nWe model the rotation curves of a galaxy from the distribution of the luminous\nand Dark Matter. We do not aim at the determination of the true Dark Matter\ndensity profile, issue that has to be dealt with by a different approach. Instead\nwe assume the most popular density profiles, and we investigate the characteristics of the corresponding RCs. In detail, we study a pseudo-isothermal (PI)\nhalo profile, suggested by observations (Persic et al. 1996), and a Navarro,\nFrenk & White (NFW) halo profile (Navarro, Frenk, & White, 1997) emerged\nin CDM N-body simulations.\nIn section 2 we present the rotation curves derived for a PI halo profile (2.1),\nand for a NFW halo profile (2.2), and we discuss their characteristics. In section 3 we investigate the possibility of uniquely deriving, from an high-quality\nrotation curve, the actual mass model. Finally, in section 4 we summarize the\nresults.\n\n1\n\nDue to the results of this paper, we find no reason to explicitly identify the\nsupporters of these ideas.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nGeneric mass models produce smooth, featureless Rotation Curves\n\nThe total mass of a disk galaxy can be divided into two independent components, namely the luminous disk and the Dark Matter halo (neglecting the\nbulge is irrelevant in our study). These components contribute separately to\nthe total rotation velocity:\nV 2 (r\u0303) = Vd2 (r\u0303) + Vh2 (r\u0303)\n\n(1)\n\nFor the luminous matter, we consider the stellar disk, whose surface density\nprofile is found as:\n\u03a3(r) = \u03a30 e\u2212R/RD\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a30 is the central surface density, and RD is the disk scale lenght 2 . The\ndisk component of the velocity is (Freeman, 1970):\nVd2 (r\u0303) =\n\nGMD\n\u03bd(r\u0303)\nRD\n\n(3)\n\nin which MD is the disk mass and \u03bd(r\u0303) = r\u0303 2 /2 * (I0 K0 \u2212 I1 K1 )|r\u0303/2 , with I0 K0\nand I1 K1 being the Bessel functions of order 0 and 1, evaluated at r\u0303/2.\nFor the DM halo, we investigate both the PI profile and the NFW profile,\n(see figure (1) for comparison), with the halo velocity component being:\nVh2 (r\u0303) =\n\nGMH (r\u0303)\nr\u0303 RD\n\n(4)\n\nwhere MH (r\u0303) is the dark halo mass inside the radius r\u0303.\nThe contribution of the luminous matter to the total rotation velocity is determined by two parameters: the disk scale lenght RD , measured in each galaxy,\nand the total mass MD , that can be obtained, at least in principle, from the\ndisk luminosity, but since its determination is affected by large uncertainties,\nit is usually considered as an unknown quantity. The dark component of the\nrotation velocity has two free parameters, the central halo density and the\nhalo characteristic scale lenght, that fully determine the DM distribution.\n\n2\n\nIt's worth noticing the observational relationship\nbetween the circular rotation\n\u0001\nV3\nvelocity (V3 \u2261 V (3RD )) and RD : RD \u2243 5 200 kpc (Persic et al. 1996).\n\n3\n\n\fFig. 1. The normalized PI and NFW halo density profiles.\n\n2.1 PI halos\n\nThe DM density distribution of pseudo-isothermal (PI) halos is given by:\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c10\n1 + (r/RC )2\n\n(5)\n\nFor convenience we define: r\u0303 \u2261 r/RD as the galactocentric distance, and R\u0303C \u2261\nRC /RD as the core radius of the halo, both in units of the disk scale lenght.\nWe take R\u0303C as a free parameter and we consider its possible variation range\nbetween 0 and infinity. R\u0303C < 1 implies a mass distribution very similar to that\nof the NFW profile (see subsection 2.2). On the other hand, cases with R\u0303C > 3\nare scarcely distinguishable from one another, since most of the observational\ndata do not reach regions of disks beyond r\u0303 = 3.\nThe mass of the dark halo as a function of the normalized radius is obtained\nas:\nMH (r\u0303) =\n\n3\n4\u03c0G\u03c10 R\u0303C3 RD\n\n\"\n\nr\u0303\nr\u0303\n\u2212 tan\u22121\nR\u0303C\nR\u0303C\n\n!#\n\n(6)\n\nWe define:\nR\u03033\n\u03bb(r\u0303) \u2261 C\nr\u0303\n\n\"\n\nr\u0303\nr\u0303\n\u2212 tan\u22121\nR\u0303C\nR\u0303C\n\n!#\n\n4\n\n(7)\n\n\fThe total rotation velocity of the galaxy can therefore be written as:\nV 2 (r\u0303) =\n\n3\nGMD\nG4\u03c0\u03c10 RD\n\u03bd(r\u0303) +\n\u03bb(r\u0303)\nRD\nRD\n\n(8)\n\nIt is useful to perform the following transformation:\nGMD\n,\n\u03b1\u2261\nRD V12\n\n3\n4\u03c0G\u03c10 RD\n\u03b2\u2261\n,\nRD V12\n\n\u03bb1 \u2261\n\nR\u0303C3\n\n\"\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 tan\u22121\nR\u0303C\nR\u0303C\n\n!#\n\nThe parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 are directly proportional to the fraction, at RD , of\nthe luminous and dark mass respectively. We define V12 \u2261 V 2 (r\u0303 = 1)). The\nradial profile of the normalized rotation velocity is then given by:\nV 2 (r\u0303)\n= \u03b1 \u03bd(r\u0303) + \u03b2 \u03bb(r\u0303)\nV12\n\n(9)\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03bb determine the shape of the curve, while V12 determines its amplitude. Let's stress that, as concerning the results of this section, the actual\nvalue of the constant V1 is irrelevant since, as a normalization parameter, it\ndoesn't affect the RC shape. From (9) it follows that:\n\u03b1 \u03bd1 + \u03b2 \u03bb1 = 1\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03bd1 = \u03bd(r\u0303 = 1). We notice that \u03b1\u03bd1 and \u03b2\u03bb1 represent the fractional\ncontributions to the total (normalized) velocity at RD due to the luminous\nand Dark Matter respectively; for simplicity we define fDM \u2261 \u03b2\u03bb1 .\nWe now rewrite the radial profile of the normalizated rotation velocity as\nV 2 (r\u0303)\n\u03bb(r\u0303)\n\u03bd(r\u0303)\n+ fDM\n= (1 \u2212 fDM )\n2\nV1\n\u03bd1\n\u03bb1\n\n(11)\n\nunder the following ranges of variations:\n0 \u2264 fDM \u2264 1\n\n0 \u2264 R\u0303C \u2264 3\n\nIn this way, we split the original three free parameters into a 2+1 combination:\n2 determine the RC profile and 1 sets the RC amplitude. We allow the free\nparameters related with the profile to vary over a very wide range of values,\nand we plot the corresponding curves as functions of radius r\u0303.\nIn figure (2) we present typical rotation curves we obtain for a variety of cases,\nincluding those with almost no Dark Matter in the central regions and those\nstrongly halo-dominated, as well as those with large and small core radii. The\n5\n\n\fFig. 2. PI rotation curves, for different fDM and normalized R\u0303C . The curves represent the total rotation velocity (thick line), the disk-component velocity (dotted\nlines) and the halo-component velocity (dashed lines).\n\nFig. 3. PI rotation curves with a second-order anomaly, indicating a sharp transition\nbetween a disk-dominated to a halo dominated region.\n\n6\n\n\fcurves are plotted for 0 \u2264 r\u0303 \u2264 4, covering the radial range of the observations.\nWe realize that the variations of the parameters affect only the RCs' slopes:\nas fDM increases, the curves become progressively more halo-dominated and\ntherefore steeper, and the effect is enhanced for increasing R\u0303C . However, as the\nparameters vary, there are no peculiar features in the RCs, no flexes indicating a discontinuity between a disk-dominated and a halo-dominated regime.\nIn fact, the transition between these two regions appears smooth, and does\nnot cause irregularities in the curves, at least in the zones actually mapped\nby data. No fine-tuning in the amount of the Dark Matter or in its density\ndistribution parameters is required to obtain a smooth and featureless RC,\nlike, for instance, those of the URC (Persic et al. 1996; see also Appendix A).\nNotice however that we can build a few peculiar models in which the transition between a disk-dominated to a halo-dominated region makes itself visible\nin the RC profile, locally modifying the RC shape in a significative way. In\nfigure (3) we show four of these cases. Anyway, they are very extreme, in that\nthese galaxies have unrealistically low amounts of Dark Matter, fDM \u2264 3%,\nand very large core radii, R\u0303C \u2265 6. Moreover, the flex in the curve, although\nquite significant, appears at galactocentric distances that are beyond the usual\noutermost radius reached by observational data. It is worth to point out that\nthese peculiar RCs have the same profile often thought to be the standard\noutcome of the luminous and Dark Matter distributions in disk galaxies. Instead, to be detected in the RCs, these features require a careful setting of the\nfree parameters. The general properties of the dark and luminous matter that\nwe observe in spirals make sure that, if a fine-tuning is needed to reproduce\nan observed RC, it is to feature irregularities, not smoothness.\n\n2.2 NFW halos\n\nWe now adopt the Dark Matter distribution of NFW halos (Navarro et al.\n1997):\n\u03c1(r)\n\u03b4C\n=\n\u03c1crit\n(r/RS ) (1 + r/RS )2\n\n(12)\n\nwhere the density is normalized to the critical density of the Universe, and \u03b4C\nis the central density contrast (with respect to the external background). RS\nis the halo characteristic lenght scale, and again we define: R\u0303S \u2261 RS /RD and\nr\u0303 \u2261 r/RD . The mass of the dark halo inside a given radius is now:\n3\nMH (r\u0303) = 4\u03c0\u03c1crit \u03b4C R\u0303S3 RD\n\n\"\n\nr\u0303\nln 1 +\nR\u0303S\n7\n\n!\n\n1\n\u2212\n(1 + R\u0303S /r\u0303)\n\n#\n\n(13)\n\n\fAfter defining, in replacement of equation (7):\nR\u03033\n\u03c9(r\u0303) \u2261 S\nr\u0303\n\n\"\n\nr\u0303\nln 1 +\nR\u0303S\n\n!\n\n1\n\u2212\n(1 + R\u0303S /r\u0303)\n\n#\n\n(14)\n\nand using equations (1), (3) and (4), we write the expression for the total\nrotation velocity:\nV 2 (r\u0303) =\n\n3\nGMD\nG4\u03c0\u03c1crit \u03b4C RD\n\u03bd(r\u0303) +\n\u03c9(r\u0303)\nRD\nRD\n\n(15)\n\nSimilarly to the previous subsection, we set:\nGMD\n,\n\u03b1\u2261\nRD V12\n\n3\n4\u03c0G\u03c1crit \u03b4C RD\n\u03b2\u2261\n,\nRD V12\n\n\u03c91 \u2261\n\nR\u0303S3\n\n\"\n\n1\nln 1 +\nR\u0303S\n\n!\n\n1\n\u2212\n1 + R\u0303S\n\nand we get the normalized total velocity profile:\nV 2 (r\u0303)\n= \u03b1 \u03bd(r\u0303) + \u03b2 \u03c9(r\u0303)\nV12\n\n(16)\n\nwith the constraint given by equation (10); finally, we obtain the parametrized\nexpression for the rotation curve:\nV 2 (r\u0303)\n\u03bd(r\u0303)\n\u03c9(r)\n= (1 \u2212 fDM )\n+ fDM\n2\nV1\n\u03bd1\n\u03c91\n\n(17)\n\nAgain, the two parameters fDM and R\u0303S completely characterize the rotation\ncurve profile. In figure (4) we show the NFW RCs for the same values of the\nparameters as the PI case, and we find a very similar behaviour: in general,\nNF W + disk curves are even smoother and flatter than the P I + disk ones;\nalso in this case the emerging RCs have no second-order irregularities associated to a luminous-to-dark regime transition, at least in the regions contained\ninside 4 disk scale lenghts.\n\nIn the region contained inside the stellar disk edge, general PI and NFW\nmass models predict, for all values of the model free parameters, RCs that are\nsmooth and featureless, i.e. with no flexes and inversion of the first derivative.\n8\n\n#\n\n\fFig. 4. NFW rotation curves, for different fDM and normalized R\u0303C .\n\n3\n\nDisentangling a high-quality RC\n\nRCs are smooth and featureless when considered at small scales, and they\nshow no individual charecteristics, apart from a different value of their \"largescale\" slope. This is evident in the model RCs of the previous section and in\nthe observational scenario provided by the URC.\nThe further question is: how well does a rotation curve yield the true mass\nmodel of a galaxy? Moreover, is the information we obtain from the observational data unique and model-independent? In other words, can we distinguish\nbetween different Dark Matter amounts and distributions by analyzing a rotation curve? In this section we will answer these questions for the PI case,\nwhich presents a number of difficulties, since it is partially degenerate with\nrespect to its structural parameters fDM and R\u0303C . The NFW case will not\nbe considered here in that, having one free parameter less than the PI case\nand a known radial behaviour of the velocity profile, any result we find in our\ninvestigation for the PI will apply also to the CDM profile.\nLet's assume then that galaxies are composed by an exponential thin disk\nsurrounded by a PI dark halo, and estimate the precision with which we can resolve the luminous and the Dark Matter distribution from the rotation curve.\nNotice that the Universal Rotation Curve and the individual RCs are well\nfitted by a P I + disk model (Donato, Gentile & Salucci 2004; Gentile et al.\n2004).\nWe build a family of 25 reference curves that simulate \"observed\" RCs of real\ngalaxies, each one consisting of 25 data points, evenly spread between 0 and 4\n9\n\n\fFig. 5. The 25 reference \"observed\" rotation curves.\n\ndisk scale lenghts, and is characterized by a set of two parameters in the ensemble: fDM = {0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9} \u2297 R\u0303C = {0.1, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}. To each\npoint of these curves we assign \"observational\" errors of the order to those of\nhigh-quality published RCs (Persic & Salucci 1995): \u01ebV = 0.02 is the averaged\nuncertainty in V (r\u0303), and \u01ebD = 0.05 in the RC slope. These curves are shown\nin figure (5).\nWe investigate each of the \"observed\" RCs with a mass model, fitting the data\nto obtain their structural parameters. We remind that a successful strategy\nis accomplished by means of three suitable free parameters, namely the dark\nhalo core radius R\u0303C , the relative contribution of the Dark Matter to the total velocity fDM and the absolute value of the rotation velocity at a distance\nfrom the centre of one disk scale lenght V1 . Of these parameters, two affect\nthe shape of the RC, and one, V1 , affects its amplitude. If the observed RC is\nof high quality, then it's possible to set the value of V1 directly from the data,\nreducing the number of free parameters. In this case,\nV1 \u2261 V (1) \u00b1 O(10\u22122 )\n\n(18)\n\nLet us caution that this cannot always be done: we define a high-quality RC\nas a set of kinematical data for which such a parameter reduction is possible.\nTherefore, the reference \"observed\" RCs are fitted with the following mass\nmodel (see equation 11):\n2\nVmod\n(r\u0303) = V 2 (1) [(1 \u2212 fDM ) \u03b3L (r\u0303) + fDM \u03b3DM (r\u0303; R\u0303C )]\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03b3L (r\u0303) \u2261 \u03bd(r\u0303)/\u03bd1 is known, and \u03b3DM (r\u0303; R\u0303C ) \u2261 \u03bb(r\u0303; R\u0303C )/\u03bb1 (R\u0303C ).\nThe measure of the distance between a model curve and an \"observed\" RC is\n10\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n1\n\n1\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n0.6\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n0.8\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n\n4\n2\n1\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n1\n\n1\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n1\n\n1\n0.4\n\n1.5\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.4\n\n1.5\n\n0.2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n\n-2\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n-1\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFig. 6.

The \"true\" parameters\nare: (R\u0303C = 1.0,fDM = 0.3) (top panels), (R\u0303C = 2, fDM = 0.5) (middle panels),\n(R\u0303C = 3, fDM = 0.7) (bottom panels). Right: \u03c72T OT for the same cases.\n\ngiven by a likelihood parameter, that we define as the sum of the \u03c72 computed\non the velocity and on the RC slope:\n\u03c72T OT = \u03c72 [V ] + \u03c72 [D]\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the terms on the right-hand side are:\n\u03c72V\n\n25 \u0010\n\u00112\n1 X\nVmod (r\u0303n ; [fDM , R\u0303C )]mod ) \u2212 Vobs (r\u0303n )\n([fDM , R\u0303C ]mod ) = 2\n\u01ebV n=1\n\n(21)\n\n\u03c72D ([fDM , R\u0303C ]mod ) =\n\n25\n1 X\nr\u0303n dVmod (r\u0303n ; [fDM , R\u0303C )]mod )\nr\u0303n dVobs (r\u0303n )\n\u2212\n2\n\u01ebD n=1 Vmod\ndr\u0303\nVobs\ndr\u0303\n\n!2\n\n(22)\n\nWe denote with Vmod and Vobs the velocities of the model curves and of the\nreference curves respectively.\n11\n\n\fThe need of considering the contribution of the gradient of the velocity in the\ncomputation of the likelihood parameter is well explained by the examples\nshown in figure (6). In the left panels we show the value of the \u03c72V only, as\na function of the values of the model parameters, for three different reference\ncurves. The 1\u03c3 contour of \u03c72V includes also values of the parameters far from\nthe \"true\" ones, unveiling a certain inability of the model to disentangle the\nmass components. With the information given by the gradient of the circular\nvelocity and by the \u03c72T OT as defined in equation (20), the degeneracy of the\ndifferent model curves largely disappears. In the right panels of figure (6) we\nshow the resolution reached now: we find that the \u03c72T OT rises sharply to a\nvalue of \u223c 102 in an interval of \u2206fDM \u223c 0.05 and of \u2206R\u0303C < 0.25. These\nvalues set the resolution scale of the fit.\nFor each one of the 25 \"observed\" reference curves, we perform the fit with\nthe model given by equation (19), considering a very large range for the values\nof its parameters. We quantify the \"success\" of the fit by the computation of\n\u03c72T OT for each model curve considered. We now perform a general analysis\nof the behaviour of \u03c72T OT , computed for 10.000 couples reference \"observed\"\nRC - model curve. It is worth to consider \u03c72T OT as a function of the following\nsuitable \"distance\" in the paramater space: D \u2261 (\u22062 (R\u0303C /4) + \u22062 (fDM ))1/2 ,\nwith \u2206(x) = xmod \u2212 xobs (notice that, since the range of variation of RC is four\ntimes that of fDM , we normalize the former by a factor of 4 to make the two\ncontributions to D comparable). The result is shown in figure (7a). The red\ncircles represent cases in which the distance is dominated by the variation of\nthe core radius ( \u22062 (R\u0303C /4) > \u22062 (fDM )), the blue triangles cases in which the\ndistance is mainly due to the variation of the amount of Dark Matter. The\nstraight lines represent the limit value of \u03c72T OT corresponding to 3\u03c3 and 1\u03c3.\nMost of the points lay over the 3\u03c3 limit, indicating that the two curves of each\ncouple are well resolved and therefore distinguishable.\nThe vertical line defines a distance in the parameter space of D = 0.25. The\npoints in the range D \u2264 0.25 and laying below the 3\u03c3 limit, although representing cases in which the model fails in fitting uniquely a RC, can be considered\nirrelevant and will not be counted in the statystics: in fact, the parameters\ndefining the curves are so close to each other, that even if a RC has multiple\nfits, they differ one from the other by a negligible amount.\nIn the interval 1 \u2212 3\u03c3 we find about 0.9% of the total cases, and below the\n1\u03c3 limit about 0.23%. The cases below the 1\u03c3 limit have to be considered as\nfailures of the model in uniquely distinguishing the Dark Matter distribution,\nand those below the 3\u03c3 limit as partial failures: therefore, studying our simulated \"observed\" RCs we find that there is a total possibility of only about\n1% not to resolve (completely or partially) the mass model.\nLet's recall that we adopted the observational errors that are typical of about\nthe top 50% of the observed RCs available today, for which, through the application of this procedure, there are very good possibilities to disentangle the\nmass distribution. However, it is possible to obtain an observed RC with an\nerror even smaller than the one we adopted: for about the top 10% of the\n12\n\n\fa)\n\nb)\n\nFig. 7. \u03c72T OT of the 25 reference \"observed\" curves mapped with 400 model curves,\nas a function of the distance in the parameter space. Red points (circles) are for\ndistances dominated by the variation of R\u0303C , blue points (triangles) are for distances\ndominated by the variation of fDM . The straight lines represent the 1\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 limits.\nPanel a) \u01ebV = 0.02 and \u01ebD = 0.05. Panel b) \u01eb = 0.01 and \u01ebD = 0.03.\n\n13\n\n\fRCs available today we can consider observational errors of \u01ebV = 0.01 and\n\u01ebD = 0.03, and the number of these curves is going to increase in the future.\nThe same analysis performed with these errors yields a \u03c72T OT vs D relation as\nshown in figure (7b).\nNow we have only about the 0.15% of cases in the interval 1 \u2212 3\u03c3, and only\nthe 0.02% is below 1\u03c3; the worst case among these sets the lower limit for\nthe resolution of our model: (\u2206(fDM ))M AX = 0.25 and (\u2206RC )M AX = 1.2RD ,\nwhich is still a reasonable uncertainty.\nTherefore, considered the very small amount of cases below the 3\u03c3 limit,\nwe can state that the average resolution that we reach corresponds to the\nstep with which we select the model parameters, i.e. (\u2206(fDM )) = 0.05 and\n(\u2206RC ) = 0.2RD .\n\n4\n\nSummary and conclusions\n\nWe studied a model galaxy composed of a stellar disk embedded in a dark halo,\nand we constructed a family of rotation curves by varying the two parameters\nthat affect the RC shape, i.e. the fractional contribution of the Dark Matter\nto the normalized rotation velocity at a reference radius, and the dark halo\ncharacteristic scale lenght. We investigated two different profiles for the distribution of the Dark Matter, i.e. a pseudo-isothermal and a Navarro, Frenk &\nWhite profile. In both cases we find that no fine-tuning is needed to reproduce\nthe characteristics of the observed galaxy rotation curves, i.e. the evidence\nthat they are smooth, with no irregularities like flexes in correspondence of\nthe transition from the disk-dominated into the halo-dominated region.\nEventually, irregularities do show up in the PI case, but only for extreme,\ntuned values of the Dark Matter content and distribution (fDM \u2264 0.1 and\nR\u0303C \u2265 6), and only beyond the disk edge. Since a similar result holds also for\nthe NFW profile, we can conclude that, not only no fine-tuning is needed to\nreproduce the smoothness of the rotation curves, but the case is the opposite:\na fine-tuning is required to obtain a \"marked\" curve.\nSecondly, with the purpose of investigating how effective is the process of\nmass modelling the RC, i.e. what is the precision with which we can infer a\nDark Matter profile from the kinematics, we performed a statistical analysis\non a large number of curves, assuming that the Dark Matter distribution is\nwell described by a PI halo. We studied 25 reference rotation curves, representing actual observed RCs, by means of a suitable mass model. We applied\na maximum-likelihood method to assign a fitting model curve to each \"observed\" RC, and we found that in the 99% of cases we resolve the RC and\ndistinguish between different Dark Matter distributions, while in the 1% of\ncases we found a degeneracy in the parameters. For this reason we can state\n14\n\n\fthat, disposing of observations having a good accuracy and data for a sufficiently high number of radii, the distribution of the Dark Matter inside an\nobserved galaxy can be determined from the RC.\nOf course, these results refer to the adopted profile used to describe the dark\nhalo, for which the objection of the non-uniqueness of the mass modelling\nwas raised. Also, our results don't minimize at all the importance of complementary methods for determining the mass components of galaxies, like those\ncoming from lensing, or those used to measure the disk masses (see Verheijen\n2004).\nWith respect to the more general issue of determining the Dark Matter distribution in galaxies, several different profiles have been proposed to shape the\ndark halo, and the debate about which one is the favoured is still open. The\ncoming of new-generation telescopes, that will provide high-precision observations of the galactic dynamics, together with an improvement in the resolution\nof numerical simulations, will surely shed light on this topic. However, a deeper\ntheoretical understanding of the structure of Dark Matter halos may still be\nrequired.\n\nA\n\nUniversal Rotation Curve\n\nFig. A.1. The normalized Universal Rotation Curve.
