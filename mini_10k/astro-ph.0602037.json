This is made possible by the extensive photometry obtained\nduring 2002, 2003 and 2004, as well as the long photometric time base starting in 1992.\nIn this star, three frequencies show strong amplitude and phase variations. In the power\nspectrum, these frequencies also show up as frequency doublets. However, since true\namplitude variability of a single frequency can also lead to (false) frequency doublets\nin the power spectrum, a specific test examining in detail the observed amplitude\nand phase variations of an assumed single frequency is applied. For the frequencies at\n12.15 and 23.40 cycle d\u22121 it is shown that amplitude variability of a single mode can\nbe ruled out. In particular, an important property of beating between two modes is\nfulfilled: the amplitude and phase vary synchronously with a phase shift close to 90\u25e6 .\nThe origin of the amplitude variability of a third mode, viz. near 19.86 cycle d\u22121 , is\nnot clear due to the long beat period of 20+ years, for which the amplitude/phase\ntest suffers from gaps in the coverage. However, even for this frequency the amplitude\nvariations can be expressed well by a mathematical two-mode model.\nIf we examine these three close frequency pairs together with other (usually more\nwidely separated) close frequencies in FG Vir, 18 pairs of frequencies with separations\ncloser than 0.10 cycle d\u22121 have been detected. It is shown that the majority of the pairs\noccur near the theoretically expected frequencies of radial modes. Mode identifications\nare available for only a few modes: the only detected radial mode at 12.15 cycle d\u22121\nis part of a close pair.\nIt is shown that accidental agreements between the frequencies of excited modes\ncan be ruled out because of the large number of detected close frequency doublets.\nKey words: \u03b4 Scuti \u2013 stars: oscillations \u2013 stars: individual: FG Vir \u2013 Techniques:\nphotometric\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe search for the astrophysical reason of the observed amplitude and phase variability associated with stellar pulsation concerns many different types of stellar pulsators in\nvastly different stages of stellar evolution. We refer to this\nphenomenon as the Blazhko Effect, which was noticed by\nBlazhko (1907) in the RR Lyrae star RW Dra. These variations are quite common in RR Lyrae stars, e.g., Szeidl (1988)\nmentions an occurrence of 20 - 30 % in the RRab stars. We\nare presently engaged in an extensive programme to examine the Blazhko Effect in RR Lyrae stars. However, the effect\nhas also been noticed among other types of pulsators. Some\nexamples are:\nc 0000 RAS\n\n(i) Cepheids: The cepheids with very short periods often show long-term amplitude variability. Probably the bestknown example is the star V473 Lyr (HR 7308) with a radial\npulsation period of 1.49 d and a Blazhko period \u223c 1258 d.\nThe observed amplitude variability (by at least a factor of\n15) during the Blazhko cycle could not be fit by a simple\ntwo-frequency beating model alone (Breger 1981). This is\nalso evident from the fact that the amplitude variations are\nnot symmetric on the increasing and decreasing branches\n(see also Burki, Mayor & Benz 1982). If beating is involved,\nat least three frequencies are required. Some indications for\na triplet in the Fourier spectrum were seen in the Hipparcos\nmeasurements analyzed by Koen (2001).\n(ii) Another example is provided by the sdB stars:\n\n\f2\n\nM. Breger and A. A. Pamyatnykh\n\nsignificant amplitude variations are detected with a time\nscale of about a year (Kilkenny et al. 1999) or even shorter\n(Pereira & Lopes 2004). O'Toole et al. (2002) have argued\nthat the variability may be caused by the beating of close\nfrequencies with a frequency separation of 0.1 cycle d\u22121 or\nless. However, more detailed investigations may be needed.\n(iii) Most \u03b2 Cephei variables also show amplitude variations with a variety of time-scales of under a year (e.g., in\nEN Lac, Lehmann et al. 2001) up to decades or even several\ncenturies (see Chapellier 1986).\n(iv) White Dwarfs: Handler et al. (2003) analyzed new\ntime-series photometry of two pulsating DB white dwarfs\nand concluded that the observed amplitude and period variability cannot be explained by the beating of multiple pulsation modes.\n(v) Many \u03b4 Scuti variables show amplitude variability\nassociated with the multimode pulsation. Similar to the situation seen in white dwarfs, the same star may appear to\nchange its pulsation spectrum to appear as if they were different stars at different times. However, detailed analyses of\n4 CVn showed that the modes do not disappear, but are still\npresent at small amplitudes. For the majority of the wellstudied stars, frequency pairs with frequency separations\nless than 0.06 cycle d\u22121 can be seen in the power spectra.\nThese pairs may be a reflection of close frequencies, amplitude variability of a single mode or observational errors. For\nthe star BI CMi, Breger & Bischof (2002) showed from detailed phase-amplitude tests that the amplitude variability\nwas the result of beating of separate modes with close frequencies. This paper also summarizes the situation in these\nstars.\nThe Blazhko Effect, therefore, exists in many types of\nstellar pulsators. It is presently uncertain whether a single\nphysical mechanism is responsible for the phenomenon in all\nthese stars. We wish to distinguish between two explanations\nfor the observed amplitude and phase variability observed\nin so many types of pulsating stars:\n(i) The amplitude variability is caused by beating between two (or more) close frequencies. Since amplitude variability is common, the occurrence of close frequencies cannot\nbe an accidental coincidence between randomly distributed\nfrequencies. In this hypothesis, a physical mechanism must\nexist to excite the close eigenfrequencies to observable levels.\n(ii) True amplitude and phase variations not caused by\nbeating. These include periodic behavior, possibly caused by\nrotational modulation or magnetic fields, or cycle-to-cycle\nvariations as observed in Miras.\nThe observational tests to distinguish between the different physical explanations require a very large amount of\ndata covering many months over several years, so that detailed analyses are so far available only for BI CMi. In this\npaper, we want to examine the \u03b4 Scuti star FG Vir, for\nwhich extensive data and multifrequency analyses are available (Breger et al. 2004, 2005: note that the table of frequencies given in the latter reference already refers to the\nanalysis carried out in this paper, and lists some preliminary\nresults). The previous work has shown that in FG Vir three\nmodes seem to possess strongly variable amplitudes.\nThe present paper also examines the systematics of the\noccurrence of close frequencies, defined here as multiple frequencies separated by 0.1 cycle d\u22121 or less.\n\n2\n\nMETHOD TO SEPARATE TRUE\nAMPLITUDE VARIABILITY FROM\nBEATING\n\nIn the Fourier spectrum of short data sets, two close frequencies beating with each other appear as a single frequency\nwith variable amplitude. For long data sets with sufficient\nfrequency resolution, two peaks will be shown. In the case of\na single frequency with variable amplitude and/or phasing,\nalso two (or more) peaks occur. Consequently, the appearance of two peaks does not prove the existence of two separate modes, while the absence of a double peak does not\nexclude the possibility. This is a fact well recognized in the\nliterature.\nIt is important to apply an additional method beyond\nrecognizing two peaks in the power spectrum to separate\nthe two hypotheses. This is especially the case whenever the\ndetection of the two peaks could be due to imperfect data\ncoverage such as data length being of the order of the beat\nfrequency. Fortunately, beating between two (or more) frequencies produces amplitude and phase variations which are\nmathematically related. The most extreme and easily recognizable situation occurs when two close frequencies have the\nsame amplitude: this leads to a half a cycle phase shift at the\ntime of minimum amplitude of the visible (single) frequency.\nEven when the amplitudes differ, beating has a specific signature in the amplitude of phase shifts of an assumed single\nfrequency. In particular, the amplitude and phase vary synchronously with a phase shift close to 90\u25e6 (Tsesevich 1975).\nTherefore, it is possible to separate beating from true\namplitude variability by studying the relationship between\nthe amplitude and phase variations of an assumed single\nfrequency. The method consists of obtaining an extensive\nphotometric data base, subdividing the data into short time\nbins and calculating the amplitude and phase of an assumed\noptimum single frequency for each time bin. Furthermore,\nif other pulsation frequencies are also present, they need to\nbe corrected for. In practice, large differences in the amplitudes of the frequencies beating with each other, observational noise, as well as short (relative to the beat period)\ndata sets may make the recognition difficult.\n\n3\n\nDATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe recent multifrequency analysis of FG Vir (Breger et al.\n2005) led to the detection of more than 75 frequencies, of\nwhich the vast majority are independent pulsation modes,\nrather than harmonics or combination frequencies. It had\nalready been known before the extensive 2002\u20132004 data\nset became available that some of the frequencies show amplitude variability from year to year. This was confirmed\nby the new data set. Furthermore, the discovery meant that\nFG Vir behaved like other well-studied \u03b4 Scuti stars without\nsupplying an astrophysical explanation for this behavior.\nHowever, the 2002\u20132004 data set is unusual in that it\nprovides excellent frequency resolution due to its coverage\nlasting 98, 160, 165 nights in 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. The coverage is sufficient to relate the amplitude and\nphasing variability within each year. The data are ideal to\nexamine Blazhko cycles with periods from days (due to the\ndense coverage) to several months.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fAmplitude variability or close frequencies in pulsating stars?

Note that a single-frequency model with only amplitude variability excludes phase changes. The diagram\nshows that beating between two frequencies separated by 0.0078 cycle d\u22121 and an amplitude ratio of 0.19 is responsible. This is shown\nby the excellent two-frequency fit as well as the correct signature of beating: the amplitude and phase vary synchronously with a phase\nshift close to 90\u25e6 .\n\nFor longer cycles, even the excellent coverage for three\nyears would be insufficient and we have to include some data\nfrom 1992 \u2013 1996 (1992: Mantegazza, Poretti & Bossi 1994;\n1993: Breger et al. 1995; 1995: Breger et al. 1998, 1996:\nViskum et al. 1998). These older data are considerably less\nextensive and the prewhitening of a 75+ frequency solution\ndetermined from 2002\u20132004 would be problematical. Furthermore, the long interval between 1996 and 2002 is difficult to bridge. Consequently, the data are used only to look\nfor very long Blazhko cycles. The slightly more extensive\n1995 data can be used to check the 2002\u20132004 results.\nThe lengthy coverage in the years 2002\u20132004 makes the\ndata suitable for subdivisions into time bins of one or two\nweeks. This allows us to examine the change in pulsational\nbehaviour on a time scale of weeks or months. The obvious\ndifficulty in this approach lies in the fact that 75+ frequencies of pulsation have been identified for FG Vir and that\nindependent one-week solutions including all these frequencies would be completely unreliable: aliasing as well as the\nlack of frequency resolution within the week introduce large\nuncertainties. It is necessary to remove all the periodic content outside the frequency range of interest without affecting\nthe modes to be examined for duality: global prewhitening\nof all frequencies outside the range of interest is required.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nThe following approach was used for each frequency region of interest (e.g., 12.1 to 12.2 cycle d\u22121 ):\n(a) For each of the v and y passbands, we calculated\nan optimum multifrequency fit for the combined 2002\u20132004\ndata. This included all 80 frequencies listed in the table by\nBreger et al. (2005). This led to 80 amplitude and 80 phase\n(epoch) values. These were used to prewhiten the data for\nall the frequencies outside the chosen frequency range, i.e.,\nfewer than 80 frequencies were used.\n(b) The data were divided into time bins covering approximately one week. The actual time covered in each bin\ndepended on the coverage and the number of measurements\navailable so that in some cases slightly longer time bins were\nchosen.\n(c) To improve the signal/noise ratio it is useful to analyze the v and y data together. The pulsations of the star\nare, however, wavelength dependent. The prewhitened frequencies were treated correctly, since the prewhitening was\nperformed with separate solutions for the two passbands.\nThis only leaves potential problems for the mode(s) inside\nthe chosen frequency region of interest. They were solved\nin the following manner: The larger pulsation amplitudes in\nthe v passband were corrected for by scaling the magnitudes\nby an experimentally determined factor of 0.70 and increasing the weight in all the calculations by 1/0.70. The phase\n\n\f4\n\nM. Breger and A. A. Pamyatnykh\n\nlags between the two passbands were taken into account by\ncomputing for each time bin the deviations in phase from\nan overall average for the passband.\n(d) We then adopted the best value of a single frequency\ninside the frequency region of interest and computed the\namplitude changes and phase shifts for each time bin. The\nresults were examined for consistency between the separate\nyears and the relationship between the measured amplitude\nand phase changes (e.g., see the comparison shown in Fig.\n1).\n(e) A two-frequency model to give the lowest residuals in magnitudes was determined from Fourier analyses of\nthe observed light curves and multifrequency fits from PERIOD04 (Lenz & Breger 2005). The result was checked by\na Fourier analysis of the observed amplitude variations.\n(f) The two-frequency model was used to replace the\nobserved magnitudes by predictions for the same times of\nmeasurement. We used the method outlined previously in\n(d) to compute the single-frequency amplitude changes and\nphase shifts for each time bin (this time, however, for the\npredicted two-frequency data). These were then compared\nwith the values derived from the actual observations and are\nshown as dotted lines in Figs. 1 to 4.\n\n4\n\nCLOSE MODES AT 12.15 CYCLE D\u22121\n\nWe have subdivided the available data from 2002 \u2013 2004\nand applied the method described in the previous section.\nThe best single frequency was found to be 12.15412 cycle\nd\u22121 . Fig. 1 shows the variations in amplitude and phase\nfor the three years. In this figure, the uncertainties were\ncalculated by using the standard relations for calculating\namplitude and phasing uncertainties (Breger et al. 1999b)\ntogether with error propogation formulae to account for the\nmeasurements in two different passbands.\nThe variations are similar in all three years with a beat\nperiod of 128 d. Another important result is that the phase\nchanges are coupled to the amplitude changes. In particular, minimum amplitude occurs at the time of 'average'\nphase and the time of most rapid phase change. This suggests beating by two separate close frequencies. The visual\nresult is confirmed by a two-frequency model with the optimum parameters of frequency, amplitude and phase determined by PERIOD04. An excellent agreement is obtained\nfor both the amplitude and phase changes with the twofrequency model. If we extend the analysis to include the\n1995 data, we also find an excellent agreement between the\npredicted and observed amplitudes and phases of the earlier\nmeasurements.\nWe conclude that the amplitude and phase variations\nof the 12.15 cycle d\u22121 frequency can be explained by the\nbeating of two close frequencies.\n\n5\n\nCLOSE MODES AT 23.40 CYCLE D\u22121\n\nThis frequency also shows considerable amplitude variations\nfrom 2 to 6 mmag as well as phase changes. These variations\ntake place from year to year as well as within a single observing season. This is shown in Fig. 2. We notice that the\n\nsituation is quite similar to that of the 12.15 cycle d\u22121 frequency, except that the Blazhko period is longer by about a\nmonth. Again, the signature of beating is evident: minimum\namplitude occurs at the time of 'average' phase and the time\nof rapid phase change.\nThe fit of the two-frequency model is quite good, but\ntwo items need to be discussed: the amplitude may not be\nconstant from year to year and one point fits poorly: this\npoint at HJD 245 2809 has by far the smallest number of\nmeasurements because they were obtained at the end of the\nobserving season. Consequently, the error bars are larger,\nbut the point still deviates by more than 2 standard deviations.\nThe amplitude increases from 2002 to 2004. This is also\nseen in a different way: after prewhitening two frequencies\n(23.4034 and 23.3973 cycle d\u22121 ) with constant amplitudes,\nthe Fourier analysis reveals a third frequency with a small\namplitude (Table 1). The Fourier analysis shows two possible\nvalues for this third frequency: 23.3915 and 23.3942 cycle\nd\u22121 . The first value forms an almost equidistant triplet with\nthe previously found doublet, while the other value shows a\n2:1 distance ratio in frequency spacing. At this stage, we\nare not able to judge whether or not this triple frequency\nsplitting has a physical meaning, but note that it does not\ncorrespond to the effects of annual aliasing, which leads to a\nsmaller splitting of 0.0027 cycle d\u22121 . Furthermore, rotational\nsplitting can also be ruled out since it is a factor of 100 larger\n(\u223c 0.53 cycle d\u22121 ). Trial calculations with PERIOD04 show\nthat the value of 23.3942 cycle d\u22121 (rather than 23.3915\ncycle d\u22121 ) leads to lower residuals in every one of the years\nwith observations and is subsequently adopted.\nThe third frequency provides an excellent fit, but we\ncannot disprove the possibility that it is just an artefact of\ntrue amplitude variability of one of the two modes involved\nin the frequency doublet. The main effect of the third frequency is to introduce slow amplitude changes.\nWe conclude that the 23.40 cycle d\u22121 frequency consists of two close frequencies beating with each other. The\nfit is improved by the addition of a small-amplitude third\nfrequency, which might not be an independent mode.\n\n6\n\nTHE AMPLITUDE VARIATION OF THE\n19.87 CYCLE D\u22121 FREQUENCY\n\nIn the previous papers on FG Vir, the amplitude variations\nin V of the 19.87 cycle d\u22121 frequency were already noticed\n(1985/6: 2.6 mmag, relatively poor data; 1992/3: 4.3 mmag;\n1995: 3.5 mmag, 1996: 2.8 mmag; 2002-4: 1.4 to 2.0 mmag).\nA cursory inspection of the data also indicates phase variations. These are the signatures of the Blazhko Effect. However, the statistical significance of some of these variations\nstill needs to be examined in a more detailed analysis which\nexcludes potential errors caused by the other frequencies of\nthe pulsating star.\nWe consequently apply the technique outlined in the\nprevious section to this frequency as well. We notice immediately that rapid variations within a single observing season,\nfound above for the other two modes, are not present. This\nis demonstrated in Fig. 4, where we have adopted the best\nsingle frequency to fit the 1995 and 2002-4 data (19.867908\ncycle d\u22121 ).

The open circles represent\nthe observations, while the dotted line is the two-frequency fit. The diagram shows that the amplitude variability has a long time scale.\nFurthermore, no single frequency can fit the observations, even if variable amplitudes are allowed. The varying sizes of the statistical\nuncertainties in the observed phases from year to year are caused by the dependence on the size of the amplitudes.\n\nations on a time scale of many years. Note that a frequency\nvalue near 19.867801 cycle d\u22121 can fit the 2002-4 phases,\nbut produces large phase shifts for the 1995 (and for the\nless extensive 1992, 1993 and 1996 data as well).\nThe observed variations can be successfully modelled\nwith two close frequencies separated by 0.00013 cycle d\u22121\n(Blazhko period \u223c 21 years). The good fit is shown in the figure. However, the question examined in this paper is whether\nthe data suggest that two frequencies are really excited in\nthe star. For such a long Blazhko period the question cannot\nbe answered in a definite way due to the incomplete Blazhko\nphase coverage and lack of observed repeated Blazhko cycles. Consequently, the two-frequency fit might just be no\nmore (and no less) than an excellent mathematical representation of the observed amplitude and phase variations\nby two frequencies. Note that at 12.15 and 23.40 cycle d\u22121\nexcellent mathematical two-frequency fits were also available, but that the detailed observed phasing between the\namplitude and phase changes provided an additional excellent verification of the beating hypothesis. This additional\nverification is weaker for 19.87 cycle d\u22121 .\nThe results for the three tested regions with closest frequencies are summarized in Table 1 together with those for\nother close frequencies of potential interest.\n\n7\n\nAFFINITY FOR RADIAL MODES?\n\nIn the previous sections we have examined the observed\namplitude variability. We have shown that at least for two\nmodes this is caused by beating between close frequencies.\nWe shall now turn to the observed ubiquity of close frequencies in FG Vir, using the definition of close frequencies\nas those with a separation less than 0.1 cycle d\u22121 . The ma-\n\njority of these pairs are so well separated in frequency that\nthese pairs do not show up in data as single frequencies with\nvariable amplitudes. Consequently, amplitude/phase tests\nare not necessary or possible in order to exclude the possibility of spurious results from amplitude variability. The frequency distribution of close frequency pairs may contain important information about their physical origin. Fig. 5 shows\nthat the frequency pairs are not randomly distributed.\nIn this figure we have plotted the frequency values for\nall pairs with a separation less than 0.1 cycle d\u22121 . The y-axis\nrepresents the frequency separation for each pair, and each\npoint corresponds to two very close frequencies. Also shown\nare the computed frequencies of the radial modes for the\nFG Vir model which fits both empirically estimated global\nstellar parameters and radial fundamental mode frequency\nat the observed frequency 12.154 cycle d\u22121 . The observed\nmode was certainly identified as radial by Viskum et al.\n(1998), Breger et al. (2005) and Daszy\u0144ska-Daszkiewicz et\nal. (2005). One additional observed mode, 16.071 cycle d\u22121 ,\nwas also identified by Daszy\u0144ska-Daskiewicz et al. (2005)\nas a radial mode. An observed close frequency pair occurs\nhere too (16.071 and 16.091 cycle d\u22121 ). However, the frequency values predicted by our model are slightly different\n(see values below) and this mode identification needs to be\nconfirmed independently with different methods.\nThe effective temperature of FG Vir has been determined from atmospheric models and Stromgren photometry. The luminosity has been determined from the Hipparcos parallax. The following values have been obtained:\nlog Teff = 3.869 \u00b1 0.012, log L/L\u2299 = 1.170 \u00b1 0.055, in agreement with the values of Daszy\u0144ska-Daszkiewicz et al.

The computations were performed starting with\nchemically uniform models on the ZAMS, assuming an initial hydrogen abundance X = 0.70 and heavy element abundance Z = 0.02. The proportions in the abundances of the\nelements heavier than helium were adopted according to\nGrevesse & Noels (1993). For the opacities, we used the\nOPAL data (Iglesias & Rogers 1996) supplemented with\nthe low\u2013temperature data of Alexander & Ferguson (1994).\nThe newest version of the OPAL equation of state was used\n(Rogers & Nayfonov 2002). No overshooting from the convective core was allowed. In the stellar envelope, the standard mixing-length theory of convection with a mixinglength parameter \u03b1 = 0.5 was used. This relatively low value\nof the mixing-length parameter was chosen taking into account the conclusion of Daszy\u0144ska-Daszkiewicz et al. (2005)\nthat convection is rather inefficient in FG Vir.\nWe assumed uniform (solid-body) stellar rotation and\nconservation of global angular momentum during evolution\nfrom the ZAMS. These assumptions were chosen for simc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nplicity reasons. The influence of rotation on the evolutionary tracks of \u03b4 Scuti models was demonstrated by Breger\n& Pamyatnykh (1998). At relatively low rotational velocities of about 60 to 70 km/s, the evolutionary tracks are\nlocated close to those for non-rotating stellar models. The\nmain effect of rotation is the splitting of the nonradial mode\nfrequencies. Even for slowly rotating stars, this splitting is\nasymmetric due to the second-order effect of rotation. The\nwhole frequency spectrum of unstable nonradial modes will\nbe considered in the next paper where possibilities to explain\nthe appearance of very close frequencies will be discussed.\nHere we note the small, but not negligible effects of rotation\non the frequency spectrum of radial modes. This is caused\nmainly by the small change in the model structure due to\nthe variations of the effective gravity inside the star. For\nexample, if we fit the frequency of the radial fundamental\nmode to the observed value of 12.154 cycle d\u22121 , we obtain\nthe frequency of the 6th radial overtone equal to 34.536 cycle\nd\u22121 and 34.345 cycle d\u22121 for the equatorial rotational velocities of 49 km s\u22121 and 81 km s\u22121 , respectively. Additional\ntests show that a small decrease of the heavy element abundance (say, to Z = 0.015) and a small change of opacities\n\n\f8\n\nM. Breger and A. A. Pamyatnykh\n\n(by using new OP data according to Badnell et al. 2005 and\nSeaton 2005) may result in a very good fit of the frequency\nof the 6th overtone to the observed frequency of the close\npair at 34.12 cycle d\u22121 . Another possibility to achieve such\na fit is to suggest still faster rotation (Vrot of about 90-100\nkm s\u22121 ) which is outside the allowed limits. \u22c6\nWe also tested many other models with the global parameters inside the error box of the effective temperature\nand luminosity. Again, we have considered only those models\nwhich fit the radial fundamental mode frequency to the observed frequency of 12.154 cycle d\u22121 . Therefore, only moderate changes in the model parameters and in the input\nphysics were allowed. We varied the following parameters:\n(i) mass, (ii) chemical composition (by choosing Z = 0.015,\nfor example, and by changing the proportions in the abundancies of the elements heavier than helium as were determined very recently by Asplund et al. 2004, 2005 for the\nSun), (iii) the opacity data (by using new OP data according to Badnell et al. 2005 and Seaton 2005), and (iv) the efficiency of overshooting from the convective core. All these\nmodels, when fitted to the observed frequency of 12.154 cycle d\u22121 as the radial fundamental mode frequency, give very\nsimilar frequencies of radial overtones, which do not differ\nsignificantly from the frequencies shown in Fig. 5.\nThe figure shows that the majority of the close frequencies are found near expected radial modes, which are\npredicted to have values of 12.155, 15.700, 19.442, 23.195,\n26.960, 30.704, 34.469 cycle d\u22121 from the fundamental to\nthe 6th overtone pulsator. These values are calculated for\nthe model with Vrot = 62.5 km s\u22121 . As it was noted earlier\nin this Section, the moderate rotation does not influence the\nradial mode frequencies significantly: if we fit the frequency\nof the radial fundamental mode to the observed value of\n12.154 cycle d\u22121 , the frequency of the 6th radial overtone\nchanges from 34.536 cycle d\u22121 to 34.345 cycle d\u22121 when the\nequatorial rotational velocity changes from 49 km s\u22121 to 81\nkm s\u22121 . For lower overtones the effect will be proportionally smaller. Therefore, our result that the frequency pairs\ncluster around the radial modes would be valid for every\nreasonable value of the rotational velocity.\nThe agreement suggests that an accumulation of nonradial modes around the radial frequencies may occur. The\nsituation seems to be similar to that observed in RR Lyrae\nstars (Olech et al. 1999). Another observational fact may link\nthe Blazhko Effect in RR Lyrae and \u03b4 Scuti stars: in most\nclose pairs the components have very different amplitudes\n(Table 1). Important differences between two types of stars\nalso exist: in RR Lyrae stars, the radial modes always dominate in the frequency spectrum. Also, the frequency spectrum of nonradial modes is much sparser and mode trapping\nis less effective in \u03b4 Scuti stars than in RR Lyrae stars.\n\n\u22c6 In the paper of Breger et al. (1999a) a good fit of the frequency\nof the 6th radial overtone to the observed frequency at 34.12 cycle\nd\u22121 was achieved with the OP opacity data for an FG Vir model\nof standard chemical composition and relatively low rotational\nvelocity of 45 km s\u22121 (see Fig. 7 in that paper). However, there\nwe used a previous version of the OP data which did not include\nimportant atomic effects in deep stellar interiors. The new OP\ndata are in better agreement with the OPAL data if we use the\nsame chemical composition for both sets.\n\n8\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFG Vir has such an extensive photometric data coverage\nwith excellent frequency resolution that the relationship between the amplitude and phase variations could be examined in detail. The results presented in the previous sections\nfully support the interpretation of beating between two (or\nmaybe more) close frequencies. If we consider the fact that\nmore than 75 frequencies have been detected for FG Vir\nwith values between 5.7 and 44.3 cycle d\u22121 , the question\narises of whether such an agreement could be accidental. In\nparticular, we need to calculate the probability of accidental\nagreements.\nLet us consider the 12.15 cycle d\u22121 pair with a separation of 0.0078 cycle d\u22121 . If we assume a random distribution of frequencies and adopt a Poisson distribution, we\nobtain 0.02 expected pairs. Of course, the frequencies are\nnot distributed at random. Let us examine a frequency region which shows the largest number of detected modes, i.e.\nfrom 10 to 13 cycle d\u22121 region (Fig. 6). This increases the\npredicted number of accidental agreements to 0.03 pairs. For\ntwo or more pairs detected in a star, an explanation of all\nagreements being caused by accident must be rejected.\nAn accidental agreement may exist: the doublet at\n42.1030 and 42.1094 cycle d\u22121 . The value of 42.1030 cycle\nd\u22121 is a 2f harmonic of a relatively high-amplitude (3 mmag)\nmode at 21.0515 cycle d\u22121 . The 42.1030 cycle d\u22121 peak may,\ntherefore, be a consequence of a not completely sinusoidal\nlight curve, rather than an independent mode.\nFig. 5 has shown the large number of close frequency\npairs in FG Vir. There exist additional close frequency pairs\nin FG Vir beyond those examined in detail in this paper\n(e.g., at 34.1151 and 34.1192 cycle d\u22121 ), but their amplitudes are too small for the tests used in this paper.\nWe conclude that most of the close frequency pairs\nfound in FG Vir (and in some other \u03b4 Scuti stars such as\nBI CMi) are not accidental and an astrophysical origin needs\nto be found. This work is presently in progress.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank Katrien Kolenberg for many helpful discussions.
