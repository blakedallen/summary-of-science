Recent observations have revealed energetic molecular bubbles and high velocity\ncompact clouds (HVCCs) which are also considered to be probes of massive stellar clusters\n(Oka et al. 2007; Tanaka et al. 2007, 2009). Many theoretical and observational studies have\nbeen conducted to understand how gas is supplied for these cluster formation activities, and\nhence for the formation of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) wherein massive stars are formed.\nBinney et al. (1991) theorized a model of gas kinematics in the bar-potential in the inner\nGalaxy, in which the gas inflows from the innermost cusped x1 orbit to the x2 orbits. The\nbar-induced gas flow can trigger large scale mass condensation in the x1 -x2 orbit-crowding\nregions and subsequent burst-like cluster formation in Sgr B2 (Hasegawa et al. 1994). The\ngas in the x2 orbits is assumed to be transported to the central \u223c10 pc region possibly by\nthe inner bar of the Galaxy or by other processes (Morris & Serabyn 1996; Namekata et al.\n2009). This secondary gas flow could facilitate the formation of GMCs in the Sgr A complex,\nthe circumnuclear disk (CND) and the massive stellar clusters in the Sgr A and Radio Arc\nregions (Namekata et al. 2009; Oka et al. 2011).\nAtomic carbon (C0 ) can be used as an indicator of GMC formation process in the CMZ.\nThe origin of abundant interstellar C0 has been a controversial issue and several explanations\nhave been proposed. In terms of chemical evolution, C0 is thought to be abundant in the\nearly stage of molecular cloud formation (Suzuki et al. 1992; Lee et al. 1996; Maezawa et al.\n1999); C0 is mainly present in the interface layer between the atomic and molecular phases in\nthe photodissociation regions (PDRs; Hollenbach & Tielens 1999), but it is also abundant in\nthe inner regions of young molecular clouds because C0 \u2192CO conversion requires a timescale\nof the order of Myr (Suzuki et al. 1992; Lee et al. 1996). This timescale is comparable to\nthe dynamical timescales of molecular clouds, and hence one can expect molecular cloud\nformation regions to be clearly visible owing to their high C0 abundances.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nJaffe et al. (1996), Ohja et al. (2001) and Martin et al. (2004) conducted surveys of\nthe submillimeter [C I] emission toward the CMZ. Ohja et al. (2001) found that the [C I]\n3\nP1 \u20133 P0 /13 CO J=1\u20130 ratio was uniform throughout the CMZ, whereas Jaffe et al. (1996)\nshowed an increase in the ratio for the inner 6 pc region of the CMZ. However, these studies\nwere conducted with insufficient spatial resolution or limited spatial coverage, and hence\nthe spatial variation in the C0 abundance in the CMZ was not investigated in detail. In\nthis paper, we present a new high-resolution [C I] 3 P1 \u20133 P0 map of the CMZ, and report the\ndiscovery of molecular clouds with high C0 abundance.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nWe carried out mapping observations of the CMZ in the [C I] 3 P1 \u20133 P0 (492.1607 GHz)\nline by using the Atacama Submillimeter Telescope Experiment (ASTE; Ezawa et al. 2004)\n10 m telescope in October and November 2010. As a front-end we used the ALMA band 8\nQM receiver (Satou et al. 2008). The telescope beam size was 17\u2032\u2032 at 500 GHz. The digital\nbackend was operated in the wide-band mode with a channel width of 512 kHz. The typical\nsystem noise temperature during the observations was 2000\u20133000 K.\nWe performed on-the-fly (OTF) scans covering the \u22120.2\u25e6 < l < 1.25\u25e6 \u00d7 \u22120.1\u25e6 < b < 0\u25e6\nregion. The reference position was taken at (l, b)=(1\u25e6 , \u22121\u25e6 ). The antenna pointing was\nchecked by CO J=4\u20133 observations toward V1427 Aql, and the pointing accuracy was maintained within 5\u2032\u2032 . The data was formed into an l-b-vLSR data cube with a 17\u2032\u2032 \u00d717\u2032\u2032 \u00d72 km s\u22121\ngrid and a 34\u2032\u2032 angular resolution. The antenna temperatures were calibrated using a standard chopper-wheel method, and were then corrected for the main-beam efficiency of 0.50.\nThe estimated rms intensity calibration error was 8 %. The total on-source integration\ntime was 8 hours, thus giving an rms noise level of 0.3 K in the TMB scale. The intensity\nscale was checked by comparing our data with the data obtained using the CSO telescope\n(Serabyn et al. 1994). The peak intensity at (l, b) = (\u22120.056\u25e6 , \u22120.045\u25e6 ) was 7.0 \u00b1 0.3 K in\nour data, which was in good agreement with the intensity of 7 K in the CSO data.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nRESULTS\n\n[C I]-enhanced Regions\n\nFigure 1 shows the velocity-channel maps of the [C I] line in a velocity range from \u221260 to\n120 km s\u22121 . By comparing the maps with the 13 CO J=1\u20130 map (Oka et al. 1998), we observe\nseveral regions with high [C I]/13 CO intensity ratio. M\u22120.02\u22120.07 (the 50 km s\u22121 cloud)\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nhas a [C I] peak intensity that is approximately twice those of M\u22120.13\u22120.08 (the 20 km s\u22121\ncloud) and Sgr B2, whereas these three GMCs have similar peak 13 CO intensities (Oka et al.\n1998). Another notable observation is the strong [C I] emission from CO+0.02\u22120.02 in high\nvelocity channels (vLSR \u2265 100 km s\u22121 ). CO+0.02\u22120.02 is one of the most energetic HVCCs\nin the CMZ (Oka et al. 2008). Despite its weak detection in the 13 CO map, the peak [C I]\nintensity of this cloud is very high (5.5 K) and is comparable to the [C I] intensity in Sgr B2.\nWe made a scatter plot of the 13 CO intensity versus the [C I] intensity (T13 CO and T[CI] ,\nrespectively). The [C I] data were convolved with a 60\u2032\u2032 beam and regridded to match the\nresolution of the 13 CO data. The velocity resolution of the [C I] and 13 CO data was also\nreduced to 4 km s\u22121 in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The scatter plot shown in\nFig.2 clearly indicates the presence of [C I]-enhanced region in the CMZ. The data points are\ndivided into two components according to their T[CI] /T13 CO ratios: a bulk component with a\nuniform T[CI] /T13 CO ratio of 0.45, and another component with a ratio approximately twice\nthat of the bulk component.\nWe extracted clouds that belong to the latter, [C I]-enhanced component according to\nthe following criteria: (1) T[CI] > 0.45 \u00d7 T13 CO + 3\u03c3, where \u03c3 is the noise level of T[CI] , and (2)\nthe size of the high T[CI] region is greater than one resolution element in each of the l, b, and\nvLSR directions. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the [C I]-enhanced regions in the velocityintegrated intensity map and the l-vLSR diagram. The [C I]-enhanced regions correspond to\nthree clouds in Sgr A: M\u22120.02\u22120.07, CO+0.02\u22120.02 and the CND. An increase in T[CI] /T13 CO\nratio for the Sgr A complex has been observed in the low-resolution data of Ohja et al. (2001),\nand our results show that the increase is mainly due to the contribution from M\u22120.02\u22120.07.\nThe Sgr A complex has another massive GMC M\u22120.13\u22120.08, but this cloud has a typical,\nlow T[CI] /T13 CO ratio.\nFigure 2b shows that the 180-pc ring also has a high T[CI] /T13 CO ratio, although most\npart of the ring was not identified as a [C I]-enhanced region according to the above criteria\nowing to its low [C I] intensity. The best-fit value for the T[CI] /T13 CO ratio was 0.88.\n\n3.2.\n\nC0 /CO Abundance Ratio\n\nWe carried out a large velocity gradient (LVG) analysis to estimate the NC0 /NCO column\ndensity ratio on the basis of the T[CI] /T13 CO ratio. For the bulk component, the NC0 /NCO\nratio was calculated as 0.26, assuming both the [C I] and 13 CO lines to be optically thin,\nTkin = 50 K and nH = 103.5 cm\u22123 (Martin et al. 2004; Nagai et al. 2007). The C/13 C\nisotopic ratio was assumed to be 24 according to Langer & Penzias (1990).

The [C I] and 13 CO data are smoothed to 60\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 60\u2032\u2032 \u00d7\n4 km s\u22121 resolution. Only independent pixels are plotted. (b) same as (a), but the 180-pc\nring is plotted with colored points.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nCMZ environment, T13 CO decreases with increasing excitation temperature of the 13 CO line,\nwhereas T[CI] is insensitive to the physical conditions. Hence, the enhanced T[CI] /T13 CO ratios\nof M\u22120.02 \u2212 0.07, CO+0.02 \u2212 0.02, the CND and the 180-pc ring can be attributed either\nto high C0 abundance or to high excitation temperature of 13 CO.\nThe T[CI] /T13 CO ratio averaged over M\u22120.02\u22120.07 was 0.87, which is likely to be caused\nby the enhanced NC0 /NCO ratio. Otherwise, the T[CI] /T13 CO ratio of 0.87 would require\nTkin = 370 K when nH = 103.5 cm\u22123 or nH = 104.6 cm\u22123 when Tkin = 50 K; however, it\nis unlikely that the entire cloud has temperature or density of an order higher than the\nCMZ average. On the basis of a multi-transition study on CO and 13 CO, Martin et al.\n(2004) estimated that Tkin = 50\u201360 K and nH = 103.6 cm\u22123 at the center of M\u22120.02\u22120.07.\nMinh et al. (2005) showed that the 13 CO J=2\u20131 excitation temperature was 15\u201330 K for\nboth M\u22120.02\u22120.07 and M\u22120.13\u22120.08, and these values are in good agreement with those of\nMartin et al. (2004). We calculated the NC0 /NCO ratio as 0.47 by assuming that Tkin = 60 K\nand nH = 103.6 cm\u22123 .\nThe T[CI] /T13 CO ratios for CO+0.02\u22120.02 and the CND were 2.0 and 2.7, respectively;\nhowever, it is not clear whether they have enhanced C0 abundances because we could not estimate their 13 CO excitation temperatures accurately. The Tkin and nH values were measured\nto be Tkin = 63\u2013450 K and nH = 104.1\u20137 cm\u22123 (Oka et al. 2011, and references therein).\nThe T[CI] /T13 CO ratio of 2.7 for the CND can be explained by the reasonable assumption\nthat Tkin = 160 K and nH = 106.5 cm\u22123 even if the NC0 /NCO ratio is assumed to be the\nsame as that for the bulk component. For CO+0.02\u22120.02, Oka et al. (2008) estimated that\nTkin & 60 K and nH & 104.2 cm\u22123 , which yields NC0 /NCO . 0.68.\nThe temperature and density of the 180-pc ring were estimated as \u223c 30 K and \u223c\n10\ncm\u22123 , respectively (Nagai et al. 2007). The NC0 /NCO ratio was then estimated to\nbe 0.61\u20130.77 by assuming C/C13 = 24. However, this NC0 /NCO ratio may be overestimated\nbecause a higher C/13 C isotopic ratio of & 40 has been suggested for the ring (Riquelme et al.\n2011). The NC0 /NCO ratio decreases to 0.37\u20130.47 if we adopt 40 instead of 24 as the C/13 C\nratio.\n3.0\u20133.5\n\n4.\n\nDISCUSSIONS\n\n4.1.\n\nM\u22120.02\u22120.07\n\nM\u22120.02\u22120.07 is the largest [C I]-enhanced region in our data sets.

(1999) found a '[C I]-rich' molecular cloud in the Taurus region and concluded\nthat the cloud was at an early stage of evolution from the atomic gas. However, unlike the\nquiescent dark clouds in the Galactic disk, the GMCs in the CMZ are exposed to dissociative\nprocesses besides photodissociation by the interstellar radiation field; they are irradiated by\nstrong ultraviolet (UV) radiation from OB-stars (G0 \u223c 103 ; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2004)\nand are possibly exposed to enhanced cosmic-ray/X-ray ionization and dissociative shocks.\nTherefore, in addition to the time-dependent chemical model, we discuss these possible\nexplanations for C0 overabundance in the following sections.\n\n4.1.1. Photodissociation\nIn terms of the stationary PDR model (Hollenbach, Takahashi & Tielens 1991) high\nNC0 /NCO ratio can be attributed to an intense UV field; NCO decreases with increasing UV\nfield strength (G0 ) whereas NC0 is insensitive to G0 . However, G0 for M\u22120.02\u22120.07 is not\nremarkably higher than that for other GMCs adjacent to H II regions. The [C II] 2 P3/2 \u20132 P1/2\nintensity of M\u22120.02\u22120.07, which is a good measure of G0 , is 8 \u00d7 10\u22124 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 str\u22121\n(Poglitcsh et al. 1991). This value is within the range of typical values for regions outside\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nM-0.02-0.07\n\nM-0.13-0.08\n\nFig. 5.- Longitude-velocity diagrams of N2 H+ , [C I], and T[CI] /T13 CO ratio in Sgr A at\nb = \u22120.076\u25e6 . Contours of the N2 H+ intensity are drawn at 1 K intervals beginning from 1.5\nK.\nSgr A, (0.6\u20131) \u00d7 10\u22123 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 str\u22121 (Mizutani et al. 1994). A similar [C II] intensity is\nalso observed for the Radio Arc and Sgr B1 regions (Mizutani et al. 1994), where no [C I]\nenhancement is observed in our data sets.\nIn addition, the spatial distribution of the [C I] emission deviates from the stationary\nPDR model. The [C I] peak of a photodissociative origin is expected to appear at the\ncloud surface (Hollenbach, Takahashi & Tielens 1991; Kamegai et al. 2003) rather than at\nthe cloud center. However, this does not correspond to the observed distribution of the\n[C I] emission shown in Fig.4. The strong [C I] emission originates from a ridge from\n(l, b) = (0\u25e6 , \u22120.03\u25e6 ) to (\u22120.05\u25e6 , \u22120.1\u25e6 ), coinciding with the 13 CO ridge. The [C I] ridge\ndoes not show a significant positional offset from the 13 CO ridge toward either of the two\ndominant UV sources, the Central cluster and the G\u22120.02\u22120.07 H II region.\n\n4.1.2. Cosmic-ray/X-ray Ionization\nChemical models show that a high ionization rate due to cosmic-rays or X-rays increases\nC abundance (Flower et al. 1994; Meijerink, Spaans, & Israel 2006). In fact, very high\nNC0 /NCO ratios (& 1) are found for the central regions of starburst galaxies and active\nnuclei (Israel & Baas 2002; Hitschfeld et al. 2008) and for GMCs interacting with supernova\nremnants (SNRs) (White 1994; Arikawa et al. 1999), where high cosmic-ray/X-ray flux is\nexpected.\n0\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nM\u22120.02\u22120.07 is located near Sgr A\u2217 , which is considered as a possible source of cosmicrays in the CMZ (Chernyakova et al. 2011). It is also argued that Sgr A\u2217 underwent a strong\nX-ray outburst in the recent past (Koyama et al. 1996). In addition, M\u22120.02\u22120.07 interacts\nwith the Sgr A-East SNR (Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2001), which is another possible cosmic-ray\nsource in the Sgr A region. The cosmic-ray/X-ray dissociation by these sources may explain\nthe high C0 abundance in M\u22120.02\u22120.07. An advantage of the cosmic-ray/X-ray dissociation\nmodel over the standard PDR model is that it can explain the spatial co-existence of the\n13\nCO and [CI] emissions more easily, because the X-rays and cosmic-rays can penetrate\ndeeper into a cloud than UV photons.\n\n4.1.3. Mechanical Dissociation\nPropagation of a fast shock thorough dense molecular gas can dissociate CO in the post\nshock gas (Hollenbach & McKee 1980). White (1994) suggested that the very high C0 /CO\nratio (1.3\u20132.9) for the IC443C C-shocked region can be attributed to the blast wave from\nthe SNR, or to the enhanced cosmic-ray flux in the SN-shocked region.\nThe dissociative shock from Sgr A-East may provide an alternative explanation for\nthe high C0 /CO ratio, especially at the Galactic northern and western edge of the SNR\nshell where the shape of the [C I]-enhanced region spatially correlates well with that of the\nSNR (Fig.4b). Another possible source of the dissociative shock is cloud-cloud collision.\nIt is suggested that cloud-cloud collision is rather frequent in the CMZ because of the high\nvolume filling factor of molecular clouds and the presence of a bar-potential (Hasegawa et al.\n1994; H\u00fcttemeister et al. 1998).\n\n4.1.4. Time Dependent Chemistry\nThe high C0 abundance of M\u22120.02\u22120.07 can be also explained by time-dependent chemical models. The models of Suzuki et al. (1992), Lee et al. (1996), and Bergin et al. (1997)\nshowed that molecular clouds are C0 -abundant for \u223c 1 Myr after their formation. Hence,\nM\u22120.02\u22120.07 region can be understood as a young molecular cloud similar to the [C I]-rich\ncloud in the Taurus region (Maezawa et al. 1999).\nIn fact, the [C I]-enhanced region in M\u22120.02\u22120.07 appears spatially separated from the\nevolved, star-forming dense core region of the cloud. In Fig.5, the distribution of the [C I]\nemission is compared to that of the N2 H+ J=1\u20130 line (Oka et al. private communication),\nwhich is a tracer of evolved dense cores. M\u22120.02\u22120.07 is remarkably weak in N2 H+ as\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\ncompared to the neighboring GMC, M\u22120.13\u22120.08; the N2 H+ J=1\u20130/H13 CN J=1\u20130 ratio for\nM\u22120.02\u22120.07 is 0.59, which is two times lower than that in M\u22120.13\u22120.08, 1.1 (Oka et al.\nprivate communication). Further, we note a negative spatial correlation between [C I] and\nN2 H+ in the internal structure of M\u22120.02\u22120.07. The [C I] peak velocity of M\u22120.02\u22120.07\nis 50\u201365 km s\u22121 , whereas the N2 H+ peak velocity is 45\u201350 km s\u22121 . The T[CI] /T13 CO ratio\nat the N2 H+ peak is 0.54, which is significantly lower than that averaged over the entire\ncloud. Since N2 H+ becomes abundant in the later phase (& 1 Myr) of chemical evolution\n(Hirahara et al. 1995; Bergin et al. 1997), the observed negative spatial correlation between\nN2 H+ and [C I] is consistent with the chemical evolution scenario.\n\n4.2.\n\nMass Inflow in the CMZ\n\nIf the [C I]-enhanced region in M\u22120.02\u22120.07 is a young molecular cloud with an age not\nmuch greater than the chemical timescale of C0 \u2192CO conversion, supply of a large amount\nof diffuse gas in the past \u223c 1 Myr would be required for its formation. From the mass of\nM\u22120.02 \u2212 0.07 (\u223c 105 M\u2299 ; Zylka, Mezger & Wink 1990), the supply rate is estimated as\n\u223c 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is within a reasonable range that could be explained by the mass\ninflow rates specified in the literature. Morris & Serabyn (1996) estimated the inflow rate\nto be 0.1\u20131 M\u2299 yr\u22121 at \u223c 200 pc from the Galactic Center. Namekata et al. (2009) argued\nthat M\u22120.02\u22120.07 is a part of a gas disk formed by the mass inflow to the central \u223c 15 pc\nregion driven by the inner bar potential. The mass inflow rate estimated by their model is\n\u223c 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , which is also in good agreement with our estimate.\nThe high T[CI] /T13 CO ratio for the 180-pc ring can be also explained in the framework of\nthe bar-driven inflow model. Binney et al. (1991) showed that the 180-pc molecular ring is\nformed by shock compression of the atomic gas at the inner edge of the innermost x1 orbit\nand that the molecular gas rapidly flows into the inner x2 orbits. The residence time of the\nmolecular gas in the ring is shorter than the orbital period of the ring, \u2243 \u03c0 Rring /Vring \u223c\n6 Myr, where Rring and Vring are the radius and the rotational velocity of the ring, respectively.\nThis timescale is comparable to, or slightly longer than the chemical timescale of C0 \u2192 CO\nconversion, and hence a considerable fraction of the molecular gas in the ring may be C0 abundant.\nHowever, we note that it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion about the origin of the\n[C I]-enhanced regions because of the complexity of the Galactic Center environment. As\ndiscussed in the previous subsections, cosmic-ray/X-ray dissociation or the mechanical dissociation of CO in the pre-existing molecular clouds can also provide reasonable explanations\nfor the high NC0 /NCO ratio. For the 180-pc ring, we should also consider the possibility that\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nthe high [C I]/13 CO intensity ratio may not be due to the high C0 abundance but to the low\n13\nC isotopic abundance.\n\n4.3.\n\nCND and CO+0.02\u22120.02\n\nThe CND has the highest T[CI] /T13 CO ratio of the clouds in our data sets, although we\ncould not confirm the increase in its C0 abundance. Oka et al. (2011) found the CND has\nlow N2 H+ abundance, similar to M\u22120.02\u22120.07. This result, along with the high T[CI] /T13 CO\nratio, suggests similarities in the chemical composition of these clouds.\nThe T[CI] /T13 CO ratio of 2.0 for CO+0.02\u22120.02 is considerably higher than that for\nM\u22120.02\u22120.07. The large velocity width of CO+0.02\u22120.02 indicates that the cloud is violently shocked, although the driving source of the shock is not identified. Oka et al. (2008)\nargued that the energetic internal motion of CO+0.02\u22120.02 is driven by a series of SN explosions. The effect of the shock dissociation, and possibly of cosmic-ray dissociation enhanced\nby the SN-shock, may be more important for C+0.02\u22120.02 than for M\u22120.02\u22120.07.\n\n5.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe report the discovery of molecular clouds with high C0 abundance in the CMZ. We\nfound that the T[CI] /T13 CO ratio significantly increased for M\u22120.02\u22120.07, CO+0.02\u22120.02,\nthe CND, and the 180-pc ring, as compared to that for the bulk component of the CMZ.\nThe NC0 /NCO ratio of 0.47 for M\u22120.02\u22120.07 is approximately twice the CMZ average.\nWe could not draw a definite conclusion on the origin of the high NC0 /NCO ratio because of the complexity of the Galactic Center environment. We propose cosmic-ray/X-ray\nionization and mechanical dissociation by fast shock as possible explanations. We also hypothesize that the [C I]-enhanced regions in M\u22120.02\u22120.07 and the 180-pc ring are young\nmolecular clouds with ages not greater than the chemical timescale of C0 \u2192CO conversion.\nSuch young, massive molecular clouds were possibly formed by the bar-induced mass inflow\nin the Galactic Center region.\n\nREFERENCES\nArikawa et al. 1999, Proceedings of Star Formation 1999, held in Nagoya, Japan, June 21 25, 99\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nBergin, E., Goldsmith, P.
