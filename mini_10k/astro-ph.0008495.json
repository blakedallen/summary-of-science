Tytler and his collaborators have\nnow determined deuterium abundances for three\nclouds and derived upper limits for a number of\nother clouds [6,7]. Based upon these and other\nresults we infer a primeval deuterium abundance,\n(D/H)P = (3.0\u00b10.4)\u00d710\u22125 (95% C.L.), which leads\nto a precision determination of the baryon density\n[8]:\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the determination of its solar system abundance by the Apollo astronauts almost thirty years\nago, deuterium has been used to constrain the density of ordinary matter [1,2]. The reason is simple:\nbig-bang deuterium production has a strong dependence upon the baryon density (\u221d \u03c1\u22121.6\n), and asB\ntrophysical processes since have only destroyed deuterium [3].\nUntil recently, deuterium was used to set an upper\nlimit to the baryon density (around 10% of critical\ndensity), based upon the fact that the big bang must\nproduce at least the amount of deuterium seen in\nthe local interstellar medium (ISM). Together with\nmeasurements of the abundances of the other light\nelements produced in the big bang, a concordance\ninterval for the baryon density was derived, 0.007 \u2264\n\u03a9B h2 \u2264 0.024 [4]. For two decades the big-bang\nnucleosynthesis (BBN) baryon density has stood as\nthe best determination of the amount of ordinary\nmatter and the linchpin in the case for nonbaryonic\ndark matter [5].\n\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.020 \u00b1 0.002 (95% C.L.).\n\n(1)\n\n\u03a9B is the fraction of critical density contributed\nby baryons, h = H0 /100 km sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and\nthe physical baryon density \u03c1B = 1.878(\u03a9B h2 ) \u00d7\n10\u221229 g cm\u22123 .\nA key test of the BBN prediction, and indeed\nthe consistency of the standard cosmology itself, lies\nahead. Measurements of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy on small angular scales\ncan ultimately determine the baryon density to an\naccuracy of around 1%. The physics involved is\nvery different: gravity-driven acoustic oscillations\n1\n\n\fof the photon-baryon fluid when the Universe was\naround 500 000 years old. The first step toward\nthis important goal was taken recently when the\nBOOMERANG and MAXIMA CMB experiments\nreported results for the baryon density: \u03a9B h2 =\n0.032+0.009\n\u22120.008 (95% C.L.) [9]. At about the 2\u03c3 level,\nthis independent measure of the amount of ordinary\nmatter agrees with the BBN prediction and supports\nthe longstanding BBN argument for non-baryonic\ndark matter.\nThe CMB determination of the baryon density\nshould improve dramatically over the next few years,\nmaking a very precise comparison of the two methods possible. The difference between the BBN and\nCMB baryon densities has already triggered lively\ndiscussion in the literature [10]. Motivated by this,\nwe have written this paper to explain the BBN prediction for the baryon density and the associated\nuncertainties.\n\nII. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PREDICTED\nDEUTERIUM ABUNDANCE\n\nThe standard scenario for big-bang nucleosynthesis begins with the assumptions of (i) the\nisotropic and homogeneous Friedmann-RobertsonWalker (FRW) cosmology, (ii) three massless (or\nvery light) neutrino species, (iii) zero (or very small)\nchemical potentials for the neutrino species, and (iv)\nspatial homogeneity of the baryon density. Within\nthe standard theory, the predictions for the lightelement abundances depend only upon the baryon\ndensity (more precisely, baryon-to-photon ratio) and\nthe dozen nuclear-reaction rates that enter the calculation.\nEssentially all of these rates have been measured\nat energies relevant for BBN, and because large numbers of measurements exist for most of the cross sections, reliable estimates of the uncertainties can be\nmade (see Fig. 1). We have used all the extant nuclear data to estimate directly the uncertainties in\nthe BBN predictions [11,12]. We integrated the nuclear data over thermal distributions to obtain thermally averaged rates. Then, uncertainties in the predictions were estimated by a Monte Carlo method,\nrepeatedly calculating the abundances with individual cross-section data being varied according to their\nquoted experimental uncertainties (also accounting\nfor correlated normalization errors). From the resulting distribution of predicted abundances we have\nderived the uncertainties.\n\nFIG. 1. Cross-section data and fits for one of the processes important for determining the BBN deuterium\nyield. Solid curves indicate best-fit and 95% C.L. limits from our Monte Carlo method [11,12]; broken curves\nindicate the corresponding best-fit and 95% C.L. curves\nfrom earlier work [13]. The bracket at the bottom indicates the energy range where this cross section is needed\nin order to compute all light-element abundances to an\naccuracy of one-tenth of their current uncertainties.\n\nFIG. 2. D/H uncertainties (from left to right): measured D/H [6], uncertainty estimated by SKM [13],\nour Monte Carlo uncertainty, and uncertainties arising\nfrom the individual reactions, all at 95% C.L. and for\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.020.\n\n2\n\n\fThe uncertainty in the D/H prediction around\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.020 arises mainly from the reactions\nd(d, n)3 He, d(p, \u03b3)3 He, and p(n, \u03b3)d, with a smaller\ncontribution from d(d, p)t (see Fig. 2). The total uncertainty from all of these combined is 5.4% at 95%\nC.L., and increases slightly for larger \u03a9B h2 . Combining this with the slope of the power-law dependence of D/H on baryon density, we obtain a nuclear\ncontribution to the uncertainty in the deuteriumderived baryon density of 3.4% (95% C.L.).\nWe end this discussion with two comments. First,\nBBN actually determines the baryon-to-photon ratio when the Universe was about 100 seconds old,\n\u03b7 = (5.6 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u221210 (95% C.L.); to translate this\ninto a baryon density today two things are needed:\n(i) average mass per baryon; and (ii) the assumption of adiabatic expansion since BBN [14]. At the\n1% level, the average mass per baryon depends upon\nchemical composition; for the post-BBN primordial\nmix or universal solar abundance, m\u0304 = 1.670 \u2212\n1.671 \u00d7 10\u221224 g. Adiabatic expansion since BBN is\na feature of the standard cosmology. With these\nassumptions, \u03a9B h2 = (3.650 \u00b1 0.008) \u00d7 107 \u03b7 (95%\nC.L.), where the error comes from the uncertainty in\nthe CMB temperature, T = (2.725 \u00b1 0.002) K (95%\nC.L.) [15].\nThe second comment is an explanation of why\nour estimates of the light-element uncertainties are\nabout a factor of two to three smaller than the previous very thorough study by Smith et al. (SKM)\n[13] in 1993. Some of it is simply improved measurements. However, the bulk of the difference involves\ntechnique. As described, our analysis used all the\ndata directly, each data point weighted by its error\nbar. SKM estimated 2\u03c3 limits to cross sections by\nconstructing envelopes (motivated by theory) forced\nto contain most of the measurements, and then from\nthese, derived overall rate uncertainties. Although\nmuch simpler to implement, this technique gives too\nmuch weight to experiments with large error bars\nand to cross-section data in energy intervals that\nare not as important to BBN, and results in unnecessarily conservative error estimates.\n\nfeature is isotopically shifted by 82 km/s to the blue\n(see Fig. 3). Successfully implementing this idea\nawaited the advent of the 10-meter Keck telescope\nand its HIRES spectrograph [17]. At present, four\nabsorbing gas clouds place stringent constraints on\nthe primeval deuterium abundance, and another five\nprovide independent consistency checks. Here we\nbriefly summarize the state of the observations, and\ndiscuss possible systematics. For a detailed review,\nsee Ref. [6].\nThe technique is simple and straightforward; the\nrelative abundances of deuterium and hydrogen are\nmeasured through absorption profile fitting of the\nLyman series. In these clouds of virtually primordial\nmaterial (metal abundance less than 1% of solar),\nthe relative column densities of neutral deuterium\nand neutral hydrogen yield the primeval D/H ratio\nwithout correction for ionization or destruction of\ndeuterium by stars [27]. The major obstacle is the\ndiscovery of systems that are suitable for deuterium\ndetection. To observe the weak deuterium feature,\nthe neutral hydrogen column density must exceed\nabout 1017 cm2 , and such clouds are relatively rare.\nThe current rate of success is approximately 4 suitable clouds per 100 quasars studied. (Note, for each\nhigh-redshift quasar there are hundreds of intervening gas clouds, but typically only one with sufficiently high column density to see deuterium.)\nThere are three systems at z > 2.5 where deuterium has been detected: D/H = (3.3 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22125\n[18]; (4.0 \u00b1 1.4) \u00d7 10\u22125 [19] and 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 [7] (95%\nC.L.). The third and newest system has a much\nhigher hydrogen column density, and deuterium is\nseen in Lyman-\u03b2, \u03b3, 5, 6, and 7. A fourth system\nprovides a strong upper limit: D/H < 6.7 \u00d7 10\u22125\n(95% C.L.) [20].\nUsing the likelihood distributions for the first two\ndetections and a gaussian likelihood for the new detection, we infer (D/H)P = (3.0 \u00b1 0.4) \u00d7 10\u22125 (95%\nC.L.). We note that the dispersion of the three detections is somewhat larger than one might expect\nbased upon the estimated error of the mean, though\nnot unreasonably so: The reduced \u03c72 = 7.1 for two\ndegrees of freedom has a probability of 3%.\nAnother five extragalactic absorbers that give limits on D/H at high redshift have been analyzed\n[21,22]. They add no weight to the D/H determination, but are all consistent with (D/H)P = 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nFig. 4 summarizes the deuterium detections and upper limits.\n\nIII. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE OBSERVED\nDEUTERIUM ABUNDANCE\n\nIn 1976 Adams [16] pointed out that the primordial abundance of deuterium could be determined by\nobservations of Lyman-series absorption of quasar\nlight by intervening high-redshift (z > 2.5) clouds\nof pristine gas, by using the fact that the deuterium\n3\n\n\fdensity, and velocity dispersion as well as the intrinsic value of D/H. Here, we present an a posteriori\nestimate of the probability for hydrogen contamination at the level of 10% or more in each system. In\nthe three absorption systems with detections, the a\npriori probability for 10% contamination is: 0.007,\n0.01 and 0.001 respectively, assuming that the interloper must fall within 5 km/s of the expected position of deuterium absorption. (Because of its very\nhigh hydrogen column density, the third system is\nparticularly immune to the possibility of an interloper.) Multiplying these a priori probabilities by\nthe number of clouds searched (about 25), we arrive at estimates for the a posteriori probabilities,\n0.18, 0.25, 0.03 respectively. The final joint probability that all three systems are contaminated by\nmore than 10% is less than 0.1%.\nThis small probability, and the consistency of the\nthree deuterium detections, argues strongly for deuterium detections rather than hydrogen interlopers.\nOne can attempt to correct for hydrogen contamination by assuming a flat prior for contamination of 0\nto 10% in the lower column-density systems, Q1009\nand Q1937. The likelihood for (D/H)P , in this case,\nhas a central value that is 3% lower and an uncertainty that is slightly (20%) larger. This analysis\nfurther suggests that contamination by interlopers\nis not a significant systematic; further, allowing for\nthis small contamination lessens the possible significance of the larger than expected scatter in the derived deuterium abundances.\n\nFIG. 3. Spectrum of Q1937-1009; blueward of the\ncharacteristic Lyman-\u03b1 emission line of the quasar is the\n\"forest\" of Lyman-\u03b1 absorption due to the hundreds of\nintervening gas clouds. The lower panel shows a blowup\nof the region around the deuterium detection, a cloud at\nredshift z = 3.572, and the model fit.\n\nEarlier claims of a factor of ten higher deuterium\nabundance in an absorption cloud associated with\nQ0014+8118 [23] were shown to be a result of\nmisidentification of the putative deuterium feature\n[24]. The aforementioned upper-limit systems also\nargue strongly against high deuterium. In addition,\nrecent analyses of a low redshift system suggestive\nof high D/H [25,26] are unconvincing due to lack of\nspectral coverage of the entire Lyman series.\nAlthough the technique is simple and direct, there\nare two important sources of systematic uncertainty.\nThe first arises from \"hydrogen interlopers,\" low\ncolumn-density gas clouds that are coincidentally\nsituated to mimic deuterium absorption [22,26\u201328].\nInterlopers result in a one-sided systematic bias\nwhich can lead to an overestimation of D/H. Absorbing clouds are ubiquitous at high redshifts [29]\nand the chance probability of an interloper is nonnegligible.\nThe probability of an interloper depends on many\nfactors, including redshift, neutral hydrogen column\n\nFIG. 4. Summary of deuterium detections and upper\nlimits as a function of the hydrogen column density (all\nat 95% C.L.). The diagonal line indicates the minimum\ndeuterium abundance that could be detected as a function of hydrogen column density. Note that the newest\nsystem lies well above the detection threshold.\n\n4\n\n\fprocesses since BBN have only destroyed deuterium.\nThis is in stark contrast to the abundance of heavy\nelements (around 2%) which indicates about half the\nmaterial has been processed through stars, and thus\nimplies a primeval deuterium abundance of about\n3 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Further, the D/H prediction at \u03a9B h2 =\n0.03 is also lower than the abundance inferred for\nthe pre-solar nebula, (D/H)= (2.1\u00b11.0)\u00d710\u22125 (95%\nC.L.) [34].\nThe predicted 7 Li abundance is about six times\nthat measured in the atmospheres of old pop II halo\nstars, (7 Li/H)= [1.7 \u00b1 0.1 (95%C.L.) \u00b1 0.2 (syst)] \u00d7\n10\u221210 [35]. While there is lively debate about the\npossible depletion of 7 Li in these stars (by rotationally driven mixing and convective burning), there is\na consensus that any such depletion must be less\nthan about a factor of two [36]. Thus, 7 Li too is a\nserious problem for this baryon density.\nFinally, though there is no consensus about the\nprimeval abundance of 4 He, and discussion continues about possible systematic error, YP = 0.250 is\ninconsistent with the two largest compilations of 4 He\nmeasurements. The primordial 4 He abundances inferred from these two studies of metal-poor, extragalactic Hii regions are: YP = 0.244 \u00b1 0.004 [37] and\nYP = 0.234 \u00b1 0.004 [38], both at 95% C.L.\n\nThe other important source of systematic error\ninvolves model fitting of absorption line profiles in\nquasar spectra. A small number of Voigt profiles\nwere used to model the deuterium absorption systems [18,19]. The effect of model-parameter choice\nhas been studied extensively in the measurement of\nD/H at high redshift [22,30], as well as in the local interstellar medium [31,32]. Including the uncertainty\nof the unabsorbed quasar continuum, the estimated\npossible systematic bias is at the level of 5%. This\nbias could affect all sightlines, but it should have a\ndifferent magnitude and direction from one system\nto the next.\nFinally, it has been argued that astrophysical\nmechanisms that significantly alter the deuterium\nabundance in these clouds are implausible [27]; the\nrelatively small intrinsic scatter allowed by the current data argues against any significant post-BBN\nproduction or destruction, as more scatter would\nbe expected. This argument is weaker than those\nabove, since there could be some real scatter in the\ndata.\n\nIV. WHY BBN CANNOT ACCOMMODATE\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.03\n\nBecause the uncertainty associated with the CMB\nbaryon density is significant (about 15%), there is\nnothing special about the central value, \u03a9B h2 =\n0.032. Nonetheless, it is interesting and instructive to ask if BBN could accommodate such a high\nvalue. The answer is a resounding no for three\nreasons: D, 7 Li and 4 He, in that order. For a\nbaryon density of \u03a9B h2 = 0.03, the predicted abundances are: (D/H)= (1.6 \u00b1 0.12) \u00d7 10\u22125 ; (7 Li/H)\n= (8.5 \u00b1 0.7) \u00d7 10\u221210 ; and YP = 0.251 \u00b1 0.001 (95%\nC.L.). All three conflict significantly with observations.\nAside from high-redshift hydrogen clouds, the\nmost precise determination of the deuterium abundance is that measured with the HST for the local\nISM, (D/H)= (1.5\u00b10.2)\u00d710\u22125 (95% C.L.) [31]. The\ntechnique is the same, except on a smaller scale: absorption by clouds of neutral gas along the lines of\nsight to many nearby stars is measured. (Variations\nin the local D/H, both upward and downward, have\nbeen reported and may be statistically significant\n[32,33]. If real, they probably reflect the inhomogeneity of the local ISM.) The ISM value for D/H is\nessentially equal to the predicted primordial abundance for \u03a9B h2 = 0.03 and would imply that the\nlocal ISM is pristine material, because astrophysical\n\nV. A VERY CONSERVATIVE RANGE FOR\nTHE BBN BARYON DENSITY\n\nWe believe our stated range for the BBN baryon\ndensity, \u03a9B h2 = 0.020 \u00b1 0.002 (95% C.L.) is well\njustified. However, two recent reviews have quoted\nbroader 95% C.L. intervals: 0.015 \u2264 \u03a9B h2 \u2264 0.023\n[39] and 0.004 \u2264 \u03a9B h2 \u2264 0.021 [40]. The differences are simple to explain: The first review [39]\nused the older SKM analysis for the error in the\npredicted deuterium abundance (see Fig. 2). The\nsecond review [40] still allows for the possibility that\nthe primeval D/H is as large as 3 \u00d7 10\u22124 . As described above, we believe the case for high primeval\nD/H is simply no longer tenable.\nThe question remains, just how high can the\nbaryon density be pushed. To answer that question and obtain a \"very conservative range\" for the\nbaryon density, we revert to the older, more conservative SKM analysis of the input nuclear data \u2013\nthough unlikely, our Monte Carlo analysis could be\ndriven by an experiment with understated errors \u2013\nand use a very conservative range for the primeval\ndeuterium abundance, (D/H)P = (2.1 \u2212 3.9) \u00d7 10\u22125.\nThis range for the primeval deuterium abundance\n5\n\n\fis well justified (our very conservative range is only\ntwice as broad). As more deuterium systems are discovered and analyzed, the uncertainty will shrink.\nEven without improvement in the nuclear data, a\nprecision of about 4% (at 95% C.L.) is possible.\nOn the other hand, CMB anisotropy measurements have just recently achieved sufficient angular\nresolution to probe the baryon density. The first\nresult, a 15% determination of the baryon density,\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.032+0.009\n\u22120.008 , is encouraging. It supports the\nlongstanding BBN argument for nonbaryonic dark\nmatter and agrees with the BBN baryon density at\nabout the 2\u03c3 level. It is important to note that\nthe CMB results for \u03a9B h2 depend upon the number\nof free cosmological parameters used in the analysis\nand the priors assumed for them [10]. The CMB determination will improve significantly over the next\nfew years as more experiments probe the sub-degree\nangular scales, making a more robust comparison\nwith the BBN prediction possible.\nAs we have emphasized, there are three good reasons why BBN cannot tolerate \u03a9B h2 = 0.03: the\npredicted abundances of D, 7 Li and 4 He; all would\nconflict significantly with observed abundances. The\nstandard cosmology and standard BBN cannot \u2013 and\nprobably will not have to \u2013 accommodate a baryon\ndensity this large.\nShould future CMB measurements zero in on a\nbaryon density higher than our extreme upper limit,\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.026, they would, in our opinion, implicate\nnonstandard cosmology or BBN. Among the possibilities are: large neutrino chemical potentials [41],\nentropy reduction since BBN due to exotic physics\n[14], a decaying tau neutrino [42], neutrino oscillations [43], or the inconsistency of the standard cosmology. At the moment, none of these possibilities\nare particularly compelling, and we will wait to see\nif they are necessary.\n\nis derived from a weighted average of the three detections, with the error of the mean being estimated\nfrom the standard deviation of the three detections\nusing the standard formula. By so doing, we are\nin effect disregarding the estimated errors for the\nindividual measurements, and instead using the dispersion of the measured values to estimate the error\nof the mean. If the statistical errors are larger than\nestimated or if there are unknown systematic errors,\nthis approach might more accurately reflect the underlying errors. (We note that O'Meara et al. [7],\nmotivated by the larger than expected dispersion of\nthe three detections, have advocated a similar approach for estimating the uncertainty in the primeval\ndeuterium abundance.)\nAdding the theoretical and observational uncertainties discussed above in quadrature, we obtain a\nvery conservative range for the BBN baryon density: \u03a9B h2 = 0.016 \u2212 0.026, which is about twice\nthe width of what we believe to be a well justified 95% confidence interval. Precisely because this\nvery conservative range is predicated upon the possibility of systematic error, or error that is not well\nquantified by a Gaussian distribution function, we\nhave not assigned a confidence level to it. We also\nnote that at the upper limit of this extreme range,\n\u03a9B h2 = 0.026, all the light-element abundances,\n(D/H)P = 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 , (7 Li/H)= 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221210 and\nYP = 0.249, are uncomfortably different from their\ninferred values.\nVI. CONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nA flood of high-precision data \u2013 from CMB measurements to very large redshift surveys to precision D/H determinations \u2013 is transforming cosmology. Soon, no one will remember a time when the\nphrase precision cosmology was an oxymoron. The\nnew data are testing our most promising ideas about\nthe early Universe as well as the consistency of the\nbig-bang framework itself. A comparison between\nthe BBN and CMB baryon densities will be one of\nthe most important consistency tests.\nThe use of BBN to determine the baryon density\nis a mature subject. The predictions have been scrutinized and the required nuclear data are measured\nat the relevant energies. The determination of the\ndeuterium abundance in nearly pristine high-redshift\ngas clouds now involves nine systems, and considerable attention has been paid to systematic error.\nWhile our stated uncertainty in the BBN baryon\ndensity is small, \u03a9B h2 = 0.020\u00b10.002 (95% C.L.), it\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the DOE (at Chicago\nand Fermilab) and by the NASA (at Fermilab by\ngrant NAG 5-7092).
