[1].\nA crucial quantity in the derivation of the DR (see Eq. (8)\nin Ref. [1]) is the thermo-mechanical noise, expressed by\nthe spectral density of the displacement noise (on resonance \u03c90 ) given by (see Eq. (7) in Ref. [1]),\nSx = 4kB T\n\nQ\n,\nm\u03c903\n\n(1)\n\nwhich is based on the classical equipartition law (kB T \u226b\nh\u0304\u03c90 ) and on the classical fluctuation-dissipation theorem (CFDT). However, since the systems discussed in\nRef. [1] will be driven at low temperatures (see the ratios\nof h\u0304\u03c90 /(kB T ) in Table I) quantum fluctuations should be\ntaken into account in the thermo-mechanical noise. The\nmost direct way to include the quantum noise is to substitute the thermal energy kB T by the thermally averaged\nquantum energy including the zero point energy contribution (following Callen and Welton [2]). Employing the\nquantum fluctuation-dissipation theorem (QFDT), the\nexpression for the spectral density of the displacement\nh\u0304\u03c90 /(kB T )\n\nl = 200nm\n\nl = 100nm\n\nl = 50nm\n\nl = 25nm\n\nSWNT\n0.008 (0.024) 0.03 (0.098) 0.13 (0.39) 0.55 (1.57)\nMWNT\n0.06\n0.25\n0.99\n3.96\nPt nanowire\n0.03\n0.13\n0.53\n2.11\nSiC resonator\n0.57\n2.30\n9.21\n36.8\n\nTABLE I: Ratio h\u0304\u03c90 /(kB T ) for several doubly clamped resonators at 4K. The results for the SWNT are calculated with\nthe model of a solid cylinder (as in Ref. [1]) and, alternatively,\nwith the model of a hollow cylinder (see results in brackets):\ndiameter d = 1.4 nm, section area A = \u03c0dt, moment of inertia\nI = d3 t/8, and the layer spacing for graphite t = 0.34nm.\n\nFIG. 1: Dynamic range (DR) as a function of resonator length\nat (a) 4K and (b) 100mK for several doubly clamped resonators based on the classical and quantum fluctuation dissipation theorem (C/QFDT). Note the significant discrepancy\nbetween the DR based on CFDT vs. QFDT and the expected\ntemperature independence of the QFDT-results for short resonator length.\n\nnoise (again on resonance \u03c90 ) is thus given by (see Ref. [3]\nand references therein)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nQ\nh\u0304\u03c90\n.\n(2)\nSx = 2h\u0304\u03c90 coth\n2kB T m\u03c903\nIn the high temperature limit (kB T \u226b h\u0304\u03c90 ) we recover\nEq. (1) corresponding to the results of Nyquist and Johnson. Substituting Eq. (2) into the expression for the DR\n(Eq. (8) in Ref. [1]) leads to the modified DR based\non QFDT. A replot of Fig. 3 in Ref. [1] is shown in\nFig. 1, where the DR based on the CFDT and the QFDT\nare plotted as a function of the resonator length. Note\nthe significant discrepancy between the classical and the\nquantum DR in temperature and length regimes accessible by the experiment. The numerical data shown in\n\n\f2\nFig. 1 and in Table I have been computed using Eq. (9)\nand the parameters given in Table I of Ref. [1]. To reproduce Fig. 3 of Ref. [1] we, however, choose the diameter\nof the MWNT as d = 10nm and the Q-factor of the SiCbeam as Q = 4500 (as in Ref. [18] of Ref. [1]).\nIn conclusion, we have shown that the quantum\n\nfluctuation-dissipation relation poses limits on the dynamics of nanoscaled mechanical resonators and cannot\nbe neglected in a description of NEMS at low temperatures.\nC.
