Atomic\nphysics offers a domain with sufficient control of the system and isolation from noise that it has been possible to\ndo extensive experimental study of quantum entanglement [5, 6], and, therefore, it is also a productive target for\ntheoretical study of the issue as well.\nOne of the simplest scenarios for theoretically studying the dynamics of entanglement between atoms is that of two\natoms which are isolated from one another and interact with different electromagnetic fields. Studying this sort of\nmodel led to the discovery of the entanglement sudden death (SD) phenomenon [7\u201311], in which entanglement decays\nto zero in a finite time rather than asymptotically. SD has garnered significant interest because it is both unintuitive\nand potentially undesirable.\nAn alternative simple model for atom-field interaction in which to study entanglement dynamics is a Dicke model\n[12],where one assumes all atoms are grouped in a sample whose size is small compared to the resonant wavelength\n(resulting in identical coupling to every atom). However, such a simplistic model may miss the variety of behavior that\ncan result when the atoms are not confined to such a small sample. Entanglement dynamics have been shown to have a\nsignificant distance dependence when two atoms are interacting with a common field [13]. For atoms weakly interacting\nwith a continuum of field modes in the Born-Markov approximation, it has been shown [14\u201317] that changing the\natomic separation of two atoms can affect whether there is SD and whether there is revival of entanglement, as well\nas modify the dynamical generation of entanglement; in short, the qualitative features are sensitive to the atomic\nspacing. At short interatomic distance non-Markovian effects associated with induced interactions between the atoms\ndue to the quantum field become more pronounced whose qualitative behavior varies greatly with different classes of\ninitial states, as detailed in the study of [18]. So it is clear that distance dependence gives rise to a significant variety\nof behaviors, and some seemingly innocuous approximations can qualitatively alter the entanglement dynamics in\nunintuitive ways [19, 20].\nIn view of this, we seek to study entanglement dynamics in a model that is sufficiently complex to manifest some of\nthis variety of behavior yet simple enough that the dynamics may be understood in considerable detail and obtained\nwith fewer approximations. The simplest model one may pursue along this line would be two two-level atoms (2LA)\ncoupled to a single mode with couplings that reflect the distance dependence; however, as we demonstrate in Sec. II,\none needs to include at least two field modes before any non-trivial distance dependence can arise in the problem. So\nwe will study such a model with two field modes here. Out of the class of Hamiltonians that can arise from distance\ndependence, we will focus on two special cases with the aim of illustrating the variety of different behaviors that can\narise. Specifically, we will show how SD, dynamical entanglement generation, and other phenomena differ between\nthese two cases. We will also compare with the behavior of the analogous versions of the two well-studied types of\nmodels mentioned above: For two isolated atom-field systems, we will compare with the case where each system is a\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nkanu@umd.edu\nnickc@umd.edu\nblhu@umd.edu\n\n\f2\nsingle 2LA interacting with a single field mode [10, 11, 21]. In the instance of two atoms interacting with the same\nfield, we will compare with the properties of two 2LAs interacting with a single common field mode [22, 23]. We will\nshow that the entanglement dynamics in these models differs significantly from the model of two atoms interacting\nwith a two-mode field that is our focus.\nThe remainder of this article is structured as follows: In Sec. II we describe the models we use and the assumptions\nbehind them. In Sec. III we describe the quantum states of interest. In Sec. IV we describe the cases where entanglement is dynamically generated from an initially separable state and where entanglement is transferred between the\natom and the field sectors. In Sec. V we describe the cases where entanglement meets sudden death (SD) and identify\nthe conditions under which entanglement can survive. Situations in which entanglement never dies (i.e., the system is\nnever separable) we term always alive (AL). In addition to known scenarios of entanglement death, birth and revival\nwe also encounter situations where entanglement dies only for an instant (DI). The qualitative features for all the\ncases we have studied are summarized in Table I. Finally in Sec. VI we conclude with a summary and discussion.\n\nII.\nA.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nSystem Hamiltonian\n\nConsider a pair of two-level atoms (2LA) coupled via the multipolar interaction Hamiltonian to a collection of\nelectromagnetic (EM) field modes in the dipole and rotating-wave approximation [24]. The interaction Hamiltonian\nof the system in the Schr\u00f6dinger picture has the form\n\u0124I = ~\n\nXX\nj\n\n\u2217\ngj,q \u03c3\u0302j+ \u00e2q + gj,q\n\u03c3\u0302j\u2212 \u00e2\u2020q ,\n\n(1)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u03c3\u0302j+ and \u03c3\u0302j\u2212 are the raising and lowering operators for the two-level system representing the j th atom, and \u00e2\u2020q\nand \u00e2q are the creation and annihilation operators corresponding to the q th normal mode with frequency \u03c9q in some\nmode decomposition of the EM field with classical electric field mode function f q (r). If we assume the atoms to\nhave fixed center of mass positions Rj , assume that the atomic transition for each atom does not alter the angular\nmomentum of the atom, and assume the dipoles associated with all the atomic transitions have identical direction ed ,\nthen\nr\ngj,q \u2261 dj ed * f q (Rj )\n\n~\u03c9q\n,\n2\u000f0 V\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the field is quantized in a region of volume V and dj is the complex dipole matrix element for the transition in\nthe j th atom [25].\nIn general, the mode functions f q (Rj ) can be quite complicated, and even for a single atom there can be position\ndependence in the dynamics arising from the boundary conditions that the mode functions obey. In order to distinguish\nthese effects from the effect of atomic separation, we will consider traveling-wave mode functions that are solutions\nto an EM boundary value problem which is translation invariant in the coordinate separating the two atoms. For\nsimplicity, we will discuss traveling plane waves in free space, though another example would be the modes of a\ntoroidal resonator.\nHaving selected traveling plane waves as our mode decomposition, we can then choose to define them such that for\neach wave vector k one of the polarizations is perpendicular to ed , so that it does not couple to the problem and can\nbe neglected. With this assumption we know that for all remaining modes\ned * f q (Rj ) = ed \u00d7\n\nk\neikq *Rj .\nkkk\n\n(3)\n\nIn general each dj may have a different complex phase, so\narg (gj,q ) = arg (dj ) + kq * Rj .\nHowever, it turns out that, without loss of generality, one may study a much smaller set of Hamiltonians.\n\n(4)\n\n\f3\nB.\n\nEquivalent Hamiltonians\n\nGiven a particular set of complex phases for the coupling constants gj,q , one may make a trivial basis transformation\n\u00dbb =\n\nY\n\nz\n\ne\u2212i\u03bel \u03c3\u0302l /2\n\nY\n\n\u2020\n\nei\u03b6s \u00e2s \u00e2s ,\n\n(5)\n\ns\n\nl\n\nwhich simply amounts to redefining the reference for the phases of the atoms by \u03c3\u0302j+ \u2192 \u03c3\u0302j+ e\u2212i\u03bej and for the fields by\n\u00e2q \u2192 \u00e2q e\u2212i\u03b6q . After this transformation, the interaction Hamiltonian becomes\n\u0124I0 = \u00dbb \u0124I \u00dbb\u2020 = \u0124I = ~\n\nXX\n\n0\n0\ngj,q\n\u03c3\u0302j+ \u00e2q + gj,q\n\n\u0001\u2217\n\n\u03c3\u0302j\u2212 \u00e2\u2020q\n\n(6)\n\nq\n\nj\n\nwith\n0\ngj,q\n= gj,q e\u2212i\u03bej e\u2212i\u03b6q ,\n\n(7)\n\nand we may obtain the solution to the original problem by using the transformed Hamiltonian:\n0\n\n0\n\n|\u03c8 (t)i = e\u2212i\u0124I t/~ |\u03c8 (0)i = \u00dbb\u2020 e\u2212i\u0124I t/~ \u00dbb |\u03c8 (0)i \u2261 \u00dbb\u2020 e\u2212i\u0124I t/~ |\u03c8 0 (0)i .\nWe may always choose a set of phase shifts \u03bel and \u03b6s such that for some particular j and m\n\u0001\n0\narg gl,s\n= arg (dl ) + ks * Rl \u2212 \u03bel \u2212 \u03b6s = 0 if l = j or s = m\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nmaking those couplings real, but for other l and s the phase difference\narg (gl,s ) \u2212 arg (gj,q ) = arg (dl ) \u2212 arg (dj ) + ks * Rl \u2212 kq * Rj\n\n(10)\n\ncannot generally be eliminated by the added phase shifts and represents the origin of non-trivial physical distance\ndependence.\nIf we consider two identical atoms, with frequencies \u03c90 and dipole strengths |dj | = d coupled to a single EM field\nmode, then the previous paragraph implies that it suffices to consider only a Hamiltonian where both couplings are\nreal, and the atomic separation does not enter; thus, there can be no non-trivial distance dependence. However, if we\nconsider the two identical atoms coupled to two field modes, then without loss of generality we can write the total\nHamiltonian of the system as\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0124 = ~\u03c90 \u03c3\u03021\u2020 \u03c3\u03021 + \u03c3\u03022\u2020 \u03c3\u03022 + ~\u03c91 \u00e2\u20201 \u00e21 + ~\u03c92 \u00e2\u20202 \u00e22 + ~g1 \u03c3\u03021+ \u00e21 + \u03c3\u03021\u2212 \u00e2\u20201\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n+ ~g2 \u03c3\u03021+ \u00e22 + \u03c3\u03021\u2212 \u00e2\u20202 + ~g1 \u03c3\u03022+ \u00e21 + \u03c3\u03022\u2212 \u00e2\u20201 + ~g2 ei\u03c6 \u03c3\u03022+ \u00e22 + \u03c3\u03022\u2212 \u00e2\u20202 , (11)\nwhere all distance dependence arises from \u03c6 = (k2 \u2212 k1 ) * (R2 \u2212 R1 ). For simplicity, we will further assume that\n\u03c91 = \u03c92 = \u03c90 and |k1 * ed | = |k2 * ed |, which by Eq. (2) implies g1 = g2 \u2261 g. Our aim is to get a sense of the variety\nof different entanglement dynamics that can result from different separations and initial conditions. To that end, we\nwill consider two special cases, which are arguably extreme cases of the general model, \u03c6 = 0 and \u03c6 = \u03c0.\n\nC.\n\nMapping Equivalent Models and Time Evolution\n\nSince we have assumed the two field modes have the same frequency, rather than using the original modes F1 and\nF2 one could equally well choose a different mode decomposition of the field where the two modes are replaced by\nlinear combinations T F1 and T F2 with annihilation operators\n1\n\u00c21 = \u221a (\u00e21 + \u00e22 )\n2\n1\n\u00c22 = \u221a (\u00e21 \u2212 \u00e22 ) .\n2\n\n(12)\n(13)\n\n\f4\nIn the case of two modes with symmetrical coupling (TMSC), where \u03c6 = 0, the interaction Hamiltonian can then be\nwritten\nh\ni\n\u221a\n\u0124I = 2~g \u03c3\u03021+ \u00c21 + \u03c3\u03021\u2212 \u00c2\u20201 + \u03c3\u03022+ \u00c21 + \u03c3\u03022\u2212 \u00c2\u20201\n(14)\nin terms of these transformed modes, so that the atoms only couple to \u00c21 and not \u00c22 . This shows that the Hamiltonian\nis equivalent to the model of a single mode symmetrically coupled (SMSC) to two atoms. If we consider the evolution\nof the reduced density matrix of the atom \u03c1\u0302A (t) in the TMSC model it should be the same as in the SMSC model with\na properly transformed initial state. Namely, if the total system (atoms and modes) is in an initial state described by\nthe density matrix \u03c7\u0302T M SC (0), then the appropriate initial density matrix for the SMSC model is obtained by making\nthe mode transformation of Eqs. (12) and (13) and tracing out the second transformed mode T F2 .

We\nwill call this the double Jaynes-Cummings (DJC) model. This sort of model with isolated subsystems is common to\nthe study of entanglement sudden death [7, 8], and the DJC model specifically has been studied [10, 11, 21]. As in\nthe previous case, the evolution of \u03c1\u0302A (t) for the TMAC model should be the same as given by the DJC model with\nthe proper mapping of initial states.

In order to compute the concurrence, one must choose an arbitrary basis and\nconstruct the spin-flipped operator\n\u03c1\u0303 \u2261 (\u03c3\u0302y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302y ) \u03c1\u0302\u2217 (\u03c3\u0302y \u2297 \u03c3\u0302y ) ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere the star denotes the complex conjugation in that basis and \u03c3\u0302y is the Pauli matrix in the same basis. The\nconcurrence is\nn p\np\np\np o\nC (\u03c1\u0302) = max 0, \u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 \u03bb3 \u2212 \u03bb4 ,\n(23)\nwhere the \u03bbj s are the eigenvalues of the matrix \u03c1\u0302\u03c1\u0303 in decreasing order. The entanglement of formation can then be\ncomputed as\n!\n\u221a\n1 + 1 \u2212 C2\n,\n(24)\nEF (C) = h\n2\nwhere\nh (x) = \u2212x log2 (x) \u2212 (1 \u2212 x) log2 (1 \u2212 x) .\n\n(25)\n\nAlternatively, to quantify entanglement one can also use a monotone known as the negativity [27] (which quantifies\nthe degree to which the state violates the Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose condition), defined\nN (\u03c1\u0302) =\n\n\u03c1\u0302TB\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302TB is the partial transpose of the density matrix, defined by\nhj, k| \u03c1\u0302TB |l, qi \u2261 hj, q| \u03c1\u0302 |l, ki\n\n(27)\n\nin an arbitrary basis B, and k*k1 is the trace norm. Either of these approaches can be used to quantify entanglement.\nThe negativity is arguably less precise, because in some systems it can be zero even for an entangled state, but we\nwill not consider such situation. The advantage of the negativity is that it can be efficiently computed even in a large\nHilbert space. We will most often use the concurrence in this article; however, we do quantify the entanglement of\nfield states using the negativity.\n\n\f6\nIII.\n\nTHE STATES\n\nIn order to illustrate the variety of behavior that can arise among the four models we discussed in Sec. II C, we\nwill examine the entanglement dynamics of a selection of initial states in which the atoms are separable from the\nfields and which are comprised of familiar atomic and field states. In each \u221a\ncase we will select the atomic\nstate from\n\u221a\nthe set of pure states {|ggi , |eei , |egi , |\u03a6i , |\u03a8i}, where |\u03a6i \u2261 (|eei + |ggi) / 2, |\u03a8i \u2261 (|egi + |gei) / 2, and e and g\nlabel the excited and ground states of the atom respectively. The initial field state will be either the vacuum |00i, a\nproduct of Fock states |nN , mN i, a product of Glauber coherent states |\u03b1c , \u03b2c i, a product of squeezed vacuum states\n|\u03besq , \u2212\u03besq i , a two-mode squeezed vacuum state (TMSS) |\u03be, 0, 0i , a thermal state \u03c1\u0302th (with both modes having equal\ntemperature), the pure state |\u03b7nm i, or the mixed state \u03c1\u0302nm . The two-mode squeezed state is defined as the state\n\u2020 \u2020\n\u2217\nresulting from the action of the two-mode squeezing operator \u015c(\u03be) = e(\u03be \u00e21 \u00e22 \u2212\u03be\u00e21 \u00e22 ) on vacuum. The state |\u03b7nm i\nis the result of mapping the state |nN , mN i in the original modes of the TMAC problem to the transformed modes\nequivalent to the DJC problem, with\n|\u03b7nm i = \u221a\n\n1\n\nn X\nm\nX\n\n2m+n m!n! k=0 l=0\n\nn\n\nCk m Cl\n\np\n(m + n \u2212 k \u2212 l)!(k + l)!(\u22121)l |m + n \u2212 k \u2212 li |k + li ,\n\n(28)\n\nand \u03c1\u0302nm \u2261 TrT F2 [|\u03b7nm i h\u03b7nm |] is the state in the SMSC model that gives equivalent evolution to the state |nN , mN i\nin the TMSC model. n Ck represents the binomial coefficients.\nThe correspondence drawn between the TMSC-SMSC leads to the essential feature that the map for the initial\nfield states from TMSC to SMSC is many to one; the set of initial states that have the same reduced density matrix\nfor the first transformed mode T F1 have identical entanglement dynamics in terms of A1 -A2 entanglement. As a\ncounterintuitive example of this feature we will see that a squeezed state of the form |\u03besq , \u2212\u03besq , 0i and a thermal field\nin the TMSC model give the same entanglement dynamics provided the average number of photons in the thermal\nfield corresponds to that in the squeezed state (n\u0304th = sinh2 |\u03besq |).\nWe summarize our findings for the entanglement behavior given the various initial states considered in the four\nmodels in Table I, listing the equivalent TMSC-SMSC cases and TMAC-DJC cases. When discussing entanglement\nsudden death, we adopt the usage of the term as in [11] in applying it only to instances where the entanglement goes\nto zero for some time interval of non-zero length. In the case where entanglement goes to zero only for an instant\nduring the time evolution we refer to it as death for an instant (DI). If there is a non-zero entanglement at all times\nonce it is generated in the system then we label it as being \"always living\" (AL).\n\nIV.\n\nENTANGLEMENT GENERATION AND TRANSFER\n\nThe generation of entanglement from an initially separable state by the dynamics of the system is one interesting,\nand potentially useful, phenomenon to examine. In the DJC model each atom interacts only with a separate field\nmode, so the dynamics cannot increase entanglement between the two atom-field subsystems; therefore, if the atomic\nstate is not entangled initially then it will remain separable, unless there is an initial entanglement between the field\nmodes that can be transfered to the atoms by the dynamics. Knowing this, we can see that any initial field state for\nthe TMAC model that maps to a separable DJC field state will also fail to generate entanglement. The nature of the\nmapping means that even some entangled field states will fail to generate atomic entanglement in the TMAC model,\nwhile some separable states will map to an entangled DJC state and will generate entanglement.\nThis structure means that, as shown in Table I, many familiar initial field states fail to dynamically generate\nentanglement in the TMAC model. In contrast, entanglement generation is a common feature in the TMSC model\nfor the same selection of field states. For example, starting with a two-mode squeezed state in the field modes does\nnot generate any entanglement in TMAC, because the corresponding field state in DJC possesses no correlations\namongst T F1 and T F2 . On the other hand, a two-mode squeezed state in the symmetrically coupled case generates\nentanglement in the initially separable atomic states as can be seen in Fig. 1. In fact, for initial atomic states |eei\nand |ggi, if the field is sufficiently squeezed then entanglement once generated sustains forever.\nWhen considering the TMAC model with an initial field state that is a product of squeezed states |\u03besq , \u2212\u03besq i we\nfind that entanglement is dynamically generated as shown in Fig. 2. One can understand this from the fact that\nthe state |\u03besq , \u2212\u03besq i maps to the DJC model with an initial TMSS, so the generation of atomic entanglement occurs\nsimply because the dynamics transfers the entanglement between the field modes to the atoms. Further, we find that\nthere is an optimal squeezing value that generates maximal entanglement. The maxima in generated entanglement\noccur for values of the squeezing parameter such that the field state is close to being a maximally entangled qubit\nstate (\u03b10 (\u03be) |00i + \u03b11 (\u03be) |11i), with \u03b11 (\u03be) and \u03b10 (\u03be) being comparable.

Columns A-C list whether there is an entanglement generation in an initially separable atomic\nstate (yes or no). The dynamical phenomena observed in columns A-E are listed as entanglement sudden death\n(SD), entanglement dies for only an instant (DI), entanglement remains non-zero at all times and so is \"always\nliving\" (AL). A '/' denotes that both kinds of dynamics are present depending on the particular initial state chosen\nfrom within the class indicated. The initial states have been explained in Sec. III.\nthere are contributions from higher Fock states which decrease the transfer of entanglement. We also notice some\nsecondary peaks on increasing the squeezing parameter \u03besq .\nBy comparing the effects of a TMSS and thermal field state in the DJC model, one can also get some insight into\nthe role of correlations between the field modes. The reduced density matrices for individual modes correspond to a\nthermal state for both the cases; the difference being that in a TMSS the two field modes are strongly correlated with\neach other while in the thermal fields there are no correlations. One would generally expect that the correlated TMSS\ngenerates more entanglement in the atomic subsystem, which is trivially true for the case of an initially separable\natomic state. This intuition generally extends to the situation of initially entangled atomic states, where we see that\napart from the regular SD pattern in the absence of the field-field correlations there are spontaneously generated\npeaks as a result of two-mode squeezing(Fig. 3); however, we note as an exception that at certain instants of time the\nentanglement in the presence of an initial thermal field exceeds that of the TMSS. Transfer of field-field (T F1 -T F2 )\ncorrelations can be explicitly seen in a small squeezing approximation when a two mode squeezed state interacts with\nan initially separable atomic state |eei (Fig. 4). Since the probability of higher photon numbers is small, by restricting\nto the 4-dimensional subspace of lowest energy states in the Fock basis for T F1 -T F2 we obtain the negativities for the\ntwo subsystems as,\nNA1 \u2212A2 \u2248| min(s21 c21 \u2212 \u03bes21 c22 , 0)|\nNT F1 \u2212T F2\n\n\u2248| min(s21 c21\n\n\u2212\n\n(29)\n\n\u03bec21 c22 , 0)|.\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere s1 = sin( 2gt), c1 = cos( 2gt) and c2 = cos(2gt)\nIn the TMSC model, the same initial field state, consisting of a product of squeezed states, corresponds to having\na thermal field state in the SMSC model, a situation where entanglement generation has been previously studied\n[23]. Comparing the entanglement behavior in Fig. 5 for the two different couplings, we see that for the initial\natomic state |ggi there is more entanglement generated in TMAC than TMSC. As mentioned before, two thermal\nfields in TMSC also map to the same situation. This is a somewhat unintuitive situation for the generation of\nentanglement.

As had been shown in [22], in the SMSC model\nan atomic state |eei interacting with any Fock state |ni in the field mode never gets entangled.1 This then implies\nthat the atom-atom density matrix given as \u03c1\u0302(n) = TrF [|\u03c8n i h\u03c8n |] remains separable, where the time evolved state\n|\u03c8n i \u2261 \u00db |eei |ni.

Hence, any density matrix diagonal in the\nFock basis with a high component of |1i h1| would generate more entanglement in general.\nApart from the Fock state in the SMSC model with a thermal field, another example of having a initial field density\nmatrix diagonal in the Fock basis is to have a Fock state |n, mi in the TMSC which corresponds to the SMSC density\n\n\f10\n\n0.1\nExact A \u2212A entanglement\n1\n\n0.09\n\n2\n\nSmall squeezing approximation for NA\n\n2\n\nSmall squeezing approximation for NTF\n\n\u2212TF\n\n1\n\n0.07\nNegativity\n\n\u2212A\n\n1\n\n0.08\n\n2\n\n0.06\n0.05\n0.04\n0.03\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\ngt\n\n15\n\n20\n\nFigure 4: Small squeezing entanglement dynamics for a two-mode squeezed state in the DJC model interacting with\nan initially separable atomic state |eei, entanglement is generated in the atomic subsystem via transfer of field-field\ncorrelations\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\u03be=0, TMSC\n\u03be=0, TMAC\n\u03be=0.5, TMSC\n\u03be=0.5, TMAC\n\u03be=1, TMSC\n\u03be=1, TMAC\n\nConcurrence\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n\u03be=0.1, TMSC\n\u03be=0.1, TMAC\n\u03be=0.5, TMSC\n\u03be=0.5, TMAC\n\u03be=2, TMSC\n\u03be=2, TMAC\n\n0.7\n\nConcurrence\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\ngt\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\ngt\n\n(a) |egi - we observe the TMSC entanglement getting smaller (b) |ggi - TMAC shows more entanglement than TMSC, for\nas squeezing is increased, while the TMAC entanglement goes\nboth the entanglement increases and then decreases on\nto an optimum value and then decreases\nincreasing squeezing\n\nFigure 5: Comparison of entanglement generation in presence of product single mode squeezed states |\u03besq , \u2212\u03besq i for\nTMSC and TMAC\n\nmatrix\n\u03c1\u0302nm \u2261\n\nn\nm\nX\nX\n1\n\u03bamnkl |m + n \u2212 k \u2212 li hm + n \u2212 k \u2212 l|\n2m+n n!m!\n\n(30)\n\nk,p=0 l,q=0\n\nwhere \u03bamnkl = n Ck n Cp m Cl m Cq \u03b4k+l,p+q (m + n \u2212 k \u2212 l)!(k + l)!(\u22121)l . For this state again we see no entanglement\ngeneration for |eei and DI for |egi and maximal entanglement in |ggi |10i, as shown in Figs. 6e and 6f. Another\npoint we observe is that for an initial state |ggi |n, ni there is no entanglement generation, which is a common feature\nbetween TMSC and TMAC. A Fock state |n, mi in TMAC transforms into an entangled state in the DJC model, so we\nexpect and observe entanglement generation in the system for an initially separable atomic state. As an exception we\nfind that for n = m, if there is no atom-atom entanglement to begin with then the atoms remain separable evolving\n\n\f11\ninto a completely mixed state. This is counterintuitive in the sense that even though the field state in the DJC\nmodel is entangled to begin with, there is still P\nno transfer to the\np atomic subsystem. This feature can be explained by\nn\nconsidering the initial field state |\u03b7nn i = 2n1n! k=0 n Ck (\u22121)k 2k!(2n \u2212 2k)! |2n \u2212 2k, 2ki. If the atoms are initially\nin the state |eei then time evolution will lead to an entanglement of atomic and field states such that detecting whether\nthe number of photons in each mode is even or odd tells us the state of the two atoms. On tracing out the field this\ngives us a completely mixed atom-atom density matrix with no atom-atom entanglement. The same is true for the\ninitial atomic states |egi and |ggi.\nWhile there are more nuanced details in what we have reported in this section, generically speaking it seems that\nthe TMSC (and SMSC) models are much more conducive to the dynamical generation of entanglement than the\nTMAC (and DJC) model, suggesting that atomic separation may have a strong influence on this. Particularly useful\nis the ability in the TMSC to dynamically generate entanglement with a thermal field state or from a squeezed state\nin SMSC where one can even generate atomic entanglement that is AL.\n\nV.\n\nENTANGLEMENT SUDDEN DEATH AND PROTECTION\n\nThe phenomenon of entanglement sudden death has clearly provoked much theoretical interest, and it is related to\nanother question that is both interesting from a theoretical perspective and clearly of great practical importance: how\ncan one protect a system from disentanglement? Here we do not propose any active scheme for protecting entanglement\n(as in, e.g. [28]), but rather consider what initial states of the field tend to minimize the loss of entanglement or\nsafeguard entanglement once it has been dynamically generated. Of particular interest is avoiding SD.\nIn terms of the effect of the initial atomic state on the entanglement dynamics, it has been discussed previously\nin [10] for the DJC model that the initial state |\u03a6i |00i undergoes sudden death while |\u03a8i |00i has DI of the atomic\nentanglement. This differentiation in behavior is common to many of the models for studying SD in which each atom\ninteracts with a separate field [7, 8]. The same situation must occur in the TMAC case as well. In comparing these two\ninitial states for the TMSC we find a sort of reversal of roles; as Fig. 7 shows, |\u03a6i |00i enjoys non-zero entanglement\nat all times and |\u03a8i |00i still suffers DI, so now the entanglement of |\u03a6i is better preserved. This reversal also holds\nin the case of a thermal field in the TMSC model so long as the thermal average photon number is below a threshold\nvalue n\u0304crit \u2248 0.43 (Fig. 8) with the state being AL (above this critical temperature |\u03a6i experiences SD as well).\nIf one considers the TMSC model with the field modes in a two-mode squeezed state, then for the separable initial\natomic states |eei and |ggi, if the field is sufficiently squeezed, entanglement is dynamically generated and once\ngenerated sustains forever (whereas a Fock state or thermal state may generate entanglement but it goes to zero again\nat some later time). This behavior is shown in Figs. 1a and 1c. If the atoms are initially in the entangled atomic\nstate |\u03a6i, then Fig. 9 shows that in the TMSC model increasing squeezing raises the minimum value of entanglement\nprogressively towards a situation where the state is maximally entangled at all times, while for the TMAC model the\nsystem exhibits SD, and the entanglement gets destroyed in general with increasing squeezing.\nA general observation that seems to fit for most of the cases considered is that a higher average number of photons\nin the field destroys entanglement. As an exception, however, it can be seen from Fig. 10a that in the TMSC model\nwith the field in a product of coherent states, if the average number of photons is in a particular range then there is\nno SD once entanglement is generated for the states |eei and |ggi. While Fig. 10b shows that for |egi, the regular\nrule applies. In the case of the initial field being a two-mode squeezed state (Fig. 1), we observe that after a threshold\nsqueezing (or average photon number) there is no sudden death of entanglement after generation in the system when\nthe atoms are initially in the state |eei or |ggi. On the other hand, for the initial atomic state |egi entanglement\ndecreases as the average number of photons is increased.\nMuch as for generating entanglement, we find that the TMSC model is generically better suited to protecting\nentanglement from sudden death. While in the TMAC model at nonzero temperature disentanglement occurs for\nboth entangled states considered, in the TMSC we find that below a threshold temperature entanglement of the |\u03a6i\nstate remains AL. In addition, we find that in the SMSC model a two-mode squeezed vacuum field can keep |\u03a6i\nalmost maximally entangled at all times, provided squeezing is large enough. In the TMAC sudden death is a quite\ngeneric feature, which is only escaped for an initially entangled state when the field is the vacuum or a select product\nFock state.\n\nVI.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe have analyzed the entanglement dynamics in a model consisting of two two-level atoms and two electromagnetic\nfield modes for a variety of familiar field states and classified the various cases in terms of phenomena such as\ndynamical entanglement generation, entanglement sudden death.

It is useful to examine this question in a very simple model that can\nbe solved with a minimum of approximations (using which can lead to unphysical effects) and understood in detail.\nWe have argued that there is no non-trivial distance dependence in a single mode model, and, therefore, a two-mode\nmodel represents the simplest case for the study of distance dependence in the entanglement dynamics.\nWe have studied two arguably extreme cases out of the class of two-mode Hamiltonians that can arise, one in which\nthe two modes are symmetrically coupled (TMSC) to the second atom, and one where the two modes have asymmetric\ncoupling (TMAC). A useful insight in understanding these models is that the atomic dynamics in the TMSC model\ncorrespond exactly to the dynamics for a model with single field mode symmetrically coupled (SMSC) to both atoms\nwith a suitable mapping of the field state, while the atomic dynamics for the TMAC model correspond exactly to\nthe dynamics for a double Jaynes-Cummings (DJC) model, made up of two isolated subsystems each with one atom\ncoupled to one mode, under the proper transformation of the field state. These mappings help one understand the\n\n\f14\n\n1\n\n1\n\u03be=0, TMAC\n\u03be=0, TMSC\n\u03be=1, TMAC\n\u03be=1, TMSC\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\n0.8\n0.7\nConcurrence\n\nConcurrence\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0\n0\n\n\u03be=0, TMSC\n\u03be=0, TMAC\n\u03be=1, TMSC\n\u03be=1, TMAC\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\ngt\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n(a) |\u03be, 0, 0i |\u03a6i - SD for TMAC, entanglement moves towards\nmaximal entanglement in TMSC\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\ngt\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n(b) |\u03be, 0, 0i |\u03a8i - SD for both TMSC and TMAC\n\nFigure 9: Comparing entanglement dynamics for the initially entangled atomic states interacting with a two-mode\nsqueezed state and in TMSC and TMAC\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\u03b1c=1\n\n0.7\n\n\u03b1c=4\n\n\u03b1c=4\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b1c=7.5\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b1c=1\n\n0.45\n\n\u03b1c=7\n\n0.5\n\nConcurrence\n\nConcurrence\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n0.3\n\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n0.05\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ngt\n\n(a) |eei - No sudden death for a range of values of \u03b1\n\n0\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\ngt\n\n(b) |egi - Sudden death for all |\u03b1| > 0\n\nFigure 10: Entanglement generation in presence of a coherent state in SMSC\n\nsignificant differences in behavior in the two seemingly similar models, giving a window into how significantly atomic\nseparation can affect entanglement dynamics. Another significant implication of the mapping between the TMSC\nand SMSC models comes from the fact that the mapping of initial field states between those models is many-to-one\n(because it involves a partial trace); this shows us entire classes of field states for the TMSC model that will give\nexactly the same atomic dynamics. In particular, we saw that a product squeezed state can be identical to a thermal\nstate with respect to the atomic dynamics.\nIn examining the dynamical generation of entanglement from an initially separable atomic state in Sec. IV, we\nfind quite a marked contrast between the TMSC and TMAC models. While entanglement generation is a relatively\ncommon feature, present for a variety of field states, in the TMSC model, it is comparatively much more rare in the\nTMAC model. One aspect that highlights these differences is that in the TMAC model entanglement can be generated\nby a product of squeezed states or fock states, but in the TMSC model it can also be generated by more easily prepared\nstates including thermal states and product coherent states. This difference is not so surprising however, if one views\nit in terms of the mappings we have introduced to the other models. When considering that the TMAC maps to\nthe DJC model, where the two subsystems are isolated, one would expect entanglement generation to be relatively\nrare; it can only exist in cases where the field state is mapped to an entangled state whose entanglement can then\n\n\f15\nbe transferred to the atoms. With the TMSC, by contrast, we have a mapping to the SMSC model where a single\nshared field mode can readily introduce entanglement between the two atoms.\nWhen one is concerned with protecting the entanglement of two initially entangled atoms, our analysis in Sec. V\nshows that again the TMSC model is better for that purpose in most cases. In the TMAC entanglement sudden death\n(SD) is a fairly generic feature, with the initial state |\u03a8i |00i being one of only two classes we consider that does not\nshow SD; the |\u03a8i |00i shows \"death for an instant\" (DI), where entanglement goes to zero only on a finite set of points.\nThe TMSC shows a reversal of the fortunes of the |\u03a8i |00i and |\u03a6i |00i states, with the former experiencing DI while\nentanglement for the latter is AL, staying non-zero for all times. Moreover, the DI property of the dynamics of the\n|\u03a8i |00i state in the TMAC model is fragile, in the sense that it is destroyed by even the smallest departure from the\nvacuum to, for example, a finite temperature field, while for the TMSC model the AL feature of the dynamics of the\n|\u03a6i |00i state is robust, remaining for non-zero temperature below a threshold n\u0304crit ' 0.43. This gives us a condition\nfor protecting entanglement in this case.\nA different sort of issue we have touched on briefly is the role of quantum correlations between field modes in the\nentanglement dynamics of the atoms. In the DJC model we compared the resulting entanglement dynamics for fields\nin a two-mode squeezed state (TMSS) and a thermal state. For appropriate choice of the squeezing parameter, the\nTMSS has the same reduced density matrix for either mode alone as the thermal state, so in this sense these form\na pair of extreme cases to compare, one with strong quantum correlations while the other has none at all. It is\nnecessarily true in the DJC that a thermal state cannot generate entanglement, while a TMSS does. Intuition would\nalso suggest that the local entropy destroys entanglement and leads to qualitative sudden death features, while the\nentanglement generation we observe in the case of a two-mode squeezed state arises from the field-field entanglement\nbeing transferred to the atomic subsystem. The transfer of entanglement from field-field to atoms was analytically\nverified for a small squeezing approximation of the two-mode squeezed state where one can observe the field-field\nentanglement going to zero as the atom-atom entanglement builds up. For initial entangled states we would expect\nthat the correlations of the TMSS aid in maintaining the entanglement of an initially entangled state, and we find\nthis to generally be the case, although in some cases for brief periods of time a thermal state can actually result in\ngreater atomic entanglement than the corresponding squeezed states.\nAs a general result for the class of density matrices that are completely mixed in the Fock basis in SMSC case, we\nconclude that in terms of generating entanglement it is preferable to choose an initial atomic state |egi, which has\nentanglement being AL or at the least DI, as opposed to |eei where no entanglement is generated. This had been\npreviously pointed out in the case of Fock states and thermal states [22, 23].\nAs an interesting result in terms of entanglement protection, we find that a single mode squeezed state interacting\nwith symmetrically coupled atoms initially in the state |\u03a6i can be extremely effective in protecting the entanglement.\nEven for the vacuum, this entangled state is AL, but as squeezing is increased the minimum entanglement rises\nmonotonically toward maximal entanglement. For entanglement generation by a single mode squeezed state in the\nseparable atomic initial states |eei and |ggi, we found that for a sufficient amount of squeezing entanglement is not\nonly generated but remains AL for all future times. Similarly, for a single mode coherent state there is a range of\nvalues of the average photon number for which there the generated atom-atom entanglement is AL. In these cases, it\nwas observed that |egi shows sudden death as squeezing or the average photon numbers were increased.\nWe have chosen in this analysis to try to isolate the effect of atomic separation on entanglement dynamics from\nthe position-dependent effects arising from boundary conditions. For this purpose, we have assumed in Sec. II A\nan atom-field coupling that depends on the coordinate separating the atoms only by a phase factor. For clarity we\nhave supposed our two field modes are traveling-wave modes in free space, however a more experimentally relevant\nsituation would be a toroidal resonator, where there is rotational invariance in the azimuthal direction that satisfies\nour requirements. In this case the two modes of interest would be two resonant, counter-propagating whisperinggallery modes. Because strong coupling between an atom and a whispering-gallery modes of a microtoroidal resonator\nhas observed experimentally [29], there is the possibility of experimentally probing quite directly the model we have\nconsidered. However, in the experimental system there will be dissipative dynamics arising from emission into other\nmodes outside the resonator, so a detailed comparison would require either including the dissipative effects in the\ntheoretical model or a restriction to the case of sufficiently strong coupling to the resonator modes and early times\nthat the dissipation could be neglected.\nOur analysis of special cases of the entanglement dynamics arising in two atoms interacting with two modes suggests\na wide variety of different behaviors can arise, with qualitative features of the dynamics changing entirely between\nthe two cases, even with the same initial field state. This suggests that understanding the distance dependence of\nentanglement dynamics for multiple atoms interacting with a common field will be quite important for predicting\neven the qualitative features that may arise. Furthermore, if one has the practical goal of dynamically generating\nentanglement or protecting entanglement once generated, the special cases we have considered suggest that the ability\nto achieve these goals will be greatly impacted by the separation of the atoms. Having gotten some sense of the\nvariation in behavior that can arise, the obvious next step would be to quantify the entanglement dynamics over a\n\n\f16\nsignificant range of atomic separations rather than just special or extreme cases. The variety of qualitative features\nof entanglement dynamics we have illustrated here argue for the importance of these considerations.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research is supported in part by grants from the NSA-Laboratory for Physical Sciences, the DARPA-QuEST\nprogram (DARPAHR0011-09-1-0008) and the NSF-ITR program (PHY-0426696).\n\n[1] A.
