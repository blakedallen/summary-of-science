Various schemes have been proposed for transferring quantum states [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], some of which\nare based on teleportation and entanglement purification.\nOthers are more direct, having a quantum channel (typically an optical fiber) connecting the two systems, and\nclassical control pulses applied to each system ensure that\nemission from the first system and absorption by the second are perfect.\nOver long distances, it appears that protocols based\non teleportation and purification are necessarily more efficient than direct schemes [6], but over short distances\n(e.g. for interconnects between quantum components),\nthe more direct method, first proposed by Cirac et al.\n[2], may be practical, and is probably easier to implement since it does not require quantum measurement.\nThe scheme by Cirac et al. [2] implements quantum state\ntransfer from one atom located inside an optical cavity\nto another atom in a separate but connected cavity, mediated by Raman transitions via an atomic state (outside\nthe computational basis) as well as cavity and external\nphotons, and is controlled by laser pulses incident on each\natom. The transfer is therefore subject to amplitude and\nphase errors in the control pulses.\nThe idea [2] is also applicable to single-electron spin\nbased systems in semiconductors, with additional uses\nsuch as spin measurement [8, 9], and as a controllable\nsource of decoherence for initial state preparation. The\nintermediate state required for spin-flip Raman transitions between single electron spin states is a state known\nas a trion [8, 9]. This state is a bound state of two electrons and a single hole, and couples to the single electron\nspin states via x- and y-polarised light. Physically, this\ncorresponds to the optical excitation of an exciton which\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: tms29@cam.ac.uk\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic arrangement of cavity and three level\nsystem. The small circles represent Faraday isolators so the\nforward and reverse propagating paths are distinguishable.\nAdapted from Cirac et al. [2].\n\nmay form a bound state with the electron, very much\nakin to an H\u2212 complex. Trion states have been observed\nexperimentally in GaAs [10, 11], and are relatively long\nlived, and so the scheme has the potential to be realised\nin semiconductor systems.\nIn this paper we present an analysis of the effect of\ntwo possible types of stochastic error in control pulses,\nand consider a method for reducing the sensitivity of the\npulse to such errors. Our results show that it is possible\nto design pulse shapes that reduce the sensitivity of the\ntransfer process to certain sources of errors in the pulse.\nWe give a short account of the applicability of this scheme\nto a semiconductor device.\nIn section II we briefly review the proposal for quantum\nstate transfer given by [2] and give a new analytic form\nfor a laser control pulse shape that implements quantum\nstate transfer. In section III we formulate a master equation for the transfer subject to stochastic errors in the\ncontrol pulse, and use the master equation to compute\nthe sensitivity of the transfer process to such errors. In\nsection IV we present a procedure to optimise the pulse\nshape to reduce the sensitivity of the transfer to control\npulse errors. We then finish with some conclusions.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nQUANTUM STATE TRANSFER\nA.\n\nReview of proposal\n\nIn Cirac et al.'s proposal for quantum state transfer,\n[2], two 3-level systems (atoms, in the original proposal)\nare located inside separate optical cavities, as illustrated\nin Fig. 1, with the left atom starting in an arbitrary superposition of its lower levels, |\u03c8i = cg |gi + ce |ei, and\nthe right atom in the state |gi. The objective of quantum state transfer is then to transfer the state |\u03c8i from\natom 1 to atom 2 by applying suitable laser pulses to\neach atom. This may be expressed as\n\n\u03c90 ) is the effective coupling strength between state |gi\nand |ei, and is proportional to Ej (t), the amplitude of\nthe laser electric field, which we will use to control the\ntransfer. We have also made the following definitions: \u00e2j\nis cavity j's photon creation operator, g is the cavityatom coupling strength, \u03bcer is the dipole matrix element between |ei and |ri, \u03b5 is the laser polarisation, and\n\u03c6j (t) is the phase of the laser. In deriving this equation,\nthere is an assumption that the laser frequency is detuned\nfrom the cavity mode , \u03c9c , nearest the transition, by an\namount \u03c9l \u2212 \u03c9c = g 2 /(\u03c9L \u2212 \u03c90 ), which is the ac-Stark\nshift of the state |gij in the electric field of the laser.\n\nFollowing the original proposal by Cirac et al. [2], the\ntransfer is made to be unidirectional and is constrained\nby the requirement that the photodetector, indicated in\nwhere the subscripts indicate the atom/cavity system.\nFig. 1, never registers a photon. The entire system is then\nThe term |0ij is cavity j's photon state in the number\nan open quantum system, and is described equivalently\nbasis, and is the vacuum state at the start and end of the\nby a quantum master equation, or a quantum trajectory\nprocess.\npunctuated by quantum jumps [12]. Since it will beIn the case that the detuning between the laser frecome important for the later development of this paper,\nquency and the atomic transition from |gi to |ei, \u03c9L \u2212\u03c90 ,\nwe summarise now some important points from Cirac et\nis larger than all other frequencies in the problem, one\nal., who adopt the quantum trajectories approach to the\ncan write a Hamiltonian for each atom-cavity system,\nproblem. The non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian that\nlabeled j = 1, 2, from which the upper level |ri is adiadescribes the evolution of the open system in between\nbatically eliminated,\njumps is \u0124eff = \u01241 + \u01242 \u2212 i\u03ba(\u00e2\u20201 \u00e21 + \u00e2\u20202 \u00e22 + 2\u00e2\u20202 \u00e21 ), where\n2\n\u03a9j (t)\n\u03ba is the cavity leakage rate and the jump operator is\n|eijj he| \u2212 igj (t)(ei\u03c6j (t) |eijj hg|\u00e2j \u2212 H.c).\n\u0124j (t)/~ =\n\u0109 = \u00e21 + \u00e22 .

(7) with respect to time, and then substituting\nEqs. (6a) and (6b), so is not linearly independent.\n\n\f3\nThere are thus only five independent equations,\nEqs. (5) through (7), but six unknowns, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b2s , \u03b2a , g1\nand g2 , and so there is no unique solution that satisfies the requirements of quantum state transfer. There\nis a notable symmetry in the evolution equations and\nthe initial and final states which is that if the cavity labels j = 1, 2 are exchanged and time is reversed, i.e.\n1 \u2194 2 and t \u2192 \u2212t, then they are recovered, so long\nas g2 (t) = g1 (\u2212t), which is referred to as the symmetric pulse condition. Under this condition, Cirac et al. [2]\npresent a method for generating pulse shapes that satisfy the requirements of quantum state transfer. This\nprocedure is as follows:\n1. Select g1 (t) for t \u2265 0.\n\nFIG. 2: Plot of the quantities given by Eqs. (10a) to (10c).\n\n2. Solve Eq. (6a) and a\u221a reduced form of Eq.

Define g1 (t) = \u2212( 2\u03ba\u03b2a (|t|)+g1 (|t|)\u03b11 (|t|))/\u03b12 (|t|)\nfor t < 0.\n\nof the form f (\u03b11 (t), \u03b12 (t)) = 0, and is consistent with\nEqs. (4) and (7). Thus we can use this as a second equation, along with Eq. (8) to solve for \u03b11 (t) and \u03b12 (t). By\nsubstituting for \u03b12 (t) in Eq.

The physical\nsolution is \u03b11 (t) = (1 \u2212 tanh(\u03bat))/2, and from this we\ncan determine all the other quantities to be\n\u03b12 (t) = \u03b11 (\u2212t) = (1 + tanh(\u03bat))/2,\n\u221a\n\u03b2a (t) = \u2212sech(\u03bat))/ 2,\n\n(10a)\n(10b)\n\ng1 (t) = g2 (t) = \u03ba sech(\u03bat).\n\n(10c)\n\nAlternate solution method\n\nUsing Eqs.

(4)\nand (7) and then solve this equation and Eq. (8) to find\n\u03b11 (t) and \u03b12 (t), from which we can calculate the other\nfunctions.\nWe can motivate an example of this method by making g1 (t) = g2 (t), so that pulses on each atom are the\nsame. We then divide Eq. (6a) by Eq. (6b), to find\n\u03b1\u03071 (t) = \u2212\u03b1\u03072 (t), and taking account of the initial condition, Eq. (4), we find that \u03b11 (t) + \u03b12 (t) = 1, which is\n\nNotably, this solution has the property that g1 (t) \u2192\n0 as t \u2192 \u221e, and it also satisfies the symmetric pulse\ncondition, g2 (t) = g1 (\u2212t), so is a member of the class\nof solutions generated by the method of Cirac et al. [2].\nWe now have two solutions out of an infinite range of\npossible ones (i.e. the solution presented in [2], and the\none above), which we will compare in later sections.\n\nIII.\n\nSTOCHASTIC NOISE IN LASER PULSE\n\nHaving presented an alternate pulse shape to accomplish quantum state transfer, we now use the two solutions, that in Cirac et al. [2] and in this paper, as test\ncases for evaluating the effect of stochastic noise in the\nlaser pulses on the fidelity of the transfer. We reformulate the problem in terms of a quantum master equation,\nas opposed to that of quantum trajectories [2, 5, 7], since\nwe will eventually take averages over an ensemble of noise\nrealisations, which must be done with respect to the density matrix rather than the state vector.\n\n\f4\n\uf8ee\u0002\n\n|g0g0i\n\n\u03c11,1\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0002\n\n\u03c11,2 \u03c11,3\n\n\u0003\n\n\u2192\n\n\u0002\n\n\u03c11,4 \u03c11,5\n\n\u0003 \uf8f9\n\n\uf8ef\u0014\n\u0015 \u057f \u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\uf8ef\n\u03c12,2 \u03c12,3\n\u03c12,4 \u03c12,5\n\uf8ef \u03c12,1\n\u2192\n\uf8ef\n\u03c13,2 \u03c13,3\n\u03c13,4 \u03c13,5\n\uf8ef \u03c13,1\n\uf8ef\n\u2193\n\u2193\n\uf8ef\u0014 \u2193 \u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\uf8f0 \u03c1\n\u03c14,2 \u03c14,3\n\u03c14,4 \u03c14,5\n4,1\n\u2192\n\u03c15,1\n\u03c15,2 \u03c15,3\n\u03c15,4 \u03c15,5\n\n|e0g0i\n|g1g0i\n|g0e0i\n|g0g1i\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\nFIG. 3: Structure of relationships between density matrix\nelements arising from Eq. (11a), with respect to the basis\nB, which is indicated on the left. Elements within each\nsub-matrix are mutually coupled. Arrows indicate the direction of coupling between the sub-matrices, so for instance\n\u03c1\u03075,5 depends on \u03c13,5 , but not vice-versa, i.e. derivatives are\nplaced at the arrow head, for example the equation for \u03c1\u03075,5 is\n\u03c1\u03075,5 = g2 (t) (\u03c14,5 + \u03c15,4 ) \u2212 2\u03ba (\u03c13,5 + \u03c15,3 + \u03c15,5 ). The arrows\ntherefore indicate the flow of information, from the states with\na single excitation in the left cavity to single excitation in the\nright cavity, but not in reverse, as determined by the one-way\nrequirement used to formulate the equations. The bold elements are those that may be non-zero at t = \u2212\u221e, and are\ngiven by |\u03c8ih\u03c8|.\n\nA.\n\nMaster Equation\n\nSince the process of information transfer is one-way, we\nadopt the cascaded quantum system approach, described\nin the text by Gardiner and Zoller [12], to derive a master\nequation. The quantum master equation for the cascaded\nsystem here is given by\ni\nih\n\u01241 (t) + \u01242 (t), \u03c1 + \u03baL{\u03c1},\n~\nL{\u03c1} =2\u00e21 \u03c1\u00e2\u20201 \u2212 \u00e21 \u00e2\u20201 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u00e21 \u00e2\u20201\n\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212\n\n+ 2\u00e22 \u03c1\u00e2\u20202 \u2212 \u00e22 \u00e2\u20202 \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1\u00e22 \u00e2\u20202\n\n\u2212\n\n2{[\u00e2\u20202 , \u00e21 \u03c1]\n\n+\n\n(11a)\n\n(11b)\n\n[\u03c1\u00e2\u20201 , \u00e22 ]},\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the system density matrix. Subsequently, we\nleave out explicit time dependence notation from the\nHamiltonians, H1 and H2 , unless required for clarity.\nIn lieu of writing out all 25 coupled, first-order differential equations arising from the master equation, we give\na schematic representation of the coupling between elements of the density matrix in Fig. 3, where arrows indicate the direction of the coupling. From this schematic\nrepresentation we can see how the equations ensure that\ninformation does flow unidirectionally from the left cavity to the right. The initial condition for this master\nequation is simply\n\u03c1(\u2212\u221e) = (|\u03c8i1 |gi2 |00i)(1 h\u03c8|2 hg|h00|).\n\n(12)\n\nFor future reference, if a matrix representation of an operator is given, it will be expressed with respect to the\nbasis B = {|g0g0i, |e0g0i, |g1g0i, |g0e0i, |g0g1i}, where\n\nthe state vector notation represents the state of the left\natom, left photon number, right atom and right photon\nnumber in order. The solutions we are interested in will\nbe those for which quantum state transfer has been successfully implemented, so\n\u03c1(+\u221e) = (|gi1 |\u03c8i2 |00i)(1 hg|2 h\u03c8|h00|).\n\n(13)\n\nWe will use the notation \u03c10 (t) to indicate any solution to\nthe noiseless master equation, Eq. (11a), which satisfies\nboth Eqs. (12) and (13). For an arbitrary time t, \u03c10 (t)\nwill depend on the pulse shape, nevertheless all permissible solutions will agree at t = \u00b1\u221e. Of course, for those\npulses that do satisfy the requirement of quantum state\ntransfer, the master equation will give the same result as\nsolving the quantum trajectory equations, Eq. (6).\n\nB.\n\nAdding Stochastic Noise\n\nWe add the effect of stochastic noise in the pulse shapes\nto the dynamics of the problem, and so we follow a similar\ndevelopment to that presented in recent work [13, 14].\nWe assume that for each realisation of a transfer attempt,\nthe actual classical laser pulse, g\u0303j (t), applied to atom j\nis perturbed from the desired shape according to g\u0303j (t) =\ngj (t) + \u03bej (t)\u2206gj (t), where \u03bej (t) is a stochastic function\nof time, and \u2206gj (t) is some function which will depend\non the origin of the stochastic error (i.e. noise), and\nis considered to be small. For instance, if the noise is\nassociated with fluctuations in the amplitude of the pulse,\nthen \u2206gj (t) = gj (t), so that g\u0303j (t) = (1 + \u03bej (t))gj (t), and\nif it is associated with errors in timing between the pulses\napplied to the two cavities then \u2206gj (t) = g \u0307j (t), both of\nwhich we consider later. This modifies the atom-cavity\nHamiltonian from that with an ideal pulse, which to first\norder in \u03bej (t) is\n\u0124j (t) \u2192 \u0124j (t) + \u03bej (t)\u0125j (\u2206gj (t)).\n\n(14)\n\nThe operator \u0125j is Hermitian and depends on \u2206gj (t).\nWith the modified Hamiltonian given in Eq. (14), the\nmaster equation reads\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212\n\ni\nih\n\u01241 + \u03be1 (t)\u01251 (t) + \u01242 + \u03be2 (t)\u01252 (t), \u03c1 + \u03baL{\u03c1},\n~\n(15)\n\nwhich we formally integrate on both sides to find \u03c1(t)\nand substitute back into the right-hand side (RHS) of\nthe equation, to generate the second order term in the\nDyson series. We then take averages over an ensemble of\nnoise realisations, and assuming the one-time correlation\nterms have zero mean, i.e. h\u03bej (t)i = 0, we arrive at the\nresult\n\n\f5\n\nh\u03c1\u0307(t)i = \u2212 i/~ [H1 + H2 , h\u03c1(t)i] + \u03baL{h\u03c1(t)i}\n\u0012\u0014 Z t\nh\ni\u0015 \u0014 Z\ndt\u2032 h \u03be1 (t)\u03be1 (t\u2032 )\u01251 (t\u2032 ), \u03c1(t\u2032 ) i + \u01252 ,\n+ (i/~)2 \u01251 ,\n\u0014\n\n+ \u01251 ,\n\nZ\n\n\u2212\u221e\nt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nh\ni\u0015 \u0014 Z\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndt h \u03be1 (t)\u03be2 (t )\u01252 (t ), \u03c1(t ) i + \u01252 ,\n\n\u2212\u221e\nt\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nWe write the averaged solution to the noisy master equation, Eq. (16), as a correction to \u03c10 (t), the density matrix\nin the absence of noise,\nh\u03c1(t)i = \u03c10 (t) + \u01eb1 \u2206\u03c11 (t) + \u01eb2 \u2206\u03c12 (t),\n\nt\n\nh\ni\u0015\ndt\u2032 h \u03be2 (t)\u03be2 (t\u2032 )\u01252 (t\u2032 ), \u03c1(t\u2032 ) i\n\n(16)\n\nh\ni \u0015\u0013\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\ndt h \u03be2 (t)\u03be1 (t )\u01251 (t ), \u03c1(t ) i .\n\nthe corresponding element \u03b7j (t) = hg0e0|\u2206\u03c1j (t)|g0e0i\n(which depends on \u2206gj (t)) we call the noise sensitivity.\nThis is motivated by Eq. (17), since errors in pulse j will\nperturb the final result away from unity\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u01ebj is a measure of the (small) variance of the noise\non laser pulse j, and will appear as a coefficient in the\ntwo-time correlation function h\u03bej (t)\u03bej (t\u2032 )i. In the case\nthat the stochastic terms on each pulse are uncorrelated\nwith one another, h\u03be1 (t)\u03be2 (t\u2032 )i = 0, which we will hereafter assume, we can substitute Eq. (17) into Eq. (16)\nand use Eq. (11a) to derive two independent master equations for the first order (in \u01ebj ) correction terms \u2206\u03c11 (t)\nand \u2206\u03c12 (t),\ni\nh\n \u0307 j = \u2212 i/~ \u01241 + \u01242 , \u2206\u03c1j + \u03baL{\u2206\u03c1j }\n\u2206\u03c1\n\u0015\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0014 Z t\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032 h\u03bej (t)\u03bej (t )i\n2\n\u0125j (t ), \u03c10 (t ) .\ndt\n+ (i/~) \u0125j ,\n\u01ebj\n\u2212\u221e\n(18)\nThe quantity \u01ebj \u2206\u03c1j (t) is therefore interpreted as a correction to the noiseless density matrix due to stochastic errors in pulse j. We note that the homogeneous part of the\nabove equation is the same as the original noiseless master equation, Eq. (11a), but it now has an inhomogeneous\ndriving term that depends on the solution to the noiseless\nequation, \u03c10 (t). We are interested in errors in the density matrix associated with stochastic errors in the pulse\nshape, so we assume that the initial state of the density\nmatrix can be prepared exactly, i.e \u2206\u03c1j (\u2212\u221e) = 0. The\nsolution to equation Eq. (11a) as t \u2192 \u221e is determined by\nEq. (13), but the solution to Eq. (18) is not constrained\nand may depend on both gj (t) and \u2206gj (t).\nIn numerical investigations of the error, we assume that\nthe initial state of the left atom is |\u03c8i = |ei, so that the\nonly non-zero matrix element is he0g0|\u03c10(\u2212\u221e)|e0g0i = 1.\nThis assumption is not restrictive, since as may be seen\nfrom the form of the coupling of the evolution equations\nin Fig. 3, the only initial condition that influences the\nmatrix elements \u03c1i,j (t), i, j \u2265 2 is that on the element\n\u03c12,2 (\u2212\u221e) = he0g0|\u03c10 (\u2212\u221e)|e0g0i = 1, and by the linearity of the equations we obtain the solution (up to a\nscaling factor) for any non-zero initial condition.\nAt the end of a noisless transfer, the only non-zero element will be hg0e0|\u03c10 (+\u221e)|g0e0i = 1, but at that time\nthe correction to the density matrix may be non-zero, and\n\nhg0e0|\u03c1(+\u221e)|g0e0i = 1 + \u01ebj \u03b7j (+\u221e).\n\n(19)\n\nWe can conclude from this that \u03b7j (+\u221e) \u2264 0, since \u01ebj \u2265 0\nand tr(\u03c1) = 1. The relation above makes evident the fact\nthat the stochastic (classical) noise is a source of decoherence for the transfer, since the probability of finding\nthe system in the state hg0e0|\u03c1(+\u221e)|g0e0i is less than\nunity.\nC.\n\nWhite Amplitude Error\n\nWe first apply the above result to the case where the\nstochastic errors arrive from unwanted fluctuations in the\namplitude of the pulse, as mentioned earlier. In principle this could arise from intrinsic laser amplitude noise,\nalthough this is typically negligibly small. More likely\nsources of error are in the details of the pulse shaping\nand might arise from phase and amplitude errors of the\nmodes selected to generate the pulse. In any case, we do\nnot consider these issues here, but instead assume that\nthe error has the property that \u2206gj (t) = gj (t), so that\ng\u0303j (t) = (1 + \u03bej (t))gj (t).\n\n(20)\n\nWe will also assume that the stochastic terms are \u03b4correlated,\nh\u03bej (t)\u03bej (t\u2032 )i = \u01ebj \u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\n\n(21)\n\nWith these assumptions the master equation for the corrections to the density matrix reduce to\ni\nh\nh h\nii\n \u0307 j = \u2212 i \u01241 + \u01242 , \u2206\u03c1j + L{\u2206\u03c1j } \u2212 1 \u0125j , \u0125j , \u03c10 ,\n\u2206\u03c1\n~\n2~2\n(22)\nwhere the factor of 1/2 in front of the double commutator\narises from integrating only half of the Dirac-\u03b4 function,\nand Eq. (22) is of Lindblad form.\nWe have solved the equations numerically (using\nthe numerical differential equation solver provided with\nMathematica 4.0) for two different pulse shapes, one\ngiven in this paper, Eqs. (10), and the other taken from\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 4: The evolution of the noise sensitivities, \u03b7j , for amplitude errors. The upper curves (solid) correspond to the\npulse shapes given in this paper, in Eqs. (10), whilst the lower\ncurves (dotted) are for the pulse shapes presented elsewhere\n[2]. The darker traces correspond to the solution for \u03b71 (t)\nlighter traces are for \u03b72 (t).\n\nFIG. 5: The evolution of the noise sensitivities, \u03b7, for timing\nerrors. The lower curve corresponds to the pulse shapes given\nin this paper, in Eqs. (10), whilst the upper curve is for the\npulse shapes presented elsewhere [2].\n\nIV.\n\nthe proposal for quantum state transfer by Cirac et al.\n[2]. The results for the noise sensitivities are plotted in\nFig. 4. For each pulse shape the noise sensitivities \u03b71 (t)\nand \u03b72 (t) appear to converge to the same value as t \u2192 \u221e,\nhowever they do differ by a small but definite amount between pulses shapes, being \u22121 (to the numerical precision\nof the equation solver) and approximately \u22121.17.\n\nD.\n\nWhite Timing Error\n\nUsing the same methods, we can consider the effect of\ntiming errors between the pulses applied to the cavities.\nIn this case it makes sense to define only one noise sensitivity, \u03b7, since we may assume that the pulse on the first\natom defines the origin of time, and thus it will be errors\nin the timing of the second pulse relative to the first that\nwill contribute to state transfer errors.\nFor timing errors, the noisy pulse shape is given by\ng\u03032 (t) = g2 (t + \u03be(t)),\n\u2248 g2 (t) + \u03be(t)g2\u2032 (t),\n\nOPTIMISING AGAINST NOISE\n\nFrom the two examples presented above, we can see\nthat different pulse shapes are more or less sensitive to\nerrors in their generation, depending on the nature of the\nerror. We will now examine how this variation may be\nused to optimise the pulse shape against sources of error.\nThe utility of this is in recognising that stochastic noise\nin control signals contributes to decoherence, which has\nbeen noted previously [14]. Whilst in that work, the\ndecoherence attributable to stochastic noise was found\nto be much less than that due to other effects (environment), the calculation was based on a nominally constant\ncontrol signal with stochastic noise superposed. The situation we consider here, though in a different system, is\nslightly more general in that the Hamiltonian is explicitly time dependent. Thus the errors in the control pulse\nwill not be simply the intrinsic (e.g. thermal) noise associated with the power source, but also dynamic errors\nassociate with signal generation, e.g. due to digitisation\nof a nominally continuous pulse, or errors in timing.\n\nA.\n\nOptimisation Strategy\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the second line follows by expanding to first order\nin the quantity \u03be(t). It may be seen from this form that\n\u2206g2 (t) = g2\u2032 (t), and for the pusposes of illustration, we\nwill again take the errors to be \u03b4-correlated, h\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032 )i =\n\u01eb\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ).\nThe result of the numerical solutions for the corrections\nto the density matrix are shown in Fig. 5. In this case\nthe pulse shape presented in this paper is very slightly\nmore susceptible to timing errors than the pulse shape\ngiven by Cirac et al. [2].\n\nIn principle, the problem of optimising the pulse shape\nagainst noise may be understood in terms of constrained\noptimisation. We wish to choose a pulse shape that minimises the noise sensitivity, \u03b7j (+\u221e), subject to the constraint that it satisfies the condition of pulse transfer,\ni.e. \u03b12 (+\u221e) = 1. Conceptually, this would provide\nus with another equation to supplement Eqs. (6) which\nthen makes the number of equations and unknowns equal,\nthereby specifying the pulse shape uniquely. In practise,\nwe could formulate this problem in terms of Lagrange\nmultipliers [15], and derive the following constrained op-\n\n\f7\ntimisation equations\nD\u03b7j (+\u221e)\nD\u03b12 (+\u221e)\n+\u03bb\n= 0,\nDg1 (\u03c4 )\nDg1 (\u03c4 )\n\u03b12 (+\u221e) = 1,\n\n(24)\n(25)\n\nwhere the operator D/Dg1 (\u03c4 ) represent the functional\nderivative with respect to the function g1 (\u03c4 ), and \u03bb is\nan unknown Lagrange multiplier. We have introduced\ntwo more equations, and one more unknown, to bring\nthe total number of each to seven. Since we have chosen\ng2 (\u03c4 ) = g1 (\u2212\u03c4 ) we do not consider functional derivatives\nwith respect to g2 (t). Although we don't prove it formally, we find that \u03b71 (+\u221e) = \u03b72 (+\u221e) in all numerical\ncalulations we have performed, so we only consider variational derivatives with respect to \u03b71 (+\u221e).\nIn fact, computing either of the above functional\nderivatives requires the solution of a set of differential equations that are of essentially the same form as\nEq. (11a), since they are formulated by taking variational\nderivatives of the master equation with respect to g1 (\u03c4 ),\nwhich must then be integrated. Since we do not have\nan analytic solution to the master equations for an arbitrary pulse shape, it is difficult to see how practically to\nmake use of these equations, except for very small scale\ndiscretisations.\nAnother approach is to use numerical substitution.\nHere, we discretise the pulse shape, defining gj = g1 (tj )\nfor several discrete times tj = t0 , . . . , tn\u22121 (setting gn =\n0), then interpolating between points. We allow all but g0\nto be variational parameters, and g0 is chosen depending\non g1 , . . . , gn\u22121 to satisfy the constraint, \u03b12 (+\u221e) = 1,\nwhich is the numerical equivalent of a substitution for\ng0 in terms of all other variational parameters. We then\nhave n\u2212 1 variational parameters, g1 , . . . , gn\u22121 , available\nfor unconstrained optimisation of \u03b71 (+\u221e), for which we\nmay use an unconstrained optimisation scheme. In the\ndetails of this method, the discretisation points are chosen to be in the domain t \u2265 0, and g0 is determined from\ng1 , . . . , gn\u22121 by use of the method outlined by Cirac et\nal. [2] (and at the end of section II A in this paper) which\ndetermines the efficacy of a given pulse shape in terms of\nits form for t \u2265 0.\nB.\n\nNumerical Results\n\nA number of numerical optimisations are performed\naccording to the numerical substitution scheme outlined\nabove. In one set of optimisations, three points are allowed vary, and one of them, at t = 0, is used to satisfy the condition for pulse transfer. The locations of\nthe other two points are equally spaced between t = 0\nand a fourth location, t = T , where the function is zero,\ni.e. the two intermediate points are located at t = T /3\nand t = 2T /3. These intermediate points are varied to\noptimise the pulse shape. The pulse shapes that result\nfrom the three-point optimisation process are presented\n\nas the lighter traces in Fig. 6(a) for five different values\nof \u03baT = 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.\nIn the other set of optimisations, six points are allowed\nto vary, again with the one at t = 0 being used to satisfy\nthe condition for successful pulse transfer. The remaining\nfive points are also equally spaced between t = 0 and\nt = T , for the same values of T as above, and the optimal\npulse shapes for the six-point optimisations are shown as\nthe darker traces in Fig. 6(a).\nFigure 6(b) demonstrates that the various pulses\nshown in Fig. 6(a) do each implement quantum state\ntransfer successfully, since |\u03b12 (t)|2 \u2192 1 as t \u2192 \u221e for\nall pulses. The figure also shows that as the width of\nthe pulse becomes broader, proportional to T , the transfer process takes longer, so the slope of |\u03b12 (t)|2 becomes\nshallower.\nFigure 6(c) shows the noise sensitivity, \u03b71 (t), for each\nof the pulses in Fig. 6(a). Naturally, the value of \u03b71 (+\u221e)\ngets closer to zero (i.e. better) as the number of optimisation points is increased, and it also gets better as the\nwidth of the pulse increases. It may be compared with\nFig. 4 which shows the noise sensitivity for the two analytic solutions discussed earlier and the optimisation process has clearly produced pulses that are significantly less\nsensitive to noise in the laser pulses than either of the analytic solutions discussed earlier in this paper. The best\npulse shape computed in the optimisations performed\nhere is that with T = 10, and has the limit \u03b71 \u2192 \u22120.58\nas t \u2192 \u221e. It appears that the optimisation procedure\nselects solutions with lower amplitudes, and this occurs\nbecause the form of noise we have assumed in this set\nof examples is proportional to the amplitude of the control pulse, thus lowering the amplitude tends to lower the\neffect of the noise.\nFigure 6(d) shows that the photon wave-packet transmitted between the cavities, which is proportional to\n\u03b2a (t), becomes broader. It may be seen from Eqs. (7)\nR +\u221e\nand (8) that \u2212\u221e |\u03b2a (t)|2 dt = 1, and the numerical solutions satisfy this to around one part in 105 .\nFigure 6(e) plots the limiting value of \u03b71 versus T , the\ntime after which g1 is zero, for the three-point (light) and\nsix-point (dark) optimisations. The solid curves are fitted\nb\nusing a function of the form a + c+T\n, where a, b and c are\nfitting parameters. In both cases, the surprisingly close\nfit has a = \u22120.5 to better than one part in 10\u22123 , suggesting that the ultimate limit to the optimisation process is\nan infinitely wide pulse with \u03b71 (+\u221e) = \u22120.5. This indicates that the effect of the noise cannot be removed by\nallowing the pulse duration to become infinitely long.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results presented in Fig. 6 above show that there is\na clear possibility of selecting pulse shapes that are more\nor less sensitive to fluctuations therein. Figures 4 and 5\nshow that pulses which perform better with respect to\none source of error may perform worse with respect to\n\n\f8\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n(d)\n\n(e)\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Optimised pulse shapes using three equally spaced points (light), and six equally spaced points (dark) for each\nof five different pulse widths.

In all figures, traces from steepest to shallowest correspond to narrowest to\nbroadest pulses in (a), with light traces corresponding to three-point optimisations, and dark traces to six-point optimisations.\n\nanother, so in a realistic implementation of the optimisations presented here, detailed knowledge of the sources\nof stochastic error in the pulses would be required.\nThe reduction in transfer error from an optimised pulse\nis moderate in the case of white amplitude noise considered here, reducing the error in the transfer by a factor of\na little over two compared to the original pulse shape presented by Cirac et al. [2]. Though this is not a very large\nimprovement, regardless of the shape chosen, pulse shaping will be needed to implement quantum state transfer,\nand so it is prudent to select the pulse with lowest noise\nsensitivity.\nThe order of magnitude of transfer errors produced\nby the pulse are set by the magnitude of \u01ebj , which is\n\nessentially the relative variance of the pulse fluctuations,\nintegrated over time. As mentioned earlier, for white\namplitude noise, one candidate that could produce this\nis intrinsic amplitude fluctuations in the laser. For a\ncw laser, this can almost immediately be ruled out as a\nlegitimate error source, since the relative RMS amplitude\nlasers in e.g. a diode laser are of order 10\u22126 [16], so the\nvariance is \u01ebj \u223c 10\u221212 , which is completely negligible.\nA more likely source of error may be due to either the\npulse generator or the pulse shaper. Whilst the original proposal for quantum state transfer was based on\natomic states, we have had in mind the application of\nthis scheme to electron spin states confined to quantum\ndots, with the dots contained within a linear microcav-\n\n\f9\ndefinite spin state of the electron).\nThis paper has been fundamentally concerned with\ntime dependent Hamiltonians, which are, conceptually,\ngenerally applicable to schemes for implementation of\nquantum computation. We therefore suppose that in\nmany quantum gates implemented with time dependent\ncontrol pulses, there could be some advantage in shaping\nthe control pulses to be minimally sensitive to errors, so\nthe ideas discussed in this paper may well be generalisable to other quantum information applications.\n\nity, in a similar scheme to that illustrated by Benson et\nal. [17] and suggested by Imamo\u1e21lu et al. [8, 9]. For a\ncavity of length 1 \u03bcm, the free spectral range is around\n1014 Hz, and if we imagine one of the Bragg mirrors has\ntransmissivity of 10\u22123 , then the cavity loss rate is around\n\u03ba \u2248 1011 sec\u22121 . This is an optimistic but not unreasonable estimate for the transmissivity, e.g. Lidzey et al. [18]\nreport a microcavity Q-factor of 125 (based on a cavity\nlinewidth of \u223c 20 meV and a mode frequency of 2.88 eV)\nfor a \u03bb/2 cavity, which corresponds to a mirror transmissivity of Tmir = 0.025 [19], and good quality cavity\nlinewidths may be as low as 0.5 meV [20], corresponding\nto Tmir = 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\nSince 1/\u03ba sets the time scale of the control pulse (see\ne.g. Fig. 6), the typical width of the pulse is \u223c 10 ps.\nWeiner [21] gives a relation for the shortest temporal feature that one may generate as \u03b4t = T /\u03b7 where T is the\nlargest temporal window, and \u03b7 is a measure of the potential complexity of the pulse. Typical values are quoted\nas T = 26.4 ps, which is the same order of magnitude\nas 1/\u03ba, and \u03b7 = 264, so \u03b4t \u2248 10\u221213 s. Thus, if we assert that fluctuations at time scales less than \u03b4t are uncontrolled, then an upper estimate on relative amplitude\nfluctuations might be \u03b4g \u2248 g \u2032 (t)\u03b4t, which means that uncontrolled relative amplitude fluctuations from the pulse\nshaper could be as large as 1/\u03b7 \u223c 0.01, which is certainly\nnot negligible.\nWe note in passing that the time scale of 10 ps is\nroughly coincident with the characteristic time required\nfor an electron in a travelling quantum dot generated by\na surface acoustic wave (SAW) (velocity \u2248 3000 m s\u22121 ),\nto traverese a distance of 1 \u03bcm, which is the typical dimension of a SAW wavelength [22], as well as a typical\nminimum spot size for an optical CW laser at its focal\npoint. Therefore, if a microcavity were constructed at\nthe end of the SAW based quantum computer proposed\nin [22], then a CW laser focused at the center of the microcavity with a cross-sectional intensity profile shaped\nsuch that an electron passing through the microcavity experiences a time varying electric field which implements\nquantum state transfer (e.g Eq. (10c)), then the quantum state transfer scheme discussed in this paper could\nbe used for both an interconnect between several SAW\nquantum processors and for electron-spin measurement\n(detection of a photon out of the cavity corresponds to a\n\nWe have analyzed the effect of stochastic noise on a\ncontrol pulse that implements quantum state transfer\nbetween two atoms or quantum dots. We have found\nan alternate analytic solution for laser pulses that implement quantum state transfer, and using the two analytic\nsolutions we have available, we found that although different control pulses are capable of implementing quantum state transfer, they may have different sensitivities\nto noise, depending both on their shape and the source\nof the noise. We then provided a method for calculating\npulse shapes with lower noise sensitivities thereby optimising the pulse shape. This method was demonstrated\nto produce more optimal control pulses for the case of\nnoise that is proportional to the control pulse amplitude\nwith a white spectrum. A number of successively better pulse shapes were presented, and extrapolating the\nimprovement in the noise sensitivity to its limit (i.e. for\ninfinitely wide pulses) strongly suggests that the influence of this particular form of noise cannot be cancelled\ncompletely.\n\n[1] R.
