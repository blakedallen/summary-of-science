In the case of the non-relativistic fluid, this\nis achieved by the Clebsch parametrization of the velocity potential v = \u2207\u03b8 + \u03b1\u2207\u03b2,\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 (the Gauss potentials) and \u03b8 are scalar fields [9]. In the hamiltonian\nformulation, the Clebsch parametrization allows to express the kinematic helicity\nas a surface integral and to realize canonically the non-vanishing brackets between\nthe variables \u03c1 (matter density field) and v [10]. In [6], it was proposed a different\nparametrization of the fluid potentials in which the vortex dynamics is expressed in\nterms of grassmannian coordinates and the vortex is associated to the spin. That\nparametrization has been used for the generalization of the Chaplygin gas model in\nd = 2 + 1 and d = 3 + 1 [11](see for an introduction and reviews [12, 13].)\nAnother very interesting proposal for a parametrization of the fluid potentials\nwas put forward in [14], where the potentials are complex coordinates on an arbitrary\nK\u00e4hler manifold. That approach allows to construct interesting models of supersymmetric fluids which, on their turn, shade some light on the problem of the superfluid\nphases of certain supersymmetric systems [15, 16, 17]. The parametrization of the\npotentials in terms of complex coordinates preserves the property of the Clebsch\nparametrization, namely to elliminate the obstruction to building a consistent lagrangian which could exist due to a Chern-Simons term that is necessary in order to\nconsider the non-zero vorticity [12]. The complex parametrization can be introduced\ninstead of the Clebsch parametrization already at the non-supersymmetric level and\nthe full structure of the divergence free currents and the topological charges associated to non-zero vorticity can be obtained in this way [14]. An important feature of\nthe complex parametrization is that the hamiltonian dynamics is governed by a set\nof simple second-class constraints among the fluid degrees of freedom. In this paper,\nwe propose a quantized theory for a large set of non-supersymmetric relativistic fluid\nmodels on K\u00e4hler manifolds.\nThe fluid properties of the system under consideration are described by a set of\nfields that represent the fluid potentials and which, together with their canonically\nconjugate momenta, can be organized to form a canonical phase space. The potentials and their momenta are subjected to second class constraints which form a set\nof simple algebraic equations. As a first result, we will obtain the physical degrees of\nfreedom of the largest set of classical fluid models by applying the symplectic projector method developped in [18, 19, 20] and more recently employed in the study\nof the extended abelian Chern-Simons theory [21], the noncommutative open string\n[22], the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory [23], the Lorentz-symmetry violation [24],\nquantum gravity potentials [25] and cosmological perturbations [26] (see for reviews\n[27, 28].) Althought equivalent to other methods used to solve the second class constraints, the symplectic projector method has the advantage of giving a geometrical\npicture to the relationship between the set of fields and their canonical conjugate\n\n\fmomenta on one hand and the set of physical degrees of freedom defined by local coordinates on the constraint surface on the other hand. Compared with the literature,\nour results reproduce exactly the general classical hamiltonian from [14]. Moreover,\nthere are some new results consisting in the explicit identification of the physical\ndegrees of freedom and of their relationship with the linearly dependent fields. The\nmain result of this paper is the quantization of a smaller class of models parametrized\nby the K\u00e4hler potential K(z, z) and a real parameter \u03bb. That corresponds to choosing\nthe arbitrary potential function on the fluid density f (\u03c1) of the form f (\u03c1) = \u03bb\u03c12 /2\nby which a set of quantizable fluid models is selected. The larger class of classical\nmodels is parametrized by K(z, z) and the general potential functions f (\u03c1) and, in\ngeneral, it is not suitable for quantization due to the arbitrary form each of these\ntwo functions can take. Our approach to the quantum fluid is based on the canonical\nquantization performed in the physical phase space of the relativistic fluid. However,\nsince the K\u00e4hler and the complex potentials determine a d = 3 vector field A(z, z)\nassociated to the conserved currents, we quantize the field A rather than the complex fields z and z. Due to the large arbitrariness in choosing the K\u00e4hler potential\nK(z, z), there is no simple relationship between the quantized fields A and z and\nz. That suggest that one could also consider a semiclassical situation in which the\npotential A is kept classical and just the canonical pair \u03b8 and \u03c0\u03b8 is quantized. However, it turns out that in this case the Fock space is highly degenerate having all\none-particle states proportional to the vacuum. Therefore, the quantization of the\ncomplex potentials is imposed, and quantizing the field A represents the simplest\napproach to this problem. The last new result of this paper is the calculation of the\nquantum topological charge (or quantum linking number) operator \u03c9\nb . This is constructed from the normal ordered expression of the classical topological charge. The\nnormal ordering is necessary because there are terms in \u03c9\nb which have the general\n3\nn\nform \u03b4 (0) k , where k is any component of the momentum and n = 1, 2, 3. These\nterms are undetermined in the low momentum limit and vanish otherwise. We discuss\nthe structure of the Fock space with respect to \u03c9\nb and show that the vacuum and the\nnumber operator eigenstates have zero linking number while the linear combination\nof tensored number operators eigenstates have non-zero topological charge 1 .\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly review the general\nrelativistic fluid on Kh\u00e4ler manifolds in the hamiltonian formulation from [14]. Also,\nwe determine the physical degrees of freedom which are the local coordinates on\nthe constraint manifold by the symplectic projector method and write down the\nexpression of the physical hamiltonian and the conserved charges in term of these.\nThe physical hamiltonian obtained by applying the symplectic method coincides with\nthe one given in the literature. In Section 3 we quantize the particular class of models\nparametrized by K(z, z) and \u03bb. We give the structure of the Fock space and show\nthat if the vector potential A is considered as a classical field, the Fock space of\nthe semiclassical quantized fluid is highly degenerate. In Section 4 we discuss the\nquantum topological operator and determine the general form of the states from the\nFock space which have non-vanishing linking number. The last section is devoted to\nconclussions.\n1\n\nThe quantum fluid states with non-zero linking number are actually entangled number operators\neigenstates.\n\n\f2 Relativistic Fluid in the Hamiltonian Formulation\nIn this section we are going to review the non-supersymmetric perfect relativistic\nfluid studied in [14]. Also, we are going to derive the physical degrees of freedom\nin a new way by applying the symplectic projector method developped in [27, 28].\nThat is equivalent, of course, to solving the constraint equations in a purely algebraic\nway as was done in [14]. However, the symplectic projector method provides a simple\ngeometrical picture for the relationship among potentials, physical degrees of freedom\nand constraint surface.\nIn the class of models under consideration, the relativistic fluid is characterized\nby the equations of state for the local physical quantities p, \u03b5, and \u03c1 which are the\npressure, the energy density and the local fluid density, respectively. The dynamics\nconserves the energy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd and the fluid density current j \u03bc\n\u2202 \u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n\u2202\u03bc j \u03bc = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nT\u03bc\u03bd = p\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + (\u03b5 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd ,\n\nj \u03bc = \u03c1u\u03bc .\n\n(2)\n\nHere, \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd = (\u2212, +, +, +) is the Minkowski metric, u\u03bc = dx\u03bc /d\u03c4 is the velocity fourvector with u2\u03bc = \u22121 and \u03c4 is the proper time along the flow line of the current.\nFrom the current conservation given in the equations (1), one can see that there are\nthree independent current components to which one can assign three fluid potentials\n(\u03b8, z, z\u0304) that play the role of the Lagrange multipliers in the lagrangian formulation\nof the theory. As was argued in [14], one can take \u03b8 real, z complex and z\u0304 the complex\nconjugate of z. One can choose the complex potentials to parametrize an arbitrary\nK\u00e4hler manifold characterized by the K\u00e4hler potential K(z, z\u0304) which is a real function\non z and z\u0304. The above conservation equations can be obtained from the following\nlagrangian density [14]\n\u0001\n(3)\nL[j \u03bc , \u03b8, z\u0304, z] = \u2212j \u03bc \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 + i\u2202K\u2202\u03bc z \u2212 i\u2202K\u2202\u03bc z \u2212 f (\u03c1),\n\nwhere \u2202K = \u2202z K, \u2202K = \u2202z K and f (\u03c1) is some potential function\np on \u03c1. Also, one\ncan see from the definition of the fluid density current that \u03c1 = \u2212j 2 . The action is\ninvariant under the spacetime translations and the potential fields reparametrizations. The corresponding conservation laws are: the conservation of the energymomentum tensor and the conservation of the fluid density current as given in\nthe equations (1), and the conservation of an infinity of reparametrization currents\nJ\u03bc [G] = \u22122G(z\u0304, z)j\u03bc , where G(z\u0304, z) are arbitrary analytic functions on z and z. Beside the reparametrization currents given above, there are conserved axial currents\ngenerated by conserved topolgical charges defined by the following relation [14]\nZ\ni\nh\n(4)\n\u03c9 = \u22122i d3 x \u2202i \u03b5ijk \u03b8\u2202\u2202K\u2202j z\u0304 \u2202k z .\nThe charges \u03c9 can be interpreted as the linking number of vertices formed in the\nfluid.\n\n\fThe fluid flow and the non-zero vorticity can be described in the hamiltonian\nformalism, too. Following [14], we define the canonically conjugate momenta as follows\n\u03c0\u03bc =\n\u03c0z =\n\n\u2202L\n\u2202u\u03bc\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u0001\n= \u03c1 \u2202\u03bc \u03b8 + i\u2202K\u2202\u03bc z \u2212 i\u2202K\u2202\u03bc z\u0304 ,\n\n\u2202L\n= i\u2202Kj0 ,\n\u2202\u22020 z\n\n\u03c0z =\n\n\u03c0\u03b8 =\n\n\u2202L\n= j0 ,\n\u2202\u22020 \u03b8\n\n\u2202L\n= \u2212i\u2202Kj0 .\n\u2202\u22020 z\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nNote that the currents j\u03bc do not appear dynamically in the theory and that the axial\ncurrent depends locally on \u03c0\u03bc . Therefore, the relevant phase space for the physical\ndegrees of freedom is the reduced phase space (\u03b8, z, z\u0304, \u03c0\u03b8 , \u03c0z , \u03c0z ). The equations (6)\nrepresent a set of two second class constraints in the reduced phase space\n\u03a91 = \u03c0z \u2212 i\u2202K\u03c0\u03b8 = 0,\n\n\u03a92 = \u03c0z\u0304 + i\u2202K\u03c0\u03b8 = 0.\n\n(7)\n\nThe physical degrees of freedom of the relativistic fluid can be obtained from\nthe reduced phase space potentials by applying the symplectic projector method by\nwhich the reduced phase space is projected on to the constraint surface defined by\nthe relations (7) [20, 27, 28]. Let us introduce the following notation for the potentials\nand their momenta\n{\u03bei } = {\u03be1, \u03be2, \u03be3, \u03be4, \u03be5, \u03be6 } = {\u03b8, z, z\u0304, \u03c0\u03b8 , \u03c0z , \u03c0z } .\n\n(8)\n\nThe local coordinates on the constraint surface {\u03bei\u2217 } are obtained by applying the\nsymplectic projector \u039b to the reduced phase space fields {\u03bei }\n\u03bei\u2217 (x0 , x)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n3\n\nd y\n\n6\nX\n\n\u039bji (x0 , x, y)\u03bej (x0 , y),\n\n(9)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the general form of the symplectic projector is given by the following relation\nZ\n\u03b4\u03a9\u03b2 (x0 , w)\n\u03b4\u03a9\u03b1 (x0 , z) \u22121 0\ni\n0\ni 3\nik\nD\n(x\n,\nz,\nw)\n.

However,\nsince now the system is on the constraint surface, one can use the constraints {\u03a9\u03b1 }\nto express the coordinates \u03be5\u2217 and \u03be6\u2217 as functions of \u03be4\u2217 . This lefts us with the correct\n\n\fnumber of physical degrees of freedom, that is six real degrees of freedom \u03be \u2217 's which\nhave been obtained from the ten real fields \u03be's acted upon by two complex constraint\nequations \u03a9\u03b1 .

Also note that the currents\nJ \u03bc [G] generate now the reparametrization symmetry of the physical subspace.\n\n3\n\nQuantization of the Relativistic Fluid\n\nThe theory presented in the previous section describes a large class of relativistic\u0012 fluid models\n\u0013 parametrized by the K\u00e4hler potential K(z, z) and the function\nq\n2\n\u2217\nf\n(\u03be4 ) \u2212 j2 , respectively. Both of these functions can have a quite general form\n\nwhich makes addressing the issue of quantization difficult, if not impossible, in the\ngeneral case. A less general but still interesting class of relativistic fluid models can\nbe obtained by choosing a simple form for f (\u03c1) while leaving the K\u00e4hler manifold\narbitrary. The equations of state of the reduced set of models have the following form\n[14]\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n(13)\np = \u03b5 = \u03c12 , f (\u03c1) = \u03c12 .\n2\n2\nThese models are parametrized by the K\u00e4hler potential K(z, z) and the real number\n\u03bb. From the equations of motion for jl , l = 1, 2, 3, one can determine the explicit\nform of these currents in terms of the reduced phase space fields as follows\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2202H\u2217\n1\ni\ni\n(14)\n= 0 =\u21d2 jl =\n\u2202l \u03be1\u2217 + \u2202K\u2202l \u03be2\u2217 \u2212 \u2202K\u2202l \u03be3\u2217 .\n\u2202jl\n\u03bb\n2\n2\nBy applying the symplectic projector formalism employed in the previous section and\nby using the equations (14), the following physical hamiltonian is obtained\n\u0012\n\u00132\ni\ni\n\u03bb\n1\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(15)\n\u2207\u03be1 + \u2202K\u2207\u03be2 \u2212 \u2202K\u2207\u03be3 + (\u03be4\u2217 )2 .\nH =\n2\u03bb\n2\n2\n2\nNote that H\u2217 is identical to the hamiltonian calculated in [14] for the models\nparametrized by {K(z, z), \u03bb}.\nThe quantization of the relativistic fluid described by the hamiltonian (15) can\nbe performed in the canonical approach. Let us return to the original field notations\n{\u03b8, \u03c0\u03b8 , z, z} where the fields are from the physical phase subspace. The canonical\nconjugate variables are \u03b8 and \u03c0\u03b8 , while z and z do not propagate. Let us introduce\nthe following real vector potential field\ni\ni\nA(K, z, z) \u2261 A(x) = \u2202K\u2207z \u2212 \u2202K\u2207z.\n2\n2\n\n(16)\n\nFrom the Hamilton equations, we obtain the following equation of motion for the \u03b8\npotential\n\u0001\n\u2202 0 \u22020 + \u22072 \u03b8(x0 , x) = \u2212\u2207 * A(x0 , x).\n(17)\n\n\fThis equation shows that the physical phase subspace of the relativistic fluid is equivalent to that of a massless scalar field \u03b8 moving inside the potential created by K(z, z)\nand the fluid potentials z and z. Actually, by assuming that \u03b8(x0 , x)A(x0 , x) \u2192 0\nas x0 \u2192 \u221e, one can write the hamiltonian (15) as\n\u0014\n\u0015\nZ\n\u03bb 2\n1\n2\n\u2217\n0\nH = dx dx\n\u03c0 +\n(\u2207\u03b8) + V (\u03b8, A) ,\n(18)\n2 \u03b8 2\u03bb\nwhere\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n2\nV (\u03b8, A) = \u2212 \u03b8\u2207 * A \u2212 (A) .\n\u03bb\n2\n\n(19)\n\nFor \u2207 * A 6= 0, the function V has a zero for each field configuration that satisfies\n\u03b80 =\n\n1 (A)2\n.\n2\u2207*A\n\n(20)\n\nAt the points from the physical phase subspace where the equations (20) is satisfied,\nthe relativistic fluid is described by the scalar potential \u03b8 only, and it is equivalent\nto a free massless scalar field. Actually, the vanishing of the gradient of the vector\npotential signals an extremum of V . The extrema of V in the \u03b8 direction and in the\nA directions, respectively, are given in terms of physical degrees of freedom by the\nfollowing equations\n\u0001\n\u0001\ni \u2202K\u2202j z \u2212 \u2202K\u2202j z = 2\u2202j \u03b8.\n(21)\n\u2202j \u2202K\u2202j z \u2212 \u2202K\u2202j z = 0,\nThe potential V takes at these points the following values\nV1 =\n\n\u0001\n1\n1\n(A)2 , V2 = \u2212\n\u03b8\u2202j \u2202 j \u03b8 \u2212 \u2202j \u03b8\u2202 j \u03b8 .\n2\u03bb\n2\u03bb\n\n(22)\n\nIf the extremum value is obtained in all directions of physical phase subspace simultaneously, then by equating V1 and V2 we obtain the following relationship among\nthe fluid potentials\n(\u2202K)2 \u2207z * \u2207z + \u2202K\n\n\u00012\n\n\u2207z * \u2207z \u2212 2\u2202K\u2202K\u2207z * \u2207z + 2\u03b8 (\u2207)2 \u03b8 \u2212 2\u2207\u03b8 * \u2207\u03b8 = 0. (23)\n\nThe above equation describes the fluid configurations for which the contribution to\nthe fluid energy from the K\u00e4hler and the complex fluid potentials and from their\ninteraction with the scalar fluid potential is extreme.\nFor the classical models described above, the reparametrization charges Q[G] have\na simple form in terms of physical phase space coordinates\nZ\n\u2217\nQ[G(\u03be )] = d3 xG(z, z)\u03c0\u03b8 .\n(24)\nTherefore, it is easy to show that the charges Q[G] are conserved provided that the\nfollowing relation holds\nZ\nds * (\u2207\u03b8 + A) = 0,\n(25)\n\u03a3\n\nwhere ds is the area element of \u03a3 which is a spacelike surface at the spatial infinity.\nSince the theory is formulated in the hamiltonian formalism, it is possible to\nstudy the quantum fluctuation of the relativistic fluid in the canonical quantization.\n\n\fTo this end, we interpret \u03b8 and A as field operators with the dynamics given by\nthe equation (17) and replace the Poisson brackets on the constraint surface by the\ncorresponding commutators. In what follows we are going to use the symbol b to\ndenote the operators.

Also, since A\nconstructed from non-propagating fields 2 , we consider the simplest situation where\nA is a massless field, too. Then it is possible to set the normalization constants Nk\u03b8 =\nNkA = Nk . By plugging the relations (27) and (28) into n\n(26), we obtain\nthe following\no\nb k (x0 ) = bbnk (x0 ) , n = 1, 2, 3,\nset of equations for the operators b\nak (x0 ) and b\n\u0001\nb k (x0 ),\n\u220202 + k2 b\nak (x0 ) = ik * b\n\n(29)\n\nfor all k.

For example, the one-particle excitations of the quantum fluid potentials are\ndescribed by the following states\n\nIn this way, the canonical quantization can be carried out straightforwardly to\nthe relativistic fluid models described by the hamiltonian (15). However, there are\nsome differences from the general field quantization due to the quantum equation of\nmotion (26) that should be satisfied operatorially on all quantum states, and to some\nc Indeed, the\narbitrariety in defining the quantum structure of the vector potential A.\nequation (26) takes the following form in terms of creation and annihilation operators\n\u0013\u0010\n\u0012\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c9k2\n2\nbk + b\nb \u2020 |\u03c8i .\n(43)\nb\nak + b\na\u2020\u2212k |\u03c8i = ik * b\n\u2212 2 +k\nk\nc\n\u0010\n\u0011\nNote that for k = 0 either \u03c90 = 0 or b\na0 + b\na\u20200 |\u03c8i = 0.

Therefore, in principle one could also consider\nthe possibility of the semiclassical quantized fluid in which the field A is a classical\nvector potential and the dynamical canonical pair (\u03b8, \u03c0\u03b8 ) is quantized. However, by\nrepeating the steps performed above in the canonical quantization formalism, but now\nb is the identity operator, we arrive at the following relation\nwith \u00c2 = A1\u0302, where 1\namong the one-particle excitations and the vacuum state\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c92\n2\n(46)\n|ki\u03b8 = i k \u2212 2 k * bk |0i\u03b8 .\nc\nThat shows that if the Fourier coefficients bnk are classical functions on z and z, then\nthe Fock space is highly degenerate with all one-particle states proportional to the\nvacuum. Thus, we conclude that if the relativistic fluid model of the type discussed\nhere is to be treated as a quantum system, the vector potential A should be quantized\nas before in order to avoid the infinite vacuum degeneracy.\n\n4\n\nQuantum Topological Charge\n\nIn this section we are going to construct the quantum topological charge (quantum\nlinking number) operator which is the quantum counterpart of the classical linking\nnumber, and to discuss the properties of the Fock space states with respect to it.\nThe starting point is the classical topological linking number \u03c9 defined in the\nrelation (4). After some algebraic manipulations, it can be put in the following form\nZ\n\u03c9 = d3 x\u03b5lmn (\u2202l \u03b8\u2202m \u2202n \u03b8 + 2\u2202l \u03b8\u2202m An + 2Al \u2202m \u2202n \u03b8 + 4Al \u2202m An ) .\n(47)\nNote that the first and the third terms from the above relation vanish due to presence\nof the totally antisymmetric tensor in the integrand, while the second term vanishes\nup to a total derivative. Let us define the quantum topological charge operator \u03c9\nb by\ninterpreting the fields in (47) as quantum operators and taking the normal ordering\nof the creation and annihilation operators in the mode expansion of the quantum\nfields inside the integral. The ordering prescription is necessary due to the presence\nof potentially divergent terms, e.g. \u03b43 (0) kl km \u03b5lmn , which for arbitrary value of kn\nare zero and for |k| \u2212\u2192 0 have an undetermined limit. They are a consequence of\nthe commutation relation (37) among the oscillator operators of \u03b8b field. By using the\nfield expansion relations (33), (34) and (35) inside the relation (47), the quantum\ntopological charge operator can be decomposed in the following sum\n\u0001\n:\u03c9\nb (x0 ) : = 2 (2\u03c0)3 : \u03c9\nb2 (x0 ) : + 2i : \u03c9\nb4 (x0 ) : ,\n(48)\nThe operators : \u03c9\nba (x0 ) : , a = 2, 4 from the r. h. s. of the above relation represent\nthe operatorial counterpart of the the second term, kept due to its total derivative\ncontribution, and the last term from the relation (47), respectively, in that order.\nAfter some calculations, one arrives at the following explicit form of the operators\n\n\f:\u03c9\nba (x0 ) : written in terms of creation and annihilation operators\nZ\nh\ni\n2i\u03c9k 0\n0\nc\u2020 e 2i\u03c9c k x0 k k ,\nak + b\na\u2020kbbnk + b\nakbbnk e\u2212 c x + ab\u2020 k b\n:\u03c9\nb2 (x ) : = d3 kNk2 \u03b5lmn bb\u2020nkb\nl m\nnk\n:\u03c9\nb4 (x0 ) : =\n\nZ\n\nh\n\n2i\u03c9\n\u2212 ck\n\nblk \u2212 bblkbbnk e\nd3 kNk2 \u03b5lmn bb\u2020 lkbbnk \u2212 bb\u2020 nkb\n\nx0\n\n+ bb\u2020lkbb\u2020nk e\n\n2i\u03c9k 0\nx\nc\n\ni\n\n(49)\n\nkm .\n(50)\n\nSince the components of the momentum kn commute with any operator, one can see\nthat : \u03c9\nb2 : vanishes due to the presence of the totally antisymmetric tensor. The\nsame symmetry arguments do not apply to : \u03c9\nb4 : which is not zero. However, the\ntime dependent terms vanish in : \u03c9\nb4 : . Indeed, by using the commutation relations\n(37) in the terms \u03b5lmnb\nblkb\nbnk km and \u03b5lmnbb\u2020lkbb\u2020nk km , one obtains vanishing operator\ncoefficients for each component kn . Therefore, the topological charge operator of the\nquantum relativistic fluid from the class of models discussed here has the form\nZ 3\n\u0011\nd k lmn \u0010 b\u2020 b\n\u03b5 km b lk bnk \u2212 bb\u2020 nkbblk ,\n(51)\n:\u03c9\nb : = 2i\u03bb~c\n\u03c9k\nwhere the dependence on x0 has been dropped from : \u03c9\nb : . Remark that the quantum\ntopological number operator is parametrized by the parameter \u03bb linearly and that\nit is expressed in ~c units. Its dependence on the K\u00e4hler and complex potentials is\nhidden in the integrand and has a simple form due to the quantization of A field.\nThe fields \u03b8b and \u03c0\nb\u03b8 do not contribute to the topological charge operator that is time\nindependent.\nIn order to see how : \u03c9\nb : \u0010acts on the\n\u0011 Fock space, we consider a general state of\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\nfixed momentum vector k = k1 , k2 , k3 of the form\n3\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011E\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011E O\n\u0010 \u2032\u0011\n\u0010 \u2032\u0011\n\u0010 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u0011E\nnq kq .\n=\n= n1 k1 , n2 k2 , n3 k3\n\u03a8 k1 , k2 , k3\n\n(52)\n\nq=1\n\n\u0010 \u2032\u0011\nHere, nq kq denotes the number nq of excitations of bq type which have the value\n\u2032\n\nof momentum kq in the q = 1, 2, 3 direction. The last equality in (52) shows that the\nstate factorizes as a tensor product of number operator eigenstates in the corresponding directions 3 . Also, we consider that the number of excitations in each direction is\nfixed in the state (52) and that the number operator eigenstates are ortogonal and\nnormalized to unity\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011E\nD\n\u2032\n(53)\n= \u03b4l,s \u03b4nl ,ms \u03b4 kl \u2212 ks .\nnl (kl ) |ms ks\n\nIt is easy to see that the expectation value of : \u03c9\nb : is zero in the states of the form\n(52) because of the fixed number of excitations in each direction one starts with. The\nvacuum state is of the form (52) and thus one concludes that the vacuum has zero\nlinking number as expected.\nThe dependence of the state given in the relation (52) on the excitations of the scalar potential \u03b8b does\nnot affect the calculation of the topological charge since \u03b8b does not contribute to the topological number\noperator.\n3\n\n\fSince the fixed number of excitations in the state (52) together with the ortogonality relation (53) make the topological charge number vanish, one could take instead\nthe more general linear combination of states that have the following form\n|\u03a8i =\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\u2032\n(2\u03c0)3\n\n3\nX\n\nn1 ,n2 ,n3 =1\n\n\u0010 \u2032 \u0011E\n\u0010 \u2032\u0011\n\u0010 \u2032\u0011\n\u0010 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\u0011\nCn1 ,n2 ,n3 k1 , k2 , k3 n1 k1 , n2 k2 , n3 k3 ,\n\n(54)\n\n\u0010 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032\u0011\nwhere the arbitrary complex coefficient functions Cn1 ,n2 ,n3 k1 , k2 , k3 can be normalized to make the integral covariant if necessary. The states from the above relations\nare entangled states of tensored number operators eigenstates. One can show that\nthe expectation value h : \u03c9\nb : i in the states of the form (54) is given by the following\nrelation\nh: \u03c9\nb : i = 4i\u03bb~c\n\nZ\n\nd3 k\n\u03c9k\n\n3\nX\n\nCn1 ,n2 ,n3 (k1 , k2 , k3 )\n\nn1 ,n2 ,n3 =1\n\nn hp\ni\np\n\u00d7 k1\nn2 (n3 + 1)C n1 ,n2\u22121 ,n3+1 (k1 , k2 , k3 ) \u2212 n3 (n2 + 1)C n1 ,n2+1 ,n3\u22121 (k1 , k2 , k3 )\nhp\ni\np\n+ k2\nn1 (n3 + 1)C n1 +1,n2 ,n3\u22121 (k1 , k2 , k3 ) \u2212 n1 (n3 + 1)C n1\u22121 ,n2 ,n3+1 (k1 , k2 , k3 )\nhp\nio\np\n+ k3\nn1 (n2 + 1)C n1 \u22121,n2+1 ,n3 (k1 , k2 , k3 ) \u2212 n2 (n1 + 1)C n1+1 ,n2\u22121 ,n3 (k1 , k2 , k3 ) ,\n(55)\n\nSome comments are in order now. Firstly, note that the quantum topological\nnumber given in the relation (55) is different from zero if the integral does not\nvanish. This\nshould be satisfied by a large set of arbitrary coefficients\n\u0010 \u2032 condition\n\u0011\n\u2032\n\u2032\nCn1 ,n2 ,n3 k1 , k2 , k3 which thus define the states with non-vanishing quantum topological linking number. Secondly, one can see from the classical state equations of the\nmodel (13) and the relation (55), that there is a large number of quantum states in\nwhich the quantum linking number is infinite due to the infinite value of the classical limit of the pressure density or the energy density, i. e. for p \u2192 \u221e or \u03b5 \u2192 \u221e,\nrespectively. On the other hand, for p \u2192 0 or \u03b5 \u2192 0, the topological number is zero,\nunless the integral and sum in the r. h. s. of (55) diverge in the corresponding state.\nThirdly, note that in general either the quantum linking number is zero or it is time\nindependent as expected. This result expresses the conservation of the expectation\nvalues of the linking number operator.\n\n5\n\nConclussions\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the quantization of the relativistic fluid on K\u00e4hler\nmanifolds. The class of models considered here are parametrized by an arbitrary\nK\u00e4hler potential depending on two complex fluid potentials z and z and a real parameter \u03bb. That type of models represents a subset of a larger set parametrized by\n{K(z, z), f (\u03c1)} that was firstly\nq proposed in [14]. Due to the arbitrary dependence\n\nof the lagrangian on \u03c1 = \u03c0\u03b82 \u2212 j2 , the full set of relativistic fluid models is not\nsuitable for quantization. As was shown in [14], the degrees of freedom of the full set\n{K(z, z), f (\u03c1)} are constrained by second class constraints. As a first result, we have\n\n\fobtained the physical degrees of freedom of the fluid described by {K(z, z), f (\u03c1)} by\napplying the symplectic projector method. We have concluded that the classical theory on the physical surface displays the same topological charges as the original theory\n[14] since the symplectic projector does not include the conserved axial currents. Our\nresults for the full set of classical relativistic fluids agree with the ones presented in\nthe literature which revalidates the applicability of the symplectic projector method\nto second class constraints.\nThe main result of this paper is the quantization of the smaller set of models\n{K(z, z), \u03bb}. We have obtained the quantum theory by applying the canonical quantization methods to the pair of fields (\u03b8, \u03c0\u03b8 ) as well as to the vector field A(K, z, z)\nwhich encodes the information about the K\u00e4hler and the complex fluid potentials,\nrespectively, and we have constructed the Fock space of the relativistic fluid and\nthe one-particle excitations of the relativistic potentials. Also, we have discussed the\nsemiclassical quantization of the relativistic fluid in which the potential A(K, z, z) is\na classical field. By analysing the one-particle spectrum, it has been shown that the\nvacuum of the semiclassical theory is infinitely degenerate. From that, one concludes\nb should be treated as a quantum field.\nthat A\nThe second important result of the present paper is the construction of the quantum linking number operator \u03c9\nb which was defined by taking the normal ordered field\nproducts in the r. h. s. of the relation (47). The operator \u03c9\nb is time independent and\nit is determined only by the K\u00e4hler and the complex potentials, with no contribution\nfrom the real potential. We have shown that the vacuum of the quantum relativistic\nfluid has vanishing linking number, as well as the states formed by taking the tensor\nb field. However, there are entangled\nproduct of number operators eigenstates of A\nnumber operator eigenstates with non-vanishing linking number.\nAs a final comment, we note that the classical topological number can be expressed\nas a surface term as in the relation (4). It would be certainly interesting to compare\nthe approach presented in this paper with a different quantization method and to\nattempt a proper treatment of the boundaries in the quantum theory. That analysis\nand the application of the present method to the supersymmetric fluid [6] in the\nK\u00e4hler parametrization will hopefully be discussed elsewhere.\nAcknowledgements We thank to H.
