LERARIO\n\nAbstract. We prove the bound b(X) \u2264 n(n + 1) for the total Betti number of\nthe intersection X of three quadrics in RPn . This bound improves the classical\nBarvinok's one which is at least of order three in n.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn this paper we address the problem of bounding the total Betti number of\nthe intersection X of three real quadrics in RPn . In the case X were a smooth,\ncomplete intersection, then its total Betti number can be easily bounded using\nSmith's theory: its equations can be real perturbed as not to change its topology\n(it is smooth) and to make its complex points also a smooth complete intersection;\nin the case of a complete intersection XC of three quadrics in CPn it is possible to\ncompute its Betti numbers using Hirzebruch's formula and this would give a bound\nof the type b(X) \u2264 b(XC ) \u2264 p(n) where p is a polynomial of degree two.\nIn the general case, i.e. when we make no regularity assumption on X, the problem\nturns out to be more complicated. If we simply naively perturb the equations\ndefining X we can of course make its complex point to be smooth, but then the\ntopology of the real part would have change.\nThe very first attempt to bound the topology of the intersection of k quadrics in\nRPn is to use the well known Oleinik-Petrovskii-Thom-Milnor inequality (see [6]),\nwhich gives the estimate1:\nb(X) \u2264 O(k)n .\nSurprisingly enough it turns out that the fact that X is defined by quadratic equations allows to interchange the role of the two numbers n and k and to get the\nclassical Barvinok's bound (see [4]):\nb(X) \u2264 nO(k) .\nThe hidden constant in the exponent for this estimate is at least two, as noticed\nalso by the authors of [5], where a more refined estimate is presented (but of the\nsame leading order).\nIn particular in the case X is the intersection of three quadrics in RPn this classical\nestimates would give\nb(X) \u2264 nO(3) .\nThe passage from Oleinik-Petrovskii-Thom-Milnor bound to Barvinok's one is essentially made using a kind of duality argument, which works for the quadratic\nSISSA, Trieste.\n1According to [6] in this context the notation f (n) = O(n) means that there exists a natural\nnumber b such that the inequality f (n) \u2264 bn hods for every n \u2208 N.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. LERARIO\n\ncase, between the number of variables and the number of equations. This idea\nappeared for the first time in the paper [2] and we explain it now. If we have the\nquadratic forms q0 , . . . , qk on Rn+1 , then we can consider their linear span L in the\nspace of all quadratic forms. The arrangement of L with respect to the subset Z of\ndegenerate quadratic forms (those with at least one dimensional kernel) determines\nin a very precise way the topology of the base locus:\n\\\n{[x] \u2208 RPn | q(x) \u2264 0}.\nX=\nq\u2208L\\{0}\n\nThe simplest invariant we can associate to a quadratic form q is its positive inertia\nindex i+ (q), namely the maximal dimension of a subspace V \u2282 Rn+1 such that q|V\nis positive definite. In a similar fashion we are led to consider for j \u2208 N the sets:\n\u03a9j = {q \u2208 L\\{0} | i+(q) \u2265 j}.\nThe spirit of the mentioned duality is in this procedure of replacing the original\nframework with the filtration:\n\u03a9n+1 \u2286 \u03a9n \u2286 * * * \u2286 \u03a91 \u2286 \u03a90 .\nThis duality is widely investigated in the paper [3], where a spectral sequence\nconverging to the homology of X is studied; this spectral sequence has second term\nE2i,j isomorphic to H n\u2212i (L, \u03a9j+1 ). Thus, at a first approximation, the previous\ncohomology groups can be taken as the homology of X and as long as we consider\nfiner properties of the arrangement of L, then new information on the topology of\nits base locus is obtained. It is remarkable that only using this approximation the\nclassical Barvinok's bounds can be recovered; in this setting they can be formulated\nin the form:\nX\n(1)\nb(X) \u2264 n + 1 +\nb(\u03a9j+1 )\nj\u22650\n\nThe introduction of the full methods from [3] made also possible in some cases to\nstrongly improve the classical bounds. For example in the paper [11] the author\nproves that the total Betti number of the intersection X of two quadrics in RPn\nis bounded by 3n + 2; in the same papers are provided also bounds linear in k for\neach specific Betti number of X.\nThe intersection of L with the set of degenerate forms Z is customary called the\nspectral variety C of the base locus X. In this paper we present the idea that\nin the case X is the intersection of three quadrics, then its topological complexity\nis essentially that of its spectral variety C; this variety is in fact the \"difference\"\nbetween the various sets \u03a9j and thus the sum in the right hand side of (1) in a\ncertain sense is \"bounded\" by b(C). This idea originally appears in [1] in the regular\ncase. Here enters the deep connection, generally called Dixon's correspondence,\nbetween the intersection of three real quadrics in RPn and curves of degree n + 1\non RP2 : in the case X is a smooth, complete intersection the corresponding curve\nis the projectivization of the spectral variety (see [9] and [8]). In our framework\nX is no longer smooth, nor a complete intersection, and a pertubative approach is\nintroduced to study it; this approach associates to X a smooth curve in S 2 which\nreplaces the role of the spectral variety (indeed in the regular case this curve is\nthe double cover of the curve given by Dixon's correspondence). We relate the\ncomplexity of X to that of this new curve and using a Harnack's type argument on\nthe sphere will give us the mentioned bound b(X) \u2264 n(n + 1).\n\n\fTHE TOTAL BETTI NUMBER OF THE INTERSECTION OF THREE REAL QUADRICS\n\n3\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author is grateful to his teacher A. A. Agrachev: the main idea of this paper\nis a natural development of his intuition.\n2. General settings\nWe recall in this section a general construction to study the topology of intersection of real quadrics. We set Q(n + 1) for the space of real quadratic forms in n + 1\nvariables; if q0 , . . . , qk belong to this space, then we can consider their common zero\nlocus X in RPn :\nX = VRPn (q0 , . . . , qk ),\n\nq0 , . . . , qk \u2208 Q(n + 1)\n\nTo study the topology of X we introduce the following auxiliary construction. We\ndenote by q the (k + 1)-ple (q0 , . . . , qk ) and consider the map q : S k \u2192 Q(n + 1),\ndefined by\n\u03c9 7\u2192 \u03c9q = \u03c90 q0 + * * * + \u03c9k qk ,\n\n\u03c9 = (\u03c90 , . . . , \u03c9k ) \u2208 S k .\n\nThis map places the unit sphere S k linearly into the space of quadratic forms, in\nthe direction of the chosen quadrics. For a given quadratic form p \u2208 Q(n + 1)\nwe denote by i+ (p) its positive inertia index, namely the maximal dimension of\na subspace of Rn+1 such that the restriction of p to it is positive definite. For a\nfamily of quadratic forms depending on some parameters, like the map q describes,\nwe consider the geometry of this function on the parameter space. We are thus\nnaturally led to define the sets:\n\u03a9j = {\u03c9 \u2208 S k | i+ (\u03c9q) \u2265 j},\n\nj\u2208N\n\nThe following theorem relates the topological complexity of X to that of the sets\n\u03a9j . For a semialgebraic set S we define b(S) to be the sum of its Betti numbers2.\nTheorem 1 (Topological complexity formula).\nX\nb(X) \u2264 n + 1 +\nb(\u03a9j+1 )\nj\u22650\n\nProof. Consider the topological space B = {(\u03c9, [x]) \u2208 S k \u00d7 RPn | (\u03c9q)(x) > 0}\ntogether with its two projections p1 : B \u2192 S k and p2 : B \u2192 RPn . The image\nof p2 is easily seen to be RPn \\X and the fibers of this map are contractible sets,\nhence p2 gives a homotopy equivalence B \u223c RPn \\X. Consider now the projection\np1 ; for a point \u03c9 \u2208 S 2 the fiber p\u22121\n1 (\u03c9) has the homotopy type of a projective\nspace of dimension i+ (\u03c9q) \u2212 1, thus the Leray spectral sequence for p1 converges\nto H \u2217 (RPn \\X) and has the second terms E2i,j isomorphic to H i (\u03a9j+1 ). A detailed\nproof of the previous\nP statements can be found in [3]. Since rk(E\u221e ) \u2264 rk(E2 )\nthen b(RPn \\X) \u2264 j\u22650 b(\u03a9j+1 ). Recalling that by Alexander-Pontryagin duality\nHn\u2212\u2217 (X) \u2243 H \u2217 (RPn , RPn \\X), then the exactness of the long cohomology exact\nsequence of the pair (RPn , RPn \\X) gives the desired inequality.\n\u0003\n2From now on every homology group is assumed with Z coefficients, unless differently stated;\n2\nthe same remark applies to Betti numbers.\n\n\f4\n\nA. LERARIO\n\nRemark 1. A more refined formula for b(X) follows by considering a different spectral sequence directly converging to Hn\u2212\u2217 (X). In fact by [3] there exists such a\nspectral sequence (Er , dr )r\u22650 with second term E2i,j \u2243 H i (B, \u03a9j+1 ), where B is the\nunit ball in Rk+1 and \u03a9j+1 \u2286 \u2202B. If we let \u03bc be the maximumPof i+ on S k and \u03bd be\nits minumum, then we get b(X) \u2264 rk(E2 ) \u2264 n+1\u22122(\u03bc\u2212\u03bd)+ \u03bd+1\u2264j+1\u2264\u03bc b(\u03a9j+1 ).\nThe paper [3] contains a description of the second differential of this spectral sequence, which happens to be related with the set of points on S k where \u03c9q has\nmultiple eigenvalues, together with applications.\nRemark 2. By universal coefficients theorem, the previous bound is valid also for\nthe total Betti number of X with coefficients in Z (but on the right hand side Z2\ncoefficients are still assumed).\nThe previous formula, together with some results from [6], can be used to give\nthe classical Barvinok's estimate (see the paper [4]).\nCorollary 2 (Barvinok's estimate).\nb(X) \u2264 (n + 1)O(2k+2) .\nProof. Let us fix a scalar product; then the rule hx, (\u03c9Q)xi = q(x) defines a symmetric matrix \u03c9Q whose number of positive eigenvalues equals i+ (\u03c9q). Consider\nthe polynomial det(\u03c9Q \u2212 tI) = a0 (\u03c9) + * * * + an (\u03c9)tn \u00b1 tn+1 ; then by Descartes'\nrule of signs the positive inertia index of \u03c9Q is given by the sign variation in the\nsequence (a0 (\u03c9), . . . , an (\u03c9)). Thus the sets \u03a9j+1 are defined on the sphere S k by\nsign conditions (quantifier-free formulas) whose atoms are polynomials in k + 1\nvariables and of degree less than n + 1. For such sets we have the estimate, proved\nin [6]: b(\u03a9j+1 ) \u2264 (n + 1)O(2k+1) . Putting all them together we get:\nb(X) \u2264 n + 1 +\n\nn\nX\n\nb(\u03a9j+1 ) \u2264 (n + 1)O(2(k+1))\n\nj=0\n\n(notice that k + 1 is the number of quadrics cutting X).\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3. The paper [4] contains the bound for the set S of solutions of k quadratic\ninequalities in Rn+1 , which is b(S) \u2264 (n+1)O(k) . The set X in RPn can be viewed as\ndouble covered by a subset X \u2032 in Rn+1 defined by k +2 quadratic inequalities (those\ndefining X together with the quadratic equation for the unit sphere); by the transfer\nexact sequence b(X) \u2264 12 b(X \u2032 ) and by Barvinok's estimate b(X \u2032 ) \u2264 (n + 1)O(k+2) ;\nsince the constant hidden in the previous exponent is at least two, then we get the\nsame order as in the previous corollary.\nA more refined bound in the general case can be found in [5].\n3. Preliminaries on perturbations\nLet now p \u2208 Q(n + 1) be a positive definite form (we will use the notation p > 0\nfor such forms) and for every \u01eb > 0 and k \u2208 N let us define the sets:\n\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb) = {\u03c9 \u2208 S k | i\u2212 (\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) \u2264 n \u2212 j}\nwhere i\u2212 denotes the negative inertia index, i.e. i\u2212 (\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) = i+ (\u01ebp \u2212 \u03c9q). The\nfollowing lemma relates the topology of \u03a9j+1 and of its perturbation \u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb).\n\n\fTHE TOTAL BETTI NUMBER OF THE INTERSECTION OF THREE REAL QUADRICS\n\n5\n\nLemma 3. For every positive definite form p \u2208 Q(n + 1) and for every \u01eb > 0\nsufficiently small\nb(\u03a9j+1 ) = b(\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)).\nS\nj+1\nProof.

Hence every \u03b7 \u2208 U also belongs\nto \u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb). From this consideration it easily follows that each compact set in \u03a9j+1\nis contained in some \u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb) and thus\n\nlim{H\u2217 (\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb))} = H\u2217 (\u03a9j+1 ).\n\u2212\u2192\n\u01eb\nIt remains to prove that the topology of \u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb) is definitely stable in \u01eb going to zero.\nConsider the semialgebraic compact set Sn\u2212j = {(\u03c9, \u01eb) \u2208 S k \u00d7 [0, \u221e) | i\u2212 (\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) \u2264\nn\u2212j}. By Hardt's triviality theorem (see [7]) we have that the projection (\u03c9, \u01eb) 7\u2192 \u03c9\nis a locally trivial fibration over (0, \u01eb) for \u01eb small enough; from this the conclusion\nfollows.\n\u0003\nLet us now move to specific properties of pencils of three quadrics.\nWe recall that the space of degenerate forms\n` Z = {p \u2208 Q(n+1) | ker(p) 6= 0} admits\na semialgebraic Nash stratification Z = Zi such that its singularities belong to\nstrata of codimension at least three in Q(n + 1); this is a classical result and the\nreader can see [2] for a direct proof.\nLemma 4. There exists a positive definite form p \u2208 Q(n + 1) such that for every\n\u01eb > 0 small enough the curve\nC(\u01eb) = {\u03c9 \u2208 S 2 | ker(\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) 6= 0}\nis a smooth curve in S 2 such that the difference of the index function \u03c9 7\u2192 i\u2212 (\u03c9q \u2212\n\u01ebp) on adjacent components of S 2 \\C(\u01eb) is \u00b11.\nProof. Let Q+ be set of positive definite quadratic forms in Q(n + 1) and consider\nthe map F : S 2 \u00d7 Q+ defined by\n(\u03c9, p) 7\u2192 \u03c9q \u2212 p.\n+\n\n\u22121\nSince\n` Q\u22121 is open in Q, then F+ is a submersion and F (Z) is Nash-stratified\nby\nF (Zi ).

LERARIO\n\nsemialgebraic, then by semialgebraic Sard's Lemma (see [7]), the set \u03a3i = {q\u0302 \u2208\nQ+ | q\u0302 is a critical value of \u03c0i } is a semialgebraic subset of Q+ of dimension strictly\nless than dim(Q+ ). Hence \u03a3 = \u222ai \u03a3i also is a semialgebraic subset of Q+ of dimension dim(\u03a3) < dim(Q+ ) and for every p \u2208 Q+ \\\u03a3 the map \u03c9 7\u2192 f (\u03c9) \u2212 p\nis transversal to each Zi .

Since the codimension\nof the singularities of Z are at least three, then for p \u2208 Q+ \\\u03a3 and \u01eb > 0 small\nenough the curve {\u03c9 \u2208 S 2 | ker(\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) 6= 0} is smooth. Moreover if z is a smooth\npoint of Z, then its normal bundle at z coincides with the sets of quadratic forms\n{\u03bb(x \u2297 x) | x \u2208 ker(z)}\u03bb\u2208R then also the second part of the statement follows. \u0003\nEssentially lemma 4 tells that we can perturb the map \u03c9 7\u2192 \u03c9q in such a way\nthat the set of points where the index function can change is a smooth curve on S 2 ;\nlemma 3 tells us how to control the topology of the sets \u03a9j+1 after this perturbation.\nRemark 4. In higher dimension all that we can do is perturb\n` the map q as to make\nit as best as possible, i.e. transversal to all strata of Z = Zi ; for example in the\ncase of four quadrics we can make the hypersurface {\u03c9 \u2208 S 3 | ker(\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) 6= 0} a\nreal algebraic manifold of dimension two with at most isolated singularities.\n4. Harnack's type inequalities\nIn this section we bound the topology of a smooth curve C \u2282 S 2 (as the above\none) in a way similar to Harnack's classical bounds for smooth curves in RP2 . We\nstart with the following lemma.\nLemma 5. Let G \u2208 R[\u03c90 , . . . , \u03c93 ] be a homogeneous polynomial. The set \u03a3 of all\nhomogeneous polynomials F of a fixed degree d such that VCP3 (F, G) is not a smooth\ncomplete intersection in CP3 is a proper real algebraic set in R[\u03c90 , . . . , \u03c93 ](d) .\nProof. The set \u03a3C of homegeneous polynomials H with complex coefficients and\na\ndegree d such that VCP3 (H, G) is not a complete intersection in CP3 is clearly\n\u0001\nproper complex algebraic subset of C[\u03c90 , . . . , \u03c93 ](d) \u2243 CN , where N = 4+d\n.\nLet\nd\n\u03a3C be defined by the vanishing of certain polynomials f1 , . . . , fl in C[z1 , . . . , zN ].\nSince \u03a3 equals \u03a3C \u2229 RN , then it is real algebraic; it remains to show it is proper.\nSuppose not. Then \u03a3C \u2229 RN = RN , which means that each of the fi vanishes\nidentically over the reals. In particular, fixing all but one variables in fi we have\na complex polynomial in one variable which has infinite zeroes, hence it must be\nzero. Iterating the reasoning for each variable this would give that each fi is zero,\nwhich is absurd since \u03a3C was a proper algebraic set.\n\u0003\nLemma 6. Let f \u2208 R[\u03c90 , \u03c91 , \u03c92 ] be a polynomial of degree d such that\nC = {(\u03c90 , \u03c91 , \u03c92 ) \u2208 S 2 | f (\u03c90 , \u03c91 , \u03c92 ) = 0}\nis a smooth curve; then the number of its ovals is at most d(d \u2212 2) + 2.\nProof. If f is homogeneous, then C is the double cover of a smooth curve C \u2032 in\nRP2 of degree d; hence by Harnack's inequality b(C \u2032 ) \u2264 (d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 2. By\nthe transfer exact sequence b(C) \u2264 2b(C \u2032 ), which in this case gives the bound\n(d \u2212 1)(d \u2212 2) + 2 \u2264 d(d \u2212 2) + 2 for the number of the ovals of C.\nAssume now f is not homogeneous and let F \u2208 R[\u03c90 , . . . , \u03c93 ] be its homogenization\n\n\fTHE TOTAL BETTI NUMBER OF THE INTERSECTION OF THREE REAL QUADRICS\n\n7\n\n(the new variable is \u03c93 ); let also G be the polynomial G(\u03c90 , . . . , \u03c93 ) = \u03c902 + \u03c912 +\n\u03c922 \u2212 \u03c932 . Using this setting we have that the curve C coincides with:\nVRP3 (F, G) \u2282 RP3\n(there are no solutions on the hyperplane {\u03c93 = 0} to F = G = 0). By lemma 5\nthere exists a real perturbation F\u01eb of the polynomial F , homogeneous and of the\nsame degree of F , such that\nVCP3 (F\u01eb , G) \u2282 CP3\nis a smooth complete intersection in CP3 . Moreover since the perturbation was\nreal, then by Smith's theory the total Betti number of VRP3 (F\u01eb , G) is bounded by\nthat of VCP3 (F\u01eb , G); on the other hand since VRP3 (F, G) was smooth, then a small\nperturbation of its equations does not change its topology, hence the total Betti\nnumber of C = VRP3 (F, G) also is bounded by that of VCP3 (F\u01eb , G). It remains to\nprove that for the complete intersection VCP3 (F\u01eb , G) the bound on its topological\ncomplexity is 2d(d \u2212 2) + 4. To this end notice that Y = VCP3 (F\u01eb , G) is a smooth\ncomplex curve of degree 2d; hence if we let KY be its canonical bundle the adjunction formula reads KY = OCP3 (d \u2212 2)|Y = (OCP3 (1)|Y )\u2297(d\u22122) . Since the degree of\nKY is 2g(Y ) \u2212 2, then\n2g(Y ) \u2212 2 = (d \u2212 2)deg(OCP3 (1)|Y ) = (d \u2212 2)2d.\nSince b(Y ) = 2g(Y ) + 2 this concludes the proof.\n\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 7. There exists a positive definite form p in Q(n+1) such that for every\n\u01eb > 0 small enough the smooth curve\nC(\u01eb) = {\u03c9 \u2208 S 2 | ker(\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) 6= 0}\nhas at most (n + 1)(n \u2212 1) + 2 ovals.\nProof. Let p be given by lemma 4. Fix a scalar product in such a way that each\nquadratic form can be identified with a real symmetric matrix, as in the proof\nof Barvinok's estimate. Thus \u03c9Q and P are the symmetric matrices associated\nrespectively to \u03c9q and p. The conclusion follows simply by applying the previous\nlemma to the polynomial f (\u03c90 , \u03c91 , \u03c92 ) = det(\u03c9Q \u2212 \u01ebP ), which has degree n + 1. \u0003\nWe recall in this section also the following elementary fact.\nLemma 8. Let \u03a9 \u2282 S 2 be a surface with boundary \u2202\u03a9 6= \u2205. Then:\nb(\u03a9) = b0 (\u2202\u03a9)\nProof. By additivity of the formula it is sufficient to prove it in the case \u03a9 is\nconnected. In this case \u03a9 is homotopy equivalent to the sphere S 2 minus b0 (\u2202\u03a9)\npoints and thus b0 (\u03a9) = 1 and b1 (\u03a9) = b0 (\u03a9) \u2212 1.\n\u0003\n5. The total Betti number of the intersection of three real\nquadrics\nThe aim of this section is to prove the following theorem, which estimates the\ntotal Betti number of the intersection X of three real quadrics in RPn . Notice that\nwe do not require any nondegeneracy assumption.\nTheorem 9. Let X be the intersection of three quadrics in RPn . Then:\nb(X) \u2264 n(n + 1)\n\n\f8\n\nA. LERARIO\n\nP\nProof. We use the refined formula b(X) \u2264 n + 1 \u2212 2(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd) + \u03bd+1\u2264j+1\u2264\u03bc b(\u03a9j+1 )\nfor the total Betti number of X; if we use only the topological complexity formula the estimate we can produce is a bit worst, but always of the type n2 +\nterms of lower degree). By lemma 4 there exists a positive definite form p such\nthat for every \u01eb > 0 sufficiently small the curve C(\u01eb) = {\u03c9 \u2208 S 2 | ker(\u03c9q \u2212 \u01ebp) 6= 0}\nis smooth; moreover by lemma 3 for such a p and for \u01eb > 0 small enough we also\nhave the equality b(\u03a9j+1 ) = b(\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)). This in particular gives\nX\nb(X) \u2264 n + 1 \u2212 2(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd) +\nb(\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)).\n\u03bd+1\u2264j+1\u2264\u03bc\n\nSince for each \u03bd + 1 \u2264 j + 1 \u2264 \u03bc the set \u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb) is a submanifold of S 2 with\nnonempty boundary, then by lemma 8:\nb(\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)) = b0 (\u2202\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)).\nP\nIn particular\nb(\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)) equals\nb0 (\u2202\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb)), where in both cases the sum is\nmade over the indexes \u03bd + 1 \u2264 j + 1 \u2264 \u03bc. The second part of lemma 4 implies\nnow that each of the ovals of C(\u01eb) belongs to the boundary of exactly\nP one of the\n\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb), \u03bd + 1 \u2264 j + 1 \u2264 \u03bc. This implies that the previous sum\nb(\u2202\u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb))\nequals exactly the number c of ovals of C(\u01eb). In particular this gives:\nP\n\nb(X) \u2264 n + 1 \u2212 2(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd) + c.\nIf \u03bc = \u03bd, then b(X) \u2264 n + 1; thus we may assume 2(\u03bc \u2212 \u03bd) \u2265 2. Corollary 7 tells\nthat c \u2264 (n + 1)(n \u2212 1) + 2, which finally gives:\nb(X) \u2264 n + 1 \u2212 2 + (n + 1)(n \u2212 1) + 2 = n(n + 1).\n\u0003\nRemark 5. Since in the previous proof the sets \u03a9n\u2212j (\u01eb) and their boundaries were\nsemialgebraic subsets of S 2 , then their Betti numbers with coefficients in Z coincide\nwith those with coefficient in Z2 ; moreover by the universal coefficient theorem\nb(X; Z) \u2264 b(X) and thus we also have:\nb(X; Z) \u2264 n(n + 1).\nRemark 6. If we define the map q : Rn+1 \u2192 R3 whose components are (q0 , q1 , q2 ),\nthen the intersection of the three quadrics defined by the vanishing of q0 , q1 and q2\nequals {[x] \u2208 RPn | q(x) = 0}. In a similar way if K \u2282 R3 is a closed polyhedral\ncone, we may define (by slightly abusing of notations) the set q \u22121 (K) = {[x] \u2208\nRPn | q(x) \u2208 K}. Such a set is the set of the solutions of a system of three quadratic\ninequalities in RPn and using the spectral sequence of [3] and a similar argument as\nabove it is possible to prove a bound quadratic in n for its topological complexity.\nWe leave the details to the reader.\nRemark 7. In the case X is a complete intersection of quadrics in RPn , estimates\non the number of its connected components are given in [8]. In particular, following\nthe notations of [8], we can denote by Brk (n) the maximum value that the k-th Betti\nnumber of an intersection (not necessarily complete) of r + 1 quadrics in RPn can\nhave. There it is proved that for complete intersections\nB20 (n) \u2264\n\n3\nl(l \u2212 1) + 2,\n2\n\nl = [n/2] + 1.\n\n\fTHE TOTAL BETTI NUMBER OF THE INTERSECTION OF THREE REAL QUADRICS\n\n9\n\nThe reader should notice that, in accordance with our result, the estimate is quadratic in n; our bound tells in particular that this quadratic estimate holds for\nevery Betti number and also without regularity assumptions.\nReferences\n[1] A.
