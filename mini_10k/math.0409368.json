The pebbling number \u03c0 = \u03c0(G) is the minimum\nnumber so that every configuration of \u03c0 pebbles has the property that, for\nany given target vertex, after some sequence of pebbling steps, the target\nhas a pebble on it. Two basic results are that the complete graph satisfies\n\u03c0(Kn ) = n, and that the path satisfies \u03c0(Pn ) = 2n\u22121 , where n = n(G) is\nthe number of vertices of the graph G. The pebbling numbers of trees and\ncycles have also been computed in [5] and [6], respectively. It is easy to see\nthat n(G) and 2diam(G) are each lower bounds on \u03c0(G), and Kn and Pn\nshow that these bounds can be tight (here diam(G) is the diameter of G).\nChung [2] proved that the d-dimensional hypercube, or d-cube, satisfies\n\u03c0(Qd ), which interestingly is tight on both accounts. There is a radiply\ngrowing literature on the subject (see [3]), including a handful of variations\non the theme such as optimal pebbling and pebbling thresholds.\nIn this paper we consider the cover pebbling number, first introduced in\n[4]. The cover pebbling number \u03b3 = \u03b3(G) is the minimum number so that\nevery configuration of \u03b3 pebbles has the property that, after some sequence\nof pebbling steps, every vertex has a pebble on it. Crull, et al. [4], find the\ncover pebbling number of trees and complete graphs. Because n targets\n\n3\n\n\fmust be reached instead of just one, the bound \u03b3(G) \u2264 n\u03c0(G) holds in\ngeneral. In light of Chung's result this yields \u03b3(Qd ) \u2264 4d . Here we prove\nthe following.\nTheorem 1 The cover pebbling number of the d-cube is \u03b3(Qd ) = 3d .\nIn [4] is also defined the cover pebbling ratio \u03c1 = \u03b3/\u03c0. Using Moews's\nresult on trees, the authors show that \u03c1 can be as small as 2 (cliques, paths)\nand as large as n/ lg n (brooms or fuses). In the case of cubes we have the\nfollowing.\nCorollary 2 The cover pebbling ratio of the d-cube is \u03c1(Qd ) = nlg 3\u22121 =\nn.5849625... .\n\n2\n\nPreliminaries\n\nWe begin by developing the terminology we will employ. A configuration C of pebbles on the vertices V (G) of a graph G is a function C :\nV (G)\u2192{0, 1, 2, . . .}, where C(x) is the number of pebbles on vertex x. The\nsize of C equals |C| =\n\nP\n\nx\u2208V\n\nC(x), the total number of pebbles on G. The\n\nsupport of C is the set \u03c3 = \u03c3(C) = {x \u2208 V | C(x) > 0} of vertices having\nat least one pebble. We say that C is simple if |\u03c3(C)| = 1, is a cover if\n\u03c3(C) = V (G), and is even if C(x) is even for every x. A vertex x is empty\nif C(x) = 0, a one if C(x) = 1, a two if C(x) = 2, and is large if C(x) \u2265 2.\nThe configuration C is called coverable if after some sequence of pebbling\n4\n\n\fsteps no vertex is empty. If C has a large vertex having an empty neighbor,\nwe say that C is open; otherwise it is closed. Finally, for the purposes of\nthis article, C is good if |C| \u2265 3n \u2212 |\u03c3(C)| + 1, and is sharp if equality holds.\nWe note that a simple configuration of size 3n \u2212 1 is not coverable.\nIndeed, to reach a vertex at distance i from a simple support requires 2i\npebbles, as shown by \u03c0(Pi+1 ). Thus \u03b3(Qd ) \u2265\n\nPd\n\ni=0\n\nd\ni\n\n\u0001 i\n2 = 3d .\n\nOur proof of Theorem 1 borrows an idea from Chung's proof that\n\u03c0(Qd ) = 2d (see [2]). Using induction, she proved the extra statement\nthat Qd had the 2-pebbling property. A graph G has this property if, from\nevery configuration C that satisfies |C| \u2265 2\u03c0(G)\u2212|\u03c3(C)|+1, one can place 2\npebbles on any specified target. It is a curious property that suggests that\nmore concentrated configurations require greater size to maintain power.\nFor example, if C is a cover on Qd then it needs only to be of size n + 1 to\n2-pebble an arbitrarily chosen target, while if it is simple then it needs to\nbe of size 2n instead. Somewhat analogously we prove the following.\nTheorem 3 Every good configuration on Qd is coverable.\nIt is clear that Theorem 3 implies Theorem 1. It is also true that we\nneed only prove Theorem 3 in the case that C is sharp.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nProof of Theorem 3\n\nAs noted, we may assume that the configuration C is sharp. If C is open\nthen the appropriate pebbling step creates a sharp configuration of smaller\nsize. In this case we use induction on sharp configuration size. The base\ncase has support equal to the cube: it is a cover. Thus we may assume that\nthe configuration is closed.\nIf there is only one large vertex then we use induction on support size.\nThe base case has support size d + 1 and is easily coverable: only 1 +\nPd\n\ni=2\n\nd\ni\n\n\u0001 i\n2 = 3d \u2212 2d pebbles are needed on the large vertex and there\n\nare exactly (3d \u2212 (d + 1) + 1) \u2212 d = 3d \u2212 2d pebbles on it. In general,\nwe compare the configuration to the one obtained by removing a one and\nplacing two pebbles on the large vertex. Because the new configuration is\nalso sharp and has smaller support size it is coverable. Since it takes at\nleast two pebbles to cover the newly emptied vertex, the remaining pebbles\ncan cover all other empties. Thus those pebbles can still cover all other\nempties in the original configuration - that is, C is coverable. Thus we\nmay assume there are at least two large vertices.\nBecause the configuration is closed this means that the support size is\nat least |N (u)| + |N (v)| \u2212 |N (u) \u2229 N (v)| \u2265 2(n + 1) \u2212 2 = 2n, where N (x) is\nthe closed neighborhood of x. Hence, for d \u2264 2 the configuration is already\na cover. Now assume d = 3.\n\n6\n\n\fIf there are two antipodal large vertices then C is a cover. Otherwise\nif there are two adjacent large vertices then |\u03c3(C)| \u2265 6. We will assume\nthat there are just two large vertices in this case; it is simpler to make\nthe arguments with more large vertices. Suppose |\u03c3(C)| = 6, then |C| =\n33 \u22126+1 = 22. If the largest vertex has at least 13 pebbles then it alone can\ncover the two empties, so let's say it has at most 12 pebbles. This means\nthat the other large has at least 6 pebbles, meaning it can cover its closest\nempty vertex. Since the largest vertex must also have at least 6 pebbles,\nit can cover the remaining empty. It is even simpler to argue that such a\nconfiguration of support size 7 is coverable. Now we may assume there are\nno adjacent large vertices.\nFor the case of just two large vertices, one can argue along similar lines\nas above that configurations of support size 6 or 7 are coverable. For the\ncase of three large vertices the arguments are easier. A configuration having\nfour large vertices, none of which are adjacent or antipodal, is a cover. Now\nwe may assume that d \u2265 4, and we will argue by induction on d.\nWe use the natural labelling of V (Qd ) by binary d-tuples, with adjacent\nvertices determined by Hamming distance 1. For any coordinate j we can\ncut Qd into two copies of Qd\u22121 , the top copy T = Tj having j th coordinate\nequal to 1 and the bottom copy B = Bj having j th coordinate equal to 0.\nFor a given top/bottom cut of the cube, if both corresponding configurations CT and CB are good then we are done by induction. Thus we may\n7\n\n\fassume that every such cut has |CB | = 3n\u22121 \u2212 |\u03c3B | + 1 \u2212 \u2206 for some \u2206 > 0\n(by swapping 0 and 1 on a cut (coordinate) if necessary, we can make sure\nthat it is the bottom rather than the top that fails the condition). Hence\n|CT | = (3n \u2212 |\u03c3| + 1) \u2212 |CB |\n= (3n \u2212 |\u03c3| + 1) \u2212 (3n\u22121 \u2212 |\u03c3B | + 1 \u2212 \u2206)\n= (3n\u22121 \u2212 |\u03c3T | + 1) + (3n\u22121 + \u2206 \u2212 1) .\n\nSince n \u2265 4 we have 3n\u22122 \u2265 2n\u22121 \u2265 |\u03c3T |. Thus 3n\u22121 \u2265 3|\u03c3T | and so\n3n\u22121 \u2212 |\u03c3T | + 1 \u2265 2|\u03c3T |. Consider a the configuration RT of empties, ones\nand twos on T that is congruent mod 2 to CT and has the same support.\nIt has size at most 2|\u03c3T | \u2264 3n\u22121 \u2212 |\u03c3T | + 1 and is domininated by CT (that\nis, RT (x) \u2264 CT (x) for all x \u2208 T ). Thus the configuration ST = CT \u2212 RT is\neven and has size at least 3n\u22121 + \u2206 \u2212 1. Because C has at least two large\nvertices we have |\u03c3B | \u2265 2. Therefore 0 \u2264 |CB | \u2264 3n\u22121 \u2212 1 \u2212 \u2206, and so\n\u2206 \u2264 3n\u22121 \u2212 1. This means that 3n\u22121 + \u2206 \u2212 1 \u2265 2\u2206 and so \u2206 pebbles from\nST can be moved from T to B. This results in a good configuration on T\nand a sharp configuration on B, and the proof is finished by induction.\n\n4\n\nOpen Questions\n\nWe have seen in the case of cubes that there is a simple non-coverable\nconfiguration of size \u03b3(Qd ) \u2212 1. This follows the behavior of complete\n8\n\n\fgraphs and cubes, and so we reiterate a question first raised in [4].\nQuestion 4 Is it true that every graph G has a noncoverable configuration\nof size \u03b3(G) \u2212 1 that is simple?\nIf this is true then every graph G would have cover pebbling number \u03b3(G) =\nmaxv\u2208V (G)\n\nP\n\nx\u2208V (G)\n\n2dist(v,x) , where dist(v, x) is the distance between v\n\nand x.\nDefine the cover pebbling ratio of a class F of graphs as \u03c1(F ) = supG\u2208F \u03c1(G).\nWe noted that the class of complete graphs and paths has cover pebbling\nratio 2, and that the class of trees has cover pebbling ratio n/ lg n. Here\nwe discovered that the class of cubes has cover pebbling ratio n.58... .\nQuestion 5 Is there an infinite class of graphs whose cover pebbling ratio\nis either smaller than 2 or larger than n/ lg n?\nAnother interesting pursuit is the following.\nQuestion 6 Is there an appropriate graph invariant that identifies (rather\nthan characterizes) either large or small cover pebbling ratio?\nAs evidenced by paths, diameter is not such an invariant.\nGraham's nototious pebbling conjecture states that \u03c0(G\u2737H) \u2264 \u03c0(G)\u03c0(H)\nfor every pair of graphs G and H, where \u2737 is the cartesian product.\nQuestion 7 Is it true that every pair of graphs G and H satisfy \u03b3(G\u2737H) \u2264\n\u03b3(G)\u03b3(H)?\n9\n\n\fThis is true for cubes, and because of the lack of need in the cubes for a\nspecial property like 2-Pebbling, this may be a simpler question to resolve.\nFor those who like probabilistic questions see, for example, [1] for the\ndefinition of the pebbling threshold for a sequence of graphs. The cover\npebbling threshold is defined analogously.\nQuestion 8 Is the cover pebbling threshold for a graph sequence equal to\n\u0398(\u03c1\u03c4 )?\n\nReferences\n[1] A. Bekmetjev, G.
