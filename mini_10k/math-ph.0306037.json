We show that these systems are usual Ermakov\nsystems with the frequency function depending on the dynamical variables.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe basic idea behind the symmetry methods is to reduce the order of differential equations\nunder considerations as much as possible so that the integration can be done easily [11].\nIt is well known that a dynamical system is integrable if a sufficient number of sufficiently\nsimple (e.g. polynomial) independent first integrals can be found. The knowledge of a first\nintegral amounts to the reduction of the order of the integration procedure by one. For systems of N second order differential equations this order has to be counted as 2N . Ermakov\nsystems are time-dependent dynamical systems [9]. They contain one arbitrary function\nof time, the so-called frequency function, and two arbitrary homogeneous functions of\ndynamical variables. A trend in the latest developments on the subject is to focus attention on some special features of subclasses of generalized Ermakov systems in which the\nfrequency function may depend on time, the dynamical variables and their derivatives [5,\n6, 8]. These subclasses may be tailored to suit some particular applications or special\npurposes. A central feature of Ermakov systems is their property of always having a first\nintegral [4]. This invariant plays a central role in the linearization of Ermakov systems [2,\n6, 10]. A class of dynamical systems was presented by Athorne [1] which can be regarded\nas perturbations of the classical Kepler problem or of an autonomous Ermakov system.\nKepler\u2013Ermakov systems generalize the usual Ermakov systems while preserving the property of being amenable to linearization [1, 3, 6]. In the next section, we study the Lie\npoint symmetries of Kepler\u2013Ermakov systems. We find the Kepler\u2013Ermakov\u2013Lagrangian\nsystems possessing the sl(2, R) symmetry.\n\nCopyright c 2002 by A Karasu(Kalkanl\u0131) and H Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\n\n\f476\n\n2\n\nA Karasu(Kalkanl\u0131) and H Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m\n\nSymmetry generators\n\nSystems of second order differential equations often appear in classical mechanics.

So every solution of (1) can locally be written as q a = q a (\u03c6\u03b1 , t),\nwhere d\u03c6\u03b1 /dt = 0.\nWhen the operator A is written in the form of (2), we can write the infinitesimal\ngenerator of the Lie point symmetry admitted by (1) as\nX = \u03be qi, t\nIts extension is\n\n\u0001 \u2202\n\u0001 \u2202\n+ \u03b7a qi , t\n.\n\u2202t\n\u2202q a\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u1e8a = \u03be + \u03b7 a a +\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\n\u0012\n\nd\u03b7 a\nd\u03be\n\u2212 q\u0307 a\ndt\ndt\n\n(3)\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2202\n,\n\u2202 q\u0307 a\n\n(4)\n\nand the symmetry condition is\n[\u1e8a, A] = \u03bbA,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03bb is a non-constant factor, in general.

Here f and g are arbitrary functions\nof the indicated arguments and w is an arbitrary function of time. If H, f and g are zero,\nwe have a time-dependent harmonic oscillator which occurs in many practical contexts.\nIn the case that H is taken to be zero we have generalized Ermakov systems.\nIn order to calculate the Lie point symmetries of system (9) we consider the generator\nof the group of point transformations\nX = \u03be(x, y, t)\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03b71 (x, y, t)\n+ \u03b72 (x, y, t) .\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202y\n\n(10)\n\nBy inserting (9) into the symmetry condition (8) we obtain a polynomial equation in \u1e8b\nand \u1e8f. The coefficients of all monomials of the form \u1e8bm \u1e8f n must be identically zero. This\nyields the following system of partial differential equations satisfied by \u03be, \u03b71 and \u03b72 ,\n\u03bexx = \u03beyy = \u03bexy = 0,\n\u03b72xy \u2212 \u03betx = 0,\n\n\u03b71xx \u2212 2\u03betx = 0,\n\n\u03b72yy \u2212 2\u03bety = 0,\n\n\u03b71xy \u2212 \u03bety = 0,\n\n\u03b71yy = \u03b72xx = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere we use subscripts to denote partial derivatives.

A Noether symmetry\nis a Lie point transformation that leaves the action functional invariant up to an additive\nconstant [11]. It is also a Lie symmetry of the corresponding Euler\u2013Lagrange equations.\nIf\nX=\u03be\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ \u03b7 a a + (\u03b7\u0307 a \u2212 q\u0307 a \u03be\u0307) a ,\n\u2202t\n\u2202q\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\n(43)\n\n\fOn the Lie Symmetries of Kepler\u2013Ermakov Systems\n\n481\n\nis the generator of a Noether symmetry, then\n\u0015\n\u2202L\n\u2202L\n\u2212 L \u2212 \u03b7 k k + \u039b(q i , t)\n\u03c6 = \u03be q\u0307\nk\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\u2202 q\u0307\n\u0014\n\nk\n\n(44)\n\nis a first integral that satisfies X\u03c6 = 0. For the Lagrangian in (38) a Noether symmetry\ngenerator is G3 and the first integral determined by (44) is the Hamiltonian.\nFinally we calculate the generator of Ermakov invariant for the Lagrangian (38). In\ngeneral, if the Lagrangian L and a first integral \u03c6 of a dynamical system are known one\ncan determine the corresponding symmetry of dynamical character [11].
