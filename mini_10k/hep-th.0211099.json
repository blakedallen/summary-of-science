The unitary irreducible representation is characterized by two Casimir\ninvariants [m2 , j], i.e. the invariant mass square m2 and\nspin j of the particles. Extension of Wigner's idea to encompass unstable particles has been the subject of many\ninvestigations [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Since unstable particles\ndecay, probability is not conserved and this results in a\nnon-unitary irreducible representation for unstable particles.\nOf the many works carried out in this direction, they\ndiffer crucially in the basis employed for the representation space of unstable particles. Refs. [2, 7] use velocity\nbasis, whereas Refs. [3, 4, 5, 6] resort to momentum basis for representing the state vector. More specifically,\nRefs. [2, 7] define the 4-velocity p\u0302 which is related to the\n4-momentum p as [16]\n\u221a\np = s p\u0302 ,\n(1)\nwhere s is the invariant energy square (Mandelstam variable) of the scattering process. The invariant energy\nsquare may acquire complex value, whereas the 4-velocity\nis required to remain real. Ref. [7] introduces the additional requirement that the 4-velocity be independent of\ns [8]. We shall follow Ref. [8] and\u221arefer to the velocity representable in the form p\u0302 = p/ s as the minimally\ncomplex representation. The minimally complex representation has led to a few interesting consequences. It\nis the our objective to clarify the implications of these\nconsequences.\nIntuitively, since velocity are kinematically equivalent\nto momentum, using velocity as variable in the representation space should not lead to profound change in the\n\n\u2217 Current address: Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.\nEmail: batay@ph.utexas.edu\n\u2020 Current address: Department of Physics, Grinnell College, Grinnell, Iowa 50112, USA.\n\nformulation. However, though the representation is nonunitary, the minimally complex representation are able\nto keep the velocity p\u0302 and spin j real when the variable s is analytically continued into the complex plane\n[7]. This provides a clean analytic continuation of the\nscattering amplitude into the complex s-plane when we\nstudy resonance phenomena. On the other hand, complex momentum is inevitable when s becomes complex,\nsince momentum in principle cannot be rendered independent of s. This leads to many complex representations\nin the momentum basis [3, 4, 5, 6] which has no obvious\nphysical interpretation. This is an important reason for\nemploying velocity basis in the studies of unstable states.\nThe requirement that unstable states be transformable\nby a real Lorentz transformation to a rest system with\n4-momentum of the form,\n\np=\n\n\u221a\nsr (1, 0) ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere sr is complex, has motivated Ref. [2] to introduce real velocity to the representation space of unstable\nstates. We shall show that unstable states in the momentum basis in general cannot be transformed into a\nrest frame by a Lorentz transformation, even though a\nrest frame exists in principle. This shows that Lorentz\ncovariance is maintained for unstable states in the velocity basis and velocity basis is favorable over momentum\nbasis in the description of unstable states.\nHowever, we have to pay a price for this simplicity of\ndescription for unstable states in the velocity basis. By\nsetting the velocity to be independent of the invariant\nmass square of the scattering process, the unstable states\nare now endowed with a statistical meaning and devoid\nof the details of the process (kinematics) from which they\nare formed. This amounts to information loss. This fact\nwill be explained later in the main text. We will also\nput the meaning of the velocity variable of the unstable\nstates in proper perspective.\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nSEMIGROUP REPRESENTATION OF\nUNSTABLE STATES\n\nUnstable particles have long been known to be associated with the resonance poles of the S-matrix [10]. These\npoles are complex and their positions in the complex\nplane can be parameterized[17] in terms of the invariant mass square as sr = (M \u2212 i\u0393/2)2 , where M is the\nposition of the peak of the resonance with decay width\n\u0393.\nWith S-matrix as the starting point, analytically continuing the scattering amplitude into the complex plane\nallows the derivation of the Gamow vector, which is the\nunstable state associated with the complex pole of the\nS-matrix [7]. Gamow vector furnishes a semigroup irreducible representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group and is\ncharacterized by 2 numbers, [sr , j], the complex invariant mass square sr and the spin of the unstable particle or the partial wave in which the unstable particle is\nformed, j. In the frame work of Rigged Hilbert Space\n[11], the Gamow vector is represented by the following\nvector [18][7]\nZ \u221e\ni\n|p\u0302j3 [sj]\u2212 i\n|p\u0302j3 [sr j]\u2212 i =\n,\n(3)\nds\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221eII\ns \u2212 sr\nwhere p\u0302 is the space component of the 4-velocity and j3 is\nthe third component of the spin. The minus superscript\nindicates that the Gamow vector is analytically continued into the lower half plane and its time evolution is\nrestricted to the forward light cone. More properties of\nthe Gamow vector can be found in Refs. [7].\nSince the following discussion on the Lorentz transformation property of the unstable states is general and need\nnot be restricted to the Gamow vectors, we shall consider\nthe phenomenological generalization of Eq. (3) to intermediate states in a scattering process,[19] cf. Eq. (6)\nand (7) below. Intermediate states are transient states\nin scattering processes, which may or may not correspond\nto resonant states[20]. For instance, a state C may form\ntemporarily when particles a and b scatter into particles\nd and e, i.e.\na+b \u2192 C \u2192 d +e.\n\n(4)\n\nIn a decay chain with 3-body final states, an intermediate\nstates D may be formed as follows,\na+b\u2192c+D \u2192c+e+f.\n\n(5)\n\nLet us consider the superposition of energy eigenkets\nweighted by a function w(s) in the velocity basis,\nZ\nds w(s) |p\u0302j3 [sj]\u2212 i .\n(6)\nThe function w(s), for example, may be proportional to\nthe scattering amplitude. For the Gamow vector, w(s) \u223c\n1/(s \u2212 sr ), which is proportional to the relativistic BreitWigner amplitude. Eq. (6) integrates over all appropriate\n\nvalues of invariant energy square s according to w(s). The\ncorresponding superposition of energy eigenkets in the\nmomentum basis is\nZ\nds w\u2032 (s) |pj3 [sj]\u2212 i ,\n(7)\nwhich is weighted by the function w\u2032 (s).\n\nIII.\n\nLORENTZ COVARIANCE OF UNSTABLE\nSTATES IN THE VELOCITY BASIS\n\nAs pointed out in Ref. [2], a desirable property of\nthe vectors representing unstable states is their ability to\ntransform to the rest system under a Lorentz transformation. The vector in the velocity basis Eq. (6) satisfies this\nrequirement. To see this, we parameterize the standard\nboost as [12]\n\uf8eb 0\n\uf8f6\np\u0302\n\u2212p\u0302j\np\u0302i p\u0302j \uf8f8 , i, j = 1, 2, 3 . (8)\nL\u03bc\u03bd (p\u0302) = \uf8ed i i\np\u0302 \u03b4j \u2212\n1 + p\u03020\nUnder the Lorentz transformation L\u22121 (p\u0302) (a rotation free\nboost), the velocity vector Eq. (6) is transformed into its\nrest frame [7, 8],\nZ\nZ\nU [L\u22121 (p\u0302)] ds w(s)|p\u0302j3 [sj]\u2212 i = ds w(s)|0j3 [sj]\u2212 i .\n(9)\nwhere U is the unitary representation of the Lorentz\ntransformation. The 4-momentum of the transformed\nstate is given by Eq. (2). Note that the form of Eq. (6)\nis retained under the transformation. Hence we say that\nthe velocity vector is Lorentz covariant.\nComplication arises when we consider the Lorentz\ntransformation of the momentum vector in Eq. (7). Let\nus apply the Lorentz transformation L\u22121 (p\u0302) to the state\nvector. Even though all the constituent momentum kets\nunder the s integration in Eq. (7) have identical momentum p (the space components of the 4-momentum vector\np), but they have different invariant\n\u221a energy square when\ns changes. By definition p\u0302 = p/ s, hence for each different s1 6= s2 6= ..., the corresponding velocities are different\ntoo, i.e. p\u03021 6= p\u03022 6= .... Therefore, transforming a vector\nwith momentum p to its rest frame\nZ\nZ\nds w\u2032 (s) |pj3 [sj]\u2212 i \u2192 ds w\u2032 (s) |0j3 [sj]\u2212 i , (10)\ncan only be achieved with a series of different Lorentz\ntransformations, i.e. L\u22121 (p\u0302i ), where i = 1, \u221a\n2, 3, ..., each\nacting separately on |pj3 [si j]i, where p = si p\u0302i . This\nviolates the requirement of having only a single Lorentz\ntransformation to bring the momentum vector into its\nrest frame. Therefore, Eq. (7) is not a desirable representation vector for intermediate states.\n\n\f3\nThe complication in the transformation of momentum\nvector originates from the fact that the Lorentz transformation (8) is a function of the 4-velocity p\u0302, but not\nthe 4-momentum p. This complication does not arise for\nstable (asymptotic) states, in both the velocity basis as\nwell as momentum basis. This is because for stable particle, s = m2 is a constant, where m is the rest mass of\nthe stable particle. It also follows that the notion of a\nsuperposition of the energy eigenkets over the s variable\ndoes not arise in the case of stable particles.\nThe momentum vector Eq. (7) does not transform\ncovariantly in the momentum variable under a single\nLorentz transformation (since this will result in a superposition over the momentum variable), but the velocity\nvector Eq. (6) does. Even though in our discussion we\nhave used the minimally complex representation for the\nvelocity variable, but the result is independent of the\nfunctional dependence of the momentum on s. Hence\nin the representation space of unstable or intermediate\nstates, velocity is the preferred basis over momentum.\n\nIV. CONSISTENCY OF THE MINIMALLY\nCOMPLEX REPRESENTATION WITH THE\nKINEMATICS\n\nWhen we define the velocity variable through the minimally complex representation in Eq. (1), we have implicitly assumed that the velocity is independent of the\ninvariant energy square s, i.e. velocity is not a function\nof s. This choice is mathematically legitimate since out\nof the set of 5 variables {p0 , p, s} and with the off massshell constraints for unstable states p20 \u2212p2 = s, we choose\nthe set of 4 variables {p\u0302, s} to be independent. The time\ncomponent of the velocity is determined through the constraint p\u030220 \u2212 p\u03022 = 1.\nHowever, when we consider the kinematics of a scattering event, there seems to be an apparent contradiction\nwith the assumption of minimally complex representation\n[13]. Consider the kinematics of the resonance formation\nprocess[21] in Eq. (4). The rest mass of the stable particles a, b, d, e are labeled by mi , where i = a, b, d, e respectively. Suppose in the rest frame of particle a, it is\nbombarded by particle b which has velocity p\u0302b = \u03b3v =\n(\u03b3v, 0, 0), where\nv = |v| and \u03b3 is the usual dilation fac\u221a\ntor \u03b3 = 1/ 1 \u2212 v 2 . The 4-momentum of the unstable\nstate C, which equals the total 4-momentum of the system, is given by pC = pa + pb = (mb \u03b3 + ma , mb \u03b3v, 0, 0).\nThe invariant energy square of the system is s = p2C =\nm2a + m2b + 2ma mb \u03b3. The velocity of the intermediate\nstate can then be brought into the following form,\n1\n\n\u03bb 2 (s, m2a , m2b )\n|pC |\n\u221a\n,\n|p\u0302C | = \u221a =\ns\n2ma s\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the coefficient\n\u03bb(a, b, c) = a2 + b2 + c2 \u2212 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\n(12)\n\nfrequently occurs in kinematical expression [8, 15]. Since\nwe obtain a s-dependent velocity p\u0302C , one may question\nthe validity of introducing a s-independent velocity p\u0302\nthat is consistent with the kinematics.\nThis controversy arises in the carelessness of identifying the velocity vector Eq. (6) with the unstable state\noccurred in a specific scattering event. As is clear from\nthe Gamow vector, its construction requires information\non the scattering amplitude encoded in w(s), which is\nderived from a series of different scattering events that\nprobes through various values of s for the response of\nthe scattering amplitude. Thus, the Gamow vector is a\nstatistical representation (average sum weighted by w(s))\nfor the whole collection of scattering events, not just a\nspecific one.\nA statistical meaning is ingrained implicitly in the construction of the unstable states. Once the unstable states\nare formed, information on the details of the kinematics\nof each event prior to the formation of the unstable states\nare lost. However, the overall conservation of total momentum, total angular momentum and other conserved\nquantum numbers of the scattering process are still inherited by the unstable states [7]. It is in this sense that the\nGamow vector is a universal unstable state. Cares must\nbe taken in interpreting the velocity variable to avoid apparent contradiction with the kinematics of a scattering\nevent.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe show that the semigroup irreducible representation\nof the Poincar\u00e9 group for unstable states in the velocity\nbasis can be transformed into its rest system by a real\nLorentz transformation, while this is not true for the irreducible representation in the momentum basis. This\nis the consequent of 2 facts: (1) the Lorentz transformation is parameterized by velocity, and (2) to properly\ndescribe unstable states, a superposition of energy eigenkets over a range of invariant energy square is necessary.\nAs a result, unstable state transforms covariantly under\nLorentz transformation only in the velocity basis. This\ndistinction between velocity and momentum basis does\nnot exist when asymptotic states are considered, since\nthe invariant energy square s = m2 of stable particles are\nconstant. This finding advocates using velocity basis in\nthe studies of unstable particles, or intermediate states\nin general.\nIn scattering experiments, the existence of unstable\nstates can be reviewed only if the experiments probe\nacross an appropriate range of invariant energy square.\nDisconnected isolated events cannot review the underlying unstable state. Likewise, a mathematical description of unstable states has to involve the superposition of\neigenkets across a range of energy, weighted by a function\nproportional to the scattering amplitude. This construct\nendows the Gamow vector with a statistical meaning, and\nits velocity variable cannot be identified to the velocity\n\n\f4\nobtained from the kinematical consideration of a single\nscattering event.\nThe minimally complex representation has avoided\ncomplex momentum and complex spin representation of\nunstable particles. This simplicity in the description of\nunstable state has caused the loss of some information.\nExcept the overall conservation of the total 4-momentum,\ntotal angular momentum and conserved quantum numbers, the details of the process from which the unstable\nstates are formed are lost. This conforms to the notion of\nunstable states as indistinguishable particles that forget\nits history upon formation, and the formulation is able\nto put it on equal footing with stable particles.\n\n[1] E.
