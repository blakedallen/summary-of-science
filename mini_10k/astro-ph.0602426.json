These reveal a tandalizing picture of the physical conditions of the molecular gas in\nthese extraordinary galaxies (LFIR > 1012 L\u2299 ), with a diffuse phase dominating the low-J CO\nlines and a much denser and warmer phase dominating the CO 4-3 and 6-5 and all the HCN\nlines. Preliminary analysis finds the bulk of their dense (n > 105 cm\u22123 ) H2 gas reservoir to\nbe also warm Tk \u223c (60 \u2212 70)K, without any significant reservoir of dense and cold H2 gas.\nThis points to most of the dense gas in ULIRGs as the immediate \"fuel\" of their prodigious\nstar formation (SF) rates, without any SF-idle dense gas reservoir present in these rapidly\nevolving merger/starbursts. The CI J=1\u20130 emission was found to be a robust tracer of their\ntotal molecular gas mass under a large range of physical conditions, a potent alternative to the\nmuch weaker emission from the 13 CO isotopologue, and especially promising as an H2 tracer for\nsimilar objects at high redshifts.\nKeywords.
