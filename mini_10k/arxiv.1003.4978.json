Introduction\nThe Bouchaud trap model (B.T.M.) is a continuous time random walk X on a graph G with\n\nrandom jump rates. To each vertex x of G we assign a positive number \u03c4x where (\u03c4x )x\u2208G is an\ni.i.d. sequence such that\nlim u\u03b1 P[\u03c4x \u2265 u] = 1\n\nu\u2192\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nwith \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1). This means that the distribution of \u03c4x has heavy tails. Each visit of X to x \u2208 G\nlasts an exponentially distributed time with mean \u03c4x . Let S(k) be the time of the k-th jump of X.\n(S(k), k \u2208 N) is called the clock process of X. Let Yk := X(S(k)) be the position of X after the\n\nk-th jump. (Yk : k \u2208 N) is called the embedded discrete time random walk associated to X.\n\nThis model was introduced by J.-P. Bouchaud in [9] and has been studied by physicists as a\ntoy model for the analysis of the dynamics of some complex systems such as spin-glasses. More\nprecisely, each vertex x of G corresponds to a metastable state of the complex system, and X\n\nrepresents the trajectory of the system over its phase space. One of the phenomena that this\nmodel has helped to understand is that of aging, a characteristic feature of the slow dynamics of\nmany metastable systems. For an account of the physical literature on the B.T.M. we refer to [10].\nThe model has also been studied by mathematicians on different graphs, exhibiting a variety\nof behaviors. In [11], Fontes, Isopi and Newman analyze the one-dimensional case (G = Z)and\nDate: June 4, 2018.\n1\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n2\n\nwhere the walk X is symmetric. They obtain a scaling limit for X which is called the FontesIsopi-Newman (F.I.N.) singular diffusion. This diffusion is a speed measure change of a Brownian\nmotion by a random, purely atomic measure \u03c1, where \u03c1 is the Stieltjes measure associated to\nan \u03b1-stable subordinator. Different aging regimes for the one-dimensional case where found by\nBen-Arous and C\u011brn\u00fd in [4]. In higher dimensions (G = Zd , d \u2265 2), the symmetric model has a\nbehavior completely different to the one-dimensional case, as shown by Ben Arous and C\u011brn\u00fd in\n[6], and by Ben Arous, C\u011brn\u00fd and Mountford in [8]. In these papers, a scaling limit and aging\nresults where obtained for X. The scaling limit is called fractional kinetic process (F.K.P) which is\na time-change of a d-dimensional Brownian motion by the inverse of an \u03b1-stable subordinator. In\n[1] and [2] Ben Arous, Bovier and Gayrard obtained aging properties of the model on the complete\ngraph. A study of this walk for a wider class of graphs can be found on [7]. For a general account\non the mathematical study of the model, we refer to [5].\nThe difference between the one dimensional case and the model in higher dimensions can be\nPk\u22121\nunderstood as follows. We can express the clock process S(k) of X as S(k) = i=0 \u03c4Yi ei , where\n\nthe ei are standard i.i.d. exponential random variables. Thus, the increments of S(k) are the\ndepths of the traps (\u03c4x )x\u2208G as sampled by Yk . In the model in dimensions higher than two, the\nembedded discrete time random walk Yk is transient (the case d = 2 is more delicate). Thus Yk\n\nwill sample each trap \u03c4x a finite number of times. That implies that S(k) does not have long range\ninteractions with its past and its scaling limit will be a Markovian process, which is an \u03b1-stable\nsubordinator. On the other hand, in the one-dimensional symmetric B.T.M., we have that the\nembedded discrete time random walk Yk is recurrent. Thus Yk will sample each trap \u03c4x an infinite\nnumber of times. In this case, S(k) has long range interactions with its past and its scaling limit\nwill be non-Markovian. Furthermore, the clock process S(k) will converge to the local time of a\nBrownian motion integrated against the random measure \u03c1. Here \u03c1 plays the role of a scaling limit\nfor the environment (\u03c4x )x\u2208Z .\nIt is natural to ask if we can find intermediate behaviors between the transient case (d \u2265 1)\nand the recurrent case (d = 1): if we introduce a drift to the one-dimensional B.T.M., note that\nthe embedded discrete random walk becomes transient. Thus, intermediate behaviors between the\ntransient and the recurrent case might appear when one analyzes a sequence of one-dimensional\nB.T.M.'s with a drift that decreases to 0 as we rescale the walks. In this paper we study this\nquestion, showing that the speed of decay of the drift sets the long-term behavior of the model and\nexhibiting a sharp phase transition in terms of the type of limiting processes obtained. We next\ndescribe with more precision the way in which we define the B.T.M. with drift and the results that\nare obtained in this paper.\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n3\n\nFor each \u01eb > 0, denote by X \u01eb the B.T.M. on Z where the transition probabilities of the embedded\ndiscrete time random walk are\n\n1+\u01eb\n2\n\nto the right and\n\n1\u2212\u01eb\n2\n\nto the left. We will call this process\n\nthe B.T.M. with drift \u01eb. For a \u2265 0, consider a rescaled sequence of B.T.M's with drift n\u2212a ,\n\u2212a\n\n(ha (n)X n\n\n(tn); t \u2265 0), indexed by n, where ha (n) is an appropriate space scaling depending on\n\na. We will see that as the drift decays slowly (small a), the sequence of walks converges to the\ninverse of an \u03b1-stable subordinator, whereas if the drift decays fast (large a) the limiting process\nis the F.I.N. diffusion. As these two posibilities are qualitatively different, we are led to think that\nthere is either, a gradual interpolation between these two behaviors as the speed of decay changes,\nor a sharp transition between them as the speed of decay changes. We establish that there is a\nsharp transition between the two scaling limits, that there is a critical speed of decay where a\nnew, previously, process appears and that the transition happens at a = \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1). As the main\ntheorem of this paper, we prove that, depending on the value of a, there are three different scaling\nlimits:\n\u2022 Supercritical case (a < \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1)). The sequence of walks converges to the inverse of\nan \u03b1-stable subordinator.\n\n\u2022 Critical case (a = \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1)). The sequence of walks converges to a process which is a\nspeed measure change of a Brownian motion with drift that we will call the drifted F.I.N.\ndiffusion.\n\u2022 Subcritical case (a > \u03b1/(\u03b1+1)). The sequence of walks converges to the F.I.N. diffusion.\nThe case a = 0 (contained in the supercritical case), which corresponds to a constant drift, was\nalready addressed by Zindy in [15].\nLet us now make a few remarks concerning the proof of our main theorem. The strategy of\nthe proof for the supercritical case is a generalization of the method used in [15] and relies on the\nanalysis of the sequence of processes of first hitting times (Hbn (x); x \u2208 [0, nS]) (S is fixed, b > 0)\ndefined as\n\n\u2212b\n\nHbn (x) := inf{t : X n (t) \u2265 x}.\n\n(2)\n\nWe show that these processes (properly rescaled) converge to an \u03b1-stable subordinator. From that,\nit follows that the maximum of the walks converges to the inverse of an \u03b1-stable subordinator.\nThis part of the proof requires some care, because, as we are working with a sequence of walks\nwith variable drift, we cannot apply directly the methods used in [15]. It turns out that we have to\nchoose b properly to obtain a sequence of walks with the desired drift as we invert the hitting time\nprocesses. Then, it is easy to pass from the maximum of the walk to the walk itself. In [11] The\nproof corresponding to the critical case follows the arguments used by [11]. There they express\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n4\n\nrescaled, symmetric one-dimensional B.T.M.'s as speed measure changes of a Brownian motion\ntrough a random speed measure. But here we are working with asymmetric walks, so we cannot\nwork with the expression used there. To treat the asymmetry of the walks, we use a Brownian\n\u2212\u03b1/(\u03b1+1)\n\nmotion with drift instead of a Brownian motion. That is, we express each walk X n\n\nas a\n\nspeed measure change of a Brownian motion with drift, and then prove convergence of the sequence\nof speed measures to \u03c1. The latter is achieved by means of a coupling of the environments. In the\nsubcritical case, although we obtain the same scaling limit as in [11] (a F.I.N. diffusion), again,\nbecause of the asymmetry of the model, we cannot work with the expression used there. We deal\nwith this obstacle using, besides a random speed measure, a scaling function. That is, we express\nthe rescaled walks as time-scale changes of a Brownian motion. Then we prove that the scale\nchange can be neglected and show convergence of the sequence of speed measures to the random\nmeasure \u03c1.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In section 2 we give the definition of the model and\nstate our main results. There we also give simple heuristic arguments to understand the transition\nat a = \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1). In section 3 we obtain the behavior for the supercritical case, and in section 4\nwe obtain the scaling limit for the critical case. The behavior for the subcritical case is obtained\nin section 5.\nFinally, we would like to mention that while preparing the final version of this article we have\nlearned that Theorem (2.1) has been independently obtained by Gantert, M\u00f6rters and Wachtel\n[12]. There, they also obtain aging results for the B.T.M. with vanishing drift.\nAcknowledgements: The author was supported by a fellowship of the National Commission\non Science and Technology of Chile (Conicyt)#29100243.

Given any locally finite measure \u03bc on R, denote\nZ\nl(s, y)\u03bc(dy),\n\u03c6\u03bc (s) :=\nR\n\nand its right continuous generalized inverse by\n\n\u03c8\u03bc (t) := inf {s > 0 : \u03c6\u03bc (s) > t}.\nThe right continuous generalized inverse exists by definition, is increasing and, as its name\nindicates, it is a right continuous function. Then we define the speed measure change of B with\nspeed measure \u03bc, X(\u03bc)(t) as\nX(\u03bc)(t) := B(\u03c8\u03bc (t)).\n\n(5)\n\nWe also need to define speed measure changes of a drifted Brownian motion.

Now we are in conditions to state the main\nresult of this paper.\nTheorem 2.1. For all T > 0:\n(i) If a < \u03b1/(\u03b1+ 1) we have that (X (n,a) (t); t \u2208 [0, T ]) converges in distribution to (V\u03b1\u22121 (t); t \u2208\n(0, T )) in (D[0, T ], U ) where V\u03b1\u22121 is the right continuous generalized inverse of V\u03b1 .\n\n(ii) If a = \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1) we have that (X (n,a) (t); t \u2208 [0, T ]) converges in distribution to the drifted\nF.I.N. diffusion (Z\u0303(t); t \u2208 [0, T ]) on (D[0, T ], U ).\n\n(iii) If a > \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1) we have that (X (n,a) (t); t \u2208 [0; T ]) converges in distribution to the F.I.N.\ndiffusion (Z(t); t \u2208 [0, t]) on (D[0, T ], U ).\nWe present heuristic arguments to understand the transition at a =\n\n\u03b1\n1+\u03b1 .\n\nFirst we analyze a\n\n\u01eb\n\nsequence of discrete time random walks. Let (S (i), i \u2208 N) be a simple asymmetric random walk\nPi\nwith drift \u01eb, S \u01eb (i) := k=1 b\u01ebk , where (b\u01ebk )i\u2208N is an i.i.d. sequence of random variables with: P[b\u01ebk =\n1] =\n\n1+\u01eb\n2 ;\n\nP[b\u01ebk = \u22121] =\n\n1\u2212\u01eb\n2 .\n\nWe want to find the possible scaling limits of (S \u01eb(n) (in); i \u2208 [0, T ]),\n\ndepending on the speed of decay of \u01eb(n) to 0 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\nWe couple the sequence of walks S \u01eb(n) in the following way: Let (Ui )i\u2208N be an i.i.d. sequence\n\nof uniformly distributed random variables taking values on [0, 1]. We require that S \u01eb(n) takes\n\u01eb(n)\n\nhis i-th step to the right (bi\n\n= 1) if Ui >\n\n1\u2212\u01eb(n)\n2\n\nand to the left otherwise. For each walk,\n\nwe can decompose the steps into two groups: the first group is given by the steps i such that\n1\u2212\u01eb(n)\n2\n\n< Ui <\n\n1+\u01eb(n)\n2\n\nand the second group consists of the remaining steps. We can think that\n\nthe first group of steps takes account of the drift effect and the second one takes account of the\nsymmetric fluctuations of the walk.\nIf the walk has given n steps, then the first group has about n\u01eb(n) steps, and the second group\n\u221a\nhas fluctuations of order n. It is obvious that the drift effect will dominate the behavior if\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n7\n\n\u221a\nn = o(\u01eb(n)). In this case we will have a ballistic (deterministic) process as a scaling limit. If\n\u221a\n\u01eb(n) = o( n) the fluctuations will dominate and we will have a Brownian motion as scaling limit.\n\u221a\nFinally the two behaviors will be of the same order if \u01eb(n) \u2248 n, and a Brownian motion with\ndrift will be the scaling limit.\n\nThe same reasoning can now be used to understand the change of behavior at a = \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1)\n\u2212a\n\nfor the sequence of walks (X n\n\n(tn), t \u2208 [0, T ])n\u2208N . In order to apply the precedent arguments we\n\u2212a\n\nfirst have to estimate the number of steps that X n\n\u2212a\n\ntake T = 1. First, suppose that X n\n\nhas given up to time T n. To simplify we\n\n(n) is of order nu , where u is to be found. We know that\n\nafter k steps, a walk with drift n\u2212a is approximately on site kn\u2212a , so, it takes about nu+a steps\n\u2212a\n\nto be on site nu . Thus, we can also deduce that at time n, X n\n\nhas visited approximately na\nP u\ntimes each site. As the distribution of \u03c4i satisfies (4), then the sum ni=0 \u03c4i is of the same order\nthat max{0\u2264i\u2264nu } \u03c4i , and both are of order nu/\u03b1 . We can estimate the time needed to arrive at nu\n\nas the depth of the deepest trap found (\u2248 nu/\u03b1 ) multiplied by the number of visits to that trap\n\u2212a\n\nu\n\n(\u2248 na ). This gives that n \u2248 n \u03b1 +a . But, we know, by definition, that X n\n\narrives at the site nn/u\n\napproximately at time n. It follows that 1 = (u/\u03b1) + a, which yields u = (1 \u2212 a)\u03b1. This means\n\u2212a\n\nthat the number of steps that X n\n\nhas given up to time n is of order n(1\u2212a)\u03b1+a .\n\u2212a\n\nAgain, we can decompose the steps of X n\n\ninto two groups. The first group accounts for the\n\ndrift effect, and the second one accounts for the fluctuations. The first group will have approximately n\u2212a+[(1\u2212a)\u03b1+a] steps and the second group will give a contribution to the position of order\nn\n\n(1\u2212a)\u03b1+a\n2\n\n. Now it is easy to see that the ballistic behavior and the fluctuations will be of the same\n\norder i.f.f. [(1 \u2212 a)\u03b1 + a]/2 = (1 \u2212 a)\u03b1 or a = \u03b1/(1 + \u03b1).\n3. The Supercritical Regime\nThe proof for the constant drift case (a = 0) in [15] is roughly as follows: first he prove that the\nsequence of rescaled first hitting times, (n\u22121/\u03b1 inf{s \u2265 0 : X \u01eb (ns) \u2265 x} : x \u2265 0), converges to an \u03b1stable subordinator. Then, using that the right continuous generalized inverse of the process of first\nhitting times is the maximum of X \u01eb (t), he can deduce that (max{n\u22121 X \u01eb (n1/\u03b1 s) : s \u2264 t} : t \u2265 0)\nconverges to the inverse of an \u03b1-stable subordinator. Finally he shows that the walk and its\nmaximum are close.\nFor the proof of part (i) of theorem 2.1 we cannot follow the proof of [15] in a straightforward way: suppose we show that a properly rescaled sequence of first hitting time processes\n(pa (n)Han (nx) : x \u2208 R+ ) (where pa (n) is an appropriate scaling) converges to an \u03b1-stable subor\u2212a\n\ndinator. Then, by inverting the processes, we get that the sequence (max{n\u22121 X n\n\n(pa (n)\u22121 s) :\n\ns \u2264 t} : t \u2208 R+ ) converges to the inverse of an \u03b1-stable subordinator. But we are searching a\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\u2212a\n\nlimit for (max{da (n)X n\n\n8\n\n(tn) : t \u2208 R+ }) (where da (n) is appropriate space scaling). That is,\n\nwe want to obtain the limit of a sequence of rescaled walks where the drift decays as n\u2212a when\nthe time is rescaled by n. But when we invert (pa (n)Han (nx) : x \u2208 R+ ), we obtain the sequence\n\u2212a\n\n(max{n\u22121 X n\n\n(pa (n)\u22121 s) : s \u2264 t} : t \u2265 0), which is a sequence of maximums of rescaled walks in\n\nwhich the drift decays as n\u2212a when the time is rescaled as pa (n)\u22121 .\n\nTo solve this, we will prove that the limit of (qa (n)Hbn\u2217 (nx) : x \u2208 R+ ) is an \u03b1-stable subordinator,\n\nwhere qa (n) is an appropriate scaling and b\u2217 sets an appropriate drift decay and depends on a.\n\u2212b\u2217\n\nInverting, we will obtain that (max{n\u22121 X n\n\n(qa (n)\u22121 s) : s \u2264 t} : t \u2265 0) converges to an \u03b1-stable\n\nsubordinator. As we have said, we want the limit of a sequence of rescaled walks with a drift that\ndecays as n\u2212a as the time parameter is rescaled by n. Hence, when the time parameter is rescaled\n\u2217\n\nas qa (n)\u22121 , the drift should rescale as qa (n)a . Thus we need to choose b\u2217 so that n\u2212b = qa (n)a .\nBut we know that qa (n) is the appropriate scaling for (Hbn\u2217 (nx) : x \u2208 R+ ). Hence, qa (n) must be\n\u2212b\u2217\n\nthe order of magnitude of Hbn\u2217 (n). That is qa (n) is of the order of the time that the walk X n\nneeds to reach n.\n\u2212b\u2217\n\nWe now give a heuristic argument to find qa (n) and b\u2217 . When X n\nit has an order kn\n\n\u2212b\u2217\n\n. So it takes about n\n\nb\u2217 +1\n\n(t) has given k steps,\n\nsteps to be on site n. We can think that the\n\u2217\n\nnumber of visits to each site x is evenly distributed. Then each site is visited about nb times\n\u2212b\u2217\n\nbefore X n\n\nhits n. The time that the walks needs to reach n is of the order of the time spent\n\nin the largest trap. Thus we can estimate the total time spent by the walk as the depth of the\ndeepest trap (which is of order n\u22121/\u03b1 ) multiplied by the number of visits to that trap. This gives\n\u2212b\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\na time of order n1/\u03b1+b . What the previous arguments show is that X n\nt\u2248n\n\n1/\u03b1+b\u2217\n\n(qa (n) \u2248 n\n\n1/\u03b1+b\u2217\n\n(t) arrives at n at time\n\u2217\n\n). But at that time we want to analyze a walk of drift (n1/\u03b1+b )\u2212a .\n\nThat is, we need that a(1/\u03b1 + b\u2217 ) = b\u2217 . In this way we find that b\u2217 := a/[(1 \u2212 a)\u03b1].\n3.1. The embedded discrete time walk. For each natural n, the clock processes S n is defined\n\u2212b\u2217\n\nas S n (0) := 0.

Then\n\nwe have that \u039e(x, k) = q + p\u039e(x + 1, k)\u039e(x, k) and that \u039e(k \u2212 2, k) = q. These observations give a\ndifference equation and an initial condition to compute \u039e(x, k).

We present the proof of part (i) of\nTheorem 2.1 using lemma 3.2 and devote the rest of the section to the proof of lemma 3.2.\n3.2. Proof of (i) of Theorem 2.1. Let us denote\n\u2212b\u2217\n\nX\u0304 n (t) := n\u22121 max{X n\n\n\u2217\n\n(sn(1/\u03b1)+b ); s \u2208 [0, t]}.\n\nFirst we will prove convergence in distribution of X\u0304 n to the (right continuous generalized)\n\u03c0\u03b1\ninverse of ( sin(\u03c0\u03b1)\n)\u22121/\u03b1 V\u03b1 in the uniform topology.

Define\n\u2217\n\nC(T, S)n := {H (n) (S) \u2265 T n(1/\u03b1)+b }.\nThen, we have that, on C(T, S)n , the right continuous generalized inverse of (H (n) (s); s \u2208\n\n[0, S]) is (X\u0304 n (t); t \u2208 [0, T ]). Let T > 0 be fixed, by Lemma 3.2, we know that we can choose S\n\nbig enough so that limn\u2192\u221e P[C(T, S)n ] is as close to 1 as we want. Let D\u2191 [0, T ] be the subset\n\nof D[0, T ] consisting of the increasing functions. By corollary 13.6.4 of [14], the inversion map\nfrom (D\u2191 [0, T ], M1 ) to (D\u2191 [0, T ], U ) is continuous at strictly increasing functions.

So we can apply corollary 13.6.4 of [14] and deduce convergence\n\u03c0\u03b1\n)\u22121/\u03b1 V\u03b1 in the uniform topology. As we have\nin distribution of X\u0304 n to the inverse of ( sin(\u03c0\u03b1)\n\nsaid previously, the inverse of (H (n) (s); s \u2208 [0, S]) is (X\u0304 n (t); t \u2208 [0, T ]) in C(T, S)n .

We can decompose the trajectory of Y \u01eb(n) up to \u03b6n (\u230anuK \u230b) into three\nparts. The first one is the trajectory up to the time \u03b6n (\u230anuK\u22121 \u2212 \u03bd(T n)\u230b), the second one is the\ntrajectory between times \u03b6n (\u230anuK\u22121 \u2212 \u03bd(T n)\u230b) and \u03b6n (\u230anuK\u22121 \u230b), finally, the third part is the\n\ntrajectory starting from time \u03b6n (\u230anuK\u22121 \u230b) up to time \u03b6n (\u230anuK \u230b).

But in A(T n) the\n\nwalk never backtracks a distance larger than \u03bd(T n), so, the time spent in the second part of\nthe decomposition is negligible. The fact that in A(T n) the walk never backtracks a distance\nlarger than \u03bd(T n) also implies that, conditional on A(T n), the first and the third parts of the\ndecomposition of the trajectory corresponds to independent walks in independent environments.\nPK\nSo E[exp( i=1 \u2212\u03b2i (H (n) (ui ) \u2212 H (n) (ui\u22121 )))] can be expressed as\n#\n\"\nK\u22121\nh\ni\nX\n(n)\n(n)\n\u2212\u03b2i (H (ui ) \u2212 H (ui\u22121 )) E\u230anuK\u22121 \u230b exp \u2212\u03b2K (H (n) (ui ) \u2212 H (n) (ui\u22121 )) + o(1)\nE exp\ni=1\n\nwhere o(1) is taking account of the time spent in the second part of the decomposition of the\ntrajectory and of A(T n)c .\n\nThe strong Markov property of Y \u01eb(n) applied at the stopping time \u03b6n (\u230anuK\u22121 \u230b) and translational\n\ninvariance of the environment give that Hbn\u2217 (nui ) \u2212 Hbn\u2217 (nui\u22121 ) is distributed as Hbn\u2217 (nsn (K))\nwhere sn (K) =\n\n\u230auK n\u230b\u2212\u2308uK\u22121 n\u2309\n.\nn\n\nIterating this procedure K \u2212 2 times we reduce the problem to\n\nthe computation of one-dimensional Laplace transforms.

But to treat the\nasymmetry of the model we will use a Brownian motion with drift instead of a Brownian motion.\nWe use the existence of a bi-continuous version of the local time for a Brownian motion with drift.\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n16\n\n4.1. The construction of the walks. Recall the definition of X\u0303(\u03bc) given in display (6). Let s\nbe a real number and define\n\u03bc :=\n\nX\n\nvi \u03b4si .\n\ni\u2208(Z)\n\nThen X\u0303(\u03bc) is a homogeneus Markov process with sZ as its state space. The transition probabilities and jump rates of X\u0303(\u03bc) can be computed from the positions and weights of the atoms\nusing the generator L of C(t)\n1 d2 f\ndf\n+\n.\n(14)\n2 dx2\ndx\nThe arguments we will give below are an adaptation of the reasoning used by Stone in [13]. For\nLf :=\n\neach i let \u03b7si be the time of the first jump of X\u0303(\u03bc) started at si. By construction we will have that\n\u03b7si = vi l\u0303(\u03c3s , 0), where \u03c3s is the hitting time of (\u2212s, s) by C(t). Using the strong Markov property\nfor C(t) we can deduce that \u03b7si is exponentially distributed. It is easy to see that its mean is\nvi E[l\u0303(\u03c3s , 0)]. Denote by pt (x) the density at site x of the distribution of C(t) absorbed at {\u2212s, s}.\nUsing that l\u0303(\u03c3s , 0) := \u01eb\u22121 lim\u01eb\u21920 m(t \u2208 [0, \u03c3s ] : C(t) \u2208 [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb]) and applying Fubini's Theorem we\nR\u03c3\nfind that E[l\u0303(\u03c3s , 0)] = \u01eb\u22121 lim\u01eb\u21920 0 s P[C(t) \u2208 [\u2212\u01eb, \u01eb]]dt. Then we find that\nZ \u221e\nE[l\u0303(\u03c3s , 0)] =\npt (0)dt.\n0\n\nWe also know that\n\nR\u221e\n0\n\npt (0)dt = f (0), where f is the Green function of (14) with Dirichlet\n\nconditions on {\u2212s, s}. That is, f is the continuous function that satisfies\n1 d2 f\ndf\n+\n= \u2212\u03b40 and f (s) = f (\u2212s) = 0.\n2 dx2\ndx\n\nWe know that the general solution to\n\n2\n1d g\n2 dx2\n\n+\n\ndg\ndx\n\n= 0 is g = C1 exp(\u22122x) + C2 . This and the\n\nconstraints on f give that\nexp(\u22122s) + 1\n.\n(15)\n1 \u2212 exp(\u22122s)\nFor the computation of the respective transition probabilities we can use again the generator\nE[\u03b7si ] = vi\u22121\n\nL. Let g : [\u2212s, s] \u2192 R be a continuous function such that\n\n2\n1d g\n2 dx2\n\n+\n\ndg\ndx\n\n= 0 and g(\u2212s) = 0, g(s) = 1.\n\nUsing It\u014d's formula, we find that that g(C(t)) is a martingale. By the optional stopping theorem\nwith the stopping time \u03c3s we find that the probability that the walk takes his first step to the\nright is g(0). We can use the constraints on g to see that\nP[X\u0303(\u03bc)(\u03b7si ) = s(i + 1)] =\n\nexp(2s)\n.\n1 + exp(2s)\n\n(16)\n\nThe proof of part (ii) of Theorem (2.1) will rely strongly on the following proposition.\nProposition 4.1. Let (\u03bdn )n\u2208N be a sequence of measures that converges vaguely to \u03bd, a measure whose support is R. Then the corresponding processes (X\u0303(\u03bdn )(t), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T ) converges to\n(X\u0303(\u03bd)(t), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T ) in distribution in (D[0, T ], U ).\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n17\n\nFor the case where the underlying process is a Brownian motion, the proof of this fact can\n \u0303 For each fixed t, l\u0303\nbe found in [13]. We will use the continuity properties for the local time l.\nis continuous and of compact support in x. Then, the vague convergence of \u03bdn to \u03bd implies the\nalmost sure convergence of \u03c6\u0303\u03bd (t) to \u03c6\u0303\u03bd (t). As  \u0303l is continuous in t, we obtain continuity of \u03c6\u0303\u03bd\nn\n\nn\n\nand of \u03c6\u0303\u03bd . That, plus the fact that the \u03c6\u0303\u03bdn are non-decreasing implies that that \u03c6\u0303\u03bdn converges\nuniformly to \u03c6\u0303\u03bd . The function \u03c6\u0303\u03bd is almost surely strictly increasing, because the support of \u03bd is\nR. Now we can apply corollary 13.6.4 of [14] to obtain that \u03c8\u0303\u03bdn converges uniformly to \u03c8\u0303\u03bd . That\nplus the continuity of the Brownian paths yields the lemma.\n4.2. The coupled walks. To prove part (ii) of Theorem 2.1, we will use Proposition 4.1. That\nis we want to show that each walk (X (n,a) (t); t \u2208 [0, \u221e]) can be expressed as a speed measure\n\nchange of C(t), and then use convergence of the measures to get convergence of the processes. The\n\nproblem is that we are dealing with a sequence of random measures, and the proposition deals only\nwith deterministic measures. To overcome this obstacle we can construct a coupled sequence of\nrandom measures (\u03c1n )n\u2208N , such that (X\u0303(\u03c1n )(t); t \u2208 [0, \u221e]) is distributed as (X (n,a) (t); t \u2208 [0, \u221e])\n\nand that (\u03c1n )n\u2208N converges almost surely vaguely to \u03c1, where \u03c1 is the random measure defined in\n(7) such that Z\u0303 = X\u0303[\u03c1]. This section is devoted to the construction of the coupled measures.\n\nWe recall that V\u03b1 is an \u03b1-stable subordinator. To make the construction clearer, we will first\nsuppose that \u03c40 is equidistributed with the positive \u03b1-stable distribution V\u03b1 (1). Let us consider\nthe strictly increasing process (\u1e7c\u03c1 (t); t \u2208 R) given by \u1e7c\u03c1 (t) := \u03c1[0, t] if t \u2265 0 and \u1e7c\u03c1 (t) := \u2212\u03c1[t, 0)\nif t < 0. It is a known fact from the theory of Levy processes that \u1e7c\u03c1 (t) is a two sided \u03b1-stable\nsubordinator. We now use this process to construct the coupled sequence of random measures\n(\u03c1n )n\u2208N as\n\u03c1n :=\n\nX\n\nn\u22121/(1+\u03b1) \u03c4in \u03b4sn i ,\n\ni\n\nwhere sn :=\n\n1\n2\n\nlog\n\nn\u2212a +1\n1\u2212n\u2212a\n\nand\n\n\u03c4in := n1/(1+\u03b1) (\u1e7c\u03c1 (n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) (i + 1)) \u2212 \u1e7c\u03c1 (n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) i)).\n\n(17)\n\nObserve that (\u03c4in )i\u2208Z is an i.i.d. sequence distributed like \u03c40 , so that using (16) and (15) we\nsee that X\u0303(\u03c1n ) is a walk with drift n\u22121/\u03b1 taking values in sn Z. The latter means that X\u0303(\u03c1n ) is\n\u03b1\n\ndistributed like sn n 1+\u03b1 X (n,a) . The key observation here is that the scaling factor sn satisfies\nsn n\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) \u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(18)\n\nSo, we just have to show that X\u0303(\u03c1n ) converges to X\u0303(\u03c1), because (18) implies that if X\u0303(\u03c1n )\nconverges to X\u0303(\u03c1), so sn n\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) X\u0303(\u03c1n ) does. With (18) in mind it is easy to prove that the\nsequence of measures (\u03c1n ) converges almost surely vaguely to \u03c1. Suppose that a < b are real\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n18\n\nnumbers and that V\u03c1 is continuous at a and b, then\n\u03c1n ((a, b]) = V\u03c1 (n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) \u230aa/sn \u230b) \u2212 V\u03c1 (n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) (\u230ab/sn \u230b + 1)).\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nBut using (18) it is clear that n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) \u230aa/sn \u230b \u2192 a and n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) \u230ab/sn \u230b \u2192 b. Then the\ncontinuity of V\u03c1 at a and b implies that \u03c1n ((a, b])\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c1(a, b], and we have proves the vague\n\nconvergence of \u03c1n to \u03c1.\nSuppose now that \u03c40 is not a positive \u03b1-stable random variable. Then, we can follow Section\n(\u01eb)\n\n3 of [11]. There they construct constants c\u01eb and functions g\u01eb such that \u03c4i\n\nis distributed like \u03c40 ,\n\nwhere\n(\u01eb)\n\n\u03c4i\n\n:= c\u22121\n\u01eb g\u01eb (\u1e7c\u03c1 (\u01eb(i + 1)) \u2212 \u1e7c\u03c1 (\u01ebi)).\n\n(19)\n\nLemma 3.1 of [11] says that\ng\u01eb (y) \u2192 y as \u01eb \u2192 0.\n\n(20)\n\nAs \u03c40 satisfies (4) and using the construction of c\u01eb in Section 3 of [11], we can deduce that\nc\u01eb \u223c \u01eb1/\u03b1\n\n(21)\n\nDefine\n(n(\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)) )\n\n\u03c4in := \u03c4i\n\n(22)\n\nand again\n\u03c1n :=\n\nX\n\nn\u22121/(1+\u03b1) \u03c4in \u03b4sn i .\n\ni\n\nThen, by definition (19), X\u0303(\u03c1n ) is a walk with drift n\u22121/\u03b1 taking values in sn Z. Using (20),\n(21) and (18) we can see that P-a.s. \u03c1n \u2192 \u03c1 vaguely.\n5. The Subcritical Regime\nWe will prove that if a > \u03b1/(1 + \u03b1), then (X (n,a) ; t \u2208 [0, \u221e]) converges to a F.I.N. diffusion.\nWe obtain the same scaling limit that was obtained in [11] for a symmetric B.T.M. Nevertheless,\nhere we have to deal with walks which are not symmetric, in contrast with the situation of [11].\nFor this purpose we express each rescaled walk as a time scale change of a Brownian motion. The\nscale change is necessary to treat the asymmetry of the walk. Then we show that the scale change\ncan be neglected. We now proceed to define a time scale change of a Brownian motion. Let \u03bc be\na locally finite discrete measure\n\u03bc(dx) :=\n\nX\n\nwi \u03b4yi (dx),\n\ni\u2208Z\n\nwhere (yi )i\u2208Z is an ordered sequence of real numbers so that yi < yj i.i.f. i < j.\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n19\n\nLet S : R \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e, \u2212\u221e} be a real valued, strictly increasing function, \u03bc will be the speedmeasure and S the scaling function of the time scale change of Brownian motion. Define the scaled\nmeasure (S \u25e6 \u03bc)(dx) as\n(S \u25e6 \u03bc)(dx) :=\nLet\n\u03c6(\u03bc, S)(t) :=\n\nZ\n\nX\n\nR\n\nwi \u03b4S(yi ) (dx).\n\ni\n\nl(t, y)(S \u25e6 \u03bc)(dy)\n\nand \u03c8(\u03bc, S)(s) be the right continuous generalized inverse of \u03c8(\u03bc, S). Then, as shown in [13]\nX(\u03bc, S)(t) := S \u22121 (X(S \u25e6 \u03bc)(t)))\nis a continuous time random walk with {yi } as its state space. The mean of the exponentially\ndistributed waiting time of X(S \u25e6 \u03bc) on yi is\n2wi\n\n(S(yi+1 ) \u2212 S(yi ))(S(yi ) \u2212 S(yi\u22121 ))\nS(yi+1 ) \u2212 S(yi\u22121 )\n\n(23)\n\nand the transition probabilities to the right and to the left respectively are\nS(yi ) \u2212 S(yi\u22121 )\nS(yi+1 ) \u2212 S(yi )\nand\n.\nS(yi+1 ) \u2212 S(yi\u22121 )\nS(yi+1 ) \u2212 S(yi\u22121 )\n\n(24)\n\nAs in the previous section, we need to define a sequence of measures (\u03bdn )n\u2208Z converging almost\nsurely vaguely to \u03c1, and which can be used to express the sequence of rescaled walks X (n,a) .\nLet\n\u03bdn :=\n\nX rn + 1\ni\u2208Z\n\n2rni\n\n\u03c4in \u03b4in\u03b1/(\u03b1+1) ,\n\nwhere \u03c4in are defined in display (22), and rn := 1 \u2212\n\n2n\u2212a\n1+n\u2212a .\n\nWe will also use a sequence of scaling\n\nn\n\nfunctions S (which will converge to the identity mapping) given by\nS n (in\u03b1/(\u03b1+1) ) :=\n\ni\u22121\nX\nj=0\n\nrj\nn\u03b1/(\u03b1+1)\n\n.\n\nWe extend the domain of definition of S n to R by linear interpolation. Then, by (23) and (24),\nwe have that X(\u03bdn , S n ) is distributed like X (n,a) . We will use the following theorem proved by\nStone in [13].\nProposition 5.1. Let (\u03bdn )n\u2208N be a sequence of measures that converges vaguely to \u03bd. Then the\ncorresponding processes (X(\u03bdn )(t), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T ) converges to (X(\u03bd)(t), 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T ) in distribution in\n(D[0, T ], J1 )\nThe proof of part (iii) of theorem 2.1 will rely in the following lemma. Let id denote the identity\nmapping on R, then we have that\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n20\n\nLemma 5.2. S n (n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) \u230an\u03b1/(\u03b1+1) *\u230b) converges uniformly on compacts to id and \u03bdn to converges\nalmost surely vaguely to \u03c1.\nProof. The convergence of the scaling functions is easily seen to be true under the assumption\na > \u03b1/(\u03b1 + 1) because\n\u230an\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) x\u230b\nn\n\nS (n\n\n\u2212\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)\n\n\u230an\n\n\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)\n\nx\u230b) =\n\nX\nj=0\n\nrnj\nn\u03b1/(\u03b1+1)\n\nand\n\u230an\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) x\u230b\n\nrn\n\n\u230an\u03b1/(\u03b1+1) x\u230b\n\nn\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)\n\n\u230an\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) x\u230b\n\n\u2264\n\nX\nj=0\n\nrnj\n\u03b1/(\u03b1+1)\nn\n\n\u2264\n\n\u230an\u03b1/(\u03b1+1) x\u230b\n.\nn\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)\n\nNow we use the fact that\n\u03b1/(1+\u03b1)\n\nrn\u230an\n\nx\u230b\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\u230an\u03b1/(1+\u03b1) x\u230b\n2n\u2212a\n1\u2212\n1 + n\u2212a\n\nconverges to 1, because a > \u03b1/(1 + \u03b1).\nIn a similar fashion it can be shown that the \"correcting factors\"\n\nrn +1\ni\n2rn\n\nin the definition of \u03bdn\n\nconverge uniformly to 1 in any bounded interval. Hence, we can show the convergence of \u03bdn to \u03c1\nas in the previous section.\n\u0003\nLemma 5.2 implies the vague convergence of (S n \u25e6 \u03bdn ) to \u03c1. Then, by proposition 5.1 we\n\ncan deduce that X(S n \u25e6 \u03bdn ) converges to X(\u03c1). Let T > 0, by lemma 5.2 we have that S \u22121\n\nalso converges uniformly to the identity. Thus, using the precedent observations, we get that\n(X(\u03bc, S)(t) : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T ) converges to (X(\u03c1)(t)0 \u2265 t \u2265 T ) in D[0, T ] with the Skorohod J \u2212 1\ntopology. We have proved that (X (n,a) (t); t \u2208 [0; T ]) converges in distribution to the F.I.N. diffusion\n\n(Z(t); t \u2208 [0, t]) on (D[0, T ], J1 ).\nThus, it remains to prove that the convergence takes place also in the uniform topology. Using\nthe fact that the support of \u03c1 is R, we can show that \u03c6(\u03c1, id) is strictly increasing. The almost sure\nvague convergence of S \u25e6 \u03bdn to \u03c1 implies that, for all t \u2265 0, \u03c6(\u03bdn , S n )(t) converges to \u03c6(\u03c1, id)(t).\n\nAs l is continuous in t, we obtain continuity of \u03c6(\u03bdn , S n ) and of \u03c6(\u03c1, id). That, plus the fact that\nthe \u03c6(\u03bdn , id) are non-decreasing implies that that \u03c6(\u03bdn , S n ) converges uniformly to \u03c6(\u03c1, id). The\n\nfunction \u03c6(\u03c1, id) is almost surely strictly increasing, because the support of \u03c1 is R. Now we can\napply corollary 13.6.4 of [14] to obtain that \u03c8(\u03bdn , S n ) converges uniformly to \u03c8(\u03c1, id). That, plus\nthe continuity of the Brownian paths yields that X(S n \u25e6 \u03bdn ) converges uniformly to X(\u03c1, id). Using\nthat S n\u22121 converges to the identity, we finally get that X(\u03bdn , S n ) converges uniformly to X(\u03c1).\n\n\fBOUCHAUD WALKS WITH VARIABLE DRIFT\n\n21\n\nReferences\n1. G.
