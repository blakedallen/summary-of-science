Introduction\nUsing quantum consistency conditions to identify interesting theories among a general\nclass of theories has proven to be a fruitful practice historically. This is epitomized by\nthe sequence of developments that initiated with the classic works by Alvarez-Gaum\u00e9 and\nWitten [1] and by Green and Schwarz [2] on anomalies, and that culminated in the discovery\nof the heterotic string by Gross, Harvey, Martinec and Rohm [3]. Gauge, gravitational\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fand mixed anomalies [1, 4] constrain the gauge symmetry of ten-dimensional supergravity\ntheories. The anomalies cannot cancel unless the gauge group is one of the groups SO(32),\nE8 \u00d7 E8 , E8 \u00d7 U (1)248 or U (1)496 [2, 5]. The SO(32) type I string theory was known at\nthe time that these constraints were discovered, but this result motivated the discovery of\nthe E8 \u00d7 E8 and Spin(32)/Z2 heterotic string theories. Recent results show that the E8 \u00d7\nU (1)248 and U (1)496 theories cannot be made simultaneously anomaly-free and consistent\nwith supersymmetry [6]. Together, these results show that the spectra of all anomaly-free\ngravity theories with minimal supersymmetry in 10D are realized in string theory.\nGravitational anomaly constraints were also used to identify the unique massless spectrum that a six-dimensional supergravity theory with N = (2, 0) symmetry can have [7].\nThis spectrum precisely agrees with the massless spectrum of type IIB string theory compactified on a K3 manifold. These results suggest that quantum consistency conditions-\nespecially anomaly constraints-are an effective tool for obtaining clues about the microscopic theory of gravity from the structure of the macroscopic theory.\nAn interesting class of theories to approach from this perspective is the set of sixdimensional N = (1, 0) supergravity theories. These theories have strong anomaly constraints, but at the same time admit diverse consistent string vacua with a wide range\nof gauge groups and matter representations. A sampling of the substantial literature on\nsix-dimensional N = (1, 0) supergravity theories and their string realizations is given in\nreferences [8]-[34]; reviews of this work and further references appear in [35], [36]. Constraints on the set of nonabelian gauge groups and matter that can appear in such theories\nwere analyzed in [32, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. We are interested here in obtaining constraints\non these theories in the case when there are abelian vector fields in the massless spectrum.\nMany six-dimensional (1, 0) supergravity theories with abelian vector fields have been\nidentified as arising from string theory vacuum constructions. Erler has analyzed the U (1)\nsector of heterotic orbifold constructions in [15] while Honecker and Trapletti have extended\nthe analysis to more general heterotic backgrounds [33]. Abelian gauge symmetry of sixdimensional F-theory backgrounds has also been studied by various authors [27, 29, 31].\nDetermining the abelian gauge symmetry of a given string model is often subtle because\nvector bosons in the spectrum that are naively massless can be lifted at the linear level by\ncoupling to St\u00fcckelberg fields. This is a generic phenomenon in many types of string models\nincluding heterotic, orbifold, intersecting brane, fractional brane and F-theory models1 .\nTherefore, a detailed analysis of all the vector-matter couplings in play is necessary in\norder to ensure that a vector boson is indeed in the massless spectrum in a given string\nmodel.\nThe anomaly cancellation structure for specific six-dimensional (1, 0) string vacua with\nabelian gauge symmetry has been worked out in the literature [15, 27, 29, 31, 33]. General\nanalyses on the full landscape of six-dimensional (1, 0) supergravity theories, however, have\nnot fully incorporated the structure of abelian gauge symmetries. In this paper we treat\nthe abelian anomaly cancellation conditions carefully and show how they place bounds on\n1\n\nWe have given an incomplete list of references that address this in the bibliography [9, 10, 15, 21, 25,\n27, 29, 31, 33, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fthe massless spectrum of general six-dimensional supergravity theories with abelian factors\nin the gauge group.\nIt was shown in [38, 40] that the number of non-abelian theories with T < 9 tensor\nmultiplets is finite. In light of this result it is natural to ask whether this bound continues\nto hold when we allow abelian gauge group factors. It is useful to divide this question into\ntwo parts. That is, we ask;\nI. Whether the number of different gauge/matter structures is finite when we ignore the\ncharges of the matter under the U (1)'s.\nII. Whether given the gauge/matter structure, the number of distinct combinations of\nU (1) charges each matter multiplet can have is finite.\nIn this paper we show that the answer to the first question is \"yes\" when T < 9. As is the\ncase with non-abelian theories, when T \u2265 9 we can generate an infinite class of theories in\nwhich the bounds that hold for T < 9 theories are violated. An example of such an infinite\nclass is given in section 3.3.\nIn addressing the second question, it is important to note that theories with multiple\nU (1) gauge symmetries (say U (1)n ) are defined up to arbitrary linear redefinitions of the\ngauge symmetry. If we assume that all the U (1)'s are compact and normalize the unit\ncharge to be 1 for each U (1) factor, the theories are defined up to SL(n, Z).\nFrom this fact, we may deduce that there are an infinite number of distinct U (1)\ncharge assignments possible for certain non-anomalous gauge/matter structures. This is\nbecause there are many known examples of theories with two U (1) factors and at least\none uncharged scalar, so that the non-anomalous gauge group can be written in the form\nU (1)2 \u00d7 G0 . Since any linear combination of the two U (1)'s is a non-anomalous U (1)\ngauge symmetry, it is possible to construct an infinite class of apparently consistent 6D\nsupergravity theories with gauge group U (1) \u00d7 G0 by simply removing the other U (1) along\nwith a neutral scalar from the spectrum.\nHence we see that the answer to the second question is negative. We may now ask,\nhowever,\nIII. Whether all infinite families of U (1)'s could be generated in the trivial manner presented above.\nIV. Whether additional quantum consistency conditions that are unknown to us at the\npresent could be employed to constrain the set of U (1) charges in a given theory.\nRegarding question III, we find that there are non-trivially generated infinite families of\nU (1) charge solutions. We have not addressed the last question here, though some speculation in this regard is included at the end of the conclusions in Section 5.\nThis paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we review the massless spectrum\nand anomaly structure of six-dimensional (1, 0) theories. In section 3 we address the first\nquestion. In section 4 we address the second and third questions. In particular, we present\nexamples of infinite classes of T = 1 theories with U (1)'s that are trivially/nontrivially\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fgenerated. We also discuss subtleties arising in the case T = 0, where there are no tensor\nmultiplets. We conclude our discussion in section 5.\nThe results in this paper are based on consistency conditions on low-energy supergravity theories, and do not depend upon a specific UV completion such as string theory. In\nsome cases, however, examples are drawn from string theory and F-theory to illuminate\nthe structure of the set of allowed models as determined from macroscopic considerations.\n\n2. 6D (1, 0) Theories and Anomaly Cancellation\nIn this section we review six-dimensional theories with N = (1, 0) supersymmetry and\nanomaly cancellation in these theories. In section 2.1 we present an overview of the field\ncontent of these theories. We compute the anomaly polynomial in section 2.2 and review\nanomaly cancellation and factorization in section 2.3. We give explicit formulae for the\nanomaly factorization condition in the presence of U (1)'s in section 2.4 and discuss some\nsalient features of these equations.\nIn sections 2.5 and 2.6 we summarize the aforementioned aspects of anomaly cancellation specializing to the cases of T = 1 and T = 0 respectively. In section 2.7 we discuss\naspects of the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism that come into play when the theory\nhas abelian gauge symmetry, and also explain why this issue can be safely ignored when\ndiscussing the massless spectrum.\n2.1 The Massless Spectrum\nThe massless spectrum of the models we consider can contain four different multiplets\nof the supersymmetry algebra: the gravity and tensor multiplet, vector multiplet, and\nhypermultiplet. The contents of these multiplets are summarized in Table 1.\nWe consider theories with one gravity multiplet. There can in general be multiple\ntensor multiplets; we denote the number of tensor multiplets by T . When T = 1 it\nis possible to write a Lagrangian for the theory; the self-dual and anti-self-dual tensors\ncan combine into a single antisymmetric tensor. Theories with T tensor multiplets have\na moduli space with SO(1, T ) symmetry; the T scalars in each multiplet combine into a\nSO(1, T ) vector j that can be taken to have unit norm. We consider theories with arbitrary\ngauge group and matter content.\nNote that a theory with a general number of tensor multiplets can still be defined despite the lack of a covariant Lagrangian. The partition function can be defined by coupling\nthe three-form field strength to a 3-form gauge potential as in [48]. Classical equations of\nmotion can be formulated as in [11, 14]. Supersymmetry and anomaly cancellation may\nbe discussed at the operator level of a theory obtained by quantizing the classical theory\ndefined by these equations.\nWe write the gauge group for a given theory as2\nG=\n2\n\n\u03bd\nY\n\n\u03ba=1\n\nG\u03ba \u00d7\n\nVA\nY\n\nU (1)i .\n\n(2.1)\n\ni=1\n\nThe gauge group generally can have a quotient by a discrete subgroup, but this does not affect the\ngauge algebra, which underlies the anomaly structure analyzed in this paper.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fMultiplet\nGravity\nTensor\nVector\nHyper\n\nField Content\n+)\n(g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c8\u03bc+ , B\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212)\n(\u03c6, \u03c7\u2212 , B\u03bc\u03bd\n(A\u03bc , \u03bb+ )\n(4\u03c6, \u03c8 \u2212 )\n\nTable 1: Six-dimensional (1,0) supersymmetry multiplets. The signs on the fermions indicate the\nchirality. The signs on antisymmetric tensors indicate self-duality/anti-self-duality.\n\nLowercase greek letters \u03ba, \u03bb, * * * are used to denote the simple non-abelian gauge group\nfactors; lowercase roman letters i, j, k, * * * are used to denote U (1) factors. \u03bd and VA\ndenote the numbers of nonabelian and abelian gauge group factors of the theory.\nWe denote by N the number of irreducible representations of the non-abelian gauge\ngroup under which the matter hypermultiplets transform (including trivial representations);\nwe use uppercase roman letters to index these representations. We say that hypermultiplets\ntransform in the representation R\u03baI under G\u03ba and have U (1)i charge qI,i .\nWe characterize theories by their massless spectrum. There is a slight subtlety we\nmust consider when dealing with U (1) gauge symmetries. It is possible to break U (1)\nat the linearized level by certain hypermultiplets, called \"linear hypermultiplets\" in the\nliterature [49]. We will refer to these multiplets simply as \"linear multiplets\" throughout\nthis paper. When a linear multiplet couples to a vector multiplet the two merge into a\nlong (or non-BPS) multiplet and are lifted from the massless spectrum. Once lifted from\nthe massless spectrum, these long multiplets can be safely ignored. This issue is discussed\nin more detail in section 2.7.\n\n2.2 The Anomaly Polynomial for Theories with U (1)'s\n\nIn six-dimensional chiral theories there can be gravitational, gauge and mixed anomalies\n[4]. The sign with which each chiral field contributes to the anomaly is determined by their\nchirality.\nThe 6D anomaly can be described by the method of descent from an 8D anomaly\npolynomial. The anomaly polynomial is obtained by adding up the contributions of all the\nchiral fields present in the theory [1]. For the T = 1 case this is given in [15, 33].

VN A is\nthe number of non-abelian vector multiplets in the theory. The integer N , which is the\nnumber of irreducible representations of the non-abelian gauge group, plays an important\nrole in bounding the number of U (1)'s. We use 'tr' to denote the trace in the fundamental\nrepresentation, and 'Tr' to denote the trace in the adjoint. Multiplication of forms should\nbe interpreted as wedge products throughout this paper unless stated otherwise.\n2.3 Anomaly Cancellation and Factorization\nThe Green-Schwarz mechanism [2] can be generalized to theories with more than one tensor\nmultiplet when the anomaly polynomial is factorizes in the following form [14, 26]:\nI8 = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03a9\u03b1\u03b2 X4\u03b1 X4\u03b2 ,\n32\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n(2.6)\n\n\fwhere \u03a9 is a symmetric bilinear form (or metric) in SO(1, T ) and X4 is a four form that\nis an SO(1, T ) vector. X4 can be written as\nX 2b\u03b1\nX\n1\nX4\u03b1 = a\u03b1 trR2 +\n( \u03ba )trF\u03ba2 +\n2b\u03b1ij Fi Fj ,\n2\n\u03bb\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\n(2.7)\n\nij\n\nwhere we define bij to be symmetric in i, j. The a and b's are SO(1, T ) vectors and \u03b1 are\nSO(1, T ) indices. Note that the anomaly coefficients for the U (1)'s can be written in this\nway due to the fact that the field strength is gauge invariant on its own [30]. The \u03bb\u03ba 's are\nnormalization factors that are fixed by demanding that the smallest topological charge of\nan embedded SU(2) instanton is 1. These factors, which are equal to the Dynkin indices of\nthe fundamental representation of each gauge group, are listed in table 2 for all the simple\ngroups. The b\u03ba 's form an integral SO(1, T ) lattice when we include these normalization\nfactors [40].\nThe gauge-invariant three-form field strengths are given by\nX b\u03b1\nX\n1\nij\n\u03ba \u03ba\n\u03c93Y + 2\nb\u03b1ij \u03c93Y\n,\nH \u03b1 = dB \u03b1 + a\u03b1 \u03c93L + 2\n2\n\u03bb\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\n(2.8)\n\nij\n\nwhere \u03c93L and \u03c93Y are Chern-Simons 3-forms of the spin connection and gauge fields\nrespectively. If the factorization condition (2.6) is satisfied, anomaly cancellation can be\nachieved by adding the local counterterm\n\u03b4LGS \u221d \u2212\u03a9\u03b1\u03b2 B \u03b1 \u2227 X4\u03b2 .\n\n(2.9)\n\nMeanwhile, supersymmetry determines the kinetic term for the gauge fields to be (up\nto an overall factor) [14, 30]\n\u2212\n\nX\nX j * b\u03ba\n)tr(F\u03ba \u2227 \u2217F\u03ba ) \u2212\n(j * bij )(Fi \u2227 \u2217Fj ) ,\n(\n\u03bb\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\n(2.10)\n\nij\n\nwhere j is the unit SO(1, T ) vector that parametrizes the T scalars in the tensor multiplets.\nThe inner product of j and the b vectors are defined with respect to the metric \u03a9. There\nmust be a value of j such that all the gauge fields have positive definite kinetic terms. This\nmeans that there should be some value of j such that all j * b\u03ba are positive and such that\nj * bij is a positive definite matrix with respect to i, j.\nIf we did not have any U (1)'s, (2.6) would be the only way in which the anomaly can\nbe cancelled. When we have abelian vector multiplets, however, a generalized version of\nthe Green-Schwarz mechanism is available [25]. In this case, it is possible to cancel terms\nin the 8-form anomaly polynomial that are proportional to\nF \u2227 X6 ,\n\n\u03bb\n\nAn\n1\n\nBn\n2\n\nCn\n1\n\nDn\n2\n\nE6\n6\n\n(2.11)\nE7\n12\n\nE8\n60\n\nF4\n6\n\nG2\n2\n\nTable 2: Normalization factors for the simple groups.\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fwhere X6 is a six form, by a counter-term in the action of the form\n\u2212C \u2227 X6 ,\n\n(2.12)\n\nwhere C is a St\u00fcckelberg 0-form that belongs to a linear multiplet. The coupling of C to\nthe vector boson V is given by\n1\n(\u2202\u03bc C \u2212 V\u03bc )2 ,\n(2.13)\n2\nwhich is what we mean by C being a St\u00fcckelberg 0-form. The anomalous gauge boson V\nrecieves a mass, hence rendering the U (1) broken; the abelian vector multiplet is lifted from\nthe massless spectrum by coupling to the linear multiplet by the St\u00fcckelberg mechanism.\nWhen all the anomalous U (1)'s are lifted and we look at the pure massless spectrum of\nthe theory, all the gravitational anomalies and gauge/mixed anomalies induced by the\nmassless fields are cancelled completely by two forms through the conventional GreenSchwarz mechanism. The lesson is that when we are discussing the massless spectrum, this\ngeneralized version of the Green-Schwarz mechanism does not come into play and can be\nsafely ignored.3 We elaborate further on this issue in section 2.7.\n2.4 The Factorization Equations\nWe are now ready to write down the factorization equations in the presence of U (1)'s. The\nfactorization equations come from demanding that the anomaly polynomial (2.2) factorize\nin the form (2.6). Comparing the terms with no abelian field strength factors gives the\nconditions\nR4 :\n(R2 )2 :\nF 2 R2 :\nF4 :\n\n273 = H \u2212 V + 29T\n\na*a =9\u2212T\nX\n1\na * b\u03ba = \u03bb\u03ba (AAdj\u03ba \u2212\nM\u03baI AI\u03ba )\n6\nI\nX\n0 = BAdj\u03ba \u2212\nM\u03baI B\u03baI\n\n(2.14)\n(2.15)\n(2.16)\n(2.17)\n\nI\n\n(F 2 )2 :\nF\u03ba2 F\u03bc2 :\n\nX\n1\nb\u03ba * b\u03ba = \u03bb2\u03ba (\nM\u03baI C\u03baI \u2212 CAdj\u03ba )\n3\nI\nX \u03ba\u03bc\nMI AI\u03ba AI\u03bc\nb\u03ba * b\u03bc = \u03bb\u03ba \u03bb\u03bc\n\n(2.18)\n(2.19)\n\nI\n\nThe inner products on the left-hand-side of the equations are taken with respect to the\nSO(1, T ) metric \u03a9. For each representation R of a given group, the group theory coefficients\nAR , BR , CR are defined by\ntrR F 2 = AR trF 2 ,\n\ntrR F 4 = BR trF 4 + CR (trF 2 )2 ,\n\n3\n\n(2.20)\n\nThe situation is quite the opposite when we are taking the top-down approach, for example when we are\nconstructing theories from string compactifications. Since we are working downward from the high-energy\nend, it is then important to figure out which U (1) vector bosons that naively seem to be massless are lifted\nby this mechanism.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fwhere tr denotes the trace with respect to the fundamental representation. For each hypermultiplet I we use the shorthand notation\nAI\u03ba = ARI\u03ba ,\n\nB\u03baI = BRI\u03ba ,\n\nC\u03baI = CRI\u03ba .\n\n(2.21)\n\nWe refer to the first anomaly equation (2.14) as the gravitational anomaly constraint.\nThe U (1) anomaly equations obtained by comparing terms with abelian field strength\nfactors are given by\n1X\nMI qI,i qI,j\n6\nI\nX\n0=\nM\u03baI E\u03baI qI,i\n\nFi Fj R2 :\n\na * bij = \u2212\n\nFi3 F\u03ba :\n\n(2.22)\n(2.23)\n\nI\n\nFi Fj F\u03ba2 :\nFi Fj Fk Fl :\n\nX\nb\u03ba\n( ) * bij =\nM\u03baI AI\u03ba qI,i qI,j\n\u03bb\u03ba\nI\nX\nbij * bkl + bik * bjl + bil * bjk =\nMI qI,i qI,j qI,k qI,l\n\n(2.24)\n(2.25)\n\nI\n\nfor all i, j, k, l. The group theory coefficient E is defined to be\ntrR F 3 = ER trF 3\n\n(2.26)\n\nand E\u03baI = ERI\u03ba .\nIt is useful to summarize these anomaly constraints by the following polynomial identities;\n1X\nMI fI (xi )2\n6\nI\nX\n0=\nM\u03baI E\u03baI fI (xi )\n\na * P (xi ) = \u2212\n\n(2.27)\n(2.28)\n\nI\n\nb\u03ba * P (xi ) = \u03bb\u03ba\n\nX\nI\n\nM\u03baI AI\u03ba fI (xi )2\n\n1X\nMI fI (xi )4\nP (xi ) * P (xi ) =\n3\n\n(2.29)\n(2.30)\n\nI\n\nHere we have defined the SO(1, T ) scalar and vector polynomials\nX\nfI (xi ) \u2261\nqI,i xi\n\n(2.31)\n\ni\n\nP \u03b1 (xi ) \u2261\n\nX\n\nb\u03b1ij xi xj .\n\n(2.32)\n\ni\n\nThe reason that U (1) factorization conditions can be written as polynomial identities is\nbecause the field strengths of the U (1)'s behave like numbers rather than matrices in the\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fanomaly polynomial. We note that the xi are auxiliary variables and do not have any\nphysical significance.\nA theory with charges qI,i assigned to the hypermultiplets is only consistent if there\nexist bij satisfying these equations that give a positive-definite kinetic matrix j * bij for\nthe U (1) gauge fields. It is useful to define the charge vector with respect to U (1)i whose\ncomponents are the charges of the N nonabelian representations:\nqi \u2261 (q1,i , q2,i , * * * , qN,i )\n~\n\n(2.33)\n\nThere is a GL(VA , R) symmetry of the U (1) anomaly equations that originates from\nthe fact that there is a freedom of redefining U (1)'s. If there are multiple U (1)'s one could\ntake some new linear combination of them to define a new set of non-anomalous U (1)'s.\nThe equations are invariant under\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nq~1\nq~1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec q~2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec q~ \uf8f7\n\u0001\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7 \u2192 M \uf8ec .2 \uf8f7 , (b\u03b1 )ij \u2192 M t (b\u03b1 )M ,\n(2.34)\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\nij\n\uf8ed . \uf8f8\n\uf8ed . \uf8f8\nq~VA\nq~VA\n\nfor M \u2208 GL(VA , R). We have denoted (b\u03b1 ) to be the matrix whose (i, j) element is\nb\u03b1ij . When we are discussing properly quantized charges of compact U (1)'s the linear\nredefinitions of the U (1)'s must be given by elements of SL(VA , Z) \u2282 GL(VA , R). Here,\nhowever, we merely use the fact that the anomaly equations are invariant under GL(VA , R)\nas a tool for obtaining bounds on the number of U (1)'s we can add to a given theory.\nTherefore, we do not need to be concerned with the issue of integrality of charges.\nThe factorization equations, combined with the positive-definite condition on bij , impose stronger constraints on the theory when T < 9. This is because a is timelike when\nT < 9:\na*a=9\u2212T >0\n\n(2.35)\n\nWhen a is timelike,\na * y = 0, y * y \u2265 0\n\n\u21d2\n\ny=0\n\n(2.36)\n\nfor any arbitrary SO(1, T ) vector y. This fact is used in [40] to bound the number of theories\nwith nonabelian gauge groups, and is also crucial in bounding the space of theories with\nabelian factors. In particular, this fact implies that the charge vectors ~qi must be linearly\nindependent in order to get a positive definite kinetic term for the U (1)'s when T < 9. If\nthey are not, there exists non-zero (xi ) such that fI (xi ) = 0 for all I since\nf~(xi ) \u2261 (f1 (xi ), * * * , fN (xi )) =\n\nX\n\nxi ~qi .\n\n(2.37)\n\ni\n\nFor such xi , we see that\na * P (xi ) = 0,\n\nP (xi ) * P (xi ) = 0 .\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n(2.38)\n\n\fThis implies that P (xi ) = 0, which in turn implies that j * P (xi ) = 0, i.e.,\nX\n(j * b)ij xi xj = 0 .\n\n(2.39)\n\nij\n\nThis would mean that the kinetic term is not positive-definite. Hence we have proven that in\norder for the kinetic term to be positive-definite, ~qi must be linearly independent when T <\n9. This in particular means that we cannot have a massless U (1) vector under which nothing\nis charged, i.e., that when T < 9, the trivial solutions to the U (1) factorization equations\nwhere all the charges are set to qI,i = 0 are not acceptable. The analogous connection\nin 10D between U (1) charges and the BF 2 term, which is related by supersymmetry to\nthe gauge kinetic term [14], also played a key role in the analysis in [6] showing that\nthe ten-dimensional supergravity theories with gauge group U (1)496 and E8 \u00d7 U (1)248 are\ninconsistent.\nThe fact that ~\nqi are all linearly independent for T < 9 also implies that\nX\nP (xi ) * P (xi ) =\nMI fI (xi )4 > 0\n(2.40)\nI\n\nfor all non-zero xi as fI (xi ) cannot be made simultaneously zero for all I. We make use of\n(2.40) in bounding the set of abelian theories in section 3.\n2.5 T = 1\nIn this section we discuss anomaly cancellation and the factorization equations in the special\ncase of one tensor multiplet. As discussed earlier, these theories have a Lagrangian description, unlike theories with other T values. T = 1 string models are the most thoroughly\nstudied string vacua in the six-dimensional string landscape. The most widely studied\nstring constructions that give T = 1 vacua are K3 manifold/orbifold compactifications of\nthe heterotic string [9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 33], and Calabi-Yau threefold compactifications of F-theory [21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. These were intensively\ninvestigated as they played an essential role in understanding various string dualities.\nThe basis most commonly used for T = 1 theories in the literature is\n!\n!\n!\n!\n1\n1\ne\u03c6\n\u03b1\u03ba\n01\n\u22122\n(2.41)\n,\nj=\u221a\n\u03a9=\n,\na=\n,\nb = \u03bb\u03ba\n2\n\u03b1\u0303\u03ba\n10\n\u22122\n2 e\u2212\u03c6\nfor which the factorization condition becomes\nX\nX\nX\nX\n1\nI8 = \u2212 (trR2 \u2212\n\u03b1\u03ba trF\u03ba2 \u2212\n\u03b1ij Fi Fj ) \u2227 (trR2 \u2212\n\u03b1\u0303\u03ba trF\u03ba2 \u2212\n\u03b1\u0303ij Fi Fj ) .

Also, in order for the distinct U (1)i vector\nmultiplets to be independent degrees of freedom, \u03b3ij must be non-degenerate.\nIn order to discuss the factorization equations coming from terms with abelian gauge\nfield factors, in addition to fI (xi ) = qI,i xi it is convenient to define the quadratic forms\nX\nX\nF (xi ) =\n\u03b1ij xi xj\nF\u0303 (xi ) =\n\u03b1\u0303ij xi xj .\n(2.52)\nij\n\nij\n\nThese are the components of P \u03b1 (x) defined through (2.32).\nThe factorization condition can then be summarized by the polynomial identities\nX\n0=\n(M\u03baI E\u03baI )fI (xi )\nfor all \u03ba\n(2.53)\nI\n\n1X\nMI fI (xi )2\nF (xi ) + F\u0303 (xi ) =\n6\nI\nX\n\u03b1\u0303\u03ba F (xi ) + \u03b1\u03ba F\u0303 (xi ) = 4\n(M\u03baI AI\u03ba )fI (xi )2\n\n(2.54)\nfor all \u03ba\n\n(2.55)\n\nI\n\nF (xi )F\u0303 (xi ) =\n\n2X\nMI fI (xi )4\n3\nI\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(2.56)\n\n\fThe basis chosen for the U (1) factors is defined up to GL(VA , R):\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nq~1\nq~1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec q~2 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec q~ \uf8f7\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7 \u2192 M \uf8ec .2 \uf8f7 , (\u03b1)ij \u2192 M t (\u03b1)M , (\u03b1\u0303)ij \u2192 M t (\u03b1\u0303)M\n.\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\n\uf8ec . \uf8f7\nij\nij\n\uf8ed . \uf8f8\n\uf8ed . \uf8f8\nq~VA\nq~VA\n\n(2.57)\n\n(\u03b1) and (\u03b1\u0303) denote the matrices whose (i, j) element is \u03b1ij and \u03b1\u0303ij , respectively.\nAs proven in the last section, since T = 1 < 9, the charge vectors {~qi } are linearly\nindependent for solutions of the factorization equations that give a non-degenerate kinetic\nterm for some value of the dilaton. Linear independence of ~qi imposes positive-definiteness\non both \u03b1ij and \u03b1\u0303ij . The reason is that the r.h.s.'s of (2.54) and (2.56) are both positive\nfor any real xi if ~\nqi are linearly independent. This is because f~(xi ) cannot be zero for any\nreal xi . Hence F (xi ) and F\u0303 (xi ) are positive for all real xi . Therefore, \u03b1ij and \u03b1\u0303ij both\nhave to be positive definite.\nWe now work out two explicit examples where we can see the equations at play. The\nfirst example is given by orbifold compactifications of the E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic string theory\n[15]. This theory has gauge group E7 \u00d7 E8 \u00d7 U (1) with 10 56's and 66 singlets with respect\nto E7 . Nothing is charged under the E8 . This matter structure solves the non-abelian\nfactorization equations. The non-abelian part of the anomaly polynomial factorizes to\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(trR2 \u2212 trFE2 7 \u2212 trFE2 8 ) \u2227 (trR2 \u2212 trFE2 7 + trFE2 8 ) .\n(2.58)\n16\n6\n30\n5\nWe index the hypermultiplet representations 56 by I = 1, * * * , 10 and the singlets by\nI = 11, * * * , 76. Since there is only one U (1), there is only a single \u03b1 = \u03b111 and a single\n\u03b1\u0303 = \u03b1\u030311 . Also, fI (x) = qI x.\nTherefore, the anomaly equations can be obtained by plugging in\n\u2212\n\nF (x) = \u03b1x,\n\nF\u0303 (x) = \u03b1\u0303x,\n\nfI (x) = qI x\n\n(2.59)\n\nto equations (2.53)-(2.56). Since E7 and E8 do not have third order invariants, and no\nmatter is charged under E8 , we obtain\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03b1 + \u03b1\u0303 = 0\n5\n30\n\n(2.60)\n\n76\n10\nX\nX\n1\nqI2 )\n\u03b1 + \u03b1\u0303 = (56\nqI2 +\n6\nI=1\n\n(2.61)\n\nI=11\n\n10\n\nX\n1\nqI2\n\u03b1 + \u03b1\u0303 = 4\n6\n\n(2.62)\n\nI=1\n\n76\n10\nX\nX\n2\nqI4 )\nqI4 +\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0303 = (56\n3\nI=1\n\nThis can be re-written as\n56\n\n10\nX\nI=1\n\nqI4\n\n+\n\n76\nX\n\nI=11\n\nqI4\n\n= 36\n\n10\nX\n\nqI2\n\nI=1\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n!2\n\n(2.63)\n\nI=11\n\n9\n=\n196\n\n76\nX\n\nI=11\n\nqI2\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(2.64)\n\n\fFive distinct charge assignments that give solutions to these equations can be obtained by\ndifferent abelian orbifold-by which we mean an orbifold whose orbifold group is abelian-\ncompactifications. For example, there is a Z8 orbifold compactification that assigns the\ncharges\nq1 = q2 = \u22123/8,\n\nq3 = q4 = q5 = \u22121/4,\n\nq11 = * * * = q30 = 1/8,\n\nq45 = * * * = q50 = \u22123/4,\n\nq8 = q9 = q10 = 0,\n\nq31 = * * * = q34 = \u22127/8,\n\nq51 = * * * = q54 = 3/8,\n\nq59 = * * * = q77 = 1/2,\n\nq6 = q7 = \u22121/8,\n\nq35 = q44 = 1/4,\n\nq55 = * * * = q58 = \u22125/8,\n\nq78 = * * * = q66 = \u22121/2\n\nto the hypermultiplets. The anomaly coefficients for these charge assignments are\n\u03b1 = 1,\n\n\u03b1\u0303 = 6.\n\n(2.65)\n\nAll five solutions from abelian orbifolds are given in table 1 of [15].\nWe present one more example that will prove to be useful later in this paper. Consider\nthe gauge group SU (13) \u00d7 U (1) with 4 two-index anti-symmetric, 6 fundamental and 23\nsinglet representations of SU (13). These solve the anomaly equations that do not concern\nthe U (1) field strengths. The non-abelian part factorizes to\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n2\n2\n(trR2 \u2212 2trFSU\n(13) ) \u2227 (trR \u2212 2trFSU (13) ) .\n16\n\n(2.66)\n\nDenoting the charges of hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric/fundamental/singlet representations as ax (x = 1, * * * , 4)/fy (y = 1, * * * , 6)/sz (z = 1, * * * , 23) the anomaly equations\nbecome\n0=\n\nX\n\n9ax +\n\nx\n\nX\n\nfy\n\n(2.67)\n\ny\n\nX\nX\n1 X\n78a2x +\n13fy2 +\ns2z )\n\u03b1 + \u03b1\u0303 = (\n6 x\ny\nz\nX\nX\n2\n2\n2\u03b1 + 2\u03b1\u0303 = 4(\n11ax +\nfy )\nx\n\n(2.68)\n(2.69)\n\ny\n\nX\nX\n2 X\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0303 = (\n78a4x +\n13fy4 +\ns4z )\n3 x\ny\nz\n\n(2.70)\n\nIf there exist for given ax , fy , sz a solution \u03b1, \u03b1\u0303 to these equations, the anomaly polynomial\nfactorizes into\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(trR2 \u2212 2trFSU\n(13) \u2212 \u03b1FU (1) ) \u2227 (trR \u2212 2trFSU (13) \u2212 \u03b1\u0303FU (1) )\n16\n\n(2.71)\n\nWe identify infinite classes of charge assignments and \u03b1, \u03b1\u0303 values that solve these equations\nin section 4.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f2.6 T = 0\nWe now discuss anomaly cancellation and the factorization equations in the case of T = 0.\nTheories without tensor multiplets are in some ways the simplest type of 6D supergravity\ntheory. Although such vacua do not arise directly from geometric heterotic or type II\ncompactifications, T = 0 vacua are easily constructed in F-theory by compactifications\non the base P2 , and can be reached from T = 1 vacua by tensionless string transitions\n[21, 22]. F-theory models for T = 0 vacua based on toric Calabi-Yau threefolds that are\nelliptic fibrations over P2 have recently been systematically studied in [50]. Analysis of 6D\nsupergravity theories with T = 0 are given in [42], and F-theory vacua giving T = 0 vacua\nare systematically studied in [34]. Further references for string constructions of T = 0\nvacua can be found in these papers.\nIn the case T = 0 all the SO(1, T ) vectors a, b, j reduce to numbers. j 2 = 1 leaves us\nwith a sign ambiguity. Without loss of generality we can set j = 1. Positivity of the kinetic\nterm imposes that the b\u03ba 's be positive and that bij be a positive definite matrix. This and\nequation (2.27) sets a < 0. The relation a2 = 9 \u2212 T fixes a = \u22123. To summarize,\n\u03a9 = 1,\n\na = \u22123,\n\nj = 1.\n\n(2.72)\n\nIn this case the factorization condition becomes\nI8 = \u2212\n\nX 2b\u03ba\nX\n1\n3\n(\u2212 trR2 +\ntrF\u03ba2 +\n2bij Fi Fj )2 .\n32 2\n\u03bb\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\n(2.73)\n\nij\n\nThe gravitational anomaly constraint becomes\nH \u2212 V = 273 .\n\n(2.74)\n\nThe factorization equations coming from U (1)'s can be written out by using the\nquadratic form\nX\nP (xi ) =\nbij xi xj ,\n(2.75)\nij\n\nas the polynomial identities\n0=\n\nX\n(M\u03baI E\u03baI )fI (xi )\n\nfor all \u03ba\n\n(2.76)\n\nI\n\n1 X\nMI fI (xi )2\nP (xi ) =\n18\nI\n\u03bb\u03ba X\nP (xi ) =\n(M\u03baI AI\u03ba )fI (xi )2\nb\u03ba\nI\nX\n1\nMI fI (xi )4\nP (xi )2 =\n3\n\n(2.77)\nfor all \u03ba\n\n(2.78)\n(2.79)\n\nI\n\nThe basis chosen for the U (1) factors is as usual defined up to GL(VA , R) through\n(2.34).

We first consider a theory with gauge group SU (6) \u00d7 U (1)\nwith 1 adjoint, 9 two-index anti-symmetric, 18 fundamental and 31 singlet representations\nof SU (6). These solve the non-abelian anomaly factorization equations.

If we assume that the U (1) is compact and the charges are integers then this is a\nsystem of Diophantine equations over the integers. In general, classifying solutions to such\na system of equations can be a highly nontrivial problem in number theory.\nA particularly interesting class of examples are pure abelian theories. In this case\nthe only non-trivial abelian anomaly equations are equations (2.22) and (2.25) ((2.81) and\n(2.84) for T = 0). For a theory with a given number of abelian vector multiplets, there\nis a lower bound on the number of charged multiplets it must have. When the number of\ncharged hypermultiplets saturate this bound, the charges that the hypermultiplets carry is\nseverely restricted. Such theories have a particularly simple structure and are interesting\nto study further.\nAs an example, consider the case of a purely abelian theory when T = 0 and VA = 1.\nWe denote the charges of the X charged hypermultiplets in the theory by q1 , * * * , qX 6= 0.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fThen we must solve\n18b =\n\nX\n\nqI2 ,\n\nI\n\n2\n\n3b =\n\nX\n\n(2.86)\n\nqI4 .\n\nI\n\nUsing the inequality\nX\nX\n(\nqI2 )2 \u2264 X(\nqI4 ),\n\n(2.87)\n\nX \u2265 108.\n\n(2.88)\n\nI\n\nI\n\nwe see that\n\nWhen X is equal to 108, i.e., when the number of charged hypermultiplets saturates the\nlower bound, the only solutions to the equations (2.86) are\nqI = \u00b1Q\n\nfor all I,\n\nb = 6Q2 .\n\n(2.89)\n\nSimilarly for any pure abelian T = 0 theory, using (2.76) and (2.79) we can show that\nthe following relation between VA and the number of charged hypermultiplets X holds\n324 VA\n\u2264 X \u2264 VA + 273.\nVA + 2\n\n(2.90)\n\nThe proof is given in appendix B. Hence, as above, when VA = 1 there must be at least\n108 charged hypermultiplets; likewise, when VA = 2 there must be at least 162 charged\nhypermultiplets. As seen in the VA = 1 case, in the marginal cases when X exactly\nsaturates this bound, the solutions to the charge equations are particularly simple. From\n(2.90) it follows that the maximum possible number of U (1) factors that can be included\nin any T = 0 theory with no nonabelian gauge group is VA \u2264 17.4\nA family of marginal/nearly marginal T = 0 theories with gauge group U (1)k , k \u2264 7\ncan be obtained by Higgsing an SU (8) theory with one adjoint hypermultiplet and nine\nantisymmetric hypermultiplets. The number of charged hypermultiplets X for the various\npure abelian theories one obtains by Higgsing the adjoint of this theory in different ways\nis summarized in table 3. An F-theory construction of this SU (8) model, which has b = 3,\nthrough an explicit Weierstrass model is described in [34]. In principle the adjoint in\nthis construction can be Higgsed to give an F-theory description of the full family of\nmarginal/near marginal U (1)k models, though we have not worked out the details of this\nHiggsing.\nExplicit F-theory compactifications are known for the first four theories on this table.\nSix-dimensional N = (1, 0) theories with T = 0 can be obtained by F-theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds that are elliptic fibrations of P2 [21]. Such a Calabi-Yau\n4\n\n(2.90) alone implies that VA \u2264 17 or VA \u2265 32. An additional constraint following from equations (2.76)\nand (2.79) is needed to obtain the desired bound. We derive this constraint and show that indeed VA \u2264 17\nin appendix B.\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fGauge Group\nX\n324 VA /(VA + 2)\nX\u2032\n\n*\n0\n0\n273\n\nU (1)\n108\n108\n166\n\nU (1)2\n162\n162\n113\n\nU (1)3\n198\n194.4...\n78\n\nU (1)4\n225\n216\n52\n\nU (1)5\n243\n231.4...\n35\n\nU (1)6\n252\n243\n27\n\nU (1)7\n252\n252\n28\n\nTable 3: The number of charged hypermultiplets X for pure abelian theories obtained by Higgsing\nthe adjoint of the SU (8) theory with one adjoint and nine antisymmetrics. We have also tabulated\nthe number of uncharged hypermultiplets in the theory, X \u2032 = (273 + VA \u2212 X).\n\nthreefold that is non-singular can be expressed as a degree 18 hypersurface in the projective\nspace P[1, 1, 1, 6, 9] [51], which is denoted by\nX18 [1, 1, 1, 6, 9]2,272 .\n\n(2.91)\n\nThe subscript denotes the degree of the hypersurface, the number in the brackets parametrize\nthe projective space, and the two superscripts denote the h1,1 and h2,1 values of the manifold. For T = 0 vacua, the total rank of the gauge group is given by (h1,1 \u2212 2) and the\nnumber of uncharged hypermultiplet is given by (h2,1 + 1) [21]. It is easy to check that the\ndata of this manifold reproduces the first theory in table 3.\nThere is a general process by which one can replace the fiber-type of an elliptically\nfibered manifold to generate a different manifold [51]. From the point of view of stringy\ngeometry, one can understand this as a conifold transition between topologically distinct\nmanifolds [52]. Three manifolds can be generated from X18 [1, 1, 1, 6, 9]2,272 by successive\nconifold transitions. They are given by\nX12 [1, 1, 1, 3, 6]3,165 ,\n\nX9 [1, 1, 1, 3, 3]4,112 ,\n\nX6,6 [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3]5,77 .\n\n(2.92)\n\nAt a generic point in the complex moduli space, theories obtained by compactifying on these\nmanifolds do not have nonabelian gauge symmetry. Comparing the numbers with table 3,\nwe find that the massless spectrum of the six-dimensional theories obtained by F-theory\ncompactifications on the three manifolds of (2.92) coincides with the massless spectrum of\nthe second, third and fourth theories of table 3 with gauge groups U (1)k , k = 1, 2, 3. We do\nnot know how to continue this process to construct an explicit geometry realizing a theory\nwith gauge group U (1)4 .\n2.7 Linear Multiplets and Generalized Green-Schwarz Anomaly Cancellation\nIn this section we discuss linear multiplets and their role in the generalized Green-Schwarz\nanomaly cancellation mechanism. We first discuss how two different types of hypermultiplets can be distinguished when we consider their representation under SU (2)R . Then\nwe show how each multiplet couples to vector multiplets. In particular, we show how a\nlinear multiplet can couple to an abelian vector multiplet and form a long multiplet. Next\nwe depict the role that linear multiplets play in the generalized Green-Schwarz anomaly\ncancellation mechanism. Lastly we show that we may ignore long multiplets formed in this\nway and the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism when we are discussing the massless\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\fspectrum of the theory. Most of the information on linear multiplets given in this section\ncan be found in [53].\nThere are two different kinds of hypermultiplets in supersymmetric 6D theories with\n8 supercharges. The scalar components of the hypermultiplet can transform either as a\ncomplex 2 or a real 3 + 1 under the SU (2)R symmetry of the theory. We refer to the first\ntype of hypermultiplet simply as hypermultiplets, and the second kind of hypermultiplet as\nlinear multiplets. As far as their contribution to the gravitational anomaly are concerned,\nthe two kinds of hypermultiplets behave identically. The fermions of the linear multiplet\nare not charged under any gauge group, so the contribution of the linear multiplet to the\nanomaly is equivalent to that of a neutral hypermultiplet, as shown shortly.\nAs stated above, under the SU (2)R symmetry, the scalar components of the hypermultiplet transform as a complex 2. The spinors, on the other hand are neutral, i.e., singlets\n(1). Meanwhile, the scalar components of the linear multiplet transform as a real 3 + 1.\nThe spinors transform as 2's.\nTo see how these multiplets couple to other fields, it is useful to reduce to four dimensions on a two-torus and write out the Lagrangian in terms of N = 1 superfields.\nBoth multiplets, when dimensionally reduced, are N = 2 fields that consist of two chiral\nsuperfields. The hypermultiplets can transform in a non-trivial representation of the gauge\ngroup and consist of two chiral superfields Q and Q\u0303. In this case, the representation of\nQ must be the conjugate of that of Q\u0303. It is well known that this multiplet couples to the\nN = 2 vector multiplet that consists of a vector multiplet V and a chiral multiplet \u03a6 in\nthe adjoint representation as\nZ\nZ\n4\n4\n\u2020 V\n\u2020 \u2212V\nd xd \u03b8 (Q e Q + Q\u0303 e Q\u0303) + d4 xd2 \u03b8 Q\u0303T \u03a6Q + (h.c.) .\n(2.93)\nMeanwhile, the linear multiplets couple to other fields in quite a different manner [53].\nThey cannot couple to gauge fields in the standard way, as the Lagrangian would not be\nSU (2)R invariant in this case. They can couple to U (1) gauge fields, however. The linear\nmultiplet consists of two chiral fields C and B and couples to U (1) gauge fields as\nZ\nZ\n1\n1\n\u2020\n2\n\u2020\n4\n4\nd4 xd2 \u03b8 B\u03a6 + (h.c.) .\n(2.94)\nd xd \u03b8 ( (iC \u2212 iC \u2212 V ) + B B) \u2212 \u221a\n2\n2\nWriting the scalar of C as (\u03c03 + i\u03c6) and the scalar of B as (\u03c01 + i\u03c02 ), the kinetic terms for\nthe scalars become\nZ\n1\n(2.95)\n\u2212 d4 x((\u2202\u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 A\u03bc )2 + (\u2202\u03bc \u03c0i )2 ) .\n2\nThe \u03c6 can be gauged away using the gauge transformation\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + \u2202\u03bc \u039b,\n\n1\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + \u039b,\n2\n\n(2.96)\n\nand the U (1) gauge field obtains mass 1/2. The U (1) gauge field has recived a mass by\nthe St\u00fcckelberg mechanism.\nBy integrating out the F-terms of the linear multiplet, we see that the scalar in \u03a6\nrecieves the same mass(1/2). Meanwhile, the fermions do not couple to the gauge field,\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fand hence only contribute to gravitational anomalies. They only couple to the fermions in\nV and \u03a6 through Dirac mass terms, i.e., fermions of C and B pair up with fermions of V\nand \u03a6 into two Dirac fermions of mass 1/2.\nCombining the auxiliary fields of V and \u03a6, we get three real auxiliary fields (the 'D\nfields' for the N = 2 vector multiplet) that are in the 3 of SU (2)R . These couple to the\nscalars transforming as the 3:\nZ\n\u2212\n\nd4 x(\u03c0i D i )\n\n(2.97)\n\nExpanding around a vacuum with \u03c0i = 0, the U (1) vector multiplet and linear multiplet\ntogether form a long N = 2 multiplet with 5 scalars, 2 Dirac fermions, and a vector field,\nall of mass 1/2 in units of the mass parameter. Note that this long massive spin-1 multiplet\nis not chiral, as the fermions are Dirac.\nWhen we have linear multiplets, they may be used to cancel anomalies. As discussed\nin section 2.3, it is possible to cancel anomalies of the form\nFi \u2227 X6 ,\n\n(2.98)\n\nwhere X6 is a six form, by adding the term\n\u2212\u03c6 \u2227 X6 .\n\n(2.99)\n\n\u03c6 is a St\u00fcckelberg 0-form inside a linear multiplet.\nIn order for the generalized anomaly cancellation to work, we must have a linear\nmultiplet at our disposal. If we do not have such a linear multiplet, we cannot get rid of\nthe term and hence the theory would be anomalous. In case we have such a multiplet,\nthrough the St\u00fcckelberg mechanism, we expect the linear multiplet to be eaten to form a\nlong massive spin-1 multiplet. Schematically, we may write\nL i = Vi + H i ,\n\n(2.100)\n\nwhere Li denotes the long multiplet, Vi denotes the U (1) vector multiplet, and Hi the\nlinear multiplet.\nSo we see that all the vector bosons of U (1) gauge symmetries whose anomalies are\ncancelled in this fashion must be massive and must form a long multiplet. These long multiplets are non-chiral and hence do not contribute to gravitational anomalies. Furthermore\nnone of the fields inside this multiplet are charged under other gauge groups. Therefore,\nwe see that these multiplets contribute neither to gravitational anomalies nor to unbroken\ngauge/mixed anomalies.\nBy this logic we can further state that all long multiplets obtained by U (1) gauge bosons\ncoupling to linear multiplets do not contribute to the anomaly polynomial. Therefore, we\nmay ignore all the long multiplets-or vector/linear multiplet pairs that couple-when we\nare discussing gravitational anomalies and gauge/mixed anomalies concerning unbroken\ngauge symmetry, i.e., gauge symmetry of the massless spectrum.\nLong multiplets and hence the generalized Green-Schwarz mechanism may thus be\nignored when we are discussing the massless spectrum of the theory. In other words, when\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\fwe are constructing low-energy effective theories, writing down anomalous U (1)'s and then\nlifting them is a redundant procedure. We may safely restrict our attention to the massless\nspectrum whose anomalies are all cancelled by two-forms; the factorization condition (2.6)\nshould hold for these theories.\n\n3. Bounds on T < 9 Theories With U(1)'s\nWe now address the first (I) of the four questions raised in the introduction. That is, we\nprove that the number of different gauge/matter structures- specified by the gauge group\nand the non-abelian representation of the matter-is finite for theories with T < 9, when\nwe ignore the charge of the matter under the U (1)'s.\nThe strategy we pursue is the following. First in section 3.1, we prove that in a\nnon-anomalous theory, the number of U (1)'s is bounded by a number determined by the\nnon-abelian gauge/matter content.

These bounds imply that the number of U (1)'s one could\nadd to a non-abelian theory is finite. We note that these bounds are in no sense optimal;\nthey could be improved by a more careful analysis. These inequalities, however, will be\nsufficient for the purpose of proving that there is a finite bound on theories with T < 9.\nIn section 3.2 we define the concept of 'curable theories' as non-abelian theories with\nH \u2212 V > 273 \u2212 29T that can be made non-anomalous by adding U (1) vector fields and\nwithout changing the non-abelian gauge/matter structure. Curable theories are defined so\nthat all non-anomalous theories with abelian gauge symmetry can be obtained by adding\nU (1)'s either to non-anomalous theories, or to curable theories. We then show that the\nnumber of curable theories is finite for T < 9, which combined with our other results\nimplies that the number of gauge/matter structures possible for non-anomalous theories\nwith T < 9 is finite.\nIn section 3.3 we construct an infinite class of non-anomalous theories with an unbounded number of U (1)'s and T \u2265 9.\n3.1 Bound on Number of U (1) Factors\nIn this section we prove equations (3.1) and (3.2) for non-anomalous theories with T < 9.\nGiven a gauge group\nVA\n\u03bd\nY\nY\nG\u03ba \u00d7\nU (1)i ,\n(3.3)\nG=\n\u03ba=1\n\ni=1\n\nwe show that the bound on VA can be given as a function of the number of nonabelian\nvector multiplets\nX\nVN A =\ndAdj\u03ba\n(3.4)\n\u03ba\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fand N , the number of nonabelian matter representations.\nThis can be done by making use of equation (2.30), which is equivalent to (2.25) :\n1X\nMI fI (xi )4\n3\nI\nX\n=\nMI qI,i qI,j qI,k qI,l\n\nP (xi ) * P (xi ) =\n\u21d4 bij * bkl + bik * bjl + bil * bjk\n\n(3.5)\n\nI\n\nWe should be looking for integral solutions of this equation for bij , qI,i , but for now we\nsimply determine the conditions for the equations to have real solutions.

We have used the fact that a + b \u2264 a+ b for non-negative a, b to simplify\nthe first inequality. The second inequality simply follows from solving (3.22) for VA when\nthe inequality is saturated. This result implies that given a non-anomalous non-abelian\ntheory, the number of U (1)'s one could add to the theory keeping it non-anomalous is\nbounded.\nThe equations we have used also apply to pure abelian theories. This is because we\nhave not used any constraint coming from the non-abelian structure of the theory; we have\nonly used the equation (3.5). Hence we can obtain a bound on the number of U (1)'s when\nthe theory is purely abelian:\nr\n7\n2225\n(3.25)\nVA \u2264 (T + 2)(T + ) + (T + 2) T 2 \u2212 51T +\n2\n4\nNote that this bound is substantially weaker than the tighter bound VA \u2264 17 for T = 0.\n(For T = 0 this bound states that VA \u2264 54, while we show that VA \u2264 17 in appendix B.)\n3.2 Curability and Finiteness of Curable Theories\nWe define 'curable' theories to be non-abelian theories that violate the gravitational anomaly\nbound H \u2212 V > 273 \u2212 29T , but whose anomaly polynomial can nonetheless be made factorizable by adding U (1) vector multiplets and some singlet hypermultiplets in such a way\nthat the gravitational bound is satisfied. There should also exist values for the scalars in\nthe tensor multiplets that make the kinetic terms of all gauge fields positive in the resulting\nnon-anomalous theory. We also assume that these theories do not have any hypermultiplets\nthat are singlets under the non-abelian gauge group.\nFrom this definition it is clear that all non-anomalous theories with abelian gauge\nsymmetry can be obtained by the following steps.\n1. Begin with a theory without abelian gauge group factors that is either non-anomalous\nor curable.\n2. Add abelian vector multiplets and (possibly) hypermultiplets in the trivial representation of the non-abelian gauge group.\n3. Assign U (1) charges to the matter.\nWe note that it is clear that the number of U (1)'s one could add to a given curable theory\nis finite, since it is bounded by (3.23) and (3.24). From this it is evident that the crucial\nremaining step in obtaining bounds on theories with abelian gauge symmetry is showing\nthat the number of curable theories is bounded.\nAs an example of a curable theory, consider the T = 0 theory with gauge group and\nmatter content\nSU (9) :\n\n26 \u00d7\n\n+1\u00d7\n\n+1\u00d7 ,\n\n(H \u2212 V = 274) .\n\n(3.26)\n\nAlthough this theory violates the gravitational anomaly bound, it satisfies the other gauge/mixed\nanomaly equations with b = 2. (Note that, as explained in section 2.6, when T = 0 the\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fanomaly coefficients a, b are numbers.) The theory (3.35) can be cured by adding a single\nU (1) vector multiplet and assigning charges to the matter in the following way\nSU (9) \u00d7 U (1) :\n\n6 \u00d7 ( , +1) + 6 \u00d7 ( , \u22121) + 14 \u00d7 ( , *)+\n1 \u00d7 ( , *) + 1 \u00d7 ( , *),\n\n(H \u2212 V = 273) .\n\n(3.27)\n\nThe anomaly polynomial of the final theory factorizes to\nI8 = \u2212\n\n1\n3\n2\n2\n2\n(\u2212 trR2 + 2trFSU\n(9) + 6FU (1) ) .\n32 2\n\n(3.28)\n\nA systematic classification of T = 0 supergravity models with SU (N ) gauge groups and\nwithout anomalies or other inconsistencies was given in [42], and F-theory constructions\nof such models were analyzed in[34]. The methods and results of those papers, in which\nabelian gauge group factors were not treated, can be expanded to include curable models\nsuch as this SU (9) theory. In particular, this presents a particularly simple example of\na model with a 3-index antisymmetric representation of SU (9) for which an F-theory\nrealization might be constructed.\nSince abelian vector multiplets and singlet hypermultiplets do not appear in a curable\ntheory and do not contribute to the nonabelian gauge/mixed anomalies, it is clear that the\nanomaly polynomial of a curable theory takes the form\n\u0012\n\u0013\n5\n(H \u2212 V \u2212 273 + 29T )\ntrR4 + (trR2 )2\n5760\n4\n!\n!\nX 2b\u03b1\nX 2b\u03b2\u03ba\n1\n1 \u03b1\n1\na trR2 +\n( \u03ba )trF\u03ba2\na\u03b2 trR2 +\n(\n)trF\u03ba2 ,\n\u2212 \u03a9\u03b1\u03b2\n32\n2\n\u03bb\n2\n\u03bb\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\u03ba\n\nI8 = \u2212\n\n(3.29)\n\nwhere H \u2212 V is larger than 273 \u2212 29T . One might think that any theory of this type\nis naively curable, since we could apparently add an arbitrary number of U (1) vector\nmultiplets under which no matter field is charged, so that H \u2212 V \u2032 = 273 \u2212 29T . The kinetic\nterm for these vector fields, however, would be degenerate-in fact zero-if we do so. In\nfact, in many cases the bounds on the number of U (1) factors that can be added to a theory\nmake it impossible to cure nonabelian theories with anomalies of the form (3.29).\nIn [38, 40] it was proven that the number of distinct nonabelian gauge groups and\nmatter representations possible for theories with T < 9 and no U (1) factors is finite. The\nbound Hcharged \u2212V \u2264 273\u221229T from the gravitational anomaly condition played a key role\nin this proof, limiting the number of charged hypermultiplets that could appear in a theory\nwith any given nonabelian gauge group. To prove that the number of curable theories is\nalso finite for T < 9 we need an analogous constraint on the number of hypermultiplets for\ntheories with U (1) factors. We now find such a bound, using the bounds (3.23) and (3.24)\non the number of U (1) factors that can be added to a curable theory.\nSuppose a theory is curable by adding VA U (1) vector multiplets and H \u2032 hypermulti-\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fplets. Then using (3.23) we obtain\n273 \u2212 29T \u2265 (H \u2212 V )cured theory = H \u2212 V + H \u2032 \u2212 VA\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u2265 H \u2212 V + H \u2032 \u2212 2(T + 2) H \u2032 + N \u2212 2(T + 2)\n\u221a\n(T + 2) 2\n1\n) \u2212 N \u2212 ( T 2 + 4T + 6) ,\n= (H \u2212 V ) + ( H \u2032 + N \u2212 \u221a\n2\n2\n\n(3.30)\n\nwhere H, V and N denote the numbers of hypermultiplets, vector multiplets and hypermultiplet representations in the initial non-abelian theory. Since H \u2032 \u2265 0, when N \u2264 (T + 2)2 /2\nwe have\n\u221a\n(T + 2) 2\n(T + 2)2\n( H\u2032 + N \u2212 \u221a\n,\n(3.31)\n) \u2212N \u2265\u2212\n2\n2\nwhile when N \u2265 (T + 2)2 /2 we have\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(T + 2) 2\n(T + 2) 2\n(T + 2)2\n) \u2212N \u2265 ( N \u2212 \u221a\n) \u2212 N = \u2212 2(T + 2) N +\n. (3.32)\n( H\u2032 + N \u2212 \u221a\n2\n2\n2\nThus, any curable theory satisfies one of the following two constraints:\nH \u2212 V \u2264 273 \u2212 29T + (T 2 + 6T + 8)\n\u221a\n\u221a\nH \u2212 V \u2212 2(T + 2) N \u2264 273 \u2212 29T + (2T + 4)\n\n(3.33)\n(3.34)\n\nCurable theories therefore must satisfy the non-abelian factorization equations (2.15)\u2013\n(2.19) and one of these modified gravitational anomaly constraints.\nThis result suggests that the proof in [38, 40] can be modified to show that the number\nof curable theories are in fact finite. There it was shown that the H of theories that obey\nthe non-abelian factorization equations-and can have a positive kinetic term-grew faster\nthan the V of the theory when V became large. This in turn implied that V must be\nbounded for theories that satisfy the the non-abelian factorization equations and respect\nthe H \u2212 V bound. We have shown that curable theories must obey the same non-abelian\nfactorization equations with the H \u2212 V constraint modified. Fortunately, this constant is\nonly modified by a term subleading in N < H. This suggests that the boundedness of\ncurable theories can be shown along the same lines as the proof of boundedness of non\u221a\nabelian theories. This is indeed the case, though the added term proportional to N\ncomplicate some parts of the analysis. The details of the full proof of this statement are\npresented in appendix A.\nWe note that the equations (3.33) and (3.34) enable us to identify many uncurable\ntheories with ease. For example, it can be shown that the T = 0 theory with gauge group\nand matter content\nSU (7) :\n\n27 \u00d7\n\n+1\u00d7\n\n,\n\n(H \u2212 V = 351)\n\n(3.35)\n\nis uncurable, since\nH \u2212 V > 273 \u2212 29T + (T 2 + 6T + 8) = 281\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nH \u2212 V > 273 \u2212 29T + (2T + 4) + 2(T + 2) N = 277 + 2 56 = 291.9...\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n(3.36)\n(3.37)\n\n\fTo summarize, we have defined 'curable theories' to be supergravity theories that\nsatisfy the following conditions:\n1. The gauge group is non-abelian.\n2. The theory has no singlet hypermultiplets.\n3. H \u2212 V > 273 \u2212 29T\n4. The theory can be made non-anomalous by adding U (1) vector fields that are independent degrees of freedom, as well as possibly adding singlet hypermultiplets.\n5. In the resulting non-anomalous theory, there exists a choice for the scalars in the\ntensor multiplets that makes the kinetic terms of all gauge fields positive.\nWe have proven the following facts:\n1. The number of non-anomalous non-abelian theories is finite [38].\n2. The number of U (1)'s one can add to non-anomalous theories is finite.\n3. The number of curable theories is finite.\n4. The number of U (1)'s one can add to curable theories is finite.\nAs pointed out in the beginning of this section, any non-anomalous theory with U (1)'s\ncan be constructed by adding abelian vector multiplets and neutral hypermultiplets to a\nnon-anomalous or curable theory with no abelian gauge symmetry. Hence it follows that\nthere is only a finite number of distinct gauge/matter structures a 6D (1, 0) theory could\nhave even when we allow abelian components to the gauge group. In particular, this implies\nthat the total rank of the gauge group is bounded, even when we admit abelian factors in\nthe gauge group.\n3.3 T \u2265 9\nIn this section, we show that for T \u2265 9 a bound cannot be imposed on the number of\nU (1)'s as we have done in the case T < 9. We first show that there are certain classes of\ntheories to which one could add an arbitrary number of U (1)'s, and discuss why this is\nnot possible when T < 9. We end with an example of an infinite class of non-anomalous\ntheories with an unbounded number of U (1)'s.\nSuppose we have a theory T0 with gauge group G0 that satisfies all the anomaly equations and has an SO(1, T ) unit vector j0 that satisfies j0 * b\u03ba > 0 for all gauge groups \u03ba.\nDenote the number of vector and hypermultiplets of this theory as V0 and H0 .\nSuppose an SO(1, T ) vector b that satisfies the following conditions exists:\n1. b is light-like, i.e., b2 = 0.\n2. a * b = 0.\n3. b\u03ba * b = 0 for all \u03ba.\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\f4. b * j0 > 0.\nRecall that in the case T < 9 it is impossible for a vector b to satisfy conditions 1, 2 and 4\nat the same time. In that case a is a time-like vector and if 1 and 2 are satisfied, b must be\na zero vector. This is what prevented us from having a U (1) with nothing charged under\nit.\nThe situation is quite different when T \u2265 9; in this case a vector b satisfying the four\nconditions above is not ruled out in general. Once such a b is available one could construct\ntheory Tk from T0 with the following properties.\n1. The gauge group is Gk = G0 \u00d7 U (1)k .\n2. The matter content is that of T0 with k neutral hypermultiplets added.\n3. Nothing is charged under the U (1)'s, i.e., qI,j = 0 for all I, j.\n4. The non-abelian anomaly coefficients are given by b\u03ba .\n5. The abelian anomaly coefficients are given by bij = \u03b4ij b.\n6. The tensor multiplet scalar vacuum expectation value is given by j0 .\nBy adding the k neutral hypermultiplets, the gravitational anomaly condition,\nHk \u2212 Vk = (H0 + k) \u2212 (V0 + k) = H0 \u2212 V0 = 273 \u2212 29T\n\n(3.38)\n\nis satisfied. The non-abelian anomaly factorization conditions are all satisfied by definition.\nWe find that all the U (1) anomaly equations (2.22)-(2.25) are also satisfied as both sides\nof the equation turn out to be 0. Also,\nj0 * bij = (j0 * b)\u03b4ij\n\n(3.39)\n\nis a positive definite matrix by the assumption that b * j0 > 0. Therefore, this theory\nsatisfies all the anomaly equations and has a sensible kinetic term. Since this is true for\nany k we find that we could add an infinite number of U (1)'s to T0 .\nWe conclude this section by presenting an explicit example of an infinite class of theories\nwith an unbounded number of U (1) factors in the gauge group. The simplest case, when\nthere are no non-abelian factors, turns out to serve our purpose. A U (1)k theory with\n273 \u2212 29T + k neutral hypermultiplets and a, bij given by\na = (\u22123, 1 \u00d7 T, 0, * * * , 0),\n\nbij = b\u03b4ij\n\nfor b = (3, (\u22121) \u00d7 9, 0, * * * , 0)\n\n(3.40)\n\nsatisfies all the factorization equations. x \u00d7 n denotes that n consecutive components have\nthe same value x. Defining\nj = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, * * * , 0) ,\n(3.41)\nwe find that the matrix for the kinetic term of the vector multiplets\nj * bij = 3 \u03b4ij\nis positive definite. k is bounded below by 29T \u2212 273 but has no upper-bound.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n(3.42)\n\n\f4. Infinite Classes of Non-anomalous Theories with U(1)'s\nIn this section, we investigate the second and third questions (II and III) posed in the\nintroduction, beginning with II: Given the gauge/matter content of the theory-by which\nwe mean that we fix the gauge group and the representations of the hypermultiplets with\nrespect to the non-abelian part of the gauge group-are there an infinite number of solutions to the U (1) charge equations? We denote these U (1) charge equations 'hypercharge'\nequations.\nAs pointed out in the introduction, there are infinite families of solutions that may be\n'trivially generated' in the following sense. There certainly exist solutions of the anomaly\nequations with gauge group G = G0 \u00d7 U (1)2 . In such a case, denoting the charge vectors\n~ = r~q1 + s~q2 solves\nwith respect to the two U (1)'s ~q1 and ~q2 , any linear combination Q\n\u2032\nthe anomaly equation for G = G0 \u00d7 U (1) with the same matter structure. On top of the\nanomaly cancellation conditions, we may demand that additional consistency conditions be\nobeyed [54, 55, 56, 57]. Three such conditions are applicable to six-dimensional supergravity\ntheories with compact U (1) abelian factors:\n1. Charge Integrality Constraint : All charges of particles should be integral with\nrespect to the minimal charge of the U (1)'s.\n2. Minimal Charge Constraint : The greatest common divisor of the charges of all\nparticles under each U (1) should coincide with the minimal charge\u2013or inverse of the\nperiodicity\u2013of the U (1).\n3. Unimodularity Constraint : The string charge lattice spanned by the anomaly\ncoefficients should be embeddable in a unimodular lattice.\nThe first and second constraints do not stop us from generating an infinite familiy because\nif the initial theory with G = G0 \u00d7 U (1)2 satisfied the charge integrality constraint and the\nminimal charge constraint, the new theory would also satisfy this constraint when r, s are\ntaken to be mutually prime integers. In many cases the unimodularity constraint does not\nhelp either, as we see shortly.\nLet us depict the situation with the simplest example. For G = U (1)2 , T = 1 the\nfollowing charges on the 246 hypermultiplets of the theory solve the anomaly equations.\nAssume that there are 48 hypermultiplets with charge (0, 1), 48 hypermultiplets with charge\n(1, 0), 48 hypermultiplets with charge (1, 1) and 102 neutral hypermultiplets. Written in\nterms of charge vectors\nq1 = (1 \u00d7 96, 0 \u00d7 48, 0 \u00d7 102),\n~\n\n~q2 = (0 \u00d7 48, 1 \u00d7 96, 0 \u00d7 102) ,\n\n(4.1)\n\nwhere q \u00d7 n denotes that n consecutive components have the same value q. The only\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\fnon-trivial anomaly equations concerned are\n1\n(48x21 + 48(x1 + x2 )2 + 48x22 ) = (\u03b111 + \u03b1\u030311 )x21 + 2(\u03b112 + \u03b1\u030312 )x1 x2 + (\u03b122 + \u03b1\u030322 )x22\n6\n(4.2)\n2\n(48x41 + 48(x1 + x2 )4 + 48x42 ) = (\u03b111 x21 + 2\u03b112 x1 x2 + \u03b122 x22 )(\u03b1\u030311 x21 + 2\u03b1\u030312 x1 x2 + \u03b1\u030322 x22 )\n3\n(4.3)\nBoth equations are satisfied by the choice\n\u03b111 = \u03b122 = 2\u03b112 = \u03b1\u030311 = \u03b1\u030322 = 2\u03b1\u030312 = 8 .\n\n(4.4)\n\n~ = (r \u00d7 48, (r + s) \u00d7 48, s \u00d7 48, 0 \u00d7 102)\nQ\n\n(4.5)\n\nTherefore\nsatisfy the equations\n1\n(48r 2 + 48(r + s)2 + 48s2 ) = 16r 2 + 16rs + 16s2\n6\n2\n(48r 4 + 48(r + s)4 + 48s4 ) = (8r 2 + 8rs + 8s2 )2 .\n3\n\n(4.6)\n(4.7)\n\nIt is easy to see that this choice of charges solves the anomaly equation for G = U (1) with\n\u03b1 = \u03b1\u0303 = (8r 2 +8rs+8s2 ). Therefore, we obtain an infinite class of solutions to the anomaly\nequations for G = U (1).\nIt is clear that imposing the charge integrality constraint and the minimal charge\nconstraint does not stop us from generating this infinite family as we may take r and s\nto be mutually prime integers. Now we show that the unimodularity constraint is also\nsatisfied when r and s are integers.\nIt is useful to notice that when T = 1, a sufficient condition for the unimodularity\nconstraint is that all the anomaly coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0303 defined in section 2.5 are even\nintegers. This is because if all \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0303 are even integers, all string charge vectors\n!\n!\n1 \u03b1\n\u22122\n(4.8)\na=\n, b=\n2 \u03b1\u0303\n\u22122\nare embeddable in the unimodular lattice spanned by\n!\n!\n1\n0\nand\n,\n0\n1\n\n(4.9)\n\nwith inner product structure \u03a9 as defined in (2.41). When r, s are integers, \u03b1 and \u03b1\u0303 of\nthe U (1) are both equal to (8r 2 + 8rs + 8s2 ), which is an even integer. Therefore, the\nunimodularity constraint does not rule out this infinite class of theories.\nThe natural follow-up question to ask is whether there is some gauge/matter structure\nthat permits an infinite number of distinct solutions to the hypercharge equations that\ncannot be lifted to a theory with more U (1)'s. It turns out that there are infinite classes\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fof solutions to anomaly equations of a theory with gauge group G0 \u00d7 U (1) that cannot be\nlifted to G0 \u00d7 U (1)2 . The example we examine is the theory with gauge group SU (13) \u00d7\nU (1) that we presented at the end of section 2.5. There we found a solution to the nonabelian factorization condition with 4 antisymmetrics, 6 fundamentals and 23 singlets in\nthe SU (13). The non-abelian part of the factorized polynomial is\n\u2212\n\n1\n2\n2\n2\n(trR2 \u2212 2trFSU\n(13) ) \u2227 (trR \u2212 2trFSU (13) ) .\n16\n\n(4.10)\n\nDenoting the charge of hypermultiplets in the antisymmetric/fundamental/singlet representation as ax (x = 1, * * * , 4)/fy (y = 1, * * * , 6)/sz (z = 1, * * * , 23) the anomaly equations\nbecome\nX\nX\n9\nax +\nfy = 0\n(4.11)\n78\n\nX\n\na4x + 13\n\nx\n\n78\n\nX\n\nx\n\ny\n\nX\n\nX\n\nfy4 +\n\ny\n\na2x + 13\n\nx\n\nX\n\nz\n\nfy2 +\n\ny\n\n44\n\nX\nx\n\ns4z =\n\na2x + 4\n\nX\n\n3\n\u03b1\u03b1\u0303\n2\n\n(4.12)\n\ns2z = 6\u03b1 + 6\u03b1\u0303\n\n(4.13)\n\nfy2 = 2\u03b1 + 2\u03b1\u0303\n\n(4.14)\n\nz\n\nX\ny\n\nThere is an ansatz that solves this equation given by\n2\n(ax ) = (\u22123a \u2212 f, a, a, a)\n3\n(fy ) = (f, f, f, f, f, f )\n(sz ) = ((6a + f ) \u00d7 18, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n\n(4.15)\n(4.16)\n(4.17)\n\nwhere in the last line we mean that 18 of the sz take the value (6a+f ) while five take 0. This\nansatz satisfies the first equation and renders the third and fourth equations equivalent.\nThen the second and third equation can be solved with respect to \u03b1, \u03b1\u0303 to yield\ni\np\n\u221a\n\u03b1 \u03b1\u0303\n2h\n2\n2\n(4.18)\n39(1\n+\n6t)\n23\n\u2212\n24t\n\u2212\n36t\n(49\n+\n198t\n+\n594t\n)\n\u00b1\n,\n=\nf2 f2\n9\n\nwhere we have defined t = a/f . It is easy to see that \u03b1, \u03b1\u0303 are real as long as\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u22122 \u2212 3 3\n\u22122 + 3 3\n\u2264t\u2264\n.\n6\n6\n\n(4.19)\n\nBoth \u03b1, \u03b1\u0303 are positive when t is in this range. Hence we see that there are an infinite\nnumber of integral hypercharge solutions to the equations (4.11)-(4.14) that give allowed\nvalues of \u03b1, \u03b1\u0303.\nIt is clear that this theory cannot be lifted to a theory with gauge group SU (13)\u00d7U (1)2 .\nAlthough the ansatz for the given solution seems to imply that this theory can be lifted,\nfor example by choosing the charges for one U (1) to be proportional to a and the charges\nfor the other U (1) to be proportional to f , the fact that a/f must lie in a certain range\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fimplies that there must be an obstruction to doing this. The obstruction is that if one\ntries to lift the theory to a theory with gauge group SU (13) \u00d7 U (1)2 , the matrices \u03b1ij and\n\u03b1\u0303ij of this theory cannot be made into positive definite real matrices as is required for the\nU (1) gauge fields to have positive-definite kinetic terms.\nThe next question to ask is whether there is an infinite subclass of these theories that\nsatisfy all three quantum consistency conditions introduced at the beginning of this section.\nGenerating a subclass of theories that satisfy the integrality constraint and the minimum\ncharge constraint is not difficult. For example, by taking f and a to be mutually prime\nintegers and f to be a multiple of 3, one can generate an infinite class of solutions that\nsatisfy these two constraints. These conditions, however, do not lead to the unimodularity\nconstraint.\nIn order to construct a subclass of theories that satisfy all three constraints, let us\nexamine whether there exists an infinite number of rational values of t that make the right\nhand side of (4.18) rational. This problem boils down to the question of whether the\nequation\n23 \u2212 24t \u2212 36t2 = 39q 2\n(4.20)\nadmits an infinite number of solutions with rational t and q. We find that there indeed are\nan infinite number of rational solutions to this equation using methods outlined in chapter\n7 of [58]. When\n13k2 \u2212 234k \u2212 51\na\n=t=\n(4.21)\nf\n24(13k2 + 3)\nfor k rational we find that\n\u03b1\n13\n=\n2\nf\n144(3 + 13k2 )2\n\u03b1\u0303\n13\n=\nf2\n144(3 + 13k2 )2\n\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\n6687 + 54756k + 94458k2 \u2212 124956k3 + 39455k4\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0003\n2475 + 37908k + 170274k2 \u2212 29484k3 + 9035k4 .\n\n(4.22)\n(4.23)\n\nHence we find that the number of non-anomalous theories with SU (13) \u00d7 U (1) with this\nparticular type of matter content is infinite.\nTo be clear, we now spell out the explicit subclass of theories that satisfy all three quantum consistency conditions. Setting k = r/s for integers r and s in the above equations,\nwe find that when\na = 13r 2 \u2212 234rs \u2212 51s2\n2\n\n2\n\nf = 24(13r + 3s ) ,\n\n\u03b1 and \u03b1\u0303 take on the values\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1 = 52 6687s4 + 54756s3 r + 94458s2 r 2 \u2212 124956sr 3 + 39455r 4\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03b1\u0303 = 52 2475s4 + 37908s3 r + 170274s2 r 2 \u2212 29484sr 3 + 9035r 4 ,\n\n(4.24)\n(4.25)\n\n(4.26)\n(4.27)\n\nwhich are even integers. As discussed early on in this section, this implies that the string\ncharge lattice can be embedded in a unimodular lattice. It is clear that this ansatz assigns\ninteger charges to all the fields and hence the charge integrality constraint is also satisfied.\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fIf a and (\u22123a \u2212 2f /3) are mutually prime, the minimal charge constraint is also satisfied.\nThere are an infinite number of integer pairs (r, s) that render a and (\u22123a\u22122f /3) mutually\nprime. In fact, we can show that when\nr = 84n + 43\n\n(4.28)\n\ns = 182n + 92\n\n(4.29)\n\nfor integer n, a and (\u22123a \u2212 2f /3) are mutually prime. This fact is proven in appendix C.\nWe have found a particular gauge/matter structure with one U (1) that has an infinite\nnumber of distinct solutions to the hypercharge equations for T = 1. Furthermore the\ntheory cannot be lifted to a theory with two U (1)'s for these hypercharge assignments.\nThe situation is rather subtle for the case of T = 0. The equations (2.76)-(2.79) make\nit clear that any infinite class of solutions to the anomaly equation with charge vectors of\nthe form\n~ = r~q1 + s~q2\nQ\n(4.30)\nfor one U (1) can be lifted to U (1)2 . As in the T = 1 case there are a plethora of examples\nof gauge/matter structure that admit an infinite family of hypercharge solutions in this\nway. If, however, we want to identify an infinite class of theories that satisfy anomaly\nequations for a single U (1) factor that cannot be extended to U (1)2 , we cannot have a\nsimple linear ansatz as in the T = 1 case. Examining some specific examples of T = 0\ntheories gives interesting number theory problems that in some cases seem to have infinite\nU (1) families that cannot be extended to U (1)2 models, but we do not go into the details\nof these constructions here.\n\n5. Conclusions\nWe have considered 6D supergravity theories with (1, 0) supersymmetry with abelian as\nwell as nonabelian gauge group factors. The following statements have been proven for\nsuch theories when the number of tensor multiplets T satisfies T < 9:\n1. The number of abelian vector multiplets is bounded above by (3.23) and (3.24). The\nupper bound is determined by the nonabelian gauge/matter content.\n2. The number of possible gauge groups and nonabelian matter content is finite, though\nthere are families with infinite numbers of possible distinct U (1) charges.\nFrom (2), it immediately follows that\n3. There is a global bound on the rank of the gauge group of any non-anomalous 6D\nN = (1, 0) theory with T < 9.\nThe conclusions we have reached for theories with abelian factors are in some ways\nclosely parallel to the analogous results bounding the space of 6D supergravity theories\nwith only nonabelian factors [38, 39]. Adding abelian factors does not change the basic\nresult that the set of possible gauge groups and nonabelian matter representations is finite\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\ffor T < 9. The biggest difference for theories with abelian gauge group factors is that\nwe cannot bound the number of distinct possibilities for U (1) charges. Even this result,\nhowever, fits naturally into the pattern of theories with nonabelian gauge groups for small\nT . In [42], we analyzed the set of allowed 6D theories with SU (N ) gauge groups and no\ntensor fields (T = 0). For large N the bounds on the set of allowed representations of\nSU (N ) under which matter fields transform are quite stringent. As N decreases, however,\nmore and more exotic matter representations are allowed by the anomaly conditions and\nother known low-energy constraints. For SU (3) there are over 10,000 different matter\ncombinations possible, and for SU (2) there are many millions of combinations possible,\nincluding, for example, matter in the 113-index symmetric tensor representation (114).\nThe infinite range of possible U (1) charges seems like a natural divergent limit to this\nrange of theories.\nThese results naturally lead to the question of whether it is possible to place stronger\nbounds on the set of consistent 6D theories than those understood from anomaly cancellation and other known constraints, either from string theory or from other macroscopic\nconsiderations. For theories without abelian factors, this question has led to an improved\nunderstanding of the space of 6D theories. F-theory [21, 59] gives a method for constructing a very general class of 6D theories. By relating discrete structure of the low-energy\ntheory to topological structure of F-theory constructions, additional constraints placed by\nF-theory on the low-energy 6D theory have been identified for theories with nonabelian\ngauge groups [39]. One such condition is that the dyonic string charge lattice of the lowenergy theory, which contains the anomaly lattice spanned by the SO(1, T ) vectors bi , must\nbe self-dual. This condition was shown to be a requirement for quantum consistency of\nany 6D supergravity theory in [57]. A second condition that is imposed by F-theory on supersymmetric theories is the Kodaira constraint that the total elliptically fibered space be\nCalabi-Yau. For theories with T = 0 and SU (N ) gauge group, for example, this constraint\nimplies that \u221212a = 36 \u2265 N b, where b is the anomaly coefficient for the SU (N ) gauge\ngroup. This condition places an additional constraint on the set of possible SU (N ) theories\nbeyond the conditions imposed by anomaly cancellation. While all T = 0 SU (N ) models\nwith N > 8 that satisfy anomaly cancellation also automatically satisfy this Kodaira constraint, this constraint places increasingly strong additional restrictions on SU (N ) theories\nfor small N . In particular, this condition reduces the millions of possible models with\nexotic matter representations for theories with SU (2) gauge group to less than 200 models, with the largest representation appearing being the 6 of SU (2) [42]. More generally,\nthe Kodaira constraint rules out all known infinite families of 6D theories with nonabelian\ngauge groups, even for T \u2265 9, consistent with the known fact that there are a finite number\nof different possible gauge groups and matter content for F-theory constructions [39]. It\nis an open question whether (a) the Kodaira constraint can be realized from the point of\nview of 6D supergravity as a general consistency condition on any quantum theory, (b) this\nconstraint depends crucially on the UV-completion and represents a constraint intrinsic to\nstring theory, or (c) there are other more exotic string constructions beyond F-theory that\ncan realize theories violating the Kodaira constraint.\nSince F-theory can also only allow a finite number of possible U (1) charges for any\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\fclass of theories, it seems that a constraint analogous to the Kodaira constraint must hold\nfor theories with abelian gauge group factors. Such a constraint should place bounds on the\nU (1) anomaly coefficients bij , leading to constraints on abelian charges through equation\n(2.22). The origin of such a constraint in F-theory is less clear for abelian factors than\nfor nonabelian factors, however, since abelian factors arise in a global and less transparent\nfashion in F-theory than nonabelian factors. Some progress in formulating abelian factors\ngeometrically in F-theory that may be relevant to this problem will appear in [60].\nAnother question whose resolution may help shed light on the issues addressed by this\npaper is the determination of the precise limit on the number of U (1) factors that may\narise in a 6D supergravity theory with fixed nonabelian gauge group and matter structure.\nThe simplest case of this question is when T = 0 and there is no nonabelian gauge group.\nWe know that F-theory models exist with up to k = 7 U (1) factors, though the explicit\ngeometry is only known up to k = 3, and the upper bound found here of k < 17 is\nprobably not optimal. It would be interesting to find methods for decreasing the upper\nbound and/or constructing explicit F-theory models with larger k both in this simplest\ncase and more generally. Recently, an impressive list of toric Calabi-Yau threefolds that\nare elliptic fibrations over P2 have been put together in [50]. Obtaining an upper bound\non k for F-theory compactifications on these manifolds seems to be a goal attainable in the\nnear future.\nFinally, understanding U (1) factors in supergravity and string constructions presents\na similar challenge in four dimensions, though with additional subtleties. It seems likely\nthat further progress on understanding U (1) factors in six dimensions will also shed light\non the 4D problem.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Allan Adams, Mboyo Esole, I\u00f1aki Garc\u0131\u0301a-Etxebarria, Thomas\nGrimm, James Halverson, Vijay Kumar, Joe Marsano, John McGreevy, and David Morrison for helpful discussions.

Proof of Bound on Curable Theories\nWe prove that the number of curable theories as defined in section 3.2 is finite for T < 9.\nThe crucial fact we use is that for curable theories one of the two following conditions must\nhold:\n\nH \u2212V \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\nH \u2212 V \u2264 273 \u2212 29T + (T 2 + 6T + 8)\n\u221a\n2(T + 2) N \u2264 273 \u2212 29T + (2T + 4)\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\n\fwhere N is the number of hypermultiplet representations of the theory. It is clear from\n[38, 40] that there could not be an infinite family of theories for which the first condition\nholds as it requires H \u2212 V to be bounded. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that there\ndoes not exist an infinite family of curable theories for which the second condition (A.2)\nholds. It proves convenient to define\nT +2\nc(T ) \u2261 \u221a .\n2\n\n(A.3)\n\nBefore presenting the proof of the desired result, we will point out that the proof is\nvery similar to that given for non-abelian theories in [38, 40]. Proofs of the existence of\nbounds on non-anomalous theories are carried out by two steps in these references. First,\nthe authors identify infinite classes of theories that satisfy all the anomaly equations other\nthan the gravitational anomaly bound, and that have positive kinetic terms for the gauge\nfields. Then they show that it is impossible for all the theories in that infinite class to\nsatisfy the gravitational anomaly bound. This is proven by showing that as the total rank\nof the gauge group increases, the increase of H is much faster than V . This proves that\nconstructing an infinite class of theories that satisfy all the anomaly cancellation conditions\nand that have positive kinetic terms for the gauge fields does not exist.\nWe also take the same approach in proving our bounds. In our case, however, we must\n\u221a\nprove that the increase of H \u2212 c(T ) N is much faster than V for the infinite classes of\n\u221a\ntheories one could construct. Most of our effort will be put in to showing that N does\nnot increase so fast as to affect the growth of H.\nThere are infinite classes of theories that this is easy to show. For example, for the\nclass of theories whose H and V exhibit a scaling behavior with respect to the rank of\nthe total gauge group when it becomes large, the arguments presented in [38, 40] can be\nvirtually repeated. This is because equation (A.2) implies that\n\u221a\n( H \u2212 c(T ))2 \u2212 V \u2264 277 \u2212 27T + c(T )2 .\n\n(A.4)\n\nThis is because as we have assumed there exist no singlets in curable theories, and hence\nH\n<H\n(A.5)\n2\n\u221a\nholds. Therefore, the scaling behavior of ( H \u2212 c(T ))2 \u2212 V and H \u2212 V with respect\nto the rank is equivalent and the boundedness argument for these classes of theories are\nessentially the same. In particular, for an infinite class of theories whose simple group\nfactors have bounded rank, the proof of boundedness given in [38, 40] can be used with\nvery little adjustments. This is presented in section A.1.\nIt is, however, worth pointing out that for some infinite class of theories, the situation\nis rather subtle. When there exist simple group factors with unbounded rank in the infinite\nclass of theories, the bound (A.4) becomes too delicate to use. In that case the stronger\nbound (A.2) turns out to be more useful in proving the existence of bounds of curable\ntheories. We will carry this out in section A.2.\nN\u2264\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\fWe now turn to presenting the complete proof of the bound on curable theories. We\nproceed by reductio ad absurdum. Let us assume there is an infinite family of curable\n\u221a\nQ\nnon-abelian theories with gauge group \u03ba G\u03ba . Due to the bound on H \u2212 V \u2212 2c N >\n\u221a\n( H \u2212 c)2 \u2212 V \u2212 c2 , we see that theories in an infinite family of curable theories should\nbe unbounded in the dimension of the gauge group. If not, H and V are both bounded,\nand hence only a finite number of theories can be constructed. There are two ways an\nunbounded family can occur. These are given as the following:\n1. The dimension of each G\u03ba , or equivalently, dAdj\u03ba is bounded, but the number of simple\nfactors is unbounded in this family.\n2. The dimension of a single simple group factor G\u03ba is unbounded.\nWe show that both kinds of families cannot exist in the following subsections.\nAn important fact we use throughout the proof is the fact that,\n!\nNumber of pairs of G\u03b9 6= G\u03ba\nH\u2265\nfor which there exists a jointly charged hypermultiplet.\n\n(A.6)\n\n= (Number of pairs of G\u03b9 6= G\u03ba with b\u03b9 * b\u03ba 6= 0.)\nThis can be shown in the following way.\nSuppose a hypermultiplet representation I is charged under \u03bb \u2265 2 gauge groups.

Therefore, H \u2212 V \u2212 2c N cannot be bounded when\neach simple group factor of the infinite family has bounded rank. This rules out case 1.\nA.2 Case 2 : Unbounded Simple Group Factors\nLet us assume that there exists an infinite number of curable theories with a simple group\nfactor that is unbounded. This is possible if the gauge group contains a classical group\nH(N ) (which is either SU , SO or Sp) with unbounded rank. In this case, there would\nbe an infinite subfamily whose gauge group is given by H(N ) \u00d7 GN with fixed classical\nQ\u03bd(N )\ngroup type H, and GN = \u03ba=1 G\u03ba an arbitrary product of simple gauge groups with N\nunbounded. It is shown in [38] that when N is large, the H(N ) block must be among those\ngiven in table 4.\nLet us enumerate the hypermultiplet representations charged under H(N ) with indices,\n\u2032\nI = 1, * * * , N \u2032 and the ones uncharged(and hence charged only under other gauge group\nfactors) as I \u2032\u2032 = N \u2032 + 1, * * * , (N \u2032 + N \u2032\u2032 ). Note that (N \u2032 + N \u2032\u2032 ) = N . We call the former\n\n\u2013 39 \u2013\n\n\fhypermultiplets I \u2032 hypermultiplets and the latter I \u2032\u2032 hypermultiplets.

We shortly see that this is not possible for arbitrary large N .

There are again two kinds of behavior of GN under N \u2192 \u221e. It can\nconsist of simple gauge factors of bounded rank, or it can have a simple gauge factor whose\nrank is unbounded. We consider these cases separately.\nA.2.1 Case 2-1 : Rank of Simple Gauge Group Factors of GN Bounded\nAssume that the dimensions of of the simple gauge group factors are bounded by D.\nDenoting \u03bd(N ) as the number of gauge group factors, as previously mentioned, we see that\n\u221a\n\u221a\n(A.25)\nH \u2032\u2032 \u2212 V \u2032\u2032 \u2212 2c N > ( H \u2032\u2032 \u2212 c)2 \u2212 c2 \u2212 D\u03bd(N )\nmust behave as \u2212O(N 2 ) for large N . Therefore,\n\u03bd(N ) \u2265 O(N 2 ) .\n\n(A.26)\n\nHence we must have an infinite family of theories where the number of simple gauge group\nfactors of GN increase at least as O(N 2 ).

A Bound on the Number of Vector Multiplets for\nPure Abelian Theories with T = 0\nIn the case that T = 0 and the gauge group is purely abelian, we can obtain a lower bound\non the number of charged hypermultiplets as a function of the the total rank of the gauge\ngroup. Similar bounds may be obtained for other values of T < 9 though they are less\nstringent.\nWe label the U (1) gauge groups by i = 1, * * * , VA . The gravitational anomaly condition\nimposes that the number of hypermultiplets is equal to VA + 273.

Let us define\n2\n2\ng \u2261 gcd(a, \u22123a \u2212 f ) = gcd(a, f ) .\n3\n3\n\n(C.5)\n\nOur goal is to show that g = 1.\nWe first acknowledge that r and s are mutually prime. This is because\ngcd(r, s)|(13r \u2212 6s)\n\n(C.6)\n\n13r \u2212 6s = 7 .\n\n(C.7)\n\nand\nIt is clear, however, that 7 and r are mutually prime. Therefore, gcd(r, s) must be 1, and\nhence r and s must be mutually prime. Meanwhile, a is odd since r is even and s is odd.\nTherefore g must also be odd, i.e. 2 \u2224 g. Also, g is not divisible by 3. We can show 3 \u2224 g by\nnoting that g | (13r 2 + 3s2 ) and that\n13r 2 + 3s2 \u2261 1\n\n(mod 3) .\n\n(C.8)\n\nLet us show that g = 1.

Using standard properties of the greatest common\ndivisor, we further find that\ng = gcd(13r 2 \u2212 234rs \u2212 51s2 , 13r 2 + 3s2 )\n= gcd(\u2212234rs \u2212 54s2 , 13r 2 + 3s2 )\n\n= gcd(\u2212234r \u2212 54s, 13r 2 + 3s2 ) = gcd(\u221218(13r + 3s), 13r 2 + 3s2 )\n\n(C.10)\n\n= gcd(13r + 3s, 13r 2 + 3s2 )\n\nIn the penultimate line we have used the fact that\ngcd(s, 13r 2 + 3s2 ) = gcd(s, 13r 2 ) = 1\n\n(C.11)\n\nsince s \u2261 1 (mod 13) and s and r are mutually prime. In the last line we have used 2 \u2224 g\nand 3 \u2224 g.\nTherefore, g must be a divisor of\n\u2212(13r + 3s)(13 \u2212 3s) + 13(13r 2 + 3s2 ) = 48s2 .\n\n(C.12)\n\nWe have seen in (C.11) that s is mutually prime with 13r 2 + 3s2 . Therefore, g is mutually\nprime with s and hence\ng|23 \u00d7 3 .\n(C.13)\nWe, however, know that 2 \u2224 g and 3 \u2224 g.
