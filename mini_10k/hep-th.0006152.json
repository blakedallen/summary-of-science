For the standard spinning string in a\nflat background [1], such an action has been known for\nmore than 20 years [2]. It played an important r\u00f4le in\nstring theory, in particular as starting point for covariant\nquantization, and was extended to general backgrounds\n[3]. In this letter we present analogous actions for the\nsuper-D-string, i.e. locally supersymmetric world-sheet\nactions of the Born-Infeld type. To our knowledge, such\nactions have not been explicitly constructed previously,\nexcept for the D2-brane [4]. In addition we characterize\ncompletely the global symmetries of these actions.\nAs it is well known the tension of a super-p-brane may\nbe generated dynamically as the flux of a world-volume\np-form gauge field [5]. Since D-branes are described by\nBorn-Infeld type actions it is natural to construct a manifestly S-dual IIB superstring by assembling the BornInfeld field and a tension generating gauge field into an\nSL(2) doublet [6]. The resulting theory is in a sense\ntwelve-dimensional. This is quite apparent in our formulation which uses actually a twelve-dimensional target space. The two \"extra dimensions\" get frozen: the\nvalues of their coordinates are integration constants by\nthe equations of motion. In the light of this interpretation in terms of extra dimensions, it is quite interesting\nthat the symmetries of the super-D-string action are not\nexhausted by the standard isometries of the \"ordinary\"\n(ten-dimensional) target space: rather, there can be additional symmetries which act nontrivially also on the coordinates of the extra dimensions. Our results may thus be\nof interest also in view of a possible twelve-dimensional\ntheory underlying IIB superstring theory [7]. Inspired\nby such considerations (and for the sake of generality)\nwe allow for an arbitrary number of gauge fields and\ncorresponding \"extra dimensions\", thereby including Dstrings but not restricting to them.\na. Field content and gauge symmetries. The results\nreported here were obtained by a BRST-cohomological\nanalysis whose details will be presented elsewhere. The\n\ninput of this analysis is the field content and a set of\ngauge transformations of the fields. The fields are those\nof the 2d supergravity multiplet {eam , \u03c7\u03b1\nm , S} (m, a, \u03b1\nare 2d world-sheet, Lorentz and spinor indices, respectively), an arbitrary number of \"matter multiplets\"\n{X M , \u03c8\u03b1M , F M } and an arbitrary number of gauge multiplets {Aim , \u03bbi\u03b1 , \u03c6i }. eam and \u03c7\u03b1\nm are the world-sheet\nzweibein and gravitino, respectively, the Aim are abelian\ngauge fields, and the X M may be regarded as coordinates\nof an enlarged target space. All fields, including the auxiliary fields are real (we use a Majorana-Weyl basis for\nthe \u03b3-matrices and the signature of the world-sheet metric is \u03b7ab = diag(1, \u22121); furthermore \u03b501 = \u03b510 = 1 and\n\u03b3\u2217 is defined through \u03b3 a \u03b3 b = \u03b7 ab 1l + \u03b5ab \u03b3\u2217 ; our formulae\napply with appropriate redefinitions also to Euclidean\nsignature). We impose the following gauge symmetries:\nworld-sheet diffeomorphisms, local (1,1) world-sheet supersymmetry, local 2d Lorentz invariance, invariance under abelian gauge transformations of the Aim , Weyl and\nsuper-Weyl invariance, and invariance under arbitrary local shifts of the field S.

It should be noted, however, that this uniqueness is tied to the gauge transformations (1) and may get lost when one allows that the\ngauge transformations get consistently deformed. E.g.,\none would expect that the world-sheet diffeomorphisms\nand supersymmetry transformations can be nontrivially\ndeformed such that the deformed action is invariant under the deformed transformations if the background has\nspecial isometries, by analogy with the purely bosonic\ncase [10]. Furthermore, there are certainly actions invariant under nonabelian gauge transformations of the\nAim (leading to nonabelian Born-Infeld actions, among\nothers). The general deformation problem is currently\nunder study.\nc. Simplified action. For further discussion we shall\nassume in the following that the functions Di coincide\nwith a subset of the fields X M .

A C without any index denotes the charge conjugation matrix. These gauge\ntransformations were obtained from an analysis of the 2d\nsupergravity algebra in presence of the matter and gauge\nmultiplets [8] (the analysis is analogous to the superspace\nanalysis in [9]). The corresponding BRST transformations of the ghosts are such that s2 = 0.\nb. Gauge invariant actions. Owing to the use of auxiliary fields, the algebra of the gauge transformations\ncloses off-shell. As a consequence, neither the BRST\ntransformations (1), nor the BRST transformations of\nthe ghosts contain antifields. This allows one to determine the action functionals which are invariant under the\ngauge transformations (1) by computing the cohomology\nof s in the space of antifield independent local functionals with ghost number 0. Our result of this computation\nis the following. The most general Lagrangian L which\ntransforms under the above gauge transformations into\na total derivative and which is polynomial in the derivatives of the fields is, modulo total derivatives,\n\n{X M } = {x\u03bc , y i },\n\nM\n\n+ 2i \u03c8 \u03b3 m \u2202m \u03c8 N GMN + 21 F M F N GMN\nM\n\n+\u03c7k \u03b3 n \u03b3 k (\u03c8 N \u2202n X M \u2212 41 C\u03c7n \u03c8 \u03c8 N )GMN\nN\n\n+( 21 F M \u03c8 \u03c8 N \u2212 i \u03c8 \u03b3 m \u03c8 M \u2202m X K )\u0393N KM\nK\n\nN\n\n+ 41 (F M \u03c8 \u03b3\u2217 \u03c8 N \u2212 i\u03c8 \u03b3 m \u03b3\u2217 \u03c8 M \u2202m X K )HN KM\nN\n\ni\n\u03c7m \u03b3 n \u03b3 m \u03c8 M \u03c8 \u03b3n \u03b3\u2217 \u03c8 K HMN K\n\u2212 12\nM\n\nK\n\n1\n\u03c8 (1l + \u03b3\u2217 )\u03c8 N \u03c8 (1l + \u03b3\u2217 )\u03c8 L RKMLN\n+ 16\nM\n\n+\u03b5mn Di \u2202m Ain + 4i \u03c8 \u03c8 N \u03c6i \u2202N \u2202M Di\nN\n\n+ 21 (i\u03c8 \u03b3\u2217 \u03bbi \u2212 iF N \u03c6i + \u03c7m \u03b3 m \u03c8 N \u03c6i )\u2202N Di ,\n\n(3)\n\nIn fact, this assumption is a very mild one because, except at stationary points of Di (X), (3) can be achieved\nby a field redefinition X M \u2192 X\u0303 M = X\u0303 M (X), where this\n\"coordinate transformation\" is such that each nonconstant Di (X) becomes one of the X\u0303's. Indeed, constant\nDi give only constributions to the Lagrangian which are\ntotal derivatives and can thus be neglected, at least classically; nonconstant Di can be assumed to be independent\nby a suitable choice of basis for the gauge fields and may\nthus be taken as X\u0303's, at least locally (e.g., if D1 = D2 , the\nLagrangian depends only on the combination A1m + A2m\nwhich can be introduced as a new gauge field).\nIt is now easy to see that the Lagrangian (2) can actually be simplified by setting the fields \u03c8 i , F i , \u03bbi , \u03c6i to\nzero. Indeed, owing to (3), the classical equations of\nmotion for \u03bbi and \u03c6i yield \u03c8 i = 0 and F i = 0. The\nlatter equations are algebraic and can be used in the Lagrangian. Then the Lagrangian does not contain \u03bbi and\n\u03c6i anymore and the only remnant of the gauge multiplets are the terms e\u03b5mn y i \u2202m Ain . This reflects that the\ngauge multiplets carry no dynamical degrees of freedom\n\nL/e = 12 \u2202m X M \u2202n X N (\u2212hmn GMN + \u03b5mn BMN )\n\nK\n\nDi = y i .\n\n(2)\n\nwhere e = det(eam ), and hmn is the world-sheet metric\nbuilt from eam . GMN , BMN and Di are arbitrary functions of the X M , except that GMN and BMN are symmetric and antisymmetric in M and N , respectively, and\n\u0393MN K , HMN K and RMN KL are given by\n2\n\n\f\u2206Aim = biM (X)\u2202m X M + aiM (X)\u03b5m n \u2202n X M\n\nsince the world-sheet is 2-dimensional. Of course, the\ntransformations (1) must be adapted in order to provide the gauge symmetries of the simplified Lagrangian:\nthose fields that are eliminated from the action must also\nbe eliminated from the transformations of the remaining\nfields using the equations of motion of the eliminated\nfields. This only affects the supersymmetry transformations of y i and Aim . The new supersymmetry transformation of y i is then simply zero. This is not in contradiction\nwith the supersymmetry algebra because the equations\nof motion for the Aim give \u2202m y i = 0 (of course, after\neliminating the fields \u03c8 i , F i , \u03bbi , \u03c6i , the supersymmetry\nalgebra holds only on-shell). The y i are thus constant\non-shell, their values being integration constants fixed\nonly by initial conditions. This leads to the interpretation of the y i as coordinates of \"frozen extra dimensions\"\nmentioned in the beginning.\nd.\nBorn-Infeld actions. Locally supersymmetric\nBorn-Infeld actions arise from (2) for particular choices\nof GMN and BMN , in complete analogy to the purely\nbosonic case [12]. For instance, consider the case with\nonly one gauge field ({Aim } = {Am }, {y i } = {y}) and\nthe following particular choice of GMN and BMN ,\np\nG\u03bc\u03bd = 1 + y 2 g\u03bc\u03bd (x), B\u03bc\u03bd = y b\u03bc\u03bd (x)\nGyy = Gy\u03bc = By\u03bc = 0.\n(4)\n\n\u2212\u03b4jk Ajm \u2202i K k (y) \u2212 \u03c7n \u03b3m \u03b3 n \u03b3\u2217 \u03c8 \u03bc ai\u03bc (X)\n\u03bc\n\n+ 2i \u03c8 \u03b3m {\u03b3\u2217 \u03c8 \u03bd \u2202[\u03bd ai\u03bc] (X) \u2212 \u03c8 \u03bd \u2202[\u03bd bi\u03bc] (X)}\n\nwhere HM , aiM and biM have to solve the following generalized Killing vector equations,\nLH GMN = \u22122\u03b4i(M aNi ) ,\nLH BMN = \u22122\u2202[M pN ] + 2\u03b4i[M bNi ]\n\nFmn\n\nLV G\u03bc\u03bd = 0,\n\n(8)\n\n(LV + K i \u2202i )G\u03bc\u03bd = 0, (LV + K i \u2202i )B\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122\u2202[\u03bc p\u03bd] , (9)\nwhere LV is the Lie derivative along the vector field V M\ngiven by V i = 0, V \u03bc = V \u03bc (X). The remaining equations\n(7) just determine the functions aiM and biM ,\n\n(5)\n\nai\u03bc = \u2212LH G\u03bci ,\n\naji = \u2212 21 LH Gij\n\nbi\u03bc = \u2212LH B\u03bci + \u2202i p\u03bc ,\n\nbji = \u2212 21 LH Bij .\n\n(10)\n\nHere we have used that pi and the parts of aji resp. bji\nwhich are antisymmetric resp. symmetric in i, j can be\nset to zero without loss of generality (the corresponding\ncontributions to \u2206 can be removed by subtracting trivial\nglobal symmetries from \u2206).\nThe global symmetries are thus completely determined\nby equations (9). Note that these equations reproduce (8)\nfor K i = 0, except that now G\u03bc\u03bd and B\u03bc\u03bd depend in general not only on the x\u03bc but also on the y i . Hence, in general V \u03bc and p\u03bc also depend on the y i . For the discussion\nof equations (9), the y i may be viewed as parameters of\nG\u03bc\u03bd and B\u03bc\u03bd rather than as coordinates of extra dimensions. Solutions to equations (9) with K i = 0 can thus\nbe regarded as solutions to equations (8) for parameterdependent G\u03bc\u03bd and B\u03bc\u03bd . In contrast, solutions to (9)\nwith K i 6= 0 have no counterparts among the solutions\n\n\u2206\u03c7\u03b1\nm = 0\n\n\u2206X M = HM , Hi = K i (y),\n\u2206\u03c8\u03b1\u03bc = \u03c8\u03b1\u03bd \u2202\u03bd V \u03bc (X)\n\nLV B\u03bc\u03bd = \u22122\u2202[\u03bc p\u03bd] .\n\nThese equations had been already discussed in [14]. The\nfirst equation (8) is just the standard Killing vector equation for G\u03bc\u03bd . Hence, the solutions of equations (8) are\nthose Killing vector fields of G\u03bc\u03bd which solve the second\nequation (8) (for some p\u03bc ).\nThe situation changes when gauge fields are present.\nThen equations (7) read for M, N = \u03bc, \u03bd:\n\nwhere we have assumed det(gmn ) < 0 and det(gmn +\nFmn ) < 0, and the nonwritten terms involve fermions.\nThe Born-Infeld Lagrangian L = \u00b1[+ det(gmn +\nFmn )]1/2 + . . . for Euclidean signature (det(gmn ) > 0)\ncorresponds to G\u03bc\u03bd = (1 \u2212 y 2 )1/2 g\u03bc\u03bd (x).\ne. Global symmetries. Our second result concerns the\nglobal symmetries of the action (2). These can be obtained from the BRST cohomology in the space of antifield dependent local functionals with ghost number \u22121\n[13]. We have computed this cohomology completely and\npresent now the resulting global symmetries for the simplified form of the action described above (without the\nfields \u03c8 i , F i , \u03bbi , \u03c6i and assuming (3)). The nontrivial\nglobal symmetries (a global symmetry is called trivial\nwhen it is equal to a gauge transformation on-shell) are\ngenerated by the following transformations,\n\u2206ema = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nfor some functions pM (X) (LH is the Lie derivative along\nHM and \u03b4iM is the Kronecker symbol). Note that the pM\ndo not occur in the \u2206-transformations; however, they do\ncontribute to the corresponding Noether currents.\nThe equations (7) are actually the same as the equations which also determine the symmetries of bosonic\nstring and D-string actions [11,12] with the specification (3). In the absence of gauge fields (no Aim , y i , K i ;\n{HM } \u2261 {V \u03bc }), they read\n\ny can be eliminated algebraically. Eliminating also the\nworld-sheet zweibein eam , the Lagrangian becomes\np\nL = \u00b1 \u2212 det(gmn + Fmn ) + . . .\ngmn = g\u03bc\u03bd (x)\u2202m x\u03bc \u2202n x\u03bd\n= \u2202m An \u2212 \u2202n Am \u2212 b\u03bc\u03bd (x)\u2202m x\u03bc \u2202n x\u03bd\n\n(6)\n\nH\u03bc = V \u03bc (X)\n\n\u03bd\n\n\u2206F \u03bc = F \u03bd \u2202\u03bd V \u03bc (X) + 12 \u03c8 \u03c8 \u03bb \u2202\u03bd \u2202\u03bb V \u03bc (X)\n3\n\n\fbecause of \u2206y = 2r(y) and is intimately related to property (iii) because the field strength is related to y by\nf \u2032 (y) \u2248 \u03b5mn \u2202m An + . . . where \u2248 is equality on-shell.\nWe stress that the presence of the dilatations is not an\nartefact of our formulation. Rather, they are of course\npresent even after elimination of y. Finally we note that\nproperties (ii) and (iii) extend to more complicated backgrounds for which solutions to (9) with K i 6= 0 exist.\ng.\nAcknowledgements.

Such solutions may be called \"dilatational\" solutions, because in special cases they are true dilatations,\nas we will see in the example below (further examples\ncan be found in [12]).\nFinally we note that the solutions to equations (9)\ncome in infinitely big families and that, as a consequence,\nthe corresponding commutator algebra of the global symmetries is an infinite dimensional loop-like algebra. This\nhas been observed already in [12] and is a consequence of\nthe fact that the action depends on the Aim only via their\nfield strengths [15]. All members of a family of solutions\narise from one solution V \u03bc (X), K i (y), p\u03bc (X) by multiplying that solution with arbitrary functions of the y i .\nAs the y i are constant on-shell, this infinite dimensionality of the space of global symmetries has no practical\nimportance, i.e., in order to discuss the global symmetries it is sufficient to consider just one representative of\neach family.\nf.
