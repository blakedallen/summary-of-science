At small\nmomenta (soft region) one of the most popular and successful models is the colour string model.\nIn its original formulation it assumes that in a collision a certain number of colour strings of\ndefinite length in rapidity are stretched between the colliding partons, which then independently\ndecay into observed secondaries [1, 2]. The colour string is visualized as a strong colour field\nwhich is succesively broken by creation of quark-antiquark pairs. A more refined version takes\ninto account not only a finite length in rapidity but also a finite transverse dimension of the\nstring. This inevitably leads to the phenomenon of string fusion and percolation [3, 4, 5].\nThe colour string model with fusion and percolation describes quite satisfactorily multiparticle\nproduction in the soft region. In particular, it predicts that, due to fusion, mutiplicities become\nsubstancially damped, as compared to the independent string picture. The damping factor F\nmay be related to the so-called percolation parameter\n\u03b7=\n\nN \u03c30\n,\nS\n1\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nwhere \u03c30 is the transverse area of the string and N is the number of strings in the interaction\narea S. As a function of \u03b7 one finds for the damping factor [5]\nF (\u03b7) =\n\ns\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b7\n,\n\u03b7\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\nso that at large \u03b7 multiplicities are damped by 1/ \u03b7.\nWith all this, the colour string model remains mostly phenomenological, although at the\nbasis of it there lie certain ideas borrowed both from the old Regge phenomenology and QCD in\nthe limit of large number of colours (see [1]). Less phenomenological approaches can naturally\nbe developed in the hard region where the secondaries are assumed to have large transverse\nmomenta. The well known hard scattering picture has been successfully applied to production\nof heavy flavour and high-mass Drell-Yan pairs. However this approach is valid only in the\nkinematical region appropriate for the DGLAP evolution, for values of x of the order unity,\nand the following ordering in transverse momenta. The region of small x can be reached via\nthe evolution according to the BFKL equation and its generalization for nuclei. Both hard\napproaches suffer from serious drawbacks. The DGLAP evolution cannot be generalized to\nseveral hard collisions in a convincing manner, since this involves multiparton distributions\ncorresponding to higher twists. The BFKL approach does not take into account the running of\nthe coupling. It also involves small transverse momenta, where it cannot be valid, and violates\nunitarity for hadronic scattering. In this respect the situation is better for scattering off nuclei,\nwhere the small transverse momentum region is strongly damped and unitarity is automatically\nfulfilled [6, 7]. In spite of these difficulties hard approaches give predictions which are compatible\nwith the experimental data.\nIn view of this split between soft and hard regions it is of certain interest to find a bridge\nbetween them. In particular it has long been suspected that damping of multiplicities predicted\nby colour string fusion has its obvious counterpart in the hard region in the form of pomeron\nfusion due to pomeron interaction. Note that a literal comparison between the two approaches is\nhardly possible. In the colour string picture fusion leads to appearance of parts of the transverse\nspace with a larger colour field strength (\"strings of higher colour\"). As a result, damping of\nmultiplicities is accompanied by the rise of the average transverse momentum. In the pomeron\npicture, at least in the high colour limit, fusion of pomerons does not lead to new objects. Only\nthe average number of pomerons may become reduced, and the multiplicities with them. But one\ndoes not naively expect any change in the transverse momentum. As we shall see in the following\nsections, this is fully confirmed in the simple old-fashioned local supercritical pomeron model, in\nwhich also damping of the multiplicities is found to be much stronger than predicted by the colour\nstring models with fusion. The new result reported in this paper is that the perturbative QCD\nhard pomeron approach leads to multiparticle production which qualitatively fully agrees with\nthe colour string approach with fusion. Not only damping of the multiplicities turns out to be\nof the same strength as in the string picture, but also the average transverse momenta are found\nto rise nearly as predicted by the latter model. So we find an agreement between predictions\nof these two models, pertaining to completely different (in fact opposite) kinematical regions\nof secondaries, about certain basic features of multiparticle spectra. These results are not fully\nunexpected. Indeed similar predictions were found previously [8] in the framework of colour\nglass condensate [9]. Also in all considered approaches scaling in the transverse momentum\ndistribution was observed [8, 10, 11]. We consider this as a strong support for these predictions\nand thereby for the models.\n\n\f3\n\n2\n\nGeneralities. Fusing colour string predictions\n\nOur basic quantity will be the inclusive cross-section IAB (y, k) to produce a particle with the\ntransverse momentum k at rapidity y in a collision of two nuclei with atomic numbers A and B:\nIAB (y, k) =\n\n(2\u03c0)2 d\u03c3\n.\ndyd2 k\n\n(3)\n\nIt can be represented as an integral over the impact parameter b:\nIAB (y, k) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 bIAB (y, k, b).\n\n(4)\n\nTo simplify our study we shall concentrate on the inclusive cross-section at fixed impact parameter b. We shall also limit ourselves to collision of identical nuclei A = B and for brevity denote\nIAA \u2261 IA and so on. The corresponding multiplicity at fixed rapidity y will be given by\n\u03bctot\nA (y, b) =\n\n1\n\u03c3A (b)\n\nd2 k\nIA (y, k, b),\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c3A (b) is the total inelastic cross-section for the collision of two identical nuclei at fixed\nimpact parameter b. To study the effect of string fusion we shall be interested in the multiplicity\nper string \u03bcA (y, b), given by the ratio of (5) to the number of strings \u03bdA (b) at impact parameter\nb\n\u03bctot (y, b)\n.\n(6)\n\u03bcA (y, b) = A\n\u03bdA (b)\nThe latter can be determined by the number of inelastic NN collisions times the number of\nstrings in a single NN collision \u03bdN . For identical nuclei we find\n\u03bdA (b) =\n\nA2 \u03c3N TAA (b)\n\u03bdN\n\u03c3A (b)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere TAA (b) is the nuclear transverse density in the overlap area:\nTAA (b) =\n\nZ\n\nd2 cTA (c)TA (b \u2212 c),\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3N is the NN total cross-section and TA (b) is the standard nuclear profile function for a single\nnucleus A normalized to unity. In the ratio (6) the total nucleus-nucleus cross-section \u03c3A (b)\ncancels;\nR 2\n(d k/(2\u03c0)2 )IA (y, k, b)\n.\n(9)\n\u03bcA (b) =\nA2 TAA (b)\u03c3N \u03bdN\nThis point is very important, since it means that we shall have to calculate only the inclusive\ncross-sections for the collision of two nuclei but not the total cross-sections , which is a problem\nof incomparably more complexity.\nTo simplify the problem still further, we shall consider the simplest choice of constant profile\nfunction TA (b) inside a circle of nuclear radius RA = A1/3 R0 . Then also the inclusive crosssection will be independent of b inside the overlap area. We choose b = 0 (central collision)\nwhen the overlap area coincides with the nuclear transverse area to find from (9)\n\u03bcA = A\u22124/3\n\n\u03c0R02\n\u03c3N \u03bd N\n\nZ\n\nd2 k\nIA (y, k).\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(10)\n\nParallel to this we shall study the average transverse momentum squared, defined by\nd2 kk2 IA (y, k)\n< k >A = R 2\n.\nd kIA (y, k)\n2\n\nR\n\n(11)\n\n\f4\nHere b = 0 is implied. Equations (10) and (11) will be our basic tools in ther following.\nWe start with the fusing colour strings picture. In it the strength of fusion is determined by\nthe percolation parameter (1). For central collisions it is given by\n\u03b7A = A2/3\n\n2\n\u03c3N\n\u03b7N ,\n\u03c0 2 R04 \u03c3A (b = 0)\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b7N is the value of the parameter for N N collisions at the same energy. Note that the\nvalue of \u03b7 depends on the total inelastic nuclear cross-section for central collisions. We take it\nin the optical approximation as\n\u03c3A (b = 0) = 1 \u2212 e\u2212A\n\n4/3 \u03c3 /(\u03c0R2 )\nN\n0\n\n.\n\n(13)\n\nAs stated in the Introduction, the fusing string picture predicts that multiplicities are damped\nby the factor (2):\n\u03bcA = \u03bc0 F (\u03b7A )\n(14)\nwhere \u03bc0 is the multiplicity corresponding to a single string. From this we find\n\u03bcA\n=\n\u03bc1\n\nr\n\n\u03b71\n\u03b7A\n\ns\n\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b7A\n.\n1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b71\n\n(15)\n\nThis relation describes the A-dependence of the multiplicity. It does not involve the unknown\nstring multiplicity \u03bc0 . At high string densities and consequently large \u03b7's it obviously predicts\ndamping of multiplicities according to\n1\n\u221d A\u22121/3 .\n\u03bcAA \u221d \u221a\n\u03b7A\n\n(16)\n\nNote that, as a result of fusion, the total multiplicity from being proportional to a number of\ninelastic collisions, \u221d A4/3 , reduces to become proportional to the number of participants \u221d A.\nIt also follows from the fusing string picture that < k2 >A behaves inversely to multiplicity.\nIt grows with \u03b7:\n1\n,\n(17)\n< k2 >A =< k2 >0\nF (\u03b7A )\nso that the product \u03bcA < k2 >A does not change with fusion of strings.\n\n3\n\nOld-fashioned local supercritical pomeron\n\nIn this section we shall compare predictions about the average multiplicity and transverse momentum which follow from the colour string model with those from the old supercritical local\npomeron model. This will serve as a benchmark for the study in the next section of analogous\npredictions following from the non-local perturbative QCD pomeron.\nAs shown in [12], if the nucleus-nucleus interaction is governed by the exchange of pomerons\nwith the triple pomeron interactions, the inclusive cross-sections are given by the convolution of\ntwo sets of fan diagrams connecting the emitted particle to the two nuclei times the vertex for\nthe emission (Fig. 1). Explicitly, at a given impact parameter b\nIAB (y, k, b) = f (k)\n\nZ\n\nd2 c\u03a6B (Y \u2212 y, b \u2212 c)\u03a6A (y, c),\n\n(18)\n\nwhere f (k) is the emission vertex, \u03a6A,B 's are sums of fan diagrams connected to nuclei A and B\nand it is assumed that nucleus A is at rest and the incident nucleus B is at the overall rapidity\nY.\n\n\f5\nThe form (18) characteristic for the old-fashioned local Regge-Gribov theory immediately\ntells us that the average transverse momentum does not depend on A or B and so does not\nfeel fusion of pomerons at all. It obviously follows from the fact that independent of A or B\nthe observed particle is emitted from the same single pomeron. Therefore predictions of the\nold local pomeron theory for the transverse momentum dependence do not agree with those\nfrom the fusing colour string model. They rather correspond to models without fusion, in which\nindeed < k 2 > does not depend on the string density.\nPassing to the multiplicities we use the well-known solution for the fans [13]. Taking A = B\nand constant nuclear profile functions we have for |b| < RA\n\u03a6A (y) = A1/3\n\ne\u2206y\ng\n,\nR02 1 + A1/3 R\u03bb2 \u2206 (e\u2206y \u2212 1)\n\n(19)\n\n0\n\nwhere \u2206 is the pomeron intercept minus one, \u03bb (positive) is the triple pomeron coupling with a\nminus sign and g is the pomeron nucleon coupling. Taking y = Y /2 (central rapidity) we find\nthe inclusive cross-section defined in the previous section as\n2/3\n\nIA (y, k) = A\n\nh\n\n\u03c0R02 f (k)\n\n\u03a6A\n\n\u0012\n\nY\n2\n\n\u0013i\n\n2\n\n(20)\n\nThe A-dependence of this inclusive cross-section obviously depends on the energy. At small\nenergies one may neglect the second term in the denominator of (19), which actually means\nthat one neglects all non- linear effects. Then JA \u221d A4/3 and from (10) one concludes that\nthe multplicity per string does not depend on A, as expected. At large enough Y when one\ncan retain only the exponential term in the denominator of (19) the inclusive cross-section IA\nbecomes proportional to A2/3 . Then according to (10) the multiplicity per string will fall with\nA as 1/A2/3 , much faster than predicted by the colour string scenario.\nSo in the end we see that the old-fashioned phenomenological local pomeron model leads to\npredictions which do not agree with those from the fusing colour string model. The multiplicities\nfall too fast at high values of A and the average transverse momentum does not grow at all. It\nis remarkable that this situation radically changes with the perturbative QCD pomeron.\n\n4\n\nPerturbative QCD pomeron\n\nThe fundamental change introduced by the perturbative QCD approach is that the pomeron\nbecomes non-local. Its propagation is now governed by the BFKL equation (see [14] for a\nreview). Its interaction is realized by the triple pomeron vertex, which is also non-local [15, 16].\nEquations which describe nucleus-nucleus interaction in the perturbative QCD framework have\nbeen obtained in [17]. They are quite complicated and difficult to solve (see [19] for a partial\nsolution), but they will be not needed for our purpose. Knowing that the AGK rules are satisfied\nfor the diagrams with BFKL pomerons interacting via the triple pomeron vertex [16] and using\narguments of [12] it is easy to conclude that, as with the old local pomerons, the inclusive\ncross-section will again be given by the convolution of two sums of fan diagrams propagating\nfrom the emitted particle towards the two nuclei. The fundamental difference will be that the\ntransverse momentum dependence will not be factorized as in (18) but depend non-trivially on\nthe momenta inside the two non-local fans.\nTaking again A = B and constant nuclear density for |b| < RA we find the inclusive crosssection in the perturbative QCD as [20]\nIA (y, k) = A2/3 \u03c0R02\n\n8Nc \u03b1s\nk2\n\nZ\n\nd2 reikr [\u2206\u03a6A (Y \u2212 y, r)][\u2206\u03a6A (y, r)],\n\n(21)\n\n\f6\nwhere \u2206 is the two-dimensional Laplacian and \u03a6(y, r) is the sum of all fan diagrams connecting\nthe pomeron at rapidity y and of the transverse dimension r with the colliding nuclei, one at\nrest and the other at rapidity Y . Function \u03c6A (y, r) = \u03a6(y, r)/(2\u03c0r 2 ), in the momentum space,\nsatisfies the well-known non-linear equation [6, 7, 18]\n\u2202\u03c6(y, q)\n= \u2212H\u03c6(y, q) \u2212 \u03c62 (y, q),\n\u2202 \u0233\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u0233 = \u1fb1y, \u1fb1 = \u03b1s Nc /\u03c0, \u03b1s and Nc are the strong coupling constant and the number of\ncolours, respectively, and H is the BFKL Hamiltonian. Eq. (22) has to be solved with the initial\ncondition at y = 0 determined by the colour dipole distribution in the nucleon smeared by the\nprofile function of the nucleus.\nIn our study we have taken the initial condition in accordance with the Golec-Biernat distribution [21], duly generalized for the nucleus:\nq2\n1\n\u03c6(0, q) = \u2212 a Ei \u2212\n2\n0.3567 GeV 2\nwith\na = A1/3\n\n!\n\n,\n\n20.8 mb\n.\n\u03c0R02\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\nEvolving \u03c6(y, q) up to values \u0233 = 3 we found the inclusive cross-section (21) at center rapidity\nfor energies corresponding to the overall rapidity Y = \u0232 /\u1fb1. with \u0232 = 6. Taking \u03b1s = 0.2 this\ngives Y \u223c 31, which is far beyond the present possibilities. The overall cutoffs for integration\nmomenta in Eq.(22) were taken according to 0.3.10\u22128 GeV/c < q < 0.3.10+16 GeV/c.\nThe found inclusive cross-sections are illustrated in Figs 2-6. To see how the form of the\ndistribution changes with energy, we present in Fig. 2 the distributions for A = 1 and y = Y /2\nnormalized to unity and multiplied by k2 to exclude the trivial 1/k 2 dependence present in (21),\nJ1 (y, k) = k2 I1 (y, k)/\n\nZ\n\nd2 k\nI1 (y, k)\n(2\u03c0)2\n\n(25)\n\nat different energies corresponding to \u0232 = 1, 3, 6. One observes how, with the growth of energy,\nthe distributions are shifted towards higher values of k.\nIn Figs. 3-6 we illustrate the A-dependence showing ratios\ncol\nRA\n=\n\nIA (y, k)\nA4/3 I1 (y, k)\n\n(26)\n\nIA (y, k)\nAI1 (y, k)\n\n(27)\n\nand\npart\nRA\n=\n\nwith inclusive cross-sections scaled by the number of collisions, \u221d A4/3 , or by the number of\nparticipants \u221d A, at y = Y /2 and Y = 1, 3 and 6. One clearly sees that whereas at relatively small\nmomenta the inclusive cross-sections are proprtional to A, that is to the number of participants,\nat larger momenta they grow with A faster, however noticeably slowlier than the number of\ncollisions, approximately as A1.1 . The interval of momenta for which IA \u221d A is growing with\nenergy, so that one may conjecture that at infinite energies all the spectrum will be proportional\nto A.\nPassing to the determination of both multiplicities and average transverse momenta one\nhas to observe certain care because of the properties of the perturbative QCD solution in the\nleading approximation embodied in Eq. (22). As follows from (21) the inclusive cross-section\n\n\f7\nblows up at k2 \u2192 0 independent of the rapidity y. So the corresponding total multiplicity\ndiverges logarithmically. However, the physical sense has only emission of jets with high enough\ntransverse momenta. Thus we restricted ourselves to produced jets with k > kmin . For kmin we\nchose two possibilities: kmin = 0.3 and 1.0 GeV/c. Our conclusions turned out to be practically\nindependent of this choice. In the following we discuss the results with kmin = 0.3 GeV/c. As to\nthe average transverse momentum, the calculated \u03c6(y, q) fall very slowly with q, so that < k2 >\nclearly diverges. Even the calculation of < |k| >, which converges, encounters certain difficulties\nat highest Y due to reduced precision and influence of overall cutoffs. So we found our values\nof average k2 squared as < |k| >2 .\nDue to unreasonably high value of the BFKL intercept \u2206 = \u1fb1 4 ln 2, both the multiplicities\nand average transverse momenta grow very fast with Y and reach unreasonably high values\n\u03bc \u223c 106 and < |k| >\u223c 104 GeV/c at \u0232 = 6. However we are not interested in the Y dependence\nbut rather in the A-dependence, since in the fusing string scenario the energy dependence is\nintroduced on the phenomenological grounds.\nTo a very good precision, at high energies corresponding to scaled rapidities \u0232 > 2 the total\nmultiplicities are found to be proportional to A, that is to the number of participants.\nTo compare with the string scenario we turn to multiplicities per string \u03bcA . In Tables 1 and\n2 the ratios\n\u0012\n\u0013\n< |k| >A 2\n\u03bcA\n, rk (A) =\n(28)\nr\u03bc (A) =\n\u03bc1\n< |k| >1\nat given overall scaled rapidities \u0232 = 1, ...6 . Table 3 shows the product r\u03bc rk which is unity in\nthe fusion strings model. These results were obtained with the low kmin .\n\nTable 1: Ratios r\u03bc (A) =\n\n\u03bcA\n\u03bc1\n\nA\n\n\u0232 =1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n27\n64\n125\n216\n\n0.695\n0.531\n0.429\n0.358\n0.306\n\n0.611\n0.439\n0.341\n0.278\n0.233\n\n0.585\n0.412\n0.317\n0.256\n0.214\n\n0.572\n0.400\n0.306\n0.246\n0.205\n\n0.565\n0.392\n0.299\n0.240\n0.200\n\n0.560\n0.387\n0.294\n0.236\n0.196\n\nAlready a superficial study of these results shows their striking similarity with the predictions\nbased on the fusing string picture. In particular the products r\u03bc (A)rk (A) result nearly universal\nand close to the value unity predicted by the latter. A certain drop of this product towards\nhigher A and \u0232 may to be related to the neglected far tail of the momentum distribution at\nsuper-high values of k, which is absolutely irrelevant for the multiplicity but can give some\ncontribution to < |k| >.\nA more detailed comparison can be performed using Eq. (15) derived from the string picture.\nWe fitted the better known ratios r\u03bc (A) according to this equation using \u03b71 as an adjustable\nparameter and taking for \u03c3N (s) the experimental data well-reproduced by\n\u03c3N = 38.3 + 0.545 ln2\n\n\u0012\n\ns\n122 GeV 2\n\n\u0013\n\n(29)\n\nThe values of \u03b71 which give the best least-square fit at overall scaled rapidities \u0232 = 1, 2, ...6 are\n\n\f8\n\nTable 2: Ratios rk (A) =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n<|k|>A 2\n<|k|>1\n\nA\n\n\u0232 =1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n27\n64\n125\n216\n\n1.305\n1.559\n1.810\n2.025\n2.226\n\n1.606\n2.123\n2.643\n3.117\n3.575\n\n1.718\n2.336\n2.922\n3.508\n4.010\n\n1.745\n2.378\n3.001\n3.568\n4.070\n\n1.713\n2.310\n2.839\n3.319\n3.761\n\n1.651\n2.214\n2.685\n3.105\n3.488\n\nTable 3: Products r\u03bc (A)rk (A)\nA\n\n\u0232 =1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n8\n27\n64\n125\n216\n\n0.907\n0.828\n0.776\n0.725\n0.681\n\n0.982\n0.933\n0.902\n0.866\n0.834\n\n1.004\n0.963\n0.926\n0.898\n0.858\n\n0.998\n0.950\n0.917\n0.878\n0.834\n\n0.967\n0.906\n0.848\n0.797\n0.751\n\n0.924\n0.857\n0.790\n0.732\n0.684\n\nrespectively\n\u03b71 = 0.267, 0.678, 0.931, 1.201, 1.348, 1.433\nWith these \u03b71 's we reproduce the data for r\u03bc (A) from Table 1 by Eq. (15) with the average\nrelative error which goes from the maximal 2.8% at \u0232 = 1 down to minimal 0.98% at \u0232 = 6.\nUsing the adjusted value of \u03b71 at \u0232 = 1 and assuming that at this comparatively low energy the\nnumber of strings in the N N collision is exactly 2, we could determine the effective string radius\ncorresponding to the pomeron picture to be r0 = 0.32 fm. This value is astonishingly close to\nstandard values used in the fusing string calculations. If we assume that this string radius is\nfixed independent of energy then we can find the effective average number of strings in a NN\ncollision at higher energies. We find at \u0232 = 2, 3, ...6 respectively\n\u03bdN = 3.72, 4.31, 3.71, 2.81, 2.11\nIt is interesting that at accessible energies (up to \u0232 = 3) the number of strings monotonously\ngrows in accordance with the standard expectations, although noticeably slowlier. This may\nbe interpreted as a signal of string fusion already in NN collisions. At still higher energies this\nphenomenon seems to become much stronger so that the effective average of strings begins to\nfall.\nSo to conclude the predictions from the perturbative QCD pomeron approach seem to fully\nagree with those from the fusing string picture.\n\n\f9\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nWe have compared predictions for multiplicities and average transverse momentum which follow\nfrom the semi-phenomenological fusing colour string picture for the soft domain with those\nwhich follow from the pomeron approach, both phenomenological and perturbatively derived\nfrom QCD.\nThe old-fashioned pomeron approach with triple pomeron interaction leads to results which\ndisagree with the colour string models both with or without fusion. The average transverse\nmomentum in this approach is independent of A, contrary to predictions of the colour model\nwith fusion. On the other hand, the multiplicity per string falls with A, in contradiction with\nthe predictions of the models without fusion. In fact the only way to reconciliate the two models\nis to assume the eikonal form for the multiple pomeron exchange without the triple pomeron\ninteraction. Such a model gives prediction equivalent to the independent string picture (without\nfusion). In fact this is the dynamics tacitly assumed in the original form of the string model\n[1, 2]\nThe perturbative QCD pomeron gives results which are in remarkable agreement with the\nstring model with fusion. The behaviour of the multiplicities and average transverse momentum\nare in good agreement not only qualitatively but also quantitatively. Moreover the effective\nstring radius extracted from these results turns out to be in agreement with the standardly\nassumed value in fusing colour string calculations. This overall agreement may appear to be\nastonishing in view of very different dynamical pictures put in the basis of the two approaches\nand also quite different domains of their applicability: soft for the string picture and hard for\nthe pomeron picture. However, on second thought, one may come to the conclusion that the\ndymanical difference between the two approaches is not so unbridgeable. Two phenomenons\nare playing the leading role in both approaches. One is fusion of exchanged elemental objects,\nstrings in one picture and pomerons in the other. This explains damping of multiplicities per\none initial elemental object. Second phenomenon is the rise of average transverse momentum\nwith this fusion. It is generated by formation of strings of higher tension (colour) in the string\nscenario. In the pomeron model this rise occurs due the growth of the so-called saturation\nmomentum, which shifts the momentum distribution to higher momenta with A (and Y ). Due\nto this shift non-linear effects in Eq. (22) in some sense reproduce formation of strings of higher\ncolour in the string model.\nThe discovered similarity in predictions between the perturbative QCD pomeron and fusing\nstring model indicates that the dynamics of strong interaction does not radically change when\npassing from the soft to very hard region, in spite of the change in its microscopic content, from\nstrings to partons. It also leaves certain hopes that these predictions are well founded in spite\nof all known limitations in validity and applicability of these models.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors are deeply indebted to N.Armesto for a constructive discussion and valuable comments.
