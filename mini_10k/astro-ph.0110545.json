Two different spatially flat cosmological models have been considered: a low-density cold\ndark matter universe with a vacuum energy density \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 (\u039bCDM) and a\ncold+hot dark matter model (CHDM). For each of these models two different\nclusters have been extracted from a cosmological N\u2212body simulation. A series\nof hydrodynamical simulations has then been performed for each of them using a\nTREESPH code. These simulations first include radiative cooling and then also\nconversion of cold gas particles into stars; because of supernova explosions these\nparticles can release energy in the form of thermal energy to the surrounding\nintracluster gas. For a specific treatment for the thermal state of the gas, simulation runs have been performed with different numerical resolutions. This is in\norder to disentangle in the final results for the cluster profiles, the effects of the\nresolution from those due to the assumed model for the gas thermal evolution.\nThe numerical resolution of the simulation is controlled by the number of gas particles Ng and the chosen value for the gas gravitational softening parameter \u03b5g .\nThe latter is proportional to the minimum SPH smoothing length and therefore\nsets a maximum spatial resolution for the simulations. For the cooling runs, final\nX-ray luminosities have been found to be diverging according to LX \u221d 1/\u03b5\u223c5\ng .\nThe gas density profiles are also diverging at the cluster center. This is in agreement with previous findings. When cold gas particles are allowed to convert into\nstars, the divergences are removed. The final gas profiles show a well defined\ncore radius and the temperature profiles are nearly flat. For the most massive\ntest cluster in the \u039bCDM model, these simulations show a prominent cooling\nflow in the cluster core. This cluster was analyzed in detail, running simulations\nwith different star formation methods and increasing numerical resolution. A\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\ncomparison between different runs shows that the results of simulations, based\non star formation methods in which gas conversion into stars is controlled by\nan efficiency parameter c\u22c6 , are sensitive to the numerical resolution of the simulation. In this respect star formation methods based instead on a local density\nthreshold, as in Navarro and White (1993), are shown to give more stable results.\nFinal X-ray luminosities are found to be numerically stable, with uncertainties\nof a factor \u223c 2. These simulations are also in good agreement with observational\ndata when the final results are compared with the observed star formation rate\nand the luminosity-temperature relation from cooling flow clusters. Therefore I\nfind that hydrodynamical simulations of cooling clusters can be used to give reliably predictions of the cluster X-ray properties. For a given numerical resolution,\nthe conversion of cool gas particles into stars as in Navarro and White should be\npreferred.\nSubject headings: cosmology: clusters\u2013galaxies:clusters\u2013methods:numerical\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nGalaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures known in the universe. According\nto the hierarchical scenario their evolution rate is a strong function of the background cosmology (Peebles, Daly & Juszkiewicz 1989; Lilje 1992; Viana & Liddle 1999; Oukbir &\nBlanchard 1992; Eke et al. 1998; Sadat, Blanchard & Oukbir 1998; Bahcall, Fan & Cen\n1997), thus making galaxy clusters natural tools for constraining the cosmological models.\nGalaxy clusters are also powerful X-ray emitters. X-ray observations have shown that most\nof the baryons in galaxy clusters are in the form of hot ( T \u2243 107 \u25e6K ) ionized X-ray emitting gas (Forman & Jones 1982; Sarazin 1986). The bulk of the emission is via thermal\nbremsstrahlung; its dependence on the square of the gas density allows one to select cluster\nsamples without the contamination effects which may arise in the optical band. For this\nreason, galaxy clusters have been the subject of extensive observational programs in the\nX-ray band (Henry et al. 1992; Henry 1997; Ebeling et al. 1997; Rosati et al. 1998).\nObservations of the cluster X-ray emission and temperature can be used to reconstruct the\nradial gas density and temperature profile, assuming spherical symmetry. The gas density\nprofile has a radial fall-off with slope \u2243 \u22122 and a constant density core in the inner regions,\nwith typical size rg \u2243 50 \u2212 200h\u22121 Kpc (Sarazin 1986); the gas temperature profile is instead\nnearly isothermal within the virial radius. The density of the gas can be used to recover\nthe dark matter profile and the total cluster mass. Assuming virial equilibrium these cluster properties are connected to the primeval power spectrum and the assumed cosmological\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nmodel, thus providing important clues for testing cosmologies (Makino, Sasaki & Suto 1998;\nNavarro, Frenk & White 1997).\nOther cosmological information can be obtained from the statistical properties of the\nensemble of X-ray clusters. X-ray observations of cluster number counts, the X-ray temperature function (Henry & Arnoud 1991; Edge et al. 1990; Henry 1997) and the X-ray\nluminosity function (Rosati et al. 1998; Ebeling et al. 1998) are powerful probes for\nconstraining the values of the cosmological parameters \u03a90 and \u03c38 (Henry & Arnoud 1991;\nWhite, Efstathiou & Frenk 1993; Bahcall & Fan 1998; Eke, Cole & Frenk 1996; Kitayama,\nSasaki & Suto 1998). An analytical framework for connecting the X-ray temperature and\nthe luminosity function to theoretical models can be obtained, within the Press & Schecter\n(1974) approach, by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium for the gas distribution and neglecting\nradiative cooling. In accordance with these assumptions, analytical methods can then be\nused to derive predictions for the evolution of the X-ray luminosity function and its correlation with the cluster X-ray temperature (Kaiser 1986; Kitayama & Suto 1996; Mathiesen\n& Evrard 1998; Viana & Liddle 1999).\nGiven the wealth of information which can be obtained from observations of X-ray\nclusters, a lot of efforts have been devoted to obtaining directly the gas and temperature\ndistributions, using numerical simulations for investigating the evolution of galaxy clusters.\nCollisionless N-body simulations have been used to study substructure formation (West,\nOemler & Dekel 1998; Crone, Evrard & Richstone 1996; Buote & Xu 1997; Jing et al.\n1995), density profiles (Crone, Evrard & Richstone 1994; Huss, Jain & Steinmetz 1999;\nMoore et al. 1998; Jing & Suto 2000), and statistical properties in a cosmological volume\n(Eke, Cole & Frenk 1996; Lacey & Cole 1994). In these simulations the dark matter\ndistribution is a good tracer of that of the gas provided that the cluster dynamical state\nis not far from equilibrium, with a small fraction of substructures within the virial radius.\nFurthermore, the dark matter density profile shows no evidence for a core radius (Moore\net al. 1998) whatever numerical resolution is achieved. Numerical simulations have then\nbeen extended to include the hydrodynamics of the gaseous component. The numerical\nmethods used are either Eulerian (Cen & Ostriker 1994; Anninos & Norman 1996; Brian\n& Norman 1998; Kang et al. 1994; Bryan et al. 1994; Cen 1997; Cen et al. 1995), with\na fixed or adaptative grid, or Lagrangian (Evrard 1988, 1990; Thomas & Couchman 1992;\nNavarro, Frenk & White 1995; Eke, Navarro & Frenk 1998; Katz & White 1993; Yoshikawa,\nItoh & Suto 1998; Valdarnini, Ghizzardi & Bonometto 1999). The Lagrangian schemes\nare based on the smoothed particle hydrodynamic technique (SPH: Gingold & Monaghan\n1977; Monaghan 1992). In these simulations the required dynamical range can be quite\ndemanding. A large simulation box is needed in order to obtain a meaningful statistical\nsample of galaxy clusters; at the same time the minimum spatial resolution must be at\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nleast close to the cluster core radii, where the bulk of the X-ray emission originates. For\nLagrangian methods a partial solution is the multimass technique (Katz & White 1993),\nwhere the particles increase their masses according to their distance from the cluster center.\nA single cluster can then be simulated with a comparatively high numerical resolution, with\nexternal shells of matter surrounding the cluster and representing the large-scale gravitational\nfield. In these simulations the gas component is treated as a single adiabatic fluid, without\ntaking into account the effects of radiative cooling, and the physical processes of merging,\nsubstructure formation, shocks and compressional heating of the gas can be modelled in this\nway. A comparison between different numerical simulations shows that they are successful\nin reproducing the gross features of the cluster properties (Frenk et al. 1999).\nThe inclusion of radiative cooling for the gas is important on scales where the gas cooling\ntime is shorter than the Hubble time. For galaxy clusters the spatial extent of this region\nis between 50 and 200 Kpc from the cluster center. A gas cooling radius rcool can then be\ndefined where the two time scales are equal. There is of observational evidence that numerical\nsimulations must include radiative cooling, together with star formation and energy feedback,\nin order to model adequately the relevant physical processes of the gas during its evolution.\nIn the inner regions where the radiative time scales are short, a cooling flow develops (Fabian\n1994), with rcool \u2243 50h\u22121 Kpc. More than 50% of clusters are estimated to have their cores\nin this phase (Peres et al. 1998). These instabilities can affect several properties, like the\nLX \u2212TX relation (Fabian et al. 1994; Allen & Fabian 1998a; Markevitch 1998). In addition\nto cooling flows there is also strong observational support for non-gravitational heating of the\ncluster gas. Simple scaling arguments predict LX \u221d TX2 (Kaiser 1986), while the observed\nrelation satisfies LX \u221d TX3 (David et al. 1993). This discrepancy has been suggested\nby many authors (Evrard & Henry 1991; Wu, Fabian & Nulsen 1998; Ponman, Cannon &\nNavarro 1999) as being evidence for substantial heating of the intracluster gas due to energy\ninjection by supernova explosions at high redshifts. Another central question for including\nstar formation in simulations of the gaseous component is the growing observational evidence\nfor radial gradients in the iron abundance (Ezawa et al. 1997; Fukazawa et al. 1998), with\npossible connections to cooling flows (Allen & Fabian 1998b).\nWith increasing availability of computational power, numerical hydrodynamical simulations have attempted to model the effects of radiative cooling of the gas in the formation and\nevolution of cluster galaxies (Katz & White 1993; Suginohara & Ostriker 1998; Anninos &\nNorman 1996; Yoshikawa, Jing & Suto 2000; Pearce et al. 2000; Lewis et al. 2000). The\nnumerical problems posed by the inclusion of gas cooling are challenging, mainly because the\nrequired increase in spatial resolution also requires that one keeps two-body heating mechanisms under control. Moreover, it will be seen that the inclusion of radiative cooling for\nthe gas cannot be separated from considering also star formation and energy feedback from\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nSN explosions, in order to obtain realistic cluster density profiles and luminosities. Previous\nsimulations have produced some conflicting results (Yoshikawa, Jing & Suto 2000; Pearce\net al. 2000), and so the question of the minimum resolution in this kind of simulation is\nstill to be fully settled. The purpose of this paper is to test the numerical reliability of SPH\nhydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation. These simulations will include the effects\nof radiative losses, star formation and energy feedback from SN. Four different clusters from\ntwo cosmological models have been studied in several simulations with different numerical\ninputs and star formation modelling. Final profiles are compared in order to assess the effects on the integrations of numerical resolution, and different star formation prescriptions.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 I describe the hydrodynamical simulations with\nradiative cooling and star formation that have been performed. The simulation results are\nthen discussed in \u00a73. In particular, \u00a73.1 is dedicated to a comparison between different runs\nof the final radial density and temperature profiles, as well as of the X-ray luminosities. In\n\u00a73.2 the simulation results are compared with previous findings. In \u00a73.3 simulation runs with\ndifferent star formation prescriptions are performed for a chosen test cluster which showed\na well defined cooling instability. In \u00a73.4 simulation results for runs with different prescriptions for star formation are compared against observed data from cooling flow clusters, in\norder to assess the consistency with real data for the assumed star formation models in the\nsimulations. Finally the main conclusions are summarized in \u00a74.\n\n2.\n\nSimulations\n\nIn a previous paper (Valdarnini, Ghizzardi & Bonometto 1999, hereafter VGB) a large\nset of hydrodynamical simulations was used to study global X-ray cluster morphology and its\nevolution. The simulations were run using a TREESPH code with no gas cooling or heating.\nIn order to assess the numerical reliability of the numerical integrations, four different clusters\nwere selected as a representative sample of all of the simulation clusters. For this cluster\nsample, a large set of different integrations was performed by varying two numerical input\nparameters: the number of particles and the softening parameter. A comparison between the\nfinal gas density and temperature profiles, as well as with X-ray luminosities, then allowed\nthe two-body heating to be kept under control and a fairly safe range of allowed values for the\nnumerical parameters to be established. The simulation tests showed the relative importance\nof different numerical effects in these adiabatic simulations. It is therefore natural to use the\nsame cluster sample to study the effects of including additional physics such as gas cooling\nand star formation. A comparison with the previous tests in VGB will show, with respect\nto the adiabatic case, the effects on the final cluster properties of considering energy sinks\nand non-gravitational heating. Here I give a short description of the cluster simulations\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nperformed in VGB; the reader is referred to the original paper for more details. Numerical\nmodelling of gas cooling and gas conversion into collisionless stars is described later.\nIn VGB three spatially flat cosmological models have been considered. A standard cold\ndark matter model (CDM) , a vacuum-energy dominated model with \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 (\u039bCDM) and\na mixed dark matter model (CHDM). For the Hubble constant H0 = 100hKm sec\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ,\nh = 0.5 is used for CDM and CHDM and h = 0.7 for \u039bCDM. For all models, the primeval\nspectral index n = 1 and the baryon density parameter \u03a9b h2 = 0.015. For CHDM \u03a9h = 0.20\nis the HDM density parameter of massive neutrinos; only one massive species is considered.\nAll of the models were normalized in order to reproduce the present cluster abundance\n(Eke, Cole & Frenk 1996; Girardi et al. 1998). The cosmologies were chosen in order\nto have simple models with different properties. For each model an N-body cosmological\nsimulation was first run in a L = 200h\u22121 Mpc comoving box using a P 3 M code. The particle\nnumber were Np = 106 for the CDM and CHDM models with \u03a9m = 1, while Np = 843 for\n\u039bCDM with \u03a9m = 0.3. The same random numbers were used to set the initial conditions\nfor all three cosmological models. The simulations started from an initial redshift zin . At\nz = 0 clusters of galaxies were located using a friends\u2013of\u2013friends (FoF) algorithm, so as to\ndetect overdensities in excess of \u2243 200\u03a9\u22120.6\nm . For statistical analysis, VGB selected for each\nmodel the 40 most massive clusters. For each of these clusters a TREESPH hydrodynamical\nsimulation was performed in physical coordinates. The integration was accomplished by\nfirst locating at z = 0 the cluster center and identifying all of the simulation particles of\nthe cosmological simulation within r200 , where the cluster density is \u2243 200\u03a9\u22120.6\ntimes the\nm\nbackground density. These particles are located back at zin , in the original simulation box,\nand a cube of size Lc enclosing all of them is then found, with a size \u2243 15 \u2212 25h\u22121 Mpc. A\nlattice of NL = 223 grid points is set inside this cube; different lattices were used for each\nmatter component. At each node position is associated a particle of corresponding mass and\ncoordinates. The particles were then perturbed, using the same random realization as for\nthe cosmological simulations. Additional frequencies are introduced so to sample the higher\nNyquist frequency. The baryon particles are perturbed identically to the CDM particles\nand their initial temperature is set to Ti = 104 \u25e6K. For the TREESPH simulations all the\nparticles which lie inside a sphere of radius Lc /2 are kept. External gravitational fields are\nmodelled by considering a larger cube of side 2Lc , inside the cube particle positions are set as\nfor the smaller cube, but with no gas. The number of grid points is the same as for the inner\ncube, so that masses are 8 times larger than those of the inner cube; particles of the larger\ncube are considered only outside the smaller one. After the particle positions are perturbed,\nonly those within a sphere of radius Lc from the cluster center are kept for the TREEPSH\nsimulations. This multimass grid technique has already been used in cluster simulations by\nKatz & White (1993) and Navarro, Frenk and White (1995).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nFor each particle, the gravitational softening parameters are set according to the scaling\n1/3\n\u03b5i \u221d mi . The numerical integrations were performed with a tolerance parameter \u03b8 = 0.7,\nwithout quadrupole corrections. The reliability of the numerical resolution was tested in\nVGB by taking the most massive and least massive clusters (labels 00 and 39, respectively)\nfor the two models CHDM and \u039bCDM. For each of them, different numerical tests were\ncarried out. Accordingly to VGB, the cluster simulations can be performed with an ade>\nquate resolution using a number of gas particles Ng \u223c\n5, 000 and a gas softening parameter\n\u22121\n<\n\u03b5g \u223c 50h Kpc. For the collisionless component the corresponding values are scaled accordingly. In Table 1 the reference values for the four clusters are given. If one introduces\nradiative cooling then the final values for the core radius of the gas density are expected to\nbe smaller than in the no-cooling case. This implies that the numerical simulations must\nhave smaller values for the gas softening \u03b5g , which in SPH sets a minimum resolvable scale,\n>\nsince SPH smoothing lengths are constrained to be \u223c\n\u03b5g /4. The shape of the density profile\nimplies, with respect to the adiabatic case, higher values for the gas and dark matter densities at the core radius. This in turn implies that larger values for the number of particles\nare required in simulations of cooling clusters. This is essential in order to reduce the values\nof particle masses and hence the two-body heating time \u03c4r , which approximately scales as\n\u03c4r \u221d 1/(\u03c1d md ), where \u03c1d and md are the dark matter density and particle mass.\nIn order to check for these numerical effects, for each of the four test clusters a set of\nfive TREESPH simulations was performed, using the same initial conditions and with the\ninclusion of radiative cooling, but for different values of \u03b5g and Ng . With respect to the\nreference case, the other matter components have their particle numbers changed in proportion to the change in Ng . For the cluster \u039bCDM00, Table 2 reports the values of \u03b5g and\nNg for the five simulation runs. Table 4 is for CHDM00. For these two clusters the generic\nsimulation has cluster index cl00 \u2212 j, with j = 00, 01, ..., 05. The cluster cl00 \u2212 00 is the\nreference case without cooling. The simulations have been carried out with the same values\nfor the other numerical parameters that were used in VGB, with the difference that here the\nminimum allowed time step for gas particles is \u2206tm = 6.9 105 yr. For the clusters \u039bCDM39\nand CHDM39, the parameters of the numerical tests cl39 \u2212 j are given in Table 5. For these\nsimulation runs, the number of particles and the initial redshifts are the same as for the 00\nclusters. Therefore Table 5 reports only the particle masses and softenings. The effects of\nradiative cooling are modelled in these simulations by adding to the SPH thermal energy\nequation an energy-sink term (Hernquist & Katz 1989, eq. [2.29]). The total cooling function includes contributions from recombination and collisional excitation, bremsstrahlung\n>\nand inverse Compton cooling. For cluster temperatures which satisfy T \u223c\n2KeV , a condition which is always satisfied for the cluster sample studied here, the dominant cooling\nmechanisms are free-free transitions, but line cooling becomes important for small clusters\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nand groups. For the same reason, heating from an ionizing UV background is not included in\nthe thermal energy equation. The radiative cooling is computed for a gas having primordial\nabundances X = 0.75, Y = 0.25 with zero metallicity. In the simulation runs where the gas\nparticles are allowed to convert part of their mass into stars (see below), the back effects\nof metallicities on the cooling function are neglected. This is a valid approximation as long\n>\n<\n<\nas T \u223c\n2KeV and stellar metallicities are below Z \u223c\nZ\u2299 ([F e/H] \u223c\n0) (Brian & Norman\n1998; Carraro, Lia & Chiosi 1998).\nIn addition to these simulations, which include the effects of radiative cooling, a mirror\nsimulation was performed for each of them. The mirror runs had an additional prescription\nwhich allowed eligible gas to be turned into stars. These simulations are indexed as cl00 \u2212 k\nand cl39 \u2212 k, where k = j + 5 and j is the index of the pure cooling runs in Tables 2, 4 & 5.\nFor the cluster \u039bCDM00 the simulation parameters for the cooling runs with star formation,\ncl00 \u2212 k, are given in Table 3. The numerical parameters of the simulations with radiative\ncooling and star formation are the same as the corresponding cooling simulations. For this\nreason Table 3 reports parameters only for the cluster \u039bCDM00. The additional simulation\nwith k = 11 in Table 3 has the same parameters as the k = 10 run, but with \u03b8 = 1 and\nquadrupole corrections, instead of \u03b8 = 0.7. This is done in order to check the accuracy of the\ngravitational integration when a collisionless population, with a different distribution from\nthat of dark matter, is added to the simulation. Allowing the gas to cool radiatively will\nproduce dense clumps of gas at low temperatures (\u2243 104 \u25e6K). Thus cooling times will become\nshorter and even denser regions will develop. This is known as the overcooling instability\n(Suginohara & Ostriker 1998). In these regions the gas will be thermally unstable and will\nmeet the physical conditions to form stars. In TREESPH simulations, star formation (SF)\nprocesses have been implemented using two different algorithms (Katz 1992; Navarro &\nWhite 1993). According to Katz (1992), a gas particle is in a star forming region if the flow\nis convergent and the local sound crossing time is larger than the dynamical time (i.e. the\nfluid is Jeans unstable). These two conditions read\n\u001a\n\n\u2207 * ~vi < 0p\nhi /ci >\n3\u03c0/16G\u03c1i \u2261 \u03c4d ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere ~vi is the particle velocity, hi the SPH smoothing length and ci is the local sound\nvelocity. In a more refined version, Katz, Weinberg & Hernquist (1996, hereafter KWH)\nintroduced two additional requirements: a star forming region must have a minimum physical\nhydrogen number density nH = 0.1cm\u22123 and the local gas density must satisfy \u03c1g /\u03c1\u0304g > 55.7\n( this follows from an isothermal profile giving a mean virialized overdensity of \u2243 169). If\na gas particle meets these criteria then it is selected as an eligible particle to form stars.\nIn regions where the gas density is depressed because of gravitational softening, the Jeans\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ncriterion is not applied, in order to avoid an underestimate of the local star formation rate\n(SFR) (Katz 1992, eq.[2]). The local SFR obeys the equation\nd\u03c1g /dt = \u2212c\u22c6 \u03c1g /\u03c4g = \u2212d\u03c1\u22c6 /dt ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c1g is the gas density, \u03c1\u22c6 is the star density , c\u22c6 is a characteristic dimensionless efficiency\nparameter, \u03c4g is the local collapse time (the maximum of the local cooling time \u03c4c and the\n<\ndynamical time \u03c4d ). Gas particles with T \u223c\n104 \u25e6K have long cooling times and \u03c4g = \u03c4d . The\nprobability that a gas particle will form stars in a time step \u2206t is given by\np = 1 \u2212 exp (\u2212c\u22c6 \u2206t/\u03c4g ).\n\n(3)\n\nA uniform random number \u03ber is generated at every time step for each of the gas particles\nsatisfying the star formation criterion, and equation (3) is used to compute the formation\nprobability p. If \u03ber < p then a mass fraction \u03b5\u22c6 of the mass of the gas is converted into a new\ncollisionless particle. This star particle has the position, velocity and gravitational softening\nof the original gas particle. Typical assumed values are \u03b5\u22c6 = 1/3 and c\u22c6 = 0.1 (KWH).\nThe second algorithm for implementing SF in TREESPH simulations has been introduced by Navarro & White (1993 , hereafter NW). According to NW, any gas particle which\nis in a convergent flow and for which the density exceeds a threshold , i.e.\n\u001a\n\n\u2207 * ~vi < 0\n\u03c1g >\n\u03c1g,c = 7 * 10\u221226 grcm\u22123,\n\n(4)\n\n<\nwill have cooling time shorter than the dynamical time and will soon cool to T \u223c\n104 \u25e6K\n, thus satisfying the Jeans instability criterion. The two conditions (4) are necessary and\nsufficient conditions for selecting gas particles as prone to SF. For the local SFR, NW adopted\nequation (2) with c\u22c6 = 1, \u03c4g = \u03c4d and \u03b5\u22c6 = 1/2 as the condition for which a gas particle\ncan convert part of its mass into a star particle. These two algorithms will be referred to\nhereafter as KWH and NW, respectively.\n\nThe numerical tests cl00 \u2212 k and cl39 \u2212 k have been performed following the NW\nprescription for selecting gas particles which can form stars. The NW method has been\npreferred over KWH because of its simpler assumptions about the physical conditions of the\ngas in star forming regions. Because of the many physical processes involved in SF, having\na minimal number of assumptions can reduce possible biases in hydrodynamical simulations\nwhen modelling the local SFR. For a single representative cluster, a detailed comparison\nhas been made between the cluster properties obtained using the two methods and different\ninput values for the SF parameters. These simulation runs with numerical modelling of SF\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nalso include energy feedback to cluster gas from supernova (SN) explosions. Once a star\nparticle is created it can release energy into the surrounding gas through SN explosions.\nThis energy is converted into heat of the neighboring gas at each time step, according to\nthe stellar lifetime and initial mass function. A standard Miller-Scalo (1979) mass function\nhas been adopted in the mass range from 0.1 to 100M\u2299 . All of the stars with masses above\n8M\u2299 end as SNe, leaving a 1.4M\u2299 remnant. Each SN explosion produces \u03b5SN \u2243 1051 erg\n, or \u2243 7.5 * 1048 erg /M\u2299 , which is added to the thermal energy of the gas. Current time\nsteps are much smaller than stellar lifetimes, and so the SN energy is released gradually\ninto the gas according to the lifetime of stars of different masses. At each time step, the\nfraction of stars releasing their energy into the medium is calculated for any star particle and\nthe corresponding SN energy is spread over neighboring gas particles according to the SPH\nsmoothing prescription. SN explosions also inject enriched material into the intracluster\nmedium, thus increasing its metallicity with time. According to Steinmetz & Muller (1994)\npZ = 0.357m\u22122.2 solar masses of heavy elements are synthesized by a SN progenitor of mass\nm. The enrichment in metals of the intracluster medium is modelled as follows (Steinmetz\n& Mueller 1994; Carraro, Lia & Chiosi 1998). Each SPH gas particle initially has zero\nmetallicity; star particles are produced with the metallicity of the parent gas particle at the\nepoch of their creation. The metallicity of gas particles is successively enriched at each time\nstep according to the fraction of exploding SNe associated with each star particle. The mass\nin metals produced by these explosions is calculated in accordance with the specified function\npZ , and is added to the metallicities of the gas neighbors of the star particle. This mass is\ndistributed over the neighbors using a smoothing procedure identical to that implemented\nfor spreading the SN feedback energy of star particles among internal energies of the gas\nneighbors. According to the same procedure, the current mass fraction of exploding SNe\nwith M \u2265 8M\u2299 is also added to the mass of the gas particles, with the exception of the\n1.4M\u2299 remnant.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\n\nCluster simulations with radiative cooling and cooling plus star formation\n\nThe radial density and temperature profiles for the pure cooling runs are shown in Figures 1 & 2. The cluster center has been identified as the maximum of the gas density. For\neach radial bin spherical averaged quantities have been obtained by estimating hydrodynamical variables at 100 grid points uniformly spaced in angular coordinates. Densities and\ntemperatures at the grid points were computed from SPH variables according to the SPH\nsmoothing procedure. The cluster \u039bCDM00 is a particularly neat example of the effects at\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nwork in the simulations. As can be inferred from the softening values reported in Table 2, the\nnumerical strategy has been first to run cl00 \u2212 00 with the additional cooling prescriptions\n(cl00 \u2212 01) and in subsequent runs the value of \u03b5g has been reduced in order to resolve the\ncore radius of the gas density profile. Figure 1a shows that this is not achieved: whatever\nis the value of \u03b5g , there is no evidence of a gas core radius, the gas density continues to rise\nsteeply at the cluster center without any indication of converging to a constant value. This\nresult is in strict agreement with those of others (Suginohara & Ostriker 1998; Anninos &\nNorman 1996; Pearce et al. 2000; Lewis et al. 2000) and it is known as the overcooling\ninstability; at the cluster center cooling times are very short because the gas density is high,\nthus drawing in more more material. The fact that the gas central density continues to\nrise as the spatial resolution is increased suggests that the extent of the (physical) effect is\nlimited by the numerical resolution of the simulation. Of the four test clusters, CHDM00\nis the only one which does not show the cooling instability with the exception of cl00 \u2212 05\n(Figure 2a). The reason for this behavior may be dynamical. Buote & Tsai (1996) measured\na negative correlation of the cooling rate with the cluster X-ray substructure. The cooling\ninstability can then be strongly suppressed when the cluster is still in a young dynamical\nstate, with a large fraction of substructure. For the cosmology considered, VGB found that\nthe clusters studied in the CHDM model with \u03a9m = 1 had many more substructures than\nthose in the low-density \u039bCDM model. In this case CHDM00 could be marginally stable,\nwith instability being triggered by numerical effects when the central value of the gas density\nincreases because the simulation resolution is increased.\nIn the simulation runs the number of particles was increased as \u03b5g was reduced so as to\nkeep 2-body heating under control. The relaxation time \u03c4r , due to 2-body effects, is defined\nas\n\u03c33\n\n\u03c4r = 0.34 G2 md \u03c11d ln \u039b \u2243 6.7 * 105 Gyr\n\u22122\n\n\u03c31\n103 Kmsec\u22121\n\n1\nh\n\u00d7 (md /10\n11 M ) (\u03c1 /\u03c1 ) ln \u039b ,\nc\n\u2299\nd\n\n\u00013\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03c31 is the 1-D dark matter velocity dispersion, G is the gravitational constant, \u03c1d\nis the dark matter density; ln \u039b is the Coulomb logarithm, with \u039b \u2243 Rh /4\u03b5g , and Rh is\nthe half-mass radius. Typical values are ln \u039b \u2243 3; standard theory gives \u039b \u2243 Rh /\u03b5, the\nfactor 4 above accounts for the softening bimodal distribution (Farouki & Salpeter 1982).\nFor the simulations cl00 \u2212 00 and cl39 \u2212 00 the relaxation time \u03c4r has been estimated at\nradius \u2243 0.05r200 \u2243 100Kpc, approximately the resolution limit of these simulations. At this\nlength scale \u03c1d /\u03c1c \u2243 2 * 104 . The values of \u03c4r range from \u2243 13Gyr (cl00 \u2212 00) to \u2243 17Gyr\n(cl39 \u2212 00). For the simulation runs with increased resolution the minimum resolvable scale\nis set by \u03b5g , and \u03c1/\u03c1c \u2243 5 * 104 at a fiducial scale \u2243 50Kpc. These rather high values of \u03c1d\nare a consequence of the slightly steeper profiles for dark matter in the inner regions, with\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nrespect to the case with no cooling. For these runs, the increase in \u03c1d is compensated by a\ncorresponding increase in the particle number and hence a smaller value for md , so that \u03c4r\nis approximately constant at the scale considered and is close to the Hubble time. Another\ntimescale which is relevant for these simulations is the cooling time \u03c4c , defined as\n3 nkB T\n,\n(6)\n2 \u039bc\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant, n is the gas number density, T is the gas temperature\nand \u039bc \u2243 5.2 * 10\u221228 T 1/2 n2 ergsec\u22121 cm\u22123 is the cooling function. In the central gas regions\n\u03c4c << H0\u22121 and a cooling instability will develop. In Figure 5 \u03c4c is shown as a function of\nradius for the four test clusters. For the cooling runs cl00 \u2212 05, cl39 \u2212 05 \u03c4c is always below\n<\n\u2243 20Gyr for r \u223c\n100Kpc, with the exception of \u039bCDM39 , which has a bump but then a\nstrong fall in \u03c4c proceeding inwards. For the sake of reference, \u03c4c for the no-cooling case\n( \u221200) has also been plotted. Because of the presence of a gas core radius in this case \u03c4c\napproaches a constant value towards the center. According to Steinmetz & White (1997)\ngas cooling will be affected by artificial 2-body heating unless \u03c4c (r) < \u03c4r (r). This condition\nis satisfied if the dark particle mass is smaller than the critical value\n\u03c4c =\n\nMc = 2 * 109 T6 f0.05 M\u2299 ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere T6 is the the gas temperature in units of 106 \u25e6K, f0.05 is the ratio f = \u03c1g /\u03c1d in units\n>\n<\nof 0.05. For the simulated clusters studied here T6 \u2243 50 \u2212 100, f0.05 \u223c\n0.5 for r \u223c\n100Kpc\nand Mc is always above md . The simulations can then be considered free from numerical\neffects which can dominate the gas behavior. In the cooling simulations this condition might\n<\n<\nbe violated near the cluster\np center, where T6 \u223c 10 for r \u223c 50Kpc. However, in these regions\n\u22121\n\u03c4c << \u03c4d \u2243 27h Gyr/ \u03c1d /\u03c1c and the cooling is effective in removing the gas energy at a\nfaster rate than the one set by dynamical effects.\n<\nThe temperature profiles show a decrease for r \u223c\n100Kpc and a drastic drop in the\ncentral values, where cooling is most effective. This inversion in temperature takes place in\nall of the tests considered. Peak values for the gas temperature are located at \u2243 100Kpc\n(0.05\u22120.1 of r200 ). Between this distance from the cluster center and r200 the gas temperature\ndecreases with radius and the clusters clearly cannot be considered isothermal. These results\nare in agreement with those of Pearce et al. (2000), and suggest that the global cluster\nproperties are affected by cooling processes active on inner scales , where the cooling time is\nshort (see also Lewis et al. 2000). The most important cluster variable which is affected by\nthese results is the cluster X-ray luminosity. For evaluating LX the standard SPH estimator\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\ngives\nLX = 5.2 * 10\n\n\u221228\n\nNg\nX\n1\n1/2\nmi \u03c1i Ti ergsec\u22121 ,\n2\n(\u03bcmp ) i\n\n(8)\n\nwhere, for the cooling function, the bremsstrahlung emissivity has been approximated with\na gaunt factor of 1.2 (eq.[2] of Suginohara & Ostriker 1998), \u03bc = 0.6 is the mean molecular\nweight, and mp is the proton mass. The summation is over all of the gas particles within\nr200 . Figure 7 shows the behavior of LX at z = 0 as a function of \u03b5g for the pure cooling\nruns (open symbols). There is not a clear convergence of LX as the resolution is increased.\nIn fact LX obeys the approximate scaling LX \u221d 1/\u03b5\u223c5\ng . Similar results for LX have been\nobtained by Anninos & Norman (1996) in their convergence study of simulations of X-ray\nclusters.\nThe unphysically high values found for LX in the pure cooling runs arise because the gas\ndensity continues to increase steadily at the cluster center, while the conditions of high gas\ndensity and low temperature cause the gas to become Jeans unstable. Thus the treatment\nof gas cooling in cluster simulations cannot be decoupled from a modelling of the physical\nprocesses turning the cold, dense, gas into stars. The cooling simulations have therefore been\nrerun with the inclusion in the integrations of an algorithm for converting gas into stars.\nThis used the NW method, with parameters c\u22c6 = 1 and \u03b5\u22c6 = 1/2. In these simulations\ngas particles can produce star particles without any limit on the number of star-forming\nevents. Furthermore, the SN explosion energies and metallicities that star particles can\nproduce are smoothed over 32 gas neighbors but with an upper limit of hM = 15Kpc for\nthe SPH smoothing length. This is in order to avoid unphysical heating of the gas over\nlength scales much larger than those involved in the SF activities. This upper limit is also\njustified by the lack of diffusion in the ICM of the metals injected from galaxies (Ezawa et\nal. 1997). The results obtained are shown in Figures 3 and 4; the index of the simulations\nis k = j + 5, where j is the index of the cooling runs. The most important result is that\nthe inclusion of an SF model has been effective in removing the unphysical gas behavior,\nwhich now shows a well defined core radius in the radial density plots. This is valid in all of\nthe cases considered, with the expection of CHDM00. The simulation runs cl00 \u2212 k do not\nshow, for this cluster, evidence of an SF activity, a result which is in agreement with the lack\nof a cooling instability in the cooling simulations cl00 \u2212 j. The shapes of the temperature\n>\nprofiles show that convergence is achieved for Ng \u223c\n20, 000. For the simulation runs with\nthe highest resolution, all of the central values for the gas temperatures at r = 10Kpc\nare within a factor \u2243 1.5. CHDM39 is an exception to this rule, with cl39 \u2212 10 still not\nshowing a flat temperature profile in the inner regions and resembling that of cl39 \u2212 05. It\nis unlikely that the source of the discrepancy is due to a convergence problem: cl39 \u2212 11 has\na slightly larger accuracy in the computation of the gravitational forces (Hernquist 1987),\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nnevertheless its temperature profile has these discrepancies largely removed. For CHDM39\nthe peculiarity of cl39\u221210 in the final temperature profile, with respect to the other numerical\ntests shown in Figure 4b, could be of a numerical nature: for a certain accuracy in the tree\nevaluation of the gravitational forces, matter subclumps might form during the integrations\nwhich can then modify the gas dynamics. The formation of these sub-clumps is triggered\nby the approximations involved in the truncation of the multipole expansion of the cluster\ngravitational potential. The statistical occurrence of this effect should be small, because it\nis not observed in the other three test clusters. For a tree method the errors involved in the\nmultipole expansion of the gravitational potential have been estimated by Hernquist (1987)\nassuming a spherical, isotropic Plummer model for the mass distribution of N test particles.\nA comparison against the accelerations obtained by a direct sum shows that in the large\n>\nN limit (N \u223c\n30, 000) the errors in the tree evaluation of the accelerations are negligible\n<\nfor a monopole expansion if \u03b8 \u223c\n1. The inclusion of the quadrupole terms improves the\naccuracy of the force computation, for \u03b8 \u2243 1 the errors in the forces are those of a monopole\nexpansion with \u03b8 \u2243 0.8. The convergence in T (r) obtained for cl39 \u2212 11 suggests that for a\ngiven accuracy, quadrupole corrections should be preferred when evaluating tree forces.\nThe radial density profiles of the star component are also shown for the various runs in\nthe density plots. The slope of these profiles is approximately \u2243 \u22123, a value close to the one\nobserved for galaxy populations in galaxy clusters. In all of the simulations, the gas density\nprofiles have a well-defined core radius, with size rc \u2243 50 \u2212 100Kpc, approximately 0.05 of\nthe virial radii. From the density profiles note also that the gas core radii are smaller than\nin the no-cooling runs, outwards of rc the density profiles are very similar to the no-cooling\ncases. The temperature profiles increase inwards from the virial radius up to \u2243 100\u2212200Kpc.\nThereafter the profiles stay almost flat, or with a modest decrease in T (r) towards r = 0.\nThe strong drop of the temperatures in the very central regions for the cooling runs is no\nlonger seen, the inclusion of a star formation prescription having been effective in removing\n<\nthe cold gas particles ( \u223c\n104 \u25e6K) from the cluster centers.\nCooling timescales \u03c4c (r) are plotted in Figure 5; the dashed line in the four panels is\nfor the simulation runs including SF. As a general rule, for each test cluster, the \u03c4c are\n>\nalmost indistinguishable in all of the simulation tests for r \u223c\n100Kpc. In the simulations\nincluding SF, \u03c4c moves toward the no-cooling case in the cluster inner regions because of\nthe reduction in the gas central density. The central values of \u03c4c are well below the present\nage of the universe for all of the models, with the exception of CHDM00. This cluster does\nnot show a cooling instability and has \u03c4c \u2243 20Gyr in the cluster core. Accretion rates\n\u1e40 (r) = 4\u03c0\u03c1g r 2 vr are plotted in Figure 6 for the same test clusters as in Figure 5. For each\nradial bin, spherical averages of \u1e40 (r) are shown only for negative values of vr . For the test\nclusters in the \u039b-dominated cosmology there is a well defined radial infall of matter within\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n<\nr\u223c\n100Kpc, compared to the adiabatic run. These inflows of matter can be compared with\nthose estimated from X-ray data for cooling flow clusters. For example Thomas, Fabian\n& Nulsen (1987) present mass deposition profiles \u1e40 (< r) for a sample of 11 cooling flow\nclusters. They obtain for Abell 478 \u1e40 \u2243 103 M\u2299 yr \u22121 at r \u2243 300Kpc (Fig. 7 of their paper).\nFor this cluster they quote a measured line-of-sight velocity dispersion of \u2243 750Kmsec\u22121\nand the estimated cluster virial mass ( \u2243 4 * 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) is close to that of \u039bCDM39. This\naccretion rate is in good agreement with the values shown in Figure 6 at r \u2243 300Kpc for\n\u039bCDM39 in the simulation including SF. Note that in order to compare \u1e40 (< r) with \u1e40(r)\none is implicitly assuming a steady-state. The clusters in the cosmology with \u03a9m = 1 show\nvalues of \u1e40 which are higher in the adiabatic case, in comparison with the simulation runs\nincluding cooling and star formation. The reason for this discrepancy is of a dynamical\nnature: CHDM00, for example, has a large radial infall velocity because it is still out of\nequilibrium, with material collapsing onto the center. These results seem to support the\nhypothesis of an anti-correlation between the strength of the cooling flow and the dynamical\nstate of the cluster, as measured by the power ratios, for example. Buote & Tsai (1996)\ndemonstrated the existence of such an anti-correlation, as expected from a dependence of\nthe cooling flow rate on the cluster dynamical state. A statistical analysis of this correlation\nis beyond the scope of this paper and is left to future work, where the analysis will be\nperformed for the whole sample of 40 clusters for each of the three cosmological models\n(VGB). A striking result is the convergence of the final X-ray luminosities for the simulation\nruns including SF for the four test clusters. In Figure 7 the filled symbols refer to these\nsimulations. The divergence for \u03b5g \u2192 0 of the cooling runs is completely removed and the\nplotted values are quite stable. An exception is cl39 \u2212 10 of CHDM39 (the black square\nin the bottom right panel) which has LX \u2243 5 * 1044 ergsec\u22121 . As previously discussed, the\npeculiarity of this cluster is of a dynamical nature and there is not a question of convergence\nof hydrodynamical variables. In fact cl39 \u2212 11 has LX \u2243 2 * 1044 ergsec\u22121, a value in full\nagreement with the values of the other runs. Compared with the non-radiative case, the\nluminosities are stable (CHDM) or increase by a factor \u2243 2 (\u039bCDM).\n\n3.2.\n\nComparison with previous simulations\n\nThese results can be compared with previous findings from hydrodynamical cluster\nsimulations, in which the gas is allowed to undergo cooling and star formation or is subject\nto a prescription for the treatment of cold particles. The density plots can be compared\nto analogous plots shown in Lewis et al. (2000). In their paper Lewis et al. analyzed five\nsimulations of a cluster with M200 \u2243 4 * 1014 M\u2299 in a CDM universe with \u03a9m = 1 and h = 0.5.\nOf these simulations, the Cool + SF allows gas to undergo cooling and star formation, using\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nthe KWH method with c\u22c6 = 0.1 and \u03b5SN = 1. Although the cosmologies are different, a\nrough comparison can be made for \u039bCDM39, which has the closest virial mass to their test\ncluster. For \u039bCDM39 the simulations cl39 \u2212 10 or cl39 \u2212 11 have a numerical resolution\ncomparable to the Lewis et al. (2000) simulations (compare Tables 3 & 4 with Table 2 of\nLewis et al.). Thus the density plots in Figure 3b can be compared with Figure 7 of Lewis\net al. . The results are encouraging, there is a rough agreement for the various baryonic\ncomponents, although in Lewis et al. there is a central spike in the gas density which is\nnot observed in the present simulations. A substantial difference is instead found for the\ntemperature profiles: all of the simulation runs show a tendency for T (r) to recover an almost\nflat behavior in the inner regions (with the exception of cl39 \u2212 10 for CHDM39, which is\npeculiar for the reasons previously outlined). Lewis et al. found instead that T (r) in their\nCool + SF simulation reaches a peak value of \u2243 8 * 107 \u25e6K within \u2243 40Kpc (Figure 9 of Lewis\net al.). The radial behaviors of Figure 5 (\u03c4c (r)) compare well with Figure 8 of Lewis et al.\n(2000).\nHydrodynamical simulations of cooling clusters have also been analyzed by Pearce et\nal. (2000) and Yoshikawa, Jing & Suto (2000). I discuss here in detail how the results of\n\u00a73.1 compare with the cluster properties of Yoshikawa, Jing & Suto (2000, hereafter YJS).\nThe simulated clusters of the Pearce et al. (2000) runs have properties similar to the YJS\nclusters, the only substantial differences being found for the X-ray luminosities.\nIn their paper YJS analyze results from a set of cosmological SPH simulations and\nconcluded that estimates of the X-ray luminosities are biased by the numerical resolution of\nthe simulations and are not reliable. The cosmological simulations of YJS were performed in\na flat, \u039b-dominated CDM cosmology. The values of the background cosmological parameter\nare identical to the ones chosen here for the cluster simulations in the \u039bCDM model. They\nperformed simulations with two different box sizes : L = 75h\u22121 Mpc and L = 150h\u22121 Mpc.\nThey took 1283 gas particles, an equal number of dark particles, and a comoving softening\nparameter \u03b5 = L/1280. In the simulations including radiative cooling, cold gas particles were\nremoved from the summations defining local gas variables if the Jeans condition in equation\n(1) is satisfied (simulation runs with label UJ in their notation). This constraint is slightly\n<\n104 \u25e6K. Their\ndifferent from the one of Pearce et al. (2000), but is almost identical for Ti \u223c\nprescription is phenomenological and is intended to take into account the process of galaxy\nformation. For the cosmological simulation with box size L = 150h\u22121 Mpc, the numerical\nresolution for the most luminous clusters is comparable to that of the cl00 \u2212 11 run. The\nmost massive cluster in the simulation with label 150UJ has \u2243 1.56 * 1015 M\u2299 , a value close\nto that of M200 in Table 1 for \u039bCDM00. For this cluster YJS found at z = 0 a bolometric\nX-ray luminosity \u2243 2 * 1045ergsec\u22121 , about twice the corresponding value of LX for cl00 \u2212 11.\nA comparison between the cluster density and temperature profiles (Figure 1 of their paper,\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\ncentral panel) and the analogous plots of the present paper (cl00 \u2212 11 in Figure 3) shows\n<\nthat there are substantial differences at r \u223c\n50Kpc. In YJS the cluster gas density shows\nno evidence for a core radius; the mass-weighted temperature profile has an inversion at the\ncluster center, as also found by Pearce et al. (2000), while cl00 \u2212 11 shows a nearly flat\nprofile for T (r). These differences in the gas profiles at the cluster centers are probably due\nto the different methods employed for the treatment of the cooled gas, rather than to the\nnumerical resolution of the simulations.\nYJS adopted the phenomenological prescription of treating separately those gas particles\nwhich satisfy the Jeans criterion. Therefore the gas distribution consists of gas particles in\na 'hot' X-ray emitting phase together with a population of cold particles at temperatures\naround 104 \u25e6K, the latter being localized at the cluster center. The temperature profiles in\nYJS include the cold gas population 1 and show a steep decrease at the cluster center. In\nthe simulation run cl00 \u2212 11 this is not observed because the star formation prescription\nhas been effective in converting the cooled gas at the cluster center into the form of stars.\nFor the simulation runs with cooling and star formation, the mass-weighted temperatures\nTm (sim) of the clusters \u039bCDM00 and \u039bCDM39 can be compared with those expected from\nthe isothermal mass-temperature relation. At the present epoch, this relation reads:\n\nkB TX \u2243 5.2\u03b3\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a9m \u2206c\n178\n\n\u00131/3 \u0012\n\nM\n15\n10 h\u22121 M\u2299\n\n\u00132/3\n\nKeV,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere M is the cluster virial mass, \u2206c \u2243 178\u03a9\u22120.55\nis the virialized cluster overdensity and\nm\n\u03b3 is a fudge factor. YJS found that the mass-weighted temperatures of their simulated\nclusters are well fitted by equation 9 with \u03b3 = 1.2. For the cluster \u039bCDM00 (\u039bCDM39)\nI find from the simulations cl00 \u2212 11(cl39 \u2212 11) that Tm (sim) = 5.6(3.1)KeV , while the\ntheoretical relation (9) gives Tm (th) = 5.9(2.8)KeV . Thus the mass-weighted temperatures\nof the simulated clusters are in close agreement with the theoretical predictions and also\nwith those found by YJS in their simulations.\nAs previously shown in the simulation runs including star formation, the X-ray luminosities are found to be numerically stable and converging to reliable values. With respect to the\nadiabatic runs, the LX are found to be constant or with a modest increase (Figure 7). These\nresults are at variance with those of Pearce et al. (2000), who found that cooling clusters are\nless luminous than those in the no-cooling runs. Similar results have been obtained by YJS\nand Lewis et al. (2000), who measured an increase in the final X-ray luminosity when cooling\nwas included. A comparison with the Cool+SF simulation of Lewis et al. (2000) is difficult\n1\n\nK. Yoshikawa: private communication\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nbecause of the different cosmologies and cluster virial masses. YJS analyzed the LX \u2212 TX relation obtained from the simulated clusters in the UJ test runs at z = 0, from the simulations\nwith two different box sizes. The cluster luminosities in the simulation with L = 150h\u22121 Mpc\nare found to be underestimated with respect to the ones of the L = 75h\u22121 Mpc simulation\nbox. YJS draw the conclusion that, in order to have reliable cluster luminosities, simulations of cooling clusters require a much higher numerical resolution than the one employed\nin their simulations. In the simulations with L = 150h\u22121 Mpc, the mass of the gas particles\nis \u2243 2 * 1010 M\u2299 , a factor \u2243 2 larger than that of cl00 \u2212 10 for \u039bCDM00. Therefore their\nconclusion seems to be in conflict with what is claimed here, that substantial convergence\nin X-ray luminosities is achieved for the highest resolution simulation runs. The source of\nthis discrepancy lies in the different numerical approaches. YJS simulated cluster evolution\nin a cosmological box with a constant gas particle mass. As outlined by the authors, the\nresolution problem is severe for the less luminous clusters in the simulation box. The multimass technique described in \u00a72 is instead used here to simulate a single cluster. The results\nof the numerical simulations show that convergence in the gas variables is obtained for each\n>\nsingle cluster whenever Ng \u223c\n20, 000. A comparison with the numerical resolution adopted\nby YJS is useful. In their simulations with L = 150h\u22121Mpc the gas particle mass is comparable to the value found here for which \u039bCDM00 can be safely analyzed. However they\nhave a constant mass resolution and their cluster sample has a lower limit of M > 1014 M\u2299 .\nAn application of the numerical parameters required here to a cluster with a virial mass of\n\u2243 1014 M\u2299 would give a gas particle mass of \u2243 \u03a9b 1014 /(\u03a9m 2.2 * 104 ) \u2243 5 * 108 M\u2299 , a factor\n\u2243 30 smaller than that being used in the L = 150h\u22121Mpc simulations. These values also\nshow that cosmological simulations require a number of gas particles \u2243 (400L/150h\u22121Mpc)3\nin order to give realistic estimates for the statistical properties of X-ray clusters.\n\n3.3.\n\nSimulations with different star formation prescriptions\n\nThe numerical tests studied here give the range of numerical parameters for which the\nresults of cooling cluster simulations, including SF according to the NW prescription, reach\nnumerical convergence and can be considered stable. A different question concerning the\nreliability of the numerical results is the sensitivity of the estimated cluster properties to\nthe numerical method used to describe star formation and energy feedback from stars in the\nhydrodynamical simulations. To investigate this, final results for different simulations have\nbeen compared for a single test cluster (\u039bCDM00). The simulations were performed with\nthe same numerical parameters as for the cl00 \u2212 11 run, but using different SF methods or\nparameters. This was done in order to demonstrate the effects of the SF modelling on the gas\nvariables. A summary of these simulations with different SF prescriptions is reported in Table\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n6. The simulation with index I is the standard case with which previous cooling+SF runs\nhave been performed. Thus this simulation just corresponds to cl00 \u2212 11. Two simulation\nruns correspond to the NW method but with a different feedback energy for SN explosions\n(I and V). In the other three runs the KWH prescription was adopted for converting gas\nparticles into stars. Two of them (II and III) compare the results obtained for a different\nstar formation efficiency parameter c\u22c6 , with the other parameters being held fixed; in a\nthird run (IV) the fraction \u03b5\u22c6 of mass of the gas converted to stars is varied. The results\nof the different approaches are shown in Figures 8 & 9. For the simulation V, only the star\nformation rate (SFR) and the X-ray luminosity versus time have been plotted in the two left\npanels of Figure 8. This is because the simulation V produced final results almost identical\nto the reference case I. In simulation V the feedback SN energy was set to \u03b5SN = 1050 erg, a\nvalue ten times smaller than that of the simulation run I. A comparison between the results\nplotted in Figure 8 shows that the two simulations have an identical evolution for the X-ray\nluminosity, but a different SFR. This is because of the smaller amount of SN feedback energy\nwhich is added to the thermal energy of the gas in the run V. This in turn implies higher\n>\ngas densities and SF rates for simulation V. The differences become negligible for t \u223c\n8Gyr.\nThe final gas profiles, as well as the other variables, are identical.\nThe simulations with the KWH method and different \u03b5\u22c6 ( II and IV), give similar\nresults and show that the choice of the mass fraction \u03b5\u22c6 is not important in modelling the\nstar formation processes. The most important differences are found between the KWH\nsimulations with different c\u22c6 (II and IV). The differences are dramatic in the final X-ray\nluminosities, which differ by a factor \u2243 40. The source of this discrepancy lies in the\ndifferent gas density profiles, which have substantial differences in the cluster core regions\n<\nfor r \u223c\n100Kpc. These differences are localized at the cluster center; beyond r \u2243 100Kpc all\nof the profiles converge, as shown in the plots of Figure 8. The temperature profiles have a\npeak value of \u2243 108 \u25e6K at r \u2243 100Kpc and thereafter decline outwards by a factor \u223c 2 out to\nr200 . Below \u223c 100Kpc the profiles instead show large differences. Compared to run I (NW)\nthe two simulations with c\u22c6 = 0.1 have gas temperatures which decrease inwards by a factor\n\u223c 10 from \u223c 100Kpc down to r \u223c 10Kpc. These radial decays follow because of the less\nefficient conversion of the cooled gas into stars compared to the NW run. These results can\nbe compared with those of Lewis et al. (2000), who used the same star formation method and\nparameters, although in a different cosmology. The temperature profile of their Cool+SF\nsimulation shows a similar decrease outside of the cluster core (Fig.9 of their paper). Is is\ndifficult to compare the radial runs at r < 100Kpc because the authors adopt a linear scale\nfor the plots. The gas density profile of run II rises steeply towards the cluster center from\nr \u2243 100Kpc; a similar behavior is shown by Lewis et al. (2000) for their hot gas population\n( see their Fig.7 ). The simulation run with c\u22c6 = 1 has radial profiles much closer (but not\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nidentical) to the NW ones. These differences are also reflected in the estimated emissionweighted temperatures (see Table 6). For simulations I and III Tem \u2243 8 \u2212 9KeV , while\nTem \u2243 2KeV for run II. Note that for this simulation most of the contribution to Tem comes\nfrom within the 50Kpc cluster core.\nThere is a remarkable agreement for the ratio of the cluster mass locked into stars to the\ngas mass, which is \u2243 10% at r200 for all of the runs considered (Figure 9, bottom left panel),\nwith respect to the observational values ( Evrard 1997). Also the density profiles of the stars\nproduced are very similar. As a general rule, one can say that the global cluster properties\nare not affected by the SF prescription adopted. The source of the higher gas densities in\nthe cluster core for the simulations with c\u22c6 = 0.1, compared to what is found for c\u22c6 = 1 ,\nis in the different SFR that the two simulations use during the integration. In the top left\npanel of Figure 8 the SF rates are plotted for the different runs. The rates are plotted versus\ntime instead of redshift because otherwise final differences would have been compressed. It\ncan be seen that the simulations II and IV have a different SF histories, with respect to runs\nIII and I. At early times runs II and IV have a lower SFR than the simulation with c\u22c6 = 1.\nThis behavior is reversed after t \u2243 10Gyr (z \u2243 0.3), with simulations II and IV showing a\nsubstantial SF activity, while runs III and I have a sharp decline in their SF rates. As final\nresults, the two simulations II and IV have less gas converted to stars in the cluster core.\nAccording to KWH, in a simulation with c\u22c6 = 0.1, the collapsing gas will reach an\nequilibrium density higher than in the one with c\u22c6 = 1. This is because of the reduced\nefficiency in the conversion of the gas into stars for the simulation with c\u22c6 = 0.1, which\nimplies that gas collapse will proceed until pressure from the thermal energy of the gas is\nable to prevent further gas collapse, reaching an equilibrium at higher gas densities. This\nin turn implies higher SF rates so that, after an initial transient, simulations with c\u22c6 = 0.1\nwill have higher gas densities and SF rates compared to the c\u22c6 = 1 runs. This expected\nbehavior is what is found in the plots of Figure 8, the NW simulation giving identical results\nto the KWH run with c\u22c6 = 1. The bottom right plot of Figure 9 shows Ms (z) the cluster\nmass in stars at the redshift z and is particularly useful in analyzing differences in the SF\nhistories between different runs. The mass in stars for the NW run stops growing at z = 0.5,\nand stays flat until z = 0. The KWH simulation with c\u22c6 = 1 has a similar trend but\nwith a somewhat steeper slope in the growth of Ms (z). An important result is that the\nfinal values of the cluster mass in stars vary by only \u2243 20% from Ms \u2243 1.5 * 1013 M\u2299 . As\npreviously outlined, this shows the reliability of different SF prescriptions in reproducing\nglobal cluster properties. In the simulation results, differences between the methods arise\nin the SF rates, which are determined by different choices of the star formation efficiency\nparameter c\u22c6 . In Figure 9 for simulations II and IV, the values of Ms (z) at high redshifts\nare below the corresponding values of the c\u22c6 = 1 runs. For these simulations with c\u22c6 = 0.1,\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nMs (z) has a continuous growth and is smaller than Ms (z) of the NW run until z \u2243 0.2.\nNote that the final masses in stars for the different runs do not correspond to what would\nnaively be expected from the different shapes of the gas density profiles in the cluster core,\nMs (z = 0) being determined by the overall SF history. The SF rates of the simulations\nwith c\u22c6 = 0.1 have the expected behavior, with respect to those of the c\u22c6 = 1 runs, but the\nhigh resolution runs of the next section will show that these SF rates are depressed by the\nnumerical resolution of the simulation.\nThe emission weighted metallicity profiles at z = 0 are shown in Figure 10. Conversion\nfrom the mass fraction in metals associated with each particle to the iron mass was accomplished according to the relationship between the total metallicity and the iron abundance\n[F e/H] of Tantalo, Chiosi & Bressan (1998). The relative iron abundances Z = F e/H in\nthe radial bins were estimated from the individual iron mass of each gas particle using the\nSPH smoothing procedure. These profiles were still rather noisy, and to obtain the final\nradial profiles of iron abundance, a further smoothing was performed by considering only\nfive distinct radial bins and averaging over neighboring bins. An important result for the\nmetallicity profiles is that the simulation runs show the existence of radial gradients, with\ndecreasing metallicities as the radius increases. This is in broad agreement with observational data for cooling flow clusters (Ezawa et al. 1997; Kikuci et al. 1999; Buote 2000;\n>\nWhite 2000; De Grandi & Molendi 2001). For the simulation runs I and III Z \u223c\n0.5Z\u2299 at\n<\n>\nthe cluster center and Z \u223c 0.1Z\u2299 at r \u223c 100Kpc , with a value for the solar abundance\n>\nZ\u2299 = (F e/H)\u2299 \u2261 4.68 * 10\u22125 (Anders & Grevesse 1989). At r \u223c\n100Kpc these values\nare \u223c 1/3 of the measured abundances obtained for a sample of 9 cooling flow clusters (De\nGrandi & Molendi 2001). This deficit of iron abundance is probably due to the lack of metal\nenrichment of the intracluster medium from SN of type Ia and will be analyzed in a future\npaper, where the metallicity dependence of the cooling function will be implemented in the\nsimulations. The KWH runs with c\u22c6 = 0.1 have metallicity profiles with abundances well\nbelow the NW run, this is because of the different SF histories, with simulations II and IV\n<\nhaving a lower SFR at early times ( \u223c\n10Gyr). The KWH run with c\u22c6 = 1 has, on average,\na steeper metallicity gradient than the NW run; here again this is because of the different\nSF histories, as shown by the different growth of Ms (z).\n\n3.3.1.\n\nHigh resolution simulations with different star formation prescriptions\n\nAn important point about the simulation results related to the SF parameters, such\nas for example the SFR, is their dependence on the numerical resolution adopted. The\nnumerical tests of Table 6 have been performed with the same number of particles and\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nsoftening parameters (cl00 \u2212 11 in Table 3), and for the particle gas mass mg \u2243 1.2 * 1010M\u2299 .\nThe resolution of the mass of gas is clearly inadequate for modelling a single galaxy formation\nprocess. SPH simulations of galaxy formation processes have been debated by many authors\n(Thacker & Couchman 2000, and references cited therein). In order to resolve the internal\ndynamics and to follow shock evolution of a forming galaxy a minimum of \u2243 104 particles\nis required (Thacker et al. 2000). Lia, Carraro & Salucci (2000) discussed the dependence\nof the mass resolution on the SFR in gas-dynamical simulations of a collapsing spheroid.\nAccording to their results, the total mass of gas converted into stars diminishes from 90% to\n\u2243 80% of the initial mass of gas, passing from the low resolution run with 2, 000 particles to\nthe high resolution run with more than \u2243 104 particles. However, early simulations (Evrard\n1988, NW) showed that SPH simulations with even a small number of particles (\u2243 100) can\nconverge to stable results as far as global properties are concerned. For example Figure 20\nof NW indicates that the final mass of stars in their SPH simulations of a rotating cloud is\n>\nalready close to the convergence value for a number of gas particles Ng \u223c\n100.\nIt is therefore important to assess the effects of numerical resolution on final results\nin the simulations with different SF prescriptions. This has been done by running again\nsimulations I, II and III of Table 6 but with a number of particles increased by a factor\n\u2243 3. For the gas particles Ng = 69, 599, mg = 2.4 * 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 and \u03b5g = 10.5h\u22121 Kpc. The\ncold dark matter particles have these values scaled in proportion. These simulations will be\nreferred as IH, IIH and IIIH, respectively. The numerical parameters are those of cl00 \u2212 11H\nin Table 3. Different SF parameters correspond to the ones of Table 6. The simulation\nresults are shown in Figure 11. For simulations IH there are not appreciable differences\nin the radial profiles. This confirms the results of \u00a73.1, that the NW runs have reached\nnumerical convergence in the physical variables for the numerical parameters of the cl00 \u2212 10\nsimulation of Table 3. The profiles of simulation IIH are instead different from those of run\n<\nII at r \u223c\n50Kpc. The strong drop in T (r) has been removed and the gas density profile is\nmuch closer to the NW one. Simulation IIIH gives final profiles very similar to the ones of\nthe parent simulation. The bottom left panel of Figure 11 shows that high resolution runs\nhave final X-ray luminosities which can differ by a factor \u223c 2 from the parent simulations.\nSF rates are shown in the the top left panel of Figure 11 and at z > 0 there are large\n>\ndifferences between the high resolution run IIH and the parent simulation. For t \u223c\n5Gyr,\nsimulations IH and IIIH give the best performances, with the SF rates closely following the\nones of the lower resolution runs. Note the strong decline in the SFR after z = 0.3 . At\n<\nearly times (t \u223c\n5Gyr) the SF rates of simulations I and III are much lower than those of\nthe corresponding high resolution runs. For these runs, the peak of the SF activity is shifted\nfrom z \u2243 0.7 up to z \u2243 2 (t \u2243 3Gyr). This shows that in order to correctly sample the\nSF rate over the whole cluster evolution the numerical resolution must be at least that of\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n>\nthe high resolution runs. For t \u223c\n5Gyr, simulations I and III have cluster SF rates in good\nagreement with those of the corresponding high resolution runs, while simulation II does not\nshow that convergence is achieved when the resolution is increased. For simulations I and\nIII, the X-ray variables are not affected by the undersampling of the SF rates at early times;\nfor example, the X-ray luminosities (Figure 11, bottom left panel) are fairly stable under an\nincrease in the numerical resolution.\n\nThe results of these high resolution simulations show that in the large Ng regime, different star formation methods approach similar gas profiles. For the simulations of Table 6, the\ndifferences found between the profiles of the runs with c\u22c6 = 0.1 and the others arise because\nin the former case, with respect to the KWH run with c\u22c6 = 1, the increase in the SF rate\ncorresponding to a decrease in the value of c\u22c6 is limited by the numerical resolution. The\nupper left panel of Figure 11 shows that for the high resolution run IIH the SF rate is much\nhigher than in simulation II.\nFrom the simulation results it follows that the NW method is the most efficient in the\nremoval of cold gas from the cluster center. As already stressed, in principle all the methods\nconverge to the same profiles when Ngas gets very large. The runs with c\u22c6 = 0.1 are the ones\nwith the most important differences in the temperature profiles, compared to the other runs,\nand the reasons of these differences have been previously discussed. An explanation of why\nthe NW method is so efficient relies on the chosen criterion for selecting cold gas subject to\nstar formation, the method being based on a density threshold. If the local gas density \u03c1i\nexceeds this threshold (7.10\u221226 grcm\u22123) then a mass fraction \u03b5\u22c6 = 1/2 of the gas particle is\nconverted into a star particle. In very high density regions, the timescales of star formation\nare very short and the SF process removes the gas very quickly. Because the criterion is\nbased on a density threshold this means that all the gas particles above this threshold are\nselected for a star forming event.\nDifferences in the temperature profiles between the NW and KWH runs with c\u22c6 = 1 are\nminimal and are localized at the cluster center, these differences being due to the different\ndependence of the two methods on the resolution limit of the simulations. The two criteria of\nSF depend on the numerical resolution of the simulations through the SPH smoothing lengths\n>\n\u03b5g /4 \u2261 hmin , where \u03b5g\nhi , which determine \u03c1i and are constrained by the lower limit hi \u223c\nis the gravitational softening length. As the gas density increases toward the cluster center,\nthe smoothing lengths hi get smaller, until they reach the limit hmin . The results of the\nsimulations show that at the cluster center, in the small value regime hi \u2192 hmin , the NW\ncriterion for identifying cold gas particles is less sensitive to the resolution limit hmin than\nthe KWH method based on the local Jeans instability.\nTo summarize, the above results demonstrate that simulations I and III of Table 6 have\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nan adequate numerical resolution to reliably predict X-ray cluster properties, such as the\nX-ray luminosity. For simulation II ( KWH with c\u22c6 = 0.1 ) there are still differences at the\ncluster core between the final profiles when the numerical resolution is increased. Run IIH has\na final LX which is very large compared to the expected range of values from the luminositytemperature relation (see below). For the simulation runs I and III LX \u2243 1045 ergsec\u22121 ,\nwhile LX \u2243 4 * 1046 ergsec\u22121 for the runs with c\u22c6 = 0.1. These large discrepancies can be\nreduced by adopting the phenomenological prescription of removing from the summation (8),\ncold gas particles with temperatures below a cut-off value Tc . For the runs II and IV with\nc\u22c6 = 0.1, LX \u2243 1045 ergsec\u22121 if the above prescription is adopted with Tc \u2243 3 * 107 \u25e6K. It is\n>\nimportant to note that the NW run has an LX that shows no sign of evolution for t \u223c\n5Gyr\n<\n( z \u223c 1.2 ).\n\n3.4.\n\nComparison with observational parameters\n\nThese differences between different methods suggest that a reliable SF algorithm should\nbe chosen by requiring that simulation results should consistently satisfy a wide set of different observational constraints on cluster properties. To this end, the results of the simulation\nruns reported in Table 6 have been compared with several cluster observations. The data\ninvestigated are : the LX \u2212 TX relation for cooling flow clusters and the estimated SFR in\nrich clusters at the present epoch. These observations have been chosen because the plots\nof Figure 8 showed large differences between simulated clusters for the variables connected\nwith these data.\nFor cooling flow clusters, Allen & Fabian (1998a) have studied the relation between the\nbolometric X-ray luminosity LbX and the cluster temperature. They use ASCA spectra and\nROSAT images to construct a sample of 30 luminous clusters (LbX > 1045 ergsec\u22121 ), 21 of\nwhich have central cooling times < 10Gyr and are identified as cooling flow (CF) clusters.\nTheir best-fit relationships are derived for a cosmology with \u03a9m = 1 and h = 0.5, thus the\nvalues reported in Table 1 of their paper must be rescaled to those for a flat cosmology with\n\u03a9m = 0.3 and h = 0.7 . Allen & Fabian (1998) fit the LbX \u2212 TX relation with a power-law\nof the form kTX = P LQ\nbX , where kTX is the spectral fit temperature of a single isothermal\nmodel in KeV and LbX is in units of 1044 ergsec\u22121. The data values used are those of model\nC in Table 1, which according to the authors gives the best \u03c72 values. Thus the coefficients\nP and Q obtained here for the \u039b-cosmology are those corresponding in Allen & Fabian\n(1998) to the \u03c72 only for the entry CFs in their Table 2. The least-square estimator gives\nP = 1.97 \u00b1 0.33 and Q = 0.42 \u00b1 0.05, error bars are the one-parameter 68% confidence\nlimits, with \u03c72 /d.o.f = 1.03 and a mean gas fraction at 360Kpc of fg = 0.11 \u00b1 0.03. For\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nthe simulation runs I and III LbX \u2243 1.3 * 1045 ergsec\u22121 and the predicted cluster temperature\nis TXpred = 5.8 \u00b1 1.2eV . The error bar represents the 1\u03c3 confidence interval. The simulated\ncluster in the NW run has an emission-weighted temperature TXem = 8.3KeV and a massweighted temperature TXm = 5.6KeV . These values are consistent with those extracted from\nFigure 5 of YJS for the most massive clusters in their UJ simulations. They are also in\ngood agreement with the the values predicted from the mass-temperature relation inferred\nfrom cluster ASCA and ROSAT data (Horner, Mushotzky & Scharf 1999; Nevalainen,\nMarkevitch, & Forman 2000). For the simulation run III the values of LbX and the weighted\ntemperatures are similar to the ones of the NW simulation. Mathiesen & Evrard (2001)\nhave discussed how measurements of the intracluster medium spectral fit temperature Ts are\nrelated to Tm and showed that Ts can be considered as a nearly unbiased estimator of Tm .\nThus the values of the mass-weighted temperatures reported in Table 6 can be compared\nwith the corresponding TXpred. The simulations I and III are consistent at the 1\u03c3 level with\nthe LbX \u2212 TX relation derived from a sample of cooling flow clusters. Simulations II and IV\nhave LbX \u2243 4. * 1046 ergsec\u22121 and the predicted cluster temperature is outside the 2\u03c3 limits.\nAnother observational test is to compare for the different simulation runs the rates of\nSF with the observed mean SFR of cluster galaxies. There is now a strong observational\nevidence that star formation in a cluster environment is strongly suppressed with respect\nthat of field galaxies (Balogh et al. 1998; Poggianti et al. 1999). Kodama & Bower (2000)\nhave estimated the SF histories in rich cluster cores for four clusters, using photometric\nmodels constructed from 7 CNOC clusters at 0.23 < z < 0.43, and found a strong decline in\nthe SF rate relative to the field for z < 1. The SF histories of the four clusters are shown in\nFigure 9 of Kodama & Bower (2000). One of these clusters is Coma, for which the measured\nvalues for the mass in galaxies, hot gas and cluster total mass (White et al. 1993) are in\nthe same range as those of the simulated cluster \u039bCDM00. Thus a comparison between the\nSFR estimated from cluster simulations and the observed data can be made consistently.\nAlthough the numerical resolution of the simulations I-III is inadequate to correctly sample\nthe SFR of the galaxies in the cluster, the previous discussion about simulations IH, IIH\nand IIIH has shown that even for the low-resolution runs of Table 6, the global cluster SFR\nis roughly reproduced. Therefore the SF rates computed in simulations I-III can be used\nfor making a crude comparison with the values derived from Kodama & Bower (2000), in\norder to estimate the consistency of the simulation results for different SF algorithms with\nobservations.\nThe SF rates plotted in Figure 8 have been estimated by summing the mass of gas\nconverted into stars in time bins of size \u2206ts = 3 * 107 yr. For simulations I and III, at\nz = 0 \u2206ts << \u03c4g and the random process used to sample the distribution (3) can be\napproximated as Poissonian, thus the SFR \u2243 70 \u00b1 70h\u22122 M\u2299 yr \u22121; in fact there is only\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\none single event in the last four time bins. For simulation II, the condition \u2206ts >> \u03c4g\napplies and the SFR \u2243 330 \u00b1 110h\u22122 M\u2299 yr \u22121; the dispersion has been computed over the\nlast four bins. These values must be rescaled to the normalization adopted by Kodama &\nBower (2000), who reported the integrated rates for galaxies in the cluster cores in units\nof 1012 M\u2299 within a radius enclosing 1/3 of the galaxy population. In the simulations of\nTable 6 Ms \u2243 1.5 * 1013 is the total mass in stars , with a small scatter between different\nruns. Thus SFR(KB) \u2243 15 \u00b1 15h\u22122 M\u2299 yr \u22121/1012 M\u2299 for simulations I and III, while SFR(KB)\n\u2243 66 \u00b1 22h\u22122 M\u2299 yr \u22121/1012 M\u2299 for simulation run II. These values can be compared with\nSFR(Coma) \u2243 0.25h\u22122 M\u2299 yr \u22121/1012 M\u2299 found by Kodama & Bower (2000) for the Coma\ncluster at z \u2243 0.1. For the cosmology chosen by Kodama & Bower (\u03a9m = 0.2 and h = 0.5\nwithout a cosmological constant), at this redshift the Coma cluster has an age comparable\nto that of the simulated clusters at z = 0. Therefore simulations I and III have a cluster\nSFR which is consistent with the observed values. The simulation II, with the KWH method\nand c\u22c6 = 0.1, has instead an SFR clearly above the observed limits. For the high resolution\nruns, the cluster SF rates are above the observed limits for Coma, with simulation IH being\nmarginally consistent at a 2\u03c3 level. The Coma cluster has been chosen for comparison\nbecause it has a measured cluster SFR and the estimated values for the mass components\nmatch those of \u039bCDM00. However the Coma cluster does not show a cooling flow activity\nand the cluster SF rates of the simulations would have been much smaller if \u039bCDM00 did\nnot have a cooling instability.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper I have analyzed how the gas and X-ray properties of clusters of galaxies\nestimated from hydrodynamical SPH simulations are affected when radiative cooling is included. It has been found that in order to get reasonable results the inclusion of cooling\ncannot be decoupled from a prescription for converting cold gas particles into stars. The\nfinal results depend on the star formation prescription adopted and the numerical resolution.\nWhen the cooling gas particles are converted into stars according to the NW prescription,\nthe final cluster profiles are found to be remarkably stable under changes in the numerical\nresolution.\nThis is achieved by using for the individual SPH cluster simulations a number of gas\n<\n>\n20h\u22121 Kpc. Above this numerical\n20, 000 and a gas softening parameter \u03b5g \u223c\nparticles Ng \u223c\nthreshold, estimates of the final cluster properties can differ among different runs by a factor\n<\n\u223c 2. It must be stressed that these conclusions are valid for the cluster sample studied\nhere. As discussed in \u00a72, numerical simulations of clusters less massive than those of Table 1\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\nmust take into account the metallicity dependence of the cooling function. In this case,\nthe convergence of X-ray variables may require a numerical resolution higher than those\nconsidered here.\nIf the KWH star formation prescription is adopted, with a star formation efficiency\nparameter c\u22c6 = 1, the stability of the final results with respect to the numerical resolution\nof the simulation is satisfied for the same range of numerical parameters given above for the\nruns with the NW prescription. The KWH simulations with c\u22c6 = 0.1 have been found to give\nfinal results which are much more dependent on the simulation numerical resolution. For the\n<\nKWH runs, the final differences in the gas density profiles at r \u223c\n100Kpc are a consequence\nof the different SF histories, which depend on c\u22c6 . These differences strongly affect the Xray luminosity LX , which is then the simulation variable most sensitive to the value of\nc\u22c6 . The results demonstrate that, for the same simulated cluster, different SF algorithms\nyield final gas distributions with differences localized at the cluster center. Global cluster\nproperties, such as the total mass in stars, are robust to different SF prescriptions, while\nX-ray luminosities can differ by large factors.\nA relevant difference for the simulation runs with the NW prescriptions, with respect to\nprevious simulations, is the flatness of the profiles. For the \u039bCDM00 cluster the gas profile\n<\nshows a core radius of rc \u2243 20kpc and the temperature profile is almost flat for r \u223c\n100Kpc.\nThis is at variance with what expected for a cluster with a cooling flow, but the \u039bCDM00\ncluster has at its center a cooling time \u03c4c (0) \u2243 1/3 of the universe age tU \u2243 13.5Gyr.\nThe other two clusters which experienced a cooling flow (\u039bCDM39 and CHDM39), have\n\u03c4c (0) \u2243 1Gyr and temperature profiles which decline by a factor \u223c 2 within the \u223c 200Kpc\ncluster central regions.\nA comparison of the temperature profiles with the results of Pearce et al. (2000) and YJS\nis problematic because these authors adopt a phenomenological prescription for removing\ncold gas particles from SPH estimates. In the case of YJS the temperature profiles include\nthe cold gas population and show a steep decline at the cluster centers. The profiles of the\nCool+SF simulation of Lewis et al. (2000) can be compared with those of the corresponding\nKWH run with c\u22c6 = 0.1 and do not show inconsistencies. Therefore the profiles obtained\nfor the NW run are not inconsistent with previous simulations. The temperature profiles\nshow a decline between the cluster central regions and the virial radii, but the observational\nevidence for temperature gradients is controversial (Markevitch et al. 1998; Irwin Bregman\n& Evrard 1999; White 2000).\nTo summarize, SPH hydrodynamical simulations of clusters of galaxies with radiative\ncooling and suitable star formation algorithms have been proved to be numerically stable,\ngiving cluster X-ray properties which satisfy a set of observational constraints. An applica-\n\n\f\u2013 28 \u2013\ntion of the numerical schemes adopted to a simulated cluster sample can be used to reliably\npredict the evolution of the cluster X-ray luminosity and temperature function in different\ncosmological models. X-ray cluster surveys from the XMM mission can then provide strong\nconstraints on the allowed cosmological background parameters, by comparing cluster data\nwith simulation results.\n\n\f\u2013 29 \u2013\nREFERENCES\nAllen, S.W. & Fabian, A.C. 1998a, MNRAS, 297, L57\nAllen, S.W. & Fabian, A.C. 1998b, MNRAS, 297, L63\nAnders, E. & Grevesse, N. 1989, Geochim.

The density is in units of the critical density. The different curves are\nfor integrations with different numbers of particles and different softening parameters (see\nTables 2 & 3).

The gas is allowed to convert into stars according to the NW\nstar formation prescription (see text). The simulations are the same shown in Fig. 1, with\nthe numerical parameters reported in Tables 3 & 5. The index of the simulations is cl00 \u2212 k\nor cl39 \u2212 k, with k = j + 5 and j = 1, 5 is the index of the cooling runs in Tables 2\n& 5. The simulations with index k = 11 have the same parameters as the k = 10 runs,\nbut with the gravitational tolerance parameter \u03b8 = 1 and quadrupole corrections enabled.\nThe other simulations were performed with \u03b8 = 0.7 without quadrupole corrections. In the\ndensity plots, the lines with a steeper slope (\u2243 \u22123) show the density behavior of the star\ncomponent.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- As in Fig. 3, but for the cluster simulations shown in Fig, 2.\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\ncl00-00\n\ncl39-00\n\ncl00-05\n\ncl39-05\n\ncl00-11\n\ncl39-11\n\nCHDM00\n\nCHDM39\n\ncl00-00\n\ncl39-00\n\ncl00-05\n\ncl39-05\n\ncl00-11\n\ncl39-11\n\nFig. 5.- The cooling time \u03c4c as a function of radial distance for the four test clusters. \u03c4c\nis defined according to equation 6.

For these test\nruns, values of the numerical inputs are reported in Tables 2, 3, 4 & 5. Simulation clusters\nwith index cl00 \u2212 j or cl39 \u2212 j correspond to the following symbols: diamond j = 00; circle\nj = 01, 02; triangle j = 03, 04; square j = 05.

The test cluster is \u039bCDM00, and the simulation parameters\nare those of cl00 \u2212 11 (see Table 3). The different curves are for different SF methods or\nparameters, as reported in Table 6. The continuous line refers to the NW method, the\nothers to KWH with different c\u22c6 and \u03b5\u22c6 ( c and e in the bottom right panel). Top left: star\nformation rate as a function of time.
