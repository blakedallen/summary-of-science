We discuss physical properties and baryonic content of broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers (BLAs) at low redshift.\nThese absorption systems, recently discovered in high-resolution, high-signal to noise quasar absorption line\nspectra, possibly trace the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in the temperature range between 105 and\n106 K. The central idea is that in ionization equilibrium WHIM filaments should contain a very small fraction\nof neutral gas (fH I \u223c 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126 , typically), giving rise to weak intervening H i Ly \u03b1 absorption. Due to the\nhigh temperature of the WHIM, these Ly \u03b1 absorbers must be thermally broadened to Doppler parameters (b\nvalues) \u2265 40 km s\u22121 . It is expected, however, that also non-thermal line broadening processes, line blends, and\nnoise features can mimic broad spectral features, complicating the quantitative estimate of the baryon content\nof the BLAs. To extend previous BLA measurements we have reanalyzed archival STIS data of the two quasars\nH 1821+643 and PG 0953+415 and have identified 13 BLA candidates along a total (unblocked) redshift path of\n\u2206z = 0.440. Combining our measurements with previous results for the lines of sight toward PG 1259+593 and\nPG 1116+215, the resulting new BLA sample consists of 20 reliably detected systems as well as 29 additional\ntentative cases, implying a BLA number density of dNBLA /dz = 22 \u2212 53. Eight BLAs show associated absorption\nfrom H i Ly \u03b2 and/or O vi. The comparison between Ly \u03b1, Ly \u03b2, and O vi line widths suggests that non-thermal\nbroadening and noise features substantially affect the observed BLA b value distribution. However, it remains\nunclear whether BLAs and O vi absorbers trace the same gas phase in the WHIM filaments. We estimate that\nthe contribution of BLAs to the baryon density at z = 0 is \u03a9b (BLA)\u2265 0.0027 h70 \u22121 for absorbers with log\n[N (cm\u22122 )/b(km s\u22121 )] & 11.3. This number indicates that WHIM broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers contain a substantial\nfraction of the baryons in the local Universe.\n\n1. Introduction\nPhotoionized and collisionally ionized intergalactic gas\nmost likely makes up for most of the baryonic matter\nin the local Universe. While the diffuse photoionized intergalactic medium (IGM) that gives rise to the Lyman\n\u03b1 forest accounts for \u223c 30 percent of the baryons today (Penton, Stocke, & Shull 2004), the shock-heated\nwarm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at temperatures\nT \u223c 105 \u2212107 K is expected to contribute at a comparable\nlevel to the cosmological mass density of the baryons at\nz = 0 (Cen & Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001).

Directly observing this\ngas phase is a particularly challenging task, as the WHIM\nrepresents a low density (nH \u223c 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22124 cm\u22123 ), hightemperature (T \u223c 105 \u2212 107 K) plasma, primarily made of\nprotons, electrons, He+ , and He++ , together with traces\nof some highly ionized heavy elements. Diffuse emission\nfrom this plasma is expected to have a very low surface\nbrightness and its detection awaits UV and X-ray observatories more sensitive than currently available (see,\ne.g., Fang et al. 2005; Kawahara et al. 2005; Sembach et\nal. 2005). A promising approach to study the WHIM is\nthe search for absorption features from the WHIM in\nthe far-ultraviolet (FUV) and in the X-ray regime. Fivetimes ionized oxygen (O vi) is the most important high\n\n\f2\n\nP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\nion to trace the WHIM at temperatures of T \u223c 3 \u00d7 105\nK in the FUV regime. Oxygen is a relatively abundant\nelement and the two available O vi transitions (located\nat 1031.9 and 1037.6 \u00c5) have large oscillator strengths.\nA number of detections of intervening WHIM O vi absorbers at z < 0.5 have been reported in the literature (Tripp, Savage, & Jenkins 2000; Oegerle et al. 2000;\nTripp & Savage 2000; Chen & Prochaska 2000; Savage et\nal. 2002; Richter et al. 2004, Sembach et al. 2004; Savage et\nal. 2005; Tripp et al. 2005; Danforth & Shull 2005). These\nmeasurements imply a number density of O vi absorbers\nper unit redshift of dNOVI /dz \u2248 17 \u00b1 3 for equivalent\nwidths W\u03bb \u2265 30 m\u00c5 (Danforth & Shull 2005). Assuming\nthat 20 percent or less of the oxygen is present in the form\nof O vi (fO VI \u2264 0.2) and further assuming a mean oxygen\nabundance of 0.1 solar, the measured number density of\nO vi absorbers corresponds to a cosmological mass density of \u03a9b (O vi)\u2265 0.0022 h70 \u22121 . For the interpretation of\nthis value it has to be noted that O vi absorption mainly\ntraces gas with temperatures around 3\u00d7105 K, but not the\nmillion-degree gas phase which probably contains the majority of the baryons in the WHIM. Very recently, Savage\net al. (2005) have reported the detection of Ne viii in an\nabsorption system at z \u2248 0.2 in the direction of the quasar\nHE 0226\u22124110. Ne viii traces gas at T \u223c 7\u00d7105 K (in collisional ionization equilibrium) and thus is possibly suited\nto complement the O vi measurements of the WHIM in a\nhigher temperature regime. However, as the cosmic abundance of Ne viii is relatively low, Ne viii is not expected\nto be a particularly sensitive tracer of the WHIM at the\nsignal-to-noise levels achievable with current UV spectrographs. This is supported by the non-detections of intervening Ne viii in other high S/N STIS data (Richter et\nal. 2004). X-ray absorption measurements are very important for studying the WHIM but are currently limited in\nscope because of the small number of available background\nsources and the relatively low spectral resolution of current X-ray observatories (FWHM\u223c 500 to 1000 km s\u22121 ).\nWeak WHIM X-ray absorption by O vii and O viii has\nbeen observed with the Chandra X-ray observatory towards the quasar H 1821+643 (Mathur, Weinberg, & Chen\n2003). More recently, Nicastro et al. (2005) have reported\nthe detection of O vii absorption in a WHIM filament\nin the Chandra spectrum of the flaring blazar Mrk 421.\nIn the future, more sensitive X-ray observatories such as\nthe X-ray Evolving Universe Spectrometer (XEUS) and\nConstellation-X will be of great importance to study the\nproperties of the warm-hot intergalactic gas over the entire temperature range in both absorption and emission.\nNext to high-ion absorption from oxygen and other\nmetals, recent observations with STIS (Richter et al. 2004;\nSembach et al. 2004) suggest that WHIM filaments can be\ndetected in Ly \u03b1 absorption of neutral hydrogen. Although\nthe vast majority of the hydrogen in the WHIM is ionized\n(by collisional processes and UV radiation), a tiny fraction (fH I < 10\u22125 , typically) of neutral hydrogen should\nbe present. Depending on the total gas column density\nof a WHIM absorber and its temperature, weak H i Ly \u03b1\n\nabsorption at column densities 12.5 \u2264 log N (H i)\u2264 14.0\nmay arise from WHIM filaments and could be used to\ntrace the ionized hydrogen component. The Ly \u03b1 absorption from WHIM filaments is expected to be very broad\ndue to thermal line broadening, resulting in large Doppler\nparameters of b > 40 km s\u22121 . Such lines are generally\ndifficult to detect, as they are broad and shallow. High\nresolution, high S/N FUV spectra of QSOs with smooth\nbackground continua are required to successfully search\nfor broad Ly \u03b1 absorption in the low-redshift WHIM. The\nSpace Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) is the only\ninstrument that has provided such data, but due to the\ninstrumental limitations of space-based observatories, the\nnumber of QSO spectra adequate for searching for WHIM\nbroad Ly \u03b1 absorption (in the following abbreviated as\n'BLA') is very limited. So far, two sight lines observed with\nSTIS towards the quasars PG 1259+593 (zem = 0.478)\nand PG 1116+215 (zem = 0.176) have been carefully inspected for the presence of BLAs, and a number of candidates have been identified (Richter et al. 2004; Sembach et\nal. 2004). These measurements imply a BLA number density per unit redshift of dNBLA /dz \u2248 20 \u2212 90 for Doppler\nparameters b \u2265 40 km s\u22121 and restframe equivalent widths\nW \u2265 30 m\u00c5. The large range for dNBLA /dz partly is\ndue to the uncertainty about defining reliable selection\ncriteria for separating spurious cases from good broad\nLy \u03b1 candidates (see discussions in Richter et al. 2004 and\nSembach et al. 2004). Transforming the number density\ndNBLA /dz into a cosmological baryonic mass density, one\nobtains \u03a9b (BLA)& 0.004 h70 \u22121 . This limit is only about\n10 percent of the total baryonic mass density expected\nfrom the current cosmological models (see above), but is\nabove the limit derived for the intervening O vi absorbers\n(\u03a9b (O vi)\u2265 0.0022 h70 \u22121 ; see above). Clearly, it is of great\nimportance to extend the current sample of BLA candidates using recently obtained and archival STIS data to\nmore reliably deduce the baryonic content of the WHIM\nat low z.\nIn this paper we discuss the physical properties of\nthe BLAs in the low-redshift Universe and review the\nobservational constraints that limit the detectability of\nthese systems. Moreover, we reanalyze the high S/N STIS\nspectra of the two QSOs H 1821+643 (zem = 0.297) and\nPG 0953+415 (zem = 0.239) to search for WHIM broad\nLy \u03b1 absorption along these two sight lines (Sect. 3). We\ncombine our data with the results from previous measurements for PG 1259+593 and PG 1166+215 and discuss physical properties and baryon content of the BLAs\nin Sect. 4. A summary of our study is given in Sect. 5.\n\n2. Broad Ly \u03b1 absorption\n2.1.

Their shape would differ significantly from the\nshape of ordinary Ly \u03b1 forest lines, which are usually relatively narrow (b \u223c 25 km s\u22121 ; see Richter et al. 2004). For\npure thermal broadening and assuming a collisional ionization equilibrium, one can estimate the total hydrogen\ncontent of each absorber directly from the measured line\nwidth (b value) and the H i column density (see Sect. 2.2).\nHowever, in addition to thermal line broadening, nonthermal broadening mechanisms exist, such as the Hubble\nflow or gas flows and turbulence within the cosmic web filaments. Also unresolved line blends can produce absorption features that are broad and shallow. For the analysis\nof interstellar and intergalactic absorption lines it is therefore common to assume that the measured b value of an\nabsorption line is composed of a thermal component, bth ,\nand a non-thermal component, bnon\u2212th, so that :\np\nb = bth 2 + bnon\u2212th 2 .\n(1)\nCurrent FUV absorption line data typically have limited spectral resolution and moderate signal-to-noise ratios (S/N). This means that some of the apparently broad,\nshallow absorber candidates in these spectra may be produced by noise features, blends of multiple narrow absorption lines, and continuum undulations rather than by\nWHIM gas. To reliably estimate the baryon content of the\nWHIM from broad Ly \u03b1 absorption it is therefore necessary to assess the effects of non-thermal broadening processes and data quality issues. In the following sections we\ndiscuss these various aspects in more detail to identify difficulties for the interpretation of broad spectral features.\n\n2.2. Thermal line broadening\nIf the width of an absorption line is governed solely by\nthermal broadening (i.e., bnon\u2212th = 0), the measured b\nvalue of the line serves as a direct measure for the temperature of the gas:\nr\nr\n2kT\nT\n\u2248 0.129\nkm s\u22121 ,\n(2)\nb=\nm\nA\nwhere k is the Boltzmann constant, m is the particle mass,\nand A is the atomic weight of the element. We demonstrate the effect of thermal line broadening of the Ly \u03b1\nabsorption in Fig. 1: we model the expected shape (Voigt\nprofile) of an H i Ly \u03b1 absorption line with a constant H i\ncolumn density of log N (H i)= 13.0 for Doppler parameters b = 20, 40, 80, and 150 km s\u22121 . From equation (2)\nfollows that T \u2248 60b2 for pure thermal broadening. The\nb values of 20, 40, 80, and 150 km s\u22121 given in Fig. 1 then\ncorrespond to temperatures of log T \u2248 4.4, 5.0, 5.6, and\n6.1. Clearly, it is much easier to detect Ly \u03b1 absorption\nfrom gas with T \u2248 104 K than Ly \u03b1 absorption from gas\nwith T \u2248 106 K. The search for broad Ly \u03b1 absorption\nfrom the WHIM at temperatures T = 105 \u2212 106 K therefore requires spectral data with good S/N and a smooth\nbackground continuum.\n\n3\n\nFig. 1. Theoretical Voigt line profiles for H i Ly \u03b1 absorption with a constant H i column density of log N (H i)=\n13.0 and b values of 20, 40, 80, and 160 km s\u22121 are shown.\nFor pure thermal broadening and in collisional ionization\nequilibrium, these lines would trace gas with ionized gas\ncolumn densities of log N (H ii)= 16.4, 17.8, 19.5, and 19.8,\nrespectively.\nIf collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) applies, one\ncan directly calculate the hydrogen ionization fraction log\nfH =log ((H0 +H+ )/H0 ) \u2248 log (H+ /H0 ) as a function of\nthe gas temperature (Sutherland & Dopita 1993; Richter\net al. 2004) :\nlog fH (T ) \u2248 \u221213.9 + 5.4 log T \u2212 0.33 (log T )2 .\n\n(3)\n\nTogether with the measured H i column density, N (H i),\none can determine the total hydrogen column density via\nN (H) = fH N (H i). Under these assumptions, the chosen\nsequence of b values in Fig. 1 not only is a sequence of\nincreasing temperature of the absorbing gas, but also a\nsequence of increasing ionized hydrogen column density\n(log N (H ii) \u2248 16.4, 17.8, 19.5, and 19.8). The correlation\nbetween higher gas content and weaker H i absorption has\nimportant observational consequences if the lines are thermally broadened: the broader and shallower a WHIM H i\nLy \u03b1 line is, the more baryonic material it traces. This\nmeans that it will be particularly difficult to detect those\nWHIM Ly \u03b1 absorbers that have the largest baryon content, as many of these features may fall below the detection limit. Note that for low gas densities (nH < 10\u22125\ncm\u22123 ) photoionization by the UV background contributes\nto the ionization of the WHIM (see Sect. 2.6). Therefore,\nthe total hydrogen column density derived from equation\n(3) under the assumption of CIE has to be regarded as a\nlower limit for N (H) in BLAs.\n\n2.3. Non-thermal line broadening\nThe network of WHIM filaments represents cosmic structures at scales of a several Mpc (e.g., Cen & Ostriker 1999;\n\n\f4\n\nP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\nFig. 2. Artificial spectra of Ly \u03b1 absorption in the wavelength range between 1220 and 1240 \u00c5 are shown. The upper\npanel shows the initial synthetic spectrum (without noise) with five Ly \u03b1 absorbers A, B, C, D, and E having log\nN (H i)= 13.23, 12.28, 13.07, 13.10, 13.12 and b values of 141, 32, 24, 25, 51 km s\u22121 , respectively. The lower three panels\nshow the same spectrum with Poisson noise added at S/N levels of 50, 20 and 10 per 7 km s\u22121 wide pixel. For a\nS/N\u2264 20 the broad Ly \u03b1 absorber A almost vanishes in the noise, and the two narrow absorbers C and D start to\nsmear together to one broad spectral feature. At a S/N of 10, the broad Ly \u03b1 absorber E is affected by a noise peak and\nthus looks asymmetric. These spectra demonstrate the difficulty to reliably identify intrinsically broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\nin data with limited S/N.\nDav\u00e9 et al. 2001), while the thickness of an individual filament is expected to be on the order of several hundred kpc\n(Valageas, Schaeffer, & Silk 2003). Line broadening due\nto peculiar velocities and turbulence in the gas therefore\nmust be considered when it comes to the interpretation\nof lines widths of WHIM absorbers. Clearly, at such large\nscales the gas is expected to have density and velocity\nsubstructure that will leave its imprint in the observed H i\noptical depth distribution (Kawahara et al. 2005). These\neffects would result in non-Gaussian shapes of broad H i\nlines, which could be identified in absorption line data\nat sufficient spectral resolution and S/N. Broad H i lines\nthat are asymmetric therefore should be interpreted with\nparticular care, as their width may not represent a good\nmeasure of the temperature of the gas.\nAs spectral resolution and signal-to-noise (S/N) in\nFUV data are limited, apparently broad Ly \u03b1 absorption\nmay be caused by individual unresolved velocity components. In particular the measurements of line widths\nfrom intermediate and low spectral resolution spectra\n(FWHM\u2265 20 km s\u22121 ) often turn out to be imprecise due\nto the presence of subcomponents that are not, or only\nbarely resolved in the data. The resolution of the STIS\nE140M spectra used in this and the previous two studies\n\nis high, and with a FWHM of \u223c 7 km s\u22121 , much smaller\nthan the typical widths of the lines under investigation\n(b \u2265 40 km s\u22121 or FWHM\u2265 66.5 km s\u22121 ). At this resolution, most of the existing subcomponent structure in intervening absorbers should be resolved. Multiple absorption\ncomponents that are separated by \u223c 20 \u2212 40 km s\u22121 will\nin most cases produce an absorption structure that looks\nasymmetric and non-Gaussian. For uniformity, in this paper we concentrate on STIS E140M spectra, but we note\nthat BLA candidates have also been identified in lowerresolution observations with the STIS first-order gratings\n(e.g., Bowen, Pettini, & Blades 2002).\nIf the WHIM gas participates in the overall Hubbleflow, Hubble broadening will contribute with \u223c 7 km s\u22121\nper hundred kpc thickness of the absorber to the total line\nwidth. However, if the thickness of the absorbing WHIM\nstructures is on the order of a few hundred kpc (Valageas,\nSchaeffer, & Silk 2002), one expects that bHubble \u2264 30\nkm s\u22121 , typically. Moreover, as the WHIM is produced by\ncollapsed gaseous structures that undergo gravitational\nshock-heating, one may argue that the resulting WHIM\nfilaments primarily have decoupled from the Hubble flow\nduring the collapse phase and that the gas dynamics is\ndriven primarily by internal processes (this should be valid\n\n\fP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\nat least for the main direction of the collapse). Hubble\nbroadening therefore is not expected to dominate the\nwidths of WHIM spectral lines. For those BLAs in which\nassociated O vi absorption is observed, one can evaluate\nthe possible presence of non-thermal line broadening by\ncomparing the b value of H i and O vi. For pure thermal\nbroadening the O vi b value is expected to be four times\nsmaller than that of H i owing to the 16 times larger mass\nof oxygen (see equation 2). Non-thermal contributions to b\nmay be significant for BLA/O vi absorber pairs that have\nbH I < 4 bO VI . However, only a small fraction of the BLAs\nshow associated O vi absorption, so that this consistency\ncheck on the gas temperature can be applied only to a\nfew cases. In addition, significant velocity offsets between\nH i and O vi as well possible multi-component structure\nin the O vi are observed in some cases. It thus remains\nunclear whether the H i and the O vi absorption always\ntrace the same gas phase, and whether the comparison\nbetween O vi and H i line widths provides reliable information about non-thermal gas motions.\n\n2.4. Noise\nFUV spectral data of extragalactic background sources\nobtained with STIS typically have S/N< 30 per \u223c 7\nkm s\u22121 wide resolution element. The presence of noise\nclearly hampers the reliable detection of WHIM BLA candidates. The S/N in the data will determine the detection\nlimit of broad features and so it is clear that only the highest H i column density WHIM filaments can be detected\nwith current FUV data. In contrast to the O vi absorbers,\nthe detection limit for broad Ly \u03b1 absorption cannot easily be quantified in terms of a minimum equivalent width,\nas both the depth and the width of a line limit its detectability. For instance, a relatively narrow H i Ly \u03b1 line\nwith b = 40 km s\u22121 and log N = 13.0 (see Fig. 1, upper\nright panel) will have an equivalent width of \u223c 50 m\u00c5 and\ncan easily be detected with STIS data at a S/N\u2265 15. At\nthis S/N, however, a very broad line with b = 150 km s\u22121\nand log N = 13.0 (Fig. 1, lower right panel) would not be\ndetectable, although the equivalent width would be the\nsame. From the analysis of STIS data we find that BLA\ncandidates can be identified if the following condition is\nfulfilled:\n3 \u00d7 1012\nN (H I)\n&\ncm\u22122 (km s\u22121 )\u22121 .\nb(H I)\n(S/N)\n\n(4)\n\nIn this equation, S/N is the local signal-to-noise ratio per\nresolution element. The S/N ratio may vary significantly\nwithin a spectrum due to large-scale flux variations in the\nQSO spectrum and the wavelength-dependent sensitivity\nof the detector. The average S/N in our STIS data is \u223c 15,\nso that the typical detection limit for detecting broad Ly \u03b1\nabsorbers in these data is log (N/b)min & 11.3.\nNoise features will also influence the shape of spectral\nfeatures and thus will complicate the search for WHIM\nBLA candidates. Therefore, we have studied the influence\n\n5\n\nof noise features (Poisson noise) in a set of artificial spectra with various S/N levels. The FWHM in these spectra is similar to those in the STIS data and the pixel\nsize corresponds to one resolution element (7 km s\u22121 ).\nAn example spectrum is shown in Fig. 2. The outcome\nof our noise analysis of these mock spectra is the following: (1) noise can create structures in the continuum that\ncould be mis-identified as intervening broad Ly \u03b1 absorption, (2) noise can create broad absorption features out\nof multiple, individual velocity components that are separated only by \u223c 20 \u2212 50 km s\u22121 , (3) noise can substantially modify the shape of an existing broad absorber, so\nthat Gaussian-shaped absorption lines become asymmetric, and vice versa. The binning of several pixels can help\nto check on the validity of an absorption feature, but we\nfind that at S/N< 20 more than 50 percent of all apparent\nbroad absorption features are caused by noise rather than\nby intrinisically broad lines. Next to Poisson noise, other\nsystematic noise sources can be important for the interpretation of spectral features in FUV absorption line data.\nFor the STIS instrument, possible order-edge artifacts and\nfeatures caused by the obscuration by the field electrode\nof the MAMA detector (the \"repeller wire\"; see Woodgate\net al. 1998) have to be considered. The limited S/N in the\ncurrently existing FUV data introduces the largest uncertainty for the proper identification and analysis of BLA\ncandidate lines. Note, however, that the broad lines chosen\nfor this study currently represent the best ones available\nfor the search of BLAs.\n\n2.5. Continuum undulations\nDue to the large width and the shallowness of the BLAs,\none may argue that part of these features are not produced by intervening absorption but rather are caused\ncaused by small-scale undulations in the overlaying quasar\ncontinuum. One simple way to test for the presence of\ncontinuum undulations in the STIS data is to analyze\nthe smoothness of the quasar continuum shortwards and\nlongwards of the QSO Ly \u03b1 emission. If some of the features identified as broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers are instead produced by continuum undulations, one should expect that\nsuch undulations are distributed all over the spectrum,\nwhereas true intergalactic BLAs can occur only in the\nwavelength range between \u03bbBLA,min = 1215.67 \u00c5 and\n\u03bbBLA,max = (1 + zQSO ) \u00d7 1215.67 \u00c5. However, in none\nof the analyzed spectra do broad features (if significant\nwith respect to the ambient noise) occur at wavelengths\n\u03bbBLA,max > (1 + zQSO)\u00d7 1215.67 \u00c5. This implies that continuum undulations do not interfere with our BLA search.\nContinuum undulations also may be caused by weak\nemission lines from the QSO. Possible candidate lines\nfor the range \u03bbBLA,max < (1 + zQSO ) \u00d7 1215.67 \u00c5 are,\nfor instance, H i Ly \u03b2 \u03bb1025.7, O vi \u03bb1031.9, C iii \u03bb977.2.\nHowever, none of the BLA candidates considered in this\npaper lie close to the wavelengths at which QSO emission\nin these (and other) lines would be expected.\n\n\f6\n\nP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\n2.6. Deviations from CIE\n\n2.8. Summary: interpretation of H i line widths\n\nThe determination of fH and N (H ii) using equation (3)\nis valid only under the assumption that the gas is in\ncollisional ionization equilibrium, which may not be the\ncase in general. In fact, it is expected that for lowdensity gas (nH < 10\u22125 cm\u22123 ) photoionization from\nthe UV background becomes important, so that the ionization fraction (as defined in Sect. 2.2) in low-density\nBLAs should be higher compared to what is estimated\nfor pure collisional ionization. To investigate the influence of photoionization we have analyzed the output of\na WHIM simulation presented by Fang & Bryan (2001).\nThis simulation includes a combined (time equilibrium)\ncollisional ionization and photoionization model (hereafter\nreferred to as CIE+PH), based on ionization fractions\nfrom Mazzotta et al. (1998) and the CLOUDY photoionization code (Ferland et al. 1998). The WHIM simulation\npredicts that for T = 105 \u2212 107 K and nH = 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22124\ncm\u22123 the CIE+PH ionization fraction is (on average) \u223c 50\npercent higher than for CIE alone. If we restrict the density range to nH > 10\u22125 cm\u22123 , the CIE+PH ionization\nfraction typically lies \u223c 15 percent above the CIE estimate. This shows that photoionization is important for the\nBLAs. However, since we do not have information about\nthe actual hydrogen volume densities in these absorbers,\nwe only can notice that with the CIE assumption we probably underestimate the ionized hydrogen column density\n(and thus the baryon content) of BLAs by \u223c 15 \u2212 50\npercent. To more precisely pinpoint the role of photoionization in BLAs a more detailed analysis of broad Ly \u03b1\nabsorption in cosmological simulations is required. This\nwill be presented in a future paper (Richter et al. 2005, in\npreparation).\n\nAs there currently are only very few techniques that can\nbe used to constrain the baryon budget of the WHIM by\ndirect observations, the analysis of broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\nin low-z QSO absorption line spectra is of fundamental\nimportance for our understanding of the distribution of\nbaryonic matter in the local Universe. Every WHIM filament that contains sufficient amounts of neutral hydrogen\nwill produce a broad Ly \u03b1 absorption line, but, vice versa,\nnot every broad feature observed in FUV data is caused by\nthe WHIM. Moreover, the quantitative estimate of N (H ii)\nfrom N (H i) and b(H i) is hampered by the various alternative broadening mechanisms discussed above. Therefore\nit is clear that the interpretation of broad absorption features in FUV spectra and the determination of \u03a9b from\nBLA candidates is afflicted with systematic uncertainties.\nThis should be kept in mind for the second part of the\npaper, where we analyze BLA candidates along four lines\nof sight and estimate their baryon content.\n\n3.

However,\nour experience with automated line fitting routines is that\nbroad and shallow spectral features often are not identified by these routines, or that they are inappropriately fitted, e.g., by multiple, narrow lines. A careful re-analysis\nof these data focussed on the search of broad and shallow\nabsorption features is justified.\n\n3.2. Data analysis\nFor the data analysis of the STIS spectra of H 1821+643\nand PG 0953+415 we follow the procedures from previous\nspectral anlyses of STIS data for PG 1259+593 (Richter\net al. 2004) and PG 1116+215 (Sembach et al. 2004). From\na careful by-eye inspection of the STIS data (put onto a\nheliocentric velocity scale) we first have created a catalog of broad spectral features that represent candidates\nfor intervening broad H i Ly \u03b1 absorption (\u03bb0 = 1215.67\n\u00c5; oscillator strength f = 0.460; Morton 2003). As we\ndo not want to include absorbers that possibly are associated with the background quasar itself, we have considered only those lines that are more than 5000 km s\u22121 away\nfrom the quasar. We have omitted from our candidate list\nthose absorption features that exhibit clear evidence for\nsub-component structure, line blending, and irregularities\ndue to continuum undulations. Moreover, we do not consider broad absorption features that are part of complex\nmulticomponent absorption systems, as the width of these\nabsorbers is particularly difficult to determine. We therefore ignore hot gas that is situated in multiphase absorbers\nthat may preferentially be related to gas in the vicinity of\ngalaxies and galaxy groups. This introduces a selection\nbias in our BLA sample. Note that recent observations\nof Ne viii and O vi in a multiphase absorber at z \u2248 0.2\ntoward HE 0226\u22124110 suggest that such systems may contain significant amounts of hot gas (Savage et al. 2005). It\nis important to emphasize that our selection procedure\nis based solely on the visual inspection of absorption features in the spectrum. This method thus involves a certain\ndegree of subjectiveness for the identification of BLA candidates, in particular if it comes to the evaluation of noise\nfeatures, line asymmetries, and continuum undulations.\nAs outlined earlier, automated fitting procedures currently\ndo not represent a reliable alternative to assess the significance of broad spectral features. Therefore, we here rely\n\nExposure time\n[ks]\n25.5\n24.5\n35.5\n95.5\n\nBroad Ly \u03b1 analysis\nthis study\nthis study\nSembach et al. (2004)\nRichter et al. (2004)\n\non selection criteria based on our experience with previous absorption line data. Note that the BLA candidates\npresented in this paper have been identified and evaluated\nindependently by the various authors of this paper.\nAfter having selected a sample of BLA candidate lines\nwe have cross-checked whether these features could be\nhigher Lyman lines or metal lines belonging to other intergalactic absorption systems, and modified the list accordingly. We then checked for associated broad Ly \u03b2 and O vi\nabsorption for the BLA candidates. BLAs that show associated Ly \u03b2 absorption with b Ly \u03b2 < 40 km s\u22121 have been\nexcluded from our sample (see Sect. 4.2.1). For the final\nBLA candidate sample, the lines have been continuumnormalized. The continuum fitting was done for each line\nindividually, using low-order polynomials that fit the continuum around a line in range from approximately \u22121000\nto +1000 km s\u22121 . The base points for the polynomial fit\nwere obtained from a binned (10 pixels, typically) version\nof the spectrum to smooth out the noise in the continuum\nflux and thus to increase the reliability of the continuum\nfit. The normalized broad Ly \u03b1 candidate lines then were\nfitted with Voigt profiles convolved with a Gaussian line\nspread function that corresponds to the spectral resolution\nof the STIS instrument (FWHM\u2248 7 km s\u22121 ). As the lines\nunder analysis generally have FWHM> 50 km s\u22121 , possible small deviations of the STIS line spread function from\na single-component Gaussian have no measurable influence on the outcome of the profile fit. For the fitting procedure we have used the Voigt profile/ \u03c72 minimization\nroutine FITLYMAN installed in the ESO-MIDAS software package (Fontana & Ballester 1996), which delivers line centroids, redshifts, equivalent widths, logarithmic\ncolumn densities, b values, and their corresponding errors.\nThe total uncertainty for N and b have been calculated by\nquadratically adding the error estimates from the fitting\nprocess to those from the continuum placement. Due to\nthe fact the S/N varies over the spectrum, the detection\nlimit for BLAs, log (N/b)min , as defined in Sect. 2.4, also\nvaries across the spectrum. Many of the BLA candidates in\nour sample have a low S/N in their profile. In some cases,\nthere is weak (but not compelling) evidence for asymmetries and unresolved component structure. Although these\nsystems are all clearly detected with Wr /\u03c3 > 4.4 except\nfor one line with Wr /\u03c3 = 2.6, it is probable that some\nof them are not related to thermally broadened H i but\nare caused by blends of several subcomponents and noise\nfeatures. As the S/N in our data is not good enough to reliably evaluate the true component structure in these broad\n\n\f8\n\nP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\nFig. 3. The well-detected broad Ly \u03b1 absorber at z = 0.18047 in the STIS spectrum of H 1821+643 is shown. This\nsystem has an H i column density of log N (H i)= 13.21 and a b value of \u223c 56 km s\u22121 (see also Table 2). The shape of\nthis BLA differs significantly from the shape of the narrow z = 0.17924 Ly \u03b1 forest absorption near 1433.5 \u00c5.\nlines, we regard these absorbers as tentative BLA detections. Throughout the following we label these cases accordingly. Measured column densities, b values, and other\nquantities for each absorber in our final BLA candidate\nsample are listed in Tables 2 and 3. In Table 4 we list estimates for the temperature, ionization fraction, and total\nhydrogen column density for each system (see Sect. 4.3).\nStatistical information for each sight line is presented in\nTable 5.\n\n3.3. H 1821+643\nThe wavelength range available for detecting intervening\nbroad Ly \u03b1 absorption towards H 1821+643 (zem = 0.297)\nis from \u223c 1230.0 \u00c5 to \u223c 1556.5 \u00c5 (\u2265 5000 km s\u22121 away\nfrom the quasar), corresponding to a redshift interval of\n\u2206z = 0.269. The typical S/N in this range is \u223c 21 per\nresolution element, so that the detection limit for broad\nLy \u03b1 absorption (see equation 4) is log (N/b) \u2248 11.2.\nThe blocking of certain spectral regions due to other\ninterstellar and intergalactic lines reduces the total unblended redshift interval to a value of \u2206z = 0.238. We find\nsix reliably detected single-component BLA candidates\nat z = 0.02642, 0.12221, 0.16352, 0.18047, 0.22616, and\n0.26659. Equivalent widths, column densities, and b values for these absorbers are listed in Table 2. The systems\nat z = 0.16352, 0.18047, and 0.22616 have been previously identified as H i Ly \u03b1 absorption in lower-resolution\nGHRS G140L data (Tripp, Lu, & Savage 1998). Two of\nthese systems (at z = 0.22616 and 0.26659) show associated O vi absorption, which has been previously analyzed\nby Tripp, Savage & Jenkins (2000). For the z = 0.26659\nsystem we find associated Ly \u03b2 absorption, which is also\nbroad (b \u2248 42 km s\u22121 ). Considering all six BLA candidates we obtain a BLA number density per unit redshift\nof dNBL /dz \u2248 25 for log (N/b) \u2265 11.2. As an example\nfor broad Ly \u03b1 absorption towards H 1821+643 we show\nin Fig. 3 the spectral region between 1430 and 1440 \u00c5.\nThe BLA near 1435 \u00c5 (z = 0.18047) is clearly visible, and\n\nthere is no evidence that this feature is produced by a continuum undulation or a blend of several narrow absorption\nlines. Continuum normalized velocity profiles of all BLA\ncandidates towards H 1821+643 are shown in Fig. 4. From\nVoigt profile fitting of the Ly \u03b1 profiles we derive b values between 44 and 56 km s\u22121 and logarithmic H i column\ndensities between 13.19 and 13.65 (see Table 2 for details).\nAll the BLAs candidate lines toward H 1821+643 therefore\nare relatively narrow, which may imply that some of them\nare not related to the WHIM, but rather are Ly \u03b1 forest\nlines broadened by non-thermal processes. Our measured\nvalues of b = 45.6\u00b13.9 km s\u22121 and log N = 13.65\u00b10.06 for\nthe BLA at z = 0.26659 agree well with the numbers cited\n\u22121\nby Tripp, Savage, & Jenkins (2000) (b = 44.6+7.3\n\u22126.3 km s\nand log N = 13.62\u00b10.03) for this system. Note that we do\nnot consider here the broad Ly \u03b1 absorption found in the\nz = 0.12120 system, as this line is part of a complex multiphase absorption system with very broad O vi absorption, possibly indicating unresolved component structure\nand non-thermal broadening processes (Tripp et al. 2001).\nA complete IGM analysis of the H 1821+643 sight line will\nbe provided in a separate paper (Sembach et al. 2005a).\n\n3.4. PG 0953+415\nTowards PG 0953+415 we detect seven BLA candidates at\nz = 0.02108, 0.04382, 0.09315, 0.10294, 0.17984, 0.19142,\nand 0.19360 in the available wavelength range between\n\u223c 1220.0 and \u223c 1485.9 \u00c5 (\u2206z = 0.219). After applying\na blocking correction, the total redshift path for finding\nBLAs towards PG 0953+415 reduces to \u2206z = 0.202. The\nsystems at z = 0.02108, 0.10294, and 0.19142 are tentative\ndetections (see Table 2, last column for a more detailed\ndescription of these lines). Another broad spectral feature\nis observed near 1282 \u00c5, corresponding to z = 0.05461 for\nH i Ly \u03b1. This feature most likely is an order-edge artifact caused by the slightly imperfect ripple correction in\nthe STIS data (see Sect. 2.4) and will not be considered\nany further.

Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\n3.5. PG 1116+215 and PG 1259+593\nDetailed analyses of the BLAs towards PG 1116+215\nand PG 1259+593 have been presented by Sembach et\nal. (2004) and Richter et al. (2004), respectively. We here\nbriefly summarize and update the findings from these\nstudies. Toward PG 1116+215, Sembach et al. (2004) find\nseven BLA candidates along a total, unblocked redshift\npath of \u2206z = 0.133. We regard four of these absorbers as\ntentative detections (see Table 2, last column). With an\naverage S/N of \u223c 17, the study implies dNBL /dz \u2248 23\nfor log (N/b) \u2265 11.2 for the reliably detected systems (\u223c\n53 including the uncertain cases). Toward PG 1259+593\nthere are 29 BLA candidates along relatively long, unblocked redshift path of \u2206z = 0.355 (Richter et al. 2004).\nFollowing the selection criteria presented above, 22 of\nthese candidate BLA systems are tentative detections.\nThe average S/N in the the PG 1259+593 spectrum is 12,\nbut note that the S/N varies within a factor of \u223c 1.5 along\nthe spectrum. The number of reliably detected broad\nsystems (= 7) corresponds to dNBL /dz \u2248 20 for log\n(N/b) \u2265 11.1 \u2212 11.4 (\u223c 82 including the uncertain cases).\nColumn densities, b values and other information about\nthese broad Ly \u03b1 candidates towards PG 1116+215 and\nPG 1259+593 are listed in Tables 2 and 3.\n\n4. Properties of low-z broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n4.1. Number distribution\nThe measured values for dNBLA /dz along each individual line of sight toward H 1821+643, PG 0953+415,\nPG 1116+215, and PG 1259+593 are summarized in Table\n5. For the definitely detected systems, dNBLA /dz varies\nbetween 20 (PG 0953+415 and PG 1259+593) and 25\n(H 1821+643). If we include the tentative detections,\ndNBLA /dz ranges between 25 (H 1821+643) and 82\n(PG 1259+593). The discrepancy between the values for\ndNBLA /dz along the individual sight lines may be due\nto intrinsic scatter from the low-number statistics, possibly reflecting the peculiarities of the WHIM distribution\nalong individual sight lines. On the other hand, part of\nthe scatter may be caused by the varying sensitivity to\ndetect broad Ly \u03b1 absorption in these spectra due to the\nvarying S/N. The PG 1259+593 sight line, for instance,\nprovides a large number of tentative BLA detections in\nregions with relatively low S/N. Most likely, a fair fraction of these tentative BLA candidates are not WHIM\nabsorbers but are caused by noise and unresolved component structure. Combining these four lines of sight, we\nhave a total redshift path of \u2206z = 0.928 to detected\nBLA candidates. The comoving total path length \u2206X\nsums up to \u2206X = 1.071, as calculated from equation\n(6). Along this redshift path, the STIS data then yield\na mean value of dNBLA /dz = 22 (53) 1 for absorbers with\n1\n\n22 for the secure detections, 53 for entire candidate sample\nincluding the tentative cases.\n\n11\n\nlog (N/b) > 11.1 to 11.4, with an absorber weighted average of log (N/b) & 11.3.\n\n4.2. Identification of different absorber types\nWe can distinguish between BLAs that are detected solely\nin Ly \u03b1 and systems that show associated absorption in\nLy \u03b2 and/or O vi. Associated Ly \u03b2 and/or O vi absorption may be of great importance to gain insight into the\nphysical conditions of these systems. In our sample there\nare eight BLA systems that show associated absorption by\nLy \u03b2 and/or O vi, as indicated in Table 2, seventh column.\nIn Table 3 we summarize detailed information about these\nsystems, such as H i and O vi b values and O vi velocity\noffsets.\n\n4.2.1. BLAs with associated Ly \u03b2 absorption\nFive broad Ly \u03b1 systems in our sample have an associated\nbroad Ly \u03b2 line. For the occurrence of associated Ly \u03b2 absorption a minimum strength of log (N/b) \u2248 11.8 is required. This means that the high-column density systems\ncan be detected in Ly \u03b2, if this line falls into a spectral\nregion not blended by other ISM/IGM lines. For a thermally broadened WHIM absorber, the b value measured\nfor Ly \u03b2 should be consistent with that of the Ly \u03b1 absorption. If the b values for Ly \u03b1 and Ly \u03b2 are largely inconsistent with each other, blending effects or noise features are\nmost likely affecting the data and these systems should\nnot be considered any further. An example for this is the\nz = 0.30434 system toward PG 1259+593 (see Richter\net al. 2004, their Fig. 3f), which shows a relatively broad\nLy \u03b1 line with b \u2248 65 km s\u22121 , whereas the Ly \u03b2 absorption is narrow with b \u2248 35 km s\u22121 . For this system we\ncan conclude that blending and noise effects but not thermal line broadening determine the observed large width\nof the Ly \u03b1 absorption. This system therefore is not included in our sample. A counter-example is the BLA at\nz = 0.31978 along the same line of sight, which has a b\nvalue of \u223c 70 km s\u22121 consistent with both Ly \u03b1 and Ly \u03b2\nabsorption (Richter et al. 2004, their Fig. 3g). Along all\nfour sight lines we find nine BLAs with b \u2265 40 km s\u22121\nthat have associated Ly \u03b2 absorption, but only for five of\nthese systems is the width of the corresponding Ly \u03b2 line\nconsistent with b \u2265 40 km s\u22121 . Although our statistics are\npoor, this implies that S/N features, blending issues, and\nother processes may contaminate our BLA sample up to\na level of \u223c 50 percent. This value is consistent with our\nestimate from Sect. 2.4, where we analyzed the influence\nof noise in a set of artificial spectra.\n\n4.2.2. BLAs with associated O vi absorption\nFrom the 20 reliably detected BLAs towards H 1821+643,\nPG 0953+415, PG 1116+215, and PG 1259+593, six show\nassociated O vi absorption within a velocity range of \u00b160\nkm s\u22121 . Only a small fraction of the broad Ly \u03b1 systems is\n\n\f12\n\nP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\nTable 3.

Therefore, most BLAs arise in WHIM gas that is too\nhot, to metal-poor, or too diffuse for O vi absorption to occur at detectable levels. Some of these \"hybrid systems\"\nthat have good S/N in both Ly \u03b1 and O vi absorption\nhave been analyzed in detail with respect to their physical properties, such as temperature, ionization conditions,\nand metallicity (Sembach et al. 2004; Richter et al. 2004;\nTripp, Savage, & Jenkins 2000). Under the assumption of\ncollisional ionization equilibrium, the column densities of\nH i and O vi can be used to constrain the oxygen abundance in the gas (see, e.g., the z = 0.31978 system towards\nPG 1259+593; Richter et al. 2004). The measured b values\nfor H i and O vi also can provide information about the\ninfluence of non-thermal broadening components in some\nsystems. The comparison between broad H i and O vi absorption is often difficult, however, as the observed O vi\nfeatures do not exactly align in velocity space with the\nbroad Ly \u03b1 absorption (see also Sect. 2.4). The velocity\ncentroids of broad Ly \u03b1 and O vi in these six systems deviate by 9 \u2212 60 km s\u22121 (see Table 3). Such velocity offsets\ncould be caused by substructures within the filament. It is\nplausible that WHIM filaments are neither perfectly homogeneous (in terms of volume densities), nor are they\nperfectly isothermal (Kawahara et al. 2005). If substructures with higher densities exist, the gas may be able to\ncool, creating distinct regions where O vi absorption may\noccur preferentially once the gas reaches the peak temperature of O vi near 3 \u00d7 105 K. The radial velocities of these\ndenser spots would most likely differ from the center velocity of the entire filament, in particular if the gas stays in a\nhydrostatic equilibrium (e.g., Valageas, Schaeffer, & Silk\n2002). Cooler spots then would move towards the mass\ncenter of the filament, creating a cooling flow. Such effects\nmay lead to a non-uniform optical depth distribution of\nH i and O vi along the WHIM filament and could produce\nvelocity offsets between the integrated absorption profiles\nof these two species. It therefore remains unclear whether\nthe observed broad H i and the O vi trace the same gas\nphase.\nAlso the comparison between H i and O vi b values\nprovides information about possible non-thermal broad-\n\nb Ly \u03b1\n[km s\u22121 ]\n50.8\n45.6\n40.3\n105.0\n77.3\n42.1\n42.1\n74.3\n\nb Ly \u03b2 a\n[km s\u22121 ]\n...\n42.2\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n62.7\n\nb O VI a\n[km s\u22121 ]\n15.7\n24.1\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n19.3\n\n\u2206v O VI\n[km s\u22121 ]\n60\n9\n...\n35\n20\n48\n...\n10\n\nb H I /b O VI\n3.2\n1.9\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n3.9\n\nening effects, as outlined in Sect. 2.3. For three out of the\nsix H i/O vi absorber pairs accurate O vi b values can be\nmeasured and the resulting bH I /bO VI ratios are listed in\nthe last row of Table 3. Only the system at z = 0.31978\ntowards PG 1259+593 has bH I \u2248 4 bO VI , as expected for\npure thermal line broadening (equation 2). The systems\nat z = 0.22616 and z = 0.26659 towards H 1821+643 both\nhave bH I < 4 bO VI , thus indicating that bnon\u2212th dominates\nover bth in these systems. The large widths of the O vi\nlines could be caused by unresolved substructure, while\nthe multi-component O vi still could arise in hot gas that\nproduces thermally broadened H i absorption. Since it is\nunclear whether the broad Ly \u03b1 absorption and the O vi\narise in the same gas phase, we have to conclude that\nthe comparison between BLA and O vi line widths remains inconclusive. Two of the six broad Ly \u03b1/O vi systems occur in the line of sight towards H 1821+643. This\nsight line exhibits a overabundance of intervening O vi\nsystems compared to other low-z lines of sight (see Savage\net al. 2002; Tripp, Savage, & Jenkins 2000). However, we\nhere find that the H 1821+643 sight line is not particularly\nrich in broad Ly \u03b1 candidate systems, when compared to\nPG 0953+415, PG 1116+215, and PG 1259+593.\n\n4.3. CIE properties of the BLAs\nDespite the remaining uncertainty about the interpretation of the the observed line widths of BLAs and the uncertain contribution of photoionization, we now want to\nestimate the total gas content of these absorbers assuming the ideal case in which the lines are predominantly\nthermally broadened while the gas is in collisional ionization equilibrium. We use the measured b values and\nH i column densities from our STIS sample together with\nequations (2) and (3) to derive the total hydrogen column\ndensity, N (H), in these systems. In Table 4 we have listed\nfor each of the 49 BLA candidates values for log T , log\nfH , and log N (H). The BLAs cover a temperature range\nfrom \u223c 105 to \u223c 2.4 \u00d7 106 K for pure thermal broadening,\nand the resulting total hydrogen column densities span a\nrange from \u223c 1018 to \u223c 1021 cm\u22122 . All of the very broad\nsystems with b > 100 km s\u22121 are considered to be tentative detections (see Table 4), so that the validity of the\nhighest column density systems is particularly critical.\n\n\fP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\n13\n\nFig. 6. Number distributions of log N (H i), b, and log N (H ii) for our BLA sample are shown. The thick line indicates\nthe distribution for the secure cases, the thin line shows the distribution for the entire BLA sample.\n\n4.4. Distribution of hydrogen column densities and b\nvalues\nIn Fig. 6 we show the distribution of H i column densities,\nb values, and (estimated) ionized hydrogen column densities (N (H ii) \u2248 Ntotal ) for our BLA sample. Thin lines\nindicate the distribution for the entire candidate sample\n(49 absorbers), the thick lines indicate the distribution\nfor the secure cases (20 absorbers). The H i column density distribution (Fig. 6, left panel) peaks in the range log\nN (H i)= 13.2 \u2212 13.4. No system with log N (H i)\u2265 14.0\nhas been found, demonstrating that the neutral gas content of these absorbers is generally low. Note that for log\nN (H i)\u2264 13.0 our sample is incomplete due to the limited\nsensitivity in the lower S/N regions of the spectra. Only\na few systems are observed in this range, but it is probable that the intrinsic broad Ly \u03b1 number distribution rises\nfurther towards the low-column density end. The b value\ndistribution of the BLAs (Fig. 6, middle panel) is strongly\npeaked at b = 40 \u2212 60 km s\u22121 and shows a tail towards\nhigher b values. The b value distribution is difficult to interpret, as there are various selection effects that have to\nbe taken into account. First of all, our sample is incomplete for higher b values. Since the sensitivity to detect\nbroad Ly \u03b1 lines scales with (N/b) (see equation 4), we\npreferentially detect narrow lines rather than broad lines\nfor a given column density level. It is probable that a considerable fraction of very broad lines lie below our detection limit and do not show up in the b value distribution\nshown in Fig. 6. Secondly, if non-thermal line broadening\nmechanisms such as peculiar gas motions are important\nalso for the Ly \u03b1 forest lines, we expect to find a number\nof lines from the photoionized Ly \u03b1 shifted into the b value\nregime between 40 and 100 km s\u22121 . Such lines may significantly contaminate our broad Ly \u03b1 sample at low b values,\nwhereas the contamination should be less severe at higher\nb values. The number of WHIM absorbers with b values\nb = 40 \u2212 60 km s\u22121 shown in Fig. 6 thus may be overestimated. At the sensitivity of the current data, we should be\nable to detect very broad (b > 100 km \u22121 ) Ly \u03b1 absorption\ntoward H 1821+643, and possibly PG 0953+415 down to a\n\nlevel of log (N/b) \u2248 11.2 and 11.4, respectively. However,\nall except one of the Ly \u03b1 lines detected in these two directions have b < 100 km \u22121 . This result stands in stark contrast to the PG 1116+215 and PG 1259+593 sight lines,\nfor which several lines with b > 100 km \u22121 are found.\nDifferences in the number of very broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\nfor the four sight lines might be caused by geometrical\neffects resulting from the intersection of the cosmic web\nfilaments at different angles. If so, this would imply that\nthe line broadening is dominated by flows within the filaments or by projection effects. Alternatively, the four sight\nlines may intersect regions of the web with very different\nphysical conditions, in which case the line-width differences may be dominated by the temperature of the gas.\nDistinguishing between these two possibilities will require\nobservations of a larger number of sight lines to construct\na complete line width frequency distribution for absorbers\nin a wide variety of cosmic web environments.\nIn Fig. 6, right panel, we show the distribution of the\nionized hydrogen column density, N (H ii), as estimated\nfor each BLA candidate from equations (2) and (3) (see\nSect. 4.3 and Table 4). If our estimate for N (H ii) is at least\nroughly correct, most of the detected WHIM BLA candidates have total gas column densities between 1018 \u2212 1020\ncm\u22122 . Only three of the securely detected systems have\ncolumn densities larger than 1019 cm\u22122 , while for the\nmore uncertain cases the relative fraction of systems at\nthese column densities is significantly higher. This is because high N (H ii) systems are expected to have the highest temperatures and thus the lowest neutral gas content.\nAs these systems will be particularly broad and shallow,\nthey are most difficult to detect. Therefore, our sample is\nincomplete for total gas column densities > 1019 cm\u22122 .\n\n4.5.

For the lines of sight toward\nH 1821+643, PG 0953+415, and PG 1116+215 redshift information about nearby galaxies is available from previous\nstudies (Tripp, Lu, and Savage 1998; Savage et al. 2002).\nThese galaxy-redshift data have been obtained with the\n3.5m WIYN telescope on Kitt Peak, using the multi-object\nfiber spectrograph (HYDRA). The measurements provide\nredshift information for galaxies in a field of \u223c 1 deg2 size\naround each quasar. Unfortunately, the completeness of\nthese galaxy redshift surveys varies substantially among\nthe different sight lines, mostly due to the varying stellar\ncontamination. However, within \u223c 30.\u2032 0 of each quasar, the\nsurvey is \u223c 40 percent complete for objects with BJ \u2264 20\n(see Tripp, Lu, and Savage 1998). In Fig. 7 we compare\nthe redshift distribution of our BLA candidates to the\ndistribution of galaxies along the lines of sight towards\nH 1821+643, PG 0953+415, and PG 1116+215 within a\nradius of 30.\u2032 0 from the QSO. From a visual inspection\nof Fig. 7 it appears that BLAs are loosely correlated with\nthe occurrence of galaxies along the redshift path. One\nor more galaxies are present within a velocity radius of\n3000 km s\u22121 around each BLA candidate. However, in contrast to the O vi absorbers (e.g., Sembach et al. 2004) the\nBLAs do not appear to be significantly clustered around\nthe peaks of the galaxy-redshift distribution. This suggests that the BLAs also trace only mildly overdense\nWHIM filaments in the vicinity of individual galaxies,\nwhereas the O vi systems may be more closely related to\nhigher density gas in galaxy groups. However, we may have\nmissed broad systems that are part of more complex multicomponent absorbers, as we have restricted our sample\nto single-component systems. Since multi-component systems most likely arise preferentially in the vicinity of individual galaxies and galaxy groups due to the more complex gas distribution in these environments, our BLA sample is biased against WHIM absorbers close to galaxies\nand galaxy groups. Therefore, the observed weak correlation between BLAs galaxies may simply be a result of our\nBLA selection criteria. Additional galaxy-redshift data for\nother lines of sight (e.g., PG 1259+593) will be required\nto improve the statistics and to investigate the relation\nbetween BLAs and galaxies in more detail.\n\n4.6. Estimate for \u03a9b\nFollowing equation (5), the total hydrogen column densities derived for each of the detected BLA candidates\ntoward H 1821+643, PG 0953+415, PG 1116+215, and\nPG 1259+593 (Table 4) allow us to estimate the baryon\ncontent of the broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers. As discussed earlier in this paper, there is strong evidence that a significant fraction of the detected BLA candidates have origins other than the WHIM, and that the b-value distribution of the WHIM H i absorbers is affected also by nonthermal broadening processes. Moreover, we have shown\nthat photoionization from the UV background may significantly influence the ionzation fraction in the BLAs.\n\n\fP. Richter, B.D. Savage, K.R. Sembach, and T.M. Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\n15\n\ngen column density of log N (H)= 20.26 for the reliably\ndetected systems, and a value of log N (H)= 21.42 including the tentative systems. The total path length to detect\nBLA along the four lines of sight is \u2206X = 1.071 (see\nSect. 4.1 and Table 5). From equation (6) we then derive\n\u03a9b (BLA)= 0.0027 h70 \u22121 considering only the 20 reliable\ncases and \u03a9b (BLA)= 0.0381 h70 \u22121 for all 49 BLA candiates. Estimates for \u03a9b (BLA) for each individual sight\nline are listed in the last column of Table 5. Current cosmological models favour a value for \u03a9b of \u223c 0.045, and\nthe contribution from the WHIM to \u03a9b at z = 0 is expected to be \u223c 40 percent (e.g., Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001), so\nthat \u03a9b (WHIM)\u2248 0.018 is predicted in the local Universe.\nThe value for \u03a9b (BLA) derived from the restricted sample\ntherefore is \u223c 16 percent of the expected contribution from\nthe WHIM to \u03a9b . This is slightly higher than the contribution from intervening O vi absorbers (\u03a9b (O vi)\u2265 0.0022\nh70 \u22121 ; Danforth & Shull 2005; Sembach et al. 2004). The\nestimate from the entire BLA candidate sample, however,\nexceeds the expected value for \u03a9b (WHIM) by a factor\nof \u223c 2. The reason for this is that the by far dominating contribution to \u03a9b (BLA) comes from the very broad\nlines, which are exclusively tentative detections. The reliability of these few very broad features is very uncertain, and the unrealistically high value for \u03a9b (BLA) from\nthese systems indeed implies that a considerable fraction\nof these features probably are not related to hot gas in the\nWHIM. Note that broad lines with b \u2265 100 km s\u22121 make\nup \u223c 90 percent of the baryon content in the total sample,\nalthough they contribute only with \u223c 25 percent to the total number of absorbers. If we take non-thermal broadening processes and additional photoionization into account,\nwe believe that our estimate of \u03a9b (BLA)= 0.0027 h70 \u22121\nfrom the limited data sample represents a realistic lower\nlimit for the baryon content of broad Ly \u03b1 systems at low\nz for a detection threshold of log (N/b) \u2248 11.3.\n\n5. Summary\n\nFig. 7. Distribution of galaxies within \u223c 30.\u20320 of the direction of H 1821+643, PG 0953+415, and PG 1116+215.\nThe bins have a redshift width of \u2206z = 0.001. The redshifts of the BLAs are indicated by filled circles (secure\ndetections) and open circles (tentative detections). The\nsmaller circles indicate BLA systems with b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 ,\nthe larger circles indicate very broad systems with b > 100\nkm s\u22121 .\n\nHowever, as it is impossible to reliably quantify the contamination from these alternative processes, we now want\nto provide an estimate for \u03a9b (WHIM) assuming the ideal\ncase (i.e., without any contamination and without photoionization). Summing over the hydrogen column densities, log N (H), listed in Table 4, we obtain a total hydro-\n\nIn this paper we have studied intervening broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers at low redshifts that probably trace large amounts\nof baryonic matter hidden in the warm-hot intergalactic\nmedium (WHIM) at temperatures between \u223c 105 and\n\u223c 106 K. In ionization equilibrium a very small fraction\n(< 10\u22125 , typically) of the hydrogen in the WHIM is expected to be neutral. Depending on parameters like the\ngas temperature and the total gas column density, a certain fraction of this neutral gas should be detectable as\nthermally broadened Ly \u03b1 absorption at column densities\nlog N (H i)\u2264 14 and b \u2265 40 km s\u22121 . Given the limitations in sensitivity for detecting very broad and shallow\nabsorption features in currently existing STIS data, it becomes clear that only certain regions of the WHIM (those\nwith relatively low temperatures and high total gas column densities) can be traced with broad Ly \u03b1 absorption.\nIf the gas is in CIE and if thermal broadening dominates,\none can directly estimate the baryon content of WHIM\nbroad Ly \u03b1 absorbers (BLAs) from the measured H i line\n\n\f16\n\nP.

However, the CIE hypothesis probably is only a poor approximation for low-density\nabsorbers, so that the estimated ionization fractions are\nuncertain by up to 50 percent. In addition, the interpretation of BLA line widths is complicated, as non-thermal\nbroadening processes like peculiar gas motions, macroscopic turbulence, the Hubble flow, as well as noise features and continuum undulations potentially mimic some\nof the broad absorption features attributed to the WHIM.\nTherefore, every WHIM filament that contains sufficient\namounts of neutral hydrogen will produce broad Ly \u03b1 absorption, but conversely, not every broad spectral feature\nobserved in QSO spectra is related to the WHIM. Due\nto the non-thermal broadening processes, we expect that\nthe error rate for detecting the WHIM with broad Ly \u03b1\nabsorption may be as high as 50 percent and that for true\nWHIM BLAs the baryon content may be overestimated\nwhen relying solely on the observed b value distribution.\nHowever, it is clear that BLA systems represent an important baryon reservoir in the local Universe. Thus, their\nfrequency in high-resolution QSO spectra and their physical properties should be studied to the greatest extent\npossible.\nOur analysis of the two STIS spectra of H 1821+643\nand PG 0953+415 has resulted in the detection of 14\nbroad Ly \u03b1 absorber candidates with 12.88 \u2264 log N (H i)\u2264\n13.91 and 40 \u2264 b \u2264 122 km s\u22121 along a total (unblocked) redshift path of \u2206z = 0.440. These measurements complement previous analyses of broad Ly \u03b1 absorption towards PG 1259+593 (Richter et al. 2004) and\nPG 1116+215 (Sembach et al. 2004). Considering all four\nlines of sight, we find 20 reliably detected BLA systems\nand additional 29 tentative cases along a total redshift\npath of \u2206z = 0.928. With 20 (49) detected BLA candidate systems, the number of systems per unit redshift is\ndNBLA /dz = 22 (53). Most of these systems have H i column densities between log N = 13.0 \u2212 13.6 and b values 40 \u2264 b \u2264 100 km s\u22121 . Assuming CIE and pure thermal line broadening, the total hydrogen column density in\nthese absorbers typically ranges between log N = 18 \u2212 20.\nUnfortunately, most of the systems that have relatively\nhigh total hydrogen column densities log N \u2265 19 (and\n\nthus the largest baryon content) belong to the tentative\ndetections, and thus are highly uncertain.\nFive of the stronger BLA systems show associated\nbroad Ly \u03b2 absorption. The presence of broad Ly \u03b2 is of\ngreat help to assure that the H i absorption in these systems is indeed intrinsically broad and not caused by noise\nfeatures and continuum undulations. Six BLA candidate\nsystems show associated O vi absorption. In all cases, the\nO vi absorption shows a velocity offset compared to the\nH i absorption. Moreover, in two out of three cases the\nmeasured O vi b values are incompatible with the b values measured for H i, possibly implying unresolved component structure and non-thermal line broadening. However,\nas it is not clear whether or not the BLAs and the O vi\nsystems trace the same gas phase, the comparison between these two WHIM absorber types remains inconclusive. If we consider only the 20 reliably detected BLA\ncandidates, their baryon content sums up to a value of\n\u03a9b (BLA)= 0.0027 h70 \u22121 (assuming CIE), which is \u223c 16\npercent of what is expected to be the contribution of the\nWHIM to \u03a9b at z = 0 and about 30 percent more than\nwhat is estimated for intervening O vi systems. If we include the tentative detections we derive a high value for\n\u03a9b (BLA) of 0.0381 h70 \u22121 , suggesting that a fair number\nof these tentative detections are not related to hot gas in\nthe WHIM but rather are caused by noise features and\nnon-thermal line broadening. These findings demonstrate\nthat it is quite difficult to exactly pinpoint the baryon\nbudget of the BLAs with currently existing STIS data.\nNext to the BLAs that are not related to the WHIM, the\npossible overestimate of \u03a9b (BLA) due to non-thermal line\nbroadening and, conversely, the possible underestimate of\n\u03a9b (BLA) due to photoionization effects further complicate the situation. However, we believe that the value of\n\u03a9b (BLA)= 0.0027 h70 \u22121 is a reliable lower limit for the\nbaryon content of BLAs that lie above a detection limit\nof log (N/b) \u2248 11.3. Our study therefore suggests that\nbroad Ly \u03b1 absorbers arising in WHIM filaments contain\na significant fraction of the baryons at z = 0.\nThe BLAs represent an excellent way of studying the\nbaryonic content of WHIM gas in the temperature range\nfrom 105 to 106 K.

Tripp: Broad Ly \u03b1 absorbers\n\nnon-thermal broadening components and the uncertain\nrole of photoionization, the fact that the baryon-content\nestimate does not require knowledge of the metallicity of\nthe gas is a major advantage for using the BLAs when\ndetermining the distribution and baryonic content of the\nWHIM. A better understanding of these systems will require additional high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic\nobservations and detailed comparisons with models of the\nhydrodynamical evolution of the gas. Observations of the\nBLAs with the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins\nSpectrograph (HST/COS) and future ultraviolet spectroscopic facilities may be the only direct way of probing\nlow-metallicity regions in the cosmic web. Comparing the\nfrequency of observed BLAs with values of dN/dz predicted by the simulations would help to constrain the hot\ngas content of the web and test the importance of WHIM\nheat sources other than gravitational collapse of the web\nfilaments (i.e., galactic feedback by supernovae). Next to\nthe important future X-ray observations of the WHIM\nin emission and absorption, spectral imaging of the Ly \u03b1\nemission over large enough fields of view to quantify the\nmorphology of the WHIM gas would provide strong tests\nof the formation of large-scale gas structures and their\nrelationship to galaxies. The WHIM Ly \u03b1 and metal-line\nemission is expected to be faint but could be observed\nwith a moderate cost observatory designed for such an investigation (see Sembach et al. 2005b for one such mission\nconcept).\nAcknowledgements.
