The WMAP full-sky maps of the temperature and polarization anisotropy in five frequency bands provide our most accurate view to date of conditions\nin the early universe. The multi-frequency data facilitate the separation of the CMB signal\nfrom foreground emission arising both from our Galaxy and from extragalactic sources. The\nCMB angular power spectrum derived from these maps exhibits a highly coherent acoustic\npeak structure which makes it possible to extract a wealth of information about the composition and history of the universe, as well as the processes that seeded the fluctuations.\nWMAP data (Bennett et al. 2003; Spergel et al. 2003; Hinshaw et al. 2007; Spergel et al.\n2007), along with a host of pioneering CMB experiments (Miller et al. 1999; Lee et al.\n2001; Netterfield et al. 2002; Halverson et al. 2002; Pearson et al. 2003; Scott et al. 2003;\nBeno\u0131\u0302t et al. 2003), and other cosmological measurements (Percival et al. 2001; Tegmark et al.\n2004; Cole et al. 2005; Tegmark et al. 2006; Eisenstein et al. 2005; Percival et al. 2007; Astier et al.\n2006; Riess et al. 2007; Wood-Vasey et al. 2007) have established \u039bCDM as the standard\nmodel of cosmology: a flat universe dominated by dark energy, supplemented by dark matter\nand atoms with density fluctuations seeded by a Gaussian, adiabatic, nearly scale invariant\nprocess. The basic properties of this universe are determined by five numbers: the density of\nmatter, the density of atoms, the age of the universe (or equivalently, the Hubble constant\ntoday), the amplitude of the initial fluctuations, and their scale dependence.\nBy accurately measuring the first few peaks in the angular power spectrum and the\nlarge-scale polarization anisotropy, WMAP data have enabled the following inferences:\n\u2022 A precise (3%) determination of the density of atoms in the universe. The agreement\nbetween the atomic density derived from WMAP and the density inferred from the\ndeuterium abundance is an important test of the standard big bang model.\n\u2022 A precise (3%) determination of the dark matter density. (With five years of data\nand a better determination of our beam response, this measurement has improved\nsignificantly.) Previous CMB measurements have shown that the dark matter must\nbe non-baryonic and interact only weakly with atoms and radiation. The WMAP\nmeasurement of the density puts important constraints on supersymmetric dark matter\nmodels and on the properties of other dark matter candidates.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\u2022 A definitive determination of the acoustic scale at redshift z = 1090. Similarly, the recent measurement of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the galaxy power spectrum\n(Eisenstein et al. 2005) has determined the acoustic scale at redshift z \u223c 0.35. When\ncombined, these standard rulers accurately measure the geometry of the universe and\nthe properties of the dark energy. These data require a nearly flat universe dominated\nby dark energy consistent with a cosmological constant.\n\u2022 A precise determination of the Hubble Constant, in conjunction with BAO observations. Even when allowing curvature (\u03a90 6= 1) and a free dark energy equation of\nstate (w 6= \u22121), the acoustic data determine the Hubble constant to within 3%. The\nmeasured value is in excellent agreement with independent results from the Hubble\nKey Project (Freedman et al. 2001), providing yet another important consistency test\nfor the standard model.\n\u2022 Significant constraint of the basic properties of the primordial fluctuations. The anticorrelation seen in the temperature/polarization (TE) correlation spectrum on 4\u25e6 scales\nimplies that the fluctuations are primarily adiabatic and rule out defect models and\nisocurvature models as the primary source of fluctuations (Peiris et al. 2003).\nFurther, the WMAP measurement of the primordial power spectrum of matter fluctuations constrains the physics of inflation, our best model for the origin of these fluctuations.\nSpecifically, the 5 year data provide the best measurement to date of the scalar spectrum's\namplitude and slope, and place the most stringent limits to date on the amplitude of tensor\nfluctuations. However, it should be noted that these constraints assume a smooth function of\nscale, k. Certain models with localized structure in P (k), and hence additional parameters,\nare not ruled out, but neither are they required by the data; see e.g. Shafieloo & Souradeep\n(2007); Hunt & Sarkar (2007).\nThe statistical properties of the CMB fluctuations measured by WMAP are close to\nGaussian; however, there are several hints of possible deviations from Gaussianity, e.g.\nEriksen et al. (2007a); Copi et al. (2007); Land & Magueijo (2007); Yadav & Wandelt (2008).\nSignificant deviations would be a very important signature of new physics in the early universe.\nLarge-angular-scale polarization measurements currently provide our best window into\nthe universe at z \u223c 10. The WMAP data imply that the universe was reionized long\nbefore the epoch of the oldest known quasars. By accurately constraining the optical depth\nof the universe, WMAP not only constrains the age of the first stars but also determines\nthe amplitude of primordial fluctuations to better than 3%. This result is important for\nconstraining the growth rate of structure.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nThis paper summarizes results compiled from 5 years of WMAP data that are fully\npresented in a suite of 7 papers (including this one). The new results improve upon previous results in many ways: additional data reduces the random noise, which is especially\nimportant for studying the temperature signal on small angular scales and the polarization\nsignal on large angular scales; five independent years of data enable comparisons and null\ntests that were not previously possible; the instrument calibration and beam response have\nbeen much better characterized, due in part to improved analyses and to additional years of\ndata; and, other cosmological data have become available.\nIn addition to summarizing the other papers, this paper reports on changes in the\nWMAP data processing pipeline, presents the 5 year temperature and polarization maps,\nand gives new results on instrument calibration and on potential systematic errors in the\npolarization data. Hill et al. (2008) discuss the program to derive an improved physical optics\nmodel of the WMAP telescope, and use the results to better determine the WMAP beam\nresponse. Gold et al. (2008) present a new analysis of diffuse foreground emission in the\nWMAP data and update previous analyses using 5 year data. Wright et al. (2008) analyze\nextragalactic point sources and provide an updated source catalog, with new results on source\nvariability. Nolta et al. (2008) derive the angular power spectra from the maps, including the\nTT, TE, TB, EE, EB, and BB spectra. Dunkley et al. (2008) produce an updated likelihood\nfunction and present cosmological parameter results based on 5 year WMAP data. They\nalso develop an independent analysis of polarized foregrounds and use those results to test\nthe reliability of the optical depth inference to foreground removal errors. Komatsu et al.\n(2008) infer cosmological parameters by combining 5 year WMAP data with a host of other\ncosmological data and discuss the implications of the results. Concurrent with the submission\nof these papers, all 5 year WMAP data are made available to the research community via\nNASA's Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA). The data\nproducts are described in detail in the WMAP Explanatory Supplement (Limon et al. 2008),\nalso available on LAMBDA.\nThe WMAP instrument is composed of 10 differencing assemblies (DAs) spanning 5\nfrequencies from 23 to 94 GHz (Bennett et al. 2003): 1 DA each at 23 GHz (K1) and 33\nGHz (Ka1), 2 each at 41 GHz (Q1,Q2) and 61 GHz (V1,V2), and 4 at 94 GHz (W1-W4).\nEach DA is formed from two differential radiometers which are sensitive to orthogonal linear\npolarization modes; the radiometers are designated 1 or 2 (e.g., V11 or W12) depending on\npolarization mode.\nIn this paper we follow the notation convention that flux density is S \u223c \u03bd \u03b1 and antenna\ntemperature is T \u223c \u03bd \u03b2 , where the spectral indices are related by \u03b2 = \u03b1 \u2212 2. In general, the\nCMB is expressed in terms of thermodynamic temperature, while Galactic and extragalactic\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nforegrounds are expressed in antenna temperature. Thermodynamic temperature differences\nare given by \u2206T = \u2206TA [(ex \u2212 1)2 /x2 ex ], where x = h\u03bd/kT0 , h is the Planck constant, \u03bd\nis the frequency, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T0 = 2.725 K is the CMB temperature\n(Mather et al. 1999). A WMAP band-by-band tabulation of the conversion factors between\nthermodynamic and antenna temperature is given in Table 1.\n\n2.\n\nCHANGES IN THE 5 YEAR DATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe 1 year and 3 year data analyses were described in detail in previous papers. In large\npart, the 5 year analysis employs the same methods, so we do not repeat a detailed processing\ndescription here. However, we have made several improvements that are summarized here\nand described in more detail later in this paper and in a series of companion papers, as\nnoted. We list the changes in the order they appear in the processing pipeline:\n\u2022 There is a \u223c 1\u2032 temperature-dependent pointing offset between the star tracker coordinate system (which defines spacecraft coordinates) and the instrument boresights. In\nthe 3 year analysis we introduced a correction to account for the elevation change of\nthe instrument boresights in spacecraft coordinates. With additional years of data, we\nhave been able to refine our thermal model of the pointing offset, so we now include\na small (<1\u2032 ) correction to account for the azimuth change of the instrument boresights. Details of the new correction are given in the 5 year Explanatory Supplement\n(Limon et al. 2008).\n\u2022 We have critically re-examined the relative and absolute intensity calibration procedures, paying special attention to the absolute gain recovery obtainable from the modulation of the CMB dipole due to WMAP's motion. We describe the revised procedure\nin \u00a74 and note that the sky map calibration uncertainty has decreased from 0.5% to\n0.2%.\n\u2022 The WMAP beam response has now been measured in 10 independent \"seasons\" of\nJupiter observations. In the highest resolution W band channels, these measurements\nnow probe the beam response \u223c44 dB down from the beam peak. However, there is still\nnon-negligible beam solid angle below this level (\u223c0.5%) that needs to be measured to\nenable accurate cosmological inference. In the 3 year analysis we produced a physical\noptics model of the A-side beam response starting with a pre-flight model and fitting\nin-flight mirror distortions to the flight Jupiter data. In the 5 year analysis we have\nextended the model to the B-side optics and, for both sides, we have extended the\nfit to include distortion modes a factor of 2 smaller in linear scale (4 times as many\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nmodes). The model is used to augment the flight beam maps below a given threshold.\nThe details of this work are given in Hill et al. (2008).\n\u2022 The far sidelobe response of the beam was determined from a combination of ground\nmeasurements and in-flight lunar data taken early in the mission (Barnes et al. 2003).\nFor the current analysis, we have replaced a small fraction of the far sidelobe data with\nthe physical optics model described above. We have also made the following changes\nin our handling of the far sidelobe pickup (Hill et al. 2008): 1) We have enlarged the\n\"transition radius\" that defines the boundary between the main beam and the far\nsidelobe response. This places a larger fraction of the total beam solid angle in the\nmain beam where uncertainties are easier to quantify and propagate into the angular\npower spectra. 2) We have moved the far sidelobe deconvolution into the combined\ncalibration and sky map solver (\u00a74). This produces a self-consistent estimate of the\nintensity calibration and the deconvolved sky map. The calibrated time-ordered data\narchive has had an estimate of the far sidelobe response subtracted from each datum\n(as it had in the 3 year processing).\n\u2022 We have updated the optimal filters used in the final step of map-making. The functional form of the filter is unchanged (Jarosik et al. 2007), but the fits have been\nupdated to cover years 4 and 5 of the flight data.\n\u2022 Each WMAP differencing assembly consists of two radiometers that are sensitive to\northogonal linear polarization states. The sum and difference of the two radiometer channels split the signal into intensity and polarization components, respectively.\nHowever, the noise levels in the two radiometers are not equal, in general, so more\noptimal sky map estimation is possible in theory, at the cost of mixing intensity and\npolarization components in the process. For the current analysis, we investigated one\nsuch weighted algorithm and found that the polarization maps were subject to unacceptable contamination by the intensity signal in cases where the beam response was\nnon-circular and the gradient of the intensity signal was large, e.g., in K band. As a\nresult, we reverted to the unweighted (and unbiased) estimator used in previous work.\n\u2022 We have improved the sky masks used to reject foreground contamination. In previous\nwork, we defined masks based on contours of the K band data. In the 5 year analysis\nwe produce masks based jointly on K band and Q band contours. For a given sky cut\nfraction, the new masks exclude flat spectrum (e.g. free-free) emission more effectively.\nThe new masks are described in detail in Gold et al. (2008) and are provided with the\n5 year data release. In addition, we have modified the \"processing\" mask used to\nexclude very bright sources during sky map estimation. The new mask is defined in\nterms of low-resolution (r4) HEALPix sky pixels (Gorski et al. 2005) to facilitate a\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ncleaner definition of the pixel-pixel inverse covariance matrices, N \u22121 . One side effect\nof this change is to introduce a few r4-sized holes around the brightest radio sources\nin the analysis mask, which incorporates the processing mask as a subset.\n\u2022 We have amended our foreground analysis in the following ways: 1) Gold et al. (2008)\nperform a pixel-by-pixel analysis of the joint temperature and polarization data to\nstudy the breakdown of the Galactic emission into physical components. 2) We have\nupdated some aspects of the Maximum Entropy (MEM) based analysis, as described\nin Gold et al. (2008). 3) Dunkley et al. (2008) develop a new analysis of polarized\nforeground emission using a Gibbs sampling approach that yields a cleaned CMB polarization map and an associated covariance matrix. 4) Wright et al. (2008) update\nthe WMAP point source catalog and present some results on variable sources in the 5\nyear data. However, the basic cosmological results are still based on maps that were\ncleaned with the same template-based procedure that was used in the 3 year analysis.\n\u2022 We have improved the final temperature power spectrum, ClT T , by using a Gibbsbased maximum likelihood estimate for l \u2264 32 (Dunkley et al. 2008) and a pseudo-Cl\nestimate for higher l (Nolta et al. 2008). As with the 3 year analysis, the pseudo-Cl\nestimate uses only V- and W-band data. With 5 individual years of data and six Vand W-band differencing assemblies, we can now form individual cross-power spectra\nfrom 15 DA pairs within each of 5 years and from 36 DA pairs across 10 year pairs,\nfor a total of 435 independent cross-power spectra.\n\u2022 In the 3 year analysis we developed a pseudo-Cl method for evaluating polarization\npower spectra in the presence of correlated noise. In the present analysis we additionally estimate the TE, TB, EE, EB, & BB spectra and their errors using an extension\nof the maximum likelihood method in Page et al. (2007). However, as in the 3 year\nanalysis, the likelihood of a given model is still evaluated directly from the polarization\nmaps using a pixel-based likelihood.\n\u2022 We have improved the form of the likelihood function used to infer cosmological parameters from the Monte Carlo Markov Chains (Dunkley et al. 2008). We use an exact\nmaximum likelihood form for the l \u2264 32 TT data (Eriksen et al. 2007c). We have\ninvestigated theoretically optimal methods for incorporating window function uncertainties into the likelihood, but in tests with simulated data we have found them to\nbe biased. In the end, we adopt the form used in the 3 year analysis (Hinshaw et al.\n2007), but we incorporate the smaller 5 year window function uncertainties (Hill et al.\n2008) as inputs. We now routinely account for gravitational lensing when assessing\nparameters, and we have added an option to use low-l TB and EB data for testing\nnon-standard cosmological models.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\u2022 For testing nongaussianity, we employ an improved estimator for fN L (Creminelli et al.\n2006; Yadav et al. 2007). The results of this analysis are described in Komatsu et al.\n(2008).\n\n3.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND MAPS\n\nThe 5 year WMAP data encompass the period from 00:00:00 UT, 10 August 2001 (day\nnumber 222) to 00:00:00 UT, 9 August 2006 (day number 222). The observing efficiency\nduring this time is roughly 99%; Table 2 lists the fraction of data that was lost or rejected\nas unusable. The Table also gives the fraction of data that is flagged due to potential\ncontamination by thermal emission from Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These\ndata are not used in map-making, but are useful for in-flight beam mapping (Hill et al. 2008;\nLimon et al. 2008).\nAfter performing an end-to-end analysis of the instrument calibration, single-year sky\nmaps are created from the time-ordered data using the procedure described by Jarosik et al.\n(2007). Figure 1 shows the 5 year temperature maps at each of the five WMAP observing\nfrequencies: 23, 33, 41, 61, and 94 GHz. The number of independent observations per pixel,\nNobs , is qualitatively the same as Figure 2 of Hinshaw et al. (2007) and is not reproduced\n\u22121/2\nhere. The noise per pixel, p, is given by \u03c3(p) = \u03c30 Nobs (p), where \u03c30 is the noise per\nobservation, given in Table 1. To a very good approximation, the noise per pixel in the 5\n\u221a\nyear maps is a factor of 5 times lower than in the single-year maps. Figures 2 and 3 show\nthe 5 year polarization maps in the form of the Stokes parameters Q and U, respectively.\nMaps of the relative polarization sensitivity, the Q and U analogs of Nobs , are shown in\nFigure 13 of Jarosik et al. (2007) and are not updated here. A description of the lowresolution pixel-pixel inverse covariance matrices used in the polarization analysis is also\ngiven in Jarosik et al. (2007), and is not repeated here. The polarization maps are dominated\nby foreground emission, primarily synchrotron emission from the Milky Way. Figure 4 shows\nthe\np polarization maps in a form in which the color scale represents polarized intensity, P =\nQ2 + U 2 , and the line segments indicate polarization direction for pixels with a signal-tonoise ratio greater than 1. As with the temperature maps, the noise per pixel in the 5 year\n\u221a\npolarization maps is 5 times lower than in the single-year maps.\nFigure 5 shows the difference between the 5 year temperature maps and the corresponding 3 year maps. All maps have been smoothed to 2\u25e6 resolution to minimize the noise\ndifference between them (due to the additional years of data). The left column shows the\ndifference without any further processing, save for the subtraction of a relative offset between\nthe maps. Table 3 gives the value of the relative offset in each band. Recall that WMAP is\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ninsensitive to absolute temperature, so we adopt a convention that sets the zero level in each\nmap based on a model of the foreground emission at the galactic poles. While we have not\nchanged conventions, our 3 year estimate was erroneous due to the use of a preliminary CMB\nsignal map at the time the estimate was made. This error did not affect any cosmological\nresults, but it probably explains the offset differences noted by Eriksen et al. (2007b) in their\nrecent analysis of the 3 year data.\nThe dominant structure in the left column of Figure 5 consists of a residual dipole and\ngalactic plane emission. This reflects the updated 5 year calibration which has produced\nchanges in the gain of order 0.3% compared to the 3 year gain estimate (see \u00a74 for a more\ndetailed discussion of the calibration). Table 3 gives the dipole amplitude difference in\neach band, along with the much smaller quadrupole and octupole power difference. (For\ncomparison, we estimate the CMB power at l = 2, 3 to be l(l + 1)Cl /2\u03c0 = 211, 1041 \u03bcK2 ,\nrespectively.) The right column of Figure 5 shows the corresponding sky map differences\nafter the 3 year map has been rescaled by a single factor (in each band) to account for\nthe mean gain change between the 3 and 5 year calibration determinations. The residual\ngalactic plane structure in these maps is less than 0.2% of the nominal signal in Q band,\nand less than 0.1% in all the other bands. The large scale structure in the band-averaged\ntemperature maps is quite robust.\n\n3.1.\n\nCMB Dipole\n\nThe dipole anisotropy stands apart from the rest of the CMB signal due to its large\namplitude and to the understanding that it arises from our peculiar motion with respect to\nthe CMB rest frame. In this section we present CMB dipole results based on a new analysis\nof the 5 year sky maps. Aside from an absolute calibration uncertainty of 0.2% (see \u00a74), the\ndominint source of uncertainty in the dipole estimate arises from uncertainties in Galactic\nforeground subtraction. Here we present results for two different removal methods: templatebased cleaning and an internal linear combination (ILC) of the WMAP multifrequency data\n(Gold et al. 2008). Our final results are based on a combination of these methods with\nuncertainties that encompass both approaches.\nWith template-based foreground removal, we can form cleaned maps for each of the 8\nhigh frequency DA's, Q1-W4, while the ILC method produces one cleaned map from a linear\ncombination of all the WMAP frequency bands. We analyze the residual dipole moment in\neach of these maps (a nominal dipole based on the 3 year data is subtracted from the timeordered data prior to map-making) using a Gibbs sampling technique which generates an\nensemble of full-sky CMB realizations that are consistent with the data, as detailed below.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nWe evaluate the dipole moment of each full-sky realization and compute uncertainties from\nthe scatter of the realizations.\nWe prepared the data for the Gibbs analysis as follows. The Nside = 512, templatecleaned maps were zeroed within the KQ85 mask, smoothed with a 10\u25e6 FWHM Gaussian\nkernel, and degraded to Nside = 16. Zeroing the masked region prior to smoothing prevents\nresidual cleaning errors within the mask from contaminating the unmasked data. We add\nrandom white noise (12 \u03bcK rms per pixel) to each map to regularize the pixel-pixel covariance\nmatrix. The Nside = 512 ILC map was also smoothed with a 10\u25e6 FWHM Gaussian kernel\nand degraded to Nside = 16, but the data within the sky mask were not zeroed prior to\nsmoothing. We add white noise of 6 \u03bcK per pixel to the smoothed ILC map to regularize\nits covariance matrix. Note that smoothing the data with a 10\u25e6 kernel reduces the residual\ndipole in the maps by \u223c0.5%. We ignore this effect since the residual dipole is only \u223c0.3%\nof the full dipole amplitude to start with.\nThe Gibbs sampler was run for 10,000 steps for each of the 8 template-cleaned maps\n(Q1-W4) and for each of 6 independent noise realizations added to the ILC map. In both\ncases we applied the KQ85 mask to the analysis and truncated the CMB power at lmax = 32.\nThe resulting ensembles of 80,000 and 60,000 dipole samples were analyzed independently\nand jointly. The results of this analysis are given in Table 4. The first row combines the\nresults from the template-cleaned DA maps; the scatter among the 8 DA's was well within\nthe noise scatter for each DA, so the Gibbs samples for all 8 DA's were combined for this\nanalysis. The results for the ILC map are shown in the second row. The two methods\ngive reasonably consistent results, however, the Galactic longitude of the two dipole axis\nestimates differ from each other by about 2\u03c3. Since we cannot reliably identify one cleaning\nmethod to be superior to the other, we have merged the Gibbs samples from both methods to\nproduce the conservative estimate shown in the bottom row. This approach, which enlarges\nthe uncertainty to emcompass both estimates, gives\n(d, l, b) = (3.355 \u00b1 0.008 mK, 263.99\u25e6 \u00b1 0.14\u25e6 , 48.26\u25e6 \u00b1 0.03\u25e6 ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the amplitude estimate includes the 0.2% absolute calibration uncertainty. Given the\nCMB monopole temperature of 2.725 K (Mather et al. 1999), this amplitude implies a Solar\nSystem peculiar velocity of 369.0 \u00b1 0.9 km s\u22121 with respect to the CMB rest frame.\n4.\n\nCALIBRATION IMPROVEMENTS\n\nWith the 5 year processing we have refined our procedure for evaluating the instrument\ncalibration, and have improved our estimates for the calibration uncertainty. The funda-\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nmental calibration source is still the dipole anisotropy induced by WMAP's motion with\nrespect to the CMB rest frame (Hinshaw et al. 2003; Jarosik et al. 2007), but several details\nof the calibration fitting have been modified. The new calibration solution is consistent with\nprevious results in the overlapping time range. We estimate the uncertainty in the absolute\ncalibration is now 0.2% per differencing assembly.\nThe basic calibration procedure posits that a single channel of time-ordered data, di ,\nmay be modeled as\ndi = gi [\u2206Tvi + \u2206Tai ] + bi ,\n(2)\nwhere i is a time index, gi and bi are the instrument gain and baseline, at time step i, \u2206Tvi\nis the differential dipole anisotropy induced by WMAP's motion, and \u2206Tai is the differential\nsky anisotropy. We assume that \u2206Tvi is known exactly and has the form\n\u2206Tvi =\n\nT0\nvi * [(1 + xim )nA,i \u2212 (1 \u2212 xim )nB,i ],\nc\n\n(3)\n\nwhere T0 = 2.725 K is the CMB temperature (Mather et al. 1999), c is the speed of light,\nvi is WMAP's velocity with respect to the CMB rest frame at time step i, xim is the loss\nimbalance parameter (Jarosik et al. 2007), and nA,i , and nB,i are the unit vectors of the\nA- and B-side lines of sight at time step i (in the same frame as the velocity vector). The\nvelocity may be decomposed as\nvi = vWMAP\u2212SSB,i + vSSB\u2212CMB ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the first term is WMAP's velocity with respect to the solar system barycenter, and the\nsecond is the barycenter velocity with respect to the CMB. The former is well determined\nfrom ephemeris data, while the latter has been measured by COBE-DMR with an uncertainty\nof 0.7% (Kogut et al. 1996). Since the latter velocity is constant over WMAP's life span, any\nerror in our assumed value of vSSB\u2212CMB will, in theory, be absorbed into a dipole contribution\nto the anisotropy map, Ta . We test this hypothesis below. The differential sky signal has\nthe form\n\u2206Tai = (1 + xim )[Ia (pA,i ) + Pa (pA,i , \u03b3A,i)] \u2212 (1 \u2212 xim )[Ia (pB,i ) + Pa (pB,i , \u03b3B,i )],\n\n(5)\n\nwhere pA,i is the pixel observed by the A-side at time step i (and similarly for B), Ia (p) is\nthe temperature anisotropy in pixel p (the intensity Stokes parameter, I), and Pa (p, \u03b3) is\nthe polarization anisotropy in pixel p at polarization angle \u03b3 (Hinshaw et al. 2003) which is\nrelated to the linear Stokes parameters Q and U by\nPa (p, \u03b3) = Q(p) cos 2\u03b3 + U(p) sin 2\u03b3.\n\n(6)\n\nWe further note that, in general, Ia and Pa depend on frequency owing to Galactic emission.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nA main goal of the data processing is to simultaneously fit for the calibration and sky\nsignal. Unfortunately, since the data model is nonlinear and the number of parameters\nis large, the general problem is intractable. In practice, we proceed iteratively as follows.\nInitially we assume the gain and baseline are constant for a given time interval, typically\nbetween 1 and 24 hours,\ng i = Gk\n\n\u03c4k < ti < \u03c4k+1\n\n(7)\n\nbi = Bk\n\n\u03c4k < ti < \u03c4k+1 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere ti is the time of the ith individual observation, and \u03c4k is the start time of the kth\ncalibration interval. Throughout the fit we fix the velocity-induced signal, equation (3),\nusing vSSB\u2212CMB = [\u221226.29, \u2212244.96, +275.93] km s\u22121 (in Galactic coordinates), and, for the\nfirst iteration, we assume no anisotropy signal, \u2206Ta = 0. Then, for each calibration interval\nk we perform a linear fit for Gk and Bk with fixed \u2206Tv + \u2206Ta . As we proceed through\nthe intervals, we apply this calibration to the raw data and accumulate a new estimate of\nthe anisotropy map as per equation 19 of Hinshaw et al. (2003). The procedure is repeated\nwith each updated estimate of \u2206Ta . Once the calibration solution has converged, we fit the\ngain data, Gk , to a model that is parameterized by the instrument detector voltage and the\ntemperatures of the receiver's warm and cold stages, equation 2 of Jarosik et al. (2007). This\nparametrization still provides a good fit to the Gk data, so we have not updated its form for\nthe 5 year analysis. The updated best-fit parameters are given in the 5 year Explanatory\nSupplement (Limon et al. 2008). Note that for each radiometer, the relative gain vs. time\nover 5 years is determined by just two parameters.\nFor the 5 year processing we have focused on the veracity of the \"raw\" calibration, Gk\nand Bk . Specifically, we have improved and/or critically reexamined several aspects of the\niterative fitting procedure:\n\u2022 We have incorporated the effect of far sidelobe pickup directly into the iterative calibration procedure, rather than as a fixed correction (Jarosik et al. 2007). We do this\nby segregating the differential signal into a main beam contribution and a sidelobe\ncontribution,\n\u2206Ti = \u2206Tmain,i + \u2206Tside,i .\n(9)\n(Hill et al. 2008 discuss how this segregation is defined in the 5 year processing.) After\neach iteration of the calibration and sky map estimation, we (re)compute a database\nof \u2206Tside on a grid of pointings using the new estimate of Ia . We then interpolate the\ndatabase to estimate \u2206Tside,i for each time step i. Note that \u2206Tside includes contributions from both the velocity-induced signal and the intrinsic anisotropy. Ignoring\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nsidelobe pickup can induce gain errors of up to 1.5% in K band, 0.4% in Ka band, and\n\u223c0.25% in Q-W bands.\n\u2022 In general, the different channels within a DA have different center frequencies (Jarosik et al.\n2003); hence the different channels measure a slightly different anisotropy signal due\nto differences in the Galactic signal. We assess the importance of accounting for this\nin the calibration procedure.\n\u2022 A single DA channel is only sensitive to a single linear polarization state. (WMAP measures polarization by differencing orthogonal polarization channels.) Thus we cannot\nreliably solve for both Pa and for Ia at each channel's center frequency. We assess the\nrelative importance of accounting for one or the other on both the gain and baseline\nsolutions.\n\u2022 We examine the sensitivity of the calibration solution to the choice of vSSB\u2212CMB and\nto assumptions of time-dependence in the gain.\n\n4.1.\n\nCalibration Tests\n\nWe use a variety of end-to-end simulations to assess and control the systematic effects\nnoted above. We summarize a number of the key tests in the remainder of this section.\nThe first case we consider is a noiseless simulation in which we generate time-ordered\ndata from an input anisotropy map which includes CMB and Galactic foreground signal (one\nmap per channel, evaluated at the center frequency of each channel) and a known dipole\namplitude. The input gain for each channel is fixed to be constant in time. We run the\niterative calibration and sky map solver allowing for an independent sky map solution at\neach channel (but no polarization signal). When fitting for the calibration, we assume that\nvSSB\u2212CMB differs from the input value by 1% to see if the known, modulated velocity term,\nvWMAP\u2212SSB , properly \"anchors\" the absolute gain solution. The results are shown in the top\npanel of Figure 6 where it is shown that the absolute gain recovery is robust to errors in\nvSSB\u2212CMB . We recover the input gain to better than 0.1% in this instance.\nThe second case we consider is again a noiseless simulation that now includes only dipole\nsignal (with Earth-velocity modulation), but here we vary the input gain using the flightderived gain model (Jarosik et al. 2007). The iterative solver was run on the K band data\nfor 1400 iterations, again starting with an initial guess that was in error by 1%. The results\nare shown in the bottom panel of Figure 6, which indicate systematic convergence errors of\n>0.3% in the fitted amplitude of the recovered gain model. Since the input sky signal in this\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\ncase does not have any Galactic foreground or polarization components, we cannot ascribe\nthe recovery errors to the improper handling of those effects in the iterative solver. We have\nalso run numerous other simulations that included various combinations of instrument noise,\nCMB anisotropy, Galactic foreground signal (with or without individual center frequencies\nper channel), polarization signal, and input gain variations. The combination of runs are\ntoo numerous to report on in detail, and the results are not especially enlightening. The\nmost pertinent trend we can identify is that when the input value of vSSB\u2212CMB is assumed\nin the iterative solver, the recovered gain is in good agreement with the input, but when the\ninitial guess is in error by 1%, the recovered gain will have comparable errors. We believe\nthe lack of convergence is due to a weak degeneracy between gain variations and the sky map\nsolution. Such a degeneracy is difficult to diagnose in the context of this iterative solver,\nespecially given the computational demands of the system, so we are assessing the system\nmore directly with a low-resolution parameterization of the gain and sky signal, as outlined\nin Appendix A.\nSince the latter effort is still underway, we have adopted a more pragmatic approach\nto evaluating the absolute gain and its uncertainty for the 5 year data release. We proceed\nas follows: after 50 iterations of the calibration and sky map solver, the dominant errors\nin the gain and sky map solution are 1) a dipole in the sky map, and 2) a characteristic\nwave form that reflects a relative error between vSSB\u2212CMB and vWMAP\u2212SSB . At this point\nwe can calibrate the amplitude of the gain error wave form to the magnitude of the velocity\nerror in vSSB\u2212CMB . We can then fit the gain solution to a linear combination of the gain\nmodel of Jarosik et al. (2007) and the velocity error wave form. See Appendix B for details\non this fitting procedure. In practice this fit is performed simultaneously on both channels\nof a radiometer since those channels share one gain model parameter. We have tested this\nprocedure on a complete flight-like simulations that includes every important effect known,\nincluding input gain variations. The results of the gain recovery are shown in Figure 7,\nand based on this we conservatively assign an absolute calibration uncertainty of 0.2% per\nchannel for the 5 year WMAP archive.\n\n4.2.\n\nSummary\n\nThe series of steps taken to arrive at the final 5 year calibration are as follows:\n\u2022 Run the iterative calibration and sky map solver over the full 5 year data set for 50\niterations, using 24 hour calibration intervals. This run starts with Ia = Pa = 0 and\nupdates Ia for each individual channel of data. Pa is assumed to be 0 throughout this\nrun. We keep the gain solution, Gk , from this run and discard the baseline solution.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\u2022 Run the iterative calibration and sky map solver over the full 5 year data set for 50\niterations, using 1 hour calibration intervals. This run starts with Ia = Pa = 0 and\nupdates both using the intensity and polarization data in the two radiometers per DA,\nas per Appendix D of Hinshaw et al. (2003). We keep the baseline solution, Bk , from\nthis run and discard the gain solution. Both of these runs incorporate the sidelobe\ncorrection as noted above.\n\u2022 Fit the gain solution, Gk simultaneously for the gain model and for an error in the velocity, \u2206vSSB\u2212CMB , as described in Appendix B. This fit is performed on two channels\nper radiometer with the gain model parameter T0 common to both channels.\n\u2022 We average the best-fit velocity error over all channels within a frequency band under\nthe assumption that the dipole is the same in each of these channels. We then fix the\nvelocity error to a single value per frequency band and re-fit the gain model parameters\nfor each pair of radiometer channels.\nBased on end-to-end simulations with flight-like noise, we estimate the absolute gain\nerror per radiometer to be 0.2%. We believe the limiting factor in this estimate is a weak\ndegeneracy between thermal variations in the instrument gain, which are annually modulated, and annual variations induced by errors in vSSB\u2212CMB . Since there is a small monotonic\nincrease in the spacecraft temperature, additional years of data should allow improvements\nin our ability to separate these effects.\nOnce we have finalized the gain model, we form a calibrated time-ordered data archive\nusing the gain model and the 1 hour baseline estimates to calibrate the data. This archive\nalso has a final estimate of the far sidelobe pickup subtracted from each time-ordered data\npoint. However, we opt not to subtract a dipole estimate from the archive at this stage in\nthe processing.\n\n5.\n\nBEAM IMPROVEMENTS\n\nIn addition to reassessing the calibration, the other major effort undertaken to improve\nthe 5 year data processing was to extend the physical optics model of the WMAP telescope\nbased on flight measurements of Jupiter. This work is described in detail in Hill et al. (2008)\nso we only summarize the key results with an emphasis on their scientific implications. The\nbasic aim of the work is to use the flight beam maps from all 10 DA's to determine the\nin-flight distortion of the mirrors. This program was begun for the A-side mirror during the\n3 year analysis; for the 5 year analysis we have quadrupled the number of distortion modes\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nwe fit (probing distortion scales that are half the previous size), and we have developed a\ncompletely new and independent model of the B-side distortions, rather than assuming that\nthey mirror the A-side distortions. We have also placed limits on smaller scale distortions\nby comparing the predicted beam response at large angles to sidelobe data collected during\nWMAP's early observations of the Moon.\nGiven the best-fit mirror model, we compute the model beam response for each DA\nand use it in conjunction with the flight data to constrain the faint tails of the beams,\nbeyond \u223c 1\u25e6 from the beam peak. These tails are difficult to constrain with flight data\nalone because the Jupiter signal to noise ratio is low, but, due to their large areal extent\nthey contain a non-negligible fraction (up to 1%) of the total beam solid angle. An accurate\ndetermination of the beam tail is required to properly measure the ratio of sub-degree-scale\npower to larger-scale power in the diffuse CMB emission (and to accurately assign point\nsource flux).\nFigure 14 in Hill et al. (2008) compares the beam radial profiles used in the 3 year and\n5 year analyses, while Figure 13 compares the l-space transfer functions derived from the\nLegendre transform of the radial profile. The important changes to note are the following.\n1. In both analyses we split the beam response into main beam and far sidelobe contributions. In the 5 year analysis we have enlarged the radius at which this transition is\nmade (Hill et al. 2008). In both cases, we correct the time-ordered data for far sidelobe\npickup prior to making sky maps, while the main beam contribution is only accounted\nfor in the analysis of sky maps, e.g., in power spectrum deconvolution. As a result,\nthe sky maps have a slightly different effective resolution which is most apparent in\nK band, as in Figure 5. However, in each analysis, the derived transfer functions are\nappropriate for the corresponding sky maps.\n2. In the 3 year analysis, the main beam profile was described by a Hermite polynomial\nexpansion fit to the observations of Jupiter in the time-ordered data. This approach\nwas numerically problematic in the 5 year analysis due to the larger transition radius;\nas a result, we now simply co-add the time-ordered data into radial bins to obtain the\nprofiles. In both cases, the underlying time-ordered data is a hybrid archive consisting\nof flight data for points where the beam model predicts a value above a given contour,\nand model values for points below the contour (Hill et al. 2008). With the improved\nbeam models and a new error analysis, we have adjusted these hybrid contours down\nslightly, with the result that we use proportionately more flight data (per year) in the\nnew analysis. The radius at which the 5 year profile becomes model dominated (>50%\nof the points in a bin) is indicated by dotted lines in Figure 14 of Hill et al. (2008).\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n3. The right column of Figure 14 in Hill et al. (2008) shows the fractional change in solid\nangle due to the updated profiles. The main point to note is the \u223c1% increase in the\nV2 and W band channels, primarily arising in the bin from 1 to 2 degrees off the beam\npeak. As can be seen in Figure 3 of Hill et al. (2008), this is the angular range in which\nthe new beam models produced the most change, owing to the incorporation of smaller\ndistortion modes in the mirror model. The 3 year analysis made use of the model in\nthis angular range which, in hindsight, was suppressing up to \u223c1% of the solid angle\nin the V and W band beams. (The longer wavelength channels are less sensitive to\ndistortions in this range, so the change in solid angle is smaller for K-Q bands.) In the\n5 year analysis, we use relatively more flight data in this regime, so we are less sensitive\nto any remaining model uncertainties. Hill et al. (2008) place limits on residual model\nerrors and propagate those errors into the overall beam uncertainty.\n4. Figure 13 in Hill et al. (2008) compares the beam transfer functions, bl , derived by\ntransforming the 3 year and 5 year radial profiles. (To factor out the effect of changing\nthe transition radius, the 3 year profiles were extended to the 5 year radius using the\nfar sidelobe data, for this comparison.) Since the transfer functions are normalized to\n1 at l = 1, the change is restricted to high l. In V and W bands, bl has decreased by\n\u223c0.5 - 1% due largely to the additional solid angle picked up in the 1-2 degree range.\nThis amounts to a \u223c1 \u03c3 change in the functions, as indicated by the red curves in the\nFigure.\nThe calibrated angular power spectrum is proportional to 1/g 2b2l , where g is the mean\ngain and bl is the beam transfer function, thus the net effect of the change in gain and beam\ndeterminations is to increase the power spectrum by \u223c0.5% at l . 100, and by \u223c2.5% at high\nl. Nolta et al. (2008) give a detailed evaluation of the power spectrum while Dunkley et al.\n(2008) and Komatsu et al. (2008) discuss the implications for cosmology.\n\n6.\n\nLOW-l POLARIZATION TESTS\n\nThe 3 year data release included the first measurement of microwave polarization over\nthe full sky, in the form of Stokes Q and U maps in each of 5 bands. The analysis of WMAP\npolarization data is complicated by the fact that the instrument was not designed to be a\ntrue polarimeter, thus a number of systematic effects had to be understood prior to assigning\nreliable error estimates to the data. Page et al. (2007) presented the 3 year polarization data\nin great detail. In this section we extend that analysis by considering some additional tests\nthat were not covered in the 3 year analysis. We note that all of the tests described in\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nthis section have been performed on the template-cleaned reduced-foreground maps except\nfor the final test of the Ka band data, described at the end of the section, which tests an\nalternative cleaning method.\n\n6.1.\n\nYear-to-Year Consistency Tests\n\nWith 5 years of data it is now possible to subject the data to more stringent consistency\ntests than was previously possible. In general, the number of independent cross-power spectra\nwe can form within a band with Nd differencing assemblies is Nd (Nd \u2212 1)/2 \u00d7 Ny + Nd2 \u00d7\nNy (Ny \u2212 1)/2. With 5 years of data, this gives 10 independent estimates each in K and Ka\nband, 45 each in Q and V band, and 190 in W band. For cross power spectra of distinct\nband pairs, with Nd1 and Nd2 DA's in each band, the number is Nd1 Nd2 \u00d7 Ny2 . This gives\n50 each in KaQ and KaV, 100 each in KaW and QV, and 200 each in QW and VW. (For\ncomparison, the corresponding numbers are 3, 15, & 66, and 18, 36, & 72 with 3 years of\ndata.)\nWe have evaluated these individual spectra from the 5 year data and have assigned noise\nuncertainties to each estimate using the Fisher formalism described in Page et al. (2007).\nWe subject the ensemble to an internal consistency test by computing the reduced \u03c72 of the\ndata at each multipole l within each band or band pair, under the hypothesis that the data\nat each multipole and band measures the same number from DA to DA and year to year.\nThe results of this test are given in Table 5 for the foreground-cleaned EE, EB, and BB\nspectra from l = 2 \u2212 10 for all band pairs from KaKa to WW. There are several points to\nnote in these results.\n1. For l \u2265 6, the most significant deviation from 1 in reduced \u03c72 , in any spectrum or\nband, is 1.594 in the l = 7 BB spectrum for KaQ. With 50 degrees of freedom, this\nis a 3 \u03c3 deviation, but given that we have 150 l \u2265 6 samples in the table, we expect\nof order 1 such value. Thus we conclude that the Fisher-based errors provide a good\ndescription of the DA-to-DA and year-to-year scatter in the l \u2265 6 polarization data. If\nanything, there is a slight tendency to overestimate the uncertainties at higher l.\n2. For l \u2264 5, we find 37 out of 120 points where the reduced \u03c72 deviates from 1 at more\nthan 4 \u03c3 significance, indicating excessive internal scatter in the data relative to the\nFisher errors. However, all but 5 of these occur in cross-power spectra in which one\nor both of the bands contain W band data. If we exclude combinations with W band,\nthe remaining 72 points have a mode in the reduced \u03c72 distribution of 1 with a slight\npositive skewness due to the 5 points noted above, which all contain Q band data. This\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nmay be a sign of slight foreground residuals contributing additional noise to the Q band\ndata, though we do not see similar evidence in the Ka band spectra which would be\nmore foreground contaminated prior to cleaning. For Ka-V bands, we believe that the\nFisher errors provide an adequate description of the scatter in this l \u2264 5 polarization\ndata, but we subject polarization sensitive cosmological parameter estimates, e.g., the\noptical depth, to additional scrutiny in \u00a76.3.\n3. Of special note is l = 3 BB which, as noted in Page et al. (2007), is the power spectrum mode that is least modulated in the WMAP time-ordered data. This mode is\ntherefore quite sensitive to how the instrument baseline is estimated and removed and,\nin turn, to how the 1/f noise is modeled. In the accounting above, the l = 3 BB data\nhave the highest internal scatter of any low-l polarization mode. In particular, every\ncombination that includes W band data is significantly discrepant; and the two most\ndiscrepant non-W band points are also estimates of l = 3 BB. We comment on the W\nband data further below, but note here that the final co-added BB spectrum (based\non Ka, Q, and V band data) does not lead to a significant detection of tensor modes.\nHowever, we caution that any surprising scientific conclusions which rely heavily on\nthe WMAP l = 3 BB data should be treated with caution.\nBased on the analysis presented above, we find the W band polarization data is still\ntoo unstable at low-l to be reliably used for cosmological studies. We cite more specific\nphenomenology and consider some possible explanations in the remainder of this section.\nThe 5 year co-added W band EE spectrum is shown in Figures 8, in the form of likelihood\nprofiles from l = 2 \u2212 7. At each multipole we show two curves: an estimate based on\nevaluating the likelihood multipole by multipole, and an estimate based on the pseudo-Cl\nmethod (Page et al. 2007). The best-fit model EE spectrum, based on the combined Ka, Q,\nand V band data is indicated by the dashed lines in each panel. Both spectrum estimates\nshow excess power relative to the model spectrum, with the most puzzling multipole being\nl = 7 which, as shown in Table 5, has an internal reduced \u03c72 of 1.015, for 190 degrees of\nfreedom. This data has the hallmark of a sky signal, but that hypothesis is implausible for\na variety of reasons (Page et al. 2007). It is more likely due to a systematic effect that is\ncommon to a majority of the W band channels over a majority of the 5 years of data. We\nexplore and rule out one previously neglected effect in \u00a76.2. It is worth recalling that l = 7\nEE, like l = 3 BB, is a mode that is relatively poorly measured by WMAP, as discussed in\nPage et al. (2007); see especially Figure 16 and its related discussion.\nThe W band BB data also exhibit unusual behavior at l = 2, 3. In this case, these two\nmultipoles have internal reduced \u03c72 greater than 6, and the co-added l = 2 point is nearly\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n10 \u03c3 from zero. However, with 190 points in each 5 year co-added estimate it is now possible\nto look for trends within the data that were relatively obscure with only 3 years of data. In\nparticular, we note that in the l = 2 estimate, there are 28 points that are individually more\nthan 5 \u03c3 from zero and that all of them contain W1 data in one or both of the DA pairs in\nthe cross power spectrum. Similarly for l = 3, there are 14 points greater than 5 \u03c3 and all of\nthose points contain W4 data in one or both of the DA pairs. We have yet to pinpoint the\nsignificance of this result, but we plan to study the noise properties of these DA's beyond\nwhat has been reported to date, and to sharpen the phenomenology with additional years\nof data.\n\n6.2.\n\nEmissivity Tests\n\nIn this section we consider time dependent emission from the WMAP optics as a candidate for explaining the excess W band \"signal\" seen in the EE spectrum, mostly at l = 7.\nIn the end, the effect proved not to be significant, but it provides a useful illustration of a\ncommon-mode effect that we believe is still present in the W band polarization data.\nFrom a number of lines of reasoning, we know that the microwave emissivity of the\nmirrors is a few percent in W band, and that it scales with frequency roughly like \u03bd 1.5 across\nthe WMAP frequency range, as expected for a classical metal (Born & Wolf 1980). Hence\nthis mechanism has the potential to explain a common-mode effect that is primarily seen in\nW band. Further, Figure 1 in Jarosik et al. (2007) shows that the physical temperature of\nthe primary mirrors are modulated at the spin period by \u223c200 \u03bcK, with a dependence on\nsolar azimuth angle that is highly repeatable from year to year. We believe this modulation\nis driven by solar radiation diffracting around the WMAP sun shield reaching the tops of\nthe primary mirrors, which are only a few degrees within the geometric shadow of the sun\nshield. In contrast, the secondary mirrors and feed horns are in deep shadow and show no\nmeasurable variation at the spin period, so that any emission they produce only contributes\nto an overall radiometer offset, and will not be further considered here.\nAs a rough estimate, the spin modulated emission from the primary mirrors could\nproduce as much as \u223c 0.02 \u00d7 200 = 4 \u03bcK of radiometric response in W band, but the\nactual signal depends on the relative phase of the A and B-side mirror variations and the\npolarization state of the emission. In more detail, the differential signal, d(t), measured by\na radiometer with lossy elements is\nd(t) = (1 \u2212 \u01ebA ) TA (t) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u01ebB ) TB (t) + \u01ebpA TAp (t) \u2212 \u01ebpB TBp (t)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u01ebA = \u01ebpA +\u01ebsA +\u01ebfA is the combined loss in the A-side optics: (p)rimary plus (s)econdary\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nmirrors, plus the (f)eed horn, and likewise for the B-side. TA,B is the sky temperature in the\np\ndirection of the A or B-side line-of-sight; and TA,B\nis the physical temperature of the A or\nB-side primary mirror.\nThe first two terms are the sky signal attenuated by the overall loss in the A and B\nside optics, respectively. The effects of loss imbalance, which arise when \u01ebA 6= \u01ebB , have been\nstudied extensively (Jarosik et al. 2003, 2007). We account for loss imbalance in the data\nprocessing and we marginalize over residual uncertainties in the imbalance coefficients when\nwe form the pixel-pixel inverse covariance matrices (Jarosik et al. 2007). Updated estimates\nof the loss imbalance coefficients based on fits to the 5 year data are reported in Table 6.\nIn the remainder of this section we focus on the last two emissive terms in Equation 10.\nRecall that a WMAP differencing assembly consists of two radiometers, 1 and 2, that are\nsensitive to orthogonal linear polarization modes. The temperature and polarization signals\nare extracted by forming the sum and difference of the two radiometer outputs; thus, the\nemission terms we need to evaluate are\n\u0012 p\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 p\n\u01ebA1 \u00b1 \u01ebpA2\n\u01ebB1 \u00b1 \u01ebpB2\np\np\np\nd1 (t) \u00b1 d2 (t) =\nTA \u2212\nTBp\n(11)\n1\u2212\u01eb\n1\u2212\u01eb\n\nwhere \u01ebpA1 is the A-side primary mirror emissivity measured by radiometer 1, and so forth.\nThe factor of 1 \u2212 \u01eb in the denominator applies a small correction for the mean loss, \u01eb \u2261\n(\u01ebA + \u01ebB )/2, and arises from the process of calibrating the data to a known sky brightness\ntemperature (\u00a74). Note that we only pick up a polarized response if \u01eb1 6= \u01eb2 .\n\nWe have simulated this signal in the time-ordered data using the measured primary\nmirror temperatures as template inputs. The emissivity coefficients were initially chosen to\nbe consistent with the loss imbalance constraints. However, in order to produce a measurable\npolarization signal, we had to boost the emissivity differences to the point where they became\nunphysical, that is |\u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb2 | > |\u01eb1 + \u01eb2 |. Nonetheless, it was instructive to analyze this\nsimulation by binning the resulting data (which also includes sky signal and noise) as a\nfunction of solar azimuth. The results are shown in the top panel of Figure 9 which shows 3\nyears of co-added W band polarization data, the d1 \u2212 d2 channel; the input emissive signal\nis shown in red for comparison. We are clearly able to detect such a signal with this manner\nof binning. We also computed the low-l polarization spectra and found that, despite the\nlarge spin modulated input signal, the signal induced in the power spectrum was less than 2\n\u03bcK2 in l(l + 1)ClEE /2\u03c0, which is insufficient to explain the l = 7 feature in the W band EE\nspectrum.\nIn parallel with the simulation analysis, we have binned the flight radiometer data by\nsolar azimuth angle to search for spin modulated features in the polarization data. The\nresults for W band are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 9 for the 5 year data. While\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\nthe \u03c72 per degree of freedom relative to zero is slightly high, there is no compelling evidence\nfor a coherent spin modulated signal at the \u223c2 \u03bcK level. In contrast, the simulation yielded\nspin modulated signals of 5-10 \u03bcK and still failed to produce a significant effect in the EE\nspectrum. Hence we conclude that thermal emission from the WMAP optics cannot explain\nthe excess W band EE signal. In any event, we continue to monitor the spin modulated data\nfor the emergence of a coherent signal.\n\n6.3.\n\nKa Band Tests\n\nThe analysis presented in \u00a76.1 shows that the Ka band polarization data is comparable\nto the Q and V band data in its internal consistency. That analysis was performed on data\nthat had been foreground cleaned using the template method discussed in Page et al. (2007)\nand updated in Gold et al. (2008). In order to assess whether or not this cleaned Ka band\ndata is suitable for use in cosmological parameter estimation we subject it to two further\ntests: 1) a null test in which Ka band data is compared to the combined Q and V band data,\nand 2) a parameter estimation based solely on Ka band data.\nFor the null test, we form polarization maps by taking differences, 12 SKa \u2212 12 SQV , where\nS = Q,U are the polarization Stokes parameters, SKa are the maps formed from the Ka band\ndata, and SQV are the maps formed from the optimal combination of the Q and V band\ndata. We evaluate the EE power spectrum from these null maps by evaluating the likelihood\nmode by mode while holding the other multipoles fixed at zero. The results are shown in\nFigure 10, along with the best-fit model spectrum based on the final 5 year \u039bCDM analysis.\nThe spectrum is clearly consistent with zero, but to get a better sense of the power of this\ntest, we have also used these null maps to estimate the optical depth parameter, \u03c4 . The\nresult of that analysis is shown as the dashed curve in Figure 11, where we find that the\nnull likelihood peaks at \u03c4 = 0 and excludes the most-likely cosmological value with \u223c95%\nconfidence.\nAs a separate test, we evaluate the \u03c4 likelihood using only the template-cleaned Ka\nband signal maps. The result of that test is shown as the blue curve in Figure 11. While the\nuncertainty in the Ka band estimate is considerably larger than the combined QV estimate\n(shown in red), the estimates are highly consistent. The result of combining Ka, Q, and V\nband data is shown in the black curve.\nDunkley et al. (2008) present a complementary method of foreground cleaning that\nmakes use of Ka band data, in conjunction with K, Q, and V band data. Using a full\n6 parameter likelihood evalutaion, they compare the optical depth inferred from the two\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\ncleaning methods while using the full combined data sets in both cases: see Figure 9 of\nDunkley et al. (2008) for details. Based on these tests, we conclude that the Ka band data\nis sufficiently free of systematic errors and residual foreground signals that it is suitable for\ncosmological studies. The use of this band significantly enhances the overall polarization\nsensitivity of WMAP.\n\n7.\n\nSUMMARY OF 5-YEAR SCIENCE RESULTS\n\nDetailed presentations of the scientific results from the 5 year data are given by Gold et al.\n(2008), Wright et al. (2008), Nolta et al. (2008), Dunkley et al. (2008), and Komatsu et al.\n(2008). Starting with the 5 year temperature and polarization maps, with their improved\ncalibration, Gold et al. (2008) give a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based analysis of foreground emission in the data. Their results are broadly consistent with previous analyses\nby the WMAP team and others (Eriksen et al. 2007c), while providing some new results on\nthe microwave spectra of bright sources in the Galactic plane that aren't well fit by simple\npower-law foreground models. Figure 12 shows the 5 year CMB map based on the internal\nlinear combination (ILC) method of foreground removal.\nWright et al. (2008) give a comprehensive analysis of the extragalactic sources in the 5\nyear data, including a new analysis of variability made possible by the multi-year coverage.\nThe 5 year WMAP source catalog now contains 390 objects and is reasonably complete\nto a flux of 1 Jy away from the Galactic plane. The new analysis of the WMAP beam\nresponse (Hill et al. 2008) has led to more precise estimates of the point source flux scale\nfor all 5 WMAP frequency bands. This information is incorporated in the new source\ncatalog (Wright et al. 2008), and is also used to provide new brightness estimates of Mars,\nJupiter, and Saturn (Hill et al. 2008). We find significant (and expected) variability in Mars\nand Saturn over the course of 5 years and use that information to provide a preliminary\nrecalibration of a Mars brightness model (Wright 2007), and to fit a simple model of Saturn's\nbrightness as a function of ring inclination.\nThe temperature and polarization power spectra are presented in Nolta et al. (2008).\nThe spectra are all consistent with the 3 year results with improvements in sensitivity commensurate with the additional integration time. Further improvements in our understanding\nof the absolute calibration and beam response have allowed us to place tighter uncertainties\non the power spectra, over and above the reductions from additional data. These changes\nare all reflected in the new version of the WMAP likelihood code. The most notable improvements arise in the third acoustic peak of the TT spectrum, and in all of the polarization\nspectra; for example, we now see unambiguous evidence for a 2nd dip in the high-l TE spec-\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\ntrum, which further constrains deviations from the standard \u039bCDM model. The 5 year TT\nand TE spectra are shown in Figure 13. We have also generated new maximum likelihood\nestimates of the low-l polarization spectra: TE, TB, EE, EB, and BB to complement our\nearlier estimates based on pseudo-Cl methods (Nolta et al. 2008). The TB, EB, and BB\nspectra remain consistent with zero.\nThe cosmological implications of the 5 year WMAP data are discussed in detail in\nDunkley et al. (2008) and Komatsu et al. (2008). The now-standard cosmological model: a\nflat universe dominated by vacuum energy and dark matter, seeded by nearly scale-invariant,\nadiabatic, Gaussian random-phase fluctuations, continues to fit the 5 year data. WMAP has\nnow determined the key parameters of this model to high precision; a summary of the 5 year\nparameter results is given in Table 7. The most notable improvements are the measurements\nof the dark matter density, \u03a9c h2 , and the amplitude of matter fluctuations today, \u03c38 . The\nformer is determined with 6% uncertainty using WMAP data only (Dunkley et al. 2008),\nand with 3% uncertainty when WMAP data is combined with BAO and SNe constraints\n(Komatsu et al. 2008). The latter is measured to 5% with WMAP data, and to 3% when\ncombined with other data. The redshift of reionization is zreion = 11.0 \u00b1 1.4, if the universe\nwere reionized instantaneously. The 2 \u03c3 lower limit is zreion >8.2, and instantaneous reionization at zreion = 6 is rejected at 3.5 \u03c3. The WMAP data continues to favor models with a\ntilted primordial spectrum, ns = 0.963+0.014\n\u22120.015 . Dunkley et al. (2008) discuss how the \u039bCDM\nmodel continues to fit a host of other astronomical data as well.\nMoving beyond the standard \u039bCDM model, when WMAP data is combined with BAO\nand SNe observations (Komatsu et al. 2008), we find no evidence for running in the spectral\nindex of scalar fluctuations, dns /d ln k = \u22120.028 \u00b1 0.020 (68% CL). The new limit on the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.22 (95% CL), and we obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the\n(constant) dark energy equation of state and the spatial curvature of the universe: \u22120.14 <\n1 + w < 0.12 (95% CL) and \u22120.0179 < \u03a9k < 0.0081 (95% CL). The angular power spectrum\nnow exhibits the signature of the cosmic neutrino background: the number of relativistic\ndegrees of freedom, expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is found\nto be Neff = 4.4 \u00b1 1.5 (68% CL), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Models with\nNeff = 0 are disfavored at >99.5% confidence. A summary of the key cosmological parameter\nvalues is given in Table 7, where we provide estimates using WMAP data alone and WMAP\ndata combined with BAO and SNe observations. A complete tabulation of all parameter\nvalues for each model and dataset combination we studied is available on LAMBDA.\nThe new data also place more stringent limits on deviations from Gaussianity, parity violations, and the amplitude of isocurvature fluctuations (Komatsu et al. 2008). For\nexample, new limits on physically motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are\n\n\f\u2013 26 \u2013\nequil\n\u22129 < fNlocal\nL < 111 (95% CL) and \u2212151 < fN L < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral\nmodels, respectively.\n\n8.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented an overview of the 5 year WMAP data and have highlighted the\nimprovements we have made to the data processing and analysis since the 3 year results were\npresented. The most substantive improvements to the processing include a new method for\nestablishing the absolute gain calibration (with reduced uncertainty), and a more complete\nanalysis of the WMAP beam response made possible by additional data and a higher fidelity\nphysical optics model. Numerous other processing changes are outlined in \u00a72.\nThe 5 year sky maps are consistent with the 3 year maps and have noise levels that are\n5 times less than the single year maps. The new maps are compared to the 3 year maps\nin \u00a73. The main changes to the angular power spectrum are as follows: at low multipoles\n(l . 100) the spectrum is \u223c0.5% higher than the 3 year spectrum (in power units) due to the\nnew absolute gain determination. At higher multipoles it is increased by \u223c2.5%, due to the\nnew beam response profiles, as explained in \u00a75 and in Hill et al. (2008). These changes are\nconsistent with the 3 year uncertainties when one accounts for both the 0.5% gain uncertainty\n(in temperature units) and the 3 year beam uncertainties, which were incorporated into the\nlikelihood code.\n\u221a\n\nWe have applied a number of new tests to the polarization data to check internal consistency and to look for new systematic effects in the W band data (\u00a76). As a result of these\ntests, and of new analyses of polarized foreground emission (Dunkley et al. 2008), we have\nconcluded that Ka band data can be used along with Q and V band data for cosmological\nanalyses. However, we still find a number of features in the W band polarization data that\npreclude its use, except in the Galactic plane where the signal to noise is relatively high. We\ncontinue to investigate the causes of this and have identified new clues to follow up on in\nfuture studies (\u00a76.1).\nScientific results gathered from the suite of 5 year papers are summarized in \u00a77. The\nhighlights include smaller uncertainties in the optical depth, \u03c4 , due to a combination of\nadditional years of data and to the inclusion of Ka band polarization data: instantaneous\nreionization at zreion = 6 is now rejected at 3.5 \u03c3. New evidence favoring a non-zero neutrino\nabundance at the epoch of last scattering, made possible by improved measurements of the\nthird acoustic peak; and new limits on the nongaussian parameter fN L , based on additional\ndata and the application of a new, more optimal bispectrum estimator. The 5 year data\n\n\f\u2013 27 \u2013\ncontinue to favor a tilted primordial fluctuation spectrum, in the range ns \u223c 0.96, but a\npurely scale invariant spectrum cannot be ruled out at >3 \u03c3 confidence.\nThe WMAP observatory continues to operate at L2 as designed, and the addition of\ntwo years of flight data has allowed us to make significant advances in characterizing the\ninstrument. Additional data beyond 5 years will give us a better understanding of the\ninstrument, especially with regards to the W band polarization data since the number of\njackknife combinations scales like the square of the number of years of operation. If W band\ndata can be incorporated into the EE power spectrum estimate, it would become possible to\nconstrain a second reionization parameter and thereby further probe this important epoch\nin cosmology. The WMAP data continues to uphold the standard \u039bCDM model but more\ndata may reveal new surprises.\n\n9.\n\nDATA PRODUCTS\n\nAll of the WMAP data is released to the research community for further analysis through\nthe Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA) at http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov.\nThe products include the complete 5 year time-ordered data archive (both raw and calibrated); the calibrated sky maps in a variety of processing stages (single year by DA,\nmulti-year by band, high resolution and low resolution, smoothed, foreground-subtracted,\nand so forth); the angular power spectra and cosmological model likelihood code; a full table\nof model parameter values for a variety of model and data sets (including the best-fit model\nspectra and Markov chains); and a host of ancillary data to support further analysis.

The raw data produced by an\nexperiment observing this signal is\nc(ti ) = g(ti)[\u2206tc (ti ) + \u2206tv (ti )]\n\n(B1)\n\nwhere c(ti ) is the TOD signal in counts, g(ti ) is the true gain of the instrument and \u2206tm (ti )\nis the differential signal produced by each dipole component (m = c, v) at time ti given the\ninstrument pointing at that time. Note that we have suppressed the explicit baseline and\nnoise terms here for simplicity.\nNow suppose we calibrate the instrument using an erroneous CMB dipole, d\u2032c = rdc =\n(1 + \u2206r)dc , where r is a number of order one (and \u2206r \u226a 1 so we can ignore terms of order\n\u2206r 2 ). The fit gain, gf (t), will then roughly have the form\ngf (t) =\n\n|d\u2032c\n\n|dc + dv (t)|\nc(t)\n= g(t)\n,\n+ dv (t)|\n|rdc + dv (t)|\n\n(B2)\n\nwhere the vertical bars indicate vector magnitude. Now define d \u2261 dc + dv and expand to\n1st order in \u2206r to get\n\u0014\n\u0015\nd(t) * dc\ngf (t) = g(t) 1 \u2212 \u2206r\n.\n(B3)\nd(t) * d(t)\n\nNote that the term (d * dc )/(d * d) is dominated by a constant component of order d2c /(d2c +\nd2v ) \u223c 0.99, followed by an annually modulated term that is suppressed by a factor of order\ndv /dc . Thus an erroneous calibration dipole induces a specific error in the fit gain that can\nbe identified and corrected for, assuming the time dependence of the true gain is orthogonal\nto this form.\n\nB.2.\n\nGain Model Fitting\n\nIn theory, the way to do this is as follows. We have a set of data in the form of the\nfit gains, gf,i for each calibration sequence i, and we have a gain model, G(t; pn ), which is a\nfunction of time and a set of model parameters pn . Ideally we would like to fit the model to\nthe true gain, g(t), but since we don't know the true gain, the next best thing is to modify\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\nthe gain model to have the same modulation form as the dipole gains have and to fit for this\nmodulation simultaneously with the other gain model parameters. Thus \u03c72 takes the form\n\u03c72 =\n\nX [gi \u2212 Gi (pn )]2\ni\n\n\u03c3i2\n\n=\n\nX [gf,i \u2212 Gi (pn )(1 \u2212 \u2206rfd,i )]2\ni\n\n\u03c3i2\n\n,\n\n(B4)\n\nwhere fd,i \u2261 (d * dc )/(d * d) evaluated at time ti , or is a function generated from simulations.\nSince the system is nonlinear, it must be minimized using a suitable nonlinear least\nsquares routine. However, we can analyze the parameter covariance matrix directly by\nexplicitly evaluating the 2nd derivative of \u03c72 with respect to the model parameters\nC\n\n\u22121\n\n1 \u2202 2 \u03c72\n=\n.\n2 \u2202pj \u2202pk\n\n(B5)\n\nFirst compile the necessary 1st derivatives\nX [gf,i \u2212 Gi (pn )(1 \u2212 \u2206rfd,i )] (Gi fd,i )\n1 \u2202\u03c72\n=\n2 \u2202\u2206r\n\u03c3i2\ni\n\n(B6)\n\nX [gf,i \u2212 Gi (pn )(1 \u2212 \u2206rfd,i )] (\u2212\u2202Gi /\u2202pm )(1 \u2212 \u2206rfd,i )\n1 \u2202\u03c72\n=\n2 \u2202pm\n\u03c3i2\ni\n\n(B7)\n\n(We evaluate the individual \u2202G/\u2202pm terms below.)

The vertical dashed lines indicate\nthe best-fit model power spectrum based on fitting the combined Ka, Q, and V band data.\nThe two spectrum estimates are consistent with each other, except at l = 3. The maximum\nlikelihood estimates are wider because they include cosmic variance whereas the pseudo-Cl\nestimates account for noise only. Both estimates show excess power in the W band data\nrelative to the best-fit model, and to the combined KaQV band spectrum, shown in Figure 6\nof Nolta et al. (2008). The extreme excess in the l = 7 pseudo-Cl estimate is not so severe\nin the maximum likelihood, but both methods are still inconsistent with the best-fit model.\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- top: Simulated W band data with a large polarized thermal emission signal injected,\nbinned by solar azimuth angle.

The black profile is the\nbinned co-added data which follows the input signal very well. The thickness of the points\nrepresents the 1 \u03c3 uncertainty due to white noise. bottom: Same as the top panel but for\nthe 5 year flight data. The reduced \u03c72 of the binned data with respect to zero is 2.1 for 36\ndegrees of freedom, but this does not account for 1/f noise, so the significance of this result\nrequires further investigation. However, the much larger signal in the simulation did not\nproduce an EE spectrum with features present in the flight W band EE spectrum, so the\nfeature in the binned flight data cannot account for the excess l = 7 emission.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- The EE power spectrum computed from the null sky maps, 21 SKa \u2212 21 SQV , where\nS = Q,U are the polarization Stokes parameters, and SQV is the optimal combination of the\nQ and V band data.

The dashed\ncurve labeled Null uses the same null sky maps used in Figure 10. The optical depth\nobtained from Ka band data alone (blue) is consistent with independent estimates from the\ncombined Q and V band data (red). The final 5 year analysis uses Ka, Q, and V band\ndata combined (black). These estimates all use a 1-parameter likelihood estimation, holding\nother parameters fixed except for the fluctuation amplitude, which is adjusted to fit the first\nacoustic peak in the TT spectrum (Page et al. 2007). The degeneracy between \u03c4 and other\n\u039bCDM parameters is small: see Figure 7 of Dunkley et al.
