With the identification of this star as a pulsar, the earlier\nsuggestion (Pacini 1967) that the star also emits a wave, whose energy is presumably released\ninto the Nebula, attracted considerable attention (Ostriker & Gunn 1969; Rees & Gunn 1974).\nAs an energy source for its environment, the Crab pulsar is by no means unique. The pulses of\nelectromagnetic radiation emitted by other pulsars contain only a fraction of the power which the\nneutron star is apparently releasing from its store of rotational energy. In several cases, nebular\nemission is observed to surround the pulsar, but, even where it is not, it is generally thought that\nmost of the spin-down power is carried away from the star by a relativistic wind consisting of a\nmixture of particles, waves and magnetic field. Attempts to provide a consistent description of this\nwind touch upon a fundamental problem in electrodynamics - the dichotomy between a single\nparticle approach and a continuum description. In the pulsar wind case, one can either start from\nthe solution describing a rotating magnetised object, compute individual particle trajectories and\ntreat their combined effect as a perturbation, or, alternatively, consider the particles as a fluid and\nconstruct, for example, a solution with an ideal MHD wind emerging from a magnetised rotating\nstar.\nIn the former case, it has been found that the wave component of the vacuum fields transfer\nenergy rapidly to the particles. The resulting damping is strong and the wave will not propagate\nif the particle density exceeds a critical value (Asseo et al 1978; Leboeuf et al 1982; Melatos &\nMelrose 1996). Since the particle density decreases as the radius increases, the vacuum wave-like\nsolution exists only outside a critical radius. In the fluid case, one faces the difficulty of formulating\na generalised Ohm's law. The simplest choice of infinite conductivity corresponds to ideal MHD,\nbut has the problem that it may imply currents too large to be carried by the finite number of\ncharged particles in the fluid. Given the structure of the magnetic field, the current densities can be\ncomputed from Amp\u00e8re's law. These generally decrease with radius less rapidly than the decrease\nin the density of charged particles available to carry the current (Usov 1975; Michel 1982). Since\nthe velocity of the current carriers cannot exceed that of light, the MHD approach is valid only\ninside a critical radius. Thus, there are theoretical methods to describe both the inner and the\nouter parts of a pulsar driven wind. However, as yet, no way has been found of linking these two\nregimes.\nIn the case of the Crab Nebula, observations suggest that the wind energy is dissipated into\nrelativistic particles at a radius r \u2248 109 rL , where rL = c/\u03a9 is the radius of the light cylinder and \u03a9\nthe angular velocity of the neutron star. The physics of this region (which we will term 'termination\nshock') is clearly an important problem. As a preliminary step, it is of interest to examine whether\nthe wind solutions enable one to make a statement about the properties of the flow immediately\nbefore entering the shock region. This is the problem we address in this paper. We discuss a highly\nsimplified non-axisymmetric ideal MHD wind - a 'striped wind' - and describe how a model\nof magnetic reconnection (Coroniti 1990; Michel 1994) modifies the wind dynamics (Lyubarsky &\nKirk 2001, henceforth LK). As a result, the range of validity of the MHD solution is extended.\nApplying the results to the Crab pulsar wind, we find that for sufficiently high particle densities\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe solution is valid up to the location of the termination shock. We then speculate that the crucial\nphysical process at work in the shock is the dissipation of the wave energy carried by the MHD\nwind.\n\n2.\n\nThe MHD wind\n\nAn exact analytic solution for an MHD pulsar wind has been found only for the idealised case\nof a monopole magnetic field in the force-free limit (Michel 1973). This solution has a very simple\nstructure: the flow does not collimate, i.e., both the velocity and the magnetic field have purely\nradial components in the meridional plane, B\u03b8 = 0, v\u03b8 = 0 and there exist no closed field lines. A\nmore realistic case would allow for closed field lines near the star, but, outside this region, it might\nbe expected that the flow along open field lines mimics the monopole case, perhaps with a modified\ndependence on latitude. The obvious inconsistency of using a magnetic monopole as a source can be\nlifted by introducing the 'split monopole'. In this case the system retains axial symmetry; the sign\nof each magnetic field component changes at the equator of the star, all other quantities remaining\nthe same. A current sheet is then implied, which lies in the equatorial plane and separates the\noppositely directed toroidal field components in the northern and southern hemispheres. It is also\npossible to lift the force-free approximation, replacing it by an ultra-relativistic approximation\n(Bogovalov 1997) to find that highly super-Alfv\u00e9nic, relativistic winds also collimate only very\nslightly and the radial velocity pattern remains a good approximation, even when particle inertia\nis taken into account (Beskin et al 1998; Chiueh et al 1998; Bogovalov & Tsinganos 1999).\nIn a radial wind, the outward pressure gradient exerted by the magnetic field is precisely\ncompensated by the inward tension force, so that the wind speed remains constant, as does the\nquantity \u03c3, defined as the ratio of the Poynting flux to the energy flux in particles. Thus, a\nsteady MHD wind driven by a magnetised neutron star carries energy predominantly in the form\nof Poynting flux, which is not converted into kinetic energy anywhere in the flow. This is a major\ndifficulty, because modelling of the synchrotron emission of the Crab Nebula (Rees & Gunn 1974;\nKennel & Coroniti 1984; Emmering & Chevalier 1987) suggests that if the wind terminates at a\nrelativistic MHD shock, the energy flux must be carried predominantly by particles.\nThe rotating neutron star of a pulsar does not have an axisymmetric magnetic field, so that\nan axisymmetric wind is quite possibly a poor approximation. Non-axisymmetric solutions are,\nof course, very much more difficult to find. Fortunately, however, the technique of replacing a\nmonopole source by a split monopole can also be used when the magnetic axis does not lie along\nthe rotation axis (Bogovalov 1999). The solution is essentially the same as in the monopole case:\nthe velocity field is unchanged, the pattern of the magnetic field lines is the same, but the direction\n(sign) of the field depends on the hemisphere in which the field line has its anchor point on the\nstar. The current sheet, which lies in the equatorial plane in the axisymmetric case, takes on the\nform of an outward moving, spiral corrugation, as shown in Fig. 1.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- The current sheet in the split-monopole solution for a radial relativistic wind. The sheet\nhas been truncated at a distance from the axis of 40rL , and a sector has been removed for clarity.\nThe wavelength of the corrugation is 2\u03c0rL . The upper figure displays the sheet for an inclination\nangle \u03c7 between the rotation and magnetic axes of 6o , the lower for an inclination angle of 26o .\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nIn the ultra-relativistic, highly super-Alfv\u00e9nic limit, the solution in terms of spherical polar\ncoordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is given by:\nur = \u03b2\u03b3L\nu\u03b8 = 0\nu\u03c6 = 0\n2\nBr = \u00b1B0 (rL /r) B\u03b8 = 0\nB\u03c6 = \u2213(rL sin \u03b8/\u03b2r)B0\nEr = 0\nE\u03b8 = \u2213B0 sin \u03b8(rL /r) E\u03c6 = 0\n\n(1)\n\n(Bogovalov 1999), where ur,\u03b8,\u03c6 are components of the four velocity, B and E are the magnetic and\nelectric fields and B0 is the magnitude of the radial component of B at the light cylinder, r = rL .\nThe signs of Br , B\u03c6 and E\u03b8 depend on whether the field line lies above (upper sign) or below (lower\nsign) the current sheet. Associated with this solution are distributed ('body') currents and charges\nas well as surface currents and charges located in the sheet. The body current is found from the\ncurl of B, (since the displacement current vanishes outside the sheet) and the body charge follows\nfrom Poisson's equation:\njr = \u2212 (cB0 cos \u03b8/2\u03c0\u03b2rL ) (rL /r)2 j\u03b8 = 0 j\u03c6 = 0\n\u03c1 = \u03b2jr /c\nThe current sheet is located at the position \u03a6(r) = 0, with\n\u0013\n\u0012\nr \u2212 \u03b2ct\n+\u03c6\n\u03a6 = cos \u03c7 cos \u03b8 + sin \u03c7 sin \u03b8 cos\n\u03b2rL\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c7 is the angle between the magnetic symmetry axis and the rotation axis and \u03b2c \u2248 c is the\n3-velocity of the wind. The surface current carried in the sheet is directed perpendicular to the\nadjacent magnetic field, and has the magnitude\nk=\n\nc[1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 (n\u0302 * r\u0302)2 ]\n|n\u0302 \u00d7 B|\n2\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere n\u0302 = \u2207\u03a6/|\u2207\u03a6| is a unit vector normal to the sheet [e.g., Jackson (1975), pp 20\u201322]. Except\nat points where the sheet normal is perpendicular to r\u0302, the surface current scales with 1/r, whereas\nthe body current scales according to jr \u221d 1/r 2 . The particle density in the wind drops off as\n1/r 2 , so that the charge carriers can maintain the body currents without an increase in velocity.\nTo maintain the surface currents, however, an increase with radius of either the surface density of\ncharge carriers, or of their velocity is required. The MHD solution fails if equation (4) requires a\ncurrent too large to be carried even if the particles contained in the sheet move at the speed of\nlight.\n\n3.\n\nReconnection\n\nAt large radius, the corrugated current sheet described above resembles locally, a set of concentric nested spheres, when viewed at latitudes close to the equator (|90o \u2212 \u03b8| \u226a \u03c7). The dynamics\nof the sheet may then be considered using a one-dimensional (radial) treatment. In the equatorial\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n\nB\n\nj\n0\n\n0\n\n2\u0019\n\nr=rL\n\n2\u0019N\n\n4\u0019\n\nFig. 2.- A schematic sketch of the radial structure of the magnetic field and current density in the\nwind far outside the light-cylinder (N \u226b 1). In the equatorial plane, the current sheets are equally\nspaced, as shown. However, except in the singular case \u03c7 = 90o , the intersheet spacing depends on\nthe magnetic polarity away from the equator and the sheets vanish altogether for |90o \u2212 \u03b8| > \u03c7\n.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nplane, the sheets of opposite polarity are evenly spaced. A sketch of the configuration at r \u226b rL is\nshown in Fig. 2.\nAccording to Amp\u00e8re's law, the integral of the current density across a current sheet is proportional to the change in magnetic field strength, measured in the comoving frame. In a radial wind,\nthe toroidal field drops as 1/r, and the particle density as 1/r 2 , when both quantities are measured\nin the lab. frame. Thus, in a wind of constant speed, the charge carriers in the sheet are forced\nto counter-stream with higher and higher velocities as the plasma moves outwards. This situation\nis likely to lead to instability, which could, in turn, provide an anomalous resistivity and hence\nmagnetic reconnection. Coroniti (1990) [see also Michel (1994)] proposed a simple picture intended\nto capture the physics of magnetic reconnection in the sheets. The suggestion is that the sheets\nattain a minimum thickness equal to the gyro-radius which a particle in the hottest part of the\nsheet would have, if it were moving in the magnetic field adjacent to the sheets. Equivalently (to\nwithin a factor of order unity), the thickness can be set by demanding that the maximum current\ndensity in the sheets is equal to the product of the particle density, the electronic charge and the\nvelocity of light. This enables one to formulate a system of equations for a wind that consists of\ntwo phases: a hot unmagnetised phase (corresponding to the current sheets) and a cold magnetised\nphase. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that, for an oblique rotator, the points at which a radius vector\ncuts the current sheet are equally spaced only in the equatorial plane. At other latitudes, the cold\nphase of one polarity dominates. In order to maintain pressure equilibrium, the magnetic field\nstrength in the cold phase must remain constant on the scale of a wavelength, so that the cold\nphase of the dominant polarity is thicker than that of the opposite polarity. At a critical latitude\n(\u03b8 = 90o \u2212 \u03c7) the radius vector grazes the current sheet, and for |90o \u2212 \u03b8| > \u03c7 the hot phase is\nabsent.\nIn Coroniti's original work, the density in the hot and cold phases was assumed equal. However, this leads to inconsistencies and an incorrect picture of the evolution of the wind. Recently,\nLyubarsky & Kirk (LK) have used a short wavelength approximation to analyse the evolution of the\npattern of hot and cold phases, which is simply an entropy wave in the wind plasma. Reconnection\nat the sheet boundaries starts at a certain radius r = rstart , which depends on how many particles\nare contained in the current sheet initially. The short wavelength approximation consists in assuming this radius to lie well outside the light-cylinder: \u03b5 \u2261 rL /rstart \u226a 1. The slow evolution of the\nwave is governed by a set of five equations. Three of these are conveniently written in differential\nform. These are the conservation of particle number and of energy,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2202 \b 2\nR \u03b30 v0 (1 \u2212 \u2206) n\u2032c + \u2206n\u2032h\n= 0\n\u2202R\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0002\n\u0003\nB \u20322\n\u2202\nR2 \u03b302 v0 mc2 (1 \u2212 \u2206) n\u2032c + \u2206n\u2032h + 2R2 \u03b302 v0 (1 + \u2206)\n= 0\n\u2202R\n8\u03c0\nand the entropy equation\n\u0001\n\u0001\n4\u2206B \u20322 \u2202\n\u2202\nR2 \u03b30 v0 + 3\u03b30 v0\n\u2206B \u20322 +\n2\nR \u2202R\n\u2202R\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\u0003 2\u03b30 B \u20322 (1 \u2212 \u2206) \u2202\nv0 \u2202 \u0002 2\n(Rv0 ) = 0 .\n\u03b30 (1 \u2212 \u2206) B \u20322 +\n\u03b30 \u2202R\nR\n\u2202R\n\n(7)\n\nHere, \u03b30 (R) and v0 (R) are the zeroth order (in terms of \u03b5) Lorentz factor and (3\u2013)velocity of the\nflow, the dimensionless radius variable is R = r/rstart , \u2206(R) is the fraction of a wavelength occupied\nby the sheets, n\u2032c (R) and n\u2032h (R) are the (zeroth order) proper number densities in the cold and hot\nphases, respectively, and B(R) = \u03b30 B \u2032 (R) is the (zeroth order) magnetic field in the cold phase\n(the prime indicates a quantity measured in the plasma rest frame).

The solution is specified by three parameters, for example, the Lorentz factor \u03b3L , the\nmultiplicity \u03ba and the ratio of the particle gyro frequency \u03c9L at r = rL to the rotation frequency\nof the pulsar \u03c9L /\u03a9. The values of the first two parameters are uncertain, but \u03c9L /\u03a9 is more or\nless directly accessible from observation and is, to within a factor of a few, equal to the potential\ndifference generated across open field lines, in units of the electron rest mass. (For the Crab pulsar\n\u03c9L /\u03a9 \u2248 1011 .) As an alternative to the multiplicity, one may use the magnetisation parameter \u03c3L ,\ndefined as the ratio at the light-cylinder of Poynting flux to particle energy flux in the cold phase\nof the wind, and related to the above parameters by \u03c3L = \u03c9L /(2\u03ba\u03b3L \u03a9). In addition, the initial\ncondition rrstart must be given.\nIn Fig. 3 we display an example of a solution appropriate for a pulsar that generates a maximum\npotential equal to that of the Crab pulsar: \u03c9L /\u03a9 = 1011 . The multiplicity is chosen to be \u03ba = 105 ,\nand the initial Lorentz factor is \u03b3L = 100, (corresponding to \u03c3L = 5000). Reconnection is assumed\nto commence at rstart = 100rL , i.e., \u03b5 = 0.01.

This range is determined by the surface\ndensity of charges assumed to be present in the quasi-spherical current sheets when they are first\nestablished. For r < rstart the current sheet contains a sufficient number of particles to supply the\nrequired current. Provided the initial surface density is small compared to the surface density of\nparticles in the cold, magnetised phase (i.e., the integral of nh over one wavelength) the sheets are\nable to maintain the required current at r > rstart by expanding and absorbing particles from the\ncold phase. In this way, the MHD picture of the wind retains validity, although the flow necessarily\ncontains non-ideal regions in which oppositely directed magnetic flux is steadily annihilated. The\nsolutions can be followed until the current sheets - as seen in the one-dimensional description -\nappear to merge. In the equatorial plane, this occurs at a radius given approximately by\n\u03c9L\nrL\n(15)\nrmax \u2248\n\u03a9\nand implies the complete annihilation of the magnetic field. Above and below the equatorial plane,\nthe current sheets are not equally spaced, and the total magnetic flux passing through one complete\nwavelength of the pattern is non-zero. Since this flux is conserved in our picture, reconnection leaves\nbehind a residual magnetic field, whose magnitude can be found from Eq. (3) and is\n\u0013\n\u0012\nrL BL 2 arccos(cot \u03c7 cot \u03b8)\n\u22121\n(16)\nBres =\nr\n\u03c0\nBeyond rmax , the 'current sheet' is no longer corrugated, but lies in the equatorial plane. Since\nthe toroidal magnetic field goes smoothly to zero as this plane is approached, the current it carries\nis proportional to the radial component of the field, which varies as r \u22122 . As in the axisymmetric,\nsplit-monopole case, the MHD picture is still valid, since the number of available particles is always\nsufficient to provide this current.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nHowever, there are two limitations which restrict the validity of this solution at large radius.\nThe first is the assumption, implicit in Eq. (9), that the electrons in the hot phase are relativistic.\nThis is a relatively minor technical limitation of the treatment, which is encountered for radii more\nthan a few percent of rmax . The second limitation is more subtle, and can be stated in a number of\nways. It also arises from Eq. (9). In prescribing the thickness of the sheet in terms of the densities\nin the two phases and the wind velocity, the movement of the sheet edge is decoupled from the\nlocal wave speeds, and can even move superluminally. Clearly, a physically realistic prescription\nwould involve, at the very least, an additional dissipation of energy into waves when the velocity\nof the sheet edge approaches c. This point is reached when\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03c0rL d\u2206\n= c\n(17)\nvedge = v0 1 +\n2 dr\nwhich can be written, using Eq. (12)\n\u2206 =\n\n2r\n\u03c0\u03b302 rL\n\n(18)\n\nTo within a factor of the order of unity, this is coincident with the limit discussed in LK [Eq. (36)].\nUsing the asymptotic solution, the critical distance rcr beyond which the solution fails is\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u0011\u22121\nL\n(19)\nrcr = 1.5 \u00d7 103 \u03ba4 rL\n\u03a9\nCombining this with equation (15), we find\nrcr\nrmax\n\n= 1.5 \u00d7 103 \u03ba4\n\n5.\n\n\u0010 \u03c9 \u0011\u22122\nL\n\n\u03a9\n\n(20)\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe inclusion of non-ideal MHD effects - albeit phenomenologically - results in a substantial\nextension beyond rstart of the range of validity of the 'inner' wind solution, which can be described\nusing a continuum picture. Starting with an entropy wave outside the light cylinder, this solution\ncan exist up to a maximum radius \u223c rmax (Eq. 15) and convert a substantial part of the total energy\np\nflux into bulk kinetic energy of the particles, provided \u03ba >\n\u223c 0.1 \u03c9L /\u03a9 [see eq. (20)]. The situation\nin the outer parts of the wind then resembles the axisymmetric, split monopole solution, except\nthat the magnitude of the toroidal component of the magnetic field passes smoothly through zero\np\non crossing the equatorial plane. However, if \u03ba <\n\u223c 0.1 \u03c9L /\u03a9, the solution loses validity at r \u223c rcr\n(Eq. 19) and the energy contained in the non-axisymmetric or (entropy) wave component must be\nchannelled into another type of wave and/or into the particles.\nIn reality, the wind driven by a pulsar is confined by the surrounding medium, which may\ndisrupt the solution either before reconnection is complete or before the MHD approach loses\nvalidity. Usually, disruption is envisaged to occur at a 'termination shock' where the flow makes\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nan abrupt transition from supersonic to subsonic velocity. In the case of the Crab Nebula, this\ntransition can be identified with a sharp increase in the synchrotron emissivity at a radius of\napproximately rshock \u2261 109 rL . The Crab pulsar has \u03c9L /\u03a9 = 1011 , so that, according to Eq. (15),\nrmax \u226b rshock and very little of the striped magnetic flux has time to reconnect. For the MHD\nsolution to remain valid up to rshock a minimum number of particles is required. From Eq. (19)\n4\nthis may be expressed as a condition on the multiplicity parameter: \u03ba >\n\u223c 1.6 \u00d7 10 . Assuming that\nthis condition is satisfied, the region r < rshock can be described by the striped MHD wind. Close\nto the equator, most of the energy flux is carried by the magnetic field of this entropy wave. If, in\nthis region, the termination shock is to dissipate a substantial fraction of the wind energy, it must\nnot only decelerate the wind to subsonic velocity, but also damp the oscillating component of the\nmagnetic field. This conclusion is consistent with the constraints from modelling the synchrotron\nemission of the nebula, which indicate that the energy density of the plasma downstream of the\nshock is not dominated by the magnetic field. The physics of such a transition is at present unclear,\nbut is likely to have profound implications for particle acceleration.\nWe are grateful to L. Ball, Y. Gallant, J. Kuijpers, A. Melatos and D.
