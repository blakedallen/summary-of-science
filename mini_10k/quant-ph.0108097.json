-dimensional quantum systems.\n\narXiv:quant-ph/0108097v1 22 Aug 2001\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) correlations, discovered in 1989, started a new chapter in the research\nrelated to entanglement. To a great extent this discovery was responsible for the sudden renewal in the interest\nin this field, both in theory and experiment. All these developments finally led to the first actual observation of\nthree qubit GHZ correlations in 1999 [1], and as a by product, since the experimental techniques involved were\nof the same kind, to the famous teleportation experiment [2].\nIn [3, 4] it has been shown that GHZ paradox can be extended to the correlations observed in quantum\nsystems consisting of N + 1 maximally entangled N -dimensional quantum objects (so called quN its), where\nN is an arbitrarily high integer number. The existence of the GHZ paradox for three maximally entangled\nthree dimensional quantum systems has been shown in [5]. It is worth mentioning that two different approaches\nhave been presented in [3, 4] to derive GHZ paradoxes. In [3] the series of paradoxes has been derived for\nthe correlation function that results from the correlations observed in so called unbiased symmetric multiport\nbeamsplitters (for the description of such devices see below) whereas [4] presents derivation based on the relations\nbetween operators.\nIn this paper we would like to show that GHZ-type paradoxes exist also in the case of correlations expected\nin gedanken experiments involving N maximally entangled quN its. This is an important question as the\nexistence of such paradoxes allows us to deeper understand the structure of quantum entanglement, which is the\nfundamental resource in quantum information as well as the nature of non-classicality of quantum correlations\n(by non-classicality we understand lack of local realistic description of such correlations; the alternative measure\nof non-classicality can be a measure based on the notion of non-separability).\nTo this end, we shall study a GHZ-Bell type experiment in which one has a source emitting N quN its in a\nspecific entangled state of the property, that the quN its propagate towards one of N spatially separated non\nconventional measuring devices operated by independent observers. Each of the devices consists of an unbiased\nsymmetric multiport beam splitter [6] (with N input and N exit ports), N phase shifters operated by the\nobservers (one in front of each input), and N detectors (one behind each exit port).\nII. UNBIASED MULTIPORT BEAMSPLITTERS\n\nAn unbiased symmetric 2N -port beam splitter is defined as an N -input and N -output interferometric device\nwhich has the property that a beam of light entering via single port is evenly split between all output ports.\nI.e., the unitary matrix defining such a device has the property that the modulus of all its elements equals \u221a1N .\nAn extended introduction to the physics and theory of such devices is given in [6]. Multiport beam splitters\nwere introduced into the literature on the EPR paradox in [10\u201312] in order to extend two qubit Bell-phenomena\nto observables described as operators in Hilbert spaces of the dimension higher than two. In contradistinction\nto the higher than 1/2 spin generalizations of the Bell-phenomena [13\u201319], this type of experimental devices\ngeneralize the idea of beam-entanglement [20\u201323]. Unbiased symmetric multiport beam splitters are performing\nunitary transformations between \"mutually unbiased\" bases in the Hilbert space [24\u201326]. They were tested in\nseveral recent experiments [27, 28], and also various aspects of such devices were analyzed theoretically [29, 30].\nWe shall use here only multiport beam splitters which have the property that the elements of the unitary\ntransformation which describes their action are given by\n1 (m\u22121)(m\u2032 \u22121)\nN\n,\n\u03b3N\nUm,m\n\u2032 = \u221a\nN\n\n(1)\n\n\u2032\nwhere \u03b3N = exp(i 2\u03c0\nN ) and the indices m, m denote the input and exit ports. Such devices were called in [6]\nthe Bell multiports.\n\n1\n\n\fIII. QUANTUM MECHANICAL PREDICTIONS\n\nAlthough in this paper we consider only the situation in which there is an equal number of observers and\ninput ports in each multiport beamsplitter it is instructive to derive necessary formulas for the more general\ncase in which there are M observers each operating 2N port beamsplitter. The initial M quN it state has the\nfollowing form:\nN M\n1 XY\n\u221a\n|mil ,\n|\u03c8(M )i =\nN m=1 l=1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere |mil describes the l-th quN it being in the m-th beam, which leads to the m-th input of the l-th multiport.\nPlease note, that only one quN it enters each multiport. However, each of the quN its itself is in a mixed state\n(with equal weights), which gives it equal probability to enter the local multiport via any of the input ports.\nThe state (2) seems to be the most straightforward generalization of the GHZ states to the new type of\nobservables. In the original GHZ states the number of their components (i.e., two) is equal to the dimension of\nthe Hilbert space describing the relevant (dichotomic) degrees of freedom of each of the quN its. This property\nis shared with the EPR-type states proposed in [6] for a two-multiport Bell-type experiment. In this case the\nnumber of components equals the number of input ports of each of the multiport beam splitters. We shall not\ndiscuss here the possible methods to generate such states. However, we briefly mention that the recently tested\nentanglement swapping [31\u201333] technique could be used for this purpose.\nAs it was mentioned earlier, in front of every input of each multiport beam splitter one has a tunable phase\nshifter. The initial state is transformed by the phase shifters into\nN M\n1 XY\n|\u03c8(M )\u2032 i = \u221a\nexp(i\u03c6m\nl )|mil ,\nN m=1 l=1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c6m\nl stands for the setting of the phase shifter in front of the m-th port of the l-th multiport.\nThe quantum prediction for probability to register the first photon in the output k1 of an 2N - port device,\nthe second one in the output k2 of the second such device ,. . ., and the M -th one in the output kM of the M -th\ndevice is given by:\n\n\u2032\n\nPQM (k1 , . . . , kM |\u03c6~1 , . . . , \u03c6~M ) =\nP\nPM m QM\n(m\u22121)(kn \u22121) 2\n| =\n( N1 )M+1 | N\nm=1 exp(i\nl=1 \u03c6l )\nn=1 \u03b3N\n\u0010\nh\n\u0011i\n\u2032\nP\nP\nN\nM\nm,m\n,\n= ( N1 )M+1 N + 2 m>m\u2032 cos\nl=1 \u2206\u03a6l,kl\n\n(4)\n\n2\u03c0\nm\u2032\n\u2032\n~\nwhere \u2206\u03a6m,m\n= \u03c6m\nl \u2212 \u03c6l + N (kl \u2212 1)(m \u2212 m ). The shorthand symbol \u03c6k stands for the full set of phase\nl,kl\nsettings in front of the k-th multiport, i.e. \u03c61k , \u03c62k , . . . , \u03c6N\nk .\nTo efficiently describe the local detection events let us employ a specific value assignment method (called\nBell number assignment; for a detailed explanation see again [6]), which ascribes to the detection event behind\nm\u22121\nthe m-th output of a multiport the value \u03b3N\n, where \u03b3N = exp(i 2\u03c0\nN ). With such a value assignment to the\ndetection events, the Bell-type correlation function, which is the average of the product of the expected results,\nis defined as\n\n=\n\nE(\u03c6~1 , * * * , \u03c6~M ) =\nQM kl \u22121\nP (k1 , * * * , kM |\u03c6~1 , * * * , \u03c6~M )\nk1 ,***,kM =1\nl=1 \u03b3N\n\nPN\n\n(5)\n\nand as we shall see for the quantum case it acquires particularly simple and universal form (which is the main\npurpose for using this non-conventional value assignment).\nThe easiest way to compute the correlation function for the quantum prediction employs the mid formula of\n(4):\nEQM (\u03c6~1 , * * * , \u03c6~M ) =\n\u0010 P\n\u0011\nP\nPN\nM\nm\nm\u2032\n= ( N1 )M+1 N\ni\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n)\nexp\n(\u03c6\n\u2032\nn\nn\nk1 ,***,kM =1\nm,m =1\nn=1\nQM (kl \u22121)(m\u2212m\u2032 +1)\n=\n\u00d7 l=1 \u03b3N\n\u0010 P\n\u0011\nP\nN\nm\nm\u2032\nexp\ni\n(\u03c6\n\u2212\n\u03c6\n)\n= ( N1 )M+1 N\n\u2032\nn\nn\nm,m =1\nn=1\nQM PN\n(kl \u22121)(m\u2212m\u2032 +1)\n\u00d7 l=1 kl =1 \u03b3N\n.\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\fPN\n(k \u22121)(m\u2212m\u2032 +1)\nNow, one notices that kl =1 \u03b3N l\ndiffers from zero (and equals to N) only if m \u2212 m\u2032 + 1 = 0 modulo\nN. Therefore we can finally write:\n=\n\n1\nN\n\n~1 , * * * , \u03c6\n~M )\nEQM (\u03c6\nPN\nPM m,m+1\n),\nm=1 exp(i\nl=1 \u03c6l\n\n(7)\n\nm+1\n+1\nwhere \u03c6m,m+1\n= \u03c6m\nand the above sum is modulo N, i.e., \u03c6N\n= \u03c61l .\nl \u2212 \u03c6l\nl\nl\nOne can notice here a striking simplicity and symmetry of this quantum correlation function (7). It is valid\nfor all possible values of M (number of quN its) and for all possible values of N \u2265 2 (number of ports). For\nN = 2, it reduces itself to the usual two qubit, and for N = 2, M P\n\u2265 2 the standard GHZ type multi-qubit\nM\ncorrelation function for beam-entanglement experiments, namely cos( l=1 \u03c61,2\nl ) [7]. The Bell-EPR phenomena\ndiscussed in [6] are described by (7) for M = 2, N \u2265 3.\nEven for N = 2, M = 1 the function (7) describes the following process. Assume that a traditional four-port\n50-50 beam splitter, is fed a single photon input in a state in which is an equal superposition of being in each of\nthe two input ports. The value of (7) is the average of expected photo counts behind the exit ports (provided\nthe click at one of the detectors is described as +1 and at the other one as \u22121), and of course it depends on\nthe relative phase shifts in front of the beam splitter. In other words, this situation describes a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer with a single photon input at a chosen input port. For N = 3, M = 1 the same interpretation\napplies to the case of a generalised three input, three output Mach-Zehnder interferometer described in [8],\n2\n3\nprovided one ascribes to firings of the three detectors respectively \u03b33 = \u03b1 \u2261 exp(i 2\u03c0\n3 ), \u03b1 and \u03b1 .\nThe described set of gedanken experiments is rich in EPR-GHZ correlations (for M \u2265 2). To reveal the\nabove, let us first analyze the conditions (i.e. settings) for such correlations. As the correlation function (7) is\n~1 , * * * , \u03c6\n~M )| \u2264 1. The equality signals a perfect\nan average of complex numbers of unit modulus, one has |EQM (\u03c6\nEPR-GHZ correlation. It is easy to notice that this may happen only if\n\nexp(i\n\nM\nX\n\n\u03c61,2\nl ) = exp(i\n\nl=1\n\nM\nX\nl=1\n\n\u03c62,3\nl ) = * * * = exp(i\n\nM\nX\n\nk\n\u03c6M,1\n) = \u03b3N\n,\nl\n\nl=1\n\n~1 , * * * , \u03c6\n~ M ) = \u03b3 k . This means that only those\nwhere k is an arbitrary natural number. Under this condition E(\u03c6\nN\nsets of M spatially separated detectors may fire, which are ascribed such Bell numbers having the property that\nk\ntheir product is \u03b3N\n. Knowing, which detectors fired in the set of M \u2212 1 observation stations, one can predict\nwith certainty which detector would fire at the sole observation station not in the set.\n\nIV. GHZ PARADOXES FOR N MAXIMALLY ENTANGLED QUN ITS.\n\nNow we show the derivation of GHZ paradoxes for N maximally entangled quN its. However, first it is\ninstructive to consider the simplest case, which is three qutrits. The correlation function for such an experiment\nreads\n~1 , \u03c6\n~2 , \u03c6\n~3 )\nEQM (\u03c6\n!\n3\n3\nX\n1X\nexp i\n(\u03c6kl \u2212 \u03c6k+1\n) .\n=\nl\n3\nk=1\n\n(8)\n\nl=1\n\nThe experimenters perform three distinctive experiments. In the first run of the experiment we allow the\n~1 = \u03c6\n~ 2 = (0, \u03c0 , 2\u03c0 ) = \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~ 3 = (0, 0, 0) =\nobservers to choose the following settings of the measuring apparatus, \u03c6\n3 3\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n\u03c6 in the second run they choose \u03c62 = \u03c63 = \u03c6, \u03c61 = \u03c6 whereas in the third run they fix the local settings of\n~1 = \u03c6\n~ 3 = \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~2 = \u03c6\n~\u2032.\ntheir tritters on \u03c6\nNow, let us calculate the numerical values of the correlation function for each experimental situation. We\neasily find that for all three experiments this value, due to the special form of the correlation function, is the\nsame and reads\n~ \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~ \u2032 ) = EQM (\u03c6\n~\u2032 , \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6)\n~ = EQM (\u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~\u2032 , \u03c6)\n~\nEQM (\u03c6,\n2\u03c0\n= exp(\u2212i ) = \u03b12 ,\n3\ni.e., we observe perfect correlations.\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fThe (deterministic) local hidden variable correlation function for this type of experiment must have the\nfollowing structure [9]:\n~1 , \u03c6\n~2 , \u03c6\n~3) =\nEHV (\u03c6\n\nZ Y\n3\n\n~k , \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb.\nIk (\u03c6\n\n(10)\n\n\u039b k=1\n\n~k , \u03bb), which determines the firing of the detectors behind the k-th multiport,\nThe hidden variable function Ik (\u03c6\ndepends only upon the local set of phases, and takes one of the three possible values \u03b1, \u03b12 , \u03b13 = 1 (these values\nindicate which of the detectors is to fire), and \u03c1(\u03bb) is the distribution of hidden variables. The local realistic\ndescription of the experiment is only possible if the local hidden variable correlation function defined above\nequals that of quantum ones for the given set of phase shifts.\nBecause in each experiment described above we observe perfect correlations, i.e., the quantum mechanical\n~ \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~\u2032 ) =\ncorrelation function takes value \u03b12 , the local realistic description is possible if and only if one has EHV (\u03c6,\n~\u2032 , \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6)\n~ = EHV (\u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~ \u2032 , \u03c6)\n~ = \u03b12 . Taking into account the structure of local hidden variable correlation\nEHV (\u03c6\nfunction one obtains the set of three equations\n~ \u03bb)I2 (\u03c6,\n~ \u03bb)I3 (\u03c6\n~\u2032 , \u03bb) = \u03b12\nI1 (\u03c6,\n~\u2032 , \u03bb)I2 (\u03c6,\n~ \u03bb)I3 (\u03c6,\n~ \u03bb) = \u03b12\nI1 (\u03c6\n~ \u03bb)I2 (\u03c6\n~\u2032 , \u03bb)I3 (\u03c6,\n~ \u03bb) = \u03b12\nI1 (\u03c6,\n\n(11)\n\nAfter multiplication of the above equations one arrives at:\n3\nY\n\n~\u2032 , \u03bb)\nIk (\u03c6\n\nk=1\n\n3\nY\n\n~ \u03bb)2 = (\u03b12 )3 = 1,\nIk (\u03c6,\n\n(12)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich can be also written in the following form\n3\nY\n\n~\u2032 , \u03bb) =\nIk (\u03c6\n\nk=1\n\n3\nY\n\n~ \u03bb).\nIk (\u03c6,\n\n(13)\n\nk=1\n\n~ \u03bb)2 = Ik (\u03c6,\n~ \u03bb)\u2217 for every \u03bb. However, because\nWe have used the property of the hidden variable functions: Ik (\u03c6,\n\u2032 ~\u2032 ~ \u2032\n~\nEQM (\u03c6 , \u03c6 , \u03c6 ) = 1 we must also have\n3\nY\n\n~\u2032 , \u03bb) = 1,\nIk (\u03c6\n\n(14)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich, because of (13), gives\n3\nY\n\n~ \u03bb) = 1\nIk (\u03c6,\n\n(15)\n\nk=1\n\nfor every \u03bb. This in turn implies that\n~ \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6)\n~ = 1,\nEQM (\u03c6,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich means that local hidden variables predict perfect correlations for the experiment when all observers set\n~ However, the quantum prediction is that\ntheir local settings at \u03c6.\n~ \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6)\n~ = \u22121.\nEQM (\u03c6,\n3\n\n(17)\n\nTherefore, we have the contradiction: 1 = \u2212 31 .\nThis contradiction is of the different type than the one derived in [3] although it has been obtained in the\nsimilar way, i.e., the perfect correlations have been used to derive it (equations (11) and (12)). Here local hidden\nvariables imply a certain perfect correlation, which is not predicted by quantum mechanics, whereas in [3] as\nwell as in [4] the contradiction is that both theories predict perfect correlations but of the different type.\nNow, we employ the above procedure for the case when we have an arbitrary odd number of multiports and\nquN its N = 2m + 1. As we have seen in in the above derivation the crucial point is to find the proper phases\n4\n\n\f~1 = \u03c6\n~2 = \u03c6\n~3 = ... =\nfor the multiports. Let us choose for the first gedanken experiment the following ones \u03c6\n2\u03c0\n2m\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u2032\n~\n~\n~\n~\n\u03c62m = (0, 2m+1 , 2m+1 , . . . , 2m+1 ) = \u03c6, \u03c62m+1 = (0, 0, ..., 0) = \u03c6 .\nAs before, in the next run of the experiment we choose the same phases but we change the role of observers\n~\u2032 while the rest of them choose \u03c6,\n~ in the third run the third one\nsuch that in the second run the first one chooses \u03c6\n\u2032\n~\n~\nchooses \u03c6 while the rest of them choose \u03c6, etc. Again, the value of the correlation function for each experiment\nis the same\n~ ...,\u03c6\n~ \u2032 ) = EQM (\u03c6\n~\u2032 , . . . , \u03c6)\n~ = . . . = EQM (\u03c6,\n~ ...,\u03c6\n~ \u2032 , \u03c6)\n~\nEQM (\u03c6,\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n2\n2m\u03c0\n4m \u03c0\n1\n\u2212m\n2m exp \u2212i\n+ exp i\n= \u03b3N\n=\n2m + 1\n2m + 1\n2m + 1\n\n(18)\n\n~1 , . . . , \u03c6\n~N ) =\nUsing (18) and the structure of the hidden variables correlation function, i.e., EHV (\u03c6\nR QN\nQ\nN\n\u22121\n\u2212m\n\u2032\n~\n~\n~\n(l = 1, 2, . . . , N ).\nk=1 Ik (\u03c6k , \u03bb)\u03c1(\u03bb)d\u03bb, we arrive at the set of N equations Il (\u03c6 , \u03bb)\nk6=l Ik (\u03c6, \u03bb) = \u03b3N\n\u039b\nAfter multiplying them by each other we obtain\n2m+1\nY\nk=1\n\n~\u2032 , \u03bb) =\nIk (\u03c6\n\n2m+1\nY\n\n~ \u03bb)\u22122m =\nIk (\u03c6,\n\nk=1\n\n2m+1\nY\n\n~ \u03bb)\nIk (\u03c6,\n\n(19)\n\nk=1\n\n~\u2032 , . . . , \u03c6\n~\u2032 ) = 1 one must have Q2m+1 Ik (\u03c6\n~\u2032 , \u03bb) = 1, which according to (19)\nfor every \u03bb. Because EQM (\u03c6\nk=1\nQ2m+1\n~ \u03bb) = 1 for every \u03bb. Thus, local hidden variables imply the following perfect correlation\ngives k=1 Ik (\u03c6,\n~\n~\nEQM (\u03c6, . . . , \u03c6) = 1, whereas quantum mechanics gives\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1\n2m + 1\n(2m + 1)2m\n\u22122m + 1\n~\n~\nEQM (\u03c6, ..., \u03c6) =\n2m exp \u2212i\n\u03c0 + exp i\n\u03c0\n=\n.\n(20)\n2m + 1\n2m + 1\n2m + 1\n2m + 1\nTherefore, for each m one obtains the untrue identity 1 = \u22122m+1\n2m+1 , which in the limit of m \u2212\u2192 \u221e becomes\n1 = \u22121.\nFor the even number of quN its and the multiports N = 2m (m \u2265 2) we choose the following phases:\n~1 = \u03c6\n~2 = \u03c6\n~3 = . . . = \u03c6\n~ N \u22121 = (0, \u03c0 , 2\u03c0 , . . . , (2m\u22121)\u03c0 ) = \u03c6,\n~ \u03c6\n~ N = (0, 0, ..., 0) = \u03c6~\u2032 .

CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have derived the series of paradoxes in which the number of observers and the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace describing each subsystem is the same. The derivation of the paradoxes relies on the perfect correlations\nobserved in the system but the resulting contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism manifests\nitself in the fact that local realism predicts a certain perfect correlation whereas quantum mechanics does not.\nAn interesting feature of the paradoxes is that they naturally split into two parts: the even and the odd\nnumber of observers (input ports). In each part the final contradiction has different numerical values. All\nparadoxes do not vanish with the growing dimension N of the Hilbert space of each quN it.\nFurthermore, for the case of two observers one cannot derive the GHZ paradoxes with the method presented\nhere (for this case we have so called Hardy paradox but for non-maximally entangled state [35]).\n5\n\n\fIn conclusion we state that the multiport beam splitters, and the idea of value assignment based Bell numbers,\nlead to a strikingly straightforward generalisation of the GHZ paradox for N entangled quN its. These properties may possibly find an application in future quantum information and communication schemes (especially as\nGHZ states are now observable in the lab [1]).\nAcknowledgements\nMZ and DK are supported by the KBN grant No. 5 P03B 088 20.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n\nD.
