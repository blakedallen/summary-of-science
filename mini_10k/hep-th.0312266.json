BPS\nstates preserving k out of 32 supersymmetries are denoted \u03bd = k/32 states; k = 32 corresponds to fully supersymmetric vacua. The observation [1] (see also Sec. II)\nthat BPS states that break 32 \u2212 k supersymmetries can\nbe treated as composites of those preserving all but one\nsupersymmetries, suggests that the k = 31 states might\nbe considered as fundamental constituents of M-theory.\nThese \u03bd = 31/32 BPS states were accordingly named\nBPS preons [1].\nInterestingly enough, the notion of BPS preons may\nbe extended to arbitrary dimensions, including D = 4.\nIn this case, a point\u2013like BPS preon may be identified\nwith a tower of massless higher spin fields of all possible\nhelicities (see [2, 3], [4] and refs. therein).\nThe actual existence of preonic, \u03bd = 31/32 supersymmetric, BPS states as solitonic solutions of the standard\nCremmer\u2013Julia\u2013Scherk (CJS) D = 11 supergravity [5]\nhas been the subject of recent studies [6, 7]. Although\nno obstructions for their existence have been found by\ngeometric considerations based on the notion of generalized holonomy [6] (see also [8, 9, 10, 11]), no \u03bd = 31/32\nsolutions were found either.\nIn this paper we develop the notion of BPS preons to\nanalyze the various supersymmetric solutions of the supergravity equations. A \u03bd = k/32 supersymmetric solution corresponds to a BPS state composed of n = (32\u2212k)\nBPS preons. The corresponding (32 \u2212 k) bosonic spinors\n\u03bb\u03b1 r (r = 1, . . . , n) are orthogonal to the k Killing spinors\n\u01ebJ \u03b1 characterizing the \u03bd = k/32 solution,\n\u01ebJ \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 r = 0 ,\n\u03b1 = 1, . . . , 32 , J = 1, . . . , k ,\n\n(1)\nr = 1, . . . , (32 \u2212 k) .\n\nThus, BPS preonic spinors and Killing spinors provide an\n\nalternative (dual) characterization of a \u03bd-supersymmetric\nsolution; either one can be used and, for solutions with\nsupernumerary supersymmetries [12, 13], the characterization provided by BPS preons is a more economic one.\nMoreover, the use of both BPS preonic (\u03bb\u03b1 r ) and Killing\n(\u01ebJ \u03b1 ) spinors allows us to develop (in Sec. II) a moving\nG\u2013frame method, which may be useful in the search for\nnew supersymmetric solutions of CJS supergravity.\n\nWe apply this moving G\u2013frame method (in Sec. III,\nG = SL(32, R)) to studying the generalized holonomies\nof CJS supergravity and discuss the basic equations characterizing the still hypothetical BPS preonic solutions\n(Sec. IV B, G = GL(32, R), SL(32, R) or Sp(32, R)).\nAlthough no definite answer to the question of the existence of BPS preonic solutions for the standard CJS\nsupergravity is given here, we do show (in Sec. IV A)\nthat \u03bd = 31/32 supersymmetric preonic configurations\nsolve the equations in the Chern-Simons (CS) supergravity case [14] (for a review, see [15]) i.e., that CS supergravity does have preonic solutions.\n\nUsing the recent results [16, 17] on a gauge-fixed form\nof the action for dynamical supergravity interacting with\ndynamical superbrane sources (see Sec. IV C), we also\npropose (in Sec. IV D) a D = 11 worldvolume action\nfor BPS preons in the background of a D'Auria\u2013Fr\u00e9\nOSp(1|32)\u2013related supergravity [18] (see also [19]), a\nmodel allowing for an economic 'embedding' of the standard D = 11 CJS supergravity.\n\nIn this paper we use a 'mostly minus' metric, \u03b7ab =\n(+, \u2212, . . . , \u2212); the exterior derivative d acts from the\n1\nright, d\u03a9q = q!\ndx\u03bcq \u2227 * * * \u2227 dx\u03bc1 \u2227 dx\u03bd \u2202\u03bd \u03a9\u03bc1 ***\u03bcq .\n\n\f2\nA.\n\nEquations of D = 11 supergravity\n\nThe purely bosonic limit of the 'free' CJS supergravity\nequations is given by\n1\n1\nEab := Rab \u2212 Fa[3] Fb [3] + \u03b7ab F[4] F [4] = 0 , (2)\n3\n36\nG8 := d \u2217 F4 \u2212 F4 \u2227 F4 = 0 ,\n(3)\ndF4 \u2261 0\n\u21d4\nF4 = dA3 ,\n(4)\nwhich include the Einstein equations with a contribution\nfrom the energy\u2013momentum tensor of the antisymmetric\ngauge field A\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 (x) only, Eq. (2), as well as the free equations (3) and Bianchi identities (4) for the gauge field in\ncurved D = 11 spacetime.

Such equations\npossess nonsingular pp\u2013wave solutions with supernumerary supersymmetries [12, 13].\nAs the supergravity multiplet is the only one without\nhigher spin fields in D = 11, no usual field-theoretical\n(spacetime) matter contribution to the r.h.s.'s of Eqs.\n(2), (3), (4) may appear. However, these equations might\nbe modified by higher order corrections in curvature [20,\n21] (a counterpart of the string \u03b1\u2032 corrections [22] in D =\n10, see also [23]), or/and by the presence of sources from\np\u2013branes.\nThe \u03bd = 16/32 supersymmetric M2\u2013brane solution of\nD = 11 supergravity (see [24, 25] and refs. therein) possesses a singularity on the (2 + 1)-dimensional worldvolume surface W 2+1 \u2282 M 11 , x\u03bc = x\u0302\u03bc (\u03be) \u2261 x\u0302\u03bc (\u03c4, \u03c3 1 , \u03c3 2 )\n(a caret indicates a function of the worldvolume coordinates). In other words, it solves the Einstein field\nequation Eab = Tab \u2212 19 \u03b7ab Tc c with a singular energy\u2013\nmomentum tensor density Tab \u221d \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 x\u0302(\u03be)) [42]. The\ngauge field equation also possesses a singular contribution\nJ8 in the r.h.s., G8 = J8 , similar to that of the electric\ncurrent to the r.h.s. of Maxwell equations. In this sense,\nthe M2\u2013brane carries a supergravity counterpart of the\nelectric charge in Maxwell electrodynamics (see [26] for\na discussion).\nThe other basic \u03bd = 16/32 supersymmetric solution of\nthe CJS supergravity, the M5-brane (see [24, 25, 27] and\nrefs. therein), is a counterpart of Dirac monopole, i.e. of\nthe magnetically charged particle. It is characterized by\na modification of the Bianchi identities (Eq. (4)) with the\nanalogue of a magnetic current in the r.h.s., dF4 = J5 .\n\nThe coincident M\u2013brane solutions still possess \u03bd =\n16/32 supersymmetry, while the intersecting brane solutions correspond to \u03bd < 16/32. Thus, as supernumerary supersymmetric solutions (\u03bd > 1/2) are known only\nfor 'free' CJS, it is reasonable to consider first the 'free'\nbosonic CJS equations (2)\u2013(4), (6), (7) in the search for\na hypothetical BPS preonic, \u03bd = 31/32 solution.\nNotice, however, that one should not exclude the possible existence of a brane solution [i.e. solutions of\nEab = Tab \u2212 19 \u03b7ab Tc c with a Tab \u221d \u03b4 p+1 (x\u2212 x\u0302(\u03be))] with supernumerary supersymmetries, although certainly these\nsolutions would describe quite unusual branes. The reason why the 'standard' brane solutions (like M\u2013waves,\nM2 and M5\u2013branes in D = 11) always break 1/2 of the\nsupersymmetry is that their \u03ba\u2013symmetry projector (the\nbosonic part of which is identical to the projector defining the preserved supersymmetries [28, 29]) has the form\n(1 \u2212 \u0393\u0304) with tr\u0393\u0304 = 0, \u0393\u03042 = I. However, worldvolume actions for branes with a different form for the \u03ba\u2013symmetry\nprojector are known [4, 30, 31] although in an enlarged\nsuperspace (see [32]). A question arises, whether such\nactions may be written in usual spacetime or superspace.\nAs a partial answer to this question, we present here\na D = 11 spacetime action for a BPS preon in the background of a D'Auria\u2013Fr\u00e9 type supergravity [18]. The\nexperience provided by the usual D = 11 M\u2013branes and\nD = 10 D-branes together with the analysis [16, 17] of\nthe partial preservation of local supersymmetry by the\npurely bosonic limit of the super\u2013p\u2013brane action suggests\nthat the existence of such a preonic action implies that\n\u03bd = 31/32 solitons should exist in a D'Auria\u2013Fr\u00e9 type\nmodel.\nB.\n\nKilling spinors, generalized connection and\ngeneralized holonomy\n\nA bosonic solution of the CJS supergravity equations\npreserving k out of 32 supersymmetries can be characterized by k independent bosonic spinors (Killing spinors),\n\u01ebJ \u03b1 (x), J = 1, . . . , k, obeying the Killing spinor equation\nD\u01ebJ \u03b1 = d\u01ebJ \u03b1 \u2212 \u01ebJ \u03b2 \u03c9\u03b2 \u03b1 = 0 .\n\n(8)\n\nThe generalized connection \u03c9\u03b2 \u03b1 in (8) includes, besides\nab\nthe Lorentz (spin) connection \u03c9L\u03b2 \u03b1 = 1/4\u03c9L\n\u0393ab\u03b2 \u03b1 , a\ntensorial part t\u03b2 \u03b1 = \u03c9\u03b2 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c9L\u03b2 \u03b1 constructed from the\nfield strength Fabcd , Eqs.

(7)) that requires \u03b4\u03b5 \u03c8\u03bc\u03b1 = D\u03bc \u03b5\u03b1 =\n0. In OSp(1|32)\u2013related supergravity models, including\nCS\u2013type supergravities [14], D\u03bc and, hence, the Killing\n\n\f3\nspinor equation involves a sp(32)\u2013valued \u03c9\u03b2 \u03b1 connection\n(\u03c9 \u03b2\u03b1 := C \u03b2\u03b3 \u03c9\u03b3 \u03b1 = \u03c9 (\u03b2\u03b1) ) which is a true connection\ni.e., it is associated with the actual gauge symmetry of\nthe model.\nIn CJS supergravity, as well as in type IIB D =\n10 supergravity, the gauge symmetry is restricted to\nSO(1, 10), and \u03c9 in Eq. (9) is not a true connection.\nHowever, the selfconsistency (integrability) condition for\n(8), DD\u01ebJ \u03b1 = 0 has the suggestive form [6, 8],\n\u01ebJ \u03b2 R\u03b2 \u03b1 = 0 ,\n\n(10)\n\nin terms of the generalized curvature\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u03b1\n\nR\u03b2 = d\u03c9\u03b2 \u2212 \u03c9\u03b2 \u2227 \u03c9\u03b3 .\n\n(11)\n\nEqs. (8), (10) formally possess a GL(32, R) gauge invariance with \u03c9 transforming as a GL(32, R) connection.\nHowever, GL(32, R) is not a gauge invariance of CJS supergravity, hence the name 'generalized' connection and\ncurvature for \u03c9 and R.\nNotice that, in contrast, a rigid GL(k, R) transformation acting on the index I results in a redefinition of the\nKilling spinors \u01ebI \u03b1 i.e., in replacing the Killing spinors\nby independent linear combinations with constant coefficients. This is clearly allowed and GL(k, R) can be\ntreated as a rigid symmetry of the system of k Killing\nspinors characterizing the \u03bd = k/32 supersymmetric solution of any model.\n\nA true connection takes values in the Lie algebra G\nof the structure group G of the principal fiber bundle.\nThe curvature may take values in a smaller subalgebra\nH \u2282 G which is associated with a proper subgroup H \u2282 G\nof the structure group, the holonomy group. For generalized connections \u03c9 one may accordingly introduce the\nnotion of generalized holonomy group H \u2282 G [6] (see also\n[7, 8, 10]), such that R\u03b2 \u03b1 \u2208 H (while \u03c9\u03b2 \u03b1 \u2208 G). In\nthis light, the necessary condition for the existence of k\nKilling spinors, Eq. (10), can be treated as a restriction\non the generalized holonomy group H [6, 7, 10, 11, 13].\nIt has been shown that for both CJS D = 11 supergravity [7] and for type IIB supergravity [11], the generalized holonomy group H is a subgroup of SL(32, R), H \u2282\nSL(32, R). As the generalized connections are clearly\ntraceless in both cases, one also has G \u2282 SL(32, R).\nFor OSp(1|32)\u2013related models including CS supergravities [14] the (true) structure group is G \u2282 Sp(32, R) and\nthe holonomy group is H \u2282 Sp(32, R).\nA full expression for the generalized curvature R\u03b1 \u03b2\ncorresponding to purely bosonic solutions of CJS supergravity may be found e.g., in [9, 33] (see Appendix B\nof [9] and refs. therein; there, \u03b7ab and F correspond to\n\u2212\u03b7ab , \u22122F ).

As it was noted in Sec. I A, this problem\ncan be addressed step by step, beginning by studying the\nexistence of preonic solutions for 'free' bosonic CJS equations. To this aim it is useful to observe [9] that these\nequations may be collected in a compact expression for\nthe generalized curvature, Eq. (14). The generalized curvature of a BPS preonic configuration satisfies Eq. (54),\nand thus it solves the 'free' bosonic CJS supergravity\nequations (14) if\nia dB I \u01ebI \u03b1 \u0393a \u03b1 \u03b2 = 0 .\n\nActually, Eq. (54) in Eq. (14) gives \u03bb\u03b1 ia dB I \u01ebI \u03b3 \u0393a \u03b3 \u03b2 =\n0. However, as \u03bb\u03b1 6= 0, this is equivalent to Eq. (59).\nEq. (59) contains a summed I = 1, . . . , 31 index\nand, as a result, it is not easy to handle. It would\nbe much easier to deal with the expression \u0393a \u03b1 \u03b3 ia R\u03b3 \u03b2\nwhich, with Eq. (54) is equal to \u0393a \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03bb\u03b3 ia dB J \u01ebJ \u03b2 . Indeed, (\u0393a \u03bb)\u03b1 ia dB J \u01ebJ \u03b2 = 0, for instance, would imply\n(\u0393a \u03bb)\u03b1 ia dB J = 0 which may be shown to have only trivial solutions. However, \u0393a \u03b1 \u03b3 ia R\u03b3 \u03b2 6= 0 in general for a\nsolution of the 'free' bosonic CJS equations (Eq. (14)),\n\u0011\ni \u0010\n\u0393a \u03b1 \u03b3 ia R\u03b3 \u03b2 = \u2212\nDF\u0302\u03b1 \u03b2 + O(F F ) ,\n(60)\n12\na\nwhere D = e Da is the Lorentz covariant derivative [not\nto be confused with D defined in Eqs.

(63) or, equivalently, Eqs. (64),(65) are the equations\nto be satisfied by a CJS preonic configuration. Note that\nif a nontrivial solution of the above equations with some\nFabcd 6= 0 and some dB I 6= 0 is found, one would have\nthen to check in particular that such a solution satisfies\nddB I = 0 and D[e Fabcd] = 0.\nOn the other hand, if the general solution of the above\nequation turned out to be trivial, dB I = 0, this would\nimply R\u03b1 \u03b2 = 0 and, thus, a trivial generalized holonomy\ngroup, H = 1. However, this is the necessary condition\nfor fully supersymmetric, k = 32, solutions [8]. Hence a\ntrivial solution for Eqs. (64), (65) would indicate that\na solution preserving 31 supersymmetries possesses all\n32 ones (thus corresponding to a fully supersymmetric\nvacuum) and, hence, that there are no preonic, \u03bd = 31/32\n\n\f8\nsolutions of the free bosonic CJS supergravity equations\n(2), (3), (4), (6) and (7).\nIf this happened to be the case, one would have to\nstudy the existence of preonic solutions for the CJS supergravity equations with nontrivial right hand sides.\nThese could be produced by corrections of higher\u2013order\nin curvature [20, 21, 23] (a counterpart of the string \u03b1\u2032\ncorrections in D = 10 [22]) and by the presence of sources\n(from some exotic p\u2013branes).\n\nC.\n\nOn brane solutions and worldvolume actions\n\nAs far as supersymmetric p\u2013brane solutions of supergravity equations are concerned, one notices that for\nmost of the known \u03bd = 1/2 supersymmetric solutions\n(\u03bd = 16/32 in D = 11 and D = 10 type II cases)\nthere also exist worldvolume actions in the corresponding (D = 11 or D = 10 type II) superspaces possessing\n16 \u03ba-symmetries, exactly the number of supersymmetries\npreserved by the supergravity solitonic solutions. The \u03ba\u2013\nsymmetry\u2013preserved supersymmetry correspondence was\nfurther discussed and extended for the case of \u03bd < 1/2\nmulti-brane solutions in [28, 29].\nIn this perspective one may expect that if preonic\n\u03bd = 31/32 supersymmetric solutions of the CJS equations with a source do exist, a worldvolume action possessing 31 \u03ba\u2013symmetries should also exist in a curved\nD = 11 superspace. For a moment no such actions are\nknown in the standard D = 11 superspace, but they are\nknown in a superspace enlarged with additional tensorial\n'central' charge coordinates [30, 31]. One might expect\nthat the r\u00f4le of these additional tensorial coordinates\ncould be taken over by the tensorial fields of D = 11\nsupergravity. But this would imply that the corresponding action does not exist in the flat standard D = 11\nsuperspace as it would require a contribution from the\nabove additional field degrees of freedom (replacing the\ntensorial coordinate ones corresponding to spirit of [32]).\nThis lack of a clear flat standard superspace limit hampers the way towards a hypothetical worldvolume action\nfor a BPS preon in the usual curved D = 11 superspace.\nNevertheless, a shortcut in the search for such an action may be provided by the recent observation [17] that\nthe superfield description of the dynamical supergravity\u2013\nsuperbrane interacting system, described by the sum of\nthe superfield action for supergravity (still unknown for\nD = 10, 11) and the super\u2013p\u2013brane action, is gauge\nequivalent to the much simpler dynamical system described by the sum of the spacetime, component action\nfor supergravity and the action for the purely bosonic\nlimit of the super\u2013p\u2013brane. This bosonic p\u2013brane action\ncarries the memory of being the bosonic limit of a super\u2013\np\u2013brane by still possessing 1/2 of the spacetime local supersymmetries [16]; this preservation of local supersymmetry reflects the \u03ba\u2013symmetry of the original super\u2013p\u2013\nbrane action.\nThus the \u03ba-symmetric worldvolume actions for super\u2013\n\np\u2013branes have a clear spacetime counterpart: the purely\nbosonic actions in spacetime possessing a part of local\nspacetime supersymmetry of a 'free' supergravity theory.\nThis fact, although explicitly discussed for the standard, \u03bd = 1/2 superbranes in [17], is general since it\nfollows from symmetry considerations only and thus it\napplies to any superbrane, including a hypothetical preonic one. The number of supersymmetries possessed by\nthis bosonic brane action coincides with the number of\n\u03ba\u2013symmetries of the parent super\u2013p\u2013brane action. Moreover, these supersymmetries are extracted by a projector\nwhich may be identified with the bosonic limit of the \u03ba\u2013\nsymmetry projector for the superbrane. With this guideline in mind one may simplify, in a first stage, the search\nfor a worldvolume action for a BPS preon in standard supergravity (or in a model minimally extending the standard supergravity) by discussing the bosonic limit that\nsuch a hypothetical action should have.\n\nD.\n\nBPS preons in D'Auria\u2013Fr\u00e9 supergravity\n\nLet us consider a symmetric spin\u2013tensor one\u2013form\ne\u03b1\u03b2 = e\u03b2\u03b1 = dx\u03bc e\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc (x) transforming under local supersymmetry by\n\u03b4\u03b5 e\u03b1\u03b2 = \u22122i\u03c8 (\u03b1 \u03b5\u03b2) ,\n\n(66)\n\nwhere \u03c8 \u03b1 is a fermionic one\u2013form,\n\u03c8 \u03b1 = dx\u03bc \u03c8\u03bc\u03b1 (x) ,\n\n(67)\n\nwhich we may identify with the gravitino. Let us consider\nfor simplicity the worldline action (cf. [30])\nS =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u03bb\u03b2 (\u03c4 )\u00ea\u03b1\u03b2\n\nW1\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\nd\u03c4 \u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u03bb\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) e\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc (x\u0302(\u03c4 )) \u2202\u03c4 x\u0302 (\u03c4 ) ,\n\n(68)\n\nwhere \u03c4 parametrizes the worldline W 1 in D = 11 spacetime, \u00ea\u03b1\u03b2 := d\u03c4 \u2202\u03c4 x\u0302\u03bc (\u03c4 ) e\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc (x\u0302(\u03c4 )) and \u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) is an auxiliary spinor field on the worldline W 1 . The extended\n(p \u2265 1) object counterpart of this worldline action is the\nfollowing action for tensionless p\u2013branes (cf. [31])\nSp+1 =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b2 \u03c1\u0302 \u2227 \u00ea\u03b1\u03b2\n\nW p+1\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\ndp+1 \u03be \u03c1k \u03bb\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b2 \u00ea\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03bc \u2202k x\u0302 ,\n\n(69)\n\nW p+1\n\nwhere \u03c1\u0302(\u03be) is a p-form auxiliary field, and \u03c1k (\u03be) is the\nworldvolume vector density (see [38]) related to \u03c1\u0302(\u03be) by\n\u03c1\u0302(\u03be) = (1/p!)d\u03be jp \u2227. . .\u2227d\u03be j1 \u03c1j1 ...jp (\u03be) = (1/p!)d\u03be jp \u2227. . .\u2227\nd\u03be j1 \u01ebj1 ...jp k \u03c1k (\u03be).\n\n\f9\nOne easily finds that the action (68) possesses all but\none of the local spacetime supersymmetries [44], Eq. (66),\n31 for \u03b1, \u03b2 = 1, . . . , 32 corresponding to D = 11. Indeed,\nperforming a supersymmetric variation \u03b4\u03b5 of (68) assuming \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) = 0, one finds\n\u03b4\u03b5 S = \u22122i\n\nZ\n\n\u03c8\u0302 \u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) \u03b5\u0302\u03b2 \u03bb\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) .\n\n(70)\n\nW1\n\nThus, one sees that \u03b4\u03b5 S = 0 for the supersymmetry parameters on W 1 that obey (cf. (20))\n\u03b5\u0302\u03b2 \u03bb\u03b2 (\u03c4 ) = 0\n\n(\u03b5\u0302\u03b2 := \u03b5\u03b2 (x\u0302(\u03c4 ))) .\n\n(71)\n\nClearly Eq. (71) possesses 31 solutions, which may be expressed through worldvolume spinors \u01eb\u0302I \u03b1 (\u03c4 ) (the worldline counterparts of the Killing spinors) orthogonal to\n\u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ), \u01eb\u0302I \u03b1 (\u03c4 )\u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) = 0, as\n\u03b5\u0302\u03b2 = \u03b5I (\u03c4 )\u01eb\u0302I \u03b2\n\n,\n\nI = 1, . . . , 31 ,\n\n(72)\n\nfor some arbitrary \u03b5I (\u03c4 ). The same is true for the tensionless p-branes described by the action (69).\nThus, the actions (68), (69) possess 31 of the 32 local spacetime supersymmetries (66) and, in the light of\nthe discussion of the previous section, can be considered as the spacetime counterparts of a superspace BPS\u2013\npreonic action (hypothetical in the standard superspace\nbut known [2, 30, 31] in flat maximally enlarged or tensorial superspaces).\nThe question that remains to be settled is the meaning of the symmetric spin\u2013tensor one\u2013form e\u03b1\u03b2 with the\nlocal supersymmetry transformation rule (66) in D = 11\nsupergravity. The contraction of e\u03b1\u03b2 with \u0393a ,\nea = e\u03b1\u03b2 \u0393a\u03b1\u03b2\n\n,\n\n(73)\n\nmay be identified with the D = 11 vielbein. Decomposing e\u03b1\u03b2 in the basis of the D = 11 Spin(1, 10) gamma\u2013\nmatrices,\ne\u03b1\u03b2 = e\u03b2\u03b1 =\n(74)\n1 a \u03b1\u03b2\n1\n1\n=\ne \u0393a \u2212\nB ab \u0393\u03b1\u03b2 +\nB a1 ...a5 \u0393\u03b1\u03b2\na1 ...a5 ,\n32\n2! 32 1 ab\n5! 32 1\none finds that e\u03b1\u03b2 also contains the antisymmetric tensor one\u2013forms B1ab (x) = dx\u03bc B\u03bcab (x) and B1a1 ...a5 (x) =\ndx\u03bc B\u03bca1 ...a5 (x). Such fields, moreover, with exactly the\nsame supersymmetry transformation rules, are involved\nin the D = 11 supergravity model by D'Auria and Fr\u00e9\n[18].\nThus the action (68) can be teated as a worldline action for a BPS preon in the background of the D'Auria\u2013\nFr\u00e9, OSp(1|32)\u2013related 'gauge' supergravity model. This\nmight be regarded as an indirect indication of the existence of BPS preonic \u03bd = 31/32 solutions in D'Auria\u2013Fr\u00e9\nD = 11 supergravity.\nThe possibility of having preonic actions in the standard CJS supergravity requires additional study.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\n\nIn this paper we have studied the r\u00f4le of the BPS preon\nnotion [1] in the analysis of supersymmetric solutions of\nD = 11 supergravity. This notion suggests the moving G\u2013frame method, which we propose as a new tool\nin the search for supersymmetric solutions of D = 11\nand D = 10 supergravity. We used this method here\nto make a step towards answering whether the standard\nCJS supergravity [5] possesses a solution preserving 31\nsupersymmetries, a solution that would correspond to a\nBPS preon state. Although this question has not been\nsettled for the CJS supergravity case, we have shown in\nour framework that preonic, \u03bd = 31/32 solutions do exist\nin a Chern\u2013Simons type D = 11 supergravity [14].\nAlthough the main search for preonic solutions concerns the 'free' bosonic CJS supergravity equations,\none should not exclude other possibilities, both inside\nand outside the CJS standard supergravity framework.\nWhen, e.g., super\u2013p\u2013brane sources are included, the Einstein equation (2), and possibly the gauge field equations\n(3) and even the Bianchi identities (4), acquire r.h.s's. In\nthis case (see Eq. (12)), a r.h.s. also appears in Eq. (14)\nand the situation would have to be reconsidered. Another\nsource of modification of the CJS supergravity equations\nmight be due to 'radiative' corrections of higher order\nin curvature. Such modified equations might also allow\nfor preonic solutions not present in the unmodified ones.\nIf it were found that only the inclusion of these higher\u2013\norder curvature terms allows for preonic BPS solutions,\nthis would indicate that BPS preons cannot be seen in\na classical low energy approximation of M-theory and,\nhence, that they are intrinsically quantum objects.\nThe special r\u00f4le of BPS preons in the algebraic classification of all the M-theory BPS states [1] allows us to\nconjecture that they are elementary (quark-like) necessary ingredients of any model providing a more complete\ndescription of M-theory. In such a framework, if the standard supergravity did not contain \u03bd = 31/32 solutions,\nneither in its 'free' form, nor in the presence of a super\u2013p\u2013\nbrane source, this might just indicate the need for a wider\nframework for an effective description of M\u2013theory. Such\nan approach could include Chern\u2013Simons supergravities\n[14] and/or the use of larger, extended superspaces (see\n[32, 37] and refs. therein), in particular with additional\ntensorial coordinates (also relevant in the description of\nmassless higher\u2013spin theories [2, 3]). In this perspective\nour observation that the BPS preonic configurations do\nsolve the bosonic equations of Chern\u2013Simons supergravity models looks interesting.\nNote added. We mention that it might be interesting\nto look at the role of vectors and higher order tensors\nthat may be constructed from the preonic spinors \u03bb\u03b1 r ,\na\nin analogy with the use of the Killing vectors KIJ\n=\na\na1 ***as\n\u01ebJ made in\n\u01ebI \u0393 \u01ebJ and higher order bilinears \u01ebI \u0393\nRefs.
