The static potential for two opposite charged exotic particles described by generalized Maxwell theory is found to have screening nature on fuzzy two-sphere instead of\nconfinement which is a special property of the system on the plane.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nVarious brane configurations have attracted much attention over the recent years and\nseveral papers have been devoted to the study of a relationship between noncommutative\ngeometry [1] and string theory [2] and the relationship between D-branes with different\ndimensions as well [3, 4]. The appearance of noncommutative geometry in string theory can\nbe understood from a different point of view. For example, a D2-brane can be constructed\nfrom multiple D0-branes by imposing a noncommutative relation on their coordinates\nin matrix theory or under the strong magnetic field the world volume coordinates of a\nD2-brane become noncommutative by considering the quantum Hall system [4] and the\nmagnetic field charge is interpreted as the number of D0-branes.\n\u2217\n\njdouari@excite.com\n\n1\n\n\fIn this work, we consider exotic particles described by generalized Maxwell theory\nin which we introduce a generalized connection in fuzzy two-sphere which has a dual\ndescription in terms of an abelian gauge field on a spherical D2-brane and is interpreted\nas a bound state of a spherical D2-brane and D0-branes. The exotic particles are known\nas excitations and quasi-particles or anyons; i.e. fermions (bosons) carrying odd (even)\nnumber of elementary magnetic flux quanta [5]. They are living in two-dimensional space\nas composite particles having arbitrary spin, and they are characterized by fractional\nstatistics which are interpolating between bosonic statistics and fermionic one [5, 6]. One\nof the field-theories describing anyons is the model, where the matter is interacting with\nthe Chern-Simons (CS) gauge field [7]. In the reference [8], Stern has introduced another\napproach to treat anyons that does not require the CS term, but introduces a generalized\nconnection with which the conserved U(1) current is coupled in a gauge invariant way [9].\nIn this model the gauge field is dynamic and the potential has the confining nature which\nmakes the model different [10].\nThis paper is devoted to treat the same system but on two-sphere. Among the main\nresults in this work is the change of the potential's nature; there is no confinement nature any more, and the disappearance of the confinement in two-sphere case for the exotic system is very interesting result. It was shown in [11] that compact Maxwell theory in (2+1)-dimensions confines permanently electric test charges and the usual twodimensional Coulomb potential is V (R) \u223c lnR. Since the electrostatic potential has the\nform V (R) \u223c R and holds for all values of the gauge coupling, the compact (2+1)dimensional Maxwell theory does not exhibit any phase transition, i.e., the confinement\nis permanent. In the present paper, the things are changed by treating the exotic system\nin high dimensions and V (R) \u223c R1 with R is the distance between two opposite charged\nexotic particles. Another important result we get is at the level of energy; D2-brane gets\nhigh energy if the radius r of the two-sphere goes to infinity and it is higher if the number\nof charges is large which makes the system very special.\nThe main results of this work: The fuzzy two-sphere is realized as one of D2-brane\ndescriptions with special properties because of the generalized Maxwell theory. Among\nthese properties we get the energy of gauge field dominates when the radius of fuzzy twosphere goes to infinity, then the energy of flat D2-brane which is a dual of fuzzy two-sphere\nbecomes high which is different from the case of quantum Hall effect (QHE) where the\nenergy of flat D2-brane goes to zero. An important remark is that our system could be\nidentified to QHE in high dimensions only if the radius r and the number of charges N go\nto zero. Also, what makes the model very different and very special is that the potential\nloses the confining nature in fuzzy two-sphere case.\n\n2\n\nGeneralized Connection and Anyons\n\nThe simplest way to realize fractional statistics characterizing anyons in three-dimensional\nspace-time is usually by adding a Chern-Simons term to the action. Recently, a novel way\nwas introduced in [8] to describe anyons without a Chern-Simons term. Thus, a generalized connection was considered in (2+1)-dimensions denoted A\u03b8\u03bc , \u03bc = 0, 1, 2. The gauge\ntheory is defined by the following Lagrangian\n1\nL\u03b8 = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd + J \u03bc A\u03b8\u03bc\n4\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fwith A\u03b8\u03bc \u2261 A\u03bc + \u03b82 \u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 F \u03bd\u03c1 and \u03b8 is real parameter in Minkowski space. The Lagrangian\nL\u03b8 describes Maxwell theory that couples to the current via the generalized connection\nrather than the usual one. This coupling is gauge invariant as long as J \u03bc is a conserved\nexternal current. In this theory, the gauge fields are dynamic and the canonical moments\nare \u03c0 \u03bc = F \u03bc0 + \u03b8\u01eb0\u03bc\u03bd J\u03bd which results in the usual primary constraint \u03c0 0 = 0 and \u03c0 i =\nF i0 + \u03b8\u01eb0ij Jj (i, j = 1, 2). Thus the magnetic field is B = \u01ebij \u2202 i Aj and the electric field is\nE i = \u03c0 i \u2212 \u03b8\u01ebij Jj .\nNow, accordingly to (1), the equations of motion for A\u03bc give\n\u2202 \u03bd \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc = J\u03bc + \u03b8\u01eb\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 \u2202 \u03bd J \u03c1 .\n\n(2)\n\nThen, we consider the simplest case of a static pointlike particle located at the origin\nwhich is described by J 0 = e\u03b4 (2) (x). By solving (2) for the gauge field one finds\nA0 =\n\nlnr\n,\n2\u03c0\n\nA1 =\n\n\u03b8x2\n,\n2\u03c0r 2\n\nA2 =\n\n\u03b8x1\n,\n2\u03c0r 2\n\nwith r 2 = x21 + x22 . This background describes one unit of an electrically charged particle\nand an infinitely thin magnetic flux with total flux \u03b8 both located at the origin and the\nshift in the statistics of the particle is fixed by the Aharonov-Bohm effect to be\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03b8.\n\n(3)\n\nWe note that in the case of Chern-Simons theory, the phase is two times \u03b8 and this is\ndue to the fact that the charged particle is winding around a magnetic flux while in the\npresent theory we also have the contribution of a flux tube winding around the charged\nparticle. Another reason is that with A\u03b8\u03bc construction a long range electric field is also\ngenerated which couples to the current and gives exactly the same phase.\nFor a static charged particle located at the origin and J i = 0, the static electromagnetic\nfields are\nB(x) = e\u03b8\u03b4 (2) (x)\n(4)\ne xi\nEi (x) = \u2212 2\u03c0\nr2\n\nand the total magnetic flux attached to N charged particles is\n\u03a6=\n\nZ\n\nV\n\nd2 xB(x) = e\u03b8N.\n\n(5)\n\nWe note that the both LCS (the lagrangian in Chern-Simons theory) and L\u03b8 lead to\nfractional statistics by the same mechanism of attaching a magnetic flux to the charged\nparticles but the physics they describe is quite different. We remark, for example, that\nin this theory the interaction potential is an object of considerable interest [10]. The\npotential has confining nature; i. e., it grows to infinity when the natural separation\nof the physical degrees of freedom grow, but in the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, the\nChern-Simons term turns the electric and magnetic fields massive leading to a screening\npotential between static charges.\n\n3\n\nAnyons and Fuzzy Two-Sphere\n\nNow, let us consider exotic particle moving on a two-sphere instead of a plane in the\n(2)\nbackground of a monopole put at the origin. First, the two-sphere is S 2 \u223c CP 1 = SU\nU (1)\nand the representations of SU(2) are given by the standard angular momentum theory.\n3\n\n\fThe coordinates of fuzzy two-sphere are given by the SU(2) algebra\n[Xi , Xj ] = i\u03b1\u01ebijk Xk , Xi = \u03b1Li ,\n\n(6)\n\nLi is the total angular momentum with the representation to be the spin l and \u03b1 is a\ndimensionful constant. We note that around the north pole of S 2 labeled by L3 = l, the\nfuzzy two-sphere algebra becomes a noncommutative plane if l \u2192 \u221e,\n[Xi , Xj ] = i\u03b12 l\u01ebij I,\n\n(7)\n\nwith I is the identity.\n\n3.1\n\nConnection\n\nTo construct the connection which goes to the generalized connection given above\nwhen the radius of fuzzy two-sphere goes to infinity we use the first Hopf map as known\nin the literature which is a map from S 3 to S 2 and naturally introduces a U(1) bundle\non S 2 . Then, the two-sphere can be parameterized by two complex coordinates u\u03b1 such\nthat u\u22c6\u03b1 u\u03b1 = 1 with u\u03b1 \u223c ei\u03b8 u\u03b1 . A spatial coordinate xi on S 2 with radius r is written in\nterms of u\u03b1 's as\nxi = ru\u2020 \u03c3i u\n(8)\nwith \u03c3 are Pauli matrices. The vector potential on S 2 is\nAi dxi = \u2212i\u03b3u\u22c6\u03b1 du\u03b1 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwith \u03b3 is integer due to the Dirac quantization rule and u\u22c6\u03b1 is the complex conjugate of u\u03b1 .\nThus, the Hopf spinor satisfying (8) is given by\nu=\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010 r+x\n\u0011\n1\nu1 \u0011\n3\nei\u03c7 ,\n=q\nx\n+\nix\nu2\n1\n2\n2r(r + x3 )\n\n(10)\n\nei\u03c7 is a U(1) phase. The connection is defined as\nh\u0304\nh\u0304\nAi dxi = \u2212i u\u22c6\u03b1 du\u03b1 =\n\u01ebij3 xj dxi .\ne\n2er(r + x3 )\n\n(11)\n\nBy leading with the motion of an exotic particle (charged particle-magnetic flux comh\u0304\n\u03b8\nposite) on two-sphere, the monopole charge is 2e\n= 4\u03c0\nwhich is identified with the connection in two dimensional space for r \u2192 \u221e discussed in section 2. By generalizing the\n\u03b8\n= h\u0304S\nand\nspinor to (2S + 1)-components spinor u(S) , the monopole charge becomes 4\u03c0\ne\n\u2020\n1\n2\nxi = S ru(S) \u03c3(S)i u(S) , xi xi = r , where \u03c3(S)i is the spin S representation of SU(2).\nNow, for simplicity we consider a static particle at x\u2032 . The magnetic and electric fields\nare given in (4) and the charge-magnetic dipole is defined by the current\nJ0 = e\u03b4 (3) (x \u2212 x\u2032 ) Ji = \u03c6e \u01ebim \u2202m J0 ,\n\u03c6 is the dipole's moment.\n4\n\n(12)\n\n\f3.2\n\nGeneralized Maxwell Theory\nThe Hamiltonian of this system is written as follows\nH=\n\n1\nMi Mi +\n2mr 2\n\nZ\n\n1\n1\n\u03b8\nd3 x(\u2212 Fi0 F i0 + Fij F ij \u2212 \u01ebij J 0 F ij )\n2\n4\n2\n\n(13)\n\nsuch that for a static point like particle Ji = 0 and the primary constraint is\n\u03c00 = 0\nwhich leads to the secondary constraint\n\u2202i \u03c0 i \u2212 J 0 = 0\nwith \u03c0 \u03bc is the canonical momentum of gauge field A\u03bc . Mi is the orbital angular momentum\nof the charged particle\nMi = \u01ebijk xj (\u2212ih\u0304\u2202k + eA\u03b8k )\n(14)\n= \u01ebijk xj (\u2212ih\u0304\u2202k + eAk +\n\ne\u03b8\n\u01eb F nm\n2 knm\n\n+\n\ne\u03b8\n\u01eb F n0 )\n2 kn0\n\nwhere i, j, k, n, m = 1, 2, 3 and A\u03b8k is the generalized connection. The strength field F \u03bc\u03bd is\n\u03b8\n\u01ebnml rx3l\nF nm = \u2212 4\u03c0\n\nF\n\nn0\n\n=\n\n\u03b8\n\u01eb (\u1e8b\n4\u03c0r(r+x3 ) nl3 l\n\n\u2212\n\n2r+x3\n\u1e59xl r(r+x\n),\n3)\n\n(15)\n\nwe note that \u01ebkn0 F n0 = 0 since \u01ebnl3 \u01ebkn0 = 0 because l 6= 0. Then\nMi = \u01ebijk xj (\u2212ih\u0304\u2202k + eAk \u2212\n\ne\u03b82 xk\n).\n4\u03c0 r 3\n\n(16)\n\nThus the Hamiltonian (13) of this system is reduced to\n1\n1\nH=\nMi Mi +\n2\n2mr\n2\n\nZ\n\nd3 x(Ei2 + B 2 ),\n\n(17)\n\nwith \u01eboij J 0 F ij = \u01eboij J 0 \u2212\u03b8\n\u01ebijk xr3k = 2 \u2212\u03b8\n\u03b4 J 0 xr3k = 0 in (13) since k = 1, 2, 3 6= 0. Ac4\u03c0\n4\u03c0 0k\ncordingly to (4,5), we calculate the second term of H in three-dimensional space and the\nHamiltonian is\ne2 r\nH = H0 + e2 \u03b82 N +\n,\n(18)\n3\u03c0\nwith\n1\nMi Mi .\n(19)\nH0 =\n2mr 2\nThe remark we get from this subsection is that the Hamiltonian is different from the one\ndescribing QHE and they are identified (H \u223c H0 ) only if N, r \u2212\u2192 0.\n\n5\n\n\f3.3\n\nRealization of Fuzzy Two-Sphere\n\nFirst, we remark that the orbital angular momentum of the particle Mi given by (14)\nsatisfy the following deformed commutation relations\n[Mi , Mj ] = ih\u0304\u01ebijk (Mk +\n\ne\u03b8\nxk ).\n2\u03c0r\n\n(20)\n\nThis means that the total angular momentum generalizing the SU(2) algebra should be\ndefined as\ne\u03b8\nLi = Mi \u2212\nxi\n(21)\n2\u03c0r\nand we get\n[Li , Lj ] = ih\u0304\u01ebijk Lk\n[Li , Mj ] = ih\u0304\u01ebijk Mk\n\n(22)\n\n[Li , xj ] = ih\u0304\u01ebijk xk .\nConsequently, by simple calculation we find that\n[Li , H] = 0,\nthen SU(2) symmetry is generated by Li . We also see that\ne\u03b8 2\n)\nMi Mi = Li Li \u2212 ( 2\u03c0\n\n(23)\n\n= h\u03042 (l(l + 1) \u2212 4S 2 ),\nwith l is the eigenvalue of L3 . In what follows we suggest that l = n+2S with n = 0, 1, 2....\nThe noncommutative Geometry known as fuzzy two-sphere is described by the guiding\ncenter coordinates since the exotic particle obeys the cyclotron motion as well-known in\nthe planar system. These coordinates are defined as\nXi =\n\n2\u03c0r\nLi ,\ne\u03b8\n\n(24)\n\nthen they are related to the commutative coordinates by\nXi =\n\n2\u03c0r\nMi \u2212 xi .\ne\u03b8\n\n(25)\n\nThey satisfy the following commutative relations\n[Xi , Xj ] = ih\u0304\u01ebijk\n\n2\u03c0r\nXk ,\ne\u03b8\n\n(26)\n\nand the fuzzy two-sphere is satisfied for the motion of exotic particle on two-sphere. Its\nradius is given by the quadratic Casimir of SU(2)\nr 2 = h\u03042 (\n\n2\u03c0r 2\n) 2S(2S + 1).\ne\u03b8\n6\n\n(27)\n\n\fAccording to (23,24), we get the radius of the cyclotron motion in the n-th level\nrnc =\n\n2\u03c0r q\nh\u0304 2S(2n + 1) + n(n + 1).\ne\u03b8\n\n(28)\n\nFor the lowest level we get\n\nr\n(29)\nr0c = \u221a ,\n2S\nwhich is identified with the one obtained in the lowest Landau Level discussed in [4]. Also\nwe remark that r0c is much smaller that r in the strong magnetic field limit, and xi are\nidentified with Xi .\n\n3.4\n\nEnergy in Fuzzy Two-Sphere Case\nOwing to (23), the energy eigenvalue of H (18) is\n\nh\u03042\ne2 r\n2 2\n(2S(2n\n+\n1)\n+\nn(n\n+\n1))\n+\ne\n\u03b8\nN\n+\n.\n(30)\n2mr 2\n3\u03c0\nThen we notice that this model could be identified with the one treated in the references\n[4] only in the following case: If both of the radius of fuzzy two-sphere and the number of\ncharges N are too small; i.e. r, N \u2212\u2192 0. Also, we note that n in (30) indicates the level\nindex which could be identified with the Landau level index in the Chern-Simons theory\nonly for small r and N. The variance energy between the lowest level n = 0 and the first\nlevel is\nh\u03042 (2S + 1)\n\u2206E =\n.\nmr 2\nAs remark, the lowest level is also realized in our system which is identified to the\nLowest Landau level phenomena if the number of charges is too small and r \u2212\u2192 0 with\nS\n\u226b 1 and the energy induced by the dynamic gauge field is ignored. Otherwise, if the\nmr\nabove case is not satisfied; i.e. r \u226b 1 or N \u226b 1, the model is now totally different. Thus\nthe variance energy of the system is\nEn =\n\n\u2206E = 0,\nand the energy is dominated by the one of the two last terms of (28) or both. Then the\nenergy is\ne2 r\nEn = e2 \u03b82 N +\n, \u2200n.\n(31)\n3\u03c0\nWe notice here that the variance energy of the system will depend only on the variance\nof the number of particles or the radius.\nConsequently, dealing with the case of exotic particles system in which we introduce a\ngeneralized connection put at the origin of two-sphere we get a noncommutative geometry.\nThe energy obtained in this model is very special and too different from the one obtained\nin QHE case since the gauge field in this system is dynamic. We notice that the energy\nof gauge field dominates when the radius of fuzzy two-sphere goes to infinity; i.e. the flat\nD2-brane which is a dual of fuzzy two-sphere has high energy. We remark that this result\nis definitely different from the one could be obtained in the case of QHE. In this latter\ncase if r \u2212\u2192 \u221e the fuzzy two-sphere goes to flat D2-brane having low energy which goes\nto zero.\n7\n\n\f3.5\n\nPotential\n\nWe complete this section by giving another interesting remark. As known, the potential has confining nature in two-dimensional space when the generalized connection\nis introduced instead of adding CS-term; i. e., the potential grows to infinity when the\nnatural separation of the physical degrees of freedom grows.\nAfter giving the energy we may now proceed to discuss the interaction energy between\npointlike sources in the model under consideration. This can be done by computing the\nexpectation value of the energy operator H in a physical state | \u03a9i by following the\nmechanism used in [12]. We consider the stringy gauge-invariant | \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03a8(r)i state,\n\u2212ie\n\u2032\n\n| \u03a9i \u2261| \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03a8(y )i =| \u03c8\u0304(y)e\n\nRy\u2032\n\ndz i Ai (z)\n\ny\n\n\u03c8(y \u2032) | 0i,\n\n(32)\n\nwhere | 0i is the physical vacuum state and the integral is to be over the linear spacelike\npath starting at y and ending at y \u2032 , on a fixed time slice. Note that the strings between\nexotic particles have been introduced to have a gauge-invariant state | \u03a9i, in other terms,\nthis means that the elementary particles (bosons or fermions) are now dressed by a cloud\nof gauge fields.\nFrom the foregoing Hamiltonian discussion, we first note that\n\u03c0i | \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03a8(y \u2032)i = \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03a8(y \u2032)\u03c0i | 0i + e\n\nZy\n\n\u2032\n\ny\n\ndzi \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 z) | \u03a8\u0304(y)\u03a8(y \u2032)i.\n\n(33)\n\nOwing to (17,31) and the fact that we consider a static pointlike particle; so \u03c0i = F0i = Ei ,\nwe get the expectation value of the Hamiltonian as\ne2\nh\u03a9 | H | \u03a9i = h0 | H | 0i +\n2\n\ny\u2032\n\nZ\n\n3\n\n\u0010Z\n\ndx\n\ny\n\n\u00112\n\ndzi \u03b4 3 (x \u2212 z) ,\n\n(34)\n\nwith x and z are three-dimensional vectors. Remembering that the integrals over zi are\nzero except on the contour of integrations.\nThe last term of (34) is nothing but the Coulomb interaction plus an infinite selfenergy term. In order to carry out this calculation we write the path as z = y + \u03b1(y \u2212 y \u2032)\nwhere \u03b1 is the parameter describing the contour. By using the spherical coordinates the\nintegral under square becomes\nZy\ny\n\n\u2032\n\ny \u2212 y\u2032\ndzi \u03b4 (x \u2212 z) =\n|y \u2212 y \u2032|2\n3\n\nZ1\n0\n\nX\n1\n\u2217\nd\u03b1 \u03b4(|y \u2212 x|, \u03b1|y \u2032 \u2212 y|)\nYlm\n(\u03b8\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032)Ylm (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n\u03b1\nl,m\n\n(35)\n\nUsing the usual properties for the spherical harmonics and after subtracting the self-energy\nterm, we obtain the potential as\nV =\u2212\n\ne2\n1\n\u2032\n4\u03c0 |y \u2212 y|\n\n(36)\n\nThis result lets us to draw attention to the fact that with fuzzy two-sphere the generalized Maxwell theory doesn't have confining nature any more which was a special\nproperty for anyons described by generalized Maxwell theory in two-dimensional space.\nThus the problem of confinement could be solved by considering the two-sphere in stead\nof two-dimensions.\n8\n\n\f4\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have used the generalized Maxwell theory on two-sphere instead of\ntwo-dimensional space. This leaded to get some results totally different from those gotten\nin the case of QHE in high dimensions [4]. By considering the exotic particles described by\ngeneralized Maxwell theory, the energy produced by the gauge field is involved in the energy of the system (18) depending on the number of charges and the radius of the sphere.\nWe remark that the energy of gauge field dominates when the radius of two-sphere goes\nto infinity; i. e. the energy of flat D2-brane is generated by the gauge field leading to high\nenergy. We also notice that the energy becomes more higher if the number of charges is\nlarge. Another important remark is that with fuzzy two-sphere the static potential for two\nopposite charged exotic particles loses automatically its confining nature without adding\nthe CS-term; i. e. by plunging the generalized Maxwell theory in high dimensions the\npotential has screening nature.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to thank Robert De Mello Koch for interesting discussions and his\nhospitality at WITS university where a part of this work was done.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
