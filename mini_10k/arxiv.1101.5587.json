Pati [25] where we study the question of when certain toric contact structures on S 3 -bundles\nover S 2 belong to equivalent contact structures. As in the talk, in this paper we concentrate on\na particularly interesting special class of toric contact structures on S 2 \u00d7S 3 studied by physicists\nin [36, 51, 52], and denoted by Y p,q where p, q are relatively prime integers satisfying 0 < q < p.\nThese structures have become of much interest in the study of the AdS/CFT conjecture [37, 38]\nin M-theory since they admit Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics. The AdS/CFT correspondence relates\nstring theory on the product of anti-deSitter space with a compact Einstein space to quantum field theory on the conformal boundary, thus giving a kind of holographic principle. As\nSasaki\u2013Einstein metrics admit Killing spinors [34, 35], the string theories or M-theory are supersymmetric. The relation to contact structures is that Sasakian metrics are a special class of\ncontact metric structures, and roughly Sasakian geometry is to contact geometry what K\u00e4hlerian\ngeometry is to symplectic geometry. We refer to the recent book [22] for a thorough treatment\nof Sasakian geometry.\nThe connection between completely integrable Hamiltonian systems and toric geometry in\nthe symplectic setting is best described by the famous Arnold\u2013Liouville theorem1 which in its\nmodern formulation (due to Arnold [3]) roughly states the following: let (M 2n , \u03c9) be a symplectic\nmanifold of dimension 2n with a Hamiltonian h, and assume that there are n first integrals\n\u22c6\nThis paper is a contribution to the Special Issue \"Symmetry, Separation, Super-integrability and Special\nFunctions (S4 )\". The full collection is available at http://www.emis.de/journals/SIGMA/S4.html\n1\nA very nice treatment is given by Audin [6].\n\n\f2\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nf = (h = f1 , . . . , fn ) in involution that are functionally independent on a dense open subset\nof M . Such a structure is called a completely integrable Hamiltonian system. Let a be a regular\nvalue of the moment map f : M \u2212\u2212\u2192Rn , and assume that the fiber fa = f \u22121 (a) is compact\nand connected, then fa is a torus T n , and moreover, there is a neighborhood of fa that is\ndiffeomorphic to T n \u00d7 D n where D n is an n-dimensional disk, and the flow of h is linear in the\nstandard coordinates on T n and independent of the coordinates of D n . The coordinates of T n\nare called angle coordinates and those of D n action coordinates. Thus, locally such a manifold\nlooks like a toric symplectic manifold, that is, a symplectic manifold with a locally free local\ntorus action. However, there is an obstruction to having a global torus action [31, 14], namely\nthe monodromy of a certain period lattice. The case where one does have a global Hamiltonian\nT n -action on a compact symplectic manifold (M 2n , \u03c9) is both beautiful and well-understood.\nFirst, there is the Atiyah\u2013Guillemin\u2013Sternberg theorem [5, 40] which says that the image of\nthe moment map is a convex polytope in Rn , and then a theorem of Delzant [30] which states\nthat the polytope characterizes the toric symplectic structure up to equivariant Hamiltonian\nsymplectomorphism.\nTurning to the contact case, the development has been more recent. In fact, developing a theory of completely integrable systems in contact geometry was listed as problem #1995-12 in [4].\nArnold seemed to have been unaware of the seminal work of Banyaga and Molino [9, 10, 8] who\ndevelop the case of a local action of an (n + 1)-dimensional torus on an oriented compact contact manifold giving the contact version of the Arnold\u2013Liouville theorem under some additional\nassumptions. But even a bit earlier the foliation approach to contact complete integrability\nwas given [49, 56]. Much more recently a description in terms of a flag of foliations was given\nin [44]. The approach presented here is more along the classical lines of using first integrals of\ncommuting functions. As we shall see there are some subtle differences with the symplectic case\nwhich manifest themselves differently depending on the presentation. As mentioned above our\nmain focus will be on completely integrable contact systems on a (2n + 1)-dimensional compact\ncontact manifold that arise from the global action of an (n + 1)-dimensional torus.\nAs in the symplectic case the monodromy of an appropriate period lattice is the obstruction\nto having a global T n+1 -action. In [21] the subclass of contact manifolds with a T n+1 -action\nwhose Reeb vector field lies in the Lie algebra of the torus was studied. It was shown that\nall such toric contact manifolds (of Reeb type) are determined by a certain polytope lying in\na hyperplane (the characteristic hyperplane) in the dual of the Lie algebra of the torus, and\nthey can all be obtained from contact reduction of an odd dimensional sphere with its standard\ncontact structure. Furthermore, all toric contact structures of Reeb type admit a compatible\nSasakian metric. A complete classification of all compact toric contact manifolds up to T n+1 equivariance was then given by Lerman [46]. We are interested in the contact equivalence\nproblem in the toric setting. We can ask the following question. Given any two inequivalent\ntoric contact Hamiltonian structures on a smooth manifold M , when are they equivalent as\ncontact manifolds? Although there are several new results in this paper, its main purpose is to\ngive a proof of the following theorem which is a particular case of the more general results to\nappear in [25].\nTheorem 1. Let p, q be relatively prime integers satisfying 0 < q < p. The toric contact\n\u2032 \u2032\nstructures Y p,q and Y p ,q on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 belong to equivalent contact structures if and only if\np\u2032 = p, and for each fixed integer p > 1 there are exactly \u03c6(p) toric contact structures Y p,q on\nS 2 \u00d7 S 3 that are equivalent as contact structures. Moreover, the contactomorphism group of Y p,q\nhas at least \u03c6(p) conjugacy classes of maximal tori of dimension three.\nHere \u03c6(p) denotes the Euler phi function, that is the number of positive integers that are less\nthan p and relatively prime to p.\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n2\n\n3\n\nA brief review of contact geometry\n\nIn this section we give a very brief review of contact geometry referring to the books [50, 12, 22,\n11] for details.\n\n2.1\n\nContact manifolds\n\nRecall that a contact structure on a connected oriented manifold M is an equivalence class of\n1-forms \u03b7 satisfying \u03b7 \u2227 (d\u03b7)n 6= 0 everywhere on M where two 1-forms \u03b7, \u03b7 \u2032 are equivalent if\nthere exists a nowhere vanishing function f such that \u03b7 \u2032 = f \u03b7. We shall also assume that our\ncontact structure has an orientation, or equivalently, the function f is everywhere positive. More\nconveniently the contact structure can be thought of as the oriented 2n-plane bundle defined\nby D = ker \u03b7. A manifold M with a contact structure D is called a contact manifold which is\nnecessarily odd dimensional, and is denoted by (M, D). Choosing a contact form \u03b7 gives D the\nstructure of a symplectic vector bundle with 2-form d\u03b7. Choosing another contact form \u03b7 \u2032 = f \u03b7\nwe see that\nd\u03b7 \u2032 |D\u00d7D = f d\u03b7|D\u00d7D ,\n\n(1)\n\nso D has a natural conformal symplectic structure.\nFor every choice of contact 1-form \u03b7 there exists a unique vector field R\u03b7 , called the Reeb\nvector field, that satisfies \u03b7(R\u03b7 ) = 1 and R\u03b7 d\u03b7 = 0. The dynamics of the Reeb field R\u03b7 can\nchange drastically as we change \u03b7. The one dimensional foliation FR\u03b7 on M generated by R\u03b7 is\noften called the characteristic foliation. We say that the foliation FR\u03b7 is quasi-regular if there\nis a positive integer k such that each point has a foliated coordinate chart (U, x) such that each\nleaf of FR\u03b7 passes through U at most k times. If k = 1 then the foliation is called regular. We\nalso say that the corresponding contact 1-form \u03b7 is quasi-regular (regular), and more generally\nthat a contact structure D is quasi-regular (regular) if it has a quasi-regular (regular) contact\n1-form. A contact 1-form (or characteristic foliation) that is not quasi-regular is called irregular.\nWhen M is compact a regular contact form \u03b7 is a connection 1-form in a principle S 1 bundle\n\u03c0 : M \u2212\u2212\u2192Z over a symplectic base manifold Z whose symplectic form \u03c9 satisfies \u03c0 \u2217 \u03c9 = d\u03b7.\nIn the quasi-regular case \u03c0 : M \u2212\u2212\u2192Z is an S 1 orbibundle over the symplectic orbifold Z. The\nformer is known as the Boothby\u2013Wang construction [13] and the latter the orbifold Boothby\u2013\nWang construction [20]. S 1 orbibundles play an important role in the proof of Theorem 1.\n\n2.2\n\nCompatible metrics and Sasakian structures\n\nLet (M, D) be a contact manifold and fix a contact form \u03b7. Choose an almost complex structure J in the symplectic vector bundle (D, d\u03b7) and extend it to a section \u03a6 of the endomorphism\nbundle of T M by demanding that it annihilates the Reeb vector field, that is, \u03a6R\u03b7 = 0. We say\nthat the almost complex structure J is compatible with D if for any sections X, Y of D we have\nd\u03b7(JX, JY ) = d\u03b7(X, Y ),\n\nd\u03b7(JX, Y ) > 0.\n\nNote that gD (X, Y ) = d\u03b7(JX, Y ) defines an Hermitian metric on the vector bundle D. Moreover,\nwe can extend this to a Riemannian metric on M by defining\ng = d\u03b7 \u25e6 (\u03a6 \u2297 1l) + \u03b7 \u2297 \u03b7.\nNote that the contact metric g satisfies the compatibility condition\ng(\u03a6X, \u03a6Y ) = g(X, Y ) \u2212 \u03b7(X)\u03b7(Y ),\n\n\f4\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nwhere X, Y are vector fields on M . Then the quadruple S = (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is called a contact\nmetric structure on M . Note also that the pair (D, J) defines a strictly pseudoconvex almost CR\nstructure on M . The contact metric structure (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is said to be K-contact if the Reeb\nvector field R\u03b7 is a Killing vector field for the metric g, that is, if \u00a3R\u03b7 g = 0. This is equivalent\nto the condition \u00a3R\u03b7 \u03a6 = 0. If in addition the almost CR structure (D, J) is integrable, that is\na CR structure, then (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is a Sasakian structure. For a detailed treatment, including\nmany examples, of Sasakian structures we refer to [22].\nIf M is compact and S = (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is a Sasakian structure (actually K-contact is enough)\non M , then if necessary by perturbing the Reeb vector field we can take R\u03b7 to generate an\nS 1 -action which leaves invariant the Sasakian structure. So the Sasakian automorphism group\nAut(S) which is a compact Lie group has dimension at least one. If its maximal torus T k has\ndimension k greater than one, then there is a cone t+\nk of Reeb vector fields, the Sasaki cone, lying\nin the Lie algebra tk of T k such that \u03b7(\u03be) > 0 everywhere for all \u03be \u2208 t+\nk . Note that the vector\n\u03b7\n\u2032\nfield \u03be is the Reeb vector field for the contact form \u03b7 = \u03b7(\u03be) , and the induced contact metric\nstructure S \u2032 = (\u03be, \u03b7 \u2032 , \u03a6\u2032 , g \u2032 ) is Sasakian. The conical nature of tk is exhibited by the transverse\nhomothety (cf. [22]) which takes a Sasakian structure S = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) to the Sasakian structure\n\u0001\n\u0001\nSa = a\u22121 \u03be, a\u03b7, \u03a6, ag + a2 \u2212 a \u03b7 \u2297 \u03b7\nfor any a \u2208 R+ .\n\n2.3\n\nThe symplectization\n\nContact geometry can be understood in terms of symplectic geometry through its symplectization. Given a contact structure D on M we recall the symplectic cone C(M ) = M \u00d7 R+ with\nits natural symplectic structure \u03a9 = d(r 2 \u03b7) where r is a coordinate on R+ . Note that \u03a9 only\ndepends on the contact structure D and not on the choice of contact form \u03b7. For if \u03b7 \u2032 = e2f \u03b7 is another choice of contact form, we can change coordinates r \u2032 = e\u2212f r to give d(r \u20322 \u03b7 \u2032 ) = d(r 2 \u03b7) = \u03a9.\nThe symplectic cone (C(M ), \u03a9) is called the symplectization or the symplectification of (M, D).\n\u2202\nRecall the Liouville vector field \u03a8 = r \u2202r\non the cone C(M ) and notice that it is invariant under\n\u2202\n= r \u2032 \u2202r\u2202 \u2032 . We have chosen the dependence of \u03a9\nthe above change of coordinates, i.e., \u03a8 = r \u2202r\non the radial coordinate to be homogeneous of degree 2 with respect to \u03a8, since we want compatibility with cone metrics and these are homogeneous of degree 2. In fact, a contact metric\nstructure (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) on M gives rise to an almost K\u00e4hler structure (\u03a9, \u1e21 = dr 2 + r 2 g) on C(M )\nwhich is K\u00e4hler if and only if (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is Sasakian.\nAn alternative approach to the symplectization is to consider the cotangent bundle T \u2217 M with\nits canonical (tautological) 1-form defined as follows. It is the unique 1-form \u03b8 on T \u2217 M such\nthat for every 1-form \u03b1 : M \u2212\u2212\u2192T \u2217 M\n\u03b1\u2217 \u03b8 = \u03b1. In local coordinates (xi , pi ) on T \u2217 M\nP we have\ni\nthe canonical 1-form is given by \u03b8 = i pi dx . This gives T \u2217 M a canonical symplectic structure\ndefined by d\u03b8. Let D o be the annihilator of D in T \u2217 M which is a real line bundle on M , and\no \u222a Do ,\na choice of contact 1-form \u03b7 trivializes D o \u2248 M \u00d7 R. Then D o \\ {0} splits as D o \\ {0} \u2248 D+\n\u2212\no\nwhere the sections of D+ are of the form f \u03b7 with f > 0 everywhere on M . Thus, we have the\no which is also identified with the principal R+ bundle\nidentification C(M ) = M \u00d7 R+ \u2248 D+\no\nassociated to the line bundle D . From a more intrinsic viewpoint the symplectization is the\no . A choice of oriented contact form \u03b7 gives a global\ntotal space of the principal R+ -bundle D+\no . Now \u03b7\u0303 = r 2 \u03b7 is a 1-form on C(M ), so \u03b7\u0303 \u2217 \u03b8 = \u03b7\u0303.\no\nsection of D+ , and hence a trivialization of D+\nThus, the symplectic form \u03a9 on C(M ) satisfies \u03a9 = d\u03b7\u0303 = \u03b7\u0303 \u2217 d\u03b8.\n\n2.4\n\nThe group of contactomorphisms\n\nWe are interested in the subgroup Con(M, D) of the group Diff(M ) of all diffeomorphisms of M\nthat leave the contact structure D invariant. Explicitly, this contactomorphism group is defined\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n5\n\nby\nCon(M, D) = {\u03c6 \u2208 Diff(M ) | \u03c6\u2217 D \u2282 D}.\nWe are actually interested in the subgroup Con(M, D)+ of contactomorphisms that preserve the\norientation of D. Alternatively, if we choose a contact form \u03b7 representing D these groups can\nbe characterized as\nCon(M, D) = {\u03c6 \u2208 Diff(M ) | \u03c6\u2217 \u03b7 = f \u03b7, f (x) 6= 0 for all x \u2208 M },\nCon(M, D)+ = {\u03c6 \u2208 Diff(M ) | \u03c6\u2217 \u03b7 = f \u03b7, f (x) > 0 for all x \u2208 M }.\nWe are also mainly concerned with the case that the manifold M is compact. In this\ncase Diff(M ) and Con(M, D) can be given the compact-open C \u221e topology2 in which case\nCon(M, D) becomes a regular Fr\u00e9chet Lie group [55, 7] locally modelled on the Fr\u00e9chet vector\nspace con(M, D) of infinitesimal contact transformations, that is the Lie algebra of Con(M, D)\ndefined by\ncon(M, D) = {X \u2208 X(M ) | if Y is a C \u221e section of D, so is [X, Y ]},\nwhere X(M ) denotes the vector space of all C \u221e vector fields on M . It is easy to see that this\nis equivalent to the condition\n\u00a3X \u03b7 = aX \u03b7\n\n(2)\n\nfor any contact form \u03b7 representing D and some aX \u2208 C \u221e (M ). We are also interested in the\nsubgroup Con(M, \u03b7) consisting of all \u03c6 \u2208 Con(M, D) such that \u03c6\u2217 \u03b7 = \u03b7. Its Lie algebra is\ncon(M, \u03b7) = {X \u2208 con(M, D) | \u00a3X \u03b7 = 0}.\nSimilarly, on a symplectic manifold (N, \u03c9) we have the group Sym(N, \u03c9) of symplectomorphisms defined by\nSym(N, \u03c9) = {\u03c6 \u2208 Diff(N ) | \u03c6\u2217 \u03c9 = \u03c9}.\nWhen N is compact this group is also a regular Fr\u00e9chet Lie group locally modelled on its Lie\nalgebra\nsym(N, \u03c9) = {X \u2208 X(M ) | \u00a3X \u03c9 = 0}.\nHowever, we are interested in the symplectic cone (C(M ), \u03a9) which is non-compact. Fortunately,\nthe subgroup of Sym(C(M ), \u03a9) that is important for our purposes behaves as if C(M ) were\ncompact. Let D = D(C(M )) denote the 1-parameter group of dilatations generated by the\nLiouville vector field \u03a8, and let Sym(C(M ), \u03a9)D denote the subgroup consisting of all elements of Sym(C(M ), \u03a9) that commute with D. Then one easily sees [50] that there is an\nisomorphism of groups Sym(C(M ), \u03a9)D \u2248 Con(M, D). On the infinitesimal level we also have\ncon(M, D) \u2248 sym(C(M ), \u03a9)D where sym(C(M ), \u03a9)D denotes the Lie subalgebra of all elements\nof sym(C(M ), \u03a9) that commute with \u03a8. This isomorphism is given explicitly by\nX 7\u2192 X \u2212\n\naX\n\u03a8.\n2\n\nSince aX is defined by equation (2) this isomorphism depends on the choice of contact form \u03b7.\n2\n\nGenerally, in the non-compact case, this topology does not control the behavior at infinity, and a much larger\ntopology should be used.\n\n\f6\n\n2.5\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nLegendrian and Lagrangian submanifolds\n\nRecall that a subspace E of a symplectic vector space (V, \u03c9) is isotropic or (co-isotropic) if E \u2282\nE \u22a5 or (E \u22a5 \u2282 E), respectively, where E \u22a5 denotes the symplectic orthogonal to E. A Lagrangian\nsubspace is a maximal isotropic subspace or equivalently one which is both isotropic and coisotropic, i.e. E = E \u22a5 . A submanifold f : P \u2212\u2212\u2192N of a symplectic manifold (N 2n , \u03c9) whose\ntangent space at each point p \u2208 P is a Lagrangian subspace of (f \u2217 T N )p with respect to f \u2217 \u03c9\nis called a Lagrangian submanifold, and has dimension n. Locally all symplectic manifolds look\nthe same, andPso do all Lagrangian submanifolds. In a local Darboux coodinate chart (pi , q i )\nwe have \u03c9 = i dpi \u2227 dq i , and the Lagrangian submanifolds are the leaves of a foliation, called\nthe Lagrangian foliation, generated by the vector fields {\u2202pi }ni=1 . These vector fields form an\nn-dimensional Abelian subalgebra of sym(N, \u03c9).\nNow consider the case of a contact manifold (M 2n+1 , D) with its natural conformal symplectic\nstructure described by equation (1). Then the isotropic and co-isotropic subspaces of Dp at\na point p \u2208 M are independent of the choice of \u03b7, and the maximal isotropic (Lagrangian)\nsubspaces have dimension n. An integral submanifold of D whose tangent spaces are Lagrangian\nsubspaces of D is called a Legendrian submanifold. As in the symplectic case locally all contact\nmanifolds are the same, andPany contact 1-form \u03b7 can be written in a Darboux coordinate\nchart (z, pi , q i ) as \u03b7 = dz \u2212 i pi dq i . Again the vector fields {\u2202pi }ni=1 give a foliation, called\na Legendrian foliation whose leaves are Legendrian submanifolds; however, these vector fields\nare not infinitesimal contact transformation, since\n\u0001\n\u03b7 \u2227 \u00a3\u2202pi \u03b7 = \u03b7 \u2227 \u2202pi d\u03b7 + d(\u03b7(\u2202pi ) = \u2212\u03b7 \u2227 dq i 6= 0.\n\nNevertheless, one easily finds infinitesimal contact transformations whose projections onto D\nare \u2202pi , namely the vector fields \u2202pi + q i \u2202z . These generate an n-dimensional Abelian subalgebra\nof con(M, \u03b7). Note that the Reeb vector field of \u03b7 is \u2202z , and that the vector fields {\u2202pi +\nq i \u2202z , \u2202z }ni=1 span an (n + 1)-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra of con(M, \u03b7), and describes the\n'co-Legendrian foliation' of [44]. Actually, the local geometry of a contact structure is described\nby the vector fields {\u2202pi + q i \u2202z , \u2202qi , \u2202z }ni=1 which span the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group\nH2n+1 \u2282 Con(R2n+1 , \u03b7).\nThe main interest in Lagrangian and Legendrian submanifolds is with their global behavior.\nMoreover, generally they do not form foliations, but singular foliations, and the nature of the\nsingularities are often related to the topology of the underlying manifold.\nLet us relate Legendrian submanifolds of a contact manifold (M, D) to Lagrangian submanifolds of the symplectization (C(M ), \u03a9). Choosing a contact form we can write\n\u0001\n\u03a9 = d r 2 \u03b7 = 2rdr \u2227 \u03b7 + r 2 d\u03b7.\nSo we see that a Legendrian submanifold L of (M, D) lifts to an isotropic submanifold L\u0303 of\n(C(M ), \u03a9) which by equation (1) is independent of the choice of contact form \u03b7. Since Lagrangian submanifolds L of (C(M ), \u03a9) have dimension n + 1, the lift L\u0303 is a codimension one\nsubmanifold of some L.\n\n2.6\n\nInvariants of contact structures\n\nIt is well known that as in symplectic geometry there are no local invariants in contact geometry.\nIndeed, if (Dt , \u03b7t ) denotes a 1-parameter family of contact structures on M with t \u2208 [0, 1], then\nGray's theorem says that there exists a diffeomorphism \u03c6t : M \u2212\u2212\u2192M such that \u03c6\u2217t \u03b7t = f\u03c6t \u03b70\nfor each t \u2208 [0, 1]. The simplest invariant is the first Chern class c1 (D) of the symplectic vector\nbundle (D, d\u03b7). Note two remarks: first since the set of isomorphism classes of symplectic\nvector bundles coincides with the set of isomorphism classes of complex vector bundles, the\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n7\n\nChern classes of D are well defined; second, c1 (D) is independent of the choice of contact form \u03b7\nsince if \u03b7 \u2032 = f \u03b7 for some nowhere vanishing smooth function on M , then equation (1) holds. So\nif c1 (D \u2032 ) 6= c1 (D), then the contact structures D and D \u2032 are inequivalent.\nHowever, all the contact structures in Theorem 1 have c1 (D) = 0. Thus, it is important to\ndistinguish contact structures with the same first Chern class. Fortunately, this can be done with\ncontact homology which is a piece of the larger symplectic field theory of Eliashberg, Givental,\nand Hofer [32]. We do not go into details here as it would take us too far afield, but only sketch\nthe idea and refer to the literature [15, 16, 32] for details. The idea is to construct a Floer-type\nhomology theory on the free loop space of a contact manifold M . Fix a contact form \u03b7 and\nconsider the action functional A : C \u221e (S 1 ; M ) \u2192 R, defined by\nA(\u03b3) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03b7.\n\u03b3\n\nThe critical points of A are closed orbits of the Reeb vector field of \u03b7, and the gradient trajectories, considered as living in the symplectization C(M ) of M are pseudoholomorphic curves which\nare cylindrically asymptotic over closed Reeb orbits. The idea then is to construct a chain complex C\u2217 generated by closed Reeb orbits of a suitably generic Reeb vector field. The homology\nof this complex is called contact homology, and its grading is determined by the Conley\u2013Zehnder\nindex (or Robbin\u2013Salamon index) which roughly speaking measures the twisting of nearby Reeb\norbits about a closed Reeb orbit. The differential in this complex is given by a suitable count of\npseudoholomorphic curves in the symplectization C(M ) of M . Assuming a certain transversality\ncondition holds3 , the contact homology ring HC\u2217 is an invariant of the contact structure, and\nthus can be used to distinguish contact structures with the same first Chern class.\nAnother invariant of a contact manifold (M 2n+1, D) is its contactomorphism group Con(M, D);\nhowever, it is too big to be of much use. On the other hand the number n(D, k) of conjugacy\nclasses of maximal tori of dimension k \u2264 n + 1 in Con(M, D) is also an invariant, so it too can be\nused to distinguish contact structures. The problem here is that unlike the symplectomorphism\ngroup it is difficult to get a precise answer for n(D, k). In our proof of Theorem 1 given in\nSection 4.2 we can only obtain a lower bound for the number of conjugacy classes of 3-tori,\nnamely n(Dp , 3) \u2265 \u03c6(p).\n\n3\n\nToric contact structures as completely integrable Hamiltonian\nsystems\n\nWhile completely integrable Hamiltonian systems in symplectic geometry have a long and distinguished history, as mentioned previously the contact version of complete integrability has been\nconsidered only fairly recently [9, 10, 21, 46, 44]. In symplectic geometry complete integrability\ncan be defined in terms of certain possibly singular foliations called Lagrangian foliations, and\nthe vectors tangent to the leaves of this foliation provide an Abelian Lie algebra of infinitesimal\nsymplectic transformations of one half the dimension of the manifold at least locally. The situation in contact geometry is somewhat more subtle. While the contact bundle D does have\na similar foliation, the Legendre foliation, its generic leaves have dimension one less than complete integrability requires. Moreover, non-trivial sections of D are never infinitesimal contact\ntransformations, so one must extend these sections first. Then one could just add in the Reeb\nvector field to obtain an Abelian Lie algebra of the correct dimension. However, this falls short\nof capturing all cases.\n3\n\nA full treatment of the transversality problem awaits the completion of polyfold theory by Hofer, Wysocki,\nand Zehnder. See for example [41] and references therein.\n\n\f8\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nRecall that in symplectic geometry a Hamiltonian for the symplectic structure \u03c9 is a smooth\nfunction H such that X \u03c9 = \u2212dH where X is an infinitesimal symplectomorphism, that is,\n\u00a3X \u03c9 = 0. However, such an H exists only if the de Rham cohomology class of X \u03c9 vanishes.\nWhen it does exist the corresponding vector field XH is called a Hamiltonian vector field and the\ntriple (N, \u03c9, XH ) is called a Hamiltonian system. Unlike the symplectic case, contact structures\nare automatically Hamiltonian; however, one needs to choose a certain isomorphism as described\nbelow.\n\n3.1\n\nContact Hamiltonian systems\n\nIt is a well known result of Libermann (cf. [50]) that a choice of contact 1-form \u03b7 gives an\nisomorphism between the Lie algebra of infinitesimal contact transformations con(M, D) and\nthe Lie algebra of smooth functions C \u221e (M ) by sending X \u2208 con(M, D) to \u03b7(X) \u2208 C \u221e (M ). The\nLie algebra structure on C \u221e (M ) is given by the Jacobi bracket {\u03b7(X), \u03b7(Y )}\u03b7 = \u03b7([X, Y ]). We\nthen call the function \u03b7(X) the contact Hamiltonian associated to the contact vector field X.\nSo any smooth function f on M can be a contact Hamiltonian, but it entails a choice of contact\nform. Moreover, as indicated the Jacobi bracket itself depends on the choice of contact form.\nLet \u03b7 \u2032 = f \u03b7 be another contact form compatible with the co-orientation, so f > 0 everywhere,\nand let g, h \u2208 C \u221e (M ). Then the corresponding Jacobi brackets are related by\n{g, h}\u03b7\u2032 = f\n\n\u001a\n\ng h\n,\nf f\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n\n\u03b7\n\nNote that unlike the Poisson bracket, the Jacobi bracket does not satisfy the Leibniz rule,\nand {g, 1}\u03b7 = 0 if and only if [Xg , R\u03b7 ] = 0 where R\u03b7 is the Reeb vector field of \u03b7, and Xg is\nthe Hamiltonian vector field corresponding to g. Furthermore, it is well known [50, 22] that\nthe centralizer of R\u03b7 in con(M, D) is the Lie subalgebra con(M, \u03b7). If we fix a contact form\n\u03b7 and consider a Hamiltonian hX = \u03b7(X), we can contract equation (2) with the Reeb vector\nfield R\u03b7 of \u03b7 and use the well known Cartan equation \u00a3X \u03b7 = X d\u03b7 + dhX to give aX = R\u03b7 hX .\nThus, under the isomorphism defined above the Lie subalgebra con(M, \u03b7) of con(M, D) leaving \u03b7\ninvariant is identified with the Lie subalgebra C \u221e (M )R\u03b7 of smooth functions that are invariant\nunder the flow of the Reeb vector field.\nConversely, fixing a contact form \u03b7 the function h \u2208 C \u221e (M ) gives a unique Hamiltonian\nvector field Xh \u2208 con(M, D) that satisfies h = \u03b7(Xh ). Thus, a Hamiltonian contact structure is\na quadruple (M, D, \u03b7, h). Although any smooth function can be chosen as a Hamiltonian, it is\noften convenient to choose the function 1 = \u03b7(R\u03b7 ) as the Hamiltonian, making the Reeb vector\nfield R\u03b7 the Hamiltonian vector field. We call this a Reeb type Hamiltonian contact structure\nand denote it by (M, D, \u03b7, 1). It consists only of a contact structure D together with a choice of\ncontact form \u03b7 such that D = ker \u03b7 and the Hamiltonian is understood to be the function 1.\nIt is sometimes convenient to view \u03b7(X) in terms of a moment map. Let con(M, D)\u2217 denote\no\u2212\n\u2212\u2192con(M, D)\u2217 by\nthe algebraic dual of con(M, D), and define the moment map \u03a5 : D+\nh\u03a5(p, \u03b7), Xi = \u03b7(X)(p).\nSo \u03a5(p, \u03b7) \u2208 con(M, D)\u2217 is identified with the linear function evp \u25e6 \u03b7 : con(M, D)\u2212\u2212\u2192R where\nevp is the evaluation map at p. Fixing the isomorphism \u03b7 : con(M, D)\u2212\u2212\u2192C \u221e (M ) identifies the\nimage of \u03a5 in con(M, D)\u2217 with the smooth functions \u03b7(X). We usually consider restricting the\nmoment map to certain finite dimensional Lie subalgebras g of con(M, D), and we identify the\ndual g\u2217 with the vector space {\u03b7(X) | X \u2208 g}.\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n3.2\n\n9\n\nFirst integrals\n\nWe say that a smooth function f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) is a first integral of the contact Hamiltonian\nstructure (M, D, \u03b7, h) if f is constant along the flow of the Hamiltonian vector field, that is if\nXh f = 0. Unlike the symplectic case a contact Hamiltonian is not necessarily a first integral of\nits Hamiltonian structure, that is it is not necessarily constant along its own flow!\nLemma 1. Let (M, D, \u03b7, h) be a contact Hamiltonian system. Then the following holds:\nXh f = (R\u03b7 h)f + {h, f }\u03b7 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn particular, the Hamiltonian function h itself is a first integral if and only if h \u2208 C \u221e (M )R\u03b7 ,\nor equivalently Xh lies in the subalgebra con(M, \u03b7).\nProof . We have\n\u0001\nXh f = \u00a3Xh \u03b7(Xf ) = (\u00a3Xh \u03b7)(Xf ) + \u03b7([Xh , Xf ]) = af + {h, f }\u03b7\n\nfor some a \u2208 C \u221e (M ). But we also have\na = a\u03b7(R\u03b7 ) = (\u00a3Xh \u03b7)(R\u03b7 ) = (Xh\n\nd\u03b7)(R\u03b7 ) + dh(R\u03b7 ) = R\u03b7 h\n\nwhich gives equation (3). For the special case of f = h, we have\nXh h = (R\u03b7 h)h.\n\n(4)\n\nSo we see that h is constant along its own flow if and only if it is constant along the flow\nof the Reeb vector field. But R\u03b7 h = 0 if and only if h \u2208 C \u221e (M )R\u03b7 which is equivalent to\nXh \u2208 con(M, \u03b7).\n\u0004\nThis begs the question: given a Hamiltonian function f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) does there always exist a\ncontact form \u03b7 such that f is constant along the flow of the Reeb vector field of \u03b7, or equivalently\ngiven X \u2208 con(M, D) does there always exist an \u03b7 such that X \u2208 con(M, \u03b7)? The answer is no\nas now shown.\nProposition 1. Let (M, D) be a co-oriented contact manifold. Then there exist functions h \u2208\nC \u221e (M ) that are not a first integral of their Hamiltonian system (M, D, \u03b7, h) for any contact\nform \u03b7.\nProof . At each point of M we know that R\u03b7 is transversal to D. So we choose any h \u2208 C \u221e (M )\nsuch that at p \u2208 M we have ker dhp = Dp . Then R\u03b7 h(p) 6= 0, and the result follows from\nLemma 1.4\n\u0004\nIn the symplectic case the fact that a Hamiltonian h and a function f commute under Poisson\nbracket is equivalent to f being a first integral which is also equivalent to the vector fields Xh\nand Xf being isotropic with respect to the symplectic form \u03c9. These equivalences no longer\nhold in the contact case. To have a viable theory in the contact case we should restrict our class\nof Hamiltonians.\nDefinition 1. We say that a contact Hamiltonian h is good if there exists a contact form \u03b7 such\nthat h is constant along the flow of the Reeb vector field R\u03b7 , or equivalently Xh h = 0. More\nexplicitly, we say that h is a good Hamiltonian with respect to \u03b7. With this \u03b7 chosen we also say\nthat the contact Hamiltonian system (M, D, \u03b7, h) is good.\n4\n\nI thank a referee for this very concise proof.\n\n\f10\n\nC.P. Boyer\nWe now give some straightforward results for good Hamiltonian systems.\n\nLemma 2. Let (M, D, \u03b7, h) be a good contact Hamiltonian system. Then\n1. f \u2208 C \u221e (M ) is a first integral of (M, D, \u03b7, h) if and only if {h, f }\u03b7 = 0.\n2. If f is a first integral of h, then h is a first integral of f if and only if f is constant along\nthe Reeb flow of R\u03b7 , i.e. f is a good Hamiltonian with respect to \u03b7.\n3. If f is good with respect to \u03b7 then f is a first integral of h if and only if h is a first integral\nof f .\n4. Suppose that h and f are mutual first integrals of each other, then f is good with respect\nto \u03b7.\n5. If f is good with respect to \u03b7 then the pointwise linear span of {Xh , Xf } is isotropic with\nrespect to d\u03b7 if and only if {h, f }\u03b7 = 0.\n6. If f is a first integral of (M, D, \u03b7, h), then the pointwise linear span of {Xh , Xf } is isotropic\nwith respect to d\u03b7 if and only if Xf h = 0, or equivalently f is good with respect to \u03b7.\n7. If f is a first integral of h, then Xh , Xf span an Abelian subalgebra of con(M, \u03b7).\nProof . Items (1)\u2013(4) follow directly from Lemma 1 and Definition 1. (5) and (6) follow from (1)\nand\nd\u03b7(Xh , Xf ) = Xh f \u2212 Xf h \u2212 {h, f }\u03b7 = Xh f \u2212 (R\u03b7 f )h.\nFinally, Lemma 1 implies that Xh , Xf \u2208 con(M, \u03b7). Since f is a first integral of h, we have\n\u03b7([Xh , Xf ]) = {h, f }\u03b7 = 0. But since the only infinitesimal contact transformation that is\na section of D is the 0 vector field, we have [Xh , Xf ] = 0 which proves (7).\n\u0004\nRemark 1. Notice that the Lie algebra C \u221e (M )R\u03b7 is the set of all good Hamiltonians with\nrespect to \u03b7.\nRemark 2. More generally the last statement in the proof of Lemma 2 implies that {h, f }\u03b7 = 0\nif and only if [Xh , Xf ] = 0, and the latter is an Abelian subalgebra of the Lie algebra con(M, D)\nof infinitesimal contact transformations.\n\n3.3\n\nCompletely integrable contact Hamiltonian systems\n\nAs in symplectic geometry the notion of functions in involution is important; however, in contact\ngeometry it depends on a choice of contact form. For example, given two vector fields X, Y \u2208\ncon(M, D), a choice of contact form \u03b7 gives a pair of functions \u03b7(X), \u03b7(Y ) \u2208 C \u221e (M ). The vector\nfields commute if and only if the two functions are in involution. However, choosing a different\ncontact form \u03b7 \u2032 = f \u03b7 where f is nowhere vanishing gives two different functions, f \u03b7(X), f \u03b7(Y )\nin involution.\nDefinition 2. Let (M, D, \u03b7, h) be a contact Hamiltonian system. A subset {h = f1 , f2 , . . . , fk }\nof smooth functions is said to be in involution if {fi , fj }\u03b7 = 0 for all i, j = 1, . . . , k.\nIf h is good with respect to \u03b7 then it follows from (1) of Lemma 2 that the fj are all first\nintegrals of h; however, the symmetry of the symplectic case does not hold in general. The\nfunction h may not be a first integral of fj for j = 2, . . . , k, since fj is not necessarily a good\nHamiltonian with respect to \u03b7.\nDefinition 3. Let (M, D, \u03b7, h) be a contact Hamiltonian system. We say that a subset {g1 , . . . ,\ngk } \u2282 C \u221e (M ) is independent if the corresponding set {Xg1 , . . . , Xgk } of Hamiltonian vector\nfields is pointwise linearly independent on a dense open subset.\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n11\n\nRemark 3. Unlike the symplectic case this is not equivalent to the condition dg1 \u2227 * * * \u2227 dgk 6= 0\non a dense open subset of M , since the latter does not hold when one of the Hamiltonian\nvector fields is R-proportional to the Reeb field whose Hamiltonian is the function 1. Contact\nHamiltonian systems with Hamiltonian equal to 1 are both interesting and important as we shall\nsee.\nDefinition 4. A Hamiltonian contact structure (M, D, \u03b7, h) is said to be completely integrable\nif there exists n + 1 first integrals, h, f1 , . . . , fn , that are independent and in involution. We\ndenote such a Hamiltonian system by (M, D, \u03b7, h, {fi }ni=1 ).\nIt follows from equation (3) of Lemma 1 that a completely integrable Hamiltonian contact\nstructure (M, D, \u03b7, h, {fi }ni=1 ) is automatically good. However, unlike the symplectic case, h may\nnot be a first integral of fi , and the subspace spanned by the corresponding vector fields may\nnot be isotropic. From Lemma 2 we have\nProposition 2. Suppose that the good Hamiltonian contact structure (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, h) has k + 1\nindependent first integrals h = f0 , f1 , . . . , fk with k \u2264 n. Then on a dense open subset the\ncorresponding Hamiltonian vector fields pointwise span a (k + 1)-dimensional isotropic subspace\nwith respect to d\u03b7 if and only if fi is good with respect to \u03b7 for all i = 1, . . . , k.\nNevertheless, such contact Hamiltonian structures lift to the usual symplectic Hamiltonian\nstructures on the cone.\nProposition 3. Let (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, h) be a good contact Hamiltonian system. The maximal\nnumber of independent first integrals of the system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, h) that are in involution is\nn + 1. In particular, a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system on (M, D) lifts to\na completely integrable Hamiltonian system on (C(M ), \u03a9).\nProof . As discussed at the end of Section 2.4 we can lift the independent Hamiltonian vector\nfields of the first integrals to the symplectization (C(M ), \u03a9), and a direct computation [18]\nshows that an Abelian subalgebra of con(M, D) lifts to an Abelian subalgebra in sym(C(M ), \u03a9).\nThe maximal dimension of such an Abelian subalgebra is n + 1.\n\u0004\nGenerally, the Hamiltonian vector fields may not be complete, so they do not integrate to an\nelement of the contactomorphism group Con(M, D), but only to the corresponding pseudogroup.\nEven if the manifold is compact so the Abelian Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields integrates\nto an Abelian group A \u2282 Con(M, D), it may not be a closed Lie subgroup of Con(M, D) as we\nshall see in Example 2 below.\nDefinition 5. We say that the completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M, D, \u03b7, h,\n{fi }ni=1 ) is completely good if the first integral fi is good with respect to \u03b7 for all i = 1, . . . , n.\nFrom the definitions it follows that\nProposition 4. A completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M, D, \u03b7, h = f0 , fi , . . . , fn )\nis completely good if and only if the corresponding commuting Hamiltonian vector fields Xf0 , . . . ,\nXfn lie in the subalgebra con(M, \u03b7).\nMost of the known completely integrable contact Hamiltonian systems are completely good,\nbut here is a simple example which is not completely good.\nExample 1. Take M = R3 with standard coordinates (x, y, z) and standard contact form\n\u03b7 = dz \u2212 ydx. The Reeb vector field is R\u03b7 = \u2202z . Take h = \u2212y as the Hamiltonian which is good\nwith respect to \u03b7 and take f = z as a first integral. The first integral f is not good with respect\n\n\f12\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nto \u03b7 since R\u03b7 f = \u2202z f = 1. The functions h and f are in involution, since the corresponding\nvector fields, which are\nXh = \u2202x ,\n\nXf = z\u2202z + y\u2202y ,\n\ncommute. However, they are not isotropic with respect to d\u03b7 since d\u03b7(Xh , Xf ) = y = \u2212h 6= 0.\nA question that arises is whether there exists a different contact form \u03b7 \u2032 in D such that the\nsystem (R3 , D, \u03b7 \u2032 , h, f ) is completely good. So we look for a smooth positive function g on R3\nsuch that \u03b7 \u2032 = g\u03b7 that satisfies both \u00a3Xf (g\u03b7) = 0 and \u00a3Xh (g\u03b7) = 0. This implies gx = 0 and\n\u0001\n0 = \u00a3Xf (g\u03b7) = (Xf g)\u03b7 + g\u00a3Xf \u03b7 = Xf g + g \u03b7.\n\nThus, g must be independent of x and homogeneous of degree \u22121 in y and z. But there is no\nsuch positive smooth function on R3 . So this completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system\nis not completely good with respect to any contact form representing D = ker \u03b7. Notice also\nthat the same argument shows that the Hamiltonian z is not a good Hamiltonian with respect\nto any \u03b7 representing the standard contact structure (M, D = ker \u03b7).\nNevertheless this contact Hamiltonian system lifts to a completely integrable Hamiltonian\nsystem on the symplectic cone C(M ) \u2248 R3 \u00d7 R+ . In coordinates (x, y, z, r) the symplectic form\nis\n\u03a9 = r 2 dx \u2227 dy + 2rdr \u2227 (dz \u2212 ydx).\nThe lifted vector fields are X\u0302h = \u2202x and X\u0302f = z\u2202z +y\u2202y \u2212 12 r\u2202r with Hamiltonians \u2212r 2 y and r 2 z,\nrespectively.\nDefinition 6. A completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 = h, f1 , . . . ,\nfn ) is of Reeb type if fi = 1 for some i = 0, . . . , n.\nOf course, this is equivalent to the condition that the Reeb vector field R\u03b7 lies in the Abelian\nLie algebra spanned by the Hamiltonian vector fields Xf0 , . . . , Xfn . We have\nTheorem 2. A completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 = h, f1 , . . . ,\nfn ) of Reeb type is completely good.\nProof . It is well known that the centralizer of the Reeb vector field R\u03b7 of a contact form \u03b7 in\ncon(M, D) is the subalgebra con(M, \u03b7). So the condition {1, fi }\u03b7 = 0 implies that Xi \u2208 con(M, \u03b7)\nfor all i and this implies R\u03b7 fi = 0 for all i.\n\u0004\nThe converse does not hold. Example 2 below is a completely good contact Hamiltonian\nsystem on a compact manifold that is not of Reeb type. The contact Hamiltonian systems that\nwe are mainly concerned with in this paper are completely good.\nDefinition 7. A completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 , f1 , . . . , fn )\nis said to be of toric type if the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields Xf0 , . . . , Xfn form the\nLie algebra of a torus T n+1 \u2282 Con(M, D). In this case we also call (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7) a toric contact\nmanifold.\nExample 2. Consider the unit sphere bundle S(T \u2217 T n+1 ) of the cotangent bundle of an (n +\n1)-torus T n+1 . In the canonical\n(x0 , . . . , xn ; p0 , . . . , pn ) on the cotangent bundle,\nPn coordinates\n\u2217\nn+1\n2\nS(T T\n) is represented by i=0 pi = 1, with (x0 , . . . , xn ) being the coordinates\non the torus\nP\nn+1\nT\n. It is easy to see that the restriction of the canonical 1-form \u03b8 = i pi dxi on T \u2217 T n+1 to\nS(T \u2217 T n+1 ) is a contact form \u03b7 = \u03b8|S(T \u2217 T n+1 ) on S(T \u2217 T n+1 ). Moreover, this contact structure\nis toric since T n+1 acts freely on S(T \u2217 T n+1 ) and leaves \u03b7 invariant. The Reeb vector field R\u03b7\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n13\n\nP\nof \u03b7 is the restriction of ni=0 pi \u2202xi to S(T \u2217 T n+1 ), and this does not lie in the Lie algebra tn+1\nof the torus which is spanned by \u2202xi . So this toric contact structure is not of Reeb type.\nNote that the vector fields {R\u03b7 , \u2202x0 , . . . , \u2202xn } form an (n + 2)-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra,\nbut the independence condition of Definition 3 fails. Note, however, that the vector fields\n{R\u03b7 , \u2202x1 , . . . , \u2202xn } do form an (n + 1)-dimensional Abelian Lie algebra and they are independent\non the dense open subset (p0 6= 0) in S(T \u2217 T n+1 ). This gives a completely good integrable\nsystem of Reeb type on S(T \u2217 T n+1 ) which, however, is not of toric type, since the vector field R\u03b7\ngenerates an R action, and there are orbits of this R action whose closure is T n+1 . So the\nsubgroup T n \u00d7 R generated by this completely integrable system is not a closed Lie subgroup\nof Con(S(T \u2217 T n+1 ), \u03b7).\nExample 3. An example of a completely good integrable contact Hamiltonian system of Reeb\ntype that is not toric is given by the standard Sasakian contact structure on the Heisenberg\ngroup H2n+1 [17]. As a contact manifold H2n+1 is just R2n+1 with contact form\n\u03b7 = dz \u2212\n\nn\nX\n\nyi dxi\n\ni=1\n\ngiven in global coordinates (x1 , . . . , xn , y1 , . . . , yn , z). The connected component of the Sasakian\nautomorphism group is the semi-direct product (U (n) \u00d7 R+ ) \u22c9 H2n+1 . Let Xi denote the vector\nfields corresponding to the diagonal elements of U (n). Then the functions (1, \u03b7(X1 ), . . . , \u03b7(Xn ))\nmake (H2n+1 , D, \u03b7, 1) into a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system of Reeb type\nwhich is not toric since the corresponding Abelian group is T n \u00d7 R where the Reeb vector field\nR\u03b7 = \u2202z generates a real line R.\nAnother completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system on H2n+1 is obtained by taking\nthe\nP Hamiltonian as a linear combination of the functions (\u03b7(X1 ), . . . , \u03b7(Xn+)), say the sum h =\ni \u03b7(Xi ), and adding the function \u03b7(D) where D is the generator of the R gives a completely\nintegrable contact Hamiltonian system on H2n+1 which by Proposition 4 is not completely good,\nsince D 6\u2208 con(M, \u03b7).\nCompletely integrable contact structures of toric type were first studied in [9], but their\ndefinition was local in nature, hence more general than ours, involving the condition of transverse\nellipticity. The passage from local to global involves the vanishing of the monodromy of the socalled Legendre lattice. On compact manifolds global toric actions were classified by Lerman\nin [46] where it is shown that the toric contact structures of Reeb type are precisely those having\na description in terms of polyhedra as in the symplectic case. By averaging over the torus one\nconstructs a contact form in the contact structure D that is invariant under the action of the\ntorus. Thus,\nProposition 5. For a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system of toric type there is\na contact form \u03b7 such that the completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 ,\nf1 , . . . , fn ) is completely good.\nMore generally one can use a slice theorem [46, 22] to prove\nProposition 6. Let (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 , f1 , . . . , fn ) be a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian\nsystem, and suppose that the corresponding Hamiltonian vector fields {Xfi }ni=0 form the Lie\nalgebra of an (n + 1)-dimensional Abelian subgroup A of Con(M, D) whose action on M is\nproper. Then there exists a contact form \u03b70 representing D such that A \u2282 Con(M, \u03b70 ) and the\ncorresponding completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b70 , f0 , f1 , . . . , fn ) is\ncompletely good.\n\n\f14\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nThe Lie algebra a of A provides M with a singular foliation Fa whose generic leaves are\nsubmanifolds of maximal dimension n + 1. Note that Fa is a true (n + 1)-dimensional foliation\non a dense open subset W \u2282 M . Let \u03c0D : T M \u2212\u2212\u2192D denote the natural projection. Then the\nimage \u03c0D (a) defines another singular foliation on M called the Legendre foliation whose generic\nleaves are n-dimensional, called Legendrian submanifolds. The leaves of both of these foliations\nare endowed with a canonical affine structure [49, 56]. In particular, compact leaves are tori.\nThis is part of the contact analogue of the well known Arnold\u2013Liouville theorem in symplectic\ngeometry.\n\n3.4\n\nConjugacy classes of contact Hamiltonian systems\n\nLet (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 , f1 , . . . , fn ) be a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system. Then\nthe vector fields {Xfi }ni=0 span an (n+1)-dimensional Abelian Lie subalgebra an+1 of con(M, D).\nSuch Lie subalgebras are maximal in the sense that they have the maximal possible dimension\nfor Abelian subalgebras of con(M, D). We are interested in the conjugacy classes of completely\nintegrable Hamiltonian systems. These should arise from conjugacy classes of maximal Abelian\nsubalgebras of con(M, D). First notice that by indentifying con(M, D) as the Lie algebra of\nleft invariant (or right invariant) vector fields on M leaving D invariant, we can make the\nidentification Ad\u03c6 X = \u03c6\u2217 X for X \u2208 con(M, D) and \u03c6 \u2208 Con(M, D). Thus, by duality we have\nAd\u2217\u03c6 \u03b7 = (\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b7. So under conjugation if h = \u03b7(X) and h\u2032 = ((\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b7)(\u03c6\u2217 X) we have\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u22121\nh\u2032 (p) = ((\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b7)(\u03c6\u2217 X)(p) = \u03b7(\u03c6\u22121\n\u2217 \u03c6\u2217 X)(\u03c6 (p)) = \u03b7(X)(\u03c6 (p)) = (h \u25e6 \u03c6 )(p).\n\nThis leads to\nDefinition 8. We say the contact Hamiltonian systems (M, D, \u03b7, h) and (M, D, \u03b7 \u2032 , h\u2032 ) are conjugate if there exists \u03c6 \u2208 Con(M, D) such that \u03b7 \u2032 = (\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b7 and h\u2032 = h \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 .\nNow goodness is preserved under conjugation. More explicitly,\nLemma 3. If h \u2208 C \u221e (M ) is good with respect to the contact form \u03b7, then h\u2032 = h \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 is good\nwith respect to \u03b7 \u2032 = (\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b7 for any \u03c6 \u2208 Con(M, D).\nProof . From equation (4) any smooth function h is good with respect to \u03b7 if and only if\nXh h = 0. We have\nXh\u2032 h\u2032 = (Ad\u03c6 Xh )(h \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 ) = (\u03c6\u2217 Xh )(h \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 ) = d((\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 h)(\u03c6\u2217 Xh )\n= ((\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 dh)(\u03c6\u2217 Xh ) = dh(\u03c6\u22121\n\u2217 \u03c6\u2217 Xh ) = dh(Xh ) = Xh h = 0.\n\n\u0004\n\nSimilarly, two completely integrable contact Hamiltonian systems (M, D, \u03b7, h, {fi }ni=1 ) and\n(M, D, \u03b7 \u2032 , h\u2032 , {fi\u2032 }ni=1 ) are conjugate if there exists \u03c6 \u2208 Con(M, D) such that \u03b7 \u2032 = (\u03c6\u22121 )\u2217 \u03b7, h\u2032 =\nh \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 , and fi\u2032 = fi \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 for all i = 1, . . . , n. It is easy to see that\nLemma 4. If a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 , f1 , . . . , fn ) is\neither completely good, of Reeb type, or toric type, so is any conjugate of (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, f0 , f1 , . . . ,\nfn ) by any element of Con(M, D).\nIn the case of a completely good integrable contact Hamiltonian system we can consider the\nconjugacy of an entire Abelian algebra instead of the functions individually. In this case the\nconjugate system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7 \u2032 , f0\u2032 , f1\u2032 , . . . , fn\u2032 ) satisfies\n\u2032\n\n\u0001\n\u22121 \u2217\n\n\u03b7 = \u03c6\n\n\u03b7,\n\nfi\u2032\n\n=\n\nn\nX\n\nAij fj \u25e6 \u03c6\u22121 for all i = 0, . . . , n,\n\nj=0\n\nwhere Aij are the components of a matrix A \u2208 GL(n + 1, R).\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n15\n\nConjugacy classes of completely good integrable contact Hamiltonian systems correspond to\nconjugacy classes of maximal Abelian subalgebras of dimension n+1 in con(M, D) whose projections onto D are isotropic with respect to d\u03b7 for any (hence, all) contact form \u03b7 representing D.\nThe completely integrable contact Hamiltonian systems considered in Section 4 are toric, hence\ncompletely good. In particular, we are interested in the inequivalent ways that a given contact\nHamiltonian system (M 2n+1 , D, \u03b7, h) may be completely integrable. This corresponds to maximal Abelian subalgebras of con(M, D) containing a fixed one-dimensional subalgebra generated\nby Xh . We give an important example of this in Section 4 where the distinct conjugacy classes\nare related to inequivalent Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 . In this case the Hamiltonian\nvector field is the Reeb vector field of a preferred contact form, and the contact Hamiltonian\nsystems are actually T 2 -equivariantly equivalent, but not T 3 -equivariantly equivalent.\nThe general situation we are interested in is as follows: consider a contact structure D\non a manifold M of dimension 2n + 1, and fix a contact form \u03b7. Suppose that the group\nCon(M, \u03b7) has exactly n(D, n + 1) conjugacy classes of maximal tori of dimension n + 1. Thus,\nthe Hamiltonian system (M, D, \u03b7, 1) has at least n(D, n + 1) inequivalent ways that make it\ncompletely integrable. Moreover, it is easy to construct examples [19, 18] where n(D, n + 1)\nis quite large. In fact, for the toric contact structures Y p,q on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 discussed in Section 4,\nthere are at least p \u2212 1 conjugacy classes of maximal tori of dimension 3 when p is prime. So\nthe corresponding first integrals cannot all be independent. The same is true on the level of\nthe symplectic base space discussed at the end of Section 2.1. A question that arose during the\nconference is whether this phenomenon is at all related to that of superintegrability. However, it\nappears that this is not the case. In symplectic geometry superintegrable Hamiltonian systems\narose from the noncommutative or generalized Arnold\u2013Liouville theorem of Nehorosev [54], and\nMishchenko and Fomenko [53], and recently this notion has come to the forefront of mathematical\nphysics (see for example [58, 33] and references therein). Nevertheless, it would be of interest\nto develop the non-commutative theory in the contact setting.\n\n4\n\nToric contact structures on S 2 \u00d7 S 3\n\nIn this section we consider the special case of toric contact structures, denoted by Y p,q where\np, q are relatively prime integers satisfying 0 < q < p, on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 that were first constructed\nin [36]. The contact bundle of these structures has vanishing first Chern class; however, they\nare not the most general toric contact structures with vanishing first Chern class. The latter\nwere studied in [28, 51]. Here for reasons of simplicity we consider only the case of the Y p,q .\nMore general toric contact structures, including ones with nonvanishing first Chern class, on S 3\nbundles over S 2 are considered in greater detail in [25].\n\n4.1\n\nCircle reduction of S 7\n\nThe structures Y p,q on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 can be obtained by the method of symmetry reduction from the\nstandard contact structure on S 7 by a certain circle action. For a review of contact reduction\nwe refer to Chapter 8 of [22], while complete details of this case can be found in [25]. Consider\nthe standard T 4 action on C4 given by zj 7\u2192 ei\u03b8j zj .

Assuming\nthis the procedure of contact reduction gives the quotient manifold Y p,q = S 7 /T (p, q) with its\ninduced contact structure Dp,q .\nProposition 7. The quotient contact manifold (Y p,q , Dp,q ) is diffeomorphic to S 2 \u00d7 S 3 .\nProof . (Outline.) By a result of Lerman [48] the condition gcd(q, p) = 1 implies that the\nmanifold Y p,q is simply connected and that H2 (Y p,q , Z) = Z. Furthermore, it is not difficult\nto see [25] that the first Chern class c1 (Dp,q ) vanishes, so the manifold is spin. The result then\nfollows by the Smale\u2013Barden classification of simply connected 5-manifolds.\n\u0004\nIt follows from [52] that the contact structures Y p,q are precisely the ones discovered in [36]\nthat admit Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics. We should also mention that the case (p, q) = (1, 0) admits\nthe well-known homogeneous Sasaki\u2013Einstein metric found over 30 years ago by Tanno [57]. Our\nproof expresses the Y p,q as S 1 -orbibundles over certain orbifold Hirzebruch surfaces. A connection between the Y p,q and Hirzebruch surfaces was anticipated by Abreu [1].\n\n4.2\n\nOutline of the proof of Theorem 1\n\nThe proof that the contact structures are inequivalent if p\u2032 6= p uses contact homology as very\nbriefly described in Section 2.6. For full details of a more general result we refer to [25]; however,\nthe case for the Y p,q was worked out by Abreu and Macarini [2], so we shall just refer to their\npaper for the proof.\n\u2032\nTo prove that the contact structures Y p,q and Y p,q are contactomorphic requires a judicious\nchoice of Reeb vector field in the Sasaki cone, or equivalently, a judicious choice of contact\nform. First the infinitesimal generator of the circle action given by equation (5) is Lp,q =\n(p\u2212q)H1 +(p+q)H2 \u2212p(H3 +H4 ) where Hj is the infinitesimal generator of the action zj 7\u2192 ei\u03b8j zj\non C4 restricted to S 3 \u00d7 S 3 . Choosing the vector field Rp,q = (p + q)H1 + (p \u2212 q)H2 + p(H3 + H4 )\ngives the T 2 -action generated by Lp,q and Rp,q as\n\u0001\nz 7\u2192 ei((p+q)\u03c6+(p\u2212q)\u03b8) z1 , ei((p\u2212q)\u03c6+(p+q)\u03b8 z2 , eip(\u03c6\u2212\u03b8) z3 , eip(\u03c6\u2212\u03b8) z4 .\nUpon making the substitutions \u03c8 = \u03c6 \u2212 \u03b8 and \u03c7 = (p \u2212 q)\u03c8 + 2p\u03b8 we obtain the action\n\u0001\nz 7\u2192 ei(2q\u03c8+\u03c7) z1 , ei\u03c7 z2 , eip\u03c8 z3 , eip\u03c8 z4 .\n\n(6)\n\nIt is easy to check that Rp,q is a Reeb vector field, that is \u03b7(Rp,q ) > 0 everywhere, where \u03b7 is the\ncontact form on Y p,q induced by the reduction procedure. Furthermore, the circle action on Y p,q\ngenerated by Rp,q is quasiregular and gives an orbifold Boothby\u2013Wang quotient space Zp,q . We\nnow identify this quotient as an orbifold Hirzebruch surface, that is a Hirzebruch surface with a\nnontrivial orbifold structure. To do so we equate the T 2 reduction of S 3 \u00d7 S 3 by the action (6)\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n17\n\nwith the C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 quotient of C2 \\ {0} \u00d7 C2 \\ {0} by the complexified TC2 -action with parameters\n\u03c4 , \u03b6:\n\u0001\nz 7\u2192 \u03c4 2q \u03b6z1 , \u03b6z2 , \u03c4 p z3 , \u03c4 p z4 .\n\n(7)\n\nSince p and q are relatively prime there are two cases to consider. If p is odd then equation (7)\nstays as is; however, if p is even we can redefine \u03c4 to give\n\u0001\nz 7\u2192 \u03c4 q \u03b6z1 , \u03b6z2 , \u03c4 p\u0303 z3 , \u03c4 p\u0303 z4 ,\nwhere p = 2p\u0303.\nWhen p is odd we define homogeneous coordinates in CP1 \u00d7CP2 by setting (w1 , w2 ) = (z3 , z4 )\nand (y1 , y2 , y3 ) = (z2p z32q , z2p z42q , z1p ), we see that the quotient space Zp,q is represented by the\nequation\nw12q y2 = w22q y1 .\nThis is well known to be the even Hirzebruch surface S2q which is diffeomorphic to S 2 \u00d7 S 2 .\nHowever, the divisors E = (z1 = 0) and F = (z2 = 0) are branch divisors with ramification\nindex p. So we have a non-trivial orbifold structure (S2q , \u2206p ) with\n\u2206p =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\u2212\np\n\n\u0013\n\n(E + F ).\n\nWhen p is even we get an orbifold Hirzebruch surface (Sq , \u2206p\u0303 ) with\n\u2206p\u0303 =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\u2212\n\n1\np\u0303\n\n\u0013\n\n(E + F ).\n\nIn this case q must be odd so we have an odd Hirzebruch surface Sq which is diffeomorphic to\nthe blow-up of CP2 at a point.\nRemark 4. The orbifold structure plays a crucial role in the existence of Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics\nin the Sasaki cone of Y p,q . In both cases the surfaces (S2q , \u2206p ) and (Sq , \u2206p\u0303 ) are log del Pezzo,\nthat is, the orbifold anticanonical divisor is ample; whereas, it is well known that the ordinary\nanticanonical divisor for a Hirzebruch surface Sk is ample only for k = 0, 1. So the orbifold\nstructure allows for positive Ricci curvature metrics on Y p,q realized as the total space of the\nS 1 -orbibundle or alternatively Seifert fibration over the log del Pezzo surfaces (Sk , \u2206p ).\nReturning to the proof of Theorem 1, we generalize a result of Karshon [42, 43] to show that\n\u2032\nY p,q and Y p,q are contactormophic. Let us assume that p is odd as the proof in the p even\ncase is similar. Karshon [43] shows that the smooth manifold S 2 \u00d7 S 2 with the symplectic form\n\u03c9 = \u03c91 +k\u03c92 where \u03c9i is the standard K\u00e4hler form on the ith copy of S 2 has exactly k conjugacy\nclasses of 2-tori in its symplectomorphism group, and that these correspond to different choices\nof compatible complex structures. In this way each even Hirzebruch surface S2q occurs with\n0 \u2264 q < k, and using her previous results [42] Karshon shows that they are all S 1 equivariantly\nsymplectomorphic.\nIn our case we have the orbifold Hirzebruch surface (S2q , \u2206p ) with the same symplectic form\n\u03c9 = \u03c91 + p\u03c92 as in the smooth case. Now let us write (S2q , \u2205) to denote the even Hirzebruch\nsurface with the trivial orbifold structure, that is the charts are just the standard manifold charts.\nIn this situation as emphasized in [39] we consider the map 1l : (S2q , \u2206)\u2212\u2212\u2192(S2q , \u2205) which is the\n\n\f18\n\nC.P. Boyer\n\nidentity as a set map, and a Galois cover with trivial Galois group. Now let 1 \u2264 q, q \u2032 < p and\nK : S2q \u2212\u2212\u2192S2q\u2032 be the Karshon symplectomorphism. Then we have a commutative diagram\nKp\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n(S2q , \u2206p )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e61l\ny\n\nK\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\n(S2q , \u2205)\n\n(S2q\u2032x, \u2206p )\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e61l\u22121\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n(S2q\u2032 , \u2205)\n\nwhich defines the upper horizontal arrow Kp and shows that it too is an S 1 -equivariant symplectomorphism. But it is easy to see that K leaves both divisors E and F invariant separately, and\nthis shows that Kp is an orbifold diffeomorphism, and hence, an orbifold symplectomorphism.\nBut then as shown in [47, 18] this symplectomorphism lifts to a T 2 -equivariant contactomor\u2032\nphism. Hence, the contact structures Y p,q and Y p,q are contactomorphic. This completes the\nproof of Theorem 1.\n\n4.3\n\nExtremal Sasakian metrics on S 2 \u00d7 S 3\n\nExtremal Sasakian structures are closely related to the better known extremal K\u00e4hlerian structures [27], and were first defined in [23]. They were studied further in [24, 19, 45].\nConsider the following deformation of a Sasakian structure S = (\u03be, \u03b7, \u03a6, g) by deforming\nthe contact form by sending \u03b7 7\u2192 \u03b7(t) = \u03b7 + t\u03b6 where \u03b6 is a basic 1-form with respect to\nthe characteristic foliation F\u03be defined by the Reeb vector field R\u03b7 = \u03be, that is, \u03b6 depends\nonly on the variables transverse to the Reeb field \u03be. Note that since the \u03b6 is basic \u03b7(t) has\nthe same Reeb vector field \u03be as \u03b7 for all t in a suitable interval containing 0 and such that\n\u03b7(t) \u2227 d\u03b7(t) 6= 0. Let L\u03be denote the 1-dimensional subbundle of the tangent bundle generated\nby \u03be, and set \u03bd(F\u03be ) = T M/L\u03be . Let J \u0304 denote the complex structure on \u03bd(F\u03be ) induced by \u03a6, and\n \u0304 denote the deformation space of such Sasakian structures. Following [23] we let sg\nlet S(\u03be, J)\ndenote the scalar curvature of g and define the \"energy functional\" E : S(\u03be, J \u0304)\u2212\u2192R by\nZ\ns2g d\u03bcg ,\n(8)\nE(S) =\nM\n\ni.e. the L2 -norm of the scalar curvature. Critical points S of this functional are called extremal\nSasakian structures. Similar to the K\u00e4hlerian case, the Euler-Lagrange equations for this functional give [23] the following statement. A Sasakian structure S \u2208 S(\u03be, J \u0304) is a critical point for\nthe energy functional (8) if and only if the gradient vector field \u2202g# sg is transversely holomorphic. In particular, Sasakian metrics with constant scalar curvature are extremal. Here \u2202g# is the\n \u0304 It is important to note that a Sasakian\n(1, 0)-gradient vector field defined by g(\u2202g# \u03c6, *) = \u2202\u03c6.\nmetric g is extremal if and only if the 'transverse metric' gD = d\u03b7 \u25e6 (\u03a6 \u2297 1l) is extremal in the\nK\u00e4hlerian sense which follows from the well known relation (cf. [22]) between scalar curvatures\nsg = sTg \u2212 2n where sTg is the scalar curvature of the transverse metric gD .\nWe now consider the toric contact structures Y p,q on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 . As mentioned in the introduction it is known [36] that for every relatively prime pair (p, q) with 1 \u2264 q < p there is a unique\nSasaki\u2013Einstein metric in the Sasaki cone of Y p,q . Sasaki\u2013Einstein metrics have constant scalar\ncurvature, and thus, define extremal Sasakian structures. In fact when c1 (D) = 0 any Sasakian\nmetric of constant scalar curvature is related by a transverse homothety to a Sasaki\u2013Einstein\nmetric. So there is a unique ray of Sasakian metrics with constant scalar curvature. Now fixing\nthe contact structure Dp up to isomorphism there are \u03c6(p) inequivalent toric contact structures\nassociated with Dp , hence, \u03c6(p) Sasaki cones t+\n3 (q), and each Sasaki cone has a unique ray of\n\n\fCompletely Integrable Contact Systems\n\n19\n\nconstant scalar curvature metrics. Moreover, by applying the Openness theorem of [23] there is\nan open cone e3 (q) \u2282 t+\n3 (q) of extremal Sasaki metrics about each of these rays.\nOther extremal Sasakian metrics in the toric contact structures Y p,q can be obtained by\na different choice of Reeb vector field.\nProposition 8. Consider the toric contact structure (Y p,q , Dp ) on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 obtained from the\ncircle reduction of Section 4.1. Let \u03b7 be the contact form whose Reeb vector field is\nR\u03b7 = (p \u2212 q)H1 + (p + q)H2 + p(H3 + H4 ).\nThen the induced Sasakian structure S = (R\u03b7 , \u03b7, \u03a6, g) is extremal with non-constant scalar\ncurvature.\nProof . The quotient space of Y p,q by the two torus T 2 generated by the vector fields Lp,q =\n(p \u2212 q)H1 + (p + q)H2 \u2212 p(H3 + H4 ) and R\u03b7 = (p \u2212 q)H1 + (p + q)H2 + p(H3 + H4 ) is\nCP(p\u0304\u2212 , p\u0304+ ) \u00d7 CP1\nwith the product complex structure where CP(p\u0304\u2212 , p\u0304+ ) is a weighted projective space, and\np+q\n(p\u0304\u2212 , p\u0304+ ) = (p \u2212 q, p + q) if p \u2212 q is odd, and (p\u0304\u2212 , p\u0304+ ) = ( p\u2212q\n2 , 2 ) if p \u2212 q is even. The\norbifold K\u00e4hler form on CP(p\u0304\u2212 , p\u0304+ ) \u00d7 CP1 is\n\u03c9 = p\u03c91 + gcd(p \u2212 q, p + q)\u03c92 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u03c9i is the standard Fubini\u2013Study form on the ith factor. Note that because of the conditions\non (p, q) the gcd(p \u2212 q, p + q) is either 1 or 2, and it is 2 only when p and q are both odd.\nNow according to Bryant [26] weighted projective spaces have Bochner-flat K\u00e4hler orbifold\nmetrics which by [29] are extremal. Moreover, when the weights are not all one the extremal\nmetrics have non-constant scalar curvature. The standard K\u00e4hler structure \u03c92 on CP1 has\nconstant scalar curvature, so the weighted product structure \u03c9 of equation (9) has the form\ns\u03c9 = p\u22121 s1 + c where s1 is the scalar curvature of \u03c91 and c is a constant. Since \u03c91 is extremal so\nis \u03c9, so the vector field \u2202\u03c9# s\u03c9 is holomorphic. Moreover, this lifts to a transversely holomorphic\nvector field on Y p,q which equals \u2202g# sg where sg is the scalar curvature of the Sasakian metric g\nimplying that g is extremal.\n\u0004\nAgain applying the openness theorem [23], we obtain an open cone of extremal metrics\ncontaining the extremal structure of Proposition 8. At this time we do not know whether the\nfull extremal set e3 (q) in t+\n3 (q) is connected. Note also that the pair (p\u0304\u2212 , p\u0304+ ) is never (1, 1), so\nthe first factor is always a weighted projective line, that is it is CP1 with a non-trivial orbifold\nstructure.\nIn [18, 19] the author introduced the notion of a Sasaki bouquet BN (D) associated to a contact\nstructure which consists of a union of N Sasaki cones. Thus, associated to the contact structure Dp on S 2 \u00d7 S 3 we have a bouquet B\u03c6(p) (Dp ) consisting of \u03c6(p) Sasaki cones. Moreover,\neach Sasaki cone has an extremal subset. Exactly how large these extremal sets are is unknown\nat this time. The only toric contact structures where the Sasakian extremal set is known to fill\nup the Sasaki cone is for the standard toric contact structure on the sphere S 2n+1 [23] and the\nstandard completely integrable contact structure of Reeb type (H2n+1 , D, \u03b7, 1) of Example 3 on\nthe Heisenberg group [17].\n\nAcknowledgements\nDuring the conference I enjoyed conversations with E.
