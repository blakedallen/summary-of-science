Since the first\nevidence of DM presence in galaxy clusters (e.g., Zwicky, 1933), the existence of\nmassive, non baryonic halos is consistent with present-day CMB surveys, large scale\ngalaxy clusters studies, and necessary, e.g., for a viable explanation of flat rotation\ncurves well outside visible disks of spiral galaxies (for an exhaustive review on DM\nrefer to, Freeman and McNamara, 2006). The current investigation aims to provide\nfurther insight on the tidal action induced by massive halos on hosted galaxies, taking\ninto consideration special sequences of two-component systems, intended to model\nearly-type galaxies (hereafter quoted as ETGs) and their hosting halos.\nThe idea of exploring two-component systems, a stellar spheroid completely embedded in a DM halo, moves from the fact that the virial potential energy (hereafter\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nValentinuzzi et al.\n\nquoted as VPE) of the stellar component, shows a non-monotonic trend as a function\nof the radius, as opposed to one-component systems. This behavior is induced by the\nDM halo tidal potential, and is more effective for shallower DM halo density profiles.\nThe occurrence of extremum points in potential energy could be highly rewarding, as\nin mechanics they correspond to stationary points and may be special configurations\nfor the system. These extremum points could be a key to the explanation of the so\ncalled \"tilt\" of the Fundamental Plane (FP) (see, Bender et al., 1992).\nThe current investigation is based on two ETGs density profiles of astrophysical\ninterest, using the formalism of the two-component virial theorem for an explicit\nexpression of the VPE of the stellar subsystem embedded in the DM halo. The models\nand related special sequences of two-component systems, intended to represent\nETGs, are defined in Section 2. An analysis of VPE extremum points, with the\nfurther restriction of energy conservation, is performed and discussed in Section 3.\nComparisons between model predictions and both data from observations and results\nfrom computer simulations, are made in Section 4. Conclusions are drawn in Section\n5.\nThe complete article is part of the book entitled Energy Research Developments: Tidal Energy, Energy Efficiency and Solar Energy, published\nby NOVA PUBLISHERS, and is available through the following web site:\nhttps://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product info.php?products id=7980.\n\nReferences\nBender, R., Burstein D., Faber, S.M. 1992, ApJ, 399, 462.\nBernardi, M., Sheth, R.K., Annis, J. and 28 coauthors 2003, AJ, 125, 1817.\nBertin, G., Ciotti L., Del Principe, M. 2002, A&A, 386, 149.\nBorriello A., Salucci, P. 2001, MNRAS, 323, 285.\nBrosche, P., Caimmi, R., Secco, L. 1983, A&A, 125, 338.\nCaimmi, R. 1991, Ap&SS, 180, 211.\nCaimmi, R. 1993, ApJ, 419, 615.\nCaimmi, R., and Marmo C. 2003, NewA, 8, 119.\nCaimmi, R. 2006, App. Math.
