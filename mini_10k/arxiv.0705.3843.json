The resulting high end slope of\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nthe black hole mass function at z = 6 is \u03b1 \u2248 \u22123.7, a value within the 1\u03c3 error\nbar for the bright end slope of the observed quasar luminosity function at z = 6.\nSubject headings: cosmology: theory - galaxies: high-redshift - early universe methods: N-body simulations\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBright quasars at z \u2248 6 are very luminous and rare objects that can can be detected out\nto huge cosmological distances in very large area surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(Fan et al. 2004). Their estimated space density is \u2248 2.2 * 10\u22129 (Mpc/h)\u22123 (Fan et al. 2004),\nthat is about one object per about 200 deg2 of sky, assuming a depth of \u2206z = 1 centered at\nz = 6.1 under the third year WMAP cosmology (Spergel et al. 2006). Their luminosity is\nthought to be due to accretion onto a super-massive black hole (e.g., see Hopkins et al. 2005).\nA common expectation is that the luminous high-z quasars sit at the center of the biggest\nproto-clusters at that time. Some observational evidence of over-densities of galaxies in two\ndeep HST-ACS fields containing a bright z=6 quasar has been claimed (Stiavelli et al. 2005;\nZhen et al. 2006), but it is unclear whether this is true in general. In fact an ACS image\nonly probes a long and narrow field of view of about 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 320(Mpc/h)3 in the redshift\nrange [5.6 : 6.6], so a significant number of detections may come from galaxies unrelated to\nthe environment of the host halo of the bright quasar.\nNumerical simulations to address the formation of bright quasars are extremely challenging given their low number density. A huge simulation cube with edge of & 700 Mpc/h\nis required just to expect, on average, one such object in the simulation box. A major computational investment, like the Millennium run (Springel et al. 2005), is required to resolve\nat high redshift (z & 20) virialized halos on this volume and to follow their merging history\ndown to z \u2248 6. Even assuming that the simulation volume is big enough that there is the\nexpectation to find halos hosting bright quasars, how can these halos be identified? In principle two, non mutually exclusive, alternatives appear plausible: either the super-massive\nblack holes are hosted in the most massive halos with the corresponding number density of\nSDSS quasars or these black holes have grown from the first PopIII Intermediate Mass Black\nHole seeds, therefore representing the descendant of the rarest density peaks that hosted\nfirst stars.\nThe first scenario implies that the mBH \u2212\u03c3 relation (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000; Gebhardt et al.\n2000) is already in place at high redshift (Volonteri et al. 2003; Hopkins et al. 2005; Di Matteo et al.\n2005). In that case multigrid simulations can be carried out to follow in detail the growth\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nof the supermassive black hole (e.g., see Li et al. 2006). In the second scenario the quasars\nprogenitors would be traced back to the first PopIII stars created in the universe within\n\u2248 106 M\u2299 mass halos virialized at z \u2248 50 (Bromm & Larson 2004; Abel et al. 2002). These\nPopIII stars are very massive M > 100M\u2299 , so after a short life of a few million years explode\nand may leave intermediate mass black holes, plausible seeds for the super-massive black\nholes observed at lower redshift. Of course the two scenarios can be consistent with each\nother if the first perturbations to collapse are also the most massive at z = 6. This seems to\nbe implied, e.g. in Springel et al. (2005), where the bright quasar candidate in the simulation\nis traced back to one of the 18 collapsed halos at z = 16.7.\nIn this paper we explore the link between the first PopIII halos collapsed in a simulation\nbox and the most massive halos at lower redshifts to gain insight on the scenarios of bright\nquasar formation. This is a numerically challenging problem as the dynamical range of\nmasses involved is very large: a simulation volume of 5 * 108 (Mpc/h)3 has a mass of about\n3.3 * 1019 M\u2299 /h, that is more than 1013 times the mass of a PopIII dark matter halo. We\nhave adopted an original approach to the problem, broadly inspired by the tree method by\nCole et al. (1994). We first simulate at relatively low resolution the evolution of a simulation\nvolume down to z = 0. Then, starting from the density fluctuations field in the initial\nconditions of the numerical simulation, we compute analytically the redshift distribution of\nthe oldest PopIII halo collapsed within each single grid cell. The information is then used\nas input for a Monte Carlo code to sample for each particle of the simulation the collapse\nredshift of the first PopIII progenitor dark matter halo. The formation time of the oldest\nPopIII remnant within the most massive halos identified at z \u2248 6 is finally compared with\nthat of the oldest PopIII star sampled over the whole simulation volume and the implications\nfor the growth of supermassive black holes are discussed.\nOur approach is tuned to investigate the formation and the subsequent remnant distribution of the first, rare density peaks that hosted PopIII stars at z & 30. With this respect\nour study has a similar goal to Reed et al. (2005), with the important difference that we\nsearch for the first PopIII star in the complete simulation box and not by means of progressive refinements around substructures that probe only a small fraction of the total box\nvolume. As our method is tuned at finding very rare fluctuations, it is not easily applied to\nthe significantly more common 3\u03c3 peaks with mass \u2248 106 M\u2299 that collapse at z \u2248 20 and\nthat might constitute the majority of PopIII stars, if these are terminated by chemical feedback at z . 20 (e.g. see, Greif & Bromm 2006) and not by photo-dissociation of molecular\nhydrogen at z & 25 (Haiman et al. 2000).\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we present the details of the numerical\nsimulations carried out. In Sec. 3 we analyze the numerical results focusing on the merging\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nhistory of the first PopIII halos formed in the simulation box. In Sec.4 we review when the\nfirst stars epoch end, while in Sec. 5 we discuss the implications of the PopIII distribution\nthat we find for the build-up of supermassive black hole population at z . 6. We conclude\nin Sec. 6.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nNumerical Methods\nN-body simulations\n\nThe numerical simulations presented in this paper have been carried out using the\npublic version of the PM-Tree code Gadget-2 (Springel 2005). Our standard choice is to\nadopt a cosmology based on the third year WMAP data (Spergel et al. 2006): \u03a9\u039b = 0.74,\n\u03a9m = 0.26, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, where \u03a9m is the total matter density in units of the\ncritical density (\u03c1c = 3H02 /(8\u03c0G)) with H0 being the Hubble constant (parameterized as\nH0 = 100h km/s/Mpc) and G the Newton's gravitational constant (Peebles 1993). \u03a9\u039b is\nthe dark energy density. As for \u03c38 , the root mean squared mass fluctuation in a sphere of\nradius 8Mpc/h extrapolated at z = 0 using linear theory, we consider both \u03c38 = 0.9 and\n\u03c38 = 0.75, focusing in particular on the higher value that provides a better match to the\nobserved clustering properties of galaxies (Evrard et al. 2007).\nThe initial conditions have been generated using a code based on the Grafic algorithm\n(Bertschinger 2001). An initial uniform lattice is perturbed using a discrete realization of\na Gaussian random field sampled in real space and then convolved in Fourier space with a\n\u039bCDM transfer function computed using the fit by Eisenstein & Hu (1999) and assuming\na scale invariant long-wave spectral index (n = 1). The initial density field is saved for\nlater reprocessing through the first light Monte Carlo code (see Sec. 2.2). The particles\nvelocities and displacements are then evolved to the desired starting redshift (zstart = 65.67,\ni.e. astart = 0.015) using the Zel'dovich approximation and the evolution is followed using\nGadget-2 (Springel 2005). Dark matter halos are identified in the simulations snapshots\nusing the HOP halo finder (Eisenstein & Hut 1998).\nTo find the optimal trade-off between mass resolution and box size, both critical parameters to establish a connection between PopIII halos and the most massive halos identified\nat z = 6, we resort to simulations (see Tab. 1) with three different box sizes, all simulated\nwith N = 5123 particles:\n(i) A \"large\" box size of edge 720 Mpc/h that is large enough to contain on average about\none bright high-z quasar. The mass resolution is 3.7 * 1012 M\u2299 /h (corresponding to a\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nhalo of 20 particles).\n(ii) A \"medium\" box size of edge 512 Mpc/h that represents a compromise between a\nslightly higher mass resolution than (i) and a still reasonably large simulation volume.\n(iii) A \"small\" box size of edge 60 Mpc/h. While this box size is too small to host a\nbright z \u2248 6 quasar, its volume is still larger than that of deep surveys like the UDF\n(Beckwith et al. 2006), that spans a volume about 20 times smaller than this box in\nthe redshift interval z \u2208 [5.6 : 6.6] (the typical redshift uncertainty for i-dropouts).\nHalos down to about 3 * 109 M\u2299 /h can be identified in this box. The analysis of the\nresults from this simulation will show the fundamental role played by the large volume\nemployed for simulations (i) and (ii).\n\n2.2.\n\nMonte Carlo code for first light sources\n\nGiven the initial density fluctuations field on the simulation grid, where a cell has a\nmass of order 1010 \u2212 1011 M\u2299 /h, our goal is to estimate the redshift of the first virialized\nperturbation within each cell at the mass scale of early PopIII dark matter halos (i.e. .\n106 M\u2299 , see e.g. Bromm & Larson 2004). For this we resort to an analytical treatment based\non a linear approximation for structure formation.\nThe initial conditions for a N-body simulation in a box of size L with N particles and a\nsingle particle mass mp define a Gaussian random field \u03b4\u03c1 for the N cells (associated to the\nlocation of the N particles) of the simulation grid. This density field is usually generated by\nconvolving white noise with the transfer function associated to the power spectrum of the\ndensity perturbations (e.g., see Bertschinger 2001) and is used to obtain the initial velocity\nand positions displacements for the particles (e.g. see Eq. 5.115 in Peebles 1993). The\ndensity fluctuation in each cell has a contribution from different uncorrelated frequencies in\nthe power spectrum. When the initial conditions for an N-body simulation are generated,\nthe power spectrum has an upper cutoff around the Nyquist frequency for the grid used (i.e.\naround the frequency associated to the average inter-particle distance) and a lower cutoff at\nthe frequency associated to the box size (if periodic boundary conditions are enforced). A\nhigher resolution version of the initial density field can be obtained by simply increasing the\ngrid size and adding the density perturbations associated to the power spectrum between\nthe old and the new cutoff frequencies.\nIn linear approximation one can use the field \u03b4\u03c1 to obtain the redshift of virialization of\na structure of mass Mh > mp at a given position ~x in the grid. To do this one averages the\nfield \u03b4\u03c1 using a spherical window centered at ~x with a radius such that the window encloses\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\na mass Mh and computes assuming linear growth the redshift at which the average density\nwithin the window reaches \u03b4\u03c1 = 1.69 (in units where the average density of the box is 1).\nIn fact, for a spherical collapse model, when \u03b4\u03c1 = 1.69 in linear theory, then the halo has\nreached virial equilibrium under the full non-linear dynamics. This concept is at the base of\nthe various proposed methods for computing analytically the mass function of dark matter\nhalos (e.g., see Press & Schechter 1974; Bond et al. 1991; Sheth & Tormen 1999).\nWe apply this idea to estimate the formation rate and the location in the simulation\nvolume of dark matter halos at a mass scale below the single particle mass used in the\nsimulation. A straightforward implementation consists in generating first the density field\nassociated to the N-body simulation, and then to refine at higher resolution the field by\nmeans of a constrained realization of the initial conditions used in the N-body run (e.g. see\nBertschinger 2001). This provides exact and complete information on the whole density field,\nbut the price to pay is the execution of very large Fast Fourier Transforms on the refined\ngrid. If the goal is to compute density fluctuations down to a mass of \u2248 106 M\u2299 /h over a box\nof edge 720Mpc/h, a grid of 291843 is needed, which would require about 100 TB of RAM,\nthat is well beyond the current memory capabilities of the largest supercomputers.\nA shortcut is however available, if one trades information for numerical complexity.\nGiven a realized numerical simulation, we are in fact not interested in getting a detailed\npicture of the dynamics at sub-grid resolution, but only in identifying for each grid point the\nredshift of virialization of its first progenitor at a given sub-grid mass scale. For example,\ngiven a simulation with single particle mass of 1010 M\u2299 /h our aim is to quantify the redshift\nof virialization of the first dark matter halo of mass 106 M\u2299 /h within the volume associated\nto the 1010 M\u2299 /h particle. In that case, if we were to have the full sub-grid information we\nwould search for the maximum realized value of the density within the 104 sub-grid cells of\nmass 106 M\u2299 /h that constitute our 1010 M\u2299 /h single particle cell. As the density fluctuation\nfield is a Gaussian random field, the density in sub-grid cells will be a Gaussian centered at\nthe density of the parent cell and with variance given by integration of the power spectrum\nof density fluctuations truncated between the Niquist frequency of the parent cell and that\nof the sub-cells.\nTherefore, for a single cell of mass mp , the redshift of collapse of a sub-grid progenitor\nat a mass scale mf s can be obtained simply by sampling from the probability distribution of\nthe maximum of the sub-grid fluctuations of the k = mp /mf s sub-cells of mass mf s that are\nwithin a cell of mass mp . The probability distribution for the maximum of these fluctuations\nis available in analytic form when the field is Gaussian, as in the case considered here. In\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nfact, given a probability distribution p(x), with partition function P (x):\nZ x\nP (x) =\np(a)da,\n\n(1)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nthe probability distribution q(m, k) for the maximum m of k random numbers extracted\nfrom p(x) (m = Max(x1 , ..., xk )) is the derivative of the partition function for m, that in\nturns is simply the k-th power of the partition function for xi , i.e. P (x). Therefore we have:\nq(m, k) = k * p(m) * P (m)k\u22121.\n\n(2)\n\nEq. (2) has a simple interpretation: the probability that the maximum of k random numbers\nlies in the interval [m, m + \u03b4m] is given by the probability of sampling one of the k numbers\nexactly in that interval and all the other numbers below m.\nWith the aid of Eq. (2) we can sample the distribution of the maximum of the additional\nsub-grid density fluctuations that need to be considered in order to probe the mass scale\nof PopIII halos. The variance \u03c3f s to be used in p(x) may be computed from the power\nspectrum of the density fluctuations by considering an upper cut-off at the wavelength of\none cell size in the initial conditions. Or, equivalently, if the complete power spectrum of\ndensity fluctuations has variance \u03c3(Mgrid cell ) at the mass scale of one grid cell and variance\n\u03c3(MP opIII halo ) at the mass scale of a halo hosting a first star, we set \u03c3f s such that:\n\u03c3f2s = \u03c3(MP opIII\n\nhalo )\n\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03c3(Mgrid cell )2 .\n\n(3)\n\nTherefore our recipe for estimating the age of the earliest progenitor formed in each cell\nis the following:\n(i) Starting from the initial density fluctuation field on the grid used to initialize the\nN-body run compute the mass refinement factor k to go from the mass of a single particle (i.e. the mass within one grid cell) to that of a PopIII star halo (k =\nMgrid cell /MP opIII halo ).\n(ii) Given the power spectrum of the density fluctuations, Mgrid cell and MP opIII halo compute \u03c3f s .\n(iii) Extract one random number r from q(m, k) (see Eq. 2) where p(m) is a Gaussian\ndistribution with zero mean and variance \u03c3f s .\n(iv) Sum r to the value of the density field in the cell to obtain (\u03b4\u03c1f s /\u03c1)max in the cell. From\nthe value of (\u03b4\u03c1f s /\u03c1)max it is then straightforward to compute the non-linear redshift\nfor that perturbation, i.e. the redshift znl when the linear density contrast reaches a\nvalue (\u03b4\u03c1f s /\u03c1)max (znl ) = 1.69.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nThe particles of the simulation now carry the additional information of the redshift at\nwhich their first PopIII star dark matter halo progenitor has collapsed in linear theory (a\nproxy for the redshift of actual virialization). Once halos have been identified in simulation\nsnapshots, the redshift of the earliest PopIII progenitor within the halo is easily obtained.\nIt is similarly easy to identify in a snapshot what is the environment in which the particles\nwith the oldest progenitors live. This procedure is robust with respect to variations of\nthe simulation resolution, as long as the focus is on rare density peaks, with an average\noccupation number per simulation cell (i.e. particle) much smaller than unity. Numerical\ntests are presented in Appendix A.\nThis method has two main advantages:\n(i) It allows to use relatively inexpensive \"low resolution\" simulations to identify the\nlargest objects at low redshift (z . 6). In fact if we are interested in identifying\nthe most massive halos at z \u2248 6 as host halos for quasar candidates a mass resolution\nof \u2248 1011 M\u2299 /h is sufficient (e.g. in Springel et al. 2005 the mass of the largest halo at\nz = 6.2 is 3.9 * 1012 M\u2299 /h for a simulation volume of (500Mpc/h)3 ).\n(ii) For a given numerical simulation, several Monte Carlo realization can be generated to\ngather robust statistical constraints on the properties of dark matter halos hosting first\nlight sources as well as the spatial distributions of the first halo remnants in halos at\nlower redshift.\nHowever our method has the drawback that it cannot be easily extended to the investigation of the detailed merging history at the sub-grid level, as only the virialization time\nof the earliest progenitor of each particle at a given mass scale is provided. In addition,\nthe identification of the first virialized PopIII halos is expressed in terms of the halos with\nthe highest znl . We are therefore neglecting the non-linear evolution and the environmental\ndependences on the dynamics of the dark matter collapse, such as tidal forces, therefore\nmissing the precise redshift at which a PopIII halo virializes. These are limitations that we\nneed to accept as the non linear evolution could be followed over the whole box only at the\nprice of running a simulation prohibitively intensive in cpu and memory resources, with at\nleast 103 time more particles than in the Millenium Run (Springel et al. 2005). This appears\nunfeasible for the time being, even considering next generation dedicated supercomputers,\nlike the GrapeDR (Makino 2005).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n3.\n\nThe fate of the first PopIII halos\n3.1.\n\nAnalytical considerations\n\nThe general picture for the connection between first halos and the most massive halos\nat z \u2248 6 can be obtained using analytical considerations, that will be later confirmed in\nSec. 3.2 by the results of our numerical investigation.\nFollowing the choice for our large box simulation, we consider a volume of (720Mpc/h)3\nof mass MBox , large enough to host a bright z \u2248 6 quasar. We estimate from the PressSchechter formalism (see also the masses of the z = 6 halos in our \"large\" box simulation\nin Sec. 3.2) that the most massive halo at z \u2248 6 has a mass (that we call Mqh ) of about\n1012 \u2212 1013 M\u2299 /h (see also Springel et al. 2005). Since the most massive halo is the first at\nits mass scale to be formed, through the use of Eq. 2 we can obtain the distribution of its\ninitial density fluctuation (see Fig. 1). If we assume Mqh = MBox /1803 = 4.3 * 1012 M\u2299 /h\n(in agreement with Springel et al. 2005), this halo is expected to have originated from a\ndensity fluctuation in the range [5 : 5.7]\u03c3(Mqh ) at 90% of confidence level. We now consider\nthe volume initially occupied by the mass Mqh and we compute from the primordial power\nspectrum the variance \u03c3f s of density perturbations at mass scale of a PopIII halo (Mf s =\n106 M\u2299 /h = 1/1603Mqh ) considering only contributions from wavelengths at a scale below\nthe volume enclosed by Mqh (see Eq. 3). We obtain \u03c3f s = 4.85\u03c3(Mqh ). From Eq. 2 follows\nthat the maximum of 1603 Gaussian random numbers with variance \u03c3f s is distributed in the\nrange [23.4 : 27.0]\u03c3(Mqh ) at 90% of confidence level. Combining the two 90% confidence\nlevel intervals, this means that the first PopIII progenitor of a bright quasar originated from\na perturbation in the range [28.4 : 32.7]\u03c3(Mqh ). If we consider instead a random sub-cell\namong the 1603 , the probability that the maximum sub-grid perturbation is smaller than\n32.7\u03c3(Mqh ) is only 0.99995, so several hundreds of the 1803 cells among the whole simulation\nvolume are expected to have a PopIII progenitor formed before that of the most massive\nz = 6 halo. In fact from integration of Eq. 2, the sigma peak associated to the first star\nin the box is expected to be greater than 35.5\u03c3(Mqh ) at 99.99 % of confidence level (and\nin the interval [36.2 : 38.8]\u03c3(Mqh ) at 90% of confidence level). Therefore the rarity of the\nearliest PopIII progenitor of the most massive halo at z = 6 is about 1.5\u03c3f s less than that\nof the first PopIII star formed in the simulation volume. In terms of formation redshift, the\nfirst PopIII star dark matter halo in the simulation volume virializes in the redshift interval\nz \u2208 [49 : 53], while the earliest PopIII progenitor of the QSO halo is formed at z \u2208 [38 : 44]\n(both intervals at 90% of confidence level and computed for \u03c38 = 0.9).\nThe picture changes quite significantly if we consider a smaller box size. E.g. in our\nS1 simulation (see Tab. 1) with a volume of (60Mpc/h)3 a perturbation on a mass scale\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nMqh = 7 * 1011 M\u2299 /h \u2248 MBox /273 is expected to be the most massive at z \u2248 6. Such a\nhalo derives at 90% of confidence level from a fluctuation [3.6 : 4.6]\u03c3(Mqh ). If we further\nassume Mf s = 8.5 * 105 M\u2299 /h = 1/943Mqh , we have a sub-grid variance \u03c3f s = 3.66 so that the\nmaximum of the 943 random first light perturbation in a cell of mass Mqh is distributed in\nthe range [16.4 : 19.4]\u03c3(Mqh ) at 90% of confidence level. By combining the two intervals as\nabove, we expect that the first PopIII progenitor of the most massive z = 6 halo derives from\na [20.0 : 24.0]\u03c3(Mqh ) peak. The first PopIII star derives instead from a [23.8 : 26.1]\u03c3(Mqh )\npeak (always 90% of confidence level). At variance with the larger box, here the correlation\nbetween the most massive halo at z = 6 and the first PopIII star in the simulation is expected\nto be stronger and the most massive halo is likely to have as progenitor one of the first 10-100\nPop III stars.\nFrom these simple analytical estimates it is clear that the most massive and rarest\nstructures collapsed around z \u2248 6 do not descend from the rarest sigma peaks at the first\nlight mass scale in the simulation volume, when the simulation box represents a significant\nfraction of the Hubble volume. Conversely the black holes remnants of the first PopIII\nstars in the universe do not provide the seeds for super-massive black holes within the most\nmassive halos at z . 6. The descendants of first PopIII stars are instead expected to be\nfound at the center of a variety of halos, as we quantify in the next Section by means of\nN-body simulations.\n\n3.2.\n\nSimulations Results\n\nIn constructing the z = 6 halo catalogs we adopt the following parameters for the HOP\nhalo finder (Eisenstein & Hut 1998). The local density around each particle is constructed\nusing a 16 particles smoothing kernel. For the regrouping algorithm we use: \u03b4peak = 240,\n\u03b4saddle = 180, \u03b4outer = 100 and a minimum group size of 20 particles. In the large simulation\nbox (run L1 in Tab 1) we identify 47 halos with 20 particles or more and the most massive\nhalo (37 particles) has a mass of 6.9 * 1012 M\u2299 /h. In the medium simulation box (run M1 in\nTab 1) the higher mass resolution allows us to identify 694 halos with at least 20 particles\nand the most massive halo has 92 particles for a total mass of 6.1 * 1012 M\u2299 /h, consistent\nwith the results from the larger box. Finally in the small box simulations (runs S1 and\nS2 in Tab 1) there are 14972 halos with at least 100 particles in S1 (\u03c38 = 0.9) and 7531\nhalos with at least 100 particles in S2 (\u03c38 = 0.75). The most massive halo has a mass of\n2.4 * 1012 M\u2299 /h in S1 and of 7.1 * 1011 M\u2299 /h in S2. The z = 6 halo mass distribution for these\ntwo simulations is well described (with displacements within \u2248 15%) by a Sheth & Tormen\n(1999) mass function.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nThe link between the halos identified in the snapshots and the first light sources is\nestablished using the Monte Carlo method described in Sec. 2.2. For the large box we\nconsider a refinement factor k = 573 to move from the single particle mass of the simulation\nto a typical PopIII halo mass, so that Mf s = 1.0 * 106 M\u2299 /h. For the first 10 most massive\nhalos at z = 6 we show in Fig. 2 the distribution of the redshift at which the oldest progenitor\ncrosses the virialization density contrast threshold in linear theory (\u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 = 1.69) and the\ndistribution of the ranking of the collapse time computed over all the PopIII progenitors of\nthe simulation particles. The collapse rank of the first PopIII progenitor of the most massive\nz = 6 halo is in the interval [474 : 45075] at 90% of confidence level, with median 8535. The\ncorresponding virialization redshifts are in the interval [39.3 : 44.1] with median 41.1. For\ncomparison the first PopIII halo in the box virializes in the redshift interval [49.0 : 52.7] with\nmedian 50.3; the 100th first light in the box collapses in the redshift range [45.5 : 45.8] with\nmedian 45.7. These results from the combined N-body simulation and Monte Carlo code\nare in excellent quantitative agreement with the analytical estimates of Sec. 3.1 and confirm\nthat in a large simulation box the most massive halos at z = 6 do not derive from the rarest\nsigma peaks at the first light mass scale. This result is robust with respect to the adopted\ntypical mass for PopIII halos. In Fig. 3 we show the results obtained by changing the mass of\nthe halos hosting the first stars considering larger halos (Mf s = 3.4 * 106 M\u2299/h with k = 383 )\nand smaller halos (Mf s = 3.0 * 105 M\u2299/h with k = 853 ). The formation redshift varies as the\nfirst halos are formed earlier when they are less massive, but the relative ranking between\nthe first PopIII halo in the box and the first PopIII progenitor of the most massive structures\nat z = 6 remains similar. In passing we note that our distribution of the formation redshift\nfor the first 3 * 105 M\u2299 progenitor of the most massive z = 6 halo (formed at z \u2248 46) is in\nagreement with the results by Reed et al. (2005), obtained by means of N-body simulations\nwith adaptive refinements. However this halo is not the first one formed in the simulation\nbox as we find that the first structure on this mass scale is formed at z & 55 (see Fig. 3).\nThe results are similar for the medium box, which has a volume that is only three\ntimes smaller than the large one (see Fig. 4). The refinement factor used here is k = 40\nthat gives Mf s = 1.0 * 106 M\u2299 /h. The first PopIII halo in the box virializes in the redshift\nrange [48.3 : 52.4] with median 49.7, while the oldest PopIII progenitor of the most massive\nhalo virializes in the redshift range [38.5 : 43.2] (median 40.4) and has a collapse ranking in\n[574 : 37499] at 90% of confidence level, with median 7261.\nThe picture changes significantly (see Fig. 5) for the small box that has a volume more\nthan 103 times smaller than the large box. Here we use a refinement factor k = 5, that\nleads to Mf s = 8.6 * 105 M\u2299 /h. The collapse rank of the first light progenitor of the most\nmassive z = 6 halo is in the range [1 : 103] at the 90% confidence level with median 13. The\ncorrelation between the first PopIII star and the most massive structure at z = 6 is therefore\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nstrong due to the small volume of the box. This means that locally the oldest remnants of\nfirst stars are expected to be within the largest collapsed structures.\nFrom the medium box size numerical simulation we have also characterized the fraction\nof first PopIII remnants that end up in identified halos at z = 0. If we consider one of\nthe first 100 first light halos collapsed in the box, there is an average probability of 0.72 of\nfinding its remnant in a halo identified at z = 0 with more than 100 particles (that is of\nmass above 6.7 * 1012 M\u2299 /h). The median distribution for the mass of a halo hosting one of\nthe remnants of these first light sources is \u2248 3 * 1013 M\u2299 /h. At 95% of confidence level the\nremnants are hosted by a halo of mass less than 3.6 * 1014 M\u2299 /h. For comparison, the most\nmassive halo in the simulation has a mass of 4.4 * 1016 M\u2299 /h and there are about 15000 halos\nmore massive than 3 * 1012 M\u2299 /h. This is a consequence of the poor correlation between first\nPopIII halos and most massive halos at low redshift.\nFinally, combining the results from all our three simulation boxes, we construct in fig. 6\nthe PopIII star formation rate at high z. The total number of PopIII halos that virialize is\nincreasing with redshift, reaching a number density of \u2248 0.1(Mpc/h)\u22123 at z \u2248 30. In our\nsmall box simulation, this means that the average density of PopIII halos is \u2248 10\u22123 per grid\ncell. Therefore there is a very small probability of having two collapsed halos within the\nsame cell, an event that would not be captured in our model.\n\n4.\n\nWhen does the first stars epoch end?\n\nIn Sec. 3 we show that the most massive halos at z = 6 have first light progenitors\nthat have been formed when already several thousands of other PopIII stars existed. Are\nthese progenitors still entitled to be called first stars? That is, when does the first stars\nepoch end? Here we review the question adopting two different definitions to characterize\nthe transition from the first to the second generation of stars, namely (i) a threshold for\nthe transition given by the destruction of molecular hydrogen and (ii) a metallicity based\nthreshold.\n\n4.1.\n\nMolecular Hydrogen destruction\n\nOne criterion for the end of the first light epoch can be based on the destruction of\nMolecular Hydrogen in the ISM due to photons in the Lyman-Werner ([11.15 : 13.6]eV )\nenergy range emitted by PopIII stars. H2 is in fact needed for cooling of the gas in dark\nmatter halos of mass \u2248 106 (e.g. see Bromm & Larson 2004). The flux in the Lyman-Werner\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nband is about 7.5% of the ionizing flux (i.e. with an energy range above 13.6eV ). A PopIII\nstar is expected to emit a total of about 7.6 * 1061 photons per solar mass (Stiavelli et al.\n2004), so if we assume 300M\u2299 as a typical mass we have about 1.7 * 1063 H2 -destroying\nphotons emitted over the stellar lifetime. Only a fraction \u2248 0.15 of these photons can\neffectively destroy an H2 , molecule, as the most probable outcome of absorption of a Lyman\nWerner photon is a first decay to a highly excited a vibrational level that later returns\nto the fundamental state, with resulting re-emitted photons below the 11.15 eV threshold\n(Shull & Beckwith 1982; Glover & Brand 2001). Therefore we estimate that \u2248 2.5 * 1062 H2\nmolecules will be destroyed by a PopIII star. Given the neutral hydrogen number density\n6.2*1066Mpc\u22123 this means that a PopIII star destroys H2 over a volume 4*10\u22125Mpc3 /\u03be, where\n\u03be is the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen. Assuming a primordial molecular hydrogen\nfraction \u03be \u2248 10\u22126 (e.g. see Peebles 1993), we obtain that a PopIII star has the energy to\ndestroy primordial H2 in a volume of \u2248 14(Mpc/h)3 . This number is in broad agreement\nwith detailed radiative transfer simulations by Johnson, Greif & Bromm (2007). From Fig. 6,\nit is immediate to see that by z \u2248 30 the PopIII number density has reached the critical\nlevel of 0.1(Mpc/h)\u22123 and therefore around that epoch the radiation background destroys\nall the primordial H2 . Once all the primordial H2 has been cleared the universe becomes\ntransparent in the Lyman Werner bands and the new H2 formed during the collapse of gas\nclouds is dissociated by the background radiation. In fact, assuming that the abundance of\nH2 formed during collapse is \u03becoll \u2248 5 * 10\u22124 (e.g. see Haiman et al. 2000), this means that\na collapsing 106 M\u2299 halo produces about 1.3 * 1059 H2 molecules, a negligible number with\nrespect to the 2.5 * 1062 H2 that are destroyed. Our simple estimate therefore suggests that\naround z \u2248 30 the star formation rate of PopIII stars in 106 M\u2299 halos is greatly suppressed\nand proceeds in a self-regulated fashion where only a fraction \u2248 10\u22123 of the collapsing halos\nare actually able to cool and lead to the formation of massive PopIII stars. Eventually\nthe Lyman Werner background is maintained by PopIII stars formed in more massive halos\n(M \u2248 108 M\u2299 ), cooled by atomic hydrogen, and, at later times, by PopII stars.\nInspired by these ideas we set the end of the primordial epoch for PopIII formation at\nthe point where the primordial H2 has been destroyed, that is around z \u2248 30. Of course\nthis is only an order of magnitude estimate and to fully address the feedback due to photodissociating Lyman Werner photons realistic radiative transfer cosmological simulations are\nneeded, which may led even to positive feedback (e.g. see Ricotti et al. 2001). In particular\nour estimate does not take into account the effects of self-shielding and the fact that the\nformation timescale for H2 during the halo collapse may be faster than the timescale for\nphoto-dissociation by the background radiation. Thus it is possible that the PopIII star\nformation rate at z . 30 is not suppressed as much as predicted by our argument. However\nour estimate seems to be in broad agreement with the more realistic model by Haiman et al.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n(2000) that predicts the onset of a significant negative feedback at z & 25, depending on the\nassumed efficiency of Lyman Werner photon production.\n\n4.2.\n\nMetal enrichment\n\nAnother possibility to end the first star epoch is based on a ISM metallicity threshold.\nHowever, in this case a clear transition epoch is missing (e.g. see Scannapieco et al. 2003;\nFurlanetto & Loeb 2005). This is because metal enrichment, driven by stellar winds whose\ntypical velocities are many orders of magnitude lower than the speed of light, is mainly a\nlocal process. Therefore pockets of primordial gas may exists in regions of space that have\nexperienced relatively little star formation, such as voids, even when the average metallicity\nin the universe is above the critical threshold assumed to define the end of the PopIII era.\nIn any case this definition provides a longer duration for the first star era. In fact to\nenrich the local metallicity above the Z = 10\u22124 Z\u2299 threshold, relevant for stopping PopIII\nformation by chemical feedback (see Bromm & Larson 2004), one 300M\u2299 SN must explode\nfor every \u2248 2 * 108M\u2299 total mass volume (DM+barions), assuming on average a PopIII mass\nof 300M\u2299 with yield 0.2. For a Milky Way like halo, this means that about 3000 first stars\nSN are needed to enrich the IGM to the critical metallicity. Accordingly to this definition,\nthe Pop III epoch would end within a significant fraction of the total simulated volume\naround z \u2248 20, when there is the collapse of dark matter halos originated from 3\u03c3 peaks at\nthe 106 M\u2299 mass scale (e.g., see Madau & Rees 2001), if the suppression in the PopIII star\nformation rate due to lack of H2 cooling is neglected. A further caveat is that very massive\nstars may end up directly in Intermediate Mass Black Holes without releasing the produced\nmetals in the IGM (Heger & Woosley 2002; Santos et al. 2002).\n\n5.\n\nGrowth of the PopIII black hole seeds\n\nFrom our investigation it is clear that, before the first PopIII progenitor of the most\nmassive halo at z = 6 is born, several thousands of intermediate mass (mBH \u2248 102 M\u2299 )\nblack hole seeds are planted by PopIII stars formed in a cosmic volume that will on average\nhost a bright z = 6 quasar. This result does not allow to establish an immediate correlation\nbetween the very first PopIII stars created in the universe and the bright z = 6 quasars, but\nneither does it exclude such a link, as the formation epoch for the quasar seed is still at very\nhigh redshift (z & 40), when radiative feedback from other PopIII stars already formed is\nunlikely to affect the formation and evolution of the seed (see Sec. 4.1). Here we investigate\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nwith a simple merger tree code what is the fate of the black holes seeds formed up to the\nformation time of the quasar seed and what are the implications for the observed quasar\nluminosity function.\nWe assume Eddington accretion for the BH seeds, so that the evolution of the BH mass\nis given by:\nmBH = m0 exp [(t \u2212 t0 )/tsal ],\n(4)\nwhere m0 is the mass at formation time t0 and tsal is the Salpeter time (Salpeter 1964):\ntsal =\n\n\u01eb mBH c2\n\u01eb\n= 4.507 * 108 yr\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)LEdd\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u01eb is the radiative efficiency.\nUsing Eq. 5 we can immediately see that a difference of \u2206t . 2*107yr, that is of \u2206z \u2248 10\nat z = 40, in the formation epoch of the BH seed of a bright quasar is not too important in\nterms of the final mass that can be accreted by z = 6, as this corresponds to about half a\nfolding time. Assuming \u01eb = 0.1 until z = 6.4, the highest redshift in the SDSS quasar sample\n(Fan et al. 2004), we obtain a ratio of final to initial mass mBH /m0 = 2.62 * 107 for z = 50\nand mBH /m0 = 1.78 * 107 for z = 40. Therefore in both cases there has been enough time\nto build up a z \u2248 6 supermassive black hole with mass mBH & 109 starting from a PopIII\nremnant.\nThis estimate however highlights that only a minor fraction of the PopIII BH seeds\nformed before z = 40 can accrue mass with high efficiency, otherwise the number density of\nsupermassive black holes at low redshift would greatly exceed the observational constraints.\nThe first BH seeds in the box are distant from each other, so they evolve in relative isolation, without possibly merging among themselves. Therefore other mechanisms must be\nresponsible for quenching accretion of the first BH seeds. Interestingly if we were to assume\nthat accretion periods are Poisson distributed in time for each seed, we would not be able\nto explain the observed power law distribution of BH masses at z . 6 around the high mass\nend. A Poisson distribution would in fact give too little scatter around the median value\nand a sharp (faster than exponential) decay of the displacements from the mean accreted\nmass. An exponential distribution of the accretion efficiency is instead required to match the\nobserved BH mass function. In addition, it is necessary to assume that the duty cycle of the\nBH accretion is roughly proportional to the mass of the halo it resides in. This is sensible,\nsince an accretion model unrelated to the hosting halo mass may lead to the unphysical\nresult of possibly accruing more mass than the total baryon mass available in that halo. In\nfact, a BH seed formed at z \u2248 40 is within a halo of median mass \u2248 1011 M\u2299 /h at z = 6 and\na few percent of the seeds may be in halos with mass below \u2248 109 M\u2299 /h at that redshift.\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nTo explore this possibility we follow the merging history of PopIII halos formed at z = 40\nby means of a merger-tree code based on Lacey & Cole (1993). We implement a BH growth\nbased on Eq. 5, but at each step of the tree we limit the BH mass to mBH \u2264 \u03b7 mbar , where\nmbar is the total baryon mass of the halo that hosts the BH. The results are reported in fig. 7.\nIf the BH growth is not constrained (or only mildly constrained), then a significant fraction\nof the seeds grows above 1010 M\u2299 , which would result in an unrealistic number density of\nsupermassive black holes at z = 6. However, if \u03b7 \u2248 6 * 10\u22123 (like in Yoo & Miralda-Escud\u00e9\n2004; see also Wyithe & Loeb 2003), then we obtain an expected mass for the BH powering\nbright z = 6 quasar of \u2248 5 * 109 M\u2299 , which is in agreement with the observational constraints\nfrom SDSS quasars (Fan et al. 2004). By fitting a power law function to the BH mass\nfunction in the range [0.055 : 0.2] * 1010 M\u2299 we obtain a slope \u03b1 \u2248 \u22122.6, while the slope is\n\u03b1 \u2248 \u22123.7 in the mass range [0.2 : 1.0] * 1010 M\u2299 , a value that is consistent within the 1\u03c3\nerror bar with the slope of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function measured by\nFan et al. (2004).\nAnother contribution to ease an overproduction of bright quasars may be given by the\nsuppression of the early growth of the PopIII BH seeds for the first \u2248 108 yr after formation,\nthat is for about 2tsal (Johnson & Bromm 2007). In fact the radiation from a PopIII star\nmay evacuate most of the gas from its host halo, so that the subsequent BH growth is\nquenched until a merger provides a new gas reservoir to enable growth at near Eddington\nrate (Johnson & Bromm 2007). Also the BH seeds situated in more massive halos would\nprobably be more likely to replentish their gas supply earlier.\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper we investigate the link between the first PopIII halos collapsed in a simulation box and the most massive structures at z \u2248 6, with the aim of establishing the\nrelationship between the first intermediate mass black holes created in the universe and\nthe super-massive black holes that power the emission of bright z = 6 quasars. We show\nthat almost no correlation is present between the sites of formation of the first few hundred\n106 M\u2299 /h halos and the most massive halos at z . 6 when the simulation box has an edge of\nseveral hundred Mpc. Here the PopIII progenitors (halos of mass Mf s \u2248 106 M\u2299 ) of massive\nhalos at z . 6 formed from density peaks that are \u2248 1.5\u03c3(Mf s ) more common than that\nof the first PopIII star in the (512Mpc/h)3 simulation box. These halos virialize around\nznl \u2248 40, to be compared with znl & 48 of the first PopIII halo.\nThis result has important consequences. We show that, if bright quasars and supermassive black holes live in the most massive halos at z \u2248 6, then their progenitors at the\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n106 M\u2299 mass scale are well within the PopIII era, regardless of the PopIII termination mechanism. On the other hand, if the mBH /\u03c3 relationship is already in place at z = 6, then\nbright quasars are not linked to the remnants of the very first intermediate mass black holes\n(IMBHs) born in the universe, as their IMBH progenitors form when already several thousands of PopIII stars have been created within the typical volume that hosts a bright z = 6\nquasar. The IMBH seeds planted by this very first PopIII stars have sufficient time to grow\nup to mBH \u2208 [0.2 : 1] * 1010 M\u2299 by z = 6 if we assume Eddington accretion with radiative\nefficiency \u01eb . 0.1. Instead, quenching of the BH accretion is required for the seeds of those\nPopIII stars that will not end up in massive halos at z = 6, otherwise the number density\nof supermassive black holes would greatly exceed the observational constraints. One way to\nobtain growth consistent with the observations is to limit the accreted mass at a fraction\n\u03b7 \u2248 6 * 10\u22123 of the total baryon halo mass. This gives a slope of the BH mass function\n\u03b1 = \u22123.7 in the BH mass range mBH \u2208 [0.2 : 1] * 1010 M\u2299 , which is within the 1\u03c3 uncertainty\nof the slope of the bright end of the z = 6 quasar luminosity function (\u03b1 \u2248 \u22123.5) measured\nby Fan et al. (2004).\nAnother important point highlighted by this study is that rich clusters do not preferentially host the remnants of the first PopIII stars. In fact the remnants of the first 100\nPop-III stars in our medium sized simulation box (volume of (512Mpc/h)3 ) end up at z = 0\non halos that have a median mass of 3 * 1013 M\u2299 /h. This suggests caution in interpreting the\nresults from studies that select a specific volume of the simulation box, like a rich cluster,\nand then progressively refine smaller and smaller regions with the aim of hunting for the\nfirst lights formed in the whole simulation (see e.g., Reed et al. 2005). Only by considering\nrefinements over the complete volume of the box the rarity and the formation ranking of\nthese progenitors can be correctly evaluated.\nWe thank Mike Santos for sharing his code to generate the initial conditions and for a\nnumber of useful and interesting discussions.

First\nwe compare the maximum overdensity at the first light halo mass scale identified over the\nwhole simulation box using different grid resolutions, including the analytical expectation\nThis preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX macros v5.2.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n(that is equivalent to assume that the whole box is just one cell). The results are reported in\nFig. 8 and confirm indeed that the method is independent of the grid size, with an excellent\nmatch between all the probability distributions computed. The figure has been obtained\nby first generating a Gaussian random field with \u03c3 = 0.1 on a N = 643 grid and adopting\n\u03c3f s = 0.008 and k = 4. Then we progressively bin grid cell values to obtain lower resolution\nversions of the original field. The variance in the low resolution grids scales as (N/643 )1/2\nand the values for \u03c3f s and k are correspondingly increased. As a second test, shown in Fig. 9,\nwe have realized a constrained low resolution (N = 1283 ) version of the initial conditions for\nour S1 simulation and we have then carried out the run down to z = 6. From the snapshot\nat z = 6 we identify the most massive halos in this simulations, verifying that there is a\ngood spatial and mass match with the original 5123 run. The redshift distribution of the\nfirst PopIII progenitor for the most massive halos has been computed using our method and\ncompared with that of the original run. The agreement is very good, especially considering\nthat the dynamics of the dark matter halos has been followed at a resolution 64 times lower.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFirst light, one cell\n\nz=6 QSO, whole box\n\nFig. 1.- Probability distribution functions p(m) for the maximum m of k random Gaussian\nfluctuations representative of mass scale for halos hosting z = 6 QSO candidates (red curve)\nand PopIII stars (black curve).
