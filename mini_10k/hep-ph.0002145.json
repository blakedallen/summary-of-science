Because q can be also interpreted as the so called nonextensivity parameter occuring in some applications\nof Tsallis statistic [1], it would be interesting to check if such interpretation can be\nextended to the q < 1 case as well. We shall demonstrate below that this is indeed\nthe case [3].\n\n2\n\n\fThe essential difference between these two cases is, for the purpose of present\ndiscussion, that whereas for q > 1 probability distribution Lq (\u03b5) is well defined\nfor the whole range of variable \u03b5, \u03b5 \u2208 (0, \u221e), for q < 1 it is defined only for\n\u03b5 \u2208 [0, \u03c70 /(1 \u2212q)]. As it was done in [2] we shall deduce the form of function f (1/\u03c7),\ndescribing fluctuations in \u03c7, which would lead from the exponential distribution Lq=1\nto the power-like L\u00e9vy distribution Lq<1\nLq<1 (\u03b5; \u03c70 ) = Cq\n\n\"\n\n\u03b5\n1\u2212 \u2032\n\u03b1 \u03c70\n\n(for simplicity we denote \u03b1\u2032 =\nfunction we have\n\"\n\n\u03b5\n1\u2212 \u2032\n\u03b1 \u03c70\n\n#\u03b1\u2032\n\n=\n\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c70\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c70 \u2212 \u03b5\n\n#\u03b1\u2032\n\n1\n).\n1\u2212q\n\n!\u2212\u03b1\u2032\n\n= Cq\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u03b5\nexp \u2212\n\u03c7\n\n!\n\nf\n\n1\n\u03c7\n\n!\n\n1\nd\n\u03c7\n\n!\n\n(6)\n\nFrom the representation of the Euler gamma\n\n1\n=\n\u0393(\u03b1\u2032 )\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nd\u03b7 \u03b7\n\n\u03b1\u2032 \u22121\n\n\"\n\nexp \u2212\u03b7\n\n0\n\n1+\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c70 \u2212 \u03b5\n\n!#\n\n.\n\n(7)\n0 \u2212\u03b5\nChanging now variables under the integral in such a way that \u03c7 =\none\n\u03b7\nimmediately obtains Eq.

This time, contrary to the q > 1 case of\n[2], fluctuations depend on the value of the variable in question, i.e., the mean value\nand variance are both \u03b5-dependent:\n* +\n\n1\n\u03c7\n\n1\n=\n\u03c70 \u2212\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n*\n\nand\n\n1\n\u03c7\n\n!2 +\n\nHowever, the relative variance\n\n\u03c9 =\n\n\u001c\u0010 \u0011 \u001d\n2\n1\n\u03c7\n\n\u2212\n\nD E2\n1\n\u03c7\n\nD E2\n1\n\u03c7\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n* +2\n\n1\n\u03c7\n\n=\n\n1\n1\n*\n\u0010\n\u03b1\u2032 \u03c7 \u2212\n0\n\n1\n= 1\u2212q\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b1\u2032\n\n\u00112 .\n\n(9)\n\n(10)\n\nremains \u03b5-independent (exactly like in the case of q > 1) and depends only on\nparameter q. It means therefore that the parameter q in L\u00e9vy distribution Lq (\u03b5)\ndescribes the relative variance of fluctuations of parameter \u03c7 in Lq=1 (\u03b5) for all values\nof q (both for q > 1, where \u03c9 = q \u2212 1, cf. [2] and for q < 1 as given above, where\n\u03c9 = 1 \u2212 q).\nIn [2] we have proposed a general explanation of the meaning of function f (\u03c7)\ndescribing fluctuations of some variable \u03c7. The question one is interested in is\n3\n\n\fwhy, and under what circumstances, it is the gamma distribution that describes\nfluctuations. To this end we have started with general Langevin type equation [4]\nfor the variable \u03c7\nd\u03c7\n1\n+\n+ \u03be(t) \u03c7 = \u03c6 = const > 0\ndt\n\u03c4\n\u0014\n\n\u0015\n\n(11)\n\n(with damping constant \u03c4 and source term \u03c6). For stochastic processes defined\nby the white gaussian noise form of \u03be(t) (cf. [2] for details) it can be shown that\ndistribution function for the variable \u03c7 satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation (K1,2\nare the corresponding intensity coefficients, cf. [2])\ndf (\u03c7)\n\u2202\n1 \u22022\n= \u2212\nK1 f (\u03c7) +\nK2 f (\u03c7),\ndt\n\u2202\u03c7\n2 \u2202\u03c72\n\n(12)\n\ni.e., it is indeed given by the Gamma distribution in variable 1/\u03c7 of the form (2)\nwith \u03bc = \u03b1\u03c70 . Notice that it differs from Eq. (8) only in the form of parameter \u03bc,\nwhich in (8) depends also on the physical quantity of interest \u03b5.\nAs an illustration of the genesis of Eq. (11) we have discussed in [2] the case of\nfluctuations of temperature (i.e., the situation where \u03c7 = T ) [5]. Suppose that we\nhave a thermodynamic system, in a small (mentally separated) part of which the\ntemperature fluctuates around some mean value T0 (which can be also understood\nas an equilibrium temperature) with \u2206T \u223c T . The unevitable exchange of heat\nbetween this selected region and the rest of the system is described by Eq. (11) in\nwhich\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03b5\nT0\n1\nT0 \u2212 \u2032\nwhereas\n\u03c6 = \u03c6q>1 = .\n(13)\n\u03c6 = \u03c6q<1 =\n\u03c4\n\u03b1\n\u03c4\nIt means that the corresponding process of heat conductivity is, for q < 1 case,\ndescribed by the following equation (here T \u2032 = T0 \u2212 \u03c4 \u03be(t)T )\n1\n\u03b5\n\u2202T\n\u2212 (T \u2032 \u2212 T ) +\n= 0,\n\u2202t\n\u03c4\n\u03c4 \u03b1\u2032\n\n(14)\n\nwhich differs from the corresponding equation for q > 1 case only by the last term\ndescribing the presence the internal heat source. It has a sense of dissipative transfer\nof energy from the region where (due to fluctuation) we have higher T . It could be\nany kind of convection type flow of energy, for example it could be connected with\nemission of particles from that region. The heat release given by \u03b5/(\u03c4 \u03b1\u2032 ) depends\non \u03b5 (but it is only a part of \u03b5, which is released). In the case of such energy release (connected with emission of particles) there is additionale cooling of the whole\nsystem. If this process is sufficiently fast, it could happen that there is no way to\nreach a stationary distribution of temperature (because the transfer of the heat from\n4\n\n\fthe outside can be not sufficient for development of the state of equilibrium). On\nthe other hand (albeit this is not our case here) for the reverse process we could\nface the \"heat explosion\" situation (which could happen if the velocity of the exotermic burning reaction grows sufficiently fast; in this case because of nonexistence\nof stationary distribution we have fast nonstationary heating of the substance and\nacceleration of the respective reaction).\nIt should ne noticed that in the case of q < 1 the temperature does not reach\nstationary state because, cf. Eq. (9), h1/T i = 1/(T0 \u2212 \u03b5/\u03b1\u2032), whereas for q > 1 we\nhad < T >= T0 . As a consequence the corresponding L\u00e9vy distribution are defined\nonly for \u03b5 \u2208 (0, T0 \u03b1\u2032 ) because for \u03b5 \u2192 T0 \u03b1\u2032 the < T >\u2192 0. Such asymptotic (i.e.,\nfor t/\u03c4 \u2192 \u221e) cooling of the system (T \u2192 0) can be also deduced form Eq. (14) for\n\u03b5 \u2192 T0 \u03b1\u2032 .\nTo summarize, we have demonstrated that temperature fluctuations lead to the\nL\u00e9vy distribution Lq (\u03b5) with index q < 1 when there exists energy source and with\nq > 1 in the absence of such source. In both cases, however, the relative variance of\n1/T fluctuations is described by the parameter q only.\n\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C.Tsallis, J.Stat.Phys. 52 (1988) 479; for updated bibliography on this subject cf. http://tsallis.cat.cbpf.br/biblio.htm.
