Introduction\nThe topic of electromagnetic cloaking at optical and microwave frequencies has\nreceived much attention since the proposed concept of transformation optics by\nPendry et al [1] and Leonhardt [2]. It was suggested that invisibility cloaking can in\nprinciple be achieved with metamaterials. Schurig et al [3] realized an invisibility\ncloak experimentally by a core-shell structure and demonstrated the cloaking\nmechanism in the range of microwave frequencies. Along the similar lines, the spatial\ncoordinate transformations of Maxwell's equation can facilitate the design of a variety\nof structures with unique electromagnetic or optical functions. Rahm et al [4]\ndesigned a square electromagnetic cloak and an omni-directional electromagnetic\nfield concentrator. In fact, a partially resonant mechanism between the induced\ndipoles and quadrupoles of particles for quasi-static cloaking has been achieved in a\nregion external to the cloaking body by Nicorovici et al [5, 6] and Milton et al [7].\nSubsequently, the method was extended by Cui et al [8], Boardman et al [9] and Alu\net al [10] to various different cases. Although the experimental realization of cloaking\nhas been imperfect up to now, the concept of a form-invariant coordinate\ntransformation has been applied to variety of electromagnetic, acoustic and\nelasto-mechanical structures [11-17]. For instance, cloaking in acoustic wave has been\nobserved through the form-invariant acoustic equation [17]. From the above work, it\nis worthwhile constructing a material whose materials properties can vary gradually in\nspace. We shall call this material the graded metamaterial. Based on graded core-shell\nmetamaterials, it is possible to hide an object from the outside world through altering\n\n2\n\n\fthe flow of light in a graded metamaterial shell. Recently, graded metamaterials for\ncloaking purpose were designed in terms of spectral representation [18] together with\ncontrolling the electric field in cylindrical geometry [19].\nMotivated by the above work, we consider the problem of controlling electric\nfield distribution in the case of graded cylindrical core-shell metamaterials. The\nextension of different graded metamaterial models is related to a few theoretical\nmethods for discussing the effective response and analytical solutions of general\ngraded materials, such as using the special function [20-24], the transformation field\nmethod [25] and the differential effective dipole approximation [26-28]. In this paper,\nwith an applied optical field, we consider a coated cylindrical structure, which\nconsists of a homogeneous dielectric core, a shell of graded metamaterial having a\ncomplex\n\npermittivity\n\ngiven\n\nby\n\nthe\n\ngraded\n\nDrude\n\nmodel\n\n[18,29]\n\n\u03b5 s (r , \u03c9 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2p (r ) / \u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u0393) , where \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the external\noptical electric field, \u03c9 p (r ) ( \u0393 ) is the spatially varying plasmon frequency\n(relaxation rate), and r is the radial variable in cylindrical coordinates. For a\npower-law profile of plasmon frequency \u03c9 p (r ) , the potential and electric field\ndistributions can be solved analytically in terms of the hyper-geometric functions. Our\nresults show that the electric field can be controlled by varying the model parameters.\nSuch a control can be achieved by the graded metamaterials at optical or microwave\nfrequencies.\nIn Sec II, we will establish the general formalism of a graded cylindrical core-shell\nstructure in the quasi-static limit when the optical electric field is applied along the\n\n3\n\n\fx -direction, and obtain the equivalent permittivity of such structure. Furthermore, the\nanalytical potentials are obtained for a power-law profile in a graded Drude model. In\nSec.III, based on the analytical solutions, we have numerically investigated how the\ngraded parameters can spatially control the electric field distribution and determine\nthe position of the peak of the field distribution within the two-dimensional core-shell\nstructure. A conclusion will be given in Sec. IV.\n\nII. Solutions of a graded cylindrical core-shell structure\nWe suppose the complex permittivity of an isotropic cylindrical medium is a\nfunction of its spatial variables, i.e. \u03b5 \u03b1 (r ) depends on the radial variable r in\ncylindrical coordinates ( r , \u03c6 , z ), and the subscript \u03b1 = c, s, h notes the core, shell and\nisotropic host regions, respectively. Note that the coated cylinder has a core of inner\nradius a and a shell of outer radius b . The Maxwell's equations \u2207 \u22c5 D = 0 and\n\n\u2207 \u00d7 E = 0 give the following field equation in the quasi-static limit,\n\u2207 \u22c5 [\u03b5 \u03b1 (r )\u2207\u03a6\u03b1 ] = 0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6\u03b1 notes the potential of \u03b1 -type medium and the local electric\nfield E\u03b1 = \u2212\u2207\u03a6\u03b1 . For an infinitely long cylinder structure, Eq.(1) can be reduced to\nthe following equation when an external uniform electric field E 0 is applied along\nthe x -direction,\n\n\u2202\u03a6 \u03b1\n\u2202\u03a6\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202\n[\u03b5 \u03b1 ( r ) r\n]+\n[\u03b5 \u03b1 (r ) \u03b1 ] = 0 .\nr \u2202r\n\u2202r\nr \u2202\u03c6\nr\u2202\u03c6\n\n(2)\n\nWith Eq.(2), the potentials of the homogeneous core and host regions, i.e. constants\n4\n\n\f\u03b5 c and \u03b5 h , take the following forms, respectively,\n\u03a6 c (r , \u03c6 ) = ArE0 cos(\u03c6 ) ,\n\nr\u2264a\n\n(3)\n\n\u03a6 h (r , \u03c6 ) = ( \u2212 r + b 2 Br \u22121 ) E 0 cos(\u03c6 ) .\n\nr >b\n\nFor the graded cylindrical shell, the potential\n\n(4)\n\u03a6 s can be expressed\n\n\u221e\n\nas \u03a6 s (r , \u03c6 ) = \u2211 Rm (r ) cos(m\u03c6 ) , where Rm (r ) is the radial function. Substituting the\nm =0\n\nshell potential into Eq.(2), we obtain the equation for the radial function Rm (r ) ,\n\u2202R (r ) m 2\n1 \u2202\n[\u03b5 s (r )r m ] \u2212\n[\u03b5 s (r ) Rm (r )] = 0 ,\nr \u2202r\n\u2202r\nr2\n\na < r \u2264 b.\n\n(5)\n\n+ (r ) and R \u2212 (r ) that are regular at origin\nFor Eq.(5), there exist two solutions Rm\nm\n\nr = 0 and infinity r \u2192 \u221e , respectively. Then the general solution of the radial\n+\n\u2212\nfunction is given by Rm ( r ) = Am Rm\n( r ) + Bm R m\n( r ) .

Note that\n\n(11)\n\nF (b) is the equivalent permittivity of the graded cylindrical shell structure and\n\nformally dependent on the detailed graded profiles, and B the equivalent dipole\nfactor of the system.\nNext, we will consider a radially inhomogeneous permittivity profile given by\ngraded Drude model \u03b5 s (r , \u03c9 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2p (r ) / \u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u0393) , where \u03c9 2p (r ) = \u03c9 2p (0)(1 \u2212 hr k ) ,\nand derive the analytic solutions of the graded cylindrical shell region so that a better\ncontrol of local electric field is discussed. To simply the calculation and without loss\nof generality, we further normalize the field frequencies \u03c9 and the relaxation rate\n\u0393 with \u03c9 p (0) (or let \u03c9 p (0) = 1 ). The normalized Drude model is thus rewritten as\n\n\u03b5 s (r ) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 hr k ) / \u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u0393) .\n\n(12)\n\nTo obtain the analytical solution of the potential of the graded cylindrical shell\nwith gradient profile Eq.(12), we introduce a transformation, namely, R1 (r ) = r s g ( z ) ,\nwhere z = hr k /(\u03c9 2 + i\u03c9\u0393 \u2212 1) , into Eq.(5).

Note that we\ncan demonstrate that the hyper-geometric functions F (\u03b1 +1 , \u03b2 +1 , \u03b3 +1 , z ) for s = 1\nand F (\u03b1 \u22121 , \u03b2 \u22121 , \u03b3 \u22121 , z ) for s = \u22121 are linear independent and construct the\ngeneral solution of Eq.(14), where \u03b3 \u00b11 = \u00b12 / k + 1 , \u03b2 \u00b11 =\n\n1\u00b1 2 / k + 1+ 4 / k 2\n,\n2\n\n1\u00b1 2 / k \u2212 1+ 4 / k 2\n\u03b1 \u00b11 =\n. Thus, in graded cylindrical shell region, we obtain two\n2\nsolutions R1+ (r ) and R1\u2212 (r ) , which are again regular at origin point r = 0 and\ninfinity r \u2192 \u221e , respectively,\nR1+ (r ) = rF (\u03b1 +1 , \u03b2 +1 , \u03b3 +1 , hr k / d ) ,\n\n(15)\n\nR1\u2212 (r ) = r \u22121F (\u03b1 \u22121 , \u03b2 \u22121 , \u03b3 \u22121 , hr k / d ) ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere d = \u03c9 2 + i\u03c9\u0393 \u2212 1 . Therefore, considering the Eq.(15) and (16) and the\ncoefficients of Eqs.(3), (4) and (6) , we have analytically derived the potential\nsolutions of graded cylindrical shell system with a graded Drude model. These\nsolutions can be used to analyze the local electric field distribution.\n\n7\n\n\fIII. Numerical results\nIn order to investigate the local electric field controlled by the model parameters,\nwe first obtain the electric field formulas in the whole system from above analytical\npotentials. With electric field formula E\u03b1 = \u2212\u2207\u03a6\u03b1 , the moduli E h and E s of the\nlocal electric fields in the host and shell regions are derived, respectively,\n\nE h = E0 [1 + (b / r ) 4 B 2 + 2 B(b / r ) 2 cos(2\u03c6 )]1 / 2 ,\n\n(17)\n\nE s = E0 [(\u2202R1 (r ) / \u2202r ) 2 cos 2 (\u03c6 ) + R12 (r )r \u2212 2 sin 2 (\u03c6 )]1 / 2 ,\n\n(18)\n\nwhere R1 (r ) = A1R1+ (r ) + B1R1\u2212 (r ) . Note that the electric field modulus in an\ninclusion core region is a constant Ec = AE0 .\nWith above formulas, the modulus E of the corresponding local electric field is\ncalculated and shown in Fig.1, where the spatial distributions of electric field in the\ncoated cylindrical system ( 0 \u2264 r \u2264 1.2 ) are dependent on the reduced frequency\n\n\u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) (external electric field E 0 is along x -direction and let E0 = 1 ). It is clearly\nseen that the electric field can be concentrated at a specific position in the shell\nregions by varying the reduced frequency \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) . The annular regions of large\nintensity (brighter regions) surround the core and are symmetrical about the y - axis.\nMeanwhile, the brighter region shrinks towards the core as the frequency\nparameter \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) increases. This indicates that controlling and concentrating the\nelectric field is possible by using the core-shell graded metamaterials, where the\nsimilar result was obtained for a solid cylindrical inclusion in Ref. [19]. To further\nexamine the electric field distribution in Fig.1, we calculate the electric field along\nthe x -axis (i.e. \u03c6 = 0 ) for different reduced frequency parameters \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) in Fig.2. It\n8\n\n\fcan be easily found that, when the frequency parameter increases, the peak position of\nthe electric field modulus shifts toward the core region. Similar to the case of the\nreduced frequency parameter \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) , the effects of the graded parameter k on the\nelectric field are also shown in Fig.3. This can be understood from the fact that the\ngraded Drude model given by Eq.(12) has a decreasing plasmon resonant frequency\nfrom r = a to r = b ( 0 \u2264 a < b \u2264 1 ) with parameters \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) and k increase. In\naddition, for a given threshold value of electric field modulus, the radial region,\nwhose corresponding electric field value is larger than the threshold value, shrinks\nwhen the reduced frequency parameter increases. This intuitively explains why the\nbrightness and its corresponding region decrease with increasing the reduced\nfrequency \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (0) in Fig.1.\nTo discuss the influence of the plasmon frequency parameter h on the local\nelectric field distribution, the numerical calculation is taken for various parameter h\nranging from 0.1 to 0.9 in Fig.4. Our results show that there is a relatively broad field\ndistribution over the graded metal-shell space for frequency parameter h ranging\nfrom 0.34 to 0.4 (similar to the curve h =0.4 in Fig.4) and a broad but weaken field\ndistribution for parameter h ranging from 0.1 to 0.3, like the curve h =0.5 in Fig.4.\nThis is possibly caused by the surface plasmon resonance band of graded\nmetamaterials leading a broad field distribution [31]. For our example, the frequency\nparameter h (ranging from 0.34 to 0.4) results in a stronger field distribution over\nthe whole graded shell region comparing with other values of parameter h . For the\nfrequency parameter h = 0.7 , 0.8, 0.9, there clearly exists a peak of local electric field\n\n9\n\n\fas shown in Fig.4. It implies that the electric field can also be controlled by the\nparameter h and its peak-value of the electric field distribution shifts toward the\ncore due to the Drude model with increasing parameter h .\nIn order to determine the peak's spatial position of electric field distribution in\ncylindrical shell, we have investigated the frequency resonant condition\n\n\u03c9 / \u03c9 p (r ) = 1 of the external optical field frequency \u03c9 and graded plasmon\nfrequency \u03c9 p (r ) of metamaterial shell. Because the plasmon frequency \u03c9 p (r )\nvaries spatially, there exists a spatial region of continuous plasmon resonance in the\nmetamaterial shell. If the external field frequency equals a plasmon frequency of\nmetamaterial shell in a spatial point r , resonance occurs and induces a strong field in\nthis spatial position. Thus, the local electric field peak's position can be exactly\npredicted by the frequency resonant condition \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (r ) = 1 . In Fig.5, we have given\nthe exact peak's position predicted by the formula \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (r ) = 1 and compared with\nthe numerical results obtained from Figs. 2, 3 and 4. Excellent agreement is obtained\nand the peak's position can indeed be determined exactly. In addition, if \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (r ) < 1\n(or \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (r ) > 1 ) in the whole metamaterial shell region, it implies that the shell is\nthe metallic-like material (or dielectric-like material ), and will induce a broad\ndistribution of local electric field (for the case of metallic-like material, see Fig.4\nfor h = 0.4 , 0.5) due to the salient properties of graded metamaterials [29].\n\nIV. Conclusions\nIn summary, the control of the electric field by graded meatmaterials has been\n\n10\n\n\finvestigated. With a graded Drude model, the potentials and electric fields are\nanalytically derived by means of hyper-geometric function for a graded core-shell\ncylindrical structure. Our results show that the electric field distribution can be\ncontrolled by tuning the frequency, the plasmon frequency and graded parameters.\nOne can further confine the field peak position in the shell region by using the surface\nplasmon resonant condition \u03c9 / \u03c9 p (r ) = 1 . The precise and flexible positioning of the\nenhanced field may have many applications in optical design, for example, in\ndisplaying and printing technologies. Furthermore, it is also instructive to extend our\nmethod to the three-dimensional spherical core-shell system for various graded profile\nby using established analytical solutions of graded spherical composites [20-23], the\ndifferential effective dipole approximation [26-28] and the transformation field\nmethod for complex structures [25].\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the NSFC (Grant No. 40876094), National 863 Project of China\n(Grant No. 2008AA09A403) and the RGC General Research Fund of the Hong Kong SAR\nGovernment.\n\nReferences\n[1] J.
