The nuclear equation of state is very\nsimilar to that of non-ideal gases, which allows\nto foresee the existence of different phases of nuclear matter. But can one define phase transitions in \"small\" objects, when the dimension is\nof the same order of magnitude as the range of\nthe force which binds them? In this sense nuclei as well as clusters of galaxies are small. Recent works state that statistical mechanics based\non the Boltzmann' definition of entropy (S =\n\u2217\n\ne-mail:rivet@ipno.in2p3.fr\nPermanent address: Laboratorio Nazionale del Sud, Via\nS. Sofia 44, I-95123 Catania, Italy.\n\u2021\ndeceased\n\u2020\n\nk. log W ) allows to define phase transitions in\nsmall systems [1]. The nucleus at zero or moderate temperature, because of its quantal nature,\nis assimilated to a liquid phase. A nuclear gas\nphase was characterized, for instance, through\nthe properties of vaporised quasi-projectiles from\n95 AMeV Ar+Ni reactions, fully predicted by\nmodelling a van der Waals gas of fermions and\nbosons in thermodynamic equilibrium [2]. The\nliquid-gas coexistence region was thus naturally\nconnected to multifragmentation, break-up of a\nnuclear system in several fragments of various\nsizes.\nMost of the works on nucleus phase transition\nrelied on static properties such as the charge (or\nmass) partitions measured in nuclear reactions.\nThe observation of a power law on a limited\nrange of fragment charge measured in inclusive\nexperiments was claimed to be consistent with a\ncritical behaviour, according to Fisher's droplet\n\n\fmodel [3], and also to percolation models [4].\nRecent and well selected data from the ISIS collaboration were analysed in this framework, and\na liquid-gas coexistence curve was derived [5, 6].\nIn the same line, critical exponents were reported\nto have measured values in agreement with those\nof a liquid-gas model [7, 8].\nCaloric curves relate the energy and the temperature of nuclei. The observation of caloric curves\nshowing a bending or a plateau, similar to what\nis observed for the boiling of water, was claimed\nas a proof of the nuclear phase transition [9].\nA new signal of phase transition of nuclei was\nfound in the observation of a negative branch of\nthe microcanonical heat capacity for Au quasiprojectiles excited between 3 and 6 AMeV [10].\nThis paper presents a compilation of the results which deal with central collisions between\nheavy ions (Aproj + Atgt > 200), obtained so far\nin the INDRA collaboration. Most of them will\nbe detailed in other contributions to this conference. Different signals which may be connected\nwith the occurrence of a phase transition in nuclei\nwere found, each of them bringing a small stone\nto the construction of a consistent framework.\n\n2.\n\nPHASE TRANSITION: DYNAMICS AND\nTHERMODYNAMICS\n2.1.\n\nThermodynamics aspect\n\nAs exemplified in fig. 1, where isotherms are\ndrawn in a pressure-density plane, the EOS of\nnuclear matter resembles that of a van der Waals\ngas. A region of negative incompressibility, bordered by the spinodal line, and located inside the\ncoexistence region, appears in this diagram. This\nspinodal region is a zone of mechanical instability, where an increase of pressure leads to an\nexpansion of the system; on entering this zone\nthe system will tend to recover thermodynamical equilibrium by separating into two coexisting\nphases, a low-density (gas) phase and a higher\ndensity (liquid) phase. Note that the time for the\nsystem to go from homogeneity to inhomogeneity is finite, in other words a phase transition has a\ndynamics (see next subsection). The spinodal region is also thermally unstable, as the heat capacity, c = dE/dT , is negative inside this zone.

The dashed-dotted line is\nthe coexistence line and the dotted line the spinodal line.\n\ncording to this formula, it seems easy to evidence\na negative heat capacity, which should appear, in\na microcanonical frame, as a backbending of the\ncaloric curve. It is not so simple in the case of\nnuclei, as their temperature, energy, density can\nonly be modified by a more or less violent nuclear\ncollision; one is dealing with isolated systems\nwithout external constraints, which eventually induce a phase transition in the course of their evolution in a (temperature, pressure, energy) space.\nThe followed path is not known and there is no\na priori reason why the resulting caloric curve\nwould have a plateau, or a backbending [11].\nAnother and more robust signal was proposed\nto recognise a phase transition, abnormally large\nfluctuations of the kinetic part, Ek of the energy\n(E = Ek +Epot ) [12]. In this case the heat capacity can be expressed as ctot = c2k /(ck \u2212 A\u03c3k2 /T 2 ),\nwith ck = dhEk i/dT . When the normalised fluctuations exceed the canonical value ck , the heat\ncapacity becomes negative, as depicted in fig. 2.\nThese variables may be determined in an experiment, provided that one can reconstruct the partition present at the \"freeze-out\" stage, defined as\nthe instant when nuclear interaction between the\npresent species vanishes.\nFinally this static statistical physics approach\nsupposes that the ensemble of collisions considered constitutes a statistical ensemble.

Statistical physics concepts can be\nsafely used providing that there is adequacy between the ensemble treated and the applied formalism [13].\n2.2.\n\nDynamics of the phase transition\n\nIs it possible to explore the fugitive dynamics\nof the nuclear phase transition? A positive answer was recently given in the INDRA collaboration. Heavy nuclear systems were produced\nat the same energy (\u223c 7 AMeV), but with very\ndifferent total masses (393 and 248), through\ncentral collisions between 36 AMeV Gd and U\nand 32 AMeV Xe and Sn; the resulting measured charge distributions superimposed while\nthe fragment multiplicities scaled as the total system masses [14]. While this indicates the dominance of phase space effects, with stochastic fragment production governed by a Boltzmann factor, it may also sign the presence of bulk instabilities inducing density fluctuations, and finally\nleading to the spinodal decomposition of the nuclear system. And indeed spinodal decomposition is, together with nucleation, one of the processes describing the dynamics of the liquid-gas\nphase transition in nuclear matter [15]. The most\n\nunstable mode(s) in the system induce homogeneous density fluctuations which will be amplified by the mean field with a characteristic\ntime which decreases with the temperature of the\nsystem. Locally zones close to normal density\nmay appear, leading to the formation of fragments whose radii and relative distances depend\non the wavelength of the mode, as schematized\nin fig. 3. In this scenario, one expects a narrow\nfragment charge distribution, loosely dependent\non the total charge of the system provided it is\nlarge enough. In finite size hot nuclear systems\nseveral modes are equally probable, may beat, all\neffects which blur the initial picture and lead to\nmuch broader charge distributions. This is exdM/dZ\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n32 AMeV Xe+Sn\n36 AMeV Gd+U\n\n0.08\n0.06\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n0\n\n10 20 30 40 50\nZ\n\nFig. 4: Charge distributions from central heavy ion collisions. The lines show the results of stochastic mean field\nsimulations while the symbols display the experimental results. Adapted from [17].\n\nemplified in fig. 4, where the lines display the\n\n\f4\ncharge distributions obtained through a complete\nstochastic mean field simulation of central nuclear collisions between heavy ions, the Brownian one-body dynamics (Bob): the mean field\nis complemented by a Brownian force in the kinetic equations, which mimic a stochastic collision term. For the two reactions considered here,\n36 AMeV Gd+ U, and 32 AMeV Xe+Sn, the\nsystem is driven into the spinodal region, where\nit multifragments through spinodal decomposition [18]. The de-excitation of the hot fragments\nso formed is followed simultaneously with their\npropagation in their Coulomb field. Finally the\nsimulated events (Bob events) are passed through\na software replica of the INDRA detector. Obviously the final distributions (lines in fig. 4) are\nfar from narrow, being continuously decreasing\nwith increasing Z without any visible peak. But\nthey perfectly reproduce the experimental distributions measured in the two systems quoted\nabove (symbols in fig. 4), particularly the independence of the charge distribution against the\nmass of the system is recovered [17]. It is worthwhile to mention that kinetic properties of the\noutgoing channel are also well accounted for,\nparticularly the fragment-fragment velocity correlations [19].\nThese simulations show that the phase transition, or the spinodal decomposition process can\nnot be evidenced by a single variable like a\ncharge distribution. It might however well be\nthat a few events kept a memory of the process, through a preferred break-up in equal-sized\nfragments. The charge correlation function defined as: C = Ycor (Zav , \u03c3Z )/Yuncor (Zav , \u03c3Z ) is\nvery efficient to enlighten any extra production\nof rare event types [20], as it makes use of the\nfull per-event information through two variables,\nthe average charge Zav and the standard deviation \u03c3Z . Equal-sized fragment partitions (small\n\u03c3Z ), were looked for in Bob events from 32\nAMeV Xe+Sn central collisions. The variable\nZav was replaced by Mf \u00d7 Zav as events with\ndifferent fragment multiplicities Mf were mixed\nto improve statistics [21]. The uncorrelated yield,\nYuncor (Zav , \u03c3Z ), obtained in ref [20, 21] by making pseudo-events from fragments belonging to\ndifferent events of the same sample, may also\nbe analytically calculated from the charge dis-\n\ntribution [22], in order to make its statistical error negligible everywhere. The correlation function shown in fig. 5 (left) uses the analytical\nYuncor and the\ndeviation of the meaPstandard\nMf\nsure: \u03c3Z = ( i=1 (Zi \u2212 Zav )2 /Mf )1/2 , at variance with ref [20, 21], The general trend is a decrease of the correlation function with decreasing\n\u03c3Z , as expected from the broad charge distribution, except in the smaller bin, \u03c3Z < 1, where it\nincreases again. For 36 < Mf \u00d7 Zav < 60 this\nincrease is statistically significant, with a confidence level larger than 98%. But only 0.6%\nof the events contribute to these enhanced partitions, while all simulated events multifragment\nthrough spinodal decomposition. Due to this\nsmall number one may wonder about the real\nmeaning of these peaks at small \u03c3Z , because their\nstatistical significance must be weighted against\na \"background\", corresponding to the extrapolation of the trend of the measured correlation function for decreasing \u03c3Z . This extrapolation was\nempirically performed with an exponential function [21]. The method was recently improved by\nbuilding the uncorrelated yield following an independent emission model under the constraint of\ncharge conservation of the total system [22]. The\nresult, on the same Bob event sample, is shown\nin the right part of fig. 5. All correlations due to\ncharge conservation are now suppressed, and the\ncorrelation function is equal to 1 wherever no additional physical correlation is present. To make\nthe picture stronger, the peaks with a significance\nlower than 95% have been flattened out in fig. 5\n(right). Again one observes peaks for small values of \u03c3Z , the percentage of events concerned\nis 0.7%, which fully validates the published results [21].\n\nIn short simulations of central heavy ion collisions show that fingerprints of the spinodal decomposition of a nuclear system can be found,\nnamely a weakly but unambiguously enhanced\nproportion of equal-sized fragment partitions,\nand thus evidence its phase transition. A statistical model, like any model just based on\nphase space, will not show this type of phenomenon [22].\n\n\f3\n\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n\n1+R(<Z>,\u03c3Z)\n\nC\n\n5\n\n3\n\n2.5\n2\n\n1.5\n\n0.5\n\n1\n0\n0.5\n70\n22\n20\n60\n18\n0\n12\n16\n\u03a3Z 50\n0 2\n10\n14 Z>\n40\n8\n4\nf =\n12\n<\n\u03c3\n6\n6 8\n\u03c3Z\nM 30\n10\nZ\n4\n8\n2\n10 12\n\u00d7 20 0\n6\n<Z\n>\nFig. 5: Charge correlation function for events generated by stochastic mean field simulations of central 32 AMeV Xe+Sn\n\ncollisions, without (left) and with (right) charge conservation constraint on the uncorrelated yields.

EXPERIMENTAL INDICATIONS OF\nMULTIFRAGMENTATION IN THE SPINODAL\nREGION\n\nTwo reactions were studied by the INDRA collaboration which lead to systems with close total\nmass and charge (Z\u223c105, A\u223c250). The symmetric Xe+Sn system was studied between 25 and\n50 AMeV, and a class of events characterized as\nmultifragmentation of \"fused\" systems was recognized at and above 32 AMeV. Event selection\nwas performed on completeness and event shape\ncriteria, and the multifragmentation of deformed\nobjects was not considered in these samples [17,\n23]. The asymmetric Ni+Au system was studied from 32 to 90 AMeV. Owing to the thresholds of INDRA, and to the smaller c.m. velocity\nfor this asymmetric entrance channel, the number of complete events is very small. Methods\nselecting classes of events were developed, less\nstringent on completeness requirements. Two\nof these methods were used for isolating events\nsamples of central collisions with close distributions of global observables: the Principal Component Analysis method [24, 25]) for the sample\non which the heat capacity was determined and\nthe Discriminant Factorial Analysis method [26])\nfor the sample used for charge correlations.\n\n3.1.\n\nThe symmetric entrance channel\n\nThe heat capacity and the charge correlations\nwere both examined in the same samples of\nXe+Sn central collisions. Charge correlations are\npresented in fig. 6, for the four incident energies [27]. The correlation functions shown here\nare calculated without the charge conservation\nconstraint, and the figure only presents them for\nthe first bin \u03c3Z \u2208 [0 \u2212 1]. The data corresponding\nto an enhanced production of equal-sized fragment partitions with a high confidence level are\nindicated by darker points. This enhancement is\nonly observed at 32 and 39 AMeV, and correspond to 0.2 and 0.4% of the selected samples.\nThese percentages are close to those observed in\nthe Bob simulations, and may be interpreted in\nstating that the dynamics of multifragmentation\noccurs by spinodal decomposition in all the selected central collisions.\nThe heat capacity was determined on reconstructed freeze-out configurations out of the measured data [28]. The excitation energy scale\nwas obtained by calorimetry, including all measured fragments and twice the light charged particles emitted between 60 and 120deg in the c.m.\nNeutrons were estimated from mass conservation.

From [28]\n\nmined from a comparison of the data with results of a statistical multifragmentation model,\nand was subtracted from the excitation energy to\ngive the energy distributions shown by the lines\nin fig. 7. The potential energy was taken as the\nsum of the mass balance and of the Coulomb energy estimated through the Wigner-Seitz approximation, with a freeze-out volume V = 3 \u00d7 V0 .\n\nEnhanced partitions of equal-sized fragments\nwere looked for in central Ni+Au collisions at 32\nand 52 AMeV [31]. A statistically significant enhancement only appeared at 52 AMeV, as shown\nin fig. 3 3.2, where the correlation function is calculated without charge conservation constraint.\nResults with the new method can be found in\nthe contribution of B. Guiot, and agree with the\nabove statement.\nThe heat capacity was calculated for incident\nenergies of 32, 52, 74 and 90 AMeV. Precisions\non the implied assumptions are detailed in the\n\n\fcontribution of O. Lopez to this conference, in\nwhich the results are also unveiled. The energy\nscale is here obtained from calorimetry, using\nproducts emitted between 60 and 120deg c.m.\nwhatever their charge, due to stronger contributions of forward preequilibrium emissions with\nrespect to the symmetric entrance channel. A\nnegative branch of the heat capacity appears below 6-7 AMeV at the four incident energies. The\ndata at 32 AMeV should be taken with caution,\nas the average completeness of the events is poor\n(65% of the total charge). Indeed because of the\nlow value of the average excitation energy (3.5\nAMeV), one would expect to observe the first divergence of the heat capacity, while only the second one is seen, in the higher part of the energy\ndistribution. At the three other incident energies,\nthe average excitation energy varies little (5.5, 7,\n7 AMeV) and the heat capacity is negative in the\nfirst half of the distribution.\nFor this asymmetric entrance channel, multifragmentation in the spinodal region is shown\nby dynamical and thermodynamical signals at 52\nAMeV only. For collisions at higher energy only\nthe negative heat capacity was looked for, and\nfound. At 32 AMeV there is no sign of spinodal decomposition, and the data resemble more\na fusion-evaporation process [24]; surprisingly\nonly the negative part of the heat capacity was\nobserved despite the low excitation energies covered.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nNEW SIGNALS EVIDENCING A PHASE\nTRANSITION\nUniversal fluctuations of an order parameter\n\nThe recently developed theory of universal fluctuations in finite systems provides methods to\ncharacterize critical and off-critical behaviours,\nwithout any equilibrium assumption [33]. In this\nframework, universal \u2206 scaling laws of one of\nthe order parameters, p, should be observed:\nhpi\u2206 P (p) = \u03c6((p \u2212 pmp )/hpi\u2206 )\nwhere pmp stands for the most probable value\nof p. \u2206=1/2 corresponds to small fluctuations,\n\u03c3p2 \u223c hpi, and thus to an ordered phase. Conversely \u2206=1 occurs for the largest fluctuations\nnature provides, \u03c3p2 \u223c hpi2 , in a disordered phase.\n\n\u03c3Zmax\n\n7\n10\n9\n8\n\nXe + Sn\nINDRA data\n\n25\n\n7\n\n32\n\n\u2206 = 1/2\n\n6\n\n39 A.MeV\n5\n\n50 45\n4\n\n\u2206=1\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n< Zmax >\n\nFig. 9: Normalised first and second moments of the scaled\ndistributions of the event heaviest fragments, for Xe+Sn\ncentral collisions at five incident energies. The lines \u2206 = 1\nand 1/2 are shown to guide the eye. Note the two logarithmic scales. Adapted from [32].\n\nScaling laws may be expected for an order parameter p increasing with time, for instance the\nfragment multiplicity in a fragmentation process,\nor the largest fragment size in an aggregation\nprocess. The method was applied to the Xe+Sn\ncentral collision samples described in sect. 3,\nextended to the measurements performed at 25\nAMeV [32]. The fragment multiplicity distributions at the five energies scale with a small variance (\u2206=1/2), while the largest fragment distributions follow a \u2206=1/2 scaling at low energy (25\nand 32 AMeV) and a \u2206=1 scaling for the three\nhighest energies; fig. 9 illustrates the variation\nof \u03c3Zmax vs. Zmax . Following the authors of\nthis study, this indicates the transition from an ordered phase (evaporation?) to a disordered phase,\nthe fragments being produced following an aggregation scenario. Note that spinodal decomposition well enters this type of scenario.\n4.2.\n\nBimodality of an order parameter\n\nAn extended definition of first order phase transitions in finite systems was proposed in [34],\nbased on topology anomalies of the event distribution in the space of observation. In this framework when a nuclear system is in the coexistence region, the probability distribution of an order parameter is bimodal, each component being\na phase.

From [27]\n\nwere also analysed this way. Having in mind the\nliquid-gas coexistence region, one has to guess\nwhich fragments belong to each of the phases.\nOwing to the detailed shape of the charge distributions [27], Z=12 was tentatively put as a\nlimit between\nPthe two phases.\nP The chosen\nPsorting\nparameter, ( ZZ\u226513 \u2212\nZZ\u2208[3\u221212] )/ ZZ\u22653 ,\nmay be connected with the density difference of\nthe two phases (\u03c1L \u2212 \u03c1G ), which is an order parameter [13]. The results are displayed in fig. 10:\nnone of the distribution is Gaussian, which would\nsign a pure phase; but the gas phase is dominant\nabove 45 AMeV, while the liquid phase is more\nimportant at 32 AMeV. The two components are\nroughly equal at 39 AMeV.\nSimilar results were obtained on the Ni+Au\ncentral collision samples selected with the PCA.\nA similar sorting parameter, making use of only\nthe three largest fragments, was used. Its probability distribution exhibits two nearly equal peaks\nat 32 AMeV, a big \"gas\" peak with a small shoulder at 52 AMeV and a single phase picture at 90\nAMeV [25].\n\n5.\n\nSYNTHESIS OF THE OBSERVATIONS\nFOR SYSTEMS OF 250 NUCLEONS\n\nA synthesis of the signals which may sign a\nliquid-gas phase transition for nuclei of mass\n\u223c250 is presented in table I. The thermal and radial energy scales come from SMM simulations,\nwith respective uncertainties of 1 and 0.5 AMeV,\n\ndepending, for instance, on the event selections,\nthe freeze-out volume chosen . . . [24, 28]. The\nfirst evidence coming from this table is that for\nthe asymmetric entrance channel, multifragmentation of the fused system formed in central collision is not associated to a radial expansion. This\ncomes at variance of other results for similar\nsystems in the same energy range, for instance\nKr+Au [35]. Note that the result comes directly\nout of the data, as for Xe+Sn at 50 AMeV and\nNi+Au at 90 AMeV, the partitions are similar,\nwhile the average kinetic energies of a given fragment strongly differ, and are constant for Z between 12 and 30 for the latter system [25]\nFor both entrance channels, the systems reach\nthe spinodal region and remain there for a time\nsufficient to allow the development of spinodal\ninstabilities for thermal energies between 5 and\n6.5 AMeV, as attested by the observation of\nfavoured equal-sized fragment partitions and the\nnegative values of the heat capacities. When the\nthermal energy increases, the expansion energy\nseems to have a decisive role: without expansion,\nthe picture is similar to the one just described, up\nto \u03b5th =7.5 AMeV, while an expansion energy\nabove 25% of the thermal energy would make\nthe system cross too fast the spinodal region, toward the coexistence region or even the gas region. In this case neither the spinodal decomposition nor the negative heat capacity are observed.\nThe critical excitation energy, given by the maximum thermal energy of the systems described\nin this paper and shown to have fragmented in\nthe spinodal region is at least 7.5 AMeV, much\nabove the value given in [5]. It must however\nbe noted that the \"multifragmentation\" partitions\nanalysed in this reference comprise essentially\none large cluster and one intermediate mass fragment, together with nucleons and light charged\nparticles [36], at variance with the partitions observed in the INDRA data which have a larger\nnumber of fragments. In this sense the \"critical\"\nvalues of [5] would rather be assimilated to \"limiting\" temperatures, or excitation energies, as described in [37]. Above limiting values, a nucleus\nis unstable due to Coulomb forces, and can only\nde-excite through multifragmentation.\nWhat additional information is brought by the\nother signals quoted in table I? The universal\n\n\f9\nTable I: Summary of the phase transition signals described in the previous sections. \u03b5inc , \u03b5th , \u03b5rad , stand for the incident,\nthermal and expansion energies in AMeV (see text for precisions).

This can be interpreted as\nthe transition from the dominance of fusion evaporation to that of fusion-multifragmentation processes around this energy; indeed at 32 AMeV\nthe selected central collisions in Ni+Au present\nessentially the characteristics of an evaporation\nprocess [24]. In this sense, large fluctuations of\nZmax would sign the break-up of the system inside the coexistence region. Bimodality of a parameter related to the density of the system goes\nroughly in the same direction. Two peaks, indicating that the systems break in the coexistence\nregion, are observed in all the cases except for\nNi+Au at 90 AMeV. This would indicate a pure\ngas phase, and contradict somewhat the measurement of a negative heat capacity. The equal abundance of the two phases occurs for \u03b5th \u2264 5-6\nAMeV, above that energy nuclear systems would\nmainly multifragment.\n6.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\n\nThe results obtained in analysing central collisions leading to A\u223c250 systems through a symmetric and an asymmetric entrance channel show\nseveral features which may be taken as characteristics of a liquid-gas phase transition in nuclei.\nWhile each of these signals may not be conclusive by itself, their concomitance gives strength\nto the assumed scenario. In the next future, one\nmay try to find other variables or signals which\nwould support the existence of the phase transition. It is also worth looking to all these signals\nfor quasi-projectile nuclei, of which INDRA possess a tremendous collection, spanning Ar, Ni,\n\nXe+Sn\n45.\n6.6\n1.7\nno\nno\n1\n2\n\nXe+Sn\n50.\n7.0\n2.0\nno\nno\n1\n2\n\nNi+Au\n74.\n7.0\n0.\nyes\n-\n\nNi+Au\n90.\n7.5\n\u2264 0.5\nyes\n1\n\nXe, Gd, Ta, U projectiles.\nNext, enriched knowledge of nuclear matter\nproperties will come from taking into account\nits two component nature (neutrons and protons),\nby exploring collisions induced by exotic projectiles when they are available.
