Introduction\nTwisted K-theory has recently attracted much attention, both in mathematics and in string\ntheory. Most notable among the results obtained in this subject is the theorem by Freed,\nHopkins and Teleman (FHT) relating twisted K-theory to the Verlinde algebra [1,2,3],\nwhich seen in the light of efforts in string theory to relate K-theory to D-brane charges, as\ncomputed from conformal field theory data, is indeed very suggestive.\nIn string theory, the importance of K-theory is founded upon the conjecture that\nD-brane charges are classified by the K-theory of the target space [4,5]. This conjecture\nhas been tested in various instances, when both an algebraic description of the D-branes\nin terms of boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) as well as the relevant K-theory\nare accessible to explicit computations. Most prominent examples of theories, where the\nBCFT is under control are free CFTs, orbifolds, WZW and coset models. The relation\nto K-theory has been established in a vast number of examples for the free and orbifold\ntheories. In the case of (supersymmetric) WZW models, the presence of the non-trivial\nbackground B-field implies that D-brane charges should take values in a twisted version\nof K-theory. The K-theories relevant for WZW models have been computed in [6,7,8] and\nindicate that the known boundary states do not in general suffice to fill up the charge\nlattice that is predicted by K-theory.\nIn this paper the correspondence between D-brane charges and K-theory shall be\nexplored for coset CFTs [9]. Supersymmetry is key to the present discussion, and the\nrelevant models are the Kazama-Suzuki coset theories [10], of which the Grassmannian\nand generalized parafermionic cosets shall be of foremost interest. Using the FHT result,\nwe provide the computation of the twisted equivariant K-groups associated to these models\nand discuss the relation to the BCFT.\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In section 2, we discuss as a prelude the superminimal models, and compare K-theory to BCFT in this simplest example. Section 3\nprovides some detail on the CFT-side of the cosets. The main result is contained in\nsection 4, where we use the theorem by FHT [1,2] to compute the twisted equivariant\nK-theory of the coset models. A matching with the BCFT results is established in the case\nof Grassmannian cosets, and we close with concluding remarks and acknowledgements.\n1\n\n\f2. Superparafermions\nThe super-minimal models, realized as superparafermionic u(1) cosets of the su(2)k WZW\nmodels, are the simplest examples of N = 2 superconformal field theories. In this section\nwe review the boundary CFT in these models, as well as compute the K-theory lattice\nof D-brane charges. This should serve as an appetizer to subsequent sections, where\ngeneralizations to other N = 2 coset theories shall be discussed.\n2.1. The boundary CFT side\nThe superparafermions [11,10] have a representation in terms of the coset models\nsu(2)k \u2295 u(1)4\n.\nu(1)2(k+2)\n\n(2.1)\n\nThe highest weight representations will be labeled by (\u039b, m, a), where \u039b is an su(2)k weight,\nm labels the u(1)2(k+2) representations and a specifies the weight of u(1)4 . The induced\nlevel 2\u03ba = 2(k + 2) of the u(1)2(k+2) denominator theory indicates that the weight m takes\nvalues in ZZ/2(k + 2). The theories (2.1) are obtained as supersymmetric generalizations\nof the coset construction for su(2)/u(1), where dim(su(2)) \u2212 dim(u(1)) adjoint fermions,\ndescribed by the u(1)4 factor, are introduced. The corresponding representation label a\ntakes values in ZZ/4. The coset selection and identification rules are\n\u039b + m + a \u2208 2ZZ ,\n(\u039b, m, a) \u2261 (k \u2212 \u039b, m + k + 2, a + 2) ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhich are obtained in the standard fashion by acting with the proper automorphism \u03c3 :\n\u039b = [\u03bb1 ] \u2192 [k \u2212 \u03bb1 ] on the modular S-matrices [12]. The theories (2.1) are the simplest\nexamples of the generalized parafermion cosets su(n + 1)k /u(1)n , and the supersymmetric\nGrassmannian coset models su(n + 1)k /u(n).\nThe boundary states for (2.1) are well known [13,14,15,16] and a brief review of the\nresults necessary for the present discussion is in place. We shall focus on A-type boundary\nstates for the N = 2 algebra. In view of the comparison to K-theory, the lattice of RRcharges will be of main interest. In the BCFT this is computed by the intersection index\n[17], which in the case of the N = 2 superparafermion coset models has been obtained in\n[13,18,15]. Recall that the intersection index in the closed string picture is defined in terms\nof the overlaps of the RR-sectors of the boundary states [18,15]. The key observation in\n[15] is that the states with \u039b = 0 form a generating set for the charge lattice of boundary\n2\n\n\fstates in the superparafermion models. In detail, the boundary state intersection for Cardy\nstates ||(\u039bi , mi , 0)ii is\nI(\u039b1 ,\u039b2 )\n\n\u0001\n\nm1 ,m2\n\n\u2212m2\n= N\u039bm11,\u039b\n2\n\n\uf8eb\nX\n=\uf8ed\nN \u039b1\n\n\u0393,\u039b2\n\n\u0393\n\nX\n\nX\n\nm w\u2208Wsu(2)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u01ebw g \u2212m+m0 \uf8f8\n\n,\n\n(2.3)\n\nm1 ,m2\n\nwhere the first sum extends over all su(2) level k representations, and the second sum is\nover all states, that are coset fields representing Ramond sector ground states, i.e., which\nby [19] take the form (\u039b, m, a), with m, \u039b \u2208 ZZ, such that\nm = w(\u039b + 1) ,\n\n(2.4)\n\nfor some element w in the su(2) Weyl group, Wsu(2) = h\u00b11Ii. Further m0 = 1 is the u(1)\ncharge of the spectral flow operator, and N and g are the su(2) and u(1) fusion matrices,\nrespectively. In detail, the fusion matrix element for the u(1) fields m, m1 , m2 is given by\n(g m )m1 m2 = \u03b4m1 ,m2 +m , or equivalently, g is the shift matrix gm1 m2 = \u03b4m1 ,m2 +1 . In (2.3)\nwe have fixed a = 0 and view I as a matrix in the denominator u(1) weights, mi . By\nperforming the sum over the u(1) weights m, that are allowed by (2.4) for a given su(2)\nweight \u0393 we arrive at\nI(\u039b1 ,\u039b2 ) =\n\nX\n\n\u039b1\n(g \u2212\u0393 \u2212 g \u0393+2 ) .\nN\u0393,\u039b\n2\n\n(2.5)\n\n\u0393\n\nTo prove that the \u039b = 0 states, with fixed value of a, form a basis of the charge lattice,\nfirst note that\nI(0,0) = 1I \u2212 g 2 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe matrices (2.5) with general values for \u039b1 and \u039b2 can be obtained from the following\nlinear combination\n(g \u2212\u039b1 + g \u2212\u039b1 +2 + * * * + g \u039b1 ) I(0,0) (g \u2212\u039b2 + g \u2212\u039b2 +2 + * * * + g \u039b2 )\nX\n0\n= (g \u2212\u039b1 + g \u2212\u039b1 +2 + * * * + g \u039b1 )\nN\u0393,\u039b\n(g \u2212\u0393 \u2212 g \u0393+2 )\n2\n=\n\nX\n\n\u0393\n\n(2.7)\n\n\u039b1\nN\u0393,\u039b\n(g \u2212\u0393 \u2212 g \u0393+2 ) ,\n2\n\n\u0393\n\nwhere the last step follows by inserting the explicit form of the fusion coefficients\n(e.g.[20,21]). In particular for su(2) these are\n\u039b1\nN\u0393,\u039b\n=\n2\n\nX\n\nX\n\n\u01ebw \u03b4w(\u039b+\u0393+1)\u2212\u039b2 \u22121 ,\n\n\u039b\u2208P\u039b1 w\u2208Wsu(2)\n\n3\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fwhere P\u039b is the weight system of \u039b. Thus all boundary intersections can be written in\nterms of the intersection of \u039b = 0 states. (2.6) and the explicit form of the matrix g, which\nshifts every u(1) label by one, implies that the rank of I(0,0) is k + 1.\nThere are two types of A-branes, which satisfy the gluing conditions G\u00b1 = \u00b1\u1e20\u2213 ,\nwhich were refered to as even (odd) branes in [14]. Naively, each of these give rise to a\ncharge lattice ZZk+1 , thus resulting in the total charge lattice ZZ2(k+1) , which is isomorphic\nto the Verlinde fusion ring of u(1)2(k+1) , i.e.\nVu(1)2(k+1) =\n\nRu(1)\n= ZZ2(k+1) ,\nI2(k+1)\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere Ru(1) \u223c\n= ZZ[\u03b6, \u03b6 \u22121 ] is the representation ring of u(1) and I2(k+1) is the Verlinde ideal.\nTaking the point of view of the gauged WZW model, the \u039b = 0 states can be seen to\nform a basis for the charge lattice as follows. As explained in [22,14], the parafermions (2.1)\nhave a disk target space (together with a non-trivial B-field and dilaton). For fixed level\nk we introduce k + 2 even and k + 2 odd points on the boundary of the disk. Then it was\nshown in [14] that there are (k +2)(k +1) even (odd) A-branes, corresponding to D1-branes\nstretching between the even (odd) points. The \u039b = 0 D1-branes ||0, n, sii stretch between\nconsecutive points (of same chirality, that is, even or odd), i.e., between (n\u22121)\u03c0/(k+2) and\n(n + 1)\u03c0/(k + 2), and are thus the shortest D1-branes. From the tachyons analysis in [14]\nwe follow that two consecutive such D1-branes ||0, n, sii and ||0, n + 2, sii, decay and merge\nto give a D1-brane with non-trivial \u039b, ||1, n + 1, sii, as depicted in Figure 1. Iterating this\nprocess we can produce all branes (for fixed chirality) from the \u039b = 0 states, as expected\nfrom the above intersection index computation. These decays have been analyzed also in\n[23,16].\n\u039b=0\n\n\u039b=1\n\n\u039b=0\n\nFigure 1 Decay of two \u039b = 0 into a \u039b = 1 D-brane for k = 6.\n4\n\n\fA simple counting argument then provides the charge lattice: there are k + 2 even\npoints, and therefore k + 2 D1-branes with \u039b = 0. Since in addition the full ring of \u039b = 0\nstates is trivial, one of these branes is redundant. The charge lattice for the even branes\nis therefore ZZk+1 . The same argument holds for the odd branes, so that the total charge\nlattice is ZZ2(k+1) . This discussion is therefore in agreement with the calculation in terms\nof the intersection index.\n2.2. Twisted equivariant K-theory \u03c4KU(1) (SU (2))\nThis section provides a comparison of the D-brane charges, as computed in the last\nsection, with K-theory. The gauged WZW description dictates what the relevant K-theory\nfor these backgrounds is. The gauging implies that the K-theory needs to be equivariant\nwith respect to the conjugation action, and the presence of the non-trivial B-field necessitates a non-trivial twisting with respect to a 3-form. For other discussion of equivariant\nand twisted K-theory see e.g. [24,25,26,27,28,3,1,29].\nIn the case of the SU (2)/U (1) coset we can compute the twisted equivariant K-group\ndirectly, using a Mayer-Vietoris argument. This calculation generalizes in principle to\nSU (N ) with N > 2, but the story gets more involved due to the rather complicated cell\nstructure (see e.g. [30]) and other ways of computation will be more suitable. A calculation\nsimilar in spirit to the one presented in this section can be found in [1] for \u03c4KSU(2) (SU (2)).\nThe geometrical action corresponding to the CFT coset is the conjugation action.\nThus, the action of U (1) on SU (2) is\nSU (2) \u220b g 7\u2192 diag(eit , e\u2212it ) g diag(e\u2212it , eit ) .\n\n(2.10)\n\nThe fixed point set is an S 1 .

So,\n\nchoosing the analogous covering for A \u2229 B = S 2 as in (2.11), we obtain\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)\n(S 2 ) \u2212\u2192 RU(1) \u2295 RU(1)\n\u2191\n0\n\u2190\u2212\n0\n\n\u03c8\n\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2190\u2212\n\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)\n(S 1 )\n\u2193\n.\n\u03c4 1\nKU(1) (S 2 )\n\n(2.14)\n\nNow note that S 1 = U (1)/ZZ2 . To see this, note that the S 1 in the intersection of the\ncovers of S 2 is embedded into the SU (2) by\nS \u223c\n=\n1\n\n\u001c\u0012\n\n0\n\u2212e\u2212i\u03b8\n\nei\u03b8\n0\n\n\u0013\u001d\n\n,\n\n(2.15)\n\nwhereupon the action of the U (1) as of (2.10) is by twice the angle. Thus\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)\n(S 1 ) = \u03c4KZ0Z2 (pt.) = ZZ2 ,\n\n(2.16)\n\nthe map \u03c8 is given by\n\u03c8:\n\n(\u03c7, \u03c7\u2032 ) 7\u2192 (\u03c7(1) \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 (1) , \u03c7(\u22121) \u2212 \u03c7\u2032 (\u22121)) .\n\n(2.17)\n\n1\nHence the cokernel is \u03c4KU(1)\n(A \u2229 B) = 0 and the kernel is\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)\n(A \u2229 B) = ( RU(1) \u2295 RU(1) )/\u03c8 ,\n\n(2.18)\n\ni.e., these are pairs of characters identified at id and \u2212id, and so the quotient by \u03c8 removes\ntwo copies of ZZ.\nPutting this together, the map \u03c6 in (2.12) becomes\n\u03c6:\n\nRU(1) \u2295 RU(1) \u2192 ( RU(1) \u2295 RU(1) )\n(f , g) 7\u2192 (f + gL\u03ba , f + gL\u2212\u03ba ) ,\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhere L is the generator of RU(1) and we have used the fact that due to the twisting, the\nbundles over A and B are patched together by tensoring with the twist-class. So this has\n0\ntrivial kernel, i.e., \u03c4KU(1)\n(SU (2)) = 0. The cokernel, (without the \u03c8 identification) would\n\n6\n\n\fbe (RU(1) \u2295 RU(1) )/I\u03ba , where the ideal is I\u03ba = (L\u03ba \u2212 L\u2212\u03ba ), and so the cokernel would\nbe isomorphic to ZZ2\u03ba . Including the \u03c8 identification then results in ZZ2\u03ba\u22122 . We conclude\nthereby that\n\u03c4\n\n1\nKU(1)\n(SU (2)) = ZZ2\u03ba\u22122 = ZZ2(k+1) ,\n\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)\n(SU (2)) = 0 .\n\n(2.20)\n\nComparison with (2.9) then yields that\n1\nKU(1)\n(SU (2)) =\n\nRu(1)\n,\nI2(k+1)\n\n(2.21)\n\nwhich is reminiscent of the statement in [1,3] in the case of the topological G/G coset and\nG-equivariant twisted K-theory of G.\n2.3. Comparision between K-theory and D-brane charges\nIn the comparison between K-theory and D-brane charges there are two subtle points\nthat one has to take into account. Firstly, in order to compare the K-theory to the CFT,\nwe note, that not only the equivariance with respect to the u(1) action has to be taken\ninto account. Recall that the selection and identification rules amount to modding out in\naddition with the common centre of su(2) and u(1), i.e., with ZZ2 as specified in the second\nequation of (2.2). Hence, the CFT needs to be compared to \u03c4 KU(1)/ZZ2 (SU (2)). The key\nchange that occurs in the above K-theory computation is then that (2.16) is replaced by\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)/\n(S 1 ) = \u03c4K 0 (pt.) = ZZ ,\nZZ2\n\n(2.22)\n\nwherefore\n\u03c4\n\n1\nKU(1)/\n(SU (2)) = ZZ\u03ba\u22121 = ZZk+1 ,\nZZ2\n\n\u03c4\n\n0\nKU(1)/\n(SU (2)) = 0 .\nZZ2\n\n(2.23)\n\nThis corresponds precisely to the charges carried by the even (or odd) branes.\nThe second point to note is that K-theory is meant to classify the charges of Dbranes in string theory (as opposed to CFT). In addition to conformal field-theoretical\nconsistency conditions, in string theory the GSO-projection has to be imposed upon the\nboundary states. As is familiar from other super-string backgrounds (see e.g., [31]), this\ndoes indeed cut down the number of allowed D-branes. E.g. in flat space Type II theories,\nGSO-invariance of the boundary states implies that both the NSNS and the RR sector\nparts of the boundary states have to be GSO-invariant, which implies that there are only\nhalf as many GSO-invariant boundary states than Ishibashi states (as opposed to BCFT,\nwhere the number of Cardy states equals the number of Ishibashi states). We conjecture\nthat a similar reduction occurs for the above coset models. In the present case the NS (R)\nsector corresponds to even (odd) a, i.e., the NSNS and RR sector branes are precisely the\neven and odd branes, respectively. To confirm this, one should consider a proper, critical\nstring background based on these coset theories, such as are provided by Gepner models.\n7\n\n\f3. N = 2 coset models and D-brane charges\nIn the following, we shall generalize the computations from SU (2)/U (1) to the Grassmann\nmodels and generalized parafermions. We will step back for a moment and provide some\nrelevant facts of these N = 2 coset CFTs.\n3.1. Supersymmetric coset models\nRecall that any WZW model for a compact Lie group G, described by affine gk at level\nk, can be supersymmetrized to an N = 1 SCFT by introducing dim(g) fermionic fields\ntransforming in the adjoint representation [32]. This theory is most elegantly described by\n'decoupling' the bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom (see e.g. [10]), which results in\nshifting the level of the KM theory. The N = 1 supersymmetric version for gk is then\ngk\u2212g \u2295 so(dim(g))1 ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere g is the dual Coxeter number such that facd fbcd = g \u03b4ab . The central charge of the\nmodel is thus\nc =\n\n(k \u2212 g) dim(g)\n1\ndim(g) +\n.\n2\nk\n\n(3.2)\n\nDue to the product structure of (3.1), it usually suffices to study the bosonic gk model\nand infer from there the supersymmetric statements by tensoring with the so(d)1 theory.\nIn particular, this was used in [6] to compare the boundary states to K-theory charges.\nThe supersymmetrization of coset models is slightly more intricate. Let h be a sub-Lie\nalgebra of g. The supersymmetric construction for gk contains one for h, and one can apply\nthe coset construction to this pair of theories. The so-obtained N = 1 supersymmetric\ncoset models are of the form\n\ngk \u2295 so(2d)1\n,\nhk+gg \u2212gh\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere d = 21 (dim(g) \u2212 dim(h)) and g denotes the dual Coxeter numbers of the respective\nLie algebras. The so(2d)1 part again parametrizes d complex fermions. Note that this\ncorresponds to the supersymmetric version of gk+gg /h. It is important to realize that h\nis embedded diagonally into gk \u2295 so(2d)1 and hence, that the theory does not simply\nfactorize into bosonic and fermionic contributions, as e.g. in the WZW models. This is\napparent from the way the h current algebra is constructed in [10]. One consequence of\nthis for the present purposes is that the bosonic results for coset branes in gk /h will not\nsimply carry over to the supersymmetrized theory. There are non-trivial selection rules\n8\n\n\ffor highest weights in the supersymmetric coset, which non-trivially mix the weights of g,\nso(2d) and h (see below).\nGenerically, (3.3) is an N = 1 theory. As is well known from [10], for rank(g) =\nrank(h), the coset theory is N = 2 if the geometric (right-action) coset space G/H of\nthe corresponding Lie groups is K\u00e4hler. The representations of the coset model (3.3) are\nlabeled by highest weights (\u039b, \u03bb, a), which correspond to gk , hk+gg \u2212gh and so(2d)1 highest\nweights, respectively. However, not all combinations of weights are distinct in the coset\ntheory. Gepner developed a general method how to extract the field identifications in coset\nmodels by analyzing the action of certain automorphisms on the S-modular matrix [12].\n3.2. Grassmanian coset models Gr(n, k)\nThe models of interest in the following are the generalized super-conformal minimal\nmodels based on the Grassmannians G(n, n+k) of n-planes in Cn+k , which after level-rank\nduality take the form of projective cosets\nGr(n, k) :\n\nsu(n + 1)k \u2295 so(2n)1\n.\nsu(n)k+1 \u2295 u(1)n(n+1)(k+n+1)\n\n(3.4)\n\nThe level of u(1)n(n+1)(k+n+1) indicates the weights are ZZn(n+1)(k+n+1) -valued. The central charge is c = 3nk/(k + n + 1) and the weights are labeled by (\u039b, \u03bb, m, a), where \u03bb and\nm correspond to su(n) and u(1) weights, respectively, as well as so(2n)1 weights a \u2208 ZZ/4.\nThe highest weights in the basis of fundamental weights are\n(n)\n\n\u039b = (\u039b1 , * * * , \u039bn ) , \u03bb = (\u039b1 , * * * , \u039bn\u22121 ) , m = (n + 1)\u039b\n\n*\u039b=\n\nn\nX\n\ni\u039bi .\n\n(3.5)\n\ni=1\n\nNot all combinations of weights in (3.5) are distinct in the theory and certain field identifications need to be imposed. Recall from [12] that an automorphism \u03c3 of the extended\nDynkin diagram of gk is defined to be proper, if\n\u03c3(\u03bb) = \u03c3(0) + w\u03c3 (\u03bb) ,\n\n(3.6)\n\nfor some fixed w\u03c3 \u2208 W . For any proper automorphism \u03c3(0) = k\u03bb\u03c3 , where \u03bb\u03c3 is a level 1\nweight (specified for each such \u03c3). The field identification rules are extracted by considering\ng,k\nthe action of proper automorphisms on the S-modular matrix. Let S\u039b,\u0393\nbe the S-modular\n\nmatrix for gk . Using the explicit form of S it follows that\ng,k\ng,k\nS\u03c3(\u039b),\u0393\n= e2\u03c0i\u03bb\u03c3 \u0393 S\u039b,\u0393\n.\n\n9\n\n(3.7)\n\n\fThen, fields for which the phase in (3.7) vanishes need to be identified in order to ensure\nthat the modular matrix has full rank.\nConsider thus the proper automorphisms, acting on su(n+1) and so(2d)1 , respectively,\nas\n\u03c3(\u039b) = k\u039b(1) + w\u03c3 (\u039b) ,\n\n\u03c3v (a) = v + w\u03c3v (a) ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere v is the so(2d)1 vector weight. Note that for su(n + 1) the proper outer automorphisms are given by the order n + 1 rotation group of the extended Dynkin diagram,\ni.e.\n\u03c3\n\nn\nX\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi \u039b(i)\n\n!\n\n= (k \u2212 \u03bb1 \u2212 * * * \u2212 \u03bbn ) \u039b(1) + \u03bb1 \u039b(2) + * * * + \u03bbn\u22121 \u039b(n) .\n\n(3.9)\n\nThere are two combinations of these automorphisms that can be applied to the coset fields\nJ1 (\u039b, \u03bb, m, a) = (\u03c3(\u039b), \u03c3(\u03bb), m + k + n + 1, \u03c3v (a)) ,\nJ2 (\u039b, \u03bb, m, a) = (\u03c3(\u039b), \u03bb, m + n(k + n + 1), \u03c3vn (a)) ,\n\n(3.10)\n\nwhich are of order n(n + 1) and n + 1 respectively, since \u03c3 on su(n) is of order n. Applying\n(3.7) and (3.10), shows that the phase vanishes, and thus that the S-matrix elements for\nthe coset field and its images under J1 and J2 are the same (cf. [19,12]). This leads us to\nidentify the fields (3.10) in order to maintain unitarity of the S-matrix. For later reference,\nrecall that the dimension of the chiral ring is\ndim RGr(n,k) =\n\n(n + k)!\n.\nn! k!\n\nA peculiar property of the Gr(n, k) is that they are conjectured to be invariant under\nthe exchange of k and n, i.e.,\nGr(n, k) \u223c\n= Gr(k, n) .\n\n(3.11)\n\nDespite the lack of a full proof of this level-rank duality, very convincing arguments have\nbeen put forward, most notably in [10], where it is shown that the coset representation\nof the N = 2 superconformal algebra is symmetric in k and n. Furthermore, in [33] an\nisomorphism between the chiral data is constructed. This implies in particular, that the\ncorresponding boundary theories need to respect level-rank duality.\nThe boundary intersection index Iab = TrHopen\n(\u22121)F = RR hha||biiRR [17,18,13] for the\nab\nGrassmannian coset models has been computed in [15]. It was indicated there that, as\ndiscussed earlier for the superminimal model, it is sufficient to compute the index for the\n10\n\n\f\u039b = 0 Cardy boundary states. The rank of the charge lattice is equal to the dimension of\nthe chiral ring, i.e.,\n\n\u0012\n\nn+k\nn\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(3.12)\n\nThe result (3.12) refers to the charges of even or odd maximally supersymmetric D-branes\nin the Grassmannian coset CFTs and the purpose of the subsequent section is to derive\nthis result for the charge lattice by a K-theory computation.\n3.3. Superparafermion coset modesl SP F (n, k)\nA related coset model is that of SU (n) by its maximal torus, i.e. the generalized\nsuperparafermions,\nSP F (n, k) :\n\nsu(n + 1)k \u2295 so(n(n + 1))1\n.\nu(1)n\n\n(3.13)\n\nThe BCFT will be discussed elsewhere, however, we shall provide the corresponding Ktheory calculation below. The selection and identification rules which are needed for this\ncomputation are as follows.\nThe center of SU (n + 1), or equivalently the outer automorphism group of its affine\nversion, is generated by the order n +1 rotation \u03c3 of the extended Dynkin diagram. Again,\n\u03c3v acts on the so(n(n + 1))1 , with \u03c3v (0) = v. This imposes the identification rule\n( \u03c3(\u039b) , m + \u03c3(0) , \u03c3vn (a) ) = (\u039b , m , a ) ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nwhere \u03c3(0) = (k + n + 1)\u039b(1) .\nThe dimension of the chiral ring in this case, using [19], is computed to be\ndim RSP F (n,k) =\n\n(k + n)!\n.\nk!\n\n4. Twisted equivariant K-theory\nThis section provides the computation of the twisted equivariant K-groups relevant for the\ngeneralized parafermions and Grassmannian coset models.\n11\n\n\f4.1. \u03c4KH (G)\nLet G be a simple, simply-connected, connected Lie group (i.e., in particular \u03c01 is\ntorsion-free). For most purposes we shall consider G = SU (N + 1). Further let H be a\nconnected, maximal rank subgroup of G. Then the computation of \u03c4KH (G) can be traced\nback to the computation of Freed, Hopkins and Teleman in [1,2] of \u03c4KG (G). The theorem\nby FHT states, that twisted G-equivariant K-theory of G is isomophic as an algebra to\nthe Verlinde algebra of G at a level k determined by the 3-form that specifies the twist \u03c4\nof the K-theory\n\u03c4\n\ndim(G)\n\nKG\n\n(G) = Vk (G) .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe twist \u03c4 given by the k + g multiple of the generator of H 3 (G, ZZ), which corresponds\nto the H = dB 3-form flux. The important point about (4.1) that stresses its possible\nrelevance for coset models is that the G-equivariance is taken with respect to the adjoint\naction of G on itself.\nThe case of coset models, where H is a proper, connected, maximal rank subgroup,\nrelates to this result as follows. First define\n\b\nGc \u00d7H G = (g, g\u0303) \u2208 G \u00d7 G ; (g, g\u0303) \u223c (h\u22121 gh, g\u0303h) , h \u2208 H .\n\n(4.2)\n\nHere, Gc indicates that the action of H on G is taken to be the conjugation action, whereas\non the second factor, the action is the right action. Then the map\nGc \u00d7H G \u2192 Gc \u00d7 G/H\n\n\u03a6 :\n\n(g, g\u0303) 7\u2192 (g\u0303gg\u0303 \u22121 , g\u0303H) ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nis well-defined and an isomorphism. In order to calculate the twisted equivariant K-groups,\nnote further, that for any H-space\nKG (X \u00d7H G) \u223c\n= KH (X) ,\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhere the equivariance is with respect to the specified action of H on X. This is simply\nthe statement that any G-bundle over G \u00d7H X is determined by the underlying H-bundle\nover X. Hence, setting Gc = X we obtain\nKG (Gc \u00d7 G/H) = KG (Gc \u00d7H G) \u223c\n= KH (Gc ) ,\n12\n\n(4.5)\n\n\fFor \u03c01 (G) torsion-free, an equivariant form of the K\u00fcnneth formula holds by a result of\nHodgkin and Snaith [34,35], whereby\u266d\n\u03c4\n\nKH (G) = \u03c4KG (G) \u2297RG RH ,\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhere R denotes as before the representation rings of the respective groups. Note that we\nused the isomorphism KG (G/H) \u223c\n= KH (pt.), which is true since any G-bundle on G/H is\nof the form G \u00d7H R \u2192 G \u00d7H pt. = G/H for a H-representation R.\nWe can now complete our computation of KH (G). For RH free as an RG -module,\nwhich holds for H of maximal rank and connected [36], we can use the FHT result (4.1)\nto simplify (4.6) into\n\u03c4\n\nKH (G) =\n\nRH\n.\nIG\n\n(4.7)\n\nIG is the Verlinde ideal of G, that is, the ideal, that provides the identifications necessary\nin order to obtain the Verlinde algebra at a specified level from the representation ring of\nG as V G = RG /IG . The Schubert-like combinatorial relations, that define the ideal IG\nwere obtained in [37].\nFirst, in order to elucidate (4.7), it is useful to recall how the representation rings of G\nand H are related. Since any G-representation can be decomposed into H-representations,\nRG < RH . More precisely, by definition the representation ring is\nRG \u223c\n= ZZ[\u039b(1) , * * * , \u039b(n) ] ,\n= ZZ[M \u22c6 ]WG \u223c\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere M \u22c6 is the weight lattice, WG the Weyl group, so that ZZ[M \u22c6 ]WG is the polynomial\nring of invariant polynomials in the weights. Since any representation can be decomposed\ninto representations with highest weights equal to the fundamental weights \u039b(i) , the latter\nform a basis of the representation ring.\n\u266d\n\nMore precisely, the theorem states the existence of a K\u00fcnneth spectral sequence, with E2\u2212p,q =\n\np\nq\nq\nT orR\n(\u03c4KG\n(G), KH\n(pt.)) converging to \u03c4 KH (G). However, in the present context RH is a free\nG\n\nmodule over RG , wherefore the higher Tor's vanish and the spectral sequence collapses. See e.g.\n[8] for a case where this spectral sequence is non-trivial.\n\n13\n\n\f4.2. Twist-class and level of the Verlinde-ideal\nTo compare the above results with the intersection index calculation it is interesting\nto compute the induced level of the Verlinde ideal entering the K-theory calculation in\n(4.7). Recall, that each invariant symmetric bilinear form on the Lie algebra g is in one\nf \u2192 Lg of the loop algebra [38].\nto one correspondence with central extensions IR \u2192 Lg\nThis relation follows by noting that each such bilinear form h, i on g defines a cocycle\n\u03c9 : Lg \u00d7 Lg \u2192 IR on the corresponding loop algebra Lg as\n\u03c9(\u03be(z), \u03b7(z)) = Resz=0 h \u03be(z), d\u03b7(z) i .\n\n(4.9)\n\ng \u2192 LG of the\nIf \u03c9 is integral then there is a corresponding central extension U (1) \u2192 LG\nloop group LG.\n\nIn the case of \u03c4 KG (G), the twist-class is an equivariant integral cohomology class \u03c4\n3\nin HG\n(G). In [3] the twistings were chosen, such that the restriction to HT3 (T ), where T is\nthe maximal torus of G, have trivial components in H 3 (T ). In this case it was shown that\nthe twisted equivariant K-theory with complex coefficients can be computed as a twisted\ncohomology with coefficients in a line-bundle L\u03c4 , which is determined by the class \u03c4 ,\n\u03c4\n\n0/1\n\n\u03c4 even/odd\n(Gg ; L\u03c4 (g)) ,\nKG (G; C)\u2227\ng = H\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere \u2227 denotes completion (see e.g. [39]). L\u03c4 is determined by \u03c4 as follows. \u03c4 \u2208 H 2 (BT )\u2297\nH 1 (T ), by the assumption that \u03c4 |H 3 (T ) = 0. Thus, it defines a map \u03c4 : T \u2192 T \u2228 . The sheaf\nL\u03c4 (t) for t \u2208 T is \u03c4 (t), which specifies a line bundle over T , since T \u2228 labels line-bundles\n0/1\nover T . \u03c4 KG (G; C)\u2227\ng can be viewed as the completion of sections of a sheaf (denoted\n\u03c4\n\nK in [3]) over the GIT-quotient G C //G C . The simplification that occurs in the above\nKG (G) case is that \u03c4 K is a skyscraper-sheaf with one-dimensional stalks, and thus the\ntwisted K-theory can be calculated exactly by means of this completion technique. Note,\nthat these results hold for K-theory with complex coefficients, and thus in particular do\nnot take into account torsion. The case of integral K-theory will be discussed in [40].\nAll this extends to the case of interest in this paper, i.e., H-equivariant K-theory of\n3\nG. The twistings are in HH\n(G), and we restrict them to HT3H (TG ), whereby TG is the\nmaximal torus of G. Again, in HT3H (TG ) = H 3 (ETH \u00d7TH TG ) we assume that \u03c4 restricts\n\u2228\ntrivially to H 3 (TH ). Thus \u03c4 gives rise to a map TH \u2192 TH\n, thus specifying a line-bundle\nover each point in TH .\n3\nA comment on induced level. Fix an element \u03c4 \u2208 HH\n(G) to be the (topological)\nlevel of a central extension of LG. Then we can write this as k + g times the generator\n3\nof HH\n(G), with k the level and g the dual Coxeter number. The induced twisting on a\nsubgroup H will be k + g, wherefore the induced level is k + g \u2212 gH , where gH is the dual\nCoxeter number for H.\n14\n\n\f4.3. KU(1) (SU (2)) revisited\nAs a first application of the above results, we revisit the calculation for SU (2)/U (1),\nwhich we already performed using the cell complex earlier. The representation ring of\nSU (2) is RSU(2) = ZZ[\u039b], where \u039b labels the fundamental representation. The ring RU(1)\nis generated by the one-dimensional representation. More precisely, a representation of\nU (1) is specified by an integer p, such that\n\u03b6 p : U (1) \u2192 GL(C)\nei\u03b8 7\u2192 eip\u03b8 *\n\n(4.11)\n\n,\n\ni.e., U (1) acts by multiplication with the pth powers of its generators. Since \u03b6 p \u2297\u03b6 q = \u03b6 p+q ,\nthe representation ring is generated by \u03b6, \u03b6 \u22121 and is isomorphic to ZZ[\u03b6, \u03b6 \u22121 ]. The twisting\nk\nfor SU (2) is k + 2 and the standard Verlinde ideal is\u266f ISU(2)\n= h\u039bk+1 i. To compute (4.7)\n\nin this context we note that the representation ring of SU (2) is embedded into that of\nU (1) by the identification \u039b = \u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 , and thus\n\u03c4\n\nKU(1) (SU (2)) =\n\nRSU(2)\nZZ(\u03b6)\n\u2297 RU(1) =\n= ZZ2(k+1) ,\nk+1\nh\u039b\ni\nh (\u03b6 + \u03b6 \u22121 )k+1 i\n\n(4.12)\n\nin degree dim(SU (2)), i.e. for all odd degrees, and vanishes otherwise. This is precisely\nour result (2.20). The induced level for the Verlinde ideal as embedded into RU(1) is again\nk and the twisting \u03c4 = (k + 2).\n4.4. KU(n) (SU (n + 1))\nNext we generalize this to the Grassmannian coset models. First recall that\nk\n\u223c\nVSU(n+1)\n= ZZ(\n\nn+k\nk\n\n).\n\n(4.13)\n\n3\nThe twisting in SU (n) is k + n + 1 times the generator of HH\n(G). By the reasoning in the\n\nlast section, the twisting for the SU (n) subgroup is thus also k + n + 1, which corresponds\nto the level k + 1 in SU (n). (4.7) implies that\n\u03c4\n\n\u266f\n\nKU(n) (SU (n + 1)) =\n\nRU(n)\nk\nISU(n+1)\n\n,\n\n(4.14)\n\nIn the following, only the ZZ-module structure is taken into account, since our main interest\n\nis the rank of the charge lattice, rather than the ring structure.\n\n15\n\n\fin degree dim(SU (n + 1)) and vanishes for the complementary degrees. This can be\nmade more explicit as follows. From Theorem 3 in [36] we know that for a maximal rank\nsubgroup, which is connected and closed\nK(G/H) \u223c\n= RH \u2297RG ZZ ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhere G/H is the right quotient. Applied to the present situation, where SU (n+1)/U (n) =\nCP n , and using the K-theory for complex projective space as computed by Adams in [41],\nthis reads\nRH \u2297RG ZZ \u223c\n= K(CP n ) \u223c\n= ZZn+1 .\n\n(4.16)\n\nTogether with (4.13), (4.14) simplifies therefore to\n\u03c4\n\nn+k\nk\n\nKU(n) (SU (n + 1)) \u223c\n= ZZ(n+1) (\n\n).\n\n(4.17)\n\n4.5. KU(1)n (SU (n + 1))\nFor generalized super-parafermion cosets, we invoke Theorem 1 in [36], which implies,\nthat Ru(1)n is free of rank (n + 1)!, i.e.,\nRU(1)n \u223c\n= RSU(n+1)\n\n\u0001|W |\n\n= RSU(n+1)\n\n\u0001(n+1)!\n\n,\n\n(4.18)\n\nwhere |W | is the order of the Weyl group. Therefore (4.7) results in\n\u03c4\n\nKU(1)n (SU (n + 1)) =\n\nRSU(n+1)\nk\nISU(n+1)\n\n!\u2295(n+1)!\n\nn+k\nk\n\n= ZZ(n+1)!(\n\n).\n\n(4.19)\n\n4.6. Comparison between K-theory and D-brane charges\nTo compare the above K-theoretical results to the charge lattice that the boundary\nconformal field theory and string theory predicts, there are again two subtle points that\nneed to be elucidated. Firstly, as in the SU (2)/U (1) case, the identification rules implied\nby the order n(n + 1) outer automorphism (3.9) necessitate that the K-theory has to\nbe computed with respect to an additional equivariance. The automorphisms (3.10) act\non the affine su(n + 1) weights as outer automorphisms, and thus correspond to central\nelements of the corresponding Lie group SU (n + 1). For this reason, the equivariance in\nthe K-theory for Gr(n, k) is with respect to U (n)/Z, where\n\u001c\n\u0012 2\u03c0i/n\ne\n1In\n2\u03c0i/(n+1)\nZ = ZZn(n+1) = e\n1In+1 ,\n0\n16\n\n0\n1\n\n\u0013\u001d\n\n,\n\n(4.20)\n\n\fwhere the first element generates the center of SU (n + 1) and the second generates the\ncenter of SU (n). This implies\nH/Z = U (n)/ZZn(n+1)\n\nSU (n) \u00d7 U (1)\n=\nZZn\n\n\u001e\n\nZZn(n+1) = U (n)/ZZn+1 .\n\n(4.21)\n\nTherefore there is an additional ZZn+1 identification that needs to be taken into account in\nthe K-theory computation, in order to compare with the boundary conformal field theory.\nNow note that ZZn+1 sits inside U (1) \u2282 U (n), so that the condition on the subgroup being\nconnected still holds. That the above arguments goes through for the H/Z-equivariant\nK-theory\u266e , is seen most directly in the formulation of [3]. Recall from section 4.2, that\nthe twisted equivariant K-theory \u03c4 KH (G) can be computed by taking sections of a sheaf\n\u03c4\n\nK(G), which is defined on H C //H C . There is a natural Z-action on H C //H C , and in\norder to compute the H/Z-equivariant K-theory, one again takes sections of \u03c4 K(G), whose\nstalks are still 1-dimensional, however, the Z-action forces to take invariant sections, which\namounts to identifying the stalks over the points in each orbit of Z. This leads for the\npresent case to an (n + 1)-fold identification of the stalks, and thus, the K-groups, i.e., the\nsections of the sheaf in question, are computed to be\n\u03c4\n\nKU(n)/ZZn+1 (SU (n + 1)) = ZZ(\n\nn+k\nk\n\n).\n\n(4.22)\n\nNote that this is in complete agreement with the charges obtained from the even (odd)\nCardy branes in the CFT. Further, it is consistent with level-rank duality.\nAnalogously, for the generalized superparafermion cosets, the automorphism is of order\nn + 1 and similar reasoning implies that the charge lattice is again given by the dimension\nof the chiral ring\n\u03c4\n\nKU(1)n /ZZn+1 (SU (n + 1)) = ZZn! (\n\nn+k\nk\n\n).\n\n(4.23)\n\nIt would be interesting to check this on the CFT side.\nThe second point that needs to be addressed refers to the D-brane charges as one\nwould expect them from string theory. As discussed in the case of SU (2)/U (1), a full\nstring theoretical treatment would require to GSO project, which in particular necessitates\nto cut down the D-brane spectrum to particular superpositions of RR and NSNS sector\nboundary states. This may serve as an explanation, why the K-theory sees only half of\nthe brane charges of the CFT.\n\u266e\n\nI thank S. Fredenhagen for pointing out some subtleties in this argument.\n\n17\n\n\f5. Conclusions and outlook\nIn this paper we computed twisted equivariant K-groups, as they arise in the context of\nKazama-Suzuki models. In the case of Grassmannian coset models the charges obtained\nfrom the K-theory match with the conformal field theory charges, as obtained from even (or\nodd) A-type Cardy states. The K-theory is obtained as a quotient of the representation ring\nof the denominator group. In particular, the charge lattice satisfies the level-rank duality\nof the bulk theory. Unlike the WZW models, where the twisted K-theory for SU (n + 1),\nn \u2265 3, is strictly larger than the charge lattice of Cardy branes, in the coset model case,\nthe Cardy brane charge lattice (at least for the Grassmannian cosets) is precisely given\nby the twisted equivariant K-theory. However, as we pointed out, there is a subtlety\nregarding the comparison to D-brane charges in string theory, which seems to be rooted\nin the GSO-projection.\nIt would be an interesting check to compute the CFT intersection index in the case of\nthe generalized parafermions, but we shall postpone this to elsewhere. In view of the issue\nrelated to the GSO-projection, it would be interesting to extend the above K-theoretical\ncomputations to e.g., Gepner models, where an unambiguous string theory description is\nat hand, and to compare them to the charges computed in [13,18]. More generally, the\nFHT theorem may be of help in order to shed some more light on the relation between\nBCFT data and twisted K-theory.\n\nAcknowledgments\nIt is a great pleasure to thank Constantin Teleman, for many illuminating discussions on\nK-theory, as well as Matthias Gaberdiel and Greg Moore.
